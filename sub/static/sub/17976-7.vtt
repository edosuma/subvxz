12:00.867 --> 12:02.067
WELL,
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.400
I WANT EVERYTHING
TO COME TO ME FIRST.

12:03.433 --> 12:05.833
SURE, OKAY, UM...
AND ALICE CALLED.

12:05.867 --> 12:06.867
SHE WAS WONDERING

12:06.900 --> 12:08.533
IF YOU CAN MEET HER
AT THE PLANET TONIGHT.

12:08.567 --> 12:09.533
I'M ALREADY GOING. WHY?

12:09.567 --> 12:10.733
WELL, SHE DIDN'T SAY,

12:10.767 --> 12:12.533
JUST IT WAS SOME KIND
OF EMERGENCY MEETING.

12:12.567 --> 12:15.100
[SIGHS]

12:15.133 --> 12:18.267
OH, AND THE, UH, THE CATALOG
FROM THE SCULPTURE

12:18.300 --> 12:20.100
FROM MICHAEL KOHN
GALLERY,

12:20.133 --> 12:22.700
LEIGH OSTIN?

12:30.767 --> 12:34.133
WOULD YOU CALL MICHAEL KOHN
AND GET ME A STUDIO VISIT TODAY?

12:34.167 --> 12:35.367
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.767
THANKS.

12:39.667 --> 12:40.600
HMM.

12:43.900 --> 12:46.333
FUCKING
FUCK, FUCK, FUCK.

12:46.367 --> 12:49.800
HE GAVE ME HIS FUCKING
USELESS WORD.

12:49.833 --> 12:50.833
THE AIR HOSTESS
IS PRODUCING IT?

12:51.800 --> 12:52.767
[CLATTERING]

12:52.800 --> 12:54.933
JESUS.

12:54.967 --> 12:56.600
MARTY JUST DROPPED
OUT OF THE PROJECT.

12:56.633 --> 12:57.900
LET ME GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE.

12:57.933 --> 13:00.667
NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME, RICHARD.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.700
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP MARTY
AS A CLIENT,

13:02.733 --> 13:03.767
YOU WILL PULL HIM
OFF THIS DEAL NOW,

13:03.800 --> 13:05.200
BECAUSE A YEAR
FROM NOW,

13:05.233 --> 13:07.067
HE IS GOING TO FIRE
YOUR SORRY ASS

13:07.100 --> 13:08.667
FOR BLOWING OFF
VERONICA BLOOM

13:08.700 --> 13:09.833
IN FAVOR
OF THE AIR HOSTESS

13:09.867 --> 13:11.867
WHO'S SUCKING HIS COCK!

13:11.900 --> 13:13.433
THAT'S HIS WIFE.

13:13.467 --> 13:15.067
THE PROJECT'S GOING TO
FALL APART WITHOUT MARTY.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.467
SHE'S TAKING IT
ESPECIALLY HARD

13:16.500 --> 13:17.600
BECAUSE THEY USED
TO BE MARRIED.

13:17.633 --> 13:18.633
YOU KNOW?

13:18.667 --> 13:19.700
VERONICA CALLS
HIS NEW WIFE

13:19.733 --> 13:20.800
THE AIR HOSTESS.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.333
NO, RICHARD,
YOU AND YOUR CLIENT

13:22.367 --> 13:24.433
BETTER GET A FUCKING GRIP!

13:27.567 --> 13:28.833
UH...

13:28.867 --> 13:30.067
MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO TO NIGHT?

13:30.067 --> 13:32.333
HE'S APPARENTLY LOOKING
TO DO A PERIOD DRAMA, AND--

13:32.367 --> 13:35.300
YOU WANT ME TO GO FROM MARTY

13:35.333 --> 13:36.967
TO M. NIGHT FUCKING SHYAMALAN?

13:37.067 --> 13:39.067
WHERE WERE YOU
EDUCATED?

13:39.067 --> 13:40.533
DO YOU EVEN
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

13:40.567 --> 13:42.933
BETWEEN WAR AND PEACE

13:42.967 --> 13:44.333
AND A MARVEL FUCKING
COMIC BOOK?

13:46.567 --> 13:47.433
GET OUT!

13:47.467 --> 13:49.433
UNLESS YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY,

13:49.467 --> 13:50.433
GET OUT!

13:50.467 --> 13:51.433
YOU'RE ALL
FUCKING USELESS!

13:51.467 --> 13:52.600
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

13:54.367 --> 13:55.300
NOT YOU.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.800
YOU STAY.

14:03.067 --> 14:04.100
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

14:08.400 --> 14:10.100
WHY DO PEOPLE
ALWAYS LET YOU DOWN?

14:10.133 --> 14:12.667
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU'VE DONE FOR THEM?

14:12.700 --> 14:15.067
DON'T YOU FIND THAT
TO BE TRUE?

14:15.067 --> 14:18.667
THAT'S WHY I TRY NOT TO NEED
ANYTHING FROM ANYONE.

14:23.633 --> 14:26.667
I WANT YOU TO TEACH ME
HOW TO DO THAT.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.133
COME ON.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.100
SIT DOWN.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.500
LET'S GO OUT.

14:39.533 --> 14:42.067
LET'S GO MAKE OURSELVES
FEEL BETTER.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.133

15:22.833 --> 15:23.800
UH-HUH?

15:23.833 --> 15:25.333
OH...

15:25.367 --> 15:28.967
HELLO. I'M LOOKING
FOR THE FABULOUS VENUS DE MYLAR.

15:29.067 --> 15:31.333
YEAH, SO?

15:31.367 --> 15:34.167
I WAS TOLD SHE LIVED HERE.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.500
I'M HER, GIRLIE.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.367

15:43.400 --> 15:45.833
[THUDS AND GROANING]

15:54.667 --> 15:55.733
THAT BETTER?

15:57.467 --> 16:00.733
SO, WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
LITTLE GIRL?

16:00.767 --> 16:01.767
DEE DEE.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.833
DEE DEE STEINBERG.

16:02.867 --> 16:04.233
VICTOR BERNSTEIN.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.333
IT WOULDN'T FLY IN PEORIA.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.900
COME ON, HAVE A SEAT.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.500
SO...

16:15.533 --> 16:17.467
I TAKE IT YOU WANT
TO JOIN THE CIRCUS.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.833
YEAH. HOW DID YOU KNOW?

16:18.867 --> 16:23.133
VENUS CAN SENSE
THESE THINGS, GIRLIE.

16:23.167 --> 16:24.967
SO, WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

16:25.067 --> 16:27.233
I DON'T BELONG ANYWHERE ELSE.

16:27.267 --> 16:29.533
EVERYBODY IN MY FAMILY
THINKS I'M A FREAK, BECAUSE--

16:29.567 --> 16:30.800
YEAH, YEAH,

16:30.833 --> 16:32.100
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY TALENT?

16:32.133 --> 16:34.300
ANY SPECIAL CIRCUS SKILLS?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.900
HOLY BEJEEZUS,
THAT IS SPECIAL,

16:42.933 --> 16:45.133
BUT IT'LL NEVER FLY IN PEORIA.

16:45.167 --> 16:47.800
"...THAT IS SPECIAL,

16:47.833 --> 16:51.500
BUT IT'LL NEVER FLY IN PEORIA."

16:51.533 --> 16:53.467
WELL, WELL.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.300
WHO'D LIKE TO START?

16:56.333 --> 16:59.167
I THOUGHT IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.233
IT WAS REALLY
EXTRAORDINARY.

17:01.267 --> 17:02.700
IT CALLS TO MIND RICK MOODY.

17:02.733 --> 17:03.700
HAVE YOU EVER READ DEMONOLOGY?

17:03.733 --> 17:07.933
NO, I'M SORRY.

17:07.967 --> 17:12.867
UM, WHAT ABOUT
JENNY'S STORY "LUMINOUS"

17:12.900 --> 17:14.300
EVOKED RICK MOODY
FOR YOU?

17:14.333 --> 17:16.567
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THERE'S THAT STORY

17:16.600 --> 17:18.600
CALLED "THE CARNIVAL TRADITION."

17:18.633 --> 17:20.533
UH, BUT IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS,
I KNOW, BUT IT'S MORE--

17:20.567 --> 17:22.067
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

17:22.067 --> 17:25.467
SO IT WASN'T
THE CARNIVAL ALLUSION

17:25.500 --> 17:26.900
THAT REMINDED YOU OF MOODY.

17:26.933 --> 17:29.233
ISN'T IT MORE
THAT MOODY AND JENNY

17:29.267 --> 17:31.833
BOTH WRITE ABOUT
AND REVEAL

17:31.867 --> 17:33.900
THE GROTESQUE THAT'S HIDDEN
UNDERNEATH THE MUNDANE?

17:33.933 --> 17:36.067
ABSOLUTELY.

17:36.067 --> 17:38.300
I FEEL LIKE JENNY
IS TO THE MIDWEST

17:38.333 --> 17:39.333
AS CARSON MCCULLERS
IS TO THE SOUTH.

17:39.367 --> 17:41.700
IT'S, UH, IT'S GOTHIC.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.733
IT'S GROTESQUE,

17:43.767 --> 17:44.667
AND YET ALWAYS
DELIVERED

17:44.700 --> 17:46.467
WITH SELF-DEPRECATING
HUMOR.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.567
OH, THAT'S VERY
GENEROUS OF YOU.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.967
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY THAT A WRITER
IN THE BLOOM OF YOUTH

17:51.067 --> 17:53.467
GETS COMPARED
TO CARSON MCCULLERS.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.067
IT'S VERY GENEROUS,
DON'T YOU THINK, JENNY?

17:55.067 --> 17:56.633
YES, I DO.

17:56.667 --> 17:57.700
THANK YOU, HUNTER.

17:57.733 --> 17:59.733
CHARLOTTE,
DO YOU HAVE

17:59.767 --> 18:02.700
ANY QUESTIONS
OR COMMENTS FOR ME?

18:02.733 --> 18:03.833
IF I WERE YOU,

18:03.867 --> 18:05.100
I'D LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

18:05.133 --> 18:07.767
I THINK HUNTER
HAS ACQUITTED YOU ADMIRABLY.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.867
THANK YOU, CHARLOTTE.

18:13.967 --> 18:17.533
SO WHY SHOULDN'T I
BECOME A LESBIAN?

18:17.567 --> 18:20.533
UH...

18:20.567 --> 18:22.633
BECAUSE WOMEN
ARE INTENSE.

18:22.667 --> 18:23.767
THEY'RE A LOT
OF WORK.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.400
THEY CAN
SUCK YOU DRY.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.100
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO TRY THIS, SHANE?

18:28.133 --> 18:29.867
THE RESULTS
ARE AMAZING.

18:31.533 --> 18:33.100
THANKS.

18:33.133 --> 18:34.433
WHAT YOU DON'T
KNOW ABOUT ME

18:34.467 --> 18:35.667
IS THAT I LIKE
INTENSITY.

18:35.700 --> 18:36.833
[GRUNTS IN PAIN]

18:36.867 --> 18:39.133
WHEN THINGS AREN'T
INTENSE, I GET BORED...

18:39.167 --> 18:41.233
[WINCING] AND
WHEN I AM BORED,

18:41.267 --> 18:45.100
I WANT TO KILL MYSELF!

18:45.133 --> 18:46.200
WELL, WATCH OUT.

18:46.233 --> 18:49.200
MOTHERFUCKER!

18:50.133 --> 18:51.200
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:51.233 --> 18:53.800
YOU HAVE POTENTIAL.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.100
YOU STICK WITH ME, KID.

18:55.133 --> 19:00.433
I'M GOING TO HELP YOU
REALIZE IT.

19:00.467 --> 19:02.967

19:03.067 --> 19:05.333
OH, FUCK...

19:05.367 --> 19:09.100
[GROANING]

19:09.133 --> 19:10.167
OH, YEAH!

19:10.200 --> 19:13.067
EXQUISITE.

19:14.900 --> 19:18.067
THEY MUST TAKE FOREVER
TO ASSEMBLE.

19:18.100 --> 19:21.067
I WORK ON EACH PIECE
FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.867
USUALLY I'M WORKING ON
TWO OR THREE PIECES

19:22.900 --> 19:24.567
AT A TIME,

19:24.600 --> 19:28.767
BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
I'M NOT EXACTLY PROLIFIC.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.067
WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN
THIS WORK BEFORE?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.367
I ACTUALLY THINK

19:32.400 --> 19:34.067
MICHAEL'S BEEN TRYING
TO GET YOU IN HERE FOR AGES.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.600
[LAUGHS SHORTLY]

19:35.633 --> 19:37.900
WELL, I'M GLAD I FINALLY
CAME TO MY SENSES.

19:37.933 --> 19:40.267
ME TOO.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.067
THIS WORK I DON'T
NORMALLY SHOW.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.133
THESE ARE ALL
STRAIGHT-UP COPIES

19:48.167 --> 19:49.833
OF CLASSIC
RENAISSANCE PAINTINGS.

19:49.867 --> 19:50.833
OH...

19:50.867 --> 19:52.600
I'M USUALLY WORKING ON
TWO AT A TIME.

19:52.633 --> 19:58.067
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
DOES THIS ANYMORE.

19:58.100 --> 20:01.300
IT'S THRILLING,
ISN'T IT?

20:01.333 --> 20:02.933
LEIGH, DO YOU KNOW
MY SISTER'S CLUB,

20:02.967 --> 20:04.700
THE PLANET?

20:04.733 --> 20:06.000
IT USED TO BE A CAFE?

20:06.033 --> 20:08.033
YEAH, IT STILL IS
DURING THE DAY,

20:08.067 --> 20:09.900
BUT KIT'S HIRING A CHEF,

20:09.933 --> 20:11.433
AND SHE'S LOOKING
TO BRING IN MUSICIANS

20:11.467 --> 20:12.933
A COUPLE NIGHTS A WEEK.

20:12.967 --> 20:14.667
SHARON ISBIN IS PERFORMING
THERE TONIGHT.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.733
I SAW HER PLAY
WITH THE NEW YORK PHIL

20:16.767 --> 20:18.367
LAST JUNE AT AVERY FISHER HALL.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.933
LOOK, THE CD ACTUALLY
JUST CAME OUT.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.767
HERE.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.767
WELL, THIS WILL BE
A BIT MORE INTIMATE.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.867
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN ME?

20:35.533 --> 20:37.033
ACTUALLY, IT'S, UM, VALERIE

20:37.067 --> 20:39.433
WHO'S THE CLASSICAL MUSIC
AFICIONADO.

20:39.467 --> 20:40.433
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF SHE CAME, TOO?

20:41.667 --> 20:42.633
HI.

20:42.667 --> 20:43.733
HI.

20:43.767 --> 20:45.133
HEY, SWEETIE.

20:45.167 --> 20:47.867
UM, YEAH, SURE.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.633
I DID JENNY,
SHANE, AND CARMEN.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.067
OH, CARMEN'S ALREADY
GOING TO BE WORKING THERE,

20:52.100 --> 20:53.600
BUT I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE NICE

20:53.633 --> 20:55.733
IF I CALLED HER
AND OFFICIALLY ASKED HER.

20:55.767 --> 20:57.900
RIGHT, AND I DID
BETTE AND TINA.

20:57.933 --> 20:59.167
I MEAN, TINA WANTED
TO INVITE HELENA,

20:59.200 --> 21:00.267
AND I WAS LIKE, "TINA,

21:00.300 --> 21:01.333
THAT'S NOT COOL
TO BETTE."

21:01.367 --> 21:02.667
AW...

21:02.700 --> 21:04.400
YOU'RE SO SMART,
AND SO THOUGHTFUL.

21:04.433 --> 21:06.533
NAH,

21:06.567 --> 21:07.667
BUT YOU DIDN'T
TELL ANYBODY

21:07.700 --> 21:10.167
WHAT IT WAS ABOUT,
DID YOU?

21:10.200 --> 21:11.233
NO.

21:11.267 --> 21:12.567
OKAY,

21:12.600 --> 21:14.067
BUT IT'S, YOU KNOW...

21:14.067 --> 21:15.433
I JUST, I THINK
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

21:15.467 --> 21:16.900
THAT WE TELL EVERYONE
AT THE SAME TIME.

21:16.933 --> 21:18.067
BECAUSE SOMEONE'S
GOING TO FEEL LESS IMPORTANT

21:18.100 --> 21:19.133
THAN SOMEBODY ELSE.

21:19.167 --> 21:20.567
BUT SHANE
ALREADY KNOWS.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.833
YEAH, BUT SHANE
DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY.

21:22.867 --> 21:24.067
SHE'S, LIKE, THE ONLY
PERSON ON EARTH

21:24.067 --> 21:25.600
WHO CAN ACTUALLY
KEEP A SECRET.

21:34.767 --> 21:37.967
YOU GUYS, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL,
SUNNY AFTERNOON.

21:38.067 --> 21:39.900
WHAT ARE YOU DOING INSIDE
WATCHING TELEVISION?

21:39.933 --> 21:41.400
WE'RE WATCHING CARTOONS!

21:41.433 --> 21:43.600
WELL, I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING

21:43.633 --> 21:45.800
THAT IS GOING TO BE
MUCH MORE FUN

21:45.833 --> 21:48.067
THAN SITTING INSIDE
AND GETTING CROSS-EYED.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.333
TINA, TINA,
POPSICLE STICKS!

21:50.367 --> 21:52.067
WILL YOU BUILD A FORT
WITH ME?

21:52.100 --> 21:53.533
YES.

21:53.567 --> 21:54.733
WILSON...

21:54.767 --> 21:56.267
NU NU WILL BUILD A FORT
WITH YOU, DARLING.

21:56.300 --> 21:59.700
TINA HAS TO COME AND SPEND
A LITTLE TIME WITH MAMA.

22:51.067 --> 22:52.633
HELENA...

22:52.667 --> 22:53.933
WHAT?

22:53.967 --> 22:57.200
YOUR CHILDREN
ARE JUST INSIDE.

22:57.233 --> 23:00.067
BUT THEY'RE
COMPLETELY ENGAGED

23:00.067 --> 23:03.400
IN BRILLIANTLY WHOLESOME
ART-MAKING ACTIVITIES.

47:15.233 --> 47:17.300
AND HE WOUND UP
DRINKING ALL THIS WATER--

47:17.333 --> 47:18.767
YEAH, JUST...

47:18.800 --> 47:20.167
I'M GOING TO BE THERE
IN, LIKE, 20 MINUTES.

47:20.200 --> 47:22.200
JUST DON'T DRINK A LOT OF WATER.

47:22.233 --> 47:23.267
[DOOR SLAMS]

47:27.133 --> 47:28.733
SCHECTER....

47:30.933 --> 47:33.633
THAT WAS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY,

47:33.667 --> 47:35.800
AND YOU KNOW BETTER.

47:35.833 --> 47:38.833
UM...

47:38.867 --> 47:40.500
BUT I-- BUT I--

47:40.533 --> 47:41.833
I SPOKE MY MIND.

47:41.867 --> 47:43.200
I MEAN, THE THING IS,

47:43.233 --> 47:46.800
I'VE BEEN SUBJECT TO SOME REALLY
HARSH CRITICISM IN THIS CLASS,

47:46.833 --> 47:48.067
AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE IT

47:48.067 --> 47:49.633
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S YOUR JOB
AS A WRITER,

47:49.667 --> 47:51.500
TO BE ABLE TO TAKE
THAT KIND OF CRITICISM.

47:51.533 --> 47:53.867
MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE
THAT EVERYONE BECOMES

47:53.900 --> 47:55.667
THE BEST WRITER
HE OR SHE CAN BE.

47:55.700 --> 47:57.133
THERE ISN'T ONE STANDARD.

47:57.167 --> 47:58.200
THERE ARE MANY.

47:58.233 --> 47:59.533
AND I THINK
IT'S TIME

47:59.567 --> 48:01.467
THAT YOU STEP UP
TO THE PLATE

48:01.500 --> 48:02.533
AND START LIVING

48:02.567 --> 48:03.533
ACCORDING
TO THE STANDARD

48:03.567 --> 48:04.633
I'VE SET FOR YOU.

48:04.667 --> 48:06.667
OKAY, BUT WHAT
IS YOUR STANDARD?

48:06.700 --> 48:07.700
BECAUSE THE THING IS,

48:07.733 --> 48:09.067
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME,

48:09.067 --> 48:11.233
OR YOU THINK OF MY WRITING,
BECAUSE--

48:11.267 --> 48:13.067
I HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT FOR YOU.

48:14.733 --> 48:16.400
WHAT?

48:16.433 --> 48:19.067
DO YOU WANT ME
TO BLINDFOLD MYSELF

48:19.100 --> 48:21.833
AND WALK INTO
A BUSY INTERSECTION,

48:21.867 --> 48:24.400
SO I CAN FEEL MORE
WITH MY WRITING?

48:24.433 --> 48:25.567
I WANT YOU TO CALL MY FRIEND

48:25.600 --> 48:26.633
BURR CONNOR.

48:26.667 --> 48:27.700
DO YOU KNOW
WHO HE IS?

48:27.733 --> 48:29.067
UM...

48:29.067 --> 48:30.233
YES.

48:30.267 --> 48:33.600
ISN'T HE, LIKE,
THAT OLD-SCHOOL MOVIE STAR?

48:33.633 --> 48:36.467
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE SILENT ERA.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.167
HE WAS AN ACTION STAR
IN THE MID-'80S.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.400
BUT HE'S
AN INTERESTING MAN,

48:39.433 --> 48:42.500
AND HE'S WRITING HIS MEMOIRS
FOR DUTTON.

48:44.200 --> 48:45.400
WHY DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL HIM?

48:45.433 --> 48:46.567
BECAUSE
HE NEEDS HELP.

48:46.600 --> 48:48.900
HE NEEDS SOMEONE
TO REDACT HIS STORIES,

48:48.933 --> 48:51.067
SOMEONE
TO GIVE STRUCTURE,

48:51.067 --> 48:54.867
AND HE NEEDS SOMEONE TO PUSH HIM
TO DIG A LITTLE DEEPER

48:54.900 --> 48:57.133
TO TELL THE TRUTHS
THAT ARE HARDER TO FIND,

48:57.167 --> 49:01.100
AND I TOLD HIM YOU WERE
MY MOST GIFTED STUDENT.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.733
TAKE THE CARD.
CALL HIM.

49:13.133 --> 49:15.100
SAILBOATS.

49:17.133 --> 49:18.467
IT'S STAYING.

49:18.500 --> 49:20.200
I KNOW, BECAUSE
YOU'RE SO GOOD AT IT.

49:20.233 --> 49:22.833
DO YOU WANT TO DO
SOME MORE GLUE RIGHT HERE?

49:22.867 --> 49:24.067
OKAY.

49:24.067 --> 49:26.467
OKAY, SEE
IF YOU CAN DO THAT.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.467
YEAH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

49:27.500 --> 49:28.533
THIS ONE'S
GOING TO BE HARD

49:28.567 --> 49:29.633
BECAUSE IT'S,
LIKE, TILTED.

49:29.667 --> 49:30.733
DO YOU THINK
MORE GLUE,

49:30.767 --> 49:32.467
LIKE, ON THE ENDS?

49:32.500 --> 49:33.533
JUST KEEP ON GLUING.

49:33.567 --> 49:34.567
I'M GOING TO MAKE
A QUICK PHONE CALL.

49:34.600 --> 49:36.500
OKAY?

49:51.067 --> 49:54.067
BETTE, IT'S TINA.

49:54.067 --> 49:57.233
I KNOW WE'RE GETTING TOGETHER
NEXT WEDNESDAY, BUT, UH...

49:57.267 --> 50:00.133
I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I'VE BEEN, UH...

HI.

51:05.267 --> 51:06.600
JEEZ, I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

51:06.633 --> 51:08.700
I WAS JUST
LOOKING FOR TINA.

51:08.733 --> 51:09.867
TINA DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

51:09.900 --> 51:12.067
UH, I'M SANDY.

51:12.067 --> 51:14.067
SHE USED TO BUY FROZEN MEAT
AND FISH FROM ME,

51:14.067 --> 51:15.633
USUALLY STOCKED UP
A COUPLE OF TIMES A YEAR?

51:15.667 --> 51:18.733
YEAH, I REMEMBER YOU.

51:18.767 --> 51:21.233
DO YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT WANT SOMETHING?

51:21.267 --> 51:23.867
UM, I DON'T REALLY DO THAT MUCH
COOKING ON MY OWN, SO--

51:23.900 --> 51:25.200
WELL, LET ME
GIVE YOU A BOX

51:25.233 --> 51:28.600

51:28.633 --> 51:31.467
MAYBE I COULD COME BY

51:35.733 --> 51:38.167
[CHUCKLES]

51:41.800 --> 51:43.933

BE PART OF HER LIFE.
