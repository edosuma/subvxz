WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:04.083
All right, let's bring up
our class valedictorian,

00:04.166 --> 00:05.250
Milton Krupnick.

00:05.333 --> 00:06.250
Milton?

00:07.792 --> 00:09.625
Yeah, Milton!

00:09.709 --> 00:11.333
When I was three,

00:11.417 --> 00:14.583
I remember looking up at the moon
with a sense of wonder.

00:14.667 --> 00:17.458
Whoo! Great speech, Milton!

00:17.542 --> 00:18.458
I'll get the car.

00:18.542 --> 00:19.625
Rudy.

00:19.709 --> 00:23.208
We are here to support Milton graduating
from the Junior Astronaut Program.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.125
We are staying until the end.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.166
And now, a poem.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.542
Get the car.

00:30.458 --> 00:32.458
<i>Space, oh, space...</i>

00:32.542 --> 00:34.083
You're into space?

00:35.291 --> 00:36.500
Yeah, me too.

00:36.709 --> 00:38.750
I'm gonna be the first guy
to walk on the sun.

00:39.875 --> 00:42.458
I know what you're thinking,
"It's too hot."

00:43.125 --> 00:44.875
I'm going at night.

00:47.542 --> 00:49.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:49.542 --> 00:51.959
We're not. Where were you two hours ago?

00:52.041 --> 00:54.083
I just got off the phone
with the president,

00:54.166 --> 00:56.750
and he's informed me that our friends,
the Russians,

00:56.834 --> 00:59.959
are planning on sending
a 17-year-old boy into space!

01:00.041 --> 01:01.458
Wait, what?

01:01.667 --> 01:03.542
That would be the youngest astronaut ever.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
That's a record that we've held for years,

01:06.083 --> 01:08.667
and we intend on keeping it!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.583
General Jones, what are you saying?

01:10.667 --> 01:13.959
I am saying that you, Milton D. Krupnick,

01:14.041 --> 01:16.000
are going into space!

01:18.041 --> 01:19.917
Holy Christmas nuts!

02:06.917 --> 02:09.250
I can't believe General Jones
convinced my mom

02:09.333 --> 02:10.875
to let me go into outer space.

02:10.959 --> 02:12.834
That's the same woman
who makes me wear floaties

02:12.917 --> 02:14.500
when I run through the sprinklers.

02:15.250 --> 02:16.750
Your floatie days are over, Milton.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.250
You're better than everyone else.

02:18.333 --> 02:19.458
You're an astronaut now.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.250
That's why we had to give you
the whole new look.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.208
Gunnar, thanks for taking me shopping,
but I'm not sure I can pull this off.

02:29.291 --> 02:30.417
Sure you can. You look great.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.000
No, I literally can't pull
these pants off.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.333
I've had them on for two days.

02:34.875 --> 02:37.208
Milton, you're
in the Space Program now, okay?

02:37.291 --> 02:38.458
You gotta walk the walk.

02:45.959 --> 02:48.083
You know, Milton,
things are gonna be different now.

02:48.166 --> 02:49.625
We didn't even have to pay for that meal.

02:49.709 --> 02:51.333
We may have eaten at Phil's for free,

02:51.375 --> 02:53.709
but trust me,
we're gonna pay for that meal.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.709
Ugh. Smell something burning.

02:56.792 --> 02:59.709
Oh, it's just my pants.
I think I was walking too fast.

02:59.792 --> 03:02.125
You know, being an astronaut's
a whole new way of life, Milton.

03:02.208 --> 03:03.250
Check this out.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.667
I'm Gunnar Nelson, astronaut.

03:15.208 --> 03:17.875
I'm not gonna rely on my title
just to get girls.

03:17.959 --> 03:20.500
I'll just rely on the old Krupnick charm.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.625
Hey, girls.

03:26.083 --> 03:29.291
I mean, they don't have to know
that I'm an astronaut.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.000
Whoa. Right here.

03:33.083 --> 03:34.542
Yeah. That's the charm--

03:37.834 --> 03:39.125
Milton, I'm gonna say something

03:39.208 --> 03:40.834
I never thought I'd have to say
in my life.

03:40.917 --> 03:41.959
Uh...

03:43.041 --> 03:44.542
You gotta help me get girls.

03:47.458 --> 03:49.583
I can't make you an astronaut, Jerry.

03:49.667 --> 03:51.458
No, but you can get me a job
at the Space Center,

03:51.542 --> 03:53.458
so I can get one
of those magic lady badges.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.959
I'll talk to the General,
but you gotta do me a favor.

03:57.041 --> 03:57.917
Anything.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.417
Help me get these pants off.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.417
I really gotta go to the bathroom.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.709
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

04:08.500 --> 04:10.125
Ooh.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.583
Rudy, how you doing?

04:11.667 --> 04:13.291
Oh, not good.

04:13.375 --> 04:15.375
You know, I had a weird dream last night

04:15.458 --> 04:17.000
I had a baby alien in me,

04:17.083 --> 04:19.375
and now I got the shakes

04:19.458 --> 04:21.625
and my stomach feels like
a roller coaster.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.959
What is happening to me?

04:27.375 --> 04:28.750
Somebody help me!

04:28.834 --> 04:30.000
Help me!

04:33.250 --> 04:37.000
Rudy, we know about the new movie makeup
and special effects store in the mall.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.667
You should have seen your faces.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.250
I totally got you!

04:41.333 --> 04:43.083
Ooh, ooh! Here comes Murray.

04:43.166 --> 04:44.458
I'm gonna go scare him.

04:47.208 --> 04:48.375
What's the matter, Rudy?

04:48.458 --> 04:49.500
Oh, it's my stomach.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.625
I think I have an alien in me!

04:54.333 --> 04:56.250
That alien doesn't scare me.

04:56.333 --> 04:57.917
Have you ever seen my wife?

04:59.166 --> 05:01.125
Come on. Your wife is--

05:03.125 --> 05:04.250
So what's new, Murray?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.208
Oh, my bingo game is in the toilet.

05:08.667 --> 05:12.041
I was one game away
from winning a trip to Spain.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.083
I was gonna run with the bulls.

05:15.166 --> 05:18.792
Anyway, this Bernice shows up
about three weeks ago

05:18.875 --> 05:20.625
and she wins every game.

05:20.709 --> 05:21.917
Every game.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.875
A hundred and twelve straight.

05:24.333 --> 05:25.709
A hundred and twelve wins?

05:25.792 --> 05:26.709
Yep.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.667
Well, doesn't that seem
a little odd, Rudy?

05:28.750 --> 05:30.375
Yeah, it certainly does.

05:30.583 --> 05:32.709
Do you want us to come down there
and check it out for you?

05:32.792 --> 05:35.500
Oh, thanks.
I knew my friends would help me out.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.166
I love that new store.

05:45.250 --> 05:48.458
So it sounds to me
like you're saying they don't exist.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.792
We only have time
for one more question, Chappy.

05:51.875 --> 05:55.625
And it cannot be related
to hot alien space women.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.166
Oh. All right.

06:01.458 --> 06:02.625
No.

06:03.583 --> 06:04.834
Definitely no.

06:06.625 --> 06:07.917
I have no more questions.

06:08.291 --> 06:09.959
Uh, excuse me, General,

06:10.041 --> 06:12.458
were you able to find a job
for my friend Jerry?

06:12.792 --> 06:16.208
Milton, your friend may be the least
qualified applicant I've ever seen.

06:16.917 --> 06:20.375
But as a favor to you, I found him a job.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.417
Jerry's going to be watching
my wife's cat Wiggy,

06:29.500 --> 06:30.875
while she's out of town.

06:32.166 --> 06:35.166
And I love this little furball.

06:38.208 --> 06:39.875
I got my badge, yo.

06:39.959 --> 06:42.000
Come on, Milton. I'm throwing you a party.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.875
It's gonna be crazy!

06:43.959 --> 06:45.959
There's gonna be celebrities, supermodels,

06:46.041 --> 06:49.417
and I even have a statue of you
carved out of cheddar cheese.

06:49.500 --> 06:53.208
Oh, that's pretty ironic
for a boy who's lactose intolerant.

06:54.125 --> 06:55.417
Dude, I'm in.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.166
Let me just go change Wiggy's litter box.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.041
Yeah, Milton,

06:59.125 --> 07:01.458
Jerry doesn't really belong
at your party, okay?

07:01.542 --> 07:03.166
He's not one of us.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.792
But Jerry's my best friend.

07:04.875 --> 07:07.750
Well then, maybe you should be the one
to tell him he can't come.

07:08.875 --> 07:10.500
<i>Whoo!</i>

07:10.583 --> 07:11.959
Yo, sorry it took so long.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.834
Look at the size of this hairball, man.
It was a real struggle to get it out.

07:15.417 --> 07:17.083
Wiggy finally coughed that up?

07:17.166 --> 07:18.166
Oh, no, I did.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.083
That's the price you pay
when you lick your own pits.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.667
All right, let's hit this party.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.375
Uh, Jerry?

07:25.667 --> 07:27.750
See, the thing is, um...

07:28.709 --> 07:30.792
Uh, you're not really an astronaut,

07:31.500 --> 07:33.125
so you can't come to the party.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.250
I'm sorry.

07:36.333 --> 07:37.375
Oh.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.333
I see.

07:41.375 --> 07:44.000
What was I thinking?

07:44.250 --> 07:45.625
Me going to an astronaut's party?

07:45.709 --> 07:47.083
No. It's fine.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.083
No, I'll just stay here
and share a can of Furry Feast

07:50.166 --> 07:51.250
with Wiggy the Cat.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.834
Jerry, you know your badge
allows you to eat in the cafeteria.

07:58.041 --> 08:01.083
Yeah, well, I wouldn't leave Wiggy alone.

08:01.166 --> 08:02.709
'Cause he's my friend.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.667
You don't do that to a--

08:09.875 --> 08:11.375
All right.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.709
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

08:17.792 --> 08:20.709
Bernice just got in line behind you.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.750
You think she's involved
in some kind of hanky-panky?

08:23.834 --> 08:24.667
I don't know.

08:24.750 --> 08:27.917
But winning 112 games in a row
smells like hanky.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.041
And where you find hanky,
you're gonna find panky.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.250
Hey, Murray. Here's your card.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.625
- Oh, thank you.
- You got it.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.709
Hey, sorry, folks.

08:37.792 --> 08:38.875
Can't let you in.

08:38.959 --> 08:41.709
We've got a strict over-65 policy.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.250
Oh, no, it's okay. We're with Murray.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.500
Don't care.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.917
Very strict policy.

08:48.208 --> 08:49.834
Hey, Ma. Come on in.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.291
Kept your regular spot for you.

08:54.208 --> 08:55.542
Hey, you hear that?

08:56.667 --> 08:58.709
He just called Bernice his mother.

08:58.792 --> 09:00.375
They're definitely up to something.

09:00.458 --> 09:02.083
We gotta get in there, but how?

09:02.166 --> 09:03.291
I got it.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.917
Okay, let's go to the new store
in the mall.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.041
Well, what are they gonna do?

09:06.125 --> 09:07.333
You'll see.

09:15.750 --> 09:19.417
I can't wait to play bingo.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.542
I'm feeling lucky, baby.

09:22.917 --> 09:25.375
Hey, slow down, you two.

09:25.458 --> 09:27.417
Where's the fire?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.208
<i>Come on, Wiggy.</i>

09:35.792 --> 09:37.291
Where are you?

09:39.750 --> 09:41.375
You don't belong in here.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.875
I got an open can of Furry Feast for you.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.375
Aha!

09:54.083 --> 09:55.250
Bad kitty.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.250
Now, you shouldn't be in here.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.208
Only astronauts allowed.

09:59.959 --> 10:02.709
No, we couldn't possibly
be smart enough to be astronauts

10:02.792 --> 10:05.417
and figure out how to press
a bunch of buttons.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.959
<i>Launch sequence initiated.</i>

10:13.041 --> 10:14.709

10:34.458 --> 10:36.250

10:36.333 --> 10:38.166
The music was bumping so loud,

10:38.250 --> 10:41.041
the floor was vibrating
like you launched the shuttle.

10:42.083 --> 10:43.959
<i>Do you know somebody
launched the shuttle?</i>

10:44.041 --> 10:46.208
Yes. Yes, I do.

10:46.625 --> 10:48.709
Somebody manually launched it from inside.

10:48.792 --> 10:51.166
<i>We're establishing communications now.</i>

10:51.250 --> 10:52.875
Who would be stupid enough to--

10:52.959 --> 10:55.166
<i>Whoo!</i>

10:57.208 --> 10:58.917
Holy Christmas nuts!

Sweet rings of Saturn!

General, what are we gonna do?

11:10.458 --> 11:11.667
Don't worry.

<i>I won't lose you.

I was talking to the cat.

Now you listen up, son.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.250
I'm going to talk you in.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.583
<i>First thing's first.</i>

11:24.667 --> 11:26.083
<i>If you look to your left,</i>

11:26.166 --> 11:28.750
<i>you will see a large green button.</i>

11:28.834 --> 11:29.750
Got it.

11:29.834 --> 11:32.166
-
<i>- Whatever you do, don't press it.</i>

11:32.250 --> 11:34.375
Huh?

11:35.750 --> 11:38.500
You might want to lead
with what I'm not supposed to do.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.625
Oh, he short-circuited
the electrical system,

11:40.709 --> 11:41.792
blew the fuel cells,

11:41.875 --> 11:43.792
and caused a giant hole
in the heat shields.

11:44.417 --> 11:46.083
The shuttle's too damaged.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.291
It'll never survive re-entry.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.083
There's no way
to bring my little Wiggy home.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.583
Seaford, we have a problem.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.417
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

11:59.500 --> 12:01.417
You and I will watch Bernice.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.208
Kim, you keep an eye on Zeke.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.792
Should we tell Murray it's us?

12:04.875 --> 12:06.667
No, that's the worst thing you can do.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.667
The man has absolutely no ability
to keep a secret.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.458
I have a mole on my butt

12:12.542 --> 12:14.041
the size of a pumpkin.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.333
- Hello.
- Hey.

12:18.417 --> 12:20.083
Hi, I'm Bernice.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.458
Would you two fellas like a gingersnap?

12:22.542 --> 12:24.291
Oh, no thank you.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.041
I'm still full from lunch.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.041
I had a corned beef sandwich
that was so tender

12:28.125 --> 12:29.542
I didn't even have to put my teeth in.

12:31.750 --> 12:32.583
That's nothing.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.625
You know what I had for lunch?

12:34.709 --> 12:36.458
A double prune smoothie.

12:36.542 --> 12:38.709
Now that's the gift
that just keeps on giving.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.542
Ooh, I like turtles.

12:42.625 --> 12:45.000
Don't touch my lucky turtle.

12:45.583 --> 12:46.959
Gingersnap?

12:50.792 --> 12:52.834
So, uh, Mission Control,

12:52.917 --> 12:55.583
you guys gonna tell me how to bring
this baby back down or what?

12:55.667 --> 12:57.291
<i>Jerry, you're in a situation</i>

12:57.375 --> 13:00.542
we call C-411-7.

13:00.625 --> 13:01.959
Oh, that doesn't sound so bad.

13:02.041 --> 13:03.500
<i>Now let's see here.</i>

13:03.583 --> 13:07.875
Okay, uh, C-411-7.

13:08.333 --> 13:11.542
"Bend over and kiss your butt goodbye."

13:11.625 --> 13:12.542
Hmm.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.750
I mean, I don't see how that's gonna help,
but I'll give it a shot.

13:16.291 --> 13:17.291
Jerry...

13:18.333 --> 13:19.834
Things aren't good.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.792
We don't have a way to get you back.

13:22.875 --> 13:24.458
But I want to come back.

13:25.542 --> 13:27.625
I mean, there's no food up here, Milton.
I'll starve.

13:27.709 --> 13:28.917
Don't worry about starving, Jerry.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.417
Once you lose pressure in the cabin

13:30.500 --> 13:32.333
- your head will pop off like that so...
-

13:33.667 --> 13:35.208
Get him out of here!

13:35.834 --> 13:37.000
Now!

13:38.542 --> 13:40.375
Jerry, this is all my fault.

13:40.458 --> 13:42.750
<i>I should have just taken you
to the party with me.</i>

13:42.834 --> 13:46.417
If word gets out about this,
it'll be an international embarrassment.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.500
We have to stage a massive cover-up.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.625
This is Chappy Chapman reporting
from the scene

13:51.709 --> 13:53.542
of what appears to be a massive cover-up.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.834
- There is no cover-up!
- Huh.

13:55.917 --> 13:57.959
And even if there is,
I'm in no way responsible for it.

13:58.041 --> 13:58.959
Huh! There you have it.

13:59.041 --> 14:02.166
That's General Jones, clearly jumping ship
from the biggest scandal

14:02.250 --> 14:03.542
in SASA history.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.000
Back to you, Brittany.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.458
Out!

14:07.667 --> 14:09.125
That's it.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.500
Jump ship.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.250
Jerry, you're coming home
'cause you're gonna jump.

14:13.375 --> 14:14.792
Hoo-rah!

14:14.875 --> 14:15.917
What?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.625
I'm sorry, did you say "jump"?

14:24.583 --> 14:25.792
B...

14:28.125 --> 14:29.125
Seven.

14:32.125 --> 14:33.792
That's ten numbers in a row.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.458
And Bernice keeps tapping that turtle.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.542
It must be connected by a wire.

14:39.291 --> 14:40.291
Rudy.

14:40.375 --> 14:41.500
I've been watching Zeke,

14:41.583 --> 14:44.583
and he keeps switching the bingo balls
so Bernice always gets a match.

14:44.667 --> 14:45.750
That's how they do it.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.000
She uses the turtle to tell him
what number she needs.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.000
And then, he switches the balls
to match it.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.250
Exactly.

14:51.709 --> 14:52.750
Excuse me.

14:52.834 --> 14:53.875
Everyone.

14:55.709 --> 14:57.250
Put down your markers.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.458
I've got something to say about Bernice.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.834
Well, if it's about her gingersnaps,
we know.

15:01.917 --> 15:03.125
They're dry.

15:04.583 --> 15:06.166
No, it's about the scam.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.542
She won the last 112 games

15:08.625 --> 15:09.792
because she's cheating.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.500
How dare you!

15:11.583 --> 15:12.709
Boys.

15:12.792 --> 15:15.041
Uh, maybe you could explain why
there's a wire

15:15.125 --> 15:17.583
coming from under the table
to your turtle.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.625
I think it's time for you three to leave.

15:26.375 --> 15:29.375
You probably shouldn't have done that,
sonny boy.

15:48.709 --> 15:51.375
You guys should get some stronger tables.

16:08.959 --> 16:10.375
Help your brother out of there.

16:10.458 --> 16:12.333
Come on. Come on.

16:12.417 --> 16:14.125
-
Come on.

16:14.208 --> 16:17.041
I taught you boys better than this.
Get along.

16:18.709 --> 16:21.000
Rudy, Jack, Kim.

16:21.291 --> 16:23.417
I can't believe you did this for us.

16:23.667 --> 16:26.083
Now, let's get back to bingo.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.959
I've got a trip to Spain to win.

16:28.041 --> 16:29.458
<i>-
- Wait.</i>

16:29.542 --> 16:30.667
Guys, turn on the TV.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.875
I just got a text
that Jerry is all over the news.

16:33.583 --> 16:34.750
News?

16:38.542 --> 16:40.291
<i>Jerry Martinez is about to jump</i>

16:40.417 --> 16:42.750
<i>from the space shuttle
and freefall back to Earth.</i>

16:43.250 --> 16:45.917
<i>I think I speak for the entire nation
when I say,</i>

16:46.000 --> 16:47.750
<i>we only hope that boy's lifeless body</i>

16:47.834 --> 16:49.625
<i>does not land on my new car.</i>

16:49.709 --> 16:51.125
<i>Back to you, Brittany.</i>

16:54.917 --> 16:56.250
<i>Okay, Jerry.</i>

16:56.375 --> 16:57.625
<i>You got the space suit on?</i>

16:58.458 --> 16:59.458
Yeah.

16:59.542 --> 17:03.500
This is just a simple freefall 11 miles
from space back to Earth.

17:03.583 --> 17:04.583
Oh.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.709
I thought it was gonna be dangerous.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.291
When you enter the Earth's atmosphere

17:09.375 --> 17:11.959
and break the sound barrier,
you'll hear a big boom.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.250
Don't let it scare you.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.000
Milton, I'm afraid.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.500
Don't be.

17:17.709 --> 17:20.083
When you reach 5000 feet,
pull the rip cord,

17:20.166 --> 17:22.333
and the parachute will float you
safely back to Earth.

17:22.917 --> 17:25.500
<i>And I'll be in radio contact
with you the whole way.</i>

17:27.375 --> 17:28.375
Wasabi?

17:29.792 --> 17:30.834
Wasabi.

17:49.792 --> 17:50.667
<i>Jerry?</i>

17:50.750 --> 17:53.166
How you leave the ship
is going to determine your trajectory

17:53.250 --> 17:54.208
for the entire descent.

17:54.291 --> 17:55.917
<i>You've got to be smooth.</i>

17:56.000 --> 17:58.750
<i>Just lean forward
and let gravity do the work.</i>

18:00.125 --> 18:01.166
Got it.

18:02.291 --> 18:03.542
All right, here we go.

18:08.875 --> 18:09.875
Ooh.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.083
One...

18:16.750 --> 18:17.750
Whoo.

18:19.375 --> 18:20.417
Two...

18:24.208 --> 18:25.041
Three!

18:25.125 --> 18:26.000
Ow!

18:37.291 --> 18:39.375
Come on, kid! We're rooting for you!

18:41.333 --> 18:42.834
Did the boy jump yet?

18:45.083 --> 18:48.291
He's about to enter the atmosphere
and break the sound barrier.

18:54.125 --> 18:55.750
We lost radio communication.

18:55.834 --> 18:56.959
Where'd he go?

18:58.208 --> 18:59.500
Jerry, where are you?

19:00.375 --> 19:01.875
Oh, this isn't good.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.083
Come on, Jerry.

19:12.041 --> 19:13.208
Whoo!

19:15.583 --> 19:16.709
Oh, he's okay!

19:16.792 --> 19:18.333
- He's okay!
- All right!

19:19.709 --> 19:21.166
Yeah!

19:21.250 --> 19:22.959
All right, Jerry, look for landmarks.

19:23.041 --> 19:24.625
Do you see anything you recognize?

19:24.709 --> 19:27.625
Oh, oh, I can see
the school football field from here.

19:27.709 --> 19:28.875
Good. Aim for that.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.208
Recovery party, move out!

19:35.083 --> 19:36.875
Hey, where do you think
Jerry's gonna land?

19:36.959 --> 19:38.583
Well, if the jet stream gets hold of him,

19:38.667 --> 19:40.458
he could land in Mexico,

19:40.542 --> 19:42.500
Iceland, Florida.

19:44.375 --> 19:45.667
South America.

19:48.542 --> 19:49.750
New York.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.333
He's right behind you.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.917
Bingo hall. That was next on my list.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.125
Jerry!

19:55.959 --> 19:58.583
Dude, we're so glad to have you back.

19:58.667 --> 19:59.959
Jerry!

20:01.250 --> 20:02.333
Milton.

20:02.417 --> 20:05.000
Dude, I'm so sorry I went into space
instead of you.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.792
I'm just glad you're okay.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.959
Welcome back, Jerry.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.083
Of course, for me, it's bittersweet
because somewhere up in space...

20:13.333 --> 20:14.917
is my wife's little Wiggy!

20:15.583 --> 20:16.667
No, it's not, sir.

20:18.959 --> 20:20.417
I was jumping for two.

20:23.875 --> 20:25.250
You, my boy,

20:25.333 --> 20:27.583
have the right stuff to be an astronaut.

20:27.667 --> 20:28.917
Doesn't he, Colonel Wiggy?

20:30.583 --> 20:32.625
Hey, guys,
let's go to Phil's and celebrate.

20:32.709 --> 20:33.583
On me.

20:33.667 --> 20:34.625
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

20:34.709 --> 20:36.250
All right. Thanks, man.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.709
Jerry.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.375
There's another party for astronauts.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.625
It'd be great if you came, being a...

20:44.709 --> 20:46.250
...hero and everything.

20:46.333 --> 20:47.750
No thanks, Gunnar.

20:47.959 --> 20:50.208
I'm gonna go hang
out with my real friends.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.667
- Okay.
- Ahh.

20:53.166 --> 20:54.333
Hey, ladies.

20:54.375 --> 20:55.709
You know who this is?

20:55.792 --> 20:58.875
- World-famous astronaut Gunnar Nelson.
- Oh, hello.

20:58.959 --> 21:00.125
Thank you.

21:00.250 --> 21:01.792
- Oh, just--
-

21:04.000 --> 21:05.458
No, no, no!

21:05.542 --> 21:07.542
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

21:13.500 --> 21:15.875
Ohh! We're really proud of you, Jerry.

21:15.959 --> 21:17.000
Yeah, you should be.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.667
You know, the General says
I'm eligible for a purple heart.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.291
Wait, isn't that when you get injured
in the line of duty?

21:22.792 --> 21:24.333
Do you have any idea
what that cat did to me

21:24.417 --> 21:25.750
when we broke the sound barrier?

21:26.792 --> 21:27.750
Oh!

21:57.000 --> 21:57.959
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.041 --> 22:02.959
<i>Yes!</i>
