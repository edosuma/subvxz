00:01.147 --> 00:03.400
Please tell me we're not
giving an inch on this deal.

00:03.433 --> 00:04.700
It's your negotiation.

00:04.734 --> 00:06.068
It's your call.

00:06.102 --> 00:09.572
But take the emotion out of it.

00:09.606 --> 00:10.839
It's not personal.

00:10.874 --> 00:12.474
It's business.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.048
Oh.

00:22.752 --> 00:24.453
You just said, "Thanks for eating my dog

00:24.487 --> 00:25.821
in Shanghai this morning."

00:27.691 --> 00:29.174
Good night, Ryan.

00:29.209 --> 00:31.160
Good night, Michelle.

00:41.238 --> 00:42.671
Time to go home.

00:42.706 --> 00:44.546
I had an aisle seat

00:44.580 --> 00:47.409
and I was sitting next
to the most beautiful woman

00:47.444 --> 00:49.778
I had ever seen.
There was no ring, either.

00:49.813 --> 00:51.146
I couldn't believe it.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.482
Outta nowhere, this man walks up to me

00:53.516 --> 00:55.284
and asks to switch seats with me

00:55.318 --> 00:56.685
because his wife and kid are sitting

00:56.720 --> 00:58.120
in the aisle across from me.

00:58.154 --> 00:59.321
- You didn't.
- I did.

00:59.356 --> 01:01.690
I-I felt bad.

01:01.725 --> 01:04.226
What the hell?

01:04.260 --> 01:05.561
What are you doing, dumb-ass?

01:07.230 --> 01:09.965
Hey!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.667
No, no, no, no...

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

01:23.480 --> 01:25.714
But wait, wait, wait, wait.
Do you remember

01:25.749 --> 01:27.149
when we tied Eric's shoelaces together

01:27.183 --> 01:28.517
before we breached that apartment?

01:28.551 --> 01:31.720
Fool. What a fool.

01:31.755 --> 01:33.989
Man, ah,

01:34.024 --> 01:35.557
- I'm sorry, Juan.
- Oh!

01:35.592 --> 01:37.893
That's a game over, papi.

01:37.927 --> 01:40.095
- Pay up. A bet's a bet.
- Relax.

01:40.130 --> 01:42.185
No need to call the FBI.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.881
Okay, but seriously, how you doing?

01:46.503 --> 01:49.405
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

01:49.439 --> 01:50.572
For real.

01:50.607 --> 01:52.174
I mean, I'm still working
through some things,

01:52.208 --> 01:53.618
but...

01:55.879 --> 01:57.046
What?

01:57.080 --> 01:58.447
I gotta go,

01:58.481 --> 02:00.015
but if you need anything
or you wanna talk,

02:00.050 --> 02:01.939
you just call me, okay?

02:02.952 --> 02:04.053
I appreciate the offer.

02:04.087 --> 02:05.387
I don't like to bother you, man,

02:05.422 --> 02:07.022
now that you're a big fancy G-man.

02:07.057 --> 02:09.128
Shut up. I'm here for you.

02:09.658 --> 02:11.193
I'll see you soon.

02:15.865 --> 02:18.080
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

02:18.601 --> 02:21.136
Detective Steve Torino, Nassau County PD.

02:21.171 --> 02:22.271
I thought this was ours,

02:22.305 --> 02:24.073
but when I saw
the diplomatic plates, I, uh...

02:24.107 --> 02:26.108
You knew the pleasure was ours.

02:26.142 --> 02:27.176
Exactly.

02:27.210 --> 02:28.677
Now, here's the nickel tour of the scene.

02:28.712 --> 02:31.313
The vics are Ryan Parker...
he's the diplomat...

02:31.348 --> 02:33.449
and his driver, Scott Callum.

02:33.483 --> 02:35.084
What kind of diplomat?

02:35.118 --> 02:37.920
To China, whatever kind that is.

02:37.954 --> 02:39.922
I just did a ten-second search
on my phone.

02:39.956 --> 02:41.323
Any witnesses?

02:41.358 --> 02:43.759
Well, we're still canvassing.
Nothing so far.

02:43.793 --> 02:46.662
Best lead we got is someone
down the block heard gunfire

02:46.696 --> 02:48.697
and saw a white van driving away.

02:48.732 --> 02:50.332
No plate, but we got the make and model

02:50.367 --> 02:51.734
and we sent out a BOLO.

02:51.768 --> 02:54.002
Well, they clearly waited
for them to go up the driveway,

02:54.037 --> 02:56.705
maybe boxed him in.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.841
Hmm. Any souvenirs left behind?

02:58.875 --> 03:00.776
Negative. Shooter covered his ass.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.177
Scooped up the casings.

03:08.351 --> 03:11.587
Hey, look at the diplomat's right hand.

03:11.621 --> 03:13.222
He's got abrasions on his knuckles.

03:13.917 --> 03:15.457
Maybe there was an altercation.

03:15.492 --> 03:16.592
I don't think so.

03:16.626 --> 03:18.160
This looks like
a straight-up assassination.

03:18.194 --> 03:19.728
Okay, I'll toss the interior.

03:19.763 --> 03:20.963
- You take the trunk.
- Yeah.

03:28.638 --> 03:30.701
Well, the luggage is all here.

03:34.110 --> 03:35.782
Hey, OA.

03:37.313 --> 03:39.077
Look at this.

03:40.316 --> 03:43.081
There's paint that's hanging
off of the bumper,

03:43.787 --> 03:45.542
except paint doesn't hang.

03:46.752 --> 03:48.757
The spectrometry analysis
shows that the white paint

03:48.792 --> 03:50.659
is actually 90-micron vinyl

03:50.693 --> 03:52.027
with adhesive backing.

03:52.061 --> 03:54.496
Meaning the van was wrapped
in automotive contact paper

03:54.531 --> 03:56.598
- to mask its actual color.
- Right.

03:56.633 --> 03:59.301
All right, hey, B, let's update the BOLO.

03:59.335 --> 04:02.171
We're now looking for a van
that's anything but white.

04:02.205 --> 04:03.906
And we're also looking for one shooter.

04:03.940 --> 04:06.141
All the rounds came from
the same 9mm pistol.

04:06.176 --> 04:08.143
- Okay.
- So we've got one van,

04:08.178 --> 04:09.978
one shooter, two dead.

04:10.013 --> 04:11.847
What do we know about these two guys?

04:11.881 --> 04:13.982
Uh, well, we're still doing
our due diligence

04:14.017 --> 04:15.517
on the driver, but I think we can assume

04:15.552 --> 04:16.851
the primary target was the diplomat.

04:16.886 --> 04:18.587
I mean, someone shoots
at The Clash's tour bus,

04:18.620 --> 04:20.488
target's Joe Strummer, not the roadie.

04:20.523 --> 04:21.890
- Well...
- Don't. Don't.

04:21.925 --> 04:24.827
- Don't even start.
- And Ryan Parker?

04:24.861 --> 04:26.962
38. Unmarried. Worked
for Google for five years

04:26.996 --> 04:28.263
before joining the State Department.

04:28.298 --> 04:30.098
His parents live in Tacoma, Washington,

04:30.133 --> 04:32.267
and his only emergency contacts
in New York City

04:32.302 --> 04:33.669
are his coworkers.

04:33.703 --> 04:35.804
Yeah, well, let's talk
to them right away.

04:35.839 --> 04:37.172
I just got a call from the ADIC.

04:37.207 --> 04:39.741
As you can imagine, our friends
in DC are very anxious

04:39.776 --> 04:41.343
to have this case solved quickly.

04:41.377 --> 04:42.845
Yep.

04:42.879 --> 04:46.228
Ryan and I worked together for six years.

04:47.150 --> 04:49.318
We were very close.

04:49.352 --> 04:50.652
What was his official position

04:50.687 --> 04:51.854
with the State Department?

04:51.888 --> 04:55.070
Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Regional Trade.

04:55.736 --> 04:57.504
And you were with Ryan
all week in Shanghai?

04:57.538 --> 04:59.773
Yes, we flew back last night.

04:59.807 --> 05:02.075
We landed at JFK,
then went right to the party

05:02.109 --> 05:03.710
at the consulate.

05:03.744 --> 05:04.978
Why were you in China?

05:05.012 --> 05:07.347
Ryan was negotiating trade deals.

05:07.381 --> 05:09.334
Apple juice mostly.

05:09.717 --> 05:11.151
And I'm his translator.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.186
I'm sorry, apple juice?

05:13.220 --> 05:15.255
China's the world's number-one supplier

05:15.289 --> 05:16.790
of apple juice concentrate.

05:16.824 --> 05:19.092
We were discussing packaging guidelines

05:19.126 --> 05:22.529
to conform with new EPA guidelines.

05:22.563 --> 05:24.431
Anything unusual happen?

05:24.465 --> 05:27.167
No. It was pretty boring, actually.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.069
America and China have their issues,

05:29.103 --> 05:32.072
but apple juice isn't one of them.

05:32.106 --> 05:34.374
Ryan had fresh scrapes on his right hand.

05:34.408 --> 05:36.009
You know anything about that?

05:36.043 --> 05:38.545
- No.
- I do.

05:40.481 --> 05:42.415
Ryan told me about
an altercation he got into

05:42.450 --> 05:44.384
yesterday at JFK.

05:44.418 --> 05:45.552
What about?

05:45.586 --> 05:47.187
Luggage.

05:49.557 --> 05:53.059
I was able to pull this
from JFK security.

05:53.094 --> 05:54.327
And there's Ryan.

05:54.361 --> 05:56.496
Keep an eye on the guy
in a baseball cap to the right.

05:59.133 --> 06:00.934
Appears to be male, black,

06:00.968 --> 06:02.769
hat down low. He knows what he's doing.

06:02.803 --> 06:04.437
What, 5'10"?

06:04.472 --> 06:06.372
Yeah, and watch what he does next.

06:08.676 --> 06:11.646
He tries to steal Ryan's bag.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.380
So Ryan tries to stop him.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.549
"Excuse me, sir, I believe
you've taken my valise,"

06:16.584 --> 06:17.617
and whoosh!

06:17.651 --> 06:18.718
Out of nowhere, baseball cap guy

06:18.753 --> 06:20.353
takes a swing at him, misses.

06:20.387 --> 06:23.690
And bam, Ryan hits back.
Not a bad right cross.

06:23.724 --> 06:25.992
Yeah, especially for a diplomat.

06:26.026 --> 06:28.027
So the fight starts to draw attention.

06:28.062 --> 06:29.295
People try to break it up.

06:29.330 --> 06:31.291
Baseball cap guy runs off.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.702
Hey, check it out.

06:38.372 --> 06:40.273
Look who's standing nearby, watching.

06:40.307 --> 06:42.142
What? That's the translator, Michelle.

06:42.176 --> 06:44.244
She said she didn't know
anything about the fight.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.612
R - So either she's lost in thought,

06:45.646 --> 06:48.047
ruminating over the riveting
apple juice negotiations,

06:48.082 --> 06:49.516
or she's lying her ass off.

06:49.550 --> 06:50.717
All right, y'all, check this out.

06:50.751 --> 06:52.085
We have a new person of interest.

06:52.119 --> 06:54.053
Her name is Michelle Chang.
She's a Chinese interpreter.

06:54.088 --> 06:56.523
Most recently, she was working
with one of our DOAs,

06:56.557 --> 06:58.391
Ryan Parker. Let's pull her file

06:58.425 --> 06:59.993
and find out more about her, okay?

07:00.027 --> 07:01.628
Let's go check out Ryan's suitcase again.

07:01.662 --> 07:03.196
There's gotta be a reason why he wanted

07:03.230 --> 07:05.598
that particular bag.
Something's gotta be inside it.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.369
Something worth killing for.

07:07.968 --> 07:11.971
Shirts, pants, socks.

07:15.376 --> 07:16.492
A shaving kit.

07:16.527 --> 07:18.978
- It's all standard stuff.
- I don't get it.

07:19.013 --> 07:21.147
If the bag is so important,
then why didn't the shooter

07:21.182 --> 07:23.983
just take it out of the trunk after
he shot Ryan and the driver?

07:24.018 --> 07:25.351
Because then we would be entirely focused

07:25.386 --> 07:27.320
on finding the missing suitcase.

07:29.990 --> 07:33.328
He must have taken something
out from inside here.

07:35.029 --> 07:36.648
All right, check that out.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.900
Whoa. Hold up.

07:49.510 --> 07:50.788
There's a false bottom.

07:54.148 --> 07:55.748
It's empty.

07:55.783 --> 07:57.851
Okay, let's get someone
to take this to the lab,

07:57.885 --> 07:59.519
see if they can figure out
what was inside.

07:59.553 --> 08:01.154
Yeah.

08:03.891 --> 08:05.458
Michelle Chang is here.

08:08.229 --> 08:09.696
So you told us that you didn't even know

08:09.730 --> 08:11.264
that Ryan was in a fight,

08:11.298 --> 08:13.132
but that's you right there, watching.

08:13.167 --> 08:15.168
You're not even 30 feet away.

08:15.202 --> 08:16.769
I didn't see it.

08:16.804 --> 08:18.638
I was looking for my driver.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.808
Well, our forensics team did
a geometric reconstruction

08:21.842 --> 08:24.477
of your eyeline,
and based on their analysis,

08:24.511 --> 08:27.814
they believe there's a 97.94% chance

08:27.848 --> 08:29.749
that you were looking right at Ryan.

08:29.783 --> 08:32.552
More importantly, it's
a felony to lie to the FBI,

08:32.586 --> 08:35.288
so you might wanna reconsider
your answer.

08:38.359 --> 08:40.525
Why don't you tell us about the suitcase?

08:42.830 --> 08:44.998
I met a guy at a club last year.

08:46.634 --> 08:48.935
We started hanging out.

08:50.437 --> 08:52.972
He knew I was a translator
for a U.S. diplomat,

08:53.007 --> 08:57.710
so one night he asks
if I wanna make some...

08:57.745 --> 08:59.212
easy money.

08:59.246 --> 09:01.014
What did he want you to do?

09:01.048 --> 09:03.526
Give Ryan a duplicate suitcase.

09:04.084 --> 09:06.252
One with a secret compartment.

09:06.287 --> 09:07.987
Each time we flew back to New York,

09:08.022 --> 09:10.241
I'd slip a package inside.

09:11.025 --> 09:13.092
Said it was for his Nigerian friend

09:13.127 --> 09:14.661
who worked at the airport.

09:14.695 --> 09:16.262
What was in that package?

09:16.297 --> 09:17.897
I don't know. I never looked.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.918
How many times did you do this?

09:20.834 --> 09:22.241
Five.

09:25.906 --> 09:27.634
Your Chinese friend...
did he have a name?

09:29.009 --> 09:31.044
All right, people, the man
Michelle was working with

09:31.078 --> 09:33.212
is a Chinese national named Wang Li.

09:33.247 --> 09:35.014
Odds of this being real seem remote,

09:35.049 --> 09:36.783
but let's run it down anyway,

09:36.817 --> 09:38.151
and yes, I know Wang Li

09:38.185 --> 09:40.186
is the Chinese equivalent of John Smith.

09:40.220 --> 09:41.587
Have we heard from the lab?

09:41.622 --> 09:43.856
Uh, yeah, no forensics
in the car or on the body.

09:43.891 --> 09:45.959
- Suitcase?
- Still working on it.

09:45.993 --> 09:48.294
Stay on it. We need to find that van.

09:48.329 --> 09:51.464
I want all available analysts
looking at traffic cams 24/7.

09:51.498 --> 09:53.232
Yep. Oh, you wanna...

09:53.267 --> 09:57.670
Um, I think I may have found
the Nigerian friend at JFK.

09:57.705 --> 10:00.273
I did a rundown on
all Air China baggage handlers

10:00.307 --> 10:01.708
that were scheduled to work yesterday,

10:01.742 --> 10:03.810
and all of them showed up,
except for one.

10:03.844 --> 10:05.111
His name is Kevin Okoro.

10:05.145 --> 10:07.480
He was T-boned on his way
to work by a City Tour Bus.

10:07.514 --> 10:08.715
Is he okay?

10:08.749 --> 10:09.816
He's in a medically-induced coma,

10:09.850 --> 10:11.784
but the doctors think he'll survive.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.519
What do we know about Okoro?

10:13.554 --> 10:15.955
Not much. He's 31. No priors.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.390
He went to Nassau Community College

10:17.424 --> 10:19.659
and he's got a really great credit score.

10:19.693 --> 10:20.793
758.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.862
Okay, so if the inside man is Nigerian,

10:22.896 --> 10:24.397
we have to assume the boss is too.

10:24.431 --> 10:25.665
I want you to call the OC,

10:25.699 --> 10:27.567
ask if there are
any Nigerian street gangs

10:27.601 --> 10:29.302
operating in Brooklyn, Queens...

10:29.336 --> 10:31.337
There is one. Uh, the White Horses.

10:31.372 --> 10:32.939
They run drugs out of Flatbush.

10:32.973 --> 10:34.868
You have any sources you can talk to?

10:35.943 --> 10:37.777
Yeah, I have a... friend

10:37.811 --> 10:38.911
that lives in that part of town.

10:38.946 --> 10:40.242
Great.

10:48.396 --> 10:49.600
Mo!

10:51.856 --> 10:53.803
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

10:55.429 --> 10:57.382
- Good to see you, man.
- Yeah, you too.

10:57.382 --> 10:58.816
What's up?

10:58.850 --> 11:00.117
Uh...

11:00.151 --> 11:01.685
Well...

11:01.720 --> 11:02.753
You okay?

11:02.787 --> 11:04.288
Yeah. Yeah, no.

11:04.322 --> 11:05.723
No, I'm good. How are you?

11:05.757 --> 11:07.124
You solid?

11:07.158 --> 11:09.093
You asking as my sponsor or my friend?

11:09.127 --> 11:10.216
Uh, well, both,

11:10.251 --> 11:11.328
but if you're gonna make me choose,

11:11.363 --> 11:12.496
your sponsor, I guess.

11:14.065 --> 11:16.667
I'm doing great, man. Yeah.

11:16.701 --> 11:19.937
Good. I'm proud of you.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.740
- 724 days sober, bro.
- Yep.

11:22.774 --> 11:24.508
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have made it, like,

11:24.542 --> 11:26.243
724 minutes.

11:26.278 --> 11:28.312
Stop it. It's all you.

11:28.346 --> 11:30.948
So what's up?

11:30.982 --> 11:32.650
Yeah.

11:32.684 --> 11:34.084
So I know

11:34.119 --> 11:36.520
we said to keep our jobs
and our lives separate,

11:36.554 --> 11:38.322
so I-I hesitate to even ask.

11:38.356 --> 11:39.523
And yet, you've come

11:39.557 --> 11:41.058
all the way down here to my apartment,

11:41.092 --> 11:42.826
so I'm guessing it's important.

11:42.861 --> 11:44.479
It is.

11:44.963 --> 11:46.981
Then I'm happy to help.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.432
Great.

11:50.068 --> 11:51.945
Do you know this guy?

11:52.904 --> 11:56.157
What, all Nigerians know each other?

11:57.208 --> 11:58.876
I'm just...

11:58.910 --> 12:00.544
I'm just playing, man.

12:00.578 --> 12:02.446
Just playing.

12:04.049 --> 12:07.484
Yeah, I, uh... I know him.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.520
Yeah?

12:09.554 --> 12:11.256
His name is Okoro.

12:12.257 --> 12:14.358
I think he works at JFK.

12:14.392 --> 12:16.026
He does.

12:16.061 --> 12:18.729
Does he, uh, work for anyone else

12:18.763 --> 12:20.898
when he's not working at JFK?

12:22.834 --> 12:24.269
Yes.

12:25.562 --> 12:27.146
The White Horses.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.107
H-he got involved with them
a few years back

12:30.141 --> 12:34.111
when I was still in the...
in the drug game.

12:35.747 --> 12:37.247
That's all I need to know.

12:37.282 --> 12:38.700
Thanks for your help.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.218
You're gonna make me look good
to my bosses.

12:41.252 --> 12:42.519
I got you, man.

12:44.322 --> 12:46.290
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

12:46.324 --> 12:47.891
That was Jubal. His friend just confirmed

12:47.926 --> 12:50.628
that Mr. Okoro is affiliated
with the White Horses.

12:51.262 --> 12:52.496
Excuse me.

12:53.498 --> 12:55.599
We'd like to speak
to one of your patients,

12:55.633 --> 12:56.700
Kevin Okoro.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.971
He died. An hour ago.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.606
W... from his injuries?

13:02.640 --> 13:03.807
Can I help you guys?

13:03.842 --> 13:06.043
Yeah, we came in here
to check on Kevin Okoro.

13:06.077 --> 13:08.178
- We just heard he passed.
- Yeah.

13:08.213 --> 13:10.247
Somebody suffocated him.

13:16.211 --> 13:17.613
All right, listen up, Yankee fans.

13:17.638 --> 13:19.525
Another case just landed on the docket.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.250
Victim's name is Kevin Okoro.

13:21.285 --> 13:23.987
He was pronounced dead
at St. Ann's this afternoon

13:24.021 --> 13:25.421
at 2:04 p.m.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.457
NYPD believes he was suffocated.

13:27.491 --> 13:30.660
Silver lining is Mr. Okoro
played for the White Horses.

13:30.694 --> 13:33.229
Only evidence is a nurse saw a black male

13:33.263 --> 13:35.832
leaving Okoro's room shortly
before he was found dead,

13:35.866 --> 13:37.867
and there, of course,
no video of the crime,

13:37.901 --> 13:40.203
since camera's aren't allowed
in the patients' rooms,

13:40.237 --> 13:42.305
so that means
we will have to get creative.

13:42.339 --> 13:44.307
So let's activate
the right side of our brains

13:44.341 --> 13:46.642
and get to work. That is all.

13:46.677 --> 13:47.910
Thing about these White Horses...

13:47.945 --> 13:49.479
- Hmm?
- They sure play hardball.

13:49.513 --> 13:50.947
Yeah, they must've caught wind

13:50.981 --> 13:52.248
that we were investigating,

13:52.282 --> 13:54.951
so they take out Okoro
to tie off the homicide case.

13:54.985 --> 13:57.587
Mm. But I mean, what is this about?

13:57.621 --> 14:00.256
Is it about cocaine? Is it about heroin?

14:00.290 --> 14:01.624
No, it's worse.

14:01.658 --> 14:03.726
Lab results just came back
on the suitcase.

14:03.761 --> 14:05.161
Found traces of carfentanil.

14:05.195 --> 14:07.563
100 times more toxic than fentanyl,

14:07.598 --> 14:09.932
10,000 times more toxic than morphine.

14:09.967 --> 14:12.268
China is a major supplier.

14:12.302 --> 14:14.237
Based on the dimensions
of the hidden compartment

14:14.271 --> 14:15.638
in Ryan Parker's luggage,

14:15.672 --> 14:18.708
we're looking at a street value
of over $10 million.

14:18.742 --> 14:20.276
Whoa.

14:20.310 --> 14:21.844
They also found residue...

14:21.879 --> 14:23.546
Of pure fentanyl in the bag as well.

14:23.580 --> 14:25.715
I'm guessing that's
what Michelle was sneaking

14:25.749 --> 14:28.017
into Ryan's suitcase
for the first few trips

14:28.052 --> 14:30.753
before they upgraded
to the more potent stuff.

14:30.788 --> 14:32.722
Hey, we just got a hit on the BOLO.

14:32.756 --> 14:34.390
NYPD found an abandoned van...

14:34.425 --> 14:36.893
same make, same model
of the van from the shooting.

14:36.927 --> 14:38.361
Dent on the front bumper, too.

14:38.395 --> 14:40.979
- Call Maggie and OA for me.
- Right away.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.334
What's up?

14:45.369 --> 14:46.602
My buddy, Juan.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.538
We did a tour in Iraq together.
I told you about him.

14:48.572 --> 14:49.806
- Yeah, yeah.
- He's struggling.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.174
Seems a little lost.

14:51.208 --> 14:52.241
What, drugs?

14:52.276 --> 14:53.609
He's definitely partying too much.

14:53.644 --> 14:57.046
He just needs a new job, find some focus.

14:57.081 --> 14:58.714
Maybe you should talk to Jubal.

14:58.749 --> 15:00.083
No, he's not an addict.

15:00.117 --> 15:03.678
He's just having trouble
adjusting to the real world.

15:04.188 --> 15:05.305
Hmm.

15:06.423 --> 15:07.598
What?

15:08.292 --> 15:10.059
Nothing. Look, if it were me,

15:10.094 --> 15:11.811
I would talk to Jubal.

15:14.064 --> 15:16.165
- Hey.
- Bar owner across the street

15:16.200 --> 15:18.334
called it in yesterday.

15:22.706 --> 15:24.707
Yeah, there we go.

15:24.741 --> 15:26.509
The van was definitely wrapped in vinyl.

15:26.543 --> 15:28.177
There's pieces left here on the bottom.

15:28.212 --> 15:29.779
I mean, come on.

15:29.813 --> 15:31.314
You're gonna be a criminal,
at least be all-in.

15:31.348 --> 15:32.315
You know what I mean?

15:32.349 --> 15:34.083
Like, pay attention to the details.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.452
This is Agent Zidan.
Need an ERT down here

15:36.487 --> 15:38.287
to do a sweep of this abandoned van...

15:38.322 --> 15:39.355
prints, DNA.

15:39.389 --> 15:40.756
Bar owner say anything else to you?

15:41.649 --> 15:43.526
He saw a black guy parking his van here,

15:43.560 --> 15:44.961
told him the spot was reserved.

15:44.995 --> 15:46.062
Black guy flipped him off.

15:46.096 --> 15:47.697
They got into it for a few minutes,

15:47.731 --> 15:49.699
then he ran off
and jumped into a yellow cab.

15:49.733 --> 15:50.900
The cab was waiting for him?

15:50.934 --> 15:52.168
He was driving it.

15:53.537 --> 15:54.904
What time was this?

15:54.938 --> 15:56.372
Around 2:00 a.m.

15:57.508 --> 15:59.475
Okay. Thanks.

16:01.845 --> 16:02.979
Can you drop me off at the subway?

16:03.013 --> 16:05.148
I just got another text.
I gotta check on Juan.

16:05.182 --> 16:07.325
Uh, yeah.

16:11.955 --> 16:15.057
I'm sorry to bring you into all this,

16:15.092 --> 16:16.792
but I'm just in a jam.

16:16.827 --> 16:19.128
My mom's cancer kicked up again.

16:19.163 --> 16:20.746
Oh.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.169
Um, I'm sorry to hear that...

16:26.203 --> 16:28.404
She's okay, for now,

16:28.438 --> 16:29.972
but she needs medicine.

16:30.007 --> 16:31.674
Some sort of new chemo pill,

16:31.708 --> 16:34.110
but her insurance got canceled
three months ago

16:34.144 --> 16:36.812
'cause she got sick.
She had to stop working.

16:36.847 --> 16:38.281
How can I help?

16:38.315 --> 16:40.650
I hate to ask you again, but...

16:40.684 --> 16:43.069
It's okay. Just name a number.

16:45.022 --> 16:48.891
- Two grand?
- Yeah. You got it.

16:48.926 --> 16:53.462
You're a good friend, Omar.

16:58.235 --> 17:00.102
- Hey.
- Ah, hey.

17:00.137 --> 17:02.638
So I've been trying to pull video footage

17:02.673 --> 17:05.040
of any yellow cabs near the
location of the stolen van

17:05.075 --> 17:07.376
around 2:00 a.m., but I struck out.

17:07.411 --> 17:08.711
There are no cameras in the area,

17:08.744 --> 17:12.147
so I shifted gears
and I looked for yellow cabs

17:12.182 --> 17:15.560
near St. Ann's around the time
Okoro was suffocated.

17:16.819 --> 17:18.146
Found this.

17:19.856 --> 17:21.991
Yeah, all right.

17:23.827 --> 17:25.261
Can't really make out his face.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.863
No, but I got a really good
look at his license plate.

17:27.897 --> 17:29.065
- Oh, great.
- Oh, good.

17:33.537 --> 17:36.906
- His name is...
- Morris Kalu.

17:38.108 --> 17:41.577
That's my... my friend.

17:50.158 --> 17:53.255
It doesn't make any sense.
Morris is a good man.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.048
He's had his issues,
but he's worked very hard

17:56.083 --> 17:58.686
to do better, to... to move forward.

17:59.153 --> 18:01.621
How exactly do you know this man?

18:01.655 --> 18:04.290
I'm his sponsor. He's an addict.

18:04.324 --> 18:05.658
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:05.692 --> 18:07.026
I didn't know that.

18:07.060 --> 18:08.327
Ah, it's okay. He's very open

18:08.362 --> 18:09.780
about his recovery.

18:13.634 --> 18:17.270
Was Morris ever part
of this gang, the White Horses?

18:17.304 --> 18:19.238
Yeah, yes. When he was younger,

18:19.273 --> 18:22.742
he sold dope on the streets
for a few years.

18:22.776 --> 18:24.977
Then he got addicted
and he started stealing,

18:25.012 --> 18:27.513
did some time. I met him at a meeting

18:27.548 --> 18:28.648
two years ago.

18:28.682 --> 18:29.967
He was...

18:30.951 --> 18:32.385
remorseful. He was honest.

18:32.419 --> 18:33.929
We started talking.

18:34.688 --> 18:37.023
Well, I became his sponsor, so...

18:37.057 --> 18:38.958
Is it possible he started dealing again

18:38.992 --> 18:40.602
for the White Horses?

18:42.563 --> 18:43.596
Maybe...

18:46.400 --> 18:47.833
But I doubt it.

18:47.868 --> 18:50.336
I'm... I see him pretty regularly,

18:50.370 --> 18:52.038
and, uh, there's no evidence

18:52.072 --> 18:54.575
of any kind of illegal activity.

18:55.142 --> 18:57.119
But if there was,

18:59.012 --> 19:00.664
If there was,

19:02.516 --> 19:04.417
then I screwed up.

19:07.988 --> 19:09.956
I'll talk to him.

19:09.990 --> 19:12.176
You'll talk to him as a suspect.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.461
Yeah. Oh, yeah, as a suspect.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.071
Right here is fine.

19:25.105 --> 19:26.272
Yo, what's up?

19:26.306 --> 19:27.473
You look upset.

19:27.507 --> 19:29.041
I need to ask you some questions,

19:29.076 --> 19:30.576
and just so we're clear,

19:30.611 --> 19:33.739
I'm asking you as an FBI agent,
not your sponsor.

19:34.448 --> 19:35.448
Oh, okay.

19:35.482 --> 19:37.116
Okay.

19:37.150 --> 19:38.744
So...

19:40.354 --> 19:42.414
Are you carrying a gun?

19:43.590 --> 19:45.157
I'm a cab driver in New York City.

19:45.192 --> 19:47.593
- What you expect?
- And you got a license for it.

19:47.628 --> 19:50.296
No. I-I... no.

19:50.330 --> 19:52.331
Really, Mo?

19:52.366 --> 19:53.699
What are you thinking, man?

19:56.837 --> 19:58.680
A nine-mil?

19:59.706 --> 20:01.307
You're carrying a nine-mil.

20:01.341 --> 20:02.541
Yo, man, what are you...

20:02.576 --> 20:03.943
I need... I need to take you in

20:03.977 --> 20:05.111
and ask you some more questions.

20:05.145 --> 20:06.779
What I need you to do is turn around,

20:06.813 --> 20:07.913
put your hands behind your back.

20:07.948 --> 20:09.515
- Yo, what are you talking...
- Mo.

20:11.885 --> 20:13.052
Please.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.962
Are you serious right now?

20:22.996 --> 20:24.639
Sorry, man.

20:36.209 --> 20:37.743
Look, Morris,

20:37.778 --> 20:40.112
if you're using again and you
got caught up in something,

20:40.147 --> 20:42.114
just lay it out for me
and I'll do what I can.

20:42.149 --> 20:44.216
I'm not using.

20:44.251 --> 20:45.686
Okay, good.

20:46.953 --> 20:50.289
I need to tell me where you were
two nights ago at 11:00 p.m.

20:50.324 --> 20:52.892
W-what's going on, man?

20:52.926 --> 20:54.460
What do you think I've done?

20:54.494 --> 20:56.228
I'm gonna cut through all the cop crap.

20:56.263 --> 20:57.363
I'm gonna come at you straight,

20:57.397 --> 20:59.031
and I appreciate you doing the same.

21:02.569 --> 21:05.705
Are you working
for the White Horses again?

21:05.739 --> 21:07.373
Are the involved
in the smuggling operation,

21:07.407 --> 21:10.242
- the murders?
- What are you talking about?

21:12.212 --> 21:13.312
We have video

21:13.347 --> 21:16.008
of someone who looks like you

21:17.351 --> 21:18.684
near St. Ann's hospital

21:18.719 --> 21:20.653
minutes after Okoro was killed.

21:20.687 --> 21:23.255
O-Okoro? St. Ann's?

21:23.290 --> 21:24.323
Yeah.

21:24.358 --> 21:27.019
I haven't been
in that part of town in months.

21:28.695 --> 21:30.930
Okay.

21:34.768 --> 21:36.278
Is that your cab?

21:37.003 --> 21:38.270
Yeah.

21:38.305 --> 21:40.973
That's mine, and I worked my ass off

21:41.007 --> 21:42.274
to buy that cab, too, but I did it...

21:42.309 --> 21:44.877
by working hard, not by moving drugs.

21:44.911 --> 21:48.314
Are you positive? Did you look
at the license plate number?

21:51.017 --> 21:52.418
Yes, I'm positive!

21:52.452 --> 21:54.954
Then where were you
two nights ago at 11:00 p.m.?

21:54.988 --> 21:56.155
At home.

21:56.189 --> 21:57.990
Can anyone verify that?

21:58.024 --> 21:59.592
No. I was alone,

21:59.626 --> 22:01.394
and why do you keep asking
about two nights ago?

22:01.428 --> 22:03.462
Two men were killed...

22:03.497 --> 22:04.964
a diplomat and his driver...

22:04.998 --> 22:06.966
and they were shot with nine-millimeters,

22:07.000 --> 22:08.300
and there is evidence to suggest

22:08.335 --> 22:12.104
the killer was using
a yellow cab, and this...

22:15.375 --> 22:17.009
Is you,

22:17.043 --> 22:20.012
a block from St. Ann's,
getting into your cab.

22:22.749 --> 22:25.117
No, no. That... that's not me.

22:26.586 --> 22:28.854
That's my cab, but that's not me, okay?

22:28.889 --> 22:29.989
What do you mean?

22:30.023 --> 22:32.525
No, that... that's the guy
I rent to sometimes.

22:34.694 --> 22:37.430
Uh, does this guy have a name?

22:37.464 --> 22:39.098
Trevor Jabari.

22:39.132 --> 22:40.800
Trevor Jabari?

22:40.834 --> 22:43.235
That's the man
who's getting into your cab?

22:43.270 --> 22:46.539
Yes. I rent to him five times a month.

22:48.275 --> 22:49.575
See, he writes me a check.

22:49.609 --> 22:51.744
I-I-I can... I can show you.

22:54.614 --> 22:56.348
Okay, good.

22:58.852 --> 23:00.252
I believe you.

23:03.089 --> 23:06.058
Trevor Jabari, known member
of the White Horses

23:06.092 --> 23:07.960
and part-time New York cab driver,

23:07.994 --> 23:09.395
is now our prime suspect.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.163
We believe he was the man driving the van

23:11.198 --> 23:12.598
the night of the two murders

23:12.632 --> 23:15.901
and the man exiting the hospital
shortly after Okoro's death.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.169
That's three kills, people.

23:17.204 --> 23:18.768
Puts him in the Murderer Hall of Fame.

23:18.803 --> 23:21.490
- Look into that.
- Let's find this pond scum, and fast.

23:21.524 --> 23:22.641
- Hey.
- Yeah.

23:22.676 --> 23:24.076
So we checked Jabari's last known.

23:24.110 --> 23:25.945
His landlord says
he hasn't been there in months.

23:25.979 --> 23:27.947
Okay. What about his financials?

23:27.981 --> 23:29.715
Well, he's been making ATM withdrawals

23:29.749 --> 23:32.751
over the last couple of months at a
place called Platinum Media, LLC,

23:32.786 --> 23:34.420
doing business as "Nirvana,"

23:34.454 --> 23:36.088
which is a nightclub in Brooklyn.

23:36.122 --> 23:38.090
And here's why Jabari
was here all the time.

23:38.124 --> 23:39.558
I found social media photos of him

23:39.593 --> 23:41.627
and a woman named Chantelle King.

23:41.661 --> 23:43.596
Single mom, five-year-old daughter,

23:43.630 --> 23:44.797
and a cocktail waitress at Nirvana.

23:44.831 --> 23:46.065
Yeah, quick, call Maggie and OA.

23:46.099 --> 23:47.666
- Get 'em over there now.
- Copy that.

23:47.701 --> 23:49.036
Thanks.

23:51.338 --> 23:52.905
Trevor Jabari?

23:52.939 --> 23:54.773
Don't know no one by that name.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.942
That's a bad answer, Chantelle.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.445
We know that you have a young daughter,

23:59.479 --> 24:02.081
so I'm assuming
you don't want to go to prison.

24:04.885 --> 24:06.552
Okay, I know Trevor.

24:06.586 --> 24:08.220
We... hang out sometimes.

24:08.255 --> 24:09.421
Why? What's up?

24:09.456 --> 24:11.690
We need to know
where he's staying these days.

24:11.725 --> 24:13.259
Don't know.

24:15.128 --> 24:17.162
- Hey.
- Hey, it's me.

24:17.197 --> 24:19.098
I just ran Jabari's financials.

24:19.132 --> 24:21.333
He made a $300 withdrawal at Nirvana

24:21.368 --> 24:23.335
ten seconds ago. He's there.

24:23.370 --> 24:25.070
Send backup right away.

24:25.105 --> 24:26.739
Copy that.

24:26.773 --> 24:28.240
Wow, Chantelle.

24:28.275 --> 24:29.808
You're a really bad listener.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.444
- What are you talking about?
- We know that he's here.

24:32.479 --> 24:34.780
Why don't you take us to him right now?

24:40.387 --> 24:42.821
He's in the VIP room.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.490
Well, why don't you show us
where that is?

24:56.036 --> 24:57.670
Maroon shirt, black jacket.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.017
On the couch.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.662
Trevor.

25:14.454 --> 25:15.387
FBI.

25:15.422 --> 25:16.855
Don't move! Don't... move.

25:18.325 --> 25:19.625
Move!

25:22.195 --> 25:24.997
- Hey!
- I'm splitting!

25:35.342 --> 25:38.077
Stop resisting!

25:38.111 --> 25:40.045
Oh, he's got a gun.

25:45.785 --> 25:47.019
Hey!

25:47.053 --> 25:48.153
Drop the weapon!

26:05.375 --> 26:07.341
We're sorry about your friend.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.344
It was self-defense. He didn't g...

26:09.379 --> 26:12.214
Which one of you shot him?

26:12.248 --> 26:15.724
That... that's not relevant
to the conversation.

26:18.154 --> 26:19.321
But like my partner said,

26:19.355 --> 26:22.064
we really are sorry for your loss.

26:23.493 --> 26:25.427
So it was you.

26:28.431 --> 26:30.197
All right, look, Chantelle,

26:31.167 --> 26:33.702
either you're gonna tell us
everything you know

26:33.736 --> 26:36.829
about Jabari's drug operation...

26:37.140 --> 26:40.874
who he worked for, where he hung out...

26:42.245 --> 26:44.713
or we're gonna charge you
with felony obstruction.

26:54.724 --> 26:56.598
What do you want to know?

26:57.460 --> 26:59.428
For starters...

27:01.531 --> 27:03.031
You good?

27:03.066 --> 27:04.666
I gotta go.

27:11.574 --> 27:13.175
Hey.

27:13.209 --> 27:14.776
What the hell's going on?

27:14.811 --> 27:17.279
Christina found him
on the floor, unconscious.

27:17.313 --> 27:19.047
Unconscious? What, like he passed out?

27:19.082 --> 27:21.206
No. He OD'd.

27:22.452 --> 27:24.386
He OD'd?

27:24.420 --> 27:27.689
On what? Coke?

27:27.724 --> 27:31.226
No, this new crap. Carfentanil.

27:36.599 --> 27:37.966
Is he gonna make it?

27:38.001 --> 27:39.501
Don't know.

27:39.535 --> 27:40.869
Doctors say they're doing their best.

27:40.903 --> 27:44.306
I was... I was just with him.

27:44.340 --> 27:46.141
He asked me for some cash.

27:46.175 --> 27:49.067
He said his mom needed
to buy some medicine, so...

27:50.380 --> 27:52.714
I gave him $2,000.

27:52.749 --> 27:54.716
He was playing you, Omar.

28:00.089 --> 28:01.925
He's an addict.

28:04.894 --> 28:06.361
I just talked to ballistics.

28:06.396 --> 28:08.663
The gun you found on Jabari
is the same weapon

28:08.698 --> 28:10.432
used to kill Ryan Parker and his driver.

28:10.466 --> 28:12.000
Great. Looks like we got our man.

28:12.035 --> 28:14.636
Uh, we got the shooter.
I'm not so sure about the man.

28:14.670 --> 28:15.971
From what Chantelle told us,

28:16.005 --> 28:18.273
Jabari was taking his orders
from this guy named Tayo.

28:18.307 --> 28:20.475
He's the one who calls all the shots

28:20.510 --> 28:22.144
and is overseeing
the entire drug operation

28:22.178 --> 28:23.245
from top to bottom.

28:23.279 --> 28:25.213
Well, his drugs are starting
to wreak havoc.

28:25.248 --> 28:27.883
In the past 24 hours, there
have been nine fatal overdoses,

28:27.917 --> 28:31.520
all of them related
to this carfentanil crap.

28:31.554 --> 28:33.255
We need to find this stuff fast.

28:33.289 --> 28:35.385
Yeah, well, the good news is
we know where it is.

28:35.419 --> 28:37.292
According to Chantelle,
Tayo's sitting on the drugs

28:37.326 --> 28:38.794
at a warehouse on Frederick Street.

28:38.828 --> 28:41.029
- Let's hit it now.
- Based on what?

28:41.064 --> 28:42.964
We don't have enough evidence
to get a warrant.

28:42.999 --> 28:45.901
So let's go back to your friend
Morris and put him in play.

28:45.935 --> 28:48.336
Uh, no. He hasn't been
in the gang for years.

28:48.371 --> 28:50.639
There's no way he'd be interested
in something like that.

28:50.673 --> 28:53.275
Interesting? I wasn't planning
on sending an invitation.

28:53.309 --> 28:54.910
We popped him for carrying
an unlicensed firearm.

28:54.944 --> 28:56.111
That's three years, minimum.

28:56.145 --> 28:57.546
Okay, well, I'm not gonna jam him up

28:57.580 --> 29:00.749
over the gun, all right?
We'll find another way.

29:00.783 --> 29:02.751
With all due respect,

29:02.785 --> 29:04.086
that's not our problem.

29:07.557 --> 29:09.024
I'm just telling you like it is, Jubal.

29:09.058 --> 29:11.626
We catch a guy dirty, he has a choice.

29:11.661 --> 29:13.428
He either cooperates or he does time.

29:13.463 --> 29:14.863
That's how we do business.

29:14.897 --> 29:17.699
That's how we get bad guys
off the street.

29:17.733 --> 29:20.492
And I appreciate the lesson. Thanks.

29:21.671 --> 29:23.138
Am I wrong?

29:23.172 --> 29:25.607
Delivery's a little harsh,

29:25.641 --> 29:27.309
but no, you're not wrong.

29:27.343 --> 29:29.144
Morris is the only way
into that community.

29:29.178 --> 29:31.246
He knows the players and the streets.

29:37.086 --> 29:38.954
Jubal, we just need
one more piece of evidence

29:38.988 --> 29:41.523
tying Tayo to the smuggling
and the homicides.

29:41.557 --> 29:44.559
Then we can get a warrant
and we'll take that route.

29:47.463 --> 29:49.164
I get it. I get it.

29:49.198 --> 29:51.500
I think we can find another way.

29:51.534 --> 29:53.702
My relationship with Morris
is complicated.

29:53.736 --> 29:55.303
I've got a duty to look out for him.

29:55.338 --> 29:57.939
You also have a duty to
protect the people of this city

29:57.974 --> 30:00.175
and get these lethal drugs
off the street,

30:00.209 --> 30:02.043
and to arrest the man who ordered

30:02.078 --> 30:03.879
these three murders.

30:03.913 --> 30:06.381
Right now, Morris is an asset.

30:06.415 --> 30:08.083
He can't be ignored.

30:15.024 --> 30:16.925
Okay, I'll talk to him.

30:23.866 --> 30:25.634
You... you want me to wear a wire

30:25.668 --> 30:27.035
a-and talk to Tayo?

30:27.069 --> 30:29.838
I know it's a big ask,

30:29.872 --> 30:32.674
but, uh, the truth is

30:32.708 --> 30:35.677
that the other alternative
is a lot worse.

30:35.711 --> 30:37.078
Excuse me?

30:37.113 --> 30:38.313
The gun that we found...

30:38.347 --> 30:40.782
W-wait, you're gonna
jam me up over that gun?

30:43.286 --> 30:45.187
- For real?
- I'm sorry, Mo.

30:45.221 --> 30:46.821
I'm... I'm... I'm just being honest.

30:46.856 --> 30:50.458
You can work with us, and you'll
get a pass on the gun, or... or...

30:50.493 --> 30:53.228
you're gonna be charged with
possession of an unlicensed handgun,

30:53.262 --> 30:55.197
and you're probably
gonna serve some time.

30:55.231 --> 30:56.731
- Wait...
- I will support you

30:56.766 --> 30:58.667
no matter what you decide,
but in my opinion,

30:58.701 --> 31:01.236
staying out of prison
is the better choice here.

31:01.270 --> 31:02.871
I'm not sure about that.

31:02.905 --> 31:07.576
Well, it's real hard
to stay sober in prison.

31:07.610 --> 31:09.945
It's not a great support system.

31:09.979 --> 31:12.080
Yeah, well, my support system
on the outside

31:12.114 --> 31:13.782
not so great, either.

31:19.188 --> 31:20.779
You're right,

31:22.858 --> 31:25.033
but we are where we are,

31:26.229 --> 31:28.496
and there's nothing I can do about it.

31:34.637 --> 31:36.905
- You hear me?
- Loud and clear.

31:38.274 --> 31:39.674
Okay, Jubal, we're good to go.

31:39.709 --> 31:42.844
Got live audio and video.

31:42.878 --> 31:44.446
Copy that.

31:46.716 --> 31:49.651
Just do your thing. We're right
outside if things go bad.

31:49.685 --> 31:51.353
We'll come pull you out.
Just say the word.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.054
I know. Easter.

32:16.512 --> 32:18.346
Let's do this.

32:22.885 --> 32:24.653
What you need?

32:24.687 --> 32:26.855
Uh, l-looking for Tayo.

32:26.889 --> 32:29.473
Tell him Morris has something
important to tell him.

32:30.660 --> 32:32.827
Why don't you tell me
what he needs to know?

32:32.862 --> 32:35.979
Uh, it's sensitive. For his ears only.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.633
Take a walk, bro. I ain't
got time for your games.

32:38.668 --> 32:41.403
We will be there in 30 seconds
if things start to go south.

32:41.437 --> 32:42.570
- Yeah.
- You want to be

32:42.605 --> 32:44.039
the go-between?
That... that's cool with me.

32:44.073 --> 32:45.540
He's gonna do fine. He knows the game.

32:45.574 --> 32:48.043
I'm not so sure about that.
He's a different guy now.

32:48.077 --> 32:49.544
He sees things differently.

32:49.578 --> 32:50.879
Doesn't mean he can't fake it,

32:50.913 --> 32:52.280
persuade Tayo to start talking.

32:52.315 --> 32:54.149
Just tell him I got some information.

32:54.183 --> 32:57.152
The FBI's been asking
about him and Jabari.

32:57.186 --> 33:00.889
But trust me, Tayo knows me
from back in the day.

33:15.571 --> 33:17.979
Dude named Morris is here.

33:18.474 --> 33:20.909
Says he's been talking to the FBI.

33:41.263 --> 33:42.797
- Okay, he's in.
- Yeah.

33:42.832 --> 33:45.734
Now the only visual we have
is the body cam.

33:48.804 --> 33:49.938
You know what? Give me the keys.

33:49.972 --> 33:51.673
- Wait, what?
- Why? What are you doing?

33:51.707 --> 33:53.074
I want to move the van closer.

33:53.109 --> 33:54.709
No, we cannot risk moving.

33:54.744 --> 33:57.011
Hey, last time I checked, I'm in charge.

34:01.083 --> 34:04.484
Jubal, we have no idea how
many eyes are on the street.

34:05.254 --> 34:07.756
I don't think we should make
any sudden movements.

34:10.326 --> 34:12.460
Yeah.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.132
This fool says he knows you.

34:21.837 --> 34:23.004
He does.

34:25.107 --> 34:26.908
What's up, homie?

34:26.942 --> 34:28.777
All good.

34:28.811 --> 34:29.944
Yeah, I don't mean to bother you.

34:29.978 --> 34:31.746
I'm just here to relay some information.

34:31.781 --> 34:33.179
Hmm.

34:33.783 --> 34:36.583
FBI's been asking about me and Jabari.

34:36.619 --> 34:38.553
Yeah, yeah, uh,

34:38.587 --> 34:42.056
they came to me 'cause Jabari...
he rents my cab,

34:42.091 --> 34:44.190
but they also asked about you.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.696
Asked if I knew you,
if I ever seen you two talking,

34:48.731 --> 34:50.280
so...

34:51.033 --> 34:52.657
So yeah.

34:53.536 --> 34:54.768
What did you tell them?

34:54.804 --> 34:56.804
Nothing.

34:56.839 --> 34:58.206
I know the drill.

35:00.075 --> 35:01.743
Why did you lie?

35:03.813 --> 35:05.346
What's your take?

35:11.420 --> 35:13.521
I thought maybe...

35:19.962 --> 35:23.164
Yes, that's no problem.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.001
I appreciate you looking out.

35:31.740 --> 35:33.875
Where are you going?

35:33.909 --> 35:35.777
Why not get high right here?

35:37.947 --> 35:39.414
What... what you mean?

35:39.448 --> 35:41.182
If you came all the way here for that,

35:41.217 --> 35:43.351
- why not take a bump?
- You gotta be kidding me.

35:43.385 --> 35:44.686
I gotta pull him out.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.055
Well, no, hold on.
Let's just wait a second.

35:47.089 --> 35:48.890
Now.

35:48.924 --> 35:51.326
Um, I'm saving it for later.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.394
Me and my girl... we're g...
we're gonna share it.

35:53.429 --> 35:55.530
- Later.
- Yeah.

35:55.564 --> 35:58.700
Ain't no such thing as later
when you're an addict.

35:58.734 --> 36:00.335
Did you pat this fool down?

36:00.369 --> 36:02.036
He ain't got no strap.

36:02.071 --> 36:03.671
- C-come on, man.
- I ain't worried about no gun.

36:03.706 --> 36:04.973
Why y'all... why y'all doing this?

36:05.007 --> 36:07.308
Easter's right around the corner, man.

36:07.343 --> 36:08.843
He's been burned. Call it in now!

36:08.878 --> 36:10.144
All units move in. I repeat,

36:10.179 --> 36:11.913
all units move in.

36:30.659 --> 36:32.693
They bailed.

36:32.727 --> 36:34.509
Where the hell'd they go?

36:35.530 --> 36:37.097
And why'd they take Morris?

36:37.132 --> 36:38.632
To find out what he knows

36:38.667 --> 36:39.934
and dump him.

36:45.607 --> 36:46.840
Hey, guys, head back that way.

37:15.203 --> 37:16.718
I got him. There he is.

37:18.473 --> 37:19.796
FBI! Stop!

37:22.844 --> 37:24.411
Oof.

37:24.446 --> 37:26.313
Oh!

37:26.348 --> 37:27.781
Don't move! Freeze!

37:27.816 --> 37:30.117
- FBI!
- We got this.

37:30.151 --> 37:31.685
- Get in the car.
- FBI!

37:31.720 --> 37:33.220
Drop the gun! Don't move!

37:33.254 --> 37:35.623
Back off, now, or I'll shoot him.

37:35.657 --> 37:38.126
Put the weapon on the ground right now.

37:38.161 --> 37:39.259
It's over.

37:39.294 --> 37:40.427
We are driving out of here,

37:40.462 --> 37:41.962
or I'll shoot him right now.
It's your choice.

37:41.997 --> 37:43.964
You're not leaving with him.
It's not gonna happen,

37:43.999 --> 37:47.034
so put your gun down,
or I will shoot you.

37:47.068 --> 37:48.606
Oh, take the shot! He's gonna kill me!

37:48.640 --> 37:51.705
Shut up! I'm not saying it again.

37:54.643 --> 37:56.510
I got you. I got you.

37:59.381 --> 38:02.182
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah.

38:04.853 --> 38:06.435
I got you, Mo.

38:07.822 --> 38:09.423
I got you.

38:15.897 --> 38:17.297
- Um...
- Hey,

38:17.332 --> 38:19.239
before you say anything...

38:21.036 --> 38:25.105
uh, I just want to say
I'm... I'm really sorry

38:25.140 --> 38:26.913
about your friend Juan.

38:27.676 --> 38:30.110
Maggie just told me that he passed away.

38:33.148 --> 38:34.882
I had no idea.

38:37.085 --> 38:39.051
Thanks. Um...

38:39.988 --> 38:42.888
I was in over my head.

38:44.125 --> 38:48.829
I didn't even know that he was an addict.

38:52.534 --> 38:56.804
Well, it can be pretty hard to spot,

38:56.838 --> 38:59.239
unless you've lived
with the disease yourself.

39:06.781 --> 39:11.885
Um... how's Morris?

39:11.920 --> 39:13.353
He's good.

39:13.388 --> 39:17.089
Yeah, he's... he's strong.

39:17.826 --> 39:19.860
- He did great.
- Yeah.

39:19.894 --> 39:22.596
It's not an easy position to be in,

39:22.630 --> 39:26.934
especially as an ex-addict.

39:28.870 --> 39:32.562
Well, there's no such thing, really.

39:32.941 --> 39:35.039
All it takes is one bad day.

39:41.546 --> 39:44.051
Anyway, have a good night.

39:44.085 --> 39:45.152
Yeah.

40:04.305 --> 40:06.006
May I come in?

40:15.683 --> 40:17.482
Uh...

40:18.353 --> 40:22.923
So I... I came by to say...

40:26.861 --> 40:29.763
well, I wish I was a better sponsor.

40:34.202 --> 40:36.503
I am truly sorry.

40:45.039 --> 40:46.303
Now,

40:48.449 --> 40:50.390
do you have what Tayo gave you?

40:56.524 --> 40:58.231
Come on, Mo.

41:00.094 --> 41:02.863
Yes.

41:04.232 --> 41:05.906
There you go.

41:09.671 --> 41:11.896
Come on.

41:19.714 --> 41:21.415
And just the one baggie?

41:27.422 --> 41:29.471
Yeah, it's okay.

41:30.859 --> 41:33.725
It's just a slip, not a leap.

41:34.662 --> 41:36.296
Okay?

41:56.384 --> 41:58.250
So what now?

41:58.820 --> 42:02.389
There is a meeting two blocks from here,

42:02.423 --> 42:05.025
and it starts in a half an hour...

42:08.796 --> 42:12.766
And we are going to go together.

42:18.306 --> 42:19.999
You and me.
