00:01.835 --> 00:02.753
That was hillarious!

00:02.920 --> 00:04.546
We're back in two minutes!

00:04.713 --> 00:06.256
So are you going to
ask out the Head?

00:06.423 --> 00:07.424
The Head?

00:07.591 --> 00:10.093
There are these two MSNBC guys
we keep seeing around,

00:10.260 --> 00:13.013
and we don't know their names,
so we call them the Head and the Hair.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.431
How come?

00:14.598 --> 00:18.227
So what are you, like 6'2"?

00:19.856 --> 00:22.100
6'5".

00:22.273 --> 00:23.191
Wow.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.233
I see you're looking at my watch.

00:25.409 --> 00:26.152
What?

00:26.319 --> 00:27.313
It's cool, isn't it?

00:27.487 --> 00:28.771
That's a Japanese pie watch.

00:28.947 --> 00:29.862
Oh, okay.

00:30.035 --> 00:31.650
It tells time with
those little pie pieces.

00:31.828 --> 00:33.492
Each piece is six minutes.

00:33.657 --> 00:36.952
So right now,
it's six times four.

00:37.126 --> 00:39.282
5:30. That can't be right.

00:39.458 --> 00:42.750
My watch has these little hands
that go around and point at numbers.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.541
Hey, that's awesome, possum.

00:44.717 --> 00:45.581
One minute!

00:45.756 --> 00:48.502
The point is,
the Hair is ridiculously good looking.

00:48.678 --> 00:49.040
It's true.

00:49.218 --> 00:50.501
He makes me nervous just to be around.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.671
And the Head is perfectly harmless
and totally into Ms. Liz Lemon.

00:53.848 --> 00:53.921
Hmm...

00:54.096 --> 00:56.513
Not as much as
he's into his pie watch.

00:56.685 --> 00:58.471
I think the Head sounds perfect
for you right now.

00:58.646 --> 01:01.141
I mean, low pressure,
high nerd factor, come on.

01:01.318 --> 01:01.720
If you're serious

01:01.895 --> 01:03.231
about getting your personal life on track,

01:03.395 --> 01:04.102
you need to work at it.

01:04.275 --> 01:06.103
Okay, fine!
I'll ask him out.

01:06.276 --> 01:07.192
I win.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.483
No, the French maid werewolf thing is cut.

01:08.657 --> 01:10.191
You're supposed to be
Hillary Clinton right now.

01:10.366 --> 01:11.321
What? Pete!

01:11.487 --> 01:12.900
- Gary!
- Lutz!

01:13.077 --> 01:15.202
What do you think sounds like
the better idea for a new show?

01:15.366 --> 01:18.161
A talk show without a host,
just the voice of the dead lady

01:18.327 --> 01:19.161
from Desperate Housewives,

01:19.328 --> 01:25.831
or a reality show with a lot of super hot nannies
who move into a house and help fat kids lose weight?

01:26.007 --> 01:27.000
Never mind.

01:27.178 --> 01:31.963
This television programming stuff
is just one unpredictable ass ache,

01:32.135 --> 01:34.881
and I want you to get it out of here.

01:35.055 --> 01:35.760
Kenneth, please.

01:35.925 --> 01:36.761
Come in.

01:36.937 --> 01:39.473
Is this about the clementine
I took off the actors' snack table?

01:39.647 --> 01:41.011
Because the catering lady
already talked to me.

01:41.187 --> 01:42.472
No, no.

01:42.645 --> 01:45.931
No, I wanted to talk to you
about our corporate "Bottoms Up" day.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.601
Once a year,
all the Senior VPs spend one day

01:48.777 --> 01:51.652
doing the job of one
of our lowest level employees.

01:51.826 --> 01:57.153
Last year I was a welder
at one of our locomotive factories,
and I made this.

01:57.327 --> 01:58.532
And this year,

01:58.708 --> 02:01.372
I'll be a page for a day,
and you'll be my boss.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.740
Thank you, sir.

02:02.917 --> 02:05.163
That's how the "Bottoms Up" program works.

02:05.335 --> 02:07.712
I'm going to be your bottom, Kenneth.

02:07.878 --> 02:12.592
And I want you to ride me
as hard as you can.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074

02:29.946 --> 02:32.111
Dude, this party was messed up!

02:32.277 --> 02:34.070
They had girls dancing in cages.

02:34.235 --> 02:39.033
And not the go-go cages, the little dog cages
that you crate pit bulls in.

02:39.208 --> 02:40.160
That is awesome.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.870
- That is upsetting.
- That is awesome.

02:42.035 --> 02:43.033
It couldn't have been
that great a party.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.661
You're on time to work
for the first time ever.

02:45.837 --> 02:46.873
January 17th.

02:47.047 --> 02:49.123
Write it down, Cerie.
It's historic.

02:49.298 --> 02:51.082
How dare you, Liz Lemon?

02:51.256 --> 02:52.711
I'm not arriving to work.

02:52.887 --> 02:56.802
I left the party on a bacon run.

02:56.965 --> 02:59.132
Write it down, Cerie.
January 17th.

02:59.308 --> 03:01.842
Just like every other day.

03:02.018 --> 03:03.602
Oh, what's today's date?

03:03.765 --> 03:05.260
January 17th.

03:05.438 --> 03:06.723
2 007?

03:06.898 --> 03:08.602
- Yeah.
- Ah, dammit!

03:08.778 --> 03:09.943
I knew this was going to happen.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.443
Toofer, pass me some paper.

03:11.605 --> 03:12.523
What's wrong?

03:12.697 --> 03:16.651
My autobiography is due tomorrow.

03:23.456 --> 03:24.123
Morning, boss.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.240
I'm sorry I'm late.

03:25.417 --> 03:27.832
Well, don't let it happen again.

03:28.006 --> 03:29.831
Are you ready for an exciting
and challenging day?

03:30.008 --> 03:31.170
You bet.

03:31.335 --> 03:32.331
(Tracy) Yo!

03:32.507 --> 03:35.213
Me, Toofer, and Frank are gonna
be writing my book all day long,

03:35.385 --> 03:37.841
and I think my snake is sick,
so I need you to go out to my car

03:38.016 --> 03:41.682
and rub his belly 'til he poops.

03:41.845 --> 03:45.101
Our first assignment.

03:45.857 --> 03:47.471
This is so annoying.

03:47.648 --> 03:51.312
I just went down to the ATM to get money,
and it gave me a hundred-dollar bill.

03:51.488 --> 03:52.603
- So?
- So?

03:52.775 --> 03:55.313
It's like having Confederate money.
No one's going to take that.

03:55.487 --> 03:56.150
Whatever.

03:56.328 --> 03:58.820
It'll give you something interesting
to talk to the Head about.

03:58.987 --> 04:00.283
Oh, yeah. Am I doing that?

04:00.445 --> 04:03.412
Yeah, right now.

04:08.796 --> 04:09.581
Hi, can I help you?

04:09.757 --> 04:13.210
Yes, I'm looking for... the Head?

04:13.375 --> 04:14.460
The head of what?

04:14.636 --> 04:15.712
Yeah, how am I going to do this?

04:15.885 --> 04:17.500
Hi. What are you doing up here?

04:17.678 --> 04:20.593
Oh, Chris Matthews owes me ten bucks.

04:20.765 --> 04:22.470
Yeah, you'll never get that.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.223
My name is Gray, by the way.

04:24.386 --> 04:24.932
You know, it's kind of funny.

04:25.095 --> 04:28.180
My friend Jenna and I didn't know your name,
so we've been calling you the Hair.

04:28.357 --> 04:29.560
The Hair?

04:29.727 --> 04:31.731
How would you like it
if I called you Glasses?

04:31.898 --> 04:32.682
I would be fine with that.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.810
Oh, good, because that's
what I've been calling you.

04:34.986 --> 04:37.560
Which was no help when I was trying
to find your extension.

04:37.736 --> 04:38.863
Why were you trying to find my extension?

04:39.027 --> 04:40.692
I have a friend who's opening up
a new restaurant in SoHo,

04:40.867 --> 04:41.941
and I was hoping
that you'd go with me.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.073
What? 

04:43.245 --> 04:46.743
Do you want to go out with me tonight?

04:46.918 --> 04:48.242
Why?

04:48.418 --> 04:53.000
Because it would be fun.
And you seem cool.

04:53.506 --> 04:54.253
What?

04:54.415 --> 04:55.790
1979.

04:55.966 --> 05:00.503
I  was looking for some money in my mother's room,
and I found  some naked pictures under her mattress.

05:00.678 --> 05:04.841
She was just sitting there in her house coat,
holding one of her boobs like this.

05:05.017 --> 05:08.013
I knew she must have taken
those pictures for her boyfriend Sonny.

05:08.188 --> 05:09.681
Because Sonny used to come over twice a month.

05:09.858 --> 05:13.060
You  knew when Sonny was coming over,
'cause she would take us to the store

05:13.237 --> 05:16.900
and buy two steaks
and a bottle of Nair with cocoa butter.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.650
How many pages do we have now?

05:19.907 --> 05:21.232
Five.

05:21.406 --> 05:23.070
Make the letters bigger, Toof.

05:23.247 --> 05:29.160
According to Wikipedia,
you were discovered after doing stand-up
at the Apollo in 1984.

05:29.328 --> 05:32.200
I have no memory of that.
Write it up.

05:32.377 --> 05:36.543
Here is your salad.
And your change.

05:37.088 --> 05:38.290
Oh, no.

05:38.466 --> 05:39.841
Dude, is this spinach?

05:40.005 --> 05:41.962
Yes, you, uh--

05:42.137 --> 05:43.550
You asked for a spinach salad.

05:43.715 --> 05:46.340
No, I like the stuff
that comes on the spinach salad,

05:46.513 --> 05:48.841
but I wanted it with romaine.

05:49.017 --> 05:50.893
So you want me to take it back?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.602
I'm supposed to treat you like Kenneth, right?

05:53.779 --> 05:54.312
Yes.

05:54.477 --> 05:55.890
Well, then, yeah, genius.

05:56.067 --> 05:57.443
Get me a new salad.

05:57.608 --> 06:01.860
Or get me a time machine
so I can go back in time and smack your mom

06:02.026 --> 06:05.113
for smoking crack
while she's pregnant.

06:05.288 --> 06:06.202
Too much?

06:06.367 --> 06:10.242
No, that's usually how it goes.

06:13.298 --> 06:15.411
Hey, what happened?
Did you ask him?

06:15.585 --> 06:16.542
Well, I was going to.

06:16.716 --> 06:17.541
Oh, Liz.

06:17.718 --> 06:20.751
But before I could,
the Hair asked me out.

06:20.925 --> 06:22.882
What? The the Hair?

06:23.055 --> 06:23.803
What did you say?

06:23.965 --> 06:24.923
I had to say yes.

06:25.096 --> 06:27.052
He looked at me
with those crazy handsome-guy eyes.

06:27.225 --> 06:29.511
It was like the Death Star tractor beam
when the Falcon is--

06:29.686 --> 06:30.092
No, Liz.

06:30.266 --> 06:31.642
Do not talk about stuff like that
on your date.

06:31.805 --> 06:33.260
Guys like that do not like Star Trek.

06:33.435 --> 06:34.561
Wars!

06:34.726 --> 06:36.600
I'm sorry.
You're right.

06:36.777 --> 06:38.732
I don't go out on dates
with guys like Gray.

06:38.896 --> 06:40.022
It feels wrong.

06:40.197 --> 06:43.613
He's the Hair,
and I am a Head-plus, at best.

06:43.775 --> 06:48.153
Or maybe you really are the Hair
and I'm the Head in our relationship.

06:48.327 --> 06:49.320
Oh, God, no.

06:49.495 --> 06:50.953
Something is wrong with this.

06:51.117 --> 06:53.283
I have upset the natural balance of things.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.952
Good morning, ladies.
I'm making a coffee run.

06:55.125 --> 06:59.411
Would either of you care for anything?

07:00.177 --> 07:03.541
Liz and Jenna, nothing.

07:06.555 --> 07:07.763
What's happening?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.723
I don't know.

07:13.186 --> 07:15.970
Good God, what does that man doing here?

07:16.146 --> 07:16.851
I don't know.

07:17.026 --> 07:18.560
I've never met Brian Williams,

07:18.738 --> 07:22.022
but his dressing room has to be
cleaned up every day between 11 and 11:30.

07:22.197 --> 07:25.821
That way, by the time Mr. Williams
gets back from the liquor store,
it's nice and tidy.

07:25.987 --> 07:30.532
Kenneth, a friend of mine tipped me off
about a position in our aviation division.

07:30.708 --> 07:33.202
It's entry level only, of course.

07:33.378 --> 07:35.660
Is this tube sock
filled with bird seed?

07:35.835 --> 07:36.373
Yes, sir.

07:36.548 --> 07:39.201
Just put it in the basket
with the others.

07:39.378 --> 07:41.872
At any rate, I'd be happy
to put in a good word for you.

07:42.047 --> 07:42.673
What?

07:42.836 --> 07:43.671
And leave show business?

07:43.836 --> 07:45.343
No, thank you.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.800
Kenneth, what's your plan?

07:46.966 --> 07:51.511
Well, I like to start cleaning in one corner,
and then work my way across the room in a zig-zag.

07:51.685 --> 07:53.180
No, no, no. Your life plan.

07:53.345 --> 07:54.600
You're learning nothing here.

07:54.766 --> 07:55.723
You're doing nothing here.

07:55.896 --> 07:58.021
You're a punching bag.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.473
I like this job.

07:59.646 --> 08:04.693
Kenneth, this is not a job.
This is an exercise in constant humiliation.

08:04.866 --> 08:06.150
You're fired.

08:06.328 --> 08:08.441
I beg your pardon?

08:08.616 --> 08:13.493
You said I'm your boss for today.
So I fire you.

08:35.726 --> 08:38.510
How ya doin'?

08:38.934 --> 08:40.559
Liz!

08:40.726 --> 08:42.890
Hi.

08:43.067 --> 08:47.901
This  is Kiara, Francesca,
that's Talbot and that's Armand.

08:48.077 --> 08:48.823
Hello.

08:48.986 --> 08:49.650
Would you like something to drink?

08:49.826 --> 08:53.991
- Yes, Pinot Grigio.
- I'll be right back.

08:54.156 --> 08:56.873
Is that bad?

08:57.957 --> 08:58.993
So...

08:59.168 --> 09:00.082
you guys been

09:00.246 --> 09:03.212
watching Heroes?

09:04.166 --> 09:07.672
I like the Japanese dude.

09:08.005 --> 09:12.133
The hors d'oeuvres tonight are boxes of pure oxygen
infused with a saffron and a white truffle oil.

09:12.306 --> 09:14.551
Wow.

09:15.807 --> 09:19.050
Hey, how is it going?

09:20.436 --> 09:21.391
Terrifying.

09:21.567 --> 09:22.101
It's too much.

09:22.276 --> 09:23.811
I just want to go home
and watch that show about midgets

09:23.986 --> 09:25.810
and eat a block of cheddar cheese.

09:25.987 --> 09:28.862
If it makes you feel any better,
I've discovered I'm not a Head.

09:29.028 --> 09:30.653
I'll talk to you later.

09:30.826 --> 09:34.442
Let's put the fun in funky.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.001
Hey!

09:43.168 --> 09:44.453
Hey, what are you doing?

09:44.626 --> 09:48.793
Sorry, that party was just
a little too awesome for me.

09:48.966 --> 09:51.250
Do you want to go someplace else,
just the two of us?

09:51.427 --> 09:53.302
Okay, what's your game, friend?

09:53.467 --> 09:55.513
Game? There's no game.

09:55.675 --> 09:56.343
What are you talking about?

09:56.515 --> 09:58.262
I don't have any money,
if that's what you're after.

09:58.436 --> 10:00.930
And I'm not one of those girls
that does weird stuff in bed,

10:01.106 --> 10:02.561
because they think they have to.

10:02.725 --> 10:05.980
If you're a gay guy looking for a beard,
I don't do that anymore.

10:06.145 --> 10:10.770
And if you're trying to harvest my organs and sell them,
I have an uncle who's a cop, so don't even try it.

10:10.947 --> 10:15.693
Hey, we all have uncles who are cops,
so just take it down a notch.

10:15.867 --> 10:17.653
No hundreds. Small bills.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.320
Oh, I knew this was going to happen.

10:19.496 --> 10:20.283
Store policy.

10:20.455 --> 10:23.242
Yeah, that's an illegal policy.
You have to take this.

10:23.416 --> 10:24.290
No, I don't.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.371
Yeah, sir. You do.

10:25.548 --> 10:28.213
See? It says right here:
"Legal tender for all debts
public and private."

10:28.375 --> 10:30.712
Does it say anything about $100
for a bottle of water?

10:30.888 --> 10:32.672
You can't decide
what money you'll accept.

10:32.846 --> 10:34.511
- That's illegal.
- It's an illegal policy.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.513
You're holding up the line.

10:35.678 --> 10:39.551
No, you're holding up the line.

10:50.858 --> 10:51.901
1998.

10:52.068 --> 10:57.111
Well, I spent most of the summer
in the studio doing my Christmas album, which was huge.

10:57.286 --> 11:00.161
I'm almost afraid to ask.
What Christmas album?

11:00.325 --> 11:03.161
* Imagine Christmas wishes

11:03.338 --> 11:06.581
* Shooting out of your eyes

11:06.755 --> 11:07.873
* A candy cake

11:08.047 --> 11:09.462
* Full of snow dreams

11:09.627 --> 11:13.251
* A stocking full of smiles

11:14.887 --> 11:17.212
* It's a Jordan Christmas *

11:17.388 --> 11:21.130
I remember that.
That video was raunchy.

11:21.307 --> 11:23.720
Mm-hmm.

11:26.018 --> 11:26.433
Hi.

11:26.605 --> 11:27.431
Hi. 

11:27.605 --> 11:29.601
- Did you get home okay last night?
- Yeah.

11:29.777 --> 11:31.402
Thank you for convincing me
to go back to the party.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.521
It was fun.

11:32.698 --> 11:34.901
Although I ate way too much oxygen.

11:35.076 --> 11:39.281
Yeah, you actually got a little oxygen
right there on your... coat.

11:39.446 --> 11:40.702
Thank you.

11:40.868 --> 11:44.990
This is going to sound pathetic,
but I'm kind of trying to make myself do new things,

11:45.168 --> 11:46.833
and last night was

11:46.996 --> 11:49.582
all  new for me,
so that's good.

11:49.757 --> 11:52.832
Okay, so here's something else
I bet you've never done before.

11:53.008 --> 11:55.423
Call in sick to work
and go see a movie.

11:55.595 --> 11:56.133
A movie?

11:56.405 --> 11:56.923
A movie.

11:57.097 --> 11:58.051
- With you.
- With me.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.761
- Now.
- Right now.

12:00.925 --> 12:03.393
Come on.

12:04.398 --> 12:05.930
Good.

12:06.106 --> 12:07.972
Oh, Pete, it's me.

12:08.147 --> 12:13.023
I'm not coming in.
I have a flu thing, and I'm--

12:16.445 --> 12:20.113
I just barfed on 6th Avenue.

12:20.996 --> 12:22.611
Hi, Jack.

12:22.788 --> 12:24.570
I was, uh--

12:24.746 --> 12:26.703
This is Gray.

12:26.878 --> 12:29.832
Nice to meet you.

12:30.007 --> 12:33.622
Lemon, you're looking
a little under the weather.

12:33.795 --> 12:37.293
Maybe you should go home.

12:40.096 --> 12:42.551
Come on.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.101
Kenneth, do you have a minute?

12:48.267 --> 12:49.933
I sure don't.

12:50.108 --> 12:53.393
Kenneth, you and I actually
have a lot in common.

12:53.566 --> 12:54.650
We're both hard workers.

12:54.818 --> 12:57.732
When I was your age,
I was putting myself through college in Boston,

12:57.908 --> 13:00.403
paddling swan boats for the tourists.

13:00.578 --> 13:02.783
Is that a euphemism
for some kind of sex worker?

13:02.957 --> 13:07.201
Kenneth, my point is, I worked hard,
because I wanted to get somewhere.

13:07.377 --> 13:08.583
I had drive.

13:08.748 --> 13:16.330
And it disappoints me to see you without a dream,
content with this meaningless, pitiful job.

13:17.388 --> 13:21.211
Do you know why I put up
with this pitiful job, Mr. Donaghy?

13:21.388 --> 13:24.683
Why I fetch these folks' lunches
and clean up their barfs?

13:24.845 --> 13:27.220
Because they make television.

13:27.396 --> 13:35.022
And more than jazz, or musical theater,
or morbid obesity, television is the true American art form.

13:35.197 --> 13:38.811
Think of all the shared experiences
television has provided for us.

13:38.987 --> 13:43.033
From the moon landing
to the Golden Girls finale.

13:43.197 --> 13:49.412
From Walter Cronkite denouncing Vietnam
to Oprah pulling that trash bag of fat out in a wagon.

13:49.586 --> 13:53.373
From the glory and the pageantry
of the Summer Olympics

13:53.547 --> 13:55.541
to the less fun Winter Olympics.

13:55.718 --> 14:00.000
So please, don't tell me
I don't have a dream, sir.

14:00.177 --> 14:03.423
I am living my dream.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.722
Oh, my.

14:05.885 --> 14:09.050
How did he get that up there?

14:09.228 --> 14:12.263
I wish I shared your passion
for television, Kenneth.

14:12.437 --> 14:14.221
Which show would you rather watch?

14:14.396 --> 14:19.062
An ex-porn star who talks to ghosts,
or a remake of Little House on the Prairie?

14:19.238 --> 14:20.151
Neither.

14:20.315 --> 14:22.572
I want to see a show
where women get their hair done,

14:22.736 --> 14:24.651
while listening to salsa music.

14:24.826 --> 14:26.573
I also have an idea for a cop show.

14:26.745 --> 14:29.161
Called K-9, exclamation point.

14:29.326 --> 14:32.161
Oh, and a game show called Gold Case.

14:32.337 --> 14:40.000
It's a cross between Deal or No Deal
and Millionaire, with a charming celebrity host to be determined.

14:40.178 --> 14:41.253
Go on.

14:41.425 --> 14:42.960
It's called Gold Case.

14:43.135 --> 14:45.923
It's Deal or No Deal meets Millionaire.

14:46.098 --> 14:49.050
There are ten models,
each holding an identical briefcase,

14:49.225 --> 14:52.181
but one of them is filled with gold.

14:52.356 --> 14:55.352
Have you pitched this idea to anybody else?

14:55.527 --> 14:58.770
Well, I talked to Moonvest over at CBS.

14:58.948 --> 15:03.820
Les Moonves, president of CBS,
knows about this?

15:05.368 --> 15:08.070
Hey, Moonvest,
I got an idea for a game show last night.

15:08.245 --> 15:09.362
Give me your fingernails!

15:09.536 --> 15:11.700
No!

15:12.076 --> 15:13.993
We've got to move fast.

15:14.168 --> 15:18.040
Mr. Parcell, we love Gold Case.

15:18.295 --> 15:21.790
How do we make...
your show?

15:21.965 --> 15:25.340
I thought y'all would know
where to get cameras and stuff.

15:25.505 --> 15:28.012
I think he means,
"How much do you want for it?"

15:28.178 --> 15:29.551
Oh.

15:29.727 --> 15:34.890
As far as compensation goes,
I would like to be officially the head of the pages,

15:35.068 --> 15:38.140
and I need a new clock radio.

15:38.317 --> 15:42.692
You've got it up there,
now snap it off.

15:43.526 --> 15:47.360
Also I want five points on the back end,
20% gross on merchandizing,

15:47.538 --> 15:50.900
and a creator credit
on this and any international editions.

15:51.077 --> 15:54.162
And a clock radio.

15:55.377 --> 15:57.042
We're a go.

15:57.205 --> 15:58.700
Congratulations.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.172
Thank you.

16:01.336 --> 16:05.463
Woke up in the camper at the auto show,
and that's how 2006 ended.

16:05.636 --> 16:06.752
2007?

16:06.925 --> 16:07.590
I can't believe this.

16:07.756 --> 16:09.460
We're actually going to pull this off.

16:09.637 --> 16:14.680
It was early January 2007
when I got the idea to write my autobiography.

16:14.855 --> 16:19.063
So I took a meeting at Random House,
and I went in and talked to this editor about it,

16:19.228 --> 16:24.151
and this dude looked me straight in the eyes and said,
"No, Mr. Jordan. No, thank you.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.861
We do not want your book."

16:28.486 --> 16:30.150
Oops, my bad.

16:30.327 --> 16:31.202
That's on me.

16:31.367 --> 16:34.161
Shut it down.

16:40.255 --> 16:41.083
No way.

16:41.258 --> 16:45.290
Your elevator opens right
into your apartment?

16:45.468 --> 16:46.503
Are you coming in?

16:46.676 --> 16:48.883
I don't know.
This is new for me.

16:49.056 --> 16:52.011
I don't really hang out
with superfluously handsome gentlemen

16:52.176 --> 16:55.801
in kick-ass elevator lofts.

16:57.556 --> 16:59.891
What else don't you do?

17:00.068 --> 17:01.643
I don't smoke.

17:01.815 --> 17:04.943
I don't use any drugs,
except for my allergy medicine.

17:05.106 --> 17:08.403
I don't download music
without paying for it.

17:08.578 --> 17:10.611
And I never wear flip-flops. Ever.

17:10.785 --> 17:12.109
It's gross.

17:12.285 --> 17:15.240
Real? It's real.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.622
I do not sit on laps.

17:17.786 --> 17:18.333
Really?

17:18.496 --> 17:20.792
No, not a lap-sitter.
Never have been.

17:20.954 --> 17:24.292
Nice to see you again.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.042
I thought you were trying new things.

17:28.217 --> 17:30.500
Okay.

17:32.055 --> 17:35.470
It's just-- It's a small girl thing,
it's not a grown lady thing.

17:35.635 --> 17:36.551
Okay.

17:36.725 --> 17:37.893
All right, there you go.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.811
Okay? 

17:39.975 --> 17:40.760
Mm-hmm.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.982
See? It's not so bad.

17:43.146 --> 17:46.143
No, it's not bad.

17:46.568 --> 17:47.313
I can't--

17:47.487 --> 17:49.233
I keep waiting for something to go wrong.

17:49.408 --> 17:52.323
Liz, I am not gay,
I am not married,

17:52.487 --> 17:55.281
I don't have a human head in my freezer.

17:55.458 --> 17:58.370
Yeah,  but you're the Hair.

17:58.536 --> 18:01.450
And so are you.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.332
Okay, we're going to do this, then.

18:03.506 --> 18:05.913
Mm-hmm.

18:08.675 --> 18:11.343
Why do you have a picture
of my great-aunt Dolly?

18:11.605 --> 18:15.551
Uh, no, that's my grandmother's cousin Dolly.

18:15.725 --> 18:17.092
Dolly Harlan.

18:17.265 --> 18:18.393
No, I said Dolly...

18:18.556 --> 18:19.760
... Harlan.

18:19.937 --> 18:20.930
From Smithtown.

18:21.107 --> 18:22.681
Oh, my God.
We're related.

18:22.856 --> 18:24.431
Oh, no. Oh, God.

18:24.605 --> 18:24.931
Wow.

18:25.107 --> 18:27.900
This is the worst!

18:28.066 --> 18:31.192
Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were fifth cousins.

18:31.368 --> 18:33.860
Okay, on the count of three,
say what level of cousins

18:34.035 --> 18:35.690
we would have to be
for this to be okay.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.360
One, two, three.

18:37.535 --> 18:38.610
- Fifth.
- Unacceptable, no matter what.

18:38.787 --> 18:39.990
This is never going to work.

18:40.165 --> 18:42.240
Of course it's not.
It never was.

18:42.417 --> 18:45.453
This is what I get
for trying to be somebody I am not.

18:45.628 --> 18:46.873
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:47.048 --> 18:48.871
Look, look.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.290
I meant what I said earlier.

18:50.466 --> 18:52.043
You are a Hair, Liz Lemon.

18:52.216 --> 18:53.631
It's in our blood.

18:53.806 --> 18:55.383
Accept it.

18:55.558 --> 18:58.221
Embrace it.

18:59.436 --> 19:00.682
I think we're third cousins.

19:00.846 --> 19:04.891
Yeah, I'll see you at the reunion.

19:08.776 --> 19:13.070
Kind of wish you had a door right now.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.413
All right, Jeff.

19:21.575 --> 19:28.250
One of these briefcases
is filled with a million dollars'
worth of solid gold.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.792
Are you ready?

19:29.966 --> 19:33.211
Let's play Gold Case!

19:39.516 --> 19:41.513
That one.

19:41.687 --> 19:43.140
Congratulations.

19:43.307 --> 19:47.061
You struck gold on Gold Case.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.060
- Uh-oh.
- What?

19:50.238 --> 19:52.352
That one.

19:52.528 --> 19:55.070
That one.

19:55.946 --> 19:58.491
That one.

19:58.786 --> 19:59.780
Congratulations.

19:59.955 --> 20:02.450
You struck gold on Gold Case.

20:02.617 --> 20:05.741
Oh, gold's real heavy, isn't it?

20:05.915 --> 20:07.292
This game doesn't work.

20:07.458 --> 20:08.790
Okay, my bad.
Shut it down.

20:08.955 --> 20:10.160
Shut it down!

20:10.335 --> 20:11.670
That's it!

20:11.838 --> 20:15.673
At least you got a clock radio
out of it, right?

20:15.848 --> 20:19.051
Whose idea was this?

20:19.346 --> 20:21.090
This is pathetic.

20:21.267 --> 20:25.302
A joke.
This whole show is a joke.
