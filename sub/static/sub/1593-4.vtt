WEBVTT

00:03.713 --> 00:06.705
(ticking )

00:28.738 --> 00:31.275
(pounding)
Hey! Hello!

00:31.449 --> 00:33.235
Hey!

00:33.409 --> 00:36.196
( police radio chatter)

00:38.623 --> 00:41.114
( radio chatter continues )

00:44.837 --> 00:46.748
Everything's okay. Okay?

00:46.923 --> 00:49.380
Put it down.
Drop it right now.

00:51.636 --> 00:53.251
I'm Dr. Steven Edwards.

00:56.641 --> 00:58.006
Where am I?

00:58.184 --> 01:01.096
Grady Memorial Hospital
in Atlanta.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.931
How did I get here?

01:03.105 --> 01:04.686
My officers found you
on the side of the road

01:04.857 --> 01:06.188
surrounded by rotters.

01:06.359 --> 01:07.519
Your wrist was fractured

01:07.693 --> 01:09.149
and you sustained
a superficial head wound.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.686
Can you remember
your name?

01:11.864 --> 01:13.320
Beth.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.739
The man l was with,
is he here, too?

01:22.917 --> 01:23.906
Dawn:
You were alone.

01:24.085 --> 01:26.747
If we hadn't saved you,
you'd be one of them right now.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.421
So you owe us.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.301
(theme music playing )

02:15.011 --> 02:18.674
- ( monitors beeping )
-( respirator hissing )

02:20.933 --> 02:23.675
Couple of them out there
were on a run about a week ago.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.559
They found two boxes of Bisquick

02:25.730 --> 02:27.686
and a Merle Haggard tape
at a truck stop,

02:27.857 --> 02:30.098
and then this gentleman
under a bridge.

02:30.276 --> 02:32.733
Cardiac arrest
and extreme dehydration.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.563
I tried to do what I could.

02:36.741 --> 02:38.823
-( respirator stops )
- ( rapid beeping )

02:38.993 --> 02:42.360
Wait, that's it?

02:42.538 --> 02:45.371
If patients don't show
any signs of improvement...

02:45.541 --> 02:46.906
( flatline beeps )

02:47.084 --> 02:48.665
Well, Dawn calls it.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.383
(squelching )

03:03.100 --> 03:06.092
(no audible dialogue)

03:14.737 --> 03:16.978
- Hold up.
- J‘ The sun has finally come J‘

03:17.156 --> 03:21.115
J‘ Time to toss the flowers
the patient say J‘

03:26.916 --> 03:28.656
J‘ A key lime pie J‘

03:28.834 --> 03:30.449
J‘ Pulled apart for five J‘

03:30.628 --> 03:33.540
J‘ To wash the last surprise J‘

03:38.844 --> 03:40.960
J‘ This ain't rational J‘

03:41.138 --> 03:42.878
J‘ The dawn will burst J‘

03:43.057 --> 03:45.639
J‘ The room will flood with light J‘

03:46.852 --> 03:49.969
J‘ You were born a little low J‘

03:50.981 --> 03:53.973
J‘ Never mind the other... J‘

03:57.113 --> 03:59.149
Come on.
Body's getting cold.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.111
J‘ It's been so long... J‘

04:08.040 --> 04:09.905
How many people live here?

04:10.084 --> 04:11.494
Just enough to keep us going.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.955
Some of us started here.
Some came as patients.

04:14.130 --> 04:15.995
Everyone has a job.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.913
Can't we bury him?

04:18.092 --> 04:20.128
No, we only go out
when we need to.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.759
It may not be the most
dignified disposal system,

04:22.930 --> 04:26.093
but we work
with what we have.

04:26.267 --> 04:29.304
We've managed to secure
and guard the stairwells,

04:29.478 --> 04:31.639
but the windows are blown out
on the ground floor.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.350
Rotters find their way
into the basement

04:33.524 --> 04:34.513
when they hear a noise.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.978
And if the bodies are warm,
or warm enough,

04:37.153 --> 04:38.984
they clean up
some of the mess.

04:39.155 --> 04:40.895
Use everything
you can use.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.280
Plus it's the fastest
way down.

04:45.161 --> 04:46.867
( crash )

04:47.037 --> 04:48.538
( splatter)

04:48.706 --> 04:51.322
(walkers snarling )

05:02.428 --> 05:04.669
You're looking better and better.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.930
We had a lead on some guns,

05:09.101 --> 05:11.478
so me and my partner
were pretty far out.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.849
That's when we saw you,

05:15.024 --> 05:17.060
wriggling in the road.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.691
You don't remember me, huh?

05:19.862 --> 05:22.569
l was fighting a walker.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.856
And then everything went black.

05:25.034 --> 05:29.198
Yeah, one was eyeing your thighs
when we showed up.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.862
But I got there first.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.906
Jacked that rotter up.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.541
l'm Gorman.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.248
When someone
does you a favor,

05:38.422 --> 05:41.380
it's a courtesy to show
some appreciation.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.762
Unless you want me to write down
everything you're taking.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.424
Everything costs
something, right?

05:56.732 --> 05:58.472
Huh.

05:58.651 --> 06:01.017
Dawn:
Well, find Joan.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.561
Until then,
you've got laundry duty

06:03.739 --> 06:04.728
and lwant my uniform...

06:04.907 --> 06:07.239
Both: ...washed separately
and pressed.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.116
I know.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.027
Smart-ass.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.949
(music playing )

06:20.923 --> 06:23.039
(sighs)

06:23.217 --> 06:26.084
| used to feel like
lwas drowning in research.

06:26.262 --> 06:28.628
Now the oceans are dry

06:28.806 --> 06:31.513
and I'm suffocating
in boredom.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.929
You're lucky.

06:35.104 --> 06:38.471
If you feel safe enough
to be bored,

06:38.649 --> 06:40.264
you're lucky.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.980
That's Junior Kimbrough.
You like it?

06:47.032 --> 06:49.990
I can't remember the last time
I heard a record.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.151
It's one of the few perks | get

06:52.329 --> 06:53.535
for being the only doctor here.

06:53.706 --> 06:57.619
That and whatever this is?

06:57.793 --> 06:59.408
Guinea pig.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.293
Where's your food?

07:01.463 --> 07:04.045
The more I take,
the more I owe, right?

07:04.216 --> 07:06.127
Hey.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.794
Have you ever tried
guinea pig?

07:11.557 --> 07:13.138
I didn't think so.

07:13.309 --> 07:14.640
You wouldn't call it a perk.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.641
( chuckles )

07:16.812 --> 07:18.348
Sit down.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.058
Dawn doesn't have to know.
Come on.

07:26.697 --> 07:27.857
Here.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.829
( chuckles )

07:42.671 --> 07:44.627
Well?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.459
-Hmm.
-(|aughs)

07:46.634 --> 07:48.215
It's good enough for Peru.

07:52.765 --> 07:54.630
It's a Caravaggio.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.220
I found it on the street
outside the High.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.725
Like trash.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.261
It's beautiful.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.930
It doesn't have
a place anymore.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.104
Art isn't about survival.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.855
It's about transcendence.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.194
Being more than animals.

08:13.369 --> 08:14.609
Rising above.

08:14.787 --> 08:16.948
We can't do that anymore?

08:19.041 --> 08:20.577
I don't know.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.867
lsing.

08:23.045 --> 08:25.377
lstill sing.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.003
- We got a new one.
- Man: Found his wallet.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.419
His name is Gavin Trevitt.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.303
Woman: Fell from
a first floor apartment

08:35.474 --> 08:37.089
trying to get away from some.

08:38.394 --> 08:39.554
(no audible dialogue)

08:39.728 --> 08:41.264
He's lost a lot of blood
and his vitals are dropping.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.769
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.396
- We've already given him gas--
- I got this.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.978
You said you wanted
to save people, so save him.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.983
I don't even know
the extent of his injuries.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.269
Look, this one's a loser.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.778
You said you didn't want me
wasting resources.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.655
Well, today I want you to try.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.568
Okay, plug the EKG
and the ultrasound

08:57.746 --> 08:59.657
into that battery pack.
Go. Good.

08:59.832 --> 09:02.073
Good, good, good.
Now attach it to the patient.

09:02.251 --> 09:05.414
(monitor beeping )

09:07.798 --> 09:10.585
( rapid beeping )

09:10.759 --> 09:12.920
Tension pneumothorax.
Punctured lung.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.586
Beth, I need a large hollow
needle in that cabinet.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.470
( groans )

09:31.864 --> 09:34.606
( beeping slows)

09:40.414 --> 09:41.699
Is he gonna make it?

09:41.874 --> 09:43.830
He fell from a building, Dawn.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.367
Is he going to make it?

09:47.588 --> 09:48.794
You see these bruises?

09:48.964 --> 09:50.329
He has internal bleeding,

09:50.507 --> 09:51.622
but I need a CAT scan
to know how bad.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.040
And even if I could
determine that,

09:53.218 --> 09:54.958
I don't have the tools
to save him.

09:55.137 --> 09:59.005
I told you, this was a waste
of resources.

10:05.063 --> 10:08.476
Steve, try to grasp
the stakes here.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.739
( door slams)

10:22.498 --> 10:23.988
Beth:
Is she always like that?

10:24.166 --> 10:25.326
Steven:
Only on her bad days.

10:25.501 --> 10:29.540
It's unfortunate for us
that's the only kind she has.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.537
Noah left you a new shirt.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.217
What's wrong with this one?

10:34.384 --> 10:36.545
She likes things neat.

10:38.347 --> 10:39.837
She must love your office.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.971
We all have ways
of making her pay.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.349
I'll wait for you outside.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.370
Dawn needs you, now.

11:14.967 --> 11:17.709
Dawn:
She's lucky we found her.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.877
Whatever you were thinking,
it wasn't worth it.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.046
Okay, you have two choices.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.634
Either we cut off your arm
or you do.

11:23.809 --> 11:26.892
Screw you
and your little bitch!

11:27.062 --> 11:29.804
- Smart-ass whore.
- Gorman, get out of here!

11:32.234 --> 11:34.725
(humming)

11:36.405 --> 11:39.067
- ( grunts )
- lt's anesthetic. You need it.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.983
- Go to hell.
- She made her choice. Do it.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.617
Do it.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.495
No, no, no!
I said leave me alone!

11:47.666 --> 11:49.156
We're not going to let you die.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.620
- We are not going to let you turn.
- ( Joan crying)

11:51.795 --> 11:53.786
Where do you think
you're going?

11:55.090 --> 11:56.921
- I can't help.
- Do you want her to die?

11:57.092 --> 11:58.878
Beth, I need you
to hold her down.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.464
- Do it now. Now.
- ( sobbing )

12:01.638 --> 12:03.253
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Come on.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.923
Keep your hands off me!

12:06.101 --> 12:07.602
I'm not going back to him!

12:07.769 --> 12:09.100
You don't have to.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.683
- You can't control them.
- I will.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.722
Beth, you ready?

12:13.901 --> 12:16.938
(screaming )

12:29.249 --> 12:31.456
(hissing)

12:31.627 --> 12:34.243
( door opens, closes)

12:36.089 --> 12:38.626
You okay?

12:38.800 --> 12:40.301
l'm Noah...

12:40.469 --> 12:42.835
of the Lollipop Guild.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.754
Beth.

12:47.559 --> 12:48.674
Thanks for that.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.138
Figured you could
use a pick-me-up

12:51.313 --> 12:54.100
after this morning.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.686
Guess I should have
brought the whole jar.

12:59.321 --> 13:01.482
Here, this should fit.

13:05.494 --> 13:08.486
You know what
happened with Joan?

13:08.664 --> 13:11.827
If she'd have stayed,
worked for a while,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.331
couldn't she have just left?

13:13.502 --> 13:14.833
( chuckles )

13:15.003 --> 13:17.210
I haven't seen it
work like that yet.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.167
How long have you been here?

13:19.341 --> 13:20.831
I guess about a year.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.881
Dad and l were
both pretty messed up

13:29.059 --> 13:31.516
when they found us.

13:31.687 --> 13:34.178
They said that they could
only save one.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.893
For the longest time,
I actually believed them.

13:38.694 --> 13:41.310
Now | get it.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.730
Dad was bigger, stronger.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.409
Would have fought back.

13:46.576 --> 13:47.565
Would have been a threat.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.030
They left him behind
on purpose?

13:50.205 --> 13:52.617
And Dawn just looked
the other way.

13:52.791 --> 13:56.249
See, she's in charge,
but just barely.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.581
And it's getting worse.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.997
It's why I'm out of here
when the time is right.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.251
I came looking for my uncle.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.511
Gotta get back to my mom.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.217
Where's home?

14:09.391 --> 14:10.972
Richmond.

14:11.143 --> 14:13.179
Virginia.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.389
We had walls.

14:15.564 --> 14:18.806
See, they think I'm scrawny.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.896
They think I'm weak.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.277
But they don't
know shit about me.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.568
About what I am.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.075
About what you are.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.250
Shepherd, you've already
pulled a double.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.584
- I got it from here.
- Yes, ma'am. Thanks.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.250
I know you didn't
have breakfast.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.384
Peace treaty?

14:48.555 --> 14:50.261
I don't need much.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.764
I'm not staying any longer
than you make me.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.284
You know, you shouldn't
see this as a sentence.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.365
I'm giving you food,
clothes, protection.

15:18.543 --> 15:21.125
When have those things
ever been free?

15:21.296 --> 15:22.285
I never asked for your help.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.170
But you needed it.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.132
Try to look at
the good we're doing.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.257
Hard as it was,
we saved Joan's life.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.721
Trevitt's life.
We saved your life.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.184
I'm keeping
all of us going here.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.350
That is not a small thing.

15:50.992 --> 15:54.325
It's taken a lot
to get us here, Beth.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.863
And I believe that what we had
before all of this isn't over.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.790
And when we're finally rescued,

16:00.961 --> 16:02.667
when this nightmare ends,

16:02.838 --> 16:04.294
we're gonna need to rebuild.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.250
You don't really think
someone's coming for us?

16:06.424 --> 16:08.335
There's still people like us, Beth.

16:08.510 --> 16:11.297
People trying to keep
the world alive, to fix it.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.678
Until then,
we all have to contribute.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.928
To compromise.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.889
If we take, we give back.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.019
It's only fair.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.649
So keep working off
what you owe

16:26.820 --> 16:28.902
and you'll be
out of here in no time.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.407
- If that's what you want.
- It is.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.361
Well, then you have to eat.

16:34.703 --> 16:37.319
Otherwise, you'll get weak.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.829
You won't heal,
you'll require more treatment,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.332
and you won't be able
to do yourjob.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.546
I know you didn't ask for this.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.552
I didn't either.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.574
(Beth humming)

17:22.000 --> 17:23.740
Hmm.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.037
That's really nice.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.636
I'll get Dr. Edwards.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.759
No, please.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.923
Not yet.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.849
I'm so sorry.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.107
She can control them.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.613
But she doesn't
because it's easier.

17:58.536 --> 17:59.946
Because she's a coward.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.830
What did he do to you?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.376
It doesn't matter.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.414
I guess it's easy to make
a deal with the devil

18:08.588 --> 18:11.045
when you're not the one
paying the price.

18:30.485 --> 18:33.352
( clock ticking )

18:59.055 --> 19:00.886
Lose something?

19:02.684 --> 19:04.174
This is yours, ain't it?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.391
Mmm.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.857
Sour apple.

19:16.031 --> 19:18.738
Like the kind Dawn
acquired from pediatrics.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.734
Suppose you could
have a taste.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.039
See if it rings any bells.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.697
- I don't want it.
- Oh, come on, now.

19:27.876 --> 19:28.865
| just want to be sure

19:29.044 --> 19:31.285
I'm returning this
to its rightful owner.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.585
Ah, ah.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.716
Yeah. That's right.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.515
- That's right. That's right.
- Leave her alone.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.933
The girl should have
been mine.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.397
Nobody's yours, Gorman.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.312
Nobody.

19:59.491 --> 20:00.947
And if you think
you're getting Joan back--

20:01.117 --> 20:03.233
Oh, I'm gonna get her back.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.493
You think Dawn's
gonna stop me?

20:07.082 --> 20:09.118
|wi||.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.499
You stepping up, Doc?

20:14.005 --> 20:17.168
What happens when
you get sick, Gorman?

20:17.342 --> 20:20.209
When you get an infection?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.173
When you get bit?

20:22.347 --> 20:24.008
Hmm.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.514
I think there's
gonna be somebody.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.675
Somebody who ain't you.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.097
Dawn:
Gorman.

20:33.942 --> 20:37.184
And maybe somebody
in charge who ain't her.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.876
Beth:
Why do you stay?

20:55.046 --> 20:56.786
You could leave
whenever you want.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.330
Why do you stay here?

21:05.306 --> 21:06.807
( door opens)

21:06.975 --> 21:08.556
( footsteps )

21:08.726 --> 21:12.139
Welcome to the ground floor
of Grady Memorial Hospital.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.929
This isn't a way out.
There isn't one.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.558
Not from here.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.232
Why'd you bring me here?

21:21.406 --> 21:23.146
Watch.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.196
( clanging )

21:29.038 --> 21:31.825
(snarling )

21:36.963 --> 21:38.828
When I start thinking
about it too much,

21:39.007 --> 21:40.838
I come down to look at this.

21:41.009 --> 21:42.920
Why'd you bring me here?

21:44.929 --> 21:47.011
You asked why I stay.

21:53.188 --> 21:56.021
Come on.
Let me tell you a story.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.362
When everything started,

22:09.537 --> 22:11.869
Dawn reported to a guy
named Hanson.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.281
They had orders
to clear the hospital

22:14.459 --> 22:17.041
and move everyone
to Butler Park.

22:17.212 --> 22:20.204
It was close to midnight
when we heard the jets,

22:20.381 --> 22:22.372
the bombs.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.875
The screams.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.260
l was on the third floor.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.052
and we knew it was bad.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.217
Just didn't know how bad
till we came up here.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.055
The city had fallen.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.681
And everyone we evacuated...

22:43.363 --> 22:44.398
they were just gone.

22:47.242 --> 22:49.733
We kept mostly
to ourselves at first.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.617
Till the food ran out.

22:53.873 --> 22:57.286
We started going out on runs,
a few of us at a time.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.576
We'd see people
who needed help.

22:59.754 --> 23:01.164
Barely holding on,

23:01.339 --> 23:04.797
but we were barely
holding on ourselves.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.262
Came a time I couldn't
look away anymore.

23:09.931 --> 23:13.423
I found this kid,

23:13.601 --> 23:16.343
napalm burns on his clothes,

23:16.521 --> 23:18.432
his skin.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.523
Dawn said we couldn't
spare the resources.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.518
So we struck a deal.

23:25.697 --> 23:28.188
I'd use what I could to heal him
and he'd compensate us

23:28.366 --> 23:30.152
for those resources
through service.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.317
( scoffs )

23:33.580 --> 23:35.662
Now...

23:37.208 --> 23:40.120
You're not the problem.

23:40.295 --> 23:42.581
We lost people.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.791
That was the problem.

23:44.966 --> 23:46.172
Hanson cracked.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.128
He made some calls
that got people killed.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.177
Dawn took care of things.

23:53.516 --> 23:55.677
She took care of him.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.970
She saw us past it.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.854
Kept us together.

24:03.151 --> 24:05.016
Kept us alive.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.313
You call this living?

24:09.490 --> 24:11.071
( chuckles )

24:12.327 --> 24:14.158
I'm still breathing.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.824
Patients we brought here,
they're still breathing.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.114
Outside these walls,

24:19.292 --> 24:20.372
alone, unprotected,
they'd be dead.

24:20.543 --> 24:22.158
We'd be dead.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.245
We're not the ones
who make it.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.925
As bad as it gets,

24:31.095 --> 24:33.211
it's still better
than down there.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.346
I should get back.

24:41.648 --> 24:42.763
How about you look in
on Mr. Trevitt

24:42.940 --> 24:45.192
- and call it a day?
- Okay.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.022
He's stable, due for another
75mg of Clozapine.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.689
And tomorrow
we'll start fresh.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.732
Sure.

25:04.629 --> 25:06.870
(monitor beeping )

25:29.529 --> 25:30.939
Noah:
SﬁHatH,huh?

25:31.114 --> 25:32.854
Hey.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.657
( rapid beeping )

25:36.828 --> 25:38.910
(gasping )

25:40.832 --> 25:43.118
No.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.374
What?

25:45.545 --> 25:46.910
No.

25:47.088 --> 25:49.170
(grunts)

25:50.174 --> 25:51.789
What did you do to him?

25:53.594 --> 25:56.836
He was fine until the two of you
were alone with him.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.926
Something happened.
I want you to tell me.

26:00.101 --> 26:02.513
It was an accident.
Beth left to get some gauze.

26:02.687 --> 26:03.893
l was mopping.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.052
I must have unplugged
the ventilator somehow.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.516
- It only stopped for a minute.
- Beth: But that's--

26:06.691 --> 26:08.977
Noah:
I got it working again.

26:09.152 --> 26:10.642
Take him to my office.

26:13.114 --> 26:15.605
Dawn, it was an accident.
It was an accident.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.364
That's not what happened.

26:17.535 --> 26:21.027
He just--
he just started seizing.

26:21.205 --> 26:22.490
Seizing?

26:22.665 --> 26:25.452
Well, you gave him
Clonazepam, right?

26:25.626 --> 26:27.617
Cloz-- Clozapine.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.624
You said Clozapine.

26:34.552 --> 26:37.635
No, I didn't.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.508
- Noah: Please!
-( blows landing)

26:40.683 --> 26:42.719
Beth, we need to deal with Mr. Trevitt
while he's still warm.

26:42.894 --> 26:46.136
- l have to stop it!
- Noah: Please, stop!

26:46.314 --> 26:48.475
- Please!
- We can't-- you can't stop it.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.649
You really think
I didn't know?

27:03.831 --> 27:05.162
Noah's smart.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.494
Probably my best worker.

27:07.668 --> 27:10.796
But that story he told
about the ventilator?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.954
Boy's not much of a liar.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.794
If you knew,
then why did you--

27:15.968 --> 27:18.960
I didn't want to.
I had to.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.799
A good man's mistakes

27:20.973 --> 27:22.304
almost ended
everything for us,

27:22.475 --> 27:24.716
and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let that happen again.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.891
Every sacrifice we make

27:30.066 --> 27:32.057
needs to be
for the greater good.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.105
The second it isn't,

27:35.279 --> 27:37.144
the second we lose
sight of that,

27:37.323 --> 27:39.154
it's all over.

27:44.705 --> 27:47.082
The thing is, you're not
the greater good.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.372
- You're not strong enough.
- I am strong.

27:51.546 --> 27:54.083
How many people had to risk
their lives to save you?

27:54.257 --> 27:57.875
ln here, you are part
of a system.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.097
The wards keep
my officers happy.

28:02.265 --> 28:03.846
The happier my officers are,

28:04.016 --> 28:06.758
the harder they work
to keep us going.

28:09.063 --> 28:11.850
And this hasn't been easy.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.481
There have been compromises,

28:14.652 --> 28:16.517
but it's working.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.732
And after they rescue us,

28:18.906 --> 28:21.022
we're gonna help put
the world back together.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.485
Because we're the ones
holding on.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.446
That's the good we're doing here.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.202
That's the good you're doing here.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.364
That's what makes you
worth something.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.201
But out there...

28:35.256 --> 28:36.587
you are nothing...

28:39.594 --> 28:41.459
except dead
or somebody's burden.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.093
- That's bullshit.
- Oh, yeah?

28:43.264 --> 28:46.222
I saw this the night
you came in.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.257
Is this bullshit, too?

29:00.573 --> 29:02.655
Some people just aren't
meant for this life,

29:02.825 --> 29:04.065
and that's okay...

29:07.622 --> 29:08.987
as long as they
don't take advantage

29:09.165 --> 29:10.951
of the ones who are.

29:22.136 --> 29:23.637
Noah:
It's not as bad as it looks.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.508
I'm okay.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.673
Watch.

29:28.851 --> 29:30.933
Painkillers.
lt barely even hurts.

29:34.649 --> 29:36.014
Dawn needed Trevitt
for something.

29:36.192 --> 29:38.023
I know that's what
that was about.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.814
Screwed-up thing is,

29:41.989 --> 29:43.490
she's trapped, too.

29:43.658 --> 29:45.990
We're not trapped.

29:47.828 --> 29:50.319
I'm going with you.

29:54.835 --> 29:57.087
Basement's
the fastest way out.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.040
Any noise and we got rotters.

29:59.215 --> 30:00.876
So we won't make noise.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.792
I can keep an eye on Dawn.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.881
She keeps a spare key
to the elevator banks

30:06.055 --> 30:07.135
somewhere in her office.

30:08.516 --> 30:10.006
Think you can find it?

30:12.061 --> 30:13.471
Yeah.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.562
( chatting )

30:19.193 --> 30:22.185
(man laughing)

30:23.656 --> 30:25.647
In the back.

32:18.729 --> 32:20.640
Hey there.

32:23.484 --> 32:26.100
I hope I'm not interrupting.

32:28.364 --> 32:29.945
Dawn was just asking
for her key.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.027
Was she, now?

32:32.201 --> 32:34.988
See, lwasjust with Dawn

32:35.162 --> 32:37.323
and I don't seem
to remember that.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.157
It's okay.

32:41.335 --> 32:43.451
Maybe she doesn't
have to know.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.125
Maybe there's another solution.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.085
You know?

32:49.260 --> 32:51.922
A little win-win for both of us.

32:53.013 --> 32:54.719
( sniffs )

33:00.354 --> 33:02.515
So how about it, Bethy?

33:03.607 --> 33:05.188
We gonna work
something out here?

33:07.361 --> 33:09.818
Good girl.

33:09.989 --> 33:13.823
Now, Joan, she's not
such a team player.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.702
Lucky for me...

33:19.707 --> 33:21.743
you're not a fighter.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.704
- ( groans)
- ( snarling)

33:24.879 --> 33:27.370
(gurgling)

33:46.692 --> 33:48.978
Noah:
Yeah, it may just be the battery.

33:49.153 --> 33:50.893
I'll stop in
and grab another one.

33:51.071 --> 33:52.652
Okay.

33:54.617 --> 33:56.403
Beth.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.157
Everything okay?

34:02.791 --> 34:05.203
Oh, Joan was
looking for you.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.244
I saw her and Gorman
headed towards your office.

34:12.259 --> 34:13.999
Thank you, Beth.

34:22.770 --> 34:25.637
( man screaming )

34:35.366 --> 34:37.448
(fabric ripping )

34:39.203 --> 34:40.818
( people shouting )

34:40.996 --> 34:42.111
Ready?

34:42.289 --> 34:44.245
Yeah.

34:46.669 --> 34:48.830
Once you're safe,
l'll climb down.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.619
Okay.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.304
(grunts)

35:04.478 --> 35:06.719
(whimpering)

35:12.820 --> 35:14.560
( screams )

35:18.325 --> 35:20.281
( panting )

36:03.704 --> 36:05.444
(snarling )

36:07.875 --> 36:10.036
( screams )

36:10.210 --> 36:12.622
- ( panting )
- Beth: Noah?

36:12.796 --> 36:15.253
Noah? Noah?

36:17.384 --> 36:19.375
(grunts)

36:25.476 --> 36:27.592
( groans )

36:29.313 --> 36:31.895
( both groaning )

36:43.577 --> 36:45.113
Can you walk?

36:45.287 --> 36:47.073
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Okay.

36:57.341 --> 36:59.081
(walkers snarling )

36:59.259 --> 37:00.999
There.

37:08.852 --> 37:11.013
- ( snarling )
- ( gasps )

37:14.942 --> 37:17.149
(gunshot)

37:17.319 --> 37:19.810
( gunshots)

37:19.988 --> 37:21.023
Noah: Help.

37:21.198 --> 37:23.405
(high-pitched whining)

38:00.904 --> 38:03.065
(snarling )

38:30.767 --> 38:33.144
( gunshots)

38:44.031 --> 38:46.113
(snarling )

38:59.379 --> 39:01.210
Who the hell
do you think you are?

39:01.381 --> 39:03.963
He attacked me.

39:06.220 --> 39:08.677
Just like he attacked Joan.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.301
Just like you let him.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.636
You know
what's happening here

39:13.810 --> 39:14.890
and you let it happen.

39:15.062 --> 39:17.144
- You're letting it happen.
- So that we make it.

39:17.314 --> 39:19.305
No one's coming, Dawn.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.438
No one's coming.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.229
We're all gonna die

39:27.407 --> 39:30.240
and you let this happen
for nothing.

39:47.261 --> 39:48.626
(grunts)

39:51.431 --> 39:53.922
Record:
J‘ Nobody's fault but mine J‘

39:54.101 --> 39:57.593
J‘ If I don't read it,
my soul be lost... J‘

40:00.607 --> 40:02.393
Edwards:
You're healing quickly.

40:02.568 --> 40:04.433
Should be ready
tojump back into it

40:04.611 --> 40:05.771
in a couple more days.

40:08.782 --> 40:10.773
Well, that should about do it.

40:12.119 --> 40:14.360
How'd you know
Trevitt was a doctor?

40:16.123 --> 40:19.081
That's why you had me
give him the wrong meds, right?

40:19.251 --> 40:21.367
Why you had me kill him.

40:23.714 --> 40:26.376
'Cause if he had lived,
there'd be another doctor

40:26.550 --> 40:28.836
and Dawn wouldn't need you.

40:29.970 --> 40:31.926
She wouldn't protect you.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.011
Trevitt was an oncologist
at St. Ignatius.

40:40.564 --> 40:42.771
I knew him.

40:50.824 --> 40:53.657
They would have kicked me out.

40:53.827 --> 40:55.692
Maybe Gorman...

40:58.373 --> 41:00.238
maybe he would have
killed me.

41:02.669 --> 41:03.829
I didn't have a choice.

41:04.004 --> 41:06.245
Use everything you can use.

41:10.344 --> 41:11.675
Edwards:
When they arrested Christ,

41:11.845 --> 41:14.336
Peter denied being one
of his disciples.

41:18.435 --> 41:20.892
He didn't have a choice.

41:23.523 --> 41:24.854
They would have
crucified him, too.

41:31.782 --> 41:33.773
J‘ Lord, Lord J‘

41:39.623 --> 41:43.832
J‘ Ain't nobody's
fault but mine J‘

41:44.002 --> 41:46.209
J‘ Nobody's fault but mine J‘

41:46.380 --> 41:49.713
J‘ If I don't read it,
my soul be lost J‘

41:51.259 --> 41:54.342
J‘ l have a Bible

41:55.555 --> 41:57.841
J‘ l have a Bible

41:58.016 --> 42:01.179
J‘ If I don't read it,

42:02.688 --> 42:04.303
IMmmI

42:05.524 --> 42:07.606
J‘ l have a Bible

42:07.776 --> 42:10.563
J‘ If I don't read it,

42:10.737 --> 42:13.774
