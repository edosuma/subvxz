00:26.059 --> 00:30.496
- Hear it change, Todd,
the change is coming.

00:30.498 --> 00:31.498
- I know.

00:35.635 --> 00:38.237
You don't have to remind me.

00:40.407 --> 00:43.709
- What are you gonna
do about it, Todd?

00:46.479 --> 00:48.781
- I'm taking him to the farm.

00:50.417 --> 00:53.252
- Why? You need
to go to a group.

00:55.655 --> 00:58.390
- I'm not taking him to a group.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.427
- He needs people,
he's just a kid...

01:01.429 --> 01:03.328
- stop!

01:04.596 --> 01:08.834
How can you say that after
what happened last time?

01:11.638 --> 01:13.472
- It's what he wants.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.308
- No.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.312
People are dangerous.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.350
That's the only truth now.

01:29.489 --> 01:31.557
We're going to the farm.

01:41.668 --> 01:44.236
- Is that what's best for him?

01:52.679 --> 01:55.747
- He doesn't know
what's best for...

02:16.436 --> 02:17.436
Hey.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.700
Go where I can see you.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.747
- Todd.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.817
Don't blame yourself, Todd.

03:50.296 --> 03:51.897
Hey.

03:51.899 --> 03:52.899
Time to go.

04:32.939 --> 04:33.939
Last one.

04:34.841 --> 04:35.974
Make it last.

04:38.745 --> 04:42.347
We're going into the town
we saw the other day.

04:42.349 --> 04:43.349
You ready?

04:44.817 --> 04:45.817
Let's go.

05:32.765 --> 05:33.865
Benny!

09:44.016 --> 09:45.283
You can have 'em.

10:12.778 --> 10:13.778
Hey!

10:15.014 --> 10:17.616
We don't have room for toys.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.285
You know that.

10:22.689 --> 10:25.290
- Shut up and get
in the shadows.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.930
- You have three
seconds before...

10:31.932 --> 10:33.031
- quiet.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.232
Over there.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.104
Come here.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.960
- Damn it, Benny.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.136
- Benny, no!

11:47.339 --> 11:48.339
No!

12:34.520 --> 12:36.221
What have I told
you about fighting?

12:36.223 --> 12:36.921
Huh?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.824
They're bigger and
stronger than you.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.059
You know that.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.965
Thanks for watching my back.

12:54.473 --> 12:56.207
You know what to do.

12:58.077 --> 13:00.345
- Well, I suppose a
thanks is in order.

13:00.347 --> 13:04.215
Although, you know, if
you weren't so loud.

13:13.092 --> 13:14.926
I haven't seen you
around here before.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.361
- It's a big world.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.064
- Yeah, well, I
know most drifters.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.966
- Yeah, well, you don't know me.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.168
And I don't know you.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.170
Let's keep it that way.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.177
- You know there's a shop
that you can trade...

13:32.179 --> 13:34.112
- yeah, I know of it.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.413
- I thought you weren't
from around here?

13:35.415 --> 13:36.548
- I never said that.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.049
- Hey.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.484
My kill, my spoils.

13:41.854 --> 13:42.854
- Let's go.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.057
More can show up any second.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.133
- Hey.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.435
For your arm. Now we're even.

14:00.139 --> 14:02.207
You know we could
use someone like you.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.374
We have food and water.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.076
- No.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.111
- We're working on a cure.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.182
- There is no cure.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.120
There's just this.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.120
- It's safe.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.924
And there's other kids
for the little guy.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.426
- I said no.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.194
- Do you really think
that's what's best for him?

14:23.196 --> 14:26.631
- Don't tell me how
to raise my brother.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.399
- Don't ever touch me.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.234
Go ahead. Kill me.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.170
It doesn't change anything.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.106
You might be a hard ass but
it doesn't mean that he is.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.575
Go ahead. Do it. Please.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.177
You're what? 17, 18.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.412
How much longer do you
think you have, hmm?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.581
Where does that live him?

14:44.350 --> 14:45.483
- Go to hell.

14:47.453 --> 14:48.887
We're leaving.

14:51.156 --> 14:52.457
- There's a place for you.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.092
For the both of you.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.027
We're just on the edge of town.

14:56.029 --> 14:56.895
- Don't care.

14:56.897 --> 14:57.896
- Yeah, well, you should.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.097
- Well, I don't.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.584
Hey, here's a map.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.552
I circled our camp.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.621
They'll know I sent you.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.430
- Go.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.262
This place'll work.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.276
Thirsty?

18:37.616 --> 18:39.650
What are you drawing?

18:44.556 --> 18:46.791
Looks pretty good.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.693
You're getting better.

18:52.598 --> 18:53.598
Hey.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.301
I know that place sounds good.

18:57.903 --> 18:59.237
Alright?

18:59.239 --> 19:00.771
But it's not for us.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.808
Who do you trust?

19:08.180 --> 19:09.180
Todd.

19:10.549 --> 19:12.216
Todd, your brother.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.151
Say it.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.619
Who do you trust?

19:16.889 --> 19:17.889
Say it!

19:19.892 --> 19:21.692
Speak!

19:21.694 --> 19:23.828
Why don't you ever talk?!

19:28.634 --> 19:32.870
You know I could change
into a zombie any day now.

19:34.873 --> 19:37.808
Are you even gonna say good-bye?

19:38.877 --> 19:39.877
Huh?

19:49.321 --> 19:52.223
Alright. Go on,
hit me, tough guy.

19:56.261 --> 19:57.261
Get up.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.662
You don't need to be a killer

19:59.664 --> 20:01.566
but you're gonna learn
to defend yourself.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.568
Come on.

20:04.603 --> 20:05.603
Come on.

20:06.838 --> 20:07.939
Get up!

20:22.721 --> 20:23.721
Yeah?

20:24.790 --> 20:25.890
Yeah?

20:32.297 --> 20:34.532
Oh shit. Hey, hey, hey.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.834
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.836
Are you okay?

20:43.742 --> 20:44.742
All better?

20:46.411 --> 20:47.812
Can I get a hug?

21:02.828 --> 21:04.729
You know, you were just born

21:04.731 --> 21:08.366
so you probably wouldn't
remember the farm.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.969
It was something else.

21:12.804 --> 21:13.971
Green fields.

21:15.707 --> 21:19.543
A river that was nice
and cool in the summer.

21:20.846 --> 21:23.414
A big tree with a swing on it.

21:27.819 --> 21:29.754
We had wild animals.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.723
We'd have chickens and
we'd gather their eggs

21:32.725 --> 21:33.991
every single day.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.396
You know the best part?

21:39.598 --> 21:40.598
No zombies.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.634
No people.

21:45.904 --> 21:47.305
Just you and me.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.069
I know.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.071
Weird.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.440
You know the drill.

22:46.932 --> 22:48.966
We can't stay here.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.968
We need to keep moving.

23:22.534 --> 23:23.534
Thirsty?

23:27.706 --> 23:28.706
I know.

23:29.541 --> 23:30.941
I'm thirsty too.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.583
We'll find some water
in the morning. Alright?

23:39.585 --> 23:40.918
Get some sleep.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.141
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey. It's alright.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.110
It's alright, you're just
having a hebbie jebbie.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.112
Come here.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.791
You're alright, buddy.

24:20.793 --> 24:24.962
You got your whole
life before the change.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.198
At least eight more years.

24:34.105 --> 24:35.840
You want me to read?

24:36.775 --> 24:37.775
Alright.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.664
"Bandy legs".

25:01.233 --> 25:04.235
"As I was going to sell my eggs,

25:04.237 --> 25:06.804
I met the man with bandy legs.

25:07.772 --> 25:11.809
Bandy legs and crooked toes..."

25:22.521 --> 25:25.656
"bandy legs and crooked toes,

25:25.658 --> 25:28.826
I tripped us heels
and he fell on..."

25:40.605 --> 25:41.839
show yourself!

26:04.829 --> 26:06.230
Don't come any closer!

26:06.232 --> 26:09.567
- Steady. He means me no harm.

26:10.201 --> 26:13.637
- Yes, I do!

26:16.775 --> 26:17.775
- Easy.

26:18.610 --> 26:21.078
I only want to share your fire.

26:23.114 --> 26:24.315
- Bullshit!

26:24.317 --> 26:26.584
What are you doing
with bodyguards?

26:26.586 --> 26:28.886
- They are not my bodyguards.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.222
They were lost children once.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.159
Now, they are my family.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.799
Home is further than
we wish to wait.

26:41.801 --> 26:45.035
Share your fire,
we'll share the meat.

26:46.905 --> 26:48.072
A fair trade,

26:49.341 --> 26:50.341
I think.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.914
- No.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.649
This is our spot.

26:58.651 --> 27:01.118
- If I wanted to hurt you,

27:01.120 --> 27:03.654
I would've already done it.

27:05.857 --> 27:09.326
- There's more than
one way to hunt prey.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.299
- What are you doing?

27:16.935 --> 27:19.837
- Cooking you and
that boy dinner.

27:20.872 --> 27:22.906
- We don't want your meat.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.343
I know your kind.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.845
- You don't know me.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.780
- I know enough.

27:29.782 --> 27:32.216
- I'd love to hear
what you think

27:32.218 --> 27:33.984
you know about me.

27:35.654 --> 27:36.654
Water!

27:50.736 --> 27:52.803
- Don't come any closer!

28:20.732 --> 28:21.732
- Relax.

28:57.769 --> 28:58.402
- Hands where I can...

28:58.404 --> 28:59.404
- sit!

29:03.374 --> 29:04.374
Please.

29:16.988 --> 29:18.021
That's better.

29:20.391 --> 29:24.261
If you're not going
to let me feed you.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.263
The least I can do is

29:26.265 --> 29:27.998
satisfy other needs.

30:07.005 --> 30:09.339
We eat like this every night

30:09.341 --> 30:11.508
and have plenty to share.

30:12.944 --> 30:15.479
Are you sure you don't want any?

30:23.054 --> 30:24.121
- I said no.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.522
Drink you water!

30:28.493 --> 30:31.195
- Can I pour you another cup?

30:36.167 --> 30:37.935
- He's had enough.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.171
- I see.

30:47.445 --> 30:48.579
You're right.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.506
Do I make you that
uncomfortable?

31:54.479 --> 31:57.547
In my camp, we're all family.

31:57.549 --> 32:01.451
We live comfortably in
the woods by the lake.

32:03.421 --> 32:06.423
You could be a part
of that family.

32:08.126 --> 32:11.361
- I know what the plains
witch does to her family.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.165
- The plains witch?

32:15.167 --> 32:16.333
That's funny.

32:23.608 --> 32:26.677
How can I make you
more comfortable?

32:32.250 --> 32:33.250
- Leave.

32:34.252 --> 32:36.219
- You think those
stories are true?

32:36.221 --> 32:40.057
They're only lies
and half-truths.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.057
- Would your mother agree?

32:41.059 --> 32:43.226
- Where did you hear that?!

32:50.601 --> 32:51.601
- So, it's true.

33:29.073 --> 33:31.141
- Todd.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.143
Todd?

34:08.446 --> 34:09.446
- Benny?

34:11.149 --> 34:12.149
Benny!

35:11.776 --> 35:12.776
Hey.

35:15.780 --> 35:16.780
Hey, you.

35:18.249 --> 35:19.249
Hey.

35:20.451 --> 35:21.451
Hey.

35:22.386 --> 35:23.386
Kid.

35:25.223 --> 35:26.223
Kid?

35:56.254 --> 35:59.356
- You have to find him, Todd.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.358
- I will.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.901
- He doesn't like to be alone.

36:18.876 --> 36:19.876
- I know.

37:39.890 --> 37:40.924
- Did you hear that?

37:40.926 --> 37:41.926
- Shhh.

38:28.072 --> 38:29.839
Where's your camp?!

38:31.376 --> 38:32.442
Tell me now!

38:42.820 --> 38:44.788
You have three seconds.

39:02.973 --> 39:04.007
Take me there.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.096
How much further?

40:36.033 --> 40:38.935
- Matra will be
back, my children.

41:14.738 --> 41:15.805
Release him!

41:20.010 --> 41:23.012
So glad you could make it.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.714
- Where is he?!

41:24.716 --> 41:26.649
- My children, pay attention.

41:26.651 --> 41:27.550
- Shut up!

41:27.552 --> 41:28.818
Tell me where he is!

41:28.820 --> 41:31.020
- This is between you and I.

41:31.022 --> 41:32.022
Let 'em go.

41:34.124 --> 41:35.658
- If I die,

41:35.660 --> 41:37.260
I'm take you with me!

41:38.596 --> 41:41.564
- My children, here
is your lesson.

41:51.909 --> 41:52.742
Never

41:52.744 --> 41:53.810
underestimate

41:53.812 --> 41:54.511
your

41:54.513 --> 41:55.513
opponent.

41:56.247 --> 41:59.048
- What did you do to me?

41:59.050 --> 42:00.050
I can't...

42:03.687 --> 42:05.588
- put him in the cage.

42:55.339 --> 42:56.906
- Todd!

42:56.908 --> 42:58.007
It's happening.

43:00.811 --> 43:01.811
- Help me!

43:04.214 --> 43:05.315
- Help you do what?

43:05.317 --> 43:07.884
- Help me get it out!

43:07.886 --> 43:10.853
I can get it out!
I can get it out!

43:10.855 --> 43:11.854
I can get it out!

43:11.856 --> 43:14.223
- It doesn't come out, Todd.

43:14.225 --> 43:15.858
- I can get it out!

43:19.898 --> 43:21.831
- Don't do it, Todd!

43:24.301 --> 43:25.301
Todd!

43:30.975 --> 43:33.643
- He's changing!
Hey, he's changing!

43:33.645 --> 43:35.912
- No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

43:40.217 --> 43:41.951
- He's not changing.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.287
He's reliving his own hell.

43:51.095 --> 43:52.095
- Todd?

43:54.264 --> 43:55.965
- Benny, wait.

44:06.343 --> 44:07.343
Sarah!

44:14.885 --> 44:15.885
Sarah!

44:18.989 --> 44:20.389
- How do you know
he's not changing?

44:22.761 --> 44:24.894
- This is his punishment.

44:28.799 --> 44:29.866
- Sarah, no!

44:31.068 --> 44:32.068
- You did this to him.

44:32.070 --> 44:33.136
Make it stop!

44:33.138 --> 44:35.705
- Only he can make it stop.

44:35.707 --> 44:38.274
He allows his mind to be
tormented by the past.

44:38.276 --> 44:39.276
- Sarah!

44:40.077 --> 44:42.745
- Which makes him weak.

44:47.885 --> 44:51.954
- It's okay.
Breathe. Breathe. It's okay.

44:51.956 --> 44:56.192
It's okay. Just breathe. It's
okay. It's okay. Breathe.

44:59.797 --> 45:01.898
- I'm so sorry.

45:06.470 --> 45:07.470
- Todd.

45:08.906 --> 45:11.207
It's not your fault, Todd.

45:11.209 --> 45:14.043
- I wasn't there to protect you.

45:14.045 --> 45:16.813
How is that not my fault?

45:16.815 --> 45:18.214
- I forgive you.

45:20.250 --> 45:23.219
- I don't deserve
your forgiveness.

45:41.238 --> 45:42.071
Where is he?!

45:42.073 --> 45:43.239
Tell me, you bitch!

45:44.476 --> 45:48.044
- Do not speak to
immortal Matra that way.

45:50.481 --> 45:52.315
- If I find out you've harmed...

45:52.317 --> 45:55.918
- when you've learned
to speak to me properly,

45:55.920 --> 45:57.954
I will let you out.

45:57.956 --> 45:59.856
Until then, you
will remain in here

45:59.858 --> 46:02.959
with our other
troubled youngsters.

46:02.961 --> 46:06.429
- We'll never follow you!

46:06.431 --> 46:08.498
- Oh you will, my child.

46:08.500 --> 46:09.500
You will.

46:10.267 --> 46:13.035
Everyone has a breaking point!

46:21.512 --> 46:24.046
- How long have I been out?

46:26.850 --> 46:27.984
- Three days.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.562
- Now be sure to eat everything.

47:12.564 --> 47:15.832
We wouldn't want
any to go to waste.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.935
In order to gain
the strength within,

47:18.937 --> 47:22.038
it must be devoured completely.

47:22.040 --> 47:25.308
That is the promise
Alma makes to us all.

47:30.614 --> 47:33.282
Do any of you know who Alma is?

47:38.922 --> 47:41.357
Alma is our spiritual leader.

47:41.359 --> 47:44.160
She guides and protects us all.

47:44.162 --> 47:47.396
Much like how I guide
and protect you.

47:52.336 --> 47:55.104
But she demands commitment.

47:55.106 --> 47:58.140
We show commitment
to her in dances,

47:58.142 --> 48:00.042
sacrifices,

48:01.078 --> 48:02.311
and war.

48:15.993 --> 48:19.562
What do we do to those
who threaten our family?

48:19.564 --> 48:21.564
- We destroy them!

48:21.566 --> 48:23.232
- We destroy them!

48:23.234 --> 48:27.470
- Right. You wouldn't want
anyone to hurt our family,

48:28.272 --> 48:29.272
would you?

48:29.274 --> 48:30.106
- No!

48:30.108 --> 48:31.106
- No!

48:31.108 --> 48:35.177
- You wouldn't want anyone
to hurt me, your Matra,

48:35.179 --> 48:36.946
would you?

48:36.948 --> 48:38.614
- No.

48:38.616 --> 48:39.916
No.

48:39.918 --> 48:41.017
No.

48:41.019 --> 48:43.119
Those few hawks hurt your Matra.

48:43.121 --> 48:44.153
What are we gonna do about it?

48:44.155 --> 48:45.421
- Destroy them!

48:45.423 --> 48:46.322
Destroy them!

48:46.324 --> 48:47.156
- Again!

48:47.158 --> 48:47.990
- Destroy them!

48:47.992 --> 48:48.624
- Again!

48:48.626 --> 48:49.458
- Destroy them!

48:49.460 --> 48:49.958
- Again!

48:49.960 --> 48:50.927
- Destroy them!

48:50.929 --> 48:51.560
- Again!

48:51.562 --> 48:53.095
- Destroy them!

48:53.097 --> 48:54.097
- That's right.

49:08.378 --> 49:09.645
- Don't listen to what she says.

49:09.647 --> 49:12.715
- It's time for a
lesson in respect.

50:11.641 --> 50:12.775
- Please don't do this.

50:12.777 --> 50:14.777
Why are you doing this?

50:31.028 --> 50:32.028
- Quiet!

50:38.769 --> 50:41.370
When you do not
show respect to me,

50:41.372 --> 50:43.472
you do not show respect to Alma

50:43.474 --> 50:45.341
and she demands punishment

50:45.343 --> 50:47.777
for those disrespect her.

50:47.779 --> 50:49.612
- Please don't do this!

50:49.614 --> 50:54.150
- Only one of you, the stronger
one, will survive the day.

50:54.152 --> 50:56.052
The decision is yours.

50:59.156 --> 51:00.389
You may begin.

51:14.805 --> 51:17.373
Weakness is not tolerated here.

51:17.375 --> 51:21.610
If you do nothing, you are
useless and will be discarded.

51:25.315 --> 51:26.649
- Stop!

51:26.651 --> 51:27.649
- You can make this stop!

51:27.651 --> 51:30.219
All you have to do is prove
that you are stronger.

51:30.221 --> 51:32.221
Prove that you are ready
to show respect to Alma!

51:32.223 --> 51:34.123
- Ow!

51:34.125 --> 51:35.157
Please!

51:35.159 --> 51:36.157
- Last warning!

51:36.159 --> 51:38.127
If you do nothing,
you will be killed!

51:38.129 --> 51:39.129
Now, fight!

51:54.511 --> 51:55.511
Yes.

52:05.522 --> 52:06.522
- Please.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.689
- Well done, my dear.

53:15.492 --> 53:16.959
- Don't touch me.

53:37.747 --> 53:39.748
- You have proven your strength.

53:39.750 --> 53:42.585
Now, you must show your respect.

53:42.587 --> 53:45.254
You must eat your first kill.

54:10.513 --> 54:12.781
- You did what you had to.

54:17.520 --> 54:21.690
It's what you do now that
determines who you are.

54:32.569 --> 54:34.403
- It's time, my dear.

54:46.983 --> 54:49.518
- Remember who you are.

54:49.520 --> 54:50.686
Who you were.

54:54.924 --> 54:55.924
Remember.

55:01.564 --> 55:03.966
- You have proven your strength.

55:03.968 --> 55:06.368
Now you join the fight.

55:08.505 --> 55:09.738
This is yours.

55:11.474 --> 55:12.708
Use it wisely.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.079
Alma has made us a promise.

55:17.081 --> 55:19.048
If we honor her and respect her,

55:19.050 --> 55:21.016
she will Grant us immortality.

55:23.587 --> 55:25.654
We grow stronger every day.

55:25.656 --> 55:27.956
Soon we will be strong
enough to bring justice

55:27.958 --> 55:31.927
to those who held your
Matra prisoner for so long.

55:32.763 --> 55:34.630
War's coming.

55:34.632 --> 55:38.867
And each and every one of
you is just as important.

55:54.818 --> 55:58.354
You would hurt your Matra?

56:02.692 --> 56:04.793
- You're not my Matra.

56:09.833 --> 56:12.801
- Oh, my child! My
child. My child.

56:20.610 --> 56:22.845
My child! My child!

56:28.518 --> 56:30.519
Oh, my child. My child.

56:32.489 --> 56:34.022
This is what happens
when you allow your mind

56:34.024 --> 56:36.725
to be controlled by weakness!

56:38.595 --> 56:41.130
Let this be a lesson to you all!

56:42.866 --> 56:44.032
Oh, my child.

56:45.869 --> 56:46.869
My child.

57:07.657 --> 57:09.825
Look at what you've done!

57:11.761 --> 57:13.195
This is your fault.

57:17.667 --> 57:18.901
Open the cage.

57:23.773 --> 57:28.744
You poison my little girl
with your rebellious idea.

57:44.227 --> 57:45.594
Now, I'm gonna cut you!

57:45.596 --> 57:46.596
- Try it.

57:50.867 --> 57:53.969
- You're not afraid of death.

57:57.808 --> 57:59.975
We make such a good pair.

58:00.910 --> 58:02.945
Your strong offspring

58:04.214 --> 58:05.948
in me only.

58:05.950 --> 58:06.950
Offspring?

58:08.485 --> 58:09.785
- Bullshit.

58:13.790 --> 58:16.158
- I've been promised immunity.

58:18.528 --> 58:21.663
- We all change,
there is no immunity.

58:21.665 --> 58:22.665
- Wrong!

58:23.834 --> 58:27.603
When we ingest their blood,
we ingest the answer.

58:27.605 --> 58:29.004
- You're just
eating rotten meat.

58:29.006 --> 58:30.006
- Wrong!

58:40.250 --> 58:41.250
- Listen.

58:44.854 --> 58:48.056
They die just like you and me.

58:48.058 --> 58:50.959
You know this.
You've killed them.

58:53.129 --> 58:54.129
See?

58:56.165 --> 58:58.033
They're not undead.

58:58.935 --> 59:00.068
Only changed.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.170
Their minds gone.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.974
- Your mind is gone.

59:09.879 --> 59:12.047
- I don't wish to kill you,

59:12.049 --> 59:13.049
I need you.

59:15.618 --> 59:16.585
You could make my hunters

59:16.587 --> 59:17.886
with such

59:17.888 --> 59:18.987
great

59:20.590 --> 59:21.990
results.

59:27.030 --> 59:28.797
- Matra! Matra!

59:28.799 --> 59:29.865
- I'm here.

59:31.868 --> 59:34.102
- I got another for the war.

59:34.104 --> 59:35.104
A runner.

59:39.108 --> 59:40.776
- Think about it.

59:56.659 --> 59:58.126
She'll do nicely.

59:59.095 --> 01:00:01.229
Throw her in the cage.

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:04.032
Don't let her get
too close to him.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.195
- Looks like you've
found yourself a good

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:34.197
- shut up.

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:40.102
- Look, have you seen two girls.

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:41.104
Roughly 13.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:49.645
- Ruby?!

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:52.114
Ruby!

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:54.116
Ruby.

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:03.291
And Bella?

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.300
Damn it!

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:13.735
They've been missing
for two weeks,

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:15.170
I've been out looking for them.

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:37.159
- Already tried.

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:43.999
- Yeah but the both of us.

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:48.737
- Maybe.

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:52.107
But they're always watching.

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:58.847
- When the time is right.

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.260
- There you are,
my little warrior.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.063
Your lines of
power are in place.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.445
Breathe in.

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:07.983
Breathe in your invincibility.

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:20.262
Here you are, my warriors.

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:22.464
Now, you are ready for battle.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:25.200
Show me your war stance.

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:26.301
Good.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:28.036
Good.

01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:30.438
You will be fierce, each
and every one of you.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.339
Now, go!

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:32.474
Practice war!

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:40.015
Remember, you are invincible!

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:05.106
- Hey.

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:09.945
You know she's crazy, right?

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:15.283
She's gonna get you killed.

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:24.426
Are you listening to me?!

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.162
Go on, do it!

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:30.165
Get off of me.

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:31.165
- Knock it off.

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:35.070
You keep this up and we
won't be able to escape.

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:40.942
- Why should I help you?

01:04:40.944 --> 01:04:44.012
- You need me as
much as I need you.

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:07.469
- Where is your rescue party?

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:10.205
- I was it.

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:13.475
We can't spare anymore people.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:17.112
- Some camp.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:18.346
- Runners die.

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:20.015
It's part of the job.

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:23.418
We can't risk losing
more to save a few.

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:27.689
- What about for kids?

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:33.161
- Everyone is just as
important as the next person.

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:35.063
That's how we survive.

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:39.501
- Until a corrupt few
think differently.

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:41.269
- Not in our camp.

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:44.005
Tommy keeps everyone in line.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:46.442
- Tommy.

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:51.246
Sounds like the
crazy bitch here.

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.086
- She's changing!

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:32.420
She's changing!

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:15.630
Her faith is weak.

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:17.365
We must consume her.

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:19.801
Feed with me family!

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:22.070
We will be children forever!

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.321
Alma demands more.

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:43.258
We eat her raw.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:05.647
- Now's our chance.

01:08:18.737 --> 01:08:20.595
- This way. We can lose them...

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:23.631
- I'm not leaving
without my brother.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:25.300
- Oh, okay.

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:26.782
If we take from the
shadows, we can...

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.173
- Todd?

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:34.209
It's time to wake up.

01:08:55.363 --> 01:08:56.497
- He's awake!

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:04.506
- Benny?

01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:16.283
- Look at me, my child.

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:17.819
I am your Matra.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.420
We are your family now.

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:21.488
He means nothing to you.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.192
- Benny don't listen to her...

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:25.292
- silence!

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:29.697
Step back into formation!

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:34.301
You have a broken mind.

01:09:34.304 --> 01:09:37.738
There are only two things
to do to a broken mind.

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:40.441
Break it into submission

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:41.676
or destroy it.

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.484
You may begin.

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:02.557
Finish it!

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:05.727
Finish him.

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:12.000
There must be a winner.

01:11:12.002 --> 01:11:14.435
Finish it or you both die.

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:18.806
Finish it!

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:23.044
Finish it!

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:38.893
Finish it!

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:20.568
Get them!

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:31.679
- Benny!

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:32.714
It's me.

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:33.948
- Everyone stay where you are!

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:36.651
- Benny, don't listen to her.

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:42.824
- Your darn fine idea.

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:44.092
- Benny, it's me.

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:49.530
- He's mine. My loyal warrior.

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:54.402
- Benny.

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:56.938
Benny, look.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.375
I got you something.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.980
It's for you.

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:07.148
- Put that down!

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:09.050
You carry a spear now!

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:12.854
I said put that down.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:18.092
Defiance has a
punishment around here.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:19.094
- Todd!

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.971
- How dare you defy your Matra?

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:33.808
- Todd!

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:11.579
- But we were supposed
to live together forever.

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:12.573
- No, no, no. We
need to keep moving.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:15.776
- You spoke.

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:16.944
You spoke!

01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:18.880
- I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I'm sor...

01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:20.781
- no, it's okay!

01:15:20.783 --> 01:15:21.849
It's alright.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:22.950
It's okay.

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:29.056
It's okay.

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.026
I'm here.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:35.296
Everything's gonna be okay now.

01:15:35.298 --> 01:15:39.634
Listen, I know you wanna
be with those other kids

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:42.003
but we don't belong there.

01:15:42.005 --> 01:15:43.738
- I know.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:44.740
- Yeah?

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:46.941
- Not all places are like that.

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:48.676
Good ones exist.

01:15:48.678 --> 01:15:49.911
Like our camp.

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:53.848
Now what?

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:57.985
What'd I say this time?

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:12.099
I take it, you're
not coming with me?

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:15.336
Well...

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.176
- Todd.

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:23.178
- Eve.

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.914
This belongs to you.

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:40.661
I'll see you around.

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:54.742
- Alright, time to go.

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.946
You wanna piggyback?

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:00.047
Yeah?

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.283
Come on.

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:05.987
Hey.

01:17:05.989 --> 01:17:07.088
Say my name again.

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:08.823
- Todd.

01:17:08.825 --> 01:17:09.657
- Again.

01:17:09.659 --> 01:17:10.291
- Todd!

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:11.125
- Again!

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:11.959
- Todd!

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:12.994
- Again!

01:17:12.996 --> 01:17:13.828
- Todd!

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:14.662
- Again!

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:15.296
- Todd!

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:16.298
- Whoo!
