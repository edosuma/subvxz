Captioning funded by CBS
>> PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER"!

00:04.738 --> 00:08.876
WITH THREE POWER PAIRS LEFT IN
THE GAME, PAUL SECRETLY ALIGNED

00:08.909 --> 00:11.112
HIMSELF WITH EACH ONE.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.514
>> THREE'S A CROWD.

00:13.547 --> 00:19.120
I'M LIKE WATCHING MY CHILDREN
GROW.

00:19.153 --> 00:23.524
>> IT'S A TEAM EFFORT.
>> I'M BECOMING A THIRD WITH

00:23.557 --> 00:28.262
EACH PAIR SO THEY CAN RELY ON ME
TOWARDS THE END OF THE GAME.

00:28.296 --> 00:31.932
>> AND NEW TWISTS INSIDE THE
HOUSE.

00:31.965 --> 00:35.936
>> WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

00:35.969 --> 00:40.674
>> FIVE APPLES ARE ON THE TREE.

00:40.708 --> 00:45.012
YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE
POWERFUL OR PUNISHMENT.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.749
>> AND I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS
IN THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.685
MAYBE I CAN USE THIS TO MY
ADVANTAGE MOVING FORWARD.

00:51.719 --> 00:56.557
>> MARK USED HIS POWER TO TRY TO
GAIN FAVOR WITH PAUL.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.026
>> PAUL YOU GAVE ME FRIENDSHIP
FOR WEEK ONE.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.029
LEAST THING I CAN DO IS GAVE YOU
SAFETY.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.899
>> THANK YOU.
>> BUT IT DIDN'T CHANGE HIS FATE

01:05.933 --> 01:09.470
IN THE NAME.
>> MARK I NOMINATE YOU FOR

01:09.503 --> 01:11.472
REPLACEMENT.
>> MARK IS GOING TO GET

01:11.505 --> 01:12.873
BACK-DOORED AND SENT OUT.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.943
NOW I HAVE TO PUT MY PLAN IN
MOTION.

01:15.976 --> 01:20.914
>> PAUL INSTIGATED THE THREE
DUOS GOING TO WAR WITH EACH

01:20.948 --> 01:23.117
OTHER.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.052
>> YOU ARE THE STRONGEST DUO.

01:25.085 --> 01:30.324
>> WE NEED TO SEPARATE THAT AS
QUICK AS WE CAN.

01:30.358 --> 01:38.366
>> YOU NEED TO LAY LOW.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.000
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

01:40.033 --> 01:46.540
>> AT THE LIVE EVICTION, JALEX
HAD A SURPRISING VOTE.

01:46.574 --> 01:52.146
>> I VOTE TO EVICT MAT.
>> BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO SAVE

01:52.180 --> 01:56.116
MARK.
>> BY A VOTE OF 4-2, MARK, YOU

01:56.150 --> 01:57.985
ARE EVICTED FROM THE "BIG
BROTHER" HOUSE.

01:58.018 --> 02:02.923
>> WITH ONLY EIGHT HOUSE GUESTS
REMAINING, THE BATTLE FOR POWER

02:02.956 --> 02:04.158
BEGAN.

02:04.192 --> 02:07.161
TONIGHT WHO WILL CUT THE MUSTARD
AND BECOME HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD?

02:07.195 --> 02:11.965
AND WHICH COUPLE WILL BE FIRST
IN THE LINE OF FIRE?

02:11.999 --> 02:15.002
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

03:01.282 --> 03:05.919
>> THE GROUNDS CREW HAS A LITTLE
WORK TO DO.

03:05.953 --> 03:14.061
>> I HATE THAT!
>> OH, GOSH!

03:14.094 --> 03:18.466
>> WHY DID I PUT GEL IN MY HAIR?

03:18.499 --> 03:21.302
>> HERE'S MY CLOWN MAKEUP FOR
YOU.

03:21.335 --> 03:25.038
>> CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER, HOW
GUEST

03:25.072 --> 03:36.116
GUESTS.

03:36.149 --> 03:40.053
>> GUYS, THIS IS BRUTAL.

03:40.087 --> 03:43.657
THIS IS RUTHLESS.
>> FINALLY, WE GOT RID OF THE

03:43.691 --> 03:44.892
LAST MEATBALL.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.093
IT'S MARK E. MARK.

03:46.126 --> 03:50.097
THE HOUSE HAS BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW.

03:50.130 --> 03:53.066
NOW WE ALL HAVE TO TURN ON EACH
OTHER.

03:53.100 --> 03:57.571
MY GIRL, CHRISTMAS, CAN'T
COMPETE SO ME OR PAUL HAVE TO

03:57.605 --> 04:01.275
WIN THE HOH.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.577
>> ARE YOU ON THE END, MATT?

04:03.611 --> 04:04.478
>> YEAH.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.480
>> HOW IS IT GO SOMETHING.
>> GOING, BUD.

04:06.514 --> 04:09.417
>> I JUST SURVIVED THE BLOCK
ONCE AGAIN THIS WEEK.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.884
IT WAS A 4-2 VOTE.

04:10.918 --> 04:15.556
IF YOU'RE TRULY A PAWN, THERE
SHOULDN'T BE ANY VOTES AGAINST

04:15.589 --> 04:16.657
YOU.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.260
SO MYSELF OR PAUL HAVE TO WIN
THE HOH SO WE CAN START

04:20.294 --> 04:25.265
EXECUTING WHAT WE WANT TO DO,
WHICH IS SPLITTING UP JASON AND

04:25.299 --> 04:26.500
ALEX.

04:26.534 --> 04:29.737
>> BEFORE WE GO TO THE VOTE,
JASON, PAUL AND I GOT TOGETHER

04:29.770 --> 04:35.943
AND DECIDED TO THROW A ROGUE
VOTE TOWARDS MATT AND PIN IT ON

04:35.976 --> 04:38.045
KEVIN.

04:38.078 --> 04:44.318
HOPEFULLY HE GETS TARGETED FOR
THE HOH.

04:44.352 --> 04:48.221
>> JASON WAS GOING TO BE THE ONE
ROGUE VOTE.

04:48.255 --> 04:51.659
>> I VOTE TO EVICT MATT.

04:51.692 --> 04:56.029
>> BUT WHEN I WENT TO CAST MY
VOTE, MY MIND WENT BLACK AND I

04:56.063 --> 04:57.431
VOTED FOR MATT TO GO HOME, TOO.

04:57.465 --> 05:02.035
>> I VOTE TO EVICT MATT.

05:02.069 --> 05:07.307
>> SO ME, JASON OR PAUL HAS TO
WIN THIS HOH.

05:07.341 --> 05:12.646
IF SOMEBODY GOES ON A WITCH HUNT
FOR THE ROGUE VOTES AND WHO CAST

05:12.680 --> 05:14.014
THEM.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.516
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

05:15.549 --> 05:22.390
>> LOOK AT ALEX.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.524
>> I HAVE GOOP IN MY EAR.

05:23.557 --> 05:26.594
>> I'M A GOOD POSITION WITH ALL
THE DUOS RIGHT NOW.

05:26.627 --> 05:30.130
I'M DEBATING WHETHER I WANT TO
WIN THE HOH OR NOT.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.366
IF I WIN, I'LL HAVE TO SHOW MY
CARDS.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.936
IF I LOSE, I MIGHT BE A TARGET.

05:35.969 --> 05:41.675
FOR NOW, THIS WIENER WILL HOLD
ON TO HIS BUN AND SEE HOW THIS

05:41.709 --> 05:43.377
PLAYS OUT.

05:43.411 --> 05:49.082
>> AT LEAST WE GOT A NICE WIDE
PLATFORM TO STAND ON.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.519
>> GREAT BUNS, LADIES.

05:51.552 --> 05:58.258
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO HOLD ON TO THIS HOT DOG

05:58.291 --> 05:59.393
BUN.

05:59.427 --> 06:05.666
AS IF THAT WASN'T HARD ENOUGH,
THE WALL STARTS TO TIP.

06:05.699 --> 06:14.074
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT,
YA'LL.

06:14.107 --> 06:19.780
>> GOING INTO THIS HOH, I'M
GOING TO PREPARE, TRY AS HARD AS

06:19.813 --> 06:20.748
I CAN.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.650
OH, MAN!
>> WHAT THE HELL?

06:22.683 --> 06:26.654
>> KEVIN, JUST GO PUT YOUR HEAD
IN THE TOILET.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.490
>> I'M THE FIRST ONE DOWN IN THE
HOH.

06:29.523 --> 06:35.696
>> KEVIN, WHAT THE --
>> NOW I'M HOPING JASON, ALEX OR

06:35.729 --> 06:37.698
PAUL CAN PULL IT OUT.

06:37.731 --> 06:42.069
EVERYTHING WILL BE SMOOTH,
SMOOTH SAILING.

06:42.102 --> 06:46.106
>> MY FEET HURT SO BAD.
>> AFTER COOKING 100 WIENERS, I

06:46.139 --> 06:49.109
SAID NO MORE WIENERS.

06:49.142 --> 06:53.246
NOW I'M A WIENER.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.316
WHEN THE BUNS GO FORWARD, I'M
REALLY STRUGGLING.

06:56.349 --> 07:01.689
IT'S SLIPPERY BECAUSE OF ALL
THESE CONDIMENTS.

07:01.722 --> 07:06.026
I DON'T LIKE, THIS.
>> SO I KNOW THIS WILL BE A

07:06.059 --> 07:07.861
PRETTY LENGTHY ENDURANCE COMP.

07:07.895 --> 07:11.832
I WANT TO REST MY ARMS AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.266
>> AND MATT IS OUT.

07:13.300 --> 07:17.838
>> I PUT MY HANDS DOWN TO REST
FOR A SPLIT SECOND.

07:17.871 --> 07:25.045
I REACH OUT TO GRAB A PUG AND I
FLIP AND FALL DIRECTLY OUT OF MY

07:25.078 --> 07:26.246
BUN.

07:26.279 --> 07:30.784
SO I'M HOPING PAUL CAN PULL THIS
OUT AND WE CAN GET ALEX AND

07:30.818 --> 07:32.886
JASON OUT OF THE GAME THIS WEEK.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.923
>> COME ON, MATT.

07:35.956 --> 07:36.256
REALLY?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.424
THAT FAST?

07:37.457 --> 07:40.393
>> ONE OF MY TARGETS IS DOWN AND
OUT.

07:40.427 --> 07:53.306
NOW WE NEED THE WIENER, RAVEN TO
SLIP OUT OF HER BUN AND SEE WHO

07:53.340 --> 07:54.808
WE CAN PUT ON THE BLOCK.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.176
>> I'M FREEZING COLD.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.111
I'M WET, I'M SOGGY.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.147
NOTHING LIKE A SOGGY WIENER.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.350
I HAVE KETCHUP ALL OVER ME.

08:03.383 --> 08:07.487
THESE CAN'T GET ANY WORSE.

08:07.521 --> 08:13.493
>> OH!
>> AND I SPOKE TOO SOON.

08:13.527 --> 08:20.834
>> YEAH!
>> I'M REALLY GREEN WITH ENVY

08:20.868 --> 08:21.835
RIGHT NOW.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.437
>> ALMOST BOTCHED IT.

08:24.471 --> 08:36.984
>> YEP.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.987
>> I'M AT A CRAZY ANGLE.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.991
THE KETCHUP AND MUSTARD ARE ALL
OVER ME.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.994
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE MY FOOT AT
ALL.

08:47.027 --> 08:51.765
IF I MOVE, GET THAT GOOP UNDER
THEM, I'M SLIPPING OFF.

08:51.799 --> 08:55.268
>> I'M ALL SAUCED UP WITH ALL
THE TOPPING, THIS THING START

08:55.302 --> 09:07.314
TIPPING, IMPAIR -- I'M PARALLEL
TO THE GROUND.

09:07.347 --> 09:12.419
>> AND JOSH IS THE NEXT WIENER
OFF THE GRILL.

09:12.452 --> 09:13.954
>> JOSH IS OUT.

09:13.987 --> 09:20.994
NOW ALL OF OUR HOPE IS ON PAUL
TO PULL OUT A WIN FOR US.

09:21.028 --> 09:26.734
>> IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DOWN TO
ALEX, JASON, PAUL AND RAVEN.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.903
>> SO I'M SLIPPING AND SLIDING
ON THE WALL.

09:29.937 --> 09:33.006
I CAN'T FIND A GOOD GRIP TO SAVE
MY LIFE.

09:33.040 --> 09:38.411
ALL OF THE CONDIMENTS ARE MAKING
A HUGE SLIPPERY SLOPE AND I'M

09:38.445 --> 09:48.722
ABOUT TO EAT CRAP.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.958
>> YES, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I
NEED.

09:50.991 --> 09:55.362
IT LOOKS LIKE A PUNISHMENT BUT
THIS WATER IS GREAT.

09:55.395 --> 10:01.769
I START WASHING MY HANDS AND ARM
HOLDS TO GET A BETTER GRIP.

10:01.802 --> 10:05.673
IT DOES WORK.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.541
>> THAT WAS REFRESHING.

10:08.575 --> 10:11.679
>> HERE WE GO AGAIN.

10:11.712 --> 10:15.148
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.718
HOLD ON TIGHT.

10:17.751 --> 10:18.719
>> WHAT GO GUYS WANT?

10:18.752 --> 10:19.853
>> I WANT TO WIN.

10:19.887 --> 10:28.028
>> I DO, TOO.

10:28.061 --> 10:31.398
COME ON!
>> RAVEN WANTS TO CUT A DEAL

10:31.431 --> 10:33.166
WHILE WE'RE ON THE WALL.

10:33.200 --> 10:33.967
REALLY?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.135
THERE'S NO WAY I'M CUTTING A
DEAL.

10:35.168 --> 10:39.272
IF I WANT TO WIN HOH, I'M
PUTTING YOU AND YOUR BOYFRIEND

10:39.306 --> 10:40.540
ON THE BLOCK.

10:40.573 --> 10:44.945
RAVEN, YOU WANT THIS HOH, YOU
BETTER HOLD ON TIGHT.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.814
>> IT'S A GOOD FEELING.

10:46.847 --> 10:52.285
>> SO DOWN TO RAVEN, PAUL, ALEX
AND JASON AND I'M HOPING THAT

10:52.319 --> 10:55.355
RAVEN OR PAUL CAN PULL THIS OFF
SO THAT WE CAN GAIN CONTROL OF

10:55.388 --> 10:57.791
THE HOUSE THIS WEEK.

10:57.825 --> 11:03.797
COME ON, GUYS.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.305
>> HERE WE GO AGAIN.

11:12.339 --> 11:16.243
>> IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DOWN TO
ALEX, JASON, PAUL AND RAVEN.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.911
>> WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT?

11:17.945 --> 11:21.514
>> I WANT TO WIN!
>> I DO, TOO.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.416
COME ON.

11:23.450 --> 11:30.457
>> I REALLY WANT A LETTER, GUY.

11:30.490 --> 11:35.863
>> RAVEN IS OVER HERE YAMMERRING
ABOUT MAKING A DEAL.

11:35.896 --> 11:39.032
I'M PRETTY SURE JASON AND ALEX
ARE NOT MAKING DEALS.

11:39.066 --> 11:43.737
AT THIS POINT, I DON'T CARE WHO
WINS HOH.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.605
WHOEVER WINS, JUST REMEMBER THE
PLAN.

11:45.638 --> 11:50.911
TO TAKE A SHOT AT THE OTHER
PAIR.

11:50.944 --> 11:55.916
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING
ME RIGHT NOW.

11:55.949 --> 12:00.287
SO I HAVE TO SELL THIS FALL AND
CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT I BOTCHED

12:00.320 --> 12:01.088
IT.

12:01.121 --> 12:11.231
>> OH, WHAT IN THE NAME --
>> WHY!

12:11.264 --> 12:18.338
I BOTCHED THAT ONE, GUYS.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.406
GOOD JOB, RAVEN.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.373
WE BLEW IT.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.710
>> I'M OUT, PAUL IS OUT AND
RAVEN IS OUT, TOO.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.980
OUR CHANCES FOR POWER ARE OUT
THE WINDOW THIS WEEK.

12:27.014 --> 12:33.954
I'M JUST HOPING THAT JASON AND
ALEX DECIDE NOT TO COME AFTER

12:33.987 --> 12:39.759
US.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.194
>> JASON, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:41.228 --> 12:44.697
>> I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
ALEX.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.433
>> YOU'RE GOING DOWN HONESTLY.

12:46.466 --> 12:51.238
>> I WANT TO BE HOH.

12:51.271 --> 12:56.609
>> AT THIS POINT, I'M COLD, I'M
UPSET AND I DON'T KNOW WHY JASON

12:56.643 --> 12:58.311
OR ALEX ISN'T DROPPING.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.849
IT'S LIKE RUBBING SALT IN THE
WOUND TO ME.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.516
COME ON, GUYS.

13:03.550 --> 13:09.189
>> I'M DOING PRETTY DAMN GOOD,
ALEX.

13:09.222 --> 13:13.160
>> I CAN TAKE ME A NAP.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.163
>> I'M COLD, JASON.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.730
>> THEN JUMP OFF.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.067
>> GIVE ME SOMETHING.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.035
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

13:22.069 --> 13:27.474
>> HOW ABOUT YOU RUB MY BACK FOR
48 HOURS STRAIGHT.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.177
>> I'M NOT GIVING YOU SOMETHING
IF YOU WIN.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.046
>> THIS IS REALLY BIZARRE.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.648
ARE YOU EACH OTHER'S RIGHT OR
DIE?

13:35.682 --> 13:40.720
ARE YOU HAVING A WIENEY
COMPETITION?

13:40.753 --> 13:42.522
YOU'RE JUST SHOWING HOW STRONG
YOU ARE.

13:42.555 --> 13:47.427
YOU WANT TO KEEP FLEXING ON
THESE HOUSE GUESTS?

13:47.460 --> 13:48.695
BE MY GUEST.

13:48.728 --> 13:52.032
YOU'RE NOT MAKING A GOOD CASE
FOR YOURSELVES.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.801
>> SAFETY AND A JURY VOTE.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.670
>> SUCK IT.
>> EVEN THOUGH JASON IS MY RIGHT

13:57.704 --> 14:01.909
OR DIE, I HOPE THIS SHOWS THAT
WE'RE NOT AS CLOSE AS PEOPLE

14:01.942 --> 14:05.545
THINK WE ARE.

14:05.578 --> 14:06.379
>> HOLD ON.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.614
WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

14:07.647 --> 14:08.681
>> SHE'S GOING DOWN.

14:08.715 --> 14:09.950
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

14:09.983 --> 14:11.584
IT'S THE TWO OF YOU WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.520
>> I WANT MY THIRD HOH.

14:13.553 --> 14:17.724
>> SHE'S TRYING TO BACK DOOR ME,
MATT.

14:17.757 --> 14:21.861
>> GIVE IT TO ONE OF THEM.

14:21.895 --> 14:31.604
>> RAVEN IS SHIVERING AND CRYING
AND THEY'RE HAVING SOME SORT OF

14:31.638 --> 14:33.773
NONNEGOTIATION WHEN THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE EACH OTHER'S

14:33.806 --> 14:34.641
ALLIES.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.243
I'M ANNOYED ABOUT THESE TWO
ROGUE VOTES.

14:36.276 --> 14:42.649
SO TO WATCH THEM STAMMERING
AROUND DOING NOTHING, I'M BEYOND

14:42.682 --> 14:43.383
ANNOYED AT THIS.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.617
>> OH, I THREW IT.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.787
>> YOU CAN STAND THERE TILL YOU
TURN PURPLE.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.657
ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?

14:50.690 --> 14:51.191
STOP.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.492
>> COME ON.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.760
LET'S GO.

14:53.793 --> 15:03.903
>> I GOT MATT RUNNING HIS YAPPER
OVER HERE AND ALEX RUNNING HER

15:03.903 --> 15:08.942
>> I GOT MATT RUNNING HIS YAPPER
OVER HERE AND ALEX RUNNING HER

15:08.976 --> 15:10.410
YA
YAPPER.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.945
ALEX, I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL
YOU'RE DOWN.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.747
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT, JASON?

15:14.781 --> 15:21.654
>> I THINK WE'RE ALL PRETTY
CONFUSED AT THIS POINT.

15:21.688 --> 15:25.358
CAN WE GO INSIDE AND EAT PIZZA?

15:25.392 --> 15:28.028
WOW!
>> THIS IS SHADY STUFF, GUYS.

15:28.061 --> 15:31.664
>> SO MATT FINALLY SHOWED UP TO
"BIG BROTHER."

15:31.698 --> 15:34.401
NOW HE HAS A VOICE?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.368
I'M SHOCKED.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.705
HOMEY HASN'T SAID A WORD IN
60-SOMETHING DAYS.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.108
I DIDN'T KNOW THE KID COULD
YELL.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.176
I'M LOVING LIFE.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.513
THIS IS PAINTING A BIGGER TARGET
ON HIS BACK.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.316
THAT MEANS ME AND MY GIRL,
CHRISTMAS, MIGHT BE GOOD THIS

15:49.349 --> 15:49.849
WEEK.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.419
>> WHAT IS HAPPENING?

15:52.452 --> 15:53.286
>> I DON'T KNOW.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.088
I KNOW I JUST GOT TWO VOTES
AGAINST ME.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.624
>> IT WASN'T ME.

15:57.657 --> 15:58.691
>> IT WASN'T ME.

15:58.725 --> 16:05.032
>> PAUL --
>> KEVIN, WHY ARE YOU PREACHING

16:05.065 --> 16:05.832
HERE?

16:05.865 --> 16:07.434
>> TWO PEOPLE VOTED TO EVICT
MATT.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.737
SO I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE WAS
TRYING TO PUT IT ON ME.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.572
PEOPLE WONDER, GET PARANOID.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.974
>> THEY KNOW WHY THEY'RE VOTING
MARK.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.643
EVERYBODY IN AMERICA KNOWS.

16:16.676 --> 16:22.515
ONLY TWO PEOPLE DIDN'T HOPING
THEY WOULD GET MAD AT ME.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.617
CONNIVING-TYPE STUFF.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.854
>> I'M SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.858
>> I'M ASKING YOU FOR SAFETY.

16:31.891 --> 16:32.892
WHAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

16:32.925 --> 16:35.962
>> WHY DO YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM
FOR THAT?

16:35.995 --> 16:38.765
>> I'M NOT SURE.
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:38.798 --> 16:40.933
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:40.967 --> 16:45.372
>> I'M ASKING YOU FOR SAFETY.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.507
JUST --
>> FALL.

16:47.540 --> 16:58.151
>> NO.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.952
>> SAFETY?

16:59.986 --> 17:01.321
>> OKAY.

17:01.354 --> 17:01.854
BYE.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.657
>> I LOVE YOU, JASON.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.259
>> YEAH, ME, TOO.

17:06.293 --> 17:09.229
>> CONGRATULATIONS, JASON.

17:09.262 --> 17:16.269
YOU'RE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

17:16.303 --> 17:20.240
>> YEAH, ANOTHER FEATHER IN MY
HAT.

17:20.273 --> 17:23.009
>> THE LAST HOH WAS SHORT LIVED.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.979
NOW I GET TO RUN THE ROOM FOR
SEVEN DAYS.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.315
I CAN'T WAIT.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.484
JASON WINS AND THIS IS PERFECT.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.154
STEP ONE, SOMEBODY FROM THE
PAIRS WON THE HOH.

17:34.187 --> 17:37.056
NOW I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
STEP TWO GOES THROUGH AND JASON

17:37.090 --> 17:41.094
TAKES A SHOT AT MATT AND RAVEN.

17:41.128 --> 17:44.397
>> JASON WINS THE HOH.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.400
THIS IS A WORSE CASE SCENARIO.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.136
I LOVE THE GUY.

17:49.169 --> 17:52.405
HE'S ONE OF THE STRONGEST MALE
COMPETITORS IN THE HOUSE.

17:52.439 --> 17:56.676
HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONVINCE JASON
TO TAKE A SHOT FOR US AND NOT

17:56.709 --> 17:57.444
AGAINST US.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.446
>> JASON WINS HOH.

17:59.479 --> 18:00.747
NOT WHAT WE WANTED TO HAPPEN.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.682
IT'S GETTING DOWN TO THE WIRE.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.552
EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT
FOR ALEX IS GOING TO BE AT RISK

18:05.585 --> 18:06.919
OF GOING HOME THIS WEEK.

18:06.953 --> 18:11.958
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE IN FOR ONE
CRAZY WEEK TO SAY THE LEAST.

18:26.173 --> 18:29.742
>> AND THEN THERE WAS EIGHT.
>> SAVED MY LIFE.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.280
>> YEAH!
>> GOOD ONE.

18:33.313 --> 18:39.619
>> THAT'S SO WEIRD!
>> THAT IS WEIRD!

18:39.652 --> 18:46.359
>> WEIRD.

18:46.393 --> 18:51.097
>> AND BOOM!
HOH, VIRTUALLY BACK-TO-BACK.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.566
THE LAST HOH WAS SHORT-LIVED.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.033
WHO?

18:54.066 --> 18:55.001
FIVE HOURS?

18:55.034 --> 18:58.037
NOW I GET TO PUT MATT AND RAVEN
ON THE BLOCK.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.739
THEY'RE A DUO.

18:59.772 --> 19:04.477
WE DON'T NEED THEM AS A NUMBER
ANYMORE.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.180
ALEX AND I HAVE THE DUO THING
COVERED.

19:07.214 --> 19:14.721
I'LL SEAL THE DEAL ON THE LAST
SET OF BROMANCES.

19:14.754 --> 19:19.459
>> I'VE BEEN TELLING THEM THEY
NEED TO TARGET MATT AND RAVEN.

19:19.492 --> 19:23.062
SO JASON TAKES A SHOT AND I
DON'T GET ANY BLOOD ON MY HANDS.

19:23.095 --> 19:26.833
>> JASON WINS HOH AND IT'S
TOUGH.

19:26.866 --> 19:31.238
BECAUSE YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.

19:31.271 --> 19:34.040
I DID HAVE TWO VOTES AGAINST ME.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.108
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY CAME
FROM AT THIS POINT.

19:36.142 --> 19:41.047
>> I'M JUST HOPING THAT HE MAKES
A BIG MOVE AND GOES AFTER KEVIN.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.416
>> HOW DID THEY DO THAT?

19:43.450 --> 19:44.817
>> HOW DID THEY DO WHAT?

19:44.851 --> 19:54.894
TOOK OUT THE BIG ONE AND PUT ON
A LITTLE ONE.

19:54.894 --> 20:02.569
TOOK OUT THE BIG ONE AND PUT ON
A LITTLE ONE.

20:02.602 --> 20:07.340
>> HOPEFULLY MATTHEW AND I ARE
OKAY AT THIS MOMENT.

20:07.374 --> 20:14.714
THE LAST PEOPLE LEFT THE HOUSE
HAD SHOMAMCES.

20:14.747 --> 20:24.791
SO THIS STREAK NEEDS TO END NOW?

20:24.791 --> 20:31.864
SO THIS STREAK NEEDS TO END NOW?

20:31.898 --> 20:35.768
HE STARTED SPASMING AT PAUL.

20:35.802 --> 20:43.075
>> KEVIN, WHY ARE YOU PREACHING?

20:43.109 --> 20:45.512
>> IT'S SO ANNOYING.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.781
KEVIN, RELAX.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.318
>> THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS
HAS HAPPENED.

20:51.351 --> 20:54.153
NO, SERIOUSLY.

20:54.186 --> 20:57.624
>> I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.859
>> THIS IS AMAZING.

20:59.892 --> 21:03.430
OUR PLAN FOR THE ROGUE VOTE WAS
TO PUT IT ON KEVIN.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.999
JOSH WAS TELLING ME THE VOGUE
VOTE WAS KEVIN.

21:07.033 --> 21:11.871
I SEE RAVEN LISTENING TO OUR
CONVERSATION THIS IS A GREAT

21:11.904 --> 21:16.275
OPPORTUNITY TO CAST BLAME ON MAT
AND KEVIN SO THEY HAVE A FALSE

21:16.309 --> 21:19.278
SENSE OF SECURITY.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.848
>> NO, HE KNOWS.

21:21.881 --> 21:26.285
>> AS LONG AS JASON AND I DON'T
ADMIT TO ANYONE THAT WE WERE THE

21:26.319 --> 21:36.363
TWO ROGUE VOTES, EVERYTHING
SHOULD BE A-OKAY.

21:36.363 --> 21:51.143
TWO ROGUE VOTES, EVERYTHING
SHOULD BE A-OKAY.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.845
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.682
IF YOU ASKED ME, I WOULD HAVE
VOTED FOR HIM.

21:55.715 --> 21:56.916
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME?

21:56.949 --> 22:01.020
YOU WANTED ME TO DO IT RIGHT
THERE SO EVERYTHING IS PLANNED?

22:01.053 --> 22:03.890
>> ONLY AT THE LAST SECOND.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.359
>> ACT LIKE YOU KNOW.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.960
JUST ACT LIKE YOU KNOW.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.663
>> I'M NOT A VERY GOOD LIAR.

22:10.697 --> 22:18.771
I CAN'T -- WHEN I GET CORNERED,
I JUST -- I GET DIARRHEA OF THE

22:18.805 --> 22:19.105
MOUTH.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.240
IT'S OKAY.

22:21.273 --> 22:21.941
IT'S OKAY.

22:21.974 --> 22:29.516
>> YEAH.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.216
>> HEY.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.985
ANY IDEA ABOUT THOSE TWO VOTES?

22:33.019 --> 22:35.688
>> ONE OF THEM IS OBVIOUSLY HIM.

22:35.722 --> 22:40.326
>> THERE'S A CONSENSUS ROGUE
VOTE IN THE HOUSE.

22:40.359 --> 22:44.731
>> HE'S BEEN DOING IT THE WHOLE
SEASON.

22:44.764 --> 22:54.807
>> KEVIN IS FULL OF -- IT'S
ANNOYING.

22:54.807 --> 23:04.884
>> KEVIN IS FULL OF -- IT'S
ANNOYING.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.266
.
>> SO THE LAST FEW WEEKS, KEVIN

23:20.299 --> 23:22.669
HAS BEEN ACTING EXTREMELY
STRANGE.

23:22.702 --> 23:25.371
VERY SUSPECT AND SUSPICIOUS TO
SAY THE LEAST.

23:25.404 --> 23:29.175
AND WE'RE PRETTY SURE THAT KEVIN
HAS BEEN THE ROGUE VOTE IN

23:29.208 --> 23:30.777
MULTIPLE VOTES THIS SEASON.

23:30.810 --> 23:34.146
SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT
JASON IS THINKING RIGHT NOW BUT

23:34.180 --> 23:39.719
I'M HOPING THAT HE KNOWS THAT
KEVIN IS A REALLY BIG TARGET.

23:39.752 --> 23:47.326
>> IF WE CAN JUST GET KEVIN ON
THE BLOCK.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.361
THEN WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

24:02.875 --> 24:13.686
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE JUST
SAI

24:13.720 --> 24:14.487
SAI
SAID.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.155
>> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE RAVEN TO
DEATH.

24:16.188 --> 24:19.091
I PROBABLY UNDERSTAND ABOUT 50%
OF THE THINGS SHE SAYS.

24:19.125 --> 24:23.930
IT'S KINDS OF A TRANSLATION
EXERCISE EVERY TIME SHE SAYS

24:23.963 --> 24:27.366
SOMETHING.

24:27.399 --> 24:32.705
>> BETWEEN HER MUMBLING --
>> IT'S SO RIDICULOUS.

24:32.739 --> 24:39.746
>> AND HER RIDICULOUS SOUTHERN
ACCENT.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.781
>> KEVIN WANTS TO WHAT?

25:01.634 --> 25:07.306
>> YOU REALLY SUCK AT TALKING.

25:07.339 --> 25:12.511
>> WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU SPEECH
CLASSES SO YOU CAN TALK SO GOOD.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.547
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.021
.
>> THIS IS PERFECT.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.889
EVERYTHING IS GOING ACCORDING TO
PLAN.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.357
EVERYBODY IS ON THE SAME PAGE.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.193
NOW I HAVE TO GO TALK TO MATT
AND RAVEN AND MAKE SURE THEY

26:01.227 --> 26:04.530
DON'T FREAK OUT IF THEY GET PUT
ON THE BLOCK AND MAKE THEM

26:04.563 --> 26:08.134
BELIEVE THERE'S ANOTHER PLAN IN
PLAY TO BACK DOOR KEVIN AND THAT

26:08.167 --> 26:09.468
NONE OF THEM ARE TARGET.

26:09.501 --> 26:19.545
WHEN IN REALITY, ONE OF THEM IS
A TARGET.

26:19.545 --> 26:29.555
WHEN IN REALITY, ONE OF THEM IS
A TARGET.

26:50.843 --> 26:54.814
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
THEY'RE SO CALM IN BUYING ALL OF

26:54.847 --> 26:56.348
THIS RIGHT NOW.

26:56.382 --> 27:01.954
EITHER I SUCK AND GETTING
SWINDLED, OR ARE THEY JUST THIS

27:01.988 --> 27:12.031
COMFORTABLE WITH ME?

27:12.031 --> 27:18.537
COMFORTABLE WITH ME?

27:20.707 --> 27:26.679
>> NOBODY CAN TALK ABOUT THE
VOTE EXCEPT ME, YOU AND PAUL.

27:26.713 --> 27:36.756
>> GOT IT.

27:36.756 --> 27:43.162
>> GOT IT.

27:58.310 --> 28:08.420
>> OH, MY GOD.

28:08.420 --> 28:14.593
>> OH, MY GOD.

28:14.626 --> 28:17.997
>> I PANICKED.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.231
JUST KEEP IT BETWEEN US.

28:19.265 --> 28:24.937
>> JASON, WHY DON'T YOU TELL THE
PERSON WE'RE TRYING TO FRAME

28:24.971 --> 28:27.974
WE'RE THE ROGUE VOTE?

28:28.007 --> 28:30.943
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

28:30.977 --> 28:35.147
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO AFTER
MATT AND RAVEN BUT NOW KEVIN

28:35.181 --> 28:37.183
COULD BE A LIABILITY TO OUR
GAME.

28:48.527 --> 28:49.528
>> WHO IS DOWN THERE?

28:49.561 --> 28:55.667
>> TWEEDLE DEE, TWEEDLE DUMB.

28:55.701 --> 29:02.508
>> RAVEN IS REALLY WEIRD.

29:02.541 --> 29:03.609
>> SHE'S LIKE BIZARRE.

29:03.642 --> 29:05.644
>> AND LYING ABOUT LITTLE STUFF.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.279
>> YEAH.

29:07.313 --> 29:08.781
SHE LIES A LOT.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.950
>> RAVEN TELL AS LOT OF STORIES.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.552
THEY'RE VERY UNBELIEVABLE.

29:13.585 --> 29:18.958
>> I THINK SHE'S A COMPULSIVE
LIAR.

29:18.991 --> 29:19.558
>> YES.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.660
>> LITERALLY UNBELIEVABLE.

29:21.693 --> 29:28.434
>> I'M HAVING -- FUN!
>> PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATE HOW FUN

29:28.467 --> 29:34.841
I AM.

29:34.874 --> 29:38.477
>> MY MOM HAS DEMENTIA.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.380
>> WHAT WAS YOUR GPA GRADUATING?

29:41.413 --> 29:41.914
>> DANCE.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.549
I TOOK BUSINESS, TOO.

29:43.582 --> 29:46.485
>> I CAN'T GO THROUGH A METAL
DETECTOR.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.420
>> WHAT ABOUT THUNDERSTORMS?

29:48.454 --> 29:50.923
>> MY MOM HAS BEEN STRUCK BY
LIGHTNING.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.959
>> WITH OR WITHOUT PACE MAKER?

29:52.992 --> 29:54.994
>> WITHOUT PACEMAKER.

29:55.027 --> 29:57.263
>> HOW DID YOUR MOM GET STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING?

29:57.296 --> 30:08.040
THAT'S LIKE SO FAR-FETCHED THAT
I HIGHLY DOUBT IT'S TRUE.

30:08.074 --> 30:08.707
INVERTED SPINE.

30:08.740 --> 30:09.976
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

30:10.009 --> 30:14.280
>> I HAVE ARTHRITIS IN MY BACK.
>> YOUR HEAD WOULD BE WITH YOUR

30:14.313 --> 30:18.650
LEGS ARE AND YOUR LEGS WOULD BE
WHERE YOUR HEAD IS.

30:18.684 --> 30:19.618
I DON'T GET IT.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.819
>> WHAT'S THE LEG THING?

30:20.853 --> 30:23.890
>> I HAD SURGERY ON MY RIGHT
KNEE.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.225
I NEED SURGERY AT EVERYTHING.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.360
I STOPPED GROWING WHILE I WAS
13.

30:28.394 --> 30:29.828
I WAS ITTY BITTY.

30:29.862 --> 30:32.464
>> MY MOM HOLDS THE RECORD IN
ARKANSAS.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.700
SHE RAN THE MILE IN 5 MINUTES
AND 50 SECONDS.

30:34.733 --> 30:35.767
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

30:35.801 --> 30:36.768
>> I KNOW.

30:36.802 --> 30:39.105
I WAS TRAINING FOR THE OLYMPICS.

30:39.138 --> 30:47.313
>> SO YOU'RE TELLING ME I'M
LIVING WITH A GIRL WHO IS

30:47.346 --> 30:55.521
TRAINING FOR THE OLYMPICS AND
HAS AN INVERTED SMILE WITH A BAD

30:55.554 --> 30:56.122
KNEE?

30:56.155 --> 30:58.457
ALL I WANT IS FRIENDSHIP.

30:58.490 --> 31:03.162
>> SHE'S A COMPULSIVE LIAR.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.332
>> BIZARRE.
>> LIKE HOW SHE SAID SHE LIKES

31:06.365 --> 31:08.734
MY BAND.

31:08.767 --> 31:10.769
>> THAT WAS A BIG STRETCH.

31:21.948 --> 31:31.991
>> THE TREE OF TEMPTATION HAS
SPRUNG TO LIFE ONCE AGAIN!

31:31.991 --> 31:37.196
>> THE TREE OF TEMPTATION HAS
SPRUNG TO LIFE ONCE AGAIN!

31:37.229 --> 31:40.832
>> SO THE TREE OF TEMPTATION
GOES RED AGAIN.

31:40.866 --> 31:42.368
WE GET TO PICK AN APPLE.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.737
YOU GET A PUNISHMENT OR A POWER.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.239
ELIMINATE TWO VOTES.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.040
COOL.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.942
CAN'T BLAME THE NEXT HOH, NOT
CHILD.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.444
BOUNTY OVER YOUR HEAD, NOT
CHILL.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.447
SECOND VETO, DON'T WANT ANY OF
THESE THINGS.

31:55.481 --> 31:59.585
ONE OF THESE APPLES CAN RUIN THE
PLAN FOR THE WEEK.

31:59.618 --> 32:00.719
>> SHOULD I GO FOR IT?

32:00.752 --> 32:01.720
>> NO, NO.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.323
>> SHE'S GOING TO GET AN APPLE.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.257
LOOK AT HER.

32:05.291 --> 32:09.628
>> SO THE PLAN TO BREAK UP MATT
AND RAVEN.

32:09.661 --> 32:14.300
HAVING TWO VETOES IN PLAY COULD
THROW A WRENCH IN THAT DEAL.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.336
IF THEY WIN VETO AND PULL
THEMSELVES OFF THE BLOCK, THEN I

32:17.369 --> 32:22.008
WILL DEFINITELY BE FORCED TO PUT
UP TWO OF MY PALS.

32:22.041 --> 32:22.975
THAT IS NOT COOL.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.810
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN NOW?

32:24.843 --> 32:27.179
>> SHE STILL WON'T TAKE IT.

32:27.213 --> 32:31.117
WHEN SHE GOES TO THE TREE, SHE
AUTOMATICALLY RETURNED IT.

32:31.150 --> 32:37.689
>> I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

32:37.723 --> 32:41.293
>> JASON CANNOT AFFORD MORE
SURPRISES.

32:41.327 --> 32:52.338
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE NOBODY
TAKES THE APPLE FROM THAT TREE.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.772
>> NOT GOOD.

32:53.805 --> 32:58.444
>> AT THIS POINT, I KNOW THAT
KEVIN IS THE BACK DOOR PLAN.

32:58.477 --> 33:02.581
BUT IF I WERE TO PICK AN APPLE
AND GET THE BOUNTY ON MY HEAD,

33:02.614 --> 33:10.089
THE TARGET COULD QUICKLY CHANGE
FROM KEVIN TO THIS GIRL.

33:10.122 --> 33:16.195
IT'S A HUGE GAMBLE.

33:16.228 --> 33:17.929
>> LOOK AT THE STUFF IS LEFT.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.531
>> CAN'T BE THE NEXT HOH.

33:19.565 --> 33:20.932
>> BOUNTY ON YOUR HEAD?

33:20.966 --> 33:25.804
>> IN THE POSITION I'M IN IN THE
GAME, THERE'S NO SET OF

33:25.837 --> 33:28.940
CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT NOW WHERE I
WOULD RISK PICKING AN APPLE FROM

33:28.974 --> 33:30.442
THE TREE OF TEMPTATION.

33:30.476 --> 33:36.115
THE PUNISHMENT FOR ME WOULD FAR
OUTWEIGH THE REWARDS, SO NOT

33:36.148 --> 33:42.088
SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO RISK.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.223
>> THANKS, MARK.

33:44.256 --> 33:54.300
>> OH, MY GOSH.

33:54.300 --> 33:59.871
>> OH, MY GOSH.

33:59.905 --> 34:03.809
>> WE'RE TWO EVICTIONS AWAY FROM
TOP FIVE.

34:03.842 --> 34:13.885
WE GET TO THE TOP FIVE
--

34:13.885 --> 34:23.895
WE GET TO THE TOP FIVE
--

34:49.688 --> 34:53.091
>> OTHER THAN CHRISTMAS, PAUL IS
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON THAT I

34:53.125 --> 34:54.360
TRUST IN THIS HOUSE.

34:54.393 --> 34:58.997
BUT I QUESTION THE PEOPLE THAT
HE HAS SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.699
>> HE'S A SMART GUY.

35:00.732 --> 35:05.637
HE KNOW WHAT'S HE'S DOING.
>> THE LAST THING I NEED IS SOME

35:05.671 --> 35:06.872
SHADINESS TO MESS THIS UP.

35:06.905 --> 35:11.277
I HOPE HE KNOWS THAT CHRISTMAS
AND I HAVE HIS BACK 100% AND

35:11.310 --> 35:15.281
HOPEFULLY HE HAS OUR BACK AS

35:16.148 --> 35:17.383
>> IT'S GOING TO GET REAL REAL
QUICK.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.252
*
>> GOOD NIGHT.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.220
>> GOOD NIGHT.

35:54.253 --> 35:57.656
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

35:57.689 --> 36:00.692
>> CAN'T WAIT TO JOSH GETS IN
BED.

36:05.231 --> 36:10.202
>> TELL JOSH TO GET IN BED.
>> JOSH, GO TO BED.

36:10.236 --> 36:20.279
*
>> WHERE IS HE?

36:20.279 --> 36:31.390
*
>> WHERE IS HE?

36:31.423 --> 36:34.125
*
>> I WAS MAD AT YOU FOR FALLING

36:34.159 --> 36:34.893
OFF A LITTLE BIT.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.995
>> I HEARD YOU.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.829
I KNOW.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.966
I HAD LIKE SIX SURGERIES ON MY
WRIST.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.268
MY WRIST FREEZES.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.136
I DON'T WANT TO TELL ANYBODY TO
MAKE EXCUSES.

36:45.170 --> 36:46.238
I AIN'T NO CHUMP.

36:46.272 --> 36:51.477
BUT EVENTUALLY, HAVE TO HIT
SOMETHING.

36:51.510 --> 36:54.746
HOPEFULLY I'M HERE FOR FOUR MORE
AND I GET A CHANCE.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.683
SO ALEX IS HAPPY.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.751
PAUL IS HAPPY.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.019
YOU'RE HAPPY.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.722
I'M HAPPY.

37:03.755 --> 37:04.956
WHAT ABOUT CHRISTMAS AND JOSH?

37:04.990 --> 37:10.829
ARE THEY SAYING ANYTHING TO YOU?

37:10.862 --> 37:18.069
>> IF I WERE YOU, I'D KEEP YOUR
EARS OPEN AND MOUTH SHUT ABOUT

37:18.103 --> 37:19.571
THAT.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.973
>> I JUST WANT TO BE ON THE SAME
PAGE.

37:22.007 --> 37:25.677
I WILL TELL YOU, I WENT IN, FELT
BAD AND VOTED BUT I DIDN'T.

37:25.711 --> 37:30.616
>> YOU HAVE TO QUIT ACTING LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

37:30.649 --> 37:35.387
THAT MAKE PEOPLE QUESTION YOU.
>> SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE THINK SOME

37:35.421 --> 37:38.690
OF US DID IT.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.626
MARK DIDN'T SAY GOOD-BYE TO ME.

37:40.659 --> 37:43.228
>> I GAVE HIM -- I DON'T KNOW.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.463
>> WASN'T THAT PECULIAR?

37:44.496 --> 37:45.263
>> IT WAS.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.198
>> SO WHAT IS MY BEST PLAY RIGHT
NOW?

37:47.232 --> 37:51.002
>> KEVIN, I'M TELLING YOU WITH
100% CERTAINTY.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.305
TRUST WHAT I'M SAYING.

37:53.339 --> 37:54.540
RELAX.

37:54.573 --> 37:57.443
IF YOU KEEP ACTING CRAZY AND
QUESTIONING EVERYTHING AND EVERY

37:57.476 --> 38:00.346
ONE, TO MORE YOUR GETTING TO GET
IN TROUBLE.

38:00.379 --> 38:01.947
STOP DIGGING.

38:01.980 --> 38:06.718
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY UNTIL
YOU HAVE TO WORRY.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.754
>> I GOT YOU.

38:09.187 --> 38:20.298
>> KEVIN JUST KEEPS ON
ALL THE TIME EVERYWHERE I GO.

38:20.332 --> 38:23.301
>> PAUL HAD ALREADY LET ME KNOW
THAT THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT I

38:23.335 --> 38:25.737
COULD BE GOING UP AS A PAWN.

38:25.771 --> 38:29.107
AND I WANT TO TALK TO JASON TO
FEEL HIM OUT.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.141
WHERE IS HIS HEAD.

38:30.175 --> 38:33.211
LIKE WHO ARE YOU GOING TO
NOMINATE?

38:33.244 --> 38:34.179
>> I'M WITH KEVIN.

38:34.212 --> 38:36.348
WIN THE HOH, I'M WINNING.

38:36.382 --> 38:38.316
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.318
>> DID HE FALL OFF OR JUMP OFF?

38:40.352 --> 38:41.019
>> I DON'T KNOW.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.654
HE FELL OFF BECAUSE I TOLD HIM.

38:42.688 --> 38:45.824
I TOLD HIM IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO
START WINNING SOMETHING.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.860
YOU DON'T GET A RIDE WITH
WINNERS IF YOU AIN'T WINNING.

38:48.894 --> 38:53.599
HE SAID I HAD A LOT OF SURGERIES
IN MY WRIST.

38:53.632 --> 38:54.800
>> PACEMAKER?

38:54.833 --> 38:58.770
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I SLAMMED
HIM ON THE BLOCK RIGHT NOW?

38:58.804 --> 39:01.873
>> WE WOULD GO INSANE.

39:01.907 --> 39:07.779
>> SIT BACK AND WATCH AND LIKE
YOU LITERALLY HAVE DONE NOTHING

39:07.813 --> 39:10.682
FOR ANYBODY.
>> HE'S LIKE I KNOW I MIGHT NOT

39:10.716 --> 39:14.986
BE VERY GOOD IN THE COMPS, BUT
MY SOCIAL GAME IS BETTER THAN

39:15.020 --> 39:16.522
EVERYONE ELSE'S IN HERE.

39:16.555 --> 39:20.959
I'M LIKE --
>> WHAT?

39:20.992 --> 39:29.435
>> I AM SO HAPPY THAT JASON TALK
TO KEVIN AND THE WAY HE'S

39:29.468 --> 39:30.436
ACTING.

39:30.469 --> 39:36.708
IT'S CLEAR THAT KEVIN IS THE
TARGET THIS YEAR.

39:36.742 --> 39:37.809
>> THANKS.

39:37.843 --> 39:40.311
>> I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL MATTHEW
ABOUT IT AND MAKE HIM

39:40.345 --> 39:43.415
COMFORTABLE ABOUT THE SITUATION,
THIS IS GREAT.

39:43.449 --> 39:51.056
>> JUST TO CLARIFY, ARE WE
SHOOTING AT MATT FIRST?

39:51.089 --> 39:53.659
>> I DON'T CARE.

39:53.692 --> 39:59.030
>> IF YOU SPLIT THEM, SHE WILL
CRUMBLE.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.066
>> I THINK SO, TOO.

40:28.026 --> 40:33.565
>> I'M REALLY HOPING THAT KEVIN
IS TRULY JASON'S TARGET.

40:33.599 --> 40:38.303
OTHERWISE, EITHER MYSELF OR
RAVEN IS GOING TO GO HOME.

40:38.336 --> 40:40.338
IT'S SOMETHING I'M NOT READY TO
HANDLE RIGHT NOW.

40:56.254 --> 41:00.358
>> I'M ABOUT TO USE ANY BOOT TO
DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND AND SHOW

41:00.391 --> 41:04.596
THE PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE THAT
THEY'RE NOT AS COMFORTABLE AS

41:04.630 --> 41:05.797
THEY THINK THEY ARE.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.165
>> HEY, EVERYONE.

41:07.198 --> 41:17.242
TOM FOR THE NOMINATION CEREMONY.

41:17.242 --> 41:23.949
TOM FOR THE NOMINATION CEREMONY.

41:23.982 --> 41:27.085
>> THIS IS THE NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

41:27.118 --> 41:31.222
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE

41:31.256 --> 41:32.958
TWO HOUSE GUESTS FOR EVICTION.

41:32.991 --> 41:37.462
IN MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS TO THE HOUSE GUESTS I'M

41:37.495 --> 41:38.730
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

41:38.764 --> 41:42.801
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATIONS AND THEIR FACES

41:42.834 --> 41:46.437
WILL APPEAR ON THE MEMORY WALL.

41:46.471 --> 41:58.183
THE FIRST HOUSE GUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS -- THE NEXT HOUSE

41:58.216 --> 42:08.326
GUEST I HAVE NOMINATED IS --
I'VE NOMINATED YOU RAVEN AND

42:08.326 --> 42:17.035
GUEST I HAVE NOMINATED IS --
I'VE NOMINATED YOU RAVEN AND

42:17.068 --> 42:17.736
YOU, MATT.

42:17.769 --> 42:19.971
IT'S OLD HAT IMPORTANT YOU GUYS.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.940
YOU'LL PROBABLY FEEL COMFORTABLE
UP THERE.

42:21.973 --> 42:23.308
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE
AGENDA IS.

42:23.341 --> 42:28.346
WE HAVE A BIG POV COMING UP
TOMORROW.

42:28.379 --> 42:29.815
LET'S WIN THE POV.

42:29.848 --> 42:36.788
WITH THAT SAID, THIS NOMINATION
CEREMONY IS ADJOURNED.

42:36.822 --> 42:40.626
>> JASON'S SPEECH, HE BASICALLY
SAID THE HOUSE HAS AN AGENDA,

42:40.659 --> 42:42.728
WHICH IS TO BACK-DOOR KEVIN.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.896
WE WANT TO BLINDSIDE HIM.

42:44.930 --> 42:50.602
HOPEFULLY JASON STAYS TRUE TO
HIS WORD AND KEVIN GOES UP THERE

42:50.636 --> 42:52.704
AND WE BOOK-DOOR HIM.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.640
SORRY, BUD, BUT YOU HAVE TO GO.

42:54.673 --> 42:57.442
>> I'M ON THE BLOCK FOR THE
FOURTH TIME IN A ROW.

42:57.475 --> 43:02.580
FOR ME TO SURVIVE THE WEEK,
KEVIN JUST NEEDS TO NOT WIN THE

43:02.614 --> 43:03.581
VETO.

43:03.615 --> 43:05.917
IF RAVEN END UP ON THE BLOCK,
I'M GOING TO JURY.

43:05.951 --> 43:07.719
I'M NOT STOPPING AT THIS POINT.

43:07.753 --> 43:09.154
I HAVE TO GET THE JOB DONE.

43:09.187 --> 43:12.824
>> SO MATT AND RAVEN SIT ON THE
BLOCK AND THIS IS GREAT.

43:12.858 --> 43:19.030
THESE PEOPLE ARE RIPPING EACH
OTHER'S HEAD OFF AND ME AND MY

43:19.064 --> 43:21.032
GIRL CHRISTMAS ARE JUST ENJOYING
THE VIEW.

43:21.066 --> 43:25.536
>> WHO WILL WIN THE POWER OF
VETO AND WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE

43:25.570 --> 43:29.140
MATT OR RAVEN FROM EVICTION?

43:29.174 --> 43:34.345
FIND OUT WEDNESDAY AT 8/7
CENTRAL OR "BIG BROTHER."
