WEBVTT

00:01.767 --> 00:02.301
Hey! Hey, guys.

00:02.436 --> 00:03.836
Oh, hey, paul.

00:03.971 --> 00:05.804
Just marking down all our
birthdays in the calendar

00:05.806 --> 00:07.539
And it turns out
I don't have yours.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.407
Oh, yeah.
That makes sense.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.409
Paul.
Yeah.

00:11.411 --> 00:12.778
When's your b-dizzle?

00:12.913 --> 00:14.479
Uh, it's kinda
complicated.

00:14.481 --> 00:16.048
Oh, come on.
Age is just a number.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.383
Well, September 12th
is my jail birthday.

00:18.385 --> 00:19.885
I got assigned that b-day

00:19.954 --> 00:21.853
When my cellmate found out
we were born on the same day.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.989
Hamburger mouth
was very proprietary.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.058
Aw, hamburger mouth!
That's a fun nickname.

00:26.193 --> 00:29.060
He was not fun. You don't even
wanna know what he was in for.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.195
Well, it can't
have been worse

00:30.330 --> 00:31.663
Than robbing you
of your special day.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.866
He was a cannibal.
I stand corrected.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.868
Anyway, so, I don't really
celebrate because of that.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.103
Well, forget that
big ole b-day bully.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.471
It's time for you
to reclaim your day

00:39.606 --> 00:40.805
And you can bet
we're gonna fête

00:40.841 --> 00:42.341
With cake
and ice cream.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.609
Yeah, I mean, hamburger's
still in for another 25 years

00:44.645 --> 00:46.278
So, what the heck?

00:47.948 --> 00:50.682
Uh, my real birthday's
April 14th.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.385
Aren't you gonna write
it in?

00:53.520 --> 00:55.921
Yes, I sure am.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.422
(nervous chuckling)

00:57.425 --> 00:59.858
Looks like we have more
in common than we thought.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.559
Sorry I went a little crazy
with bubble letters.

01:01.595 --> 01:05.097
So silly to think no one else
would have the same b-day.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.098
Many people do

01:06.233 --> 01:07.966
Including you and
a cannibal apparently,

01:08.102 --> 01:09.901
So, we'll just split
the cake and ice cream.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.570
Did I say the 14th?
I meant the fourth.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.505
You don't have to lie.

01:13.541 --> 01:14.840
No, I just forget.

01:14.975 --> 01:17.576
Hamburger and me are the fourth.
April fourth.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.577
Oh, thank god.
(giggling)

01:19.613 --> 01:21.379
Yay, April babies!

01:21.415 --> 01:22.781
(chuckling)

01:22.916 --> 01:24.850
April fourth-
shelter birthday.

01:24.919 --> 01:27.586
Better make a note
of that somewhere.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.888
♪ I don't lose my cool ♪

01:29.890 --> 01:31.390

Ooh! I read that one.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.239
Great read.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.474
Is it?

01:49.510 --> 01:51.143
A friend of mine had something
published in it.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.410
I find it all
kind of boring,

01:52.446 --> 01:54.446
But hashtag women
supporting women, right?

01:54.581 --> 01:55.513
Totally.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.781
Women are so boring,

01:56.851 --> 01:58.150
But I support all
my friends too.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.285
That's not--
but good for you.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.886
So...

02:01.922 --> 02:03.622
Do you think ravi's the one?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.224
(shattering)

02:05.359 --> 02:06.959
Sorry.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.960
Um,
that's a big question.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.630
'cause I think
I met my soulmate

02:11.632 --> 02:14.833
And you and ravi
seem so together.

02:14.835 --> 02:15.701
Do they?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.035
I mean, they do,

02:17.171 --> 02:20.205
But also very independent
from each other.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.107
So what makes you think this
person's your soulmate?

02:22.242 --> 02:25.710
Well, the other day
we were having coffee

02:25.779 --> 02:26.978
And he called me
"darling".

02:27.114 --> 02:30.649
Aww. You went
on a coffee date?

02:30.718 --> 02:31.650
Sort of.

02:31.785 --> 02:32.851
We didn't talk much.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.385
But when I was leaving,

02:34.421 --> 02:36.388
He asked if I wanted
to take the rest to go

02:36.457 --> 02:38.323
And I said yes.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.460
Then he said "okay" and
poured it into a takeout cup

02:41.595 --> 02:44.263
And topped it up, no charge.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.132
Sorry, joy, was this person
working at the coffee shop?

02:47.134 --> 02:48.467
Mm-hm.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.735
Well, it sounds like you two
definitely shared a connection

02:50.804 --> 02:52.271
But I wouldn't
limit yourself.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.839
I agree.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.806
Not that
you're asking,

02:54.875 --> 02:55.940
But that is
great advice.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.475
Don't settle!

02:57.477 --> 03:00.144
You don't think coffee hottie
could be the one?

03:00.181 --> 03:01.947
It's just you might wanna
find out people's names

03:02.082 --> 03:03.515
If they're gonna be
your soulmate.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.816
Lara.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.952
I mean, yes, lara,
you would.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.320
Are you online?

03:08.455 --> 03:11.289
There are a lot of apps
for meeting people,

03:11.358 --> 03:13.091
And there are ones where
women make all the moves

03:13.160 --> 03:14.626
So you're in control.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.228
What sites are you on?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.630
Oh. Uh, date--

03:18.765 --> 03:20.765
Dater. Date.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.634
Lara:
Yeah, tons of great ones.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.936
Still,
the longer you wait,

03:24.071 --> 03:25.704
The longer it'll take
to meet your soulmate.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.905
Like ravi?

03:26.974 --> 03:28.573
No, more like darren.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.842
But he moved to costa rica
and married a dolphin trainer.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.311
Still, would it kill him
to like my posts

03:32.313 --> 03:34.045
Or congratulate me on
my climbing certificate?

03:34.181 --> 03:36.014
I did it for you!
(chuckling)

03:36.149 --> 03:38.951
Anyway,
it's fun meeting people.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.188
That coffee guy once
called me darling too.

03:55.335 --> 03:57.402
Oh, um, just
lookin' for nikki.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.204
She works for me
over at mckibbin's.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.206
She has a job?
Like, another job?

04:01.341 --> 04:02.741
She buses part-time
at our bar.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.009
Wow, fun!
Love that pub grub.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.145
Best wings in the city
three years runnin'!

04:07.214 --> 04:08.346
Go you!

04:08.415 --> 04:09.614
(awkward chuckling)
thanks.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.082
Uh, so,
is she around?

04:11.151 --> 04:12.551
She's not
answering the phone.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.020
Right. Uh, she got into
a fight with her boyfriend

04:15.155 --> 04:16.488
And threw his phone
out the car window

04:16.623 --> 04:19.691
Only turns out it wasn't
his phone, it was hers.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.892
Relationships, right?

04:20.894 --> 04:22.827
I don't know.
I'm single.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.629
Samesies!

04:24.632 --> 04:25.964
Okay. Well, um,

04:26.099 --> 04:28.767
Just tell nikki
I'm short-staffed Saturday

04:28.902 --> 04:30.902
And I need someone
to host trivia.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.070
She's always
volunteering,

04:32.106 --> 04:33.772
Mostly to get
out of cleaning,

04:33.841 --> 04:36.575
But if she wants a shot,
then this is it.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.576
I'll be there!

04:37.711 --> 04:38.977
I mean,
she'll be there, nikki.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.713
And uh, me too probably,
because we tight.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.781
(awkward chuckling)

04:42.850 --> 04:45.050
Um, yep.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.852
I am texting her
right now,

04:46.854 --> 04:49.120
And... She's in.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.556
I thought her phone
was trashed.

04:51.558 --> 04:52.858
Good memory.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.726
You are gonna
kill it at trivia.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.428
Okay,
I'll see you Saturday.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.068
God, I thought
he'd never leave!

05:03.203 --> 05:04.536
Wait, we you hiding?

05:04.671 --> 05:06.338
Duh, there's no way
I'm working Saturday.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.939
He said you'd
always wanted to.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.674
I nodded one time

05:09.743 --> 05:11.476
'cause I was hiding
fries in my mouth.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.146
Nikki, this is an amazing
opportunity for you.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.747
Meet new people
in a super caj' way,

05:15.783 --> 05:20.084
Expose yourself to a whole
new career possibility.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.819
I'll even come
cheer you on.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.388
And I'll buy
the first round.

05:23.390 --> 05:26.224
I mean, I do like
telling people they're wrong.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.959
Great!
Then it's a date!

05:28.028 --> 05:29.294
Oh, and I need you to clean
meow town.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.963
It is fur balls
for miles.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.832
I would, but I have to
prep for trivia.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.568
Gee, shan, was that you I

05:55.722 --> 05:56.855
Really?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.123
Maybe I should add that
to my bio.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.123
Definitely.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.325
(beeping)
cute. Cute.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.528
Whoa. This guy's tagline is

06:03.663 --> 06:05.597
"I'll know I've found the one
when I meet you."

06:05.599 --> 06:06.598
(squealing)

06:06.600 --> 06:08.934
How am I ever
gonna pick the one?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.268
Well, maybe go on
a date or two

06:10.337 --> 06:11.803
Before you plan
the wedding?

06:11.938 --> 06:13.605
Uh, more like ten dates.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.274
(beeping)
11. 12.

06:16.276 --> 06:19.211
Oh my gosh, does this make me
a s-l- you know what?

06:19.346 --> 06:21.112
You realize they have to
match with you, right?

06:21.247 --> 06:23.748
Uh, with this app
I get to decide.

06:23.751 --> 06:24.883
But they have to
like you back.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.217
So, you think
they're hotties

06:26.286 --> 06:27.953
But they have to think
you're a hottie.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.621
Not that you're
not a hottie.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.956
Objectively, you're
not unattractive.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.625
I'm just not
attracted to you.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.794
Because I'm so busy
with my own online hotties,

06:36.796 --> 06:38.363
Like this one.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.363

06:39.400 --> 06:41.099
Anyway, just don't, uh,

Count your guys

06:42.902 --> 06:44.202
So to speak.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.238
I get it.
You're just jealous.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.372
No. How?

06:47.374 --> 06:48.840
Why would I--

To drop this off!

07:05.893 --> 07:07.525
A hot, steamy
new issue of--

07:07.561 --> 07:09.995
<i> Okay crochet!</i>
Is this for nikki?

07:10.130 --> 07:11.229
No, for you, sweetie.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.497
You complimented
my beret last week

07:12.633 --> 07:13.932
So I thought you might
wanna learn!

07:13.934 --> 07:15.233
Right, of course!

07:15.269 --> 07:17.235
Unless your compliment
was a fib.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.004
What? No!
Love dat hat.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.905
And crochet's
for everyone,

07:20.941 --> 07:22.407
Even someone with
masculine hands.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.809
Well, thank you.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.845
Well, there's something
I don't hear too often.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.079
What do you mean?
Nothing.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.482
I just-- I have
a very satisfactory life

07:30.617 --> 07:33.218
But sometimes it just
feels good to be appreciated.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.020
Oh, I'm sorry
if I haven't been--

07:35.155 --> 07:36.121
I meant my husband.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.222
Who's more interested
in an old car than the woman

07:38.258 --> 07:40.358
Who's been putting food in front
of him for 34 years.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.627
Well, he does make
those great fajitas.

07:42.762 --> 07:43.961
No, but I getcha.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.429
And then there's nikki.

07:45.466 --> 07:48.199
I have no idea
what she's up to.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.501
The laundry pile in her doorway
is my only proof

07:50.537 --> 07:52.370
She's not face-down
in a ditch somewhere.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.838
She has a lot going on
right now, between

07:53.907 --> 07:56.908
Working here and now hosting
bar trivia at mckibbin's.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.843
I didn't even
know that!

07:58.879 --> 08:00.245
I used to work
in a diner

08:00.314 --> 08:01.513
During the summers
in port dalhousie.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.314
Sweet potato.
Do you know it?

08:03.350 --> 08:05.050
Nope, but you've
talked about it.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.785
It's so weird nikki
wouldn't tell me.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.453
She's probably
been too busy,

08:08.455 --> 08:10.988
But I know that I-- she is
really excited about it.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.124
Well, my weekend's
pretty exciting too.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.526
Saturday's
meal prep day,

08:14.661 --> 08:17.529
Followed by
sit alone Sunday.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.365
Meal prep? That's fun.
(chuckling)

08:20.434 --> 08:22.933
So, what's this
mcribbon's place like?

08:22.935 --> 08:24.035
It's nothing fancy,

08:24.170 --> 08:26.071
Just a neighbourhood bar
for regular joes.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.438
Sounds cozy.
The kind of place

08:27.474 --> 08:29.140
Where they welcome you
with a warm smile,

08:29.276 --> 08:30.675
Maybe a bit of scruff
on the face

08:30.810 --> 08:33.411
And a scent that's like
a strong cup of coffee,

08:33.413 --> 08:36.248
Afternoon rain,
and a cowboy.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.551
I'm in!

08:39.686 --> 08:42.387
Oh, well, well,
what about meal prep?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.489
Defrost your own
turkey à la king, russ.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.424
Saturday night
is ladies' night!

08:46.559 --> 08:47.993
Oh,
it's in the afternoon.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.493
Then let the
day drinking begin.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.029
Oh, and the pattern
I used

08:51.098 --> 08:52.831
Is french bistro babe
beret.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.200
It goes with everything.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.437
(quietly)
great.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.576
(giggling)

09:04.578 --> 09:06.311
Kristian:
Something sounds funny.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.779
Just talking to tobias.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.714
Oh!
Who's tobias?

09:09.849 --> 09:12.183
Uh, one of my many matches
on snuggler.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.319
Looks like someone
is a hottie.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.254
Well, I'm glad to hear
it's going so well.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.190
And I'm not at all
surprised.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.593
I'm slaying it too.
Bee tee dubs.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.327
Yeah. You know,
a few too many women

09:23.363 --> 09:25.196
Were impressed with my
orienteering trophies.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.531
I just needed a breather,
you know?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.600
Just put the focus back
on the animals.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.168
Wow! Look at
those cheekbones.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.971
Yeah. Kind of a cross
between harry styles

09:32.973 --> 09:35.206
And gaston from
<i> beauty and the beast.</i>

09:35.242 --> 09:38.409
And he uses full sentences
like a british prince.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.144
Oh, joy.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.212
I don't wanna
kill the vibe here,

09:41.348 --> 09:44.015
But as far as
mr. Ice tray abs,

09:44.017 --> 09:46.017
All signs point
to a catfish.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.552
A what?

09:47.621 --> 09:49.420
Catfishers
troll the internet

09:49.456 --> 09:51.222
Lying about who they are
to trick people.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.690
They're the worst.
Look it up.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.627
But he's a lawyer,
and plays the cello

09:55.629 --> 09:57.495
And volunteers
at a community food centre.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.229
No.

09:58.364 --> 09:59.664
Best case scenario,

09:59.700 --> 10:01.499
This guy lives with
his mom and some ferrets.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.768
Worst case he lives
without his mom,

10:03.770 --> 10:05.236
Because he murdered her.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.239
Okay, I can tell
if someone's real.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.507
Just because
you can't get a date

10:09.509 --> 10:10.575
Doesn't mean
everyone's a jerk.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.711
No, that's not--
I have-- no.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.245
And at least I'm not
hiding in the back

10:14.314 --> 10:15.446
With a bunch
of homeless animals

10:15.515 --> 10:17.849
Who only like me
because I feed them.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.183
I'm talking about you!

10:19.185 --> 10:20.785
Yeah.

10:20.787 --> 10:24.222
Well, workplace bullying
is not the answer.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.123
♪

10:26.159 --> 10:29.460
♪ did you notice... ♪

10:29.595 --> 10:31.396
Okay, people,

10:31.465 --> 10:33.731
So, liquor up
and tip your bartenders.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.234
We pool tips, and I'm about
to serve up gold.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.403
Hey!

10:38.538 --> 10:40.471
Nikki, you look
so great up there!

10:40.507 --> 10:41.939
I know. Sick hair day.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.475
And you should've heard
my sound check.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.209
My joke about french
toilet paper killed.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.844
Your mom is gonna be
so proud.

10:46.913 --> 10:47.912
What?

10:47.914 --> 10:49.480
Oh, yeah. She kinda
invited herself.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.415
She's just exchanging numbers
with the uber driver.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.418
How did she even
find out?

10:53.553 --> 10:56.421
I may have told her,
but it's gonna be fine.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.289
(nervous chuckling)
would you say hat on or off?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.691
What do
most people do?

10:59.826 --> 11:02.226
Does fergus have rules
about that or--?

11:02.295 --> 11:04.162
Are you calling him?
Don't tell him I asked.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.798
Hey mom, that thing shannon
told you about is cancelled.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.800
Nikki, no,
she's excited to come!

11:09.836 --> 11:11.969
Peg gets high on critiquing.
It's her drug of choice

11:12.005 --> 11:13.772
And that's why I never
invite her to anything.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.340
Well, if she's starts
getting chippy,

11:15.475 --> 11:17.308
I'll just throw down
some classic retort burns.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.711
I was on the improv team
in high school?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.312
Is that a brag?

11:21.381 --> 11:23.314
There she is,
my angel muffin!

11:23.450 --> 11:25.583
Oh, and look at
all that eyeliner.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.584
Spooky!

11:26.720 --> 11:28.385
'cause spooky's
where it's at.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.921
Good for you,
niknak.

11:30.056 --> 11:31.055
Don't call me that.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.456
I'm just so jazzed!

11:32.492 --> 11:33.858
You've always wanted
to do stuff like this

11:33.993 --> 11:36.027
And now you're doin' it,
in a bar!

11:36.162 --> 11:37.528
Next stop, broadway!

11:37.530 --> 11:38.697
Bit of a stretch.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.664
Well, we gotta dream
big, right niknak?

11:40.701 --> 11:42.867
Only I call her that.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.070
Wow, so glad
you both came.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.357
Uh, I'm reading the animals
their horoscopes.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.759
Uh, it's an emergency.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.694
Yes, chester's moon

12:09.829 --> 12:11.529
I don't want
him to see me!

12:13.767 --> 12:16.701
Oh my god.
Is that tobias?

12:16.836 --> 12:19.837
He's like a photoshopped version
of his own photo.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.139
But he's not
supposed to be here.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.240
What?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.576
After all that stuff you said
about catfishing,

12:25.612 --> 12:26.845
I stopped messaging him.

12:26.847 --> 12:27.645
Good.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.247
I mean,
he is gorgeous,

12:29.382 --> 12:31.182
But everything beyond that
is pure weirdo.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.451
I could drown
in those brown eyes.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.553
And he would help you
with that.

Good job, honey.
You too, nikki!

12:51.905 --> 12:53.171
That's my daughter
up there.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.539
But stand up straight,

So brave to bear our arms
in this weather, brrr!

13:06.086 --> 13:07.151
In what 19--

13:07.154 --> 13:08.519
New sparkle top,
who dis?

13:08.654 --> 13:09.887
Is that right?
Did I get that right?

13:09.923 --> 13:11.589
And what do you think
of my top?

13:11.591 --> 13:14.158
Kinda crazy, right? I got it
in the discount bin.

13:14.194 --> 13:17.762
Oh, well, I'm sure it was
very pretty before it shrunk.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.298
When I was your age
we had so many rules

13:20.367 --> 13:23.334
And morals and modesty.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.303
That is-- so true.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.504
Refill?

13:26.506 --> 13:27.638
Oh, yes, please.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.241
But don't put
your fingers in it.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.709
Okay.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.444
Who's a good girl?
Hi. Yes.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.746
Can I help you?

13:35.782 --> 13:37.315
Oh.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.983
Hey, there.
Tobias anders.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.651
Sounds even faker
when you say it out loud.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.687
Uh, sorry. I just came by
to check on a woman

13:42.689 --> 13:43.855
Who works here. Joy.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.456
Yeah, I know
what her name is.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.523
Oh, she's doing okay?

13:46.560 --> 13:47.658
She's alive and well,

13:47.727 --> 13:48.993
So, let's keep it
that way.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.695
Oh, when she
stopped responding

13:50.830 --> 13:52.664
I started wondering, what if
something's wrong, you know?

13:52.799 --> 13:54.666
Yeah, well, all is good.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.401
So, let's move along.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.403
Yeah, yeah.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.805
A catch like joy
has her pick of the litter,

14:00.940 --> 14:02.273
And I barely passed
harvard law.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.409
Mostly because I was touring
with my string quartet,

14:05.478 --> 14:07.345
But whatever.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.480
Take a hint, tobias.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.815
Anyways,
have a good day.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.350
Hey.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.152
How did you know
where joy works?

14:14.154 --> 14:16.421
Oh, she had posted some
pictures of herself at work,

14:16.556 --> 14:17.488
Kinda like...

14:17.624 --> 14:19.757
That does kinda
look like her.

14:19.759 --> 14:22.493
She had that sign
in the background.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.495
Thought we had
a connection, but--

14:24.497 --> 14:25.997
I guess not.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.571
Okay, okay.
Until 2005--

14:33.573 --> 14:36.107
Lemme guess,
white wine, vodka tonic.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.643
Uh, nope. I'm more of
an old-fashioned gal.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.311
Drinks-wise,
not other things-wise.

14:41.313 --> 14:42.947
Good to know.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.583
Columella,
yes, it's a tie.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.453
Ooh, I love
maraschino cherries.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.154
Would you mind giving me
a couple extra?

14:52.325 --> 14:53.457
More.

14:53.459 --> 14:54.726
You may have a problem--

14:54.861 --> 14:57.161
A barstool! I haven't sat
on one of these

14:57.197 --> 14:59.464
Since they outlawed
cigarettes!

14:59.466 --> 15:00.864
Nikki:
Oh, here's an easy one.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.134
What is added to gin
to make pink gin?

15:03.203 --> 15:04.202
Gatorade?

15:04.204 --> 15:05.436
Lemonade?
Grenadine!

15:05.505 --> 15:06.504
Ooh! Bitters!

15:06.639 --> 15:08.373
Shans for the win!

15:08.375 --> 15:10.108
Oh yeah, up top!

15:11.711 --> 15:13.244
Maybe the rest of us
would have a shot

15:13.246 --> 15:16.915
If all the questions weren't
about booze and partying.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.216
Write what you know!

15:18.218 --> 15:19.817
Not that booze and partying
is all she knows.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.819
Peggy:
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.

15:21.821 --> 15:24.488
We love you no matter how many
times you puke on the doorstep.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.024
Okay, that's it.
I'm taking five.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.258
Game's not over yet.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.560
She gets her mood swings
from her father's side.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.229
I'll talk to her.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.298
Nikki!

15:34.367 --> 15:35.499
You need
to take her home.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.701
I haven't even
finished my drink.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.036
She's ruining everything.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.237
Nikki, come on. You made
a commitment to fergus.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.206
Nikki:
I didn't even wanna do this
but you bullied me into it

15:42.242 --> 15:44.041
And now peggy's
bullying me out of it.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.676
Okay, look. I know
the situation isn't ideal,

15:45.712 --> 15:47.812
But you're 30...
Something years old,

15:47.881 --> 15:49.580
And you need to tell
your mom how you feel.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.115
A little bit of honesty
might go farther

15:51.151 --> 15:52.249
Than the eye rolls.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.651
Okay, fine.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.086
And excuse my french
but you need to grow a pair.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.822
I said fine.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.624
Peg, we need to talk.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.326
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You were right.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.462
The super-stalkers
are everywhere.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.397
No, no.
I was projecting.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.664
You got a date
with a hottie

16:07.701 --> 16:09.400
And I got
radio silenced.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.202
I made a huge mistake.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.805
Or, is there an opportunity here
that we can salvage?

16:13.940 --> 16:16.474
Oh, I'd prefer
we stay co-workers.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.275
No-- no.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.744
Tobias?

16:21.147 --> 16:22.747
Tobias:
Hi.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.215
I'm here to see joy.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.282
Yeah, this is joy.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.884
Oh my god.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.187
Joy's a veterinarian.
Who's this?

16:30.690 --> 16:32.923
I'm a catfish.

16:32.959 --> 16:33.925
What?

16:33.927 --> 16:35.360
Uh, you just got me
so worried

16:35.495 --> 16:37.928
About my match potential, I used
pictures that weren't me.

16:37.964 --> 16:38.862
Oh, joy.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.698
But you said you saw
the sign?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.966
Wait- whose pics
did you use?

16:43.003 --> 16:44.235
Lara's.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.437
She's the coolest,
prettiest person I know,

16:46.473 --> 16:48.572
Other than my sister,
but she's a nightmare, so--

16:48.608 --> 16:49.940
I thought your sister
was younger.

16:49.976 --> 16:50.874
She is.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.543
Sorry- who's lara?

16:52.545 --> 16:55.412
The veterinarian that we're--
that you're pining after.

16:55.414 --> 16:56.547
"pining" is strong.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.315
Mmm, you showed up
at her work.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.984
I'm so sorry.

16:59.986 --> 17:03.387
You're clearly a nice guy
with super cute dimples,

17:03.456 --> 17:05.123
But I wasted your time.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.757
Just when I thought
online dating

17:06.793 --> 17:08.926
Couldn't get any worse,
it sinks a notch lower.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.061
Hey.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.795
You may have a face
that women dream of

17:11.831 --> 17:13.531
And joy may not be
the sophisticated,

17:13.600 --> 17:15.666
Gazelle-like queen
that lara is,

17:15.735 --> 17:19.603
But joy is a warm,
bright, hardworking person

17:19.639 --> 17:21.939
That anyone would be
thrilled to date.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.074
I deal with enough liars
in court.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.109
Ugh, we get it.
You're a lawyer!

17:25.111 --> 17:27.879
And my moms are on a rowing team
with marnie mcbean.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.747
So-- we all have things
we could brag about.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.017
I was also pre-med.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.285
Oh, is the
real lara around?

17:34.354 --> 17:35.553
No.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.255
Okay.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.494
I'm so sorry for getting you
wrapped up in all this.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.629
It's fine.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.963
It's not.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.831
I lied to you,
and to him.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.367
Everybody lies.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.369
Heck, I lied and it didn't
even get me a match.

17:52.371 --> 17:53.237
(chuckling)

17:53.372 --> 17:55.640
I never won
the orienteering cup.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.108
I came second.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.976
And there were only
two of us.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.511
And the winner beat me
by an hour.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.645
At least we came clean.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.247
Okay, an hour
and 23 minutes.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.249
Wow.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.518
And one of my eyebrows
was completely burnt off

18:07.554 --> 18:08.986
But it didn't matter

18:09.022 --> 18:10.721
'cause I just swiped
the hair to one side.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.256
(chuckling)

18:12.258 --> 18:13.457
Sorry, am I rambling?

18:13.526 --> 18:14.659
Yeah.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.059
I mean, uh, no.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.662
It sounds great, I just--
we need to get started.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.331
I could cover for her.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.332
Really?

18:21.334 --> 18:23.066
Yeah. I'm no nikki bernard,

18:23.103 --> 18:24.669
But I did sing
the national anthem

18:24.804 --> 18:26.670
At a st. John's
ice caps game once.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.072
I have the recording.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.274
Oh, lainey's gonna start
belting out mellencamp.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.542
Can you get up there?

18:31.544 --> 18:33.844
Yes.

18:33.847 --> 18:36.480
Hello, mckibbin's!

18:36.483 --> 18:37.748
How's everyone doin'?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.550
(nervous chuckling)
um--

18:39.586 --> 18:44.087
Shannon here to keep
this trivia train a-movin'.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.590
All aboard!
(clearing throat)

18:45.592 --> 18:48.592
Oh, and a round of applause
for ya boy, fergus,

18:48.628 --> 18:51.229
A vision in flannel.
(giggling)

18:51.364 --> 18:55.366
Uh, open up dem ears, 'cause
here's the next q for you.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.967
Aww. Complete this
<i> love actually</i> quote.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.636
"to me, you are--"

18:58.705 --> 18:59.837
Nikki:
Unbelievable.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.972
The correct answer
is "perfect",

19:01.107 --> 19:03.173
But half points
for ballpark.

19:03.209 --> 19:04.575
Oh my god, nikki!
Get up here.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.010
I can't believe you.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.445
First you invite
my mortal enemy--

19:07.580 --> 19:09.480
Her mom.
She means her mom.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.781
Who I sent home,
by the way,

19:10.850 --> 19:12.182
And now you're stealing
my questions.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.584
You got them
off the internet.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.519
No, I researched them.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.920
But of course you didn't notice.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.588
You've been too busy
flirting with fergie.

19:17.624 --> 19:18.789
It's fergus.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.392
Ps- he's taken
a vow of celibacy

19:21.394 --> 19:23.794
Since maxing out on ayahuasca
in peru, so good luck.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.229
I told you that
in confidence.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.931
I think that's
really admirable.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.065
Wow.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.200
I mean, whatevs.
I'm here for my cuz!

19:30.236 --> 19:31.802
Can we get back
to trivia?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.737
Oh my god,
hold your horses.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.273
Oh, that's a good one!

19:35.408 --> 19:37.107
How many horse actors
did they use

19:37.177 --> 19:39.543
In the 2003 snorefest
<i> seabiscuit?</i>

19:39.612 --> 19:40.912
(audience reactions)
ooh! Oh!

19:44.484 --> 19:48.753
♪ the escarpment
seems so pretty... ♪

19:48.888 --> 19:52.256
If you're looking
for fergross, he's downstairs.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.024
But don't try to help him
change the kegs.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.759
It makes him feel
emasculated.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.995
Well, lucky for him
I'm looking for you.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.563
I'm not gonna
make out with you.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.966
Nikki, I'm sorry
I got a little carried away

20:02.035 --> 20:03.634
At the flirt station

20:03.670 --> 20:05.903
But fergus isn't what I'm
gonna remember about today.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.437
He is
pretty forgettable.

20:07.473 --> 20:10.775
What I'm gonna remember
is watching you crush trivia.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.176
It was okay.

20:12.311 --> 20:13.778
You were amazing,
and I'm just sorry

20:13.913 --> 20:15.646
I didn't give you the
heads up about your mom.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.780
That's okay.

20:16.816 --> 20:17.915
I'm putting my drinks
on her card,

20:17.984 --> 20:19.182
So it works out.
Right.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.984
Thanks for the help
with the kegs,

20:21.020 --> 20:22.786
But I didn't need it.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.955
Peg:
Oh, I've changed
a few in my day.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.457
Worked at a diner
called the sweet potato.

20:26.592 --> 20:29.593
Ha! Had some pretty wild summers
there, I'll tell you.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.128
Oh my god, what are you
still doing here?

20:31.264 --> 20:33.197
Oh, well I walked it off,
like you said,

20:33.266 --> 20:35.733
But I didn't wanna go home
without giving the star

20:35.868 --> 20:38.269
Her opening night bouquet.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.603
Wool coasters?

20:39.606 --> 20:41.539
They're crochet
scrubbies, great for dry skin--

20:41.541 --> 20:43.540
Not that you have any.
You don't.

20:43.542 --> 20:44.908
We all know I do
so you're both lying.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.210
It's a nice gesture.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.613
Well, thanks for
the scrubbies.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.014
They're cute.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.249
Well, the pink one
really matches

20:52.252 --> 20:53.784
The shower cap
that I made you.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.452
I said
they were cute.

20:55.454 --> 20:56.953
Okay.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.222
She'll come around.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.891
Yeah, I just worry
about her sometimes.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.560
But she was great,
wasn't she?

21:02.562 --> 21:04.161
She was!

21:04.163 --> 21:05.896
Reminds me of a talent show I
did when I was working at--

21:06.032 --> 21:07.564
I swear to god, please
don't say the sweet potato.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.301
It was the jewel in
the port dalhousie crown!

21:10.436 --> 21:12.169
Oh my god,
can you both please go?

21:12.305 --> 21:13.037
Fine.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.438
Bye, fergus.
Bye, fergus.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.308
What a flirt, huh?

21:17.377 --> 21:19.844
Who knows what woulda happened
