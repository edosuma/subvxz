BOY Sneakers? Sneakers? Sneakers?

00:17.405 --> 00:19.973
Come here, Sneakers.

00:19.974 --> 00:22.742
Hey, Sneakers.

00:25.579 --> 00:27.413
Shit.

00:27.414 --> 00:29.482
Hey. Why are you not at my house?

00:29.483 --> 00:32.887
Uh... Uh, I am at your house.

00:32.888 --> 00:34.957
Don't lie to me, Ryan.
I have security cameras

00:34.958 --> 00:36.626
and I am looking at them online right now.

00:36.627 --> 00:39.130
Well, you said that the chairs Leo.

00:39.131 --> 00:41.298
weren't being delivered until 10:00, so...

00:41.299 --> 00:44.002
Which is why you should already
be there. I'll kill you!

00:44.003 --> 00:46.205
This fly's been acting like
a total dick all morning.

00:46.206 --> 00:47.607
This party's for important people.

00:47.608 --> 00:49.777
The kind of people who don't sit around

00:49.778 --> 00:51.946
in their underwear all day watching
TV with the neighbor's dog.

00:51.947 --> 00:53.916
Talking shit now, are ya?

00:55.618 --> 00:58.588
Uh... I'll be there in
15 minutes. I promise.

01:00.491 --> 01:02.392
Bitched out by Kristen.

01:02.393 --> 01:04.694
What a great way to start the day.

01:04.696 --> 01:07.798
Ryan, remember when I told you a few
weeks ago that you are a total pussy?

01:07.799 --> 01:09.500
Well, I just want to apologize

01:09.501 --> 01:11.668
for not emphasizing that enough.

01:11.669 --> 01:13.737
What am I going to do? Yell at her?

01:13.738 --> 01:16.140
She loaned me $5,000 for my car accident.

01:16.141 --> 01:18.008
Ryan, anger is like herpes.

01:18.009 --> 01:19.843
You're not meant to keep it to yourself.

01:19.844 --> 01:22.612
Exprngessing your angr
will make you feel better.

01:23.915 --> 01:25.983
Watch this.

01:25.984 --> 01:28.053
No...

01:28.054 --> 01:31.758
Die, you bloody bastard!

01:31.759 --> 01:33.459
Yeah!

01:37.565 --> 01:39.133
See?

01:39.134 --> 01:42.002
The fly's dead. I feel much better.

01:42.003 --> 01:44.738
No harm done whatsoever.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.011
Why aren't I going to Kristen's?
Kristen hates you.

01:51.012 --> 01:52.379
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.415
No one hates me.

01:54.416 --> 01:56.083
I'm Wilfred. I'm adorable.

01:56.084 --> 02:00.888
Look at these eyes, the smile.

02:00.889 --> 02:04.158
I onceck cracked a Nazi skinhed
in the face with a beer bottle,

02:04.159 --> 02:06.160
and you know what he did to me?

02:06.161 --> 02:07.361
Belly rub.

02:07.362 --> 02:09.030
Trust me, Kristen hates you.

02:09.031 --> 02:10.231
We'll see about that..

02:10.232 --> 02:11.966
I'm going.

02:11.967 --> 02:13.535
What's that?

02:13.536 --> 02:15.137
Binaca.

02:15.138 --> 02:16.672
I don't want my breath smelling like balls.

02:18.708 --> 02:21.811
Look, Leo, the chairare here.

02:21.812 --> 02:23.379
Wow, all these chairs and no throne?

02:23.380 --> 02:25.148
Where's Dr. Ramos going to sit?

02:25.149 --> 02:27.650
Leo thinks it's weird
that I'm throwing a party

02:27.651 --> 02:29.886
in honor of my boss. Because it is weird.

02:29.887 --> 02:32.522
Dr. Ramos just got a grant
to open a clinic in India,

02:32.523 --> 02:34.624
and he's looking for an associate
to oversee the project.

02:34.625 --> 02:37.027
See, Leo doesn't understand
that people actually get ahead

02:37.028 --> 02:38.428
by playing office politics.

02:38.429 --> 02:40.063
Which is, maybe,

02:40.064 --> 02:42.065
why he's still a claims
investigation supervisor.

02:42.066 --> 02:44.034
And maybe claims investigation supervisor's

02:44.035 --> 02:46.636
one of the most respected
titles in all of insurance.

02:46.637 --> 02:48.939
And maybe our therapist told you to
work on your passive-aggressive tone.

02:48.940 --> 02:50.674
Really? 'Cause maybe you ought to...

02:50.675 --> 02:52.577
Hey, Leo, it's nice to see you.

02:52.578 --> 02:54.946
Hey, Ryan.

02:54.947 --> 02:57.349
♪ Darling, you send me... ♪

02:57.350 --> 02:59.818
Kristen, shall I compare thee to a sunset?

02:59.819 --> 03:01.654
Morning dew? Flowers?

03:01.655 --> 03:02.989
♪ I know you send me... ♪ Blah, blah, blah?

03:02.990 --> 03:05.324
Some other beautiful shit?

03:05.325 --> 03:07.326
♪ Darling, you send me...
♪ The point is, you look good.

03:08.629 --> 03:11.297
Milady.

03:11.298 --> 03:13.799
Ew! Oh! Oh!

03:13.800 --> 03:15.501
God!

03:16.570 --> 03:18.938
My rat!

03:20.140 --> 03:21.941
You ungrateful bitch.

03:23.276 --> 03:25.711
Why'd you bring that stupid dog?

03:25.712 --> 03:27.546
You're even more obsessed with him

03:27.547 --> 03:29.715
than that stupid Jack Russell
you had when we were kids.

03:29.716 --> 03:31.918
Sneakers. He had a name.

03:31.919 --> 03:34.087
Great. The entrails fell out.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.522
Now it's worthless.

03:35.523 --> 03:37.624
Wait a minute.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.126
Where are the cushions?

03:39.127 --> 03:41.361
You didn't say anything about cushions.

03:41.362 --> 03:43.931
I didn't think I had to, Ryan,
on account of it being obvious.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.333
You know what, Kristen?

03:46.334 --> 03:49.036
Ah, yeah, that's it, get mad.

03:49.037 --> 03:50.338
You got something to say, Ryan?

03:52.040 --> 03:53.775
That was pathetic.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.877
You just grabbed your ankles and took it.

03:55.878 --> 03:57.545
No wonder she has no respect for you.

03:57.546 --> 03:59.313
She didn't treat you that well, either.

03:59.314 --> 04:02.817
Which was surprising, because I
thought everyone loves Wilfred.

04:02.818 --> 04:04.252
Everyone does--

04:04.253 --> 04:06.821
except her, because she's not human.

04:06.822 --> 04:09.557
Cold black heart, dead eyes.

04:09.558 --> 04:11.592
Nice tits.

04:11.593 --> 04:14.362
By the way, who's Sneakers?

04:14.363 --> 04:15.998
No one.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.735
<i>YOUNG RYAN Sneakers?</i>

04:19.736 --> 04:22.103
Sneakers?

04:22.105 --> 04:24.741
Come here, boy.

04:26.377 --> 04:27.878
Sneakers?

04:48.330 --> 04:51.699
Sneakers is no one, huh?

04:51.700 --> 04:54.335
Do you usually buy priceless
jewelry for no one?

04:55.871 --> 04:58.540
Imitation colored glass?

04:58.541 --> 05:00.809
Plastic painted to look like metal?

05:00.810 --> 05:03.478
This isn't some cheap,
made in China knockoff.

05:03.479 --> 05:06.482
This is made in Taiwan, you bastard.

05:06.483 --> 05:09.118
Keeping another dog on the side, are you?

05:09.119 --> 05:12.188
Sneakers was my dog 20 years ago.

05:12.189 --> 05:15.192
20 years, 20 minutes--
it makes no difference to me, Ryan.

05:15.193 --> 05:17.361
You know I have no concept of time.

05:17.362 --> 05:19.797
Well, I do, and it's 2:00 in the morning.

05:19.798 --> 05:22.100
I'm going back to bed.

05:22.101 --> 05:24.936
Damn it, why won't you
tell me about Sneakers?!

05:26.505 --> 05:29.139
Because I killed him! Okay?

05:31.408 --> 05:34.710
I killed him.

05:34.711 --> 05:37.546
Well...

05:37.547 --> 05:39.348
that's a relief.

05:39.349 --> 05:42.951
He was the sweetest little dog.

05:42.952 --> 05:47.189
He did these cute backflips.

05:47.190 --> 05:49.892
Every morning I'd wake up with him

05:49.893 --> 05:52.762
snuggled against me, licking my ear.

05:54.132 --> 05:55.732
Then one day

05:55.733 --> 05:58.736
I found Sneakers...

05:58.737 --> 06:01.839
floating in the pool.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.075
I left the gate open.

06:04.076 --> 06:06.277
I was always so careful.

06:07.646 --> 06:10.315
I killed my best friend.

06:10.316 --> 06:13.784
Snuggled up against you licking your ear?

06:13.785 --> 06:15.386
What, in the same bed?

06:15.387 --> 06:16.787
Where did you meet this budgie smuggler,

06:16.788 --> 06:18.288
a Maroon 5 concert?

06:18.289 --> 06:19.623
Don't be an asshole.

06:19.624 --> 06:21.658
It was a long time ago.

06:21.659 --> 06:25.462
Then I assume you won't mind if I wear this.

06:34.940 --> 06:37.475
Are you all right?

06:40.213 --> 06:42.915
Yeah. Yes.

06:42.916 --> 06:47.653
It's just a little chilly
down here, I guess.

06:47.654 --> 06:49.455
I'm going back to bed.

06:59.867 --> 07:01.133
Uh...

07:01.134 --> 07:02.368
Wilfred?

07:09.009 --> 07:10.209
That's not mine.

07:15.705 --> 07:17.606
All right, I've been thinking it over

07:17.607 --> 07:19.408
and I know what happened last night.

07:19.409 --> 07:22.178
After I went to sleep, you somehow managed

07:22.179 --> 07:25.080
to some sort of homo chip planted in my ain.

07:25.081 --> 07:26.715
You caught me.

07:26.716 --> 07:28.083
Let's go to the vet and get that removed.

07:28.084 --> 07:30.385
No, no vets. That won't be necessary.

07:30.386 --> 07:32.754
Wow, miraculous recovery.

07:34.958 --> 07:37.025
Hello.

07:37.026 --> 07:39.628
Don't forget to bring Mom's
old copper ice tub tonight.

07:39.629 --> 07:42.597
And remember to be here two
hours early to set up the bar.

07:42.598 --> 07:44.199
Oh, well, why not three?

07:44.200 --> 07:45.534
I really don't appreciate

07:45.535 --> 07:47.402
the attitude, Ryan. Sorry.

07:47.403 --> 07:49.504
This party's important to me.

07:49.505 --> 07:52.641
So just do your best, all right?

07:52.642 --> 07:54.376
I've got it.

07:54.377 --> 07:56.278
It wasn't a homo chip.

07:56.279 --> 07:58.313
It w a glowing orb of gayness,

07:58.314 --> 08:00.582
brought here by aliens that
you summoned, because...

08:00.583 --> 08:01.917
Stop. You know what I think?

08:01.918 --> 08:03.786
It's pretty coincidental

08:03.787 --> 08:06.389
that you suddenly start acting
like my old dog Sneakers.

08:06.390 --> 08:08.291
What? You think I'm acting?

08:08.292 --> 08:10.360
You tell me.

08:12.596 --> 08:16.832
Ryan, dogs are very empathic creatures.

08:16.833 --> 08:18.167
In fact, some cultures,

08:18.168 --> 08:20.602
the Hindus for example,

08:20.603 --> 08:23.738
they believe that we
dogs can help the living

08:23.739 --> 08:25.839
communicate with the dead.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.842
Are you saying that the ghost of my dead dog

08:28.843 --> 08:30.244
is trying to possess your body?

08:30.245 --> 08:33.013
Dude, can you blame him?

08:33.014 --> 08:35.349
The glowing orb of gayness
is more believable than that.

08:35.350 --> 08:38.318
Ryan, it's true. And I can prove it.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.888
But first, we must cross over

08:40.889 --> 08:42.623
to the other side.

08:46.161 --> 08:48.129
The other side of the room?

08:48.130 --> 08:49.931
Yeah, I dropped my guts over there.

08:49.932 --> 08:51.299
That's going to reek. Sorry, mate.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.734
Wait!

08:52.735 --> 08:54.236
We're going to uncover the mysteries

08:54.237 --> 08:55.904
of the afterlife, Ryan.

08:55.905 --> 08:58.140
The secrets of the dead.

08:58.141 --> 09:03.011
And we'll do it all with the
most sacred tool of dark magic!

09:04.747 --> 09:05.848
S...

09:07.484 --> 09:09.585
H...

09:09.586 --> 09:10.920
M...

09:10.921 --> 09:13.189
E...

09:13.190 --> 09:15.524
Wash me...

09:15.525 --> 09:17.559
Wash me?

09:17.560 --> 09:20.329
Oh, very funny, Bear. I could feel
you pushing it the whole time.

09:20.330 --> 09:22.197
Ryan, can you come over here?

09:22.198 --> 09:23.598
I need someone who's going
to take this seriously.

09:23.599 --> 09:25.199
I don't have time for this nonsense.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.734
I have to get to Kristen's. Nonsense?

09:26.735 --> 09:29.336
Can't you feel the
tormented souls around us?

09:29.337 --> 09:31.904
Gary Coleman, is that you?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.740
What do you mean,
what am I talking about...?

09:33.741 --> 09:35.240
Oh, I get it.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.909
Ah-hah!

09:36.910 --> 09:39.912
Kristen's old swim goggles.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.647
What's this doing here?

09:46.186 --> 09:49.555
Hi, Ryan. It's me.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.290
That isn't funny, Wilfred.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.793
Wilfred? Gosh, golly,

09:53.794 --> 09:55.995
don't you recognize your old buddy Sneakers?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.730
I'm not kidding. Cut the shit.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.998
Yippity-do!

09:58.999 --> 10:00.366
Want to go have a snuggle?

10:00.367 --> 10:01.834
Or watch me do

10:01.835 --> 10:03.535
one of my neat-o backflips?

10:03.536 --> 10:05.070
Give me that collar.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.172
What's wrong, Ryan? Are you still mad at me

10:07.173 --> 10:10.576
for chewing the feet off
your footie pajamas?

10:10.577 --> 10:12.812
Remember? The ones with the
race cars all over them?

10:12.813 --> 10:15.181
Sneakers?

10:15.182 --> 10:17.784
Ryan, I know you feel bad about how I died,

10:17.785 --> 10:19.686
but it wasn't your fault.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.689
I left the gate open.

10:21.690 --> 10:23.157
Nuh-uh. It was Kristen.

10:23.158 --> 10:24.626
What?

10:24.627 --> 10:26.762
Wilfred, I swear, if this is just you...

10:26.763 --> 10:29.031
It was all her fault.

10:29.032 --> 10:32.368
And she let you live with
the guilt for 20 years.

10:32.369 --> 10:37.006
Guilt that made you a sad, sad boy.

10:37.007 --> 10:39.108
You know, in the back of my mind

10:39.109 --> 10:40.676
I always thought that maybe she...

10:40.677 --> 10:42.277
She did.

10:42.278 --> 10:44.246
Maybe we should go over to her house

10:44.247 --> 10:47.315
and make her a sad, sad girl.

10:47.316 --> 10:50.518
Maybe we should punch her tits off.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.887
You can be a real bastard, Wilfred.

10:52.888 --> 10:55.557
Wilfred? You're just mad at Kristen,
because she doesn't like you,

10:55.558 --> 10:57.626
so you want me to be mad at her, too.

10:57.627 --> 10:58.894
This is sick.

10:58.895 --> 11:00.763
Ryan, I don't understand...

11:02.733 --> 11:05.502
Four score and seven years ago...

11:07.505 --> 11:10.741
Oh, God, what just happened?

11:12.544 --> 11:14.311
That man is not the real Magic Johnson.

11:14.312 --> 11:17.580
I died in 1992.
That guy looks nothing like me.

11:19.216 --> 11:21.417
Are you really sick?

11:21.418 --> 11:25.120
Or are you just faking it so you can
come over here and mess with Kristen?

11:25.121 --> 11:27.022
Have a bit of sympathy, mate.

11:27.023 --> 11:29.024
I just had a terrifying
paranormal experience.

11:29.025 --> 11:32.161
My stomach's in knots, my head's pounding.

11:32.162 --> 11:34.930
I asked you to bring
Mom's antique copper tub.

11:34.931 --> 11:36.465
This is tin.

11:36.466 --> 11:38.334
Ryan strikes again. It's the only one

11:38.335 --> 11:39.568
in the basement.

11:39.569 --> 11:41.404
There's a basement?

11:41.405 --> 11:43.006
Kristen, hey, I think

11:43.007 --> 11:44.474
we just got off on the wrong foot yesterday.

11:44.475 --> 11:46.877
No. Why would you bring him?
I couldn't leave him alone.

11:46.878 --> 11:48.446
He's not feeling well.

11:48.447 --> 11:51.149
Just promise me he won't shit
on the lawn or do anything...

12:01.125 --> 12:02.526
Sorry.

12:02.527 --> 12:04.060
I'll hose it off right away.

12:04.061 --> 12:06.296
Just leave it. I'll eat it later.

12:06.297 --> 12:08.598
I'm going to go rinse my
mouth out in the toilet.

12:12.302 --> 12:15.037
Hey, I was thinking...

12:15.038 --> 12:17.907
Do you remember the day I
found Sneakers in the pool?

12:17.908 --> 12:20.210
I guess. Why?

12:20.211 --> 12:22.446
Well, we always thought I was the one

12:22.447 --> 12:24.381
who left the gate open, but I was wondering,

12:24.382 --> 12:25.850
is it possible that maybe...

12:25.851 --> 12:27.886
Maybe what?

12:27.887 --> 12:30.422
Maybe it-it was you?

12:30.423 --> 12:32.424
Oh.

12:32.425 --> 12:35.561
One hour and 48 minutes before my big party,

12:35.562 --> 12:37.562
and you decide to accuse me

12:37.563 --> 12:39.665
of killing that backflipping little idiot?

12:39.666 --> 12:41.567
You know what, Ryan?

12:41.568 --> 12:43.369
Sometimes you can be really insensitive.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.008
Hey!

12:50.009 --> 12:52.477
Kristen may be a bitch,
but she'd never let me believe

12:52.478 --> 12:55.714
I killed my dog all these
years if it wasn't true.

12:55.715 --> 12:58.583
I don't know why I listen to you.
Me? I didn't say anything.

12:58.584 --> 13:01.052
It was Sneakers,
and he's got no reason to lie.

13:01.053 --> 13:03.354
Will you stop with this paranormal bullshit.

13:03.355 --> 13:04.822
You don't believe me?

13:04.823 --> 13:06.958
Call her out on her lies.

13:06.959 --> 13:09.594
Get the truth, and get angry for once.

13:09.595 --> 13:11.730
Just stop. She doesn't like you--
deal with it.

13:11.731 --> 13:14.366
I'm not going to ruin her party,
and neither are you.

13:14.367 --> 13:15.934
I'm locking you in the car, Wilfred.

13:19.740 --> 13:21.207
Wilfred?

13:21.208 --> 13:23.843
Wilfred's not here anymore.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.811
There's only Sneakers.

13:25.812 --> 13:29.048
And I won't rest until Kristen
gets what's coming to her.

13:29.049 --> 13:31.851
In the car, now. Okay. Race you there.

13:43.508 --> 13:45.543
And after six minutes of infant CPR,

13:45.544 --> 13:47.277
I looked into the baby's eyes,

13:47.278 --> 13:50.914
and I said, "You live, now."

13:50.915 --> 13:53.150
That exact moment, the baby just

13:53.151 --> 13:56.053
stared right back at me,
with his big, brown eyes

13:56.054 --> 13:58.388
as if to say, "Thank you."

13:58.389 --> 14:00.590
And took his first breath.

14:00.591 --> 14:02.092
Oh!

14:02.093 --> 14:04.061
And that's when I vowed

14:04.062 --> 14:06.029
I'd someday return to that village

14:06.030 --> 14:08.231
- and open a clinic.
- Let me get this straight.

14:08.232 --> 14:11.702
An obstetrician delivered
a baby without killing it?

14:14.205 --> 14:16.774
Oh, look, honey, it's the Davidsons.

14:16.775 --> 14:18.876
Don't forget to check out
the chocolate fountain.

14:20.845 --> 14:23.080
Really?

14:23.081 --> 14:25.549
Okay, that's it-- Leo is cut off.

14:25.550 --> 14:28.819
Could this party get any worse?

14:28.820 --> 14:30.354
You put that dog away, right?

14:30.355 --> 14:31.789
He's in the car.

14:31.790 --> 14:33.224
He won't bother anyone from there.

14:35.294 --> 14:36.961
Uh...

14:36.962 --> 14:39.230
I should go check on him. Are you kidding?

14:39.231 --> 14:40.531
Ryan?!

14:53.009 --> 14:54.743
Oh, no.

15:00.616 --> 15:02.716
What the hell, Ryan.

15:02.717 --> 15:05.552
I just had to pour Dr. Ramos
a glass of Chardonnay myself.

15:05.553 --> 15:07.121
Do you know how that looks?

15:07.122 --> 15:08.256
Sorry. I just need a second.

15:08.257 --> 15:09.691
No. Just get back to the bar.

15:13.930 --> 15:15.697
Oh, my God! What happened?!

15:15.698 --> 15:17.633
A dog knocked over the table.

15:17.634 --> 15:19.302
A dog? I'll take care of it.

15:25.911 --> 15:26.911
Ryan!

15:26.912 --> 15:29.113
Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.761
Ew! Oh, my God!

15:46.762 --> 15:48.329
Ah, stop!

15:48.330 --> 15:50.264
Wilfred!

15:50.265 --> 15:52.767
Look at how she laughs, Ryan.

15:52.768 --> 15:54.736
Oh, God. A crazy night.

15:54.737 --> 15:55.970
I can't laugh like that,

15:55.971 --> 15:59.240
because my lungs are filled with water.

15:59.241 --> 16:02.309
I don't believe you. You're just doing
this 'cause Kristen doesn't like you.

16:02.310 --> 16:05.546
No, I'm doing this to make
that bitch pay for killing me.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.114
Yippity-do!

16:10.051 --> 16:12.652
Watch out!

16:14.055 --> 16:16.622
Oh, my God! Oh, I'm so sorry!

16:16.623 --> 16:19.492
I'm so sorry!

16:19.493 --> 16:22.895
- What happened?
- Oh! I'm sorry.

16:22.896 --> 16:24.530
Oh, God.

16:43.985 --> 16:45.019
Oh, my God. Did you see that?

16:45.020 --> 16:46.220
Get her a towel.

16:46.221 --> 16:47.221
WILFRED Where am I?

16:48.624 --> 16:50.358
Oh, God.

16:50.359 --> 16:52.126
Here it comes.

16:56.799 --> 16:59.968
It's okay. I swallowed it.

17:01.203 --> 17:04.005
Kristen, I'm so sorry.

17:04.006 --> 17:05.506
Sorry?

17:05.507 --> 17:06.641
You ruined my party, Ryan.

17:06.642 --> 17:08.142
The Ramoses left.

17:08.143 --> 17:09.977
That dog is a four-legged piece of shit.

17:09.978 --> 17:11.378
Hey, take it easy on Wilfred.

17:11.380 --> 17:13.681
God, you talk about him like he's a person.

17:13.682 --> 17:15.884
I am so tired of dealing
with that stupid dog.

17:15.885 --> 17:17.819
Ever since he came here... Shut up!

17:17.819 --> 17:19.488
Just shut the hell up! What?

17:19.489 --> 17:22.157
I am sick of taking your shit!

17:22.159 --> 17:25.896
Ever since we were kids, it's like
you get off on treating me like crap.

17:25.896 --> 17:28.865
Like when Sneakers died--
you kept rubbing my face in it.

17:28.866 --> 17:31.168
Don't you think I felt guilty enough?

17:35.507 --> 17:38.075
Kristen?

17:38.076 --> 17:40.477
I left it open.

17:40.478 --> 17:42.279
What?

17:42.280 --> 17:45.115
I came home to get my
goggles for swim practice

17:45.116 --> 17:46.884
and I left the gate open.

17:46.885 --> 17:48.252
Goggles...

17:48.253 --> 17:50.120
It was me.

17:50.121 --> 17:53.190
How could you let me live
with that guilt for 20 years?

17:53.191 --> 17:54.792
I don't know.

17:54.793 --> 17:57.161
You know, Mom and Dad always liked you more.

17:57.162 --> 17:59.563
You were always sweet and creative.

17:59.564 --> 18:02.600
And I was always the uptight
little girl everyone avoided.

18:02.601 --> 18:04.101
Even Sneakers liked you more than me.

18:04.102 --> 18:05.369
And you know what?

18:05.370 --> 18:06.938
He was supposed to be my dog.

18:06.939 --> 18:08.239
Remember?

18:08.240 --> 18:10.574
I got him for my birthday.

18:10.575 --> 18:12.843
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

18:12.844 --> 18:15.012
Can you forgive me?

18:15.013 --> 18:17.315
I don't know.

18:17.316 --> 18:22.019
What if I forget about the
rest of the $5,000 you owe me?

18:22.020 --> 18:24.488
You want to pay me off?

18:24.489 --> 18:25.990
Yeah.

18:28.260 --> 18:30.227
I guess it's a start.

18:34.967 --> 18:37.702
I'm so glad you finally know the truth.

18:37.703 --> 18:39.437
I have been walking around with this

18:39.438 --> 18:41.239
for so long.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.108
I guess that's why I get
so upset around Wilfred.

18:44.109 --> 18:45.543
You know, I don't really hate him.

18:45.544 --> 18:47.445
And there it is.

18:47.446 --> 18:49.547
She loves me.

18:49.548 --> 18:51.016
I knew it the whole time.

18:51.017 --> 18:52.751
It's so obvious.

18:52.752 --> 18:55.288
Do you think he'd let me pet him?

18:59.493 --> 19:02.496
Hey, Wilfred. You're such a sweet...

19:02.497 --> 19:04.465
Piss off!

19:04.466 --> 19:07.034
Ryan...

19:09.003 --> 19:11.138
What? I still hate the bitch.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.674
Hey, Ryan, it's me again.

19:20.675 --> 19:22.242
Yippity-do.

19:22.243 --> 19:25.179
Seriously? Aren't we done with this?

19:25.180 --> 19:27.214
I'm just here to say good-bye.

19:27.215 --> 19:28.983
Now that you're no longer carrying

19:28.984 --> 19:32.386
the guilt of my death,
I can finally rest in peace.

19:32.387 --> 19:33.954
Cool. See ya.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.756
Wait.

19:35.757 --> 19:39.359
I was hoping we could have one last snuggle.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.361
No, thanks.

19:41.362 --> 19:42.762
Please?

19:42.763 --> 19:44.730
And then I'll never bother you again.

19:54.774 --> 19:56.408
Close your eyes.
