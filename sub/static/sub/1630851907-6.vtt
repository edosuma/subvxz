WEBVTT

00:12.971 --> 00:13.847
What are you doing?

00:13.930 --> 00:15.807
I'm getting my tongue into licking shape

00:15.890 --> 00:19.394
so we can do cunnilingus on Ali
the second she walks through that door.

00:19.477 --> 00:22.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I only had one fantasy about kissing her.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.191
Yeah.
And they have a really special friendship

00:25.275 --> 00:26.401
that we don't want to ruin.

00:26.484 --> 00:27.610
Oh, come on.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.989
You can't ruin a friendship with sex.
That's a myth.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.323
Oh, shit, she's here.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.868
Ooh, showtime. Eat out your friend!

00:34.951 --> 00:36.911
Or maybe just say hello.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.288
Ali, hi!

00:38.371 --> 00:40.832
Jessi! Since last week sucked ass,

00:40.915 --> 00:43.043
I got you a Frappuccino
just how you like it.

00:43.126 --> 00:46.212
Iced chocolate, ten pumps of caramel,
no coffee, extra whip.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.006
Oh, my God, you know me so well!

00:48.089 --> 00:50.550
Chill, bitch.
I'm obviously drinking half of that.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.428
-You guys, Ali has my order memorized.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.388
Michael Angelo didn't even know
my last name.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.807
Will you shut the fuck up!
She's taking off her clothes!

00:57.891 --> 01:00.143
Oh, my God, what do I do? Do I look?
I wanna look.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.561
Should I look away? What's normal?

01:01.644 --> 01:03.396
See, Connie? You're freaking her out.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.357
But I'm completely
transfixed by the boobies!

01:06.441 --> 01:08.151
-Hello? Earth to Jessi!

01:08.234 --> 01:10.278
Oh, right. Right. "Earth to Jessi."

01:10.361 --> 01:13.490
I love our planet. The Earth.
Even more than the moon.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.574
Who needs that?

01:14.657 --> 01:17.035
-"Houston, we have a Starbucks."

01:17.118 --> 01:20.997
You funny. Now drink the fucking frappe.
I spent my life savings on that shit.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.583
Ooh! This does feel a little different.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.753
Fuck! I'm totally crushing
on my best friend.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.964
All this and more
on Connie Lingus Tonight.

02:16.094 --> 02:19.806
Dude, can I just say,
I love being your sidepiece.

02:19.889 --> 02:24.144
I get to be blackout horny 24/7
with no strings attached?

02:25.186 --> 02:26.688
-Yes, please!
-Yeah, whatever.

02:26.771 --> 02:31.484
And having no emotional connection
gives me so much time to myself.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.736
Did I tell you I'm thinking about
opening a restaurant?

02:33.820 --> 02:37.198
It's sliders, but they're bigger,
like hamburger-size!

02:37.282 --> 02:39.409
Hang back
so nobody sees us leave together.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.704
Yep, the sidepiece life is pretty awesome.

02:42.787 --> 02:46.374
Way better than being recognized
as a human being.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.042
Sidepiece wolf!

02:49.335 --> 02:51.254
Shit. I don't want to go in there!

02:51.337 --> 02:52.172
Oh, come on.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.674
I'm sure everybody forgot
about Jessi screaming

02:54.757 --> 02:56.968
that she doesn't want to date you,
isn't into you,

02:57.051 --> 03:01.014
and you'll never,
under any circumstances, make her horny.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.224
Oh, well,
you seem to remember it verbatim.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.934
Oh, honey, I forget nothing.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.562
Oh, shit.
Nick, you came back to school

03:07.645 --> 03:10.481
after Jessi basically
cut your dick off in front of everybody?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.150
-Oh, fuck!

03:12.233 --> 03:16.362
Okay, my sweet birdies,
let's be gentle with our dear friend Nick,

03:16.446 --> 03:18.656
for his fragile heart
hath been torn asunder.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.491
What are you doing? I don't like this.

03:20.575 --> 03:24.287
Last week, I was sensitive and kind
to my dad, and he almost hugged me.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.748
So this is my new personality. Enjoy.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.416
He's Tender Andrew now.

03:28.499 --> 03:32.921
Sensitive yet fuckable,
like my hormone monster friend, Simon Sex.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.298
-"Simon Sex." He sounds--
-Sexy?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.008
No, I was gonna say made up.

03:37.091 --> 03:41.429
Oh, he's very real and very sexy,
but he's also a beautiful soul.

03:41.512 --> 03:44.432
We spent most of the '70s
eating magic mushrooms together

03:44.515 --> 03:46.726
and masturbating in an open field.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.187
Yo, Nick.
If you're feeling shitty about Jessi,

03:49.270 --> 03:51.606
what you need is a boys' night out.

03:51.689 --> 03:53.691
That's what I did
after my child divorce from Devin.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.486
Oh, yeah! Real men,
we take that heartbreak

03:56.569 --> 03:59.948
and we make it wait in the closet
for 20 minutes…

04:00.031 --> 04:02.033
…while we walk away.

04:02.116 --> 04:04.369
-Right, Charles?
-Yeah, whatever.

04:04.452 --> 04:09.082
Picture it, bro, I'm telling you.
A night for guys to just be guys.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.542
We're all drunk off of vanilla vodka.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.836
No mixers 'cause we're big boys now.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.630
Beautiful women, fast cars.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.465
Everybody's got a fucking sword.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.133
Oh, oh, and Vin Diesel's there.

04:19.217 --> 04:22.053
I like to sing karaoke on Facebook.

04:22.136 --> 04:28.768
Would any of you tall adult men like
a bite of sushi off my hard, heavy tits?

04:28.851 --> 04:32.272
Hey, sushi's for vegetarian cucks!
Eat me!

04:32.355 --> 04:34.274
-Yeah!

04:35.483 --> 04:37.402
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.
Stop picturing that.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.445
I propose an alternative evening.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.990
Dreamweave with me,
just for a moment, baby boy.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.534
Ugh, why is your whisper so wet?

04:44.617 --> 04:49.330
Because my mouth's
got the hots for a boys' night in.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.793
What I propose
is an evening for men to mend,

04:53.876 --> 04:54.919
by looking inward.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.839
We'll share our secrets
and travel back to infancy,

04:57.922 --> 05:00.508
then celebrate our growth
with a communal orgasm…

05:00.591 --> 05:02.719
-…a group drain, if you will,

05:02.802 --> 05:05.430
-crying and cumming, crying and cumming…

05:05.513 --> 05:07.765
-…in an upsetting crescendo.

05:07.849 --> 05:11.978
That sounds hard, boring, gay and sweaty.
Nick, do my thing instead.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.522
I mean, being vulnerable
has gotten me nowhere.

05:14.605 --> 05:19.068
And it would be a relief
to not think about Jessi for a night.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.113
I like the one
where the boys eat the cowboy steak.

05:22.196 --> 05:25.533
Okay, I'm gonna go with Devon's
fun plan instead of Andrew's bad one.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.119
Hell yeah!
I know the perfect place to go tonight.

05:28.202 --> 05:33.249
Oh, Andrew, I'm sorry they didn't like
your hard, boring, gay, sweaty idea.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.500
Oh, don't worry, Maury.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.670
By hook or by crook,
there will be a group drain tonight.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.381
The floor will be slick
with tears and cum.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.884
Oh, you know who loves tears and cum?

05:42.967 --> 05:45.261
Simon Sex. I'm gonna invite him.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.181
I think the audience
would like to see who I'm talking about.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.435
Hi! Hello! You're everything to me.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.730
Hi! Hello! You're everything to me.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.900
And that's how you do
two-person fart starters.

05:58.983 --> 06:03.946
-Hi! Hello. You're everything to me.
-She's flirting with you!

06:04.030 --> 06:05.615
Spread her knees and dive in there!

06:05.698 --> 06:07.700
Wait, though. Is that even what I want?

06:07.784 --> 06:11.162
Hell yeah! We can go from
flirtin' to squirtin' in a lick of a clit.

06:11.245 --> 06:14.290
Ugh, Connie, I don't know if I should have
chugged a whole Frappuccino

06:14.374 --> 06:16.042
and then done a bunch of sit-ups.

06:16.125 --> 06:19.962
-Hi. Hello. You're everything to me.
-Miss you already.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.049
-Bye! Ugh.
-They are the worst, aren't they?

06:23.132 --> 06:25.843
-Yeah, they think they're so cool!
-Totally.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.303
Wait, who said that?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.262
I did!

06:28.346 --> 06:30.681
Oh, my gosh, you're very cute.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.850
Aw, thanks, I'm Rochelle.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.018
That's a beautiful name.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.311
You know who's not cute?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.814
-Those fucking bitches.
-Oh, wow. Okay, uh, well,

06:37.897 --> 06:40.817
I don't know if I'd call them B-words
in the light of day--

06:40.900 --> 06:41.901
Well, I would.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.695
What they did to you at your
affinity group meeting was horrible.

06:44.779 --> 06:45.655
You were there?

06:45.738 --> 06:49.659
All right, you guys, let's get to work
making the world a better place.

06:49.742 --> 06:53.621
Screw that! Who wants to do our idea
instead of Missy's dorky bullshit?

06:53.704 --> 06:57.458
I'm a white co-opter
and I love every fucking second of it!

06:57.542 --> 06:58.709
-Yeah!

06:58.793 --> 07:01.295
You're not keeping track of my sit-ups.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.588
Oh, sorry, Caleb.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.341
Was the affinity meeting really that bad?

07:05.425 --> 07:08.428
Yes, it was, and you don't deserve
to be treated like that.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.680
You deserve early admission to Wellesley

07:10.763 --> 07:13.349
and a boyfriend with a thick, hard ass.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.809
Ooh! Ah!

07:14.892 --> 07:17.437
From your lips
to Idris Elba's thick, hard ass.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.691
You guys, this is really confusing.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.901
I've never been
attracted to a girl before.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.736
Is it possible you're a lesbian?

07:25.820 --> 07:27.572
You mean, like my mom?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.699
Nope, you definitely like guys too.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.951
Judd makes your goosh go sploosh.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.246
Hello! Yoo-hoo!
Don't talk about me like I'm not here!

07:35.329 --> 07:37.665
-Oh! Hey, there, Jessi's vagina!
-Oh, boy.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.710
While it's true Judd's a real me-wetter…

07:40.793 --> 07:44.589
…when you were holding Ali's ankles,
I got a full body buzz on, girl!

07:44.672 --> 07:47.341
Jessi, you got a funny snatch.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.427
Oh, my God, thank you!

07:49.510 --> 07:53.931
I am in a sketch group with Jessi's taint,
her butt hole, and Kegel-Michael Key.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.851
But honey, getting romantic
with your best friend?

07:56.934 --> 07:59.687
That's a lot more complicated
than you think.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.355
Uh-uh-uh, I disagree.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.524
To try and fuck your best friend?

08:03.608 --> 08:06.402
Why, it's the most beautiful
and natural thing

08:06.486 --> 08:07.695
in the whole wide world.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.447
-Really?
-As a matter of fact,

08:09.530 --> 08:12.617
I might have penned
a little song about this.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.436
Ew!

09:43.124 --> 09:46.627
-Oh, damn, Connie, that was beautiful!
-Thank you!

09:46.711 --> 09:50.214
So, does it make you want
to suck face with your best friend? Hmm?

09:50.298 --> 09:52.300
Not gonna lie, it kind of does.

09:52.383 --> 09:56.012
If you play the song backwards, it makes
everyone in the room want to eat ass.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.265
Eat the ass
and worship Santa.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.391
No way!

10:00.474 --> 10:03.227
-Jesus! This place is creepy.

10:03.311 --> 10:06.188
Well, you'll either come out
of this night feeling better,

10:06.272 --> 10:08.524
or you'll be murdered by a drifter.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.777
And I bet Jessi would
feel terrible if you died.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.113
Yeah, that'll show her!

10:14.196 --> 10:18.618
Nick! Welcome to a badass night
of male debauchery.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.453
-Hey, Nick!
-Fuck your feelings.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.288
-We're breakin' shit.
-Yeah!

10:22.371 --> 10:23.539
-Ooh, rats!

10:23.623 --> 10:25.583
Hey, well, this place is, uh…

10:25.666 --> 10:28.502
-It's awesome, right?
-What's, uh, with the sledgehammer?

10:28.586 --> 10:30.713
We're about to smash shit like men.

10:30.796 --> 10:31.672
I brought knives.

10:31.756 --> 10:36.344
And I came separately from Charles
and brought capes and condoms!

10:36.427 --> 10:40.723
Uh, I wheeled over a tub of my mom's
signature recipe, Lump soup.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.352
It's two parts nacho cheese
and one part Sunny D.

10:44.435 --> 10:47.563
-Ho, ho, ho! Bad boys know how to party.

10:49.398 --> 10:52.860
Whoa! Where'd you get
those killer threads, Tender Andy?

10:52.943 --> 10:57.114
My mom got them for a trip to Arizona
that she did not take.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.659
-Where'd you get yours?
-He got them from me.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.661
-Oh, wow. Hello!
-Hi.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.371
Simon Sex, I presume?

11:03.454 --> 11:07.917
Guilty as charged, but the only crime
I've committed is being open to love.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.004
We were also convicted for jerking off
onto the grass at Wimbledon.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.090
Oh, yes. Forgot that.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.509
Now go, Andrew, show those boys that

11:16.592 --> 11:19.595
even though society
doesn't want them to be vulnerable,

11:19.679 --> 11:22.848
tenderness can be very powerful…
…and sexy.

11:22.932 --> 11:26.686
Well, if you professional perverts
say this is the move, I'm in.

11:26.769 --> 11:27.937
-Hello, boys!

11:28.020 --> 11:31.273
I hope you're ready to uncork…
…those hearts of yours,

11:31.357 --> 11:34.193
because I brought a bottle
of "Mommy's Little Helper."

11:34.276 --> 11:36.362
-Oh, yeah!
-Where did you get wine?

11:36.445 --> 11:39.782
Oh, ho, I have a mustache, Nick.
They'll sell me rosé.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.076
Ooh, let's get fucked up!

11:42.159 --> 11:43.077
No, no, no. Hey!

11:43.160 --> 11:47.039
Before you take a sip,
you must share one "I feel" statement.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.251
I feel this sucks!

11:50.334 --> 11:52.670
Okay, big tough guys, I'll start.

11:52.753 --> 11:57.174
I feel tremulous because my dear friend
Nick, who I love, I love a boy,

11:57.258 --> 12:00.302
is clearly suffering
and he won't open his petals.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.430
Nick, your turn.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.265
All right, I feel

12:04.348 --> 12:07.810
like I wanna smash a toilet
with Devon's sledgehammer!

12:09.145 --> 12:14.233
Yes! Smashing stuff is so much better
than feeling your sad, pathetic feelings.

12:14.316 --> 12:15.609
You're such a little man.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.820
-Fuck yeah!

12:17.903 --> 12:18.988
Rip out a sink!

12:19.071 --> 12:20.197
Fuck up a tub!

12:20.281 --> 12:23.033
Look for the cookies
that I hid in the wall!

12:23.117 --> 12:26.662
If anyone is seeking respite
from the shackles of masculinity,

12:26.746 --> 12:29.457
the tenderness station is now open.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.751
-Whoa! Not kind!

12:31.834 --> 12:34.336
-Look at all those hearts in the caption.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.757
What kind of twisted shit you think
happened between Ali and Jessi in jail?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.134
What exactly are you implying?

12:40.217 --> 12:42.553
I'm just saying,
they went to jail together,

12:42.636 --> 12:45.139
and then soon as they got out,
Ali broke up with Samira.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.056
You do the math.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.017
Oh, so you think--

12:48.100 --> 12:50.269
Jessi totally
hooked up with Ali in jail.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.187
It's obvious.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.440
Samira and Ali were together
for three months.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.984
In middle school time,
that's like four months.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.361
Exactly. Jessi's a messy bitch,

12:59.445 --> 13:01.864
a menace to society,
and she needs to be stopped.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.241
-So if I told everyone

13:04.325 --> 13:05.618
that she hooked up with Ali,

13:05.701 --> 13:08.120
I'd be doing a service,
like a whistleblower!

13:08.204 --> 13:11.207
Yes! The bravest thing
you can do is post it online

13:11.290 --> 13:12.500
from an anonymous account.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.710
-Way ahead of you!

13:14.794 --> 13:17.129
"Dr. PlainTalk." Okay!

13:17.213 --> 13:20.466
-Jailbirds? More like lovebirds.
-Mm-hmm!

13:20.549 --> 13:25.137
These two criminals
had an erotic dalliance in jail.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.516
-Ooh, girl!
-What does poor Samira think of all this?

13:28.599 --> 13:32.937
-Preach!

13:35.231 --> 13:37.024
Wow, you're good at this.

13:37.107 --> 13:40.361
Now, press send,
and end Jessi's reign of terror.

13:40.444 --> 13:43.656
But we know that
this is probably not true, right?

13:43.739 --> 13:45.741
Who cares? She sucks!

13:45.825 --> 13:48.077
She does suck. Eat it, B-word!

13:48.160 --> 13:49.411
Go, bitch. Go!

13:49.495 --> 13:52.998
-Air this bitch out!

13:53.082 --> 13:53.916
Hey, babe?

13:53.999 --> 13:55.960
-What are you thinking right now?
-Dude.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.253
We just never talk.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.963
What's your family like?

13:59.046 --> 14:01.507
-Do you feel safe with them?
-Safe?

14:01.590 --> 14:05.511
I just thought maybe because we keep
stuffing our tongues into each other,

14:05.594 --> 14:09.890
I--I don't know, we might want to try
stuffing our feelings into each other?

14:09.974 --> 14:12.268
-That could be hot too, right?
-Nah, I'm good.

14:12.351 --> 14:16.146
Okay, uh, yeah, I'm good too.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.399
I'm just gonna
hang back here like you like.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.900
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.236
Fuck my bitch ex-wife.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.989
$14 a month in alimony?

14:25.072 --> 14:29.201
Fuck that guy at Foot Locker
who said I have irregular feet!

14:29.285 --> 14:31.036
-Fuck Jessi!

14:31.120 --> 14:35.624
-How dare she reject you over and over!

14:35.708 --> 14:37.209
She's not better than me!

14:37.293 --> 14:39.712
Yes! Keep poking the wall with your--

14:39.795 --> 14:42.840
with your weird little sword
until you believe that.

14:42.923 --> 14:43.757
Oh!

14:43.841 --> 14:46.302
Well, it's official.
Put it on the marquee.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.471
None of these boys want to be
soothed by my tenderness.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.224
-It's like they refuse to look inward.
-Heartbreakingly true.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.934
I like to look inward sometimes.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.979
I hold a mirror up to my butt hole.
I can see all the way to my tummy.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.480
-Hold on. What's that?

14:58.564 --> 15:01.400
It's Jay. He's crying like a little bitch.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.110
Maury, the real little bitch

15:03.193 --> 15:07.489
is the boy who doesn't offer comfort
to him in his time of need.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.700
Should I try a little tenderness?

15:09.783 --> 15:11.660
Or a little mushrooms, that's what we did.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.412
Uh, I think I'll do the tenderness.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.081
Hey, if you don't want to eat
powerful hallucinogens

15:16.165 --> 15:18.751
with a couple of hormone monsters,
that's cool.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.003
Plus, we ate 'em all, so…

15:26.133 --> 15:28.260
Jeez, I can't get
that song out of my head.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.262
You can't get Ali out of your head.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.139
I can't get her
out of my head either!

15:32.222 --> 15:34.391
I'm sorry, but do vaginas even have heads?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.727
Of course!
I have my own little vagina too.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.771
And I have an even littler vagina.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.357
-This could go on forever!

15:41.440 --> 15:43.567
You know what else could go on forever?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.736
Your love for Ali!

15:45.819 --> 15:47.947
-What the hell is that?
-It's a love scope.

15:48.030 --> 15:53.243
You look into it and see what your
love life could be like in the future!

15:53.327 --> 15:55.496
Hey, hon. I got us both suits and sneakers

15:55.579 --> 15:57.915
for that radical
social justice event tomorrow.

15:57.998 --> 16:01.210
Ooh! From President Megan Rapinoe's
new streetwear brand?

16:01.293 --> 16:02.544
You Rapin-know it, babe.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.671
God, I love you.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.840
I'm gonna eat you out
so attentively tonight.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.509
Not if I eat you out first.

16:08.592 --> 16:12.012
Wait a minute, what if
we eat each other out at the same time?

16:12.096 --> 16:15.349
Okay, you're a vagenius.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.437
-Wow! The future looks amazing.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.731
Hey, you in there? It's Ali!

16:22.815 --> 16:25.025
Holy shit. It's her!
Now you can tell her you like her.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.319
Hi! I was just thinking about you.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.405
-Have you seen this shit?
-What?

16:29.488 --> 16:31.490
We had "an erotic dalliance"?

16:31.573 --> 16:32.992
"Sluts of Instagram"?

16:33.075 --> 16:34.368
What the fuck?

16:34.451 --> 16:37.079
-Oh, shit. Guys, check this out!

16:37.162 --> 16:39.039
Ali and Jessi hooked up in jail!

16:39.123 --> 16:43.168
Oh, yeah, it's so hot when girls do gay.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.211
What the fuck?

16:44.294 --> 16:46.046
-Jessi likes Ali?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.965
-Damn. Sorry, dude.

16:48.048 --> 16:53.470
That sucks… that you're so fucking ugly
you made Jessi gay! JK! JK, bro, JK!

16:53.554 --> 16:56.765
-That is not fucking funny!
-Uh, it's funny.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.225
Hey! You're an old man,

16:58.308 --> 17:00.144
-and nobody talks about it.

17:00.227 --> 17:03.063
Old man's about to whup your ass,
young blood!

17:03.147 --> 17:06.525
-I'm gonna fucking kill you!

17:07.901 --> 17:09.528
Jay, you're weeping.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.030
Oh, hey, Andrew.

17:11.113 --> 17:14.742
Don't mind me, I just want
to throw myself into a meat grinder

17:14.825 --> 17:16.285
and get turned into a nugget.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.288
Oh, it seems to me
like you need a soul cleansing.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.206
How about a nice sound bath?

17:21.290 --> 17:22.583
Nong…

17:22.666 --> 17:26.211
-Jay, gong sound, gong…
-No! Wait! What? No! Stop it!

17:26.295 --> 17:27.504
I hate baths!

17:27.588 --> 17:30.090
Hey, Andrew,
I think this jacked little walnut

17:30.174 --> 17:32.551
might just want somebody to listen to him.

17:32.634 --> 17:36.472
Oh, yeah. Right. Okay.
Sorry, Jay. What's making you weep?

17:36.555 --> 17:41.018
Okay, well, um, I've been secretly
sucking face with Charles Lu.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.562
Whoa! Charles is gay? And what about Gina?

17:43.645 --> 17:45.647
-Isn't Charles way out of your league?
-What?

17:45.731 --> 17:48.817
Hey, Andy. Shh.
Try listening without judgment.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.279
Remember, you're the dude
who pulled Lars out of a wheelchair.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.989
How do you know that, Simon Sex?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.992
Oh, Maury tells me everything,
and I listen.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.161
Because you're a good friend
with great hair.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.330
You look like a groovy panther.

18:01.413 --> 18:05.042
Yeah! And you look like
a bunch of penises.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.128
Yeah, I think the mushrooms
are starting to kick in.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.588
And they're gone.

18:09.671 --> 18:12.758
Jay, I'm ready to listen.
Tell me more about Charles Lu.

18:12.841 --> 18:16.470
Well, it's super hot when he uses
his tongue to fuck my mouth,

18:16.553 --> 18:19.306
but he won't use it to fuck my mind.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.225
Okay, so what I'm hearing is

18:21.308 --> 18:24.728
you want someone you can talk to
and who cares about you?

18:24.812 --> 18:28.857
Aw! When you put it that way,
I sound fucking lame!

18:28.941 --> 18:30.192
Please don't tell anyone!

18:30.275 --> 18:34.488
No, no, no. Boys need connection too.
That's what I've been saying all night.

18:34.571 --> 18:37.574
Yeah, I know. You've been really annoying.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.910
I miss Lola.

18:39.993 --> 18:42.955
She's such a special person. Please agree.

18:43.038 --> 18:43.872
No, I can't.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.918
The point is, it's okay if you want more
than what you're getting from Charles.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.878
-It is?
-Of course.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.631
Wow, you're a really good listener,
Andrew.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.217
-I don't even wanna strangle you anymore.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.512
Dude, I said, "JK."
Why are you freaking out?

18:58.595 --> 19:00.264
'Cause you're a fucking asshole!

19:00.347 --> 19:01.932
Finish him!

19:02.015 --> 19:03.016
Ow!

19:03.100 --> 19:04.810
My irregular foot!

19:04.893 --> 19:09.898
-Oh, my God, Lump, are you okay?
-I-I-I'm fine. For men, pain is knowledge.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.610
Oh, my nose won't stop bleeding.
I--I think you broke it!

19:13.694 --> 19:15.779
Oh, buddy. I'm here for you.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.698
What, to fucking cum with me?

19:17.781 --> 19:21.410
I don't want to have a "group drain"
with you, or any of you assholes.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.327
I'm out of here.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.746
He doesn't want to talk
about his feelings!

19:24.830 --> 19:27.749
-Because from now on, he only has one:

19:27.833 --> 19:31.795
white-hot, tiny-fisted fury!

19:31.879 --> 19:34.381
Ooh! My thingy fell off.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.258
Fuck you, thingy.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.886
People online
are going crazy over your rumor.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.847
Wow,
Jessi equals other woman.

19:41.930 --> 19:45.309
So sad to see that I am
the only true feminist at school.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.811
Please show pictures of jail gay.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.813
Fire emoji,
fire emoji, fire emoji.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.399
Oh, my God!

19:52.482 --> 19:55.527
Okay,
these comments are giving me life.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.070
Sorry I'm late, darling.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.031
There was a sale at Victoria's Secret.

19:59.114 --> 20:02.284
I was running low on thongs that
disintegrate the moment I get my period.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.785
That place is trash.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.162
Angels wearing underwear?

20:05.245 --> 20:07.331
I'm not wearing a fucking bra
in the afterlife.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.167
-Oh! Cute hate worm.
-Aw, thank you!

20:10.250 --> 20:11.960
Wait, wait, wait. What kind of worm?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.670
A hate worm. You knew that.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.214
No, I did not!

20:15.297 --> 20:18.217
I'm not the kind of person
who hates people!

20:18.300 --> 20:20.219
Well, not people. Jessi.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.511
But hate is so ugly!

20:21.595 --> 20:22.429
No, it's not!

20:22.512 --> 20:26.725
Martin Luther King hated discrimination,
and he changed the fabric of our country.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.936
Do you think
Martin Luther King was stupid?

20:29.019 --> 20:30.103
Obviously not!

20:30.187 --> 20:31.438
He was a doctor!

20:31.521 --> 20:35.067
Hate could be good. It protects you
from bad things and people that hurt you.

20:35.150 --> 20:37.486
Well, Jessi did hurt me.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.739
And you want to hurt her too, right?
I mean, that's why we made up the rumor.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.450
Wow. I guess I do hate Jessi.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.369
Come on. Say it like you mean it.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.454
You know she deserves your hate.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.790
Hey, hey! You're nothing!

20:49.873 --> 20:52.042
I hate you, Jessi Glazer!

20:52.125 --> 20:56.797
I hate your face and your fucking attitude
and your awful last name.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.466
I wish ill upon you!

20:59.549 --> 21:01.677
That's right! Now, finish her!

21:02.844 --> 21:05.847
Oh, my God! I didn't think
that that was gonna happen.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.975
-Ugh!

21:08.058 --> 21:09.559
I can't believe this.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.728
I know! It's fucked!

21:11.812 --> 21:13.939
People are gonna think
I cheated on Samira.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.358
Samira's gonna think I cheated on Samira.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.735
Oh, God, I didn't think about that.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.445
That's 'cause you're busy thinking about

21:20.529 --> 21:23.115
mashing your boobies
up against her boobies

21:23.198 --> 21:25.784
until all four become one big tit.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.620
I don't think she wants to form
a super-tit right now.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.163
She seems legit upset.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.249
But you're still gonna tell her
you like her, right?

21:32.332 --> 21:34.835
What about all that good shit
we saw on the Love Scope?

21:34.918 --> 21:38.005
Well, should we take another look
to see what else can happen?

21:40.090 --> 21:41.425
Hey, I'm in love with you.

21:41.508 --> 21:42.843
Oh, what the fuck?

21:42.926 --> 21:45.012
I know! It surprised me too.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.556
Dude! Are you seriously
trying to get with me right now?

21:47.639 --> 21:49.308
But we're so good together.

21:49.391 --> 21:52.728
Best friends make the best lovers.
Here, let me sing you a song.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.022
Oh, my God! You sound just like Nick!

21:55.105 --> 21:55.939
Don't say that!

21:56.023 --> 21:58.317
I definitely don't want
to be your lover, Jessi.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.610
And now,
I don't even want to be your friend.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.654
-Shit, that's terrible.

22:02.738 --> 22:06.491
Yeah, but it's what could happen, right?
No one says it's definitely gonna happen.

22:06.575 --> 22:10.662
I mean, remember President Rapinoe
and the attentive cunnilingus? Huh?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.414
It's not worth risking it.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.249
I love her too much as a friend.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.793
Oh, well, fuck you. That's beautiful.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.963
Hey, I'm so sorry about that rumor.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.215
Do you want me to tell Samira
it's not true?

22:22.299 --> 22:25.969
Well, Samira said she'd rather get
a yeast infection in her armpit

22:26.053 --> 22:27.971
than ever talk to you again, so…

22:28.055 --> 22:29.806
-Oh.
-But I appreciate the offer.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.767
You're a really good friend. I love you.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.976
I love you too.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.270
I'm really glad I don't have
to go through this alone.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.230
So I guess that's that, huh?

22:37.314 --> 22:40.442
At least for now. I mean,
being a couple could have been amazing,

22:40.525 --> 22:42.361
but this is pretty great too, right?

22:42.444 --> 22:44.154
She's a good friend.

22:44.237 --> 22:47.199
Good friend with a hot little body
and nice lips,

22:47.282 --> 22:48.950
but I won't bring that up ever again.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.995
Except to say let's kiss her on the mouth.
I'm sorry! That's it.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.080
She's got a good butt.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.749
-Uh, hey, guys, check it out.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.584
Now, I'm Limp Himpman.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.754
-Limp, please go to the hospital.
-I won't.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.466
Hey, you've got this.

23:04.549 --> 23:05.884
Hey, Charles, can we talk?

23:05.967 --> 23:07.844
I guess, make it quick.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.138
It's about us. It's kind of important.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.432
Okay, uh…

23:12.516 --> 23:14.184
Let me just start by saying

23:14.267 --> 23:18.105
I have zero moral problems
with you cheating on Gina with me.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.523
I love cheating.

23:19.606 --> 23:20.899
It's in my blood.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.902
-Along with quite a lot of lead.
-What?

23:23.985 --> 23:27.239
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
I like hooking up,

23:27.322 --> 23:31.952
but I also need a massive
emotional investment from you.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.078
Uh, no?

23:33.161 --> 23:34.955
Sure. Okay.

23:35.038 --> 23:41.294
Well, then I don't think
I can be your sidepiece anymore.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.004
-Okay.
-Uh, cool, man!

23:43.088 --> 23:45.382
Uh, see you in social studies.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.342
Oh, I'm sorry, Jay.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.554
That did not work out at all,
but you know what?

23:50.637 --> 23:52.264
-I'm proud of you.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.182
Thanks, Andrew. Let's go home.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.767
-Look at that.
-Wow.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.686
Those boys are really connecting.

23:57.769 --> 24:00.564
I don't remember Andrew being so blue.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.358
Hey, Jay, when you get home,
you gonna Smurf off?

24:03.442 --> 24:04.276
Oh, yeah!

24:04.359 --> 24:06.194
I'm gonna Smurf into my little white hat

24:06.278 --> 24:08.155
then huck it out the window
of my mushroom house.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.282
-That is so sweet.
-So beautiful.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.576
-I love mushrooms.
-Yeah, baby.

24:14.244 --> 24:17.080
Why didn't Jessi
just tell me that she liked Ali?

24:17.164 --> 24:19.458
Because she's a heartless wench

24:19.541 --> 24:20.834
and she gets off

24:20.917 --> 24:23.336
-on publicly humiliating you.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.297
I can't believe I ever loved her.

24:25.380 --> 24:29.843
Well, you certainly don't
love her anymore.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.596
Walter, are you okay?

24:32.679 --> 24:34.431
I think he's dead, man!

24:34.514 --> 24:36.349
And his nipples are hard.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.684
That's interesting.

24:37.767 --> 24:38.810
Oh, God!

24:38.894 --> 24:42.355
Wow.
How selfish of Jessi and Ali.

24:42.439 --> 24:45.317
-I hope Samira's doing okay.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.611
Feigned sympathy for the ex-girlfriend.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.738
Diabolical, baby.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.615
Haters gonna hate.

24:51.698 --> 24:54.576
You know what might be fun?
Reply from Dr. PlainTalk.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.578
Love that!

24:56.661 --> 24:59.372
You'd think after having her home wrecked,

24:59.456 --> 25:01.917
-Jessi wouldn't be a home-wrecker.
-Mm-hmm!

25:06.755 --> 25:09.925
Missy, we are gonna have
so much fun together!

25:10.008 --> 25:13.803
Ooh-hoo!
Jouhari! That feels weird!

25:13.887 --> 25:15.222
But I like it.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.389
Yeah, you do!

25:16.473 --> 25:18.391
-How you doin', Connie?

25:18.475 --> 25:19.518
I'll be okay.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.354
I just thought we'd be
knuckle-deep into Ali by now.

25:22.437 --> 25:25.315
I gotta learn not to count my pussies
before they snatch.

25:25.398 --> 25:28.151
I never thought
I'd be trying to snatch pussies.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.320
I always thought
I was more of a dick farmer.

25:30.403 --> 25:33.073
You don't have to figure it all out
right now.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.157
You're still young.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.369
And that's the beauty
of modern agriculture.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.746
You can cultivate pussies and dicks.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.790
That's right, honey. Let's take a look.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.337
The dicks sure are
coming in real nice this year.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.505
Very veiny!

25:48.588 --> 25:51.383
Yeah!
And the pussies are looking plump too!

25:51.466 --> 25:53.134
Ooh, yeah, love that color.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.804
-Mm, I bet they're sweet as sugar.

25:55.887 --> 25:59.641
Come on in, guys!
We're servin' asshole for dinner!

25:59.724 --> 26:01.935
Ooh! It's sloppy asshole night.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.061
Race you there!
