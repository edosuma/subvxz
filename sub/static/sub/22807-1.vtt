09:32.037 --> 09:34.173
Took 20 minutes to get
to the gate though.

09:34.175 --> 09:36.375
What's with that bottleneck
you got out there?

09:36.377 --> 09:40.812
I'm sorry our local airport tarmac's
not up to your standards, huh?

09:40.814 --> 09:43.682
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you designed this airport,

09:43.684 --> 09:45.116
or I'd have been
more sensitive.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.251
Oh, I guess I'll move to a new
town with a better airport

09:47.253 --> 09:50.655
that way you won't be inconvenienced
when you show up every five years or so.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.958
(CHUCKLES) Same old
Mr. Touchy. I love it.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.425
Here you go, Pancho.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.094
Why don't you bring the car around,
we'll meet you at the curb.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.127
Right away, sir.

09:57.129 --> 10:00.366
I mean, no, I'm sorry,
I'm not the driver.

10:00.368 --> 10:01.567
No, I'm Brad.

10:01.569 --> 10:02.867
The stepdad.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.903
- This is Sara's husband.
- Why is he with you?

10:04.905 --> 10:07.338
(GASPS) Dad!

10:07.340 --> 10:08.942
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

10:10.543 --> 10:13.713
That sweater. He wears a red sweater,
so I can see him in a crowd.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.183
Dad!

10:18.185 --> 10:19.921
That's him, that's Dad.

10:24.525 --> 10:25.857
(GRUNTS)

10:25.859 --> 10:27.695
Dad. Dad.

10:30.431 --> 10:31.831
(LAUGHING)

10:37.437 --> 10:39.839
- I made a sign.
- There's my big man.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.674
(BOTH LAUGHING)

10:43.676 --> 10:45.709
And this guy's raising
your kids half the time?

10:45.711 --> 10:48.045
He hasn't seen his dad
in a really long time.

10:48.047 --> 10:51.182
It's only been since Thanksgiving,
but it feels like forever.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.717
- It does!
- BOTH: Oh!

10:53.719 --> 10:56.121
Four weeks? It's been
a few years for us.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.890
What should we do? You want
me to take my pants off?

10:58.892 --> 11:00.259
BRAD: Hey, where's Mom?

11:00.261 --> 11:01.794
You didn't get her text?

11:01.796 --> 11:04.730
Uncle Arny came down with
a bad case of the shingles.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.964
- No.
- So Mom's staying back

11:06.966 --> 11:08.500
- to take care of him.
- Okay.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.534
But, hey, you still got me.

11:10.536 --> 11:12.570
I sure do. I sure do!

11:12.572 --> 11:13.773
BOTH: Oh!

11:15.008 --> 11:16.676
BRAD: We're gonna
have the best time.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.776
(GASPS) Oh! Dusty!

11:18.778 --> 11:21.011
- Hey, Don.
- Hey, Muscles, come here.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.850
(STAMMERS) I've got a cold.
Stay away. Don, Don!

11:24.718 --> 11:26.150
Say, Dusty,

11:26.152 --> 11:28.953
Brad told me about this
Together Christmas we're doing.

11:28.955 --> 11:33.158
You two are such wonderful,
progressive co-dads.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.358
Co-dads?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.895
I'm so sorry. Mr. Mayron,
this is my father, Don Whitaker.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.863
The pleasure is all mine,
Captain!

11:39.865 --> 11:43.235
You piloted the Space Shuttle
Atlantis in 1992

11:43.237 --> 11:46.505
and commanded the Endeavour
on three missions in 1994!

11:46.507 --> 11:48.175
All right, come on,
we're out this way.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.342
Thanks, Dusty.

11:50.344 --> 11:53.812
Say, Kurt, did you meet any
interesting folks on your flight?

11:53.814 --> 11:56.613
- I met a Scotch and a pillow.
- (LAUGHS)

11:56.615 --> 11:58.817
You know, actually,
I always pick the flights

11:58.819 --> 12:01.053
that have the most connections
so that

12:01.055 --> 12:05.156
I get to chat with as many
new people as possible.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.238
- Oh, so you're a lunatic. Good to know.
- That's me!

12:08.494 --> 12:10.664
(CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING)

12:16.903 --> 12:20.740
(GRUNTS) Looks like one of your neighbors
is getting an oversized parcel.

12:21.275 --> 12:22.908
Hello!

12:22.910 --> 12:25.209
Don Whitaker,
United States Postal Service!

12:25.211 --> 12:29.246
Retired, but never too old to
lend a hand to a fellow carrier.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.549
Brad, I gotta tell you, this baby
sure gives you a smooth ride.

12:32.551 --> 12:33.618
Oh, thank you, Kurt.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.853
Yeah, it is surprisingly
responsive.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.255
Brad, he's not...

12:37.257 --> 12:38.756
So do they take your balls
right there at the dealership,

12:38.758 --> 12:40.291
or do you send them in
with the registration?

12:40.293 --> 12:41.525
How does it work exactly?

12:41.527 --> 12:43.895
No, no, they didn't take my balls.
Just $2,000 down.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.396
This your place, Dusty?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.899
- I pictured it nicer.
- BRAD: Yeah, Dusty's house is nicer.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.233
This is my house.

12:49.235 --> 12:51.202
Just thought you'd like to
step in and see the kids.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.838
Only if it's okay. Look, we don't
want to infringe on your days.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.007
(SCOFFS) Of course, don't be silly.
Come on, guys.

12:56.009 --> 12:59.578
You got to ask another man's
permission to see your own kids?

12:59.580 --> 13:01.248
(SCOFFS) Unbelievable.

13:02.047 --> 13:05.350
We're back! With more daddies!

13:05.352 --> 13:08.285
Hey! Look how big you two got!

13:08.287 --> 13:10.621
Come on. Don't I get a hug?
Come on!

13:10.623 --> 13:11.956
(KURT CHUCKLES)

13:11.958 --> 13:13.625
And who's this barroom brawler?

13:13.627 --> 13:15.025
MEGAN: He's our brother,
Griffy, silly.

13:15.027 --> 13:18.029
Hey, come here, pardner.
Dusty, you never told me.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.832
- Why, he looks just like you.
- Yeah, not my kid.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.668
Oh, no, no, no.
I fathered that one.

13:22.670 --> 13:24.403
Oh. Ah, then how does he
relate to me then?

13:24.405 --> 13:27.771
Well, he is the brother
of your grandkids, Kurt.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.439
- Oh. Here, here.
- Oh. Okay.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.376
Hey, looking good, Buttercup.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.847
Good to see you.

13:33.714 --> 13:36.179
- Look who's here!
- BOTH: Pop-Pop!

13:36.181 --> 13:37.115
(LAUGHS)

13:37.117 --> 13:38.817
- Tell us a Pop-Pop joke!
- DON: Ooh, ooh.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.118
What's a good one?
Why does a duck have feathers?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.153
Why?

13:42.155 --> 13:45.359
- To cover up his butt quack.
- (ALL LAUGHING)

13:46.292 --> 13:48.193
Hey, kids,
I got a good one for you.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.596
- Two dead hookers wash up on the shore...
- Hey, hey!

13:50.598 --> 13:52.563
- Whoa, whoa, shut up.
- No way. No way.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.503
- Sara. How's my girl?
- Hi!

13:56.603 --> 13:58.001
What, Ginny couldn't make it?

13:58.003 --> 13:59.236
Oh, she feels terrible.

13:59.238 --> 14:02.039
But she sent a batch of
her special cookies!

14:02.041 --> 14:04.375
- Is there milk in that kitchen?
- MEGAN: Yay!

14:04.377 --> 14:06.310
DON: I want the first one.

14:06.312 --> 14:08.313
I get the first one!

14:08.315 --> 14:11.916
So he gets to be Pop-Pop
and I'm just Grandpa Kurt?

14:11.918 --> 14:13.885
What? I'm in charge of the
cutesy grandpa names now?

14:13.887 --> 14:16.453
Look, if you want a better name, maybe
try showing up a little more often.

14:16.455 --> 14:19.793
Tell the kids, from now on,
it's El Padre.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.097
No more hooker jokes.

14:24.998 --> 14:28.299
These don't taste like La-La's cookies.
They taste like Chips Ahoys.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.834
DON: No, no. I sat right there
in the kitchen

14:30.836 --> 14:33.038
and watched Grandma
bake them just yesterday.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.271
DYLAN: I like them.

14:34.273 --> 14:37.708
So, this co-dads thing,
is that what you call it?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.477
Yeah, that's what we call it.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.813
So, on his watch,
he disciplines your kids,

14:41.815 --> 14:43.714
gives them advice, tucks
them in, so forth

14:43.716 --> 14:45.150
and that bothers
you not a bit?

14:45.152 --> 14:46.250
Doesn't bother me at all.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.185
And his total lack of
masculinity...

14:48.187 --> 14:52.122
I mean, his weak chin and soft
underbelly influencing your son,

14:52.124 --> 14:53.824
you're good there,
too? Yeah?

14:53.826 --> 14:56.594
You know what? I'm just feeling like
maybe you guys want a little privacy.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.195
Stay right there,
Brad, all right?

14:58.197 --> 14:59.798
He's just trying
to stir the turd.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.499
- (SCOFFS)
- You can scoff all you want.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.334
Everything is rock solid
between me and Brad here.

15:03.336 --> 15:07.371
- In fact, best friends.
- Really? (SNIFFLES)

15:07.373 --> 15:10.040
- Thank you.
- Brad. Stop it. Now.

15:10.042 --> 15:12.043
- I'm good.
- He gets really emotional.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.078
- Brad. Hey. Brother.
- Did you call me "brother"?

15:15.080 --> 15:17.082
B-Dawg.
Chill out, man. Relax.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.352
All right? Cut it out.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.385
- Brad, don't.
- I know.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.020
Stop. All right, look. Hey.
Brad, stop!

15:23.022 --> 15:26.158
Looks like you two guys
have a real solid arrangement.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.293
You're spending Christmas
together and everything.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.594
Speaking of which, whose place
are we doing that at?

15:30.596 --> 15:32.630
We're totally happy to host
if it makes it easier.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.432
Yeah, we could do it at my place.
I got more room.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.534
We can do presents at our place,
dinner at yours.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.669
Nah, all that back and forth,
who needs that?

15:38.671 --> 15:40.005
This place, that place.

15:40.007 --> 15:43.274
Why don't I book us
a great vacation spot

15:43.276 --> 15:45.076
for all of us,
and we can all spend

15:45.078 --> 15:46.611
the holiday week together?

15:46.613 --> 15:47.879
- Yay! Cool!
- Thanks, El Padre.

15:47.881 --> 15:50.213
- (SPEAKS SPANISH)
- DON: I love this idea!

15:50.215 --> 15:52.150
It's something extra Christmasy,

15:52.152 --> 15:55.319
with lots of snow and family
activities for all of us.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.054
Dad, I'm just worried about
finding a place,

15:57.056 --> 15:58.390
you know, this close
to the holiday.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.858
- (BEEPS)
- Booked it! Airbnb. All done.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.361
- Yay, El Padre!
- (KURT LAUGHS)

16:03.363 --> 16:07.600
It's gonna be so fun, since we're
all such great friends, huh?

16:10.003 --> 16:12.236
BRAD: Off to the mountains.
Here we go, Griffy.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.838
- Here we go.
- Big fun trip!

16:14.840 --> 16:16.274
Let me get
that for you, Sara.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.876
- SARA: Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:17.878 --> 16:19.678
You know, Dusty,
I think you and Kurt

16:19.680 --> 16:21.947
spending some time
around me and my dad

16:21.949 --> 16:23.280
might do you both some good.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.749
Hey, don't you see
what he's up to here?

16:24.751 --> 16:27.052
He thinks you and me are harboring
bad feelings for one another

16:27.054 --> 16:30.054
and sticking us together in some cabin is
gonna bring out whatever we're harboring.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.688
But you're not,
are you, Brad?

16:31.690 --> 16:32.957
- I'm not what?
- Harboring!

16:32.959 --> 16:34.291
No, I'm not harboring anything.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.693
Good, 'cause I'm not
harboring anything either.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.961
BRAD: Okay, well, let's use
this as an opportunity

16:36.963 --> 16:37.929
to show him
that we're not harboring.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.197
'Cause we're not harboring.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.365
You're looking at
one safe harbor right here.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.900
All right, good.

16:41.902 --> 16:43.534
You sure you want to pack it like that?
Is that how you're gonna do it?

16:43.536 --> 16:46.004
Look, me and Brad got everything
under control as a team, okay?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.472
- Right, Brad?
- That's right.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.973
Yeah, what would I know
about travel?

16:48.975 --> 16:50.341
I've only been
to frickin' space.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.043
What, did you pack
the space shuttle yourself?

16:52.045 --> 16:54.212
You pop the trunk, arrange all the bags
for you and your little space friends?

16:54.214 --> 16:56.483
I did, as a matter of fact.
Yes, I packed the shuttle.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.951
That's so cool!

16:59.953 --> 17:01.953
I love how you're always
jotting down ideas

17:01.955 --> 17:04.054
for your book
in your little notepad.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.321
People ever get crazy and think

17:05.324 --> 17:07.193
you might be writing
something bad about them?

17:09.529 --> 17:14.665
Say, Brad, would you mind doing some
"Yes, And" drills with me on the way?

17:14.666 --> 17:17.268
"Yes, And" thank you
for asking me.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.204
I recently joined
an improv comedy workshop.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.137
Brad's been pushing me to do it
for years. (CHUCKLES)

17:22.140 --> 17:23.575
Because you're so funny.

17:23.577 --> 17:25.076
Yeah, I really enjoy it.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.376
You should look into it, too,
Kurt.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.413
I'd rather look into
a loaded gun.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.147
- Did you hear that?
- Did you just make that up?

17:30.149 --> 17:32.148
- Zinger!
- That's provocative, too.

17:32.150 --> 17:33.684
You ready to let me do that,
Mr. Stubborn?

17:33.686 --> 17:35.853
- I got it.
- KURT: It's never gonna fit.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.288
Hey, kids, no, no, no, no,

17:37.290 --> 17:39.957
why don't you jump into my car
with Adrianna, all right?

17:39.959 --> 17:44.395
So Grandpa Kurt here can enjoy Pop-Pop's
company on the way up. (CHUCKLES)

17:44.397 --> 17:47.232
Already warmed up a spot
in the capsule for you, Captain!

17:47.234 --> 17:49.336
Still never gonna fit. Ever.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.739
No, I got it. It's fitting fine.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.609
I just had to put it wheels-in.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.446
Perfect fit!
All right, let's go.

18:03.448 --> 18:05.383
Hey, Adrianna, you know,
when we're up there,

18:05.385 --> 18:06.952
I can teach you
how to snowboard.

You need a hat.
You're gonna freeze, babe.

- You look cute.

27:54.874 --> 27:58.274
Hey, I want to talk to you.
I'm worried about your dad.

27:58.276 --> 28:01.412
Don't you think he seems slightly
less chatty than normal?

28:01.414 --> 28:02.782
You got to be shitting me.

28:03.715 --> 28:05.582
I mean, he shows up here without
your mom?

28:05.584 --> 28:08.085
Don't you think that's weird?
There might be a problem?

28:08.087 --> 28:09.953
With my mom and dad's
relationship?

28:09.955 --> 28:10.855
Yeah!

28:10.857 --> 28:13.359
What? They love each other
more than we do!

28:13.959 --> 28:14.857
Yeah.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.559
I brought you your hat!

28:16.561 --> 28:18.529
No, honey,
I didn't mean it that way.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.597
It's a huge compliment. Come on.

28:20.599 --> 28:21.764
You got to understand.

any idea how much

can impact the gas bill?

Brad, do you let the kids touch
the thermostat at your house?

What? No! The thermostat
is a sacred covenant.

we're even talking about this!

of rejection.

put yourself out there.

You walk right up to her,
you dangle this over her head,

36:25.151 --> 36:27.551
and then you slap your spaghetti
suckers right on her.

36:27.553 --> 36:28.984
I don't know if that's
appropriate.

It's a time-honored holiday
tradition, Mr. War-On-Christmas.

36:32.256 --> 36:34.191
Then you give her a nice smack
on the caboose

36:34.193 --> 36:35.825
and tell her what a lucky girl
she is.

36:35.827 --> 36:37.894

- Yeah, don't listen to that part.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.296

37:24.276 --> 37:26.042
We're gonna cut off
the top 25 feet

37:26.044 --> 37:28.144
and chop the rest up for
firewood, Don.

37:28.146 --> 37:29.312
Oh.

37:29.314 --> 37:31.281
Now, this is the Duster Buster
I remember.

37:31.283 --> 37:35.218
A certified badass
that makes his own rules!

37:35.220 --> 37:37.423
Go find a good tree, would you?

37:38.356 --> 37:40.756
Boy, I don't know about this,
Kurt.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.493
Isn't it illegal to harvest
a tree from public lands?

37:43.495 --> 37:45.595
Oh, hell, yeah.
It's a federal crime.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.798
I tried to talk him out of it, but you
know how stubborn that kid can be.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.466
Okay.

37:50.468 --> 37:53.803
Dusty, look, I know you're upset
about Dylan, but I just...

37:53.805 --> 37:56.939
I told you, Brad, I'm not upset,
all right? We're co-dads!

37:56.941 --> 37:59.743
If he prefers your terrible
advice, fine, I'm cool with that.

37:59.745 --> 38:02.011
I just want to find the perfect
Together Christmas tree.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.914
Well, I just don't know if
it's the best choice, you know?

38:03.916 --> 38:07.883
Well, maybe we're not always gonna
do everything your way every time.

38:07.885 --> 38:09.086
Trouble in paradise, fellas?

38:09.088 --> 38:11.624
- No, we're picking a tree.
- Just having a conversation.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.359
MEGAN AND DYLAN: El Padre!

38:14.693 --> 38:15.758
Lookit!

38:15.760 --> 38:18.394
Hey, what, kids?
What, you find a dead squirrel?

38:18.396 --> 38:20.097
We don't have to
do things my way.

38:20.099 --> 38:21.164
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.765
What about baseball snack?

38:22.767 --> 38:24.501
I just wanted to give out Fruit
Roll-Ups, and what's the big deal?

38:24.503 --> 38:27.104
No, I just feel like organic
fruit is much more nutritious

38:27.106 --> 38:28.439
than its rolled-up counterpart.

38:28.441 --> 38:30.140
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:30.142 --> 38:32.142
And what about Megan's diorama? You
didn't want to use any of my ideas.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.542
Your only idea was
the Bay of Pigs!

38:33.544 --> 38:35.278
But it's an important event
in our nation's history!

38:35.280 --> 38:36.914
It was bloody.

38:36.916 --> 38:39.048
You wanted her to do green energy
so you could look Mr. Perfect Dad.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.517
- I'm not Mr. Perfect Dad.
- You act like Mr. Perfect Dad.

38:41.519 --> 38:42.718
I'm not Mr. Perfect Dad.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.153
And we don't have to do things
my way.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.858
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

38:47.459 --> 38:49.959
Okay. You don't think I can
operate a chainsaw, do you?

38:49.961 --> 38:53.796
Guess who got his woodlands
management badge in Webelos.

38:53.798 --> 38:56.332
I did! Brad Whitaker.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.633
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:57.635 --> 38:58.935
Ah!

38:58.937 --> 39:02.875
Dusty, look at this one.
Perfectly symmetrical.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.510
Okay.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.111
Oh, yeah.

39:09.113 --> 39:10.981
Keep an eye out for rangers!

39:10.983 --> 39:15.218
I've got to pinpoint
a 60 degree angle top cut.

39:15.220 --> 39:17.723
That's what I'm gonna do first.

39:19.124 --> 39:21.026
Oh, yeah!
She's cutting like butter!

39:22.327 --> 39:24.430
Hey, Brad, isn't that a...

39:28.200 --> 39:30.368
- (TREE CRACKING)
- (CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

39:34.138 --> 39:35.374
Hold it, hold it!

39:36.274 --> 39:37.910
MEGAN: Timber!

39:39.879 --> 39:42.379
(LAUGHS) Wow!

39:42.381 --> 39:44.781
Brad, you cut down
a cell phone tower.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.783
Why'd you cut down
a cell phone tower?

39:46.785 --> 39:48.885
- (PHONE BEEPS)
- No bars? No bars?

39:48.887 --> 39:50.488
(SCREAMS)

39:51.589 --> 39:53.089
- KURT: That was excellent!
- Get up.

39:53.091 --> 39:55.223
- You really stuck that landing, man.
- Would you get up?

39:55.225 --> 39:56.993
I'd give you a 9.2 on my card.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.462
- Brad, get up.
- I think Brad's dead again.

39:59.464 --> 40:01.564
Man, you killed
the poor bastard!

40:01.566 --> 40:02.999
Brad, don't go into the light!

40:03.001 --> 40:05.568
It's okay, sweetheart.
El Padre will bring him back.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.236
- Stand clear.
- I got it, all right?

40:07.238 --> 40:08.837
It's your fault
we're even out here.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.941
You're getting in our heads and
starting static between me and Brad.

40:10.943 --> 40:13.609
(SCOFFS) There's plenty of static
between you and Brad already.

40:13.611 --> 40:16.379
And you know what? Deep down,
you want him dead, don't you?

40:16.381 --> 40:17.714
You can say it.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.783
We all want him dead. I want him dead.
Everybody does.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.251
- What?
- Come on, admit it.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.752
Why don't you admit why you
invited yourself to Christmas?

40:23.754 --> 40:25.287
Well, why don't you tell me,
smart guy?

40:25.289 --> 40:26.823
'Cause you knew I was back here
trying to be a good dad,

40:26.825 --> 40:28.957
be around for my kids
the way you never were for me.

40:28.959 --> 40:30.961
That's why you want to crap all
over it.

40:30.963 --> 40:32.365
- Get up, Brad!
- (GASPS)

40:33.698 --> 40:35.231
Oh, my God, what happened?

40:35.233 --> 40:37.066
You cut down
a cell phone tower, Brad.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.502
You know, you're right.

40:38.504 --> 40:40.005
I did invite myself
to Christmas.

40:41.138 --> 40:42.575
But that's because you never do.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.341
(BRAD GROANS)

40:45.343 --> 40:47.510
I feel like I died again.
Did I die again?

40:47.512 --> 40:48.948
A little bit. Come on.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.551
Okay. Our report's
all squared away.

40:54.553 --> 40:56.285
Yimmy, Bill,
thank you guys so much

40:56.287 --> 40:57.787
for the understanding.
We really appreciate it.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.256
BRAD: I'm so sorry.
I'm truly embarrassed.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.392
BILL: No, hey.
It was an honest mistake.

41:02.394 --> 41:03.892
YIMMY: Okay, you're all set.

41:03.894 --> 41:06.597
BILL: Okay, We'd better get back
to the site and lock it down.

41:06.599 --> 41:09.399
Hold on one second.

41:09.401 --> 41:12.435
Is there any way
we could do better than $20,000?

41:12.437 --> 41:15.004
Can't you reuse some
of the antenna equipment?

41:15.006 --> 41:18.607
Sorry, no. These old 4G units
are obsolete already.

41:18.609 --> 41:20.577
That's why you're getting
this one so cheap!

41:20.579 --> 41:22.479
- It looks really nice, though.
- It sure does.

41:22.481 --> 41:25.214
Hey, guys, keep it up, it looks
great. Happy Holidays.

41:25.216 --> 41:26.749
Happy Christmas, guys. Thanks.

41:26.751 --> 41:30.086
Please tell me you did not just
spend $20,000 on a Christmas tree?

41:30.088 --> 41:32.825
Twenty thousand dollars.
"Can you hear me now?"

41:33.959 --> 41:35.194
You want some eggnog?

41:38.196 --> 41:40.162
- Mmm. Yummy.
- Hey!

41:40.164 --> 41:41.698
- I want some!
- Me, too!

41:41.700 --> 41:43.499
Now, girls,
that's a grown-up drink.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.468
Yes. Thank you, Karen.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.236
So we're only gonna have one.

41:47.238 --> 41:48.504
SARA: What? No, no, no!

41:48.506 --> 41:50.509
There's rum in there,
so not any.

41:50.876 --> 41:51.877
BOTH: Aw!

41:53.512 --> 41:55.345
Are you writing about me?

41:55.347 --> 41:56.847
All right. Somebody want
to plug her in?

41:56.849 --> 41:58.050
Yeah, I got it.

41:59.950 --> 42:01.086
DYLAN: Cool!

42:02.187 --> 42:03.756
That's weird.

42:06.457 --> 42:07.660
DYLAN: Wow!

42:23.374 --> 42:24.676
What do you think?

42:26.010 --> 42:27.343
It's so pretty.

42:27.345 --> 42:29.879
Well, it ought to be
at 1,200 bucks a foot.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.180
Dad, we're lighting the tree!

42:32.182 --> 42:33.216
Where's my dad?

42:33.218 --> 42:35.318
Yeah, I thought it was
a little quiet around here.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.886
- Pop-Pop?
- Don?

42:36.888 --> 42:37.923
Pop-Pop?

42:39.057 --> 42:40.526
Is he still outside?

42:43.528 --> 42:45.563
BRAD: Dad!

42:46.330 --> 42:47.800
Dad?

42:48.834 --> 42:49.902
Dad?

42:50.468 --> 42:52.102
DON: Brad!

42:52.104 --> 42:53.870
Dad! Where are you?

42:53.872 --> 42:56.339
- I found him! Where are you?
- DON: I don't know.

42:56.341 --> 42:58.240
- Are you hurt?
- DON: Oh, no, no!

42:58.242 --> 43:01.144
No, I just can't quite get up.

43:01.146 --> 43:02.577
(PANTING) Oh!

43:02.579 --> 43:04.214
Dad, don't move.

43:04.216 --> 43:06.048
There's a pack of wolves on you.

43:06.050 --> 43:07.950
- DON: Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

43:07.952 --> 43:10.218
I can feel something
tugging at my trousers.

43:10.220 --> 43:12.990
- What color are they, Brad?
- They're gray wolves.

43:12.992 --> 43:15.191
DON: That'll be <i>Canis lupus.</i>
They're dangerous.

43:15.193 --> 43:17.760
BRAD: Really? They look like you
could just reach out and pet them.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.162
I kind of want to pet them, Dad.

43:19.164 --> 43:21.932
Now, Brad. Don't make eye
contact with the alpha wolf.

43:21.934 --> 43:24.399
I already did!
Right in the eyes.

43:24.401 --> 43:25.901
DON: Don't show any fear.

43:25.903 --> 43:28.004
I don't want to watch the wolves
eat you!

43:28.006 --> 43:30.207
DON: Breathe deep
and pull yourself together.

43:30.209 --> 43:31.741
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43:31.743 --> 43:32.745
Hut!

43:34.946 --> 43:36.745
Hut! Hurt!

43:36.747 --> 43:38.515
Are you saying "hut" or "hurt"?

43:38.517 --> 43:40.015
Dad, what happened?

43:40.017 --> 43:43.319
You know, I saw the nicest tree
a ways off,

43:43.321 --> 43:45.421
and I got a little off course.

43:45.423 --> 43:48.524
I tried to call you, but all of
a sudden my signal dropped!

43:48.526 --> 43:49.591
Really?

43:49.593 --> 43:50.827
I tried to find my way back,

43:50.829 --> 43:53.796
but at some point I lost
consciousness.

43:53.798 --> 43:57.267
That's about when the wolves
must have come across me.

43:57.269 --> 43:58.501
It's all right, fellas.

43:58.503 --> 44:00.638
You didn't have to go to any
trouble. It's all good.

44:06.510 --> 44:09.544
I'm sorry for all the hugs.

44:09.546 --> 44:11.013
I kind of don't want to let go.

44:11.015 --> 44:14.216
I almost thought I'd lost you
out there to those nasty wolves.

44:14.218 --> 44:16.185
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

44:16.187 --> 44:19.756
Well, of course I do.
You tweet about it every day.

44:19.758 --> 44:22.426
You know how much I love you,
too, don't you?

44:22.428 --> 44:25.030
- Your answer is right in here.
- (GASPS)

44:25.698 --> 44:27.229
I can see it!

44:27.231 --> 44:28.464
(SCOFFS)

44:28.466 --> 44:30.801
Okay, now that everyone is
accounted for,

44:30.803 --> 44:34.537
can we please talk about who is
paying for that monstrosity?

44:34.539 --> 44:37.406
Well, you know, it was Dusty's
idea to cut down the tree.

44:37.408 --> 44:40.075
Yeah, and it was your idea to cut
down the cell phone tower, Brad.

44:40.077 --> 44:42.410
Great, so as per usual
we get stuck paying.

44:42.412 --> 44:44.781
- Wait, what does that mean?
- I think it's a nice tree.

44:44.783 --> 44:46.749
I don't know. Dylan's retainer?
Megan's flute?

44:46.751 --> 44:48.785
What about Tae Kwon Do
that you signed them up for

44:48.787 --> 44:50.118
and didn't even ask us about?

44:50.120 --> 44:52.689
Yes, and who paid for the trip
to the aquarium last week?

44:52.691 --> 44:53.923
It's a really nice tree.

44:53.925 --> 44:55.658
So now we're keeping score, huh?

44:55.660 --> 44:57.727
Well, who paid for the parking and
bought each one of them a blowup orca?

44:57.729 --> 44:59.863
After we told them they
couldn't have a blowup orca!

44:59.865 --> 45:02.064
Yeah, because you were too cheap
to buy them a blowup orca!

45:02.066 --> 45:04.466
Who crushed my car with a snow
blower? You did, Brad.

45:04.468 --> 45:05.767
Who crushed my car
with a motorcycle?

45:05.769 --> 45:07.102
Hello! You again!

45:07.104 --> 45:07.970
DON: Hey!

45:07.972 --> 45:09.437
It's a beautiful tree!

45:09.439 --> 45:11.941
It's beautiful, all right?

45:11.943 --> 45:14.213
BRAD: Okay, yeah. Dad's right.

45:15.213 --> 45:16.814
It's a beautiful tree.

45:18.582 --> 45:20.450
KURT: Whoa!

45:20.452 --> 45:23.419
Don, I'm sorry, I don't think I'm
gonna be able to save the foot.

45:23.421 --> 45:24.620
Yeah, that baby's coming off.

45:24.622 --> 45:26.522
I'll need some morphine
and a bread knife.

45:26.524 --> 45:27.890
Brad, hold him down.

45:27.892 --> 45:30.026
(LAUGHS) Oh, no.
That's just my feet.

45:30.028 --> 45:32.093
It's the mail carrier's curse.

45:32.095 --> 45:34.430
Back when I used to
sleep with your mom,

45:34.432 --> 45:38.935
I once scratched her leg so bad
with a piece of rogue heel skin,

45:38.937 --> 45:40.604
it actually drew blood.

45:40.606 --> 45:43.008
What do you mean,
used to sleep with Ginny?

45:43.307 --> 45:45.006
What?

45:45.008 --> 45:48.077
Oh. We sleep
in separate bedrooms.

45:48.079 --> 45:51.214
You know how badly I snore,
Brad.

45:51.216 --> 45:53.182
Boy, that is inspiring!

45:53.184 --> 45:57.255
You know? The way you're always so
considerate to the other person.

45:57.990 --> 45:59.655
KURT: Ugh.

45:59.657 --> 46:01.859
I really want to take
this foot off.

46:02.361 --> 46:03.362
(SNORING)

46:11.169 --> 46:12.368
DUSTY: Hey, sweetie.

46:12.370 --> 46:13.903
You know, you might want to
close your window.

46:13.905 --> 46:15.372
You know, since it's winter?

46:15.374 --> 46:16.740
You're not my dad.

46:16.742 --> 46:19.075
You know, I appreciate you reminding
me of that every few hours.

46:19.077 --> 46:20.376
But, you know,
we're not the only people here,

46:20.378 --> 46:23.212
so maybe we set the thermostat
to like 75?

I mean, that's still really
toasty, right?

46:25.417 --> 46:26.448

46:26.450 --> 46:29.651
Okay, well, what if I counter
you at like 78?

46:29.653 --> 46:32.187
And then you negotiate with me,
you come back at like 83,

46:32.189 --> 46:33.856
and then maybe we settle
at like 80.

46:33.858 --> 46:35.557
- What do you say to that?
- 81.

46:35.559 --> 46:37.026
Deal!

46:37.028 --> 46:39.428
Look at that. The two of us
are starting to see eye to eye.

Thank you, sweetie.

cocoa for being such a jerk.

Thank you.

- Why would you do that?
- Look what you made me do!

46:52.644 --> 46:54.077
- I didn't do anything.
- I didn't make you do it!

46:54.079 --> 46:55.377
I thought you were bringing me
hot makeup cocoa

46:55.379 --> 46:56.845
and you just, like,
threw it all over yourself.

46:56.847 --> 46:58.147
You almost burned me, Brad!

46:58.149 --> 47:00.383
- I wasn't bringing you makeup cocoa.
- Why not?

47:00.385 --> 47:02.118
I would've said, "Here, bud,
here's some makeup cocoa."

47:02.120 --> 47:04.287
- I've been waiting for my makeup cocoa.
- I didn't know that!

47:04.289 --> 47:06.859
If I knew you wanted makeup
cocoa, I would've...

I talked her down
from the high 80s.

47:10.428 --> 47:12.194
I'm making progress with her.
This is good.

47:12.196 --> 47:13.629
I thought you had
your house in order.

47:13.631 --> 47:14.865
Look, don't you see?

47:14.867 --> 47:16.265
We're doing exactly
what he wants.

47:16.267 --> 47:17.566
We're letting things
out of the harbor!

47:17.568 --> 47:18.868
- So you are harboring.
- Of course I'm harboring!

47:18.870 --> 47:20.202
And so are you.

47:20.204 --> 47:22.305
Harboring was working just fine
before he showed up.

47:22.307 --> 47:23.906
Let's get everything
back in the harbor

47:23.908 --> 47:26.475
and let's harbor it all back
in and close up the harbor.

47:26.477 --> 47:27.644
I don't know if I can!

47:27.646 --> 47:29.511
Remember you said let's put the
focus back on the kids?

47:29.513 --> 47:31.182
That was a great idea!

47:32.115 --> 47:35.383
- Fine. Harbor's closed.
- Good.

47:35.385 --> 47:37.453
But we're going halfsies
on the cell tower.

Fine, halfsies
on the cell tower.

Brad, are you okay?

47:42.327 --> 47:43.359
Yeah.

47:43.361 --> 47:45.928
- Did you make tee-tee in bed?
- No, it's cocoa.

47:45.930 --> 47:47.897
Did your cocoa make you tee-tee
in bed?

47:47.899 --> 47:49.464
You're sleepwalking.
Go back to sleep.

Hey. Do you mind?
Bowler's etiquette.

48:19.131 --> 48:21.162
- What do you mean?
- It means you're crowding me.

48:21.164 --> 48:23.067
What? You can't bowl
with me here?

48:26.771 --> 48:28.039

48:44.655 --> 48:45.955
- What? The rails?
- Yeah.

48:45.957 --> 48:47.756
It's how the kids
learn how to bowl, Dad.

48:47.758 --> 48:49.626
You learn by fearing the gutter.

48:49.628 --> 48:51.327
Like in life, Dusty.

48:51.329 --> 48:54.997

with those sissy rails up,

or do you want to stand
and bowl like a man?

I don't need the rails,
I guess.

56:21.579 --> 56:23.511
Megan is a strong
independent woman.

56:23.513 --> 56:25.615
If she wants to help thin
the wild turkey population

56:25.617 --> 56:27.816
so that they don't starve to
death in the winter,

56:27.818 --> 56:29.519
that is her right
by the Second Amendment.

56:29.521 --> 56:31.519
Boy, you bought into
that real quick.

56:31.521 --> 56:33.055
I mean, I think for Megan,

56:33.057 --> 56:35.557
this is less about wildlife
conservation and more about bloodlust.

56:35.559 --> 56:38.593
Looks like somebody picked
the wrong day to be a turkey.

56:38.595 --> 56:41.263
KURT: Keep your elbow down
and cradle the stock, okay.

56:41.265 --> 56:42.330
Yeah, I get it.

56:42.332 --> 56:43.999
Can I shoot the damn thing
or not?

56:44.001 --> 56:45.600
Yeah, that's the spirit.

56:45.602 --> 56:47.202
DUSTY: Take a deep breath,

56:47.204 --> 56:50.675
and then squeeze that trigger
as you're letting it out.

56:51.943 --> 56:53.908
Megan, are you sure
this is what you want to do?

56:53.910 --> 56:55.711
- (SHUSHES)
- DON: Let's name it.

56:55.713 --> 56:57.446
She's not gonna kill it if it
has a name.

56:57.448 --> 57:00.182
- Yes! Gertrude.
- Sam? Tom?

57:00.184 --> 57:01.515
Billie Holiday! No.

57:01.517 --> 57:02.917
- Elijah.
- Elijah!

57:02.919 --> 57:04.854
- DON: Elijah, run home!
- KURT: Stand your ground, kid.

57:04.856 --> 57:05.720
Save yourself, Elijah!

57:05.722 --> 57:07.022
Take the shot, kid.
Take the shot.

57:07.024 --> 57:08.223
BRAD: No, Elijah has feelings!

57:08.225 --> 57:09.491
Take the shot!

57:09.493 --> 57:11.327
- (MEGAN SCREAMS)
- (GUN FIRES)

57:11.329 --> 57:12.597
Oh, God!

57:12.963 --> 57:14.028
Dad!

57:14.030 --> 57:16.332
Oh, my God. Honey, are you okay?

57:16.334 --> 57:17.399
- BRAD: Kurt!
- Dad, Dad, are you all right?

57:17.401 --> 57:18.767
I'm okay. She just winged me.

57:18.769 --> 57:20.336
I'm sorry, El Padre! I'm sorry.

57:20.338 --> 57:22.937
That's okay, kid. I've been shot
worse than this plenty of times.

57:22.939 --> 57:24.707
DUSTY: Make your scarf
into a tourniquet.

57:24.709 --> 57:26.475
Wrap it around his shoulder.

57:26.477 --> 57:27.975
Lift his legs!

57:27.977 --> 57:30.147
- You'll be fine, sweetheart.
- I'm gonna bleed out.

57:37.854 --> 57:39.087
Wow.

57:39.089 --> 57:40.321
Two for two.

57:40.323 --> 57:41.591
Makes getting shot worth it.

57:41.593 --> 57:43.292
Get the birds, Brad.

57:43.294 --> 57:45.493
God! I don't know
who this child is.

57:45.495 --> 57:46.964
You get that one.

57:53.704 --> 57:54.705
(SIGHS)

57:55.439 --> 57:57.406
What? I know, okay?

57:57.408 --> 57:59.542
It's on me.
I'm the worst mom in the world.

57:59.544 --> 58:03.511
I put a gun in my daughter's hand,
and then she nearly killed somebody.

58:03.513 --> 58:05.816
She's gonna be scarred for life.

58:06.350 --> 58:07.482
MEGAN: Hi!

58:07.484 --> 58:09.484
I just shot a turkey and a man.

58:09.486 --> 58:11.189
Guess which one's dead.

58:15.925 --> 58:18.993
Okay, fine, maybe
she's a little too unscarred.

58:18.995 --> 58:20.030
Jeez.

58:24.767 --> 58:26.401
- You all right?
- Yeah, good.

58:26.403 --> 58:29.037
All right. So, listen, the doctor said
everything is gonna be all right.

58:29.039 --> 58:31.040
He just wants to keep you
for a couple of hours

58:31.042 --> 58:32.207
to watch your blood pressure.

58:32.209 --> 58:33.776
I'm fine. Where's my pants?

58:33.778 --> 58:35.711
Hey. I forgot. Nothing ever
hurts you.

58:35.713 --> 58:37.278
Why don't we just round up all
the nurses?

58:37.280 --> 58:38.381
We can bring them in here.

58:38.383 --> 58:39.582
You could do some
pushups for them,

58:39.584 --> 58:40.749
maybe bench press the couch
a little bit,

58:40.751 --> 58:41.984
prove you're still a tough guy.

58:41.986 --> 58:44.319
- Still tough enough to lick you, Junior.
- (SCOFFS)

58:44.321 --> 58:45.586
- Was that a scoff?
- I didn't scoff.

58:45.588 --> 58:46.854
Yeah, I heard you scoff just
then.

58:46.856 --> 58:48.089
All right, I scoffed. So what?

58:48.091 --> 58:49.792
Why, because you think
you can lick me, right?

58:49.794 --> 58:51.593
I never said I could lick you,
but I could whoop you for sure.

58:51.595 --> 58:52.761
Now we're talking!

58:52.763 --> 58:54.196
Come on. Best out of three
falls, come on.

58:54.198 --> 58:55.763
Hey, cut it out, okay? I'm not
gonna wrestle an old man

58:55.765 --> 58:57.600
whose ass is hanging out
of his hospital gown.

58:57.602 --> 58:58.934
Greco-Roman style. Best way.
Come on.

58:58.936 --> 59:01.269
Hey, Great Santini, I'm not
gonna do this, all right?

59:01.271 --> 59:03.039
- Cut it out. Get some rest.
- All right.

59:03.041 --> 59:04.640
Hey!

59:04.642 --> 59:06.674
That's one, candy-ass.

59:06.676 --> 59:08.444
Now you're gonna get whipped,
old man.

59:08.446 --> 59:09.714
Come on. Bring it on.

59:11.249 --> 59:12.250
(THUDDING)

59:14.684 --> 59:17.285
- Tap out!
- Nah. I can keep going all night, kid.

59:17.287 --> 59:19.622
You hear that heart rate?
You can set your watch to it.

59:19.624 --> 59:21.524
Yeah. 'Cause ice water
only flows at one speed, huh?

59:21.526 --> 59:23.292
That's right, pal.
Now go to sleep.

59:23.294 --> 59:25.974
You know I came in to say something
nice, but now you can forget it.

59:26.564 --> 59:27.897
What nice thing?

59:27.899 --> 59:29.031
No. Forget it.

59:29.033 --> 59:31.332
You know,
when that gun went off,

59:31.334 --> 59:32.501
I thought you were a goner.

59:32.503 --> 59:33.702
There's something that we never
say that

59:33.704 --> 59:35.344
one of us should say before it's
too late.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.040
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)

59:38.042 --> 59:39.508
Yeah? Like... Like what?

59:39.510 --> 59:42.044
No, I'm not gonna say it now, but
maybe you want to say something.

59:42.046 --> 59:44.145
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, yeah?

59:44.147 --> 59:46.714
Seems like you might want to
get something off your chest.

59:46.716 --> 59:47.783
No. Nothing comes to mind.

59:47.785 --> 59:49.017
But if you want to say
something,

59:49.019 --> 59:50.486
I'm not gonna stop you or
anything.

59:50.488 --> 59:51.553
No, I'm good.

59:51.555 --> 59:52.720
But you might wanna
unburden yourself

59:52.722 --> 59:54.089
before you bust
that frickin' machine.

59:54.091 --> 59:57.559
Yeah. Well, if I was gonna say
something, and I'm not...

59:57.561 --> 59:58.761
What are you gonna say?

59:58.763 --> 01:00:00.328
But if I was, I might want to
tell you that I...

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.830
- BRAD: Hello?
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:00:01.832 --> 01:00:02.631
Wait, it's Brad! Don't...
Don't say it! Don't say it.

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:03.765
BRAD: Knock, knock!

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.033
Time out on three, okay?
One, two, three.

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:06.037
Hey, Brad.

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:07.836
What's going on?

01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:09.638
Hey. Am I interrupting
something?

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.307
- What? No, nothing.
- No, we're fine.

01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:12.506
Why are you being so weird,
Brad?

01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:14.142
BRAD: Just seems
a little awkward in here.

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:15.377
(SNIFFS)

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:17.211
Oh, gosh.
It smells like a bullfight.

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:18.814
So, look, guys,

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:20.982
I'm not here to tell you I told
you so,

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:22.019
even though I did.

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:24.319
I've just been thinking that

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:26.687
we've had a lot of tensions
as of late, and I thought

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:29.124
maybe we could use
a Dads' Night Out. Right?

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.660
Yeah. So what are we thinking,
Brad?

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:33.160
Strip club?

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:35.531
Even better.

01:00:35.533 --> 01:00:39.334
Look, it's a cute tiny monkey
on your back.

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:40.338
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:46.143
Give us all the money in the
drawers and all the lollipops.

(LAUGHING MOCKINGLY)

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.849
Guys, I can't keep up.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:02.557
I'm gonna hit the head.

01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:04.359
- I'll get us a couple more drinks.
- KURT: Sure.

01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:06.961
Hey, am I crazy or are you guys
having a good time?

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:08.564
I don't know.
I think we kind of are.

01:01:08.566 --> 01:01:11.533
- That's wonderful, Dusty!
- Thanks, Don.

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:13.468
I told you we'd rub off
on you two.

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.236
In this room right now,

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:18.506
there's a man who,
despite his advancing years,

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.845
is apparently an improv ninja.

01:01:21.446 --> 01:01:23.011
Brad, you didn't.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.781
I did. I so did!

01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:28.182
Don Whitaker, ladies and
gentlemen!

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.651
All right. All right.

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:32.189
(PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC)

01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:34.658
You are the greatest.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:39.261
ACTRESS: Don!
Let's hear it for Don!

01:01:39.263 --> 01:01:40.828
We're gonna play
a little "Arms Akimbo."

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:41.997
Do you know that one?

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:43.332
- Of course I do!
- Awesome.

01:01:43.334 --> 01:01:44.665
They're gonna love this.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:47.602
- Can somebody do my Velcro?
- Yes.

01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:49.604
He's got tiny little girl arms!

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:51.138
(CROWD LAUGHING)

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.809
DON: Okay. We're gonna do a scene,
and we need some suggestions.

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:56.511
Can you suggest an animal?

01:01:56.513 --> 01:01:57.912
- MAN: Raccoon!
- BRAD: A panda!

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.781
DON: Raccoon, good! All right.

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:01.783
And, sir, what is your
profession?

01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:03.184
MAN: I'm a dermatologist.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:06.388
DON: And finally we need
a human relationship.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.522
Oh! Father and son!

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:09.357
A healthy father and son
relationship.

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:10.961
Or how about a divorce?

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:14.129
Now you're getting in the
spirit, Dusty.

01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:15.464
Yes. Okay. We're taking
"divorce."

01:02:15.466 --> 01:02:16.731
That's all we need. Give it up!

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.436
That's really dark.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:20.135
KYLE: Oh, come on, babe.

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:21.903
Just a little fun before
he gets here.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.138
No. Stop it. I told you, okay?

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.841
No canoodling until
the divorce is finalized.

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:27.712
- It's not right.
- Come on.

01:02:28.146 --> 01:02:29.245
Knock, knock.

01:02:29.247 --> 01:02:32.316
He has no idea what
he's walking into!

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:35.116
You're home!

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:36.254
Yes.

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:38.423
Where were you?

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:43.057
I took our raccoon to the
dermatologist.

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.626
He got two
of the suggestions already.

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:46.127
He's on fire!

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:48.397
Aren't you even gonna address
the strange man in your home?

01:02:48.399 --> 01:02:51.667
Yeah, bro, don't you even
want to know who I am?

01:02:51.669 --> 01:02:53.401
I know who you are.

01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:55.136
KYLE: Don, if you'll excuse me,

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:57.140
I think I'm gonna start
giving it to your wife.

01:02:57.541 --> 01:02:58.673
Shut up!

01:02:58.675 --> 01:03:01.410
Just shut up with
that kind of talk!

01:03:01.412 --> 01:03:04.412
When we met on that flight,
I was really nice to you.

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:08.816
I listened to you tell your
stupid story over and over again,

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:11.187
and I complimented your hat!

- Brad, we have to stop this.
- He's killing!

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:18.026
Don't you see what's happening?

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:20.028
I do. I see a room of people
laughing at my father.

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.162
- It's amazing.
- Okay.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:24.301
- Have some water.
- No, I don't want water.

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:28.636
Oh!

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:29.772
DON: I don't want water!

01:03:29.774 --> 01:03:31.540
I want my wife back.

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:35.676
And I want our Sunday brunches
at the Cracker Barrel.

Braddie, we've got to get him
off the stage.

01:03:38.082 --> 01:03:40.952
All you needed was
somebody to listen to you,

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.752
and all I do is talk.

01:03:43.754 --> 01:03:45.086
On and on and on.

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:48.993
When am I ever gonna learn
to shut my big fat mouth?

Son, you're home
from summer camp!

You are a part of this family, and
you will respect your parents.

- Brad.
- Just shut up.

Is he still around?

there and talk to him?

He won't talk to me,
and I don't blame him.

your fault.

me when he made that improv suggestion.

- It was pretty obvious, Don.

an improv group

joined an improv group.

- No! Well...

all right?

- I don't know. I hope not.

I just found out last night.
When did you find out?

- I was a baby.
- When you were a baby?

Were you a difficult baby?

I don't know.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:46.535

leads me to believe it was your fault.

No, no, no! You were not
a difficult baby, sweetheart.

about what happened, okay?

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:13.660
I thought we had an honest
relationship!

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.262
Oh, yeah? Brad,
I bet you never told him

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:17.265
about that procedure
you had last year, did you?

01:12:17.267 --> 01:12:18.533
Oh, my God. What procedure?

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:20.936
It was nothing,
just some benign tissue.

01:12:20.938 --> 01:12:24.070
How about that? You're both a
couple of lying sacks.

01:12:24.072 --> 01:12:25.239
And, you!

01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:26.473
From the minute you got here,

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.944
you've been nothing but
mean and sarcastic.

01:12:28.946 --> 01:12:30.278
Well, you know what, Kurt?

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.012
- F you!
- Dad!

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.614
That's right. Forget you!

Throwing down F words.

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.918
Not the F word, but an F word,
and that's a good start.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.055
Now, come on, give me the
finger, big boy. Come on.

01:12:40.057 --> 01:12:41.556
- Come on.
- ROGER: Hey! Hey!

01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:43.491
Are we gonna still fight
or what?

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:45.760
Roger brings up a good point.
Let's get the momentum back.

01:12:45.762 --> 01:12:48.329
Come on, Roger. Get some!
Let's get in there!

01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:50.765
- Come on!
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:12:50.767 --> 01:12:54.636
If you lay one hand on each other,
whether the kids are here or not,

01:12:54.638 --> 01:12:57.437
it will negatively impact them.

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.910
All right.
I'm not gonna lay a hand on him.

I've got some Nerf guns
in the back of my car.

01:13:08.919 --> 01:13:10.150
Want me to get them?

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:12.320
I pitched triple-A for the Red
Sox in their farm system, Roger.

01:13:12.322 --> 01:13:13.387
Don't say I didn't warn you.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:14.591
Take your best shot.

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:21.061

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:22.598
Don, I'm sorry!

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.466
That sucks.

01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:27.537
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it was all right.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.074
Hey, no fair.
That's an ice ball.

01:13:32.076 --> 01:13:33.374
You bet it is.

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:35.275
You know, you throw that
and we are no longer co-dads.

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:36.544
I'm way ahead of you, dickhead.

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:37.712
You know, from now on,

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:39.213
we'll just act like
a normal blended family

01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:40.280
with me hating your guts.

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:41.982
The kids will never know,

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:44.151
because I'm too good of a dad to ever
throw their stepfather under the bus.

01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:46.187
But that's right where
you're gonna be, Brad.

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:47.855
Under my bus.

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:50.857
Well, guess what, I'm gonna celebrate
you morning, noon and night

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:53.394
because it's the right thing to
do in front of the kids.

01:13:53.396 --> 01:13:55.396
But just know the way
I really feel about you

01:13:55.398 --> 01:13:57.598
is you can suck a fart, Dusty.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.504
A wet, greasy fart.

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:05.940
You gonna keep pump-faking that thing
or you gonna take a shot, Brad?

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.275
Huh?

He's never played sports ever.

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:14.047
Maybe it's stuck to his hand.

Oh! Oh!

01:14:25.262 --> 01:14:26.660
That's what I thought.

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.262

you're not worth it.

into town, all right?

Was it all the snow?

with the avalanche.

You heard me.
I said, I love my stepdaughter!

And I meant it. I should've said
it a long time ago,

01:24:58.161 --> 01:25:02.165

there and risk getting rejected.

fair amount of resentment towards me,

I love her, so that means
I love you, too.

about saying it,

01:31:13.335 --> 01:31:15.368
I don't want you to go, Pop-Pop!

01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:16.602
- Really?
- Yeah, really?

01:31:16.604 --> 01:31:17.971
Sure. Of course, he gets a hug.

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:21.074
Maybe you can call me and tell
me more Pop-Pop stories.

01:31:21.076 --> 01:31:22.609
I would love to!

01:31:22.611 --> 01:31:25.012
Oh. And I also signed you up
for SeniorMatch.com.

01:31:25.014 --> 01:31:27.413
It's a dating website
for old people like you.

01:31:27.415 --> 01:31:29.017
Thank you, sweetie.

01:31:29.718 --> 01:31:31.619
Honey, it's your mom texting.

01:31:31.621 --> 01:31:33.387
They're just getting
off the plane.

01:31:33.389 --> 01:31:34.820
I'd better go
before they get here.

01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:36.856
I don't want to make anything
awkward.

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:39.193
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, big man.

01:31:39.195 --> 01:31:41.798
- Love you.
- I love you, too, Brad.

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:45.034
Hey, well, yeah,
you have a good flight.

01:31:58.447 --> 01:32:00.413
Yeah, let's not get that going.

01:32:00.415 --> 01:32:01.647
I agree. You've got to start
that younger.

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:02.848
We missed that window.

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:04.116
I really appreciate the gesture.

01:32:04.118 --> 01:32:05.252
You do? Then okay.

01:32:05.254 --> 01:32:07.454
- Hey. I'll see you, kid.
- See you soon, yeah.

01:32:07.456 --> 01:32:08.855
Yeah, bye, kid.

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:11.527
- Are you coming, Pop-Pop?
- Come on, Captain!

01:32:12.059 --> 01:32:13.827
Bye, Dad.

01:32:13.829 --> 01:32:15.829
You know, Don,
I've been thinking.

01:32:15.831 --> 01:32:17.431
You don't need a dating app.

01:32:17.433 --> 01:32:19.731
What you need is a wingman.

01:32:19.733 --> 01:32:21.368
I switched our flights to Vegas.

01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:23.470
New Year's at Caesar's,
fix you right up.

01:32:23.472 --> 01:32:25.605
That sounds wonderful!

01:32:25.607 --> 01:32:27.607
Where are we connecting through?

01:32:27.609 --> 01:32:29.677
Don't start with me, Pop-Pop.

01:32:29.679 --> 01:32:31.878
Hey, Braddie.
Don't be nervous now.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:35.815
You are the kindest, most gentle
and honest guy I know.

01:32:35.817 --> 01:32:38.485
And whoever your mother
brings down that escalator,

01:32:38.487 --> 01:32:40.087
he's gonna love you,
you hear me?

01:32:40.089 --> 01:32:41.224
Grandma!

01:32:45.361 --> 01:32:46.963
Is that Sully?

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:49.062
Wait, wait, who?

01:32:49.064 --> 01:32:50.296
DUSTY: Sully Sullenberger.

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:53.132
The guy who saved 155 passengers
on the miracle on the Hudson!

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:54.935
Clint Eastwood made
a frickin' movie about it.

01:32:54.937 --> 01:32:56.802
Wait. We watched it at your
house, it was awesome!

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:58.271
Right. Tom Hanks
and Aaron Eckhart.

01:32:58.273 --> 01:32:59.772
I really enjoyed it.

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:02.545
That guy is a national hero,
and he's gonna be your stepdad.

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:03.843
Wow. Amazing.

01:33:03.845 --> 01:33:05.846
I bet you he gets free flight
vouchers.

01:33:05.848 --> 01:33:07.847
And maybe get us some vouchers!

01:33:07.849 --> 01:33:08.882
Maybe.

01:33:08.884 --> 01:33:11.551
Well, don't make him wait.
Go say hi. Go! Go!

01:33:11.553 --> 01:33:12.755
MEGAN: Grandma!

01:33:14.223 --> 01:33:16.355
You must be Brad.

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:17.423
Nope.

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:19.359
- No, Brad.
- You're not my dad!

01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:20.592
Brad, no, that's a mistake!

01:33:20.594 --> 01:33:22.529
I don't care how
many lives you saved!

01:33:22.531 --> 01:33:25.033
You'll never replace him,
do you hear me?

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:29.136
Brad, he's so nice! Come back!

01:33:29.138 --> 01:33:33.142
You only have one good story,
my father has a million!

You know. Last year, the folks
at St. Benedict's, they...

01:38:55.363 --> 01:38:56.963
They had a... A modern-dress
Nativity.

01:38:56.965 --> 01:39:00.667
Everybody hated it at first, but you
know the folks at St. Benedict's,

01:39:00.669 --> 01:39:02.235
they got back at 'em, all right.

01:39:02.237 --> 01:39:05.137
They won the prize for most
original.

01:39:05.139 --> 01:39:08.574
