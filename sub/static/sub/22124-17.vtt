09:05.632 --> 09:07.024
But he said something

09:07.068 --> 09:08.373
like, uh,

09:08.417 --> 09:11.115
"I hope Axara dies
a horrible, painful death."

09:11.159 --> 09:12.203
Yes.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.292
Mm, mm.

Suppose it might
be worth a glance.

09:44.105 --> 09:48.022
I don't want
to lose you, Maze.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.938
And so,

09:50.981 --> 09:53.288
I lost Amenadiel.

You're looking
for Patrick Manning?

10:24.493 --> 10:26.190
Yes.

That's me, honey.
LUCIFER:
Wow.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.455
I see someone stole some
of Axara's spotlight

10:30.499 --> 10:32.980
andfishnets as severance pay.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.111
Why am I here?

10:34.155 --> 10:35.547
I'll ask the questions, Patty.

10:35.591 --> 10:38.289
Oh, I always knew Cher
was a feisty one.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.465
I'm Donovan McCann,
Patrick's lawyer.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.946
So, why is he here?

10:42.990 --> 10:44.121
CHLOE: We believe
that Patrick made

10:44.165 --> 10:46.297
an attempt on Axara's life
last night.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.430
Killed a backup dancer

you still

10:49.518 --> 10:51.302

10:51.346 --> 10:52.564
which means
access and motive.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.044
LUCIFER: Yes,
cold-blooded retaliation

10:54.088 --> 10:55.132
for your recent firing.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.220
Firing?

10:56.264 --> 10:57.439
That's bananas.

10:57.482 --> 10:58.701
So you're saying
you didn't try

10:58.745 --> 11:00.355
and take Axara
out with a bang?

11:00.398 --> 11:01.225
Course not.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.226
PATRICK:
Do I hate her?

11:02.270 --> 11:03.358
Yes.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.099
It was a bitch
to work for that bitch--

11:05.142 --> 11:07.144
the long hours,
never getting credit--

11:07.188 --> 11:08.668
but she did not fire me.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.017
I quit.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.235
That's not the story her people
are telling.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.498
I bet. Those sycophants
will say anything

11:13.542 --> 11:14.978
to protect
her fragile ego.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.677
Well, Patrick. Patty.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.722
If you didn't want Axara dead,
tell me:

11:19.766 --> 11:22.333
what did you desire?

11:22.377 --> 11:26.163
Uh... to be Axara.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.730
But my version.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.689
A better version.

11:29.732 --> 11:32.735
Which is why I could never
want her dead.

11:32.779 --> 11:37.479
How could I compete with her
if she was kaput?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.742
Yes.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.052
Where were you last night?

11:45.095 --> 11:46.444
On stage.

11:46.488 --> 11:49.534
Performing my act at
the Hideaway in WeHo.

11:49.578 --> 11:52.407
After which, she was mobbed
by fans in the parking lot.

11:52.450 --> 11:53.538
Tuesday's the new Friday

11:53.582 --> 11:55.192

Aw, so sweet.

Donovan was right
about last night.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.547
It was cray-cray
at the Hideaway.

Everyone wants a piece
of Axara 2.0. [scoffs]

♪ I will survive

35:59.635 --> 36:02.725
♪ Hey, hey.

36:02.769 --> 36:05.728
[sighs] See?

36:05.772 --> 36:07.513
How could I
ever leave this?

36:07.556 --> 36:09.558
No one's ever gonna scare
me out of the spotlight.

36:09.602 --> 36:10.994
Ever.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.996
Yeah? Try me.
Come on.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.084
[scoffs]

36:14.128 --> 36:15.173
You.

36:17.610 --> 36:21.091
You were supposed
to keep her safe.

36:21.135 --> 36:24.617
No offense, darling, but
you're the one with a knife.

36:32.233 --> 36:33.669
AXARA: What's with
the knife, Cece?

36:33.713 --> 36:34.670
You're gonna hurt someone.

36:34.714 --> 36:35.845
Does it even matter?

36:35.889 --> 36:38.196
Two people are dead,
you were shot at,

36:38.239 --> 36:40.894
and you still won't stop.

36:40.937 --> 36:43.201
Don't you see the danger
you're in?

36:43.244 --> 36:46.639
Again, am I the only one
who sees the irony here?

36:46.682 --> 36:48.510
You said you would take a break
after the L.A. shows

36:48.554 --> 36:50.208
and then you added Asia
and Europe to the tour.

36:50.251 --> 36:51.513
That's two more years.

36:51.557 --> 36:52.775
So?
CECE:
So?!

36:52.819 --> 36:54.777
That's two more years now.

36:54.821 --> 36:55.778
And then another two
and another two.

36:55.822 --> 36:56.779
When does it end?

36:56.823 --> 36:58.041
Never.

36:58.085 --> 36:59.260
Hopefully.

36:59.304 --> 37:02.698
I am tired of sharing you,
Axara.

37:04.570 --> 37:05.658
Remember high school?

37:05.701 --> 37:08.051
Before all of this.

37:08.095 --> 37:12.534
It was just you and me,
singing along to Beyoncé.

37:12.578 --> 37:14.797
Well, you would sing,

37:14.841 --> 37:17.322
I-I would just watch
and eat cookie dough.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.239
I want that.

37:23.110 --> 37:25.243
You have to know by now.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.942
I love you.

37:28.985 --> 37:30.291
Love me?

37:32.206 --> 37:34.904
Oh, my God, Cece,
what did you do?

37:34.948 --> 37:36.341
She was trying to protect you.

37:36.384 --> 37:39.257
Force you out of the spotlight
by any means necessary.

37:39.300 --> 37:40.258
Even murder?

37:40.301 --> 37:42.564
I-I didn't know what else to do.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.566
You almost killed me.
How is that protecting me?

37:44.610 --> 37:45.828
She was never trying
to kill you.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.787
Oh, what is she doing here?

37:47.830 --> 37:49.136
CHLOE: Cece ran
your social media.

37:49.179 --> 37:51.921
It was easy for her
to start an account as you

37:51.965 --> 37:53.706
and access all of
your private texts.

37:53.749 --> 37:55.316
So you knew about
the choreography switch.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.840
I just wanted to scare you.

37:57.884 --> 37:59.929
I'm never gonna stop singing,
Cece.

37:59.973 --> 38:01.844
Not even for me?

38:01.888 --> 38:04.020
My music means more to me
than anything.

38:06.762 --> 38:08.634
You have to know that by now.

38:11.637 --> 38:14.596
Drop the knife,
Cece, it's over.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.989
[sobbing]:
No.

38:16.032 --> 38:17.991
No!

38:18.034 --> 38:19.775
No![audience gasps, screams]

38:21.908 --> 38:24.302
I just wanted her
to be safe.

38:24.345 --> 38:25.999
I know you did.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.965
Well, who's the heroic one, now?

38:36.009 --> 38:37.227
[chuckles]

38:38.794 --> 38:41.144
What?Oh, my God.
Lucifer, are you okay?

38:41.188 --> 38:43.625
Why wouldn't I be okay?

38:43.669 --> 38:44.800
Oh.

38:44.844 --> 38:46.672
Oh, God, whatever you do,
don't pull it...

38:46.715 --> 38:48.978
[grunts]...out!

38:49.022 --> 38:51.154
[chuckles weakly]
Oops.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.722
[grunts]

38:55.942 --> 38:57.117
What were you thinking,

38:57.160 --> 38:59.119
tackling somebody with a knife?

38:59.162 --> 39:01.730
It's not me I was worried about,
Detective.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.997
Lucifer.

39:09.912 --> 39:12.350
You see, it's like
I was saying, Pierce.

39:13.786 --> 39:17.355
You got to have faith
because life can surprise you.

39:17.398 --> 39:19.269
Now, if my brother,

39:19.313 --> 39:22.142
the Devil, can have that...

39:22.185 --> 39:24.797
[sighs]
Maybe I can, too.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.407
God.

39:33.849 --> 39:37.810
Hey, look at you, buddy.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.377
Seems like someone's
feeling better.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.206
Okay.

39:43.250 --> 39:46.384
PIERCE:
Hi.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.081
Lieutenant.

39:50.475 --> 39:52.694
Congratulations
on another solve.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.696
Thank you.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.219
Thanks, I appreciate that.

39:56.263 --> 39:58.091
I'm just glad
Axara's okay.

39:58.134 --> 40:00.441
Well, I guess more than okay.
Her show's back on for the night

40:00.485 --> 40:05.228
and she sent me two VIP tickets
to say thank you.

40:05.272 --> 40:06.229
Well, you deserve them.

40:06.273 --> 40:07.448
So, who are you taking?

40:07.492 --> 40:10.886
Oh, I don't know.
It's just...

40:10.930 --> 40:11.974
I thought you'd never ask.

40:12.018 --> 40:13.062
Oh.

40:13.106 --> 40:14.237
Yeah.

40:14.281 --> 40:15.848
Sure. Yeah, why not?

40:15.891 --> 40:17.850
Great, I'll see you later.Okay.

40:21.462 --> 40:24.247
LUCIFER:
Morning, Detective.

40:24.291 --> 40:25.988
What?
What?

40:26.032 --> 40:28.338
You sure you don't want
to throw a surprise party

40:28.382 --> 40:30.428
for the guy in evidence lockup?

40:30.471 --> 40:31.994
[chuckles]

40:32.038 --> 40:34.257
Ah, right, yes, I suppose
I deserve that.

40:34.301 --> 40:37.130
No, no, I am back
to status quo.

40:37.173 --> 40:38.958
Hmm.
Since I realized,

40:39.001 --> 40:41.874
ultimately, I can't control you

40:41.917 --> 40:43.397
or the world around you,
for that matter.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.399
So there's no point
trying to extinguish

40:45.443 --> 40:47.923
the proverbial spotlight,
is there?

40:47.967 --> 40:50.404
I may just have to take a knife
to the chest every now and then.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.145
[chuckles]
Right.

40:52.188 --> 40:55.017
Hello.

40:55.061 --> 40:57.106
Tickets for Axara's
show. Tonight?

40:57.150 --> 40:58.891
Excellent.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.109
Right, what time
shall I pick you up?

41:00.153 --> 41:02.982
Um...

41:03.025 --> 41:04.374
Well...

41:04.418 --> 41:07.508
it didn't seem like
you were that interested

41:07.552 --> 41:09.292
in hanging out
with me lately,

41:09.336 --> 41:11.294
so Pierce and I
are gonna go together.

41:11.338 --> 41:14.472
Oh. Right, yeah, of course.

41:14.515 --> 41:16.299
[laughing]:
Of course. Well...

41:16.343 --> 41:18.301
have fun.
