00:00.526 --> 00:01.811
My name is Michael Westen.

00:02.092 --> 00:03.782
I used to be a spy until...

00:04.725 --> 00:07.225
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.292 --> 00:09.658
When you're burned,
you've got nothing -

00:09.725 --> 00:12.325
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.392 --> 00:14.492
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.558 --> 00:16.292
Where am i?
Miami.

00:16.359 --> 00:19.359
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.426 --> 00:22.591
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

00:22.658 --> 00:24.259
A trigger-happy
ex-girlfriend...

00:24.325 --> 00:25.925
Should we shoot them?

00:25.992 --> 00:28.426
...an old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:28.492 --> 00:30.825
you know spies -
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.892 --> 00:33.325
...family, too...
hey, is that your mom again?

00:33.392 --> 00:35.526
...if you're desperate. Someone
needs your help, Michael.

00:35.591 --> 00:37.992
Bottom line -
As long as you're burned,

00:38.059 --> 00:39.758
You're not going anywhere.

00:43.025 --> 00:45.125
Previously on "Burn Notice"...

00:45.192 --> 00:48.059
I want you people
out of my life!

00:48.125 --> 00:51.092
Tell me, Michael, all your old
enemies from your spy days -

00:51.159 --> 00:52.992
Where do you think
they've been?

00:53.059 --> 00:54.492
You've been
under our protection!

00:54.558 --> 00:56.526
You want out?

00:58.325 --> 01:00.159
There's the door.

01:00.225 --> 01:02.658
You have no idea
what hell will rain down

01:02.725 --> 01:05.259
If we stop watching out
for you!

01:06.492 --> 01:10.292
Your shades got delivered
to the loft, along with this.

01:13.925 --> 01:17.691
Come on in, Michael.
The water's warm.

01:17.758 --> 01:20.526
You're to steal flight data
for every private plane

01:20.591 --> 01:23.325
Flying in and out of Miami
for the next six weeks.

01:23.392 --> 01:25.492
You get that when
it's mandated by the government.

01:25.558 --> 01:27.526
This is some kind of
serious black flight, Mike.

01:27.591 --> 01:29.059
You found out what's
on that flight.

01:29.125 --> 01:30.426
Not what, it's who.

01:30.492 --> 01:32.292
Who's on the flight?

01:32.359 --> 01:34.925
His name is Simon.
Paid me $10 million.

01:34.992 --> 01:38.426
Turns out his plan was
to shoot me, come after you.

01:38.492 --> 01:41.192
Did I mention I'm attached
to an explosive device?

01:58.359 --> 02:00.459
Sam: Mike, what the hell
is going on over there?

02:00.526 --> 02:01.858
Sam, gilroy's dead.

02:01.925 --> 02:03.691
You know that prisoner
he was helping escape?

02:03.758 --> 02:04.691
Don't tell me.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.758
He's out, Sam. He's free.

02:06.825 --> 02:09.758
The whole reason we were
getting involved here, Mike,

02:09.824 --> 02:11.092
Was so he didn't!

02:11.159 --> 02:12.625
No need to remind me!

02:14.459 --> 02:16.591
His name's Simon.
That's all I know.

02:18.325 --> 02:20.426
Right now, I just need
to get clear of the cops.

02:20.492 --> 02:23.159
Mike, it's not just the cops.
The FBI is involved now.

02:23.225 --> 02:24.958
Homeland security's
on alert.

02:25.025 --> 02:27.092
Pretty soon, it's gonna be
the i.R.S., the forest service,

02:27.159 --> 02:28.558
And the food and drug
administration

02:28.625 --> 02:29.725
Are gonna
be looking for you.

02:29.792 --> 02:31.591
I'm headed
into the canal streets.

02:31.658 --> 02:33.392
I'll do my best
to stay clear.

02:33.459 --> 02:34.758
See if you can do
a little recon for me.

02:34.825 --> 02:36.392
You got it, brother.

02:36.459 --> 02:38.192
Holy crap-Oly.

02:48.526 --> 02:50.758
Spies are in
the law-Breaking business.

02:50.825 --> 02:53.092
Call it espionage, covert ops,
whatever you like.

02:53.159 --> 02:54.725
When you get right down to it,

02:54.792 --> 02:57.825
You're a criminal
working for a good cause.

02:59.558 --> 03:01.558
When your job involves
daily law-Breaking,

03:01.625 --> 03:03.325
Chances are you're going to
find yourself

03:03.392 --> 03:05.725
On the wrong end of a manhunt
at some point.

03:08.192 --> 03:12.558
I'm at the corner
of canal and 155th street.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.526
Suspect is on foot.

03:14.591 --> 03:17.092
Need backup a.S.A.P.
Copy?

03:19.691 --> 03:22.359
I don't want to hurt you.
Just stop. Ugh!

03:22.426 --> 03:23.591
Just stop!

03:47.792 --> 03:50.192
It's hard to get used to the
idea that doing the right thing

03:50.259 --> 03:52.691
Can mean being
public enemy number one.

03:52.758 --> 03:55.459
Stop right now! Put your hands
on your head now!

03:55.526 --> 03:57.625
The good news is you're usually
too busy trying to survive

03:57.691 --> 03:59.392
To get upset.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.925
Usually, the best thing
is to get away,

04:03.992 --> 04:05.858
Deal with the situation,

04:05.925 --> 04:09.758
And hope people
are in a forgiving mood.

04:27.888 --> 04:29.888
Commuter parking lots
are great for fugitives.

04:29.954 --> 04:32.588
You can get some sleep while
your pursuers lose momentum

04:32.654 --> 04:35.188
To exhaustion
and shift changes.

04:35.255 --> 04:39.388
It's also one-Stop shopping
for dry clothes or a new phone.

04:56.721 --> 04:58.221
Sam, it's me.

04:58.288 --> 05:00.754
You've reached Sam axe's
fugitive-Assistance service.

05:00.821 --> 05:02.988
Sam speaking.
How was your night?

05:03.054 --> 05:04.455
Not bad,
under the circumstances.

05:04.522 --> 05:06.021
That's a silver lining,
I suppose,

05:06.088 --> 05:07.622
'Cause I'm looking
at the dark cloud.

05:07.687 --> 05:09.288
Your place is crawling
with surveillance.

05:09.355 --> 05:12.854
You got two teams drinking
convenience-Store coffee.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.221
I guess they saw
your car was gone

05:14.288 --> 05:15.921
And decided to wait up
all night long to surprise you.

05:15.988 --> 05:17.754
I guess I'm not going
back to my place, then.

05:17.821 --> 05:19.355
Listen,
we got to get Simon.

05:19.421 --> 05:21.021
The kind of guy who escapes
from a black flight...

05:21.088 --> 05:22.821
is not the kind of guy you want
mixed in with the general public.

05:22.888 --> 05:24.155
Yeah, I'm with you.

05:24.221 --> 05:26.155
So, I called Fi, suggested
we rally and make a plan.

05:26.221 --> 05:27.854
Called your ma, too.

05:27.921 --> 05:29.088
Meet at the emergency spot?

05:29.155 --> 05:30.687
No.

05:30.754 --> 05:33.421
I'm thinking we should meet
at the emergency emergency spot.

05:33.488 --> 05:35.155
See you there.

05:55.821 --> 05:56.954
Madeline Westen?

05:57.021 --> 05:58.622
Yes.

05:58.687 --> 06:00.954
My name is agent callahan.
I'm with the FBI.

06:03.787 --> 06:05.622
We need to talk to you
about your son Michael.

06:07.288 --> 06:10.888
So, were you, um...
were you planning a trip?

06:10.954 --> 06:13.455
Oh, no.
No, I'm just...

06:13.522 --> 06:15.488
going out of town
for a while, you know?

06:15.555 --> 06:16.988
No, no. I-I don't know.

06:17.054 --> 06:18.888
Is the answer, "no,
you weren't planning a trip,"

06:18.954 --> 06:20.821
Or, "yes, you ||
getting out of town?"

06:20.888 --> 06:23.188
I'm going on a day-Trip.

06:26.188 --> 06:28.255
And do you usually bring
a pump-Action shotgun with you

06:28.321 --> 06:30.155
On a day-Trip?

06:30.221 --> 06:32.021
Can't be too careful
these days.

06:33.355 --> 06:34.787
Ma'am, I'll get
right to the point.

06:34.854 --> 06:37.954
Your son
is in a lot of trouble.

06:38.021 --> 06:40.622
And I just want to bring him in
and get the facts.

06:40.687 --> 06:43.687
And until then, he is in
an enormous amount of danger.

06:43.754 --> 06:45.888
So, please...

06:45.954 --> 06:47.854
help me help him.

06:47.921 --> 06:50.954
Now, I assume
from your day-Trip bag here

06:51.021 --> 06:52.388
That you have a way
of reaching him.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.687
I'd like you to call him...

06:56.388 --> 06:58.188
...and set up a meeting.

07:06.787 --> 07:07.654
Now.

07:11.821 --> 07:14.421
<i>Spies love places
people tend to avoid -</i>

07:14.488 --> 07:17.388
<i>Sewage plants,
toxic dumps, condemned motels,</i>

07:17.455 --> 07:19.721
<i>All places
you can put emergency supplies</i>

07:19.787 --> 07:21.288
<i>And not worry about
whether they'll be there</i>

07:21.355 --> 07:22.988
<i>When you need them.</i>

07:26.288 --> 07:28.555
Well, we got enough
firepower for an army.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.488
Unfortunately,
we're a little light on snacks.

07:30.555 --> 07:32.021
There was no place for a fridge,

07:32.088 --> 07:33.888
So we got no yogurt
and we got no beer.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.088
I think we're gonna
be all right, Sam.

07:36.555 --> 07:38.888
<i>Mike, this is the
emergency emergency phone.</i>

07:38.954 --> 07:41.221
The only person
who knows this number aside

07:41.288 --> 07:42.988
From the three of us
is your ma.

07:45.355 --> 07:46.754
Hello?

07:46.821 --> 07:49.321
Michael, i-It's me.

07:49.388 --> 07:51.054
Uh, there's been
a change of plans.

07:51.121 --> 07:53.821
I want you to come home
right now.

07:53.888 --> 07:55.988
I need to talk to you.
Mom, is something -

07:56.054 --> 07:59.155
Good.
I'll see you soon, then.

08:00.754 --> 08:02.622
She said to come home
right now.

08:02.687 --> 08:05.888
It's what she used to say
when my dad was on a bender

08:05.954 --> 08:07.588
And she wanted me
to stay away from the house.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.821
You think that she -

08:08.888 --> 08:10.488
The FBI went
everywhere else.

08:10.555 --> 08:12.088
Oh, Mike, they're gonna
come at her hard.

08:12.155 --> 08:14.021
She knows the cars we drive,
our contacts.

08:14.088 --> 08:16.687
I mean, she's good, but she's not
gonna be able to hold out forever.

08:16.754 --> 08:19.355
I have faith in her.
She'll be fine.

08:31.121 --> 08:32.221
So, listen, Mike, um...

08:32.288 --> 08:33.687
me and fi
want to talk to you

08:33.754 --> 08:35.421
About this whole business
with Simon.

08:35.488 --> 08:37.754
Neither of us liked you
getting involved with gilroy

08:37.821 --> 08:38.888
In the beginning.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.255
I didn't have a choice.
I had to -

08:40.321 --> 08:42.188
Look, Mike, I know
you did what you had to do,

08:42.255 --> 08:43.587
But we got
a situation here.

08:43.654 --> 08:46.588
We're with you,
but no more lone-Wolf crap.

08:46.654 --> 08:49.054
We got to know
that you're with us.

08:49.121 --> 08:50.754
I'm with you.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.088
Good. All right, we're gonna
do it right this time.

08:53.155 --> 08:54.888
We're gonna be careful, we're
gonna watch each other's backs.

08:54.954 --> 08:56.455
Combat knives for everyone,
just in case.

08:56.522 --> 08:58.054
Thanks.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.921
I'm sorry, guys.

09:01.588 --> 09:02.787
Was that an apology?

09:06.854 --> 09:09.388
Okay, we got to keep moving
here, stay ahead of Simon.

09:09.455 --> 09:10.687
Any ideas?

09:10.754 --> 09:12.854
He killed gilroy
with explosives.

09:12.921 --> 09:16.155
I assume gilroy didn't make
the bomb that killed him,

09:16.221 --> 09:18.754
So Simon's got to have an
explosives expert in Miami. Fi?

09:18.821 --> 09:20.388
Yeah, I'll track down
the supplier.

09:20.455 --> 09:22.821
I have the rest of my stuff
on gilroy in the charger.

09:22.888 --> 09:24.355
It's parked
in coral gables.

09:24.421 --> 09:26.355
Keep your head down,
Mikey.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.721
<i>A good operative doesn't
believe in coincidences.</i>

09:36.988 --> 09:38.754
<i>It's true, of course,
that food stands catch fire</i>

09:38.821 --> 09:40.221
<i>From time to time.</i>

09:40.288 --> 09:42.288
<i>It's even possible
that one might catch fire</i>

09:42.355 --> 09:45.088
<i>At the Same time you happen to
be looking for a violent fugitive.</i>

09:48.288 --> 09:52.288
<i>But it's sure not likely.</i>

10:18.787 --> 10:21.188
Simon:
any of it look familiar?

10:26.622 --> 10:28.954
Not really.

10:29.021 --> 10:31.787
These little incidents...

10:31.854 --> 10:33.421
you'll be interested
to know...

10:33.488 --> 10:35.687
are all things
you're accused of doing -

10:35.754 --> 10:38.522
The very things that
earned you your burn notice.

10:38.588 --> 10:42.054
Chechnya, 2002.

10:42.121 --> 10:43.787
You read your file,
didn't you?

10:43.854 --> 10:45.754
50 people dead.

10:45.821 --> 10:48.021
It was 54, actually,

10:48.088 --> 10:49.988
But I guess some journalist
got lazy.

10:50.054 --> 10:51.355
I didn't do that.

10:51.421 --> 10:53.787
I didn't do
any of these things.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.555
<i>I know that. I did.</i>

10:58.388 --> 10:59.821
All of it?

10:59.888 --> 11:01.255
You?

11:01.321 --> 11:04.355
Well...
not the boring parts.

11:04.421 --> 11:07.787
But the greatest hits -
These were mine.

11:07.854 --> 11:09.088
We're leaving, Simon.

11:09.155 --> 11:11.522
You're getting back
on an airplane. Let's go.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.421
No.
We won't be doing that.

11:14.488 --> 11:16.321
We're gonna have
a conversation.

11:18.622 --> 11:23.687
A few tons of explosives
in a hotel in Miami beach.

11:23.754 --> 11:25.622
There's the detonator...

11:25.687 --> 11:26.921
fuel-And-Fertilizer
mixture.

11:29.954 --> 11:33.188
Behave, or that screen
gets a lot more exciting.

11:34.821 --> 11:37.355
Gun down,
phone on the counter.

11:37.421 --> 11:38.988
Now.

11:43.188 --> 11:44.787
Thank you.

11:44.854 --> 11:46.721
We need to have
a good working relationship.

11:46.787 --> 11:49.221
You see, you're gonna
help me with something.

11:49.288 --> 11:50.954
Why would I want
to help you?

11:51.021 --> 11:54.588
The powers that be decided
that I was uncontrollable.

11:54.654 --> 11:56.954
They dumped me in a hole.

11:57.021 --> 11:58.954
They transferred
my file to you,

11:59.021 --> 12:00.921
Gave you
a fearsome reputation -

12:00.988 --> 12:04.054
My reputation.

12:04.121 --> 12:05.421
Do you want it?

12:05.488 --> 12:08.321
I want my life back.

12:08.388 --> 12:09.488
Fine.

12:09.555 --> 12:12.054
It's yours. Take it.

12:12.121 --> 12:13.555
I will.

12:13.622 --> 12:17.121
To do that, we need -
You know him as "management."

12:17.188 --> 12:20.188
You're gonna bring him
to Miami for me.

12:20.255 --> 12:22.221
You want me
to bring you management?

12:22.288 --> 12:24.121
He ruined my life.

12:24.188 --> 12:25.854
We're not on good terms.

12:25.921 --> 12:27.888
He wants you
back in the fold.

12:27.954 --> 12:29.754
He'll come when you call.

12:29.821 --> 12:31.522
You'll have to
convince him, or...

12:32.821 --> 12:35.555
...BO-O-O-M!

12:37.021 --> 12:39.388
I've been watching
your career in Miami.

12:39.455 --> 12:42.455
Just think of me as one of those
people you help in your spare time -

12:42.522 --> 12:44.455
A desperate fella
with a problem.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.814
<i>As a spy, you want to work with
people with clear alliances.</i>

12:56.881 --> 12:58.714
<i>The biggest monster
in the world</i>

12:58.781 --> 13:01.480
<i>Becomes pretty predictable
on a government payroll.</i>

13:01.547 --> 13:03.981
<i>Your worst nightmare
is a lone crazy person.</i>

13:06.514 --> 13:08.547
Red phosphorous
under the cooktop.

13:08.614 --> 13:10.413
They'll be putting that out
for days.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.313
Simon,
just so we're clear -

13:12.380 --> 13:14.114
You need me to get in touch
with management.

13:14.181 --> 13:15.647
Yeah, I want you
to bring him

13:15.714 --> 13:18.181
To the government building
at 703 grand avenue

13:18.248 --> 13:19.847
At 6:00 p.M.

13:19.914 --> 13:21.347
Tell him
you want a new identity.

13:21.413 --> 13:23.081
Tell him - Tell him
you want a shetland pony.

13:23.148 --> 13:25.447
I don't care.
Just get him there.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.447
I can try, but I need to go
back to my loft to do it.

13:27.514 --> 13:28.547
Well, let's take
a ride, then.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.014
Wait, wait.

13:32.081 --> 13:33.814
I don't like waiting.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.148
The van.

13:35.214 --> 13:37.248
Surveillance. They went around
the block three times.

13:37.313 --> 13:39.547
They probably picked me up
on one of the traffic cams.

13:39.614 --> 13:40.947
Let's kill him
and be done with it.

13:41.014 --> 13:43.781
Listen.
This is an opportunity.

13:43.847 --> 13:45.248
I need to find out
what kind of surveillance

13:45.313 --> 13:47.647
Is on me at the loft -
I have to talk to the guy.

13:47.714 --> 13:50.214
We have a busy day,
Michael.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.514
Do you have any idea how much
heat there is on me right now?

13:52.580 --> 13:54.248
We rush this, we're dead.

13:55.814 --> 13:59.280
Stay here.
Keep an eye on the cops.

14:02.814 --> 14:04.014
Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

14:04.081 --> 14:05.881
Sorry, man,
if you're looking

14:05.947 --> 14:08.680
To buy something off the truck,
I can't do it.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.447
What the hell
are you doing?!

14:11.514 --> 14:13.847
You scream, you die.
Do you want to live?

14:13.914 --> 14:16.347
Keep your mouth shut and run
as fast as you can that way.

14:17.447 --> 14:19.148
Can I borrow your phone?

14:19.947 --> 14:21.647
Go.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.114
Sam: hello?

14:29.181 --> 14:31.447
<i>Sam, it's me. I don't have
a lot of time. Simon found me.</i>

14:31.514 --> 14:32.714
Ah, jesus, Mike.

14:32.781 --> 14:34.747
He wants me
to get management to Miami.

14:34.814 --> 14:35.747
Management?

14:35.814 --> 14:37.081
Long story.

14:37.148 --> 14:39.480
When you were at my loft,
did you see a way in?

14:39.547 --> 14:40.881
No, they got it
surrounded, Mike -

14:40.947 --> 14:42.580
You know, the marina,
the container yard.

14:42.647 --> 14:43.847
Best bet is the river.

14:43.914 --> 14:45.580
You could go up a couple
hundred yards and swim,

14:45.647 --> 14:46.981
But are you sure
you want to do that?

14:47.047 --> 14:49.647
If I don't, Simon's
gonna blow up a hotel.

14:49.714 --> 14:52.313
Oh, great.
Any idea which one?

14:52.380 --> 14:53.547
That'd be too easy.

14:53.614 --> 14:55.680
You and fI got to
find that bomb.

14:55.747 --> 14:58.580
Well, she's twisting arms
and calling in favors,

14:58.647 --> 15:00.014
So we're doing what we can.

15:00.081 --> 15:02.647
But, Mike, don't let Simon
out of your sight, okay?

15:02.714 --> 15:04.413
Give us some time
to get to a phone.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.248
We find the bomb,
you take this guy out.

15:06.313 --> 15:09.081
I'll do my best, Sam.

15:18.248 --> 15:20.148
There you are -
I was beginning to think

15:20.214 --> 15:21.647
You didn't understand
our arrangement.

15:21.714 --> 15:23.047
I got what I needed.

15:23.114 --> 15:25.480
Two FBI teams are watching
my place, but I know a way in.

15:25.547 --> 15:29.680
And the surveillance?
I took care of him.

15:29.747 --> 15:31.881
Michael, didn't think
you had it in you.

15:39.214 --> 15:41.747
So, that was a signal, then?

15:41.814 --> 15:43.280
You warned him off.

15:43.347 --> 15:44.881
What are you talking about?
He said he's -

15:44.947 --> 15:46.047
Don't play games with me!

15:46.114 --> 15:46.914
I'm not!

15:48.214 --> 15:50.114
How much do you know

15:50.181 --> 15:52.347
About your son's situation,
mrs. Westen?

15:52.413 --> 15:54.447
I prefer to give him
his privacy.

15:54.514 --> 15:55.981
Do you know what he does?

15:56.047 --> 15:58.514
He kills people.

15:58.580 --> 15:59.881
Yeah.

15:59.947 --> 16:01.781
Look at that.

16:06.081 --> 16:08.747
I have to get something
from the kitchen.

16:08.814 --> 16:10.580
No, no,
I want you to sit down,

16:10.647 --> 16:13.081
And I want you
to look at that.

16:13.148 --> 16:14.981
That was just three years ago
in jordan.

16:15.047 --> 16:17.480
30 people were on that bus.

16:17.547 --> 16:20.114
15 survived,
all of them maimed.

16:22.714 --> 16:24.047
He didn't do this.

16:24.114 --> 16:26.280
Oh, come on. What, you think
he's gonna tell his mother?

16:26.347 --> 16:27.413
You think he's gonna say,

16:27.480 --> 16:28.981
"Sorry, mom.
I blew up a bus today"?

16:29.047 --> 16:32.181
People get burned
for a reason, mrs. Westen.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.214
Please. Where were you going
to meet your son?

16:44.881 --> 16:46.680
The sawgrass mills mall.

16:48.047 --> 16:49.347
The food court.

16:51.181 --> 16:52.647
Thank you.

16:57.914 --> 17:00.480
Sam: so, that's our
hotel bomber's house.

17:00.547 --> 17:03.647
It better be...
or I know a gun dealer

17:03.714 --> 17:05.181
Who's gonna be choking
on my high heel.

17:05.248 --> 17:06.413
Looks like he's home.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.214
From what I hear,
he doesn't get out much.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.413
And he's got more guns in there
than a little african country.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.814
Probably shouldn't knock
on the front door, then.

17:14.579 --> 17:15.814
Fi, how does
this baby handle?

17:20.814 --> 17:23.147
<i>When entering
a possible combat situation,</i>

17:23.214 --> 17:25.280
<i>You want the element
of surprise on your side.</i>

17:25.347 --> 17:28.513
<i>It's why special forces like to
rappel down from helicopters.</i>

17:30.014 --> 17:31.981
<i>Of course,
if you don't have a helicopter,</i>

17:32.047 --> 17:34.014
<i>You may have to improvise.</i>

17:41.947 --> 17:43.480
Hi, honey! I'm home!

17:43.547 --> 17:44.747
Unh-Unh!

17:44.814 --> 17:46.781
Hands up.

17:58.181 --> 18:00.714
I ain't got anything else
to tell you, man.

18:00.781 --> 18:02.547
I came down
from rhode island,

18:02.614 --> 18:04.847
Picked up a couple of jobs
doing demolitions -

18:04.914 --> 18:06.580
A little side work
for a biker gang.

18:06.647 --> 18:08.148
You are operating
on my turf.

18:08.214 --> 18:11.047
That biker gang -
They told me how to find you.

18:11.114 --> 18:13.447
You see, keith,
if I ask them

18:13.514 --> 18:16.148
To drag you back to rhode island
behind their harleys,

18:16.214 --> 18:19.280
They would, just so that I would
owe them a favor, capiche?

18:19.347 --> 18:21.081
Yeah.

18:21.148 --> 18:24.114
So, answer my questions
about this little hotel bomb,

18:24.181 --> 18:26.480
Or take your chances
with the bikers.

18:26.547 --> 18:28.047
I just did
what the guy said.

18:28.114 --> 18:30.114
He gave me the specs,
I made the device,

18:30.181 --> 18:32.248
I put it in a basement
at the epic hotel.

18:32.313 --> 18:34.914
Okay, so you just put a bomb
in a hotel just like that,

18:34.981 --> 18:36.214
Like washing your car?

18:36.280 --> 18:37.814
I was gonna
turn the job down.

18:37.881 --> 18:39.413
But this guy's nuts.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.881
He's grade-"A" psycho.
You would like him.

18:41.947 --> 18:44.280
This device -
How's it set up?

18:44.347 --> 18:45.781
It's airtight.

18:45.847 --> 18:47.881
It's got a timer
and a remote.

18:47.947 --> 18:50.380
Epic hotel. We better
get down there.

18:50.447 --> 18:51.714
You sit tight.

18:51.781 --> 18:54.081
The cops will be here
any minute.

18:56.614 --> 18:59.313
It's insulting, really.

18:59.380 --> 19:00.747
They give you my file -

19:00.814 --> 19:03.413
You'd think they could set you
up in a nicer neighborhood.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.947
It grows on you.

19:05.014 --> 19:08.914
My place - Just across
the canal, around the bridge.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.647
It looks clear.
Shall we?

19:11.714 --> 19:13.447
There is no "we."

19:13.514 --> 19:14.947
The FBI's all over my place.

19:15.014 --> 19:17.280
I think we can handle
a few guys in suits.

19:17.347 --> 19:19.380
I'm swimming across the canal,
scaling a back wall,

19:19.447 --> 19:20.781
And coming in
through the roof.

19:20.847 --> 19:22.747
<i>I'm not sure I can do that alone
without being seen.</i>

19:22.814 --> 19:24.181
The two of us -
We don't stand a chance.

19:24.248 --> 19:26.847
You got 10 minutes.
How's that sound?

19:26.914 --> 19:28.881
10 minutes?
Sounds like a joke.

19:28.947 --> 19:31.047
Well, what can I say?
I'm hilarious.

19:32.313 --> 19:33.181
Go.

19:51.814 --> 19:53.947
Agent: hear that?

19:54.014 --> 19:55.781
I think
someone's on the roof.

19:55.847 --> 19:57.981
Radio the boys.
We'd better check it out.

20:09.114 --> 20:10.914
<i>Work in intelligence
long enough,</i>

20:10.981 --> 20:14.347
<i>And you hang on
to phone numbers.</i>

20:14.413 --> 20:15.714
<i>No matter who your enemy is,</i>

20:15.781 --> 20:18.280
<i>There's a chance
you'll need him tomorrow.</i>

20:18.347 --> 20:20.413
<i>Churchill and stalin
weren't chummy in 1941,</i>

20:20.480 --> 20:22.380
<i>But once the nazis
marched on moscow,</i>

20:22.447 --> 20:24.248
<i>They got past
their differences.</i>

20:26.914 --> 20:28.280
Operator:
answering service.

20:28.347 --> 20:31.181
This is Michael Westen.
I need to speak to management.

20:31.248 --> 20:32.847
One moment, please.

20:34.514 --> 20:35.747
Management:
Michael Westen.

20:35.814 --> 20:37.547
So...

20:37.614 --> 20:39.014
changed your mind?

20:39.081 --> 20:41.914
I'm calling about a former
employee of yours - Simon.

20:43.447 --> 20:44.981
How do you know
about Simon?

20:45.047 --> 20:46.881
I know about Simon

20:46.947 --> 20:49.181
Because he escaped from
whatever hole you put him in,

20:49.248 --> 20:50.781
And now he wants your head!

20:50.847 --> 20:52.814
He wants me to get you

20:52.881 --> 20:56.714
To a government building
on grand ave by 6:00 P.M.

20:56.781 --> 20:59.047
Keep him where he is.
I'll get a team to you.

20:59.114 --> 21:00.447
He's not that stupid.

21:00.514 --> 21:01.981
Right now, all we have

21:02.047 --> 21:04.347
Is he thinks I'm willing
to hand you over

21:04.413 --> 21:06.014
If it means
clearing my name.

21:06.081 --> 21:07.881
Ah.

21:07.947 --> 21:10.081
And you have a proposal?

21:10.148 --> 21:12.148
You come just like he wants,
you bring a team,

21:12.214 --> 21:15.014
And you take him down
when he comes after you.

21:15.081 --> 21:16.781
Fine.

21:16.847 --> 21:20.680
But know this -
You're my insurance.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.114
If this goes wrong,

21:22.181 --> 21:25.580
I wouldn't want to be you
or anyone who knows you.

21:28.181 --> 21:31.047
I figured.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.614
Got to go.
Talk to you later.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.114
When a trained team
is advancing on your position,

21:37.181 --> 21:39.580
Sneaking away
is usually impossible.

21:39.647 --> 21:42.514
>Your best bet is to give them
something else to worry about.

21:55.541 --> 21:58.808
And...
9 minutes, 30 seconds!

21:58.875 --> 21:59.942
I was getting itchy.

22:00.008 --> 22:01.841
I talked
to our mutual friend.

22:01.908 --> 22:03.374
It's set.
We're meeting at 6:00.

22:03.441 --> 22:04.641
Very good.

22:04.708 --> 22:06.641
Michael, I know
this makes you unhappy.

22:06.708 --> 22:08.274
But that old man
has it coming.

22:08.341 --> 22:10.441
Just think of me
as an instrument of justice.

22:10.508 --> 22:12.508
Yeah. I'll try to wrap
my head around that.

22:12.575 --> 22:13.608
We should move now.

22:13.675 --> 22:14.775
Oh.

22:37.675 --> 22:38.841
Take a right up here.

22:38.908 --> 22:40.308
If we cut through
the warehouse district,

22:40.374 --> 22:41.675
We can lose them
in the alleys.

22:41.741 --> 22:43.741
Thanks. I like this route
just fine.

22:43.808 --> 22:45.374
Listen to me.
They're gaining on us.

22:45.441 --> 22:48.141
If they catch us, they're gonna
cut us off at the causeway.

22:48.207 --> 22:49.107
Or not.

23:22.241 --> 23:23.608
Whoo!

23:23.675 --> 23:27.141
You pull something like that
again, and I'll end this now.

23:27.207 --> 23:30.875
Aah! Aah!

23:30.942 --> 23:32.274
Will you really?

23:32.341 --> 23:34.008
You want to run around Miami

23:34.074 --> 23:36.107
Playing "which hotel's
gonna blow up" after I'm dead?

23:36.174 --> 23:39.575
See, if I was you,
I'd just go ahead and do it.

23:39.641 --> 23:42.708
But then, I like a hotel blowing
up every once in a while.

23:45.474 --> 23:46.675
What's it gonna be?

23:50.908 --> 23:52.274
Just drive.

23:57.908 --> 24:00.808
Any fatalities?

24:00.875 --> 24:02.474
Okay. Thanks.

24:06.508 --> 24:07.975
Sawgrass mills mall, huh?

24:08.042 --> 24:09.508
Mm-Hmm.

24:09.575 --> 24:11.341
Well, we went up there.
Nothing.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.074
You know, mrs. Westen,
at this point,

24:13.141 --> 24:15.274
I could charge you with
aiding and abetting a felon.

24:15.341 --> 24:18.042
Nothing there?
Probably just a senior moment.

24:18.107 --> 24:21.274
You know, sometimes I put
my phone in the freezer.

24:21.341 --> 24:25.308
Enough! Your son just caused
a major accident on river road.

24:25.374 --> 24:27.308
I don't know anything.

24:27.374 --> 24:29.042
People were injured!
My people!

24:29.107 --> 24:30.341
These are men with families!

24:30.408 --> 24:32.107
And you're sitting there
and letting it happen!

24:32.174 --> 24:33.374
Got some stuff
from the garage -

24:33.441 --> 24:35.341
Modified shotgun rounds,
some listening devices,

24:35.408 --> 24:37.107
Bomb-Making components.

24:37.174 --> 24:39.341
So, what do you have to
say about this?

24:39.408 --> 24:40.708
Those are mine.

24:40.775 --> 24:42.374
Whoa, whoa,
before you continue,

24:42.441 --> 24:44.207
Let me be perfectly clear,
mrs. Westen.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.675
You are now confessing
to federal crimes -

24:46.741 --> 24:48.374
Crimes your son committed.

24:48.441 --> 24:50.708
Now, that may seem
very noble right now,

24:50.775 --> 24:52.474
But believe me, after
you're in a federal prison

24:52.541 --> 24:54.074
For a few years,
you will feel very different.

24:56.074 --> 24:59.675
Look, believe it or
not, I'm trying to help you.

24:59.741 --> 25:02.708
I want to get Michael
in one piece.

25:02.775 --> 25:04.274
Those men out there,
the ones he hurt -

25:04.341 --> 25:06.808
They don't care anymore.

25:06.875 --> 25:08.508
What does that mean?

25:08.575 --> 25:12.241
It means they will shoot first
and ask questions later.

25:24.575 --> 25:27.341
Ha! It's funny -
You never really know a car

25:27.408 --> 25:28.875
Until you drive it
through a wall.

25:28.942 --> 25:30.575
This little baby did good.

25:30.641 --> 25:32.241
Hey, keep it out front here,
will you?

25:32.308 --> 25:34.042
Just got a quick errand.
Thank you, sir.

25:38.308 --> 25:42.308
Well, our bomber says
it's over here.

26:12.341 --> 26:14.374
Wow.

26:14.441 --> 26:16.508
That guy
does not mess around.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.508
Right up against
a load-Bearing wall.

26:33.274 --> 26:35.841
Liquid nitrogen isn't available
at the corner store,

26:35.908 --> 26:39.775
But it is a standard part
of a bomb-Maker's workshop.

26:39.841 --> 26:42.341
It's also useful
for diffusing explosives.

26:42.408 --> 26:45.575
On a well-Made bomb, you can
forget about cutting wires.

26:45.641 --> 26:47.474
Any decent bomb-Maker
will make sure

26:47.541 --> 26:51.808
That the important wires
are impossible to reach.

26:54.374 --> 26:56.675
Well, fi...
it's been real.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.042
Yes, it has.

27:01.074 --> 27:03.141
Freeze the detonator, though,

27:03.207 --> 27:05.374
And you can usually
remove it safely.

27:09.008 --> 27:11.207
Of course, "usually" is not
a word you want to hear

27:11.274 --> 27:12.908
When you're working
with explosives.

27:14.441 --> 27:16.374
I heard a beep.
Was that a beep?

27:16.441 --> 27:19.441
Get rid of it.
Get it behind something!

27:28.008 --> 27:31.341
Okay. False alarm.

27:31.408 --> 27:32.841
We're good.

27:39.008 --> 27:41.608
Oh, nice. Let's go.

27:54.908 --> 27:59.441
Ahh.
Smell that sea air?

27:59.508 --> 28:03.107
You miss that when you're
locked in a secret prison.

28:03.174 --> 28:05.274
It's the little things.

28:05.341 --> 28:07.274
Time to get out.

28:07.341 --> 28:08.908
Get out?

28:08.975 --> 28:12.241
You're planning to snatch a guy
who's bringing an armed team.

28:12.308 --> 28:13.975
We should be scouting
the site.

28:14.042 --> 28:16.008
I've hired my own team.

28:16.074 --> 28:18.274
I'm gonna put them
in place now, in fact.

28:18.341 --> 28:20.341
Thank you for your offer.
I'll be fine.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.341
You just be at the government
building with management,

28:22.408 --> 28:23.908
6:00.

28:25.207 --> 28:27.341
I said, "get out."

28:27.408 --> 28:28.641
Simon, this doesn't
make any sense.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.408
You keep me with you,
we can do this right.

28:30.474 --> 28:32.408
Ah, you don't think
I know what you're doing?

28:32.474 --> 28:35.675
You want to keep me here
so you can contact your friends

28:35.741 --> 28:37.008
And try to find
a way out of this.

28:37.074 --> 28:38.474
Not gonna happen.

28:40.107 --> 28:41.541
You don't want to do this?

28:41.608 --> 28:44.074
Fine. Walk away.

28:44.141 --> 28:45.841
Shoot me.

28:45.908 --> 28:48.374
We don't have to
do this my way.

28:48.441 --> 28:51.274
My way, however,
is the only way

28:51.341 --> 28:53.408
That doesn't involve the deaths
of thousands of people.

28:55.808 --> 28:56.741
Your call.

29:00.207 --> 29:03.074
I'll see you at 6:00.

29:03.141 --> 29:05.308
Don't look so glum,
Michael.

29:05.374 --> 29:09.374
Remember, if this goes right,
everybody wins.

29:09.441 --> 29:10.942
Call your friends.

29:11.008 --> 29:12.942
Here.

29:13.008 --> 29:16.207
I'll see you soon.

29:24.942 --> 29:26.441
Sam.

29:26.508 --> 29:29.207
Jesus, Mikey, there you are.
I've been calling and calling.

29:29.274 --> 29:30.741
What happened?

29:30.808 --> 29:32.741
Well, it was a little messy,
but we dealt with the bomb.

29:32.808 --> 29:34.042
We're clear.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.942
Yeah, we're a lot
of things, Sam,

29:36.008 --> 29:38.942
But "clear"
isn't one of them.

29:44.441 --> 29:46.508
Thank you.

29:49.308 --> 29:51.875
We just got some more news.

29:51.942 --> 29:54.841
There was an explosion
in a hotel in Miami beach.

29:54.908 --> 29:56.708
And you think
Michael did that?

29:56.775 --> 29:58.608
You're damn right
I think it was Michael.

29:58.675 --> 30:01.274
Why would he want
to do that?

30:01.341 --> 30:03.775
You tell me why your son
would want to blow up a hotel.

30:03.841 --> 30:06.474
He would never do that! "He
would never do that." He did!

30:06.541 --> 30:07.841
Look at the file!

30:07.908 --> 30:09.708
You saw it already!
Everything's there!

30:09.775 --> 30:10.975
It's documented!

30:11.042 --> 30:13.207
And these are all lies!

30:13.274 --> 30:15.441
I saw it
with my own eyes!

30:15.508 --> 30:19.341
I saw your son attack
a police officer, mrs. Westen!

30:19.408 --> 30:20.541
He nearly killed the man!

30:20.608 --> 30:24.341
Your son shot at me!
He tried to kill me!

30:24.408 --> 30:25.975
You live in a fantasy world,
lady!

30:26.042 --> 30:28.675
You have no idea
who your own son really is!

30:28.741 --> 30:30.741
I know this -

30:30.808 --> 30:32.841
If Michael
wanted to kill you...

30:32.908 --> 30:34.441
you'd be dead.

30:35.808 --> 30:38.708
I know exactly
who my son is!

30:38.775 --> 30:40.441
Now, back off!

30:40.508 --> 30:43.207
Last chance, mrs. Westen.

30:43.274 --> 30:46.508
Do you really want to pay
for your son's mistakes?

30:48.441 --> 30:49.541
He paid for mine.

30:49.608 --> 30:51.374
You are under arrest.

30:51.441 --> 30:53.474
All right, get up.
Put your hands behind your back.

30:53.541 --> 30:56.141
Up now!

31:08.947 --> 31:10.913
That's the government
building.

31:10.980 --> 31:12.813
That's where Simon
wants management.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.780
It's pretty open down there,
which means you got two teams

31:15.847 --> 31:18.080
Shooting it out in traffic -
Perfect.

31:18.147 --> 31:19.880
We got the bomb.
He's lost his leverage.

31:19.947 --> 31:21.080
We should shoot
the bastard.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.680
Yeah, if he shows himself,

31:22.746 --> 31:24.613
That's exactly
what we should do.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.047
All righty, then.
It's that kind of thing?

31:27.114 --> 31:29.913
Yeah. It's definitely
that kind of thing.

31:29.980 --> 31:32.613
I need to go meet management
at his landing site.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.581
You're going in
alone, unarmed?

31:34.646 --> 31:37.214
Management wants
to do it his way, Fi.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.047
He wants his team
to do all the shooting.

31:39.114 --> 31:40.547
I'm just there to make sure
Simon shows up.

31:40.613 --> 31:42.581
Do you have any idea
where Simon is?

31:42.646 --> 31:44.380
Probably set up a few miles away
in an armored truck.

31:44.447 --> 31:45.581
I mean,
that's what I would do.

31:45.646 --> 31:47.481
Well, we'll back you up
the best we can.

31:47.547 --> 31:50.147
Thank you.

32:19.547 --> 32:21.780
To be a spy,
you need physical fitness,

32:21.847 --> 32:23.314
A facility with languages,

32:23.380 --> 32:24.947
A tolerance for exotic foods

32:25.013 --> 32:27.180
And the bugs
that come with them.

32:27.247 --> 32:29.746
But, ultimately, there's
no greater qualification

32:29.813 --> 32:31.746
Than the ability to look
someone who ruined your life

32:31.813 --> 32:33.247
In the eye...

32:33.314 --> 32:36.481
and say, "let's work together."

32:52.347 --> 32:54.114
Right on time.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.780
When it comes to Simon, I don't
take chances. Where is he?

32:56.847 --> 32:59.147
I'm assuming he's planning on
grabbing you down on the street.

32:59.214 --> 33:01.813
About that, let's be clear about
one thing before this begins.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.481
I might look like
a nice, old man,

33:03.547 --> 33:05.147
But I assure you, Michael,
I'm not.

33:05.214 --> 33:06.980
I'll remember that.
Do you have your guys in place?

33:07.047 --> 33:08.347
Down on the street
by the office.

33:08.414 --> 33:10.547
They've identified
Simon's team.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.481
They'll grab Simon as soon
as he shows his face.

33:12.547 --> 33:15.447
Simon's team? Already?
Locals, apparently.

33:15.514 --> 33:17.947
They'll be eliminated as soon
as the attraction starts.

33:18.013 --> 33:19.880
Simon paid $10 million
to break out of prison.

33:19.947 --> 33:22.080
He hired an amateur team?

33:22.147 --> 33:23.780
Whatever tricks Simon
has planned down there,

33:23.847 --> 33:25.514
We have more than enough
firepower to take care of it.

33:25.581 --> 33:27.780
How many helipads
in the area?

33:27.847 --> 33:29.314
Helipads?
Just the one.

33:30.646 --> 33:32.746
Just the one?

33:32.813 --> 33:34.947
He knew where
you were going to land!

33:57.613 --> 34:00.447
Guess I was wrong about
that "everybody wins" thing.

34:00.514 --> 34:02.280
Don't be disappointed.

34:02.347 --> 34:03.447
You'll get
your reputation back.

34:03.514 --> 34:04.780
Of course, you'll be dead.

34:04.847 --> 34:07.414
Better late than never.

34:07.481 --> 34:10.447
I guess your new little pet
didn't work out so well.

34:38.679 --> 34:40.214
Time to go,
you son of a bitch.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.047
What the hell happened?

34:42.114 --> 34:43.612
Uh, I don't know!

34:43.679 --> 34:45.746
I just came out here,
and the chopper was on fire!

34:45.813 --> 34:48.047
This guy's hurt.
I'm gonna take him downstairs.

34:48.114 --> 34:52.080
I need all units
to the roof now!

34:52.147 --> 34:53.612
Come on, Mikey, answer.

34:59.980 --> 35:01.414
Sam.

35:01.481 --> 35:03.780
Mike, what happened
up there?

35:03.847 --> 35:05.646
Things didn't go
quite as planned.

35:05.713 --> 35:06.880
Yeah, no kidding.

35:06.947 --> 35:08.780
Look, we're down
on the street, south side.

35:08.847 --> 35:10.080
Can you get down here?

35:10.147 --> 35:11.813
I'm working on it!

35:11.880 --> 35:14.880
There's no trick to getting
down off a building quickly.

35:14.947 --> 35:18.447
Gravity will take care
of that for you.

35:18.514 --> 35:20.713
The challenge is getting down
without breaking your neck.

35:27.047 --> 35:28.314
Mike, what the hell
is going on?

35:28.380 --> 35:30.880
Simon got away.
He's with management.

35:30.947 --> 35:34.047
He's wearing
a blue security uniform, and -

35:35.813 --> 35:37.347
There, there!
By the ambulance!

35:40.380 --> 35:42.880
You call the FBI.
You tell them where I am.

35:42.947 --> 35:45.481
I'm taking this truck.
You make sure they follow me.

35:45.547 --> 35:47.180
No! We talked about this.
We're in this together.

35:47.247 --> 35:48.214
The feds are gonna be
all over me.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.380
We are going with you.

35:49.447 --> 35:51.847
You can't follow me
this time, Fi.

35:51.913 --> 35:53.147
I got to do this one
on my own.

35:53.214 --> 35:54.247
Fi...

38:11.380 --> 38:13.147
Michael, don't!

38:13.214 --> 38:14.514
Let us take care of him.

38:14.581 --> 38:16.214
You had your chance.
I saw how well that went.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.713
Michael!

38:17.780 --> 38:20.114
Shooting an unarmed man
with the FBI about to arrive

38:20.180 --> 38:22.947
Will put a big dent
in your future.

38:23.013 --> 38:25.347
And you have
a big future.

38:28.780 --> 38:31.080
I should leave.

38:31.147 --> 38:32.347
See you soon.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.680
Are you kidding me?!

38:37.746 --> 38:39.646
You're gonna listen
to the old man?

38:44.414 --> 38:47.247
4.75 pounds of pressure
on that trigger...

38:47.314 --> 38:49.047
this all ends.

38:49.114 --> 38:51.147
Come on!

38:51.214 --> 38:52.380
Put the gun down!

38:53.746 --> 38:56.713
Do it now!

38:58.447 --> 39:00.180
I will blow your head off!
Put the gun down!

39:08.847 --> 39:10.280
Oh, he owns you now, boy.

39:10.347 --> 39:11.847
Get on your stomachs!

39:13.447 --> 39:14.547
It's just
a matter of time...

39:14.613 --> 39:17.280
until you're just like me.

39:24.114 --> 39:25.481
Just like me.

39:26.780 --> 39:29.547
Just...like...me.

39:36.787 --> 39:39.854
I've been sitting here
for hours.

39:39.921 --> 39:41.421
Yes, you have.

39:41.488 --> 39:43.787
So, you gonna charge me
with something?

39:43.854 --> 39:46.787
Me? No.

39:46.854 --> 39:48.121
I'm off the case.

39:49.555 --> 39:50.987
What are you
talking about?

39:51.054 --> 39:52.720
I'm off the case.

39:52.787 --> 39:53.954
Where's my son?

39:54.021 --> 39:56.121
Honestly, I have no idea.

39:56.188 --> 39:58.921
We had him in custody
for about 20 minutes,

39:58.987 --> 40:00.555
And then he was taken away.

40:00.620 --> 40:02.954
He was here?
You had him here?

40:03.021 --> 40:05.654
That's right, and god only knows
what hole he's in now.

40:24.620 --> 40:26.587
What's that supposed to mean?
He just disappeared?

40:26.654 --> 40:28.021
Pretty much.

40:28.088 --> 40:30.321
I mean, before, I could've gone
through official channels,

40:30.388 --> 40:32.620
But once someone
is removed from our custody,

40:32.687 --> 40:35.021
There is nothing
I can do.

40:35.088 --> 40:36.720
And that is your choice.

40:36.787 --> 40:38.887
You had him, and you
let somebody take him!

40:38.954 --> 40:41.188
You did! You let somebody
take him!

40:41.254 --> 40:45.288
You hit me all you want.
It won't change a thing.

40:45.354 --> 40:48.088
He is gone.

41:10.821 --> 41:12.221
You can go.

41:12.288 --> 41:14.421
How do I find my son?

41:14.488 --> 41:15.987
I have no idea.
