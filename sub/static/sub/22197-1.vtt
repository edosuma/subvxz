01:04.297 --> 01:06.665
It wasn't your fault.

01:06.667 --> 01:10.469
Don't listen to him,
he's just superstitious.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.440
That's a stupid thing
to say to a priest

01:14.442 --> 01:17.209
who came to perform
an exorcism, huh?

01:19.679 --> 01:22.247
That's a stupid
thing to say, period.

01:23.883 --> 01:27.986
Um, you should go now, before
they come to take the body.

01:40.133 --> 01:43.402
As far as I'm concerned,
you were never here.

01:43.803 --> 01:46.071
Not tonight at least, okay?

01:48.508 --> 01:50.876
And I want
to see you again.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.312
Um...

01:55.415 --> 01:58.517
Need to see you again.

02:01.988 --> 02:03.288
I'm sorry.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.827
I miscalculated.

02:14.033 --> 02:17.136
I don't know why
i used that word.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.275
Goodbye, Kayleigh.

02:45.398 --> 02:46.999
Colin?

02:49.569 --> 02:50.669
I'll see you.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.491
Jewel?

03:17.463 --> 03:18.397
Kayleigh?

03:27.707 --> 03:28.574
No!

03:54.167 --> 03:56.568
We made it.

03:56.970 --> 03:57.936
We did.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.607
- Did you ever
think that afternoon

04:01.609 --> 04:04.209
at my parent's place that we...

04:06.446 --> 04:08.981
I don't know what I thought.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.852
There was a lot to
digest that day.

04:16.122 --> 04:19.423
A lot of the things i
thought before were wrong.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.291
But...

04:22.228 --> 04:26.498
I'm happy to be
here with you, now.

04:28.968 --> 04:31.436
Maybe even bad things,

04:32.105 --> 04:35.240
terrible things,
happen for a reason.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.479
I really want to believe that.

04:42.048 --> 04:45.150
- I used to think everything
happened for a reason.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.285
I didn't.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.856
I don't think I ever
believed that until Jewel.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.025
Until us.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.863
I know.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.966
Too much deep talk
for the occasion.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.467
I'll shut up.

05:03.236 --> 05:09.007
Happy honeymoon, my
soon-to-be-famous novelist husband.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.843
Happy honeymoon, baby.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.349
What's wrong?

05:56.923 --> 05:58.156
Kayleigh?

05:59.126 --> 06:00.792
May I join you?

06:04.264 --> 06:05.163
Kayleigh?

06:05.165 --> 06:06.098
Baby?

06:06.100 --> 06:07.699
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:09.836 --> 06:10.936
It's okay.

06:12.572 --> 06:15.006
You're okay.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.273
Jewely, no.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.808
Bubbles!

06:51.277 --> 06:52.577
Now you're playing with fire,

06:52.579 --> 06:54.079
dripping on mommy's magazine.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.247
Look at this.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.121
I know, I never get
tired of it either.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.598
Here it is.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.066
Ugh.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.802
Why didn't you just let me read
it on the iPad this morning?

07:16.804 --> 07:19.571
- Well, that would have
been unceremonious.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.072
That much is true.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.446
Cool.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.084
It's a good review.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.352
It better be.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.190
- Oh,
you're gonna like this.

07:38.192 --> 07:39.257
I'm reading it too.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.326
Well then read faster.

07:43.397 --> 07:46.765
Oh, what time do
uh, Eddie and...

07:46.767 --> 07:48.500
Um, Lara.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.235
Laura's flight get in?

07:50.237 --> 07:52.170
No, not Laura.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.271
Lara.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.340
No u, it's hipper.

07:55.608 --> 07:56.708
Okay.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.510
Um...

07:59.345 --> 08:00.579
2:00 P.M.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.848
Okay.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.851
I'll drop Jewel over at
Ariel's before my class and

08:05.853 --> 08:07.252
I'll meet you all back here.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.887
Sounds good.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.423
- Come on
jewely, let's get dressed.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.428
Give your daddy a kiss.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.897
- Don't worry, daddy
will clean up your mess.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.967
- Say,
"thank you daddy."

08:32.678 --> 08:35.313
- People say that
god is a fiction,

08:35.780 --> 08:39.183
but a dangerous fiction
at that, nowadays.

08:39.751 --> 08:43.121
But the real danger
is his obverse.

08:43.589 --> 08:47.526
The very real father of evil,
the fallen one.

08:48.194 --> 08:52.197
In whose grasp the
world is now but...

08:53.032 --> 08:56.301
I suppose I'm
preachin' to the choir.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.371
Am I right, father hampstead?

08:59.839 --> 09:02.307
Um, well, yes.

09:02.408 --> 09:03.942
Thank you, mama.

09:06.579 --> 09:09.047
Um, tell me...

09:10.049 --> 09:13.218
How long has Jewel
been acting strangely?

09:15.021 --> 09:18.156
- Since we found her in
the woods with that boy.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.125
How long ago was that, mama?

09:20.127 --> 09:22.427
- Oh, that's hardly strange
behavior for a teenage girl.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.262
Especially Jewel.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.264
Well there she goes.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.467
See father, my Kayleigh
is about to graduate

09:29.469 --> 09:33.071
from a fancy private
school in New Orleans.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.640
With a degree in philosophy.

09:35.642 --> 09:38.410
Decidedly secular philosophy.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.745
What is that German
fella's name...

09:40.747 --> 09:42.480
daddy, don't start.

09:42.482 --> 09:45.283
You started it, darlin'.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.818
Individualism.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.053
Self-centeredness.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.621
Carnality.

09:49.922 --> 09:54.059
Now these things are the purview
of Satan, plain and simple.

09:55.094 --> 09:58.163
But, I am proud of my daughter.

09:59.065 --> 10:02.367
She saved me a whole
lot of money on school.

10:03.736 --> 10:06.371
I can only be a good steward.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.441
I cannot be the
master of their fates.

10:09.909 --> 10:12.277
But my secret fear of her...

10:13.579 --> 10:17.782
Is that I would lose both my
daughters to the adversary.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.184
To damnation.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.318
Good god...

10:25.091 --> 10:29.294
- May I ask, have you taken
Jewel to see a doctor?

10:30.763 --> 10:32.364
A medical doctor?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.333
Now why would I do that?

10:35.335 --> 10:37.402
Her malady is spiritual.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.704
- The church requires that
the individual be evaluated

10:39.706 --> 10:41.473
by a medical doctor
or psychiatrist

10:41.475 --> 10:43.975
before the rite
can be performed.

10:43.977 --> 10:44.843
Hmm.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.414
My daughter is not insane.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.417
She is infected.

11:02.495 --> 11:06.031
- So, kant's categorical
imperative effectively states

11:06.033 --> 11:09.234
that the only thing that
gives an action moral worth,

11:09.236 --> 11:13.371
moral value, is not its outcome,
but the motive behind it.

11:13.373 --> 11:17.108
So for kant, the road to
hell is in fact not paved

11:17.110 --> 11:21.312
with good intentions,
because intention is everything.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.450
Okay, that's all for today.

11:38.297 --> 11:40.131
- So the money they gave
me for the next movie

11:40.133 --> 11:43.501
is absolutely
fuckin' outrageous.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.603
I mean to be honest,
it's pretty terrifying.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.172
I mean...

11:47.174 --> 11:51.443
Does one hit movie really
justify $80 million dollars?

11:51.445 --> 11:53.311
I mean, is that really rational?

11:53.313 --> 11:54.345
No it's not.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.149
Alea iacta est, right?

11:58.151 --> 12:00.118
The die is cast.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.619
I bet that takes you back, eh?

12:02.956 --> 12:05.957
- Hey, you've made other
good films, commercials.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.525
It was time.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.194
- Yeah but,
not "torrent"...

12:09.196 --> 12:10.795
jeez, Eddie.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.263
Jackass.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.431
- Sorry babe,
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

12:13.433 --> 12:14.799
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Yep.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.836
- Um, yeah, but
not like 'torrent...

12:17.838 --> 12:19.604
That's a great title.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.673
And that was yours,
that was your novel.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.475
And I owe you, buddy.

12:24.844 --> 12:28.046
Give me a kiss, you
righteous bastard.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.649
- I was just
source material.

12:31.651 --> 12:32.817
I didn't even write
the screenplay.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.420
- Uh, the source
material is the movie.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.855
Story is everything.

12:36.857 --> 12:40.024
It's the, it's the Clay,
it's the carrara marble.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.526
Despite the fact
that the industry

12:41.528 --> 12:43.394
is fixated with spectacle,

12:43.396 --> 12:46.131
it all comes back to story.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.900
The character is
everything, dude.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.771
And that's what you brought,
the character, they're yours.

12:52.773 --> 12:56.407
So don't play the uh, false
humility card, it's unbecoming.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.878
It was unbecoming when
you were a priest.

13:02.648 --> 13:06.417
- Hey, how soon can I take my
clothes off and get in a pool?

13:06.419 --> 13:09.420
- Uh, you do have a
privacy fence, right?

13:09.422 --> 13:10.955
Plenty of Tequila?

13:12.324 --> 13:13.558
- Why the hell am i
carrying and loading your bags?

13:14.828 --> 13:17.762
- I don't know,
'cause I'm amazing?

13:19.298 --> 13:21.499
Don't start helping now.

13:27.540 --> 13:31.409
- I want to play
with you some more...

13:32.678 --> 13:33.912
Jewely?

13:52.698 --> 13:53.965
Hey babe.

13:54.533 --> 13:55.700
You okay?

13:55.702 --> 13:57.302
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:57.703 --> 13:58.970
What's up?

13:58.972 --> 14:02.974
- Can you pick up some pineapple
juice and jalapeÃ±os on the way home?

14:02.976 --> 14:04.108
Sure.

14:23.262 --> 14:26.030
I'm not one to judge, but um,

14:26.765 --> 14:29.467
what are the purple
streaks about?

14:31.537 --> 14:35.740
- She had 'em done as a uh,
tribute to prince when he died.

14:37.276 --> 14:39.777
I think it's fuckin' sexy.

14:39.779 --> 14:42.013
- Who knew high school
girls were into prince?

14:42.015 --> 14:45.250
- Hey, fuck you,
she's almost 25 now.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.318
Eh, that's, that's something.

14:47.419 --> 14:49.921
- I seem to recall that
there's a significant few years

14:49.923 --> 14:54.125
between you and your much
better half, you prick.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.560
All right.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.928
Kayleigh.

14:56.930 --> 15:00.064
Are you ready to
experience seÃ±or Eduardo's

15:00.066 --> 15:03.201
pineapple cilantro
jalapeÃ±o Margarita?

15:06.338 --> 15:07.572
Yeah, I'm coming out.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.806
I just have to put
my swimsuit on.

15:08.808 --> 15:11.209
Well, Lara didn't.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.243
Just saying.

15:13.612 --> 15:16.814
- How did I survive Ireland
hanging around you all the time?

15:17.249 --> 15:18.583
Really?

15:19.318 --> 15:21.052
The only reason you survived

15:21.054 --> 15:23.221
was my mentorship in debauchery.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.223
And a good few pints.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.392
God loves a drunk.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.493
Amen.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.628
In fact...

15:32.064 --> 15:34.465
I'm the reason that
you two got together.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.634
If I hadn't guided you
down that rocky path

15:36.636 --> 15:39.537
towards self-destruction, and
you hadn't reached the bottom,

15:39.539 --> 15:41.105
you'd never have
found the church,

15:41.107 --> 15:42.507
and you'd never have
performed that exorcism

15:42.509 --> 15:43.641
on her dead sister.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.176
Eddie...

15:46.679 --> 15:49.213
Sorry, was that insensitive?

15:51.016 --> 15:53.518
I, I, I have no filter.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.021
I, I'm the world's biggest
prick, I'm so sorry.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.056
It's fine.

16:03.162 --> 16:06.864
- You better go make
sure Lara doesn't burn.

16:07.766 --> 16:10.335
Sun's a lot hotter down here.

16:10.936 --> 16:12.637
Good idea.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.509
Hey...

16:19.478 --> 16:20.712
You okay?

16:20.714 --> 16:23.448
- Yeah, I'm gonna
go get my suit on.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.882
Come here.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.519
Are you okay?

16:29.655 --> 16:33.825
- Yeah, I was just thinking
about the chain of causation.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.861
Responsibility.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.896
Moral responsibility.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.465
A person may appear
on the surface

16:40.467 --> 16:42.667
to be entirely responsible
for a given act,

16:42.669 --> 16:46.537
but is in fact in no way
culpable and in theory,

16:46.539 --> 16:50.808
should suffer no legal or moral
repercussions as a result.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.510
I was responsible.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.613
It could have gone
a different way.

16:57.616 --> 16:58.983
Didn't you hear?

16:58.985 --> 17:00.318
Maybe Eddie was.

17:01.253 --> 17:03.354
Causation is a...

17:03.455 --> 17:04.922
Precarious thing.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.333
Get it together, Kayleigh.

17:58.710 --> 18:03.214
- All right, so as it happened,
the barman was a priest.

18:03.216 --> 18:06.651
At this little uh, country
church outside Dublin.

18:06.653 --> 18:10.455
So these ulster jackasses,
and this father...

18:12.124 --> 18:13.724
Ah, what was his name, Mike?

18:13.726 --> 18:16.227
- Yep.
- Mike, yeah, Mike.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.728
And we're there most nights,

18:17.730 --> 18:20.398
and we're just getting shitfaced
and talking about history

18:20.400 --> 18:22.967
and theology and all the
important stuff, right?

18:22.969 --> 18:25.470
And at one point, Colin asks,

18:25.472 --> 18:27.171
"so how have you
managed to be a priest"

18:27.173 --> 18:28.840
"and a barman at the same time?"

18:28.842 --> 18:32.243
It's like uh, a priest is a
round-the-clock kind of job.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.913
And he's there
every single night.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.181
And he goes...

18:37.183 --> 18:40.284
- he says, "the
pub's my real church."

18:42.321 --> 18:45.323
"My... vocation",
it was beautiful.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.059
He said, "the church building",

18:48.061 --> 18:50.995
that's just where I go
to do my regular job."

18:50.997 --> 18:53.598
"So many lost souls, you know?"

18:55.167 --> 18:56.567
- Funny the two of
you wound up in the

18:56.569 --> 18:58.903
entertainment business.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.272
It's just so surface, you know?

19:03.009 --> 19:04.809
- I don't really
see myself as being

19:04.811 --> 19:06.043
in the entertainment business.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.245
Oh, piss off.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.779
Of course you are.

19:09.848 --> 19:12.817
Anyway, I studied art history,

19:12.819 --> 19:15.720
which is history
plus art, get it?

19:15.722 --> 19:18.356
- And you graduated from
that to car commercials

19:18.358 --> 19:20.291
and stoner comedies.

19:20.293 --> 19:23.594
- You know, she's pretty
insightful for a high school girl.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.997
- She's a bitchy little force
of nature is what she is.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.801
So how did you two meet again?

19:30.803 --> 19:32.503
Eddie was a frequent guest

19:32.505 --> 19:34.639
at the clinic where
i used to work.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.973
Mmhmm.

19:35.975 --> 19:40.278
Acupuncture, medical
marijuana, and beautiful women.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.480
What more could a man ask?

19:46.451 --> 19:47.552
Okay, baby.

19:48.987 --> 19:51.989
Jewely wants to
talk to her daddy.

19:51.991 --> 19:55.459
Ariel says she's been crying
ever since she got there.

19:55.461 --> 19:56.727
That's weird.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.997
Excuse me, guys.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.265
Hey sweet girl.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.103
What's the matter?

20:09.408 --> 20:10.942
She's burdened.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.376
What?

20:12.378 --> 20:15.846
- Kayleigh, there's
something attached to her.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.218
Let's not do this now, yeah?

20:24.523 --> 20:26.123
Emmie and Marcus just landed.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.325
- Mmhmm.
- Mmm.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.586
- Maybe you could give me a
few minutes alone with her?

20:57.422 --> 20:59.490
I am her father.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.192
I deserve to be here.

21:02.561 --> 21:05.630
- I'm not concerned with
what you deserve, Mr. Grant.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.566
Only what's best for
your daughter right now.

21:09.534 --> 21:11.936
Just listen to him, daddy.

21:11.938 --> 21:12.803
Please?

21:15.907 --> 21:18.909
- Look, I just need to
do a brief evaluation.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.278
It often helps if there
aren't people with

21:20.280 --> 21:22.480
personal connections
in the room.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.315
All right.

21:25.817 --> 21:27.518
Evaluate her.

21:28.320 --> 21:32.156
But do not proceed further
without talkin' to me.

21:32.658 --> 21:33.924
Yes, sir.

21:42.367 --> 21:45.369
- I'm going to pray
with your mother.

21:45.371 --> 21:48.773
I would ask if you'd
like to join us but,

21:48.775 --> 21:52.376
I'm afraid I know the answer
to that question already.

22:02.888 --> 22:05.356
What could praying hurt?

22:34.553 --> 22:35.419
Jewel?

22:36.955 --> 22:38.522
Can you hear me?

22:51.336 --> 22:55.639
Lord, may your mercy descend
upon us, upon Jewel Grant,

22:55.641 --> 22:58.142
at this moment, her
moment of greatest need.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.815
Have you come to save me...

23:05.650 --> 23:07.685
Or just to play with me?

23:28.440 --> 23:30.441
So what's the verdict?

23:30.443 --> 23:31.876
On the Margarita?

23:33.445 --> 23:34.745
It's nice.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.715
Sweet and hot at the same time.

23:37.717 --> 23:38.916
I like it.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.551
See?

23:40.553 --> 23:43.921
I'm really becoming quite
an excellent mixologist.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.458
Is anybody else coming in?

23:50.195 --> 23:51.362
Kayleigh?

23:52.030 --> 23:53.197
Come in.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.032
Why not?

24:32.337 --> 24:33.938
- Woo hoo!
- Uh huh!

24:36.242 --> 24:37.575
Yes!

24:38.610 --> 24:41.846
Hey there, naked girl.
- Hello!

24:41.848 --> 24:43.147
Hey.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.116
It's your wedding weekend.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.318
Oh girl, don't.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.752
Now, you see I'm
dressed, don't you?

24:48.754 --> 24:50.254
Now you know better than that.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.989
This place, it looks
like a spread from

24:51.991 --> 24:54.091
"the Southern
lifestyle", uh huh.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.960
Man, props hampsteads.

25:02.267 --> 25:04.969
- She's gonna wear clothes
at the wedding, right?

25:04.971 --> 25:06.537
Oh no, didn't I tell you?

25:06.539 --> 25:08.906
Uh no, we're both
gonna be naked.

25:11.377 --> 25:12.743
The look on your face!

25:12.745 --> 25:15.279
You're such a gullible fucker.

25:17.415 --> 25:18.616
Is this him?

25:23.622 --> 25:26.290
This is some dark-ass shit.

25:26.958 --> 25:28.726
It spoke to me.

25:28.728 --> 25:29.727
Thank you.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.329
- Oh, could you go
ahead and sign my copy

25:32.331 --> 25:34.431
so we can get that
awkward shit out the way?

25:34.966 --> 25:36.033
Sure.

25:39.170 --> 25:40.804
I'm Marcus, by the way.

25:45.176 --> 25:47.711
- In the blessed name of
our lord Jesus Christ,

25:47.713 --> 25:50.414
through whom all
things were created.

25:50.416 --> 25:51.315
Amen.

25:58.924 --> 26:02.126
You have evaluated our
daughter, I take it?

26:02.327 --> 26:03.661
Uh...

26:03.663 --> 26:04.762
Yes.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.404
But I'd like to get
a second opinion.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.675
I have a mentor,
a former teacher,

26:17.677 --> 26:19.743
who has a great deal more
experience in these matters

26:19.745 --> 26:20.945
than I do.

26:21.813 --> 26:22.680
Oh.

26:24.115 --> 26:27.651
I had thought you were an
expert in your own right.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.357
Well, um, look it's...

26:34.626 --> 26:37.394
It's very important for
your daughter's sake that

26:37.396 --> 26:40.798
we be sure about
what's going on here.

26:40.800 --> 26:41.999
Hmm.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.801
I can come back tomorrow.

26:44.936 --> 26:49.106
In the meantime, please,
please, call a doctor.

26:49.908 --> 26:50.941
We will.

26:52.377 --> 26:54.478
We'll see what we can do.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.183
Thank you.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.151
And father...

27:01.886 --> 27:05.589
I don't want to have to take
matters into my own hands.

27:05.591 --> 27:07.458
Please...

27:12.030 --> 27:12.896
Right.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.201
Well, I uh...

27:18.303 --> 27:20.337
I will see you tomorrow.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.777
- The hell
kind of priest is that?

27:31.549 --> 27:33.250
Father?

27:37.288 --> 27:38.522
What did he mean by that?

27:38.524 --> 27:40.724
Taking matters
into his own hands?

27:40.959 --> 27:42.660
My daddy can be...

27:43.495 --> 27:44.528
Unpredictable.

27:44.530 --> 27:45.729
What do you mean?

27:46.331 --> 27:47.765
I don't know.

27:47.767 --> 27:51.001
He and I haven't gotten along
in these last years but,

27:51.003 --> 27:54.071
I know he loves he
Jewel, in his own way.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.608
How'd she get the welts?

27:57.610 --> 27:59.543
The ones on her back?

27:59.545 --> 28:01.679
- Oh she had those
when I got here.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.614
Said her body was
punishing itself

28:03.616 --> 28:05.716
for the sin of carnality.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.688
Self-inflicted?

28:11.089 --> 28:12.623
- Well priests and
penitents have been known

28:12.625 --> 28:15.893
to mortify their own flesh
by whipping themselves, no?

28:16.361 --> 28:21.265
- So she did it to herself
before the possession?

28:21.267 --> 28:22.366
Or...

28:22.368 --> 28:24.268
do you really believe?

28:24.602 --> 28:25.803
In demons?

28:29.107 --> 28:30.441
Absolutely.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.525
Oh no, no, it's, it's, it's,

28:48.527 --> 28:53.063
I have it on great
authority that the ancients

28:53.065 --> 28:56.600
preferred a small
penis to a large penis.

28:56.602 --> 28:58.569
- Ooh!
- That's right, it's true.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.104
It's absolutely true.

29:00.106 --> 29:03.173
It's uh, that's why all the
Roman and the Greek statues

29:03.175 --> 29:05.375
have men with tiny,
little penises.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.010
- Those
with penises left?

29:07.012 --> 29:08.245
Uh, yes.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.780
- Short and they steal...
- The christians liked

29:09.782 --> 29:11.348
a small penis too, which is
why they took 'em all away.

29:12.785 --> 29:14.785
"Darling, look at that."

29:14.787 --> 29:16.587
"It's a lovely little
penis, let's have it."

29:21.326 --> 29:23.260
I, I gotta know.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.897
Tell me about the naked thing.

29:26.899 --> 29:27.931
When did it start?

29:27.933 --> 29:30.200
I mean, what's it about?

29:30.202 --> 29:32.836
- I don't know, I don't really
consider myself a nudist

29:32.838 --> 29:36.907
or a naturist or, subscribe
to any sort of label.

29:36.909 --> 29:39.843
I just really enjoy being naked.

29:40.679 --> 29:41.578
Me too.

29:44.048 --> 29:47.017
No, I reject the idea that

29:47.019 --> 29:51.321
any sort of shame should be
associated with the human body.

29:51.323 --> 29:56.393
It's just so puritanical and
damaging on so many levels.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.896
So, do you see yourself as

29:58.898 --> 30:02.199
exploiting a certain
societal taboo?

30:02.201 --> 30:03.634
No, not really.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.103
I wouldn't put it into
some sort of box like that.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.705
It's, it's not willful, really.

30:09.674 --> 30:14.745
I would just say that I give
myself the freedom to reject

30:14.747 --> 30:20.317
a conception of the human body
and human sexuality that's,

30:20.418 --> 30:22.186
that's steeped in
this twisted idea

30:22.188 --> 30:24.588
that the body is somehow evil.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.825
And that sexuality
is corruptive.

30:27.827 --> 30:31.862
And that we'll all just go
batshit and turn into these

30:31.864 --> 30:34.398
psycho, sex-crazed maniacs
when we see the body

30:34.400 --> 30:35.699
in its a pure form.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.502
Like, sex is a fact.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.171
It's not something
we should fear.

30:41.773 --> 30:44.107
I mean, it's just
a body, people.

30:44.109 --> 30:45.976
- Bitch just like to run
around with her titties out.

30:48.413 --> 30:50.214
Well that too, yes.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.084
I mean hey, if it feels good
and you're not hurting anyone,

30:54.086 --> 30:55.485
why the hell not?

30:55.487 --> 30:57.221
Life's too short.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.356
My little pagan baby.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.591
I love you.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.563
- Wise beyond her
years, and yours.

31:06.565 --> 31:09.533
How how old
did you say she was again?

31:09.535 --> 31:10.534
- See now you
want to be careful,

31:10.536 --> 31:12.002
she's gonna get onto the uh,

31:12.004 --> 31:13.871
reincarnation
chapter in a minute.

31:13.873 --> 31:15.038
- Oh, oh.
- Oh yeah, yeah.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.273
I'm game.

31:17.375 --> 31:21.311
- I'd like to propose a
toast, to Eddie and Lara.

31:21.313 --> 31:24.748
Eddie, may you not fuck
up my amazing friend,

31:24.750 --> 31:26.984
or Marcus and I will kill you.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.619
He's tougher than he looks.
- Mmhmm.

31:28.621 --> 31:29.553
This one?

31:29.555 --> 31:31.021
No, hell, she got superpowers.

31:31.023 --> 31:31.955
You don't need me.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.760
And may you both find a home,

31:38.596 --> 31:41.265
a sanctuary, in each other.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.701
Well put.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.236
To Eddie and Lara.

31:47.338 --> 31:49.106
Cheers!

32:01.719 --> 32:03.854
May I join you?

32:15.067 --> 32:17.200
Why is she bleeding?

32:17.869 --> 32:19.836
Jewel!
- It was suicide.

32:22.307 --> 32:24.074
Talk to me.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.277
What good does talking do?

32:27.279 --> 32:28.879
We've tried that.

32:28.881 --> 32:31.181
We've done so much talking.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.272
Take a little more time,

32:55.274 --> 32:57.341
present your findings
to the bishop.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.276
Let him decide.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.545
- I want to
know what you think.

33:02.347 --> 33:04.915
- I think she got
under your skin.

33:11.255 --> 33:14.591
- I don't know how
much time she has left.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.195
- You got
concerns about the father.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.431
- 80% of demoniacs
have suffered abuse,

33:21.433 --> 33:23.500
commonly sexual abuse.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.969
Apparently the infestation
was preceded by his

33:25.971 --> 33:28.572
finding her having sex
in the woods with a boy.

33:32.377 --> 33:35.012
- A challenge to
his control of her.

33:35.580 --> 33:36.913
Maybe.

33:38.383 --> 33:40.317
What about the sister?

33:40.319 --> 33:41.952
If he abused one girl,

33:41.954 --> 33:44.654
he most likely abused the other.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.424
She seems...

33:47.426 --> 33:50.093
Surprisingly normal, grounded.

33:50.095 --> 33:53.296
Although, she's been
away for a while.

33:55.299 --> 33:58.402
- Colin, you've been their
parish priest for three years.

33:58.404 --> 34:02.973
Did you notice anything unusual
before he made that request?

34:03.908 --> 34:08.110
- No, but, I think maybe
i wasn't paying attention.

34:10.248 --> 34:13.949
- Just make sure you're not
projecting your own situation

34:13.952 --> 34:15.284
onto this one.

34:19.389 --> 34:22.525
- Jasper Grant is
nothing like my father.

34:22.527 --> 34:23.592
Really?

34:25.362 --> 34:29.565
Remember, you ran all the
way to Ireland to get away?

34:41.212 --> 34:43.280
- You're
seeing her again?

34:43.282 --> 34:45.449
- I never stopped
seeing her, Colin.

34:45.451 --> 34:46.949
Don't pretend like you
haven't seen her too.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.386
Don't act like you don't
know exactly what this is.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.021
- I thought i
may have seen her, yes.

34:51.023 --> 34:54.357
- Oh, backpedaling looks
so sexy on you, Colin.

34:54.359 --> 34:55.292
Really.
- That's,

34:55.293 --> 34:56.659
that's not what I'm doing.

34:56.661 --> 35:00.263
Look, I'm just worried
about my wife, okay?

35:04.435 --> 35:08.472
- Oh, I am
so fucking embarrassed.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.108
Everybody has their shit.

35:11.110 --> 35:13.643
These people are our friends.

35:13.911 --> 35:16.513
- I barely know three
of the four of them.

35:16.515 --> 35:19.049
All they see is some psychotic
bitch they hardly know

35:19.051 --> 35:21.685
who dove randomly
screaming into the pool

35:21.687 --> 35:23.520
with her clothes on.

35:23.921 --> 35:25.989
I mean, what would you think?

35:26.491 --> 35:29.426
- I'm probably the
wrong person to ask.

35:31.629 --> 35:32.662
Hey.

35:33.431 --> 35:34.564
Look at me.

35:37.735 --> 35:38.869
I love you.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.771
I love you too.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.273
I'm just...

35:43.275 --> 35:45.809
Tired of carrying this around.

35:47.945 --> 35:49.746
Carrying what around?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.281
Oh, it's nothing.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.817
Um, we'll be down in a minute.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.887
That didn't look like nothing.

35:57.255 --> 36:01.391
- Lara, you're very kind to
come and check on Kayleigh but,

36:02.560 --> 36:04.995
this is something
that's between us.

36:05.463 --> 36:08.465
- What do you think your
sister wants from you?

36:09.667 --> 36:12.269
I'm um, claircognizant.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.671
I've always been able to
sense what's happening

36:14.673 --> 36:16.072
beyond the veil.

36:16.074 --> 36:19.442
And beyond the facade
that people put up to

36:19.444 --> 36:23.046
hide their interactions
with the other side.

36:23.048 --> 36:26.850
I can't see but, I know.

36:28.052 --> 36:30.587
I know your sister haunts you.

36:31.889 --> 36:34.991
Maybe haunts isn't
the right word.

36:35.426 --> 36:36.693
No, I...

36:37.728 --> 36:39.963
Think it's pretty appropriate.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.804
Are we expecting someone else?

36:51.609 --> 36:52.976
Mrs. Grant.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.545
We weren't expecting you.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.582
- I need to see my
daughter, please.

37:04.989 --> 37:06.223
Come here.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.258
How you doing?

37:27.545 --> 37:29.512
Afternoon, father.

37:29.514 --> 37:30.880
You're just in time
to meet Dr. Connor

37:30.882 --> 37:33.216
and hear what he has to say.

37:34.819 --> 37:35.885
Dr. Connor.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.087
Reverend.

37:37.688 --> 37:38.922
I'm glad you're here.

37:38.924 --> 37:39.990
Thank you.

37:39.992 --> 37:42.392
Well, enough pleasantries.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.593
Let's have it.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.030
- Jewel is, on the
surface, in fine health.

37:47.032 --> 37:50.500
Her heart rate is slightly
elevated, and she's dehydrated.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.602
She can't eat or drink.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.839
- Meaning, she can't
hold anything down?

37:55.841 --> 37:58.408
- Meaning she
cannot eat or drink.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.477
- Which is something
i suspected,

38:00.479 --> 38:02.212
so I put her on a drip
and I gave her something

38:02.214 --> 38:03.847
to calm her nerves.

38:04.982 --> 38:07.751
- She was coughing
up blood yesterday.

38:08.085 --> 38:10.320
That's unusual, right?

38:10.921 --> 38:14.057
- Yes, that would be
very unusual, right.

38:16.327 --> 38:18.995
- So, do you have some
medical explanation

38:18.997 --> 38:21.431
as to why a teenage girl
in seemingly fine health

38:21.433 --> 38:22.732
would be coughing up blood?

38:23.401 --> 38:25.068
Hand to god.

38:25.070 --> 38:28.104
How many times do
i have to say it?

38:28.106 --> 38:31.007
There is no medical explanation.

38:31.242 --> 38:34.944
My daughter's in the grip
of the master defiler.

38:34.946 --> 38:39.683
Now, will you help me rid my
baby girl of this evil or not?

38:44.522 --> 38:46.890
- Father,
do something please!

38:46.892 --> 38:48.591
Sweet lord Jesus!

38:49.960 --> 38:52.395
Go fuck yourself, priest!

38:52.397 --> 38:53.830
It speaks.

38:54.098 --> 38:55.932
Now do you believe, father?

38:55.934 --> 38:57.367
Somebody take him out of here.

38:57.369 --> 38:58.601
Daddy, please.

38:58.603 --> 39:01.371
- Don't put your
hand on me, girl.

39:02.874 --> 39:03.773
What is this?

39:03.775 --> 39:05.175
Why is she bleeding?

39:05.676 --> 39:09.713
- Demon, you will not
take my child then...

39:15.086 --> 39:17.320
darling, please...

39:19.291 --> 39:22.959
No thanks, darling.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.932
Why are you here, father?

39:29.934 --> 39:31.901
To purge me of evil?

39:36.974 --> 39:39.175
Each vessel...

39:39.543 --> 39:41.678
Has been corrupted.

39:42.613 --> 39:44.714
Each vessel...

39:45.449 --> 39:47.784
Has been overcome.

39:57.495 --> 39:58.762
Get away!

40:25.757 --> 40:27.624
She should rest now.

40:44.975 --> 40:46.276
- So that's
it, you're leaving?

40:46.278 --> 40:47.844
- I have to respect
the family's wishes.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.712
I don't have much of
a say in the matter.

40:50.047 --> 40:51.648
Look these are...

40:51.982 --> 40:54.517
These are very good,
very Christian people.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.353
Okay, I've know
them a long time.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.791
Jasper's helped me out in
more than one tight fix.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.093
Who am I to judge?

41:04.095 --> 41:06.262
I'm just a country doctor.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.231
You're their priest,
it's in your realm now.

41:08.233 --> 41:09.232
What?

41:12.770 --> 41:14.471
- It's possible that
Jewel is suffering

41:14.473 --> 41:16.673
from an ectopic pregnancy.

41:21.378 --> 41:24.280
An ectopic pregnancy is where
the embryo implants itself

41:24.282 --> 41:26.683
outside of the uterus.

41:26.685 --> 41:29.686
If that's what's going on then

41:29.688 --> 41:31.120
it's quite possible
that it could be

41:31.122 --> 41:33.156
causing Jewel's symptoms.

41:33.924 --> 41:35.792
It's quite possible?

41:40.231 --> 41:44.033
So, why didn't you share this
information with the grants?

41:44.035 --> 41:46.769
- Because I can't be sure
unless I do more tests,

41:46.771 --> 41:49.706
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna
put the grants through that.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.574
Besides, if the
pregnancy is ectopic,

41:51.576 --> 41:54.344
then it's likely the
fetus will abort itself,

41:54.346 --> 41:55.945
if it hasn't already.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.947
And kill Jewel in the process?

42:00.618 --> 42:03.553
- I suggest you do whatever
the grants are asking.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.055
God be with you, father.

42:31.348 --> 42:33.816
- I couldn't bring
myself just to call.

42:34.418 --> 42:36.486
You're all I have left now.

42:36.787 --> 42:39.789
I owed it to you to
tell you in person.

42:43.160 --> 42:46.996
- Colin, please tell our
guests what's going on but

42:46.998 --> 42:49.899
tell them that the wedding
will happen as scheduled.

42:51.035 --> 42:54.771
Honey, no one would blame you.

42:55.372 --> 42:57.173
- Just
tell them, baby.

42:57.175 --> 42:58.041
Please?

43:06.517 --> 43:08.484
He left this for you.

43:15.292 --> 43:19.796
<i>- He's made the very
emblem of honor, of salvation.</i>

43:19.798 --> 43:22.632
<i>Over and again, the
rich man is their own...</i>

43:25.236 --> 43:27.704
<i>What kind of crazy person
claims a filthy beggar</i>

43:27.706 --> 43:30.506
<i>is more honorable than that guy?</i>

43:30.508 --> 43:33.343
<i>More worthy of
attention and care?</i>

43:33.345 --> 43:36.145
<i>That's the really
subversive and of course</i>

43:36.147 --> 43:40.350
<i>really dangerous message
of what Jesus said,</i>

43:40.352 --> 43:43.419
<i>of your care, your
concern, your honor.</i>

43:43.421 --> 43:45.989
<i>To those who can't
care for themselves,</i>

43:45.991 --> 43:48.124
<i>and who have been
pushed to the fringes,</i>

43:48.126 --> 43:50.827
<i>even beyond the fringes
of polite society,</i>

43:50.829 --> 43:52.795
<i>who see real suffering,</i>

43:52.797 --> 43:57.100
<i>who've been repulsed,
reviled, and disheartened...</i>

43:59.436 --> 44:03.606
I probably haven't spoken to
you properly much of late.

44:03.608 --> 44:04.741
Forgive me.

44:07.011 --> 44:11.214
But I need your counsel
now, not for me, not for me.

44:12.883 --> 44:15.918
You know why this
is more difficult.

44:18.722 --> 44:20.423
I believe in evil...

44:22.359 --> 44:25.161
I just don't know what
kind of evil this is.

44:43.547 --> 44:45.581
What are you telling me?

45:11.575 --> 45:12.809
Hi.

45:14.244 --> 45:15.578
Come in.

45:27.958 --> 45:29.492
<i>Dear Kayleigh,</i>

45:29.494 --> 45:33.262
<i>I'm sorry I failed you and
your sister so completely.</i>

45:33.264 --> 45:35.832
<i>Although I am not worthy of it,</i>

45:35.834 --> 45:40.470
<i>I beg the forgiveness not
only of our lord Jesus Christ,</i>

45:40.472 --> 45:43.272
<i>but of you, my
precious daughter.</i>

45:44.842 --> 45:47.744
<i>Pray for my eternal soul.</i>

45:47.746 --> 45:49.378
<i>I love you dearly.</i>

45:49.380 --> 45:50.580
<i>Daddy.</i>

46:11.235 --> 46:12.635
This is a beautiful place

46:12.637 --> 46:15.571
that you and Colin have
built for yourselves.

46:15.573 --> 46:17.540
I've read about
what you've done,

46:17.542 --> 46:20.209
been doing, in magazines.

46:21.278 --> 46:23.312
You must stay so busy.

46:29.119 --> 46:31.921
Come home and help
me bury him...

46:36.226 --> 46:38.461
What was it Jesus said?

46:38.463 --> 46:40.830
That the dead bury the dead?

46:43.300 --> 46:45.601
Hung himself in the barn.

46:47.271 --> 46:48.805
Fuckin' hell.

46:52.576 --> 46:54.343
When did it happen?

46:55.946 --> 46:57.213
This morning.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.918
- So her mum drove from
Louisiana, same day?

47:05.255 --> 47:08.524
- Left as soon as they
picked up the body.

47:12.462 --> 47:13.696
Listen, col.

47:15.300 --> 47:19.502
I don't really know what
the fuck's going on here so,

47:20.904 --> 47:22.839
maybe we should just take our
little nuptials on the road

47:22.841 --> 47:24.974
and just get out of your hair?

47:27.611 --> 47:28.945
Kayleigh...

47:30.347 --> 47:33.883
Insists that the wedding
go on as planned.

47:37.054 --> 47:39.288
Is there something we can do?

47:41.124 --> 47:42.191
Uh...

47:43.794 --> 47:46.963
I think everyone just
needs to try to act normal.

47:53.237 --> 47:54.537
Say when.

47:56.173 --> 47:57.373
When.

48:10.320 --> 48:13.256
- Yeah, I only have
one wine glass.

48:19.529 --> 48:22.331
That's uh, an
interesting tattoo.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.800
Can't imagine your
father approves.

48:28.171 --> 48:29.305
Yeah...

48:29.307 --> 48:34.343
He accused me of defiling the temple
of the holy spirit and all that.

48:35.880 --> 48:36.913
Hmm.

48:36.915 --> 48:38.514
What does it mean?

48:39.049 --> 48:41.183
- The golden apples
of the hesperides

48:41.185 --> 48:45.221
were sought by basically
everybody in the ancient world.

48:45.223 --> 48:47.823
Regarded by the nymph
daughters of atlas,

48:47.825 --> 48:50.092
the sisters of the evening.

48:51.862 --> 48:53.729
Their father was
tricked by heracles,

48:53.731 --> 48:56.165
the so-called hero and,

48:56.233 --> 48:59.068
he stole the apples
from the sisters.

48:59.336 --> 49:02.571
For his own glory, to say
she had a lust for something

49:02.573 --> 49:05.708
that by right should
never have been his.

49:06.543 --> 49:10.746
And when he left them,
the sisters crumbled into dust.

49:13.850 --> 49:16.619
I learned about it
in a mythology class,

49:16.621 --> 49:18.754
the semester after Katrina.

49:18.756 --> 49:23.025
That storm took so much from
New Orleans, south Louisiana,

49:23.027 --> 49:24.360
and from us.

49:25.896 --> 49:29.899
But you know,
the nymphs, this place,

49:31.201 --> 49:35.805
me, when something
precious is taken from you,

49:35.807 --> 49:37.707
it leaves a permanent mark.

49:38.976 --> 49:41.177
It has to be acknowledged.

49:43.613 --> 49:44.680
Hmm.

49:51.054 --> 49:52.555
- I take
it you don't uh,

49:52.557 --> 49:55.691
have women over
for wine very often.

49:56.026 --> 49:57.827
What gave me away?

50:01.231 --> 50:06.168
The only reason I offered you
a glass is because this is...

50:06.170 --> 50:07.903
uncomfortable.

50:11.041 --> 50:13.776
- Actually I normally don't
see anyone at this hour

50:13.778 --> 50:14.910
unless I'm...

50:15.779 --> 50:19.115
Administering an
anointing of the sick,

50:20.083 --> 50:22.752
much less an
attractive young woman.

50:24.688 --> 50:27.056
What are you doing
here, Kayleigh?

50:28.725 --> 50:30.793
- What are you gonna
do about my sister?

50:30.795 --> 50:32.728
I mean, why aren't
you there now?

50:32.996 --> 50:34.463
Why aren't you?

50:36.099 --> 50:38.300
It was my daddy.

50:38.302 --> 50:39.869
What?

50:39.871 --> 50:41.237
The welts.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.139
He beat her.

50:43.141 --> 50:46.208
He beat the shit out
of her with his belt,

50:46.210 --> 50:48.577
when he found her with that boy.

50:48.979 --> 50:51.614
He cried like a baby
while he did it.

50:53.183 --> 50:56.652
He thought he'd beat the
sin right out of her.

50:57.487 --> 51:00.623
I think he honestly
believed he could.

51:02.626 --> 51:03.726
You saw it?

51:05.429 --> 51:08.831
- No, she called me after,
that's why I came home.

51:10.167 --> 51:12.535
- Tell me what
else he did to her.

51:13.503 --> 51:14.804
To both of you.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.407
What do you mean?

51:23.246 --> 51:25.448
Look, I know what's it like.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.084
My father was...

51:28.086 --> 51:29.652
A drunk.

51:29.654 --> 51:31.387
A bad drunk.

51:31.389 --> 51:35.591
Sometimes he'd have too
much, and he'd get violent.

51:36.993 --> 51:39.762
Sometimes in some
pretty twisted ways.

51:42.833 --> 51:46.502
But, you don't want
to hear about that.

51:46.870 --> 51:48.337
Yes I do.

51:51.007 --> 51:55.211
- Honestly, it was a lot worse
on my mom than it was on me.

51:56.580 --> 51:59.582
Didn't help that he
was the local sheriff.

52:00.484 --> 52:04.620
Said he'd lay down the law in
his house with his bare hands

52:04.622 --> 52:06.889
and anything he could
find to swing in 'em

52:06.891 --> 52:09.992
and he meant anything.

52:14.998 --> 52:16.298
I'm so sorry.

52:17.667 --> 52:18.968
Don't be.

52:20.103 --> 52:21.904
I think ultimately...

52:23.640 --> 52:26.942
It was because of him
that I turned to god.

52:29.012 --> 52:30.112
'Cause, uh...

52:32.015 --> 52:35.718
'Cause of him, I lost
all faith in humanity.

52:37.654 --> 52:39.622
Where is he now?

52:40.724 --> 52:43.325
His heart exploded one night.

52:48.298 --> 52:50.766
The widow-maker, they call it.

52:53.503 --> 52:55.838
It was gonna be
that or his liver.

52:56.673 --> 52:59.642
You can only rage
so long, until...

53:04.014 --> 53:09.752
I just wish, so much damage
hadn't been done, you know?

53:11.988 --> 53:15.558
Sometimes I can still
feel him, gnawing at me.

53:20.096 --> 53:23.899
I'm making this about me,
that's not my intention.

53:24.868 --> 53:26.969
Please, tell me.

53:28.672 --> 53:31.207
What else did Jasper
do to you and Jewel?

53:39.316 --> 53:40.549
Hey.

53:41.685 --> 53:42.885
Everything all right?

53:42.887 --> 53:44.920
- Yeah.
- Where's your mom?

53:45.555 --> 53:47.389
I got her a hotel.

53:47.757 --> 53:49.491
We've got plenty of room.

53:53.096 --> 53:54.530
I just thought...

53:56.900 --> 53:58.767
After what happened...

54:00.737 --> 54:02.004
I don't know.

54:13.950 --> 54:17.286
- Eddie, what do you
say we get wasted?

54:17.721 --> 54:21.690
- I would say, that's a
fucking brilliant idea.

54:25.696 --> 54:28.697
- So what made you want to
start a bed and breakfast?

54:29.165 --> 54:32.901
- Well I guess I've always
liked the idea of being a host.

54:33.536 --> 54:37.339
Of showing people
my idea of home.

54:37.540 --> 54:40.242
- Meaning, she's a bit
of a control freak.

54:40.710 --> 54:42.144
Hey...

54:42.712 --> 54:44.213
It's true.

54:44.215 --> 54:46.682
Well that's not a bad thing.

54:46.684 --> 54:47.783
So you say.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.151
And I'm right.

54:51.488 --> 54:52.888
Why Savannah?

54:52.890 --> 54:55.724
It's old, and near the water.

54:55.726 --> 54:58.327
And it's not south Louisiana.

54:58.329 --> 54:59.495
Hmm.

54:59.996 --> 55:02.164
It's a spirit-rich place,
that city.

55:05.136 --> 55:08.003
- It seems the spirits
approve the view, my darling.

55:08.005 --> 55:09.238
Is that what that meant?

55:09.240 --> 55:10.539
'Cause I, I wasn't sure.

55:12.209 --> 55:14.276
- You guys want
to take it inside?

55:14.278 --> 55:16.912
- Colin, it's just
an electrical storm.

55:16.914 --> 55:18.547
And it's beautiful.

55:21.184 --> 55:23.085
And I wanna dance.

55:23.087 --> 55:24.953
Do you wanna dance with me?

55:25.255 --> 55:26.488
Maybe.

55:26.890 --> 55:30.993
I'm gonna call Ariel and
check on Jewel first.

55:30.995 --> 55:32.361
Be right back.

55:33.063 --> 55:34.463
- Turn the music up
while you're in there.

55:34.465 --> 55:35.898
You got it.

55:40.170 --> 55:42.304
I'll dance with you.

55:42.306 --> 55:46.508
- Score, I got the hot
chick with the purple hair.

55:49.012 --> 55:51.513
Don't get too excited, Eddie.

55:51.515 --> 55:53.282
Did I say something?

55:53.284 --> 55:54.817
What did I say?

56:58.548 --> 57:01.216
- Well it's not a party 'til
some lesbian shit go down.

57:01.218 --> 57:02.718
Now look, I'm gonna go
ahead, i'mma tell ya,

57:02.720 --> 57:04.620
I don't do body shots.

57:16.866 --> 57:19.868
Kayleigh, I can help you.

57:24.107 --> 57:25.274
Oh, lord.

57:25.276 --> 57:27.242
What the fuck?

57:27.244 --> 57:28.777
Col?

57:28.779 --> 57:30.312
Check the breaker.

57:32.515 --> 57:34.249
Hey Eddie.

57:34.251 --> 57:36.852
Wanna go on a little adventure?

57:42.993 --> 57:44.126
Come in.

57:48.097 --> 57:49.398
Colin?

57:49.400 --> 57:50.466
Sir.

57:58.808 --> 58:01.076
I decided to move
forward with Jewel Grant,

58:01.078 --> 58:03.612
pending approval
of the archdiocese.

58:04.681 --> 58:06.748
Something changed your mind.

58:07.016 --> 58:08.650
- Yeah.
- What?

58:09.052 --> 58:10.986
Well, don't leave me hangin'.

58:12.455 --> 58:15.591
- Uh, the doctor's
findings I guess.

58:15.892 --> 58:16.725
Which were?

58:16.727 --> 58:18.594
Inconclusive.

58:18.596 --> 58:19.661
Sort of.

58:24.300 --> 58:27.169
- You still don't
believe she's possessed.

58:27.871 --> 58:31.039
- I believe something
terrible has happened to her.

58:31.474 --> 58:35.444
And, this may be the
only way to fix it.

58:39.415 --> 58:41.683
In a way I feel, doubly guilty.

58:41.685 --> 58:44.219
Not only was i
there when she died,

58:44.221 --> 58:48.724
I'm profiting from her
death, I wrote books,

58:48.892 --> 58:51.293
made all this money.

58:51.295 --> 58:54.296
- Welcome to the
entertainment industry, mate.

58:54.797 --> 58:57.299
- Kayleigh's really the
one who can't shake it.

58:57.301 --> 58:59.635
Especially this time of year.

58:59.637 --> 59:01.436
What time of year?

59:01.438 --> 59:03.672
- Tomorrow's her
sister's birthday.

59:03.940 --> 59:05.841
Oh, fuck.

59:06.276 --> 59:08.477
- I forgot myself, until
her mom said something.

59:08.479 --> 59:09.978
- Yeah, and I'm
the prick who poured salt

59:09.980 --> 59:11.413
into the wounds.

59:11.948 --> 59:13.615
It never goes away.

59:13.716 --> 59:15.417
Guess she's used it to by now.

59:15.419 --> 59:16.752
- Why didn't
she say something to me

59:16.754 --> 59:19.054
when I asked her about
the wedding here?

59:19.722 --> 59:21.056
- She doesn't want
to think of it.

59:21.058 --> 59:24.793
She thinks that gives
it power over her.

59:26.497 --> 59:29.264
- You are
some fucked up people.

59:31.067 --> 59:32.935
From my extensive
experiences as an electrician

59:32.937 --> 59:35.103
in the merchant Navy...

59:35.105 --> 59:36.772
priest.

59:36.774 --> 59:37.873
I can tell you that I know

59:37.875 --> 59:39.708
fuck all about electricity.

59:41.278 --> 59:42.477
What the fuck?

59:44.213 --> 59:45.914
You bring your friend down
into a creepy basement

59:45.916 --> 59:47.382
and then scare the
shit out of him?

59:47.384 --> 59:49.284
What's the matter with you?

59:51.521 --> 59:52.754
What?

59:53.690 --> 59:54.957
Nothing.

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.366
Let's go.

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:15.177
Hope it doesn't get nasty.

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:18.914
Power company's
doing what they can.

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:22.284
No estimate as to
when it'll be back on.

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:25.721
Great.

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:30.425
I was just uh, telling
everybody about the first time

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:32.094
I met your lovely wife.

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:33.095
Oh boy.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:38.000
No seriously, it was uh,

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:40.569
it was a pretty weird
situation 'cause,

01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:45.674
he was my priest friend,
and his girlfriend,

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.911
and she was smokin' hot.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.215
I mean, I guess she'd
have to be, right?

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:57.219
- Well, you don't give up
celibacy for an ugly person.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.087
That's deep.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:01.857
- You know, ugly people
need to get laid too.

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:02.658
Stop it.

01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:07.095
- I was really flattered
that he'd flown her

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:11.133
all the way to la to met
me and get my approval.

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:15.203
- I'm sure that
was his rationale.

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:16.938
- Sort of.
Yeah.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:21.810
- So um, we'd finished dinner
and were sitting around,

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:24.546
having this brilliant
conversation over several bottles

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:26.581
of really nice red wine,

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:30.352
and all of a sudden, do you
remember this, Kayleigh?

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.290
She just stopped in the
middle of a fuckin' sentence,

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:38.660
picked up half a bottle
of wine, tipped it up,

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:40.429
and chugged the whole thing.

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:42.497
Slammed it back down on the
table and I looked to Colin

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:46.568
and I went, "all right
buddy, permission granted."

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:52.007
I even forgave her
for being catatonic

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:53.408
for the rest of the night.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.981
You saw something that night.

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:04.619
You've been holding this
weight for a long time.

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:09.257
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:23.231
Please.

01:03:27.671 --> 01:03:29.771
Oh, fuck!

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.315
Shit.

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:23.959
What happened?

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:27.596
- Tell me
how you can help me.

01:04:27.598 --> 01:04:30.365
- You've come to a
moment of convergence.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.435
That's why everything is
crushing in on you right now.

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:37.339
You've become sort
of a wormhole,

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:40.475
connecting this realm to
the realm of the spirit.

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:44.012
Why would this be
happening to you right now?

01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:45.447
My sister...

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:48.016
Talk to me.

01:04:48.018 --> 01:04:51.152
- She would have
been 26 tomorrow.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.959
Today.

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.161
26.

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:03.665
Do you know anything
about numerology?

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.700
Not really.

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.803
The number 26...

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:13.375
- The numeric value
of the name of god in Hebrew.

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:19.881
- And, containing
the number six,

01:05:19.883 --> 01:05:22.817
god's diametrical opposition.

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:26.288
The number of
imbalance, of lack.

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:30.558
26 is the number of
the cosmic messenger,

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.728
of angels and powers
not of this plane,

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.731
who have something
to impart or need of

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:39.167
or connection to
this place and time,

01:05:39.169 --> 01:05:42.704
for the good or ill of those
of us who reside in it.

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:46.207
They're all, each
of them, emanations.

01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:49.544
They're the 26 dimensions
of ultimate reality.

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:52.380
From a singularity,

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.549
a divine mind,

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:55.951
god.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.121
Your sister will
never be closer to you

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:01.957
than she is right now.

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:05.226
Whatever it is that's
between you two,

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:06.895
now is the time to solve it.

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:09.831
You believe in god?

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.335
I believe in everything.

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:16.137
Is that the police?

01:06:21.111 --> 01:06:23.044
Do I smell of weed?

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:24.646
Is it legal here?

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:27.549
I'm gonna hide.

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:34.222
- Mr. hampstead, i
apologize for disturbing you,

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:38.193
but this woman says she's
a relative of yours?

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:41.363
Yes, you could say that.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:42.897
What's the trouble?

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:44.933
- This lightning storm's
kind of wreaked havoc

01:06:44.935 --> 01:06:46.267
around the area.

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:48.536
Power outages, as you know.

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:52.841
Big ol' oak tree got struck a
little piece down the road some

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:55.710
downed limbs are blocking
the thoroughfare.

01:06:55.712 --> 01:06:58.246
Found this young lady sitting
cross-legged in the street,

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:00.015
bawling her eyes out.

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.586
- Kayleigh gave me
directions to the hotel.

01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:07.555
I didn't know what
other route to take.

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:11.026
- You don't have
GPS on your phone?

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:15.730
Never mind,
we'll take care of her.

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:17.799
Thank you, sir.

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:24.139
Sir, is everything okay?

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:30.979
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:07:30.981 --> 01:07:32.647
My partner drove her car back.

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:35.150
It's parked right out
on the street there.

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:36.384
Thank you.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:37.519
Have a good night.

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:39.354
Y'all stay safe in there.

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:53.668
- Yeah, okay,
fine, fine, fine.

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:56.838
- Thought this was
in my realm now.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.474
- Couldn't bring
myself to stay away.

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:03.511
Had to come out and
check up on her.

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:04.779
Make sure she's comfortable.

01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:07.649
As comfortable as
can be expected.

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:12.253
But I sense I'm not
welcome here anymore.

01:08:19.694 --> 01:08:23.932
I care about that little
girl, father, both of them.

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:29.470
And you had better act quickly
if you want to save her life.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:31.573
Remember what I told you.

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:38.345
That, and malnourishment,
doesn't bode well.

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:57.332
What was that about?

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.401
What did he tell you?

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.037
I need to see your sister.

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:04.906
- Goddamn it,
what did he tell you?

01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:06.441
I deserve to know.

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:08.408
- You better
not let your father

01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:10.078
hear you blaspheme.

01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:13.448
- You think he
scares me anymore?

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.617
I think...

01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:20.587
You're not as hard
as you think you are.

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.799
- Your father
was a complicated man,

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:33.600
he kept me at arm's length.

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:35.036
Oh fuck off, mom.

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:37.538
Just take some responsibility
for once, for one time,

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:38.840
in your miserable life.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.707
Just admit your
share of the blame.

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:43.111
Your daughter died!

01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:45.479
Has that still not sunken in?

01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:48.383
For a multiplicity of reasons.

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:49.317
What?

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:51.386
What does that even mean?

01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:54.455
We failed her, all of us.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:58.026
Even you, father.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.097
Please don't call me that.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:08.903
- Dr. Connor said he
gave her something

01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:10.205
to make her more comfortable,

01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:11.973
but I don't think it's working.

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:34.329
Where's Mr. Grant?

01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:37.398
He's gotta work for a livin'.

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.669
When will he be home?

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:48.643
Kayleigh.

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:54.015
Would you grab my satchel
out of my car, please?

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:55.583
Yeah.

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:02.156
Now's as good a time as any.

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:32.620
I know it's been rough.

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:36.958
That's an
understatement, I'm sure.

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:40.862
But there's a way through this.

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:46.034
I'm here to help
you through this.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:57.011
How do you know Latin?

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.618
Fuck off!

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.886
You wanna play?

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:08.890
I'm good at playing.

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:13.728
Close the door.

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.332
You!

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:36.551
- In the name of Jesus
Christ our god and our lord,

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:37.919
by the strength and intercession

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:40.388
of the immaculate
virgin Mary, mother of god,

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:42.557
and blessed Michael
the archangel,

01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:45.293
and the apostles Peter and
Paul and all the saints,

01:12:45.295 --> 01:12:48.062
all powerful and holy
authority of our ministry,

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:51.599
we confidently undertake to
repulse the attacks and deceit

01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:53.735
of the devil!

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:13.488
I should do something.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:15.256
What you gonna do?

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:16.524
Bitch please.

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:19.394
You can't save every
living soul, okay?

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:21.396
- I am so
sorry this is happening

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:23.731
on your wedding weekend.

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:25.500
I'm not.

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:29.003
This is why I'm
supposed to be here.

01:13:29.005 --> 01:13:30.638
Not the wedding.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.640
No offense, love.

01:13:32.642 --> 01:13:33.941
Ugh.

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:37.879
I'm way too stoned
to be offended.

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.080
Yeah.

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:46.654
The uninhibited mind lies open
to the domain of the spirit.

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:51.893
- Can you say that again so
that it makes some sense?

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:58.299
- Native American vision
quests, ancient oracles,

01:13:58.301 --> 01:14:03.070
intoxicants, they're
all commonly used to

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:07.175
free the mind and bridge
the gap between worlds.

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.916
Kayleigh's drunk, and my guess
is drunker than she's been

01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:16.851
in a long time.

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:18.319
Her guard's down.

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:21.322
Oh.

01:14:23.893 --> 01:14:25.960
I understand completely.

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:31.065
I love you.

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:49.083
Oh, lord.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:04.866
Mama?

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.904
He started it.

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:13.174
- Well why in the hell
didn't you call me, woman?

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:15.409
My god!

01:15:36.398 --> 01:15:39.133
- What in the name
of holy god is going on?

01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:41.869
- I'm doing exactly
as you asked.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.504
Please give me some time.

01:15:43.506 --> 01:15:45.373
- I'm gonna be here
for my daughter.

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:46.974
Daddy, please!

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:55.950
- Oh sweet
Jesus, help us!

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:57.485
Let me out!

01:15:57.487 --> 01:15:59.186
Let me the fuck out!

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:03.157
- Is that you talkin',
or the demon?

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:04.492
Kayleigh, don't!

01:16:04.494 --> 01:16:06.761
Listen to me, jewely...

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:13.100
- We need something
to tie her down with.

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:15.870
You finish the exorcism.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.212
No, Jewel!

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:26.881
No, no, I wasn't...

01:16:43.565 --> 01:16:45.600
go ahead, daddy.

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:36.684
Jewel?

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:38.853
Oh come on...

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.190
Kayleigh?

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:46.327
Jewel!

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:00.641
I just want to know

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:02.610
why are you still
so angry with me?

01:18:02.612 --> 01:18:04.178
- Mrs. Grant, you
can't possibly not know

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.681
the answer to that question.

01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:08.549
I made some mistakes.

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:10.117
I was alone.

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:13.154
And now I'm more
alone than ever.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:17.792
Haven't you ever felt helpless?

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:38.879
Can you feel her?

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:43.617
She's here.

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:49.623
Maybe she's come to kill you.

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:52.259
Kayleigh baby, come on.

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.729
Let's go outside
and get some air.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:57.364
I'm fine right here.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.674
What's happening?

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:12.713
Take my hand.

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:16.350
Kayleigh, take my hand.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:21.722
Kayleigh, take my hand now.

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:25.359
It's okay.

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.554
May I join you?

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.428
Where are we going?

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:27.221
She'd come here
whenever she was upset.

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:29.623
We used to have horses.

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:32.893
She's always had an
affinity for animals.

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:36.197
Jewel?

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:38.632
Jewely?

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.413
Jewel!

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.251
Let us help you.

01:20:58.086 --> 01:21:01.155
- Finish the exorcism,
father hampstead.

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:20.834
Oh, Jewel...

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.527
You weren't here.

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:03.210
- Finish the
exorcism, father hampstead.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:09.016
There is no demon.

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:12.553
What did you say?

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.788
She's not possessed.

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.624
She's in terrible pain.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.863
She's been tortured,
beaten, raped, drugged.

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:27.267
She's had a psychotic break.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:31.271
Who wouldn't?

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:35.476
- Better stop talkin'
nonsense about my daughter.

01:23:35.478 --> 01:23:38.112
She just dove out a
second story window.

01:23:38.114 --> 01:23:40.014
- Adrenaline
is a powerful drug.

01:23:40.016 --> 01:23:42.116
Jasper, stop!

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:45.419
- She is and has been in
the grip of the devil.

01:23:45.421 --> 01:23:46.620
No!

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.058
It's you.

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:55.462
It's both of you.

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:14.114
No, please,

01:24:14.116 --> 01:24:17.084
I don't want to play
today, it hurts...

01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:20.254
I don't want to open it.

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:25.125
You don't have to.

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:28.062
You were there.

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:35.402
Mama, why?

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.509
Why?

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:49.817
Jewel...

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:53.887
Jewel, they're not worth it.

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:04.598
Daddy!

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:51.278
It mocks me.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.114
Don't be so surprised, Jasper.

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:57.518
She heard it all from you.

01:26:10.732 --> 01:26:12.065
No!

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:37.251
What are you gonna do?

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:50.731
I gotcha, Kayleigh.

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:53.100
I gotcha.

01:27:55.236 --> 01:27:57.738
Just, hold on.

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:00.007
No...

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.288
Goodbye, mama.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.968
She was coming to me.

01:28:29.871 --> 01:28:32.005
She was coming to me.

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.792
You are no man of god.

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:55.295
You're an instrument of evil.

01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:03.437
Precious daughter's
blood is on your hands.

01:29:03.439 --> 01:29:05.572
That means far less

01:29:06.307 --> 01:29:09.743
than the welfare of her soul,

01:29:10.211 --> 01:29:14.181
which if it descends
to the bowels of hell,

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:18.452
the very destination
the demon intended,

01:29:18.454 --> 01:29:21.955
well then, by
great heavenly god,

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:25.892
that too is on you, sir.

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:30.297
Help me, mama.

01:29:58.092 --> 01:29:59.893
What are you doing?

01:30:03.765 --> 01:30:06.566
- You may be the only
person in this world

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:09.035
who means anything right now.

01:30:45.373 --> 01:30:47.741
There's something missing.

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:55.782
Kayleigh!

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:57.184
Please forgive me!

01:30:57.186 --> 01:30:58.552
You're all I have!

01:30:58.554 --> 01:31:00.053
You're all I have!

01:31:00.055 --> 01:31:01.688
No, mom!

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:03.757
You have nothing!

01:31:03.759 --> 01:31:05.392
Nothing at all.

01:31:06.594 --> 01:31:09.763
You can stay here
tonight but I want you

01:31:09.765 --> 01:31:12.766
gone first thing in the morning.

01:31:12.768 --> 01:31:15.502
Please stay and talk to me.

01:31:15.504 --> 01:31:18.905
- Colin will show you to your
bedroom when you're ready.

01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:25.378
Goodbye, mama.

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:39.893
It was you.

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:46.066
The universe always
balances the scales.

01:31:57.578 --> 01:32:01.381
- I spoke with the bishop,
and for the record,

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:05.952
you decided not to
proceed with the exorcism.

01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:10.957
So that's what happened.

01:32:10.959 --> 01:32:15.595
- And, you were not at the
grants when the girl died.

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:20.967
- Because that's what's
best for the archdiocese?

01:32:20.969 --> 01:32:23.470
- It's what's best
for everybody.

01:32:23.472 --> 01:32:24.738
I think you know that.

01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.606
What about the grants?

01:32:26.974 --> 01:32:29.576
- The grants are just happy
it's been ruled an accident

01:32:29.578 --> 01:32:33.680
by both the sheriff's
department and the archdiocese.

01:32:33.682 --> 01:32:37.984
Based on your report,
smacks a bit like suicide or

01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:41.187
something even more sinister.

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:45.759
Yeah, maybe it was a suicide.

01:32:45.761 --> 01:32:50.130
Maybe, she'd been through
too much to go on.

01:32:50.132 --> 01:32:51.865
Maybe.

01:32:51.867 --> 01:32:54.634
And then there's the not
insignificant matter of Mr. Grant

01:32:54.636 --> 01:32:56.770
assaulting a priest.

01:32:58.006 --> 01:33:00.307
And that's important
to Mr. Grant that Jewel

01:33:00.309 --> 01:33:04.477
has a church funeral,
is buried within the church.

01:33:07.316 --> 01:33:11.418
Colin, you got into an
impossible situation.

01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:12.886
You tried.

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:15.555
That's all you can do.

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:18.592
I tried, and failed.

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:23.763
I was completely
out of my depth!

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:25.599
Aren't we all?

01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:27.801
No, that's not good enough.

01:33:28.135 --> 01:33:29.536
There has to be a reason.

01:33:29.538 --> 01:33:32.806
There has to be a consequence
for what happened.

01:33:32.808 --> 01:33:34.140
There will be.

01:33:34.142 --> 01:33:36.076
God will handle it.

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.746
Colin, listen to me.

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:43.416
You have something
special to offer.

01:33:43.418 --> 01:33:45.518
That is rare.

01:33:46.487 --> 01:33:48.254
Do you understand me?

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:52.258
She was pregnant.

01:33:56.797 --> 01:34:00.700
- Use your anger, use
your rage to do some good.

01:34:00.702 --> 01:34:02.268
You understand better than most

01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:06.840
what it means to overcome
impossible obstacles.

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:09.609
Honor her.

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:15.515
That's all you can do.

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:21.021
- It's not a
good time, Kayleigh.

01:34:21.023 --> 01:34:22.789
You should be with family now.

01:34:22.791 --> 01:34:24.190
Why?

01:34:24.392 --> 01:34:28.495
The only one of them that
mattered to me is dead.

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:34.834
What do you want?

01:34:34.836 --> 01:34:36.736
What do I want?

01:34:36.937 --> 01:34:38.972
My sister just died.

01:34:38.974 --> 01:34:42.042
My mother and father
may as well be dead.

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:45.178
And I'm...

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.547
So sorry...

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:49.716
I didn't do enough.

01:34:54.789 --> 01:34:57.991
- I need to
talk to the only priest

01:34:57.993 --> 01:35:00.860
that I feel
comfortable talking to.

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:05.198
- So you've come for
spiritual reasons.

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:08.134
I've come seeking peace.

01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:11.371
I need to understand.

01:35:13.574 --> 01:35:16.409
- Have you heard the
term trauma bonding?

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:19.179
That's what's happening here.

01:35:19.181 --> 01:35:21.381
We've been through a
difficult situation together.

01:35:21.383 --> 01:35:24.117
We share similar histories.

01:35:24.119 --> 01:35:27.153
- Hey, I went to
college, remember?

01:35:27.155 --> 01:35:28.455
Philosophy major?

01:35:28.457 --> 01:35:30.824
Psych 101 was a requirement.

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:35.228
- I have to be concerned
with the consequences

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:36.930
of my relationships.

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:41.801
Of my actions, especially now.

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:43.536
You're right.

01:35:43.804 --> 01:35:47.774
There must be a
consequence for all of this.

01:35:47.776 --> 01:35:51.311
But maybe the things
that haunt us both...

01:35:52.713 --> 01:35:57.917
That we share, were supposed
to bring us together.

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:00.553
At least right now.

01:36:00.555 --> 01:36:02.989
Maybe that was the intention.

01:36:02.991 --> 01:36:04.524
Whose intention?

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:07.060
I don't know.

01:36:07.062 --> 01:36:11.397
Maybe this god of
yours has a plan.

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:16.770
Kayleigh, please.

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:43.296
I never said goodbye.

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:47.901
I never even went
to the funeral.

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:51.404
I just ran to you.

01:36:57.111 --> 01:37:00.413
- Maybe she's giving
you another chance.

01:37:07.087 --> 01:37:09.956
Sometimes, they come to help.

01:37:14.628 --> 01:37:18.464
- It is with great happiness
in my pretty lil' soul

01:37:18.466 --> 01:37:22.502
that I pronounce you
now wife, and husband.

01:37:23.137 --> 01:37:26.005
You may now kiss
your hot-ass bride.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.129
- I have to confess, i
woefully underestimated you.

01:37:50.131 --> 01:37:51.998
And when you were lying
there by the pool,

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.034
naked with your
purple hair

01:37:55.036 --> 01:37:56.436
I thought...

01:37:56.438 --> 01:37:57.837
I know.

01:37:57.839 --> 01:37:59.038
I know things.

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:02.475
But you should know
better than anybody,

01:38:02.477 --> 01:38:05.979
things aren't always what
they seem on the surface.

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:11.217
- Bet you're ready for
that honeymoon, huh?

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:14.621
Greek islands, nude beaches.

01:38:14.623 --> 01:38:16.122
Yeah, it's kinda my thing.

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:22.762
You should probably
take that trip soon too.

01:38:25.099 --> 01:38:26.633
Yeah.

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:31.738
You have a beautiful family.

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:36.209
It doesn't matter how the two
of you got to this moment.

01:38:36.211 --> 01:38:38.077
Just that you're here.

01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:44.550
Thank you.

01:38:46.855 --> 01:38:49.389
Mmnmm, mmnmm, mmnmm.

01:38:49.391 --> 01:38:51.758
- Oh man,
it just went down my shirt.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.393
- Another one.
- - Okay.

01:38:53.395 --> 01:38:54.627
- Don't get too
drunk, you bastard.

01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:55.828
You have some business
to attend to later.

01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:57.864
That business is me.

01:38:58.165 --> 01:38:59.799
Ooh!

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:18.117
It's perfect.

01:39:25.359 --> 01:39:28.628
- Jewel, I want you
to meet your niece.

01:39:30.564 --> 01:39:32.131
This is Jewel.

01:39:40.407 --> 01:39:42.942
Come on, sweet girl.

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:46.946
Bye, jewely.

01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:56.489
That's it, I won again.

01:39:56.491 --> 01:39:58.524
Now you gotta go read
a book or something.

01:39:58.526 --> 01:39:59.959
I got stuff to do.

01:39:59.961 --> 01:40:03.129
- I want to play
with you some more.

01:40:03.131 --> 01:40:04.430
May I join you?

01:40:04.432 --> 01:40:05.999
You want to play with me?

01:40:06.001 --> 01:40:08.701
My sister doesn't
want to play no more.

01:40:08.703 --> 01:40:11.904
Oh, she's mean.

01:40:12.106 --> 01:40:14.307
I would love to play with you.

01:40:14.309 --> 01:40:15.408
But how about some other game?

01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:17.010
How about one inside, huh?

01:40:17.012 --> 01:40:19.212
- Yeah.
- Yeah, show me.

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:25.351
Where's daddy?

01:40:25.353 --> 01:40:27.020
- Off overseeing
the building of some

01:40:27.022 --> 01:40:29.055
shelter for the church.

01:40:29.057 --> 01:40:30.990
Said he'd be home late.

01:40:33.193 --> 01:40:35.395
What are you gonna do?

01:40:35.496 --> 01:40:37.230
- Kayleigh,
come play with us.

01:40:37.232 --> 01:40:40.666
- Yeah, Kayleigh, come
play with us, it'll be fun.

01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:46.039
Kayleigh doesn't
wanna play with us.

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:47.767
Mmm...
