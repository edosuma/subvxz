00:06.920 --> 00:08.558
Well, you got no place to go.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.469
Your problem is you brought
your queen out too fast.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.550
What do you think, she's a feminist
looking to get out of the house?

00:18.040 --> 00:23.160
No, the queen is old-fashioned.
Likes to stay home, cook.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.709
Take care of her man.
Make sure he feels good.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.592
Checkmate.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.873
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.399
Shut up!

00:57.560 --> 01:03.032
Shut up, you stupid mutt!

01:04.360 --> 01:06.749
You broke up with her
because she beat you at chess?

01:06.920 --> 01:07.909
That's pretty sick.

01:08.080 --> 01:11.470
I don't see how I could perform
sexually after something like that.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.513
I was completely emasculated.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.238
Anyway, it's not the only reason.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.675
-Yeah, what else?
-All right.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.400
You wanna know what
one of her favourite expressions is;

01:21.560 --> 01:23.471
"Happy, pappy?"

01:24.200 --> 01:25.713
"Happy, pappy?"
What does that mean?

01:25.880 --> 01:28.599
If she wants to know if I'm pleased
with something, she'll say;

01:28.760 --> 01:30.273
"Happy, pappy?"

01:31.200 --> 01:32.428
-Oh, you're pappy.
-I'm pappy.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.160
-Oh, I get it. I see.
-Yeah.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.035
-So that's not so bad.
-Come on. What, are you kidding?

01:38.200 --> 01:39.553
So tell her not to say it.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.958
I'm much more comfortable
criticizing people behind their backs.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.875
Look who's talking.
You just broke up with Melanie...

01:47.040 --> 01:49.076
...because she shushed you
while you watched TV.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.800
Hey, I got a real thing
about shushing.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.559
What is this?

01:54.720 --> 01:58.269
You ever get the feeling like you had
a haircut, but you didn't have one?

01:58.440 --> 02:00.715
I'm all itchy back here.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.835
-What?
-What is this?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.318
What are we doing?

02:09.759 --> 02:11.796
What in God's name are we doing?

02:11.960 --> 02:14.633
-What?
-Our lives.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.791
What kind of lives are these?

02:16.960 --> 02:21.670
-We're like children. We're not men.
-No, we're not. We're not men.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.593
We come up with all these stupid
reasons to break up with women.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.990
I know, I know. That's what I do.
That's what I do.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.238
Are we gonna be sitting here
when we're 60, like two idiots?

02:31.400 --> 02:33.789
We should be having dinner
with our sons when we're 60.

02:33.960 --> 02:38.078
-We're pathetic, you know that?
-Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.789
-Why can't I be normal?
-Yes, me too.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.235
I wanna be normal. Normal!

02:44.400 --> 02:46.516
It would be nice
to care about someone.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.717
Yes. Yes, care.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.270
You know who I think about a lot?

02:56.880 --> 02:59.394
Remember Susan,
the one that used to work for NBC?

02:59.560 --> 03:01.676
I thought she became a lesbian.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.632
No, it didn't take.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.757
Did I tell you I ran into her last week?
She looked great.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.309
You thought she was
good-looking, right?

03:11.480 --> 03:14.199
See, there you go again.
What is the difference what I think?

03:14.360 --> 03:17.238
-I was just curious.
-Well, this is it.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.470
I'm really gonna do something
about my life.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.438
I think I'm gonna call Melanie again.
So what if she shushed me?

03:22.600 --> 03:25.034
George, I am really
gonna make some changes.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.316
-Yes, changes.
-I'm serious about it.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.833
-Think I'm not?
-I'm not kidding.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.672
Me too.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.191
Melanie, you can shush me
at every opportunity.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.516
So we're all straightened out?

03:36.680 --> 03:38.591
You happy, pappy?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.115
Oh, it's just an expression.

03:43.960 --> 03:48.033
All right. That's very sweet of you.
Okay, I'll call you later. All right. Bye.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.395
Hey.

03:49.560 --> 03:54.918
Well, I had a very interesting lunch
with George Costanza today.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.877
-Really?
-We were talking about our lives...

03:57.040 --> 03:59.349
...and we both kind of realized...

03:59.520 --> 04:01.715
...we're kids. We're not men.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.997
So then you asked yourselves,
"lsn't there something more to life?"

04:05.160 --> 04:07.151
Yes, we did.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.390
Yeah. Well, let me clue you in
on something;

04:09.560 --> 04:10.834
There isn't.

04:14.680 --> 04:17.148
-There isn't?
-Absolutely not.

04:17.320 --> 04:20.869
I mean, what are you thinking
about, Jerry? Marriage? Family?

04:21.519 --> 04:23.829
-Well--
-They're prisons.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.151
Man-made prisons. You're doing time.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.550
You get up in the morning,
she's there.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.472
You go to sleep at night,
she's there.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.950
It's like you gotta ask permission
to use the bathroom.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.749
"ls it all right
if I use the bathroom now?"

04:39.040 --> 04:41.156
-Really?
-You can forget about watching TV...

04:41.320 --> 04:43.151
...while you're eating.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.039
-I can?
-Oh, yeah!

04:46.200 --> 04:49.351
You know why?
Because it's dinnertime.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.431
-And you know what you do at dinner?
-What?

04:51.760 --> 04:53.876
You talk about your day.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.109
"How was your day today?

04:55.280 --> 04:58.033
Did you have a good day or
a bad day? What kind of day was it?"

04:58.200 --> 05:01.033
"l don't know. How about you?
How was your day?"

05:01.480 --> 05:03.471
-Boy.
-It's sad, Jerry.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.358
It's a sad state of affairs.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.958
-I'm glad we had this talk.
-Oh, you have no idea.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.348
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.193
Three hours of sleep again last night.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.636
Three hours of sleep
because of that dog.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.195
-What dog?
-Why don't you call the police?

05:54.360 --> 05:57.397
-I did, Jerry. They won't do anything.
-Yeah. What dog?

05:57.560 --> 06:01.314
There is this dog in the courtyard
across from my bedroom window...

06:01.480 --> 06:03.869
...that never, ever stops barking.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.399
I lost my voice
just screaming at this thing.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.028
I can't sleep. I can't work.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.509
I mean, I just moved.
I can't move again.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.558
What am I gonna do? What?
What am I gonna do?

06:15.720 --> 06:19.190
-Well, there is something you can do.
-What? Kramer, I'll do anything.

06:19.360 --> 06:23.478
Well, what if there should be
an unfortunate accident?

06:25.560 --> 06:27.152
You're gonna rub out the dog?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.432
No, no. Not me.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.670
I just happen to know someone
who specializes...

06:32.840 --> 06:36.674
...in exactly these kinds
of sticky situations.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.032
What, you're considering this?

06:42.440 --> 06:45.512
Just meet with him. See what he has
to say. You got nothing to lose.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.793
I-- I don't really know why I'm here.
Kramer talked me into coming here...

06:52.960 --> 06:55.554
...but obviously I could never
really do anything.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.637
Of course.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.234
Obviously.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.438
Well, so anyway,
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.558
What kind of dog did you say it was?

07:08.760 --> 07:13.880
-I don't know. I've never really seen it.
-I see many dogs on my mail route.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.396
I'll bet there's not one type of mutt
or mongrel I haven't run across.

07:17.560 --> 07:21.109
If you ask me, they have no business
living amongst us. Vile, useless--

07:21.280 --> 07:23.794
Newman! Newman!

07:23.960 --> 07:25.473
Stop it.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.749
-Anyway.
-Yeah.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.432
Well, I was just curious...

07:31.600 --> 07:36.628
...if I were interested
in availing myself of your services...

07:36.800 --> 07:38.631
...what exactly would you do?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.235
Well, Elaine...

07:43.040 --> 07:46.191
...there's any number of things
that I could do.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.510
But I can promise you this, though;

07:48.680 --> 07:51.956
This vicious beast
will never bother you again.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.314
So, what's it gonna be?

07:54.160 --> 07:56.196
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.954
-I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
-Wait a minute. I got it.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.556
We'll kidnap it. We'll kidnap the dog,
we'll drop him off upstate.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.075
Then he won't bother you anymore
and he won't get hurt.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.549
Yeah, I suppose.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.878
I'd have to think about it.
I doubt it, though. I'll let you know.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.076
Of course, take your time.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.629
I'll be here.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.551
All right. Let's do it.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.672
Excellent.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.591
Excellent.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.269
How come you eat your peas
one at a time?

09:28.440 --> 09:30.556
Well, what's the hurry?

09:39.360 --> 09:40.554
Who is it?

09:40.720 --> 09:42.597
-It's George.
-George?

09:44.600 --> 09:45.794
George, what is it?

09:48.080 --> 09:50.389
Will you marry me?

09:57.120 --> 10:00.271
-Hello?
-Ma, guess what?

10:00.440 --> 10:03.796
-Oh, my God.
-No, it's nothing bad.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.155
-I'm getting married!
-You what?

10:06.320 --> 10:10.029
-I'm getting married!
-Oh, my God. You're getting married?

10:10.200 --> 10:11.952
-Yes.
-Oh, I can't believe it.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.680
-Frank, come here.
-You come here.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.070
-Georgie's getting married.
-What?

10:17.240 --> 10:19.879
-Georgie's getting married!
-Get the hell out of here.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.359
-He's getting married?
-Yes.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.431
-To a woman?
-Of course a woman.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.749
What does she look like?

10:24.920 --> 10:26.148
I'm sure she's gorgeous.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.754
-What differences does it make?
-ls she pretty?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.672
Yes. What difference does to make?

10:30.840 --> 10:32.114
I'm just curious!

10:32.280 --> 10:34.510
-She's not pretty?
-Let me talk to her.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.908
She wants to talk to you.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.550
-Hello?
-Congratulations.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.757
I just want you to know
that I love your son very much.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.069
-You do?
-Yes.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.434
-Really?
-Yes.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.353
-May I ask why?
-Okay, let me talk to her.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.273
-Will you stop? I'm on the telephone.
-Can I talk to her, please?

11:03.520 --> 11:04.714
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.314
-What are you up to?
-Nothing.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.234
What's the rope for?

11:12.360 --> 11:14.954
Well, how do you like that?
I got rope.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.148
Well, I gotta go.

11:18.600 --> 11:21.068
-The dog. You're getting the dog!
-Kramer, where you going?

11:21.240 --> 11:24.676
-Out!
-Don't go. Kramer! Come back.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.195
I got great news!

11:29.080 --> 11:30.513
Well...

11:30.880 --> 11:32.791
...I did it.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.112
-Did what?
-I got engaged. I'm getting married.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.113
I asked Susan to marry me.
We're getting married this Christmas.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.397
-You're getting married?
-Yes!

11:43.800 --> 11:46.360
-Oh, my God!
-I asked her to get married.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.432
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.430
And do you know why?

11:52.600 --> 11:54.670
It's because of that talk we had.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.957
You were my inspiration.
Do you believe it? You.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.429
That lunch was the defining moment
of my life.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.749
-I'm blown away!
-Are you blown?

12:03.920 --> 12:05.797
-Blown!
-You like that?

12:05.960 --> 12:08.394
-And she said yes?
-Well...

12:08.560 --> 12:11.632
...it took a couple hours of convincing,
but I was persistent.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.268
I was just like those guys
in the movies, and it worked.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.079
She said yes.
I can't believe my luck...

12:17.240 --> 12:20.915
...that she was still available,
a beautiful woman like that.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.991
You think she's good-looking, right?

12:23.480 --> 12:25.038
You're gonna have gorgeous kids.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.395
She's got great skin.
She's got a rosy glow.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.755
-A pinkish hue?
-Oh, she's got the hue.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.833
So, what's going on with Melanie?
I know you're not getting married...

12:36.000 --> 12:38.309
-...but things are happening?
-Well...

12:38.480 --> 12:42.314
...actually, we kind of broke up.

12:42.760 --> 12:43.795
You what?

12:44.080 --> 12:46.833
Well, we were having dinner,
and she's got the strangest habit.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.878
She eats her peas one at a time.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.192
You've never seen anything like it.
It takes her an hour to finish them.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.873
We've had dinner other times.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.635
I've seen her eat corn niblets,
but she scooped them.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.638
-She scooped the niblets?
-Yes.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.314
That's what was so vexing.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.791
-What about the pact?
-What?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.439
What happened to the pact?

13:15.600 --> 13:17.636
We were gonna change.
We shook hands on a pact.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.631
Did you not shake my hand
on a pact?

13:19.800 --> 13:23.110
You stuck your hand out,
so I shook it.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.554
I don't know about a pact.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.029
Anyway, you should be happy.
You're engaged.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.599
You're getting married.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.149
Well, it's not that. I just-- You know,
I thought that we were both--

13:33.320 --> 13:35.276
You thought
I was gonna get married?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.476
Well, maybe not married, but--

13:37.640 --> 13:39.437
I mean, you love Susan, right?

13:40.200 --> 13:41.713
Yeah.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.269
You wanna spend
the rest of your life with her.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.753
Yeah.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.118
So?

13:52.920 --> 13:54.638
Yeah.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.640
-This doesn't make any difference.
-No.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.832
-So we're still on to see Firestorm?
-Yeah.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.389
I'll pick you up at your apartment.
We'll go to the 8.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.399
-Yeah.
-Hey, wait a second. Wait a second!

14:08.320 --> 14:11.198
Celebrate!
How about some champagne?

14:11.360 --> 14:12.918
-Champagne?
-Yes, come on!

14:13.080 --> 14:14.957
How often do you get engaged?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.190
-Come on.
-Okay. All right.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.917
You know what?

14:27.360 --> 14:29.032
No champagne.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.156
Anyway, I'll see you later.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.509
Yeah.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.756
That's it. That's it.
Stop right here.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.480
How much is that doggie
In the window?

14:53.640 --> 14:55.278
Will you shut up?

14:55.440 --> 14:57.237
Is that a new song?

14:57.400 --> 14:58.913
All right, give me the rope.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.832
What? What do you need
a rope for?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.514
-Look, I don't have time to explain.
-Oh, I don't know.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.352
I'm thinking
maybe we shouldn't do this.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.875
-I knew you'd back out.
-Are we doing a bad thing?

15:08.040 --> 15:11.749
Look, we drop the dog off in front
of somebody's house in the country.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.558
They find it and adopt it.

15:13.720 --> 15:17.679
Now the dog is prancing in the fields,
dancing and prancing.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.796
Fresh air, dandelions.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.110
We're doing this dog a huge favour.

15:22.960 --> 15:23.949
Yeah, yeah.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.640
-That's him.
-All right.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.789
I'm going in.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.431
Keep the motor running.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.549
Ready?

15:38.720 --> 15:41.792
-I don't really think I can go.
-Oh, how come?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.316
Well, I didn't really tell Susan
about it...

15:44.480 --> 15:47.392
...and she doesn't really
have anything else to do.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.788
She can come.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.358
Well, she doesn't
really wanna see Firestorm.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.794
She....

15:56.360 --> 15:59.193
She wants to see The Muted Heart.

16:00.840 --> 16:04.992
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glenn Close,
Sally Field. That should be good.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.993
-Yeah. I guess I'll see you later.
-Wait. We can share a cab.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.958
-They're playing at the same Cineplex.
-George, better get ready.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.113
I am ready.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.794
You're wearing that shirt?

16:20.800 --> 16:23.268
-Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
-Yeah.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.279
-What time you got?
-No, I don't wear a watch.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.593
-Well, what do you do?
-Well, I tell time by the sun.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.832
-How close do you get?
-Well, I can guess within an hour.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.955
Well, I can guess within the hour, and
I don't even have to look at the sun.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.518
What about at night?
What do you then?

16:41.680 --> 16:44.752
Well, night's tougher.
But it's only a couple of hours.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.559
-Okay, let's go. Move.
-You got it?

16:47.720 --> 16:49.756
What do you think?
Drive! Drive!

16:50.960 --> 16:52.439
Where is it? Where is it?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.473
This?

16:57.640 --> 17:00.108
-This is the dog?
-Yep.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.953
-But it's so small.
-Yeah, but he's a fighter.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.680
That can't be the dog.
You sure you got the right one?

17:05.839 --> 17:08.115
You said the second courtyard.
He was there.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.156
-How could that be it?
-Get him to bark.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.709
-Yeah, I'll know it if it barks.
-All right. Bark.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.029
-Bark!
-Bark!

17:14.200 --> 17:15.553
-Bark!
-Bark!

17:15.720 --> 17:16.914
-Bark!
-Bark!

17:18.440 --> 17:21.637
-Did you like it?
-Yes, it was very, very good.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.509
-Do you think he'll ever find her?
-Oh, I sure hope so.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.750
How about when Ford
jumped out of that plane...

17:28.920 --> 17:30.672
...and was shooting back
as he was falling?

17:30.840 --> 17:34.037
-What about the underwater escape?
-Oh, man.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.833
Let's put the radio on.
Maybe there's a news report about it.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.479
Let's dump it. I'm getting antsy.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.995
-Think we're far enough?
-We're nearly to Monticello.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.516
Yeah. I think this looks right.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.597
All right. Give me the dog.

17:53.080 --> 17:56.072
-Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
-There.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.509
Okay, boy. This is it.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.830
This is your new home.

18:03.480 --> 18:04.833
Let go. Let go of my shirt.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.231
Come on. Let go of my shirt!
This shirt is from Rudy's!

18:20.240 --> 18:22.117
-Hello.
-MSG's rerunning the Yankee game.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.474
-You watching?
-They are?

18:23.640 --> 18:27.679
George, are you coming to bed?
I taped Mad About You.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.552
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.914
What was that?

18:33.080 --> 18:35.469
-Nothing. I gotta go.
-Oh, Mattingly just singled.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.360
You know, it was very wrong of you
to back out on that deal.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.796
-I just shook your hand.
-That's a deal where I come from.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.632
We come from the same place.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.836
George, I'm starting it.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.036
I gotta go.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.834
Roxy, where have you been?

19:39.000 --> 19:42.436
We've been worried sick about you.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.952
What's this?

19:51.320 --> 19:54.676
No. No, it's impossible.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.355
It's impossible.

19:58.880 --> 20:02.031
I don't know how it happened.
We were practically in Monticello.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.510
I mean, how could that thing have
found its way back? There is no way.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.359
-Very strange.
-I know.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.193
So tell me, anyway,
who was the big mastermind?

20:11.360 --> 20:14.955
I can't, Jerry. I'm sworn to secrecy.

20:15.720 --> 20:20.236
All right. But then I can't tell you
the big news.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.631
News? What news?

20:23.800 --> 20:25.472
Sorry.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.598
What? What?

20:29.400 --> 20:31.391
All right, Elaine.
But this is beyond news.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.869
This is like Pearl Harbor
or the Kennedy assassination.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.031
It's, like, not even news,
it's total shock.

20:36.200 --> 20:40.239
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please,
please, please, please.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.593
George Costanza...

20:44.840 --> 20:46.193
Yeah?

20:46.360 --> 20:47.873
...is getting married!

20:48.760 --> 20:50.591
Get out!

20:57.040 --> 20:58.314
Hi.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.675
-You Cosmo Kramer?
-Yes. Yeah.

21:01.440 --> 21:04.079
-You recognize this piece of fabric?
-Yeah. Yeah, that's--

21:04.240 --> 21:05.593
What?

21:06.400 --> 21:07.389
Nothing.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.232
-You're under arrest.
-Arrest?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.994
I have a receipt for a rental car
with your signature...

21:12.160 --> 21:15.152
...including a report of some damage
to the rear seat.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.676
It seems as if the springs
were so compressed...

21:17.840 --> 21:20.877
-...that they collapsed the right side.
-Newman!

21:28.440 --> 21:30.829
What took you so long?

21:34.040 --> 21:37.112
-What do you think they'll do to us?
-Don't worry about a thing.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.192
In 20 minutes, that place
will be swarming with mailmen.

21:40.360 --> 21:43.875
We'll be back on the street
by lunch.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.352
I gotta make some changes.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.751
I'm not a woman. I'm a child.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.436
What kind of life is this?
