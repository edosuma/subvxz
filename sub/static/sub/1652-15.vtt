00:01.250 --> 00:04.370
I figured out a way to
make you worth my time.

00:04.371 --> 00:05.470
25%.

00:05.471 --> 00:06.770
Everything that you take off the street.

00:06.771 --> 00:08.536
It doesn't look like I have a choice.

00:08.537 --> 00:10.570
We got him.

00:10.571 --> 00:12.203
I don't want that on my conscience.

00:13.437 --> 00:14.570
You can't do this.

00:14.571 --> 00:16.136
The kid's right, man, not tonight.

00:16.137 --> 00:18.303
I'm not a home wrecker.

00:18.304 --> 00:19.703
What happened never happened.

00:19.704 --> 00:22.570
Congratulations, Atwater.
You just made Intelligence.

00:22.571 --> 00:24.104
- Can I ask why?
- You didn't make the cut?

00:24.105 --> 00:26.837
I don't tolerate in-house romance.

00:26.838 --> 00:29.536
Listen, you've got a
son, Charlie, with Annie.

00:29.537 --> 00:31.203
The deal was I take you in,

00:31.204 --> 00:33.370
- he stays out of Illinois.
- I will handle it.

00:33.371 --> 00:34.470
I got flushed down the toilet,

00:34.471 --> 00:35.870
so you could play cop.

00:35.871 --> 00:37.169
- You owe me.
- Sure.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.071
Good answer.

00:44.571 --> 00:46.970
You had every opportunity
to reach out to me.

00:46.971 --> 00:48.436
Every opportunity, you shut me out!

00:48.437 --> 00:49.436
- Stop!
- Erin!

00:49.437 --> 00:50.837
She's fine!

00:50.838 --> 00:51.937
She's fine.

00:51.938 --> 00:53.770
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

00:53.771 --> 00:56.236
You're gonna wish you'd
stayed out of Chicago, Charlie.

00:56.237 --> 00:57.470
No, what you're gonna wish

00:57.471 --> 00:59.937
is that I'd forgotten all about Sandoval.

00:59.938 --> 01:01.670
But I haven't, have I?

01:01.671 --> 01:03.603
You want to take me in? Let's go.

01:03.604 --> 01:05.536
I'm happy to tell everyone what happened,

01:05.537 --> 01:08.370
not five streets from here, if I recall.

01:08.371 --> 01:10.703
Or, hey, I got an idea.

01:10.704 --> 01:11.837
Instead of the past,

01:11.838 --> 01:15.470
why don't we focus on the future?

01:15.471 --> 01:16.770
Sure.

01:16.771 --> 01:18.203
What do you want? How much?

01:18.204 --> 01:20.570
More than you can afford on a cop's salary.

01:20.571 --> 01:23.704
I'm gonna need the old
Lindsay for this one.

01:26.638 --> 01:30.670
You're out of your mind.

01:30.671 --> 01:32.803
Really? You know, I played nice guy before

01:32.804 --> 01:35.037
and kept my mouth shut for you two.

01:35.038 --> 01:36.336
What did it get me?

01:36.337 --> 01:38.037
12 years wandering the wilderness

01:38.038 --> 01:40.004
while you got to play
cop and you raised my son!

01:40.005 --> 01:42.236
Don't touch her!

01:42.237 --> 01:44.136
Nah, not this time.

01:44.137 --> 01:48.536
I'm getting my payday, or I run my mouth.

01:48.537 --> 01:52.371
I need that today.

01:57.437 --> 01:58.803
Please, Erin.

01:58.804 --> 02:00.303
- Annie...
- Erin, please...

02:00.304 --> 02:03.070
Whatever he needs, just...

02:03.071 --> 02:06.037
Just give it to him.

02:06.038 --> 02:08.338
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

02:10.704 --> 02:12.737
Hank.

02:12.738 --> 02:14.770
You get paid when I get paid.

02:14.771 --> 02:16.937
I'm supposed to wait around,
take your word for it?

02:16.938 --> 02:18.370
That's right.

02:18.371 --> 02:20.370
- You try and screw me...
- You already told me already.

02:20.371 --> 02:22.536
You got bear traps set up. Well, so do I.

02:22.537 --> 02:25.870
What's it called...
mutually assured destruction?

02:25.871 --> 02:27.770
How about we avoid all that?

02:27.771 --> 02:31.604
You just relax and wait for your cut.

02:38.105 --> 02:39.536
Yeah.

02:39.537 --> 02:41.970
Uh-huh.

02:41.971 --> 02:43.870
Hey. Good morning.

02:43.871 --> 02:46.671
Yeah. Morning.

02:47.771 --> 02:49.770
Atwater, hey.

02:49.771 --> 02:51.470
- Hey.
- Good morning.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.436
Here, man, take Sumner's desk.

02:53.437 --> 02:55.503
- What's up, man?
- What's up, bro?

02:55.504 --> 02:56.770
Don't get used it to it, though.

02:56.771 --> 02:59.770
We don't seem to stay
in them for very long.

02:59.771 --> 03:02.503
- How is Burgess taking it?
- Taking what?

03:02.504 --> 03:04.570
You know, you getting promoted up here,

03:04.571 --> 03:06.637
when perhaps...

03:06.638 --> 03:09.970
She deserves it a little bit more.

03:09.971 --> 03:11.169
Oh, that.

03:11.170 --> 03:14.436
Well, she's been assigned a new partner.

03:14.437 --> 03:16.403
There he is.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.670
Hey, man, what the hell
you doing back so soon, huh?

03:19.671 --> 03:21.203
Oh, guys. You sound like my wife.

03:21.204 --> 03:22.536
Listen, we got you

03:22.537 --> 03:25.937
a little "welcome back/
glad you're not dead" gift.

03:25.938 --> 03:27.970
Don't say we didn't
ever do anything for you.

03:27.971 --> 03:29.004
Oh.

03:29.005 --> 03:30.336
Oh. That's hilarious.

03:30.337 --> 03:33.370
- Come here, a little closer.
- His idea.

03:33.371 --> 03:35.169
Oh, you want some of this?

03:35.170 --> 03:36.536
- Yeah?
- Come on.

03:36.537 --> 03:37.903
- It was my idea.
- I didn't think so.

03:37.904 --> 03:39.203
You okay?

03:39.204 --> 03:41.536
All right, we're rolling
out... five minutes.

03:41.537 --> 03:43.136
We just caught a heater.

03:43.137 --> 03:45.004
- Glad you're back, bro.
- Thanks.

03:45.005 --> 03:46.637
Hey, do me a favor.

03:46.638 --> 03:48.370
Just work the desk for a few days.

03:48.371 --> 03:50.403
- I don't want you dropping on me.
- I'm fine. I'm suiting up.

03:50.404 --> 03:53.938
Antonio, I'm not gonna
argue with you about this.

03:55.738 --> 03:58.171
All right.

04:06.404 --> 04:07.703
They had a plan.

04:07.704 --> 04:09.503
They took out all the
security cameras in the area.

04:09.504 --> 04:11.670
Jin checked the pods.
There's nothing there.

04:11.671 --> 04:12.670
They're missing 100 pounds

04:12.671 --> 04:14.303
of aluminized water-gel explosives.

04:14.304 --> 04:16.103
- Water gels?
- It's for mining and tunneling.

04:16.105 --> 04:17.837
Companies use it for blasting bedrock.

04:17.838 --> 04:19.702
Yeah, that's a lot of explosives,

04:19.704 --> 04:21.503
like take-down-a-building big.

04:21.504 --> 04:23.303
We've had enough of that around here.

04:23.304 --> 04:26.770
They're also missing
a security guard, boss.

04:26.771 --> 04:27.903
All right, I want a list

04:27.904 --> 04:29.370
of all the demo-company employees

04:29.371 --> 04:31.503
and whoever signed for the materials here.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.603
Anyone who knew water-gel explosives

04:33.604 --> 04:35.203
were gonna be on site.

04:35.204 --> 04:36.870
Over here!

04:36.871 --> 04:39.804
What's this?

04:42.838 --> 04:44.703
You okay?

04:44.704 --> 04:47.338
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:57.237 --> 04:58.870

05:13.231 --> 05:14.618
Got to go.

05:14.619 --> 05:16.951
- Hey, Jin.
- Good morning, Erin.

05:16.952 --> 05:18.118
I need a favor...

05:18.119 --> 05:20.551
- Off the books.
- Isn't it always?

05:20.552 --> 05:22.051
Do you have access to the city planning

05:22.052 --> 05:23.317
and zoning commission?

05:23.318 --> 05:25.751
Uh... as in?

05:25.752 --> 05:26.851
Blueprints.

05:26.852 --> 05:29.684
Yes.

05:29.685 --> 05:32.985
Without anybody knowing.

05:32.986 --> 05:34.785
Hey, yo.

05:34.786 --> 05:35.818
Your wife called.

05:35.819 --> 05:37.185
Wants to know about dinner.

05:37.186 --> 05:40.584
Ruzek, your fridge is
getting delivered on Thursday.

05:40.585 --> 05:42.651
Ah, finally.

05:42.652 --> 05:44.151
Between 9:00 and 12:00 or 3:00 and 6:00?

05:44.152 --> 05:45.885
Did they say?

05:45.886 --> 05:47.885
- Never mind.
- Hey, Sarge.

05:47.886 --> 05:50.018
Why don't we have a civilian
aide up here taking calls?

05:50.019 --> 05:51.252
It's in the budget.

05:51.253 --> 05:53.518
It's all about who you can trust, Antonio.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.451
- What do you got?
- I'm waiting on a list

05:55.452 --> 05:57.584
of employees from that construction site.

05:57.585 --> 05:58.885
So far, no one's popped.

05:58.886 --> 06:00.684
And you said they didn't get

06:00.685 --> 06:02.518
any blasting caps or detonation cords?

06:02.519 --> 06:04.684
- No.
- You're gonna need those.

06:04.685 --> 06:07.218
All right, det cords and caps...

06:07.219 --> 06:08.484
that's our angle for now.

06:08.485 --> 06:10.317
I got a C.I. I can talk to about that.

06:10.318 --> 06:11.384
All right.

06:11.385 --> 06:12.551
Yo, Sarge.

06:12.552 --> 06:13.618
Yeah?

06:13.619 --> 06:14.851
You know, I grew up in Harvey,

06:14.852 --> 06:16.185
right there near the construction site.

06:16.186 --> 06:17.584
That's Two-Eights territory.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.284
Nothing goes down there
without their permission.

06:19.285 --> 06:20.651
I know a guy.

06:20.652 --> 06:23.118
I think I can lean on him a
little bit, see what he knows.

06:23.119 --> 06:25.085
Olinsky...

06:25.086 --> 06:27.484
Go with him.

06:27.485 --> 06:29.718
Actually, I think I'm
gonna do this by myself, O.

06:29.719 --> 06:30.918
Oh, hey, everyone,

06:30.919 --> 06:32.751
Atwater's been in the unit two minutes,

06:32.752 --> 06:34.651
and already he's put himself in charge.

06:34.652 --> 06:36.918
Hey.

06:36.919 --> 06:38.085
Congrats, bud.

06:38.086 --> 06:39.451
I knew you were management material.

06:39.452 --> 06:41.323
Oh, no, no, that's not
what I was trying to say.

06:41.324 --> 06:44.317
- What were you saying?
- It's just...

06:44.318 --> 06:45.884
Oh, you're worried about
your white-cop partner

06:45.885 --> 06:47.985
- blowing the deal?
- Yeah.

06:47.986 --> 06:49.818
Maybe after 20 years working undercover,

06:49.819 --> 06:52.252
I know how not to get made...

06:52.253 --> 06:54.284
Anywhere in the city.

06:54.285 --> 06:55.952
My bad.

06:57.652 --> 06:59.384
Antonio, I need a solid.

06:59.385 --> 07:00.484
Yeah, sure.

07:00.485 --> 07:02.185
All right.

07:02.186 --> 07:03.918
You remember Nadia?

07:03.919 --> 07:07.085
She helped us out back
with Muñoz and Burgess.

07:07.086 --> 07:09.252
Nadia? Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember Nadia.

07:09.253 --> 07:10.885
Okay. She's getting out of rehab today.

07:10.886 --> 07:12.484
I'm supposed to pick her up.

07:12.485 --> 07:14.252
Please don't tell me
you're gonna ask me to...

07:14.253 --> 07:15.451
Dude, I'm serious.

07:15.452 --> 07:18.718
Not today. I need some help.

07:18.719 --> 07:21.718
No sweat. What's the address?

07:21.719 --> 07:24.551
Thank you.

07:24.552 --> 07:26.618
Just keep her up here, all right?

07:26.619 --> 07:27.918
I don't want her going anywhere

07:27.919 --> 07:30.684
until I can take her home after shift.

07:30.685 --> 07:34.319
Copy that.

07:36.786 --> 07:40.252
It's cold.

07:40.253 --> 07:41.785
- What's up, Halstead?
- Hey.

07:41.786 --> 07:43.152
- Who's your friend?
- Ruzek.

07:43.153 --> 07:45.918
- Ruzek, Mouse.
- What's up, man?

07:45.919 --> 07:47.451
- Have some fries.
- Hey, listen...

07:47.452 --> 07:48.318
Can you tell me anything

07:48.319 --> 07:50.651
about this construction-site
robbery in Harvey?

07:50.652 --> 07:52.252
I might be tapped in on that.

07:52.253 --> 07:53.985
- Yeah?
- It's my ears, man.

07:53.986 --> 07:55.851
They get so waxy these days.

07:55.852 --> 07:58.417
Oh, yeah, so waxy these days, yeah...

07:58.418 --> 07:59.751
his ears, yeah.

07:59.752 --> 08:00.885
Yeah. Ding-ding.

08:00.886 --> 08:02.551
Clear as a bell, just like that.

08:02.552 --> 08:04.484
Just like that.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.085
There's lots of talk.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.484
There's this new player in town.
He's looking for some bangers.

08:09.485 --> 08:12.852
I'm kind of serving as a consultant.

08:15.352 --> 08:17.584
Can you get us a meeting?

08:17.585 --> 08:21.384
Tell him we're offering
blasting caps and det cord.

08:21.385 --> 08:23.284
- What, straight up?
- Yeah, straight up.

08:23.285 --> 08:26.286
All you're doing is organizing a meet.

08:28.285 --> 08:29.351
All right.

08:29.352 --> 08:30.851
Drive toward Erie and Sedgwick.

08:30.852 --> 08:33.885
- Right on, man.
- I'll set it up.

08:42.452 --> 08:44.118
Oh.

08:44.119 --> 08:45.851
Commander At-At.

08:45.852 --> 08:46.885
What's good, son?

08:46.886 --> 08:48.085
Straight and narrow. You know me.

08:48.086 --> 08:49.851
Yeah. Well, you always were.

08:49.852 --> 08:51.484
You always were.

08:51.485 --> 08:52.651
So what's up, man?

08:52.652 --> 08:54.351
If only you could shoot
free throws straight.

08:54.352 --> 08:56.584
Come on, man, I kept people
out the paint, didn't I?

08:56.585 --> 08:58.152
Nobody told me I had to score too.

08:58.153 --> 09:00.651
True.

09:00.652 --> 09:02.252
What's up, man? Where the uniform at?

09:02.253 --> 09:04.417
I'm on to big and better things now.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.518
- Special unit.
- Yeah?

09:05.519 --> 09:06.518
Yeah.

09:06.519 --> 09:07.718
Well, look at you.

09:07.719 --> 09:09.985
- Look at you.
- You know it.

09:09.986 --> 09:11.185
So what's up, man?

09:11.186 --> 09:12.252
You know I got the hookup

09:12.253 --> 09:13.518
over there at the convention center.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.384
I can get you and the
crew wholesale electronics

09:15.385 --> 09:16.885
right after the big C.E. Show.

09:16.886 --> 09:18.776
I'm talking about Wii's, PlayStation's,

09:18.777 --> 09:20.400
everything you like,
all on the up-and-up.

09:20.401 --> 09:21.751
Yeah?

09:21.752 --> 09:23.252
I'm listening. What's up?

09:23.253 --> 09:27.384
Just need you to introduce
me to Copeland Briggs.

09:29.685 --> 09:31.518
No way, man.

09:31.519 --> 09:32.684
Come on, dog.

09:32.685 --> 09:34.118
You're like my brother, man.

09:34.119 --> 09:36.451
We are.

09:36.452 --> 09:38.518
But listen, man, let me tell you something.

09:38.519 --> 09:40.751
If you think for one second

09:40.752 --> 09:42.451
that a couple wholesale Wii's

09:42.452 --> 09:44.551
is gonna get your jolly
green giant-looking ass

09:44.552 --> 09:46.618
into Copeland Briggs,

09:46.619 --> 09:48.618
you got another thing coming, brother.

09:56.485 --> 09:58.885
Yeah, what's that?

09:59.786 --> 10:02.317
You sit me down next to Briggs,

10:02.318 --> 10:06.518
you always got that number
next time you get pinched.

10:06.519 --> 10:10.252
You know how much that's worth.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.352
Hey.

10:23.952 --> 10:27.918
As requested.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.451
Nobody knows about this?

10:29.452 --> 10:31.785
- Nope.
- Not even you?

10:31.786 --> 10:35.386
I have no idea what you're talking about.

10:40.019 --> 10:42.918
Delaney, I'm glad Platt partnered us up.

10:42.919 --> 10:44.018
I've been looking forward

10:44.019 --> 10:45.718
to working with an experienced officer.

10:45.719 --> 10:46.985
My name's Burgess.

10:46.986 --> 10:48.785
Yeah, well, I'm gonna park it right here.

10:48.786 --> 10:51.085
Do you see something?

10:51.086 --> 10:52.818
Are we onto something?

10:52.819 --> 10:56.819
I'm just gonna rest my eyes for a minute.

11:17.119 --> 11:18.885
- What is it?
- Uh, Burgess.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.985
She got a sleeping beauty.

11:20.986 --> 11:22.684
Burgess, huh?

11:22.685 --> 11:26.417
Just get your head in the game.

11:26.418 --> 11:27.718
Okay, pards.

11:36.418 --> 11:38.417
How well you know these guys, Mouse?

11:38.418 --> 11:40.985
I don't know. How well does
anybody know anybody, you know?

11:40.986 --> 11:42.484
That's not that helpful.

11:42.485 --> 11:44.718
What do we got?

11:55.051 --> 11:57.484
You're looking for some
stuff I can get for you.

11:57.485 --> 11:58.817
Stuff?

11:58.818 --> 12:01.350
- Like what exactly?
- Blasting caps, det cord.

12:01.351 --> 12:03.450
Why would I need something like that?

12:03.451 --> 12:07.219
Hey, what you do with it
is your business, right?

12:09.718 --> 12:11.851
Really, Detective?

12:11.852 --> 12:13.484
Would it be my business?

12:13.485 --> 12:15.217
Detective?

12:15.218 --> 12:17.150
What are you talking about, Charlie?

12:17.151 --> 12:19.484
Shut up, Mouse.

12:19.485 --> 12:21.083
We met at the station with Erin Lindsay,

12:21.084 --> 12:23.117
or did you forget?

12:23.118 --> 12:26.517
No, I definitely wouldn't
forget something like that.

12:26.518 --> 12:30.517
Is there anything you
want to tell us, Charlie?

12:30.518 --> 12:33.551
Nope. I'm super cool, man.

12:35.351 --> 12:38.684
Tell Erin I said hey, though.

12:38.685 --> 12:41.584
Back in the day, she was, mm, something.

12:52.618 --> 12:54.884
What the hell was that?

12:54.885 --> 12:56.517
Just like he said...
I met him with Lindsay.

12:56.518 --> 12:58.384
- I'm so made, man.
- Relax.

12:58.385 --> 12:59.450
Mouse, I got you on this.

12:59.451 --> 13:01.083
Okay, what's our next play here?

13:01.084 --> 13:04.018
I don't know yet.

13:04.019 --> 13:07.484
Uh-huh. I heard what the doctor said.

13:08.985 --> 13:11.350
Yes, this is me healing up,

13:11.351 --> 13:13.250
doing my job and not
staring at the ceiling...

13:13.251 --> 13:16.384
two things I love to do.

13:16.385 --> 13:17.551
This is stressful.

13:17.552 --> 13:20.185
Arguing with you right now is stressful.

13:21.652 --> 13:23.952
Baby?

13:30.051 --> 13:31.450
Hey, Nadia.

13:31.451 --> 13:33.217
Antonio Dawson... I work with Erin.

13:33.218 --> 13:34.717
Yeah, I remember.

13:34.718 --> 13:37.250
Well, she's very sorry,
but a case jumped off,

13:37.251 --> 13:39.384
so I'm supposed to bring
you back to the District.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.250
It's cool. I'll take the bus.

13:41.251 --> 13:45.050
Are you kidding me right now?

13:45.051 --> 13:46.784
Come on.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.984
I mean, it's a little weird.

13:48.985 --> 13:50.751
You know, Lindsay's
supposed to be picking me up.

13:50.752 --> 13:52.350
She dodges my texts.

13:52.351 --> 13:55.085
Now a cop shows up and
wants me to get in his car.

14:02.518 --> 14:05.984
What address is that?

14:05.985 --> 14:08.150
The clinic, here.

14:08.151 --> 14:12.951
Is that a man's handwriting or a woman's?

14:12.952 --> 14:14.150
Woman's.

14:14.151 --> 14:16.183
Right.

14:16.184 --> 14:18.150
Will you please get in the car?

14:18.151 --> 14:21.651
Yeah.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.884
Sorry I yelled at you.

14:23.885 --> 14:26.685
Thank you.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.784
It's my wife.

14:29.785 --> 14:32.984
21-13, we got a panic alarm tripped

14:32.985 --> 14:35.083
at 601 West Adams.

14:35.084 --> 14:38.717
21-13 we got a panic alarm tripped,

14:38.718 --> 14:40.217
601 West Adams.

14:40.218 --> 14:41.584
Do you copy?

14:41.585 --> 14:44.484
21-13, 10-4, en route!

14:44.485 --> 14:46.851
Panic alarm sounded, 601 West Adams.

14:46.852 --> 14:48.851
Honey, I don't know your name.

14:48.852 --> 14:50.350
I don't want to know your name.

14:50.351 --> 14:52.018
But after today, we're through.

14:52.019 --> 14:53.817
Oh, you're damn right we are.

14:53.818 --> 14:56.350
This is far too important.
We have to pursue this.

14:56.351 --> 14:58.183
Yeah, well, sit tight
until I give the word.

14:58.184 --> 15:00.717
Whoa. Hey. Hey.

15:00.718 --> 15:01.851
You can't talk to me

15:01.852 --> 15:03.551
like I just joined the unit, man.

15:03.552 --> 15:05.050
I put my vest on every day.

15:05.051 --> 15:07.350
I get my knuckles dirty
every day just like you.

15:07.351 --> 15:09.183
Come on.

15:09.184 --> 15:12.350
No, right.

15:12.351 --> 15:13.350
You're right.

15:13.351 --> 15:15.183
- I'll talk to Erin.
- Okay.

15:16.318 --> 15:18.884
Charlie Pugliese,

15:18.885 --> 15:20.617
or however you say his frickin' name...

15:20.618 --> 15:22.417
do you know what he's into?

15:22.418 --> 15:24.217
Why?

15:24.218 --> 15:26.018
I just had a C.I. sit
me down in front of him.

15:26.019 --> 15:29.319
He's involved in the construction-site hit.

15:30.552 --> 15:34.050
Uh...

15:34.051 --> 15:35.918
What do you need here, Erin?

15:35.919 --> 15:38.250
I can handle it.

15:38.251 --> 15:39.250
Really?

15:39.251 --> 15:40.484
How?

15:40.485 --> 15:41.717
When? Voight's upstairs.

15:41.718 --> 15:43.951
- He's waiting for an update.
- Just stall.

15:43.952 --> 15:46.083
I just need to move a couple things around.

15:46.084 --> 15:49.083
What does this guy have on you?

15:49.084 --> 15:51.018
It's bad.

15:58.518 --> 16:01.117
What's Voight always say?

16:01.118 --> 16:03.784
Tell him the truth so he can lie for you.

16:03.785 --> 16:06.350
No, if I tell the truth on this one,

16:06.351 --> 16:08.984
I'm done.

16:08.985 --> 16:10.784
Do you understand?

16:10.785 --> 16:12.417
There's a dead security guard

16:12.418 --> 16:15.117
that they left behind a dumpster

16:15.118 --> 16:17.118
like a bag of trash.

16:23.251 --> 16:25.317
Oh, man.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.584
I was telling Friedman.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.684
He hit the alarm. He said, "No, I didn't."

16:28.685 --> 16:30.651
I said, "I'll bet you a
Pizano's deep dish you did."

16:30.652 --> 16:32.584
Well, he's gonna be paying now.

16:32.585 --> 16:34.884
- So false alarm.
- Yeah.

16:34.885 --> 16:36.817
Sorry. They really got
to move that alarm button.

16:36.818 --> 16:38.150
It's right at knee level.

16:38.151 --> 16:39.284
Well, as long as we're here,

16:39.285 --> 16:42.751
I'll take a beef and sausage combo.

16:49.251 --> 16:52.083
21-13 reporting a robbery in progress,

16:52.084 --> 16:54.317
601 West Adams, requesting
immediate backup.

16:54.318 --> 16:55.617
What are you doing?

16:55.618 --> 16:57.250
As we were coming out, I
saw the security camera lens

16:57.251 --> 16:58.918
had been freshly sprayed with black paint.

16:58.919 --> 17:02.117
I also saw the cash
drawer was open, no tray.

17:06.451 --> 17:08.585
Show me your hands.

17:18.718 --> 17:21.349
My name is Burgess, by the way.

17:21.351 --> 17:24.317
Feel free to forget it.

17:24.318 --> 17:25.651
The kid here set up an appointment

17:25.652 --> 17:27.717
- with Copeland Briggs.
- Let me get this straight.

17:27.718 --> 17:30.517
You talked to a guy in
order to talk to a guy?

17:30.518 --> 17:31.851
Sarge, Copeland Briggs...

17:31.852 --> 17:34.350
he comes to you, not the other way around.

17:34.351 --> 17:36.793
It's true. It was worth a trip.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.530
All right, so what's Briggs gonna give us?

17:38.531 --> 17:39.714
Word I got is he provided

17:39.715 --> 17:41.884
a little off-the-book security
to the construction site.

17:41.885 --> 17:44.284
Briggs'll know who's involved
in that robbery, for a fact.

17:44.285 --> 17:46.484
Yeah, go ahead.

17:46.485 --> 17:48.050
What about Halstead's C.I.?

17:48.051 --> 17:49.951
Snake eyes.

17:49.952 --> 17:51.617
Took you guys four hours to roll that?

17:51.618 --> 17:53.717
It was a big runaround,
boss. You know how it is.

17:53.718 --> 17:56.085
I guess I'm beginning to.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.183
Jin...

18:08.184 --> 18:09.851
What do you got?

18:09.852 --> 18:12.018
I got ears in Voight's office,

18:12.019 --> 18:13.183
like you wanted.

18:13.184 --> 18:14.717
You don't say?

18:14.718 --> 18:16.183
It's Lindsay.

18:16.184 --> 18:17.851
She was sniffing around for some blueprints

18:17.852 --> 18:19.050
to a jewelry mart.

18:19.051 --> 18:20.183
I don't know what it is,

18:20.184 --> 18:22.851
but, well, that's something, right?

18:22.852 --> 18:24.150
I need details.

18:24.151 --> 18:27.183
Your father and his gambling
problems need details.

18:27.184 --> 18:28.617
I know.

18:28.818 --> 18:30.250
I know.

18:30.251 --> 18:32.083
I don't want immigration
involved with your old man,

18:32.084 --> 18:35.451
but without details, what choice do I have?

18:54.952 --> 18:57.518
Let's go for a ride.

19:04.428 --> 19:06.828
Keep driving.

19:10.928 --> 19:12.394
Turn.

19:12.395 --> 19:14.793
I don't know what you think
I might've said or done.

19:14.794 --> 19:16.562
Pull over up here.

19:35.362 --> 19:37.027
Something you want to tell me?

19:37.028 --> 19:39.662
Look, obviously something happened...

19:42.495 --> 19:44.160
You told Platt you were updating

19:44.161 --> 19:45.361
the computer in my office.

19:45.362 --> 19:46.994
It hasn't been updated.

19:46.995 --> 19:49.527
Then you meet with Internal Affairs.

19:51.794 --> 19:53.728
They busted up an underground casino

19:53.729 --> 19:55.527
that my Dad owes money to.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.527
Stillwell's been using it against me.

19:57.528 --> 19:59.994
Everybody gets squeezed, Jin.

20:01.128 --> 20:05.127
You violated my number-one rule.

20:05.128 --> 20:07.828
Who do you work for?

20:08.629 --> 20:10.294
You.

20:10.295 --> 20:12.495
You.

20:18.662 --> 20:21.461
Hey.

20:22.695 --> 20:23.794
Oh.

20:23.995 --> 20:25.962
Oh.

20:27.495 --> 20:29.327
Come on.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.361
Thank you.

20:31.362 --> 20:33.793
Hey. Your wife called.

20:36.562 --> 20:39.694
So the next step would be finding a job,

20:39.695 --> 20:42.127
a real job...

20:42.128 --> 20:43.893
One that I'm proud of.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.893
- Do you have any leads?
- Well, nothing in stone.

20:45.894 --> 20:48.060
But there's this woman that
helps out at the clinic.

20:48.061 --> 20:50.094
She said she'd introduce
me to her daughter,

20:50.095 --> 20:54.194
who runs some sort of
clothing store or something.

20:54.195 --> 20:57.427
I don't know. I need to work on that one.

20:57.428 --> 20:59.728
It's all good.

21:01.195 --> 21:03.995
Listen, Nadia, don't break my heart again.

21:04.894 --> 21:07.094
I won't.

21:07.095 --> 21:08.561
I promise.

21:08.562 --> 21:11.395
All right.

21:12.894 --> 21:16.427
Uh, you're gonna stay up
here till I'm off, all right?

21:16.428 --> 21:19.194
It might be a while,
but you can stay with me

21:19.195 --> 21:20.261
till you get settled.

21:20.262 --> 21:22.628
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:38.595 --> 21:40.461
Is everything all right?

21:40.462 --> 21:42.127
Uh, no...

21:42.128 --> 21:45.762
Not by a long shot.

21:47.128 --> 21:49.061
Charlie Pugliese.

21:53.128 --> 21:56.128
What now?

22:00.794 --> 22:03.327
Back then, I was a mess.

22:03.328 --> 22:05.427
You know.

22:05.428 --> 22:07.793
- I thought that I loved him.
- Erin...

22:07.794 --> 22:09.294
You were 16.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.027
He was 25.

22:11.028 --> 22:12.728
He got you hooked on dope.

22:12.729 --> 22:17.227
Yeah. I don't deny any of that.

22:17.228 --> 22:19.027
But Dad had been locked up forever,

22:19.028 --> 22:21.694
and when my Mom stopped coming home at all,

22:21.695 --> 22:22.728
Charlie kept the heat on.

22:22.729 --> 22:24.494
He kept food on the table.

22:24.495 --> 22:26.227
I was loyal to him.

22:26.228 --> 22:28.827
And if that's a fault
of mine, then so be it.

22:28.828 --> 22:32.694
But, um...

22:32.695 --> 22:35.494
My best friend, Annie...

22:35.495 --> 22:39.594
she was mixed up with Charlie too, and...

22:39.595 --> 22:43.094
And she got pulled into some stuff...

22:43.095 --> 22:44.994
Way worse than me and, um...

22:44.995 --> 22:47.428
Hey.

22:50.295 --> 22:52.294
You're gonna be okay.

22:52.295 --> 22:54.461
Just tell me what's going on.

22:54.462 --> 22:57.694
He's got us boxed in real bad...

22:57.695 --> 23:00.662
Me and Annie both.

23:06.861 --> 23:08.760
Well, I'll need a couple
clean-cut white guys.

23:08.761 --> 23:10.127
Got any white guys around?

23:10.128 --> 23:12.760
I'm 1/16 cherokee. Does that disqualify me?

23:12.761 --> 23:14.461
Nah, you're good.

23:14.462 --> 23:15.728
What's the play?

23:15.729 --> 23:17.461
Kid's got a sit-down with Copeland Briggs,

23:17.462 --> 23:19.561
gonna run a game on him, see
what he knows about the robbery.

23:19.562 --> 23:22.294
Hit it.

23:22.295 --> 23:24.628
What do you got, bro?

23:24.629 --> 23:26.960
These are records of anyone
with explosives training

23:26.961 --> 23:28.261
who recently got out of jail.

23:28.262 --> 23:30.060
I'm looking for any mentions of water gels

23:30.061 --> 23:31.450
or det cords in their arrest records.

23:31.451 --> 23:32.760
All right, keep looking.

23:32.761 --> 23:35.094
What do you think I'm doing?

23:39.428 --> 23:41.927
It's Laura.

23:41.928 --> 23:43.461
She nearly flipped when I told her

23:43.462 --> 23:44.461
I was coming back to work.

23:44.462 --> 23:47.060
What does she expect you to do?

23:47.061 --> 23:50.494
She wants me to move out to
Crystal Lake near her sister,

23:50.495 --> 23:52.827
Barney Fife it out there.

23:52.828 --> 23:55.327
Well, she's been through a lot.

23:55.328 --> 23:56.927
I mean, your whole family has.

23:56.928 --> 23:58.827
I know.

23:58.828 --> 24:01.960
But...

24:01.961 --> 24:04.261
I hear you.

24:15.528 --> 24:17.828
Mm.

24:19.729 --> 24:22.094
I met your Detective friend.

24:22.095 --> 24:24.361
He had a look in his eye
when I said your name.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.527
I seen that look in your boys' eyes before.

24:26.528 --> 24:29.261
Don't.

24:29.262 --> 24:31.127
Here's your blueprints.

24:31.128 --> 24:33.594
I need one more thing.

24:33.595 --> 24:35.160
Go to hell.

24:35.161 --> 24:39.160
Just call in a shooter at
the Hancock at midnight.

24:39.161 --> 24:41.395
That should get a lot of attention, eh?

24:44.462 --> 24:47.762
Almost there, Erin... 5-yard line.

24:49.861 --> 24:52.194
That's my girl.

25:01.961 --> 25:04.960
All right, players, listen up.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.394
You two are Northwestern kids.

25:06.395 --> 25:07.427
You sell 100 pounds of weed

25:07.428 --> 25:09.427
every month all over the big ten.

25:09.428 --> 25:11.827
Of which there are 12 schools.
Somebody explain that one.

25:11.828 --> 25:13.185
- Let's just do this.
- Exactly.

25:13.186 --> 25:14.227
I'm gonna tell Briggs in return

25:14.228 --> 25:15.527
for the info on you guys,

25:15.528 --> 25:16.927
all I want to know is what he knows

25:16.928 --> 25:18.527
about the construction
robbery, you feel me?

25:18.528 --> 25:20.160
They feel you. I'll wait outside.

25:20.161 --> 25:21.227
No doubt.

25:21.228 --> 25:24.395
Let's do it.

25:26.562 --> 25:28.461
- What's up, dog?
- What's going on?

25:28.462 --> 25:29.594
Where's Copeland Briggs?

25:29.595 --> 25:31.461
Got some stone-cold wildcats right here.

25:31.462 --> 25:32.860
Yeah.

25:32.861 --> 25:35.327
Hey, well, I don't...

25:35.328 --> 25:38.228
I think I changed my mind about this deal.

25:39.695 --> 25:41.395
Now.

25:53.328 --> 25:54.594
What's up, Briggs?

25:54.595 --> 25:56.694
Who is you? Who is this?

25:56.695 --> 25:58.527
Here to make you rich, boy.

25:58.528 --> 26:00.994
I'm rich already, homey,
in ways you don't even know.

26:00.995 --> 26:01.994
What's up?

26:01.995 --> 26:02.994
Hold on. Wait a minute.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.394
Now, see, these are my homeys, right?

26:04.395 --> 26:05.994
- Now, these are a couple of...
- Cops.

26:05.995 --> 26:09.494
We're all cops.

26:09.495 --> 26:12.328
I think you're in my
chair. Why don't you hop up?

26:14.928 --> 26:17.827
We'd like to know about the
construction-site robbery.

26:17.828 --> 26:20.027
And?

26:20.028 --> 26:23.061
- What's in it for me?
- Nothing.

26:25.428 --> 26:28.327
So how about we let the school
around the corner get out,

26:28.328 --> 26:29.427
let all the kids file by,

26:29.428 --> 26:31.194
and they can see the cops just kicking it

26:31.195 --> 26:32.494
with Copeland Briggs.

26:32.495 --> 26:34.394
Maybe later, we'll get a 12-pack,

26:34.395 --> 26:35.728
bring it by your place,

26:35.729 --> 26:38.760
let everybody know that
you're a C.I., at best.

26:38.761 --> 26:40.728
Or you just tell us what we want right now,

26:40.729 --> 26:43.194
and we'll be out of here in 30 seconds.

26:54.061 --> 26:56.160
Look, man...

26:56.161 --> 26:58.893
Dude named Red Radner stopped by here.

26:58.894 --> 27:00.728
Dropped a bunch of bread off for us

27:00.729 --> 27:02.827
to watch the gate at the construction site

27:02.828 --> 27:05.194
while a bunch of white boys went in there

27:05.195 --> 27:06.527
and robbed the place.

27:06.528 --> 27:07.760
Now, I heard gunshots,

27:07.761 --> 27:10.427
but I ain't know nobody got killed.

27:10.428 --> 27:12.762
That's all I know.

27:16.228 --> 27:19.762
Atwater, sometimes the badge
is mightier than the B.S.

27:21.228 --> 27:23.361
Kevin "Red" Radner.

27:23.362 --> 27:25.561
He's wanted in New York,
Indiana, and Illinois

27:25.562 --> 27:27.561
for murder, armed robbery, and trafficking.

27:27.562 --> 27:28.661
- Drugs or...
- Girls.

27:28.662 --> 27:30.527
Beat a rape charge too.

27:30.528 --> 27:32.294
We like him for pulling the strings

27:32.295 --> 27:34.227
on that construction-site robbery.

27:34.228 --> 27:36.094
He's in the wind, but he's had a lot

27:36.095 --> 27:38.427
of prior dealings with this guy,

27:38.428 --> 27:39.994
Charlie Pugliese.

27:39.995 --> 27:41.194
We have every reason

27:41.195 --> 27:43.628
to believe Pugliese was part of Red's crew.

27:43.629 --> 27:45.094
Tip from a C.I. came in,

27:45.095 --> 27:47.827
said Pugliese's planning on
using the explosives stolen

27:47.828 --> 27:50.694
from that site to knock
off this jewelry exchange

27:50.695 --> 27:52.594
on North Lawndale.

27:52.595 --> 27:55.662
We're moving out.

28:09.262 --> 28:12.527
Can't avoid this.

28:12.528 --> 28:15.828
I know.

28:21.794 --> 28:24.762
All right, be ready.

28:26.729 --> 28:29.728
All right, that's it. Move in.

28:38.495 --> 28:40.194
Hands up. Keep them up.

28:40.195 --> 28:41.361
- Don't move!
- Freeze!

28:41.362 --> 28:43.461
Put your hands up! Get 'em up!

28:43.462 --> 28:46.227
Turn around, get them hands up!

28:46.228 --> 28:47.461
Don't move.

28:47.462 --> 28:49.261
Don't look at me. Look away.

28:49.262 --> 28:50.728
Keep 'em high!

28:50.729 --> 28:52.227
Yeah, yeah, look away.

28:52.228 --> 28:53.694
Anything in the trunk that could hurt me?

28:53.695 --> 28:54.893
- No.
- I don't hear you.

28:54.894 --> 28:59.327
- No.
- Explosives in the car.

28:59.328 --> 29:03.294
I'd like to report a murder
from October 12, 2002.

29:03.295 --> 29:05.793
Victim's name was Ricky Sandoval.

29:05.794 --> 29:07.361
I have all the information...

29:07.362 --> 29:09.960
who killed him and who
helped get rid of the body.

29:09.961 --> 29:12.128
Put him in the car.

29:26.274 --> 29:29.435
- Anything from the other two?
- Lawyered up.

29:29.436 --> 29:30.834
All right, everybody clear out.

29:30.835 --> 29:33.335
Hang on. I want to talk to him first.

29:33.336 --> 29:36.135
Then you can do whatever you want.

29:52.736 --> 29:55.868
You wanted to go by the book, Erin.

29:55.869 --> 29:57.035
Well, here we are.

29:57.036 --> 29:59.035
You know what Sandoval was doing to Annie.

29:59.036 --> 30:01.702
You know why she snapped.

30:01.703 --> 30:03.435
It's too late for all that.

30:03.436 --> 30:05.834
I gave you a chance to keep it buried.

30:05.835 --> 30:08.868
You want to go public
about everything, fine.

30:08.869 --> 30:10.201
But just so you know,

30:10.202 --> 30:12.368
I'm gonna say I killed Sandoval...

30:12.369 --> 30:14.669
keep Annie and Travis together.

30:14.670 --> 30:17.368
Wow. You really are a cop, aren't you?

30:17.369 --> 30:19.135
Bluffing your ass off.

30:19.136 --> 30:22.302
Try me.

30:24.136 --> 30:28.068
You let Voight run me
out of town with nothing.

30:28.069 --> 30:29.702
Nothing!

30:29.703 --> 30:34.001
You were headed for the bottom of the lake.

30:34.002 --> 30:36.968
I begged for your life.

30:36.969 --> 30:41.068
Do something with it, for once.

30:41.069 --> 30:42.868
Give us Radner, cooperate fully,

30:42.869 --> 30:44.135
and you're out in a year.

30:44.136 --> 30:46.669
Clean yourself up on
the inside, become a man,

30:46.670 --> 30:48.735
and then maybe you can
be a dad to your son.

30:48.736 --> 30:53.402
Or give a statement on Sandoval.

30:53.403 --> 30:54.669
And then you and me...

30:54.670 --> 30:57.070
we can go down the tubes together.

31:00.202 --> 31:02.536
It's up to you.

31:06.269 --> 31:09.035
I didn't kill that guard.

31:09.036 --> 31:10.168
Red did.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.502
Where is he now?

31:12.503 --> 31:16.068
He's waiting for his cut of the heist.

31:16.069 --> 31:18.201
He was gonna call me.

31:18.202 --> 31:19.801
But he ain't calling now.

31:19.802 --> 31:21.101
Where does he flop?

31:21.102 --> 31:22.669
Does he have a girl in town?

31:22.670 --> 31:24.468
I heard one of the guys say he worked

31:24.469 --> 31:26.101
out of a warehouse in B.Y.

31:26.102 --> 31:29.536
Never heard of that area before.

31:30.935 --> 31:34.235
A lot's changed in 12 years, I guess.

31:45.002 --> 31:47.135
B.Y... I've never heard of it before.

31:47.136 --> 31:48.834
I don't think anyone has.

31:51.336 --> 31:53.834
Hey, you know, at my old job,

31:53.835 --> 31:55.702
sometimes we'd get called to this area

31:55.703 --> 31:57.435
behind the stockyards.

31:57.436 --> 32:01.502
Guys liked to park there
'cause it was quiet at night.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.736
Back of the yards was B.Y.

32:10.069 --> 32:11.903
Let's go.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.535
Hey, Burgess.

32:20.536 --> 32:22.168
Sergeant.

32:22.169 --> 32:23.801
How do you like working with Delaney?

32:23.802 --> 32:24.901
He's soft.

32:24.902 --> 32:26.368
And you yourself, you once told me

32:26.369 --> 32:27.868
that you have no tolerance for soft cops.

32:27.869 --> 32:29.001
You know what? I don't either.

32:29.002 --> 32:30.502
I want someone like Atwater,

32:30.503 --> 32:31.901
someone who isn't afraid to mix it up.

32:31.902 --> 32:35.135
Otherwise, what the
hell am I doing this for?

32:36.303 --> 32:38.901
You're right. He's a dog ass.

32:38.902 --> 32:41.435
When you got passed over for Intelligence,

32:41.436 --> 32:44.168
I thought for sure you'd crumble
like a chocolate-chip cookie.

32:44.169 --> 32:45.735
So tomorrow I'll put you with Gogan.

32:45.736 --> 32:47.602
He's only a few years on the job,

32:47.603 --> 32:48.635
but he's good police.

32:48.636 --> 32:50.001
Thank you, Sergeant.

32:50.002 --> 32:51.834
I'll just deny every
word of this conversation.

32:51.835 --> 32:54.001
Of course.

32:54.002 --> 32:55.001
Hey.

32:55.402 --> 32:56.602
Hey.

32:56.603 --> 32:58.101
I heard you had a good bust.

32:58.102 --> 32:59.268
Yeah, well, thanks to you,

32:59.269 --> 33:02.302
I get to keep proving myself as a uniform.

33:02.303 --> 33:05.068
I guess I had that coming.

33:05.069 --> 33:06.803
I'll see you later.

33:11.202 --> 33:13.435
It's pretty secure...

33:13.436 --> 33:16.669
metal doors, boards on the windows...

33:16.670 --> 33:19.970
Pretty usual.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.602
This is definitely the place.

33:26.603 --> 33:28.735
Guy just pulled in a van, put eyes on me.

33:28.736 --> 33:31.468
- Did he make you as police?
- I can't tell.

33:31.469 --> 33:33.268
All right, keep eyes on the place.

33:38.202 --> 33:40.235
Yeah, I'd say I'm made!

34:07.755 --> 34:09.320
10-1!

34:09.321 --> 34:11.320
Multiple shots fired at the police!

34:11.321 --> 34:13.887
We are taking heavy fire!

34:13.888 --> 34:15.520
Need immediate backup!

34:15.521 --> 34:17.255
Requesting S.W.A.T.!

34:22.155 --> 34:23.588
Van!

34:26.455 --> 34:28.755
Van!

35:01.354 --> 35:04.055
Go, go, go! Get alongside!

35:16.022 --> 35:18.188
Clear! I can't clear!

35:18.189 --> 35:19.987
Cover back.

35:19.988 --> 35:21.520
Don't move! Show me your hands.

35:21.521 --> 35:24.821
Gun! I got a gun!

35:39.822 --> 35:41.088
Squared away?

35:41.089 --> 35:44.687
Yeah.

35:44.688 --> 35:49.255
Paperwork up the yin-yang,
but I'm toast for today.

35:54.755 --> 35:56.821
Thank you...

35:56.822 --> 35:58.154
For everything.

35:58.155 --> 36:01.921
That's why you have backup.

36:01.922 --> 36:05.188
Yeah, I guess so.

36:22.555 --> 36:25.420
Hank.

36:25.421 --> 36:29.755
There's a lot of ways
this relationship can go.

36:32.922 --> 36:37.220
I figure this is the easiest.

36:37.221 --> 36:38.487
It's $5,000.

36:38.488 --> 36:42.587
It's 10% of what I just
took off the street...

36:42.588 --> 36:45.389
totally untraceable.

37:19.421 --> 37:21.554
Dad.

37:21.555 --> 37:23.687
I need you to pack up
everything you have, okay?

37:23.688 --> 37:25.054
And get out of Chicago.

37:25.055 --> 37:26.854
Go now, Dad. Go.

37:26.855 --> 37:30.155
I'll call you. Bye.

38:06.055 --> 38:07.088
Adam.

38:07.089 --> 38:08.821
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:08.822 --> 38:10.587
I, um...

38:10.588 --> 38:14.420
I came here to apologize to you.

38:14.421 --> 38:15.620
Okay.

38:15.621 --> 38:18.787
So, uh, I'm sorry.

38:18.788 --> 38:21.587
You're a really good cop,

38:21.588 --> 38:24.253
and you are gonna get your shot again soon.

38:24.254 --> 38:27.420
You came all the way
here just to tell me that.

38:27.421 --> 38:29.554
I like you.

38:29.555 --> 38:31.620
I know you know that.

38:31.621 --> 38:34.788
And I miss you.

38:59.388 --> 39:02.387
He's the only good thing I've ever done.

39:02.388 --> 39:04.021
That's not true.

39:04.022 --> 39:06.420
You know what I mean.

39:06.421 --> 39:08.520
You're a good mom.

39:08.521 --> 39:11.154
Let's leave it at that.

39:11.155 --> 39:12.654
I don't even know what I would have done

39:12.655 --> 39:14.353
if he was taken away from me.

39:14.354 --> 39:17.054
You don't have to think about that now.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.320
So...

39:19.321 --> 39:21.487
Charlie...

39:21.488 --> 39:23.821
Confessed.

39:23.822 --> 39:26.621
He'll probably get a little
rhythm for cooperating.

39:30.822 --> 39:33.654
Annie, I'm sorry.

39:33.655 --> 39:35.654
I should've never let Charlie back in.

39:35.655 --> 39:37.320
People don't change.

39:37.321 --> 39:40.389
You did.

39:45.055 --> 39:47.021
Hey, guys.

39:47.022 --> 39:48.955
Dad's home.

40:00.089 --> 40:01.387
Laura?

40:01.388 --> 40:04.788
Guys?

41:04.621 --> 41:07.322
Sheldon Jin.

41:08.388 --> 41:11.389
I believe he worked in your unit.

41:12.455 --> 41:15.554
Yeah, that's right.
