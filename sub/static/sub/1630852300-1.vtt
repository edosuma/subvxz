WEBVTT

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
(audience laughter)

00:48.541 --> 00:49.916
It was a scary week.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.625
'Cause here's what you got to understand.

00:52.708 --> 00:54.416
A hit television show today–

00:54.500 --> 00:57.500
a big hit television show–
what does it get?

00:57.583 --> 00:58.625
Ten million viewers.

00:58.708 --> 01:01.166
Let's go crazy and say 15.

01:01.250 --> 01:05.041
15 million viewers,
'cause this is a big, giant hit.

01:05.125 --> 01:07.208
Here's what you got to understand.

01:07.291 --> 01:10.333
I Love 60 million.

01:10.416 --> 01:12.083
Oh, yeah. (chuckles)

01:12.166 --> 01:15.500
It's been a long time,
but I remember that week.

01:15.583 --> 01:18.416
That was a scary week.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.291
It was a very scary week.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.750
Those guys scare too easy.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.166
I'm from the Midwest.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.083
I've lived through the Depression,
the Dust Bowl.

01:26.166 --> 01:27.250
I don't scare that easy.

01:27.333 --> 01:30.500
But, yeah, it was a scary goddamn week.

01:30.583 --> 01:33.291
Department stores used to be
open late on Monday nights.

01:33.375 --> 01:35.250
Then they switched to Thursday night.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.458
You know why?

01:36.541 --> 01:40.166
'Cause nobody was leaving home
during I Love Lucy on Mondays.

01:40.250 --> 01:44.166
There was a significant drop-off
in the number of people using water

01:44.250 --> 01:46.500
between- 00 and- 30 on Monday nights.

01:46.583 --> 01:47.833
Out of the blue…

01:47.916 --> 01:50.125
Everyone almost lost their jobs.

01:50.208 --> 01:52.875
Lucy and Desi almost lost their lives.

01:52.958 --> 01:54.375
Out of thin air.

01:54.458 --> 01:56.833
You're asking when did they find out?

01:56.916 --> 01:59.750
Same time as everyone else,
listening to Walter Winchell.

01:59.833 --> 02:04.416
I'm minding my own business,
listening to Walter Winchell, and bam.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.666
At the end of the broadcast.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.000
This is what you got to understand.

02:09.083 --> 02:13.291
It wasn't small potatoes when Winchell
ended his broadcast by saying…

02:13.375 --> 02:15.958
“Lucille Ball is a Communist.”

02:17.291 --> 02:18.500
Just like that.

02:18.583 --> 02:21.875
Lucille Ball is a member
of the Communist Party.

02:21.958 --> 02:24.833
-Yeah.
-And she'd already seen the magazine story

02:24.916 --> 02:28.250
about Desi when Winchell came on.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.875
The magazine came out on Mondays,

02:29.958 --> 02:32.333
but her publicist brought her a copy
on Sunday night.

02:32.416 --> 02:34.500
What were they doing
when they first heard the news?

02:34.583 --> 02:35.500
What were they doing?

02:35.583 --> 02:37.750
I don't know
what Lucy and Desi were doing,

02:37.833 --> 02:41.000
but it was Lucy and Desi, so they were
either tearing each other's heads off

02:41.083 --> 02:42.583
or tearing each other's clothes off.

02:42.666 --> 02:45.791
ANNOUNCER (over radio): It's time,
America, time for Walter Winchell.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.875
Presented to you by Gruen,
the Precision watch.

02:48.958 --> 02:51.166
Gruen, the finest watch you can wear.

02:51.250 --> 02:53.625
-Gruen, the finest watch you can give,
brings you the man… -(door opens)

02:53.708 --> 02:55.833
-Lucy, I'm home.
-(door closes)

02:55.916 --> 02:58.791
Where the hell have you been,
you Cuban dimwit?!

02:58.875 --> 03:00.208
Oye, easy does it.

03:00.291 --> 03:02.125
You philandering bongo player!

03:02.208 --> 03:03.500
-I was playing cards with–
-(slap)

03:03.583 --> 03:05.583
-Hey! I was playing cards with– coño.
-(slap)

03:05.666 --> 03:07.708
-Oh, damn it.
-You tell me when it starts to hurt.

03:09.125 --> 03:11.333
-- The boat? The… -- Yes,
we were playing cards on the boat.

03:11.416 --> 03:14.166
Since last night? Since 27 hours ago?

03:14.250 --> 03:16.250
-Yes.
-And you couldn't get to a phone?

03:16.333 --> 03:17.416
-No.
-Why?

03:17.500 --> 03:18.666
I was passed out a lot of that time.

03:18.750 --> 03:19.791
(Lucille groans angrily)

03:21.125 --> 03:23.833
That's tomorrow's Confidential.

03:23.916 --> 03:25.583
Why do you even read that magazine?

03:25.666 --> 03:27.125
-Why do I even–
Well, in this case… -(Desi groans)

03:27.208 --> 03:29.208
…it's 'cause my husband's on the cover
with another woman.

03:29.291 --> 03:30.916
So it caught my eye.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.083
The story chronicles a night on the town
with you and the…

03:33.166 --> 03:34.625
That's somebody's niece.

03:34.708 --> 03:36.583
-What the hell do I care if
it's somebody's niece? -From Westinghouse.

03:36.666 --> 03:38.500
That's the Westinghouse corporate–
You were there.

03:38.583 --> 03:40.041
That's the guy's niece.

03:40.125 --> 03:43.416
That picture was taken last summer.

03:44.916 --> 03:46.125
You're right.

03:46.208 --> 03:48.833
This was taken
at the Westinghouse corporate retreat.

03:48.916 --> 03:50.958
-Yes.
-I apologize.

03:51.041 --> 03:54.000
-Hmm. Say, “Desi,
I apologize for doubting you…” -No.

03:54.083 --> 03:58.208
“…for I see now that this picture
was taken not last Wednesday night

03:58.291 --> 04:01.083
“but six months ago
at the Westinghouse corporate retreat,

04:01.166 --> 04:03.666
and I will never doubt
your love for me again.”

04:03.750 --> 04:05.833
-Say that.
-No, and you're doing it again.

04:05.916 --> 04:08.125
You're pronouncing it “Westing-gouse.”

04:08.208 --> 04:09.625
It is “Westing-gouse.”

04:09.708 --> 04:11.083
“Westinghouse.”

04:11.166 --> 04:14.083
Say, “G-H-O-S-T.”

04:14.166 --> 04:15.208
“Ghost.”

04:15.291 --> 04:17.208
You don't pronounce an “H” after a “G.”

04:17.291 --> 04:18.791
“Westing-gouse.”

04:19.958 --> 04:22.500
LUCILLE (breathlessly):
Everything in the magazine was made up?

04:22.583 --> 04:24.291
I haven't read the story in the magazine,

04:24.375 --> 04:26.541
but unless the story's about me
playing cards on the boat…

04:26.625 --> 04:28.750
-LUCILLE (panting): It's not.
-Then, yes, it's made up.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.458
Amor, get it through your head.

04:30.541 --> 04:33.833
-You are the only thing I want.
-(kissing)

04:33.916 --> 04:35.500
Well, then you're an idiot.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.291
-Ah, come here.
-(both moaning)

04:37.375 --> 04:38.875
The House Committee
on Un-American Activities is holding

04:38.958 --> 04:40.375
a secret session in California.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.541
The most popular of all television stars

04:42.625 --> 04:46.500
was confronted with her membership
in the Communist Party.

04:47.583 --> 04:50.583
-Wait! (panting)
-Wait.

04:50.666 --> 04:51.750
Wait.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.000
(panting)

04:54.083 --> 04:55.666
What did he say?

04:55.750 --> 04:58.875
He said, “The most popular
of all television stars was…”

04:58.958 --> 05:02.166
“Was confronted with her membership
in the Communist Party.”

05:02.250 --> 05:04.375
Yes.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.708
He could have been talking about
Imogene Coca.

05:06.791 --> 05:08.125
Fuck you.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.625
He was not talking about Imogene Coca.

05:20.208 --> 05:22.208
(quiet chatter)

05:27.166 --> 05:28.875
This is nonsense.

05:28.958 --> 05:32.083
It's nonsense, and it will get worse
before it gets better.

05:32.166 --> 05:35.958
Little Rusty Hamer,
when he signed his contract–

05:36.041 --> 05:38.291
or the guardian,
whoever signs the contract for him–

05:38.375 --> 05:40.833
he had to sign a loyalty pledge.

05:40.916 --> 05:42.000
Did anyone know that?

05:44.166 --> 05:45.500
Hmm?

05:45.583 --> 05:47.208
Bill?

05:49.208 --> 05:50.833
Bill?

05:52.291 --> 05:53.416
Is she talking to me?

05:53.500 --> 05:54.708
Yeah.

05:54.791 --> 05:56.000
'Cause she knows I'm here?
She can see me?

05:56.083 --> 05:57.416
Yes.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.750
Did you know Little Rusty
had to sign a loyalty pledge?

05:59.833 --> 06:01.333
I don't know who the fuck Little Rusty is.

06:01.416 --> 06:03.250
Rusty Hamer from The Danny Thomas Show.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.666
-That's not his name.
-It is his name.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.458
-The littlest kid from Danny's show?
-Yes.

06:06.541 --> 06:08.541
Rusty is the character's name,
not the actor.

06:08.625 --> 06:11.583
They're both named Rusty.
Rusty Williams is played by Rusty Hamer.

06:11.666 --> 06:12.750
And Hamer's a Communist?

06:12.833 --> 06:14.541
He's seven years old.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.791
-And he's interested in politics?
-No, imbecile.

06:16.875 --> 06:20.250
I'm saying he's seven years old
and they made him sign a loyalty pledge.

06:20.333 --> 06:21.666
Uh-huh?

06:21.750 --> 06:23.541
This is getting out of hand was my point.

06:23.625 --> 06:26.583
Why isn't Danny Thomas's kid
named Rusty Thomas?

06:26.666 --> 06:27.916
Are you drunk?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.708
It's00 a.m., Vivian,
so, you know, of course.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.416
Bob and Jess and I were up all weekend

06:32.500 --> 06:33.916
working on the script
you're about to read,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.041
so on behalf of all of us, I want to say
how much we appreciate your respect.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.500
Believe me, you do not want me
to read this sober.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.458
I'm starting to get a little tired
of your casual insults.

06:42.541 --> 06:45.208
Well, my insults don't feel like
putting on a fucking tuxedo for you, kid.

06:45.291 --> 06:48.083
Jess, why don't you tell your supporting
cast that we don't work for him either.

06:48.166 --> 06:49.833
You all work for me!

06:50.916 --> 06:54.291
Wh… What you all
have to understand is this.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.458
Here's what you have to understand.

06:58.541 --> 06:59.625
We're all tense.

07:07.208 --> 07:09.166
Seriously? That was it?

07:09.250 --> 07:12.083
We're all tense.
And the cure for that is just do the show.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.125
Normal production week.

07:14.208 --> 07:15.416
We're gonna need someone
to play Lucy and Ricky.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.500
Those are critical roles.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.791
The two of them are in Desi's office

07:18.875 --> 07:20.583
meeting with the network
and the sponsor right now.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.125
I'm sure there's an explanation.
This will all be over by show night.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.958
One way or the other.

07:24.041 --> 07:25.208
Yeah. No.

07:25.291 --> 07:26.625
Let me be clear.

07:26.708 --> 07:28.458
I said, “This will all be over
by show night.”

07:28.541 --> 07:30.250
Bill said, “One way or the other.”
That's gallows humor.

07:30.333 --> 07:31.416
I said, “Yeah,” but I did not…

07:31.500 --> 07:34.041
-The sooner you stop talking…
-Yeah.

07:34.125 --> 07:37.708
I think everyone's acquainted,
but let's go around. Joe.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.833
Uh, Joe Strickland, CBS.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.458
Howard Wenke, also CBS.

07:40.541 --> 07:42.583
Roger Otter, Philip Morris.

07:42.666 --> 07:45.125
Irwin Gotlieb, attorney for Desilu.

07:45.208 --> 07:47.791
Sam Stein, attorney for Lucille Ball.

07:47.875 --> 07:50.333
Tip Tribby, VP of Public Relations
for Philip Morris.

07:50.416 --> 07:53.958
Tip, if Winchell had it cold,
he'd have used her name,

07:54.041 --> 07:56.625
it would have been at the top of the show,
not the bottom,

07:56.708 --> 08:00.000
and this morning, we'd be reading about it
on the front page of every paper.

08:00.083 --> 08:01.541
-Am I right?
-Yes.

08:01.625 --> 08:02.875
They don't have it.

08:02.958 --> 08:05.541
Can you see where CBS might be concerned
that there's an it to have?

08:05.625 --> 08:07.916
-Do you see that?
-Uh, couldn't follow you.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.708
Lucy, you need to tell me right here
and now what the hell is going on.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.375
You don't want to talk to my wife
like that, amigo.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.750
Or what, Des, you're gonna beat me up?

08:13.833 --> 08:14.916
Oh, she will.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.166
So we're done with introductions?

08:17.250 --> 08:19.333
I'm not a Communist,
I've never been a Communist,

08:19.416 --> 08:21.125
but technically, yeah, I am.

08:21.208 --> 08:22.666
Jesus Christ.

08:22.750 --> 08:23.916
Do you get what's happening here?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.416
Do you know that this is not funny?

08:25.500 --> 08:28.041
Yes, I do get what's happening,
and, yes, I know it's not funny.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.250
-Lucy…
-My father died when I was very young.

08:30.333 --> 08:33.083
I was raised by my mother and my
grandfather, a man named Fred C. Hunt.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.291
I'd like everyone but Howard
to leave the room.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.250
Philip Morris pays for the show.

08:37.333 --> 08:40.833
And they get their money's worth,
so give us a minute, would you?

08:40.916 --> 08:43.625
(sighs) She's smoking a Chesterfield.

08:43.708 --> 08:46.125
Could she at least smoke one of
the seven brands Philip Morris offers?

08:46.208 --> 08:48.208
-Got it. Got it.
-(door opens)

08:48.291 --> 08:50.833
-Thank you.
-(sighs)

08:50.916 --> 08:52.333
(Desi clears throat)

08:53.541 --> 08:54.583
(door closes)

08:54.666 --> 08:57.750
Fred C. Hunt, my grandfather,
was a member of the party.

08:57.833 --> 09:00.208
This was in the early '30s.
I was in my early 20s.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.708
He never used the word “Communist.”

09:02.791 --> 09:04.500
But he cared about workers,
the working man.

09:04.583 --> 09:09.083
He raised my little brother and me,
and I wanted to please him.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.541
So I checked the box.

09:11.625 --> 09:14.083
Back then, it wasn't considered much worse
than being a Republican.

09:14.166 --> 09:15.166
Hmm.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.833
-Have you been to a meeting?
-No.

09:16.916 --> 09:17.916
-Never?
-No.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.916
-You were at a cocktail party,
later you found out that people… -No.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.916
Have you ever subscribed
to a publication…

09:23.000 --> 09:26.500
My entire relationship with Communism is,
20 years ago, I checked a box.

09:26.583 --> 09:28.458
Why is this coming out now?

09:28.541 --> 09:31.333
The committee investigated her
and cleared her.

09:31.416 --> 09:34.833
But then last week, uh, William Wheeler
convened a special session out here,

09:34.916 --> 09:38.750
a private session, called her in again,
and that's why we're sitting here.

09:41.375 --> 09:43.000
(sighs)

09:43.083 --> 09:44.500
(Howard exhales sharply)

09:47.250 --> 09:48.291
And nobody's picked it up?

09:48.375 --> 09:50.125
Nobody's picked up the story.

09:50.208 --> 09:52.625
Not a single paper, not a single
news network, including your own.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.583
Maybe.

09:56.666 --> 09:58.041
Maybe we're out of this.

09:58.125 --> 09:59.333
We just don't know yet.

10:00.416 --> 10:01.625
When will we?

10:02.708 --> 10:06.000
If you tape a show Friday night,
means you still have a show.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.875
Okay.

10:20.291 --> 10:22.583
-You and me,
-(door closes)

10:22.666 --> 10:24.791
we've been through worse than this.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.625
(sighs) We have?

10:26.708 --> 10:27.916
No.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.791
That's what I thought.

10:31.875 --> 10:33.250
(Desi clears throat)

10:33.333 --> 10:36.583
Hey. The whole piece
was invented out of thin air?

10:36.666 --> 10:40.333
-Huh?
-Four pages, 1,500 words?

10:40.416 --> 10:42.000
Are you being funny right now?

10:42.083 --> 10:44.500
That is the second time
someone's asked me that this morning.

10:44.583 --> 10:46.708
I'm Lucille Ball.
When I'm being funny, you'll know it.

10:46.791 --> 10:49.333
-(chuckles)
-They invented the whole thing?

10:49.416 --> 10:51.250
You don't think we got bigger fish to fry?

10:51.333 --> 10:54.041
-They invented the whole thing?
-Yes, they invented the whole thing.

10:54.125 --> 10:55.375
I was on the boat playing cards.

10:55.458 --> 10:57.875
They invented the whole thing,
and I'm angry at them.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.541
And I'll do something about it,
but right now…

10:59.625 --> 11:00.625
-Got it.
-Hmm.

11:00.708 --> 11:01.958
Priorities.

11:02.041 --> 11:03.041
You're right.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.208
Say that again. “Desi, you're right.”

11:05.291 --> 11:06.875
No.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.333
Everything's gonna be fine.

11:11.416 --> 11:13.500
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
I won't allow it.

11:13.583 --> 11:16.291
I just won't.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.583
Hmm?

11:30.250 --> 11:32.000
-You've never done that before.
-I know.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.291
I've seen other people do it
in movies I've been in.

11:34.375 --> 11:35.583
(Desi chuckles)

11:38.916 --> 11:41.583
For the love of God, old man,
this isn't hard.

11:41.666 --> 11:44.625
Rusty Hamer plays Rusty Williams
on The Danny Thomas Show.

11:44.708 --> 11:47.500
He's in second grade,
and they made him sign a loyalty oath

11:47.583 --> 11:49.875
when he signed his contract,
which I think is ugly.

11:49.958 --> 11:52.708
I don't know why this is tripping you up.
It wasn't confusing.

11:52.791 --> 11:54.791
There's no such thing as
The Danny Thomas Show.

11:54.875 --> 11:57.583
It's called Make Room for Daddy.
Don't tell me comedy.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.666
And if Little Rusty is a Communist,

11:59.750 --> 12:01.875
then I'm gonna beat the shit
out of a seven-year-old kid.

12:01.958 --> 12:03.708
-I have no problem with that.
-I'm done.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.291
That, right there,

12:05.375 --> 12:07.750
was funnier than anything
you've written so far this year.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.041
(chuckles)

12:09.125 --> 12:10.208
That's not…

12:10.291 --> 12:12.791
-I've written plenty of funny…
-No.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.250
(doors opening)

12:22.416 --> 12:23.541
Good morning!

12:25.625 --> 12:29.125
Mm. Don Glass is directing this week?

12:29.208 --> 12:31.083
-We'll be fine.
-(sighs)

12:31.166 --> 12:32.333
You're wondering what's going on.

12:32.416 --> 12:35.416
No matter what's going on,
we all support you a thousand percent.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.000
I'd like to find out what's going on
before I make that commitment.

12:38.083 --> 12:42.208
A long time ago, Lucy accidentally checked
the wrong box on her voter registration.

12:42.291 --> 12:44.500
That's the first act
of a new episode right there.

12:44.583 --> 12:46.916
-Yeah, “Lucy Gets Blacklisted.”
-That's not a joke, Bob.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
You made the joke.
I just put the button…

12:49.083 --> 12:50.916
Last week, she testified
in a closed session.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.750
-She was cleared.
-Okay.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.041
Yeah? She was cleared.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.708
So I don't know where Winchell
got his information, but it was wrong.

12:56.791 --> 12:59.083
As you can see, it was not picked up
by any newspaper.

12:59.166 --> 13:00.416
So let's do our show.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.333
Jess, it's your stage.

13:02.416 --> 13:03.583
(clears throat)

13:03.666 --> 13:05.208
I Love Lucy, episode 204.

13:05.291 --> 13:07.458
Season two, episode four.

13:07.541 --> 13:09.208
“Ethel and Fred Fight.”

13:09.291 --> 13:11.916
Teleplay by Bob Carroll,
Madelyn Pugh and myself.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.500
Took three of you to write this one?

13:13.583 --> 13:16.500
Okay, come on. And directing this week,
Donald Glass is back with us.

13:16.583 --> 13:18.875
-Let's give him a hand. -(applause)
-Hey, thanks. It's good to be back.

13:22.291 --> 13:25.291
Act one, “Interior,
the Ricardo's living room, night.”

13:25.375 --> 13:27.208
Excuse me. Donald.

13:27.291 --> 13:29.166
-Y-Yes?
-Good morning. I'm Lucille Ball.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.875
I sure know that, Lucy.

13:30.958 --> 13:33.208
I wanted to make sure
because you haven't been here in a while.

13:33.291 --> 13:34.916
Is it because you've been
going through puberty?

13:35.000 --> 13:38.250
I look young, yes,
but I went through it a long time ago,

13:38.333 --> 13:41.083
and I haven't been here because
I've been directing at Danny Thomas.

13:41.166 --> 13:42.833
With the Communist kid?

13:42.916 --> 13:44.083
-Fuck off.
-Jesus Christ.

13:44.166 --> 13:45.541
You don't have to fuck off,

13:45.625 --> 13:49.166
but you do need to know that Danny
does jokes– few people do it better.

13:49.250 --> 13:50.958
I do physical comedy.

13:51.041 --> 13:54.541
-I've seen every episode of the show.
-So have 60 million other people.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.666
Are none of them
professional television directors?

13:56.750 --> 13:57.666
(chuckles) She's kidding.

13:57.750 --> 13:58.833
-I can tell.
-Ah.

13:58.916 --> 14:01.041
I'm hazing you a little, Donald.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.541
It's just my way of saying
I have no confidence in you at all.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.833
(laughs) All right, all right, all right.

14:05.916 --> 14:08.583
We haven't gotten off
to a great start this morning, I think.

14:08.666 --> 14:10.791
And I have no idea what the fuck
you were talking about, Bill.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.875
Ah, Des, I'm begging you, don't ask.

14:12.958 --> 14:14.083
All right, no problem.

14:14.166 --> 14:17.333
I just wanted to say that this show
is made by Desilu Productions,

14:17.416 --> 14:19.958
whose president
is speaking to you right now.

14:20.041 --> 14:24.208
And for the next 30 minutes, I don't want
to hear a word that is not in this script.

14:24.291 --> 14:25.708
-It's your stage.
-Thank you.

14:26.791 --> 14:29.625
“Lucy's putting the finishing touches
on a fancy dinner table–

14:29.708 --> 14:31.458
good china, silver, et cetera.”

14:31.541 --> 14:34.083
Uh, the table is set for four
but there are only three chairs.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.791
-I-I should've put that in the,
in the stage direction. -Okay.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.625
Well, technically, it's two chairs
and a piano bench.

14:38.708 --> 14:39.875
For a total of?

14:39.958 --> 14:41.291
Three chairs.

14:41.375 --> 14:43.333
“Lucy's putting the finishing
touches on a fancy dinner table–

14:43.416 --> 14:44.875
good china, silver, et cetera.”

14:44.958 --> 14:47.791
Table's set for four
but there's only three chairs.

14:47.875 --> 14:48.958
“After a moment,

14:49.041 --> 14:50.375
“the door opens and Ricky enters.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.750
“Lucy doesn't hear him.

14:52.833 --> 14:53.791
“Ricky tiptoes in back of her.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.791
-Ricky puts his…”
-Why not?

14:56.750 --> 14:57.750
Sorry?

14:59.083 --> 15:00.375
Why doesn't Lucy hear him?

15:00.458 --> 15:01.708
Well, he's about to do that thing
where you cover someone's eyes

15:01.791 --> 15:02.791
and you say, “Guess who.”

15:02.875 --> 15:04.083
I understand it's a setup.

15:04.166 --> 15:05.166
I understand

15:05.250 --> 15:06.875
why we need Lucy to not hear him.

15:06.958 --> 15:11.000
I just don't understand why, in an
apartment this size, Lucy doesn't hear–

15:11.083 --> 15:15.458
or, for that matter, see– the front door
open when she's standing 12 feet from it.

15:18.541 --> 15:19.791
We'll work on that.

15:19.875 --> 15:20.916
Thanks.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.833
“Ricky tiptoes in back of her
and reaches around

15:22.916 --> 15:24.666
and covers her eyes with his hands.”

15:24.750 --> 15:25.750
Guess who it is.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.625
Bill? Pat?

15:27.708 --> 15:29.625
-Sam?
-No.

15:29.708 --> 15:31.458
-Ralph?
-“Ricky reacts to this.”

15:31.541 --> 15:32.958
No, it's me.

15:33.041 --> 15:35.750
Oh, yes, of course.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.166
Oh, hang on.

15:37.250 --> 15:40.291
Are we supposed to believe
that Ricky believes that Lucy

15:40.375 --> 15:42.166
-really doesn't know it's him?
-Want to do this now?

15:42.250 --> 15:45.541
That Ricky believes that Lucy is
not only unfamiliar with his voice–

15:45.625 --> 15:48.125
which, let's not forget,
has a Cuban accent–

15:48.208 --> 15:50.666
but that he really believes
there are at least seven other men

15:50.750 --> 15:53.000
who routinely walk into their apartment?

15:53.083 --> 15:55.000
DESI (chuckles):
She has a pretty good point.

15:55.083 --> 15:58.041
-She has four or five pretty good points.
-All right.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.125
W-We'll write a better joke
or Ricky will know that Lucy's joking.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.541
-Ah.
-We can change the names.

16:01.625 --> 16:04.208
-Pedro, Pablo, Jose.
-What?

16:04.291 --> 16:05.375
Because they're Spanish names.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.166
I mean Latin names.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.666
They're Cuban names.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.416
(sighs) Thanks for
clearing that up, professor.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.375
-I'm just, you know…
-Okay, “Ricky takes his hands away

16:12.458 --> 16:13.625
and turns her around.”

16:13.708 --> 16:15.916
-No, it's me.
-Oh, yes, of course.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.833
-Uh, uh…
-“She snaps her fingers

16:17.916 --> 16:20.041
-and pretends she can't remember
his name.” -(fingers snapping)

16:20.125 --> 16:22.083
-Very funny.
-“Ricky kisses her

16:22.166 --> 16:23.291
and then notices the table setup.”

16:23.375 --> 16:24.583
Hey, company for dinner?

16:24.666 --> 16:25.958
-Uh-huh.
-Who is it?

16:26.041 --> 16:27.583
“Lucy elaborately ignores him.”

16:27.666 --> 16:30.166
How do you like
the new water glasses, Ricky?

16:30.250 --> 16:31.375
Who's coming for dinner, Lucy?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.875
Doesn't the table look beautiful tonight?

16:33.958 --> 16:35.083
Lucy, who is it?

16:35.166 --> 16:36.708
Some people.

16:36.791 --> 16:37.958
(audience laughter)

16:38.041 --> 16:39.541
RICKY (annoyed):
Lucy…

16:40.958 --> 16:44.333
Whom is coming here for dinner tonight?

16:44.416 --> 16:47.083
Whom? You mean besides “meem” and “youm”?

16:47.166 --> 16:49.000
(laughter)

16:49.083 --> 16:50.708
Never mind that. What are their names?

16:50.791 --> 16:53.750
-Fred and Ethel Mertz.
-Wait a minute.

16:53.833 --> 16:56.750
I thought you said Fred and Ethel had a
big fight and they were mad at each other.

16:56.833 --> 16:57.916
-They are.
-(audience laughter)

16:58.000 --> 16:59.708
I thought you said
they weren't speaking to each other.

16:59.791 --> 17:01.250
-They aren't.
-(audience laughter)

17:01.333 --> 17:03.625
-And that he was staying at the Y.
-He is.

17:03.708 --> 17:06.083
-And that she won't let him in the house.
-She won't.

17:06.166 --> 17:11.041
Well, if they are and they aren't
and he is and she won't, how come?

17:11.125 --> 17:12.708
Well…

17:12.791 --> 17:15.541
Lucy Esmeralda McGillicuddy Ricardo.

17:15.625 --> 17:16.875
Oh…

17:16.958 --> 17:19.458
That's nice, but is the rhythm
getting old too early?

17:19.541 --> 17:20.750
We'll work on that.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.625
'Cause we want to live up to the quality
of the writing you were used to at RKO.

17:27.583 --> 17:29.458
-That was gutsy.
-That was…

17:29.541 --> 17:33.958
(chuckles) It was a joke about
the writing at RKO and not…

17:34.041 --> 17:35.708
Yeah?

17:35.791 --> 17:37.750
Obviously not an insult aimed at Lucy.

17:39.791 --> 17:42.791
Looking back, it may have been
an insult aimed at Lucy.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.750
Which was very unusual.

17:44.833 --> 17:46.125
Lucy and I were close.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.708
-(laughs)
-Okay, let's take it from…

17:49.791 --> 17:51.458
Look, she was always tough on the writing,

17:51.541 --> 17:53.333
she pressed down hard on each beat,

17:53.416 --> 17:55.791
but that week…

17:55.875 --> 18:00.083
it was like her life depended on
whether a joke was a “B” or “B”-plus.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.875
“She tries to make her way past him
on her way to the kitchen,

18:01.958 --> 18:04.125
but he holds out his hand
and blocks the way.”

18:04.208 --> 18:05.458
There was a Broadway show

18:05.541 --> 18:07.625
called Too Many Girls.

18:07.708 --> 18:08.833
It was terrible.

18:08.916 --> 18:11.791
One of the stars of
Too Many Girls was Desi.

18:11.875 --> 18:14.041
Too Many Girls.

18:14.125 --> 18:18.625
RKO decided to make
a very bad Broadway show into–

18:18.708 --> 18:22.041
and I still can't believe it–
an even worse movie.

18:22.125 --> 18:25.541
They kept Desi in the cast,
but the second female lead was replaced

18:25.625 --> 18:28.333
by the queen of the “B” movies,
Lucille Ball.

18:28.416 --> 18:30.166
A couple of days before shooting started,

18:30.250 --> 18:34.791
Desi was on a soundstage working with
a piano and a drum and Ann Miller.

18:34.875 --> 18:37.166
Here's what you have to understand.

18:37.250 --> 18:42.041
A more handsome, charming man than Desi
you've never met.

18:42.125 --> 18:45.708
Standing off, away from
the pack of chorus girls, is Lucy,

18:45.791 --> 18:49.208
who was unrecognizable because
she was still in the middle of shooting

18:49.291 --> 18:51.791
Dance, Girl, Dance,
playing a burlesque girl

18:51.875 --> 18:53.541
who'd just been beaten up by her pimp.

18:53.625 --> 18:56.333
So she was… unrecognizable.

18:56.416 --> 18:58.083
That's how they met.

19:00.833 --> 19:02.375
(piano and bongo drum playing
“She Could Shake the Maracas”)

19:02.458 --> 19:05.041
-(women giggling)

19:09.833 --> 19:11.750
(giggling continues)

19:11.833 --> 19:15.166
-(rhythmic shaking)

19:39.666 --> 19:41.375
(rhythmic tapping)

19:54.291 --> 19:58.333
(chuckles)

20:04.833 --> 20:06.583
-(cheering, laughing)
-(song ends)

20:06.666 --> 20:07.875
Thank you.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.416
-Mr. Arnaz?
-Yes.

20:09.500 --> 20:13.375
I'm Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha III,
but just my mother calls me that.

20:13.458 --> 20:14.833
-Desi. Desi.
-I'm Angie.

20:14.916 --> 20:17.083
I'm in the chorus and I wanted to say
I'm looking forward to working with you.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.958
-I'm looking forward, too, Angie.
-(laughs)

20:19.041 --> 20:20.750
-Patty.
-Patty.

20:20.833 --> 20:22.750
-Uh, short for Patricia?
-Yes.

20:22.833 --> 20:25.583
-Also in the chorus?
-Mm-hmm. Dancing chorus.

20:25.666 --> 20:28.416
-Oh. -“Do you remember
the first time we met?

20:31.083 --> 20:34.833
You were rudely attentive,
but now you're obnoxiously indifferent.”

20:34.916 --> 20:36.625
What?

20:36.708 --> 20:39.625
It's a line from our movie, dumb-dumb.

20:39.708 --> 20:41.583
Do we know each other?

20:41.666 --> 20:43.291
(chuckles)

20:43.375 --> 20:45.791
No.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.250
Desi?

20:47.333 --> 20:49.458
-I'm Daisy.
-(guitar playing gentle lullaby)

21:32.291 --> 21:33.750
-(music stops)

21:34.833 --> 21:37.000
“Do you remember the first time we met?”

21:37.083 --> 21:40.333
If we'd met, I'd remember.

21:40.416 --> 21:42.250
“You were rudely attentive,
but now you're obnoxiously…”

21:42.333 --> 21:44.041
Wait.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.458
-That was you?
-”…indifferent.”

21:46.541 --> 21:48.250
That was me, yeah.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.583
-This studio has talented makeup artists.
-“I'm Angie.

21:50.666 --> 21:51.875
“I'm in the chorus.

21:51.958 --> 21:53.916
I just want to say, when I drink,
I take off my clothes.”

21:54.000 --> 21:56.708
-(laughs)
-I'm so curious, I have to ask.

21:56.791 --> 21:59.208
How did you know
Patty was short for Patricia?

21:59.291 --> 22:01.250
-My name is Desiderio Alberto Arnaz…
-Ah.

22:01.333 --> 22:03.208
I don't have that kind of time.

22:05.125 --> 22:06.541
And you're Lucille Ball.

22:08.458 --> 22:10.666
Use a line on me
you've never road-tested on anyone.

22:10.750 --> 22:11.750
I dare you.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.125
(strumming guitar)

22:16.208 --> 22:17.958
Would you like to learn how to rumba?

22:19.250 --> 22:21.666
All right. Nice.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.291
And, yes, I would.

22:23.375 --> 22:26.375
-Ah. -But there's absolutely no chance
you haven't used that before.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.625
(band playing “Rumba Internacional”)

22:28.708 --> 22:30.708
-(lively chatter, laughter)
-(music continues)

22:49.958 --> 22:51.250
Mm-hmm.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.041
-(laughs) -I want you to know
I'm not trying to be forward.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.041
I'm showing you this
because it'll come in handy

22:59.125 --> 23:01.500
for your rumba number in the movie.

23:01.583 --> 23:04.000
I don't have a rumba number in the movie.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.041
-No rumba?
-No.

23:06.125 --> 23:09.708
Oh, that's a sign
of a poorly written screenplay.

23:09.791 --> 23:11.291
(chuckles)

23:11.375 --> 23:13.583
Well, we should dance to something else.

23:13.666 --> 23:15.500
Sure.

23:15.583 --> 23:17.583
(band playing slow jazz music)

23:22.791 --> 23:25.000
Why did you come to Hollywood?

23:27.458 --> 23:29.416
I got kicked out of New York.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.333
-Seriously.
-I mean it.

23:32.416 --> 23:35.625
I got kicked out of acting school
for not being good enough.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.333
-Get out of here.
-I will not.

23:41.333 --> 23:46.791
I got some modeling work,
I was hired and fired as a Ziegfeld Girl

23:46.875 --> 23:50.541
but hired as a Goldwyn Girl,
and that's what took me out here.

23:50.625 --> 23:52.041
Hmm.

23:52.125 --> 23:53.791
Why did you come to Hollywood?

23:53.875 --> 23:56.083
The Bolsheviks burned my house down.

23:58.708 --> 24:01.500
-So a different reason.
-Mm, yeah.

24:03.083 --> 24:05.083
-(playing gentle music)

24:19.958 --> 24:21.958
(footsteps approaching)

24:22.041 --> 24:24.041
(plays gentle guitar riff)

24:26.083 --> 24:28.291
I borrowed part of your tuxedo.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.375
(Desi clears throat)

24:37.458 --> 24:40.750
It comes with pants,
but, uh, I'm wearing them.

24:40.833 --> 24:42.666
Not for long, pal.

24:45.833 --> 24:47.416
So…

24:47.500 --> 24:48.875
Yes?

24:48.958 --> 24:50.416
Can I call you Lucy?

24:50.500 --> 24:52.916
I think we should
keep this professional, don't you?

24:54.291 --> 24:55.958
-I was kidding.
-So was I.

24:56.041 --> 24:58.541
Mm. Nice dry delivery.

24:58.625 --> 25:02.083
Uh, what's your, mm…

25:02.166 --> 25:03.166
ambition?

25:03.250 --> 25:05.208
My ambition? For tonight?

25:05.291 --> 25:06.833
I wasn't making myself clear?

25:06.916 --> 25:09.083
No, I don't mean ambition.

25:09.166 --> 25:10.541
Ay, what do I mean?

25:10.625 --> 25:12.375
Uh…

25:12.458 --> 25:14.250
-Goals?
-No.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.250
Mm… future.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.500
-Dreams.
-What are my future dreams?

25:18.583 --> 25:20.291
I should've stuck with ambition.

25:20.375 --> 25:21.583
Are you interviewing me?

25:21.666 --> 25:22.875
Yes.

25:22.958 --> 25:24.583
Okay.

25:24.666 --> 25:26.041
I live in a small house.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.625
And your ambition is
to live in a bigger house.

25:27.708 --> 25:29.291
My ambition is to live in a home.

25:29.375 --> 25:31.375
Like for old folks?

25:31.458 --> 25:34.458
Not a home, not an institution.

25:34.541 --> 25:36.291
-A home.
-Ah.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.625
With a family and dinnertime.

25:38.708 --> 25:41.208
Can I ask an impertinent question?

25:41.291 --> 25:43.750
You gonna ask me why I'm not married?

25:43.833 --> 25:46.166
No, I was going to ask you
why you're not a movie star.

25:46.250 --> 25:50.583
Why are you playing the second female lead
in Too Many Girls?

25:50.666 --> 25:52.375
I'm a contract player at RKO.

25:52.458 --> 25:54.333
I play the roles I'm told to play.

25:54.416 --> 25:56.250
My career's gone as far as it's gonna go.

25:56.333 --> 25:58.500
It's hit cruising altitude.

25:58.583 --> 26:00.166
I'm at peace with that.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.916
So I'd like to be at peace.

26:04.083 --> 26:05.250
I want a home.

26:05.333 --> 26:09.166
You have a lot more talent than the roles
you play have allowed you to exhibit.

26:09.250 --> 26:11.000
Now, how would you know I have talent?

26:11.083 --> 26:12.958
Because I have talent.

26:13.041 --> 26:16.166
You could be a serious actor.
You should be a star by now.

26:17.375 --> 26:19.416
-But…
-But what?

26:19.500 --> 26:22.000
There is also something about
your physicality. You are, you are…

26:22.083 --> 26:23.208
Half naked?

26:23.291 --> 26:25.750
Uh, sure.

26:25.833 --> 26:28.375
-But…
-But?

26:28.458 --> 26:32.125
You, uh… There isn't an English word.

26:32.208 --> 26:35.875
Tú estás… dotada cineticamente.

26:35.958 --> 26:37.041
What does that mean?

26:37.125 --> 26:40.916
It means you're kinetically gifted.

26:42.416 --> 26:43.916
No one's noticed that?

26:52.083 --> 26:54.083
(panting)

27:19.333 --> 27:21.083
Hi. Sorry.

27:21.166 --> 27:23.250
I need to use the phone to call my fiancé.

27:23.333 --> 27:24.541
Sure.

27:25.916 --> 27:27.291
Wait, what?

27:27.375 --> 27:29.041
It'll just take a second.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.666
Your fiancé?

27:31.750 --> 27:33.250
Outside line please.

27:33.333 --> 27:35.958
-I mean, not that I haven't…
-(dialing)

27:36.041 --> 27:39.166
It's just that I got the sense that we…

27:39.250 --> 27:40.500
-One sec.
-Yeah.

27:40.583 --> 27:41.708
(dialing)

27:41.791 --> 27:44.000
Last night, I felt it was…

27:44.083 --> 27:46.416
It's me. Hey.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.041
You don't love me, and I don't love you,

27:48.125 --> 27:49.541
and you cheat on me
every chance you can get,

27:49.625 --> 27:52.625
and I pretend I'm stupid,
so I'm moving out.

27:52.708 --> 27:55.875
I'll send someone
to pick up my clothes, okay?

27:55.958 --> 27:58.791
Love you. But, you know, not really.

28:00.166 --> 28:03.250
I interrupted you. What were you saying?

28:03.333 --> 28:05.291
(laughs)

28:05.375 --> 28:07.375
And we fade to black. End of show.

28:08.666 --> 28:09.666
Thank you.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.041
Notes upstairs.

28:11.125 --> 28:14.208
-Back onstage
in an hour. -(soundstage bell rings)

28:14.291 --> 28:15.333
-All right.
-All right.

28:15.416 --> 28:16.541
-We'll see ya.
-Yeah.

28:16.625 --> 28:18.333
-Okay, honey. See you in a bit.
-Mm-hmm.

28:18.416 --> 28:20.291
(indistinct chatter)

28:24.458 --> 28:26.250
-(door closes)
-(chatter quiets)

28:34.791 --> 28:36.791
(footsteps receding)

28:37.875 --> 28:39.291
(Desi exhales heavily)

28:42.666 --> 28:43.666
It's madness.

28:43.750 --> 28:44.958
Yeah?

28:45.041 --> 28:47.500
I thought you'd be the first one
to refuse to work with her.

28:47.583 --> 28:49.000
You mean that?

28:49.083 --> 28:51.125
Mm.

28:51.208 --> 28:52.750
You're not fond of Communists.

28:55.208 --> 28:57.250
I'm less fond of the committee.

28:57.333 --> 28:58.750
Ah.

29:00.958 --> 29:03.416
(grunts, sighs)

29:07.583 --> 29:08.583
Des.

29:08.666 --> 29:10.833
Hmm?

29:10.916 --> 29:13.375
When the soldiers came

29:13.458 --> 29:15.083
for your family…

29:17.208 --> 29:18.666
…how scary was it?

29:22.708 --> 29:27.208
You're giving me that look that says,
“I don't get scared of nothing.”

29:28.958 --> 29:30.958
Uh… (sighs)

29:31.041 --> 29:33.333
They killed all the animals.

29:33.416 --> 29:34.833
Uh, not-not for food.

29:34.916 --> 29:37.750
They just killed all the animals.

29:38.791 --> 29:40.291
I still don't know why they did that.

29:40.375 --> 29:41.500
Uh…

29:46.500 --> 29:49.166
It's six to five and pick 'em

29:49.250 --> 29:52.541
we've already done
the last episode of this show.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.166
This show, everyone who works here,

29:55.250 --> 29:58.333
Desilu, Lucy's whole career– mine, too–

29:58.416 --> 30:01.500
it may have ended last night
and we just don't know it yet.

30:04.416 --> 30:06.291
Are you out of your mind?

30:06.375 --> 30:08.125
I get plenty scared.

30:12.166 --> 30:14.166
(footsteps receding)

30:18.250 --> 30:19.875
Fucking madness.

30:39.791 --> 30:40.916
Lucy?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.625
Come on in.

30:43.708 --> 30:46.833
Madelyn was way out of line,
and I'll talk to Jess.

30:46.916 --> 30:49.291
-No, I don't care about that.
-I care about it.

30:49.375 --> 30:51.750
You told them I checked the wrong box.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.041
Who?

30:53.125 --> 30:55.583
Before the table read.
You told them I checked the wrong box.

30:55.666 --> 30:58.250
Ah. (sighs)

30:58.333 --> 31:02.708
Uh, uh, well, it takes fewer words
to say that than the truth.

31:02.791 --> 31:04.375
Doesn't make me look like a simpleton

31:04.458 --> 31:06.875
who's ill-equipped
to participate in democracy?

31:06.958 --> 31:09.458
It was simpler,
and it's nobody's goddamn business.

31:09.541 --> 31:11.500
Well, no.

31:11.583 --> 31:13.458
Pretty obviously
it's everybody's goddamn business.

31:13.541 --> 31:15.958
(sighs):
Ay.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.375
(sighs)

31:18.458 --> 31:20.625
You-you… you don't have to keep
checking the papers.

31:20.708 --> 31:23.875
I've got people who'll let me know
the moment an editor thinks about it.

31:23.958 --> 31:25.791
There's something wrong
with the story, they know it,

31:25.875 --> 31:27.791
and that's why
no one's reporting on Winchell.

31:27.875 --> 31:31.250
No. The Confidential story.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.041
That's what's getting picked up.

31:35.375 --> 31:36.791
(Desi sighs)

31:39.500 --> 31:42.708
(groans, mutters)

31:51.583 --> 31:53.541
I like this a lot, Tommy.

31:53.625 --> 31:55.791
-That's a great color for you.
-Oh, I really like this.

31:55.875 --> 31:57.625
And I can cinch the back a little.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.833
-I can lower the neckline.
-Oh, not on CBS you can't.

31:59.916 --> 32:01.458
(both laugh)

32:01.541 --> 32:03.083
But still, now we're talking.

32:03.166 --> 32:04.500
Now we're cooking with gas.

32:04.583 --> 32:07.583
-Should I bring out some shoes?
-Oh, yes, please.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.750
(wolf whistle)

32:10.833 --> 32:11.916
Yeah?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.416
That's a nice dress.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.625
I thought so, too.

32:15.708 --> 32:18.041
You borrowing it from wardrobe
for a cocktail party?

32:18.125 --> 32:19.500
(sighs) Dinner party.

32:19.583 --> 32:20.583
Where?

32:20.666 --> 32:23.583
The apartment of Ricky and Lucy Ricardo.

32:23.666 --> 32:24.666
This is for the show?

32:24.750 --> 32:26.958
-Lucy's invited Ethel…
-Oh, Viv.

32:27.041 --> 32:28.125
I know, but listen.

32:28.208 --> 32:29.833
I'm thinking Lucy's invited her to dinner.

32:29.916 --> 32:33.333
She thinks she's being fixed up
with an eligible guy.

32:33.416 --> 32:34.750
She'd want to look nice.

32:36.916 --> 32:38.625
It's something new for the character.

32:38.708 --> 32:41.208
But the character's
still Ethel Mertz, right?

32:41.291 --> 32:42.500
Yeah.

32:46.375 --> 32:47.291
Hey, don't.

32:47.375 --> 32:50.000
“Does Desi Love Lucy Loosely?”

32:50.083 --> 32:51.791
They took time on that.

32:51.875 --> 32:54.750
“If neighbors hear screams of rage
followed by the sound of…”

32:54.833 --> 32:56.750
-Isn't there enough going on with…
-”…breaking crockery coming from

32:56.833 --> 32:58.958
-the Arnaz house this month…”
-I'd be more concerned about…

32:59.041 --> 33:00.791
“…they'll know what is happening
without having to investigate.

33:00.875 --> 33:02.458
“The red-haired missus
has just finished reading

33:02.541 --> 33:03.875
-Confidential's report on…”
-In your life, have you ever

33:03.958 --> 33:05.708
taken this stuff seriously?

33:05.791 --> 33:07.916
I take my marriage seriously.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.708
And Desi said?

33:09.791 --> 33:13.166
“Lucy, I ain't been with no girls
since the moment I saw you.”

33:13.250 --> 33:15.125
-Then believe him.
-I do believe him.

33:15.208 --> 33:16.541
It's an old picture.
We were there together.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.375
He was playing cards
on the boat Wednesday.

33:18.458 --> 33:20.458
You'd be more concerned about what?

33:20.541 --> 33:23.041
-What? -You said
you'd “be more concerned about,”

33:23.125 --> 33:24.166
and I cut you off.

33:24.250 --> 33:25.291
The Winchell broadcast?

33:25.375 --> 33:26.958
Yeah.

33:27.041 --> 33:29.000
I don't get to choose just one.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.458
I'm concerned with both,
the first thing, second thing.

33:31.541 --> 33:33.833
Understood. What about the third?

33:33.916 --> 33:35.291
What'd they say?

33:35.375 --> 33:38.708
We didn't think yesterday was the best day
to tell them about the third thing.

33:38.791 --> 33:40.583
-Right.
-We're doing it now.

33:40.666 --> 33:45.000
First Jess, then the network,
then Philip Morris.

33:46.083 --> 33:47.958
Could be worse.

33:48.041 --> 33:49.208
How?

33:49.291 --> 33:51.083
You could be playing Ethel.

33:51.166 --> 33:52.666
Got it.

34:00.666 --> 34:02.666
(phone ringing in distance)

34:06.125 --> 34:08.291
Is Lucy on the phone too long at the top?

34:08.375 --> 34:11.791
We only hear one side of the call.
Are we staying too long at the fair?

34:13.208 --> 34:15.958
You don't need to write down
everything we say in here.

34:19.708 --> 34:21.250
We'll know when it's on its feet.

34:21.333 --> 34:22.666
-(knocking)
-Good morning.

34:22.750 --> 34:24.625
Morning, guys.

34:24.708 --> 34:25.791
Hey.

34:25.875 --> 34:28.041
Mary Pat, would you mind
giving us the room for a moment please?

34:28.125 --> 34:30.750
-Of course, Mr. Arnaz.
-Thank you.

34:36.458 --> 34:38.958
-“Of course, Mr. Arnaz.”
-She's nice.

34:39.041 --> 34:40.166
You're in enough trouble.

34:40.250 --> 34:41.458
You're not in trouble.

34:41.541 --> 34:43.000
We need to talk.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.125
-No, don't tell me…
-No, no, no, no. No, we're…

34:45.208 --> 34:46.208
No, no, we're still okay.

34:46.291 --> 34:47.458
-No one's picked up the story.
-All right.

34:47.541 --> 34:48.791
(chuckles): Looking at Lucy's face,
I thought for sure…

34:48.875 --> 34:50.208
I'm pregnant.

34:51.625 --> 34:52.625
(chuckles softly)

34:54.666 --> 34:56.500
That's not at all what I was gonna say.

34:56.583 --> 34:58.458
That's what we came to talk about.

34:58.541 --> 35:01.416
We were gonna have this conversation
yesterday, but other things were…

35:01.500 --> 35:04.000
-Yeah, yeah, sure.
-Well, this is a one-two punch.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.541
It's not a punch. I'm having a baby.

35:07.083 --> 35:09.041
What do we do now?

35:12.833 --> 35:15.041
I know it seems like
no one said congratulations,

35:15.125 --> 35:16.750
-but that cannot be, as these are
three of… -No, no, no, no.

35:16.833 --> 35:18.541
-…our closest friends and colleagues.
-You're right. You're right. Sorry.

35:18.625 --> 35:19.916
-Oh, it's wonderful news.
-Yeah, hey, congratulations.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.125
-Yes! Congratulations.
-Yeah, that's great.

35:21.208 --> 35:22.458
-Thank you.
-Another baby.

35:22.541 --> 35:23.916
-Gracias.
-Yeah, mazel tov.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.541
-Gracias. Gracias. -Really, really.
-Congratulations, Des.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.666
-Very happy. Very happy.
-Yeah.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.625
-Very exciting. Yeah.
-So, uh…

35:29.708 --> 35:31.166
-(clears throat)
-Yeah.

35:31.250 --> 35:33.250
With Lucie,
I was the size of a phone booth, so…

35:33.333 --> 35:34.791
JESS (chuckles):
Yeah.

35:34.875 --> 35:36.875
You've got about seven weeks
before you have to start

35:36.958 --> 35:39.166
hiding me behind boxes and chairs,

35:39.250 --> 35:43.125
and then another seven weeks after that
before I won't fit in the frame.

35:43.208 --> 35:44.541
-What do you want to do?
-Do?

35:44.625 --> 35:46.250
Whatever there was to do, we've done it.

35:46.333 --> 35:49.083
-Where does that leave us?
-Without a choice.

35:49.166 --> 35:51.583
Lucy Ricardo is gonna have a baby
on television.

35:53.500 --> 35:54.875
-No, no, Des.
-How many scripts in the bank?

35:54.958 --> 35:56.125
We're-we're five ahead of production.

35:56.208 --> 35:57.333
We're shooting four
and we're writing nine.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.291
Four. No harm done.

35:59.375 --> 36:02.000
But whatever script you're working on now,

36:02.083 --> 36:04.375
-episode nine, scratch it.
-(chuckles): Okay.

36:04.458 --> 36:07.708
Episode– no, episode nine is now
“Lucy Tells Ricky She's Pregnant,”

36:07.791 --> 36:09.666
and we work from there.
What's that one?

36:10.791 --> 36:12.833
-- Which one?
-- “Lucy Goes to Italy.”

36:12.916 --> 36:14.416
We want to send the four of you to Italy.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.583
-Why? -We think
it'd be nice to get off our set.

36:16.666 --> 36:18.916
No, why do the Ricardos
and Mertzes go to Italy?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.333
-- A vacation.
-- They don't vacation in Europe.

36:21.416 --> 36:23.583
They go to the Grand Canyon.

36:23.666 --> 36:25.500
-They go to Niagara Falls.
-Work.

36:25.583 --> 36:27.708
-Ricky's got a gig at a club in Rome.
-And what does Lucy do?

36:27.791 --> 36:30.000
She stomps grapes.

36:30.083 --> 36:32.291
Lucy and Ethel go to an Italian vineyard.

36:32.375 --> 36:34.083
-Why?
-We don't know yet.

36:34.166 --> 36:35.875
And she stomps grapes.

36:35.958 --> 36:38.708
This vineyard is located
in the 19th century?

36:38.791 --> 36:40.583
-They don't stomp grapes anymore?
-(chuckles): No.

36:40.666 --> 36:43.250
Okay, so we find the one
vineyard where they still stomp grapes.

36:43.333 --> 36:45.041
-(knocking)
-Come in.

36:45.125 --> 36:47.833
-Sì, signora. You sent for me?
-Yes.

36:47.916 --> 36:49.916
Are there any grape vineyards around here?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.666
I'd like to know how they make the wine,

36:51.750 --> 36:54.750
how they pick the grapes, how they press
the juice out with their feet.

36:54.833 --> 36:56.500
There is one little town called Turo

36:56.583 --> 36:59.000
-where they still make the wine that way.
-Easy.

36:59.083 --> 37:01.083
Why does she want to go to a vineyard?

37:01.166 --> 37:02.958
We don't know yet.

37:03.041 --> 37:04.958
She has an audition for an Italian movie.

37:05.041 --> 37:06.708
What does that have to do
with stomping grapes?

37:06.791 --> 37:07.958
The part.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.166
She happens to be just the type I need.

37:10.250 --> 37:12.833
The role of a beautiful Italian redhead

37:12.916 --> 37:15.416
who, uh– como si dice–
uh, steps on grapes.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.958
(audience laughter)

37:18.041 --> 37:19.833
We'll get there. The point is

37:19.916 --> 37:21.875
(chuckles):
Lucy in a vat of grapes for five minutes.

37:21.958 --> 37:23.625
I can see it.

37:24.708 --> 37:25.958
(speaks Italian)

37:27.041 --> 37:28.625
(audience laughter)

37:34.208 --> 37:36.000
(audience laughter)

37:37.083 --> 37:39.000
(footsteps squishing)

37:39.083 --> 37:41.375
(audience laughter continues)

37:46.333 --> 37:48.958
What can happen in the vat of grapes?
What can she do?

37:50.041 --> 37:52.125
-(audience whispering)
-(man in audience clears throat)

37:54.541 --> 37:56.166
It doesn't matter right now.

37:56.250 --> 37:59.333
We need to get back to–
Des, the network isn't gonna allow it

37:59.416 --> 38:01.125
and neither will Philip Morris. Lucy…

38:01.208 --> 38:02.833
Just hang on.

38:02.916 --> 38:04.916
(audience whispering)

38:08.166 --> 38:09.791
-She loses an earring.
-Yes.

38:09.875 --> 38:10.958
-There it is.
-What are you talking about?

38:11.041 --> 38:12.083
In the grapes.

38:12.166 --> 38:13.625
(audience laughter)

38:17.875 --> 38:19.875
(audience laughter continues)

38:25.083 --> 38:26.791
(laughter grows)

38:32.541 --> 38:34.208
Push it to next year.

38:34.291 --> 38:36.083
They're not going to Italy
while she's pregnant.

38:36.166 --> 38:38.458
I'll bet you my next paycheck
against your next paycheck

38:38.541 --> 38:40.708
that CBS won't even allow us
to use the word “pregnant.”

38:40.791 --> 38:43.750
-“Lucy Tells the Truth.”
-That one's Madelyn's idea.

38:43.833 --> 38:46.375
-She got it just seconds after
I pitched it. -Folks…

38:46.458 --> 38:49.166
Ricky bets Lucy
that she can't go two days without lying,

38:49.250 --> 38:51.000
and we put her in situations
where it's hard not to lie.

38:51.083 --> 38:53.000
Okay, it's started.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.750
For the next 48 hours.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.208
-Okay.
-All right.

38:56.291 --> 38:58.833
I can hardly wait
to hear you tomorrow afternoon, Lucy.

38:58.916 --> 39:00.000
Why?

39:00.083 --> 39:01.500
We're playing bridge
at Carolyn's, remember?

39:01.583 --> 39:04.125
Oh, no, no, no.

39:04.208 --> 39:05.833
I can't spend the afternoon

39:05.916 --> 39:07.583
with three women
and have to tell the truth.

39:07.666 --> 39:10.750
-(audience laughter)
-I'll call Carolyn and tell her I'm sick.

39:12.458 --> 39:14.416
After 47 hours,

39:14.500 --> 39:16.958
-she's winning, but in the final hour…
-Here it is.

39:17.041 --> 39:19.458
…Ricky gets a visit from
the IRS, and the guy wants to ask about

39:19.541 --> 39:22.416
some questionable things
that Ricky's claiming on his deductions.

39:22.500 --> 39:25.166
Lucy's sitting in the living room, too,
and of course when she's asked

39:25.250 --> 39:28.041
by the IRS agent to corroborate,
she can't tell a lie, so…

39:28.125 --> 39:29.333
That's a funny premise.

39:29.416 --> 39:30.750
Yes, it is.

39:30.833 --> 39:32.458
But lose the IRS scene.

39:32.541 --> 39:33.833
-Could be a good scene.
-He's correct.

39:33.916 --> 39:35.083
Once I write it, it could be good.

39:35.166 --> 39:36.833
Ah, Ricky Ricardo loves America.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.208
He loves being an American.

39:38.291 --> 39:40.083
He's grateful to this country.

39:40.166 --> 39:41.416
He'd never cheat on his taxes.

39:41.500 --> 39:44.125
-It's very relatable. Everybody does.
-I don't! Neither does Ricky.

39:44.208 --> 39:47.000
Especially when his wife is accused
of being un-American.

39:47.083 --> 39:50.708
Look for something else, and
start working on the first pregnancy show.

39:50.791 --> 39:52.125
-Listen to me.
-What?

39:52.208 --> 39:53.791
They're not gonna let us do it.

39:53.875 --> 39:56.583
-Let that be my problem.
-Oh, I wish I could, Des,

39:56.666 --> 39:58.458
but it's very much my problem, okay?

39:58.541 --> 40:01.750
So instead of talking about
goddamn grapes, why don't…

40:02.833 --> 40:04.583
Look, what you got to understand is this.

40:04.666 --> 40:06.250
-We don't know…
-Jess, they're free to take us off the air

40:06.333 --> 40:09.375
for the rest of the year
while continuing to pay our contracts

40:09.458 --> 40:12.083
and answering questions about
why motherhood is too salacious

40:12.166 --> 40:16.041
to put on CBS, but something tells me
they're not gonna go that route.

40:16.125 --> 40:19.750
Instead, I think Broadcast Standards
and Practices will give you

40:19.833 --> 40:22.666
a list of insane restrictions,
which might even include

40:22.750 --> 40:24.791
you winning your bet with Desi,
and which I have no doubt

40:24.875 --> 40:28.375
the three of you
will navigate beautifully.

40:28.458 --> 40:29.583
You told me to be nice.

40:29.666 --> 40:31.541
Good?

40:31.625 --> 40:33.125
Yeah.

40:33.208 --> 40:35.208
(phone ringing in distance)

40:38.958 --> 40:42.083
I don't care what your first thoughts
out of the gate were,

40:42.166 --> 40:45.208
but your first words out of the gate
were no good.

40:45.291 --> 40:47.291
And what was with you at the table read?

40:48.375 --> 40:50.833
I'm sorry. She was jumping
on every stage direction.

40:50.916 --> 40:51.958
It's her process.

40:52.041 --> 40:54.500
-But that process usually happens
in private. -Yes.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.791
And following your advice,
maybe every once in a while,

40:56.875 --> 40:59.916
the first words out of her mouth
could be “good script.”

41:01.000 --> 41:04.041
Well, is this the right week
for this shit?

41:04.125 --> 41:06.500
-Hey.
-We do seem to be having some success, no?

41:06.583 --> 41:09.208
We're all really tired from
working on this week's script.

41:09.291 --> 41:11.291
Oh, are you sleepy? You need a nap?

41:11.375 --> 41:13.166
-Can I talk to you for a second, boss?
-Sure.

41:20.208 --> 41:21.791
I'm the executive producer of this show.

41:21.875 --> 41:23.833
You can't manhandle me like that
in front of other people.

41:23.916 --> 41:25.458
You just can't do it. My show.

41:25.541 --> 41:26.916
And Madelyn was a hundred percent right.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.916
-Ricky pays his taxes.
-I get it.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.041
And we're having the baby on the show.

41:31.125 --> 41:33.125
There's no chance they say yes.

41:34.208 --> 41:36.875
There's no chance they say yes to you.

41:41.458 --> 41:43.458
Did you get all that?

41:43.541 --> 41:44.458
Yes.

41:44.541 --> 41:46.125
That was a joke.

41:47.125 --> 41:49.416
Back to right before Vivian's entrance.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.166
“When do we eat?”

41:51.250 --> 41:53.333
Settle. And action.

41:53.416 --> 41:55.875
Uh, when do we eat?

41:55.958 --> 41:58.083
I've been living on
peanut butter sandwiches.

41:58.166 --> 42:00.166
Bill, that line's
got to take you over to the table.

42:00.250 --> 42:01.833
-Hmm?
-You need to cross to the table on that.

42:01.916 --> 42:03.166
Why?

42:03.250 --> 42:04.666
-Because we need to…
-So you can see the table,

42:04.750 --> 42:07.666
notice that a fourth place is set
and say your next line.

42:09.833 --> 42:11.791
Uh, someone else coming?

42:11.875 --> 42:16.250
Well, Fred, I took the liberty of asking
a young lady to be your dinner companion.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.500
-A young lady?
-A cute young chick.

42:18.583 --> 42:21.041
-Oh, boy, bring her on.
-Uh-uh.

42:21.125 --> 42:22.625
-Hang on.
-What?

42:22.708 --> 42:24.916
When I say, “I took the liberty of asking

42:25.000 --> 42:26.833
-a young lady to be
your dinner companion…” -Mm-hmm.

42:26.916 --> 42:30.375
…Ricky should take a sip from a glass of
water on the table to keep from laughing.

42:30.458 --> 42:32.083
-And then when I say,
“A cute young chick…” -Uh-huh.

42:32.166 --> 42:33.541
…he should choke on his water a little.

42:33.625 --> 42:35.375
-I like that.
-I like it, too.

42:35.458 --> 42:39.416
The very idea that Ethel's
a cute young chick should make Desi choke.

42:41.250 --> 42:42.708
That's 15.

42:42.791 --> 42:44.916
-Okay.
-That's 15 minutes!

42:45.000 --> 42:46.416
(indistinct chatter)

42:46.500 --> 42:47.708
I'll be funny by Friday.

42:47.791 --> 42:50.458
And when can we expect you to be funny?

43:04.708 --> 43:07.416
-(door closes)
-“Exactly what makes a husband leave home

43:07.500 --> 43:10.958
-is something that has been baffling wives
since Adam and Eve.” -Enough.

43:11.041 --> 43:14.500
“For an outstanding example, let's take
one of the nation's most famous husbands.”

43:14.583 --> 43:17.083
-You've memorized it?
-I've memorized worse writing than this.

43:17.166 --> 43:19.708
-Yes, it's a tabloid.
-“With a curvy, red-haired tidbit

43:19.791 --> 43:24.333
like Lucy waiting for him at home,
would Desi be foolish enough…”

43:24.416 --> 43:27.083
-Stop it. -”…to prowl Hollywood
like a bachelor wolf?

43:27.166 --> 43:29.166
-If so, why?”
-It's made up.

43:30.250 --> 43:32.375
-20 million readers want to know.
-Lucy…

43:32.458 --> 43:34.625
-20 million and one.
-How many times

43:34.708 --> 43:37.708
I got to 'splain where I was
and what I was doing?

43:37.791 --> 43:39.833
How many times you got to 'splain?

43:39.916 --> 43:42.291
(chuckles)
I can't get enough of that joke.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.125
They document an entire night.

43:45.208 --> 43:47.083
Someone in your gang's a rat.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.166
My gang.

43:48.250 --> 43:49.875
(scoffs)

43:49.958 --> 43:53.500
The night they're talking about,
I was with Red Skelton and Xavier Cugat.

43:53.583 --> 43:56.708
-Which one of them you think squealed?
-They made it up from nothing?

43:56.791 --> 43:58.958
I heard on Winchell the other night
that you were a Communist.

43:59.041 --> 44:01.083
That was true, you idiot!

44:01.166 --> 44:03.083
Yeah. That was a bad example.

44:03.166 --> 44:04.666
And I didn't check the wrong box.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.750
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

44:09.208 --> 44:11.416
I believe you.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.583
-I'm just messing around.
-Good.

44:14.916 --> 44:18.000
No. That gets you out of the woods,
but it puts you into other woods.

44:18.083 --> 44:19.250
What are the other woods?

44:19.333 --> 44:21.375
You don't come home anymore.
Did you know that?

44:21.458 --> 44:23.791
-You change subjects faster than…
-Keep up.

44:23.875 --> 44:25.166
It's not hard.

44:25.250 --> 44:28.416
I asked, “Did you know
you don't come home anymore?”

44:28.500 --> 44:29.833
Of course I come home.

44:29.916 --> 44:32.750
Sometimes I go to the boat and play cards.

44:32.833 --> 44:35.875
We drink, it goes late,
it's easier to sleep on the boat.

44:37.625 --> 44:39.375
That used to be once a week, then twice.

44:39.458 --> 44:41.875
Now it's four or five times.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.125
I go home after work, you go to the boat.

44:48.416 --> 44:50.208
You once asked me what my ambition was.

44:50.291 --> 44:51.291
You remember?

44:51.375 --> 44:53.666
Mm-hmm.

44:53.750 --> 44:55.750
And you liked my answer.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.458
She used the word “home” a lot.

45:00.541 --> 45:04.000
She talked about having a home.

45:04.083 --> 45:08.041
Lucy owned three houses,
but sometimes, when she fell into a funk,

45:08.125 --> 45:11.833
she'd say… she didn't have a home.

45:11.916 --> 45:14.000
They eloped.

45:14.083 --> 45:15.625
They bought a ranch in Chatsworth.

45:15.708 --> 45:19.833
They were deeply in love
and deliriously happy.

45:19.916 --> 45:23.625
What you got to understand is
they weren't very happy.

45:23.708 --> 45:25.458
They never saw each other.

45:25.541 --> 45:28.916
Desi and his orchestra
were booked at Ciro's.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.875
Lucy was under contract at RKO.

45:31.958 --> 45:36.458
Desi would be done with work
around00 a.m.

45:36.541 --> 45:38.625
Lucy had to be
in hair and makeup at00 a.m.

45:38.708 --> 45:40.833
They'd meet at the top of Mulholland.

45:41.916 --> 45:44.708
(band playing “Babalú”)

45:48.958 --> 45:51.083
-(audience shouting excitedly)

45:58.083 --> 46:00.750
-(women laughing)
-(lively music continues)

46:07.750 --> 46:09.375
(horns stop, drumming continues)

46:23.458 --> 46:25.083
(drumming intensifies)

46:25.166 --> 46:27.166
(audience cheering)

46:27.250 --> 46:28.916
(horns join in, music builds)

46:35.125 --> 46:37.375
-(song ends)
-(audience cheering)

46:39.500 --> 46:40.708
(lively chatter, laughter)

46:40.791 --> 46:42.750
-What do we have here?
-Yeah, Desi!

46:42.833 --> 46:43.958
A lot of choices.

46:44.041 --> 46:46.791
There's only one choice for me,
and she's got a powerful right hook.

46:46.875 --> 46:50.291
My friend and I saw the midnight show
and the00 a.m.

46:50.375 --> 46:51.583
(chuckles)

46:51.666 --> 46:53.250
Thank you.

46:53.333 --> 46:55.125
Aw.

46:57.208 --> 46:59.208
(birds chirping)

47:18.750 --> 47:20.083
I did the calculation.

47:20.166 --> 47:21.541
In the course of one week,

47:21.625 --> 47:24.583
I see you 1/20th as much
as your second trombone player.

47:25.666 --> 47:28.750
Well, learn to play the trombone,
and I'll give you his job.

47:28.833 --> 47:31.041
Well, how hard is the trombone?

47:33.041 --> 47:36.500
Ay, maybe it'd be better
if we didn't spend the little time we have

47:36.583 --> 47:39.666
arguing about why we don't have more time.

47:39.750 --> 47:43.000
Don't make me feel like a bitch
because I want to see my husband.

47:43.083 --> 47:45.416
-Hey.
-(sighs)

47:45.500 --> 47:49.625
I-I could stay home
and be kept by my wife.

47:50.625 --> 47:53.666
I mean, that'd really complete the picture
Americans have of Cuban men.

47:53.750 --> 47:55.916
What home are you talking about?

47:56.000 --> 47:59.875
Or you could quit the film business
and just be my wife.

47:59.958 --> 48:01.875
But you ain't gonna do that, right?

48:01.958 --> 48:03.333
No.

48:03.416 --> 48:05.375
How about you come to the club more
to watch the show?

48:08.166 --> 48:09.875
I had a picture open five days ago.

48:09.958 --> 48:12.125
You really want me
to come down to the club?

48:12.208 --> 48:13.708
Why not?

48:15.208 --> 48:17.000
Okay.

48:17.083 --> 48:19.625
(band playing “Cuban Pete”)

48:38.250 --> 48:41.041
-(women chattering excitedly)

48:47.125 --> 48:48.125
(laughs)

48:54.458 --> 48:56.625
-(song ends)

48:56.708 --> 48:59.291
Ah! What do we have here?

48:59.375 --> 49:01.083
-(cheering)
-Lucy!

49:01.166 --> 49:03.166
(excited chatter)

49:06.291 --> 49:07.875
This way, Miss Ball! Hollywood Citizen!

49:07.958 --> 49:09.625
We love you in the movie!

49:09.708 --> 49:11.708
-Thank you.
-Wasn't the show fun?

49:16.500 --> 49:18.666
-(knocking)
-Come on in.

49:20.333 --> 49:21.333
Good morning.

49:21.416 --> 49:23.083
Hey, Maddie.

49:23.166 --> 49:24.916
(sighs) Some week, huh?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.041
Lucille Ball's a threat
to the American way of life?

49:27.125 --> 49:29.625
She's a threat to writers,
camera operators and Desi,

49:29.708 --> 49:30.791
but it really stops there.

49:30.875 --> 49:32.708
Have you ever had a week like this?

49:32.791 --> 49:35.083
No, but we work in Hollywood,
and something tells me

49:35.166 --> 49:37.583
we're all gonna have weeks like this
before that committee's done.

49:37.666 --> 49:39.291
(chuckles softly)

49:39.375 --> 49:41.125
-Look what you can still do.
-Still?

49:41.208 --> 49:43.750
(chuckles):
I regretted it even before I said it.

49:43.833 --> 49:46.000
I can't do that, and I'm just impressed.

49:46.083 --> 49:47.250
What's in your hands?

49:47.333 --> 49:49.125
I got you some breakfast
from the commissary.

49:49.208 --> 49:50.791
They told me you didn't have any, but…

49:50.875 --> 49:53.458
I did. I had a cup of coffee
and half a grapefruit.

49:53.541 --> 49:56.250
Well, I have French toast,
bacon, eggs and potatoes.

49:56.333 --> 49:58.291
-Enjoy it.
-It's for you.

49:58.375 --> 50:00.708
That was very sweet, but, no, thank you.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.458
Is it just me
or have you lost a little weight?

50:04.541 --> 50:06.208
I have.

50:06.291 --> 50:08.333
Well, you look great.

50:08.416 --> 50:09.916
Thank you.

50:14.541 --> 50:16.833
-I'll see you onstage.
-Mm-hmm.

50:16.916 --> 50:19.541
-Madelyn.
-Yeah?

50:19.625 --> 50:22.083
Who told you
that I didn't have any breakfast?

50:24.666 --> 50:26.666
(sighs) I don't know.

50:26.750 --> 50:28.958
I think…

50:29.041 --> 50:30.916
It was Tino.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.250
The tall waiter.

50:32.333 --> 50:33.791
(whispers):
Okay.

50:34.875 --> 50:36.083
(softly):
Yeah.

50:38.875 --> 50:41.041
(sighs):
Jesus Christ.

50:41.125 --> 50:43.625
Day three and still no pickup
on the Winchell story.

50:43.708 --> 50:45.541
-Fellas, I think we're out of this.
-(chuckles): Might be.

50:45.625 --> 50:47.500
-Might be.
-Howard?

50:47.583 --> 50:50.000
There's another shoe, and none of us
are getting out of this alive.

50:50.083 --> 50:51.250
Howard.

50:51.333 --> 50:52.875
They're uncovering something new,

50:52.958 --> 50:56.166
they're chasing the original testimony,
something,

50:56.250 --> 50:57.458
but there's another shoe.

50:57.541 --> 50:59.500
There's nothing more to uncover.
There are no more shoes.

50:59.583 --> 51:01.875
-Lucy's pregnant.
-Well, that.

51:06.208 --> 51:07.250
What?

51:07.333 --> 51:08.333
Lucy's pregnant.

51:08.416 --> 51:09.750
With a baby?

51:09.833 --> 51:11.583
Mm-hmm.

51:11.666 --> 51:12.791
How…

51:12.875 --> 51:15.208
I'm… (clears throat)
not sure what words to use.

51:15.291 --> 51:18.250
How much pregnant are you?

51:18.333 --> 51:20.625
Why did you think
you didn't know what words to use?

51:20.708 --> 51:22.916
He means how far,
as a percentage of nine months–

51:23.000 --> 51:24.833
where are you
on-on the timeline of-of the…

51:24.916 --> 51:26.625
Someone should point
a goddamn camera at this.

51:26.708 --> 51:27.875
She's 12 weeks pregnant.

51:27.958 --> 51:28.916
So that means, uh…

51:29.000 --> 51:30.916
12 weeks ago, I fucked my husband.

51:31.000 --> 51:31.958
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! -No, no, no.
-(overlapping chatter)

51:32.041 --> 51:34.083
(laughing)

51:34.166 --> 51:36.000
She'll start showing in about

51:36.083 --> 51:40.500
six weeks, and a month after that,
(sighs) there won't be any hiding it.

51:40.583 --> 51:42.000
This isn't a problem.

51:42.083 --> 51:43.500
-It's not.
-This has happened before.

51:43.583 --> 51:46.666
I won't say names,
but it's been dealt with.

51:46.750 --> 51:49.250
Is he talking about having me killed?

51:49.333 --> 51:51.166
No, you carry a basket of laundry,

51:51.250 --> 51:53.958
stand behind chairs,
you sit with a pillow on your lap.

51:54.041 --> 51:55.625
Those are great ideas,
especially having Lucy

51:55.708 --> 51:57.166
carry a basket of laundry in every scene.

51:57.250 --> 51:58.500
Or stand behind chairs.

51:58.583 --> 52:01.833
Where in the Ricardo's living room
are the giant chairs you're talking about?

52:01.916 --> 52:04.041
Lucy and Ricky redecorate, huh?

52:04.125 --> 52:05.625
The writers can get some fun out of this.

52:05.708 --> 52:07.958
Maybe they get some large ficus trees.

52:08.041 --> 52:09.291
They'd have to be California redwoods,

52:09.375 --> 52:11.833
and I'd have to stand behind them
anytime I wasn't doing the wash.

52:11.916 --> 52:13.125
Well, what do you propose?

52:13.208 --> 52:14.625
That the Ricardos have a baby.

52:14.708 --> 52:16.916
(laughter)

52:17.000 --> 52:18.666
What do you mean?

52:18.750 --> 52:20.458
I told you it was gonna be like this.

52:20.541 --> 52:24.000
Lucy Ricardo will be pregnant on the show.

52:24.083 --> 52:29.166
An eight-episode arc starting with
Lucy telling Ricky the happy news

52:29.250 --> 52:32.083
-and ending with the birth of the baby.
-ROGER (laughs): No.

52:32.166 --> 52:33.833
No, no, no.

52:33.916 --> 52:35.416
You can't have a pregnant woman
on television.

52:35.500 --> 52:36.625
Why not?

52:36.708 --> 52:37.708
Because it's television.

52:37.791 --> 52:39.375
We come into people's homes.

52:39.458 --> 52:41.583
Pregnant women often vomit.

52:41.666 --> 52:43.458
I know I could any second.

52:43.541 --> 52:45.541
-May I say something?
-Frankly, I can't wait.

52:45.625 --> 52:48.625
If Lucy Ricardo's pregnant,
the audience's mind immediately goes

52:48.708 --> 52:50.000
to how did she get that way.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.333
Lucy and Ricky sleep in separate beds.

52:51.416 --> 52:53.333
We'll be pushing the beds together, too.

52:53.416 --> 52:54.875
-Oh. -Oh, no.
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

52:54.958 --> 52:57.416
I'm sorry, Des, we're gonna
have to put our foot down on this one.

52:57.500 --> 52:59.541
You can't do it. End of discussion.

53:02.416 --> 53:03.666
(groans)

53:05.916 --> 53:09.458
Miss Rosen, will you come in please,
with a pad and pen?

53:13.500 --> 53:14.916
-My secretary.
-(footsteps approaching)

53:16.333 --> 53:17.875
What are you doing?

53:17.958 --> 53:19.708
To Mr. Alfred Lyons,
Chairman of the Board of Philip Morris.

53:19.791 --> 53:21.208
We don't want
to bring Mr. Lyons into this.

53:21.291 --> 53:23.791
“Mr. Lyons, I guess
it all comes down to you.

53:23.875 --> 53:26.458
“You are the man
who's paying the money for this show,

53:26.541 --> 53:28.208
and I'll do whatever you decide.”

53:28.291 --> 53:30.500
Mr. Lyons doesn't get involved
at this level.

53:30.583 --> 53:33.375
“There's only one thing I want
to make certain that you understand.”

53:33.458 --> 53:35.166
-Desi…
-“We've given you

53:35.250 --> 53:37.166
“the number one show on television,

53:37.250 --> 53:41.500
“and up until now, the creative decisions
have been in our hands.

53:41.583 --> 53:45.208
They are now telling us that Lucy
and Ricky can't have a baby on the show.”

53:45.291 --> 53:46.416
That's not exactly what we said.

53:46.500 --> 53:48.958
“All I ask from you,
if you agree with them,

53:49.041 --> 53:52.541
“is that you inform them that we will
not accept them telling us what not to do

53:52.625 --> 53:58.083
“unless, beginning with our next episode,
they also tell us what to do.

53:58.166 --> 54:00.708
Sincerely,” et cetera, et cetera.
Thank you.

54:00.791 --> 54:03.166
-And send it by telegram please.
-Yes, sir.

54:05.708 --> 54:08.125
And that wasn't even why I married him.

54:11.791 --> 54:12.791
That was.

54:15.375 --> 54:17.375
Quiet please! Rehearsal's up!

54:17.458 --> 54:20.166
Lucy, let me out of here!

54:20.250 --> 54:21.708
Untie this coat!

54:21.791 --> 54:23.625
Not until you kiss and make up.

54:23.708 --> 54:26.416
I'll never make up with him
after the things he said.

54:26.500 --> 54:28.583
What about the things you said to me?

54:28.666 --> 54:30.708
She said my mother looks like a weasel.

54:30.791 --> 54:33.041
-Apologize, Ethel.
-No.

54:33.125 --> 54:36.458
Oh, come on, Ethel. Tell him you're sorry.

54:36.541 --> 54:37.625
Well…

54:37.708 --> 54:39.750
I'm sorry your mother looks like a weasel.

54:39.833 --> 54:41.750
Now, Ethel.

54:41.833 --> 54:43.125
Well, he should have more consideration.

54:43.208 --> 54:45.291
After all, I gave him
the best years of my life.

54:45.375 --> 54:47.875
-Were those the best?
-(gasps)

54:47.958 --> 54:49.750
All right, all right, now you're even.

54:49.833 --> 54:51.750
Now, what are your terms
for making up, Ethel?

54:51.833 --> 54:53.291
Well, he should…

54:53.375 --> 54:56.041
We should go back to the dinner table.

54:57.125 --> 54:59.750
-What was that?
-We should go back to the dinner table.

54:59.833 --> 55:02.958
I think, given the time,
we should move on.

55:03.041 --> 55:04.041
It was good.

55:04.125 --> 55:05.833
Yeah, except, no, it wasn't.

55:05.916 --> 55:06.958
-What?
-Good.

55:07.041 --> 55:08.666
-Wasn't good.
-Uh…

55:08.750 --> 55:09.750
Ah, let's go back.

55:09.833 --> 55:11.125
What's happening?

55:11.208 --> 55:12.458
(sighs) She wants to go back.

55:12.541 --> 55:13.583
-To what?
-The dinner scene.

55:13.666 --> 55:15.208
What?

55:15.291 --> 55:17.916
The dinner scene, you drunken yontz!

55:18.000 --> 55:19.750
Have we hired anyone to play Ethel yet?

55:19.833 --> 55:21.083
All right, let's go.

55:21.166 --> 55:22.291
Go forward or go back to the dinner scene?

55:22.375 --> 55:23.375
Back.

55:23.458 --> 55:25.000
(sighs heavily)

55:25.083 --> 55:27.625
Page 15. This is still scene “A.”

55:27.708 --> 55:29.250
From, “You're right, he's not
going to do me out of dinner.”

55:29.333 --> 55:31.541
-Cameras reset. Props reset.
-Someone's gonna need to tell us

55:31.625 --> 55:33.333
what was wrong with the scene
in the first place.

55:33.416 --> 55:34.666
-- You were in it.
-- Bill.

55:34.750 --> 55:36.500
Something fundamental was wrong.
I'll figure out what.

55:36.583 --> 55:37.666
I can figure out what.

55:37.750 --> 55:39.416
-Let's all do our individual jobs.
-(sighs)

55:39.500 --> 55:41.208
(quietly): I hit him in the face
until he's bleeding–

55:41.291 --> 55:43.458
-does our insurance cover that?
-Yeah, I got the platinum plan.

55:43.541 --> 55:44.791
Good job.

55:44.875 --> 55:46.375
-Ready, ready.
-Quiet please!

55:46.458 --> 55:47.750
Rehearsal's up!

55:47.833 --> 55:50.125
From, “You're right,
he's not going to do me out of dinner.”

55:50.208 --> 55:51.250
Settle.

55:51.333 --> 55:53.541
And action.

55:53.625 --> 55:54.875
Uh, you're right.

55:54.958 --> 55:57.041
He's not gonna do me out of dinner.

55:57.125 --> 55:58.333
Good.

55:58.416 --> 56:01.250
Oh. Now, sit down, everyone.

56:03.250 --> 56:06.208
We don't have any more chairs.

56:06.291 --> 56:08.916
You two don't mind sharing, do you?

56:11.541 --> 56:13.375
The roast beef should be precut.

56:13.458 --> 56:15.125
-It will be, dear.
-How's that, Ethel?

56:15.208 --> 56:17.166
-Not too much fat, is there?
-There certainly is.

56:17.250 --> 56:18.250
He means the meat.

56:18.333 --> 56:19.791
Oh, no, the meat is fine.

56:19.875 --> 56:22.416
Now do your thing.

56:22.500 --> 56:24.375
Come on.

56:24.458 --> 56:25.625
-Mm.
-Perfect.

56:25.708 --> 56:27.041
-Yeah?
-Moving on.

56:27.125 --> 56:29.125
-Moving…
-Staying put. -Why?

56:29.208 --> 56:30.750
We need to work out
the moves at the table.

56:30.833 --> 56:32.208
Bill and I can work out the moves.

56:32.291 --> 56:33.875
It's not that I'm not confident
that you can't work out…

56:33.958 --> 56:35.458
This is camera blocking.

56:35.541 --> 56:37.958
We can work out the stage business
during tomorrow's run-through.

56:38.041 --> 56:40.416
I would strongly prefer that we do it now.

56:40.500 --> 56:42.958
I have to exercise
my directorial authority.

56:43.041 --> 56:44.750
-You have to do what?
-Let's take a break.

56:44.833 --> 56:46.791
-It's not time for a break.
-Good, then, that's ten minutes.

56:46.875 --> 56:48.875
Ten minutes, we come back to scene “A”!

56:48.958 --> 56:51.250
-No, we don't.
-Maybe we don't. It's hard to say.

56:51.333 --> 56:53.333
(indistinct chatter)

56:57.166 --> 56:58.625
Tell me what's happening, honey.

56:58.708 --> 56:59.708
(exhaling musically)

56:59.791 --> 57:01.250
-You know what occurs to me?
-Mm-hmm?

57:01.333 --> 57:02.916
At the top, it should be clear

57:03.000 --> 57:04.250
that I'm setting a nice table, right?

57:04.333 --> 57:06.708
There should be flowers in a vase.

57:06.791 --> 57:08.750
(humming)

57:08.833 --> 57:10.708
And I'm trying to get them just right.

57:10.791 --> 57:13.208
And I cut one of the stems,
but now it's too short.

57:14.166 --> 57:15.708
Then I cut the others,
but now they're too short and…

57:15.791 --> 57:17.833
-I get it.
-What do you think?

57:17.916 --> 57:19.625
I think you're having
a little bit of a breakdown.

57:19.708 --> 57:21.125
I meant about the flowers.

57:21.208 --> 57:23.875
Tell me what's happening now.

57:23.958 --> 57:25.916
Why is this so hard to understand?

57:26.000 --> 57:27.500
The dinner table isn't working,

57:27.583 --> 57:28.958
-and we need it to.
-Mm-hmm.

57:29.041 --> 57:32.500
Right there are
the building blocks of drama.

57:59.750 --> 58:01.166
Viv.

58:02.625 --> 58:03.958
It's not you.

58:04.041 --> 58:05.625
Or Bill.

58:05.708 --> 58:08.541
The dinner scene. It's Donald Glass.

58:08.625 --> 58:10.708
Well… (chuckles)

58:10.791 --> 58:11.833
it'll be funny.

58:11.916 --> 58:13.666
I'm sure of that.

58:13.750 --> 58:16.125
Can't get better till it gets bad.

58:16.208 --> 58:18.708
-Cross step one off the list.
-Yeah.

58:18.791 --> 58:19.875
Okay.

58:21.416 --> 58:22.958
You hanging in there?

58:23.041 --> 58:24.791
Look, we've made 37 episodes.

58:24.875 --> 58:28.125
You do 37 of anything,
one of them's gonna be your 37th best.

58:28.208 --> 58:30.166
Ours was directed by Donald Glass.

58:30.250 --> 58:32.083
Honey, the committee.

58:32.166 --> 58:34.416
They're not gonna base their findings
based on how this week's sh…

58:34.500 --> 58:35.666
Fuck the committee.

58:35.750 --> 58:37.875
I said that. I'm talking about the show.

58:37.958 --> 58:40.958
And unless you count his wardrobe,
Donald Glass doesn't understand

58:41.041 --> 58:44.166
the moving parts of physical comedy.

58:44.250 --> 58:45.375
(sighs)

58:45.458 --> 58:46.458
That's all.

58:46.541 --> 58:49.458
My point is you're not the problem.

58:49.541 --> 58:50.833
Mm-hmm.

58:52.375 --> 58:53.666
Luce.

58:53.750 --> 58:55.166
Yeah?

58:56.166 --> 58:58.083
(sighs)

58:58.166 --> 59:01.916
Uh, Madelyn brought me breakfast
this morning.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.291
French toast, bacon and potatoes.

59:05.375 --> 59:08.875
She said that someone noticed
I hadn't had breakfast.

59:08.958 --> 59:10.541
She said it looked like
I had lost some weight.

59:10.625 --> 59:12.041
She's right. You look great.

59:12.125 --> 59:15.041
Madelyn's a staff writer.
She doesn't bring people their breakfast.

59:16.833 --> 59:18.375
I'm not sure what you're asking.

59:18.458 --> 59:19.583
It sounds like she was…

59:19.666 --> 59:22.083
How would she know I hadn't had breakfast?

59:24.500 --> 59:25.625
I really don't know.

59:26.708 --> 59:28.708
-It was you, right?
-Yeah.

59:28.791 --> 59:31.416
Got to give me credit.
When I lie, I give it up pretty quick.

59:31.500 --> 59:34.000
-It's admirable.
-Thanks.

59:34.083 --> 59:38.750
You told her to bring me breakfast
and remark on my weight loss.

59:39.833 --> 59:40.916
Let me explain why.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.166
Why?

59:42.250 --> 59:44.250
Because I think you should
get off this loony diet you're on.

59:44.333 --> 59:45.416
It's working.

59:45.500 --> 59:46.916
It's not good for you.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.125
I feel great.

59:48.208 --> 59:49.875
It's not good for Ethel.

59:49.958 --> 59:51.750
Ah, it's not.

59:51.833 --> 59:54.250
We're best friends, Viv.
I don't want to fight.

59:54.333 --> 59:56.041
-I just sent some breakfast over
because… -You didn't just send it over.

59:56.125 --> 59:58.375
You sent it over
with Madelyn and a message

59:58.458 --> 1:00:01.958
and now a new message,
which is that I look too good.

1:00:02.041 --> 1:00:05.000
Because we want you at the weight
you were when we cast you.

1:00:05.083 --> 1:00:06.375
Otherwise it'll be bad for Ethel?

1:00:06.458 --> 1:00:07.708
-Yes.
-Or bad for you?

1:00:11.708 --> 1:00:12.791
All right.

1:00:12.875 --> 1:00:14.875
No one's gonna stop loving Lucy
when you're pregnant.

1:00:14.958 --> 1:00:16.291
You're not a pinup girl.

1:00:18.125 --> 1:00:19.416
Thanks for that, Viv.

1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:22.041
I'm saying take it easy, that's all.

1:00:22.125 --> 1:00:25.708
Everyone here stands shoulder to shoulder
with you and no one feels funny

1:00:25.791 --> 1:00:28.208
'cause we're scared to death,
and you're not helping

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:30.708
by jumping up and down
on everyone who works here

1:00:30.791 --> 1:00:32.500
and doing it in front of the whole crew!

1:00:32.583 --> 1:00:35.791
Goddamn it, Viv,
most American women look like you, not me.

1:00:35.875 --> 1:00:38.041
They want to see themselves on television.

1:00:43.458 --> 1:00:45.166
(door opens)

1:00:48.125 --> 1:00:50.458
What the hell are the two of you
screaming about?

1:00:50.541 --> 1:00:52.333
-Nothing.
-Nothing!

1:00:52.416 --> 1:00:54.583
I'm in my room taking my midmorning nap.

1:00:54.666 --> 1:00:57.291
Don't you usually do that
while we're rehearsing?

1:00:58.291 --> 1:01:01.416
I'd love to hear more of that
Moss Hart wit on the show.

1:01:08.708 --> 1:01:10.791
Don't worry about it.

1:01:10.875 --> 1:01:13.583
The weight always comes back.
I can't keep it off anymore.

1:01:15.458 --> 1:01:17.333
This conversation went poorly.

1:01:17.416 --> 1:01:19.333
I thought it was great.

1:01:19.416 --> 1:01:23.916
I definitely feel like performing
for tens of millions of people now.

1:01:26.208 --> 1:01:28.083
All right.

1:01:28.166 --> 1:01:29.875
-So…
-(page turns)

1:01:29.958 --> 1:01:31.375
Okay.

1:01:32.375 --> 1:01:34.375
(thunder rumbling softly)

1:01:36.541 --> 1:01:38.958
-Lucille.
-Yeah?

1:01:40.416 --> 1:01:42.125
Come with me for a drink.

1:01:42.208 --> 1:01:43.625
It's00 a.m.

1:01:43.708 --> 1:01:45.500
I'm sure it's15 somewhere.

1:01:45.583 --> 1:01:47.250
We have to be back onstage.

1:01:47.333 --> 1:01:49.041
-I wonder if they'll wait for you.
-Bill, I'm not…

1:01:49.125 --> 1:01:50.291
Kid.

1:01:50.375 --> 1:01:52.666
Tell the stage Mrs. Arnaz is
taking some personal time

1:01:52.750 --> 1:01:54.125
and she'll be back when she's back.

1:01:54.208 --> 1:01:56.375
-Probably 15 minutes.
-Yes, ma'am.

1:01:56.458 --> 1:01:59.041
And you should remind props that I need
garden shears in the opening scene.

1:01:59.125 --> 1:02:00.541
-Copy.
-Let's go.

1:02:00.625 --> 1:02:02.833
We have to establish right away
that I'm setting a fancy table.

1:02:02.916 --> 1:02:04.708
-You don't have to explain it to him.
-We'll have flowers in a vase.

1:02:04.791 --> 1:02:06.291
I'll cut one of the flowers.

1:02:06.375 --> 1:02:08.291
-He doesn't care.
-It'll be too short.

1:02:08.375 --> 1:02:10.333
I'll cut the other flowers,
they'll be too short, and so on.

1:02:10.416 --> 1:02:11.875
-Got it.
-So I need garden shears.

1:02:11.958 --> 1:02:12.958
Copy.

1:02:13.041 --> 1:02:15.250
Regular scissors aren't strong enough
to cut through the stems.

1:02:15.333 --> 1:02:17.208
He's thinking a lot about killing you now.

1:02:17.291 --> 1:02:18.291
-Fine.
-Go.

1:02:18.375 --> 1:02:20.000
Yep.

1:02:20.083 --> 1:02:21.708
(rain falling)

1:02:21.791 --> 1:02:23.291
It's raining.

1:02:23.375 --> 1:02:24.583
-Your hair gonna be all right?
-(thunder rumbling)

1:02:24.666 --> 1:02:26.041
I'm fine.

1:02:26.125 --> 1:02:30.250
Ever since I started doing this show,
rain bounces off my hair.

1:02:30.333 --> 1:02:32.166
-That's helpful.
-Mm.

1:02:32.250 --> 1:02:34.958
Honestly had no idea this place was here.

1:02:35.041 --> 1:02:37.625
They like to keep a low profile.

1:02:37.708 --> 1:02:39.791
Can't imagine why.

1:02:39.875 --> 1:02:43.166
Kind of people go to a bar
on a Wednesday morning?

1:02:43.250 --> 1:02:45.500
It's an eclectic group.

1:02:45.583 --> 1:02:48.208
-What are you having?
-(“Junker's Blues” playing over radio)

1:02:48.291 --> 1:02:50.083
I'll take a tetanus shot.

1:02:50.166 --> 1:02:52.083
-Jim Beam, two times.
-Sure, Bill.

1:02:52.166 --> 1:02:54.208
(sighs) I thought you and Desi had a deal.

1:02:54.291 --> 1:02:56.791
You don't drink at work.

1:02:56.875 --> 1:02:59.416
Desi and I have a deal
that I won't be drunk at work.

1:02:59.500 --> 1:03:01.625
Have you ever seen me drunk at work?

1:03:01.708 --> 1:03:03.708
-Would I know?
-No.

1:03:03.791 --> 1:03:04.958
Here's to your new baby.

1:03:05.041 --> 1:03:06.458
All right, then.

1:03:07.750 --> 1:03:09.916
Are they being polite
or do they not recognize us?

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:11.583
They don't own television sets.

1:03:13.083 --> 1:03:14.416
Why didn't I think of that?

1:03:14.500 --> 1:03:16.833
Honey, I read seven newspapers every day.

1:03:16.916 --> 1:03:18.833
Seven? When do you have time to do that?

1:03:18.916 --> 1:03:21.666
It's 30 minutes between races
at Santa Anita,

1:03:21.750 --> 1:03:23.708
and it takes me a minute and a half
to pick a horse.

1:03:23.791 --> 1:03:25.333
-Aren't you at work?
-Yeah.

1:03:25.416 --> 1:03:28.291
We have bookies now and telephones.

1:03:28.375 --> 1:03:31.083
Know all about that.
Did a Damon Runyon picture.

1:03:31.166 --> 1:03:33.000
In none of those seven newspapers

1:03:33.083 --> 1:03:36.958
have I read anything about
Lucille Ball being a Communist.

1:03:38.416 --> 1:03:40.791
I don't hear anyone talking about it.

1:03:40.875 --> 1:03:42.458
Since when do you talk to anyone?

1:03:42.541 --> 1:03:44.958
I got news for you: the less you talk,
the more things you hear,

1:03:45.041 --> 1:03:46.875
and I haven't heard anything.

1:03:46.958 --> 1:03:48.916
So…

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.208
problems at home?

1:03:51.750 --> 1:03:53.416
Problems at home?

1:03:53.500 --> 1:03:55.541
-Yeah.
-No.

1:03:55.625 --> 1:04:00.291
I'd like very much to have problems at
home, but my problem's not home that much.

1:04:00.375 --> 1:04:01.458
Few times a week.

1:04:01.541 --> 1:04:02.708
He was playing cards on the boat
Wednesday night.

1:04:02.791 --> 1:04:04.125
I know.

1:04:04.208 --> 1:04:05.458
The picture's six months old.

1:04:05.541 --> 1:04:07.958
I was there when it was taken.

1:04:08.041 --> 1:04:10.541
I'm saying, why wasn't he home,
where I and our daughter were?

1:04:10.625 --> 1:04:14.875
Your husband is in love with America
like no man I have ever known

1:04:14.958 --> 1:04:19.583
since George M. Cohan, who loved America
so much he wrote the same song five times.

1:04:19.666 --> 1:04:20.708
Okay?

1:04:20.791 --> 1:04:24.208
Desi loves America as much as that guy.

1:04:24.291 --> 1:04:26.500
But that doesn't mean he's not Cuban.

1:04:26.583 --> 1:04:28.208
-I know that.
-The world he's from

1:04:28.291 --> 1:04:30.916
has a very narrow definition of manhood.

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.291
-I know that, too.
-The man is the man.

1:04:33.375 --> 1:04:34.416
Mm-hmm.

1:04:34.500 --> 1:04:36.333
And not for nothing,
but the women are happy.

1:04:36.416 --> 1:04:38.208
(scoffs softly) You've asked them?

1:04:38.291 --> 1:04:40.000
They look happy.

1:04:41.083 --> 1:04:42.500
I see.

1:04:44.083 --> 1:04:46.125
-But that's neither here nor there.
-It really isn't.

1:04:46.208 --> 1:04:49.333
He's mesmerized by you, Lucille.

1:04:49.416 --> 1:04:52.500
And he misses you
when you're in two different places.

1:04:52.583 --> 1:04:54.708
He does. I'm a witness.

1:04:54.791 --> 1:04:56.333
-He doesn't have to.
-He…

1:04:56.416 --> 1:04:57.666
We live in the same house.

1:04:57.750 --> 1:04:59.625
He does have to.

1:04:59.708 --> 1:05:00.958
That's what I'm saying.

1:05:02.791 --> 1:05:07.083
He has to spend time away from you
so that he can feel like he's not the…

1:05:07.166 --> 1:05:08.458
Second banana.

1:05:08.541 --> 1:05:11.166
I navigate male egos for a living, bud.

1:05:11.250 --> 1:05:13.333
Then why are you running the set?

1:05:13.416 --> 1:05:15.958
Why are you running rehearsals?

1:05:16.041 --> 1:05:17.666
You're doing it right in front of him.

1:05:17.750 --> 1:05:20.458
I can't prioritize the director's feelings
over the health of the show.

1:05:20.541 --> 1:05:23.500
No, no, not– I couldn't care less
about Donald's feelings if I tried hard.

1:05:23.583 --> 1:05:24.666
He's a hack.

1:05:24.750 --> 1:05:28.916
But we'll overcome that because,
frankly, we're not doing Uncle Vanya.

1:05:30.291 --> 1:05:31.500
Got it.

1:05:31.583 --> 1:05:33.250
But the business at the dinner table
has to be precise.

1:05:33.333 --> 1:05:35.083
Really?

1:05:35.166 --> 1:05:36.708
I was only in vaudeville 40 years,

1:05:36.791 --> 1:05:39.375
so I wouldn't know about these things
of which you speak.

1:05:39.458 --> 1:05:40.500
I know you know.

1:05:40.583 --> 1:05:41.750
I'm just saying…

1:05:41.833 --> 1:05:44.625
You did it in front of Desi is my point.

1:05:45.833 --> 1:05:47.500
Let me tell you something about Desi.

1:05:47.583 --> 1:05:49.416
He runs this show.

1:05:50.500 --> 1:05:53.000
Every creative decision goes through him.

1:05:53.083 --> 1:05:56.083
Every business decision–
the network, Philip Morris.

1:05:56.166 --> 1:05:58.916
And if that wasn't enough,
he is camera-ready on Monday.

1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:02.541
Takes me five days to get a laugh.

1:06:02.625 --> 1:06:04.458
He's killing it at the table read.

1:06:04.541 --> 1:06:06.458
(chuckles softly)

1:06:06.541 --> 1:06:09.708
And that man, believe me,
is nobody's second banana.

1:06:11.083 --> 1:06:12.666
How many people know that?

1:06:12.750 --> 1:06:14.041
Know what?

1:06:14.125 --> 1:06:16.458
That Desi runs the show.

1:06:16.541 --> 1:06:18.541
How many people know that?

1:06:23.250 --> 1:06:24.875
There was a minute there

1:06:24.958 --> 1:06:28.125
when Lucy was gonna be a serious actress.

1:06:28.208 --> 1:06:29.708
In serious movies.

1:06:29.791 --> 1:06:33.583
She was gonna compete for roles
with Crawford, Hayworth.

1:06:35.208 --> 1:06:37.375
Might've been Lucy in All About Eve.

1:06:37.458 --> 1:06:41.041
And you know what?
She'd have blown the doors off the place.

1:06:42.291 --> 1:06:44.875
It was almost like that.

1:06:44.958 --> 1:06:46.250
For a minute there.

1:06:55.666 --> 1:06:57.250
Desi!

1:06:58.708 --> 1:07:00.708
(tuning guitar)

1:07:01.708 --> 1:07:02.708
Desi!

1:07:02.791 --> 1:07:04.125
(pants, grunts)

1:07:04.208 --> 1:07:05.208
Lucy?

1:07:05.291 --> 1:07:06.416
What happened?

1:07:06.500 --> 1:07:08.666
(panting)

1:07:08.750 --> 1:07:10.250
Flat tire!

1:07:10.333 --> 1:07:11.958
Quarter of a mile back.

1:07:12.041 --> 1:07:14.125
And you abandoned the car there?

1:07:14.208 --> 1:07:16.666
-I sprinted the last 500 yards.
-What's going on?

1:07:16.750 --> 1:07:19.166
Also you ran with a bottle
of champagne in your hand?

1:07:19.250 --> 1:07:21.625
(breathlessly):
Bringing it…

1:07:22.875 --> 1:07:23.958
…more festive.

1:07:24.041 --> 1:07:25.041
I got it.

1:07:25.125 --> 1:07:26.583
I got the part.

1:07:26.666 --> 1:07:28.666
-Which part?
-I got the part, Des.

1:07:28.750 --> 1:07:30.125
The Big Street.

1:07:30.208 --> 1:07:32.291
You said it was going to Rita Hayworth.

1:07:32.375 --> 1:07:33.791
Scheduling problems.

1:07:33.875 --> 1:07:35.458
Then they went to Judy Holliday.

1:07:35.541 --> 1:07:37.375
Scheduling problems.

1:07:37.458 --> 1:07:41.708
I got the female lead in The Big Street.

1:07:41.791 --> 1:07:43.958
That's tremendous.

1:07:44.958 --> 1:07:46.041
That's tremendous.

1:07:46.125 --> 1:07:49.000
I'm opposite Henry Fonda.

1:07:49.083 --> 1:07:51.875
But when does it start photography?

1:07:51.958 --> 1:07:52.958
Two weeks.

1:07:53.041 --> 1:07:54.666
(panting continues)

1:07:54.750 --> 1:07:56.916
-I still can't catch my breath.
-(groans)

1:07:58.208 --> 1:08:00.208
-It's Damon Runyon.
-I know!

1:08:00.291 --> 1:08:03.041
I know. I read the script,
and I'm very, I'm very happy, Lucy,

1:08:03.125 --> 1:08:05.458
but I was looking forward
to you coming out on tour.

1:08:07.250 --> 1:08:09.375
Rita Hayworth had scheduling problems.

1:08:09.458 --> 1:08:11.791
Mm, so did you.

1:08:11.875 --> 1:08:15.125
You don't think I want to be in the same
city at the same time as my husband?

1:08:15.208 --> 1:08:16.708
-I know. I know.
-What do I–

1:08:16.791 --> 1:08:18.958
Every decision I make
is based on being near you.

1:08:19.041 --> 1:08:20.916
Every single decision.

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:24.458
Well, yes, but obviously not
every single decision.

1:08:24.541 --> 1:08:26.958
-No? Hmm?
-(sighs)

1:08:27.041 --> 1:08:29.500
You know how many years I've spent
sticking my head into frame,

1:08:29.583 --> 1:08:31.416
saying something bitchy and going away?

1:08:31.500 --> 1:08:34.916
Crappy little roles in pictures
I wouldn't pay a nickel to see

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.916
if the theater had
the only available air-conditioning.

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.416
-Uh-huh.
-If The Big Street is a hit,

1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:45.250
I'll be getting the roles
that go to Rita and Judy and Bette.

1:08:45.333 --> 1:08:46.333
Which Judy?

1:08:46.416 --> 1:08:47.500
-Holliday.
-Ah.

1:08:47.583 --> 1:08:49.291
Who's the baseball player
that you talk about?

1:08:49.375 --> 1:08:52.500
The one who sat down
and let Lou Gehrig start that streak.

1:08:52.583 --> 1:08:54.000
Oh, Wally Pipp.

1:08:54.083 --> 1:08:55.875
Gehrig was his understudy.

1:08:55.958 --> 1:08:58.416
-Backup.
-And the guy took a rest one day.

1:08:58.500 --> 1:09:00.916
Gehrig came in,
didn't come out for 40 years.

1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.416
14 years, and it was Wally Pipp.

1:09:02.500 --> 1:09:05.166
Okay, well, imagine if Wally Pipp
had scheduling problems,

1:09:05.250 --> 1:09:09.833
Lou Gehrig, instead of grabbing his glove,
toured with his husband's Latin orchestra.

1:09:09.916 --> 1:09:11.458
It would've changed
the course of baseball.

1:09:11.541 --> 1:09:13.666
-And the course of Latin music.
-(sighs)

1:09:13.750 --> 1:09:15.541
Rita Hayworth is Wally Pipp.

1:09:15.625 --> 1:09:16.791
I'm Lou Gehrig.

1:09:16.875 --> 1:09:18.500
The Big Street is the Yankees.

1:09:18.583 --> 1:09:20.958
I understood the metaphor so long ago.

1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:25.083
You don't have to tour.
You could stay in town.

1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:29.333
-And do what?
-Sell out Ciro's every night.

1:09:31.291 --> 1:09:34.125
We're not a house band.

1:09:34.208 --> 1:09:36.416
I'd like to sell out New York.

1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:39.291
I'd like to sell out Chicago
and Miami, too.

1:09:39.375 --> 1:09:41.208
-I know.
-Hmm.

1:09:41.291 --> 1:09:42.958
Eight weeks.

1:09:43.041 --> 1:09:45.416
I'll come wherever you are
on the weekends.

1:09:46.625 --> 1:09:48.708
So it'll be important that you not
fall in love with someone else

1:09:48.791 --> 1:09:50.208
Mondays through Fridays.

1:09:50.291 --> 1:09:52.208
Agreed.

1:09:52.291 --> 1:09:53.958
Should we open the champagne,
take our clothes off

1:09:54.041 --> 1:09:55.458
and go skinny-dipping in the pool?

1:09:55.541 --> 1:09:57.750
That bottle of champagne
is basically a grenade now,

1:09:57.833 --> 1:09:59.583
but all your other ideas were good.

1:09:59.666 --> 1:10:02.875
Lucy, Lucy, Jesus.

1:10:02.958 --> 1:10:04.208
Wow.

1:10:04.291 --> 1:10:05.666
You're gonna be a movie star.

1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:09.708
You comfortable with that?

1:10:10.958 --> 1:10:13.458
Am I comfortable with that?

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:25.541
That bottle has comic timing.

1:10:36.375 --> 1:10:38.750
I've been at the studio
for almost ten years.

1:10:38.833 --> 1:10:40.500
I've never been in the president's office.

1:10:40.583 --> 1:10:43.708
Mr. Koerner isn't the president.
He's the head of production.

1:10:44.791 --> 1:10:46.875
Second in command.

1:10:46.958 --> 1:10:48.583
Still higher than I've ever gotten.

1:10:48.666 --> 1:10:51.125
(intercom buzzes)

1:10:51.208 --> 1:10:53.041
-Yes, sir.
-Send her in.

1:10:53.125 --> 1:10:54.291
You can go on in.

1:10:59.666 --> 1:11:01.375
-Lucille.
-(sighs)

1:11:01.458 --> 1:11:03.625
-Charles Koerner.
-Lucille Ball. (chuckles)

1:11:03.708 --> 1:11:05.416
You like Lucille or Lucy?

1:11:05.500 --> 1:11:07.125
Lucy's fine. I mean either's fine.

1:11:07.208 --> 1:11:08.750
-Lucy.
-All right.

1:11:08.833 --> 1:11:10.708
And do I call you Charlie?

1:11:10.791 --> 1:11:12.791
Anyone as brilliant as you were
in The Big Street

1:11:12.875 --> 1:11:14.583
can call me Betsy and I wouldn't care.

1:11:14.666 --> 1:11:16.250
(laughs) Thank you.

1:11:16.333 --> 1:11:18.333
Please, sit. Sit here.

1:11:19.583 --> 1:11:20.583
(Lucille sighs)

1:11:21.625 --> 1:11:23.208
Thank you.

1:11:23.291 --> 1:11:24.333
(sighs heavily)

1:11:24.416 --> 1:11:27.375
That was a whole new side of you
we've never seen.

1:11:27.458 --> 1:11:28.625
Where's that been?

1:11:28.708 --> 1:11:30.875
-It's been buried under bad movies.
-(laughs)

1:11:30.958 --> 1:11:33.583
I've heard you make
some form of that joke before.

1:11:33.666 --> 1:11:37.000
Keep putting me in pictures like
The Big Street, you won't hear it again.

1:11:39.291 --> 1:11:41.375
We're dropping your contract, Lucy.

1:11:41.458 --> 1:11:43.500
(laughs)

1:11:43.583 --> 1:11:45.583
-No, it-it's not a joke.
-That was…

1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:50.000
RKO is dropping your contract.

1:11:52.291 --> 1:11:53.875
I don't understand.

1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000
We don't have anything for you.

1:11:59.250 --> 1:12:01.458
But that…

1:12:01.541 --> 1:12:02.833
(exhales sharply)

1:12:06.083 --> 1:12:07.666
This is happening fast.

1:12:07.750 --> 1:12:08.916
The Big Street was a hit.

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.583
It was a critical hit.

1:12:10.666 --> 1:12:12.625
I get that there wasn't
a stampede to the box office,

1:12:12.708 --> 1:12:14.000
but you didn't lose money, did you?

1:12:14.083 --> 1:12:16.250
-No.
-Do you understand the conditions

1:12:16.333 --> 1:12:18.583
under which this picture was finished?

1:12:18.666 --> 1:12:19.791
No, it has nothing to do
with conditions…

1:12:19.875 --> 1:12:22.625
Damon Runyon left town
before principal photography,

1:12:22.708 --> 1:12:25.791
our director joined the Army
during postproduction,

1:12:25.875 --> 1:12:28.833
and our editor died.

1:12:28.916 --> 1:12:31.083
He just flat-out died.

1:12:31.166 --> 1:12:33.458
-There were a number of obstacles.
-That's accurate.

1:12:33.541 --> 1:12:35.666
-Did you read the reviews?
-They were very impressive.

1:12:35.750 --> 1:12:37.041
They were more than impressive.

1:12:37.125 --> 1:12:40.000
This has nothing to do with
your performance in The Big Street.

1:12:40.083 --> 1:12:43.125
But it should have everything to do
with my performance in The Big Street.

1:12:43.208 --> 1:12:47.666
I… I showed what I can do, and that's
just the beginning of what I can do.

1:12:47.750 --> 1:12:49.458
That is just the beginning of it.

1:12:49.541 --> 1:12:51.833
(Lucille sighs)

1:12:52.916 --> 1:12:54.666
Are you sure this isn't a joke?

1:12:54.750 --> 1:12:56.375
It's a tough business.

1:12:56.458 --> 1:12:57.500
I know that!

1:12:57.583 --> 1:12:59.666
I've been in it since I was 14!

1:12:59.750 --> 1:13:01.375
But you're 35 now.

1:13:03.416 --> 1:13:05.458
-And that is the problem?
-No.

1:13:05.541 --> 1:13:08.625
The problem is you're really 39,
aren't you?

1:13:10.041 --> 1:13:11.333
Hmm.

1:13:11.416 --> 1:13:15.000
39-year-olds don't go to see your movies?

1:13:16.083 --> 1:13:18.375
They don't want to see stories
about themselves?

1:13:18.458 --> 1:13:22.500
You came through for us when Judy Holliday
and Rita Hayworth were on other pictures,

1:13:22.583 --> 1:13:24.875
and we didn't want to lose Fonda.

1:13:24.958 --> 1:13:28.333
Now, this studio has a handshake
understanding with Metro and Warner,

1:13:28.416 --> 1:13:31.083
and they'll loan us Holliday or Hayworth,

1:13:31.166 --> 1:13:35.500
so we just don't have enough for you
to warrant keeping you under contract.

1:13:35.583 --> 1:13:38.541
Judy Holliday does one thing very well,
but it's just one thing.

1:13:38.625 --> 1:13:40.333
I know how you're feeling right now.

1:13:40.416 --> 1:13:43.708
I've had to have this conversation
a hundred times.

1:13:43.791 --> 1:13:46.416
I'm surprised
because you're terrible at it.

1:13:47.875 --> 1:13:49.291
Can I make a suggestion?

1:13:50.875 --> 1:13:52.166
Radio.

1:13:53.791 --> 1:13:55.375
The hell did you just say to me?

1:13:55.458 --> 1:13:57.333
You've got the voice for it.

1:13:57.416 --> 1:13:59.833
Look, I've noticed there's a lot
you can do with your voice.

1:13:59.916 --> 1:14:02.208
You should think about radio, Lucy.

1:14:05.541 --> 1:14:07.833
And you should go fuck yourself, Betsy.

1:14:11.250 --> 1:14:13.250
(crickets chirping)

1:14:22.916 --> 1:14:24.208
(sighs softly)

1:14:27.916 --> 1:14:29.416
Lucy?

1:14:30.708 --> 1:14:32.416
What are you doing?

1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:34.625
I'm reading scripts.

1:14:36.166 --> 1:14:39.375
Oh, it's00 in the morning.

1:14:39.458 --> 1:14:41.708
I know.

1:14:41.791 --> 1:14:43.583
I'm drunk, too.

1:14:44.583 --> 1:14:46.250
I know why you like drinking.

1:14:46.333 --> 1:14:49.083
I didn't get it till about two hours ago.

1:14:50.875 --> 1:14:52.875
You read any good movies?

1:14:52.958 --> 1:14:55.291
These are radio pilots.

1:14:55.375 --> 1:14:57.250
Oh, yeah?

1:14:57.333 --> 1:14:58.375
Yeah.

1:14:58.458 --> 1:15:01.625
There's nothing wrong with radio.

1:15:01.708 --> 1:15:02.958
I do it all the time.

1:15:03.041 --> 1:15:04.875
You're a bandleader.

1:15:17.083 --> 1:15:19.375
You know, Bataan was a hit, too.

1:15:20.541 --> 1:15:21.625
I didn't hear you.

1:15:21.708 --> 1:15:23.750
Bataan was a hit.

1:15:23.833 --> 1:15:26.208
I was good.

1:15:26.291 --> 1:15:29.041
The reviews were valentines,
and I didn't bang a drum.

1:15:30.125 --> 1:15:32.250
It would have led to better parts,
except I had to go to–

1:15:32.333 --> 1:15:34.166
what do you call it?–

1:15:34.250 --> 1:15:37.041
fight World War II.

1:15:39.416 --> 1:15:42.541
And now those crappy little parts in
pictures you wouldn't pay a nickel to see

1:15:42.625 --> 1:15:45.708
-if it was the only available
air-conditioning in the… -Des.

1:15:45.791 --> 1:15:47.791
I can't get them.

1:15:57.333 --> 1:15:58.750
(sighs softly)

1:16:13.416 --> 1:16:15.583
Gee, honey, are you sure
those bandages are fake?

1:16:15.666 --> 1:16:18.000
-Oh, yeah.
-Are you sure you're all right?

1:16:18.083 --> 1:16:20.541
-Yeah, honey, I'm fine.
-Oh, yeah– oh, let me help you.

1:16:20.625 --> 1:16:21.625
(groans):
Oh.

1:16:21.708 --> 1:16:24.708
It's a good thing
the Mertzes had their awning up.

1:16:24.791 --> 1:16:26.208
-Oh, honey.
-(groans)

1:16:26.291 --> 1:16:28.583
It was all my fault.

1:16:28.666 --> 1:16:30.958
No, it was my fault, honey.

1:16:31.041 --> 1:16:32.250
Weren't we silly?

1:16:32.333 --> 1:16:34.000
Yes. We will never argue again.

1:16:34.083 --> 1:16:36.083
Ah, baby.

1:16:37.375 --> 1:16:40.458
-Lucy, are you okay?!
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1:16:40.541 --> 1:16:41.958
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

1:16:42.041 --> 1:16:43.500
Thank goodness you're all right.

1:16:43.583 --> 1:16:44.833
Why? What's the matter?

1:16:44.916 --> 1:16:47.125
When I told Ethel
the whole gag was my idea,

1:16:47.208 --> 1:16:48.875
she got mad and went home to her mother.

1:16:48.958 --> 1:16:50.541
-Oh…!
-Oh, no.

1:16:50.625 --> 1:16:52.250
And we cut. Good.

1:16:52.333 --> 1:16:53.541
-Is that lunch?
-(indistinct chatter)

1:16:53.625 --> 1:16:54.958
That's one hour for lunch!

1:16:55.041 --> 1:16:57.250
We'll do notes onstage after and go again.

1:16:57.333 --> 1:16:59.208
Uh, one quick thing.

1:16:59.291 --> 1:17:00.625
The table scene is getting good.

1:17:00.708 --> 1:17:01.708
Yeah, it's not.

1:17:01.791 --> 1:17:03.541
I wanted to circle back again and express

1:17:03.625 --> 1:17:06.458
my serious concern about
Ricky's entrance at the top.

1:17:06.541 --> 1:17:09.208
I brought it up at the table read Monday.
There haven't been new pages.

1:17:09.291 --> 1:17:11.083
-Because it's gonna work.
-Hear me out.

1:17:11.166 --> 1:17:12.666
-Okay.
-Right now,

1:17:12.750 --> 1:17:14.416
Lucy is trimming the flowers on the table.

1:17:14.500 --> 1:17:16.416
Ricky opens the door and comes in.

1:17:16.500 --> 1:17:18.166
We're gonna have to cut the flowers.

1:17:18.250 --> 1:17:21.000
I don't mean “cut the flowers.”
I mean cut the flowers.

1:17:21.083 --> 1:17:23.833
I couldn't understand the difference
between those two line readings.

1:17:23.916 --> 1:17:26.250
We're running long.
We have to cut the bit with the flowers.

1:17:26.333 --> 1:17:27.458
How long?

1:17:27.541 --> 1:17:28.791
About a minute.

1:17:28.875 --> 1:17:31.125
All right, well,
we'll get back to the flowers.

1:17:31.208 --> 1:17:33.541
The front door opens, Ricky comes in.

1:17:33.625 --> 1:17:35.333
Lucy doesn't see or hear him,
which is unusual

1:17:35.416 --> 1:17:37.208
because the front door is, you know,

1:17:37.291 --> 1:17:38.583
-right there.
-Mm-hmm.

1:17:38.666 --> 1:17:40.291
And in previous episodes,
we've established

1:17:40.375 --> 1:17:42.250
Lucy's eyes and ears
are connected to her brain.

1:17:42.333 --> 1:17:44.083
We-we buy the conceit.

1:17:44.166 --> 1:17:46.500
-I'm sorry?
-We buy it.

1:17:46.583 --> 1:17:49.500
Lucy is so focused
on making the table nice

1:17:49.583 --> 1:17:51.708
she doesn't even notice
Ricky coming in the door.

1:17:51.791 --> 1:17:53.500
-Okay, I'll run with that.
-Yeah.

1:17:53.583 --> 1:17:55.208
Ricky walks up to her quietly.

1:17:55.291 --> 1:17:57.791
He puts his hands
over her eyes and says…

1:17:57.875 --> 1:17:59.500
“Guess who it is.”

1:17:59.583 --> 1:18:03.125
-And then Lucy says,
“Bill? Sam? Pat? Ralph?” -Yeah.

1:18:03.208 --> 1:18:04.666
-She's teasing him.
-Yes, she's teasing him.

1:18:04.750 --> 1:18:06.208
That's clear. Ricky responds…

1:18:06.291 --> 1:18:07.583
-“No.”
-“No.”

1:18:07.666 --> 1:18:10.875
And the stage direction for Ricky
says “burning.”

1:18:10.958 --> 1:18:11.958
“No!”

1:18:12.041 --> 1:18:13.333
He's upset.

1:18:13.416 --> 1:18:14.833
Lucy continues the teasing.

1:18:14.916 --> 1:18:16.750
“George? Julius? Stephen? Ivan?”

1:18:16.833 --> 1:18:18.333
-Yeah.
-We changed that to

1:18:18.416 --> 1:18:19.708
“Pedro? Julio? Juan? Guillermo?”

1:18:19.791 --> 1:18:21.250
“Because those are Spanish names.

1:18:21.333 --> 1:18:23.708
“I mean Mexican. Cuban. Latin.

1:18:23.791 --> 1:18:25.208
“They're Brazilian names.

1:18:25.291 --> 1:18:26.875
Turkish.”

1:18:26.958 --> 1:18:28.291
-You done? -Yeah. -
We're moving into a meal penalty.

1:18:28.375 --> 1:18:29.500
Yeah, okay.

1:18:29.583 --> 1:18:30.958
Lucy guesses some names.

1:18:31.041 --> 1:18:32.166
Yeah, teasingly.

1:18:32.250 --> 1:18:36.958
And the script indicates that Ricky
takes his hands away from Lucy's eyes,

1:18:37.041 --> 1:18:38.541
turns her around and says…

1:18:38.625 --> 1:18:42.041
-“No, it's me.”
-So my question again,

1:18:42.125 --> 1:18:46.416
Does Ricky honestly, truly believe
that there might be eight different men

1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:51.750
who routinely walk into their apartment,
all of whom sound exactly like Desi Arnaz?

1:18:52.833 --> 1:18:54.666
You think we're saying Ricky's stupid?

1:18:54.750 --> 1:18:56.625
I think you're saying the audience is.

1:18:56.708 --> 1:18:59.416
And that's something for which
they won't soon forgive you.

1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:01.291
You charge for these lessons?

1:19:01.375 --> 1:19:02.416
A ton.

1:19:02.500 --> 1:19:05.875
For the sake of the joke,
the audience will take the leap with us.

1:19:05.958 --> 1:19:08.833
They will, but you'll need a busload
of orthopedists when they land.

1:19:08.916 --> 1:19:09.916
Jess.

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.708
Let's talk about this after lunch, huh?

1:19:11.791 --> 1:19:13.666
-I have an idea.
-I got a crew here,

1:19:13.750 --> 1:19:15.125
and we're about
to run into a penalty, so…

1:19:15.208 --> 1:19:18.333
-Lucy is working on the flowers.
-We're cutting the flowers for time.

1:19:18.416 --> 1:19:19.833
I don't mean literally
cutting the flowers in the scene…

1:19:19.916 --> 1:19:21.583
I cannot go through that again.

1:19:21.666 --> 1:19:23.208
Ricky opens the door, comes in,

1:19:23.291 --> 1:19:26.416
shuts the door, as we've seen him do
in 37 episodes.

1:19:26.500 --> 1:19:28.250
Lucy doesn't acknowledge him.

1:19:28.333 --> 1:19:30.041
-Uh, so far, you're describing the script.
-Right.

1:19:30.125 --> 1:19:32.375
But instead of playing
the hands-over-the-eyes guessing game,

1:19:32.458 --> 1:19:34.333
Ricky just stands there.

1:19:34.416 --> 1:19:37.833
He can't understand why Lucy doesn't
notice he's home any more than we can.

1:19:37.916 --> 1:19:41.208
He stands there for a full beat,
and then another,

1:19:41.291 --> 1:19:45.083
and then merrily,
in a slightly exaggerated manner,

1:19:45.166 --> 1:19:48.208
as we've heard him do
a hundred times, he says…

1:19:48.291 --> 1:19:50.250
“Lucy, I'm home!”

1:19:50.333 --> 1:19:51.625
(laughter)

1:19:51.708 --> 1:19:53.708
For Ricky is funny.

1:19:53.791 --> 1:19:55.500
Hey, Luce?

1:19:55.583 --> 1:19:57.875
Let's talk about it after lunch.

1:19:59.541 --> 1:20:01.416
-Jim.
-That's lunch!

1:20:01.500 --> 1:20:02.583
One hour!

1:20:02.666 --> 1:20:04.666
Back onstage for notes!

1:20:04.750 --> 1:20:06.500
-All right, lunch!
-(indistinct chatter)

1:20:10.458 --> 1:20:11.666
Hang on!

1:20:11.750 --> 1:20:13.458
Desi, does that work for you?

1:20:13.541 --> 1:20:15.166
Works perfect.

1:20:16.250 --> 1:20:18.250
We'll talk about it after lunch.

1:20:20.166 --> 1:20:22.041
It needed to be fixed.

1:20:32.333 --> 1:20:33.833
I think we can get more
out of “hypocrite.”

1:20:33.916 --> 1:20:35.583
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Like what?

1:20:35.666 --> 1:20:38.333
Like Lucy turns to Desi and says,

1:20:38.416 --> 1:20:40.708
“Well, it's nice to know
I'm married to a hypocrite.”

1:20:40.791 --> 1:20:42.666
And Desi gets his back up and says…

1:20:42.750 --> 1:20:44.041
“Hypocrite?”

1:20:44.125 --> 1:20:46.375
Then turns to Fred and says,
“What's a hypocrite?”

1:20:46.458 --> 1:20:48.750
Fred tells him,
“It's a person who says one thing

1:20:48.833 --> 1:20:50.208
-but does another.”
-Mm-hmm.

1:20:50.291 --> 1:20:52.541
Desi says, “Thank you,”
turns back to Lucy and says…

1:20:52.625 --> 1:20:54.708
-“Oh, yeah?” (chuckles)
-Yeah, that's good. That's good.

1:20:54.791 --> 1:20:56.500
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was gonna pitch.

1:20:56.583 --> 1:20:58.541
-But I pitched it faster.
-By interrupting me.

1:20:58.625 --> 1:21:00.166
How do you think I got to be
a woman in a comedy room?

1:21:00.250 --> 1:21:01.250
(knocking)

1:21:01.333 --> 1:21:02.833
Hey, is now a good time?

1:21:02.916 --> 1:21:04.083
Yeah. Madelyn had a good idea.

1:21:04.166 --> 1:21:07.833
Desi's entrance, we shoot it both ways
and see which one gets the bigger laugh.

1:21:07.916 --> 1:21:09.208
That was my idea.

1:21:09.291 --> 1:21:10.833
It's a bad idea.

1:21:10.916 --> 1:21:12.250
Mm. It's just not your day.

1:21:12.333 --> 1:21:14.291
-Can I have a minute in your office?
-Yeah.

1:21:14.375 --> 1:21:15.625
Sure.

1:21:15.708 --> 1:21:17.458
(sighs):
All right.

1:21:17.541 --> 1:21:18.958
(phone ringing in distance)

1:21:19.041 --> 1:21:21.416
What's wrong with shooting it both ways?

1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:23.875
You'll be on the floor
during the show, right?

1:21:23.958 --> 1:21:25.458
I'll be where I always am.

1:21:25.541 --> 1:21:27.291
In full view of the audience?

1:21:27.375 --> 1:21:28.875
I suppose.

1:21:28.958 --> 1:21:30.375
Since we're doing it both ways,

1:21:30.458 --> 1:21:33.458
how about we do it once with your pants on
and once with your pants off?

1:21:33.541 --> 1:21:35.458
-That's not the same.
-It is.

1:21:35.541 --> 1:21:39.166
And I don't want to do the version
with my pants off in front of 200 people.

1:21:39.250 --> 1:21:42.125
But that's not what I need
to talk to you about.

1:21:42.208 --> 1:21:44.208
You're not gonna tell me
you're pregnant again, are you?

1:21:44.291 --> 1:21:47.333
No.
I'm still pregnant from before, but no.

1:21:47.416 --> 1:21:50.125
Jess, you know how much I value you.

1:21:50.208 --> 1:21:52.333
-I think I do.
-You know you do.

1:21:52.416 --> 1:21:53.500
Okay.

1:21:53.583 --> 1:21:55.708
And you also know what it is
Desi does around here.

1:21:55.791 --> 1:21:57.458
Sure.

1:21:57.541 --> 1:22:00.125
-I mean, every business decision
goes through Desi. -Mm-hmm.

1:22:00.208 --> 1:22:03.208
In fact, most business decisions
are made by Desi.

1:22:03.291 --> 1:22:06.083
-You married a very bright man.
-I did.

1:22:06.166 --> 1:22:08.458
He makes a lot of creative decisions, too.

1:22:08.541 --> 1:22:10.500
Mm. I'm not sure I'd say a lot.

1:22:10.583 --> 1:22:11.791
I would. I'd say a lot.

1:22:11.875 --> 1:22:13.625
He devised the camera system that we use.

1:22:13.708 --> 1:22:16.625
He's the reason the East Coast
doesn't see the show on a foggy kinescope.

1:22:16.708 --> 1:22:18.583
-Yeah.
-And even though we use three cameras,

1:22:18.666 --> 1:22:20.916
the studio audience can see every scene.

1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.916
-That's him, too.
-Mm-hmm.

1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:24.500
And the four of us, the cast,
we can see the audience.

1:22:24.583 --> 1:22:25.708
I give him a lot of credit for that.

1:22:25.791 --> 1:22:29.166
He's the one who thought up
Lucy being pregnant on the show.

1:22:30.250 --> 1:22:32.791
That is never gonna happen,
'cause no matter what CBS says,

1:22:32.875 --> 1:22:34.125
Philip Morris is never
gonna let it happen.

1:22:34.208 --> 1:22:36.125
But, like I said, I give him credit.

1:22:36.208 --> 1:22:38.708
That's the thing, though. You don't.

1:22:38.791 --> 1:22:39.958
What do you mean?

1:22:40.041 --> 1:22:42.291
He doesn't get credit
as an executive producer,

1:22:42.375 --> 1:22:44.750
which, let's face it, is what he is.

1:22:44.833 --> 1:22:47.125
-(sighs)
-You get sole credit.

1:22:47.208 --> 1:22:49.708
I didn't win my credit in a raffle!
I earn it.

1:22:49.791 --> 1:22:52.625
I'm the showrunner! Not to mention
being the creator of the show.

1:22:52.708 --> 1:22:54.833
I don't see how we could
do the show without you.

1:22:54.916 --> 1:22:56.083
You absolutely could not.

1:22:56.166 --> 1:22:59.000
I don't see how we could do the show
without Desi either.

1:22:59.083 --> 1:23:02.083
Because he plays Ricky,
which he does get a screen credit for.

1:23:02.166 --> 1:23:03.625
-Jess… -Is this something
our agents should be talking about?

1:23:03.708 --> 1:23:06.041
-No. -'Cause I'm not at all comfortable
with this conversation.

1:23:06.125 --> 1:23:08.375
I'm about to make you less comfortable.

1:23:09.416 --> 1:23:11.666
I need you to help me save my marriage.

1:23:14.250 --> 1:23:17.083
I need you to help me save my marriage.

1:23:25.083 --> 1:23:27.541
What do you think
they're talking about in there?

1:23:27.625 --> 1:23:30.375
I think they're talking about you.

1:23:30.458 --> 1:23:33.291
I think they want to pay you less
because you're not as funny as I am.

1:23:33.375 --> 1:23:35.791
Mary Pat, would you mind asking Desi
if I can come see him?

1:23:35.875 --> 1:23:37.291
Sure.

1:23:37.375 --> 1:23:39.083
(door closes)

1:23:39.166 --> 1:23:40.500
Madelyn?

1:23:40.583 --> 1:23:41.583
Yeah.

1:23:42.625 --> 1:23:44.625
(phone ringing in distance)

1:23:48.291 --> 1:23:50.833
-Was everything all right in there?
-Yeah.

1:23:50.916 --> 1:23:52.000
-So, listen.
-Mm-hmm.

1:23:52.083 --> 1:23:55.041
It has to be coherent, because if it's
anything goes, then nothing's funny.

1:23:55.125 --> 1:23:57.833
-Anything Goes was a hit.
-Not Cole Porter's Anything Goes.

1:23:57.916 --> 1:23:59.750
-I mean if an…
-I know.

1:23:59.833 --> 1:24:01.750
-Why are you telling me?
-The opening,

1:24:01.833 --> 1:24:04.625
Ricky's entrance with his hands
over my eyes, that was Jess, right?

1:24:06.583 --> 1:24:11.041
Outside of that room, we make it a point
not to talk about who wrote what.

1:24:11.125 --> 1:24:12.708
It wasn't Jess?

1:24:12.791 --> 1:24:13.833
Again…

1:24:13.916 --> 1:24:15.250
You know I'm right about the logic.

1:24:15.333 --> 1:24:19.166
Why aren't you backing me up instead of
endorsing a plan to shoot it both ways?

1:24:19.250 --> 1:24:22.291
Listen, why don't we get together
for a drink or a swim this weekend,

1:24:22.375 --> 1:24:23.916
and we can put it on the agenda?

1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:27.416
Because the show is tomorrow
and I'm fine talking about it now.

1:24:27.500 --> 1:24:30.166
By all means, let's unnecessarily add more
to what you're worried about this week.

1:24:30.250 --> 1:24:32.500
-I'm not worried! I'm…
-Shh.

1:24:32.583 --> 1:24:33.791
(hushed):
I'm not worried.

1:24:33.875 --> 1:24:36.666
I'm saying I count on you
to be the firewall, to be–

1:24:36.750 --> 1:24:40.500
to-to make sure– just– logic, okay?

1:24:40.583 --> 1:24:42.833
I won't say who wrote what,
but I can tell you

1:24:42.916 --> 1:24:45.000
that I'm the lady in there
trying to make Lucy smarter.

1:24:45.083 --> 1:24:46.166
Excuse me?

1:24:46.250 --> 1:24:48.791
I'm the one trying, every week, to…

1:24:48.875 --> 1:24:50.583
Lucy's dumb?

1:24:50.666 --> 1:24:51.875
I didn't say that.

1:24:51.958 --> 1:24:54.208
You're trying…

1:24:54.291 --> 1:24:58.125
struggling, it sounds like–
to make Lucy smarter?

1:24:58.208 --> 1:25:00.541
I created this character with you.
(chuckles softly)

1:25:00.625 --> 1:25:02.416
And she needs to be smarter?

1:25:02.500 --> 1:25:07.166
She sometimes, for the sake of comedy,
is infantilized.

1:25:08.458 --> 1:25:10.666
-(exhales sharply)
-This is a crazy week,

1:25:10.750 --> 1:25:12.791
time and place to be having
this conversation.

1:25:12.875 --> 1:25:15.125
-This is important…
-How is she infantilized?

1:25:15.208 --> 1:25:16.750
She literally says, “Waah.”

1:25:16.833 --> 1:25:18.750
'Cause when she does,
60 million people laugh,

1:25:18.833 --> 1:25:22.125
just like with Lou Costello
and Stan Laurel, and you get paid.

1:25:22.208 --> 1:25:25.041
When those two grown men
play slow-witted five-year-olds, I cringe.

1:25:25.125 --> 1:25:26.875
Then I question your comedy IQ.

1:25:26.958 --> 1:25:28.375
No, you don't.

1:25:28.458 --> 1:25:29.750
You think I'm the funniest writer
in the room,

1:25:29.833 --> 1:25:32.250
and that's why
you're talking to me and not Jess.

1:25:35.666 --> 1:25:37.333
Many people regard Lucy as clever.

1:25:37.416 --> 1:25:39.625
I mean, she always has a plan
to overcome an obstacle.

1:25:39.708 --> 1:25:43.375
Yeah, but oftentimes that obstacle
is her husband's permission.

1:25:43.458 --> 1:25:47.958
You really think, this week, right now,
is the best time to talk about this?

1:25:48.041 --> 1:25:51.625
-No! I literally said that 30 seconds ago.
-(sighs)

1:25:52.625 --> 1:25:54.541
Look…

1:25:54.625 --> 1:25:58.208
it's just a female perspective
from another generation.

1:25:58.291 --> 1:26:00.083
Another generation?

1:26:00.166 --> 1:26:02.000
Ah, you're on a roll.

1:26:02.083 --> 1:26:04.916
Bette Davis, Bacall, Hepburn.

1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.333
-Funny women.
-Judy Holliday.

1:26:06.416 --> 1:26:08.041
Judy Holliday? Go to hell.

1:26:08.125 --> 1:26:09.625
They are funny women.

1:26:09.708 --> 1:26:12.208
And they're smart and tough
and they outsmart the men.

1:26:12.291 --> 1:26:13.666
So why do you and Gracie Allen
feel like you have to…

1:26:13.750 --> 1:26:15.250
Oh, stop. Okay.

1:26:15.333 --> 1:26:16.500
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1:26:16.583 --> 1:26:18.458
Maddie, I love you.

1:26:18.541 --> 1:26:19.916
You're like, I guess,

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.583
-a great-granddaughter to me
from another generation. -Hmm.

1:26:22.666 --> 1:26:25.208
And my fervent wish for you
is that, one day,

1:26:25.291 --> 1:26:26.791
you will be half as funny as Gracie Allen.

1:26:26.875 --> 1:26:31.166
In the meantime, please remember
that Lucy and Ricky and Fred and Ethel,

1:26:31.250 --> 1:26:34.000
if they live past tomorrow,
have to live in a reality

1:26:34.083 --> 1:26:36.458
that accepts the physical laws
of the universe.

1:26:36.541 --> 1:26:38.208
Ricky knows that Lucy doesn't believe

1:26:38.291 --> 1:26:40.791
there are possibly eight other men
in the apartment!

1:26:40.875 --> 1:26:42.083
Understood.

1:26:42.166 --> 1:26:43.458
(sighs heavily)

1:26:43.541 --> 1:26:45.083
But I don't make that decision.

1:26:45.166 --> 1:26:46.375
(door opens)

1:26:46.458 --> 1:26:48.166
Let's go!

1:26:49.625 --> 1:26:51.000
(sighs)

1:26:53.416 --> 1:26:54.916
Mary Pat, cut the flowers.

1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:56.500
And to be clear,
by “cut the flowers,” I mean…

1:26:56.583 --> 1:26:59.000
-She knows exactly what you mean.
-Yeah, let's go.

1:27:00.750 --> 1:27:02.458
(mutters):
Judy Holliday.

1:27:03.500 --> 1:27:04.833
This isn't happening.

1:27:06.458 --> 1:27:07.750
(clears throat)

1:27:11.625 --> 1:27:14.250
-(knocking)
-Mr. Arnaz?

1:27:14.333 --> 1:27:16.000
Come in.

1:27:16.083 --> 1:27:18.750
Mr. Oppenheimer is here to see you
with Mr. Carroll and Miss Pugh.

1:27:18.833 --> 1:27:21.333
Uh, nothing from Mr. Lyons yet?

1:27:21.416 --> 1:27:22.375
No.

1:27:22.458 --> 1:27:23.625
(sighs)

1:27:23.708 --> 1:27:25.291
Anyone at Philip Morris?

1:27:25.375 --> 1:27:26.708
No.

1:27:31.833 --> 1:27:33.750
Gracias.

1:27:33.833 --> 1:27:36.166
-(phone ringing)
-Acompáñame al escenario.

1:27:36.250 --> 1:27:38.083
Walk me to the stage.
We're an hour behind.

1:27:38.166 --> 1:27:40.041
Okay, Madelyn's got a new joke
for the second act.

1:27:40.125 --> 1:27:42.875
I just this minute told Lucy
that we don't talk about who wrote what.

1:27:42.958 --> 1:27:45.000
Madelyn came up with the joke
just seconds after I did.

1:27:45.083 --> 1:27:47.791
Isn't it possible that two comedy writers
working on the same script

1:27:47.875 --> 1:27:49.250
came up with the same joke
at the same time?

1:27:49.333 --> 1:27:50.416
-It's possible.
-Thank you.

1:27:50.500 --> 1:27:52.708
-Just not what happened.
-Do I need to be here for any of this?

1:27:52.791 --> 1:27:55.000
Uh, “Hypocrite? What's a hypocrite?”

1:27:55.083 --> 1:27:57.791
-So that's to Fred.
-Got it. Good.

1:27:57.875 --> 1:27:59.333
-Is that what you wanted me for?
-Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

1:27:59.416 --> 1:28:01.958
The hypocrite joke is for episode nine.
That's the script we're working on, okay?

1:28:02.041 --> 1:28:03.958
If Lucy's gonna be pregnant–
Lucy Ricardo–

1:28:04.041 --> 1:28:06.375
then we have to introduce it in nine,
according to your timetable.

1:28:06.458 --> 1:28:09.541
-Yeah. -So I just want to confirm that
there's no chance we're doing that, right?

1:28:09.625 --> 1:28:11.333
We are doing that.

1:28:11.416 --> 1:28:13.166
You know Philip Morris won't let us.

1:28:13.250 --> 1:28:15.375
And-and even if they did,
we don't want to see this girl pregnant.

1:28:15.458 --> 1:28:16.583
We don't want to know that she's pregnant.

1:28:16.666 --> 1:28:17.833
We don't want to know
how she got pregnant.

1:28:17.916 --> 1:28:20.833
Do we have viewers who don't know
how women get pregnant?

1:28:20.916 --> 1:28:22.416
Yeah, they're called children.

1:28:22.500 --> 1:28:25.375
Uh, do any of these children have
younger brothers or sisters?

1:28:25.458 --> 1:28:28.208
You know what, you know what else
a lot of our viewers are? Christian.

1:28:28.291 --> 1:28:30.083
Ah, I'm way ahead of you.

1:28:30.166 --> 1:28:35.708
I'm going to have a priest, a minister
and a rabbi review every script.

1:28:35.791 --> 1:28:37.916
I'm gonna get rewritten by
a priest, a minister and a rabbi?

1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.666
-Mm-hmm.
-A joke in there somewhere.

1:28:39.750 --> 1:28:41.916
Good, because if I'm rewritten
by a priest, a minister and a rabbi,

1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:43.208
there aren't gonna be many
left in the script.

1:28:43.291 --> 1:28:44.541
-(laughs) Good one.
-Uh, Des…

1:28:44.625 --> 1:28:46.083
No, no, e-enough. Enough.

1:28:46.166 --> 1:28:48.083
I sent a telegram to Alfred Lyons.

1:28:48.166 --> 1:28:49.291
-You did.
-Yes.

1:28:49.375 --> 1:28:50.791
And I've put the decision in his hands.

1:28:50.875 --> 1:28:52.833
-Okay. Okay.
-All right.

1:28:52.916 --> 1:28:54.250
(chuckles):
Okay, good.

1:28:54.333 --> 1:28:57.000
-You're that sure he's gonna say no, huh?
-I am.

1:28:57.083 --> 1:28:59.083
-That it? Okay.
-Mm-hmm. -Yeah.

1:28:59.166 --> 1:29:02.333
Oh, Bob, Bob, tell Desi that thing
you were saying before.

1:29:03.416 --> 1:29:04.500
Me?

1:29:04.583 --> 1:29:06.625
Yeah.

1:29:06.708 --> 1:29:08.333
-Really?
-Guys.

1:29:08.416 --> 1:29:09.958
No, it was interesting.

1:29:10.041 --> 1:29:11.666
-Bob was saying that you…
-Hmm?

1:29:11.750 --> 1:29:13.791
…are really the title character
of the show.

1:29:13.875 --> 1:29:17.708
Because you are the “I” in I Love Lucy.

1:29:18.916 --> 1:29:20.375
Mm-hmm.

1:29:20.458 --> 1:29:21.875
So strictly speaking,
you have top billing.

1:29:22.958 --> 1:29:25.250
I am the “I” in I Love Lucy.

1:29:25.333 --> 1:29:27.291
(chuckles):
Yeah.

1:29:27.375 --> 1:29:28.875
I never thought of it that way.

1:29:28.958 --> 1:29:30.916
-Yeah, you like that?
-I like that.

1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:32.000
Yeah.

1:29:32.083 --> 1:29:33.875
(chuckles):
Jess…

1:29:33.958 --> 1:29:37.333
patronize me again,
and I'll stick my hand down your throat

1:29:37.416 --> 1:29:39.958
and pull your fucking lungs out.
(pops lips)

1:29:40.041 --> 1:29:41.791
-Look… (stammers)
-Excuse me.

1:29:41.875 --> 1:29:42.875
What is it?

1:29:42.958 --> 1:29:44.666
It-It's a telegram for Mr. Arnaz.

1:29:44.750 --> 1:29:47.416
-It's from Mr. Lyons and Philip Morris.
-Mm.

1:29:48.833 --> 1:29:50.833
-Vamos a ver.
-Yeah.

1:29:54.875 --> 1:29:56.041
Let's go, please.

1:29:56.125 --> 1:29:58.166
-We are an hour behind.
-Yeah.

1:30:03.833 --> 1:30:05.666
What does it say?

1:30:06.750 --> 1:30:09.791
“To all Philip Morris and CBS employees:

1:30:11.041 --> 1:30:13.166
Don't fuck with the Cuban.”

1:30:14.375 --> 1:30:16.958
(thunder rumbling)

1:30:19.916 --> 1:30:22.625
“He didn't come home
and he hasn't called.

1:30:22.708 --> 1:30:25.916
Not that it makes any difference to me.”

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.708
“Oh, I can see that it doesn't make
any difference to you.

1:30:28.791 --> 1:30:31.750
Why don't you call Ricky
and tell him you're sorry?”

1:30:31.833 --> 1:30:35.125
“What? You think I'd allow my pride…”
Hmm.

1:30:35.208 --> 1:30:38.416
“Do you think
I'd swallow my pride like that?”

1:30:38.500 --> 1:30:39.500
(whispers):
Never.

1:30:41.125 --> 1:30:42.333
(whispers):
What are you doing up?

1:30:42.416 --> 1:30:45.208
(hushed):
I woke up and you weren't there.

1:30:45.291 --> 1:30:49.291
So I went to the nursery
to see if everything was okay, and…

1:30:49.375 --> 1:30:51.416
she kicked her blanket off, so I fixed it.

1:30:51.500 --> 1:30:53.416
That woke her up.

1:30:53.500 --> 1:30:56.125
But as you can see,
I got her back to sleep.

1:30:56.208 --> 1:30:57.833
(thunder rumbling softly)

1:30:57.916 --> 1:31:00.791
You know we pay a housekeeper
to do the laundry, right?

1:31:01.875 --> 1:31:04.375
I like doing laundry.
I never get the chance.

1:31:05.458 --> 1:31:08.166
Okay, I'm going to put her back
in her little apartment now.

1:31:09.250 --> 1:31:10.416
You should come back to bed.

1:31:10.500 --> 1:31:11.708
I will.

1:31:13.500 --> 1:31:15.041
(exhales heavily)

1:31:17.791 --> 1:31:20.416
“Do you think I'd call him
and go crawling back?”

1:31:20.500 --> 1:31:23.083
“What? Do you think I'd swallow my pride?”

1:31:23.166 --> 1:31:26.791
“Do you think I'd call and go crawling…”

1:31:26.875 --> 1:31:29.041
-(thunder rumbling softly)
-(sighs heavily)

1:31:29.125 --> 1:31:30.500
(inhales sharply)

1:31:35.625 --> 1:31:39.666
(whispers): “What? Do you think
I'd swallow my pride like that?”

1:33:05.333 --> 1:33:07.208
-- Lucy?
-- Over here.

1:33:07.291 --> 1:33:08.750
Thanks, Bobby.

1:33:08.833 --> 1:33:10.500
You got it, Bill.

1:33:10.583 --> 1:33:12.125
(sighs) What the hell?

1:33:12.208 --> 1:33:14.125
Thanks for coming down.

1:33:15.208 --> 1:33:18.083
-It's00 in the morning.
-Sorry about that.

1:33:20.541 --> 1:33:21.541
Kid, what's going on?

1:33:21.625 --> 1:33:23.875
I'm gonna restage the dinner scene.

1:33:23.958 --> 1:33:26.291
Let's go to my dressing room
and call Desi.

1:33:26.375 --> 1:33:29.166
No, Desi's at home with the baby.
We can do this.

1:33:29.250 --> 1:33:31.250
-Does he know you're here?
-He's sleeping.

1:33:31.333 --> 1:33:33.125
Let me take you home.

1:33:34.125 --> 1:33:36.416
-Is that him?
-That's Viv.

1:33:36.500 --> 1:33:38.583
You called her, too?

1:33:38.666 --> 1:33:41.750
-I'm restaging the dinner scene.
-(car door opens, closes)

1:33:41.833 --> 1:33:43.750
This isn't for beginners, you know.
This isn't school.

1:33:43.833 --> 1:33:45.541
I don't hire the directors.

1:33:45.625 --> 1:33:47.958
I know. I'm just saying.

1:33:48.041 --> 1:33:50.875
-What's happening here?
-Thanks for coming, Viv.

1:33:50.958 --> 1:33:53.083
-Is everything all right?
-The three of us

1:33:53.166 --> 1:33:55.208
are on an empty soundstage
at00 in the morning,

1:33:55.291 --> 1:33:57.541
she's drunk, I'm not.

1:33:57.625 --> 1:33:59.458
So, yeah, everything's great.
Why do you ask?

1:33:59.541 --> 1:34:01.458
Your call just said to come to the stage,
that it was an emergency.

1:34:01.541 --> 1:34:03.333
-So I…
-We need to re-block the dinner scene.

1:34:03.416 --> 1:34:05.333
It's not gonna take long.

1:34:05.416 --> 1:34:06.833
-What?
-You heard her right.

1:34:06.916 --> 1:34:10.291
It won't take long.
We just need to make an adjustment.

1:34:11.625 --> 1:34:15.333
Two people who are fighting
have to share a seat at a dinner table.

1:34:15.416 --> 1:34:21.166
First thing, we take this, move it upstage
so the camera can see you.

1:34:21.250 --> 1:34:24.875
Now, this can't just be
a mishmash of pushing.

1:34:24.958 --> 1:34:27.166
Can't just be a scrum.

1:34:27.250 --> 1:34:29.000
Each move has to be articulate.

1:34:29.083 --> 1:34:31.416
So Ethel elbows Fred.

1:34:31.500 --> 1:34:32.500
Elbow him.

1:34:32.583 --> 1:34:33.916
(audience laughter)

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.166
Fred elbows Ethel a little harder.

1:34:36.250 --> 1:34:37.250
-Ow!
-(audience laughter)

1:34:37.333 --> 1:34:39.708
Ethel elbows Fred harder.

1:34:39.791 --> 1:34:41.208
-Hey!
-Then Fred.

1:34:42.375 --> 1:34:44.583
Now hit each other at the same time
and fall off the chair.

1:34:45.666 --> 1:34:47.833
(audience laughter, clapping)

1:34:47.916 --> 1:34:48.875
That's that.

1:34:48.958 --> 1:34:52.583
Let's run it a couple of times at speed.
Hmm?

1:34:53.583 --> 1:34:54.750
Did something happen?

1:34:54.833 --> 1:34:56.916
-I'm sorry?
-At home.

1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.250
-Did something just happen?
-Uh… (exhales)

1:34:59.333 --> 1:35:01.708
No. I was, um…

1:35:03.708 --> 1:35:05.500
No.

1:35:05.583 --> 1:35:07.583
I was doing some laundry and…

1:35:07.666 --> 1:35:09.166
No.

1:35:11.916 --> 1:35:13.916
Yeah. (sniffs) Yeah.

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:15.333
I wanted to fix this beat.

1:35:15.416 --> 1:35:18.000
I… (exhales heavily) I couldn't sleep.

1:35:23.291 --> 1:35:26.791
It's like when you're not sure
if you've left the oven unlocked.

1:35:26.875 --> 1:35:28.375
-Door unlocked. Nothing.
-(fingers snap)

1:35:28.458 --> 1:35:29.458
I wanted to fix this beat.

1:35:29.541 --> 1:35:31.375
Let's do it again.

1:35:37.083 --> 1:35:40.208
You know I did this show
so Desi and I could be together?

1:35:42.125 --> 1:35:44.500
I had no idea it was gonna be a hit.

1:35:47.208 --> 1:35:49.166
I just thought,
“Well, the construction department's gonna

1:35:49.250 --> 1:35:52.208
build us a little apartment, and
that's where we'll live most of the time.”

1:35:52.291 --> 1:35:53.958
You know?

1:35:57.541 --> 1:35:59.416
And it worked out.

1:35:59.500 --> 1:36:01.250
This is where…

1:36:08.250 --> 1:36:10.791
It's like a story
you'd read a little girl.

1:36:11.875 --> 1:36:13.875
A witch puts a curse on a woman.

1:36:13.958 --> 1:36:17.125
She'll be adored by the man she loves,

1:36:17.208 --> 1:36:20.541
but only as long as she stays on this…

1:36:20.625 --> 1:36:22.250
(whispers):
patch of ground.

1:36:23.583 --> 1:36:24.791
(chuckles softly)

1:36:26.041 --> 1:36:29.166
It's still a lot more
than most people get.

1:36:34.500 --> 1:36:35.708
Let's run it at speed.

1:36:38.208 --> 1:36:39.666
I'm gonna drive you home.

1:36:39.750 --> 1:36:42.250
-Let me take…
-I am the biggest asset

1:36:42.333 --> 1:36:45.375
in the portfolio of
the Columbia Broadcasting System,

1:36:45.458 --> 1:36:51.083
the biggest asset in the portfolio
of Philip Morris tobacco, Westinghouse.

1:36:51.166 --> 1:36:54.833
I get paid a fortune
to do exactly what I love doing.

1:36:54.916 --> 1:36:59.958
I work side by side with my husband,
who is genuinely impressed by me.

1:37:00.041 --> 1:37:04.041
And all I have to do to keep it is kill
every week for 36 weeks in a row,

1:37:04.125 --> 1:37:07.291
and then do it again the next year.

1:37:07.375 --> 1:37:09.833
Kill.

1:37:09.916 --> 1:37:12.625
So let's do it again.

1:37:23.083 --> 1:37:25.333
After RKO dropped Lucy's contract,

1:37:25.416 --> 1:37:28.250
MGM had her in for a Technicolor test,

1:37:28.333 --> 1:37:33.958
which she didn't know yet would be one of
the most important moments in her life.

1:37:34.041 --> 1:37:38.833
A man named Sydney Guilaroff
was Metro's chief hair stylist.

1:37:38.916 --> 1:37:43.833
Looked at Lucy and said, “The hair
is brown but the soul is on fire.”

1:37:45.333 --> 1:37:47.000
He dyed her hair a new color.

1:37:47.083 --> 1:37:48.375
-(indistinct chatter)
-Quiet, please.

1:37:48.458 --> 1:37:50.416
(band playing lively theme music)

1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:53.708
It's time for My Favorite Husband,
starring Lucille Ball.

1:37:53.791 --> 1:37:54.833
(applause)

1:37:54.916 --> 1:37:56.916
Jell-O, everybody!

1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:02.500
Yes, it's the gay family series,

1:38:02.583 --> 1:38:04.666
starring Lucille Ball
with Richard Denning,

1:38:04.750 --> 1:38:07.708
transcribed and brought to you
by the Jell-O family of desserts.

1:38:07.791 --> 1:38:10.291
-(band playing jingle)

1:38:21.833 --> 1:38:23.125
(jingle ends)

1:38:23.208 --> 1:38:25.333
And now, Lucille Ball with Richard Denning

1:38:25.416 --> 1:38:29.291
as Liz and George Cooper,
two people who live together and like it.

1:38:29.375 --> 1:38:30.958
-(light music playing)
-As we look in on the Coopers,

1:38:31.041 --> 1:38:33.500
it's a beautiful spring day
and Liz is just going to the kitchen

1:38:33.583 --> 1:38:35.208
-to talk to Katy, the maid.
-(birds chirping)

1:38:35.291 --> 1:38:38.125
-Oh, Katy?
-Yes, Mrs. Cooper?

1:38:38.208 --> 1:38:40.458
Katy, I've got some good news for you.

1:38:40.541 --> 1:38:42.125
-Uh-oh.
-“Uh-oh”?

1:38:42.208 --> 1:38:43.458
What do you mean, “Uh-oh”?

1:38:43.541 --> 1:38:46.625
I say I've got some good news
and you say, “Uh-oh”?

1:38:46.708 --> 1:38:48.500
(audience laughter)

1:38:48.583 --> 1:38:54.000
Every time you say you've got good news,
it's usually good for you and bad for me.

1:38:54.083 --> 1:38:56.916
Oh, well…

1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.125
that's a little true.

1:38:59.208 --> 1:39:00.500
(audience laughter)

1:39:04.541 --> 1:39:05.958
-(knocking)
-Lucy?

1:39:06.041 --> 1:39:07.708
Come on in.

1:39:09.958 --> 1:39:11.625
That was a good show.

1:39:11.708 --> 1:39:12.958
Yeah, I thought so, too.

1:39:13.041 --> 1:39:15.000
Pass it on to Maddie and Bob, would you?

1:39:15.083 --> 1:39:18.000
Mm-hmm. I've, uh, I got two gentlemen
out here who'd like to meet you,

1:39:18.083 --> 1:39:20.416
and you're gonna want to hear
what they have to say.

1:39:20.500 --> 1:39:22.541
Does it need to sound ominous?
Can't they just come in?

1:39:22.625 --> 1:39:24.083
(chuckles softly)

1:39:24.166 --> 1:39:25.625
Yeah. Please, come in.

1:39:28.583 --> 1:39:30.708
-Lucille Ball.
-Yes, sir.

1:39:30.791 --> 1:39:33.500
David Levy,
head of comedy development, CBS.

1:39:33.583 --> 1:39:35.083
David Hart,
head of current programming, CBS.

1:39:35.166 --> 1:39:38.125
Well, David and David,

1:39:38.208 --> 1:39:41.250
I've been in a current comedy at CBS
and I've never heard of either of you.

1:39:41.333 --> 1:39:43.166
CBS Television.

1:39:43.250 --> 1:39:45.291
CBS does television?

1:39:45.375 --> 1:39:48.333
-Yeah. Edward R. Murrow is one of our t…
-I was kidding.

1:39:48.416 --> 1:39:49.458
-Understood.
-That was funny.

1:39:49.541 --> 1:39:50.791
Thank you.

1:39:50.875 --> 1:39:53.291
These, uh, these men
have an interesting idea.

1:39:53.375 --> 1:39:55.750
Lucy, we've been here
to the show a few times now.

1:39:55.833 --> 1:39:58.875
We noticed that when you do the show,
you use gestures and expressions.

1:39:58.958 --> 1:40:00.125
You mean the acting?

1:40:00.208 --> 1:40:01.208
Yeah.

1:40:01.291 --> 1:40:04.583
My face, my body, my voice,
that's all I get to work with.

1:40:04.666 --> 1:40:06.750
It's just unusual because it's radio.

1:40:06.833 --> 1:40:07.833
I watched Jack Benny.

1:40:07.916 --> 1:40:10.541
He plays it for the studio audience.

1:40:10.625 --> 1:40:12.208
It works pretty well for him.

1:40:12.291 --> 1:40:13.375
It does.

1:40:13.458 --> 1:40:15.708
And it works pretty well for you, too.
Very well.

1:40:15.791 --> 1:40:18.750
And we think it's a shame
that no one gets to see it.

1:40:18.833 --> 1:40:20.833
Invent a way to see what's on the radio.

1:40:20.916 --> 1:40:23.083
We did. It's television.

1:40:23.166 --> 1:40:25.833
-Are you here to sell me one?
-Lucy.

1:40:25.916 --> 1:40:29.583
They want to put
My Favorite Husband on TV.

1:40:36.708 --> 1:40:38.333
-I'm very interested.
-(lively chatter)

1:40:38.416 --> 1:40:39.875
That's great.

1:40:39.958 --> 1:40:42.583
Is it too early to raise a glass?

1:40:42.666 --> 1:40:44.208
To My Favorite Husband.

1:40:44.291 --> 1:40:45.541
-Yes.
-(chuckles)

1:40:45.625 --> 1:40:47.875
Except I don't want to do
My Favorite Husband.

1:40:49.916 --> 1:40:52.958
-I'm confused.
-Yeah, me, too.

1:40:53.041 --> 1:40:54.708
Don't panic. It's simple.

1:40:54.791 --> 1:40:57.708
I'm interested in the idea of doing
My Favorite Husband on television.

1:40:57.791 --> 1:40:59.375
I just want it to be a different show.

1:41:00.750 --> 1:41:03.250
(chuckles):
What kind of show do you want it to be?

1:41:03.333 --> 1:41:05.833
One where Desi plays my husband.

1:41:08.416 --> 1:41:11.291
I understand there's a casting issue.

1:41:11.375 --> 1:41:13.875
-Was that to me?
-Yes.

1:41:13.958 --> 1:41:16.041
I wasn't sure. You're quite a ways away.

1:41:16.125 --> 1:41:18.583
Our casting department
has come up with a list

1:41:18.666 --> 1:41:21.333
of very exciting names
that we think you'll like.

1:41:21.416 --> 1:41:23.833
-Pass this down to Lucy.
-These are all very funny men.

1:41:23.916 --> 1:41:25.291
I think we have mimeos for everyone.

1:41:25.375 --> 1:41:27.666
One of the best lists
I've seen in a while.

1:41:27.750 --> 1:41:28.708
Number 12 died last week.

1:41:28.791 --> 1:41:30.416
-That's my fault.
-There's no issue.

1:41:30.500 --> 1:41:32.458
What was that?

1:41:32.541 --> 1:41:34.458
I was answering Mr. Macy.

1:41:34.541 --> 1:41:35.750
There's no casting issue.

1:41:35.833 --> 1:41:39.875
I'm ready and eager to do
a half-hour domestic comedy for CBS,

1:41:39.958 --> 1:41:44.416
if the role of my husband–
let's call him Shmezy– is played by Desi.

1:41:44.500 --> 1:41:46.541
-Can I remark on this?
-Please.

1:41:46.625 --> 1:41:50.541
On My Favorite Husband, your husband
is the fifth vice president of a bank.

1:41:50.625 --> 1:41:52.708
-Yes.
-Can I ask you, in all candor,

1:41:52.791 --> 1:41:56.125
do you see Desi
as the fifth vice president of a bank?

1:41:56.208 --> 1:41:59.000
I can't see him being
the fifth vice president of anything.

1:41:59.083 --> 1:42:00.666
I can see him owning the bank.

1:42:01.625 --> 1:42:02.833
You see the problem?

1:42:02.916 --> 1:42:04.958
I see what you think is the problem.

1:42:05.041 --> 1:42:06.333
-Lucy.
-Yes.

1:42:06.416 --> 1:42:08.875
I don't ordinarily come
to meetings like this.

1:42:08.958 --> 1:42:13.166
This meeting is several floors below
my general interest.

1:42:13.250 --> 1:42:16.958
I'm here to deliver a hard truth.

1:42:17.041 --> 1:42:23.416
We cannot have an all-American girl
married to a man who isn't American.

1:42:23.500 --> 1:42:25.083
He is American.

1:42:25.166 --> 1:42:29.083
He was a sergeant in the U.S. Army
and he served in the war.

1:42:29.166 --> 1:42:31.916
You know exactly what I mean, Lucy.

1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.125
-He's Spanish.
-Still no.

1:42:34.208 --> 1:42:35.625
He's never been to Spain in his life.

1:42:35.708 --> 1:42:37.250
He speaks Spanish. He was born in Cuba.

1:42:37.333 --> 1:42:41.500
His father was the mayor of Santiago,
Cuba's second largest city.

1:42:41.583 --> 1:42:43.583
-You know exactly what…
-What you mean? Yes.

1:42:43.666 --> 1:42:44.708
I do.

1:42:44.791 --> 1:42:47.250
Look, I'm not here
to get a job for my nephew.

1:42:47.333 --> 1:42:49.958
Desi Arnaz is a phenomenally talented man.

1:42:50.041 --> 1:42:52.833
Not just a world-class musician,
but a very good actor

1:42:52.916 --> 1:42:56.416
who would be a movie star if there was
such a thing as a Cuban movie star.

1:42:56.500 --> 1:42:59.041
Moreover, we work very well together.

1:42:59.125 --> 1:43:02.500
I go out and meet him when he's touring,
he brings me up for some sketches,

1:43:02.583 --> 1:43:03.833
and it works.

1:43:03.916 --> 1:43:05.166
-Jess?
-Yeah, it works.

1:43:05.250 --> 1:43:08.000
Any cultural differences
will make for good comedy.

1:43:08.083 --> 1:43:09.208
Am I right, Jess?

1:43:09.291 --> 1:43:10.875
You're not wrong.

1:43:10.958 --> 1:43:12.583
Now, I don't want to take
another meeting like this

1:43:12.666 --> 1:43:14.666
'cause I don't know how many more people
will fit around the table.

1:43:14.750 --> 1:43:16.916
My position is not gonna change.

1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:18.416
You want me on television?

1:43:18.500 --> 1:43:21.000
There is only one television show
that I'm willing to do.

1:43:21.083 --> 1:43:23.791
So, what's it gonna be?

1:43:24.875 --> 1:43:26.458
(sighs softly)

1:43:27.541 --> 1:43:30.708
(band playing I Love Lucy theme)

1:43:37.250 --> 1:43:38.666
(lively chatter)

1:43:50.541 --> 1:43:51.916
All right, holding. Get Des.

1:43:57.500 --> 1:44:00.375
-(music ends)
-(applause)

1:44:00.458 --> 1:44:02.416
(applause continues in distance)

1:44:03.500 --> 1:44:04.958
We think it's about 15 minutes.

1:44:06.041 --> 1:44:07.541
-You think?
-We're holding for something.

1:44:07.625 --> 1:44:10.375
-I'm not sure what.
-Okay, thanks.

1:44:10.458 --> 1:44:11.875
Holding?

1:44:13.083 --> 1:44:14.250
(knocking)

1:44:14.333 --> 1:44:16.333
Yeah, come in.

1:44:17.375 --> 1:44:19.000
(sighs)

1:44:20.541 --> 1:44:22.875
-Can I have a second?
-Sure.

1:44:23.833 --> 1:44:25.833
-(footsteps receding)
-(band playing in distance)

1:44:27.333 --> 1:44:29.041
I think I know why you want to see me.

1:44:29.125 --> 1:44:31.208
-Do you?
-Hear me out.

1:44:31.291 --> 1:44:32.416
I asked you to do me a favor, Jess.

1:44:32.500 --> 1:44:34.416
-I asked you to give him an E.P. credit.
-Mm-hmm.

1:44:34.500 --> 1:44:38.250
Instead, you tried to convince him he was
the title character or some bullshit.

1:44:38.333 --> 1:44:39.375
What the hell was that?!

1:44:39.458 --> 1:44:40.791
-I'm sorry if he was insulted.
-(sighs)

1:44:40.875 --> 1:44:42.416
I mean, I know he's insulted,
so I'm sorry.

1:44:42.500 --> 1:44:44.916
He wasn't insulted.
He was laughing about it.

1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:46.541
But, yeah, he's insulted.

1:44:46.625 --> 1:44:48.208
No, he's offended. I'm insulted.

1:44:48.291 --> 1:44:51.458
-I asked you to do me a small favor.
-Yeah.

1:44:51.541 --> 1:44:53.416
And it's not like
you don't owe me a couple.

1:44:53.500 --> 1:44:55.583
(sighs)

1:44:55.666 --> 1:44:57.666
It wasn't a small favor.

1:44:57.750 --> 1:44:59.541
And I don't know what you think I owe you.

1:44:59.625 --> 1:45:01.375
-Really?
-It wasn't a small favor.

1:45:01.458 --> 1:45:04.250
-You asked me to save your marriage.
-No, I…

1:45:04.333 --> 1:45:06.333
And-and it's not the first time
you've asked me to do that, is it?

1:45:06.416 --> 1:45:09.208
I asked you to give him
an E.P. credit, that's all.

1:45:09.291 --> 1:45:11.416
Oh, no problem.
Can my wife play Lucy once in a while?

1:45:11.500 --> 1:45:13.250
If your wife played Lucy once in a while,

1:45:13.333 --> 1:45:15.958
I would think it appropriate
she be so credited.

1:45:16.041 --> 1:45:17.583
And what do you mean
it's not the first time

1:45:17.666 --> 1:45:19.625
-I asked you to save my marriage?
-(scoffs)

1:45:19.708 --> 1:45:21.375
(imitating Lucille): “Jess, Jess,
we'll have Desi play my husband.

1:45:21.458 --> 1:45:23.583
-It'll save my marriage.”
-Was that supposed to be me?

1:45:23.666 --> 1:45:25.083
-Yeah, yeah.
-Don't do voices.

1:45:25.166 --> 1:45:27.083
Oh, are you insulted? Desi's offended?

1:45:27.166 --> 1:45:29.875
You asked me to give away my job title
like it was a parking spot!

1:45:29.958 --> 1:45:31.208
You're right.

1:45:31.291 --> 1:45:32.708
-I'm sorry!
-Jesus Christ, Lucy!

1:45:32.791 --> 1:45:34.625
Sometimes I think that you…

1:45:37.625 --> 1:45:38.833
Wait, what?

1:45:40.416 --> 1:45:42.125
You're right. I'm sorry.

1:45:42.208 --> 1:45:43.375
I was dead wrong.

1:45:43.458 --> 1:45:45.666
I wasn't expecting that.

1:45:45.750 --> 1:45:47.250
-I know.
-Have you ever said that to me before?

1:45:47.333 --> 1:45:49.250
I doubt it, but…

1:45:49.333 --> 1:45:51.791
I've thought it, if that means anything.

1:45:51.875 --> 1:45:53.708
It does.

1:45:54.708 --> 1:45:57.875
It's just been
a compound fracture of a week.

1:45:59.875 --> 1:46:01.500
Hey.

1:46:01.583 --> 1:46:03.625
-Why are we holding?
-I'm not sure.

1:46:03.708 --> 1:46:05.208
We're holding. Someone has to know why.

1:46:05.291 --> 1:46:07.250
-He's-he's coming.
-(knocking)

1:46:07.333 --> 1:46:09.625
-(sighs)
-Come in.

1:46:09.708 --> 1:46:11.458
Desi's asking to see you in his office.

1:46:12.541 --> 1:46:14.583
-You mean in his dressing room?
-No, he's in his office

1:46:14.666 --> 1:46:17.083
with some CBS executives
and some men from Philip Morris.

1:46:19.875 --> 1:46:21.583
Why is he in his office at showtime?

1:46:28.125 --> 1:46:30.875
The evening editions just came out.

1:46:34.833 --> 1:46:36.250
Listen to me.

1:46:36.333 --> 1:46:38.000
Memorize this.

1:46:38.083 --> 1:46:40.041
“It's none of your fucking business.”

1:46:44.208 --> 1:46:45.291
There.

1:46:45.375 --> 1:46:47.791
Let that be the best thing I ever wrote.

1:46:54.416 --> 1:46:55.625
Nah.

1:46:55.708 --> 1:46:57.416
It's still “Vitameatavegamin.”

1:47:00.500 --> 1:47:01.958
(sighs)

1:47:05.208 --> 1:47:07.208
(hushed chatter)

1:47:10.791 --> 1:47:12.208
(chatter quiets)

1:47:15.875 --> 1:47:17.041
(clears throat)

1:47:19.125 --> 1:47:20.541
The evening edition.

1:47:25.375 --> 1:47:26.791
-It's all right.
-(sighs)

1:47:26.875 --> 1:47:28.291
It's all right.

1:47:29.583 --> 1:47:30.583
(exhales sharply)

1:47:30.666 --> 1:47:32.500
It's in four-inch type.

1:47:32.583 --> 1:47:34.583
I'm gonna fix this.

1:47:34.666 --> 1:47:36.000
That's Hindenburg type.

1:47:36.083 --> 1:47:38.041
I've already made the calls.

1:47:38.125 --> 1:47:39.916
-And they used red ink.
-Yeah.

1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:42.416
I didn't even know newspapers had red ink.

1:47:42.500 --> 1:47:43.833
I guess they do.

1:47:43.916 --> 1:47:46.208
I was cleared.

1:47:46.291 --> 1:47:49.541
Somehow, the city editor,
a woman named Agness Underwood,

1:47:49.625 --> 1:47:54.375
has a photostatic copy of the affidavit
showing you registered in 1936

1:47:54.458 --> 1:47:56.750
as a voter intending to affiliate
with the Communist Party.

1:47:56.833 --> 1:47:58.000
But I was cleared.

1:47:58.083 --> 1:48:00.041
After the testimony,
they stamped “canceled” on the card,

1:48:00.125 --> 1:48:01.166
and I saw the card.

1:48:01.250 --> 1:48:02.791
Other papers are
showing the canceled card.

1:48:02.875 --> 1:48:05.750
They're running a caption that says,
“Note the cancellation at left.”

1:48:05.833 --> 1:48:10.125
But the Herald-Express took the word
“canceled” out of the document altogether.

1:48:10.208 --> 1:48:11.583
Other papers?

1:48:11.666 --> 1:48:14.666
Yes, yes, but I've-I've made calls
and we are taking care of this.

1:48:14.750 --> 1:48:16.791
-We– Eh?
-Calls to who?

1:48:16.875 --> 1:48:18.833
Every reporter within 20 minutes
of this soundstage.

1:48:18.916 --> 1:48:20.000
That's why we're holding.

1:48:20.083 --> 1:48:22.250
-You're saying reporters are coming here?
-Yeah.

1:48:22.333 --> 1:48:24.416
We'll seat them in the back
of the bleachers.

1:48:24.500 --> 1:48:26.541
You think we're still filming a show?

1:48:26.625 --> 1:48:29.000
Why are none of you talking?

1:48:29.083 --> 1:48:30.500
Desi has an idea.

1:48:30.583 --> 1:48:34.833
I'm going to warm up the audience
the way I always do,

1:48:34.916 --> 1:48:38.666
except instead of “Cuban Pete”
and the joke about the turtle,

1:48:38.750 --> 1:48:40.875
I'm going to tell them what happened.

1:48:40.958 --> 1:48:44.291
I'm going to explain
that you checked the wrong box,

1:48:44.375 --> 1:48:47.291
I'm going to show them
the canceled document,

1:48:47.375 --> 1:48:49.750
and then I'm going to bring you out

1:48:49.833 --> 1:48:52.500
so the press sees them
give you a round of applause.

1:48:52.583 --> 1:48:53.666
Yes.

1:48:54.666 --> 1:48:55.875
Hmm?

1:48:57.250 --> 1:48:59.208
Fellas, can we, um…

1:48:59.291 --> 1:49:01.375
have the room for just a moment?

1:49:14.625 --> 1:49:18.541
You're not telling these people
that I checked the wrong box.

1:49:18.625 --> 1:49:20.625
This is a critical moment, Lucy.

1:49:20.708 --> 1:49:22.625
-If I'm gonna die…
-You're not.

1:49:22.708 --> 1:49:24.541
…I would rather die standing up.

1:49:24.625 --> 1:49:25.916
(scoffs) I don't have any idea
what that is suppo…

1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:27.791
I'm not an idiot.
I didn't check the wrong box.

1:49:27.875 --> 1:49:28.875
You saw the headline.

1:49:28.958 --> 1:49:31.833
-You can see the headline
from outer space. -Then please…

1:49:31.916 --> 1:49:34.958
Grandpa Fred raised me
from when I was age four.

1:49:35.041 --> 1:49:38.125
He cared about the little guy.
He cared about workers' rights.

1:49:38.208 --> 1:49:41.000
It was a tribute to him,
and to say that I checked the wrong…

1:49:41.083 --> 1:49:42.458
Grandpa Fred, Grandpa Fred.

1:49:42.541 --> 1:49:45.458
Grandpa Fred was wrong, Lucy!

1:49:45.541 --> 1:49:49.083
Yes, he didn't tell you the part
where they throw your father in prison

1:49:49.166 --> 1:49:51.291
for the crime
of being the mayor of a city.

1:49:51.375 --> 1:49:55.666
I was chased to this country, Lucy!

1:49:55.750 --> 1:49:57.833
Believe me, you checked the wrong box!

1:50:00.791 --> 1:50:02.333
And if they don't applaud?

1:50:03.958 --> 1:50:06.666
They will.
And the press will write that they did.

1:50:09.208 --> 1:50:11.541
You're gonna tell them I was accused of…

1:50:11.625 --> 1:50:14.083
They're going to read it
in the morning anyway.

1:50:14.166 --> 1:50:17.875
We have a sample population
of 200 people on our stage, so…

1:50:17.958 --> 1:50:19.541
Miss Rosen!

1:50:19.625 --> 1:50:21.625
If they boo me?

1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:24.666
If they boo you…

1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:28.958
…then we're done.

1:50:29.041 --> 1:50:31.250
-Here, tonight.
-(door opens)

1:50:38.750 --> 1:50:40.375
Call this man.

1:50:41.833 --> 1:50:44.583
Tell them it's for me.

1:50:44.666 --> 1:50:46.000
They'll find him.

1:50:46.083 --> 1:50:48.250
He's expecting my call.

1:50:48.333 --> 1:50:49.833
Tell me when you have him.

1:50:49.916 --> 1:50:51.333
Yes, sir.

1:50:52.666 --> 1:50:54.041
(door closes)

1:50:58.916 --> 1:51:00.916
(rumba music playing faintly)

1:51:02.875 --> 1:51:04.875
(music continues inside)

1:51:09.500 --> 1:51:11.916
Someone said they spotted you
going out here.

1:51:13.083 --> 1:51:14.750
(sighs)

1:51:17.666 --> 1:51:18.875
I was just told.

1:51:18.958 --> 1:51:20.250
(sighs)

1:51:20.333 --> 1:51:23.333
Jesus, Lulu. Four-inch type?

1:51:23.416 --> 1:51:25.041
Red ink.

1:51:27.916 --> 1:51:29.625
I shouldn't have piled on this week.

1:51:29.708 --> 1:51:31.125
It just…

1:51:32.250 --> 1:51:33.583
What?

1:51:34.583 --> 1:51:36.791
None of that matters right now.

1:51:39.416 --> 1:51:41.166
May be the last time we're out here.

1:51:41.250 --> 1:51:43.041
Say it.

1:51:43.125 --> 1:51:44.750
(sighs)

1:51:47.291 --> 1:51:50.666
Lucy Ricardo is married to a man
six years younger than she is,

1:51:50.750 --> 1:51:54.041
and Ethel is married to her grandfather,
and it's understood,

1:51:54.125 --> 1:51:56.958
as the underlying premise
for a running joke,

1:51:57.041 --> 1:51:59.333
that I'm not pretty enough for him.

1:51:59.416 --> 1:52:00.625
(clicks tongue)

1:52:02.166 --> 1:52:04.333
It got to me.

1:52:04.416 --> 1:52:06.166
And at the world's worst time.

1:52:13.583 --> 1:52:15.666
That was a knockout dress.

1:52:16.750 --> 1:52:18.958
(chuckles)

1:52:19.041 --> 1:52:21.416
Oh. You two want to be alone out here?

1:52:21.500 --> 1:52:22.666
-No.
-Yes.

1:52:22.750 --> 1:52:24.583
(Madelyn chuckles)

1:52:28.208 --> 1:52:29.791
(Madelyn sighs)

1:52:32.083 --> 1:52:33.708
You're my hero.

1:52:35.666 --> 1:52:37.583
I care about what works, Maddie.

1:52:39.500 --> 1:52:42.125
I care about what's funny.

1:52:42.208 --> 1:52:47.500
I don't see myself caring about a
woman's perspective from a new generation.

1:52:47.583 --> 1:52:49.583
I care about you.

1:52:52.875 --> 1:52:54.666
I'd love for someone
to bring me breakfast.

1:52:54.750 --> 1:52:58.333
-That's not what we were talking about.
-(chuckles)

1:52:58.416 --> 1:53:01.166
Doesn't a P.A.
bring you breakfast every day?

1:53:01.250 --> 1:53:02.916
-Yes.
-Okay.

1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:04.583
Never French toast.

1:53:04.666 --> 1:53:06.958
-We'll look into that.
-I came out here

1:53:07.041 --> 1:53:11.791
to try to distract you with nonsense,
but I assume these two beat me to it.

1:53:11.875 --> 1:53:15.458
Viv doesn't like the jokes
about Ethel being unappealing.

1:53:15.541 --> 1:53:18.625
Yeah, there's no one within the sound
of her voice who doesn't know that.

1:53:18.708 --> 1:53:21.166
I said what I felt.

1:53:21.250 --> 1:53:24.541
You've been saying what you felt
since the first day of work.

1:53:24.625 --> 1:53:27.500
It's not like you've suddenly
given voice to your feelings.

1:53:29.958 --> 1:53:31.166
You know what?

1:53:33.500 --> 1:53:35.208
Sweet ladies?

1:53:38.250 --> 1:53:40.583
Something dies inside a man…

1:53:41.916 --> 1:53:44.958
…it just dies…

1:53:46.083 --> 1:53:49.458
…the first time
he hears a girl call him old.

1:53:53.083 --> 1:53:58.375
So on the subject of
Jess, Bob and Madelyn writing Ethel jokes,

1:53:58.458 --> 1:54:00.166
I'm indifferent.

1:54:00.250 --> 1:54:03.250
(groans) You two…

1:54:06.083 --> 1:54:08.208
…are good actors.

1:54:10.958 --> 1:54:12.958
It's a privilege doing this show with you.

1:54:13.041 --> 1:54:14.958
Now you're scaring the shit out of me.

1:54:15.041 --> 1:54:16.125
I was just gonna say.

1:54:16.208 --> 1:54:18.083
Desi's gonna tell the audience.

1:54:18.166 --> 1:54:19.375
He's invited press.

1:54:19.458 --> 1:54:21.791
He's betting that the audience
will accept the truth,

1:54:21.875 --> 1:54:24.291
give their approval,
and the press will write about it.

1:54:30.916 --> 1:54:32.541
I'd take the other side of that bet.

1:54:32.625 --> 1:54:33.625
-(door opens)
-P.A.: Excuse me.

1:54:33.708 --> 1:54:35.666
Sorry.
Mr. Arnaz is ready to do the warm-up.

1:54:35.750 --> 1:54:38.250
Uh, they told me you wanted to know.

1:54:38.333 --> 1:54:39.750
Thank you.

1:54:43.291 --> 1:54:45.166
All right. (clears throat)

1:54:47.625 --> 1:54:49.541
See you out there.

1:54:53.166 --> 1:54:55.333
-Good show.
-Good show.

1:54:55.416 --> 1:54:56.666
Good show.

1:55:00.125 --> 1:55:01.458
Luce.

1:55:03.333 --> 1:55:07.125
The dinner scene is inarguably better.

1:55:10.083 --> 1:55:12.083
(band playing lively music)

1:55:13.333 --> 1:55:15.333
(music continues)

1:55:18.541 --> 1:55:20.458
(indistinct chatter)

1:55:29.458 --> 1:55:31.083
(music ends)

1:55:31.166 --> 1:55:33.875
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
give a warm welcome

1:55:33.958 --> 1:55:36.583
to one of the stars of I Love Lucy.

1:55:36.666 --> 1:55:38.875
-You know him as Ricky Ricardo.
-(women gasping)

1:55:38.958 --> 1:55:41.083
Here's Desi Arnaz!

1:55:41.166 --> 1:55:43.083
-(applause)
-(band plays bright riff)

1:55:43.166 --> 1:55:44.500
Thank you.

1:55:44.583 --> 1:55:45.875
Oh, thank you.

1:55:45.958 --> 1:55:48.416
(people shouting “Desi!")

1:55:48.500 --> 1:55:51.416
Thank you. Thank you.

1:55:51.500 --> 1:55:54.000
Thank you very much. (sighs)

1:55:54.083 --> 1:55:56.833
Usually, right now, I'd be doing
the final audience warm-up.

1:55:56.916 --> 1:55:58.333
I'd tell you an old joke about a turtle.

1:55:58.416 --> 1:56:00.166
-(laughter)
-And I'd point out

1:56:00.250 --> 1:56:03.250
our groundbreaking camera system
that allows the studio audience

1:56:03.333 --> 1:56:08.375
to watch the show unobstructed
and introduce you to the rest of the cast.

1:56:08.458 --> 1:56:11.958
I'm not doing that tonight,
and here's why.

1:56:12.041 --> 1:56:16.416
Last week, my wife, Lucille Ball,

1:56:16.500 --> 1:56:19.541
was asked to testify
in front of a closed session

1:56:19.625 --> 1:56:23.000
of the House
Un-American Activities Committee.

1:56:23.083 --> 1:56:24.583
(audience murmuring)

1:56:24.666 --> 1:56:28.000
Yes, the congressmen
who investigate Communism.

1:56:29.083 --> 1:56:33.916
After hours of testimony,
the committee concluded unambiguously

1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:38.500
that Lucy was and is in no way
involved with the Communist Party.

1:56:38.583 --> 1:56:40.875
So everything's swell, right?

1:56:40.958 --> 1:56:42.791
No.

1:56:42.875 --> 1:56:46.958
Because this is the evening edition
headline in the Herald-Express.

1:56:48.958 --> 1:56:50.708
(audience gasping, murmuring)

1:57:02.458 --> 1:57:03.833
So… (clears throat)

1:57:03.916 --> 1:57:05.583
I made some phone calls.

1:57:05.666 --> 1:57:07.750
I called the editor of the Herald-Express.

1:57:07.833 --> 1:57:10.291
I called the chairman of the committee.

1:57:10.375 --> 1:57:13.250
I called all the members of the committee.

1:57:13.333 --> 1:57:16.500
And I made one more call to someone,
and I believe he's still on the line.

1:57:16.583 --> 1:57:17.583
Thank you.

1:57:18.958 --> 1:57:20.541
Are you still with me, sir?

1:57:20.625 --> 1:57:22.583
MAN (on phone, amplified):
Yes.

1:57:22.666 --> 1:57:26.000
I'm now standing in front of a
studio audience in Hollywood, California,

1:57:26.083 --> 1:57:28.916
and we are joined by
a number of members of the press.

1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:30.041
That's fine.

1:57:32.166 --> 1:57:36.666
We want to know, sir, does the FBI
have any case against Lucy?

1:57:36.750 --> 1:57:41.291
Does the FBI have any evidence
of wrongdoing?

1:57:41.375 --> 1:57:47.500
Does the FBI have any reason to believe
that Lucille Ball is a Communist?

1:57:47.583 --> 1:57:49.541
No. Absolutely nothing.

1:57:49.625 --> 1:57:52.458
-She's 100% clear.
-(audience murmuring)

1:57:52.541 --> 1:57:53.958
Thank you, sir. One more question.

1:57:54.041 --> 1:57:55.625
Will you tell us your name please?

1:57:55.708 --> 1:57:57.583
This is J. Edgar Hoover.

1:57:57.666 --> 1:57:59.041
-(audience gasping)
-Thank you, sir.

1:57:59.125 --> 1:58:00.458
Enjoy your evening.

1:58:00.541 --> 1:58:02.541
(applause)

1:58:07.583 --> 1:58:11.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome my wife

1:58:11.083 --> 1:58:13.583
and the star of I Love Lucy, Lucille Ball!

1:58:13.666 --> 1:58:15.666
(audience cheering)

1:58:34.541 --> 1:58:36.916
(cheering continues)

1:58:47.833 --> 1:58:49.833
So enjoy the show!

1:58:51.250 --> 1:58:53.041
-(band playing I Love Lucy theme)
-(applause)

1:59:02.541 --> 1:59:04.958
-(sighing)
-(music, applause continue in distance)

1:59:05.041 --> 1:59:06.666
(footsteps approaching)

1:59:07.875 --> 1:59:09.208
It's all over!

1:59:09.291 --> 1:59:10.333
Thank you.

1:59:10.416 --> 1:59:12.166
-It's over now.
-Thank you.

1:59:12.250 --> 1:59:13.333
They love you.

1:59:13.416 --> 1:59:15.583
I love you.

1:59:15.666 --> 1:59:18.583
No one's gonna mess with you ever, Lucy.

1:59:18.666 --> 1:59:20.583
I thought they were gonna boo.

1:59:20.666 --> 1:59:22.541
(laughs) You want to do a show?

1:59:22.625 --> 1:59:24.125
Have you been cheating on me?

1:59:25.208 --> 1:59:27.583
-What?
-Have you been cheating on me?

1:59:27.666 --> 1:59:29.500
-(laughs) Is this a bit?
-No.

1:59:30.583 --> 1:59:31.666
No, I haven't been.

1:59:31.750 --> 1:59:34.208
When you stay out all night,
you're on the boat playing cards?

1:59:34.291 --> 1:59:36.083
-Yes.
-You haven't been with anybody else?

1:59:36.166 --> 1:59:38.666
-What's going on with you, honey?
-Don't gaslight me.

1:59:38.750 --> 1:59:39.875
Where did this come from?

1:59:39.958 --> 1:59:41.958
I mean, they just cheered
for you out there.

1:59:42.041 --> 1:59:43.458
They got it right, didn't they?

1:59:43.541 --> 1:59:46.625
-Lucy…
-They only got the picture wrong.

1:59:46.708 --> 1:59:48.666
-Luc…
-Did they get it right?

1:59:48.750 --> 1:59:50.583
-Lucy…
-Did they get it exactly right?

1:59:50.666 --> 1:59:55.041
Jesus Christ, I just proved out there
that the Herald-Express got it wrong.

1:59:55.125 --> 1:59:57.541
You think Confidential magazine–

1:59:57.625 --> 1:59:59.916
Conf– We're about to do a show.

2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:01.458
-(whispers): Just tell me.
-Tell me why you think–

2:00:01.541 --> 2:00:04.541
other than that garbage–

2:00:04.625 --> 2:00:07.125
tell me why you think I've cheated on you.

2:00:10.541 --> 2:00:13.208
That is your lipstick.

2:00:13.291 --> 2:00:16.125
Remember? You kissed me
at the beginning of the week,

2:00:16.208 --> 2:00:18.458
and then took my handkerchief
and wiped the lipstick off

2:00:18.541 --> 2:00:19.833
and put it back in my pocket.

2:00:19.916 --> 2:00:21.291
And you said you'd never done that before.

2:00:21.375 --> 2:00:22.458
I hadn't.

2:00:22.541 --> 2:00:24.208
Then what the hell are we talking about?

2:00:25.875 --> 2:00:28.166
This is my lipstick.

2:00:28.250 --> 2:00:29.416
(chuckles softly)

2:00:43.166 --> 2:00:45.583
They were just call girls.

2:00:45.666 --> 2:00:47.041
Hmm.

2:00:49.583 --> 2:00:50.875
They're hookers.

2:00:50.958 --> 2:00:52.375
(exhales heavily)

2:00:57.916 --> 2:01:00.000
It doesn't mean anything, Lucy.

2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.208
-Look, Lucy, it doesn't mean…
-Mm.

2:01:03.291 --> 2:01:04.750
Let's do the show. Yeah?

2:01:04.833 --> 2:01:06.500
Let's just forget about this
for a half hour.

2:01:06.583 --> 2:01:07.875
Yeah? Let's do the show.

2:01:07.958 --> 2:01:10.500
Jim, let's go!

2:01:10.583 --> 2:01:13.166
-It's not gonna get better than this.
-Copy that.

2:01:13.250 --> 2:01:15.458
-All right, everybody!
-Let's do a show!

2:01:15.541 --> 2:01:17.416
This is places for scene “A”!

2:01:17.500 --> 2:01:19.166
-- Scene “A”!
-- Scene “A,” places!

2:01:19.250 --> 2:01:21.291
Okay, positions, everyone.

2:01:21.375 --> 2:01:22.875
-Cameras up.
-Cameras up.

2:01:22.958 --> 2:01:24.291
Quiet on set. Bell!

2:01:24.375 --> 2:01:25.375
(soundstage bell rings)

2:01:25.458 --> 2:01:26.791
-Quiet please!
-Quiet please!

2:01:26.875 --> 2:01:28.208
Picture's up!

2:01:28.291 --> 2:01:30.083
-Picture's up.
-Quiet, everyone!

2:01:30.166 --> 2:01:32.166
-Let's roll sound.
-Rolling! -Rolling!

2:01:32.250 --> 2:01:33.541
-Sound speed.
-And mark.

2:01:33.625 --> 2:01:35.541
-Speed mark.
-Dolly.

2:01:35.625 --> 2:01:37.791
Settle. And action.

2:01:38.875 --> 2:01:40.958
It ended up being a good show that night.

2:01:41.041 --> 2:01:43.958
We did both versions of the opening,

2:01:44.041 --> 2:01:46.250
but it was the original version
that made it on the air,

2:01:46.333 --> 2:01:47.541
the one with all the names.

2:01:47.625 --> 2:01:51.000
You must've gotten a copy
of the “B” negative,

2:01:51.083 --> 2:01:52.583
'cause your original question was…

2:01:52.666 --> 2:01:55.500
For the record, I won my bet with Desi.

2:01:55.583 --> 2:01:57.958
CBS wouldn't let us use
the word “pregnant.”

2:01:59.541 --> 2:02:01.375
But more people watched
the birth of Little Ricky

2:02:01.458 --> 2:02:04.666
than had ever watched
a television program before.

2:02:05.833 --> 2:02:07.083
Your original question?

2:02:07.166 --> 2:02:10.458
You asked about why Lucy stopped
when we were doing the alt.

2:02:10.541 --> 2:02:11.708
The alternate version.

2:02:11.791 --> 2:02:14.833
We were doing Lucy's version
of Ricky's entrance first.

2:02:14.916 --> 2:02:16.541
She was doing the bit with the flowers,

2:02:16.625 --> 2:02:19.208
which we couldn't use
'cause we were running long.

2:02:21.500 --> 2:02:24.250
(audience laughter)

2:02:27.791 --> 2:02:31.833
She takes a pitcher
and pours water into the vase…

2:02:31.916 --> 2:02:34.625
Which makes all the flowers
come up to the surface.

2:02:37.916 --> 2:02:40.083
(audience laughter)

2:02:44.083 --> 2:02:47.500
It seemed like she just got lost
in her own head for a second.

2:02:47.583 --> 2:02:49.333
I can't remember what her cue was.

2:02:49.416 --> 2:02:52.041
It may have been the only time
she ever went up on a line.

2:02:52.125 --> 2:02:55.083
I can't remember the first line, but we…

2:02:55.166 --> 2:02:56.583
we had to stop and go again.

2:02:56.666 --> 2:02:58.666
It was Desi's line.

2:02:58.750 --> 2:03:00.500
It was the new bit Lucy put in.

2:03:01.708 --> 2:03:03.166
(chuckles):
What was his line?

2:03:03.250 --> 2:03:06.750
Lucy, I'm home!

2:03:06.833 --> 2:03:08.833
(audience laughter)

2:03:31.458 --> 2:03:32.666
(chuckles softly)

2:03:35.458 --> 2:03:36.666
Sorry.

2:03:36.750 --> 2:03:38.416
-I got lost for a second.
-(audience chuckles)

2:03:38.500 --> 2:03:39.916
All right, let's cut and go again.

2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:44.291
We never went back to do
another take of the alternate opening.

2:03:44.375 --> 2:03:46.541
Lucy just wanted to move on.

2:03:55.583 --> 2:03:57.583
(audience laughter)

2:04:00.583 --> 2:04:02.708
-Oh!
-Guess who it is.

2:04:02.791 --> 2:04:05.500
Bill? Sam?

2:04:05.583 --> 2:04:07.416
-Pat?
-No.

2:04:07.500 --> 2:04:11.083
-(audience laughter)
-Pedro? Pablo?

2:04:11.166 --> 2:04:12.333
Jose?

2:04:12.416 --> 2:04:13.708
No, it's me.

2:04:13.791 --> 2:04:16.291
-Ah, yes, of course.
-(laughter continues)

2:04:16.375 --> 2:04:19.166
-Uh…
-Very, very funny.

2:04:19.250 --> 2:04:21.666
-Hey, company for dinner?

2:04:21.750 --> 2:04:22.750
Who is it?

2:04:22.833 --> 2:04:24.833
How do you like
the new water glasses, Ricky?

2:04:24.916 --> 2:04:26.458
Who's coming for dinner, Lucy?

2:04:26.541 --> 2:04:29.166
Doesn't the table look beautiful tonight?

2:04:29.250 --> 2:04:32.208
-Lucy, who is it?
-Some people.

2:06:53.916 --> 2:06:55.916
(music fades)

2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000
(“Cuban Pete” playing)

2:08:12.250 --> 2:08:16.500
-(song ends)

2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.000
(music fades)
