We've got a male, 30s,

00:13.132 --> 00:14.765
victim of MVC.

00:14.767 --> 00:17.218
Multiple fractures,
rigid abdomen

00:17.220 --> 00:18.585
pulmonary contusions.

00:18.587 --> 00:21.188
Got two liters of saline
running wide open

00:21.190 --> 00:22.923
for a BP of 60 over 40.

00:22.925 --> 00:25.493

00:41.910 --> 00:44.211
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

Holy crap!

01:25.120 --> 01:27.288
Whose turn is it to pick
the food truck today?

01:27.290 --> 01:28.489
Deeks.

01:28.491 --> 01:29.790
He said he found something
really different.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.325
Why doesn't he just
pick the shrimp curry?

01:31.327 --> 01:32.510
Everyone likes
the shrimp curry.

01:32.512 --> 01:34.545
I think he was going
for a culinary home run.

01:34.547 --> 01:36.347
Why do I get the feeling
he's going to have

01:36.349 --> 01:37.465
a major league strikeout?

01:37.467 --> 01:38.832
You know, you really
should think about

01:38.834 --> 01:39.850
expanding your palate, Sam.

01:39.852 --> 01:41.836
I just got a thing
for the shrimp curry.

01:41.838 --> 01:43.054
Think positive.

01:43.056 --> 01:44.722
Maybe he has something
that'll blow you away.

01:44.724 --> 01:46.807
You said Deeks was
picking, right?

01:46.809 --> 01:48.225
He back yet?

01:48.227 --> 01:49.310
Any minute now.

01:49.312 --> 01:50.644
And it should be interesting.

01:50.646 --> 01:51.812
Deeks loves food.

01:51.814 --> 01:53.481
He also love Donny and Marie.

01:55.318 --> 01:56.534
What'd you get?

01:56.536 --> 01:58.018
Comin' at ya-- hoo-ha.

01:58.020 --> 01:59.153
Little bit of that.

01:59.155 --> 02:00.454
Heads up.

02:00.456 --> 02:02.189
It'll change your
life, right here.

02:02.191 --> 02:04.075
This looks like a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

02:04.077 --> 02:05.659
That's what I'm talking about.

02:09.030 --> 02:11.082
Did you experience
a head injury, Deeks?

02:11.084 --> 02:13.551
Uh, not that I'm aware of.

02:13.553 --> 02:14.802
But I do sleepwalk.

02:14.804 --> 02:17.037
Hundreds of food trucks
in Los Angeles

02:17.039 --> 02:18.205
and the best you can do

02:18.207 --> 02:19.724
is a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich?

02:19.726 --> 02:21.425
Seriously?
Okay, hold on a second.

02:21.427 --> 02:23.394
This is not your
run-of-the mill PB&J

02:23.396 --> 02:25.229
All right, people?

02:25.231 --> 02:27.515
This, right here,

02:27.517 --> 02:29.266
is organic hazelnut butter

02:29.268 --> 02:30.884
with a mango-chutney marmalade.

02:30.886 --> 02:32.186
That's what this is.

02:32.188 --> 02:34.221
Uh-huh.

02:34.223 --> 02:36.824
What are you look...
what are you looking at?

02:36.826 --> 02:38.492
Yesterday's lunch
in the kitchen.

02:38.494 --> 02:40.327
Pepperoni pizza.

02:40.329 --> 02:41.779
There's only two slices.

02:41.781 --> 02:43.197
Wait, no. Hold on.

02:43.199 --> 02:44.898
Uh, guys.
Hold on a second.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.367
You've got to
give this a shot,

02:46.369 --> 02:49.620
because this...is a game...

02:51.957 --> 02:53.624
Wow, that is...

02:53.626 --> 02:54.959
that's terrible.

03:06.138 --> 03:07.521
The victim was

03:07.523 --> 03:11.275
Civilian Naval Technology
Scientist Kevin Stone.

03:11.277 --> 03:14.111
He was already
in critical condition

03:14.113 --> 03:16.530
because of a
random auto accident

03:16.532 --> 03:18.649
when the ambulance
was attacked.

03:18.651 --> 03:20.401
So, somebody wanted
him extra dead.

03:20.403 --> 03:22.403
Yeah. Why the knife?

03:22.405 --> 03:23.654
Could suggest
something personal.

03:23.656 --> 03:24.938
Yeah, the gun's
more efficient

03:24.940 --> 03:26.940
but it doesn't have the
same psychological effect

03:26.942 --> 03:27.941
the killer wants.

03:27.943 --> 03:29.943
So, revenge,
crime of passion?

03:29.945 --> 03:30.995
Maybe.

03:30.997 --> 03:32.630
This looks like it was
shot on a smartphone.

03:32.632 --> 03:35.232
Exact-a-mondo.

03:35.234 --> 03:36.283
It was uploaded
to a private

03:36.285 --> 03:37.501
file-sharing Web site
this morning.

03:37.503 --> 03:40.421
After the crime report
came in from the LAPD,

03:40.423 --> 03:43.891
we picked some curious
chatter about a "sick" video.

03:43.893 --> 03:46.510
Uh, it seemed a little
too similar, so we hacked in.

03:46.512 --> 03:48.262
And what do we
know about Stone?

03:48.264 --> 03:51.965
He was working on surveillance
and security projects

03:51.967 --> 03:53.701
for the past six years.

03:53.703 --> 03:55.269
He is single, lives alone,

03:55.271 --> 03:57.988
uh, no disciplinary or
criminal record.

03:57.990 --> 03:59.373
Anything on the killer?

03:59.375 --> 04:00.357
You're looking at it.

04:00.359 --> 04:01.859
This is the only
footage we have.

04:01.861 --> 04:03.277
Lot of questions.

04:03.279 --> 04:05.746
In the top three would be
why post it?

04:05.748 --> 04:07.248
Who shot it?

04:07.250 --> 04:09.483
Who's the killer and
why did he do it?

04:09.485 --> 04:10.484
That's four.

04:10.486 --> 04:12.253
Questions, because
yours was a two...

04:12.255 --> 04:14.154
Doesn't matter.

04:14.156 --> 04:16.173
And all of them very good.

04:16.175 --> 04:19.176
It's just that we're
in the answer business.

04:19.178 --> 04:21.462
So, Mr. Callen, Mr. Hanna,

04:21.464 --> 04:25.299
I've informed
Stone's supervisor

04:25.301 --> 04:27.852
that you'll be paying him
a visit at the Naval Lab.

04:30.639 --> 04:34.225
Mr.Deeks, Ms. Blye,
Rose will have

04:34.227 --> 04:38.112
a preliminary forensics report
by the time you arrive.

04:38.114 --> 04:39.846
On it.
Done.

04:39.848 --> 04:42.283
And now, the dynamic duo.

04:42.285 --> 04:43.684
Survey says?

04:43.686 --> 04:46.487
Uh, tracing the
Web poster's I.D.

04:48.790 --> 04:51.492
Good answer.

04:52.494 --> 04:54.828
Stone was one of our
best and brightest.

04:54.830 --> 04:57.331
Dedicated, good attitude.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.382
Any unusual
behavior lately?

04:58.384 --> 04:59.633
Anything that would
be described

04:59.635 --> 05:00.734
as out of the ordinary?

05:00.736 --> 05:01.635
Not that I saw.

05:01.637 --> 05:02.887
He had been working
hard lately.

05:02.889 --> 05:04.338
I think he was looking
forward to London.

05:04.340 --> 05:05.256
London?

05:05.258 --> 05:06.490
Yeah, a technical
conference

05:06.492 --> 05:08.075
he was going to
attend this week.

05:08.077 --> 05:09.710
What was Stone working on?

05:09.712 --> 05:12.479
Mostly reconnaissance and
surveillance projects.

05:12.481 --> 05:14.348
Anything particularly sensitive?

05:14.350 --> 05:16.150
No, standard methods
of gathering intel.

05:16.152 --> 05:18.602
He was developing tools to
streamline the process.

05:18.604 --> 05:19.820
All low-level stuff.

05:19.822 --> 05:21.405
Sounds vague.

05:21.407 --> 05:25.826
Truth is, 99% of our work
is actually pretty mundane.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.080
Mmm. Yummy.

05:30.082 --> 05:31.732
Ugh.

05:32.701 --> 05:36.236
Liver: 1.5 kilograms.

05:36.238 --> 05:37.371
I love liver.

05:37.373 --> 05:40.007
Always have, ever since
I was a little kid.

05:40.009 --> 05:41.241
Can't really explain it,

05:41.243 --> 05:42.509
but liver and onions,

05:42.511 --> 05:43.260
liver and bacon,

05:43.262 --> 05:44.244
fried
chicken livers...

05:44.246 --> 05:45.746
Dude, just stop.

05:45.748 --> 05:47.298
You hate liver?

05:47.300 --> 05:48.882
I hate liver.

05:48.884 --> 05:50.718
Not unlike the vast
majority of Americans,

05:50.720 --> 05:52.219
who don't have an appreciation

05:52.221 --> 05:54.271
for the smooth
and silky texture

05:54.273 --> 05:55.589
of a slightly
gamey organ meat

05:55.591 --> 05:57.591
usually cooked medium rare
and served with a side of...

05:57.593 --> 05:59.426
All right, I'm going
to be sick, Deeks.

05:59.428 --> 06:00.711
I'm going to be sick.

06:00.713 --> 06:02.730
Have you heard from Nate?

06:02.732 --> 06:03.597
He's in Europe.

06:03.599 --> 06:04.815
But he says he's well.

06:04.817 --> 06:06.951
Aside from his
particular dislike

06:06.953 --> 06:09.486
of braised tripe.

06:09.488 --> 06:11.822
Okay, can we dispense with
the food talk, Deeks?

06:11.824 --> 06:15.075
Does he have any
new... friends?

06:15.077 --> 06:18.162
Um, well he's been undercover
so we don't really know much

06:18.164 --> 06:19.697
about his personal life.
Sorry.

06:19.699 --> 06:23.050
But I am sure that he is
thinking of you fondly.

06:23.052 --> 06:24.918
And we will
give him your regards.

06:24.920 --> 06:25.886
Of course.

06:25.888 --> 06:27.421
So, the stab wound

06:27.423 --> 06:28.789
was the cause
of death?

06:28.791 --> 06:31.342
In combination with the injuries
he suffered in the accident.

06:31.344 --> 06:35.279
But there was something curious
about the stab wound.

06:35.281 --> 06:38.315
There was already
scarring in the region.

06:38.317 --> 06:40.467
Like he'd already been
stabbed there before?

06:40.469 --> 06:41.752
It's too clean for that.

06:41.754 --> 06:44.521
This looks like it was from
some kind of minor surge.

06:44.523 --> 06:48.642
There's interior scarring as
well, and a gap in the tissue.

06:48.644 --> 06:50.861
Like something
was inside of him.

06:50.863 --> 06:52.863
Implanted inside of him?

06:52.865 --> 06:54.815
Yeah, very possibly.

06:54.817 --> 06:57.568
And the killer
carved it out.

07:00.539 --> 07:03.123
Thanks, Kens.

07:05.877 --> 07:09.330
The killer took something
out of Stone's body.

07:10.348 --> 07:12.266
What do you mean,
out of his body?

07:12.268 --> 07:14.268
Something small that was
put in surgically.

07:14.270 --> 07:18.138
How about you tell us what Stone
was really working on, huh?

07:24.012 --> 07:25.846
It was the latest prototype

07:25.848 --> 07:28.065
of a highly advanced
intelligence device.

07:28.067 --> 07:29.733
A major breakthrough
in surveillance

07:29.735 --> 07:32.536
and intelligence gathering.

07:34.039 --> 07:36.540
Go on.

07:37.492 --> 07:39.526
If it gets into the
hands of our enemies,

07:39.528 --> 07:41.211
it not only could be
a serious problem

07:41.213 --> 07:43.047
for U.S. security
interests,

07:43.049 --> 07:45.416
but it'll set our program
back at least five years.

07:45.418 --> 07:48.669
Well, I guess that's the
one percent that not mundane.

07:59.141 --> 08:01.524
The technology is
called I-SWEEP.

08:01.526 --> 08:05.561
Intelligent Small World
Enemy Encroachment Proxy.

08:05.563 --> 08:07.563
It's about the size
of an aspirin.

08:07.565 --> 08:09.949
With some of the motors as
small as a grain of sand.

08:09.951 --> 08:12.318
There's a micro-solar
cell on top.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.452
It supplies the power.

08:13.454 --> 08:15.921
Several vibrating legs
allow for movement,

08:15.923 --> 08:18.440
including one that
acts as a sensor.

08:18.442 --> 08:20.192
Relays information
for surveillance

08:20.194 --> 08:21.276
and intelligence
gathering.

08:21.278 --> 08:22.662
We're looking
at the future.

08:22.664 --> 08:24.330
Today, it's automatic
checkout counters

08:24.332 --> 08:25.331
replacing cashiers.

08:25.333 --> 08:26.332
10 years from now,

08:26.334 --> 08:28.050
robots'll be
doing our jobs.

08:28.052 --> 08:30.886
Maybe they'll program the robots
to pick a decent food truck.

08:30.888 --> 08:33.972
This may look like
science fiction,

08:33.975 --> 08:35.424
but make no mistake--

08:35.426 --> 08:39.562
the military's been developing
this technology for years.

08:39.563 --> 08:40.629
It's a game-changer.

08:40.631 --> 08:42.481
Well, right now,
it could be a game-changer

08:42.482 --> 08:43.599
for the highest bidder.

08:43.601 --> 08:45.234
Indeed, Mr. Callen.

08:45.236 --> 08:49.188
If one of our enemies was
to acquire this device,

08:49.190 --> 08:51.941
it's doubtful they'd be
able to manufacture it.

08:51.943 --> 08:57.079
They could develop technology
to render it ineffective.

08:57.081 --> 08:59.782
The device had been in a secure
vault in the tech lab

08:59.784 --> 09:01.951
for several weeks, while they
developed testing procedures.

09:01.953 --> 09:03.485
And Stone was one of
several scientists

09:03.487 --> 09:04.587
working on the project,

09:04.589 --> 09:06.672
any of whom could have
had access to the vault.

09:06.674 --> 09:07.840
And if it went missing,

09:07.842 --> 09:09.959
Stone knew all of them would
have been searched.

09:09.961 --> 09:11.460
But they probably weren't
going to be looking

09:11.462 --> 09:12.628
under his skin.

09:12.630 --> 09:15.831
LAPD delivered the
contents of Stone's car.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.883
It included a suitcase
and a plane ticket.

09:17.885 --> 09:19.552
He was on his way
to the airport

09:19.554 --> 09:20.803
when he got into
the accident.

09:20.805 --> 09:22.588
He was supposed to be going
to London for a conference.

09:22.589 --> 09:25.259
Only he was stopping
in Istanbul first.

09:25.610 --> 09:26.976
Turkey.

09:26.978 --> 09:29.845
Right next
door to Iran.

09:29.847 --> 09:32.448
Have we I.D.'d the
smartphone shooter?

09:32.450 --> 09:34.400
Uh, yeah.
Lance Eddings,

09:34.402 --> 09:36.569
26-- dropped out of
high school at 16.

09:36.571 --> 09:38.571
Mostly does
odd jobs to get by.

09:38.573 --> 09:40.656
Uh, social services
records indicate

09:40.658 --> 09:42.992
he was abandoned by his
family at age three.

09:42.994 --> 09:44.744
He spent the remainder
of his childhood

09:44.746 --> 09:47.997
in various
foster homes.

09:47.999 --> 09:49.832
He is currently living
in a low-income apartment

09:49.834 --> 09:50.916
in Hollywood.

09:50.918 --> 09:52.051
We'll check out
Stone's apartment.

09:52.053 --> 09:53.803
Kensi, Deeks, see if
you can find Lance.

09:53.805 --> 09:55.221
Or his smartphone.
Okay.

09:55.321 --> 09:57.141
Eric, we need FISA
warrants all around.

09:57.241 --> 09:58.607
Got it.

10:02.545 --> 10:05.014
Never ceases to amaze me, G.

10:05.016 --> 10:07.683
A man dedicates himself to
developing technology

10:07.685 --> 10:11.437
to keep his country safe,
only to sell it out.

10:11.439 --> 10:12.655
Why?

10:12.657 --> 10:14.607
Day trading, for one.

10:14.609 --> 10:18.060
Stocks, currencies, futures.

10:18.062 --> 10:20.529
Looks like he has accounts with
several online brokerage firms.

10:20.531 --> 10:22.364
Was he doing that bad?

10:22.366 --> 10:26.252
Well, bad enough he doubled down
on some pretty risky securities.

10:26.254 --> 10:28.788
He was probably
desperate.

10:36.930 --> 10:38.848
Vicodin and Keflex.

10:38.850 --> 10:41.350
A painkiller and an antibiotic.

10:41.352 --> 10:45.604
Two medications you'd
take after a surgery.

10:45.606 --> 10:48.090
Prescribed two weeks ago.

10:48.092 --> 10:51.477
Which is about the time Rose
said the incisions were made.

10:51.479 --> 10:53.929
Who's the doctor?

10:53.931 --> 10:57.533
Dr. Adam Keller.

10:57.535 --> 11:00.619
Westside Beautification
Center.

11:04.791 --> 11:08.410
I think it's time to remove
those frown lines, Sam.

11:13.583 --> 11:14.783
Thank you.

11:14.785 --> 11:17.036
You, uh, look like
you got something

11:17.038 --> 11:18.420
on your mind.

11:18.422 --> 11:20.155
Listen, Kensi,
we're partners--

11:20.157 --> 11:22.091
you can ask me anything.

11:22.093 --> 11:24.894
Donny and Marie? Really?
Sam. Damn it!

11:24.896 --> 11:27.062
So he says.
All right, listen, here's the deal.

11:27.064 --> 11:28.797
We were in line,
waiting for coffee,

11:28.799 --> 11:29.932
and I was bored,

11:29.934 --> 11:31.150
so I just absentmindedly
started humming,

11:31.152 --> 11:32.818
and I was feeling...
A little bit country.

11:32.820 --> 11:34.303
And a little bit
rock and roll.

11:34.305 --> 11:35.404
Is that so wrong?

11:35.406 --> 11:36.906
Does that make me
a bad person?

11:36.908 --> 11:38.674
Not at all.
Just a little bit creepy.

11:38.676 --> 11:41.527
Oh, good, then that doesn't change
anything between us.

11:41.529 --> 11:43.478
106.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.663
Our videographer's
apartment.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.985
NCIS. Open up.

11:52.672 --> 11:53.822
Ready?

11:56.693 --> 11:58.493
Federal agents!

11:59.262 --> 12:01.347
Clear!

12:01.349 --> 12:02.798
Clear.

12:09.505 --> 12:11.974
Lance is a surfer.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.978
Wow, your powers of
observation are astounding.

12:15.980 --> 12:19.348
No robot is ever
gonna replace you, Kens.

12:21.184 --> 12:24.570
"To my little bro. Sonny."

12:24.572 --> 12:26.538
That's Sonny Amador.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.540
Who's Sonny Amador?

12:28.542 --> 12:31.526
Are you kidding me?
He's, like, a surfing legend.

12:31.528 --> 12:33.295
Well, look at these.

12:33.297 --> 12:35.214
He's a conspiracy theorist.

12:35.216 --> 12:38.367
"The truth the government
doesn't want you to know."

12:38.369 --> 12:39.919
Looks like wiping out

12:39.921 --> 12:41.703
wasn't the only thing
Lance was worried about.

12:41.705 --> 12:43.555
So where did he go?

12:43.557 --> 12:45.090
Where every surfer goes

12:45.092 --> 12:47.176
when he wants to escape
his problems.

12:48.595 --> 12:51.546
He took his board.

12:51.548 --> 12:53.732
How's your beach body?

12:55.986 --> 12:58.237
That's a
nice shot, Jerry.

12:59.357 --> 13:00.572
You're up, Bill.

13:00.574 --> 13:02.992
Still waiting
on Davis, yeah?

13:02.994 --> 13:06.078
The starter confirmed what the
doctor's receptionist told us.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.248
He has a standing foursome
every Thursday on his day off.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.833
Only, today, he never showed.

13:10.835 --> 13:13.252
Yeah, no one saw him in
the clubhouse, either.

13:13.254 --> 13:16.455
Although one of the regulars
thought they saw him pull up earlier.

13:16.457 --> 13:18.040
What do you think?

13:19.259 --> 13:22.211
Damn it! Fore!
He lifted his head.

13:22.213 --> 13:24.713
Maybe the most ridiculous
game ever invented.

13:24.715 --> 13:26.598
It's a metaphor
for life, Sam.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.968
Nothing to react to
but your own actions.

13:28.970 --> 13:30.419
Doesn't look like fun.

13:30.421 --> 13:32.638
It's just you, the ball,
the course and your thoughts.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.257
No one to throw the ball to,
no one to catch it...

13:35.259 --> 13:37.226
You just stare down your fears.

13:37.228 --> 13:39.561
Didn't take you
for a golfer, G.

13:39.563 --> 13:41.596
Never played a day in my life.

13:41.598 --> 13:43.315
Too scary.

13:43.317 --> 13:45.401
So, what does
the good doctor drive?

13:45.403 --> 13:48.320
Eric said it was a
charcoal gray Prius.

13:51.624 --> 13:53.608
Got to love L.A.

13:53.610 --> 13:55.944
You got a plate?

13:55.946 --> 13:57.830
I do.

13:57.832 --> 14:01.083
2-Quebec-Romeo-India...

14:01.085 --> 14:03.836
4-4-5.

14:09.893 --> 14:11.226
Got it.

14:14.630 --> 14:16.498
What do we got?

14:18.234 --> 14:21.770
Looks like a hole in one.

14:30.834 --> 14:34.570
So, here's an amazing
coincidence... not.

14:34.572 --> 14:37.256
Semih Demir--
a high-ranking officer

14:37.258 --> 14:38.925
in the Turkish
Diplomatic Service.

14:38.927 --> 14:40.643
Homeland flagged him

14:40.645 --> 14:43.096
coming in from Istanbul
this morning.

14:43.098 --> 14:44.564
Mr. Demir is suspected of being

14:44.566 --> 14:46.048
more than a little chummy

14:46.050 --> 14:51.220
with a certain network
of Iranian intelligence agents,

14:51.222 --> 14:52.922
feeding them U.S. intel

14:52.924 --> 14:56.692
which he culls
from his diplomatic connections.

14:56.694 --> 14:58.411
And one of those Iranian agents

14:58.413 --> 15:00.329
specializes
in surveillance technology.

15:00.331 --> 15:01.581
The Turkish government

15:01.583 --> 15:03.499
is well aware of
the accusations,

15:03.501 --> 15:05.501
but Mr. Demir is
highly respected.

15:05.503 --> 15:07.954
There's no hard evidence,
so their hands are tied.

15:07.956 --> 15:10.289
And now he's here,
the day after a plan

15:10.291 --> 15:13.092
to smuggle a classified device
out of the country falls apart.

15:13.094 --> 15:15.261
You guys on him?

15:15.263 --> 15:18.414
He hasn't checked in to
a hotel, hasn't rented a car,

15:18.416 --> 15:20.349
at least not in
his own name.

15:20.351 --> 15:21.584
We're monitoring facial rec,

15:21.586 --> 15:23.219
credit card hits
and traffic cams.

15:23.221 --> 15:25.521
And how's our progress
with tracking down

15:25.523 --> 15:27.473
our videographer, Lance Eddings?

15:27.475 --> 15:29.091
According to neighbors
at his apartment,

15:29.093 --> 15:32.228
he spends most his weekends
with Sonny Amador and his boys.

15:32.230 --> 15:33.762
Did you look
into Sonny, Eric?

15:33.764 --> 15:35.314
Yep.
Who's Sonny Amador?

15:35.316 --> 15:38.317
Dude, Sonny Amador,
former world-class surfer.

15:38.319 --> 15:41.737
He's a two-time champ of the
U.S. Open at Huntington Beach.

15:41.739 --> 15:43.806
He was the real deal, man.

15:43.808 --> 15:47.043
We're talking one of the kings
of pipeline on the North Shore,

15:47.045 --> 15:48.494
dominated Todos Santos
in the mid-'90s,

15:48.496 --> 15:51.130
and was always in the top ten
of the world tour

15:51.132 --> 15:53.583
until a knee injury
sidelined him in 2002.

15:53.585 --> 15:55.635
And that's when
he started collecting records

15:55.637 --> 15:57.303
of a different kind.

15:57.305 --> 15:59.088
Yeah, uh, several arrests

15:59.090 --> 16:01.340
for low-level weed dealing
and petty theft,

16:01.342 --> 16:02.657
and one for fraud.

16:02.682 --> 16:04.725
Yeah, he and his crew
counterfeit-labeled

16:04.796 --> 16:07.580
cheap surfboards and tried
to pass them off, um,

16:07.582 --> 16:09.298
claiming his brand
endorsed them.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.151
Not exactly <i>Point</i>
<i>Break,</i> are they?

16:12.153 --> 16:13.152
No.

16:13.154 --> 16:14.520
Nonetheless, it would seem

16:14.522 --> 16:17.657
Mr. Eddings should be found
in their company.

16:17.659 --> 16:19.308
He's our best chance

16:19.310 --> 16:21.310
to find this missing
surveillance technology.

16:21.312 --> 16:22.645
Given his paranoid profile,

16:22.647 --> 16:24.914
I think he's gonna be more
than a little skittish.

16:24.916 --> 16:26.115
Perhaps it's time

16:26.117 --> 16:28.984
for you to break out
your Sex Wax, Mr. Deeks.

16:28.986 --> 16:30.419
All right.

16:30.421 --> 16:32.255
Ew.

16:32.257 --> 16:34.823
Relax, Ms. Blye.

16:34.825 --> 16:37.343
It's just surfboard wax.

16:37.345 --> 16:38.536
Oh.

16:38.561 --> 16:40.586
Maybe you better
brush up on your lingo

16:40.598 --> 16:43.832
if you're going to back him up.
Yeah.

16:45.602 --> 16:47.770
Hang loose, bro.

16:53.110 --> 16:55.010
Good luck with that.

16:55.012 --> 16:56.679

you doing here!

18:21.265 --> 18:22.765
You're on my beach!

18:22.767 --> 18:24.433
Locals only, bro!

18:25.402 --> 18:27.236
Just hold on!

18:27.238 --> 18:29.071
Just hold on for two seconds!

18:29.073 --> 18:30.656
Quit...!

18:31.441 --> 18:33.492
Sonny, hold on a second, man!

18:33.494 --> 18:35.244
I came here to meet you!
You're the reason I started

18:35.246 --> 18:36.796
surfing in the first place--
just hear me out.

18:36.798 --> 18:39.782
All right? Huntington, 1999.
You were in the finals,

18:39.784 --> 18:41.133
and you were losing, right,
and there was

18:41.135 --> 18:42.251
only a minute left on the clock,

18:42.253 --> 18:44.954
and this set
came out of nowhere.

18:44.956 --> 18:46.255
You remember this, huh?

18:48.509 --> 18:51.977
And you paddled out...
to the horizon, you turned,

18:51.979 --> 18:53.312
and you dropped into
this huge barrel.

18:53.314 --> 18:54.814
You put, like, three
fingers in the wall

18:54.816 --> 18:56.349
and you were so deep
inside that tube

18:56.351 --> 18:57.966
that no one thought
you were ever coming out.

18:57.968 --> 19:01.020
And when you did,
you we going so fast...

19:01.022 --> 19:03.689
I shot the pier.
...you shot the pier.

19:03.691 --> 19:05.691
Straight tens from the judges.

19:05.693 --> 19:09.078
Listen, man, I just came here
to interview you.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.830
Interview for what?

19:10.832 --> 19:12.147
I do a surfer's blog.

19:12.149 --> 19:14.617
Bro, I just...
I just wanted to highlight you

19:14.619 --> 19:16.202
for this week, that's it.

19:21.008 --> 19:22.091
Beers on this dude!

19:22.093 --> 19:23.125
That's fine.

19:23.127 --> 19:24.877
I'll buy beers.
All right, brah.

19:26.381 --> 19:27.713
And that was Oahu?

19:27.715 --> 19:29.098
North Shore.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.217
Judges cheated me
out of a trophy.

19:31.219 --> 19:33.636
Said my heat was over.

19:33.638 --> 19:35.688
That sucks.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.225
Bartender.
Hey.

19:39.227 --> 19:40.860
Could I have...

19:40.862 --> 19:44.647
Hi. Mind if I, uh,
buy you a drink?

19:45.816 --> 19:48.033
She likes me;
just wait for it.

19:48.035 --> 19:50.736
I'm thinking that

19:50.738 --> 19:54.790
you're kind of a
Mojito type, yeah?

19:54.792 --> 19:57.660
Bartender, what's your
most expensive drink?

19:57.662 --> 20:02.164
Uh, that would be
the Partida Elegante Anejo.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.799
That's 50 bucks
a shot.

20:03.801 --> 20:08.220
Huh. Actually, I'm the Par...
Partida Elegante

20:08.222 --> 20:09.338
Anejo type?

20:09.340 --> 20:10.673
Yeah.
Is that your type?

20:10.675 --> 20:12.057
Yeah.
Yeah?

20:13.877 --> 20:16.762
Let's make it a
double, shall we?

20:16.764 --> 20:18.931
Ooh.
Yes, sir.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.951
As I like to call it:

20:21.953 --> 20:23.686
"Daily Double""

20:27.574 --> 20:29.275
Well done, Mr. Deeks.

20:29.277 --> 20:30.743
But let's not blow

20:30.745 --> 20:33.362
the whole case budget
in the first hour, shall we?

20:33.364 --> 20:35.798
I'd hate to have to
move the decimal point

20:35.800 --> 20:36.916
on your next paycheck.

20:36.918 --> 20:39.452
Yeah, those mani-pedis
don't come cheap.

20:39.454 --> 20:41.754
Forensics report

20:41.756 --> 20:43.539
just came in
on Dr. Keller.

20:43.541 --> 20:45.424
Anything
of particular interest?

20:45.426 --> 20:46.759
Maybe.

20:46.761 --> 20:48.711
There were traces of
aluminum silicate on the car seat--

20:48.713 --> 20:50.496
that's the same substance
that was in the ambulance

20:50.498 --> 20:52.348
when Stone was killed.

20:52.350 --> 20:54.416
Right.
Aluminum silicate,

20:54.418 --> 20:57.153
when mixed with water,
creates clay.

20:57.155 --> 20:59.588
For sculpting?
Or pottery.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.807
I just got a hit
on Demir's credit card.

21:01.809 --> 21:05.694
Ali Baba-- it's a Turkish
restaurant in Hollywood.

21:05.696 --> 21:06.862
Got it.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.714
The most competitive food truck
scene in the country--

21:25.716 --> 21:27.650
that's the best
he can come up with?

21:27.652 --> 21:29.752
Food trucks are supposed
to be about food, G.

21:29.754 --> 21:31.837
Yeah, especially if
they all serve shrimp curry.

21:31.839 --> 21:34.006
Never said it had
to be shrimp curry.

21:34.008 --> 21:35.474
Chicken's okay, too.

21:35.476 --> 21:37.593
It's so nice
to see you all again.

21:37.595 --> 21:38.794
What you like?

21:43.267 --> 21:46.569
Please excuse me.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.822
What can I do for you?

21:49.824 --> 21:52.491
You seen this man recently?

21:52.493 --> 21:54.476
Doesn't look familiar.

21:54.478 --> 21:56.495
He used his credit card here
an hour ago.

21:56.497 --> 21:57.830
Name's Semih Demir.

21:57.832 --> 21:59.147
We have many customers.

21:59.149 --> 22:01.166
Their private lives
are their own business.

22:01.168 --> 22:03.536
So you're saying he was here.

22:04.838 --> 22:06.989
We'd like to take a look
in your back room.

22:06.991 --> 22:08.457
Do you have a warrant?

22:08.459 --> 22:10.509
I don't think we have a warrant.
Do we have a warrant?

22:10.511 --> 22:12.545
No warrant.
You know what we do have, Sam?

22:12.547 --> 22:14.162
We have the phone number
for the department

22:14.164 --> 22:15.764
that gives out
food truck licenses.

22:15.766 --> 22:18.333
Like the stupid Nut Truck.
Exactly.

22:18.335 --> 22:19.772
A kebab truck would
make much more sense.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.187
Four or five of them.

22:21.188 --> 22:23.839
Parked outside this restaurant
during the dinner hours.

22:23.841 --> 22:27.276
Semih is a friend
of my family in Istanbul.

22:27.278 --> 22:29.945
He needed a car,
so I loaned him mine.

22:29.947 --> 22:31.063
Where was he going?

22:31.065 --> 22:33.198
I have no idea.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.785
Now, please,
leave my restaurant.

22:39.039 --> 22:41.824
Do you have any
questions about the menu?

22:44.160 --> 22:46.695
Nice guy.

22:46.697 --> 22:49.131
The inside of
the barrel dropped out,

22:49.133 --> 22:50.416
and I was shooting

22:50.418 --> 22:51.867
like a rocket toward the reef.

22:51.869 --> 22:54.053
Didn't even have time
to get my hands up. Bam!

22:54.055 --> 22:55.838
Head first.
Ouch.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.841
You! I know you
from somewhere, bro.

22:58.843 --> 23:00.643
Where do I know you from?

23:00.645 --> 23:03.596
Harvard Business School?

23:05.483 --> 23:06.849
No, you kook.

23:06.851 --> 23:09.335
I arrested that guy
couple years back.

23:09.337 --> 23:10.552
Uh-oh.

23:12.989 --> 23:15.274
Lance just walked in;
keep smiling.

23:15.276 --> 23:16.358
So, uh,

23:16.360 --> 23:17.693
I'll handle
the drunk guy,

23:17.695 --> 23:19.495
and you go chat it up
with Lance,

23:19.497 --> 23:20.746
preferably outside, got it?

23:20.748 --> 23:24.249
I'm gonna need
a reason to leave you for him,

23:24.251 --> 23:25.801
so I'm gonna
start an argument.

23:25.803 --> 23:27.569
No, I got a better idea.

23:29.255 --> 23:30.756
Aah!
Ouch.

27:35.993 --> 27:39.995
We know you recorded

And we also know
that you posted that video

you deleted it off your phone.

28:23.457 --> 28:26.491

28:26.493 --> 28:28.543

you can tell us

28:28.545 --> 28:30.695

28:30.697 --> 28:32.931
What he looked like, what kind
of car he was driving...

28:32.933 --> 28:36.101
Yes.
Yes, what?

28:36.103 --> 28:38.103
I know what he looks like.

28:38.105 --> 28:40.288
I followed him home.

28:40.290 --> 28:44.309
I know where he lives.

28:48.314 --> 28:52.317
I don't see him,
but this is the place.

28:54.872 --> 28:58.073
- Nothing yet.
- How long we gonna wait?

30:00.888 --> 30:04.189
Mostly dealing-- small amounts
of meth is the worst of it.

30:04.191 --> 30:06.191
So the Iranians reach out
to a cartel

30:06.193 --> 30:08.443
and give the job to some
low-level street hustler?

30:08.445 --> 30:09.978
That doesn't
make any sense.

30:09.980 --> 30:13.448
Well, cartels use guys
like this on some jobs, sure.

30:13.450 --> 30:15.283
Not for something on this level.

30:15.285 --> 30:18.403
I'm going to have to join
the doubt parade here.

30:18.405 --> 30:20.438
I just checked
Martinez's Facebook page.

30:20.440 --> 30:23.375
He was at a <i>quinceanera</i>
when the murder took place.

30:23.377 --> 30:25.577
He was tagged
in a dozen photos.

30:27.330 --> 30:28.914
Lance.

30:28.916 --> 30:31.616
He's playing us.

30:42.345 --> 30:43.783
The supposed killer
you led us to

30:43.784 --> 30:46.318
is a street dealer
with an alibi.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.921
Who are you protecting?

30:50.273 --> 30:51.857
Okay, the man
with the knife

30:51.859 --> 30:53.626
has classified
military technology,

30:53.628 --> 30:56.161
technology he's going to sell
to enemies of this country.

30:56.163 --> 30:58.597
You're making that up.
Why would we do that?

30:58.599 --> 31:00.499
Because you're part of it.
What, the great

31:00.501 --> 31:02.218
government conspiracy?
Authority has

31:02.220 --> 31:05.137
always attracted the lowest
element in the human race.

31:05.139 --> 31:06.939
They will submit
to any indignity,

31:06.941 --> 31:10.559
perform any vile act,
do anything to achieve power.

31:10.561 --> 31:12.778
Every government is...
Is "a parliament of whores."

31:12.780 --> 31:15.180
P.J. O'Rourke.
I love him.

31:15.182 --> 31:16.532
But it's fiction.

31:16.534 --> 31:19.818
And fiction reveals truths
that reality obscures.

31:19.820 --> 31:21.987
Ralph Waldo Emerson--
and he also said that

31:21.989 --> 31:23.472
"truth is beautiful,
without a doubt,

31:23.474 --> 31:24.990
but so are lies."

31:29.079 --> 31:32.381

get stabbed to death.

31:32.383 --> 31:34.533
Don't you think that's wrong?

31:34.535 --> 31:36.719
Don't you?

31:38.421 --> 31:39.871
You have 20 minutes.

31:39.873 --> 31:42.241
After that,
you're gonna go to prison

31:42.243 --> 31:43.709
for obstruction of justice.

31:43.711 --> 31:45.544
You know, maybe
he'll get lucky.

31:45.546 --> 31:46.812
Maybe they'll put him in Lompoc.

31:46.814 --> 31:49.214
Oh.
You know what's great about Lompoc?

31:49.216 --> 31:51.400
You get a little
glimpse of the surf

31:51.402 --> 31:53.402

in the prison yard.

31:54.271 --> 31:56.739
I want to talk to Sonny.

31:56.741 --> 31:59.158
Why?
Because I do.

32:13.090 --> 32:15.207
He's in over his head,
and he knows it.

32:15.209 --> 32:17.075
If he doesn't come clean soon,
that microbotic device

32:17.077 --> 32:18.744
is gonna be
on its way to Iran.

32:18.746 --> 32:20.296

32:23.884 --> 32:26.001
in Malibu Canyon,
just a few hours ago.

32:26.003 --> 32:27.636
Shot to death.

32:27.638 --> 32:29.421
That's a hell of a coincidence.

32:29.423 --> 32:31.256
Sonny must have a
connection to this.

32:31.258 --> 32:34.226
Well, he's certainly got
a connection to Lance.

Think this'll break him?

32:39.817 --> 32:42.434
Sonny was Lance's
emotional safety net.

32:42.436 --> 32:44.269
He was like
an older brother to him.

32:44.271 --> 32:46.538
Now with Sonny gone,
Lance has no one.

32:46.540 --> 32:50.626
It might just shut
him down completely.

33:05.091 --> 33:08.143
The man in the ambulance,
the one you're protecting,

33:08.145 --> 33:11.146
we think he did
this to Sonny.

33:27.197 --> 33:30.249
How many foster placements
did you have, Lance?

33:31.084 --> 33:33.452
Nine.

33:33.454 --> 33:36.105
I had 37.

33:42.462 --> 33:46.632
For me, the good ones
were the hardest.

33:46.634 --> 33:50.469
You start to feel
a little bit at home...

33:50.471 --> 33:52.337
make a friend...

33:52.339 --> 33:55.057
Sleep through the night.
Yeah.

33:55.059 --> 33:57.893
Yeah, that was great, wasn't it?

34:00.513 --> 34:02.815
And then something would happen.

34:02.817 --> 34:05.401
And they'd ship you off.

34:06.236 --> 34:09.405
Usually not to someone so nice.

34:12.190 --> 34:14.860
Only, this time,
you don't let anyone in...

34:14.862 --> 34:18.196
'cause it's too risky.

34:23.503 --> 34:26.588
But here's the thing, Lance...

34:26.590 --> 34:29.891
we're not
in foster homes anymore.

34:29.893 --> 34:33.062
Sometimes we have to
remind oures...

34:33.063 --> 34:37.232
we're not that helpless
little kid anymore, either.

34:37.234 --> 34:39.768
We need to find
the son of a bitch

34:39.770 --> 34:41.904
that did this to Sonny.

34:46.993 --> 34:49.161
I called Sonny,

34:49.163 --> 34:52.030
told him what I saw
in the ambulance,

34:52.032 --> 34:54.783
that I got video of it.

34:54.784 --> 34:58.370
He told me to send it
to him, so I did.

34:58.372 --> 35:01.406
Sonny thought
we could get some money.

35:01.408 --> 35:04.293
He told me to follow the guy.

35:04.295 --> 35:06.244
I left a note on his car

35:06.246 --> 35:08.881
telling him to check out
the Web site.

35:08.883 --> 35:10.349
We posted just enough video

35:10.351 --> 35:13.051
to show him we could
screw him if we wanted.

35:13.053 --> 35:15.304
Sonny went to Malibu.

35:15.306 --> 35:17.606
to trade the footage
for a payoff.

35:17.608 --> 35:22.144
I led you to the wrong guy
so we could pull it off.

35:27.700 --> 35:31.770
Sonny said we could get,
like, 50 grand.

35:31.772 --> 35:35.457
He said that
he'd take me to Hawaii.

35:35.459 --> 35:38.210
We'd live it up.

35:38.212 --> 35:41.530
Surf pipeline every day.

35:50.523 --> 35:53.392
I downloaded Lance's video
from Sonny's cell phone.

35:53.394 --> 35:55.644
The killer is...

35:55.646 --> 35:58.096
Clint Sears, 45.

36:02.135 --> 36:04.786
Convictions for fraud,
and a Homeland file

36:04.788 --> 36:06.655
connecting him
to Al Qaeda-friendly players.

36:06.657 --> 36:08.690
And I've got
credit card records here

36:08.692 --> 36:12.244
that show Sears
and our Naval scientist, Stone,

36:12.246 --> 36:13.745
frequenting the same restaurant

36:13.747 --> 36:15.864
half a dozen times
over the past month.

36:15.866 --> 36:17.699
Sears must be the middleman

36:17.701 --> 36:20.169
between Stone
and the buyer Demir.

36:20.171 --> 36:22.153
And he was probably
following him to the airport

36:22.155 --> 36:23.717
to make sure he got on
the plane when Stone got

36:23.742 --> 36:25.625
into the car accident.

36:25.626 --> 36:27.626
So, to save the deal,
he ambushes the ambulance

36:27.628 --> 36:29.178
and cuts the device out of him.

36:29.180 --> 36:30.662
Is this his current address?

36:30.664 --> 36:33.832
It is.
And his computer is on.

36:33.834 --> 36:37.002
Remote-accessing it now.

36:39.171 --> 36:42.140
Hm. Doesn't seem to be
any current activity.

36:42.142 --> 36:43.675
He could just be away
from his computer.

36:43.677 --> 36:46.211
He could, but I
don't think so.

36:46.213 --> 36:48.747
Uh, the last Web site
that he visited

36:48.749 --> 36:51.200
was a traffic check,
two hours ago.

36:51.202 --> 36:53.151
Where to?
Calabasas.

36:53.153 --> 36:54.286
Oh.

36:54.288 --> 36:56.488
I also got a hit
on Demir's car.

36:56.490 --> 36:59.274
He was headed north
on PCH 30 minutes ago.

36:59.276 --> 37:01.192
That's the quickest way
from this side of the hill.

37:01.194 --> 37:04.162
That's lot of ground to cover
and not a lot of time,

37:04.164 --> 37:06.248
if Sears
is already there.

37:06.250 --> 37:09.134
There's not a lot of
traffic cams in the hills, so...

37:09.136 --> 37:11.470
chances are slim that
we'll get another hit.

37:11.472 --> 37:13.589
Got something else.

37:13.591 --> 37:14.923
Looks like Sears
has entered

37:14.925 --> 37:17.643
several amateur
ceramic competitions.

37:17.645 --> 37:19.244
The aluminum silicate.

37:19.246 --> 37:20.913
Says here he's a member of

37:20.915 --> 37:23.265
Agave Ceramic Studio
in Calabasas.

37:23.267 --> 37:26.535
Got it-- Agave Studio,
Palmwood Drive.

37:26.537 --> 37:28.737
That would be familiar
territory for Mr. Sears.

37:28.739 --> 37:31.490
He'd know the layout
should things go wrong.

37:31.492 --> 37:32.891
Demir's halfway to Malibu.

37:32.893 --> 37:35.410
LAPD can't detain him
'cause of his diplomatic status.

37:35.412 --> 37:38.880
Well, that's not the only way
to slow him down.

38:12.031 --> 38:13.782
Eric, we're approaching
Agave Studios.

38:13.784 --> 38:14.766
Copy that.

38:14.768 --> 38:16.068
What about Demir?
