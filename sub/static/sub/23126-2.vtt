WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.625
- Previously on Being Human

00:02.670 --> 00:04.991
- You shouldn't have to run into
the woods everytime you turn.

00:05.030 --> 00:08.693
- How could 4 walls and a toilet
possibly help this?

00:08.740 --> 00:11.232
- There was an engaged couple
living here. She died.

00:11.270 --> 00:13.034
- In here?
- Someone's in the house?

00:13.080 --> 00:14.809
- You can hear me?
- Yeah.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.172
She's a ghost.
- Shut up.

00:17.210 --> 00:19.008
- How did you die?
- I have no idea.

00:19.050 --> 00:20.415
- The point of this house

00:20.450 --> 00:23.442
was having one place
where we can be human.

00:25.190 --> 00:27.409
- Hey, it's me.
I need your help.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.383
- Good to see you back, Aidan.

00:30.230 --> 00:32.095
- There's Bishop and there's me.

00:32.130 --> 00:34.349
- Emily? Sorry.
- Josh?

00:34.400 --> 00:37.392
What are you doing? Josh!
- Go!

00:37.430 --> 00:38.864
No...

00:38.900 --> 00:41.392
My sister's here
and the door is locked.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.704
I will kill her.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.844
- (Sally):
Life is a series of choices.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.885
As it turns out,
death isn't the same.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.024
Not for the ones who are ready.

01:11.070 --> 01:14.529
They embrace their fate,
move on.

01:14.570 --> 01:18.108
For the rest of us,
we linger.

01:18.140 --> 01:22.145
After our survivors pray
and throw dirt on our coffins,

01:22.180 --> 01:23.705
we're still waiting,

01:23.750 --> 01:28.312
because for some of us,
there's a bigger question...

01:29.920 --> 01:32.457
>

01:42.030 --> 01:43.828
What am I now?

01:45.970 --> 01:47.768
Where do I go from here?

02:22.040 --> 02:23.963
>

02:29.550 --> 02:33.180
- We find ourselves
in an eternal nowhere,

02:33.220 --> 02:35.109
between human...

02:36.120 --> 02:37.679
and thing.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.158
(Explosion in distance)

02:42.190 --> 02:44.488
(Man screaming in distance)

02:45.960 --> 02:47.689
(Horse whinnying)

02:50.630 --> 02:52.837
(Explosion)

02:52.870 --> 02:54.599
(Breathing heavily)

02:54.640 --> 02:56.699
Monsters.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.539
- (Man): Hey! Hey, we got
something alive over here!

02:59.580 --> 03:01.605
(Indistinct chatter on radio)

03:01.640 --> 03:03.847
- Some of these monsters choose

03:03.880 --> 03:06.520
to simply accept
what they've become.

03:06.550 --> 03:10.919
- (Woman on radio): Roger that.
Ambulance is on its way.

03:10.950 --> 03:12.952
** If I look mad...

03:12.990 --> 03:14.719
- Some don't.

03:19.130 --> 03:20.757
(Explosion)

03:20.800 --> 03:22.598
* Think back

03:24.500 --> 03:25.922
- Oh!

03:28.470 --> 03:31.565
* Think back...

03:34.180 --> 03:36.103
(Insects chirping)

03:36.140 --> 03:39.474
- Which leaves us with
the most important choice.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.511
(Screaming)

03:45.420 --> 03:47.309
Do you accept what you are?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.112
Or do you refuse?

03:49.160 --> 03:50.559
- Ahh!

03:50.590 --> 03:53.423
Ahh!

03:55.500 --> 03:56.865
(Panting)

04:09.510 --> 04:11.547
And which is the true curse?

04:11.580 --> 04:13.309
(Roaring)

04:16.790 --> 04:18.849
(Panting)

04:18.890 --> 04:20.755
(Breathing heavily)

04:23.030 --> 04:24.384
- Where am I?

04:25.430 --> 04:26.591
Oh...

04:26.630 --> 04:28.359
What is this?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.368
- Everything's fine.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.367
I promise.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.539
You just need a bite to eat.

04:33.570 --> 04:35.390
- Where's Aidan?

04:35.440 --> 04:38.865
- He'll be so happy
that you're here.

04:40.510 --> 04:41.671
- Aidan?

04:43.150 --> 04:44.504
Are you here?

04:46.210 --> 04:48.850
Aidan!

05:00.530 --> 05:03.693
(Grunting)

05:03.730 --> 05:04.765
- Ahh!

05:04.800 --> 05:06.666
- Josh?

05:06.700 --> 05:08.190
You're scaring me.

05:08.240 --> 05:11.460
- Just stay away from me!

05:11.510 --> 05:14.878
(Grunting, screaming)

05:17.480 --> 05:20.939
(Intense beating)

05:26.420 --> 05:28.889
(Cell ringing)

05:35.860 --> 05:36.827
(Screaming)

05:36.870 --> 05:38.622
- Do you want me to...

05:38.670 --> 05:40.195
Can I get you help?

05:40.240 --> 05:42.663
<i>- Stay away from me!</i>

05:43.540 --> 05:46.532
(Screaming)

05:50.450 --> 05:52.179
Aidan, I'm in the room.

05:52.210 --> 05:54.474
It's locked,
and Emily's here.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.511
If you get this, please...

05:57.590 --> 06:00.309
(Screaming)

06:07.360 --> 06:09.158
(Screams)

06:09.200 --> 06:10.929
- Josh!

06:10.970 --> 06:12.062
(Crying)

06:12.100 --> 06:13.568
(Door slams shut)

06:16.270 --> 06:20.104
(Screaming)

06:22.010 --> 06:25.776
(Roaring)

06:27.120 --> 06:29.441
- What do you mean,
"He has a condition"?

06:29.490 --> 06:32.346
- He's your brother.
You should ask him yourself.

06:32.390 --> 06:34.916
- My brother had
a nervous breakdown

06:34.960 --> 06:36.587
and ran away from
his family 2 years ago.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.086
He doesn't tell me anything.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.326
If he's in
some kind of trouble--

06:40.360 --> 06:42.328
- No, no, no.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.692
He's a good guy.
He's a great roommate.

06:44.730 --> 06:47.939
He's dealing with
some stuff, yeah, but...

06:49.270 --> 06:50.601
aren't we all?

06:52.540 --> 06:55.373
- Does he...
Does he have any friends?

06:55.410 --> 06:57.504
- Josh? You kidding me? Yeah.

06:57.550 --> 07:00.349
- 'Cause he never really did.

07:00.380 --> 07:02.542
- Oh, come on.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.347
OK, he's quirky.

07:06.390 --> 07:07.619
- You think?

07:07.660 --> 07:09.958
- He talks about you,
you know.

07:09.990 --> 07:13.528
Um, what he said...

07:13.560 --> 07:18.464
was that he always studied
so hard learning medicine,

07:18.500 --> 07:20.332
how to save a life,

07:20.370 --> 07:24.967
but that you were the one
who knew how to truly live.

07:27.710 --> 07:29.200
- Did he say that?

07:35.920 --> 07:39.242
I... I can't believe
my sweet brother went mad.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.888
Our mother did,
too, you know.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.149
Bet he didn't
tell you that.

07:47.330 --> 07:49.355
Yeah, you wouldn't know it now.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.665
She's back on the tennis court-
book club circuit.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.340
The incident has been
neatly filed away.

07:55.370 --> 07:57.304
Just our little
family curse.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.970
- I think we're all
a little cursed that way.

08:03.010 --> 08:04.171
- Please.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.746
You're hot!

08:05.780 --> 08:08.477
(Woman chattering on PA)

08:08.520 --> 08:10.488
(Inhales, exhales)

08:10.520 --> 08:14.058
- What can I do for you?
Can I call somebody?

08:14.090 --> 08:16.923
- Jackie's waiting
for me upstairs.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.827
God, what if he never even
gets to meet Jackie?

08:21.800 --> 08:23.495
I really wanted to
rub it in his face

08:23.530 --> 08:26.739
that I ended up
with a shiksa goddess.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.101
** It's like you said

08:32.140 --> 08:34.234
* This is way too tough

08:34.280 --> 08:39.446
* We've got no way to
make it out there all alone

08:39.480 --> 08:42.211
* Out there on our own

08:44.390 --> 08:47.917
* When times get tough,
you got my back

08:47.960 --> 08:50.156
* Don't know what I'd do

08:50.190 --> 08:53.854
* Without you,
I'd be all alone

08:53.900 --> 08:56.323
* Out there on my own

08:57.800 --> 08:59.063
(Door closing)

09:00.940 --> 09:01.930
- How are you?

09:03.770 --> 09:07.536
- Well, I didn't
kill my sister...

09:07.580 --> 09:10.641
so I guess
I can't complain.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.469
- Josh, I'm really sorry.
I tried. I just...

09:15.950 --> 09:17.611
couldn't.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.650
- It's OK.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.158
- Really?

09:24.190 --> 09:25.351
- Sure.

09:25.390 --> 09:29.668
I mean, I don't even know
what I expected you to do.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.266
(Exhales)

09:34.800 --> 09:36.029
What?

09:36.070 --> 09:38.664
- Figuring out an acceptable
amount of time to pass

09:38.710 --> 09:40.678
before I tell you something.

09:40.710 --> 09:41.939
OK.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.971
Danny's coming over.

09:44.010 --> 09:45.341
- What?

09:45.380 --> 09:47.712
- And I'm really glad
you didn't kill your sister.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.639
- What? Aidan!

09:49.690 --> 09:52.819
Aidan, why--why is
Danny coming over?

09:52.860 --> 09:55.283
- Sally really,
really wanted to see him.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.186
- Poh!
- Sorry.

09:57.230 --> 10:01.758
- OK, am I the only one who thinks that
Danny coming over is a tremendously bad idea?

10:01.800 --> 10:02.892
What if he sees you?

10:02.930 --> 10:05.467
- I'll crap rainbows,
I swear to God!

10:05.500 --> 10:07.867
- She's a ghost.
He ain't gonna see her.

10:07.900 --> 10:12.804
Well, wait, sometimes
they do see them, normal people.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.605
But he would have to be,
you know, open, mentally.

10:15.640 --> 10:16.801
- Danny's pretty open.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.272
He voted for Hillary.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.316
- It's fine.

10:20.350 --> 10:21.715
- OK, look, if he sees you,

10:21.750 --> 10:25.209
if he senses you, do you have
any idea what that would do to him?

10:25.250 --> 10:28.515
What it would do to us? He could
sell the place! He could raise it.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.721
He could sell tickets

10:29.760 --> 10:32.422
like that guy who saw Jesus
on the taco shell!

10:32.460 --> 10:34.497
Listen, if he comes,

10:34.530 --> 10:38.524
I think that Sally
should stay upstairs.

10:38.570 --> 10:40.959
- And I think that
you don't get a say.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.676
On the stairs.
At least!

10:46.710 --> 10:48.599
(Knocking on door)

10:51.280 --> 10:53.248
- Top of the stairs.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.441
And no peeking!

10:57.620 --> 10:59.588
- Oh, just...

10:59.620 --> 11:01.486
don't be weird, OK?

11:01.520 --> 11:04.023
- Yeah, I got it.
- You too, Amityville.

11:04.060 --> 11:05.528
Top of the stairs.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.951
Everyone just be... normal.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.798
- Got it.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.230
(Exhaling)

11:18.270 --> 11:19.635
- Hey.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.832
(Exhales)

11:21.880 --> 11:24.679
- (Irish accent): Top of
the morning to you, captain!

11:24.710 --> 11:27.111
(Laughing)

11:29.650 --> 11:32.347
Oh jeez!

11:38.530 --> 11:42.194
- So, do you wanna check out
the sink first, or...

11:47.640 --> 11:49.961
- I'm just gonna go
check on the...

11:50.010 --> 11:51.330
- Wait, upstairs?

11:51.370 --> 11:54.169
But the breakers
are in the basement.

11:54.210 --> 11:56.338
- Yeah, right,
it's in the basement.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.371
Sure, but I've got
a lot of stuff.

11:58.410 --> 12:00.549
There's stuff plugged in
upstairs that I've got for work.

12:00.580 --> 12:03.186
A lava lamp, radio.
Probably too many things.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.314
A power strip plugged into
another power strip...

12:05.350 --> 12:08.058
- So, the sink...

12:12.260 --> 12:13.421
- What are you doing?

12:13.460 --> 12:14.552
- Just let me see him.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.125
What if that's
the closure I need?

12:16.160 --> 12:17.366
- What if it's not?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.822
What if it only
makes you feel worse?

12:18.870 --> 12:21.066
Trust me, as bad as
you feel now,

12:21.100 --> 12:23.102
there's always worse, OK?

12:24.370 --> 12:26.099
So could you just...

12:26.780 --> 12:28.236
Ah...

12:28.280 --> 12:29.873
- OK.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.677
- Do you know
what you're doing?

12:33.720 --> 12:35.017
- Hal

12:35.050 --> 12:36.939
You know, when I
bought this place,

12:36.990 --> 12:39.448
I thought, hey, this is
a perfect opportunity

12:39.490 --> 12:42.357
for me to learn how to
fix stuff, you know?

12:42.390 --> 12:44.119
And then I had to move out.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.720
Everyone who moved in
complained about the plumbing.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.626
And yeah...

12:49.600 --> 12:51.022
I still have no idea.

12:52.130 --> 12:53.336
I'm gonna have to...

12:53.370 --> 12:55.134
come back with some books.

12:55.170 --> 12:56.592
- Good enough.

12:56.640 --> 13:00.736
- Hey, look, I know this place
has a certain...

13:00.780 --> 13:02.532
- Character?

13:02.580 --> 13:05.504
- Yeah, but it's been OK
here for you guys?

13:05.550 --> 13:07.973
Nothing... Nothing weird's
happened or anything?

13:08.020 --> 13:10.148
- Define weird.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.579
- Well, just things
people have said

13:12.620 --> 13:15.157
since I moved out,
that it's...

13:15.190 --> 13:17.921
I don't know, creepy.

13:20.230 --> 13:21.891
- I wouldn't say that.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.464
- We like creepy.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.763
- I think every home
has an echo

13:28.800 --> 13:30.837
of the people who
lived there before.

13:32.910 --> 13:34.378
- Yeah.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.075
I guess I never really
thought of it like that.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.579
- There's a good echo here.

13:45.850 --> 13:47.511
- I, uh...

13:49.860 --> 13:51.089
How did she...

13:52.360 --> 13:55.352
If you don't mind
my asking...

13:56.400 --> 13:58.425
- Yeah, how did she die.

14:00.670 --> 14:02.331
We'd just moved in.

14:03.740 --> 14:05.902
And the electrical was all...

14:05.940 --> 14:08.375
well, you know...

14:09.340 --> 14:12.947
We watched, um...
Marley & Me,

14:12.980 --> 14:14.277
but she made me
turn it off

14:14.320 --> 14:17.244
when he had trouble
getting up the stairs.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.315
We went up to bed.

14:19.350 --> 14:20.749
She had this thing

14:20.790 --> 14:23.623
where she would always get up
to go to the bathroom

14:23.660 --> 14:25.924
the second
she got into bed.

14:28.260 --> 14:31.423
And there was no light
in the hall, and...

14:32.800 --> 14:34.996
she turned the wrong way.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.633
And...

14:37.370 --> 14:41.102
- She went...
down the stairs.

14:43.910 --> 14:47.016
- Yeah, when she didn't
come back to bed,

14:47.050 --> 14:48.973
I went to see
if she was OK.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.018
Then I found her.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.719
Right there.

15:06.130 --> 15:07.598
- (Aidan): I'm sorry.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.809
I can't imagine the shock.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.979
- No, it's OK.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.478
Thanks.

15:18.850 --> 15:21.820
- What was she like?

15:21.850 --> 15:23.648
- Ha! Sally?

15:25.720 --> 15:27.711
She was amazing!
She was...

15:27.760 --> 15:32.186
She lit up the place, you know,
everywhere she went!

15:32.230 --> 15:35.450
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

15:39.100 --> 15:42.138
But that's for VH1
Behind the Music, right?

15:42.170 --> 15:44.537
- Were you in a band or...

15:47.910 --> 15:51.369
- I'm, uh, gonna come back
for that sink.

15:54.850 --> 15:57.649
** A hollow metal arrow

15:59.290 --> 16:01.611
* Fell to the water

16:01.660 --> 16:05.051
* It must have come down
from the blast

16:05.090 --> 16:08.526
* I gave it to you

16:08.560 --> 16:11.120
* And I watched
as my sand castle

16:11.170 --> 16:14.663
* Slowly was turned
into glass *

16:21.280 --> 16:25.740
- I think we should further
explore what this is.

16:25.780 --> 16:26.804
- I'm sorry?

16:26.850 --> 16:29.069
- This.

16:29.120 --> 16:33.159
I believe Dean Kane
called it "kismet."

16:33.190 --> 16:34.510
- When?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.756
- 90210...

16:36.790 --> 16:38.155
season 3...

16:38.190 --> 16:40.352
He said it to Shanon Doherty.

16:41.530 --> 16:43.669
Oh my God,
I'm older than you!

16:43.700 --> 16:46.089
- I don't think so.

16:46.130 --> 16:50.067
- So, you live near that bar
on Commonwealth, right?

16:50.110 --> 16:53.000
- Yeah, me and Josh
live around there.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.110
You know Josh.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.837
- Oh, the orderly. Right.

16:56.880 --> 17:00.373
I think when we met,
he curtsied.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.649
(Laughing)

17:01.680 --> 17:03.512
- Did he?

17:03.550 --> 17:04.915
- Yeah.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.949
(Intense beating)

17:08.990 --> 17:12.585
(Aidan breathing heavily)

17:15.099 --> 17:17.694
- Ah...

17:17.730 --> 17:18.800
- You OK?

17:18.829 --> 17:20.969
- Yeah, I've just been
trying to quit smoking.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.729
One too many pieces
of nicotine gum.

17:22.770 --> 17:24.169
- Oh.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.861
But you can
still drink, right?

17:26.910 --> 17:30.972
Because I was thinking that
maybe we could go to that bar

17:31.010 --> 17:32.409
sometime after work.

17:32.450 --> 17:36.569
- Cara, full disclosure.
I'm not a lot of fun.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.590
- Oh no, me neither.

17:40.220 --> 17:42.279
I'm, like, the opposite.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.556
- OK, well, I got rounds.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.857
- Sure. Great.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.233
Don't wanna keep
the bedpans waiting!

17:56.700 --> 17:57.735
Unh!

18:23.570 --> 18:24.560
- Ah!

18:28.040 --> 18:29.030
Rebecca?

18:29.070 --> 18:30.708
- Did you just wet your pants?

18:31.740 --> 18:33.777
A little bit?

18:33.810 --> 18:35.175
- People are worried
you're dead.

18:35.210 --> 18:36.769
There's a search.

18:36.810 --> 18:40.519
- Not a very good one.
I'm here, geniuses.

18:40.550 --> 18:42.370
- We should call someone.

18:42.420 --> 18:46.311
- Sure, in a minute.
We'll call everybody.

18:47.560 --> 18:51.451
Ah! I can't believe I didn't
smell that stink a mile away!

18:51.490 --> 18:53.652
Are you a werewolf?

18:55.060 --> 18:58.496
Ah, gross!
It's in my hair!

18:59.830 --> 19:01.332
- You're a vampire?

19:01.370 --> 19:04.340
- Oh, that's right.
You live with Aidan.

19:04.370 --> 19:06.805
Twisted little halfway house
you two are running.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.672
- Aidan...

19:08.710 --> 19:11.350
- Oh, there you go.
The wheels click.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.075
You're a smart little doggie,
aren't you?

19:13.110 --> 19:15.841
Yes, you are!
Yes, you are!

19:15.880 --> 19:18.042
- Aidan did this.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.059
- Ooh...

19:21.090 --> 19:23.286
You look so surprised.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.049
I'd watch myself if I were you.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.499
- Hey!

19:37.540 --> 19:39.429
- Hey. What's wrong?

19:39.470 --> 19:41.370
- You turned her
into a vampire.

19:41.410 --> 19:42.809
- What?
- Don't do that!

19:42.840 --> 19:45.502
Don't pretend like you don't
know what I'm talking about!

19:45.550 --> 19:47.848
- Josh...
- Rebecca.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.348
- Just...

19:50.950 --> 19:52.816
Rebecca's dead.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.579
- Oh! Oh...

19:55.620 --> 19:57.258
Is that right?

19:58.230 --> 20:00.426
I thought she was missing!

20:00.460 --> 20:03.430
She just jumped me outside.

20:05.570 --> 20:07.231
You had to turn Rebecca.

20:07.270 --> 20:09.364
- Josh...
- Stop lying, Aidan!

20:09.400 --> 20:10.936
- I swear I didn't know.

20:10.970 --> 20:13.007
- You didn't know what?

20:13.040 --> 20:15.839
That you turned her
into a monster

20:15.880 --> 20:17.848
or that she'd be
such a good one?

20:17.880 --> 20:21.373
No, what's the point
of any of this,

20:21.420 --> 20:23.047
of playing house,

20:23.080 --> 20:25.242
of--of drinking beers,

20:25.290 --> 20:27.987
of joining Costco

20:28.020 --> 20:31.058
if you're just gonna
kill all our friends?

20:32.590 --> 20:34.957
(Exhales)

20:56.250 --> 20:57.547
- Welcome to Sapp & Sons.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.685
May I help you plan a special
goodbye for your loved one?

21:00.720 --> 21:03.883
- What did you do with her?
- You're gonna have to be more specific.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.560
I had a busy night.
- Where is she?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.250
- Lunch break.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.826
I assume she's out
catching a bite to eat.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.964
- Boys, boys.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.308
You're both pretty.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.502
- What did you do?

21:19.540 --> 21:20.701
- I know life is long,

21:20.740 --> 21:23.744
but let's not waste our time
with rhetorical questions.

21:23.780 --> 21:25.145
You asked for our help.

21:25.180 --> 21:27.444
I think we went
above and beyond.

21:27.480 --> 21:31.542
- I called for a cleanup.
You had no right to turn her.

21:31.590 --> 21:34.082
- Listen to yourself.
So selfish.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.009
- I asked you for a favour.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.950
- Yes, you did, and it's
not often that you ask.

21:38.990 --> 21:40.697
It's not often that you slip.

21:40.730 --> 21:43.768
So when you do,
well, forgive us,

21:43.800 --> 21:45.928
but we just wanted to see for
ourselves what was so special.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.439
- She is quite a find.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.768
- A little wild, though.

21:52.070 --> 21:53.902
But we'll forgive you that.

21:53.940 --> 21:57.103
Perhaps you can assist us
in breaking her.

21:57.140 --> 21:59.108
- Where is she?

22:01.180 --> 22:03.046
- She seems to like the park.

22:03.080 --> 22:06.186
Shady trees, pretty flowers,
happy people.

22:06.220 --> 22:09.713
Light breeze carrying
the scent of fresh meat.

22:11.290 --> 22:13.952
We worked hard on
her orientation, Aidan.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.630
Don't go putting silly ideas
into her head.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.702
(Blowing)

22:23.740 --> 22:25.265
- Come on.

22:29.310 --> 22:31.199
(Knocking on door)

22:31.250 --> 22:33.105
Hello?

22:38.790 --> 22:40.451
(Door unlocking)

22:47.130 --> 22:49.952
- Guys? Hello?

22:50.730 --> 22:52.789
It's Danny!

23:27.970 --> 23:30.337
- Are you OK?

23:30.370 --> 23:31.701
- Are you?

23:34.210 --> 23:36.872
A friend said
you had a condition.

23:39.180 --> 23:42.673
Hey, are you...
Are you mad at me, Josh?

23:42.720 --> 23:44.017
- What? No.

23:44.050 --> 23:46.439
- Then why won't
you talk to me?

23:47.520 --> 23:51.320
I told you something
that I hadn't told anyone.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.829
Next thing I knew,
you were gone.

23:53.860 --> 23:55.999
- I'm so sorry.

23:56.030 --> 23:57.100
- It's me, Josh.

23:57.130 --> 24:00.259
What is such a secret
that you can't tell me?

24:01.670 --> 24:04.230
I saw it yesterday,
didn't I?

24:04.270 --> 24:07.035
Or does it get worse?

24:07.070 --> 24:10.802
- This was a mistake.
I should leave you alone.

24:10.850 --> 24:14.969
- No. No. We're here.
We're talking.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.580
What did you say to Julia?

24:17.620 --> 24:18.781
- Nothing.

24:18.820 --> 24:21.619
- If you didn't wanna marry her
and go to med school...

24:21.660 --> 24:23.526
- No, no, Em, it wasn't...

24:25.260 --> 24:27.957
It wasn't that.
Something happened to me.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.196
- What?

24:30.230 --> 24:32.289
- It's dangerous, Em.

24:32.330 --> 24:33.832
My life...

24:34.840 --> 24:38.367
Yes, it gets worse.
It gets much, much worse.

24:38.410 --> 24:41.175
- Look, Jackie and I
are going home tomorrow.

24:41.210 --> 24:45.204
I'm not letting you
leave us again.

24:45.250 --> 24:46.740
- I almost killed you.

24:46.780 --> 24:48.441
- I don't care.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.984
Let me help you, Josh.

24:52.020 --> 24:54.785
Please, come with us.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.423
(Exhales)

25:14.210 --> 25:15.837
(Exhales)

25:18.910 --> 25:20.742
- What the hell am I doing?

25:20.780 --> 25:22.646
- I don't know.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.911
Danny, seriously,
call a plumber.

25:25.950 --> 25:29.215
I'm the one who fixed
the toilet last time!

25:38.630 --> 25:41.600
That time you brought me
breakfast in bed...

25:44.240 --> 25:46.561
the morning
after you proposed...

25:50.340 --> 25:51.739
(Laughs)

25:51.780 --> 25:54.010
You got the tray
all the way up the stairs

25:54.050 --> 25:57.372
and then you dropped everything
when you got in the bedroom.

25:57.420 --> 26:01.288
You chipped the mug.
Points for effort, though.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.780
Why do you always come to
fix things by yourself?

26:06.830 --> 26:08.298
Is it me?

26:09.900 --> 26:11.720
Are you looking for me?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.561
"Cause I might not
be here forever.

26:17.610 --> 26:18.566
Or maybe I will.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.874
Maybe you'll get sick
of playing plumber

26:20.910 --> 26:22.332
and you'll sell the place

26:22.380 --> 26:25.008
and marry and heiress
and move to Connecticut,

26:25.050 --> 26:27.405
and I'll be stuck here
haunting monsters.

26:28.720 --> 26:29.846
(Sighs)

26:29.880 --> 26:31.882
Danny!

26:34.020 --> 26:35.658
Danny!

26:35.690 --> 26:38.421
Do you even care?

26:38.460 --> 26:40.519
. Oh my God!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

26:40.560 --> 26:43.120
- Whoa! Whoa!
What the hell?

26:43.160 --> 26:45.060
- It just happened!
I don't know!

26:45.100 --> 26:47.637
- I just got upset. I'll fix it.
I'll figure it out.

26:47.670 --> 26:48.990
I'll think happy thoughts.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.394
- I better call a plumber.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.466
- Know what'll make me happy?
Tell Danny to stop ignoring me!

26:53.510 --> 26:56.434
- Maybe we should just shut off
the main line for now.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.448
Yeah, yeah,
I'll get it on the way out.

26:58.480 --> 27:01.518
I'm really sorry.
I'll send somebody over.

27:13.960 --> 27:14.950
(Door closing)

27:26.370 --> 27:28.839
- Rebecca...
- You don't look nearly surprised enough

27:28.880 --> 27:30.939
to see a girl
you left for dead.

27:30.980 --> 27:34.575
- I don't know where to begin.
- Try.

27:34.620 --> 27:36.145
I've got an eternity.

27:40.220 --> 27:42.484
- I didn't want this for you.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.557
- Better to kill me?
- Rebecca.

27:44.590 --> 27:47.287
- You left me for dead!
- Can we walk?

27:54.670 --> 27:57.731
I don't do this anymore.
I got weak with you.

27:57.770 --> 27:59.204
- And now I'm strong.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.835
You know how terrified I felt
when I woke up in that room,

28:02.880 --> 28:04.006
their eyes on me?

28:04.050 --> 28:05.575
No idea what had happened,

28:05.610 --> 28:07.339
where you were,
what you were.

28:07.380 --> 28:09.314
- If I had any idea
he'd do that to you--

28:09.350 --> 28:11.216
- I get what came over you.
I've got it.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.184
I wanna rip my skin off
half the time.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.881
- T know.
- But the other half...

28:14.920 --> 28:16.615
I feel like a goddess.

28:16.660 --> 28:18.549
So thanks for that.

28:18.590 --> 28:20.024
No.

28:20.060 --> 28:21.289
Thank Bishop.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.794
- He's got
a nice sales pitch.

28:24.830 --> 28:26.127
But once
the high wears off,

28:26.170 --> 28:28.593
it is more gruesome
than you could realize.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.438
We can go away together,
you and me.

28:30.470 --> 28:32.962
- Sure. Bed and
breakfast upstate?

28:33.010 --> 28:34.273
We'll feed off
the leaf peepers.

28:34.310 --> 28:36.301
- I got you into this
so I could teach you.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.776
- Not sure I want advice from the man
who fell off the wagon and into my neck.

28:39.810 --> 28:42.142
- But we can help
each other stay strong.

28:42.180 --> 28:47.858
- Please, I already know the
best way to keep strong is to feed.

28:47.890 --> 28:50.359
What happened to you?

28:50.390 --> 28:53.758
Bishop told me
you were the best.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.723
- I was the worst.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.866
- Well, how can you hate it
so much? Nothing can Kill you.

28:58.900 --> 29:01.961
- That's not true.
- Practically nothing can kill you.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.059
The volume has been
turned up in the world.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.067
I really hear
what people say,

29:06.110 --> 29:07.407
how fast their hearts
are beating.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.478
I can tell you what's for dinner
3 streets away. And my body...

29:10.510 --> 29:15.539
- Yeah, it has its perks. But you have to
remember who you were, who you loved.

29:15.580 --> 29:17.469
- I was pathetic.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.239
I fell into bed with you
after 2 glasses of wine

29:20.290 --> 29:21.951
and 20 minutes of swagger.

29:21.990 --> 29:24.322
To hell with who I loved.

29:25.690 --> 29:27.658
Dad never thought
I'd amount to much.

29:27.690 --> 29:29.397
Wait till I grab him
by the throat

29:29.430 --> 29:30.659
and eat his heart out.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.397
- Listen to me very carefully.
You do not wanna do that.

29:33.430 --> 29:34.966
You will never
forgive yourself.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.889
- All those years
I spent being sorry?

29:36.940 --> 29:38.601
Think how sorry
my sisters will be

29:38.640 --> 29:41.473
when I drain
their babies lifeless.

29:41.510 --> 29:45.242
It'll be the best family meal
we've had in years.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.703
Ha. What?

29:48.750 --> 29:50.377
Jealous?

30:16.540 --> 30:19.271
- I'm sorry.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.443
I guess it takes that

30:26.490 --> 30:29.209
"He doesn't even
know I'm alive" thing

30:29.260 --> 30:31.126
to a whole new level.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.723
- Yeah.

30:35.230 --> 30:37.528
Maybe I'm not
supposed to leave.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.637
- OK.

30:42.670 --> 30:46.368
- You saw it. Maybe
he couldn't see me, but...

30:46.410 --> 30:48.629
he felt something.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.206
How could I not pursue that?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.344
- Because...

30:56.320 --> 30:58.049
you're a monster.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.414
And he's not.

31:01.460 --> 31:02.882
And...

31:05.330 --> 31:06.980
Trust me...

31:09.660 --> 31:11.628
It ends bad.

31:14.970 --> 31:16.938
You know, I was engaged.

31:16.970 --> 31:18.165
- You were?

31:18.210 --> 31:19.336
- Yeah.

31:19.370 --> 31:23.329
I'll try not to take offence
to your extreme shock.

31:23.380 --> 31:26.145
- And she doesn't know?

31:26.180 --> 31:29.172
- What would I say?

31:29.220 --> 31:32.884
I'm... I'm... What?

31:37.390 --> 31:40.360
It's a miracle
I got her to love me once.

31:41.660 --> 31:44.823
- You don't know
how she'd react.

31:49.470 --> 31:51.302
- Sally the Ghost.

31:55.180 --> 31:59.947
That's asking him to swallow
a heck of a lot, don't you think?

32:02.080 --> 32:05.516
- I've been dead for 6 months
with no sign of change.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.755
If he gets scared...

32:11.160 --> 32:12.924
if my feelings get hurt,

32:12.960 --> 32:18.421
if a white light appears
and I walk into it...

32:18.470 --> 32:20.689
what's the harm in trying?

32:20.730 --> 32:23.336
- You really wanna
go through the pain...

32:24.440 --> 32:27.137
of losing him
all over again?

32:30.580 --> 32:32.503
- I'm already dead.

32:40.150 --> 32:42.482
** Bad luck, bad luck

32:42.520 --> 32:45.956
* Came to me without warning

32:48.760 --> 32:51.798
* Bad luck came with love

32:53.130 --> 32:56.430
* From your flashing eye

33:00.070 --> 33:02.778
* In the corners
of the darkness

33:02.810 --> 33:04.574
* Bad luck has lingered...

33:04.610 --> 33:06.578
- Hello.

33:07.650 --> 33:10.142
(Intense beating)

33:10.180 --> 33:13.309
- Cara... hi.
I didn't see you here.

33:13.350 --> 33:15.409
- Yeah, I was just over there
with my friends.

33:15.460 --> 33:19.181
But I thought I'd come over
and say hi.

33:19.230 --> 33:20.755
Which I did.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.758
- Mission accomplished.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.521
- Anyways, I guess I'll just...

33:26.570 --> 33:27.822
- You know what,
I'm sorry.

33:27.870 --> 33:29.031
Um...

33:29.070 --> 33:31.038
Sit and have a drink with me.

33:31.070 --> 33:33.801
* You will never,
ever, ever know *

33:33.840 --> 33:34.910
Sauvignon?

33:34.940 --> 33:36.578
- Yeah!

33:36.610 --> 33:38.499
How did you know?

33:40.150 --> 33:41.709
(Crashing)

33:41.750 --> 33:46.119
(Intense beating)

33:46.150 --> 33:48.050
(Exhaling)

33:50.320 --> 33:52.129
(Cell ringing)

33:56.530 --> 33:57.952
- What?

33:58.000 --> 34:01.095
- What, so we're never speaking
to each other again?

34:02.940 --> 34:04.601
Come to the bar.

34:04.640 --> 34:05.937
- I'm busy.

34:05.970 --> 34:07.438
- Cara's here.

34:07.470 --> 34:09.609
- So?

34:09.639 --> 34:11.608
- So you should come.

34:12.510 --> 34:14.217
- Why?

34:19.120 --> 34:20.985
Aidan, no. Just don't.

34:22.260 --> 34:26.857
- Great. So you'll come then?
- Just... I'll be right there.

34:28.330 --> 34:30.321
- Good.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.690
- Who was that?

34:31.730 --> 34:33.197
- Josh. He's coming over.

34:33.230 --> 34:34.833
- Oh...
- OK, so, where were we?

34:34.870 --> 34:37.498
He asked you if you had
anything in red.

34:37.540 --> 34:38.938
- No, seriously.

34:38.969 --> 34:42.577
And, um, for those of you
keeping track,

34:42.610 --> 34:46.308
that was the 4th pair of shoes!

34:46.350 --> 34:50.674
- You tried on 4 pairs of shoes
for a man with a shoe fetish?

34:52.090 --> 34:55.150
- Or 6 pairs of shoes.

34:55.190 --> 34:56.612
- Oh wow! OK! All right.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.981
Well, I gotta give you credit
for staying with it.

34:59.030 --> 35:02.091
- Oh, why...
Why am I telling you this?

35:02.130 --> 35:03.825
- Oh, well, that's my curse.

35:03.860 --> 35:06.363
Women like to tell me their
most embarrassing stories.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.732
- Well, you go.

35:08.770 --> 35:09.862
You owe me.

35:09.900 --> 35:12.005
- I have nothing that bad.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.239
- Sure you do.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.907
Shove over, babe.

35:17.940 --> 35:20.773
- You shouldn't be here.
- Oh, hush!

35:20.810 --> 35:22.619
She's cute.

35:22.650 --> 35:24.687
What'd I miss?

35:25.690 --> 35:28.011
Mmm! Well?

35:28.860 --> 35:31.010
- I don't know.
- Well, let's see.

35:31.060 --> 35:33.154
You told your sad
little story, right?

35:33.190 --> 35:34.749
Now Aidan will
tell you his,

35:34.800 --> 35:38.589
and you'll laugh and he'll say
something self-deprecating.

35:38.630 --> 35:39.995
I don't wanna
ruin it for you.

35:40.030 --> 35:42.340
Let's get on with it already.
Am I right?

35:42.370 --> 35:44.429
You'll go back
to your place.

35:44.470 --> 35:45.665
He's selfish that way.

35:45.710 --> 35:48.429
And then he'll give you
some "blah-blah-blah"

35:48.480 --> 35:50.073
about Byron and his curse.

35:50.110 --> 35:51.305
- Rebecca.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.499
- Rebecca?

35:52.550 --> 35:53.949
- Oh...

35:55.280 --> 35:56.770
I think she's got it.

35:56.820 --> 35:58.686
- Leave.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.610
- Hold on. I wanna see her face
when she puts it together.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.957
- Um...

36:02.990 --> 36:06.028
I really shouldn't have
ditched my friends.

36:06.060 --> 36:08.028
So I think I'm just...

36:08.060 --> 36:09.391
<i>** I don't trust you</i>

36:09.430 --> 36:11.489
* And if you flinch
another inch

36:11.530 --> 36:15.467
* Well, I just might
let you drive

36:15.500 --> 36:18.299
* And I'll see
I'll see you

36:18.340 --> 36:20.809
(Laughs)

36:20.840 --> 36:23.309
* And if you sleep
another sleep, well... *

36:23.340 --> 36:25.570
- Just go.

36:26.410 --> 36:27.775
- Come with me.

36:27.810 --> 36:30.745
You said it yourself,
We can help each other.

36:30.780 --> 36:33.613
- I said we can help
each other stay clean.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.585
- Let's get dirty first.
- Rebecca, look...

36:36.620 --> 36:40.124
OK, I already told you no.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.094
- You screw me.
You kill me.

36:42.130 --> 36:43.791
You never call.

36:45.530 --> 36:48.329
You really know how to mess
with a girl's self-esteem.

36:50.300 --> 36:51.301
Ugh!

36:51.340 --> 36:53.308
I'm bored! Hey!

36:55.010 --> 36:56.432
Wanna get out of here?

36:57.680 --> 36:59.000
- Uh, yeah.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.802
- Fantastic. Bye-bye.

37:02.180 --> 37:04.683
- Wait.
- Why? You want in?

37:04.720 --> 37:08.987
- You don't wanna do this. - I'm pretty sure I do.
- You go back to your friends.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.682
You have a drink.
You forget about this one.

37:13.730 --> 37:16.324
Just go home!

37:16.360 --> 37:18.089
- Yeah, OK, OK!

37:21.570 --> 37:23.459
(Man collapsing)

37:23.500 --> 37:27.038
- (Woman):
Just came out of nowhere!

37:27.070 --> 37:28.902
(Car alarm blaring)

37:38.520 --> 37:41.387
- Rebecca?
Ah! Ah!

37:41.420 --> 37:43.457
- Good doggie! Heel!

37:43.490 --> 37:45.083
- Ahh!

37:45.130 --> 37:47.428
(Breathing rapidly)

37:47.460 --> 37:49.349
(Panting)

37:52.270 --> 37:54.659
- Cara. Hey, Cara.

37:54.700 --> 37:55.496
- No, no, no, no, no!

37:57.000 --> 37:59.970
- There's too much blood. There's too much.
- Well, someone had to do it,

38:00.010 --> 38:02.707
and you were taking
your sweet-ass time.

38:02.740 --> 38:05.471
Mmm! I highly recommend
a bar Kkill.

38:05.510 --> 38:08.309
She was sweet. A little oaky
and cheap, but still...

38:08.350 --> 38:11.320
best Saturday night I've had
in a long time.

38:11.350 --> 38:14.285
- If we don't get help,
she's gonna die.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.379
- Oh, don't look so tragic.

38:16.420 --> 38:19.082
Give her a sip.
She'll be fine.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.450
- Is that true?

38:21.600 --> 38:25.127
Can you save her?
- It won't be saving her. - Aw...

38:25.170 --> 38:26.422
That's right.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.440
You prefer to leave
your conquests for dead.

38:29.470 --> 38:31.802
- If you can save her...

38:31.840 --> 38:34.263
please...
- I can't!

38:36.240 --> 38:37.776
I'm sorry.

38:38.880 --> 38:41.713
(Siren in distance)

38:50.260 --> 38:51.887
- So, this is it?

38:53.260 --> 38:54.728
It's over, isn't it?

38:57.630 --> 38:59.291
- No.

39:00.770 --> 39:02.989
- They'll trace
Cara to Rebecca...

39:04.340 --> 39:05.933
and Rebecca to you.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.708
- No.

39:11.140 --> 39:15.179
We're spread so far.
Our networks run so deep.

39:16.450 --> 39:17.576
This happens...

39:17.620 --> 39:19.588
all the time.

39:27.490 --> 39:31.199
_** I can't recall
just what was said

39:32.470 --> 39:34.325
* I won't bring back
the words

39:34.370 --> 39:37.795
* That led to
the breaking down

39:37.840 --> 39:40.036
* And trails of dead

39:41.040 --> 39:43.475
<i>* 1 cannot recall</i>

39:45.450 --> 39:48.420
<i>* I think I had a sweater on</i>

39:49.620 --> 39:51.611
* Maybe just a blanket

39:51.650 --> 39:54.415
* To keep me warm

39:54.460 --> 39:57.282
* When all the blood was gone

39:58.530 --> 40:00.589
<i>* 1 cannot recall</i>

40:11.840 --> 40:14.059
* Do you recall

40:16.240 --> 40:18.607
* What made us fall?

40:20.080 --> 40:23.618
* Was there noise at all?

40:23.650 --> 40:28.019
* Oh, and do you recall

40:37.830 --> 40:40.424
- My life is different now.

40:41.870 --> 40:43.690
I'm different.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.901
You don't wanna know me.

40:46.940 --> 40:48.908
You can't help me.

40:52.780 --> 40:54.100
Just leave me alone.

40:54.150 --> 40:55.948
* And do you recall

40:58.450 --> 41:00.612
* What made us fall?

41:01.620 --> 41:04.851
* Was there noise at all?

41:06.830 --> 41:10.391
* Oh, and do you recall

41:10.430 --> 41:12.569
* Do you recall

41:14.130 --> 41:15.791
* What made us fall?

41:15.840 --> 41:17.467
- Should have turned her,

41:17.500 --> 41:18.865
sweet girl like that.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.264
And a nurse, no less.

41:20.310 --> 41:22.472
That would have
been convenient.

41:22.510 --> 41:26.174
- I'm not interested in making
things convenient for you.

41:26.210 --> 41:30.420
- You and I aren't gonna have
a problem, are we, Aidan?

41:30.450 --> 41:32.680
- Not by me.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.586
- I'm afraid I'm gonna need

41:34.620 --> 41:37.214
a little bit more
reassurance than that.

41:37.260 --> 41:38.955
What's it gonna be?

41:38.990 --> 41:42.358
Us... or them?

41:45.830 --> 41:48.322
- It was never a question.

41:48.370 --> 41:49.963
Not really.

41:51.200 --> 41:55.535
Maybe I am sentenced...

41:55.580 --> 41:57.400
to a life in hell with you.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.478
But here and now...

42:02.420 --> 42:05.117
I choose them.

42:19.100 --> 42:20.920
(Door closing)

42:28.310 --> 42:32.144
- I never really
thought about it before,

42:32.180 --> 42:34.911
how hard he must work

42:34.950 --> 42:38.614
every single second
of his life...

42:38.650 --> 42:41.142
not to be one of them.

42:43.290 --> 42:45.520
I guess I just
take it for granted

42:45.560 --> 42:47.187
he's as good as he is.

42:49.830 --> 42:52.891
- Do you think
he should have saved her?

42:54.640 --> 42:56.130
- I think he did.

42:57.770 --> 43:01.263
** I'm walking
I'm a southern stream

43:01.310 --> 43:05.577
* Get to the river
before I run too low

43:05.610 --> 43:09.274
* I'm walking
I'm a southern stream

43:09.320 --> 43:12.847
* Get to the river
before I run too low

43:21.160 --> 43:25.165
* Old gypsy woman spoke to me

43:25.200 --> 43:29.262
* Lips stained red from
a bottle of wine

43:29.300 --> 43:32.861
* Old gypsy woman spoke to me

43:32.910 --> 43:36.403
* Lips stained red from
a bottle of wine **
