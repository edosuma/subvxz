(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:40.040 --> 00:42.800
DAVID ATTENBOROUGH:
An olive ridley turtle.

00:45.040 --> 00:49.400
She's resting in the shallows
off Costa Rica,

00:52.240 --> 00:55.160
having swum a thousand miles to be here.

01:05.520 --> 01:11.160
All because the eggs she carries
must be laid on dry land.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.400
Now she's returned
to the very same beach

01:21.560 --> 01:24.200
where she hatched 10 years ago.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.840
She must leave the safety
of her marine world

01:39.480 --> 01:42.840
and brave the alien world beyond.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.760
She's heavily laden

02:09.080 --> 02:13.600
but the future of the next generation
of her kind is at stake.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.760
All along the beach in a spectacle
that has remained unchanged

02:25.880 --> 02:27.480
for millions or years,

02:28.280 --> 02:31.400
mother sea turtles emerge from the ocean

02:34.280 --> 02:36.960
in their hundreds of thousands.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.600
Only those animals
that overcome the great challenges

02:52.680 --> 02:54.680
of both land and sea

02:55.000 --> 02:58.760
can make the most of life
here on the coast.

03:24.400 --> 03:29.920
Our shores are places of sudden changes
and rich rewards.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.040
The Galapagos Islands
in the tropical Pacific Ocean.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.480
Their barren coastline
looks inhospitable,

03:45.680 --> 03:50.320
but one group of animals has learnt
to use it to their advantage.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.120
(EXHALES)

04:00.600 --> 04:02.200
(BOTH BARKING)

04:02.280 --> 04:03.560
Sea lions.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.040
Bachelors.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.120
They need to pile on the pounds

04:13.240 --> 04:17.400
as only the biggest males will attract
a female and manage to breed.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.960
If these young bulls
fail to grow big enough,

04:26.640 --> 04:30.760
they will remain exiled
on this isolated shoreline.

04:38.240 --> 04:42.280
So one hungry young bull
heads out alone.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.440
He's on the hunt for big game.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.120
Yellowfin tuna.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.040
Each weighing 60 kilos

05:33.400 --> 05:36.440
with a top speed of 40 miles an hour.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.200
He can't possibly catch one
in the open sea,

05:44.920 --> 05:46.920
but he has a plan.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.600
Ahead lies the entrance to the cove.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.840
He herds them towards it

06:05.640 --> 06:07.120
into his trap.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.040
Driving them into a dead end.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.400
But they give him the slip.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.640
(BARKING)

06:40.720 --> 06:42.080
He's failed.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.800
(CONTINUES BARKING)

06:51.640 --> 06:54.920
But there might be another way.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.880
Now they head off as a team

07:18.760 --> 07:21.600
to round up more tuna,

07:25.440 --> 07:27.960
driving them back into the cove.

07:41.480 --> 07:46.520
The sea lions fan out channelling
the tuna towards the bottleneck.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.400
Once again the tuna hit the dead end.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.080
But this time,
the young bull doubles back

08:11.160 --> 08:14.640
to act as a blocker
sealing off the exit.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.640
This time when the shoal
tries to escape,

08:42.720 --> 08:46.720
he blocks them and drives them back
into the next blind alley.

09:00.560 --> 09:04.120
The gang can now pick them off
one by one.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.240
This clever fishing technique,

09:52.320 --> 09:55.880
demanding foresight,
planning and cooperation,

09:56.480 --> 09:59.800
has only every been seen here
in the Galapagos.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.120
Each massive fish provides them
with five times more protein

10:07.200 --> 10:08.960
than a normal day's hunting.

10:13.760 --> 10:17.080
Finally, the young bull leaves his post

10:20.160 --> 10:22.080
to claim his reward.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.680
(SQUAWKING)

10:37.040 --> 10:39.760
On a diet of protein-rich tuna,

10:39.960 --> 10:44.000
he's well on the way to becoming
a full-sized breeding bull.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.280
By using this cove,

10:53.360 --> 10:57.760
these Galapagos sea lions
have made the most of the opportunities

10:57.840 --> 11:01.520
that occur
where the coast's two worlds meet.

11:10.840 --> 11:15.360
Coasts are the most swiftly changing
of all ocean habitats

11:16.680 --> 11:19.040
because of the tides.

11:27.040 --> 11:32.160
Tides are created as the moon's gravity
pulls at the sea.

11:42.160 --> 11:47.360
As the moon circles our planet,
the seas rise and fall.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.800
Typically twice a day,

11:52.640 --> 11:56.960
creating the most constantly dynamic
landscapes on Earth.

12:07.080 --> 12:12.560
Nowhere else do sea-living creatures
face such changeable conditions.

12:15.600 --> 12:20.280
With the daily risk of drying out
and being scorched by the sun.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.760
Where the tide retreats
across a rocky shore,

12:29.880 --> 12:33.480
it can leave behind a temporary oasis.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.600
A rock pool.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.800
Seemingly, it's a haven of calm.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.720
But not for long.

13:02.600 --> 13:07.480
Turning minutes into seconds
reveals unexpected dramas.

13:20.640 --> 13:25.160
In rock pools, grazers, scavengers
and filter feeders

13:25.240 --> 13:27.960
must all make the most
of the few short hours

13:28.040 --> 13:29.800
before the tide returns.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.840
Anemones gulp down
anything they can reach.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.560
Though some meals
are harder to digest than others.

14:04.760 --> 14:09.360
These magical worlds
soon become battlegrounds.

14:12.920 --> 14:18.680
A deadly predator with five arms
and on the underside a mouth.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.000
The ochre starfish.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.440
And it's in search of limpets.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.120
For some, there is no escape.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.440
But other limpets have a secret defence.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.800
They deploy a slippery shield

15:14.160 --> 15:17.240
which allows them to slide to safety.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.880
And this limpet
has its own personal bodyguard.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.160
A scale worm with a nasty nip.

15:44.120 --> 15:48.160
The starfish prefers food
that doesn't bite back.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.080
The limpet carries on,

15:51.160 --> 15:54.840
its bodyguard
tucked safe under its shell.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.560
But there is one creature

16:00.280 --> 16:03.440
that limpets have no defence against.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.080
A clingfish.

16:09.480 --> 16:13.080
It has teeth
that can lever under the shell

16:14.680 --> 16:17.400
and twist the limpet off
like a bottle top.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.440
The clingfish then swallows it

16:25.040 --> 16:27.000
shell and all.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.280
(GULPS)

16:34.760 --> 16:39.240
Rock pool dramas like these
last just a few short hours

16:39.320 --> 16:41.640
before the tide returns.

16:45.720 --> 16:50.760
Every day the sea becomes land
and the land becomes sea.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.360
Bringing new opportunities.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.720
A Sally Lightfoot crab,

17:09.760 --> 17:14.080
one of thousands of shore crabs
just waiting for their moment.

17:17.200 --> 17:21.240
Every day they gather
on the tropical shores of Brazil,

17:24.040 --> 17:26.800
waiting for the tide to go out.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.120
Which exposes their feeding ground,

17:39.160 --> 17:42.880
seaweed covered rocks,
a hundred metres from the shore.

17:52.840 --> 17:56.440
Getting there is a race
against the tide.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.080
They leap from rock to rock.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.360
These crabs seem
to be afraid of the water.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.320
And for good reason.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.960
The Moray eel.

18:53.120 --> 18:57.080
The chain Moray
is a specialist crab hunter.

19:02.560 --> 19:07.200
It's blunt teeth can easily grip
and crush a crab's shell.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.080
It's the crab's deadliest enemy.

19:26.280 --> 19:29.840
But the crab's feeding grounds
are still a long way off.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.880
They must press on.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.080
Halfway.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.080
But their enemy has other ideas.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.000
Crossing the land

20:23.600 --> 20:26.160
to reset the ambush.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.800
To feed, the crabs must keep going.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.080
But nowhere is safe.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.360
An octopus. Also a crab killer.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.600
The crabs make a dash for it.

21:42.800 --> 21:43.920
Made it.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.720
Risking life and limb

21:55.040 --> 21:58.200
to graze on these seaweed pastures.

22:01.400 --> 22:05.440
But in two hours' time
when the tide starts to turn,

22:06.400 --> 22:09.920
they will have to run the gauntlet
all over again.

22:19.440 --> 22:23.680
Tides are not the only force
to have an impact on the coast.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.880
(WAVES THUNDERING)

22:43.640 --> 22:47.160
The greatest waves
originate far out to sea

22:47.320 --> 22:51.080
and roll in towards the coast,
growing as they come.

23:03.560 --> 23:07.800
As the shallowing sea floor
drags at their underside,

23:08.320 --> 23:11.560
their crests rise
up to a hundred feet high,

23:11.960 --> 23:14.400
topple over and break.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.960
Many of the biggest surfed waves
in the world

23:25.080 --> 23:27.840
are formed off Nazare in Portugal.

23:43.360 --> 23:47.880
Every day along this coast,
the impact of the waves is equivalent

23:47.960 --> 23:51.920
to one and a half million tonnes of TNT.

24:13.680 --> 24:18.520
Wave power gradually moulds
and reshapes our coasts.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.840
In some parts of Europe,

24:23.920 --> 24:28.800
waves wear away as much as three metres
of coastline each year.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.280
The rate at which the waves
reshape the rock

24:39.360 --> 24:41.280
depends on its hardness.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.600
Where soft rock lies below hard,

24:45.720 --> 24:47.840
dramatic arches are craved.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.160
It's an endless assault

25:07.240 --> 25:11.160
that gradually sculpts
vaulted cathedrals of stone

25:11.240 --> 25:13.480
as here in northern Spain.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.960
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

25:25.040 --> 25:28.640
And wave power
creates towering fortresses

25:28.760 --> 25:30.800
like these cliffs in these Arctic,

25:30.880 --> 25:34.560
home to tens of thousands
of breeding seabirds.

25:39.120 --> 25:43.240
The faces of the cliffs
are accessible only from the air

25:43.360 --> 25:47.160
and have plenty of nooks and crannies
for those that can get there.

25:52.240 --> 25:57.000
But to feed, seabirds must still master
the ocean world beyond.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.840
(GULLS SQUAWING)

26:02.160 --> 26:03.240
The puffin.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.600
He's a fisherman...

26:08.680 --> 26:09.960
(SQUAWKING)

26:10.040 --> 26:11.400
...and a father.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.000
He has a mate for life.

26:24.960 --> 26:29.000
Both share the burden of raising
their week-old chick,

26:29.080 --> 26:33.120
their puffling who needs
five square meals a day.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.720
The parents alternate fishing trips.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.040
(CHIRPING)

26:42.040 --> 26:43.680
It's dad's turn.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.240
(SQUAWKING)

27:06.200 --> 27:08.440
When fish stocks are low,

27:08.520 --> 27:12.560
puffins must fly as much as 30 miles

27:13.800 --> 27:16.400
to reach the good fishing grounds.

27:28.400 --> 27:32.360
Once there,
they plunge into another world.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.680
Good fishing spots are hard to come by,
and they have company.

27:46.640 --> 27:47.960
Guillemots.

27:55.280 --> 27:59.080
Like the puffin, their wings are short
and good for diving.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.920
Puffins can hold their breath
for over a minute

28:05.120 --> 28:08.080
and dive as deep as 40 metres.

28:13.320 --> 28:14.720
A catch.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.560
But it's a long way home.

28:39.560 --> 28:43.960
(BIRDS SQUAWKING AND CHIRPING)

28:44.720 --> 28:46.080
(SQUAWKING)

28:49.880 --> 28:54.360
After an exhausting round trip
of almost 60 miles,

28:54.520 --> 28:56.680
this puffin's nearly made it.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.320
But there are pirates on this coast.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.520
Arctic Skuas.

29:31.520 --> 29:35.040
All around returning parents
are being robbed.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.080
The skuas' long rake back wings

30:04.160 --> 30:06.400
make them faster and more manoeuvrable.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.640
Puffins must choose their moment wisely.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.480
A near miss.

31:27.120 --> 31:30.120
A last desperate burst of speed,

31:32.600 --> 31:34.040
and it's made it.

31:40.040 --> 31:45.160
(BIRDS CHIRPING AND SQUAWKING)

32:00.400 --> 32:04.360
Safely home
after a three-hour round trip...

32:09.640 --> 32:11.440
(SQUAWKING)

32:11.720 --> 32:14.320
...where his patient partner is waiting.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.720
(CHIRPING)

32:30.640 --> 32:33.600
Today their puffling will eat.

32:40.320 --> 32:43.080
But where fish numbers are in decline,

32:43.200 --> 32:47.480
many puffins now find it hard
to get enough food for their chicks.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.080
In the changing seas of today,

32:52.200 --> 32:56.080
it can be even harder
to be a successful puffin parent.

33:06.880 --> 33:11.000
Overcoming the challenges
of two worlds is seldom easy.

33:13.040 --> 33:17.600
One marine creature has virtually
abandoned the sea altogether.

33:20.560 --> 33:23.240
On a few remote pacific islands,

33:23.320 --> 33:26.800
lives the most terrestrial fish
on the planet.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.160
At the top of this metre-high
limestone cliff,

33:39.920 --> 33:44.360
an eight-centimetre long blenny
has chosen a nest hole.

33:50.800 --> 33:54.160
Up here, he can graze
on the abundant algae

33:54.280 --> 33:57.320
without any competition
from sea-going fish.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.360
The females are feeding beneath him.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.040
He's keen to attract their attention,

34:10.880 --> 34:13.800
but they are busy moisturising.

34:14.240 --> 34:18.120
Staying damp is essential
as they breathe through their skin.

34:23.120 --> 34:27.440
To make himself conspicuous,
he turns black

34:31.680 --> 34:34.240
and flashes his orange fin.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.640
He catches her eye.

34:40.440 --> 34:43.240
But these Pacific leaping blennies,

34:43.360 --> 34:46.000
seem afraid of the waves.

34:49.360 --> 34:51.280
They're poor swimmers

34:52.120 --> 34:54.400
and will be easy prey in the sea.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.280
Time to try again.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.080
She's tempted.

35:09.040 --> 35:12.680
But once again distracted by a wave.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.680
The male just won't give up.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.800
Finally, she's hooked.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.800
He makes way...

36:01.400 --> 36:04.160
so she can enter his cave.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.040
And he encourages her to lay her eggs

36:11.120 --> 36:13.760
with his seductive dance.

36:28.040 --> 36:32.320
He then fertilizes them
in the safety of his nest.

36:42.800 --> 36:46.840
The blenny has given up the sea
for a life on land.

36:49.160 --> 36:53.040
Others have made
an even more successful move

36:53.120 --> 36:55.480
but in a different direction.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.280
Penguins have abandoned flying

37:05.360 --> 37:08.800
and instead spend
most of their lives swimming.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.880
Their sleek survival suits
of tightly packed feathers

37:13.960 --> 37:16.560
are perfect for these freezing waters.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.440
Yet, they must still come ashore
once a year.

37:35.480 --> 37:40.320
South Georgia, an island wilderness
close to Antarctica.

37:42.880 --> 37:48.240
(PENGUINS SQUAWKING)

37:50.840 --> 37:54.680
Each spring, its beaches become
the busiest on Earth

37:54.760 --> 37:58.600
as hundreds of thousands
of king penguins return here.

38:02.760 --> 38:06.080
(SQUAWKING)

38:08.400 --> 38:10.200
They're heading for the colony.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.200
(GRUNTING)

38:17.240 --> 38:21.760
But in their way lies the biggest wall
of blubber on the planet.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.240
(ROARING)

38:26.040 --> 38:27.920
Elephant seals.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.640
It's the breeding season

38:37.800 --> 38:42.560
and the four-tonne bulls are fighting
for control of their harems.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.600
(TRUMPETS)

38:45.680 --> 38:48.240
Best to wait for them to calm down.

38:49.600 --> 38:53.520
(ROARING)

39:03.120 --> 39:05.440
He can't fly over this barrier,

39:05.520 --> 39:09.440
so he will have to walk
as unobtrusively as possible.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.280
And hope that sleeping giants
will continue to lie.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.600
(SNORES)

39:28.840 --> 39:29.880
Careful.

(PENGUINS SQUAWKING)

39:54.200 --> 39:56.200
(ROARING)

40:07.960 --> 40:10.520
A rival bull mounts a challenge.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.600

in the crossfire.

40:15.680 --> 40:20.960
(ROARING CONTINUES)

40:46.720 --> 40:49.320
Eight tonnes of blubber collide.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.480
(SCREECHES)

41:10.440 --> 41:14.000
The towering beach master is victorious.

41:21.040 --> 41:24.400
In the confusion,
this penguin slips through.

41:27.360 --> 41:30.760
Ahead are 40,000 chicks.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.720
Hungry and over-excited.

41:37.680 --> 41:40.680
(ALL CHIRPING)

41:52.320 --> 41:55.400
But not every penguin
has a chick to feed.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.720
That's not why they're here.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.640
There is another reason.

42:05.520 --> 42:09.960
There is a trial of endurance
that every penguin must face,

42:11.640 --> 42:15.080
and it starts with a persistent itch.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.840
His survival suit has been worn thin

42:24.920 --> 42:27.840
by months of swimming
in the rough southern ocean.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.280
His solution is drastic.

42:36.200 --> 42:39.960
Shed all four layers of feathers
as quickly as possible.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.640
The process is known
as a catastrophic moult.

42:54.760 --> 42:57.000
Until their feathers regrow,

42:57.120 --> 43:00.560
penguins will remain rooted to the spot.

43:06.960 --> 43:09.760
(ALL SQUAWKING)

43:23.280 --> 43:25.440
Having starved for a month,

43:25.600 --> 43:29.920
they're now fully waterproofed
and insulated once more.

43:45.160 --> 43:50.640
Lean, hungry and eager to return
to a life at sea.

43:57.120 --> 43:59.000
(SQUAWKING)

44:07.360 --> 44:09.680
Thanks to their waterproof plumage,

44:09.800 --> 44:12.840
penguins are able to make
the most of both worlds

44:12.960 --> 44:16.160
even in some of the harshest conditions
on Earth.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.200
The coasts of South Georgia

44:33.280 --> 44:36.080
are currently protected
by their remoteness.

44:38.640 --> 44:41.800
Other coastlines
are much more vulnerable,

44:46.560 --> 44:50.200
and they are now changing
faster than ever before.

44:54.760 --> 44:59.040
Two thirds of our major cities
are on our coasts.

45:01.800 --> 45:04.360
It's estimated that in the next decade,

45:04.440 --> 45:08.960
we can expect 10%
of the world's remaining wild shores

45:09.040 --> 45:12.000
to be taken over by human development.

45:21.240 --> 45:24.320
Yet every year,
just off Florida's Palm Beach

45:25.080 --> 45:29.040
and extraordinary spectacle appears
almost unnoticed.

45:35.360 --> 45:39.640
The biggest gathering of coastal sharks
on the planet.

45:44.720 --> 45:47.400
Spinners and blacktips.

45:52.480 --> 45:54.080
Ten thousand of them.

46:04.400 --> 46:08.120
Every January,
they seek out these warm shallows

46:08.560 --> 46:11.840
as a stopover
on their migration northwards.

46:18.280 --> 46:23.000
Sharks have been gathering here
since long before people arrived.

46:33.840 --> 46:37.040
But today, they face levels of pollution

46:37.560 --> 46:41.520
and habitat degradation
as well as fishing pressures.

46:41.640 --> 46:45.320
that their ancestors
would never have experienced.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.200
It's not longer enough
for coastal creatures

46:52.280 --> 46:54.600
to master their own worlds.

47:02.800 --> 47:08.520
Now they must face the many challenges
that come from our world, too.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.840
To film the most surprising
coastal wildlife,

47:33.960 --> 47:35.320
the Blue Planet II team

47:35.400 --> 47:38.320
travelled to some of the remotest shores
on the planet.

47:41.480 --> 47:44.520
One destination
was the Galapagos islands.

47:46.080 --> 47:49.480
Here they were in search
of an almost unbelievable story

47:49.560 --> 47:52.560
brought to them by a local cameraman
Richard Wollocombe.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.680
RICHARD: Well, I was talking
to a friend of mine

47:55.760 --> 47:56.840
who's a fisherman over here,

47:56.920 --> 48:00.760
and he said that one day
he turned up here in this bay,

48:00.840 --> 48:06.160
and suddenly he saw a group of sea lions
chasing these massive tuna

48:06.280 --> 48:08.040
up onto the beach.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.280
And I was like, "Yeah, funny one.
I don't believe a word of that."

48:11.400 --> 48:13.160
That just sounds too unreal.

48:13.560 --> 48:15.840
Still the lure of the fisherman's tale

48:15.920 --> 48:17.760
was too great to ignore.

48:18.200 --> 48:20.800
RICHARD: I'm a little nervous
that if it doesn't happen,

48:21.120 --> 48:22.360
there goes my credibility.

48:24.960 --> 48:28.840
The Blue Planet II team
launch a full-scale expedition,

48:31.240 --> 48:33.720
but one of them is still skeptical.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.880
It's gonna be pretty spectacular if...

48:37.120 --> 48:40.120
if a sea lion could actually chase down
and kill a tuna.

48:40.240 --> 48:41.920
I'm still yet to be convinced.

48:43.840 --> 48:46.680
They set up camp
in this barren cove,

48:47.280 --> 48:50.040
home for the next month.

48:51.600 --> 48:54.520
The local wildlife,
famed for its tameness,

48:54.600 --> 48:56.920
is curious to meet its new neighbours.

48:58.320 --> 49:01.400
(SHOOING)

49:08.160 --> 49:10.520
With no sign of the sea lions,

49:10.600 --> 49:14.960
the crew stake out the cove
with remote underwater cameras.

49:17.760 --> 49:21.040
Field assistant Roby Pepolas
takes first watch.

49:22.200 --> 49:23.600
ROBY: This is the point of view

49:23.840 --> 49:25.880
where we try to see
the sea lions come in

49:26.000 --> 49:27.680
jumping over the water.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.080
If they're definitely coming very close,

49:30.160 --> 49:33.800
they say, "Action, action,"
or "Rock and roll."

49:33.880 --> 49:35.280
(LAUGHS)

49:37.480 --> 49:39.160
Three hours later...

49:40.560 --> 49:44.240
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

49:45.880 --> 49:47.840
The aerial team are first up.

49:51.160 --> 49:54.000
It's a sea lion chasing tuna
into the bay.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.800
Oh, he's got it. He's got it.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.160
Unbelievable!

50:13.360 --> 50:15.240
Look at that, he's still struggling.

50:15.520 --> 50:16.960
Holy moly!

50:19.320 --> 50:20.360
He's lost him.

50:21.080 --> 50:23.520
The tuna gives the sea lion the slip.

50:29.160 --> 50:32.600
Over the coming days,
more sea lions arrive in the cove

50:32.680 --> 50:34.680
chasing in yellowfin tuna.

50:37.400 --> 50:39.480
RACHEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh!

50:40.000 --> 50:42.360
I bet you there's more tuna
and another sea lion.

50:42.880 --> 50:45.320
There's like six tuna in that bay.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.480
One sea lion
has caught Richard's attention,

50:57.560 --> 51:00.800
and he's affectionately
called him Tagboy.

51:01.800 --> 51:04.680
RICHARD: He's really different.
He's, like, a prolific hunter,

51:04.800 --> 51:06.600
and he's really agile.

51:07.280 --> 51:12.120
It's just fascinating to watch and see
the picture emerge about who he is.

51:13.640 --> 51:16.080
From above,
the drone is revealing

51:16.160 --> 51:18.680
how the group of sea lions
are hunting together.

51:19.080 --> 51:21.080
From the air, we really see
the strategy of the sea lion

51:21.160 --> 51:23.880
and see them
with their individual roles as well.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.720
Tagboy stays off
in the middle of the channel

51:25.800 --> 51:27.360
to make sure none of them escape.

51:27.440 --> 51:28.440
Everyone's got a role

51:28.520 --> 51:30.640
and they're really a team
in bringing them together.

51:31.640 --> 51:34.680
Although the sea lions
have been hunting in the shallows,

51:34.760 --> 51:38.440
the crew are yet to see them
drive a tuna onto the beach.

51:41.080 --> 51:45.400
And to make matters worse,
the sea lions aren't alone in this cove.

51:52.360 --> 51:55.360
Galapagos sharks, each two metres long.

51:59.040 --> 52:01.320
The shark almost beached itself

52:01.400 --> 52:04.320
and stole the tuna
from the big sea lion,

52:05.040 --> 52:08.040
who is now really angry.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.120
Despite the sharks,

52:11.240 --> 52:15.200
to reveal the full story,
Richard needs to get in the water.

52:16.120 --> 52:19.320
RICHARD: Classic shark attack scenario.
Blood in the water, shallow,

52:19.640 --> 52:21.520
and easy mistaken identity.

52:28.160 --> 52:29.720
RACHEL: Watch your hands, Roby.

52:30.360 --> 52:33.840
DAVID: The crew gain some protection
from chain mail suits.

52:43.600 --> 52:44.840
This is not a shark pool.

52:44.920 --> 52:47.720
One, two, three, four, five,
six sharks (CHUCKLES) now.

52:48.960 --> 52:53.640
With so much blood in the water,
the sharks go into a feeding frenzy.

53:07.800 --> 53:09.920
RICHARD: Make mince meat
of these tuna in seconds.

53:10.040 --> 53:14.480
To be so close to something
so unbelievably ferocious

53:14.880 --> 53:17.080
and dangerous, quite frankly,

53:17.320 --> 53:19.200
is amazing. It's... It's...

53:19.560 --> 53:21.880
It's nice to be able to hide
behind all this though.

53:23.960 --> 53:27.200
But then, after a week
of increasing activity,

53:27.280 --> 53:30.240
the sea lions suddenly stop fishing.

53:35.640 --> 53:36.920
ROBY: It's the first day though

53:37.000 --> 53:39.120
that we haven't seen any action
during the whole day.

53:39.560 --> 53:41.360
Since we start.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.800
We are kind of worried.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.400
The tuna have disappeared.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.680
Richard is worried.

54:01.160 --> 54:05.000
The signs are starting to show
across the globe

54:05.240 --> 54:07.920
that the seas are warming,
they're becoming less productive.

54:08.440 --> 54:12.560
Galapagos marine life
relies on cold, deep currents

54:12.680 --> 54:16.200
welling up intermittently
to fertilize the surface waters.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.000
(BARKING)

54:18.080 --> 54:20.560
If those upwellings
become less consistent,

54:20.720 --> 54:23.080
er, their lives could well be
in jeopardy.

54:24.680 --> 54:25.720
In the past,

54:25.800 --> 54:29.040
when these cold water upwellings
have temporarily stopped,

54:29.520 --> 54:31.800
many sea lions have starved to death.

54:32.960 --> 54:36.520
And a warming ocean
could further weaken these upwellings.

54:42.080 --> 54:45.080
Then after two weeks of nervous waiting,

54:45.200 --> 54:46.480
a hopeful sign.

54:46.560 --> 54:49.560
A thick fog descends over the cove.

54:50.320 --> 54:53.080
We've got very cold water
that's come up, upwelled,

54:53.360 --> 54:54.840
and spread across the ocean,

54:55.320 --> 54:57.440
and mixed with the warm air,
creating the fog

54:58.120 --> 54:59.960
and hoping that this cold water

55:00.480 --> 55:04.040
will just kick things off a bit,
you know, and get the action going.

55:04.920 --> 55:07.680
As the fog clears,
a welcome sight...

55:08.720 --> 55:12.440
The tuna are back
with sea lions hot on their heels.

55:15.720 --> 55:17.480
The crew leap into action.

55:20.760 --> 55:23.280
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

55:26.440 --> 55:27.560
Being in the water,

55:27.640 --> 55:31.000
Richard can at last follow
the sea lions' teamwork

55:35.640 --> 55:39.360
and finally film Tagboy beaching a tuna.

55:41.080 --> 55:43.840
RICHARD: The know the bottlenecks
in this labyrinth.

55:44.200 --> 55:46.360
They know how to push them
into those bottlenecks

55:46.480 --> 55:47.800
and threre was just Tagboy,

55:47.880 --> 55:50.520
almost his entire body
was blocking the entrance,

55:50.720 --> 55:53.960
and he was just gently back and forth
tiring the fish out.

55:54.560 --> 55:57.360
Absolutely extraordinary.
Really, really impressive.

55:58.160 --> 55:59.240
Director Rachel

55:59.320 --> 56:02.160
has a newfound respect
for the sea lions.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.800
RACHEL: I had no idea they were capable

56:04.880 --> 56:10.120
of this level of planning and strategy
and teamwork.

56:10.240 --> 56:12.720
I had no idea
they were this intelligent.

56:14.120 --> 56:18.520
Richard has succeeded in filming
this unique hunting strategy

56:18.600 --> 56:22.640
and in doing so has proved
the fisherman's tale to be true.

56:23.200 --> 56:27.080
RICHARD: The sea lions' intelligence
is unbelievably sophisticated.

56:27.640 --> 56:30.120
So to say that my expectations
have been exceeded

56:30.200 --> 56:31.600
is a sight understatement.

56:32.040 --> 56:33.760
This is been
one of the most remarkable times

56:33.840 --> 56:35.440
I've ever had here in the Galapagos.

56:46.200 --> 56:47.560
Next time...

56:48.000 --> 56:52.600
We travel the world to uncover
the biggest issues facing the ocean...

56:55.720 --> 56:57.480
meet the passionate people

56:57.560 --> 57:00.240
who've devoted their lives
to protecting it

57:01.640 --> 57:06.400
and discover what the future holds
for our blue planet.
