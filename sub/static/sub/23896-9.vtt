WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:09.300
Look at him, Tommy.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.760
Look at the way he buttons those buttons.

00:11.219 --> 00:12.762
Such dexterity. Such panache.

00:14.347 --> 00:15.682
He looked at me. He looked at me.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.600
Oh, be careful, Joey.
He might've just gotten you pregnant.

00:17.726 --> 00:18.810
He can do that, you know.

00:18.893 --> 00:21.813
Hey, this man just saved
the Commander from certain death.

00:21.896 --> 00:22.897
What are you known for?

00:23.148 --> 00:25.191
-Playing grab-ass, sir!
-Binge drinking, sir!

00:25.692 --> 00:28.319
That man's got a portfolio
you could only dream about.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.404
He's training cadets.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.072
He's capturing Zombie Killer Cain.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.824
He's saving the Commander's life.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.785
Oh, and in about 20 minutes,
he'll be tucking Chase Graves into bed.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.247
Does Chase like a kiss on the forehead?

00:39.330 --> 00:40.540
Does he have a favorite story, or...

00:40.707 --> 00:43.793
Damn straight, he has a favorite story.
It's <i>Goodnight Moon.</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:46.421
And he likes his kiss
on the mouth, lots of tongue.

00:46.629 --> 00:47.839
Mmm.

00:47.922 --> 00:51.176
And I mean this, you guys are all dicks.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.927
Ooh, you were hoping for some hoopla?

00:53.303 --> 00:54.637
Find the new Renegade for me.

00:55.263 --> 00:56.598
Then you'll get your <i>Star Wars</i> ending.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.476
You and Chewie and Han
collecting your medals.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.021
Holy hell, Lillywhite,

01:03.354 --> 01:05.023
you could get away
with murder around here.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.900
Already have. More than once.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.234
Times are good, my friend.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.570
Our product is selling like hotcakes.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.448
Our product?
I don't even know who I'm working for.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.575
You work for me. You get paid, don't you?

01:15.742 --> 01:16.743
Barely.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.954
In case you haven't noticed,
I am tremendously popular around here.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.456
I have the Commander's ear.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.708
When am I gonna move up
a tax bracket or two?

01:25.043 --> 01:27.170
-Uh-huh.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.506
Ravi, like, wrote the book on...

01:29.589 --> 01:31.132
Her mom's not gonna like it.

01:31.382 --> 01:32.550
No. She's not.

01:33.092 --> 01:35.678
"Hey, Mom.
I'm the only person in the world

01:35.762 --> 01:36.971
who can't turn into a zombie.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.057
I'm going to die here, in a strange city,

01:39.182 --> 01:40.934
surrounded by people you don't know,

01:41.309 --> 01:44.103
poking around my body,
and then poking around my corpse

01:44.187 --> 01:45.730
to see if they can make a vaccine."

01:45.897 --> 01:48.024
Isobel could be the key
to creating a vaccine

01:48.108 --> 01:50.485
that could prevent
every human on the planet

01:50.568 --> 01:52.237
from catching the zombie virus.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.072
As difficult as this is for her,

01:54.155 --> 01:55.824
it's the responsible thing to do.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.326
It's the adult thing to do.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.453
Ravi? My mom wants to speak to you.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.205
No, no. Not me.
Let Liv do it.

02:02.330 --> 02:05.500
I believe that taking that phone call
is the adult thing to do.

02:07.877 --> 02:08.920
Give it to me.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.551
Hi, Mrs. Bloom.

02:16.928 --> 02:17.929
Yes, ma'am.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.516
Yes, I will absolutely look after her.

02:22.725 --> 02:25.311
Yes. To the very best of my abilities.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.646
Thank you. Good night, ma'am.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.323
I can't help noticing that you have

02:37.407 --> 02:39.951
all six seasons of <i>Zombie High</i>
on a shelf in there.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.411
Yeah.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.912
Is it any good?

02:43.246 --> 02:44.247
Is it any good?

02:44.330 --> 02:46.791
It's only the best Zom-Com-Rom-Dram on TV.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.251
I went in thinking
I wasn't going to like it.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.168
He's a snob.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.170
But there's always
a great plot twist around the corner.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.297
I find the characters so winning.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.965
-So self-aware.
-Exactly.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.843
They react to absurd situations
almost exactly like we would.

02:56.968 --> 02:57.844
You up for binging it Pfft.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.054
Sign me up.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.098
Peyton's been basically living
at the mayor's office

03:02.181 --> 03:03.141
since the Baracus murder.

03:03.224 --> 03:04.559
I'm so in.

03:04.642 --> 03:07.645
Hot guys taking off their shirts
for seemingly no reason at all.

03:07.770 --> 03:08.646
How could that be bad?

03:08.771 --> 03:11.107
-I'm sorry, I love Shane LeBeau.
-Oh...

03:11.190 --> 03:12.650
The way he gobbles scenery.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.694
I know he's supposed to be the Big Bad,

03:14.777 --> 03:16.738
but I end up rooting for him,

03:16.821 --> 03:18.865
even though he's doing truly vile things.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.455
A cure

03:26.080 --> 03:27.832
I can't imagine such a thing.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.252
Spare me. We know you've seen
the Baracus video.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.545
Which video?

03:32.712 --> 03:34.923
The one where he's shot dead,
through the heart,

03:35.048 --> 03:37.550
which is how humans die,
not how zombies die.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.552
I'm surprised I missed that one.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.679
The mayor's dead, you say?

03:42.138 --> 03:43.306
You really buried the lead.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.059
How is there a meeting in my office

03:46.142 --> 03:47.769
that didn't make it onto my calendar app?

03:47.852 --> 03:50.271
Yeah, speaking of calendars,
the mayor's indicated

03:50.355 --> 03:52.315
that he'd be at The Scratching Post
the night he was murdered.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.901
Plus, after eating the mayor's brain,

03:54.984 --> 03:57.695
I've had so many disgusting visions
of the back of this place,

03:57.779 --> 03:59.322
I'm considering a lobotomy.

03:59.572 --> 04:00.782
Eye of the beholder, lady.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.992
What was the mayor doing here
the night he was murdered?

04:03.284 --> 04:05.036
-Eating. Drinking.
-Being merry.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.791
I'm human again!
I'm human again!

04:12.877 --> 04:14.879
She's back.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.509
Either of you into weird sex party masks?

04:19.801 --> 04:21.010
I'm surprised I don't have mine on.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.554
Which one of you owns
a 9mm with a suppressor?

04:23.930 --> 04:24.889
Not I, said the fly.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.766
Not me, said the flea.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.018
You boys are heading for a fall.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.646
I hope I'm the one
that gets to do the pushing.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.949
Starting a family at 21

04:43.157 --> 04:44.784
wasn't exactly how I drew it up,

04:44.867 --> 04:46.828
but Leah said she was pregnant,

04:47.036 --> 04:48.913
and suddenly "how I drew it up"
didn't matter anymore.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.540
You gonna make an honest woman of her?

04:50.790 --> 04:51.791
A week from today. Just a courthouse thing,

04:53.376 --> 04:55.295
but we're heading to
Mickey's Hi-Hat afterwards.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.505
I mean, anyone who isn't offended

04:57.588 --> 04:59.632
by a cash bar reception is welcome.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.342
We're so happy for you, Curtis.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.095
And I think we may have
a secret slush fund

05:04.178 --> 05:06.431
for broke-ass coyotes' wedding receptions.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.433
Yeah, we do.
Yes, we do.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.226
You have any names picked out yet?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.936
Uh, nothing weird, okay?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.732
No "Walnut," or "Cricket," or "Cue Ball."

05:15.898 --> 05:18.443
How 'bout something cool, like, "Levon"?

05:18.526 --> 05:20.320
"Levon"?
-You know, after the kid's father.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.030
Oh, gross.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.823
I mean, what're you

05:23.948 --> 05:26.326
-Fi... Ouch.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.370
Speaking of adding to the family,
are we looking to grow?

05:29.454 --> 05:30.913
Always, why do you ask?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.166
-I know a guy.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.418
If I didn't trust him,
I wouldn't tell you about him.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.379
Bring him in.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.259
All right. Meet our next clients.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.475
-Cool.
-Yeah.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.535
<i>Don't you die!</i>

06:51.536 --> 06:53.621
<i>I'm scared.</i>
<i>Don't you die on me!</i>

07:20.231 --> 07:22.525
<i>The zombie didn't scratch me.</i>
<i> Put the gun away.</i>

07:26.487 --> 07:28.030
I'm right on top of this guy, Lieutenant.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.490
He's sweating. I can feel it.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.200
Give me a few more days.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.080
Yeah, well, take my badge,
you desk-hugging kiss-ass.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.082
Yeah?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.042
Well, those are the rules I play by.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.550
Father, you in?

07:50.136 --> 07:51.596
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.556
It's been one week
since my last confession.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.808
And I gotta be straight with you,

07:55.892 --> 07:58.936
I haven't demonstrated
much personal growth since last we spoke.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.772
You know that weird
sex stuff we talked about?

08:01.856 --> 08:04.609
Yeah, I'm having a tough time
giving that up.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.360
Not sure that it's in me.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.987
And I, um...

08:08.070 --> 08:09.489
Oh, this one's not great.

08:11.199 --> 08:15.161
I superglued this guy's, um...
buttocks to a toilet seat.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.663
To be fair, the guy's a turd.
A real turd, Father.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.875
Uh... Lots of Lord's names in vains,

08:21.042 --> 08:23.753
and you know me
and impure thoughts. And...

08:25.254 --> 08:26.631
I might as well confess to this,

08:26.714 --> 08:27.924
get it out of the way.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.800
I'm working on this score. I could retire on this, Father.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.180
What do they say in <i>Hamilton?</i>
I'm not throwin' away my--

08:42.355 --> 08:44.273
Gut shot. Three times.

08:44.649 --> 08:48.486
Detective Benedetto
didn't just die, he died hard.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.487
Hmm.

08:50.488 --> 08:54.242
My expert medical opinion
is that he died hard, too.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.326
Hmm.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.620
And such beautiful weather today,
would you say--

08:57.787 --> 09:00.373
Yes. It was a good day to die hard.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.499
You two done?

09:04.168 --> 09:07.880
Benedetto was tracking
a dangerous felon named Albert Ghansu.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.884
Ghansu used to be partners
with our old friend, Anthony Jin.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.053
-The very one.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.638
The one you beat the hell out of.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.431
When you were on kung fu brain.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.558
The Boot Party murder.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.142
And then we let the guy out

09:20.226 --> 09:22.812
because he provided information
about James Weckler's murder.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.357
Turns out A.J. and another
Cobra member, Bi Li Xiong,

09:26.440 --> 09:29.026
AKA "Fleabag," helped Ghansu with a heist

09:29.110 --> 09:30.861
that netted a quarter-mil in jewels.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.238
Fleabag?

09:32.321 --> 09:33.573
Do you think there was
an isolated incident

09:33.656 --> 09:35.241
where the man had fleas,
or does he always have them

09:35.324 --> 09:36.200
and everyone's just accepted it?

09:36.367 --> 09:38.744
I assumed that he had a taste
for cheap motels.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.957
Benedetto put Ghansu away
for the heist three years ago.

09:43.207 --> 09:46.586
Ghansu reportedly
stashed the loot before getting locked up.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.546
Last week, Ghansu escaped from county.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.673
Now all three of these
guys are on the street,

09:50.756 --> 09:53.467
and I'm willing to bet
one of these guys killed Benedetto.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.886
Guess it's time I fix myself
a little snack.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.222
You gotta ask yourself one question.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.683
Do I feel hungry

10:02.476 --> 10:05.438
I'll come back down
and check in with you in...

10:06.480 --> 10:07.607
48 hours.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.112
Come on.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.199
That's too soon.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.077
How about another 48 hours?

10:20.244 --> 10:21.078
There it is.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.293
Mmm.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.087
I didn't feel like cooking.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.214
Unforeseen tidings

10:32.381 --> 10:35.551
in regards to the Baracus assassination.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.846
My search for the auspices
of the Bitcoin auction

10:38.929 --> 10:42.767
for the zombie cures is at an impasse.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.811
You seemed pretty confident you were gonna
be able to figure out who was behind it.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.521
Borderline braggy.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.399
Whoever set up this auction

10:50.483 --> 10:54.153
is the Cezanne of the Digital Age.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.030
He is a virtuoso.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.783
A genius with no peers.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.708
Are you dumb for doing this?
Or am I dumb for watching?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.168
I stretched my shirt. Whatever.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.004
With the money we're raking in,

11:12.088 --> 11:13.839
shirts mean nothing to me now.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.091
We could buy Shirt Island!

11:15.257 --> 11:16.842
We could pay scientists

11:17.009 --> 11:20.513
to genetically engineer
a shirt-tree for us.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.598
-Thanks, Chef.
You're welcome, sir.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.655
God's mercy provided
and the people were fed.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.074
Look at this place.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.994
On the lips of every zombie in Seattle,

11:44.161 --> 11:46.455
you've become
quite the successful businessman.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.458
If your mother were alive today...

11:49.542 --> 11:52.002
-Maybe we shouldn't.
-She would have loved this.

11:53.587 --> 11:56.132
The two of us sharing meals, conversing.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.886
When will you finally accept
my invitation to join us at the church?

12:01.595 --> 12:02.596
Soon.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.267
I don't know if you've been
keeping up with the news.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.061
News beyond the wall
doesn't hold much interest for me anymore.

12:09.728 --> 12:10.729
It should.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.107
Do you want your flock to survive?

12:13.190 --> 12:15.067
I want zombies to survive.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.194
I want our faith to survive.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.822
I would love to be there to see

12:19.905 --> 12:22.241
all of my prophecies come true,

12:22.324 --> 12:23.993
but I fear that's not my fate.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.914
I am merely the Baptist John.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.292
Is that so?

12:33.502 --> 12:37.465
And where should
we be looking for Zombie Jesus?

12:45.097 --> 12:46.515
You shouldn't laugh, son.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.769
I hear your voice,

12:51.020 --> 12:53.856
and I hear echoes of the voice of God.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.779
Which window?

13:01.947 --> 13:02.948
Second story.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.535
You really think Fleabag killed Benedetto?

13:06.702 --> 13:09.830
Not really.
Fleabag is a safe cracker, a burglar.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.832
No violence of any kind on his record.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.918
But I figure he knows where Ghansu is.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.170
Why're you chewing that nicotine gum?

13:16.253 --> 13:18.130
-I'm trying to quit.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.884
I don't know what to do with my hands.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.139
You and Michelle knockin' boots yet?

13:29.475 --> 13:31.060
I'm not doing this dance with you, Liv.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.228
Hand stuff?

13:33.979 --> 13:35.731
Look, we kissed.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.025
The night of the lock-down.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.402
-I knew it!
It's complicated.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.948
Look, I love Dale, but...

13:44.823 --> 13:46.033
I've also been thinking about

13:46.116 --> 13:49.453
how every future I've imagined for myself

13:50.454 --> 13:51.830
had kids in it.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.750
I wanna be a dad, Liv.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.462
With a human like Michelle,
that can happen.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.881
They're not letting zombies adopt,

14:00.965 --> 14:03.509
so, you know, with Dale,

14:04.843 --> 14:08.347
that means no kids, ever.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.643
Eh, kids suck. You don't want them
in this line of work.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.770
Oh, I love this song.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.648
<i>Radio 80,</i>
<i>all '80s, all the time.</i>

14:19.817 --> 14:21.151
Hold down the fort.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.528
I wanna grill up a salmon tonight.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.238
I'm gonna check out their selection.

14:27.241 --> 14:30.661
Don't bring a fish back in this car, Liv!

14:32.162 --> 14:33.247
Who's this?

15:02.526 --> 15:03.360
Hey!

15:04.486 --> 15:05.321
Dang!

15:08.616 --> 15:09.450
Liv! Stop!

15:11.076 --> 15:11.952
<i>Where's Ghansu?</i>

15:12.036 --> 15:13.495
<i>Aah! I don't know</i>
<i>what you're talking about!</i>

15:13.579 --> 15:15.122
<i>Don't lie to me,</i>
<i>you little sewer rat!</i>

15:15.205 --> 15:17.374
<i>Okay! Okay!</i>
<i>He's with Rosalie! Rosalie! </i>

15:17.458 --> 15:19.710
I just got off the phone
with the Chief of Police.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.253
Did he love it?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.339
No! "Benedetto brain" or not,

15:23.422 --> 15:24.673
what's on that tape is unacceptable.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.383
Dale, it won't happen again.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.636
No, it won't. Liv's suspended.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.179
<i>Que? </i>

15:30.262 --> 15:31.722
You're not to leave this building

15:31.805 --> 15:34.099
or participate in field work of any kind

15:34.183 --> 15:36.268
-for the foreseeable future.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.395
I'm going to need
your suspension paperwork

15:38.479 --> 15:40.105
completed by the end of the day.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.983
I've also included
the SPD rules of conduct,

15:43.067 --> 15:45.527
as the Chief thought
you might need a refresher.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.582
You're gonna find that this city
needs me more than I need it.

15:59.917 --> 16:05.756
Yow! Oh...
I'm sorry. Stubbed my toe.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.511
-I'll get those.
-Uh-huh.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.353
<i>No, Parker! Don't do it!</i>

16:19.436 --> 16:20.813
Yeah, Parker. It's a dumb idea.

16:20.896 --> 16:23.440
<i> Somebody has to.</i>
<i>It might as well be me.</i>

16:25.234 --> 16:27.027
No!

16:28.946 --> 16:30.030
Good one.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.866
Okay, Liv.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.287
Kill, eat, marry. Parker, Ben, Henry.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.414
Ooh, good one.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.792
Marry Ben. Eat Henry
for the pilot's license,

16:41.875 --> 16:43.877
incredibly useful
after a zombie apocalypse.

16:43.961 --> 16:44.962
-Of course.
-Naturally.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.296
I'd eat James.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.632
'Cause then you'd have
all those memories of sex with Jenna.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.551
-I hadn't considered that.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.052
And kill Parker, I guess.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.346
No! Parker's way too hot to kill.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.932
They're all too hot.
It's like the Kobayashi Maru.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.060
-In <i>Star Trek,</i> when--
-Blech.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.063
Marry Parker. Eat Ben

17:03.147 --> 17:06.608
for the ability to fix
small electronic devices alone.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.027
Kill Henry.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.612
But mostly, marry Parker.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.282
You know, I met Parker,

17:13.365 --> 17:14.700
when I was working
on that <i>Zombie High</i> case.

17:15.492 --> 17:16.910
Tell me everything.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.121
He burned with the intensity
of 1,000 suns.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.206
Oh, that is so Parker.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.417
-Come on, let's go to bed. You don't have to fake yawn.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.923
You can just choose
to go back to the bedroom.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.383
No judgment.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.885
Well, then...

17:34.219 --> 17:36.388
-To bed!
-Okay.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.642
-Sure.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.937
Uh-oh.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.856
Tonal shift. What's wrong?

17:46.315 --> 17:49.276
-I'm gonna die.
-I've heard.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.612
I just thought there might be more to it.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.197
Yeah, well...

17:54.323 --> 17:56.867
I'm just thinking of all the stuff
I'm gonna miss out on.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.744
You know, going to college. Winning a Nobel Prize.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.748
Falling in love. Having sex.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.667
Let me stop you right there.
Sex? Totally overrated.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.837
Is that why you wait up
until 2:00 a.m. for Peyton to come home?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.964
Because sex is "totally overrated"?

18:11.048 --> 18:13.675
I wait up for the companionship.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.887
Sex itself? It's a bit of a chore,
if you must know.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.936
A chore. Got it.

18:24.478 --> 18:27.481
Oh, no.
It's the crap episode of <i>Zombie High</i>

18:27.564 --> 18:29.191
where it's clear
the show ran out of money,

18:29.274 --> 18:30.651
so everything cool happens off-screen,

18:30.734 --> 18:32.694
and the characters
just talk about it afterwards.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.446
You should've seen it, Liv!

18:34.738 --> 18:36.573
-I show up at Rosalie's...

18:36.740 --> 18:40.077
and guess who opens the door a crack
when I knock?

18:41.703 --> 18:44.331
Anthony Jin! And he books it!

18:44.498 --> 18:48.502
I kick down the door and chase him
up the fire escape to the roof.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.421
A.J.'s running towards
the edge of the roof,

18:51.505 --> 18:54.883
and I see someone
has laid down these planks over the alley,

18:54.967 --> 18:57.886
kind of a makeshift bridge
to the next building.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.054
Know what I do?

18:59.263 --> 19:01.640
-You shoot the planks.
-Damn straight I do.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.517
I shoot the first one... Bang!

19:03.976 --> 19:07.855
But A.J. decides he's gonna try his luck
with the remaining plank,

19:07.938 --> 19:10.274
and he takes his first step.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.193
Guess what I say?

19:13.360 --> 19:16.572
"One more step,
and it'll be planks for the memories?"

19:18.031 --> 19:19.700
Really? You think
I'd say something like that?

19:19.867 --> 19:20.909
I would.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.246
I said, "Stop!

19:25.205 --> 19:26.707
I don't want to kill you,

19:27.916 --> 19:29.168
and you don't wanna die!"

19:32.045 --> 19:33.046
That's not bad, huh?

19:33.213 --> 19:34.965
"Derivative," but whatever.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.968
You got our old friend A.J. in there?

19:38.260 --> 19:39.678
Let's do this.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.222
The lieutenant said
you couldn't leave the building.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.350
Interrogations might
be a gray area, so be cool in there.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.061
-Cool is my middle--
-Stop.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.858
-You, again.
-Shut up, scumbag.

19:52.941 --> 19:53.942
What's with the gum?

19:54.526 --> 19:57.863
It's a signal. I'm bad cop.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.531
Let me handle this.

20:01.408 --> 20:04.369
Not sure if you heard
that Detective Benedetto is dead.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.915
Then there is a god.
Liv.

20:11.126 --> 20:14.922
Your old running buddy Albert Ghansu
busted out of the county jail.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.257
He has your jewels, doesn't he?

20:17.382 --> 20:18.926
What jewels are you referring to?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.679
So, explain why you were
at his girlfriend's place?

20:22.846 --> 20:26.141
I heard there was a reward
for information leading to his arrest.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.643
I wanted to get in on that.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.311
I've changed, Officers.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.271
What does my P.O. say?

20:32.481 --> 20:35.192
-He says you've been a model ex-con.
-That's right.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.612
The dirtiest person involved
in all of this was Benedetto.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.949
He didn't want to
arrest anybody. He wanted the loot.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.242
The loot you don't know about.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.826
Checkmate, butt-wad.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.330
You see, when a parole officer
starts talking

20:48.413 --> 20:50.499
about a skell changing his ways,

20:50.582 --> 20:53.669
all that says to me
is that he's on to an even bigger score.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.629
I didn't kill Benedetto!

20:56.713 --> 20:57.965
Why'd you run then?

20:59.341 --> 21:00.926
It's a hard habit to break.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.970
We're not finished. Sit down.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.939
Superglue

21:18.402 --> 21:20.279
Tell us about Benedetto

21:20.362 --> 21:22.531
making you sit on a toilet seat
covered in superglue.

21:23.949 --> 21:24.783
What?

21:24.908 --> 21:26.952
He figured I'd heard from Ghansu,

21:27.035 --> 21:28.036
but I hadn't.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.999
You want my alibi for Benedetto's murder,
check with County Hospital.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.667
They'll have a record of me there.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.837
Trying to get a toilet seat off my ass.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.549
If that's true,
I'll bet they remember it.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.217
Stay put.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.982
So, how about you stop playin' footsie

21:57.065 --> 21:59.109
and tell me where I can find Ghansu.

22:02.946 --> 22:03.864
What are you doing?

22:05.824 --> 22:07.743
Well, look here.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.203
Seems like I'm not a cop anymore.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.165
We're just two guys having a conversation.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.669
Start talkin' or things could get ugly.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.255
You're a zombie. I get it.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.632
You were a zombie when we tussled.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.176
That's how you knew kung fu.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.887
And that's the only reason you beat me.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.181
I might not know kung fu anymore,

22:30.015 --> 22:31.141
but I know Brooklyn.

22:31.808 --> 22:35.312
Tick-tock, A.J. Tick-tock.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.776
Oh, no. Thank you.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.615
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.200
Clive, let me mess him up.

22:48.283 --> 22:49.826
We'll say he fell down the stairs.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.787
-His alibi checks out.
-Ugh.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.289
He was at the hospital
when Benedetto was murdered.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.709
And where the hell did you get a gun?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.961
My dad died in jail last year.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.838
-Who gives a flying--
-Liv.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.340
That ain't gonna be me.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.761
It doesn't need to be, A.J.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.012
I wanna be good.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.810
Hey, Clive. You're not buying
all this, are you?

23:15.102 --> 23:17.687
Ghansu'll be at Emerald Downs
racetrack this Friday.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.565
-He can't stay away from the ponies.

23:22.567 --> 23:26.404
Hey. Ravi Shakes. How's it hangin'?

23:26.488 --> 23:28.573
<i>Not so well, actually.</i>

23:28.657 --> 23:30.826
Isobel just sent me a photo
of herself and Davis Crawford,

23:30.951 --> 23:32.119
<i>who you might know better as </i>Zombie High's

23:32.285 --> 23:34.246
zombie-slayin' heartbreaker, Parker Cole.

23:34.412 --> 23:36.039
That worked out? Good.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.124
What do you mean, "That worked out?"

23:37.207 --> 23:39.042
You heard how much she liked him, right?

23:39.126 --> 23:40.669
I made a few phone calls.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.713
Tell them a dying girl
wants to hang with her TV crush,

23:43.797 --> 23:46.091
and bada-bing, bada-bang,
he's taking her out tonight.

23:46.174 --> 23:50.095
Liv. Isobel told me she was sad
she was never going to have sex.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.138
Wouldn't you be?

23:53.431 --> 23:54.516
You don't think she might--

23:54.599 --> 23:57.144
Isobel's mother told me she trusted me

23:57.310 --> 23:58.728
<i>to look out for her.</i>

23:58.937 --> 24:01.189
Do me a favor and text me
as soon as they get home.

24:01.356 --> 24:03.900
No can do. I'm staying at Levon's tonight.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.735
Hello?

24:05.902 --> 24:08.405
I carry no ill will toward humans.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.031
My heart aches for them.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.909
How sad to wake up
each morning afraid to die,

24:14.494 --> 24:16.663
when death is a glorious gift.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.415
Glorious gift.

24:18.498 --> 24:20.333
Zombies are the liberated ones.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.712
In our great hall, gluttony is no sin.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.338
We shall eat eagerly,

24:25.422 --> 24:27.799
and we shall eat
as much as we damn well please!

24:27.883 --> 24:29.551
-Amen.
Amen!

24:32.262 --> 24:34.764
Today is a special day for me, my friends.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.101
Today we're joined by my son.

24:39.644 --> 24:43.023
Hey, that's you. You're a star.

24:43.398 --> 24:45.317
Blaine, stand up. Be recognized.

24:52.824 --> 24:56.077
My son has grown up to be a huge success,

24:56.161 --> 24:58.371
despite my being
an absentee father at best.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.081
More aptly, an ogre.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.210
But I want to make that up to him.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.046
Elder Jones?

25:06.213 --> 25:07.964
-Better be a pro sports franchise,

25:08.048 --> 25:10.217
if he plans on making up
for all those lost years.

25:12.719 --> 25:14.012
No such luck.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.518
Please give <i>Frau</i> Bader
a warm welcome.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.856
Isn't that the hag that made you
clean the floor with your tongue?

25:27.609 --> 25:29.861
<i>Frau</i> Bader has served loyally in my household
for the past three decades.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.449
She was always a God-fearing woman

25:34.532 --> 25:36.826
who feared for my immortal soul.

25:39.162 --> 25:41.164
Get a load of me now. Can you believe it?

25:41.665 --> 25:43.416
I'm so happy for you.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.670
But <i>Frau</i> Bader was a sinner.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.590
She abused my only son.

25:52.550 --> 25:55.262
I trusted you. I paid you generously.

25:55.762 --> 25:58.390
I turned a blind eye, even though
I knew you were hurting my son.

25:58.556 --> 26:02.769
My son who feeds our fellow zombies
out of kindness and decency.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.813
The boy needed to be disciplined.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.731
-He was a child!
-He was a monster!

26:08.817 --> 26:11.444
And what is so wrong with monsters?

26:31.673 --> 26:33.967
Our hearts ache for the living.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.095
But alas, so do our bellies.

26:42.684 --> 26:45.812
God loves you. He means it.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.648
Chow!

27:03.496 --> 27:05.206
Probably not even his cat.

27:08.668 --> 27:10.170
Probably not even his mom.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.316
All right, then.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.405
Why don't we wrap this up here?

27:37.489 --> 27:40.116
You're 12 minutes past New Seattle curfew.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.744
Seriously, dude...
You standing there, it's, uh...

27:43.203 --> 27:44.204
It's weird.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.333
I should go inside now.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.418
You shan't be seeing her again.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.545
You mean, because I'm dying?

27:52.754 --> 27:56.174
No. What? I... That's not what I...

28:01.471 --> 28:02.597
Good night.

28:03.264 --> 28:06.017
And he'll get over it. So, call me.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.769
I'm not dead yet.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.105
Isobel.

28:11.314 --> 28:14.401
You are the coolest person--

28:15.652 --> 28:17.654
You had me worried sick!

28:17.737 --> 28:19.030
I've been scrolling
through that boy's Instagram

28:19.114 --> 28:20.198
and I don't like what I've seen.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.075
He's an actor, Isobel.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.327
His pathological need for validation,

28:24.411 --> 28:25.829
for recognition, for fame...

28:25.995 --> 28:28.790
It makes genuine
human interaction nearly impossible.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.546
Thank you for caring, Ravi.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.089
Of course.

28:36.798 --> 28:40.677
-Perfection.

28:40.760 --> 28:44.305
-Aw, well, that's nice to--
-And I checked off

28:44.389 --> 28:46.975
a lot of stuff from my bucket list.

28:47.475 --> 28:49.519
-You know.

28:49.602 --> 28:50.729
You're joking.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.440
Ravi. Of course, I am.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.320
-I am.
-Good.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.197
Or am I?

29:11.666 --> 29:14.461
There is always some sort of foul odor

29:14.544 --> 29:16.504
in these human neighborhoods.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.590
Don't you think?

29:19.716 --> 29:20.675
Not really.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.271
You know who I am?

29:36.024 --> 29:38.443
Ah, I was patient, don't you think?

29:39.402 --> 29:41.362
I didn't make human smuggling
a capital crime

29:41.446 --> 29:43.990
until months of warnings
did nothing to stem the tide.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.327
Then I set up a guillotine
in the middle of the city,

29:47.410 --> 29:50.663
and I warned human smugglers that this
was their fate if they broke the law.

29:51.372 --> 29:52.749
Did that stop them?

29:53.249 --> 29:56.961
Did they take me seriously? Nope.

29:57.796 --> 30:01.174
And then I followed through
and I executed Renegade One.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.636
Oh, has that slowed human importation?

30:05.053 --> 30:08.431
For a while. But here we are,
back at an all-time high.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.227
Now, I know you're not Renegade.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.395
You're human.
You're not scratching anyone.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.983
Look, please... Just scratch me.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.569
Maybe.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.532
You'll need to help us out a bit, first.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.325
You have a choice here, you know.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.577
You can tell me who this new Renegade is,

30:30.286 --> 30:32.205
or I will shoot you through your heart,

30:32.997 --> 30:34.541
then my friend and I will eat your brain

30:34.624 --> 30:37.210
and wait for a vision
to show us what we want to know.

30:40.922 --> 30:42.674
Why don't you just tell us
who you're working for?

30:46.678 --> 30:48.721
All I wanted was to be a zombie.

30:49.931 --> 30:53.852
Brother Love promised
that if I brought ten humans into Seattle,

30:53.935 --> 30:55.270
he would scratch me.

30:56.396 --> 31:00.066
Now, please. I need to be saved.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.236
Why would Brother Love
want to bring humans into Seattle?

31:03.778 --> 31:07.866
Because when zombies
begin to starve, they'll see a light.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.910
They'll see that
humans are food put on this Earth

31:10.994 --> 31:12.287
for zombies to consume.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.375
I need to pee.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.723
Brother Love? That's a new one.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.225
-Well...

31:35.018 --> 31:38.354
They say his followers are fanatics.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.648
I don't know anything
about what he preaches.

31:41.024 --> 31:43.026
This is the church
Lillywhite told me about.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.819
Why don't you check it out?
See what you think.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.655
I think he's lying, anyway.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.532
He gave us this name too easily.

31:51.492 --> 31:52.493
Save your appetite,

31:52.577 --> 31:54.871
I suspect we'll be having
coyote brain for dinner.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.552
There doesn't seem to be any pattern here.

32:10.094 --> 32:13.014
Isobel's body rejected
all the expected pathogens.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.516
These could be the results for any kid.

32:15.850 --> 32:18.311
I was hoping I'd find
irregularities, but, no.

32:18.394 --> 32:19.729
A month wasted.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.272
You had to start here.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.107
Who knows how much time we'll have.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.152
She's donating her body.
So, we'll have time after--

32:26.235 --> 32:29.489
How old is this actor, Davis?

32:30.448 --> 32:33.076
He's two years older than Isobel. He's 18.

32:33.242 --> 32:36.371
Sure. That's what it says
in his press clippings,

32:36.454 --> 32:40.124
but actors lie, about everything,
especially age.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.670
I told you I saw them kissing.
Hands, tongues.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.213
Bodies pressed together.
The whole shebang.

32:47.882 --> 32:48.841
Good. You're here.

32:49.550 --> 32:50.593
Is something wrong?

32:51.636 --> 32:53.554
Fillmore-Graves captured Curtis.

32:54.555 --> 32:55.723
You know where he's being held?

32:55.890 --> 32:56.933
No idea.

33:01.854 --> 33:03.731
Just before I came in,

33:04.232 --> 33:05.608
I heard Major on the phone,

33:05.692 --> 33:08.695
talking about emergency
guard duty tonight.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.448
Is your hide-a-key
still in the same place?

33:12.615 --> 33:14.117
Liv. Are you sure we should--

33:14.200 --> 33:17.328
You don't think we should be doing
everything we can to save Curtis?

33:20.415 --> 33:21.624
Same place. Yeah.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.085
Come on. I'm parked by the loading dock.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.294
Be careful.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.255
Can you please make sure
the word gets out?

33:27.839 --> 33:29.716
The entry point must be compromised.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.009
Will do.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.102
Hey there, Little Fox. It's Jolly Green.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.855
Donnie Darko is off the board.

33:43.938 --> 33:45.690
No more low road to China.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.193
-Ravi!
-Gotta go.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.320
You'll never guess what happened.

33:51.487 --> 33:53.281
Oh, what happened to you?

33:53.448 --> 33:55.033
-Just left.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.826
Damn. She would've loved to hear this.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.703
You were telling me about why you're wet.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.290
I caught up with Ghansu
in his hotel suite.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.543
I wait until he orders up a burger.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.545
Then I cruise in,

34:08.796 --> 34:10.673
riding a room service trolley.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.550
He pulls a gun,

34:12.633 --> 34:15.970
and we both go shooting over his balcony,

34:16.137 --> 34:19.223
ass over teakettle into a pool...

34:20.683 --> 34:22.060
Three stories down.

34:25.104 --> 34:26.314
Who's Ghansu?

34:29.942 --> 34:32.612
Oh, Clive. I'm kidding.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.615
Did his gun match the one
from the Benedetto murder?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.200
Yes.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.826
That's an amazing story, Clive.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.620
Don't patronize me.

35:03.017 --> 35:04.268
Shh, shh, shh.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.733
Humans, humans everywhere,

35:10.817 --> 35:12.902
and not a brain to eat?

35:12.985 --> 35:14.987
Does that seem fair to you?

35:15.196 --> 35:16.739
No!

35:16.823 --> 35:19.283
Do they understand the sacrifice

35:19.367 --> 35:22.578
we make every single day? They spurn us.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.123
They expel their zombie children

35:25.206 --> 35:27.041
and their zombie elderly
out of their homes

35:27.125 --> 35:29.335
because we disgust them, and, yet...

35:31.629 --> 35:35.800
Do they thank us
for that sacrifice we make?

35:35.883 --> 35:38.010
Each time one of them
passes on the sidewalk, and we don't bash their skulls in,

35:40.304 --> 35:43.933
and rip into that which sates
our primal hunger?

35:44.016 --> 35:46.018
No!
-No.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.813
The well is hell.

35:49.188 --> 35:51.149
Hell is the well!

36:12.253 --> 36:15.631
Four zombies in there. And Curtis.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.342
They got him in that room there.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.888
Maybe if I go full-on zombie,
I can bend those bars.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.556
If it's a Fillmore-Graves' safe house,

36:23.681 --> 36:25.016
don't you think
they would've thought of that?

36:25.391 --> 36:26.893
Besides, they're gonna
hear you break the window.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.477
Not if you do what I ask.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.289
-Hit me.
While they're distracted. Hurry!

36:50.541 --> 36:51.834
For the record, I don't like this.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.297
My nonna hits harder than that.

37:02.094 --> 37:03.638
-Aah!
-Whoa.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.806
Are you as turned on right now as I am?

37:21.906 --> 37:23.449
It's not working, Liv.

37:26.118 --> 37:28.788
Come on, Liv. You know what we need to do.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.582
You can't let them eat my brain.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.167
You're getting married and having a baby.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.962
I knew the risks. She knew the risks.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.888
Oh. I told them Brother Love was Renegade.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.390
Maybe bought us a little time.

37:47.890 --> 37:50.351
Smart. You're a smart kid.

37:51.644 --> 37:52.687
Check the coyote!

37:53.104 --> 37:53.980
Go!

38:02.405 --> 38:03.489
Commander.

38:05.866 --> 38:06.909
Yes?

38:07.243 --> 38:08.744
I'm afraid I have bad news.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.579
What is it?

38:10.788 --> 38:12.915
Our prisoner was turned
into a zombie last night.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.305
How is that possible?

38:27.805 --> 38:29.098
Someone knew where he was.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.267
They broke a window to his room
and scratched him.

38:31.350 --> 38:34.478
And the sound of a breaking window
failed to alert any of you?

38:34.562 --> 38:36.981
We assume whoever did it
set off one of our car alarms.

38:37.064 --> 38:37.940
My car alarm.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.276
And used the cover of the alarm
to get the job done.

38:40.359 --> 38:42.528
Everyone get out their cell phones
right now and unlock them.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.157
I want to know if any of you
might've sent a signal. Unlock that.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.218
Who loves you, baby?

39:11.891 --> 39:13.559
This way.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.364
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

39:28.407 --> 39:30.076
Crazy couple of days.

39:30.743 --> 39:31.744
Tell me about it.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.086
You put a tracker in my pocket?

39:40.252 --> 39:41.545
You could have gotten me killed! Did you even consider that?

39:43.089 --> 39:44.924
You're too close
to Fillmore-Graves, Major.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.218
You're a true believer.
You wouldn't understand.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.053
How the hell are you
even involved with a coyote?

39:49.220 --> 39:52.807
A coyote who works for the biggest
human smuggler in the city, no less.

39:52.890 --> 39:55.309
Look, I know that you smuggled
a kid out of the city,

39:55.476 --> 39:56.769
-but I had--
-Hey, buddy.

39:56.852 --> 39:57.728
I think you need to leave.

39:57.895 --> 39:58.938
-Levon...

39:59.105 --> 40:01.023
He's one of the good guys.
That's who he is.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.483
Isobel. I've got this. Okay?

40:02.566 --> 40:04.693
I remember you. From the morgue.

40:04.985 --> 40:06.404
And you were at the execution.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.322
You two huddled up. And I watched you,

40:08.406 --> 40:09.824
and I thought, "What are they doing?"

40:09.907 --> 40:11.951
And you know the word
that popped into my head?

40:12.118 --> 40:14.537
"Conspiring. That's what they're doing."

40:14.870 --> 40:16.580
Conspiring. Isn't that weird?

40:24.922 --> 40:27.466
You're her, aren't you? You're Renegade.

40:28.384 --> 40:29.218
Oh.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.303
Of course, you are.

40:32.972 --> 40:35.558
Seattle needed a hero,
and guess who volunteered.

40:35.724 --> 40:39.395
The girl who can't find meaning
in her life any other way.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.314
This is gonna get you killed, Liv. But, hey, you were
willing to get me killed, too.

40:44.191 --> 40:46.152
And for who Huh?

40:46.235 --> 40:49.071
Who is he to you?
Was he worth risking my life?

40:49.155 --> 40:50.614
It's time for you to go, buddy.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.748
Get out! Just go!

41:00.875 --> 41:01.792
Go!
