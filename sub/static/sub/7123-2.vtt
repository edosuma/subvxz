I warned you.

00:40.340 --> 00:44.606
<i>I can hear the crown's promise</i>
<i>of power invading my brain.</i>

00:52.018 --> 00:53.349
Destiny Gang!!

01:00.126 --> 01:01.787
Careful, there.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.488
Careful!

01:03.563 --> 01:04.894
You dankus!

01:04.964 --> 01:06.454
Oh, Simon.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.898
Aah!

01:12.972 --> 01:14.940
One more hit,
and that baby's gonna burst!

01:16.009 --> 01:17.909
Ice lightning!

01:19.879 --> 01:21.676
Ah, Dingo.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.918
What's happening?!

01:30.523 --> 01:38.650
Bar-bar! I'll save you!
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

01:41.668 --> 01:43.135
Finn?

01:43.203 --> 01:44.795
Finn!

01:44.871 --> 01:46.736
Hey, guy, where's my buddy?

01:46.806 --> 01:49.240
Oh, when he wished for the
Lich to have never existed...

01:50.944 --> 01:52.309
...Finn left my
time room and

01:52.378 --> 01:54.437
entered his
wish-altered reality.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.277
We can watch him
on my TV wall.

01:59.986 --> 02:01.613
Oh...

02:01.688 --> 02:02.746
Whoa.

02:02.822 --> 02:04.983
Alternate-wish-world
Finn is mad uglies.

02:05.992 --> 02:07.983
Dang,
I'm mad uglies, too!

02:10.130 --> 02:11.597
Everything looks nuts.

02:11.664 --> 02:12.961
Yes.

02:13.032 --> 02:16.729
Sometimes a well-intentioned
wish can lead to... nuts.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.966
But, you know,
<i>you</i> get a wish, too.

02:20.039 --> 02:20.971
What?!

02:21.040 --> 02:22.200
Yep, totally.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.244
You can have
anything you want.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.906
I wish for...
a sandwich!

02:28.982 --> 02:30.142
A sandwich?

02:30.216 --> 02:32.116
You're gonna waste your
one wish on a sandwich?

02:32.185 --> 02:33.982
You don't want anything else?

02:34.053 --> 02:35.611
Nah, a sandwich is good.

02:35.688 --> 02:37.155
Maybe about this big.

02:37.223 --> 02:38.918
Or... this big.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.516
On ciabatta bread, maybe?

02:40.593 --> 02:41.719
Hmm, I don't know.

02:41.794 --> 02:42.624
Whatever you got around.

02:42.695 --> 02:43.684
Your choice.

02:43.763 --> 02:45.321
Dude, I'll just
make you a sandwich.

02:45.398 --> 02:48.856
You should use your wish
on something important.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.665
You know, on someone
who might need it?

02:53.907 --> 02:55.534
I'm talking about
him over there.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.200
Oh.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.446
Oh!

03:03.516 --> 03:04.483
Finn?

03:08.288 --> 03:11.018
What...
what on Earth did this?

03:11.090 --> 03:12.318
I did this.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.519
No. That's not possible.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.357
I raised you
better than that!

03:16.429 --> 03:17.623
It's true.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.524
I put out the fire!

03:22.602 --> 03:25.070
But I also made the bomb go off.

03:26.306 --> 03:29.833
The crown... it compels
me to ice up everything!!

03:38.284 --> 03:39.842
I'm sorry, mom. Dad.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.011
Little sibling.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.582
I'm too dangerous
to be around.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.591
W-what are you doing?

03:46.659 --> 03:48.650
Take them far away,
Bar-Bar.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.320
Leave me!

03:50.396 --> 03:52.364
Leave me.

03:52.432 --> 03:55.401
Looks like your friend is
having a pretty rough time.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.868
Hmm, yeah.

03:57.937 --> 03:59.666
But, well,
it's Finn's wish.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.331
Let's just see
how it plays out.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.999
I got confidence in my boy.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.044
Besides, I'll hang on to
my wish in case I need it.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.340
Aw!

04:09.415 --> 04:11.042
Don't worry, dude.
I got you covered.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.516
They're homemade.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.917
I love you, Prismo.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.012
Oh!

04:18.658 --> 04:19.988
I'm serious, man.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.789
You're like a strong
number 3 on my cool guys list.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.262
Oh, man, my dad used
to make pickles.

04:25.331 --> 04:26.628
It's all he used
to talk about.

04:26.699 --> 04:28.633
He'd obsess over
them all the time.

04:28.701 --> 04:29.861
When I'd come in from playing,

04:29.936 --> 04:31.961
he'd be like
"Here, Jake, try these."

04:33.539 --> 04:35.598
And they'd be
pretty crunchy, actually.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.540
You'd think they'd be soft,
but they weren't.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.976
I'd be like, "Wow, dad,
you made these pretty good."

04:40.046 --> 04:41.013
Mmm.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.445
Yeah, that was dad.

04:46.686 --> 04:49.052
Rise,
my wintry warriors.

04:50.923 --> 04:51.753
Tromo!

04:51.824 --> 04:52.791
Trami!

04:52.859 --> 04:55.089
Why am I cold and confused?

04:55.161 --> 04:56.856
Fear not, icicle child,

04:56.929 --> 04:58.692
for I have birthed
you into a new life!

04:58.765 --> 05:01.063
Huh? The Mertens kid?

05:01.134 --> 05:04.661
An age of ice and
whispering sno-o-ow!

05:06.406 --> 05:08.772
Hey! Cronk me loose, "T!"

05:08.841 --> 05:10.138
Come on!

05:11.544 --> 05:13.535
You see Big
Destiny anywhere?

05:13.613 --> 05:15.877
Big D's chillin'
over here,

05:15.948 --> 05:17.347
Wasteland style.

05:18.651 --> 05:19.481
Boss!

05:19.552 --> 05:20.541
Come back!

05:20.620 --> 05:21.712
Oww.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.688
Only I can protect y'all.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.314
Stay.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.449
Aah! My kicks!

05:26.526 --> 05:27.720
Can't you hear the...

05:27.794 --> 05:28.886
The whispers?

05:28.961 --> 05:30.656
Forget Big D! Let's go!

05:31.898 --> 05:34.662
I've taught you well,
my traitorous gang.

05:35.768 --> 05:36.792
Hmm?

05:36.869 --> 05:38.996
The voices, they tell
me to freeze the world.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.300
Get off of me, weirdo!

05:40.373 --> 05:42.466
I am the end
and the beginning.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.033
I am the hand of madness.

05:46.713 --> 05:47.543
Jake?

05:49.949 --> 05:51.314
Dude, I get out of relationships

05:51.384 --> 05:53.011
because I don't want to have
a discussion about what

05:53.086 --> 05:55.611
we're gonna have for
dinner every night.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.349
'Cause when I'm alone,
I can just sit on the couch

05:57.423 --> 05:59.152
till I'm hungry
and eat whatever I want.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.556
It's not like,

06:00.626 --> 06:01.854
"What should we eat for breakfast?

06:01.928 --> 06:03.589
We should coordinate."

06:03.663 --> 06:05.858
That's a pain.

06:05.932 --> 06:09.424
Man, your view of relationships is very bleak.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.163
Don't you get lonely?

06:11.237 --> 06:12.363
I have friends.

06:12.438 --> 06:13.700
Hello, hello!

06:13.773 --> 06:15.001
Hey, so,
I brought over the...

06:16.943 --> 06:19.503
What is a singular
doing in this realm?

06:19.579 --> 06:21.547
He's just here making
a wish, cosmic owl.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.241
But I brought games.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.840
We were gonna hang.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.282
After.

06:26.352 --> 06:28.013
Come on. Get in here.

06:28.087 --> 06:29.611
Okay.

06:34.727 --> 06:35.853
Jake?

06:35.928 --> 06:37.225
Jake!

06:39.565 --> 06:41.760
I warned you,
you butt.

06:41.834 --> 06:42.732
Whoa!

06:51.911 --> 06:53.435
Don't worry, Jake.

06:53.513 --> 06:56.914
I'll share the secrets
of ice and snow with thee.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.507
The power of frost!

06:58.584 --> 07:00.108
The power of frost!

07:00.186 --> 07:01.619
The power of fr...

07:03.923 --> 07:06.118
Three, two, one, go.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.820
We're three nice dudes,
havin' fun.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.229
We got warm bubble
water on our buns.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.290
I love this spa,
and that's a fact.

07:15.368 --> 07:18.030
But if I stay too long,
I get a "Pruney" back.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.239
<i>Jake?</i>

07:29.315 --> 07:30.805
<i>Jake, what are you doing?</i>

07:33.753 --> 07:35.084
Back off my crown,
Jake!

07:35.154 --> 07:36.519
I warn you!

07:36.589 --> 07:37.851
Hey, man,
I'm right here!

07:37.924 --> 07:39.050
That's not me, man!

07:45.465 --> 07:47.262
Finn!

07:47.333 --> 07:48.664
I'm in the spa bath!

07:48.734 --> 07:49.928
Oh, man.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.129
Maybe <i>now</i> you'd
like to use your wish?

07:52.205 --> 07:53.695
Make Finn okay!

07:53.773 --> 07:55.297
I wish for safe Finn!

07:55.374 --> 07:56.341
Wait!

07:56.409 --> 07:58.001
Dude, look, I like you.

07:58.077 --> 07:59.271
So you should
know my wishes

07:59.345 --> 08:00.972
always got an ironic
twist to them.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.776
It's like a monkey's
paw kind of thing.

08:02.849 --> 08:03.907
What?

08:03.983 --> 08:05.507
You just got to
be really specific.

08:05.585 --> 08:08.179
Say your wish is,
"I wish for a back rub."

08:08.254 --> 08:09.744
Who's gonna give it to you?

08:09.822 --> 08:12.518
A dirty man? A bear?

08:12.592 --> 08:15.288
And where does this
"masseuse" come from?

08:15.361 --> 08:18.091
Do I zap some guy away
from his family dinner?

08:18.164 --> 08:19.495
Leave some kid traumatized?

08:19.565 --> 08:21.692
"Mom, where did dad go?"

08:21.767 --> 08:23.064
"I don't know, son.

08:23.135 --> 08:24.864
He just disappeared
from the table.

08:24.937 --> 08:26.199
Sorry."

08:27.640 --> 08:29.870
You see, Jake,
there's rules to this stuff.

08:29.942 --> 08:32.775
Wishing an event to be changes
elements before and after it.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.312
Memories will be destroyed.

08:34.380 --> 08:35.573
Babies will not be born.

08:35.648 --> 08:40.381
Potential worlds could be
evaporated by your wish.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.583
Eww!

08:46.559 --> 08:48.424
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:48.494 --> 08:49.859
It's a lot of pressure, man.

08:49.929 --> 08:50.953
Focus, Jake.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.657
Here, eat this egg.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.723
It's brain food.

08:59.405 --> 09:00.770
Okay. Okay.

09:01.974 --> 09:03.236
Think. Think.

09:04.443 --> 09:08.277
Okay, there is a way to bring
back all life and get home.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.474
You just have to ch...

09:12.552 --> 09:14.019
cha...

09:14.086 --> 09:17.146
...aaaa...

09:17.223 --> 09:18.690
...ange!

09:18.758 --> 09:20.623
The Li...

09:20.693 --> 09:21.717
The lipstick!

09:21.794 --> 09:23.989
The Lich's...

09:24.063 --> 09:26.122
Oh, the Lich's...

09:26.198 --> 09:29.258
Wi...

09:29.335 --> 09:30.893
...ish.

09:31.971 --> 09:32.835
Change the Lich's wish!

09:32.905 --> 09:33.735
And go home.

09:33.806 --> 09:34.636
And go home!

09:34.707 --> 09:35.537
Okay.

09:35.608 --> 09:36.734
Okay, I wish...

09:36.809 --> 09:37.969
the Lich's wish...

09:38.044 --> 09:38.976
was for me...

09:39.045 --> 09:39.977
Uh!

09:40.046 --> 09:42.674
...and Finn to go
back home to Ooo.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.306
I can work with that.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.749
All right.
This has been nice.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.013
See you.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.819
I wish...

09:57.897 --> 10:00.365
for the extinction
of all li-i...

10:00.433 --> 10:04.563
for Finn and Jake to
go back home to Ooo.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.662
Huh? No, wait!

10:06.739 --> 10:07.865
That's not
what I wish for!

10:07.940 --> 10:09.703
Sorry, guy,
you only get one wish.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.106
Hey, Jake.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.337
Did you see that?

10:12.411 --> 10:13.343
Monkey's paw.

10:16.215 --> 10:17.307
Jake!

10:17.383 --> 10:18.247
What the...

10:18.317 --> 10:19.511
Why would the Lich wish...

10:19.585 --> 10:20.643
What? Jake?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.381
It worked!

10:22.455 --> 10:23.422
Jake! This is serious!

10:23.489 --> 10:24.979
Something really
messed up is happening!

10:26.225 --> 10:27.590
It already happened!

10:27.660 --> 10:28.854
And it never happened!

10:28.928 --> 10:29.895
What?!

10:29.962 --> 10:31.293
What happened?!

10:31.364 --> 10:32.228
Nothing.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.890
'Cause I saved everybody.

10:43.876 --> 10:46.242
Now, honey, I told you,
you can take the sign off

10:46.312 --> 10:48.837
when you tell me where you
hid Daddy's crown jewels.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.381
Wenk.

10:50.449 --> 10:51.507
Gunther!

10:51.584 --> 10:53.449
Huh?
