00:27.623 --> 00:28.817
Tara.

00:31.821 --> 00:34.310
Hi, I'm Brad Chase from D.C.

00:34.310 --> 00:35.564
Alan Shore.

00:35.564 --> 00:36.736
Pleasure.

00:36.736 --> 00:39.076
I think that's my seat.

00:39.076 --> 00:40.996
Yes, I did see someone's things here.

00:40.996 --> 00:44.661
I moved them to a less desirable location.

00:48.006 --> 00:54.223
I'm sorry. We're not territorial about
that sort of thing around here,
are we?

00:57.753 --> 00:58.875
Denny Crane.

00:58.875 --> 01:01.054
Yes, Denny, I know.
I run the New York office.

01:01.054 --> 01:02.703
Oh! Peter Stone.

01:02.703 --> 01:04.793
–Denny Crane.
–I know. I'm Chicago.

01:04.793 --> 01:08.340
My kind of town. Always had
the best sex of my life in Chicago.

01:08.340 --> 01:09.349
What about you?

01:09.349 --> 01:10.501
Well, um…

01:10.501 --> 01:12.488
Greetings, Tokyo, London.

01:12.488 --> 01:13.901
Good morning.

01:13.901 --> 01:15.110
Morning, Denny.

01:15.110 --> 01:18.648
Brad Chase, there you are, soldier.

01:18.648 --> 01:22.993
Oh. Everybody remembers
Brad Chase, I'm sure, hell, if I do.

01:22.993 --> 01:25.477
It's good to see you, man.
All right, everybody.

01:25.477 --> 01:27.294
Lock and load.

01:28.073 --> 01:29.670
Item one,

01:29.670 --> 01:31.882
forget item one.

01:31.882 --> 01:36.239
Actually, Denny, item one is a rather
urgent matter that we must discuss.

01:36.239 --> 01:37.576
Why don't you brief us?

01:37.576 --> 01:40.074
Gladly. If we…

01:40.074 --> 01:42.564
Item two, Beckerman discovery?
What the hell is that?

01:42.564 --> 01:45.866
Uh, well, opposing counsel was
granted their motion to compel,

01:45.866 --> 01:47.536
which means we are now required

01:47.536 --> 01:50.927
to turn over all correspondence
and scientific studies.

01:50.927 --> 01:53.492
What about the ones we burned
before the judge's order?

01:53.492 --> 01:54.989
We didn't burn any documents.

01:54.989 --> 01:57.200
Well, sure we did.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.200
Do it today.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.998
All right, Nigel, keep going.
We're listening.

02:01.998 --> 02:03.503
Uh, if we don't…

02:03.503 --> 02:04.961
Item three.

02:04.961 --> 02:08.190
Damn it, Denny, this is not a way
to conduct a staff meeting.

02:08.190 --> 02:12.643
–Where the hell is Edwin?
–Sorry I'm late, good people.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.497
Is it casual Monday?

02:31.497 --> 02:32.951
Edwin…

02:33.847 --> 02:35.640
everything all right?

02:35.640 --> 02:37.876
Hunky dory.

02:39.816 --> 02:41.011
Unbelievable.

02:41.011 --> 02:42.111
Not really.

02:42.111 --> 02:44.569
Always figured him for a loon.

02:44.569 --> 02:46.545
Tara! Where's Tara?

02:46.545 --> 02:48.302
I need Tara!

02:48.810 --> 02:50.862
I'm right here, Edwin.

02:50.862 --> 02:52.341
Oh, thank you.

02:52.341 --> 02:53.797
You have to contact Bill.

02:53.797 --> 02:55.215
I, I will, Edwin. I promise.

02:55.215 --> 02:57.094
Apologize for my delay.
Then call my wife.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.458
Tell her I've had a smallbreakdown, 
not to worry. –Of course.

02:59.458 --> 03:01.102
Oh, my goodness.
I have the Brant appeal.

03:01.102 --> 03:04.865
–I have the Brant appeal.
–Relax, Edwin, we'll handle it.

03:04.865 --> 03:08.902
Denny, guess what, I'm due
in court with Tara.

03:08.902 --> 03:11.180
We're on it. Don't you worry.

03:11.180 --> 03:12.674
You just get better.

03:12.674 --> 03:13.536
Okay.

03:13.536 --> 03:15.348
Demagnetize his parking pass.

03:15.348 --> 03:17.709
–I beg your pardon?
–I know when a man is gone.

03:17.709 --> 03:21.076
Do you think you can handle
this case without a copilot?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.206
Well, I'm not…

03:22.206 --> 03:23.195
Who's the judge?

03:23.195 --> 03:25.370
–Resnick.
–He's a schmuck.

03:25.370 --> 03:29.410
Alan, back Tara up.
She's before schmuck Resnick.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.888
See if you can get a damn continuance.

03:31.888 --> 03:33.460
Brad, you got a few minutes?

03:33.460 --> 03:35.022
Actually, no.
I've got an early shuttle.

03:35.022 --> 03:36.818
Get a later one.
I need some face time.

03:36.818 --> 03:37.479
What's up?

03:37.479 --> 03:41.622
Edwin Poole was the only one here
able to rein in Denny Crane without him.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.644
If you are about to go
where I think you're going…

03:43.644 --> 03:46.143
We need you back in Boston
more than in D.C., Brad.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.374
Lori, Erni Dell just came in.
He's upset about something.

03:49.374 --> 03:51.414
I sent him to your office.
–My office?

03:51.414 --> 03:53.325
Yeah, the alternative would
be Denny's office,

03:53.325 --> 03:54.476
and nobody here wants that.

03:54.476 --> 03:57.968
Excuse me. I need a lawyer.

03:57.968 --> 03:59.151
This is my daughter.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.553
She tried out for the national
tour of Annie,

04:01.553 --> 04:03.274
and she was the best one,

04:03.274 --> 04:05.890
and she was passed over
because she was black.

04:05.890 --> 04:07.328
It's discrimination,

04:07.328 --> 04:09.407
it's bigotry, it's prejudice,

04:09.407 --> 04:12.546
and we want justice.

04:14.861 --> 04:18.676
Boston Legal
Head Cases

04:43.804 --> 04:45.964
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2004/10/03

04:46.675 --> 04:49.565
Please tell me that you've never
seen anything like that before.

04:49.565 --> 04:53.028
Baring your ass to 24 attorneys
including two overseas,

04:53.028 --> 04:56.132
that is an unprecedented triumph.

04:56.132 --> 04:59.428
I'm just distraught
I didn't think of it myself.

04:59.428 --> 05:01.502
You know what I like about you?

05:01.502 --> 05:02.720
No, I do not.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.729
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

05:04.729 --> 05:05.639
Brad Chase.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.194
Look, I've been asked to stay,
which I'm considering,

05:07.194 --> 05:09.227
but I'm concerned that you and I
may have gotten off on the wrong foot.

05:09.227 --> 05:12.035
I like to be straight up with people,
and if there's an issue or conflict,

05:12.035 --> 05:15.214
let's address it head-on,
if you don't mind.

05:15.757 --> 05:18.654
I have trouble talking that fast.

05:18.654 --> 05:20.876
I don't believe in being straight up,

05:20.876 --> 05:25.617
but I'm a big fan of your
aqua velva commercials.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.618
There's a potential client
in the conference room.

05:27.618 --> 05:28.745
I'd like for you to meet with her.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.088
Oh, forgot to mention,

05:31.088 --> 05:32.144
I outrank you.

05:32.144 --> 05:33.384
Do you?

05:33.384 --> 05:35.917
And I'm such a slut for authority.

05:35.917 --> 05:41.549
All right, you think the two little boys
could get off the playground now?

05:48.507 --> 05:50.744
–Kiss today.
–I don't want to sing.

05:50.744 --> 05:53.069
You need to practice.
You want to make Juilliard?

05:53.069 --> 05:54.587
Kiss today.

05:58.670 --> 06:04.537
Kiss today goodbye.

06:04.537 --> 06:05.678
Oh, my.

06:05.678 --> 06:07.562
Never mind “oh, my.”

06:07.562 --> 06:09.155
She sings like a sparrow.

06:09.155 --> 06:10.649
Here, look.

06:10.649 --> 06:11.767
I've got these producer notes,

06:11.767 --> 06:14.791
which I was able to get ahold of
because of my own personal ingenuity,

06:14.791 --> 06:16.379
says she has the most talent.

06:16.379 --> 06:18.437
You can read it for yourself.

06:18.437 --> 06:20.275
I'm afraid there's been
a terrible mistake.

06:20.275 --> 06:21.970
I don't do musical comedy.

06:21.970 --> 06:23.511
Annie's a drama.

06:23.511 --> 06:24.837
It's full of suspense

06:24.837 --> 06:27.050
on whether the little girl
gets to live with the rich guy.

06:27.050 --> 06:29.556
It's dramatic.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.869
Can I help you? –Yes, I need to
speak to Edwin Poole immediately.

06:40.869 --> 06:43.157
I'm afraid Mr Poole has stepped
out. –You don't understand.

06:43.157 --> 06:45.128
This is an urgent matter.

06:45.128 --> 06:46.480
Where the hell is Edwin Poole?

06:46.480 --> 06:48.354
Hi. Is there anything
I can do to help?

06:48.354 --> 06:52.419
Yes. My ex-husband is trying
to take my children from me,

06:52.419 --> 06:54.943
and Edwin Poole, he missed
my hearing today,

06:54.943 --> 06:57.539
and I've been calling
his cell phone, and…

06:57.539 --> 06:59.475
I mean, what the hell is
going on around here?

06:59.475 --> 07:01.451
Excuse me.
I'm Brad Chase.

07:01.451 --> 07:03.009
We're gonna take care of this for you.

07:03.009 --> 07:04.910
Now, why don't you just take
a seat in the conference room?

07:04.910 --> 07:07.265
I'll get you a glass of water.

07:07.265 --> 07:08.610
All right.

07:09.005 --> 07:10.699
Thank you.

07:11.424 --> 07:12.217
–Hey. 
–Yeah.

07:12.217 --> 07:13.690
–I was handling it.
–I just thought I'd help out.

07:13.690 --> 07:15.470
That's very nice, but again,
I was handling it.

07:15.470 --> 07:17.144
So why does it bother you
that I'm trying to help?

07:17.144 --> 07:19.504
Well, maybe because you feel
I can't deal with a client on my own.

07:19.504 --> 07:20.662
I don't feel that way at all.

07:20.662 --> 07:22.623
Well, then I guess I really have
no idea what you feel.

07:22.623 --> 07:25.199
I guess not. –And that's
supposed to be my fault?

07:25.199 --> 07:27.595
Wait a minute.

07:27.595 --> 07:30.270
You two have had sex.

07:40.337 --> 07:41.444
I'm sorry.

07:41.444 --> 07:45.779
We're not territorial about that
sort of thing around here, are we?

07:55.082 --> 07:57.681
You're not gonna tell me.

07:58.425 --> 08:00.884
I would prefer to tell Denny.

08:00.884 --> 08:02.193
–Where the hell is he?
–Ernie,

08:02.193 --> 08:05.228
you and I have done
business for a long time,

08:05.228 --> 08:07.478
and we've always been able
to talk to each other.

08:07.478 --> 08:10.406
If I'm to help you here…

08:13.035 --> 08:16.450
My wife is cheating on me.

08:18.438 --> 08:25.512
And she informed me that she has been
cheating on me for our entire marriage.

08:25.512 --> 08:27.959
It's been a fraud from day one.

08:27.959 --> 08:31.671
Okay. First, you've only
been married since August.

08:31.671 --> 08:34.496
Second, you've had five other
marriages dissolve, each…

08:34.496 --> 08:37.984
But this, this was the real thing.

08:37.984 --> 08:40.037
What's the goal, to get her back?

08:40.037 --> 08:43.885
I, I'd like to put a private
investigator on her, get some proof.

08:43.885 --> 08:44.940
If she's admitted…

08:44.940 --> 08:47.929
Goal being to get some compromising
pictures to use as leverage.

08:47.929 --> 08:50.894
In hopes of…

08:50.894 --> 08:54.325
Negotiating an annulment.

08:55.302 --> 08:56.849
I know it sounds crazy,

08:56.849 --> 09:00.571
and I know I'm one of those
obnoxious stage mothers. I get that.

09:00.571 --> 09:02.241
But Sarah worked hard.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.077
I've tried to teach her what you earn,

09:04.077 --> 09:05.946
people can't take that away from you.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.632
She's earned this, Mr Shore.

09:07.632 --> 09:09.177
I have no doubt,

09:09.177 --> 09:11.758
but you realize producers
do have discretion on that,

09:11.758 --> 09:15.076
and the art of casting strikes me
as a very inexact science.

09:15.076 --> 09:18.065
If they knew they were gonna go white,
why'd they let her try out at all?

09:18.065 --> 09:20.467
Why'd they let her get her hopes up?

09:20.467 --> 09:21.961
I'll tell you why.

09:21.961 --> 09:25.735
so they can pass themselves off
as equal-opportunity employers,

09:25.735 --> 09:28.269
so they can claim to be about diversity.

09:28.269 --> 09:34.758
They want it both ways, Mr Shore,
and my daughter got hurt.

09:45.031 --> 09:46.674
That was our deal.

09:46.674 --> 09:49.655
I would work two jobs,
put him through business school,

09:49.655 --> 09:52.404
then he would put me
through medical school.

09:52.404 --> 09:55.808
A week after he graduated,
he got a job running a mutual fund,

09:55.808 --> 09:58.937
and a week after that, he left me.

09:58.937 --> 10:01.187
Our kids were 4 then.

10:01.187 --> 10:02.654
Twins.

10:02.654 --> 10:04.740
Simon and Harry.

10:05.177 --> 10:07.050
They're 8 now.

10:07.317 --> 10:08.584
Oh, they're beautiful.

10:08.584 --> 10:09.659
Thanks.

10:09.659 --> 10:12.162
In their peewee league uniforms.

10:12.162 --> 10:14.410
You know, he's never seen
one of their games.

10:14.410 --> 10:15.823
He pay your way through med school?

10:15.823 --> 10:17.907
Take a wild guess.

10:17.907 --> 10:20.148
I don't care, though.
I've graduated now,

10:20.148 --> 10:22.801
I've got a residency waiting
for me in New York city,

10:22.801 --> 10:25.566
but Matthew won't let me
take the boys out of state.

10:25.566 --> 10:29.477
Says he wants them close by,
these boys he sees once a month.

10:29.477 --> 10:31.207
It's nothing but spite.

10:31.207 --> 10:33.486
Now, look, we're gonna reschedule a hearing.

10:33.486 --> 10:35.060
I'm sure everything is
going to work out fine.

10:35.060 --> 10:37.455
You just have to be patient.

10:37.455 --> 10:40.169
If I'm not at Columbia Presbyterian
8:00 A.M. Monday morning,

10:40.169 --> 10:42.647
they will give my spot away.

10:42.647 --> 10:49.931
That can't happen. I have worked too
hard to build a life for these boys.

10:57.258 --> 10:58.585
We can't tail the wife.

10:58.585 --> 11:00.145
It's what he wants, Denny.

11:00.145 --> 11:03.089
Can't do it. Not ethical.

11:03.089 --> 11:04.221
She's a client, too.

11:04.221 --> 11:05.741
What I would suggest

11:05.741 --> 11:09.012
is we send a letter
of withdrawal to end-run the conflict,

11:09.012 --> 11:12.755
get an opinion letter of outside
counsel… –I don't want to tail the wife.

11:12.755 --> 11:17.097
Denny, I don't need to tell you
that Ernie Dell is one of
our biggest clients.

11:17.097 --> 11:19.937
If he wants a private investigator,
what's the real harm?

11:19.937 --> 11:22.237
The harm would be to me.

11:22.237 --> 11:24.585
I'm sorry?

11:25.270 --> 11:29.322
I'm the one sleeping with his wife.

11:38.969 --> 11:41.846
Denny is having an affair with the woman.

11:41.846 --> 11:43.735
I've got a senior partner
saying don't tail her,

11:43.735 --> 11:46.361
I've got a client wanting snapshots.

11:46.361 --> 11:48.797
What do I do, Paul?

11:50.482 --> 11:54.436
Convince Ernie that the private
investigator idea is a bad one.

11:54.436 --> 11:56.575
Oh, sure.

11:56.575 --> 12:00.410
You have enormous persuasive skills, Lori.

12:00.410 --> 12:02.285
You're handling me.

12:02.285 --> 12:04.296
I am.

12:04.296 --> 12:10.751
And I need you to handle Ernie.
I will handle Denny.

12:16.185 --> 12:17.469
Tara?

12:17.469 --> 12:18.994
Hi.

12:26.752 --> 12:28.801
Don't be offended by this.

12:28.801 --> 12:35.292
I know you're a great lawyer
with exceptional legal skills.

12:35.292 --> 12:36.787
And?

12:36.787 --> 12:38.794
I need you to flirt with Ernie Dell.

12:38.794 --> 12:41.559
Excuse me? –The man is
a profound skirt chaser.

12:41.559 --> 12:43.156
What's wrong with your skirt?

12:43.156 --> 12:45.585
Okay, look, men sometimes
find me attractive.

12:45.585 --> 12:47.118
From time to time, they'll even hit on me.

12:47.118 --> 12:50.964
It's all deeply rewarding, but you…

12:50.964 --> 12:53.146
What me?

12:53.146 --> 12:55.219
You're hot.

12:55.219 --> 12:59.514
Yeah. Kind of… nasty hot.

12:59.514 --> 13:00.922
Men would leave their wives for you,

13:00.922 --> 13:02.908
and I need to make Ernie
forget about his wife, so…

13:02.908 --> 13:04.911
–If you think that I…
–Don't make me pull rank.

13:04.911 --> 13:06.933
You can file your sexual
harrassment claim tomorrow,

13:06.933 --> 13:11.488
but today, now, you need
to meet with Ernie.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.833
It seems the client can't pay,

13:14.833 --> 13:18.166
so the firm will have to eat the cost
of prosecuting this matter.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.722
I'm sure the partners won't object

13:20.722 --> 13:22.967
when they hear that it was
a case you assigned to me.

13:22.967 --> 13:24.295
I'll tell you what.

13:24.295 --> 13:28.978
I'll pay the cost of prosecuting the case.

13:29.363 --> 13:33.022
Of course, if you were a betting man…

13:33.259 --> 13:36.674
You win, I pay,
you lose, you pay.

13:36.674 --> 13:39.137
Bit of a gamble, I realize.

13:39.137 --> 13:41.382
I'll pay double.

13:55.258 --> 13:56.257
You got another hearing?

13:56.257 --> 13:59.550
That's the good news.
The not-so-good news is
we probably won't win it.

13:59.550 --> 14:02.596
But it at least gives us leverage
to get your ex-husband in a room.

14:02.596 --> 14:03.456
Wait, wait.

14:03.456 --> 14:05.165
What are you talking about?

14:05.165 --> 14:07.225
We want to take a shot at a settlement.

14:07.225 --> 14:10.485
Now, if your ex cares anything
about these kids… –He doesn't.

14:10.485 --> 14:13.769
This is all about getting me.
Have I not been clear about that?

14:13.769 --> 14:15.464
He doesn't even know the kids.

14:15.464 --> 14:17.251
I've dealt with bad ex-husbands before.

14:17.251 --> 14:22.504
Mr Chase, no offense, but
you have never dealt with this one.

14:22.504 --> 14:24.616
Trust me.

14:30.567 --> 14:32.473
This is little orphan Annie,
for God's sake.

14:32.473 --> 14:33.686
If she doesn't look the part.

14:33.686 --> 14:36.252
I didn't realize we did racial profiling
for our comic strip characters.

14:36.252 --> 14:39.169
These are private investors.
There is no state action involved.

14:39.169 --> 14:42.329
How would the story change
if Annie were black?

14:42.329 --> 14:43.544
Your honor, are you serious?

14:43.544 --> 14:46.462
Counsel, we are talking
about adoption here.

14:46.462 --> 14:48.895
Daddy Warbucks isn't the biological father.

14:48.895 --> 14:50.490
Exactly how would the story change?

14:50.490 --> 14:53.368
Little orphan Annie is
an iconic character based…

14:53.368 --> 14:55.360
I want to see her.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.772
–Excuse me?
–The girl who got the role.

14:57.772 --> 14:58.841
I want to compare.

14:58.841 --> 15:00.992
Your honor, is that really
fair to the other little girl?

15:00.992 --> 15:03.827
Counsel, if she can sing
eight times a week

15:03.827 --> 15:07.857
in front of 3,000-plus people a night,
she can sing in front of me.

15:07.857 --> 15:10.288
Get her in here.

15:12.092 --> 15:15.368
I want the private investigator.

15:15.368 --> 15:18.379
The thing is, Ernie, the photographs
will have no legal relevance.

15:18.379 --> 15:20.565
They can't facilitate an annulment.

15:20.565 --> 15:23.089
I am the customer here, Lori.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.470
The customer isn't always right.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.273
May I…

15:36.128 --> 15:38.371
make an observation?

15:38.371 --> 15:40.354
I really don't know you, Mr Dell,

15:40.354 --> 15:41.726
but I suspect there's a reason

15:41.726 --> 15:44.813
why all these younger women
want to marry you.

15:44.813 --> 15:45.990
It's called money.

15:45.990 --> 15:48.051
You're wrong.

15:48.411 --> 15:50.536
It's called power,

15:50.536 --> 15:54.171
and you derive a lot of that power
not just from being handsome and…

15:54.171 --> 15:55.955
sexy,

15:55.955 --> 15:58.816
but from being dignified.

15:58.816 --> 16:02.619
Hiring a private investigator
is beneath you.

16:02.619 --> 16:05.072
There are many young,
beautiful women out there

16:05.072 --> 16:10.662
who would love to jump into your…

16:10.662 --> 16:14.067
wife's place.

16:14.067 --> 16:17.800
I know this sounds crazy, but…

16:17.800 --> 16:23.378
you might want to look at this
as an opportunity.

16:41.974 --> 16:43.274
Paul.

16:44.059 --> 16:46.721
You and I go back a long way, Denny.

16:46.721 --> 16:50.280
Completely mindful of the fact
that you helped build this place,

16:50.280 --> 16:57.186
the partners here will not allow you
to dismantle it with your buffoonery.

16:57.186 --> 16:58.508
What did you say to me?

16:58.508 --> 17:02.506
I don't think you want
to hear me say it again.

17:02.506 --> 17:06.863
To have an affair with the wife
of one of our biggest clients,

17:06.863 --> 17:11.173
it disrespects both Ernie Dell
and this firm.

17:11.173 --> 17:14.641
–We have other clients.
–Not like Ernie.

17:14.641 --> 17:17.755
But your point is well taken.

17:17.755 --> 17:23.608
Everybody is fungible.

17:34.978 --> 17:38.420
Lori Colson won't tail my wife.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.132
I want you to do it. –Ernie.

17:40.132 --> 17:42.317
I'm not talking to you.

17:42.317 --> 17:46.104
Get it done, Denny.

17:57.804 --> 18:00.832
Denny, I'm having a bit of
an identity crisis.

18:00.832 --> 18:03.604
I've always prided myself on being,

18:03.604 --> 18:06.386
well… nuts.

18:06.386 --> 18:12.148
But in this firm, I find myself falling
into the sane category.

18:16.353 --> 18:19.170
You think I'm nuts, do you?

18:19.170 --> 18:21.704
Are you scared?

18:21.704 --> 18:23.529
Scared?

18:24.638 --> 18:27.896
What would I be scared of?

18:28.181 --> 18:30.121
Edwin Poole is a friend.

18:30.121 --> 18:33.690
You've seen him just go off the high dive.

18:33.690 --> 18:37.560
Edwin Poole's problem is he
doesn't like being Edwin Poole.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.295
From time to time, he'd…

18:39.295 --> 18:41.076
look in the mirror and ask,

18:41.076 --> 18:44.041
“what's the point?”
I never do that.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.965
Questions like that'll kill you.

18:45.965 --> 18:48.013
Questions like “what's the point?”

18:48.013 --> 18:50.393
Look, take you for example.

18:50.393 --> 18:52.091
Tomorrow you're gonna go into court

18:52.091 --> 18:53.846
and argue that some little fat black kid

18:53.846 --> 18:57.006
should be able to play
a little skinny white one.

18:57.006 --> 19:00.023
What's the point?

19:00.343 --> 19:05.566
You don't ask.
That's the point.

19:05.566 --> 19:07.891
You're gonna win, by the way?

19:07.891 --> 19:11.349
The world wants to know.

19:12.186 --> 19:14.760
I'm afraid not.

19:14.760 --> 19:15.759
There's no state action.

19:15.759 --> 19:21.069
We've asked for specific performance
with no clear evidence of discrimination.

19:21.069 --> 19:24.000
I don't like losing, especially
when there's a wager involved.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.826
Well, don't, soldier.

19:27.641 --> 19:32.551
Pull the rabbit out of your hat.

19:34.298 --> 19:41.307
That's the secret of both
trial law and life.

19:41.307 --> 19:43.407
Rabbits.

19:43.407 --> 19:45.313
Yeah.

19:54.588 --> 19:55.833
Excuse me.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.747
I'm looking for…

19:57.747 --> 20:01.082
you, actually. All my life.

20:01.082 --> 20:02.739
Matthew.

20:02.739 --> 20:04.004
Tara.

20:04.004 --> 20:05.609
Alan.

20:07.101 --> 20:10.741
I had a girl who looked like
you once, married her.

20:10.741 --> 20:12.913
Now she looks like you.

20:12.913 --> 20:16.334
Where the hell is my lawyer?

20:18.920 --> 20:21.749
If you took summer plus winter breaks,

20:21.749 --> 20:24.796
spring break, holiday weekends,

20:24.796 --> 20:27.033
you start to get pretty close
to what you have right now.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.206
Pass.

20:28.206 --> 20:30.366
That's too much custody for super dad.

20:30.366 --> 20:32.763
Is there any acceptable scenario

20:32.763 --> 20:34.939
that would allow for Sharon
to enroll in her program

20:34.939 --> 20:37.785
without leaving the boys behind?

20:37.785 --> 20:40.591
We could each take one.

20:40.591 --> 20:41.645
Excuse me?

20:41.645 --> 20:44.804
You know, like that nazi movie
where the woman has
to pick which kid to keep.

20:44.804 --> 20:47.001
–Sophie's choice.
–Thank you.

20:47.001 --> 20:49.079
Only this is Sharon's choice.

20:49.079 --> 20:51.331
One goes with her to New York,
I keep the other one.

20:51.331 --> 20:53.293
–Done.
–That's outrageous.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.614
The boys love each other.

20:54.614 --> 20:55.811
They're best friends.

20:55.811 --> 20:57.537
It's a little weird, don't you think?

20:57.537 --> 20:58.884
Let's see what happens
when we split them up.

20:58.884 --> 21:00.491
Stop doing this!

21:00.491 --> 21:03.993
You have already scarred your
children enough to last a lifetime.

21:03.993 --> 21:06.193
Imagine how that feels to a little boy,

21:06.193 --> 21:08.938
knowing that their father could
care less whether he sees them or not.

21:08.938 --> 21:11.773
And yet if it means denying me
something that I want,

21:11.773 --> 21:14.171
something that I deserve,
something that this family needs,

21:14.171 --> 21:17.022
suddenly you're a, you're
a concerned father.

21:17.022 --> 21:18.180
Damn you!

21:18.180 --> 21:19.563
And what about my needs, huh?

21:19.563 --> 21:23.401
What freakish nightmare did I step into
that turned my wife, who was hot,

21:23.401 --> 21:24.636
who had sex with me,

21:24.636 --> 21:28.035
who liked to go out with me at night
into some earth mother,

21:28.035 --> 21:30.835
world record-setting breast feeder.

21:30.835 --> 21:32.563
And now you wanna leave your kids

21:32.563 --> 21:35.592
with some non-english-speaking
nanny for 100 hours a week

21:35.592 --> 21:39.284
so you can live out your E.R
fantasy life? Be my guest.

21:39.284 --> 21:40.468
But it's not my problem

21:40.468 --> 21:47.637
that you're not good enough to get
hired anywhere in the entire state.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.696
Denny,

22:02.517 --> 22:05.329
you hire that P.I. yet?

22:05.329 --> 22:07.101
I asked you a question.

22:07.101 --> 22:10.295
Truth be told, my relationship with
this firm hangs in the balance.

22:10.295 --> 22:11.636
Uh, Ernie, why don't we
step into my office…

22:11.636 --> 22:13.484
I'm talking to Denny.

22:13.484 --> 22:15.698
All right, Ernie,

22:16.612 --> 22:20.507
truth time, my office.

22:21.641 --> 22:24.139
This is not gonna be
easy for you to hear,

22:24.139 --> 22:27.218
but it needs to be said.

22:27.984 --> 22:32.276
I don't give a damn who slept with
your wife. Neither do you, really.

22:32.276 --> 22:34.696
You don't love her.
This is an ego thing.

22:34.696 --> 22:38.505
She's a trophy girl,
something for your friends to admire.

22:38.505 --> 22:39.913
Maybe you should be flattered.

22:39.913 --> 22:41.997
–I'm not…
–I'm talking.

22:41.997 --> 22:43.857
Ego, Ernie.

22:43.857 --> 22:46.140
You acquire fast cars and young wives

22:46.140 --> 22:50.308
to try and stay young yourself in the
hope of confusing youth with relevance.

22:50.308 --> 22:53.310
Well, here's a flash for you.

22:53.957 --> 22:56.504
We're all desperate to be relevant.

22:56.504 --> 22:58.955
You're 76 years old.

22:58.955 --> 23:01.166
Wanna feel you still mean something?

23:01.166 --> 23:03.896
Move to Florida, punch a chad,
screw up an election.

23:03.896 --> 23:06.789
Don't go looking for affirmation

23:06.789 --> 23:10.143
between the two artificial jugs
of a woman who married you for…

23:10.143 --> 23:13.449
gee, could it be your outstanding
sense of humor?

23:13.449 --> 23:18.766
Take a swing if you want to,
if it makes you feel better.

23:27.488 --> 23:30.232
The guardian, Ad litem acknowledged
in her report in the last year

23:30.232 --> 23:33.055
Mr Calder took custody of the boys
only one weekend a month.

23:33.055 --> 23:35.808
Mr Calder has been steeped in
a major work crisis at his company.

23:35.808 --> 23:38.435
I don't care if he's been
dismantling a nuclear weapon.

23:38.435 --> 23:40.815
The fact is he hasn't been there,

23:40.815 --> 23:44.363
and there's no doubt that my client is,
in practice, the primary custodian.

23:44.363 --> 23:47.201
Now, this woman is struggling to make
a life for a family he doesn't..

23:47.201 --> 23:48.599
Wait, she can't make it
in the commonwealth?

23:48.599 --> 23:50.968
She'd love to, but the offer of
employment comes from New York.

23:50.968 --> 23:52.782
Now, my client has made every sacrifice.

23:52.782 --> 23:54.787
That's what parents do, Mr Chase.

23:54.787 --> 23:57.097
You have kids, you make sacrifices.

23:57.097 --> 24:00.825
They got married here,
they had children here.

24:00.825 --> 24:04.326
Mr Calder, as fathers go,

24:04.326 --> 24:07.574
I consider you a disgrace.

24:07.574 --> 24:10.726
Ms Brant, there is a reason for this policy.

24:10.726 --> 24:14.463
We don't like angry spouses
yanking kids across state lines.

24:14.463 --> 24:17.540
It's an undue burden on the family unit.

24:17.540 --> 24:25.069
Accordingly, your plan to relocate
with your sons remains enjoined.

24:33.892 --> 24:35.941
What now?

24:35.941 --> 24:37.940
I don't know.

24:41.792 --> 24:43.442
I, uh…

24:43.442 --> 24:47.099
I guess that didn't go too well.

24:49.367 --> 24:54.620
♫ When I'm stuck with a day
that's gray and lonely ♫

24:54.620 --> 25:01.476
♫ I just stick out my chin
and grin and say ♫

25:01.476 --> 25:05.716
♫ tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you, ♫

25:05.716 --> 25:12.489
♫ tomorrow, you're always a day away ♫

25:12.489 --> 25:13.534
Thank you. That…

25:13.534 --> 25:18.135
♫ Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you, ♫

25:18.135 --> 25:28.070
♫ tomorrow, you're always a day away ♫

25:33.009 --> 25:34.870
That was great.

25:34.870 --> 25:37.336
Sarah, that was magnificent,

25:37.336 --> 25:40.152
but the other little girl
was quite good, too,

25:40.152 --> 25:44.212
and given the discretion that has to be
allowed to producers in these situations..

25:44.212 --> 25:46.889
Your honor, we have something called
the equal protection clause,

25:46.889 --> 25:48.778
we have something called
the 14th amendment.

25:48.778 --> 25:50.857
I believe it's actually
required reading for judges.

25:50.857 --> 25:52.107
I could be wrong there.

25:52.107 --> 25:54.641
Could I be heard, your honor?

25:54.641 --> 25:56.561
I heard about this matter.

25:56.561 --> 25:59.801
I would like to address
this court on what I consider…

25:59.801 --> 26:02.986
I'm sorry, reverend,
but you have no standing here.

26:02.986 --> 26:05.510
I have standing as an American citizen

26:05.510 --> 26:07.836
speaking upon a civil rights violation.

26:07.836 --> 26:09.291
Reverend Sharpton I will
ask you to step down.

26:09.291 --> 26:10.965
I am standing as Bobby Kennedy was standing

26:10.965 --> 26:13.132
on the steps of the courthouse in Alabama.

26:13.132 --> 26:17.197
No one is denying this little
girl an education, sir.

26:17.197 --> 26:18.895
She just can't play Annie.

26:18.895 --> 26:23.202
You may think this is a small matter,
but this is no small matter.

26:23.202 --> 26:27.737
This child is being denied the right
to play an american icon

26:27.737 --> 26:30.911
because she doesn't match the description.

26:30.911 --> 26:35.145
Those descriptions were crafted 50 years ago.

26:35.145 --> 26:37.388
We supposed to be in a different day.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.644
Reverend…
–You talk about racial equality,

26:39.644 --> 26:41.615
how we're making progress.

26:41.615 --> 26:46.003
The problem with that progress is
it's always a day away.

26:46.003 --> 26:52.741
Tomorrow, tomorrow, you love that
because it's always a day away.

26:52.741 --> 26:56.935
I'm here to stick out
my chin today, today.

26:56.935 --> 27:00.058
Give us an African-american Spider-man.

27:00.058 --> 27:03.417
Give us a black that can run
faster than a speeding bullet

27:03.417 --> 27:06.963
and leap over tall buildings
in a single bound.

27:06.963 --> 27:09.448
Not tomorrow, today.

27:09.448 --> 27:12.565
Today. The sun needs to come out today,

27:12.565 --> 27:15.137
not tomorrow, your honor.

27:15.137 --> 27:19.522
God almighty, give the American
people a black orphan Annie.

27:19.522 --> 27:26.224
It's just not good enough
to say she doesn't look the part.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.390
That's what we call a rabbit, son.

27:33.390 --> 27:36.581
Denny Crane.

27:56.527 --> 27:59.780
What if we file a TRO in Federal court
on behalf of the kids?

27:59.780 --> 28:00.817
On what grounds?

28:00.817 --> 28:04.754
I don't know. They've been denied
a right to interstate travel.

28:04.754 --> 28:07.254
That's dubious.

28:07.923 --> 28:10.755
But I like your thinking.

28:11.666 --> 28:14.146
Come here for a second.

28:17.584 --> 28:19.573
Look…

28:20.451 --> 28:22.331
I just…

28:22.331 --> 28:25.936
I just need to know.

28:25.936 --> 28:27.545
Sally…

28:48.893 --> 28:50.711
Brad.

28:51.175 --> 28:52.882
Alan.

28:58.532 --> 29:01.120
The deadbeat doesn't even see
his kids, doesn't know them,

29:01.120 --> 29:07.924
and he's using them as weapons
to destroy his ex-wife and them.

29:09.902 --> 29:12.704
And that's why you were so upset?

29:12.704 --> 29:15.710
The case?

29:16.554 --> 29:18.976
It's a little hard, okay?

29:18.976 --> 29:22.907
I, I prefer him in D.C.

29:25.008 --> 29:26.766
Do you think I should start
working out with weights,

29:26.766 --> 29:28.516
maybe do some calisthenics?

29:28.516 --> 29:31.834
–Internally express my…
–Still like him?

29:31.834 --> 29:34.101
Well, what context are
you asking this, Alan?

29:34.101 --> 29:36.892
I mean, are you asking this
like a boyfriend, or…

29:36.892 --> 29:39.087
I'm not allowed to ask questions?

29:39.087 --> 29:41.986
Am I? About Tara?

29:41.986 --> 29:44.542
What about Tara?

29:47.070 --> 29:49.338
Nothing.

29:49.338 --> 29:56.691
Anyway, he left, I got very depressed, 
drank a lot, hit on too many boys…

29:56.691 --> 29:59.803
until I met this one boy.

29:59.803 --> 30:02.245
Man.

30:02.245 --> 30:04.724
Distinguished.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.257
And then I just…

30:12.106 --> 30:15.265
Okay, how small is the town
of Boston? –What?

30:15.265 --> 30:17.125
The dirtbag is right over there.

30:17.125 --> 30:18.684
Bradley?

30:18.902 --> 30:21.426
The ex-husband.

30:21.426 --> 30:25.447
Really trying to strengthen
that family unit.

30:27.668 --> 30:28.697
What are you doing?

30:28.697 --> 30:33.961
I just need to use your thingy for a second.

30:34.538 --> 30:37.309
Can we get out of here?
I don't, I don't want to look at that pig.

30:37.309 --> 30:38.539
Okay.

30:49.509 --> 30:51.053
We're off.

30:54.157 --> 30:57.065
I told him we're all desperate
to be relevant.

30:57.065 --> 30:58.673
Were you able to dissuade him?

30:58.673 --> 31:00.649
I think so.

31:03.562 --> 31:08.300
Denny, do you think you were talking
about yourself a little?

31:08.300 --> 31:12.723
You're feeling a little desperate
to be relevant lately.

31:12.723 --> 31:16.118
Don't waste your time trying
to get in my head.

31:16.118 --> 31:19.400
There's nothing there.

31:19.643 --> 31:22.491
They're not going to take
the firm from you.

31:22.491 --> 31:24.221
First, Paul Lewiston could
never get the votes.

31:24.221 --> 31:27.432
Second, he wouldn't want to.

31:27.432 --> 31:29.371
The man loves you.

31:29.371 --> 31:33.417
I'm not worried, Lori.
Do I look worried?

31:34.112 --> 31:37.166
Yeah, look out there.

31:38.791 --> 31:41.138
My domain.

31:42.682 --> 31:45.678
My city.

31:48.232 --> 31:51.552
I'm Denny Crane.

32:01.442 --> 32:03.070
I would be happy to buzz Mr Calder.

32:03.070 --> 32:05.021
You're very kind, but,
look, I'm already here.

32:05.021 --> 32:06.506
There's a meeting in progress, though,

32:06.506 --> 32:08.621
and I've been instructed
not to disturb him.

32:08.621 --> 32:09.629
Hello, Matthew.

32:09.629 --> 32:10.741
Shame.

32:10.741 --> 32:12.887
I was quite hoping to interrupt
something tawdry.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.248
I'm Alan Shore.

32:14.248 --> 32:15.686
Your colleague and I just met,

32:15.686 --> 32:18.916
but we seem to share a proclivity
for exotic women and illicit behavior.

32:18.916 --> 32:21.318
Can I steal you a second?

32:21.747 --> 32:22.705
What's going on?

32:22.705 --> 32:23.858
I'll keep it quick.

32:23.858 --> 32:25.034
These are for you.

32:25.034 --> 32:27.008
Photos. Snapshots, really.

32:27.008 --> 32:29.445
Some delightful little business
between you and a hooker.

32:29.445 --> 32:30.719
Friend of mine, actually.

32:30.719 --> 32:32.388
I earn frequent flyer miles.

32:32.388 --> 32:34.041
She's a lovely woman.

32:34.041 --> 32:36.434
I arranged for her to seek you
out at the bar.

32:36.434 --> 32:39.628
I particularly like
that one, don't you?

32:39.628 --> 32:43.585
Gives your bottom a nice aura.
Here's the deal.

32:43.585 --> 32:47.317
Sharon and the kids get to go to
New York or I start printing copies.

32:47.317 --> 32:49.335
Is that powdered sugar, by the way,

32:49.335 --> 32:52.929
that you're snorting off her
magnificent porcelain breasts?

32:52.929 --> 32:56.103
You are a lawyer in a prestigious
law firm, for God's sake.

32:56.103 --> 32:57.808
I know. Awful.

32:57.808 --> 32:58.934
Hate to extort and run,

32:58.934 --> 33:02.591
but I'm afraid I'll need
an answer on this now.

33:07.954 --> 33:08.827
Tara.

33:09.163 --> 33:12.640
I need to apologize.
I know how degrading that
had to be with Ernie, and…

33:12.640 --> 33:16.124
Not at all.
In fact, I slept with him last night.

33:16.124 --> 33:17.478
Anything for the team.

33:17.478 --> 33:19.271
Yeah, I suppose I deserve that.

33:19.271 --> 33:21.687
This wasn't so much for the team
as it is for Denny.

33:21.687 --> 33:24.299
–There's some stuff going on.
–What stuff?

33:24.299 --> 33:28.605
Denny, I need another moment.

33:34.496 --> 33:39.495
I was thinking how right you are
not to hire a private investigator.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.680
I thank you for your counsel.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.276
After all, it's possible
that I might learn something

33:44.276 --> 33:48.095
that could upset me even further.

33:48.095 --> 33:50.659
I hadn't considered that.

33:50.659 --> 33:52.637
Did you consider that, Denny?

33:52.637 --> 33:57.019
Ernie, I don't have time to consider
all the things I have to consider.

33:57.019 --> 33:59.539
–Should we sit?
–Oh, please.

34:00.805 --> 34:03.801
See, the thing is,

34:03.801 --> 34:05.173
the fool that I am,

34:05.173 --> 34:09.683
I went out and hired a P.I. on my own,

34:09.683 --> 34:12.422
and guess what I found out, Denny.

34:12.422 --> 34:13.701
I'm not sure, Ernie,

34:13.701 --> 34:20.065
but you need to know that I'm billing
you for all these rhetorical questions.

34:27.130 --> 34:30.193
My own lawyer…

34:30.193 --> 34:32.503
My friend…

34:33.012 --> 34:37.033
with my wife.

34:39.438 --> 34:42.434
Gee, Denny Crane is silent.

34:42.434 --> 34:46.121
Talk to me about my quest
for relevance, Denny.

34:46.121 --> 34:48.665
Tell me about my ego.

34:48.665 --> 34:54.880
Come up with one last profound thing
to say before I pull this trigger.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.514
Come on, Denny, talk.

34:56.514 --> 35:02.613
I want to hear what the great
Denny Crane has to say now.

35:05.356 --> 35:07.988
First off,

35:07.988 --> 35:11.323
clients come in here all the time
wanting to shoot me.

35:11.323 --> 35:12.782
You know what I tell them?

35:12.782 --> 35:15.321
Go ahead.

35:17.328 --> 35:21.417
The worst thing about growing older, Ernie,

35:21.417 --> 35:23.414
you begin to slip.

35:23.414 --> 35:25.344
One day you wake up and you're less than,

35:25.344 --> 35:28.939
and for me, I'm a legend, Ernie.

35:28.939 --> 35:30.679
I'm folklore in this town.

35:30.679 --> 35:33.096
Lawyers have feared me for years.

35:33.096 --> 35:36.690
For Denny Crane to slip,
it would diminish my legacy.

35:36.690 --> 35:39.679
It would be a tragedy.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.661
Denny Crane has to go out big,
page one of the Globe.

35:42.661 --> 35:47.355
New York Times, even.
Do me a favor, Ernie.

35:48.556 --> 35:51.296
Pull the trigger.

35:51.296 --> 35:52.947
Immortalize the legend.

35:52.947 --> 35:54.466
Pull the trigger.

35:54.466 --> 35:56.847
I don't ever want to be less than.

35:56.847 --> 36:01.660
Don't let me become irrelevant.
Pull it.

36:01.929 --> 36:03.502
Okay.

36:03.502 --> 36:05.751
But before I do,

36:05.751 --> 36:11.395
don't you at least want to apologize?

36:11.735 --> 36:13.534
I do.

36:13.534 --> 36:17.108
I'm sorry, my friend.

36:18.075 --> 36:21.648
I'm truly sorry.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.640
Ernie, uh,

36:29.640 --> 36:35.461
that gun, I bought it
for you, remember?

36:35.461 --> 36:39.434
It's a starter pistol, Ernie.

36:54.808 --> 36:57.057
It's a controversy.
That's what Al Sharpton does,

36:57.057 --> 36:59.104
and he does it well.
He doesn't just make noise.

36:59.104 --> 37:01.819
He lights and carries a torch
of racial controversy. –Mr Shore…

37:01.819 --> 37:03.790
Which you know,
which is why you're here.

37:03.790 --> 37:06.012
We need to put this one out, good people.

37:06.012 --> 37:08.567
Controversy is bad business for musicals.

37:08.567 --> 37:13.222
Your production will open and close
faster than you can say Trent Lott.

37:13.222 --> 37:17.110
I assume you've come with
a proposal. Let's have it.

37:18.782 --> 37:20.457
Sarah?

37:22.328 --> 37:26.698
♫ When I'm stuck with
a day that ♫ –Okay.

37:26.698 --> 37:31.428
We'll offer you the role
of understudy on weekends.

37:31.428 --> 37:35.728
–Plus three matinees a month.
–Done.

37:35.728 --> 37:37.434
Sarah?

37:52.787 --> 37:55.236
He pulled a gun on him.

37:55.236 --> 37:58.235
It only shot blanks, but, yeah.

37:58.235 --> 38:00.611
Drama's over.

38:03.006 --> 38:06.887
How's it feel being back?

38:06.887 --> 38:09.096
It's all right.

38:11.598 --> 38:13.246
Let me ask you a question.

38:13.246 --> 38:15.453
I'd appreciate an honest answer.

38:15.453 --> 38:17.342
Okay.

38:17.342 --> 38:21.044
Do you think I talk too fast?

38:24.306 --> 38:29.492
Sometimes you're a little brisk.

38:29.492 --> 38:32.984
I think it's good business practice,
not to mention good business ethics.

38:32.984 --> 38:35.574
We charge by the hour.
Our clients pay for the time
that we spend talking.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.638
As attorneys, we have an obligation
not to overbill our clients,

38:37.638 --> 38:41.467
so if I talk fast, 
it's just because I feel…

38:41.467 --> 38:44.196
ethically bound.

38:44.896 --> 38:46.679
He makes fun of me.

38:46.679 --> 38:48.031
I'm sorry?

38:48.031 --> 38:49.864
Shore.

38:50.124 --> 38:53.412
Thinks I'm a Ken doll.

38:54.477 --> 38:57.294
No, it's not right.
He calls me a Ken doll, while he…

38:57.294 --> 39:00.355
plays with your Barbie?

39:00.830 --> 39:02.643
Excuse me.

39:02.643 --> 39:03.631
Hi.

39:03.631 --> 39:05.008
Sharon.

39:05.008 --> 39:08.111
I just, I just came to say thank you,

39:08.111 --> 39:10.717
not that I agree with your tactics,

39:10.717 --> 39:16.683
but what this means to me and, 
and my children…

39:16.683 --> 39:23.706
Well, thank you so much.
I will never forget this.

39:33.333 --> 39:36.769
Remember that book,

39:36.769 --> 39:41.178
“one flew over
the cuckoo's nest”? –Yes.

39:44.157 --> 39:49.008
Is there a point, or did you just
want to know if I'd read it?

39:49.008 --> 39:53.978
There you go again, always
looking for a point.

39:55.788 --> 39:59.820
Matthew Calder just agreed to let his
wife move with their children.

39:59.820 --> 40:01.677
Fantastic.

40:02.182 --> 40:04.913
You got pictures of him with a hooker.
You blackmailed him.

40:04.913 --> 40:06.772
You make it sound unsavory.

40:06.772 --> 40:07.816
Listen to me.

40:07.816 --> 40:11.442
I know how you practice law.
I don't practice law like that.

40:11.442 --> 40:14.375
It was a rabbit.
Well, really a bunny.

40:14.375 --> 40:17.139
Marines don't like bunnies?

40:17.139 --> 40:19.453
You know, the only reason
I don't report you to the bar myself…

40:19.453 --> 40:22.146
is because Sharon might not be able
to go to New York with her children,

40:22.146 --> 40:28.430
which, shockingly, is more important
than our combined ethical egos.

40:28.430 --> 40:29.663
You know what, sport?

40:29.663 --> 40:32.184
You and I, now…

40:32.184 --> 40:35.559
officially have a relationship.

40:35.559 --> 40:36.922
Great.

40:36.922 --> 40:40.142
Perhaps we can get together
and do a couple of push-ups…

40:40.142 --> 40:42.574
Sport.

41:00.345 --> 41:02.597
Hooker rabbit.

41:02.597 --> 41:04.927
I love it.

41:05.433 --> 41:09.162
You know, you never answered
my question the other night.

41:09.162 --> 41:11.183
Which was?

41:11.183 --> 41:14.097
Are you scared?

41:19.302 --> 41:23.450
Only thing to be scared of,
son, is tomorrow.

41:23.450 --> 41:25.820
I don't live for tomorrow.

41:25.820 --> 41:28.713
Never saw the farther.

41:32.772 --> 41:34.909
Denny Crane…

41:34.909 --> 41:37.795
What was that?

41:38.726 --> 41:40.683
Nothing.

41:40.683 --> 41:44.012
Here's to no tomorrows.

41:45.305 --> 41:51.476
