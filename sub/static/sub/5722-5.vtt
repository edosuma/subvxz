<i>Previously on Homeland...</i>

00:09.547 --> 00:10.947
Your name's on a kill list.

00:11.015 --> 00:12.714
Saul put your name
on the list.

00:12.782 --> 00:15.784
- Saul?
- Now play fucking dead.

00:15.852 --> 00:18.620
You got to disappear.
This picture buys you time.

00:18.688 --> 00:21.223
Quinn, in the last two years,
I tried to find you.

00:21.291 --> 00:23.592
I never stopped thinking
about you.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.161
Well, how do I look?

00:25.228 --> 00:26.662
Korzy?

00:26.729 --> 00:29.898
What did you do
with those documents?

00:29.966 --> 00:31.367
We're going to be rich.

00:31.435 --> 00:32.935
My Russian friend paid big.

00:33.002 --> 00:35.737
I caught a diplomat
fucking Katja on tape.

00:35.805 --> 00:37.073
So,

00:37.140 --> 00:38.239
you have something for me.

00:41.110 --> 00:42.743
You don't know
what you are doing.

00:42.811 --> 00:44.912
One of my ambitions in life

00:44.980 --> 00:47.315
is to be a trusting person.

00:47.383 --> 00:49.817
I want to trust you.

00:49.885 --> 00:52.253
Unfortunately, I am cynical.

00:52.321 --> 00:54.155
- Take me to your drop.
- No, I'll handle it.

00:54.223 --> 00:55.723
<i>You are telling me</i>

00:55.791 --> 00:58.159
more than I've ever
trusted anyone

00:58.227 --> 00:59.760
is trying to kill me.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.536
If you had a plan
to replace Assad,

01:09.605 --> 01:12.106
we understand that it would be
with General Youssef.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.642
You have a loyal following
among the high-ranking officers.

01:14.710 --> 01:17.444
We believe they will support you
to lead your country.

01:17.512 --> 01:18.813

Mm-hmm, yeah.

03:19.062 --> 03:20.996
I don't know.

03:21.064 --> 03:22.565
I'm trying.

03:22.633 --> 03:24.434
Yeah.

03:24.501 --> 03:27.269
The Swiss Federal Police
are ten minutes out.

03:27.338 --> 03:28.871
We kept them away
as long as we could.

03:28.939 --> 03:30.372
How much do they know?

03:30.440 --> 03:31.506
It was
an intelligence operation.

03:31.574 --> 03:32.641
There was an accident.

03:32.709 --> 03:34.009
What about who was on the plane?

03:34.077 --> 03:35.177
Not yet.

03:35.212 --> 03:38.347
Well, we're gonna
have to tell them sometime.

03:38.414 --> 03:40.149
My feeling is,
they'll be patient.

03:40.217 --> 03:43.085
We have kept them in the loop.

03:43.153 --> 03:44.854
At least nominally.

03:44.921 --> 03:47.489
Frankly my main concern
is what went down here.

03:47.557 --> 03:48.958
You have a working theory?

03:49.025 --> 03:50.625
Somebody betrayed us.

03:50.693 --> 03:52.995
You think?

03:53.063 --> 03:54.696
I have every member
of the medical team

03:54.764 --> 03:56.197
who operated on General
Youssef's daughter

03:56.265 --> 03:57.699
in an interrogation room
right now.

03:57.767 --> 04:00.034
What if the breach
was back in Berlin,

04:00.102 --> 04:01.470
or at Langley?

04:01.537 --> 04:03.004
I'm not going there yet.

04:03.072 --> 04:04.740
Let's hope to hell
you don't have to.

04:04.807 --> 04:06.842
Give us a minute.

04:36.037 --> 04:37.471
Scheisse.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.213
Astrid.

04:47.282 --> 04:48.882
It's me.

04:48.950 --> 04:51.151
Carrie Mathison.

04:52.453 --> 04:54.021
Nice wig.

04:54.088 --> 04:55.555
Very retro.

04:55.623 --> 04:57.124
You look like one
of the Baader-Meinhof gang.

04:57.191 --> 04:58.458
Do you mind if we talk
in the car?

04:58.526 --> 05:00.193
A little paranoid, are we?

05:00.261 --> 05:01.728
Please.

05:01.796 --> 05:04.597
I've, I've got no one else
to turn to.

05:04.665 --> 05:06.199
What about your former employer?

05:06.267 --> 05:07.935
They've been looking
for you anyway--

05:08.002 --> 05:10.203
I imagine to discuss your
recent adventures in Lebanon.

05:10.271 --> 05:11.604
I don't know
who I can trust there.

05:11.672 --> 05:12.972
But you trust me.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.241
Peter Quinn does.

05:15.309 --> 05:17.243
Be my guest.

05:30.858 --> 05:32.091
I need your help.

05:32.159 --> 05:34.293
Yeah?

05:34.361 --> 05:38.364
Well, I'm not sure slashing
my tire is the best way to ask.

05:41.101 --> 05:43.469
Do you know who this man is?

05:43.536 --> 05:46.138
Was.

05:46.206 --> 05:47.639
Well, yes.

05:47.707 --> 05:49.808
How did he get dead?

05:49.876 --> 05:51.377
That's a long story.

05:51.445 --> 05:53.245
Does it look like I'm in a rush?

05:53.313 --> 05:54.813
This is not a joke.

05:54.881 --> 05:56.648
No one can know about this.

05:56.716 --> 05:58.917
I am literally putting
my life in your hands.

06:02.856 --> 06:04.957
The assassination attempt
in Lebanon,

06:05.025 --> 06:07.026
During was not the target,
I was.

06:07.094 --> 06:09.095
And you know this, how?

06:09.162 --> 06:10.696
That's not important.

06:10.763 --> 06:12.431
What's important
is that the people

06:12.499 --> 06:14.833
who targeted me think I'm dead,
but who knows how long

06:14.901 --> 06:16.335
before they realize
that's not true?

06:16.403 --> 06:18.003
Who are "they"?

06:18.070 --> 06:20.338
It's unclear.
Whoever they are,

06:20.406 --> 06:22.641
they're connected to this man.

06:23.910 --> 06:25.677
I don't recognize him.

06:25.745 --> 06:27.312
He tried to kill Quinn.

06:29.482 --> 06:31.884
Why doesn't that surprise me?

06:33.586 --> 06:36.087
What's that supposed to mean?

06:36.255 --> 06:38.590
Peter does his own legwork.
Always.

06:38.658 --> 06:41.226
You wouldn't be here unless
he got himself hurt somehow.

06:41.293 --> 06:43.461
Is he okay?

06:44.964 --> 06:46.898
He'll live.

06:48.167 --> 06:49.701
I want to see him.

06:49.769 --> 06:52.703
Now is not a good time.

06:57.643 --> 06:58.776
Wait.

06:58.844 --> 07:01.379
Give me the picture.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.915
I'll see what I can find out.

07:04.983 --> 07:07.152
Thanks.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.586
I'm not doing this for you.

07:08.654 --> 07:11.922
Yeah, I think
we're clear on that.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.625
No one can know
that you've seen me.

07:13.692 --> 07:15.627
- No one.
- You said.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.033
He rises.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.135
You were gone a long time.

07:59.204 --> 08:01.638
Well, apparently Astrid
likes to sleep in.

08:01.706 --> 08:03.106
I waited for almost an hour.

08:03.174 --> 08:05.275
Was she able to ID our guy?

08:05.343 --> 08:06.710
Not off the top
of her head.

08:06.777 --> 08:07.977
But she said she'd do
some looking.

08:08.045 --> 08:09.179
For your sake.

08:09.247 --> 08:11.315
She likes me--
what can I say?

08:11.382 --> 08:13.917
Her one redeeming quality,
as far as I can tell.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.421
Jesus, Quinn, you're burning up.

08:18.488 --> 08:20.189
I'm fine.

08:20.257 --> 08:21.591
No, you are not.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.404
Let me see.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.405
- No.
- Let me see!

08:39.942 --> 08:42.244
That does not look good.

08:42.311 --> 08:43.878
I'm first-stage septic.

08:43.946 --> 08:46.881
Fuck me.

08:46.949 --> 08:48.216
Tell me what to do.

08:49.885 --> 08:51.786
How do you feel
about armed robbery?

08:51.854 --> 08:53.221
There's an emergency room

08:53.289 --> 08:54.556
about a mile down the street

08:54.624 --> 08:55.990
on Ritterstrae.

08:58.127 --> 08:59.794
What're you doing?

08:59.862 --> 09:01.763
What I should've done
last night,

09:01.830 --> 09:02.964
calling Jonas.

09:03.031 --> 09:05.800
His sister's a doctor.

09:59.886 --> 10:01.187
Where have you been?

10:01.254 --> 10:03.523
Katja's dead.

10:03.590 --> 10:04.957
Yeah, I know.

10:05.025 --> 10:06.292
It's horrible.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.861
The police were here.

10:08.929 --> 10:10.630
They wanted to talk to Korzenik.

10:11.898 --> 10:13.366
Has he been in today?

10:13.434 --> 10:15.201
No.

10:15.268 --> 10:17.402
Shit.

10:17.470 --> 10:19.972
Why?

10:20.040 --> 10:21.473
You think he killed her?

10:21.541 --> 10:23.575
Who, Korzenik?

10:23.643 --> 10:25.044
Of course not.

10:26.847 --> 10:29.882
Look, Katja had a regular

10:29.950 --> 10:31.851
who worked
at the Russian embassy.

10:35.455 --> 10:37.556
Do you know who he is?

10:37.623 --> 10:39.391
Boris.

10:39.459 --> 10:42.794
Not his real name, probably.

10:42.863 --> 10:46.164
Would you recognize him
if you saw him again?

10:46.232 --> 10:47.966
Yeah.

10:48.033 --> 10:49.868
A real pig.

10:49.935 --> 10:52.036
Come with me.

11:16.827 --> 11:19.729
When was the last time
he was here?

11:20.999 --> 11:22.766
Four days ago, I think.

11:50.260 --> 11:52.094
There!

12:09.412 --> 12:10.946
That's him?

12:11.013 --> 12:11.846
You sure?

12:11.914 --> 12:13.648
Yeah.

12:21.657 --> 12:22.790
Put it high enough.

12:22.858 --> 12:24.960
It has to cover everything.

12:26.828 --> 12:28.262
I don't understand.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.230
Anything they see--
even the paint on the wall--

12:30.298 --> 12:31.598
they'll use it to
try to find me.

12:31.666 --> 12:34.468
I meant, if this
is so dangerous,

12:34.535 --> 12:37.104
I don't understand why
you're doing it at all.

12:38.373 --> 12:40.574
I owe it to Katja
and Korzy.

12:55.655 --> 12:57.790
Hello, citizens of the world.

12:57.858 --> 13:00.126
I'm Gabe H. Coud.

13:00.194 --> 13:02.928
The following video
shows a man--

13:02.997 --> 13:04.797
a pig--

13:04.865 --> 13:07.266
who works at the Russian embassy
in Berlin, Germany,

13:07.334 --> 13:10.803
who murdered Katja Keller,
an innocent person,

13:10.871 --> 13:14.207
and who disappeared
her partner Armand Korzenik.

13:14.274 --> 13:17.176
This is a call to arms.

13:17.244 --> 13:19.512
Meeting place
is the Russian embassy

13:19.579 --> 13:23.081
tomorrow at noon
to demand answers.

13:24.617 --> 13:26.584
It is only when
our voices are united

13:26.652 --> 13:30.155
that we become
too loud to ignore.

13:38.597 --> 13:40.532
How was that?

13:40.599 --> 13:42.934
Good.

13:44.937 --> 13:47.039
Quinn?

13:47.106 --> 13:49.474
Quinn?

14:07.159 --> 14:09.093
Come in, quickly.

14:09.161 --> 14:10.894
You don't look hurt.

14:10.962 --> 14:12.163
You said you were hurt.

14:12.230 --> 14:15.165
Please!
It's not safe out there.

14:15.232 --> 14:17.267
You said this was for you.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.036
Well, it's not.

14:19.103 --> 14:21.038
Hey!

14:21.105 --> 14:22.573
Last time I saw you,

14:22.640 --> 14:25.042
you were running into the woods
with a rifle.

14:25.109 --> 14:27.310
Screaming about assassins
and-and avenging angels

14:27.378 --> 14:28.645
and then...

14:28.713 --> 14:30.981
nothing.
Three days, nothing.

14:31.049 --> 14:32.649
And then you call
and tell me you're injured.

14:32.717 --> 14:34.417
Seriously injured.
What the fuck, Carrie?

14:34.485 --> 14:36.553
- You're right.
- On top of everything else,

14:36.621 --> 14:37.921
I'm putting my sister's
medical license

14:37.989 --> 14:39.422
- at risk here.
- Okay.

14:39.490 --> 14:41.592
There is a guy in the next room.
He's been shot.

14:41.659 --> 14:42.826
If we don't get an IV
into him now,

14:42.894 --> 14:43.993
he's not gonna make it.

14:44.061 --> 14:44.994
Who is he?

14:45.062 --> 14:46.862
He's a friend.

14:46.930 --> 14:48.230
He's a colleague, okay?

14:48.298 --> 14:49.498
I'll-I'll explain later.

14:49.566 --> 14:50.700
I promise.

14:50.767 --> 14:53.268
Why should I do
anything for you?

14:53.336 --> 14:56.906
I don't know.

14:59.309 --> 15:01.944
You have the antibiotics?

15:20.230 --> 15:21.463
Wash your hands.

15:21.531 --> 15:22.664
I need your help.

15:29.038 --> 15:32.040
You've hardly said ten words
since we left Geneva.

15:32.108 --> 15:35.110
Still in shock, I guess.

15:35.177 --> 15:37.879
It's shocking.

15:37.947 --> 15:41.549
I actually convinced myself
we were gonna change the world.

15:41.617 --> 15:43.918
Yeah.

15:45.454 --> 15:47.388
Wasn't the Syrians, though.

15:47.456 --> 15:48.556
No?

15:48.624 --> 15:50.424
How do you figure?

15:50.492 --> 15:52.393
If the Mukhabarat
had even a whiff of this,

15:52.461 --> 15:55.229
that plane never would've gotten
off the ground in Damascus.

15:55.297 --> 15:56.497
Who then?

15:56.565 --> 15:57.832
The Iranians?

15:57.900 --> 15:59.300
The Russians?

15:59.368 --> 16:01.001
Someone who had a vested
interest in keeping Assad

16:01.069 --> 16:02.436
in the presidential palace,

16:02.504 --> 16:04.805
that's for sure.

16:04.873 --> 16:08.209
Or keeping
General Youssef out of it.

16:08.277 --> 16:10.444
What do you mean?

16:10.512 --> 16:12.880
Mossad.

16:12.947 --> 16:14.782
They're hardly fans
of the general.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.984
And didn't Etai send up
a flare the other night?

16:17.052 --> 16:18.786
He did.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.054
So?

16:21.690 --> 16:22.956
I don't buy it.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.325
Why not?

16:24.393 --> 16:27.360
The simple answer is
usually the correct one.

16:27.428 --> 16:29.429
Nothing simple about Israel

16:29.497 --> 16:31.931
sabotaging one
of our operations.

16:40.241 --> 16:41.874
What?

16:41.942 --> 16:43.677
Aren't we going to your place?

16:43.744 --> 16:45.812
I won't be able
to sleep tonight.

16:45.879 --> 16:49.449
I thought I'd go in and get a
head start on the OpSec review.

17:03.963 --> 17:07.065
Don't forget your bag.

17:29.121 --> 17:31.055
What if he doesn't get better?

17:32.758 --> 17:34.392
He will.

17:34.460 --> 17:35.826
What if
he doesn't?

17:35.894 --> 17:39.196
Will you take him
to the hospital then?

17:39.265 --> 17:42.967
Would your sister come
and examine him first?

17:45.337 --> 17:47.505
She might, if I ask her to,

17:47.573 --> 17:50.174
but I won't involve my
family in this anymore.

17:52.844 --> 17:54.678
Okay.

17:54.746 --> 17:56.680
I get that.

17:59.584 --> 18:03.086
I won't be involved
anymore, either.

18:08.626 --> 18:11.194
You've done
more than enough, Jonas.

18:11.262 --> 18:12.896
Thank you.

18:12.963 --> 18:15.766
I mean that.

18:15.833 --> 18:19.068
No one should have
to live like this.

18:19.136 --> 18:21.270
I just said
you don't have to.

18:21.338 --> 18:23.939
I'm not talking about me.

18:24.007 --> 18:25.741
Well, I don't have a choice.

18:25.809 --> 18:26.975
Yes, you do.

18:27.043 --> 18:28.977
Well, I wish that were true.

18:33.149 --> 18:36.919
This is insane.

18:36.986 --> 18:39.922
Assassination attempts,
gun battles in the street.

18:39.989 --> 18:42.090
You've got to find
a way to stop all this, Carrie.

18:42.158 --> 18:46.028
This...

18:51.767 --> 18:54.236
I don't want to lose you.

18:54.304 --> 18:57.039
I can't lose you.

18:57.106 --> 18:59.041
I thought I had.

19:41.816 --> 19:44.986
Allison.

19:45.053 --> 19:48.022
I was beginning to think
you weren't coming.

19:48.090 --> 19:49.656
Yet here I am.

19:49.724 --> 19:51.993
How are you?

19:52.060 --> 19:53.660
- How am I?
- Mm-hmm.

19:53.728 --> 19:55.462
How the hell
do you think I am?

19:55.530 --> 19:58.232
Oh, I think you should be
satisfied.

19:58.300 --> 19:59.700
Look.

19:59.768 --> 20:01.235
All went as planned.

20:01.303 --> 20:02.369
Ticktock-- all is good.

20:02.436 --> 20:04.037
It did not.

20:04.105 --> 20:05.738
How so?

20:05.806 --> 20:09.709
I got a call from Vasily
on the tarmac.

20:09.777 --> 20:12.979
Except it wasn't Vasily
on the other end of the line.

20:15.149 --> 20:16.883
I was afraid of that.

20:16.951 --> 20:18.484
What do you mean
you were afraid of that?

20:18.552 --> 20:19.585
Hmm, no. Not your problem.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.487
Don't worry about it.

20:21.555 --> 20:24.291
Not my problem somebody got
a hold of Vasily's cell phone?

20:24.358 --> 20:27.060
I have to assume
it was Saul Berenson's hit man.

20:27.128 --> 20:29.062
Exactly.

20:29.130 --> 20:31.298
And-and what happens
when he and Saul compare notes

20:31.365 --> 20:33.300
and realize
that it was me who put

20:33.367 --> 20:35.302
Carrie Mathison's name
in that kill box.

20:35.369 --> 20:37.304
A conversation like this
might lead to the SVR.

20:37.371 --> 20:38.738
Might even lead to me.

20:38.806 --> 20:41.474
It will never, ever lead to you.

20:41.542 --> 20:43.209
Okay?

20:43.277 --> 20:45.478
As I told you, my problem.

20:45.546 --> 20:47.647
You better be fucking right.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.416
You better fucking relax,
Allison.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.393
This was your problem.

21:05.198 --> 21:06.631
As you can see,

21:06.699 --> 21:08.800
that problem
was solved.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.005
Jesus Christ.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.556
My nerves are shot.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.959
Hey.

21:39.932 --> 21:43.668
Just a little farther
now, okay?

21:43.736 --> 21:46.771
Almost there.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.941
Easy for you to say.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.778
Don't be scared of him.

21:53.846 --> 21:57.115
Who-- Dar Adal?

21:57.182 --> 21:59.283
He's a pussycat.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.986
We've put out the milk.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.721
He will lap it up, believe me.

22:02.788 --> 22:04.489
It's gonna take
a lot more than that

22:04.557 --> 22:05.824
to turn him against Saul.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.626
Wait and see.

22:07.693 --> 22:10.194
Saul's weakness is Israel.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.998
Dar Adal knows it.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.532
So when he comes to you--

22:14.599 --> 22:16.934
and he will come...

22:19.303 --> 22:22.506
play hard to get.

22:22.574 --> 22:25.676
Then go to Saul
with the passenger manifest.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.678
Okay?

22:29.948 --> 22:32.282
Okay.

22:37.455 --> 22:38.722
Hey.

22:40.191 --> 22:42.125
Ciao, cacao.

22:45.830 --> 22:47.531
Ivan, please?

22:51.670 --> 22:54.504
Stay with me a little longer.

22:56.840 --> 22:59.609
Sure.

23:27.905 --> 23:29.405
_

23:49.391 --> 23:50.659
Come in.

23:53.696 --> 23:57.232
I thought you were
still in Geneva.

23:57.299 --> 23:59.167
Something's come up.

23:59.235 --> 24:01.169
Tell me.

24:03.673 --> 24:05.406
Is Saul still
in the building?

24:05.474 --> 24:08.510
He put his head in
about five minutes ago.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.846
The two of you had dinner

24:11.913 --> 24:14.315
at Etai Luskin's home
on Friday night.

24:14.383 --> 24:15.850
We did.
It was a Passover Seder.

24:15.917 --> 24:17.685
Saul invited me.

24:17.753 --> 24:19.187
As his guest?

24:19.255 --> 24:21.256
Yes.

24:21.323 --> 24:23.458
Your contact report
said the conversation

24:23.526 --> 24:25.126
was casual, friendly?

24:25.194 --> 24:27.795
It was.

24:27.863 --> 24:29.464
The bomb that took down

24:29.532 --> 24:31.666
General Youssef's plane
was magnetic.

24:31.733 --> 24:35.135
You're kidding.

24:35.203 --> 24:37.937
Set to go off
at 20,000 feet.

24:38.005 --> 24:41.074
There was
a malfunction apparently.

24:41.142 --> 24:44.511
We were lucky to recover it
is what you're saying.

24:44.579 --> 24:47.581
Very.

24:47.649 --> 24:50.116
The techs claim it's
virtually identical

24:50.185 --> 24:52.286
to what Israel's using

24:52.353 --> 24:54.954
against Iran's
nuclear scientists.

24:55.022 --> 24:58.192
I assume you know
that Saul and Etai go way back.

24:58.259 --> 25:00.294
Africa, wasn't it?

25:00.361 --> 25:01.895
Nairobi.

25:01.962 --> 25:04.331
They were young
and idealistic together.

25:04.399 --> 25:07.067
A bond was formed.

25:07.134 --> 25:09.202
Surely you don't
think Saul...

25:09.269 --> 25:11.537
I don't know
what to think!

25:15.042 --> 25:17.310
But it's not something
we can ignore.

25:18.612 --> 25:20.814
Put a team on him.

25:20.881 --> 25:22.982
Just to be clear, sir.

25:23.050 --> 25:25.085
On Etai, right?

25:25.152 --> 25:26.186
No, on Saul.

25:26.253 --> 25:27.687
Eyes, ears, the works.

25:27.755 --> 25:29.288
I want to know
who he's meeting with

25:29.356 --> 25:31.357
and what he's saying to them.

26:30.749 --> 26:32.215
What's all this?

26:32.284 --> 26:35.218
Just trying to reconstruct
a list of anyone at Langley

26:35.287 --> 26:36.953
who had operational clearance.

26:37.021 --> 26:40.291
You should take a look
at this first.

26:40.358 --> 26:42.293
What is it?

26:42.360 --> 26:46.697
Passenger manifest for
Lufthansa Flight 667

26:46.765 --> 26:50.100
leaving from Berlin to
Geneva on Saturday morning.

26:50.168 --> 26:52.102
Saturday,

26:52.170 --> 26:53.937
as in the day
before yesterday?

26:54.005 --> 26:55.038
That's correct.

26:55.106 --> 26:57.040
Third page.

26:57.108 --> 26:59.876
Seat 23-C, the
highlighted name.

27:03.314 --> 27:06.082
"Petrich, Michael.

27:06.150 --> 27:09.953
Professor
of applied sciences...

27:10.021 --> 27:11.955
at Beuth University."

27:16.027 --> 27:17.794
Do I know this man?

27:19.330 --> 27:21.264
I'm afraid so.

27:25.401 --> 27:28.337
CCTV from the
security line at Tegel.

27:37.347 --> 27:39.715
Etai.

27:44.254 --> 27:47.823
He was there, Saul,
in Switzerland,

27:47.891 --> 27:49.624
the day General Youssef's
plane went down.

27:49.692 --> 27:52.460
Petrich is one of his
many known covers.

27:56.565 --> 27:58.933
Tell me about it.

27:59.001 --> 28:01.002
Do we know
where he went?

28:01.070 --> 28:03.371
Or who he met with?

28:03.438 --> 28:06.607
I've only just found out
about the flight myself.

28:08.677 --> 28:10.011
Have you told Dar?

28:10.079 --> 28:11.980
No, I came to you first.

28:12.047 --> 28:13.982
Good.

28:14.049 --> 28:15.984
Keep it between us
for the time being.

28:16.051 --> 28:18.018
Okay.

28:18.086 --> 28:19.553
Where are you going?

28:33.049 --> 28:34.806
_

28:52.916 --> 28:53.932
_

28:54.024 --> 28:55.504
_

28:56.904 --> 28:59.388
_

28:59.487 --> 29:00.755
_

29:01.060 --> 29:02.482
_

29:04.984 --> 29:06.024
_

29:07.572 --> 29:09.982
_

29:10.568 --> 29:11.738
_

29:20.242 --> 29:21.790
_

29:21.879 --> 29:23.203
_

29:23.420 --> 29:24.175
Ja.

29:25.065 --> 29:27.186
_

29:27.257 --> 29:29.691
_

29:31.563 --> 29:32.773
_

29:35.332 --> 29:36.590
_

29:37.134 --> 29:38.142
_

29:38.263 --> 29:39.363
_

29:40.970 --> 29:41.839
_

29:44.567 --> 29:45.854
_

29:46.414 --> 29:48.193
_

29:51.548 --> 29:53.253
_

29:53.354 --> 29:54.974
_

30:14.211 --> 30:15.694
_

30:16.289 --> 30:16.962
_

30:20.784 --> 30:23.267
_

30:24.017 --> 30:25.079
_

30:35.452 --> 30:38.388
...where hundreds of people
have gathered in response

30:38.455 --> 30:42.325
to a video posted
anonymously online,

30:42.393 --> 30:45.327
accusing
a Russian consular official

30:45.395 --> 30:48.030
of murder
and possible kidnapping.

30:48.097 --> 30:50.132
- In fact, the embassy Web site...
- Carrie, have you seen this?

30:50.199 --> 30:52.001
You should see this.

30:52.068 --> 30:54.003
...was shut down for almost
two hours this morning,

30:54.070 --> 30:56.005
replaced by footage
of the alleged official

30:56.072 --> 30:59.408
having sex with two prostitutes.

30:59.475 --> 31:03.445
The authenticity of the footage
cannot be confirmed,

31:03.513 --> 31:06.549
but the hack on the Web site
went on to include

31:06.616 --> 31:09.451
allegations that the SVR,

31:09.519 --> 31:12.454
Russia's external
intelligence agency,

31:12.522 --> 31:15.557
killed a young woman named
Katja Keller

31:15.624 --> 31:19.428
in an attempt to buy
classified CIA documents.

31:19.495 --> 31:20.462
What does this mean?

31:20.530 --> 31:22.297
Give me a minute.

31:22.365 --> 31:25.233
The Russian diplomatic mission
in Germany has released...

31:29.472 --> 31:30.337
Hello?

31:30.405 --> 31:31.972
It's me.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.141
What the hell's happening
at the Russian embassy?

31:34.209 --> 31:35.976
You heard about that already?

31:36.044 --> 31:37.911
Yeah, it's all over
the Internet.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.547
They keep mentioning classified
documents-- are they

31:39.614 --> 31:41.082
the same ones Laura Sutton was
writing about last week?

31:41.149 --> 31:42.516
One would assume.

31:42.584 --> 31:44.418
He said as much on the video.

31:44.486 --> 31:47.455
- Who did? - The hacker who crashed
the embassy Web site.

31:47.522 --> 31:50.857
The same guy who
cyber-penetrated Berlin Station?

31:50.925 --> 31:53.126
Apparently.

31:53.194 --> 31:54.962
Uh, what about
the photo I gave you?

31:55.029 --> 31:56.296
Any luck there?

31:56.363 --> 31:59.199
Actually, yes.

31:59.266 --> 32:02.035
Name is Vasily Kovas.

32:02.103 --> 32:03.436
Chechen born.

32:03.504 --> 32:04.871
Formerly a contract killer

32:04.939 --> 32:07.240
for Russian organized crime
here in Berlin.

32:07.308 --> 32:09.710
The Tambovskaya?

32:09.777 --> 32:12.445
Among others.

32:12.513 --> 32:13.480
"Formerly," you said.

32:13.547 --> 32:15.280
Before he went out on his own.

32:15.348 --> 32:17.783
Any way to connect him to what's
going on at the embassy?

32:20.087 --> 32:22.021
Well, I can think
of at least one way.

32:22.089 --> 32:23.856
What's that?

32:23.924 --> 32:27.459
He's done a bunch of freelance
jobs for the SVR lately.

32:29.096 --> 32:30.395
What?

32:30.463 --> 32:32.397
Yeah.

32:32.465 --> 32:34.100
Real tough guy.

32:36.369 --> 32:39.138
Astrid, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

32:39.205 --> 32:40.305
What is it?

32:40.373 --> 32:41.440
What did she say?

32:41.508 --> 32:42.941
God, I've been such a fool.

32:43.009 --> 32:44.909
It's been staring me
right in the face.

32:44.977 --> 32:46.745
What has?

32:46.812 --> 32:48.180
Quinn needs to hear this, too.

32:48.248 --> 32:50.081
Did you get a name?

32:50.150 --> 32:52.584
Got more than that.

32:52.652 --> 32:54.953
That guy who tried to kill you
works for Russian intelligence.

32:55.021 --> 32:56.955
That's who got in the middle
of your operation.

32:57.023 --> 32:59.990
Saul didn't put my name in that
kill box, the Russians did.

33:00.058 --> 33:02.260
- Why?
- Well, think about it.

33:02.327 --> 33:04.662
The stuff Laura Sutton published
last week was only part

33:04.729 --> 33:06.264
of what was hacked
out of Berlin Station.

33:06.331 --> 33:07.831
So there was something in
the additional documents

33:07.899 --> 33:09.267
the SVR didn't want you to see.

33:09.334 --> 33:11.636
Correct.

33:11.703 --> 33:14.539
- Uh, what are you doing? - If you're going
back out there again, I'm coming with.

33:14.606 --> 33:15.939
No, hey, hey, hey,
Quinn, lie back.

33:16.007 --> 33:17.408
- It's too dangerous.
- It's not.

33:17.476 --> 33:19.143
No one's after me
at the moment thanks to you.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.479
Where's Laura?

33:22.547 --> 33:24.481
Last I heard, she was
reaching out to her source.

33:24.549 --> 33:25.882
The hacker?

33:25.949 --> 33:27.984
Yes. Not sure if
they ever connected.

33:28.052 --> 33:31.488
Well, I need to see those
documents, whoever's got them.

33:33.891 --> 33:36.259
Let me call her.

33:41.432 --> 33:43.200
Hey, you gonna be all right?

33:43.267 --> 33:46.168
I'd be better if you'd get
the hell out of Dodge.

33:46.236 --> 33:48.604
I can't do that, not now.

33:48.672 --> 33:50.706
We'll talk about it
when I get back, okay?

33:55.612 --> 33:58.314
Okay, yeah, <i>danke.</i>

33:58.381 --> 34:00.749
The office says she's
at the Russian embassy

34:00.817 --> 34:02.251
covering the
demonstration there.

34:02.319 --> 34:05.153
I'm gonna need you
to look after him for a while.

34:05.222 --> 34:07.089
- Carrie, listen to me.
- I'll just be a few hours.

34:07.156 --> 34:09.524
It's the last thing I will
ask you to do, I swear.

34:41.456 --> 34:43.822
Private plane went down
near Geneva this weekend.

34:43.891 --> 34:45.225
I assume you're aware.

34:45.293 --> 34:46.659
I heard rumors.

34:46.728 --> 34:48.061
What about?

34:48.129 --> 34:51.498
A near-epic operation
gone south.

34:51.565 --> 34:55.900
Family members, not just
principals, among the dead.

34:55.969 --> 34:58.804
The matter we discussed
at the Seder the other night.

34:58.872 --> 35:00.973
- Hmm?
- I need to know the source of your intel.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.976
You know, a man
with a paranoid cast of mind

35:04.043 --> 35:06.145
might think that you think
we had something to do

35:06.212 --> 35:07.980
with bringing down that plane.

35:08.047 --> 35:11.049
Maybe your source was shopping
his wares to someone else.

35:11.117 --> 35:14.052
Maybe you should grow a pair
of tits and go fuck yourself.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.489
Let's talk about where you
were the day before yesterday.

35:16.556 --> 35:20.225
- You mean Saturday?
- Yes, I mean Saturday.

35:20.293 --> 35:22.227
Yeah, but if you already know,
what's the point of asking?

35:22.295 --> 35:23.428
Well, what were you
doing in Switzerland?

35:23.496 --> 35:24.429
I can't tell you.

35:27.867 --> 35:31.303
I was recruiting a
potential asset, okay?

35:31.370 --> 35:32.537
Who?

35:32.605 --> 35:34.873
That I won't tell you.

35:34.941 --> 35:36.875
Anyway, it was
a waste of time.

35:36.943 --> 35:39.543
- He never showed.
- So it's just a coincidence you were there?

35:39.611 --> 35:41.112
Yeah, a troubling
one, I admit.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.546
Troubling?

35:42.614 --> 35:43.948
The night before you were
giving me an earful

35:44.016 --> 35:45.449
about regime change
in Damascus.

35:45.517 --> 35:46.884
Another coincidence,
I'm afraid.

35:46.952 --> 35:48.886
I'm sure you can see
how this looks

35:48.954 --> 35:49.987
from where I'm standing.

35:50.055 --> 35:52.423
We didn't do it, Saul.

35:52.490 --> 35:55.827
We didn't murder the
general you never met

35:55.894 --> 35:58.796
to discuss the coup that
you weren't planning.

35:58.863 --> 36:00.663
Well, somebody did.

36:07.538 --> 36:09.306
Just as you cannot be
a little pregnant,

36:09.373 --> 36:11.641
so you cannot be a
little totalitarian.

36:11.709 --> 36:13.476
Our entire youth is being
monitored, everything we do,

36:13.544 --> 36:15.111
and we don't know
what that might mean,

36:15.179 --> 36:16.479
how it might be used against us.

36:16.547 --> 36:17.881
So what are you guys?

36:17.949 --> 36:21.217
Chaos Chess Club,
Pirate Party, Tactical Tech?

36:21.284 --> 36:22.318
None of the above.

36:22.386 --> 36:23.720
Do you consider Gabe H. Coud

36:23.787 --> 36:25.621
to be the most dangerous
man in cyberspace?

36:25.689 --> 36:27.022
He is now.

36:27.090 --> 36:28.023
Is he here?

36:28.091 --> 36:29.859
- Do you know?
- Of course.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.260
- Where?
- Right here.

36:31.328 --> 36:32.261
I'm him.

36:33.731 --> 36:35.130
- So am I.
- Me, too.

36:35.198 --> 36:36.833
Je suis Gabe H. Coud.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.700
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!

36:38.768 --> 36:42.136
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!

36:42.204 --> 36:45.774
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!

36:45.842 --> 36:47.041
Je suis Gabe H. Coud...

37:08.263 --> 37:09.630
Do you guys speak English?

37:09.698 --> 37:10.831
I do.

37:10.899 --> 37:12.332
I'll give you 20
euro for your mask.

37:12.401 --> 37:13.367
Make it 50.

37:13.435 --> 37:14.769
Done.

37:19.407 --> 37:20.339
Thanks.

37:31.619 --> 37:35.554
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!

37:35.622 --> 37:39.191
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!
Je suis Gabe H. Coud...

37:48.568 --> 37:50.269
Hey!

37:50.337 --> 37:52.271
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!

37:52.339 --> 37:54.273
Je suis
Gabe H. Coud!

37:54.341 --> 37:57.175
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!
Je suis Gabe H. Coud!

37:57.243 --> 37:59.912
Je suis
Gabe H. Coud!

37:59.979 --> 38:01.947
Je suis Gabe H. Coud...

38:12.592 --> 38:13.925
Hello?

38:13.992 --> 38:15.793
Laura, it's me, Carrie.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.227
Carrie? What the hell?

38:17.295 --> 38:19.797
You should probably
get out of here.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.600
- Police are about to move in and break up
the protest. - How do you know that?

38:22.668 --> 38:25.436
Because I'm watching them
get ready right now.

38:25.504 --> 38:26.838
I really need to talk to you.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.272
What about?

38:28.340 --> 38:29.740
Meet me at the
Ostbahnhof station.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.141
Lose your cameraman.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.176
Walk, don't run.

38:56.232 --> 38:58.333
- This happened when?
- About 45 minutes ago.

38:58.401 --> 39:00.870
I take it we didn't
have ears on it?

39:00.937 --> 39:02.538
No way to get a parabolic
mic close enough.

39:02.606 --> 39:03.906
Plus the water feature
in the garden.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.307
I'll be damned.

39:08.478 --> 39:11.213
It's hardly
a smoking gun, sir.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.915
Excuse me?

39:12.983 --> 39:15.850
I mean, there's probably
another explanation.

39:15.918 --> 39:18.653
This could be about something
completely unrelated.

39:51.419 --> 39:53.086
You don't know me. Sit down
and take out your phone.

39:53.154 --> 39:54.254
What's going on?

39:54.321 --> 39:55.689
Take out your phone

39:55.757 --> 39:57.190
and make like
you're talking on it.

40:03.798 --> 40:06.232
Okay, good. Thanks for coming.

40:06.300 --> 40:08.101
Another phone trick,

40:08.169 --> 40:10.203
I'm gonna have
to remember these.

40:10.271 --> 40:12.405
Jonas told me you were looking
for your hacker friend.

40:12.473 --> 40:13.706
Did you ever track him down?

40:13.774 --> 40:15.808
Why?

40:15.876 --> 40:17.777
I need to see
the rest of the material

40:17.844 --> 40:19.479
he got from the CIA.

40:19.547 --> 40:21.481
- Not gonna happen.
- Laura, look,

40:21.549 --> 40:24.050
I know we're not best friends,
but you got to believe me,

40:24.118 --> 40:26.119
- we are on the same side here.
- You don't understand.

40:26.187 --> 40:27.954
People are dying because
of what's in those documents.

40:28.021 --> 40:29.155
Let me finish.

40:29.223 --> 40:31.156
I don't have them, Carrie.

40:31.224 --> 40:33.059
What?

40:33.126 --> 40:34.860
Numan doesn't either.

40:34.928 --> 40:36.361
Numan?

40:36.429 --> 40:38.230
Apparently a buddy of his
double-crossed him

40:38.298 --> 40:40.900
and sold them to someone
inside the Russian embassy.

40:40.968 --> 40:44.036
He's got to have
a backup somewhere.

40:44.104 --> 40:46.205
Unless he's a really good liar,
I don't think so.

40:46.272 --> 40:48.708
- Fuck.
- Hey.

40:48.775 --> 40:51.143
Hey.

40:53.946 --> 40:55.247
Can I make a suggestion?

40:58.485 --> 41:00.252
Numan didn't have the only copy.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.154
What do you mean?

41:02.222 --> 41:03.888
He downloaded
the shit, right?

41:03.956 --> 41:07.292
But it's not like he deleted it
from the server.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.361
The files are still
at the CIA someplace.

41:11.063 --> 41:13.098
Maybe you can get one
of your friends there...

41:13.166 --> 41:14.265
They are not my friends.

41:14.333 --> 41:15.600
Do you not get that?

41:15.667 --> 41:17.268
Jesus, I'm poison to them.

41:17.336 --> 41:19.270
Yeah?

41:19.338 --> 41:20.971
Well, it's not like you've got

41:21.039 --> 41:22.440
a ton of options right now.

41:27.179 --> 41:28.312
God, you're shaking.

41:28.380 --> 41:29.647
I'm just cold.

41:31.716 --> 41:33.751
Okay, come on.

41:33.818 --> 41:35.253
Don't.

41:40.024 --> 41:42.759
Jesus.

41:42.826 --> 41:43.860
I'm okay.

41:43.927 --> 41:45.595
No, you're not.

41:45.663 --> 41:47.164
You call an ambulance,

41:47.231 --> 41:49.032
you condemn her to death.

41:49.099 --> 41:50.634
I can't just sit here
and watch you die.

41:50.701 --> 41:52.202
Then fuck off somewhere else.

41:52.270 --> 41:53.637
That's not a choice, either.

41:53.704 --> 41:55.205
If I'm found like this

41:55.273 --> 41:57.140
in a hospital or in a morgue,

41:57.208 --> 41:59.475
Carrie will never be free.

42:01.844 --> 42:04.280
Oh, you people are
out of your fucking minds.

42:04.347 --> 42:05.847
You'd do the same
if you were me.

42:05.915 --> 42:08.284
- I would not.
- For her, you would.

42:08.351 --> 42:10.519
No. I would never put myself
in that situation.

42:12.322 --> 42:13.656
What? What's so goddamn funny?

42:13.723 --> 42:15.324
You're already
in that situation.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.261
Hello?

42:19.329 --> 42:21.530
Hello?

42:23.499 --> 42:25.233
Laura didn't have the documents.

42:25.301 --> 42:26.735
I'm gonna be a little longer
than I thought.

42:26.803 --> 42:28.203
How much longer?

42:28.270 --> 42:30.271
- A couple hours.
- That's not going to work.

42:30.339 --> 42:31.606
Your friend's
in really bad shape.

42:31.674 --> 42:33.341
Tell me.

42:33.409 --> 42:34.876
He lost a lot of blood.

42:34.944 --> 42:36.511
Jonas, you're gonna have
to call your sister.

42:36.579 --> 42:38.180
She's just going to say

42:38.247 --> 42:39.881
he needs to go
to the emergency room.

42:39.949 --> 42:41.950
You don't know that.

42:42.018 --> 42:43.185
Carrie, he is dying!

42:48.623 --> 42:49.690
Okay, then.

42:49.758 --> 42:51.058
Call an ambulance.

42:51.126 --> 42:52.326
- Do what you have to do.
- Ca-Carrie...

42:52.393 --> 42:53.894
Damn it.

43:23.858 --> 43:25.792
Quinn!

44:25.082 --> 44:27.785
Hello. I need to get a
wake-up call at 6:15 AM.

46:24.832 --> 46:26.766
Go away.

46:29.003 --> 46:32.239
"Only God is permitted
to give life and to take life."

46:35.043 --> 46:36.977
I said,

46:37.045 --> 46:39.579
go away.

46:39.647 --> 46:41.214
I want.

46:41.282 --> 46:43.283
I cannot.

46:43.351 --> 46:44.783
God has sent me to help you.

46:46.954 --> 46:48.687
Un-fucking-believable.

46:48.755 --> 46:50.589
Un-fucking-believable.

46:56.997 --> 46:59.365
You are injured.

46:59.433 --> 47:02.234
Please, I will take you
to a hospital.

47:02.302 --> 47:04.236
No hospital.

47:18.585 --> 47:20.452
Just leave me the fuck alone.

49:01.518 --> 49:03.752
You're a runner now, huh?

49:03.820 --> 49:05.154
Yeah.
