WEBVTT

00:01.779 --> 00:03.145
(siren wailing in distance)

00:03.147 --> 00:04.862
GORMLEY: Both the FBI
and Homeland Security

00:04.863 --> 00:06.329
are saying the same thing
in different colors.

00:06.331 --> 00:08.798
Chatter has this
as the opening play

00:08.800 --> 00:11.029
in a planned chain of attacks
on our transpo hubs.

00:11.030 --> 00:13.120
They're saying the same thing in different
colors-- what's that mean?

00:13.121 --> 00:14.854
That their spitting contest
doesn't take a break,

00:14.856 --> 00:16.055
come hell or high water.

00:16.056 --> 00:17.356
Couldn't put out
a joint statement saying

00:17.358 --> 00:18.291
the sky is blue.

00:18.293 --> 00:20.259
- Emergency Management?
- The same.

00:20.261 --> 00:21.727
No one thinks this is a one-off.

00:21.729 --> 00:23.062
No one thinks or know one knows?

00:23.064 --> 00:24.096
Thinks, obviously.

00:24.098 --> 00:25.865
Okay. So what do <i>we</i> know?

00:25.867 --> 00:29.201
That the only casualty this time
was the suicide bomber himself.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.037
So, big silver lining.

00:31.039 --> 00:32.705
And that we got
his phone.

00:32.707 --> 00:34.941
He left it in a truck
after he stepped outside

00:34.943 --> 00:35.942
and blew himself up.

00:35.944 --> 00:37.109
Dump the phone.

00:37.111 --> 00:38.344
TARU's working on it.

00:39.647 --> 00:41.647
Well, they've either dumped
the phone or they haven't.

00:41.649 --> 00:42.848
Boss, it's the technology.

00:42.850 --> 00:44.922
- What, ours?
- No, the terrorist's phone.

00:44.923 --> 00:46.989
They make their bombs
on the cheap in the kitchen,

00:46.991 --> 00:48.257
but they spare no expense

00:48.259 --> 00:50.793
for the latest and greatest
in their tech.

00:50.795 --> 00:54.130
Chiefs of FDNY
and Port Authority

00:54.132 --> 00:57.467
and regional Homeland Security
and FBI are 20 minutes out.

00:57.469 --> 00:58.501
Out of where?

00:58.503 --> 01:00.436
Uh, from here,
for a joint press briefing.

01:00.438 --> 01:03.139
I want to push it
till we dump the phone.

01:03.141 --> 01:05.373
Boss, I wouldn't do that.
TARU can't get in.

01:05.376 --> 01:07.810
They can't get in?
It's a new operating system

01:07.812 --> 01:09.312
we don't have
a backdoor key to.

01:09.314 --> 01:10.980
Well, then, kick in
the front door.

01:10.982 --> 01:13.683
Boss, that would erase
all the data on the phone.

01:17.422 --> 01:19.889
Seriously?

01:20.792 --> 01:22.325
So, you have plans
tonight or what?

01:22.327 --> 01:23.326
Why?

01:23.328 --> 01:24.794
A bunch of us
are getting together.

01:24.796 --> 01:26.629
We're going for Trivia Night
at Ingram's Bar.

01:26.631 --> 01:28.364
I figured you could be
my ace in the hole.

01:28.366 --> 01:30.199
- (chuckles) Really?
- Yeah, I'm always bragging

01:30.201 --> 01:32.869
on you to Barry about how
you went to Harvard Law and all.

01:32.871 --> 01:34.036
Oh, is he gonna be there?

01:34.038 --> 01:35.671
Yeah.

01:35.673 --> 01:36.839
You know,

01:36.841 --> 01:38.975
you could always bring someone
yourself.

01:38.977 --> 01:41.210
I would, but I got a hot date.

01:41.212 --> 01:43.579
With my grandfather.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.548
Can't you get a rain check?

01:45.550 --> 01:46.983
We don't do rain checks
in my family.

01:46.985 --> 01:48.985
DISPATCHER:
12 David, you have a 10-68.

01:48.987 --> 01:50.553
In front
of St. Benjamin's Hospital.

01:50.555 --> 01:52.688
Female reports a missing person
at this location.

01:52.690 --> 01:54.290
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:54.292 --> 01:56.058
(siren wailing)

02:00.265 --> 02:01.764
Erin.

02:02.700 --> 02:03.666
You're looking well.

02:03.668 --> 02:05.001
You, too, Father.

02:05.003 --> 02:07.537
I didn't realize
anyone would be joining us.

02:07.539 --> 02:08.604
PRIEST: Right. I
don't know if you've

02:08.606 --> 02:10.306
ever been formally introduced
to John Romano.

02:10.308 --> 02:12.041
ERIN:
No, but I certainly

02:12.043 --> 02:13.042
know the name.

02:13.044 --> 02:14.343
Charmed.

02:14.345 --> 02:17.380
I can't tell you
how inappropriate this is,

02:17.382 --> 02:18.748
Father.
Mr. Romano's

02:18.750 --> 02:20.416
son is being tried by my office

02:20.418 --> 02:21.851
under the
Organized Crime

02:21.853 --> 02:23.286
Control Act.

02:23.288 --> 02:25.454
John is not his son.

02:25.456 --> 02:26.756
No, he's much slicker.

02:26.758 --> 02:29.025
He's been under investigation
for 20 years, at least?

02:29.027 --> 02:31.394
Without ever being convicted
of a felony.

02:31.396 --> 02:33.963
I'm a businessman, Ms. Reagan.

02:33.965 --> 02:34.997
It's true, Erin.

02:34.999 --> 02:36.065
John's been an important part

02:36.067 --> 02:37.600
of the church community
for years.

02:37.602 --> 02:38.668
He's the main support

02:38.670 --> 02:39.936
of our youth
program.

02:39.938 --> 02:41.971
I can't be seen with this man
outside of work.

02:45.476 --> 02:48.211
What if this could help you
with your work?

02:48.213 --> 02:49.946
Excuse me?

02:49.948 --> 02:52.081
What if I told you
I had information to offer

02:52.083 --> 02:54.317
about crimes
that are about to happen?

02:54.319 --> 02:56.285
I'd say you're trying
to compromise my office

02:56.287 --> 02:58.054
and trying to save your son.

02:59.057 --> 03:00.923
What's so wrong
with trying to help my boy?

03:00.925 --> 03:02.592
Isn't that what you do

03:02.594 --> 03:04.493
every day
at your office,

03:04.495 --> 03:07.163
cut deals so you can catch
the bigger fish?

03:07.165 --> 03:10.132
I'm not fishing,
and I'm not staying.

03:10.134 --> 03:13.336
What if I told you about
a murder that's about to occur?

03:13.338 --> 03:18.140
You really afford to walk away
with that on your conscience?

03:22.413 --> 03:25.481
(siren wailing)

03:25.483 --> 03:27.083
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Police!

03:27.085 --> 03:28.084
Break it up!
Hey, break it up!

03:28.086 --> 03:29.218
Come on, break it up!

03:29.220 --> 03:30.386
Look, that's enough! Hey!

03:30.388 --> 03:31.587
That's enough, that's enough.

03:31.589 --> 03:32.722
- Hey.
- That's enough, that's enough.

03:32.724 --> 03:33.956
- Let's go, break it up, break it up.
- Hey!

03:33.958 --> 03:35.891
- Let it go, now.
- Break it up, break it up.

03:35.893 --> 03:37.994
(indistinct shouting)
Let's go. Hey, break it up!

03:37.996 --> 03:40.013
I told you to stay the hell
away from my daughter!

03:40.037 --> 03:40.664
Get your hands off me!

03:40.665 --> 03:42.665
(indistinct shouting)
Huh?!

03:42.667 --> 03:44.367
- Hey. Hey.
- You had something to do with this!

03:44.369 --> 03:46.235
Break it up!
It's over! Break it up,

03:46.237 --> 03:47.270
break it up, break it up.

03:47.272 --> 03:49.105
Enough.

03:49.107 --> 03:50.172
Break it up.

03:50.174 --> 03:52.141
It's over.
(woman sobbing)

03:53.111 --> 03:55.344
Hey. You want to tell me
what's going on?

03:55.346 --> 03:57.113
Somebody took my baby.

03:57.115 --> 03:57.676
What?

03:57.700 --> 03:59.616
Once they discharged me,
I went outside to catch a cab.

03:59.617 --> 04:02.351
And then this nurse came out
and said that...

04:02.353 --> 04:05.054
said that they needed
to see the baby again.

04:05.056 --> 04:06.956
And you just handed her to her?

04:06.958 --> 04:09.225
Now the hospital's saying that
they don't know where she is

04:09.227 --> 04:10.593
and they don't know anything

04:10.595 --> 04:12.695
about the nurse
who came to get me.

04:12.697 --> 04:14.230
You just need to calm down,
and we're gonna do our best

04:14.232 --> 04:15.298
to find your baby.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.298
What if she's gone for good?

04:16.301 --> 04:17.632
MAN:
Sofia!

04:17.635 --> 04:19.000
Sofia!

04:19.003 --> 04:20.403
Yo, don't listen
to your father!

04:20.404 --> 04:21.803
I didn't do this!

04:21.805 --> 04:23.039
You got to let
me talk to her.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.674
Okay. Let's get you inside.
12 David.

04:24.676 --> 04:26.475
Let's get you warmed up, okay?
Be advised, we have a missing baby.

04:26.477 --> 04:28.477
Let's go inside, okay?
Request a patrol supervisor.

04:29.781 --> 04:33.781

04:56.816 --> 04:58.182
Thanks for your time.

05:00.319 --> 05:02.553
You're the guys who were talking
to Sofia before, right?

05:02.555 --> 05:04.054
Yeah, but we were just
the first to arrive.

05:04.056 --> 05:05.489
The detectives
are in charge now.

05:05.491 --> 05:07.791
This is so messed up.

05:07.793 --> 05:08.926
Her family thinks

05:08.928 --> 05:11.338
I had something to do
with taking the baby.

05:11.339 --> 05:12.181
Mm-hmm.

05:12.205 --> 05:13.732
When did you break up
with the baby's mother?

05:13.733 --> 05:15.566
Oh, about a month ago.

05:15.568 --> 05:17.201
You know,
her father doesn't like me

05:17.203 --> 05:18.402
'cause of where I'm from.

05:18.404 --> 05:21.972
I thought having the baby
would put us past all that.

05:21.974 --> 05:24.041
Did you even get to see
your daughter?

05:24.043 --> 05:25.409
Yeah.

05:25.411 --> 05:28.012
Held her for, like, two seconds.

05:28.014 --> 05:31.348
Before Sofia's father threatened
to beat me up.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.553
You guys think I staged this?

05:36.555 --> 05:37.988
Sir, we don't think anything.

05:37.990 --> 05:39.830
We're just trying to make sure
the baby's safe.

05:45.398 --> 05:47.264
Can you give her a message
for me?

05:47.266 --> 05:49.600
We don't get in the middle
of stuff like that.

05:49.602 --> 05:50.634
Just...

05:50.636 --> 05:53.604
tell her I love her.

05:53.606 --> 05:55.239
All right?

05:57.076 --> 05:58.742
And you don't know what
something's gonna mean to you

05:58.744 --> 06:00.911
until you've lost it.

06:00.913 --> 06:02.246
(sobs)

06:10.790 --> 06:14.258
I didn't realize you thought
terrorism was within my purview.

06:14.260 --> 06:15.893
Normally,
it wouldn't be.

06:15.895 --> 06:19.329
But, Kelly, I need
to unlock this phone.

06:19.331 --> 06:21.632
Well, then you need to make
your case with Televast.

06:21.634 --> 06:22.966
They own the technology.

06:22.968 --> 06:24.034
I know who they are.

06:24.036 --> 06:25.069
And we're getting nowhere.

06:25.071 --> 06:27.171
But your office
has tens of millions

06:27.173 --> 06:29.239
in city contracts with them.

06:29.241 --> 06:30.674
And what do you think that buys?

06:30.676 --> 06:32.643
Well, I hope, leverage.

06:32.645 --> 06:34.344
(scoffs) About
as much leverage

06:34.346 --> 06:37.314
as a single town
boycotting McDonald's has

06:37.316 --> 06:40.384
on McDonald's.
Except when lives are at stake.

06:41.253 --> 06:43.187
(sighs)

06:43.189 --> 06:46.523
Televast has had
over 60 court orders

06:46.525 --> 06:48.325
brought
by law enforcement agencies

06:48.327 --> 06:49.493
around the...
72.

06:49.495 --> 06:51.462
72. Okay, fine.

06:51.464 --> 06:55.499
And all of those warrants
ordering them to give up

06:55.501 --> 06:57.734
proprietary
technology,

06:57.736 --> 06:59.903
none of them have been upheld.

06:59.905 --> 07:03.874
But none issued during
a credible, impending threat.

07:03.876 --> 07:06.977
I still don't have
any leverage here.

07:06.979 --> 07:09.146
Kelly, come on,
you've got a better Rolodex

07:09.148 --> 07:10.914
than I do with
these kind of people.

07:10.916 --> 07:14.485
Oh, Frank, nobody uses
a Rolodex anymore.

07:15.521 --> 07:16.854
Sorry, boss...

07:18.691 --> 07:20.824
What is it?

07:20.826 --> 07:23.060
Backpack bomber
at the PATH station downtown.

07:23.062 --> 07:26.029
Two officers,
three civilians wounded--

07:26.031 --> 07:29.266
two critical.
(Frank sighs)

07:29.268 --> 07:32.636
Any likely?

07:32.638 --> 07:35.005
No word yet.

07:36.041 --> 07:37.808
I'm so sorry.

07:39.879 --> 07:42.079
FRANK: We need
some cooperation.

07:42.081 --> 07:44.348
I just don't think
they're going to play ball.

07:44.350 --> 07:46.984
This isn't ball,
this is people's lives.

07:46.986 --> 07:48.819
Please, I'm begging you, Kelly.

07:50.356 --> 07:52.689
(door shuts)

07:52.691 --> 07:55.192
You're telling me that
you went behind my back

07:55.194 --> 07:56.593
for a sit-down
with John Romano?

07:56.595 --> 07:58.962
It wasn't a sit-down, I got
sandbagged by a priest.

07:58.964 --> 08:00.597
I didn't even know anyone else
was gonna be there.

08:00.599 --> 08:02.866
Oh, my goodness,
I arrested his kid,

08:02.868 --> 08:05.302
who, incidentally, is a
scumbag, just like his father.

08:05.304 --> 08:08.005
Look, John Romano is telling us
he has information

08:08.007 --> 08:09.506
about a murder
that's about to go down.

08:09.508 --> 08:11.141
And you believed him?

08:12.645 --> 08:14.945
Oh, great.
You're in on this, too?

08:14.947 --> 08:16.380
No, this time I'm on your side.

08:16.382 --> 08:18.348
I know all about
Romano and his son.

08:18.350 --> 08:20.384
Apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

08:20.386 --> 08:21.618
I rest my case.

08:21.620 --> 08:23.687
You're being hustled.
I agree.

08:23.689 --> 08:25.122
Let me remind you both

08:25.124 --> 08:28.025
we have someone coming forward
with information about a crime.

08:28.027 --> 08:29.326
And if the crime does happen,

08:29.328 --> 08:30.961
it would be
a public-service murder.

08:30.963 --> 08:31.745
Yeah.

08:31.769 --> 08:33.674
- Skels killing skels.
- Exactly.

08:33.674 --> 08:36.534
Which we have a sworn obligation
to try to prevent.

08:36.534 --> 08:37.568
Now, I don't like
making deals

08:37.570 --> 08:40.203
with the John Romanos
of the world either,

08:40.206 --> 08:43.539
but we all know that informants
are not always choirboys.

08:43.542 --> 08:46.944
We need to hear this out.
There is no choice about it.

08:46.946 --> 08:49.646
(quietly):
Impossible.

08:49.648 --> 08:51.882
Hey. Eddie, stand down.

08:51.884 --> 08:54.084
- They want us back at the precinct.
- Why?

08:54.086 --> 08:56.386
Both the families showed up
pointing fingers.

08:56.388 --> 08:57.955
They're trying to get 'em calm
so they can interview 'em.

08:57.957 --> 09:01.358
They really think a family
member orchestrated all this?

09:02.695 --> 09:03.927
Is that what you think?

09:03.929 --> 09:05.395
Two parents are estranged.

09:05.397 --> 09:06.863
Somebody might be
looking for leverage.

09:06.865 --> 09:09.066
No way Sofia and Jorge
are involved.

09:09.068 --> 09:10.834
We've seen the way
they look at each other.

09:10.836 --> 09:12.135
They're in love.

09:12.137 --> 09:13.503
You sound a little bit
romantic there, Eddie.

09:13.505 --> 09:14.738
You sure you're not
seeing what you want to see?

09:14.740 --> 09:15.973
What's that supposed to mean?

09:15.975 --> 09:17.507
I'm just saying,
sometimes when people

09:17.509 --> 09:18.942
have been together, and
they have a bad breakup,

09:18.944 --> 09:20.444
that they can do
terrible things.

09:20.446 --> 09:21.912
Sorry, I'm not buying it.

09:21.914 --> 09:23.981
They don't seem like
the vengeful types.

09:27.019 --> 09:28.385
Hey, hold on.
(Janko sighs)

09:34.526 --> 09:36.293
What is it?

09:36.295 --> 09:38.295
It's the baby's ID tag.
It looks like it's been cut off.

09:38.297 --> 09:40.631
If this was a planned
family abduction,

09:40.633 --> 09:42.933
why would you just drop it
so close to the hospital?

09:42.935 --> 09:44.601
Yeah. Uh-huh.

09:46.105 --> 09:47.638
Why the hell
should we believe

09:47.640 --> 09:50.073
a single thing that
you're telling us right now?

09:50.075 --> 09:54.044
I'm a law-abiding citizen,
here of my own volition,

09:54.046 --> 09:56.980
offering information relevant
to a criminal matter.

09:56.982 --> 09:59.916
You're also asking for an
outrageous deal for your son.

09:59.918 --> 10:01.485
DANNY: Uh-huh.
Probation, when we have him dead to rights

10:01.487 --> 10:04.454
on racketeering
and enterprise corruption.

10:04.456 --> 10:06.623
Same thing as a "get out
of jail free" card.

10:06.625 --> 10:09.092
I'm betting you all
have children.

10:09.094 --> 10:10.961
Wouldn't you do anything
to help them out?

10:11.797 --> 10:14.097
Come on.

10:14.099 --> 10:16.199
That's what I thought.
It's all about family.

10:16.201 --> 10:18.001
No, it's not about family, okay?

10:18.003 --> 10:20.337
And if you're such
a law-abiding citizen,

10:20.339 --> 10:21.471
how the hell
do you know know about

10:21.473 --> 10:22.839
these crimes that
are about to happen?

10:22.841 --> 10:25.142
I'm in waste management.
You he things.

10:25.144 --> 10:26.143
ABETEMARCO: Oh, you just
happened to overhear

10:26.145 --> 10:27.878
someone talking about murder?

10:27.880 --> 10:31.048
From what I could glean,
a taxpayer wasn't going along

10:31.050 --> 10:33.050
with a take-over
of his family's business.

10:33.052 --> 10:35.185
So now he's gonna get a lesson.

10:35.187 --> 10:36.586
ERIN:
And you don't have a name?

10:36.588 --> 10:38.255
Just a time and a place?

10:38.257 --> 10:39.923
That's all I got.

10:39.925 --> 10:41.124
Pardon my language, Erin,

10:41.126 --> 10:43.060
but I think
this guy's jerking our chain.

10:43.062 --> 10:44.094
Ya think?

10:44.096 --> 10:45.429
(sighs)
Look, I am telling you,

10:45.431 --> 10:48.532
there is gonna be a hit
on that corner tonight.

10:48.534 --> 10:49.933
An older muscle car is

10:49.935 --> 10:51.268
gonna pull up
to a family

10:51.270 --> 10:53.370
station wagon,
like it's a payoff.

10:53.372 --> 10:54.538
The victim's wife and children

10:54.540 --> 10:56.440
are gonna be in the car with him.
- Hold on.

10:56.442 --> 10:58.241
You didn't say anything about
a whole family being involved.

10:58.243 --> 10:59.509
Yeah, you didn't tell us that.

10:59.511 --> 11:00.610
Didn't I?

11:00.612 --> 11:02.045
No, you didn't.

11:02.848 --> 11:04.748
Well, what I heard is,

11:04.750 --> 11:06.450
they're gonna kill 'em all.

11:06.452 --> 11:09.853
As a father...
I can't accept that.

11:09.855 --> 11:12.255
This sounds like
a bunch of crap.

11:12.257 --> 11:13.890
Keep telling yourself that.

11:14.376 --> 11:17.391
But you ignore me, and something
happens to those poor people,

11:18.275 --> 11:20.342
that's gonna be on all of you.

11:25.405 --> 11:27.836
Come on, Eddie. Let's go.
It's not our case anymore,

11:27.837 --> 11:30.404
and we were supposed to be back
at the house 20 minutes ago.

11:30.406 --> 11:32.740
Would you just let me finish
looking through this?

11:32.742 --> 11:34.609
If she dropped the
bracelet down the street,

11:34.611 --> 11:37.144
maybe there's something here.

11:37.146 --> 11:39.380
You know, you're going
to smell like a Staten Island

11:39.382 --> 11:42.116
garbage dump when you go
to your date tonight.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.252
- Aha.
- What? What do you got?

11:45.254 --> 11:46.921
Nurse's scrubs.
What she was wearing

11:46.923 --> 11:48.956
when she convinced Sofia
to give her the baby.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.725
All right, we got to call this
in to the detectives.

11:50.727 --> 11:52.460
Officers, can I help you?

11:52.462 --> 11:54.762
Yes. Uh, sir,
we're looking for a woman

11:54.764 --> 11:56.931
running around with a newborn
that might not be hers.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.065
Have you seen
anyone like that?

11:58.067 --> 11:59.367
Allah.

11:59.369 --> 12:00.568
You have seen her?

12:00.570 --> 12:02.637
She was in my store earlier

12:02.639 --> 12:04.839
trying to buy infant formula
and food for herself,

12:04.841 --> 12:07.074
but she only had enough
for the formula.

12:07.076 --> 12:09.744
- Did the baby seem okay?
- Yes, but it wouldn't stop crying.

12:09.746 --> 12:11.412
The-the lady
didn't know what to do.

12:11.414 --> 12:13.614
- You know which way she went?
-No.

12:13.616 --> 12:15.182
I'm sorry.
I had other customers.

12:15.184 --> 12:16.851
She just took the formula
and left.

12:16.853 --> 12:18.619
All right, you got security
cameras that work in here?

12:18.621 --> 12:20.388
Let's go take a look. Come on.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:30.343 --> 12:32.877
Commissioner, I am
the chief operating officer.

12:32.879 --> 12:34.913
This is outside my scope.

12:34.915 --> 12:37.949
Well, you're the only one in
the room who works for Televast,

12:37.951 --> 12:40.018
so you're our man right now.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.220
I am sorry. I am not your man.

12:42.222 --> 12:46.391
Can you unlock a phone
that works on your system?

12:46.393 --> 12:47.425
Can or may?

12:47.427 --> 12:48.560
Martin.

12:48.562 --> 12:50.695
Don't make light of this,
please.

12:50.697 --> 12:53.598
This is an important
distinction.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.468
And, yes, we can create software
to override firewalls

12:57.470 --> 12:59.571
and encryptions, but we
can't give it out, for a lot

12:59.573 --> 13:01.839
of very good, very...
legal reasons.

13:01.841 --> 13:03.274
Name one.

13:03.276 --> 13:05.276
Okay, this one.

13:05.278 --> 13:07.679
We'd be handing law enforcement
a very powerful tool

13:07.681 --> 13:09.547
that would allow you to
invade anyone's privacy

13:09.549 --> 13:11.849
any time for any
reason you see fit.

13:11.851 --> 13:14.752
Not looking to do that.

13:14.754 --> 13:17.222
But you'd have the capability.

13:18.858 --> 13:21.159
(sighs)

13:21.161 --> 13:23.428
You support FAA safety measures?

13:23.430 --> 13:25.830
Automobile crash standards?
What does that have to...?

13:25.832 --> 13:27.599
Yes or no?

13:27.601 --> 13:30.001
Yes.

13:30.003 --> 13:32.237
Because they protect
the safety and well-being

13:32.239 --> 13:34.205
of the general public--
your customers--

13:34.207 --> 13:36.241
from potential harm.

13:36.243 --> 13:38.876
I'm not here for a lecture,
all due respect.

13:38.878 --> 13:42.947
Uh, Frank, hyperbole is not
going to resolve this.

13:44.718 --> 13:48.353
Terrorists have weaponized
your product, Mr. Post,

13:48.355 --> 13:51.889
as sure as if it were an
airliner or a rented box truck,

13:51.891 --> 13:54.025
and you're gonna sit here
and tell me

13:54.027 --> 13:56.661
that people's privacy deserves
your protection,

13:56.663 --> 13:58.997
but their lives do not?

14:00.267 --> 14:02.500
We are from different worlds,
Commissioner.

14:02.502 --> 14:06.537
Well, right now...

14:06.539 --> 14:09.941
we are in the same one--
our city.

14:09.943 --> 14:13.444
You need to step up.

14:13.446 --> 14:15.146
What's this?

14:15.148 --> 14:19.284
FRANK: Victims of the blast at
the PATH station this morning.

14:21.888 --> 14:23.855
Commissioner, I, um...

14:23.857 --> 14:25.990
I'm so sorry
for their tragedy,

14:25.992 --> 14:28.593
but this is not how it works.

14:28.595 --> 14:31.062
You can't expect me
to just fold up and comply.

14:31.064 --> 14:33.097
This one lost a leg.

14:33.099 --> 14:35.199
I bet if you asked her,
she'd be willing

14:35.201 --> 14:38.469
to give up some privacy
to get it back.

14:41.641 --> 14:43.374
I'm sorry.

15:07.233 --> 15:09.734
This is ridiculous.
You know that, right?

15:09.736 --> 15:11.469
Probably. (sighs)

15:11.471 --> 15:12.937
I don't even know
which direction

15:12.939 --> 15:14.605
we're supposed to
be looking in.

15:14.607 --> 15:17.141
I mean, no names,
no license plate numbers.

15:17.143 --> 15:19.844
- A muscle car and a station wagon.
- Mm-hmm.

15:19.846 --> 15:22.547
John Romano must be
laughing his ass off,

15:22.549 --> 15:24.615
thinking about us
sitting here all night,

15:24.617 --> 15:27.185
waiting to watch
a so-called hit go down.

15:27.187 --> 15:30.688
You know, you are welcome
to leave if you want. Go home,

15:30.690 --> 15:32.957
put on your nice
jammies, dunk a glass

15:32.959 --> 15:34.726
of warm milk,
but I'm staying.

15:34.728 --> 15:36.894
Why? You that afraid
of your sister?

15:36.896 --> 15:39.430
- I'm not afraid of my sister, okay?
- (laughing)

15:39.432 --> 15:41.299
Just can't stand when
she says, "I told you so."

15:41.301 --> 15:44.268
Ah, she's pretty decent
about that. Usually.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.070
Not rubbing your nose
in the dirt.

15:46.072 --> 15:48.239
Yeah, but when she does it,

15:48.241 --> 15:50.441
you feel it.

15:50.443 --> 15:53.077
Erin's all right. She just
doesn't look at it like a cop.

15:53.079 --> 15:54.612
She sees both sides.

15:54.614 --> 15:56.247
Hold on.

15:57.884 --> 15:59.984
That's a family.

15:59.986 --> 16:02.019
They fit the
description?

16:02.021 --> 16:04.455
Yes, they fit
the description.

16:04.457 --> 16:07.158
(station wagon engine starts)

16:14.167 --> 16:17.502
And that's a Buick
Grand National.

16:17.504 --> 16:18.703
That counts.

16:21.508 --> 16:22.573
Let's go.

16:22.575 --> 16:25.143
(tires squealing)

16:25.145 --> 16:27.245
(engine revving)

16:29.416 --> 16:31.215
(tires squealing)

16:31.217 --> 16:33.951
(horn honking,
tires screeching)

16:34.654 --> 16:36.587
Police!

16:36.589 --> 16:38.856
Turn off the engine,
throw the keys out the window!

16:38.858 --> 16:40.358
And put your hands
out the window

16:40.360 --> 16:41.325
where I can see 'em!

16:41.327 --> 16:42.894
Officer, what did I do?

16:42.896 --> 16:44.495
Shut up!

16:45.265 --> 16:47.565
You ran a red light,
tough guy.

16:47.567 --> 16:49.283
- Watch that.
- You're gonna shoot me for that?

16:49.284 --> 16:51.585
Let me see your hands.
Get 'em out the window now!

16:54.723 --> 16:55.889
Get your ass on the ground.

16:55.891 --> 16:59.059
Get on the ground.
(groans)

17:01.096 --> 17:02.796
Shut up.

17:02.798 --> 17:05.464
Look what I found.

17:12.307 --> 17:14.907
Hey.

17:14.910 --> 17:16.510
I've been thinking
about what Jorge said.

17:16.512 --> 17:17.711
About how you don't know what

17:17.713 --> 17:19.445
something means to you
until you've lost it.

17:19.448 --> 17:20.547
Yeah?

17:20.549 --> 17:21.714
What if this was a woman

17:21.717 --> 17:23.817
who took the baby
because she lost one of her own?

17:23.819 --> 17:26.420
Kind of a stretch,
don't you think?

17:26.422 --> 17:27.887
You got a better idea?

17:27.890 --> 17:29.222
The detectives
have already warned us

17:29.224 --> 17:31.124
about treading on their turf,
and you and I are both

17:31.126 --> 17:32.392
almost capped out
on our overtime.

17:32.394 --> 17:33.994
Well, when has that
ever stopped us?

17:33.996 --> 17:35.162
And I thought you had plans.

17:35.164 --> 17:37.164
Don't you have to do
Trivia Night with Barry?

17:37.166 --> 17:40.367
This is more important.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.509
What are you guys thinking?

17:49.511 --> 17:52.479
I hate to say it, but
Romano's tip was on the money.

17:52.481 --> 17:54.347
Or he made it look that way.

17:54.349 --> 17:56.083
ABETEMARCO: Look, he gave us
a time and place.

17:56.085 --> 17:58.418
And he was right about
the family being targeted

17:58.420 --> 17:59.953
because
of the father's business.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.254
And the hit man had

18:01.256 --> 18:04.357
a fully-loaded MP7
ready to rock and roll.

18:04.359 --> 18:05.859
Do we know
who took out the contract?

18:05.861 --> 18:07.961
He was hired through
an intermediary in the DR.

18:07.963 --> 18:08.962
Conveniently.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.263
ABETEMARCO:
It was a one-night stand.

18:10.265 --> 18:11.898
They flew the shooter in
this afternoon,

18:11.900 --> 18:13.533
and they were gonna
fly him out tomorrow.

18:13.535 --> 18:14.935
And he really doesn't know
who set this up?

18:14.937 --> 18:16.103
DANNY:
Look, I'm telling you

18:16.105 --> 18:17.104
both who set it up.

18:17.106 --> 18:18.271
It was Romano himself.

18:18.273 --> 18:19.873
ABETEMARCO:
Look, I don't trust the guy

18:19.875 --> 18:23.743
either, but we got no proof
of that. All we do know is that

18:23.745 --> 18:25.645
these people would've been dead
if we weren't there tonight.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.013
Well, that much is true.

18:27.015 --> 18:29.282
His son is looking at 25 years.

18:29.284 --> 18:32.652
Romano wants us to plead it down
to time served and probation.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.421
Screw him and the kid, okay?

18:34.423 --> 18:37.157
This is a one-hit wonder,
and you're being played!

18:37.159 --> 18:39.159
What do you think?

18:39.161 --> 18:42.262
Look, the guy demonstrated
he's credible.

18:42.264 --> 18:44.965
He fed us good information,
and he's right

18:44.967 --> 18:46.233
that this is what we do here.

18:46.235 --> 18:48.201
We make deals
with the devil every day.

18:51.940 --> 18:54.040
I don't know what their
procedures are across town,

18:54.042 --> 18:55.775
but we don't lose
babies at this hospital.

18:55.777 --> 18:57.644
Well, look, this is,
like, the third facility

18:57.646 --> 18:59.746
we've been to tonight.
We're not here to point fingers.

18:59.748 --> 19:01.448
We just want to know
if you've had contact

19:01.450 --> 19:02.315
with anyone
who could have done this.

19:02.339 --> 19:02.950
Yeah.

19:02.951 --> 19:05.485
Like someone who might have
recently lost a baby of her own?

19:05.487 --> 19:07.387
So that's a crime now?

19:07.389 --> 19:09.055
Do you recognize her, ma'am?

19:11.160 --> 19:15.162
Oh. It's Alice,
our little frequent flier.

19:15.164 --> 19:17.030
Alice? Alice who?
Where do you know her from?

19:17.032 --> 19:18.498
She's been here a few times.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.534
What did you mean when you
called her a "frequent flier"?

19:20.536 --> 19:24.804
Sorry. You guys have your way
of coping, and we have ours.

19:24.806 --> 19:26.173
She, um,

19:26.175 --> 19:28.608
had a stillborn here
a couple of years ago.

19:28.610 --> 19:29.809
Been back at least twice
since then.

19:29.811 --> 19:31.278
Twice?

19:31.280 --> 19:34.147
Claiming she was pregnant again,
and tests showed she wasn't.

19:34.149 --> 19:35.882
Poor girl.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.817
She was a little wacky,

19:37.819 --> 19:40.587
but losing the baby
really unhinged her.

19:41.456 --> 19:42.789
Do you know where she lives now?

19:42.791 --> 19:46.459
No. Last I heard,
she was homeless.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.533
(sighs)

20:02.535 --> 20:04.533
Seriously, Eddie, it's the
end of an extended tour.

20:04.534 --> 20:05.866
Let's give it a rest.

20:05.868 --> 20:07.969
You said it yourself.
There's only so many places

20:07.971 --> 20:09.651
Alice can hide
with a newborn and no money.

20:09.986 --> 20:11.072
Excuse me, sir?

20:11.073 --> 20:12.272
Are you the shelter manager?

20:12.274 --> 20:13.973
Yes, I am.
What can I do for you?

20:13.975 --> 20:15.809
Have you seen this woman?

20:15.811 --> 20:18.344
Yeah, she came in last night
with a baby.

20:18.346 --> 20:19.579
Is she in any trouble?

20:19.581 --> 20:21.648
She here now?
She ought to be.

20:21.650 --> 20:23.416
She hasn't checked out.

20:23.418 --> 20:25.318
Yeah, second floor, 2B,

20:25.320 --> 20:26.553
end of the hall.

20:31.860 --> 20:32.992
(woman yelps)

20:32.994 --> 20:34.394
Take it easy.

20:34.396 --> 20:35.895
Did you see the woman
staying in this room?

20:35.897 --> 20:37.964
Did you see...?
No.

20:37.966 --> 20:39.032
Hit it.

20:39.034 --> 20:41.000
Okay?

20:44.106 --> 20:45.238
(baby crying)

20:45.240 --> 20:46.473
Alice!

20:46.475 --> 20:48.708
Hey!

20:50.679 --> 20:52.045
Central, 12 David.
Suspect fleeing

20:52.047 --> 20:53.880
the rear of this location
with the baby.

20:53.882 --> 20:55.682
Come on.

20:58.887 --> 21:00.954
(elevator bell dings)

21:00.956 --> 21:02.522
I'm sorry, Ms. Peterson.

21:02.524 --> 21:04.390
I didn't want to turn
you away downstairs.

21:04.392 --> 21:05.558
Why would you do that?

21:05.560 --> 21:07.160
I don't have you down
for an appointment.

21:07.162 --> 21:08.294
That's because I don't have one.

21:08.296 --> 21:09.896
And I'm sorry, but
he's unfortunately...

21:09.898 --> 21:11.998
He's booked, I know,
but this is important.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.133
I'm sure it is, but he's...

21:13.135 --> 21:16.002
Look, I'm trying
to help your boss,

21:16.004 --> 21:18.938
but calling in a raid
on Televast's offices

21:18.940 --> 21:20.306
does nothing to help the cause.

21:20.308 --> 21:22.942
Our officers had a warrant
as part of a preexisting

21:22.944 --> 21:24.611
drug trafficking
investigation.

21:24.613 --> 21:26.746
The company may have relevant
e-mails on their servers.

21:26.748 --> 21:28.281
Can you fit me in?

21:28.283 --> 21:29.949
I could, but I won't.

21:29.951 --> 21:31.618
You won't?

21:31.620 --> 21:33.052
No, because he's not here.

21:33.054 --> 21:35.355
(sighs) Where is he?

21:35.357 --> 21:37.357
At one of the two hospitals
where the victims

21:37.359 --> 21:39.893
from this morning's attack
are being treated.

21:39.895 --> 21:41.728
Oh.

21:41.730 --> 21:43.796
Okay.
(elevator bell dings)

21:45.934 --> 21:48.034
Kelly Peterson is
here to see you, sir.

21:48.036 --> 21:50.470
I can see that.

21:50.472 --> 21:52.839
Please.

21:59.748 --> 22:02.682
I had to do something.

22:02.684 --> 22:04.951
You mean visiting the victims
in the hospital?

22:04.953 --> 22:08.121
What? No.

22:08.123 --> 22:11.090
About the raid on their offices.

22:11.092 --> 22:13.126
That's what you're here
to flog me about, isn't it?

22:13.128 --> 22:14.160
Yes.

22:14.162 --> 22:15.828
Yeah, well, don't bother.

22:15.830 --> 22:17.597
I know it was like
throwing pebbles,

22:17.599 --> 22:20.133
but sometimes,
if pebbles is all you got,

22:20.135 --> 22:21.634
that's what you throw.

22:21.636 --> 22:22.902
This isn't pebbles.

22:22.904 --> 22:25.638
This is intimidation,
plain and simple.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.692
A judge signed off on it,
plain and simple.

22:27.716 --> 22:30.610
Yeah. Judge Schlossberg,
great friend of this office.

22:30.612 --> 22:33.112
And not a fair-weather one,
either.

22:34.583 --> 22:37.350
(exhales)

22:37.352 --> 22:39.619
I'm sorry.

22:39.621 --> 22:41.621
That was a cheap shot.

22:43.158 --> 22:44.791
(sighs)

22:44.793 --> 22:47.093
I did what you
asked me to do.

22:47.095 --> 22:50.263
But do you get it, Kelly?

22:52.067 --> 22:54.867
Do you get
what this is really about?

22:54.869 --> 22:58.271
Yes. The legal protection
of privacy.

22:58.273 --> 22:59.706
Oh.
What?

22:59.708 --> 23:01.140
Seriously?

23:02.110 --> 23:03.876
Where someone's
online porn habits

23:03.878 --> 23:07.347
or gambling losses
or extramarital activities

23:07.349 --> 23:10.316
take precedence
over threats to human lives?

23:10.318 --> 23:11.484
You're oversimplifying.

23:11.486 --> 23:13.186
Well, maybe someone should.

23:14.623 --> 23:16.589
Martin Post cares more
about his machines

23:16.591 --> 23:19.025
and his software
than his fellow man.

23:19.027 --> 23:21.227
There it is. Sorry.

23:21.229 --> 23:24.264
Sad day all around.

23:25.133 --> 23:27.066
There's no talking to you

23:27.068 --> 23:28.301
when you're like this.

23:28.303 --> 23:29.836
Like what? Right?

23:29.838 --> 23:31.437
Like... (grumbles)

23:31.439 --> 23:34.240
"Back in my day,
dot, dot, dot..."

23:44.019 --> 23:46.386
Did you visit the victims?

23:46.388 --> 23:47.954
Yeah.

23:47.956 --> 23:49.722
Good for you.

23:49.724 --> 23:51.491
They got hurt on my watch.

23:51.493 --> 23:54.994
Well, not everybody
would do that.

23:54.996 --> 23:57.664
Good for you.

24:00.869 --> 24:03.036
I mean it.

24:05.173 --> 24:07.840
And I'll allow

24:07.842 --> 24:10.677
that you're... half right

24:10.679 --> 24:14.714
about a very complicated
subject.

24:18.186 --> 24:22.288
And I'll go take another run
at Martin Post.

24:35.070 --> 24:36.502
See? What'd I tell you?

24:36.504 --> 24:37.870
I'm a man of my word.

24:37.872 --> 24:39.238
Yes, you are.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.507
Once a snake, always a snake.

24:41.509 --> 24:43.343
You say something, Detective?

24:43.345 --> 24:44.811
You're not gonna pull the wool
over my eyes.

24:44.813 --> 24:47.013
I see you for exactly
who you are, Romano.

24:47.015 --> 24:48.114
I'm not getting down

24:48.116 --> 24:50.149
in the mud, Ms. Reagan.

24:50.151 --> 24:51.751
This suit's too expensive.

24:51.753 --> 24:53.353
Stole it right off the rack,
did you?

24:53.355 --> 24:54.587
Enough already.

24:55.623 --> 24:57.223
So, I upheld

24:57.225 --> 24:58.291
my end of the bargain.

24:58.293 --> 24:59.692
Are you gonna uphold yours?

25:00.695 --> 25:02.795
I'm not going along with this.

25:02.797 --> 25:04.163
Danny, please.

25:04.165 --> 25:05.732
Ms. Reagan,

25:05.734 --> 25:08.401
you have a reputation
as a woman of honor.

25:08.403 --> 25:10.203
I hope not a naive one.

25:10.205 --> 25:12.038
Well, let me sweeten the pot.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.907
I'm willing to make
my cooperation ongoing.

25:15.910 --> 25:16.943
At what cost?

25:16.945 --> 25:19.479
(laughs) Why be so suspicious?

25:19.481 --> 25:20.847
One hand washes the other.

25:20.849 --> 25:23.483
This could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

25:23.485 --> 25:24.951
Famous last words.

25:24.953 --> 25:26.386
Detective, you be you.

25:27.288 --> 25:29.522
Ms. Reagan,
are you gonna serve justice,

25:29.524 --> 25:31.424
or are you gonna kowtow
to your brother

25:31.426 --> 25:33.292
and his small-mindedness?

25:35.497 --> 25:37.830
Okay, thank you.

25:37.832 --> 25:39.799
Another dead end?

25:41.469 --> 25:43.803
Sofia?
(voice breaking): Hey.

25:44.939 --> 25:47.306
Look, I-I'm sorry
to bother you guys,

25:47.308 --> 25:48.574
but I'm just freaking out,

25:48.576 --> 25:50.943
and none of the detectives
are telling me anything.

25:50.945 --> 25:53.513
Sofia, we're pushing
on every front.

25:53.515 --> 25:55.515
They told me that you found out
about the woman

25:55.517 --> 25:57.450
that I found
from the photo array?

25:57.452 --> 25:59.018
Please, have a seat.

25:59.020 --> 26:00.453
Please.

26:00.455 --> 26:02.288
(takes deep breath)

26:02.290 --> 26:03.823
We have some leads.

26:03.825 --> 26:05.925
Okay. Well, where is she?

26:05.927 --> 26:07.760
Does she still have my baby?

26:07.762 --> 26:10.329
They spent the night at a...
at a shelter,

26:10.331 --> 26:12.265
and as far as we know,

26:12.267 --> 26:14.000
the baby seems all right.

26:14.002 --> 26:15.568
Are they not there anymore?

26:15.570 --> 26:17.670
We have a lot of people
trying to track her down,

26:17.672 --> 26:19.172
but she doesn't
have a cell phone

26:19.174 --> 26:20.440
or any credit cards.

26:20.442 --> 26:21.941
What about when...

26:21.943 --> 26:24.343
when it gets to be night
and the temperature drops?

26:24.345 --> 26:26.579
Sofia, you-you can't be
thinking like that.

26:26.581 --> 26:28.581
It-it won't do any good.

26:28.583 --> 26:29.982
But you're not making me...
(sniffles)

26:29.984 --> 26:32.652
a-any promises
that we'll get her back?

26:32.654 --> 26:33.986
We can't.

26:35.757 --> 26:37.156
(Sofia crying)

26:39.127 --> 26:42.528
A few days ago,
I had never even seen her.

26:42.530 --> 26:44.430
And now she's...

26:44.432 --> 26:47.533
the most important thing
in my life.

26:49.137 --> 26:51.737
And I may have lost her.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.340
(Sofia sobbing)

27:00.348 --> 27:03.282
So, the old man
got me sprung, huh?

27:03.284 --> 27:05.218
I wouldn't exactly
call it "sprung."

27:05.220 --> 27:07.553
You're out of Rikers
on a takeout order

27:07.555 --> 27:09.255
while the DA's office
waits to hear

27:09.257 --> 27:10.923
what you and your old man
have to say.

27:10.925 --> 27:12.225
Trust me, it wasn't my idea.

27:12.227 --> 27:14.460
Hmm, sounds like
someone got schooled.

27:14.462 --> 27:15.828
It is what it is.

27:15.830 --> 27:18.231
Apparently your old man
has some valuable information,

27:18.233 --> 27:19.732
and you're
the lucky beneficiary.

27:19.734 --> 27:22.134
And that makes you
the loser, right?

27:22.136 --> 27:24.670
- Whatever.
- How do you spell, "Suck it, Reagan"?

27:24.672 --> 27:26.472
I'm not your tutor, kid.

27:26.474 --> 27:28.207
I thought we were going

27:28.209 --> 27:29.675
straight from Rikers
to the DA's office.

27:29.677 --> 27:32.512
Oh, we were, but they're busy
at the DA's office,

27:32.514 --> 27:34.180
so now you get to cool
your heels here.

27:34.182 --> 27:35.414
Come on.

27:35.416 --> 27:37.617
Enjoy the conversation.

27:37.619 --> 27:40.620
Sure you two have
plenty to talk about.

27:44.492 --> 27:47.393
How you doing, kid?

27:49.764 --> 27:52.298
You really got to rain
on my parade every time?

27:52.300 --> 27:54.166
Eddie, I just don't want
to get our hopes up.

27:54.168 --> 27:55.635
(baby crying)

27:55.637 --> 27:58.237
Did you hear that?

28:00.275 --> 28:02.475
Hey. Hey!

28:02.477 --> 28:04.477
12 David, we're in pursuit
of the suspect.

28:19.127 --> 28:21.127
(baby crying)

28:21.129 --> 28:22.695
(baby whimpers)

28:22.697 --> 28:24.363
Shh, shh-shh-shh.

28:28.069 --> 28:30.136
JANKO:
Alice!

28:31.306 --> 28:32.872
Alice!

28:32.874 --> 28:34.507
Alice, come back!

28:34.509 --> 28:36.342
No one's gonna hurt you, Alice.
Come back!

28:41.382 --> 28:43.282
(siren wailing)

28:47.722 --> 28:49.121
JANKO:
Alice!

28:49.123 --> 28:50.756
Alice!
Hey!

28:51.326 --> 28:53.192
JANKO:
Alice!

28:53.194 --> 28:54.360
Whoa, no, no, no.

28:54.362 --> 28:55.695
Back off! I'll drop her

28:55.697 --> 28:57.363
if you try to take her from me.

28:57.365 --> 28:58.864
You don't want to be
doing that, Alice.

28:58.866 --> 29:01.434
You don't know what I've been
through to have this baby.

29:01.436 --> 29:04.136
Just keep her talking.
I'm gonna be the net.

29:04.138 --> 29:06.505
JANKO:
Alice, you're right.

29:06.507 --> 29:08.741
No one else can understand the
pain that you've been through.

29:08.743 --> 29:09.775
You're damn right.

29:09.777 --> 29:11.644
Think about the baby's mother.

29:11.646 --> 29:14.447
Think about the pain
that she's in right now.

29:15.717 --> 29:17.249
You really want
to spread that?

29:17.251 --> 29:20.186
What are you talking about?
(sirens approaching)

29:20.188 --> 29:21.854
I'm her mother.

29:21.856 --> 29:25.024
I know how much
you want that to be true,

29:25.026 --> 29:27.627
but...

29:27.629 --> 29:29.295
you've got to give her back.

29:31.232 --> 29:32.431
No!

29:35.536 --> 29:37.937
You've had that baby
a while now, right?

29:37.939 --> 29:39.271
And you've been
taking care of her.

29:39.273 --> 29:42.475
But you know you can't
keep doing it.

29:42.477 --> 29:45.811
Alice, you've got to start
taking care of yourself.

29:45.813 --> 29:47.279
(baby fussing)

29:47.281 --> 29:51.150
JANKO: If that baby means
anything to you,

29:51.152 --> 29:55.054
you will return her,
we'll take her,

29:55.056 --> 29:57.990
we'll put her back
where she belongs.

29:59.560 --> 30:02.561
That's what any mother
would do for a child.

30:02.563 --> 30:06.365
I just wanted someone to love.

30:06.367 --> 30:08.267
Everybody does.

30:17.812 --> 30:18.911
(sobs)

30:18.913 --> 30:20.046
Come on.

30:20.048 --> 30:21.681
Okay, okay...

30:23.584 --> 30:25.685
(sobs)

30:26.921 --> 30:28.821
(cooing)

30:30.792 --> 30:32.825
(sobbing)

30:32.827 --> 30:36.328
Shh. You're all right.

30:36.330 --> 30:38.931
Oh, my God.

30:38.933 --> 30:41.734
Jamie.

30:41.736 --> 30:43.536
- Is she okay?
-Yeah.

30:43.538 --> 30:46.072
We're okay.

30:46.074 --> 30:48.741
Oh...

30:58.670 --> 31:00.837
(all exclaiming)

31:13.618 --> 31:16.453
There you go. Measured, weighed
and all yours, for life, huh?

31:16.455 --> 31:18.988
Yeah, she's beautiful,
isn't she?

31:18.990 --> 31:20.390
She is.
Yeah.

31:20.392 --> 31:21.458
And healthy.

31:21.460 --> 31:23.793
(soft laughter)
Take her home.

31:23.795 --> 31:26.162
But this time, wait inside
the building till the cab comes.

31:26.164 --> 31:28.364
Yeah, we're not
taking any chances.

31:28.366 --> 31:31.134
No. This time,
Daddy's taking her home.

31:31.136 --> 31:32.836
You two back together now?

31:32.838 --> 31:34.471
Yeah, we're gonna take our shot.

31:34.473 --> 31:36.339
Right, baby?
Yeah.

31:36.341 --> 31:38.041
And your folks okay with that?

31:38.043 --> 31:39.509
If they're not,

31:39.511 --> 31:41.711
someone's gonna
have to fight me.

31:41.713 --> 31:43.947
(laughter)

31:44.816 --> 31:46.883
I have a little girl
in my life now.

31:46.885 --> 31:49.719
Thank you, both of you.

31:49.721 --> 31:52.021
Best of luck, you guys.

31:56.194 --> 32:00.029
Nice work there,
Officer Janko.

32:04.336 --> 32:06.503
May I?

32:12.410 --> 32:13.676
You're following me now?

32:13.678 --> 32:16.646
No. I was told you were here.

32:16.648 --> 32:19.749
Mm. Kelly sent you
in her stead? Well...

32:19.751 --> 32:21.150
That is, uh, going
to prove less than productive,

32:21.152 --> 32:22.452
I can promise you.

32:22.454 --> 32:25.255
She was coming here
to try to smooth things over

32:25.257 --> 32:27.190
between your firm
and my department.

32:27.192 --> 32:29.058
I offered to do it myself.

32:29.060 --> 32:30.126
How?

32:31.963 --> 32:34.430
I apologize for the raid.

32:34.432 --> 32:38.668
It was perfectly legal,
but also heavy-handed.

32:38.670 --> 32:41.437
Well, we'll see about legal.

32:41.439 --> 32:44.574
We both have businesses to run.

32:44.576 --> 32:46.776
I'm sure you have
stepped on some lines

32:46.778 --> 32:49.546
when the chips were down.

32:49.548 --> 32:51.781
And my chips are down.

32:51.783 --> 32:55.485
Well, I don't send in guys
with guns and warrants.

32:55.487 --> 32:58.488
We use what we have.

32:58.490 --> 33:00.423
So, again,

33:00.425 --> 33:05.795
personally, and privately,
my apologies.

33:05.797 --> 33:07.964
Okay.

33:07.966 --> 33:12.735
And you don't send in
guys with guns, no,

33:12.737 --> 33:15.939
but you do hire criminals.

33:15.941 --> 33:17.840
You hire hackers

33:17.842 --> 33:20.410
who used to be black hats
and call them white hats,

33:20.412 --> 33:22.946
now that they work for you.

33:22.948 --> 33:26.349
I-I thought I made
our position clear.

33:26.351 --> 33:27.717
We can't help you.

33:27.719 --> 33:29.986
"Can't" is not
the same as "won't."

33:29.988 --> 33:33.690
Okay, that is a distinction that
has no meaning in this case.

33:33.692 --> 33:37.961
If we can't protect privacy, our
company doesn't exist anymore.

33:37.963 --> 33:41.297
Frankly, that is nothing
compared to the consequences

33:41.299 --> 33:43.633
if we can't protect
our citizens.

33:43.635 --> 33:46.135
Well, we see consequences
that go beyond this case.

33:46.137 --> 33:50.006
And we see lives at stake,
in this case.

33:51.476 --> 33:55.645
And you didn't flee my office
because you were fed up.

33:55.647 --> 33:57.046
You fled

33:57.048 --> 34:02.785
because the pictures
of the victims moved you.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.628
Say I give you that backdoor.

34:11.630 --> 34:15.398
What's to stop you from using it
to spy on anyone?

34:15.400 --> 34:18.701
I'm giving you my word
that won't happen.

34:18.703 --> 34:20.103
That's not good enough.

34:20.105 --> 34:22.038
'Cause if the public
finds out that we yielded

34:22.040 --> 34:25.507
to the police on this, I...
it's game over for us.

34:25.510 --> 34:27.777
The public isn't here.

34:27.779 --> 34:31.481
Or your boss, or your board.

34:31.483 --> 34:35.784
It's just us.

34:35.786 --> 34:38.121
Forward me a number.

34:38.123 --> 34:43.226
That assumes what you say about
us using black hats is true.

34:43.228 --> 34:46.529
No, it doesn't,
just that you know one.

34:47.931 --> 34:50.266
Lend him to me.

34:50.268 --> 34:51.833
Do the right thing,
and hopefully,

34:51.835 --> 34:54.504
you'll never hear from me again.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.180
It's a steam-driven model.

35:04.182 --> 35:06.683
I'm used to it.

35:17.395 --> 35:19.595
(phone buzzes)

35:24.836 --> 35:28.705
Thank you, Mr. Post.

35:30.175 --> 35:32.341
Good luck, Commissioner.

35:42.854 --> 35:44.787
So, all's well that ends well.

35:44.789 --> 35:46.022
Right, Detective?

35:46.024 --> 35:47.724
You got me there.
JOHNNY: I think these guys

35:47.726 --> 35:50.359
are secretly relieved
we're not going to trial.

35:50.361 --> 35:53.029
They knew they had absolutely
no case against me.

35:53.031 --> 35:54.697
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

35:54.699 --> 35:56.499
Oh, well, then, bring it,
Lady Dynamite.

35:56.501 --> 35:57.867
Hit me with your best shot.

35:57.869 --> 35:59.769
All right, settle down, Johnny.

35:59.771 --> 36:02.271
So, Ms. Reagan, what do you say
we sign this deal

36:02.273 --> 36:05.408
so my son doesn't have to spend
another four months in Rikers?

36:05.410 --> 36:07.110
We're just waiting
for my investigator

36:07.112 --> 36:08.377
to bring the right papers.

36:08.379 --> 36:10.246
Oh, here he comes now.

36:10.248 --> 36:12.482
What's up, kid?

36:13.351 --> 36:15.284
What's this guy doing here?

36:15.286 --> 36:16.853
What, you know him?

36:16.855 --> 36:18.554
Yeah, he was in the
holding cell with me.

36:18.556 --> 36:19.956
He said he worked with you.

36:19.958 --> 36:23.159
Well, technically,
they are working together now.

36:25.029 --> 36:26.462
You didn't talk to him, did you?

36:26.464 --> 36:29.265
No. What kind of idiot
you think I am?

36:29.267 --> 36:30.433
(chuckles)

36:30.435 --> 36:32.268
Feel free to answer.
We're all waiting.

36:33.238 --> 36:34.570
Johnny, what did you tell him?

36:34.572 --> 36:35.638
Nothing.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.340
Actually, he told me a lot.

36:37.342 --> 36:39.041
Boy's very proud of you.

36:39.043 --> 36:40.943
In fact, he couldn't
stop running his mouth.

36:40.945 --> 36:42.745
Get up, stupid.

36:42.747 --> 36:43.813
I'm calling our lawyer.

36:43.815 --> 36:44.881
Too late for that.

36:44.883 --> 36:46.582
Wha...?
We got your son

36:46.584 --> 36:49.552
on tape, bragging about
the phony hit you set up

36:49.554 --> 36:51.721
on that family,
among other things.

36:51.723 --> 36:53.055
Dad, it's not true.

36:53.057 --> 36:54.757
Just shut up, son.
You've said enough already.

36:54.759 --> 36:57.226
I guess the apple rolled
a little far from the tree

36:57.228 --> 36:59.028
when it comes to talking, huh?

36:59.030 --> 37:02.265
Well, they'll both have
plenty of time to talk now,

37:02.267 --> 37:04.367
since they're both
going to prison.

37:10.175 --> 37:12.909
Barry, uh...

37:12.911 --> 37:15.678
Hey, I'm really sorry,

37:15.680 --> 37:19.315
uh, tonight's not
gonna work for me.

37:19.317 --> 37:23.019
They got us on doubles,
i-it's all hands on deck.

37:24.956 --> 37:27.657
Look, it's my job,

37:27.659 --> 37:30.860
and I told you it would
be this way, sometimes.

37:33.598 --> 37:35.798
Talk to you soon.

37:39.637 --> 37:42.004
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

37:42.006 --> 37:43.406
I work here.

37:43.408 --> 37:46.008
Yeah, I meant, uh, I thought
you had a thing with Barry.

37:46.010 --> 37:47.944
He canceled.

37:47.946 --> 37:49.312
What, an hour before?

37:49.314 --> 37:51.080
Something came up.

37:51.082 --> 37:54.383
Ah, well, sorry to hear.

37:54.385 --> 37:56.652
You got plans?

37:56.654 --> 37:59.055
Uh, yeah, to not
be second fiddle.

37:59.057 --> 38:00.756
Hey.

38:00.758 --> 38:03.059
You're not.

38:04.929 --> 38:08.130
Seriously, I think it's...

38:09.901 --> 38:14.537
...it's not good for me
or you and Barry.

38:16.841 --> 38:20.042
All right, I lied.

38:21.579 --> 38:24.046
Barry didn't cancel, I did.

38:25.750 --> 38:27.316
Why?

38:27.318 --> 38:31.287
'Cause this week's been
kind of emotional.

38:31.289 --> 38:35.091
He wouldn't get it, you would.

38:36.327 --> 38:39.195
We went through it together.

38:39.197 --> 38:41.430
Geez.
(laughs softly)

38:42.901 --> 38:46.302
If we do go, we got to talk
about it the whole time?

38:46.304 --> 38:48.204
No.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.706
Okay.

38:50.708 --> 38:51.974
What do you feel like?

38:51.976 --> 38:55.111
Whatever you feel like.

38:55.113 --> 38:58.314
As long as it's Thai
or Vietnamese.

39:08.493 --> 39:09.825
Dinner.

39:10.862 --> 39:12.361
Put that away, please.

39:12.363 --> 39:13.229
Yeah, I'm almost done.

39:13.231 --> 39:14.297
You, too, Nicky,
put that away.

39:14.299 --> 39:15.298
Just a sec.

39:15.300 --> 39:16.365
It can wait.

39:16.367 --> 39:17.466
No, it actually can't wait.

39:17.468 --> 39:19.535
Routing planes at JFK?

39:19.537 --> 39:20.670
HENRY: I
thought we had

39:20.672 --> 39:22.204
this ironclad agreement
that you could not

39:22.206 --> 39:24.340
bring those things
to family dinner.

39:24.342 --> 39:25.274
I'm almost done.

39:25.276 --> 39:26.575
Nicky, now.

39:27.478 --> 39:28.577
You, too. Over and out.

39:28.579 --> 39:30.079
She's finally responding to me.

39:30.081 --> 39:31.347
Put it away.

39:31.349 --> 39:33.983
And who's responding
to you? Who's "she"?

39:33.985 --> 39:35.651
Jenna Garrity.

39:35.653 --> 39:36.886
Why is she finally
responding to you?

39:36.888 --> 39:38.287
Is she sending a
restraining order?

39:38.289 --> 39:40.022
Sean...
(laughter)

39:40.024 --> 39:41.290
Zip it.

39:41.292 --> 39:43.859
I just saw Grandpa
checking his phone.

39:43.861 --> 39:45.461
JAMIE:
Well,

39:45.463 --> 39:46.796
slight difference:
he is the police commissioner

39:46.798 --> 39:48.597
of New York City,
responsible for the safety

39:48.599 --> 39:49.865
of ten million people.

39:49.867 --> 39:52.168
And even still, he barely uses
his phone at the table.

39:52.170 --> 39:53.536
Thank you.

39:53.538 --> 39:54.937
You're welcome.
HENRY: I think we should

39:54.939 --> 39:57.373
all go back to writing letters
and postcards.

39:57.375 --> 39:58.574
I mean, call me
a Luddite,

39:58.576 --> 40:00.242
but I used to think we were

40:00.244 --> 40:01.877
much more
civilized, back then.

40:01.879 --> 40:04.313
I agree, but I don't know
what a Luddite is.

40:04.315 --> 40:05.448
ERIN: I think
it's a little late

40:05.450 --> 40:07.083
to put that genie
back in the bottle.

40:07.085 --> 40:08.651
Yeah, well, they're not
all bad, you know.

40:08.653 --> 40:11.387
Well, any great invention
can get hijacked,

40:11.389 --> 40:13.990
or have its positives twisted.

40:13.992 --> 40:15.291
JAMIE: A
little extreme,

40:15.293 --> 40:17.193
- Dad, no?
- No.

40:17.195 --> 40:18.761
A phone is a phone is a phone.

40:18.763 --> 40:20.062
Unless it is an addiction.

40:20.064 --> 40:21.097
(scoffs)
Or a sad

40:21.099 --> 40:24.400
substitute for actual
human contact,

40:24.402 --> 40:26.202
or worse.

40:26.204 --> 40:28.637
Well, you might be reaching
for the fences on that one, Dad.

40:28.639 --> 40:32.008
Okay, can anyone tell me
a great story in your life

40:32.010 --> 40:34.410
that started with
"so-and-so was texting me

40:34.412 --> 40:36.312
and so-and-so texted me back"?

40:36.314 --> 40:37.413
(laughs)

40:37.415 --> 40:39.482
He's got a good point, there.
Mm. Yeah.

40:39.484 --> 40:40.616
Thank you.
HENRY: Which is why

40:40.618 --> 40:42.051
we ban them

40:42.053 --> 40:44.987
at this table, at least.

40:44.989 --> 40:45.888
I agree.

40:45.890 --> 40:47.690
Mm-hmm. Guys.
Me, too.

40:47.692 --> 40:49.191
(scoffs)
Is that a real question?

40:49.193 --> 40:50.493
- No. - No.
- No.

40:50.495 --> 40:52.628
Well, the noes have it.

40:52.630 --> 40:53.596
Clearly.

40:53.598 --> 40:55.131
Hmm. Grace?

40:55.133 --> 40:56.532
Good call, Pop.

40:58.536 --> 40:59.969
Bless us, O Lord...

40:59.971 --> 41:01.370
and these Thy gifts,

41:01.372 --> 41:04.073
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty.

41:04.075 --> 41:05.641
Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
