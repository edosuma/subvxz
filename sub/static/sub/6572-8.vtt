00:02.068 --> 00:05.401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.285 --> 00:22.584
<i>Michael was trying to include
his brother in the business...</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:25.249
<i>at his father's request...</i>

00:25.358 --> 00:28.225
So, the last couple of months
have seen us hemorrhaging money...

00:28.328 --> 00:32.628
<i>But he was finding himself
overwhelmed by the change.</i>

00:32.732 --> 00:35.064
Is it my turn to speak yet?
I've got a good one.

00:35.168 --> 00:37.864
- We're gonna wait till after lunch for the tricks.
- It's not a trick, Michael.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.769
It's a business opportunity.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.104
You can turn the music off.
I already shot my wad.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.109
Off.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.702
No, that's tape. It's a...

00:47.814 --> 00:51.614
I have got a quick way for us...

00:51.718 --> 00:54.619
to literally be showered with money.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.588
That's where the penny thing would have...

01:00.393 --> 01:02.725
Bonus. Anyway, it involves
us making some money...

01:02.829 --> 01:05.388
with our Mexican friends from Colombia.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.295
I think they're called Colombians.

01:07.400 --> 01:12.064
Oh, I forgot. We're being "politically correct."

01:12.172 --> 01:15.005
Anyway, there's a company there that
wants to develop some time-shares with us.

01:15.108 --> 01:17.474
I told them that we'll
sell them our blueprints...

01:17.577 --> 01:20.774
- for 100 grand.
- Gob, we're prohibited...

01:20.880 --> 01:23.440
from doing any business outside the
country while we're under investigation.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.575
Translation: "Wish I'd thought of that."

01:25.685 --> 01:28.085
- Nice translating, Dad.
- Oh.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.213
I also had this slogan made up.

01:30.323 --> 01:33.588
"A Colombian cartel that <i>won't</i>
kidnap and kill you."

01:33.693 --> 01:36.321
Underline "won't," 'cause
that makes the competition look like...

01:36.429 --> 01:38.329
- maybe they...
- I'm serious. We're not doing it.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.696
It's illegal, and, uh, it's also kind
of a stupid way to make a quick buck.

01:41.801 --> 01:44.793
- It's not stupid. You're stupid.
- Nice pout, Dad.

01:44.904 --> 01:47.566
I wasn't calling you stupid.
I was calling the idea stupid.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.574
If you'd spend a little more time
learning about the business...

01:49.676 --> 01:51.837
and less time with the tricks,
you'd know that.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.539
If I didn't have a live dove
in my pants right now...

01:54.647 --> 01:58.139
I would leap across this table and...
You know what? Forget it.

01:58.251 --> 02:00.549
- Let's go ahead and take five.
<i>- Michael was frustrated...</i>

02:00.653 --> 02:04.180
<i>and returned to his office to find Lindsay.</i>

02:04.290 --> 02:06.690
Gob is driving me crazy. I finally
got rid of him for a little while...

02:06.793 --> 02:08.693
and Dad put him
right back in the business.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.695
You two have always fought.

02:10.797 --> 02:14.130
- I think I even have video of that.
- You and half of Orange County.

02:14.234 --> 02:17.965
<i>As children, George Sr. would
often provoke the boys to fight one another.</i>

02:18.071 --> 02:19.971
He's calling you a liar.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.041
I don't want your cards, Michael.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.906
<i>He believed it created a competitive spirit...</i>

02:25.011 --> 02:27.241
<i>which equipped them for the challenges of life.</i>

02:27.347 --> 02:29.247
Let's keep it in frame.

02:29.349 --> 02:32.250
<i>He also believed footage
of the tussles would be a big hit...</i>

02:32.352 --> 02:34.912
<i>in the burgeoning
home video market.</i>

02:35.021 --> 02:38.650
<i>He soon franchised the concept
with such titles...</i>

02:38.758 --> 02:42.159
<i>as</i> Boyfights 2...

02:42.262 --> 02:44.196
A Boyfights Cookout...

02:44.297 --> 02:49.098
<i>and</i> Backseat Boyfights:
The Trip to Uncle Jack’s 70th.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.830
- How do you think I feel?
- You weren't even in the tapes.

02:51.938 --> 02:55.339
I was talking about my marriage.
Are we still talking about the tapes?

02:55.441 --> 02:57.170
Apparently not.
What's going on with your marriage?

02:57.277 --> 03:01.839
Well, as you know, Bob Loblaw and I
have had a secret little thing going.

03:01.948 --> 03:05.748
- Very secret. He doesn't know.
- He has not known of it. That's correct.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.515
But last night he finally
responded to one of my little hints.

03:09.622 --> 03:11.749
- Why won't you !@%$ me?
- Look...

03:11.858 --> 03:15.521
You're an attractive woman, and you've
been dressing like a common whore.

03:15.628 --> 03:19.291
- Well, I've been trying. - But you asked
me to represent you in your divorce.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.891
- I can't see a client.
- Then recommend somebody else.

03:23.002 --> 03:24.902
Well, our copy boy is very striking...

03:25.004 --> 03:26.904
but he often has toner on his fingers.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.873
- I meant another lawyer.
- Oh.

03:29.976 --> 03:33.377
So now I have to tell Tobias we're getting
divorced, break the news to Maeby...

03:33.479 --> 03:35.947
plus fit an eyebrow pluck in there,
all before the weekend.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.574
Perhaps you can talk to Maeby while
you're getting your eyebrows plucked.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.779
It'll look like your eyes
are watering 'cause you're sad.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.482
<i>Later that day Michael
went to his parents’ apartment...</i>

03:44.591 --> 03:47.924
<i>to talk about the problem
he was having with Gob.</i>

03:48.027 --> 03:50.427
- What's going on here?
- They're painting the whole building...

03:50.530 --> 03:52.555
so I'm having the inside done too.

03:52.665 --> 03:57.899
And that goes into storage, right?
Not into your apartment.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.495
What's Spanish for
"I know you speak English"?

04:00.607 --> 04:02.507
Mom, if you're gonna speak
to these guys like this...

04:02.609 --> 04:04.509
you might want to sleep
with one eye open.

04:04.611 --> 04:07.478
Actually, I'll be sleeping at your place.

04:07.580 --> 04:11.277
- Paint fumes are deadly.
- You know Dad's under house arrest here.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.284
It'll be nice to get
a break from him too.

04:13.386 --> 04:16.321
Besides, I certainly
can't recuperate here.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.721
- Recuperate?
- I didn't want to worry anyone.

04:19.826 --> 04:23.284
It's a routine procedure...
Very common for women my age.

04:23.396 --> 04:26.854
I see. The apartment's not
the only thing getting a face lift, huh?

04:26.966 --> 04:29.264
Hope you kept your punch cards.
You're about due for a free one.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.269
- We have to pay for the paint.
- No, no, no.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.362
You're not getting a centavo
until you finish all the work.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.771
You guys are both gonna be
sleeping with your eyes open.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.843
Mom, however, will not have a choice.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.844
Dad, need you to help me get rid of Gob.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.347
- That ship sailed 35 years ago.
- Doesn't know anything about the business.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.883
Today he suggested that we do
an illegal Colombian deal.

04:45.985 --> 04:49.182
- You said that was legal.
- That was your idea?

04:49.289 --> 04:53.316
- I may have mentioned it.
- You told Gob to do it, didn't you?

04:53.426 --> 04:55.326
Did you just want to get us
at each other's throats again...

04:55.428 --> 04:58.295
- like you used to do with the <i>Boyfights</i> videos?
<i>- Boyfights?</i>

04:58.398 --> 05:01.128
<i>- Luchas de Muchachos.</i>
- Oh, sí, <i>Luchas de Muchachos.</i>

05:01.234 --> 05:03.634
- We had this video.
- Sí.

05:03.736 --> 05:05.533
<i>The tapes were a big hit in Latin America.</i>

05:05.638 --> 05:07.868
Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with them...

05:07.974 --> 05:09.965
Except for some
of the Baby Buster shorts.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.976
Maybe I was trying
to teach you something.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.978
Maybe I was trying
to teach you how to compete.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.015
I didn't do it with Buster,
and look how he turned out.

05:17.116 --> 05:20.483
- Is Buster.
- Baby Buster.

05:20.586 --> 05:23.578
"Yo quiero leche.
Yo quiero leche de madre."

05:23.690 --> 05:26.158
Even though I am so old.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.250
Those tapes made quite
an impression on these painters.

05:28.361 --> 05:31.159
I think I turned out
pretty darn well, myself.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.164
Oh, you just turned out great.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.996
I used my contacts
to get you a job, and you quit.

05:36.102 --> 05:39.299
<i>The job was at an Iraqi-owned toy store...</i>

05:39.405 --> 05:42.067
<i>that was hoping
to deter shoplifting.</i>

05:42.175 --> 05:46.168
Okay, I'll just take off
this cheap fake hand...

05:46.279 --> 05:48.907
and we gonna put on this sign.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.074
Beautiful. You like?

05:51.184 --> 05:54.051
They only wanted me because
I had one hand...and I won't do it!

05:54.153 --> 05:56.553
- That's not the way Mother is raising me.
- Like I won't compete...

05:56.656 --> 06:00.615
with my older brother anymore,
despite the way Father raised me.

06:00.727 --> 06:04.595
- We'll show you. - Just like I showed
Mr. Al-Jibaaly Muhammed a-Abat.

06:04.697 --> 06:08.064
I stole this sign.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.362
Of course, I left my hand there also.

06:10.470 --> 06:14.566
<i>But FAO al-Jibaaly Muhammed a-Abat...</i>

06:14.674 --> 06:18.303
<i>wasn't the only one
having trouble scaring kids.</i>

06:18.411 --> 06:22.939
<i>So was Hollywood's third-youngest
movie studio executive, Maeby Fünke.</i>

06:23.049 --> 06:25.950
The creature's in your imagination.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.327
That's the bloodsucker? It looks like Alf.
You got a week to fix it.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.953
This must be the creature that ate our cat.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.496
<i>- And Michael met up with Gob.</i>
- Hey, Gob.

06:42.602 --> 06:45.400
Why didn't you tell me that
Colombian thing was Dad's idea?

06:45.505 --> 06:48.235
Well, Dad said not to
because you don't think I'm smart...

06:48.341 --> 06:50.741
- and that I should take credit for it.
- It was just Dad...

06:50.843 --> 06:53.744
trying to turn us against each other again,
and of course I think you're smart.

06:53.846 --> 06:56.076
Okay? Hey, what's going on
down there? What are you doing?

06:56.182 --> 06:58.241
You don't want a hungry dove
down your pants.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.649
That's how Tony Wonder lost a nut.

07:00.753 --> 07:04.348
Look, I know that I don't know
about this housing stuff...

07:04.457 --> 07:06.823
but I've got this
Christian girlfriend now...

07:06.926 --> 07:09.258
and she's trying to get me
to be a better man...

07:09.362 --> 07:11.262
and reconnect with my son...

07:11.364 --> 07:13.855
and I'm trying to get her
to renounce God and !@%$ me...

07:13.966 --> 07:17.868
and I just want to prove to her
that I'm worth it.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.961
As always, Gob, a mixed bag there...

07:20.072 --> 07:23.166
but the middle part sounded pretty admirable
for a second, so here's what I want to do.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.540
I want to get you your own
banana stand franchise...

07:25.645 --> 07:28.205
and you can have Steve work at it.

07:28.314 --> 07:31.977
- You'd do that for me?
- Yes. Yeah. You can design your own shack.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.642
- And choose my own location?
- Whatever you want.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.778
You're gonna be 100%
in charge, all right?

07:35.888 --> 07:38.288
But the most important thing
is that we never let Dad...

07:38.391 --> 07:42.293
- turn us against each other again.
- Thanks, Michael.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.834
If you feel something moving
down there, it's just the bird.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.803
I know it.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.841
<i>And a few days later...</i>

07:56.943 --> 07:59.002
<i>Michael got a call from his son.</i>

07:59.111 --> 08:01.875
- Hey, Dad, did you know Gob started
a banana stand? - Yeah, that was my idea.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.677
I'm trying to get us
to be less competitive.

08:04.784 --> 08:07.218
That's gonna be difficult.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.050
Plus they have a very aggressive slogan.

08:17.063 --> 08:20.794
<i>Gob had opened a new
frozen banana stand, like...</i>

08:20.900 --> 08:23.198
<i>twenty feet from the old
frozen banana stand.</i>

08:23.302 --> 08:25.964
What's going on? You just thought
you'd put the stand right here?

08:26.072 --> 08:28.302
Did the research. Do you know
that more frozen bananas are sold...

08:28.407 --> 08:30.705
right here on this boardwalk
than anywhere in the OC?

08:30.810 --> 08:33.039
- Don't call it that.
- Also gonna need a check, 'cause I kind of went...

08:33.145 --> 08:36.046
out of pocket on the new sign... and
I need some bananas and some chocolate...

08:36.148 --> 08:38.173
- from the other branch. - Just take
the sign down... Take the whole booth down.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.717
You're cannibalizing our business.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.254
You're just scared
of a little "competish."

08:43.356 --> 08:45.586
You guys don't even have bananas,
so I'm not too worried.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.888
In fact, you know what? Me and my son
are gonna kick your little shack's ass.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.327
Dad, it's okay. We can just work
together with them, you know?

08:51.430 --> 08:54.331
That makes sense. I mean, we
don't really even know the recipe.

08:54.433 --> 08:57.891
- You just freeze the banana,
and then you stick it... - Don't tell 'em.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.904
- Stick it in the what?
- No, it's okay. We'll figure it out.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.201
And when we do,
we'll have the last laugh.

09:02.308 --> 09:06.108
We'll be the laughingstock
of the boardwalk.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.841
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay was
preparing for her own competition.</i>

09:09.949 --> 09:12.349
This is Treat. He'll be representing you.

09:12.451 --> 09:15.352
He started off as my paralegal,
but he's a lawyer now.

09:15.454 --> 09:18.184
- Well, as of next Monday.
- Well, we'll fudge that.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.918
Lindsay, just do me one favor.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.824
Don't mention me by name when you
talk about your future plans for dating.

09:22.929 --> 09:25.022
It reflects poorly on me.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.531
Right, right.
The conflict of interest.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.863
Yeah, that too.

09:29.969 --> 09:33.302
- Hello, Lindsay.
- Tobias. Did you get a lawyer?

09:33.406 --> 09:37.206
Only the best-looking and
best-educated lawyer in the whole OC.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.210
- Don't call it that.
- Okay.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.076
- Bob Loblaw. How are you?
- Bob's representing you?

09:42.181 --> 09:45.947
<i>He was. One day earlier,
Tobias had spoken to him...</i>

09:46.052 --> 09:48.885
<i>- on the phone.</i> - Whether or not
those promises were made explicit.

09:48.988 --> 09:53.482
You... want me to be explicit?

09:53.593 --> 09:55.493
Anyway, as it turns out...

09:55.595 --> 09:58.826
Bob was offering to be my lawyer.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.831
<i>And that night...</i>

10:00.933 --> 10:04.664
<i>- Buster arrived with a post-op Lucille.</i>
- There she is.

10:04.770 --> 10:08.399
She wants to know where you want to put her.

10:08.507 --> 10:10.634
She can take my room.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.438
She wants to know
if I can sleep there too.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.173
She said that's very important to her.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.250
All right. I'll meet you
up there, Mother.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.284
You better not lock it!
I'll kick it in!

10:25.391 --> 10:28.690
Oh, by the way. Doctor said
no kissing her on the face for one week.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.854
I was like, "Make it two weeks.
See if I care."

10:31.964 --> 10:34.432
Got a new hand?

10:34.533 --> 10:36.592
Oh, yeah. I'm trying it out.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.932
Guess who I ran into at the prosthetic
shop while I was waiting for Mother.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.938
Sorry, no refunds...

10:41.040 --> 10:46.307
- And that's why you don't take your foot
out of its wrapper. - J. Walter Weatherman.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.210
You're the man who used to scare us
as children, and one time as an adult.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.943
<i>George Sr. had always used him...</i>

10:52.051 --> 10:54.349
<i>to teach his children
lasting lessons.</i>

10:54.453 --> 10:58.856
<i>They usually involved
his prosthetic arm being ripped off.</i>

10:58.958 --> 11:04.794
And that's why you always leave a note.

11:04.897 --> 11:07.832
- You're one of George Bluth's kids.
- Uh-huh.

11:07.933 --> 11:11.460
- I guess you'll be scaring children yourself now.
- As a matter of fact, I won't.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.902
If anything, it
strengthened my resolve...

11:14.006 --> 11:16.406
to be more than just
a one-armed man...

11:16.509 --> 11:18.977
Even if it means me never
taking a job again.

11:21.413 --> 11:23.314
Almost makes it worth it.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.179
- Hello.
<i>- Listen. I heard...</i>

11:25.284 --> 11:27.809
that you gave Gob
a banana stand.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.354
<i>They did great.
He and Steve took in over $700.</i>

11:30.456 --> 11:32.356
- They did?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

11:32.458 --> 11:34.892
So I guess the Bluth Company's
got a new heir.

11:34.994 --> 11:38.862
<i>That's when Michael
realized it was time to get serious.</i>

11:38.964 --> 11:42.092
George Michael, do you know
where the banana suit is?

11:44.770 --> 11:48.706
<i>That night,
Maeby, displaced by Buster, heard a noise.</i>

11:51.143 --> 11:53.510
Hello? George Michael?

11:54.613 --> 11:57.014
I'm thirsty.

11:58.117 --> 12:00.278
<i>And Maeby knew she had found
her bloodsucking creature.</i>

12:02.021 --> 12:06.549
<i>The next day, Michael took
off work to man the banana stand...</i>

12:06.659 --> 12:09.890
<i>- while his son manned a banana.</i>
- How you doin' there, champ?

12:09.995 --> 12:13.431
- Is my name champ? It's so hot.
- Why don't you take five?

12:13.532 --> 12:15.796
That's not including the five minutes
it takes to get out of this thing?

12:15.901 --> 12:17.801
- You're not getting out of it.
- Attention, everyone.

12:17.903 --> 12:22.533
Why go to a banana stand when
we can make <i>your</i> banana stand?

12:22.641 --> 12:25.235
I give you Barbara and Dee.

12:28.180 --> 12:31.274
Don't worry. These young beauties have
been nowhere near the bananas.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.283
Dad, are they strippers?

12:33.385 --> 12:36.650
If I know your uncle, they're at least
strippers. I guess we gotta up the ante.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.453
No, Dad. Then they're just gonna up it
and it'll go back and forth all day.

12:40.559 --> 12:43.653
- If that's what it takes, that's what
we're gonna do. <i>- And they did...</i>

12:43.763 --> 12:47.221
<i>But it was less entertaining
than you might imagine...</i>

12:48.868 --> 12:51.098
<i>no matter what music
was put under it.</i>

13:07.520 --> 13:10.011
<i>It was kind of funny
to "Yellow Submarine"...</i>

13:10.122 --> 13:12.920
<i>but who could afford it?</i>

13:15.594 --> 13:17.960
<i>So here's what happened at the end.</i>

13:18.063 --> 13:19.598
- Hey, stop fighting!
- Stop it!

13:19.598 --> 13:20.656
- Hey, stop fighting!
- Stop it!

13:20.766 --> 13:23.326
That's it. They're right, okay? This is insane.
We're just "boyfighting" again.

13:23.435 --> 13:26.427
And for what?
A hefty bag full of pesos.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.599
- You've been taking pesos?
- Dad said I should.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.438
- Dad's involved with this?
- Well, he chose the location...

13:32.545 --> 13:35.446
And the strippers and the sign.
Every part of it, really.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.641
Wait a minute. Don't you see
what's happening here?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.650
Dad's clearly going ahead
with the Colombian deal...

13:39.752 --> 13:41.652
and he's laundering it
through your banana shack.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.779
He pitted us against each other
so I'd be too busy to notice.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.323
Well, you know what? I think it's
time for us to teach Dad a lesson.

13:46.425 --> 13:49.451
Get the person who terrorized us
the most in our childhood.

13:49.562 --> 13:53.020
She's still healing.
Let's get J. Walter Weatherman.

13:59.972 --> 14:02.031
<i>Michael and Gob had decided...</i>

14:02.141 --> 14:04.109
<i>to teach their father a lesson.</i>

14:04.210 --> 14:07.111
- We need the number of the one-armed man.
- I'm not giving you that.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.704
You want to use his disability
to scare someone.

14:09.815 --> 14:13.046
That's everything I'm against.
Read the button, mister!

14:15.020 --> 14:17.853
"The only scary thing about...

14:17.957 --> 14:20.357
a one-armed man trying to
scare someone is the fact that"...

14:20.459 --> 14:23.223
That he feels that his one arm is good
for nothing but trying to scare somebody.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.058
- It's upside down.
- Let's see you try to put a button on...

14:25.164 --> 14:27.291
with this.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.060
Stop screaming.
It's not scary.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.068
I'm gonna get the number myself,
'cause we're not gonna...

14:31.170 --> 14:33.070
go through our lives
being controlled by this guy.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.231
What is more pathetic than grown men
being scared of their father?

14:35.341 --> 14:38.071
- I'm thirsty.
- Oh, my God!

14:39.345 --> 14:42.075
<i>This continued for a while.</i>

14:42.181 --> 14:44.809
<i>And later, Michael and Gob
went to put their plan in action.</i>

14:44.917 --> 14:46.885
I gave the Colombians back
their money, and I told them...

14:46.986 --> 14:49.113
that you had no right
to make the deal.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.155
I have to warn you, though,
they didn't sound too happy.

14:51.257 --> 14:53.725
Let's just hope they don't try to get
even by "cir-sum-venting" the law.

14:53.826 --> 14:57.125
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Kidnap or... Michael said it.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.595
What, are you kidding?
I have an ankle monitor.

14:59.698 --> 15:01.791
I can't even go into the hallway
without the cops coming up.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.801
- Stop it!
- Clearly you know what you're doing.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.066
There's an off chance they might
just want to take you, leave the ankle.

15:07.172 --> 15:09.697
But anyhow...
Stall him.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.606
<i>And Michael
went to solicit help for the lesson.</i>

15:12.711 --> 15:14.906
How would you and some
of your friends like to help us...

15:15.014 --> 15:16.982
teach Mr. Bluth a lesson?

15:17.082 --> 15:18.982
Maybe pose as Colombians.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.575
But we are Guatemalan.
Won't he know the difference?

15:21.687 --> 15:24.247
I think anything south
of San Diego will be just fine.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.587
- Orlando was in the Groundlings.
- Just classes.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.253
Is it going to be unscripted, like <i>Curb?</i>

15:30.362 --> 15:34.264
<i>George Sr., meanwhile,
had grown suspicious of his sons.</i>

15:34.366 --> 15:36.596
What was that with Michael just now?

15:36.702 --> 15:39.603
He wants to teach you a lesson.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.832
- What kind of lesson?
- J. Walter Weatherman lesson.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.501
He's gonna fake your kidnapping
and helicopter ride to Colombia.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.511
He's gonna teach me a lesson
using my own scare toy?

15:47.613 --> 15:49.945
Weatherman wouldn't do it.
I think Buster turned him.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.949
Yeah, well, he'll say yes for me.

15:52.051 --> 15:55.111
We'll go along with his lesson, but
we're gonna teach him one of our own...

15:55.220 --> 15:58.678
But it's gotta be a secret, okay?
Between a dad and his...

15:58.791 --> 16:01.521
His favorite son.

16:04.630 --> 16:08.999
- Don't worry, Pop. Gob Bluth doesn't cave.
- Yeah, you just did for me.

16:09.101 --> 16:11.535
- Well, you asked me to so I thought...
- Okay, go, go, go. It's fine.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.868
<i>And Lindsay and Tobias
were back with the arbitrator.</i>

16:14.974 --> 16:16.908
As you know, it is very difficult...

16:17.009 --> 16:20.069
to establish fault in a divorce,
but one indicator is fidelity.

16:20.179 --> 16:23.876
My client has not pursued sex
outside of this marriage.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.178
- Nor in it.
- I got this one.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.310
- Can the same be said for you?
- Oh, absolutely.

16:28.420 --> 16:31.253
- I've done everything to make this marriage work.
- That's interesting.

16:31.357 --> 16:33.825
Can you tell me what your
plans are for this evening?

16:33.926 --> 16:36.724
Uh, I have plans with a friend.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.559
- A man? What's his name, please?
- Don't answer that.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.725
I withdraw the question.
Why don't we stop for the day?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.860
So <i>Mrs.</i> Fünke...

16:44.970 --> 16:46.938
can get to her date
with her mysterious...

16:47.039 --> 16:49.507
Mr. Blah-blah-blah.

16:49.608 --> 16:52.543
At 8:30, unless you want
to sit at the bar.

16:52.644 --> 16:54.839
<i>It was the first time
someone took Tobias's side...</i>

16:54.947 --> 16:58.678
<i>- and he wanted to thank him.</i>
- As much as I hate losing Lindsay and everything...

16:58.784 --> 17:01.082
I feel like I'm making
a friend in you...

17:01.186 --> 17:03.711
so I was wondering if maybe
tonight you just want to...

17:03.822 --> 17:05.722
take in a movie... or a <i>schvitz...</i>

17:05.824 --> 17:07.883
or just stay in and nest.

17:07.992 --> 17:11.053
Actually, I was going to stay in my
office tonight and work on my law blog.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.529
Of course...
The Bob Loblaw Law Blog.

17:13.632 --> 17:16.692
Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful.

17:16.801 --> 17:21.204
<i>While Tobias was trying
to get his mouth around Bob Loblaw...</i>

17:21.306 --> 17:24.742
<i>Maeby was showing Mort Meyers
a monster of her own.</i>

17:24.843 --> 17:26.742
Oh, that's terrifying.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.972
Who did that for you,
Industrial Light & Magic?

17:29.081 --> 17:31.879
- Topelson Plastic and Silicone.
- Did he do <i>Land of the Dead?</i>

17:31.984 --> 17:34.544
Yeah. He's been
in Beverly Hills for years.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.281
- Get our makeup people on it.
<i>- And George Sr. waited...</i>

17:37.389 --> 17:40.324
<i>for the fake kidnapping
he knew Michael had orchestrated.</i>

17:42.428 --> 17:45.920
- Don't move!
- Hey, well, let's do it.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.931
Get into the box, old man.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.933
Oh, blankets. That's...
Who thought of that?

17:50.035 --> 17:52.469
- That is very nice.
- Come on, get in the trunk!

17:52.571 --> 17:54.971
What about...
What about my ankle monitor?

17:55.074 --> 17:57.338
We have an ankle monitor deactivator.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.343
Oh, good. See, I've been
meaning to get one of those.

17:59.445 --> 18:03.176
I'm not gonna resist you guys because,
you know, I don't want you to beat me.

18:03.282 --> 18:05.307
<i>But the mistreated painters...</i>

18:05.417 --> 18:07.476
<i>were actually looking forward to that part.</i>

18:07.586 --> 18:10.050
Oh! Forgot my iPod.

18:16.562 --> 18:20.692
- Start the helicopter!
<i>- And so Michael, believing himself...</i>

18:20.799 --> 18:24.929
<i>to be aided by Gob, set to work.</i>

18:25.037 --> 18:28.302
<i>But this too produced
less-than-compelling footage.</i>

18:37.082 --> 18:39.214
<i>And this is how that ended.</i>

18:39.318 --> 18:41.115
Put on the sound effects.
Put on the sound effects.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.211
CD... CD one. CD one.

18:43.822 --> 18:46.052
Track two. Track two.

18:46.358 --> 18:48.353
Put the hostage here by the ottoman.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.553
Get it out of here.
What's it doing in here?

18:50.662 --> 18:53.495
- Ottoman out.
<i>- And George Sr. was released...</i>

18:53.599 --> 18:56.568
<i>- from his long journey into the living room.</i>
- Where am I?

18:56.668 --> 18:59.899
- Colombia. Where do you think?
- And you just missed the last train...

19:00.005 --> 19:02.496
that will come through
the jungle for three days.

19:02.608 --> 19:04.576
- He's good.
- He's a Groundling.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.371
You have betrayed us,
and we will make you pay...

19:06.478 --> 19:09.743
- and then we will go back for your sons.
- My sons? No.

19:09.848 --> 19:13.147
They too will suffer
for your terrible decisions.

19:13.252 --> 19:15.186
And you should really
pay your workers what they deserve...

19:15.287 --> 19:17.187
not make them have to buy
their own supplies.

19:17.289 --> 19:19.086
Not just the painting.
The sanding too.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.819
Yeah, and the taping
is very time-consuming.

19:21.927 --> 19:25.693
<i>Michael decided
his father was ready to learn his lesson.</i>

19:25.797 --> 19:27.526
- And that is why...
- He's got a gun!

19:27.633 --> 19:30.029
I can't let you do it! Get away!

19:30.435 --> 19:33.734
Get away. I'll shoot. I will, I will.
I'll take you all out.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.672
- This is all fake. These guys are painters.
- I will, I will!

19:36.775 --> 19:41.337
- Oh, God! My arm.
- Dad, you just shot off this guy...

19:41.446 --> 19:43.346
This guy's arm.

19:43.448 --> 19:47.441
And that's why you don't
teach your father a lesson.

19:47.553 --> 19:51.114
Who's the stupid one now?
Thank you, Gob.

19:51.223 --> 19:54.522
Gob? You told him?
I thought we were a team.

19:54.626 --> 19:58.062
- It's not fun feeling stupid, is it?
- You son of a...

20:00.299 --> 20:02.699
- Wait a minute. I gotta get my camera.
- Get off of me!

20:02.801 --> 20:05.201
What is all this?
What's going on?

20:05.304 --> 20:07.363
Keep it in frame.
You wanna... Cheat out.

20:07.472 --> 20:09.531
- I will kill you!
- I'm gonna kill you.

20:09.641 --> 20:11.541
- You're going out of frame.
- I'll kill you.

20:11.943 --> 20:13.735
No!

20:13.845 --> 20:16.109
Oh, my God! Michael!

20:16.615 --> 20:20.982
Dad... It was an accident. I'm sorry.

20:21.086 --> 20:24.715
And that's why you don't pit
Gob and me against each other.

20:24.823 --> 20:27.553
- Yes! Yeah!
- Gob.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.559
- You set me up.
- That's right.

20:29.661 --> 20:33.392
- No more "boyfights."
- J. Walter Weatherman was in on it too?

20:33.498 --> 20:35.762
- Right from the very start.
- So you did use him.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.961
Look at this place.
Look at my home.

20:39.071 --> 20:43.303
- Freeze! Drop the gun. - It's okay.
We're just trying to teach this guy a lesson.

20:43.408 --> 20:47.105
- Drop the gun!
- Oh, my good hand!

20:47.212 --> 20:49.237
<i>Buster's good hand just came...</i>

20:49.348 --> 20:51.680
flying off.

20:51.783 --> 20:56.777

one-armed person to scare someone.
