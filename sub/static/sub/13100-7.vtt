00:01.500 --> 00:03.708
[dramatic music]

00:24.917 --> 00:27.500
(male #1 over radio)
'Shuttle Dyson, you're our
last shuttle for today.'

00:27.583 --> 00:29.083
'Logging off for now.'

00:29.167 --> 00:30.500
'Please remind
your passengers about'

00:30.583 --> 00:32.667
'customs procedures
prior to debarkation.'

00:32.750 --> 00:35.708
(Dyson)
'Roger that, Babylon Control.
Have a nice day.'

00:46.250 --> 00:48.500
They're finally here, Jacque.

00:48.583 --> 00:50.625
[intense music]

00:54.000 --> 00:57.083
Okay, we all know
what we're here for, right?

00:57.167 --> 00:58.917
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

00:59.000 --> 01:01.208
As of 6:30 tomorrow morning

01:01.292 --> 01:03.500
Lieutenant J.G. David Corwin

01:03.583 --> 01:06.792
is promoted to full lieutenant.

01:06.875 --> 01:09.208
[all cheering]

01:09.292 --> 01:11.375
Congratulations.

01:13.375 --> 01:15.792
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.458
Next round
is on the house.

01:18.542 --> 01:19.833
[all cheering]

01:21.292 --> 01:23.333
Did you see the look
on his face?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.375
He hates being
the center of attention.

01:25.458 --> 01:28.958
Classic example of being caught
between fight and flight.

01:29.042 --> 01:31.708
Why does everything always have
to come down to biology?

01:31.792 --> 01:33.750
Because, no matter what you do
everything you comes down

01:33.833 --> 01:35.667
to one of two things,
biology or math.

01:35.750 --> 01:38.750
Please don't start him,
we'll be here for days.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.583
[chuckles]
Hey, by the way,
where's Marcus?

01:40.667 --> 01:42.042
I thought you were
gonna invite him.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.167
I just didn't think
it was appropriate.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.000
Earhart's is for Earthforce
personnel only.

01:46.083 --> 01:48.250
Come on, David invited
a bunch of civilians buddies

01:48.333 --> 01:51.000
who came over for the big night
who'd notice one more?

01:51.083 --> 01:53.167
- Marcus is one of us now--
- 'Is he?'

01:53.250 --> 01:55.417
I don't see an Earth Alliance
symbol on his chest

01:55.500 --> 01:57.917
or flight wings or..

01:58.000 --> 01:59.625
Look, I said I didn't think
it was appropriate

01:59.708 --> 02:01.833
and it was my call, okay?

02:01.917 --> 02:03.958
Does anybody at the table
have a problem with this?

02:04.042 --> 02:06.250
You know what,
she's right.

02:06.333 --> 02:09.583
Better off with Marcus
keeping a low profile right now.

02:11.167 --> 02:15.833
Well...here's to
our new lieutenant.

02:15.917 --> 02:18.292
And getting through
another day in one piece.

02:18.375 --> 02:22.542
May tomorrow be as quiet
and ordinary as today.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.583
Amen to that.

02:24.667 --> 02:26.958
Aah!

02:32.708 --> 02:34.208
[groaning]

02:36.208 --> 02:40.250
It's alright. Don't worry.
You'll be just fine.

02:40.333 --> 02:44.042
It'll be over soon.
Just try and relax.

02:44.125 --> 02:46.000
[screaming]

02:52.833 --> 02:55.833
[dramatic music]

03:14.833 --> 03:16.583
(female narrator)
The Babylon Project was our

03:16.667 --> 03:19.458
last best hope for peace.

03:22.792 --> 03:24.500
It failed.

03:24.583 --> 03:27.125
[theme music]

03:39.542 --> 03:41.250
But in the year
of the Shadow War

03:41.333 --> 03:43.833
it became something greater.

03:43.917 --> 03:45.792
Our last best hope

03:45.875 --> 03:47.750
for victory.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.917
The year is 2260.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.375
The place..

03:55.458 --> 03:57.625
...Babylon 5.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.875
[music continues]

04:21.583 --> 04:24.417
[music continues]

04:42.792 --> 04:45.125
[dramatic music]

04:52.167 --> 04:54.375
I don't understand.
What went wrong?

04:54.458 --> 04:56.708
- I don't know.
- Security's coming.

04:56.792 --> 04:59.042
They heard the screams.
We have to go.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.208
We can't just leave him.

05:00.292 --> 05:01.417
We don't have any other choice.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.625
We can't afford to be captured.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.458
Susan.

05:15.792 --> 05:16.958
Walk with me a minute.

05:17.042 --> 05:19.125
Sure.
It's all yours, lieutenant.

05:19.208 --> 05:20.792
Aye, commander.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.167
(Susan)
Is there a problem?

05:26.250 --> 05:28.417
That's what I want
you to find out.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.917
Now that Corwin's
been promoted

05:31.000 --> 05:33.167
sooner or later, he's gonna
end up getting in our business.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.583
You mean with Earth,
the president

05:34.667 --> 05:36.333
and the 10,000 ministries?

05:36.417 --> 05:38.583
Oh, he's due the promotion.
I don't begrudge him that.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.417
But he could be a problem
and I need to know

05:40.500 --> 05:43.958
where he stands.
If he can help us, great.

05:44.042 --> 05:45.500
'But, if you don't think
he's up for it'

05:45.583 --> 05:47.208
'then we have to keep him
out of the loop.'

05:47.292 --> 05:50.417
I suggest a private meeting.
Just talk to him.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.625
See what you can find out
without giving anything away.

05:52.708 --> 05:54.167
Will do.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.875
You know, this is the part
of all this I really hate.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.333
[indistinct chatter]

06:09.500 --> 06:12.042
[snoring]

06:20.500 --> 06:24.583
The gracious Duncan,
asleep by the gate.

06:24.667 --> 06:27.625
Me thinks I hear a voice cry,
sleep no more!

06:27.708 --> 06:29.542
Marcus does murder sleep.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.542
You're a madman,
you know.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.958
Such has been said

06:34.042 --> 06:35.375
but it was not I
who gifted you

06:35.458 --> 06:37.625
with so ominous
a name as Duncan.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.792
'Course, I doubt whether you've
ever read the Scottish play

06:39.875 --> 06:42.750
so the irony is lost.
Typical.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.458
You should watch your wares

06:47.542 --> 06:49.125
otherwise someone
might steal them out

06:49.208 --> 06:51.292
from under
your sleepy eyes.

06:51.375 --> 06:55.500
Why? None of it's worth buying,
much less stealing.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.375
Don't know why I
bother anymore.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.792
The thrill
of new encounters

07:00.875 --> 07:03.333
the bargaining,
the negotiations.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.292
The chance to catch
a little sleep until otherwise

07:05.375 --> 07:08.750
interrupted by madmen
who read too much.

07:09.958 --> 07:12.333
I don't think I like
the sound of that.

07:12.417 --> 07:14.833
Can't say I like it myself.

07:16.292 --> 07:18.500
Can't do much about it, either.

07:18.583 --> 07:19.833
I understand
there's a clinic--

07:19.917 --> 07:23.542
I don't like to be
poked by doctors.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.500
I'll be fine.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.167
How much for this one?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.833
The same as the piece
was yesterday

07:33.917 --> 07:36.000
and the day before that,
two credits.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.625
- You're a thief, a highwayman.
- Ha-ha-ha.

07:39.708 --> 07:42.750
The least you could do
is wear a mask and ride a horse.

07:45.625 --> 07:47.833
See you tomorrow.

07:47.917 --> 07:50.792
And Marcus...thanks.

07:53.833 --> 07:57.000
(Stephen)
And we expect fresh
blood supplies by Friday.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.917
Now, we're still
having a hard time

07:59.000 --> 08:00.625
getting Drazi blood
for transfusions

08:00.708 --> 08:03.375
so we're gonna have to stick
to the synthetics for now.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.542
Dr. Steinhoff,
Dr. Lieberman in Medlab Three

08:05.625 --> 08:07.208
is having some trouble
with a Brakiri.

08:07.292 --> 08:09.208
Now, you know their biology
better than anyone down there.

08:09.292 --> 08:11.792
Maybe you could
give him a hand? Good.

08:11.875 --> 08:14.542
Dr. Harrison, talk to me now.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.208
What's our status?

08:16.292 --> 08:18.458
We lost a Centauri patient
in Medlab Five.

08:18.542 --> 08:21.167
Chronic problems
with bicardial separation.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.917
There wasn't much we could do.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.625
Latest report from security show
the usual quota of injuries

08:25.708 --> 08:27.500
fight stabbings, nothing major.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.333
Good. Anything else?

08:29.417 --> 08:32.125
Well, got a DOA last night

08:32.208 --> 08:36.583
male human, no ID, mid 30s
no sign of injury or illness

08:36.667 --> 08:38.792
nothing to point to
as a cause of death.

08:38.875 --> 08:40.875
Dr. Morris wants you
to take a look at the body

08:40.958 --> 08:42.667
see if you can help him
figure out what to put

08:42.750 --> 08:44.083
on the death certificate.

08:44.167 --> 08:45.833
Alright, tell him to
bring the body by Medlab One

08:45.917 --> 08:48.333
this afternoon.
I'll take a look at it.

08:48.417 --> 08:50.000
That's it.
Let's go to work.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.708
Are you ready?

08:54.792 --> 08:57.333
[intense music]

09:01.833 --> 09:03.625
[whispering]

09:13.417 --> 09:15.667
What do you have for me?

09:15.750 --> 09:18.000
Message from Ranger One
on Minbar.

09:18.083 --> 09:20.333
He recommends our people go
on a heightened state of alert

09:20.417 --> 09:23.250
and pull back from Earth space.

09:23.333 --> 09:26.125
Word is something screwy's
going on back home.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.792
This is not exactly
a revelation.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.583
Anything else?

09:29.667 --> 09:31.208
Shadow vessels.

09:31.292 --> 09:34.292
They were sighted
in Sector 800 two days ago.

09:34.375 --> 09:37.042
Seems they're gathering,
creating a border

09:37.125 --> 09:39.583
on the edge of
Centauri space.

09:39.667 --> 09:44.542
Oh, and that package you've been
asking about, just left Mars.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.667
Should be here
in about a week.

09:46.750 --> 09:47.917
Alright.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.458
On your next supply run
I want you to make

09:49.542 --> 09:51.208
a quick side trip
through Sector 800

09:51.292 --> 09:54.000
and drop a long range
scanner and get out fast.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.708
Let's see if we can find out
what's going on out there.

10:05.458 --> 10:06.917
Anyone else?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
No. That was the last one.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.417
Good.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.125
Where's Samuel?

10:14.208 --> 10:16.542
My sources are used to
having him as my liaison

10:16.625 --> 10:18.292
and they don't react
well to change.

10:18.375 --> 10:21.417
He said he had more
important things to do.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.875
Did he? Strange.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.625
When I first enlisted him,
he said there was nothing

10:26.708 --> 10:30.042
more important
than our work here.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.083
I think I'll pay him a visit.

10:33.583 --> 10:36.125
[intense music]

10:40.250 --> 10:42.458
Computer, begin recording.

10:42.542 --> 10:45.250
Deceased is a human male,
age 35.

10:45.333 --> 10:50.000
Identified as having lived
in Downbelow since June of 2258.

10:52.333 --> 10:55.458
Toxicology scans indicate
the subject used a variety

10:55.542 --> 10:59.708
of controlled substances,
traces of dust, morphozine

10:59.792 --> 11:02.667
and others, but none
in sufficient quantities

11:02.750 --> 11:05.208
to cause death.

11:05.292 --> 11:08.625
No overt signs
of physical trauma.

11:10.917 --> 11:14.042
Scanners indicate heart,
lungs and other internal organs

11:14.125 --> 11:17.208
are all in fair condition.

11:17.292 --> 11:22.125
There are fingernail marks
in both palms.

11:22.208 --> 11:26.625
It appears they were caused by
the deceased clenching his fist.

11:28.167 --> 11:31.708
From the lividity of the skin,
I'd say they were made

11:31.792 --> 11:33.417
at time of death

11:33.500 --> 11:37.542
indicating the subject
was under a great deal of stress

11:37.625 --> 11:40.208
or fear.

11:40.292 --> 11:43.917
Shock may have been
a contributing factor.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.167
Contributing factor
to what, though?

11:46.250 --> 11:48.667
(automated message)
'Disease scan, negative.'

11:48.750 --> 11:51.958
'Blood tracking,
negative on all counts.'

11:52.042 --> 11:54.375
'Neural scan, one anomaly.'

11:54.458 --> 11:56.958
- 'Cardiovascular--'
- Wait a minute.

11:57.042 --> 11:58.750
Show me the anomaly.

12:02.042 --> 12:03.583
'What the hell is that?'

12:03.667 --> 12:05.625
(automated message)
'Unknown.'

12:09.208 --> 12:11.083
No sign of entry.

12:12.042 --> 12:13.750
Nothing on his record.

12:15.292 --> 12:18.125
'How did this end up wrapped
around his spinal column?'

12:18.208 --> 12:20.083
(automated message)
'Unknown.'

12:22.375 --> 12:23.958
I'm going to open him up.

12:24.042 --> 12:26.458
Stand by recording
while I prep.

12:28.875 --> 12:30.917
[dramatic music]

12:35.208 --> 12:37.125
Hello, Samuel.

12:38.917 --> 12:39.958
Marcus.

12:40.042 --> 12:42.792
I haven't seen you
in a few days.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.292
I've been busy.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.042
I can see you've made
some new friends.

12:48.125 --> 12:51.833
Good. Is everything alright?

12:51.917 --> 12:56.500
Fine. I just can't work
with you anymore.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.292
I have things to do now.

12:58.375 --> 13:01.042
Really?
What kind of things?

13:02.083 --> 13:04.625
[intense music]

13:06.417 --> 13:10.458
Yes. Well, I can see
you're busy, so I'll let you go.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.375
If there's
anything I can do.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.083
Thanks.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.583
I don't like it.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.917
I don't know what
but something's gotten into him.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.042
[dramatic music]

13:44.583 --> 13:46.917
Well, well..

13:47.000 --> 13:48.792
...what the hell are you?

13:53.375 --> 13:55.958
[man whimpering]

14:01.833 --> 14:03.583
[groaning]

14:06.583 --> 14:07.833
Closer examination confirms
that the biomass

14:07.917 --> 14:10.417
is 100 percent
genetically neutral.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.250
It can exist in any life form.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.583
What it's doing here,
I can't tell.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.875
It doesn't conform
to any known parasite.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.750
I've initiated
a background check to see

14:20.833 --> 14:22.417
if this is something the
deceased brought with him

14:22.500 --> 14:25.917
to the station
or if he was infested here.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.292
If it happened here,
we may have a problem.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.875
[indistinct chatter]

14:36.417 --> 14:39.458
[dramatic music]

14:45.083 --> 14:46.458
Excuse me.

14:46.542 --> 14:48.417
The fellow that normally
works that table, Duncan

14:48.500 --> 14:49.458
have you seen him?

14:49.542 --> 14:51.000
Yeah, just a little
while ago.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.333
He took all his stuff out,
said he was packing it in.

14:53.417 --> 14:56.167
Told Mackie to go ahead
and rent out his space.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.333
That doesn't make sense.

14:58.417 --> 15:02.292
He said he'd see me here
this morning.

15:02.375 --> 15:05.458
This is his,
his place.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.208
(female #1)
'Sorry. That's all I know.'

15:18.333 --> 15:19.583
[sighs]

15:23.250 --> 15:25.375
Quiet, isn't it, lieutenant?

15:26.333 --> 15:27.917
Yeah, a little.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.500
I like it
when it's quiet.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.667
It's a nice change of pace,
that's for sure.

15:31.750 --> 15:35.458
Listen, now that you've been
promoted, I was thinking

15:35.542 --> 15:38.333
we spend a lot of time
up here together but..

15:38.417 --> 15:40.792
...we never really
get a chance to talk.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.625
So, I was thinking maybe
we could get together

15:43.708 --> 15:46.458
and talk about what you see
yourself doing down the road.

15:46.542 --> 15:50.042
Just, you know, get to know
each other a little bit better.

15:51.583 --> 15:55.167
Well, uh, sure.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.833
We could,
I don't know..

15:57.917 --> 16:00.000
...meet in the mess hall
for breakfast.

16:00.083 --> 16:01.708
You can't have a private
conversation up there

16:01.792 --> 16:04.250
with dishes clattering,
people talking.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.625
So, why don't you come by
my quarters later in the day?

16:06.708 --> 16:10.000
We can have a cup of coffee,
real coffee.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.750
Just don't ask how I got it.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.750
And we can just talk
about stuff outside work

16:13.833 --> 16:16.542
you know, person to person.

16:16.625 --> 16:17.833
Okay.

16:19.292 --> 16:21.042
Uh, fine.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.375
- I'll be there.
- Good.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.375
(Marcus)
'I think we may
have a problem here.'

16:32.458 --> 16:35.375
Well, I wish I could see it,
but I don't.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.042
See people here
get flaky sometimes.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.583
Babylon 5 is like that.

16:38.667 --> 16:40.667
When you've been around longer,
you'll understand.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.375
I've been working with these
people for months now

16:42.458 --> 16:44.250
putting together
my network of contacts

16:44.333 --> 16:45.792
I know how they think.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.125
They wouldn't just
drop everything

16:47.208 --> 16:48.583
and change
their lives like this.

16:48.667 --> 16:51.250
Samuel wouldn't drop out
of sight without telling me an--

16:51.333 --> 16:52.917
No crime's been
committed here, Marcus.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.125
I've got nothing to go on.

16:55.208 --> 16:58.167
Nothing? Really?
How odd.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.292
All this time, I thought
I'd been expressing a rational

17:01.375 --> 17:03.750
and reasonable concern
about the fact that

17:03.833 --> 17:06.250
an increasingly large number
of people in Downbelow

17:06.333 --> 17:07.875
aren't acting normally.

17:07.958 --> 17:10.375
If they were normal,
they wouldn't be in Downbelow.

17:12.125 --> 17:14.458
Well, thank you,
Mr. Garibaldi

17:14.542 --> 17:17.250
one of the leading minds
of the 14th century.

17:17.333 --> 17:20.542
Have we no workhouses?
Have we no prisons?

17:20.625 --> 17:22.542
Mr. Marley here would
like a word with you.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.333
He's the fellow in the chains.

17:24.417 --> 17:27.125
Ignore the moans.
It's just gas.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.917
Don't you ever shut up?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.542
Not until I get what I want.

17:30.625 --> 17:33.958
Why? Do you think silent
meditation would work better?

17:36.583 --> 17:39.625
Ivanova's right,
you are a pain in the ass.

17:39.708 --> 17:43.250
All I'm asking is that you come
with me and look into it.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.958
- It'll take five minutes.
- Five minutes I don't have.

17:46.042 --> 17:47.500
Look, I'm sorry but until
somebody does something

17:47.583 --> 17:49.125
out of line,
it's not my business.

17:49.208 --> 17:50.875
Now, if your friends
are acting a little weird

17:50.958 --> 17:52.333
maybe they need
to talk to a doctor.

17:52.417 --> 17:54.458
But it's not my jurisdiction.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.875
- Can I quote you?
- Yeah, sure, whatever.

17:58.958 --> 18:01.833
So, Mr. Garibaldi suggested
that you come see me?

18:01.917 --> 18:03.792
Yes, he was quite
firm about it.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.667
Said he's up to his ears
and doesn't have five minutes

18:05.750 --> 18:08.125
to spare but you'd be perfect
for the job.

18:08.208 --> 18:12.500
His interest in this situation
is almost indescribable.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.875
Well, I'm sort of in the middle
of something right now.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.458
Won't take more than an hour.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.458
It'll take the computer
at least that long

18:21.542 --> 18:24.083
to finish the analysis. I guess
I could pop out for a bit.

18:25.167 --> 18:28.250
[instrumental music]

18:33.500 --> 18:35.417
Hi. Something I can
help you with?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.750
I don't know.
I was thinking...flowers?

18:37.833 --> 18:39.500
Thinking flowers is good.

18:39.583 --> 18:41.750
Giving flowers is better.
What's the occasion?

18:41.833 --> 18:44.042
I'm not sure
but I think I have a date.

18:44.125 --> 18:47.125
- She asked you out?
- She asked me in. Her place.

18:47.208 --> 18:50.083
- Moves fast. She aggressive?
- You could say that.

18:50.167 --> 18:53.500
- Ha-ha. Lucky guy.
- Oh, it's not like that.

18:53.583 --> 18:57.000
Well, it's not like that yet,
I think.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.917
You don't get out much,
do you, son?

18:59.000 --> 19:04.500
Well, I..
No, not really.

19:04.583 --> 19:09.625
Artificial roses.
Same smell. Same feel.

19:09.708 --> 19:11.917
Works every time.

19:13.542 --> 19:16.042
But what if it's not a date?
I don't want to offend her.

19:16.125 --> 19:21.042
Roses never offend a woman.
Except by their absence.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.958
That'll be 40 credits.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.833
Duncan!

19:26.917 --> 19:29.875
Duncan, if you're in there,
open up.

19:29.958 --> 19:32.167
You know,
maybe he went out.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.583
Look, are you
sure this is a good--

19:33.667 --> 19:35.417
He's an old man.
He hasn't been well.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.083
He could be sick
or injured.

19:38.167 --> 19:41.000
Well, in medical emergencies,
I can open the door and look

19:41.083 --> 19:42.583
but I can't
just walk in, though.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.708
Fine.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.250
Alright.

19:50.542 --> 19:52.417
- Hey, hey, I said--
- 'You said you couldn't go in.'

19:52.500 --> 19:54.458
'I don't have that problem.'

19:57.833 --> 20:00.083
'That's funny.
There's a..'

20:02.000 --> 20:05.125
Marcus?
You alright?

20:05.208 --> 20:07.833
(Marcus)
'I think you better come
and see this.'

20:08.875 --> 20:12.208
[intense music]

20:12.292 --> 20:13.292
Lights.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.250
(Marcus)
'They're out. Here.'

20:18.500 --> 20:20.125
What the..

20:24.667 --> 20:28.125
I told him.
No one ever listens.

20:28.208 --> 20:30.042
Hey! Hey, Marcus!

20:31.708 --> 20:34.250
[intense music]

20:51.917 --> 20:54.500
[groaning]

20:59.583 --> 21:03.375
- Jeez! Franklin to secur--
- Don't.

21:14.875 --> 21:17.000
(Franklin)
'That thing under his skin'

21:17.083 --> 21:20.083
'I found another one
just like it during an autopsy.'

21:20.167 --> 21:23.750
'Now, my guess is that it's
some kind of alien parasite'

21:23.833 --> 21:26.417
that burrows into
the spinal column

21:26.500 --> 21:28.542
and takes control
of the neural system.

21:28.625 --> 21:29.833
Now, if there are enough
of these things

21:29.917 --> 21:31.417
they could take over
the whole station

21:31.500 --> 21:33.167
before anyone knows
they're here.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.583
Point of logic.

21:34.667 --> 21:37.083
If that's true
then why take over lurkers?

21:37.167 --> 21:38.958
They're of no strategic value.

21:39.042 --> 21:41.083
They're not in a position
to take over the place

21:41.167 --> 21:42.500
no authority.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.458
I recognize the woman.

21:44.542 --> 21:48.042
'Jacque Lee,
a loner looking for a life.'

21:48.125 --> 21:49.583
'Classic lost soul.'

21:49.667 --> 21:51.875
Why them and not
some of the crew?

21:51.958 --> 21:54.000
For that matter,
why not you or me?

21:54.083 --> 21:56.875
Maybe they haven't
had a chance to until now.

21:56.958 --> 22:00.042
Maybe.
I'm not so sure.

22:01.375 --> 22:03.458
Well, we'd better try
and find out.

22:06.583 --> 22:09.625
Hey. That man is in pain.

22:13.625 --> 22:16.542
'Well, look, you can't
just leave him like that.'

22:19.000 --> 22:22.500
'That thing on his back,
did that happen to you too?'

22:24.333 --> 22:26.125
Listen to me.

22:26.208 --> 22:30.583
Whatever these creatures are,
they're controlling you.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.875
You've got to let us help you.

22:34.333 --> 22:36.125
Can you even understand me?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.542
[intense music]

22:45.125 --> 22:49.667
I am...was Matthew Duffin.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.625
I understand you.

22:51.708 --> 22:55.042
You will remain here
until we are finished.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.958
When we turn up missing,
people will come looking for us.

22:58.042 --> 23:00.542
Now, you cooperate,
we can try to work this out.

23:00.625 --> 23:03.375
If not, I can't
guarantee the safety

23:03.458 --> 23:05.333
of you or any of your people.

23:05.417 --> 23:08.250
And I cannot guarantee yours.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.042
[music continues]

23:16.208 --> 23:18.208
That went well.

23:18.292 --> 23:19.792
At least I'm trying
to do something.

23:19.875 --> 23:21.083
We've got to get out of here

23:21.167 --> 23:22.333
and tell the others
what's happening.

23:22.417 --> 23:25.083
- We will.
- How? How are we gonna do that?

23:25.167 --> 23:28.292
There are three of 'em with guns
against two of us with nothing.

23:28.375 --> 23:30.875
They'll cut us down before we
get half way across the room.

23:30.958 --> 23:33.208
All we need is for one of them
to leave the room.

23:33.292 --> 23:35.333
Then there'll be
only one man with a gun.

23:35.417 --> 23:37.958
[chuckles]
Excuse me?

23:38.042 --> 23:41.500
Where I come from,
one man from three leaves two.

23:41.583 --> 23:44.333
Where I come from is
a far more interesting place.

23:44.417 --> 23:46.000
Well, one good thing.

23:46.083 --> 23:47.625
At least Garibaldi knows
we're down here.

23:47.708 --> 23:50.167
If we don't turn up soon,
he'll know where to come look.

23:53.750 --> 23:58.333
Mr. Garibaldi does know
where we are, doesn't he?

23:58.417 --> 24:01.125
Not...as such, no.

24:02.583 --> 24:06.000
So no one knows
that anything's wrong.

24:06.083 --> 24:09.375
That would be
essentially correct, yes.

24:11.250 --> 24:14.458
Great. That's, that's great.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.833
[instrumental music]

24:28.208 --> 24:29.417
[beeping]

24:31.125 --> 24:32.542
Come.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.833
Where the hell
did those come from?

24:37.917 --> 24:40.292
- I, uh, I found them.
- Where?

24:40.375 --> 24:44.917
There. They were just,
you know, just lying there.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.375
Synthetic roses.

24:47.625 --> 24:49.833
Good ones.

24:49.917 --> 24:51.583
Whoever bought these
must have paid a lot for them.

24:51.667 --> 24:54.208
Yes, I imagine.

24:54.292 --> 24:56.667
Spending that kind of money
on high priced synthetics

24:56.750 --> 24:57.958
must be a real dope.

24:58.042 --> 25:00.292
Yes, I think so.

25:00.375 --> 25:04.417
It's showy, excessive,
not at all cost effective.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.667
And terribly romantic.

25:06.750 --> 25:11.583
Don't tell anybody but I've
always had a weakness for roses.

25:11.667 --> 25:13.250
This is a very sweet gesture.

25:13.333 --> 25:15.417
I definitely have to find out
who's responsible.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.750
Hey, thank you, David.,
if you hadn't come along

25:17.833 --> 25:19.292
somebody might have
just walked off with them.

25:19.375 --> 25:22.750
Right. Sure.
You're welcome.

25:31.750 --> 25:33.625
Hello, Marcus.

25:33.708 --> 25:36.042
Duncan. You're looking well.

25:36.125 --> 25:40.167
I am well.
No pain, no cough.

25:40.250 --> 25:42.375
First time in years.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.667
They can do for you
what they've done for me.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.625
I'd feel better
about the recommendation

25:46.708 --> 25:49.917
if I knew which me
I was talking with.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.750
- Does it matter?
- I think so, yes.

25:53.833 --> 25:57.292
Who are they?
Who are you?

25:57.375 --> 26:00.167
I am...was Duncan.

26:01.542 --> 26:04.125
The other part
of me is Vindrizi.

26:05.542 --> 26:07.875
The part of me
that was Duncan remembers

26:07.958 --> 26:11.000
that you were kind to me,
Marcus.

26:11.083 --> 26:12.958
'I don't want to hurt you.'

26:14.375 --> 26:18.250
The part of me that is Vindrizi
says that we will hurt you

26:18.333 --> 26:20.375
if necessary.

26:20.458 --> 26:22.750
We cannot allow you
to interfere.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.542
Interfere? In what?

26:24.625 --> 26:27.625
It says you would
not understand.

26:27.708 --> 26:31.208
It says you've come
at a good time.

26:31.292 --> 26:33.750
We left this one
for you to watch.

26:33.833 --> 26:37.583
So that you can see how
the process is supposed to work.

26:37.667 --> 26:39.458
I've seen it.

26:39.542 --> 26:41.042
I've got a dead body
up in medlab

26:41.125 --> 26:42.750
that tells me all
I need to know.

26:42.833 --> 26:44.500
He was killed
when one these Vindrizi

26:44.583 --> 26:46.208
tried to merge with him.

26:46.292 --> 26:49.500
It says he was not ready
for the merging.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.167
His health was poor

26:51.250 --> 26:55.792
and his blood tainted
by strange chemicals.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.875
It says... will you help us?

26:58.958 --> 27:00.250
No.

27:00.333 --> 27:02.708
It says if you do not help us

27:02.792 --> 27:08.125
others not suited
for the merging may die.

27:08.208 --> 27:11.208
And our kind
will die with them.

27:11.292 --> 27:15.542
If you wish to save lives,
this is the only way.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.292
Oh, it's great,
I haven't had real coffee

27:19.375 --> 27:21.000
since...I can't remember.

27:21.083 --> 27:23.375
It just costs too much
to bring this stuff in.

27:23.458 --> 27:26.667
I had the hydroponic guy
set aside a little space for me.

27:26.750 --> 27:30.042
I know, I know. Hydroponics'
garden is to be used only

27:30.125 --> 27:32.458
for fruit, vegetables,
and oxygen reclamation

27:32.542 --> 27:35.750
but sometimes you've got to
bend the rules a little bit

27:35.833 --> 27:38.708
in order to get what you want.

27:38.792 --> 27:41.375
Does that idea bother you?

27:41.458 --> 27:43.333
No, not really.

27:43.417 --> 27:45.125
I don't think the ends
always justify the means

27:45.208 --> 27:48.875
but if no one's hurt
and if it's good for Earth

27:49.000 --> 27:50.417
I've got no complaints.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.208
That means a lot to you,
doesn't it? Serving Earth?

27:53.292 --> 27:56.917
Well, sure. It's why
we're all here, to follow orders

27:57.000 --> 27:59.083
and do what's right
for Earth.

27:59.167 --> 28:00.917
But what do you do
if there's a contradiction?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.250
If doing what's right for Earth
and following your orders

28:03.333 --> 28:04.833
aren't the same thing?

28:04.917 --> 28:06.958
I don't think that's a decision
I can make on my own.

28:07.042 --> 28:09.250
You can't just decide
which orders to obey

28:09.333 --> 28:10.792
and which to ignore.

28:10.875 --> 28:13.083
We have to respect
the chain of command

28:13.167 --> 28:15.292
or everything falls apart.

28:15.375 --> 28:17.792
So if you saw someone
trying to get other officers

28:17.875 --> 28:22.125
to speak out or even act
against Earthdome

28:22.208 --> 28:23.208
you'd report them?

28:23.292 --> 28:24.708
Absolutely.

28:24.792 --> 28:27.500
Why? Is there anyone
you want me to keep my eye on?

28:27.583 --> 28:30.917
No. No. It's just
a hypothetical question.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.542
With everything that's going on,
it's, it's good to know

28:33.625 --> 28:36.167
where we all stand
with each other.

28:36.250 --> 28:38.125
Well, it's getting late.

28:38.208 --> 28:40.875
Thank you for
stopping by, lieutenant.

28:40.958 --> 28:43.125
I'm glad we had
this time to talk.

28:44.792 --> 28:46.583
Sure. Anytime.

28:48.042 --> 28:50.542
[intense music]

28:55.417 --> 28:57.292
So, any thoughts yet?

28:59.708 --> 29:01.417
Just one.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.875
What's your opinion
of Ivanova?

29:06.958 --> 29:08.792
Susan? Oh.

29:11.042 --> 29:13.208
Well, I've-I've known her
for about two years now.

29:13.292 --> 29:16.125
She's a, she's a fine officer
and a good friend

29:16.208 --> 29:17.792
and-and why are we
talking about her?

29:17.875 --> 29:21.333
When I first came aboard,
she seemed quite friendly.

29:21.417 --> 29:25.167
Lately though,
she's been a bit...distant.

29:25.250 --> 29:28.125
I was thinking perhaps
it was something I'd done.

29:28.208 --> 29:29.500
Oh, no, no, no, no.

29:29.583 --> 29:32.167
It just it takes her a while.
That's all.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.500
Back when you first
showed up

29:33.583 --> 29:35.417
you were just some guy
passing through.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.458
And now you're part
of our little family here.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.083
And I don't think that
she's adjusted just yet.

29:40.167 --> 29:44.458
I sense in her a key
as yet unturned.

29:44.542 --> 29:46.833
And what exactly
does that mean?

29:46.917 --> 29:48.708
[chuckles]
Don't know.

29:48.792 --> 29:51.667
But I sure think it would
be fascinating to find out.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.292
[chuckles]

29:55.833 --> 29:57.792
- It wasn't that funny.
- Oh, come on.

29:57.875 --> 30:00.083
This is, I can't believe this.

30:00.167 --> 30:03.333
We're sitting here
guns pointed at our heads

30:03.417 --> 30:05.375
walled up by alien parasites

30:05.458 --> 30:07.792
neither of us likely to get out
alive and you're thinking

30:07.875 --> 30:09.667
about making a play for Ivanova.
Is that right?

30:09.750 --> 30:11.167
Can you think of a better time?

30:11.250 --> 30:13.042
You're nuts,
you know that? You are.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.708
And-and I've got to be
just as nuts

30:14.792 --> 30:17.917
sitting here talking about it
at a time like this.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.542
Marcus..

30:20.625 --> 30:23.042
'...you are so far
from being her type'

30:23.125 --> 30:25.750
that you're practically
in different galaxies, okay?

30:27.417 --> 30:29.583
Back up.
Away from the door.

30:29.667 --> 30:32.458
One of us is sick.
You, outside now.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.250
Where are you taking him?

30:36.333 --> 30:39.083
If you have to take someone,
take me.

30:39.167 --> 30:41.167
Stephen!

30:45.417 --> 30:48.042
He is dying.
Save him.

30:49.458 --> 30:51.750
The only way to save him
is to take that thing

30:51.833 --> 30:53.042
out of his system.

30:53.125 --> 30:54.708
Unacceptable.

30:54.792 --> 30:56.250
You will save them both.

30:56.333 --> 30:58.500
We have the medical instruments.
Use them.

30:58.583 --> 31:01.375
If you do not cooperate,
you will be directly responsible

31:01.458 --> 31:03.333
for his death.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.375
[instrumental music]

31:10.458 --> 31:12.875
One from three leaves one.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.417
Excuse me.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.250
There's something
I think you should know.

31:19.333 --> 31:21.292
If you really want
your friend to survive

31:21.375 --> 31:22.917
you're gonna need more than
the good doctor.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.083
You're gonna need
some of his instruments.

31:25.167 --> 31:26.917
Not that I really care,
one way or the other

31:27.000 --> 31:28.292
but you know how doctors are

31:28.375 --> 31:31.375
the right tool
for the right job.

31:31.458 --> 31:33.250
You see that tube on the corner
of the table there?

31:33.333 --> 31:36.042
That's a medical scanner.

31:36.125 --> 31:40.292
The Copeland J-5000.
Very advanced.

31:40.375 --> 31:42.458
I was bringing it to him.

31:42.542 --> 31:45.083
You need to get it
to him immediately.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.958
I know. I know.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.708
Why should you believe me?

31:51.792 --> 31:53.167
It could be a weapon
or something.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.458
Check it out yourself.

31:55.542 --> 31:57.958
Just look into the open end.

31:58.042 --> 32:02.583
Yeah that's it. Now, shake.
Shake it twice firmly.

32:02.667 --> 32:04.542
To activate the scanner.

32:14.750 --> 32:17.542
Security!
Hello? Is anyone there?

32:17.625 --> 32:20.292
(automated message)
'Warning, biogenetic
ID comparison'

32:20.375 --> 32:22.333
'indicates you are
not authorized'

32:22.417 --> 32:24.500
'for operation of this link.'

32:24.583 --> 32:26.042
'Please turn it in to security.'

32:26.125 --> 32:28.917
I'm trying to contact security,
you stupid machine.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.875
(automated message)
'Warning, biogenetic
ID comparison..'

32:35.250 --> 32:37.042
Yeah, Ivanova, what is it?

32:37.125 --> 32:39.667
We just picked up someone trying
to use Dr. Franklin's link.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.250
Did you get a fix
on the location?

32:41.333 --> 32:43.875
Brown 84. Recommend you get
a team down there, stat.

32:43.958 --> 32:45.167
You got it.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.250
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

33:23.333 --> 33:26.750
(Samuel)
'Doctor! Your patient is dying.'

33:26.833 --> 33:29.625
'Does this mean nothing to you?'

33:29.708 --> 33:33.250
You care too much to bluff your
way out of this convincingly.

33:33.333 --> 33:35.667
Let me try.

33:35.750 --> 33:38.208
Oh, for the record,
if they kill me

33:38.292 --> 33:40.958
this was not a good idea
on my part.

33:44.333 --> 33:48.708
What, him?
He means nothing to me.

33:48.792 --> 33:52.375
Just another one of you
I'll have to put down

33:52.458 --> 33:54.167
to get out of here.

33:55.708 --> 33:58.333
I say let nature
take its course.

33:59.708 --> 34:02.458
(Duncan)
'Marcus, please
don't do this.'

34:03.708 --> 34:05.792
Why not, Duncan?

34:05.875 --> 34:07.625
Look what they've done to you.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.958
If we save him, what kind
of life is he gonna have

34:10.042 --> 34:12.000
serving these creatures?

34:13.583 --> 34:18.292
A life far better than the one
he has here, Marcus.

34:18.375 --> 34:22.833
All of us here,
we weren't taken over.

34:22.917 --> 34:25.000
We volunteered.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.250
Alright, this is the last place
we tracked the signal.

34:30.333 --> 34:31.333
Split up.
Search by quarters.

34:31.417 --> 34:32.625
You see anything
you let me know

34:32.708 --> 34:34.167
before you move in.
Let's go.

34:35.667 --> 34:39.542
Under the circumstances, Duncan.
I'm afraid, I don't believe you.

34:39.625 --> 34:42.292
(Duncan)
'It says we knew you wouldn't
understand, Marcus.'

34:42.375 --> 34:46.042
That's why we tried
to keep this quiet.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.708
Once we have
fulfilled our mission

34:48.792 --> 34:50.458
we will go.

34:50.542 --> 34:52.292
What mission?

34:52.375 --> 34:54.542
It says, we were created

34:54.625 --> 34:57.833
half a million years ago

34:57.917 --> 35:00.250
bred to be living records
of all those

35:00.333 --> 35:03.000
we have seen and touched.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.333
For all that time,
we have traveled

35:05.417 --> 35:08.167
through the galaxy
in our host bodies.

35:08.250 --> 35:10.750
We have seen double suns set

35:10.833 --> 35:14.083
on worlds so far away

35:14.167 --> 35:17.458
you have no name for them.

35:17.542 --> 35:19.250
We remember music
that was played

35:19.333 --> 35:23.250
before your kind
learned to speak.

35:23.333 --> 35:25.500
Within us..

35:25.583 --> 35:28.833
Is the living memory

35:28.917 --> 35:31.750
of deeds and stories

35:31.833 --> 35:35.083
civilizations and passions

35:35.167 --> 35:39.542
wars and struggle,
and great beauty.

35:39.625 --> 35:43.417
But, in time, even we die

35:43.500 --> 35:47.875
unless we find shelter
within other living beings.

35:47.958 --> 35:52.292
So we seek out those who have
nothing to look forward to.

35:52.375 --> 35:55.708
Those whose lives
are at an end.

35:55.792 --> 35:58.042
Those who know
they will be never more

35:58.125 --> 35:59.750
than they are now.

35:59.833 --> 36:04.583
Those who will never
know beauty or peace or purpose

36:04.667 --> 36:06.958
and we give them that.

36:07.042 --> 36:09.750
Through us, they are born
into a new life.

36:09.833 --> 36:13.917
Samuel, I thought
I'd given you a purpose

36:14.000 --> 36:16.417
to help me in our task ahead.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.750
Your purpose comes
from the outside

36:19.833 --> 36:22.083
to fight someone else's battles.

36:23.708 --> 36:26.250
Ours comes from within.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.167
Why should we believe you?

36:28.250 --> 36:29.667
You're controlling
these people.

36:29.750 --> 36:32.750
They'd say whatever you want.

36:32.833 --> 36:35.083
Do you trust me, Marcus?

36:35.167 --> 36:37.792
I trust the Duncan I knew

36:37.875 --> 36:40.292
not the Duncan that stands
in front of me.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.875
[intense music]

36:51.375 --> 36:54.125
[screaming]

37:05.292 --> 37:06.625
Duncan?

37:06.708 --> 37:10.208
It said there
was no other way, Marcus.

37:10.292 --> 37:13.250
Now it's over.

37:13.333 --> 37:15.375
Don't you see, Marcus?

37:17.042 --> 37:20.333
I was going
to live and die here.

37:20.417 --> 37:23.292
Never add up
to any damn thing.

37:26.833 --> 37:29.042
It's true, Marcus.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.417
It's all true.

37:32.500 --> 37:36.417
Everything they told you,
it's true.

37:36.500 --> 37:40.542
'When it was inside me
I saw flame birds'

37:40.625 --> 37:43.625
dying on Orion 7.

37:43.708 --> 37:49.333
I saw cities floating
in the air five miles high.

37:49.417 --> 37:51.333
I knew everything.

37:51.417 --> 37:54.500
Our mission is
to preserve these memories.

37:54.583 --> 37:59.292
All our experience
against the day when all life

37:59.375 --> 38:02.750
all knowledge falls
into a new dark age.

38:04.083 --> 38:05.458
'When the books have gone'

38:05.542 --> 38:07.833
and the histories
have been burned.

38:07.917 --> 38:11.667
Every world will look back
to learn what went before

38:11.750 --> 38:15.542
and they will turn to us
and we will be there

38:15.625 --> 38:19.417
keepers of the past,
the present

38:19.500 --> 38:21.125
and the future.

38:22.458 --> 38:25.208
[intense music]

38:25.292 --> 38:27.250
Before I go along with this
I want complete

38:27.333 --> 38:28.875
and total verification.

38:28.958 --> 38:31.167
I want to go over every inch
of your biologies.

38:31.250 --> 38:33.833
I want complete statements
by everyone involved

38:33.917 --> 38:37.542
and no more volunteers without
my approval and supervision.

38:37.625 --> 38:39.917
Otherwise, I'll have
security take you in

38:40.000 --> 38:43.208
and remove the Vindrizi
by force. Is that clear?

38:47.958 --> 38:49.333
Agreed.

38:52.292 --> 38:54.917
- Franklin to Garibaldi.
- 'Stephen. Are you okay?'

38:55.000 --> 38:56.750
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm in Brown 87.

38:56.833 --> 38:58.292
I need a medevac team
in here, stat.

38:58.375 --> 39:00.375
We have a patient
that needs immediate treatment.

39:00.458 --> 39:02.750
I'm sorry, Duncan.

39:02.833 --> 39:05.750
I didn't know.
Is there any way--

39:05.833 --> 39:08.958
No, no, no,
I can't take on another one.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.917
They said it'd do
permanent damage

39:12.000 --> 39:13.875
to my neural system.

39:16.167 --> 39:21.917
Everything I saw
when we were joined.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.833
The music.
All of it.

39:25.917 --> 39:27.917
It's going away.

39:29.500 --> 39:34.250
By tomorrow...
I shan't remember any of it.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.583
Marcus.

39:39.667 --> 39:43.667
If you could have
seen with our eyes

39:45.292 --> 39:47.958
you could have seen..

39:48.042 --> 39:49.625

39:53.917 --> 39:56.000

40:00.042 --> 40:02.583
[indistinct chatter]

40:21.458 --> 40:23.250
[indistinct chatter on PA]

40:23.333 --> 40:24.500
Duncan.

40:24.583 --> 40:26.833
I just heard
you were leaving.

40:26.917 --> 40:28.250
Please don't.

40:28.333 --> 40:31.208
If you go,
I'll miss you.

40:31.292 --> 40:34.417
- And I hate that feeling.
- And I have to, Marcus.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.958
You see, for a while there

40:36.042 --> 40:37.917
I knew what it was like
to be special

40:38.000 --> 40:42.500
and I can't go back
to what I was.

40:42.583 --> 40:48.042
When we were joined,
I...I saw things out there.

40:48.125 --> 40:49.833
Incredible things.

40:49.917 --> 40:52.125
I want to try to find them

40:52.208 --> 40:54.333
really see them

40:54.417 --> 40:56.292
just once before I die.

40:58.042 --> 41:01.167
Be special one more time.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.792
I wish there were
something I could do.

41:03.875 --> 41:06.167
- I'm sorry.
- No.

41:07.417 --> 41:11.500
You did what you did
because you cared.

41:11.583 --> 41:13.708
Got nothing to do with you
and everything

41:13.792 --> 41:16.375
everything to do with me.

41:16.458 --> 41:20.042
Maybe it was good.

41:20.125 --> 41:24.833
Maybe we,
we all need to wake up

41:24.917 --> 41:29.917
become special
before it's too late.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.750
(male #2 over radio)
'Earth transport Dyson'

41:31.833 --> 41:33.417
'is now boarding
at Gate Seven.'

41:33.500 --> 41:35.458
Duncan.

41:35.542 --> 41:38.375
Got to go now, Marcus.

41:38.458 --> 41:41.250
Take care of the old place
for me, and..

41:41.333 --> 41:44.375
Maybe when I've seen
what I've been looking for

41:44.458 --> 41:46.917
I'll come back.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.417
Take care, Marcus.

41:49.500 --> 41:52.083

(Stephen)
'I've been checking
out their story'

41:59.250 --> 42:01.125
'and so far,
everything seems to fit.'

42:01.208 --> 42:03.583
(Garibaldi)
'If they have this knowledge,
why keep it a secret?'

42:03.667 --> 42:04.917
Information is power.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.708
If anyone ever wanted
to eliminate that knowledge

42:06.792 --> 42:10.042
they'd be the first ones
up against the wall.

42:10.125 --> 42:12.417
So, uh, how'd Marcus do?

42:12.500 --> 42:14.250
It's the first time
you've worked with him, right?

42:14.333 --> 42:18.250
Fine. I mean the main thing
though, under pressure

42:18.333 --> 42:20.542
he's okay.

42:20.625 --> 42:22.667
And I think that he
would definitely appreciate

42:22.750 --> 42:25.125
a second chance
with you, Susan.

42:28.542 --> 42:31.417
That's it.
He must have sent them.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.958
Him what?
Sent what?

42:34.042 --> 42:35.667
I'll be back.

42:38.458 --> 42:41.000
[dramatic music]

42:47.708 --> 42:49.000
Keep 'em.

42:50.333 --> 42:53.292
Thank you.
I will.

42:53.375 --> 42:56.583
Well, I guess
there's hope for us after all.
