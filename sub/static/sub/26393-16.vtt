WEBVTT

00:01.596 --> 00:03.685
All right, so we replaced your pads,

00:03.710 --> 00:07.273
resurfaced your rotors, and
adjusted your calipers.

00:07.298 --> 00:10.192
Great. Please tell me that
means you fixed my brakes.

00:10.217 --> 00:13.577
Well, lets just say I
don’t expect your car

00:13.602 --> 00:14.767
on my lawn again.

00:16.030 --> 00:18.806
You can go and settle this
up with Tina in the office.

00:18.831 --> 00:20.480
Your cars in the back getting washed.

00:20.583 --> 00:22.907
Ooh, your shop is so fancy.

00:22.932 --> 00:25.417
Well, you also get a
complimentary air freshener.

00:25.575 --> 00:27.709
Pine tree, cinnamon vanilla,

00:27.734 --> 00:31.342
or my personal favorite,
"New Calvin Smell."

00:32.959 --> 00:34.928
Is that like "new car smell"?

00:34.960 --> 00:37.578
Yeah, but with notes of
cocoa butter and swagger.

00:40.851 --> 00:43.753
Ooh, I’ve never seen
you at work before.

00:43.778 --> 00:45.965
Look at you, Mrs. Businesswoman.

00:45.990 --> 00:48.582
Balancing the books,
invoicing suppliers...

00:48.607 --> 00:50.274
Girl, I’m on Facebook.

00:51.854 --> 00:54.113
My cousin just changed
her relationship status

00:54.138 --> 00:56.929
to "its complicated," and
we know what that means.

00:56.954 --> 00:59.604
Here comes the Bible quotes
and the bikini pictures.

00:59.629 --> 01:02.350
Calvin told me to give you this.

01:02.567 --> 01:04.577
Oh, no, no. Don't be ridiculous.

01:04.602 --> 01:05.989
Were not charging you.

01:06.081 --> 01:08.649
What are you talking about? Its $300.

01:08.716 --> 01:12.841
Calvin rotored my caterpillars
and padded my surfaces.

01:13.861 --> 01:15.251
Gemma, were friends, okay?

01:15.276 --> 01:16.745
Don't worry about it.

01:17.005 --> 01:19.278
No. Really, Tina, I
appreciate the thought,

01:19.310 --> 01:20.253
but I have to pay you.

01:20.278 --> 01:21.480
Gemma Johnson,

01:21.505 --> 01:23.278
I just called you a friend.

01:23.303 --> 01:24.875
And friends do things for each other,

01:24.900 --> 01:28.207
so don’t insult me when I’m
trying to show you some love.

01:29.483 --> 01:30.753
Are you sure?

01:30.778 --> 01:32.906
Girl, don’t make me
cut your brake lines.

01:34.222 --> 01:36.226
Have you actually ever done that?

01:37.023 --> 01:38.428
No.

01:40.624 --> 01:42.460
Well, in that case, thank you.

01:42.804 --> 01:43.958
You’re welcome.

01:43.983 --> 01:46.285
Now come help me find a
Bible verse that says

01:46.310 --> 01:47.444
"Stick to a one-piece."

01:50.890 --> 01:52.137
Hey, Calvin.

01:52.162 --> 01:54.653
Oh. Thanks for taking care of our car.

01:54.678 --> 01:55.934
Not a problem, Dave.

01:55.959 --> 01:57.527
You guys did a great job.

01:57.552 --> 01:58.800
We try.

01:58.825 --> 02:00.494
Oh, and thanks so much
for comping the bill.

02:00.519 --> 02:02.308
Oh, whats that, now?

02:03.206 --> 02:05.342
You know how you hooked
us up with the car.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.782
Who knew you were so generous?

02:07.275 --> 02:08.685
Not me.

02:09.756 --> 02:11.157
Well, I owe you one.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.494
You owe me a lot more than one.

02:13.854 --> 02:15.189
Whats that, buddy?

02:15.214 --> 02:16.986
Oh, nothing, buddy.

02:19.630 --> 02:21.115
Tina!

02:30.540 --> 02:33.606
Tina! Tina!

02:33.783 --> 02:36.152
Ooh, Dad seems pissed. We should go.

02:37.872 --> 02:40.563
Yeah, Dad seems pissed. We should stay.

02:41.237 --> 02:42.306
What are you yelling about?

02:42.331 --> 02:45.424
Is Leon selling meat out of
the back of his van again?

02:46.106 --> 02:49.012
Did you tell the Johnsons they
didn’t have to pay their bill?

02:49.037 --> 02:49.970
Yeah. Why?

02:49.995 --> 02:51.184
Why?

02:51.705 --> 02:54.482
Because 300 bucks is a lot of money.

02:54.536 --> 02:56.982
That's like 60 rib eyes.

02:57.164 --> 02:59.347
Wait, so those steaks
are five bucks apiece?

02:59.372 --> 03:01.465
Yeah, Pop, that's not real meat.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.565
Gemma's my friend.

03:05.598 --> 03:07.159
Its not like were hurting for money.

03:07.324 --> 03:09.037
Its not about the money.

03:09.195 --> 03:11.331
Its about that you didn’t ask me.

03:13.014 --> 03:14.649
Why do I have to ask you?

03:14.769 --> 03:16.497
Because I'm the boss.

03:17.714 --> 03:20.210
Yep, Mom is pissed. We should go.

03:20.789 --> 03:23.371
Yeah. This time I agree.

03:24.886 --> 03:27.190
Calvin, I didn’t realize I had a boss.

03:27.215 --> 03:28.950
I thought I had a business partner.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.731
Babe, you know what I’m saying.

03:30.756 --> 03:32.981
All right? It, its a division of labor.

03:33.006 --> 03:34.491
- Mm-hmm.
- I’m the boss at the shop.

03:34.516 --> 03:36.257
You’re the boss here at home.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:48.071 --> 03:49.890
Wha... Why-why are we laughing?

03:49.915 --> 03:51.284
Oh...

03:51.309 --> 03:54.187
Cause you thought I would
buy that nonsense.

03:56.685 --> 04:01.808
Calvin Butler, love of my life,
partner at home and at work...

04:02.524 --> 04:03.948
I made a decision

04:03.973 --> 04:06.880
and I expect for you to respect that.

04:10.245 --> 04:12.439
Okay, so was that a "I love you" kiss

04:12.464 --> 04:15.065
or a "you need to let this go" kiss?

04:15.386 --> 04:16.831
Well go with both.

04:17.901 --> 04:19.247
Hey, guys.

04:19.286 --> 04:20.017
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:20.043 --> 04:22.284
We just wanted to stop
by and say thanks again

04:22.309 --> 04:24.421
for taking such good care
of us down at the shop.

04:24.446 --> 04:26.595
Aw, don’t be ridiculous.

04:26.620 --> 04:28.422
Its our pleasure. Right, Calvin?

04:30.710 --> 04:32.499
300%.

04:34.768 --> 04:36.409
But, you know, we talked about it,

04:36.434 --> 04:38.756
and it just feels wrong to
let you do it for free.

04:38.781 --> 04:40.065
All right.

04:41.151 --> 04:44.755
Which is why we want to have
you over for dinner tomorrow.

04:47.143 --> 04:49.680
Well, that’s wonderful.

04:49.705 --> 04:51.688
Well bring the wine. You
want to pick one out?

04:51.713 --> 04:54.443
Ooh, I don’t know. We might
have to taste it first.

04:54.635 --> 04:56.566
I might need to taste it twice.

05:01.706 --> 05:03.646
I want that money, Dave.

05:06.249 --> 05:07.351
What?

05:07.659 --> 05:09.699
And don’t tell our wives.

05:09.724 --> 05:10.884
I tell Gemma everything.

05:10.909 --> 05:12.790
Even when she asks me not to.

05:13.345 --> 05:16.672
Well, on behalf of both of
us, keep your mouth shut.

05:19.267 --> 05:21.487
So, if the chicken had six eggs,

05:21.512 --> 05:23.261
and the farmer took away five,

05:23.286 --> 05:24.921
what did the chicken have left?

05:25.408 --> 05:27.622
Where do chicken babies come from?

05:29.251 --> 05:33.296
Oh. Well, that’s an
interesting question.

05:33.570 --> 05:35.974
You see, instead of genitals...

05:38.184 --> 05:42.462
hens and roosters have a special
hole called a cloaca...

05:43.612 --> 05:47.435
that’s used for both going to
the bathroom and making babies.

05:48.644 --> 05:50.670
If you don’t know, just say so.

05:55.266 --> 05:58.430
Did he just trick me into
finishing his homework?

06:01.250 --> 06:02.418
Hey, Gemma.

06:02.443 --> 06:04.113
Hey, sweetie.

06:04.510 --> 06:06.601
Uh, I was thinking.

06:07.252 --> 06:09.288
You know, maybe we pay Calvin

06:09.313 --> 06:11.109
for the work that he did on the car.

06:11.134 --> 06:11.955
I asked,

06:11.980 --> 06:14.211
but Tina threatened to
cut my brake lines.

06:15.593 --> 06:17.467
I think, playfully.

06:20.345 --> 06:22.626
I know, its just... its the
principle of the thing.

06:22.651 --> 06:24.122
You know, where I come
from, a man gets paid

06:24.147 --> 06:25.673
for the work that he does.

06:25.788 --> 06:28.383
First of all, we come
from the same place.

06:30.134 --> 06:32.782
Uh, hello.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.130
East Kalamazoo is an
entirely different world

06:36.155 --> 06:37.982
from Hickory Corners.

06:39.368 --> 06:41.410
And second, it would be rude.

06:41.482 --> 06:44.050
Tina explicitly said she
didn’t want us to pay.

06:44.084 --> 06:45.223
I know, but people say things

06:45.248 --> 06:46.483
that they don’t mean all the time.

06:46.508 --> 06:49.178
Like, when I floated the idea of
becoming an amateur beekeeper,

06:49.203 --> 06:51.400
and you told me to do what I want.

06:51.981 --> 06:54.311
You’re right. I definitely
didn’t mean that.

06:55.362 --> 06:56.403
See?

06:56.428 --> 06:58.428
And how many times did you get stung?

06:59.748 --> 07:02.596
We still don’t know that
those were my bees.

07:04.368 --> 07:07.007
So we agree. Were not
paying them, right?

07:08.605 --> 07:09.471
Okay.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.516
Good. Now I’m gonna go tuck in Grover,

07:11.541 --> 07:13.663
before he starts looking
for his cloaca.

07:15.417 --> 07:18.458
Yeah, Malcolm and Marty.

07:18.677 --> 07:21.516
What do the Butler boys
got crackalackin tonight?

07:21.639 --> 07:23.942
Well, Marty and I are checking
out this new dating app.

07:23.967 --> 07:26.964
You would not believe all
the fine women on here.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.180
Ooh-ooh!

07:28.666 --> 07:31.222
Excuse me. Are these seats taken?

07:31.260 --> 07:33.413
Yeah, I think there was
some guy here or something.

07:34.609 --> 07:38.248
What? What?

07:38.490 --> 07:41.301
What the hell is wrong with you two?

07:42.013 --> 07:43.264
You online shopping when

07:43.289 --> 07:45.300
you already in the mall.

07:46.183 --> 07:48.164
Look, the game has changed, Ernie.

07:48.189 --> 07:50.601
We would have to have a whole
conversation with those girls

07:50.626 --> 07:52.068
to find out if we were a match.

07:52.093 --> 07:54.094
Yeah, but with the
app, we already know,

07:54.119 --> 07:55.817
- and we just swipe right.
- Mmm.

07:56.583 --> 07:58.727
Well, back in my day, if
a woman didn’t like you,

07:58.752 --> 08:00.729
she literally swiped you away.

08:01.058 --> 08:03.415
Once, I got swiped off a boat.

08:05.554 --> 08:07.526
Oh! I got my first match.

08:07.551 --> 08:09.806
Oh, she is fine. She likes baseball,

08:09.831 --> 08:12.400
shes into poetry, and
her name is Ebony.

08:13.651 --> 08:16.226
Ha-ha! Houston, we have liftoff.

08:16.251 --> 08:17.350
I got a match, too.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.954
Yeah, her name is... Ebony.

08:24.662 --> 08:25.695
Oh...

08:25.720 --> 08:27.889
let the games begin.

08:31.284 --> 08:33.083
Dave.

08:34.405 --> 08:36.407
Dave. Where are you?

08:36.432 --> 08:38.857
- I’m right here.
- What?

08:43.121 --> 08:44.555
Why you scaring me like that?

08:44.580 --> 08:46.249
Sorry. Sorry.

08:46.724 --> 08:48.560
I’m on the down-low.

08:51.413 --> 08:53.113
Just so you know,

08:53.138 --> 08:55.690
in this neighborhood, that
doesn’t mean what you think.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.033
Whatever. Look...

08:59.637 --> 09:01.039
- Got your money.
- Great.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.461
But I cant give it to you.

09:02.873 --> 09:04.221
Why not?

09:04.309 --> 09:06.546
Because Gemma wants to
respect Tina’s decision.

09:06.571 --> 09:07.924
So you see my situation.

09:07.949 --> 09:09.316
I want to pay you.

09:09.985 --> 09:11.939
But I cant.

09:13.187 --> 09:15.475
Dave, why are you wasting
my time right now?

09:15.500 --> 09:18.065
Because I believe that paying
you is the right thing to do.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.209
A man deserves to be paid
for the work that he does.

09:20.234 --> 09:22.001
Okay, so give me the money.

09:22.746 --> 09:25.615
But, then Id be going
behind my wife’s back,

09:25.640 --> 09:27.592
and I don’t think that’s the
right thing to do, either.

09:27.617 --> 09:29.752
Oh... okay.

09:29.886 --> 09:32.117
I see, you one of those kind of dudes.

09:32.753 --> 09:33.921
What do you mean?

09:33.946 --> 09:37.782
Oh, you know, the kind that’s
afraid to do the right thing,

09:37.807 --> 09:39.977
so you hide behind your wife.

09:45.448 --> 09:48.986
Are you calling me a Hickory
Corners kind of man?

09:55.881 --> 10:00.328
That is as confusing to me
as "the down-low" is to you.

10:01.762 --> 10:03.196
Okay, you know what? Fine. Here.

10:03.221 --> 10:04.849
- Look. Take the money.
- Cool.

10:04.874 --> 10:06.566
But just so you know,
I feel super guilty,

10:06.591 --> 10:08.378
because I’ve never
lied to Gemma before.

10:08.403 --> 10:09.645
Plus...

10:09.670 --> 10:11.080
I’m a terrible liar.

10:11.105 --> 10:12.374
What are you guys doing?

10:12.407 --> 10:15.642
W-Were just having a late night
meeting for our recycling club.

10:16.455 --> 10:18.843
Oh. Cool.

10:21.672 --> 10:23.537
I just lied to my son!

10:23.562 --> 10:24.916
I feel horrible.

10:24.941 --> 10:25.908
Yeah.

10:25.933 --> 10:27.869
- So do I.
- Really?

10:27.894 --> 10:29.330
No.

10:29.675 --> 10:32.311
See? That’s how you lie.

10:43.324 --> 10:44.898
Oh!

10:46.950 --> 10:49.118
We’ve done a horrible thing.

10:49.152 --> 10:51.105
I need to put a bell on you.

10:51.808 --> 10:55.119
I feel so guilty about lying
to Gemma, sneaking around

10:55.144 --> 10:57.413
on her on the down-low.

10:58.468 --> 11:00.853
Okay, you’ve got to stop saying that,

11:00.878 --> 11:02.609
or look up what it means.

11:04.443 --> 11:06.048
I cant even look her in the eye.

11:06.073 --> 11:08.869
I spent all breakfast
focusing on her left nostril.

11:09.272 --> 11:11.244
I cant do this anymore, Calvin.

11:11.349 --> 11:12.702
I have to tell her

11:12.727 --> 11:15.515
about this and that stray nose hair.

11:16.386 --> 11:18.423
Look, you’ve already
committed the crime.

11:18.448 --> 11:20.382
There’s no way you can undo it.

11:20.407 --> 11:22.316
You could give me back the money.

11:22.341 --> 11:25.291
Like I said, there’s no
way you can undo it.

11:25.316 --> 11:27.818
- But...
- Look, Dave,

11:27.843 --> 11:30.332
how will knowing the
truth make Gemma feel?

11:30.475 --> 11:32.986
I don’t know, hurt, angry, betrayed.

11:33.011 --> 11:36.948
Exactly, so by you telling
her, all you’ll be doing

11:37.247 --> 11:39.219
is making yourself feel better.

11:40.495 --> 11:41.871
I guess.

11:42.070 --> 11:45.752
Be a good husband, Dave.
Keep lying to your wife.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.365
I just wish that lying
came easier to me.

11:49.390 --> 11:50.956
Oh, hey, Dave, what are you doing here?

11:50.981 --> 11:52.720
Calvin and I are gonna donate blood.

11:54.191 --> 11:56.033
Oh, really? That’s great.

11:56.058 --> 11:58.167
I’ve been trying to get
him to go for years.

11:58.192 --> 11:59.877
So whats your secret, Dave?

11:59.902 --> 12:00.949
My secret? I don’t have a secret.

12:00.974 --> 12:03.230
I’m not feeling too well.
Anybody else feel dizzy?

12:05.919 --> 12:08.222
Well, it sounds like you
shouldn’t be giving blood.

12:08.414 --> 12:10.284
Calvin, looks like you
got to go without him.

12:10.317 --> 12:11.351
Okay.

12:11.692 --> 12:12.980
All right.

12:13.005 --> 12:13.876
Ill make sure

12:13.901 --> 12:15.590
he gives some later.

12:19.366 --> 12:21.781
You’ve been on that phone
since I got home from work.

12:21.806 --> 12:22.787
Whats going on?

12:22.812 --> 12:25.148
Just asking out this girl I
met on this app last night.

12:25.173 --> 12:27.218
Oh, nice. Whats her name?

12:27.317 --> 12:28.406
Ebony.

12:28.431 --> 12:31.944
Good. You just answered
my next question.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.469
Hey, guys.

12:38.494 --> 12:40.934
Hey, baby. I just finished
folding your laundry.

12:40.959 --> 12:43.069
Oh, good, cause I think
my lucky shirts in there,

12:43.094 --> 12:46.068
and I’m-a need it for
my date with Ebony.

12:47.562 --> 12:48.989
Huh.

12:49.014 --> 12:52.650
What are the odds of you both
talking to girls named Eb...?

12:56.139 --> 12:58.012
Aw, hell no.

12:59.998 --> 13:01.954
You both got my hopes up for nothing.

13:01.979 --> 13:03.089
That girls a ho.

13:04.259 --> 13:05.564
No, shes not.

13:05.589 --> 13:07.557
Oh, yeah? What kind of girl

13:07.582 --> 13:09.429
dates two brothers at the same time?

13:09.454 --> 13:10.758
She doesn’t know were brothers.

13:10.783 --> 13:13.167
Yeah, Mom, that would be weird.

13:15.573 --> 13:17.772
You know, I-I-I cant believe you two.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.542
You mean to tell me that,
in a world full of women,

13:20.567 --> 13:22.595
you’ll seriously risk your relationship

13:22.620 --> 13:24.255
fighting over the same girl?

13:25.232 --> 13:26.344
- Definitely.
- Yes.

13:26.369 --> 13:27.959
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

13:29.380 --> 13:31.181
So, how you holding up, man?

13:31.551 --> 13:33.016
Terrible.

13:33.041 --> 13:35.306
I still cant look Gemma in the eye.

13:35.331 --> 13:36.643
I feel like shes gonna know.

13:36.668 --> 13:38.812
Don’t you go Hickory Corners on me.

13:41.348 --> 13:44.390
This is so nice. Thanks
again for having us.

13:44.415 --> 13:46.713
Oh, please. Its our pleasure.
Right, Dave?

13:46.738 --> 13:48.677
Yeah.

13:56.263 --> 13:57.848
What are you looking at, Dave?

13:57.948 --> 13:59.604
There’s a bug.

14:00.237 --> 14:01.582
Oh-oh, yeah,

14:01.607 --> 14:04.230
yeah, I see it, too. Its, uh... Oh!

14:04.255 --> 14:05.509
There. Got it.

14:06.168 --> 14:08.251
- Calvin.
- What?

14:08.276 --> 14:10.174
It looked like the bitey kind.

14:10.199 --> 14:12.448
West Nile is in these streets.

14:14.912 --> 14:16.681
You know what, we should toast.

14:16.706 --> 14:18.677
Dave, why don’t you pour
everyone some more wine?

14:18.702 --> 14:20.329
Yeah, that’s a great idea.

14:21.973 --> 14:23.174
Okay.

14:23.199 --> 14:25.022
Calvin, here you go.

14:25.047 --> 14:27.382
Tina. Thank you.

14:27.407 --> 14:28.275
Dear...

14:28.300 --> 14:30.780
- Dave!
- Oh, no!

14:30.805 --> 14:31.899
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry..

14:31.924 --> 14:33.426
- I got to go clean this up.
- Oh, my goodness.

14:33.451 --> 14:34.040
I’m so sorry.

14:34.065 --> 14:36.002
It got all over your couch...
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:36.027 --> 14:37.292
Wrong wife, Dave.

14:42.943 --> 14:44.228
Dude.

14:44.445 --> 14:46.379
What is wrong with you, man?

14:46.412 --> 14:48.482
You got to pull it together. I cant!

14:48.515 --> 14:52.022
My hands are all sweaty, my
heart is pounding in my throat.

14:52.218 --> 14:56.558
Oh, you mean like the way I felt
when I had to give blood today?

14:59.149 --> 15:00.666
Huh?

15:01.850 --> 15:04.761
It took her four stabs to find a vein.

15:06.532 --> 15:10.032
What is up with Dave? Hes
been acting so weird.

15:10.057 --> 15:12.079
Yeah, even for him.

15:13.415 --> 15:15.797
You know, Calvin’s been
acting funny, too.

15:15.822 --> 15:16.889
How?

15:16.923 --> 15:19.688
Well, if a mosquito was
gonna give Dave West Nile,

15:19.713 --> 15:21.412
I don’t think Calvin would stop it.

15:23.238 --> 15:25.480
Maybe its because they’re
in the same club.

15:25.743 --> 15:27.012
What club?

15:27.037 --> 15:28.592
The recycling club.

15:28.862 --> 15:31.793
I saw them outside last
night whispering about it.

15:33.716 --> 15:35.369
Oh, really?

15:35.394 --> 15:38.485
Yeah, then Dad gave Mr.
Calvin some money.

15:42.216 --> 15:43.608
How much money?

15:43.633 --> 15:47.050
I don’t know, probably
like a million dollars.

15:48.785 --> 15:50.087
Hmm.

15:50.112 --> 15:51.898
Okay, sweetie, why don’t
you run off to bed?

15:51.923 --> 15:55.308
Okay... but save that
empty bottle for me.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.185
I want to join that club and get paid.

16:02.081 --> 16:04.829
You know, that little boy is
getting blacker and blacker.

16:05.998 --> 16:08.533
I cant believe Dave
gave Calvin that money.

16:08.558 --> 16:11.595
I specifically told him I was
trying to honor our friendship.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.296
I told Calvin the same thing,

16:13.321 --> 16:15.386
but apparently their
egos are more important.

16:15.411 --> 16:17.344
This could have gotten really ugly.

16:17.534 --> 16:19.369
If you’d found out about
Dave paying Calvin

16:19.394 --> 16:20.690
and thought that I was okay with it...

16:20.715 --> 16:21.947
I would’ve been pissed.

16:21.972 --> 16:23.548
Yeah, and then we
would’ve been in a fight.

16:23.573 --> 16:26.121
Not a real one.

16:26.851 --> 16:28.993
You don’t want to catch these hands.

16:30.354 --> 16:31.823
And all because of them.

16:31.848 --> 16:33.550
They should be taught a lesson.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.676
How?

16:34.701 --> 16:36.838
Maybe we should get into a fight.

16:37.324 --> 16:41.268
Okay. But I don’t want
to catch those hands.

16:44.156 --> 16:47.503
Come on, man, look, we just
have to make it through dinner

16:47.528 --> 16:49.822
and we never have to
see each other again.

16:52.984 --> 16:55.215
How is that gonna fix my problem?

16:55.240 --> 16:57.853
It doesn’t. It fixes mine.

16:59.025 --> 17:01.387
You know, I cannot believe
you, Gemma Johnson!

17:01.412 --> 17:03.282
Were supposed to be
friends, but you’re...

17:03.307 --> 17:05.345
you’re just the liar next door.

17:06.009 --> 17:08.251
We are friends, Tina.

17:08.276 --> 17:10.683
You have to believe me, I didn’t know.

17:10.708 --> 17:11.973
Okay, what is going on?

17:11.999 --> 17:14.373
I found out the truth that
Dave gave you the money.

17:14.397 --> 17:17.142
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, God.

17:18.054 --> 17:21.560
And that Gemma was the one who
forced you both to do it.

17:21.586 --> 17:22.608
- Yes.
- What?

17:22.634 --> 17:24.691
Yes, it was her.

17:25.518 --> 17:26.886
You know what, Tina?

17:26.911 --> 17:29.546
I am sick of you and
your false accusations.

17:29.571 --> 17:32.682
Disrespect me one more
time and see what happens.

17:35.320 --> 17:39.139
Oh, really, you little fake-ass Barbie?

17:41.328 --> 17:43.057
What you gonna do?

17:43.082 --> 17:44.038
Tell me what you gonna do.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.708
Oh, Ill tell you what I’m gonna do.

17:45.733 --> 17:47.527
I’m gonna make you catch these hands.

17:47.552 --> 17:49.527
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:49.552 --> 17:51.085
Did you hear what she said to me?!

17:51.110 --> 17:52.630
Tina, please.

17:52.655 --> 17:55.439
Gemma had nothing to do with this.

17:56.332 --> 17:57.842
She didn’t?

17:57.867 --> 17:58.969
No.

17:59.389 --> 18:01.014
Is this true, Calvin?

18:01.496 --> 18:03.299
Yeah, hes right, babe.

18:03.654 --> 18:05.374
It was all Dave.

18:09.243 --> 18:11.276
Seriously, Calvin?

18:11.465 --> 18:13.897
Look, fine, it was both of us.

18:14.570 --> 18:16.397
Were really sorry.

18:22.252 --> 18:24.065
Yay! We got you!

18:24.090 --> 18:25.526
We were just pretending to fight.

18:25.551 --> 18:28.101
Oh, my God! You were so good.

18:28.126 --> 18:29.804
Oh, my God, no, you were so good.

18:29.829 --> 18:31.306
"The liar next door."

18:32.012 --> 18:33.965
You know, that just came
to me in the moment.

18:33.990 --> 18:35.614
- Oh, my God, you’re so good.
- Now, hold on.

18:35.639 --> 18:39.510
This whole thing was fake just
to make us look like fools?

18:39.535 --> 18:41.874
Yeah, and it worked.

18:43.864 --> 18:45.247
My heart is racing.

18:45.272 --> 18:47.769
Oh, my God, I’m pumped. Lets go out.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.769
Yeah, maybe get into a real fight.

18:50.794 --> 18:52.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow
your roll, Gemma.

18:53.351 --> 18:54.975
Hold up,

18:55.000 --> 18:56.195
y’all just gonna leave us?

18:56.220 --> 18:59.450
Hell yeah. You two totally
went behind our backs

18:59.475 --> 19:01.872
when we were supposed to be partners.

19:02.106 --> 19:04.228
Yeah, Dave, if I wanted
to marry a liar,

19:04.253 --> 19:06.882
I would have stayed in Hickory Corners.

19:11.643 --> 19:14.363
Damn, dude, how bad is that place?

19:20.144 --> 19:24.473
So, um, how was your date with Ebony?
I bet it sucked.

19:24.917 --> 19:26.602
<i>Au contraire, Mon frère.</i>

19:26.627 --> 19:28.210
It was like something
out of a movie, okay?

19:28.226 --> 19:30.140
Think <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> meets

19:30.165 --> 19:31.556
<i>Lady and the Tramp.</i>

19:31.581 --> 19:33.706
Oh, so you guys had spaghetti

19:33.731 --> 19:35.601
and then she killed herself?

19:37.386 --> 19:38.654
No.

19:38.679 --> 19:39.997
We went to the park with her dogs,

19:40.022 --> 19:42.491
and their names are Romeo and Juliet.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.484
That sounds super lame.

19:45.596 --> 19:47.573
Well, that long hug I
got at the end wasn’t.

19:47.598 --> 19:48.832
What'd you guys do?

19:48.857 --> 19:50.919
Well... I picked her up...

19:50.944 --> 19:52.693
On the bus.

19:53.069 --> 19:55.201
We went to a poetry reading...

19:55.226 --> 19:56.610
That was free.

19:56.742 --> 19:58.501
And then I dropped her
off at her place...

19:58.526 --> 19:59.959
Because you don’t have your own.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.766
Malcolm? Marty?

20:05.791 --> 20:07.508
- Ebony?
- Hey.

20:07.533 --> 20:09.935
- You guys know each other?
- Uh, yeah.

20:10.221 --> 20:11.254
How?

20:11.289 --> 20:12.778
- Well...
- Well, uh...

20:12.803 --> 20:13.807
We-we-we...

20:13.832 --> 20:15.593
Oh, they brothers.

20:17.505 --> 20:18.951
Are you ready, beautiful?

20:18.976 --> 20:19.632
What?

20:19.657 --> 20:21.844
Now-now, wait-wait-wait, wait a second.

20:21.885 --> 20:23.219
How do you two know each other?

20:23.244 --> 20:25.607
Oh, were a match. Yeah.

20:25.632 --> 20:27.577
Turns out I do like online shopping.

20:31.886 --> 20:33.747
Wow.

20:36.253 --> 20:38.322
Well, maybe that’s for the best.

20:38.347 --> 20:40.724
You know what? Yeah, you’re right.
I mean, were brothers.

20:40.749 --> 20:42.331
Right.

20:43.228 --> 20:44.369
Oh, please, not again.

20:44.957 --> 20:46.124
Okay,

20:46.324 --> 20:48.465
lets just look and say
the names on three.

20:48.490 --> 20:49.589
- Ready?
- Okay.

20:49.622 --> 20:52.441
One... two... three.

20:52.466 --> 20:54.167
- Laura! Tracey!
- Oh, God, thank you.
