WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.765
<i>Go, Thomas!
Kick it, T. M! Kick it.</i>

00:03.521 --> 00:06.580
Now what do we do? Don't
ask me. You've got the gun.

00:07.858 --> 00:10.656
<i>You see, it's my little
sister. She's missing.</i>

00:11.429 --> 00:13.454
I need to know something
about her. What does she do?

00:13.531 --> 00:15.590
<i>She's a hooker, like me.</i>

00:16.100 --> 00:18.432
I was looking
to get my rug shampooed.

00:18.502 --> 00:19.969
<i>Boy, you've come
to the right place.</i>

00:20.037 --> 00:21.402
She almost got me killed.

00:21.472 --> 00:23.235
I thought that was behind us.

00:24.742 --> 00:25.834
And you're beginning
to annoy me.

00:25.910 --> 00:27.377
It could get worse.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.331
<i>Appearances
can sometimes be deceiving.</i>

01:48.408 --> 01:49.705
<i>For instance, it may have looked</i>

01:49.776 --> 01:53.576
<i>like Rick, T.C., Kenny and I were having
a whole lot of fun as we ran our hearts out</i>

01:53.646 --> 01:58.015
<i>training for the King Kamehameha
Club Charity Track and Field Games.</i>

01:58.551 --> 02:00.451
<i>Well, yeah, we were having fun.</i>

02:00.520 --> 02:04.115
<i>But the word "fun" hardly
describes the feeling you get</i>

02:04.190 --> 02:07.717
<i>when you know your body is
as finely tuned as it can be.</i>

02:08.061 --> 02:11.326
<i>Every muscle working in complete
coordination with the other,</i>

02:11.397 --> 02:15.299
<i>instantly reacting to the spontaneous
impulses emitting from the brain,</i>

02:15.368 --> 02:17.268
<i>a perfect mesh of body and mind.</i>

02:17.704 --> 02:19.763
<i>Go, Thomas!
Kick, it, T. M! Kick it!</i>

02:20.273 --> 02:23.504
<i>Then, you know what the word
"invincible" really means.</i>

02:35.154 --> 02:37.622
<i>Hey, man, don't try and get up.</i>

02:37.690 --> 02:38.714
<i>Take it easy, buddy.</i>

02:38.791 --> 02:42.158
<i>Get some ice, little brother.
Twisted, huh, Thomas?</i>

02:43.329 --> 02:45.263
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.696
<i>Oh, that's a shame.</i>

02:48.368 --> 02:50.632
Looks like Duke's gonna
have to take your place.

02:50.703 --> 02:52.933
Duke will not have to
take my place. I'll be fine.

02:53.005 --> 02:54.336
I'll just walk it off.

02:54.607 --> 02:55.596
<i>Come on, T.C.</i>

02:57.610 --> 03:00.636
I don't think you should
walk on it too soon.

03:04.283 --> 03:06.080
<i>Oh, Jeez.</i>

03:06.552 --> 03:08.315
Here comes Duke now
with the ice.

03:23.035 --> 03:24.969
It's just a minor sprain!

03:25.037 --> 03:27.665
<i>Two longnecks, one ice tea,
and bring a bag of ice.</i>

03:27.740 --> 03:29.207
Right away.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.867
I'll be fine for the race. Come on!

03:32.945 --> 03:34.810
<i>You know, I don't know.</i>

03:36.916 --> 03:40.443
<i>At your age, these kind of
things take longer to heal.</i>

03:40.520 --> 03:43.421
<i>What do you mean, "at my age"?
My age is your age, too!</i>

03:43.489 --> 03:45.218
Nothing wrong with my ankles.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.418
<i>Look, Thomas, I think what
T.C.'s trying to tell you</i>

03:47.493 --> 03:50.291
<i>is if your ankle isn't any
better by this time next week,</i>

03:50.363 --> 03:52.831
<i>well, we'll have to get
Kenny's younger brother, Duke.</i>

03:52.899 --> 03:54.161
Then we can still win the race.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.064
<i>Yeah. Besides,
he's faster than you.</i>

03:56.135 --> 03:57.762
<i>No, he isn't!</i>

04:00.473 --> 04:03.340
<i>Well, he's faster
than you guys, too.</i>

04:03.476 --> 04:04.807
Yes.

04:05.077 --> 04:06.544
But all of our ankles work.

04:06.612 --> 04:08.011
<i>Oh, come on, give me a break.</i>

04:08.080 --> 04:10.173
<i>Oh, shoot!
I'm sorry.</i>

04:10.783 --> 04:12.011
<i>Here, let me...</i>

04:12.952 --> 04:13.941
You?

04:14.020 --> 04:15.009
It's me.

04:15.087 --> 04:16.577
<i>Hi, Thomas.</i>

04:16.956 --> 04:18.286
Leslie?

04:19.192 --> 04:21.922
<i>It was kind of
inevitable, wasn't it?</i>

04:22.762 --> 04:24.093
What was?

04:24.163 --> 04:27.326
<i>Us bumping into each
other again, so to speak.</i>

04:28.835 --> 04:30.268
What's going on?

04:30.336 --> 04:31.598
I guess I forgot to tell you.

04:31.671 --> 04:32.729
I guess so.

04:33.272 --> 04:34.830
<i>Well, Leslie came back into town</i>

04:34.907 --> 04:36.135
and she kind of needed a job.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.471
<i>So I figured hey, what the hell,</i>

04:37.543 --> 04:39.010
after everything
that she did for you

04:39.111 --> 04:40.408
when you were
a hotel investigator.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.675
<i>Detective. Well, whatever. Anyway, she...</i>

04:42.748 --> 04:45.148
<i>Anyway, she almost
got me killed.</i>

04:46.452 --> 04:47.441
<i>Well, you did!</i>

04:47.520 --> 04:49.784
I thought that was behind us.

04:49.856 --> 04:53.587
<i>Look, I got a real job now, a straight job,</i>

04:53.659 --> 04:55.957
and I was just kind of hoping
that once you knew that...

04:56.028 --> 04:57.256
<i>She's right, man.</i>

04:57.330 --> 04:59.628
<i>I mean, the Vice Squad can't
arrest her for serving drinks.</i>

04:59.699 --> 05:01.428
<i>Unless, of course,
she serves drinks to minors.</i>

05:01.501 --> 05:03.025
<i>But you hardly qualify for that,</i>

05:03.102 --> 05:04.967
because most kids
have good ankles.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.238
You were hoping for what?

05:08.307 --> 05:11.674
Whoops! I forgot. I got to meet
Higgins in the Anuenue Room.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.769
He's got some English blokes
lined up

05:13.846 --> 05:15.871
for an aerial tour
of the Islands.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.849
<i>Well, it was nice
seeing you again. Bye!</i>

05:18.918 --> 05:20.783
<i>Rick? Um, I gotta help him coordinate.</i>

05:20.853 --> 05:22.616
And stay off that gam!

05:28.194 --> 05:30.219
You don't look
very happy to see me.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.890
<i>No, that's not true.
It's just kind of a shock.</i>

05:32.965 --> 05:35.365
A shock! How?
What way?

05:35.434 --> 05:38.631
<i>Well, I mean,
to find you here, working.</i>

05:38.704 --> 05:40.399
A job where I stand up?

05:40.473 --> 05:42.338
No! Working here.

05:45.578 --> 05:48.172
<i>I'm so happy
you said that, Thomas.</i>

05:49.315 --> 05:50.873
<i>Hey, honey, how about another round?</i>

05:51.784 --> 05:54.116
<i>Coming right up.
Mai tais, right?</i>

05:54.186 --> 05:55.210
You got a good memory.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.277
Thanks.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.987
<i>Look, I'll call you later,
explain everything.</i>

06:00.059 --> 06:02.391
There's something really important
that I want to talk to you about.

06:02.461 --> 06:04.361
Can you get me a beer?

06:04.997 --> 06:06.259
Sure!

06:07.867 --> 06:10.335
You know something? My
memory's not so bad either.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.428
You're beginning to look
real familiar.

06:12.505 --> 06:14.564
<i>Oh, all waitresses
look the same.</i>

06:14.640 --> 06:16.073
<i>Nah, I've seen you someplace.</i>

06:16.142 --> 06:18.007
<i>Come on, man, take it easy. I have!</i>

06:18.077 --> 06:19.669
<i>You're real distinctive, lady.</i>

06:19.745 --> 06:22.339
<i>Mister, I have only been
in Hawaii for two days.</i>

06:22.415 --> 06:24.042
I have never seen you before.

06:24.116 --> 06:27.347
I think you're wrong! I think you
know exactly where you've seen me.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.115
Why don't you let the lady do her job?

06:29.855 --> 06:31.550
<i>Say what, friend?</i>

06:31.624 --> 06:34.354
<i>I said, why don't you let the
lady do her job? All right?</i>

06:34.427 --> 06:35.894
<i>Thomas, it's okay.
Hey!</i>

06:35.962 --> 06:38.055
Why don't you mind your
own business? I'm trying.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.324
Thomas!

06:39.398 --> 06:41.593
<i>So, honey, when do you get off?</i>

06:41.667 --> 06:43.726
<i>Oh, come on.
That's it!</i>

06:43.803 --> 06:46.567
<i>Now, look.
Please leave now!</i>

06:46.639 --> 06:48.368
<i>Hey, you can't tell me to leave!</i>

06:48.441 --> 06:50.671
<i>My name is Ron Phillips,
I'm a member here.</i>

06:50.743 --> 06:51.835
And you're beginning
to annoy me.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.105
It could get worse.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.170
<i>Hey, that's a threat! Did you
hear that? He's threatening me!</i>

06:55.247 --> 06:57.215
<i>No, I'm not threatening you.
I'm asking you very politely,</i>

06:57.283 --> 07:00.218
<i>before I call the manager,
to please leave now!</i>

07:00.286 --> 07:02.550
Thomas! Just a minute. I'm handling this.

07:05.324 --> 07:06.416
Hey!

07:06.492 --> 07:07.584
I'll kill you!

07:18.137 --> 07:20.935
I'll punch you silly!
I'll rip your hair out!

07:21.140 --> 07:22.539
I'll rip your eyes out!

07:36.255 --> 07:38.382
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

07:39.825 --> 07:41.452
How could you?

07:41.794 --> 07:43.284
<i>You broke my nail, you creep!</i>

07:43.362 --> 07:45.125
Police officer!
Freeze!

07:46.565 --> 07:47.725
<i>That was positively</i>

07:47.800 --> 07:49.893
<i>the most disgraceful exhibition
that I have ever seen!</i>

07:50.302 --> 07:54.068
Even rivaling the time that you unleashed
that python at Mr. Masters' dinner party!

07:54.140 --> 07:56.506
I didn't unleash it!
I was on a case.

07:56.575 --> 07:57.564
A woman fainted!

07:57.643 --> 07:59.838
The right woman! It worked.

08:00.379 --> 08:03.143
<i>Perhaps then, in that instance,
there was some justification.</i>

08:03.215 --> 08:05.274
Today's debacle at the Club
had none.

08:05.351 --> 08:08.684
I am therefore suspending your
privileges there for one month!

08:08.754 --> 08:10.483
You can't do that!
I'll call Robin!

08:10.556 --> 08:14.048
I am quite certain that
he will support my stand.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.187
<i>By the by, have you had
that ankle looked at?</i>

08:18.264 --> 08:19.561
No!

08:19.632 --> 08:20.963
You should.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.797
<i>At your age, these things
can take a long time to heal.</i>

08:23.869 --> 08:27.600
<i>Higgins, I happen to come from
a long line of fast healers.</i>

08:27.707 --> 08:28.867
<i>If it's not in shape,</i>

08:28.974 --> 08:32.740
<i>I hear that Kenny's younger brother,
Duke, has an amazing closing kick.</i>

08:33.679 --> 08:34.804
<i>Perhaps, for the good
of the team,</i>

08:34.880 --> 08:36.404
you should consider
withdrawing from the race.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.575
I am not withdrawing!

08:38.650 --> 08:41.586
<i>Well, I am.
Good day, Magnum.</i>

08:48.360 --> 08:50.487
<i>Is he gone?
Yes, he's gone!</i>

08:50.963 --> 08:52.692
<i>Well, what's that supposed to mean? What?</i>

08:53.899 --> 08:56.129
Nothing. I was just
answering your question.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.329
<i>You want me to go, too?</i>

08:58.404 --> 09:00.929
<i>That's what it sounded like.
Look, I can take a hint.</i>

09:01.006 --> 09:02.166
I didn't say that.

09:02.241 --> 09:03.265
<i>Well, you meant it.</i>

09:03.342 --> 09:04.741
I didn't mean anything!

09:04.810 --> 09:06.243
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

09:06.312 --> 09:08.280
So you couldn't use the clutch
and I had to drive you home.

09:08.347 --> 09:10.577
But you're not stuck
with me. I'll call a cab.

09:10.649 --> 09:14.244
<i>Oh, come on, Leslie! Put
that down. Please, come on.</i>

09:17.089 --> 09:18.920
<i>Leslie, I don't know
what it is between you and me,</i>

09:18.991 --> 09:22.427
but we don't seem to be able to
spend five minutes in the same place

09:22.495 --> 09:25.726
without screaming
or storming out on each other.

09:26.031 --> 09:28.625
I like you. I really do.

09:28.701 --> 09:31.864
<i>And I really admire what you're
trying to do with your life, but...</i>

09:33.305 --> 09:37.742
We just seem to rub each other the
wrong way. You know what I mean?

09:40.146 --> 09:43.081
<i>Yeah, you're probably right.</i>

09:44.717 --> 09:47.914
We're kind of like oil
and orange juice sometimes.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.986
<i>Yeah, you're right.</i>

09:52.057 --> 09:53.957
I'll just keep trying
with my job.

09:54.026 --> 09:57.257
<i>After all, you can't go near
the place anyway for a month,</i>

09:57.329 --> 10:00.230
and then we'll just see
what happens. Okay?

10:01.834 --> 10:03.802
Okay. Friends?

10:05.037 --> 10:06.231
Sure.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.140
<i>Oh, there's one thing I forgot.</i>

10:11.477 --> 10:13.775
Remember I said I wanted to
talk to you about something

10:13.846 --> 10:16.007
just before you got
sucker-punched?

10:16.081 --> 10:19.312
<i>Yeah, I remember. What
did you want to talk about?</i>

10:19.785 --> 10:23.346
I want to talk to you about
seeing me professionally.

10:25.658 --> 10:26.852
<i>Nope, that came out wrong.</i>

10:26.926 --> 10:28.951
I mean you professionally.

10:29.028 --> 10:32.589
<i>I want to hire you, Thomas,
as a private investigator.</i>

10:33.065 --> 10:35.295
<i>You see, it's my little sister.</i>

10:35.367 --> 10:37.460
She called and left a message
that she was in trouble

10:37.536 --> 10:39.504
and now she's missing.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.070
I need your help.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.682
Do you really have to do that?

10:53.518 --> 10:54.985
<i>It makes me feel better,</i>

10:56.120 --> 10:58.111
and it should make you
feel better.

10:58.189 --> 10:59.816
<i>You are where you live,
you know.</i>

10:59.891 --> 11:01.222
Hmm.

11:02.160 --> 11:06.221
<i>Leslie, tell me something.
Do you really have a sister?</i>

11:06.297 --> 11:07.559
Yes!

11:07.665 --> 11:11.658
<i>Well, I just thought I'd ask, 'cause
last time you kind of overwhelmed me</i>

11:11.736 --> 11:15.433
<i>with stories about grandmothers,
and kidney machines, and...</i>

11:15.506 --> 11:18.031
And anything else I could
think of to get you to help me.

11:18.109 --> 11:22.307
<i>Besides, embellishments just kind
of come naturally to me, I guess.</i>

11:22.747 --> 11:24.374
But this is real.

11:24.448 --> 11:26.882
<i>Patty is very real, and
I want you to find her.</i>

11:29.020 --> 11:30.248
How old is she?

11:33.191 --> 11:34.715
Twenty-two.

11:37.228 --> 11:38.786
Twenty-three?

11:40.464 --> 11:42.125
<i>Well, it's been a few years.</i>

11:42.200 --> 11:44.930
<i>Yes, it sounds like you come
from a very close family.</i>

11:45.002 --> 11:48.563
<i>Well, the family may not be
close, but Patty and I are.</i>

11:48.639 --> 11:50.504
And when was the last time
you saw her?

11:51.242 --> 11:52.402
<i>Um,</i>

11:52.977 --> 11:54.171
1978.

11:54.612 --> 11:57.672
<i>Sorry, no, that was Mary
I haven't seen since '78.</i>

11:57.748 --> 11:59.875
We're also a large family.

12:00.184 --> 12:02.482
Just show you this.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.450
<i>That's Patty, and that's me.</i>

12:08.926 --> 12:11.417
<i>Yeah, it has been a few years.</i>

12:11.629 --> 12:13.290
<i>But we talk, though.</i>

12:13.364 --> 12:14.353
Sometimes.

12:15.166 --> 12:17.430
I want to understand this.
I really do.

12:17.501 --> 12:19.969
<i>Uh, you've moved back to Hawaii.</i>

12:20.037 --> 12:21.937
Then you conned Rick
into giving you a job

12:22.006 --> 12:24.702
<i>you have no evident aptitude
or inclination for,</i>

12:24.775 --> 12:28.575
so you could hire me
to find an alleged sister

12:28.646 --> 12:30.443
who you haven't seen
for years. Am I close?

12:30.514 --> 12:31.572
I knew you'd say no.

12:31.649 --> 12:33.674
I didn't say no!
Yet.

12:33.751 --> 12:36.413
Why did you go through
this circuitous route?

12:36.487 --> 12:38.546
Why didn't you just
call and ask me?

12:38.623 --> 12:40.614
Because this is
precisely the attitude

12:40.691 --> 12:42.886
<i>I would have expected
from you, Thomas.</i>

12:42.960 --> 12:44.757
Precisely. I knew it.

12:44.829 --> 12:45.921
I guess I just stupidly thought

12:45.997 --> 12:48.124
<i>that if you saw me making
an honest effort at life,</i>

12:48.199 --> 12:49.461
<i>with a straight job
and everything,</i>

12:49.533 --> 12:51.194
that you would
take me seriously.

12:51.269 --> 12:54.761
<i>Now, that, Leslie, that is
precisely the kind of logic</i>

12:54.839 --> 12:56.830
that always seems
to get you in trouble.

12:56.907 --> 12:59.967
<i>Now, if you'd just been
direct with me, I would have...</i>

13:00.044 --> 13:01.602
Said no.

13:01.679 --> 13:02.839
That's not true.

13:02.913 --> 13:06.314
<i>All right, I'll be direct.
I'll be real direct.</i>

13:07.118 --> 13:09.143
I've always been pretty selfish.

13:09.220 --> 13:11.950
<i>Looked out for number one, let
the world take care of itself.</i>

13:12.023 --> 13:15.481
<i>But right now, my sister is out there
somewhere, in trouble, maybe hurt,</i>

13:15.559 --> 13:18.255
and the only person
that can help her is me.

13:18.329 --> 13:21.765
And I just thought that the only
person that could help me was you.

13:21.832 --> 13:23.732
But I can understand if you
don't want to get involved.

13:23.801 --> 13:24.961
It's not your problem.

13:25.069 --> 13:26.502
<i>I gave it my best shot
and you said no,</i>

13:26.570 --> 13:28.629
so I guess I'll just have to
go on by myself.

13:28.706 --> 13:30.037
<i>Leslie, wait!</i>

13:30.107 --> 13:31.506
But I will go on by myself

13:31.575 --> 13:34.669
<i>because, for once in my life, I'd like
to think that I did the right thing!</i>

13:34.745 --> 13:36.007
<i>Leslie, wait!</i>

13:36.080 --> 13:38.048
For no other reason except
the fact... I can't keep up!

13:38.115 --> 13:39.309
<i>That somebody really needs me,</i>

13:39.383 --> 13:41.908
and I put aside my own petty
problems to help them out.

13:41.986 --> 13:44.819
<i>Leslie, I'm trying
to tell you I'll do it!</i>

13:48.592 --> 13:50.355
<i>Thank you, Thomas.</i>

13:50.895 --> 13:52.385
You're welcome!

13:52.463 --> 13:55.899
<i>Now, I need to know something
about her. What does she do?</i>

13:56.334 --> 13:58.768
<i>Um, she's a hooker, like me.</i>

14:03.007 --> 14:05.271
<i>I'm not exactly sure
why I agreed</i>

14:05.343 --> 14:08.403
<i>to help Leslie find
this missing sister of hers.</i>

14:08.479 --> 14:11.277
<i>But, then again, maybe I am.</i>

14:11.515 --> 14:15.815
<i>Maybe it all goes back to the
"appearances can be deceiving" syndrome.</i>

14:15.886 --> 14:18.855
<i>I mean, yes, Leslie has
embellished in the past,</i>

14:18.923 --> 14:21.255
<i>to the point of
nearly getting me killed.</i>

14:21.325 --> 14:25.125
<i>But I had a feeling that this
time she wasn't embellishing,</i>

14:25.196 --> 14:28.688
<i>that she really was determined
to help her sister out.</i>

14:28.933 --> 14:32.391
<i>Besides, when you have a car
like a Ferrari, well,</i>

14:32.470 --> 14:34.904
<i>just like a racehorse,
it needs a workout.</i>

14:34.972 --> 14:37.532
<i>Leslie, this is the fourth time</i>

14:37.608 --> 14:39.838
that we have been
around the block!

14:39.910 --> 14:42.276
Are you forgetting the address?

14:42.346 --> 14:44.109
<i>No, I did not forget
the address.</i>

14:44.181 --> 14:46.012
I just want to
make sure it's clear.

14:46.083 --> 14:48.517
<i>Ah! Now, this is what
I'm talking about, Leslie.</i>

14:48.586 --> 14:52.113
You have to be more direct. You
just want to make sure what is clear?

14:52.189 --> 14:53.554
The coast!
What coast?

14:53.624 --> 14:56.855
To Cleo's apartment!
Remember her? My friend.

14:58.262 --> 15:01.197
<i>Besides, if her pimp's
around, forget it.</i>

15:02.199 --> 15:03.996
<i>But that's why
you're here, right?</i>

15:05.302 --> 15:07.327
Never mind. Okay.

15:08.339 --> 15:10.034
<i>Now, this is
a very powerful car,</i>

15:10.107 --> 15:12.302
it's going to be hard
to maneuver. Be careful.

15:39.036 --> 15:42.472
My horoscope for the month said
to get ready for some surprises.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.508
<i>Well, I just got that.</i>

15:44.575 --> 15:46.873
<i>But it also said
I'd be marrying rich, too.</i>

15:47.645 --> 15:50.512
<i>Oh, well, one out of two
ain't bad, I guess.</i>

15:50.614 --> 15:54.072
<i>Leslie, honey, you are
flooring me. A waitress?</i>

15:55.386 --> 15:57.911
<i>And the former
hotel detective, too.</i>

15:58.055 --> 16:00.046
Aw! You're
still cute.

16:00.124 --> 16:01.352
Thank you.

16:01.425 --> 16:03.655
<i>And you're still
ducking me, Cleo.</i>

16:03.727 --> 16:05.319
What do you know about Patty?

16:06.163 --> 16:07.323
That depends.

16:07.398 --> 16:09.889
<i>Please, Cleo, I gotta find her!</i>

16:09.967 --> 16:12.333
<i>A whole lot of people
are thinking that way, too.</i>

16:13.237 --> 16:16.798
<i>But if you're going to bring
muscle, which you're going to need,</i>

16:16.874 --> 16:18.307
you should've brought one
that can walk.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.240
<i>He'll do.
Won't he, though.</i>

16:20.311 --> 16:23.075
<i>Cut it out, Cleo!
He's working! For me!</i>

16:23.147 --> 16:25.138
<i>Okay, okay, I'm sorry.</i>

16:25.382 --> 16:27.145
It's just that sometimes...

16:27.451 --> 16:28.782
Never mind.

16:29.787 --> 16:31.254
Patty!

16:31.322 --> 16:34.155
That was taken at the Prince
Kuhio Fair three weeks ago.

16:35.092 --> 16:37.151
Which was the last time
you heard from her. Right!

16:37.228 --> 16:39.389
Which was the last time
anybody ever heard from her.

16:40.764 --> 16:44.928
<i>I don't know if you know this, but
she was working down in Waikiki,</i>

16:45.402 --> 16:47.734
and word has it she was
skimming from her man.

16:47.805 --> 16:48.965
Oh!

16:49.039 --> 16:50.529
What happened?

16:50.608 --> 16:52.633
What usually happens.

16:52.710 --> 16:55.372
<i>Wherever she is on this rock, I
wouldn't want to be under there with her,</i>

16:55.446 --> 16:56.674
that's all I can say.

16:59.049 --> 17:00.880
Who's her "man"?

17:01.952 --> 17:04.682
He calls himself
"The Mighty Flinn."

17:05.522 --> 17:07.047
<i>Oh, hell!</i>

17:12.429 --> 17:13.953
<i>Uh, Cleo,</i>

17:15.165 --> 17:16.462
who is he?

17:16.534 --> 17:19.992
<i>I don't know who he is,
but I know what he is.</i>

17:20.804 --> 17:21.964
Take care of her.

17:22.039 --> 17:23.336
<i>Well, where do I find him?</i>

17:24.241 --> 17:26.300
He usually finds you.

17:28.378 --> 17:29.710
Thanks.

17:32.082 --> 17:33.572
<i>Um,</i>

17:34.718 --> 17:35.946
call me?

17:36.720 --> 17:38.017
Sometimes?

17:56.006 --> 17:59.169
<i>Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,</i>

17:59.243 --> 18:01.438
<i>twenty, twenty-one...</i>

18:01.512 --> 18:02.911
All right!

18:02.980 --> 18:04.311
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

18:04.448 --> 18:06.143
<i>Hey, Thomas.
How's the ankle?</i>

18:06.216 --> 18:08.844
<i>Oh, better. I ought to...
Get some rest.</i>

18:08.919 --> 18:11.149
<i>I mean, Duke is really
tearing up the splits.</i>

18:11.855 --> 18:13.823
I'll be fine.
I'll be ready for the race.

18:14.592 --> 18:17.527
<i>Well, we don't want
to rush things.</i>

18:17.595 --> 18:19.028
<i>I mean, if we have
a winning combination,</i>

18:19.096 --> 18:22.554
we don't want to mess it up just
because of a foolish sense of pride.

18:22.633 --> 18:25.067
Pride's got nothing
to do with it!

18:25.536 --> 18:27.470
I'll let you guys talk.

18:29.306 --> 18:31.137
How could you guys?

18:31.208 --> 18:32.232
How could we what?

18:32.309 --> 18:34.709
How could you try and
manipulate me out of this race?

18:36.380 --> 18:38.439
Because we want to win!

18:39.316 --> 18:42.308
<i>Well, okay, fine. I won't anchor.
I'm still faster than Rick.</i>

18:42.386 --> 18:44.547
<i>Um, speed isn't everything, Thomas.</i>

18:44.622 --> 18:46.817
At least my ankle and I will finish.

18:48.025 --> 18:51.256
<i>Oh, by the way, I got that info
you wanted on that Flinn guy.</i>

18:51.328 --> 18:52.795
<i>He's one tough customer, baby.</i>

18:52.863 --> 18:56.196
<i>According to Ice Pick, he keeps the
obit sections in the newspaper alive.</i>

18:56.266 --> 18:57.597
So I've been told.
Where is he?

18:57.668 --> 18:58.930
At his business.

18:59.003 --> 19:00.766
And I bet you
I know what that is.

19:00.838 --> 19:03.136
Probably some waterfront dive
or gambling parlor...

19:03.207 --> 19:06.665
<i>Uh, he runs a rug
shampooing business.</i>

19:08.545 --> 19:10.410
Thanks.
Thank Ice Pick.

19:10.481 --> 19:12.005
But I don't think
he did you any favors.

19:16.453 --> 19:18.546
Tell him I'll be ready.

19:26.430 --> 19:28.398
Island Breeze.

19:30.234 --> 19:33.965
That reminds me of when Patty
and I played jump rope as kids.

19:34.571 --> 19:36.664
<i>Her favorite rhyme was,</i>

19:37.207 --> 19:42.076
"Tropical breeze tickles your
knees. How many islands can you see?

19:42.146 --> 19:45.377
<i>"One, two, three, four,
five, six...</i>

19:45.449 --> 19:48.043
<i>Leslie...
"seven, eight, nine..."</i>

19:49.253 --> 19:51.744
I get the idea. Wait here.

19:53.123 --> 19:54.112
I'll try.

19:54.191 --> 19:55.522
And don't move.

20:10.074 --> 20:12.440
Hi. Can I help you?

20:14.912 --> 20:17.608
I was looking
to get my rug shampooed.

20:17.881 --> 20:21.112
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, you've
come to the right place.</i>

20:37.935 --> 20:40.665
<i>Well, most of my business
is telephone order.</i>

20:40.738 --> 20:41.898
Who referred you?

20:41.972 --> 20:42.961
A friend.

20:45.209 --> 20:46.369
A good friend.

20:49.546 --> 20:51.673
<i>Easy on the soap, girls.</i>

20:52.216 --> 20:53.513
Uh-huh.

20:55.753 --> 20:58.153
<i>Look, fella, I need a reference.</i>

20:59.456 --> 21:00.855
<i>Okay, what's your name?</i>

21:02.059 --> 21:03.356
Randolph Williams.

21:04.128 --> 21:05.959
Randolph Williams.

21:06.029 --> 21:10.363
<i>Okay, you leave
a credit card or $200</i>

21:10.434 --> 21:12.197
<i>and just tell me when, okay?</i>

21:12.269 --> 21:13.930
And maybe who?

21:14.004 --> 21:16.734
<i>Look, pal, just one time,
in English.</i>

21:16.807 --> 21:20.299
<i>Well, my friend said
that the person who</i>

21:20.844 --> 21:23.472
cleaned his condo

21:23.547 --> 21:27.415
<i>was a young blonde about 22, 23,</i>

21:27.484 --> 21:30.510
and he said
she did a very good job.

21:31.555 --> 21:33.546
Doesn't ring a bell.
Maybe you should...

21:33.624 --> 21:36.957
Maybe I should talk to some of
your maintenance people. I...

21:39.563 --> 21:41.394
Hold it right there!
Where is she?

21:41.465 --> 21:42.727
That's my gun!

21:42.800 --> 21:43.824
Where's who?

21:43.901 --> 21:45.027
Where'd you get my gun?

21:45.102 --> 21:47.969
<i>I cleaned up your place, remember?
I must have stuck it in my purse.</i>

21:48.038 --> 21:51.303
<i>Patty Emory, my sister.
What did you do to her?</i>

21:51.375 --> 21:52.740
I think the two of you
better leave.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.243
Not until you start talking.

21:54.311 --> 21:56.472
<i>I think we better leave, too.</i>

21:56.547 --> 21:58.242
<i>Are you crazy?
No, you are!</i>

22:04.588 --> 22:06.021
What if we forget
the whole thing?

22:06.957 --> 22:08.049
No.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.319
Now what do we do?

22:09.393 --> 22:11.122
<i>Don't ask me,
you've got the gun.</i>

22:21.572 --> 22:23.369
<i>Come on, Thomas, let's go!</i>

22:33.450 --> 22:36.510
<i>Thomas, this is hardly the time to wimp out!</i>

22:37.087 --> 22:38.782
Just kidding.

22:40.490 --> 22:41.957
Come on!

22:53.535 --> 22:54.832
Leave now.

22:58.340 --> 22:59.932
<i>Okay, suffer.</i>

23:00.142 --> 23:01.336
But it's not gonna be my fault

23:01.410 --> 23:03.173
if you can't run in your
dumb race on Saturday.

23:03.245 --> 23:05.145
<i>Yes, it is.
Because of you, it's worse.</i>

23:05.981 --> 23:09.212
I'll have you know that I am
a certified physical therapist.

23:09.285 --> 23:11.219
I'm sure you are.

23:13.589 --> 23:16.149
Just exactly what
do you mean by that?

23:16.225 --> 23:18.489
Certifiable!
That's what I mean!

23:18.560 --> 23:21.290
<i>And you're completely
irresponsible, and crazy,</i>

23:21.363 --> 23:22.352
<i>and to make matters worse,</i>

23:22.431 --> 23:25.127
you made me break
Robin's antique walking stick!

23:25.334 --> 23:28.303
<i>Oh, big deal! I'm sure he's got another one.</i>

23:28.370 --> 23:29.632
Another one?

23:29.705 --> 23:31.172
<i>Another one?
Do you have any idea,</i>

23:31.240 --> 23:33.333
<i>any conception, of how hard
one of these...</i>

23:33.709 --> 23:35.939
<i>Never mind.
Just get out of my life, now!</i>

23:37.579 --> 23:39.069
On my way!

23:39.615 --> 23:41.105
On my way!

23:41.183 --> 23:43.947
<i>But I am still going to find
Patty, with you or without you.</i>

23:44.019 --> 23:45.213
<i>Oh, great! Good luck.</i>

23:45.287 --> 23:48.779
Just let the cops know who
the next of kin is to notify.

23:48.857 --> 23:50.950
Damn it! She is
my next of kin!

23:51.026 --> 23:53.790
<i>Leslie, please don't
break anything else.</i>

23:53.862 --> 23:55.523
But I really want to!

23:58.500 --> 23:59.524
Go ahead.

24:07.176 --> 24:11.704
<i>Leslie, just tell me why you
barged in there with my gun.</i>

24:11.780 --> 24:13.611
I guess I was trying
to be direct.

24:13.682 --> 24:15.115
<i>Oh, great.
That's wonderful.</i>

24:15.184 --> 24:17.152
<i>You know, that's
real improvement.</i>

24:17.219 --> 24:18.982
But what sense did it make?

24:19.054 --> 24:21.488
<i>You know, if Flinn
is also after Patty,</i>

24:21.557 --> 24:24.185
then he's not going to know
where she is either. Right?

24:24.259 --> 24:25.851
Right.
Right!

24:25.928 --> 24:28.624
<i>Now, my plan was to
talk to one of the girls.</i>

24:28.697 --> 24:31.598
That was the only way we were
going to get another clue.

24:31.667 --> 24:33.328
<i>Now all that's
been accomplished,</i>

24:33.402 --> 24:35.666
besides just about
getting both of us killed

24:35.738 --> 24:37.933
<i>and setting my ankle back
two more days,</i>

24:38.006 --> 24:40.998
<i>and breaking Robin's
antique walking stick,</i>

24:41.276 --> 24:44.973
is that Flinn is going to be
looking for her that much harder

24:45.047 --> 24:48.107
and you and I have
absolutely nothing to go on!

24:50.119 --> 24:51.746
"You and I"?

24:53.222 --> 24:56.191
Does that mean you're not quitting on me?

24:56.959 --> 24:58.187
<i>You're not, are you?</i>

25:00.796 --> 25:04.357
I think your shift starts at
the Club in about a half an hour.

25:04.466 --> 25:06.991
<i>Yeah, you're right,
I'd better...</i>

25:07.803 --> 25:09.532
<i>But then, how can I help you?</i>

25:09.605 --> 25:11.072
<i>You can't, you mustn't,
and you won't!</i>

25:11.140 --> 25:12.334
But...
But nothing!

25:12.408 --> 25:13.602
Take the Ferrari.

25:13.675 --> 25:15.768
But what about you?
You can't drive.

25:15.844 --> 25:18.005
I'll take the Audi.
It's an automatic.

25:20.449 --> 25:22.246
<i>Thank you, Thomas.</i>

25:23.819 --> 25:25.582
You're welcome.

25:26.522 --> 25:27.819
You know what?

25:27.890 --> 25:29.255
What?

25:29.324 --> 25:30.757
You're a knight.

25:31.193 --> 25:32.854
A knight in armor.

25:33.462 --> 25:37.398
<i>No, I'm not. I'm just a private
investigator doing his job</i>

25:38.233 --> 25:39.825
for a client he cares about.

25:40.536 --> 25:42.902
I'm going to find your sister.

25:44.039 --> 25:45.631
Thank you.

25:50.379 --> 25:51.869
<i>I know what you're
thinking, and you're right.</i>

25:51.947 --> 25:55.075
<i>I never should have borrowed such a
valuable antique in the first place.</i>

25:55.150 --> 25:58.313
<i>And if I had to explain it to him,
I knew Higgins would understand.</i>

26:02.324 --> 26:03.791
<i>Hi, Higgins.</i>

26:05.861 --> 26:07.226
That is my desk.

26:07.296 --> 26:08.456
<i>Yes, I know. I was just</i>

26:09.364 --> 26:11.355
relaxing for a minute.

26:11.433 --> 26:12.661
On my desk?

26:12.734 --> 26:14.429
Do you need it?

26:14.670 --> 26:16.763
It's quite irrelevant
whether I need it or not.

26:16.839 --> 26:21.105
The point is that one doesn't simply
lounge around on another man's desk.

26:21.176 --> 26:22.473
So you don't need it.

26:24.179 --> 26:26.340
<i>As a matter of fact, I do.</i>

26:34.990 --> 26:37.356
<i>Now, if you're quite finished
loafing about...</i>

26:39.094 --> 26:42.393
<i>Oh, Higgins.
You caught me red-handed.</i>

26:43.398 --> 26:46.458
I wasn't actually
relaxing on your desk.

26:47.669 --> 26:50.536
<i>I mean, you know how
important it is to the Club</i>

26:50.606 --> 26:52.369
that I run in that relay race.

26:52.441 --> 26:55.877
And you also know
that my ankle has been

26:55.944 --> 26:58.504
giving me a tiny
little bit of trouble.

26:58.580 --> 27:00.548
<i>So, I thought...
No.</i>

27:01.783 --> 27:02.943
"No" what?

27:03.018 --> 27:06.954
<i>Whatever it is of Robin's you
want to beg, borrow, or steal, no.</i>

27:07.256 --> 27:08.587
<i>Higgins, I...</i>

27:09.157 --> 27:10.590
I am hurt.

27:10.659 --> 27:14.220
<i>I mean, I didn't come here
to beg or borrow anything.</i>

27:14.296 --> 27:16.321
<i>I came here to ask you,</i>

27:16.498 --> 27:20.229
<i>as an expert in the field
of homeopathic medicine,</i>

27:20.302 --> 27:21.326
your advice.

27:21.403 --> 27:24.429
<i>Now, you can call that
stealing if you'd like.</i>

27:30.012 --> 27:31.877
You want my advice?

27:34.049 --> 27:36.677
Only if you want
to give it to me.

27:38.921 --> 27:41.389
<i>I'm sorry, Magnum,
I misjudged you.</i>

27:41.957 --> 27:43.049
<i>The ankle, is it?</i>

27:43.125 --> 27:44.422
Right.

27:44.893 --> 27:46.190
Quite.

27:47.029 --> 27:49.793
I do seem to recall
a similar incident.

27:51.667 --> 27:55.398
Where is that chapter
on Lizard Island?

27:58.206 --> 27:59.798
You don't mind
if I walk around a little?

27:59.875 --> 28:01.172
I just don't want it
to stiffen up.

28:01.243 --> 28:02.676
<i>I'm listening, though.</i>

28:04.980 --> 28:06.641
<i>Ah, here it is.</i>

28:07.749 --> 28:09.842
A young Kanaka boy
traveling with our unit

28:09.918 --> 28:14.412
fell down the river embankment into the
waiting jaws of a ravenous crocodile.

28:14.489 --> 28:17.754
<i>Naturally, I killed the crocodile
with one well-placed shot.</i>

28:17.826 --> 28:20.727
<i>But it took several hours to
pry the young lad's leg loose,</i>

28:20.796 --> 28:23.230
even though
the crocodile was dead.

28:23.298 --> 28:26.426
I formulated a concoction of
local herbs and river-bed clay

28:26.501 --> 28:28.492
<i>to put on the wound overnight,</i>

28:28.570 --> 28:33.166
<i>which, if I say so myself,
was a miraculous cure.</i>

28:37.145 --> 28:39.511
Some of the elements may be a
trifle difficult to come up with

28:39.581 --> 28:41.446
here on the Island.

28:41.516 --> 28:45.509
<i>However, I feel
quite certain that,</i>

28:45.988 --> 28:47.683
with a little persistence...

28:53.362 --> 28:55.057
It seems to be working already.

29:20.022 --> 29:24.686
<i>Okay, so I hadn't been completely
100º/º truthful with Higgins,</i>

29:25.027 --> 29:27.791
<i>and I had even stretched the
truth a little bit with Leslie</i>

29:27.863 --> 29:32.493
<i>when I told her we had absolutely nothing
to go on in terms of finding Patty.</i>

29:36.705 --> 29:39.799
<i>Even once I found a list of
employee records and various clients,</i>

29:39.875 --> 29:42.207
<i>that was still basically true.</i>

29:42.277 --> 29:45.303
<i>But at least it wasn't
absolutely nothing.</i>

30:10.338 --> 30:12.067
In here.
We'd better hurry!

30:19.948 --> 30:21.506
<i>How utterly fascinating.</i>

30:22.250 --> 30:26.209
<i>Some of the more prominent personages
on the Island are listed in this ledger,</i>

30:26.788 --> 30:28.619
including my accountant.

30:28.690 --> 30:30.157
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

30:30.225 --> 30:34.161
<i>Oh, and Ron Phillips, the guy
who started the fight at the Club.</i>

30:35.530 --> 30:38.590
And you contend that this Flinn

30:38.667 --> 30:40.396
was supplying them all with

30:41.136 --> 30:42.398
rug shampooers?

30:42.671 --> 30:44.832
Including my sister Patty.

30:45.507 --> 30:48.476
<i>Oh, by the way, Thomas, I
just wanted to thank you for...</i>

30:48.543 --> 30:50.067
Please don't.

30:51.046 --> 30:52.877
For what?
Nothing.

30:52.948 --> 30:54.245
For letting me take the Ferrari.

31:00.122 --> 31:01.987
<i>Higgins, could you just</i>

31:02.057 --> 31:05.117
<i>check this last name
on the list, J. Barnett,</i>

31:05.193 --> 31:06.455
see if it rings a bell?

31:06.528 --> 31:09.395
<i>His billing address is across
from the State Legislature,</i>

31:09.464 --> 31:11.830
<i>and if anybody'd know a guy like
that, it would certainly be you.</i>

31:11.900 --> 31:14.232
You let her drive the Ferrari?

31:14.870 --> 31:18.863
<i>See, uh, he was Patty's last
customer. That's the place to start.</i>

31:19.141 --> 31:21.837
<i>And his secretary wouldn't
take Thomas's call, so...</i>

31:25.480 --> 31:27.448
I'll see what I can do.

31:27.682 --> 31:29.912
<i>Great. Thanks,
Mr. Higgins.</i>

31:30.118 --> 31:31.983
About the Ferrari...

31:34.923 --> 31:36.686
I think he wants us
to leave the room.

31:48.103 --> 31:50.628
<i>Hello, Valerie?
This is Jonathan.</i>

31:51.072 --> 31:53.063
Is the Senator in?

31:54.843 --> 31:57.141
Jay Barnett
is a plastic lobbyist.

31:57.212 --> 31:59.646
You mean the little wind-up
kind with a key in his back?

31:59.714 --> 32:02.080
<i>If you're going to prevail upon
me to do your legwork for you,</i>

32:02.150 --> 32:04.914
then the least I would expect
is a minimum of silliness.

32:04.986 --> 32:07.853
<i>You're right. I'm sorry, Higgins. Go on.</i>

32:08.790 --> 32:11.452
<i>As a matter of fact, he represents
the entire plastics industry</i>

32:11.526 --> 32:13.289
in the State Legislature.

32:13.361 --> 32:15.761
He believes you to be a
representative of a Mainland company

32:15.831 --> 32:17.890
that wishes to relocate here.

32:17.966 --> 32:20.833
<i>Well, that's terrific.
Thank you, Higgins.</i>

32:23.772 --> 32:26.366
<i>Listen, you're not gonna</i>

32:26.908 --> 32:28.603
<i>get in any trouble
with this, are you?</i>

32:28.677 --> 32:32.078
<i>I mean, using your connections to get me
in to see this guy under false pretenses?</i>

32:32.147 --> 32:33.273
Probably.

32:34.049 --> 32:35.573
But your cause is worthy.

32:36.218 --> 32:39.585
<i>If he has anything to do with that
poor girl's disappearance, well,</i>

32:39.821 --> 32:42.255
I hope you nail
his miserable hide.

32:46.528 --> 32:47.552
Hello?

32:47.796 --> 32:49.559
<i>Yeah, it's me.
Is Leslie with you?</i>

32:50.298 --> 32:51.629
No. She went
to work.

32:51.700 --> 32:54.032
<i>Oh, yeah? Then, how come
she didn't show up?</i>

32:54.102 --> 32:55.330
She's really messing me up.

32:57.405 --> 32:58.997
I don't think
you're the only one.

33:00.842 --> 33:03.037
Leslie?
Yes! She did it again.

33:17.225 --> 33:20.058
<i>More on "appearances
can be deceiving."</i>

33:20.128 --> 33:21.823
<i>Sometimes they're not.</i>

33:21.897 --> 33:25.697
<i>Sometimes, no matter what
you try not to see in someone,</i>

33:25.767 --> 33:27.394
<i>it's still going to be there.</i>

33:27.469 --> 33:30.029
<i>Zebras still have stripes,
leopards spots,</i>

33:30.105 --> 33:33.370
<i>and Leslie, one thick-headed,
one-track mind.</i>

33:35.410 --> 33:38.004
<i>But at least I could be
thankful for a couple of things.</i>

33:38.079 --> 33:40.013
<i>Barnett's home address, for one,</i>

33:40.081 --> 33:41.981
<i>automatic transmission,
for another,</i>

33:42.050 --> 33:43.244
<i>and finally,</i>

33:43.351 --> 33:44.909
<i>I was thankful, in advance,</i>

33:44.986 --> 33:46.954
<i>for having the cleverness
and foresight</i>

33:47.022 --> 33:49.490
<i>to get to Barnett
before Leslie did.</i>

33:49.557 --> 33:53.015
Who is it? Thomas Magnum.
We have an appointment.

34:00.335 --> 34:01.666
Small world.

34:01.736 --> 34:04.569
It could get a lot smaller
if you don't get out of here.

34:04.639 --> 34:06.630
<i>What's the matter, Jay?</i>

34:08.576 --> 34:10.304
Get out of here!

34:11.079 --> 34:12.444
You two old friends?

34:13.681 --> 34:15.911
The first time I ever saw her
was the other day at the Club.

34:15.984 --> 34:18.885
<i>But my buddy Ron used to rent
her, if you want references.</i>

34:21.022 --> 34:23.956
What about that project
we were working on?

34:25.427 --> 34:27.121
I lost interest.

34:29.731 --> 34:31.755
Cancel the appointment.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.431
Cancel everything.

34:37.505 --> 34:39.029
What project?

34:39.373 --> 34:42.467
Nothing. I don't know
what he's talking about.

34:44.145 --> 34:47.308
Maybe you'd better tell me
who you really are.

34:52.002 --> 34:56.462
<i>Last and final postscript to
"appearances can be deceiving."</i>

34:56.540 --> 35:00.101
<i>Sometimes it's not worth figuring
out whether they are or not.</i>

35:00.177 --> 35:03.305
<i>For example, it could have
taken me weeks, maybe months,</i>

35:03.380 --> 35:05.940
<i>to sort through
the half-truths and white lies</i>

35:06.016 --> 35:09.884
<i>to find the real reason Leslie had
for being in Barnett's apartment.</i>

35:09.953 --> 35:13.389
<i>And then, I could start in
on the interesting stuff.</i>

35:13.457 --> 35:17.052
<i>Like, what was Leslie's real
relationship with the pimp named Flinn?</i>

35:17.127 --> 35:19.459
<i>And had she ever had
a sister named Patty?</i>

35:19.530 --> 35:22.431
<i>But I couldn't see why I
should spend one more minute</i>

35:22.499 --> 35:25.662
<i>trying to find the trees
through the forest of lies.</i>

35:25.836 --> 35:27.827
<i>Unless Leslie really was
in trouble</i>

35:27.905 --> 35:30.931
<i>and was trying to protect me
with that little act of hers.</i>

36:08.011 --> 36:10.741
<i>Sometimes I think life
would be a great deal easier</i>

36:10.814 --> 36:12.509
<i>without a little voice
nagging at me</i>

36:12.583 --> 36:15.051
<i>when things
don't seem just right.</i>

36:25.829 --> 36:28.821
<i>And once again, it looked like
my little voice was right.</i>

36:28.899 --> 36:32.630
<i>All I could hope for was that Leslie
had left me some kind of a clue.</i>

36:32.703 --> 36:34.967
<i>But I wasn't counting on much.</i>

36:45.682 --> 36:49.174
<i>Fortunately, that's usually
when I get a little lucky.</i>

36:49.253 --> 36:51.915
<i>"Tickles your knees,
Island Breeze."</i>

36:56.193 --> 37:00.391
<i>Obviously, Leslie had found a way to
leave me a message that Flinn had Patty,</i>

37:00.831 --> 37:02.321
<i>and maybe Leslie, too.</i>

37:02.399 --> 37:06.335
<i>But I knew that he wouldn't risk
hiding them out at his office.</i>

37:11.708 --> 37:14.506
<i>Especially when he had a
nice big warehouse tucked away</i>

37:14.578 --> 37:16.773
<i>in a rundown part of town.</i>

37:39.236 --> 37:40.999
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

37:41.071 --> 37:43.335
<i>Maybe most of this was my fault.</i>

37:43.407 --> 37:46.843
<i>After all, I'm the one
who told Leslie to be direct.</i>

37:47.210 --> 37:50.805
<i>But, on the other hand, I
didn't tell her to be too direct!</i>

37:50.881 --> 37:53.179
<i>Especially with the wrong guys.</i>

38:10.133 --> 38:12.499
<i>On the other hand,
I suppose it was possible</i>

38:12.569 --> 38:14.662
<i>that I was, in some
small way, responsible</i>

38:14.738 --> 38:18.902
<i>for Jay figuring out she had
ulterior motives for being there.</i>

38:19.676 --> 38:22.804
<i>But, on the other hand, despite
being hopelessly outnumbered,</i>

38:22.879 --> 38:24.369
<i>I did have a plan.</i>

38:24.815 --> 38:25.975
<i>A darn good one.</i>

38:29.052 --> 38:32.818
<i>One that could very well save
Leslie and her sister Patty.</i>

38:38.362 --> 38:40.922
<i>I don't care what you do,
just get rid of her!</i>

38:40.997 --> 38:42.328
I'm not exactly in the business

38:42.399 --> 38:45.197
of cleaning up after
sloppy politicians.

38:45.602 --> 38:47.365
My buddy Ron
told me you were reliable

38:47.704 --> 38:48.693
and discreet.

38:49.139 --> 38:52.506
<i>I do business with you one time,
and I got nothing but problems.</i>

38:52.576 --> 38:54.009
<i>Now, you do something about it,</i>

38:54.077 --> 38:57.410
or you're going to have to
find a new line of work.

39:39.689 --> 39:41.782
<i>Patty Emory, I presume?</i>

39:42.826 --> 39:45.090
<i>Hey! Shriners
convention, 1983!</i>

39:45.162 --> 39:46.595
<i>Shh! No, no, no.</i>

39:46.663 --> 39:48.096
You don't know me.

39:48.498 --> 39:51.797
But I'm kind of a friend
of your sister's.

39:52.903 --> 39:55.667
You're with Leslie! You
guys are here to rescue me!

39:55.739 --> 39:59.573
<i>Oh, God, I can't believe it!
I thought I was a dead person.</i>

40:00.377 --> 40:01.935
<i>Hey, what took you so long?</i>

40:02.479 --> 40:05.744
I hope you don't mind
the long route. Be careful.

40:26.236 --> 40:27.464
What about Leslie?

40:27.537 --> 40:29.664
I'll get to her in a minute.

40:29.739 --> 40:33.106
What the hell did you do to
get so many people mad at you?

40:33.176 --> 40:35.736
<i>Uh, nothing. Really.</i>

40:36.680 --> 40:39.706
<i>Well, Flinn sent me over
to Barnett's place.</i>

40:39.783 --> 40:41.114
So he and Barnett are connected?

40:41.184 --> 40:45.143
<i>No. No, I was just supposed to go over
there to deliver the weekly special,</i>

40:45.222 --> 40:47.053
if you know what I mean?

40:47.123 --> 40:48.590
<i>Anyway, I found some papers.</i>

40:48.658 --> 40:51.855
Some correspondence that would have
gotten Barnett in a whole lot of trouble

40:51.928 --> 40:55.921
unless he was willing to pay a
small finder's fee to recover them.

40:55.999 --> 40:57.626
So you're blackmailing Barnett?

40:57.701 --> 40:59.362
<i>Well, I kind of like
to think of it</i>

40:59.436 --> 41:02.132
as a shrewd financial move
to set myself up in business.

41:02.205 --> 41:05.470
Patty's Palmistry Parlor.
I give great readings.

41:08.278 --> 41:10.109
<i>All right, that's enough.</i>

41:10.180 --> 41:12.080
Now we're gonna have to get
rid of both of these dames.

41:12.148 --> 41:15.208
Great! I just don't want
to know anything about it.

41:15.285 --> 41:17.082
What exactly do you mean
by "get rid of"?

41:17.153 --> 41:19.087
Shut up! Now go get
the other one!

41:19.155 --> 41:20.281
<i>Come on, get her out of here!</i>

41:20.357 --> 41:21.790
Wait a minute!
Where am I going?

41:22.659 --> 41:24.024
Just because I'm a hooker

41:24.094 --> 41:26.187
doesn't mean I don't have a
right to my dreams-come-true.

41:26.263 --> 41:29.357
<i>I didn't say you didn't, but nobody's
gonna have any dreams come true</i>

41:29.432 --> 41:31.900
<i>unless I can get you and your
sister out of here. Now, wait here.</i>

41:31.968 --> 41:34.698
I have friends who know exactly where I am.

41:34.771 --> 41:36.136
And they're going to come
looking for me

41:36.206 --> 41:37.264
if I don't call in
in five minutes.

41:37.340 --> 41:38.637
<i>Hey, boss, she's gone!</i>

41:38.708 --> 41:40.141
<i>Well, find her, stupid!</i>

41:40.810 --> 41:42.141
What are we gonna do?

41:54.157 --> 41:55.249
Kenny!

42:44.240 --> 42:45.798
<i>Throw it in, Flinn.
It's over.</i>

43:02.792 --> 43:04.384
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

43:04.461 --> 43:07.089
I haven't had this much fun
since the 1968 State Fair

43:07.163 --> 43:10.360
when my sister Mary
won the hog-riding contest!

43:11.101 --> 43:12.966
Or was that Wendy?

43:13.637 --> 43:15.104
Bunny!

43:15.205 --> 43:16.672
Scooter?

43:16.840 --> 43:18.831
Scooter!
Bunny!

43:22.245 --> 43:24.440
I see you've met my sister.

43:26.116 --> 43:27.583
Bunny!

43:29.052 --> 43:30.349
<i>Oh, man.</i>

43:30.553 --> 43:32.418
<i>Duke, you okay?</i>

43:32.922 --> 43:34.890
I think I broke my leg.

43:38.161 --> 43:39.890
How's your ankle?

43:44.901 --> 43:49.600
<i>Welcome to the King Kamehameha
Club Charity Track and Field Games.</i>

43:49.873 --> 43:54.367
<i>The first event of the day, the 440-yard
relay, will begin in three minutes.</i>

44:11.594 --> 44:13.789
I brought you some water.

44:14.230 --> 44:17.393
I don't understand why you're not running
this race with the rest of your team.

44:17.467 --> 44:19.025
Why'd you tell them
I would do it?

44:19.102 --> 44:21.161
Because I made a deal.

44:21.538 --> 44:22.903
Huh?
I made a deal with Kenny.

44:22.972 --> 44:24.633
<i>He and his brother would
help me at the warehouse,</i>

44:24.708 --> 44:26.437
<i>and I would withdraw
from the race,</i>

44:26.509 --> 44:28.409
let Duke run instead.

44:29.345 --> 44:31.245
<i>Yeah, but Duke broke his ankle.</i>

44:31.314 --> 44:32.679
<i>That's their problem, not mine.</i>

44:32.749 --> 44:35.411
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going back to my seat.</i>

44:38.521 --> 44:41.081
Hey! Don't you think you're
being a little bit petulant?

44:41.157 --> 44:42.283
No!

44:43.393 --> 44:46.021
I think your pride
and ego are hurt.

44:46.096 --> 44:49.065
<i>I also think part of this
is you're mad at me, too.</i>

44:49.132 --> 44:53.466
You're mad because I stole Jay
Barnett's address and jumped the gun.

44:53.737 --> 44:55.967
<i>All right.
Yes, you're right.</i>

44:56.039 --> 44:58.530
Although this is hardly the
time or place to bring it up.

44:58.608 --> 45:01.805
Why in the hell would you
do something so stupid? Why?

45:01.878 --> 45:05.678
<i>I was just trying to do what
you told me to do, be direct.</i>

45:05.749 --> 45:07.478
<i>That's not direct,
that's stupid.</i>

45:09.285 --> 45:11.719
<i>Yeah, you're right.
It was stupid.</i>

45:12.122 --> 45:14.283
It was stupid of me
to almost get myself killed

45:14.357 --> 45:16.484
when I could've just waited
and let you handle it.

45:16.559 --> 45:19.619
But do you want to know
why I did something so stupid?

45:19.696 --> 45:21.721
More than I can tell you.

45:21.798 --> 45:26.258
The only reason I did something so
stupid is because I love my sister.

45:28.371 --> 45:30.134
<i>And I just felt that
the bottom line was,</i>

45:30.206 --> 45:32.936
<i>considering who we were
going up against,</i>

45:33.009 --> 45:36.911
<i>that if anybody was going to get
hurt, or worse, trying to get her back,</i>

45:36.980 --> 45:39.175
<i>I'd rather it be me than you,</i>

45:40.016 --> 45:42.382
because the other
bottom line here is

45:42.452 --> 45:45.148
<i>I kind of, in a weird way,
love you, too.</i>

45:48.958 --> 45:50.926
<i>Well, you don't have to be
that direct.</i>

45:51.661 --> 45:54.755
<i>Hey, you don't have to
take it so personally.</i>

45:55.131 --> 45:56.758
I love a lot of things.

45:56.833 --> 45:59.893
<i>Sunsets, piña coladas, do-wop.</i>

46:00.970 --> 46:03.438
I'd also love to see you run this damn race!

46:03.506 --> 46:05.167
<i>Runners to your marks.</i>

46:16.519 --> 46:17.952
<i>Set...</i>

46:29.098 --> 46:30.497
<i>Go get 'em, Thomas.</i>
