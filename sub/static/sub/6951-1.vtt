02:08.326 --> 02:12.038
Black cats and goblins
and broomsticks and ghosts.

02:12.247 --> 02:15.625
Pumpkins of witches are there to roast.

02:15.625 --> 02:19.129
You may think, they scare me.
You're probably right.

02:19.129 --> 02:22.132
Black cats and goblins
on Halloween night.

02:22.132 --> 02:23.842
Trick-or-treat!!!

02:44.529 --> 02:48.033
My parents won't be home until ten.
- Are you sure?

02:57.751 --> 02:59.252
We're all alone, aren't we?

03:00.128 --> 03:02.047
Michael's around someplace ...

03:03.423 --> 03:05.217
Take off that thing.

03:07.636 --> 03:09.638
Let's go upstairs.
- Ok.

04:32.053 --> 04:33.722
Look, Judith, it's very late.

04:33.722 --> 04:35.056
I gotta go.

04:35.056 --> 04:36.641
Will you call me tomorrow?

04:37.350 --> 04:39.352
Yeah, sure.
- Promise?

04:39.352 --> 04:40.353
Yeah.

05:47.921 --> 05:49.422
Michael?

06:29.254 --> 06:30.755
Michael?

07:45.455 --> 07:47.541
Ever done anything like this before?

07:48.750 --> 07:50.627
Only minimum security.

07:51.044 --> 07:52.420
I see.

07:54.548 --> 07:57.926
The driveway's a few hundred yards
up on the right.

07:59.845 --> 08:02.848
The only thing that ever bothers me
is their jibberish.

08:03.515 --> 08:06.518
When they start raving on and on ...

08:06.726 --> 08:09.229
You haven't anything to worry about.

08:09.521 --> 08:13.024
He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.

08:13.733 --> 08:15.735
Are there any special instructions?

08:16.319 --> 08:19.156
Just try to understand
what we're dealing with here.

08:19.823 --> 08:21.241
Don't underestimate it.

08:21.241 --> 08:24.244
Don't you think
we could refer to 'it' as him?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.746
If you say so.

08:27.747 --> 08:30.417
Your compassion's
overwhelming, Doctor.

08:37.924 --> 08:40.217
What do I give him, when we're taking him
in front of the judge?

08:41.052 --> 08:42.220
Thorazin.

08:44.054 --> 08:47.225
Barely be able to sit up.
- That's the idea.

08:57.027 --> 08:59.154
You're serious about that, aren't you?

08:59.654 --> 09:00.530
Yeah.

09:03.033 --> 09:07.037
You mean, you actually never want him to get out.
- Never ever ...

09:07.746 --> 09:08.622
Never.

09:09.539 --> 09:14.127
Then why we're taking up to Hardy county,
if he just gonna ... - Because that is the law.

09:15.754 --> 09:16.922
We are.

09:23.553 --> 09:25.847
Since when do they let them wander around?

09:28.016 --> 09:30.644
Pull up to the main gate.
- Shouldn't we ... - Pull up?

09:40.320 --> 09:41.530
Stop here.

09:45.242 --> 09:48.245
Shouldn't we go on up to the hospital on ...
- Wait!

10:47.220 --> 10:48.555
Are you all right?

10:48.555 --> 10:52.225
You all right?
- Yes, I'm ok. - He's gone. He's gone?

10:52.225 --> 10:53.852
The evil is gone!

10:59.149 --> 11:00.317
I gotta ...

11:59.126 --> 12:02.045
Don't forget to drop the key off
the Myers place ...

12:02.546 --> 12:03.922
I won't.

12:03.922 --> 12:08.927
They're coming by look at the house at 10:30.
Be sure you leave it under the mat ... - Promise.

12:42.419 --> 12:43.420
Laurie ...

12:45.255 --> 12:46.756
Hi Tommy.

12:49.217 --> 12:52.053
Coming over tonight?
- Same time, same place.

12:52.053 --> 12:54.055
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
- Sure.

12:54.055 --> 12:56.224
And watch the monster movies?
- Sure.

12:56.224 --> 12:57.517
Will you read to me?

12:57.517 --> 13:00.645
Can we make popcorn?
- Sure, sure, sure.

13:03.356 --> 13:04.733
You better hurry up.

13:06.234 --> 13:09.529
How can you walk in the school this way?
- My dad asked me to.

13:09.529 --> 13:10.739
Why?

13:10.739 --> 13:12.157
I have to drop off the key.

13:12.157 --> 13:13.241
Why?

13:13.241 --> 13:14.743
Because he's gonna sell a house.

13:14.743 --> 13:15.952
Why?

13:15.952 --> 13:18.038
Because that's his job.
- Where?

13:18.455 --> 13:19.456
The Meyers house.

13:19.456 --> 13:21.124
The Meyers house!

13:30.050 --> 13:31.927
You're not supposed to go up there?

13:31.927 --> 13:33.345
Yes, I am.

13:34.638 --> 13:36.348
That's a spook house.

13:36.723 --> 13:38.225
Just watch.

13:47.818 --> 13:50.320
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there.

13:50.821 --> 13:53.240
Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house.

13:53.240 --> 13:58.120
He said real awful stuff happened there once.
- Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the 6th grade.

13:58.453 --> 13:59.538
I gotta go.

13:59.538 --> 14:00.747
I see you tonight.

14:01.123 --> 14:02.624
Bye.
- Bye.

14:06.128 --> 14:10.715
# I wish I had you all alone ... #

14:11.049 --> 14:14.219
# Just the two of us ... #

14:16.221 --> 14:20.225
# I would hold you close to me ... #

14:21.017 --> 14:23.854
# So close to me ... #

14:26.148 --> 14:29.151
# Just the two ... #

14:31.027 --> 14:33.530
I'm not responsible, Sam. - Oh, no ...

14:33.530 --> 14:34.739
I told them how dangerous he was!

14:34.739 --> 14:38.452
You wouldn't have enough two roadblocks and
an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!

14:38.452 --> 14:41.538
But he was your patient, Doctor. If precautions
weren't strong enough, you should have told somebody.

14:41.538 --> 14:43.039
I told everybody!

14:43.039 --> 14:44.624
Nobody listened.
- There's nothing else I can do.

14:44.624 --> 14:46.918
You can get back in there
and get back on the telephone.

14:46.918 --> 14:49.045
Tell them exactly
who walked out of here last night ...

14:49.045 --> 14:51.631
And tell them exactly where he is going.
- Probably going.

14:51.631 --> 14:54.926
I'm wasting my time. - Sam, Haddonfield is
a hundred and fifty miles away from here.

14:54.926 --> 14:58.847
Now, now for God's sake, he can't drive a car!
- He was doing very well last night!

14:58.847 --> 15:01.224
Maybe someone around here gave him lessons.

15:05.353 --> 15:08.732
Doctor Chance, plese come to point C ...

15:09.024 --> 15:13.028
Doctor Chance, point C please.

15:13.653 --> 15:16.323
... and the book ends.

15:16.323 --> 15:20.952
But what Samuels is really talking about here ...

15:20.952 --> 15:22.746
is fate.

15:23.455 --> 15:24.748
You see ...

15:24.748 --> 15:29.044
fate caught up with several lives here.

15:29.628 --> 15:34.049
No matter what course of action Collins took ...

15:34.049 --> 15:37.719
he was destined to his own fate,

15:37.719 --> 15:41.723
his own day of reckoning with himself.

15:42.349 --> 15:44.142
The idea ...

15:44.142 --> 15:45.143
is ...

15:45.352 --> 15:47.145
that destiny ...

15:47.145 --> 15:53.026
is a very real, concrete thing
that every person has to deal with.

15:53.318 --> 15:59.032
How does Samuels' view of fate
differ from that of Costaine's? Laurie?

15:59.032 --> 15:59.616
M'am?

15:59.616 --> 16:01.451
Answer the question.

16:02.619 --> 16:06.623
Costaine wrote that fate--
was somehow related only to religion

16:06.748 --> 16:12.420
or where Samuels felt that ... well, fate was like
a natural element, like earth, air, fire, and water.

16:12.420 --> 16:16.133
That's right, Samuels definitely personified fate.

16:16.133 --> 16:20.137
In Samuels' writing, fate is a moveable like a mountain.

16:20.137 --> 16:23.640
It stands, where man passes a way.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.851
Fate never changes.

16:48.623 --> 16:50.750
You, with pumpkin.
- Leave me alone!

16:50.750 --> 16:57.132
He's gonna get you!
- He's gonna get you, he's gonna get you...

16:57.132 --> 16:59.926
The boogeyman is coming!
- Leave me alone!

16:59.926 --> 17:03.221
He doesn't believe us.
- Don't you know what happens on Halloween?

17:03.221 --> 17:05.557
Yeah, we get candy.

17:06.348 --> 17:13.356
The boogey man!
- The boogey man, the boogey man, the boogey ...

18:44.739 --> 18:46.158
He's on his way.

18:47.742 --> 18:51.538
You gotta believe me officer,
he is coming to Haddonfield.

18:52.747 --> 18:55.041
Because I know him.

18:55.625 --> 18:58.628
I'm his doctor. You must be ready for him.

19:00.255 --> 19:01.923
If you don't, it's your funeral.

19:54.142 --> 19:56.353
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder.

19:56.353 --> 19:58.730
Can't hear now, we yell a little louder.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.024
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder!

20:01.024 --> 20:02.526
Can't hear now ... continue
- Oh, look at you.

20:02.526 --> 20:06.029
Get off the books you have.
You neeed a shopping cart to get home.

20:08.031 --> 20:11.743
Heeey Haddonfield!
- Yeah, one for me.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.540
You know it's totally insane!
We have three new cheers to learn in the morning,

20:16.540 --> 20:19.626
the game in the afternoon, I have to get my hair
done at five and the dance is at eight.

20:19.626 --> 20:22.045
I'll be totally wiped out!

20:22.045 --> 20:24.548
I don't think get enough to do tommorow.
- Totally!

20:30.220 --> 20:35.225
As usual, I have nothing to do.
- It's your own fault and I don't feel bit sorry for you.

20:36.643 --> 20:38.854
Hey, Lynda, Laurie!

20:39.354 --> 20:40.856
Why didn't you wait for me?

20:40.856 --> 20:41.648
We did.

20:41.648 --> 20:46.027
Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed.
- That's not true. Here I am.

20:48.822 --> 20:52.617
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
- I'm never smiling again.

20:52.617 --> 20:58.039
Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell ...
- Exploring uncharted territory?- It's been totally charted.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.249
We just talked.

20:59.249 --> 21:00.417
Sure, sure.

21:00.417 --> 21:05.255
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs
and soaping windows. His parents grounded him.

21:05.255 --> 21:07.048
He can't come over tonight.

21:07.048 --> 21:11.052
I thought you were babysitting tonight. - The only reason
she babysits is to have a place to... - Oh shit ...

21:12.220 --> 21:14.222
I have a place for that.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.725
I forgot my chemistry book.

21:17.225 --> 21:21.730
So, who cares? I always forget my chemistry book
and my math book and my english book and my ...

21:21.730 --> 21:23.523
and let's see my French book and ...

21:23.523 --> 21:28.028
Who needs books anyway? I don't need books.
I always forget all of my books. I mean ...

21:28.028 --> 21:30.322
it doesn't really matter if I you got that books or not.

21:31.948 --> 21:33.742
Hey, isn't that the van Graham?

21:35.619 --> 21:36.953
I don't think so.

21:37.621 --> 21:39.247
I think he's cute.

21:43.543 --> 21:45.045
Hey, jerk ...

21:45.629 --> 21:47.756
Speed kills!

21:57.849 --> 21:59.851
Gosh ... Can't he take a joke?

22:07.651 --> 22:10.320
You know, Annie, some day
you gonna get us all into deep trouble.

22:13.323 --> 22:14.741
Totally.

22:14.741 --> 22:18.245
I hate a guy with a car and no sense of humor.

22:20.956 --> 22:22.916
Well, are we still on for tonight?

22:22.916 --> 22:25.919
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

22:25.919 --> 22:27.629
Oh come on, Annie ...

22:27.629 --> 22:30.048
Bob and I've been planning on it all week.

22:30.048 --> 22:31.550
All right.

22:31.925 --> 22:33.927
The Wallaces leave at seven.

22:33.927 --> 22:35.220
I'm babysitting the Doyles.

22:35.220 --> 22:40.225
It's only three houses down. We can keep each other
company. - Ohh, terrific ... I've got three choices.

22:40.225 --> 22:44.521
Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda
screw around or talk to you.

22:48.024 --> 22:50.318
We're so ma ...

22:50.318 --> 22:51.653
Here.

23:21.725 --> 23:23.351
What time at night?

23:23.351 --> 23:27.647
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my little
brother trick- or-treating. - Saving the treats for Bob?

23:27.647 --> 23:28.857
Fun-ny.

23:28.857 --> 23:31.026
See you.
- Bye. - Bye.

23:44.247 --> 23:45.540
Annie, look.

23:46.041 --> 23:47.250
Look where?

23:47.250 --> 23:48.627
Behind the bush.

23:50.253 --> 23:54.049
I don't see anything.
- That guy who drove by so fast, when you yelled at.

23:54.716 --> 23:56.635
Subtle, isn't he?

24:03.725 --> 24:05.519
Hey, creep!

24:08.355 --> 24:11.817
Laurie, dear, he wants to talk to you.

24:12.734 --> 24:15.153
He wants to take you out tonight.

24:29.751 --> 24:31.253
He was standing right there.

24:31.253 --> 24:32.921
Poor Laurie.

24:32.921 --> 24:35.257
Scared another one away.

24:35.924 --> 24:38.426
It's tragic. You never go out.

24:38.426 --> 24:43.515
You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting
so much. - Guys think I'm too smart.

24:43.515 --> 24:47.519
I don't. I think you're whacko.
Now you're seeing men behind bushes.

24:50.147 --> 24:52.524
Well, home sweet home.

24:53.024 --> 24:54.651
See you later.

24:55.152 --> 24:57.028
Bye.
- Bye.

25:11.751 --> 25:16.047
Excuse me, Laurie. - Oh, Mr. Brackett,
I'm sorry, Mr. Brackett. - Oh, I didn't mean to scary ya.

25:16.047 --> 25:17.215
I'm sorry.

25:17.716 --> 25:21.428
You know, it's Halloween.
I guess everybody's entitled to a one good scare.

25:21.845 --> 25:22.846
Yes, sir.

25:22.846 --> 25:24.347
Nice evening, sir.

26:02.928 --> 26:05.555
Trick -o - treat, Trick -o - treat.

26:09.226 --> 26:10.852
Oh, kiddo ...

26:10.852 --> 26:13.146
thought you grew up from superstition.

27:01.820 --> 27:02.737
Hello?

27:06.616 --> 27:07.534
Hello?

27:10.454 --> 27:11.955
Who is this?

27:22.048 --> 27:22.924
Hello?

27:22.924 --> 27:24.426
Why did you hang up on me?

27:24.426 --> 27:25.218
Annie?

27:25.218 --> 27:26.553
Was that you?

27:26.553 --> 27:29.639
Of course.
- Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.

27:29.639 --> 27:31.641
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?

27:31.641 --> 27:33.518
I thought it was an obscene phone call.

27:33.518 --> 27:38.356
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
- I've already lost it.

27:38.356 --> 27:39.232
I Doubt that.

27:39.232 --> 27:42.652
Listen, my mother is letting me use her car.
I'll pick you up. 6:30.

27:42.652 --> 27:45.030
Ok, bye.
-Bye.

27:57.250 --> 27:59.127
Just calm down.

28:00.420 --> 28:02.130
This is ridiculous.

29:18.248 --> 29:19.458
Hurry up.

29:29.217 --> 29:30.635
Just have time.

29:44.024 --> 29:46.318
Judith Myers. Myers.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.738
Row 18 ... plot 20.

29:51.239 --> 29:54.534
Hey, you know. You know,
every town has something like this happen.

29:55.535 --> 29:57.120
I remember over in Russellville.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.540
Old Charly Bowles. About fifteen years ago.

30:01.041 --> 30:03.418
One night he, he finished dinner ...

30:03.752 --> 30:06.546
And he excused himself from the table ...

30:07.047 --> 30:09.424
And he went out to the garage ...

30:09.925 --> 30:12.219
He got himself a hack saw ...

30:13.136 --> 30:15.222
And then he went back into the house ...

30:15.222 --> 30:18.141
And he kissed his wife and two children goodbye ...

30:18.350 --> 30:21.019
And then he proceeded ...
- Where are we?

30:22.521 --> 30:24.231
It's right over here.

30:25.023 --> 30:28.026
Myers, Judith Myers. I remember her.

30:28.026 --> 30:29.319
Couldn't believe.

30:29.319 --> 30:31.029
Such a young boy.

30:32.155 --> 30:33.532
Well, you lost?

30:34.533 --> 30:36.243
Why do they do it?

30:36.243 --> 30:38.036
Goddamn kids.

30:39.955 --> 30:41.957
They'll do anything for Halloweens.

30:42.916 --> 30:46.044
It was grave, hers.
- Oh, I know that.

30:46.753 --> 30:48.421
18, 19 ...

30:51.424 --> 30:52.717
Judith Myers.

30:55.846 --> 30:57.639
He came home.

31:02.519 --> 31:04.020
You still spooked?

31:04.020 --> 31:05.647
I wasn't spooked.

31:06.523 --> 31:08.525
Lies.
- I wasn't.

31:08.525 --> 31:12.237
Saw somebody standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
- Probably Mr. Riddle.

31:12.237 --> 31:16.950
He was watching me.
- Mr. Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mr. Riddle is 87.

31:16.950 --> 31:18.243
He can still watch.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.120
That's probably all he can do.

31:21.121 --> 31:26.626
What's the pumkin for? - I brought it for Tommy. I figured
carving a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.

31:26.626 --> 31:29.546
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
-

31:29.546 --> 31:33.216
Thanks. - And for that matter,
I might as well be a girl scout myself tonight.

31:33.216 --> 31:36.720
I plan on making popcorn
and watching Doctor Demensia.

31:36.720 --> 31:41.641
Six straight hours of horror movies.
Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.

31:51.318 --> 31:52.527
My dad!

31:52.527 --> 31:53.820
Get rid of this.

32:02.537 --> 32:05.540
Laurie, stop caughing. What's the matter with you?

32:06.541 --> 32:10.128
Just be natural. There he is. Just be natural, Laurie.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.218
Hi, Annie, Laurie...

32:16.927 --> 32:18.136
Hi, Dad.

32:18.136 --> 32:21.640
What happened?
- What? What happened?

32:21.640 --> 32:24.851
Somebody broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.

32:24.851 --> 32:27.020
You blame everything on kids.

32:27.020 --> 32:32.651
What all they took was some Halloween masks, a rope
and a couple of knives. Who do you think it was?

32:32.651 --> 32:35.028
It's hard growing up with a cynical father.

32:36.238 --> 32:38.031
Aren't you gonna be late ...
- Huh?

32:38.031 --> 32:42.035
I said aren't you gonna be late.
- He shouts too.

32:45.956 --> 32:47.040
Bye girls.

32:47.249 --> 32:48.917
Bye dad.
- Bye.

32:57.217 --> 32:58.218
Sheriff.

32:59.427 --> 33:02.347
Pardon me, I'm a Loomis. Dr. Sam Loomis.

33:02.347 --> 33:05.016
Lee Brackett.
- I, I'd like to have a word with you if I could.

33:05.016 --> 33:08.228
Ah, maybe a few minutes. I gotta take that
- It's just important.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.730
Ten minutes.
- I'll be here.

33:26.621 --> 33:28.623
What's the matter with you?

33:28.623 --> 33:30.625
I think he knew. I'm sure he could smell it.

33:30.625 --> 33:32.919
No, he didn't.
- He did.

33:32.919 --> 33:34.546
See the look on his face?

33:34.921 --> 33:37.424
He always looks like that.

33:40.218 --> 33:42.137
What  you gonna wear on dance tommorow night?

33:42.137 --> 33:44.723
I didn't know you thought about things like that, Laurie.

33:51.730 --> 33:54.232
You know you could ask somebody.
- No, I couldn't.

33:54.232 --> 33:57.819
Sure you could.
All you have to do is go up to somebody and say ...

33:57.819 --> 33:59.738
You wanna go to the dance?

34:00.030 --> 34:02.032
You could do that, I couldn't.

34:03.033 --> 34:06.244
Or you could ask Dick Paxter.
He could go out with ya.

34:07.037 --> 34:08.746
I try to get out Ben Tramor.

34:09.956 --> 34:12.125
Ben Tramor?

34:12.751 --> 34:14.543
I knew it!

34:15.545 --> 34:19.049
See, you do think about things like that, huh, Laurie?

34:19.632 --> 34:22.052
Shut up.
- He is cute.

34:22.052 --> 34:24.054
Ben Tramor.

34:57.045 --> 34:57.921
Ok.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.548
Bye.

35:31.538 --> 35:42.257
Trick or treat, trick or treat:
give me something good to eat.

35:53.226 --> 35:57.230
Hi. - Hi Annie, come on in.
- How are you doing today? - Fine. How are you?

35:57.647 --> 36:01.318
What time are you in your bed?
- I'm being in bed by nine, ok.

36:01.318 --> 36:02.652
Have a good night, dear.
- Be a good girl.

36:02.652 --> 36:04.529
Bye bye.
- Here.

36:30.639 --> 36:34.226
Anybody lives here?
- No, not since 1963 when that happened.

36:34.226 --> 36:38.230
Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
- They may be right.

36:56.456 --> 36:58.041
Look.
- What?

36:58.250 --> 36:59.751
What is that?

37:00.043 --> 37:00.919
It's a dog.

37:08.135 --> 37:09.427
Still warm.

37:10.637 --> 37:12.139
He got hungry.

37:14.850 --> 37:16.226
Could have been a skunk.

37:16.226 --> 37:17.352
Could have.

37:18.728 --> 37:20.230
A man wouldn't do that ...

37:21.148 --> 37:22.649
This is not a man.

37:59.019 --> 38:00.520
It happened in here.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.523
She was sitting right here ...

38:11.531 --> 38:13.241
He could have seen her thru this window.

38:15.452 --> 38:17.037
Standing on the lawn ...

38:17.037 --> 38:18.538
He could have seen in side.

38:28.048 --> 38:29.549
You must think of me ...

38:29.549 --> 38:31.134
the very sinister doctor.

38:34.054 --> 38:35.555
I do have a permit.

38:37.641 --> 38:40.143
Seems to me you're just plain scared.

38:40.143 --> 38:41.019
Yes.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.521
Yeah, I'm a...

38:43.855 --> 38:48.318
I met him ... fifteen years ago.
I was told there was nothing left.

38:48.318 --> 38:55.951
No reason ... nowhere conscience, no understanding
in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death of ...

38:56.743 --> 38:59.454
good or evil, right or wrong.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.456
I met this ...

39:01.915 --> 39:04.751
six year-old child with his ...

39:04.751 --> 39:08.755
blank, pale, emotionless face, and ...

39:10.048 --> 39:11.925
the blackest eyes ...

39:12.551 --> 39:14.427
the Devil's eyes.

39:15.137 --> 39:17.848
I spent eight years trying to reach him ...

39:17.848 --> 39:21.351
and then another seven trying to keep him locked up,
because I realized that

39:21.351 --> 39:25.230
what was living behind that boy's eyes
was purely and simply...

39:25.522 --> 39:27.023
... evil.

39:27.524 --> 39:28.525
What do we do?

39:29.526 --> 39:31.653
He's been here once tonight ...

39:31.820 --> 39:33.530
I think he'll come back.

39:33.822 --> 39:35.657
I'm gonna wait for him.

39:35.657 --> 39:38.743
I still think I should notify the radio and television.
- No.

39:38.743 --> 39:44.416
If you do that, they'll see him on every street corner, they
look for him on every house. Just tell your men to keep their ...

39:44.416 --> 39:46.543
mouth shut and their eyes open.

39:49.129 --> 39:51.047
I'll check back in an hour.

40:02.350 --> 40:03.852
... oh now, cried Arthur.

40:03.852 --> 40:06.646
'Let no one pass this way without a fight!'

40:06.646 --> 40:08.231
'That's so,' said the knight

40:08.231 --> 40:10.525
in a bold and haughty manner.

40:10.525 --> 40:14.321
I don't like that story.
- I thought king Arthur was your favorite.

40:14.321 --> 40:15.822
Not anymore.

40:18.241 --> 40:19.743
Why do you keep them under there?

40:19.743 --> 40:21.745
Mom doesn't like me to have them.

40:22.454 --> 40:24.039
'Laser Man' ...

40:24.623 --> 40:27.542
'Neutron Man' ... I can understand why.

40:27.918 --> 40:29.544
'Tarantula Man' ...

40:29.920 --> 40:30.921
Laurie ...

40:30.921 --> 40:32.631
what's the Boogeyman?

40:39.137 --> 40:40.555
Doyle residence.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.225
It's me ...
- Hi Annie, what are you doing?

40:43.225 --> 40:45.018
Making popcorn ...

40:45.352 --> 40:46.853
Having fun ...

40:46.853 --> 40:49.648
Never mind, I'm sure you are.

40:49.648 --> 40:53.151
I have big, big news for you ...

40:56.238 --> 40:57.322
Hold on a minute.

40:58.949 --> 41:00.117
Hi Lester...

41:00.951 --> 41:03.620
I'm about to be ripped apart by the family dog.

41:09.251 --> 41:13.547
Lindsey ... get this dog out of the kitchen right now.

41:23.723 --> 41:27.644
I hate that dog ...
I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.

41:28.145 --> 41:30.355
So, what is this big, big news?

41:30.730 --> 41:35.527
What would you say if I told you that you were going
to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?

41:36.319 --> 41:38.155
I would probably say you've got the wrong number.

41:38.822 --> 41:40.449
Well ...

41:40.949 --> 41:47.456
I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited
when I told him how attracted you were to him.

41:47.456 --> 41:48.623
Oh, Annie ...

41:49.249 --> 41:51.543
Oh, you didn't. Please tell me you didn't.

41:51.918 --> 41:53.628
How could you do that?

41:53.628 --> 41:57.924
I mean how you just call him.
What do you mean it's easy?

41:58.633 --> 42:00.427
I can't believe this.

42:00.719 --> 42:02.345
I can't tell you anything.

42:09.519 --> 42:10.854
Please tell me you didn't.

42:11.146 --> 42:12.731
Oh, you didn't.

42:13.648 --> 42:17.152
Laurie ... - I'm so embarrassed, I couldn't even face him.
- Boogeyman is outside.

42:17.652 --> 42:20.030
Laurie ... out there.
- Hold on.

42:20.030 --> 42:22.115
Laurie, the boogeyman is outside. Look!

42:28.246 --> 42:29.748
Tommy, there is nobody outside.

42:30.624 --> 42:32.042
Go watch TV.

42:32.417 --> 42:33.752
It's just Tommy.

42:35.545 --> 42:36.755
Oh, please, Annie ...

42:37.422 --> 42:38.924
You could do that.

42:39.633 --> 42:44.554
Look it's simple. You like him, he likes you.
All you need is a little push.

42:45.722 --> 42:48.725
It won't hurt you to go out with him, for God's sake.

42:49.226 --> 42:50.227
Shit!

42:51.019 --> 42:54.356
No, no, I just made a mess on myself.
I gotta call you back.

42:54.356 --> 42:55.649
Oh, yuck!

42:55.649 --> 42:57.150
Lindsey ...

42:57.150 --> 42:59.236
I need a robe.

43:42.654 --> 43:43.738
Lindsey ...

43:43.738 --> 43:47.617
Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.

43:51.121 --> 43:52.956
Never mind ...

43:53.248 --> 43:55.041
I guess he found a hot date.

44:43.256 --> 44:46.051
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
- After the movie.

44:46.718 --> 44:50.055
What about the rest of my comic books?
- After the Jack-O-Lantern.

44:50.222 --> 44:52.015
What about the boogeyman?

44:52.349 --> 44:53.850
There is no such thing.

44:53.850 --> 44:56.144
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.

44:56.144 --> 44:58.021
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?

44:58.021 --> 44:58.855
No.

45:00.023 --> 45:03.735
Tommy, Halloween night ...
it's when people play tricks on each other.

45:03.735 --> 45:06.738
It's all make believe.
I think Richie was just trying to scare you.

45:06.738 --> 45:10.742
I saw the boogeyman. I saw him outside.

45:10.742 --> 45:12.536
There was nobody outside.

45:12.536 --> 45:14.621
There was.
- What did he look like?

45:15.747 --> 45:17.249
The boogyeman!

45:18.416 --> 45:20.043
We're not getting anywhere.

45:20.752 --> 45:21.628
All right.

45:21.628 --> 45:23.922
The boogyeman can only come out
on Halloween night, right?

45:23.922 --> 45:24.923
Right.

45:24.923 --> 45:28.218
Welll, I'm here tonight.
I'm not about to let anything happen to you.

45:29.052 --> 45:30.345
Promise?

45:30.345 --> 45:31.847
Promise.

45:31.847 --> 45:34.141
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?

45:35.517 --> 45:36.518
Let's go.

45:59.124 --> 46:00.750
Hmm, terrific.

46:18.226 --> 46:19.144
Hello?

46:21.146 --> 46:22.522
Who's there?

46:24.316 --> 46:27.652
Paul, is this one of your cheap pranks?

46:31.323 --> 46:32.532
Guess not.

46:34.034 --> 46:36.244
No tricks for Annie tonight.

46:54.054 --> 46:55.639
Lindsey!

46:56.556 --> 46:58.517
Lindsey, come out here!

46:58.517 --> 47:02.521
Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room! The door wouldn't open!

47:02.521 --> 47:03.230
Spread out everybody.

47:03.230 --> 47:05.649
We gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing.

47:07.025 --> 47:08.318
Holly cat.

47:08.318 --> 47:10.153
Hey.
- Yeah.

47:10.821 --> 47:14.449
Almost perfect.
What's wrong?

47:14.950 --> 47:17.953
We finally got one.
- We found a plain sourcer.

47:18.453 --> 47:21.123
Oh, Lindsey, get the phone, it's Paul.

47:21.957 --> 47:23.750
Lindsey!

47:24.543 --> 47:27.129
Lindseeey!

47:45.021 --> 47:47.816
No, no answer. - Doctor, where are those fingers from?

47:47.816 --> 47:49.651
I don't know, Mr. Scott.
Hallo?

47:49.651 --> 47:52.529
Hi Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?

47:52.529 --> 47:53.822
Yes, she is.

47:53.822 --> 47:55.240
Get her for me, will ya?

47:55.240 --> 47:57.242
She's washing her clothes.

47:57.242 --> 47:59.536
Look, just tell her it's me, ok?

47:59.744 --> 48:01.121
Ok.

48:06.126 --> 48:08.420
Annie, Paul called!

48:20.849 --> 48:24.019
You locked yourself there.
- I know.

48:26.021 --> 48:28.648
Pull my foot. I'm stuck!

48:47.250 --> 48:50.545
Now promise me you won't tell anybody about this.

49:09.231 --> 49:11.733
She got stuck in a window. She'll be right here.

49:14.736 --> 49:16.738
Hello?
Hi Annie.

49:16.738 --> 49:18.949
Oh, hi Paul.
Stuck, huh?

49:18.949 --> 49:23.537
All right, cut it out. It can happen to anyone.
Sure ... stuck in the widow.

49:23.537 --> 49:27.124
Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in plenty of other positions!

49:27.124 --> 49:28.542
My parents are gone.

49:28.542 --> 49:31.628
Oh that's fabulous. When did they leave?

49:31.628 --> 49:35.048
About half ago
- Oh, utterly fantastic.

49:36.049 --> 49:38.218
So why don't you just walk over?

49:38.218 --> 49:41.847
You coming pick me up.
- Well, I can't come now. My clothes are in the wash.

49:41.847 --> 49:47.644
Oh shut up jerk. Can't, I've got a shirt on.
That's all you ever think about.

49:47.644 --> 49:51.356
I think that's all you ever think about.
- That's not true, I think about lots of things.

49:51.356 --> 49:55.318
Now why don't we not stand here
talking about them and get down to doing them?

49:56.528 --> 50:03.452
Lock your doors, bolt your window and turn off the lights.

50:03.452 --> 50:07.247
Don't go away ... cause here is a scene ...
- I'm scared.

50:07.622 --> 50:09.749
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?

50:09.749 --> 50:12.919
I don't know.
- Well, come on get your coat.
We're going to pick up Paul.

50:12.919 --> 50:15.255
I don't want to.

50:15.255 --> 50:20.635
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
- I want to stay here and watch this.

50:20.635 --> 50:25.348
Okay, if I can fix it so you can watch TV
with Tommy Doyle, would you like that?

50:25.348 --> 50:28.226
Yes.
- Well, come with me.

50:33.648 --> 50:35.233
Come on! Hurry up.

51:01.134 --> 51:04.346
That strange that has to short it out.

51:04.846 --> 51:06.139
Hi Tommy.

51:06.139 --> 51:06.848
Hi.

51:06.848 --> 51:11.144
Come on in. We're making a Jack-O-Lantern.
- You know I wanna watch TV.

51:12.729 --> 51:14.356
Annie, come in here.

51:14.731 --> 51:18.652
...now the horrifying conclusion ...

51:18.652 --> 51:20.821
... to ... the them.

51:23.031 --> 51:24.533
Oh, fancy.

51:24.533 --> 51:26.952
This has not been my night.

51:28.537 --> 51:35.252
I spilled butter all over. My cloths are in the wash.
I got stuck in a window. - I'd like you call Ben Tramer
and tell him you're just fooling around.

51:35.252 --> 51:40.215
I can't. - Yes, you can. - No, he went drinking with
Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late.

51:40.215 --> 51:43.051
YOU'LL have to call him ... tomorrow.

51:43.051 --> 51:45.345
Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.

51:46.346 --> 51:47.347
Wait a minute.

51:47.347 --> 51:52.352
If you watch her,
I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.

51:52.727 --> 51:53.728
Deal.

51:55.230 --> 51:58.733
I thought Paul was grounded.
- He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out.

51:58.733 --> 52:02.654
Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so, ok?
- Yeah.

52:02.654 --> 52:04.239
Bye.

52:08.034 --> 52:10.620
The old girl scout comes through again.

52:23.550 --> 52:27.554
# My Paul ... I give you all #

52:29.848 --> 52:36.229
# No keys, but pleeease ... #
#my Paul #

53:06.051 --> 53:11.556
# Oh, Paul ... #
#I can no longer stall... #

53:11.556 --> 53:19.648
# Oh Paul. Oh Paul ...#
#I can no longer stall... #

53:19.648 --> 53:22.818
# Dearly Paul ... #

53:24.027 --> 53:26.029
# my Paul #

54:22.127 --> 54:22.752
Attention ...

54:22.752 --> 54:25.255
Captain and crew standby reverse polarity.

54:25.255 --> 54:29.050
Standard class A security will be maintained upon landing.

54:29.217 --> 54:32.220
And until further notice all land in and hold on.

54:32.220 --> 54:33.346
That is all.

54:33.638 --> 54:34.848
Artificial gravity are ...

54:34.848 --> 54:36.725
ad lock cut primary coarse.

54:36.725 --> 54:38.226
Primary stature.

55:02.417 --> 55:04.628
Lindsey ...

55:04.628 --> 55:06.254
Lindseyyy ....

55:06.755 --> 55:08.256
Where are you?

55:33.615 --> 55:40.038
There is the boogeyman! He is outside!
Look, there is the boogeyman outside! - What's wrong?

55:40.038 --> 55:43.917
I saw the boogeyman! I know that - Oh, Tommy stop it!
- But at Lindsey's! - You're scaring Lindsey.

55:43.917 --> 55:47.629
He's over there!
- Tommy, stop it! There is nobody out there!

55:48.046 --> 55:52.634
There's no boogeyman. And if you don't stop all this
I'll have to turn off the TV and send you to bed.

55:56.555 --> 56:01.143
Nobody believes me.
- I believe you, Tommy.

56:33.133 --> 56:34.134
I'm not afraid.

56:34.134 --> 56:35.427
Bull.

56:35.427 --> 56:37.220
I'm not.
- Then go in.

56:45.020 --> 56:46.146
Chicken.

56:46.146 --> 56:47.647
Go ahead, Lonnie.

56:48.732 --> 56:50.150
Go in!

56:53.320 --> 56:54.154
Hey!

56:54.821 --> 56:56.323
Hey, Lonnie ...

56:56.323 --> 56:58.950
Get your ass away from there ...

57:11.254 --> 57:12.547
Jesus.

57:12.547 --> 57:14.049
Are you all right here?

57:14.216 --> 57:15.550
Yeah.

57:15.550 --> 57:21.223
Well, nothing's going on except kids playing pranks,
trick or treating, partying, getting high.

57:21.223 --> 57:23.517
I have the feeling you're way off on this.

57:23.517 --> 57:26.728
You have the wrong feeling.
- You're not doing very much to prove me wrong.

57:26.728 --> 57:28.522
What more do you need?

57:28.522 --> 57:32.526
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk
to keep me up all night crawling around these bushes.

57:32.526 --> 57:35.028
I, I, I watched him for fifteen years ...

57:35.028 --> 57:39.032
sitting in a room, staring at a wall, not seeing the wall ...

57:39.032 --> 57:40.534
looking past the wall

57:40.534 --> 57:43.954
looking at ... THIS NIGHT inhumanly patient.

57:45.747 --> 57:48.917
waiting for some secret, silent alarm ...

57:48.917 --> 57:50.544
to trigger him off.

57:51.253 --> 57:54.923
Death has come to your little town, sheriff.

57:54.923 --> 57:58.135
You can either ignore it or you can help me to stop it.

57:58.635 --> 58:00.220
More fancy talk.

58:00.637 --> 58:02.556
Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is?

58:02.556 --> 58:03.640
Families ...

58:03.640 --> 58:06.852
Children ... all lined up in rows,
up and down these streets.

58:06.852 --> 58:09.229
You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.

58:09.229 --> 58:10.856
They could be.

58:12.149 --> 58:14.234
All right, I'll stay with you out tonight ...

58:14.234 --> 58:15.527
just on the chance that you're right.

58:16.653 --> 58:18.155
And if you are right ...

58:18.655 --> 58:21.032
damn you for letting him go.

58:42.721 --> 58:45.724
So we gonna first, we'll go inside, right?
Then we just talk a little.

58:45.724 --> 58:50.729
Then Annie will distract Lindsey, that's when we'll
go upstairs to the first bedroom on the left. You got it?

58:50.729 --> 58:53.023
First I rip your clothes off ...

58:53.023 --> 58:56.735
Don't rip, my blouse is expensive, idiot.
- Then you rip my clothes off...

58:56.735 --> 58:59.654
then we rip Lyndsey's cloth off. Yeah, I think I got it.

58:59.654 --> 59:00.655
Totally.

59:20.550 --> 59:23.220
Bob ... put me down.

59:23.220 --> 59:26.139
Put me down. This is totally silly.

59:26.139 --> 59:27.349
Put me down.

59:30.519 --> 59:32.729
Hey, it's totally dark.
- Yeah.

59:33.647 --> 59:34.856
Annie!

59:35.232 --> 59:38.151
Annie, we're here!
- I wonder where they went.

59:39.027 --> 59:41.738
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something.

59:50.122 --> 59:51.623
Hey, let's look for a note.

59:51.957 --> 59:53.125
Let's not.

01:00:27.617 --> 01:00:29.244
He's gonna get you ...

01:00:29.244 --> 01:00:33.248
No, he's not. - Hey, nobody's getting anybody.
Stop scaring each other.

01:00:49.347 --> 01:00:51.850
Everybody's having good time tonight.

01:00:52.517 --> 01:00:54.352
All right, guys, what's next?

01:00:54.352 --> 01:00:58.356
Let's make more popcorn. - No, we had enough.
Why don't we watch the rest of the movie?

01:00:58.523 --> 01:00:59.524
Yeah.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.738
All right, put it back on.

01:01:17.042 --> 01:01:18.418
Doyle house.

01:01:18.418 --> 01:01:20.545
Hi Laurie ... what's up?

01:01:20.545 --> 01:01:22.756
I'm just setting down for the first time tonight.

01:01:23.632 --> 01:01:25.217
Hey ... is Annie around?

01:01:25.634 --> 01:01:26.927
No, I thought she'd be home by now.

01:01:26.927 --> 01:01:30.347
She went to pick up Paul.
- Well, she's totally not here.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.017
She's probably stopped off some place.

01:01:34.017 --> 01:01:38.021
Have her call me when she gets home.
I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know
what time to put her to bed.

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:41.650
Okay. Later.
- Have a good time.

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:43.735
We definetely will.

01:01:44.653 --> 01:01:45.821
Bye.

01:01:47.739 --> 01:01:52.744
Lindsey is gone for the night.
- Hey, now that's wonderful.

01:02:35.954 --> 01:02:38.039
Oh, shit! Not again.

01:02:38.039 --> 01:02:40.041
I can't help it. The phone keeps ringing.

01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:43.545
Oh, I can't keep you interested, huh?
- Just answer that damn phone.

01:02:44.045 --> 01:02:46.548
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces?

01:02:46.548 --> 01:02:48.216
We'd get Annie in trouble now.

01:02:52.637 --> 01:02:54.222
Just take it off the hook.

01:03:28.924 --> 01:03:30.926
Fantastic.

01:03:33.345 --> 01:03:36.139
Totally.
- Yeah.

01:03:47.526 --> 01:03:49.236
Is that all you can say?

01:03:49.236 --> 01:03:50.028
Yeah.

01:03:53.031 --> 01:03:56.034
Go get me a beer.
- I thought you were gonna get me one.

01:03:56.034 --> 01:03:57.119
Yeaah.

01:03:59.621 --> 01:04:01.248
I'll be right back.

01:04:01.248 --> 01:04:03.416
Don't get dressed.

01:04:59.222 --> 01:05:00.223
Annie?

01:05:01.516 --> 01:05:02.517
Paul?

01:05:06.354 --> 01:05:08.648
Lynda, you asshole!

01:05:12.819 --> 01:05:14.237
Ok, Lynda.

01:05:14.237 --> 01:05:15.322
Come on out.

01:06:18.552 --> 01:06:19.845
Well, did you get my beer?

01:06:27.018 --> 01:06:29.229
Cute, Bob. Real cute.

01:06:41.616 --> 01:06:43.118
See anything you like?

01:06:51.126 --> 01:06:53.545
What's the matter? Can I get your ghost, Bob?

01:07:02.053 --> 01:07:04.055
All right, all right. Come on, where is my beer?

01:07:10.353 --> 01:07:12.022
Ok, ain't answer me?

01:07:16.234 --> 01:07:17.736
Ok, don't answer me?

01:07:19.154 --> 01:07:22.449
Oh, you're weird!
- I'm gonna call Laurie.

01:07:22.449 --> 01:07:25.035
Well, I'm gonna call Laurie.
I wanna know where Annie and Paul are.

01:07:25.035 --> 01:07:26.536
This is going nowhere.

01:07:30.749 --> 01:07:32.125
Finally.

01:07:38.131 --> 01:07:39.132
Hello.

01:07:42.427 --> 01:07:43.345
Hello?

01:07:46.223 --> 01:07:50.644
All right, Annie. First I get your famous chewing,
now I get your famous squealing?

01:07:54.856 --> 01:07:56.316
Annie, you all right?

01:08:06.451 --> 01:08:08.245
Are you fooling around again?

01:08:09.746 --> 01:08:11.540
I'll kill you if this is a joke.

01:08:12.457 --> 01:08:13.416
Annie?

01:08:16.419 --> 01:08:17.420
Annie?

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.555
Sleep tight, kids.

01:12:19.538 --> 01:12:20.747
Paul?

01:12:21.748 --> 01:12:23.041
Lynda?

01:12:31.133 --> 01:12:32.217
Lynda?

01:12:43.728 --> 01:12:44.855
Annie?

01:13:02.956 --> 01:13:03.748
Annie?

01:13:07.127 --> 01:13:08.253
Lynda?

01:13:10.922 --> 01:13:11.923
Bob?

01:13:27.647 --> 01:13:29.024
All right, Annie ...

01:13:54.257 --> 01:13:56.426
All right, meatheads. The joke's over.

01:14:01.056 --> 01:14:02.057
Come on, Annie.

01:14:02.057 --> 01:14:03.141
It's enough.

01:14:07.145 --> 01:14:10.023
This is most definitely stopping funny.
Now cut it out!

01:14:13.318 --> 01:14:14.736
You'll be sorry.

01:17:26.636 --> 01:17:27.637
No.

01:17:53.747 --> 01:17:55.040
Help!

01:17:55.457 --> 01:17:57.918
Somebody help me, please!

01:17:57.918 --> 01:18:00.045
Somebody help!

01:18:00.045 --> 01:18:02.130
Oh, God, help me!

01:18:02.756 --> 01:18:03.924
Please!

01:18:04.549 --> 01:18:05.926
Please, help me!

01:18:08.136 --> 01:18:09.638
Heeeelp!

01:18:10.347 --> 01:18:12.349
Oh, God, help me, please!

01:18:12.641 --> 01:18:13.725
Hello!

01:18:14.226 --> 01:18:15.352
Helloo!

01:18:15.644 --> 01:18:16.645
Hello?

01:18:17.729 --> 01:18:19.356
Helloo, help me!

01:18:19.356 --> 01:18:21.233
Will you please help me?

01:18:21.233 --> 01:18:22.526
Please!

01:18:23.235 --> 01:18:24.820
Can't you hear me?!

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.530
Oh,God ...

01:18:29.616 --> 01:18:31.952
Help me, please!

01:18:43.547 --> 01:18:44.923
The keys!

01:18:44.923 --> 01:18:46.925
Oh, the keys!

01:18:51.847 --> 01:18:53.140
Tommyy!

01:18:54.224 --> 01:18:56.143
Tommy, it's mee!

01:18:58.145 --> 01:18:59.521
Tommyy!

01:19:08.321 --> 01:19:11.450
Who is it?
- Tommy, open up, it's mee!

01:19:12.617 --> 01:19:14.619
Tommy please!

01:19:15.245 --> 01:19:17.038
Tommy, hurry up!

01:19:17.038 --> 01:19:19.124
Tommy please!

01:19:22.544 --> 01:19:25.422
Hurry up! Tommy please!

01:19:25.422 --> 01:19:28.133
Tommy, go upstairs. - What is it, Laurie?
- Tommy go back upstairs,
grab the Lindsey and lock the door.

01:19:28.133 --> 01:19:31.553
I'm scared!- Do what I say! Now!
- It's the boogeyman, isn't it? - Hurry!

01:19:43.732 --> 01:19:45.233
Oh, no ...

01:20:00.415 --> 01:20:01.917
Please, stop.

01:20:01.917 --> 01:20:03.418
Please ...

01:21:18.535 --> 01:21:22.247
Where were you? I went to the Meyers house.
- I found the car. He is here!

01:21:22.247 --> 01:21:26.543
Where? - He's three blocks down.
You go around back off the houses, I'll watch the front.

01:21:26.752 --> 01:21:27.627
Go on!

01:21:58.116 --> 01:22:00.035
Tommy ... Lyndsey ...

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.622
Babies ...

01:22:07.417 --> 01:22:09.252
We're gonna take a little walk.

01:22:09.252 --> 01:22:10.545
Was it the boogeyman?

01:22:11.254 --> 01:22:13.423
-I'm scared.
-There's nothing to be scared of.

01:22:13.423 --> 01:22:14.925
Are you sure?

01:22:16.218 --> 01:22:17.427
How?

01:22:17.719 --> 01:22:19.137
I killed him.

01:22:19.846 --> 01:22:21.848
You can't kill the boogeyman.

01:22:25.644 --> 01:22:28.230
Get in there! Come on, Tommy! Now, lock the door!

01:25:06.346 --> 01:25:07.722
Tommy ...

01:25:07.722 --> 01:25:09.057
Unlock the door.

01:25:12.519 --> 01:25:13.645
Come here.

01:25:14.521 --> 01:25:15.522
Now just listen to me ...

01:25:16.648 --> 01:25:18.150
I want you to go down the stairs ...

01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:19.734
and out the front door.

01:25:19.734 --> 01:25:22.154
And I want you to go down the street
to the Mackenzies' house ...

01:25:22.529 --> 01:25:24.739
I want you to tell them to call the police.

01:25:24.739 --> 01:25:26.741
And tell them to send them over here.

01:25:26.741 --> 01:25:28.618
Laurie ...
- Now, do you understand me?

01:25:28.618 --> 01:25:30.245
Yes. - Go. Do as I say.

01:25:51.850 --> 01:25:52.851
Get help!

01:25:52.851 --> 01:25:54.019
Come on!

01:25:54.352 --> 01:25:55.645
Come on!

01:27:19.855 --> 01:27:21.648
Was that the boogeyman?

01:27:27.028 --> 01:27:28.655
As a matter of fact ...

01:27:28.655 --> 01:27:29.739
it was.

01:27:30.305 --> 01:27:36.359
