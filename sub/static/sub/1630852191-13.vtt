WEBVTT

01:12.530 --> 01:14.157
<i>Standing way up there…</i>

01:15.116 --> 01:17.494
<i>who would you think of?</i>

01:20.830 --> 01:23.041
Jeong…

04:19.676 --> 04:21.135
Gosh, it's cold.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.255
There.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.985
Okay.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.395
I'll call you.
Can you stay somewhere else for a while?

06:36.479 --> 06:37.563
Please?

06:40.983 --> 06:42.485
Why must I do that?

06:43.319 --> 06:45.029
He's at the airport right now.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.198
He's coming to see the baby.
What could I do?

06:50.451 --> 06:51.702
Come on, now.

06:51.786 --> 06:55.081
Why? Why must I leave my son here
and go somewhere else?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.959
He's my son, not yours.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.294
No. He's my son.

07:00.878 --> 07:01.921
I raised him.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.132
Ho-su is my son.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.341
Woo-jae.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.262
Please, Woo-jae.

07:55.683 --> 07:56.517
Hui-ju.

08:59.705 --> 09:00.873
Jeong Hui-ju!

09:05.044 --> 09:06.045
Hui-ju!

10:10.484 --> 10:15.323
EPISODE 13
SOME TIMES DO NOT DISAPPEAR

10:16.782 --> 10:20.036
TAERIM HOSPITAL

10:50.024 --> 10:53.444
I'm not the lost cause here. It's--

10:54.904 --> 10:57.239
Was pestering me not enough?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.909
Why do you want her to leave?
Scared of what I'll say?

11:31.774 --> 11:35.319
<i> This is the document Mr. Lee got
from Sligo General Hospital.</i>

11:52.253 --> 11:53.295
<i>Explain this to me.</i>

11:58.342 --> 12:02.847
Explain why this man
is the guardian on this birth certificate.

12:13.232 --> 12:17.153
All the students from Korea were
quite close since we were far from home.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.990
Naturally, we helped
each other out when needed.

12:27.121 --> 12:31.208
My contractions began
earlier than my due date.

12:32.543 --> 12:36.005
And I'm sure you remember
how busy Hyeon-seong was

12:36.088 --> 12:38.549
with setting up
the foundation for Taerim Academy.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.010
I couldn't drive myself.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.847
So Mr. Seo drove me to the hospital.

12:49.894 --> 12:54.023
He must have signed it
because the hospital staff asked him.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.694
And that's it.

12:59.653 --> 13:02.156
I understand this looks suspicious to you,

13:02.239 --> 13:03.949
but you have the wrong idea.

13:08.913 --> 13:12.625
Did you practice this?
That was very smooth.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.713
Yes, he's your son
because you gave birth to him.

13:18.589 --> 13:21.133
But how could I believe you
after seeing this?

13:29.683 --> 13:31.143
Does Hyeon-seong know

13:32.061 --> 13:33.646
what you're doing right now?

13:33.729 --> 13:35.606
I will tell him once I get the results.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.359
Why didn't you just call him here today?

13:40.277 --> 13:43.614
It's been 20 years
since we've been married.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.575
It's our marriage, so we'll handle it.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.494
This isn't your place to intervene.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.620
You…

13:54.833 --> 13:58.420
I couldn't care less about your marriage.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.715
I'm checking all the boxes to make sure

14:01.799 --> 14:05.177
my grandchild is indeed mine
before he inherits my assets.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.683
We'll know for sure tomorrow
if I'm wasting my time or not.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.194
"There was a girl."

14:25.573 --> 14:29.702
"Her mind was full of questions
about the world,

14:32.246 --> 14:34.623
full of thoughts
about the stars in the night sky,

14:38.377 --> 14:41.088
and full of amazement about the ocean."

14:43.382 --> 14:47.219
"Whenever she found something new,
she was elated."

14:49.805 --> 14:51.181
"But that was only until…

14:53.058 --> 14:56.020
she saw the empty chair
her grandpa used to sit in."

14:59.607 --> 15:02.067
What? Are you crying?

15:03.861 --> 15:05.112
Why?

15:05.195 --> 15:07.531
Well, it's sad.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.575
Which part?

15:11.702 --> 15:13.495
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.997
I'll know if you tell me.

15:16.790 --> 15:20.377
Sadness is something you feel.
It can't be understood through words.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.383
Then I think I feel it too.

15:27.259 --> 15:31.472
-What?
-Because I don't feel good either.

15:36.518 --> 15:37.728
I'm sorry, Ho-su.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.105
I'm really sorry.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.607
It's okay.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.861
Ma'am, you don't have to
apologize for being sad.

15:53.869 --> 15:58.624
"The scared girl decided to put her heart
in a bottle just for a little while."

15:59.875 --> 16:02.836
Why did she put her heart in a bottle?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.088
Well…

16:05.005 --> 16:08.467
Maybe keeping her heart
was too painful for her.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.219
Why was it painful?

16:11.553 --> 16:14.014
It happens when you lose
something precious to you.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.725
What does "precious" mean?

16:16.809 --> 16:19.144
Something is precious
when there's only one of that.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.230
The only one in the world.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.406
But you have to be careful.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.741
If you put your heart
in the bottle for too long,

16:32.825 --> 16:34.618
you'll forget other feelings too.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.144
Ho-su…

17:01.687 --> 17:02.563
Ho-su…

17:11.071 --> 17:12.531
I told you to stay away.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.617
I'm not here to see Hui-ju.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.664
And I made myself very clear as well.
I never forgave her.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.208
-Ms. Gu.
-You said you love her.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.795
You couldn't have forgiven her that easily
if you truly loved her.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.177
Or it's, "Since I forgave you,

17:33.844 --> 17:35.804
I'm a better person than you."

17:36.930 --> 17:38.640
"I'm the most ethical man."

17:39.850 --> 17:41.727
Is that your way of comforting yourself?

17:45.397 --> 17:48.400
Seeing you try
to keep your dignity to the end

17:48.984 --> 17:51.195
makes you look pathetic, not respectable.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.616
It's natural to break down
and get jealous when you've been betrayed.

17:55.699 --> 17:58.285
But you don't want
to show people that you are weak?

18:01.413 --> 18:03.373
How about you?
You think you're doing well?

18:12.299 --> 18:15.803
You say you're getting revenge,
but you seem more distressed.

18:15.886 --> 18:19.264
No matter how distressed I am,
it is easier than being forgiving.

18:19.348 --> 18:23.143
You two can try whatever you want,
but I'm not going to leave my wife.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.062
And my wife feels the same too.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.981
So let me tell you this one last time.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.653
You should stop here.
I mean this. I really do.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.282
I don't want to hurt you.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.337
Ho-su.

18:56.426 --> 18:57.719
I hope you don't blame me.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.515
I'm not as experienced as you.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.685
So I can't say no to our mother-in-law.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.863
Mom, I can't breathe.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.699
Right. I'm sorry.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.872
You know how much I love you, right?

19:26.415 --> 19:30.460
You know how precious
you are to me. Right?

19:31.253 --> 19:32.629
Yes, I know.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.507
Because you only have one Ho-su.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.135
The one and only in the world.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.727
What are you doing here, honey?

19:53.942 --> 19:57.154
It's all right, Hui-ju.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.166
Go home with Ho-su.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.460
Don't worry.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.128
Why? What are you going to do?

20:13.712 --> 20:16.173
Whatever it is,
there's nothing to gain from avoiding it.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.134
Don't go. Your mother--

20:19.218 --> 20:22.888
What is it? Are there more things
we should be worried about?

20:27.517 --> 20:28.685
No.

20:28.769 --> 20:32.189
Then trust me.
I'm your husband and Ho-su's father.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.298
How did you find out?

20:58.799 --> 21:00.300
Did she call you already?

21:01.843 --> 21:02.886
What's this?

21:06.890 --> 21:08.475
What do you think you're doing?

21:08.558 --> 21:10.102
Ho-su is my son.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.940
I'm sure you want to believe that,
so let's check to make sure.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.111
We don't need this test.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.241
Did you already get the test done?

21:26.410 --> 21:29.121
Do you think
I let you marry her for your sake?

21:30.080 --> 21:33.750
When you told me
she was pregnant and the only one for you,

21:33.834 --> 21:35.294
I had already given up on you.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.963
I let you two get married

21:38.046 --> 21:41.383
so that I could raise an heir
to take your place since you were useless.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.927
I put up with you
because I needed a grandson!

21:44.011 --> 21:45.012
Mom, please!

21:45.095 --> 21:47.347
You must've gotten the test for a reason.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.063
Your reactions prove my suspicion right.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.816
I can tell you're hiding something nasty.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.944
I don't care what the results say.
Divorce her!

22:05.073 --> 22:06.700
I'm turning 50 soon.

22:09.119 --> 22:11.580
I don't think I can start over at my age.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.915
If she leaves, I leave too.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.251
-Hey!
-You did the same thing!

22:17.586 --> 22:19.338
Even until his very last breath,

22:21.173 --> 22:23.675
-you didn't let go of Father.
-I hated what he did.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.262
I helped him build everything he had.

22:27.929 --> 22:31.433
That self-pitying man prided himself
on his smarts and was never grateful.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.686
Lowlifes always act like that.

22:35.270 --> 22:37.689
They delude themselves
into thinking they earned it.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.525
You think she's any different?

22:41.818 --> 22:43.737
She's different. I know her.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.614
Don't be so sure.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.741
I thought I knew your father too.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.204
But I was wrong.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.666
I lived with him for 30 years,
but I still didn't know who he was.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.251
I knew nothing about him!

22:59.920 --> 23:03.548
Because of him,
he tarnished my entire life!

23:04.466 --> 23:08.845
Your father made me feel insignificant!

23:14.601 --> 23:15.644
Are you sure…

23:18.188 --> 23:20.023
you won't end up like me?

23:53.765 --> 23:58.937
<i>"The scared girl decided to put her heart
in a bottle just for a little while…</i>

24:00.230 --> 24:01.898
<i>because her heart might get hurt."</i>

24:03.608 --> 24:05.819
<i>"When she did, her heart stopped hurting."</i>

24:07.195 --> 24:10.323
<i>"But her thoughts about the stars</i>

24:10.407 --> 24:13.326
<i>and her interest
in the ocean disappeared."</i>

24:14.536 --> 24:15.871
<i>"Soon enough,</i>

24:16.580 --> 24:19.624
<i>the girl lost her love and curiosity</i>

24:20.584 --> 24:21.960
<i>for the world."</i>

25:13.887 --> 25:17.224
<i>Then trust me.
I'm your husband and Ho-su's father.</i>

25:28.652 --> 25:33.031
<i>Be careful of the overhead bins
as the contents may fall out.</i>

26:05.814 --> 26:08.942
<i>I don't think there's any need
to try to remember what's already past.</i>

26:09.901 --> 26:12.487
If you don't remember it,
then it's never happened.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.548
Mr. Lee.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.429
I'll stay here and talk.

26:40.223 --> 26:43.393
A line is there for a reason.
Don't cross the line.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.063
I don't follow.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.607
Don't think
I haven't said anything about you

26:51.026 --> 26:52.944
and my sister because I don't know.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.033
She and I might not be that close,

26:58.908 --> 27:02.162
but she'll choose me over you
because if your marriage goes south,

27:02.245 --> 27:04.289
you will practically be a stranger to her.

27:05.290 --> 27:08.501
If you're upset about
what happened to Hui-ju, your mother--

27:08.585 --> 27:10.295
I know. I do.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.592
But that's my business.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.887
So stop meddling in my affairs.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.599
You can go.

27:40.241 --> 27:43.286
Instead of arranging the pieces
at eye level like before,

27:43.370 --> 27:47.374
what do you think about
placing it slightly lower?

27:47.457 --> 27:50.251
I see. That's an original approach.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.754
It's worth trying it out.

27:52.837 --> 27:57.550
And I want ample space between the pieces

27:57.634 --> 28:02.055
for the visitors to have more time
to appreciate the pieces.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.516
To get a better understanding…

28:14.150 --> 28:15.402
Do you have the results?

28:16.403 --> 28:19.072
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY: 99,999%
AN HYEON-SEONG, FATHER

28:19.155 --> 28:20.907
AN HO-SU, SON

28:26.454 --> 28:28.873
Don't think this makes everything go away.

28:29.624 --> 28:31.376
I saw how you reacted yesterday.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.255
There must be some history
between you and him.

28:37.298 --> 28:38.800
How could anyone

28:38.883 --> 28:41.719
not get flustered
after being accused like that?

28:42.637 --> 28:46.975
It seemed Hyeon-seong had already known,
but he just wouldn't talk about it.

28:52.105 --> 28:56.443
I wonder what on earth you did
to have him wrapped around your finger.

28:58.695 --> 29:01.656
I won't let this go
just because you two seem okay with it.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.117
Now get out.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.999
DNA PATERNITY TEST RESULTS

29:37.233 --> 29:40.445
I didn't have time for lunch.
So I'm having this instead.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.324
You and Jeong-hwan
will stay here this summer.

29:44.407 --> 29:46.701
Summer is a critical time for Jeong-hwan.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.204
A three-week summer program
will increase his options.

29:49.287 --> 29:52.499
It's just college.
Like your mother said, it's not important.

29:53.082 --> 29:56.336
He takes after you and me.
There's no doubt that he's a smart kid.

29:56.836 --> 29:59.255
Studying is not
what Jeong-hwan needs right now.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.008
It's your mother's attention.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.929
But still, he has an interest
he wants to pursue. Why don't we--

30:06.012 --> 30:07.972
Why study how dolphins communicate?

30:08.056 --> 30:10.183
How will that help him
inherit the foundation?

30:12.268 --> 30:16.272
You know that my mother loves sons.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.236
She has Hyeon-seong.
She wouldn't consider me.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.697
I'll never see eye to eye with her.

30:29.118 --> 30:32.247
The higher hopes she has for him,
the more betrayed she'll feel.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.916
This is the time to win her over.

30:35.625 --> 30:38.169
We may have to do
whatever she tells us to do,

30:38.253 --> 30:41.631
but shouldn't we, as his parents,
help our son hold the reins?

30:45.343 --> 30:47.262
Have Jeong-hwan
attend med school in Korea.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.348
He has a chance to be a doctor

30:50.431 --> 30:53.726
and the head of a hospital
just like you wanted.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.897
How much longer
will you lose out to your brother?

30:58.439 --> 31:00.900
Who do you think is running this hospital?

31:07.448 --> 31:09.868
Mr. Seo moved up
his return flight to Korea.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.703
He'll be arriving today.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.539
Right before leaving Ireland,

31:15.039 --> 31:17.292
he stopped by Sligo General Hospital.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.010
There's your mom.

31:27.093 --> 31:29.137
-Mom!
-Ho-su.

31:29.637 --> 31:30.930
This is for you, Mom.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.603
This is for me? I wonder what it is.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.147
Is this a vase?

31:39.230 --> 31:42.734
You can put your heart
in the bottle when it hurts, okay?

31:45.445 --> 31:47.739
How did you come up
with such a sweet thought?

31:48.239 --> 31:49.407
That lady read me a book.

31:51.534 --> 31:52.785
"Lady"?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.204
I see. The doctor?

31:55.288 --> 31:58.541
No. The lady who brought me
home on my birthday.

32:04.422 --> 32:08.635
When did she read this book to you?

32:08.718 --> 32:10.553
Yesterday, when I was waiting for you.

32:13.848 --> 32:14.974
Was that lady…

32:17.477 --> 32:19.687
at the hospital yesterday?

32:19.771 --> 32:22.273
Yes. She was with Uncle.

32:35.703 --> 32:38.456
Is it clear to you now
who Ho-su's father is?

32:41.167 --> 32:42.919
You must've had it easy in Ireland.

32:43.753 --> 32:47.090
Using Woo-jae as your nanny
when he had nothing to do with you.

32:51.511 --> 32:55.181
You wanted me to see
how it felt to lose someone precious.

32:56.182 --> 32:57.308
I felt it.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.311
Deeply to my bones.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.815
But that wasn't enough for you.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.651
How dare you drag my son into this again?

33:08.611 --> 33:10.279
Don't even try to make excuses.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.073
Your greed is driving

33:12.865 --> 33:14.409
your crazy, immature actions.

33:15.618 --> 33:18.287
Isn't it exhausting
to deceive people around you?

33:18.371 --> 33:19.288
Not at all.

33:20.248 --> 33:24.794
I will choose to lie to protect them
instead of digging the truth to ruin them.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.423
Do you trust your husband?

33:29.674 --> 33:31.759
You think he'll always be this forgiving?

33:33.469 --> 33:35.096
He's a man, after all.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.683
You don't think he can't cheat too?

33:40.977 --> 33:45.398
He's way richer and has
more opportunities to cheat than you.

33:45.481 --> 33:48.276
Do you want my husband to leave me now?

33:48.359 --> 33:50.028
Will that make things even?

33:51.362 --> 33:52.780
Why don't you seduce him then?

33:54.240 --> 33:56.784
Even if he does,
I will not give up on my life.

33:58.119 --> 34:01.539
Like you said, my husband has it all.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.876
So he wouldn't be attracted
to a twisted girl like you.

34:12.633 --> 34:14.635
Did you have to do that?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.679
I thought of you as my sister.

34:16.763 --> 34:20.016
I thought you were obsessed with me
because you were lonely as a kid.

34:20.099 --> 34:23.519
Wasn't approaching my kids enough?
How could you approach my husband now?

34:24.020 --> 34:25.396
You must stop.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.609
Goodness. Oh, no. Ms. Jeong.

34:30.151 --> 34:31.360
Get the car ready now.

34:31.444 --> 34:32.904
-Okay.
-Let's go to the hospital.

34:42.038 --> 34:45.917
Last time, I let it slide.
But I can't let this keep happening.

34:46.584 --> 34:48.878
I'm sure you had your reasons.

34:48.961 --> 34:52.215
But only the artists
are allowed to be eccentric here.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.758
However their behavior,

34:53.841 --> 34:57.845
we can pass it off
as long as they make good art.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.432
But as their supporters,
we cannot behave the same.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.646
I need you to leave.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.942
I rashly hired you
without knowing your history with her.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.427
If you're here to see me,
please don't from now on.

35:38.511 --> 35:39.470
I got fired.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.013
What?

35:41.097 --> 35:43.724
She might be a good sister to you.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.351
But to me, she's just a bitch.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.565
What? Are you upset
that I called her a bitch?

36:05.872 --> 36:07.290
I knew.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.379
I knew that you were her brother

36:13.880 --> 36:15.381
when I went to you.

36:46.078 --> 36:48.873
<i>Thank you for telling me. And I'm sorry.</i>

36:59.050 --> 37:01.886
<i>I killed a friend.</i>

37:21.113 --> 37:24.533
Hey, if you buy the complete set,
you'll get a free massage.

37:24.617 --> 37:25.910
Please call me.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.414
If you buy the complete set,
you'll get a free massage.

BEAUTY MARY MAKEUP

37:38.547 --> 37:39.590
Hey.

37:40.466 --> 37:42.677
What took you so long to call me back?

37:43.970 --> 37:46.847
Gosh, no. It wasn't a lot of work.

37:47.723 --> 37:51.310
By the way,
I worked really hard this time.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.231
When will I get to see you?

37:56.857 --> 37:59.151
Really? You're coming that day?

37:59.235 --> 38:00.486
Really?

38:01.237 --> 38:04.240
Gosh. I'm not doubting you.

38:05.741 --> 38:09.745
Then I should go there
with my clients this time.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.185
When I get old,
I want to be at peace like him.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.107
Your mother hasn't been coming by lately.

38:39.817 --> 38:40.901
She's well, right?

38:40.985 --> 38:44.530
Probably. She's with
one of my old students.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.784
I don't know
who's taking care of whom, though.

38:53.914 --> 38:56.334
Simple and old drinks are the best.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.836
The perfect drink of sweet and bitter.

39:03.507 --> 39:04.342
Yesterday…

39:09.263 --> 39:11.057
he waited a long while for you here.

PHYSICAL THERAPIST JEONG SEON-U

39:19.774 --> 39:21.067
You still haven't made up

39:22.318 --> 39:23.486
with your husband?

39:25.196 --> 39:26.572
I'm still angry at him.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.700
I know marriage is
solely between two people.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.453
But seeing how you're angry,
you must still have feelings.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.830
Not getting angry is more worrisome.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.248
I'm not sure…

39:38.042 --> 39:41.087
if I'm really angry…

39:43.130 --> 39:44.507
or obsessing over him

39:45.132 --> 39:47.968
because I know I'll be pathetic and lonely

39:48.844 --> 39:50.388
if he leaves me.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.271
It's sweet.

40:00.439 --> 40:01.941
Wait. No, It's bitter.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.071
It really is bittersweet.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.543
What happened?

40:21.961 --> 40:23.421
I got a small injury.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.464
How did that happen?

40:25.548 --> 40:28.259
I'm okay. It's just a small cut.

40:28.342 --> 40:29.885
And I needed it.

40:31.929 --> 40:35.307
I saw your mother this afternoon.
She told you, right?

40:35.891 --> 40:38.436
I told you not to worry.
She can be so stubborn.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.564
I'm a bit hungry.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.942
But why…

40:45.734 --> 40:46.735
Yes?

40:48.529 --> 40:50.906
<i>I don't ask why he didn't suspect</i>

40:52.241 --> 40:53.576
<i>Ho-su might not be his.</i>

40:56.537 --> 40:58.330
Want some <i>ramyeon</i>? It's been a while.

40:59.582 --> 41:00.624
<i>Ramyeon</i>?

41:02.751 --> 41:03.919
Sounds good.

41:25.232 --> 41:26.609
When did you get back?

41:48.797 --> 41:49.882
You…

41:51.634 --> 41:52.760
remember.

41:57.973 --> 41:59.808
Do you remember calling me?

42:00.684 --> 42:01.727
<i>Hae-won.</i>

42:02.686 --> 42:04.104
<i> I'll tell you everything
once I get there.</i>

42:04.730 --> 42:07.900
<i>I will tell you everything
and apologize to you properly.</i>

42:12.071 --> 42:13.072
It's late.

42:13.989 --> 42:16.116
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.664
You even went to Ireland.

42:23.582 --> 42:25.000
Don't you have anything to tell me?

42:27.211 --> 42:28.712
<i>I'm going to remember</i>

42:29.713 --> 42:31.298
<i>how I wronged you.</i>

42:31.966 --> 42:34.426
<i>And I'll ask
for your forgiveness until you finally do.</i>

42:34.927 --> 42:38.764
It pains me that I can't even remember
what I need to apologize for.

42:43.435 --> 42:45.521
Watching you break down because of me…

42:48.023 --> 42:49.400
is torturous.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.278
You have nothing to say to me?

43:13.549 --> 43:17.428
Several companies showed
interest in your idea, Mr. Seo.

43:18.387 --> 43:22.182
And our gallery put this together.

43:23.892 --> 43:27.104
I know it is a commercial ad,
but this will be a great opportunity

43:27.187 --> 43:28.689
to show people your art--

43:28.772 --> 43:29.815
Let's do it.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.277
I will do everything I can.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.487
Great. Shall we then?

43:36.697 --> 43:37.906
Yes.

43:51.253 --> 43:53.505
All right. Look over here. Here we go.

43:54.923 --> 43:57.134
Can you turn your head a bit?

43:57.217 --> 43:59.219
Great. All right. One more time.

43:59.303 --> 44:00.721
Great.

44:02.014 --> 44:03.223
You two look great.

44:10.814 --> 44:14.193
<i>Hey, this is starting
to scare me a little.</i>

44:14.777 --> 44:17.529
<i>It's awful your mother-in-law
took his DNA in front of you.</i>

44:17.613 --> 44:21.033
<i>But your husband must've
gotten the test done before that.</i>

44:22.034 --> 44:24.161
But I'm the worst of all.

44:25.412 --> 44:26.997
Even I wasn't sure.

44:28.415 --> 44:31.794
I'm the one who was most relieved
to see the results.

44:31.877 --> 44:33.504
Then

44:34.296 --> 44:36.715
it turned out better.
Now you know for sure.

44:37.883 --> 44:41.178
<i>Anyway, don't trust your husband too much.</i>

44:41.845 --> 44:44.139
He might've been able to let this one go.

44:45.432 --> 44:47.976
But it'll only take a moment
for him to lose his shit.

44:48.060 --> 44:50.145
And people who do that are the scariest.

44:50.229 --> 44:53.107
Hey, I'm getting a call.
I'll call you back later.

<i>Let's meet.</i>

45:22.177 --> 45:26.265
Gosh. How do you take such good care
of yourself? Your figure is perfect.

45:28.267 --> 45:30.561
She works out for over four hours a day.

45:30.644 --> 45:31.937
And massages on top of that.

45:39.194 --> 45:40.696
I heard Mom got something on you.

45:42.156 --> 45:45.868
That's too bad. Once she writes
anyone off, she never changes her mind.

45:45.951 --> 45:48.996
She's never really accepted me anyway.

45:50.831 --> 45:52.541
Nothing will change.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.129
How about you?

45:57.921 --> 45:59.214
Are you all right?

46:02.301 --> 46:04.219
I told you not to be so nosy.

46:06.263 --> 46:10.225
That's strange. I definitely measured her
last time she was fitted…

46:12.144 --> 46:17.065
Why do you think we make multiple trips
to come here for just one outfit?

46:17.941 --> 46:18.817
Pardon?

46:18.901 --> 46:22.529
We're paying you to make the clothes fit,
not the other way around.

46:22.613 --> 46:26.241
So keep your mouth shut
and just do your job. Okay?

46:28.202 --> 46:29.995
I'm sorry, ma'am.

46:30.496 --> 46:33.582
We use your service
because we respect you.

46:33.665 --> 46:36.543
Then you should also show us respect.

46:36.627 --> 46:40.714
Of course, ma'am.
It's because she's still learning.

46:40.797 --> 46:43.050
Let me apologize on her behalf.
I'm so sorry.

46:50.182 --> 46:53.560
You've been getting calls the whole time.
Who is it? Why not answer it?

46:53.644 --> 46:55.229
I can call back later.

<i>Can you check if it's straight?</i>

47:12.579 --> 47:14.957
-Okay. A bit more.
-Raise it higher.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.792
Can you make it nice and taut?

47:16.875 --> 47:18.335
WELCOME TO TAERIM HIGH SCHOOL OF ARTS

47:22.839 --> 47:26.176
INTENSIVE CLASS FOR INCOMING FIRST YEARS

47:30.138 --> 47:31.974
Coming here after graduating is lame.

47:32.766 --> 47:34.017
Why did you want to see me?

47:36.311 --> 47:38.689
Apologize again.
Your first apology only offended me.

47:42.234 --> 47:43.527
Apologize again!

47:45.404 --> 47:47.322
Did you think you could boss me around?

47:48.615 --> 47:52.035
You must've thought I'd let you walk
all over me because of what my dad did.

47:54.663 --> 47:56.039
But I don't care about that.

47:56.123 --> 47:58.584
I'm going to a different school.
I won't see you again.

48:00.335 --> 48:01.962
What if I tell everyone?

48:03.046 --> 48:05.591
Wherever you go,
whoever you become friends with,

48:05.674 --> 48:07.926
I'll tell everyone who you really are

48:08.010 --> 48:09.261
and what your dad did.

48:09.344 --> 48:11.346
Then I'll say why my dad did that.

48:12.264 --> 48:14.474
That your chairman dad
kicked us out of our house

48:14.558 --> 48:17.311
and you always got away
with bullying me thanks to your dad.

48:18.395 --> 48:19.980
Who will they criticize?

48:22.232 --> 48:25.611
Everyone around you is nice to you
because your family is rich.

48:26.612 --> 48:29.239
They like what you have, not who you are.

48:30.407 --> 48:33.285
That was you.
You mooched off me like a leech.

48:35.120 --> 48:37.581
-Think whatever you want.
-Where are you going?

48:39.291 --> 48:41.376
Hey! That hurts!

48:41.460 --> 48:45.714
TAERIM HIGH SCHOOL OF ARTS

49:33.178 --> 49:35.013
Hold on, Ho-su.

49:37.808 --> 49:38.767
Right here.

49:39.935 --> 49:45.023
Let's take a selfie to remember this day.
How should I do this?

49:49.653 --> 49:50.904
Yes, please…

49:53.490 --> 49:54.324
Here.

49:55.617 --> 49:58.954
Ho-su, he's going to take a photo of us.

49:59.037 --> 50:00.247
Good boy.

50:01.206 --> 50:02.165
Look over there.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.334
Okay. Here.

50:14.636 --> 50:16.054
Your son is beautiful.

50:16.638 --> 50:18.014
You're Korean.

50:18.640 --> 50:20.016
Thank you.

50:22.602 --> 50:24.688
Ho-su, let's take a photo.

50:24.771 --> 50:26.356
Look over there.

50:26.440 --> 50:29.151
One, two, three.

50:30.026 --> 50:33.155
Thank you. Say, "Thank you."

50:35.532 --> 50:38.160
"Thank you." Right?

50:38.827 --> 50:40.120
All right.

50:42.164 --> 50:45.375
-Mommy is back.
-What were you doing?

50:45.459 --> 50:47.002
-Come to Mommy.
-Here.

50:47.085 --> 50:49.796
There you go. We took a photo.

50:55.343 --> 50:56.553
That's true.

50:57.429 --> 51:00.682
Our lawyer requested
that our foundation help you.

51:02.476 --> 51:04.102
But I was the one who received

51:04.186 --> 51:08.482
your status reports when I visited Ireland
to handle some business matters.

51:09.941 --> 51:11.151
Is there a problem?

51:11.234 --> 51:13.695
No. I'm grateful.

51:14.696 --> 51:16.031
I am.

51:16.114 --> 51:19.326
But I'm curious how you found me
and transported me to the hospital.

51:20.952 --> 51:22.621
I couldn't find any incident report.

51:27.334 --> 51:30.045
<i>I heard you're back in Ireland.</i>

51:30.128 --> 51:31.463
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

51:54.569 --> 51:55.737
Where's Hui-ju?

51:56.446 --> 51:57.322
Hey.

51:59.282 --> 52:01.159
It's nice to see you here.

52:01.868 --> 52:05.247
She and I used to come here often.

52:05.330 --> 52:06.456
Did you know?

52:07.958 --> 52:11.086
She and I are married.
And I only believe what I see myself.

52:11.586 --> 52:15.340
You are here alone,
and she's where she belongs.

52:17.717 --> 52:20.512
How can you be sure she belongs with you?

52:21.805 --> 52:24.266
You tied her down with your stupid money.

52:24.766 --> 52:27.519
Neglecting her to fade away in a cage
is what she deserves?

52:28.979 --> 52:30.897
You have no idea

52:30.981 --> 52:34.067
how passionate Hui-ju can be.

52:42.784 --> 52:45.954
You're the one
who has no idea what she's like.

52:46.037 --> 52:48.415
And you don't have to.
So don't talk about her.

52:50.709 --> 52:53.253
There's no way
she fell for someone weak like you.

52:53.336 --> 52:55.130
It was my mistake for coming here.

52:57.632 --> 53:00.051
I was never interested in Hui-ju at first.

53:00.886 --> 53:03.346
But Hae-won wouldn't stop
talking about her.

53:04.973 --> 53:08.018
So it piqued my curiosity.
That's how it started.

53:08.768 --> 53:12.355
But it turned out she was nothing
more than just a lonely married woman.

53:13.648 --> 53:14.524
She was easy.

53:15.150 --> 53:17.944
She easily fell for me
after I made some advances.

53:18.987 --> 53:20.322
There was no fun in it.

53:24.618 --> 53:26.995
Were you always such a pathetic loser?

53:27.078 --> 53:30.624
Yes. She easily fell for a loser like me.

53:31.666 --> 53:33.710
You think
she'll be faithful to you forever?

53:51.019 --> 53:53.438
Since you're here,
why don't you pay for my drink?

53:54.439 --> 53:59.611
I've been enjoying my stay in Ireland
thanks to the money you've been sending.

56:01.357 --> 56:02.442
This isn't…

56:30.220 --> 56:34.808
HUI-JU

56:42.607 --> 56:43.525
Hey.

56:44.275 --> 56:46.611
<i>I've been calling you. Where are you?</i>

56:49.030 --> 56:50.073
I had…

56:52.325 --> 56:53.576
some work left to do.

56:54.494 --> 56:56.996
<i>I was worried.
You disappeared after we checked in.</i>

56:59.874 --> 57:00.917
Sorry.

57:04.712 --> 57:06.881
I'll be there soon.

57:17.100 --> 57:20.937
It is my understanding that
my lawyer gave you the incident report.

57:23.481 --> 57:25.608
Yes, I got it.

57:26.568 --> 57:28.736
But it's written in so much detail

57:29.821 --> 57:32.657
that I have the feeling
the most important part was buried.

57:35.493 --> 57:36.619
Buried?

57:38.705 --> 57:39.789
Nonsense.

57:40.874 --> 57:43.084
What would we need to bury
about your incident?

57:49.007 --> 57:50.216
Let's set a date.

57:51.384 --> 57:54.220
I'm sure my wife would
like to hear about your trip to Ireland.

57:54.304 --> 57:57.098
Why don't the three of us meet up soon?

57:57.182 --> 57:59.017
Actually, I already called her today.

58:00.435 --> 58:01.853
I'll see you next time.

CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE

58:20.246 --> 58:21.664
What are you doing here?

58:22.582 --> 58:24.417
I needed to ask your dad something.

58:25.168 --> 58:26.961
Ask what? What did you ask him?

58:27.045 --> 58:28.421
Do you read books?

58:29.464 --> 58:31.633
The flower you asked me
about before. The heath.

58:31.716 --> 58:35.178
That flower comes up a lot
in a novel called <i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

58:35.261 --> 58:36.471
Give it a read.

58:37.263 --> 58:39.557
What? What is that book about?

58:55.532 --> 58:58.451
<i>Your call could not be connected.
After the tone…</i>

DIRECTOR AN HYEON-SEONG

59:13.258 --> 59:14.217
Hello.

59:14.968 --> 59:16.761
Let's try that again.

59:16.844 --> 59:18.054
-Okay.
-Okay.

59:20.765 --> 59:24.227
Do you want us to die because
you are afraid of future criticism?

59:24.310 --> 59:28.356
What you're talking about right now
requires billions…

59:28.439 --> 59:32.151
I did hear that you're a fan of theatre
and even fund them

59:32.235 --> 59:34.070
when I was working at the school.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.364
I guess you really love them.

59:39.033 --> 59:40.910
We should suspend the contract.

59:41.578 --> 59:42.912
The gallery is just a start.

59:43.413 --> 59:45.915
Once I expand the gallery
into an art center…

59:47.750 --> 59:49.627
I plan to set up a theater there too.

59:50.211 --> 59:51.546
Thanks to my wife,

59:53.298 --> 59:56.175
I have a chance
to fulfill my dream at my age.

59:57.010 --> 59:58.219
Any other questions?

1:00:00.888 --> 1:00:05.143
I remember
when you took the entire faculty

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:07.729
to the opera.

1:00:11.566 --> 1:00:12.984
What was it called?

1:00:15.612 --> 1:00:17.280
<i>It was about a clown</i>

1:00:17.363 --> 1:00:20.283
<i>who had to entertain the audience
while his wife had an affair.</i>

1:00:22.577 --> 1:00:24.329
<i>It was your story.</i>

1:00:25.913 --> 1:00:27.332
<i>I saw that day</i>

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:30.293
<i>how much pain you were in.</i>

1:00:35.423 --> 1:00:37.550
If your limbs were broken or something,

1:00:38.343 --> 1:00:41.846
people would have tried
to understand your pain even for a moment.

1:00:43.181 --> 1:00:48.144
It's very hard to be understood
about pain no one else can see.

1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:54.942
Did Mr. Seo…

1:00:58.404 --> 1:01:00.323
get his memories back?

1:01:04.369 --> 1:01:06.079
You must've met him.

1:01:07.622 --> 1:01:09.874
I wanted him to get his memories back.

1:01:11.334 --> 1:01:13.503
But his reaction is totally unexpected.

1:01:17.632 --> 1:01:21.636
It must be even more flustering
for those who have something to hide.

1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:32.313
You're really going to sell it?

1:01:32.397 --> 1:01:33.356
Yes.

1:01:34.148 --> 1:01:36.901
I told you.
An ecological park will be built here.

1:01:36.984 --> 1:01:40.238
They wanted to rid of the cause
of pollution and improve water quality.

1:01:40.321 --> 1:01:44.367
So they are going to demolish
everything in this area

1:01:44.450 --> 1:01:46.285
including fishing spots and docks.

1:01:46.369 --> 1:01:49.914
But you know what I did?
I upped the compensation money.

1:01:56.504 --> 1:01:58.381
-Who is it?
-My mom.

1:01:59.465 --> 1:02:01.092
It must be her superpower.

1:02:02.635 --> 1:02:05.430
She always calls me
when I'm going through a hard time.

1:02:05.513 --> 1:02:07.056
What is it this time?

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:09.851
Exactly. What does she want this time?

1:02:10.518 --> 1:02:11.978
I'm not even curious.

1:02:13.604 --> 1:02:17.024
I'm just worried if I don't answer,
she might call my husband,

1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:19.819
and that my mother-in-law

1:02:20.486 --> 1:02:21.654
might find out.

1:02:25.032 --> 1:02:27.410
I think that must've been why.

1:02:27.493 --> 1:02:29.245
What? What do you mean?

1:02:30.371 --> 1:02:34.208
With Woo-jae, I didn't have
a mother-in-law I had to impress.

1:02:34.876 --> 1:02:38.671
And I didn't have to
be this good wife or mother.

1:02:40.089 --> 1:02:44.010
When I was with him, I could be myself,
forget about everything else,

1:02:44.719 --> 1:02:46.763
and just do what I wanted to do.

1:03:09.243 --> 1:03:11.120
I think I've given you enough time.

1:03:12.497 --> 1:03:13.706
So tell me.

1:03:18.252 --> 1:03:19.378
Let's break up.

1:03:21.672 --> 1:03:23.508
I should have done it a long time ago.

1:03:24.759 --> 1:03:25.885
But I was a coward.

1:03:27.011 --> 1:03:27.929
I'm sorry.

1:03:29.430 --> 1:03:30.306
You're sorry?

1:03:31.349 --> 1:03:32.433
Yes.

1:03:34.519 --> 1:03:38.439
So your memories really came back.
You haven't changed at all.

1:03:39.273 --> 1:03:41.526
You're not sorry at all.

1:03:41.609 --> 1:03:43.444
You already forgave yourself.

1:03:44.153 --> 1:03:45.988
That's why you're shamelessly telling me

1:03:46.531 --> 1:03:48.950
you want to break up
before apologizing to me.

1:03:49.033 --> 1:03:50.159
Break up with me.

1:03:50.952 --> 1:03:53.996
If you don't, I'll abandon you again.

1:03:54.747 --> 1:03:57.041
Again?

1:03:57.708 --> 1:04:01.462
What? Do you think you have a shot
with Hui-ju if you break up with me?

1:04:01.546 --> 1:04:02.672
I'll make it so.

1:04:03.756 --> 1:04:05.675
I'll be the man she deserves

1:04:06.342 --> 1:04:07.969
and make her come back to me.

1:04:08.052 --> 1:04:11.264
You're sick, Woo-jae. You're an addict.

1:04:11.889 --> 1:04:14.058
Alcohol and drugs
aren't the only addictions.

1:04:14.141 --> 1:04:15.601
You get addicted to people too.

1:04:15.685 --> 1:04:18.771
You know that you're
hurting others and ruining your life,

1:04:18.855 --> 1:04:21.482
but you can't let go or escape.

1:04:22.775 --> 1:04:24.068
That's an addiction.

1:04:24.652 --> 1:04:25.653
Are you any different?

1:04:27.071 --> 1:04:30.324
Can't you see how messed up you've become?

1:04:34.161 --> 1:04:35.121
Right.

1:04:36.289 --> 1:04:38.457
I became addicted
to Hui-ju along with you.

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:43.713
That's why you and I can
never escape each other.

1:04:55.683 --> 1:04:57.143
Who is it? Why don't you answer?

1:04:57.226 --> 1:05:00.187
It's my mom.
She's been calling me all day.

1:05:00.271 --> 1:05:01.772
Her restaurant opens this week.

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:03.691
Is it about the restaurant?

1:05:03.774 --> 1:05:06.277
No, it's nothing.
I already talked to her once earlier.

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:09.280
-You should still answer it.
-Don't.

1:05:10.364 --> 1:05:13.743
She must be feeling what I felt waiting
for her to call when she left home.

Don't. Don't leave.

1:06:38.786 --> 1:06:40.121
I told you.

1:06:40.204 --> 1:06:42.331
I forgive you. Don't leave me.

1:06:42.415 --> 1:06:45.334
I…

1:06:46.210 --> 1:06:48.254
I told you.

1:06:48.754 --> 1:06:52.133
I told you I love you.

1:07:19.577 --> 1:07:20.870
<i>That's so sudden.</i>

1:07:21.620 --> 1:07:23.414
Actually, it's not so sudden.

1:07:24.206 --> 1:07:28.419
Mr. Woo is quite old.
His illness must have worsened.

1:07:29.503 --> 1:07:32.048
And I think he always knew how bad it was.

1:07:32.131 --> 1:07:34.550
He probably thought
this would be his last project,

1:07:34.633 --> 1:07:36.969
so he was especially
attached to this project.

1:07:37.053 --> 1:07:40.639
Then we should make it special for him.

1:07:41.974 --> 1:07:44.351
So I was wondering if it would be okay

1:07:44.435 --> 1:07:48.230
to display his old pieces
at this exhibition.

1:07:49.565 --> 1:07:51.901
They're a part
of Korean architectural history.

1:07:51.984 --> 1:07:53.944
Designs are also artwork.

1:07:54.028 --> 1:07:56.072
The models are amazing too.

1:07:56.864 --> 1:07:59.617
Instead of simply exhibiting his work,

1:07:59.700 --> 1:08:02.495
can we do something special with them?

1:08:03.579 --> 1:08:06.290
I will have to see them
in person to get inspired.

1:08:06.373 --> 1:08:10.336
Mr. Woo already donated them to us,
so I already brought them here.

1:08:13.339 --> 1:08:16.217
Goodness. I told them to organize these.

1:08:18.302 --> 1:08:20.054
-Excuse me for a moment.
-Okay.

1:08:20.137 --> 1:08:24.517
Yes. Actually, I was going to call you.

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:26.143

1:08:50.751 --> 1:08:52.336
I don't care if you're married.

1:08:53.796 --> 1:08:56.757
I never cared about that then,
and I still don't.

1:08:58.717 --> 1:09:00.052
You're good at it.

1:09:01.595 --> 1:09:03.472
You can have a marriage with him

1:09:04.807 --> 1:09:06.183
and be in love with me.

1:09:12.398 --> 1:09:13.399
You…

1:09:19.613 --> 1:09:20.656
Ms. Jeong?

1:09:26.662 --> 1:09:29.748
Goodness, Mr. Seo. You came really early.

1:09:29.832 --> 1:09:31.417
I wanted to see the artwork beforehand.

1:09:33.627 --> 1:09:35.254
Where's Ms. Jeong?

1:09:35.337 --> 1:09:37.590
You didn't see her? She was just here.

1:09:40.134 --> 1:09:41.427
Ms. Jeong?

1:10:00.446 --> 1:10:03.032
Answer me. You didn't give me your answer.

1:10:04.992 --> 1:10:06.493
What answer?

1:10:07.077 --> 1:10:08.495
Go out with me.

1:10:08.579 --> 1:10:09.538
Why would I?

1:10:10.956 --> 1:10:11.999
Have you gone mad?

1:10:14.501 --> 1:10:16.462
Then why did you see me back then?

1:10:18.172 --> 1:10:19.089
Out of loneliness?

1:10:21.675 --> 1:10:23.928
Out of boredom? For fun?

1:10:25.846 --> 1:10:28.557
Yes! And I don't want this now.

1:10:32.603 --> 1:10:35.481
What brings you here?
Why didn't you call me you were coming?

1:10:37.233 --> 1:10:39.193
I thought you wouldn't answer it.

1:10:39.276 --> 1:10:42.696
-What are you talking--
-Let's go. We'll talk on the way.

1:10:43.447 --> 1:10:46.283
I'll call you again, Ms. Jeong.

1:10:47.993 --> 1:10:49.078
Sure.

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:13.560
SEATS AVAILABLE UPSTAIRS
OPEN 24 HOURS

1:11:23.654 --> 1:11:25.906
My son-in-law is the chairman of a school.

1:11:25.990 --> 1:11:27.324
-Gosh.
-The chairman.

1:11:27.408 --> 1:11:28.701
-Gosh.
-You must be so happy.

1:11:29.368 --> 1:11:30.828
-Please enjoy.
-Sure.

1:11:30.911 --> 1:11:33.080
-Come often. She's my mother-in-law.
-Thank you.

1:11:34.707 --> 1:11:37.334
It's only once or twice a year. I'm fine.

1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:40.921
I called her because
I was concerned. I did.

1:11:41.755 --> 1:11:44.008
She doesn't appreciate your efforts.

1:11:44.883 --> 1:11:46.343
Don't be nice to my mom.

1:11:49.430 --> 1:11:51.098
But you're good to my mom.

1:11:51.807 --> 1:11:53.392
That's different.

1:11:54.059 --> 1:11:55.227
How is it different?

1:12:02.735 --> 1:12:03.819
Earlier today,

1:12:04.945 --> 1:12:07.990
we had a last-minute meeting

1:12:08.073 --> 1:12:11.201
because the architect on our project
had suddenly fallen ill.

1:12:11.827 --> 1:12:13.203
Don't get the wrong idea.

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:16.332
I won't.

1:12:18.334 --> 1:12:22.129
The look on your face told me
that you were uncomfortable around him.

1:12:24.798 --> 1:12:27.509
Your mother put
a lot of effort into this restaurant.

1:12:27.593 --> 1:12:31.305
She handpicked all the dishes on the menu.
And she's taking care of everything.

1:12:32.973 --> 1:12:34.266
She's working really hard.

1:12:34.767 --> 1:12:37.019
It's nice to support her when she is.

1:12:39.021 --> 1:12:40.647
I hope it works out.

1:12:42.149 --> 1:12:43.901
<i>This act of kindness isn't for her.</i>

1:12:47.196 --> 1:12:50.616
Can you please play with me?

1:12:50.699 --> 1:12:52.034
How should I play with you?

1:12:52.785 --> 1:12:54.953
Ho-su, it's time to go to bed now.

1:12:56.121 --> 1:12:57.414
You have a lot of work. Go.

1:12:57.498 --> 1:12:59.541
-I'll tuck him in.
-Thank you.

1:12:59.625 --> 1:13:02.211
What do you say? Should I tuck you in?

1:13:05.047 --> 1:13:06.215
<i>He is…</i>

1:13:07.758 --> 1:13:08.926
<i>showing me</i>

1:13:09.968 --> 1:13:13.555
<i>my weaknesses one by one.</i>

1:13:20.479 --> 1:13:22.231
<i>I don't care if you're married.</i>

1:13:22.314 --> 1:13:25.025
<i>I never cared about that then,
and I still don't.</i>

1:13:25.734 --> 1:13:26.985
<i>You're good at it.</i>

1:13:28.612 --> 1:13:30.531
You can have a marriage with him

1:13:31.865 --> 1:13:33.409
and be in love with me.

1:13:46.964 --> 1:13:53.637
SEO WOO-JAE

1:14:08.694 --> 1:14:11.405
Did you call me here,
so I can watch you throw a fit?

1:14:13.407 --> 1:14:15.325
I don't know what people want.

1:14:19.413 --> 1:14:21.457
I must do it even if I have to fake it.

1:14:23.417 --> 1:14:24.543
But this is…

1:14:31.425 --> 1:14:32.509
Don't go.

1:14:33.427 --> 1:14:34.636
I'm trying.

1:14:35.262 --> 1:14:36.889
Can't you just put up with me…

1:14:39.057 --> 1:14:40.350
even if I throw a fit?

1:14:44.396 --> 1:14:47.107
Mr. Seo. Listen carefully.

1:14:47.983 --> 1:14:50.652
I came here to give you my answer
because I didn't want

1:14:50.736 --> 1:14:52.779
the lack of my answer to mislead you.

1:14:54.573 --> 1:14:57.159
Once this project is over,

1:14:57.242 --> 1:14:59.536
you and I are colleagues
who will never meet again.

1:15:00.787 --> 1:15:01.872
That's all.

1:15:07.085 --> 1:15:08.253
You have

1:15:09.671 --> 1:15:11.006
my answer now. All right?

1:15:29.107 --> 1:15:30.817
This was a present from you.

1:15:32.611 --> 1:15:34.655
You took everything, but not this.

1:15:39.993 --> 1:15:43.413
You shouldn't have left without giving me
a chance to make it work.

1:16:04.643 --> 1:16:06.228
I'll do better this time.

1:16:09.022 --> 1:16:10.023
Give me a chance.

1:16:22.202 --> 1:16:23.954
Do you remember what you told me?

1:16:26.248 --> 1:16:27.457
You said

1:16:28.834 --> 1:16:32.212
a broken marriage wasn't something
you could piece back together.

1:16:36.967 --> 1:16:38.051
Come back

1:16:39.094 --> 1:16:40.137
to me.

1:16:43.974 --> 1:16:45.684
Love me like you did back then.

1:16:47.102 --> 1:16:48.770
You can throw me away again.

1:16:49.730 --> 1:16:51.398
That's my burden to bear.

1:16:52.316 --> 1:16:54.526
I'll endure the broken heart.

1:16:58.655 --> 1:17:00.157
So just love me now.

1:17:19.968 --> 1:17:22.137
I won't let you run off this time.

1:17:23.472 --> 1:17:25.015
I'm going to get back everything

1:17:26.683 --> 1:17:27.851
that I lost.

1:18:12.938 --> 1:18:15.023
<i>When will you stop clinging to the past?</i>

1:18:15.107 --> 1:18:16.566
<i>Don't long for it.</i>

1:18:18.276 --> 1:18:20.028
Who are you to judge my feelings?

1:18:20.112 --> 1:18:22.072
<i>I haven't even started yet.</i>

1:18:22.155 --> 1:18:25.742
Take good care of her.
She seems to be struggling lately.

1:18:25.826 --> 1:18:27.035
I'm not her husband anymore.

1:18:28.787 --> 1:18:30.080
<i>So what makes you so different?</i>

1:18:30.163 --> 1:18:32.124
You enjoyed it while knowing his feelings.

1:18:32.207 --> 1:18:33.709
<i>You're just a cheater.</i>

1:18:33.792 --> 1:18:35.377
<i>Hui-ju doesn't want you back.</i>

1:18:35.460 --> 1:18:38.213
<i>What have you done to him?</i>

1:18:38.296 --> 1:18:39.798
<i>He's a man, after all.</i>

1:18:41.049 --> 1:18:42.092
Then choose.

1:18:42.175 --> 1:18:45.470
Is it your family or that bastard?

1:18:45.554 --> 1:18:46.430
Let me go!

1:18:47.305 --> 1:18:49.307
<i>I will kill anyone</i>

1:18:51.309 --> 1:18:52.477
<i>who dares to harm you.</i>
