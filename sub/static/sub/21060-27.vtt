-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:40.800
in a court of law.

00:43.100 --> 00:44.433
-I've always wanted to be a cop.

00:44.467 --> 00:47.100
I remember when I was little,
uh, back in elementary school,

00:47.133 --> 00:49.267
I wrote a note saying
I wanted to be a cop,

00:49.300 --> 00:50.967
and I put it in a time capsule.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.233
I remember looking back at it
a couple years ago,

00:53.267 --> 00:55.600
uh, seeing that now,
now that I am a cop,

00:55.633 --> 00:58.667
I love it.
It's great, uh, Adams County
Sheriffs Department's

00:58.700 --> 01:02.767
a great agency to work for,
and I could definitely
see myself retiring here.

01:04.267 --> 01:05.933
Uh, we're tryin' to catch up
to this vehicle.

01:05.967 --> 01:08.933
It's traveling
at a high rate of speed.
I'm just gonna pull it over

01:08.967 --> 01:11.467
and I'll let him know
that he's going too fast.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.500
-(siren blares)

01:17.867 --> 01:19.633
-(siren blaring)

01:19.667 --> 01:22.167
-Uh, he's not stopping for us.

01:22.200 --> 01:26.133
-(radio chatter)

01:26.167 --> 01:29.733
-Six-eight, he's failing
to yield. I'm gonna continue

01:29.767 --> 01:33.467
northbound on Huron,
passing Milky Way,
speed's 46.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.300
-(radio chatter)

01:37.833 --> 01:42.133
-Okay, he's about to wreck out.
We're on Fox goin' eastbound,

01:42.167 --> 01:43.600
and he's goin' off the road.

01:43.633 --> 01:47.833
-(sirens continue)
-Have it on a red-- looks
like a Jeep, red Jeep.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.800
Occupied times one.

01:54.133 --> 01:56.133
Six-- Uh, foot bail.

02:01.533 --> 02:03.567
Police! Stop!

02:04.833 --> 02:08.067
-(radio chatter)

02:09.433 --> 02:13.133
-Male, white, uh, gray shirt,
blue jeans, blue shorts, I mean.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.800
I lost him around the corner.

02:15.833 --> 02:20.133
-(radio chatter)

02:24.867 --> 02:27.200
-Woman (on radio):
Confirming southbound
through the apartment complex.

02:29.600 --> 02:34.467
-(panting)

02:37.133 --> 02:39.367
Uh, six-eight, I got him,
he's running down the hill

02:39.400 --> 02:40.833
towards the ditch.

02:42.533 --> 02:46.833
(panting)

02:49.133 --> 02:52.967
Six-eight, I think he--
I think he dipped
into the ravine... Rick.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.600
He, uh... I didn't see him
going over to the other side.

02:56.633 --> 02:58.800
He's probably bedded down
somewhere in this brush.

02:58.833 --> 03:01.433
Have you assembled
the northside?

03:01.467 --> 03:04.700
I believe there's
an apartment complex.

03:04.733 --> 03:06.833
He hasn't come out
of the ditch yet.

03:06.867 --> 03:08.567
(panting)

03:08.600 --> 03:11.067
Man (over radio): He's beyond
the north side of 88,

03:11.100 --> 03:12.600
on the south side
of the apartment complex.

03:12.633 --> 03:15.233
-Hey! Hey!

03:15.267 --> 03:17.367
I'll Taze you right now!

03:19.333 --> 03:21.700
-Don't move.
-Six-eight, we have him.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.067
-(radio chatter)

03:30.100 --> 03:31.700
-Why you runnin', man?

03:31.733 --> 03:33.633
-I got warrants.
-You got warrants?

03:33.667 --> 03:35.500
You gonna
put people's-- Huh?

03:35.533 --> 03:36.933
-It's Mark.
-Mark?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.067
-Bro!
-I know.

03:38.067 --> 03:39.433
-Bro!
-I know.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.767
-(panting)
-We've got him in custody.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.800
-Bro!
Get up, man.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.233
-I have warrants.
-Do you have any weapons?

03:45.267 --> 03:46.700
-No weapons.
-Do you have any weapons?

03:46.733 --> 03:48.900
-No weapons at all, bro,
I got nothin' on me.
-Come on, dude.

03:48.933 --> 03:50.967
You know better than this.
Get up.

03:53.067 --> 03:56.800
-Man (over radio):
There's only one outstanding.
-Get up.

03:56.833 --> 03:59.500
-He's got one
outstanding... (indistinct)

03:59.533 --> 04:01.200
-Dude, you're gonna
hurt somebody, man.

04:01.233 --> 04:03.133
-I know.
-You have a girl,
a little girl.

04:03.167 --> 04:04.700
-Yes, I know, bro.
-You know that.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.667
-(radio chatter)

04:06.700 --> 04:09.500
-You still with Amber?
-Yeah. Can you call her
for me?

04:09.533 --> 04:11.800
-We'll see, man.
Come on.

04:11.833 --> 04:14.300
You put a lot of us
in danger, bro.
-I know.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.233
-Have a seat.

04:23.533 --> 04:27.867
Since he, uh, ran,
we get to search his vehicle,
warrant to arrest.

04:29.467 --> 04:31.800
Let's see if we have
any weapons or drugs.

04:36.733 --> 04:39.867
He does got warrants,
he's got five warrants
out of multiple cities.

04:39.900 --> 04:43.700
-(radio chatter)

04:43.733 --> 04:44.733
-Yeah, I'll take it.

04:46.067 --> 04:48.967
-For safekeeping.
-Yeah.

04:49.067 --> 04:51.367
Bit of marijuana.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.833
Don't know if he was using
while he was driving.

04:53.867 --> 04:57.667
-(radio chatter)
-All right.

04:57.700 --> 05:00.100
Everything else
is mostly clothes.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.800
You know why I was
pulling you over
or tryin' to pull you over?

05:02.833 --> 05:04.300
-No, I didn't think
I was speedin'.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.400
-Okay, you were goin'--
I mean, you were goin'
a little fast.

05:06.433 --> 05:07.900
It was no--
It was noticeable.

05:07.933 --> 05:08.967
Yeah, it was noticeable.

05:09.067 --> 05:11.933
Okay?
So, how come
you didn't stop?

05:11.967 --> 05:14.133
-My daughter's birthday
is tomorrow, but
I got warrants.

05:14.167 --> 05:16.367
I was just tryin'
to go home.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.100
Just had a stupid plan.
Run home, (bleep).

05:19.133 --> 05:21.200
-We don't wanna ruin your--
your daughter's birthday.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.700
You know I--
You know I don't.

05:22.733 --> 05:23.967
-I did that myself.
I did that myself.

05:24.067 --> 05:26.067
That's my-- It's my fault.
I know that.

05:26.100 --> 05:29.467
-Okay, were you worried
about endangering anybody
over here or no?

05:29.500 --> 05:32.800
-Yeah, of course, but I know
everyone is sleepin' too,
or (bleep).

05:32.833 --> 05:34.933
Car got out of control,
that's what that was, uh,

05:34.967 --> 05:36.500
that made me do
all that (bleep).

05:36.533 --> 05:37.967
It is my fault.
-Okay.

05:38.067 --> 05:40.067
-It is my fault.
I know what I did that's...

05:40.100 --> 05:41.700
-Look, I-- I appreciate
you being honest.

05:41.733 --> 05:44.200
Okay? I really do.
It-- It's gonna show.

05:44.233 --> 05:48.200
Okay? But, you know,
your-- your charges
right-- right now, okay,

05:48.233 --> 05:54.067
are vehicular eluding, okay?
Um, resisting arrest,
and criminal mischief.

05:54.067 --> 05:56.067
At least. Okay?
And then speeding.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.067
Okay?
You're not gonna
be gone forever.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.200
-Yeah, I know.
-Okay? But you know
what you did, right?

06:00.233 --> 06:02.467
-Yeah.
-How we gonna
fix this, bro?

06:02.500 --> 06:05.633
-Get my warrants cleared up
and get back on track.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.167
-Can you do that?
-Yeah. You know I can.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.867
-I hope so, bro.
-This is all over a bunch of
(bleep) stupid traffic tickets.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.300
-I know.
-Nothin' big, you know
what I mean?

06:13.333 --> 06:15.933
It's not like...
-Right, but it led up
to this, man.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.567
-Yeah, true.
-'Cause I-- I don't--
I don't want--

06:17.600 --> 06:19.367
I don't wanna
take you away
from your girls.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.900
You know, this-- this hurts me
as much as you it-- it's
killin' you right now.

06:21.933 --> 06:23.067
-That's true.
-Okay, 'cause I know

06:23.067 --> 06:24.133
you care
about your girls, right?

06:24.167 --> 06:25.467
-Yeah. Always.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.900
It's just-- It was
a stupid decision

06:26.933 --> 06:30.267
is... all it was.
A stupid decision.

06:30.300 --> 06:33.500
-Okay.
All right, man.

06:33.533 --> 06:35.100
-Yeah, thankfully,
no one else
was on the road.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.367
-I thought he was gonna
wreck up when he was
comin' across the field.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.733
I thought he was actually
gonna come across
and hit cars.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.633
-And it looked like
when he turned on
to Fox here,

06:41.667 --> 06:44.233
he was gonna
go right into that
apartment complex.

06:44.267 --> 06:45.500
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:45.533 --> 06:47.267
I'm glad he didn't.
He gained control, at least.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.933
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Put it in there.
I think that's why

06:48.967 --> 06:51.367
he bailed on foot,
'cause once he came down
here, he knew there's no way

06:51.400 --> 06:52.400
for him to go.
-Yeah.

06:52.433 --> 06:53.600
-So...
-Yeah.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.733
-I didn't see him
try to stop the vehicle at all.

06:55.767 --> 06:57.933
-Yeah. Yep.
-It could've been a lot worse,
that's for sure.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.133
-Um, I've been on the department
18 years now.

07:03.167 --> 07:05.167
I'm a beat officer right now,

07:05.200 --> 07:07.533
but I did work
special assignment
in the Exploited

07:07.567 --> 07:08.767
and Missing Children's unit.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.133
I take pride in working
human trafficking cases

07:11.167 --> 07:14.767
involving juveniles,
because those are victims
that don't have a voice.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.333
Any chance I get
to do some mentoring

07:16.367 --> 07:19.833
for these young girls
and boys out here
that get caught up

07:19.867 --> 07:22.267
in this human trafficking world
that we have right now,

07:22.300 --> 07:27.233
um, I try to... I try to
make sure I make time for that.

07:27.267 --> 07:31.500
Central and St. Francis,
I'll be behind a car
if there's somebody close.

07:33.067 --> 07:35.600
It's gonna be a white
Monte Carlo, looks like
a 60-day tag.

07:35.633 --> 07:38.700
They're, uh, aimin' somethin'
out of the driver's side.

07:42.533 --> 07:44.233
E-L-T, I'm gonna stay
a little bit behind 'em,

07:44.267 --> 07:46.067
so they don't
point that out again.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.933
-(radio chatter)

07:50.900 --> 07:53.533
-Man (over radio):
No, we're gonna try
and stop it now.

07:58.067 --> 07:59.333
-They're gonna be runnin'.

07:59.367 --> 08:01.667
Might've thrown somethin' out
at QuikTrip's.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.867
-(siren blaring)
-Looks like we had some shots
fired out of a vehicle,

08:06.900 --> 08:09.100
um, that's in front of me.

08:09.133 --> 08:11.400
Looks like
two black males, maybe.

08:11.433 --> 08:15.133
-(siren continues)

08:15.167 --> 08:17.533
-The passenger looked like
a black male in a black hoodie

08:17.567 --> 08:19.600
with some white writing.
I don't know what the driver is.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.467
-(siren continues)

08:21.500 --> 08:23.800
-(radio chatter)

08:25.800 --> 08:29.167
-Man (over radio):
Hold on.
We're stoppin', Harry.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.500
-Go! Go!

08:31.533 --> 08:34.733
Let me see your hands!
-Turn the car off!

08:34.767 --> 08:38.867
-Let me see your hands!
-Back seat, passenger side,

08:38.900 --> 08:42.533
I want you to open
the car door, keep
your hands up.

08:42.567 --> 08:46.200
-One at a time!
-One at a time,
one at a time!

08:47.267 --> 08:50.900
-Driver!
With your hands up,
step out!

08:52.667 --> 08:55.133
-Door's-- Door's
comin' open.

08:55.167 --> 08:58.700
I got one hand,
left hand.
I got two hands.

08:58.733 --> 09:02.167
There's a cell phone
in the left hand, keys
in the right, I think.

09:02.200 --> 09:06.067
-Face away from me.
Step to your left.

09:06.100 --> 09:09.367
Step to your left!
Walk backwards.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.233
Hands over your head,
walk backwards.

09:13.267 --> 09:17.567
Keep coming.
Keep coming.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.200
Stop.
-Get on your knees.

09:19.233 --> 09:21.200
-Get on your knees,
with your hands on top
of your head.

09:21.233 --> 09:22.567
Hands on top of your head.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.867
-Get on your face.
Hands out!

09:24.900 --> 09:27.467
-Man (over radio):
We'll send a couple people
up to clear the car, just hold.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.067
There some people over here,
that are gonna clear the car.

09:30.067 --> 09:31.933
-You ready?
We goin' up?

09:31.967 --> 09:33.400
-We're gonna go up.

09:33.433 --> 09:35.500
-Woman (over radio):
Does anybody
have that tag number?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.200
-Yeah, it's a 60-day tag.

09:37.233 --> 09:41.067
-Car is clear.
-I'll need an officer to go
to Lincoln and St. Francis,

09:41.067 --> 09:45.167
where the shots were fired, and,
Dispatch, if you had anybody
call it in, can you let me know?

09:45.200 --> 09:47.300
Well, as I was sittin'
on the corner, I heard
some gunshots,

09:47.333 --> 09:50.167
and some drivers
were pointin' at this
vehicle, which decided

09:50.200 --> 09:52.800
that it was gonna
run from us, so now we're
searchin' to see

09:52.833 --> 09:54.867
if there's any
weapons in the car.

09:54.900 --> 09:57.533
-He said that the guy
in the front told him
to stop here,

09:57.567 --> 10:00.200
so he stopped here.
He's got a suspended
driver's license.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.867
-Okay.
-And you don't know
where you were comin' from?

10:02.900 --> 10:05.800
-I-- I don't know the street
or any of that, like I said,
if I knew, I would--

10:05.833 --> 10:08.500
I'd let you--
-Were you comin'
from your cousin's house?

10:08.533 --> 10:11.700
-Like I said, the last time--
the last place that I knew
where my cousin lived

10:11.733 --> 10:15.500
was right off, uh, like,
uh, Bones liquor store.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.000
-So were you all
just rollin' around or what?

10:17.033 --> 10:19.767
-I mean, he-- that's what
he told me to come get him from.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.100
-Was Bones?
-No.

10:21.133 --> 10:22.700
-Or his house?
-I'm sayin'
from over here.

10:22.733 --> 10:24.700
-Where was that at?
-I mean, so I don't know
if that was--

10:24.733 --> 10:26.267
I don't-- that's what
I'm saying, I don't know.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.767
Like I said, we got
to some railroad tracks--

10:27.800 --> 10:29.000
-And then a homeboy
hops in the car?

10:29.033 --> 10:30.700
-I didn't-- I didn't see
no streets or--

10:30.733 --> 10:33.200
No, his-- his-- his friends
hopped in with him.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.233
-How many friends?

10:34.267 --> 10:35.633
-Uh, two?
-Two?

10:35.667 --> 10:37.367
-I wanna say
at least two or three.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.867
-Was that how many people
were in the car when it stopped?

10:39.900 --> 10:42.233
Or just how many got out?
-I think-- I mean...

10:42.267 --> 10:45.100
-It was your car!
-I didn't-- I wasn't...

10:45.133 --> 10:48.100
keepin' count or track
or any of that.

10:48.133 --> 10:49.467
-So you don't know
nothin' about nothin'?

10:49.500 --> 10:53.133
-I-- I-- I-- heh--
-(both laugh)

10:53.167 --> 10:56.900
-So, when the vehicle stopped,
I backtracked it about down
the block to where

10:56.933 --> 10:58.533
they made their first turn.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.867
As I walked,
I got on the west curb,

11:00.900 --> 11:02.533
and I found a firearm
layin' right here

11:02.567 --> 11:04.633
that matched the description
of the same size caliber

11:04.667 --> 11:07.667
that we found
shell casings for.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.233
You know exactly
who had the gun in the car.

11:10.267 --> 11:11.800
Correct?

11:11.833 --> 11:15.067
-I... I really don't.

11:15.067 --> 11:18.067
-It takes longer
to think about comin' up
with a lie,

11:18.067 --> 11:20.933
and I can see the wheels
are spinnin' in your head.

11:20.967 --> 11:23.233
Tell me an easy one.
How many shots were fired?

11:27.967 --> 11:29.533
-Two, I guess?
-Two, okay.

11:29.567 --> 11:30.933
-I mean, I--
-Who was the shooter?

11:30.967 --> 11:32.467
Was somebody shooting
at something--

11:32.500 --> 11:35.067
We gonna go to court,
'cause I-- I ain't shoot,
not nothin'.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.400
-I didn't say you--
-I can't drive and shoot
at the same time, so...

11:37.433 --> 11:39.500
-I-- Well...
-...you can't place not nothin'.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.900
"Well, well, well," what?
I'm good, but I ain't
that good.

11:42.933 --> 11:45.700
If I ain't never been
a shooter, than I'm
not a shooter.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.667
This my life you're
talkin' about.
-This is your life, yeah.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.433
-Right, so, like I said,
I don't-- right, I don't--

11:50.467 --> 11:53.167
-You're try-- You're trying
to open up your own
Pizza Hut, like you said.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.433
-Right.
My first thing's I--
I mean, like I said, I'm--

11:55.467 --> 11:58.567
I'm-- I'm tryin' to get
my own Pizza Hut,
so what would I--

11:58.600 --> 12:00.533
I mean, I have (bleep) to lose.

12:00.567 --> 12:02.833
I-- I don't know,
like they said, I don't know
if it was comin'

12:02.867 --> 12:04.800
from the left side,
the right side--
-So you-- So you know--

12:04.833 --> 12:06.233
So you know--
So you know
we found the gun.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.667
Right?
-Uh-- Hey, man,
that's-- that's--

12:08.700 --> 12:10.633
-Are your fingerprint--
We're testin' it for DNA

12:10.667 --> 12:12.667
and fingerprints
and everything.
Are your fingerprints

12:12.700 --> 12:14.300
gonna come up on this--
-(bleep) It might be,

12:14.333 --> 12:15.833
'cause I might've been
tryin' to keep him down

12:15.867 --> 12:18.233
from doin' whatever
the (bleep), hey, chill out
or somethin'.

12:18.267 --> 12:21.400
-What?
-Some (bleep) like that,
but other than that,

12:21.433 --> 12:23.533
I mean... (bleep).
Like I said, I--

12:23.567 --> 12:25.933
-Tell-- Tell me why
they might be on the gun.

12:25.967 --> 12:28.233
-Because I was tryin'
to keep somebody
from touchin' it

12:28.267 --> 12:30.467
or doin' somethin' crazy, or...

12:30.500 --> 12:33.133
-Tell me about that, then.
-I mean, like I said,

12:33.167 --> 12:36.567
I mean, people crazy.
Like I said, I got (bleep)
to lose.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.200
-Okay, why-- why
are your fingerprints
on the gun?

12:39.233 --> 12:41.533
-Because
I got (bleep) to lose!
(laughs)

12:41.567 --> 12:43.467
-Okay.
-I want people to be safe!

12:43.500 --> 12:45.833
-Tell me the story
how your fingerprints
got on the gun.

12:45.867 --> 12:47.800
-Because I have (bleep)
to lose.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.433
-That makes no sense.

12:49.467 --> 12:51.467
Did you grab the gun
after it was shot?

12:51.500 --> 12:54.067
-Probably.
-I wasn't there.
Why are you--

12:54.067 --> 12:55.733
Why are you
goin' "probably"?

12:55.767 --> 12:57.433
-I ain't did no nothin'.

12:57.467 --> 13:00.267
I'm a fool,
but I ain't a damn fool.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.567
-Okay.
-Period.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.133
-Uh, we just got done
searchin' the vehicle,

13:04.167 --> 13:06.433
and in the front driver's seat
on the floorboard

13:06.467 --> 13:09.367
was a live 40 round--
uh, 40 caliber round.

13:09.400 --> 13:13.067
So the charges that I have
right now is gonna be
the, uh, traffic pursuit,

13:13.067 --> 13:15.133
um, all the traffic charges
with him there,

13:15.167 --> 13:18.633
um, the driving on suspended.
Uh, we're waitin' on his
criminal history to come back,

13:18.667 --> 13:21.133
but right now we have, uh,
criminal discharge of a firearm

13:21.167 --> 13:24.500
in the city limits.
Now, if he comes back
a felon, then we'll have

13:24.533 --> 13:26.633
felon possession
of a firearm also.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.933
-Workin' nights
on the Wichita Police
Department's great.

13:31.967 --> 13:33.933
I work with a great group
of officers,

13:33.967 --> 13:36.100
uh, who, we all depend
on each other

13:36.133 --> 13:38.067
and are a tight, close group.

13:38.067 --> 13:41.967
Uh, actually makes the shift
go by faster when you enjoy

13:42.067 --> 13:44.500
workin' with each other.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.867
So I just ran the plates
on this truck,

13:45.900 --> 13:47.867
and it comes back stolen.

13:49.133 --> 13:52.300
-(siren blares)

13:52.333 --> 13:53.467
Let me see your hands!

13:55.067 --> 13:56.133
Let me see your hands!

13:56.167 --> 13:58.067
-What is it, sir?
-I'm stopped.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.133
Give me the air.

13:59.167 --> 14:00.367
-What is it, sir?

14:00.400 --> 14:02.600
-Step out.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.233
Step out.
I'll explain everything
in a minute.

14:05.267 --> 14:08.667
Passenger, stay in the vehicle.
Let me see both hands.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.633
Let me see both hands!

14:10.667 --> 14:12.900

14:12.933 --> 14:18.267
-What'd I do?
-Here...
face away from me.

14:18.300 --> 14:22.700
-What's somethin' I do?
-Step out
and face away from me.

14:22.733 --> 14:25.867
Sir!
Stick your hands

14:25.900 --> 14:27.500
-Yeah, I'm scared!

14:27.533 --> 14:29.200
-Step out!

14:29.233 --> 14:31.400
Step out of the car!

14:31.433 --> 14:35.333
Sir!
Step out of the car!

14:35.367 --> 14:36.867
He's not listenin' to commands.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.967
Sir, step out--
Let me see your hands!

14:39.067 --> 14:40.667
Let me see your hands!

14:40.700 --> 14:42.933

My hands! My hands!

14:42.967 --> 14:44.167
-Get out of the car!

14:44.200 --> 14:46.233
-Okay!
-Get out-- Turn around!

14:46.267 --> 14:48.133
-I'm out, sir.
I'm turnin' around,
don't hit me.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.067
Please, please, don't get me.
Please, don't!

14:50.067 --> 14:52.133
-Walk backwards
to my voice!

14:52.167 --> 14:53.567
There's one more
in the car.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.767
-I'm scared, I'm scared.
-All right, stop.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.867
Now get on your belly.

14:58.900 --> 15:01.100
Get on your belly.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.733
-Man (over radio):
Two, is anyone with him?

15:04.067 --> 15:05.867
-Woman (over radio):
1-22 is with him.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.533
-Man (over radio):
1-22, I'm with him.

15:07.567 --> 15:09.600
-Oh, I can't breathe,
I can't breathe!

15:09.633 --> 15:11.833
I don't now what I did wrong!

15:11.867 --> 15:14.967
-Sir, I want you
to put your hands
behind your back.

15:15.067 --> 15:18.167
There's one more
in the car, but they're--
we're good.

15:18.200 --> 15:23.200
-(moaning)
-Ma'am, with your right hand,
I want you to open up that door.

15:23.233 --> 15:25.067
-Yeah?
-With both hands up,
I want you to go ahead

15:25.100 --> 15:26.767
and step out.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.900
You're fine,
put that stuff on the ground.
-(indistinct yelling)

15:29.933 --> 15:31.067
-Roll over
onto your side, ma'am.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.400
-Aahh...

15:32.433 --> 15:34.433
-Walk backwards
towards me, all right?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.133
-Okay.
-There you go.

15:36.167 --> 15:37.600
-Now just put your hands
behind your back.

15:37.633 --> 15:39.500
-Oh...
-We'll explain everything
in a minute, all right?

15:39.533 --> 15:40.700
-Yeah.

15:40.733 --> 15:43.067
-What's that?
-(indistinct) a friend.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.567
-A friend's car?
Do you live at this house?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.867
-No.
-You don't live here?

15:47.900 --> 15:53.067
Is this your vehicle?
-He said he's from (indistinct),
but I was usin' it.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.067
-You were usin' it?

15:54.067 --> 15:55.367
-We talked to your girlfriend
over here,

15:55.400 --> 15:57.800
she said you got
a bad experience with the police

15:57.833 --> 16:01.333
recently, that's why you're
kinda emotional up there?

16:01.367 --> 16:03.967
-Very emotional.
-All right, well, you're
in a stolen vehicle,

16:04.067 --> 16:05.600
that's why you're
in handcuffs right now,

16:05.633 --> 16:09.500
you understand that?
-No, I d-- I mean, now I--
now I know.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.967
-Pick you up, man.
-All right?

16:11.067 --> 16:12.133
-Ready?
-Can you help us out?

16:12.167 --> 16:15.667
-One, two, three, go.
There you go.
-(moaning)

16:15.700 --> 16:19.533
-What are you howlin' for?
-'Cause I'm usin' somebody
else's pants.

16:19.567 --> 16:21.067
-You're usin' somebody
else's pants?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.433
-Yeah.
I was cold.

16:22.467 --> 16:25.433
-Did they leave somethin'
in their-- their pants?

16:25.467 --> 16:27.633
-Oh-- Popped out.
-Ohhh, oww, ow.

16:27.667 --> 16:29.067
-This is just a one-hitter.

16:29.067 --> 16:30.533
What's your name, sir?
-Taylor.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.500
-Taylor? Okay.
My partner's gonna take you

16:32.533 --> 16:33.533
in the back of his patrol car

16:33.567 --> 16:35.067
so I can talk to you
in a bit, okay?

16:35.067 --> 16:37.733
-Go this way, bud.
-Yeah, he said he got Tased
recently by police.

16:37.767 --> 16:38.933
-Oh, did he?

16:38.967 --> 16:40.767
-I'm gonna
toss the vehicle.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.300
-Uh, I can already see
some drug paraphernalia

16:44.333 --> 16:46.700
located on the seat
where the female was sitting.

16:46.733 --> 16:50.233
Um, we got another pipe
sittin' up on the dashboard.

16:51.533 --> 16:53.733
This right here was underneath
the driver's seat.

16:53.767 --> 16:55.933
Uh, looks like a meth pipe.

16:55.967 --> 17:01.533
Um, we also found a jar
with some-- just a little bit
of marijuana inside.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.867
-If you go in there,
and they find it on you
in there,

17:03.900 --> 17:05.600
that'll be a felony charge.

17:08.767 --> 17:11.233
It's a meth pipe.

17:11.267 --> 17:14.500
All right, if you think
of anything, make sure
you let the officers know.

17:14.533 --> 17:15.567
All right?

17:15.600 --> 17:18.100
-Hey, Crystal.
It's Officer Miller.

17:18.133 --> 17:20.100
You wanna just tell me
what was goin' on?

17:20.133 --> 17:22.567
-Mm, I thought
we was going to get dog food.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.733
-You thought
you were gettin' dog food?
'Kay, how do you know him,

17:24.767 --> 17:26.933
is that your boyfriend
or husband or what?

17:26.967 --> 17:28.733
-Boyfriend.
-Just a boyfriend? Okay.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.700
How long's this guy
been drivin' this truck?

17:30.733 --> 17:33.200
What's-- What's his
story with the truck?

17:33.233 --> 17:37.100
-I-- I don't know.
Our relationship is in
a really difficult...

17:37.133 --> 17:39.433
-My partner told me
they found a pipe
in your bra?

17:39.467 --> 17:43.567
What's that pipe for?
-To use with methamphetamines.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.467
-It's meth? Okay.
Was that your pipe
I found on the passenger seat?

17:46.500 --> 17:49.167
-No.
-No? Were you just
sittin' on it or what?

17:49.200 --> 17:51.633
-Might've been.
-All right, well,
here's the deal.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.133
Tonight, you got
some warrants that
we gotta take care of,

17:54.167 --> 17:56.900
and you just have
a new charge of possession
of drug paraphernalia,

17:56.933 --> 17:59.433
all right?
I'll talk to you in a bit.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.200
Okay, Taylor?
So, you didn't
steal this vehicle?

18:05.233 --> 18:07.867
-No. Not at all.
-Okay. Did you--

18:07.900 --> 18:10.533
-I'm just-- I'm just--
I've had a bad experience.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.667
A very bad experience.
-Okay.

18:12.700 --> 18:16.400
-Um... can you tell me
more about the pipes
and stuff I found

18:16.433 --> 18:19.567
in there?
Do you have, like a,
just a-- little drug addic--

18:19.600 --> 18:20.867
Drug addiction?
-No.

18:20.900 --> 18:21.967
-No?
-No.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.767
-Do you use drugs?
-I-- I have.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.800
-You have?
-I have u-- I have
used before.

18:25.833 --> 18:27.233
-What kind of drugs
have you used?

18:27.267 --> 18:32.600
-I've used, uh, marijuana
and-- and, uh, meth.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.400
-Marijuana and meth?
-Yeah.

18:34.433 --> 18:37.867
-Is that-- Is that marijuana
I found in the truck yours?

18:37.900 --> 18:40.967
There's just a little bit.
-Yeah, it's yours?

18:41.067 --> 18:43.367
How long ago
have you used meth?

18:43.400 --> 18:46.333
-Uh... I tried some
two days ago.

18:46.367 --> 18:49.333
-Two days ago?
Is that pipe I found
below your--

18:49.367 --> 18:52.200
below your seat
your meth pipe?

18:52.233 --> 18:54.400
-No.
-Who's pipe is it?

18:54.433 --> 18:56.833
-I came across it recently.
-You just found it?

18:56.867 --> 18:58.833
Walkin' down the alleyways,
you-- yeah.

18:58.867 --> 19:01.433
-But did you know
it was a meth pipe?
-No.

19:01.467 --> 19:04.067
-What'd you think it was?
-I picked it up and thought
I'd take it home

19:04.067 --> 19:05.500
and just look at it.

19:05.533 --> 19:08.167
-So, you have no clue
that the vehicle was stolen,

19:08.200 --> 19:09.833
you got warrants
that we gotta take care of,

19:09.867 --> 19:12.467
you were drivin'
on a suspended license,

19:12.500 --> 19:14.167
all right?
And you're also gonna
get arrested

19:14.200 --> 19:16.700
for possession
of stolen property,
'cause, uh,

19:16.733 --> 19:18.233
you're in possession
of a stolen vehicle,

19:18.267 --> 19:21.533
possession of marijuana,
and possession of drug
paraphernalia.

19:21.567 --> 19:24.633
-Sounds like a lot of this
comes from drug abuse.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.200
You know?

19:26.233 --> 19:29.100
Sounds like you made
kind of a wrong decision
of borrowin' a vehicle.

19:29.133 --> 19:30.667
-I'm sorry.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.200
-So, let's have a seat
in the car.

19:32.233 --> 19:35.200
These officers
will take care of you,
all right?

19:35.233 --> 19:36.300
We got your truck.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.333
-I can't believe
you found it.
-Yeah?

19:38.367 --> 19:41.233
-You kn-- I-- I was--
I ga-- I gave up
a couple days ago.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.900
-Well, it was drivin'
down the street and...

19:42.933 --> 19:45.233
-I just wanna hug you,
I'm like, thank you for
gettin' my truck back.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.467
-Oh, no problem.
Sometimes it's your lucky day
and you get your stuff back.

19:49.533 --> 19:51.700
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.667
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.700 --> 19:54.833
Cover is code three.

19:54.867 --> 19:58.233
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.367 --> 20:06.500
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:08.633 --> 20:12.500
-(theme music playing)
