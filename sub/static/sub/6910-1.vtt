00:12.679 --> 00:14.313
- Did she find the dog?

00:14.315 --> 00:16.248
- Yeah, I saw her find the dog.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.151
She must have
freaked out, right.

00:19.153 --> 00:22.654
- She started running
around screaming and yelling,

00:22.656 --> 00:23.922
freaking out.

00:23.924 --> 00:27.393
And laid down and started
giving the dog mouth to mouth.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.727
- Disgusting.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.630
Who would do such
a thing like that?

00:31.632 --> 00:34.133
You must have
really hated that dog.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.402
- No, the dog was great.
I loved that dog.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.803
- You loved the dog?

00:37.805 --> 00:40.439
- Then why did you poison it?

00:40.441 --> 00:45.344
- Cruelty to animals is one of
the lowest things you can do.

00:45.346 --> 00:46.645
You're a scumbag.

00:46.647 --> 00:50.516
You asked me for the story,
I'm telling you the story.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.351
- Well I'm sorry I asked.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.520
I hope someone poisons you, Ted.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.588
I really do.

00:58.691 --> 01:00.159
I think about the human race.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.795
I think about the
end of the world.

01:04.431 --> 01:06.432
I wonder about it.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.567
Are we worth saving?

01:08.569 --> 01:12.137
What kind of person poisons
his ex-girlfriend's dog

01:12.139 --> 01:15.140
to get revenge?

01:15.142 --> 01:17.843
How can you forgive someone
for something like that?

01:17.845 --> 01:21.213
Can you forgive them?
I don't know.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.848
It's hard to have faith
in the human race

01:22.850 --> 01:26.351
when there are people
like Ted walking the earth.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.457
You're listening to
Stevie bricks show

01:31.459 --> 01:33.592
and this is Stevie bricks

01:33.594 --> 01:35.561
and I thank you if you're
tuning in tonight.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.529
It's tell-all Tuesday

01:37.531 --> 01:43.202
and I want to know the worst
thing you've ever done.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.404
Maybe you're a
high school teacher

01:45.406 --> 01:47.573
and you've had sex
with a student.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.608
Maybe you're an ex-Nazi

01:49.610 --> 01:52.344
and you worked in a
concentration camp.

01:52.346 --> 01:58.350
Or maybe you worked at
the world bank or tmz.

01:58.352 --> 02:03.355
Whatever it is, this is a chance
for you to tell your story.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.891
Ron from New York,
you're on the air.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.659
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

02:07.661 --> 02:09.394
- I can't believe I'm
talking to Stevie bricks.

02:09.395 --> 02:11.230
- Man, I love your show.
- Thanks.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.364
- I listen to you
all the time, man.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.233
- All the time.
- Ron, you flatter me.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.802
- What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

02:16.804 --> 02:19.471
- Well, I've never
told anyone this story.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.241
- Okay, well let's hear it.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.643
- It was a long time ago.
It was in college, actually.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.545
- Mm-hmm.
What happened?

02:26.547 --> 02:28.514
Did you take advantage
of someone?

02:28.516 --> 02:29.648
- No, like a girl?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.183
I would never do
anything like that.

02:31.185 --> 02:35.754
- Well, what did you do, Ron?

02:35.756 --> 02:38.390
Hmm?

02:38.392 --> 02:41.927
- I'm sorry, man.
I'm just nervous.

02:41.929 --> 02:45.364
I've been carrying this story
with me for a long time.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.633
Tonight's the night i
finally share it with the world.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.635
Here it goes,

02:49.637 --> 02:51.336
the worst thing I've ever done.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.805
- I cut off a man's--
- Ron, we got to go.
We're late.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.808
- Who are you talking to?
- It doesn't matter.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.877
- Honey, we got to go.
We're already late.
- It's okay.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.779
- Ron, you there?

03:00.781 --> 03:02.748
- Yeah, we are just
dealing with something.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.850
I'm dealing with my wife
actually, so it's fine.

03:04.852 --> 03:08.754
- Who is it?
Who are you talking to?
- It doesn't matter.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.222
- I just don't want
to lose the table

03:10.224 --> 03:11.690
because we all have to
sit at the same time.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.359
- Okay, it looks like Ron is
in the middle of some sort of

03:14.361 --> 03:15.494
domestic dispute.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.896
- We can't sit down
until all of us are there.

03:17.898 --> 03:21.867
- Ron, this is live radio.
I don't have a second.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.468
- No, no it's fine.
It's all taken care of,

03:23.470 --> 03:25.270
because I'm going to tell
you the story right now.

03:25.272 --> 03:26.538
- I'll give you 30 seconds.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.440
- Uh-huh.
Some other time, Ron.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.741
- Hello?
- 29, 28

03:29.743 --> 03:33.478
- hello?
- 27, 26...

03:33.480 --> 03:34.680
- He hung up.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.315
- Who were you talking to?

03:36.317 --> 03:38.217
- Stevie bricks.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.586
- Stevie bricks, the radio guy?

03:40.588 --> 03:43.989
- Ron, he's totally obnoxious.
Come on, let's go.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.524
- How are you
already ready to go?

03:45.526 --> 03:47.793
You take forever to get ready.

03:48.861 --> 03:50.996
- Are you really
wearing that shirt?

03:50.998 --> 03:52.965
- What's wrong with this shirt?

03:52.967 --> 03:55.367
- You look like a
Mexican Ken doll.

03:55.369 --> 03:59.638
- I'm not a 12-year-old, okay.
I can listen to whatever I want.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.406
Besides, I don't give you a
hard time about watching that

04:01.408 --> 04:03.742
prison show you love so much.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.711
- Yeah,
but why would you call in?

04:05.713 --> 04:07.479
- Can you slow down
a little bit?

04:07.481 --> 04:08.847
- Ron, no.
We're running late.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.616
- You're power walking
it feels like

04:10.618 --> 04:12.918
- and my feet are hurting.
- I'm not power walking.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.686
- Seriously,
just slow down a little bit.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.755
- You know what,
you really need to get in shape.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.923
A lot of fat around
the mid-section

04:17.925 --> 04:18.824
is a sign of heart disease.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.959
- I'm fine, okay.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.828
- You know what my mom wants
to get you for Christmas?

04:22.830 --> 04:25.364
- What?
- A defibrillator.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.368
- Get Pesto,
you can get anything you want.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.902
- We can share something.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.504
- Okay, all right.

04:32.506 --> 04:37.743
Isn't my wife the most beautiful
thing you've ever seen?

04:37.745 --> 04:39.411
- She really is.
- Really.

04:39.413 --> 04:43.048
- You like to make me blush.
- Gorgeous.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.916
- Nicki, you look
beautiful as well.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.619
- Oh, thank you.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.054
- Ron, doesn't Nicki
look beautiful tonight?

04:49.056 --> 04:51.923
I don't need confirmation
that she's looks beautiful.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.959
I know she's beautiful.
You look beautiful too.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.927
Everybody here
looks really great.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.730
Now can you guys just stop
doing what you're doing

04:58.732 --> 05:02.801
because I don't even want
to eat dinner because...

05:02.803 --> 05:04.803
- Ron's not one to
give complements much.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.573
Actually he doesn't
really say I love you.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.542
- Well, sometimes.
- What's the matter with you?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.978
- I just don't feel like you
have to say it all the time.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.714
You know, before you go to bed,
before you go to work,

05:15.716 --> 05:17.516
before you go to the bathroom.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.518
There's something about it
that reeks of desperation.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.486
Constantly, "i love you,
i love you,

05:21.488 --> 05:25.957
- I'm not questioning
your love for each other.
- I love you.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.492
- I'm just saying there's
something about it

05:27.494 --> 05:29.695
that's slightly
pathetically sad.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.463
And desperate.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.699
- You should try it.
You should try it, Ron.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.634
- It feels good.
- Yeah, it just feels good.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.703
I don't have to tell her
she's beautiful

05:37.705 --> 05:39.638
to confirm that I love her.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.075
- It's just a reminder that you
can give love and receive love

05:43.077 --> 05:45.711
and it just feels so good
inside when you say it.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.747
- We give and receive love
once a month, at least.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.816
- It's nice to hear sometimes.

05:50.818 --> 05:51.983
I'm just letting you know that.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.485
I'm fine,
it's nice to hear sometimes.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.753
- Listen to your woman.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.088
- How are we doing
over here, guys?

05:56.090 --> 05:57.556
- Good, good.
- Great!

05:57.558 --> 05:58.924
- Are you ready to order?
- Yeah!

05:58.926 --> 06:00.492
- You got any questions
about the menu?

06:00.494 --> 06:01.827
- Um.
- Um.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.763
- I know what I want,
spaghetti and meatballs.

06:04.997 --> 06:07.599
- I think it was based
on her biography.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.601
- Yeah, she went to prison
for like a year and a half

06:09.603 --> 06:10.702
for embezzlement or something.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.905
- I wonder if she regrets it.
- I can't imagine she would.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.508
She got a biography
and a hit TV show out of it.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.043
It's the best thing
that ever happened to her.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.412
- I don't know if I'd trade
18 months of my life

06:20.414 --> 06:22.948
for a career in
film and television.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.816
- Well, she probably saw
it as an opportunity

06:24.818 --> 06:27.853
to capitalize off of a
unique life experience.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.488
- I can't believe we're
sitting around talking about

06:29.490 --> 06:31.123
a television show
about women in prison.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.991
We're all adults, we should
be talking about something

06:32.993 --> 06:36.428
sophisticated, like literature,
or books or something like that.

06:36.430 --> 06:40.599
- This is a worthy conversation.
It's culture.
- Yeah.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.967
- But I'm just sick of hearing

06:41.969 --> 06:45.137
that we're in the golden
age of television, okay.

06:45.139 --> 06:46.838
It's still just a
big distraction.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.141
It doesn't compare to reading.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.909
- This coming from the
man who listens to

06:50.911 --> 06:52.611
the Stevie bricks show.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.079
- Who listens to Stevie bricks?
- What?

06:54.081 --> 06:55.447
- This fucking guy does.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.615
- No.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.883
- He's the worst.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.618
- You listen to Stevie bricks?

06:59.620 --> 07:03.088
- Hey, look at it this way.
If it wasn't for sexist people,

07:03.090 --> 07:04.756
feminism wouldn't have a cause.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.627
- Actually, tonight he was
calling into the show.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.728
That's why we were late.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.963
- It's the first time
i called in.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.899
- You're as low-brow
as they get.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.934
- Stevie bricks
is not low-brow, okay.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.502
He's an anthropologist.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.839
- He has people call in
to break wind on air.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.207
Did you call in to do that?

07:22.209 --> 07:25.577
- I would never air
my air on air.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.713
- Why did you call?
- He doesn't do that
anymore, by the way.

07:28.715 --> 07:33.018
- So, why did you call in?
- Yeah, why did you call in?

07:33.020 --> 07:36.188
- All right, once a week
he has this segment

07:36.190 --> 07:38.089
called tell-all Tuesday,

07:38.091 --> 07:41.927
where callers call in
and they tell a story.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.895
They tell the worst thing
they've ever done.

07:43.897 --> 07:47.766
To talk about the worst
thing I've ever done.

07:47.768 --> 07:52.604
- Yeah, what's the worst
thing you've ever done?
- I don't want to talk about it.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.906
- You were going to
tell all of New York.
- Yeah.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.575
- The moment is gone though.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.210
- No, no, no,
the moment's not gone.

07:58.212 --> 07:59.611
The moment is now.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.947
- Tell us.
Do you know this story?

08:01.949 --> 08:04.449
I mean, he's done some
really shitty things,

08:04.451 --> 08:07.686
so I would love to know
what the worst thing is.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.521
- Tell us.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.156
- I cut a guy's fingers off.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.624
- What?
- Bullshit.

08:12.626 --> 08:13.892
- No, it's true. I did.
- Bullshit.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.928
- I was at a frat party
in college,

08:16.930 --> 08:19.130
partying and drinking.

08:19.132 --> 08:22.968
So, I was waiting in line
to go to the bathroom.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.836
There's a girl standing there,
she's cute

08:24.838 --> 08:26.838
and I start talking to her.
I start flirting.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.208
Because I've had a few drinks
and got a lot of bravado.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.844
I'm very charming, you know,
when I'm drunk.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.712
So we're talking,
having a good time,

08:34.715 --> 08:35.947
we're laughing.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.883
This is all in the span
of a few minutes.

08:37.885 --> 08:41.285
Then, out of the blue, this big
dude comes out of the bathroom

08:41.288 --> 08:42.854
and he sees me
talking to this girl.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.289
Obviously it's his girlfriend.

08:44.291 --> 08:48.727
And he says, "what the fuck are
you doing talking to my girl?"

08:48.729 --> 08:50.862
- It's his girlfriend?
- Apparently,
it's his girlfriend.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.130
- What were you saying to her?

08:52.132 --> 08:53.865
- Nothing, I don't remember.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.767
- People get jealous,
you know...College guys.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.636
- I'm just flirting with her
like people do at parties.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.738
It was a long time ago.
I was drunk and stoned.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.907
I wasn't saying anything
crude or untoward.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.709
He's throttling you
and then what?

09:04.711 --> 09:08.079
- He's smacking you
around like a little bitch.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.314
- No, he's not slapping me
around like a little bitch,

09:09.316 --> 09:10.682
but he's pushing me
up against the wall

09:10.684 --> 09:11.850
and he's screaming at me.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.885
- He's actually assaulting me.
- Right.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.154
- So, I don't take shit
like that from anybody.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.156
I may be a small guy,
but if people fuck with me,

09:18.158 --> 09:20.859
I'll fuck shit up
if I get provoked.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.194
- Okay, just tell us the story.
- Anyway, Rambo.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.263
- So I just react

09:25.265 --> 09:29.167
and I just shove the guy
as hard as I can

09:29.169 --> 09:32.237
I wrestled in high school.
I'm a strong motherfucker.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.805
I can get people
off balance, right.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.041
So the guy's on the floor,
and he's writhing around

09:36.043 --> 09:40.045
and he stands up and
he's really pissed off now,

09:40.047 --> 09:43.148
- because I've humiliated him
in front of all these people.
- Good, good.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.150
- He deserved it, right?
- Yeah, he deserved it.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.885
- I hate punks like that.
- I do too,

09:46.887 --> 09:51.623
- but, at the same time,
he stands up and he's
really pissed off now.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.125
So I'm a little scared,
not because I'm a pussy,

09:54.127 --> 09:56.194
but this is seriously
some fucked up shit.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.996
So, he starts coming after me

09:57.998 --> 10:01.800
and he charges me
with his hands out like this

10:01.802 --> 10:04.336
and my fight or flight
response takes hold.

10:04.338 --> 10:07.672
So I just slam the
bathroom door and I run.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.207
I just run like hell.

10:09.209 --> 10:12.644
But the thing is, this
bathroom door is really heavy.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.846
It's like one of these big
industrial bathroom doors,

10:14.848 --> 10:17.182
so when it slams,
and I slam it shut,

10:17.184 --> 10:19.751
it slams really hard.
It's like "wham!"

10:19.753 --> 10:21.820
You know, really, really hard.

10:21.822 --> 10:25.190
And I start running but then
i hear all this screaming

10:25.192 --> 10:26.825
and yelling, like,
"oh my god!"

10:26.827 --> 10:29.027
It's complete pandemonium.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.831
And I look up and this frat
guy is back on me again

10:32.833 --> 10:34.699
and he's like,
"look what you did to me!

10:34.701 --> 10:36.668
Look what you did to me,
mother fucker!"

10:36.670 --> 10:39.104
- And there's blood everywhere.
- Oh my god.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.806
Again, I'm a little stone
and inebriated.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.074
But I'll never forget this.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.976
There's blood all over
my sweater,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.344
blood all over the walls.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.813
He says,
"look what you did to me!"

10:48.815 --> 10:50.115
And I look up

10:50.117 --> 10:52.717
and two of his fingers
are missing.

10:52.719 --> 10:56.187
They're cut off and there's
blood just gushing everywhere.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.189
Again, this is a frenzy.
It's out of control.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.858
- It's complete bedlam.
- I can't believe you
didn't tell me this.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.128
- The door cut his
fucking fingers off.
- Really?

11:03.130 --> 11:06.297
- Is it a heavy, heavy door?
It could have done that?

11:06.299 --> 11:08.967
- It wasn't like they were
dangling or mangled.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.302
- They were clean cut.
- Off? Off?

11:11.304 --> 11:13.304
- Off.
- And then what happened?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.006
- So everybody's freaking out.

11:15.008 --> 11:19.144
The guy's freaking out.
And I just run, I run like hell.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.413
I run out of the frat house.
I run across campus.

11:21.415 --> 11:25.383
And I pretty much hide in the
dorm room until the next day.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.285
- Did you get into trouble?

11:27.287 --> 11:29.788
- They didn't have
cell phones back then

11:29.790 --> 11:31.022
so no one took a photo.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.390
- No one saw you.
No one fingered you?

11:32.392 --> 11:35.293
- People saw me, but they
didn't know who we were.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.195
We used to go to these frat
parties, my friend and I.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.930
We would bounce
around frat court.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.132
We would go from one
frat party to next frat party,

11:41.134 --> 11:43.268
- drinking their beer,
fucking their women.
- Right, sure.

11:43.270 --> 11:48.873
- That's the way you do,
or the way one does.
- You guys...

11:48.875 --> 11:51.109
- Anyway, that's the
worst thing I ever did.

11:51.111 --> 11:54.846
- Did you ever wonder
whatever happened to that guy?

11:54.848 --> 11:57.449
- I wouldn't know that guy
if I saw him today.

11:57.451 --> 11:59.350
- You don't think that's
hanging over your head.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.720
The guy's somewhere
standing nearby.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.389
- It could be this guy right
here and I wouldn't even know.
You know?

12:04.391 --> 12:05.924
- How are you guys doing?

12:05.926 --> 12:08.460
- Good.
- Good, a little nauseated.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.261
- Anybody want dessert?

12:10.263 --> 12:12.430
- Yes, I'll have the tiramisu.
- No!

12:12.432 --> 12:14.933
- Oh, this is so good.
- Why didn't you guys
just get your own?

12:14.935 --> 12:17.068
- I just wanted a bite.
- We could have gotten extra.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.739
- Take your time,
whenever you guys are ready.
- Thank you.

12:20.741 --> 12:21.806
- Thank you.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.208
- No, no we got this.
- Yeah.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.075
- This is our turn.
- Are you sure?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.343
- You guys paid last time.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.511
- Did we?
- Yeah.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.413
- Yeah,
it's definitely our turn.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.215
- I mean, this place is more
expensive than the last place,

12:30.217 --> 12:31.750
but that's fine.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.926
- Goodnight, babe.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.833
Oh sweetheart,
I'm really stuffed.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.136
That food was so rich.

12:55.007 --> 12:58.943
- You want to fool
around a little bit?

12:58.945 --> 13:02.013
- I'm really tired, honey.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.949
I had a fucking long day.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.885
- Fine.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.289
- Hey.
- Yeah.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.390
- I love you.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.392
- I love you too.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.070
- Les?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.405
- Huh?

13:27.407 --> 13:30.542
- What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

13:35.848 --> 13:38.516
- I need to tell you something.
- Huh, what?

13:38.518 --> 13:40.285
- I love you.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.488
- Huh?
- I love you.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.124
- Hey look at me for a second.
- What?

13:46.126 --> 13:48.493
- I love you.
- I know.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.296
- No, I mean, I really,
really love you.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.933
You're the most beautiful
women I've ever seen in my life.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.269
If I believed in god,
i would thank him or her,

13:58.271 --> 14:02.907
everyday, that he made you
just stupid enough to marry me.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.175
- Thanks.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.411
- Thank you for
making her so stupid.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.046
I don't know what i
would do without you.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.414
- You're very sweet.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.050
- We should make a baby.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.585
- No.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.987
- What the fuck.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.622
- That's the most disgusting
thing I've ever heard

14:17.624 --> 14:18.923
in my entire life.

14:18.925 --> 14:21.159
- You asked me
and I told you.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.428
Why the fuck did you ask me
if you didn't want to hear it.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.430
- You peed on a puppy?

14:25.432 --> 14:26.931
An innocent puppy?

14:26.933 --> 14:28.199
- It was in fucking high school.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.467
It was ages ago.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.337
You're with your punk ass
high school friends

14:32.339 --> 14:35.073
and you're walking in the woods
and you see a stray puppy,

14:35.075 --> 14:39.010
so you pull out your cocks
and you piss all over it?

14:39.012 --> 14:41.012
- That's what you did?
- I'm not proud of it.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.013
- I'm going to be sick.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.414
- Why are you getting so upset?

14:43.416 --> 14:45.350
You're acting like we
ripped it open and ate it.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.085
- I just wish you never
would have told me.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.553
I can't handle things like this.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.288
You know I obsess over things.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.957
- Fine, can we start over now?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.392
The worst thing I ever did?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.494
I stole a pair of
running shoes, okay.

14:56.496 --> 15:00.298
- What was it doing when you
were pissing all over it?

15:02.602 --> 15:05.904
It would run one way,
i would spray it with pee.

15:05.906 --> 15:11.142
- I'm going to be sick.
I'm going to be so sick.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.111
- You know, when we first met
and we were experimenting,

15:13.113 --> 15:14.946
we use to give each
other golden showers,

15:14.948 --> 15:15.680
remember that?

15:15.682 --> 15:17.415
- That was consensual.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.050
- Okay, the next time
i pee on a puppy,

15:19.052 --> 15:20.652
I'll get his consent,
all right.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.020
- When I was in college,

15:22.022 --> 15:23.554
I used to be an
animal rights activist.

15:23.556 --> 15:27.358
I use to throw buckets of paint
on people who wore fur coats.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.460
- That's a fantastic way
to solve a problem,

15:29.462 --> 15:31.129
just throw a
bucket of paint on it.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.530
Who thought of that?
It's genius.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.265
- Its better than
a bucket of piss.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.268
- Fine, shut the light.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.238
- You need to make amends.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.941
- I'll make a donation
to the humane society.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.609
- That could work.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.681
- Like, five thousand dollars.
- Fine.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.449
- That's five thousand less
than we'll have to spend

15:51.451 --> 15:53.685
on shit we like.

15:53.687 --> 15:55.954
- Like, five hundred dollars.
- Done.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.056
- Shut the light.

16:04.563 --> 16:07.265
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

16:11.304 --> 16:14.605
Does anybody recognize
what I'm drawing?

16:14.607 --> 16:16.274
- Twin towers?

16:16.276 --> 16:17.675
- Twin towers.
That's exactly right.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.979
And we all know what
happened to the twin towers.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.181
September 11th 2001,

16:23.183 --> 16:28.553
they were reduced to a big
heap of smoldering rubble, okay.

16:28.555 --> 16:32.323
We went to war with Afghanistan
and we went to war with Iraq

16:32.325 --> 16:37.428
and now Iraq is completely
discombobulated and in pieces.

16:37.430 --> 16:42.033
So, what I want to know is,
instead of going to war,

16:42.035 --> 16:45.436
what are some alternatives
to going to war?

16:45.438 --> 16:48.473
What are some things we could
have done besides going to war?

16:48.475 --> 16:51.242
So, Cameron, let's say
that I walk up to you.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.510
You're in the hallway
and I just punch you.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.413
I just punch you.
I punch you in the shoulder.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.415
Okay, what are you going to do?

16:57.417 --> 16:59.584
- I'm probably going
to punch you back!

16:59.586 --> 17:02.086
- Well, yeah.
That's right, you know.

17:02.088 --> 17:06.223
And I would understand that,

17:06.226 --> 17:09.292
and that's exactly the way
we acted after 9/11.

17:09.295 --> 17:12.530
We were all very angry,
we wanted revenge.

17:12.531 --> 17:17.035
We were also very scared,
so we reacted with force, okay.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.303
But there wasn't a
lot of compassion.

17:19.305 --> 17:24.142
There was compassion for
the people we lost on 9/11.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.778
There was compassion
for the families,

17:26.780 --> 17:28.146
but there wasn't so
much compassion

17:28.147 --> 17:29.380
for the people we bombed.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.050
Rain, can you put your
cell phone away, please?

17:32.052 --> 17:33.584
So what are some alternatives?

17:33.586 --> 17:37.655
What are some things
we could do besides

17:37.657 --> 17:39.690
punch back, basically.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.426
- You could talk.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.461
- That's good, Kimberly.
We could talk.

17:43.463 --> 17:49.667
Someone punches you,
you could ask a question,

17:49.669 --> 17:50.802
for example.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.337
Ask me why I punched you,
Cameron.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.773
I just punched you in the face.
Ask me a question.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.809
Rain.
Come on, man.

17:57.811 --> 18:00.445
Put the cell phone away,
seriously.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.647
You're cramping my
whole style here, okay.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.149
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

18:05.151 --> 18:07.085
- Give it to me.
- No.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.553
- What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

18:08.555 --> 18:09.854
- This is so stupid.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.422
- Why is this stupid?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.424
- Do you realize
what you're saying?

18:13.426 --> 18:15.126
You're saying that the
terrorists were justified

18:15.128 --> 18:16.394
in what they did.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.196
- No, I'm not saying that.
- Yeah, you are.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.331
- I'm trying to get you all
to learn empathy,

18:20.333 --> 18:22.300
which is something
this me generation of me,

18:22.302 --> 18:24.836
- me, me, doesn't have.
- Empathy?

18:24.838 --> 18:26.304
Why should I be
listening to you?

18:26.306 --> 18:29.173
It's adults that start the wars?

18:30.309 --> 18:32.710
- I had to push a lot strings to
get this through the curriculum.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.479
But, I'm glad you guys
are appreciating it.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.614
You guys have a good day,
take care.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.555
Jesus Christ.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.590
Les?
What are you doing, man?

18:45.592 --> 18:47.525
- I should fuck you up
right now.

18:47.527 --> 18:52.697
- Kate told me about your little
finger bang party last year.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.298
I didn't think you
were the kind of guy

18:54.300 --> 18:56.667
to fuck around with
another man's wife.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.304
- Is everything okay?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.373
- Yeah Zane, it's cool.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.443
- Yeah. It's fine.
He's fine, thanks. It's cool.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.577
You can go back
to your friends.

19:06.579 --> 19:10.181
- This is where I work, man.
Don't do this shit, okay.

19:10.183 --> 19:13.784
We were fucking wasted.
It didn't mean anything.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.820
- Oh, is that an excuse?
Does that make it okay?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.788
You were wasted?

19:19.459 --> 19:23.561
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm contemplating
kicking your ass,

19:23.563 --> 19:26.564
but I don't want
to get in trouble.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.865
You hit somebody in the
temple hard enough

19:27.867 --> 19:29.333
you can kill them instantly.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.335
I don't need a manslaughter
conviction.

19:31.337 --> 19:35.173
- Nobody needs a manslaughter
conviction.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.707
- Why did she tell you?

19:36.709 --> 19:38.176
- I have no idea
why she told me.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.477
I would rather I didn't know.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.345
- It was innocent.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.881
You know where I come from
stinky pinky isn't innocent.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.283
It's second base.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.618
- Stinky pinky?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.253
- Did you fuck her?

19:49.255 --> 19:51.622
- No, man.
We made out in a bathroom.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.823
It was like two years ago.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.325
I barely remember it, man.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.861
I was plastered.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.865
You're not going to
tell Nicki, are you?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.833
- No, but you should.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.202
- I'm not going to.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.536
- Yeah, I'm not surprised.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.371
You always seemed
like a coward to me.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.240
- I'm not a coward, man.
I use to live in bedstuy.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.808
- You don't see Kate anymore,
you understand.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.778
You don't talk to her,
you don't even dream about her.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.580
- I can't control
what I dream about.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.782
I had a dream last night i
was 69-ing Donald rumsfeld.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.251
- Listen to me.
I know gangsters, right.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.352
Real ones.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.920
Sicilians and shit.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.922
You may have cut a guy's
fingers off by accident

20:24.924 --> 20:27.858
but I know people who do that
for a living, okay?

20:27.860 --> 20:30.995
You just watch your back,
motherfucker.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.731
- I wash my back every night.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.233
- Watch!

20:35.235 --> 20:37.868
Watch, motherfucker!

20:40.939 --> 20:43.407
- Fuck.

20:45.777 --> 20:49.280
- Now, my first marriage
was a disaster.

20:49.282 --> 20:53.884
My second marriage
was not much better.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.989
My third was okay...

20:58.590 --> 20:59.957
...but far from perfect.

20:59.959 --> 21:05.696
I'm not a Saint, I'll admit it,
but we all have needs.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.532
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.867
- ...food and shelter...

21:09.869 --> 21:11.636
- You're listening
to Stevie bricks.
- Yeah.

21:11.638 --> 21:16.741
- I'm just trying to figure out
what you see in this guy.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.342
- What are they talking about?

21:18.344 --> 21:21.012
- Adultery.

21:21.014 --> 21:22.513
- Did you talk to les?

21:22.515 --> 21:23.581
- Huh? No.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.549
- Turn this off.
This guy's an idiot.

21:25.551 --> 21:26.651
- Oh, now he's an idiot?

21:26.653 --> 21:27.752
I thought you
worshipped the guy.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.854
- You hungry?
- I guess.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.322
- Let's get some Chinese food.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.757
- Okay.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.333
- Les.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.934
- Yes.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.871
- Are you going to talk to me?

21:46.873 --> 21:48.739
- I'm eating.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.908
- So?

21:51.443 --> 21:54.478
- I don't like talking
with my mouth full.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.448
- Well, talk to me when
your mouth is empty.

22:03.488 --> 22:06.090
- I don't feel like
talking tonight.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.460
- Les, I'm sorry.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.729
- What are you sorry about?

22:11.731 --> 22:14.098
It was just a finger, right?

22:14.100 --> 22:16.834
Just one finger.

22:17.803 --> 22:19.970
What's the big deal?

22:21.506 --> 22:23.007
- Felix, how are you?
- Hey, hood to see you.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.376
- Good to see you too.
How are things?

22:25.378 --> 22:27.011
- Good, everything's fine.
- How's your family?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.779
- Family's good, too.
- Good?

22:28.781 --> 22:30.548
- There you go, keep the change.
- Thank you.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.716
- Keep the change.
- Oh, thank you.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.752
- Business is better than ever.
- Better than ever?

22:34.754 --> 22:36.587
- In this economy,
the way this economy is,

22:36.589 --> 22:40.358
- nothing's...
You know, that's great.
- Yeah, nothing is affecting us.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.792
- That's what happens when
you sell a good product

22:41.794 --> 22:43.894
- at a good price.
- Oh, thank you.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.096
- That's probably the reason why

22:45.098 --> 22:46.997
- no one goes to
the movies anymore.
- Right, right!

22:46.999 --> 22:48.666
- Well, thanks very much.
- Thank you so much.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.501
- You're a good customer.
- Thanks very much.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.002
- Take care.

22:53.773 --> 22:56.807
- You really want to
watch "life in orange?"

22:56.809 --> 22:59.543
- Yeah, I want to find out
what the masses are watching.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.913
- Wow, join the herd.
You make it sound so dumb.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.949
- Well, this is the
new normalcy...

23:04.951 --> 23:07.418
The new normality I should say.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.787
Each episode is tuning us out
just a little bit more.

23:09.789 --> 23:12.056
It's what aldous huxley
talked about in brave new world.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.959
- It's also what
Neil postman wrote about.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.727
- I don't know who that is.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.095
- It doesn't matter if
we're getting dumber,

23:18.097 --> 23:20.030
because the singularity
will fix everything.

23:20.032 --> 23:23.067
- Ron, I don't care.
I just want to watch the show.
- Okay.

23:25.103 --> 23:27.905
Is there full frontal in this?

23:34.679 --> 23:37.481
- Les, you're going to be late.

23:40.185 --> 23:43.487
Can I make you breakfast?

23:57.703 --> 24:00.805
- Okay, so operation ajax!

24:00.807 --> 24:02.873
- Isn't that a soap?

24:02.875 --> 24:05.042
- Yeah well, it is a soap, yes.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.744
But in terms of
what happened here,

24:06.746 --> 24:08.512
I wouldn't say there
was anything clean

24:08.514 --> 24:10.614
about what America did, okay.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.716
But if you consider
what we did,

24:12.718 --> 24:14.618
which was pretty lousy,

24:14.620 --> 24:17.154
let's imagine a hypothetical
where it didn't happen.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.857
And we didn't go in and get rid
of the prime minister of Iran

24:19.859 --> 24:21.058
in the 1950s.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.560
How might that have
that affected

24:22.562 --> 24:24.028
middle eastern relations today?

24:24.030 --> 24:26.030
How might the middle east
view us today,

24:26.032 --> 24:29.667
- well, it was in our best
interest to do it though,

24:29.669 --> 24:30.768
wasn't it?

24:30.770 --> 24:35.039
Economically, it was in our
best interest to take their oil.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.141
All Iran wanted to do
was nationalize their oil,

24:37.143 --> 24:38.642
so what was in
their best interest?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.110
That's what people
don't talk about.

Let's say you got a million
dollars under your bed, okay.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.949
It's in my best interest

24:44.951 --> 24:47.618
to take that million dollars
if I want it,

24:47.620 --> 24:48.953
because I can do a
lot with that money.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.521

your best interest.

Empathy matters, okay.

One of your mafia connections?

to the sicilian mafia family.

29:52.390 --> 29:55.092
- Let's go.
Come on.

29:55.094 --> 29:58.028
Gioia, come on!
We need to go!

29:58.363 --> 29:59.963
- Maybe you're doing
something to provoke her.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.465
You know she can
be very sensitive.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.167
- I'm just doing my job, okay.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.969
Rain's behavior is
becoming more anti-social.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.138
It's interfering with class.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.940
- Mrs. Bennet, is anything
happening at home

30:09.942 --> 30:12.309
that might be
causing rain distress?

30:12.311 --> 30:14.144
- Well, her grandfather
is very sick

30:14.146 --> 30:18.515
- oh, that's sad to hear.
- Diabetes is a serious illness.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.184
They had to amputate one
of his legs below the knee.

30:20.186 --> 30:22.085
They may have to
amputate the other leg soon.

30:22.087 --> 30:24.121
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, that's awful.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.156
- But this doesn't give
cause for her to act out

30:26.158 --> 30:27.558
the way you say
that she is.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.260
Normally, she's very
respectful towards authority.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.996
- Yeah, but she's
extremely hostile to me.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.998
- Maybe she's defending herself.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.533
- No.
She's antagonistic.

30:36.535 --> 30:37.534
She's aggressive.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.002
It's completely unprovoked.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.437
- Well, her father was
from the middle east

30:40.439 --> 30:42.339
and her father was
very emotionally abusive.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.607
- So, he's no longer
in the picture?

30:43.609 --> 30:45.576
- No. He sells shish kabobs
in sabzevar.

30:45.578 --> 30:47.077
- Just because he was
emotionally abusive,

30:47.079 --> 30:48.245
doesn't mean that all
middle eastern men

30:48.247 --> 30:51.448
- just because all middle
eastern men aren't abusive

30:51.450 --> 30:53.984
doesn't mean that you're not.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.920
- You can't blame everything
on the middle east.

30:56.922 --> 31:00.023
- I agree with Ron.
And besides, Ron's American.

31:00.025 --> 31:02.159
- Yeah, but my family
is from Turkey.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.994
- And they have very
backwards policies

31:03.996 --> 31:05.596
towards their women there.

31:05.598 --> 31:09.433
Turkey has a very western
attitude towards women.

31:09.435 --> 31:12.903
They expect for their
women to be obsequious there.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.471
- Turkish women, obsequious?
- Yeah.

31:14.473 --> 31:18.442
- No. If anything turkish
women are bossy and bitchy.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.310
- Bossy and bitchy?

31:20.312 --> 31:21.578
- I don't mean it like that.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.213
- Do you see what I mean?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.381
- Strong.
Turkish women are very strong.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.649
- No, you're trying
to cover it up.

31:25.651 --> 31:26.917
- I'm mainly referring
to my mother.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.318
My mother was bossy
and bitchy.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.387
- She still is.
- Ron, Ron, Ron, chill.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.989
- I can't be in the room
with this man.

31:31.991 --> 31:33.190
- Mrs. Bennet,
Mrs. Bennet, listen.

31:33.192 --> 31:36.026
We care greatly
about rain's education.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.327
We feel she's a
very bright girl.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.029
- She's absolutely
a bright girl.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.130
I don't like him.

31:40.132 --> 31:44.401
I don't like him either,
but that's another story.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.503
So how long has rain's
father been out of the picture?

31:46.505 --> 31:49.539
- I became a teacher so
i could make a difference,

31:49.541 --> 31:52.442
to feel good about my life.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.912
But I just feel like I'm
not reaching these kids.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.547
I think it's the parents
to blame to be honest.

31:57.549 --> 32:01.985
I mean, I really just think
that my students hate me.

32:01.987 --> 32:04.187
- I hated all my teachers
in high school.

32:04.189 --> 32:05.355
- You did?
- Yeah.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.556
- Even the ones you fucked?

32:06.558 --> 32:08.659
- Especially the ones I fucked.
- Really?

32:08.661 --> 32:10.427
- Yeah.
- Did you fuck a lot of them?

32:10.429 --> 32:16.333
- Oh yeah, actually, this shirt.
But can you wash it on cold?

32:16.335 --> 32:18.135
Just wash all of it on cold.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.270
- Wash it on hot.
Got it. I got it.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.205
You need anything else?

32:22.207 --> 32:23.507
- Um... I don't think so.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.342
- Anything dirty?
Your panties?

32:25.344 --> 32:27.611
Are they a little crusty?
Are they a little dirty?

32:27.613 --> 32:32.215
Can I take your panties and
give those a nice washing?

32:32.217 --> 32:34.184
- You want my dirty panties?
- I like your dirty panties.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.353
I like your nice,
crusty panties.

32:36.355 --> 32:37.955
That's the best
thing in the world.

32:37.957 --> 32:40.557
There's nothing like
a nice pile of yeast

32:40.559 --> 32:42.092
to get me through the day.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.694
- You're disgusting.

32:45.230 --> 32:48.065
- This would stop a war,
you know what I mean.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.633
Instead of napalm, they
should've just shower

32:49.635 --> 32:51.034

with your...

32:51.036 --> 32:52.369
Do you want to fool
around before I go?

32:52.371 --> 32:54.004
- No.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.238
- Are you having an outbreak?

32:55.240 --> 32:57.441
- No.

32:57.443 --> 33:00.277
- It's nothing to be
embarrassed about or ashamed of.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.612
- Whatever.
You gave it to me.

33:02.614 --> 33:06.049
- I do know that 100 percent.
I know that 100,000 percent.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.351
- You were promiscuous
in college.

33:07.353 --> 33:09.653
You didn't always
use protection.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.122
- It was awesome in college.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.590
- See you later.
I love you.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.226

that a lot lately.

I've just been feeling amorous.

33:18.731 --> 33:20.397
You know?
So what?

It's like you're compensating
for something.

33:24.403 --> 33:27.004

I love you, okay?

33:27.006 --> 33:28.438
You're my wife and i

40:48.914 --> 40:50.480
He followed me to the laundromat

40:50.482 --> 40:52.148
and he put a severed
foot in the dryer

40:52.150 --> 40:53.716
when I was out
getting cupcakes.

40:53.718 --> 40:55.452
- What the hell are
you talking about?

40:55.454 --> 40:57.086
- Les sent me a severed finger

40:57.088 --> 40:59.722
and he put a fucking
severed foot in our laundry.

40:59.724 --> 41:03.159
- Nothing that you're saying
makes any sense right now.

41:03.161 --> 41:06.229
Why do you think I was at
the laundromat for so long?

41:06.231 --> 41:08.631
- I don't know.
- I was talking to the police.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.500
- Here's the police report.
Look at it.

41:10.502 --> 41:11.968
This is a fucking nightmare.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.603
Take it!

41:13.605 --> 41:15.872
- Okay, so where's this foot?

41:15.874 --> 41:17.474
- The police took it.

41:17.476 --> 41:19.242
- Where did they take it?

41:19.244 --> 41:20.543
- To the police station.

41:20.545 --> 41:22.011
You think they're going
to let me bring it home

41:22.013 --> 41:23.146
and use it as a doorstop?

41:23.148 --> 41:24.247
It's evidence.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.082
- Who's foot is it, Ron?
Who's foot?

41:26.084 --> 41:27.917
- Daniel day-Lewis'?

41:27.919 --> 41:30.019
How am I supposed to know
whose fucking foot it is.

41:30.021 --> 41:31.254
I don't know.

41:31.256 --> 41:33.223
Cut me some fucking
slack here, okay.

41:33.225 --> 41:35.024
Somebody is fucking
with me in a big,

41:35.026 --> 41:39.028
major fucking way,
and it's this guy here.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.631
- Wait. What did you do
with the laundry?

41:41.633 --> 41:43.833
- I threw it away.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.969
- Why would you throw
the laundry away?

41:45.971 --> 41:47.437
- Do you want me to bring
the laundry back here?

41:47.439 --> 41:49.205
There was a hot, severed,
festering foot in the laundry.

41:49.207 --> 41:50.273
You want me to
bring it back here?

41:50.275 --> 41:51.774
Do you know how
unsanitary that is?

41:51.776 --> 41:53.977
I was thinking about us.
That shit's toxic.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.278
- I fucking hate you.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.981
My favorite shirt
was in that laundry.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.887
- Can I talk to you
for a second please?

42:03.889 --> 42:07.790
It'll just take a second.
Just have a seat, please.

42:10.294 --> 42:13.530
Your book bag looks a
little heavy today.

42:13.532 --> 42:14.998
What you got in there?

42:15.000 --> 42:19.002
- Since when did you start
carrying books in your book bag?

42:19.004 --> 42:24.474
Listen, I just learned that
your grandfather had his...

42:24.476 --> 42:26.676
He lost his foot.

42:26.678 --> 42:27.644
- What?

42:27.646 --> 42:30.046
- He had his foot amputated?

42:30.048 --> 42:31.714
- He had his leg amputated.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.551
- So, it's true.

42:34.553 --> 42:37.086
- What are you saying right now?

42:37.088 --> 42:39.188
- Do you have access
to the foot?

42:39.190 --> 42:40.890
Did you have access to
the foot in some way?

42:40.892 --> 42:43.159
- No, I do not have
access to his foot.

42:43.161 --> 42:45.261
- Look, rain.
I know you don't like me, okay.

42:45.263 --> 42:47.297
But what you're doing
is criminal behavior

42:47.299 --> 42:48.831
and if you don't stop,
I'm telling you,

42:48.833 --> 42:51.067
it could jeopardize your
chances at college.

42:51.069 --> 42:54.037
- What are you
accusing me of, exactly?

42:54.039 --> 42:56.706
- Just stop what
you're doing, sister.

42:56.708 --> 42:57.707
- Sister?

42:57.709 --> 42:58.942
- Just, stop what you're doing

42:58.944 --> 43:02.045
because if you don't stop
what you're doing,

43:02.047 --> 43:05.114
I'm going to make your life
a living hell, okay.

43:05.116 --> 43:06.983
I'm going to fuck you up.

43:06.985 --> 43:08.618
- You're fucking ridiculous.

43:08.620 --> 43:12.121
- If you keep interfering
with my life, okay?

43:12.123 --> 43:15.024
I just want you to know that.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.997
Okay.

43:20.999 --> 43:22.632
- He's making the
whole thing up.

43:22.634 --> 43:24.701
- Of course he is.

43:24.703 --> 43:27.770
- I manage multi-million
dollar accounts.

43:27.772 --> 43:30.640
I do business with
fortune 500 CEOs.

43:30.642 --> 43:33.042
- No, you don't.
Which ones?

43:33.044 --> 43:35.311
- Okay, middle-managers.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.647
But they could be CEOs one day.

43:37.649 --> 43:39.749
- What's your point?

43:39.751 --> 43:42.318
- The point is that I'm not
sending body parts to Ron

43:42.320 --> 43:44.621
and the fact that I'm having
dinner to defend myself

43:44.623 --> 43:46.255
is beyond insulting.

43:46.257 --> 43:50.727
- It's about more than that.
It's about fixing things.

43:51.328 --> 43:53.630
- I'm not ready.

44:00.337 --> 44:02.905
- There's a lot of negative
energy between us right now,

44:02.907 --> 44:05.908
but the important thing
is that we're here

44:05.910 --> 44:08.978
and we're being honest
with each other.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.313
It shows that we care

44:10.315 --> 44:14.283
and that we think this
friendship is worth saving.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.286
Right?

44:17.288 --> 44:18.388
- Uh-huh.

44:18.390 --> 44:20.289
- Great speech.
- Thanks.

44:20.291 --> 44:22.091
- Seriously.
Martin Luther King, Jr. worthy.

44:22.093 --> 44:23.960
- Are you all ready to order?

44:23.962 --> 44:26.062
- I'm not really hungry but
I'll have another drink please.

44:26.064 --> 44:27.230
- Me too,
I'll have another one.

44:27.232 --> 44:28.831
- Yeah, more sangria, please.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.900
- Yeah.
Another, please.

44:30.902 --> 44:33.670
- Just keep them coming, okay.
Just keep bringing drinks.

44:33.672 --> 44:36.105
- Of course.
- Yeah, thanks.

44:36.875 --> 44:40.209
We can probably just have
something light tonight,

44:40.211 --> 44:41.744
like fingerfood.

44:41.746 --> 44:44.247
Les, you've probably have
some on hand, right?

44:44.249 --> 44:45.915
Fingerfood? Can you give
us some finger food?

44:45.917 --> 44:48.051
A little finger action?

44:48.053 --> 44:49.252
- You know, Ron,

44:49.254 --> 44:51.120
I'm not the
passive-aggressive type.

44:51.122 --> 44:53.856
If I wanted revenge, I wouldn't
send you body parts.

44:53.858 --> 44:56.059
I'd just take you out back
and beat the shit out of you.

44:56.061 --> 44:57.293
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

44:57.295 --> 44:58.361
- And I still might.

44:58.363 --> 45:01.164
- Let's go out here, right now.
- Let's go.

45:01.166 --> 45:02.932
- Just stop it.
Sit down, right now.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.434
- You wanna go?
- Sit down. Sit down.

45:04.436 --> 45:06.035
- You think I'm playing around?

45:06.037 --> 45:08.071
- No one is going outside.

45:08.073 --> 45:10.006
- We're going to sit here
like mature adults

45:10.008 --> 45:11.441
- and work through this.
- If Italy and Turkey
were in a war,

45:11.443 --> 45:14.844
we'd fucking beat the
shit out of all you guys.

45:14.846 --> 45:16.879
- We own you!
- No, we'd fuck you up!

45:16.881 --> 45:19.115
- Constantinople?
That's a Roman city?

45:19.117 --> 45:21.217
- That was then.
I'm talking about now.

45:21.219 --> 45:22.452
- Yeah, that shit's coming back.

45:22.454 --> 45:24.487
- Turkish little prick.
- Right in front.

45:24.489 --> 45:26.122
- Right here, right now.

45:26.124 --> 45:28.791
- Men are so stupid.

45:30.829 --> 45:36.365
- Alcohol is the greatest
drug on earth, you know.

45:36.367 --> 45:38.501
There's a reason why
they call them spirits.

45:38.503 --> 45:39.902
Because they sure do lift them.

45:39.904 --> 45:41.237
- I've got to make a phone call.

45:41.239 --> 45:42.905
- Who you gonna call?

45:42.907 --> 45:45.475
- Ghostbusters.
None of your fucking business.

45:45.477 --> 45:48.044
- Tell bill Murray I said hello.

45:48.046 --> 45:51.981
- It's just a work thing.
I'll be right back.

45:53.118 --> 45:57.987
Isn't les like that asshole boss
that everyone hates at work?

45:57.989 --> 46:00.857
He's always looking over your
shoulder and micro-managing you.

46:00.859 --> 46:02.425
Now that he's gone,
it's like we're on vacation

46:02.427 --> 46:03.793
and we can just relax.

46:03.795 --> 46:05.228
- I'm going to go to the
bathroom.

46:05.230 --> 46:06.395
- Okay, baby.
I love you.

46:06.397 --> 46:09.332
- Uh-huh.
Try not to finger each other.

46:10.267 --> 46:12.869
- That's funny.
Isn't that funny?

46:12.871 --> 46:14.904
- No.

46:26.416 --> 46:29.418
- Everything's falling apart.
Right before our very eyes.

46:29.420 --> 46:33.256
- Who cares?
Another failed marriage or two.

46:33.258 --> 46:36.058
It's not even going to make
a dent in the divorce rate.

46:36.060 --> 46:38.127
Think about what's
happening in Iraq.

46:38.129 --> 46:41.264
They've got problems.
This is nothing.

46:41.266 --> 46:43.299
- I have a healthy marriage.

46:43.301 --> 46:47.036
I had a healthy marriage.
And I have to fix this.

46:47.038 --> 46:48.371
- Be honest.

46:48.373 --> 46:49.839
Don't you think these
two are blowing things

46:49.841 --> 46:51.440
out of proportion
a little bit.

46:51.442 --> 46:53.476
- Yeah, a little bit.

46:53.944 --> 46:55.311
- Is that really the worst
thing you've ever done?

46:55.313 --> 46:57.180
Cheated on your husband?

46:57.182 --> 47:00.049
- I don't consider what
happened with you cheating.

47:00.051 --> 47:02.318
I've done more than that
with first cousins, okay?

47:02.320 --> 47:03.920
- Then why are you so guilty?

47:03.922 --> 47:05.421
Why are you overridden
with guilt?

47:05.423 --> 47:07.957
You're not supposed to do
that when you're married.

47:07.959 --> 47:11.928
- I don't think so.
I just think you're confused.

47:11.930 --> 47:15.932
- Les showed me video
of you in college.

47:15.934 --> 47:19.035
You were at some kind of parade,
and you were down on all fours

47:19.037 --> 47:21.470
and you were wearing furry ears
and howling at the moon.

47:21.472 --> 47:24.207
I don't know what that was
about but it was ridiculous.

47:24.209 --> 47:27.009
- That was for animal rights.

47:27.011 --> 47:29.846
That wasn't confusion.
It was for animal rights.

47:29.848 --> 47:32.348
- Animals don't have rights,
Kate.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.283
- Yes, they do.

47:34.285 --> 47:36.853
- You and Bob barker,
i swear to god.

47:36.855 --> 47:38.487
- What about Bob barker?

47:38.489 --> 47:40.056
- Remember, at the end
of the price is right,

47:40.058 --> 47:44.360
he would say, "get your
pets spayed and neutered."

47:44.362 --> 47:46.095
- Remember when he'd say that?
- Yeah. Yeah, you should.

47:46.097 --> 47:48.965
- He's the one who should
have been neutered, okay.

47:48.967 --> 47:51.467
He was fucking
everybody on that show.

47:51.469 --> 47:53.369
They should have cut his
balls off, probably.

47:53.371 --> 47:56.005
- Well, listen.
That's the other thing.

47:56.007 --> 47:58.074
He peed on a puppy

47:58.076 --> 48:01.510
and I think that's why i
just wanted to hurt him.

48:01.512 --> 48:04.914
That's why I told him about us.

48:04.916 --> 48:06.649
- Bob barker peed on a puppy?

48:06.651 --> 48:09.118
- No!
Les peed on a puppy.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.519
- Les peed on a puppy?
- Yes.

48:10.521 --> 48:12.388
- Why did he pee on a puppy?
- I don't know.

48:12.390 --> 48:13.890
- What kind of person
pees on a puppy?

48:13.892 --> 48:16.392
- It's disturbing, I know.
- It is disturbing.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.928
- It's serial killer shit
is what it is.

48:18.930 --> 48:20.529
That's what they do.
It's a common denominator.

48:20.531 --> 48:22.398
They torture animals
at a young age.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.934
I'm telling you.
He's sending me body parts.

48:24.936 --> 48:27.003
- He is.
- No, he's not.

48:27.005 --> 48:31.240
He looked you in the eyes and
he told you he wasn't doing it.

48:31.242 --> 48:33.142
He is not sending
you body parts.

48:33.144 --> 48:35.144
- I don't believe it.
- He's not. No.

48:35.146 --> 48:36.946
- Especially now,
after hearing this.

48:36.948 --> 48:38.981
- He would never.
- He's dangerous.

48:38.983 --> 48:40.516
- You're in danger.

48:41.018 --> 48:43.019
- Oh hey, what's up?

48:43.021 --> 48:44.921
We were just talking about
"the brothers karamazov,

48:44.923 --> 48:46.389
that book,
that Russian novel.

48:46.391 --> 48:47.657
If I had finished reading it,

48:47.659 --> 48:49.692
it might have been the
best book I ever read.

48:49.694 --> 48:51.694
- I didn't finish it either.

48:51.696 --> 48:53.663
- What's on your face?

48:53.665 --> 48:55.631
- Should we order some food?

48:55.633 --> 48:58.634
I am fucking starving.

49:01.973 --> 49:04.240
♪

49:13.317 --> 49:15.251
- Yeah.

49:15.253 --> 49:18.020
Right there.
Yeah, that's good.

49:24.061 --> 49:26.662
Oh yeah.
Fuck me harder!

49:26.664 --> 49:28.197
Yeah.

49:29.499 --> 49:32.969
Oh god!
Oh god!

49:34.371 --> 49:36.072
Harder!

49:36.074 --> 49:37.974
Pull my hair!

49:41.078 --> 49:42.611
- Oh god.
Oh god.

49:42.613 --> 49:45.348
- Cum on my stomach!
Cum on my stomach!

49:45.350 --> 49:48.384
Yeah, yeah.

49:51.588 --> 49:54.090
- My god.

49:54.092 --> 49:56.625
That was amazing.

50:00.163 --> 50:01.597
I love you.

50:01.599 --> 50:03.666
- I love you.

50:12.409 --> 50:15.077
- Are we that shallow that all
it takes is a little payback

50:15.079 --> 50:16.645
and all is well?

50:16.647 --> 50:19.215
I make out with your friend,
you make out with my friend

50:19.217 --> 50:20.649
and the slate's wiped clean.

50:20.651 --> 50:23.252
- We didn't just make out.

50:23.254 --> 50:24.787
- Where did you do it?
In the bathroom?

50:24.789 --> 50:27.123
- Is that where you hooked up?
- Uh-huh.

50:27.125 --> 50:29.091
- I'm not even jealous.

50:29.093 --> 50:31.761
- Yeah, but we didn't
just make out, Ron.

50:31.763 --> 50:32.762
- What do you mean?

50:32.764 --> 50:35.331
- I gave him a blowjob.

50:42.139 --> 50:44.273
- Okay,
let me just get this straight.

50:44.275 --> 50:48.244
So you're saying that women
should wear the hijab.

50:48.246 --> 50:52.648
- I think I may be starting to
understand why women should...

50:52.650 --> 50:54.417
- So they have an obligation?

50:54.419 --> 50:56.519
- Not an obligation,
but I feel I understand...

50:56.521 --> 50:58.154
- Is that their only obligation?

50:58.156 --> 51:00.823
- I understand why there's
a reason behind, why,

51:00.825 --> 51:02.591
- maybe, they should wear it.
- So, what's the reason?

51:02.593 --> 51:05.227
Because men can't
control themselves?

51:05.229 --> 51:07.329
- I think that's a very
good way to look at it.

51:07.331 --> 51:09.565
Because men think
about sex all the time.

51:09.567 --> 51:11.600
- Women think about sex too.

51:11.602 --> 51:13.436
- I know women think
about sex all the time.

51:13.438 --> 51:17.306
If you all didn't act upon
your sexual impulses so much,

51:17.308 --> 51:21.677
maybe there wouldn't be
these things happening here.

51:23.681 --> 51:25.815
- You used to be my
favorite teacher.

51:25.817 --> 51:27.650
Now I think you're a scum.

51:27.652 --> 51:29.718
- I was just...Uh...

51:29.720 --> 51:32.254
- Talk about empathy.

51:32.256 --> 51:34.757
- Do we belong in a kitchen too?

51:34.759 --> 51:36.659
- I'm really disappointed.

51:50.807 --> 51:53.609
- Hey.
- Hey.

51:59.883 --> 52:02.384
- So, you're just not
going to talk to me now?

52:02.386 --> 52:05.287
- There's nothing to talk about.

52:06.756 --> 52:09.625
- Well, how about,
"how's your day?"

52:09.627 --> 52:11.627
- Do you want to know
how my day went?
- Yeah.

52:11.629 --> 52:13.129
- Same day as it always is.

52:13.131 --> 52:14.697
I'm teaching a bunch of
useless information

52:14.699 --> 52:17.733
who don't give a fuck
what I have to say.

52:17.735 --> 52:19.368
That's how my day went.

52:20.905 --> 52:23.772
- Who's that?
- I ordered Chinese food.

52:23.774 --> 52:26.575
- Oh, well,
did you get me some?

52:26.577 --> 52:28.577
- Nope.

52:30.180 --> 52:31.413
Keep the change.

52:31.415 --> 52:33.449
- Thanks.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.454
♪

52:42.225 --> 52:43.559
- They don't sell
organic tampons

52:43.561 --> 52:44.860
at the commissary.

52:44.862 --> 52:46.395
They sell that generic shit.

52:46.397 --> 52:48.531
It feels like fly paper.
I can't use that.

52:48.533 --> 52:52.568
- It's not my fault
you've got a sensitive vagina.

52:52.570 --> 52:54.937
- So that's how it's
going to be, huh?

52:54.939 --> 52:58.340
- You're just going to act
like I'm not here.

52:58.342 --> 52:59.508
- I guess so.

52:59.510 --> 53:02.611
- Real mature, Ron.

53:02.613 --> 53:04.547
- I guess so.

53:04.549 --> 53:07.516
- You know what your problem is?
- I guess so.

53:07.518 --> 53:09.852
- You're a hypocrite.
- Uh-huh. Yep.

53:09.854 --> 53:11.921
- How is what I did any
different than what you did?

53:11.923 --> 53:15.824
With you having les' cock
in your mouth.

53:15.826 --> 53:18.928
- Oh, okay. So your excuse is,
"oh, I got drunk,

53:18.930 --> 53:20.095
- it didn't mean anything."
- That's right.

53:20.097 --> 53:21.964
- Can't I use the same excuse?
- That's exactly right.

53:21.966 --> 53:23.599
- You can't use the
same fucking excuse.

53:23.601 --> 53:24.967
It's not the same fucking thing.

53:24.969 --> 53:26.969
- Goddammit!
- What?

53:26.971 --> 53:28.871
- There's a fucking
cock in my mouth!

53:28.873 --> 53:31.941
There's a penis in my
fucking Chinese food!

53:35.845 --> 53:38.514
- So you normally make
all the deliveries here?

53:38.516 --> 53:41.450
- But you didn't
deliver it this time.

53:41.452 --> 53:44.853
- Well, I was on my way here,
but a guy stopped me downstairs.

53:44.855 --> 53:47.289
He said he was staying
in the same apartment.

53:47.291 --> 53:50.859
So he paid for the food and
he said he would bring it up.

53:50.861 --> 53:52.494
- So you let him
bring the food up?

53:52.496 --> 53:54.630
Because he knew the
apartment number.

53:54.632 --> 53:55.931
He knew Mr. Ron's name.

53:55.933 --> 53:58.801
And he seemed to
be a very nice guy.

53:58.803 --> 54:02.004
I didn't think anything bad
was going to happen.

54:02.006 --> 54:04.340
Besides, he gave me a big tip.

54:04.342 --> 54:07.376
You get a big tip and i
get a big dick in my mouth.

54:07.378 --> 54:08.577
That's a fair exchange.

54:08.579 --> 54:09.812
- I'm so sorry, Ron.

54:09.814 --> 54:11.614
I brought you a new order,
on the house.

54:11.616 --> 54:13.616
- You keep it, okay.
I lost my appetite.

54:13.618 --> 54:15.618
I'll probably never
eat again after tonight.

54:15.620 --> 54:17.253
- Well, look on the bright side.

54:17.255 --> 54:19.021
Think of all the weight
you'll lose.

54:19.023 --> 54:22.725
- Hey, hey, hey.
We don't need that kind of talk.

54:22.727 --> 54:24.693
And in the future,

54:24.695 --> 54:27.029
you need to make all the
deliveries yourself, okay.

54:27.031 --> 54:29.932
- But I didn't know.
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.467
Is this going to
be on the Internet?

54:31.469 --> 54:32.701
- I don't know about that.

54:32.703 --> 54:35.037
- It's going to kill my
business. Very badly.

54:35.039 --> 54:37.339
- We'll try to keep it
under wraps, okay?

54:37.341 --> 54:38.907
- Okay.
Thank you, officer.

54:38.909 --> 54:40.943
- Mr. Wells. Do you recall
what the man looked like

54:40.945 --> 54:42.578
who delivered the food?

54:42.580 --> 54:44.013
- I didn't even see the guy!

54:44.015 --> 54:46.682
- I just gave him the money
and he gave me the food,

54:46.684 --> 54:51.420
- so you don't look people in
the eyes when you talk to them?

54:52.422 --> 54:54.590
- I was agitated.

54:54.592 --> 54:57.059
- Why were you agitated?

54:58.928 --> 55:01.497
- Domestic issues.

55:01.499 --> 55:05.034
- What kind of domestic issues?

55:05.036 --> 55:06.669
- Personal shit, man.
Its' none of your business.

55:06.671 --> 55:10.406
- I just want to know
why you were agitated.

55:10.408 --> 55:13.342
- I'm agitated because you're
asking me why I'm agitated.

55:13.344 --> 55:15.811
I'm agitated because...
I'm just agitated.

55:15.813 --> 55:19.615
I don't like it when people
ask me why I'm agitated...

55:19.617 --> 55:21.483
I don't know.

55:21.951 --> 55:23.952
- Miss, are you okay?

55:23.954 --> 55:26.355
- It's Mrs. and she's fine.

55:26.357 --> 55:29.458
- I got it.
- God damn, fucking cock!!

55:29.460 --> 55:31.427
- Let's see if we can
match the severed member

55:31.429 --> 55:32.528
to the severed foot.

55:32.530 --> 55:34.797
It might be from the same body.

55:34.799 --> 55:37.833
- Judging from the foot size,
I'd say it is.

55:37.835 --> 55:40.069
- Ma'am, if you have
any trouble at all,

55:40.071 --> 55:41.437
don't hesitate to call me.

55:41.439 --> 55:45.574
- Wait a second, why are you
giving her special treatment?

55:45.576 --> 55:48.711
I'm the one who
got violated, man.

55:48.713 --> 55:49.978
- Calm down, buddy.

55:49.980 --> 55:51.380
- Don't tell me to calm down.

55:51.382 --> 55:52.915
There was a severed dick
in my mouth.

55:52.917 --> 55:54.616
I've sucked a dick before,
in college,

55:54.618 --> 55:56.885
but it was attached
to a body, okay.

55:56.887 --> 55:58.620
And my wife is running around

55:58.622 --> 55:59.855
acting like a fucking
sword swallower

55:59.857 --> 56:01.423
from the barnum
and Bailey circus.

56:01.425 --> 56:03.726
And out of all the cops in
Brooklyn they can send me,

56:03.728 --> 56:06.095
they send me andré the giant
and Betty boop.

56:06.097 --> 56:08.664
Okay, I want some
fucking answers!

56:10.000 --> 56:11.633
- No, I'll tell you this,

56:11.635 --> 56:15.404
if I found a penis
in my Chinese food,

56:15.406 --> 56:17.639
I'd probably throw a rock
through the window.

56:17.641 --> 56:21.643
What's the name of the place?
What is it?

56:21.645 --> 56:24.513
Hong Kong castle?

56:24.515 --> 56:27.483
They should change it
to long dong castle.

56:27.485 --> 56:30.619
Be careful ordering noodles
from that place, people.

56:30.621 --> 56:33.555
You might get
something a little extra.

56:36.025 --> 56:38.861
Anyway, by now most
of you have heard,

56:38.863 --> 56:41.530
the chastity fielding 27,

56:41.532 --> 56:43.699
crashed after take-off
on Tuesday.

56:43.701 --> 56:46.769
This was supposed to be the
first commercial airplane

56:46.771 --> 56:49.037
to orbit the earth.

56:49.039 --> 56:50.572
- This place is great.

56:50.574 --> 56:52.141
I had dinner here
a few weeks ago.

56:52.143 --> 56:55.411
Yeah, well,
i hope you're paying.

56:55.413 --> 56:57.913
Chastity stock is
down 50 percent.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.715
- It's all right, Barry.
Don't worry.

56:59.717 --> 57:01.083
I got this.

57:01.085 --> 57:04.653
- "Consumer space travel,
that's the way of the future."

57:04.655 --> 57:06.822
- That's what you said, dude.
- It is. It is.

57:06.824 --> 57:08.924
- Well, if that first test
flight is any indication,

57:08.926 --> 57:10.492
the future looks pretty bleak.

57:10.494 --> 57:12.628
- Come on, Barry.
Listen.

57:12.630 --> 57:15.898
It's a test,
the rocket exploded in a test.

57:15.900 --> 57:17.800
That's what a test is for.

57:17.802 --> 57:20.035
- You guys ready to order?
- Yeah, I think so.

57:20.037 --> 57:22.438
- I was over hearing
your conversation

57:22.440 --> 57:24.640
about the chastity thing.

57:24.642 --> 57:26.475
Man, that was a tragedy, huh.

57:26.477 --> 57:30.145
They'll get a consumer flight
into space before you know it

57:30.147 --> 57:32.548
and that stock's going to
take off like a rocket.

57:32.550 --> 57:34.683
- Hopefully, it doesn't take
off like the last one did.

57:34.685 --> 57:36.618
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure
they're going to get it up.

57:36.620 --> 57:37.986
There's no doubt about that.

57:37.988 --> 57:40.656
It's only a matter of time.

57:40.658 --> 57:42.991
Can you imagine
being that pilot?

57:42.993 --> 57:47.663
Having trained his whole life
for that one moment.

57:47.665 --> 57:53.802
And then you're finally up
soaring toward the sky and

57:53.804 --> 57:59.208
everything you studied for,
hoped for, dreamed for....

57:59.210 --> 58:01.076
Gone.

58:01.078 --> 58:04.480
- Honey,
nobody is following you.

58:06.716 --> 58:09.051
Really,
with the spitting, still?

58:12.055 --> 58:15.557
So, they're not actually
firing you, right?

58:15.559 --> 58:17.493
- No, it's a leave of absence.

58:17.495 --> 58:19.161
- Okay, so great.
How long?

58:19.163 --> 58:20.796
- Like, a month.

58:20.798 --> 58:21.964
- And they're paying you?

58:21.966 --> 58:23.565
- Yeah.

58:23.567 --> 58:25.667
- Okay, so what's the big deal?

58:25.669 --> 58:28.003
- I don't get why companies act
like a leave of absence with pay

58:28.005 --> 58:29.104
is punishment.

58:29.106 --> 58:30.873
It's a gift.

58:30.875 --> 58:33.175
- That's a good way
of looking at it.

58:33.576 --> 58:35.077
- Hi.

58:36.713 --> 58:38.514
- Hi.

58:52.195 --> 58:54.963
- What the fuck are you doing?

58:54.965 --> 58:57.032
- I'm not really hungry.

58:57.034 --> 59:00.002
You got any wine or any liquor?

59:00.004 --> 59:04.706
- I know who's sending
you body parts.

59:04.708 --> 59:07.676
Fuck it, let's have a drink.

59:09.979 --> 59:13.615
- It's just too simple, man.
It's not that simple.
- Why?

59:13.617 --> 59:15.651
- Because there are too many...
- Too many what?

59:15.653 --> 59:17.619
- Too many suspects.
- Who?

59:17.621 --> 59:19.621
- You.

59:19.623 --> 59:22.758
- I'm not sending you
body parts, okay.

59:22.760 --> 59:25.260
- My students, for one.

59:25.262 --> 59:26.762
- Who?

59:26.764 --> 59:28.630
- Rain, the one who hates me.

59:28.632 --> 59:29.765
- Why would she send you
body parts?

59:29.767 --> 59:31.133
- Because she hates me.

59:31.135 --> 59:32.935
- Where would she
get the body parts?

59:32.937 --> 59:36.171
- Her grandfather has diabetes;
They amputated his foot.

59:36.173 --> 59:38.173
- That's fucking ridiculous.

59:38.175 --> 59:40.976
- You thought she took her
grandfather's amputated foot

59:40.978 --> 59:43.145
and put it in the dryer?

59:43.147 --> 59:45.314
- It's not funny.
- Yes, it is.

59:45.316 --> 59:46.748
- Actually it isn't.

59:46.750 --> 59:48.350
My uncle has diabetes.

59:48.352 --> 59:51.019
- Tom Hanks has diabetes.
- What?

59:51.021 --> 59:54.990
- Okay and then I thought
maybe it was rain's mom.

59:54.992 --> 59:56.892
- Why would she
send you body parts?

59:56.894 --> 59:58.961
- She hates arabs, okay

59:58.963 --> 01:00:01.029
and that's the new trend
in the world,

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.364
is to blame the muslims.

01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:03.932
- You're not Muslim.
- She doesn't know that.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.867
- It's this guy, the waiter.

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:08.003
He overheard us
talking that night.

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:09.905
- Where did he get my name?
Where did he get our address?

01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:12.074
- You paid for dinner.

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:15.911
- Yeah, I remember, because
you never pay for dinner.

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:17.346
But you did that night.

01:00:17.348 --> 01:00:20.115
So he has your name and he
has your credit card number.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:21.950
Finding out your address
with that information

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:23.185
isn't that difficult.

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:24.953
- Okay, possibly.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:28.724
But the chances that it's the
same guy from college,

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:31.126
- that was 20 years ago,
there's no fucking way.
- So what?

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:34.029
- It's too coincidental.
- This shit happens
all the time.

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:35.163
- He's right, he's right.

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:37.366
My aunt turned 50,
she went to Tibet

01:00:37.368 --> 01:00:39.234
on a mountain
climbing expedition.

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:41.236
She gets to the top
of this mountain,

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:44.239
there's a man sitting on a rock,
next to a camp fire.

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:46.008
It's her high school
sweetheart,

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:47.843
who she has not seen
in 30 years.

01:00:47.845 --> 01:00:49.845
- Bullshit.
- I swear to god it's true.

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:52.280
It's like the guy who
accidentally fucked his sister

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:53.749
at a frat party.

01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:55.350
- It's a little more
romantic than that.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:57.085
- I hired a private investigator

01:00:57.087 --> 01:00:58.920
to do a background
check on this guy

01:00:58.922 --> 01:01:00.022
and find out who he is.

01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:01.757
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:03.191
- We can't afford a
private investigator.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:06.395
- You don't have to worry about
it, I'm taking care of it.

01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:08.764
- Well, that's pretty
big of you.

01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:10.432
- Well, I'm a big man, Ron.

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:14.136
- Yeah, you are, very big.

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:17.139
- Well, you would know, Nicki.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.841
- What are you talking about?

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:23.078
- Oh, he didn't tell you?

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.247
- Tell me what?

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:29.418
- You fucked around with him,
and that's what happens.
- I didn't fuck around with him.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:35.457
- This is how I felt
for the last two weeks!
- She sucked your dick?

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:37.826
- I can't even believe you!

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:06.455
- His name is Wally Moore,

01:02:06.457 --> 01:02:10.292
age 42,
lives in sunset park,

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:12.794
born and raised in
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:14.096
He waits tables at the raven.

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:15.430
- Where did this guy
go to college?

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:17.866
- Boston college,
that's where I went to school,

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:20.001
- it's got to be the same guy.
- Holy shit.

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:21.336
- What year did he graduate?

01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:22.804
- He didn't.
- Why?

01:02:22.806 --> 01:02:24.840
- It says he dropped out
his sophomore year.

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:28.810
- I don't know. It's strange
too, he had a scholarship.

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:30.946
- What kind of scholarship?

01:02:30.948 --> 01:02:32.280
- Music.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:35.751
Turns out, he had been
a noted saxophonist

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:37.352
from the time he was a child.

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:40.355
He was considered
something of a prodigy.

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:41.823
- A prodigy, really?

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:43.091
- Yeah, he must have
been very good

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.961
because he's missing two
fingers on his hand.

01:02:45.963 --> 01:02:47.329
- Fuck.

01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:50.899
- I ruined the guy's life.
- Come on, don't say that.

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:52.100
- What's he talking about?

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:54.035
- He cut the guys fingers off.

01:02:54.037 --> 01:02:56.872
- Why did you do that?
- It was an accident.

01:02:56.874 --> 01:02:58.173
- Oh, well,
that would account for

01:02:58.175 --> 01:02:59.541
why he dropped out
of college.

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:01.042
- I fucked his whole life up.

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:03.378
He had dreams of being
the next Charlie Parker.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:08.183
I severed his dreams,
literally, severed his dreams.

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:11.052
You can't be a saxophone player
with fucking three fingers.

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:13.855
- Hey, look, remember
that one-armed drummer

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:15.991
from that rock band
back in the 80's?

01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:18.026
- Remember that guy?
- Uh-huh.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:20.362
- What's your point?

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:22.330
- I don't really have one.

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:24.966
How'd you find out all
this information so quickly?

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.401
- Are you kidding?

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:29.938
I got half this shit
off his Facebook page.

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:33.308
- Oh, he looks happy.
- He does, doesn't he?

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.843
- He doesn't look sad at all.

01:03:34.845 --> 01:03:36.311
- Maybe I didn't ruin his life.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:39.047
- No, I think you
probably ruined his life.

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:40.515
- Why do you say that?

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:43.919
- He likes to go to a
jazz club called dino's.

01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:45.587
- You know the place?
- No.

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:47.088
- Yeah, I know the place.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.392
- Yeah, okay.
Well, go there sometime.

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:53.295
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:55.997
He's there almost every night.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.168
♪

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:48.617
- What do we do, guys?

01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:49.951
- We should follow him.

01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:50.619
- What?
- You want to follow him?

01:04:50.621 --> 01:04:53.355
- I don't know, it's just the
first thing I thought of.

01:04:53.357 --> 01:04:56.524
- That's a dumb idea.
Think things through for once.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:58.159
- I'm not good at thinking,
okay.

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:00.362
The first time I saw that
famous statue by rodin,

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:01.897
I didn't even
recognize what he was doing.

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:03.231

he looked?

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:04.666
That guys looked
really depressed,

- I did that.
- No, you didn't.

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:09.471
- Yeah, I did.
- It's the music.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:11.273
- That's why they
call it the blues.

01:05:11.275 --> 01:05:12.540
- He could have had
an amazing career.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.075
He could have been
the next scarlatti.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.610

been the next Kenny g.

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:16.912
Maybe you did the world a favor.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:19.114
- I should go talk to him,
maybe.

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:20.849
I should maybe talk to him
and try to make amends,
or something.

01:05:20.851 --> 01:05:22.550
- Ron, you should
go to the police.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.219
He's clearly the guy who's been
sending you those body parts

01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:24.986
and he's dangerous.

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:26.121
- She's right, Ron.

01:05:26.123 --> 01:05:27.956
- Right?

01:05:28.524 --> 01:05:30.258
What?
What's wrong?

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.660
Why are you looking at me
like that?

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:33.228
- I'm just looking at you.

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.664
You're so beautiful.

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:39.534
I can see why les wanted to
put his dick in your mouth.

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:44.673
- I've gotten my fair share of
hate mail all over the years,

01:05:44.675 --> 01:05:48.510
telling me I'm a scumbag,

01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:52.681
the scourge of the earth,
the cancer of the airwaves.

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:56.418
But no one's ever sent
me a severed animal head,

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.552
until today.

01:05:57.554 --> 01:05:59.187
I think it was a cat,

01:05:59.189 --> 01:06:03.992
I didn't keep it long enough
to find out.

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:07.562
It was terrifying
in a lot of ways,

01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:09.264
knowing that someone went
through the trouble

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:10.699
to send me such a thing.

01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:16.104
I'm a little rattled,
i will admit.

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:18.039
But I'm not deterred.

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:48.503
We would like to just ask
you a couple questions.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.373
- Yeah, I've got a second.
What's up?

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:56.344
- Do you have a place,
we can speak privately?

01:06:56.346 --> 01:07:00.048
- Yeah, come on in back.

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:02.083
- Thank you, sir.

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.091
- So I got something here
for you,

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:11.393
one of my favorite things.

01:07:11.395 --> 01:07:14.396
This place has the best
cupcakes in Brooklyn.

01:07:14.398 --> 01:07:17.032
So these are red velvet,

01:07:17.034 --> 01:07:18.633
- and they are to die for.
- Dig in, buddy.

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:20.568
- They are so good.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.303
- Come on, have one, wycoff.

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:25.106
- You don't eat sugar?
You don't eat sweets?

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:30.078
- Its good, right.
It's delicious, it's amazing.
- Awesome.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.048
- So what's the status?

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:38.686
- We got the DNA samples
back from the body parts.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:40.655
- Well, that's great.
Who's the victim?

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:42.257
- No idea.

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:44.259
We couldn't track the person.

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:47.395
It's a male, white guy,
that's all we know.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.297
- That could be anybody.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:52.634
- That's correct, there are a
lot of white people in New York.

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:58.406
- Okay, so now what?
What happens now?

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:01.743
- So, we don't know who it is.

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:05.814
But this is where it gets
especially strange.

01:08:05.816 --> 01:08:07.182
- Okay.

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:10.351
- The blood on the foot,
it wasn't real.

01:08:10.353 --> 01:08:12.821
- That doesn't make
any sense at all.

01:08:12.823 --> 01:08:15.457
- That doesn't make any sense.

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:17.859
- You're saying it's fake blood?

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:20.562
Like fake blood from
like, the fake blood store?

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:22.764
- Tomato sauce.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.166
- Tomato...Tomato sauce?

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.602
- Marinara.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:30.305
- Marinara?
Marinara?

01:08:30.307 --> 01:08:31.840
Marinara, marinara,
like, the marinara sauce,

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:34.809
- yeah, marinara, marinara.
Yeah.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:38.580
- Why would the guy put
marinara sauce on a real foot?

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:40.715
- Why would he do that?
- That, my friend,
is a good question.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.317
- Yeah, and what's the answer?

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:45.120
- I don't have the answer.
The guy's probably nuts.

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:47.455
- Yeah, the guys' probably nuts.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.390

01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:51.359

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:53.862

the guy I went to college with.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:57.398

Yeah, we talked to him.

01:09:01.505 --> 01:09:03.738
- You didn't arrest the guy?
- No.

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.140
- Why didn't you arrest the guy?

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:06.608
- I just told you,
he didn't do it.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:07.742

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.477
This is the guy,
I'm telling you...

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.613

and he was a really nice guy.

- He is, yeah.

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:49.470
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:52.039
- So, a finger, a foot,
and a penis.

01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:53.440
That's all your friend sent you?

01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:55.542
- Finger, foot and penis.
Yeah.

01:21:55.544 --> 01:22:00.281
- That thing with the Chinese
restaurant and the penis.

01:22:00.283 --> 01:22:02.416
That video was all over
the Internet, man.

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:06.553
- It's not funny, man.
It's not funny.

01:22:06.555 --> 01:22:08.689
That restaurant
went out of business.

01:22:08.691 --> 01:22:11.258
- Oh, well.
I didn't want that to happen.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:14.328
He was a really nice guy
and he had a family.

01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:15.930
- Well, I'd take that back.

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:17.231
- If I could
take it back, I would.

01:22:17.233 --> 01:22:19.066
I would take it back.

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:21.368
- Well, if I could go
back twenty years ago,

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:22.970
I would have never
gone to that frat party,

01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:24.471
that's for sure.

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:34.515
- It's good to have closure.

01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:37.985
- There's no such thing
as closure, Ron.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:44.491
- None of us are saints.

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:49.063
None of us are perfect.
We're fallible.

01:22:49.065 --> 01:22:50.731
We're vulnerable.

01:22:50.733 --> 01:22:55.002
And ultimately, we are
responsible for our actions.

01:22:55.004 --> 01:22:57.504
The choices we make,
the things we do,

01:22:57.506 --> 01:23:04.111
and yes, the words we say,
they all have an effect,

01:23:04.113 --> 01:23:07.081
for better or worse.

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:14.254
For every person I inspire,
there's someone else I piss off.

01:23:14.256 --> 01:23:19.526
For every innocent life lost,
there's a thousand saved.

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:22.129
Flowers grow, flowers die.

01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:24.698
The earth spins itself
round and round.

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:28.335
None of us know what's
going to happen tomorrow.

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:34.341
Maybe it's not that simple.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:37.578
Maybe it is.
I don't have the answers.

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:42.449
I'm just one man
talking into a microphone.

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:46.587
- I fucked les.

01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:51.558
- Anyway, it is Tuesday night
and you know what that means.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:55.062
I want to hear the worst
thing you've ever done.

01:23:55.064 --> 01:23:57.498
If you're brave enough
to share your story,

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.433
please, give me a call.

01:23:59.435 --> 01:24:01.168
Phil, you're on the air.

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:03.604
Worst thing you've ever done?

01:24:03.606 --> 01:24:06.440
- I haven't done
my worst thing yet.

01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:08.709
- Well, everyone's
done their worst.

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:12.546
Even if it's a white lie,
it's still something.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:15.582
- I'm going to do my
worst thing soon.

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:18.052
- Oh yeah.
What's that going to be?

01:24:18.054 --> 01:24:21.188
- I'm going to kill you.

01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:23.290
- Oh.

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:24.825
Is that right?

01:24:24.827 --> 01:24:26.794
- You deserve to die.

01:24:26.796 --> 01:24:28.328
- Why's that?

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:32.066
- I'm assuming you're the
guy sending me animal parts

01:24:32.068 --> 01:24:34.134
in the mail?

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:35.636
Hello.

01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:37.738
- You will die tonight.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:41.408
- Can we get a trace
on this call?

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:48.749
♪

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:09.570
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:12.372
- Smells good.

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:15.843
- Yeah, it's a new recipe.

01:25:15.845 --> 01:25:18.479
- Awesome.

01:25:18.481 --> 01:25:21.248
I want to smell.
Let me smell that.

01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:24.451
- Ooh. Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:30.524
- Hey, you've got a package.

01:25:30.526 --> 01:25:32.526
- I do?

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:34.895
- It's from Ron.

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:37.498
- Really?

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.804
- How's he doing,
by the way?

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:45.873
- Don't ask.

01:26:06.262 --> 01:26:08.228
- Jesus!

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:18.172
- Mr. welz.
Are you all right?

01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:20.641
- I'm good, Christopher.
Thanks for asking.

01:26:20.643 --> 01:26:21.775
- How are you?

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:23.477
- I'm fine.

01:26:23.479 --> 01:26:25.212
- Did you miss me?

01:26:25.214 --> 01:26:28.248
Did any of you all miss me?

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:35.789
Nobody loves Mr. welz anymore.

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:42.796
- What happened?

01:26:49.405 --> 01:26:51.738
But I really don't
want to get into it.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.474
Do we have something to do?

01:26:54.476 --> 01:26:55.976
What are we supposed
to be doing today?

01:26:55.978 --> 01:26:59.346
Isn't...Something...Something...

01:26:59.348 --> 01:27:03.584
- Well, our papers on
"alternative approaches to war"

01:27:03.586 --> 01:27:04.952
were due today.

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:08.488
They were due.

01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:10.390
- Alternative approaches
to war, that's right.

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:13.327
Yeah. Okay.

01:27:13.329 --> 01:27:15.862
Does anyone want to
read their paper?

01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:20.834
Kimberly.
Of course you do.

01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:23.503
Kimberly, with all the answers.

01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:24.938
Well, you don't
have all the answers.

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.840
Put your hand down.
You don't have any answers.

01:27:26.842 --> 01:27:28.442
Nobody has any answers, okay.

01:27:28.444 --> 01:27:30.911
There's no, there's no,
there's no...

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:36.850
Rain, I want to hear
your paper, actually.

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:39.353
Come up here and
enlighten us with your

01:27:39.355 --> 01:27:40.787
alternative approaches to war.

01:27:40.789 --> 01:27:45.425
I'm really curious as to
what you think about all this,

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:47.361
you know.

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:49.930
Because I've learned
something, I think.

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:52.532
Which is right,
it is all bullshit.

01:27:52.534 --> 01:27:54.268
You were trying to
say that all along

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:59.773
because we are just destined to
repeat the mistakes of the past,

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:02.409
you know.

01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:04.044
The byzantine empire,
the Roman empire,

01:28:04.046 --> 01:28:06.413
the ottoman empire,
they all fell

01:28:06.415 --> 01:28:09.349
and our empire's
going to fall too.

01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:11.318
One day,
it's going to collapse, boom,

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.721
although they built
another one in its place,

01:28:14.723 --> 01:28:18.458
there's still going to be
something missing, you know.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:20.060
Face it.

01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:24.431
We're pretty much fucked!

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:32.039
Anyway, rain.
Please, read your paper.

01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:33.707
Everyone's listening.
