09:30.206 --> 09:31.272
[Chuckles] Hmm.

09:32.343 --> 09:33.504
Just like that?

09:34.844 --> 09:36.644
You're not gonna tell me
that sending them all

09:36.713 --> 09:38.302
is a stronger move or...?

09:40.149 --> 09:42.344
What, did you <i> want</i> me to put up a fight?

09:43.886 --> 09:45.907
Or did you just expect me to?

09:47.724 --> 09:49.924
Lastly, Amanda Glasson,
Michigan Democrat

09:49.993 --> 09:51.559
and construction magnate who's found

09:51.627 --> 09:53.527
a lot of creative ways to turn a profit.

09:53.613 --> 09:54.829
I think we're looking at charges

09:54.899 --> 09:58.032
all the way from corporate fraud
to outright treason.

09:58.201 --> 10:01.009
No. I just want your cooperation.

10:01.587 --> 10:02.803
Okay.

10:06.813 --> 10:08.969
I think I've finally come to grips

10:09.078 --> 10:10.845
with doing bad for the greater good.

10:10.938 --> 10:12.906
Clay and I were just
saying the same thing.

10:12.969 --> 10:14.548
Oh. "Clay and I."

10:14.617 --> 10:16.132
We are good friends.

10:16.203 --> 10:19.796
Oh, yeah... I drive out of my
way for three hours every day

10:19.906 --> 10:21.722
to go have dinner with <i> my</i> good friend.

10:21.791 --> 10:24.325
He feels personally responsible
for all of this.

10:24.427 --> 10:25.960
Alex: He feels other
things, too, you know.

10:26.029 --> 10:27.194
I mean, he's not engaged anymore...

10:27.263 --> 10:29.098
hasn't been for four months.

10:29.255 --> 10:32.033
Clay has no idea what he feels for me.

10:32.239 --> 10:34.769
Right now, we are trapped
in a foxhole together.

10:34.966 --> 10:38.114
When this is all over, you know,
we'll see if this was just

10:38.241 --> 10:41.275
an end-of-the-world romance
or if it's real.

10:42.445 --> 10:44.045
I hope it's real.

10:44.147 --> 10:45.046
[Chuckles softly]

10:45.114 --> 10:47.048
So, what about you and Ryan?

10:47.116 --> 10:49.316
Was all of that just
for the tail last night?

10:49.419 --> 10:51.485
He's been so supportive lately,

10:51.554 --> 10:52.987
not doubting me as much.

10:53.056 --> 10:55.856
But I'm just waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

10:55.958 --> 10:58.092
You told him you needed time.

10:58.194 --> 11:00.094
Maybe he used that time to grow.

11:00.129 --> 11:02.930
Or maybe he's just making me <i> think</i>
that he's changed, you know?

11:02.999 --> 11:04.665
And then when things get difficult,

11:04.767 --> 11:06.834
he'll be back to the same old Ryan.

11:06.903 --> 11:08.836
Well, you know what?
Something will happen,

11:08.938 --> 11:12.207
and you'll just know,
one way or another, right?

11:13.209 --> 11:15.209
[Horn honks]

11:15.433 --> 11:18.824
So, are you gonna say something
or just make me watch you?

11:18.926 --> 11:23.265
<i>You</i> are the one who came here
and demanded to talk, so talk.

11:23.486 --> 11:24.985
Clay: I'm sorry.

11:25.054 --> 11:26.654
I'm sorry I used you.

11:26.726 --> 11:28.422
I'm sorry I got you into all this.

11:28.491 --> 11:29.916
I'm sorry I wasn't a better friend.

11:29.994 --> 11:32.193
I lost my job, my green card.

11:32.261 --> 11:34.195
And to make it more interesting,

11:34.263 --> 11:37.131
I have the Russian intelligence
on me day and night

11:37.517 --> 11:40.434
thinking that I'm still gonna tell
them secrets about the president.

11:40.536 --> 11:41.969
You can't fix that.

11:43.272 --> 11:44.805
I'm even afraid to go back to Spain.

11:44.873 --> 11:46.450
I don't want to tarnish
my family's name.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.443
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry. You said that already.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.103
If you...

11:55.188 --> 11:56.954
ever need anything...

11:57.120 --> 11:58.886
Yeah.

11:59.087 --> 12:00.788
I need you to destroy Roarke.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.023
I believed every lie he told me.

12:03.092 --> 12:04.558
And America does, too.

12:04.627 --> 12:06.093
He told them he would fix the country,

12:06.129 --> 12:09.797
and all he wants is to fix it
for himself and his friends.

12:09.866 --> 12:11.765
Tell me how to win.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.668
Anything you can think of,
they've already thought of.

12:14.737 --> 12:16.804
You have known about this plan
for six months.

12:16.873 --> 12:19.085
They waited <i> years</i> for it.

12:19.308 --> 12:22.309
Stop trying to be smarter
than them. Surprise them.

12:22.429 --> 12:25.909
Use kittens, mercury,
and the concept of time.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.687
What's that?

12:27.790 --> 12:31.182
Something my brother told me
that's just making sense to me now.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.385
Don't leave town tonight.

12:33.518 --> 12:35.719
All right. It looks like
we went 4 for 4.

12:35.804 --> 12:36.750
- Whoo!
- Yes!

12:36.836 --> 12:39.085
That should keep Roarke shy
of passing his amendments.

12:39.138 --> 12:40.737
All right. What do we do now?

12:40.806 --> 12:43.306
Wait and pray that everything goes
well at the convention tomorrow?

12:43.375 --> 12:45.175
- Hey.
- Everybody's smartphones in their cars?

12:45.277 --> 12:47.177
- Yeah.
- Did a sweep for bugs?

12:47.246 --> 12:48.686
Every time we walk through the door.

12:48.714 --> 12:50.280
Clay: Well, check again.
I think they're listening.

12:50.349 --> 12:51.412
Maxwell: You're right.

12:51.478 --> 12:54.212
It's a little late to be
keeping secrets now.

12:56.822 --> 12:58.488
You were all so careful,

12:58.582 --> 13:01.591
meeting someplace completely
innocuous four times a week,

13:01.660 --> 13:03.927
like it was any other week
in your lives.

13:04.192 --> 13:07.397
And yet, you always failed to noticed

13:07.466 --> 13:10.367
the newly installed
smart TVs in every corner,

13:10.435 --> 13:12.290
all of which have their mics on,

13:12.437 --> 13:16.534
courtesy of Peter Theo
and his latest firmware updates.

13:16.642 --> 13:19.565
You're all <i> definitely</i>
going in the "no" pile now.

13:19.628 --> 13:21.370
If you were spying on us
this whole time,

13:21.432 --> 13:22.812
why even bother with a tail?

13:22.915 --> 13:25.182
Oh, we just wanted to give you
a false sense of security.

13:25.250 --> 13:28.018
You did put on a hell of a show,
though, for three months.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.387
That took a lot of patience.

13:30.455 --> 13:32.923
Information is a powerful thing.

13:32.991 --> 13:35.310
All of the research you did
on those weak delegates

13:35.389 --> 13:36.460
ahead of tomorrow's convention

13:36.495 --> 13:39.262
is even more useful
in the president's hands.

13:39.364 --> 13:41.826
He had all four of your target delegates

13:41.896 --> 13:45.802
pulled and replaced with
less corruptible individuals.

13:45.871 --> 13:49.072
And now we invite you
to watch democracy evolve

13:49.174 --> 13:51.575
to the next level at the convention.

13:51.643 --> 13:54.411
Because there's absolutely
nothing you can do to stop him.

13:54.479 --> 13:58.230
So enjoy your final days of freedom.

13:58.691 --> 14:02.355
Yeah, Peter, it's done.
Tell the president.

14:06.325 --> 14:09.821
Three months of work gone in an instant.

14:10.128 --> 14:11.485
We never stood a chance.

14:11.602 --> 14:13.290
Clay: This is not over.

14:13.438 --> 14:14.831
We've just been going about it
the wrong way...

14:14.900 --> 14:17.634
head-on, trying to block the
Collaborators' paths the entire time.

14:17.736 --> 14:20.036
- As opposed to what?
- Blowing up the whole road.

14:20.138 --> 14:21.671
How do we do that
when we're out of time?

14:21.740 --> 14:24.441
Find a time machine and go
back and use Theo's technology

14:24.543 --> 14:26.576
against the Collaborators
to find their plan first?

14:26.645 --> 14:28.812
We don't need a time machine to
do that. We can do it right now.

14:28.914 --> 14:32.541
Theo uses technology to spy,
to control people down the line.

14:32.642 --> 14:34.153
He can listen to anybody at any time.

14:34.286 --> 14:35.719
So, why would a guy like that play fair

14:35.754 --> 14:37.220
when it comes to his
fellow Collaborators?

14:37.322 --> 14:38.522
You think he's spying on them.

14:38.557 --> 14:40.056
I think he's got to
have enough dirt on Roarke

14:40.158 --> 14:41.391
to bury him 10 times over.

14:42.208 --> 14:44.060
The intelligence we gathered
on the Collaborators

14:44.129 --> 14:45.362
wasn't enough to get them.

14:45.464 --> 14:47.297
But if we can get whatever
Peter Theo has on them...

14:47.399 --> 14:50.300
It is still us against the
most powerful man in America.

14:50.402 --> 14:52.769
We are not the only group
who can use that intelligence.

14:52.871 --> 14:53.871
What are you thinking?

14:53.905 --> 14:55.425
Something that isn't just a roadblock.

14:55.474 --> 14:58.289
Something that might just
get us all killed.

14:58.516 --> 15:00.143
But we're gonna need reinforcements.

15:00.313 --> 15:01.778
I think I know who to call.

15:03.315 --> 15:04.595
What do you want me to tell him?

15:05.084 --> 15:07.350
Tell him we're gonna betray our country.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.901
[Indistinct conversations,

15:21.003 --> 15:23.425
I don't drink, either.

15:23.683 --> 15:26.307
I never saw the point of paying $14

15:26.390 --> 15:28.632
for two ounces of flavored ethanol.

15:32.114 --> 15:33.941
Don't drink?

15:34.083 --> 15:36.269
You don't hear that a lot in a gay bar.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.652
I wouldn't know. It's my first time.

15:40.888 --> 15:42.223
Peter.

15:42.544 --> 15:44.669
Oh, I'm straight.
I'm here with my girlfriend.

15:44.739 --> 15:46.862
- She likes to dance.
- Jimmy!

15:47.812 --> 15:51.382
- Did you make a friend?
- Just killing some time, Karen.

15:51.836 --> 15:54.938
Hands off, mister. He's mine.

15:55.586 --> 15:58.089
But isn't he the cutest?

15:58.307 --> 16:01.456
Look at that. He thinks so, too.

16:04.947 --> 16:06.280
I'll leave you two alone.

16:06.573 --> 16:08.182
You don't have to.

16:08.251 --> 16:09.917

so we can link up.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.050
If we meet the Russians empty-handed...

16:36.183 --> 16:38.050
We didn't have time to run
the missions back-to-back.

16:38.152 --> 16:39.851
We're on parallel tracks here.
It's gonna be fine.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.386
Look, we're just here
to give the Russians access

16:41.488 --> 16:44.323
- to Peter Theo's database.
- That's it? Just access?

16:44.476 --> 16:47.044
With Peter Theo's intel
on your former boss,

16:47.130 --> 16:49.239
combined with whatever FSB has on him,

16:49.333 --> 16:51.563
the Russians can easily
compromise the president,

16:51.731 --> 16:53.332
and he won't even see it coming.

16:53.434 --> 16:57.044
And once it's done,
he won't be able to get out.

16:57.338 --> 16:59.190
Since my life is on the line,
I just have to know...

16:59.455 --> 17:01.013
what are the Russians
giving you for this?

17:01.041 --> 17:02.869
They're not giving us anything.

17:03.210 --> 17:05.071
We're using them to take Roarke out.

17:05.329 --> 17:08.078
How can you be so sure
this will work, huh?

17:08.214 --> 17:10.164
The Russians could do anything
with that intelligence.

17:10.273 --> 17:11.450
I know you're scared.

17:11.518 --> 17:13.126
And I know I don't have a right
to ask you to do this.

17:13.196 --> 17:15.654
That's right. You don't.
Okay? You don't.

17:15.723 --> 17:17.489
I will do it because
it's the right thing to do

17:17.558 --> 17:19.826
and because that's what
friends do for each other.

17:22.329 --> 17:24.923

You're good to go.

Is that so?

17:31.972 --> 17:33.972
Yeah. We take care of each other.

[Laughs] No. That's...
That's not what this is about.

Come on, man.

Take it from someone
who notices these things...

17:46.553 --> 17:50.856

looking at you and no one else.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.825
We're people. We're not a light switch.
You can't just flick us on again.

17:53.927 --> 17:55.393

you're gonna find the time
and space to ask the question.

17:58.225 --> 18:00.232
And I'm pretty sure how she'll answer.

18:01.268 --> 18:03.101
All right. We're here.

18:31.565 --> 18:34.238
We have intelligence on our
president that you might want.

18:34.501 --> 18:36.660
We'll give it to you, but at a price.

18:36.863 --> 18:40.886
Why not use it yourself if it
compromises your president?

18:40.956 --> 18:43.642
- You can write your own check.
- We're just rogue agents.

- It's all explained in this.

You get the president to propose
a change in the language

under debate tomorrow

18:57.458 --> 18:59.649

18:59.868 --> 19:01.034
It's a small change,

stand to gain from it.
