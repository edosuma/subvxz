00:02.253 --> 00:03.584
Beth's voice:
Hey.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.255
I know it's been a while.

00:05.423 --> 00:07.459
I'm gonna be honest,

00:07.633 --> 00:09.715
| forgot about you.

00:10.887 --> 00:13.503
After the farm,
we were always moving.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.013
But something happened.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.049
Something good.

00:18.227 --> 00:20.718
Finally.

00:20.897 --> 00:22.353
We found a prison.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.850
Daddy thinks that we can
make it into a home.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.862
(snarling )

00:32.658 --> 00:34.910
He says we can grow crops
in the field,

00:35.077 --> 00:37.284
find pigs and chickens,

00:37.455 --> 00:40.538
stop running,
stop scavenging.

00:44.629 --> 00:46.665
Lori's baby
is just about due.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.751
She'll need a safe place
when it comes.

00:52.637 --> 00:54.252
(walker snarling )

00:54.430 --> 00:56.216
(gun clicks)

01:04.482 --> 01:06.643
The rest of us,

01:06.817 --> 01:09.559
we just need
a safe place to be.

01:14.450 --> 01:17.817
lwoke up in my own bed
yesterday.

01:17.995 --> 01:21.533
My own bed
in my own room.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.914
But I've been keeping
my bag packed.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.911
Keeping my gun close.

01:28.089 --> 01:30.205
I've been afraid
to get my hopes up

01:30.383 --> 01:32.715
thinking we can
actually stay here.

01:34.679 --> 01:37.261
The thing is,
I've been starting to get afraid

01:37.431 --> 01:40.889
that it's easier
just to be afraid.

01:43.980 --> 01:47.268
But this morning
Daddy said something.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.899
If you don't have hope,
what's the point of living?

01:51.070 --> 01:53.026
( panting )

01:53.197 --> 01:56.735
So I unpacked my bag
and I found you.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.525
So I'm gonna start
writing in you again.

01:59.704 --> 02:01.365
And I'm gonna write
this down now

02:01.539 --> 02:03.621
because you should write
down wishes

02:03.791 --> 02:06.373
to make them come true.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.705
We can live here.

02:10.506 --> 02:13.498
We can live here
for the rest of our lives.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.797
(theme music playing )

02:59.430 --> 03:01.341
We should do something.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.726
We should do something.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.942
We aren't
the only survivors.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.898
We can't be.

03:18.616 --> 03:21.028
Rick, Michonne,
they could be out here.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.944
Maggie and Glenn could have made it
out of A block.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.658
They could've.

03:35.341 --> 03:38.833
You're a tracker.
You can track.

03:39.011 --> 03:41.673
Come on.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.463
The sun will be up soon.
If we head out now, we can--

03:48.979 --> 03:51.971
Fine. If you won't
track, lwill.

04:14.922 --> 04:18.130
( birds screeching )

04:40.531 --> 04:42.692
( blows)

04:42.867 --> 04:46.451
Could be Luke's.
Or Molly's.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.736
Whoever they are,
it means they're alive.

04:48.914 --> 04:53.123
No. This means they were alive
four or five hours ago.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.080
They're alive.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.194
They picked up
the pace right here.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.749
Got out in a hurry.

05:32.917 --> 05:35.283
Things went bad.

05:35.461 --> 05:37.747
Wouldn't kill you
to have a little faith.

05:37.922 --> 05:41.085
Yeah, faith.
Faith ain't done shit for us.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.045
Sure as hell didn't do
nothing for your father.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.906
They'll be hungry
when we find them.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.214
(sighs)

06:56.959 --> 06:58.790
What?

06:58.961 --> 07:00.622
That ain't
walker blood.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.629
The trail keeps going.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.539
They fought them off.

07:06.885 --> 07:10.343
No. Got walker tracks
all up and down here.

07:10.514 --> 07:13.005
At least a dozen of them.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.344
( twig snaps )

07:24.111 --> 07:26.773
- ( snarling )
- ( gasping )

07:40.127 --> 07:42.539
( panting )

07:51.805 --> 07:53.306
Come on.

08:43.232 --> 08:46.269
(flies buzzing )

08:56.704 --> 08:59.286
( Beth crying )

09:32.614 --> 09:34.821
Beth's voice:
We're not gonna die.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.199
None of us.

09:40.164 --> 09:42.200
I believe now.

09:42.374 --> 09:45.332
I believe for Daddy.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.413
If this doesn't work,

09:47.588 --> 09:50.295
I don't know how
I could keep going.

09:58.724 --> 10:01.090
(crying)

10:04.188 --> 10:05.769
Don't cry.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.356
I want Carol.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.687
Well, she's not here.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.021
Here, put this
on your belt.

10:18.786 --> 10:22.199
It's gonna get dark soon.
Where are we going?

10:26.043 --> 10:28.705
Fanhen
Comeon.

10:30.798 --> 10:33.039
ls everybody dead?

10:59.743 --> 11:02.530
- ( crying )
- They're gonna hear her.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.576
We shouldn't be out here.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.163
We'll find a safe
place soon.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.043
We will.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.343
Here.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.880
(crying stops)

11:26.603 --> 11:28.309
-( leaves rustling )
- Walkers!

11:33.777 --> 11:35.438
Here, come on.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.228
Let's go.
It's okay.

11:38.407 --> 11:41.023
I'll find you
something to eat.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.112
All right, go.

11:49.585 --> 11:52.668
(Judith crying)

11:52.838 --> 11:55.204
Look, grapes.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.293
It's okay.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.630
- Can we eat them?
- Yeah, they're good.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.758
Here, Lizzie,
have some.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.309
Shh.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.314
- Come on, baby girl.
- ( fussing )

12:15.485 --> 12:17.441
Shh.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.947
Lizzie, hand me a diaper.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.028
- ( crying )
- It's okay. All right.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.533
Bear with me, Judith.

12:25.704 --> 12:29.117
Okay, that's it.
Okay.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.534
Mica:
They're gonna hear her.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.077
(crying continues)

12:35.255 --> 12:38.167
You're all right.
Come on.

12:38.342 --> 12:41.425
It's all right.
I know. I know.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.836
All right,
what do you want?

12:44.014 --> 12:46.300
What do you want, hmm?

12:46.475 --> 12:50.343
Shh. Shh.
Okay, come on.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.772
- Shh.
-( leaves rustling )

12:52.940 --> 12:55.397
- They're coming!
- Ah! I heard it, Mica!

12:55.567 --> 12:57.603
Don't yell at her.
She doesn't understand walkers.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.860
You're the one who
doesn't understand them.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.400
Come on.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.189
Watch the baby.

13:04.368 --> 13:06.359
(crying continues)

13:16.004 --> 13:18.541
- ( wings flapping )
- ( gasps )

13:20.550 --> 13:22.381
Mica!

13:23.512 --> 13:25.377
Mica!

13:27.683 --> 13:29.344
Mica!

13:32.896 --> 13:34.682
- Tyreese: Mica.
- She's gone.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.471
You yelled at her
and now she's gone.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.766
Mica.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.311
Mica.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.411
Are you okay?

13:48.578 --> 13:50.660
I got scared.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.163
That's okay.
We all get scared.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.369
You did the right thing
running.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.080
- What?
- She did.

13:57.254 --> 13:59.415
You hear or see
a walker, you run.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.250
But when you're
in a group,

14:01.425 --> 14:03.916
you got to try to stay
close to them, okay?

14:08.181 --> 14:11.139
You're bleeding.
Did I hurt your arm bad?

14:11.309 --> 14:13.971
It was a lot worse
at the prison. No big.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.187
I'm sorry.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.894
I know I'm not
like Lizzie.

14:20.068 --> 14:23.276
Don't be sorry.
You each do things your own way.

14:23.447 --> 14:26.154
- But you both get it done.
- Like you and Sasha?

14:26.324 --> 14:27.700
You're not like Sasha.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.278
Why not?

14:29.453 --> 14:30.784
Because you're
still here.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.455
Sasha isn't.

14:33.749 --> 14:36.206
(woman screaming )

14:39.296 --> 14:41.582
- Here.
- What are you doing?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.130
Come on.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.542
I'm making sure you can see
in both directions.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.132
You stay like this
and keep watch.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.297
- You're leaving us?
- ( woman screams )

14:51.475 --> 14:53.181
They may be
from the prison.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.558
- I need to help them.
- We need you.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.391
Mica, tuck your shirt
behind your knife

14:58.565 --> 15:00.271
so it's easier to grab.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.978
- We'll be okay.
- Okay.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.983
(woman screams )

15:05.655 --> 15:07.316
What do you do
when you see a walker?

15:07.491 --> 15:08.901
- Run.
- Run.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.988
Together, towards me.
Only fire if you have to.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.870
Please, please don't go.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.291
Mica, look at me.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.544
You can handle this.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.705
You're tough.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.173
(woman screams )

15:38.522 --> 15:40.683
(walkers snarling )

15:45.237 --> 15:48.149
- Chris, head for the woods.
- I can't.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.498
(Judith crying)

16:03.588 --> 16:06.500
Come on, Judith.
Be quiet.

16:06.675 --> 16:10.338
She's not stopping.
Please, Lizzie, do something.

16:10.512 --> 16:13.345
They're gonna hear us.

16:14.391 --> 16:17.554
- Shh.
- ( muffled crying )

16:28.071 --> 16:29.857
( leaves rustling )

16:30.031 --> 16:32.022
(snarling )

16:32.200 --> 16:34.282
Lizzie.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.578
- Ah! Dad!
- Christopher!

16:39.583 --> 16:41.164
- Dad!
- Christopher!

16:50.635 --> 16:52.546
( Mica muffled )
Lizzie, we have to run.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.336
(Judith crying, muffled)

16:54.514 --> 16:56.254
Mica:
Lizzie?

16:57.809 --> 16:59.049
Lizzie.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.267
(gunshot)

17:18.788 --> 17:21.279
- Watch out!
- ( screams )

17:32.510 --> 17:34.501
Carol:
Tyreese.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.770
How-- how...

17:53.740 --> 17:55.446
How'd you find us?

17:55.617 --> 17:57.573
Where were you?
How'd you--

17:57.744 --> 18:00.156
(man sobbing )

18:00.330 --> 18:02.412
Stay here, girls.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.421
Stay on the tracks.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.220
That was my mistake.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.347
But the woods have
more cover.

18:21.518 --> 18:24.885
No, you don't
understand.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.930
There's a place
up the tracks.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.600
It's safe.
You can take the children there.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.942
Trust me.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.358
Please.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.572
Follow the tracks.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.381
(sobbing )

19:02.475 --> 19:04.682
Ty reese.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.718
ldidn't run.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.852
I didn't leave Lizzie.

19:09.024 --> 19:11.731
See that?
Tough little lady.

19:13.236 --> 19:18.196
Hey, there's some
water in there.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.607
- And some food.
- Yeah.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.904
Here you go.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.582
Here you go.
Here you go.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.662
I didn't see
you get out.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.081
I thought you--

19:36.259 --> 19:38.591
I wasn't there.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.720
lhadnt
gotten back yet.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.221
Rick and I found a car.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.427
He took what we had
back to the prison

19:45.602 --> 19:48.093
while I...

19:48.271 --> 19:49.932
kept looking.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.809
Did you see it?

19:52.984 --> 19:55.521
I saw the end.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.311
And then...

19:58.490 --> 20:00.446
I saw you running
into the woods.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.107
You were far away.
I lost you, but...

20:02.285 --> 20:04.992
You found us.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.456
I knew you would.

20:14.464 --> 20:18.127
Hey, maybe we can circle
back and find your car.

20:19.511 --> 20:22.173
The walkers
and the fire--

20:22.347 --> 20:24.838
you can't go back
to a graveyard.

20:34.317 --> 20:35.978
Look.

20:43.368 --> 20:46.826
"Sanctuary for all.
Community for all.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.829
Those who arrive
survive."

21:17.652 --> 21:21.270
( knife scraping )

21:21.448 --> 21:23.655
(fabric ripping )

21:30.415 --> 21:32.371
Sorry.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.872
You can smile.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.332
You're alive.
I get it.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.925
That's not it.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.553
Okay.

21:50.018 --> 21:52.384
Tyreese could have
made it, Sasha.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.517
We don't know
if anybody got out.

22:00.445 --> 22:02.401
No.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.488
We do.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.169
How's he doing?

22:17.337 --> 22:20.079
Bleeding stopped.
He'll be all right.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.753
Got the water
to our backs.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.293
Decent vantage points
from the bank.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.257
I'm thinking we camp
here for the night.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.422
That's good.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.594
You should both
be safe here.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.683
The bus got out.
Glenn got out.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.189
- I'm gonna find him.
- Maggie.

22:41.611 --> 22:44.068
With any luck,
the bus is gone.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.605
It was heading east down the main road.
If I follow in that direction,

22:46.783 --> 22:49.570
- I might be able to pick up its tracks.
- Alone? With just that?

22:49.744 --> 22:51.780
I'm out of ammo, so, yeah.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.741
I couldn't find Beth.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.997
I know Glenn got out
and I know which way he went.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.704
I'm gonna go get him
and I'm gonna come back for you.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.493
- We both are.
- Sasha: Maggie.

23:00.672 --> 23:03.505
- I'm going.
- We cannot split up. Not now.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.965
I'm going.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.879
You said it.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.810
Sasha:
You could have helped me stop her.

23:27.865 --> 23:30.481
If you're trying to make me
feel sorry for you, it's not working.

23:31.995 --> 23:35.237
Damn, it means I let myself
get shot up for nothing.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.656
The odds of us
finding him...

23:37.834 --> 23:40.826
We should be out
looking for food, shelter.

23:41.004 --> 23:42.494
Yeah, why is that?

23:42.672 --> 23:44.537
So we can live.

23:44.716 --> 23:47.583
- Then what?
- What?

23:47.760 --> 23:50.342
Maybe we didn't survive
just to keep surviving.

23:50.513 --> 23:52.299
Shit happens.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.259
Not everything
has to mean something.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.675
No, it doesn't have to,
but it can.

23:56.853 --> 23:59.560
If you make it that way, and that's
what it seems like we're doing.

23:59.731 --> 24:01.642
And I'm down with that.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.878
Maggie.
Maggie!

24:42.357 --> 24:44.393
(snarling )

24:57.038 --> 24:58.903
You should go.

25:00.541 --> 25:03.078
- Maggie, stop.
- Maggie. Maggie.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.958
l have to know
if he's in there.

25:06.089 --> 25:09.047
Fine, but we
do it together.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.333
Smart.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.131
We'll let them out
one at a time.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.300
Two of us should be
at the door...

25:22.438 --> 25:23.939
in case they stack up
against it.

25:24.107 --> 25:26.189
l have to be here.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.190
I need to see their faces.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.352
-( pounding)
- ( snarling)

26:04.981 --> 26:06.767
( knife thuds)

26:12.488 --> 26:14.649
I can't hold it.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.904
( muffled gunshots,
knife pierces )

26:27.044 --> 26:30.411
(growling)

26:30.590 --> 26:32.080
(gunshot)

26:57.742 --> 26:59.733
I'm sorry.

27:09.670 --> 27:12.002
But they got away.

27:12.173 --> 27:13.959
They were good people.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.545
All of them.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.778
You should let me.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.442
(flies buzzing )

28:10.731 --> 28:13.063
(gurgling)

28:18.406 --> 28:20.863
(snarling )

28:41.804 --> 28:43.840
(growling)

29:04.660 --> 29:07.197
(crying)

29:22.637 --> 29:25.970
(laughing)

29:30.478 --> 29:32.935
(walkers growling )

29:41.405 --> 29:43.191
( groans )

30:07.723 --> 30:09.805
Maggie?

30:14.814 --> 30:16.679
Maggie!

30:40.256 --> 30:42.838
( door squeaks)

31:30.473 --> 31:32.179
( bottle clinks )

31:39.690 --> 31:41.931
(coughs)

32:51.679 --> 32:53.886
(sighs)

33:41.145 --> 33:44.012
(crying)

34:05.920 --> 34:07.831
(sighs)

34:08.005 --> 34:10.462
( sniffles )

35:23.247 --> 35:26.205
(walkers growling )

35:38.387 --> 35:41.550
(Glenn shouting)

35:43.350 --> 35:45.727
(shouts)

35:50.858 --> 35:53.440
( breathing heavily )

36:13.505 --> 36:16.247
(snarling )

36:16.425 --> 36:18.131
( knife pierces )

36:39.573 --> 36:41.814
It's full.

36:41.992 --> 36:44.324
Did you even fire a shot?

36:46.455 --> 36:48.787
All right.
Let's go.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.331
Let's go.

36:54.463 --> 36:56.954
Are you just gonna
stay here, huh?

36:57.132 --> 36:59.919
- You're just gonna die?
- l was part of this.

37:01.178 --> 37:03.294
I know.

37:03.472 --> 37:06.134
So what are you doing?

37:07.393 --> 37:09.475
I need your help.

37:17.653 --> 37:18.859
We're gonna run
out of bullets.

37:19.029 --> 37:21.736
Take this
and take this.

37:26.286 --> 37:28.868
-( lighter clinks)
- Back up.

37:46.682 --> 37:49.549
All right.
I need you to stay ahead of me, okay?

37:49.726 --> 37:52.433
All right.
l'll cover you, but I can't do it alone.

38:01.363 --> 38:03.069
You ready?

38:03.240 --> 38:04.901
Let's go.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.525
Go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

38:10.122 --> 38:12.613
- ( gunshots)
- Shoot! Shoot! Come on!

38:22.342 --> 38:24.378
(gunshot)

38:38.233 --> 38:41.225
( panting )

38:44.323 --> 38:46.314
Did you see if any
of my people got out?

38:46.492 --> 38:49.325
All I saw was my sister
in that field.

38:50.579 --> 38:52.945
She wasn't supposed
to be there.

38:54.249 --> 38:56.706
She had a gun,
but they just swarmed her.

38:59.630 --> 39:01.086
She wasn't
supposed to be there.

39:01.256 --> 39:04.214
I did it for him.
ltrusted him.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.375
And then hejust
killed that old man.

39:07.471 --> 39:09.712
Hershel?

39:14.102 --> 39:16.184
Was his name Hershel?

39:24.530 --> 39:26.441
I'm sorry.

39:26.615 --> 39:28.355
I'm so sorry.

39:31.119 --> 39:34.782
Brian, that man,
told us you were bad people.

39:34.957 --> 39:36.868
I know it's not true.

39:37.042 --> 39:40.500
I can see it's not,
so what we did, what I did...

39:43.215 --> 39:45.547
I mean, I'm a piece
of shit.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.049
Why would you
want my help?

39:50.597 --> 39:53.179
I don't want it,
I need it.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.387
l have to find Maggie.

40:02.859 --> 40:05.020
Who's Maggie?

40:05.195 --> 40:08.028
She's my wife.

40:08.198 --> 40:11.235
You guys got separated?

40:11.410 --> 40:14.072
l was on the bus and then I got off
to help and she didn't see me.

40:14.246 --> 40:17.158
How do you know
if she made it?

40:17.332 --> 40:19.664
I don't know.

40:19.835 --> 40:22.167
But Hershel,

40:22.337 --> 40:24.589
Maggie's father,
was a great man.

40:26.174 --> 40:27.914
And he told me all I had to do
was believe,

40:28.093 --> 40:29.708
and that's what
I'm gonna do.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.968
Neither one of us
should be alive right now.

40:34.016 --> 40:37.554
She got out, so you're gonna
help me find her.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.473
Things aren't over.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.434
They're not over.

40:43.609 --> 40:46.191
I want to believe that.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.646
I want to.

40:52.909 --> 40:55.366
(walkers growling )

41:03.879 --> 41:06.086
You have to.

41:28.070 --> 41:30.106
(gasping )

41:34.534 --> 41:37.321
Glenn.
Glenn.

41:37.496 --> 41:40.408
Hey, Glenn.

41:40.582 --> 41:42.914
(snarling )

41:45.629 --> 41:47.915
(vehicle approaching )

41:57.599 --> 42:00.011
( panting )

42:02.938 --> 42:05.395
Hope you enjoyed
the show, assholes.

42:05.565 --> 42:07.476
( doors open )

42:12.948 --> 42:15.985
You got a damn mouth
on you, you know that?

42:17.994 --> 42:19.950
What else you got?

42:22.999 --> 42:23.078
(theme music playing )

42:23.083 --> 42:25.825
(theme music playing )
