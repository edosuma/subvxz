Previously on <I.Criminal Minds...

00:05.796 --> 00:08.278
Emily this calls for you
from a Sean McAllister

00:08.311 --> 00:10.980
came to my phone accidentally.
It sounded very important.

00:12.048 --> 00:13.449
Sean.

00:13.516 --> 00:14.583
I was gonna call you back.

00:14.651 --> 00:16.452
I just--I got busy
on a case.

00:16.519 --> 00:19.788
Ian Doyle vanished
from prison.

00:20.991 --> 00:22.925
Interpol can't find him.

00:22.993 --> 00:25.127
What are you saying?

00:25.195 --> 00:26.896
He's off the grid, Emily.

00:42.012 --> 00:44.246
Prentiss, what's going on
with you?

00:44.314 --> 00:45.631
I've been watching you
the last couple of days

00:45.715 --> 00:47.783
and something is obviously
bothering you.

00:47.851 --> 00:49.451
Derek, because I like you,

00:49.519 --> 00:51.987
I'm going to ask you
not to do this.

01:07.203 --> 01:09.271
I want to talk to Sean.

01:09.322 --> 01:10.272
They got her.

01:10.323 --> 01:12.408
Drop the phone.
Get on the ground, now.

01:16.947 --> 01:18.047
Am I in danger?

01:18.114 --> 01:19.448
We all are.

01:24.821 --> 01:29.141
Tsia, it's Emily.
Where are you?

01:29.209 --> 01:30.809
Bois du Boulogne.

01:30.894 --> 01:32.761
Well, that's a significant
change of address.

01:32.829 --> 01:34.680
That's not the only change.

01:34.764 --> 01:36.231
I got engaged.

01:36.299 --> 01:40.102
Wow. So you and Jeremy
are gonna...

01:40.153 --> 01:43.188
That's great.
That's great.

01:43.273 --> 01:45.874
Emily, what's wrong?

01:45.942 --> 01:47.826
Have you heard from Sean?

01:47.911 --> 01:50.079
Yes, he's been calling me
for days.

01:50.146 --> 01:52.114
But you haven't
talked to him?

01:52.182 --> 01:54.883
I don't work for him
anymore. I'm out.

01:54.951 --> 01:56.151
So's Doyle.

01:57.854 --> 02:00.255
Sean thinks
we're all in danger.

02:00.323 --> 02:05.060
But I was the only one who had any
personal connection to him.

02:05.128 --> 02:07.463
As far as Doyle
is concerned,

02:07.514 --> 02:09.798
Lauren Reynolds died
in a car accident.

02:09.866 --> 02:11.734
Jeremy and I made sure
of that.

02:11.801 --> 02:13.068
Ok?

02:13.136 --> 02:15.237
I want to hear you
say it.

02:15.305 --> 02:16.238
Go on.

02:16.306 --> 02:19.108
Lauren Reynolds is dead.

02:19.175 --> 02:20.275
Sweetie, trust me.

02:20.343 --> 02:22.895
You died and we're all good.

02:22.979 --> 02:24.246
Ok. Just be careful.

02:24.314 --> 02:26.482
And give Jeremy my love.
Bye.

02:26.533 --> 02:29.234
Who's Lauren Reynolds?

02:29.319 --> 02:31.704
She was a friend of mine.

02:31.788 --> 02:33.706
How did she die?

02:33.790 --> 02:34.707
A car accident.

02:34.791 --> 02:36.291
I'm really sorry.

02:36.359 --> 02:37.493
Good morning.

02:38.962 --> 02:40.746
Let's get started.

02:40.830 --> 02:42.631
Hey.
Thank you all for coming.

02:42.698 --> 02:46.101
And time is of the essence.

02:46.169 --> 02:48.103
Ok. Molly Grandin,
25 years old,

02:48.171 --> 02:49.805
she's been missing
approximately 24 hours.

02:49.873 --> 02:52.975
Her car was found abandoned
in a strip mall parking lot.

02:53.043 --> 02:54.443
Syracuse police chief
just called me to tell me

02:54.511 --> 02:56.311
that 4 months ago another
woman, Gail Langston,

02:56.379 --> 02:57.896
also 25, went missing.

02:57.981 --> 03:01.984
Gail's body washed up
3 days later in Onondaga Lake.

03:02.052 --> 03:04.719
She'd been held captive,
her hands and feet smashed,

03:04.771 --> 03:06.405
and then she was stabbed
to death.

03:06.489 --> 03:09.324
Her car was found in the same
parking lot as Molly Grandin's.

03:09.392 --> 03:12.227
Other than abandoned cars, what makes
them think it's the same offender?

03:12.278 --> 03:14.896
Both women packed a bag
with enough clothes and toiletries

03:14.948 --> 03:16.165
to last them
for the weekend,

03:16.232 --> 03:18.283
and in both cases,
the bags were found

03:18.368 --> 03:20.169
in the car along with their purses
and cell phones.

03:20.236 --> 03:21.970
If the unsub is sticking
to the same M.O.,

03:22.038 --> 03:24.623
then Molly only has
36 hours left.

03:24.707 --> 03:25.740
Let's go.

03:25.792 --> 03:27.943
The plane awaits.

03:29.963 --> 03:31.430
Please!

03:31.514 --> 03:33.265
Please, somebody help me!

03:33.349 --> 03:36.718
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me! Please!

03:36.770 --> 03:38.320
Oh, my God.

03:38.388 --> 03:40.589
Please, somebody help me!

who has outposts in your head."

04:18.536 --> 04:19.903
Sally Kempton.

04:19.971 --> 04:21.637
All right, baby girl.
Keep looking.

04:21.706 --> 04:23.423
Garcia still hasn't
found any overlap

04:23.508 --> 04:25.375
between Molly Grandin
and Gail Langston's lives.

04:25.443 --> 04:26.877
For two girls that
didn't know each other

04:26.944 --> 04:28.578
they had a lot in common.

04:28.646 --> 04:30.647
What's the first thing
that jumps out at you?

04:30.715 --> 04:33.150
Their body types
are both small,

04:33.217 --> 04:35.118
but it's not
just physical.

04:35.186 --> 04:36.653
They both shy away
from the camera

04:36.721 --> 04:38.322
and clearly don't enjoy
being photographed.

04:38.389 --> 04:40.791
Both easily overpowered
and controlled.

04:40.858 --> 04:43.827
Well, at 25 they'd be much older
than most undergrads at S.U.

04:43.895 --> 04:45.429
You know,
their college transcripts

04:45.496 --> 04:47.798
are littered with incompletes
and missed semesters.

04:47.865 --> 04:49.833
Both from blue-collar
backgrounds

04:49.901 --> 04:51.702
with no scholarship.

04:51.753 --> 04:53.036
Must be hard to keep up

04:53.104 --> 04:55.138
while working
a full-time job.

04:55.206 --> 04:56.940
So going to a private school
could have been worth it

04:57.008 --> 04:58.308
for appearances' sake.

04:58.376 --> 04:59.943
If the unsub met them on campus,
he could be another student.

05:00.011 --> 05:02.779
He may not be a student.
He might be an employee.

05:02.847 --> 05:04.314
Janitorial staff, security.

05:04.382 --> 05:06.933
Uses a similar background
to bond with the victims?

05:07.018 --> 05:08.618
They both packed bags

05:08.686 --> 05:10.320
to go away with him
for the weekend.

05:10.388 --> 05:11.955
That trip's romantic.

05:12.023 --> 05:14.458
Yeah, he's not just getting to
know them, he's dating them.

05:14.525 --> 05:16.193
Prentiss,
go to Molly's apartment.

05:16.260 --> 05:17.361
If she knew the abductor,

05:17.428 --> 05:18.695
there might be
evidence there.

05:18.763 --> 05:20.130
Reid and Morgan,
go to the dump site.

05:20.198 --> 05:22.799
But Gail's body was found
almost 4 months ago.

05:22.867 --> 05:24.301
Won't all the evidence
be gone by now?

05:24.369 --> 05:26.536
You can actually find out
a lot about an unsub

05:26.604 --> 05:28.205
by where they choose
to leave their victims.

05:29.574 --> 05:31.141
Yeah, Garcia,
what do you got?

05:31.209 --> 05:34.211
Syracuse Police Chief Barrows brought
a suspect in for questioning

05:34.278 --> 05:37.280
5 minutes ago.
His name is Lyle Donaldson.

05:37.348 --> 05:39.383
Molly's ex-boyfriend.

05:41.386 --> 05:43.887
Donaldson's got a boat.
Fishes twice a month

05:43.954 --> 05:46.490
in the same area where
Gail Langston was found.

05:46.557 --> 05:49.309
He was also a student
in a class with her at S.U.

05:49.394 --> 05:50.811
And he's got
an anger problem.

05:50.895 --> 05:52.145
3 arrests for assault.

05:52.230 --> 05:54.464
Yeah. 2 of them were for
beating up Molly Grandin.

05:59.370 --> 06:01.905
It's gotta be him, right?

06:01.973 --> 06:04.841
It's unusual for serial killers
to go after someone

06:04.909 --> 06:06.777
so easily linked to them,
but we'll see

06:06.844 --> 06:08.195
if he fits the profile.

06:09.197 --> 06:12.516
I didn't know Gail Langston.

06:12.583 --> 06:14.117
Yeah, we had a class together,

06:14.185 --> 06:17.521
but there were like
100 people in it.

06:17.588 --> 06:20.490
I barely went, anyway.

06:22.427 --> 06:24.928
I knew Gail was murdered,
but...

06:24.995 --> 06:27.030
That looks like torture.

06:27.098 --> 06:28.732
My client is sitting here
with you, Agent Rossi.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.634
How could he be off
torturing his ex-girlfriend

06:30.701 --> 06:32.269
at the same time?

06:32.336 --> 06:35.138
Lyle, do you know anyone
with a cabin?

06:35.206 --> 06:37.207
A fishing buddy?

06:37.275 --> 06:40.894
Someplace private
to keep Molly tied up

06:40.978 --> 06:42.512
until you get back?

06:42.580 --> 06:44.581
No. Man, this is insane.

06:44.649 --> 06:47.184
I would never hurt--

06:48.853 --> 06:52.789
Ok, look, I did some things
that I'm not proud of, but--

06:52.857 --> 06:54.291
That's enough.

06:54.358 --> 06:56.560
But I could never do this.

06:56.627 --> 06:58.395
The last time
you beat her up,

06:58.463 --> 06:59.963
did she dump you?

07:00.031 --> 07:02.799
He was arrested but never
formally charged with assault.

07:02.867 --> 07:06.303
Ok, fine. After you
broke Molly's jaw,

07:06.370 --> 07:08.889
did she still
want to date you?

07:08.973 --> 07:12.943
Look, we always managed
to work things out.

07:14.512 --> 07:17.447
But not this time.

07:17.515 --> 07:20.517
She was lying.
She was seeing somebody else.

07:20.585 --> 07:21.618
Who?

07:21.686 --> 07:24.287
I don't know.
But it was obvious.

07:24.355 --> 07:27.824
Molly, she changed.

07:27.892 --> 07:30.961
She changed the way
that she dressed,

07:31.028 --> 07:33.630
and she was going out
to clubs.

07:33.698 --> 07:35.832
When you two
were together,

07:35.900 --> 07:39.336
did you control what she
wore, where she went?

07:40.371 --> 07:44.074
This guy's into
controlling her, too.

07:50.047 --> 07:52.349
You know, a body would be
found here rather quickly,

07:52.416 --> 07:55.435
especially if it wasn't
weighed down.

07:55.503 --> 07:57.237
There was
no postmortem damage

07:57.305 --> 07:59.589
from being tied
to the weights.

07:59.657 --> 08:01.591
Everything else
about Gail's capture

08:01.659 --> 08:02.926
was carefully planned.

08:02.994 --> 08:05.428
It seems unlikely this guy
would just suddenly panic

08:05.496 --> 08:06.763
and lose control.

08:06.831 --> 08:08.265
This guy prioritizes control.

08:08.332 --> 08:10.934
I mean, Gail's body was beaten
in a very specific way--

08:11.002 --> 08:12.469
a mallet to the hands
and feet.

08:12.537 --> 08:13.603
Look at this.

08:13.671 --> 08:16.172
The stab wounds
are parallel to each other.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.774
They look more like
puncture wounds.

08:17.842 --> 08:19.809
The M.E. thinks it's
a Phillips head screwdriver.

08:19.877 --> 08:22.779
Which means he uses tools
instead of traditional weapons.

08:22.847 --> 08:25.448
The wounds definitely
have a purpose.

08:25.516 --> 08:28.485
Did you visit Molly
in the emergency room

08:28.553 --> 08:30.487
about 5 months ago?

08:30.555 --> 08:31.821
Of course I did.

08:31.889 --> 08:34.157
And bought her a car
after that.

08:34.225 --> 08:35.292
Why?

08:35.359 --> 08:37.626
She could have died
in that accident.

08:37.678 --> 08:40.797
Riding a bike around
in this city with the weather?

08:40.865 --> 08:42.799
Too dangerous.

08:42.866 --> 08:46.202
Molly told you she was
in a bike accident?

08:46.270 --> 08:48.471
Yeah.

08:48.539 --> 08:50.373
Yes.

08:50.441 --> 08:53.910
You knew she was in
an abusive relationship.

08:53.978 --> 08:56.079
What she said,
it wasn't like that.

08:56.147 --> 08:58.415
Was she always attracted
to men who hit her?

08:58.482 --> 09:01.351
Molly is not like that.

09:01.419 --> 09:03.169
My daughter's got
all as in school.

09:03.254 --> 09:04.654
She's holding down
a full-time job.

09:04.705 --> 09:07.874
She's gonna
get a degree at S.U.

09:10.661 --> 09:13.797
I never hit my daughter.

09:15.166 --> 09:16.967
Not once.

09:22.773 --> 09:24.574
Thank you.

09:37.855 --> 09:42.492
"Today I do,
tomorrow I will"?

09:43.861 --> 09:45.795
Maybe this guy thought
he was sinking the body

09:45.863 --> 09:47.297
by filling it
with water.

09:47.365 --> 09:49.332
Well, I mean,
at first he'd be right,

09:49.400 --> 09:51.501
but after a few hours, the decaying
tissue would create gas

09:51.569 --> 09:54.104
and the body would
become buoyant.

09:54.171 --> 09:56.773
So this guy wanted
to watch her die,

09:56.841 --> 09:58.341
then sink beneath
the surface.

09:58.409 --> 10:00.844
That sounds like classic
water burial, right?

10:00.911 --> 10:02.979
Well, everything points that way,
except for one thing.

10:03.047 --> 10:06.049
Most water burials are
exclusively done by females.

10:06.117 --> 10:08.585
Until now, victimology,
M.O., and physical abuse

10:08.653 --> 10:10.220
indicated a male offender.

10:11.389 --> 10:13.790
Until now.

10:22.233 --> 10:23.667
Prentiss.

10:23.734 --> 10:26.169
Morgan and I think we might be looking
for a female offender.

10:26.237 --> 10:29.239
That explains why there was no sign
of sexual assault.

10:29.306 --> 10:32.258
With an unsub this obsessed
with control and power,

10:32.343 --> 10:36.179
it's usually
part of the territory.

10:36.247 --> 10:40.183
It looks like there was a female living
in the other bedroom

10:40.251 --> 10:41.685
in Molly's apartment.

10:41.752 --> 10:44.187
We'd have been told
if she had a roommate.

10:44.255 --> 10:47.123
Yeah, so Molly must have
wanted to keep it a secret for a reason.

10:47.191 --> 10:49.425
Whoever she was,

10:49.477 --> 10:51.828
she left recently
and in a hurry.

10:51.896 --> 10:54.898
I'll put a canvass
out now. Thanks, Reid.

10:56.033 --> 10:58.635
So, neighbors did see
a woman coming and going

10:58.703 --> 11:00.987
from Molly's apartment
over the last few months,

11:01.072 --> 11:02.972
but nobody saw her close
enough to get a sketch.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.774
And no one met her?

11:04.825 --> 11:06.309
No. The best
description we got

11:06.377 --> 11:09.379
was white female,
mid-20s, light-brown hair, plain.

11:09.447 --> 11:11.614
Molly never mentioned a roommate
to her father or her coworkers.

11:11.665 --> 11:13.883
Lyle didn't know, either.

11:13.951 --> 11:15.418
Is he still here?

11:15.486 --> 11:17.187
We couldn't charge him,
so his lawyer walked him out.

11:17.254 --> 11:18.521
All right, so we need
to start over, go back over

11:18.589 --> 11:20.657
both Gail and Molly's
cases and look at everything

11:20.725 --> 11:22.392
from the perspective
of a female unsub.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.861
I'll bring in Gail's family and ask
about the women in her life.

11:24.929 --> 11:25.995
Prentiss,
you and Seaver

11:26.063 --> 11:27.480
go back over
to Molly's apartment.

11:27.565 --> 11:29.733
Find out what else
she's hiding.

11:32.570 --> 11:34.838
If you could just
call my father

11:34.905 --> 11:38.007
and make it where he thinks
something happened to me.

11:38.075 --> 11:40.110
Really? Think that through.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.545
Who would I say I was?

11:43.481 --> 11:45.014
I'm not sure.
I don't know.

11:45.082 --> 11:48.084
Well, you've done this
before. I haven't.

11:49.754 --> 11:51.721
Jane?

11:51.789 --> 11:55.158
Don't leave me here, ok?

11:56.360 --> 11:58.194
Come on, Molly.

11:58.262 --> 11:59.996
You gotta relax, Molls.

12:00.064 --> 12:03.366
Trust me, no one looks good when
they're freakin' out.

12:05.102 --> 12:08.004
I'm still shaken up.
I'm sorry.

12:08.072 --> 12:09.472
Move on.

12:09.540 --> 12:12.609
You're grating
when you're anxious.

12:12.676 --> 12:16.813
I woke up terrified. I thought I'd been
kidnapped by some psycho.

12:16.881 --> 12:19.315
What was I supposed to do?

12:22.553 --> 12:24.687
Every day
babies enter the world.

12:24.755 --> 12:27.657
And it's cold and bright
and they're naked.

12:27.725 --> 12:29.926
What do they do?

12:29.994 --> 12:31.060
Cry?

12:31.128 --> 12:33.496
No. They trust.

12:33.564 --> 12:36.166
They cling to
their mother's breast

12:36.233 --> 12:38.067
and accept love.

12:38.135 --> 12:40.003
Right?

12:40.070 --> 12:41.638
Right, yeah.

12:41.705 --> 12:43.439
That's true.

12:43.507 --> 12:45.708
Are you saying

12:45.776 --> 12:48.645
you're my mother
in this exercise?

12:48.712 --> 12:51.648
Uh, no.

12:51.715 --> 12:55.118
We are gonna watch movies,
have girls night, that's all.

12:55.186 --> 12:58.021
Just you, me,
and Julia Roberts.

13:02.193 --> 13:03.743
I'm done with this.

13:03.828 --> 13:06.196
Just untie me.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.498
I...

13:10.734 --> 13:12.969
You spit at me.

13:13.037 --> 13:15.138
I'm feeding you by hand

13:15.206 --> 13:17.774
and you spit at me.

13:18.843 --> 13:20.143
No...

13:20.211 --> 13:23.346
I can't allow you to keep crossing
these boundaries.

13:27.885 --> 13:31.321
I'm gonna help you
fix yourself.

13:31.388 --> 13:35.892
You've become
an ungrateful narcissist.

13:35.943 --> 13:38.528
I call this
a humility check.

13:38.596 --> 13:40.964
It shatters
those selfish thoughts

13:41.031 --> 13:44.400
so you can hear other people's
feelings and needs.

13:44.468 --> 13:47.537
Please, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, please.

13:47.604 --> 13:51.975
I'm sorry. I'm sor--aah!

13:59.460 --> 14:03.547
Today I do, tomorrow I will.

14:05.516 --> 14:08.085
Today I do...

14:08.152 --> 14:10.587
Tomorrow I will.

14:24.118 --> 14:26.936
She was overdosing
on daily affirmations.

14:26.988 --> 14:31.074
Yeah, saying you're happy
isn't the same as being happy.

14:32.076 --> 14:34.461
I got it.

14:36.914 --> 14:38.248
Oh.

14:38.316 --> 14:41.551
I think I found
her dark secret.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.120
And this...

14:44.172 --> 14:47.257
Is a diet journal.

14:47.308 --> 14:49.292
Check with Garcia.

14:49.343 --> 14:52.596
See if her spending
reflects a disorder.

14:52.647 --> 14:53.563
Hey.

14:53.648 --> 14:55.265
Hey. Seaver.
How much money

14:55.333 --> 14:57.300
did Molly spend
on food every week?

14:59.237 --> 15:01.404
30 bucks a week
at the grocery store.

15:01.472 --> 15:03.523
Thai food every Friday.

15:03.608 --> 15:06.710
Yikes, she is worse than me.
$8.00 a day for coffee.

15:06.777 --> 15:08.111
Can you go back
a couple months?

15:08.179 --> 15:09.112
Yeah.

15:09.180 --> 15:10.747
Oh, my.

15:10.815 --> 15:13.250
Back then the spending tells
an entirely different story

15:13.317 --> 15:14.684
of the unhealthy sort.

15:14.752 --> 15:16.720
Lots of drugstore purchases,

15:16.787 --> 15:18.221
fast food places.

15:18.289 --> 15:20.624
Only a few dollars a week
at the grocery.

15:20.691 --> 15:22.092
Carrots and hot sauce.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.394
And then 17 bucks
at McDonald's.

15:24.462 --> 15:26.396
Binge night.

15:26.464 --> 15:27.931
Anything in the journal?

15:27.999 --> 15:30.400
It's intense. She recorded not only
what she put into her body

15:30.468 --> 15:34.170
but what came out.
Calories expended during exercise,

15:34.222 --> 15:36.106
and she weighed
her bowel movements.

15:36.174 --> 15:37.774
Anorexia/bulimia.

15:37.842 --> 15:40.911
The last entry is 10 weeks
before she disappeared.

15:40.978 --> 15:43.380
When did her spending change?

15:43.447 --> 15:45.448
About 3 months ago.

15:45.516 --> 15:47.584
She got a membership
at a yoga studio

15:47.652 --> 15:49.219
and stated paying
for cooking classes.

15:49.287 --> 15:50.420
Thanks.

15:50.488 --> 15:52.923
We need to find out
if Gail Langston

15:52.990 --> 15:55.125
had a similar pattern
before she was killed.

15:55.193 --> 15:57.060
Rossi's speaking
with her family right now.

15:58.129 --> 16:00.564
Did Gail have
many friends?

16:00.631 --> 16:02.966
Oh, Gail never had
a lot of

16:03.034 --> 16:04.901
girlfriends. She...

16:04.969 --> 16:06.770
Believe me,
if she'd met one,

16:06.837 --> 16:08.238
it would have been
big news.

16:08.306 --> 16:09.739
Was she staying
with anyone?

16:09.807 --> 16:12.142
Photos of her apartment
show a roll-out sofa

16:12.210 --> 16:14.010
made up as a bed.

16:14.078 --> 16:15.679
In that little place?

16:15.730 --> 16:17.781
No, absolutely not.

16:17.848 --> 16:21.151
If family came to town,
they stayed at the house.

16:21.219 --> 16:24.721
Were you close
with your sister?

16:26.924 --> 16:28.592
We used to tell each other
everything.

16:28.659 --> 16:30.393
Thick as thieves,
those two.

16:31.395 --> 16:33.363
She was different
in the last few months

16:33.431 --> 16:35.298
before she was murdered.

16:35.366 --> 16:37.167
She got real secretive.

16:37.234 --> 16:39.169
Peter, that makes it
sound so bad.

16:39.237 --> 16:40.937
How else had she changed?

16:41.005 --> 16:42.672
She was a lot better.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.592
She was happier,
more confident.

16:45.676 --> 16:47.644
She went back to school,
finally.

16:47.712 --> 16:49.879
And she was working
really hard.

16:49.947 --> 16:53.316
Why did she take
time off from school?

16:53.384 --> 16:54.801
She wanted to--

16:54.885 --> 16:57.687
she had depression.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.356
Really bad.

16:59.423 --> 17:01.925
She was moody, that's all.

17:03.127 --> 17:05.494
Was she ever treated
for depression?

17:07.114 --> 17:09.633
Once I found her
in the bathtub.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.067
That was an accident.

17:11.135 --> 17:13.670
I took her to the E.R. and they
admitted her to some program.

17:13.738 --> 17:16.306
After that she was ok.

17:16.374 --> 17:19.809
You know, up and down,
but the doctor said that was normal.

17:19.877 --> 17:21.478
Was she seeing
a therapist

17:21.545 --> 17:23.980
or attending
a support group?

17:24.048 --> 17:28.050
She only spoke in terms of
expelling negative thoughts

17:28.118 --> 17:30.086
or visualizing her truth.

17:30.154 --> 17:31.921
She was a lot better.

17:31.989 --> 17:33.657
But she wasn't herself.

17:33.724 --> 17:36.926
What about the phrase,

17:36.994 --> 17:38.361
"today I do,

17:38.429 --> 17:40.180
tomorrow I will"?

17:40.264 --> 17:42.432
That's the one
that she used the most.

17:42.483 --> 17:44.434
And it was working.

18:37.321 --> 18:41.374
You know, this phrase doesn't seem
to have a particular source or author.

18:41.459 --> 18:42.909
It's found in pretty much
every self-help book--

18:42.993 --> 18:44.411
I read 22 of them today--

18:44.495 --> 18:47.097
all touting the same
basic 3-part plan.

18:47.164 --> 18:50.100
Let me guess--
phase one is positive thinking,

18:50.167 --> 18:51.918
visualizing goals.

18:52.002 --> 18:54.704
That's to work up the courage
to get to phase 2--

18:54.755 --> 18:57.540
taking real steps
to achieve said goal.

18:57.608 --> 18:59.309
Gail committed to school,

18:59.376 --> 19:01.778
got grades
like never before.

19:01.846 --> 19:03.546
Molly gave up
her obsessive food journal

19:03.597 --> 19:05.048
and started eating better.

19:05.116 --> 19:07.283
It's hard to believe
motivational sayings alone

19:07.351 --> 19:09.719
would allow her to make
these type of strides.

19:09.787 --> 19:12.555
Maybe that's why the unsub
moved in with them.

19:12.623 --> 19:15.058
She could offer support
and encouragement day and night.

19:15.126 --> 19:17.727
She'd be around
to watch Molly's diet

19:17.795 --> 19:19.429
or Gail's study habits.

19:19.497 --> 19:21.030
At first her methods worked.

19:21.082 --> 19:23.032
She gets to be the hero,
the savior.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.734
She's a pure narcissist,
so helping her victims

19:24.802 --> 19:27.537
is only about gaining
their appreciation and dependence.

19:27.605 --> 19:29.139
The more her victims
gain confidence,

19:29.206 --> 19:31.074
the less they need
a full-time cheerleader.

19:31.142 --> 19:33.810
And that's when her motivational plan
goes completely off the rails.

19:33.878 --> 19:37.247
Phase 3 is normally about maintaining
the tenets of the program independently.

19:37.314 --> 19:40.750
But her program doesn't end.
She holds them captive,

19:40.818 --> 19:42.385
destroys them physically.

19:42.453 --> 19:45.789
She's the motivational
speaker from hell.

19:47.792 --> 19:50.059
What were you doing
on the floor?

19:50.111 --> 19:51.928
Were you trying to walk
all by yourself?

19:51.996 --> 19:53.430
You were gone
a long time.

19:53.497 --> 19:55.899
I had to get supplies
for you.

19:55.966 --> 19:59.202
You don't want to get infected
from old bandages, do you?

19:59.270 --> 20:01.771
Maybe I should go
to a hospital.

20:01.839 --> 20:03.606
Nonsense.

20:03.674 --> 20:06.042
You are not a burden.

20:06.110 --> 20:10.013
I can't walk or go to
the bathroom by myself.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.281
Ah.

20:11.348 --> 20:14.167
That's why
I got you these.

20:14.251 --> 20:16.019
Voila.

20:16.086 --> 20:18.688
You want me
to wear diapers?

20:18.756 --> 20:20.523
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

20:20.591 --> 20:24.027
Just till you get back
on your feet.

20:24.094 --> 20:27.464
I need a doctor,
a real one.

20:27.531 --> 20:29.833
I might have
some painkillers somewhere.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.802
I don't use them because
I prefer to build character.

20:32.870 --> 20:34.671
Jane, I need help.

20:34.738 --> 20:36.906
Please let me
out of here.

20:36.974 --> 20:40.143
I don't want to die
in this room.

20:40.211 --> 20:41.511
Hey, now.

20:41.579 --> 20:43.646
What is all this negativity?

20:43.714 --> 20:46.015
You are gonna be fine.

20:46.083 --> 20:49.052
Taking care of people
is what I do best.

20:49.119 --> 20:51.521
It's my life's calling.

20:51.589 --> 20:54.324
I just want to go home.

20:54.391 --> 20:56.960
You're adorable.

20:57.027 --> 21:00.797
You said yourself, you can't
even walk or go to the bathroom.

21:00.865 --> 21:03.833
The first step is always
admitting we need help.

21:03.901 --> 21:07.270
Next, we visualize.

21:09.306 --> 21:12.475
Imagine you're walking
across this room.

21:12.543 --> 21:14.777
I see it now.

21:14.845 --> 21:16.312
You are doing great.

21:16.380 --> 21:17.614
Halfway there.

21:17.681 --> 21:18.815
Now say it with me.

21:18.883 --> 21:22.085
Today I do, tomorrow I will.

21:22.152 --> 21:23.786
Today I do,

21:23.854 --> 21:25.154
tomorrow I will.

21:25.222 --> 21:26.656
Again.

21:26.724 --> 21:29.626
But this time just
believe it even more.

21:29.693 --> 21:30.793
Today I do,

21:30.861 --> 21:32.095
tomorrow I will.

21:32.162 --> 21:33.296
Great.

21:33.364 --> 21:35.465
We're looking for a white
woman in her mid-20s,

21:35.532 --> 21:37.967
most likely blue collar
and local to the Syracuse area.

21:38.035 --> 21:40.803
She probably has a job
that puts her in the role of caretaker,

21:40.871 --> 21:43.973
such as a masseuse,
a nail or hair stylist, personal trainer.

21:44.041 --> 21:47.143
Women feel comfortable opening up
to her about their personal lives,

21:47.210 --> 21:49.078
revealing details about
their insecurities

21:49.146 --> 21:50.914
that she later uses
to manipulate them.

21:50.981 --> 21:53.583
Do you think she tries
to pass herself off as a therapist

21:53.651 --> 21:55.084
or a counselor
of some sort?

21:55.152 --> 21:56.452
That's doubtful.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.087
Her narcissistic
personality wouldn't allow her

21:58.155 --> 21:59.923
to listen to anything
that didn't revolve around her

21:59.990 --> 22:01.491
for more than a few
minutes at a time.

22:01.559 --> 22:03.960
It's hard to learn anything
when you always need to be the expert.

22:04.028 --> 22:06.596
We don't think she's capable of getting
a degree of any kind.

22:06.664 --> 22:09.432
Wouldn't she need some kind of certification
for the jobs you're talking about?

22:09.500 --> 22:12.268
She would, but she's
a master manipulator.

22:12.336 --> 22:13.770
She probably talked her way
into many jobs

22:13.837 --> 22:15.438
before they realized
her credentials were fake.

22:15.506 --> 22:19.175
So check gyms and spas,
salons, yoga studios

22:19.242 --> 22:20.760
for employees fired
in the last 2 years.

22:20.844 --> 22:22.762
We need to I.D. this woman
as fast as possible

22:22.846 --> 22:25.315
if we want any chance
of finding Molly Grandin alive.

22:27.851 --> 22:33.122
Why didn't you tell us
Molly battled with severe anorexia?

22:33.190 --> 22:34.824
I didn't know.

22:34.892 --> 22:38.294
All right, look, it's not as bad
as you're making it out to be here.

22:38.362 --> 22:39.595
She was always
a chubby kid, right?

22:39.647 --> 22:41.064
She always had to watch
what she ate.

22:41.115 --> 22:42.665
Did she get treatment?

22:42.733 --> 22:45.168
We don't believe
in stuff like that.

22:45.235 --> 22:48.638
We're hard-workers.
We like to solve our own problems.

22:48.706 --> 22:51.941
It's urgent that you tell
me everything that you know.

22:54.912 --> 22:58.631
Mr. Grandin, I'm having
difficulty understanding

22:58.716 --> 23:02.185
why keeping Molly's secrets
is more important than finding her alive.

23:02.252 --> 23:06.556
It's not. She just wouldn't want
anyone knowing her personal problems.

23:06.624 --> 23:09.525
Your daughter is specifically
vulnerable to this suspect

23:09.593 --> 23:11.511
because of her private
emotional issues.

23:11.595 --> 23:13.730
Now, we need to know
as much about Molly

23:13.797 --> 23:16.199
as does the person
who's holding her captive.

23:16.266 --> 23:17.767
So I'm going to ask you
again,

23:17.835 --> 23:21.704
are there any other secrets
you're not sharing with me?

23:23.540 --> 23:26.609
She collapsed
about a year ago.

23:26.677 --> 23:28.778
Malnutrition. Anemia.

23:28.829 --> 23:32.382
She...She wasn't eating.

23:32.449 --> 23:33.783
Did she get treatment?

23:33.851 --> 23:35.151
30 days.

23:35.219 --> 23:38.388
Uh, Finley Center
for Eating Disorders.

23:38.455 --> 23:39.789
At Syracuse General.

23:39.857 --> 23:41.691
Yeah.

23:41.759 --> 23:43.226
Why?

23:43.293 --> 23:46.929
Gail Langston was treated there
for depression.

23:48.399 --> 23:50.733
I should have told you.

23:55.706 --> 23:57.240
Yeah.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.619
Fantastic.
I'm so impressed.

24:09.687 --> 24:12.922
Now you'll appreciate
every step you take,

24:12.990 --> 24:14.590
because you earned it.

24:14.658 --> 24:18.661
So, uh, where are you
on your positivity spectrum?

24:18.729 --> 24:19.996
A 4.

24:23.333 --> 24:25.101
No, I mean a 9.

24:25.169 --> 24:26.419
I don't buy it.

24:26.503 --> 24:28.571
Your mind is somewhere else.

24:28.639 --> 24:30.506
No, I'm right here
with you.

24:30.574 --> 24:33.676
You're thinking about Lyle
again, aren't you?

24:33.744 --> 24:36.112
No, I--I'm done with him.

24:36.180 --> 24:37.730
Not even gonna be friends.

24:37.815 --> 24:40.450
Really?

24:40.517 --> 24:43.386
I'm...I'm so proud of you.

24:43.454 --> 24:46.789
Don't be. He's the one
who ended it.

24:46.857 --> 24:48.091
Oh.

24:48.158 --> 24:50.560
I bet that makes you
want him now more than ever.

24:53.063 --> 24:55.665
How many times did you promise
me you wouldn't see him,

24:55.732 --> 24:58.567
then you did,
sneaking around and lying?

24:58.619 --> 25:00.753
Let's not fight about Lyle.
Why don't we watch a movie?

25:00.838 --> 25:03.072
How many times does he have to
put you in the hospital

25:03.123 --> 25:05.141
before you realize
he'll never change?

25:05.209 --> 25:07.677
He doesn't care
about your feelings.

25:07.744 --> 25:09.411
I know.

25:09.463 --> 25:12.749
No, you don't! I am trying
to save you from yourself.

25:12.816 --> 25:14.767
Now, conversation
clearly does not help you.

25:14.852 --> 25:17.920
I am done talking.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.660
Garcia, both families released their
daughters' medical records.

25:24.728 --> 25:26.963
Have you gotten access
to those yet?

25:27.030 --> 25:29.332
Yes. Both women went
to the same hospital

25:29.399 --> 25:31.100
but for different programs
and at different times.

25:31.151 --> 25:33.136
Maybe the unsub
works at the hospital?

25:33.203 --> 25:35.104
Even if she conned her way
into a job,

25:35.172 --> 25:37.774
I doubt she'd last long enough
to get close to patient files.

25:37.841 --> 25:39.208
We were off on our profile.

25:39.276 --> 25:41.110
She doesn't find her victims
by chance like we thought.

25:41.161 --> 25:42.178
She hunts them.

25:42.246 --> 25:44.180
Garcia, does
Syracuse General

25:44.248 --> 25:46.783
keep their surveillance footage
of the entrances and exits?

25:46.850 --> 25:49.018
Oh, in this age of black market
pharmaceutical drug trade,

25:49.086 --> 25:50.837
you betcha.
I can get you that.

25:51.922 --> 25:53.589
Excuse me.

25:58.461 --> 25:59.562
Tsia?

25:59.629 --> 26:01.397
He's gone.

26:01.465 --> 26:04.033
Who? What's going on?

26:04.101 --> 26:05.735
Jeremy's dead.

26:05.803 --> 26:07.937
What?

26:08.005 --> 26:11.240
I got home from work
and he was just lying there.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.810
He'd been in the shower.

26:13.877 --> 26:15.695
I don't know.
I couldn't see anything.

26:15.779 --> 26:17.513
They think it was a clot.

26:17.581 --> 26:20.666
He's not even 40.
How could--

26:20.751 --> 26:22.585
he didn't have a pulse,
so I called the ambulance.

26:22.653 --> 26:24.837
They tried to revive him,
but...

26:24.922 --> 26:27.423
Did somebody break in?

26:27.491 --> 26:29.258
Uh--I don't think so.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.727
Look--look, he was
out for his run.

26:31.795 --> 26:33.763
He's training
for a marathon.

26:33.831 --> 26:35.565
Was it his usual path?

26:35.632 --> 26:36.566
Yes.

26:36.633 --> 26:38.968
But he came back early.

26:39.036 --> 26:43.372
He...He called me, said
he wasn't feeling well.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.558
Did he fall down
on the path?

26:45.642 --> 26:47.977
Did anyone run into him?

26:50.314 --> 26:51.614
Oh, God.

26:51.681 --> 26:54.367
How long have we been talking?

26:54.451 --> 26:56.052
You've got to get out
of there.

26:56.119 --> 26:59.088
Get a flight. Leave France,
get back to America.

26:59.156 --> 27:00.873
Cash transactions only
from here on out.

27:00.958 --> 27:02.725
Am I clear?

27:02.793 --> 27:04.293
It's him, isn't it?

27:04.361 --> 27:05.895
It's Doyle.

27:05.963 --> 27:08.764
Toss that cell phone
and get home safely.

27:18.258 --> 27:19.709
Oh, thanks, hon.

27:22.179 --> 27:24.931
I can't believe you got
my favorite beer.

27:25.015 --> 27:27.733
Now, Molly and Gail
had different doctors,

27:27.818 --> 27:30.353
but both went to Syracuse
General pharmacy.

27:30.404 --> 27:32.355
Assuming they were stalked,
you know, 10 to 14 weeks

27:32.422 --> 27:34.690
before their disappearance,
I went ahead and started

27:34.741 --> 27:37.593
with footage from when
they went to get refills,

27:37.661 --> 27:39.829
which falls right into
that time window.

27:39.897 --> 27:43.366
Behold--Gail Langston,
July 3rd.

27:43.417 --> 27:44.767
See that woman
a few steps behind her

27:44.835 --> 27:46.869
with the large cup of coffee?

27:46.937 --> 27:49.438
Check this out.

27:49.506 --> 27:51.474
A few weeks later,
there she is again.

27:51.541 --> 27:53.209
The same woman
is following her.

27:53.277 --> 27:54.877
Creepy.

27:54.945 --> 27:57.613
She's wearing the same
scarf as Gail.

27:59.616 --> 28:01.050
Turn that up.

28:01.101 --> 28:03.886
Garcia, did this woman
follow a similar pattern

28:03.954 --> 28:05.688
when she was stalking Molly?

28:05.756 --> 28:09.058
Emily, you're totally
ruining the ending.

28:09.109 --> 28:12.228
Here's Molly and the stalker
on November 8th.

28:12.279 --> 28:15.064
What do you know?
She went shopping.

28:15.132 --> 28:16.999
They're carrying
identical purses.

28:17.067 --> 28:20.403
And then 15 minutes
later on their way out.

28:20.470 --> 28:22.371
So she stalks them,
copies them,

28:22.439 --> 28:24.340
and uses it to strike up
a conversation.

28:24.408 --> 28:25.508
Oh, my God.

28:25.575 --> 28:29.378
This is the best damn
bootleg that rush ever did.

28:29.446 --> 28:32.732
Here is a nice clean one
of our stalker lady person.

28:32.799 --> 28:35.084
Ok, now, can you blow
that up and print it?

28:35.152 --> 28:37.453
Yeah. I'm doing it
as we speak.

28:38.655 --> 28:41.090
How did you know
this was my favorite?

28:41.141 --> 28:42.758
I didn't.

28:42.826 --> 28:45.928
I guess we just have
a lot in common.

28:52.629 --> 28:54.682
Gail Langston's family says
they've never seen her before.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.473
Molly's father
said the same thing.

28:57.264 --> 28:58.648
I sent the picture
to Lyle's lawyer,

28:58.716 --> 29:00.166
but he says
he can't find him.

29:00.762 --> 29:01.930
Roommates haven't seen him

29:01.973 --> 29:03.356
since he left here
yesterday.

29:03.649 --> 29:04.649
Where's his car?

29:04.700 --> 29:05.900
Also missing.

29:05.985 --> 29:09.187
Put out an APB for Lyle Donaldson
and the vehicle.

29:13.993 --> 29:17.529
Oh, man. The whole
room is spinning.

29:17.596 --> 29:18.530
It does that.

29:20.266 --> 29:22.367
Hey.

29:24.170 --> 29:28.039
Come on, baby,
I gotta take a leak.

29:28.090 --> 29:30.442
I bet. You drank
like a fiend.

29:32.178 --> 29:33.978
What's wrong, now?

29:35.181 --> 29:37.599
Nothing.

29:37.683 --> 29:39.117
Everything's perfect.

29:39.185 --> 29:43.438
You did exactly what
I figured you'd do.

29:45.157 --> 29:47.659
I told Molly the truth about you
a million times,

29:47.726 --> 29:51.446
but she couldn't get it
through her thick skull.

29:51.530 --> 29:53.832
She's a visual learner,
I guess.

29:53.899 --> 29:55.783
Wait.

29:55.868 --> 29:57.302
How do you know Molly?

29:57.369 --> 29:59.137
God, you're stupid.

30:00.623 --> 30:04.142
Hey--hey, do you know
where Molly is right now?

30:04.210 --> 30:05.977
Of course I do.

30:06.045 --> 30:08.012
I actually care about her.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.948
You are a cancer.

30:10.015 --> 30:13.768
But luckily,
I found a cure.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.136
Hey!

30:15.221 --> 30:16.521
Hey!

30:18.090 --> 30:20.608
Barrows found Lyle's car
in the same parking lot

30:20.693 --> 30:21.976
where Molly and Gail's
cars were found.

30:22.061 --> 30:23.594
She's got him, too.

30:23.646 --> 30:26.481
She's too obsessed with power
and control to work with anyone,

30:26.549 --> 30:27.832
especially
somebody like Lyle.

30:27.900 --> 30:29.300
He's dominating
and violent, just like her.

30:29.368 --> 30:30.969
If anything, she sees him
as a threat.

30:31.036 --> 30:33.571
But why take him now,
with all this heat?

30:33.639 --> 30:35.373
She's not done
with Molly yet.

30:43.966 --> 30:46.351
I have a surprise for you.

30:46.418 --> 30:47.919
You gonna let me
go outside?

30:47.953 --> 30:50.054
Even better.

30:53.592 --> 30:56.895
I am gonna set you free.

31:01.066 --> 31:02.967
Mmm.

31:03.018 --> 31:06.404
This bootleg is amazing.

31:06.471 --> 31:08.907
Come here.

31:08.974 --> 31:10.975
Uh-huh?
Yeah.

31:11.043 --> 31:12.410
Mmm...

31:15.648 --> 31:17.315
Feel good?

31:17.366 --> 31:18.316
It feels great.

31:18.384 --> 31:19.717
Do I make you feel good?

31:19.785 --> 31:21.819
You make me feel...

31:21.887 --> 31:24.222
Ohh...

31:24.290 --> 31:26.558
Ohh! I like that.

31:26.625 --> 31:28.927
Ha ha! Ahh!

31:28.994 --> 31:30.328
You're good.

31:30.396 --> 31:31.462
Come here.

31:33.966 --> 31:35.883
Ahh.

31:39.605 --> 31:41.205
Best I ever had.

31:41.273 --> 31:42.941
Ohh...

31:43.008 --> 31:47.178
Garcia, Dr. Weingold at Syracuse General
sent us an extensive list

31:47.246 --> 31:50.248
of female patients in their mid-20s
that match our profile.

31:50.316 --> 31:53.384
She's most likely local, raised by
a single parent or in foster care.

31:53.452 --> 31:55.954
Ok, narrowing it down.

31:56.021 --> 31:58.022
This unsub likes
familiar places.

31:58.073 --> 32:00.224
Look for extended family
or previous addresses.

32:00.292 --> 32:02.560
Did any of them grow up
near Onondaga Lake?

32:02.628 --> 32:04.696
Ok. Wait, wait.
Here's one that might fit.

32:04.763 --> 32:06.097
Jane Gould.

32:06.165 --> 32:08.266
Her grandparents
had a house near Maple Bay,

32:08.334 --> 32:10.435
which is where Gail's body
was found.

32:10.502 --> 32:12.754
Are they still alive?

32:12.838 --> 32:14.472
No. They died when Jane
was in middle school.

32:14.540 --> 32:16.174
Is the grandparents' house
currently occupied?

32:16.241 --> 32:17.475
Yeah. Water and power
all paid up.

32:17.542 --> 32:18.977
That's the one place
she got attention

32:19.044 --> 32:20.612
from a parental figure.
She feels at home and in charge there.

32:20.679 --> 32:23.314
I'll send you an address.
I'm calling up her photo right now.

32:23.382 --> 32:24.782
Hold on. Oh, lord.
Oh, lord.

32:24.850 --> 32:26.985
This is her.
This is the creepy stalker woman

32:27.052 --> 32:28.486
from the surveillance video.

32:36.228 --> 32:37.962
I know.

32:38.030 --> 32:40.431
It hurts.

32:40.499 --> 32:43.568
Lyle didn't even care
that you were missing.

32:45.537 --> 32:47.372
How low do you have to be

32:47.423 --> 32:50.208
to let a loser
like that hit you?

32:50.275 --> 32:52.443
Very.

32:52.511 --> 32:56.047
Very low.

32:56.115 --> 32:57.682
Do you see now?

32:59.718 --> 33:02.153
See what?

33:02.221 --> 33:05.523
That you deserve better.

33:06.692 --> 33:09.293
It's not that
I deserve better.

33:09.361 --> 33:11.195
I am better.

33:12.865 --> 33:14.399
Than who?

33:17.069 --> 33:19.170
Than you.

33:19.238 --> 33:21.456
And Lyle.

33:22.574 --> 33:24.492
Molly!

33:24.576 --> 33:25.877
Molly!

33:38.390 --> 33:40.558
You're a perfect match.

33:40.626 --> 33:42.360
Why did I not see that?

33:43.729 --> 33:46.364
Are you mad about
the sex tape?

33:46.432 --> 33:48.933
You know I did it
to help you.

33:52.404 --> 33:54.839
I don't care
why you did it.

33:54.907 --> 33:57.442
That's your problem.

33:57.493 --> 34:00.111
You're in denial, Molls.

34:00.179 --> 34:01.779
Take a good look
at yourself.

34:01.847 --> 34:05.016
A sweet little waif
holding a stick.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.117
That's all you are.

34:06.185 --> 34:08.453
Molly!
Nothing more.

34:09.455 --> 34:12.507
Aah!

34:17.763 --> 34:20.098
Hey. You ok?

34:20.165 --> 34:21.831
Uhh!

35:07.654 --> 35:08.839
Ok, thanks, Garcia.

35:08.839 --> 35:10.623
So Dr. Weingold
opened Jane's files.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.410
She can't release details,
but she said there honestly aren't many.

35:13.477 --> 35:14.978
Jane never admitted
to being a cutter,

35:15.046 --> 35:16.463
let alone what triggered it.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.466
She started acting out
after she lost her grandparents.

35:19.550 --> 35:20.984
Arrested for vandalism,

35:21.052 --> 35:23.787
removed from 2 foster homes
for destruction of property.

35:23.854 --> 35:25.388
Desperate attempts
to get attention.

35:25.456 --> 35:26.656
Is that why she
started cutting,

35:26.724 --> 35:27.807
another cry for help?

35:27.892 --> 35:29.659
Cutting is about control,

35:29.727 --> 35:32.328
similar to anorexia.
It's common in teenage girls

35:32.396 --> 35:34.464
who feel like they have
no control over their lives.

35:34.532 --> 35:37.067
Her grandparents' deaths
were probably the trigger.

35:37.134 --> 35:38.535
The loss of parental figures
at such a young age

35:38.602 --> 35:40.286
turns your world upside down.

35:40.371 --> 35:43.540
There's a lot of pain,
but no outlet.

35:43.607 --> 35:44.874
No one's in charge.

35:44.942 --> 35:47.010
Both Molly and Gail
can relate to that.

35:47.078 --> 35:49.162
Jane used them to convince
herself she's important.

35:49.246 --> 35:51.498
More than that, she thinks
she's a selfless savior.

35:51.582 --> 35:54.451
Instead of an orphan
that no one claimed.

36:06.564 --> 36:08.297
Stop!

36:08.349 --> 36:09.649
Stop...

36:09.734 --> 36:12.185
Help. Please, please.

36:12.269 --> 36:13.770
Stop--

36:52.176 --> 36:54.510
Man down.

36:55.512 --> 36:56.946
It's clear here.

36:57.948 --> 36:59.883
Clear.

37:09.026 --> 37:11.411
Well, he's not cold yet,
so we may have just missed her.

37:11.495 --> 37:13.630
After a confrontation like that,
she'll want to go someplace familiar,

37:13.697 --> 37:15.465
someplace she feels
in control.

37:15.532 --> 37:17.934
I'll let Hotch know
we're headed to the lake.

37:18.002 --> 37:19.969
There'll be no more pain.

37:20.037 --> 37:22.572
No more self-loathing.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.809
You'll go into the lake
and you'll feel loved.

37:25.876 --> 37:29.712
And I'll go on to help
others who are lost.

37:37.605 --> 37:39.956
How far is Onondaga Lake
from Jane's house?

37:40.024 --> 37:41.407
We're 2 minutes away.

37:41.492 --> 37:43.359
Send the nearest patrol car.

37:47.198 --> 37:48.898
Jane Gould!

37:51.035 --> 37:53.236
FBI! Let her go!

38:01.378 --> 38:04.597
Move away from the girl

38:04.682 --> 38:06.249
and get your hands
above your head.

38:06.300 --> 38:09.152
She'll drown if I let go!

38:09.220 --> 38:10.520
No, she won't.

38:10.587 --> 38:12.772
Move away now!

38:12.857 --> 38:15.325
Jane! Put it down!

38:17.895 --> 38:20.063
Help me! Help me!

38:21.431 --> 38:24.817
Please help me!
Please...

38:28.605 --> 38:30.073
Ohh! Stop!

38:31.158 --> 38:32.942
Help...Me.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.477
Molly!

38:37.281 --> 38:38.781
Help...

38:48.976 --> 38:51.261
She's in bad shape,
but she's stable.

38:51.328 --> 38:52.262
Molly. Molly!

38:52.313 --> 38:53.646
Dad...

38:53.731 --> 38:55.765
Oh, baby.

38:55.816 --> 38:58.101
There's so many things
I want to tell you,

38:58.168 --> 39:01.604
so many things
I want you to know.

39:01.672 --> 39:04.007
I love you so much.

39:04.074 --> 39:06.776
You have to understand!

39:06.844 --> 39:09.412
All I wanted to do
was help her.

39:16.086 --> 39:17.287
I love you, too.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.658
Oh, baby.

39:39.510 --> 39:43.246
"There is no chance,
no destiny, no fate

39:43.314 --> 39:46.316
that can hinder the firm resolve
of a determined soul."

39:46.367 --> 39:47.867
