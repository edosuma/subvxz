'In the criminal justice system,

00:02.977 --> 00:06.333
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.377 --> 00:10.609
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.657 --> 00:14.013
'are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

'These are their stories.'

00:17.657 --> 00:21.855
The victim's name is Ryan Davies.
Reported missing Friday, 6:00.

00:21.897 --> 00:25.094
- Positive ID?
- Pending notification of the family.

00:25.137 --> 00:27.526
- Who found the body?
- They did.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.647
What happened here, fellas?

00:31.697 --> 00:34.450
- We were playing touch.
- He sent me long.

00:34.497 --> 00:38.490
The ball rolled into the bushes.
I thought it was a pile of leaves.

00:39.897 --> 00:43.685
OK. Let's go through it again, real slow.

00:44.297 --> 00:46.253
What've we got?

00:46.297 --> 00:50.085
Kid was assaulted, strangled,
left in a shallow grave.

00:53.457 --> 00:55.448
- How old?
- Around eight.

00:55.497 --> 00:57.453

01:10.937 --> 01:12.655
Mrs Davies?

01:15.377 --> 01:20.132
- We're sorry to tell you this.
- Terry? Terry!

02:18.417 --> 02:22.330
- What have we learned?
- No one can handle child crimes.

02:22.377 --> 02:25.210
And lesson two, get out after two years.

02:25.257 --> 02:27.452
No one can handle the children.

02:28.297 --> 02:30.253
Specifically. Here.

02:30.297 --> 02:34.848
Ryan Davies, eight. Couple of kids
found his body by a playing field.

02:34.897 --> 02:38.253
Naked from waist down.
Signs of sexual assault.

02:38.297 --> 02:42.529
- Ligature neck marks, bruises.
- No signs of a struggle,

02:42.577 --> 02:45.296
no weapon, no evidence at the scene.

02:45.337 --> 02:48.249
- A shallow grave?
- There are marshes nearby.

02:48.297 --> 02:52.370
- The crime probably happened there.
- We'll look there for evidence.

02:52.417 --> 02:55.375
Reported missing
40 hours before being found.

02:55.417 --> 02:59.729
- Time of death, Friday, 5:00pm.
- Any idea what caused the bruises?

02:59.777 --> 03:04.646
A hand. The marks were round and
varied from 0.5 to 3 inches diameter.

03:04.697 --> 03:06.335
Parents have a history of abuse?

03:06.377 --> 03:08.686
- Baby-sitter? Uncle?
- Teachers? Coaches?

03:08.737 --> 03:12.696
I'll check those adults and search
for any registered sex offenders.

03:12.737 --> 03:16.366
- Any recent abductions nearby?
- Not that we know of.

03:16.417 --> 03:19.853
Body was transported from A to B,
left in a shallow grave.

03:19.897 --> 03:23.492
Transporting it, leaving it exposed...
Hallmarks of a stranger.

03:23.537 --> 03:28.327
Parents saw him last after school.
He went to a comic bookshop.

03:28.377 --> 03:32.052
- He never made it.
- Who lets an eight-year-old out alone?

03:32.097 --> 03:34.895
Watch kids all day,
you wind up with safe neurotics.

03:34.937 --> 03:38.452
Let's canvas the neighbourhood. All right?

03:47.697 --> 03:51.690
- You ever think about having kids?
- Why? I have you.

03:51.737 --> 03:53.728
I think about it. All the time.

03:53.777 --> 03:55.768
- Cookies for sale.
- Hi.

03:55.817 --> 03:59.492
- Who are you?
- Detectives Munch and Cassidy.

03:59.537 --> 04:02.370
- Hear about Ryan?
- What do you know about it?

04:02.417 --> 04:05.329
I know I won't let her out of my sight.

04:05.377 --> 04:07.015
- How much?
- Five bucks.

04:07.057 --> 04:09.810
Five bucks? All right.

04:09.857 --> 04:12.655
Give me four.

04:13.857 --> 04:15.848
- You go to school here?
- Yeah.

04:15.897 --> 04:17.728
Yeah?

04:17.777 --> 04:19.608
Did you know Ryan?

04:19.656 --> 04:22.490
- I ate at his house once.
- You did?

04:22.537 --> 04:28.453
Did you know someone hurt him?
We're looking for the person who did that.

04:28.497 --> 04:33.412
Can you remember if anyone's talked
about what might have happened?

04:36.457 --> 04:38.652
Boys. Older boys.

04:38.697 --> 04:40.892
Boys. Older boys? Who?

04:42.657 --> 04:45.615
- It's OK.
- Mike D and Jimmy G.

04:45.657 --> 04:48.615
Do you know where they hang out?

04:53.057 --> 04:57.255
- You Jimmy G?
- No, I'm Mike D. Who wants to know?

04:58.937 --> 05:01.690
Guess that's obvious, huh?

05:01.737 --> 05:03.693
What's up?

05:03.737 --> 05:06.695
You tell us. You know Ryan Davies?

05:06.737 --> 05:10.935
- I live two houses down from him.
- See anything Friday night?

05:10.977 --> 05:12.933
Saw a lot.

05:12.977 --> 05:18.210
When something happens,
look for what's strange before it happens.

05:18.257 --> 05:21.567
- Don't pate-ronise me.
- Actually, it's patt-ronise.

05:22.577 --> 05:24.886
- What was different?
- There's a weird guy.

05:24.937 --> 05:30.170
Old dude, riding his bike around school.
Same time every day.

05:30.217 --> 05:35.655
- Was he there Friday night?
- Weird guy. Skin on his head's thin.

05:35.697 --> 05:38.894
- Seen him before?
- No. He only started a month ago.

05:38.937 --> 05:41.770
- What do you know about him?
- Last name's Turbit.

05:41.817 --> 05:44.047
- Hides out in his apartment.
- His hole.

05:44.097 --> 05:46.657
- On Linwood.
- Cool. Thanks.

05:46.697 --> 05:49.495
You know, I thought Men In Black sucked.

05:49.537 --> 05:54.008
Better than appropriating
black culture for your own bad self.

05:54.057 --> 05:56.776
At least be original.

06:03.457 --> 06:05.254
You like the park?

06:05.297 --> 06:08.573
I like the trees and grass,
the granite outcroppings.

06:08.617 --> 06:11.575
Like a wilderness. I bike there.

06:11.617 --> 06:15.576
- It's a nice neighbourhood.
- That's why I moved.

06:15.617 --> 06:19.166
- Why the playing field?
- I don't understand.

06:19.217 --> 06:23.176
Why do you ride your bike
by the playing field?

06:23.217 --> 06:26.653
Aside from the fact that it's beautiful?

06:26.697 --> 06:29.131
OK.

06:29.177 --> 06:32.886
I love city parks. You get a sense of history.

06:32.937 --> 06:37.647
Central Park was a sheep meadow
before it was transformed into...

06:37.697 --> 06:41.007
Usually only kids hang out by the field.

06:42.137 --> 06:44.093
I see.

06:44.137 --> 06:48.369
It's unusual for a grown man
to hang out where kids play.

06:49.657 --> 06:51.852
Some may say inappropriate.

06:52.657 --> 06:57.173
It's a public space. I ride through
the fields on my way home from work.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.970
Helps me clear my mind.

07:00.017 --> 07:03.976
- What do you do?
- I work at the recycling centre.

07:04.017 --> 07:08.613
I sort out plastic bottles,
the clear from the coloured.

07:08.657 --> 07:12.206
- The green, the red...
- You bike to work?

07:12.257 --> 07:15.647
Absolutely, it's better for the environment.

07:15.697 --> 07:20.566
Imagine the air in this city
if people rode their bikes everywhere.

07:20.617 --> 07:26.613
I've got a great old bike, classic cruiser,
out back. Someone's jealous.

07:26.657 --> 07:30.616
It's been moved, the chain stolen,
you name it.

07:30.657 --> 07:33.012
- Tough city.
- It is.

07:33.057 --> 07:36.333
We're investigating
the murder of a young boy.

07:36.377 --> 07:39.210
His body was found at the playing field.

07:43.457 --> 07:45.413
Oh, no.

07:45.457 --> 07:48.529
- Did you see anyone when going home?
- No.

07:48.577 --> 07:54.129
- Friday night, you go straight home?
- Friday? No. I went to the Tavern.

07:54.177 --> 07:57.169
- Had a few drinks.
- You like to drink?

07:57.217 --> 07:59.173
No! No.

07:59.217 --> 08:02.289
It's my stamp collection.

08:05.377 --> 08:09.370
- My old man used to collect stamps.
- I never saw the appeal.

08:09.417 --> 08:12.966
- American history. Planes, trains...
- Elvis.

08:13.017 --> 08:15.690
Tangible proof of people communicating.

08:15.737 --> 08:20.094
Sold the set when Maureen was born.
Bought a bassinet, helped with rent.

08:20.137 --> 08:21.729
Look.

08:25.457 --> 08:29.928
I wonder if this dirt matches
the field where we found Ryan.

08:31.857 --> 08:34.006
Let's find out.

08:35.017 --> 08:37.975
My parents told me never eat sweets.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.293
- So now you're overcompensating?
- Yeah.

08:41.337 --> 08:44.295
I'm guessing they also said
you should never get married.

08:44.337 --> 08:47.295
- Hey!
- Forensics is working on that dirt.

08:47.337 --> 08:50.613
Jeffries is working on Turbit's background.

08:50.657 --> 08:53.649
- Definitely strange.
- I almost touched his box

08:53.697 --> 08:56.928
where he keeps his stamp collection,
the guy freaks out.

08:56.977 --> 09:00.253
The kids put him at the field at five.

09:00.297 --> 09:04.256
- Turbit says he was drinking.
- We need to search his apartment.

09:04.297 --> 09:09.246
We'll need an ID. Get that,
we get the warrant. Sort out the line-up.

09:09.297 --> 09:12.448
- Get Turbit and our eyewitnesses.
- You got it.

09:18.657 --> 09:20.329
Recognise anyone?

09:21.657 --> 09:23.136
Number three.

09:23.177 --> 09:25.247
Number three.

09:25.297 --> 09:29.256
He was by the school
the day Ryan Davies disappeared.

09:29.297 --> 09:31.253
Are you sure?

09:31.297 --> 09:34.175
That's all for now.

09:36.417 --> 09:40.251
- Friday night, I was at the Tavern.
- So you said.

09:40.297 --> 09:43.653
- Anyone see you?
- I would guess so.

09:43.697 --> 09:45.813
What were you doing there?

09:48.057 --> 09:52.733
I had just acquired the Inverted Jenny,
number C3A.

09:52.777 --> 09:55.610
The airplane, upside down?

09:55.657 --> 10:02.927
24 cents. It was in poor condition but it was
a remarkable deal. I wanted to celebrate.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.253
- You know Ryan Davies?
- Who?

10:06.297 --> 10:10.688
- What did you drink at the Tavern?
- Er, a black and tan.

10:10.737 --> 10:15.367
- Who'd you talk to?
- Erm, some guys. I play cards.

10:15.417 --> 10:18.375
- What kind?
- Er, penny ante.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.373
With whom?

10:20.417 --> 10:23.932
Erm, I don't know their names.

10:23.977 --> 10:26.969
I usually keep to myself.

10:28.857 --> 10:31.052
I need to talk to you.

10:33.537 --> 10:37.246
In his precinct
there are nine registered sex offenders.

10:37.297 --> 10:42.417
- Only one MO matches this case.
- Turbit was convicted 11 years ago.

10:42.457 --> 10:46.132
Did his time, paroled.
Filled out his paperwork

10:46.177 --> 10:51.968
with the sex-offender monitoring unit
as required. Been out a year.

10:52.017 --> 10:56.807
- What was he convicted of?
- He re-registers every 90 days.

10:56.857 --> 11:01.533
- What was he convicted of?
- Child molestation.

11:01.577 --> 11:06.048
A boy. A boy
two months older than Ryan Davies.

11:12.897 --> 11:14.569
Move back there!

11:14.617 --> 11:18.371
- Maybe we can do the search later.
- They look harmless.

11:18.417 --> 11:23.571
- Why weren't we informed about this?
- You let a child molester live here?

11:23.617 --> 11:26.893
I will not argue because I agree with you.

11:26.937 --> 11:29.770
But I am not the parole board.

11:29.817 --> 11:35.255
- I let my son be alone with him.
- He lured my child with his stamps!

11:35.297 --> 11:38.573
Are you listening now?

11:38.617 --> 11:40.573
I'm sorry.

11:43.857 --> 11:46.007
Not all sex offenders re-offend.

11:46.057 --> 11:49.413
A first-timer's just one
that hasn't been caught before.

11:49.457 --> 11:53.416
I met with Mr Turbit.
In my opinion he wasn't a threat.

11:53.457 --> 11:58.975
- Is that why neighbours weren't notified?
- You saw what happened.

11:59.017 --> 12:02.976
Neighbourhood finds out,
the sex offender becomes a target.

12:03.017 --> 12:08.091
- Community rights versus individual?
- Anyone with an internet connection

12:08.137 --> 12:13.131
can go to a sex-offenders website
and find out all about Turbit.

12:13.177 --> 12:15.691
He is a simple, religious man.

12:15.737 --> 12:19.366
His therapy went well. He had,
in my opinion, a genuine turnaround.

12:19.417 --> 12:24.013
One year out, he molests another kid,
only this one dies. A turnaround?

12:24.057 --> 12:26.207
Doesn't sound like the Turbit I knew.

12:26.257 --> 12:32.173
- Excuse me. You knew him in prison.
- When you're out, you act different.

12:32.217 --> 12:35.493
He showed genuine remorse for his crime.
He couldn't sleep...

12:35.537 --> 12:40.486
His victim couldn't walk for a month.
He was in hospital for four weeks.

12:40.537 --> 12:42.767
The night it happened Bill was high.

12:42.817 --> 12:47.686
No, overloaded on a psychedelic
STP cocktail. He was psychotic.

12:47.737 --> 12:52.686
The last thing he remembers
is a boy at his door selling candy.

12:52.737 --> 12:58.016
- The neighbours heard screams...
- Police found the boy unconscious.

12:58.057 --> 13:02.096
They found Bill balled up in terror.
He thought the boy was after him.

13:02.137 --> 13:05.652
He believed the boy had died
and his corpse was attacking him.

13:05.697 --> 13:09.451
It wasn't the boy's screams
the neighbours heard, it was Turbit's.

13:14.457 --> 13:17.893
- This blood test is unnecessary.
- We got a court order.

13:17.937 --> 13:21.407
- What will you match it against?
- DNA under the boy's fingernails.

13:21.457 --> 13:25.894
These new laws favour the public
against individual's rights.

13:25.937 --> 13:30.647
- Your fight, not mine.
- My client had more freedom inside.

13:30.697 --> 13:34.406
- Please don't. Please don't.
- Mr Turbit? Mr Turbit.

13:34.457 --> 13:37.733
We've a court order
to obtain a blood sample.

13:37.777 --> 13:40.735
We can do it one of two ways.
My way or your way.

13:40.777 --> 13:44.770
- I don't like needles.
- Sir, please cooperate.

13:44.817 --> 13:47.775
No, no. No!

13:47.817 --> 13:50.206
No! No! No!

13:52.817 --> 13:56.446
No! No! No!

13:58.177 --> 14:00.975
Thank you for stopping by.

14:01.977 --> 14:05.936
My son wore glasses.
Have you seen them?

14:05.977 --> 14:10.255
I'm sorry. We haven't.
We do have officers searching the area.

14:10.297 --> 14:12.936
He can't see without them.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.411
We'll do our best to find them.

14:15.457 --> 14:18.767
Please keep in touch.
Let us know how things are going.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.808
Promise.

14:24.017 --> 14:25.496
Daddy, over here!

14:25.537 --> 14:27.607
- Over where?
- Here.

14:27.657 --> 14:31.616
- We waited as long as we could.
- Yeah, I was...

14:31.657 --> 14:33.613
Where's Dickie?

14:33.657 --> 14:35.648
I'm sure he's playing ball.

14:46.217 --> 14:49.493
What's the matter, Daddy?
You mad at me?

14:49.537 --> 14:51.528
No. No.

14:58.137 --> 15:00.014
Turbit's a pay-cheque drinker.

15:00.057 --> 15:04.653
- Comes in every other week?
- Yeah. Drinks about half his pay.

15:04.697 --> 15:08.133
- He get paid last week?
- He was here.

15:08.177 --> 15:10.133
What night?

15:10.177 --> 15:13.886
- Friday.
- You see him playing cards?

15:15.657 --> 15:18.410
I gotta tell you something.

15:18.457 --> 15:23.406
I have a girl a year older than that
Davies kid. She lives with her mom.

15:23.457 --> 15:26.574
- I thought about her all last night.
- I know.

15:26.617 --> 15:31.896
Believe me, I know. But did Turbit
play cards with anyone that night?

15:32.977 --> 15:37.448
Not that I saw.
And I know everyone in here.

15:37.497 --> 15:39.089
What time did he leave?

15:41.377 --> 15:44.847
You know, he left for a few hours
and then he came back.

15:44.897 --> 15:47.252
Seemed real upset about something.

15:53.617 --> 15:56.848
What d'you think about
when you think about having kids?

15:56.897 --> 15:58.933
- Selfish stuff, mostly.
- Like?

15:58.977 --> 16:01.127
How I'd feel, hopeful and stuff.

16:01.177 --> 16:04.852
I think of all the trouble
they're gonna get in.

16:04.897 --> 16:08.572
You hope they're not gonna make
the same mistakes you made,

16:08.617 --> 16:11.973
have a better school,
a better right hook. That they'll...

16:12.017 --> 16:14.008
- Just say no?
- Just say yes.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.854
Then we get this case.

16:15.897 --> 16:18.889
- All the possibilities disappear.
- Yeah.

16:21.897 --> 16:25.856
Thanks. And you?
Never wanted the responsibility?

16:25.897 --> 16:29.253
I wouldn't want to give a kid
the responsibility of me.

16:29.897 --> 16:34.334
The soil from the bike matches soil
from where the body was found.

16:34.377 --> 16:37.335
- But?
- The soil is indigenous to the area.

16:37.377 --> 16:41.336
- It doesn't put him at the scene.
- Just in the neighbourhood.

16:41.377 --> 16:44.767
Circumstantial.
Ryan's glasses ever show up?

16:44.817 --> 16:47.650
I don't think so,
but I just started on the case.

16:47.697 --> 16:49.688
I wanted to show you something.

16:49.737 --> 16:53.650
Ligature marks around the neck
have an unusual pattern,

16:53.697 --> 16:55.767
indentations about an inch apart.

16:55.817 --> 16:58.456
- What scale are these photos?
- Life-size.

16:58.497 --> 17:00.727
Chain?

17:08.936 --> 17:10.893
Perfect.

17:10.936 --> 17:13.690
We're still waiting for the DNA
on the bike chain?

17:13.737 --> 17:16.934
Yes, but the chain fits the marks
on Ryan's neck.

17:16.977 --> 17:20.446
We have two witnesses
who put him at the field.

17:20.497 --> 17:24.251
And a bartender who can blow a hole
through two hours of Turbit's alibi.

17:24.297 --> 17:27.653
Plus one precedent-setting night
12 years ago.

17:27.696 --> 17:32.452
- That's not enough?
- It is. Who was his first victim?

17:32.497 --> 17:35.250
Christopher James.
Almost 21, still lives with Mom.

17:35.297 --> 17:37.094
Father left. Couldn't deal.

17:37.137 --> 17:42.450
Talk to him. Compare MOs. Come up
with the same MO, we put him away.

17:46.457 --> 17:48.413
Christopher?

17:49.457 --> 17:53.052
Hey. I'm Detective Benson.
My partner, Detective Stabler.

17:53.097 --> 17:55.088
Christopher.

17:59.577 --> 18:01.693
Christopher?

18:01.737 --> 18:05.366
What Bill Turbit did to you
he did to someone else.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.806
- What was his name?
- Ryan.

18:07.857 --> 18:09.848
Ryan Davies.

18:09.897 --> 18:12.286
Ryan...

18:12.337 --> 18:16.250
I know you've told your story before,
but I need to record it.

18:20.617 --> 18:23.893
Tell me what Bill Turbit did to you.

18:25.697 --> 18:31.135
My mother didn't want me to go out alone.
I insisted, I was a big boy.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.372
I knocked on his door.

18:33.417 --> 18:36.409
I had four chocolate bars left.

18:37.937 --> 18:42.169
He invited me in.
I needed to use the rest room.

18:43.857 --> 18:46.815
When I came out, he wanted to play.

18:46.857 --> 18:52.215
He wanted me to ride on his back,
like he was a donkey.

18:52.257 --> 18:55.010
And he took off his belt

18:55.057 --> 18:59.767
and he pretended it was his harness
and he got down on all fours.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.446
I did not want to.

19:10.857 --> 19:13.325
And when I refused, he took the belt

19:14.697 --> 19:17.655
and he wrapped it around my neck

19:17.697 --> 19:20.689
and forced me down on all fours.

19:22.697 --> 19:26.167
And he pulled the belt tight around my neck.

19:27.217 --> 19:29.447
And then he began

19:30.617 --> 19:32.653
to hurt me.

19:36.017 --> 19:39.487
And he pulled the belt tighter and tighter.

19:41.017 --> 19:44.009
And the darkness came over my head.

19:49.657 --> 19:51.056
Thank you.

19:53.057 --> 19:55.571
You never told me your first name.

19:56.617 --> 19:58.175
Olivia.

19:58.217 --> 20:01.527
Olivia? Origin of the name, Greek.

20:01.577 --> 20:03.533
Four syllables.

20:03.577 --> 20:06.375
Means olive tree.

20:16.697 --> 20:20.610
Keep your head down, your mouth shut.
You'll be all right.

20:20.657 --> 20:23.535
Give me some space here, people.
Thank you. Let's go.

20:30.097 --> 20:32.975
- What happens to him now?
- Sir, stand back.

20:33.017 --> 20:35.133
- Detective Stabler?
- What?

20:35.177 --> 20:39.250
- I wasn't straight with you.
- What is it?

20:39.297 --> 20:41.857
She's my partner. Go ahead.

20:41.897 --> 20:44.934
The night Ryan vanished,
Turbit was in my bar.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.854
The whole night?

20:48.017 --> 20:51.373
Yes. He was babbling about postage
or something.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.931
He didn't leave, not even for an hour?

20:53.977 --> 20:56.889
He was in the Tavern all night.
He was playing cards.

21:03.937 --> 21:07.930
If he didn't do the Davies kid,
he'll do some other. You know it.

21:12.057 --> 21:14.446
- We can't hold him any more.
- Bail was denied.

21:14.497 --> 21:17.933
Only because I spoke to you
after the judge had ruled.

21:17.977 --> 21:22.175
If Turbit can be placed at this bar
his attorney will have him out.

21:22.217 --> 21:24.208
What's this bartender's agenda?

21:24.257 --> 21:27.055
Guilty conscience. He's a retired transit cop.

21:27.097 --> 21:30.294
He couldn't live with himself
making a false statement.

21:30.337 --> 21:33.568
Let's double-check Turbit's alibi anyway.

21:35.537 --> 21:37.016
What?

21:37.057 --> 21:38.456
Er, no.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.248
We still have two eyewitnesses

21:41.297 --> 21:44.494
that place Turbit at the field
at Ryan's time of death.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.528
Two teenagers versus a retired cop?

21:46.577 --> 21:48.568
We're gonna release him.

21:48.617 --> 21:52.690
The chain we found at Turbit's match
the ligature marks on Ryan's neck.

21:52.737 --> 21:55.251
Which means very little
without DNA results.

21:55.297 --> 21:57.731
Sex offenders have an 88% recidivism rate.

21:57.777 --> 21:59.768
I'm obliged to inform his counsel.

21:59.817 --> 22:01.455
Yeah. You do.

22:01.497 --> 22:04.534
But you don't have a time constraint on that.

22:04.577 --> 22:07.569
That was your boss.
DA wants me down there now.

22:07.617 --> 22:09.608
So don't do anything yet, huh?

22:13.657 --> 22:17.206
Thanks for coming down, Don.
Do you want coffee?

22:17.257 --> 22:21.250
No, I'm good.
A little confused but other than that...

22:21.297 --> 22:24.095
Used to be,
'You catch'em, we cook 'em!'

22:24.137 --> 22:26.128
Now the laws change with the seasons

22:26.177 --> 22:29.647
and we're not just prosecutors,
we're politicians too.

22:33.697 --> 22:36.416
Schiff asked me to talk to you.

22:37.417 --> 22:40.614
We need you to hold the child molester.
Turbit.

22:42.257 --> 22:45.454
If your people have new evidence,
I'd be glad to.

22:46.977 --> 22:49.047
'The monster awakes.'

22:49.097 --> 22:53.887
It's not enough the neighbours
weren't informed, now we let him go.

22:53.937 --> 22:58.169
Well, I share their pain, Morris,
but Mr Turbit's alibi checked out.

22:58.217 --> 23:01.414
I believe that means
that legally he's a free man.

23:02.897 --> 23:06.492
He's a poster boy for
the lock-up-the-perverts movement.

23:06.537 --> 23:11.088
People don't care for civil liberties
when their kids are at risk.

23:11.137 --> 23:14.925
Personally, I don't disagree.
But how is this my problem?

23:14.977 --> 23:17.093
It's not. It's mine.

23:19.057 --> 23:22.732
Right now there's a rider
to a mental health bill in Albany

23:22.777 --> 23:27.726
that'd give the state wide latitude
to keep sex offenders off the street.

23:27.777 --> 23:30.371
By holding them indefinitely?

23:30.417 --> 23:34.376
Upon release, you get a psychiatrist
to convince the parole board

23:34.417 --> 23:38.535
the offender can't control his impulses,
he's likely to rape again.

23:38.577 --> 23:41.375
He gets sent away to Creedmore
for the rest of his life.

23:41.417 --> 23:45.695
How can a man be found sane enough
to stand trial, be convicted,

23:45.737 --> 23:48.934
and then upon release
be found insane and locked up again?

23:48.977 --> 23:51.127
It's called civil commitment.

23:52.257 --> 23:54.248
And they need a test case.

23:55.577 --> 24:00.014
Well, like you said, Counsellor,
I only catch 'em,

24:00.057 --> 24:02.173
but last I heard, the rule of law was

24:02.217 --> 24:05.732
you do the crime, you do the time.
Mr Turbit did his.

24:05.777 --> 24:08.530
Why not just release him
with a giant M on his back?

24:08.577 --> 24:10.568
We'll work as fast as we can.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.415
I've already contacted our psychologist.

24:13.457 --> 24:16.767
As a mitzvah, can you buy me some time?

24:17.777 --> 24:20.416
This goes against everything I believe.

24:20.457 --> 24:22.015
I know.

24:22.057 --> 24:24.048
Please.

24:25.657 --> 24:28.012
You got 24 hours. Not a minute more.

24:28.817 --> 24:30.216
Hup!

24:31.217 --> 24:34.209
- When will you talk to my class?
- I don't know.

24:35.217 --> 24:37.811
Loop it around. Oh!

24:37.857 --> 24:40.246
I could take your badge in
for show and tell.

24:40.297 --> 24:42.094
Yeah, I'll talk.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.325
Looking for paedophiles, Dad?

24:47.057 --> 24:49.332
- Where did you get that from?
- Danny Baker.

24:49.377 --> 24:52.175
He says you spend your time
hunting paedophiles.

24:52.217 --> 24:55.334
- What'd you tell Danny Baker?
- I told him you were a cop.

24:55.377 --> 24:57.652
You can tell him
when you come to my class.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.688
- Deal. Wanna fly?
- Yeah.

24:59.737 --> 25:01.728
Ready? Hup!

25:01.777 --> 25:03.768
Up!

25:03.817 --> 25:05.887
Go. Go. Go.

25:05.937 --> 25:09.930
This Dr Greenblatt is different
from Turbit's prison psychologist.

25:09.977 --> 25:12.332
She was hand-picked by the DA's office.

25:12.377 --> 25:15.210
Ask enough doctors,
you'll get the opinion you want.

25:17.217 --> 25:20.732
You're not comfortable
with a psychiatric review, are you?

25:20.777 --> 25:23.575
I'm not comfortable with situational ethics.

25:26.137 --> 25:29.174
'Bill, you can explain that question

25:29.217 --> 25:31.287
instead of writing it out.'

25:33.457 --> 25:35.573
OK.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.209
Erm...

25:38.737 --> 25:42.252
When I saw the photos
from the crime scene,

25:43.497 --> 25:45.692
the crime scene was my apartment.

25:47.057 --> 25:51.847
I couldn't believe when they told me
it was me... who had done that.

25:53.817 --> 25:55.296
Me.

25:55.337 --> 25:57.487
Erm...

25:57.537 --> 26:01.735
The scratches on the wall,
carpet that squished with blood...

26:03.737 --> 26:06.205
It looked like an animal
had been in my place.

26:06.257 --> 26:08.976
Did you fantasise
about what you'd done?

26:09.017 --> 26:11.372
It was the drugs.

26:11.417 --> 26:15.933
My biggest fantasy before that
was maybe sitting by the window

26:15.977 --> 26:19.890
and waiting for the lady across
the air shaft

26:19.937 --> 26:21.928
to take off her blouse.

26:22.937 --> 26:25.929
Do you feel remorse
for what you did to Christopher?

26:31.657 --> 26:34.251
Not a day's gone by

26:34.297 --> 26:37.653
where the thought of that boy
doesn't go through my head.

26:39.537 --> 26:42.529
But I don't remember
a single minute of it.

26:43.537 --> 26:46.370
It's, it's like watching a home movie.

26:47.857 --> 26:50.451
You don't remember the birthday itself,

26:50.497 --> 26:53.455
but see the movie often enough,
it becomes the memory.

26:53.497 --> 26:55.488
You know what I mean?

26:55.537 --> 26:58.609
There are two Billys involved in this.

26:59.457 --> 27:01.448
I don't know what scared me more.

27:04.257 --> 27:06.248
What had been done to the boy,

27:08.457 --> 27:10.652
or that the person who had done it

27:13.257 --> 27:15.248
was me.

27:19.457 --> 27:23.848
I just had... no idea
I was capable of doing that.

27:27.377 --> 27:29.572
But you never know, do you?

27:32.457 --> 27:35.494
I'd like to see these DNA results
as soon as possible.

27:36.497 --> 27:38.772
I told them to rush those results.

27:38.817 --> 27:42.605
Said they'd have them by this afternoon.
That was four hours ago.

27:43.617 --> 27:46.415
Someday, DNA testing will take 10 seconds.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.448
God help us all.

27:48.497 --> 27:51.807
This is Captain Donald Cragen
of the sex crimes unit.

27:51.857 --> 27:58.490
We're still waiting for results on sample
number Oscar Charlie 7729 Apple. Yeah.

28:00.657 --> 28:02.932
You did?

28:02.977 --> 28:05.013
Well, thanks for telling us.

28:05.057 --> 28:06.729
What have we got?

28:08.977 --> 28:12.572
Turbit's DNA did not match
the DNA we found on Ryan.

28:16.097 --> 28:18.975
Mr Turbit, you're free to go.

28:21.777 --> 28:24.974
- Let's go.
- Just like that, huh?

28:25.017 --> 28:28.054
I'll have some uniforms
put outside his apartment,

28:28.097 --> 28:30.452
but yeah, yeah, just like that.

28:31.457 --> 28:33.846
Erm, do I get my bike now?

28:33.897 --> 28:35.615
Yeah.

28:42.057 --> 28:46.096
So, can I count on your detectives
at the hearing tomorrow?

28:46.137 --> 28:49.766
- For how long?
- An hour, hour and a half.

28:49.817 --> 28:54.208
They'll testify as to Mr Turbit's
behaviour when first interviewed.

28:54.257 --> 28:56.566
Was he co-operative, lucid? Basic stuff.

28:56.617 --> 29:00.166
There have to be other options.
Depo-Provera?

29:00.217 --> 29:03.687
You miss one shot
and the drug loses its effectiveness.

29:03.737 --> 29:06.968
And it only quietens impulses.
It doesn't erase them.

29:07.017 --> 29:08.928
Intensive therapy?

29:08.977 --> 29:12.890
We're not talking about issues of
low self-esteem or Oedipal rage.

29:12.937 --> 29:17.408
This is something I can't codify
into an exact number of sessions.

29:17.457 --> 29:22.326
The civil commitment hearing is
the best way to protect our community.

29:22.377 --> 29:25.528
You're gonna put him away
even though he didn't kill the boy?

29:25.577 --> 29:27.568
Consider it a pre-emptive strike.

29:27.617 --> 29:29.972
You really think he'll rape again?

29:30.817 --> 29:33.126
You can make book on it, Captain.

30:07.857 --> 30:09.927
Have you found Ryan's glasses?

30:09.977 --> 30:13.606
The case is not going very well.

30:13.657 --> 30:15.613
I knew it!

30:15.657 --> 30:18.171
We don't think we found the right person.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.208
- We're sorry.
- It's my fault.

30:22.857 --> 30:24.973
I should have never let Ryan...

30:25.017 --> 30:27.212
I shouldn't have let him go!

30:27.257 --> 30:30.408
There's a hearing this morning
to try to lock Turbit away.

30:30.457 --> 30:32.448
Who else could've done it?

30:32.497 --> 30:34.533
We have some solid leads.

30:41.457 --> 30:45.450
And when we say check their ID,
we mean read it.

30:45.497 --> 30:48.136
Don't be afraid.
Demand that they show it to you,

30:48.177 --> 30:50.168
not just flash it at you.

30:50.217 --> 30:53.687
That means you guys
have got to really look at it

30:53.737 --> 30:55.728
to make sure it looks like my badge,

30:55.777 --> 30:58.530
because the two things that the er...

30:59.977 --> 31:01.968
Child molesters.

31:02.017 --> 31:09.128
Child molesters count on is... play-acting,
which is, er... All that is is pretending.

31:09.177 --> 31:13.693
They might pretend
that they're a policeman or doctor.

31:13.737 --> 31:18.527
And the other thing is that they know
that kids want to please grown-ups.

31:18.577 --> 31:21.375
They might say, 'Hey, I've lost my kitten.

31:21.417 --> 31:23.408
'Can you help me find him?'

31:23.457 --> 31:28.485
So, if a stranger says,
'Come with me. Your mom's been hurt',

31:28.537 --> 31:30.528
what do you do?

31:30.577 --> 31:34.092
Again, you make sure
that you see their identification

31:34.137 --> 31:37.334
and you never get into a car
with someone you don't know.

31:37.377 --> 31:40.653
What if you know them
and they do something bad, anyway?

31:40.697 --> 31:42.813
Then, you talk to your teacher.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.291
What if there's nobody?

31:45.337 --> 31:48.090
Well, you know something,
then there's you.

31:48.137 --> 31:52.892
Each one of you has that little voice
inside of you. You must listen to it.

31:52.937 --> 31:57.010
It's the voice that makes the hairs
on the back of your neck stand up.

31:57.057 --> 31:59.048
What if they try to hurt you?

31:59.097 --> 32:01.895
Then, you say no!

32:01.937 --> 32:05.213
- Can we all say that really loudly?
- No!

32:05.257 --> 32:07.725
And then you run to your mom or dad.

32:07.777 --> 32:10.894
What if your dad's
the one that's hurting you?

32:16.257 --> 32:19.806
Then you tell Dickie, and he'll tell me.

32:19.857 --> 32:21.848
OK?

32:30.257 --> 32:32.646
You're the court-appointed psychiatrist

32:32.697 --> 32:35.689
who's done extensive work
at the Avenal Facility.

32:35.737 --> 32:37.534
- Correct?
- Yes.

32:37.577 --> 32:39.966
Could you describe Avenal for us, please?

32:40.017 --> 32:44.056
It's a maximum-security prison
for violent sex offenders.

32:44.097 --> 32:47.976
And during Mr Turbit's
12-year incarceration at Avenal,

32:48.017 --> 32:51.930
- did he attack an inmate sexually?
- Not to my knowledge.

32:51.977 --> 32:54.775
- A guard? A psychiatrist?
- No.

32:54.817 --> 32:59.766
So because of this one crime,
for which my client paid his debt to society...

32:59.817 --> 33:02.251
Which to an extreme degree of likelihood,

33:02.297 --> 33:04.572
- he will repeat.
- In your opinion!

33:04.617 --> 33:08.326
Isn't this whole legislation
nothing but a cheesy end-run

33:08.377 --> 33:11.449
around the cherished legal concept
of double jeopardy?

33:11.497 --> 33:15.012
- Not in my opinion.
- Come on, Dr Greenblatt.

33:15.057 --> 33:18.811
He was sane when convicted
and served his sentence.

33:18.857 --> 33:23.408
Isn't it convenient he be insane now
so you can put him away again?

33:23.457 --> 33:26.017
That's just plain unconstitutional.

33:26.057 --> 33:28.332
Ms Kreutzer, we take your point.

33:28.377 --> 33:29.935
Thank you, Judge.

33:29.977 --> 33:33.447
In fact, I need time
to review the proposed statute.

33:33.497 --> 33:35.488
We'll reconvene tomorrow.

33:36.497 --> 33:39.648
Until then, Mr Turbit, you're a free man.

33:40.657 --> 33:42.056
You did fine.

33:42.097 --> 33:44.088
Ryan's area alone had nine offenders.

33:44.137 --> 33:48.335
- Without kids, you don't understand.
- I understand double jeopardy.

33:48.377 --> 33:50.845
- Want guys like that around?
- So, lock 'em up?

33:50.897 --> 33:52.967
- Yeah.
- Where does it stop?

34:06.977 --> 34:08.774
Help!

34:10.657 --> 34:13.455
This eye-for-an-eye crap
doesn't work in practice.

34:13.496 --> 34:15.487
Especially when you get the wrong eye.

34:15.536 --> 34:18.927
- In Mr Davies' eyes, we failed.
- Doesn't justify his actions!

34:18.976 --> 34:21.445
I agree but I understand the impulse.

34:21.496 --> 34:25.695
A loved one gets hurt, a child,
a mother, we want to make it right.

34:25.737 --> 34:27.728
What happens to his stamp collection?

34:27.777 --> 34:30.574
Sell it. Give it to Crime Victims Board.

34:30.617 --> 34:33.609
- Where the hell are we with this?
- Back to square one.

34:35.456 --> 34:37.447
Two eyewitnesses.

34:39.857 --> 34:43.054
Hey, Jimmy G! What's up?

34:47.697 --> 34:49.688
Cola.

34:51.857 --> 34:55.406
You were so helpful before, man,
really helpful.

34:55.456 --> 34:59.166
We just want to talk to you again.
We'll ask you a few questions.

34:59.217 --> 35:01.651
Try this with me.
Breathe.

35:04.537 --> 35:06.892
It's good, right? Yeah.

35:06.937 --> 35:08.928
Weird being in here, isn't it?

35:08.977 --> 35:10.376
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:10.417 --> 35:13.966
- Whatever. It's cool.
- It's cool?

35:14.017 --> 35:16.372
So this is where Turbit was, huh?

35:16.417 --> 35:19.011
- Right here. Guy was a freak.
- Yeah!

35:19.057 --> 35:21.252
- Kinda creeped me out.
- Me too!

35:21.297 --> 35:23.288
Way he rode his bike around.

35:23.337 --> 35:25.328
- Always by the field.
- Yeah.

35:25.377 --> 35:28.494
- He'd stop and stare, watching us.
- Yeah.

35:28.537 --> 35:29.970
Which side?

35:31.177 --> 35:34.772
- Huh?
- Which side did he ride around?

35:34.817 --> 35:37.490
Er, you know, the north side.

35:37.537 --> 35:43.214
'North side? Boy Scouts kicked me out.
No sense of direction.'

35:43.257 --> 35:46.055
Is that the wood side or the river side?

35:46.097 --> 35:47.928
- Wood side.
- Wood side.

35:47.977 --> 35:49.968
By the field where they found Ryan.

35:50.777 --> 35:52.210
Right.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.408
- Ever talk to Turbit?
- No.

35:55.457 --> 35:57.846
Really? You never said anything to him?

35:57.897 --> 36:00.570
Not even,
'Go back to the planet you came from'?

36:00.617 --> 36:04.246
Maybe this world
is another planet's hell.

36:04.297 --> 36:07.573
Aldous Huxley also said,
'But I like the inconveniences.'

36:11.057 --> 36:13.651
When Turbit rode his bike,
where did he ride by?

36:13.697 --> 36:15.096
The sidewalk.

36:15.137 --> 36:17.367
By the woods or river?

36:17.417 --> 36:18.736
The river.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.086
Their stories don't match.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.128
Let's print them, take some blood.

36:23.177 --> 36:25.452
Let's search the area by the river.

36:28.457 --> 36:33.053
We're looking for a chain that'll match
the marks round Ryan's neck.

36:33.097 --> 36:36.487
Is it hard to see your kids
after working on this case?

36:38.537 --> 36:42.928
No harder than making love
after I hear of a rape victim's attack.

36:44.257 --> 36:46.646
- I've done this beat eight months.
- Right.

36:46.697 --> 36:50.770
At first, I was fine with it,
but sometimes, I just...

36:50.817 --> 36:54.366
I just... I can't...

36:54.417 --> 36:56.214
I know.

36:56.257 --> 36:59.215
Instead of seeing a woman
you see uterus, cervix.

36:59.257 --> 37:01.532
- Yeah.
- It's a clinical phase.

37:01.577 --> 37:04.216
It lasts a while.

37:05.217 --> 37:07.811
- What's the next phase?
- You don't wanna know.

37:11.057 --> 37:12.809
Hey.

37:12.857 --> 37:14.848
What have you got?

37:14.897 --> 37:17.206
It's just another quarter.

37:28.217 --> 37:30.208
Elliot!

37:40.657 --> 37:43.455
We're also looking for Ryan's glasses.

37:44.817 --> 37:47.456
Here's the partial print
from the boy's glasses.

37:47.497 --> 37:49.488
Jimmy G's print.

37:56.857 --> 37:58.848
It's a match.

38:04.017 --> 38:06.611
I think Mike's
the smarter of the two.

38:06.657 --> 38:08.056
Detectives?

38:08.097 --> 38:10.088
- Book smart.
- Found something.

38:10.137 --> 38:14.528
Mike's more than book smart.
He's the one with the conscience.

38:14.577 --> 38:17.045
- Are you sure?
- DNA doesn't lie.

38:17.097 --> 38:19.657
This is the chain used to kill Ryan.

38:19.697 --> 38:21.688
Turbit said his chain was stolen.

38:21.737 --> 38:24.934
- The tissue samples?
- The sample taken from Ryan's nails

38:24.977 --> 38:27.775
matched the sample
of one of your suspects.

38:27.817 --> 38:29.216
Which one?

38:29.257 --> 38:32.249
- You've known Mike D a long time.
- Since we were kids.

38:32.297 --> 38:34.492
He got a scholarship to a private school.

38:34.537 --> 38:37.654
He came back, though.
Didn't like all the Richie Riches.

38:37.697 --> 38:39.927
Just tell us what happened.

38:39.977 --> 38:41.968
I don't know.

38:42.017 --> 38:45.771
Well, if you don't tell us,
you know Mike will.

38:47.577 --> 38:53.607
And my mom, whenever I'd do something
bad she'd say, 'Boys will be boys.'

38:53.657 --> 38:58.526
Well, you know, right now,
it's every man for himself.

38:58.577 --> 39:00.568
We don't think you're a bad guy.

39:00.617 --> 39:04.371
We think you went along with Jimmy
and things got out of hand.

39:06.817 --> 39:09.809
But if you jerk us around, we'll bury you.

39:09.857 --> 39:13.486
Ryan did not deserve to die
the way that he did.

39:16.857 --> 39:18.768
You tell us what happened.

39:21.057 --> 39:23.048
I don't know where to start.

39:23.097 --> 39:25.372
Where d'you get the idea?

39:26.377 --> 39:28.527
Off the web.

39:28.577 --> 39:32.092
We were surfing and fell into
this sex offender website.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.128
That's where we found Mr Turbit.

39:35.297 --> 39:38.767
That's when we realised this freak
lived in the neighbourhood.

39:38.817 --> 39:41.809
The site was specific,

39:41.857 --> 39:45.247
very specific,
about what Mr Turbit had done.

39:45.297 --> 39:49.085
So specific it was like directions
that were easy to follow.

39:49.137 --> 39:52.891
We got the idea in our heads
and it was, like, too good to forget.

39:52.937 --> 39:54.928
It took over our minds.

39:54.977 --> 39:57.969
It was all Jimmy could talk about.

39:58.017 --> 40:00.611
At first, we just goofed around.

40:00.657 --> 40:03.854
Took Mr Turbit's bike, moved it.

40:03.897 --> 40:05.888
Took his bike chain.

40:07.017 --> 40:11.215
That chain. Jimmy always wondered
what Turbit might do with the chain.

40:11.257 --> 40:13.646
Turbit could do anything.

40:13.697 --> 40:17.087
Tell me about the Friday
when Ryan disappeared.

40:17.137 --> 40:19.810
We were in my garage, smoking.

40:19.857 --> 40:22.849
We see Ryan go by on his bike.
Back and forth.

40:22.897 --> 40:26.606
We started making fun of him.
'Who let the retard out alone?'

40:26.657 --> 40:30.855
'Whose bike was that? How many candy
bars did he sell to land that bike?'

40:30.937 --> 40:33.531
The bit about selling candy.
That's what it was.

40:33.577 --> 40:35.568
We just looked at each other.

40:36.377 --> 40:38.368
I grabbed Turbit's bike chain.

40:38.417 --> 40:42.205
We were just fooling
when we took him out by the marshes.

40:42.257 --> 40:44.646
And then his glasses fell off.

40:44.697 --> 40:47.257
That's when he really freaked out.

40:48.257 --> 40:50.248
I had to hold him down.

40:51.457 --> 40:53.573
- It was...
- What?

40:54.577 --> 40:56.056
It was what?

40:56.097 --> 40:58.133
I'm not gay or anything!

40:59.177 --> 41:01.168
It was awful.

41:01.217 --> 41:02.935
He started screaming.

41:02.977 --> 41:04.968
And he wouldn't shut up.

41:06.457 --> 41:11.133
We were worried someone would hear.
I asked him to be quiet, begged him.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.168
Then Jimmy took the bike chain.

41:13.217 --> 41:16.732
To shut the kid up!
I heard his neck snap.

41:17.737 --> 41:20.331
He just lay there.

41:22.257 --> 41:23.736
Still.

41:23.777 --> 41:25.972
Kid was a loser, anyway.
