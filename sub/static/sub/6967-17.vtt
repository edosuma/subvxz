01:30.757 --> 01:35.421
Southern Crescent to Red Crescent.
We got a downed plane at camp perimeter.

01:35.528 --> 01:38.520
We have nothing in the sky at this time.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.557
We got something down here.
We're gonna check it out.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.501
Medevac One, this is Red Crescent.

01:48.575 --> 01:52.978
Southern Crescent
reports a downed aircraft in their area.

02:53.806 --> 02:57.298
It's the Grand Ole Opry
on WSM Radio 650.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.901
Brought to you by
Goody's Headache Powder.

03:00.113 --> 03:04.379
When the night's been too long
and the party's been too hearty,

03:04.450 --> 03:10.389
Goody's Headache Powder straightens
you right out. You have my word on that.

03:18.898 --> 03:22.925
It was cigar-shaped,
red and green lights. Fast as hell!

03:23.036 --> 03:26.130
I seen three of 'em fly over Chester County.

03:26.239 --> 03:29.208
Six troopers were chasing 'em down 22.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.742
I see one now! It's over the water tower!

03:33.846 --> 03:35.905
I see it, too!

04:49.522 --> 04:54.357
From the trucker's description, the shape
he fired at could have been a mountain lion.

04:54.427 --> 04:55.553
Conceivably.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.722
The National Weather Service
last night reported

04:58.798 --> 05:01.995
atmospheric conditions in this area

05:02.101 --> 05:04.035
possibly conducive to lightning.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.161
Possibly.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.978
It is feasible
that the truck was struck by lightning,

05:15.048 --> 05:17.346
creating the electrical failure.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.510
It's feasible.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.412
And you know, there's a marsh over there.

05:23.456 --> 05:27.825
Those lights the driver saw
may have been swamp gas.

05:28.594 --> 05:31.563
- Swamp gas?
- It's a natural phenomenon.

05:31.631 --> 05:36.398
Phosphine and methane
rising from decaying organic matter ignite,

05:36.469 --> 05:38.767
creating globes of blue flame.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.636
Happens to me when I eat Dodger Dogs.

05:42.141 --> 05:46.168
How can a dozen witnesses,
including a squad of police vehicles,

05:46.245 --> 05:48.440
become hysterical over swamp gas?

05:48.548 --> 05:50.880
I've investigated multiple sightings.

05:50.983 --> 05:54.475
Chesapeake Bay, the Okobogee Lake,
Area 51 in Nevada.

05:54.587 --> 05:56.817
None had this much supporting evidence.

05:56.889 --> 06:01.656
Anecdotal data, exhaust residue,
radiation levels five times the norm.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.195
None of that evidence is conclusive.

06:04.263 --> 06:07.426
The question is,
why was the truck driver singled out?

06:07.500 --> 06:09.593
Isn't it more plausible

06:09.669 --> 06:15.699
that an exhausted driver got swept up in
the hysteria and fired upon hallucinations?

06:15.808 --> 06:18.470
After all, the road can play tricks on you.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.637
Yeah, it can play tricks on you.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.240
But not like this.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.487
I started these stopwatches at the same time.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.287
I don't know why they're holding me.

06:33.226 --> 06:37.720
This "firing a weapon on a county road"
charge is a lot o' horse manure.

06:38.664 --> 06:41.064
I'm a vet, and I know how to handle a gun.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.227
Mr Ranheim,

06:43.302 --> 06:47.830
can you elaborate on the report you filed
last night regarding your encounter?

06:47.907 --> 06:50.000
It was round.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.304
Like a saucer.

06:55.214 --> 06:57.273
And... green and orange lights.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.285
Last night you said it was
cigar-shaped and black.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.480
I didn't ask for this to happen.

07:07.260 --> 07:12.163
All I want is to deliver my shipment
of auto parts and forget...

07:19.238 --> 07:21.297
Pardon me for asking,

07:21.374 --> 07:23.899
but how long have you had that cough?

07:28.080 --> 07:29.172
Why?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.978
I'm just concerned.
You said you were a veteran.

07:32.985 --> 07:37.183
- What's that got to do with this?
- The cough, the fever, the rash.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.554
Those are symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome.

07:39.659 --> 07:45.393
- I was never in the Gulf War.
- So, how long have you not been yourself?

07:50.570 --> 07:52.663
Since the thing last night.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.707
Mr Ranheim? I'm Police Chief Rivers.

07:58.778 --> 08:03.545
Please, forgive the misunderstanding.
Your truck's been squared away. You may go.

08:03.616 --> 08:06.710
- I'd like to examine the truck.
- That won't be necessary.

08:06.786 --> 08:10.813
He had an alleged close encounter.
The truck will contain evidence.

08:10.923 --> 08:14.290
- If I may...
- You've gotten all you're gonna get.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.887
- We won't cooperate in your investigation.
- Why?

08:18.965 --> 08:21.627
Just... go away.

08:28.207 --> 08:30.300
Not... Not here.

08:44.724 --> 08:48.387
Someone got to the police chief.
Ranheim was hiding something.

08:48.461 --> 08:51.225
- Ranheim was sick.
- He became sick last night.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.389
Excuse me, could I use your pen?

08:54.867 --> 08:57.768
You think Gulf War Syndrome
is caused by UFOs?

08:57.837 --> 09:01.068
UFOs are often witnessed by soldiers
during wartime.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.476
Thanks.

09:04.610 --> 09:10.810
Mulder, the only UFOs that soldiers are
likely to see are secret military aircraft.

09:10.883 --> 09:16.287
That's what made soldiers in Iraq sick: Fuel or
exhaust of a classified aircraft or its weapon.

09:19.058 --> 09:23.552
There is a base in Little Rock. You think
that's what the Air Force was flying?

09:23.663 --> 09:28.691
They'd deny it. But it could possibly explain
how Ranheim developed the symptoms.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.428
Possibly.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.666
I'll talk to some people
when we get back to Washington.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.708
The military won't discuss classified aircraft.

09:36.809 --> 09:41.576
They're a government watchdog group.
They publish The Lone Gunman magazine.

09:41.681 --> 09:45.515
They have information on
covert actions, classified weapons.

09:45.651 --> 09:48.313
Some of their ideas are downright spooky.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.286
Check it out, Mulder.

09:52.391 --> 09:55.326
- I met the guy who shot John F Kennedy.
- Is that so?

09:55.428 --> 09:59.330
Old dude now, but yeah. Says he was
dressed as a cop on the grassy knoll.

09:59.432 --> 10:04.995
Mulder, listen to this. Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
leader of the Russian Social Democrats?

10:05.071 --> 10:08.472
He's being put in power by
the most evil force of the century.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.634
Barney?

10:11.611 --> 10:14.205
The CIA.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.748
Is this your sceptical partner?

10:18.017 --> 10:20.076
She's hot.

10:20.152 --> 10:24.452
The CIA, threatened by a loss of power
since the collapse of the Cold War,

10:24.523 --> 10:27.219
wouldn't dream of having
the old enemy back?

10:27.293 --> 10:30.626
You give the government too much credit.

10:32.098 --> 10:36.535
- The government can't control a deficit...
- Lone Gunman.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.730
What makes you think they can
plan an elaborate conspiracy?

10:39.839 --> 10:42.467
- She is hot.
- Settle down, Frohike.

10:42.541 --> 10:46.307
We're not talking about
a bunch of idiots up on the hill.

10:46.379 --> 10:51.373
We're talking about a government within
a government, controlling our every move.

10:51.484 --> 10:55.250
- How can they do that?
- How? I'll show you how. You got a $20 bill?

10:57.890 --> 10:59.517
I'll check.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.260
Hey!

11:15.207 --> 11:19.268
That's just one method.
They use this magnetic strip to track you.

11:19.345 --> 11:25.079
You pass through an airport metal detector
and they know exactly what you're carrying.

11:25.151 --> 11:29.588
- It is a federal crime to deface money.
- The strip is an anti-counterfeiting measure.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.385
Other countries put that strip on the outside.

11:32.491 --> 11:36.689
OK! All right. What do you know
about the Gulf War Syndrome?

11:36.796 --> 11:40.562
- Agent Orange of the '90s.
- Artillery shells made with depleted uranium.

11:40.633 --> 11:44.967
Have you heard of classified planes
being flown during the Persian Gulf War?

11:45.037 --> 11:49.838
Why expose a secret plane to an air force that
runs to Iran whenever you take to the air?

11:49.942 --> 11:53.241
What about UFO activity during that period?

11:53.345 --> 11:56.178
UFOs caused Gulf War Syndrome!
That's a good one!

11:56.248 --> 11:59.217
Mulder, your ideas are weirder than ours!

12:01.854 --> 12:05.187
Those were the most paranoid people
I have ever met.

12:05.257 --> 12:08.590
How can you think that
what they say is remotely plausible?

12:08.661 --> 12:12.427
It's remotely plausible
that someone might think you're hot.

12:17.203 --> 12:20.331
Did you see the way
they answered the telephone?

12:22.007 --> 12:27.343
They probably think every call they get is
monitored and they're followed everywhere.

12:27.413 --> 12:32.282
It's a form of self-delusion. Makes them
think that what they do is important...

12:35.821 --> 12:38.415
What's the matter?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.549
Hello?

14:03.876 --> 14:07.835
Pitchers and catchers
report for spring training this week.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.347
Yeah. What are we doing here?!

14:12.051 --> 14:14.645
Missed your calling, did you, Mr Mulder?

14:16.055 --> 14:19.513
Maybe this year
we can catch a game at Candleton Yards.

14:20.392 --> 14:23.452
Of course, we wouldn't be able to sit
together.

14:23.529 --> 14:28.523
That's too bad. Something tells me you'd
have the connections to get great seats.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.364
Yeah...

14:30.469 --> 14:32.369
Any park in the country.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.574
It's just a tourist.

14:37.743 --> 14:41.873
In our line, nothing is just what it seems.

14:43.515 --> 14:47.576
What am I on to? We go to investigate
a truck driver's encounter with a UFO.

14:47.686 --> 14:52.521
Next thing, we discover electronic
surveillance equipment. Who's listening?

14:55.961 --> 14:57.189
Why won't you tell me?

15:08.173 --> 15:09.800
What am I on to?

15:12.311 --> 15:14.370
A dangerous path.

15:43.208 --> 15:46.371
The truck is bogus.
So's the truck driver, Ranheim.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.538
First, I checked his manifest.

15:48.614 --> 15:53.483
It listed a truck carrying 108 cartons
of auto parts weighing 3100 pounds.

15:53.585 --> 15:58.682
I checked with three weigh stations along
his route. They have it listed at 5100 pounds.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.158
There's something in that truck,
and it's not auto parts.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.957
And, of course, nobody ever reported him.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.760
And Ranheim lied to us
about being in the Gulf War.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.301
His real name is Frank Druce.

16:10.402 --> 16:12.666
And I worked hard to get this one.

16:12.771 --> 16:16.673
He was Special Operations Black Beret
in Mosul, Northern Iraq.

16:16.775 --> 16:20.438
Also, he didn't get sick
from the encounter the other night.

16:20.512 --> 16:24.812
He's been to the VA hospital for treatments
three times in the past year.

16:24.883 --> 16:26.043
We had it!

16:27.086 --> 16:28.610
We had it and we let it go.

16:32.491 --> 16:36.325
Four days ago,
an Iraqi Air Force pilot shot down a UFO.

16:36.428 --> 16:40.728
The wreckage, and possibly the occupants,
were recovered by the Army.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.267
Ranheim would be a perfect escort

16:43.335 --> 16:48.705
for the wreckage, and/or bodies, out of Iraq
to a laboratory in the United States.

16:48.807 --> 16:52.868
That would explain why the truck
weighed so much more than listed.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.038
The military has, in the past,

16:55.114 --> 16:59.949
transported dangerous materials and
weapons in unmarked trucks across the US.

17:00.052 --> 17:04.250
- I sound like the The Lone Gunman guys.
- Where did you get this information?

17:04.323 --> 17:07.723
Let's just say
it's a source with a deep background.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.922
- I want to know all about him.
- He's guided us away from harm.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.093
How do you know that?

17:17.169 --> 17:20.695
We work for the FBI and we're being bugged.
What does that tell you?

17:20.772 --> 17:24.071
That tells me that not everything
is as it appears to be.

17:24.143 --> 17:29.103
Exactly! And for all we know, this deep
background is responsible for the bug.

17:29.181 --> 17:31.308
He's never lied to me.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.079
I won't break that confidence. I trust him.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.678
Mulder, you're the only one I trust.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.715
Then you're gonna have to trust me.

17:41.927 --> 17:45.090
Did you find out where the truck is now?

17:45.164 --> 17:47.291
Generally. It's heading west.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.459
Towards Colorado.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.504
We'll try to intercept it
and see what's on board.

17:52.571 --> 17:57.304
I'll pick up a few things.
I'll meet you at your place in an hour. OK?

18:14.193 --> 18:16.354
I cut the main breaker.

18:25.003 --> 18:29.372
- You risk exposure coming here.
- What I have here is too important.

18:30.742 --> 18:35.008
This photograph was taken
by an officer at Fort Benning, Georgia.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.242
Seventeen UFOs were spotted in one hour.

18:38.383 --> 18:41.409
Is that where the Iraqi wreckage
is being held?

18:41.520 --> 18:43.579
Are UFOs monitoring the area?

18:45.224 --> 18:47.317
Nice place you have here.

18:51.463 --> 18:55.991
Wait. Wait... I-I... just want to...
take this opportunity to thank you.

18:56.068 --> 19:00.232
You've helped my work so much, and
you've never asked for anything in return.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.830
I know you've put yourself
at great risk to do so.

19:31.703 --> 19:35.070
This is the best photographic evidence
I have ever seen.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.109
When I saw the Gulf Breeze photos,
I knew they were a hoax.

19:38.210 --> 19:42.010
But this is the quality of evidence
the government has amassed

19:42.080 --> 19:44.878
at the highest classified levels.

19:44.983 --> 19:48.612
The truck was a decoy
to keep anyone looking closely

19:48.687 --> 19:51.485
away from Fort Benning,
where the Iraqi UFO is.

19:51.590 --> 19:55.583
- We've got to leave for Georgia immediately.
- This photo is a fake.

19:55.661 --> 19:56.719
What?

19:56.828 --> 19:58.887
Look.

20:00.265 --> 20:04.099
This soldier's shadow is allegedly created
by the lights from the UFO.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.866
But it falls in a direction
contradictory to the craft's position.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.876
There could be an off-camera light source
creating that shadow.

20:11.944 --> 20:15.846
Look closely at the color of the light
reflected in the windshield.

20:15.914 --> 20:21.409
It should be from the red lights of the UFO,
but it doesn't match the color.

20:21.520 --> 20:26.048
There could be a tint in the windshield, or
it could be due to atmospheric conditions.

20:26.124 --> 20:30.117
- Mulder, we should have it analyzed.
- You're determined not to believe him!

20:30.229 --> 20:32.356
You're too determined to believe him!

20:32.464 --> 20:34.557
I am determined to follow a lead

20:34.666 --> 20:38.966
that may prove the existence
of extraterrestrial biological entities.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.299
- Listen...
- No!

20:40.372 --> 20:42.306
Will you just hear me?!

20:43.742 --> 20:48.975
I have never met anyone so passionate
and dedicated to a belief as you.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.448
It's so intense that sometimes it's blinding.

20:53.652 --> 20:57.110
But there are others who are watching you,
who know what I know, and,

20:57.756 --> 21:02.557
whereas I can respect and admire
your passion, they will use it against you.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.722
Mulder, the truth is out there.

21:07.332 --> 21:09.391
But so are lies.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.296
Thank you.

22:06.191 --> 22:10.651
I had the photo analyzed by the Bureau's
computers. It appears to be legitimate.

22:10.762 --> 22:15.961
The photo-grain matches the pattern
and density... the color level, shading...

22:16.034 --> 22:19.834
Then I noticed this.
It's the moon, half full.

22:20.572 --> 22:25.032
I had the reflection in this window
enlarged by 25. There's the moon again.

22:25.143 --> 22:27.202
A quarter full.

22:27.279 --> 22:31.045
The window couldn't catch
the moon's reflection from that angle.

22:31.149 --> 22:34.346
You were right, Scully. It's a fake.

22:34.419 --> 22:36.478
He tried to deceive us.

22:37.556 --> 22:38.887
Now we're alone on this.

22:39.991 --> 22:42.050
There's no one we can trust.

22:42.894 --> 22:46.352
They went to a lot of trouble
to put us on the wrong track.

22:46.431 --> 22:50.094
There's something here
that no one's supposed to find.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.181
Why didn't you leave for Fort Benning?

23:07.853 --> 23:09.912
The photograph was a fake.

23:10.889 --> 23:15.383
At least you're not insulting me further
by feigning appalled surprise.

23:15.460 --> 23:20.295
On the contrary, I think a compliment is in
order. That photo was prepared by the best.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.731
- I thought you were my ally.
- I am.

23:22.834 --> 23:26.998
Imagine if Eisenhower told the Allies
that D-day would happen in Belgium.

23:27.072 --> 23:30.906
Mr Mulder, I place my life in greatjeopardy
every time we speak!

23:35.046 --> 23:38.504
I've been a participant
in some of the most insidious lies

23:38.617 --> 23:41.848
and witness to deeds
that no crazed man could imagine.

23:41.920 --> 23:46.755
I've spent years watching you
from my... lofty position,

23:46.858 --> 23:49.850
to know that you were the one I could trust.

23:49.928 --> 23:53.227
- Then why did you lie to me?
- I needed to divert you.

23:54.232 --> 23:58.896
You and Scully are excellent investigators,
and your motives are just.

23:58.970 --> 24:03.270
However, there still exist some secrets
which should remain secret.

24:03.341 --> 24:06.504
Truths that people are just not ready to know.

24:06.578 --> 24:09.046
Who are you to decide that for me?

24:09.915 --> 24:13.976
The world's reaction to such knowledge
would be far too dangerous.

24:14.085 --> 24:17.919
Dangerous?
You mean, in the sense of outrage?

24:17.989 --> 24:21.390
Like the reaction to
the Kennedy assassination, or MIAs,

24:21.493 --> 24:25.190
or radiation experiments
on terminal patients. Watergate,

24:25.297 --> 24:29.734
Iran Contra, Roswell, the Tuskegee
experiments... Where will it end?!

24:32.604 --> 24:37.132
I guess it won't end, as long as
men like you decide what is truth.

24:38.944 --> 24:44.405
That transcript you gave me of the Iraqi file -
that was the truth, wasn't it?

24:44.516 --> 24:47.007
Why did you even bother to show it to me?

24:47.619 --> 24:50.588
Well, I was aware that
you were on to the truck.

24:50.689 --> 24:54.352
So I knew that down the road
I would have to steer you away,

24:54.426 --> 24:56.519
that I would have to lie to you.

24:56.595 --> 25:01.555
And a lie, Mr Mulder, is most convincingly
hidden between two truths.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.330
Mulder!

25:08.106 --> 25:10.700
If the shark stops swimming, it will die.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.405
Don't stop swimming.

25:18.316 --> 25:21.649
I'm not responsible
for the electronic surveillance,

25:21.753 --> 25:24.119
but I do know they can still hear you.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.503
Mulder!

26:55.947 --> 26:58.415
Are you home?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.853
Scully. Hey, I'm glad you dropped by.

27:03.922 --> 27:06.686
I've been thinking about
this whole situation.

27:06.758 --> 27:10.956
I think you're right. I think they won this one
and we should just move on.

27:32.684 --> 27:35.244
I think this time you're right, Mulder.

27:59.711 --> 28:02.202
All right, stick with him.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.539
Hey!

28:43.054 --> 28:47.354
Here you are. A round trip to Chicago.
Here's your credit card.

28:47.425 --> 28:49.985
And the plane departs at Gate 35.

28:50.061 --> 28:53.997
I'd also like a one-way ticket to Los Angeles,
with a stop in Las Vegas.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.999
And for that I'll be paying cash.

30:15.814 --> 30:19.511
I called every weigh station and
Bureau office west of Colorado.

30:19.617 --> 30:22.518
I tied up an air phone for three hours.
I don't speak Japanese,

30:22.620 --> 30:26.750
but I think a man told me to
stick some sushi where the sun don't shine!

30:28.326 --> 30:30.851
My ear's numb from being on hold for hours.

30:30.929 --> 30:33.898
At least we can be sure
they didn't trace our call.

30:33.965 --> 30:36.866
I couldn't find the truck.
Did you have any luck?

30:36.935 --> 30:40.098
Yup. It's heading northwest on l-90.

30:40.171 --> 30:43.072
We have to get a couple of tickets to Seattle.

30:49.581 --> 30:55.042
Think about it. This truck drove across
America. People have passed it on the road.

30:55.119 --> 30:59.886
Probably thought it was hauling auto parts
or furniture, livestock, whatever...

30:59.958 --> 31:04.554
Nobody would have suspected
it was hauling a craft from another world.

31:04.662 --> 31:06.391
Here we go.

31:42.166 --> 31:45.397
Mulder, we've been following
this truck for hours.

31:46.838 --> 31:50.740
Maybe he knows we're following him
and he's taking an evasive route.

31:50.808 --> 31:53.038
If that were the case...

32:14.165 --> 32:16.656
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

32:29.347 --> 32:31.781
Ranheim!

33:11.656 --> 33:13.715
Scully!

33:18.129 --> 33:19.096
Oh, my God!

33:19.197 --> 33:22.894
It was an extraterrestrial
biological entity - alive.

33:24.068 --> 33:25.262
Where did it go?

33:27.472 --> 33:30.464
I think we were just witness
to a rescue mission.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.695
God, Mulder, I can't stop shaking.

33:53.965 --> 33:56.866
What just happened - does it fit the profile?

33:57.568 --> 33:59.866
You're asking me if it was real?

33:59.937 --> 34:02.167
Did we just have a close encounter?

34:06.477 --> 34:08.570
No. It was another hoax.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.779
But how could anyone generate such force?

34:16.788 --> 34:19.951
Whatever they used,
we probably haven't heard of it.

34:20.058 --> 34:24.324
Sound weapons... Stealth helicopter
with an ultra-high intensity light...

34:24.395 --> 34:26.955
There's no evidence that this was a UFO.

34:27.065 --> 34:31.001
So they created this elaborate show
just to deflect us again.

34:31.135 --> 34:33.728
Wouldn't it have been easier for them just...

34:33.804 --> 34:36.967
Just to kill us.
Yeah, I've wondered that myself.

34:38.208 --> 34:42.145
But maybe they're using me against myself,
like you said before.

34:42.213 --> 34:47.583
That I want so badly to believe that I accept
the obvious conclusions and walk away.

34:51.355 --> 34:53.550
Now we have nothing to go on.

34:55.126 --> 34:56.922
No one to turn to.

34:56.994 --> 35:00.430
There's still one player in all this
who hasn't lied to us.

35:00.531 --> 35:03.022
But it's not quite someone we can turn to.

35:03.134 --> 35:05.602
Leverlay and Priest Rapids?

35:06.938 --> 35:08.997
East bank of the Columbia River.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.134
Did you send out a field investigator?

35:13.211 --> 35:16.146
And you can substantiate the sighting?

35:16.214 --> 35:18.580
OK, Nick, thanks a lot.

35:18.716 --> 35:23.585
I've contacted several organizations
that have hotlines for UFO reports.

35:23.721 --> 35:26.212
The Center for UFO Studies in Chicago,

35:26.324 --> 35:31.125
MUFON, NICAP. None of them have ever
reported a week of such activity.

35:31.195 --> 35:34.426
It began in Tennessee,
where Ranheim was encountered.

35:34.532 --> 35:37.433
The sightings follow the path of the truck.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.594
And after last night's hoax...

35:40.771 --> 35:42.466
Look at this.

35:42.573 --> 35:45.269
Seven sightings in Mattawa, Washington.

35:45.376 --> 35:48.004
- That's 100 miles away.
- Aliens?

35:48.079 --> 35:51.640
Looks like they want their colleague back.

35:54.886 --> 35:58.049
We've driven full circle
through Mattawa twice.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.215
There's nothing here.

36:03.794 --> 36:05.352
What's over there?

36:25.683 --> 36:28.208
That's an intergalactic space greeting.

36:28.286 --> 36:31.585
- It means "Hello, space brothers."
- Good.

36:31.656 --> 36:33.851
- What's going on here?
- A UFO party.

36:33.925 --> 36:38.055
- You've seen UFOs?
- Last two nights. They're drawn to electricity.

36:38.129 --> 36:40.927
They hover over the power plant down there.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.913
This is it. There's Ranheim.

37:05.556 --> 37:09.253
This place has got to have
the highest level of security.

37:09.327 --> 37:12.660
It's just the kind of challenge
they're looking for.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.857
Who?

37:21.906 --> 37:25.535
- Lone Gunman.
- It's Mulder. Turn the tape recorder off.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.671
- OK. It's off.
- Turn it off!

37:29.747 --> 37:31.271
It's off already!

37:31.349 --> 37:33.283
How would you like to have

37:33.351 --> 37:37.583
the first substantiated photo of
an extraterrestrial biological entity?

37:37.688 --> 37:41.488
No way! An EBE?!
What do we have to do?

37:41.559 --> 37:43.720
Hack me some identification numbers.

37:49.667 --> 37:51.965
Braidwood and Stefoff.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.263
Personal ID number?

37:56.340 --> 37:57.807
7-5-9-3.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.466
5-3-1-1.

38:00.711 --> 38:02.144
Open the trunk, please.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.019
Park in lot 4.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.389
Thanks.

38:29.106 --> 38:31.165
Hey, wait!

38:33.244 --> 38:35.144
Display these at all times.

38:36.847 --> 38:39.441
Proceed.

38:54.231 --> 38:57.667
Langly said he couldn't gain access
to Level 6, so that's...

39:14.552 --> 39:18.215
- We have to go back to get through that door.
- We'll look suspicious.

39:18.289 --> 39:22.055
- We have to find other access, then.
- Mulder, they're not gonna let us!

39:24.895 --> 39:28.092
- Could you folks come with me, please?
- We're lost...

39:28.199 --> 39:30.429
- Just proceed down the hallway.
- If you...

39:30.501 --> 39:32.594
Mulder. Stop.

39:33.504 --> 39:37.406
We're agents for the FBI.
I'm reaching for my ID.

39:38.909 --> 39:43.710
- We're conducting an investigation.
- Proceed down the hallway, please.

39:48.419 --> 39:50.478
This is Level 2 to Level 6.

39:50.588 --> 39:53.455
I have a male and a female
who've identified...

39:53.524 --> 39:54.855
Hey! Stop!

39:54.925 --> 39:57.086
Hold it!

40:02.199 --> 40:04.258
He took the stairs! Go! Go!

40:32.463 --> 40:33.930
Move! Move!

40:34.031 --> 40:35.862
Hold it!

40:35.933 --> 40:38.458
I said, hold it!

40:39.904 --> 40:41.963
Whoa!

40:46.177 --> 40:48.270
Let him go.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.475
Let him go!

40:53.551 --> 40:55.644
You've done well.

40:55.719 --> 40:57.778
You're dismissed.

41:07.665 --> 41:09.656
I know how badly

41:09.733 --> 41:14.864
how... very badly
you want to look through that window.

41:14.939 --> 41:17.772
But it would be pointless.

41:17.875 --> 41:19.570
It's dead.

41:22.913 --> 41:25.814
After the Roswell incident in 1947,

41:25.916 --> 41:28.407
even at the brink of the Cold War,

41:28.519 --> 41:32.319
there was an ultra-secret conference,
attended by the US,

41:32.389 --> 41:35.756
the Soviet Union,
the People's Republic of China, Britain,

41:35.826 --> 41:37.919
both Germanys, France...

41:37.995 --> 41:40.088
And it was agreed that,

41:40.197 --> 41:44.827
should any extraterrestrial
biological entities survive a crash,

41:44.935 --> 41:51.135
the country that held that being
would be responsible for its extermination.

41:54.812 --> 41:56.803
I...

41:56.914 --> 42:02.250
have the distinction of being one of three
men to have exterminated such a creature.

42:04.622 --> 42:06.920
I was with the CIA in Vietnam.

42:07.958 --> 42:11.325
A UFO was sighted for five nights over Hanoi.

42:11.395 --> 42:14.853
The Marines shot it down
and brought it to us.

42:18.068 --> 42:22.767
Maybe... it didn't know what a gun was.

42:22.840 --> 42:25.604
Or perhaps they don't show emotion.

42:27.645 --> 42:30.045
But that

42:30.147 --> 42:34.948
innocent and blank expression
as I pulled the trigger

42:35.019 --> 42:37.544
has haunted me.

42:39.356 --> 42:41.051
Until I found you.

42:42.359 --> 42:44.452
That's why I come to you, Mr Mulder,

42:44.562 --> 42:46.996
and will continue to come to you,

42:47.164 --> 42:51.066
to atone for what I've done.

42:51.168 --> 42:53.602
And maybe sometime,

42:53.671 --> 42:57.300
through you, the truth will be known.

43:36.714 --> 43:39.148
You're awfully quiet, Mr Mulder.

43:42.820 --> 43:45.516
I'm wondering which lie to believe.
