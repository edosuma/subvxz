ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,

00:03.394 --> 00:06.049
a crazy new fad
known as karaoke
swept the nation.

00:06.136 --> 00:09.966
My sister Erica was about
to discover its wonders.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.794
Geoff, stop rearranging
my nail polish.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.578
But you're gonna
love my new system.Forget that.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.841
They just opened
a karaoke place in Jenkintown.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.539
Kara
Oke.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.976
It's the ancient Japanese art
of singing other people's
pop songs.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.456
Well, what if you don't
know the words?You don't have to.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.153
They give them to you
on a video monitor

00:23.240 --> 00:25.721
over vaguely scenic images
of Asian models
frolicking in the ocean.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.723
But what if you can't sing
and have crippling
stage fright?

00:27.810 --> 00:30.465
Well, that doesn't apply
to me, therefore it's a dumb
question, so let's go.

00:30.552 --> 00:31.814
Well, you said nothing
to make me feel better,

00:31.901 --> 00:33.903
but I sense your enthusiasm,
so let's do this.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.819
♪ Baa-baa bamba

a little too much.

Hey, guys. I'm glad
you're having fun,

00:51.573 --> 00:53.053
but there's
a bachelorette party
over there

00:53.140 --> 00:54.402
that is hoping to get
a chance to sing.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.534
Wait, do you work here?
Work and own.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.928

No, actually,
it's Gary Globberman.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.932
Well, it's so awesome
to be singing onstage,

01:03.019 --> 01:05.456
and all I got to do is figure
out a way to get paid for it.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.502
Well, actually, I am looking
to hire a few people.

01:07.589 --> 01:08.894
Wait, you'll pay me
to sing here onstage

01:08.981 --> 01:10.853
until I get discovered
by the A&R scouts

01:10.940 --> 01:12.724
who will give me
a record deal
and then I'll go solo

01:12.811 --> 01:14.770
and leave my less-talented
band mates in the dust?

01:14.857 --> 01:17.077
This is all happening so fast!
You're gonna be so famous!

01:17.164 --> 01:18.948
Sure. But let's
talk turkey, Gar.

ADULT ADAM:
It was October 10th,
1980-something,

03:01.746 --> 03:03.226
the day Pops
was about to learn

03:03.313 --> 03:05.489
about the raddest movie
of my generation.

03:05.576 --> 03:06.925
What you watching, kiddos?

03:07.012 --> 03:08.710
This is Rad,

03:08.797 --> 03:12.017
the story of an awesome
BMX biker named Cru Jones

03:12.104 --> 03:13.497
who enters
a corrupt promoter's

03:13.584 --> 03:15.673
nationally televised
cash-prize race.

03:15.760 --> 03:20.112
This movie has it all.
Rad BMX bikers
on rad BMX bikes

03:20.200 --> 03:22.202
doing
rad BMX biking.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.595
It's why they called it Rad.
They literally had no choice.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.381
Wow!
That's fantastic.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.600
I need a copy
of this right away.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.385
I'm on it.
Go, kiddo.

03:31.472 --> 03:35.302
Okay, he ran off 'cause
I acted insanely excited.

03:35.389 --> 03:38.000
We got to talk.
If you're here to tell us
we're impulsive idiots

03:38.087 --> 03:40.394
and too young to get married
on a mere whim,
then take a number.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.396
No. In honor of
your engagement,

03:42.483 --> 03:44.876
I'm giving you
a nice little nest egg.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.400
Your grandfather
is giving us
actual money?

03:46.487 --> 03:48.053
Boom!
We're rich.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.577
Is this money from
the olden times,

03:49.664 --> 03:51.535
'cause I have no idea
what I'm looking at.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.058
That's a savings bond.

03:53.145 --> 03:58.150
And with interest, one day,
it'll be worth 2,000 big ones.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.067
What if our interest
is in getting money right now
at this moment?

04:02.154 --> 04:05.375
You can't. Right now,
it's only worth 500 bucks.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.724
Boom!
We're rich.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.944

But we can.
Now that I'm rad,

07:10.386 --> 07:12.475

how can you be so selfish?

07:20.091 --> 07:22.659

I farted into the couch.

07:22.746 --> 07:25.096
Dude,
you got a keytar?

07:25.183 --> 07:26.489
Everyone's right.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.317
We really are just impulsive,
immature idiots.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.275
Don't say that.
We can fix this.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.234

our stuff and get our
nest egg back.

nest egg, please.

07:40.851 --> 07:44.246
What? The nest egg
is gone already?
It's been four hours.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.596
It's kind of a funny story,
really.

07:46.683 --> 07:49.338
It's hard not to buy stuff
when you really want
to buy stuff.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.122
That's not funny
or a story.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.603
So that's a yes on giving us
a second, bigger nest egg?

07:53.690 --> 07:54.909
That's a no!

Why can't everyone just throw
money at our problems?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.697
Yeah, he's right.
Do that.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.960
No, if you two want
to be adults,

08:03.047 --> 08:05.136
you're gonna have to learn
how not to spend.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.530
Look at me. I haven't spent
in the past 20 years.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.358
Those are the only pants
I've ever seen you wear.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.708
Just got the one.
Don't even fit right.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.405
So you saved money
on pants.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.582
Your wife is a shopaholic.

08:15.669 --> 08:18.846
All Mom ever does
is spend money on hair spray
and bags of shredded cheese.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.630
Exactly.

08:20.717 --> 08:23.241
In every marriage, you've
got a spender and a saver.

08:23.328 --> 08:24.808
That way,
it all evens out.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.723
Well, I love Lainey
more than anything,

08:26.810 --> 08:29.160
so I'll take the bullet.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.728
Baby, I'm gonna be
the penny-pinching cheapskate

08:31.815 --> 08:33.556
just like my garbage bag
of a father.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.602
No. Barry,
he's the worst.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.343
He truly is,
and I will lower myself

08:38.430 --> 08:41.738
to his hideous, carbuncled
depths for our love.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.915
It just fills my heart
that you'd sink
so unbelievably low for me.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.744
It's literally impossible
to sink any lower.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.050
I love you.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.660
I am super angry,

08:50.747 --> 08:53.358
but, also,
I've never been more proud.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.578
ADULT ADAM: As Barry
was making our dad's
dreams come true,

08:55.665 --> 08:58.320
Erica was ready
to give our mom
her greatest fantasy.

08:58.407 --> 09:01.366
Hey, look who it is,
my favorite gal pal.

09:01.453 --> 09:04.108
You just said it.
Say it again.
Say "gal pal."

09:04.195 --> 09:05.936
No, but I did want
to thank you

09:06.023 --> 09:07.590
for actually
showing me respect

09:07.677 --> 09:09.418
and giving me
the space I needed.

09:09.505 --> 09:12.247
Well, who knew
treating you like an adult
would feel so good?

09:12.334 --> 09:16.164
Mark my words,
I will never butt into
your life ever again.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.688
Wow, those truly are words
I've always dreamt of hearing,

09:18.775 --> 09:21.909
which makes this next part
especially hard to say,

09:21.996 --> 09:25.042
but I need you to
come to karaoke
and bring all your friends.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.740
Wha
I know it's really
confusing,

09:26.827 --> 09:28.437
but I want you
to come to karaoke,

09:28.524 --> 09:29.612
and you can stay
as long as you want.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.658
Daughter want time?
Me

09:31.745 --> 09:33.311
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to reboot your brain,

09:33.398 --> 09:35.618
because there will be a few
ground rules here, understood?

09:35.705 --> 09:38.099
Ah, come on, man.
Whatta what?

09:38.186 --> 09:40.623
The general idea is you don't
embarrass me by being you.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.886
Huh Huh?
So that means no
haranguing my boss

09:42.973 --> 09:44.235
or complaining
about the service

09:44.322 --> 09:46.673
or sending back food
or using expired coupons,

09:46.760 --> 09:48.936
and for God's sake,
no mom dancing.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.328
What's mom dancing?

09:50.415 --> 09:51.199
Go on. Bust a move.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.291
Yeah, that. None of that.

09:56.378 --> 09:59.642
Also, there will be no
mother/daughter duets ever.

09:59.729 --> 10:02.384
Oh, well, tell that to
the Judds, but fine.

10:02.471 --> 10:04.168
To clarify, there's
no singing at all,

10:04.255 --> 10:06.431
because you'll just
destroy the vibe with
your lame mom songs.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.955
And what are mom songs?

10:08.042 --> 10:09.347
Anything
by Bette, Babs,

10:09.434 --> 10:11.132
The Beach Boys,
or Barry Manilow.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.351
No doo-wop, no bebop,
no power-pop,

10:13.438 --> 10:15.571
and, you know what,
just no songs at all.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.747
No singing. Got it.

10:17.834 --> 10:21.446
All that matters here
is I agreed to stay out
of your life,

10:21.533 --> 10:23.361
but the truth is
you want me in it.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.889

this is a huge mistake.

Okay. Here's a list
of everything you need
to know to save a buck.

10:40.770 --> 10:44.992
And, as an extra incentive,
for every dollar you save
in this house,

10:45.079 --> 10:46.907
I put it
right in your nest egg.

10:46.994 --> 10:50.388
Yes! I'm gonna be

Really
Oh, my God!

That's why
I'm always screaming
about the thermostat.

You do?
That's all I do!

10:59.789 --> 11:03.010
I've honestly never
heard you say anything
about the thermostat, ever.

11:03.097 --> 11:04.881
You know no one touches
that thermostat.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.275
Don't touch
the damn thermostat.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.755

listening now.Good.

11:15.152 --> 11:17.938
Because this next one's
a biggie, electricity.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.722
No more highfalutin
microwave.

11:19.809 --> 11:22.812
But heating up a pizza
in the oven takes six more
agonizing minutes.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.074
Would you rather
have a slow pizza

11:24.161 --> 11:26.903
or money for more pizza?
Hold on.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.993
Are you saying
if I save money,
I'll have more of it?

11:30.080 --> 11:32.039
It seems obvious,
but, yes.

11:32.126 --> 11:35.433
Okay, next,
always save water.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.435
Wait, isn't water free
'cause God makes it?

11:37.522 --> 11:38.698
No, dumb-dumb.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.482
A water bill
can cost a fortune.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.266
So get used to cold showers,

11:42.353 --> 11:43.833
dry-brushing your teeth,

11:43.920 --> 11:46.227

in emergencies.

was it free or very cheap?

So, give it to me.
How much
we put away this week?

15:03.859 --> 15:06.688

seven and a million dollars.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.081
Is it seven?
It's six.

15:08.168 --> 15:09.473
That's one worse
than seven,

15:09.560 --> 15:10.692

give it as an option!

15:10.779 --> 15:13.129

15:13.216 --> 15:15.479

But isn't there another way?

15:15.566 --> 15:18.439
Of course there is.
We keep
living extravagantly,

15:18.526 --> 15:21.094
and when we do need money,
we quickly earn a ton of it.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.357

it made perfect sense.
