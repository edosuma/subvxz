WEBVTT

00:06.600 --> 00:08.250
SAM: <i>My family hunts. It's what we do.</i>

00:12.920 --> 00:13.921
Let's begin.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.447
<i>Toni Bevell, Men of Letters,
London Chapterhouse.</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:19.649
If you answer my questions,
you'll walk right out that door.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.450
SAM:
<i>I've been tortured by the Devil himself.</i>

00:21.600 --> 00:22.761
<i>What can you do to me?</i>

00:27.880 --> 00:30.804
TONI: <i>The Winchesters are no better
than the monsters they fail to control.</i>

00:30.960 --> 00:32.290
<i>They need to be eliminated.</i>

00:33.320 --> 00:34.606
Aren't we supposed to be on the same team?

00:35.280 --> 00:36.361
Get away from my boys.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.806
- Mom?
- Yeah.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.889
No argument, Lady Bevell went too far.
I deeply apologize.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.804
We wanna work with you. My number.

00:46.960 --> 00:47.961
I found a case.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.645
DEAN: <i>If Mom wants to hunt, I say we hunt.</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:55.002
<i>MARY: I've heard of people
coming back from the dead before.</i>

00:55.200 --> 00:56.201
But actually do it...

00:56.360 --> 00:58.044
<i>I just have a lot of blanks to fill in.</i>

00:58.520 --> 00:59.521
I have to go.

00:59.680 --> 01:00.966
BILLIE: <i>It's always nice
to see a Winchester</i>

01:01.160 --> 01:02.321
<i>who can't get what he wants.</i>

01:02.480 --> 01:03.686
DEAN: <i>Billie. She's a reaper.</i>

01:03.840 --> 01:06.241
See, I'm a big believer in what dies...

01:06.640 --> 01:07.721
DEAN: <i>Sam!</i>

01:08.240 --> 01:09.241
BILLIE: <i>stays dead.</i>

01:09.400 --> 01:10.640
Stop it! Dean.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.650
If any of you change your minds,
you know my name.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.684
CROWLEY:
<i>Got to put Lucifer back in the cage.</i>

01:16.840 --> 01:20.481
<i>I think I know the identity
of Lucifer's newest vessel.</i>

01:20.680 --> 01:24.287
<i>Jefferson Rooney,
President of these United States.</i>

01:24.480 --> 01:26.687
I just know you'd make an amazing father.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.205
A Nephilim is come into being.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.010
<i>It's the offspring
of an angel and a human.</i>

01:30.160 --> 01:31.161
SAM: <i>Lucifer.</i>

01:31.840 --> 01:35.367
So, you're gonna pop Lucifer
out of the President with that.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.727
DEAN: <i>I hope so. Otherwise we're all dead.</i>

01:40.920 --> 01:43.127
You're under arrest
for the attempted assassination

01:43.280 --> 01:45.044
<i>of the President of the United States.</i>

01:45.200 --> 01:46.201
DEAN: <i>It's not like we're in the</i>

01:46.360 --> 01:48.249
<i>live-till-you're-90,
die-in-your-sleep business.</i>

01:48.400 --> 01:49.526
<i>This only ends one way.</i>

02:15.480 --> 02:18.245
- Castiel?
- Mary, where are you?

02:21.400 --> 02:22.925
Lawrence, Kansas.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.364
Cass, what's wrong?

02:28.760 --> 02:30.444
<i>I need you to meet me at the bunker.</i>

02:47.960 --> 02:50.361
Six hours ago, Sam and Dean Winchester

02:50.560 --> 02:52.449
tried to kill
the President of the United States.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.482
Huh. Do we know why?

02:55.640 --> 02:57.290
They haven't said a word
since we picked 'em up.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.811
CAMP: <i>Quiet types, okay.
What do we know about them?</i>

03:04.960 --> 03:06.803
RICK: <i>A lot. Brothers.</i>

03:06.960 --> 03:10.089
Born in Lawrence, Kansas,
to Mary Winchester, deceased,

03:10.520 --> 03:12.329
and John Winchester, also deceased.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.571
FBI started investigating back in 2007.

03:15.920 --> 03:16.967
For what?

03:17.120 --> 03:20.761
Assault, murder,
multiple counts of desecrating a corpse.

03:21.520 --> 03:22.567
The same corpse?

03:25.240 --> 03:27.208
No, different corpses.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.806
<i>They made the FBI's Most Wanted in 2011,</i>

03:30.960 --> 03:33.440
<i>then died in a shootout
with police in Ankeny, Iowa.</i>

03:33.600 --> 03:35.807
<i>At least that's what their file said,
but apparently not.</i>

03:36.080 --> 03:39.084
- Apparently. What about the girl?
- Kelly Kline.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.487
<i>She's a Presidential aide,
but no one's seen her since that day.</i>

03:41.640 --> 03:43.324
<i>We don't know where she went,
or if she's still alive.</i>

03:44.320 --> 03:47.085
CAMP: <i>How many people know about this?</i>
RICK: <i>We're keeping it quiet.</i>

03:47.440 --> 03:50.046
Just you, me, the agents
who made the arrest, and POTUS.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.082
<i>But the last thing he remembers
was saying his nightly prayers,</i>

03:53.240 --> 03:54.366
<i>three days before it happened.</i>

03:54.520 --> 03:55.760
Drugged?

03:55.960 --> 03:58.167
Lab's running a tox screen now,
but, yeah, probably.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.808
<i>And by "probably," you mean "maybe,"</i>

04:00.960 --> 04:05.841
and by "maybe," you mean "I don't know."
So, next time, just say you don't know.

04:12.520 --> 04:17.447
Look, you're here because
you're some big shot, anti-terrorism guy.

04:17.600 --> 04:21.286
But you want my opinion?
We should take those two psychos out back.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.763
I cap one, you take the other,
we grab an early lunch.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.002
- Yeah?
- They got it coming.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.529
Yeah, but what if
they're not working alone?

04:30.440 --> 04:35.002
I mean, what if these boys have ties to...
I don't know, white nationalists?

04:35.320 --> 04:36.401
Muslim Brotherhood?

04:36.560 --> 04:38.164
- Really?
- Just saying.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.611
They might be the tip
of some nasty-ass iceberg.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.768
- That's what you think?
- Probably.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.370
Maybe. I don't know.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.726
Let's find out.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.651
Hi, Dean. How you doing?

05:03.080 --> 05:06.721
Can I get you coffee, water,
or you hungry?

05:07.400 --> 05:10.131
I got a chocolate bar here somewhere.
Don't tell my wife.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.243
So, you've had a day.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.321
Wanna tell me about it?

05:19.120 --> 05:22.647
Like, for example, why you went after
the leader of the free world?

05:26.320 --> 05:29.005
Let me guess, you don't like cops?

05:29.480 --> 05:32.848
Hell, I get it,
we can be real jackasses,

05:34.280 --> 05:35.645
but you're gonna talk to me, son.

05:36.760 --> 05:39.570
You just are. Now, that's not a threat.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.523
I don't believe in torture, doesn't work.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.406
I've seen folks waterboarded, cut on...

05:48.320 --> 05:50.527
<i>And they talk, they do.</i>

05:51.240 --> 05:53.083
But they never tell you what you need.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.486
<i>You know what does work, though?</i>

05:56.640 --> 05:59.610
Every time? Nothing.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.968
See, when I leave, that door closes,

06:07.920 --> 06:09.445
and it stays closed.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.605
And you stay in the dark.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.244
Now, maybe that doesn't sound so bad.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.047
But after a month, a year?

06:22.440 --> 06:25.125
You spend enough time
staring at these walls,

06:25.600 --> 06:27.443
just you and all that nothing,

06:28.080 --> 06:32.608
you'll get so crazy to talk,
to see someone real,

06:33.160 --> 06:37.324
you'll tell me exactly what I need.
You'll tell me with a smile.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.681
<i>It'll just take some time.</i>

06:44.200 --> 06:47.363
Of course, thing is, after what you did?

06:48.480 --> 06:50.448
No one's in a hurry
to get you that phone call.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.166
So, you and me,
we got all the time in the world.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.688
MICK: <i>This is Mick Davies,
filing Status Update Bravo-3.</i>

08:03.000 --> 08:04.286
<i>As instructed, I've been attempting</i>

08:04.440 --> 08:06.647
<i>to make inroads with the American hunters,</i>

08:06.840 --> 08:09.571
<i>but, unfortunately,
there's been a few setbacks.</i>

08:10.560 --> 08:14.884
Let me paint you a picture
of a world without monsters, or demons,

08:15.240 --> 08:17.402
or any of those little buggers
that go bump in the night,

08:18.240 --> 08:20.846
of a world where no one
has to die because of the supernatural,

08:21.880 --> 08:24.247
of a new world, a better world.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.360
Now, if you work with us,

08:29.520 --> 08:32.091
you'll have support,
in every sense of the word.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.087
You need lore?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.884
Our libraries are
the biggest and the best.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.244
You want money? We have money.
You need weapons?

08:40.280 --> 08:41.725
We have gear you can't even imagine.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.608
Now, what I'm saying, Wally,

08:45.720 --> 08:48.644
is that you need people like us,
and we need hunters like you.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.250
All we ask in return is that when we call,

08:52.400 --> 08:54.164
you go where you're told
and you do what you're told.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.007
For the greater good.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.282
Let me see your hands.
Come on, let me see your hands.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.767
Okay. All right.

09:08.920 --> 09:09.967
Soft.

09:10.960 --> 09:11.961
Mmm. Thank you.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.280
You ever hunt anything?

09:15.760 --> 09:18.411
I'm more tactical, long-term strategy.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.161
Right.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.608
Listen, uh, Mike...

09:23.800 --> 09:24.961
- Mick.
- Whatever.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.601
I don't know you,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.764
and I ain't looking
to take any orders from anyone,

09:30.000 --> 09:33.846
- especially some...
- Limey paper pusher.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.684
- I'm not quite sure you understand, mate.
- No, I think I do.

09:38.840 --> 09:42.162
So, no offense, but you can
take your offer...

09:42.640 --> 09:45.086
And you can...
Shove it up your ass.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.084
I'm sure it won't be too painful,

09:48.760 --> 09:50.967
what with those
soft hands of yours, right?

09:51.520 --> 09:53.090
That's, uh... That's for the burger.

09:58.040 --> 10:01.010
<i>In short, the American hunters have proven</i>

10:01.520 --> 10:02.521
<i>difficult.</i>

10:03.080 --> 10:04.366
<i>As for the Winchesters...</i>

10:05.560 --> 10:06.607
You left them?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.441
No, I...

10:08.840 --> 10:12.128
- Dean told me to go. The woman...
- The one you lost?

10:12.440 --> 10:13.646
I didn't. I...

10:14.600 --> 10:16.921
- I thought that she was just...
- Stop making excuses!

10:24.960 --> 10:25.961
<i>Why...</i>

10:26.720 --> 10:28.484
If they needed help,
why didn't they call me?

10:31.440 --> 10:32.487
You were out.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.210
How did we let this happen, Castiel?

11:13.480 --> 11:14.527
MALE GUARD: <i>Chow time!</i>

11:23.960 --> 11:25.007
<i>Chow time!</i>

11:31.960 --> 11:34.042
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

11:35.960 --> 11:36.961
MALE GUARD: <i>Chow time!</i>

11:41.800 --> 11:42.847
<i>Chow time!</i>

11:45.640 --> 11:46.641
<i>Chow time!</i>

11:50.520 --> 11:51.521
<i>Chow time!</i>

11:57.240 --> 11:58.321
Can't help you.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.082
Come on, Crowley, the police took them.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.329
You have people in the government,
you have spies.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.481
I do,

12:06.160 --> 12:08.322
but whatever's happened
to Moose and Squirrel,

12:08.960 --> 12:10.724
apparently, it's above their pay grade.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.489
Do you even care that they're gone?

12:16.320 --> 12:17.321
No.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.761
Do you know how many all-powerful
beings have tried to kill them?

12:21.840 --> 12:23.968
- Roughly, yes.
- As do I.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.767
I was bloody one of them.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.005
And Sam and Dean, they're like herpes.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.244
Just when you think they're gone,
hello, the boys are back,

12:32.400 --> 12:34.164
leaving a trail of bodies in their wake.

12:35.640 --> 12:40.168
So, wherever they are,
whoever has Sam and Dean...

12:41.040 --> 12:42.041
Well,

12:43.160 --> 12:48.326
in the immortal words of Laurence Tureaud,
"I pity the fool."

13:31.880 --> 13:32.927
ALICIA: <i>Dean?</i>

13:34.000 --> 13:35.001
Uh...

13:35.200 --> 13:36.850
No, he's...

13:37.720 --> 13:39.484
- Mary?
- Yeah.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.049
<i>This is Alicia, Asa's kid?</i>

13:42.400 --> 13:44.243
- Oh.
- Look, I...

13:44.400 --> 13:47.290
<i>Me and my brother,
we're working this case in Louisiana.</i>

13:47.880 --> 13:50.611
<i>We thought it was some
Southern fried werewolf thing,</i>

13:50.760 --> 13:53.570
<i>but it's not one fang, it's a pack.</i>

13:54.280 --> 13:58.171
<i>There's, like, a billion of them
down here, and we need help.</i>

14:01.600 --> 14:02.647
Where are you?

14:52.320 --> 14:53.321
Thanks for meeting me.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.004
I just wanted to say, I'm sorry.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.526
I was angry, and...

15:03.360 --> 15:05.010
Sam and Dean, that's not your fault.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.207
No, you were right.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.291
I should never have left them, I...

15:12.160 --> 15:13.207
Have you heard anything?

15:16.160 --> 15:20.085
All my law enforcement contacts
are retired or dead.

15:24.640 --> 15:25.687
I'm trying, but...

15:27.520 --> 15:28.521
<i>You?</i>

15:32.680 --> 15:34.682
I keep telling myself they're fine.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.684
- They've only been gone...
- Six weeks, two days, and ten hours.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.891
<i>We'll find them, Castiel.</i>

15:45.240 --> 15:46.287
We Will.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.806
Until then, we just...

15:51.480 --> 15:52.481
We're doing our best.

15:53.960 --> 15:54.961
Are we?

15:57.400 --> 15:59.607
Did you hear about the murders
in Lancaster, Missouri?

16:00.400 --> 16:01.401
No.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.570
The women with their throats
ripped out, blood drained.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.007
Vampire.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.721
I saw it on the news, and I thought,

16:10.880 --> 16:13.724
that's the sort of thing
Sam and Dean would investigate.

16:13.880 --> 16:18.727
They would roll into town
and save the day, kill the monsters.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.366
But with them gone...

16:23.320 --> 16:25.368
<i>I tried to work the case, I tried,</i>

16:26.520 --> 16:28.966
but I don't know what I did wrong.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.930
I asked questions,
but maybe they were the wrong people,

16:33.080 --> 16:35.447
or the wrong questions, and I just...

16:36.080 --> 16:37.650
I never found it.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.888
Never found the monster,
never even got close.

16:42.720 --> 16:46.088
And three more women died
before I left town,

16:49.760 --> 16:51.046
before I ran away.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.644
So, we go back. You and me.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.281
No.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.089
No, I'd only get in your way.

17:11.880 --> 17:12.881
Chow time!

17:15.520 --> 17:16.521
Yo, eat up!

17:23.640 --> 17:24.641
Crap.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.281
What happened?

17:28.079 --> 17:29.491
I was doing my rounds, and...

17:29.640 --> 17:31.642
I did CPR, but he was gone.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.283
Get that other cell open. Now!

17:49.600 --> 17:50.601
He's dead.

18:07.840 --> 18:08.887
I don't get it.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.160
They both died on the same day?
That's not...

18:14.680 --> 18:16.808
- How's that even possible?
- You tell us.

18:17.920 --> 18:18.921
Great plan.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.001
For the last two months,
we've done nothing

18:22.200 --> 18:25.363
but sit around with our junk in our hands
because you wanted to "wait them out."

18:26.400 --> 18:27.447
<i>That really worked.</i>

18:28.080 --> 18:30.048
- Yeah, nice job.
- Well, I'm just gonna...

18:31.160 --> 18:32.161
Yeah.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.522
You wanted them dead, they're dead.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.806
I wanted them punished.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.361
I wanted to look
Dean Winchester in the eye, and...

18:42.480 --> 18:43.527
I wanted them to feel it.

18:44.320 --> 18:48.370
Well, then,
that is totally mentally normal.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.807
Go to hell.

19:13.760 --> 19:14.886
MARY: <i>Castiel, it's me.</i>

19:16.160 --> 19:17.207
<i>I'm just calling to...</i>

19:19.400 --> 19:21.289
<i>You don't have to worry
about that thing in Missouri,</i>

19:22.080 --> 19:23.081
<i>I'm handling it.</i>

19:47.280 --> 19:48.281
You good?

19:51.760 --> 19:54.764
Yeah, I've been better. I've been worse.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.441
Looks like it worked.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.121
Yeah, so far.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.651
- How'd...
- Where are we?

20:11.800 --> 20:13.370
- I don't know.
- Answer him!

20:13.560 --> 20:14.607
Seriously!

20:14.760 --> 20:17.969
They blindfold me every day
before they bring me to work.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.641
I...

20:20.520 --> 20:23.444
This place? It's not supposed to exist.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.087
Clear.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.968
- CASTIEL: <i>This is my voicemail.</i>
- Hey, should we take it?

20:53.120 --> 20:55.851
- <i>Make your voicemail.</i>
- Nah, it's probably got LoJack.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.531
- <i>This is my voicemail...</i>
- Come on, Cass!

21:00.680 --> 21:01.727
Got a map.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.845
- What?
- Cass?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.723
<i>- Dean?
- Hey, buddy, long time.</i>

21:14.840 --> 21:15.841
What...

21:16.400 --> 21:18.209
What happened? Where are you?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.522
You wouldn't believe me,
and I have no clue.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.889
Got something.
All right, looks like that's Elk Mountain,

21:24.040 --> 21:26.407
which makes that Longs Peak.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.366
<i>Okay, looks like we're in Colorado.</i>

21:29.520 --> 21:30.806
<i>Rocky Mountain National Park.</i>

21:30.960 --> 21:33.247
If we head north,
we should hit State Route 34,

21:33.680 --> 21:35.011
- eventually.
- Did you get that?

21:35.200 --> 21:36.929
- Yes.
<i>- All right, meet us there.</i>

21:37.840 --> 21:39.171
Wait, where?

21:39.360 --> 21:41.249
Just drive along the road
and you'll see us.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.250
And, Cass, the sooner the better.
We're kinda on the clock here.

21:44.920 --> 21:45.967
Wait, what does that...

21:49.720 --> 21:50.846
- You didn't tell him?
- No.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.604
- They'll track the phone.
- All right.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.446
Castiel? Slow...

22:22.080 --> 22:23.081
Slow down. What?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.681
Oh, God.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.087
The hell?

22:49.920 --> 22:50.967
Hey.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.929
- Here you go.
- This isn't...

23:04.560 --> 23:07.086
I took his pulse. They were dead!

23:08.040 --> 23:09.963
Look, I got no idea what went down here.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.365
Maybe they got to one of the guards.

23:12.520 --> 23:15.364
Maybe this is some
slow-your-heartbeat-kung-fu crap.

23:16.160 --> 23:19.528
What I do know,
the Winchesters are out there.

23:22.080 --> 23:24.048
And this time, we're doing it my way.

23:24.960 --> 23:28.806
All right, we got two runners with
about a 45-minute head start.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.567
<i>These are killers.</i>

23:32.160 --> 23:34.527
So, you get eyes, you pull the trigger.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.927
Let's move out.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.689
- You got here quickly.
- Yup.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.211
What do you think we're walking into?

24:11.200 --> 24:13.885
I don't know. We may want backup.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.047
Crowley, Rowena.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.680
The King of Hell,
and his mother, the witch?

24:20.280 --> 24:21.725
Hope we can do better than that.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.088
- I may have an idea.
- Good.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.046
Seatbelt on. I drive fast.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.889
Long time since
you've been in the field, huh?

24:52.640 --> 24:53.926
I mean, if you need to head back...

24:55.440 --> 24:56.487
I'm fine.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.686
All right, so we got, what,
hour till dark?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.922
Which puts us, what,
six hours till midnight?

25:10.080 --> 25:11.127
That sounds about right.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.403
- Dean, we gotta talk about this.
- Okay, we will. All right? Later.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.166
This is your idea?

25:35.280 --> 25:37.931
The people that almost killed my boys,
they're gonna be our backup?

25:38.640 --> 25:40.881
Suddenly, the demon
and his mommy don't look so bad.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.124
They helped us with Lucifer.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.089
"Lucifer"? The Lucifer?

25:45.520 --> 25:46.567
Yes.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.804
Wait, so you're telling me
what happened in Indianapolis was...

25:49.960 --> 25:51.610
You took on the bleeding Devil himself?

25:52.480 --> 25:53.970
- Yes.
- Did you win?

25:54.680 --> 25:55.761
Yes.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.286
Bravo.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.171
But, Sam and Dean were taken.

26:04.080 --> 26:05.764
We think we can get them back, but we need

26:07.280 --> 26:08.281
help.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.051
So, we'll help.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.487
Really? Just like that?

26:13.080 --> 26:15.321
Mrs. Winchester, Mary,

26:17.080 --> 26:19.924
I came to this country to do one thing,
make friends.

26:20.920 --> 26:24.049
But you American hunters,
you're a different breed than our sort.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.290
You're surly, suspicious,
you don't play well with others.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.727
Well, that is accurate.

26:32.160 --> 26:35.687
You don't trust people you don't know,
even when they come bearing gifts.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.683
Now, I can't help that,
but I can help you.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.610
And if word were to get out
that we did our part

26:43.760 --> 26:45.603
to save Sam and Dean Winchester, well,

26:46.680 --> 26:47.841
that's just good business, innit?

26:49.200 --> 26:50.326
And, who knows?

26:50.480 --> 26:52.323
When all this is over,
we might even be friends.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.246
We think Sam and Dean were being held

27:00.400 --> 27:02.368
somewhere in
the Rocky Mountain National Forest.

27:02.520 --> 27:03.521
Site 94?

27:05.240 --> 27:08.722
It's a government facility, off-books.
Shadow ops.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.241
One of those places
that officially doesn't exist?

27:13.600 --> 27:17.491
- Well, then how do you know about it?
- We gather information. It's our job.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.884
They told us to meet them off
State Route 34.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.930
Well, that's a long stretch of road.
Where, exactly?

27:24.760 --> 27:26.091
I'm not sure.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.322
I'll get our techs to
put a satellite over the area.

27:29.720 --> 27:31.643
- You can do that?
- And so much more.

27:38.160 --> 27:41.289
Do you have any idea what sort
of trouble we're walking into?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.047
No.

27:44.240 --> 27:47.084
Oh, good. I do like a surprise.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.283
- They're on us.
- Yeah. Damn it.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.645
RICK: Norton, come in.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.686
This is Norton, I'm on the ridge...

28:55.080 --> 28:58.163
<i>Norton? Norton, this is Sanchez.
Do you copy?</i>

29:01.760 --> 29:03.205
Norton has gone night-night.

29:04.520 --> 29:05.601
Winchester.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.485
- <i>This the man-in-charge?</i>
- That's right.

29:08.840 --> 29:09.887
Well, let me tell you
how this is gonna go.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.011
You're gonna call your boys,

29:13.720 --> 29:17.008
<i>and you're gonna turn around,
and nobody's gonna get hurt.</i>

29:17.160 --> 29:19.686
No, no. Here's how this is gonna go.

29:20.640 --> 29:25.362
<i>I take my highly-trained soldiers,
track your ass down, and you get hurt,</i>

29:26.160 --> 29:27.207
a lot.

29:28.840 --> 29:32.049
You can't run forever.
You're trapped out here.

29:35.280 --> 29:38.284
Well, what we have here
is a failure to communicate.

29:40.480 --> 29:41.891
<i>'Cause we're not
trapped out here with you,</i>

29:43.320 --> 29:44.765
you're trapped out here with us.

30:02.880 --> 30:03.881
That'll work.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.607
Go!

32:59.960 --> 33:01.041
You'll live.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.687
DEAN: Hey.

33:06.600 --> 33:07.601
Ah!

33:11.520 --> 33:13.807
I told you, trapped.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.485
Camp! Shoot him!

33:23.240 --> 33:26.244
Don't. Hand me the gun.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.247
You want the truth?

33:32.600 --> 33:35.444
The President was possessed by the Devil.

33:36.360 --> 33:37.407
We saved his life.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.281
That's the truth.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.204
Now you can take that
and do what you want with it,

33:45.280 --> 33:48.568
but if you come after us,
you know what'll happen.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.444
CAMP: <i>What... Who are you?</i>

34:03.040 --> 34:04.326
We're the guys that save the world.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.606
Sam! Dean!

34:16.760 --> 34:18.045
- Cass?
- Cass.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.929
- Mom?
- Hey, buddy.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.687
SAM: Mom, how did you all even find us?

34:44.280 --> 34:45.327
They helped.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.321
Hello, lads.

34:48.880 --> 34:53.761
They have a thermal imaging
satellite that saw you from space.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.688
Well, we don't have one,
we just borrowed it for a bit.

34:59.320 --> 35:00.685
Friends in all the right places.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.362
Well, I guess this is where
we're supposed to say thank you.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.409
No need. Happy to be of service.

35:06.560 --> 35:07.607
Again.

35:09.360 --> 35:10.361
Okay, then.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.041
We should get.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.089
The people we left,
they'll call for backup any second.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.368
You left survivors?

35:21.880 --> 35:24.326
They were soldiers,
just doing what they were told.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.404
Still, a bit unprofessional.

35:28.920 --> 35:31.890
We'll handle it. Let's get.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.926
So, wait, you're hunting?

36:02.400 --> 36:03.401
A little bit.

36:04.560 --> 36:05.971
Yeah, I knew you couldn't stay away.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.361
It's time.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.691
What's happening?

36:37.880 --> 36:38.927
BILLIE: Yeah, Dean.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.047
What's up?

36:50.200 --> 36:52.202
- Billie?
- The reaper.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.401
I don't understand.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.001
Mom,

36:59.520 --> 37:00.567
that place,

37:02.960 --> 37:04.405
there was only one way
we were getting out of there,

37:04.560 --> 37:05.641
and that wasn't breathing.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.041
So, I made a call.

37:15.800 --> 37:16.801
Billie?

37:23.040 --> 37:25.281
SAM: <i>Dean talked with her,
and then Billie came to see me,</i>

37:27.400 --> 37:28.481
<i>and we made a deal.</i>

37:30.200 --> 37:34.842
We'd get to die and come back
one more time, but in exchange...

37:35.080 --> 37:38.050
Come midnight, a Winchester goes bye-bye.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.080
Like, permanently.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.483
And that is something I've been
looking forward to for a long time.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.169
- Why would you...
- We were already dead.

37:52.840 --> 37:56.049
Being locked in that cell with nothing?

37:57.360 --> 38:00.364
I've been to Hell. This was worse.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.362
At least this way
one of us gets to keep fighting.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.206
- You don't have to do this.
- Yeah, they do.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.121
<i>We made a pact,</i>

38:17.200 --> 38:18.565
<i>bound in blood.</i>

38:30.840 --> 38:36.085
Break that, there's consequences,
on a cosmic scale.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.121
So, who's it gonna be?

38:43.960 --> 38:44.961
Me.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.121
- Mom...
- No.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.361
- Mom.
- No.

38:49.400 --> 38:54.486
You said come midnight, a Winchester dies.
I'm a Winchester.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.401
Works for me.

38:58.640 --> 38:59.766
- Mom!
- Don't!

39:04.440 --> 39:05.441
I love you.

39:24.560 --> 39:25.607
Cass, what have you done?

39:27.960 --> 39:29.041
What had to be done.

39:32.960 --> 39:37.010
You know, this world,
this sad, doomed little world,

39:38.080 --> 39:39.127
it needs you.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.722
It needs every last Winchester it can get,
and I will not let you die.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.803
I won't let any of you die.

39:50.120 --> 39:54.967
And I won't let you sacrifice yourselves.
You mean too much to me,

39:56.960 --> 39:57.961
to everything.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.161
Yeah, you made a deal.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.641
You made a stupid deal, and I broke it.

40:16.640 --> 40:17.687
You're welcome.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.327
MICK: <i>And just like that,
the Winchesters are back,</i>

40:30.040 --> 40:31.087
<i>for better or worse.</i>

40:31.800 --> 40:33.962
<i>True, they did leave loose ends...</i>

40:37.200 --> 40:38.406
<i>but that's what Mr. Ketch is for.</i>

40:53.880 --> 40:55.564
<i>Every person who knew about Sam and Dean's</i>

40:55.760 --> 40:58.240
<i>little adventure in assassination
has been dealt with.</i>

41:00.360 --> 41:02.647
<i>As far as the world's concerned,
it never even happened.</i>

41:03.560 --> 41:06.564
<i>The last thing we need is for the
United States Government sniffing about,</i>

41:06.720 --> 41:08.006
<i>asking questions.</i>

41:10.400 --> 41:14.371
<i>And as for making inroads with
the American hunters, well, good news.</i>

41:17.240 --> 41:21.450
Let me paint you a picture
of a world without monsters, or demons,

41:22.080 --> 41:24.287
or any of those little buggers
that go bump in the night,

41:25.760 --> 41:28.411
of a world where no one
has to die because of the supernatural,

41:29.560 --> 41:32.086
of a new world, a better world.

41:44.280 --> 41:45.327
I'm listening.
