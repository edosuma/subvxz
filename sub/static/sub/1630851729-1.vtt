WEBVTT

02:05.995 --> 02:08.650
I'’m ready to go

02:10.913 --> 02:13.176
And on the 10

02:34.371 --> 02:38.723
Coachella gold

02:43.728 --> 02:48.342
It'’s almost time

02:50.082 --> 02:55.218
Not to have to wait in line

03:03.095 --> 03:06.186
Where the desert sun

03:13.497 --> 03:17.849
Coachella gold

03:19.373 --> 03:24.291
They might as well be told

03:38.435 --> 03:39.436
Hey, baby.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.314
You ain'’t from around here,
are you?

03:48.184 --> 03:50.621
Mmm, let me guess.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.365
LA.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.063
No?

03:58.803 --> 04:00.370
Mmm, Phoenix.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.285
No?

04:08.291 --> 04:09.553
Am I close?

04:10.467 --> 04:11.816
Don'’t act all silent.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.209
Vegas.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.471
Damn. Vegas.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.387
All right, well...

04:18.475 --> 04:20.216
I'’m off at 1:00
if you wanna get a drink.

04:20.390 --> 04:23.959
Hey, we could use
that bitch over here too, bro.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.614
Fuck off, Bobby.
Let me talk to
my new friend.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.707
Hey, new friend.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.623
Why don'’t you head over there
and meet my boys.

04:35.797 --> 04:38.060
We'’re low on bitches.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.975
Why are you always
fucking starting shit?

04:40.149 --> 04:42.934
Get out of here, Jade.
I don'’t want to talk to you.

04:46.634 --> 04:47.896
So what'’s your deal?

04:51.813 --> 04:53.293
I was just leaving.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.685
Good.

04:56.165 --> 04:57.949
Why don'’t you
get the fuck out of here?

04:58.123 --> 05:00.648
Otherwise you'’re
gonna start having to
pay me fucking double.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.867
Why would I do that?

05:03.041 --> 05:05.217
Because I fucking
run this joint.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.132
Do you know
who the fuck I am?

05:07.916 --> 05:09.744
Bobby?

05:09.918 --> 05:12.486
What'’d you say, you smart-ass?
What'’d you say?

05:25.542 --> 05:27.239
You fuckers done?

05:41.079 --> 05:42.516
Put your hands
on the bar.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.346
Put your hands on the bar.Now.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.956
Now.Hands.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.221
Bobby, you good?He broke my nose.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.875
Get in the car.I want his head.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.051
Get in the car.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.313
You two, out.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.097
Let'’s go. Move it.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.970
You heard him.
Hey, asshole, get outta here.

06:03.493 --> 06:04.799
You got a name?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.239
Wrong answer, stranger.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.880
Hi, Dad.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.579
I don'’t know where you'’re at.

06:46.754 --> 06:49.409
I don'’t know
what the hell you'’re doing.

06:51.454 --> 06:54.239
I don'’t know
who else to call anymore.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.633
I want to get clean again.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.811
Where the fuck are you?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.814
Please call me back.

07:05.555 --> 07:08.428
I'’ll talk to you soon.
Bye. I--

07:09.951 --> 07:11.300
I love you.

07:16.871 --> 07:19.917
I really don'’t appreciate you
manhandling my boy like that.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.530
I take it kind of personally.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.968
So who are you really?

07:28.317 --> 07:31.146
Do we gotta
go through this again?

07:32.408 --> 07:34.671
We don'’t like strangers
in this town.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.761
I think you get that.

07:37.935 --> 07:42.810
What I don'’t get
is what a guy like you
is doing in a place like this.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.421
It'’s a long way from Vegas.

07:48.772 --> 07:52.036
Goddamn it,
I hate this tough guy shit.

07:52.210 --> 07:55.431
Tough guys always think
it'’s best not to talk.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.694
I never understood why.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.391
He doesn'’t look so tough
to me.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.481
He thinks he'’s tough.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.615
I think
they'’ll get you talking.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.270
Sorry. Excuse me.
I gotta get this.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.404
Maggie? Ben, where are you?

08:12.579 --> 08:13.928
I told you
I'’d be home soon.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.407
You don'’t care
that I made you dinner?

08:15.582 --> 08:17.671
Of course I care. Do you want it to get cold?

08:17.845 --> 08:20.325
No, I don'’t want it
to get cold. Okay, I'’ll see you soon.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.153
I'’ll see you soon. Don'’t drive too fast.

08:22.327 --> 08:23.459
I won'’t.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.505
I love you.Okay, bye. Love you too.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.901
My kid sister.
She likes to bake.

08:32.555 --> 08:33.861
I gotta run.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.907
To be continued.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.444
This is all that was
on him, Mr. Nichols.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.803
Give them
a few minutes.

09:07.808 --> 09:11.768
Okay, so next time
you wanna start trouble
in my town,

09:11.942 --> 09:14.249
you might want to think
about taking the next exit.

09:15.946 --> 09:18.819
Whoa, whoa! What the fuck
is going on in here?

09:18.993 --> 09:20.298
Stop it right now.

09:21.473 --> 09:22.953
I am processing him.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.521
What the fuck?

09:25.695 --> 09:27.958
You tell Nichols that
I'’m the sheriff around here,

09:28.132 --> 09:30.221
and you'’re not supposed
to talk to the prisoner.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.006
We'’re not. He'’s fine.For real.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.138
You guys should go.

09:34.312 --> 09:35.749
This isn'’t protocol.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.968
Spare me that shit.
Let me do my job.Hey, hey!

09:40.884 --> 09:44.453
I think
he got the point, okay?
All right.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.195
Nice talking to you, fella.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.905
You good? You'’re okay?

10:02.079 --> 10:04.038
Catch your breath.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.954
I'’m sorry about this.
This isn'’t how
we do things around here.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.392
This goddamn town.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.359
Calm down.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.013
Here'’s what'’s gonna happen.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.711
You'’re gonna
walk me out of here.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.583
Okay?Okay, okay.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.804
You'’re fucking crazy.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.414
Yeah, maybe.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.503
You know who those guys are?I don'’t give a shit.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.028
Look, you'’re a good cop.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.074
Nothing'’s going to happen to you
if you don'’t fuck around.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.728
I'’m just doing my job.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.601
They work for Nichols.
They'’re not cops.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.258
You know
who Nichols is?

10:50.432 --> 10:52.913
Yeah. You wanna tell me
where he lives?

10:53.087 --> 10:54.392
I ain'’t
telling you shit.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.359
He'’s the shogun
around here.

11:05.534 --> 11:06.578
We'’ll see about that.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.176
Hey.Hey.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.746
Smells good.
Yes.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.010
So do you.Thank you.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.969
Where'’s your nephew?

11:49.143 --> 11:51.145
I don'’t know.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.538
And I don'’t know how
he'’s ever gonna take over
the family business.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.846
You know we have
somewhere to be today.I do.

11:57.020 --> 11:58.892
We cannot be late.I will not be late.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.938
Please go talk to your son.That'’s where I'’m going.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.691
Get that goddamn thing
out of your mouth.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.738
Why are you
smoking that shit
all the time?

12:18.912 --> 12:20.914
I'’ve been trying
to call you.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.872
Who is he?Who'’s who?

12:23.046 --> 12:24.265
This guy.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.746
Oh, shit, Dad. Stop. Stop.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.965
How should I know?What did he say?

12:29.139 --> 12:31.315
He didn'’t say shit.Don'’t you lie to me.

12:32.969 --> 12:35.798
Dad, I swear to God
I'’ve never seen this guy
in my fucking life.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.845
Just let him go.
Let me handle him.
I can take him.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.456
Okay, like you
handled him last night?

12:42.936 --> 12:47.375
We save your sorry,
spoiled little ass
month after month.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.421
You bring this shit
to our doorstep.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.163
Like we need this
right now.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.428
Pie is getting cold.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.126
Get up.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.664
How is it?Mmm.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.407
Tasty. Very tasty.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.061
Bobby?

13:23.454 --> 13:26.544
I said, how is it?

13:27.632 --> 13:29.504
It'’s good, Aunt Maggie.
It'’s really good.

13:29.678 --> 13:30.810
Good.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.161
Family is everything,
isn'’t it?

13:34.335 --> 13:35.510
That'’s right.

13:43.387 --> 13:48.262
I want you to tell me
why that man in holding
has this picture.

13:48.436 --> 13:49.785
Look at it.

13:51.482 --> 13:54.485
Yeah, it'’s a real shame.
Isn'’t it, Bobby?

13:54.659 --> 13:56.879
Son, I want you
to think really hard.

13:57.053 --> 14:00.187
I want you to rack
that weed-soaked brain of yours

14:00.361 --> 14:01.623
and tell me.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.236
Who do you think that man
could be?

14:51.673 --> 14:52.979
Oh, man.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.507
Wow.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.163
I'’m lost.

15:04.207 --> 15:05.643
I know.

15:08.603 --> 15:11.127
How did you know
when it was time to quit?

15:21.007 --> 15:22.791
It was ecstasy to me.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.535
And I knew I was--

15:29.232 --> 15:30.668
I was doomed.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.322
So I--

15:32.496 --> 15:34.237
I turned around.

16:18.673 --> 16:21.328
Hunter, you have to come in.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.678
If you can hear me,
this isn'’t the way.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.159
You have to come in.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.553
Bring the car back.
We can talk about this.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.034
I gotta find out
what happened to my daughter.

16:32.208 --> 16:35.472
We can help you.
Just come back in.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.845
There you are.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.326
Hi, Burt.Ben, looking good
as always.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.285
Thank you.Not as good
as your sister.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.156
Maggie.Thank you so much.

17:07.330 --> 17:11.117
Ben, Maggie,
this is Chairman Welmas
of the Cabazon nation.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.293
They own all of this.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.295
Welcome to
Fantasy Springs Resort.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.123
It'’s a pleasure
to meet you, Chairman.

17:17.297 --> 17:20.126
I want you to know
that your interests
are being protected.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.605
Thank you.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.781
And I want to introduce you
to my best friend,

17:23.955 --> 17:25.087
Congressman Mike Ellis.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.741
It'’s a pleasure.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.525
Congressman.Ben here.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.614
My vice president,
my head of security.

17:30.788 --> 17:32.834
Basically the brains
behind my whole operation.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.792
Tell '’em what we got, Ben.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.969
What we'’ve got here
is the biggest aquifer
in the Southwest.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.755
Under all that sand,
just a giant river of water.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.496
That'’s right.

17:42.670 --> 17:45.325
This is what a billion dollars
looks like on a sunny day.

17:45.499 --> 17:48.328
This water deal
is what we'’ve been
waiting for.

17:48.502 --> 17:51.679
We have the tribe on board.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.116
We'’re good to go as soon
as we get state approval.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.987
Oh, you'’ll get
state approval.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.251
We'’ve taken care of that.
It'’s coming in days.

17:58.425 --> 17:59.774
A month from now,

17:59.948 --> 18:01.689
we'’re gonna be back here
popping champagne.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.138
Hey, what'’s going on?

18:16.312 --> 18:18.401
Nothing.Yeah, right.

18:18.575 --> 18:21.100
I know when my brother is fine
and when he'’s not fine.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.711
Plus, that vein in your forehead
is popping out.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.930
So tell me what'’s up.You always take care of me.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.455
You bet your bottom dollar
I do.Yes, you do.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.371
I take care of it all,
don'’t I?Yes, you do.

18:31.545 --> 18:35.201
Listen, if that motherfucker
is in jail and somehow
looking for Melissa,

18:35.375 --> 18:37.377
we'’re gonna take care
of him too.

18:37.551 --> 18:40.249
'’Cause nobody'’s gonna come
between that water deal
and us, okay?

18:40.423 --> 18:42.251
Right?Yes, ma'’am.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.645
I'’ll see you inside.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.311
You are one ballsy fuck,
aren'’t you?

18:59.660 --> 19:00.922
This is my home.

19:01.096 --> 19:03.794
Yeah, I know that.
I'’m here for your son.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.106
Dad, what the fuck
is going on here?

19:11.280 --> 19:12.542
Get back inside now.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.588
Where the fuck
is my daughter?

19:14.762 --> 19:17.112
Who?Melissa.
That'’s her bracelet.

19:17.286 --> 19:20.855
Bobby, get back in the house.We can take this guy.
Fucking shoot him.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.988
Tell me where she is right now,
and I won'’t drop your old man
in front of you.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.817
Get back in the house now.What do you want me to do?

19:26.991 --> 19:28.167
Get back in the house!

19:29.124 --> 19:30.169
Bobby?

19:31.257 --> 19:32.823
I didn'’t--Bobby, shut the fuck up!

19:32.997 --> 19:34.956
Wait. What did you say?

19:37.480 --> 19:40.353
What the fuck
did you just say?I didn'’t want to do any--

19:40.527 --> 19:42.137
Stop talking, Bobby.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.226
We were having fun.Who was having fun?
Say it! Tell me!

19:44.400 --> 19:46.533
You didn'’t mean what?I didn'’t want to hurt her.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.194
I'’m good.

19:55.368 --> 19:56.760
Mmm.Ooh!

19:56.934 --> 19:59.328
I'’m okay.

19:59.502 --> 20:02.897
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is that?
What is it?

20:03.071 --> 20:04.420
This?Yeah, yeah.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.162
Bracelet.Where'’d you get it?

20:09.120 --> 20:10.774
From no one. Do you want it?

20:10.948 --> 20:12.123
Fuck yeah.
Can I have it?

20:12.298 --> 20:14.648
Yeah. It'’s yours
with my blessing.

20:14.822 --> 20:15.779
I love you.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.346
Yeah.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.220
Oh!

20:36.539 --> 20:38.237
She almost spilled my drink!

20:39.455 --> 20:40.978
Where the fuck
have you been?

20:43.416 --> 20:45.853
Jimmy, you found it
and then you broke it?

20:46.027 --> 20:48.812
That'’s what you get, Jimmy!
That'’s what you get!

20:51.989 --> 20:53.382
Wow.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.558
What do I fucking do?Why would you bring that?

20:55.732 --> 20:57.430
That'’s a lot.

20:59.736 --> 21:03.436
You think that shit'’s crazy?
You think that shit'’s crazy?

21:04.437 --> 21:06.395
You should see what I got
in the back.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.550
I didn'’t want to hurt--Bobby!

21:33.683 --> 21:34.989
Bobby!

21:48.611 --> 21:49.786
Bobby?

22:16.378 --> 22:17.727
Is he dead?

22:19.773 --> 22:20.817
Oh, G--

22:30.914 --> 22:33.308
He'’s out there!
Go get that piece of shit!

22:33.482 --> 22:36.093
I want his fucking head!

23:08.648 --> 23:10.650
I see him. I see him.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.262
Go! Go!

23:15.829 --> 23:17.004
He'’s on the move.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.367
Move!

23:32.541 --> 23:34.587
He'’s moving! He'’s moving!

23:38.155 --> 23:39.635
Fire! Fire! Fire!

23:51.517 --> 23:53.649
He'’s off!
He'’s running! He'’s running!

23:53.823 --> 23:54.955
In pursuit.

24:03.267 --> 24:04.878
Move! Move!

24:36.257 --> 24:37.693
Fuck!

24:43.046 --> 24:44.134
Fuck!

25:49.983 --> 25:51.724
I don'’t see
the motherfucker.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.923
Mmm.

26:17.097 --> 26:19.882
Steve said they were
all out of bear claws,
so help yourself.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.318
He stole my keys.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.060
Who?Jake Hunter.

26:24.234 --> 26:25.845
He'’s on his way
to Nichols'’ place.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.415
County. Bartlett, this is Stone.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.201
Get your ass down
to Nichols'’ ranch now.
We have a situation.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.378
And don'’t tell Ms. Sheriff
where you'’re going. Hurry up.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.510
Okay, yeah,
I'’ll be there in five.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.164
I gotta go.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.570
Bartlett, do you copy?

26:55.744 --> 26:57.616
Go for Bartlett.

26:57.790 --> 27:00.923
Hey, looks like this guy
has been making his way
across state. Over.

27:01.097 --> 27:02.446
Fucking give me that.

27:03.273 --> 27:05.232
This is Stone.

27:05.406 --> 27:08.365
Officer Kim,
as opposed to fucking around
and playing private detective,

27:08.539 --> 27:09.758
why don'’t you go write
some parking tickets?

27:09.932 --> 27:11.847
Okay? Copy that?

27:12.021 --> 27:13.196
This is under control.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.157
They got him.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.252
He'’s around here somewhere,
I know it.

27:25.426 --> 27:27.558
He won'’t last long
out here.

27:27.733 --> 27:31.562
And if you get him
in your sights, you kill him.
You understand me?

27:33.390 --> 27:36.176
I ain'’t never
killed anybody before.It'’s never too late to learn.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.798
Brock. Brock.

27:53.976 --> 27:54.890
Jesus Christ.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.287
I didn'’t sign up
for this, Stone.

28:00.461 --> 28:02.245
Where are you going?To the station.

28:02.419 --> 28:04.247
You'’re not
going anywhere.

28:04.421 --> 28:06.380
This is out of
my jurisdiction, man.Goddamn it, stay here!

28:06.554 --> 28:09.426
No, good luck, man.Don'’t be a pussy!
Get back here!

28:22.657 --> 28:24.877
Stone, come in.
This is Sarge One.

28:25.051 --> 28:26.922
He'’s not around here.
We don'’t know where he'’s at.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.665
What do you have for me?

28:30.839 --> 28:34.060
I think we lost
this motherfucker. Meet me at the tree line.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.584
We need to send a drone up.

29:01.304 --> 29:04.917
No! Don'’t fucking kill me.
Don'’t fucking kill me.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.745
Oh, God. Oh, God.

29:06.919 --> 29:09.356
Tell me a reason
not to put one
in your head right now.

29:09.530 --> 29:12.402
Just a fucking cop.
Fuck, that hurts.
Please stop that.

29:12.576 --> 29:15.536
You work with Kim?Yes, yes. She'’s my partner.

29:15.710 --> 29:18.408
I don'’t believe you.I'’m not a dirty cop.
I swear, man.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.236
Nichols owns the town,
but he doesn'’t own me.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.325
I'’m just a fucking cop,
okay?

29:23.718 --> 29:25.285
That'’s why I was leaving.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.504
Please don'’t kill me, man.
I got a kid.

29:27.678 --> 29:31.900
Okay, you go back to Kim.
You tell her I'’m out here.
No one else.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.510
I-I won'’t say anything.

29:33.684 --> 29:36.296
I'’ll come find you.Okay, okay. I swear to God.

29:36.470 --> 29:37.776
Okay.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.309
Fuck.

29:50.484 --> 29:52.399
Gotta get the fuck
outta here.

29:56.490 --> 29:59.841
t]

30:06.021 --> 30:07.370
Fuck, we lost him.

30:07.544 --> 30:08.981
Handle this motherfucker.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.810
Don'’t worry about it.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.463
We got an eye on him.

31:02.295 --> 31:03.644
Fuck!

31:05.733 --> 31:07.866
Fuck.

31:33.108 --> 31:35.458
Are you hurt?
What happened?
What'’s going on?

31:35.632 --> 31:36.764
I'’m fine, okay.

31:36.938 --> 31:39.114
Nichols'’ ranch. Shit went bad.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.160
He killed Bobby.Oh, my God.

31:41.334 --> 31:43.989
He could'’ve fucking killed me.
He let me go.

31:45.860 --> 31:48.689
He has a message for you.
He wants you to know
where he'’s at.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.486
We lost him.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.575
It'’s just too dark out there.
We can'’t see shit.

32:05.749 --> 32:08.143
I know, I know.We'’ll have to resume
the search tomorrow.

32:08.317 --> 32:10.102
Just keep a perimeter.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.669
Just two ways
out of these fields.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.193
Okay.

32:18.719 --> 32:21.200
So I was just telling her.

32:21.374 --> 32:24.290
You need anything--
anything-- I'’m here.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.248
We'’re family.

32:26.422 --> 32:29.817
But I hate to say this.
This can'’t get out.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.427
It won'’t.It can'’t.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.299
I know.

32:33.473 --> 32:36.432
I mean, I need to know
from both of you,
friend to friend,

32:36.606 --> 32:38.521
is there anything else
you'’re not telling me?

32:38.695 --> 32:41.437
Anything I need to know?No, Vic.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.745
This is my business here.
It'’s on the line.

32:44.919 --> 32:47.617
We'’re days away
from the state funding.We know that, Vic.

32:47.791 --> 32:50.577
If you know that,
and you two want your piece,

32:50.751 --> 32:52.883
you better
clean this shit up.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.060
I mean fucking clean.

32:55.234 --> 32:57.105
'’Cause kid or no kid,

32:57.279 --> 32:59.760
nothing'’s getting in the way
of me making
half a billion dollars.

32:59.934 --> 33:02.502
Nothing and nobody.
You understand?

33:03.198 --> 33:04.765
You understand?

33:06.288 --> 33:07.681
Christ.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.557
I'’m sorry.

33:14.731 --> 33:17.996
I'’m sorry about Bobby.
I'’m sorry about what happened.

33:21.216 --> 33:22.652
Fuck.

33:42.542 --> 33:43.934
He told you that?

33:44.587 --> 33:45.762
Yeah.

33:45.936 --> 33:47.199
Why me?

33:48.330 --> 33:50.028
I don'’t know.

33:50.202 --> 33:51.812
We need to call in
the other counties.

33:51.986 --> 33:54.771
This is huge.
This is completely insane.

33:54.945 --> 33:57.078
Yeah, but then Nichols
will hunt us down too.

33:57.252 --> 34:00.299
Yeah, so what
are we gonna do?Keep digging.

34:00.473 --> 34:01.952
I'’ll head out there
in the morning.

34:08.220 --> 34:10.048
Kim, what if
he'’s playing you?

34:10.222 --> 34:12.746
None of this makes sense.
Why would he let you go?

34:12.920 --> 34:15.270
I don'’t know.And why would he
let me go?

34:15.444 --> 34:18.534
He said he was looking
for his daughter.

34:18.708 --> 34:22.451
Yeah, well, I have a feeling
Bobby Nichols knows
what happened to her.

34:34.463 --> 34:36.770
She'’s haunting us, Mags.

34:37.640 --> 34:40.121
That girl
wants her revenge.

34:41.514 --> 34:44.038
No one'’s gonna
do nothing, okay?

34:47.389 --> 34:50.479
We do what we do
for family.

34:50.653 --> 34:54.309
That man'’s gonna die
and no one'’s gonna
know the difference.

34:56.181 --> 35:00.185
We built this business
from the ground up,

35:00.359 --> 35:02.970
and I will protect that
at all costs.

35:05.059 --> 35:07.017
Bobby was a fuckup
and you know it.

35:08.323 --> 35:09.672
Look at this place,
man.

35:09.846 --> 35:11.587
Do you think
that he could have
handled this?

35:11.761 --> 35:13.720
No. Why?

35:13.894 --> 35:16.375
'’Cause it was always
gonna be me and you.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.214
Come here.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.825
Did you fail?

36:16.565 --> 36:18.219
Yeah, did I fail you?

36:19.002 --> 36:21.309
No, you didn'’t fail me.

36:21.483 --> 36:24.747
I don'’t doubt
the job I'’m doing.

36:25.574 --> 36:28.186
I doubt my ability
to do it.

36:30.971 --> 36:34.192
I'’d prefer to be at home
with Melissa.

36:36.585 --> 36:38.065
She misses you.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.067
I don'’t have the answers
that you have.

36:40.241 --> 36:43.984
I don'’t have answers.
I'’m just comfortable
with the question.

36:48.249 --> 36:51.339
The home
I have with my family,
I destroyed.

36:54.777 --> 37:00.522
There'’s just so many times
you can take something precious
like that away

37:01.871 --> 37:05.223
before it cripples you.

38:11.854 --> 38:13.508
How long
you been smoking?

38:18.121 --> 38:19.732
None of your business.

38:20.646 --> 38:22.561
I mean,
I don'’t remember.

38:23.475 --> 38:25.477
You don'’t need
to take care of me.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.435
I can go with Mom.

38:27.609 --> 38:28.915
Mom'’s not better.

38:29.742 --> 38:31.221
And you are?

38:31.700 --> 38:33.136
I'’m here.

38:34.007 --> 38:36.226
Are you though?

38:36.401 --> 38:39.534
You come back after being gone
from who-the-fuck-knows-where.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.623
And then you'’re my dad
all over again?

38:43.016 --> 38:44.496
That'’s not fair.

38:44.670 --> 38:49.762
I'’m 18, I have my own life,
my own shit going on.

38:49.936 --> 38:52.895
You know, like,
you don'’t want to
deal with that.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.810
I wanna hear it.No, you don'’t.

38:54.984 --> 38:57.247
I don'’t need some in-and-out dad
telling me how to live my life

38:57.422 --> 38:59.249
when he can barely
live his own.

38:59.424 --> 39:03.166
Are you gonna take those
shades off and actually
look me in the eye?

39:09.782 --> 39:11.392
You gonna tell me
what happened?

39:12.959 --> 39:14.134
You know I can'’t.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.531
Well, then guess what.
I'’m not gonna tell you
where I'’ve been.

39:21.228 --> 39:22.795
How'’s that?

39:22.969 --> 39:24.623
That'’s not right.
I'’m your father.

39:27.843 --> 39:30.455
I don'’t need a father.
I need a dad.

40:17.371 --> 40:19.199
Okay, let'’s try it.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.431
Stand by. We'’ve reached
the property and dropping off
the asset now.

40:55.365 --> 40:57.672
Sir. Sir.

40:57.846 --> 41:00.153
Sir, I'’m here to escort you
to the property.
Right this way.

41:00.327 --> 41:01.502
Follow me.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.958
May I help you?Yes, I hope so.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.570
I'’m looking for Ben Nichols.Okay, and?

41:25.744 --> 41:30.139
And you are baking
something fantastic.

41:30.313 --> 41:33.316
Is there something you need?That smells good.
Can I come in?

41:33.491 --> 41:35.667
We have a lot going on.

41:35.841 --> 41:40.672
A really full day.
We need to take care of
some things.

41:40.846 --> 41:43.544
Yeah, I think I can help you
with your present situation.

41:43.718 --> 41:45.981
Oh, really.
What situation is that?

41:46.155 --> 41:48.201
The man out in the field.

41:48.375 --> 41:50.333
I'’m the only one who'’s gonna
be able to bring him in.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.249
So why don'’t you
call your brother, Ben,

41:53.423 --> 41:57.602
and we'’ll have some muffins
and a little chat.

41:57.776 --> 41:58.994
Okay?

42:01.214 --> 42:03.695
Smells fantastique.

42:39.034 --> 42:41.994
We can get you clean.
You just gotta trust this guy.

42:42.168 --> 42:44.039
Trust. Right.

42:44.213 --> 42:47.129
Like you-- Can you--

42:47.303 --> 42:50.132
Can you just take me home?You can'’t keep going
like this.

42:50.306 --> 42:52.787
I just need some sleep.Listen, we can get you clean.

42:52.961 --> 42:55.094
We'’ll do it together.
It'’s gonna be hell,
but we'’ll do it together.

42:55.268 --> 42:56.835
You won'’t be alone.Okay.

42:57.009 --> 42:59.794
We can do this.Take me home, okay?
Please.

43:09.151 --> 43:10.196
Brother.

43:11.371 --> 43:12.415
Hey, Jake.

43:13.329 --> 43:15.941
God Almighty.

43:16.115 --> 43:17.856
Hey. Hey, man.

43:18.030 --> 43:20.206
Thank you for doing this.How are you?

43:20.380 --> 43:23.426
Well, what'’s on your mind?

43:23.601 --> 43:25.907
What the hell'’s going on?You remember Melissa,
right?

43:26.081 --> 43:27.256
I see.

43:27.430 --> 43:28.867
She grew up a little bit.Yeah, she did.

43:29.041 --> 43:31.347
Hey.Hey.

43:31.521 --> 43:32.827
You probably don'’t
remember me, do you?

43:33.001 --> 43:34.786
Nope.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.484
You were a little tiny thing
last time I saw you.

43:37.658 --> 43:40.835
She'’s sick now.
We gotta get her in somewhere,
and I only trust you.

43:42.010 --> 43:44.404
I can'’t handle it, man.
This was your world.

43:44.578 --> 43:46.754
Yeah, yeah, sure was.

43:48.190 --> 43:49.627
Um...

43:49.801 --> 43:52.412
Can you do this for me?
It'’s out of my realm.

43:52.586 --> 43:55.807
There'’s not too many things
in this life you could ask
that I wouldn'’t do for you.

43:55.981 --> 43:57.722
I know.

43:57.896 --> 44:00.550
She needs it.
She doesn'’t trust me.

44:00.725 --> 44:03.728
Get her in somewhere?
What'’s going on?I'’m right here.

44:04.380 --> 44:05.817
Literally right here.

44:05.991 --> 44:08.210
I know.
And you trust him like me.
More than me.

44:08.384 --> 44:10.038
I don'’t know him.He'’s been through this.

44:10.212 --> 44:13.520
Your dad and I
been doing things
before you were even born.

44:13.694 --> 44:16.871
Listen to what he'’s telling you.
He'’s been clean,
what, 30 years now?

44:17.567 --> 44:19.047
At least, yeah.

44:19.221 --> 44:20.919
And he'’s helped people
get clean. I trust him.

44:21.093 --> 44:23.051
Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it.

44:23.225 --> 44:26.315
For what it'’s worth,
I know where you'’re at,
just looking at you.

44:27.926 --> 44:30.276
And I'’ve been there before
myself.

44:30.450 --> 44:34.454
Uh, this ain'’t no intervention
or any of that stuff.

44:34.628 --> 44:37.457
'’Cause I don'’t
even believe in that,
all right?

44:37.631 --> 44:41.330
God bless the people
that it helped,
but it didn'’t work for me.

44:41.504 --> 44:44.464
And that ain'’t what I'’m gonna--
that ain'’t what
I'’m thinking of doing.

44:44.638 --> 44:47.119
Melissa, take the glasses off.
We'’re trying to help you.

44:49.774 --> 44:52.167
Well, there you are.

44:52.341 --> 44:55.693
Okay, you guys are good, right?
I'’ll get going.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.961
Whatever. He can leave.
He does it all the time.

45:29.552 --> 45:32.294
Well, first, my condolences.

45:33.556 --> 45:37.386
There'’s nothing worse
than a parent losing a child.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.998
How did you even know
about that?

45:40.172 --> 45:43.784
let'’s cut to the chase.

45:43.958 --> 45:47.527
Um, I don'’t think
you have any idea

45:47.701 --> 45:50.530
who you'’ve got
in that field out there.

45:50.704 --> 45:52.532
Well, we can take care
of our own.

45:57.580 --> 46:00.888
I know your security firm
very well.

46:01.062 --> 46:02.803
Okay.

46:02.977 --> 46:07.155
I know you'’re aligned
with some really deep,
deep pockets.

46:07.329 --> 46:11.899
And you'’re in charge
of the security arrangements

46:12.073 --> 46:15.120
for some pretty
important corporations.

46:16.556 --> 46:19.254
Am I right? Right?Yeah. Yeah.

46:19.428 --> 46:23.868
Well-- Well, your interests
are going to crumble

46:24.042 --> 46:29.047
if you let Jake carry this
to its inescapable conclusion.

46:34.008 --> 46:35.444
He'’s not gonna stop.

46:37.011 --> 46:39.797
He'’s not gonna stop
until you'’re dead.

46:40.623 --> 46:42.712
Or he is.

46:42.887 --> 46:44.236
Hmm.

46:46.107 --> 46:47.282
He'’s dead.

46:54.899 --> 46:59.207
You know,
you and I both know...

47:00.643 --> 47:03.777
we don'’t have
the security clearances
that we used to.

47:06.258 --> 47:11.089
But his level of employment
has not changed.

47:15.528 --> 47:16.529
Hmm.

47:16.703 --> 47:18.836
You got any questions
for me?

47:19.010 --> 47:21.012
Not just now,
thank you very much.

47:21.186 --> 47:23.492
Appreciate the information.You'’re welcome.

47:23.666 --> 47:25.103
Enjoy your muffin.

48:04.229 --> 48:05.491
Wake the fuck up!

48:17.068 --> 48:19.287
You piece of shit.

48:19.461 --> 48:21.811
We found you
like the rat that you are.

48:21.986 --> 48:24.640
Sneaking around
and stabbing guys in the back
like a pussy.

48:24.814 --> 48:26.773
Don'’t tickle him.
Make it hurt.

48:26.947 --> 48:29.950
I oughta
blow your fucking head off,
but it'’ll go too fast.

48:45.835 --> 48:47.359
You fucking dirty bastard.

48:47.533 --> 48:48.534
You fucking--

48:48.708 --> 48:50.101
I'’m gonna kill you.

48:57.238 --> 48:59.197
Stone, you copy?

49:04.854 --> 49:06.552
Call them off.

49:06.726 --> 49:08.902
That'’s not how we do things
around here, Deputy Director.

49:09.076 --> 49:10.773
Michaels. Michaels.

49:12.210 --> 49:14.125
Bring them in.Bring them in?

49:14.299 --> 49:16.344
That guy deserves
a fucking bullet
in his fucking head.

49:16.518 --> 49:18.172
No one'’s bringing him in.Mags.

49:18.346 --> 49:21.132
I'’m sick of sitting around
having a civilized conversation.

49:21.306 --> 49:22.916
Either you kill him,
or we'’re killing him.

49:23.090 --> 49:25.136
How is that working out
for you?

49:37.017 --> 49:39.193
Bartlett, on my way.

49:39.367 --> 49:41.152
I'’ll text you when I get there.

50:01.868 --> 50:03.435
Slow down.

50:07.395 --> 50:08.657
Slow movements, Hunter.

50:10.703 --> 50:12.487
You gave my partner
coordinates.

50:13.184 --> 50:15.142
Here I am. Why?

50:16.752 --> 50:19.320
Stop. This distance is good.

50:19.494 --> 50:22.106
If I wanted to kill you,
I would'’ve done it
back at the station.

50:22.671 --> 50:23.933
So then what?

50:24.108 --> 50:25.805
You'’re supposed to be
a good cop, right?

50:26.980 --> 50:29.069
Yeah, I am.

50:29.243 --> 50:32.942
Well, these fucks know
what happened to my daughter.
Help me take '’em down.

50:34.335 --> 50:35.728
Nichols.Yeah.

50:37.556 --> 50:39.601
So do you think
they had something
to do with it?

50:39.775 --> 50:42.169
His crew runs the whole town.
They'’re covering up some shit.

50:42.343 --> 50:44.693
Think about it.
You know it'’s true.

50:50.699 --> 50:52.745
You'’re hurt.
Let me help you.

50:53.485 --> 50:54.660
I'’ll live.

50:54.834 --> 50:56.444
Her name is Melissa.

50:56.618 --> 50:58.185
Check
your missing persons.

51:02.537 --> 51:05.975
How will I get ahold of you?I'’ll find you.

51:40.793 --> 51:43.665
Hunter, let me go.

51:45.276 --> 51:46.973
You fucking motherfucker!

51:48.105 --> 51:49.802
I'’ll kill you!

51:51.020 --> 51:53.632
Bobby.What about Bobby?

51:53.806 --> 51:56.243
Nichols'’ piece-of-shit kid.
You hang out with him.

51:56.417 --> 51:59.333
He'’s a nut.
He picks up broads,
he gets '’em high.

51:59.507 --> 52:01.640
That'’s what they want to do.You know these girls?

52:01.814 --> 52:03.729
They'’re junkies.
They'’re pieces of trash.

52:03.903 --> 52:08.125
You fucking motherfucker!
I'’m gonna kill you
if I get out of this!

52:08.299 --> 52:10.127
Nineteen years old, brunette.

52:10.823 --> 52:11.867
Melissa.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.436
He said he loved her.

52:15.610 --> 52:17.046
Melissa.
You fucking know
who it was.

52:17.221 --> 52:18.657
She was a junkie.

52:20.833 --> 52:23.923
I didn'’t kill her!
Nichols killed her!
I didn'’t do shit!

52:26.099 --> 52:28.145
How you doing?

52:28.319 --> 52:30.147
Hey.

52:30.321 --> 52:32.149
This is the fucking
Manson Family.

52:41.158 --> 52:43.682
What'’s going on in here?Hey, how you doing?

52:57.913 --> 52:59.306
Where'’s Bobby?

53:02.222 --> 53:03.789
Putting on a clinic.

53:03.963 --> 53:05.791
Get everyone outta here.Shut the fuck up.

53:05.965 --> 53:07.880
Get everyone outta here!

53:08.054 --> 53:08.881
All right, guys, that'’s it.
It'’s a wrap. Let'’s go.

53:09.055 --> 53:11.013
Hey, Bobby.Everybody out!

53:11.188 --> 53:12.711
Get off, man.
Show some manners.

53:13.581 --> 53:15.496
Get off!Fuck you!

53:15.670 --> 53:16.802
Get outta here.

53:16.976 --> 53:18.456
You fucking--I don'’t give shit.

53:18.630 --> 53:21.154
She'’s in there with me.I don'’t give a shit.

53:21.328 --> 53:23.287
Get the fuck out.You heard him, Bobby.
Let'’s go.

53:23.461 --> 53:26.899
Fuck you! Fuck you!Everybody out!

53:27.073 --> 53:28.640
Everybody! All y'’all!

53:31.033 --> 53:34.211
I didn'’t fucking do shit.
It was Nichols who killed her.

53:38.171 --> 53:40.608
You'’re fucking lying,
you cocksucker.

53:40.782 --> 53:43.611
She'’s fucking dead!
And I didn'’t do it!

54:10.769 --> 54:13.424
I didn'’t do it.
You gotta let me go, man.

54:18.994 --> 54:20.474
Let me go.

55:27.019 --> 55:28.673
Mr. Greenberg.Great to see you.

55:30.196 --> 55:32.067
I can keep this
as tight as you like.

55:32.241 --> 55:34.243
I know. What happens next?

55:34.896 --> 55:36.594
Not sure.

55:36.768 --> 55:38.291
I haven'’t decided yet.

55:39.771 --> 55:42.643
But I like to leave
those kinds of things
to chance.

55:42.817 --> 55:45.124
I like chance.
Favors the prepared.

55:46.081 --> 55:48.388
You know, I warned them.

55:48.562 --> 55:52.958
I told them nothing
was gonna get in the way
of this water deal.

55:53.132 --> 55:57.092
What about your guy,
this, uh-- this Hunter?

55:57.266 --> 56:00.357
Hunter'’s my guy.
I'’ll take care of him.
Don'’t worry.

56:00.531 --> 56:03.316
Nothing'’s gonna get
on your skirt, okay?

56:03.490 --> 56:05.057
All right.

56:05.231 --> 56:07.146
Give my regards
to the tribe.

56:07.755 --> 56:08.887
Thanks.

56:16.024 --> 56:18.375
Are you okay?Yeah, I'’m good.

56:18.549 --> 56:20.377
Oh. I'’m Deputy Kim.

56:21.639 --> 56:23.771
This is the guy
they sent in.Oh.

56:24.990 --> 56:28.123
Who are you with again?I used to be Jake'’s boss.

56:28.820 --> 56:29.908
Oh.

56:31.388 --> 56:35.043
So, uh, you got anything
you could share with me?

56:35.217 --> 56:37.394
Nothing. I had to go
check on my daughter.

56:37.568 --> 56:38.830
Ah.

56:39.004 --> 56:40.353
Daughters are good.

56:44.705 --> 56:48.535
I did call your cell phone,
and there was no answer.

56:48.709 --> 56:50.232
Shit.

56:50.407 --> 56:51.886
I must'’ve
left it at home.

56:52.931 --> 56:54.846
I hate when that happens.

56:55.020 --> 57:00.155
So, does Jake have a sister,
a female family member
he'’s close to?

57:00.329 --> 57:05.073
Well, we do know
that he'’s tried to reach
some members of his family,

57:05.247 --> 57:06.858
and we'’re not
quite sure who.

57:07.032 --> 57:11.863
And he did leave a text message
for his ex-wife. Why?

57:12.037 --> 57:15.083
There may be a lead
I need to follow up on.

57:15.257 --> 57:16.781
It could give us
some more answers.

57:16.955 --> 57:18.826
How many people
know about it?

57:19.000 --> 57:20.437
No one.Great.

57:21.133 --> 57:22.700
Let'’s keep it that way.

57:25.703 --> 57:29.097
Were you gonna tell me
about this lead? I was going to.

57:34.973 --> 57:37.149
Bill, where'’s Melissa?Oh. Hey.

57:38.237 --> 57:40.848
Listen, I--
I knew you were gonna show up.

57:41.022 --> 57:43.547
I can'’t get her on the phone.
Her mother'’s not picking up.

57:43.721 --> 57:47.159
I didn'’t call you
because I figured
she was coming back.

57:47.333 --> 57:50.118
What do you mean?
I left her with you. I thought
you had your eyes on her.

57:50.292 --> 57:54.688
Yeah, you sure did leave her
with me. You left me
with a big, heavy load.

57:54.862 --> 57:58.170
I tried to help you out,
but I ain'’t
no fucking babysitter.

57:58.344 --> 58:00.651
And that'’s what
it was turning into.

58:00.825 --> 58:02.740
You need a dose of reality.

58:02.914 --> 58:05.743
You'’re running around
being a superhero.

58:05.917 --> 58:08.528
Big shot. Yeah.
And you'’re good at it.

58:09.529 --> 58:11.792
But where were you
when she needed you?

58:13.925 --> 58:16.884
I should have told you,
but I didn'’t want to
make it worse, so--

58:17.058 --> 58:18.799
I know where she is.

58:18.973 --> 58:20.409
Where?

58:23.108 --> 58:25.153
Ever hear of a place
called the Salton Sea?

58:25.327 --> 58:27.939
Yeah, I know it.
What the fuck
is she doing out there?

58:28.113 --> 58:30.550
She'’s with some drunken asshole
named Bobby.

58:31.420 --> 58:33.814
Some fucking piece of shit.

58:33.988 --> 58:35.990
And God knows what
they'’re doing over there.

58:37.122 --> 58:38.210
I gotta go find her,
man.

58:38.384 --> 58:40.647
She was trying.

58:50.178 --> 58:53.007
So, how many points of entry
are there into this area?

58:53.181 --> 58:56.141
It'’s about five square miles
of connected fields.

58:56.315 --> 58:58.578
And exits?

58:58.752 --> 59:02.060
No, it'’s pretty contained.
All farmland. Only a couple
access roads in and out.

59:03.844 --> 59:06.804
Well, then
he'’s there for a reason,

59:06.978 --> 59:09.937
and he'’s not
looking to escape.

59:10.111 --> 59:13.419
Uh, me and Bartlett
are gonna follow up
on something.

59:15.160 --> 59:17.597
This is Deputy Kim.
This is a restricted channel.

59:18.642 --> 59:20.121
They'’re all dead.

59:21.949 --> 59:25.387
Jake, son,
you gotta come in.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.433
That'’s not gonna happen.

59:27.607 --> 59:28.869
What do you want?

59:30.305 --> 59:31.350
Answers.

59:33.134 --> 59:35.789
What are you gonna do,
son?

59:35.963 --> 59:37.791
Wipe out the whole town?

59:37.965 --> 59:40.402
No, just them.Who'’s them?

59:41.316 --> 59:42.970
Ask Sheriff Kim.

59:44.406 --> 59:47.192
Jake, you'’re hurt.

59:47.366 --> 59:49.020
You gotta come in.

59:49.194 --> 59:51.936
Don'’t make me
call in the team.

59:52.676 --> 59:53.633
Don'’t do that.

59:53.807 --> 59:55.374
You do what you gotta do.

59:56.810 --> 59:59.596
Murph, you know
who I'’m here for.

59:59.770 --> 1:00:01.249
You'’re gonna wanna know.

1:00:02.816 --> 1:00:04.252
It'’s Melissa.

1:00:20.355 --> 1:00:21.443
Okay.

1:00:22.357 --> 1:00:23.620
They have Melissa.

1:00:24.925 --> 1:00:26.100
They killed her.

1:00:27.580 --> 1:00:29.190
I'’m coming back
for all of them.

1:00:30.278 --> 1:00:32.150
You'’re gonna help me
take them down.

1:00:36.415 --> 1:00:37.808
He'’s coming in.

1:00:39.679 --> 1:00:40.854
What?

1:00:41.812 --> 1:00:43.683
He'’s bringing the fight
to us.

1:00:47.426 --> 1:00:48.601
Gear up.

1:00:50.168 --> 1:00:54.215
And under no circumstances
do you shoot him.

1:01:09.448 --> 1:01:11.276
Amigo!

1:01:11.450 --> 1:01:12.799
Keys!

1:01:14.409 --> 1:01:15.846
Don'’t kill me.
Don'’t kill me.

1:01:16.020 --> 1:01:17.499
Over there! Move!

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:20.894
Whatever you want!
Just don'’t kill me.

1:01:25.899 --> 1:01:30.121
Not my fuckin'’ truck,
asshole!

1:01:33.037 --> 1:01:34.255
What is it?

1:01:34.429 --> 1:01:36.301
This town is plagued
with missing girls.

1:01:36.475 --> 1:01:38.564
You think Jake Hunter
knows something about this?

1:01:38.738 --> 1:01:42.133
Yeah, I do.
I think that'’s why he'’s here.

1:01:42.307 --> 1:01:44.526
And I think his daughter'’s photo
is going up next.

1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:30.850
White van.
Suspects are considered...

1:03:31.024 --> 1:03:33.157
Be advised,
suspect is armed.

1:03:36.464 --> 1:03:37.857
Copy, westbound headed...

1:04:29.561 --> 1:04:30.997
Taking the shot!

1:04:35.045 --> 1:04:37.221
I told you no shooting,
goddamn it.

1:05:48.205 --> 1:05:50.033
We have to move. Now.

1:05:50.207 --> 1:05:52.078
You two bring the car
around right now.You got it.

1:05:52.252 --> 1:05:53.775
Go!Okay. You drive.

1:05:55.255 --> 1:05:56.517
Goddamn it!

1:06:25.242 --> 1:06:26.373
Three forward!

1:06:26.547 --> 1:06:28.680
Two left, three right.

1:07:31.438 --> 1:07:33.614
Okay, so--Sh, shh.

1:07:33.788 --> 1:07:36.617
We'’re in full pursuit.
He'’s heading into
an abandoned church.

1:07:36.791 --> 1:07:39.272
That'’s it. Let'’s go.
Head to the church.

1:08:26.667 --> 1:08:29.322
Where are we going?
I don'’t think
this is a good idea.

1:08:29.496 --> 1:08:31.542
Stop the car.
Stop the fucking car!

1:08:33.326 --> 1:08:34.849
Shit.

1:08:47.819 --> 1:08:49.386
Take me to Nichols.Okay.

1:09:02.834 --> 1:09:04.749
How did we get here, Mags?

1:09:05.750 --> 1:09:07.578
We had it so perfect.

1:09:09.275 --> 1:09:12.844
There'’s no such thing
as perfect.
There'’s just us.

1:09:17.065 --> 1:09:18.371
She'’s out here.

1:09:20.156 --> 1:09:21.809
I can feel her.

1:09:21.983 --> 1:09:25.161
No, she is not out here, okay?
Let'’s go back home. Come on.

1:09:28.990 --> 1:09:30.514
Okay, I'’m headed back.

1:10:22.653 --> 1:10:24.089
Lose the gun.

1:10:33.925 --> 1:10:35.143
Sit down.

1:10:37.885 --> 1:10:39.583
It'’s gonna be okay.

1:10:39.757 --> 1:10:41.541
No, it isn'’t
gonna be okay.

1:10:42.847 --> 1:10:44.675
What do you want?

1:10:44.849 --> 1:10:47.895
I want to hear it
from your mouth
what happened to my daughter.

1:10:48.069 --> 1:10:49.680
I don'’t know
who your daughter is.

1:10:53.466 --> 1:10:54.859
I'’ll break
every one of them.

1:10:55.033 --> 1:10:56.730
You'’re a dead man.

1:10:56.904 --> 1:10:59.080
Do you know
about Bobby and Melissa?

1:10:59.255 --> 1:11:01.169
Do you know about
the drugs he gave her?

1:11:01.344 --> 1:11:03.998
Do you know
that he raped her?I had no idea.

1:11:05.261 --> 1:11:07.567
Okay! Fuck! Stop!

1:11:09.439 --> 1:11:10.788
All I know--

1:11:12.398 --> 1:11:14.487
All I know is
she was causing problems.

1:11:14.661 --> 1:11:17.316
So now you know who she is.

1:11:17.490 --> 1:11:22.060
I want to hear
how she ended up OD'’d and raped
in this shithole town.

1:11:22.234 --> 1:11:24.889
Bobby told me
that it was an accident.

1:11:25.063 --> 1:11:28.501
My son had a drug problem.
Your daughter was an addict too.

1:11:28.675 --> 1:11:31.765
And these kids
were partying
and it went too far.

1:11:31.939 --> 1:11:33.289
My daughter is gone.

1:11:33.463 --> 1:11:35.029
So is my son.

1:11:35.856 --> 1:11:38.381
No one
killed your daughter.

1:11:38.555 --> 1:11:40.992
It was drugs. She OD'’d.

1:11:41.166 --> 1:11:42.950
That'’s fucking bullshit.
That'’s not how it happened.

1:11:43.124 --> 1:11:44.952
It is how it happened!

1:11:46.737 --> 1:11:49.130
Yeah, go ahead.
Fucking do it.

1:11:49.914 --> 1:11:51.132
Go ahead. Do it.

1:11:53.047 --> 1:11:56.834
You will never know
where her body is,
and you'’ll never find her.

1:11:57.008 --> 1:11:58.749
That'’s gonna hold up in court.

1:11:58.923 --> 1:12:01.969
Deputy Bartlett
requesting immediate backup
to Nichols Ranch.

1:12:02.143 --> 1:12:04.015
Immediate backup
to Nichols Ranch.

1:12:12.893 --> 1:12:15.722
Come out
with your hands up, now.

1:12:17.289 --> 1:12:20.423
You let us walk out of here.
That'’s the only chance you have.

1:12:24.427 --> 1:12:26.211
Fuck. Get the fuck up.

1:12:26.385 --> 1:12:28.779
Let'’s go. Get the fuck up.

1:12:31.085 --> 1:12:33.218
Okay!

1:12:33.392 --> 1:12:35.220
Jake, don'’t hurt '’em.
Don'’t hurt '’em.
Just bring '’em out.

1:12:35.394 --> 1:12:37.483
Come on.
Move, you motherfuckers.

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:39.964
Bring '’em down.

1:12:42.967 --> 1:12:44.229
All right, you fucker!

1:12:44.403 --> 1:12:46.144
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1:12:47.101 --> 1:12:49.408
Jake, put the gun down.

1:12:49.582 --> 1:12:52.368
Put the gun down.Put your gun down, please!

1:12:52.542 --> 1:12:53.978
Put the gun down!

1:12:54.152 --> 1:12:56.937
Nichols, put it down.

1:12:57.111 --> 1:13:00.071
Do you know
what they did to Melissa?Don'’t get hurt. Put it down.

1:13:00.245 --> 1:13:02.334
Do you know what they did
to my little girl?

1:13:02.508 --> 1:13:04.510
Holy shit. She'’s still
fucking breathing, Dad.

1:13:04.684 --> 1:13:06.469
We gotta
fucking do something.It'’s too late.

1:13:06.643 --> 1:13:08.558
Too late?
She'’s fucking alive!

1:13:08.732 --> 1:13:10.603
She'’s halfway dead.Halfway dead, my ass.

1:13:10.777 --> 1:13:13.084
Are you shitting me?
What do you want to do?
What'’s the game plan?

1:13:13.258 --> 1:13:15.956
I want you to be quiet so
I can think for one minute.
Can you do that?

1:13:16.130 --> 1:13:19.525
This isn'’t my fucking fault.She'’s dead because of you,
asshole!

1:13:19.699 --> 1:13:21.658
Oh, my God.You sick-- She'’s alive!

1:13:21.832 --> 1:13:23.703
Let me tell you right now,
you fucking asshole!

1:13:23.877 --> 1:13:26.445
Look at her!Can you take it down?

1:13:26.619 --> 1:13:28.534
You killed her,
you motherfucker.

1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:37.717
Did you fucking see that?All right, take him home.

1:13:37.891 --> 1:13:39.763
Dad,
I'’m fucking sorry, okay?Shut up!

1:13:39.937 --> 1:13:40.981
Dad, I-- Fucking--

1:13:41.155 --> 1:13:43.244
Just go home, kid.

1:13:49.337 --> 1:13:50.817
Goddamn kids.

1:14:55.665 --> 1:14:57.841
They fucking killed her! He'’s lying!

1:14:58.015 --> 1:15:00.670
They'’re covering it up,
this whole sick fucking family!

1:15:00.844 --> 1:15:03.586
No one killed your daughter!
She died!

1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:05.631
She died
with a needle in her arm, man!

1:15:05.805 --> 1:15:07.851
I will kill her
right in front of you!

1:15:08.025 --> 1:15:10.810
You'’re gonna
get yourself killed!Go get him!

1:15:10.984 --> 1:15:12.508
Put the gun down.

1:15:12.682 --> 1:15:14.466
I will do it, Murphy.
I'’ll kill these motherfuckers.

1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:16.076
Everyone has to know
what they did.

1:15:16.250 --> 1:15:18.383
It'’s not gonna
bring her back, man.

1:15:24.563 --> 1:15:27.000
Arrest the Nichols.

1:15:27.174 --> 1:15:30.047
Put your hands right there.
Freeze!Go, go. Go!

1:15:30.221 --> 1:15:31.570
Me?Yes.

1:15:31.744 --> 1:15:33.137
On your knees now!

1:15:33.311 --> 1:15:35.008
Why?

1:15:35.182 --> 1:15:38.142
You have the right
to remain silent.

1:15:58.510 --> 1:16:00.425
She'’s hurt her hand.

1:16:00.599 --> 1:16:02.732
She'’s-- Her hand is broken.

1:16:06.083 --> 1:16:07.084
Let her walk.

1:16:28.845 --> 1:16:30.281
Good work.

1:16:39.507 --> 1:16:41.771
Jesus Christ,
you'’re a fucking mess.

1:16:41.945 --> 1:16:44.948
Oh, God. You know,
help is on its way.

1:16:45.122 --> 1:16:46.776
All right?
You'’re gonna be good.

1:16:46.950 --> 1:16:48.212
All right?

1:16:50.736 --> 1:16:51.824
Thank you.

1:16:53.260 --> 1:16:54.261
I'’m sorry.

1:16:55.872 --> 1:16:57.438
Life'’s not fucking fair.

1:16:58.831 --> 1:17:00.093
Melissa knows.

1:17:05.098 --> 1:17:06.622
You weren'’t the bad guy.

1:17:09.102 --> 1:17:11.452
I'’ll get a medic.
Stay right here.

1:17:28.426 --> 1:17:30.558
Checking in on you.

1:17:30.733 --> 1:17:35.912
I don'’t know where you
ended up, but I don'’t like
how we last spoke, man.

1:17:36.956 --> 1:17:38.479
I know life ain'’t fair.

1:17:38.654 --> 1:17:42.919
I know what it'’s like
to lose my family to the job.

1:17:45.225 --> 1:17:48.925
But you'’re a good man,
and you know that I know
that you'’re a good father.

1:17:50.100 --> 1:17:53.581
Nothing gets us ready
for that mission

1:17:53.756 --> 1:17:55.366
of being a dad, right?

1:17:57.629 --> 1:18:00.501
Melissa is a good girl.

1:18:00.676 --> 1:18:02.547
She don'’t deserve
to be in the mess she'’s in.

1:18:02.721 --> 1:18:06.420
But then whoever does?

1:18:06.594 --> 1:18:08.379
Look, if you find her,
just hug her.

1:18:09.597 --> 1:18:12.122
Tell her everything'’s
gonna be all right.

1:18:13.166 --> 1:18:15.168
She just wants her dad.

1:18:16.953 --> 1:18:18.128
You hear me?

1:18:26.919 --> 1:18:28.399
Listen, don'’t let her go.

1:18:28.573 --> 1:18:33.839
This world is a fucking cruel
and unforgiving place,

1:18:34.013 --> 1:18:37.234
and that'’s why they send men
like me and you out there

1:18:38.235 --> 1:18:39.932
into the dark places.

1:18:41.281 --> 1:18:44.371
If anyone lays a hand on her
and hurts her,

1:18:44.545 --> 1:18:47.853
then make sure
they get what they deserve,
every last one of them.

1:19:37.337 --> 1:19:39.557
She'’s haunting me,
isn'’t she?
