-you just start getting angry.

-Maurice, what do you want?
-[laughs mockingly]

02:46.760 --> 02:48.720
-I'm looking for Shun.
-He's eating a pastry.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.120
Pastry. Mm, that's nice.
What kind of pastry is it?

02:51.200 --> 02:52.040
[Deborah] Why does that matter?

02:52.120 --> 02:53.400
[Maurice] Is it an almond pastry?
Is it a croissant?

02:53.480 --> 02:55.280
-What kind of pastry is it? Shun!
-Maurice, are you gonna explain

02:55.360 --> 02:57.120
why you're here?
Or are you just gonna keep pretending

02:57.200 --> 02:59.000
it's 'cause you want to know
what sort of pastry Shun's eating?

02:59.080 --> 03:00.600
Why won't he come home?

03:00.680 --> 03:02.320
He's just staying here
a couple of days to sleep everything off.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.040
-I'm coming in.
-No, no, no. Stop that!

03:04.120 --> 03:05.640
-Please, Deborah, out of the way.
-No! This is my house!

03:05.720 --> 03:07.360
-Yeah, well, my friend is in there
-Fuck off!

03:07.440 --> 03:09.960

-[Deborah] What are you talking about?

03:10.040 --> 03:11.840
Come on! Let's get, let's go.
I wanna talk to you.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.120
I'm eating a chocolate.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.320
-Yeah, put the chocolate down.
-Chocolate delight.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.880
Put the pastry down
and get dressed. Come on.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.960
I will talk with Carol
about you hippopotamus!

03:21.040 --> 03:24.120
-It's a little bit late for that, Shun.
-I promise. Never will drink again!

03:24.240 --> 03:25.840
I will not even have tiny quaff.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.280
Not even tiny grape
in case turn into wine in my stomach!

03:28.360 --> 03:29.880
It's just interesting
this is where you run to.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.480
Oh, Maurice, you're being ridiculous.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.480
If you want to be angry with me
just be angry with me.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.680
-Don't take it out on Shun.
-[Maurice] I'm not angry with you.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.760
-Yes, you are.
-[Maurice] I'm not.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.160
Sit down and eat your breakfast.
Just ignore him.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.400
[Maurice] You're the one who's angry.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.000
Seducing literally
hundreds of poor vulnerable men

03:42.080 --> 03:44.040
like some puffed-up Agony Aunt.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.400
-What?
-Condoms bloody everywhere, I hear.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.000
Maurice, if I'd been
sleeping with hundreds of men

03:47.080 --> 03:48.760
I would be dead from exhaustion.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.120
At least I've got some dignity.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.400
What's dignified about barging in here
and shouting at Shun about a pastry?

03:53.480 --> 03:55.280
Well, it's too big, isn't it?
It's not a pastry,

03:55.360 --> 03:57.320
it's a fucking loaf of bread!
What are you feeding him?

03:57.400 --> 04:00.280
And what the hell is that doing out?
Like some sordid trophy?

04:00.360 --> 04:02.800
-I have a reading this evening.
-[Maurice] Oh, you have a reading.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.680
Did it not occur to you
how this might come across to people?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.520
Hmm? What were you fucking thinking?

04:07.600 --> 04:10.360
And, for the record, Dr Malone thinks
I'm handling all of this really well

04:10.440 --> 04:12.480
considering I've got
a major depressive disorder

04:12.560 --> 04:14.840
and abandonment issues
because my father ran off and drowned

04:15.120 --> 04:18.000
-when I was a little boy!
-Oh, stop talking about how sad you are.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.560
[Maurice] It's not sadness,
it's a disease!

04:19.680 --> 04:22.040
I know that. Shun, what are you doing?

04:22.160 --> 04:24.000
Be careful with that. Put it down.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.960
[Shun] [sighing] Fucking idiot.

04:26.360 --> 04:27.760
-Too much shouting all the way.
-Just come this way.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.720
-Go and get dressed, Shun.
-Why you come here?

04:39.200 --> 04:41.240
Look, the truth is
I always thought you were a...

04:42.200 --> 04:45.000
kind, interesting, selfless...

04:45.960 --> 04:49.760
man, just trying to break free from this
fog of whatever it is you want to call it.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.680
-Major depressive disorder.
-We'll just call it depression, Maurice,

04:52.760 --> 04:54.520
it's not a Nobel Prize.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.880
You got no idea
what it's like, have you? No idea!

04:56.960 --> 04:58.720
I met a lot of people
while writing this book

04:58.800 --> 04:59.680
who have suffered
an awful lot more than you.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.280
What's worse than wanting to die?

05:01.360 --> 05:04.080
-Being dead for instance.
-You've met some dead people, have you?

05:04.280 --> 05:05.760
-You've really lost the plot now.
-What I've discovered, Maurice,

05:05.840 --> 05:07.760
if you'll let me finish,
is you are not a kind,

05:07.840 --> 05:10.400
interesting, selfless, beautiful man.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.400
Well, you are, a bit.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.600
But you're also...

05:17.840 --> 05:21.440
just quite boring a lot of the time.

-Are you alright?
-[Maurice] Yeah. Never better.

-It's gotta be done, eh, Shunny Boy?
-[chuckles sarcastically]

06:04.160 --> 06:06.880
Just run one hundred meter,
already he's completely exhausted.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.080
What? [chuckling]
So how's it going with...

06:10.680 --> 06:12.280
-AUMSK?
-[ladies laughing]

06:12.840 --> 06:13.680
You mean Omsk.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.160
[Dolores] It's good. We're, erm...

06:15.840 --> 06:17.280
We're just trying to
interpret these scores.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.520
[Maurice] Right.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.000
Cool.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.440
-Your daughter's mental.
-[Maurice] Yeah. [chuckles]

06:22.840 --> 06:23.920
[Amy] Morning!

06:24.320 --> 06:27.440
-Is everyone ready?
-[Avelaine] Er, no, not really.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.080
We just woke up, Amy.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.240
[Amy] I went for a swim.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.600
I went for a swim,
and I cracked it like a coconut!

06:31.680 --> 06:32.840
[Maurice] That's good.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.600
-Really good.
-[Pan] Is your eye okay?

06:34.680 --> 06:36.000
Yeah, it's just hay fever.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.560
Dad, do you know where the eye drops are?

06:37.680 --> 06:38.840
Ah, no, I don't know.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.640
Your mother likes to hide things like that

06:40.720 --> 06:42.760
-in all sorts of illogical places.
-Guys, I'll see you there!

06:42.840 --> 06:44.760

06:46.000 --> 06:47.240
Baumgaertners!

06:56.560 --> 06:58.720
Come to think of it,
strange decision to write a book

06:58.800 --> 07:00.480
about someone so boring
in the first place.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.200

<i>-Sorry about that.</i>
-Maurice, stop being so stupid.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.000
Stupid? I thought I was just boring.

-Make your mind up.
<i>-Can I speak to Amy, please?</i>

07:13.520 --> 07:15.400
I just, I thought,
maybe she seemed a bit off.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.120
Yeah, or maybe, Deborah,
she's just flourishing,

07:18.520 --> 07:22.400
<i>because her neurotic mother's not there</i>
<i>to stifle her by constantly begging </i>

07:22.560 --> 07:25.160
for attention with
passive-aggressive gestures of good will

<i>which are quite obviously born </i>
<i>of some pathological desire to be needed,</i>

07:28.560 --> 07:32.480

and destructive book is a perfect example.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.920

the love of your life, Dad.

07:45.040 --> 07:45.880
Donald,

07:46.200 --> 07:47.040
it-- Listen.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.440
When you've been with someone as long as
we've been together, you'll understand.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.360
Understand what?

07:51.560 --> 07:53.880
That telling someone who's just spent ages
writing a really thoughtful book

07:53.960 --> 07:55.840
to shove it up their arse is a good idea.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.880
No. Just that everything dies.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.960
And that includes relationships.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.280
-What's the point in getting married then?
-I don't know.

08:04.600 --> 08:05.600
Good point.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.480
Eat more happy pills!

08:07.680 --> 08:08.720
Donald, that's not how they work.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.440
When I get married, I'm not gonna
stand around in my tiny blue pants.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.040
I'm gonna make dang sure that I do
everything in my power to guarantee

08:14.120 --> 08:15.800
that they love me until they die.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.480
Obviously, they'll die first
because of my immaculate immune system,

08:18.560 --> 08:20.320
but until then, by God.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.760
Maybe when you've had
a bit more experience,

08:22.840 --> 08:25.160
you might have a more measured view
of what love actually means,

08:25.240 --> 08:28.640
because, you know, we all like to
think of love as this huge,

08:28.880 --> 08:33.280
beautiful thing that sweeps you along,
but actually it's not that.

08:33.400 --> 08:37.000
It's co-ordinating diaries,
and washing dishes together, and--

08:37.080 --> 08:38.000
Yeah, okay. Bye.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.320
I'm trying to teach you
a valuable lesson about life!

08:40.400 --> 08:41.640
You're boring, mate!

No! No, no, no, stop!

10:10.640 --> 10:12.880

-Fuck's sake, Lightning.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.280
What's the matter now?
Why have we stopped?

10:15.560 --> 10:18.440

this amazing eye, right?

10:18.520 --> 10:20.720
And she can see. Like, she can see,

10:20.800 --> 10:22.360
and it's a privileged view.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.080
And this is the bit
where it starts to go bad,

10:24.160 --> 10:27.440
-so it's weird and it's confusing and--
-[crunching]

10:34.880 --> 10:36.400
-I'm hungry.
-Yeah, but I mean,

10:36.520 --> 10:39.760
I'm trying to explain to you all
why this is still shit.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.440
-It's not shit.
-[Vera] We're just struggling

10:41.520 --> 10:42.960

Okay. She's trying to break the curse!

It's okay. Take your time.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.120
[Sylvia] Well...

22:12.160 --> 22:13.840
I just wanted to say...

22:15.400 --> 22:18.640
I don't think
you have the right to tell me

22:19.040 --> 22:20.400
how it works.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.560
Because I did everything I could
to help Freddy,

22:24.640 --> 22:28.800
and Freddy did everything he could
to help himself. And he still died.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.360
And...

22:32.320 --> 22:33.360
I loved him.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.480
And I looked after him.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.400
I'm sorry, Sylvia.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.920
Because you can't stop it,

22:43.760 --> 22:44.600
can you?

22:46.560 --> 22:47.720
That's the truth.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.080
[Barry grunting]

22:56.400 --> 22:58.640
[Barry continues grunting]

23:02.520 --> 23:04.680
[Barry] Ah, evening, my lady.
What you up to?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.520
Just trying to work out
how to break the curse on our family

23:07.600 --> 23:09.560
without murdering everyone
and burning the house down.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.040
Ooh. [chuckles]

23:11.120 --> 23:13.000
Well, I don't want
to disturb you, but, er,

23:13.120 --> 23:14.960
do you mind watching the baby for a bit?

23:15.040 --> 23:17.440
I'm just gonna pop myself in the shower.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.800
Oh, I don't know
what I'm meant to do with it.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.000
No, you will.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.000
That's the ticket.

23:23.640 --> 23:27.200
I, er, can't actually see anymore
'cause of the paint in my eyes,

23:27.280 --> 23:28.280
so, er...

23:30.840 --> 23:33.480
-Erm...
-[baby cooing]

23:34.120 --> 23:36.160
[sniffs] Fucking hell!

23:36.720 --> 23:37.600
Sit down.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.120
Sit. Bend half.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.200
Bend in the middle.

23:42.120 --> 23:42.960
Bend.

23:43.120 --> 23:43.960
That's it.

23:44.440 --> 23:45.280
Well done.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.480
[cooing]

24:19.960 --> 24:21.320
[knocking on door] Barry!

24:22.000 --> 24:23.080
[shower running]

24:23.160 --> 24:25.800
Barry! For fuck's sake.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.280
