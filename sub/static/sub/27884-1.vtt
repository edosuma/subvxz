What do you think I'd
look like with no hair?

02:20.444 --> 02:22.272
I don't know.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.753
You're pretty, so you could
probably rock any style.

02:25.536 --> 02:26.668
Why do you ask?

02:29.236 --> 02:30.585
Just curious.

02:31.716 --> 02:32.891
Okay.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.719
- Have a good one.
- All right.

02:34.763 --> 02:35.851
See you later.

02:40.899 --> 02:44.686
So what is identity?

02:44.729 --> 02:48.690
What are the values, the
ideologies, and practices

02:48.733 --> 02:51.214
that make us who we are?

02:51.258 --> 02:54.261
You will write an essay

02:54.304 --> 02:57.829
about your identity
and how you shape it.

02:57.873 --> 02:58.917
Who are you?

02:59.962 --> 03:01.964
How did you get that way?

03:02.007 --> 03:04.923
Be as specific as possible,
no generalities.

03:04.967 --> 03:10.015
Tell me about a specific
experience or several.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.409
Tahir.

03:13.802 --> 03:17.414
Tell us one thing
about your identity.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.087
Pork chops.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.549
Amos, another
disruption from you

03:21.592 --> 03:23.855
and you will be out of here.

03:23.899 --> 03:26.075
Sorry, go ahead, Tahir.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.947
My deen.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.340
Good.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.994
Will you tell the class
what that is?

03:34.779 --> 03:36.433
The Islamic way of life.

03:39.262 --> 03:42.918
Amos, tell us one thing
about your identity.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.184
Today, another round
of US air strikes

03:48.228 --> 03:51.970
are helping to slow the advances
of ISIS fighters in Syria.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.714
There's no word
so far on military

03:56.758 --> 03:59.891
or civilian casualties
at this time.

03:59.935 --> 04:03.155
Immigration continues
to be a hot button.

04:06.376 --> 04:09.292
Today we'll see highs
in the mid to upper 70s

04:09.336 --> 04:10.946
with just a few morning clouds

04:10.989 --> 04:13.427
that we see tapering off
in the afternoon.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.516
It is maybe the perfect day

04:15.559 --> 04:19.128
for a picnic or
an unplanned date.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.956
This week will be fairly similar

04:20.999 --> 04:24.046
with cool, dry mornings,
a few clouds,

04:24.089 --> 04:26.004
that will taper off
in the afternoons,

04:26.048 --> 04:30.226
leaving us with the perfect,
sunny spring week.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.184
Back to you, Victor.

04:32.228 --> 04:36.058

So is that your new boo?

06:22.643 --> 06:25.080
But seriously, what are we
gonna do for the talent show?

06:25.123 --> 06:26.386
We gotta come tight this year.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.213
- I'll help choreograph.
- Perfect.

06:28.257 --> 06:29.606
Yeah, me too.

06:32.914 --> 06:36.396
Why don't we leave the
choreography for me and Blaine?

06:36.439 --> 06:38.963
We don't wanna end up like
we did last year, you know?

06:39.007 --> 06:40.400
Yeah.
There's no shame.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.638
No, but look,
we'll meet up tomorrow.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.272
Work on the routine.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.447
We're gonna win this year.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.666
It's our senior year.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.581
- Senior year.
- That's right.

07:20.352 --> 07:22.069
We have some new
believers joining us today.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.878
I'm so happy you're here.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.532

- Me too.

07:25.575 --> 07:26.620

07:45.856 --> 07:48.729

happy to be here.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.252

08:29.857 --> 08:31.554
I feel great.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.947
Honestly.

08:34.296 --> 08:40.607
It's this simplicity, really.

08:42.433 --> 08:45.394
No God but Allah.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.684
Did you see this
video of Ranelle?

09:58.554 --> 09:59.599
Yeah.

10:01.426 --> 10:04.604
I guess that's why she
dropped out last year.

10:04.647 --> 10:08.172
I thought she was going
to Community College, too.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.479
She does and I like some
of these video, though.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.525
Bye.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.661
Hey, Mom, look at this video.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.576
Remember Ranelle from my school.

10:28.105 --> 10:32.719
Honey, I had the most
magical night.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.896
I went to the mosque.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.854
You know the one
my co-worker attends.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.640
They're about to ban
those places, Mom.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.729
And I heard women have
to sit in separate rooms.

10:42.772 --> 10:46.907
No, Summer, this was beautiful.

10:46.950 --> 10:52.173
I mean the people,
the lights, the smell...

10:52.216 --> 10:53.216
The prayer.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.831
Any politician looking
to ban that is an idiot.

11:07.797 --> 11:10.495
♪ Best honey on the block

11:11.714 --> 11:14.543
♪ This honey don't stop

11:20.897 --> 11:24.379
My identity is
shaped by my parents.

11:24.422 --> 11:28.165
They come from two
very different worlds.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.646
My father from a large family,

11:30.690 --> 11:34.084
my mother from a
small, broken family.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.436
Because of that,
she made her own way.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.960
Lives by her own rules.

11:40.961 --> 11:43.093
I do, too.

11:43.137 --> 11:48.011
My mother always says life is
about growth, about reinvention.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.491
I like to switch things up,

11:49.534 --> 11:51.536
explore new styles,
read new books.

11:53.321 --> 11:56.498
I dance because
my grandmother danced.

11:56.541 --> 12:00.502
Movement is one of my only
connections to my lineage.

12:01.808 --> 12:02.983
To my DNA.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.079
Mom, it's a sunny day today.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.645
Why are you wearing that?

12:16.039 --> 12:17.040
Because I want to.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.869
Why are you wearing that?

12:22.829 --> 12:24.656
You picked this
top out for me, Mom.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.790
Yeah, but I didn't tie
it up like that, Summer.

12:27.834 --> 12:31.925
Anyway, I was up late last
night reading the Quran.

12:33.535 --> 12:34.797
I swear I've never

12:34.841 --> 12:36.799
- read anything--
- Okay, Mom.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.018
I'll see you later.

12:45.155 --> 12:46.591
Hey girl.

12:46.635 --> 12:47.723
Hey, what's up?

12:49.246 --> 12:51.596
I think my mom's on something.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.815
Like drugs?

12:52.859 --> 12:55.078
No.

12:55.122 --> 12:59.430
She went to this Muslim temple.

12:59.474 --> 13:00.736
It was weird.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.564
Damn, that's tough.

13:02.607 --> 13:05.828
You remember that Muslim
bakery up in Englewood?

13:05.872 --> 13:07.177
Yeah.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.136
Yeah, my uncle got
caught up in that.

13:09.179 --> 13:12.792
Turns out their leader had
like 20 wives, 40 kids.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.185
All the women had to
like walk behind the men

13:15.229 --> 13:16.926
and bake bean pies all day.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.493
Well, they say it
was like corrupt.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.843
They was like killing
Nigerians and journalists

13:20.887 --> 13:22.125
and then they was turned around

13:22.149 --> 13:23.387
and selling bake goods and shit.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.891
What?

13:24.934 --> 13:27.632
Yeah.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.896
So, where's your uncle now?

13:29.939 --> 13:34.596
Well, he went to jail
and now he sells shoes

13:34.639 --> 13:37.120
up in Redondo Beach.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.556
He never was the same.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.864
Wow.

13:41.908 --> 13:46.303
But anyway, we about to
ace this calculus test.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.133
You study?

13:51.004 --> 13:52.788
Yeah.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.912
Yeah, that's about the only
thing there's time to do.

13:57.619 --> 14:00.274
I don't know what
it means to be a believer.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.232
Growing up,
we never went to church.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.802
I wanna be what my mother wants,

14:06.846 --> 14:08.046
but I'm scared of what I want.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.551
To be with someone,
to feel, to touch them,

14:16.594 --> 14:17.900
to dream all at once.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.208
My mother comes home
from themasjid,

14:21.251 --> 14:23.297
glowing in a light
I've never seen.

14:25.734 --> 14:26.996
It's a Godly light.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.520
One I connect to.

14:32.349 --> 14:38.007
I wanna glow like her,
but I already feel tainted.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.009
Full of a fire I can't put out.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.825
I'm sure many of us are aware

15:13.869 --> 15:17.525
of all of this
turmoil and madness

15:17.568 --> 15:21.921
that has descended upon
our nation and our world.

15:23.574 --> 15:26.969
And like you and myself,
I sit at home

15:27.013 --> 15:30.538
and I wonder and I think
about what can I do.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.756
What can you do?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.802
What can Jumu'do

15:33.845 --> 15:40.200
to relieve some of this pain?

15:40.243 --> 15:43.159
And I think about one of
the five pillars of Islam

15:43.203 --> 15:47.381
which is zakat, charity.

15:47.424 --> 15:50.253
I'm sure many of us when
we're walking down the street

15:50.297 --> 15:52.429
and we had a bad day
and we're consumed

15:52.473 --> 15:55.824
with bills and problems
and someone interrupts

15:55.867 --> 15:56.999
that thinking and they say,

15:58.958 --> 16:02.962
or they say hello, how are
you, you look beautiful today.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.660
And all of a sudden that
just changes your whole day.

16:05.703 --> 16:09.142
That may change
your whole month, inshallah.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.622
You have a pep in your step now.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.711
You poke that chest out.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.758
That's a form of charity.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.107
That is Zakat.

16:19.891 --> 16:22.024
Salaam-Alaikum, Sister Jade.

16:24.461 --> 16:25.854
It was good to see you today.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.334
Good to see you, too.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.164
This must be your daughter.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.557
Yes, this is Summer.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.081
Salaam-Alaikum, young sister.

16:36.604 --> 16:37.648
Same to you.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.217
Please, excuse her.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.698
She is new to all of this.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.178
A new believer like me.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.528
Well this is a place
for new believers.

16:47.571 --> 16:50.618
Those with love in their
hearts, seeking truth.

16:50.661 --> 16:53.447
Yes, the truth.

16:53.490 --> 16:56.798
Well, I look forward to
more truth next Friday.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.802
The truth is in you, sister.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.066
And in the Quran,.

17:05.807 --> 17:06.808
Well...

17:10.071 --> 17:12.248
Why don't you and Summer

17:12.291 --> 17:13.771
take home one of
these bean pies.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.339
I don't do pie.

17:16.383 --> 17:17.297
Starch, you know.

17:17.339 --> 17:19.907
Thank you, Imam Khalid.

17:19.951 --> 17:22.476
It's very nice of you.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.781
- Have a good day. -You too, sister.
Salaam-Alaikum,

17:28.134 --> 17:30.179
He's a nice way
to get over Jordan.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.704
Don't you ever say that.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.489
I have to say it.

17:35.532 --> 17:36.812
We all know you wanna a cupcake.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.231
Not another word.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.640
Summer, put that back on.

17:57.337 --> 17:58.338
Why?

17:58.381 --> 18:00.253
We're leaving.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.429
Girl, do you think
this is a game?

18:02.472 --> 18:04.866
I have finally found
something that makes me happy

18:04.909 --> 18:08.739
and you wanna mock it instead
of maybe learning something.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.698
Learning what?

18:10.741 --> 18:12.526
How to hide behind scarves
and holy passages

18:12.569 --> 18:15.006
instead of just saying
you wanna screw a man

18:15.050 --> 18:16.791
and finally be
accepted for once.

18:21.926 --> 18:24.103
I don't wanna hear
another word from you.

18:25.365 --> 18:28.150
You need to learn some respect.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.979
You need to be in the masjid
every weekend

18:31.022 --> 18:33.329
instead of running around
in the streets

18:33.373 --> 18:34.461
looking at stripper videos.

18:34.504 --> 18:35.549
It's art, Mom.

18:35.592 --> 18:38.291
It's trash, Summer.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.518
Now put it back on.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.931
Dinner is served.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.498
Thank you.

19:11.541 --> 19:12.953
I put extra bacon on there
for you, Summertime.

19:12.977 --> 19:15.197
Thanks.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.808
Babe, you remember Cali
from my Yoga class?

19:17.852 --> 19:20.507
Cal, yeah, sure.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.509
She's having a hip hop ballet
performance tonight

19:22.552 --> 19:23.814
and I promised her I'd go.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.555
Hip hop and ballet, you must go.

19:25.599 --> 19:26.643
I'm gonna run.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.735
Bye, Jennifer.

19:31.779 --> 19:34.173
Do you wanna come, Summer?

19:35.391 --> 19:36.653
No, I'm good.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.527
Okay.

19:40.570 --> 19:41.615
Bye, Summertime.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.225
Thanks for the sliders, babe.

19:43.269 --> 19:44.269
You got it.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.233
Why did she call me that?

19:51.277 --> 19:52.582
No idea.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.455
- Good question.
- Why?

19:55.498 --> 19:56.673
She tries stuff.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.729
Still worried about Mom?

20:10.296 --> 20:13.516
It's just a phase, Summer,
it'll pass.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.431
I mean, your mother,
she's always, you know

20:15.475 --> 20:19.174
she's discovering things
just like your grandmother.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.871
When I met your mother

20:20.915 --> 20:23.831
she was a new age Black
Panther and a Buddhist.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.747
- How does that work?
- I don't know.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.052
I don't know.

20:29.184 --> 20:33.362
She's been doing the most, dad.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.496
I can't do anything
without her spewing

20:36.539 --> 20:41.327
this religious crap on me.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.676
I don't know, you ever thought

20:42.719 --> 20:44.504
about maybe
temporarily giving in?

20:46.114 --> 20:48.247
You know, maybe even
learning about it?

20:48.290 --> 20:50.161
At least until you
graduate and move out.

20:50.205 --> 20:53.600
You mean like
converting to Islam?

20:54.470 --> 20:56.342
No.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.996
No, I mean, listen to
your mom's preaching

20:59.040 --> 21:00.998
a little bit, stroke her ego.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.697
Maybe make some friends
at the mosque.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.020
Become a little bit
more worldly.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.049
Yeah.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.404
Good.

21:15.448 --> 21:16.449

All the hatred going on
in this country lately.

22:29.086 --> 22:32.655
Plus, you know how
network television is.

22:32.699 --> 22:36.050
Folks are used to
their Jade Jennings.

22:36.093 --> 22:38.922
They get confused when an
anchor cuts their hair,

22:38.966 --> 22:41.011
so you know they'd revolt
if they saw a scarf.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.485
I think you should wear it.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.322
Be daring.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.063

22:49.106 --> 22:52.545
Yeah, and if they
tell not to, you can sue.

22:52.588 --> 22:53.850
It's discrimination.

22:58.246 --> 23:02.119
But I wanted to let
you know that I'm sorry

23:02.163 --> 23:03.773
for the way
I've been acting lately.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.560
I know Islam is special to you

23:07.603 --> 23:10.258
and I wanna try to embrace it.

23:11.868 --> 23:14.001
I need a little spirituality

23:14.044 --> 23:16.264
especially as I
prepare for art school.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.355

24:11.754 --> 24:13.277
I should probably know
in a few weeks.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.192
You know, they say
the small envelopes

24:15.236 --> 24:16.498
means you got rejected.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.152
They send emails, too.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.284
And there was early admission.

24:20.328 --> 24:23.810
I know she got one, because I
heard her crying in the bathroom.

24:23.853 --> 24:26.203
Doesn't wanna end up
like her sister Ranelle.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.118

to our routine.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.906
We'll get disqualified, Summer.

24:32.949 --> 24:35.778
Plus, where would
we even get a pole?

24:35.822 --> 24:38.999
What's your Muslim ass doing
talking about pole dancing?

24:40.827 --> 24:43.351
Shouldn't you be going shopping
for scarves at the ally?

24:43.394 --> 24:45.440

And it's important that
we know the difference,

25:29.484 --> 25:34.750
between the Jinn,
the angels and Sheitan.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.926
They all influence
our relationships

25:36.970 --> 25:38.058
with almighty Allah

25:39.625 --> 25:41.191
Angels are made of light.

25:42.323 --> 25:43.411
They have no free will.

25:43.454 --> 25:44.978
Their will is that of Allah.

25:46.370 --> 25:49.635
The Jinn, however,
is made of fire.

25:49.678 --> 25:52.638
There are males and females

25:52.681 --> 25:56.598
living in another universe
with free will.

25:56.642 --> 26:00.210
The Jinn, like us, choose
whether to give in,

26:00.254 --> 26:02.865
to bow in adherence to disbelief

26:02.909 --> 26:05.085
or to accept the truth.

26:05.128 --> 26:09.698
To use their fire to burn
or warm their worlds.

26:13.789 --> 26:16.052
So, what makes us
different from Jinn?

26:18.446 --> 26:23.625
We are not born of fire,
but of clay.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.671
We have free will,
but with free will,

26:25.714 --> 26:29.457
humans can mirror
the most evil of jinn.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.894
It's upon Allah.

26:31.938 --> 26:35.637
It is our task with Islam
to resist that evil,

26:35.681 --> 26:37.900
to take the straight path.

26:37.944 --> 26:42.644
The path away from drugs,
away from meaningless sex,

26:42.688 --> 26:46.909
away from ignorance
and I know that's hard

26:46.953 --> 26:53.612
with social media and posting
selfies every five minutes.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.483
It's tough for Allah.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.267
My teams know
what I'm talking about.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.312
Right?

27:25.252 --> 27:27.950
Ranelle is in those leaps.

27:27.994 --> 27:30.953
I heard she got another
video coming out next week.

27:34.348 --> 27:36.132
I'm taking the Shahada
next Saturday.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.176
The what?

27:39.266 --> 27:41.050
It's like the official prayer

27:41.094 --> 27:42.835
you recite to become a Muslim.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.230
Wow.

27:47.274 --> 27:48.536
Okay.

27:49.755 --> 27:53.454
So, that's like official now?

27:56.239 --> 27:57.676
No turning back?

27:59.547 --> 28:00.679
No turning back.

28:04.291 --> 28:05.596

28:13.561 --> 28:16.259

in a scarf.

28:16.303 --> 28:17.608

at the mosque today.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.343
And now, you're drunk.

30:25.432 --> 30:29.131

you saw me here.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.263
No one at the mosque.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.005

We couldn't go a week
without him asking,

32:49.576 --> 32:51.578
when are you going
to make the pancakes?

32:54.059 --> 32:56.322
Well, I'm sure
he still wants some.

32:56.365 --> 32:57.801
Ew.

32:57.845 --> 32:59.978
All Jennifer knows
how to make is sliders.

33:02.632 --> 33:04.547
She tried to make pancakes
and they were all

33:05.418 --> 33:08.029
big and lumpy.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.353
One wasn't even done
all the way.

33:10.597 --> 33:11.772
It was gross.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.519
I don't care
what my family says.

33:19.562 --> 33:22.087
I've never felt
this way about anyone.

33:23.218 --> 33:24.654
I understand.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.787
Love is very complex.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.486
I'm gonna be with her.

33:30.530 --> 33:33.750
I'm tired of meeting girls
my father forces me to.

33:33.794 --> 33:37.276
Just because
they are a good Muslim.

33:37.319 --> 33:41.889
Stacey may not be a Muslim,
but she had a rough past,

33:41.932 --> 33:44.457
but I want her so bad.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.025
My dad say I need to marry
somebody pure.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.419
Follow your heart, Jusuf.

33:50.463 --> 33:52.639
But be smart.

33:52.682 --> 33:55.381
Don't let your father
dictate your life.

33:55.424 --> 33:56.773
Be with this woman.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.994
Bring her to our masjid,

34:00.038 --> 34:03.780
but know that things might not work
out the way you have envisioned.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.782
If she doesn't convert

34:05.826 --> 34:07.349
Allah knows best.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.830
I'll speak to your father
and help him understand.

34:25.106 --> 34:26.306
We still got to overcome that.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.501
You know the part.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.069
Good.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.420
We'll get it.

34:35.464 --> 34:39.033
So, how's the
Muslim thing going?

34:41.034 --> 34:43.168
It's Muslim, Tati, not Muslim.

34:44.342 --> 34:45.474
I guess.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.252
You're not gonna wear that
in the show though, right?

34:51.437 --> 34:52.873
What?

34:52.916 --> 34:53.786
My scarf?

34:53.830 --> 34:55.527
Yeah, your scarf.

34:56.529 --> 34:58.400
It's not sexy.

34:58.444 --> 35:02.665
You look like someone's
substitute teacher.

35:04.058 --> 35:05.122
I know your mom is
making you do this,

35:05.146 --> 35:07.409
but I wanna win.

35:07.453 --> 35:10.543
My mom is not making me
do anything, Tati.

35:10.586 --> 35:13.937
Look,

35:13.981 --> 35:15.330
Imam says come as we are.

35:16.897 --> 35:18.116
I'm a Muslim, Tati.

35:18.159 --> 35:19.160
Yeah.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.162
And I'm a Jehovah's Witness.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.948
Just got back from knocking
on doors this morning.

35:24.992 --> 35:27.647
That's not funny, my
grandma's a Jehovah's Witness.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.170
I don't care.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.321
You can't just change
your religion one day.

35:30.345 --> 35:31.825
It doesn't work like that.

35:31.868 --> 35:33.653
But you change
football players every week,

35:33.696 --> 35:34.976
so what's really going on, Tati?

35:50.713 --> 35:51.975
That was cold, Summer.

35:52.019 --> 35:53.281
So is intolerance.

35:55.196 --> 35:56.241
She'll get over it.

36:22.005 --> 36:23.877
Well, I guess practice is over.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.316
Where are you going?

36:28.360 --> 36:29.839
To the skate park.

36:29.883 --> 36:32.799
I got 'em black and blue
out there last week.

36:32.842 --> 36:36.498
Gonna kick, push,
kick, push, coast.

36:38.979 --> 36:41.111
All right, bye.

36:41.155 --> 36:42.200
See you later.

36:50.817 --> 36:51.948
Shake it off.

36:54.690 --> 36:57.215
Five, six, seven, eight.

37:15.189 --> 37:16.495
Whoa, sorry.

37:16.538 --> 37:17.800
Catch you later, all right?

37:18.758 --> 37:19.759
Hey.

37:19.802 --> 37:20.934
You okay?

37:21.674 --> 37:23.066
Yeah, good.

37:23.676 --> 37:24.807
I know.

37:24.851 --> 37:26.331
I saw the picture you posted.

37:26.374 --> 37:27.897
Halal hottie.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.334
Yeah, that's a new one.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.379
Just being myself.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.253
Are you coming
to Jumu'this Friday?

37:36.210 --> 37:37.255
Think so.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.605
Cool.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.476
Guess I see you there.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.173
I'll see you.

37:43.217 --> 37:44.653
All right, later.

38:02.062 --> 38:04.282
Hi, my name is Amina.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.023
Amina.

38:12.159 --> 38:13.116
Nice to meet you.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.597
My name is Mahasan.

38:15.641 --> 38:18.296
Means beautiful in Arabic.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.695
My name is Anisa.

38:27.740 --> 38:30.308
No, not Anissah.

38:30.351 --> 38:31.961
Anisa.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.485
Jade?

38:33.528 --> 38:34.964
No.

38:35.008 --> 38:38.359
My name is Anisa Mohamed.

38:38.403 --> 38:39.752
Pleasant companion.

38:45.235 --> 38:46.236
A name change?

38:46.280 --> 38:47.237
Jade, are you serious?

38:47.281 --> 38:48.630
Yes.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.502
Haven't you put
Summer through enough

38:50.545 --> 38:51.957
and now, you wanna spring this
on her in her senior year.

38:51.981 --> 38:54.201
I'm not springing
anything on her, David.

38:54.244 --> 38:55.898
I introduced her to the truth.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.422
No, it is your truth, Jade.

38:57.465 --> 38:59.598
It is your truth.

38:59.641 --> 39:01.817
You know why things
didn't work out between us,

39:01.861 --> 39:04.864
because you keep switching
things up and keep changing.

39:04.907 --> 39:07.606
You cannot
build a life like that.

39:38.463 --> 39:39.657
What did I tell
you about the bean pie?

39:39.681 --> 39:41.248
No, stop it.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.685
These are beautiful, right?

39:43.729 --> 39:45.426
What do you think about this?

39:45.470 --> 39:46.558
I can rock it.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.168
Yeah.
I think you could.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.125
I'll take this one.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.170
Anything else?

39:50.213 --> 39:51.693
No, just that today.

39:51.737 --> 39:53.608
You know, you always
get my money.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.177
I'll be back.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.876
Salaam-Alaikum, sister Jade.

40:05.054 --> 40:06.229
Hey, Tahir.

40:06.273 --> 40:07.796
- Hey.
- How are you?

40:07.840 --> 40:09.319
Good, how are you?

40:09.363 --> 40:11.409
Good. Good.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.062
Did you enjoy Jumu'

40:13.106 --> 40:14.542
Yeah.

40:14.586 --> 40:16.762
- You? -Yeah. Yeah.
It was awesome.

40:16.805 --> 40:18.807
It was very cool.

40:18.851 --> 40:21.027
So, about that hang?

40:21.070 --> 40:22.028
- Let's do it.
- Yeah?

40:22.071 --> 40:23.725
- Yeah.
- Pizza?

40:23.769 --> 40:24.987
- I love pizza.
- All right.

40:25.031 --> 40:26.336
Very good.

40:26.380 --> 40:27.903
Are you okay?

40:29.470 --> 40:30.732
Yeah.

40:30.776 --> 40:32.386
Yeah.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.911
I just remembered that
the storm is coming, so...

40:39.393 --> 40:40.481
Not bad.

40:41.134 --> 40:42.265
Told you.

40:42.309 --> 40:44.398
These pepperonis no joke, man.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.488
How would you know if you've
never had the real thing?

40:47.532 --> 40:49.751
I mean, who defines what's real?

40:51.927 --> 40:55.801
So, what's with this whole
Muslims can't eat pork thing?

40:55.844 --> 40:57.455
Pigs are unclean animals.

40:57.498 --> 40:59.544
They can give you worms.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.763
Aren't all animals unclean?

41:01.807 --> 41:04.070
I mean, have you
smelled those cows

41:04.113 --> 41:05.550
on the side of the freeway

41:05.593 --> 41:07.136
when you're coming up
the Bay on the five?

41:07.160 --> 41:08.378
They smell like hot ass.

41:09.684 --> 41:10.705
I literally throw up in my mouth

41:10.729 --> 41:11.991
when we're passing them.

41:13.862 --> 41:15.429
And here we are.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.996
Eating all those
same old stinky cows.

41:17.039 --> 41:19.172
I mean, we're eating halal cow.

41:19.215 --> 41:21.522
I mean, we pray over it,
dance light.

41:25.047 --> 41:26.266
Interesting.

41:29.922 --> 41:32.838
You're mom cool
with you being here?

41:32.881 --> 41:35.362
I told her I was
hanging out with some friends.

41:37.016 --> 41:39.105
Why lie?

41:39.148 --> 41:42.151
Because if she knew I was
corrupting some Muslim boy

41:42.195 --> 41:44.676
and ruining her
reputation at the masjid,

41:44.719 --> 41:45.894
she'd have a fit.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.508
So, you're corrupting me?

41:53.511 --> 41:55.077
What did you tell your parents?

41:56.296 --> 41:57.515
Hanging with you.

41:58.820 --> 42:00.082
What?

42:00.126 --> 42:01.997
They're surprised.

42:02.041 --> 42:06.001
I just thought Muslims can't
really do this kinda thing.

42:06.045 --> 42:08.047
Like what kinda thing?

42:08.090 --> 42:10.092
You know.

42:10.136 --> 42:13.966
Hanging out with someone
of a different sex.

42:14.009 --> 42:15.794
Eating beef pepperoni
on paper plates.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.537
You know what I mean.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.629
My folks are super cool, Summer.

42:24.672 --> 42:26.631
My mom does hair in Englewood

42:26.674 --> 42:29.895
and my parents met at a club.

42:31.940 --> 42:34.203
I told them
I'll bring you by later.

42:37.032 --> 42:38.251
Wow.

42:42.385 --> 42:43.465
I think I want another one.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.432
Damn, girl.

42:45.475 --> 42:47.695
Really, I love pepperoni.

42:47.739 --> 42:49.958
I can see that.

42:50.002 --> 42:51.743
Let me hook you up
right quick though.

42:51.786 --> 42:53.962
- Okay. -You have to put a
little bit of this on there.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.574
Try that.

42:56.617 --> 42:58.314
Thanks a lot.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.288
Okay.
One moment.

43:20.467 --> 43:23.426
So, how do you know
we're not Jinn?

43:23.470 --> 43:24.993
What do you mean?

43:25.037 --> 43:27.605
Like we could be living
in a parallel universe

43:27.648 --> 43:28.823
and not even know it?

43:28.867 --> 43:30.825
Allah knows.

43:30.869 --> 43:32.653
He gave us the Quran,
so we know.

43:32.697 --> 43:35.395
But I thought there was
different types of Jinn.

43:35.438 --> 43:38.485
Yeah, I mean,
there's Sila, usually women,

43:38.528 --> 43:41.270
intelligent shape-shifter.

43:41.314 --> 43:42.620
Like me

43:44.970 --> 43:48.713
So, have you been Muslim
since you were born?

43:48.756 --> 43:50.497
Yeah.

43:50.540 --> 43:51.890
Gosh. What was that like?

43:53.413 --> 43:54.936
I guess it's like
everything else.

43:54.980 --> 43:56.721
I don't think about it much.

43:59.985 --> 44:01.987
Do you ever get scared?

44:02.030 --> 44:04.293
Scared of what?

44:04.337 --> 44:07.862
I heard about the mosque
being torched in Lancaster.

44:07.906 --> 44:09.492
I don't know. It just seems
like it could be hard.

44:09.516 --> 44:11.039
No harder than being black.

44:17.089 --> 44:20.048
Have you ever kissed?

the most gracious,

44:58.478 --> 44:59.827
the most merciful.

45:01.307 --> 45:04.136
Hey, this is Summer.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.530
This is my mom, Rasheedah.

45:07.574 --> 45:09.184
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:09.228 --> 45:11.032
- Nice to meet you, Summer.
- Nice to meet you, too.

45:11.056 --> 45:12.753
Cute color.
You did that?

45:12.797 --> 45:13.928
Yeah.

45:13.972 --> 45:15.408
Wow.

45:15.451 --> 45:18.280
And this, hey,
this is my dad, Dawud.

45:21.066 --> 45:22.415
Would you like some bean pie?

45:22.458 --> 45:24.460
No, we just had churros.

45:24.504 --> 45:25.679
Thank you, ma'am, but I...

45:25.723 --> 45:27.115
Who are you calling "ma'am"?

45:27.159 --> 45:30.292
And no one refuses
Dawud's bean pie.

45:38.257 --> 45:40.912
It's like 10 times better
than the one at the masjid.

45:40.955 --> 45:42.087
And you're honest.

45:42.130 --> 45:43.479
Come have a seat.

45:49.355 --> 45:52.532
So, Summer, your mom is
new to the masjid, correct?

45:52.575 --> 45:53.794
She is.

45:53.838 --> 45:55.448
She loves it.

45:55.491 --> 45:57.667
They can't get her
to take off her scarf.

45:57.711 --> 45:59.365
How do you feel about it?

45:59.408 --> 46:00.496
It's cool.

46:00.540 --> 46:03.108
I mean, it's a new religion.

46:03.151 --> 46:04.762
Learning a lot more
than I ever have.

46:04.805 --> 46:06.676
Like beef pepperoni.

46:08.200 --> 46:09.655
You took her to
Muhammad Mega Pizza Grill.

46:09.679 --> 46:11.116
Yeah.

46:11.159 --> 46:12.944
That's my boy.

46:12.987 --> 46:14.791
See, the one way to a Muslimah's
heart, beef pepperoni.

46:14.815 --> 46:16.599
Stop it.

46:16.643 --> 46:18.427
You two are just friends, right?

46:18.471 --> 46:19.864
Yes, Miss Rasheedah.

46:19.907 --> 46:21.953
- Don't worry.
- We won't.

46:21.996 --> 46:23.781
You can go upstairs if you like

46:23.824 --> 46:26.784
unless you wanna watch
your father's team lose.

46:26.827 --> 46:27.828
I take great joy in that.

46:27.872 --> 46:29.221
Let's go.

46:29.264 --> 46:31.179
Summer, I live with
a family of traitors.

46:32.050 --> 46:33.442
Traitors, my ass.

46:33.486 --> 46:35.227
I'm from the Bay anyway.

46:35.270 --> 46:36.271
Dub nation.

46:36.315 --> 46:38.578
Common man.

46:38.621 --> 46:40.145
Your team ain't going nowhere.

46:40.188 --> 46:41.624
- Yeah.
- But home.

46:43.539 --> 46:47.979
Okay, so you win the award
for the coolest parents ever.

46:48.022 --> 46:50.416
I can't believe
they let us up here.

46:51.460 --> 46:52.592
Why wouldn't they?

46:53.723 --> 46:54.724
Yeah.

46:54.768 --> 46:55.813
Why wouldn't they?

46:55.856 --> 46:58.816
We're two upstanding students.

46:58.859 --> 47:00.208
What could we possibly doing

47:00.252 --> 47:01.862
in this room
other than studying?

47:08.913 --> 47:12.612
You heard back already?

47:12.655 --> 47:16.050
No, it's just some letters
about possible scholarships.

47:17.095 --> 47:18.923
That's good.

47:18.966 --> 47:21.273
I haven't heard shit.

47:22.404 --> 47:23.666
No?

47:23.710 --> 47:24.990
Don't wanna end up like Ranelle.

47:26.278 --> 47:27.888
That's not funny.

47:27.932 --> 47:29.585
I'm serious. I'll be...

47:29.629 --> 47:31.631
She's like famous now.

47:31.674 --> 47:33.807
She's making
serious money, I heard.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.698
Come on, Summer, you're
not gonna be like Ranelle.

47:35.722 --> 47:38.333
I mean, unless you keep
posting those halal hottie pics

47:38.377 --> 47:40.205
on Instagram, I don't know.

47:54.132 --> 47:55.655
It looks like
you started a movement.

48:02.183 --> 48:03.793
I should go.

48:06.361 --> 48:07.667
But thank you for today.

48:08.929 --> 48:10.148
The pepperoni.

48:13.716 --> 48:15.153
I'll see you later.

48:15.196 --> 48:16.196
Yeah.

48:28.688 --> 48:34.563
O Allah, I ask You,
of Your Knowledge,

48:34.607 --> 48:39.917
for guidance and of Your
power, for strength,

48:39.960 --> 48:44.747
and I ask You of Your
excessive generosity.

48:44.791 --> 48:49.752
Certainly You are powerful
and I am not.

48:51.972 --> 48:56.716
And You are the Knower
of the unknown.

48:56.759 --> 48:58.544
If you know
this matter to be good

48:58.587 --> 49:04.115
for my religion, my worldly
life, my life in the next world,

49:04.158 --> 49:08.206
my present state of affairs
or my future state,

49:08.249 --> 49:10.817
then decree it for me
and make it easy

49:11.905 --> 49:13.211
and bless me in it.

49:16.562 --> 49:21.175
And if You know this matter
to be detrimental

49:21.219 --> 49:24.831
to my religion,
my worldly life, my life

49:24.874 --> 49:28.269
in the next world,
my present state of affairs

49:28.313 --> 49:30.880
or my future state,
then divert it from me

49:30.924 --> 49:35.668
and turn me away from it
and decree from me that

49:35.711 --> 49:39.715
which is good
wherever it may be.

49:41.543 --> 49:44.590
And then make me
to be pleased with it.

49:59.692 --> 50:02.216
I think
she's a Muslim now, yeah.

50:02.260 --> 50:04.349
Changed her picture
on Facebook last night,

50:04.392 --> 50:06.481
caused a whole
shit storm of comments.

50:06.525 --> 50:08.242
I think she looks
much prettier, personally,

50:08.266 --> 50:10.007
with curly hair.

50:10.050 --> 50:12.879
I think they call it
a weave or something.

50:38.165 --> 50:39.819
Do you all need something?

50:43.170 --> 50:45.607
You'd think I got a nose job
with all the attention.

50:45.651 --> 50:48.567
- We're on in five.
- Great.

50:48.610 --> 50:51.787
Jade, you sure
you wanna do this?

52:25.185 --> 52:26.186
What's...

52:26.230 --> 52:28.145
My God.

52:30.190 --> 52:31.409
Hey guys.

52:31.452 --> 52:33.628
Damn, Summer.

52:33.672 --> 52:35.891
I didn't know
you got down like that.

52:36.892 --> 52:38.546
Like what?

52:38.590 --> 52:40.461
Tati, are you still mad
from the other day?

52:40.505 --> 52:41.854
I think it's time
to get over it.

52:41.897 --> 52:44.726
If I was you,
I'd be trying to get away

52:44.770 --> 52:47.338
before my Muslim mom sees this.

52:59.263 --> 53:01.569
Are you gonna
delete your accounts?

53:01.613 --> 53:03.484
It doesn't matter.
It's too late.

53:03.528 --> 53:04.572
The photos everywhere.

53:05.399 --> 53:07.140
You're a hashtag.

53:10.839 --> 53:12.232
Yeah, I kinda like it.

53:32.296 --> 53:34.080
We're in a very strange time.

53:37.214 --> 53:39.085
Everybody wants to be seen.

53:41.305 --> 53:45.309
Everybody wants to be
liked and approved of.

53:45.352 --> 53:48.529
Vanity, glamour.

53:48.573 --> 53:51.706
Fame can come right through
a cellphone screen.

53:54.143 --> 53:56.276
It's important for us
to understand

53:56.320 --> 53:58.844
that Islam is not for show.

53:58.887 --> 54:03.936
It is not to be performed
for approval, for validation.

54:06.852 --> 54:09.985
I see some of my young
Muslimahs flaunting their bodies

54:10.029 --> 54:13.511
and using Islam as
a way to be liked.

54:13.554 --> 54:15.121
Stop for Allah.

54:15.164 --> 54:17.254
As if showing your skin
wasn't enough.

54:18.342 --> 54:20.039
What did you do?

54:22.128 --> 54:25.000
But, let's not place blame
on that young person.

54:27.133 --> 54:29.527
Rather we live in a
society that promotes

54:29.570 --> 54:33.313
vanity as a means for survival,

54:33.357 --> 54:35.446
but I say to you,
young woman, stop.

54:37.274 --> 54:42.322
The last stop before your
photos become actions

54:42.366 --> 54:46.500
and the truth that you sought here
in this masjid becomes the fire.

54:47.936 --> 54:49.329
It's some Jinn burning.

55:07.173 --> 55:11.917
No, I am sorry, Imam.

55:11.960 --> 55:13.875
Summer is just a teenager.

55:13.919 --> 55:16.574
Okay, this, I promise,
will never happen again.

55:16.617 --> 55:19.141
I understand, and...

55:20.491 --> 55:23.276
I didn't want to make it public,

55:23.320 --> 55:26.018
but the photo was everywhere.

55:26.061 --> 55:27.541
Someone emailed it to me.

55:27.585 --> 55:28.585
God.

55:30.414 --> 55:31.719
Most of the people inside,

55:31.763 --> 55:33.678
they knew what
I was talking about.

55:33.721 --> 55:36.420
It's a bad representation
of our masjid

55:36.463 --> 55:39.771
especially now, with all the
bad press on Islam as it is.

55:39.814 --> 55:41.381
Salaam-Alaikum, Imam.

55:41.425 --> 55:42.556
- Jade.
- Anisa.

55:43.252 --> 55:44.950
Sorry.

55:44.993 --> 55:48.127
Imam, what you did up there
today was unacceptable.

55:48.170 --> 55:50.651
How could you target a young
teenage girl in front of everyone?

55:50.695 --> 55:52.305
You could've pulled
her aside afterwards.

55:52.349 --> 55:54.742
Sister Salam, I was
only trying to help her.

55:54.786 --> 55:56.440
By persecuting her?

55:56.483 --> 55:58.746
Telling her she's going to hell
for posting a photo?

55:58.790 --> 56:00.226
What hell is that?

56:00.269 --> 56:02.576
Listen, Rasheedah and Imam,

56:02.620 --> 56:04.448
I truly appreciate your concern,

56:04.491 --> 56:07.102
but Summer is my daughter

56:07.146 --> 56:08.408
and I will handle this.

56:08.452 --> 56:09.540
Thank you.

56:17.939 --> 56:19.550
You will not be needing that.

56:19.593 --> 56:20.942
Now come on.

56:33.041 --> 56:34.565
What the hell were you thinking?

56:36.436 --> 56:40.788
I swear I finally, finally
found a place that I like

56:40.832 --> 56:42.573
and you try to ruin it.

56:42.616 --> 56:43.854
I didn't know
this would happen, Mom.

56:43.878 --> 56:45.184
Really?

56:46.751 --> 56:48.448
Let's see.

56:48.492 --> 56:52.757
"Halal hotties make me
hard" from g1zlod.

56:52.800 --> 56:57.022
"Halal hotties on top"
from man Arab.

56:57.065 --> 56:59.720
"Halal hotties
united" from jaron22.

57:01.026 --> 57:02.331
You are a disgrace.

58:07.309 --> 58:08.876
I remember hearing my mother

58:08.920 --> 58:11.488
cry in the bathroom
and smile and laugh

58:11.531 --> 58:15.361
at breakfast with my father
as they ate pancakes.

58:15.404 --> 58:18.451
This is her encore performance.

58:22.934 --> 58:25.327
I'm becoming someone
I don't know.

58:25.371 --> 58:28.548
My mother is becoming
someone I don't know.

58:28.592 --> 58:30.071
At the masjid,

58:30.115 --> 58:32.247
I love the way
scarves feel on my skin

58:32.291 --> 58:35.947
until I get the urge to cut
them up, make them into wings.

58:38.123 --> 58:43.345
Maybe, I was born
in two bodies with one soul.

58:43.389 --> 58:46.305
I can't perform
one way of being.

58:46.348 --> 58:48.220
Society made me this way.

58:48.263 --> 58:49.700
She made me this way.

58:50.657 --> 58:52.050
I cannot be bound.

59:01.450 --> 59:04.758
Let there be no
compulsion in religion.

59:04.802 --> 59:08.414
Truth stands out
clear from error.

59:08.457 --> 59:13.941
Whoever rejects evil and
believes in Allah have grasped

59:13.985 --> 59:18.946
the most trustworthy
handhold that never breaks

59:18.990 --> 59:22.080
and Allah heareth
and knoweth all things.

59:35.267 --> 59:36.529
Put this on.

59:43.057 --> 59:45.756
And you're not performing
in that talent show.

59:45.799 --> 59:47.453
But I've been
practicing for months.

59:47.496 --> 59:49.020
I don't care.

59:49.063 --> 59:50.432
Who knows what in the hell
you and your friends

59:50.456 --> 59:51.805
got planned for
that talent show.

59:51.849 --> 59:53.720
Probably a teen
pole dancing routine.

59:53.764 --> 59:55.156
We're dancers, Mom.

59:55.200 --> 59:56.636
I'm going to school for dancing.

59:56.680 --> 59:57.637
You can't do this.

59:57.681 --> 01:00:00.379
I can and I will.

01:00:00.422 --> 01:00:02.860
And I don't wanna see you
talking to that boy Tahir.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.037
And have a good day at school.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.778
Allah be with you.

01:00:15.524 --> 01:00:16.525
Hey.

01:00:18.397 --> 01:00:20.181
Hey.

01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:23.445
Did your mom freak out?

01:00:23.489 --> 01:00:27.275
She said I couldn't go perform
in the talent show anymore.

01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:32.237
That sucks,
but the Summer I know,

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.674
would never let anyone,
not even her own mother

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.633
stop her from
dancing in that show.

01:00:41.768 --> 01:00:43.291
Come on, cheer up.

01:00:56.565 --> 01:00:57.828
All right, let's go again.

01:00:57.871 --> 01:01:00.352
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:01:10.231 --> 01:01:13.017
Tati, stay in your lane,
what are you doing?

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:17.499
Once my girl,
now my rival, I guess.

01:01:17.543 --> 01:01:19.980
Cute, you guess, all right.

01:01:20.024 --> 01:01:20.938
Okay, Tati.

01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:22.591
Watch your mouth.

01:01:22.635 --> 01:01:25.290
Ain't that what
got you on lock down

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:28.119
rocking sweat pants
and Kmart shirts?

01:01:29.598 --> 01:01:31.035
I'd rather be
wearing Kmart shirts

01:01:31.078 --> 01:01:32.732
than behind K hall
pulling my jeans down

01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:33.690
for football players.

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:34.995
Get out of my face!

01:01:37.084 --> 01:01:39.739
No, I'm not doing
this shit anymore.

01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:42.568
Come on, Blaine,
let's run it again.

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:45.266
How the hell are we supposed
to perform now, Summer?

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:48.226
Easy. We perform.

01:01:48.269 --> 01:01:50.029
We're not going to let
some slut outshine us.

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:51.925
Let's go.

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:53.294
You know that
wasn't right, Summer.

01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:55.059
You know Tati isn't a hoe.

01:01:55.102 --> 01:01:56.103
She was.

01:01:57.148 --> 01:01:58.758
Whatever, man, I'm out.

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:00.642
I've got this identity,
I say the right things.

01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:01.848
Summer, are you okay?

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:03.806
Hey.

01:02:14.078 --> 01:02:16.776
Your parents
probably hate me, too.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.299
Mom defended you, Summer.

01:02:20.432 --> 01:02:22.042
Really?

01:02:22.086 --> 01:02:23.087
Yes.

01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:29.615
We should hang out
at your house tomorrow.

01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:32.792
Yeah.

01:02:32.836 --> 01:02:34.663
But my parents won't be there.

01:02:36.187 --> 01:02:37.231
So what?

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.539
We could have
the whole place to ourselves.

01:02:42.933 --> 01:02:44.673
I don't know. Summer.

01:02:44.717 --> 01:02:46.066
What?

01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:48.415
You scared?

01:02:50.505 --> 01:02:51.855
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:30.807
Yes!

01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:13.284
So you, um, thinking about
going back to the masjid?

01:04:15.677 --> 01:04:18.245
I think my mom would
kill me if I didn't.

01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:21.640
But what do you want?

01:04:29.474 --> 01:04:31.302
Pepperoni pizza slice.

01:04:35.045 --> 01:04:36.089
For real, Summer.

01:04:43.705 --> 01:04:44.750
You.

01:04:48.275 --> 01:04:49.363
I...

01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:53.672
I want you.

01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:02.942
You probably
say that to everyone.

01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:04.117
And who is everyone?

01:05:04.161 --> 01:05:05.205
I don't know.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.992
Those girls that
send you text messages--

01:05:10.428 --> 01:05:12.647
And letters during class.
I don't know.

01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:18.479
You wanna know something?

01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:26.748
I have never been with anyone...

01:05:28.098 --> 01:05:29.098
Ever.

01:05:32.363 --> 01:05:36.019
The Instagram, the flirting...

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:39.283
It's just something to do.

01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:45.506
So...

01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:49.293
Am I just something to do?

01:05:53.688 --> 01:05:54.688
No.

01:05:56.474 --> 01:05:57.605
You're perfect.

01:05:59.085 --> 01:06:01.044
Your family, your life.

01:06:03.437 --> 01:06:08.007
I just wanna break you,
but gently.

01:06:14.535 --> 01:06:17.103
I'm not who
you think I am, Summer.

01:06:19.627 --> 01:06:21.760
Most days I don't like
going to the masjid.

01:06:23.936 --> 01:06:25.633
I think Imam Khalid is a creep.

01:06:25.677 --> 01:06:26.983
Tell your mom to watch out.

01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:28.158
My God.

01:06:29.637 --> 01:06:32.292
I knew I sensed some
creep factor in him.

01:06:36.035 --> 01:06:40.605
My family is cool, but we
have problems, too, you know.

01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:48.308
My dad tried to get
a second wife four years ago.

01:06:48.352 --> 01:06:51.268
My mom wasn't having it,
so she separated from him.

01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:54.401
Now they're trying
to get back together

01:06:54.445 --> 01:06:57.404
and things are kinda just
getting back to normal.

01:06:58.231 --> 01:06:59.667
You know?

01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:01.060
Wow.

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:02.104
Yeah.

01:07:06.848 --> 01:07:08.285
What about you?

01:07:08.328 --> 01:07:09.329
What about your dad?

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.724
He lives in Studio City.

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:13.681
Okay.

01:07:13.725 --> 01:07:14.943
With a white woman.

01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:16.032
Okay.

01:07:16.815 --> 01:07:17.729
She's okay.

01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:18.772
I guess.

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:22.734
All she knows
how to make is sliders.

01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:25.954
My mom really never got over it.

01:08:08.693 --> 01:08:09.693
It's okay.

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:58.264
♪ Come to me

01:09:02.486 --> 01:09:05.358
♪ Come to me

01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:12.538
♪ Come to me

01:09:21.765 --> 01:09:22.680
Good morning.

01:09:22.723 --> 01:09:24.334
Hi, I'm Melissa.

01:09:24.377 --> 01:09:25.770
The new weather anchor.

01:09:25.813 --> 01:09:28.425
Miles said you would
show me the ropes,

01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:30.078
but I'm just gonna
shadow for now.

01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:32.428
For now?

01:09:34.822 --> 01:09:36.301
Melisa. Um...

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.522
Tell me.

01:09:38.564 --> 01:09:40.176
Do you know
mesoscale meteorology?

01:09:42.613 --> 01:09:44.832
How about water vapor?

01:09:44.876 --> 01:09:46.965
That's when the water...

01:09:47.008 --> 01:09:48.488
When it like...

01:09:48.532 --> 01:09:49.924
You know what?

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:51.229
Just give me one second.

01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:53.014
I'm just gonna go
and check in with Miles.

01:09:53.058 --> 01:09:54.712
- Okay?
- Sure.

01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:05.853
Where is this girl?

01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:17.169
Does you mom cook lamb, Summer?

01:10:17.952 --> 01:10:19.258
Not really.

01:10:19.302 --> 01:10:21.347
Mostly pasta, pizza.

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:22.740
I'm addicted to pizza.

01:10:24.959 --> 01:10:26.787
Have you heard from
your schools yet?

01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:28.311
Not yet.

01:10:28.354 --> 01:10:30.878
I only applied to one,
CalArts, so...

01:10:30.922 --> 01:10:33.446
Hopefully, I hear back soon.

01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:35.013
You will.

01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:37.537
You remind me of myself
when I was younger.

01:10:37.581 --> 01:10:39.757
Thank you, Miss Rasheedah.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.280
And your hair is always laid,

01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:42.847
so if you don't
get in your school,

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:44.979
you can always come
work for me in my shop.

01:10:45.023 --> 01:10:46.024
Mom, stop.

01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:10.500
I should go.

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:13.241
Yeah.

01:12:13.285 --> 01:12:15.548
Um, I guess
I'll see you tomorrow?

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.508
Yeah.

01:12:18.551 --> 01:12:21.815
You want me to, you know,
walk you out?

01:12:21.859 --> 01:12:23.382
It's all good.

01:12:23.426 --> 01:12:25.558
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:18.089
Where'd you learn to cook lamb
like that, Miss Rasheedah?

01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:20.657
You should definitely
have a cooking show.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.441
I'd watch it every--

01:13:22.485 --> 01:13:24.485
I don't want you coming
over here any more, Summer.

01:13:26.576 --> 01:13:28.099
Do you think this is a game?

01:13:30.362 --> 01:13:32.320
I lost my family, Summer.

01:13:34.061 --> 01:13:35.933
To this day,
they won't speak to me

01:13:35.976 --> 01:13:37.282
because I'm a Muslim.

01:13:37.325 --> 01:13:38.762
My own parents.

01:13:41.025 --> 01:13:44.071
And you come over here
and play with this like...

01:13:44.115 --> 01:13:45.203
I need it, too.

01:13:46.334 --> 01:13:47.727
Please.

01:13:47.771 --> 01:13:50.164
We welcomed you into our home.

01:13:52.384 --> 01:13:54.081
- Why?
- Because we want each other.

01:13:54.125 --> 01:13:56.736
We both want each other.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.260
And a religion can't
stop that, I'm sorry.

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:01.524
But it won't.

01:14:04.396 --> 01:14:05.658
I love him.

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:13.623
I'm gonna call
your mother, Summer.

01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:18.018
Who knows what else
you guys have been up to.

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:24.503
You can go.

01:14:24.547 --> 01:14:25.417
I'm sorry.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:26.505
You can go.

01:15:15.815 --> 01:15:16.860
Really, Tahir?

01:15:17.425 --> 01:15:18.425
Really?!

01:15:52.591 --> 01:15:53.591
Summer.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.640
Summer.

01:16:12.872 --> 01:16:18.008
So, you wanna live here for
the rest of your senior year?

01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:21.185
What about Jennifer?

01:16:21.228 --> 01:16:22.621
What about Jennifer?

01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:24.970
Hey.

01:16:27.495 --> 01:16:29.019
You are my daughter.

01:16:30.673 --> 01:16:31.673
Okay?

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.375
Your mom's on her way.

01:16:37.418 --> 01:16:38.724
What?

01:16:38.768 --> 01:16:40.093
She just wants
to make sure you're okay.

01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:41.379
Well, tell her, I am.

01:16:41.422 --> 01:16:42.702
I don't wanna see her right now.

01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:45.252
Okay.

01:16:45.296 --> 01:16:46.819
Understood.

01:16:46.863 --> 01:16:47.994
Understood.

01:17:15.892 --> 01:17:16.893
Where is Summer?

01:17:16.936 --> 01:17:18.764
Yo. I don't know.

01:17:22.768 --> 01:17:23.768
Summer.

01:17:26.424 --> 01:17:27.817
Are you okay?

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.210
Yeah. I'm all right.

01:17:30.254 --> 01:17:31.429
You guys ready?

01:17:31.472 --> 01:17:32.691
Yeah.

01:17:32.735 --> 01:17:33.735
Let's go.

Yes.

01:19:17.404 --> 01:19:18.449
Yeah.

01:19:20.668 --> 01:19:22.148
I am smokeless fire.

01:19:24.237 --> 01:19:27.806
I'm a smokeless flame
born to an unknown mother.

01:19:30.113 --> 01:19:31.897
She looks for God in me,
but cannot find him.

01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:34.508
I look for God in me,
but I can't find him.

01:19:37.598 --> 01:19:39.949
They call them Jinn.

01:19:39.992 --> 01:19:44.649
Not people or angels,
beings with free will

01:19:44.692 --> 01:19:46.477
to do evil or good.

01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:52.918
My mother throws God at me,

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.444
but I was born a smokeless fire.

01:19:59.185 --> 01:20:00.230
She was born of clay.

01:20:03.929 --> 01:20:07.324
I may never see my mom again.

01:20:07.367 --> 01:20:09.892
She disappeared in a holy
book for another day.

01:20:12.633 --> 01:20:14.200
Thank you.

01:20:51.237 --> 01:20:52.804
Hello.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.198
Salaam-Alaikum, Anisa.

01:20:55.241 --> 01:20:56.241
Rasheedah.

01:20:57.896 --> 01:20:59.245
Are you okay, sis?

01:21:00.943 --> 01:21:02.509
No, I'm fine.

01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:03.553
What's up?

01:21:04.947 --> 01:21:06.731
Summer and Tahir.

01:21:07.775 --> 01:21:09.038
They've been--

01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:10.126
What is it?

01:21:10.169 --> 01:21:11.257
What did they do?

01:21:15.696 --> 01:21:17.394
Just take care of yourself, sis.

01:21:35.716 --> 01:21:38.284
You're tough, baby, you are.

01:21:42.158 --> 01:21:43.158
It's your mother.

01:21:44.551 --> 01:21:45.901
What is she doing here?

01:21:45.944 --> 01:21:47.772
Just tell her what
you told me, okay?

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:55.301
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:21:56.302 --> 01:21:57.564
Thank you.

01:22:03.135 --> 01:22:04.180
Summer?

01:22:08.314 --> 01:22:10.403
Yeah, get you right here.

01:22:10.447 --> 01:22:11.448
Thank you.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.672
I'm not going
back to that masjid.

01:22:20.283 --> 01:22:21.284
Me neither.

01:22:23.634 --> 01:22:25.070
I have to find a new one.

01:22:29.509 --> 01:22:31.250
I know what you did, Summer.

01:22:33.992 --> 01:22:34.992
What did you do?

01:22:36.473 --> 01:22:37.473
I...

01:22:42.261 --> 01:22:43.306
I was with someone.

01:22:45.612 --> 01:22:48.180
A boy, and...

01:22:48.224 --> 01:22:50.052
Why didn't you
come to me, Summer?

01:22:50.095 --> 01:22:53.707
You were busy, Mom,
being a Muslim.

01:22:53.751 --> 01:22:55.971
You are my daughter.

01:22:56.014 --> 01:22:58.060
And I am never too busy for you.

01:23:00.758 --> 01:23:04.588
Look, I had you when
I was way too young

01:23:04.631 --> 01:23:06.938
and I don't regret
that for a second,

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.350
but I would never
want you to go through

01:23:08.374 --> 01:23:09.767
what I went through.

01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:13.161
So...

01:23:14.554 --> 01:23:16.121
I just hope that...

01:23:17.862 --> 01:23:19.646
You used protection.

01:23:20.343 --> 01:23:21.343
We did.

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.390
And that you wanted to.

01:23:26.914 --> 01:23:27.959
I did, Mom.

01:23:32.181 --> 01:23:33.182
Okay.

01:23:44.367 --> 01:23:46.282
I should go.

01:23:46.325 --> 01:23:47.631
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:23:47.674 --> 01:23:48.762
Yeah.

01:23:49.763 --> 01:23:50.895
No.

01:23:50.938 --> 01:23:52.244
- I gotta go, David.
- Jade.

01:23:52.288 --> 01:23:53.985
- She needs you.
- No, she doesn't.

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:55.682
We need you.

01:23:57.075 --> 01:24:00.122
Hey, you did good.

01:24:00.165 --> 01:24:01.471
Thank you for coming.

01:24:04.169 --> 01:24:05.170
I just don't know.

01:24:05.214 --> 01:24:06.432
No, it's okay.

01:24:43.687 --> 01:24:45.036
My God.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.559
Yes.

01:24:46.603 --> 01:24:47.603
My God.

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.128
- What's wrong?
- I got in.

01:24:50.172 --> 01:24:51.347
I got in.

01:24:54.219 --> 01:24:55.655
My God.

01:24:55.699 --> 01:24:58.136
Okay. That's my girl.

01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:59.224
That's my girl.

01:24:59.268 --> 01:25:01.139
I'm so proud of you.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.163
Hey, Jade, you should
check this out.

01:25:31.474 --> 01:25:32.605
Wow.

01:25:36.174 --> 01:25:37.871
That's pretty great.

01:25:37.915 --> 01:25:38.785
Yeah.

01:25:38.829 --> 01:25:39.743
Well done.

01:25:39.786 --> 01:25:40.786
Thanks.

01:25:48.665 --> 01:25:50.121
You better not
forget about me, Tahir.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:52.016
How can I forget about you

01:25:52.059 --> 01:25:53.211
when I'm the one
that introduced you

01:25:53.235 --> 01:25:55.019
to beef pepperoni pizza?

01:25:55.062 --> 01:25:56.151
You owe me.

01:25:57.064 --> 01:25:58.196
How are your parents?

01:25:59.415 --> 01:26:00.764
They're good.

01:26:00.807 --> 01:26:03.897
Gosh, I miss them so much.

01:26:03.941 --> 01:26:05.638
My mom kinda misses you too.

01:26:07.074 --> 01:26:08.394
She just wants me
to go to college

01:26:08.424 --> 01:26:10.121
without having a kid first.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.297
Nothing personal.

01:26:14.995 --> 01:26:16.127
How is your mom?

01:26:17.128 --> 01:26:18.608
She's good.

01:26:18.651 --> 01:26:22.177
She's attending
another masjid in Englewood.

01:26:24.004 --> 01:26:27.573
Going on the occasional date.
Having a beer.

01:26:27.617 --> 01:26:29.009
She's doing her own thing.

01:26:30.315 --> 01:26:31.360
How are you?

01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:35.581
I'm just happy to be free.

01:26:39.106 --> 01:26:42.980
Well, how about we go get
some free beef pepperoni

01:26:43.023 --> 01:26:45.243
pizza slices?

01:26:45.287 --> 01:26:47.071
But we gotta get churros first.

01:26:47.114 --> 01:26:48.855
You're so bad for me.

01:26:48.899 --> 01:26:50.466
I know that's why you love me.

01:27:07.526 --> 01:27:09.224
Now, I know
we've been experiencing

01:27:09.267 --> 01:27:11.400
some pretty gray days
these past few weeks,

01:27:11.443 --> 01:27:14.968
but we do have a warm front
sweeping into our area

01:27:15.012 --> 01:27:17.101
in the last few weeks
of our spring.

01:27:17.144 --> 01:27:20.974
Summer, my favorite season,
is on its way.
