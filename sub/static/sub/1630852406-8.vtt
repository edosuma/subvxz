<i>Activating gate closure.</i>

00:15.348 --> 00:19.686
<i>All members,</i>
<i>evacuate to a safe zone immediately.</i>

00:19.769 --> 00:21.896
<i>Activating gate closure.</i>

00:21.980 --> 00:22.814
What happened?

00:35.577 --> 00:39.289
<i>Warning. Thermoregulator anomaly detected.</i>

00:40.665 --> 00:44.627
<i>Warning. Thermoregulator anomaly detected.</i>

01:00.185 --> 01:04.481
<i>All members,</i>
<i>evacuate to a safe zone immediately.</i>

01:04.564 --> 01:06.316
<i>Activating gate closure.</i>

01:06.399 --> 01:08.693
<i>Activating gate closure.</i>

01:08.777 --> 01:12.530
<i>All members,</i>
<i>evacuate to a safe zone immediately.</i>

01:12.614 --> 01:14.657
<i>Activating gate closure.</i>

01:14.741 --> 01:16.785
<i>Activating gate closure.</i>

01:35.595 --> 01:36.763
Open the door!

01:41.101 --> 01:42.310
Close the gate!

01:43.394 --> 01:44.395
Close it right now!

02:04.749 --> 02:05.750
You asked for me?

02:05.834 --> 02:09.629
Is there a possibility at all
that someone…

02:11.464 --> 02:13.508
survived the accident at Balhae?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.135
Sorry?

02:18.054 --> 02:18.972
Never mind.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.893
Make sure you let me know immediately
when you have an update.

02:24.686 --> 02:25.812
I'll do that, ma'am.

04:01.115 --> 04:05.578
THE SILENT SEA

04:37.277 --> 04:40.613
So we've now confirmed
she can survive contact with lunar water?

04:42.365 --> 04:43.408
Looks like it.

04:43.491 --> 04:47.203
Lunar water has similar characteristics
to a virus that changes each time

04:47.287 --> 04:48.997
it comes into contact with a new host.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.792
As we can see,
a pretty major change took place

04:52.875 --> 04:54.752
when it came into contact
with this girl here.

04:55.336 --> 04:58.006
Or at least contact
with whatever they put inside her.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.507
These researchers…

05:01.134 --> 05:05.054
at Balhae Station, studied cell fusion
and genetic recombination

05:05.138 --> 05:07.223
as ways to make humans
survive lunar water.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.352
And the organism they created as a result

05:12.270 --> 05:13.688
is named Luna.

05:15.857 --> 05:19.068
Human experiments and human cloning,

05:20.403 --> 05:21.362
both illegal.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.449
So that means…

05:25.616 --> 05:28.328
the reason the government
shut down this station five years ago

05:28.411 --> 05:30.955
was because they cared more
about hiding the experiments

05:31.039 --> 05:32.165
than about the results.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.293
If this gets out,
it'll cause a panic. I mean, shit.

05:35.835 --> 05:39.005
It's considered an act of treason
for us to disclose state secrets

05:39.088 --> 05:40.590
no matter what the secrets are.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.972
You realize, even if we swear
to never speak of this again,

05:48.056 --> 05:51.351
no one in charge will believe us
for the rest of our lives!

05:51.434 --> 05:53.269
People will watch our every move,

05:53.353 --> 05:55.855
or we might just end up dead
like the crew members here!

05:56.356 --> 05:58.524
That's why Director Choi wanted me here.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.528
I see the logic.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.239
She probably thought
I wouldn't be able to tell the truth.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.745
The atrocious crimes my sister committed
as head researcher.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.506
What happened to Lieutenant Ryu?

06:25.468 --> 06:28.012
We aren't safe here anymore.
Something's wrong.

06:28.805 --> 06:29.889
What do you mean, Captain?

06:29.972 --> 06:32.141
A shaft blew up
during my struggle with the Lieutenant.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.685
There was spurting water.

06:48.866 --> 06:49.909
Dr. Song.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.463
Are you all right?

07:06.968 --> 07:08.010
Dr. Song!

07:23.276 --> 07:25.278
What is it? Dr. Song.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.196
Let us help.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.322
Open up!

07:31.659 --> 07:32.827
I'm sorry.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.497
Are you feeling sick?

07:37.039 --> 07:38.624
Dr. Song!

07:38.708 --> 07:39.959
Wait, I…

07:40.585 --> 07:41.627
Dr. Song!

07:43.045 --> 07:44.964
Why did this happen? Open up!

07:45.548 --> 07:47.091
I'm sure we can help you!

07:47.175 --> 07:48.050
Dr. Song!

08:42.813 --> 08:43.856
<i>Jian.</i>

08:46.901 --> 08:48.819
<i>I thought it was something I had to do…</i>

08:50.905 --> 08:53.449
<i>for the sake of everyone's future.</i>

09:22.979 --> 09:25.731
Hold on, please. Wait!

09:28.234 --> 09:29.360
Close the gate.

09:29.944 --> 09:30.903
Hold on!

09:40.788 --> 09:42.206
Seal the door now!

10:21.120 --> 10:21.954
<i>Jian.</i>

10:26.500 --> 10:28.753
<i>All I wanted to do was show you the sea.</i>

10:34.467 --> 10:35.551
<i>Jian.</i>

11:03.954 --> 11:05.665
-Are you all right?
-What happened?

11:08.459 --> 11:10.336
You were infected
just like the others were.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.963
But somehow, your body's fighting back.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.764
I think…

11:23.683 --> 11:26.811
possibly, Luna's DNA,

11:27.603 --> 11:29.689
it acts like a sort of antibody.

11:29.772 --> 11:33.150
It suppresses the multiplication
of lunar water in your body.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.319
It could be you're just lucky.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.697
It's too early to tell, but…

11:39.198 --> 11:44.120
this poor girl, she just might be the key
to saving the whole world.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.545
She's Luna.

11:53.921 --> 11:54.839
What?

11:56.382 --> 11:57.800
That's her name.

11:59.009 --> 11:59.969
Luna.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.512
It appears Gisu and Lieutenant Ryu

12:43.596 --> 12:45.306
were both working for RX.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.600
We should head to Gate Seven.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.978
Shouldn't we hold our position
until the backup team arrives here?

12:51.061 --> 12:52.062
We're out of time.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.276
I need to speak with Mr. Kim.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.911
The rescue party's spacecraft
has entered the Moon's orbit.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.122
<i>We just checked the radar,</i>
<i>and it's just like you said.</i>

13:10.664 --> 13:13.042
<i>We spotted another vessel</i>
<i>entering orbit as well.</i>

13:13.542 --> 13:17.171
It's a model used by RX Corporation,
which means mercenaries are aboard.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.884
We're going to need more time
to retrieve the samples.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.346
If the mercenaries make their landing,
we won't be able to get them.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.849
Any measures you can take to delay them
would be extremely helpful.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.479
<i>All right.</i>
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

13:33.562 --> 13:35.064
What's going to happen to Luna?

13:37.983 --> 13:40.486
When she comes back to Earth,
what are you planning to do?

13:40.569 --> 13:43.072
<i>Our experiments with Luna 073</i>

13:43.155 --> 13:45.157
<i>don't even exist</i>
<i>according to the government.</i>

13:45.783 --> 13:49.245
<i>I'm afraid she'll be sent somewhere</i>
<i>within the Ministry of National Defense.</i>

13:49.328 --> 13:50.496
<i>And once she's there…</i>

13:52.039 --> 13:54.834
<i>the government will pick up the experiment</i>
<i>where the station left off.</i>

13:54.917 --> 13:56.210
It's too dangerous.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.171
Lunar water is extremely unstable.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.841
It could threaten the life
of everyone on Earth.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.260
<i>And if Luna is sent to a facility,</i>

14:04.343 --> 14:05.511
you know what that means.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.556
She'll spend her whole life
as an experiment.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.231
Did you do what we talked about earlier?

14:24.446 --> 14:28.951
Unfortunately, Director Choi holds
a strong political position.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.829
<i>So far, no one's sticking out their neck.</i>

14:33.998 --> 14:35.499
What's he mean?

14:35.583 --> 14:36.917
<i>Captain Han requested</i>

14:37.001 --> 14:38.878
<i>that I try to get in touch</i>
<i>with any high official</i>

14:38.961 --> 14:40.796
<i>who could possibly overrule Director Choi.</i>

14:41.755 --> 14:45.593
The lunar water belongs to humanity.
It cannot belong to just one country.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.469
On that, the Captain and I agree.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.764
<i>Thankfully, some in the SAA</i>

14:50.848 --> 14:53.642
<i>are starting to realize</i>
<i>that this can be the only just way.</i>

14:54.768 --> 14:56.312
<i>I will come up with something</i>

14:56.395 --> 14:58.314
before you all return home to Earth.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.570
The IISB.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.532
We cannot go back to Earth.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.411
<i>The International Institute</i>
<i>of Space Biology,</i>

15:12.494 --> 15:14.705
<i>we should be safe aboard that station.</i>

15:19.335 --> 15:21.170
We take Luna to a neutral territory,

15:21.837 --> 15:24.381
and make sure that no one
can get control of her.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.803
I can take Luna there myself.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.601
<i>First,</i>
<i>we take those samples back,</i>

15:35.684 --> 15:38.145
<i>then rendezvous with the rescue ship</i>
<i>at Gate Seven.</i>

16:23.524 --> 16:25.776
My God! What have I done?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.954
We have to let people know
why Soochan died.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.012
Location tracker.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.055
For just in case.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.897
You can put it on her…

17:46.065 --> 17:47.232
if you want.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.595
You just have to
press it right here.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.848
And in no time,
I'll fly over to save you, Dad.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.725
Yeah.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.396
That means I can always come back home,
thanks to you, Hajin.

19:09.064 --> 19:09.898
Mm.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.943
I really wish I was coming with you.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.823
Someday, I want to see the Moon too.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.412
You know, once I'm back,
I won't leave again.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.705
I promise you that.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.249
You're lying.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.209
No, I'm not lying.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.671
First thing I'd do when I'm back
is I'm going to teach you how to swim.

19:33.839 --> 19:34.798
Swim?

19:35.632 --> 19:38.844
It's a way to move around underwater,
like a fish does it.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.347
But aren't all fish dead?

20:20.010 --> 20:21.678
It looks like now she trusts you.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.474
Everything is ready.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.684
We set out in your command, Captain.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.193
As soon as Luna reaches Earth,

20:36.276 --> 20:38.195
they'll shut her away in a lab forever.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.989
There's no way those people
will ever leave her alone.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.034
That's her fate.
Her location won't make any difference.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.328
Luna is coming back home with us.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.413
You're calling her Luna now.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.252
We can't think clearly if we're desperate,

20:53.335 --> 20:55.212
and we can't afford a wrong decision.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.881
We've seen how deadly
the consequences can be.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.883
We just can't repeat the same mistake.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.098
The only choice that I can make

21:06.181 --> 21:08.433
is completing this mission
for my daughter.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.478
Hey…

21:13.188 --> 21:14.523
Are you okay?

21:18.485 --> 21:19.403
Hello?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.244
Something's wrong.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.483
Luna, what is it?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.160
Luna!

22:15.459 --> 22:17.085
She wants us to follow.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.087
Call her back.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.590
This route is the fastest way
to get to Gate Seven.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.052
Let's follow her.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.262
She knows something.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.431
She must have a good reason to do that.

22:50.827 --> 22:51.703
Run!

23:32.953 --> 23:33.829
Go.

24:23.503 --> 24:24.504
Luna!

24:25.422 --> 24:27.007
-Huh?
-This way!

24:27.090 --> 24:27.966
Hurry!

24:53.408 --> 24:54.367
What's wrong?

25:31.947 --> 25:33.073
Ryu Taesuk.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.410
You're already infected.

25:38.119 --> 25:39.204
It's all over.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.873
I just can't get them out of my head.

25:42.457 --> 25:43.333
What?

25:43.416 --> 25:44.918
I never wanted to do it.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.338
I don't want to hurt anyone.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.180
-Taesuk, just let me--
-Stay back!

26:05.564 --> 26:07.065
You knew, didn't you?

26:08.608 --> 26:09.985
What we did.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.573
Why did you try to hide it?

26:15.490 --> 26:16.700
Why did you pretend?

26:16.783 --> 26:17.951
Why did you?

26:18.994 --> 26:21.037
Why?

26:23.873 --> 26:26.710
Lieutenant Ryu, why are you doing this?

26:26.793 --> 26:28.003
We don't deserve it.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.088
We don't deserve
to have the lunar water at all.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.553
I'm sorry, Dr. Song.

26:38.471 --> 26:40.599
I'm sorry, Dr. Song. I'm sorry.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.646
Dr. Song, I'm sorry.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.817
Lieutenant, we need
to get out of here right now!

26:54.362 --> 26:55.947
No one's rescuing you.

27:12.088 --> 27:14.132
Taesuk, close the gate.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.093
Ryu Taesuk!

27:18.762 --> 27:20.138
Close it right now!

27:20.221 --> 27:21.556
Ryu Taesuk!

27:42.994 --> 27:45.830
We didn't try to save any of them.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.920
They never sent us up here for that.

28:09.604 --> 28:10.772
This ends now.

28:13.441 --> 28:14.651
Shut the door behind us!

28:34.254 --> 28:35.422
Officer Gong.

28:39.175 --> 28:42.512
I don't think that
I can hold out for long.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.519
Are you okay?

28:57.110 --> 28:58.194
Sorry.

29:22.510 --> 29:23.470
Luna!

29:56.002 --> 29:58.922
Captain, we must make your way
to the airlock right away.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.475
Officer Gong.

30:52.559 --> 30:53.643
Stay with me.

30:54.727 --> 30:55.812
It's all right.

31:01.609 --> 31:03.069
Stay with me, Officer Gong.

31:05.613 --> 31:06.990
Just a little longer.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.543
You can't fall asleep. Stay with me.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.432
You're all set.
