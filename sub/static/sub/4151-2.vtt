All right, it's --
it's gonna be over soon.

37:36.834 --> 37:38.050
And these people
are gonna help us.

37:38.085 --> 37:39.751
And we're all grateful,
Ben.

37:39.803 --> 37:41.720
But somebody's
gonna have to tell that girl.

37:41.755 --> 37:43.889
I will.

37:43.924 --> 37:45.057
I'll go with you.
No.

37:45.092 --> 37:47.759
You weren't there.
It will be okay.

37:47.811 --> 37:49.261
I'll do it alone.

37:49.313 --> 37:52.597
I'm sorry.

37:52.650 --> 37:53.932
[ Crying ]

37:53.984 --> 37:56.985
[ Roaring ]

38:01.859 --> 38:03.692
Sara: Hey.
Pope: Don't look. don't look.

38:03.694 --> 38:05.360
Come on. Can I look now?
Okay, okay, okay. All right, yeah.

38:05.362 --> 38:07.863
Nice view. No skitters, at least.
Yeah.

38:07.915 --> 38:10.582
Who did you have to call
to make it so quiet?

38:10.617 --> 38:14.252
Hey, don't jinx it.
I just sprayed the place.

38:14.288 --> 38:15.787
Wow.

38:15.839 --> 38:18.674
Here, have a --
actually, any one you want.

38:18.709 --> 38:19.791
[ Both chuckle ]

38:19.843 --> 38:21.293
Take this one.
Take this one.

38:21.345 --> 38:23.295
This is...

38:23.347 --> 38:27.182
This is nice.

38:27.217 --> 38:31.353
It's kind of like
the old normal, but...

38:31.388 --> 38:33.355
It's even better.

38:35.192 --> 38:37.142
There we go.

38:37.194 --> 38:39.144
Not quite your birthday.
Not yet, but, uh...

38:39.196 --> 38:41.363
Feels like my birthday.

38:44.902 --> 38:46.735
This is incredible,

38:46.787 --> 38:50.072
considering that our first
and last drink together

38:50.124 --> 38:52.074
was when I drugged
your beer.

38:52.126 --> 38:54.626
Ah.
[ Laughs ]

38:54.661 --> 38:56.294
Yeah.

38:56.330 --> 38:58.914
[ Sniffs ]

39:01.919 --> 39:03.418
Thank you.

39:12.930 --> 39:15.397
Medicine?

39:15.432 --> 39:18.934
Mm. Vitamin supplements,
antioxidants, minerals.

39:18.936 --> 39:20.435
You know,
help with metabolic...

39:22.406 --> 39:23.939
Wow.

39:23.991 --> 39:26.108
I, uh, tried to make it
look like a real microscope,

39:26.160 --> 39:28.944
but, um, you probably
don't need the --

39:28.996 --> 39:30.946
the stand
or the arm clamps.

39:30.998 --> 39:33.949
But should help you get
a good look at the bug.

39:34.001 --> 39:36.118
Dingaan helped.

39:36.170 --> 39:38.754
I love it. Thank you.

39:38.789 --> 39:42.257
Uh...I'm gonna go
check on her.

39:42.292 --> 39:43.842
Yeah.
Oh, okay.

39:48.882 --> 39:52.134
Hi.

39:52.186 --> 39:54.019
Hey.

39:54.054 --> 39:55.353
They have awesome snacks
in here.

39:55.389 --> 39:56.972
You should try some.

39:56.974 --> 39:59.808
I-i would, but, uh,
they said you ate them all.

39:59.810 --> 40:02.310
[ Laughs, snorts ]

40:02.362 --> 40:06.731
I...I love your laugh.

40:07.868 --> 40:10.452
Thanks.

40:15.993 --> 40:18.293
[ Laughs ]

40:20.330 --> 40:22.330
Tom: Still no skitters.
[ Sighs ]

40:22.332 --> 40:25.333
They just stopped.

40:25.335 --> 40:28.170
I can't make any sense
out of it.

40:28.222 --> 40:29.888
Well, you're all set up,
aren't you?

40:29.923 --> 40:31.389
I know.
Matt made this.

40:31.425 --> 40:32.924
Huh.

40:32.976 --> 40:36.812
Okay. From what I can see --
oh, my God.

40:36.847 --> 40:41.316
It -- it has skitter legs,
but its arms are Espheni.

40:41.351 --> 40:43.401
And it has black hornet wings
on its back.

40:43.437 --> 40:45.270
So, it is a mutation,
like we thought,

40:45.322 --> 40:47.823
only it's
a different species.

40:47.858 --> 40:51.193
Yeah, like some kind of
DNA bouillabaisse.

40:51.195 --> 40:52.861
[ Gasps ]

40:52.913 --> 40:56.198
It has human eyes.

40:56.250 --> 40:59.117
Think the Espheni are using
human DNA?

41:05.542 --> 41:07.509
Oh!
What?! What?

41:07.544 --> 41:08.877
[ Buzzing ]

41:08.879 --> 41:10.512
[ Gasps ]

41:13.217 --> 41:16.852
We got to find out
where that came from.

41:18.805 --> 41:21.439
Oh, my God.
It wasn't dead.

41:21.475 --> 41:24.059
Cunning like a human.
Where's it going?

41:24.061 --> 41:26.478
We haven't seen a skitter since
yesterday. Let's find out.

41:26.530 --> 41:29.030
Hey, don't shut it!
We're coming out!

41:29.066 --> 41:31.900
[ Buzzing continues ]

41:31.902 --> 41:33.568
Where is it?
Do you see it?

41:33.570 --> 41:35.904
[ Rumbling ]

41:35.956 --> 41:37.906
What's that sound?

41:37.958 --> 41:39.241
[ Buzzing ]

41:39.293 --> 41:41.159
What is that?
