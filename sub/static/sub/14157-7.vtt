POSSIBILITY OF YOU INVESTING IN

01:41.068 --> 01:42.002
CUT.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.171
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST

01:43.171 --> 01:44.372
IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO

01:44.372 --> 01:45.606
PERSONALLY DISCUSS YOUR

01:45.606 --> 01:47.441
IMPECCABLE TRACK RECORD WITH

01:47.441 --> 01:48.542
START-UP COMPANIES.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.543
>> WELL, I DON'T USUALLY LIKE

01:49.543 --> 01:50.944
TO BLOW MY OWN HORN, BUT--

01:50.944 --> 01:52.413
>> YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.514
'CAUSE I DON'T SEE WHY YOU'RE

01:53.514 --> 01:54.648
SO EAGER TO INVEST IN A JEWELRY

01:54.648 --> 01:55.549
LINE.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.450
I MEAN, YOU AND YOUR COMPANY

01:56.450 --> 01:58.486
ALMOST INVEST EXCLUSIVELY IN

01:58.486 --> 02:00.654
COMPUTERS AND BIOTECH START-UPS.

INDUSTRY YOU HAVE NO EXPERIENCE

02:09.197 --> 02:10.063

02:18.071 --> 02:19.106
>> GENTLEMEN, THIS IS PURELY

02:19.106 --> 02:20.073
AN EXPLORATORY MEETING.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.509
NO ONE IS DOUBTING ANYONE'S

02:21.509 --> 02:24.512
EXPERIENCE OR EXPERTISE.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.116
>> I GOTTA BOUNCE.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.018
RAQUEL WILL BE IN TOUCH.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.085

02:32.085 --> 02:35.623
RAQUEL.

02:35.623 --> 02:39.627
>> EXCUSE ME ONE MINUTE, PLEASE.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.895
TERRENCE.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.030
WHAT WAS ALL THAT?

02:43.030 --> 02:44.232
>> WHAT WAS ALL WHAT?

02:44.232 --> 02:45.233
>> I DON'T GET IT.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.234
THE GUY'S GOT A MASSIVE

02:46.234 --> 02:47.134
PORTFOLIO.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.135
I MEAN, HE'S ALL OVER FORBES,

02:48.135 --> 02:49.036
FAST COMPANY.

02:49.036 --> 02:49.970
>> YEAH, NOW HE AND HIS MASSIVE

02:49.970 --> 02:51.104
PORTFOLIO ARE TRYING TO BE ALL

02:51.104 --> 02:51.972
OVER YOU.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.006
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WE GOT

02:53.006 --> 02:53.874
THAT MEETING.

02:53.874 --> 02:54.808
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

02:54.808 --> 02:55.776
WE GOT THAT MEETING BECAUSE WE

02:55.776 --> 02:56.777
HAVE A GREAT PRODUCT, AND HE

02:56.777 --> 02:57.645
SEES THAT.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.012
>> SO DO OTHER INVESTORS.

02:59.012 --> 02:59.880
WHAT ABOUT DEROSO?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.949
THE LONDON GROUP? C.L.L.?

03:01.949 --> 03:03.116
WE HAVE INVESTORS THAT ARE

03:03.116 --> 03:04.252
CIRCLING, THAT ARE A MUCH BETTER

03:04.252 --> 03:06.554
FIT FOR US THAN HIM.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.957
LOOK, I'M SAYING WE HOLD OUT.

03:11.925 --> 03:12.793
>> OKAY, FINE.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.661
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:13.661 --> 03:14.695
HIS COMPANY ISN'T THE BEST FIT.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.629
BUT I STILL THINK THAT WE SHOULD

03:15.629 --> 03:16.530
HEAR OUT ALL POTENTIAL

03:16.530 --> 03:17.265
INVESTORS.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.566
>> TIME IS MONEY, RAQUEL.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.267
>> GOT IT.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.068
SPEAKING OF TIME, I'M GONNA NEED

03:21.068 --> 03:22.035
THOSE BRACELET SAMPLES BACK.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.103
I GOTTA GET THESE PROMO SHOTS

03:23.103 --> 03:24.272
DONE A.S.A.P.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.706
>> OKAY, UM, I CAN DROP 'EM OFF

03:25.706 --> 03:26.707
TO YOU LATER.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.708
>> OKAY.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.678
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'VE

03:30.678 --> 03:32.179
GOTTA GO TELL GRANT THAT WE ARE

03:32.179 --> 03:33.146
NOT INTERESTED.

03:33.146 --> 03:36.083
SEE YA LATER.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.153
[sighs]

03:40.153 --> 03:41.289
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.290
>> WELL, HE'S GOT SOME STRONG

03:42.290 --> 03:43.190
OPINIONS.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.292
>> [chuckles]

03:44.292 --> 03:45.559
THAT'S A VERY POLITE WAY OF

03:45.559 --> 03:46.294
PUTTING IT.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.761
BUT HE'S RIGHT.

03:47.761 --> 03:48.729
WE HAVE SOME OTHER OFFERS THAT

03:48.729 --> 03:50.731
MIGHT BE A BETTER FIT.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.733
>> MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.801
NOW MAYBE WE CAN GET TO KNOW

03:53.801 --> 03:54.935
EACH OTHER WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS

03:54.935 --> 03:56.870
GETTING IN THE WAY.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.138
>> I'D LIKE THAT.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.039
>> GOOD.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.007
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW?

04:00.007 --> 04:01.074
I'M SURE WE BOTH COULD USE

04:01.074 --> 04:02.209
A BREAK AFTER DEALING WITH YOUR

04:02.209 --> 04:04.077
PARTNER, WHO I DON'T THINK IS

04:04.077 --> 04:05.779
A MORNING PERSON, BY THE WAY.

04:05.779 --> 04:06.980
>> [laughs]

04:06.980 --> 04:07.981
I DON'T THINK HE IS EITHER, BUT

04:07.981 --> 04:08.849
I AM.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.050
AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A FEW MORE

04:10.050 --> 04:11.084
HOURS BEFORE I NEED TO OPEN

04:11.084 --> 04:13.220

04:16.824 --> 04:21.362

04:21.362 --> 04:23.096
OKAY, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS

04:23.096 --> 04:24.365
IS YOUR IDEA OF TAKING A BREAK.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.233
>> HEY, WHAT CAN I SAY?

04:26.233 --> 04:27.368
RUNNING, CLIMBING, JUMPING OFF

04:27.368 --> 04:28.336

04:28.336 --> 04:29.837
IT ALL MELLOWS ME OUT.

04:29.837 --> 04:30.971

04:30.971 --> 04:32.340

GIVE YOU A HEAD START.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.375

25:48.615 --> 25:49.616
LAUNDROMAT.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.687

25:54.687 --> 25:56.188
I'LL MOVE ON.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.624
JUST ONE THING.

25:57.624 --> 25:58.925
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GODMOTHER

25:58.925 --> 25:59.792
DUTY?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.828
BECAUSE MY NEW HOURS ARE CRAZY.

26:01.828 --> 26:03.663

26:03.663 --> 26:04.764
SAY THEY HAVEN'T BONDED.

26:04.764 --> 26:05.698
WOULD YOU TAKE THE EVENING SHIFT

26:05.698 --> 26:06.398
AND WATCH HER FOR A FEW HOURS

26:06.398 --> 26:07.266
A DAY?

26:07.266 --> 26:10.102
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.238
LITTLE BABY.

26:12.238 --> 26:15.241
AWW.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.142

26:16.142 --> 26:17.009
IN A SMALL?

26:17.009 --> 26:18.410
>> MM-MM. KEISHA?

26:18.410 --> 26:19.879

OH, YOU WANT ME--

26:25.051 --> 26:26.018

26:26.018 --> 26:27.186

26:27.186 --> 26:29.221
[chuckles] YEAH.

26:33.325 --> 26:34.794

26:40.266 --> 26:41.801
ANY CHANCE I CAN USE THAT SHOT

26:41.801 --> 26:42.702

26:42.702 --> 26:43.369

26:43.369 --> 26:44.236
>> OF COURSE.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.137
OF COURSE YOU CAN USE IT FOR

26:45.137 --> 26:46.005
YOUR WEBSITE.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.073
WHICH, I THINK YOUR WEBSITE'S

26:47.073 --> 26:48.908
GREAT, BUT IF YOU WERE TO SIGN

26:48.908 --> 26:49.976
WITH PRICE MANAGEMENT, WE WOULD

26:49.976 --> 26:51.243
TAKE YOUR ONLINE AWARENESS TO

26:51.243 --> 26:52.444
A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.913
>> YEAH, MY ONLINE PRESENCE IS

26:53.913 --> 26:55.247
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.883
I LIKE A WOMAN WHO KNOWS THE

26:56.883 --> 26:58.350
IMPORTANCE OF THE INTERNET.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.218

26:59.218 --> 27:00.152
WHY DON'T WE FLY YOU OUT TO

SO, I GOT SERGIO BACK ON

27:27.046 --> 27:28.014

27:43.863 --> 27:45.097

27:45.097 --> 27:46.032
>> OH, GOD.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.333

27:47.333 --> 27:50.036
STILL GONNA WIN, BUT IMPRESSIVE

27:50.036 --> 27:51.503
NONETHELESS.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.072

27:53.072 --> 27:54.306
YOU WERE NEVER THE TEACHER.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.374

I CAN BEAT YOU AT YOUR OWN GAME.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.248
>> HEY.

28:04.316 --> 28:05.918

28:06.986 --> 28:07.920
THAT I BLEW UP THE MEETING,

28:07.920 --> 28:09.155
OKAY?

28:09.155 --> 28:10.022
>> WHY?

28:10.022 --> 28:12.224
>> YOU KNOW WHY.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.292
[sighs] IT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T

28:13.292 --> 28:15.261
WANNA LOOK BAD IN FRONT OF YOUR

28:15.261 --> 28:16.562
FINE SELF.

YOU CAN'T LOOK BAD IN FRONT OF

28:21.000 --> 28:21.901
THIS.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.003
>> [chuckles]

28:24.003 --> 28:24.971
ALL RIGHT.

28:24.971 --> 28:25.637
IF I LET YOU SPLIT THE

28:25.637 --> 28:26.906
COMMISSION ON SERGIO WITH ME,

28:26.906 --> 28:28.074
THEN THAT'S IT.

28:28.074 --> 28:28.975
IT'S OVER.

28:28.975 --> 28:29.641
NO MORE COMPETING.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.043
NO MORE BACKSTABBING.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.244
NONE OF THESE STUPID GAMES,

28:32.244 --> 28:33.145
OKAY?

28:33.145 --> 28:34.480
WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.648
>> DEAL.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.584
BUT, WE HAVE TO KEEP THE

28:38.584 --> 28:40.052
OCCASIONAL NOONER STILL ON

28:40.052 --> 28:40.920

>> COME ON, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

28:44.390 --> 28:46.158
WHEN YOU RAGE, IT ONLY MAKES ME

28:46.158 --> 28:48.160
HORNIER.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.161
[upbeat music]

28:49.161 --> 28:55.334
*

28:55.334 --> 28:56.402
>> THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS

28:56.402 --> 28:58.037
WRONG WITH THIS SCENARIO.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.306
ONE, MY ASSISTANT IS HEARING

29:00.306 --> 29:02.041
THINGS THAT I DO NOT.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.475
>> FELICIA, WE CAN EXPLAIN.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.978
>> TWO, MY MANAGERS ARE SAYING

29:05.978 --> 29:07.246
THEY SIGNED CLIENTS WHEN THEY

29:07.246 --> 29:08.180
HAVEN'T, WHICH MAKES ME LOOK

29:08.180 --> 29:09.081
BAD.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.049
>> WELL, IT'S NOT ACTUALLY--

29:10.049 --> 29:12.118
>> THREE, TWO OF MY MANAGERS ARE

29:12.118 --> 29:14.353
TRYING TO STEAL THE SAME CLIENT.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.989
RECKLESS, SLOPPY, AND AGAIN,

29:16.989 --> 29:18.424
MAKES ME LOOK BAD.

29:18.424 --> 29:23.295
IN EVERY SCENARIO, I LOOK BAD.

29:23.295 --> 29:26.465
ONE OF YOU, EXPLAIN.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.500
>> WELL, I MAY HAVE MISSPOKEN

29:28.500 --> 29:30.536
WHEN I SAID I SIGNED SERGIO.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.671
BUT YOU KNOW THESE L.A. TYPES.

29:32.671 --> 29:34.406
BUT EVERYTHING IS FINE NOW.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.274
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.142
DAVID BROUGHT ME IN.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.309
I REACHED OUT, AND I--

29:37.309 --> 29:39.278
WE HAVE ANOTHER SHOT AT SERGIO.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.312
SO, I HAVE HIM ON THE BOOKS FOR

29:40.312 --> 29:41.313
NEXT WEEK.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.282
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S ALL THANKS TO

29:43.282 --> 29:44.583
HER.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.085
APRIL WAS THE CLOSER.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.520
SERGIO REQUIRED A MORE DELICATE

29:48.520 --> 29:49.688
TOUCH.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.323
WE'D HAVE LOST HIM OTHERWISE.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.025
>> NICELY DONE, APRIL.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.026
>> ME?

29:54.026 --> 29:54.994
>> MAKE A CHESS MOVE LIKE THAT

29:54.994 --> 29:57.229
EVERY DAY AND I MIGHT CONSIDER

29:57.229 --> 29:58.664
BEING IMPRESSED.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.585
THAT'S HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE IN

30:19.585 --> 30:21.220
A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.055
>> UH, WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DID

30:23.055 --> 30:24.090

30:24.090 --> 30:25.091

30:25.091 --> 30:26.292
I'M JUST TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT

30:26.292 --> 30:28.160
I'M CAPABLE OF GROWTH.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.461

UM, YOU KNOW, THE CONFERENCE

30:32.598 --> 30:33.499
ROOM IS EMPTY RIGHT NOW.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.400
>> OH, DAVID.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.267
>> WHAT?

30:35.267 --> 30:36.202
>> YOU GOTTA RUIN EVERY MOMENT,

30:36.202 --> 30:37.069
EVERY SINGLE ONE.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.004
>> WELL, IF I WALKED AWAY, THEN

30:38.004 --> 30:38.670
YOU WOULDN'T RETAIN THE

30:38.670 --> 30:39.638

WHEW.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.220
NOTE TO SELF, NEXT TIME ASK YOUR

30:54.220 --> 30:55.587
LOVELY OPPONENT HOW MUCH TENNIS

30:55.587 --> 30:56.588

30:56.588 --> 30:57.589
BEFORE CHALLENGING HER TO

30:57.589 --> 30:58.690
A ROUND.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.326
>> OH, DON'T FEEL BAD.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.061
LOSING IS A HUMBLING EXPERIENCE

31:02.061 --> 31:03.062
WE ALL NEED EVERY ONCE IN

31:03.062 --> 31:04.030
A WHILE.

31:04.030 --> 31:04.730
>> OH, I DON'T MIND BEING

31:04.730 --> 31:06.598
HUMBLED, ESPECIALLY BY SOMEONE

31:06.598 --> 31:08.200
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.535
>> OH, REALLY?

31:09.535 --> 31:10.736

31:49.508 --> 31:51.377
I LOVE HOW YOU TAKE CHARGE.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.778
YOU'RE A STRONG WOMAN.

31:52.778 --> 31:53.645

31:53.645 --> 31:54.646
IT'S NICE TO BE APPRECIATED FOR

31:54.646 --> 31:55.514
THAT.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.316
SO MEN CALL IT "BITCHINESS."

31:57.316 --> 31:58.350
>> WELL, I CAN ASSURE YOU I'M

31:58.350 --> 32:02.421
NOT ONE OF THOSE MEN.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.389
>> UM--

32:03.389 --> 32:04.590
>> OH, I'M SORRY, RAQUEL,

32:04.590 --> 32:05.457
I THOUGHT--

32:05.457 --> 32:06.325
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.293
I HAD A GREAT TIME.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.160
I JUST, UM--

32:08.160 --> 32:09.595
I SHOULD GET MY BEAUTY REST.

32:09.595 --> 32:10.596
>> I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET

32:10.596 --> 32:12.131
ANY MORE BEAUTIFUL, BUT I'LL

32:12.131 --> 32:13.232
LEAVE YOU TO IT.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.800
>> I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.036
>> IS TOMORROW NIGHT TOO SOON?

32:17.036 --> 32:18.770
>> HMM.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.506
I JUST HAPPEN NOT TO HAVE ANY

32:20.506 --> 32:21.607
PLANS.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.242
>> GREAT, TOMORROW NIGHT.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.476
>> OKAY.

32:24.476 --> 32:27.479
GOOD NIGHT, RAQUEL.

32:37.756 --> 32:40.626
>> GRIFFIN, WHAT'S UP?
