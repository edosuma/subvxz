00:11.120 --> 00:12.880
-Go Go: Whoa.
-That's right.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.000
Say hello to our brand new
hyper-conducting magnet.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.670
Hello.

00:17.670 --> 00:20.500
I'm very pleased
that you volunteered
for this project.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.500
Giant magnet?
I'm in.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.750
Everyone else on campus
seems to be more interested
in Halloween shenanigans.

00:26.750 --> 00:27.960
What?

00:27.960 --> 00:29.750
(ghostly moaning)

00:29.750 --> 00:31.210
Oh, no.

00:31.210 --> 00:36.210
(ghost voice)
Go Go, it is I,
your ancient ancestor,

00:36.210 --> 00:38.920
come back from the grave
to haunt you, wha-- whoa!

00:38.920 --> 00:40.710
Uhh!

00:40.710 --> 00:42.580
Cool giant magnet.

00:42.580 --> 00:45.750
Deal with this.
Ugh. Shenanigans.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.420
(sighs)

00:47.420 --> 00:48.960
Did I scare you?
Did I? Huh?

00:48.960 --> 00:50.460
Did I scare you?
Were you scared?
Come on...

00:50.460 --> 00:51.920
-You wish.
-You sure?

00:51.920 --> 00:53.500
Because your face
is emoting right now.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.500
Not fear. Anger.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.880
Know the difference.

01:00.540 --> 01:01.960
Ahhh... okay.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.500
I saw an eye twitch.
Seems fearish.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.040
You do this every year.
It's annoying.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.540
And it never works.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.540
Correction:
It hasn't worked yet!

01:09.540 --> 01:10.830
But I remain undeterred.

01:10.830 --> 01:13.620
Mark my words, Go Go,
I will frighten you.

01:13.620 --> 01:16.670
-There will be fear
in your future.
-(beeps)

01:16.670 --> 01:17.750
Aaah!

01:19.670 --> 01:21.040
And some bruising
in mine.

-Good try, though, Freddie.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.790
Guys, look.
I got this invitation
to this new haunted house

02:03.790 --> 02:05.620
-guaranteed to be terrifying!
-(evil laughter plays)

02:05.620 --> 02:07.790
What?
You hear that, Go Go?

02:07.790 --> 02:08.880
Guaranteed!

02:08.880 --> 02:10.170
Fred, I'm not
going to be scared

02:10.170 --> 02:11.880
of some cheesy haunted house.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.670
Methinks the lady
doth be afraid.

02:14.670 --> 02:16.880
-Fine. Let's go.
-Ohhh!

02:16.880 --> 02:18.540
Yes!
You see what
I did there?

02:18.540 --> 02:21.210
I used what's called
reverse psychology.

02:21.210 --> 02:22.960
Ooh!
Can we wear
Halloween costumes?

02:22.960 --> 02:24.790
Uh-- Yeah!

02:26.290 --> 02:29.790
Oh! Thought I was wearin'
my costume.

02:29.790 --> 02:31.290
Wasabi, you don't
have to come.

02:31.290 --> 02:33.670
What? (chuckles)
Why wouldn't I go?

02:36.670 --> 02:39.210
It's just--
you know, you're--
you're a little... jumpy.

02:39.210 --> 02:41.620
Jumpy?
I'm not jump-- (screams)

02:41.620 --> 02:43.040
Cockroach!
I saw a cockroach!

02:43.040 --> 02:46.620
Oh, wait.
No, it's just a blueberry.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.580
False alarm.

02:48.580 --> 02:51.960
You do know
what happens
at haunted houses, right?

02:54.580 --> 02:56.670
What I call "safe scares."

02:56.670 --> 02:59.830
I know they're not real,
therefore, I can enjoy
the feeling of fear

02:59.830 --> 03:02.960
-without
the actual fear. (screams)
-Okay, everybody's in.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.710
Let's costume up
and get goin',

03:04.710 --> 03:08.000
because someone is...
about to be scared!

03:09.830 --> 03:11.170
So, why a pineapple?

03:11.170 --> 03:12.920
It's the only fruit
that fit.

03:12.920 --> 03:17.880
Guys! Guys!
Did you see that?
I am a Halloween costume!

03:17.880 --> 03:20.750
Hiro:
We're all Halloween costumes.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.830
This is officially
the coolest day of my life!

Hello. I am a pirate.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.040
Arrrrgh.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.250
Have a lollipop.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.790
Welcome, welcome

House of Scares!

03:39.790 --> 03:41.920
(eerie laughter)

03:41.920 --> 03:44.710
Are you ready
to be... scared?

03:44.710 --> 03:46.750
-(wolf howling)
-Cheesy.

03:46.750 --> 03:47.960
How about you, little boy?

03:47.960 --> 03:49.750
Are you ready to be scared?

03:49.750 --> 03:51.210
I'm 14.

03:51.210 --> 03:55.170
Oh, well...
you are a little
on the diminutive side.

03:55.170 --> 03:57.790
-(eerie animal noise)
-Anyway, enter...

03:57.790 --> 04:00.210
if you dare!

04:00.210 --> 04:05.000
(wolf howling)

04:05.000 --> 04:06.920
Trick or treat.

04:06.920 --> 04:10.960
(eerie laughter)

04:10.960 --> 04:14.210
I know it's not real,
but I'd still like
an arm to clutch.

04:15.170 --> 04:19.000
(shrieking)

04:19.000 --> 04:20.960
Baymax:
This is not
anatomically correct.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.920
Um, I've never seen these
in a haunted house before.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.790
Have you been to a lot
of haunted houses?

04:30.790 --> 04:33.250
Yeah.
Tadashi would take me
to them all the time.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.000
Ooh, a vampire.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.080
Cool.
Check it out, guys!

04:39.040 --> 04:40.960
-(evil laughing)
-(chittering)

04:42.290 --> 04:44.710
Whoa! Freaky.

04:44.710 --> 04:46.080
Eh. It just blew air
in your face.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.380
It's a trick.

04:47.380 --> 04:50.290
I find your lack of fear
disturbing, to be honest.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.120
Everyone's afraid
of something.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.040
Come on, Go Go.
Something must freak you out.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.210
For me...
gonna go with heights.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.830
I think you all know mine.

04:59.830 --> 05:03.670
-Spiders?
-Uuugh...
leggy little demons.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.670
-(mummy shrieks)
-(Hiro/Fred/Wasabi/

05:06.670 --> 05:08.040
Baymax:
Your bandage is loose.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.170
This could increase
your risk of infection.

05:11.670 --> 05:13.000
I'm afraid of hippos.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.330
Hippos?
But I thought you loved
all things cute.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.080
Hippos aren't cute!

05:17.080 --> 05:18.920
Hippos are-- ooh...

05:22.250 --> 05:24.040
Anyway, Go Go,
there has to be something.

05:24.040 --> 05:28.000
Okay, fine.
I don't like... leprechauns.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.750
Leprechauns.

05:29.750 --> 05:32.000
Okay... kinda mundane.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.830
-Excuse me
if my darkest fear bores you--
-(mummy shrieks)

05:36.830 --> 05:37.880
I think we're done here.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.170
-(howling)
-Thanks for visiting.
Come again...

05:43.170 --> 05:46.290
if you da-aaare!

05:46.290 --> 05:47.670
Leave us a good review.

05:49.080 --> 05:53.000
You guys.
Noodle Burger Boy's
at the Krei Tech shipyard.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.330
(beeping)

06:07.830 --> 06:11.040
Fred:
Hey, Noodle Burger Boy!
Put that crate down!

06:11.040 --> 06:12.790
(giggles)
Okay, mister!

06:14.080 --> 06:15.750
No more running.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.210
Fred:
Whoa-ho!
Good news, guys.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.040
Noodle Burger Boy
is actually surren--

06:19.040 --> 06:21.080
Aahh!

06:21.080 --> 06:25.210
Noodle Burger Boy:
I'm gonna burn your buns!

06:25.210 --> 06:27.960
Fred:
Oww! I forgot
about the laser eyes!

06:29.000 --> 06:30.120
Hold on, Freddie!

06:34.000 --> 06:36.040
Uhh-- Hmm.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.120
Huh!
Thanks, Baymax.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.290
Baymax:
You are welcome.

06:40.290 --> 06:41.290
Where'd he go?

06:42.420 --> 06:43.790
I'm right behind him!

06:45.460 --> 06:48.120
Way too many pickles!

06:48.120 --> 06:49.250
Eahhhhhh!

06:52.120 --> 06:53.920
Ahh!

06:53.920 --> 06:55.040
I hate this guy!

06:55.040 --> 06:56.120
On it!

06:59.170 --> 07:01.170
Whoa!
Uuh! Uuh!

07:01.170 --> 07:03.880
I liked it better
when he could only shoot
ketchup and mustard!

07:05.120 --> 07:06.460
Whoa! Uuh!

07:08.170 --> 07:09.920
Okay, Baymax.
We need to slow him down.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.920
(beeping)

07:18.960 --> 07:23.000
Golly, mister.
That sure wasn't swell.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.380
It's time to reprogram you.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.290
You're coming with...

07:34.290 --> 07:35.170
Tadashi?

07:49.170 --> 07:51.040
Wait-- Wh-- Where'd he go?

07:51.040 --> 07:53.080
Baymax:
Noodle Burger Boy is gone.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.330
No. Not--

07:54.330 --> 07:56.170
Fred:
What happened?
How did he get away?

07:56.170 --> 07:57.380
Was it the laser eyes?

07:57.380 --> 08:00.170
Hey, there's no shame
in losing to laser eyes.

08:00.170 --> 08:02.330
No, I thought
I saw... something.

08:02.330 --> 08:03.460
I got distracted.

08:03.460 --> 08:04.920
Sorry, guys.

08:04.920 --> 08:05.960
Don't worry, Hiro.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.120
We'll get him next time.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.210
Yeah, Noodle Burger Boy
has an annoying habit

08:09.210 --> 08:11.250
of getting away,
but never staying away.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.540
I guess we'd better
break the bad news to Krei.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.500
I wonder what
was in that crate?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.420
Baymax:
Hiro...
is something wrong?

08:22.250 --> 08:23.500
No.
I'm coming.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.960
As the Third Law
of Thermodynamics states,

08:27.960 --> 08:29.920
the entropy
of a system approaches zero

08:29.920 --> 08:32.460
as its temperature
approaches absolute zero.

08:32.460 --> 08:35.000
Mr. Hamada!
Sit down!

08:35.000 --> 08:38.920
Uh, sorry, Professor Granville,
but I just-- I need to, uh, go!

08:40.790 --> 08:41.920
Hey! Wait!

08:43.120 --> 08:46.460
What? Okay.
I am officially losing it.

08:50.120 --> 08:55.040
(squeaking noise)

08:55.040 --> 08:57.580
Ucch, not again. Fred!

08:57.580 --> 08:59.380
(high-pitched voice)
Who's Fred?

08:59.380 --> 09:01.880
-I'm a wee leprechaun.
-This has to stop.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.380
Because you're scared?

09:03.380 --> 09:07.380
No, because I'm--
Actually... yeah.

09:07.380 --> 09:12.380
(mock scream)
I'm really scared.
You win.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.210
(normal voice)
That's fake fear, Go Go.

09:14.210 --> 09:16.040
I thought you said
you were afraid of leprechauns.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.040
I am, but this--
this is mostly sad.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.170
(gasps)
I spent hours
applying this beard.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.460
It's real hair!

09:23.460 --> 09:25.040
Now it's all sad.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
Fred... Halloween
is over.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.500
Oh, no.
Frederick Frederickson
does not give up.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.250
I will scare you, Go Go.
Just you wait.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.620
Just you wait!
(thuds)

09:34.620 --> 09:39.210
Eh-- Uh, no-- Uh,
that's not-- okay, and--
reverse, no--

09:39.210 --> 09:41.670
(chuckles)
Steering's a little tricky
on this thing.

09:41.670 --> 09:44.460
Uh, actually--
can you just turn away
as I attempt to exit

09:44.460 --> 09:46.580
with some sort of grace?

09:49.580 --> 09:52.420
Krei said all their crates
have built-in tracking devices.

09:52.420 --> 09:55.330
Wow. Krei actually
did something useful.

09:55.330 --> 09:57.460
-I'm shocked.
-According
to this,

09:57.460 --> 10:00.540
the stolen crate
should be right there.

10:00.540 --> 10:02.290
Wasabi on radio:
Does it happen to say
which floor?

10:02.290 --> 10:03.330
Uh, no.

10:04.460 --> 10:06.040
Do you see any construction?

10:06.040 --> 10:10.040
-Baymax:
Scanning...
-(beeps)

10:10.040 --> 10:12.670
The 23rd floor
is under construction.

10:12.670 --> 10:15.000
Freddie:
Okay, I'll bet that's
where Noodle Burger Boy is.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.420
Villains love exposed pipes,
beams, and plastic tarps.

10:18.420 --> 10:19.960
(tapping on keyboard)

10:21.750 --> 10:23.290
Good call, Fred.

10:24.710 --> 10:25.920
Honey Lemon:
What's he doing?

10:25.920 --> 10:28.290
My guess is something bad.
Or, you know what?

10:28.290 --> 10:30.080
He could just be
catchin' up on emails.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.040
But... probably somethin' bad.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.540
Which is why we need
to catch this dumb burger head
once and for all.

10:35.540 --> 10:38.290
Don't forget, laser eyes.

10:39.620 --> 10:44.040
(beeping)

10:44.040 --> 10:46.670
Forget laser eyes,
we've got bigger problems!

10:46.670 --> 10:48.750
-Guess we know
what was in the crate.
-Buddy guards!

10:48.750 --> 10:50.710
Howdy and hello!

10:50.710 --> 10:53.960
Have you met my
little dumplings?

10:53.960 --> 10:56.000
"Little dumplings"? Really?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.540
Dumplings... attack!

10:58.540 --> 11:00.620
Wasabi:
Okay, new biggest fear,
flying dumplings with eyes.

11:00.620 --> 11:02.620
(grunting)

11:03.620 --> 11:05.210
Aahhh!

11:05.210 --> 11:07.210
Oh no!
You already
ruined Noodle Burgers.

11:07.210 --> 11:09.000
You are not ruining dumplings
for me, too!

11:11.670 --> 11:13.380
(grunt)

11:13.380 --> 11:15.040
(grunt)

11:15.040 --> 11:17.620
Uh-yah! That
is a big shipping container!

11:25.120 --> 11:27.620
They're all networked
to Noodle Burger Boy.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.330
(grunting)

11:30.330 --> 11:31.750
No kidding!

11:31.750 --> 11:33.290
Noodle Burger Boy:
Golly, little dumplings.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.670
I'm really getting steamed.

11:35.670 --> 11:39.170
Let's see how they like
invisible-style!

11:47.460 --> 11:48.830
This is not fair!

11:52.040 --> 11:53.080
(grunt)

11:53.080 --> 11:54.830
(laughs)

11:54.830 --> 11:56.420
I can get us out of here.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.830
(grunting)

12:03.040 --> 12:04.620
Mmm...

12:04.620 --> 12:06.580
Hiro!
We're kinda stuck!

12:15.330 --> 12:17.790
(Hiro grunting)

12:17.790 --> 12:21.080
Huh... never thought
I'd see Hiro wrestle
a flying dumpling.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.420
Seems like more
of a Go Go thing.

12:22.420 --> 12:25.170
(grunting)

12:25.170 --> 12:27.080
There!

12:27.080 --> 12:28.420
Should've thought that through.

12:28.420 --> 12:29.500
Uhh!

12:29.500 --> 12:30.540
Baymax:
Hiro!

12:32.000 --> 12:33.120
Oh, no.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.620
Baymax!

12:34.620 --> 12:36.380
(Noodle Burger Boy laughs)

12:36.380 --> 12:40.000
Golly, mister,
it looks like your friend
got pan fried!

12:40.000 --> 12:41.580
Time to go,
little dumplings!

12:41.580 --> 12:44.710
Follow papa.
Remember the buddy system!

12:44.710 --> 12:48.880
♪ Yeah, ho, hee hee!
Yeah, ho, hee hee! ♪

12:48.880 --> 12:50.170
So weird.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.880
Fred: Great!
Another food group
off the list.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.750
Dumplings are not
a food group.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.040
Fred:
Not anymore!

12:56.040 --> 12:57.750
(grunts)
Hold on...

12:57.750 --> 12:59.580
I think I got it!

12:59.580 --> 13:01.210
Baymax!
You okay?

13:01.210 --> 13:04.170
I am badly damaged.
I will now shut down.

13:04.170 --> 13:06.920
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll fix you.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.000
Hey, uh... how's that?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.830
Baymax:
I am unable
to move my arms.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.380
-Also, my legs.
-So, not great.

13:20.380 --> 13:22.540
Just, let me make
a few more adjustments.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.460
Tadashi?

13:31.460 --> 13:34.080
Wait. Okay, Baymax, did--
did you see that?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.000
It was Tadashi,
he was right there.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.170
Hiro, I am sorry,
but Tadashi could not
have been here.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.080
-Tadashi is--
-I know.

13:43.380 --> 13:46.880
Missing a loved one
can be difficult.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.210
Wait here.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.080
(cable car bell rings)

14:26.420 --> 14:28.420
The haunted house?

14:29.670 --> 14:30.880
(door squeaking)

14:32.830 --> 14:34.420
Hello?

14:34.420 --> 14:36.120
-(door slams shut)
-Aaah!

14:39.920 --> 14:43.080
Come on!
I know someone's here,
I just saw--

14:45.620 --> 14:47.000
Hey, little brother.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.250
Tadashi, no!

15:01.250 --> 15:03.500
This is impossible!

15:03.500 --> 15:05.580
Come on,
nothing's impossible, Hiro.

15:05.580 --> 15:07.210
How?
How are you here?

15:07.210 --> 15:09.170
Well, I could ask you
the same thing.

15:09.170 --> 15:11.750
How are you here,
when I know for a fact,

15:11.750 --> 15:13.670
that Aunt Cass
would not let you out
this late.

15:13.670 --> 15:16.500
I-- I was working in the garage,
and then I saw you,

15:16.500 --> 15:18.080
-and I just--
-Just snuck out?

15:18.080 --> 15:19.290
I didn't sneak.

15:19.290 --> 15:20.880
I... left.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.830
Without telling her
where you were going?

15:22.830 --> 15:24.330
It's good to see
nothing's changed.

15:24.330 --> 15:26.330
Still the same old Hiro.

15:27.830 --> 15:29.790
(frightened sound)

15:29.790 --> 15:32.670
This is crazy.
This is just crazy!

16:21.880 --> 16:25.000
-She thinks I need limits.
-Limits?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.380
Limits'll just slow you down.

16:26.380 --> 16:27.920
Uh, what do you mean?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.330
Hiro, you can do anything.
Be anything.

16:30.330 --> 16:32.460

Don't waste it.

16:32.460 --> 16:37.290

Aunt Cass is doing great.
But I-- I-- I can tell
she misses you.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.620
I-- I miss you, too.

18:16.580 --> 18:20.460
And Baymax--
well, Baymax
is awesome.

18:20.460 --> 18:23.000
Of course, he's a little broken
right now, but-- but I can
fix him.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.880
You know, Hiro, you shouldn't
waste your talents
fixing my old work.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.790
What's wrong?

18:31.790 --> 18:34.750
"Don't fix Baymax"?
"You don't need limits"?

18:34.750 --> 18:38.170
Tadashi would never
say those things.

18:38.170 --> 18:40.250
I just want

19:11.710 --> 19:13.620
Who are you really?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.170
Why are you doing this?

19:15.170 --> 19:16.710
Doing what?

19:16.710 --> 19:18.710
Pretending
to be my brother.
Messing with me.

19:18.710 --> 19:22.290
I don't know
what you're talking about...
little brother.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.880
It-- It's this place.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.620

19:53.880 --> 19:56.080
Guys, they're contacts.
Take them out!

19:56.080 --> 19:57.330
Huh?

19:57.330 --> 20:00.920
I don't like touchin'
my eyes!

20:00.920 --> 20:03.330
I'm doin' it!
I'm doin' it,
but I don't like doin' it!

20:03.330 --> 20:05.880
Hey, Wasabi!
It's okay, buddy,
it's not real!

20:05.880 --> 20:09.330
I don't know... it feels
pretty real to me!

20:09.330 --> 20:11.620
Wasabi, these are
safe scares!

20:11.620 --> 20:13.830
Just take the contacts
out of your eyes!

20:13.830 --> 20:16.170
(gasps)
But I don't wear contacts!

20:16.170 --> 20:17.920

20:39.000 --> 20:39.830
Yeah.

20:39.830 --> 20:42.710
Are you serious?
Oh-- Go Go was scared,

20:42.710 --> 20:44.880
and I didn't even
get to appreciate it?

20:44.880 --> 20:47.750
Guys, Noodle Burger Boy
took the magnet.

20:49.210 --> 20:52.710
Why would Noodle Burger Boy
want a high-powered magnet?

20:52.710 --> 20:54.670
(crickets chirping)

20:54.670 --> 20:56.830
Wait, you saw Tadashi?

20:56.830 --> 20:58.920
Not only that,
I talked to him.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.750
It was so... real.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.040
I'm so sorry, Hiro.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.920
Ugh, that is crossing a line.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.670
Seriously.
What is this Obake guy's deal?

21:07.670 --> 21:09.710
And how could he know
so much about Tadashi?

21:21.120 --> 21:22.750
Noodle Burger Boy:
Order up, mister!

21:22.750 --> 21:25.920
Obake:
Good. Very good.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.830
Yes...

21:27.830 --> 21:30.380
this will do nicely.
