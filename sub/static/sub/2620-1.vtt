03:42.184 --> 03:45.352
Speak up, boy, 'fore I lay into you.

03:46.955 --> 03:50.793
There's three of 'em. Two is men.

03:50.993 --> 03:52.689
Any inside?

03:53.428 --> 03:55.729
Just an old white woman.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.567
You sure, now?

04:02.637 --> 04:04.805
But she got a shotgun.

04:05.807 --> 04:07.402
Well,

04:08.143 --> 04:11.344
you boys try not to piss yourselves.

04:23.036 --> 04:24.797
Watch it! Watch it!

04:26.595 --> 04:28.462
Okay, let's go!

04:35.271 --> 04:37.707
Get up! Come on!

04:38.007 --> 04:39.309
Come on.

04:40.620 --> 04:41.609
Come on.

04:41.710 --> 04:44.277
That's money is what that is.

05:39.204 --> 05:44.070
That nigger's worth $600, and you ain't.

05:45.306 --> 05:47.510
You owe that boy an apology.

05:47.610 --> 05:50.246
I'm sorry, Burrell, for...

05:50.346 --> 05:52.209
Don't tell me.

05:57.953 --> 05:59.708
I apologize.

06:04.092 --> 06:07.861
This lost property is to be
protected until returned.

07:12.994 --> 07:14.653
I got three rolled.

07:14.753 --> 07:17.798
Pay me first.
Last time you ain't pay me.

07:34.382 --> 07:36.184
Make sure your uncle shares that.

07:53.368 --> 07:55.235
You ain't thank me.

07:56.871 --> 07:58.772
Thank you, Marcus.

07:59.908 --> 08:02.645
Ain't no need to be countin', boy.

08:03.045 --> 08:05.915
Don't I provide when no one else did?

08:06.415 --> 08:08.914
You welcome to set out on your own.

08:13.755 --> 08:16.158
Go on now. Feed them niggers.

08:16.258 --> 08:18.325
It's your turn.

08:41.249 --> 08:42.450
Y'all thirsty?

08:58.233 --> 09:00.000
I got something for you.

09:01.569 --> 09:04.905
Name of the man
you're looking for is Nate.

09:07.943 --> 09:11.511
He's diggin' graves for the Federals
near Petersburg.

09:12.947 --> 09:15.715
About three,
four nights from here by foot.

09:17.018 --> 09:20.153
I don't reckon I'd be welcome
anyplace near.

09:22.557 --> 09:26.292
And this nigger just gonna happily
walk hisself back south?

09:28.296 --> 09:32.499
Well, they buried his brother not
two months ago down in Leesville.

09:33.168 --> 09:35.535
News ain't made it up there.

09:37.872 --> 09:39.806
You'll think of somethin'.

09:48.149 --> 09:50.784
How 'bout you give me 50 for the boy?

09:52.053 --> 09:54.290
In case I don't make it back.

09:54.390 --> 09:56.108
Even if I do,

09:57.223 --> 09:59.094
he'd be yours.

09:59.194 --> 10:01.797
He can cook, tend horses.

10:01.897 --> 10:04.166
Should keep the boy.

10:04.266 --> 10:05.902
Might need him.

10:06.302 --> 10:10.203
Besides, you do this right, you're gonna
need help carryin' all that gold.

10:26.721 --> 10:29.689
There's a lot of country
between here and there.

10:32.027 --> 10:35.462
And to the north
and south of either place.

10:37.165 --> 10:39.097
And out west.

10:41.669 --> 10:47.340
If a man don't want to be found,
there's many places he can go.

10:49.877 --> 10:51.979
Where you can go.

10:58.186 --> 11:00.120
Don't matter.

11:03.124 --> 11:07.063
If you don't bring this nigger back
exactly how I say,

11:07.163 --> 11:09.798
I'll find you and put you in the ground,

11:09.898 --> 11:12.201
along with the boy...

11:12.301 --> 11:14.953
and everybody else you ever knew.

12:07.021 --> 12:08.522
Wake up.

12:31.012 --> 12:33.382
Why we goin' so far
for just one runaway?

12:33.582 --> 12:36.285
Can leave you here if you don't like it.

12:36.385 --> 12:38.552
Makes no difference.

12:42.657 --> 12:44.858
- Why can't we just...
- Money's why.

12:46.461 --> 12:49.596
And this one's worth more than
them other three put together.

12:53.735 --> 12:55.435
I'll take that.

13:19.594 --> 13:23.899
- Who you think used to live here?
- Now just keep quiet and listen.

13:23.999 --> 13:26.967
When we get back with him,
we stay the last night...

13:34.242 --> 13:37.746
When we get back with him,
we stay the last night here.

13:37.846 --> 13:40.816
When you get up, you go get Burrell
'fore that nigger wakes.

13:41.416 --> 13:45.360
They not a mile that way. And I don't want
no talkin' about how you been here before

13:45.460 --> 13:48.422
or none of that shit. Understand?

13:49.223 --> 13:51.524
Good. Go on.

14:02.470 --> 14:05.259
Get down on the ground. Lay down there.

14:05.459 --> 14:06.608
What?

14:06.709 --> 14:09.643
Boy, get down on the ground
like you sleepin'.

14:13.581 --> 14:15.815
Now get up and get out that door.

14:21.589 --> 14:23.923
So I can't hear ya.

14:45.179 --> 14:46.585
Again.

14:51.386 --> 14:55.090
You ain't asleep.
So you hear everything.

14:55.190 --> 14:56.923
Goddamn it, boy.

14:59.594 --> 15:00.994
Again.

15:44.138 --> 15:47.774
If he's got a knife or something, we gotta
take it from him while he's sleepin'.

15:48.743 --> 15:50.785
This ain't like sneakin' out the
other night when they was scared

15:50.885 --> 15:53.280
and they ain't had nowhere else to go.

15:54.215 --> 15:56.550
This one's somethin' else.

17:58.272 --> 18:00.006
Go on, now.

18:10.184 --> 18:12.251
Your name Nate, sir?

18:18.393 --> 18:20.560
I'm Will from...

18:23.230 --> 18:25.300
That's my Uncle Marcus.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.450
From around Leesville.

18:30.671 --> 18:33.840
We come on account
of your brother, Samuel?

18:34.609 --> 18:36.411
He got consumption.

18:36.511 --> 18:38.680
He ain't well.

18:38.780 --> 18:40.975
Say he ain't gonna last long.

18:41.916 --> 18:44.286
Can't go back down there.

18:45.086 --> 18:47.044
Your brother said...

18:47.922 --> 18:50.726
he wants to see you before he goes.

18:50.826 --> 18:53.760
- He ask us to tell you that.
- How'd you find me?

18:55.296 --> 18:57.831
Your brother heard you was here.
I don't know how.

18:58.766 --> 19:01.003
When was this?

19:01.103 --> 19:02.604
Three days back.

19:02.704 --> 19:06.508
And you just took it upon yourself
to deliver the word?

19:06.708 --> 19:11.711
His master, Pritchards, tasked us
with it, and we'll be paid.

19:12.747 --> 19:15.815
Say he ain't got long.
He just wants to see you.

19:24.392 --> 19:26.646
Should we tell your brother somethin'?

19:27.862 --> 19:30.029
'Bout why you ain't come back for him?

19:39.473 --> 19:41.474
Y'all from Leesville?

19:43.677 --> 19:45.411
He in a bad way?

19:48.282 --> 19:50.318
I'll see to it when I can.

19:50.618 --> 19:53.021
We should all head back together.

19:53.221 --> 19:55.558
Can we journey back with you?

19:56.258 --> 19:58.927
- The two of you make it up here on your own?
- Yes, sir.

19:59.027 --> 20:03.296
Then... I figure you can make it
back down on your own too.

20:04.031 --> 20:06.068
Well, we won't be a bother.

20:06.268 --> 20:09.802
Besides, we came all this way for you.

20:11.405 --> 20:13.539
We'll leave before sunup.

20:14.308 --> 20:16.542
And we stay off the roads.

20:17.845 --> 20:20.146
I can't be liable for foolish children.

20:22.416 --> 20:24.150
Now, go on.

20:43.871 --> 20:46.274
You want my advice, we'll make it there
in three days if we head up...

20:46.374 --> 20:48.141
Don't want your advice.

20:49.910 --> 20:53.112
Well, you need it, ornery bastard.

20:55.216 --> 20:57.478
You headed that way?

20:58.686 --> 21:00.086
Yeah.

21:01.255 --> 21:03.556
You welcome to take any path you want.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.104
Marcus know the best way.

21:15.604 --> 21:17.637
You ain't got nothin' to worry about.

21:30.451 --> 21:32.518
You ever seen a cannon shoot off?

21:33.654 --> 21:35.791
I've heard 'em lots.

21:35.891 --> 21:37.957
Just never seen 'em.

21:43.397 --> 21:45.037
- Why do you think...
- Didn't your mama ever teach you to shut up

21:45.137 --> 21:46.985
and listen sometime?

21:47.968 --> 21:49.936
I never knew my mama.

21:54.074 --> 21:56.342
So how long has it been
since you run up north?

21:59.246 --> 22:01.347
I ain't a runaway.

22:25.472 --> 22:27.807
That's too much for you
to be carryin', boy.

22:29.643 --> 22:31.379
My father gave me that.

22:31.779 --> 22:33.982
I don't give a damn who gave it to you.

22:34.582 --> 22:37.316
I ain't spending it till I see him next.

22:46.226 --> 22:49.331
Yeah, keep on rubbin' that thing.

22:49.431 --> 22:51.519
Shine it up.

22:52.134 --> 22:56.037
You rub that thing half as good as you
was rubbin' your johnson last night,

22:56.337 --> 22:58.473
it'll shine right up.

22:58.573 --> 23:01.443
- Might even blind a man.
- He lyin'.

23:01.843 --> 23:05.747
Hell, he could rub the eagle right off
the back of that coin till it's smooth.

23:06.447 --> 23:10.450
- Least he's good at one thing.
- I was a professional at his age.

24:16.016 --> 24:18.050
They's stuck on your back.

24:27.327 --> 24:29.462
Why they stick like that?

24:31.165 --> 24:33.201
Don't serve no purpose.

24:33.501 --> 24:35.471
It's a seed.

24:35.871 --> 24:38.904
That way they travel further
than they could on their own.

24:44.211 --> 24:46.679
- But why do they...
- You wearin' me out, boy.

24:47.147 --> 24:48.889
Well, I just...

24:52.320 --> 24:53.387
Hear that?

24:57.524 --> 25:00.394
- No. What's it sound like?
- Keep listenin'.

25:00.494 --> 25:02.349
Very quiet.

25:09.536 --> 25:11.437
Was that it?

25:25.352 --> 25:28.423
Why we takin' him back to Burrell
if he ain't a runaway?

25:28.523 --> 25:29.756
What?

25:31.758 --> 25:35.831
He owe Burrell money. And they might
have to rough him up to get it,

25:35.931 --> 25:38.174
so stop getting all friendly with him.

25:41.068 --> 25:45.306
Maybe he'll just pay up
so they won't have to.

25:45.406 --> 25:47.540
He made his choices.

25:50.310 --> 25:52.878
And don't forget
what we stand to collect.

25:54.181 --> 25:58.151
Tonight, you try and sneak out in
the night. See how good he sleeps.

26:18.005 --> 26:20.439
Boy, you best get up and get some more.

26:38.892 --> 26:41.293
We over here crackin' teeth,

26:42.396 --> 26:44.330
and this nigger eatin' pork?

26:49.303 --> 26:51.671
You know, a man can share.

26:53.173 --> 26:54.251
You're right.

27:32.513 --> 27:35.114
What's it like diggin' for the Federals?

27:38.852 --> 27:42.321
It don't seem no different from diggin'
for a master down south.

27:43.023 --> 27:45.891
You seen me ask any man's
permission to leave?

27:47.427 --> 27:49.862
You work hard, you're your own man.

27:51.498 --> 27:54.833
I don't need no one
and don't look out for no one.

27:58.739 --> 28:01.140
Marcus and I look out for each other...

28:02.809 --> 28:05.122
ever since the army
burned down the master's farm.

28:05.980 --> 28:08.748
Doin' what it takes to get by.

28:10.751 --> 28:13.019
We's family, you know?

28:15.222 --> 28:18.190
I knew my ma for about two hours,

28:18.925 --> 28:21.527
and my father was a sumbitch.

28:23.563 --> 28:27.569
Father went north two years back,
but he's comin' back for me.

28:27.669 --> 28:29.938
Boy, that's bullshit and you know it.

28:30.038 --> 28:34.276
Comin' back down south for you
is the last thing on the man's mind.

28:35.076 --> 28:38.000
Keep quiet and let a nigger sleep.

30:04.931 --> 30:06.932
Where you goin'?

30:12.038 --> 30:14.506
I got to piss.

30:16.310 --> 30:18.380
Then go right there.

30:18.480 --> 30:22.781
You ain't got to spend 10 minutes standin' up
and then walk a mile out in the woods.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.042
Well?

30:32.692 --> 30:35.096
Well, I can't with you watchin'.

30:35.696 --> 30:38.597
Oh, shit, boy.

31:34.254 --> 31:36.023
Hold on now.

31:36.623 --> 31:38.593
Where you goin'?

31:38.693 --> 31:41.863
- Just hold up now.
- You stole some of my salt pork.

31:41.963 --> 31:44.999
- I'll make my own way from here on.
- Man, I ain't eat your food.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.769
I knowed you was a thief.

31:48.169 --> 31:50.728
You don't know a goddamn thing.

31:51.538 --> 31:54.074
What, you think I stole that shit?

31:54.174 --> 31:56.010
Why?

31:56.110 --> 31:58.497
You smell it on my breath?

32:07.120 --> 32:08.754
You smell it on my breath?

32:12.692 --> 32:16.128
Come on, nigger. Teach me a lesson.

32:16.796 --> 32:18.767
Just wait up now.

32:19.267 --> 32:21.567
Come on, boy. Grab the shit. Let's go.

33:24.498 --> 33:28.433
Take water if you need.
The rest belongs to their kinfolk.

33:32.072 --> 33:34.442
Damn, if you ain't an uppity nigger.

33:35.142 --> 33:38.179
Slave for the Union
is still just a slave.

33:38.279 --> 33:41.749
- He ain't like other men I seen.
- Yeah.

33:41.849 --> 33:45.653
He's worth more. And don't you forget.

33:46.153 --> 33:47.786
What if it was you?

33:48.588 --> 33:50.304
Well, it ain't.

33:55.862 --> 33:57.739
Look at me, boy.

33:58.865 --> 34:00.624
Look at me.

34:03.370 --> 34:06.238
You wanna go back
to sellin' tobacco for pennies?

34:07.741 --> 34:12.610
Now, you can live hand to mouth
for the rest of your life.

34:13.379 --> 34:14.880
Or...

34:16.216 --> 34:18.083
you can make some money.

34:19.786 --> 34:22.621
Maybe even enough to find your daddy.

35:29.022 --> 35:31.292
Get down, boy.

35:31.392 --> 35:34.589
When I was your age, I was climbin'
like that and broke a leg.

35:36.462 --> 35:38.130
How's it now?

35:39.065 --> 35:41.035
It's fine now.

35:41.135 --> 35:45.203
Well, if it ain't a problem,
I'll keep climbin'.

35:56.049 --> 35:58.483
I always make you mad, don't I?

36:02.756 --> 36:04.358
Can you throw that?

36:04.758 --> 36:06.327
Show me how.

36:06.427 --> 36:08.478
Go on. Climb that tree.

36:16.102 --> 36:18.539
Got any other family?

36:18.639 --> 36:20.639
Besides your brother?

36:23.209 --> 36:24.858
Nothin'?

36:26.513 --> 36:28.629
I had a woman...

36:29.129 --> 36:31.053
not too far from here.

36:32.285 --> 36:35.387
Wasn't no words spoken over us,
but she was my woman.

36:36.790 --> 36:38.657
No children?

36:41.995 --> 36:44.029
We had a child.

36:45.231 --> 36:47.595
Probably be a little older than you,

36:48.095 --> 36:49.870
but he ain't make it.

36:52.372 --> 36:54.339
You don't see her no more?

36:55.041 --> 36:57.144
Best this way.

36:57.244 --> 36:59.392
Got nothin' weighin' me down.

37:01.915 --> 37:04.316
- So what was her name?
- Rachel.

37:05.218 --> 37:07.753
There's a lot of Rachels out there.

37:11.225 --> 37:14.592
Lord, I known a lot of Rachels
in my day.

37:17.263 --> 37:18.924
Where you say your Rachel's from?

37:21.900 --> 37:23.771
We rested long enough.

37:24.871 --> 37:29.073
I'll fill this up, then we'll keep on.

37:29.309 --> 37:31.209
I'll fill it for you.

37:53.299 --> 37:55.267
This'll do for tonight.

38:00.940 --> 38:02.843
Come on. Let's get some wood.

38:02.943 --> 38:04.545
No fire tonight.

38:04.645 --> 38:07.579
We're too far from Union lines
and don't need the attention.

38:08.481 --> 38:10.418
Well, I'm makin' a fire.

38:10.518 --> 38:13.169
So if you don't like it, you can
freeze your ass on down the way.

38:18.290 --> 38:19.760
Get up.

38:19.860 --> 38:22.995
Let him be. The boy's feet ain't good.

38:26.532 --> 38:28.433
Come on now, boy.

38:35.074 --> 38:37.709
You gonna have to be
your own man someday.

38:44.651 --> 38:46.985
Maybe we can do
something nice for him...

38:49.455 --> 38:51.356
'fore we turn him in.

38:55.495 --> 38:59.097
You think you good, but you ain't.

38:59.799 --> 39:01.487
You'd do the same thing if you was me.

39:10.944 --> 39:12.780
Can't we just...

39:13.947 --> 39:15.800
ask him for the money he owe Burrell?

39:20.753 --> 39:22.389
Goddamn it, boy.

39:23.189 --> 39:26.767
Burrell don't want money from him.
Nate done killed a man,

39:26.867 --> 39:29.727
and Burrell's gonna kill him
to get the bounty.

39:32.565 --> 39:37.104
Now, I'd do it for the money myself,
but Burrell will kill me and you both...

39:37.204 --> 39:40.004
if we don't deliver him
exactly how he say.

39:40.773 --> 39:42.901
Stop talkin' to that old man
'fore he figure us out

39:43.001 --> 39:46.378
and we got to kill him and drag
his dead ass all the way back.

39:52.385 --> 39:56.590
This ain't just about the money.
It's about your life.

39:56.690 --> 39:59.557
Nate's a dead man
and can't nobody help him.

40:29.822 --> 40:31.697
What is it, boy?

40:35.128 --> 40:36.995
You ain't sleepin'?

40:41.601 --> 40:44.002
I can't always sleep neither.

40:55.113 --> 40:57.221
All of a sudden you quiet?

41:43.997 --> 41:45.768
Where's Nate?

42:01.347 --> 42:03.148
Get the boy!

43:14.954 --> 43:16.957
All right. All right.

43:17.057 --> 43:19.257
- Get down.
- All right.

43:56.495 --> 43:58.330
All right, come on.

45:02.061 --> 45:04.348
All right, now, let's have a look.

45:05.497 --> 45:07.231
Come on.

45:07.433 --> 45:09.400
We'll get you right.

45:19.745 --> 45:21.949
This just so we ain't slowed down.

45:22.049 --> 45:24.785
You do everything I say
or I'll leave you.

45:24.885 --> 45:26.584
Understand?

45:28.721 --> 45:30.991
Come on. You're all right.

45:31.291 --> 45:33.675
We only got two or three more nights.

45:47.106 --> 45:49.784
There used to be
some freedmen livin' out here.

47:20.666 --> 47:23.103
We appreciate you havin' us
on such a night.

47:23.203 --> 47:25.637
Your son look hungrier than you are.

47:46.859 --> 47:49.427
Me and your uncle
didn't always get on well,

47:51.464 --> 47:54.935
but it was kind of him to come
tell me the word about my brother.

47:55.735 --> 47:58.169
He died doin' a good thing.

48:02.541 --> 48:05.476
When the soldiers came,
he tried to save himself.

48:09.515 --> 48:11.850
Why'd you come back for me?

48:45.618 --> 48:47.519
What's your name?

48:48.487 --> 48:50.088
Will.

48:51.790 --> 48:53.301
William.

48:54.426 --> 48:56.407
William sounds old.

48:57.162 --> 49:00.531
They call me Abby, instead of Abigail.

49:07.172 --> 49:10.962
Who's that man you with? He kin to you?

49:11.945 --> 49:13.580
Just a man.

49:13.880 --> 49:15.813
Just a man?

49:21.687 --> 49:23.855
That's cold, boy!

49:24.790 --> 49:26.257
You stayin' here?

49:27.860 --> 49:29.427
You should stay here.

49:35.968 --> 49:37.737
How come?

49:37.837 --> 49:39.771
Where you goin'?

49:42.508 --> 49:44.909
There ain't much other children
round here.

49:46.145 --> 49:48.048
I ain't children.

49:50.749 --> 49:52.315
Ready?

50:39.198 --> 50:41.432
We gettin' closer now.

50:42.334 --> 50:44.902
I can't be seen in these parts.

51:09.528 --> 51:11.196
All right.

51:11.864 --> 51:15.702
When you throw it,
hold your arm straight out.

51:15.802 --> 51:17.838
Let's see how you do.

51:18.338 --> 51:19.737
Come on.

51:20.239 --> 51:21.839
Come on.

51:23.776 --> 51:25.345
You used a hammer?

51:25.645 --> 51:27.881
Hold it like that.

51:27.981 --> 51:29.580
Lower.

51:33.786 --> 51:36.022
What's wrong with you, boy?

51:36.622 --> 51:38.416
Come on, now.

51:39.324 --> 51:42.160
Pick a tree, not too far.

51:43.996 --> 51:48.499
Boy, what's wrong with you?
Come on. Pick a tree.

51:54.173 --> 51:57.141
Marcus didn't steal your salt pork.

51:57.576 --> 51:59.480
It was me.

52:10.556 --> 52:13.558
I'd have give it to you
had you asked me.

52:20.132 --> 52:21.901
Nate.

52:22.001 --> 52:23.335
I...

52:25.037 --> 52:26.738
I got to tell you...

52:33.479 --> 52:36.216
If they see us, you just run.

52:36.316 --> 52:38.149
Don't look back.

53:46.151 --> 53:48.852
You got any other family
round Leesville?

53:51.990 --> 53:54.576
When we get back, what you gonna do?

53:57.129 --> 53:59.800
I do odd jobs for a white man.

54:00.500 --> 54:03.837
I'm savin' up to go look for
my pa if he ain't back soon.

54:04.137 --> 54:06.139
What kind of jobs?

54:06.939 --> 54:09.273
Different things
up and down the Nottoway.

54:11.176 --> 54:13.246
I thought you said
you was from Leesville.

54:13.346 --> 54:14.846
No.

54:16.314 --> 54:17.912
I am.

54:19.117 --> 54:21.619
It ain't too far from there.

54:43.575 --> 54:45.376
I saw you talkin'
to that girl back there.

54:46.812 --> 54:49.716
- You ever had a girl of your own?
- No.

54:49.916 --> 54:51.451
Don't.

54:51.651 --> 54:53.396
They trouble.

54:54.820 --> 54:58.088
- Not all of 'em.
- Yeah. All of 'em.

55:01.260 --> 55:03.194
But they worth it.

56:49.334 --> 56:51.037
I'm bringin' him.

56:51.637 --> 56:55.106
- I done like Burrell said.
- We ain't ridin' with Burrell no more.

56:59.177 --> 57:02.146
Son of a bitch killed Hayden
two days ago.

57:05.217 --> 57:06.918
He ain't right.

57:15.059 --> 57:17.127
We found your boy.

57:29.207 --> 57:31.442
Where you two headed?

57:32.678 --> 57:35.615
I got a brother sick down in Leesville.

57:35.715 --> 57:38.148
We headed down that way.

57:39.017 --> 57:40.584
Ain't we?

57:42.620 --> 57:45.355
Y'all look to be in a sorry state.

57:47.059 --> 57:50.594
I ain't like to see men like that...
niggers or not.

57:53.665 --> 57:56.703
Might as well make our way together.

57:57.303 --> 58:00.837
That's kind, but we'll be all right.

58:01.306 --> 58:04.261
We'll just keep alongside,
if it suits you.

58:06.979 --> 58:10.047
I don't give a damn if it suits him.

58:23.329 --> 58:24.684
Stop!

58:36.674 --> 58:38.809
I warned him.

59:17.216 --> 59:19.953
We only got one more night after this.

59:20.253 --> 59:23.087
So I guess we'll just make do tomorrow.

59:44.676 --> 59:46.977
You saved me back there.

59:49.047 --> 59:51.250
I was savin' myself.

59:57.989 --> 01:00:00.290
You had a woman near here?

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.964
Yeah.

01:00:06.999 --> 01:00:09.967
Y'all ain't never had
another child together?

01:00:10.669 --> 01:00:13.203
It ain't always that simple.

01:00:15.874 --> 01:00:18.108
But them times was all right.

01:00:26.051 --> 01:00:28.319
You ever killed a man before yesterday?

01:00:37.862 --> 01:00:40.864
'Bout six years back, my master died.

01:00:43.235 --> 01:00:46.770
His wife left for Boston
and set me free when she did.

01:00:48.874 --> 01:00:53.710
So I headed up north to earn money
to buy out my woman from her master.

01:00:56.515 --> 01:00:59.850
But a couple of pattyrollers
tried to take me back.

01:01:03.321 --> 01:01:05.809
I showed 'em my papers.

01:01:10.428 --> 01:01:12.565
I killed one of 'em.

01:01:13.165 --> 01:01:15.933
Maybe I ain't have to, but I did.

01:01:20.605 --> 01:01:24.708
After hidin' out near five years,
I lost touch with my woman.

01:01:26.678 --> 01:01:30.247
She ain't but five miles
down that way... or was.

01:01:36.488 --> 01:01:38.855
Probably should've never left her.

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:48.398
I miss her, but it can't be helped.

01:01:57.509 --> 01:02:00.510
I ain't never told no one
'bout that before.

01:02:01.846 --> 01:02:04.147
Why didn't you send word to her,

01:02:05.684 --> 01:02:07.918
tell her what happened?

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.091
It ain't safe knowin' a man like me.

01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:14.658
I'd have wanted to know what happened.

01:02:20.932 --> 01:02:24.067
That night before my father went north,

01:02:26.805 --> 01:02:30.240
we fought over somethin'...
what I can't even remember now.

01:02:37.249 --> 01:02:39.786
I wish I hadn't done that.

01:02:40.786 --> 01:02:44.354
I ain't sure he'd be too happy
to see me these days.

01:02:47.592 --> 01:02:49.573
He'd be proud of you.

01:02:55.767 --> 01:02:57.735
I got something to say.

01:03:04.276 --> 01:03:06.910
If you gotta do something...

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.581
you don't want to,

01:03:13.151 --> 01:03:15.193
that you know is wrong,

01:03:16.354 --> 01:03:18.655
but you ain't got no choice in it,

01:03:24.429 --> 01:03:26.365
are you goin' to hell?

01:03:26.765 --> 01:03:28.632
I don't know.

01:03:29.968 --> 01:03:33.003
You ain't got no choice,
you ain't got no choice.

01:03:34.806 --> 01:03:37.403
Most times, we got a choice.

01:04:00.098 --> 01:04:01.675
Nate?

01:04:11.643 --> 01:04:13.446
Nate?

01:04:13.546 --> 01:04:15.379
Nate!

01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:24.588
You thought I left you?

01:04:27.692 --> 01:04:28.996
I wouldn't leave you.

01:04:32.096 --> 01:04:34.698
But I might if you don't bathe soon.

01:04:45.176 --> 01:04:47.544
Maybe we should stop by
to see your woman.

01:04:48.413 --> 01:04:51.749
What? We gotta keep movin'.

01:04:52.784 --> 01:04:54.787
It ain't too far.

01:04:55.387 --> 01:04:57.754
Don't talk 'bout that no more.

01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:13.937
I don't know what the hell I'm doin'.

01:05:14.873 --> 01:05:16.632
Be quiet.

01:05:17.909 --> 01:05:20.212
I should just head on out of here.

01:05:20.312 --> 01:05:22.279
We done decided.

01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:27.987
She don't want to see me
after all this time.

01:05:28.487 --> 01:05:30.387
And I don't care nohow.

01:05:31.623 --> 01:05:33.257
Yes, you do.

01:05:55.813 --> 01:05:57.447
Yeah?

01:06:00.484 --> 01:06:02.755
There a woman name
of Rachel around here?

01:06:02.955 --> 01:06:04.745
Rachel live here.

01:06:05.991 --> 01:06:08.994
Sundays she go to town
with the master's wife.

01:06:09.094 --> 01:06:11.530
Sometimes they spend the night.

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:13.931
I think she'll be back this evening.

01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:20.137
You was her man?

01:06:22.306 --> 01:06:24.174
I's her man now.

01:06:26.811 --> 01:06:29.046
I don't think she'd be wantin'
to see you nohow.

01:06:30.815 --> 01:06:32.752
I heard about you.

01:06:33.152 --> 01:06:35.054
What'd you hear?

01:06:35.254 --> 01:06:37.656
Just that you was set free.

01:06:37.756 --> 01:06:40.457
You went up north.
You never come back like you said.

01:06:51.936 --> 01:06:54.073
She kept these.

01:06:54.173 --> 01:06:56.742
I ain't too fond of lookin' at 'em,

01:06:57.342 --> 01:06:59.209
if you want 'em.

01:07:01.413 --> 01:07:03.716
She kept them all this time?

01:07:03.816 --> 01:07:06.252
I don't know if I's supposed
to give 'em to you.

01:07:06.352 --> 01:07:08.651
She kept 'em so long.

01:07:10.188 --> 01:07:12.879
A man's boots is a man's boots,

01:07:14.459 --> 01:07:17.206
but she might not like me
givin' 'em to you.

01:07:19.698 --> 01:07:22.268
I never know what she thinkin'.

01:07:22.868 --> 01:07:25.471
Sometime her mood turn,
she let me hear about it.

01:07:25.571 --> 01:07:27.040
She used to let me hear about it.

01:07:27.672 --> 01:07:31.177
Sometimes I think the whole county
could hear about it once she got goin'.

01:07:31.277 --> 01:07:33.546
Hell, you probably know
all about that too.

01:07:33.646 --> 01:07:35.915
Lord knows I sure do.

01:07:36.115 --> 01:07:38.281
She's somethin' else.

01:07:41.418 --> 01:07:45.257
Hell, you should probably stay
and talk a while.

01:07:45.357 --> 01:07:47.491
You probably got all kinds
of stories to tell.

01:07:57.201 --> 01:08:01.137
Well, I'll tell her you come by.

01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:06.877
Yeah.

01:08:17.254 --> 01:08:19.158
We can wait.

01:08:19.258 --> 01:08:21.527
She might be back this evening.

01:08:21.727 --> 01:08:23.233
No.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:28.198
We should push on. We could reach
my brother by tomorrow afternoon.

01:09:12.609 --> 01:09:13.779
Rachel.

01:09:13.879 --> 01:09:15.348
Now?

01:09:16.548 --> 01:09:18.015
Now?

01:09:20.317 --> 01:09:21.861
Tell me.

01:09:23.386 --> 01:09:25.354
- Tell me.
- All right.

01:09:30.094 --> 01:09:33.187
- I went up north like I said.
- You was supposed to come back for me.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.527
Why didn't you come back?

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.774
You could have told me something.

01:09:59.757 --> 01:10:02.259
So you responsible for that boy now?

01:10:06.698 --> 01:10:08.799
You ain't worth a damn.

01:10:09.867 --> 01:10:12.368
Comin' back here now.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:17.874
Come here, boy.

01:10:20.077 --> 01:10:22.748
Look at you... all filthy.

01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:24.750
Moth-eaten.

01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:28.253
I wouldn't expect no more from him,
but somebody gotta take care of you.

01:10:28.453 --> 01:10:32.489
- We been traveling...
- Don't. Don't talk at me.

01:10:34.892 --> 01:10:38.361
- I'm all right.
- You all right?

01:10:40.131 --> 01:10:42.191
He ain't got nobody?

01:10:43.202 --> 01:10:46.338
If he ain't got nobody, just leave him
here till they figure somethin'.

01:10:46.438 --> 01:10:49.341
I... I got people.

01:10:49.441 --> 01:10:51.644
You got people.

01:10:51.744 --> 01:10:53.443
Kin?

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.840
Lord.

01:10:58.549 --> 01:11:01.386
You sure you ain't his son?

01:11:01.486 --> 01:11:03.987
'Cause you just as much trouble.

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.528
We should get on now.

01:11:15.099 --> 01:11:17.345
Don't make me no difference.

01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:06.749
What's wrong?

01:12:14.392 --> 01:12:16.293
We need to eat.

01:12:20.364 --> 01:12:23.068
There's stores at the crossroads.

01:12:23.468 --> 01:12:25.571
Some sell to Negroes.

01:12:25.771 --> 01:12:27.804
I can't be seen up there.

01:12:30.775 --> 01:12:34.446
This is just enough to get us hardtack
and venison for tonight.

01:12:34.546 --> 01:12:36.179
I'll be here.

01:12:40.117 --> 01:12:41.284
Be careful.

01:13:04.018 --> 01:13:05.175
This too?

01:13:18.055 --> 01:13:20.257
This ain't enough.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.935
You got whiskey?

01:13:54.592 --> 01:13:56.426
What's all this?

01:13:58.396 --> 01:14:00.563
So you ain't too cold.

01:14:02.833 --> 01:14:05.468
You spent your pa's double eagle?

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:14.911
I'll give this to my brother.
It could be a comfort to him.

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.756
Drink some now.

01:14:32.362 --> 01:14:34.346
We made it, didn't we?

01:14:49.647 --> 01:14:52.882
I don't know about seeing
my brother after all this time.

01:14:54.218 --> 01:14:56.052
I don't know.

01:14:58.422 --> 01:15:01.460
Things ain't always happen the way
they supposed to with him.

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.393
Or with me.

01:15:05.129 --> 01:15:07.664
I ain't really lived like I should.

01:15:08.499 --> 01:15:10.767
I've wasted time.

01:15:12.703 --> 01:15:15.471
And it ain't always been my fault.

01:15:25.483 --> 01:15:30.222
But I'm gonna do what I need to,
and things gonna be better.

01:15:30.322 --> 01:15:32.477
I'm gonna be better.

01:15:37.494 --> 01:15:39.773
What you think about that?

01:16:04.021 --> 01:16:06.022
You want to hold it?

01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:09.425
You can keep it till mornin'.

01:16:46.664 --> 01:16:48.454
You know,

01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:52.582
I got a little saved up.

01:16:54.271 --> 01:16:58.310
After I take care of my brother, we can
go back north and look for your father.

01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:01.076
If you want.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.352
Hell, even if we don't find him,

01:17:08.052 --> 01:17:10.119
you can travel with me long as you want.

01:17:13.224 --> 01:17:15.558
We can go out west.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.928
Things supposed to be
different out there.

01:17:25.169 --> 01:17:28.404
Maybe I could do for you
what no one done for me.

01:17:31.342 --> 01:17:33.910
Ain't no point goin' it alone, really.

01:17:37.455 --> 01:17:39.499
What you think about that?

01:17:42.315 --> 01:17:43.882
Well?

01:17:47.925 --> 01:17:49.486
Well...

01:17:50.615 --> 01:17:52.621
you think about it.

01:22:38.916 --> 01:22:41.350
I was just thinking about you.

01:22:47.591 --> 01:22:49.578
Y'all get held up?

01:22:52.295 --> 01:22:54.265
Marcus ain't make it.

01:22:54.365 --> 01:22:56.498
Yeah, I heard.

01:23:01.138 --> 01:23:05.107
When we ride up,
he best be waitin' for me.

01:23:07.177 --> 01:23:09.648
But I know he will...

01:23:10.048 --> 01:23:12.465
'cause you're coming with us.

01:23:13.684 --> 01:23:15.753
He's here.

01:23:16.353 --> 01:23:19.157
I couldn't get his knife.

01:23:19.257 --> 01:23:21.432
Give me an hour.

01:23:21.532 --> 01:23:23.259
I'll get it.

01:23:51.121 --> 01:23:53.455
We should get movin' soon.

01:23:55.325 --> 01:23:57.059
Come on, now.

01:24:10.507 --> 01:24:12.675
Ain't no wind today.

01:24:14.511 --> 01:24:16.545
Should be warmer.

01:24:26.256 --> 01:24:28.490
Boy, what's wrong with you?

01:24:35.812 --> 01:24:37.391
Well?

01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:41.570
Speak up.

01:24:46.309 --> 01:24:48.010
Speak up.

01:24:49.312 --> 01:24:51.851
I want to get to my brother before dark.

01:25:00.657 --> 01:25:02.958
Your brother's dead.

01:25:08.499 --> 01:25:11.567
We was supposed to bring you
for bounty hunters.

01:25:13.536 --> 01:25:16.171
They were gonna kill you for the money.

01:25:21.244 --> 01:25:24.380
They said they'd kill us
if we didn't bring you.

01:25:29.352 --> 01:25:31.920
You got to go far from here.

01:25:51.108 --> 01:25:53.378
You ain't deserve none of this.

01:26:21.037 --> 01:26:21.974
They're comin'!

01:26:22.974 --> 01:26:26.742
They're here!
We got to run or fight. We gotta go.

01:26:35.352 --> 01:26:36.786
Will?

01:26:39.656 --> 01:26:42.057
Come on out now.

01:26:46.096 --> 01:26:48.730
Let us do what we come for.

01:26:51.435 --> 01:26:54.305
Or else we can do you too.

01:26:54.405 --> 01:26:56.207
Nothin' gonna happen to you.

01:26:56.307 --> 01:26:58.950
- You gonna be all right.
- Other side!

01:27:01.613 --> 01:27:04.480
Go round back. Go on now!

01:27:05.549 --> 01:27:06.904
Give me your other knife.

01:27:08.651 --> 01:27:09.952
Will?

01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:15.657
This ain't your fault, son.

01:27:16.326 --> 01:27:18.663
You ain't like them.

01:27:18.763 --> 01:27:21.497
You risked your own skin by tellin' me.

01:27:24.234 --> 01:27:26.235
I'm proud of you.

01:27:43.353 --> 01:27:47.358
Leave that there so they see it.
You go north now.

01:27:47.458 --> 01:27:50.494
Take Rachel to them people
in the swamp till this war's over.

01:27:50.994 --> 01:27:53.362
Then you go find your pa.

01:27:54.164 --> 01:27:56.467
- I'll catch up with you.
- Will!

01:27:56.567 --> 01:27:58.190
If I don't,

01:28:00.637 --> 01:28:02.871
you give half that to Rachel.

01:28:05.075 --> 01:28:06.346
No!

01:28:09.091 --> 01:28:11.814
No! No!

01:28:15.719 --> 01:28:17.287
Nate!

01:28:45.048 --> 01:28:46.884
You done good.

01:28:46.984 --> 01:28:49.018
You done good.

01:28:56.526 --> 01:28:58.560
You're free to go.

01:29:01.177 --> 01:29:03.784
Don't follow us if you want to live.
