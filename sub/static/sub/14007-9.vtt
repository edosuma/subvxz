00:01.155 --> 00:02.835
<i>Previously on</i> Damages...

00:03.125 --> 00:04.796
UNR's lead counsel

00:04.880 --> 00:07.298
was defending a prostitute
on drug charges.

00:07.382 --> 00:08.925
She was with an energy trader.

00:09.009 --> 00:09.943
Finn Garrety.

00:09.985 --> 00:13.930
Kendrick could be using him
to manipulate the energy market.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.807
- The trade went through.
- All right.

00:16.245 --> 00:19.560
Does Finn know a guy
by the name of Walter Kendrick?

00:19.855 --> 00:22.354
- I don't know.
- Can you try and find out?

00:23.265 --> 00:24.440
I'll see what I can do.

00:24.805 --> 00:26.484
The stock will rise,

00:26.735 --> 00:28.236
the case will vanish.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.820
Invest in UNR, Phil.

00:30.105 --> 00:31.813
I want to take a position in UNR.

00:31.855 --> 00:35.076
We both know what's going on here.
I don't want to dance around it anymore.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.210
Let's have dinner or something.

00:38.497 --> 00:39.497
Okay.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.165
Maybe I should take you off this{\ thing}.

00:41.525 --> 00:42.834
She'll come to me.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.063
If {\Parsons}she isn't talking,
you'll have to try someone else.

00:45.105 --> 00:46.671
- Who?
- Katie Connor.

00:46.825 --> 00:48.716
I'm Agent Harrison.
This is Agent Werner.

00:48.758 --> 00:49.882
We're with the FBI.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.510
Pete swallowed a bottle
of his wife's meds

00:52.635 --> 00:54.762
so that he wouldn't have
to give us evidence on Patty.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.533
What did the feds ask you for?

00:56.575 --> 00:59.713
If I don't give 'em enough to put you
in jail, they're putting me there.

00:59.755 --> 01:02.005
<i>You give them whatever you need to.</i>

01:03.235 --> 01:06.023
Patty, I called the hospital
to check in on Pete.

01:06.065 --> 01:07.900
<i>I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

01:18.765 --> 01:21.581
I was wrong.
I don't think Patty had Pete killed.

01:21.623 --> 01:22.423
Why not?

01:22.465 --> 01:24.593
She seems genuinely
thrown by his death.

01:24.635 --> 01:27.713
She believes that he arranged it
himself to protect her.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.833
Well, if it wasn't Patty,
then who did it?

01:29.875 --> 01:31.673
I don't know,
but she blames you guys.

01:31.715 --> 01:33.703
This is like a call to war for her.

01:33.745 --> 01:34.895
Meaning what?

01:35.155 --> 01:37.023
Meaning you're not
just targeting her now.

01:37.065 --> 01:38.565
She's targeting you.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.813
The firm is being
investigated by the FBI?

01:46.295 --> 01:47.495
I'm afraid so.

01:47.691 --> 01:48.991
How do you know?

01:49.475 --> 01:50.775
They came to me.

01:51.725 --> 01:53.925
They asked me to inform on Patty.

01:54.245 --> 01:55.645
I turned 'em down.

01:56.835 --> 01:58.284
Then they went to Pete.

01:59.755 --> 02:00.755
Is that why he...

02:00.797 --> 02:03.581
He didn't want to give up
anything that could hurt us.

02:06.095 --> 02:07.095
Jesus.

02:07.755 --> 02:10.104
So now we have to circle the wagons.

02:11.155 --> 02:12.632
Has anyone approached you?

02:12.743 --> 02:13.743
Of course not.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.927
I mean, no unusual overtures?

02:16.715 --> 02:18.315
I would have told you.

02:18.725 --> 02:20.556
When were you going to tell me?

02:20.725 --> 02:22.225
I'm telling you now.

02:31.725 --> 02:33.325
I'm sorry, Mr. Shayes.

02:33.415 --> 02:34.593
I have to see Patty.

02:34.635 --> 02:35.919
You're not allowed in here.

02:35.961 --> 02:38.699
- Well, it's urgent.
- I have strict orders from Ms. Hewes.

02:38.955 --> 02:41.143
Believe me, she's gonna want
to hear what I have to say.

02:41.185 --> 02:43.621
Sir, you're not allowed
in the building anymore.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.082
Let's do this the easy way.

02:52.025 --> 02:54.325
Tell Patty that I tried to warn her.

02:55.265 --> 02:58.594
And let her know that I'm filing a suit
against her, for wrongful...

02:58.678 --> 02:59.874
termination!

03:18.785 --> 03:19.785
Hey.

03:26.595 --> 03:28.332
Hope you know what you're doing.

03:29.685 --> 03:30.685
I do.

03:35.645 --> 03:36.795
Ellen, don't.

03:41.935 --> 03:43.431
It's not who you are.

03:45.141 --> 03:49.020
Damages Season 2 Episode 9 V1.0 0tv
You Got Your Prom Date Pregnant

03:50.355 --> 03:51.898
Synchro: Gaillots and Salomon.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.735
Thanks to Valpi.

04:25.515 --> 04:26.891
www.seriestele.net

04:29.175 --> 04:32.021
Energy Secretary has a heart attack
at his own wedding.

04:33.495 --> 04:34.495
Pathetic.

04:36.345 --> 04:39.345
It was gonna be his third marriage.
He knew what he was doing.

04:40.115 --> 04:42.873
Where are they on replacing him
at the Department of Energy?

04:42.915 --> 04:46.163
I'm on the president's search committee.
We're just beginning to look.

04:46.205 --> 04:47.505
In this climate,

04:47.675 --> 04:50.460
we're likely to get
some regulation crusader

04:50.502 --> 04:52.291
who thinks he's another
goddamn Eliot Ness.

04:52.715 --> 04:53.915
Use your pull.

04:54.255 --> 04:55.586
Install an ally.

04:55.735 --> 04:56.735
I plan to.

04:57.495 --> 05:00.508
In the meantime, I want to step up
the frequency of our transactions.

05:01.265 --> 05:03.764
There's only so many times
we're gonna be able to pull this off

05:03.806 --> 05:05.388
before someone notices.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.557
You're not getting cold feet,
are you, Walt?

05:12.245 --> 05:13.245
No, Dave.

05:14.875 --> 05:15.875
Good.

05:16.682 --> 05:18.442
Then get the information
to my trader.

05:28.465 --> 05:31.288
We're being investigated by the FBI,
and you didn't tell me?

05:31.395 --> 05:33.499
- Tom.
- You had no right to withhold that.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.744
This isn't just about you, Patty.
I'm a partner here.

05:36.815 --> 05:38.315
I'm vulnerable, too.

05:39.155 --> 05:41.705
Yes, you are, so just calm down,

05:41.995 --> 05:44.385
and we'll figure out
what we're going to do about this.

05:50.685 --> 05:53.103
Who can you talk to
that has an in at the Bureau?

05:53.145 --> 05:54.145
No one.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.179
I can't risk exposing myself.

05:56.615 --> 05:59.665
Then I'll make a call
because we need information.

06:02.675 --> 06:03.675
What's up?

06:04.625 --> 06:06.574
Last time I saw that face,
you were 18

06:06.616 --> 06:08.816
and thought you got
your prom date pregnant.

06:09.495 --> 06:11.345
It's about Patty, isn't it?

06:11.525 --> 06:13.533
I think the firm's
under investigation.

06:13.575 --> 06:16.175
- Under investigation by whom?
- The FBI.

06:16.305 --> 06:18.291
- For what?
- I have no idea.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.729
I told you you should have cut
and run after the Frobisher case.

06:20.771 --> 06:23.257
Look, I know your feelings
about Patty and her legal ethics.

06:23.935 --> 06:24.973
So let me guess.

06:25.015 --> 06:28.381
You want me to use my contacts to get
you information about the investigation.

06:28.423 --> 06:30.373
I need to know what
they have on Patty.

06:30.415 --> 06:32.515
I am an assistant U.S. attorney.

06:33.155 --> 06:35.770
What you're asking
is totally inappropriate.

06:36.705 --> 06:37.705
Please.

06:39.975 --> 06:41.543
It's my... it's my career.

06:41.585 --> 06:43.633
I can't believe
you're putting me in this position.

06:43.675 --> 06:45.203
Look, I don't know what to say.

06:45.245 --> 06:46.489
You're my sister.

06:48.485 --> 06:49.835
I need your help.

06:51.365 --> 06:52.365
Fine.

06:52.725 --> 06:54.675
I'll see what I can find out.

07:00.165 --> 07:04.165
- Mr. Garrety, thank you for coming.
- You got a real nice club here.

07:04.565 --> 07:06.215
Thank you, have a seat.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.389
There's a new itinerary.

07:13.025 --> 07:15.101
We going on another trip?
Same car?

07:15.185 --> 07:18.020
You'll be contacted with new codes.
We're gonna try another location.

07:18.265 --> 07:20.439
They have something salty around here?
Maybe some nuts?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.317
I'm sure we can accommodate you.

07:23.401 --> 07:27.070
Better yet, maybe some of
the Chinese mix with the wasabi peas.

07:28.095 --> 07:29.095
Certainly.

07:30.005 --> 07:32.618
First, though,
how are your meetings going?

07:32.702 --> 07:33.802
My meetings?

07:33.905 --> 07:35.555
Oh, you mean for the...

07:35.705 --> 07:36.805
Going great.

07:37.025 --> 07:38.582
I totally kicked the stuff.

07:39.065 --> 07:40.084
And the girl?

07:40.605 --> 07:42.055
She's history, too.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.815
These are smart moves, Mr. Garrety,

07:47.225 --> 07:50.532
because if you want me to ensure
your continued fiscal success,

07:50.574 --> 07:53.138
you won't ever make
another mess for me again.

08:00.875 --> 08:04.525
If you know another trader
who can do what I do, Mr. Pell,

08:05.655 --> 08:06.655
use him.

08:09.545 --> 08:10.545
Otherwise,

08:11.245 --> 08:12.745
stay out of my face.

08:16.325 --> 08:17.925
Forget about the nuts.

08:29.115 --> 08:30.415
Better not miss.

08:32.005 --> 08:33.655
She should be so lucky.

08:33.725 --> 08:36.015
You miss this and I run the table.

08:36.155 --> 08:37.683
We'll see about that.

08:39.095 --> 08:41.437
You are a terrible pool player.

08:41.905 --> 08:44.605
Maybe that's just
what I want you to think.

08:45.375 --> 08:47.173
The hustle began hours ago.

08:47.215 --> 08:49.203
- You just didn't notice it.
- Is that so?

08:49.245 --> 08:51.488
First I invite myself
to girls' night out.

08:51.895 --> 08:53.762
I throw a game or two,
and before you know it,

08:53.804 --> 08:55.951
the gouging starts
and you lose your shirts.

08:56.354 --> 08:57.499
I can't wait.

09:00.785 --> 09:03.435
Or maybe I am just
a terrible pool player.

09:06.703 --> 09:07.503
Here.

09:07.805 --> 09:09.882
I'm gonna get a club soda.
You want anything?

09:10.325 --> 09:11.475
No, I'm good.

09:11.965 --> 09:13.915
Laying off the sauce.
Smart.

09:14.045 --> 09:16.013
You want to stay sharp
while I mount my comeback.

09:16.455 --> 09:18.255
Yeah, good luck with that.

09:22.885 --> 09:25.730
Sorry I'm a third wheel.
I hope you don't mind.

09:27.215 --> 09:28.442
No, it's fine.

09:49.285 --> 09:50.485
How you doing?

09:51.800 --> 09:52.800
I'm fine.

09:55.215 --> 09:57.493
Look, about this dinner party
we're hosting...

09:57.535 --> 09:58.693
What about it?

09:58.735 --> 10:00.485
My instinct is to cancel,

10:01.925 --> 10:04.425
but it might be nice for you
to have some friends around.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.605
That's fine.

10:12.255 --> 10:14.363
Do they know how Uncle Pete died?

10:14.405 --> 10:16.448
The hospital is still investigating.

10:17.155 --> 10:18.943
But you think he killed himself.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.685
Or had someone help him.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.205
Pete was trying to protect me.

10:28.235 --> 10:29.285
Look at me.

10:34.083 --> 10:34.883
What?

10:34.925 --> 10:37.425
- Drop the UNR case.
- I can't do that.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.348
You've confirmed
the FBI is targeting you.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.390
Yes,

10:41.795 --> 10:43.695
and as far as I'm concerned,

10:44.035 --> 10:45.685
they killed Uncle Pete.

10:47.155 --> 10:49.113
They're trying to intimidate me.

10:49.155 --> 10:50.955
They want me to back down.

10:51.185 --> 10:53.635
This is about power
protecting itself.

10:54.415 --> 10:56.905
I threaten them,
and they hate me for it.

10:57.655 --> 10:58.705
Who's they?

10:59.025 --> 11:01.025
The FBI, the government,

11:01.705 --> 11:03.963
Walter Kendrick and UNR.
They're all the same.

11:04.005 --> 11:05.314
You're being paranoid.

11:06.285 --> 11:07.873
They're closing in on me, Phil.

11:07.915 --> 11:10.665
They approached Ellen,
they approached Pete.

11:10.765 --> 11:12.415
And look what happened.

11:15.645 --> 11:16.645
Stop.

11:18.305 --> 11:19.405
Please stop.

11:23.065 --> 11:25.615
I'm not gonna let them
get away with it.

11:33.565 --> 11:35.865
- So, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

11:36.955 --> 11:40.955
I'm concerned about what's going on
between you and Wes Krulik.

11:42.985 --> 11:44.285
What's going on?

11:45.465 --> 11:49.065
I can see in group
that the two of you are getting...

11:49.200 --> 11:50.000
Close?

11:51.535 --> 11:55.535
I think maybe you should come
to different sessions from now on.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.175
I've also spoken to Wes.

12:01.675 --> 12:03.975
- And what did he say?
- He agreed.

12:07.045 --> 12:09.395
It's not healthy, Ellen.

12:13.595 --> 12:15.895
You think it's too soon after David?

12:16.465 --> 12:17.465
I think...

12:17.778 --> 12:20.978
You and Wes may be filling
a need for each other

12:21.425 --> 12:23.025
that's based on grief.

12:24.555 --> 12:26.205
What's wrong with that?

12:26.285 --> 12:29.373
It can be emotionally dangerous.

12:29.975 --> 12:31.375
So can loneliness.

12:31.965 --> 12:35.965
But jumping into a relationship
just to fill the loneliness won't help.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.255
You want my advice?

12:45.615 --> 12:46.665
Absolutely.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.835
You know I value your opinion.

12:50.575 --> 12:52.225
Energy is not my field.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.440
I'm not sure I know anyone
who's even qualified.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.401
Since when has that been necessary
for a government appointment?

12:57.633 --> 12:58.633
All right.

12:58.675 --> 13:00.279
This is a cabinet position.

13:00.615 --> 13:01.884
I don't need an expert.

13:01.926 --> 13:04.293
I need someone who's going
to support the industry.

13:04.335 --> 13:06.135
Well, that's a tall order.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.053
I mean,
given the mood in Washington,

13:08.095 --> 13:11.331
there's no way the Senate's gonna
confirm anyone who's not pro-regulation.

13:11.735 --> 13:12.735
True.

13:13.035 --> 13:15.283
But if I know you,
that's not what you want.

13:15.325 --> 13:17.842
You're looking for someone
who reads, interventionist,

13:17.884 --> 13:19.965
but who has a free market heart.

13:22.405 --> 13:23.405
See?

13:24.805 --> 13:26.555
That's why I came to you.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.175
Have you thought
about Sam Arsenault?

13:31.795 --> 13:33.995
Word is, he's a bit unpredictable.

13:34.935 --> 13:37.089
Started as an Independent,

13:37.131 --> 13:39.485
then tried to get the Republicans
to back him for governor.

13:39.569 --> 13:43.405
Trust me, Sam Arsenault's only
real loyalty is to the Capitalist Party.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.005
We're gonna have
a{\ little} dinner party {\on }Friday{\ night}.

13:48.047 --> 13:50.204
If I can get {\Arsenault}him to be there,
do you want to meet him?

13:54.145 --> 13:55.645
You're tense. Relax.

13:56.625 --> 13:57.625
Relax.

13:57.945 --> 13:58.945
Breathe.

13:59.575 --> 14:00.575
That's it.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.425
It's firm, not tight.

14:04.605 --> 14:06.470
It feels like
I won't be able to control it.

14:06.975 --> 14:10.725
You try to control it too much,
you get stiff and lose accuracy.

14:10.905 --> 14:12.154
Keep breathing.

14:14.065 --> 14:15.115
How's that?

14:15.285 --> 14:16.335
Feels good.

14:19.835 --> 14:20.935
Let her rip.

14:30.985 --> 14:32.496
I see it, but I don't believe it.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.907
Believe it, cowboy.

14:33.949 --> 14:35.948
You should hang it in your office.

14:35.990 --> 14:37.990
I think you'll find people
will treat you{\ a little} nicer.

14:38.032 --> 14:39.782
That is a very good idea.

14:40.455 --> 14:42.256
Better to be feared than respected.

14:44.075 --> 14:45.675
Thanks for helping me.

14:47.365 --> 14:49.265
Ellen, I owe you an apology.

14:49.605 --> 14:50.605
For what?

14:52.445 --> 14:54.935
A couple weeks ago,
I shouldn't have asked you out.

14:55.585 --> 14:57.843
- Don't worry about that.
- No. I pushed you.

14:57.885 --> 14:59.035
It was wrong.

14:59.085 --> 15:00.573
I'm a big girl. I can handle it.

15:00.615 --> 15:04.115
I think we both know that
you and I shouldn't get involved.

15:04.455 --> 15:06.155
The way we met, therapy.

15:08.285 --> 15:10.185
- You agree, right?
- Yeah.

15:10.827 --> 15:11.827
Good.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.702
Me too, because I was...

15:15.755 --> 15:17.055
This is awkward.

15:17.795 --> 15:20.695
I was wondering
if I could ask out your friend.

15:23.206 --> 15:24.006
Katie?

15:24.185 --> 15:25.299
If it's okay.

15:25.733 --> 15:26.583
Yeah.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.302
Yeah, we had fun
the other night, and...

15:29.395 --> 15:32.014
Yeah, of course.
I'll give you her number.

15:50.005 --> 15:51.983
I haven't met with
Katie Connor alone yet.

15:52.025 --> 15:53.725
I got nothing to report.

15:54.065 --> 15:56.015
I got something else for you.

16:03.825 --> 16:05.510
What am I supposed to do with these?

16:05.552 --> 16:08.342
Deliver them to Jersey.
The address is in the glove compartment.

16:16.735 --> 16:18.235
Did you just say no?

16:19.875 --> 16:23.375
I agreed to do this thing
with Ellen Parsons,

16:23.965 --> 16:26.465
but I am done with this other shit.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.475
You're done when I say you are.

16:35.455 --> 16:37.579
Make sure the tank's full
when you bring it back.

16:58.105 --> 16:59.255
Thanks, baby.

16:59.425 --> 17:01.075
Your dealer is a creep.

17:01.795 --> 17:03.595
Yeah, but his shit's good.

17:09.075 --> 17:10.075
You want?

17:10.825 --> 17:11.825
No.

17:12.045 --> 17:13.994
I'm getting clean for my kid.

17:15.214 --> 17:16.615
That's very sweet.

17:18.005 --> 17:19.454
But what's going on

17:19.964 --> 17:22.565
with that lawyer
who was asking about me?

17:22.855 --> 17:23.855
Nothing.

17:23.896 --> 17:26.703
He keeps calling,
and I keep blowing him off.

17:27.775 --> 17:28.775
Good girl.

17:30.625 --> 17:33.625
If this ever traces back to me,
I will be disbarred.

17:34.255 --> 17:35.255
So will I.

17:35.325 --> 17:37.275
Mutually assured destruction.

17:38.265 --> 17:41.365
I requisitioned the FBI file
on Hewes & Associates.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.925
- What do they have on Patty?
- Tom, there was no file.

17:46.082 --> 17:48.398
- What do you mean?
- It means, there's no official file

17:48.440 --> 17:50.340
on Patty Hewes or her firm.

17:51.725 --> 17:53.575
- Was it classified?
- No.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.253
Even if it were,
there would still be a file.

17:56.295 --> 17:59.828
It would be off-limits, but there would
be a record the investigation existed.

18:00.365 --> 18:02.965
- Was there anything on Pete McKee?
- No.

18:03.265 --> 18:07.165
Nothing on anybody involved
with Hewes & Associates, including you.

18:08.405 --> 18:09.655
I don't get it.

18:10.575 --> 18:12.902
The FBI approached
one of our associates.

18:12.944 --> 18:15.444
Uncle Pete killed himself

18:16.145 --> 18:18.930
so the government couldn't use him
against Patty.

18:19.015 --> 18:22.058
I don't know what to tell you.
There's no investigation.

18:31.765 --> 18:32.765
No file?

18:33.515 --> 18:34.863
That doesn't make any sense.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.531
The guys who approached you,
you sure they were legit?

18:37.616 --> 18:39.416
Yeah.
They were FBI.

18:40.005 --> 18:41.105
You're sure?

18:41.345 --> 18:42.395
Absolutely.

18:46.414 --> 18:48.059
Are you sure you can
trust your sister?

18:48.421 --> 18:50.754
She wouldn't have told
me unless she were 100%.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.493
What the hell is going on?

18:57.177 --> 18:59.721
What is really going on
with this investigation?

19:00.089 --> 19:01.090
What do you mean?

19:01.294 --> 19:04.879
The FBI has no file on Patty Hewes,
Tom Shayes, or on me.

19:06.885 --> 19:07.982
Who told you that?

19:08.218 --> 19:09.481
I have my sources.

19:10.227 --> 19:11.951
You need to tell us
where you heard that.

19:11.993 --> 19:14.457
Why the hell is there no record
of this investigation?

19:17.837 --> 19:19.087
Do we tell her?

19:20.027 --> 19:22.203
I think it's time
she knew the truth.

19:26.589 --> 19:28.468
We don't work for the FBI, Ellen.

19:29.655 --> 19:30.821
Who do you work for?

19:31.777 --> 19:32.677
The IPF.

19:33.727 --> 19:34.604
The what?

19:34.892 --> 19:36.514
Inter-Planetary Federation.

19:37.879 --> 19:39.285
You never saw Men in Black?

19:39.776 --> 19:40.953
You guys are jackasses.

19:40.995 --> 19:42.238
Ellen, listen.

19:43.259 --> 19:45.776
We know Patty has contacts
at the Justice Department.

19:46.177 --> 19:47.397
We had to pull the file.

19:47.439 --> 19:49.646
We couldn't risk letting
anyone tip her off.

19:50.543 --> 19:51.480
You understand?

19:54.818 --> 19:56.570
You'd better be
telling me the truth.

20:01.153 --> 20:02.316
Well, she's smart.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.706
Yeah, I get that,

20:05.595 --> 20:06.724
but I don't like her.

20:07.421 --> 20:09.187
Question is, can we trust her intel?

20:11.125 --> 20:11.880
Can we?

20:23.114 --> 20:23.881
Coming.

20:28.255 --> 20:29.654
Relax, will ya?

20:33.104 --> 20:35.379
New clients are always impatient.

20:38.595 --> 20:39.571
Who are you?

20:40.200 --> 20:41.331
My name's Patty.

20:44.008 --> 20:46.735
The attorney you've been talking
to is a partner in my firm.

20:47.684 --> 20:49.748
You stopped returning his calls.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.166
What do you want?

20:51.749 --> 20:53.072
I'd like an explanation

20:53.114 --> 20:56.231
of what happened the night you
and Finn Garrety were arrested.

21:02.664 --> 21:04.670
- Who are you calling?
- My agency.

21:05.070 --> 21:06.240
You have to leave.

21:06.282 --> 21:07.349
Well, in that case,

21:07.553 --> 21:10.602
I'll just call Finn.
Let him know you see other clients.

21:11.158 --> 21:12.108
Go ahead.

21:12.316 --> 21:13.644
- He won't care.
- No?

21:13.847 --> 21:15.674
He doesn't think you're exclusive?

21:19.867 --> 21:22.318
We're on the same side here.
All I want to do is talk.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.185
You gonna pay for the hour?

21:29.923 --> 21:31.206
I've looked into you.

21:31.786 --> 21:34.250
I know you're trying to put
yourself through school.

21:39.724 --> 21:41.946
You also have a failed marriage,

21:42.703 --> 21:44.209
two stints in rehab,

21:45.285 --> 21:48.598
a kid you never see, and you're
in one hell of a custody battle.

21:50.931 --> 21:52.479
Now, if you come in and talk to us,

21:52.521 --> 21:55.002
I will pay for your tuition
in night school.

21:55.352 --> 21:56.749
I will give you protection,

21:57.848 --> 22:01.111
and I'll put in a good word
with your family court judge.

22:01.849 --> 22:03.530
And if I don't talk to you?

22:05.163 --> 22:08.784
Family courts don't take kindly
to mothers who are prostitutes.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.082
It would be a shame
if they found out.

22:17.659 --> 22:18.808
Great to see you.

22:18.850 --> 22:20.505
- Glad you could make it.
- Thank you.

22:20.848 --> 22:24.495
It doesn't really matter if the economy
tanks, as long as people need doctors,

22:24.850 --> 22:27.094
medical malpractice
attorneys will have work.

22:27.136 --> 22:29.185
Doesn't say much
for the state of health care.

22:29.227 --> 22:30.933
You shouldn't be telling him this.

22:30.975 --> 22:34.697
I'm going in for a simple
hernia surgery next week.

22:34.849 --> 22:37.378
Yeah, they're all simple
until they're not.

22:37.645 --> 22:39.065
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.248
Hey, sport.

22:40.290 --> 22:42.282
Hey, Mr. Arsenault.

22:42.643 --> 22:43.695
How's Lily doing?

22:43.930 --> 22:45.870
It's been pretty
tough since the arrest.

22:46.020 --> 22:47.824
But Yale's considering
taking her back.

22:48.475 --> 22:49.492
That's great.

22:50.110 --> 22:51.873
- Tell her I said hi.
- Sure will.

22:53.993 --> 22:56.319
- Sam Arsenault.
- Say hello to Dave Pell.

22:56.538 --> 22:58.073
I've heard a lot about you, Dave.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.059
- What's your poison?
- Gimlet, gin.

23:01.101 --> 23:03.061
- Coming up, you okay?
- I'm fine, thanks, Phil.

23:03.962 --> 23:05.549
I hear I'm being vetted.

23:05.635 --> 23:08.970
Rumors travel halfway around the world
before truth can tie its shoes.

23:09.978 --> 23:11.917
So, are we traveling or lacing up?

23:12.285 --> 23:13.099
Depends.

23:13.623 --> 23:14.771
Are you interested?

23:15.028 --> 23:17.176
Bill Richardson.
Now, there's a man who did it right.

23:17.650 --> 23:20.185
Serves one term as Energy
Secretary under Clinton,

23:20.227 --> 23:21.994
then heads home
and becomes Governor.

23:22.478 --> 23:24.576
I've always wanted to be Governor.

23:24.780 --> 23:26.322
That's an admirable goal.

23:26.626 --> 23:28.615
Ask around.
I'm a pragmatist.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.031
You're prepared to faithfully represent
the interests of your country?

23:32.895 --> 23:34.829
Well, we're all businessmen here,
are we?

23:42.127 --> 23:45.173
What's going on out there? Is it safe
for me to jump back into the market?

23:45.421 --> 23:47.300
That depends how
strong your stomach is.

23:47.916 --> 23:49.990
Come on, Phil,
give us a little something.

23:50.293 --> 23:52.288
Well, there are ample
opportunities out there.

23:52.330 --> 23:55.267
Like Mr. Buffet says,
"When everybody else is fearful,

23:55.627 --> 23:56.893
it's time to be greedy".

23:57.141 --> 24:00.001
Look, the point is,
these things are cyclical.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.316
The market is a force of nature,

24:02.665 --> 24:04.484
and the economy
is going to correct itself.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.064
With a little oversight.

24:09.919 --> 24:13.230
My wife and I are of the same
mind on a great number of things.

24:13.272 --> 24:15.495
This is the one area
where we differ.

24:16.257 --> 24:19.666
Phil makes the mistake of believing
that man is inherently good.

24:19.793 --> 24:23.211
No, I believe that man is
inherently self-interested,

24:23.771 --> 24:26.356
and the only way to keep self-interest
in check

24:26.812 --> 24:29.175
is through free market competition.

24:29.671 --> 24:31.307
Sam, you'll back me up on that.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.930
What?
What was the question?

24:36.017 --> 24:37.559
Sam, whose side are you on anyway?

24:37.889 --> 24:39.635
Whoever refills this first.

24:41.141 --> 24:43.496
So, did Wes call you?

24:44.048 --> 24:44.949
Yes.

24:45.856 --> 24:47.532
Kind of out of the blue, actually.

24:47.574 --> 24:49.723
He asked me for your number.
I hope you don't mind.

24:49.765 --> 24:50.563
No.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.576
I don't even know if this
is a weird question to ask.

24:56.180 --> 24:57.829
Would you mind
if I went out with him?

24:58.319 --> 24:59.254
Jesus.

24:59.296 --> 25:01.124
You need to ask my permission,
as well?

25:01.309 --> 25:02.500
He asked the same thing?

25:02.585 --> 25:03.354
Yes.

25:04.085 --> 25:05.340
And no, I don't mind.

25:05.382 --> 25:06.715
God, why would I mind?

25:07.984 --> 25:09.281
I don't know, I thought...

25:09.521 --> 25:11.467
maybe you two might have something.

25:12.368 --> 25:14.640
We're just friends.
I'm not ready for that.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.187
So, how much have you told him?

25:17.475 --> 25:20.101
I mean, about David and Frobisher.

25:22.426 --> 25:23.927
We've talked about it.

25:24.298 --> 25:26.133
You know, things come up in group.

25:26.175 --> 25:28.651
'Cause I don't want to say
something that I shouldn't.

25:29.653 --> 25:30.794
Well, then, don't.

25:32.670 --> 25:33.435
Right.

25:35.541 --> 25:36.610
Ellen, seriously,

25:36.922 --> 25:39.361
- if you don't want me to go...
- No, Katie, it's fine.

25:39.805 --> 25:40.611
I promise.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.071
No, no, no,
you're not going to go shy on us.

25:49.235 --> 25:50.883
Oh, look, that was a one-time thing.

25:51.009 --> 25:53.261
That's bullshit.
You do it at the drop of a hat.

25:55.176 --> 25:56.646
All right, so drop a hat.

25:56.877 --> 25:57.639
Just one.

25:57.862 --> 26:00.293
Michael! Bring down the keyboard.

26:01.301 --> 26:02.601
I'll go get him.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.126
That's my man.

26:06.112 --> 26:07.813
Okay, Dave, this one's for you.

26:07.855 --> 26:09.067
What's it going to be?

26:10.612 --> 26:11.486
"Danny Boy".

26:12.017 --> 26:13.112
Are you serious?

26:13.721 --> 26:15.030
It's a family favorite.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.301
I used to do it
at Brown with the Jabberwocks.

26:17.881 --> 26:20.119
Try to imagine me in gray
flannels and white bucks.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.304
You ready, Michael?

26:45.374 --> 26:47.296
And to think his company has

26:47.338 --> 26:50.467
a $4 billion market capitalization.

26:52.242 --> 26:53.492
All these guys.

26:54.429 --> 26:55.815
To the manner born.

27:01.492 --> 27:02.742
What about you?

27:04.990 --> 27:07.721
My dad smelted steel for 37 years.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.401
Cheers.

27:14.939 --> 27:15.768
Thanks.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.807
You and Sam Arsenault still
partnering in your...

27:24.528 --> 27:25.807
charity foundation?

27:25.849 --> 27:26.551
Yes.

27:30.923 --> 27:32.233
What do you think of him?

27:32.429 --> 27:34.083
I think he's a terrific guy,

27:34.780 --> 27:36.446
but you have to watch out.

27:37.243 --> 27:38.343
Why is that?

27:39.330 --> 27:41.756
Because,
when you peel away all his...

27:42.369 --> 27:45.191
glad-handing, honey-voiced charm,

27:45.233 --> 27:47.324
what's left is an entitled brat

27:47.588 --> 27:49.714
who considers himself
above the rules.

27:51.012 --> 27:53.781
He'll tell you exactly
what you want to hear,

27:53.823 --> 27:56.215
and then turn around
and stab you in the back.

28:01.822 --> 28:03.060
Good to know.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.598
You boys seem all worked up.
Where is the fire?

28:20.640 --> 28:23.034
Why is there no record of all
the reports we've submitted?

28:23.118 --> 28:24.245
Excuse me?

28:24.724 --> 28:26.519
We want to know
why we don't have clearance

28:26.561 --> 28:28.573
to the case file
for this investigation.

28:31.114 --> 28:32.400
You mean this case file?

28:34.373 --> 28:36.579
The investigation is
strictly need-to-know.

28:36.621 --> 28:37.486
Since when?

28:37.666 --> 28:39.857
Since the deputy
director said it was.

28:40.501 --> 28:41.218
Why?

28:41.310 --> 28:43.153
The Bureau has made this
case a top priority,

28:43.195 --> 28:46.018
which means it can make
or break a career, my career.

28:46.060 --> 28:49.013
So stop whing and go out
and get me something on Patty Hewes.

28:54.374 --> 28:55.476
You like Idaho?

28:55.518 --> 28:56.978
I think it's our best bet.

28:57.337 --> 28:59.127
Is the plant manager
willing to play ball?

28:59.169 --> 29:00.049
Definitely.

29:00.658 --> 29:02.144
I spoke to my meteorologist.

29:03.013 --> 29:06.287
He's predicting a foot of snow.
Should be a big demand for home heating.

29:07.250 --> 29:10.873
Once we shut down supply, there should
be a pretty healthy spike in price.

29:11.646 --> 29:13.205
Unless the storm shifts north.

29:13.247 --> 29:14.837
Yeah, there's always that risk,

29:15.750 --> 29:17.422
but I still think
that's the way to go.

29:19.305 --> 29:21.065
You usually give me more options.

29:22.983 --> 29:24.513
You usually give me more time.

29:26.671 --> 29:27.599
Fine.

29:28.052 --> 29:28.845
Idaho.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.423
Let me know
when they plan to go off-line.

29:31.925 --> 29:32.770
Will do.

29:37.151 --> 29:41.047
Before Finn and I were arrested
that night, he made a stop.

29:41.912 --> 29:45.191
He got out of our car
and went into an SUV.

29:45.493 --> 29:46.791
Was he meeting someone?

29:47.317 --> 29:49.008
No. There was no one else there.

29:49.203 --> 29:50.913
Finn had his own set of keys.

29:51.716 --> 29:53.458
- What was he doing?
- I don't know.

29:54.335 --> 29:57.686
He sat in the SUV
for a couple of minutes.

29:58.070 --> 30:00.208
When he got back to our car,
we drove off.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.758
Did you see what kind of SUV it was?

30:03.062 --> 30:04.359
A Cadillac, I think.

30:04.551 --> 30:05.761
You know, the big one.

30:06.504 --> 30:09.650
What was Mr. Garrety's
state of mind at the time?

30:09.692 --> 30:11.559
Did he seem anxious?

30:12.817 --> 30:15.480
When he's coked up,
it's a little hard to tell.

30:16.701 --> 30:18.941
Is there anything
else you can remember?

30:20.188 --> 30:21.293
That's all I saw.

30:24.512 --> 30:25.545
Okay, Lonnie.

30:27.299 --> 30:28.601
Thank you for coming in.

30:29.028 --> 30:29.991
Yeah, sure.

30:31.613 --> 30:34.436
I had a nice chat with
your family court judge.

30:35.493 --> 30:37.919
I think you'll find he's
sympathetic to joint custody.

30:39.722 --> 30:40.928
Thank you, Ms. Hewes.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.251
What's your verdict
on Sam Arsenault?

31:12.665 --> 31:13.621
He's got pipes.

31:13.933 --> 31:15.050
Hell of a singer.

31:16.071 --> 31:17.379
And for the position?

31:18.758 --> 31:22.556
I want to thank you for making
the introduction, but, truth be told,

31:22.911 --> 31:24.757
we're leaning
in a different direction now.

31:25.270 --> 31:26.468
More conservative?

31:27.930 --> 31:28.999
More you.

31:31.761 --> 31:33.098
You're a brilliant manager.

31:34.518 --> 31:35.643
I don't know, Dave.

31:36.006 --> 31:39.535
Phil, you and I grew up in finance,
and we both made a mint.

31:40.323 --> 31:42.919
But I didn't get to where I am
now until I went to Washington.

31:42.961 --> 31:44.828
- And where is that?
- Connected.

31:47.254 --> 31:49.135
I don't see myself
in the government.

31:50.974 --> 31:52.115
Then do what I did.

31:52.422 --> 31:54.709
Stay for a year or two and jump
back into the private sector.

31:54.751 --> 31:57.490
- I hate politics. You know that.
- Yeah, but a decision like this

31:57.532 --> 31:58.889
isn't about politics.

31:59.889 --> 32:01.078
It's about power.

32:01.559 --> 32:02.945
Influence.

32:03.913 --> 32:05.691
You're rich, Phil, but what's next?

32:11.074 --> 32:12.305
Will you kick it around?

32:13.659 --> 32:14.716
I'll consider it,

32:14.958 --> 32:17.586
- but I'm not making any promises.
- Understood. Understood.

32:22.754 --> 32:24.782
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Ms. Hewes. Have a seat.

32:24.824 --> 32:25.840
No, thank you.

32:26.826 --> 32:29.108
I'm here to tell you
that I hold the FBI

32:29.150 --> 32:31.679
responsible
for the death of Pete McKee.

32:32.940 --> 32:35.659
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what you're referring to.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.651
Bullshit.

32:37.861 --> 32:41.372
And you can tell who's ever calling the
shots in Washington that I'm on to them.

32:42.272 --> 32:45.087
The Bureau may be watching me,
but I'm also watching you.

32:46.088 --> 32:48.468
Ma'am, I understand you're upset,
but right about now,

32:48.648 --> 32:50.384
you're gonna want
to check your tone.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.428
This investigation is corrupt,

32:57.470 --> 32:59.951
and when I prove it,
your career will be over.

33:00.863 --> 33:02.605
You don't want to threaten me.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.888
I don't make threats, Mr. McGraff.

33:05.865 --> 33:06.738
This is war.

33:13.099 --> 33:14.914
Patty Hewes came to see me.

33:18.889 --> 33:20.258
What do you want me to do?

33:22.192 --> 33:23.450
Forgive my place.

33:23.655 --> 33:25.240
Still putting it together.

33:27.077 --> 33:28.604
Sort of in-between gigs right now.

33:28.826 --> 33:31.028
Me, too. I totally get it.
Thanks.

33:31.497 --> 33:33.659
So, you were saying...

33:34.848 --> 33:36.597
You were asking about
grief counseling.

33:36.781 --> 33:39.285
Yeah, I was wondering
why you never went.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.327
I'm not really into group therapy.

33:41.605 --> 33:43.455
I see my own therapist.

33:43.875 --> 33:44.739
Makes sense.

33:48.152 --> 33:49.489
Can I ask you something?

33:51.071 --> 33:52.697
This sounds ominous.

33:52.988 --> 33:54.699
You know, it's none of my business.

33:55.919 --> 33:56.701
What?

33:57.913 --> 33:59.197
It's not appropriate.

34:00.075 --> 34:00.813
What?

34:04.287 --> 34:07.336
I know Ellen thinks that
Arthur Frobisher had something to do

34:07.421 --> 34:08.779
with your brother's death.

34:10.101 --> 34:11.132
Do you think that?

34:11.268 --> 34:12.425
I know he did.

34:12.768 --> 34:14.300
Why not go to the police?

34:14.385 --> 34:16.637
Because Frobisher has got
the police in his pocket.

34:17.007 --> 34:17.777
So,

34:18.774 --> 34:21.014
you believe Ellen's
whole conspiracy theory.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.606
Oh, it's not just a theory.

34:23.164 --> 34:24.962
When Patty Hewes took
on Frobisher's case,

34:25.004 --> 34:26.856
she got all
of his financial records.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.351
From the shareholder thing.

34:28.393 --> 34:29.094
Yeah.

34:30.626 --> 34:33.641
Frobisher uses this private security
firm which employs

34:33.929 --> 34:35.406
off-duty officers.

34:35.893 --> 34:37.408
You think one of them did it?

34:41.808 --> 34:43.998
You know what,
I'd really rather not talk about this.

34:44.081 --> 34:44.976
I'm sorry.

34:45.018 --> 34:46.911
- I shouldn't even brought it up.
- It's fine.

34:46.954 --> 34:50.125
It's just that Ellen thinks about it
all the time, and I worry about her.

34:53.514 --> 34:54.607
I understand.

34:56.168 --> 34:57.010
So,

34:57.959 --> 34:59.138
Chinese, Italian?

34:59.940 --> 35:02.595
There's a very good Brazilian
place like a block from here.

35:04.264 --> 35:06.060
Wes, why did you call me?

35:06.827 --> 35:07.932
What do you mean?

35:08.731 --> 35:11.349
It's obvious that you're
not actually into me.

35:13.956 --> 35:15.296
What are you talking about?

35:17.800 --> 35:19.113
You want to be with Ellen.

36:38.539 --> 36:39.957
Is everything okay?

36:40.557 --> 36:41.338
Yeah.

36:41.587 --> 36:42.779
Everything's fine.

36:46.611 --> 36:48.457
Katie said she called off your date.

37:33.401 --> 37:34.747
You talked to Katie Connor?

37:35.329 --> 37:36.104
Yeah.

37:36.469 --> 37:38.631
Ellen Parsons knows
about the security firm.

37:40.805 --> 37:41.886
She tell you that?

37:42.643 --> 37:44.529
Patty Hewes connected Frobisher

37:44.571 --> 37:47.099
to Calder Protective Services
when he was her plaintiff.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.681
They also think a cop
murdered David Connor.

37:52.630 --> 37:54.466
They suspect anyone in particular?

37:54.708 --> 37:55.852
Not that I know of.

37:59.790 --> 38:01.027
Look, what are we doing?

38:02.700 --> 38:04.448
Ellen Parsons is getting closer.

38:05.391 --> 38:07.342
Ellen doesn't even know you exist.

38:09.715 --> 38:10.744
Take her out.

38:11.635 --> 38:12.422
What?

38:12.866 --> 38:14.367
Make it look like an accident.

38:16.890 --> 38:18.679
Do it, and you're done.
