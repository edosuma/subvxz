01:00.510 --> 01:03.245
__

01:09.453 --> 01:11.253
Everyone, everyone!

01:11.288 --> 01:13.055
What's the ker-bubble, Ono?

01:13.090 --> 01:14.390
There's trouble
with the zebras!

01:14.424 --> 01:16.292
Oh, what else is new?

01:16.326 --> 01:18.027
And the gazelles!

01:18.061 --> 01:20.296
The zebras and the gazelles
are in trouble?

01:20.330 --> 01:23.399
No, they are the trouble!
They're fighting each other!

01:23.433 --> 01:25.468
Zebras and gazelles
don't fight.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.337
You seein' okay, Ono?
Look. How many fingers?

01:28.371 --> 01:30.106
I know what I saw!

01:30.140 --> 01:32.475
If the zebras and gazelles
really are fighting,

01:32.509 --> 01:34.210
we better check it out.

01:34.244 --> 01:38.047
- Till the Pride Lands end...
<i>- Lion Guard defend!</i>

01:44.187 --> 01:45.254
So weird.

01:45.288 --> 01:48.124
I've never seen zebras
and gazelles act like this.

01:48.158 --> 01:50.259
Hey, wait. I know these herds!

01:50.293 --> 01:55.231
Those zebras follow Muhimu.
And the gazelles follow Swala.

01:55.265 --> 01:58.234
But Muhimu and
Swala are friends!

01:58.268 --> 02:00.369
Something's not right. Ono!

02:00.403 --> 02:04.440
- Can you see Muhimu and Swala?
- Affirmative!

02:04.474 --> 02:07.243
Looks like they're
in the middle of everything.

02:07.277 --> 02:09.377
Then that's where
we're going! Come on!

02:12.082 --> 02:14.116
Let's move, zebra-deebras!

02:14.151 --> 02:18.387
Black with white stripes on one side.
White with black stipes on the other!

02:20.090 --> 02:22.458
'Scuse me, guys.
I think I can handle this.

02:22.492 --> 02:25.294
<i> Twende kiboko!</i>

02:25.328 --> 02:26.295
Whoa!

02:27.464 --> 02:29.098
Thanks, Beshte.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.066
Uh-oh!

02:31.334 --> 02:32.334
Wha...

02:33.170 --> 02:35.271
Uh, hello?

02:35.305 --> 02:37.406
Ew. That's gotta hurt.

02:38.542 --> 02:41.043
Nice move, Muhimu!

02:41.077 --> 02:44.146
What do you mean, nice move?
You pushed me!

02:44.181 --> 02:46.315
So? What are you
going to do about it?

02:48.552 --> 02:50.419
I know whose side I'm on.

02:50.453 --> 02:51.520
I heard that!

02:52.455 --> 02:55.191
Muhimu! Swala! Stop! Hey...

02:55.225 --> 02:56.392
Enough!

02:58.161 --> 03:00.996
What's going on?
Swala, Muhimu.

03:01.031 --> 03:03.998
- I thought you two were friends!
- We were,

03:04.033 --> 03:07.203
until Swala and the gazelles
tried to steal our grazing grounds!

03:07.237 --> 03:11.473
Your grazing grounds? Muhimu,
these are our grazing grounds!

03:11.508 --> 03:14.343
Ha, no, they're ours!

03:14.377 --> 03:17.379
But this is the Pride Lands.
Can't you just share?

03:17.414 --> 03:21.050
Beshte's right. These grazing
grounds are for everyone.

03:21.084 --> 03:23.485
There's plenty of grass
for zebras and gazelles.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.221
Um, Kion...

03:25.255 --> 03:27.089
That's not exactly true...

03:27.123 --> 03:30.092
Except for where you are,
I only see dirt!

03:30.126 --> 03:33.162
- There's no other grass at all?
- Seriously?

03:33.196 --> 03:37.199
Wait. So you zebras and gazelles
aren't really mad at each other.

03:37.234 --> 03:38.300
You're just hungry!

03:38.335 --> 03:41.170
I do get cranky
when I'm hungry.

03:41.204 --> 03:44.073
And now you see
why we're hungry.

03:44.107 --> 03:46.108
There's not enough grass!

03:46.142 --> 03:49.445
Well, then we just need to find a
place with enough grass for all of you.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.512
Can you do that?

03:50.547 --> 03:53.349
Yes, where is all this grass?

03:53.383 --> 03:56.385
I don't know...
But I know who will!

03:56.419 --> 03:58.520
Hmm. I knew the herds
were large this year,

03:58.555 --> 04:02.091
but I didn't realize they'd
outgrown their grazing grounds.

04:02.125 --> 04:06.161
Isn't there somewhere with enough
grass for the herds to share?

04:06.196 --> 04:08.430
Kion, you see that
patch of green,

04:08.465 --> 04:10.432
far out in the distance?

04:10.467 --> 04:12.334
Mbali Fields?

04:12.369 --> 04:17.206
Mbali Fields. That's where the zebras
and gazelles can find their grass.

04:17.240 --> 04:22.011
But that's at the very edge of the
Pride Lands. You think they can make it?

04:22.045 --> 04:26.115
I'm certain they can. Because I'm
sending the Lion Guard with them.

04:26.149 --> 04:29.051
You want me to
lead a migration?

04:29.085 --> 04:32.254
You'll have the rest of the Guard
with you. But I know you, Kion.

04:32.289 --> 04:35.124
You can do whatever
you put your mind to.

04:35.158 --> 04:37.393
Thanks, Dad.
I won't let you down.

04:37.427 --> 04:39.028
You never do.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.900
Who's ready for a Savannah trip?

04:44.901 --> 04:47.436
Raise your hooves! Whoo!

04:47.470 --> 04:50.439
- Oh. It's you.
- Have we met?

04:50.473 --> 04:55.377
Uh, yeah. You sat on me
yesterday? Remember?

04:55.412 --> 04:59.315
I don't have the slightest idea what
you're talking about, little mongoose.

04:59.349 --> 05:03.419
- Mongoose? I'm a honey badger!
- Whatever.

05:03.453 --> 05:05.354
When are we getting
this show on the road?

05:05.388 --> 05:09.992
I need to get to the grazing
grounds. Before it is time.

05:10.026 --> 05:14.029
"It is time"?
Don't get all Rafiki on me, Muhimu.

05:14.064 --> 05:17.199
We're almost ready to go.
Just keep your stripes on.

05:19.469 --> 05:21.303
Looks like everyone's ready, Kion.

05:21.338 --> 05:24.440
- Great. Did you scout us the best route?
- Affirmative.

05:24.474 --> 05:27.076
Through the plains
past Maji Baridi Falls,

05:27.110 --> 05:30.412
down Rocky Ridge, then right
through the canyon to Mbali Fields.

05:30.447 --> 05:32.081
Pretty simple, really.

05:32.115 --> 05:34.083
I was hoping you'd say that.

05:34.117 --> 05:35.351
Listen up, everybody!

05:35.385 --> 05:38.053
It's a long way
to Mbali Fields.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.323
But I'll do my best to get
you all there safe and sound!

05:41.358 --> 05:43.058
We know you will!

05:43.093 --> 05:45.461
We trust you, Kion!
Right, everyone?

05:47.297 --> 05:49.198
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

05:49.232 --> 05:53.035
Uh, thanks.
Well, let's move out!

05:53.069 --> 05:55.471
- Ono, point the way!
- Affirmative!

- How's it look from above, Ono?
- So far so good.

07:04.407 --> 07:07.076
Though it seems like
everyone's slowing down.

07:07.110 --> 07:09.244
I'd better give 'em
some encouragement.

07:09.279 --> 07:13.215
Hey, everyone! I know you're tired
and I know you're hungry but...

07:13.249 --> 07:15.317
We were hungry
when we started!

07:15.351 --> 07:17.186
Now we're starving!

07:17.220 --> 07:22.458
It's not much farther, I promise.
We'll get to Mbali Fields soon!

07:22.492 --> 07:26.459
- We will get to Mbali Fields soon, right?
- Affirmative.

07:26.494 --> 07:30.065
We just have to go down this
steep slope and through the canyon.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.034
You can see the Fields
from here.

07:32.068 --> 07:35.471
I just hope we get there
before the storm hits.

07:35.505 --> 07:39.341
We're almost there, everyone! See the
patch of green at the end of the canyon?

07:39.375 --> 07:42.044
Look at all that grass.

07:42.078 --> 07:45.247
I can almost taste
it from here. Oh, yummy!

07:45.281 --> 07:49.318
Yummy? You know it's gonna
taste like grass, right?

07:49.352 --> 07:55.057
Yes! I can't wait.
In fact, I can't wait!

07:55.091 --> 07:57.092
Whoa! Muhimu?

07:57.127 --> 08:01.230
Out of my way!
I'm coming, grass! I'm coming!

08:01.264 --> 08:04.066
Great idea!
Let's go eat!

08:04.100 --> 08:06.068
Uh-oh.

08:06.102 --> 08:10.172
Everyone! Slow down!
The slope is too steep.

08:12.308 --> 08:15.043
No way this ends well.

08:15.078 --> 08:18.180
What are we waiting for?
Let's run!

08:18.214 --> 08:20.249
Lion Guard, we gotta stop them!

08:20.283 --> 08:21.383
Meet you at the
front of the herd.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.384
<i> Huwezi!</i>

08:34.097 --> 08:35.197
<i> Hapana!</i>

08:35.231 --> 08:37.198
Kion? We have a problem!

08:39.202 --> 08:40.402
I'm on it!

08:44.073 --> 08:45.274
Everyone, stop!

08:48.144 --> 08:50.279
Back! Run back, now!

08:58.454 --> 09:01.323
Why did you shove me?

09:01.357 --> 09:03.425
Don't you know
I'm in a family way?

09:03.459 --> 09:05.427
No, you were in
the rocks' way!

09:05.461 --> 09:07.396
I was trying to
save your life!

09:07.430 --> 09:10.265
Oh. Well, that's different.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.202
Now, could you please get up?
You're sitting on me!

09:13.236 --> 09:16.138
Well, now you know how it feels!

09:17.173 --> 09:19.174
What's that supposed to mean?

09:19.209 --> 09:22.277
Oh, never mind.
Odd little hedgehog.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.413
I'm a honey badger!

09:27.050 --> 09:28.450
Guess we're not as
close as we thought.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.252
What do we do now, Kion?

09:30.286 --> 09:32.321
Well, the herds
can't go over it.

09:32.355 --> 09:36.291
And we can't go through it.
So we've got to go around it.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.361
Ono. Scout out another route
to the grazing grounds.

09:39.395 --> 09:41.430
I'm on it.

09:41.464 --> 09:43.298
I blame the zebras for this.

09:51.140 --> 09:52.374
Oh, no.

09:54.210 --> 09:55.344
Any luck?

09:55.378 --> 09:58.447
Well, I did find another
route to the grazing grounds.

09:58.481 --> 10:01.483
- That's great!
- But it goes through the Outlands.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.086
That's not so great.

10:04.120 --> 10:07.122
I promised my dad we'd get
these herds to their new home.

10:07.156 --> 10:09.424
And if we have to go through
the Outlands to get there,

10:09.459 --> 10:11.326
then that's what
we're going to do.

10:11.361 --> 10:15.130
At least we've got one thing going
for us. That storm hasn't started yet.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.371
Maybe I shouldn't have
said that out loud.

10:27.076 --> 10:30.078
I'm starting to wonder if Kion
knows what he's doing.

10:30.113 --> 10:34.516
He says we're almost there, now he's
taking us in a different direction!

10:34.550 --> 10:37.252
Has he ever even led a migration?

10:37.287 --> 10:39.288
Maybe we should've stayed home.

10:39.322 --> 10:42.291
If Simba had brought us,
we'd be there by now.

10:42.325 --> 10:45.127
I'm not sure Kion can
handle a trip like this.

10:46.329 --> 10:50.198
Is it just me
or is this water getting deeper?

10:54.504 --> 10:58.073
Oh, no. Kion, look out!

10:58.107 --> 10:59.207
Flash flood!

11:02.111 --> 11:04.246
Higher ground, everyone! Move!

11:09.485 --> 11:12.387
No animal gets lost! Let's go!

11:12.422 --> 11:15.157
Ono, keep these animals
on safer ground!

11:15.191 --> 11:16.358
We'll get the others!

11:16.392 --> 11:18.293
You got it!

11:18.328 --> 11:22.331
Zebras! Gazelles!
This way! Uphill!

11:23.366 --> 11:25.300
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

11:25.335 --> 11:27.035
I'm coming, zebras!

11:32.408 --> 11:34.476
Help! Help!

11:49.492 --> 11:51.259
Not gonna lose you, gazelle.

11:52.261 --> 11:53.362
Oof!

11:55.465 --> 11:57.399
Thank you, Fuli.

11:57.433 --> 11:59.134
Kion!

11:59.168 --> 12:01.403
Don't panic, Swala!
I'll get you!

12:01.437 --> 12:02.471
Here we go!

12:02.505 --> 12:04.373
Whoa!

12:11.280 --> 12:13.181
Help! Help me!

12:13.216 --> 12:15.217
Muhimu! I'm coming!

12:15.251 --> 12:16.485
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

12:19.088 --> 12:20.255
Gotcha, Muhimu!

12:20.289 --> 12:23.325
You've got me?
You're the size of my head!

12:23.359 --> 12:25.427
Then it's a good thing
you've got a big head!

12:27.096 --> 12:30.365
Muhimu, work with me here!

12:30.400 --> 12:34.336
I'm trying, but it's hard!
I'm swimming for two!

12:34.370 --> 12:39.040
I'm the one swimming for two!
Now help me out and paddle!

12:44.147 --> 12:49.117
Well, now that you've saved me
twice, I suppose I should admit it.

12:49.152 --> 12:50.419
I did sit on you.

12:50.453 --> 12:54.222
Yeah! I've still got the
stripe marks to prove it.

12:54.257 --> 12:58.193
Anyway, I'm sorry.
And, thank you.

12:58.227 --> 13:02.230
<i> Hakuna matata. Come on.
We have to get to higher ground.</i>

13:06.169 --> 13:09.070
And who takes the
low ground during a rainstorm?

13:09.105 --> 13:13.108
Yes, he saved me, but it's his fault I
was in trouble in the first place, right?

13:19.248 --> 13:23.318
So, um, Kion, what now?

13:25.154 --> 13:26.388
Kion?

13:26.422 --> 13:29.090
I don't know.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.293
Keep an eye on the herds.
I'll be back.

13:37.166 --> 13:40.435
Kion, something's
troubling you.

13:40.470 --> 13:43.438
Grandfather, I don't
know what to do.

13:43.473 --> 13:46.074
Dad trusted me to
lead the herds.

13:46.108 --> 13:48.276
But everything went wrong.

13:48.311 --> 13:51.446
And now they all think
I'm a bad leader.

13:51.481 --> 13:54.216
And I think they
might be right.

13:54.250 --> 13:59.054
Kion, don't let their lack
of faith affect yours.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.456
I really do want them
to trust me.

14:01.491 --> 14:06.361
They will. As long
as you trust yourself.

14:06.395 --> 14:12.033
Confidence, Kion. That's all you
need to complete this journey.

14:12.068 --> 14:15.437
But confidence doesn't come
from what others think about you.

14:15.471 --> 14:18.406
It comes from inside yourself.

14:20.409 --> 14:22.344
Thank you, Grandfather.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.019
You think Kion's gonna be okay?

14:31.053 --> 14:32.420
Sure he is! He's Kion!

14:32.455 --> 14:34.489
Hey, guys!

14:34.524 --> 14:38.226
The herds have been talking,
and we're not happy.

14:38.261 --> 14:42.397
You promised us the trip would end in a
huge field with enough grass for everyone.

14:42.431 --> 14:46.167
We're not there yet.
It's taking longer than we thought.

14:46.202 --> 14:49.104
But I know we'll make it.
Trust me.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.372
I'm not sure I do.

14:50.406 --> 14:53.208
Me, neither!
I'm with Swala!

14:53.242 --> 14:54.509
Well, I trust Kion!

14:54.544 --> 14:56.278
So do I!

14:56.312 --> 14:59.180
I agree. The trip hasn't gone
the way we hoped.

14:59.215 --> 15:01.283
But it's not Kion's fault!

15:02.218 --> 15:04.152
Part of it was mine.

15:04.186 --> 15:07.022
We all know I started
the stampede.

15:07.056 --> 15:10.025
If I hadn't, we wouldn't have
had to change course.

15:10.059 --> 15:13.094
And who can predict
a flash flood?

15:13.129 --> 15:17.265
But Kion and the Lion Guard got
us through it safe and sound.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.434
I have faith in you, Kion.

15:19.468 --> 15:24.239
And, and I promise to make
things easier from now on,

15:24.273 --> 15:25.373
not harder.

15:25.408 --> 15:27.108
Thanks, Muhimu.

15:29.111 --> 15:31.479
There's a whole new life
for you at Mbali Fields.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.249
Now we have to cut
through the Outlands.

15:34.283 --> 15:37.385
I won't lie. There
are predators there.

15:37.420 --> 15:40.952
But you're with the Lion Guard,
and we'll keep you safe.

15:40.987 --> 15:45.060
That's a promise!
We will keep you safe!

15:45.094 --> 15:46.227
So, who's ready?

15:46.262 --> 15:48.096
- I am.
- Me too.

15:48.130 --> 15:49.331
Let's do it.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.335
You'll keep me safe, right?

15:53.369 --> 15:56.104
'Course I will!
What are friends for?

15:56.138 --> 15:58.200
- We're friends?
- Sure!

15:58.235 --> 16:00.976
As long as you promise
not to sit on me again.

16:01.010 --> 16:02.344
This way, everyone!

16:08.217 --> 16:11.219
Remember, everybody.
We're in the Outlands now.

16:11.253 --> 16:14.122
Be as quiet as you can.
Got it?

16:14.156 --> 16:15.290
But what if...

16:15.324 --> 16:18.497
Shh! Kion said to be...

16:18.532 --> 16:22.263
- It's time!
- Yeah! Time to stay quiet!

16:22.298 --> 16:25.467
No! Time for the baby!

16:25.501 --> 16:30.238
- What baby?
- The baby I'm about to have!

16:30.272 --> 16:34.275
Baby? You're having a baby?
Like a baby baby?

16:34.310 --> 16:36.180
Like a baby, baby, baby?

16:36.512 --> 16:38.279
Why didn't you tell me?

16:38.314 --> 16:41.082
I've been telling you the whole
time, you silly honey badger.

16:41.117 --> 16:44.219
Yes! I'm a honey badg...

16:44.253 --> 16:46.488
You're having a baby!

16:48.257 --> 16:50.258
Now who's not being quiet?

16:50.292 --> 16:53.094
You're having a baby?
Right now?

16:54.497 --> 16:56.164
- What do we do?
- Wha...?

16:56.198 --> 16:59.100
- How should I know?
- I only know about eggs.

16:59.135 --> 17:02.370
Leave it to us. She'll need
help, ladies. Who's with me?

17:05.074 --> 17:06.441
She'll want some privacy.

17:06.474 --> 17:08.443
Uh, no problems.
See you later!

17:08.477 --> 17:10.045
Wait!

17:10.079 --> 17:13.248
Actually, I'll feel safer
if you're nearby.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.349
You saved me before.

17:15.384 --> 17:18.386
I wouldn't be here to have
this baby if it weren't for you.

17:18.421 --> 17:20.387
Really? Okay!

17:20.423 --> 17:25.126
Um... How "nearby"
do I have to be?

17:25.161 --> 17:29.097
Uh-oh! Here we go!

17:30.032 --> 17:32.233
Not too nearby, then. Good.

17:32.268 --> 17:37.038
A baby zebra?
It's gonna be so cute!

17:37.073 --> 17:38.752
But we're in the Outlands.

17:38.753 --> 17:42.110
There's predators everywhere!
She can't have the baby here!

17:44.080 --> 17:46.247
She can and she is!

17:46.282 --> 17:49.084
Then we're gonna have to
stay here till she's had it.

17:49.118 --> 17:53.054
No. Fuli's right. There's
a lot of predators out here.

17:53.089 --> 17:56.257
If we want to keep everyone
safe, we need to split up.

17:56.292 --> 17:59.360
You three take the herds to
the new grazing grounds.

17:59.395 --> 18:01.396
I'll stay here with
Bunga and Muhimu.

18:01.430 --> 18:05.066
No! What if there's an attack?
You'll need our help!

18:05.101 --> 18:08.203
What I need is to protect
the Circle of Life.

18:08.237 --> 18:11.406
That means taking care of
this baby and the herds.

18:13.075 --> 18:16.077
Fuli. You know it's
the right thing to do.

18:16.112 --> 18:18.313
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.081
Wouldn't expect you to.

18:20.116 --> 18:21.382
See you at the
grazing grounds.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.218
Come on, everyone.

18:25.488 --> 18:28.156
Um, how you doin' Muhimu?

18:28.190 --> 18:31.126
Muhimu? Everything okay?

18:33.229 --> 18:35.196
Hey, that's pretty good!

18:35.231 --> 18:38.166
You made your voice
sound just like a...

18:38.200 --> 18:42.036
A baby! Your baby! It's here!

18:47.243 --> 18:49.410
Oh, it's a boy.

18:49.445 --> 18:51.045
<i>Whoa.</i>

18:51.080 --> 18:52.313
Wow. Look at that.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.217
He's pretty cute.
Does he do anything?

18:56.252 --> 18:57.452
Like what?

18:57.486 --> 19:00.421
I dunno. Like play?
Or tell jokes?

19:06.328 --> 19:08.296
Ha! Did you hear that?

19:08.330 --> 19:11.366
Yeah. Sounded like a snack!

19:11.400 --> 19:15.403
A whole pack of snacks!
A snack pack!

19:17.139 --> 19:21.309
That's not all, Janja. Kion
and Bunga are down there, too!

19:21.343 --> 19:25.246
So what? When we run in,
they're gonna protect the baby.

19:25.281 --> 19:30.084
But the big zebras and the
gazelle are gonna panic and run.

19:30.119 --> 19:31.319
Oh yeah!

19:31.353 --> 19:34.389
Zebras always do that!

19:34.423 --> 19:37.392
And then we can pick 'em off
without even thinkin'!

19:37.426 --> 19:42.130
Without thinking? Good!
That's how we do everything!

19:44.233 --> 19:47.101
That was really cool,
but a little loud.

19:47.136 --> 19:50.305
Not your fault, you're weren't born yet
when Kion told us to be quiet, but...

19:50.339 --> 19:52.407
Okay, zebras!
Better run!

19:52.441 --> 19:55.276
'Cause here we come!

19:55.311 --> 19:56.444
Hyenas!

19:58.180 --> 20:00.381
Panic and run! Panic and run!

20:00.416 --> 20:04.352
No! That's just what they want!
We have to stick together!

20:04.386 --> 20:07.322
Circle around Muhimu
and the baby! Now!

20:07.356 --> 20:11.092
Everyone! Stop running
and listen to Kion!

20:13.395 --> 20:14.362
Thanks.

20:16.065 --> 20:17.265
Now circle up!

20:21.337 --> 20:25.406
What's the matter, zebras?
Not gonna run? Don't we scare you?

20:25.441 --> 20:30.378
- Whoo!
- Oogie boogie boogie!

20:30.412 --> 20:34.082
Forget it, Janja. We're not
making it easy for you.

20:34.116 --> 20:36.217
You'll have to
deal with all of us.

20:36.252 --> 20:37.518
Our pleasure.

20:39.388 --> 20:41.189
<i>Zuka zama!</i>

20:43.092 --> 20:45.360
Janja, time for you to g...

20:53.435 --> 20:55.236
Hmm?

20:55.271 --> 20:57.105
Ooh!

20:57.139 --> 20:58.106
Oof!

21:00.142 --> 21:01.342
Beat it, Janja!

21:01.377 --> 21:04.445
Yeah, yeah.
I don't even like zebra, anyway!

21:04.480 --> 21:06.481
Yeah, it's too chewy!

21:06.515 --> 21:09.350
Yeah, and too... stripy!

21:09.385 --> 21:10.385
Hey!

21:10.419 --> 21:14.255
Bunga, did you see him?
He kicked that hyena!

21:14.290 --> 21:17.492
- He saved my life!
- I don't know much about babies,

21:17.526 --> 21:20.461
but that's a pretty cool
kid you've got there.

21:29.338 --> 21:31.339
All present and accounted for!

21:31.373 --> 21:35.143
The Mbali Fields migration
is officially over!

21:36.278 --> 21:38.112
Nothing went the way
we thought it would,

21:38.147 --> 21:40.348
but we still got
everyone here safe.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.725
- And that's what counts.
- We even added one.

21:45.354 --> 21:47.288
Welcome to the Circle of Life.

21:50.259 --> 21:53.862
You said it, baby!
