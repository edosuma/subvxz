You got it.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.676
- What’s up, Conner?
- Hey, pop this wardrobe.

00:12.763 --> 00:16.051
Don’t want a flare-up
dragging us back out here

Order in successful societies
depends upon enforced rules.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.450
[ Booth ] People can do the
right thing left on their own.
No, history shows othenNise.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.456
A weak government
will always spawn
mutiny and rebellion.

You don’t believe
in human decency
under any circumstances.

00:49.050 --> 00:52.542
Not as a means of
controlling a population, no.
The result would be anarchy.

00:52.637 --> 00:55.549
Have to say I agree
with the pretty lady
on this one.

of the law, we’re animals.

Thank you for comin’ out here.
[ Brennan ]
What caused the fire?

01:01.145 --> 01:04.637
Well, it could be arson.
The fire boys say the y dldn ’I
find any sign of an accelerant.

01:04.774 --> 01:08.392
The source of the flame
looks like a lit candle.
Was someone killed?

01:08.486 --> 01:10.818
Well, that’s
why we asked
for you people.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.237
Oh-ho!

01:14.325 --> 01:18.068
Whoa. Okay.
Is that real, Bones?

01:20.498 --> 01:24.116
The bones were already
dry and de-fleshed
prior to the fire.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.747
The victim was elder/y,
female.

01:26.837 --> 01:30.329
- Oh.
- Oh? Wait. You usually
don’t say “Oh.”

01:30.424 --> 01:33.791
- It was an indication of my surprise.
- Well, I know that. But why?

01:33.886 --> 01:36.047
The bones have been
re-articulated.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.594
Is that bad?

01:37.682 --> 01:40.594
The skeleton
has been reassembled,
quite amateurishly.

01:40.685 --> 01:43.643
See how the right ulna
has been placed
with the left radius?

01:43.729 --> 01:45.811
Yeah. That’s shoddy.
That’s shoddy work.

01:45.898 --> 01:48.435
- Hey, guys.
- [Booth] Yeah.

01:48.526 --> 01:51.233
Hodgins noticed that there’s a path
all the way around the house.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.231
And Angela noticed
that it was a circle.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.233
Looks like it acted
as a firebreak.

The East, right?

03:07.480 --> 03:09.186
Right.
She wore the red shoes.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.685
We should start with
the more recent remains.

03:11.776 --> 03:13.391
Which are sealed up.

03:13.486 --> 03:16.774
What is it with this job
and corpses encased
in mystery wrap?

03:16.864 --> 03:20.448
Dr. Hodgins says
it’s most likely polystyrene
ceiling insulation...

03:20.534 --> 03:22.149
that melted in the fire
and coated the body.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.075
Could he explain the sparkle?

03:24.163 --> 03:27.075
Fluorescent bulbs
exploded afterward,
shattering over the polystyrene.

03:27.166 --> 03:30.704
Perhaps you and Dr. Hodgins
can find a way
to unsea/ the remains.

03:30.795 --> 03:34.287
Well, let me see
ifl can get in here.

03:36.175 --> 03:39.133
Wire ligatures
around the wrist
indicate foul play.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.381
No evidence
of smoke inhalation.

03:41.472 --> 03:43.713
She was dead
before the fire.

03:43.808 --> 03:47.346
Now, that one is just weird.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.143
These bones were found
in a steel wardrobe.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.347
It preserved her
in the fire.

03:52.441 --> 03:56.229
Uh, female, also Caucasian,
40 to 50 years old.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.438
There’s evidence of
spinal kyphosis which would’ve
given her a hunched posture.

04:00.533 --> 04:04.446
This stain here on the forehead
is the result of contact with copper.

04:04.537 --> 04:09.031
I’ve seen this before
in disinterred bodies because of
the copper hardware on coffins.

04:09.125 --> 04:14.119
So someone robbed a grave,
strung together a skeleton
and stuck it in a wedding dress?

04:14.213 --> 04:16.044
That’s a reasonable conclusion.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.713
These are
greenstick fractures.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.792
Extreme force
was applied to the chest.

04:20.886 --> 04:24.344
And there’s
a clean-edged indentation...

04:24.432 --> 04:27.094
of the spinous processes,
L2 and L3.

04:27.184 --> 04:31.177
Thoracic crushing combined
with the puncture wound.

04:31.272 --> 04:36.107
This woman was subjected
to a kind of torture that
was used in the 17th century.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.774
Torture?

04:37.862 --> 04:40.774
These injuries are consistent
with a form of punishment...

04:40.865 --> 04:42.856

the Salem witch trials.

of the tension between us.

Tension?
There’s no tension
between us.

05:29.705 --> 05:33.994
Yeah, at first I thought
it was because I’m suddenly,
I don’t know, available again.

05:34.084 --> 05:38.828
And then I thought maybe
it was because you think
that I treated Wendell badly.

05:38.964 --> 05:43.082
Hold on. Wendell said
that it was totally mutual.
He said that you were wonderful.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.964

08:06.236 --> 08:09.273
Thank you.
At last I feel validated.

08:09.365 --> 08:12.778
Most cultures believe that some
sort of supernatural power...

08:12.868 --> 08:14.779
can be elicited through ritual.

Well, at least I don’t
ride there on my broomstick.

08:18.374 --> 08:20.706
Most witches align themselves
with the Wiccans.

08:20.793 --> 08:23.660

heterogeneous subject...

08:23.754 --> 08:28.293

like evil spells, sacrifices—

I told her I wouldn’t.
Thought it was stupid.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.093
So the fact that she didn’t
sell the house, that didn’t
get you upset or angry?

10:04.188 --> 10:08.101
No. No, l-l didn’t care
about the money.

to move to the city.

might go back to normal
if she saw more people.

- Guy named Mario Trivisini— Trivisonno.

was the key.

he had to give up
on the whole project.

an outstanding bench warrant
on you, young lady.

- For what?

on a speeding charge.

Oh. Yeah, well, that—
I didn’t speed.

12:33.378 --> 12:36.461

a bench warrant,
which is worse than speeding.

you have a warrant
for escaping police custody...

I will appear,

12:53.690 --> 12:56.523

will surrender as soon

he loses his hair
and he wants her dead.

No, you couldn’t have got me
anywhere near that lady— not
to kill her, not for anything.

on the bricks on the chimney.

35:40.973 --> 35:43.840
- Though the powder was des—
- Angela isn’t here
for a computer re-creation,

35:43.934 --> 35:45.515
so we have to make do.

35:45.602 --> 35:48.309
Please hold one and four
in the proper position.

35:48.397 --> 35:50.729
Sweets, it’s bilateral.
Do the same.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.683
Booth believes a witch
named Ember to be the killer,

35:53.777 --> 35:56.610
but the victim was a large,
heavily muscled woman.

35:56.697 --> 35:59.063
- But Ember
wasn’t strong enough.
- I observed her in the woods.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.991
She and the other Wiccans
were standing in a circle,

36:02.077 --> 36:04.113
taking turns
with their ceremonial object.

36:04.204 --> 36:08.038
These stab marks...

36:08.125 --> 36:10.457
reflect a similar pattern.

36:12.087 --> 36:16.831
Now, these injuries
are clustered.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.302
Five groupings of three.

36:19.386 --> 36:23.470
- So a total of 15 strikes.
- In the same pattern
as the dots on the chimney.

36:23.557 --> 36:26.640
it’s a pentagram.
it’s an ancient Wiccan symbol
that stands for solidarity.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.592
Some say sisterhood.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.929
There are 15 women
in the Circle of Moonwick.

36:32.024 --> 36:35.642
Ember alone wasn’t the killer.
The entire coven took part.

36:35.736 --> 36:38.899
No, they’re Wiccans though.
They’re white witches.
They stand for goodness.

36:38.989 --> 36:42.356
What if they were
stoned out of their minds?

36:42.451 --> 36:46.114
The powder on the path
is called secale cereale—
rye flour.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.572
And it’s infested with
the fungus C/a viceps purpurea.

36:49.666 --> 36:52.453
Formed in the ergot stage
of fungal development.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.377
It’s hallucinogenic—
the natural substance
from which LSD is derived.

36:55.464 --> 37:00.584
Yes, it was used
for ceremonial purposes
centuries ago in Salem.

37:00.677 --> 37:03.544
Some people think that
the exact same substance...

37:03.639 --> 37:07.223
was responsible for the hysteria
surrounding the witch trials
in the first place.

37:07.309 --> 37:09.174
Those naked ladies
were trippin’.

37:09.311 --> 37:12.974
Add that to the rituals,
and they may have thought the demon
they were slaying was real.

37:18.695 --> 37:23.314
Wiccans do not ingest any kind
of consciousness-altering drugs.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.320
Not on purpose.

37:25.411 --> 37:27.367
We believe you were
performing a ritual...

37:27.454 --> 37:29.490
meant to keep Zephyra’s evil
from spreading past the circle.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.196
A ritual
using rye flour.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.668
We use rye flour
in many ceremonies.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.538
Yeah, and it has
LSD fungus in it.

37:35.629 --> 37:37.540
That’s what made you
afraid of Zephyra.

37:37.631 --> 37:41.499
You thought that her
obsession with the black arts
could destroy you.

37:41.593 --> 37:45.461
You also knew that she
had Ember’s ancestor’s bones
on her side.

37:46.807 --> 37:48.923
I mean, you’re good witches.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.554
You’re nice people.
You don’t lie.

37:51.645 --> 37:54.182
But when you make a mistake,
you wanna make
that mistake right. Right?

37:57.818 --> 38:01.982
We were just trying to help.
We wanted Zephyra
to live in harmony.

38:02.072 --> 38:04.734
She kept cursing at us
and casting spells.

38:04.825 --> 38:08.363
We just wanted
to restore the balance.

38:09.538 --> 38:11.028
[ Exhales ]

38:12.916 --> 38:18.331
Dearly beloved,
we’re gathered here today to
join in holy wedded matrimony...

38:18.422 --> 38:23.086
Ange/a Pear/y Gates Montenegro
and Jack Stanley Hodgins / l/

38:23.177 --> 38:26.920
Um, there’s, um—
There’s one small problem.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.754
Please don’t change your mind.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.431
Oh, no.
That’s not it.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.224
lt’s, um—

38:35.814 --> 38:38.396
That’s not my real name.

38:38.484 --> 38:39.974
How bad could it be?

38:40.068 --> 38:42.901
Yeah. Did you get mine?
It’s Stanley.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.603
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

38:44.698 --> 38:48.361
Well, my dad is, um—
He’s sort of unique.

38:48.452 --> 38:52.946
And, well, he’s Texan
and, uh, other things.

38:53.040 --> 38:56.749
- So, do you mind if I just—
if I whisper it to you?
- That’ll work.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.793
Thank you.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.672
We’re here to wed
these two people.

39:07.763 --> 39:09.879
Vows?

39:11.558 --> 39:14.095
Vows.
[Clears Throat]

39:15.437 --> 39:18.770
Angela,
or whatever your name is,

39:20.526 --> 39:22.938
I’m your guy.

39:25.739 --> 39:28.025
Stanley,
[ Chuckles ]

39:28.116 --> 39:29.981
we’re gonna
live together...

39:30.077 --> 39:32.033
and we’re gonna
love together.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.327
And we’re gonna have
so much fun.

39:34.414 --> 39:36.951
And a little pain.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.408
And we’re gonna live a life...

39:39.503 --> 39:44.463
that’s just gonna make other people
die with jealousy wishing they were us.

39:47.302 --> 39:50.465
- You have rings?
- Yes. Yes.

39:54.393 --> 39:55.974
Where did you get that?

39:56.061 --> 39:59.394
- I’ve kept this in my wallet
since our first wedding.
- What?

39:59.481 --> 40:02.644
No. We didn’t
go through with it.

40:02.776 --> 40:05.893
Where did you get that?
I’ll tell you later.

40:05.988 --> 40:09.105
Oh— Oh.
Yeah.

40:09.199 --> 40:12.316
You may exchange the rings.

40:21.795 --> 40:26.038
By the power vested in me
in the state of Maryland, lnow
pronounce you husband and wife.

40:26.133 --> 40:27.623
You may—

40:31.054 --> 40:33.010
[Chuckling]

40:54.036 --> 40:58.245
- They were good people.
- Good people who butchered
another human being.

40:58.332 --> 41:01.199
They were being attacked.
They weren’t in
their right minds.

41:01.335 --> 41:05.328
Sometimes, you know, people,
they just get carried away.
Well, crazy people.

41:07.841 --> 41:09.627
What is that?

41:09.718 --> 41:13.336
This was given to me
by the witches.

41:13.430 --> 41:15.887
Look, it’s you—
Iittle Bones.

41:16.016 --> 41:18.598
No, it’s not.
[ Laughing ]
Yes, it is.

41:18.685 --> 41:23.429
You see, the witch said
that if! burn this
in your presence,

41:23.523 --> 41:26.435
then the wish I make for you
will come true.

41:26.526 --> 41:28.562
[Chuckles]

41:28.654 --> 41:31.737
You think I care,
but I don’t.

41:31.823 --> 41:35.361
It’s just superstition,
and for superstition to work,

41:35.452 --> 41:38.319
the person has to believe
that he or she is cursed
or under a spell.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.870
Watch you don’t
burn your fingers!

41:40.957 --> 41:42.868
Want to know
what I wished for?

41:42.959 --> 41:45.701
No. It doesn’t matter.
Completely irrelevant.

41:45.796 --> 41:50.085
I wish— I wished that you
could find happiness.

41:51.218 --> 41:53.129
I don’t know
what that means.

41:53.220 --> 41:56.462
Happiness— love, laughter,

41:56.556 --> 42:00.799
friendsh/p, purpose
and a dance.

42:00.894 --> 42:04.557
Oh. Well, then thank you.

42:04.648 --> 42:08.266
- Yeah. [Laughing]
- Why is that funny?

42:08.360 --> 42:12.023
’Cause you wouldn’t have
thanked me if you didn’t think
that part of it was true.

42:12.114 --> 42:16.027
No, l was thanking you
for your kindness, not because
I believe in the outcome.

42:16.118 --> 42:18.404
Ah, I detected relief.

42:18.495 --> 42:20.156
No— No, you didn’t.

42:20.247 --> 42:23.330
Relief that the mojo
was good and not bad.

42:23.417 --> 42:26.204
Okay, now you’re just
mixing up belief systems.

42:26.336 --> 42:29.248
Really? Okay. You want me
to burn another one?
No— How many do you have?

42:29.339 --> 42:30.670
I got a lot.

43:04.624 --> 43:06.000
What’s that mean?
