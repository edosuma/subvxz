00:03.737 --> 00:05.838
Sr. Senior Jr.:
Where is my papa?

00:05.840 --> 00:08.073
I have for you
a surprising surprise.

00:08.075 --> 00:10.109
I am in the
living lair, my son.

00:10.111 --> 00:13.145
The henchmen catalogue
arrived today.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.079
Ooh hoo hoo.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.248
The new mini-sub
is nice.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.250
Note the DVD player
in the backseat.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.752
Father, I...
now wait, wait.

00:19.754 --> 00:21.253
Before you speak, tell me,

00:21.255 --> 00:22.353
have you done your chores?

00:22.355 --> 00:24.790
Clean my room or scout
a target location

00:24.792 --> 00:26.025
for some evil deed?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.192
The second one.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.161
Well, I have not only located

00:29.163 --> 00:30.262
a target via satellite,

00:30.264 --> 00:32.698
but have assembled
a team of henchpersons

00:32.700 --> 00:33.866
with which to steal it.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.868
Well, who has taken my lazy son

00:35.870 --> 00:40.973
and replaced him with this energetic
and responsible evildoer?

00:40.975 --> 00:42.941
Tell me, what is
this exciting target?

00:42.943 --> 00:44.076
The tower of London.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.912
It is a big tower
filled with jewels.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.114
Yes. The crown jewels.

00:49.116 --> 00:50.014
Very good, son.

00:50.016 --> 00:53.018
Perhaps I may keep just one
jewel-encrusted doodah from the tower

00:53.020 --> 00:56.789
to fund my drive to become an
international teen pop sensation?

00:56.791 --> 00:59.758
Oh, take 2.
They're small.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.897
Mysterious black choppers,

01:04.899 --> 01:08.300

Thanks for the lift,

02:10.164 --> 02:13.265
Least I could do
after you saved my rig

02:13.267 --> 02:14.733
back there on highway 99.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.970
Yeah. 18 blowouts.
What are the chances?

02:17.972 --> 02:18.870
I don't get it, Kim.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.405
What kind of sick,
twisted supervillain

02:20.407 --> 02:23.242
steals the world's
largest cement swirly cone?

02:23.244 --> 02:25.177
A not so supervillain?

02:25.179 --> 02:28.147
Hey! Let's spin by the
school with this baby,

02:28.149 --> 02:29.982
and I'll be known
as the big swirly saver.

02:29.984 --> 02:32.251
Just might impress the ladies.

02:32.253 --> 02:32.951
Which ladies?

02:32.953 --> 02:36.088
Um, yeah. Giant
swirly-loving ladies?

02:36.090 --> 02:37.356
Yeah.
[Beep]

02:37.358 --> 02:40.425
Kim, Ron. I just
intercepted a communiqué

02:40.427 --> 02:42.194
from sr. Senior, Jr.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.129
I think he's planning to steal
the tower of London.

02:44.131 --> 02:48.667
Well, it's not exactly the world's
largest cement swirly, now is it?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.269
Something's not right, though.

02:50.271 --> 02:50.969
It's junior.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.405
See, his target
<i>is</i> the tower of London...

02:53.407 --> 02:54.105
Uh-huh.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.605
But he's on his way
to New Zealand.

02:55.607 --> 02:58.677
I'll admit that geography
is but one of many subjects

02:58.679 --> 03:02.314
in which I have scored
a gentleman "C," but isn't...

03:02.316 --> 03:04.116
The tower of London in england?

03:04.118 --> 03:07.686
Sr. Senior Jr.: There,
up ahead, our target.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.222
I can smell the diamonds
and rubies now.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.122
[Takes deep breath]

03:11.124 --> 03:14.126
And bangers and mash,
if I'm not mistaken.

03:14.128 --> 03:15.794
The encyclopedia
said the jewels

03:15.796 --> 03:17.696
are kept in that building
just below.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.696
Ha ha! The tower.

03:18.698 --> 03:23.001
Now the shiny jewels inside
are ours for the taking!

03:26.372 --> 03:29.741
Mysterious black choppers,
initiate operation.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.211
Steal the tower of London.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.913
That's it. A little lower.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.015
Oh, this is way too easy.

03:37.017 --> 03:37.815
White chopper?

03:37.817 --> 03:40.119
I thought we agreed that black
will be our chopper color today.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.955
Kim: You're a little
off target, junior.

03:42.957 --> 03:44.856
Like 12,000 Miles.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.292
What did she mean by that?

03:48.328 --> 03:50.462
Thanks for the lift,
Mr. huey.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.362
What do you mean?

03:51.364 --> 03:53.198
Your friend here said
you could pay cash.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.268
Ha ha. Yeah, uh, Wade
couldn't find a ride,

03:56.270 --> 03:58.170
so I looked in the phone book.

03:58.172 --> 03:59.238
Gotta go!

03:59.240 --> 04:02.808
I owe you a favor.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.416
Squirrel suit throw!

04:15.888 --> 04:17.222
Wha...?

04:19.192 --> 04:22.427
Knot-tying's
not my skill set.

04:24.330 --> 04:27.065
Fire!

04:28.234 --> 04:31.336
Thanks, Rufus!

04:33.306 --> 04:34.306
Hmm?

04:34.308 --> 04:36.275
Ohh... Uhh... I'm fine.

04:36.277 --> 04:39.478
Just fightin'
gym class flashbacks. Ahh!

04:44.284 --> 04:46.251
Sr. Senior Jr.: Ohh!
We're all going to crash!

04:46.253 --> 04:48.453
Black choppers,
land in that clearing.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.056
Carefully.

04:51.424 --> 04:56.528
Ugh. 6 helicopters equal
one tragic hair day.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.266
Ok, junior, finger taunt.

05:01.268 --> 05:05.103
And I taunt you back
with 3 fingers.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.272
Ok, he's tricky.

05:07.274 --> 05:07.972
Cut! Cut! Cut!

05:08.074 --> 05:11.476
Ok, first reaction...
you ruined my shot.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.578
But upon reflection, this:

05:13.580 --> 05:16.381
You kids are extreme with 5 xs.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.349
Jimmy Blamhammer,

05:17.351 --> 05:19.551
action movie maven,

05:19.553 --> 05:21.019
Hollywood, U.S.A.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.254
How do you do, Mr....

05:22.256 --> 05:23.288
Mr. Blamhammer, sir,

05:23.290 --> 05:24.388
it is an honor to meet you.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.558
I loved
<i>violent reaction I</i> and <i>III</i>

05:26.560 --> 05:29.995
and really loved <i>violent reaction ii.
Oh, yeah!</i>

05:29.997 --> 05:32.130
W-w-wait. Go back.
Movie maven?

05:32.132 --> 05:33.430
I'm afraid I do not understand.

05:33.432 --> 05:36.268
Your little helicopter stunt
almost blew over the set

05:36.270 --> 05:38.503
for my newest
action heist flick.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.372
<i>Stolen goods III.</i>

05:40.374 --> 05:43.075
Rated pg-13
for intense action

05:43.077 --> 05:44.376
and use of the word "butt."

05:44.378 --> 05:48.580
So this tower of London
is a movie set?

05:50.316 --> 05:53.385
I can't use pyro
on the real tower

05:53.387 --> 05:54.853
and stay under budget.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.021
So we came to New Zealand

05:56.023 --> 05:57.255
and built this replica.

05:57.257 --> 06:00.258
It looks identical
to the real thing...

06:00.260 --> 06:01.360
From space.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.394
Yeah, this is true.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.995
Ok, junior, your move.

06:03.997 --> 06:09.167
Aah! Every henchmen
for himself!

06:20.346 --> 06:21.613
Hmm.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.448
You hiring? I can do
hair and makeup.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.250
I always wanted
to be a stunt man.

06:25.252 --> 06:28.353
Eh, say stu in the big trailer.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.053
Wow!

06:29.055 --> 06:31.089
That maneuver you
pulled up there...

06:31.091 --> 06:33.225
no wires, no digital effects.

06:33.227 --> 06:37.028
That was pure, raw action!

06:37.030 --> 06:38.230
You are amazing!

06:38.232 --> 06:40.532
You're incredible!
You're...

06:40.534 --> 06:41.633
Kim Possible.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.333
I love that name!

New thought: My next international
action mega blockbuster...

06:47.341 --> 06:50.375
<i>Kim Possible I.</i>

06:50.377 --> 06:52.244

06:52.246 --> 06:53.245

06:53.247 --> 06:54.946
Come on, it's a no-brainer.

06:54.948 --> 06:55.646
Was that a shot?

06:55.748 --> 06:57.916
You hit the tween sweet spot.

06:57.918 --> 06:58.616

extraordinary circumstances.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.220
It's what's happening now.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.023
I don't know that I'd
call Kim ordinary.

07:05.025 --> 07:05.723
What about you?

07:05.725 --> 07:08.460
Me? Yeah. Oh, I'm more
ordinary than anyone.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.995
Extra ordinary, even.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.029
All right, you're in.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.330
It'll be about both of you.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.132
So we get to play ourselves?

07:14.134 --> 07:15.500
Ah! That's funny.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.269
No. Really,
you two will be played

by the hottest stars
in Hollywood.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.206
Hmm. Like, uh, who?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.608

07:27.214 --> 07:27.912
No way.

07:27.914 --> 07:29.512
But aren't they
a little old to play us?

07:29.514 --> 07:31.316
Haven't you heard
the expression

07:31.318 --> 07:32.551
"act your age?"

07:32.553 --> 07:33.251
But they're 28.

07:33.253 --> 07:37.122
What did I say? They'll
be acting your age,

07:37.124 --> 07:38.256
not their age.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.525
See? It's
Hollywood magic.

capture my Ron-ness.

He's mopey when he plays
a mopey character.

I'm sure he can capture
your Ron-ness.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.634
just like real people.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.670
[Gasps] This'll be so great!

09:31.672 --> 09:34.139
I've never done any,
like, school things.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.273
I learned everything I know

09:35.275 --> 09:38.476
from on-set teacher
thingy people.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.278
You mean tutors?

09:40.280 --> 09:40.978
Yes!

09:40.980 --> 09:44.282
Um, Quinn, did you go
to regular school?

09:44.284 --> 09:44.982
Whatever.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.282
[Whispers] Is that a yes or no?

09:46.284 --> 09:48.253
Hop in, everybody.
I'll drive you to school

09:48.255 --> 09:49.621
on my way out of town.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.521
Here's a release form,

09:50.523 --> 09:51.921
allowing your kid
to ride with me.

09:51.923 --> 09:53.658
Just sign it and fax it
to the car.

09:53.660 --> 09:56.361
I got extra helmets
in the back.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.364
[Tires screeching]

09:59.366 --> 10:00.432
Show folk.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.501
Junior, you are being punished.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.303
While watching the
robot clean the pool,

10:05.305 --> 10:08.640
you are not to enjoy any
show biz trade papers.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.475
Bu-bu-but, father,
I have just read

10:10.477 --> 10:12.243
the most disturbing news.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.312
They are making
a Kim Possible movie.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.647
Wonderful.
We can watch it

10:15.649 --> 10:17.482
in our private screening lair.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.550
You do not understand.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.819
I was there
when she was discovered.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.287
I should be in this movie.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.889
This film should be
my big break!

10:24.891 --> 10:29.260
I will be cast in that picture!

10:29.528 --> 10:31.364
Ok, if this is going to work,

10:31.365 --> 10:35.533
you guys have to blend in
as regular kids.

10:35.535 --> 10:38.269
My greatest
acting challenge ever.

10:38.271 --> 10:38.969
Whatever.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.672
Ok, see? That's what
I'm talking about.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.841
If Ron Stoppable
was trying to blend in,

10:42.843 --> 10:46.611
Ron Stoppable would
throw himself into it 110%.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.579
Whatever.

10:47.581 --> 10:49.848
Oh, come on, man!
Ron it up!

10:50.816 --> 10:53.385
Ron it down.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.153
<i>A tale of two cities.</i>

10:55.155 --> 10:56.488
Important book.
Pretty thick.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.924
Charlie dickens.
Accomplished literary fellow.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.326
Can anyone tell me
about Chuck's use

11:01.328 --> 11:03.728
of the third person
in the book?

11:03.730 --> 11:05.196
How about possible?

11:05.198 --> 11:06.931
Um, I had a mission
in New Zealand,

11:06.933 --> 11:10.335
so I, um, I didn't get
to read it, actually.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.737
Well, then, that's
points off your grade...

11:12.739 --> 11:13.437
Actually.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.737
Yes, new girl with her hand up.

11:14.739 --> 11:17.542
Yeah. I was in
a made-for-TV version

11:17.544 --> 11:18.542
of <i>a Christmas Carol,</i>

11:18.744 --> 11:20.378
which isn't the book that
you're talking about,

11:20.380 --> 11:23.214
but I think that dickens
guy was involved.

11:23.216 --> 11:27.352
He may have been, like,
a producer or something?

11:27.354 --> 11:28.453
And you are?

11:28.455 --> 11:29.220
It's Heather.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.555
<i>The</i> Heather?

11:30.557 --> 11:31.155
Both: Ahh!

11:31.257 --> 11:33.558
We're gonna have to move on
from blending in.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.359
To what?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.327
Running and hiding.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.297
[Screaming]

11:49.675 --> 11:51.976
[All gasp]

11:54.547 --> 11:55.613
They disappeared.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.413
Typical Possible.

11:56.415 --> 11:57.713
A movie star comes
to our school,

11:57.715 --> 12:02.619
and she has to hog
all the glamor for herself.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.255
Lost 'em.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.390
So not the drama.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.858
Um, right.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.226
I hear the girls were all wild

12:08.228 --> 12:10.595
about some movie
star or something.

12:10.597 --> 12:11.496
Whatever.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.764
Yeah, whatever.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.966
See? You're not just
an actor, mister,

12:14.968 --> 12:17.702
you're a role model,
a trend-setter.

12:17.704 --> 12:18.402
Whatever.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.838
Can you believe this guy?

12:19.840 --> 12:20.538
Whatever.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.208
I will not rest until
you find your inner Ron.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.243
Hey! Dare to care.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.412
Heather: Ok,
we made it out.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.312
Here's our next move.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.715
Excuse me,
but usually, I decide

12:30.717 --> 12:31.983
what the next move is.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.619
Right. It's kind of
a teen hero thing.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.421
Oh, you're being me.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.022
Ha ha. Great.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.758
I'm thinking mall.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.893
Wow, that's
what I was thinking.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.328
Are you sure she'll come?

12:43.330 --> 12:44.796
I just put out some new capris.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.298
Please. She's got
a closet full already.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.466
Kim has periwinkle and olive.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.035
This is our newest color...

12:51.037 --> 12:52.504
guava!

12:52.506 --> 12:53.705
I love them.
I love them.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.306
Who's the girl?

12:55.308 --> 12:57.475
[Scoffs] You are.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.175
Hi, Kim.

12:58.177 --> 13:00.745
You know, I feel like
we hardly get to hang out,

13:00.747 --> 13:02.447
just us girls.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.247
Fine.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.349
So then what happened, Monique?

13:04.351 --> 13:05.649
Well, this boy was in my face,

13:05.651 --> 13:09.287
and I told him, "quit macking
and start backing off!"

13:09.289 --> 13:11.689
Girl, I totally know
what you're saying.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.325
I have this man who would
not leave me alone.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.394
He was practically stalking me.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.629
Get out!

13:17.631 --> 13:18.229
I won't!

13:18.231 --> 13:19.798
If he hadn't been my husband,

13:19.800 --> 13:21.366
it would've been creepy.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.635
Your teeth are, like,
the totally whitest teeth

13:23.637 --> 13:24.869
I've, like, ever seen.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.839
It is so cool of you to notice.

13:27.841 --> 13:28.939
I had this goo put on them

13:28.941 --> 13:31.309
and a purple light
shined on them or whatever.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.077
No way. I so want
to try that,

13:33.079 --> 13:35.413
but my mother says
it's way too expensive.

13:35.415 --> 13:40.385
No way! That's what
my agent said. Ha!

13:40.387 --> 13:40.985
She's good.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.787
Yeah. Little miss perfect.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.355
Ron: This is it.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.624
If this doesn't get you
on the path to ronhood,

13:46.626 --> 13:47.324
nothing will.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.661
The entire Bueno Nacho
menu board is here,

13:49.663 --> 13:51.930
and it's all Grande-sized.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.765
[Mumbling excitedly]

13:53.767 --> 13:54.966
Huh? Hey.

13:54.968 --> 13:55.666
Sorry, Rufus.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.336
The snackage is not for eating.
It's for teaching.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.370
Quinn, dig in.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.073
Whatever.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.376
And?

14:05.378 --> 14:06.076
Whatever.

14:06.078 --> 14:09.914
Ohh! What kind of
unfeeling robot are you?!

14:09.916 --> 14:11.416
Ma ma ma ma ma.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.483
[Whimpers]

14:12.485 --> 14:13.985
Go ahead. Whatever.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.855
[Gasps] No!

14:17.423 --> 14:21.025
[Horn plays <i>la cucaracha]</i>

14:22.139 --> 14:23.362
Hey, Mr. Blamhammer.

14:23.363 --> 14:27.398
Keep it close.
I'm a fast eater.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.902
[Tires screeching]

14:33.038 --> 14:34.672
Aah!

14:36.108 --> 14:38.643
Huh?

14:42.081 --> 14:43.848
"Sr. Senior. Jr."

14:43.850 --> 14:47.085
Wait. It says here
you know how to fence.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.086
This I did not know.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.588
A... a teensy white lie,
father.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.756
Still, it is a lie,

14:51.758 --> 14:54.759
and that's a start
on the road to evil.

14:54.761 --> 14:55.994
Ohh!

14:55.996 --> 14:56.794
A trendy eatery!

14:56.796 --> 15:00.531
No doubt brimming over
with dreamers and schemers

15:00.533 --> 15:02.901
and the power elite!

15:03.135 --> 15:04.402
[Screaming]

15:04.404 --> 15:05.570
Nothing speaks to me.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.438
What's the special?

15:07.440 --> 15:10.541
Well, well, what have we here?

15:10.543 --> 15:12.944
"Special skills."

15:12.946 --> 15:15.613
Fencing?! Liar!

15:15.615 --> 15:17.015
No! No! No!

15:17.017 --> 15:19.083
Careful, junior.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.587
Whoa!

15:22.589 --> 15:24.555
Dear, have you seen
the guest towels?

15:24.557 --> 15:26.824
Did you ask our guest?

15:26.826 --> 15:29.127
Yes. Heather is
as baffled as I am.

15:29.129 --> 15:32.597
Show folk. Ha!
Can't trust 'em.

15:33.198 --> 15:35.199
Now where's
my diet soda? Hmm.

15:35.201 --> 15:38.603
Told you our Heather memorabilia
would sell out fast.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.303
We need more.

15:39.305 --> 15:42.440
Print me out another
certificate of authenticity.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.440
This time for half a can

15:43.442 --> 15:45.176
of Heather's
favorite diet soda.

15:45.178 --> 15:45.876
Cha-ching!

15:45.878 --> 15:48.713
Monique, I'm fighting off
a freak-out.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.149
This Heather is Kim thing
is bordering on weird.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.984
Girl, it crossed
the border days ago.

15:52.986 --> 15:57.155
She told me she's been using
your toothbrush at home.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.055
Ew. Thanks for that.

15:58.057 --> 16:01.292
Well, listen, the girl didn't
go to a regular school,

16:01.294 --> 16:03.227
so you know she didn't cheer.

16:03.229 --> 16:04.327
That's something you can do

16:04.329 --> 16:06.164
that movie Kim
definitely cannot.

16:06.166 --> 16:10.201
Yeah. For once, she'll have
to sit back and just watch.

16:10.203 --> 16:10.901
What?

16:10.903 --> 16:12.401
So, Heather, on behalf
of the squad,

16:12.403 --> 16:16.040
I was wondering if you wanted
to lead practice today.

16:16.042 --> 16:16.975
Please and thank you.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.142
But she's never cheered.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.142
Don't you read the tabs?

16:19.144 --> 16:22.146
She trains with, like, the
hottest yoga instructor in L.A.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.115
She can handle it.
It's no...

16:24.117 --> 16:26.818
big. I know.

16:27.404 --> 16:27.853
Ahh!

16:27.854 --> 16:30.955
Who's there?
What do you want?

16:30.957 --> 16:31.655
Mr. Jimmy,

16:31.657 --> 16:34.192
so sorry to commandeer
your satellite dish,

16:34.194 --> 16:35.192
but I must speak at you.

16:35.194 --> 16:38.062
Your approach seems
strange and criminal,

16:38.064 --> 16:39.362
but you've got my attention.

16:39.364 --> 16:42.100
I insist that you cast me as the
villain in your new picture.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.602
To that end, I will perform
my audition monologue,

16:44.604 --> 16:47.672
the emotional soliloquy
from the martial arts classic

16:47.674 --> 16:49.173
<i>fist of pain.</i>

16:49.175 --> 16:52.677
Hyah! Hyah!

16:52.679 --> 16:53.745
Whoo ha ha!

16:53.747 --> 16:54.345
Yoo hoo hoo!

16:54.347 --> 16:57.816
You just lost my attention.

17:00.552 --> 17:01.986
Audition over.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.321
Ohh, father!

17:03.323 --> 17:06.257
This business is so cruel!

17:06.259 --> 17:06.957
[Sobbing]

17:06.959 --> 17:10.528
Then we must be crueler still.

17:12.097 --> 17:14.198
I am not loving this,
not one bit.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.233
[Telephone rings]

17:15.235 --> 17:16.868
Go!
[Ring]

17:16.870 --> 17:18.536
Wrong phone.
[Ring]

17:18.538 --> 17:19.136
Go. Ohh!

17:19.238 --> 17:22.941
The micromini cell
implanted in my brain.

17:23.043 --> 17:23.741
Go.
[Beep]

17:23.743 --> 17:25.877
Jimmy, I am so ready
for the shoot.

17:25.979 --> 17:28.146
Beautiful.
And Quinn?

17:28.148 --> 17:28.846
Whatever.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.848
Wow. He is
a chameleon.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.948
The research really helped.

17:31.950 --> 17:34.886
I want you two on the
next plane out of there.

17:34.888 --> 17:35.586
Whatever.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.686
Tell Quinn to cut that out.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.090
His transformation is
freaking with my head.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.024
See you on the set.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.927
Jimmy: Places, everyone.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.332
Action.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.868
Can we hold the roll for a sec?

17:50.870 --> 17:53.805
I feel like a carrot stick.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.642
Mmm. Thanks, guys.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.610
Take me back.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.115
And action.

18:04.283 --> 18:05.817
Hello, Ron.
Are you ready

18:05.819 --> 18:08.252
for the big pep rally
this afternoon?

18:08.254 --> 18:08.852
Whatever.

18:08.854 --> 18:11.622
Sr. Senior Jr.: Cut, cut,
cut, cut, cut, cut.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.858
Did I say, "cut"?
Who cut?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.260
I am the one who said cut.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.863
Ahh!

18:19.198 --> 18:22.233
What the... the grips
are yelling "cut" now.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.135
I am no grip.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.937
I am sr. Senior, Jr.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.206
And I demand you cast me
as the villain

18:28.208 --> 18:29.807
in this picture.

18:29.809 --> 18:30.807
Look, we got a villain.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.376
Now we're shooting
back-to-back sequels.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.676
Just have your agent contact...

18:33.678 --> 18:36.948
no! No! You will do
this, Jimmy Blamhammer,

18:36.950 --> 18:37.648
or else!

18:37.650 --> 18:41.152
I thought it would be so fun
to have Heather be me.

18:41.154 --> 18:41.852
Wrong.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.055
Well, it had to be better
than having Quinn be...

18:44.157 --> 18:44.955
Not at all me!

18:44.957 --> 18:47.725
The whole thing
of a Kim Possible movie.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.360
Holly-weird,
if you ask me.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.628
Well, we've done our part.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.296
Yeah, right. We're
free and clear.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.664
[Beep] Go, Wade.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.634
Who's up for a trip
to Hollywood?

18:57.236 --> 18:58.269
I own this town.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.171
You can't threaten me, punk!

19:00.173 --> 19:01.372
I am not. I intend
to threaten this...

19:01.374 --> 19:04.208
your personal
digital assistant.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.310
But all my phone numbers
are in there.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.778
All my lunch dates.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.181
All my dinner dates.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.816
No!

19:11.818 --> 19:14.719
Uhh! Movie Kim, movie Ron.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.687
Stop this madman!

19:16.689 --> 19:18.289
Wait, is that in our deal?

19:18.291 --> 19:19.190
Whatever.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.324
Ok. But let's make sure

19:20.326 --> 19:23.327
we are rolling on this, people.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.999
Henchpersons?
A little help.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.867
Hyah! Ohh!

19:29.869 --> 19:32.270
Ohh!
I'm totally stuck.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.804
Guys?

19:34.139 --> 19:36.307
Quinn, do something!

19:36.309 --> 19:39.310
Whatever.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.411
Bring it.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.813
Aah!

19:43.815 --> 19:45.149
C.G.I. Rufus, attack!

19:45.151 --> 19:47.118
C.G.I. Rufus: Put 'em up,
mister man. Put 'em up!

19:47.120 --> 19:49.153
What is this now I'm hearing?

19:49.155 --> 19:50.788
Hyah!

19:50.790 --> 19:53.057
Hyah! Rufus power!

19:53.059 --> 19:55.126
Ha ha! Very entertaining.

19:55.128 --> 19:55.826
Hyah!

19:55.828 --> 19:57.428
But isn't the mole rat
usually naked?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.697
Hey, hey. It's
a family action picture.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.699
Enough!
I want the contract

20:01.701 --> 20:02.967
and I want it now!

20:02.969 --> 20:05.102
All right.
Hold your henchmen.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.071
I'll get legal on the phone.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.139
[Crash]

20:08.141 --> 20:11.142
Whoa.
Uncanny recreation.

20:11.144 --> 20:13.177
Hey, my missing
algebra homework.

20:13.179 --> 20:13.977
What have we here?

20:13.979 --> 20:16.214
Stunt doubles
for Heather and Quinn

20:16.216 --> 20:18.349
will now try to foil
my career plans?

20:18.351 --> 20:20.785
No, I think they're
the real deal.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.320
Oh, yes. You are right.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.256
Stop them! Ow!

20:27.059 --> 20:28.426
[Gasps]

20:29.928 --> 20:33.931
Ha! Authentic right down
to the gum in the fountain.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.040
Both: Uhh! Thanks.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.243
Whoa! Uhh!

20:46.912 --> 20:49.447
Comical sidekick takes
out big scary dude.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.283
Take one. Boo-ya.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.085
Whoa.

20:59.057 --> 21:01.192
[Groaning]

21:02.394 --> 21:03.961
People, that's a wrap.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.464
Oh ho ho! Don't go
Hollywood on me, K.P.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.164
Not so fast,

21:07.166 --> 21:11.235
this good guy's win ending
just doesn't work for me.

21:12.137 --> 21:13.337
Boo-ya!

21:13.339 --> 21:15.906
He's a natural.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.074
It's just too difficult

21:17.076 --> 21:19.977
to break into this
business we call show.

21:19.979 --> 21:24.348
Farewell, Hollywood.

21:25.050 --> 21:25.784
Thanks, Kim.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.152
I know it took a lot for you
to come save the day

21:28.154 --> 21:30.121
after I got all over
your last nerve.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.290
No big. Look,
for what it's worth,

21:32.292 --> 21:34.392
I think you'll be a great Kim.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.260
Oh, I know I will be.

21:36.262 --> 21:39.897
But it means so much to me
that you said that.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.165
Yeah, but my man Quinn here

21:41.167 --> 21:43.200
has really got
the methody Ron-ness down.

21:43.202 --> 21:46.137
And the award
goes to him as me!

21:46.139 --> 21:46.837
Boo-ya.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.105
Ok, don't wear it out, babe.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.405
Jimmy: Listen up, people.

21:49.407 --> 21:51.042
We're shutting down production.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.143
What?
What?

21:52.145 --> 21:54.211
What?
Boo-ya?

21:54.213 --> 21:56.047
I'm on to the next big thing.

21:56.049 --> 21:56.947
What's that?

21:56.949 --> 22:00.117
<i>Monkey ninjas in space.</i>

22:00.119 --> 22:01.419
Been there.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.020
Done that.

22:03.022 --> 22:03.720
My son...

22:03.722 --> 22:06.257
no, my sun, father.
You're blocking it.

22:06.259 --> 22:07.892
I understand you were
most disappointed

22:07.894 --> 22:10.061
that your Hollywood dreams
have been dashed.

22:10.063 --> 22:14.131
True. But I have bought a piece
of Hollywood for myself.

22:14.133 --> 22:14.965
What is that?

22:14.967 --> 22:15.965
Half a can of diet cola

22:15.967 --> 22:20.037
and the guest towel
personally used by Heather!
