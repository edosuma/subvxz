Yeah, go pups!

01:08.002 --> 01:11.336

¶

01:35.296 --> 01:36.562
Hey, pups.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.030
Hi, Ryder.
We're having a contest

01:38.032 --> 01:41.967
to see who's the fastest pup.
But it keeps ending up a tie.

01:41.969 --> 01:42.601
(Laughing)

01:42.603 --> 01:47.473
So, Ryder, where's the big
surprise for our big trip?

01:47.475 --> 01:49.441
Check this out.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.609
(Beeping)

01:50.611 --> 01:52.811
I wonder what it is.
What could it be?

01:52.813 --> 01:54.680
I don't know.
Is it food?

01:54.682 --> 01:57.015

Say hello to the PAW Patroller.

02:10.197 --> 02:13.799
(Pups cheering and howling)

02:13.801 --> 02:16.034
Totally awesome truck!

02:16.036 --> 02:18.737
This is how we're going
on our road trips?

02:18.739 --> 02:22.040
Yep. The Patroller
is a lookout on wheels.

02:22.042 --> 02:24.076
It can take us anywhere.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.110
Sweet!

02:25.112 --> 02:27.112
Can we see inside?

02:27.114 --> 02:28.013
Sure. Come on!

02:28.015 --> 02:32.050
(Pups howling and barking)

02:32.052 --> 02:33.719

02:38.826 --> 02:40.659
Check it out.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.227
Nice ride!

02:42.229 --> 02:44.663
Our pup houses go in there?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.098
Sure do. Come on.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.500
It gets even cooler.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.739
This is the hangout area.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.608
That's where you can lounge
and play games.

02:58.112 --> 03:01.079

03:02.216 --> 03:04.249
What doesn't this truck have?

03:04.251 --> 03:06.652
Look, there's even
a spot for my ATV.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.453
PUPS:
Whoa! Yes!

03:08.455 --> 03:10.522
(Beeping)
And now for the best part.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.425
The cab is like the control room
at the lookout.

03:13.427 --> 03:16.128
This is where I can assign
you pups your jobs.

03:16.130 --> 03:16.995
Soft!

03:16.997 --> 03:18.163
Comfy.
Excellent.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.337
PUP:
Awesome!

03:25.339 --> 03:28.207
RoboDog's programmed
to drive the Patroller.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.942
Check this out:

03:29.944 --> 03:31.810
RoboDog, honk!

03:31.812 --> 03:33.111

03:33.113 --> 03:35.581
(Howling)

03:37.051 --> 03:37.883

03:37.885 --> 03:38.717
(Phone ringing)

03:38.719 --> 03:42.854

Watch this.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.725

03:54.668 --> 03:57.135
(Beeping)
Hey, Jake.
How's the big trip going?

03:57.137 --> 03:58.770
<i> It's going amazing!</i>

03:58.772 --> 04:00.606
<i> Check it out!</i>

04:00.608 --> 04:02.674
PUPS:
Aw!
Oh, penguins!

04:02.676 --> 04:07.179
<i> Oh, you'll see tons more when</i>
<i> you and the pups get out here</i>

04:07.181 --> 04:08.347
<i> to the ice field.</i>

04:08.349 --> 04:11.149
Awesome. The map's up
on the screen right now.

04:11.151 --> 04:14.353
We input your phone signal
into the navigator.

04:14.355 --> 04:17.122
That will make it easy
to find you.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.090
Totally.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.791
Hey, and bring lots of eats.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.860
You get serious hungry out here.

04:21.862 --> 04:26.765
Speaking of, time for
a tasty granola bar snack.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.800
I-- ooh--
Whoops!

04:28.802 --> 04:31.270
RYDER:
<i> Careful, Jake.</i>

04:31.272 --> 04:34.139
Oh, no! Hah!

04:34.141 --> 04:35.774
Oh!

04:35.776 --> 04:37.042
<i> Uh-oh!</i>

04:37.044 --> 04:38.810
Poor Jake!

04:38.812 --> 04:40.946
<i> I got it, got it!</i>

04:42.449 --> 04:44.082
RYDER:
<i> Jake!</i>

04:44.084 --> 04:46.785
<i> Oh, no--</i>

04:46.787 --> 04:48.553
I don't got it.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.322
Jake's in big trouble!

04:50.324 --> 04:52.057
Don't worry, we're on our way.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.525
But the phone
fell in the water.

04:53.527 --> 04:56.461
And that's the signal
we're using to track him.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.163
We saved his location
on the map.

04:58.165 --> 05:01.633
The computer will give us
the directions to get there.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.404
Pups, get your vehicles.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.539
It's time for a road trip.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.542
(Cheering)

05:12.579 --> 05:14.946
RoboDog, let's roll!

05:14.948 --> 05:16.515
(Revving engine)

05:16.517 --> 05:27.559
¶

05:46.814 --> 05:50.549
Oh, my phone and
everything gone!

05:50.551 --> 05:53.819
Deep under ice-cold water.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.688
(Ice cracking)

05:56.690 --> 05:57.723
Whoa!

05:57.725 --> 05:59.358
No!

05:59.360 --> 06:01.660
(Panting)
Huh?

06:03.931 --> 06:04.730
Ugh!

06:04.732 --> 06:06.298
Woohoo, I did it!

06:06.300 --> 06:08.100
I rescued someone!

06:09.570 --> 06:11.837
Sweet save, pup!
Thanks!

06:11.839 --> 06:13.805
I always wanted to do
a real rescue.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.908
Sometimes I practise
rescuing penguins.

06:16.910 --> 06:21.646
But they never say thank you.
Or anything, except "Honk!"

06:21.648 --> 06:23.548
But that was great, uh...

06:23.550 --> 06:25.117
I'm Jake.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.519
Hiya, Jake.
I'm Everest.

06:27.521 --> 06:28.286
(Laughing)

06:28.288 --> 06:31.923
So Everest, do you know where I
could find a phone around here?

06:31.925 --> 06:34.726
No, but we should
probably get going.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.427
Why?

06:35.429 --> 06:36.261
A storm's rolling in.

06:36.263 --> 06:40.365
I wouldn't want to lose my first
real rescue in a blizzard.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.767
Let's wait it out in my igloo.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.302
It's just a mile or two
across the ice.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.804
Do you have any hot cocoa
in that igloo?

06:45.806 --> 06:49.674
No, but I have some awesome
liver-flavoured tea.

06:49.676 --> 06:53.278
(Laughing)
Water will be fine.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.717
¶

06:58.719 --> 07:01.253
Hope we can make it
before the storm hits.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.587
(Wind howling)

07:02.589 --> 07:03.121
Yikes.

07:03.123 --> 07:07.392
It's nose-freezing cold
out there.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.294
(Panting)

07:10.464 --> 07:13.064
Snowy, too!

07:13.066 --> 07:15.300
(Laughing)

07:16.937 --> 07:18.336
(Tires squealing)

07:18.338 --> 07:21.907
Careful, RoboDog.
It's a little icy.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.375
Slow down a bit.

07:23.377 --> 07:25.143
(Barking)

07:26.246 --> 07:29.147
(Tires squealing)

07:29.149 --> 07:32.184
Great driving.
(Barking)

07:32.186 --> 07:34.419
You doing okay
back there, Jake?

07:34.421 --> 07:35.420
Don't worry about me.

07:35.422 --> 07:38.023
My pals from the PAW Patrol
are on the way.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.424
I can't wait to meet them.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.326
It gets kind of lonely
sometimes.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.728
Hey, are you gonna stay
around here?

07:43.730 --> 07:47.599
It would be great
to have a friend nearby.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.500
I'm just visiting.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.635
I've got a mountain
back at Adventure Bay

07:50.637 --> 07:52.337
I've go have to look after.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.306
(Sniffing)

07:54.308 --> 07:55.407
Wind's picking up.

07:55.409 --> 07:58.109
We've got to get some shelter
till your friends get here.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.011
Too bad you're not a pup.

08:00.013 --> 08:00.879
Why is that?

08:00.881 --> 08:02.914
So you can do this.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.150
Whee!

08:05.152 --> 08:08.487
Oh, you mean bellybogganing!

08:08.489 --> 08:10.589
Look out below!

08:10.591 --> 08:12.991
Move over, pup.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.659
I'm a bellyboggan pro!

08:14.661 --> 08:16.561
(Penguins chirrupping)

08:16.563 --> 08:19.197
Show-offs!

08:20.601 --> 08:23.668
You've met
your match, fur face.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.870
Think so, huh?

08:24.872 --> 08:27.105
Well, I know a shortcut.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.807
(Howling)

08:28.809 --> 08:31.142
Whoa!

08:31.144 --> 08:32.511
(Whistling through air)

08:32.513 --> 08:34.980
(Penguins chirrupping)

08:39.286 --> 08:40.952
Are you okay?

08:40.954 --> 08:42.787
I'm better than okay.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.756
I'm a winner!

08:44.758 --> 08:47.058
(Laughing)

08:47.060 --> 08:49.928
We're fresh out of hill.
Time to walk.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.063
Lead the way.

08:53.867 --> 08:58.169
Sorry, igloo's still
pretty far away.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.672
That's okay.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.339
Poor Jake.

09:01.341 --> 09:04.042
You need to grow your own
fur coat like me.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.444
But till then...

09:06.446 --> 09:09.948
Everest?
What are you doing?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.750
Digging, silly.

09:16.490 --> 09:19.190
We wouldn't have made it
to my igloo.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.393
This should do it for now.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.527
Excellent digging.

09:22.529 --> 09:23.795
It's nice and dry in here.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.631
And your coat's
so awesomely warm.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.533
The fleas think so, too.

09:28.535 --> 09:29.701
Fleas?

09:29.703 --> 09:31.303
Gotcha!

09:31.305 --> 09:32.470
(Laughing)

09:32.472 --> 09:34.339
(Growling)

09:34.341 --> 09:35.173
Uh-oh.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.909
Just what we need-- bears.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.543
Bears?

09:38.545 --> 09:41.112
We don't get a lot of bears
around here.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.113
(Growling)

09:42.115 --> 09:44.983
Uh, yeah, hear that?

09:44.985 --> 09:47.319
That's no bear,
that's just my tummy.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.654
It gets kind of growly
when I'm hungry.

09:49.656 --> 09:52.357
I've got just the thing.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.792
Granola bar.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.560
Is it liver-flavoured?

09:55.562 --> 09:58.830
No, just plain granola.

09:58.832 --> 10:03.435
Okay, thanks.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.071
Mm-mm! Yum-a-licious!

10:06.073 --> 10:08.073
I sure am glad I rescued you.

10:08.075 --> 10:11.076
Aw. Me too, Everest.

10:11.078 --> 10:11.810
Me too.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.746
¶ 83 boxes of treats

on the wall ¶

10:21.221 --> 10:23.088
We almost there, Ryder?

10:23.090 --> 10:26.391
We're about 30 boxes
of treats away.

10:26.393 --> 10:30.095
(Tires squealing)
PUPS:
Whoa!

10:30.097 --> 10:32.931
Maybe longer than
30 boxes of treats.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.100

10:39.239 --> 10:42.073
SKYE:
Yay!
More penguins!

10:42.075 --> 10:44.643
Penguins?
Are we near water?

10:44.645 --> 10:48.013
Hard to tell.
Everything's covered in snow.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.581
Hey, penguins!

10:49.583 --> 10:50.348
Nice suit!

10:50.350 --> 10:52.917
(Tires squealing)
PUPS:
Whoa!

10:52.919 --> 10:54.853
This everybody's seatbelt on?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.121
Yeah.
I'm buckled in.

10:56.123 --> 10:56.855
I'm good, too.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.456
I'm buckled in.
I'm good.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.692
Great.
Now, easy, RoboDog.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.194
Just try to steer out of it.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.865
(Tires squealing)

11:06.867 --> 11:07.766
Careful.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.535
(Rumbling)
Whoa!

11:10.537 --> 11:14.005
Whee-ee-ee-ee!

11:14.007 --> 11:15.040
(Rumbling stopping)

11:15.042 --> 11:18.343
Well, the road just got
less bumpy. Right, Ryder?

11:18.345 --> 11:21.579
I'm not sure this is a road.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.581
(Ice cracking)

11:23.583 --> 11:25.283
(Tires squealing)

11:25.285 --> 11:28.586
Uh-oh. I think we're driving
on a frozen lake.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.822
And it looks like
the ice is cracking.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.758
(Ice cracking,
everyone exclaiming)

11:33.760 --> 11:36.094
(Ice cracking)

11:36.096 --> 11:37.429
RoboDog, step on it!

11:37.431 --> 11:39.764
We need to get back
to the highway!

11:39.766 --> 11:42.033

That was close.

We're here, pups.
We made it.

12:13.366 --> 12:17.702
¶

12:17.704 --> 12:18.436
According to the map,

12:18.438 --> 12:20.939
Jake called us
from right around here.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.108
PUP:
It looks pretty empty.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.043
He's probably
taken shelter someplace

12:25.045 --> 12:26.578
to get out of the storm.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.080
Let's find him.
Jake!

12:29.082 --> 12:34.085
PUPS:
Jake! Jake! Jake!

12:34.087 --> 12:35.253
Achoo!

12:35.255 --> 12:37.689
JAKE:
Gesundheit!

12:40.427 --> 12:43.561
Oh, no fair.
I can't move my arms.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.931
I can fix that.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.400
Everest, you rock!

12:49.402 --> 12:52.670
I rock! I rock! I rock!

12:52.672 --> 12:55.440
Wait, so
what kind of rock am I?

12:55.442 --> 12:58.009
I'll explain it on the way
to the igloo.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.878
(Barking)

12:59.880 --> 13:02.147

No tracks.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.584

13:06.586 --> 13:08.720
Just more cute penguins.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.288
(Skye giggling)

13:10.290 --> 13:13.091
(Penguins chirrupping)

13:13.093 --> 13:15.627
What was that?

13:18.265 --> 13:20.598
A-ha!

13:20.600 --> 13:21.900
You're not Jake.

13:21.902 --> 13:22.901
(Squawking)

13:22.903 --> 13:25.236
Ouch! Sorry.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.438
Uh-oh.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.344
(Penguins chirrupping)

13:33.346 --> 13:35.613
I said sorry.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.448
(Sniffing)

13:37.450 --> 13:41.786
(Gasping)
Zuma, check this out!

13:41.788 --> 13:43.922
Jake's phone and knapsack.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.324
(Barking)
Buoy!

13:50.530 --> 13:53.131
I'll tell Ryder.
Ruff, ruff!

13:53.567 --> 13:57.368
Ryder, we found
Jake's phone and backpack.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.939
It fell into the water.
Now it's frozen solid.

14:00.941 --> 14:01.906
Okay. So he was here

14:01.908 --> 14:05.109
but that means
he doesn't have any supplies.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.911
Over there!

14:06.913 --> 14:09.480
RYDER:
Are those some tracks?

14:11.184 --> 14:14.285
(Sniffing)
That's Jake all right.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.421
Who's this?

14:16.423 --> 14:17.555
(Sniffing)

14:17.557 --> 14:18.323
Some pup?

14:18.325 --> 14:21.059
Ooh, who eats a lot of liver.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.194
Those tracks
should lead us to them.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.495
Let's go.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.697
(Sniffing)

14:25.699 --> 14:28.299
I don't think we can.
They're snowed over.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.903
It'll be hard finding Jake
under all this fresh snow.

14:31.905 --> 14:35.540
No job is too big.
No pup is too small.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.141
(Beeping)

14:37.143 --> 14:39.177
Pups, to the PAW Patroller.

14:39.179 --> 14:42.380
Ryder needs us!

14:42.382 --> 14:43.815

Whoa, whoa!

Whoa!

14:49.823 --> 14:51.489

for action, Ryder sir!

15:09.509 --> 15:10.608
We all know why we're here.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.578
Jake's lost and his tracks
are covered with snow.

15:13.580 --> 15:17.148
We have to find him, fast.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.817
Chase, I'll need
your tracking skills

15:19.819 --> 15:22.587
and police truck to find
Jake's path again.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.922
Chase is on the case.

15:23.924 --> 15:24.656
RYDER:
Great.

15:24.658 --> 15:29.093
And Skye, I'll need you to
search for Jake from above.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.329
This puppy's gotta fly!

15:31.331 --> 15:34.198
Okay. The rest of you can follow
along in the PAW Patroller

15:34.200 --> 15:36.267
in case we need more help.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.970

something that starts with J.

it's gonna hold, Everest.

Ryder, I found Jake
and the pup!

It's the PAW Patrol

There's more than one way
to lift Jake.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.220
Chase, is your winch ready?

Ruff, winch!

18:13.426 --> 18:15.159
Thanks. Skye,

18:15.161 --> 18:17.095
use your wings to fly
the winch line out to Jake.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.931
Chase will pull Jake
and the pup off the bridge.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.899
If they fall,
we can winch them up.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.669
Jake told me all about you.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.438
I better get you two warmed up.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.541
JAKE:
Awesome!

20:10.543 --> 20:11.742
Thanks, Marshall.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.946
Now let's get you inside

20:28.928 --> 20:31.529
Hey, Everest,
what are you gonna do now?

20:31.531 --> 20:36.867
Guess I have to find another way
back to my igloo.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.236
I have an idea.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.372
You know how you said it can be
lonesome out here and all?

20:41.374 --> 20:44.375
Do you want to come back
to Adventure Bay with us?

20:44.377 --> 20:47.011
I could really use
a smart pup like you

20:47.013 --> 20:48.512
to help out on the mountain.

20:48.514 --> 20:49.547
You could?

20:49.549 --> 20:51.115
Oh, yeah!

20:51.117 --> 20:53.884

21:14.741 --> 21:18.242
Are there b-b-bears
around here?

21:18.244 --> 21:20.878
Sorry, that's just
my hungry tummy.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.347
Got any more biscuits?

21:25.918 --> 21:28.352
¶ 83 boxes of treats
on the wall ¶

21:28.354 --> 21:30.221
¶ 83 boxes of treats ¶

21:30.223 --> 21:33.024
¶ Take one down,
pass it around ¶

21:33.026 --> 21:39.630
¶

21:39.632 --> 21:41.198
Thanks for the treats.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.068
And thanks again
for rescuing us, Ryder.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.070
Couldn't have done it
without my pups.

21:46.072 --> 21:49.006
Whenever you're in trouble,
just yelp for help.

21:49.008 --> 21:52.443
Which reminds me, Everest,

21:52.445 --> 21:54.312
I have something for you.

21:54.314 --> 21:54.912
(Gasping)

21:54.914 --> 21:58.516
Everest, for saving Jake
and showing great rescue skills,

21:58.518 --> 22:03.421
I'd like to make you an official
member of the PAW Patrol.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.922
Whoa!

22:04.924 --> 22:07.458
PAW Patrol rocks!

22:07.460 --> 22:09.493
(Cheering)

22:09.495 --> 22:13.397
I don't know what to say
except thanks, Ryder.

22:13.399 --> 22:14.432
Thanks, pups.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.867
Best day ever, ever!

22:16.869 --> 22:18.269
(Growling)

22:18.271 --> 22:20.037
Was that thunder?

22:20.039 --> 22:24.575
Nope, my tummy again.
I'm kind of hungry all the time.

22:24.577 --> 22:25.643
(Growling)

22:25.645 --> 22:27.244
(Laughing)

22:27.246 --> 22:30.314
Wait, let me get
another marshmallow.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.385
A little help?

22:34.387 --> 22:36.887
I got this.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.794
Best rescue ever!

22:43.796 --> 22:45.396
(Laughing)

22:45.398 --> 22:50.368
PUP:
Yay!
