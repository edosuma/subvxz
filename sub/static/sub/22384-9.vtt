00:25.440 --> 00:28.360
I called you every night.
Every night for...

00:28.440 --> 00:29.900

00:31.820 --> 00:32.990

00:33.700 --> 00:35.450
Why didn't you tell me you were there?

00:35.530 --> 00:37.890
- That you were okay?
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Hopper]</font> Because I wouldn't let her.

- The hell is this? Where you been?
- Where have you been?

You've been hiding her.

- You've been hiding her this whole time!
- Hey!

00:59.640 --> 01:03.310
- Protecting her! Protecting her?
- Listen. Listen to me.

01:03.390 --> 01:05.690
The more people know about her,
the more danger she's in.

01:05.770 --> 01:07.980
And the more danger
you and your family are in...

01:08.060 --> 01:09.360
So I should be thanking you?

01:09.440 --> 01:13.030
I'm not asking you to thank me!
I'm asking you to try to understand.

01:13.110 --> 01:14.440
I don't! I don't understand!

01:14.530 --> 01:17.360
That's fine. That's fine!
Just do not blame her!

01:17.450 --> 01:19.320
All right? She's upset enough as it is.

I don't blame her! I blame you!

- Get the door, man.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.940
All right, I got the door.

15:50.030 --> 15:52.360
- Ew. Jesus...
- God...

16:08.050 --> 16:09.550
Mike, would you just stop already?

16:09.630 --> 16:11.170
You weren't in there, okay, Lucas?

16:11.260 --> 16:13.590
That lab is swarming
with hundreds of those dogs.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.840
- Demo-dogs!

Listen, dude,

16:19.100 --> 16:20.680
bottom line, you execute it. All right?

16:20.770 --> 16:22.980
Okay, first of all,
this isn't some stupid sports game.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.650
And second, we're not even in the game.
We're on the bench.

16:25.730 --> 16:28.110
<font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font> So my point is...

16:30.900 --> 16:33.820
Right, yeah, we're on the bench,
so, uh, there's nothing we can do.

16:33.900 --> 16:36.120
That's not entirely true.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.370
I mean, these Demo-dogs,
they have a hive mind.

16:39.450 --> 16:41.750
When they ran away from the bus,
they were called away.

16:41.830 --> 16:44.430
- If we get their attention...
- Maybe we can draw them from the lab.

16:44.460 --> 16:45.830
Clear a path to the gate.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.250
Yeah, and then we all die.

16:47.330 --> 16:48.340
That's one point of view.

16:48.420 --> 16:50.460
No, that's not a point of view, man.
That's a fact.

16:50.550 --> 16:51.880
I got it!

16:52.590 --> 16:56.220
This is where the chief dug his hole.
This is our way into the tunnel. So...

16:56.300 --> 16:58.510
Here, right here. This is like a hub.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.470
So you got all the tunnels
feeding in here.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.100
Maybe if we set this on fire...

17:02.180 --> 17:03.230
Oh, yeah? That's a no.

17:03.310 --> 17:06.000
- The mind flayer would call away his army.
- They'd all come to stop us.

17:06.020 --> 17:07.250
- We circle back to the exit.
- Guys.

17:07.270 --> 17:09.210
- By the time they realize we're gone...
- El would be at the gate.

17:09.230 --> 17:12.650
Hey. Hey! Hey! This is not happening.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.800
- But...
- No, no, no, no, no.

17:13.819 --> 17:15.740
No buts. I promised
I'd keep you shitheads safe,

17:15.819 --> 17:17.280
and that's exactly what I plan on.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.240
We're staying here. On the bench.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.540
And we're waiting for the starting team
to do their job.

17:21.619 --> 17:22.660

17:22.700 --> 17:24.369
This isn't a stupid sports game.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.460
