00:00.004 --> 00:01.640
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.659 --> 00:03.198
JUDE: <i>So, you ever
heard of Declan Rivers?</i>

00:03.204 --> 00:05.104
That's who Eminent Power
wants me to play with.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.373
I think you shouldn't
want to do it without me.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.753
JESUS: <i>What am I
supposed to tell people?</i>

00:08.777 --> 00:10.688
That he's an in-class aide
who's there to help you

00:10.712 --> 00:11.955
catch up on everything you've missed.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.180
Why aren't you in class?
You're late. Let's go.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.948
It's easier to be alone than it is

00:15.983 --> 00:18.817
to constantly be misunderstood.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.287
- We've been, uh...
- We've been doing this wrong.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.167
You used to do that all the
time when we were married.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.569
You'd forget to breathe. It used
to scare the bejesus out of me.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.126
XIMENA: Real enemies of free speech

00:28.161 --> 00:29.895
are flame throwers.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.429
<i>Like Shiloh McCullon.</i>

00:31.465 --> 00:33.264
Honestly, I don't see how I could

00:33.300 --> 00:34.800
finish my portfolio in time

00:34.835 --> 00:36.312
with everything that's
going on with Ximena.

00:36.336 --> 00:38.870
My DACA hasn't been renewed yet.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.206
- What is this?
- That's apology fruit.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.575
Just thought you should know
that Olivia and I broke up.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.277
Is there any way you'd
give me another chance?

00:46.313 --> 00:48.279
MARIANA: <i>Do I have to answer you now?</i>

00:48.315 --> 00:51.082
DREW (ON PA): <i>Students have voted
"no" to Anchor Beach Academy.</i>

00:51.118 --> 00:52.817
(CHEERING)

00:52.852 --> 00:55.120
Board still has the final vote tomorrow.

00:55.155 --> 00:57.422
EMMA: <i>Has Nick texted you again?</i>

00:57.457 --> 00:59.537
- MARIANA: <i>I texted him.</i>
- EMMA: <i> Mariana, seriously?!</i>

01:05.164 --> 01:07.197
CALLIE: So you don't wanna just barge in

01:07.233 --> 01:08.465
and disrupt her speech.

01:08.501 --> 01:09.533
Why not?

01:09.568 --> 01:12.737
Well, because then it becomes a...

01:12.772 --> 01:16.173
"Radical Protesters Interrupt
Shiloh McCullon Event... "

01:16.208 --> 01:18.742
Yeah, and we wanna use
all the press she gets

01:18.777 --> 01:20.710
to draw attention to Ximena's situation.

01:20.746 --> 01:23.480
Right? To put pressure on
Immigration to give her a hearing.

01:23.516 --> 01:25.616
A detention hearing?

01:25.651 --> 01:27.751
No, a hearing to delay any actions

01:27.786 --> 01:29.686
until my DACA status is decided.

01:29.721 --> 01:31.821
She can at least get out of this church

01:31.857 --> 01:33.257
until they figure everything out.

01:33.292 --> 01:36.626
Okay, but Shiloh's supporters
don't give a damn about Ximena.

01:36.662 --> 01:37.794
They want to end DACA,

01:37.829 --> 01:39.869
and deport every undocumented
person in the country.

01:39.898 --> 01:42.666
Right, which is why we need press

01:42.701 --> 01:44.668
that goes beyond her audience.

01:44.703 --> 01:47.403
We need something that's gonna resonate,

01:47.438 --> 01:48.805
you know, in a positive way.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.373
I don't want you guys doing anything

01:50.408 --> 01:51.907
that'll get you arrested.

01:51.942 --> 01:53.409
I mean it, Sean.

01:53.444 --> 01:55.411
Don't lose your shit
and do something stupid.

01:55.446 --> 01:56.512
I won't.

01:57.882 --> 01:59.114
And you,

01:59.150 --> 02:01.128
I mean, now that you've
applied to your art school,

02:01.152 --> 02:02.485
you can't just focus on me.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.253
You gotta get that portfolio done.

02:04.289 --> 02:06.355
- I am!
- Well, how's it coming?

02:06.391 --> 02:08.723
Good. Promise.

02:11.662 --> 02:12.728
<i>(DOOR CLOSES)</i>

02:12.763 --> 02:13.929
Stef!

02:13.964 --> 02:16.531
Hi! I... I... I just
wanted to drop this off

02:16.567 --> 02:19.101
as a thank you for checking
in on Logan over the weekend.

02:19.136 --> 02:20.435
Oh, thank you very much.

02:20.470 --> 02:21.950
It was... it was really not a problem.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.674
Dean and I had a great weekend away.

02:25.709 --> 02:27.576
It was just what we needed to, you know,

02:27.611 --> 02:30.212
reconnect and... and get back on track.

02:30.247 --> 02:31.813
- So...
- Good!

02:31.848 --> 02:35.183
That's good! I'm... I'm
glad you had a great time.

02:35.219 --> 02:38.086
So, do you and Lena have
any plans for your birthday?

02:38.121 --> 02:40.554
It is your birthday
this weekend, isn't it?

02:40.590 --> 02:42.023
Yeah, it... it is.

02:42.058 --> 02:43.736
How did... How'd...
how'd you remember that?

02:43.760 --> 02:45.860
(LAUGHS) I guess I'm just
good that way, I guess.

02:45.895 --> 02:48.029
Um, but if you're not doing anything,

02:48.064 --> 02:49.463
Dean and I would love to,

02:49.498 --> 02:50.576
you know, take you out to dinner.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.233
Or... (CHUCKLES)

02:52.268 --> 02:54.102
- I don't know.
- Well, that... (LAUGHS)

02:54.137 --> 02:56.204
That's very sweet just Lena and I are...

02:56.239 --> 02:58.239
got a little something in the backyard.

02:58.274 --> 02:59.607
That, um...

02:59.642 --> 03:00.708
My friend, Jenna,

03:00.743 --> 03:01.920
her birthday is the day after mine,

03:01.944 --> 03:03.589
so we kinda always do a
little something together,

03:03.613 --> 03:05.412
but it's usually mostly her friends.

03:05.448 --> 03:07.348
But please! You... you
guys should come by.

03:07.383 --> 03:09.950
Bring Logan, of course, you know, um...

03:09.985 --> 03:11.552
I will warn you, however,

03:11.587 --> 03:13.854
that it normally ends up
being mostly gay women.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.722
- (STEF LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
- We'd love to!

03:18.894 --> 03:20.227
LENA: Nick.

03:20.262 --> 03:22.573
I was told you have information
that can save Anchor Beach.

03:22.597 --> 03:24.131
Is that true?

03:24.166 --> 03:25.531
I don't, uh...

03:25.567 --> 03:26.845
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:26.869 --> 03:29.002
You don't?

03:29.037 --> 03:30.436
These texts say otherwise.

03:32.741 --> 03:35.286
Contacting my daughter is a
violation of the restraining order,

03:35.310 --> 03:36.542
not to mention, your parole.

03:36.578 --> 03:39.612
- I just wanted to help.
- Help save the school? Really?

03:39.648 --> 03:41.247
Do you have something?

03:41.283 --> 03:43.483
Or were you just trying to
lure Mariana here to see you?

03:45.119 --> 03:46.718
I have something.

03:48.022 --> 03:49.488
You better...

03:49.523 --> 03:51.843
or I'm sending these texts
straight to your parole officer.

Everything you need is on this.

You could've just
emailed this to Mariana.

I'm not allowed Internet access.

04:42.208 --> 04:43.607
The file's too big to text.

04:43.643 --> 04:45.754
- Mariana doesn't want to see you.
- I just want to apologize.

04:45.778 --> 04:47.778
She doesn't want to see you!

04:47.814 --> 04:49.112
She's made that very clear!

04:50.750 --> 04:51.982
I know.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.418
And I understand why.

04:56.488 --> 04:59.022
I am truly sorry

04:59.058 --> 05:01.024
that I brought a gun into your house.

05:01.060 --> 05:02.993
First you brought a gun into the school.

05:03.028 --> 05:04.394
Then, you broke into my house,

05:04.429 --> 05:06.407
- and you laid in wait.
- I was never gonna hurt her!

05:06.431 --> 05:08.765
You threatened to kill yourself
in front of my daughter.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.266
You completely traumatized her,

05:10.301 --> 05:11.501
and you keep traumatizing her.

05:11.536 --> 05:12.569
I'm sorry.

05:13.638 --> 05:15.238
(SIGHS) If you were truly sorry,

05:15.273 --> 05:16.753
you would stop trying to contact her.

05:18.009 --> 05:19.509
My dad's gonna kill me...

05:20.679 --> 05:21.878
for giving you that.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.082
Nick, your father is
part of the problem.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.683
He's a bully.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.886
He's abusive and now, he's your jailer?

05:30.955 --> 05:32.454
You need to talk to your therapist,

05:32.490 --> 05:34.090
your... your parole officer, someone.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.058
- There is no one.
- What about your mother?

05:42.065 --> 05:44.132
I destroyed the model.

05:45.903 --> 05:47.302
At the school.

05:49.139 --> 05:52.107
- How?
- He took me there one day after therapy.

05:53.143 --> 05:54.610
I said I had to go to the bathroom.

05:56.113 --> 05:57.579
And I smashed it.

05:57.615 --> 06:00.015
- Why?
- Because I hate him.

06:07.124 --> 06:08.124
Hey, Taylor!

06:08.158 --> 06:11.226
- So, I met Declan.
- Good for you.

06:11.261 --> 06:13.761
Yeah, but check this out.

06:13.797 --> 06:15.240
I told him I wouldn't game without you,

06:15.264 --> 06:17.097
so he got Eminent Power to sign you too.

06:19.436 --> 06:20.668
What? Aren't you stoked?

06:20.703 --> 06:22.303
I thought that's what you wanted...

06:22.338 --> 06:24.639
You don't really want me to do this.

06:24.674 --> 06:26.507
You just did it because
I made you feel bad.

06:26.543 --> 06:28.976
(SCOFFS) That's not true.

06:29.011 --> 06:31.878
I mean, yeah, you did
make me feel like a jerk,

06:31.914 --> 06:34.915
but I kinda was being a jerk.

06:34.951 --> 06:37.717
Please? It won't be
the same without you.

06:39.989 --> 06:41.922
Okay, but...

06:41.958 --> 06:44.224
won't I just be, like, the third wheel?

06:44.260 --> 06:45.559
I won't let that happen.

06:45.594 --> 06:47.727
You will not be left out. I promise.

06:47.763 --> 06:49.603
And Declan's super cool.
You're gonna love him.

06:50.933 --> 06:52.198
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) Okay.

06:59.575 --> 07:01.007
Where is she?

07:01.042 --> 07:03.176
- Hey!
- Hey.

07:03.211 --> 07:04.643
Haven't seen you since...

07:04.679 --> 07:07.213
Since you gave her an
apology fruit salad?

07:10.585 --> 07:11.750
Do you wanna go out with me?

07:11.786 --> 07:14.153
Well, why don't you ask me and find out?

07:14.189 --> 07:16.289
So... so you wanna go out with me?

07:17.525 --> 07:20.626
Uh... how about tomorrow night?

07:20.661 --> 07:23.195
No, I... I can't.
It's my mom's birthday.

07:23.230 --> 07:25.965
- What about Saturday?
- I'm working Saturday.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.600
Sunday?

07:27.635 --> 07:29.935
Teaching Pilates on Sunday.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.203
Wait, you teach Pilates?

07:31.238 --> 07:33.739
Yeah. Why?

07:33.774 --> 07:35.107
No reason, I guess.

07:35.142 --> 07:36.942
Well, how 'bout this?

07:36.978 --> 07:39.478
You tell me whenever you
figure out your schedule,

07:39.513 --> 07:41.146
- when you wanna plan something.
- Deal.

07:46.553 --> 07:49.254
Huh! Nicely played.

07:49.289 --> 07:51.456
So what? You've decided on Wyatt?

07:51.492 --> 07:53.892
No. I've decided that
I don't need to decide.

07:53.927 --> 07:56.360
It's all new, I mean, even with Mat,

07:56.396 --> 07:58.195
even though he's old, it's kind of new,

07:58.231 --> 07:59.664
if you get what I mean.

07:59.699 --> 08:01.110
So I don't have to be
exclusive to anyone.

08:01.134 --> 08:03.300
So, are you going to tell them

08:03.336 --> 08:05.336
that you're seeing all of them?

08:06.372 --> 08:08.105
I don't see why I have to.

08:08.141 --> 08:09.821
It's not like they run
in the same circles.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here

08:21.487 --> 08:23.554
Anyone seen Lena?

08:23.589 --> 08:26.057
- DREW: Not yet.
- She doesn't get a vote.

08:26.092 --> 08:27.457
We've got all the votes we need,

08:27.492 --> 08:28.992
so this is just a formality.

08:29.028 --> 08:30.627
- Let's do it.
- Alright.

08:34.131 --> 08:35.631
Hey, what happened?

08:35.668 --> 08:36.900
I'll explain later, honey.

08:36.936 --> 08:39.803
LAUREN: All in favor of Anchor
Beach charter dissolving...

08:39.837 --> 08:42.304
LENA: Before you vote, there's
something you need to know.

08:42.340 --> 08:44.207
Is this necessary?

08:44.241 --> 08:45.542
We all know how you feel.

08:45.577 --> 08:47.277
Wait, what's that?

08:47.312 --> 08:50.213
Blueprints for luxury
condominiums on Anchor Beach.

08:52.350 --> 08:55.085
Craig Stratos has no intention
of building a school here.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.553
He just wants the property

08:56.588 --> 08:58.721
so he can build high-end
condos with an ocean view.

09:03.027 --> 09:04.727
Anchor Beach Academy is a total sham.

09:07.832 --> 09:08.864
Okay.

09:11.099 --> 09:13.966
Yes, I had plans drawn up.

09:14.002 --> 09:16.135
As a contingency.

09:16.170 --> 09:18.037
CRAIG: If we want ABA to be great,

09:18.072 --> 09:19.805
we're gonna need a lot of capital.

09:19.841 --> 09:21.674
So, once the vote was settled,

09:21.709 --> 09:24.944
I was gonna present the idea
of relocating the campus.

09:24.979 --> 09:26.546
And developing this property

09:26.581 --> 09:28.480
to fund an endowment for our school.

09:28.516 --> 09:30.315
Don't fall for this.

09:30.351 --> 09:33.419
He saw an opportunity to get his
hands on ocean-front property,

09:33.454 --> 09:35.965
by making promises that I bet my
life he never intended to keep.

09:35.989 --> 09:39.358
There is no reason that
ABA has to be on the beach.

09:39.393 --> 09:41.393
A larger campus would be better,

09:41.429 --> 09:43.095
would allow more room to grow.

09:43.130 --> 09:45.597
We should not let this derail us.

09:45.632 --> 09:47.566
Now that we have full disclosure,

09:47.601 --> 09:49.133
I'm calling the vote.

09:49.169 --> 09:52.336
All those in favor of Anchor
Beach Academy, raise you hand.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.616
MARIANA: You should
have seen Stratos' face

10:19.651 --> 10:20.651
when Mama busted him.

10:20.685 --> 10:22.152
Ooh, very proud of you.

10:22.187 --> 10:23.853
Well, I got a big assist from Mariana.

10:23.889 --> 10:25.622
What's gonna happen to Nick?

10:25.657 --> 10:27.969
Well, I waited with him until
his parole officer showed up.

10:27.993 --> 10:30.394
And then he took him to a halfway house.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.407
And what happens if he
tries to call Mariana again?

10:32.431 --> 10:34.597
Well, I'm getting a new number for one.

10:34.633 --> 10:35.832
Mamas already know.

10:35.867 --> 10:37.044
- That's a good idea.
- MARIANA: Yeah.

10:37.068 --> 10:39.046
And Mariana did the right
thing by coming to me first,

10:39.070 --> 10:40.269
and not going to see Nick.

10:40.305 --> 10:42.338
So let that be a lesson to all of you.

10:43.374 --> 10:44.541
So, is, uh, is that it?

10:44.576 --> 10:48.511
No, actually, we would like to
talk to you guys about Jesus.

10:48.547 --> 10:51.480
We need to change the way
that we've been treating him.

10:51.515 --> 10:53.015
It's called "ableism."

10:53.051 --> 10:55.418
We've been expecting him to
control things that he can't,

10:55.453 --> 10:56.718
and keeping things from him

10:56.754 --> 10:58.065
that we assumed he couldn't handle.

10:58.089 --> 11:00.622
Like what happened with
the treehouse and with Emma.

11:00.658 --> 11:02.224
We were just trying to protect him.

11:02.260 --> 11:03.670
LENA: That's what we
thought we were doing,

11:03.694 --> 11:05.995
but we were actually
just underestimating him.

11:06.030 --> 11:08.163
We weren't letting you be
in charge of your own life.

11:09.299 --> 11:10.398
STEF: So, going forward,

11:10.434 --> 11:13.201
we're all gonna need to be
a little bit more patient,

11:13.236 --> 11:15.604
and honest, understanding.

11:15.639 --> 11:17.706
We're gonna follow your lead, bud,

11:17.741 --> 11:21.343
but, uh, that means that you
gotta let us know what you need.

11:21.378 --> 11:22.678
- Yes?
- Okay.

11:22.713 --> 11:24.312
Okay, back to homework.

11:24.348 --> 11:26.614
Before electronics, please.

11:28.218 --> 11:31.019
Jesus. Just, uh...

11:34.591 --> 11:36.458
I wanted to let you know that I heard

11:36.493 --> 11:37.892
what you said about David

11:37.927 --> 11:40.928
being so awful, and I'm really sorry.

11:40.964 --> 11:42.964
He will not be coming back.

11:42.999 --> 11:46.100
Wait, so no... no para-professional?

11:46.135 --> 11:48.241
Well, you still need someone
to help you manage your homework

11:48.242 --> 11:49.971
- and your classes.
- Can you do it?

11:52.008 --> 11:53.808
Uh... yes.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.210
- Yeah, okay, sure.
- Okay.

11:58.514 --> 11:59.913
- Thanks, Mama.
- Yeah.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.654
You sure you can do your
job and keep an eye on Jesus?

12:07.689 --> 12:10.057
(SIGHS) That's what I should
have been doing all along.

12:10.092 --> 12:12.759
It's unconscionable that they
didn't make you principal.

12:12.794 --> 12:14.360
Tell me about it.

12:14.396 --> 12:16.307
You really think that you
can keep working under Drew?

12:16.331 --> 12:18.131
Yeah, what choice do I have?

12:19.401 --> 12:20.401
What is this?

12:21.770 --> 12:24.437
(SCOFFS) Jenna's list for the party.

12:24.472 --> 12:26.540
(LAUGHS) All women.

12:26.575 --> 12:29.876
- Big surprise.
- I so don't feel like celebrating this year.

12:29.912 --> 12:32.645
I tried to get out of it, but
you know Jen and birthdays.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.514
You invite anyone?

12:34.549 --> 12:36.649
Uh, Tess and Dean.

12:36.684 --> 12:38.723
Just she... (SCOFFS) She
showed up at the front door

12:38.724 --> 12:41.954
with a bottle of wine thanking
us for keeping an eye on Logan,

12:41.989 --> 12:44.090
and then remembered
that it was my birthday.

12:44.125 --> 12:46.070
Asked what we were doing,
you know, what am I gonna say?

12:46.094 --> 12:47.426
They're right next door.

12:47.461 --> 12:49.873
- Dean's gonna be the only guy there except the kids.
- (SCOFFS)

12:49.897 --> 12:51.096
Well, should we invite Mike?

12:51.131 --> 12:52.998

12:53.034 --> 12:54.667
Want me to... to ask Timothy?

had a great time in Cabo,

13:08.282 --> 13:10.148
and... and things are back on track.

13:10.184 --> 13:11.983
Mmm. What does that mean?

13:12.018 --> 13:14.486
I think it means that no matter
what she said to me at prom,

13:14.521 --> 13:17.322
she is not gay or whatever.

13:17.357 --> 13:20.157
I think, really, honestly,
I think she's just having...

13:20.193 --> 13:21.859
a little midlife crisis.

13:21.895 --> 13:23.575
You've cleaned that
pot three times, honey.

13:24.631 --> 13:27.131
Really? Well, it's clean now.

13:27.166 --> 13:28.666
- You coming up?
- Uh, yeah.

and student welfare,

16:07.355 --> 16:08.888
and everything else falls to me.

16:08.923 --> 16:11.390
And I don't want us in
constant disagreement.

16:11.425 --> 16:14.160
We need to present a unified front.

about what you said.

completely start over, then I'm in.

- Sunday?
- Working.

- Two gigs out of town.

you wanna come to my mom's birthday.

- Hey.

17:26.933 --> 17:29.766
This is just a little literature
about traumatic brain injuries,

17:29.802 --> 17:31.879
so you can help better understand
what Jesus is dealing with.

17:31.903 --> 17:33.870
There's also a copy of his 504 plan,

17:33.905 --> 17:35.283
and a list of accommodations as well.

17:35.307 --> 17:37.140
Oh, uh...

17:37.175 --> 17:40.043
What happened to his
para-professional, David?

17:40.078 --> 17:43.747
Uh, he... he didn't work out,
so I'll be assisting Jesus.

17:43.782 --> 17:47.083
Oh! Also, short-term memory
is a problem for Jesus,

17:47.118 --> 17:48.651
so if you could please print out

17:48.686 --> 17:50.186
his homework assignments each day,

17:50.222 --> 17:52.989
and any in-class work
expected for the following day

17:53.024 --> 17:55.058
so he can be prepared,
that'd be really helpful.

17:55.093 --> 17:57.093
Yeah, sure.

Well, I mean, not for all
of them, unfortunately.

18:07.805 --> 18:09.372
I have my own work to do, but...

18:09.407 --> 18:10.784

18:10.808 --> 18:13.008

Some of these gals a
little young for you?

20:40.418 --> 20:42.885
Yeah, well, I read that at our age,

20:42.920 --> 20:44.398
you gotta start making younger friends,

20:44.422 --> 20:46.956
otherwise, when you actually do get old,

20:46.992 --> 20:49.492
everybody you know will be dead.

20:49.527 --> 20:51.461
And then, you'll be all alone.

20:52.697 --> 20:54.630
There's a comforting thought, Jenna.

20:54.665 --> 20:56.665
Mmm. Lighten up.

20:56.701 --> 20:58.100
Have a drink.

20:58.135 --> 21:00.035
I'm gonna go get a drink.

21:00.070 --> 21:02.538
- Do you need anything?
- Uh, no, I'm good for now.

21:02.573 --> 21:03.806
Okay.

21:03.841 --> 21:06.174
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

21:14.985 --> 21:17.085
Oh! Hi!

21:17.121 --> 21:18.286
I'm Jenna.

21:18.322 --> 21:19.854
The birthday girl.

21:19.890 --> 21:21.656
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

21:21.691 --> 21:23.758
Theresa, and happy birthday.

21:23.793 --> 21:25.260
So, are you here for me,

21:25.295 --> 21:26.528
or for Stef?

21:26.563 --> 21:29.464
- Um, Stef.
- Aw, that's too bad.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.933
So, how do you know the
old life of the party?

21:31.968 --> 21:34.068
(LAUGHS) I live next door.

21:34.103 --> 21:36.037
Oh, I see!

21:36.072 --> 21:38.906
Well, the next time I'm visiting,

21:38.941 --> 21:41.075
I might just have to...

21:41.110 --> 21:43.610
stop by, and uh...

21:43.646 --> 21:45.179
borrow a cup of sugar.

21:46.416 --> 21:47.681
(BOTH LAUGH)

21:47.716 --> 21:49.183
Hey, Stef. Happy birthday.

21:49.218 --> 21:52.185
Hey! Thank you.

21:52.220 --> 21:55.121
Sorry that you are
the only male in sight.

21:55.157 --> 21:56.456
- No worries.
- (STEF LAUGHS)

21:56.491 --> 21:59.051
What man wouldn't want to be at
a party full of beautiful ladies?

21:59.929 --> 22:01.161
Yeah.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.463
Um, how was Cabo? Did
you guys have a good time?

22:04.567 --> 22:06.132
Yeah. Great.

22:08.903 --> 22:10.836
- Hey!
- Hey.

22:12.474 --> 22:16.676
So... who did you have
an amazing night with?

22:16.711 --> 22:19.145
- Logan!
- Your mom invited me and my folks.

22:19.181 --> 22:20.913
Oh! I... I didn't know.

22:20.949 --> 22:23.849
- I'm Mat.
- Oh, yeah, I remember you from the prom.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.551
You're the ex-boyfriend, right?

22:27.555 --> 22:28.788
The whole time I'm worried

22:28.823 --> 22:30.223
about Taylor being the third wheel,

22:30.257 --> 22:32.036
and then, suddenly, I'm
the one who's left out?

22:32.060 --> 22:34.326
You gotta stick up
for yourself next time.

22:34.361 --> 22:36.696
Hey, don't be scared to
give it back to Declan.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.097
Make him pay attention to you.

22:40.534 --> 22:43.302
I don't know, dude. She
called the teacher at home.

22:43.337 --> 22:46.305
Okay, I know that she's
trying to help me out and all,

22:46.340 --> 22:49.575
but having a mom in class
is way worse than a para.

22:49.610 --> 22:51.154
Well, remember what Moms said.

22:51.155 --> 22:52.355
I mean, how they're trusting
you to tell them stuff.

22:52.379 --> 22:54.139
How am I supposed to
tell Mama she's bugging?

22:55.382 --> 22:58.883
So, um, what's the deal
with your neighbor, Theresa?

22:58.919 --> 23:00.384
Tell me she's single.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.431
No, she's not single. She's
straight and she's married.

23:02.455 --> 23:05.256
She's... she's married
to that guy... that guy.

23:05.291 --> 23:07.792
And, so? How married is she?

23:07.828 --> 23:09.460
She's married. Married married!

23:09.496 --> 23:11.307
- What do you mean, "How married is she?"
- Oh, please.

23:11.331 --> 23:13.264
I was married married to Kelly.

23:13.299 --> 23:14.599
She was cheating on me!

23:14.634 --> 23:16.434
Yeah, well, go figure.

23:16.469 --> 23:18.869
- Well...
- TESS: Happy birthday!

23:18.904 --> 23:20.904
- Uh, happy birthday, Stef.
- Thank you.

23:20.940 --> 23:23.040
Appreciate it, Tess. You've met Jenna.

23:23.075 --> 23:25.042
Yes! Yes, I have.

23:25.077 --> 23:26.144
Hi.

23:27.247 --> 23:29.346
Uh, is there any more champagne?

23:29.381 --> 23:30.881
- Yeah.
- Oh my God!

23:30.916 --> 23:33.350
Remember that time we got so smashed

23:33.385 --> 23:34.985
at your sixteenth birthday?

23:35.021 --> 23:36.564
- (CHUCKLES)
- That was champagne, right?

23:36.588 --> 23:39.523
- Well... no.
- No, it was Champale.

23:39.558 --> 23:41.959
- Yeah.
- JENNA: Wait, wait.

23:41.994 --> 23:44.028
You two knew each
other when you were 16?

23:44.063 --> 23:46.763
Yeah, we were best
friends for a few years.

23:46.798 --> 23:49.098
- Inseparable really.
- Oh, whoa.

23:49.134 --> 23:51.168
Whoa! Wait!

23:51.203 --> 23:52.969
You're <i> Tess</i> Tess.

23:59.378 --> 24:01.282
I have heard so much about you!

24:01.296 --> 24:02.962
- Really?
- Not that much.

24:02.997 --> 24:04.630
(STEF CLEARS THROAT)

24:04.666 --> 24:07.934
Um, well, you know, it's... it's
getting a little chilly out here,

24:07.969 --> 24:10.703
I think I'll just run
next door and grab a scarf.

24:10.738 --> 24:12.238
- Sure!
- Okay, be sure to come back.

24:12.274 --> 24:13.706
Yes, I will. Oh...

24:13.741 --> 24:15.908
Thanks. Here, hold that.

24:15.944 --> 24:19.078
So that's the Tess you were
in love with in high school.

24:19.113 --> 24:21.914
The one you used to sleep
in the same bed with,

24:21.950 --> 24:25.017
and, okay, that explains
the vibe I was getting.

24:25.053 --> 24:26.452
What vibe is that?

24:26.487 --> 24:28.287
The bi-curious one,

24:28.322 --> 24:30.756
cause she's totally into me.

24:30.792 --> 24:32.224
I can't. I... I can't.

24:35.162 --> 24:38.197
Oh, Logan, will you run to our
house and just grab my scarf?

24:38.232 --> 24:39.731
I think I left it by the front door.

24:41.702 --> 24:43.068
Thank you.

24:46.873 --> 24:48.474
So, that's the "amazing night" guy?

24:50.644 --> 24:51.876
Yes.

24:51.912 --> 24:54.412
But in my defense, I had no
idea he was gonna be here.

24:54.447 --> 24:56.114
His parents are friends with my moms,

24:56.149 --> 24:58.349
- and he lives next door, so...
- Next door?

24:58.384 --> 25:00.051
Great.

25:00.087 --> 25:01.185
WYATT: Hey.

25:02.723 --> 25:03.922
I was just dropping this off.

25:03.957 --> 25:05.077
Your mom told me to come in.

25:06.093 --> 25:07.391
Hey!

25:07.427 --> 25:09.293
- Is that a calendar?
- Yeah.

25:09.329 --> 25:10.794
Yeah, it's a calendar.

25:10.830 --> 25:12.997
You told me to let you know
when I knew my schedule,

25:13.032 --> 25:14.898
so I wrote down
everything that I'm doing

25:14.934 --> 25:16.834
every day for the next 16 months.

25:16.869 --> 25:18.702
"Friday: Save the Dolphins."

"Saturday: Fix Climate Change."

25:20.840 --> 25:22.673
"Sunday... "

25:22.708 --> 25:24.475
- "Mariana Fun Day."
- Yeah.

25:24.511 --> 25:26.710
- Ambitious.
- I like setting the bar pretty high.

- LOGAN: Oh! Hey!
- WYATT: Hey!

25:30.415 --> 25:32.650
- What's your name again? Wilson?
- Wyatt.

25:32.685 --> 25:33.984
Wyatt, right, right.

25:34.020 --> 25:36.353
And you're the pretend
ex from prom, right?

25:36.388 --> 25:37.788
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:37.823 --> 25:39.156

25:39.191 --> 25:41.558
Okay, listen.

25:41.593 --> 25:42.892
All of you asked me out,

25:42.927 --> 25:45.529
and it's all new and
nothing serious yet,

25:45.564 --> 25:48.031
or again, and...

25:48.066 --> 25:50.500
yeah, I... I just... I don't
see why I can't date all of you.

25:50.536 --> 25:53.069
You know? Not like at the same time,

25:53.104 --> 25:54.404
but, like, one on one.

25:59.844 --> 26:01.022
Okay, if you're not cool with that,

26:01.046 --> 26:02.046
I totally understand,

26:02.080 --> 26:04.547
but I just... I'm not
ready to be tied down.

26:04.582 --> 26:06.102
- I'm cool with that.
- Yeah, I'm down.

26:13.858 --> 26:15.391
- Hey.
- Hey!

26:15.426 --> 26:17.159
You taking a break from the party?

26:17.195 --> 26:21.463
Yeah, I, uh, kinda felt
a little out of place.

26:21.499 --> 26:23.098
Well, I'm gonna go change,

26:23.133 --> 26:25.501
and then come back down
and you can hang with me.

26:25.536 --> 26:27.303
Okay.

26:27.338 --> 26:29.672
Um, were you just with Ximena?

26:29.707 --> 26:32.874
No, I was, uh, just doing some work

26:32.910 --> 26:34.876
at the art studio at school.

26:34.912 --> 26:38.313
Wait, isn't she the
one who's against DACA?

26:38.348 --> 26:42.184
Yeah, uh, we're going to an event
of hers tomorrow in Orange County.

26:42.219 --> 26:44.086
Um, why?

26:46.123 --> 26:48.690
Hey, so, um, I need to
talk to you about something.

26:48.725 --> 26:50.991
Nobody wants to go to Drew
about this, because, uh...

26:51.027 --> 26:53.761
- well, nobody likes him.
- (CHUCKLES)

26:53.796 --> 26:56.864
Did you know he was going to initiate

26:56.899 --> 26:58.366
merit-based bonuses?

27:00.370 --> 27:01.536
Unbelievable.

27:01.571 --> 27:03.449
So this is why he called the
board meeting for tomorrow.

27:03.473 --> 27:07.041
Anyway, no one can stand
that son of a bitch, so...

27:07.076 --> 27:09.276
that's why they came to me.

27:09.311 --> 27:12.213
Lena, all the teachers trust you,

27:12.248 --> 27:14.749
and believe in you, but...

27:14.784 --> 27:16.717
you're overstepping.

27:16.753 --> 27:18.385
You can't be a parent,

27:18.420 --> 27:20.454
and an administrator at the same time.

27:20.489 --> 27:22.367
I mean, we wouldn't allow
a parent just to come in

27:22.391 --> 27:23.790
and sit in class with their child

27:23.825 --> 27:25.225
whenever they wanted to.

27:25.261 --> 27:27.527
And what makes it worse is that...

27:27.563 --> 27:28.962
you're our boss.

27:28.997 --> 27:31.376
Okay, well, I'm sorry, but I've
got to do what I have to do here.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.866
I have to fight for my son.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.034
Alright, okay, sure, but...

27:35.070 --> 27:37.503
then why don't you fight for yourself?

27:37.538 --> 27:39.806
- What does that mean?
- You should be principal.

27:39.841 --> 27:41.841
Not Drew. He's a dick!

27:41.877 --> 27:43.909
He almost sold the whole
school down the river.

27:43.944 --> 27:45.477
(STAMMERS)

27:45.512 --> 27:47.112
Why are you standing for this?

27:47.148 --> 27:48.680
I don't have a choice.

27:49.850 --> 27:51.316
I don't think that's true.

27:59.487 --> 28:01.187
I'm sorry, I... I...

28:01.223 --> 28:04.390
can't just, like, pretend I
don't mind you dating other guys.

28:04.426 --> 28:06.626
Especially Wyatt.

28:06.661 --> 28:09.028
And you keep saying we're starting over,

28:09.063 --> 28:12.631
it's all new, but we're not really new.

28:12.666 --> 28:15.034
I already know I love you.

28:15.069 --> 28:17.269
And we've already been, you know,

28:17.304 --> 28:18.304
together.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.406
Once.

28:21.442 --> 28:23.843
Then you dumped me the next
day, right here on this swing.

28:25.613 --> 28:27.479
(SIGHS) Look, Mat...

28:27.514 --> 28:29.348
I'm sorry, I just...

28:29.383 --> 28:32.884
I can't just dive back in.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.854
The only way I'm even willing
to consider this is slowly.

28:35.889 --> 28:39.023
<i>♪ Breathe without you here now... ♪</i>

28:40.394 --> 28:42.728
Okay.

28:42.763 --> 28:46.231
<i>♪ Take it back or walk the other way ♪</i>

28:46.266 --> 28:49.533
<i>♪ Bring me in and let's drift away... ♪</i>

28:49.569 --> 28:51.836
- Fine.
- Oh, come on, guys!

28:51.872 --> 28:53.738
- Stop it!
- Don't be a bummer.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.473
We'll do that later.

28:55.508 --> 28:56.908
Okay, where are my bubbles?

28:56.943 --> 28:59.043
Ooh, I spy bubbles.

28:59.079 --> 29:01.179
- JENNA: Oh, sweet.
- (TESS LAUGHS)

29:01.214 --> 29:02.713
More champagne, Jenna, really?

29:02.749 --> 29:04.749
It's bubbles, Stef.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.317
And hey, don't worry, I didn't drive.

29:06.352 --> 29:07.451
Dean?

29:07.487 --> 29:09.654
Uh, no thank you, I'm pretty good.

29:09.689 --> 29:10.888
I am exhausted.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.122
Let's go upstairs.

29:12.158 --> 29:13.557
We can leave them here. It's fine.

29:13.593 --> 29:14.792
It's not fine.

29:14.827 --> 29:16.938
I have no idea what Jenna's
gonna do when we're not around.

29:16.962 --> 29:18.328
- Alright.
- Whoo.

29:19.331 --> 29:21.364
Stef? Happy birthday.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.366
I... I'm calling it. I got to go to bed.

29:23.402 --> 29:26.469
- Awww.
- Tess, Tess, you should stay.

29:26.505 --> 29:28.738
You know what? I think that
we should all go to bed.

29:28.774 --> 29:29.973
(LAUGHS)

29:30.009 --> 29:32.009
So, how about, um, you all go to bed,

29:32.044 --> 29:33.977
and we all just finish our drinks?

29:34.013 --> 29:35.345
And then we'll let ourselves out?

29:35.380 --> 29:38.748
Jenna, when I say the party's
over, the party's over.

29:38.784 --> 29:40.149
You didn't say the party's over.

29:40.185 --> 29:41.562
You said that everybody
should go to bed.

29:41.586 --> 29:43.026
- Jenna.
- DEAN: Honey, we should go.

29:43.822 --> 29:45.855
It was so nice to meet you, Jenna.

29:45.890 --> 29:48.991
(LAUGHS) We should have dinner sometime.

29:49.027 --> 29:50.660
Um, the three of us, I mean.

29:50.696 --> 29:52.361
Yes! Oh, I would love that.

29:52.396 --> 29:54.663
I don't have many
friends left in San Diego,
