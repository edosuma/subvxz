A series of events
has occurred.

00:04.997 --> 00:06.298
It's been referred to
as "the pattern."

As far as we can tell, the
kidnappers don't even have guns.

Who's the kid?
Tyler carson.
15 years old.

03:18.023 --> 03:21.159
According to nypd,
he disappeared 36 hours ago.

Walter, remember that
conversation we had

03:25.397 --> 03:26.631
About personal space?

03:26.699 --> 03:29.267
I'm bored.

03:29.335 --> 03:30.969
No cadavers
at this crime scene.

Or food.

Walter, they're transferring
the bodies to your lab now.

03:36.475 --> 03:38.443
There's no need-- I've already
formed an hypothesis

03:38.511 --> 03:39.777
As to what happened here.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.746
Mesmerism. Hypnotism.

03:41.814 --> 03:43.848
The victims have obviously
been subjected

03:43.916 --> 03:46.918
To subliminal suggestions
of a violent nature.

03:46.986 --> 03:49.087
Walter, hypnosis can't make you
do anything

03:49.155 --> 03:50.355
That you don't want to do.

03:50.422 --> 03:52.891

The kidnapped kid's father--
he works for fleming-monroe.

03:56.328 --> 03:59.264
The aerospace division
of massive dynamic.

03:59.331 --> 04:03.201
I already have a call in
to nina sharp.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.454
Ms. Sharp's office is
right this way.

04:23.522 --> 04:26.090
Dr. Carson is in there
waiting with her now.

04:31.864 --> 04:35.934
Uh, miss?

04:36.001 --> 04:39.671
The screen in the elevator said
there are 73 laboratories.

04:39.738 --> 04:40.939
Is--is that right?

04:41.006 --> 04:42.640
Yes.

04:42.708 --> 04:45.343
<i>Ms. Sharp's office is
right this way.</i>

04:45.411 --> 04:46.844
It's amazing.

04:51.817 --> 04:54.118
Dr. Carson, why didn't you
call the police sooner?

04:54.186 --> 04:55.787
I didn't even know
he was gone

04:55.854 --> 04:57.655
Until I got the call
from them--

04:57.723 --> 05:00.558
The men who took him.

05:00.626 --> 05:02.961
Tyler and I don't talk much.

05:03.028 --> 05:06.464
I--I just figured
it's because of his age.

05:06.532 --> 05:09.801
You know what teens
are like.

05:09.868 --> 05:12.604
I guess that's just
an excuse, isn't it?

05:16.242 --> 05:19.277
So what did
the kidnappers say?

05:19.345 --> 05:22.413
Just to wait
for further instruction.

05:22.481 --> 05:24.649
Ms. Sharp, the two men
identified in those photographs,

05:24.717 --> 05:26.184
Are you absolutely certain

05:26.252 --> 05:28.820
They have no connection
to your company?

05:28.887 --> 05:30.154
(nina)
yes, we cross-referenced
their names

05:30.222 --> 05:31.556
With our employee database.

05:31.624 --> 05:33.858
Patrick hickey and tom dobbins
have never worked for us,

05:33.926 --> 05:35.860
And they've had
no peripheral involvement

05:35.928 --> 05:37.328
With any of our clients
or partners.

05:37.396 --> 05:40.131
<i>According to the police,
they're used car salesmen.</i>

05:40.199 --> 05:42.133
And there's been no indication
of their demands?

05:42.201 --> 05:43.601
No, not yet.

05:43.669 --> 05:46.437
So is it possible
that these men are trying

05:46.505 --> 05:48.640
To extort secrets
from massive dynamic?

05:48.707 --> 05:51.042
We have come
to the same conclusion.

05:51.110 --> 05:56.481
Well, would you care to share
what kind of secrets?

05:56.548 --> 06:02.754
Dr. Carson performs sensitive

<i>It's the only--</i>

06:15.834 --> 06:19.604
Tyler's mother died
when he was just a boy.

06:19.672 --> 06:23.841
And now if--
if I lose him,

06:23.909 --> 06:27.011
I don't know what
I'd do.

06:30.349 --> 06:33.117
I'll get him.
Excuse me.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.322
Dr. Carson, we will do
everything we can

06:38.390 --> 06:40.291

What are you doing?

06:45.030 --> 06:47.331
Massive dynamic...

06:47.399 --> 06:50.534
It was just a name
until now.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.706
Did you know that I once
shared a laboratory

06:55.774 --> 06:57.441
With william bell?

06:57.509 --> 07:00.811
You might have mentioned that
once or twice.

07:02.879 --> 07:04.983
Look how much he's achieved.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.792
You know, he introduced me
to her.

07:14.860 --> 07:15.926
To whom?

07:15.994 --> 07:19.063
Your mother.

07:19.131 --> 07:22.170
After the neurobiology
conference in berlin.

07:25.937 --> 07:27.571
It was our idea,
you know,

07:29.789 --> 07:31.709

would one day

07:31.777 --> 07:33.014
Form a company together.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.417
He just couldn't wait,
I suppose.

07:43.388 --> 07:45.790
But thankfully
she was still there for you

07:45.857 --> 07:48.192
While I was gone.

07:54.397 --> 07:55.699
I'm hungry.

Just do it,

08:15.620 --> 08:18.155
Hey, buddy, is there
gonna be a problem here?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.927
You really don't want
to get involved in this.

08:22.994 --> 08:26.297

as a convenience store clerk.

09:49.897 --> 09:51.197
Any witnesses?

09:51.265 --> 09:52.932
Both victims are
in intensive care

09:53.000 --> 09:54.434
At university hospital.

So no statements
anytime soon.

09:56.503 --> 10:00.573
Stealing food and knocking over
convenience stores?

10:00.641 --> 10:01.974

10:16.523 --> 10:18.057
Well, maybe
your father's right.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.993
Maybe one or both of them
are controlling people

10:21.061 --> 10:23.029
Through hypnotic
suggestion.

10:23.097 --> 10:24.330
Then they could just get the
clerk to give 'em the cash.

10:24.398 --> 10:25.498
Why all the carnage?

10:25.566 --> 10:27.700
Maybe they're silencing
the witnesses.

10:27.768 --> 10:29.535
They don't want us to know
how it works.

About these two guys?

10:43.784 --> 10:44.851
<i>(broyles)

10:44.918 --> 10:46.519
The owner was
completely mystified

10:46.587 --> 10:48.187
As to how they got
mixed up in this.

10:48.255 --> 10:49.822
Says they each made a sale
that morning,

10:49.890 --> 10:51.424
Took one of his loaner cars
out for lunch,

10:51.492 --> 10:52.692
And never came back.

10:52.759 --> 10:56.662
Okay.

No criminal record.

11:02.136 --> 11:04.971
<i>(olivia)
so how do these two
become kidnappers?</i>

11:05.038 --> 11:06.272
<i>(peter)
you think they could be spies?</i>

11:06.340 --> 11:08.341
Maybe they're hiding out
in plain sight.

11:08.408 --> 11:12.011
Foreign intelligence agents
often take mundane jobs

11:12.079 --> 11:15.181
So they can blend in while
they're gathering information.

11:15.249 --> 11:16.349
There's certainly
nothing more mundane

11:16.416 --> 11:18.050
Than being a used car
salesman.

11:18.118 --> 11:19.285
So throw in massive dynamic

11:19.353 --> 11:20.887
And your father's theory
on hypnotism

11:20.954 --> 11:22.622

11:31.798 --> 11:34.800
What do you think,

11:34.868 --> 11:37.203
Truthfully, I don't really
spend a lot of time

11:37.271 --> 11:39.272
Thinking about what
human brains would taste like.

11:39.339 --> 11:41.407
Then why did you ask?
[bone saw grinds]

11:41.475 --> 11:44.710
I was asking what
you expected to find

11:44.778 --> 11:46.846
<i>With this brain.</i>

11:46.914 --> 11:48.948
Oh. And normally

11:49.016 --> 11:53.452
Hypnosis would simply...
[grunts]

11:53.520 --> 11:56.656
Boost the alpha wave
of the brain

11:56.723 --> 12:00.693
With no visible effect.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.796
But given the extreme nature
of the suggestions

12:03.864 --> 12:05.965
In this policewoman's case,

12:06.033 --> 12:11.370
I suspect there might be
lesions on the brain.

12:11.438 --> 12:15.241
And visible damage.

12:15.309 --> 12:16.576
[metal clangs]

12:16.643 --> 12:19.579
Oh, yes...

12:19.646 --> 12:22.748
Oh, my.

12:22.816 --> 12:25.818
Thank you.

12:25.886 --> 12:30.756
Now, this is not hypnosis.
It is mind control.

12:30.824 --> 12:32.658
There's a difference?
Oh, yes.
Peter was right.

12:32.726 --> 12:34.727
Hypnosis can only go
so far--

12:34.795 --> 12:36.529
Suggesting,
but not forcing behavior.

12:36.597 --> 12:40.166
Look, look, look.

12:40.234 --> 12:42.335
Hematomas on the brain matter.

12:42.402 --> 12:45.137
Indicating actual trauma.

12:45.205 --> 12:48.207
The result of conflicting
neural impulses.

12:48.275 --> 12:50.876
A conflict of mind
and body.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.345
Is that what killed them?

12:52.412 --> 12:54.013
Oh, no, no, no.
No...

12:54.081 --> 12:55.948
The bullet took care
of that.

12:56.016 --> 13:01.254
(walter)
no, but mind control
could cause brain damage.

13:01.321 --> 13:04.490
I theorize that
the power operates

13:04.558 --> 13:05.891
Through the cochlear nerve.

13:05.959 --> 13:06.959
You mean sound.
Yes.

13:07.027 --> 13:10.596
An auditory trance
is a far more effective

13:10.664 --> 13:12.999
Path manipulation
than the other senses.

13:13.066 --> 13:16.135
But again, it's just
a hypothesis.

13:16.203 --> 13:17.770
Even if we find out
where they are,

13:17.838 --> 13:18.971
Nobody can get near them

13:19.039 --> 13:20.539
As long as they have
this talent.

13:20.607 --> 13:21.874
Then I need you to
work out how to block it.

13:21.942 --> 13:24.110
The ransom call could come
at any minute,

13:24.177 --> 13:28.014
And we need to be ready.
Right. Right. Right.

13:28.081 --> 13:30.516
I don't understand.
Why are we just standing around?

13:30.584 --> 13:33.352
Shouldn't we do something?
Dr. Carson...

13:33.420 --> 13:36.922
I have my very best agents
on the case.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.625
But you need to be here
when the kidnappers call.

13:39.693 --> 13:40.993
[knock on door]

13:41.061 --> 13:42.495
Special agent broyles?

13:42.562 --> 13:44.997
<i>We've just received a call
for dr. Carson.</i>

13:45.065 --> 13:48.034
<i>It's his son.</i>

13:50.404 --> 13:52.371
We're ready,
sir.

13:56.910 --> 13:59.145
Hello?

13:59.212 --> 14:00.813
<i>(tyler)
dad...It's me.</i>

14:00.881 --> 14:02.915
Tyler, are you okay?

14:02.983 --> 14:04.550
<i>Just give them what they want.
Please.</i>

14:04.618 --> 14:06.052
<i>(man)
you've seen that
we won't hesitate to do</i>

14:06.119 --> 14:08.054
<i>Whatever's necessary in order
to get what we want.</i>

14:08.121 --> 14:10.556
Please, listen, I'll do anything
you need--anything!

14:10.624 --> 14:13.592
<i>(man)
$2 million, unmarked bills.</i>

14:13.660 --> 14:16.195
The industrial park off I-78,
western newark airport.

14:16.263 --> 14:17.530
<i>5:00 p.M.</i>

14:17.597 --> 14:19.865
<i>If you're even a minute late,
your son dies.</i>

14:19.933 --> 14:21.334
No, please, listen--
[dial tone]

14:21.401 --> 14:23.602
Tyler?

14:31.778 --> 14:33.879
Money?

14:33.947 --> 14:36.282
All they want is money?

14:36.350 --> 14:38.918
I can sell the house.
Cash in my stock options...

14:38.985 --> 14:41.754
Massive dynamic will cover
any ransom.

14:41.822 --> 14:43.522
They're trying to squeeze a
major international corporation

14:43.590 --> 14:45.358
With a kidnapping.

14:45.425 --> 14:46.425
It doesn't add up.

14:46.493 --> 14:50.429
Money's the distraction.

14:50.497 --> 14:52.164
They want something else.

14:52.232 --> 14:54.900
<i>(olivia)
they took your son
for a reason.</i>

14:54.968 --> 14:56.035
So what now?

14:56.103 --> 14:58.304
We set a trap.

15:01.048 --> 15:02.849
Â¶ have you any wool? Â¶

15:02.917 --> 15:04.584
Â¶ yes, sir, yes... Â¶

15:04.652 --> 15:07.988
Peter, we're running
out of time.

15:08.055 --> 15:10.724
You don't have any idea
what your father's looking for?

15:10.791 --> 15:14.027
No. He just muttered something
about my childhood.

15:16.764 --> 15:19.699
Aha.

15:19.767 --> 15:21.434
Here it is.

15:23.972 --> 15:26.473
It generates white noise,

15:26.541 --> 15:29.877
Which simulates the sound
of being in utero.

15:29.945 --> 15:33.681
[pulsating white noise]
huh? Huh?

15:33.748 --> 15:35.816
Just what we need
to block the mind control.

15:35.884 --> 15:38.218
<i>(peter)
a teddy bear versus
mind control spies?</i>

15:38.286 --> 15:41.822
Bad guys
don't stand a chance.

15:41.890 --> 15:43.324
(olivia)
dr. Carson will meet
the kidnapper

15:43.391 --> 15:44.625
With the briefcase.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.728
So take no action
until the exchange is complete.

15:47.796 --> 15:49.596
We want clean shots only.

15:49.664 --> 15:51.065
<i>We want them alive,
if possible.</i>

15:51.132 --> 15:53.067
But the boy's safety
comes first.

15:53.134 --> 15:54.668
This is exciting.

15:54.736 --> 15:58.172
You think the fbi will
ever give me a gun?

15:58.239 --> 16:01.041
Dr. Bishop will now explain
how to use the equipment

16:01.109 --> 16:02.209
That you've
been provided.

16:02.277 --> 16:03.677
Yes.

16:03.745 --> 16:07.414
Hello.
I am dr. Walter bishop.

16:07.482 --> 16:10.084
You've been given a set
of audio-adapting earphones

16:10.151 --> 16:12.186
<i>Like this,</i>

16:12.253 --> 16:15.556
Which will give off
a steady stream of white noise.

16:15.623 --> 16:16.991
The headphones will make it
so the kidnappers can't

16:17.058 --> 16:18.759
Control you with sound.

16:18.827 --> 16:22.296
<i>Now, put 'em on.
We gotta do a sound check.</i>

16:23.765 --> 16:25.299
[white noise pulsating]

16:25.367 --> 16:28.435
My son peter's teddy bear
emits a sound...

16:28.503 --> 16:33.640
[white noise pulsating]

16:33.708 --> 16:36.477
<i>(walter)
as you listen, you may feel a
sense of deep tranquility,</i>

16:36.544 --> 16:39.380
<i>As if you returned
to your mother's womb.</i>

16:39.447 --> 16:40.681
Um, walter, I think
you're gonna need this.

16:40.749 --> 16:44.318
Thank you, peter.

16:44.386 --> 16:46.553
You will now be able
to hear my voice.

16:46.621 --> 16:48.822
<i>Each of your team leaders
will have a microphone</i>

16:48.890 --> 16:50.224
<i>Like this one.</i>

16:50.291 --> 16:52.459
You will not be able
to communicate

16:52.527 --> 16:54.361
With each other directly.

16:54.429 --> 16:57.564
All commands will come
through the headphones.

16:57.632 --> 16:59.967
<i>Once you're given the order
to put on the headphones,</i>

17:00.035 --> 17:02.269
<i>Do not remove them
under any circumstances.</i>

17:02.337 --> 17:05.939
<i>If you do, you may die
a gruesome and horrible death.</i>

17:06.007 --> 17:10.477
<i>Thank you for your attention.
And have a nice day.</i>

17:21.689 --> 17:25.224
<i>(agent)
alpha team in position.</i>

17:25.292 --> 17:28.729
<i>(second agent)
bravo team in position.</i>

17:32.700 --> 17:34.568
<i>Agent dunham,
we have a brown sedan</i>

17:34.636 --> 17:35.969
<i>Entering in
on the north side.</i>

17:36.037 --> 17:37.504
Do you see tyler
in the vehicle?

17:37.572 --> 17:41.141
<i>That's a negative.</i>

17:41.209 --> 17:43.777
All teams stand by
and hold position.

17:46.581 --> 17:49.883
Bravo team,
what's your status?

17:49.951 --> 17:52.352
<i>(agent)
we have somebody moving in
on foot.</i>

17:52.420 --> 17:55.422
<i>(agent)
copy that. Possible suspect
en route to dr. Carson.</i>

17:55.490 --> 17:57.091
All units,
headphones on.

17:57.158 --> 17:59.059
<i>(olivia)
team leaders,
move communication</i>

17:59.127 --> 18:01.929
<i>To microphones.</i>

18:05.200 --> 18:10.804
[white noise pulsating]

18:12.807 --> 18:13.907
<i>(olivia)
contact made.</i>

18:13.975 --> 18:17.077
Can anyone see the hostage?

18:17.145 --> 18:18.946
<i>This is alpha leader.
Negative.</i>

18:19.013 --> 18:20.614
<i>I've got nothing.</i>

18:20.682 --> 18:24.852
<i>Bravo.
Negative on my end too.</i>

18:24.919 --> 18:28.355
All units, move! Move!

18:28.423 --> 18:33.560
[pulsating white noise]

18:54.516 --> 18:58.519
[pulsating white noise]

19:09.030 --> 19:11.598
[speech inaudible]
[pulsating white noise]

19:31.217 --> 19:32.852
<i>[white noise stops]
help me!</i>

19:33.920 --> 19:34.622
[trigger clicking]

19:35.690 --> 19:37.624
Help me.

19:54.175 --> 19:56.878
You can lose the stupid
headphones.

19:58.946 --> 20:03.550
They don't work.

20:03.618 --> 20:07.220
Take me to your car.

20:13.060 --> 20:15.127
Agent Balik? This is Agent Dunham. Copy?

20:15.195 --> 20:16.495
<i>(balik)
copy. Go for balik.</i>

20:16.813 --> 20:18.414
Any sign of tyler carson?

20:18.482 --> 20:20.883
<i>Negative.
We did two full sweeps.</i>

20:20.951 --> 20:23.419
<i>This place is abandoned.
Olivia?</i>

20:23.487 --> 20:25.688
Agent dunham.
Where is he?

20:25.755 --> 20:27.356
Tyler? We're still
looking for him, walter.

20:27.424 --> 20:28.958
No, no, no,
I don't mean tyler.

20:29.025 --> 20:30.759
I mean peter.
I thought he was with you.

20:30.827 --> 20:32.995
He's gone.

20:33.063 --> 20:35.030
I can't find him
anywhere.

20:37.467 --> 20:40.102
Uh, has anyone seen
peter bishop?

20:40.170 --> 20:41.337
<i>(man)
I told you,</i>

20:41.404 --> 20:44.106
<i>We were the hostages
in that car.</i>

20:44.174 --> 20:47.877
Tyler carson wanted you
to kidnap him?

20:47.944 --> 20:49.545
I'm saying
he made us do it.

20:49.613 --> 20:51.780
He worked us like puppets.
He forced us to drive.

20:51.848 --> 20:54.083
He made us watch
all those people die!

20:54.151 --> 20:55.751
What about the ransom call?

20:55.819 --> 20:58.254
I told you, he made us say
what he wanted!

20:58.321 --> 21:00.723
How did he do that,
exactly?
I don't know
how he does it.

21:00.790 --> 21:03.859
You think I wanted
to saw off my own finger?

21:03.927 --> 21:06.195
He made me do it
when I tried to get away.

21:06.263 --> 21:08.030
And that friend of yours
you keep talking about.

21:08.098 --> 21:11.433
You better pray
he's not with that kid.

21:17.307 --> 21:20.309
Head hurts pretty bad, huh?
[groans]

21:20.377 --> 21:22.311
That's what happens
when you try to fight it.

21:22.379 --> 21:24.547
I can make it stop
if you do what I say.

21:24.614 --> 21:27.516
[straining]
yes.

21:27.584 --> 21:29.818
[relieved]
oh...Oh....

21:29.886 --> 21:33.088
Keep driving straight.

21:33.156 --> 21:35.558
You know, your father's
worried about you.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.160
Awesome.

21:38.228 --> 21:41.330
Come on, kid, let's pull over
and talk about--

21:41.398 --> 21:44.066
Hey, bad idea!

21:44.134 --> 21:45.968
What are you doing?

21:46.036 --> 21:48.070
Let's see how fast
this piece of junk can go.

21:48.138 --> 21:52.141
[engine revving]

21:55.845 --> 21:57.880
[tires screeching]
kid, you're gonna
get us killed!

22:00.884 --> 22:02.651
[horns honking]

22:06.923 --> 22:10.359
Are you ready to behave?
Yes!

22:10.427 --> 22:12.695
[tires screech]

22:18.668 --> 22:21.237
Just so we're clear...

22:21.304 --> 22:22.838
I can make you do
whatever I want.

22:22.906 --> 22:26.942
I can control all of you,
or just part of you.

22:27.010 --> 22:30.246
You know what, kid...

22:30.313 --> 22:33.015
You're a real
son of a bitch.

22:33.083 --> 22:35.684
<i>(olivia)
it's tyler.
Tyler is the kidnapper.</i>

22:35.752 --> 22:38.654
<i>This was taken from
a traffic cam on I-95.</i>

22:38.722 --> 22:39.888
He's the one
controlling people,

22:39.956 --> 22:41.523
And he's taken peter
hostage.

22:41.591 --> 22:43.092
How could this have happened?

22:43.159 --> 22:45.194
The son of one of your
top scientists

22:45.262 --> 22:47.029
Can control people's minds?

22:47.097 --> 22:49.064
Surely that's not
a coincidence.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.234
That doesn't seem
possible.

22:52.302 --> 22:55.170
But dr. Carson works
in aerospace.

22:55.238 --> 22:57.439
But on one of his projects,
he's been collaborating

22:57.507 --> 22:58.774
With the pharmaceutical
division.

22:58.842 --> 23:00.409
What project?

23:00.477 --> 23:02.711
<i>(nina)
this is our flight
simulation deck.</i>

23:02.779 --> 23:04.847
<i>What you're watching is
a live test</i>

23:04.914 --> 23:07.316
<i>Of our prototype
hands-free guidance system.</i>

23:07.384 --> 23:09.184
<i>(olivia)
hands-free navigation.</i>

23:09.252 --> 23:11.186
<i>So who's controlling
the jet?</i>

23:11.254 --> 23:13.155
<i>(nina)
electrodes in the pilot's
helmet</i>

23:13.223 --> 23:14.757
<i>Are picking up
on his thought patterns,</i>

23:14.824 --> 23:18.927
<i>Which send commands
to an onboard computer.</i>

23:21.598 --> 23:24.566
The pilot has been given
a pharmaceutical enhancement--

23:24.634 --> 23:26.902
A drug to amplify
his brainwaves.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.871
Which makes it easier
for the electrodes

23:28.938 --> 23:30.306
In the helmet
to read them.

23:30.373 --> 23:31.940
<i>(walter)
dr. Carson, did you,
perchance,</i>

23:32.008 --> 23:34.009
Expose your son
to this so-called

23:34.077 --> 23:36.245
Pharmaceutical enhancement?

23:36.313 --> 23:38.681
Massive dynamic has strict
testing protocols.

23:38.748 --> 23:41.383
Family members are absolutely
ruled out as test subjects.

23:41.451 --> 23:44.019
Oh, my god.

23:44.087 --> 23:46.388
I took some samples home
for further research.

23:46.456 --> 23:48.123
Tyler might have
found them.

23:51.294 --> 23:52.428
<i>I got a question.</i>

23:52.495 --> 23:54.396
How far away
can you control people?

23:54.464 --> 23:56.932
You mean, how far
do you have to run?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.300
Nice try.

24:04.074 --> 24:05.708
When did you figure out
that you were able to--

24:05.775 --> 24:07.042
I'm not telling you anything,
all right?

24:07.110 --> 24:08.844
Hey, genius,
the second you took me,

24:08.912 --> 24:10.779
They knew that
you were behind it all.

24:10.847 --> 24:11.914
Whatever.
You had no idea

24:11.981 --> 24:13.415
That I was the one
in charge.

24:13.483 --> 24:14.883
[chuckle]
yeah.

24:14.951 --> 24:16.885
You managed to kidnap
yourself--congratulations.

24:16.953 --> 24:18.654
<i>You're a criminal
mastermind.</i>

24:18.722 --> 24:21.490
Screw you.

24:21.558 --> 24:23.959
You really haven't
thought this out, have you?

24:24.027 --> 24:25.427
I mean, you don't even
have a plan.

24:25.495 --> 24:27.496
Shut up.
You sound just like my father.

24:27.564 --> 24:29.665
Oh, come on.
That's what this is about?

24:29.733 --> 24:31.734
<i>Some sort of vendetta
against your dad?</i>

24:31.801 --> 24:34.770
Do you really think that
you're the first kid

24:34.838 --> 24:36.905
<i>Whose father didn't think
he was good enough</i>

24:36.973 --> 24:40.743
Or smart enough?
Take a number.

24:40.810 --> 24:41.910
(dr. Carson)
but it doesn't make sense

24:41.978 --> 24:44.446
Because even if tyler did
take the drugs,

24:44.514 --> 24:46.949
They're designed to work
on computer systems,

24:47.016 --> 24:48.417
Not on other human beings.

24:48.485 --> 24:49.418
<i>(walter)
the brain is
a computer, doctor.</i>

24:49.486 --> 24:51.320
It's an organic computer.

24:51.388 --> 24:53.088
It can be hijacked
like any other.

24:53.156 --> 24:55.958
So how old is this boy?

24:56.025 --> 24:59.428
15? Still going
through puberty? Yes?

24:59.496 --> 25:01.063
Yes.
Yes!

25:01.131 --> 25:03.732
<i>(walter)
his system flooded
with hormones</i>

25:03.800 --> 25:05.134
<i>Affecting his neural
transmitters.</i>

25:05.201 --> 25:07.970
Opening up the pathways
for the uptake

25:08.037 --> 25:09.938
Of psychoactive
chemicals, yes?

25:10.006 --> 25:11.874
I suppose it's possible.
Yes.

25:11.941 --> 25:13.175
Oh, it is.
It's possible, all right.

25:13.243 --> 25:17.446
And was he, by chance, taking
any prescription medication?

25:17.514 --> 25:19.381
Psychostimulants,
perhaps?

25:19.449 --> 25:22.451
Yes.
Yes!

25:22.519 --> 25:25.320
Tyler was taking medication
for attention deficit disorder.

25:25.388 --> 25:27.156
All right, well, puberty,

25:27.223 --> 25:29.291
A.D.D. Medication,

25:29.359 --> 25:33.529
And an untested
brainwave enhancer.

25:33.596 --> 25:35.397
It's a mind control
cocktail.

25:35.465 --> 25:39.168
Because of this man's inability
to be a proper parent,

25:39.235 --> 25:41.069
His son has kidnapped mine!

25:41.137 --> 25:43.839
Walter!

25:43.907 --> 25:45.741
(peter)
you know, I used to hate
my father too.

25:45.809 --> 25:47.042
I know what it's like.

25:47.110 --> 25:49.144
I need a driver, all right?

25:49.212 --> 25:51.246
Not a big brother.

25:51.314 --> 25:54.516
[police siren blaring]

25:54.584 --> 25:56.318
Don't stop.

25:56.386 --> 25:57.786
Kid, this has been
a ton of fun,

25:57.854 --> 26:00.155
But let's get real here.
It cannot go on forever.

26:00.223 --> 26:04.159
I say it's not even close
to finished.

26:04.227 --> 26:06.862
[siren blaring]

26:06.930 --> 26:08.197
Pull over.

26:17.907 --> 26:19.041
[siren off]

26:19.108 --> 26:20.409
(peter)
let me take care of this.

26:20.477 --> 26:23.245
If you don't, I will.

26:33.323 --> 26:34.690
Evening, officer.

26:34.757 --> 26:37.359
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

26:37.427 --> 26:39.928
Sure.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.368
Put your hands
on the car.

26:46.436 --> 26:47.936
I'm sorry, officer,
did I do something wrong?

26:48.004 --> 26:49.605
I said up against
the car.

26:55.745 --> 26:57.379
You got any kind
of weapon on you,

26:57.447 --> 26:59.548
<i>You should tell me now.</i>

27:20.336 --> 27:23.739
Tyler! Tyler!
Tyler, please.

27:23.806 --> 27:26.375
Do not force me
to shoot this man.

27:26.442 --> 27:28.710
He'll tell them where we are.
They'll try to stop us.

27:28.778 --> 27:31.580
Please! Please!

27:31.648 --> 27:33.048
<i>Come on, tyler.</i>

27:33.116 --> 27:34.683
There's gotta be
another way.

27:38.354 --> 27:42.758
[strained grunts]

27:42.825 --> 27:45.494
Unh!

27:45.562 --> 27:47.029
Something like that?

27:58.030 --> 27:59.530
We lost them at the New Jersey turn pike.

27:59.631 --> 28:01.700
<i>Heading south.
towards swedesboro.</i>

28:01.767 --> 28:03.768
We have a chopper
shadowing the vehicle.

28:03.836 --> 28:06.237
We need all assets rerouted
to that vicinity.

28:06.305 --> 28:07.639
Let me know if you spot him.

28:07.707 --> 28:09.274
Thanks.
Astrid?

28:09.942 --> 28:11.943
You tell the state troopers
if they spot them,

28:12.010 --> 28:13.244
To keep their distance.

28:13.312 --> 28:15.079
Stay just within
visual range.

28:15.147 --> 28:16.881
And make sure they know
that peter is not the target.

28:16.949 --> 28:19.216
Yeah.
[knock on door]

28:19.284 --> 28:23.721
Agent dunham, you're needed
in ms. Sharp's office.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.023
What's wrong?
The director's just
classified tyler carson

28:26.091 --> 28:27.258
As a national
security threat.

28:27.326 --> 28:29.360
Fringe division has been
ordered to stand down.

28:29.428 --> 28:31.462
Any intercept will be handled
by special forces.

28:31.530 --> 28:33.230
But we're the only reason
they have any clue

28:33.298 --> 28:34.298
What's really going on.

28:34.366 --> 28:35.800
How can they
take us off now?

28:35.867 --> 28:37.168
New information has
come to light

28:37.235 --> 28:38.569
About tyler's plans.

28:38.637 --> 28:41.372
Turns out he purchased two
one-way tickets to costa rica,

28:41.440 --> 28:43.407
Which he bought before
abducting peter.

28:43.475 --> 28:44.842
Headquarters believes
the boy may be working

28:44.910 --> 28:46.077
With a foreign handler.

28:46.144 --> 28:48.212
With respect,
all the evidence points

28:48.280 --> 28:49.880
Towards an angry kid.

28:49.948 --> 28:51.449
Best-case scenario, we have
a highly intelligent malcontent

28:51.516 --> 28:52.650
On a killing spree.

28:52.718 --> 28:55.686
Besides, the director
thinks it's worse.

28:55.754 --> 28:57.221
Tyler may have been
recruited to deliver

28:57.289 --> 28:58.823
A multi-million dollar
defense project

28:58.890 --> 29:00.124
To our country's enemies.

29:00.192 --> 29:03.060
"overwhelming force will be
brought to bear if necessary"?

29:03.128 --> 29:04.428
You know what this means.

29:04.496 --> 29:05.663
Peter could be
collateral damage.

29:05.731 --> 29:07.398
<i>But regardless,</i>

29:07.466 --> 29:09.467
We need to contain
the situation on our own

29:09.534 --> 29:12.937
Before it's too late.

29:13.005 --> 29:19.443
[footsteps, door opens]

29:19.511 --> 29:23.547
[door shuts]

29:23.615 --> 29:27.451
Walter?

29:27.519 --> 29:30.488
Have you made
any headway?

29:30.555 --> 29:34.759
I can't lose him again.

29:34.826 --> 29:37.094
Walter...

29:37.162 --> 29:39.964
I know you're worried.
We all are.

29:40.032 --> 29:42.366
But we can get peter back.

29:42.434 --> 29:45.169
We just need you to find a way
to disable tyler.

29:45.237 --> 29:50.141
Peter always helps me.

29:50.208 --> 29:53.344
I don't know what to do.

29:53.412 --> 29:56.781
How do I do this
without peter?

29:56.848 --> 29:58.616
He always helps me.

29:58.683 --> 30:01.218
He helps me too.

30:01.286 --> 30:02.887
But you can do this.

30:08.060 --> 30:12.396
Walter...

30:12.464 --> 30:16.033
I know you're scared.

30:16.101 --> 30:20.337
But you're the only one
that can help him.

30:27.946 --> 30:34.018
Maybe I could use
an emf scrambler

30:34.086 --> 30:37.254
To disrupt his
beta wave transmissions.

30:37.322 --> 30:39.924
Sounds like a good place
to start.

30:41.460 --> 30:43.194
Olivia, I think
I found something.

30:43.261 --> 30:45.563
They just brought
tyler's computer in.

30:45.630 --> 30:47.798
He's been doing
some pretty strange searches.

30:50.502 --> 30:52.336
This is what he was
looking for?

30:52.404 --> 30:54.939
Obituaries
and death notices?

30:55.006 --> 30:59.543
All of women who died
14 years ago in car accidents.

30:59.611 --> 31:03.414
Look, all these women died
in their mid-twenties.

31:03.482 --> 31:04.782
Yeah.

31:04.850 --> 31:08.519
So that would make them what,
about 40 now if they were alive?

31:08.587 --> 31:10.354
What are you thinking?

31:10.422 --> 31:12.389
I don't know yet.

31:12.457 --> 31:13.958
Can you pull up
his most recent search?

31:14.025 --> 31:17.595
Yeah.

31:19.931 --> 31:21.966
(olivia)
what do you know about
renee davies?

31:22.033 --> 31:24.168
Who is she?

31:26.872 --> 31:29.874
[sighs]
she's my ex-wife.

31:29.941 --> 31:31.408
Tyler's mother.

31:33.478 --> 31:34.812
Where'd you find this?

31:34.880 --> 31:38.949
It was on tyler's
computer.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.221
This was a good idea.

31:46.391 --> 31:48.359
Yeah, I was 15 once too.

31:48.426 --> 31:50.661
But I had to talk my way
into places like this.

31:54.799 --> 31:56.167
You know, there are
plenty of easier ways

31:56.234 --> 31:57.368
<i>To get money.</i>

31:57.435 --> 32:00.504
Yeah, but it wouldn't
have been as fun.

32:00.572 --> 32:02.806
Fun?

32:02.874 --> 32:05.242
Faking your kidnapping...

32:05.310 --> 32:07.878
Jacking your dad's company...

32:07.946 --> 32:09.480
Killing cops
and innocent bystanders--

32:09.548 --> 32:11.882
That wasn't part of the plan.
Okay?

32:11.950 --> 32:17.154
They just...
Got in the way.

32:24.496 --> 32:28.599
You know, I get it.

32:28.667 --> 32:30.634
I mean, you wanted
to torture your dad, right?

32:30.702 --> 32:32.303
But the thing just
got away from you.

32:32.370 --> 32:34.572
<i>Blew up in your face.
It's not done yet.</i>

32:37.175 --> 32:42.079
What'd your daddy do
to you anyway?

32:42.147 --> 32:43.814
Didn't pay you enough
attention?

32:43.882 --> 32:45.216
<i>Forgot your birthday?</i>

32:45.283 --> 32:46.650
Didn't play ball with you
enough?

32:46.718 --> 32:48.319
He lied to me
my entire life.

32:48.386 --> 32:50.521
Let's not get dramatic.

32:50.589 --> 32:54.858
He told me my mother was dead.

32:54.926 --> 32:58.696
But you have to understand,
she was a mess.

32:58.763 --> 33:00.164
She was on drugs,
off drugs.

33:00.232 --> 33:02.866
<i>I mean, I never knew
what she was gonna do next.</i>

33:02.934 --> 33:05.469
When tyler was a baby,
she would literally disappear

33:05.537 --> 33:07.137
For weeks at a time.

33:07.205 --> 33:11.375
And then finally she--
she just never came back.

33:11.443 --> 33:12.743
Does tyler know
what happened?

33:12.811 --> 33:14.245
<i>I didn't know!</i>

33:14.312 --> 33:16.780
I--I just always assumed
that she would

33:16.848 --> 33:21.218
End up dead
of an overdose somewhere.

33:21.286 --> 33:24.021
And then when tyler was
old enough

33:24.089 --> 33:25.623
To start asking about her,

33:25.690 --> 33:31.695
I told him that she died
in a car wreck.

33:31.763 --> 33:34.832
I thought it was
for the best.

33:34.899 --> 33:40.437
So he wouldn't know that
his mother abandoned him.

33:41.940 --> 33:44.008
(tyler)
about a month ago

33:44.075 --> 33:46.143
I found my birth certificate.

33:46.211 --> 33:48.112
Learned her name.

33:48.179 --> 33:50.914
<i>And then I tried
to find her.</i>

33:50.982 --> 33:53.884
Guess what I found.

33:53.952 --> 33:56.520
That she was never
really dead at all.

33:56.588 --> 33:59.423
She lives in maryland.

33:59.491 --> 34:01.525
She's some sort of
rehab counselor.

34:01.593 --> 34:03.093
So what, you think
if you find her

34:03.161 --> 34:04.528
The two of you are
just gonna live

34:04.596 --> 34:06.764
<i>Happily ever after?
We're gonna be a family again--</i>

34:06.831 --> 34:09.233
Those cops you killed,
they have families too.

34:09.301 --> 34:11.302
They got wives, the got--
[pained grunts]

34:29.587 --> 34:30.987
<i>That would have been
in your leg</i>

34:31.056 --> 34:33.190
If I didn't need you
to drive.

34:35.659 --> 34:37.860
Let's go.

34:45.670 --> 34:47.603
Okay, we know where
tyler's going.

34:47.672 --> 34:49.907
<i>Please tell me
you've got something better.</i>

34:49.974 --> 34:52.076
To stop him with
than what you're wearing.

34:52.143 --> 34:54.411
Oh, this has nothing to do
with the case.

34:54.478 --> 34:55.813
[whispering]
I don't trust them here.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.916
I think they're trying
to read my thoughts.

34:58.983 --> 35:00.250
Massive dynamic gives me
the creeps too.

35:00.318 --> 35:03.087
According to
dr. Carson's data,

35:03.154 --> 35:05.622
The pilots that were
treated with this drug

35:05.690 --> 35:10.160
Were highly responsive
to magnetic fields.

35:10.228 --> 35:13.230
So we are modifying an
electromagnetic pulse

35:13.298 --> 35:14.365
To target his brainwaves.

35:14.432 --> 35:15.999
What does that mean?

35:16.067 --> 35:17.668
We're gonna crash
his brain.

35:17.736 --> 35:21.438
This device will wipe his brain
of all thought.

35:21.506 --> 35:22.840
Uh, for a short period.

35:22.907 --> 35:24.508
He won't be able to think.

35:24.576 --> 35:26.310
He will become
severely disoriented.

35:26.378 --> 35:27.911
He may even vomit.

35:27.979 --> 35:28.979
Which, hopefully,
will give you

35:29.047 --> 35:30.514
The window you need
to take him down.

35:30.582 --> 35:33.751
Okay, let's pack it up.
We're leaving.

35:33.818 --> 35:35.352
Good.

35:46.598 --> 35:49.199
Renee davies?

35:49.267 --> 35:52.136
Yes. Can I help you?

35:53.705 --> 35:59.743
Mom...It's me, tyler.

35:59.811 --> 36:02.446
Your son.

36:02.514 --> 36:05.916
Oh, my god.

36:08.820 --> 36:12.322
I found you!

36:20.398 --> 36:24.401
Who's this?

36:24.469 --> 36:27.137
You mind if we go inside?

36:27.205 --> 36:30.140
Of course.

36:30.208 --> 36:34.077
Mom, listen, I don't blame you
for leaving, all right?

36:34.145 --> 36:35.913
I blame him.
I don't
understand--

36:35.980 --> 36:37.080
Dad.

36:37.148 --> 36:38.849
He didn't want me
to be with you.

36:38.917 --> 36:42.753
Oh, no, tyler.
It wasn't like that.

36:42.821 --> 36:44.855
But it's okay now.

36:44.923 --> 36:46.256
I'm here.
We can go.

36:46.324 --> 36:50.127
Go?
Go where?

36:50.195 --> 36:52.129
Anywhere.
Another country.

36:52.197 --> 36:55.232
<i>Hey, honey,
what's going on?</i>

36:55.300 --> 36:56.266
Seth.

36:56.334 --> 36:59.403
<i>We have some guests.</i>

36:59.471 --> 37:01.104
Hi.

37:01.172 --> 37:03.006
Who the hell's this?

37:03.074 --> 37:05.676
It's about time for us
to go, tyler--what do you say?

37:07.979 --> 37:11.648
I think I see who's
the problem here.

37:17.322 --> 37:20.858
[straining]
tyler...

37:27.799 --> 37:31.935
Tyler, what are you doing?

37:35.165 --> 37:38.934
You cover the back, 
i'll take the front.

37:47.644 --> 37:50.145
<i>(broyles)
I need to disable tyler now.</i>

37:50.213 --> 37:53.449
No time to wait for dr. Bishop.
I'm going in.

37:53.516 --> 37:54.550
Tyler, it's over!

37:54.617 --> 37:57.286
[electricity crackling]

37:57.354 --> 37:59.488
[grunts]

38:05.161 --> 38:06.795
[gunshot]

38:09.131 --> 38:10.432
We're outta here.

38:10.500 --> 38:11.967
And you're driving.

38:15.805 --> 38:17.172
Sir!

38:17.240 --> 38:19.308
He took peter.
Go after them.

38:19.376 --> 38:21.510
Sir, we need to stop
the bleeding.

38:21.578 --> 38:24.013
<i>(astrid over radio)
agent broyles, dr. Bishop and I
are approaching the house.</i>

38:24.081 --> 38:25.514
The bullet went clean through,
and I said go!

38:25.582 --> 38:26.816
Yes, sir.

38:36.026 --> 38:38.527
Tyler just took off with peter.
Let's go.

38:38.595 --> 38:40.930
[tires screech]

38:46.470 --> 38:48.904
Olivia, is that my car?

38:48.972 --> 38:50.806
It's them.

38:50.874 --> 38:53.676
[tires screech]

38:55.145 --> 38:56.479
If we can disrupt
tyler's brainwaves,

38:56.546 --> 38:58.114
How close do we need to be?

38:58.181 --> 38:59.615
No further than 20 feet.

38:59.683 --> 39:01.717
<i>And the effect will
only last a few seconds.</i>

39:01.785 --> 39:04.987
[beeping]

39:05.055 --> 39:06.288
Ready.

39:06.356 --> 39:07.289
Okay, do it.
Do it now.

39:07.357 --> 39:10.760
[device humming]

39:21.838 --> 39:25.007
(walter)
peter? Peter?

39:25.075 --> 39:29.311
Peter, son...
Are you with me?

39:29.379 --> 39:33.249
<i>Peter, son...</i>

39:33.316 --> 39:36.385
There you are.

39:36.453 --> 39:38.954
That was quick thinking.

39:39.022 --> 39:42.124
You always prove to be
more resourceful

39:42.192 --> 39:43.659
Than I give you credit for.

39:43.727 --> 39:46.462
Is that supposed to be
some sort of compliment?

39:48.865 --> 39:51.801
How's tyler?

39:51.868 --> 39:54.937
He was knocked unconscious
in the crash.

39:55.005 --> 39:57.173
Probably a concussion.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.875
We gave him a sedative
to make sure he stays under.

39:59.943 --> 40:01.977
Agent broyles.

40:05.515 --> 40:08.217
See what happens when you
get out from behind the desk?

40:08.285 --> 40:10.419
I've been shot before.

40:10.487 --> 40:12.188
First time by one
of the good guys, though.

40:12.255 --> 40:15.524
Lucky for me
you're a lousy shot.

40:15.592 --> 40:17.159
The kid wanted to
shoot you in the head.

40:17.227 --> 40:23.466
Lucky for you I was able
to pull it off-center a bit.

40:23.533 --> 40:24.500
You're gonna hold this
over my head

40:24.568 --> 40:25.634
For a long time,
aren't you?

40:25.702 --> 40:30.172
Somehow, you'll
make it up to me.

40:33.043 --> 40:35.344
Okay, thanks, olivia.

40:35.412 --> 40:38.247
Yeah, I'll tell walter.
[beep]

40:38.315 --> 40:41.117
Was I right?

40:41.184 --> 40:44.253
Did tyler lose the power
once the drug wore off?

40:44.321 --> 40:45.888
Yeah, you were right.
Which is a good thing, I guess.

40:45.956 --> 40:48.724
That means he won't do
any time.

40:48.792 --> 40:50.526
Kid goes on a killing spree,
and all they're gonna do is

40:50.594 --> 40:53.496
Make him talk it out
with a bunch of shrinks.

40:53.563 --> 40:54.597
[pained sigh]

40:54.664 --> 40:57.399
How many do you want?

40:57.467 --> 40:59.602
I'm not hungry.

40:59.669 --> 41:01.203
I don't need any crepes.

41:01.271 --> 41:02.972
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

41:03.039 --> 41:07.409
You were abducted.
Of course you need crepes.

41:09.546 --> 41:14.450
I'm okay, walter.

41:14.518 --> 41:17.253
Whenever your mother
made them,

41:17.320 --> 41:20.422
You called them "creeps."

41:20.490 --> 41:25.027
Drove her batty.

41:29.866 --> 41:33.602
She was a strong woman,
your mother.

41:51.588 --> 41:53.056
"william, I don't know
if you've been

41:53.124 --> 41:54.891
"receiving these messages,

41:54.959 --> 41:57.260
"but I continue to hope.

41:58.128 --> 41:59.929
"I wanted to update you
on the status

41:59.996 --> 42:03.766
"of the
penrose-carson experiments.

42:03.834 --> 42:07.136
"one of the tylers did,
in fact, display

42:07.204 --> 42:11.273
"a rather dramatic ability
for mind control.

42:11.341 --> 42:13.075
"but before we became aware
of his ability,

42:13.143 --> 42:18.180
"there were some
unintended consequences.

42:18.248 --> 42:20.683
"among them, he was able
to locate records

42:20.750 --> 42:22.918
"of his surrogate mother,
and, unfortunately,

42:22.986 --> 42:26.755
"made a misguided attempt
to reunite with her.

42:30.827 --> 42:32.995
"in light of this,
I am suspending the experiments

42:33.063 --> 42:35.664
"indefinitely.

42:38.702 --> 42:41.403
"you were right--
mind control is possible,

42:41.471 --> 42:45.741
"given the right conditions.

42:45.809 --> 42:48.010
"so despite
the unfortunate circumstances,

42:48.078 --> 42:51.780
"we can consider the project
a success.

42:51.848 --> 42:56.252
"as always, I hope
this finds you in good health.

42:56.319 --> 43:00.289
Warmest regards, nina."
