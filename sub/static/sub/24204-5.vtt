00:04.250 --> 00:06.036
Previously on Siren...

00:06.040 --> 00:07.280
This will end
very badly.

00:07.290 --> 00:09.167
You need
to find her sister.

00:09.170 --> 00:09.989
[man] Close the glass!

00:13.540 --> 00:15.451
Come on, let's get
out of here, okay?

00:17.290 --> 00:20.327
This part tells us
where you are.

00:20.330 --> 00:21.319
I come back.

00:21.330 --> 00:22.740
Donna, huh?

00:22.750 --> 00:24.069
Hey, are you all right?

00:24.080 --> 00:26.036
I think you might be
in shock.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.075
[Chris, on phone]
Hey, it's me.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.536
Chris?!

00:28.540 --> 00:29.609
Chris, you're alive?!

00:29.620 --> 00:30.609
[Xander] Chris!

00:30.620 --> 00:32.247
He needs help, man.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.740
[shrieks]

00:33.750 --> 00:35.490
[Maddie]
She found her sister.

00:37.290 --> 00:40.327
Home. We lost her.

00:40.330 --> 00:41.877
[Xander] That's the place
where they held Chris.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.075
They're wiping out
all of the evidence.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.069
They'll be coming for him.

00:54.620 --> 00:59.239
[rock music playing]

00:59.250 --> 01:00.615
They taste better cold.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.030
On the house.

01:04.380 --> 01:06.166
Thanks.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.284
[ominous music playing]

01:22.420 --> 01:25.116
[Decker] You're
a hard man to track down.

01:27.710 --> 01:30.452
Glad to see you
looking so healthy.

01:35.380 --> 01:36.574
You remember me?

01:38.670 --> 01:41.241
I saw you at that...
place.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.497
What do you want?

01:45.500 --> 01:48.321
We found that nurse's car
out by Libbey Beach.

01:48.330 --> 01:51.163
When we didn't find you,
we were concerned,

01:51.170 --> 01:54.788
because the woman
you left With,
that nurse, she's...

01:54.790 --> 01:56.917
A nut job?

01:56.920 --> 01:58.160
Unstable.

02:01.290 --> 02:03.576
She's killed several people.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.076
Oh, yeah?

02:07.080 --> 02:09.787
She is extremely violent.

02:09.790 --> 02:12.247
Now, do you know
where she is?

02:12.250 --> 02:14.241
No.

02:14.250 --> 02:18.038
She bolted
as soon as we got
to the beach, okay?

02:18.040 --> 02:20.326
I haven't seen her since.

02:20.330 --> 02:23.072
Glad to hear it.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.206
Yeah.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.201
But if you don't mind,

02:26.210 --> 02:28.246
I want you to tell me

02:28.250 --> 02:30.491
everything
you know about her.

02:32.460 --> 02:36.328
[song in bar]
Let the wall break down

02:37.460 --> 02:40.202
[placid high-pitched calls]

02:51.750 --> 02:53.377
Hey.

02:53.380 --> 02:55.075
You want to tell me
where you've been?

02:55.080 --> 02:58.459
Hey. Uh, I took the boat out
early this morning.

02:58.460 --> 03:00.371
Really? 'Cause I was here
super early,

03:00.380 --> 03:02.200
and there was no boat
and no you.

03:02.210 --> 03:03.871
Okay. Last night.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.701
Female Dragon Fish.

03:07.670 --> 03:09.240
Deep sea species, right?

03:09.250 --> 03:11.115
Lives 2,000 feet down,

03:11.120 --> 03:13.827
so how'd it wind up
floating dead at the surface?

03:13.830 --> 03:16.242
It must have died
near the top.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.706
Where'd you find it?

03:17.710 --> 03:19.530
Out past the Northern Break.

03:19.540 --> 03:20.871
Let me guess.
At the coordinates

03:20.880 --> 03:22.416
where Ryn's tracker dropped out?

03:22.420 --> 03:23.739
Yeah, you know the place.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.320
We've been there
a thousand times.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.706
Yeah, but not alone

03:26.710 --> 03:28.746
and not in the middle
of the night.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.411
It's kind of extreme, dude.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.285
Kind of stupid.

03:32.290 --> 03:35.282
I just want to know if things
are okay where she is.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.326
It's been a month.

03:37.330 --> 03:38.490
She could be anywhere
by now.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.456
Plus, I--

03:42.790 --> 03:44.667
What?

03:44.670 --> 03:47.412
I miss you.

03:47.420 --> 03:49.706
We had this huge thing
happen to us,

03:49.710 --> 03:51.450
and I feel like
we should be closer,

03:54.960 --> 03:57.531
I am, all right?
I'm right here.

03:57.540 --> 03:59.610
Are you?

03:59.620 --> 04:03.112
Yes, I am.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.701
I'm here.

04:09.210 --> 04:11.110
Well, darlin',
I'll send in these labs,

04:11.120 --> 04:12.530
and we should get
a yea or nay

04:12.540 --> 04:14.531
on that medical trial
in the next day or so.

04:14.540 --> 04:15.916
Fingers crossed?

04:19.380 --> 04:22.918
By the by,
I, uh, ran into Ben.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.286
Then you've seen him
more than I have
in the last month.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.326
How did he look?

04:27.330 --> 04:30.117
Whole thing seemed a bit off
to tell you the truth.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.530
Kelly Osterman's
water broke,

04:31.540 --> 04:33.201
so I ended up heading out
to go see them

04:33.210 --> 04:34.575
on-board
their four sleeper.

04:34.580 --> 04:35.990
On the way back in,

04:36.000 --> 04:37.570
I passed Ben heading
out in his trawler.

04:37.580 --> 04:39.787
What was off about that?

04:39.790 --> 04:41.826
Well, it was 3 AM.

04:41.830 --> 04:43.411
Oh.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.536
Was he alone?

04:45.540 --> 04:47.167
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was.

04:47.170 --> 04:49.741
He wasn't with, you know,
Dale Bishop's girl?

04:49.750 --> 04:51.706
No, Maddie wasn't there.

04:51.710 --> 04:53.575
Thought maybe they were
on the outs actually.

04:53.580 --> 04:55.662
Not that I'm aware of.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.376
What would make you
think that?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.746
About a month ago,
Ben called me twice

04:59.750 --> 05:01.286
to check on
this damsel in distress

05:01.290 --> 05:03.076
he picked up
by the side of the road.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.877
The girl was never there
when I showed up,

05:04.880 --> 05:07.166
either time.

05:07.170 --> 05:10.071
And the second time,
Ben was out cold
on the docks.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.036
I don't know.
Seems to me

05:12.040 --> 05:14.611
the kind of thing
people might break up over.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.492
That's just my boy.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.458
He's always on a mission
to save some...

05:22.460 --> 05:23.870
sad thing.

05:25.170 --> 05:26.410
Aanays,
thank you for that.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.570
Please don't tell him
that I...

05:28.580 --> 05:30.878
Winston, why would I
rat you out?

05:30.880 --> 05:33.667
You're how I know
what my son's up to.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.416
How about we go out,

05:43.420 --> 05:45.160
you know,
like regular people,

05:45.170 --> 05:46.614
take you to dinner?

05:46.620 --> 05:49.532
We can get drunk,
have clumsy sex.

05:49.540 --> 05:51.451
Like regular people?

05:51.460 --> 05:53.166
Yeah,
regular clumsy people.

05:53.170 --> 05:54.205
Mm-hmm.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.372
Yo, guys! Oh!

05:58.380 --> 06:00.666
Okay, whoa.
It's cool. Sorry.

06:00.670 --> 06:03.036
Keep goin' with that.

06:03.040 --> 06:08.535
Oh. There was a nasty accident
on the fishing lanes.

06:08.540 --> 06:10.076
It was a local boat.

06:18.380 --> 06:20.666
Guy's luclq the line
didn't slice off his arm.

06:20.670 --> 06:22.456
How'd it happen?

06:22.460 --> 06:24.371
Oh, last month,‘
we've been fishin'
our asses off,

06:24.380 --> 06:26.610
crews are tired,
guys are gettin' hurt.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.781
The money's great,
but we can't keep this up.

06:28.790 --> 06:30.030
Somebody's gonna die.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.826
You gotta slow down, man.

06:31.830 --> 06:34.617
I mean,
what about the fishing
and game regulations?

06:34.620 --> 06:35.666
Quotas?

06:35.670 --> 06:37.069
I don't know about that,

06:37.080 --> 06:38.570
but right now, they got us
pullin' everything.

06:38.580 --> 06:40.491
Young, old, sick, weird.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.070
NO one seems to care.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.708
I care. You care.

06:44.710 --> 06:46.575
And I know you guys
are just trying
to make a living,

06:46.580 --> 06:48.662
but people
are getting hurt, Xan.

06:48.670 --> 06:50.490
It's not worth it.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.491
-Let's do something
about it.
-[srren]

06:54.500 --> 06:58.288
All right.
All right, I'm done.

06:58.290 --> 07:00.497
All right, find out
what you can from your dad

07:00.500 --> 07:02.707
and the guys on the lanes
and see who's
allowing all this.

07:02.710 --> 07:04.746
I'll figure out what's
happening on the fishery side,

07:04.750 --> 07:06.877
what we're doing
with all this junk fish.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.496
Hey, uh, you mind
if we take this?

07:09.500 --> 07:10.910
Yeah, sure.
It's not good eatin',

07:10.920 --> 07:12.569
but, um,
yeah, have at it.

07:12.580 --> 07:13.911
-Have fun.
-Thanks.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.202
[phone ringing]

07:18.210 --> 07:20.326
[Roberta]
Pownall Seafood.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.826
They told me you were here.

07:23.830 --> 07:25.036
Thanks, Bertie.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.246
Thought I was dreaming.

07:26.250 --> 07:27.535
Ha ha.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.326
Been a little while,
hasn't it?

07:29.330 --> 07:30.786
Yeah, I'm sorry.

07:30.790 --> 07:32.997
Uh, it's been busy
at the Center.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.412
I'd like to think
you're here to say hi
to your own dad,

07:35.420 --> 07:37.911
but I think I know
better than that
by now, don't I?

07:37.920 --> 07:39.740
What's up, kiddo?

07:39.750 --> 07:42.958
Doug told me you were
thinking about bringing me on,

07:42.960 --> 07:44.530
environmental consultant?

07:44.540 --> 07:46.280
I didn't know
he said anything.

07:46.290 --> 07:48.417
Listen, I know
it's not your bag,

07:48.420 --> 07:50.786
but just, before
you make a decision,
just hear me out.

07:50.790 --> 07:51.779
Let's do it.

07:51.790 --> 07:53.746
Really?

07:53.750 --> 07:55.206
You serious? _
You're _not screwm'
With me?

07:55.210 --> 07:57.576
No, I'm in.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.491
Uh... [chuckles]

08:00.620 --> 08:02.781
You don't know.
This is, uh...

08:02.790 --> 08:04.030
This is a big deal to me.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.032
I want to help you
find a better way to fish.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.782
Maybe even make you guys
some more money.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.996
I think we're fishing
just fine,

08:11.000 --> 08:12.490
but if you think
you've got a way

08:12.500 --> 08:14.411
to make me more money,
I'm all ears.

08:14.420 --> 08:16.285
All right,
why don't you come by
tomorrow morning?

08:16.290 --> 08:17.700
See how we do things,

08:17.710 --> 08:19.416
and then we can talk.

08:19.420 --> 08:23.459
And, uh, in the meantime,

08:23.460 --> 08:24.495
uh...

08:26.960 --> 08:28.279
welcome aboard, son.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.202
[door opens and closes]

08:43.670 --> 08:44.659
Hey.

08:44.670 --> 08:45.955
Hey.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.666
How'd it go
with your dad?

08:47.670 --> 08:49.956
Uh, he was real excited
to have me on board.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.279
Ahem...

08:51.290 --> 08:53.201
which kind of sucked,
actually.

08:53.210 --> 08:54.666
Of course it did.

08:54.670 --> 08:56.615
I told you it would.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.453
[Ben] Yeah, I hate
not telling him the truth.

08:59.460 --> 09:00.609
What'd you find out here?

09:00.620 --> 09:03.783
Absence of enzymes
in the digestive tract.

09:03.790 --> 09:04.745
Irregular ammonia levels.

09:04.750 --> 09:06.706
Death by starvation.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.917
[Jerry]
What's up, party people?

09:10.580 --> 09:11.956
-I got dinner.
-Thanks, Jerry.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.666
-[Ben] Thanks.
-Bone app-o—titty.

09:15.830 --> 09:17.491
Sushi? Really, Jer?

09:17.500 --> 09:18.910
Dealer's choice.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.456
I'm outta here. Tchk!

09:22.500 --> 09:23.569
[door closes]

09:23.580 --> 09:25.707
All right.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.491
You know this isn't
what I was thinking

09:30.500 --> 09:33.742
when I said, uh,
"Let's have dinner
like regular people"?

09:33.750 --> 09:35.570
No?

09:35.580 --> 09:36.956
Not exactly.

09:36.960 --> 09:41.249
All right.
How about we skip dinner

09:41.250 --> 09:43.536
and just get straight
to the clumsy sex part?

09:45.790 --> 09:48.111
Works for me.

09:53.790 --> 09:55.667
Yeah, I remember you.

09:55.670 --> 09:56.705
Mm-hmm.

09:58.540 --> 10:00.326
[beeping]

10:01.670 --> 10:03.490
[beeping]

10:03.500 --> 10:04.910
Hey.

10:04.920 --> 10:08.117
[beeping]

10:08.120 --> 10:09.667
It's her tracker.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.826
[Ben]
She's coming back.

10:16.830 --> 10:18.570
She's coming back.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.957
[tracker beeping]

10:27.710 --> 10:29.996
[tracker beeping]

10:35.880 --> 10:37.279
Ben, over here.

10:42.830 --> 10:44.491
[Ben]
Maddie? Look at this.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.035
Think it's her sister?

10:51.120 --> 10:52.280
[Ben] Maybe.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.871
Says she's off the beach.
She's in the woods.

10:55.880 --> 10:56.995
We're just
a little bit behind.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.615
You go.
I'll collect a sample.

10:58.620 --> 11:00.497
[Ben] Okay.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.458
[tracker beeping]

11:09.790 --> 11:11.280
Yes, sir, as far
as he's concerned,

11:11.290 --> 11:13.531
she's just
a deranged nurse.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.610
So the fisherman's no longer
a threat to the project?

11:15.620 --> 11:17.417
[Decker]
If anything, he helped.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.957
He confirmed that she
disappeared at Libbey Beach.

11:19.960 --> 11:23.202
So we mapped
a logical trajectory
off the coast.

11:23.210 --> 11:26.828
We were able to isolate
sound patterns
100 miles offshore.

11:26.830 --> 11:29.537
They match recordings
from our specimen
in Bremerton.

11:29.540 --> 11:30.529
[Harrison]
And you heard it?

11:30.540 --> 11:31.996
She's out there?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.070
[Decker] Or others
very much like her.

11:36.330 --> 11:37.991
Better hope you found her.

11:48.210 --> 11:50.371
[panﬁng]

12:11.040 --> 12:12.371
Stop!

12:14.170 --> 12:16.377
You follow.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.701
Water.

12:18.710 --> 12:20.780
[Donna]
You come back.

12:20.790 --> 12:22.701
You know their words.

12:22.710 --> 12:24.701
[Ryn] We need help...

12:24.710 --> 12:27.873
from the people.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.279
No!

12:29.290 --> 12:30.871
I know people hurt you.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.610
But some are good.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.746
Will help us.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.246
Come.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.780
Put it on.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.996
No!

13:18.460 --> 13:21.111
Wa... ter.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.611
I will stay.

13:23.620 --> 13:25.030
You go.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.489
[hisses]

13:33.500 --> 13:35.570
[tracker beeping]

13:41.960 --> 13:44.326
We need the people.

13:50.210 --> 13:51.325
Now.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.240
[knock on door]

13:58.250 --> 13:59.319
Come in.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.496
[Nina] I've got
the latest rendering.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.169
The engineer designed it
to your specifications, sir.

14:07.170 --> 14:08.706
As requested,
the system allows you to

14:08.710 --> 14:10.996
introduce a sedative
into the water.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.706
[beeping]

14:12.710 --> 14:15.918
One touch will fully
immobilize a specimen.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.741
She told me to assure you

14:18.750 --> 14:20.411
there is no chance
of repeating Bremerton.

14:22.330 --> 14:23.957
Thank you, Nina.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.744
[Siren song echoing]

14:40.500 --> 14:42.070
Any sign of them?

14:42.080 --> 14:43.786
Just this.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.951
Ryn's tracker.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.162
[phone line ringing]

15:02.170 --> 15:04.206
[Helen]
Helen's Antiquities.

15:04.210 --> 15:06.030
Ryn's back.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.417
Why on earth
would she come back?

15:08.420 --> 15:11.071
-We don't know.
-Well, you know
if she shows up here,

15:11.080 --> 15:13.412
I'll send her
right back to the water.

15:13.420 --> 15:14.910
Where are you?

15:14.920 --> 15:16.285
We're on our way
to the Research Center.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.450
Look, if you see her just--

15:17.460 --> 15:18.779
Okay, I'm lockin' up.

15:18.790 --> 15:20.530
I'll see you there.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.115
I didn't really think
she'd go there.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.532
I thought for sure
she'd be at the houseboat.

15:26.540 --> 15:27.666
Me, too.

15:27.670 --> 15:30.161
[phone ringing]

15:32.170 --> 15:33.569
It's your mom.

15:33.580 --> 15:35.070
Hell, no.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.377
I can't.

15:36.380 --> 15:37.449
Worst timing ever.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.075
Yeah.

15:39.080 --> 15:42.072
[phone ringing]

15:42.080 --> 15:44.241
Hello?

15:44.250 --> 15:46.616
Hello, dear.
Elaine Pownall.

15:46.620 --> 15:49.612
Oh. Hi.

15:49.620 --> 15:50.700
[whispering]
It's your mother.

15:50.710 --> 15:52.166
I'm not here.

15:52.170 --> 15:53.660
What a surprise.

15:53.670 --> 15:56.241
It's, uh... It's nice
to hear from you.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.740
[Elaine]
Thank you, dear.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.241
Listen, I was thinking
that maybe it's time

16:00.250 --> 16:02.070
you and I got to know
each other.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.877
I'd like to take you
to lunch.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.417
Wow. Lunch.

16:06.420 --> 16:09.071
Um, that's so nice of you.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.241
How's tomorrow?
Captain's Reef, 1:30?

16:11.250 --> 16:12.319
Does that work for you?

16:12.330 --> 16:14.036
Um, yes. Thanks.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.031
[Elaine]
I'll see you then. Goodbye.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.201
Okay, bye.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.781
So you're going
to lunch with her?

16:20.790 --> 16:22.917
I guess I am.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.115
Wow. Okay.

16:26.420 --> 16:30.322
Fun... for you.

16:30.330 --> 16:32.070
We've barely ever spoken
a word to each other.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.240
She has to stop
and think of my name

16:33.250 --> 16:35.206
every time she sees me.

16:35.210 --> 16:37.075
My advice, cocktails.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.820
Large ones.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.320
[phone ringing]

16:46.080 --> 16:48.662
[Clarence]
All right.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.241
Trespassing call,
north side near the high school.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.115
Couple of randos are running
through baclqards.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.532
You don't need to drive
out there, Clarence.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.280
We're shorthanded.
The sheriff's out of town.
Just log it.

16:57.290 --> 16:59.417
[Clarence] No,
lady seemed pretty upset.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.661
Said her kid saw
a couple of females
running around,

17:01.670 --> 17:03.456
and one of them
was Porky Piggin' it.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.166
Porlq Piggin' it?

17:05.170 --> 17:06.819
Yeah, shirt, no pants.

17:06.830 --> 17:09.116
That is a lewd
and lascivious, Officer.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.702
Seriously, nothin'
but a Whalers jersey on.

17:11.710 --> 17:15.168
That sounds more like
a bachelorette
party gone south.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.246
Safe.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.877
We wait.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.871
[door opens]

17:42.120 --> 17:43.166
Ryn.

17:48.210 --> 17:49.245
Ryn.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.785
This Ben.

17:52.790 --> 17:55.327
Maddie.

17:55.330 --> 17:56.615
Good people.

17:58.580 --> 17:59.786
This is your sister?

17:59.790 --> 18:01.530
Yes.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.609
Hello.

18:02.620 --> 18:03.951
Donna.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.996
Donna?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.206
That's your name?

18:08.830 --> 18:10.616
We need help.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.781
Ben? Maddie?

18:12.790 --> 18:14.417
Oh, you found her.

18:16.290 --> 18:17.279
Hello, Ryn.

18:17.290 --> 18:18.530
-No,no!
-Oh, my God.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.200
The other one.

18:21.210 --> 18:22.825
Ryn came back
with her sister.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.286
[Helen]
Yeah, I can see that.

18:24.290 --> 18:25.496
But why?

18:25.500 --> 18:27.036
Why did you
come back, Ryn?

18:27.040 --> 18:28.416
We need food.

18:28.420 --> 18:30.411
It's getting worse,
isn't it?

18:30.420 --> 18:33.412
Now nothing to hunt.

18:33.420 --> 18:34.910
To eat.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.820
Sister, me.

18:36.830 --> 18:39.663
All dying.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.786
Oh.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.870
Food!

18:45.880 --> 18:47.416
Them...

18:47.420 --> 18:48.409
take!

18:48.420 --> 18:49.569
No, no, no, no.

18:49.580 --> 18:50.877
We-- We didn't kill it.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.166
We were--_ _
We were studying It.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.376
Fnends.

18:56.380 --> 18:58.166
[Maddie] Look, we want
to help you.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.206
-[screaming]
-Whoa!

19:03.210 --> 19:04.495
Hey, calm down!

19:04.500 --> 19:06.240
-[hissing]
-Whoa!

19:06.250 --> 19:07.285
[hisses]

19:09.210 --> 19:12.202
[both screaming]

19:20.460 --> 19:21.495
Hey!

19:25.250 --> 19:27.241
Ryn! Water!

19:27.250 --> 19:28.660
Now!

19:28.670 --> 19:30.285
No.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.376
[panﬁng]

19:51.330 --> 19:54.959
My sister not bad.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.746
It's her instinct.

19:56.750 --> 19:57.819
That's all.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.036
She was confused.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.372
Yeah, of course,
she was confused.

20:01.380 --> 20:05.032
She sided with you
instead of her own sister.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.702
Have you two ever fought
like that before?

20:07.710 --> 20:09.029
No.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.918
Yeah, she felt betrayed.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.535
It's unnatural.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.076
They don't belong here.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.457
You're only here
because those fishermen

20:17.460 --> 20:19.496
stole your sister
from the water.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.116
And God knows what
the military did to her.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.872
Sister was hurt.

20:23.880 --> 20:27.281
A man took her blood,

20:27.290 --> 20:28.666
her skin.

20:28.670 --> 20:29.989
I'm sorry.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.491
For her, people are bad.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.286
No trust.

20:34.290 --> 20:35.917
[Ben] There are
a lot of bad people.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.457
Maybe even my own family.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.870
Ben, we don't know
if that's true.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.324
We do know that.
Xander said it.

20:43.330 --> 20:44.615
They're out fishing
night and day,

20:44.620 --> 20:46.076
catching everything.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.411
And the dead marine life?

20:47.420 --> 20:50.992
It's no accident.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.820
We are gonna figure it out.

20:52.830 --> 20:54.536
We're gonna stop it.

20:54.540 --> 20:56.781
What about the sister?

20:56.790 --> 20:59.327
Sh_e's out there
roaming the streets.

20:59.330 --> 21:02.208
Do you think your sister
went back to the ocean?

21:02.210 --> 21:03.996
No.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.538
Will not go without me.

21:07.540 --> 21:10.498
Blood will bring shark.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.536
She need place to...

21:12.540 --> 21:14.371
-To heal?
-Yes.

21:14.380 --> 21:17.031
But will come for me.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.247
I'm thinking it'd be
a whole lot safer
at the houseboat.

21:19.250 --> 21:20.410
Yeah, for sure.

21:20.420 --> 21:21.956
Somewhere with a door.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.872
[man] Every single time,
right?

21:27.880 --> 21:29.108
[laughing]

21:32.120 --> 21:35.533
-Ooh! Hey, Listen...
-[man 2] Look at that.

21:35.540 --> 21:36.495
Go Whalers!

21:36.500 --> 21:37.956
-[hisses]
-Whoa!

21:37.960 --> 21:40.372
[men laughing]

21:40.380 --> 21:42.166
Yeah, girl.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.371
[ominous music playing]

21:55.580 --> 21:57.377
[sniffing]

22:03.750 --> 22:05.160
[hisses]

22:13.960 --> 22:16.201
Hey! What are you
doin' in here?!

22:16.210 --> 22:17.416
Get away from there!

22:18.420 --> 22:20.069
Stupid meth heads.

22:23.830 --> 22:25.161
You can't do that!

22:27.960 --> 22:29.450
[hisses]

22:30.620 --> 22:32.167
[hisses]

22:32.170 --> 22:34.616
Holy jeez!

22:34.620 --> 22:36.372
[growling shriek]

22:40.170 --> 22:41.489
[Wally screams and grunts]

22:43.670 --> 22:44.455
[hisses]

22:46.620 --> 22:48.417
[bell ringing, alarm sounding]

23:02.580 --> 23:04.286
Hey, Dad.

23:04.290 --> 23:05.325
Thanks.

23:05.330 --> 23:06.615
What happened?

23:06.620 --> 23:08.201
Hey. Yeah,
thank you very much.

23:08.210 --> 23:10.075
Okay, listen to this.
Some, half-naked girl

23:10.080 --> 23:11.786
tried to eat the catch
right out of the bins.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.452
Then she beat the hell
out of Wally Merton.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.700
-Big Wally?
-Yeah?

23:15.710 --> 23:17.575
Why?

23:17.580 --> 23:20.743
I have no idea. I guess
he was trying to stop her.

23:20.750 --> 23:22.456
That's a new one.

23:26.670 --> 23:28.535
So, where do you
want to start?

23:28.540 --> 23:31.327
I was thinking I'd take
the day to get up to speed.

23:31.330 --> 23:32.490
Check out
the different departments,

23:32.500 --> 23:33.956
see how you're
doing things these days.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.496
That sounds good.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.411
-[phone beeps]
-Schoenville Markets.

23:37.420 --> 23:39.661
I got a big lunch meeting
with these guys today.

23:39.670 --> 23:41.410
All right, do your thing.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.705
Okay.
We'll see you later.

23:42.710 --> 23:44.246
Yeah.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.707
You tryin' to sneak
Cap'n Crunch
into my galley?

23:59.710 --> 24:01.701
What are you,
like, six?

24:01.710 --> 24:04.668
It's not mine, bitch.

24:04.670 --> 24:06.661
Hey, it's got ten essential
vitamins and minerals in it.

24:06.670 --> 24:08.706
[Chris]
It's my Cap'n Crunch.

24:08.710 --> 24:11.110
You mean you slobs haven't
cleaned out the pantry

24:11.120 --> 24:12.747
since I've been gone?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.206
-Chris!
-Hey, man.

24:14.210 --> 24:15.916
-Dude!
-You good?

24:15.920 --> 24:17.205
[laughing] Oh, man!

24:17.210 --> 24:19.075
Hey, buddy.
You good?

24:19.080 --> 24:20.911
What the hell are you
doing here, man?

24:20.920 --> 24:22.660
Well, you know,

24:22.670 --> 24:24.911
I missed the stink of chopped
squid and cod's blood.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.536
Um, I don't know
about this, man.

24:27.540 --> 24:28.700
They're gonna find
you here, dude.

24:28.710 --> 24:30.371
They already have.

24:30.380 --> 24:33.417
This guy from the facility
tracked me down.

24:33.420 --> 24:34.705
Wait, all the way
to Alaska?

24:34.710 --> 24:36.496
Yeah, I know. Crazy.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.570
But, apparently,
all he wanted to know about

24:38.580 --> 24:41.788
was the nurse that I drove
to Libbey Beach with.

24:41.790 --> 24:45.169
So 3,000 miles to find out
about a nurse?

24:45.170 --> 24:47.786
Uh, yeah,
she's wanted, dude,

24:47.790 --> 24:49.781
for, like,
multiple homicides.

24:49.790 --> 24:52.372
I was ridin' with
a legit psycho killer.

24:52.380 --> 24:54.496
I'm luclq to be alive.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.661
That and because
that mermaid almost
killed you before that.

24:56.670 --> 24:59.571
Uh, dude says
it wasn't a mermaid.

24:59.580 --> 25:01.536
What exactly did they
take from us?

25:01.540 --> 25:02.529
He tell you that?

25:02.540 --> 25:04.610
Said it was a rare fish.

25:04.620 --> 25:05.609
[laughs]

25:05.620 --> 25:06.951
Okay, yeah, whatever.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.370
Look, man, yeah, maybe...

25:08.380 --> 25:09.870
maybe it is some big cover-up.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.780
Who knows?

25:11.790 --> 25:13.371
But I'm done runnin'.

25:13.380 --> 25:15.200
Look, if they found me
up there,

25:15.210 --> 25:16.700
they're gonna find me
anywhere.

25:16.710 --> 25:18.746
I'd rather be in danger
here with you guys

25:18.750 --> 25:20.911
than all alone

25:20.920 --> 25:22.785
up in Butthole, Alaska.

25:22.790 --> 25:26.669
So this here is
top shelf, my friend.

25:26.670 --> 25:31.698
We can crack it open
if you give me my job back.

25:31.710 --> 25:33.746
-All right.
-Yeah?

25:33.750 --> 25:36.241
[Xander] Yeah. All right.
I mean, I'd rather
have that mermaid,

25:36.250 --> 25:38.070
but I guess we'll have to
settle for your sorry ass.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.616
-It's not a mermaid.
-Yeah, whatever.

25:39.620 --> 25:41.702
-Just shut up and pour.
-All right.

25:43.830 --> 25:45.661
Petty Officer Montero?

25:45.670 --> 25:47.661
Yes, sir?

25:47.670 --> 25:49.160
Just picked up
a report from the local
sheriff's office

25:49.170 --> 25:50.990
at Bristol Cove,
Washington.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.572
Seems a young woman
assaulted a 250-pound
dock worker.

25:54.580 --> 25:56.992
Sir, what would you
like me to do about it, sir?

25:57.000 --> 26:00.379
I need you to get me
a detailed description
of the suspect.

26:09.540 --> 26:11.826
Are you gonna
be okay by yourself?

26:11.830 --> 26:13.491
Okay.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.660
Yes.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.325
Pretty.

26:26.330 --> 26:27.661
This?

26:27.670 --> 26:29.206
I bought it for a wedding.

26:29.210 --> 26:30.666
It's not my thing really.

26:30.670 --> 26:32.706
I'm having lunch
with Ben's mother.

26:32.710 --> 26:34.666
Mother.

26:34.670 --> 26:36.991
What is mother?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.740
Uh... mother.

26:40.460 --> 26:41.529
Well...

26:46.250 --> 26:47.911
Family.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.239
Mother.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.916
You have mother?

26:53.920 --> 26:57.913
Uh, yes, but she's gone.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.035
Dead?

26:59.040 --> 27:00.246
No, I--

27:02.000 --> 27:03.820
I don't know.

27:03.830 --> 27:06.572
Just gone.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.959
Family important.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.747
Yes, family is, uh...

27:16.750 --> 27:18.536
love.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.610
You are love.

27:22.620 --> 27:23.780
Oh.

27:25.750 --> 27:26.876
Thank you.

27:32.330 --> 27:34.571
To stay safe
if you need it.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.162
I miss you.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.780
I missed you, too.

28:03.750 --> 28:04.956
Bye-bye.

28:06.540 --> 28:09.168
Uh, yeah, okay.

28:09.170 --> 28:10.706
Bye.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.450
[door opens]

28:17.000 --> 28:18.376
[door closes]

28:23.960 --> 28:26.167
Let me show you
the line here.

28:26.170 --> 28:28.661
This is from a load
of sockeye we got
this morning.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.037
It seems like a lot
a bycatch mixed up
in the haul.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.076
Yep.
It's a new client.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.958
Coastal Mills
has been buying,
like, anything we got.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.416
Coastal Mills?

28:39.420 --> 28:41.035
I've never hard of 'em.

28:41.040 --> 28:43.747
Nobody has
until about a month ago.

28:43.750 --> 28:45.957
Trucks just started
showing up.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.245
They've been buying
the stuff up

28:47.250 --> 28:50.162
faster than we can
load it in the bins.

28:50.170 --> 28:51.990
[Xander] Yo, Ben!

28:52.000 --> 28:54.070
Got a second?

28:54.080 --> 28:56.822
-Thanks, man.
-Sure.

28:56.830 --> 28:58.457
[Xander] They found him
all the way in Alaska.

28:58.460 --> 29:00.246
-In Alaska, man.
-Crazy.

29:00.250 --> 29:03.162
And this Decker guy
told Chris what?

29:03.170 --> 29:05.070
That the psycho nurse
killed a bunch of people

29:05.080 --> 29:06.160
and he needed to find her.

29:06.170 --> 29:07.876
That doesn't make any sense.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.871
'Cause if she really was
this homicidal maniac,

29:09.880 --> 29:12.496
then the cops would have
been looking for Chris,

29:12.500 --> 29:13.910
not this Decker dude,

29:13.920 --> 29:15.911
some whacko fish doctor.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.115
Right. He's lying.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.530
Something happened
in that place.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.417
They wanted to find out
what Chris knew.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.991
Yeah, only he was
too drugged up
to know anything,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.412
so this Decker guy
just let him be.

29:26.420 --> 29:28.035
What'd you find out here?

29:28.040 --> 29:30.918
You ever heard of a company
called Coastal Mills?

29:30.920 --> 29:32.535
No. Why?

29:32.540 --> 29:34.952
They're the ones buying up
all that junk fish

29:34.960 --> 29:36.245
you guys
have been hauling in.

29:36.250 --> 29:38.491
I'm gonna try and figure out
who they are.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.912
Mmm. So maybe
this Decker's connected.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.990
Well, let me know
what you find out.
I gotta go.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.241
Told the guys that
I would buy some pizza
to sop up the whisky.

29:53.460 --> 29:54.700
[Elaine]
Thank you for coming.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.746
Well, thank you
for inviting me.

29:56.750 --> 29:57.910
Thanks.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.615
You have to try
Crab Louis salad.

29:59.620 --> 30:00.666
It's delicious.

30:00.670 --> 30:03.742
Oh. Thanks.

30:03.750 --> 30:05.661
So how's my boy
been lately?

30:05.670 --> 30:06.876
I never hear
from hIm anymore.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.280
Um...

30:09.290 --> 30:11.747
I know the two of you
are busy with your work
at the Center.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.490
Uh, yeah, we have been.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.707
We have this rescue
that's super demanding.

30:15.710 --> 30:17.450
It's eating up
a lot of Ben's time.

30:17.460 --> 30:18.996
He gets deep in it,
you know?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.456
Oh, I know.

30:20.460 --> 30:24.078
So how are you,
the two of you?

30:24.080 --> 30:25.286
Oh, we're fine.

30:25.290 --> 30:27.531
Great, actually.

30:27.540 --> 30:29.030
Good to hear.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.530
What did you rescue?

30:30.540 --> 30:34.112
Uh, a wounded seal pup.

30:38.620 --> 30:40.201
I know what's going on.

30:41.420 --> 30:42.876
Oh.

30:42.880 --> 30:46.919
I love my son,
but he has issues.

30:46.920 --> 30:50.037
Everybody has issues.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.031
Ben's a brilliant thinker,

30:52.040 --> 30:53.701
but he gets lost
in his own mind,

30:53.710 --> 30:55.701
and he--
he shuts people out,

30:55.710 --> 30:56.995
even his own mother.

30:58.540 --> 31:01.998
He does lose himself
in his work.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.616
All his little
wounded creatures.

31:04.620 --> 31:06.576
He's devoted to them.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.996
Are you
his current rescue?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.036
Excuse me?

31:12.040 --> 31:13.496
Oh, don't take that
the wrong way.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.320
I was his first.

31:23.170 --> 31:24.660
[chattering]

31:24.670 --> 31:26.661
[cackling]

31:26.670 --> 31:28.319
What are you watching?

31:28.330 --> 31:30.662
Oh, um...

31:30.670 --> 31:33.457
something stupid
with a monkey.

31:33.460 --> 31:35.166
What can I do you for,
handsome?

31:35.170 --> 31:36.455
Nothing, actually.

31:36.460 --> 31:39.167
I, uh, brought you
a coffee.

31:39.170 --> 31:41.377
Still like it black
with a little bit of sugar?

31:41.380 --> 31:44.326
Since before
you could carry it.

31:44.330 --> 31:47.618
Hey, I was thinking
about taking my dad
out for lunch.

31:47.620 --> 31:48.826
Oh, isn't that sweet,

31:48.830 --> 31:50.161
but he's already at lunch,

31:50.170 --> 31:53.571
with the buyer
from Schoenville Market?

31:53.580 --> 31:55.912
Mind if I wait here
till he gets back?

31:55.920 --> 31:57.706
-Like you have to ask.
-[phone ringing]

31:57.710 --> 31:59.200
Oh.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.075
Pownall Seafood.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.662
Uh, no, no.
He's not here right now.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.577
[Roberta]
No. Uh, no.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.242
-Thank you. Bye.
-[hangs up]

32:19.500 --> 32:20.660
[unsuccessful login beeps]

32:30.460 --> 32:32.325
[unsuccessful login beeps]

32:32.330 --> 32:33.456
[phone ringing]

32:33.460 --> 32:35.576
Oh. What is it?

32:35.580 --> 32:37.536
Pownall Seafood.

32:48.330 --> 32:51.163
[Roberta]
Yes, well, uh, Tuesday.

32:51.170 --> 32:54.617
Tuesday would be wonderful.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.450
Yes, yes.

33:26.620 --> 33:28.611
He was consumed
wrth ﬁnding a cure

33:28.620 --> 33:32.078
or some miracle treatment
to get me back on my feet.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.741
He hated seeing you suffer.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.911
That's sort of what drives him.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.990
Yes. Thank you.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.992
He spent an entire year
online after my accident

33:41.000 --> 33:43.161
researching
spinal cord regeneration

33:43.170 --> 33:46.287
and calling clinics
around the world.

33:46.290 --> 33:47.416
He didn't sleep.

33:47.420 --> 33:49.661
Yeah.

33:49.670 --> 33:52.412
Not sleeping is a thing
with him sometimes.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.456
He fixates.

33:54.460 --> 33:57.452
While he's rescuing you,
you're-- you're everything.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.281
I'm sure he helped you
get over your mother

34:01.290 --> 34:03.702
when you were
first together.

34:03.710 --> 34:06.247
But soon enough,
another wounded creature
comes along,

34:06.250 --> 34:08.571
and he dives
right in after her.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.108
[phone vibrating
and chiming]

34:12.120 --> 34:14.076
Do you need
to get that, dear?

34:18.120 --> 34:20.497
Sorry. I-- I kinda do.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.377
Another drink,
Ms. Pownall?

34:22.380 --> 34:25.247
Um, actually, Andrea,
I'll have the ros
that I love.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.616
Thank you. Maddie?
Would you like something?

34:29.620 --> 34:31.747
Well, if it's Ben, please
tell him I said hello.

34:31.750 --> 34:36.119
Um, I'm so sorry,
but I-- I have to go.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.326
It's, uh...

34:38.960 --> 34:41.167
A new rescue?

34:41.170 --> 34:43.320
It's the same rescue,
actually,

34:43.330 --> 34:45.378
because your son
doesn't give up on things.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.530
And by the way,

34:47.540 --> 34:49.167
I'm not a rescue.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.786
Okay.

34:51.790 --> 34:52.916
Well, thank you
for coming.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.706
Thanks for the salad.

35:01.710 --> 35:06.249
Um, actually, Andrea,
could you make that ros
a martini, please?

35:10.830 --> 35:12.377
So this company,
Coastal Mills,

35:12.380 --> 35:13.824
reached out to my dad,

35:13.830 --> 35:15.070
offered to buy up
all the bycatch

35:15.080 --> 35:16.206
Pownall could deliver.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.371
And-- and who runs
Coastal Mills?

35:18.380 --> 35:20.200
No one knows. _
They don't eXIst online.

35:20.210 --> 35:22.747
No one at Pownall's
ever heard of them.

35:22.750 --> 35:25.878
There's no record
of what happens to the stuff
after they take it.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.201
It's like the trucks
just leave the fisheries

35:28.210 --> 35:30.826
and then disappear.

35:30.830 --> 35:33.879
And Xander said
the Department of Fish and Game

35:33.880 --> 35:35.950
stopped grounding
and fining boats

35:35.960 --> 35:37.780
for overfishing a month ago

35:37.790 --> 35:39.451
right around the same time.

35:39.460 --> 35:42.452
So the government's
letting it happen.

35:44.210 --> 35:46.110
They're making it happen.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.247
[Ben]
They're staving them out

35:50.250 --> 35:52.571
so they can catch
more of them.

36:43.710 --> 36:45.029
There you are.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.371
[hissing]

36:46.380 --> 36:47.699
I've been looking
all over for you.

36:47.710 --> 36:49.610
[hissing]

36:49.620 --> 36:52.953
I thought you might be
by the water.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.110
It's okay.

36:55.120 --> 36:57.611
I'm a friend.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.417
Thought
you might be hungry.

37:13.830 --> 37:15.161
It's okay.

37:15.170 --> 37:16.956
We want the same thing.

37:38.330 --> 37:42.289
Want to go back
to the water?

37:42.290 --> 37:43.780
But not without your sister?

37:47.330 --> 37:48.877
I can help.

37:53.580 --> 37:54.410
You?

37:56.710 --> 37:57.779
Yes.

37:59.330 --> 38:00.456
You can trust me, because...

38:04.420 --> 38:05.956
I am one of you.

38:05.960 --> 38:09.327
[music playing]

38:14.960 --> 38:17.872
They want to hurt us?

38:17.880 --> 38:20.872
They want to catch you.

38:23.750 --> 38:26.287
Danger to go home.

38:27.670 --> 38:28.819
Yes.

38:28.830 --> 38:30.616
[exhales]

38:33.080 --> 38:35.378
Not safe on land.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.530
Not safe in water.

38:39.170 --> 38:41.616
Nowhere is safe.

38:41.620 --> 38:44.418
We're gonna change that.

38:44.420 --> 38:47.787
We'll make it safe
for you

38:47.790 --> 38:49.610
to be wherever
you want to be.

38:51.380 --> 38:53.450
How?

38:55.830 --> 39:00.745
No, screw that, man, okay?

39:00.750 --> 39:04.618
None of this would have
ever happened if that...

39:04.620 --> 39:06.872
that freak fish hadn't
messed me up, you know?

39:06.880 --> 39:09.610
Did you ever ask
this Decker jerk

39:09.620 --> 39:11.827
what they did with the fish?

39:11.830 --> 39:14.458
They're studying it
or something.

39:14.460 --> 39:16.075
Who knows?

39:16.080 --> 39:20.449
Stop asking me
about it, okay?

39:20.460 --> 39:22.451
It's good to be home.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.496
Good to be home.

39:34.710 --> 39:36.371
[line ringing]

39:36.380 --> 39:38.371
Hey, it's Ben.
Leave me a message.

39:38.380 --> 39:39.449
[beeps]

39:39.460 --> 39:42.668
Yo, Ben, dude, um...

39:42.670 --> 39:44.410
I'm just checkin' in,

39:44.420 --> 39:46.536
and wonderin'
what you found out,

39:46.540 --> 39:50.453
'cause, uh...
'cause this Decker guy,

39:50.460 --> 39:54.499
I'm thinkin' he's the one.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.491
That he's behind it all.

39:58.040 --> 40:02.579
[dramatic music playing]

40:02.580 --> 40:05.458
[Xander] Ben, he ain't gonna
stop until he gets her back.

40:23.710 --> 40:26.247
[placid high-pitched calls]

40:30.670 --> 40:35.619
[woman singing Siren song]
