Sir. We've got
Colonel Carter.
On screen .

43:37.573 --> 43:40.700
General, we barely got away.
The planet was destroyed.

43:41.076 --> 43:43.161
We managed to beam
most of our people
off the surface

43:43.245 --> 43:44.829
before jumping
to hyperspace.

43:45.080 --> 43:48.082
We also believe that
the enemy forces
were destroyed.

43:48.709 --> 43:51.502
Any word on how
they gained intel
on our base?

43:51.587 --> 43:52.712
No.

43:52.796 --> 43:54.297
What about casualties?

43:54.381 --> 43:57.300
Twelve. Eighty-plus MlA.

43:57.384 --> 43:58.718
The bunker-shielding
technology

43:58.802 --> 44:01.888
prevented us
from beaming out
anyone inside.

44:01.972 --> 44:03.723
How many people made it
through the gate to Earth?

44:04.183 --> 44:05.224
None.

44:05.309 --> 44:08.686
None? Our sensors
indicated that the
stargate was active

44:08.771 --> 44:11.063
for a full six minutes
before the core went
critical.

44:11.148 --> 44:12.982
Well , they didn't
come through here.

how long the air

the life support fixed?

44:47.476 --> 44:50.478
No, sir. Dr. Rush and
the other scientists
are working on that.

44:50.562 --> 44:53.523

Lieutenant. l need answers.

Okay, listen up !

Everybody who is able,
we are going to search
this ship top to bottom .

45:03.158 --> 45:04.575
Teams of three.

45:06.245 --> 45:07.245
Weapons?

45:07.329 --> 45:09.914
Twenty-three,
including handguns.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.166
One per group?

45:12.251 --> 45:13.376
Yeah .

45:13.961 --> 45:17.588
Flashlights, radios,
only when necessary.

45:17.673 --> 45:20.383
Once those batteries
are dead ,
they are dead .

45:20.467 --> 45:23.219
Regular check-ins with
Dr. Rush in the control room

45:23.303 --> 45:26.722
every 1 0 minutes,
and keep in mind ,
as far as we know,

45:26.807 --> 45:28.432
this bucket is
really freaking old ,

45:28.517 --> 45:30.101
and there may be
areas of damage

45:30.185 --> 45:32.353
where life support
is unstable.

45:32.479 --> 45:34.480

it might be dangerous.

SCOTT: lf it's okay
with you , sir,

46:00.090 --> 46:02.300
it might be best,
considering your
obvious skills,

46:02.384 --> 46:05.887
for you to hang back here
and help keep the rest
of these people calm .

46:05.971 --> 46:07.388

PARK: Fortunately for us,

46:37.002 --> 46:39.921
the life-support system
activated automatically
when we dialed the ship.

46:40.005 --> 46:43.007
Probably emergency reserves,
but only in certain sections.

46:43.091 --> 46:44.425
The reserve is gone.

46:44.509 --> 46:47.261
Life support's been
breaking down section
by section ever since.

46:47.346 --> 46:49.180
Resetting it doesn't help.

46:49.264 --> 46:51.474
l asked if there's
any progress.

46:51.558 --> 46:54.393
PARK: U nless something
changes, according to
my readings,

46:54.478 --> 46:57.897
we only have about
six to eight hours
of breathable air left.

46:57.981 --> 46:59.982
Okay, let me
put this another way.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.151

any good news?

47:17.584 --> 47:19.627
To find a bathroom .

47:19.711 --> 47:22.380
Yeah . That would
be good , too.

48:15.475 --> 48:17.852
General , we apparently have
a connection with the lab.

48:17.978 --> 48:19.979
Dr. Rush would
like to see you .

48:22.065 --> 48:25.443
General O'Neill .
l'm reporting to you from
onboard an Ancient spaceship

48:25.527 --> 48:26.902
somewhere far beyond
our known . . .

48:26.987 --> 48:28.529
J ust slow down ,
back up.

48:28.655 --> 48:29.739
Who's with you?

48:30.407 --> 48:34.410
Several dozen , l'm not sure,
but the point is, l did it.

48:35.162 --> 48:38.289
l successfully made
the connection to the
ninth chevron address.

48:38.373 --> 48:42.543
You were supposed
to be evacuating
non-combat personnel .

48:42.627 --> 48:44.086
To Earth !

48:44.171 --> 48:46.922
Colonel Young
gave that order, yes.
l overrode that decision .

48:47.049 --> 48:50.092
Did you , now?
lf you'd let me
explain , sir.

48:51.136 --> 48:54.221
Dialing Earth
was not an option .

48:54.306 --> 48:57.892
The core
of the planet P4X35 1
had become unstable,

48:57.976 --> 48:59.435
and if the
resulting blast

48:59.519 --> 49:02.188
had transferred through
the wormhole to Earth ,

49:02.314 --> 49:04.523
the effect would
have been catastrophic.

49:04.608 --> 49:06.025
So let me get
this straight.

49:06.777 --> 49:10.821
lnstead of dialing up
any one of a number of
other planets in our galaxy,

49:11.448 --> 49:14.617
you took a bunch
of unqualified people
halfway across the universe?

49:14.701 --> 49:19.955
l took what l thought
was our last chance to dial
the ninth and final chevron .

49:20.040 --> 49:21.791
l was successful .

49:21.875 --> 49:25.002
At that point,
the gate couldn't
be shut down again .

49:25.337 --> 49:26.962
Oh , my God .

49:29.716 --> 49:32.093
Rush , get those
people home.

49:47.067 --> 49:48.651
Are you all right?

49:48.735 --> 49:50.402

50:05.085 --> 50:08.337

this ship is unoccupied?

50:08.421 --> 50:11.382
Rush said the air came on
just before we got here.

like a bulkhead door.

01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:52.358
There's another door on
the back of the shuttle,

01:07:52.484 --> 01:07:53.985
but there's no control .

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:57.322
Then maybe we can
close it off locally.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:04.120
FRAN KLl N : The shield keeping
the air inside is obviously
not 1 00% effective.

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:07.290
RUSH : Probably wasn't
designed to compensate

01:08:07.374 --> 01:08:09.459
for the amount of damage
the ship has sustained .

01:08:09.543 --> 01:08:11.628
FRAN KLl N : ls there
a way of boosting it?

01:08:11.712 --> 01:08:13.880
At least in
the areas
we need it?

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:15.757
RUSH : We haven't
found a way yet.

01:08:15.841 --> 01:08:17.841
lt seems to be operating
at maximum capability.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.430
(ELl GASPl NG)

01:08:22.514 --> 01:08:24.015
ELl : Open the door!

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.773
Well , that's not good .

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:43.660
That's very good , sir.
A very good sign .

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:46.496
l don't have time
for this, do l?

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.290
Two problems.
We're venting atmosphere
from a damaged shuttle,

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:50.875
and even if we
could seal it off,

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.295
the life-support system
in this ship is past
its expiration date.

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:57.674
We'll build up CO2
to lethal levels
within a day.

01:08:58.008 --> 01:08:59.591
Well , that explains
the headache.

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:01.219
You already had one.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.220
They'll find a way.
That's what these
people do.

01:09:03.346 --> 01:09:05.430
Well , most of these
people aren't even
supposed to be here.

01:09:05.557 --> 01:09:07.642
How did the ship
get damaged?

01:09:07.725 --> 01:09:08.768
We don't know.

01:09:08.852 --> 01:09:10.687
lt certainly looks like
it's been through a battle,

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.814
at least the parts
we can access.

01:09:12.898 --> 01:09:15.316
We're still cut off
from most of the ship.
lt's huge.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:18.403
They tried jamming something
into the shuttle doorway to
keep it open

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.613
long enough to let
the person inside
get out. . .

01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:23.448
But it just
opens again .

01:09:23.575 --> 01:09:25.743
Some sort of
safety mechanism ,
like an elevator.

01:09:25.868 --> 01:09:27.245
Rush says
he can't override it.

01:09:28.037 --> 01:09:29.497
How long do we
have right now?

01:09:29.581 --> 01:09:30.790
As it stands. . .

01:09:30.916 --> 01:09:32.457
Rush says if we
don't get it closed ,
we've got. . .

01:09:32.584 --> 01:09:34.167
. . .just over an hour.

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:46.264
Bad air's better
than no air.

01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:50.727
Guess a day's
better than an hour.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:56.399
Someone's got to
go in there and
close this door.

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:05.616
My head is pounding .

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:09.620
Heartbeat has accelerated .
lt's getting harder
and harder to breathe,

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:14.709
as our very lives
are being vented
out into space.

01:10:14.793 --> 01:10:16.461
That is going to
get old very fast.

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.629
This needs to
be documented .
No one's going to see that.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.131
How do you know?

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:25.636
We made it here.
Someone else could , too.

01:10:29.808 --> 01:10:33.811
lf we die, maybe this can
help them to find out
what happened to us.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.480
Yeah , well ,
we're not dead yet.

01:10:41.153 --> 01:10:42.403
l'm starting to have
slightly blurred . . .

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:43.738
Eli !
What?

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:49.660
So how are we
going to decide who?

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.704
RUSH : l assume
we're not going to
get any volunteers.

01:10:53.665 --> 01:10:56.000
What's another day
going to buy us?

01:10:56.126 --> 01:10:58.419
Time, to find
a way to survive.

01:11:00.464 --> 01:11:02.006
May l see the list?

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:05.885
JOHANSEN : l marked the
names of anyone injured .

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:12.683
Right. We have to find out
people's skills, background ,
experience. . .

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:15.645
Doesn't take
any special skills to
die from asphyxiation !

01:11:15.729 --> 01:11:18.856
Look. What l'm saying is,
it shouldn't be someone

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.900
with potentially
valuable knowledge

01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:24.570
or abilities we
might need to help us
survive beyond this.

01:11:24.696 --> 01:11:26.197
Are you really suggesting

01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:27.657
what l think. . .
Half the people
on this ship

01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:29.450
already want
to kill you .

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:30.618
l don't care.

01:11:30.702 --> 01:11:34.038
You can't ask someone
to sacrifice themselves,
period .

01:11:34.915 --> 01:11:38.292
Politicians
ask military personnel
to sacrifice themselves

01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:40.878
for the good of others
all the time.

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:43.548
lf someone
doesn't go in there
and close that door,

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:46.175
we're all going
to die, period .

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:01.732
Franklin is still working at
the airlock controls locally,

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:03.860
but it doesn't
look good , sir.

01:12:03.944 --> 01:12:06.779

the situation
to everyone onboard .

01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:08.739
l'll do it.

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:09.866
Sir?

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:13.494
This isn't the kind of thing
l can ask somebody else to
volunteer for.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:16.247
lf we're going to make it
past this, we're going to
need you , sir.

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:19.333
l don't know about that.
You're doing a pretty good
job without me, Lieutenant.

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:21.002
Yeah? Well , look
at the mess we're in .

01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:22.670
lf that's not proof
that we need you , then . . .

01:12:22.754 --> 01:12:24.797
Look, l'm not sure
anyone should do it.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.841
l don't want
someone sacrificing
themselves for me.

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:28.843
l say we figure this
out together while
we still have time,

01:12:28.927 --> 01:12:29.969
or we all die trying .

01:12:30.053 --> 01:12:31.345
l want you to
both listen to me.

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:33.806

and l'm doing it.

you can barely stand .

01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:38.436
Help me.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.354
Look, the paralysis
is temporary.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.148
Help me.
You know that now.
You will recover.

01:12:42.274 --> 01:12:43.691
Lieutenant,
l need your help.
No, sir.

01:12:43.775 --> 01:12:45.443
l gave you an order.
l know.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.320
You can have me
court-martialed
when we get home,

01:12:47.404 --> 01:12:50.114
but l am not going to
help you kill yourself.

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:55.620

in his room .

01:20:22.734 --> 01:20:28.572
No matter how tired he was,
or how long he'd worked ,

01:20:29.866 --> 01:20:32.868
or what was going on
in his life,

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:36.246
he always had time
to listen to me.

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:40.751
l'd go on and on .

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:43.962
He never preached .

01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:50.552
He never told me
what to do, even though
sometimes l wished he would .

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.557
He would just listen .

01:20:57.894 --> 01:21:00.479
And then he would tell me
that he loved me.

01:21:03.942 --> 01:21:07.194
The best part was
if l'd had a fight
with my mom ,

01:21:07.278 --> 01:21:08.737
he never took sides.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.406
H mm .

01:21:11.282 --> 01:21:15.035
Oh , God . My mom .

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.456
He was her whole life.

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:25.045
She probably thinks
we're both dead .

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:28.590
All l know is that
he wanted you to go on .

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:32.386
l know.

01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:41.603
l got to get back
to the search .
You going to be okay?

01:21:42.647 --> 01:21:44.440
l don't know.

01:21:46.818 --> 01:21:48.444
Fair enough .

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:09.006
RUSH : Eli?

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.215
What?

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.342
What are you doing?

01:22:15.388 --> 01:22:18.766
l just watched a man die.

01:22:20.935 --> 01:22:22.269
Okay?

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.943
Don't you even care?

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:36.950
Of course l do,

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:40.788
and l'm also trying to
learn as much as l can ,
as quickly as l can .

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:45.083
That is,
in addition to running
nine separate searches

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:49.087
in the database
in the hope of solving
our life-support issues.

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:57.554
Right.

01:23:00.391 --> 01:23:02.267
Found anything?

01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:06.104
Destiny.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.901
As in ours?

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:15.197
The name of the ship.
Translated from Ancient.

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:20.077
l've also discovered
that they were never here.

01:23:21.579 --> 01:23:23.831
l thought this was
an Ancient ship.

01:23:23.915 --> 01:23:28.377
lt is, but they
sent it out unmanned ,

01:23:28.461 --> 01:23:30.629
planning to use
the gate to get here

01:23:30.713 --> 01:23:33.507
when it was far enough
out into the universe,

01:23:33.591 --> 01:23:37.177
but they probably
learned to Ascend
before that time.

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:39.471
Learned to what?

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:41.974
Ascension .

01:23:43.476 --> 01:23:47.479
lt's a process whereby
consciousness converts
to energy

01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:50.440
that no longer
requires physical form .

01:23:51.067 --> 01:23:52.818
That wasn't
in the video.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:56.029
Well , there's
more than one video.

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:00.409
We should get back to work.

01:24:05.957 --> 01:24:07.124
Sorry.

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:19.511
Sir, l think l got it.

01:24:20.346 --> 01:24:23.390
lt wasn't even that hard
to find . lt's right here
in the dialing program .

01:24:23.474 --> 01:24:24.641
You're sure?

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.393
Yes, it's an
eight-symbol address.

01:24:26.477 --> 01:24:28.604
You mean you can
dial this thing
back to Earth?

01:24:28.688 --> 01:24:29.897
There's no point
of origin indicated ,

01:24:29.981 --> 01:24:32.065
but still , there's
only 36 symbols
on this gate.

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:35.277
l'm assuming the
ninth symbol represents some
X-factor distance equation .

01:24:35.361 --> 01:24:37.654
Well , l don't care.
Start dialing .

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.865
Sir, don't we want to bring
Dr. Rush in on this?

01:24:39.949 --> 01:24:42.117
YOU NG : Well ,
you said this wasn't
that hard to find?

01:24:42.201 --> 01:24:43.243
No.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:46.496
Well , then he probably
already knows
and didn't tell us.

01:24:47.832 --> 01:24:50.375
Who is this
Lucian Alliance anyway?

01:24:51.002 --> 01:24:52.920
Where did that
come from?

01:24:53.004 --> 01:24:54.922
l just want to know
who to blame for this.

01:24:55.298 --> 01:25:00.177
They're a human coalition
made up from various
Milky Way planets,

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:04.514
formed in the power vacuum
left behind when the Goa'uld
were defeated .

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:08.268
They're criminals mostly.
A street gang with starships.

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:10.437
How'd they find out
about lcarus?

01:25:10.521 --> 01:25:12.773
Wasn't it supposed to be,
like, double secret?

01:25:12.857 --> 01:25:14.775
l suspect there was
a leak somewhere.

01:25:14.859 --> 01:25:16.652
Someone working
on the inside.

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:19.947
The legend surrounding
the ninth chevron

01:25:20.031 --> 01:25:22.699
has been floating
around our galaxy
for some time now.

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:27.537
We found that it meant
various things
to different cultures.

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:30.999
Some said
it was a key to
the universe itself.

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:34.544
And once unlocked ,
you would gain
untold power.

01:25:35.046 --> 01:25:37.381
Now, if the Lucian Alliance
knew that we'd discovered

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:41.385
the address and
a means to dial ,
they'd want it.

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:44.888
This ship is a source
of untold power?

01:25:45.014 --> 01:25:49.393
No, no, not literally.
lt's more to do with
what it's doing .

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:51.395
The information it's
capable of gathering .

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:53.313
lf you know
how to use it.

01:25:53.398 --> 01:25:54.481
Yeah .

01:25:54.565 --> 01:25:56.233
That's what
you're after,
isn't it?

01:25:56.359 --> 01:25:58.568
Why you risked everything
to get here.

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:01.655
You think this ship
is going to make you
all-powerful

01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:03.573
or something crazy
like that?

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.411
Eli . . .

01:26:09.622 --> 01:26:14.334
lf l could find a way
to send all these people
home safely

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:17.754
and then return with
a properly skilled team

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:22.300
to pursue this mission
as intended , why wouldn't
l want to do that?

01:26:25.096 --> 01:26:26.179
l don't know.

01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:29.016
U h-huh .
Now turn that thing off.

01:26:30.184 --> 01:26:31.435
You saw that?

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:41.987
(ALARM BEEPl NG)

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:44.448
Oh , no, no, no, no.
What?

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:46.199
Someone's dialing the gate.

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.883
Colonel Young .
You're up.

01:27:02.967 --> 01:27:04.801
N ice to see you , too, Rush .

01:27:04.927 --> 01:27:06.720
l did order you
to report to me.

01:27:06.804 --> 01:27:08.555
Yes, but what
are you doing?

01:27:08.639 --> 01:27:10.223
We're trying
to dial Earth .

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:11.558
RUSH : That would be
a mistake.

01:27:11.642 --> 01:27:13.477
YOU NG : Riley thinks
he's found the address
for home.

01:27:13.603 --> 01:27:16.146
RUSH : H is understanding
of Ancient is marginal
at best.

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:19.149
Rl LEY: With respect, Doctor,
l know enough to recognize
a reference to Earth .

01:27:19.275 --> 01:27:21.735
He says the address wasn't
that hard to find , Rush .

01:27:21.819 --> 01:27:23.987
No, no. This is a complete
waste of power we may need .

01:27:24.071 --> 01:27:26.823
We have the address back.
All we need is the
right point of origin .

01:27:26.949 --> 01:27:28.408
And we've got 36 tries.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:31.328
We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

01:27:31.621 --> 01:27:34.748
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth .

01:27:34.832 --> 01:27:36.833
You see,
that's news to me.

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:38.043
He didn't tell
me that, either.

01:27:38.127 --> 01:27:39.336
Well , l've only
just learned myself,

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.504
and you know what
l've been doing .

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:41.838
Even if it doesn't work,

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:44.841
the people aboard this ship
need to see us at least try.

01:27:44.967 --> 01:27:46.760
So, what, you're
going to drain what
little power we have

01:27:46.844 --> 01:27:48.094
for the sake of morale?

01:27:48.179 --> 01:27:49.429
How ridiculous.

01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:50.931
(SH l P G ROANS)

01:27:54.685 --> 01:27:55.852
What was that?

01:27:55.978 --> 01:27:57.020
(BEEPl NG)

01:27:59.690 --> 01:28:01.733
YOU NG : Anyone near
the observation deck?

01:28:09.867 --> 01:28:12.869
Colonel , it looks like
we've dropped out of FTL.

01:28:13.204 --> 01:28:15.038
Rl LEY: Because we
were draining power?

01:28:15.122 --> 01:28:16.373
No, no.

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:21.378
lf l'm right,
the gate should begin
to dial any moment.

01:28:28.719 --> 01:28:30.971
How did you know that?

01:28:31.055 --> 01:28:33.640
The ship
detected a stargate

01:28:33.724 --> 01:28:36.309
on a planet within range
that may have what we need .

01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:40.146
What? How the hell
are there even
stargates out here?

01:28:41.232 --> 01:28:45.569
The Ancients sent out
a number of unmanned ships
ahead of this one.

01:28:45.778 --> 01:28:49.114
They're programed
to gather data,
resources,

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.784
to manufacture stargates
and deposit them
in habitable worlds.

01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:56.413
Any relevant information
is relayed back here
to help plot the course.

01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:59.541
You're telling me
that this ship knows
we're in trouble?

01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:01.626
Yes, because
l told it we were.

01:29:02.211 --> 01:29:05.422
Essentially,
we're flying
on autopilot.

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:07.924
This ship may have stopped
when it was within range
of a stargate

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:09.384
regardless of our need .

01:29:10.094 --> 01:29:11.344
But l have reason
to believe. . .

01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:20.228
YOU NG : So, what we need
is on the other side of
that wormhole?

01:29:20.563 --> 01:29:23.106
An educated guess, yes.

01:29:24.650 --> 01:29:26.526
There's only
one way to find out.

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:29.321
Rl LEY: Sir, you can't
do that. We have no idea
what's on the other side.

01:29:29.405 --> 01:29:31.907
We can use the Kino
to find out.

01:29:31.991 --> 01:29:34.409
l expect that's
the purpose of
this device.

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:43.293
l'm getting readings
over here.

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:44.419
What have we got?

01:29:44.503 --> 01:29:48.048
Temperature, gravity,
atmosphere composition ,

01:29:48.132 --> 01:29:49.341
barometric pressure.

01:29:49.425 --> 01:29:52.802
Oxygen , nitrogen ,
very little CO2,
extremely low humidity.

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:54.471
Habitable,
but just barely.

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:55.639
Good enough .

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:58.600
BRODY: Looks like
four other addresses
came up here, too.

01:30:00.311 --> 01:30:02.354
They could be other
planets within range.

01:30:02.438 --> 01:30:04.147
Maybe we should think about
dialing them up and seeing . . .

01:30:04.231 --> 01:30:05.857
No, no, no,
they're locked out.

01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:07.776
The ship chose this one.

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.779
The stargate is open ,
all we have to do
is step through .

01:30:10.863 --> 01:30:13.281
What we have to do
is put a team together.

01:30:13.366 --> 01:30:14.866
Dr. Rush .

01:30:16.786 --> 01:30:18.536
RUSH : Looks like
our time might be
limited .

01:30:18.621 --> 01:30:19.704
YOU NG : What is it?

01:30:19.789 --> 01:30:22.749
lt's a countdown .
J ust over 1 2 hours left.

01:30:22.833 --> 01:30:24.250
What happens then?

01:30:24.335 --> 01:30:27.087
l suspect we
jump back into FTL.

01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:38.098
Palmer is a geologist.
Obviously she should go.

01:30:38.182 --> 01:30:40.684
Franklin and Brody
are the best of the
rest of what we have.

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:42.435
Thanks for the
ringing endorsement.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.145
He didn't even
mention me.

01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:46.147
YOU NG : Franklin goes.
The others stay.

01:30:46.816 --> 01:30:49.693
We're still going to need
good people working on
the problem from this end .

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.069
ELl : l'd like to go.

01:30:53.072 --> 01:30:54.322
Really?

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:56.199
lf l can help, then . . .

01:30:56.325 --> 01:30:57.492
Colonel Young , please.

01:30:57.576 --> 01:31:00.286
What? You don't think
l can handle it?

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:02.080
He's going .

01:31:02.206 --> 01:31:03.748
l've been
off-world before.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:07.210
You have made a habit
out of pulling our asses
out of the fire.

01:31:07.336 --> 01:31:09.879
Eli , you want to go,
you're going .

01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:15.385
The only one l'm
questioning right now
is you , Dr. Rush .

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.803
(SCOFFS)

01:31:16.887 --> 01:31:20.557
Well , besides Palmer,
l'm the only one who knows
what we're looking for.

01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:23.226
We have 1 2 hours to find
what we need and then
get back on the ship.

01:31:23.352 --> 01:31:24.394
You're sure
you can't stop it?

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.770
No, we're just along
for the ride for now.

01:31:25.896 --> 01:31:28.064
Then we may all be
better off on the planet.

01:31:29.066 --> 01:31:31.026

whether long-term survival
there is even an option .

01:31:35.698 --> 01:31:37.949

that Scott is in charge
of this mission .

whatever supplies we have,
and move out.

Sir, about Eli . . .

01:31:57.344 --> 01:31:58.678
He volunteered .

01:31:58.763 --> 01:31:59.888
He's not trained for this.

we got on the ship.

what they're made of.

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:04.934
He'll slow us down .

you send him back
to the gate.

make it, and l'm not just
talking the next few hours,

could be dinosaurs?

we can dial back

That would be good .

01:33:52.835 --> 01:33:54.085
Why?

01:33:54.211 --> 01:33:55.795
We're looking for
calcium carbonate.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.255
RUSH : Calcite.

01:33:57.339 --> 01:34:01.551
Gypsum is calcium sulfate,
which is
36% calcium carbonate.

01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:02.719
ELl : H mm .

01:34:09.435 --> 01:34:11.227

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:13.438
Are you saying
we can use this sand
to fix the scrubbers?

01:34:13.564 --> 01:34:15.064
That would be convenient.
PALMER: (SlG HS) No.

01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:17.942
RUSH : Well , it's
a fair indication that the
components may exist nearby.

01:34:18.068 --> 01:34:19.611
PALMER: For the sake
of portability
and efficiency,

01:34:19.737 --> 01:34:23.364
l'm hoping to find
high-concentration
granular limestone.

01:34:23.449 --> 01:34:25.116
We are looking for
the dried lake bed

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:27.827
or salt-water body
all this sand came from .

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:30.121
lt's a desert.

01:34:31.123 --> 01:34:34.083
Lime is formed mostly
from the remains of
marine organisms.

Are you saying
there was life here?

01:34:36.128 --> 01:34:38.254
RUSH : Not likely anything
we've seen before.

01:34:44.511 --> 01:34:46.137
Yeah , the water
may be gone now,

01:34:46.263 --> 01:34:50.099
but this desert was formed
by H2O evaporating
on a playa floor,

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:53.603
causing gypsum to be deposited
in a fine crystalline form
called selenite.

ls that supposed to happen?

01:35:05.491 --> 01:35:08.451
PALMER: lf this sand
is high enough in
calcite concentration ,

01:35:08.535 --> 01:35:10.703
the solution
would absorb the acid .

01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:13.248
Right.
The liquid would turn clear.

l just have this really,
really sick feeling

01:43:51.808 --> 01:43:53.893
that you're going
to go that way,

01:43:53.977 --> 01:43:55.728

to go this way.

that l can trust to lead
the second team , okay?

01:43:59.316 --> 01:44:00.858
That is you .

01:44:01.234 --> 01:44:03.235
Curtis is a good soldier.
He's a tough guy.

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.154
He's not going to let
anything happen to you .

01:44:05.238 --> 01:44:07.907
Truth is, l'm slowing
you down and you want
to get rid of me.

will best accomplish
this mission .

You asked to come.

01:44:13.121 --> 01:44:15.956
l'm telling you
how you can help me.
Now suck it up.

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:19.335
Yeah . Okay.

01:44:21.838 --> 01:44:26.217

we're going this way.

find the lake bed ,
we'll double back.

the Statue of Liberty,
you know what to say, right?

01:44:33.558 --> 01:44:36.519
Right. Now we can
make some time.

to tell you .

01:45:49.426 --> 01:45:53.095
The thought that
you're actually
on some ship

01:45:53.179 --> 01:45:55.264
so far away,
l can't even imagine.

you're coming home.

Mom , please !

01:46:13.366 --> 01:46:15.784
The ship is
old and damaged .

01:46:17.037 --> 01:46:19.830
We were losing air
and somebody had to. . .

01:46:22.334 --> 01:46:23.792
He's dead .

01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:26.003

MEHTA: Where is everyone?

01:46:47.233 --> 01:46:48.567
Able bodies are
searching the ship

01:46:48.652 --> 01:46:51.612
for anything that might have
CO2 sequestration properties,

01:46:51.696 --> 01:46:53.489
and the rest are
in crew quarters.

01:47:02.123 --> 01:47:04.208
Colonel , we were
able to dial out
to the planet again .

01:47:04.292 --> 01:47:06.669
JOHANSEN : Colonel Young
and Chloe are using
the communication stones.

This is Colonel Telford ,
Dr. Mehta.

01:47:09.255 --> 01:47:12.466
U h . . . Right. Okay.

01:47:13.385 --> 01:47:15.552
Did you make radio contact
with the off-world team?

01:47:16.179 --> 01:47:18.722
Yes, nothing to report yet.
They've split up.

01:47:18.848 --> 01:47:21.016
How much time
before the ship
jumps back to FTL?

01:47:21.142 --> 01:47:23.060
Roughly nine hours.

01:47:23.186 --> 01:47:25.396
Dial out every 20 minutes.
Maintain regular contact.

01:47:25.522 --> 01:47:27.648
We do have power issues
to be aware of.

01:47:27.732 --> 01:47:29.274
Dialing the gate is
a significant drain

01:47:29.359 --> 01:47:31.485
on what seems to be
limited resources
at this point.

01:47:31.569 --> 01:47:34.363

Sir?
l'm fine.

01:47:36.574 --> 01:47:38.909
l understand that
there are other
stargates in range.

01:47:39.035 --> 01:47:40.911
Four other addresses
came up in the system ,

01:47:41.037 --> 01:47:42.287
but we seem to be
locked out from here.

01:47:42.372 --> 01:47:43.622
Well , have you tried
working around it?

01:47:43.707 --> 01:47:45.749
Dr. Rush didn't think
that was a good idea.

01:47:45.875 --> 01:47:48.419
l think it makes sense to
know what our options are,
so do what you can .

01:47:48.545 --> 01:47:51.088
There has to be a good
reason why these addresses
are being disqualified .

01:47:51.214 --> 01:47:53.716
lf l wasn't being clear,
l was giving you an order.

01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:57.177

find out exactly what
they are.

something for the pain .

The body feels pain
for a reason . l would
rather not mask it.

J ust do it, Lieutenant.
From the sound of things,
you need my help here.

All right, come on .
Let's go.

01:48:23.329 --> 01:48:24.955
You better save
some of that.

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:27.249
We need to slow down .

01:48:27.333 --> 01:48:29.334
We need to cover
more ground .

01:48:29.419 --> 01:48:32.004

impossible to maintain
this pace on the way back.

and then we start
circling back.

That was supposed
to be for the pain .
What did you give to him?

A strong sedative,
which we are
desperately short on

01:50:09.519 --> 01:50:11.520

have had to use just
so that Colonel Young

in working condition .

There are four other
viable addresses
in this thing .

an override that'll allow
us to dial from here. . .

01:51:28.932 --> 01:51:31.558

This planet
is a dead zone.

We should've been trying

01:51:33.019 --> 01:51:34.645
to dial these other
planets from the start.

what Rush said .

Rush doesn't
want us all to die.

we trust him to make
the right decisions.

of miles from here.

We could be blowing
our only chance at finding
a decent place to evac.

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:58.251
Maybe the ship did
bring us here because
there's lime on this planet.

01:51:58.336 --> 01:51:59.378
For all we know,

01:51:59.462 --> 01:52:01.922
the Ancients had a way
of locating it that
we don't.

01:52:02.006 --> 01:52:03.715
For that matter,
l'm sure they could've
stopped the ship

01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:06.969
for longer than 1 2 hours
to find it and recover it
with the proper tools.

01:52:07.053 --> 01:52:10.055
The fact is,
the Ancients wouldn't have
let the life-support system

in the first place.

was our only way
back to the ship.

get another one.

does it make?

Because if l don't
find what we need ,

to find some other way
to save his own ass,

for another planet
