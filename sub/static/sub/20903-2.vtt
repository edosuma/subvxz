00:00.038 --> 00:02.719
<i>- Previously on</i> Stitchers...
- I don't love you!

00:02.744 --> 00:05.297
- It was me. I said those things.
- Do you think we can trust Ivy?

00:05.322 --> 00:06.632
I'm not a hundred percent sure.

00:06.657 --> 00:08.523
I know what quantum computers are

00:08.548 --> 00:10.266
and how entanglement triggers work.

00:10.291 --> 00:11.932
He had surgery a couple days ago,

00:11.957 --> 00:14.406
and since we're locked down,
I have no idea how he's doing.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.781
Call. Find out.

00:15.806 --> 00:17.670
He died. The funeral was yesterday.

00:17.695 --> 00:20.523
- You know where she is.
- I do. Your mother's alive and well.

00:20.548 --> 00:21.680
One day, you'll be reunited with her.

00:21.705 --> 00:23.787
Kristin, what is it?
Will you talk to me, dammit?

00:23.812 --> 00:24.937
Cameron, you okay there?

00:24.962 --> 00:26.594
Blair wants to kill your mother.

00:26.619 --> 00:28.701
Find out where she is and
find a way to tell me.

00:28.726 --> 00:30.547
- Why are we here?
- To make a deal.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.667
My colleagues are being reassigned,
I don't want that to happen.

00:32.692 --> 00:33.489
Anything else?

00:33.514 --> 00:35.828
I want Maggie Baptiste to
run the Stitchers program.

00:35.853 --> 00:36.454
Is that it?

00:36.479 --> 00:38.720
No. I'm looking for someone. My mother.

00:38.745 --> 00:41.913
How long would you have waited for
me when I was trapped in my memory?

00:41.938 --> 00:43.112
Forever.

00:43.137 --> 00:44.804
When you were trying
to get me to bounce,

00:44.829 --> 00:46.541
wh... what did you mean when you said...

00:46.566 --> 00:48.621
You can't help me if
you're stuck in here.

00:48.646 --> 00:51.401
- I never said that.
- But if you didn't say it, who did?

_

01:58.802 --> 02:01.636
Ugh, thank god you're here.
What did you bring me for breakfast?

02:01.661 --> 02:03.964
I didn't know I was supposed to.

02:03.989 --> 02:08.996
You know, considering it was
my idea to go all <i>Mommy Dearest</i>

02:09.020 --> 02:12.222
on Kirsten in the stitch, I thought
I might be at least worth a latte.

02:12.247 --> 02:15.469
Also, you don't come to a
person's house empty-handed.

02:15.494 --> 02:16.493
Were you raised in a barn?

02:16.518 --> 02:18.872
- So, is Kirsten up or...
- Up and out.

02:18.897 --> 02:19.997
Oh. Where to?

02:20.022 --> 02:22.767
I'm a lotta things, Cameron.

02:22.792 --> 02:24.817
Blondie's keeper is not one of them.

02:24.842 --> 02:25.950
- Mm.
- Speaking of...

02:25.975 --> 02:27.622
- Hm.
- How are you and Kirsten?

02:27.647 --> 02:30.192
- Oh.
- Did you guys, you know...

02:31.552 --> 02:33.301
- do it?
- What are you, 12?

02:33.326 --> 02:35.753
I'm just saying. You know, be gentle.

02:35.778 --> 02:37.192
Kirsten's a virgin.

02:37.552 --> 02:40.128
Ahh, I don't think she's a virgin.

02:40.153 --> 02:42.340
Emotionally. Come on.

02:42.365 --> 02:44.205
She's a virgin.

02:44.230 --> 02:47.254
This is gonna be her
first real relationship

02:47.279 --> 02:50.346
where she's connected and available,
you know?

02:50.371 --> 02:51.537
I got it.

02:51.794 --> 02:52.931
I don't know if you do.

02:52.956 --> 02:56.624
I'm tryin' to say...
go slow, if you can.

02:56.649 --> 02:59.981
'Cause this thing that you
two have affects all of us.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.371
Yeah, I said I got it.

03:02.406 --> 03:04.761
Yeah? And what was up in
the lab with you yesterday?

03:04.786 --> 03:06.200
Your hands were shakin' pretty good.

03:06.225 --> 03:09.147
I was just tired.
It was a crazy couple days, you know?

03:09.172 --> 03:12.527
I guess so. You know what?
Go ahead and get the eggs out.

03:12.552 --> 03:14.519
I'm gonna get dressed while
you make me breakfast.

03:14.554 --> 03:17.822
- How do you like 'em?
- Prepared by someone other than me.

03:34.557 --> 03:36.189
Sabine.

03:37.257 --> 03:38.719
Sabine?

03:39.680 --> 03:41.546
Where did you go?

03:41.581 --> 03:43.242
Sabine!

03:51.053 --> 03:52.537
Sabine!

- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -

04:25.216 --> 04:27.726
Hey. You seen Kirsten yet?

04:27.761 --> 04:29.824
I have not, but I just got in myself.

04:29.849 --> 04:32.427
Oh. How's your mom holdin' up?

04:32.452 --> 04:33.484
- She's good.
- Mm?

04:33.509 --> 04:35.161
- A rock.
- How about you?

04:35.452 --> 04:37.218
A little less rock-like,

04:37.243 --> 04:40.178
but, um, my father was my hero,

04:40.203 --> 04:41.778
and I'm gonna soldier
on and make him proud.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.193
- I know you will.
- Thanks, man.

04:44.218 --> 04:45.584
Yeah.

04:45.609 --> 04:48.232
Hey, uh, I gotta go and talk to Maggie.

04:48.257 --> 04:50.573
- What about?
- Stuff.

04:50.598 --> 04:52.598
Stuff? Uh-huh.

04:54.497 --> 04:56.090
- Minute?
- Barely.

04:56.115 --> 04:57.201
- Question.
- Go.

04:57.226 --> 04:59.215
- Ivy.
- No.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.551
Look, I know that you're feeling

05:00.576 --> 05:02.817
a connection with her
and that she helped you

05:02.842 --> 05:03.975
find out about your father.

05:04.010 --> 05:06.544
- She helped all of us.
- And still, I don't trust her,

05:06.579 --> 05:07.578
and neither should you.

05:07.614 --> 05:08.771
I get it. Stinger had her ear,

05:08.796 --> 05:09.693
and there's no way of knowing

05:09.718 --> 05:11.382
what kind of Manson family brain laundry

05:11.407 --> 05:12.639
was goin' on between the two of 'em.

05:12.664 --> 05:14.630
Oddly but accurately stated.

05:14.655 --> 05:16.864
Who knows what her connection is to him?

05:16.889 --> 05:18.305
I could just ask her.

05:19.138 --> 05:20.488
- Done?
- Yes.

05:20.513 --> 05:21.513
- Bye.
- Good.

05:22.273 --> 05:23.965
Oh! There you are.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.638
- Ooh. You miss me?
- I miss running tests on you.

05:27.663 --> 05:30.498
Best boyfriend, ever.

05:30.523 --> 05:32.957
I know. So, I re-watched the lab video

05:32.982 --> 05:34.896
of when you bounced
from your memory loop.

05:34.921 --> 05:37.388
The "You can't help me"
comment you think I said.

05:37.413 --> 05:39.258
- Never said it.
- Maybe I imagined it?

05:39.283 --> 05:41.113
That's possibility number three.

05:41.138 --> 05:43.035
Number one is that
Stinger said it to you

05:43.060 --> 05:44.068
from the hijacked signal.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.993
- What's number two?
- That the days you were trapped

05:46.018 --> 05:46.943
in the stitch affected you.

05:46.968 --> 05:48.865
- You mean damaged me?
- I didn't say that.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.943
I just wanna run some
tests. I'm worried.

05:51.216 --> 05:53.550
I'm fine. Cameron, we
have a stitch to do.

05:53.575 --> 05:55.274
We're gonna do it.
We're gonna keep perfecting

05:55.299 --> 05:58.013
the technology, and I'm gonna be fine.

05:58.038 --> 06:00.342
So don't be a baby, baby.

06:02.581 --> 06:04.622
Hey, do you wanna get
some dinner tonight?

06:04.647 --> 06:06.213
I think we should talk.

06:07.219 --> 06:09.185
Okay, about what?

06:09.210 --> 06:10.365
Us.

06:10.390 --> 06:13.685
We're up.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.597
About us? Now I'm worried.

06:20.995 --> 06:22.934
Victim's name is Sabine Colt.

06:22.959 --> 06:24.825
She's the daughter of
an investment banker,

06:24.861 --> 06:27.027
born and raised in New York City,
but she's been living here

06:27.052 --> 06:28.560
in LA with her boyfriend, Nic.

06:28.585 --> 06:29.851
- Cause of death?
- Drowning.

06:29.876 --> 06:31.024
There were signs of a struggle.

06:31.049 --> 06:32.826
The M.E. will have a full workup soon.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.536
Police are questioning
the boyfriend now.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.459
- What do we know about him?
- FWell, he's got money,

06:36.484 --> 06:38.363
and lots of it. But a guy that young

06:38.388 --> 06:39.654
usually doesn't punch his own ticket,

06:39.689 --> 06:41.036
so I'm checkin' on
who's payin' the bills.

06:41.061 --> 06:43.575
Okay, in the meantime,
let's start with Sabine.

06:48.818 --> 06:50.784
- All right, Kirsten, you ready?
- Absolutely.

06:50.820 --> 06:52.256
'Cause if you're not,
you know, we can...

06:54.382 --> 06:56.282
Is this thing on?
I thought I said, "Absolutely."

06:56.307 --> 06:57.631
Yeah, it's on, smart-ass.

06:57.656 --> 06:59.428
Lights to 20%, please.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.951
Are you ready?

07:01.237 --> 07:02.458
I'm fine.

07:02.613 --> 07:05.012
I need a go, no-go for
stitch neuro-sync. Life-Sci?

07:05.037 --> 07:06.223
- Go.
- Sub-Bio?

07:06.248 --> 07:07.482
- Go.
- Engineering?

07:07.507 --> 07:08.576
- Go.
- Communications?

07:08.601 --> 07:09.857
- Go.
- Medical?

07:09.882 --> 07:12.396
- Go.
- Com check, one-two, one-two.

07:13.624 --> 07:15.044
Is this on?

07:15.069 --> 07:17.575
- I guess I deserved that.
- Induce stitch neurosync

07:17.600 --> 07:20.912
on my mark in three, two, one, mark!

07:24.881 --> 07:26.815
It's Nic and Sabine.

07:26.850 --> 07:28.715
They're having drinks.

07:30.210 --> 07:31.535
It's very romantic.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.544
Really sweet.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.513
Okay, new memory.

07:41.943 --> 07:44.482
- Things are heating up.
- What are they doing, K?

07:44.507 --> 07:47.802
Um. Hm. The deed.

07:47.827 --> 07:49.810
I'm getting a spotty
neuro-sync on Kirsten.

07:49.835 --> 07:51.544
Yeah, yeah, I'm seein' that, too.

07:51.569 --> 07:52.803
Are you all right, Kirsten?

07:52.827 --> 07:58.110
Fine, just... watching.

07:58.276 --> 08:00.189
Her respiration is up.

08:00.214 --> 08:01.462
Heart rate, too.

08:01.487 --> 08:03.917
Her oxytocin levels
are rising in response

08:03.942 --> 08:05.431
to what she's seeing in the stitch.

08:05.456 --> 08:07.251
I'll have what she's having.

08:07.276 --> 08:10.344
If you want, we can leave you there
for a little while, come back later.

08:12.468 --> 08:14.634
- Huh?
- Memory hotspot comin' up.

08:14.659 --> 08:16.993
All right, you're on the move, Sally.

08:17.234 --> 08:19.961
I'm... on a street somewhere.

08:19.986 --> 08:23.400
It's... It's in New York, I think.
It's... it's foggy.

08:23.425 --> 08:25.259
Sabine!

08:25.284 --> 08:26.861
Weather foggy or brain foggy?

08:26.886 --> 08:28.634
I told you, please don't worry about me.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.530
- Yeah.
- You take care of your parents,

08:35.554 --> 08:36.650
we'll take care of you.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.438
Just stick to the plan.

08:38.464 --> 08:41.173
Some guy just gave her a phone.

08:41.198 --> 08:43.131
Wait, I'm be...
I'm being pulled to another memory.

08:43.157 --> 08:47.202
They're canoodling again.

08:48.744 --> 08:52.780
- Whatever happened...
- to the big contract...

08:52.805 --> 08:55.265
your father was hoping to get?

08:55.290 --> 08:58.632
Uh, Sabine's asking about Nic's father.

08:58.906 --> 08:59.901
He got it.

08:59.926 --> 09:02.570
Heart rate and respiration
are climbing again.

09:02.595 --> 09:04.047
There's something about a contract.

09:04.072 --> 09:06.117
Contract. On it.

09:06.142 --> 09:08.734
Uh, I'm seeing unlock
codes for the phone.

09:08.759 --> 09:10.328
- Have her call them out.
- What are they?

09:10.353 --> 09:13.953
1-2-3-5.

09:14.301 --> 09:17.820
2-4-6-1.

09:18.150 --> 09:20.936
8-7-6-4.

09:26.803 --> 09:29.185
I'm in a field.

09:32.953 --> 09:34.920
Sabine has a messenger bag.

09:34.955 --> 09:36.054
What's in the bag?

09:36.089 --> 09:39.008
It's too foggy, I can't make it out.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.390
Here we go again...

09:52.849 --> 09:55.567
They're... they're having pool sex.

09:55.592 --> 09:56.975
As in sex in the pool?

09:57.010 --> 09:59.016
Completely overrated.

09:59.041 --> 10:01.142
That's a true fact.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.616
Comin' up on the death memory.

10:03.641 --> 10:05.709
Where are you going?

10:07.220 --> 10:08.420
Hey!

10:08.455 --> 10:10.481
Nick! Where'd you go?

10:10.506 --> 10:12.335
Aren't we swimming?

10:16.459 --> 10:19.241
- What's happening?
- Death memory in four seconds.

10:19.266 --> 10:21.436
Kirsten, get outta there!

10:23.140 --> 10:24.940
Ayo, how's Kirsten?

10:24.965 --> 10:26.692
Chill, Cameron, I'm fine.

10:26.717 --> 10:28.751
Do you need anything,
like a water or oxygen?

10:28.776 --> 10:30.552
- Cold shower?
- Knock it off.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.355
Sabine was spying on Nic.
She shared information

10:33.391 --> 10:35.295
about his father's business
with that guy in New York.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.452
So Nic found out and killed her.

10:36.477 --> 10:38.437
No, he... he didn't do it.

10:38.462 --> 10:40.858
- Maybe he set her up.
- I don't think so.

10:40.883 --> 10:42.916
If Nic didn't do it, then who?

10:42.941 --> 10:44.975
Nic's father.

10:48.670 --> 10:53.552
Viktor Comenko, Nic's father, is a
powerful businessman with loads of moolah.

10:53.577 --> 10:56.763
His company, Novogorsk Steel,
just landed a huge contract

10:56.788 --> 10:57.959
with the Russian military.

10:57.984 --> 10:59.967
That must be the contract
Nic told Sabine about.

10:59.992 --> 11:03.514
She passed on inside information
she got from Nic, pissed off Daddy,

11:03.539 --> 11:05.326
- and he killed Sabine?
- Mm, if Comenko

11:05.351 --> 11:08.186
had anything to do with it,
he didn't do it himself.

11:08.211 --> 11:10.893
Because the big man never leaves,
say it with me now...

11:10.918 --> 11:12.239
Mother Russia.

11:12.264 --> 11:13.772
Why? Because he's paranoid.

11:13.797 --> 11:16.631
Survived three different attempts
on his life in the past seven years.

11:16.656 --> 11:18.373
Never travels without private security.

11:18.398 --> 11:20.765
- So he paid someone else to do it.
- Mmm, maybe.

11:20.790 --> 11:23.788
But he's notorious for running
the entire operation himself.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.746
Doesn't think anybody
can do as good a job

11:25.771 --> 11:26.904
at anything as he can.

11:26.929 --> 11:28.796
That might not extend to murder.

11:28.821 --> 11:31.678
Apparently, the only person
Viktor trusts is his son, Nic.

11:31.703 --> 11:35.335
By all accounts, Nic is as loyal
to Daddy as Daddy is to him.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.154
Right. So even though
Nic didn't kill Sabine,

11:37.179 --> 11:38.725
he might know more than he told police.

11:38.750 --> 11:40.334
Okay, bring him in, get him talking.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.249
While Nic's here,
Cameron and I will go search his house,

11:42.274 --> 11:46.164
see if we can find the encrypted
phone and the messenger bag.

12:00.358 --> 12:02.325
Word's out that you're a computer whiz.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.662
NSA sent me over to audit your class.

12:05.263 --> 12:06.899
That's cute.

12:06.924 --> 12:09.133
- What you really doin' here?
- I never got a chance

12:09.158 --> 12:10.891
to say thank you for what you did for me

12:10.916 --> 12:12.115
back at the lab.

12:12.140 --> 12:13.939
Letting me call my mother.

12:15.603 --> 12:20.228
I'm sorry, um... that you didn't get
the news you wanted about your father.

12:20.836 --> 12:23.275
At least I found out, so thank you.

12:25.053 --> 12:26.653
Look, I gotta ask you straight up.

12:26.688 --> 12:28.307
Are you still working with Stinger?

12:28.420 --> 12:32.522
No. I am not working with my father.

12:32.547 --> 12:35.214
He made me think there was this big plan

12:35.239 --> 12:36.583
to get the family all back together,

12:36.608 --> 12:41.626
but... Kirsten was right.
He's absolutely psychotic.

12:42.389 --> 12:44.736
Linus, um, I've got class.

12:44.919 --> 12:49.938
If you wanna practice GarageBand
or learn basic programming, stay.

12:49.962 --> 12:54.111
If you wanna keep grilling me about
my dad, it's not gonna happen.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.994
Look, first, GarageBand is really cool.

12:58.095 --> 13:02.267
And second, no more grilling. I...
I believe you.

13:03.102 --> 13:05.689
Might be better if you didn't.

13:06.266 --> 13:10.235
It's just... it's
gonna get in the way...

13:10.626 --> 13:12.492
of you and your friends.
They're like your family.

13:12.517 --> 13:14.314
Yeah, but Kirsten is literally yours.

13:14.339 --> 13:18.475
Yeah. It's a relationship I'd
like to build outside of the lab.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.665
Linus, I've got class.

13:23.492 --> 13:25.571
Yeah, I... I... I should get goin', too.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.423
Thanks.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.836
Hey... what are you doin' later?
Do you wanna hang out, maybe?

13:30.861 --> 13:32.377
Are you asking me out?

13:32.402 --> 13:34.873
Yeah. I thought it was pretty obvious.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.220
I have parent-teacher
conferences tonight.

13:37.245 --> 13:39.078
Yeah.

13:39.103 --> 13:40.931
You can pick me up at 8:00.

13:56.717 --> 13:58.584
Okay. Let's talk about Sabine.

13:58.609 --> 13:59.822
This is a waste of time.

13:59.847 --> 14:03.521
Okay? I loved Sabine. And whoever
killed her, I want them dead.

14:03.546 --> 14:06.079
Okay. You loved her.

14:06.785 --> 14:08.478
But did you trust her?

14:09.470 --> 14:11.556
Yeah. Of course.

14:11.800 --> 14:15.337
Then who was she talking to
on her super-secret phone?

14:16.519 --> 14:17.879
What secret phone?

14:17.904 --> 14:19.812
Oh, you know,
it's the type of phone you would use

14:19.837 --> 14:23.939
to cheat on your husband, or make a call
from a prison cell, or in Sabine's case,

14:23.974 --> 14:25.908
talk about your boyfriend
with nefarious types

14:25.943 --> 14:27.843
you don't want him knowing about.

14:27.878 --> 14:31.647
She was chatting up somebody
about your father pretty good.

14:35.843 --> 14:38.634
I'm not answering any more questions.

14:38.659 --> 14:41.275
If you know anything
about Sabine's murder,

14:41.367 --> 14:44.078
if you think your father was behind it,

14:44.103 --> 14:45.642
you can tell us. We can protect you.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.235
I would never be afraid of my father.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.728
Now, you guys want more answers?

14:48.760 --> 14:50.260
Come visit me in St. Petersburg.

14:50.285 --> 14:52.353
You're a suspect in a
murder investigation.

14:52.378 --> 14:54.144
You're not goin' anywhere.

14:54.169 --> 14:57.271
Well,
then you obviously don't know my father.

14:58.948 --> 15:01.274
Well, I checked with Washington,

15:01.299 --> 15:03.165
and the Russian embassy has intervened,

15:03.190 --> 15:06.322
and Viktor Comenko has arranged
to have his son sent back home.

15:06.347 --> 15:08.304
W... so that's it?

15:08.339 --> 15:09.822
Well, I'm gonna do my best to stop it.

15:09.847 --> 15:13.297
In the meantime, we have a new
medical examiner in the program.

15:13.322 --> 15:18.204
Check in, see if she found any other DNA
on Sabine's body that wasn't hers or Nic's.

15:18.229 --> 15:21.040
- Maybe the killer left some behind.
- You got it.

15:25.718 --> 15:27.693
Find anything?

15:27.718 --> 15:31.928
No bag. No phone. Just a lot of
unsettlingly green artificial grass.

15:31.953 --> 15:34.147
Hm. Well, I couldn't
find anything inside.

15:34.172 --> 15:37.327
If Sabine hid something here,
she made sure Nic couldn't find it.

15:50.833 --> 15:52.106
- Okay.
- Mm.

15:52.131 --> 15:53.130
Okay, hold on.

15:53.155 --> 15:54.267
You don't want to?

15:54.292 --> 15:57.059
No, I... I do. I do, 100%.

15:57.084 --> 16:01.363
It's just... I think this might be
some sort of reaction to the stitch.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.511
It's not.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.887
I'm just excited.

16:05.912 --> 16:08.973
Yeah. You know, th... that's...

16:08.998 --> 16:13.824
That's great, I mean...
you and me, and just...

16:14.034 --> 16:18.252
I'm your first real
emotionally-connected relationship.

16:18.277 --> 16:21.651
I... no, I'm just sayin' I...
I just think we need to figure out

16:21.676 --> 16:23.559
what that means for us.

16:23.584 --> 16:26.735
Hm. Is that what you wanted
to have dinner about tonight?

16:26.760 --> 16:30.934
Y... you wanna have the, uh, "this is
how we feel about each other" talk?

16:32.217 --> 16:33.950
Yeah.

16:33.975 --> 16:36.831
Hm. I've never had the talk.

16:36.856 --> 16:39.090
Oh, well, I have, and it's horrible.

16:39.115 --> 16:42.559
But then again, so's modern art.

16:42.584 --> 16:46.059
But even something like this is
worth a bucket of money to someone.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.971
I...

16:51.996 --> 16:54.231
It's just squares.

16:56.695 --> 16:57.994
Kirsten?

16:58.019 --> 17:00.487
What are you...

17:10.936 --> 17:12.784
Do you remember any of the unlock codes?

17:12.809 --> 17:16.448
Yeah. 1-2-3-5.

17:16.473 --> 17:17.746
Okay.

17:17.771 --> 17:18.925
Try the next one.

17:18.950 --> 17:19.738
And...

17:21.194 --> 17:24.032
Are you sure you're
remembering these correctly?

17:24.058 --> 17:26.877
I mean, you were a little
distracted during that last stitch.

17:26.903 --> 17:29.198
- Mm-hm.
- Just saying.

17:35.875 --> 17:39.664
Four incorrect attempts
and this phone bricks.

17:40.539 --> 17:42.484
Linus.

17:45.655 --> 17:48.609
Hello?

17:57.637 --> 17:59.971
- Nasty, right?
- Uh, yeah.

18:00.584 --> 18:03.385
Ejected from his car
during a high-speed chase,

18:03.410 --> 18:06.222
landed on a freeway sign
20 feet off the ground.

18:06.247 --> 18:08.847
- Ugh.
- Nice shootin', Tex.

18:08.872 --> 18:11.502
Uh, I'm looking for the M.E.?

18:11.527 --> 18:13.043
Oh, well, you found her.

18:13.068 --> 18:18.582
Amanda Weston. You must be Camille
Engelson, from the NSA, right?

18:18.996 --> 18:20.589
I hear you're snarky.

18:20.614 --> 18:22.541
Well, what does that make you?

18:22.566 --> 18:24.715
- Grumpy? Dopey?
- Doc.

18:24.740 --> 18:26.332
Did you want somethin'?

18:26.357 --> 18:29.449
I wanted to get off on
the right foot with you.

18:29.784 --> 18:32.934
Well, I already got the rundown of working
with you guys, if that's why you're here.

18:32.959 --> 18:36.354
Send you crime victims, obscure the
paperwork, stall the full autopsies

18:36.379 --> 18:38.234
until said victims are returned
in three to five days...

18:38.259 --> 18:40.608
I am actually here about a case,
Sabine Colt?

18:40.633 --> 18:44.402
We're curious if any DNA was found
on her body other than Nic Comenko's.

18:44.435 --> 18:47.919
Right. Because floating in a pool all
night isn't gonna wash away any DNA.

18:47.943 --> 18:49.886
The snark is strong with you, too.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.739
We make it look good.

18:52.528 --> 18:55.776
Uh, DNA results are not back in yet.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.104
You think you could speed 'em up?

18:57.129 --> 18:59.160
I could. But I won't.

18:59.715 --> 19:03.330
See, if I put a rush on it,
people are gonna ask why,

19:03.355 --> 19:06.934
and then I'd have to tell them
about our super-secret NSA program,

19:06.959 --> 19:09.229
and then you'd have to kill them.

19:09.254 --> 19:10.954
I guess I'll wait for your call.

19:10.989 --> 19:14.254
Oh? Well, just need your number.

19:16.611 --> 19:18.904
Sure I can't just text it to you?

19:18.929 --> 19:20.715
Where's the fun in that?

19:31.437 --> 19:33.140
So, how did it go with M.E.?

19:33.467 --> 19:37.037
Uh, she doesn't really
come off like an M.E.,

19:37.062 --> 19:39.639
she's more like a...
a biker, I don't know.

19:39.663 --> 19:41.382
"Rebel Without a Corpse."

19:41.757 --> 19:43.473
- DNA?
- Results are pending.

19:43.498 --> 19:45.725
Yes. Uh, I should have them soon,
but in the meantime,

19:45.750 --> 19:48.417
I did some digging, and I found this.

19:48.442 --> 19:51.107
Apparently, Sabine's family
made a series of bad investments

19:51.132 --> 19:53.624
over the past few
years. They are broke...

19:53.649 --> 19:55.663
But with a lifestyle to keep up.

19:55.688 --> 19:57.864
That must be the situation that
Sabine was trying to help with.

19:57.889 --> 19:59.507
She was raising cash for her family.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.051
By selling inside information
about Nic's father's company.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.560
But then it became about
more than just secrets,

20:04.585 --> 20:06.382
something she didn't
wanna be involved in.

20:06.407 --> 20:09.460
So, either she got killed for what
she did do or what she wouldn't do.

20:09.485 --> 20:13.038
She did sound pretty afraid of
whoever was on the encrypted phone.

20:13.322 --> 20:16.552
Yeah. It's locked. We
tried the three codes

20:16.577 --> 20:18.327
Sabine used in the
stitch. They didn't work.

20:18.352 --> 20:21.486
Next failed attempt, and all of the
data, including her call history,

20:21.511 --> 20:24.350
gets wiped, so we thought maybe
Linus could work his magic on it.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.647
Yeah, I'll work my magic
first thing in the morn...

20:26.672 --> 20:28.132
No. Tonight.

20:28.283 --> 20:29.974
But I've got someplace that I wanted...

20:29.999 --> 20:32.933
Tonight. That leaves the messenger bag.

20:32.958 --> 20:34.741
There wasn't anything at Nic's house.

20:34.766 --> 20:39.975
I saw Sabine find it in a field.
Um... there was carousel music playing?

20:40.280 --> 20:44.170
Carousels. There are 10 active
carousels in the Los Angeles area.

20:44.195 --> 20:46.218
- Two of them are in shopping malls,
- Not them.

20:46.242 --> 20:49.108
- One at the Santa Monica pier,
- Oh, got bad memories of that one.

20:49.133 --> 20:51.609
- It wasn't that one, either.
- There are carousels at Disneyland

20:51.634 --> 20:53.217
and Knott's Berry Farm.

20:53.242 --> 20:55.233
What? I like carousels.

20:55.258 --> 20:57.225
Please, let it be Disneyland.

20:57.250 --> 21:01.546
No, it wasn't either of those.
Um... I heard a screeching noise?

21:01.571 --> 21:03.343
- Mechanical?
- Animal.

21:03.368 --> 21:06.757
Did it sound like this?

21:06.782 --> 21:09.407
- Ow. Yes.
- Well, that would happen

21:09.432 --> 21:12.007
to be the love cry of
the <i>Pavo Cristatus,</i>

21:12.032 --> 21:14.341
AKA the peacock. Two of which are housed

21:14.366 --> 21:18.234
adjacent to the Tom Mankiewicz
Conservation Carousel at the LA Zoo.

21:18.259 --> 21:20.023
- That's Griffith Park.
- Okay, check it out.

21:20.048 --> 21:22.066
- Yeah, first thing in the morning...
- No, tonight.

21:22.091 --> 21:23.617
- But we were going to...
- Going to...?

21:23.642 --> 21:25.742
- The zoo.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

21:27.321 --> 21:30.222
Uh, it's Am... it's
Amanda... It's the M.E.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.086
- Take it.
- Y... mm.

21:32.111 --> 21:34.070
Don't screw that up.

21:34.095 --> 21:35.828
Griffith Park.

21:40.079 --> 21:42.046
- Hello.
- Hi, Snarky.

21:42.081 --> 21:43.555
I got your DNA results.

21:43.580 --> 21:45.430
- Tell me.
- Not over the phone.

21:45.455 --> 21:46.604
We're on a secure line.

21:46.629 --> 21:48.625
Not over the phone.

21:48.650 --> 21:52.297
Meet me. Tonight, 9:00 p.m.

21:52.322 --> 21:54.125
I'll text you the address. And, Camille?

21:54.150 --> 21:56.032
Don't be late.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.390
Hey. Perfect timing.

22:04.415 --> 22:06.132
I'm almost finished, but, dinner?

22:06.157 --> 22:09.618
About that. Rain check?
Something came up at the lab.

22:09.643 --> 22:11.243
- Mm.
- I've got a code to crack.

22:11.268 --> 22:13.696
I love me a good code. What is it?

22:15.667 --> 22:20.956
Oh. I'm sorry. Um, none of my business.

22:20.981 --> 22:25.272
Uh, it's just pattern recognition
is kinda my super power.

22:25.297 --> 22:28.077
But, uh... I almost forgot...

22:28.102 --> 22:30.679
Daniel Stinger's daughter.

22:32.686 --> 22:35.045
Maybe this is a bad idea.

22:38.485 --> 22:40.943
The unlock code is four digits.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.522
We've got four attempts, we've
already burned through three of 'em.

22:43.547 --> 22:46.662
One more and the data fries.

22:57.420 --> 22:59.468
That's 10 digits.

22:59.493 --> 23:02.898
Uh, that's the number for Korean
barbecue. It's right down the street.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.202
They deliver. Let's get crackin'.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.027
I'm not the, uh, only
one who's been acting

23:08.052 --> 23:11.786
differently lately. You have been
very jumpy, even by your standards.

23:11.811 --> 23:13.130
What are you talkin' about?

23:13.155 --> 23:16.702
I'm not bein' jumpy.
I'm just concerned, you know?

23:16.727 --> 23:19.595
There's just something's goin'
on with you that I don't understand.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.317
So I hear.

23:21.343 --> 23:24.278
Like, why did you think
you heard something

23:24.303 --> 23:26.215
I didn't say in that stitch, and...

23:26.240 --> 23:30.052
what... why was that stitch today foggy?

23:30.077 --> 23:32.630
I don't know.
You know, and about what I heard,

23:32.655 --> 23:35.630
just forget about it. Maybe...
maybe I'm not remembering right.

23:35.655 --> 23:37.310
Then again, maybe you are, you know.

23:37.335 --> 23:39.035
I'm just trying to be a good scientist.

23:39.060 --> 23:42.739
Good scientist... or worried boyfriend?

23:42.764 --> 23:44.427
Why can't I be both?

23:45.348 --> 23:48.574
Let's just talk about this over at...
the rocks.

23:48.599 --> 23:51.833
She threw it in there.

23:53.041 --> 23:57.380
The messenger bag is behind the rocks.

23:57.992 --> 24:01.153
What? There?

24:01.203 --> 24:04.707
No. No, no. No, with all the...
the bugs and the snake and the mud

24:04.732 --> 24:06.240
and the things and the...
What are you gonna do,

24:06.265 --> 24:07.546
crawl in there and search for it?

24:07.587 --> 24:11.421
- Yep.
- Two words: dinner reservations.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.476
One word: Maggie.

24:15.711 --> 24:18.245
♪ You do it to me ♪

24:18.270 --> 24:23.334

24:23.359 --> 24:25.732

24:51.291 --> 24:52.668
Hey, you made it!

24:52.693 --> 24:55.112
I didn't know you
spin... Spun... deejayed.

24:55.137 --> 24:56.395
Whatever the hell you call it.

24:56.420 --> 24:57.285
How would you?

24:57.310 --> 25:01.691
- Uhh...
- Oh. Right. NSA. Yeah.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.374
Uh, oh god. The whole reason I'm here.
DNA results.

25:05.399 --> 25:08.340
Oh. Only Nic and Sabine's
DNA were found on her body.

25:09.146 --> 25:11.079
You fully could've told
me that on the phone.

25:11.104 --> 25:14.431
I know, but then you wouldn't be
here drinking whiskey with me.

25:14.455 --> 25:17.231
♪ Whoa, you do it to me ♪

25:18.068 --> 25:20.035
It's, polynumeric?

25:20.149 --> 25:22.457
Well, there's no letter
substitution that tracks.

25:22.482 --> 25:24.376
Steganographic?

25:24.401 --> 25:26.684
Not unless it's hiding in plain sight.

25:28.421 --> 25:30.684
It is a rolling cipher!

25:31.609 --> 25:34.043
Okay. So...

25:34.068 --> 25:38.770
one plus two is three, plus three is six,
plus five is 11, one plus one is two.

25:38.795 --> 25:41.595
Multiply that by the first
number in the first sequence,

25:41.620 --> 25:42.565
it's two, and the...

25:42.590 --> 25:43.942
Take two, multiply it
by the second number

25:43.967 --> 25:46.043
in the first sequence, that's four!

25:46.068 --> 25:47.105
It works!

25:47.453 --> 25:48.667
- Okay.
- So...

25:48.691 --> 25:53.083
Two, four, six, three!

25:56.256 --> 25:58.237
Are... are... Are you sure?

25:58.262 --> 25:59.512
Positive.

25:59.537 --> 26:01.223
But, if you don't trust me, I...

26:01.248 --> 26:04.449
N... no, no. Go for it.

26:14.269 --> 26:16.202
- Ha! We did it!
- You did it!

26:16.227 --> 26:18.010
You really have a super power!

26:18.035 --> 26:21.041
Okay, this is the last
number she dialed.

26:21.219 --> 26:22.886
Right.

26:36.472 --> 26:38.783
I appreciate the NSA's
dry cleaning policy.

26:38.808 --> 26:43.148
You know, there'd better be a
good reason I'm here right now.

26:43.173 --> 26:45.611
Oh, have you been drinking?

26:45.636 --> 26:47.814
I went to a club.

26:47.839 --> 26:48.894
Any DNA?

26:48.919 --> 26:53.776
Mm. Well.
Lots of DNA being swapped at the club.

26:53.801 --> 26:58.036
Negative. Only Nic's and Sabine's.

26:58.061 --> 26:59.580
What were you doing at a club?

26:59.605 --> 27:04.462
No one. Nothing. Oh my god.
Can a girl go to a club by herself?

27:04.487 --> 27:07.807
- What am I looking at? Where were you?
- Uh, in the mud

27:07.832 --> 27:10.800
with the bugs and the snakes and the...
who knows what else.

27:11.795 --> 27:14.549
This better be good.
I was in the middle of oysters

27:14.574 --> 27:15.393
with Stephanie.

27:15.418 --> 27:17.345
Ugh, TMI, Fisher.

27:17.370 --> 27:18.815
Hey, sometimes oysters is oysters.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.549
What's inside of the bag?

27:24.074 --> 27:26.658
That's a lotta coke.

27:26.683 --> 27:30.652
It wasn't a squared Fibonacci or
a descending harmonic reverse.

27:30.677 --> 27:31.986
Just simple rolling cipher.

27:32.011 --> 27:33.524
Way to go, man of science.

27:33.549 --> 27:35.542
Actually, it was a woman of science.

27:35.567 --> 27:36.911
Ivy figured it out.

27:36.936 --> 27:37.944
Ivy?

27:37.969 --> 27:40.335
This is a highly-classified
NSA investigation...

27:40.360 --> 27:44.006
That Ivy helped us with.
You're wrong about her.

27:44.031 --> 27:48.194
I didn't tell her any details of the
case. She just helped me with the code.

27:48.744 --> 27:52.788
Sabine used this phone to
call this single number.

27:53.869 --> 27:56.704
Oh, this is why I'm here.

27:56.729 --> 28:01.280
So seriously, no one else knows
how to use a tablet? Okay.

28:01.916 --> 28:05.225
Looks like it's a New York number

28:05.250 --> 28:07.686
registered to a Jack Dalliford,

28:07.711 --> 28:13.268
who... just turned up dead behind a
Manhattan pizzeria on Bleecker Street.

28:13.293 --> 28:16.538
I will get his body sent right over.

28:16.563 --> 28:19.445
Well... cheers.

28:26.859 --> 28:30.430
Uhh, thank god you're here.
What did you bring me for breakfast?

28:30.455 --> 28:32.121
I thought you needed a ride to work.

28:32.535 --> 28:35.030
Those are not mutually
exclusive concepts.

28:35.055 --> 28:37.609
I'll go see what's in the fridge.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.676
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

28:39.701 --> 28:41.668
Thank you so much.

28:45.087 --> 28:47.921
- This better be work-related.
- Totally.

28:47.946 --> 28:51.218
Meet me at the Lowdown for the lowdown.
Tonight.

28:51.243 --> 28:52.727
I'm not falling for that again.

28:52.752 --> 28:55.573
Come on. I'm spinning again.

28:55.598 --> 28:57.164
Ahhh...

28:59.609 --> 29:03.477
Hey. No sweat. I'm prolific, baby.

29:03.502 --> 29:06.102
Creep my Instagram tonight.
See what you missed.

29:07.722 --> 29:11.031
I... I gotta go. Okay.

29:11.056 --> 29:14.270
Did I hear the sounds of
telephonic flirtation?

29:14.295 --> 29:16.695
What? No! Just work.

29:17.601 --> 29:20.695
- You met someone.
- No!

29:21.493 --> 29:24.727
Maybe. Whatever. I don't know.

29:25.005 --> 29:29.742
I hope you have. You're amazing, so
you deserve someone equally as awesome.

29:29.919 --> 29:32.453
Thank you. So do you.

29:33.479 --> 29:35.960
Call him back. What do you have to lose?

29:35.985 --> 29:38.757
I don't know.
Takes me a minute to trust people.

29:38.782 --> 29:41.929
Everyone deserves to be
trusted until proven otherwise.

29:42.511 --> 29:44.773
That sounds like a horrible policy.

29:44.798 --> 29:47.665
It is... unless it isn't.

29:54.382 --> 29:55.921
- Doctor?
- Doctor.

29:55.946 --> 29:57.846
Hey, we plugged the hole
on being hacked, yes?

29:57.871 --> 29:59.726
- Yes, totally.
- Totally-totally, or...?

29:59.751 --> 30:01.352
Completely totally. What's up?

30:01.377 --> 30:03.381
Kirsten heard me say
something to her in the stitch

30:03.406 --> 30:04.793
which I never said.

30:04.818 --> 30:06.358
Glitch or faulty memory?

30:06.383 --> 30:08.117
- Outside force?
- I don't think so,

30:08.142 --> 30:09.812
but I'll keep an eye on
it during the next stitch.

30:09.837 --> 30:11.804
- Thanks. Doctor.
- Doctor.

30:16.844 --> 30:20.260
- Where you at, K-Max?
- Uh, on the street.

30:20.285 --> 30:21.450
In New York, I think.

30:21.475 --> 30:23.754
How's the weather?
Stitchy with a chance of fog?

30:23.779 --> 30:25.779
Nope. Clear at the moment.

30:29.273 --> 30:31.239
What did you find out?

30:31.275 --> 30:32.387
His father got the contract.

30:32.412 --> 30:34.345
I'll be in touch. I'll be in touch.

30:34.370 --> 30:36.629
I'll be in touch.

30:43.205 --> 30:47.192
Buy Novogorsk Steel,
as many shares as you can.

30:47.217 --> 30:48.848
Sabine called Dalliford,

30:48.873 --> 30:51.784
told him about the steel contract,
then he called someone else

30:51.809 --> 30:54.871
and told them to buy
shares of Novogorsk Steel.

30:54.896 --> 30:57.268
Dalliford was running
an insider-trading scam.

30:57.293 --> 30:58.730
It would seem so.

30:58.755 --> 31:00.518
Wait, I'm being pulled
into another memory.

31:00.543 --> 31:03.988
I'm in a room. I see Dalliford.

31:04.298 --> 31:07.332
- Please stop.
- He's beat up, tied to a chair.

31:07.357 --> 31:08.457
Please stop.

31:15.341 --> 31:19.745
Well? Novogorsk Steel.

31:19.773 --> 31:21.925
You knew to buy shares. How?

31:22.228 --> 31:25.196
Someone's wailing on him pretty hard.

31:25.448 --> 31:26.785
Ooh!

31:26.810 --> 31:28.172
They wanna know how he knew

31:28.197 --> 31:29.229
about the steel contract.

31:29.254 --> 31:31.214
- Can you see the guy?
- Yeah.

31:31.239 --> 31:33.886
Bulldog-looking thug.
I've... I've never seen him before.

31:33.911 --> 31:34.977
Comenko's son.

31:36.989 --> 31:39.863
He... has a girlfriend.

31:40.791 --> 31:44.574
- She's been feeding me information.
- So you're using a girl

31:44.599 --> 31:47.644
to get information from Comenko's son?

31:47.669 --> 31:49.613
I'm gonna need her to
do something for me.

31:49.638 --> 31:51.505
You told me you can control her.

31:51.530 --> 31:55.847
Bulldog wants Dalliford to get
Sabine to do something for him.

31:55.872 --> 31:59.113
She won't do it. She says that planting
drugs on him wasn't part of the deal.

31:59.138 --> 32:01.964
She'll have to be helpful
in some other way...

32:01.989 --> 32:03.604
Helpful in some other way.

32:03.629 --> 32:04.863
Death memory in four seconds.

32:04.888 --> 32:06.544
Get the hell outta there, Kirsten.
Make the bounce.

32:06.569 --> 32:09.644
No! No!

32:12.810 --> 32:15.844
Sabine was killed because she
wouldn't plant the drugs on Nic.

32:15.869 --> 32:18.902
- To shut her up?
- I don't think so.

32:18.927 --> 32:21.828
What would planting
drugs on Nic accomplish?

32:21.853 --> 32:24.335
It would've gotten him
detained, questioned.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.183
Yeah, but killing Sabine and
making him a person of interest

32:27.208 --> 32:28.644
in the murder did that, too.

32:28.669 --> 32:31.339
But is that all Bulldog wanted,
just to get Nic detained?

32:31.364 --> 32:33.277
What does getting Nic
detained buy someone?

32:33.302 --> 32:34.746
Opportunity.

32:34.771 --> 32:38.453
Think about it. What would paranoid,
afraid-to-leave-Russia-for-fear-

32:38.478 --> 32:40.645
of-being-assassinated Viktor Comenko do

32:40.670 --> 32:43.263
if the son he was devoted
to was in trouble in LA?

32:43.288 --> 32:45.217
He'd come himself to rescue his son.

32:45.242 --> 32:47.076
Which is I'm guessing is
exactly what he's doing.

32:47.101 --> 32:49.310
Now, Comenko can't travel
with his armed detail,

32:49.335 --> 32:51.654
so he's more vulnerable in the
states than he was in Russia.

32:51.679 --> 32:56.989
Killing Sabine was the bait in
a plot to kill Viktor Comenko.

32:57.014 --> 33:02.614
And that, my friends,
is how the Russian nesting dolls unnest.

33:02.639 --> 33:06.591
Okay, we need to find Nic and his
father before they both end up dead.

33:07.856 --> 33:11.254
None of Comenko's jets have left
Russia in the past 72 hours.

33:11.279 --> 33:12.658
Yeah. Wanna know why?

33:12.683 --> 33:14.583
So I said to myself, "If I'm Comenko",

33:14.608 --> 33:17.872
"I'd probably have a whack of false
papers to use if I need to blow town

33:17.897 --> 33:19.802
should Moscow get a
hate-on for me, right?"

33:19.827 --> 33:22.974
So I ran Comenko's photos through the
Interpol passport registry and got a hit

33:22.999 --> 33:25.655
on three different aliases.
I ran those aliases

33:25.680 --> 33:28.075
through the Department of Homeland
Security airline booking database,

33:28.100 --> 33:31.130
and discovered the tickets were
issued to one of those aliases.

33:31.155 --> 33:33.692
Nicolai and Mikael Karlaff.

33:33.717 --> 33:36.380
- Karlaff?
- Flight 1815.

33:36.405 --> 33:38.755
The Comenkos are traveling
under that particular alias.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.442
They're probably on
their way to LAX now.

33:40.467 --> 33:43.894
Okay, I'll call TSA, have them hold
the Comenkos until Fisher can put them

33:43.919 --> 33:45.489
in protective custody.

33:46.267 --> 33:49.419
Camille... good work.

33:53.278 --> 33:55.849
Hey. Fisher's going to LAX.

33:55.874 --> 33:59.958
I found a couple plane tickets for
Nic and Viktor under assumed names.

34:02.419 --> 34:04.833
Viktor Comenko wouldn't fly commercial.

34:04.858 --> 34:07.458
He'd be completely exposed.

34:08.518 --> 34:11.833
Okay... think. What would you do

34:11.858 --> 34:13.855
if you were a Russian steel tycoon,

34:13.880 --> 34:16.981
and you went someplace you
couldn't take your private militia?

34:17.018 --> 34:18.935
I'd hire the best I could locally.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.960
So, we need to get into
Russian banking records

34:20.985 --> 34:22.797
and see if he's hired
any LA-based security.

34:22.822 --> 34:24.156
How hard could that be?

34:24.190 --> 34:27.864
With enough time it's not hard,
but we don't have enough time.

34:28.069 --> 34:30.130
I'll be back.

34:35.494 --> 34:38.875
Fisher called. The tickets were
a smokescreen. Comenko wanted us

34:38.900 --> 34:40.733
looking at LAX.

34:42.656 --> 34:44.493
You gotta be frickin' kiddin' me.

34:44.518 --> 34:47.049
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- We need her expertise.

34:47.074 --> 34:48.306
Ivy worked in banking for years.

34:48.331 --> 34:49.330
She knows how to navigate

34:49.355 --> 34:51.174
the international banking system.

34:51.199 --> 34:53.893
It's not like she hasn't seen
the inside of the lab before.

34:53.918 --> 34:56.552
Cameron, what do you think?

34:56.580 --> 34:59.705
If I'm being totally honest,
I don't think it's a good idea.

34:59.730 --> 35:02.354
Camille, what about you?

35:02.379 --> 35:07.487
Um... everyone deserves to be trusted

35:07.512 --> 35:09.278
until proven otherwise?

35:13.535 --> 35:17.412
Find Comenko, let's get it done.

35:35.756 --> 35:37.656
Got it.

35:37.681 --> 35:42.125
It looks like Comenko's hired Seraph
Private Security on a few occasions

35:42.150 --> 35:44.095
over the years when he's
come to Los Angeles.

35:44.120 --> 35:48.392
Well, these guys are no joke.
Mercs. And looky here.

35:48.417 --> 35:51.198
They've got a full
security detail dispatched

35:51.223 --> 35:54.134
into a private hangar at the Santa
Monica airport in 20 minutes,

35:54.159 --> 35:55.664
leaving from Seraph's headquarters.

35:55.689 --> 35:57.259
Where's Seraph's headquarters?

35:57.284 --> 35:58.845
Broadway. Downtown LA.

35:58.870 --> 36:00.828
Bet you a bitcoin the
Comenkos are there now

36:00.853 --> 36:02.095
waiting to be taken to their plane.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.649
I agree. Call Fisher.

36:03.674 --> 36:07.704
Thank you, Ivy. Now
it's time for you to go.

36:25.881 --> 36:28.523
Hold it! NSA! Drop your weapons!

36:28.548 --> 36:32.173
Nic and Viktor Comenko, we need you to
come with us. You are being detained.

36:32.198 --> 36:35.357
Technically, I'm not even here.
My son and I are going to the airport

36:35.382 --> 36:38.673
- and leaving America now.
- We believe your life is in danger.

36:38.698 --> 36:42.252
Sweetie, tell me something I don't know.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.752
That's Bulldog!

36:45.788 --> 36:47.305
Watch out, Nic!

36:47.330 --> 36:48.728
Kirsten, get down!

36:52.703 --> 36:55.189
Target down!

36:55.799 --> 36:58.874
- Clear!
- Fisher, cuff him!

37:06.859 --> 37:08.526
How'd you guys know to come here?

37:08.551 --> 37:09.867
Sabine showed me the way.

37:17.117 --> 37:20.204
Viktor Comenko was
targeted by a competitor

37:20.229 --> 37:23.497
in the Russian steel business who
lost out on the military contract.

37:23.533 --> 37:27.232
He thought killing Comenko
would reopen negotiations.

37:27.257 --> 37:29.075
How's Comenko doing?

37:29.100 --> 37:31.497
Stable, and actually
grateful for our help.

37:31.522 --> 37:33.904
Nothin' like a bullet
to soften a guy up.

37:33.929 --> 37:35.818
So, Ivy came through for us again, huh?

37:35.843 --> 37:38.086
I understand that we
are split about her,

37:38.111 --> 37:39.911
but until we know where
her loyalties are,

37:39.936 --> 37:42.896
we have to protect
ourselves, understood?

37:43.805 --> 37:46.059
New business. Thanks to Kirsten,

37:46.084 --> 37:47.997
I will be taking on Blair's duties,

37:48.022 --> 37:50.531
which means that I will be
in Washington occasionally.

37:50.556 --> 37:53.029
Making the NSA great again? Nice.

37:53.054 --> 37:56.952
Which means I need to appoint someone
to take on my responsibilities

37:56.977 --> 37:59.389
in the lab when I'm not here.

37:59.414 --> 38:04.967
Now, I have put a lot of thought
into this, and the only person

38:04.992 --> 38:08.380
that the only person that I think
is capable of doing the job...

38:08.405 --> 38:09.826
is Cameron.

38:09.851 --> 38:12.787
Maggie, nah, come on, I'm more of a...
kinda guy.

38:12.812 --> 38:15.763
You'll be great.
I'll brief you before I leave.

38:15.788 --> 38:20.177
So excited.

38:23.916 --> 38:26.122
Uh, you got a minute?

38:26.147 --> 38:27.740
Sure.

38:33.435 --> 38:35.138
Why Cameron?

38:35.163 --> 38:37.096
You mean why not you?

38:38.788 --> 38:42.071
Whoever runs this place,
their first job...

38:42.096 --> 38:44.763
is to protect the team.

38:44.788 --> 38:48.685
"Everyone deserves to be
trusted until proven otherwise"?

38:48.710 --> 38:50.857
That is a bad policy

38:50.882 --> 38:54.068
in our business, and
can get people killed.

38:54.481 --> 38:58.309
- I made a mistake.
- Yes. You did.

39:03.874 --> 39:06.590
Okay.

39:13.302 --> 39:15.906
Look at you, big boss man.

39:15.931 --> 39:18.432
Yeah, I have a feeling this isn't
gonna be one of those fun promotions.

39:18.457 --> 39:22.867
Oh, well, as long as you don't abuse your
authority and start ordering tests on me.

39:22.892 --> 39:29.234
Kirsten... everything I do is
because I care about you. Deeply.

39:29.259 --> 39:32.491
I need to know why you think you
heard what you heard in that stitch.

39:32.516 --> 39:35.164
I need to know that
stitching is safe for you.

39:35.189 --> 39:37.274
I need you to trust me.

39:37.981 --> 39:39.781
I do trust you.

39:39.806 --> 39:42.274
I wanna believe that. I really do.

39:42.579 --> 39:44.106
But you're not sure.

39:44.131 --> 39:45.931
Let's just talk about it at dinner.

39:45.956 --> 39:48.056
Oh, right, when we have "the talk."

39:48.081 --> 39:49.881
Yeah.

39:51.930 --> 39:54.333
I... I have a better idea.
