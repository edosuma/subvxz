00:03.537 --> 00:05.137
Hey, louis, check it out.

00:05.139 --> 00:08.340
This app will help you learn
how to speak mandarin chinese.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.342
Are you sending me to china?

00:10.344 --> 00:12.611
No, I'd never do that.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.813
He sent his kid to japan.

00:14.815 --> 00:15.814
Oh, no, no.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.616
The-the army sent him to japan.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.685
You're sending me to the army?

00:19.687 --> 00:21.120
No, no, n-no.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.287
We're not sending you anywhere.

00:22.289 --> 00:23.889
We-we just want
to help you learn.

00:23.891 --> 00:24.990
So, check it out.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.192
You can type in any phrase,

00:27.194 --> 00:30.129
And the app will say it for you.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.832
(woman speaking
mandarin chinese)

00:33.834 --> 00:35.067
Ooh, what'd she say?

00:35.069 --> 00:36.068
She sounds pretty.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.569
She said,
"alan, your fly is open."

00:37.571 --> 00:39.004
Oh. Oh!

00:39.006 --> 00:41.173
(chuckles) uh, well, how do you
tell her, "thank you"?

00:41.175 --> 00:43.242
Uh, let's find out.

00:44.177 --> 00:46.078
<i>Xiexie.</i>

00:46.080 --> 00:49.715
That's gonna blow their minds
down at the panda express.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.418
Extra orange chicken, <i>xiexie.</i>

00:52.420 --> 00:55.220
Walden, I-I'm chinese elvis.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.855
<i>Xiexie. Xiexie,</i> very much.

00:56.857 --> 00:57.856
(chuckles)

00:57.858 --> 00:59.058
All right.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.060
Let's put on these headphones,

01:01.062 --> 01:04.329
And we'll learn
a little chinese, huh?

01:04.331 --> 01:06.698
So, um, listen,
g-going forward,

01:06.700 --> 01:09.435
Um, how are we gonna do
this whole co-parenting thing?

01:09.437 --> 01:10.702
What do you mean?

01:10.704 --> 01:12.671
Well, when you were gonna
adopt a baby,

01:12.673 --> 01:14.506
We were gonna get
a divorce right after.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.342
But now, if we become
louis's foster parents,

01:17.344 --> 01:19.745
We're gonna have to be together
for a minimum of six months.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.946
Uh, not that I'm complaining.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.748
This is the happiest
and most loving of any

01:22.750 --> 01:24.683
Of my three marriages.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.118
I'm thinking it would
just be the opposite

01:26.120 --> 01:27.419
Of when jake was here.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.188
You were the dad, and
I occasionally imparted wisdom,

01:29.190 --> 01:31.957
Like... The skull
and crossbones on a bottle

01:31.959 --> 01:34.426
Underneath the sink doesn't mean
that it's pirate juice.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.029
Okay, well, uh, uh,

01:37.031 --> 01:39.031
Then I will follow
your lead with louis.

01:39.033 --> 01:41.867
I will be the second
in command, the-the copilot,

01:41.869 --> 01:45.204
The, uh, the, uh,
the lieutenant, if you will.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.605
I won't.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.641
This is hard.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.143
Oh, all right,
let me help you out here.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.778
Type in a phrase.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.146
Anything you want to say.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.116
Okay.

01:57.118 --> 02:00.185
"I... Want to quit."

02:02.122 --> 02:04.056
Okay, uh...

02:05.258 --> 02:07.326
(speaks mandarin chinese)

02:09.230 --> 02:11.964
If you're trying to say,
"I want to quit,"

02:11.966 --> 02:14.433
It's pronounced...
(speaks mandarin chinese)

02:14.435 --> 02:17.469
What you asked for is
a lap dance.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.671
Oh, my god, I'm sorry.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.240
It's okay, I wasn't offended.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.642
Oh, well, in that case...

02:23.644 --> 02:25.177
(repeats mispronunciation)

02:25.179 --> 02:27.079
(laughs)

02:27.081 --> 02:28.080
I'm jean.

02:28.082 --> 02:29.214
I'm walden.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.251
Oh, and, uh, this is
louis and alan.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.086
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

02:34.088 --> 02:36.455
So, you're teaching louis
mandarin?

02:36.457 --> 02:39.324
Well, I bought him, uh,
an app for 99 cents,

02:39.326 --> 02:41.927
So, yeah, I'm teaching him.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.196
(laughs)

02:44.198 --> 02:47.599
Well, I speak fluent mandarin,
so if you need any help

02:47.601 --> 02:50.669
With anything...

02:50.671 --> 02:52.171
Give me a call.

02:52.173 --> 02:55.140
Ah, well, I could always use
a helping hand.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.208
(chuckles)

02:58.144 --> 03:01.146
(speaking mandarin chinese)

03:01.148 --> 03:03.782
Oh. Oh!

03:06.119 --> 03:08.187
Nice meeting you.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.890
What happened?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.692
What did you say?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.994
He said,
"they're married."

03:15.996 --> 03:19.131
And if he hadn't,
I was about to.

03:19.133 --> 03:22.201
â™ª men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men â™ª

03:22.203 --> 03:24.970
â™ª ah.
â™ª men.
â™ª men.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.976
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

03:30.978 --> 03:32.144
How's it going
out there?

03:32.146 --> 03:33.979
I don't know. I'm trying
to read their lips.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.681
He either said, "I
really like it here,"

03:35.683 --> 03:37.649
Or "I'd really
like a beer."

03:39.152 --> 03:40.352
I-I'm sure
he's saying good things.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.154
You know, how-how you're
teaching him chinese,

03:42.156 --> 03:45.157
How I'm teaching him
environmental awareness.

03:45.159 --> 03:47.426
You taught him to pee in
the shower to save water.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.429
And you know what
our mother earth says to that?

03:50.431 --> 03:52.164
Xiexie.

03:53.433 --> 03:57.236
I got to tell you, I've already
grown attached to this kid.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.271
And if she does try
to take him away,

03:59.273 --> 04:01.506
I know a guy
who can get him back.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.275
You're kidding, right?

04:03.277 --> 04:05.444
Right, kidding.

04:05.446 --> 04:09.448
But if I find an envelope in my
car with, say, two grand in it,

04:09.450 --> 04:11.984
I have no way of knowing
where it came from.

04:13.386 --> 04:14.419
Can I talk to you guys
for a second?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.388
Uh, yeah, sure.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.889
Uh, berta, could
you watch louis?

04:17.891 --> 04:19.291
Absolutely.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.293
We'll be in the car
with the engine running.

04:24.364 --> 04:27.099
So, I talked to louis
about his weekend here.

04:27.101 --> 04:30.068
Uh, did he answer you
in english or mandarin?

04:30.070 --> 04:31.436
English.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.472
Though I'm very impressed
you're teaching him chinese.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.307
And to pee in the shower.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.276
That's mine.

04:37.278 --> 04:41.213
I'm also teaching him to dance
like no one is watching.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.784
Well, he seems to have
settled in nicely.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.086
He feels very happy
and safe with you guys,

04:48.088 --> 04:50.389
So I see no reason
why I shouldn't approve you

04:50.391 --> 04:51.790
To be louis's foster parents.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.091
Really?
Are you serious?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.660
I rarely lie about these things.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.095
I did it once,
and it did not go well.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.164
This-this is great!

04:59.166 --> 05:02.401
I-I know. I-I've never been
approved for anything, ever.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.403
Bite me, discover card.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.305
Congratulations!
Thank you!

05:06.307 --> 05:08.307
This is my favorite part
of the job.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.175
Well, that and doughnut Friday.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.311
Oh, god, my life is empty.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.012
Oh, wait, d-does
louis know?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.014
No, he thinks I'm happy.

05:17.283 --> 05:20.485
Oh, you mean about him here.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.120
Uh, no, you should tell him.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.289
But before you do,
just remember,

05:24.291 --> 05:27.292
Kids who've been in the foster
system as long as he has can be

05:27.294 --> 05:29.161
A little withdrawn
or manipulative,

05:29.163 --> 05:31.029
So don't be surprised
if he acts out.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.265
It's okay. I was a
rebel when I was a kid.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.267
One night, I took my
mom's car for a joyride.

05:35.269 --> 05:37.269
(chuckles) the cops would
have never caught me

05:37.271 --> 05:40.339
If the library
hadn't been closed.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.673
Well, call me if
you need anything.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.875
I got to run. I got to
hit the craft store.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.813
I am making each one of my cats
a christmas stocking.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.282
I should have stopped at
"I got to run."

05:50.284 --> 05:52.384
Anyway, congratulations.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.688
Oh, hey, uh, louis,
could you come in here?

05:56.690 --> 05:59.491
Oh, my god, we should
tell him he can't stay.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.859
How funny would that be?

06:02.295 --> 06:04.596
I'll follow your lead.

06:06.399 --> 06:09.568
Hey, louis, um,

06:09.570 --> 06:11.336
So ms. Mcmartin said

06:11.338 --> 06:13.805
That you like it here
and you want to stay.

06:13.807 --> 06:14.806
I do.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.041
Well, we told her

06:16.043 --> 06:17.709
That we want you to stay,

06:17.711 --> 06:21.179
And she said... Okay!

06:21.181 --> 06:22.547
Really? Cool!

06:22.549 --> 06:24.049
Yeah. We should celebrate.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.351
Can we get pizza, zippy?

06:26.353 --> 06:28.353
(berta laughs)

06:28.355 --> 06:30.422
That turned out funnier
than I thought it would.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.326
â™ª men.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.328
You know, when my
son was your age,

06:36.330 --> 06:38.530
We used to play video
games just like this.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.866
Really?
Yes, and I used
to let him win,

06:40.868 --> 06:42.367
Just like I'm
letting you win...

06:42.369 --> 06:43.502
(cars crashing over tv)
hey!

06:43.504 --> 06:45.404
How'd you blow
up my car?!

06:45.406 --> 06:48.507
All right, louis,
time to get ready for bed.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.275
Five more minutes?

06:50.277 --> 06:51.443
No. You know the deal.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.045
One hour of video games a
night. Now it's bedtime.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.614
Aw, no fair.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.782
Well, life isn't fair.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.450
Look at my face, look at his.

06:58.452 --> 07:01.453
All right, I'm gonna go
run you a bath.

07:01.455 --> 07:04.122
Put your dishes in the sink
and put away the controllers.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.191
And, louis, you help him.

07:09.729 --> 07:13.298
Oh, I know you're upset,
but rules are important.

07:13.300 --> 07:17.469
It's just, we never got to play
video games in the group home.

07:17.471 --> 07:20.472
Oh, of course.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.541
The group home.

07:24.477 --> 07:27.379
Okay, what if we just
snuck in a few more minutes?

07:27.381 --> 07:29.581
Really?
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, but, uh...

07:29.583 --> 07:30.949
But you can't
tell walden,

07:30.951 --> 07:33.418
And we have to play
it really quietly.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.386
(quietly):
You're the coolest.

07:34.388 --> 07:36.188
(gasps)
I'm the cool dad.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.458
(whispers):
I'm the cool dad.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.396
â™ª men.

07:44.398 --> 07:45.730
Oh, hey
there, kiddo.

07:45.732 --> 07:46.598
How'd you sleep?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.500
With my eyes closed.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.569
Ah, kicking it old school.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.003
I respect that.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.438
Can I have breakfast?

07:53.440 --> 07:56.341
Sure. How about some oatmeal?

07:56.343 --> 07:57.509
Cookies!

07:57.511 --> 08:00.612
Well, do you like
oatmeal cookies?
Yes.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.414
Well, this is a sugarless
oatmeal cookie

08:02.416 --> 08:04.483
In wet, pasty form.

08:04.485 --> 08:05.917
Why can't I have cookies?

08:05.919 --> 08:07.786
Well, because
cookies aren't breakfast food.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.988
And remember what walden said
about eating healthy.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.490
Yeah, I know.

08:11.492 --> 08:15.260
My last foster family
wouldn't give me cookies either.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.862
Oh.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.366
I suppose one wouldn't hurt.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.438
Thanks.
(chuckles)

08:26.440 --> 08:28.306
Walden:
Hey, louis, are you up yet?

08:28.308 --> 08:30.308
Oh. Uh, in here!

08:30.310 --> 08:32.110
(quietly):
Eat it. Wipe your mouth.

08:33.112 --> 08:35.647
Chocolate lips sink ships.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.350
Morning. Just making louis
some oatmeal.

08:38.352 --> 08:41.052
That's good, 'cause we got
a big day for you, big guy.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.721
I got a bunch
of errands to run,

08:42.723 --> 08:45.357
But alan is gonna take you
to the store

08:45.359 --> 08:47.158
And buy you a new backpack.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.394
I saw one that looks
just like yoda.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.863
(imitates yoda):
To school you will wear it.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.465
Okay.
Hmm.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.467
What are you eating?

08:55.469 --> 08:58.670
Show it to me.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.038
Is that a cookie?

09:01.340 --> 09:03.074
Where did you get a cookie?

09:06.045 --> 09:08.947
Louis, where did you get
a cookie?

09:10.650 --> 09:13.485
Hey, uh, louis,
why don't you go get dressed

09:13.487 --> 09:15.554
And-and I'll make you
some oatmeal,

09:15.556 --> 09:17.222
And then you can get going.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.256
Okay.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.591
Oh, and-and
don't forget

09:19.593 --> 09:20.859
To brush your teeth.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.594
And-and wash your hands.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.663
Oh, and put on clean underwear.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.730
Clean underwear?

09:25.732 --> 09:28.199
We're going to target,
not the white house.

09:28.201 --> 09:31.369
Why would you give him a cookie
for breakfast?

09:31.371 --> 09:34.706
I couldn't help it.
He gave me orphan face.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.841
(cockney accent): Please, sir,
can I have a cookie?

09:36.843 --> 09:39.844
Me tum-tum is all empty
and growly.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.213
When it comes to louis,
we have to be a team.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.616
If I make a rule,
you got to have my back.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.551
You're right, you're right,
and-and from now on,

09:46.553 --> 09:48.853
I will ignore him
like I ignore all those calls

09:48.855 --> 09:50.188
From the collection agency.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.557
Great. Okay, now, please,

09:52.559 --> 09:54.559
Today, just take him
to the store,

09:54.561 --> 09:56.561
Get him a backpack,
and then bring him home.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.963
I want to do
something fun later.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.632
A hint: Has to do
with miniature golf

10:00.634 --> 10:03.568
And it rhymes with "what-what."

10:03.570 --> 10:04.903
That sounds great.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.638
I'll, uh, take him out
right after breakfast.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.707
And while you're out,
get some more of these cookies.

10:08.709 --> 10:12.444
(cockney accent): They make me
tum-tum all smiley, governor.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.713
See, I can do accents.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.715
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

10:16.717 --> 10:20.418
Okay. Okay, here's the
fun part. Wait. Wait.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.754
â™ª domo arigato, mr. Roboto

10:22.756 --> 10:24.889
â™ª domo
â™ª domo

10:24.891 --> 10:26.825
â™ª domo
â™ª domo

10:26.827 --> 10:30.095
â™ª domo arigato,
mr. Roboto â™ª

10:30.097 --> 10:31.763
â™ª domo
â™ª domo

10:31.765 --> 10:33.398
â™ª domo.
â™ª domo.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.599
(music continues)

10:34.601 --> 10:37.068
I like that song.
It's about robots.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.771
Yup. If you have to have one
cassette stuck in your dash,

10:39.773 --> 10:41.239
Make it styx.

10:41.241 --> 10:44.242
Look, laser tag! Can we go?

10:44.244 --> 10:45.744
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.913
We're just gonna go buy
a backpack and go straight home.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.081
Please?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.484
Oh, no, do not
give me that face.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.818
It is not gonna work.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.820
I thought you were cool.

10:57.123 --> 11:00.959
Well... I suppose one game
of laser tag couldn't hurt.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.160
Awesome!

11:02.162 --> 11:03.695
But it has to be a...

11:03.697 --> 11:05.463
(turns up music)

11:05.465 --> 11:06.498
â™ª secret, secret

11:06.500 --> 11:08.566
Both:
â™ª I got a secret...

11:09.802 --> 11:10.802
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:10.804 --> 11:13.371
(kids laughing, lasers firing)

11:17.610 --> 11:19.044
(laughs)

11:19.046 --> 11:22.213
Go tell your mommies
you got shot by cooldad47.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.218
Hey, hey, who hit me?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.621
I got you.
Oh. I'm gonna get you.

11:29.623 --> 11:30.622
I'm gonna get you.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.390
Yeah, yeah, you better run.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.658
Better run faster.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.226
(thump)
louis: Ow, my head!

11:35.228 --> 11:36.461
Louis?

11:36.463 --> 11:37.629
Louis, are you okay?

11:37.631 --> 11:38.963
Hey, whoa, whoa!

11:38.965 --> 11:40.899
Wait, wait, don't shoot!
Uh, my kid is hurt.

11:43.803 --> 11:44.636
Ha, ha. Sucker.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.404
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:50.810 --> 11:52.744
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:52.746 --> 11:54.813
Hey. I got here
as quick as I could.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.214
Are you okay, buddy?
What happened?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.849
He's fine. It's typical
kid stuff, you know?

11:57.851 --> 11:59.317
He was running
a little too fast,

11:59.319 --> 12:00.719
And he tripped
and bumped his head.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.754
And then alan
shot a little girl.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.659
What?
We played laser tag.

12:07.661 --> 12:09.027
â™ª secret, secret

12:09.029 --> 12:10.595
â™ª it was a secret.

12:12.531 --> 12:15.567
Alan, can I talk to you
in the hallway?

12:15.569 --> 12:17.736
Ooh, you're in trouble.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.280
I really hope you have
a good explanation

12:29.282 --> 12:30.882
For taking him to laser tag.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.618
Uh, okay, j-just
out of curiosity,

12:33.620 --> 12:35.553
Um, uh, what, in your opinion,

12:35.555 --> 12:38.022
Would qualify
as a good explanation?

12:38.024 --> 12:40.125
I don't know.
Y-your car broke down

12:40.127 --> 12:41.793
Outside of the place.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.462
And then the tornado was coming,
so you took shelter inside.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.898
And then once you got in there,
you contracted a rare disease

12:46.900 --> 12:50.235
That could only be cured
by playing laser tag.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.771
Wow, it's like you were there.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.105
What the hell, man?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.473
You said you had my back.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.041
Why do you keep doing this?

12:57.043 --> 12:58.243
He thinks I'm cool.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.644
I mean, when jake was a kid,

12:59.646 --> 13:01.246
He thought charlie
was the cool one.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.381
When you moved in, jake
thought you were the cool one.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.749
Now it's my turn.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.485
Louis thinks I'm al-al cool dad.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.920
No, he doesn't.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.488
He's using this

13:10.490 --> 13:13.892
To manipulate you just like
ms. Mcmartin said he would.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.227
Oh, so the-the only possible
reason that someone

13:16.229 --> 13:18.563
Would like me is because
they're trying to manipulate me?

13:18.565 --> 13:20.565
Yes, that's right!

13:20.567 --> 13:24.469
You're not al-al cool dad,
you're just weird al.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.805
Okay, first of all,

13:26.807 --> 13:29.340
That's a compliment
to a lover of puns.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.743
Secondly,
you're overreacting.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.344
Overreacting?

13:34.747 --> 13:36.347
(quietly): I asked you
to get louis a backpack.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.349
Instead you got him stitches!

13:38.351 --> 13:39.684
Uh, actually,
it's a liquid band.

13:39.686 --> 13:42.020
Shut up!

13:42.022 --> 13:43.922
Louis is fine.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.957
Kids get hurt all the time,
especially boys.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.325
Jake was constantly
banging his head.
Okay,

13:47.327 --> 13:49.594
I really don't think you should
be using jake as an example.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.330
Oh, so what are you saying? That
I did a bad job raising my son?

13:52.332 --> 13:55.800
Jake is great, but he did just
send you a photo from tokyo

13:55.802 --> 13:58.937
And said-- and I quote-- "look
at what a great job they did

13:58.939 --> 14:01.806
Rebuilding the city
after godzilla."

14:01.808 --> 14:05.176
Okay, I may not be
the best parent in the world,

14:05.178 --> 14:07.846
But at least I found a woman
willing to have a kid with me.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.781
Okay, you know what,
we should drop this.

14:09.783 --> 14:12.016
Like you did jake,
on his head, repeatedly.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.785
Yeah. I don't have to take this.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.553
So I am just gonna walk away.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.555
Like every woman
you've ever dated.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.058
Oh, no, you're
gonna walk away?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.793
Well, when am I
gonna see you again?

14:21.795 --> 14:23.962
Oh, I know. In 20 minutes,

14:23.964 --> 14:26.865
At my house,
where you live rent-free.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.467
Proctology is on
the eighth floor, walden!

14:29.469 --> 14:31.903
In case you'd like
to get that stick removed.

14:31.905 --> 14:35.306
Al-al cool dad, out.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.246
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

14:43.515 --> 14:45.016
Morning.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.351
Morning.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.586
I want you to know
I spent a lot of time thinking

14:48.588 --> 14:49.888
About everything last night.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.089
And?

14:51.091 --> 14:54.025
And I think
an apology is sufficient.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.627
I don't need a gift.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.329
Although I certainly
wouldn't refuse

14:58.331 --> 14:59.697
A new panini press.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.165
That's a great idea.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.067
You know, if I bought you
a panini press,

15:03.069 --> 15:06.704
Would you smash your balls
between the hot metal grates?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.539
Oh, okay.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.242
I see I'm the only one
capable of being a mature adult,

15:11.244 --> 15:13.344
So to you I say...

15:13.346 --> 15:14.712
(blows raspberry)

15:14.714 --> 15:16.614
You spit on me.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.949
Oh, did I?

15:17.951 --> 15:19.183
(blows raspberry)

15:19.185 --> 15:20.451
Okay.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.719
Let's go.
(blows raspberry)

15:21.721 --> 15:23.288
(blows raspberry)

15:23.290 --> 15:25.523
(both blowing raspberries)

15:25.525 --> 15:26.991
Can I play, too?

15:28.360 --> 15:30.595
(blows raspberry)

15:30.597 --> 15:33.865
Hey, buddy, uh, you're already
finished with your chores?

15:33.867 --> 15:35.800
Yup, I made my bed.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.036
What a responsible
young man.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.638
I asked you to do
something and you did it.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.974
And he's six.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.610
Hey, uh, buddy, now that you're
finished with your chores,

15:45.612 --> 15:47.979
What do you say
we go bowling, huh?

15:47.981 --> 15:49.314
Doesn't that sound fun?

15:49.316 --> 15:50.982
We get to wear
other people's shoes.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.250
Can alan come?

15:52.252 --> 15:54.252
Oh...

15:54.254 --> 15:56.421
Alan already wears
other people's shoes.

15:56.423 --> 16:00.258
I actually have to go
to the grocery store, anyway.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.827
Do you know what else
would be fun?

16:02.829 --> 16:04.929
Hey, anything you want to do.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.065
Let's go to the grocery
store with alan.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.469
(blows raspberry)

16:11.471 --> 16:14.472
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

16:14.474 --> 16:16.140
Can I get pop tarts?

16:16.142 --> 16:19.010
(french accent):
Ah, pop tarts.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.912
This is a wonderful
choice.

16:20.914 --> 16:23.982
Might I suggest
the classic strawberry?

16:23.984 --> 16:26.484
Is best by 2016.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.586
This is an excellent year.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.456
Anything for the lady?

16:31.458 --> 16:35.093
Perhaps a glass
of kiss my shir-ass.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.128
Oh, oh.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.029
What do you got there, buddy?

16:38.031 --> 16:40.365
I want froot loops.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.034
You know, we only get
one special treat.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.670
So if you want those, we
got to put the pop tarts back.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.138
But I want both.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.941
Well, here's the thing:
We can't have both.

16:49.943 --> 16:52.710
So... That's the rule.

17:00.819 --> 17:03.454
Ooh, this should be good.

17:06.892 --> 17:09.160
Okay, louis...

17:09.162 --> 17:10.628
You heard what I said.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.096
You can't have these.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.203
Oh, snap...

17:19.205 --> 17:21.272
Crackle and pop.

17:25.177 --> 17:26.811
What are you doing?

17:26.813 --> 17:28.479
I want froot loops.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.748
Okay, I'm gonna count to three,

17:30.750 --> 17:33.451
And if you don't get up,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

17:35.020 --> 17:38.189
Ooh, counting. This is some
groundbreaking stuff.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.258
One...

17:41.593 --> 17:42.760
...Two...

17:44.396 --> 17:45.563
...Three.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.033
One...

17:49.035 --> 17:51.102
One and a half...

17:51.104 --> 17:53.938
Well, you clearly
have this under control.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.040
I'm gonna go check out the
cuties in the produce section.

17:56.042 --> 17:59.510
And I may or may not
be talking about the tangerines.

18:01.046 --> 18:02.847
You hear that, louis?
He's leaving.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.949
And I, now, I guess,

18:04.951 --> 18:07.185
Now I'm leaving, so...

18:07.187 --> 18:09.020
Unless you want to live
here in the cereal aisle,

18:09.022 --> 18:11.255
I suggest you get up.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.193
All right, okay.
Here we go, then.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.928
Have fun.
(chuckles)

18:16.930 --> 18:19.430
I hope captain crunch
can put you through college.

18:24.803 --> 18:27.004
Next stop
is the checkout aisle.

18:28.974 --> 18:30.775
That's it.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.144
I am not kidding,
I mean it. I am leaving.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.213
Alan (imitating p.A.):
Attention shoppers,

18:35.215 --> 18:36.881
We are having
a two-for-one sale

18:36.883 --> 18:40.718
On meaningless threats
in aisle five.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.487
Can you help me out here?
Help? Oh, oh.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.921
You want me to help?

18:43.923 --> 18:46.724
Well, I suppose I could
drop him on his head repeatedly.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.961
Okay, you know what,
I deserve that.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.096
Yesterday I said some
things that I regret.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.999
Mm. Like what?
God, do we have
to do this now?

18:55.001 --> 18:56.167
Why not? I'm not going anywhere.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.803
Clearly, he's not
going anywhere.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.773
Okay, fine, I said that-that
you're not a very good father.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.809
And that is
simply not true.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.077
Thank you.

19:06.079 --> 19:08.079
That must have been
hard for you to say.

19:08.081 --> 19:11.115
And jake is a very bright
and capable young man.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.551
And that must have been
damn near impossible to say.

19:14.953 --> 19:17.188
But... Very sweet.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.790
Um, I shouldn't have gone
behind your back with louis.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.660
But it just, it felt so good
that he wanted to be with me.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.929
And I've never been
anybody's first pick before.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.498
You were my first pick
to help me raise a kid.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.201
Clean up on aisle five.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.802
The floor's about to be
covered in tears.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.771
Okay. Can-can you
give me a hand here?

19:36.008 --> 19:38.109
Okay, I've seen this
a million times before.

19:38.111 --> 19:40.778
There is one surefire parental
technique that always works.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.352
He wanted froot loops.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.888
We're good parents.
We really are.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.757
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

19:56.161 --> 19:58.162
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª
louis is all tucked in.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.497
Oh, yeah?

19:59.499 --> 20:01.632
No extra
bedtime story?

20:01.634 --> 20:03.501
No secret dessert?

20:03.503 --> 20:06.037
No dancing like
no one's watching?

20:06.039 --> 20:09.240
No jazz hands were raised,
no heels were kicked.

20:09.242 --> 20:12.009
I appreciate that.
I got your back.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.378
And to say thank you,

20:14.380 --> 20:17.582
I got you a
special surprise.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.819
(gasps)
froot loops!

20:21.821 --> 20:23.321
Shh.
â™ª secret, secret

20:23.323 --> 20:26.390
Both:
â™ª we got a secret.
