12:48.450 --> 12:51.360
AGENT:
Clear!

13:11.950 --> 13:13.700
MURTAUGH:You don’t see the problem?

13:13.700 --> 13:16.070
You went full-on Spider-Man

13:16.070 --> 13:19.820
without so much as giving
your partner a heads-up. Me.

13:19.820 --> 13:21.990
I was trying to make sure
no one got hurt.

13:21.990 --> 13:24.030
That’s exactly what
I’m trying to do.

13:24.030 --> 13:24.990
But we’re on the same team.

13:24.990 --> 13:27.360
Look, I don’t know what
you been through before,

13:27.360 --> 13:31.490
but if this is gonna work,
then you have to open up.

13:31.490 --> 13:32.490
You got to let me in.

13:32.490 --> 13:35.240
Dance with me.
You’re moonwalking.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.280
You look like you’re
coming forward,

13:36.280 --> 13:38.820
but you’re going backwards
in the relationship.

13:38.820 --> 13:41.320
STAN :
I saw your record.

13:41.320 --> 13:41.740
Assault,

13:41.740 --> 13:44.990
armed robbery,
loyal Sureños foot soldier.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.240
That’s not who I am anymore.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.240
I moved 400 miles away.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.400
I got an honest life.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.400
But they found me.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.990
Who found you?
They gave me a gun
and a name.

13:54.990 --> 13:56.280
Who?
We spent six months

13:56.280 --> 13:59.030
building this case,
and it died with Eddie Ross.

13:59.030 --> 14:00.740
Who ordered the hits?

14:00.740 --> 14:01.900
I’m a dead man if I tell you.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.650
You’re a dead man
if you don’t.

14:03.650 --> 14:04.700
I’ll make sure
you get murder one.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.740
COLE :
Hey, Darwin, what these guys
are trying to say is

14:07.740 --> 14:08.530
if you give us a name,

14:08.530 --> 14:10.320
we’ll protect you
and your family.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.530
They’re just saying it wrong.

14:12.530 --> 14:14.200
Hey, Cole, all right,

14:14.200 --> 14:16.990
we get our turn
after the Feds.

14:16.990 --> 14:17.900
Let’s take our turn now.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.280
I mean, he’s not gonna
give us a name

14:19.280 --> 14:21.150
and leave his family
hanging out to dry.

14:21.150 --> 14:22.150
Wait, would you...

14:22.150 --> 14:23.450
Hey, Darwin,
you help us out,

14:23.450 --> 14:24.490
we’ll bring your family in.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.240
Would you shut him up?
Come on.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.990
Stop it.
There’s protocol.

14:27.990 --> 14:29.900
DARWIN:
Luca Chavez.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.490
He ordered the hit.

14:31.490 --> 14:32.490
They call him "Exit Wound"

14:32.490 --> 14:35.490
’cause of all the times
he’s gotten shot.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.530
That’s how I like to dance.

14:42.150 --> 14:44.900
He did not just moonwalk on me.

14:46.900 --> 14:49.820
MURTAUGH:
Doc, you have to look
into Cole for me.

14:49.820 --> 14:52.950
The thing is,
I’m-I’m kind of slammed today.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.410
All I need you to do
is a quick drive-by.

14:54.610 --> 14:57.610
Casually look under the
hood, check the fluids.

14:57.610 --> 15:01.780
Make sure he’s firing
on all cylinders. Hmm?

15:01.780 --> 15:03.400
I’m not a mechanic.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.740
Look, it’s day one,
Murtaugh.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.150
What’s really going on?

15:09.150 --> 15:12.200
Do I need to check
under your hood?

15:12.200 --> 15:15.070
Me? No.

15:15.070 --> 15:17.110
I-I’m just trying to expedite.

15:17.110 --> 15:20.240
In the interest of learning
from past experience,

15:20.240 --> 15:23.450
you know, if there’s any
fine-tuning to be done,

15:23.450 --> 15:27.780
let’s do it now before
I drive him off the lot.

15:27.780 --> 15:29.990
You know?

15:35.570 --> 15:36.400
You must be Cole.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.240
Let me guess, I still have
that "new detective" smell.

15:40.570 --> 15:45.700
I’m Maureen Cahill.
So, how goes day one?

15:45.700 --> 15:46.650
Not bad.
The wide range

15:46.650 --> 15:48.740
in the snack selection
is a nice surprise.

15:48.740 --> 15:49.990
Yeah, it’s the little things.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.740
This must be quite a change
from your previous gig.

15:52.740 --> 15:57.700
Okay, I see
what’s happening here.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.740
Okay, uh, you’re not wrong.

16:00.740 --> 16:02.650
And I’m seriously flattered.

16:02.650 --> 16:04.200
Flattered?

16:04.650 --> 16:05.320
Oh, no, I’m not...

16:05.320 --> 16:06.200
If I wasn’t in
such a weird place--

16:06.200 --> 16:08.570
you know, I just found out
that my ex is seeing someone,

16:08.570 --> 16:10.240
and it’s kind of
a vulnerable time for me--

16:10.240 --> 16:11.950
then I’d so be
returning those vibes.

16:11.950 --> 16:13.570
Oh, I assure you,
there are no vibes.

16:13.570 --> 16:16.400
I’m just being friendly.
Hey, you put yourself out there,

16:16.400 --> 16:17.860
and that was
a brave thing to do.

16:17.860 --> 16:21.740
Okay, uh, we’re-we’re done.

16:22.240 --> 16:26.110
Surgery is not
for the faint of heart,

16:26.110 --> 16:27.950
but the cath lab is.

16:27.950 --> 16:32.030
Get it? ’Cause that’s how
you wind up in the thing.

16:32.030 --> 16:35.320
Dr. Flynn, do you got a minute?

16:35.320 --> 16:38.280
Don’t go far, I might
need a trauma unit.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.400
Wow, you’re showing up here

16:41.400 --> 16:42.700
after what happened
this morning?

16:42.700 --> 16:45.200
I just want you to know
that he checks out.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.490
Who?
Andrew.

16:46.490 --> 16:47.820
Your anesthesiologist companion.

16:47.820 --> 16:50.650
He’s totally clean.
No felonies.

16:50.650 --> 16:51.700
Not even a parking ticket.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.400
But you should know that
he did a year of med
school in Guam, so...

16:54.400 --> 16:58.200
Yeah, it was a summer program.
Are you kidding?

16:58.200 --> 17:01.650
What business is that of...?

17:01.650 --> 17:02.530
You ran a background
check on him?

17:02.530 --> 17:05.400
Yeah, of course. If he’s gonna
be in your life and Maya’s...

17:05.400 --> 17:08.780
If he’s going...

17:08.780 --> 17:09.320
Cole, he is.

17:09.320 --> 17:14.490
He is a part of our lives,
and he has been

17:14.490 --> 17:17.150
far longer than you were.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.530
Ouch.

17:20.530 --> 17:22.780
Okay, well,
just so you know,

17:22.780 --> 17:26.780
sometimes when a background
checks out too clean...
Cole.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.990
You’re calling me
at 4:00 in the morning,

17:28.990 --> 17:32.820
assaulting my friend;
what is it?

17:32.820 --> 17:34.900
What is it that you want?

17:34.900 --> 17:38.030
I just wanted to talk.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.860
About what?

17:42.450 --> 17:43.860
Do you think this
is going to last?

17:43.860 --> 17:47.200
Is Andy in it for
the long haul?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.360
I’m going back to work.

17:51.530 --> 17:55.200
40-year-old male,
gunshot wound.

17:57.820 --> 17:58.860
Excuse me.

17:58.860 --> 18:02.400
Any chance you remember
treating a Luca Chavez

18:02.400 --> 18:04.280
for a gunshot wound?

18:10.700 --> 18:13.700
Hey, Hector, you’re not open.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.740
Get rid of ’em.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.820
Sí.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.740
Pupusas.
These smell great.

18:26.780 --> 18:28.280
Where’s the cook?

18:28.280 --> 18:29.360
I sent him home.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.030
I’m looking for
Luca Chavez, aka...

18:36.610 --> 18:40.200
Cool, I think I found him.

18:42.740 --> 18:45.360
Hey, cops aren’t allowed
to torture.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.950
That’s more of a suggestion.

19:00.490 --> 19:01.570
You ever been burned, Luca?

19:01.570 --> 19:04.650
Funny thing is,
at first it feels

19:04.650 --> 19:06.610
ice cold.

19:06.610 --> 19:09.900
Something about the pain
receptors in your brain

19:09.900 --> 19:11.320
being overwhelmed.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.610
I don’t know,
it’s all science stuff.

19:13.610 --> 19:18.030
I mostly read comic books
during those classes.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.490
Did you kill Eddie Ross?

19:22.490 --> 19:24.700
No.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.320
Okay, okay, okay!

19:28.320 --> 19:30.610
What the hell, man?
What’s wrong with you?!

19:30.610 --> 19:31.700
I told Darwin
to handle it, okay?

19:31.700 --> 19:36.200
But he walked away,
so who finished the job

19:36.200 --> 19:39.650
No! No, no, no!

19:39.650 --> 19:41.240
I swear it wasn’t me, man!

19:41.240 --> 19:42.990
Well, it had to have
been somebody.

19:42.990 --> 19:44.820
Ross had other clients.

19:44.820 --> 19:47.490
We weren’t the only ones
that wanted him dead, man.

19:47.490 --> 19:51.570
Well, now we’re
getting somewhere.

19:55.780 --> 19:56.280
A damn popsicle?

19:56.280 --> 19:59.450
Yeah. I saw that bit
in a comic book once.

19:59.450 --> 20:02.280
I think the lesson here
is: read more.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.490
What the hell’d
you do that for?!

20:51.490 --> 20:52.820
He had a gun!

20:54.110 --> 20:56.200
Get him off me!
He saved your life.

20:56.200 --> 21:00.070
Don’t take other people’s lives
to save mine.

21:00.070 --> 21:01.740
It’s not zero sum.

21:01.740 --> 21:04.700
You’re welcome!

21:04.700 --> 21:07.400
Hey, you gonna
tell me your deal?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.570
Because I don’t
understand you.

21:08.570 --> 21:13.200
There’s no deal.
I’m an open book.

21:13.450 --> 21:16.860
Why don’t you head back?
I’ll work the scene with them.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.780
We’re supposed to be partners.

21:18.780 --> 21:21.360
I don’t know much
about you except

21:21.360 --> 21:25.110
I don’t think you’ll ever
be anybody’s partner.

21:35.700 --> 21:37.200
Hey, what is all this?

21:37.200 --> 21:39.780
Roger, dinner.

21:39.780 --> 21:40.860
Your partner?

21:40.860 --> 21:43.570
Oh, right.
That was tonight?

21:43.570 --> 21:48.200
Yeah, well, it
looks delicious.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.320
So where is he, Dad?

21:51.320 --> 21:52.280
Who

21:52.280 --> 21:53.950
Is

21:53.950 --> 21:54.820
Hmm.

21:54.820 --> 21:57.490
Oh. Yeah.

21:57.490 --> 21:58.200
He’s not.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.400
RIANA: Oh, my gosh, I
could be studying for

21:59.400 --> 22:00.780
AP Gov right now.
I just wasted
a whole night.

22:00.780 --> 22:02.700
TRISH: You know what?
I put all of this together

22:02.700 --> 22:05.650
at the last minute, Roger,
because you asked me.

22:05.650 --> 22:08.530
And it looks
beautiful. Okay? Yum.

22:08.530 --> 22:09.610
But it’s minus one person.

22:09.610 --> 22:11.030
RIANA: Okay, everyone
dropped everything

22:11.030 --> 22:13.650
for this,
and you forced us to come.

22:13.650 --> 22:14.900
I forced you to come?
Yeah.

22:14.900 --> 22:17.990
Hey.
Here’s what I’ve learned today.

22:17.990 --> 22:22.700
I cannot force anyone
to do anything.

22:26.150 --> 22:28.950
You know what?
Dinner’s over.

22:28.950 --> 22:29.740
Just go.

22:29.740 --> 22:31.610
Did he just say...?
Riana.

22:31.610 --> 22:33.320
Go pretend to study somewhere.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.700
And, RJ, you’re released.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.950
I-I-- but I don’t have
any plans.

22:37.950 --> 22:39.490
Don’t care. Find some.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.650
Make some up. Here’s some money.

22:41.650 --> 22:43.070
You want to go see a movie?

22:43.070 --> 22:45.530
Buy alcohol,
I don’t care. Just go.

22:45.530 --> 22:49.610
Come on, like, this is a once
in a lifetime type of thing,

22:49.610 --> 22:51.030
like an eclipse or something.

22:51.030 --> 22:54.110
Just, just come on.
Just...

23:01.030 --> 23:03.570
What was that?

23:05.530 --> 23:07.450
You were right, okay?

23:07.450 --> 23:08.860
I...

23:08.860 --> 23:12.030
jumped without looking.

23:12.030 --> 23:15.820
I should’ve vetted
the guy better.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.320
My gut stinks.

23:17.320 --> 23:21.280
And no, I don’t want
to talk about it.

23:24.780 --> 23:28.240
You will tell me
when you’re ready.

23:44.450 --> 23:47.360
Cole, your shift
ended hours ago.

23:47.360 --> 23:47.950
Go home, get some sleep.

23:47.950 --> 23:50.490
Yeah, I tried,
but it didn’t take, so I figured

23:50.490 --> 23:53.030
I’d keep working
on this Eddie Ross business.

23:53.030 --> 23:54.900
The dead banker?
Yeah.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.650
I’m not convinced
we have the shooter.

23:56.650 --> 23:59.700
I’ve been looking into his other
clients, their financials,

23:59.700 --> 24:00.650
and it is
a rabbit hole.

24:00.650 --> 24:03.860
You think it’d be enough
to put me to sleep.

24:03.860 --> 24:07.030
You know who’s good
at financials, is Murtaugh.

24:09.530 --> 24:10.820
I’m not sure
that’s gonna work out.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.650
Well, give it time.
He’ll settle down.

24:12.650 --> 24:14.110
Everything Murtaugh’s
been through...

24:14.110 --> 24:16.650
No, no, he’s been great.
It’s me.

24:16.650 --> 24:19.030
I think you work
alone long enough,

24:19.030 --> 24:20.320
and something
in your brain shifts,

24:20.320 --> 24:23.400
and, and it’s the only way
you can be.

24:23.400 --> 24:27.450
I’m not sure I can give Murtaugh
whatever it is he wants.

24:29.450 --> 24:30.900
Well, good news, Detective.

24:30.900 --> 24:34.450
It’s not a big mystery what
Murtaugh wants from a partner.

24:34.450 --> 24:37.280
All or nothing. That’s it.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.150
That doesn’t sound healthy.

24:40.150 --> 24:40.860
Correct.

24:40.860 --> 24:42.490
I was his partner once.
It’s not.

24:42.490 --> 24:45.110
The guy wants
constant communication.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.360
Open-door policy, no boundaries.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.950
It’s highly dysfunctional
and probably not for everyone.

24:49.950 --> 24:53.280
But I can’t recommend it enough.

24:53.280 --> 24:56.110
Hmm.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.360
Are you thinking, as long
as you don’t come upstairs,

25:15.360 --> 25:19.820
you can pretend
all of this never happened?

25:19.820 --> 25:20.610
:
Maybe.

25:20.610 --> 25:27.110
I think I just wanted
to have another partner again.

25:28.530 --> 25:30.530
I thought...
I know what you thought.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.400
I know what you thought.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.150
Baby.

25:33.150 --> 25:38.490
You cannot skip to the finish
line without running the race.

25:38.490 --> 25:42.360
I wasn’t being honest
with myself.

25:43.860 --> 25:46.570
That makes both of us.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.110
I wasn’t being honest, either,

25:49.110 --> 25:54.070
about why I fought you
on this dinner.

25:54.280 --> 25:57.110
:
I just...

25:58.530 --> 26:03.950
I don’t think I’m ready to
welcome somebody to our table.

26:03.950 --> 26:07.280
And-and you made it
out of the woods, but, uh,

26:07.280 --> 26:09.110
I’m still there.

26:09.110 --> 26:12.740
Then I’ll come get you.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.610
Hey, it’s been
a tough six months.

26:18.610 --> 26:21.610
And some things
were lost between us.

26:21.610 --> 26:24.030
We were grieving
and we still are.

26:24.030 --> 26:28.860
But the clouds
are starting to lift.

26:28.860 --> 26:32.610
Aren’t they?
A little every day.

26:34.900 --> 26:36.240
Okay.

26:36.240 --> 26:40.450
So... before we invite

26:40.450 --> 26:43.570
anyone else to the mix,

26:43.570 --> 26:49.400
maybe we should take some time
to rekindle us.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.360
I like that thought.
Yeah?

26:51.360 --> 26:52.490
Mm-hmm.

26:52.490 --> 26:55.990
You know, when we,
uh, first got married,

26:55.990 --> 26:58.780
we used to do a lot of, uh...

26:58.780 --> 27:02.860
rekindling all around
this house.

27:02.860 --> 27:03.780
Did we?

27:03.780 --> 27:04.400
Mm-hmm.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.780
It’s a pretty big house, Roger.
Mm-hmm.

27:06.780 --> 27:09.650
All right, so...

27:09.650 --> 27:13.490
Maybe we should,
uh, get started.

27:13.490 --> 27:14.820
Okay, you get the wine,

27:14.820 --> 27:16.740
I’ll go get the mood.

27:16.740 --> 27:18.240
Okay.
Mm.

27:22.990 --> 27:25.570

You’re right.

28:15.900 --> 28:18.450
What do you think he saw?

28:18.450 --> 28:20.070
:
Everything?

28:20.070 --> 28:21.610
I didn’t see that much.

28:21.610 --> 28:22.320
He didn’t see much.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.740
COLE:
This is on me, guys.

28:23.740 --> 28:26.450
Avery said you like
a completely open-door policy.

28:26.450 --> 28:28.150
Open
There’s no policy.

28:28.150 --> 28:29.860
TRISH: There has to be an open
door. You must’ve said that.

28:29.860 --> 28:32.400
No.
COLE:
He used the term loosely.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.900
Is this the conversation
we’re having now?

28:35.900 --> 28:38.280
For the love of God, man, go.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.700
You got it.

28:39.700 --> 28:40.530
Trish, I’m sorry.

28:40.530 --> 28:43.280
Look, why don’t we
triple lock the door,

28:43.280 --> 28:45.490
take this upstairs,
lock that door,

28:45.490 --> 28:48.400
and maybe we can salvage
some of this.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.740
Zero chance of that happening.

28:49.740 --> 28:54.070
♪ Float on, float on,
float on... ♪

28:54.070 --> 28:57.740
Yeah. It’s not gonna happen.

28:58.490 --> 28:59.570
Ballistics didn’t match
Darwin’s gun,

28:59.570 --> 29:02.200
so we ran a background check
on Eddie Ross’s other clients.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.030
How many are there?
We narrowed it to...

29:05.030 --> 29:06.650
Bailey.

29:07.110 --> 29:10.150
How many are there, Bailey?

29:10.150 --> 29:12.780
Based on background check alone,

29:12.780 --> 29:14.900
we narrowed it down
to six suspects,

29:14.900 --> 29:17.950
and Cole ranked them
in order of interest.

29:17.950 --> 29:18.780
What was going on here?

29:18.780 --> 29:20.900
Bailey, would you tell
Detective Murtaugh

29:20.900 --> 29:23.150
that those are client bank
statements and phone records?

29:23.150 --> 29:26.610
Two piles: bank statements,
phone records.

29:26.610 --> 29:27.070
Bailey,

29:27.070 --> 29:29.740
will you ask
Detective What’s-His-Face

29:29.740 --> 29:30.990
if he cross

29:30.990 --> 29:32.360
BAILEY:
You know what?

29:32.360 --> 29:33.320
I’m not doing this,

29:33.320 --> 29:35.030
’cause I still have
a shred of dignity left.

29:35.030 --> 29:38.280
Oh, yeah? Wait till he
shows up at your house

29:38.280 --> 29:39.740
a little past midnight.

29:39.740 --> 29:40.900
He’ll take care of that.

29:40.900 --> 29:43.650
Yep. A hundred percent
called for.

29:43.650 --> 29:46.820
Also, great idea,
cross-referencing.

29:46.820 --> 29:51.030
Okay, so we’re looking
for inconsistencies

29:51.030 --> 29:52.280
with Eddie’s clients.

29:52.280 --> 29:55.950
Things that
don’t make sense.
Like...

29:55.950 --> 29:58.070
Like...

29:58.070 --> 29:59.240

He’s a millionaire.

29:59.990 --> 30:03.530

five-figure deposits.

30:03.530 --> 30:04.150
Made one last week.

30:04.150 --> 30:08.650
But his phone was
deactivated two months ago.

30:08.650 --> 30:11.820
Odd?
What’s the client’s name?

30:11.820 --> 30:13.780
Felz.

30:13.780 --> 30:16.070
Enrico Felz?

30:16.070 --> 30:17.950
Well, what
do you know?

One thing you should
know about me, Cole,

30:59.650 --> 31:02.400
I’m a home restoration
enthusiast.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.860
I believe it.
I saw your kitchen.

31:03.860 --> 31:07.150
Ugh, no, no, no, no, that’s not
the proper response.

something with you,

31:10.280 --> 31:12.990
you share something
of your own,

31:12.990 --> 31:15.780
not remind me of the kitchen.

31:15.780 --> 31:16.650
Where I saw your wife naked.

31:16.650 --> 31:20.150
Yeah.
Listen, we’re gonna
get past that.

31:20.860 --> 31:24.110
So, apology still not accepted?

31:26.240 --> 31:29.570
Are you gonna help me, or what?

31:33.610 --> 31:34.820
And that’s why.

31:34.820 --> 31:39.200

31:39.200 --> 31:40.450
Enrico Felz

31:40.450 --> 31:43.450
and his big bag of...

31:46.200 --> 31:47.360
Nothing.

31:49.860 --> 31:51.070
Go, Bailey.

31:51.070 --> 31:51.570
I did a deep dive.

31:51.570 --> 31:53.950
Enrico Felz
is a longtime drug trafficker.

31:53.950 --> 31:57.240
We’re with Enrico right now.
He says hi.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.700
Also, not the shooter.
He’s been dead for months.

Well, his bank account
is still active.

32:02.030 --> 32:03.320
Someone’s using it.

32:03.320 --> 32:05.240
It’s a great way to hide money.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.200
Any idea who?

32:07.950 --> 32:09.570
FBI agents Stan and Ray.

32:09.570 --> 32:12.900
They’re in bed
with the Sureños.

32:12.900 --> 32:14.360
How do you know that?

32:14.360 --> 32:16.320
They’re here.

32:19.820 --> 32:21.110
You seem pretty calm,

32:21.110 --> 32:22.740

surrounding the house.

No, no. We don’t have time.

32:53.150 --> 32:54.780

32:54.780 --> 32:57.570
Well... I thought that
you was making a weapon.

32:57.570 --> 32:58.900
It looks like a white flag.

32:58.900 --> 32:59.650
It is a white flag.

32:59.650 --> 33:02.070

to discuss the plan.

33:02.070 --> 33:03.070

The plan is, we surrender.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.610
MURTAUGH:Surrender

33:15.610 --> 33:16.700
We were outnumbered
five to one.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.740
If we had fought, they
would’ve killed us.

33:19.740 --> 33:22.490
And-and what do you think
they’re gonna do now?

33:22.490 --> 33:24.400
Well, they’re
gonna interrogate us

33:24.400 --> 33:25.610

gonna kill us.

Sounds like
you’re not guessing.

It’s not my
first freezer.

What side of the freezer
were you on before?

33:33.900 --> 33:35.110
In here or out there?

33:35.110 --> 33:36.650
I’ve been on both sides.

33:36.650 --> 33:39.820
Any second they’re gonna
pull one of us out of here

33:39.820 --> 33:40.820
and starting
working him over.

33:40.820 --> 33:43.200
I’m gonna make sure
that it’s me.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.700
Why can’t I go first?

33:44.700 --> 33:47.860
’Cause you don’t
deserve it.

33:47.860 --> 33:52.280
Well, nice and
cool in here.

33:52.950 --> 33:55.450
Take the old one.

33:59.530 --> 34:01.360
Change of plans.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.450
I want him.

34:31.990 --> 34:34.110
Where’s the money?

34:34.110 --> 34:35.360

under the couch?

34:35.360 --> 34:36.570
That’s where I lose everything.

34:36.570 --> 34:40.110
That’s very funny.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.490
The money that was in the bag.
Hidden in the wall.

34:42.490 --> 34:45.030
Is it coming back
to you now?

34:45.030 --> 34:46.650
Yeah, it’s coming
back to me.

34:46.650 --> 34:48.650
No, no, no. I lost it.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.070

34:51.070 --> 34:53.990
I lost it again. Sorry.

34:53.990 --> 34:55.150
Wait.

34:55.150 --> 34:57.650
Protection money
from the Sureños?

34:57.650 --> 34:59.110
How much are
they paying you

34:59.110 --> 35:00.950
to get the FBI
off their backs?

35:00.950 --> 35:01.740
$2 million.

35:01.740 --> 35:05.320
So you can understand
why we’re a little concerned.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.740
Where is it?

35:06.740 --> 35:08.570

everything, right?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.650
Oh, that’s right,
you can’t.

35:12.650 --> 35:15.030
You killed him.

35:15.360 --> 35:16.900
HANNI:Cole!

35:16.900 --> 35:20.240
You’re gonna be...
you’re gonna be okay.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.650
Hanni.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.950
Last chance.

35:42.950 --> 35:44.700
Where is it?

35:46.700 --> 35:48.070
Your partner has it.

35:48.070 --> 35:51.240
You really gonna listen
to this guy, Ray?

35:51.240 --> 35:51.820
COLE:
Think about it.

35:51.820 --> 35:53.650
Who else knew what was
hidden behind that wall?

35:53.650 --> 35:56.280
We’ve been partners
for 30 years, Ray.

35:56.280 --> 36:00.030
COLE: 30 years of resentment
and petty arguments,

36:00.030 --> 36:02.780
listening to all
your dumb jokes.

36:02.780 --> 36:04.030
It’s a long time.

36:04.030 --> 36:07.280
STAN: Hit him again.
Shut this guy up.

36:15.070 --> 36:17.490
COLE:Who wouldn’t want
to grab a payday

36:17.490 --> 36:20.360
and get the hell out
after 30 years?

36:27.360 --> 36:29.150
Did you take my money, Stan?

36:29.150 --> 36:31.110
STAN:Your money?

36:39.200 --> 36:41.530
STAN:Screw you, Ray.

36:41.530 --> 36:42.530
I earned every penny.

36:42.530 --> 36:44.110
Screw me? You son of a bitch.

36:44.110 --> 36:44.700
Yeah, I’m out of here.

36:44.700 --> 36:45.990
RAY: What the hell
are you talking about?

36:45.990 --> 36:48.610
You don’t walk
away from me, Stan.

37:04.610 --> 37:06.740
MURTAUGH:
Cole!

37:11.740 --> 37:13.200
Murtaugh!

37:16.530 --> 37:18.860
You were supposed
to escape, then leave.

37:18.860 --> 37:21.400
Now who’s ignoring our plan?

37:29.610 --> 37:29.780
Wow.

37:29.780 --> 37:36.650
Whatever happens in the future,
let’s not be like these guys.

37:36.650 --> 37:38.740
Yeah.

37:38.740 --> 37:40.360
Good shot.

37:42.700 --> 37:44.530
Doc, so what’d you
learn about Cole?

37:44.530 --> 37:46.320
Oh, from four minutes
in the break room?

37:46.320 --> 37:48.650
He’s either
a pathological narcissist

37:48.650 --> 37:51.450
or it’s a highly developed
defense mechanism.

37:51.450 --> 37:54.070
And as a non-shrink might say...

37:54.070 --> 37:57.320
He thought I was
hitting on him.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.240
Did you?

37:58.240 --> 38:00.150
No.
I-I don’t know.

38:00.150 --> 38:02.110
He seems to be a
good-looking guy.

38:02.110 --> 38:04.610
Picked yourself a winner.
Okay.

38:04.610 --> 38:08.360
So when do you
start treating him?

38:08.360 --> 38:09.110
Oh, I’m not.

38:09.110 --> 38:11.950
It would take six months
just to scratch the surface.

38:11.950 --> 38:18.780
Odds are he’s protecting
some devastating scars.

38:19.150 --> 38:21.950
So was the last guy.

38:22.610 --> 38:24.860
And I have my own scars
to show for it.

38:24.860 --> 38:27.820
I’m sorry.
I-I can’t help you

38:27.820 --> 38:30.030
with this one.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.740
Natalie. Hi.

38:39.740 --> 38:41.400
Hi. So, uh, super last minute,

38:41.400 --> 38:44.990
but I was wondering
if maybe you’d like to come by

38:44.990 --> 38:45.650
for dinner tonight.

38:45.650 --> 38:48.030
Are you sure you’re calling
the right Cole?

38:48.030 --> 38:51.450
Yes, I know who I’m calling.

38:51.450 --> 38:52.530
Super casual.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.650
Just the four of us.

38:54.650 --> 38:56.070
Is Andrew okay with this?

38:56.070 --> 38:57.950
I think he feels guilty

38:57.950 --> 39:00.450
about calling the cops
on you yesterday.

39:00.450 --> 39:02.990
He didn’t realize you were one.

39:02.990 --> 39:05.820
Okay.

39:05.820 --> 39:06.950
How about you?

39:06.950 --> 39:08.610
Won’t be weird for you?

39:08.610 --> 39:12.200
It’s all a little weird,
but let’s figure it out.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.820
And I’m sure Maya
would love to see you,

39:14.820 --> 39:16.860
so what do you say?

39:16.860 --> 39:18.900
I’ll bring dessert.

39:18.900 --> 39:21.280
Great.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.950
MAYA:
One more, one more,
one more, please.

39:24.950 --> 39:25.450
ANDREW:No.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.990
Come on, this is
the one. I promise.
Fine, do it.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.200
NATALIE: Wow.
Yes.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.900
Nice toss.

39:33.320 --> 39:35.360
Hey, did you get lost?

39:35.360 --> 39:37.200
Hey. No, I got bad news.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.950
I just got called
back to the station.

39:38.950 --> 39:40.610
Oh, no. You want us to wait?

39:40.610 --> 39:43.150
No, no, no.
It’s gonna be a long one.

39:43.150 --> 39:44.400
Criminals in this town,

39:44.400 --> 39:46.900
can’t even take
a break for dinner.

39:46.900 --> 39:47.860
Another time, then.

39:47.860 --> 39:50.240
Next week.
Definitely.

39:50.240 --> 39:52.200

Hey, Roger.

We brought dinner.
Her idea.

40:26.530 --> 40:28.820
It’s not gonna be

40:28.820 --> 40:30.070

It’s a little cozy in here.

40:35.990 --> 40:38.650
Yeah. I don’t do a lot
of dinner parties.

40:38.650 --> 40:40.950
There’s a picnic
table outside.

Um, Roger,

40:44.700 --> 40:47.320
can you give me and Cole
a few minutes alone?

40:47.320 --> 40:49.030
We need to talk.
Just you and Cole?

40:49.030 --> 40:52.530
Just find some plates
or silverware,

40:52.530 --> 40:54.110
something remotely clean.

40:54.110 --> 40:57.780
Good luck with that.

40:59.240 --> 41:03.490
That was not a great start
for us, Cole, was it?

41:03.490 --> 41:05.200
I would agree with that.

41:05.200 --> 41:10.650
You should know that we’re

You get that?

41:17.450 --> 41:18.740
Okay.

41:18.740 --> 41:19.400
I want to know
who you are.

41:19.400 --> 41:24.240
My husband’s gut says
you’re a good guy, and I...

I want to believe that.

Oh.

42:33.740 --> 42:34.240
Yeah.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.110
Oh, found the good china.

42:35.110 --> 42:38.200
Yeah, it looks like it’s
from a gas station giveaway.

42:38.200 --> 42:38.860
Pretty close.

42:38.860 --> 42:40.990
Some freebies from a car wash
in Tripoli.

42:40.990 --> 42:42.700

After Tajikistan
but before Chechnya.

After Chechnya,
before El Salvador.

42:49.900 --> 42:52.820

this man was there.
