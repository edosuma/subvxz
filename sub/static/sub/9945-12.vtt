00:22.320 --> 00:25.471

00:25.560 --> 00:27.949
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.040 --> 00:32.033
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented

00:32.119 --> 00:37.877

04:43.120 --> 04:44.633

04:44.720 --> 04:48.759
I do not leave until I am

04:48.840 --> 04:51.308
- Yeah.
- For your mother's eyes only.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.230

Yeah?

05:24.840 --> 05:25.909
Oof!

05:26.000 --> 05:29.629
I said do not open the door
under any circumstances.

Your mum's right.

06:01.720 --> 06:05.030
You can talk. You couldn't
keep your eyes off 'em.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.678
I saw a millisecond of nipple, Yvonne.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.239
- Swear to you.
- And the rest.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.072
Anyway, back off! You're not me dad.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.072
I'll make me own money,
then I can do what I want.

06:13.160 --> 06:17.392
I catch you with your tits out again,
you're grounded for life. End of!

06:21.400 --> 06:22.594

06:25.840 --> 06:28.354
Like your Hindu god - Thinga.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.159
- Seen Liam?
- He was at ours earlier.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.673
He was going out with Danny.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.318
The school rang,
asking why he's not in.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.992
They haven't seen him
for three days.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.474
- Told me it were teacher training.
- Boy's a genius!

06:41.560 --> 06:45.235
<i>What's Danny's excuse? He might be
able to come and go as he pleases.</i>

06:45.320 --> 06:47.072
Liam can't.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.591
Why is it full of birds in here?

06:56.680 --> 06:58.750
Cos it's a birds' prison, dickhead.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.956
You two, fuck off a minute.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.919
Dirty lezzers. It's enough
to make you want to go to prison.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.399
There's a letter from Dad.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.118
What's going on?

07:10.200 --> 07:13.158
Between me and your father.
How is he?

07:13.240 --> 07:14.958
Cold turkey.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.439
It's a start.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.552
Let's concentrate
on getting you out of here.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.835
Face it, son,
I don't stand a chance.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.514
While Joe's out for the count,
there's no possibility of bail.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.797
And if he doesn't come around,
forget GBH.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.791
I'm up for murder.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.279
It won't come to that.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.590
(Micky) Get your fucking hands off me!

07:36.680 --> 07:38.636
(Man) Break it up!

07:38.720 --> 07:40.915
(Shane) Come on, then,
you fucking slag!

07:45.200 --> 07:48.431
Oh. Too good for my pity.

07:48.520 --> 07:52.274
Fancy yourself in the company
of the elite now, do you?

07:52.360 --> 07:55.989

Sheryl Gascoigne.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.479
Piss off, Frank.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.959
There's nowt to be ashamed of.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.396
Domestic abuse happens
right across the social spectrum.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.313
Even posh birds
get a good hiding now and then.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.311
This is your chance to walk away.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.628
So take it.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.756
What do you think's
gonna happen, Karen?

08:11.840 --> 08:14.035
We both know.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.236
Thanks for your vote of confidence.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.436
If you let Joe
worm his way back in...

08:19.520 --> 08:22.432
...you'll have to move out.
I've got no choice.

08:22.520 --> 08:26.035
That's one less Maguire for poor you
to worry about, then, innit?

08:34.400 --> 08:36.038
I'm starving.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.678
- How was your day?
- Usual.

08:37.760 --> 08:41.196
Double maths, double science.
Geography. We learned about glaciers.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.994
What the hell
do you think you're playing at?

08:50.080 --> 08:54.198
In my defence, can I just say
it's a bit hypocritical of you both,

08:54.280 --> 08:55.395
don't you think?

08:55.480 --> 08:58.392
Don't you dare.
You know this is different.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.879
Just cos we fucked up our chances

08:59.960 --> 09:02.235
don't mean we're gonna
let you do the same.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.517
It's all work, revise, pressure.
I don't want to be one of those kids,

09:05.600 --> 09:08.512
old before my time,
pining for a lost childhood.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.591
That's bollocks and you know it is.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.035
I'm gonna have words with Danny.
Stay away from him.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.599
He's not right in the head.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.272
You wouldn't be
living with him if he was.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.998
<i>I can handle him.</i>

09:22.480 --> 09:24.789
It's not Danny's fault.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.677
I just wanted to go fishing. OK?

09:26.760 --> 09:28.637
I won't do it again.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.358
Promise.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.395
What the fuck?

09:54.600 --> 09:56.830

Shit!

09:58.080 --> 09:59.593

10:52.040 --> 10:55.715
Oh! This one's for free...

10:55.800 --> 10:56.915

10:57.000 --> 10:58.353
Come on, honey!

10:58.440 --> 11:02.831
So much better than Jamie!
I'm a naughty bitch!

11:02.920 --> 11:05.480
Give it to me, Daddy! Give it to me!

11:54.880 --> 11:57.792
Hands above the head
where I can see 'em.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.598
Slowly.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.433
I don't want any sort of moves.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.670
You'd better pray
I'm fucking hallucinating.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.398
Eugh!

12:11.480 --> 12:14.756
Not for eating. Just to suck on
for the taste. Might help.

12:14.840 --> 12:19.152
All I could manage, you know,
when I was where you are.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.708
We'll clean up
while you're in shower.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.519
Take 'em when the cramps kick in.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.679
There's a letter
from Mum for you as well.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.516
I know orgasm's
the next best thing to a hit.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.239
You wank to a picture
of a donkey in a G-string

12:39.320 --> 12:41.072
when you're coming off the gear,

12:41.160 --> 12:44.197
but take it easy,
or little Patrick will be worn away.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.998
You're gonna need him
when Mimi gets out.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.594
Any more pearls of wisdom,
I'll brass you one.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.669
(Shane) Oi!

12:50.760 --> 12:52.830
Let's see if you've
still got that attitude

12:52.920 --> 12:54.433
when you're swimming
in your own shite.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.351
Shower.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.749
Safety's still on.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.553

13:04.640 --> 13:06.437
Oh, that fucking Danny!

13:06.520 --> 13:07.953
Get round 'ere, soon as.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.916
What's going on?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.719
I dunno. Danny's up to something
and he's taken Liam with him.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.518
- I'll tell you on the way.
- Way where?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.069
Is Keith there?

14:26.720 --> 14:28.153
Says he's come back for ya.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.598
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.672
Watersport Ed is in.
Bathroom's out of bounds.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.279
What can I do you for?

14:44.360 --> 14:46.237
- I'm looking for work.
- Oh, lovely.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.709
There's certainly a market.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.438
Oh, no, I didn't mean like that.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.954
I was thinking of more like
an assistant to you.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.395
Take the pressure off, free you up.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.948
I'll clean, prep the rooms,
look after punters.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.429
I wouldn't be asking for much
in the way of wages.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.193
If you took in food and lodgings,
I'd work for next to nowt.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.759
What's the catch?

15:04.840 --> 15:06.717
There isn't one.
I just need a job, like, now.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.598
All right. I'll give you a trial run,
see how it goes.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.989

16:23.960 --> 16:25.996
This is family. You don't quit.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.116
Die, yeah. Quit, no.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.918
I've got a proper job, proper pay.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.515
Bit of work.
Little bit of independence.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.637
- What is it, then?
- Working at Lillian's.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.075
Pakistan for you!

16:43.160 --> 16:45.355
That's your answer to everything!

16:45.440 --> 16:47.556
Better that than ruin your life
selling yourself!

16:47.640 --> 16:50.950
Gonna be star attraction, me.
Gonna be fucking loaded.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.550
And don't bother making me tea,
cos I won't be home. Ever!

16:56.640 --> 16:59.154
No, no, no. Calm down.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.832
When I woke up...

17:24.599 --> 17:27.160
...I knew I'd lost you.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.390
That pain...

17:35.800 --> 17:39.713
...worse than any hiding
anyone could ever give me.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.675
I deserve this.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.113
No.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.634
Jamie had no right.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.599
They have no right. I've my own mind.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.829
I need you.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.950
Just wanted to see
you were all right.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.791
I'll let you get some rest.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.995
I love you.

18:18.200 --> 18:22.637
The only good news about Joe is that
Mimi won't be going down for murder.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.312
You're right.

18:25.720 --> 18:29.508
- That my ears burning?
- Don't be daft.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.750
We were just saying
Yvonne's Asian knicker party

18:31.840 --> 18:33.910
upstairs tomorrow night
should be a laugh.

18:35.520 --> 18:39.149
Mandy, what I said before,
I didn't...

18:58.040 --> 19:00.600
It starts with the lickle things...

19:02.360 --> 19:07.434
...controlling who and where
you spend your time.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.269
What you wear, eat.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.878
Sex gets a little rough.

19:19.120 --> 19:23.033
He gets hypersensitive
to what you say and do.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.871
Then comes blame.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.396
All his wrongs are your fault.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.839
Threats start to happen,
then... Pfft!

19:38.880 --> 19:40.598
What makes you the expert?

19:44.440 --> 19:47.352
Same problem
with every new generation.

19:47.440 --> 19:51.399
You think you're the first
to invent life's experiences.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.993
Seeing Joe...

19:59.080 --> 20:02.231
I was praying for
a tiny hint of anger in him...

20:04.080 --> 20:06.355
...to make it easier for me to leave.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.116
All I saw was him hurting.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.912
I still love him.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.076
That fucked up, or what?

20:19.160 --> 20:21.674
People are judgmental, Mandy.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.155
Love isn't.

20:27.240 --> 20:30.277
Reason why it's the number two
killer in this world.

20:36.280 --> 20:37.759
What's number one?

20:37.840 --> 20:39.478
Well, money, obviously.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.914
- What, they dealing?
- Fuck off, Micky.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.194
They must be selling something.

It's his dad! It's his dad!
It's his dad!

22:27.040 --> 22:28.314
It's his DAD!

22:32.480 --> 22:35.074
He wanted me to be his ears.

22:35.160 --> 22:37.913
Anything could have happened and we
wouldn't have known a thing about it.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.719
Do what the fuck you want,
just don't get him involved, OK?

22:40.800 --> 22:42.552
Why all the secrecy?
Why didn't you tell us?

22:42.640 --> 22:45.438
- He wanted me to keep it quiet.
- Hence the phone and cash.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.272
Every man has his price.

22:47.360 --> 22:49.999
- What's he saying?
- He just wanted to see his dad.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.719
I could have taken you.
Why the big secret?

22:52.800 --> 22:55.314
Don't ignore me.
Why the big fucking secret?

22:55.400 --> 22:57.550
- You're out of order!
- Maybe he's frightened.

22:57.640 --> 22:58.914
Wait till the coppers come around,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.355
wanting to know who it was
that beat up your old man.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.431
Then you'll know fucking frightened.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.080
- Pack it in!
- No, fuck you!

23:06.160 --> 23:08.958
- Come here! Listen to me, right?
- Lan!

23:09.040 --> 23:11.952
- What are you doing?
- He's someone else's kid, right?

23:12.040 --> 23:16.192
Keep your distance from now on.
You hear me? Keep your distance.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.397

27:19.480 --> 27:21.471
I'm sorry.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.073
I was bang out of order before.

27:24.440 --> 27:29.150
I have to give up someone I want,
someone I love,

27:29.240 --> 27:30.958
to be part of this.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.395
And I don't know if it's worth it.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.357
Is that what you've told him?

27:36.440 --> 27:38.635
I haven't told him anything.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.274
Maybe you should go and see him,

27:42.360 --> 27:44.874
explain yourself,
let him know where he stands.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.076
Let us all know where we stand.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.870
It's the eternal dilemma, innit?

27:55.960 --> 27:57.359
Head or heart?

28:00.240 --> 28:03.152
We're wired different, see,
men and women.

28:03.240 --> 28:06.630
Your hearts are wired to your heads.
Ours are wired further south.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.077
You know what he is.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.071
You know what to expect.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.798
He can change.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.440
What you see is what you get.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.919
And I like what I see.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.039
Most of the time.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.279
What about what she sees?

28:28.880 --> 28:30.871
Cos she will.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.632
One day.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.193
(Mandy) C'mon, Katie.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.996
I noticed your glass was empty.

28:50.080 --> 28:53.152
So, Mandy and Joe.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.196
What do we do?

28:55.280 --> 28:56.679
Nothing.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.398
We can't just let her
walk back to him.

28:58.480 --> 29:01.472
I know if I lay down the law,
give Mandy an ultimatum,

29:01.560 --> 29:03.949
she'll do exactly what I say.
She'll leave him.

29:04.040 --> 29:04.995
Result.

29:05.080 --> 29:08.436
Then she'll blame me for fucking up
her life. As time goes by,

29:08.520 --> 29:10.909
she'll forget
that Joe was a piece of shit

29:11.000 --> 29:14.390
and just remember that I was the one
insisted she left him.

29:15.960 --> 29:19.111
- Do you reckon she will leave him?
- I hope so.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.713
Cos if he touches her again,

29:20.800 --> 29:22.199
I'll kill him.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.990
I thought you might have
brought Katie in.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.396
I don't like her being in hospitals.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.357
She could catch anything.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.958
What I did...

29:54.960 --> 29:57.520
...it won't ever happen again.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.477
I know.

29:59.560 --> 30:04.918
<i>I made a mistake.
I took us...you for granted.</i>

30:07.120 --> 30:08.758
I was under pressure.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.400
And it all got on top. And it...

30:19.480 --> 30:22.119
- I love you.
- Why,

30:22.200 --> 30:23.838
when you could do so much better?

30:23.920 --> 30:27.356
Single mother. Low self-esteem.

30:27.440 --> 30:31.353
Well, I must have,
loving a man like you.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.429
I can change.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.238
Then you won't be the man
I fell in love with.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.790
Don't you see, Joe?
Whatever we do, we're fucked.

30:39.200 --> 30:43.193
But the sad thing is...
I could settle for that.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.871
I love you so much I'd risk it.

30:47.960 --> 30:50.952
I'd take all your promises
and believe the lot of them.

30:51.040 --> 30:54.794
Each and every time.
Slap after slap after slap.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.235
- I won't...
- I'd believe them.

30:57.320 --> 31:00.551
But I don't think Katie would.

31:00.640 --> 31:05.634
She'd get to an age where she'd sit me
down and ask me why I'd stayed.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.358
And how could I ever tell her

31:07.440 --> 31:09.749
that her mother
was willing to be a doormat...

31:11.120 --> 31:14.237
...just because she loved you?

32:11.360 --> 32:12.759
It's obvious you're not arsed,

32:12.840 --> 32:14.831
which is just as well,
cos I'm not either.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.912
I'm going back home. I don't know
where Danny is and I don't care.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.389
If you need someone
to look after him, you're his auntie.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.879

32:21.960 --> 32:23.359

Whoa! Fucking hell.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.195
Wha?

32:28.280 --> 32:30.794
She said he used to beat me!

32:30.880 --> 32:33.599
Said he battered me and my mam.

32:33.680 --> 32:36.717
<i>He did this.</i>

32:38.840 --> 32:40.717
You can talk.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.473
It's the only way
he could get you to listen.

32:44.560 --> 32:48.917
Danny texted me. He said he'd found
him. I got the first flight I could.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.518
Danny. Danny, you don't know
what your dad's like.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.113
He's dangerous.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.872
Look at me.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.757
Look at me!

32:59.840 --> 33:01.671
He almost killed you once.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.797
Let's not give him
a second chance, eh?

33:04.880 --> 33:06.598
He said that you were a liar.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.229
I told him what you said.
He said that you were a liar.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.834
Danny, why would she lie?

33:12.920 --> 33:14.478
He said you couldn't have kids.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.790
That you stole me from him
when Mum died.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.677
No. That is not true.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.830
Your mum begged me to take you.

33:20.920 --> 33:23.514
She begged me. To save you.

33:25.080 --> 33:28.197
Why don't you come with me to Spain?
We'll move.

33:28.280 --> 33:31.033
I'll sell the bar, yeah?

33:31.120 --> 33:34.954
He'll never find us. You won't
ever have to see him again.

33:39.840 --> 33:44.630
<i>(Peggy) Danny. Danny, why not?
What's stopping you?</i>

33:44.720 --> 33:47.109
<i>Agreed? Danny?</i>

33:47.200 --> 33:49.270
Agreed?

33:50.360 --> 33:51.952
Hey.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.078
Agreed?

33:58.840 --> 34:00.910
(lan) Peggy, I can be
out of this place by tonight.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.434
Keep it. It's yours.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.033
What?

34:05.120 --> 34:08.112
We won't be coming back, will we?

34:13.600 --> 34:16.989
LOUD RUMBLING

34:18.400 --> 34:20.630
(Paddy) Oh, mercy.

34:20.719 --> 34:24.315
Hypocrite! You let me down. Hypocrite!

34:24.400 --> 34:27.870
You have to be single...

34:30.480 --> 34:32.630
What do I do, Da?

34:38.040 --> 34:41.998
♪ Once upon a time
there was a tavern

34:43.639 --> 34:47.952
♪ Where we used to raise
a glass or two

34:49.040 --> 34:53.476
♪ Remember how we laughed away
the hours

34:54.600 --> 34:59.754
♪ And dreamed of
all the great things we would do... ♪

35:03.960 --> 35:08.351
I fell for her completely
but... she tricked me.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.035
Got me hooked on the gear.
Hung me out to dry.

35:12.120 --> 35:15.635
Cost me everything.

35:17.200 --> 35:22.035
The business,
the respect of my children,

35:22.120 --> 35:24.031
the love of my wife.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.118
CHOKES

35:28.200 --> 35:32.990
You're not going to be told
what to do by no man!

35:33.080 --> 35:35.355
And no woman.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.874
You are gonna kick the shit

35:37.960 --> 35:41.953
and reclaim what's yours,
no matter what it takes.

35:42.040 --> 35:47.478
Anyone gets in your way,
annihilate them.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.391
It's not that easy.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.999
Carry no passengers.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.879
Go.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.428
Not without you.

36:13.920 --> 36:16.673
Not without you.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.159
Go.

36:23.120 --> 36:26.749
You walked out before.
I lost you once.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.239
I don't want to lose you again.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.709
- Get out.
- Please, Daddy. Don't.

36:30.800 --> 36:35.112
I need you here.
Please, Daddy. Don't go.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.714
I said get out!

36:37.800 --> 36:39.199
No! No!

36:39.280 --> 36:42.317
SCREAMING

36:45.280 --> 36:47.032
EXPLOSION

36:47.120 --> 36:51.671
SCREAMS
Please, Daddy! No! No!

36:51.760 --> 36:53.432
No! No!

36:53.520 --> 36:55.715
- You can hear that from the street.
- He's possessed!

36:55.800 --> 36:57.870
Should we get a priest?
SCREAMING >

36:59.640 --> 37:01.551
SCREAMS

37:05.320 --> 37:06.799
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, THUMP!

37:06.880 --> 37:10.236
- Here's Johnny! Redrum!
- Here's Johnny! Redrum!

37:10.320 --> 37:11.548
- Shoot the fucker!
- Shoot the fucker!

37:11.640 --> 37:13.119
BANG!

37:13.200 --> 37:14.792
Ah, it's got me! It's got me!

37:17.120 --> 37:18.758
(Paddy) I can't do this!

37:18.840 --> 37:21.991
(Paddy's dad) You're a Maguire.
You have to.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.437
Mam banged up and you resenting me.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.795
It's the last thing
I wanted to happen.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.993
We're finished.

37:41.560 --> 37:45.075
- I'm sorry.
- You're fucking delighted.

37:45.160 --> 37:47.469
You deserve better from him and us.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.028
Whatever I can do,
you know where I am.

37:50.120 --> 37:53.874
Any more interfering in my life,
I'll walk.

37:53.960 --> 37:55.996
And you'll never see me again.
Understand?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.638
- Understand?
- I understand.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.438
You're not going up
to naughty knickers?

38:03.520 --> 38:06.114
No, sir. Katie's a bit young
for all that.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.591
- This doesn't get you off the hook.
- Yeah, I know.

38:11.680 --> 38:16.310
Pick her up from ours, yeah? Give you
a chance to say hello to everyone.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.238
As soon as your fella
sees you in them,

38:22.320 --> 38:24.595
he won't be running to the bedroom,
he'll be pole-vaulting.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.830
Soon as I get a fella,
I'll let you know.

38:26.920 --> 38:29.957
- If you're not fucking buying, then...
- I was having them.

38:30.040 --> 38:30.950
All right?

38:37.400 --> 38:39.436
You all right?

38:42.120 --> 38:43.872
I've not been
a very good mate lately.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.757
Nor me.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.398
But I'm here for you.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.550
Friendly, impartial advice.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.591
We're finished.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.398
What did he say?

38:56.480 --> 38:59.950
If you don't mind,
I'd sooner not talk about it.

39:00.040 --> 39:03.032
- What happened happened.
- Put it all behind us.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.792
- Exactly.
- Ladies,

39:05.880 --> 39:07.518
can I have your attention, please?

39:07.600 --> 39:09.750
I'd like to introduce
tonight's first two models,

39:09.840 --> 39:12.354
all the way from Lillian's,
Trixie and Rhianna.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.032
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:16.600 --> 39:18.750
Look at that,
not a natural fibre in sight.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.592
Fucking brilliant this, innit?

39:20.840 --> 39:23.718
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH UP STAIRS

39:24.800 --> 39:28.395
- Jamie, it's not safe.
- He's gone off his head.

39:28.480 --> 39:31.916
You open that door, he'll be head
spinning round, vomiting green soup,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.433
your mam sucking cocks in hell!

39:38.400 --> 39:39.992
I've got your arse covered, kid.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.716
SIGHS DEEPLY

40:12.680 --> 40:14.079
You look like shit.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.957
Felt better.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.593
I need a shower, shave,
clean clothes.

40:20.680 --> 40:23.148
- On the way.
- And a word with your mother.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.915
I'm over the worst, son.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.911
Hello, sweetheart.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.479
Hello.

40:33.560 --> 40:36.120
This should put a smile on your face.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.553
Thanks, son.

40:46.120 --> 40:49.078
- Back in business, huh?
- Yeah.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.111
Fucking hell.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.988
All right. Get that place cleaned -
the floors, the ceiling. Now.

41:04.080 --> 41:07.914
Both bra and panties have Velcro
side-fastenings for a quick release.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.560
Any man seeing this
on your wedding night will say...

41:10.640 --> 41:11.914
Fuck me, Meena!

41:12.000 --> 41:13.991
I wouldn't want to hear that
on my wedding night.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.798
- Selling yourself?
- Hypocrite!

41:15.880 --> 41:17.233
No worse than what you sell.

41:17.320 --> 41:20.551
- That is business.
- So is this.

41:32.080 --> 41:33.354
Peggy.

41:33.440 --> 41:34.873
Yeah?

41:34.960 --> 41:36.518
When you said his dad was dangerous,

41:36.600 --> 41:38.989
- it wasn't just to keep Danny away?
- No, why?

41:39.080 --> 41:41.514
Shit! Come on!

41:41.600 --> 41:42.555
Fuck!

41:44.200 --> 41:45.679
(Jamie) He's well over the worst.

41:45.760 --> 41:49.196
- So he did it? He's clean?
- As a whistle.

41:49.280 --> 41:51.714
And suddenly everything's all right?

41:51.800 --> 41:53.279
(Paddy) We've both made mistakes.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.999
If you can't admit that,
there's no way forward.

41:56.080 --> 41:59.231
I can't... and I won't

41:59.320 --> 42:02.153
take all the blame for everything
that's gone wrong with us, Mimi.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.470
It takes two to tango.

42:04.560 --> 42:07.438
God knows we've had
two left feet for years.

42:39.720 --> 42:42.439
Danny! Danny!

42:42.520 --> 42:46.991
I just want to talk to you. I just want
to talk to you. Listen! Listen!

42:47.080 --> 42:52.029
- I'm sorry. I should have listened.
- Danny, what are you doing? Wha?

42:52.120 --> 42:53.758
It's all right, Danny!

42:54.840 --> 42:56.034
OK.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.633
MOUTHS

42:57.720 --> 42:59.233
OK.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.788
But I don't think
I can face seeing him.

43:03.520 --> 43:05.272
Would you go with him?

43:14.480 --> 43:17.233
You've changed your attitude a bit
since I last saw you.

43:18.360 --> 43:19.793
He's got something to say.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.398
Why?

43:23.480 --> 43:25.357
- Why what?
- You did what you did.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.670
And what have they told you
I've done, Sean?

43:27.760 --> 43:29.034
Danny!

43:29.120 --> 43:31.839
When your mam and Auntie Peg
done a runner with you,

43:31.920 --> 43:35.674
you weren't Danny, you were Sean.
I gave you that name.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.671
And I'd like you to keep it.

43:37.760 --> 43:39.478
Why did you do it?

43:39.560 --> 43:41.357
What?

43:41.440 --> 43:43.396
- What lies have they fed you?
- Hit me!

43:43.480 --> 43:46.836
- Is that what they told you?
- You saying you didn't?

43:46.920 --> 43:49.514
I don't know what the fuck's
this got to do with you, but yeah.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.556
- You did this.
- No.

43:51.640 --> 43:54.393
- Beat me so bad, you did this.
- Sorry, son.

43:54.480 --> 43:56.072
Your mam's been feeding you
a load of crap.

43:56.160 --> 44:00.551
I remember - you hurting me. And you
hit him, the baby - you hit James!

44:00.640 --> 44:02.278
You fell for their lies,
hook, line and sinker.

44:02.360 --> 44:05.158
Won't let you do to him
what you did to me.

44:05.240 --> 44:08.994
Is that what all this is about, is it?
You clearing your conscience?

44:12.040 --> 44:14.634
- Took his little brother walkabout.
- To get him away from you.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.790
- Over two roads and across the park.
- To keep him safe!

44:16.880 --> 44:18.836
- Two miles they walked.
- Stop you hurting him!

44:18.920 --> 44:21.229
Took a shortcut by the millpond
and then...

44:21.320 --> 44:22.799
Never got the opportunity to ask,

44:22.880 --> 44:25.678
because you, your mother
and Auntie Peg just disappeared.

44:28.320 --> 44:29.958
What actually happened, Sean?

44:31.880 --> 44:33.313
Did he jump?

44:36.040 --> 44:37.109
Or was he drowned?

44:37.200 --> 44:38.599
You fucking bastard.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.752
You can't blame me
for what you did to him.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.558
I wanted to save him from you!

44:43.640 --> 44:45.392
You did this to me! You did this!

44:45.480 --> 44:49.632
Get out. Go on.
Fuck off back to Spain.
