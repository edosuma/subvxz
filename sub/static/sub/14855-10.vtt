00:10.795 --> 00:12.683
<i>My name is detective Brett Hopper,</i>

00:13.378 --> 00:15.593
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

00:16.027 --> 00:16.997
Put your hands up!

00:16.998 --> 00:19.857
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

00:19.858 --> 00:21.404
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

00:22.059 --> 00:23.660
Who the hell are you people?

00:24.031 --> 00:26.085
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

00:26.450 --> 00:29.517
<i>I know all this,
because I am living the same day...</i>

00:29.819 --> 00:31.273
<i>over and over again.</i>

00:31.367 --> 00:32.427
The day is the same

00:32.499 --> 00:34.131
but different things happen.

00:34.255 --> 00:35.662
<i>Everyday I get an another chance.</i>

00:35.663 --> 00:36.765
For every decision,

00:37.035 --> 00:37.998
there's a consequence.

00:38.638 --> 00:39.751
<i>I discovered an alliance</i>

00:39.752 --> 00:41.568
<i>between a city councilman
and street gangs.</i>

00:41.572 --> 00:44.027
A skinhead alliance
with the Latin Disciples.

00:44.028 --> 00:45.870
<i>An alliance that led to Garza's murder.</i>

00:45.879 --> 00:46.847
All brokered

00:47.229 --> 00:48.382
by councilman Booth

00:48.784 --> 00:50.042
and his little lap dog.

00:50.140 --> 00:53.291
<i>Turns out that Garza tried to send me
a fax the night he died.</i>

00:53.292 --> 00:54.511
<i>Miguel Dominguez?</i>

00:55.075 --> 00:56.836
<i>What would Garza send this to you?</i>

00:56.837 --> 00:58.688
He's been in Pelican Bay since 89.

00:58.689 --> 01:01.251
There's no way he could've killed
anyone in 91, let alone Garza.

01:01.252 --> 01:03.463
<i>So, somehow,
I've got to catch Dominguez</i>

01:03.784 --> 01:06.497
<i>and find the answers
that would clear my name.</i>

01:14.657 --> 01:16.123
Flying to San Francisco.

01:16.826 --> 01:17.801
Very romantic.

01:18.090 --> 01:19.355
San Francisco...

01:19.721 --> 01:20.682
you alone...

01:20.894 --> 01:23.148
First off, it's not even San Francisco.

01:23.496 --> 01:24.633
It's Pelican Bay.

01:25.220 --> 01:27.037
It's all the way out
of Nowhere Ville and

01:27.149 --> 01:30.030
believe me, the last thing it is,
is romantic.

01:30.106 --> 01:31.851
Do you know what a Supermax is?

01:31.852 --> 01:34.757
Sure, some big grocery store
where you buy things in bulk.

01:35.947 --> 01:37.649
Hello! I was married to a cop.

01:39.059 --> 01:42.382
Supermax is like a fortress of solitude
to violent offenders.

01:42.572 --> 01:43.630
You're right, well,

01:43.782 --> 01:46.178
I gotta go see this guy there,
Miguel Dominguez.

01:46.939 --> 01:49.600
He's serving five consecutive
life sentences for murder.

01:49.727 --> 01:51.024
Why do you have to go ?

01:51.910 --> 01:53.129
<i>Miguel Dominguez...</i>

01:54.317 --> 01:56.327
<i>Why would Garza send this to you?</i>

01:58.330 --> 01:59.979
This guy wants me to go see him.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.831
He's a key to this murder case
I'm working on.

02:03.991 --> 02:04.962
That's yours?

02:05.139 --> 02:06.382
That's okay, I got it.

02:09.473 --> 02:10.433
Hey.

02:11.342 --> 02:13.505
You know,
can I give you a call back?

02:13.759 --> 02:14.725
Who's that?

02:15.005 --> 02:16.033
It's just work.

02:17.987 --> 02:20.267
So, what time do you want me
to pick you up in the morning?

02:20.267 --> 02:21.230
I got that covered.

02:21.701 --> 02:22.879
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,

02:23.104 --> 02:26.074
I mean, if today is like the passed few,
by the time you wake up,

02:26.074 --> 02:27.070
I'll be back.

02:37.079 --> 02:38.331
- Excuse me...
- What?

02:38.932 --> 02:41.247
I'm hearing a sort of horrible clang.

02:42.197 --> 02:44.155
I think we should tell the captain
and turn back.

02:44.169 --> 02:47.036
Was this different from the clang
you heard just a couple of minutes ago ?

02:47.037 --> 02:48.000
This one sounds

02:48.801 --> 02:50.213
even more dangerous.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.745
I fly five days a week
all over the world.

02:53.021 --> 02:54.704
Airplanes are safer than cars.

02:55.829 --> 02:58.057
This is a silver gleaming death machine.

03:02.276 --> 03:03.651
It's nice talking to you, sir.

03:06.363 --> 03:07.699
So do you really travel that much?

03:07.700 --> 03:10.195
San Francisco, Seattle, Japan.

03:10.475 --> 03:11.917
Back to France next week.

03:12.309 --> 03:13.928
I've been to Paris twelve times.

03:13.929 --> 03:14.898
Sounds fun.

03:14.899 --> 03:16.572
Of course, I've only seen
the Eiffel tower

03:16.573 --> 03:17.692
from my hotel window.

03:17.693 --> 03:19.544
I keep saying I'm gonna go but,

03:20.507 --> 03:23.265
you know how it is,
every time it's the same thing.

03:23.787 --> 03:24.756
Tell me about it.

03:25.281 --> 03:27.139
Got to celebrate
my birthday twice though.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.016
'Cause of the international day line.
I'm on way back from Sydney.

03:30.017 --> 03:31.666
Today what day is it in Australia?

03:31.831 --> 03:32.797
Well, see,

03:32.932 --> 03:35.333
seventeen hours ahead,
so that would make it...

03:35.370 --> 03:36.354
Tomorrow.

03:36.505 --> 03:37.807
Yeah, I guess it would.

03:38.642 --> 03:40.084
I wish I could get there.

03:40.593 --> 03:42.570
- Where? Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

03:44.019 --> 03:46.207
Seems like today is going pretty well.

03:47.469 --> 03:49.557
You gotta live for the moment, right ?

03:49.797 --> 03:50.841
Yeah.

03:55.391 --> 03:56.374
Yeah, it's what...

03:56.504 --> 03:58.277
my girlfriend keeps telling me.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.154
Lucky girl.

04:13.843 --> 04:15.692
Excuse me, does he even know
that I'm here ?

04:15.693 --> 04:17.892
You don't have an appointment,
Detective.

04:17.779 --> 04:18.892
You'll have to wait.

04:18.894 --> 04:21.466
Yes ma'am, I've been waiting
for three hours.

04:21.886 --> 04:22.864
Detective...

04:23.092 --> 04:24.596
Shelten, is it?

04:24.895 --> 04:25.996
Yes, Chad Shelten.

04:27.123 --> 04:28.108
Come on.

04:29.191 --> 04:32.415
You understand that I can't just stop
my day because you drop in.

04:32.416 --> 04:35.326
I appreciate you seeing me,
I won't take you up much of your time.

04:35.327 --> 04:37.266
I need to speak
with one of your prisoners,

04:37.267 --> 04:38.455
Miguel Dominguez.

04:42.562 --> 04:45.089
I'm afraid I can't accommodate that,
Detective.

04:45.090 --> 04:48.240
An assistant D.A. was murdered
last night in Los Angeles.

04:48.241 --> 04:50.593
Dominguez may have
some information on the killer.

04:50.594 --> 04:54.523
A man who spent the last 17 years
in prison would have information

04:54.524 --> 04:56.220
on a murder that happened last night?

04:56.221 --> 04:57.440
I realize how that may sound...

04:57.441 --> 04:59.408
I'm afraid you come at a bad time,
Detective.

04:59.409 --> 05:01.257
Dominguez shanked a guard
a few days ago.

05:01.258 --> 05:05.308
That's his third incident this year
and we put him in solitary confinement.

05:05.309 --> 05:06.278
No visitors.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.530
No exceptions.

05:07.531 --> 05:09.015
I really need to speak with him.

05:09.106 --> 05:10.074
I'm sorry.

05:10.075 --> 05:11.522
- Five minutes.
- Detective.

05:12.418 --> 05:14.437
You've come a long way for nothing.

05:17.896 --> 05:18.866
Yes.

05:19.315 --> 05:22.096
Bob Nedgo,
I have Mr. Detweiler returning.

05:22.527 --> 05:23.771
<i>For every decision,</i>

05:24.617 --> 05:25.692
<i>there's a consequence.</i>

05:28.732 --> 05:30.715
Good luck with your case, Detective.

05:31.371 --> 05:32.331
See you soon.

05:45.923 --> 05:47.155
Everything is gonna be fine.

05:47.156 --> 05:49.003
Nothing's gonna happen to this plane.

05:49.004 --> 05:49.987
How do you know?

05:50.894 --> 05:52.451
Because my day is repeating.

05:52.452 --> 05:55.267
I was here yesterday
and this plane doesn't crash.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.145
I watch TV.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.880
Planes crash all the time.

06:00.374 --> 06:02.144
So, if your day is repeating...

06:02.675 --> 06:04.208
What do you know about me?

06:12.993 --> 06:14.962
I hope we didn't keep you
waiting too long.

06:14.963 --> 06:16.624
Detective Shelten, is it?

06:16.742 --> 06:17.712
Yeah.

06:18.550 --> 06:19.519
And...

06:21.281 --> 06:22.434
Detweiler sent you?

06:25.376 --> 06:27.000
If you don't mind me asking,

06:27.001 --> 06:28.874
what exactly is your association
with him?

06:28.875 --> 06:30.369
We share a common interest.

06:31.503 --> 06:33.099
And he sent you here for me?

06:33.100 --> 06:35.340
Relax, he just wants to know
what happened with the guard

06:35.341 --> 06:36.375
that Dominguez shanked.

06:36.376 --> 06:37.633
That's being handled.

06:37.634 --> 06:39.247
I sort of promised I'd talk to him.

06:39.248 --> 06:40.323
See what went down.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.786
You want to talk to Dominguez?

06:44.787 --> 06:47.133
Detweiler wants to know
the whole story.

06:51.034 --> 06:52.477
Get the hell out of my office.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.924
He's not gonna be too pleased
with you filling me out like this.

06:54.925 --> 06:55.894
Who? Detweiler?

06:56.077 --> 06:57.872
Detweiler didn't send you here.

07:01.985 --> 07:03.551
Mr. Parrison, get a guard in here

07:03.552 --> 07:06.013
to escort this gentleman
off the facility.

07:16.442 --> 07:18.966
Hey man, why don't you take this?
It'll help you relax.

07:19.393 --> 07:20.364
Thanks.

07:20.643 --> 07:21.672
Mister Pusherman.

07:22.186 --> 07:23.359
But I'll just say no.

07:23.832 --> 07:24.993
I'm a police officer.

07:25.438 --> 07:26.435
Narcotics Unit.

07:26.801 --> 07:29.251
This is a prescription med,
it helps relieve anxiety.

07:29.812 --> 07:30.783
You're gonna take this,

07:30.784 --> 07:33.669
and you're gonna stop moaning about
how unsafe you think the plane is.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.832
You're scaring the others passengers.

07:38.441 --> 07:39.410
Take it.

07:41.352 --> 07:42.396
Okay, thank you.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.369
And, the next time you're in Paris,

07:47.717 --> 07:49.636
you should visit the Eiffel tower.

07:50.903 --> 07:51.886
Don't wait.

07:58.965 --> 08:00.326
So, Detweiler sent you?

08:00.327 --> 08:02.809
Told me to get up here
as soon as I could.

08:03.976 --> 08:05.776
You don't mind me asking what...

08:06.375 --> 08:08.222
what exactly is your association
with him?

08:08.223 --> 08:09.940
Fencik and Buchatler were busy.

08:12.193 --> 08:13.843
Listen, I'm not here to bust your hump.

08:13.844 --> 08:17.455
Detweiler is just a little concerned
about this Dominguez situation.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.012
Well, I already spoke to him about it.

08:19.013 --> 08:20.307
Come on, you know how he gets.

08:20.759 --> 08:22.541
Always telling everybody how...

08:22.585 --> 08:23.981
serious he is.

08:24.936 --> 08:27.691
I told him we shouldn’t put Dominguez
in Gen Pop.

08:27.692 --> 08:29.587
Now he's upset
that there is a price to pay.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.278
Well, he's a tough guy to work for.

08:31.279 --> 08:32.238
Don't I know it...

08:32.410 --> 08:35.373
I've spent 12 years under that man
since the time when he was a warden.

08:35.736 --> 08:38.381
I swear to God, if I never hear
those two words again...

08:38.462 --> 08:39.514
Decision...

08:39.779 --> 08:41.043
Consequence.

08:47.867 --> 08:49.571
So, what do you need from me?

08:50.845 --> 08:52.195
You've got five minutes.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.735
Where the hell are you?

09:23.077 --> 09:23.940
+

09:32.978 --> 09:34.384
Some wrong with the food?

09:39.713 --> 09:41.357
Another guy in a tub.

09:42.308 --> 09:44.247
I staked that place out for a week.

09:44.639 --> 09:48.002
- Never once was that guy...
- So you did what you have to do.

09:48.006 --> 09:49.335
Yeah, well, feels...

09:50.874 --> 09:51.860
Unprofessional.

09:52.822 --> 09:55.811
Unprofessional is yapping
about it all morning.

09:56.815 --> 09:59.848
There bigger problem than
some guy flowed in his tub.

10:00.232 --> 10:02.906
- What? The GPS thing?
- Yeah, the GPS thing.

10:02.951 --> 10:04.657
How we're gonna find Hopper without it?

10:04.713 --> 10:05.707
Call some favors.

10:06.084 --> 10:08.181
OK, think your guys can help us out?

10:10.867 --> 10:14.152
We're cruising brown town looking for
that gang banger from the safe house.

10:15.034 --> 10:15.995
Great.

10:17.287 --> 10:21.245
This job is a lot easier now.
All we've to do is take out the trash.

10:21.730 --> 10:23.425
Slow down, you're gonna choke.

10:24.544 --> 10:26.309
When is the last time you ate?

10:27.421 --> 10:30.192
Couldn't say.
Did you bring the Dominguez file?

10:37.119 --> 10:38.116
OK, I'll buy it.

10:38.922 --> 10:41.793
Why are you looking at a guy
who's been in lock-up for 17 years?

10:41.847 --> 10:43.183
I think he killed Garza.

10:48.521 --> 10:50.660
Hopper, the only thing
this guy is killing is time.

10:50.661 --> 10:52.160
They call him "El Llorón".

10:52.558 --> 10:53.519
The Crying Man.

10:53.805 --> 10:55.824
They say he's a ghost.
He can walk the walls,

10:55.825 --> 10:57.828
he sees everything, hears everything.

10:58.318 --> 10:59.587
Even though he's in locked up,

10:59.588 --> 11:01.967
people fear him
like he's the Boogie Man.

11:02.734 --> 11:03.732
What's he in for?

11:04.107 --> 11:06.573
Killed his whole family.
Both parents, kid sister.

11:06.574 --> 11:08.307
They found him covered in blood,

11:08.308 --> 11:11.471
at the breakfast table,
just sitting, eating his cereal.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.689
OK, he's a psychopath.

11:15.427 --> 11:18.588
But this guy's on ice in Pelican Bay.
Even ghost don't get over there.

11:18.589 --> 11:21.448
That's what I thought, but the magic
trick isn't walking through walls.

11:21.449 --> 11:22.967
He's left to the back door.

11:24.390 --> 11:26.551
You're telling me
somebody let this guy out of prison?

11:26.552 --> 11:27.527
Yeah.

11:27.881 --> 11:29.570
I've a CI, Damien Ortiz,

11:29.975 --> 11:32.050
he's about
to testify about contract killings

11:32.051 --> 11:34.129
within the Latin Disciples.

11:35.188 --> 11:38.884
Now I think that LDs are using
Dominguez to do all the dirty work.

11:39.374 --> 11:41.684
But why go through all of this trouble?

11:41.743 --> 11:44.220
The streets are full of bangers
who whack their best friends

11:44.221 --> 11:45.676
for a c-note or an 8-ball.

11:45.677 --> 11:46.940
It's the perfect alibi.

11:47.456 --> 11:51.494
If he's behind bars, there's no way
he could possibly pull the trigger.

11:51.497 --> 11:54.387
OK, suppose it's true.
How you're gonna prove it?

11:58.071 --> 11:59.033
OK, what do you need?

11:59.059 --> 12:02.596
I need you to look into unsolved
homicides over the passed 17 years.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.678
MO : one shot to the head,
two to the body.

12:04.679 --> 12:05.715
Execution style.

12:06.177 --> 12:07.579
Same way Garza went down.

12:07.776 --> 12:10.570
Go see Detective Choi
at Robbery/Homicide. He'll listen.

12:11.111 --> 12:13.837
See if Dominguez left prints
at any of the crime scenes.

12:13.838 --> 12:15.884
But if this Dominguez guy
is as good as you say he's,

12:15.885 --> 12:17.857
you think he'd be
careless enough to leave a print?

12:17.858 --> 12:20.565
Yeah, he did it before. He killed
this girl named Isabelle Contreras.

12:20.566 --> 12:23.136
He left one there. Of course,
he could just be taunting the police,

12:23.137 --> 12:24.721
telling us he can't be caught.

12:24.748 --> 12:25.851
But you're gonna try anyway?

12:25.852 --> 12:28.153
Yeah, I'm being framed
for a murder he committed.

12:28.154 --> 12:29.277
I gotta to find him.

12:29.278 --> 12:31.531
You said it, this guy's a ghost.
How you're gonna do that?

12:31.532 --> 12:33.423
By getting my informer to inform.

12:35.267 --> 12:37.204
You pull me out of my niece's birthday
for this ?

12:37.205 --> 12:39.183
I'll ask them
to save you a piece of birthday cake.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.189
No, man.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.291
I'm not doing this. We're through, Hop!

12:42.292 --> 12:44.809
I know that the LDs
are into murder for hire.

12:46.146 --> 12:48.667
I also know that's why Baxter
and the feds want you to testify.

12:48.668 --> 12:51.246
- How the hell you know that ?
- You were gonna give my name ?

12:51.247 --> 12:54.280
Louis Torrez.
He's the one who's running all the hits.

12:54.628 --> 12:56.371
This bastard thinks
he can pull on our faces,

12:56.372 --> 12:58.065
he's soon no smaller than a gang banger ?

12:58.073 --> 12:59.916
He's sailing his own disciples
down the river.

12:59.929 --> 13:01.828
- You want him ?
- He's protected, Hop !

13:02.011 --> 13:04.302
- He's connected...
- To a councilman named Tobias Booth.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.233
Yeah, I know. He's going down too.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.988
Look at you,
Detective Hopper with the 411.

13:11.150 --> 13:12.443
Alright. I'm listening.

13:12.690 --> 13:15.369
You can get Torrez
after I get what I need from him.

13:15.421 --> 13:16.732
Oh yeah ! What's that ?

13:17.108 --> 13:18.077
<i>El Llorón.</i>

13:21.536 --> 13:22.505
Use the front.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.379
- What ?
- He's the LDs secret weapon.

13:28.380 --> 13:29.830
Torrez is the dispatcher.

13:29.901 --> 13:32.164
Someone orders a hit,
Torrez makes the call,

13:32.220 --> 13:34.556
El Llorón pulls out,
he's got a "out of the jail" free card.

13:34.557 --> 13:36.178
You didn't know that, did you ?

13:36.179 --> 13:37.297
Not about El Llorón.

13:39.217 --> 13:41.603
- I'd stay clear...
- I gotta have him.

13:43.024 --> 13:44.010
The Crying Man.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.162
If this whole thing goes down
the way I think,

13:47.163 --> 13:48.279
we could pull them all away.

13:48.358 --> 13:50.309
Torrez, Booth, even El Llorón.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.154
- So they do a couple of years?
- No, we pull them away for good.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.038
Call the feds, whoever we need.

13:55.597 --> 13:58.798
That's gonna leave a lot more room
at the top of the LD food chain.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.424
New for an entrepreneur.

14:01.079 --> 14:02.416
A young man with vision.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.323
I know a guy like that.

14:05.431 --> 14:07.919
<i>Let me introduce one of
the greatest success stories</i>

14:08.133 --> 14:09.743
of our anti gang initiative.

14:09.834 --> 14:14.110
Louis Torrez joined
the Latin Disciples at the age of 14.

14:14.286 --> 14:17.376
Today, Louis is the key contributor
to this community, a member of...

14:27.710 --> 14:29.173
Oh, yeah! <i>Vato</i>!

14:29.621 --> 14:32.448
You think anyone believes that crap
about you leaving that life behind?

14:32.449 --> 14:33.994
How would you believe what I say?

14:34.701 --> 14:35.998
I don't buy it either.

14:38.522 --> 14:40.852
Andrea Battle.
I'm looking for Detective Choi.

14:40.853 --> 14:42.626
Battle?
Hopper's partner?

14:43.545 --> 14:45.730
Spivak, I'm in charge
of the Garza murder.

14:45.845 --> 14:47.794
Anything you have to say to Choi,
you say to me.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.843
I need to look through your files
on cold case murders.

14:51.844 --> 14:54.886
Anything that went down execution style
in the last 17 years.

14:54.886 --> 14:56.563
Execution style, that's good.

14:57.138 --> 14:58.100
What?

14:58.101 --> 14:59.736
I admire what you do
to help your partner,

14:59.737 --> 15:01.320
but you might have just deep-sixed him.

15:02.496 --> 15:03.670
Really? How's that?

15:04.095 --> 15:07.507
Garza was killed execution style,
but we didn't release that information.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.856
Other than detectives of the scene,

15:08.857 --> 15:11.071
the only other person that knew
that little detail

15:11.072 --> 15:12.031
is the killer.

15:12.970 --> 15:14.318
See, that's the problem.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.962
'Cause I happen to know
Brett Hopper didn't kill anyone.

15:16.963 --> 15:17.926
Great.

15:18.235 --> 15:19.941
Have him come in
and tell someone about it.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.365
You play ball.

15:24.268 --> 15:26.345
I let you pull all the cases you want.

15:27.408 --> 15:28.582
I have a better idea.

15:29.378 --> 15:32.679
I pull the cases that I want,
you play ball with yourself.

15:46.736 --> 15:47.701
Easy!

15:49.356 --> 15:50.863
What we're gonna to do is real simple.

15:50.864 --> 15:53.486
You tell me where El Llorón is,
you walk away.

15:53.513 --> 15:56.517
You don't, I walk away,
and I leave you with Damien.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.128
- I don't know what you talking about.
- Stop it!

16:01.129 --> 16:04.101
I know he escaped from prison,
I know he killed Garza,

16:05.086 --> 16:06.714
and I know you know
where the hell he is.

16:06.715 --> 16:07.684
You're mistaken.

16:08.227 --> 16:09.848
I work for councilman Booth!

16:09.849 --> 16:12.281
At least the Latin Disciples
had more respect for who they are.

16:12.282 --> 16:13.613
I left that life behind.

16:14.951 --> 16:17.507
You can lie, <i>ese</i>, but you ain't done

16:19.900 --> 16:21.018
Let me just talked to him!

16:21.285 --> 16:22.422
<i>Vamo!</i>

16:22.985 --> 16:24.821
I got this. Easy, easy.

16:28.168 --> 16:29.127
Son of a bitch.

16:31.051 --> 16:33.390
You're gonna have to get
that little tattoo removed?

16:33.391 --> 16:35.047
You're gonna rip him off
or make him talk?

16:35.048 --> 16:36.041
Shut up! I'm still a cop.

16:36.042 --> 16:37.001
Yeah, shut up!

16:39.754 --> 16:40.713
What is this?

16:44.330 --> 16:45.426
Whose address is this?

16:45.503 --> 16:47.510
That?
That's <i>muy importante.</i>

16:48.021 --> 16:49.779
That's where I hook up
with Damien's mother.

16:51.063 --> 16:52.042
Come on!

16:52.043 --> 16:53.224
- Come on.
- Come on! <i>Vamo!</i>

16:53.225 --> 16:55.331
- You know what they call you?
- Think I give a damn?

16:55.332 --> 16:58.131
- You wanna me say why we call you LD?
- What?

16:58.597 --> 16:59.887
- What?
- <i>La Dama!</i>

17:00.061 --> 17:01.123
The woman !

17:01.966 --> 17:02.925
I'm cool, Hop.

17:03.366 --> 17:04.911
- I'm cool, right?
- Right?

17:05.718 --> 17:07.366
- I'm good.
- Yeah, run away!

17:07.893 --> 17:08.852
You think it's...

17:10.791 --> 17:12.532
Who the hell's gonna know, <i>cabrón?</i>

17:12.911 --> 17:13.922
Who's running?

17:18.472 --> 17:19.431
We are.

17:20.425 --> 17:20.866
+

17:27.166 --> 17:28.126
Wait!

17:28.239 --> 17:29.922
You gotta tell me about Dominguez.

17:29.923 --> 17:30.882
<i>El Llorón...</i>

17:34.124 --> 17:35.083
He's not the...

17:36.499 --> 17:37.459
What?

17:39.324 --> 17:40.290
Torrez!

17:49.323 --> 17:50.449
What the hell did you do?

17:50.450 --> 17:51.888
Watch it, Hop! Watch it!

17:53.084 --> 17:54.489
You did it again!

17:55.640 --> 17:58.790
- I knew I couldn't trust you.
- What the hell are you talking about?

17:58.791 --> 18:00.727
You say I wouldn't play bad cop for you?

18:00.874 --> 18:02.845
I came here to get my note! Got it?

18:03.717 --> 18:05.089
You got a problem with that?

18:05.090 --> 18:07.370
You could lay down
right next to that bitch!

18:08.852 --> 18:09.954
What are you doing?

18:10.318 --> 18:12.986
What do you think?
You think I'm gonna stay here?

18:12.987 --> 18:14.495
I'm getting the hell out of here, Hop.

18:14.496 --> 18:15.455
You should too.

18:28.319 --> 18:29.282
Spivak!

18:29.283 --> 18:31.028
Detective Battle?
You found me a happy end?

18:31.029 --> 18:32.282
No, but I found these.

18:32.876 --> 18:35.273
Two cold case hits match
and the same MO as Garza:

18:35.283 --> 18:37.084
One to the head, two to the chest.

18:37.085 --> 18:40.334
And both crime scenes
had errant prints
belonging to one guy.

18:41.139 --> 18:42.737
Miguel Dominguez, who's that?

18:43.084 --> 18:44.043
Garza's killer.

18:46.024 --> 18:48.363
Hold on, this guy was in prison
when the murder was committed.

18:48.364 --> 18:51.085
Listen. I know what I'm suggesting
might sound a little...

18:51.086 --> 18:52.475
- Insane?
- Implausible.

18:53.994 --> 18:54.953
It's Dominguez.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.142
We just need to find an errant print
from the Garza scene.

18:58.143 --> 19:00.396
Oh, we've got an errant print...
On the gun.

19:00.458 --> 19:01.659
It belongs to Hopper.

19:02.029 --> 19:03.307
I don't know your partner, but...

19:03.718 --> 19:04.678
He's our guy.

19:04.979 --> 19:06.297
I wanna recheck the gun.

19:06.298 --> 19:08.640
- You're reaching, Battle.
- Then let me reach!

19:08.641 --> 19:10.186
It's how we found Hoffa right ?

19:12.858 --> 19:15.196
Beneath the gold post at the metal ends.

19:18.848 --> 19:21.031
I need to see the gun
from the Garza murder.

19:21.186 --> 19:22.577
You're the IO?

19:22.771 --> 19:24.393
- Not but I...
- I am.

19:25.961 --> 19:27.105
Do what she wants.

19:27.970 --> 19:29.600
Ok, just give me a second.

19:38.756 --> 19:39.954
We don't have the gun.

19:40.737 --> 19:41.989
What do you mean?

19:42.470 --> 19:43.515
It's been checked out.

19:43.632 --> 19:44.694
Checked out by who?

19:45.928 --> 19:47.450
Detective... Spyvak.

19:48.342 --> 19:49.548
I'm Spyvak!

20:11.607 --> 20:13.796
- Yeah.
- I'm Detective Brett Hopper.

20:14.165 --> 20:17.289
I'm conducting a police investigation.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

20:17.398 --> 20:19.667
My cousin has one of those
and he ain't a real cop.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.126
Show me something else.

20:31.450 --> 20:34.201
- What do you want, Brett Hopper?
- May I come in?

20:43.999 --> 20:45.863
Miss Zapanta, you live here by yourself?

20:45.917 --> 20:47.753
Alma. Yeah, just me.

21:00.115 --> 21:02.060
Do you know a man named Louis Torrez?

21:03.001 --> 21:04.023
Tobias Booth?

21:04.401 --> 21:05.873
Doesn't sound like my flavor.

21:05.937 --> 21:07.549
What about Miguel Dominguez?

21:07.845 --> 21:09.314
I don't know, I don't think so.

21:09.371 --> 21:11.334
You don't know
or you just don't remember.

21:11.506 --> 21:14.369
Men in my life come and go,
I don't know who's got a name.

21:15.758 --> 21:17.208
What is this really about?

21:17.506 --> 21:19.622
I found your address in a man's wallet.

21:20.216 --> 21:22.720
Louis Torrez.
I think you may be in danger.

21:24.953 --> 21:26.639
Maybe he just wanted to buy a painting.

21:26.692 --> 21:29.898
Well, I have reason believe he is
a dispatcher for a contract killer.

21:30.042 --> 21:31.230
He had your address.

21:31.393 --> 21:34.441
- You could be his next target.
- Why would anybody wanna kill me?

21:41.891 --> 21:42.936
Excuse me.

21:47.579 --> 21:49.380
- Andrea, what did you get?
- You were right.

21:49.614 --> 21:51.983
I've found Dominguez's prints
on two other crime scenes.

21:52.163 --> 21:53.334
But not at Garza's.

21:53.451 --> 21:56.395
- What ? Did you recheck the gun ?
- I tried: only one problem.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.342
- It's gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?

21:59.648 --> 22:01.683
Chain of evidence says
Spyvak signed out.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.936
But I was with him,
I'm telling you he had no idea.

22:04.132 --> 22:06.978
Alright, it means I gotta go back
tomorrow and get the gun.

22:07.401 --> 22:08.572
What are you talking about?

22:09.229 --> 22:10.192
Thanks.

22:10.561 --> 22:11.840
I gotta stop doing that.

22:14.207 --> 22:17.404
Miss Zapanta, is there anyone
that you think would wanna harm you?

22:17.922 --> 22:19.039
Yeah.

22:19.886 --> 22:20.869
But they're dead.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.381
What do you mean?

22:25.020 --> 22:26.983
I can take care of myself, detective.

22:27.236 --> 22:29.486
Why don't you find someone else to save?

22:49.602 --> 22:50.565
Hey, it's me.

22:50.955 --> 22:52.765
Thank God. I've been so worried.

22:52.837 --> 22:54.962
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry I haven't had time to...

22:55.167 --> 22:57.289
call you today.
I just want to make sure you're okay.

22:57.290 --> 22:59.555
<i>- make sure you were safe.</i>
- I'm fine why wouldn't I be?

22:59.830 --> 23:02.414
I know you've been hearing
a lot of crazy things about me today

23:02.496 --> 23:04.650
You need to know,
I'm trying to clear my name.

23:05.388 --> 23:06.811
What's going on? Where are you?

23:07.018 --> 23:10.125
I'm waiting for this guy,
Miguel Dominguez.

23:10.233 --> 23:11.836
Sorry I can't tell you more.

23:12.259 --> 23:13.276
Are you with Chad?

23:13.978 --> 23:15.969
Yeah. How did you know?

23:16.081 --> 23:17.189
It doesn't matter, just...

23:17.567 --> 23:19.062
stay with him tonight, OK?

23:19.453 --> 23:20.416
Okay.

23:20.714 --> 23:21.723
I see you tomorrow.

23:22.029 --> 23:24.460
Alright baby? I promise,
I see you tomorrow.

23:28.045 --> 23:29.017
Hopper?

23:29.359 --> 23:31.062
- Yeah.
- What did he say?

23:32.367 --> 23:33.934
That I should stay here with you.

23:34.303 --> 23:35.276
Really?

23:36.131 --> 23:37.788
You've got a hell of a tasted man.

23:46.578 --> 23:47.893
Where do you keep the blankets?

23:48.334 --> 23:49.317
Hall closet.

23:54.739 --> 23:55.756
Everything okay?

23:55.828 --> 23:58.359
Yeah, one of my bulbs burned out.

23:58.931 --> 24:00.354
Where do you keep spares?

24:00.839 --> 24:01.833
In the kitchen.

24:11.295 --> 24:12.138
+

24:22.701 --> 24:23.683
Hey! Morning.

24:29.406 --> 24:31.383
You're in a good mood, this morning.

24:32.515 --> 24:34.736
There's this murder case
I've been trying to close off.

24:35.429 --> 24:37.117
Trying to put behind me and...

24:37.411 --> 24:39.586
- They got finally got a handle on it.
- Really?

24:40.117 --> 24:42.660
Yeah, Andrea came up
with some evidence

24:43.111 --> 24:45.493
that kinda support this theory
I got going on, so...

24:45.833 --> 24:47.108
That's great news.

24:47.675 --> 24:49.621
I still have to catch the guy, but...

24:49.634 --> 24:52.098
- We should celebrate.
- OK.

24:53.700 --> 24:54.670
Tonight.

24:58.524 --> 25:01.315
- Unless you wanna...
- Unless I wanna what?

25:02.855 --> 25:04.060
Unless I wanna what?

25:08.098 --> 25:10.929
No, I gotta go to the house
and see what's up to Rambis,

25:10.930 --> 25:14.658
I gotta get this gun, maybe...
get it print in.

25:15.248 --> 25:17.484
I got this stuff too... I'm rather busy.

25:19.279 --> 25:22.033
Zapanta. Z-A-P-A-N-T-A.

25:22.255 --> 25:26.148
First name : Alma.
2216 Moulton Avenue.

25:26.463 --> 25:27.520
- <i>Got that?</i>
- Yeah.

25:28.149 --> 25:30.566
- What's so important about this girl?
- She may be the target

25:30.567 --> 25:31.702
of a contract killing.

25:31.703 --> 25:33.306
<i>Anything you can find will be helpful.</i>

25:33.307 --> 25:35.201
I'll look into it.
Did you get the gun yet?

25:35.202 --> 25:36.855
I'm on the way to my apartment
right now.

25:36.856 --> 25:39.579
Had to help... Rita... with some stuff.

25:39.965 --> 25:42.717
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

25:43.085 --> 25:46.204
I've got IA at 11a.m.
Don't let your stuff make me late.

26:05.245 --> 26:07.172
Hey, buddy.
What's up?

26:07.911 --> 26:09.249
Want some treats?

26:29.445 --> 26:30.625
Let's go!

26:40.732 --> 26:43.065
Hey, Mr. Hopper!
Your apartment has a leak.

26:43.066 --> 26:44.820
I know, I was just coming up
to investigate.

26:44.821 --> 26:46.400
No problem, I'll tell the plumbers.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.936
- What you doing Mr. Hopper?
- Shut up!

26:56.902 --> 27:00.427
Very bad. He was not supposed
to move in here for a week.

27:00.533 --> 27:02.905
- Who?
- The new tenant, Mr. Jarvik.

27:03.295 --> 27:04.697
I should charge him for this.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.861
They were running surveillance on me.

27:09.704 --> 27:12.694
Mr. Zeitoun, these plumbers-- were they
two of them? Tall white dudes?

27:12.718 --> 27:13.937
- Dark jackets?
- Yes.

27:14.264 --> 27:17.201
Why would they do this?
I just painted these walls.

27:35.853 --> 27:37.217
Upstairs. Move!

27:38.554 --> 27:39.551
It's Jarvik.

27:40.206 --> 27:42.460
He must have come in here
to clean and surprised them.

27:42.461 --> 27:43.457
Them? Who is “them”?

27:44.864 --> 27:47.891
The men that you saw weren't plumbers.
Their names are Fencik and Buchalter.

27:47.892 --> 27:50.041
They're parked across the street
in a blue Sedan.

27:50.041 --> 27:51.037
They killed him.

27:51.653 --> 27:52.649
Police! Open up!

27:53.514 --> 27:54.680
What's.. What are you doing?

27:54.681 --> 27:56.226
Open the door and don't let them in.

27:56.227 --> 27:58.311
- Why?
- Don't let them in, I'm the police.

27:58.312 --> 27:59.281
Don't let in!

28:04.613 --> 28:06.395
Heard some yelling.
Is everything alright?

28:06.396 --> 28:08.468
Yes, everything is fine, no problem.

28:09.424 --> 28:11.220
Have you seen your tenant
from downstairs?

28:11.221 --> 28:12.543
Yes, absolutely... No.

28:13.048 --> 28:14.739
- Have you seen him or not?
- He was here,

28:14.740 --> 28:17.262
- but no, he's not... There is leak!
- Where's Hopper?

28:17.354 --> 28:19.090
- Where is he?
- I think he's taking care

28:19.091 --> 28:20.199
of the dead man in the tub.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.144
Blue Jay, what's your status?

28:27.901 --> 28:29.867
Blue Jay! No sign of Hopper, sir.

28:36.660 --> 28:38.299
You and me, we're gonna talk.

28:39.147 --> 28:39.670
+

28:47.597 --> 28:48.566
Tacos, uh?

28:50.310 --> 28:53.015
- Breakfast of champions.
- I'm out for a run this morning.

28:53.081 --> 28:54.759
- Worked up an appetite.
- I know.

28:55.283 --> 28:57.255
Not many people actually outrun SWAT.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.954
The gun's in there.

29:09.935 --> 29:11.549
I don't even wanna know
how you got this.

29:11.550 --> 29:12.915
They planted it in my apartment.

29:12.916 --> 29:15.486
They're gonna try and tell
the prints on it are mine.

29:15.551 --> 29:18.028
I've a feeling the real killer left it
as a calling card.

29:18.212 --> 29:19.477
I'm running down this ID.

29:19.478 --> 29:22.318
Say you got it from a drug bust or some,
don't say you got it for me.

29:22.344 --> 29:25.214
- And don't let it out of your sight.
- You think someone'd tamper with it?

29:25.254 --> 29:26.845
Think it might get up and walk away.

29:27.632 --> 29:30.083
So I ran a background on Alma Zapanta

29:30.084 --> 29:31.879
No prior, just got speeding tickets.

29:31.919 --> 29:33.400
There's gotta be something.

29:33.412 --> 29:35.851
There is one thing.
I checked with the county records

29:35.852 --> 29:38.066
and apparently she grew up
in foster care.

29:38.067 --> 29:40.451
Horrible story.
The parents were murdered.

29:40.583 --> 29:42.549
Ever found the guy who did it?

29:43.007 --> 29:44.463
It was her brother.

29:44.464 --> 29:46.534
He almost killed her
after he got the parents.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.133
Wait, Zapanta?

29:48.448 --> 29:49.450
Is that her real name?

29:49.477 --> 29:51.508
No. Birth name was Dominguez, why?

29:54.143 --> 29:55.244
Alma Dominguez.

29:56.357 --> 29:57.813
She's El Llorón's sister.

30:00.617 --> 30:02.439
Are you ready Mr. Zeitoun?

30:05.795 --> 30:07.118
Everybody face forward.

30:14.155 --> 30:16.094
Do you recognize any of these men?

30:19.489 --> 30:21.115
Those men.
Those two.

30:21.363 --> 30:22.739
Numbers three and six.

30:22.740 --> 30:23.972
They are the plumbers.

30:24.430 --> 30:26.992
They're the ones
who put Mr. Jarvik in tub.

30:29.063 --> 30:30.308
They did not fix leak.

30:32.819 --> 30:34.234
Fencik and Buchalter.

30:35.466 --> 30:37.117
They're ex-sheriff's deputies.

30:38.350 --> 30:40.132
Nothing worse than a dirty cop.

30:40.407 --> 30:42.695
Is he tied to one of the other ass
through the wall?

30:43.750 --> 30:45.962
To make you happier,
you can bog 'em 1st degree murder.

30:56.805 --> 30:58.366
I'm Detective Brett Hopper.

30:59.099 --> 31:00.660
- Brett Hopper?
- May I come in?

31:07.603 --> 31:09.294
I need to speak to you
about your brother.

31:09.295 --> 31:11.764
- I don't have a brother.
- His name is Miguel Dominguez.

31:11.765 --> 31:13.587
That's your given name, isn't it?

31:13.639 --> 31:14.740
Alma Dominguez?

31:15.190 --> 31:17.117
You must have me confused
with someone else.

31:17.118 --> 31:18.349
His name is Miguel.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.709
He also goes by El Llorón.
The Crying Man.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.645
He killed your parents,
he tried to kill you.

31:26.755 --> 31:29.193
You don't know anything about me.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.015
I know you're lying.

31:32.300 --> 31:33.313
You need to leave.

31:33.314 --> 31:34.823
You've been hiding from him
ever since.

31:34.824 --> 31:36.107
That's why you changed your name?

31:36.108 --> 31:37.783
- Just leave!
- If he knows you're alive,

31:37.784 --> 31:39.908
he's gonna come back after you,
finish what he started.

31:39.909 --> 31:42.241
Your brother's been in prison 17 years

31:42.242 --> 31:44.679
- and you're still scared!
- Just stop it!

31:53.317 --> 31:54.326
Oh my God.

31:56.063 --> 31:58.121
I knew this day would come.

31:59.446 --> 32:01.884
You want everybody
to think you're dead, don't you?

32:01.885 --> 32:03.025
I am dead.

32:05.450 --> 32:06.695
Changing my name

32:07.966 --> 32:09.631
was the only way to be safe.

32:11.705 --> 32:14.964
I'm sorry, but I think somebody
out there already knows the truth.

32:15.271 --> 32:17.473
I found your address in a man's wallet.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.033
Louis Torrez.

32:19.085 --> 32:21.962
I think he may have tracked you down
on behalf of your brother.

32:21.962 --> 32:24.361
- My brother's in prison.
- No, he got out.

32:24.528 --> 32:26.821
Killed someone last night.
Alberto Garza.

32:27.228 --> 32:28.827
And I don't think he's done.

32:29.142 --> 32:30.715
How could you know all this?

32:32.589 --> 32:33.559
Excuse me.

32:35.715 --> 32:36.855
I have to take this.

32:39.831 --> 32:41.758
The gun you gave me,
your prints weren't on it.

32:42.295 --> 32:43.868
Were there any prints on it?

32:46.301 --> 32:48.818
Rednazki found an unspent round
in the clip.

32:49.197 --> 32:51.884
There's one clean print on the casing,
but it doesn't make any sense.

32:51.950 --> 32:54.519
Yes, because it belong to this guy,
Miguel Dominguez,

32:54.520 --> 32:55.895
<i>locked up in Pelican Bay.</i>

32:55.948 --> 32:56.944
How did you...

32:58.744 --> 33:00.919
Is that the guy
you thought was Alma's fondest brother?

33:00.920 --> 33:02.846
Yeah, and I'm afraid
she may be his next victim.

33:02.911 --> 33:05.126
- Hopper, the guy's in prison.
- <i>Andrea, listen to me.</i>

33:05.233 --> 33:07.243
I need you to go to Robbery/Homicide.

33:07.244 --> 33:08.974
Find Detective Choi, he'll listen.

33:09.026 --> 33:11.360
Alright, tell him everything,
have him run ballistics.

33:11.554 --> 33:14.319
Tell him the gun should match
the three bullets in Garza's body.

33:14.372 --> 33:15.369
I'm on it.

33:21.262 --> 33:23.949
He just showed... at my door...
That's what I'm telling you.

33:24.919 --> 33:27.122
No, his name is Brett Hopper.

33:27.397 --> 33:28.623
He's looking for you.

33:28.937 --> 33:31.244
He knows about you,
the prison, Torrez...

33:33.205 --> 33:36.014
He's standing right here in front of me.
Yeah, I'll tell him.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.225
How could you talk to him?

33:42.226 --> 33:44.964
How could you protect that monster
after what he did to your family?

33:44.965 --> 33:47.795
- After what he did to you?
- He didn't to this to me!

33:47.796 --> 33:51.125
My father did this to me
and my mother stood there and watched.

33:51.828 --> 33:54.633
They're the monsters,
my brother tried to save me.

33:55.642 --> 33:56.795
Are you his contact?

33:58.669 --> 34:00.702
Torrez comes here to you.

34:01.291 --> 34:03.027
You give El Llorón the orders.

34:03.774 --> 34:06.251
You know why they call him
the crying man ?

34:06.802 --> 34:09.514
You think those tears are
for the people he kills?

34:09.646 --> 34:11.389
El Llorón cries for me.

34:11.521 --> 34:14.235
You were talking to him
and you said I'll tell him what?

34:15.192 --> 34:16.175
Tell me what?

34:17.516 --> 34:20.231
My brother said that you don't have
to find El Llorón.

34:20.965 --> 34:22.393
El Llorón will find you.

34:33.618 --> 34:34.348
+

34:43.205 --> 34:45.315
Hey... I've been meaning to tell you:

34:46.558 --> 34:48.851
I knocked down that wall
you hated in the kitchen.

34:48.905 --> 34:49.913
You were right.

34:50.449 --> 34:52.338
Makes the whole place feel bigger.

34:53.741 --> 34:55.902
You should come over
check it out some time.

34:55.904 --> 34:58.106
<i>Hey, this is Rita...
Leave the message.</i>

35:11.699 --> 35:14.556
- What?
- You need to change that ringtone.

35:16.129 --> 35:17.125
I like it.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.437
Some people just don't quit.

36:15.552 --> 36:17.400
Where do you keep your blankets ?

36:44.788 --> 36:47.541
Aren't you glad
you finally picked up that phone?

36:48.602 --> 36:49.888
I'm a ghost.

36:50.885 --> 36:51.895
I'll be back.

36:52.406 --> 36:53.533
And you'll be dead.

36:54.464 --> 36:55.460
You...

36:55.512 --> 36:57.347
and everyone you love.

37:07.530 --> 37:11.177
Miguel Dominguez, you're under arrest
for the murder of Alberto Garza.

37:11.332 --> 37:12.887
You have the right to remain silent,

37:12.888 --> 37:15.653
anything you say can and will be used
against you...

37:26.646 --> 37:28.415
Dominguez's prints
are on the murder weapon.

37:28.945 --> 37:30.650
We may have a few loose ends,

37:30.651 --> 37:33.022
but everybody can see it as it is,
about now.

37:33.224 --> 37:34.600
And the Feds are on their way.

37:34.601 --> 37:37.523
They'll make sure Dominguez
never steps out of a cell again.

37:37.576 --> 37:39.961
They're also looking into the names
that you provided.

37:39.962 --> 37:42.032
Conrad Detweiler, Tobias Booth.

37:42.530 --> 37:44.404
And we'll bring in Mrs. Garza back in

37:44.405 --> 37:46.292
sort out her conflict in testimony.

37:46.293 --> 37:47.262
Alright, good.

37:48.350 --> 37:50.610
It's been a long way to assist you, Hop.

37:50.611 --> 37:52.996
Don't know how you figured it all out
so fast.

37:54.217 --> 37:55.947
It wasn't as fast as it looks.

37:56.446 --> 37:57.416
Well, it's over.

37:57.599 --> 37:58.844
Now you're a free man.

37:59.801 --> 38:02.231
Go home, get some sleep,
you both look like you could use some.

38:02.232 --> 38:05.182
Yeah, the sooner we can put
this day behind us, the better.

38:05.470 --> 38:07.310
Took the words right out of my mouth.

38:07.472 --> 38:08.472
Excuse me.

38:30.789 --> 38:31.798
Something wrong?

38:41.927 --> 38:43.304
Everything's gonna be OK.

38:51.193 --> 38:53.212
I think we finally figured it out.

38:54.352 --> 38:56.279
You must be glad
this day is over.

39:05.155 --> 39:07.174
You wanna watch the sunrise with me?

39:10.719 --> 39:12.226
I'll be right back.

39:25.246 --> 39:27.291

39:27.435 --> 39:28.471
<i>You're a free man.</i>

39:29.951 --> 39:32.284
Here comes the sun!
You're gonna miss it!

40:06.458 --> 40:07.467
Morning.

40:15.834 --> 40:16.935
Something wrong?
