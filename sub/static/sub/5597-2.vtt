00:21.386 --> 00:23.554
Officer, morning.

00:24.523 --> 00:28.659
I need to change this patient's catheter.

00:28.693 --> 00:31.728
Maybe you'd like to give us some privacy.

00:31.763 --> 00:33.564
Isn't that a nurse's job?

00:33.598 --> 00:37.901
Uh, yeah, but, uh... never
around when you need one, right?

00:37.936 --> 00:40.971
Well, the guy's in a coma.
Not like he cares.

00:41.005 --> 00:43.173
I guess I could get a coffee.

00:43.207 --> 00:44.507
I'll be right back.

00:44.542 --> 00:46.376
Thank you.

00:55.753 --> 00:57.854
You were in my home.

00:57.889 --> 01:00.856
That is not gonna happen again.

01:00.891 --> 01:03.759
You wanted to talk. Now's your chance.

01:03.794 --> 01:05.528
Charlie.

01:05.563 --> 01:07.564
- Hey.
- What brings you up here?

01:07.598 --> 01:11.101
Uh, uh, I was supposed to meet,
um, Dr. Hart.

01:11.135 --> 01:13.403
I guess he's running late.

01:13.437 --> 01:15.238
Right.

01:15.272 --> 01:16.539
So, what was up with you last night?

01:16.574 --> 01:18.575
- You didn't come to bed.
- Mnh.

01:18.609 --> 01:21.043
I just got a lot on my mind.

01:22.213 --> 01:23.713
Can I help?

01:23.747 --> 01:25.014
No.

01:25.048 --> 01:27.149
No, it's nothing I can't handle.

01:30.886 --> 01:33.555
Dr. Singh: We need to fill
the position as soon as possible.

01:33.590 --> 01:36.725
When we contacted Dr. Katz,
she recommended you very highly.

01:36.759 --> 01:38.227
How is Sydney?

01:38.261 --> 01:39.212
Hard to say.

01:39.272 --> 01:41.296
Not really one for small talk,
is she?

01:41.331 --> 01:42.731
No, she isn't.

01:42.765 --> 01:44.366
So, what do you think, Dr. Lin?

01:44.400 --> 01:45.934
You want to come to Cleveland?

01:45.968 --> 01:48.537
I'm really flattered to be headhunted.

01:48.571 --> 01:50.939
We call it surgical recruiting.

01:50.973 --> 01:52.024
Right.

01:52.895 --> 01:54.223
But it's a lot to think about.

01:54.273 --> 01:56.573
Um, may I take the day to decide?

01:56.623 --> 01:57.378
Of course.

01:57.412 --> 01:59.113
But we do need to present our candidate

01:59.148 --> 02:00.742
to the board tomorrow.

02:00.983 --> 02:01.882
Bye for now.

02:02.270 --> 02:05.119
I look forward to hearing
your answer.

02:06.272 --> 02:07.388
Me too.

02:12.413 --> 02:14.962
So, give me all the dirt.
What's been going on?

02:14.996 --> 02:18.666
Massive debt, tons of
responsibility, no authority.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.635
I'm basically a glorified temp.

02:20.669 --> 02:22.636
Well, aren't you just a ray of sunshine?

02:22.671 --> 02:24.656
We have to get staff jobs, Alex.

02:24.706 --> 02:26.650
I know. Problem is, there aren't any.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.008
Let me ask you...

02:28.043 --> 02:32.012
If a good job came up out of town,
would you take it?

02:32.489 --> 02:33.513
I don't know.

02:33.616 --> 02:35.616
Charlie's here.
We've got the condo, a great nanny,

02:35.666 --> 02:38.118
but for you, Mags, it might be
everything you're looking for.

02:39.387 --> 02:41.088
Dawn wants to see me.

02:41.122 --> 02:44.357
Mm. Dawn hasn't wanted to see
me since you've been gone.

02:44.392 --> 02:47.026
Consider yourself lucky.

03:03.811 --> 03:05.011
Good morning, Alex. Come in.

03:05.045 --> 03:06.513
Yeah. You wanted to see me?

03:06.547 --> 03:08.447
Yes. I have a welcome-back surprise for you,

03:08.481 --> 03:09.948
and I think you're gonna like it.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.150
You seem...

03:12.185 --> 03:14.220
I seem...?

03:15.388 --> 03:16.888
I don't know.

03:16.923 --> 03:19.057
Happy, I guess.

03:21.207 --> 03:22.828
Well, thank you
for calling attention to it

03:22.862 --> 03:24.496
and making me feel self-conscious.

03:24.531 --> 03:25.897
And you're back.

03:25.932 --> 03:27.866
Dr. Clara Levine... you know her?

03:27.900 --> 03:29.901
Absolutely. She's gen-surg royalty.

03:29.936 --> 03:32.705
Well, she needs someone to
assist her in the O.R. today.

03:32.739 --> 03:34.372
And?

03:34.406 --> 03:36.507
And she's bringing her
patient down to the O.R. now.

03:36.542 --> 03:38.243
Clara does not like to wait.

03:38.277 --> 03:40.044
Great. Then I'd better get going.

03:40.078 --> 03:41.579
- Oh, and Dawn?
- Hmm?

03:41.614 --> 03:43.981
Those were some pretty sweet moves.

03:51.757 --> 03:53.491
Dr. Levine, good to see you.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.326
Alex. Glad you could join me.

03:55.361 --> 03:59.959
The patient is a 37-year-old
veterinarian kicked by a horse.

04:00.222 --> 04:02.113
And if it makes you feel any better,

04:02.163 --> 04:03.808
sometimes humans kick their doctors, too.

04:03.858 --> 04:05.859
Ugh. Not with 2,000 pounds of force.

04:05.909 --> 04:07.071
Oh, don't worry.

04:07.105 --> 04:09.706
We'll have you right as rain in no time.

04:09.741 --> 04:14.044
The, uh, imaging shows the
kick lacerated her spleen.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.074
That'll have to come out.

04:15.145 --> 04:17.081
I wanted to thank you for
the opportunity to assist.

04:17.115 --> 04:18.348
You are an inspiration.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.949
Oh, damn it.

04:19.983 --> 04:22.352
I left my phone in the E.R.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.755
You start prepping,
and I will be right back.

04:24.789 --> 04:26.456
You bet.

04:27.992 --> 04:30.560
Seventh time's the charm,
eh, Dr. Harris?

04:30.595 --> 04:32.562
Well, it definitely looks like it's healing,

04:32.597 --> 04:34.731
but only you know how it feels, Dean.

04:34.766 --> 04:36.966
Well, it feels good
having seven surgeries behind me

04:37.001 --> 04:39.602
and only... well, maybe one to go.

04:39.636 --> 04:42.138
Yeah. Six months ago,
this leg was roadkill.

04:42.173 --> 04:44.808
Even I had my doubts we'd save it.

04:44.842 --> 04:46.542
Um, you keeping up with the physio?

04:46.576 --> 04:48.912
Best as I can, but I got
to spend time at the shop.

04:48.946 --> 04:50.914
The place is in even worse shape than I am.

04:50.948 --> 04:52.615
If you want something done right...

04:52.649 --> 04:54.818
You do it yourself. Exactly.

04:54.852 --> 04:58.054
So, what now, Dr. Harris?
We schedule another surgery?

04:58.088 --> 05:01.623
Um I want to see how
that damaged nerve is doing,

05:01.657 --> 05:03.091
so let's get you up.

05:04.527 --> 05:06.494
Thanks.

05:10.633 --> 05:13.235
With the brace,
I get around pretty good.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.470
Yeah. Dr. Hamza is gonna
do a conduction study,

05:15.504 --> 05:17.172
see if that nerve is regenerating.

05:17.207 --> 05:19.341
Hopefully we'll see an
improvement this time.

05:19.375 --> 05:21.143
You will. Trust me.

05:22.879 --> 05:26.613
Uh, Dean, I noticed, um,
you made an early renewal request

05:26.648 --> 05:27.949
for your pain meds.

05:27.983 --> 05:29.183
How are you coping these days?

05:29.218 --> 05:30.985
Oh, just fine.

05:31.019 --> 05:32.987
Yeah? Uh...

05:33.021 --> 05:35.957
Charlie, I should never
have come to your house.

05:35.991 --> 05:37.658
I get that.

05:37.692 --> 05:39.626
You okay there, doc?

05:40.963 --> 05:43.231
Um, yeah.

05:58.203 --> 06:00.119
I know I was out of line, okay?

06:00.169 --> 06:01.387
But uh-uh...

06:01.437 --> 06:03.571
- Look, come on.
- Don't ignore me, all right?

06:03.605 --> 06:05.573
Y-you're all I've got.

06:09.444 --> 06:11.211
You were in my home.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.480
I wanted to talk.
I didn't mean to freak you out.

06:13.514 --> 06:15.214
I'm not the bad guy you think I am.

06:15.248 --> 06:17.416
You're a convicted murderer, Mr. Crenshaw.

06:17.451 --> 06:19.552
You're the very definition of a bad guy.

06:20.621 --> 06:22.354
Look, you don't need to like me,

06:22.389 --> 06:26.659
but I am in a situation here,
and I need your help.

06:28.562 --> 06:29.896
You're in a coma.

06:29.930 --> 06:32.098
Trust me...
there's nothing more I'd like

06:32.132 --> 06:34.067
than to help you
get out of this hospital.

06:34.101 --> 06:35.902
So, if I can do that, I will.

06:35.936 --> 06:37.770
But we communicate on my terms.

06:37.805 --> 06:40.339
And rule number one is,
you stay away from my family.

06:40.373 --> 06:41.773
Do you understand?

06:41.808 --> 06:45.411
- But...
- I said, do you understand?

07:06.798 --> 07:08.032
Rough night?

07:08.066 --> 07:10.235
Hey. No. It was a great night...

07:10.269 --> 07:11.802
Just a bit of a late one.

07:11.837 --> 07:13.070
Mm.

07:13.105 --> 07:14.396
Also, I deserve a break.

07:14.446 --> 07:17.308
I just dealt with a kid's birthday
party gone horribly wrong.

07:17.343 --> 07:20.445
Molten cheese burns and puncture
wounds from pointy forks.

07:20.479 --> 07:22.280
Ohh.

07:22.314 --> 07:24.713
Fondue and 5-year-olds don't mix
is the obvious lesson here.

07:24.763 --> 07:25.534
Yep.

07:25.584 --> 07:28.085
Well, that and get out of
the E.R. while you can.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.421
Yeah. Not until I put a
dent in my student loan

07:30.456 --> 07:32.922
or a good staff job comes along.

07:32.957 --> 07:35.992
Well, when it does, run for the hills.

07:36.027 --> 07:39.229
I mean, I like it here.

07:39.264 --> 07:41.765
And I have my friends and...

07:41.799 --> 07:43.467
Places are just concrete and steel,

07:43.501 --> 07:45.669
and friends get over each
other faster than you think.

07:45.703 --> 07:48.138
- Hmm.
- You know, they did a study,

07:48.173 --> 07:49.739
a study on the average time it takes

07:49.774 --> 07:51.241
to be forgotten in the workplace.

07:51.276 --> 07:52.643
Guess how long.

07:52.677 --> 07:53.977
I...

07:54.011 --> 07:56.480
- 2 1/2 days.
- Oh.

07:56.514 --> 07:58.444
That's kind of sobering, isn't it,
that no one

07:59.002 --> 08:00.562
misses anyone,

08:00.612 --> 08:02.082
not for long.

08:02.118 --> 08:04.453
Right. Good to know.

08:04.488 --> 08:06.222
One of you got a sec?

08:07.357 --> 08:09.258
Yeah.

08:14.757 --> 08:16.165
- What happened to her?
- Didn't even get a name.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.433
Okay.

08:17.467 --> 08:19.034
Hi. I'm Dr. Lin.

08:19.069 --> 08:22.337
I see you have a cut on
your head there, Ms...?

08:22.371 --> 08:24.873
Uh, I'm actually fine.
I was just about to go.

08:24.908 --> 08:26.033
I think you should stay here.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.547
Um, can you tell me what happened?

08:27.597 --> 08:29.611
It's just I've-I've, uh, lost my purse,

08:29.645 --> 08:31.446
but I'll-I'll come
back after I've found it.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.715
Oh, we can have someone find it for you.

08:32.749 --> 08:33.753
Do you know where you saw it last?

08:33.803 --> 08:35.337
I fell down in the street on my way.

08:35.388 --> 08:37.558
Um, I think it's probably just outside.

08:37.609 --> 08:39.477
- Somebody could steal it. I should go...
- Hold on. Hold on.

08:39.549 --> 08:40.881
I really... I don't have time for this.

08:40.948 --> 08:44.359
Just... just let me clean
up the cut. Please?

08:45.561 --> 08:46.590
Come with me.

08:46.657 --> 08:48.663
It's okay.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.735
You just had a baby, didn't you?

08:53.769 --> 08:56.137
Yes. Luke. 11 months. Do you have kids?

08:56.171 --> 08:57.805
No, no kids for me.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.241
It was all work.

09:00.676 --> 09:03.745
Besides, in those days, if you stepped away,

09:03.779 --> 09:06.580
they would never let you back in again.

09:06.615 --> 09:08.482
Ah, Dr. Curtis.

09:08.516 --> 09:10.584
Do you two know each other?

09:10.619 --> 09:12.153
We met yesterday.

09:12.187 --> 09:13.387
Several times, in fact.

09:13.421 --> 09:15.189
Good to see you again, Dr. Reid.

09:15.224 --> 09:19.660
I have heard wonderful
things about this young man.

09:19.694 --> 09:21.829
I've invited him to observe.

09:21.864 --> 09:23.898
If you don't mind, Dr. Reid.

09:23.932 --> 09:25.366
Not at all.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.567
I've finished scrubbing.
You can take my place.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.940
Almost done, Mr. Powell.

09:33.975 --> 09:35.776
Not too uncomfortable, I hope?

09:35.810 --> 09:37.258
Mnh. Barely feel it.

09:37.521 --> 09:38.723
Having your leg crushed by a forklift

09:38.773 --> 09:40.247
must really make pain relative.

09:40.281 --> 09:42.749
Yeah.

09:42.784 --> 09:45.518
Interesting fact... a major
pain receptor in the lower leg

09:45.592 --> 09:46.794
is called the saphenous nerve,

09:46.844 --> 09:48.183
derived from the arabic word "safin,"

09:48.236 --> 09:49.662
meaning hidden or concealed,

09:49.712 --> 09:51.961
but that's actually in reference
to the saphenous vein,

09:52.011 --> 09:53.219
which was kind of hidden,

09:53.269 --> 09:55.757
at least if you were practicing
medicine in the middle ages.

09:59.453 --> 10:01.173
Almost done, Mr. Powell.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.303
Well, look who I found
just wandering the halls.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.937
Hey, Danielle.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.273
Dr. Hamza's just about
finished electrocuting me.

10:07.308 --> 10:08.608
Okay.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.576
All finished, Dr. Harris.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.244
Uh, why don't you two go grab some lunch,

10:12.279 --> 10:14.079
and we'll have the results
when you get back?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.547
Thank you, doctors.

10:15.581 --> 10:17.049
Thank you.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.984
How'd it go?

10:19.019 --> 10:21.086
Zero improvement in the peroneal nerve.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.155
So, the motor nerve is not functioning,

10:23.190 --> 10:25.757
while the sensory nerve
is causing him much agony.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.626
It's ironic when you think about it.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.962
He keeps telling me pain isn't a problem.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.131
Well, he's become very good at masking it.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.581
And he wants another surgery.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.444
Okay, I know how much time
you've spent with him, Charlie,

10:35.508 --> 10:37.800
but that leg is never
gonna function properly.

10:37.882 --> 10:40.426
And in my opinion,
the pain is never gonna go away.

10:40.639 --> 10:43.007
Then he'll likely end up
self-medicating to manage it.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.794
If he isn't already.

10:45.452 --> 10:48.739
Charlie, I think it's time
you re-opened the subject of amputation.

10:52.351 --> 10:55.653
You're married to Charlie Harris, right?

10:55.687 --> 10:57.121
Not married but together.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.456
Ah.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.358
Charlie's a great surgeon.

11:00.392 --> 11:03.327
And according to, uh, Dawn, so are you.

11:03.361 --> 11:04.794
She said that?

11:04.829 --> 11:07.597
I trained Dawn when she was a resident.

11:07.631 --> 11:09.499
Such a nervous little thing.

11:09.533 --> 11:11.468
She used to follow me around like a puppy.

11:11.502 --> 11:14.471
I'm sure we'd all love to hear
some young Dawn bell stories.

11:14.505 --> 11:16.874
Ah, one day I'll tell you the story

11:16.908 --> 11:21.510
of how she accidentally sewed
her finger onto a cadaver.

11:23.046 --> 11:25.948
Okay. Suction.

11:28.085 --> 11:31.053
I think that's got it.

11:31.088 --> 11:32.989
We're ready to remove the bag.

11:33.023 --> 11:34.723
Dr. Reid?

11:34.758 --> 11:36.725
Looks good to me.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.328
Hang tight there, Dr. Curtis.

11:39.363 --> 11:42.230
You'll get your turn in a moment.

11:42.265 --> 11:44.833
It never gets old,
bossing handsome young men around.

11:49.739 --> 11:51.907
- - Where are you from, Natalie?
Uh, I live here.

11:51.941 --> 11:52.991
- I was at the hotel, um...
- Thank you.

11:53.041 --> 11:54.085
Just taking a little break.

11:54.135 --> 11:55.006
A break from what?

11:55.059 --> 11:57.806
You said this was only gonna be, um, a minute.

11:57.856 --> 11:59.516
- Can you get off me? Wh-wh-why...
why are you doing that?
- We're just-just...

11:59.566 --> 12:00.870
Okay, we're just drawing
some blood for a tox screen.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.717
- It's okay.
- No, I'm not... I'm not on drugs, okay?

12:02.751 --> 12:04.634
- Okay. Just a pinch.
- Ow.

12:04.684 --> 12:06.186
- Easy. Easy, now.
- Okay. Just hold your arm still for me.

12:06.221 --> 12:07.822
We're almost done.

12:07.856 --> 12:09.924
Okay, no, I've, uh...
I've been here long enough.

12:09.958 --> 12:12.026
No. Don't go yet. I just want you
to wait for the test results.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.728
Just 10 more minutes, okay?

12:15.363 --> 12:16.931
Natalie! No!

12:16.965 --> 12:18.866
Natalie, calm down.

12:18.901 --> 12:20.200
Somebody call security.

12:20.235 --> 12:22.202
- - Okay. Whoa.
Natalie!

12:22.237 --> 12:24.404
- I got her. I got her.
- Don't make me wait for the tox screen,

12:24.439 --> 12:26.239
and don't make me form you up to psych.

12:26.273 --> 12:27.568
Just tell me
what you're withdrawing from

12:27.618 --> 12:29.576
so I can help you. Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh.

12:35.162 --> 12:37.042
I know it's the future but

12:37.177 --> 12:38.535
video games surgery

12:38.603 --> 12:42.743
really takes the fun out of
diving into an open cavity.

12:42.777 --> 12:46.246
Okay, I think we're about done here.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.178
Clips.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.581
Towel.

12:49.666 --> 12:52.793
And, uh, can we lower the
temperature a little more, please?

12:52.946 --> 12:55.487
Dr. Levine, should we consider

12:55.537 --> 12:57.524
closing the vessels with suture ligature?

12:57.616 --> 13:00.029
Those clips alone may let go
and cause her to hemorrhage.

13:00.093 --> 13:03.594
I don't see any danger of hemorrhaging.

13:03.629 --> 13:07.398
If I start suturing every
vessel with these chopsticks,

13:07.432 --> 13:09.734
we're gonna be here all night.

13:09.769 --> 13:12.330
But based on my experience,

13:12.411 --> 13:13.304
we may have more certainty

13:13.354 --> 13:15.674
- with suture ligature.
- Based on your experience?

13:15.708 --> 13:17.876
Listen, I don't mean to be out of line here.

13:17.910 --> 13:19.510
Well, as long as you don't
mean to be out of line.

13:19.545 --> 13:20.945
Dr. Sharpe, how's her B.P.?

13:20.980 --> 13:22.881
She's steady, Dr. Levine.

13:22.915 --> 13:25.716
Since we're almost done here,

13:25.750 --> 13:28.886
how about we let Patrick
step in for a moment?

13:28.920 --> 13:32.690
I'd really like him to
have a chance to assist.

13:32.724 --> 13:36.093
Yes. Of course.

13:39.507 --> 13:40.612
Uh, I'm sorry.

13:40.665 --> 13:41.586
I don't know what came over me before,

13:41.639 --> 13:43.801
but this, uh... this isn't necessary.

13:43.835 --> 13:46.337
Okay, hold your hands out for me, please.

13:53.296 --> 13:55.073
Can you tell me how long it's been

13:55.123 --> 13:56.279
since your last drink of alcohol?

13:56.314 --> 13:58.670
Oh, no, this-this... it's,
um, just that I'm anxious.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.344
Are you moderately anxious, or are you...

14:00.394 --> 14:03.126
I'm very, very anxious because
I'm stuck here talking to idiots,

14:03.176 --> 14:04.413
and every second I get more anxious,

14:04.463 --> 14:06.528
- and I'm about to start screaming.
- Okay.

14:06.723 --> 14:08.635
Get that out of my eyes! Oh, my god!

14:10.085 --> 14:11.645
How many drinks do you have a day, Natalie?

14:11.695 --> 14:13.923
If I finish your test,
will you leave me alone?

14:16.631 --> 14:20.302
A few at the end of the day,
a couple at lunch if I'm stressed.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.004
Are you stressed a lot?

14:22.039 --> 14:24.974
Yes. I work in advertising.
It's a very stressful job.

14:25.008 --> 14:29.112
Okay, so, 4 or 5 a day, maybe 35 a week?

14:30.313 --> 14:31.748
Uh, that sounds like a lot.

14:31.782 --> 14:34.016
But I know that I should cut back.

14:34.051 --> 14:38.354
Were you in the hotel trying
to detox from alcohol?

14:38.388 --> 14:39.688
Yes.

14:39.723 --> 14:41.523
But I'm not an alcoholic.

14:41.558 --> 14:43.125
What about drugs? Are you on anything?

14:43.159 --> 14:45.093
I already told you. I don't do drugs.

14:45.128 --> 14:48.530
Okay, just stopping like that
could do you serious harm

14:48.565 --> 14:50.899
if your body's become dependent on alcohol.

14:52.001 --> 14:53.869
You're right. I was, uh,
going about this wrong.

14:53.903 --> 14:55.504
The timing is all wrong.

14:55.538 --> 14:57.139
No, that's not what I'm saying.

14:57.173 --> 14:58.674
I have so much going on right now,

14:58.708 --> 15:00.643
and at work, they already
treat me like I'm...

15:00.677 --> 15:03.311
The thing is, I have already
taken a few days leave.

15:03.345 --> 15:05.213
So, uh, I really should get back...

15:05.248 --> 15:07.715
Natalie, you clearly
wanted to make a change.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.550
I can help you do that.

15:09.585 --> 15:12.053
Just let me give you
something for your anxiety

15:12.088 --> 15:14.355
so you can detox
under medical supervision.

15:14.390 --> 15:15.891
I-I told you.

15:15.925 --> 15:18.226
I am truly sorry about before,
but that sounds extreme.

15:18.261 --> 15:21.696
I think you need help,
right here and right now.

15:23.599 --> 15:27.335
Fine. Um, I will take the
meds just to calm me down,

15:27.369 --> 15:28.803
and then we'll see.

15:28.837 --> 15:30.838
Okay. Maddie, can I get the I.V.?

15:38.747 --> 15:40.981
Dr. Levin, they're ready in O.R. 7.

15:41.016 --> 15:42.101
Tell them I'm en route.

15:42.151 --> 15:42.932
Patrick,

15:43.380 --> 15:46.586
join me after you've finished
suturing those port sites.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.810
You want me to...
Mm. Yes, of course.

15:48.878 --> 15:51.284
Thank you for the opportunity.

15:52.684 --> 15:54.038
Well, this is awkward.

15:54.141 --> 15:55.954
Did I just get cut from the team?

15:56.018 --> 15:58.530
I'm not even sure you're
still in the league.

15:58.587 --> 16:00.400
Thanks for the backup, by the way.

16:00.435 --> 16:01.313
In order to back you up,

16:01.363 --> 16:02.891
I'd have to have supported
your point of view.

16:02.941 --> 16:04.195
We were looking at the same monitor.

16:04.252 --> 16:06.648
You really feel confident that
those clips are gonna hold?

16:06.744 --> 16:09.108
I believe Clara Levine was
performing splenectomies

16:09.143 --> 16:09.964
before we were born.

16:10.084 --> 16:11.623
Not laparoscopically, she wasn't.

16:11.698 --> 16:13.137
Not to mention, you get on her bad side,

16:13.191 --> 16:14.967
you might as well
toss your career in the bin.

16:15.035 --> 16:16.933
Now let's be extra careful
with these port sites.

16:17.007 --> 16:19.200
Patient's not herniating on my watch.

16:19.506 --> 16:20.846
Since when did it become your watch?

16:20.906 --> 16:23.138
When you told Levine she was sloppy.

16:23.198 --> 16:24.947
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.994
No. I was recommending caution.

16:27.118 --> 16:28.935
Seniority doesn't
make her immune to mistakes.

16:29.027 --> 16:31.376
So, keep your mouth shut and
check on the patient later.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.729
- There's a hierarchy.
- I know that, Patrick.

16:33.807 --> 16:36.101
Besides, she's been booking
solid O.R. days all month.

16:36.135 --> 16:37.809
You're two days back from
mat leave. You ask me...

16:37.859 --> 16:40.314
- I didn't.
- But I'm gonna tell you anyway, Alex.

16:40.371 --> 16:41.907
You should apologize.

16:45.111 --> 16:47.646
The peroneal nerve
suffered too much damage.

16:48.030 --> 16:49.846
After six months, we need to accept the fact

16:49.910 --> 16:52.192
that it's not going to recover.

16:53.766 --> 16:56.721
Dean, you'll never have
proper mobility in that leg.

16:56.756 --> 16:58.550
It'll get there, Dr. Harris.

16:58.674 --> 17:00.759
I'll fight harder. I'll do the physio.

17:02.026 --> 17:04.262
Well... given the pain you're in,

17:04.297 --> 17:07.008
I'm not sure that fighting
is the right play anymore.

17:07.089 --> 17:09.034
I already told you, I'm not suffering.

17:09.084 --> 17:11.045
Dean, come on.

17:11.771 --> 17:12.935
Okay.

17:13.309 --> 17:15.224
I have some good days, I have some bad days,

17:15.275 --> 17:16.617
just like anybody else.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.296
What exactly are you saying, Dr. Harris?

17:23.382 --> 17:26.150
I'm saying that we at least
need to have a conversation

17:26.184 --> 17:28.652
about the pros and cons of keeping the leg

17:28.686 --> 17:31.322
versus the pros and cons of amputation.

17:32.636 --> 17:33.649
You got to be kidding me.

17:33.709 --> 17:34.747
Just hear him out, Dean.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.186
Look, I told you after the accident

17:36.236 --> 17:38.265
that that was not an option.

17:38.372 --> 17:41.032
What is it? Are you just
too lazy to stick this out?

17:45.304 --> 17:46.262
I did the surgeries

17:46.336 --> 17:48.145
because I thought that was your best option.

17:48.639 --> 17:50.474
I don't think that anymore.

17:50.508 --> 17:53.676
If you won't save my leg,
I'll find someone who will.

17:55.479 --> 17:57.013
I want a new surgeon.

18:11.162 --> 18:13.196
Alex?

18:13.230 --> 18:15.358
Shouldn't you be in the O.R.
with Dr. Levine?

18:15.432 --> 18:17.934
I'm just following up with
this patient between surgeries.

18:19.369 --> 18:21.537
How are things going with Clara so far?

18:21.572 --> 18:23.706
She's great. It's great.

18:23.740 --> 18:25.938
I'm a little concerned about this patient.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.497
Her B.P. shouldn't be so low,
and her heart rate's high.

18:28.632 --> 18:30.313
Was there a problem with the surgery?

18:31.365 --> 18:33.995
No. There may be a complication.

18:34.045 --> 18:36.259
You know what? I will
follow up with Dr. Levine.

18:36.620 --> 18:38.921
Pay close attention.

18:38.956 --> 18:40.857
She's had a great career.

18:40.891 --> 18:43.025
This could be a good opportunity for you.

18:58.741 --> 19:03.245
About your patient...
I heard you two talking.

19:15.791 --> 19:18.459
I'm in an elevator, so I may lose you.

19:18.494 --> 19:19.861
You spying on me now?

19:19.896 --> 19:21.897
It's not like that.

19:21.931 --> 19:24.032
I thought maybe I could help you out.

19:24.066 --> 19:25.299
I don't need your help.

19:25.334 --> 19:28.403
I can watch him without him knowing,

19:28.437 --> 19:30.261
figure out what he's really afraid of.

19:30.311 --> 19:33.909
I'm pretty sure he's afraid of,
uh, losing his leg, Tom.

19:33.943 --> 19:35.944
Sure.

19:37.536 --> 19:39.732
But maybe there's more to it than that.

19:40.248 --> 19:42.441
I mean, I got nothing but time here.

19:42.817 --> 19:44.652
Let me help you.

19:44.686 --> 19:47.732
Well, you could start by, um...

19:49.684 --> 19:51.898
Not creeping on me like a giant tangerine.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.895
Just don't tell me to go to hell again.

19:54.930 --> 19:59.266
I'm serving life in prison.
I've already made that trip.

20:00.468 --> 20:03.803
Really want to help?
Change my patient's mind.

20:11.334 --> 20:12.123
Zach.

20:12.333 --> 20:13.680
Hey. Are you sending her up to psych?

20:13.714 --> 20:15.082
I think she should stay here.

20:15.116 --> 20:17.150
She could go into serious withdrawal.

20:17.185 --> 20:19.086
She says she has 35 drinks a week.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.520
- 35?
- Mm-hmm.

20:20.555 --> 20:22.707
So, you double that, you're looking at 70.

20:22.757 --> 20:24.910
She's like
a one-woman frat house.

20:24.960 --> 20:25.770
Yeah.

20:25.916 --> 20:27.288
I'm gonna find her a bed in detox.

20:27.455 --> 20:28.595
I don't want her leaving.

20:28.629 --> 20:30.362
If she's as bad as I think,
the withdrawal could kill her.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.031
Okay, admit her.

20:32.066 --> 20:33.633
She's seizing.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.473
Okay. Protect her airway.

20:37.523 --> 20:38.671
- Okay.
- Grab that arm.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.207
- Keep her from pulling out that I.V.
- Let's get some high-flow O2 in here!

20:41.241 --> 20:43.476
Okay, protect her airway.
Let's move this bed!

20:47.219 --> 20:48.942
Natalie you had a seizure, okay?

20:48.992 --> 20:50.283
- But we've got you.
- ***

20:50.333 --> 20:52.787
- Just hold her down.
- Okay, where's that tox screen?

20:52.837 --> 20:54.415
- I'll get it.
- Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

20:54.465 --> 20:56.153
- Oh, my god!
- What is it, Natalie? What is it, Natalie?

20:56.203 --> 20:58.923
- Don't you see?!
- 10 milligrams of diazepam.

20:58.973 --> 21:00.574
- How much have you given her already?
- Plenty.

21:00.912 --> 21:03.019
She said she didn't,
but she must have a pill addiction

21:03.069 --> 21:05.201
- as well as the alcohol.
- Yeah, but if you give her too much diazepam,

21:05.251 --> 21:06.989
you know that you risk
compromising her breathing, right?

21:07.039 --> 21:07.980
Okay, so we vent her,

21:08.015 --> 21:09.749
but we can't have her seizing
again or hurting herself.

21:09.784 --> 21:11.250
- Do it.
- Tox screens.

21:11.285 --> 21:13.085
- You need to see this.
- Okay. Take this.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.987
Watch her head. Watch her head.

21:15.022 --> 21:16.423
Hold her down.

21:16.457 --> 21:18.358
Yep, high level of benzodiazepines

21:18.392 --> 21:19.992
already in her system. 20 milligrams.

21:20.027 --> 21:22.128
I'm gonna push her past her tolerance,

21:22.162 --> 21:24.464
get her stable, and take her up to detox.

21:24.498 --> 21:26.165
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Almost there.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.467
Okay. You're okay. You're okay.

21:28.501 --> 21:30.436
Shh, shh.

21:30.470 --> 21:31.804
It's okay.

21:31.839 --> 21:33.372
Please get me out of here.

21:33.406 --> 21:35.474
I can't be here anymore.

21:35.508 --> 21:37.676
We're gonna get you better, okay?

21:37.711 --> 21:40.313
We're gonna get you better.

21:46.086 --> 21:48.888
- Dr. Levine?
- Hmm?

21:48.922 --> 21:52.023
I just wanted to say that I
shouldn't have questioned you

21:52.058 --> 21:53.525
that way in the O.R.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.960
That's fine.

21:54.994 --> 21:57.329
How's our animal doctor doing?

21:57.364 --> 22:00.999
That's actually why I'm here.
Her B.P. is dropping.

22:01.033 --> 22:04.069
She's reacting to the epidural.
Have anesthesia turn that down.

22:04.103 --> 22:06.805
Okay. That's a possibility.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.507
But I think we need to be certain.

22:09.503 --> 22:11.042
Why are you doing this?

22:11.077 --> 22:14.027
I would never have
questioned a senior surgeon

22:14.077 --> 22:15.247
when I was coming up.

22:15.281 --> 22:19.517
Honestly, I'm just worried about
the well-being of our patient.

22:19.551 --> 22:21.052
Give her some fluids.

22:21.087 --> 22:23.255
Tell me how she's doing
at the end of the day.

22:23.289 --> 22:25.924
Unless you'd like to micromanage
that decision, as well?

22:27.026 --> 22:29.427
No. I wouldn't.

22:38.621 --> 22:42.477
He's keeping his pain a
secret from her out of pride.

22:42.775 --> 22:44.073
I watched him.

22:44.542 --> 22:47.912
The moment she left the room, he broke down.

22:58.056 --> 23:01.558
When Amy killed herself, I was a mess.

23:03.895 --> 23:06.563
But still, I was proud. I...

23:07.966 --> 23:10.801
I wouldn't let anyone see me like that. I...

23:13.471 --> 23:16.306
I didn't want to look weak.

23:16.340 --> 23:18.708
Instead, it made me look guilty.

23:18.743 --> 23:22.512
It... it ruined my life...

23:24.081 --> 23:26.082
just like your guy's ruining his.

23:42.866 --> 23:44.567
Mm-hmm.

23:44.601 --> 23:46.469
Okay. Thanks.

23:47.938 --> 23:50.739
Well, I got her full name... Natalie Dryden.

23:50.774 --> 23:53.175
Tried to get in touch with family,
but no luck.

23:53.209 --> 23:55.511
Husband left a year ago with their daughter.

23:55.545 --> 23:57.612
Both parents and a sister... all dead.

23:57.646 --> 24:00.147
So, no one to stop her from
drinking herself to death.

24:00.182 --> 24:01.749
No friends or coworkers?

24:01.784 --> 24:03.250
I tried calling her work,

24:03.369 --> 24:05.687
made up a story about finding her purse.

24:05.721 --> 24:09.156
They said she'd been fired weeks ago.

24:09.191 --> 24:10.925
Hmm.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.628
Listen

24:13.662 --> 24:15.329
the question you asked me earlier

24:15.364 --> 24:17.031
about going to another hospital,
that wasn't hypothetical,

24:17.065 --> 24:19.265
- was it?
- No.

24:19.300 --> 24:20.634
Where?

24:20.668 --> 24:21.869
Cleveland.

24:21.903 --> 24:25.171
Gynecological staff position.

24:25.206 --> 24:27.808
Well, if you don't take it, I will.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.610
I don't know what to do.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.780
Look, I can't speak for
everyone here, Maggie Lin,

24:33.815 --> 24:36.683
but I'll tell you right
now that if you go...

24:36.718 --> 24:38.852
I'll miss the hell out of you.

24:38.887 --> 24:40.453
I'm serious.

24:40.488 --> 24:42.255
Thank you.

24:51.832 --> 24:54.667
May I have her chart, please? Thank you.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.036
Hello, Cynthia.

24:56.070 --> 24:59.005
I've never been kicked before.

25:00.274 --> 25:02.975
I walked into that stable.

25:04.345 --> 25:07.079
It was like that horse knew I was coming.

25:07.113 --> 25:09.814
You think the horse knew you
were there to euthanize him?

25:09.849 --> 25:12.717
I don't have any other explanation.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.888
Even through the pain, he was scared.

25:16.923 --> 25:19.324
I know the feeling.

25:19.359 --> 25:22.928
Try to relax, okay?

25:22.962 --> 25:24.530
Thank you.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.432
You're welcome.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.877
Page Dr. Levine and book an O.R.

25:38.911 --> 25:41.046
and cross and type this
patient for four units.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.048
I need her back on a table right now.

25:47.286 --> 25:48.920
Let's go!

25:48.955 --> 25:51.122
Hey! Any sign of her?

25:51.156 --> 25:53.758
No, but operating on Levine's
patient is a risky move, Alex.

25:53.793 --> 25:55.293
Doing nothing is a bigger risk,
and I need you with me.

25:55.327 --> 25:56.927
I can't do it alone.

25:56.962 --> 25:59.564
Ah, so, this is to be a career
murder/suicide, then, is it?

25:59.598 --> 26:00.798
Wonderful.

26:00.832 --> 26:02.366
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Hey.

26:02.401 --> 26:05.570
- Back it up, will you?
- Back... back up the bed!

26:07.973 --> 26:09.373
Her chest tube's been dislodged.

26:09.408 --> 26:10.575
Okay, we got to move.

26:16.730 --> 26:18.042
Better?

26:18.831 --> 26:20.731
Are you thirsty?

26:22.524 --> 26:24.738
Um, when can you release me?

26:24.788 --> 26:26.270
I need to get back to work.

26:26.305 --> 26:28.272
Don't think about work right now.

26:28.307 --> 26:30.808
It's so embarrassing.

26:30.843 --> 26:33.945
I'm not like this. This isn't me.

26:33.979 --> 26:35.846
I believe that.

26:37.681 --> 26:39.216
Okay, I'm gonna let you rest.

26:39.567 --> 26:40.884
You can stay the night,

26:40.918 --> 26:44.420
and then tomorrow we can
talk about the next steps.

26:46.324 --> 26:47.690
The next steps?

26:47.725 --> 26:49.226
Don't be afraid.

26:49.260 --> 26:51.161
You're gonna do much better here with us

26:51.195 --> 26:54.064
than you would all alone in some hotel room.

26:54.098 --> 26:57.868
Um, maybe there's, uh, no point to this.

26:59.770 --> 27:02.372
Natalie, I don't know when you decided

27:02.406 --> 27:06.476
you weren't worth anything... but you are.

27:06.510 --> 27:09.846
You're the point to this.

27:11.415 --> 27:14.350
Okay.

27:17.921 --> 27:20.390
New tube's draining well.
One less thing to worry about.

27:20.424 --> 27:21.858
Great.

27:21.892 --> 27:24.427
- You are unbelievable.
- Sorry?

27:24.461 --> 27:27.162
Intracorporeal suturing kind
of gives me the collywobbles.

27:27.197 --> 27:28.531
What?

27:28.565 --> 27:30.400
That is to say, it-it makes me nervous.

27:30.434 --> 27:32.167
Who's to say I'm not nervous?

27:32.202 --> 27:33.903
Well, you don't suture like you're nervous.

27:33.937 --> 27:35.771
How's her B.P., Dr. Sharpe?

27:35.805 --> 27:37.406
Still low and getting lower.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.874
How is that possible?

27:38.909 --> 27:40.776
I sutured all the vessels
of the splenic bed,

27:40.810 --> 27:42.344
but it's still coming proximal to that.

27:42.379 --> 27:44.046
Maybe a branch of the splenic artery?

27:44.080 --> 27:45.414
Or is it possible something
else was ruptured by the kick?

27:45.448 --> 27:47.582
Would have showed up in the imaging.

27:47.617 --> 27:49.751
Something happened in the first surgery.

27:49.786 --> 27:51.453
I was watching. Suction.

27:51.487 --> 27:55.524
But when we switched places,
neither of us were.

27:55.558 --> 27:57.058
So, you think...

27:57.092 --> 27:58.427
Perhaps she nicked something.

27:58.461 --> 28:00.595
The tail of the pancreas.

28:00.630 --> 28:02.431
And that could have
opened the splenic artery.

28:03.966 --> 28:06.267
We're gonna have to open her up.

28:08.504 --> 28:10.071
Listen, you could find a doctor

28:10.105 --> 28:11.907
to perform 20 operations on that leg,

28:11.941 --> 28:13.475
and it wouldn't change a thing.

28:13.509 --> 28:15.710
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.381
I know you want to fight for this.

28:20.416 --> 28:21.649
And I would, too.

28:21.683 --> 28:24.118
But, uh, you have to ask yourself,

28:24.153 --> 28:26.754
are you fighting for the right thing?

28:26.788 --> 28:29.958
Do you want a leg, or do you want a life?

28:29.992 --> 28:31.559
We got five kids.

28:31.593 --> 28:33.894
I've always taken care of my family.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.629
I'm not about to become their problem.

28:37.266 --> 28:39.267
The pain that you're going through

28:39.301 --> 28:41.436
is gonna become a bigger problem for them

28:41.470 --> 28:43.170
than any amputation could.

28:45.606 --> 28:48.141
Maybe it already is.

28:48.176 --> 28:51.078
He's right, Dean.

28:51.112 --> 28:52.912
What, are you taking his side now?

28:52.947 --> 28:55.582
I'm not taking anybody's side.

28:55.616 --> 28:59.249
You're a mess. You're angry all the time.

28:59.431 --> 29:00.988
I won't have you care for a cripple.

29:01.022 --> 29:03.023
You have to stop using that word.

29:03.057 --> 29:04.624
Listen, I know this sounds crazy,

29:04.658 --> 29:06.259
but maybe losing that leg is the one thing

29:06.294 --> 29:07.861
that's gonna make you feel normal again.

29:12.199 --> 29:16.002
I'm having a hard time imagining
how my life would even work.

29:16.036 --> 29:18.704
Yeah, you trust the people that love you.

29:18.738 --> 29:20.172
That's how it'll work.

29:20.207 --> 29:21.540
This isn't the 1950s.

29:21.574 --> 29:23.142
I mean, the prosthetics we're using now...

29:23.176 --> 29:26.278
I mean...
people are climbing mountains with them.

29:26.313 --> 29:27.613
They're...

29:29.516 --> 29:32.618
Don't think of this as giving up.

29:32.652 --> 29:36.389
Think of it as getting rid of the
one thing that's holding you back.

29:44.497 --> 29:45.697
Dr. Lin.

29:45.732 --> 29:47.165
What's up?

29:47.199 --> 29:49.668
Apart from me not having
any surgeries lately.

29:49.702 --> 29:52.370
I went to take a blanket for Natalie Dryden.

29:52.405 --> 29:54.406
She's not in her bed.

29:57.510 --> 29:59.176
We've got a missing patient...

29:59.210 --> 30:01.211
female, 30s, lacerations on her head.

30:03.248 --> 30:04.715
Come on.

30:04.750 --> 30:06.417
There it is... splenic artery.

30:06.451 --> 30:08.185
- Whatever you're doing, do it fast.
- You suture.

30:08.219 --> 30:10.855
Mm-hmm.

30:10.889 --> 30:14.559
Dr. Reid, what the hell are
you doing with my patient?

30:14.593 --> 30:16.260
I tried to find you. She was bottoming out.

30:16.294 --> 30:17.727
Well, you should have tried harder.

30:17.762 --> 30:20.263
- Dr. Levine...
- And you, Dr. Curtis...

30:20.297 --> 30:22.599
I should have thought you
would have known better.

30:22.633 --> 30:23.934
B.P.'S in a nosedive, Alex.

30:23.968 --> 30:25.234
We don't have time to talk right now,

30:25.269 --> 30:26.937
but I will explain it to you later.

30:26.971 --> 30:29.539
You're a junior surgeon who
thinks she knows everything.

30:29.574 --> 30:31.875
What do you have to explain to me?

30:31.909 --> 30:33.109
My patient is...

30:33.143 --> 30:34.410
Dr. Levine,

30:34.445 --> 30:36.345
Dr. Reid is saving this patient.

30:36.380 --> 30:38.648
Whatever you've got to say,
you can say it outside of this O.R.

30:43.454 --> 30:45.588
Let's get back to work.

30:49.460 --> 30:51.727
Natalie, what are you doing?

30:51.761 --> 30:54.097
I, uh, have to find my purse.
I have to get back to work.

30:54.131 --> 30:56.765
You're in no shape to leave.
You could have died today.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.968
Dr. Lin, I thank you for everything
that you tried to do for me.

30:59.002 --> 31:00.403
I really do.

31:00.437 --> 31:02.138
You're almost through the worst.

31:02.172 --> 31:05.039
If you leave now, you have to start over.

31:05.074 --> 31:06.774
- Where are you gonna go?
- I'll-I'll come back.

31:06.809 --> 31:09.277
I will. Today... this is just...
this is a bad day for me.

31:09.312 --> 31:10.445
Natalie.

31:11.747 --> 31:14.716
I'm not on leave from work. They fired me.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.118
I know.

31:16.152 --> 31:18.753
And my family... they're gone, too.

31:18.787 --> 31:20.255
I know.

31:20.289 --> 31:23.225
So, it's just you and me
and a problem we can solve.

31:23.259 --> 31:25.160
You don't know why they're gone.

31:25.194 --> 31:28.662
I can't even, um, say it out loud.

31:28.696 --> 31:31.765
I... even if I fix myself,
I can't ever fix that.

31:32.867 --> 31:34.768
That is all in the past now.

31:34.802 --> 31:37.638
I just... I thought that
if I could push myself,

31:37.672 --> 31:39.806
if I could just try to be something,

31:39.841 --> 31:42.243
but... I did, and now I'm this,
and I'm stuck,

31:42.277 --> 31:44.778
and I don't know anymore
if I can't break free

31:44.812 --> 31:47.981
or if I just don't want to.

31:48.016 --> 31:50.117
Okay.

31:51.219 --> 31:54.254
I can get you long-term
treatment for your alcoholism.

31:55.523 --> 31:57.423
This may be your last chance.

31:57.458 --> 32:00.627
Don't you want to take that?

32:03.964 --> 32:05.665
No.

32:21.714 --> 32:25.617
You were right about Dean.
He agreed to the amputation.

32:25.652 --> 32:29.254
That's good. I'm glad to hear it.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.892
I'm gonna ask to have your wife's X-rays

32:33.926 --> 32:35.661
sent from her family doctor,

32:35.695 --> 32:39.798
but, um, before I do that,
I'd like to hear your story.

32:39.832 --> 32:42.033
My story is I didn't kill my wife.

32:43.902 --> 32:45.769
But it's my fault she's gone.

32:45.804 --> 32:48.806
You said that, uh,
she tried to hang herself

32:48.840 --> 32:50.675
two years before she died.

32:51.843 --> 32:53.777
I didn't tell anyone.

32:53.812 --> 32:55.746
She begged me not to.

32:57.916 --> 33:00.117
You're only as sick as your secrets.

33:00.151 --> 33:02.186
Isn't that what they say?

33:02.221 --> 33:05.456
Well, I kept hers.

33:05.490 --> 33:11.429
And now she's gone,
and I'm... here... a prisoner.

33:13.498 --> 33:15.832
The medical examiner said he found evidence

33:15.866 --> 33:17.900
of a broken hyoid bone in her throat,

33:17.935 --> 33:19.469
said it was consistent
with patterns of abuse,

33:19.503 --> 33:20.837
not patterns of suicide attempts.

33:20.871 --> 33:22.505
I told you about the medical examiner.

33:22.540 --> 33:25.041
Yeah, you said that some of his
cases have been overturned.

33:25.075 --> 33:27.444
A couple of them so far.

33:30.248 --> 33:32.415
Did you kill your wife?

33:32.450 --> 33:35.418
No. I didn't.

33:38.922 --> 33:40.857
I loved her.

33:49.233 --> 33:51.734
Thanks for listening, Charlie.

33:54.437 --> 33:56.605
Okay, I don't see any more blood.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.040
Looks like we can close.

33:58.075 --> 33:59.575
She's stable.

33:59.609 --> 34:01.543
Wayne...

34:01.578 --> 34:03.079
Thank you for what you said.

34:04.314 --> 34:06.749
Never yelled at a surgeon before.

34:06.784 --> 34:09.385
I think I liked it.

34:09.418 --> 34:11.286
Well, I hope you never do it to me.

34:11.321 --> 34:13.255
Will you close Patrick?

34:13.290 --> 34:14.723
Mm-hmm.

34:16.626 --> 34:18.893
I'm going to explain to Dawn,
but don't worry.

34:18.928 --> 34:21.530
Whatever happens, I'll make
sure it only happens to me.

34:21.563 --> 34:24.966
Easy, Spartacus.

34:25.001 --> 34:26.302
I've got your back.

34:27.469 --> 34:29.137
Thank you.

34:39.186 --> 34:40.132
Alex

34:40.271 --> 34:41.559
did you operate on Dr. Levine's patient

34:41.609 --> 34:43.076
without her knowledge?

34:44.312 --> 34:45.545
Yes, I did.

34:45.579 --> 34:47.547
I tried to reach you.

34:47.581 --> 34:51.217
And when she couldn't,
she snuck the patient into the O.R.

34:51.252 --> 34:53.053
I heard about the chest tube.

34:53.331 --> 34:56.172
You are lucky she didn't
have a collapsed lung.

34:56.222 --> 34:58.025
Alex, you should have told me about this.

34:58.059 --> 35:00.059
Not now.

35:00.093 --> 35:02.292
Dr. Curtis asked me to deliver this.

35:02.446 --> 35:04.230
He said it was urgent.

35:05.766 --> 35:08.411
Believe it or not, I was trying to
protect you from the consequences.

35:08.501 --> 35:11.399
The only person facing
consequences here is you.

35:11.507 --> 35:13.139
Clara...

35:15.910 --> 35:18.011
You need to look at that.

35:24.751 --> 35:26.452
How's the patient doing?

35:26.486 --> 35:27.953
She's okay.

35:27.987 --> 35:30.322
Good.

35:30.357 --> 35:33.325
The splenic artery?

35:33.360 --> 35:35.061
Yes.

35:37.097 --> 35:39.098
How did I miss that?

35:39.132 --> 35:41.600
It could have happened to anyone.

35:41.634 --> 35:43.169
Not to me.

35:43.203 --> 35:46.705
Five years ago,
this never would have happened.

35:49.376 --> 35:50.842
Could you excuse us, please?

35:51.624 --> 35:53.045
Yes. Of course.

36:09.295 --> 36:11.096
Clara, you've had a bad run.

36:11.130 --> 36:13.966
Mm. I know.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.468
And it's gone on long enough.

36:17.502 --> 36:20.370
I need to walk away.

36:20.405 --> 36:23.240
I've been afraid to. I've...

36:25.010 --> 36:30.280
I've been afraid of the nothing
that is waiting for me.

36:30.315 --> 36:31.682
Clara...

36:31.717 --> 36:33.718
Please.

36:33.752 --> 36:35.119
It's time.

36:55.039 --> 36:56.640
Hey. Someone found this.

36:58.375 --> 37:00.243
Put it in lost and found.

37:00.277 --> 37:02.078
She won't be back.

37:02.113 --> 37:03.479
Okay.

38:06.842 --> 38:08.442
Hey. I need you to get a cake.

38:10.412 --> 38:12.613
From Benaroia's,
not that grocery-store garbage.

38:54.956 --> 38:58.024
There you go.

39:00.627 --> 39:02.862
Your limbs seem to be in one place.

39:02.896 --> 39:05.030
Dawn didn't draw and quarter you.

39:05.065 --> 39:07.266
Thanks to you, Dr. Curtis.

39:07.300 --> 39:09.468
Levine is retiring.

39:09.502 --> 39:11.971
Or Dawn has decided to retire her.

39:12.005 --> 39:13.873
Don't tell anybody
about this morning, okay?

39:13.907 --> 39:16.142
- Mum's the word.
- Thank you.

39:16.176 --> 39:19.278
Oh, Dr. Hamza I will miss you...

39:19.312 --> 39:21.113
and our chess games.

39:21.148 --> 39:22.848
Don't know why. You always lost.

39:22.883 --> 39:25.183
Okay, I guess it's
not the chess games I'll miss.

39:25.217 --> 39:26.450
It's you.

39:26.485 --> 39:28.486
Ah, well, I will miss you, too.

39:29.755 --> 39:31.823
Will you be visiting us soon?

39:31.857 --> 39:33.224
Probably not.

39:33.259 --> 39:34.458
Mm.

39:34.493 --> 39:35.994
Dr. Levine.

39:36.028 --> 39:37.829
Dr. Hamza, can I talk to
you for just one second?

39:37.863 --> 39:39.664
Mm-hmm.

39:39.698 --> 39:41.565
I just wanted to wish you the
very best for your retirement.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.234
Oh. I'm sorry. You are...?

39:43.269 --> 39:45.970
- Maggie Lin.
- Maggie. Yes, of course.

39:46.005 --> 39:47.204
Thank you.

39:47.238 --> 39:50.040
Um, I think I'll take off now,

39:50.074 --> 39:52.242
before somebody tries to make a speech.

39:55.579 --> 39:56.847
Dr. Levine...

39:56.881 --> 39:58.215
Don't say anything.

39:58.249 --> 40:01.985
I think after four decades here,

40:02.020 --> 40:04.387
I've earned the right to the last word.

40:05.756 --> 40:09.059
It's a very different world
from when I was starting out.

40:09.093 --> 40:12.162
The snickering
and the accidental gropings

40:12.197 --> 40:14.230
and the second-guessings of your work,

40:14.264 --> 40:15.532
although I think in that department,

40:15.566 --> 40:17.166
we've come full circle.

40:17.201 --> 40:20.269
Listen, I-I didn't mean
to go behind your back.

40:20.304 --> 40:22.038
I am truly sorry.

40:22.072 --> 40:24.374
No. Don't be. That's my point.

40:24.408 --> 40:26.609
It is easier for you.

40:26.644 --> 40:28.611
But you still have to prove yourself

40:28.646 --> 40:30.112
more than any male surgeon.

40:30.147 --> 40:34.116
Every day you come to work,
you have to be perfect.

40:34.151 --> 40:36.453
I hope you're up for that.

40:36.487 --> 40:38.254
I hope so, too.

40:44.094 --> 40:46.061
Dr. Singh, it's Maggie Lin.

40:46.095 --> 40:48.263
I've thought about your offer,

40:48.297 --> 40:50.932
and I would love to take the job.

40:50.967 --> 40:52.968
Call me. Thanks.

41:06.916 --> 41:10.585
Have you come to gawk at my patient again?

41:10.619 --> 41:13.588
No, actually. I came to talk to you.

41:14.690 --> 41:16.758
How was your day?

41:16.792 --> 41:18.058
Mm.

41:18.093 --> 41:20.595
Long, strange, stressful.

41:20.629 --> 41:22.497
You?

41:22.531 --> 41:25.633
You know, same old, same old.

41:25.667 --> 41:29.069
You know, we're together now,
the three of us.

41:29.104 --> 41:32.506
That means we share
the good stuff and the bad.

41:32.540 --> 41:33.941
I know.

41:33.975 --> 41:36.310
It... it really is nothing.

41:36.344 --> 41:38.545
No, Charlie...

41:40.548 --> 41:42.649
Is it a ghost thing?

41:42.683 --> 41:45.920
Yeah. I guess I'm kind of

41:45.954 --> 41:49.523
still getting used to talking about that.

41:49.557 --> 41:52.759
Well, so am I.

41:52.794 --> 41:55.729
And sometimes it can be a...

41:59.866 --> 42:02.302
I don't want you to worry.

42:02.336 --> 42:05.471
I won't.

42:07.408 --> 42:08.841
Okay.

42:15.983 --> 42:17.683
Well, the evidence
might not prove you're innocent,

42:17.717 --> 42:20.686
but it definitely doesn't
prove you're guilty, either.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.455
You don't know how long I've waited

42:22.489 --> 42:24.657
to hear somebody say that.

42:24.691 --> 42:26.724
If I'm gonna help you,
it's still on my terms.

42:26.759 --> 42:28.026
You got it.

42:28.061 --> 42:29.661
No promises.

42:29.695 --> 42:31.496
Understood.

42:31.530 --> 42:34.299
But if everything I'm seeing is right...

42:34.334 --> 42:36.835
You might have a good shot at an appeal.
