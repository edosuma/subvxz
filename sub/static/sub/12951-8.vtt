WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:03.999
Previously on Alias

00:04.000 --> 00:05.999
I had toxicology analyze the
glass of wine

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
that somehow made its way into
my house last week.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.499
They found a compound called VTX

00:11.500 --> 00:14.000
which counteracts the effects of
sodium morphate.

00:16.500 --> 00:20.000
Sodium morphate is the poison I
used to... end Emily's suffering.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.965
I see two possibilities here.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.500
Either Emily predicted your
intention to euthanize her,

00:26.535 --> 00:29.000
took the necessary countermeasures

00:29.500 --> 00:32.000
or the more likely scenario...

00:32.400 --> 00:35.100
someone wants you to believe
Emily's alive

00:35.400 --> 00:37.900
Sydney.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.900
You know Mr. Sark.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.900
I don't think we've ever
been officially introduced.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.100
Mr. Sark is now cooperating with us in
our ongoing search for Derevko and the
remains of her company.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.000 --> 01:33.665
Are you here to wish me luck being
my first day on the job

01:33.700 --> 01:37.000
or are you convinced I might reveal to
Sloane that you conspired to kill him?

01:37.035 --> 01:40.565
I'm here to remind you what
I hope is obvious

01:40.600 --> 01:42.899
but I don't want to overestimate
your intelligence.

01:42.900 --> 01:47.000
If you burn me, I burn you.

01:47.035 --> 01:48.099
Sydney,

01:48.100 --> 01:53.800
I couldn't reveal to Sloane that you
conspired to kill him without also
revealing my involvement.

01:53.835 --> 01:56.700
Of course, I never had any intention of
going through with it.

01:56.735 --> 01:58.699
I simply needed to gain his trust.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.265
You know what I think?

02:01.300 --> 02:05.800
You're just a dog looking for a new master.

02:05.835 --> 02:08.199
No need to worry, Sydney,

02:08.199 --> 02:14.165
we're colleagues now.

02:14.200 --> 02:20.200
I'll see you at the office.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.900
Sloane wouldn't agree to partner with him
unless Sark made it worth his while.

02:26.935 --> 02:28.399
Do you have any idea what they're after?

02:28.400 --> 02:33.100
Given the scope of Sark's previous contacts
and operations, he could be offering
almost anything.

02:33.135 --> 02:37.800
What concerns me more is that your mother
Knew we were double agents before she
turned herself in.

02:37.835 --> 02:41.300
She may have told Sark.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.499
I'll find out.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.599
Before you do, consider this...

02:44.600 --> 02:48.365
two months ago she surrendered to the CIA.

02:48.400 --> 02:54.400
Yesterday, Sark made a back-door agreement
with Sloane that places him inside SD-6.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.165
Do you believe that's just a coincidence?

02:58.200 --> 03:01.450
As you know, Mr. Sark surrendered
to us last week.

03:01.485 --> 03:04.665
After an extensive debriefing
with McCullough,

03:04.700 --> 03:07.965
we've concluded he can provide us with
credible intel.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.800
Enough, in fact, to warrant an immunity deal
in exchange for his cooperation.

03:12.835 --> 03:16.267
Sir, I believe this decision is
a critical mistake.

03:16.302 --> 03:19.665
This man has murdered hundreds
of people for profit.

03:19.700 --> 03:25.500
We should not set the precedent of granting
immunity to a terrorist no matter what he says
he has to offer.

03:25.535 --> 03:28.765
Yes, well, I understand your frustration,
Agent Dixon,

03:28.800 --> 03:33.200
but I believe that Sark's cooperation
will save more lives than he's taken.

03:33.235 --> 03:37.465
I'm with Dixon on this.

03:37.500 --> 03:41.300
We have developed a strategy
to address your concerns.

03:41.335 --> 03:43.199
Jack.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.665
In order to maintain Sark's value
as an informant,

03:45.700 --> 03:48.700
his contacts must not be aware that he's
turned himself in.

03:48.735 --> 03:49.999
Beginning today,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.565
whenever Sark leaves this office

03:52.600 --> 03:55.750
a security section team will double
as his private detail

03:55.785 --> 03:58.900
to ensure that he doesn't violate his
agreement with us.

03:58.935 --> 04:00.799
I, uh, I'm sorry I'm late.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.300
Marshall Flinkman,
technical operations officer.

04:04.335 --> 04:05.499
Hi. Welcome.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.165
Don't kill me.

04:09.200 --> 04:13.600
Look, I understand that none of you
are inclined to believe a word I say

04:13.635 --> 04:14.799
but I assure you,

04:14.800 --> 04:18.165
it's not in my best interest to betray you.

04:18.200 --> 04:22.500
You've given me an opportunity of a
lifetime, and I don't intend to squander it.

04:22.535 --> 04:25.600
So that's how Sloane and Sark have
presented their new partnership.

04:25.635 --> 04:29.865
No one at SD-6 likes it but they
all believe it.

04:29.900 --> 04:34.700
I need to know if you've ever told Sark
that I'm a double agent.

04:34.735 --> 04:40.700
Sydney, no.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.299
You saved Vaughn's life.

04:45.300 --> 04:48.965
I'm grateful to you for that

04:49.000 --> 04:54.200
but I haven't made up my mind yet if I
should trust you.

04:54.235 --> 04:57.065
And yet here you are.

04:57.100 --> 05:01.400
I never told Sark about your status as
a double agent, Sydney.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.865
That doesn't mean you're safe.

05:04.900 --> 05:08.500
Tell me, what intelligence has he
provided Sloane?

05:08.535 --> 05:10.599
Zoran Sokolov.

05:10.600 --> 05:15.365
A freelance mercenary who's had
extensive dealings with Mr. Sark.

05:15.400 --> 05:20.000
Yes, he frequently offers me the chance
to purchase intelligence before he brings
it to the black market.

05:20.035 --> 05:24.700
Recently he asked me if I'd be interested in
obtaining a set of communication codes

05:24.735 --> 05:27.900
used by Uzbekistan's ground forces
along the border.

05:27.935 --> 05:29.599
If we don't obtain those codes

05:29.600 --> 05:33.765
Sokolov will sell them to extremist rebels
hiding in neighboring Tajikistan.

05:33.800 --> 05:39.500
With those codes, they can track Uzbek
troop movements and plan terrorist attacks.

05:39.535 --> 05:42.565
This would gravely destabilize
our allies in Asia.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.465
Sydney, you and Dixon will make contact
with this Sokolov.

05:45.500 --> 05:51.200
Posing as Sark's associates, you will
purchase the codes and bring them here.

05:51.235 --> 05:54.917
We both know Sloane doesn't care about
preserving stability in Asia

05:54.952 --> 05:58.726
so my question is why does he want those
communication codes so badly?

05:58.761 --> 06:02.500
I'm going to ask you to give me something
you have no reason to give.

06:02.535 --> 06:06.365
I'm going to ask for your faith.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.800
You have to convince your superiors
to let me leave this place.

06:10.835 --> 06:11.399
What?!

06:11.400 --> 06:13.299
- For forty-eight hours.
- Are you serious?

06:13.300 --> 06:14.599
- I'll agree to a special forces escort.
- Why?

06:14.600 --> 06:15.099
- I cannot tell you that.
- Go where?

06:15.100 --> 06:17.099
- If you do not trust me, I cannot help you later.
- What are those codes for?

06:17.100 --> 06:18.999
- I'm trying to help you...
- How am I going to sell this?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.599
...but I must be allowed to do it MY way.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.599
Yeah, well, it's asking too much!

06:22.600 --> 06:24.899
I cannot give you details because
I don't trust the CIA.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.765
They almost had me executed two weeks ago.

06:27.800 --> 06:32.000
The only way for me to maintain my value is
to tell you only what you need to know

06:32.035 --> 06:33.799
in order to stay ahead of Sloane.

06:33.800 --> 06:39.300
And all you need to know now is that if
I'm not allowed to leave,

06:39.335 --> 06:45.300
everything you've worked to accomplish
will be lost.

06:46.700 --> 06:49.800
Agent Bristow, you're asking me to get
Irina Derevko a forty-eight hour...

06:49.835 --> 06:51.099
I'm asking you to consider it.

06:51.100 --> 06:51.999
But you can't tell me why.

06:52.000 --> 06:52.899
She won't say why.

06:52.900 --> 06:56.900
Sloane tasked you to acquire Uzbekistan's
ground force communication codes.

06:56.935 --> 06:58.299
And how does success or failure risk
what we've been...

06:58.300 --> 07:00.599
My mother's clearly worried about
something else.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.465
Some unintended consequence
that we can't predict.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.400
Sir, thus far, Derevko's intel has been
right one hundred percent of the time.

07:06.435 --> 07:09.665
We didn't catch this woman.
She turned herself in.

07:09.700 --> 07:14.000
She's agreed to be escorted by a special
forces team and wear a tracking device.

07:14.035 --> 07:16.565
She will not get away.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.599
Jack, you've been awfully quiet.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.200
I'm sorry. When it comes to
Irina Derevko,

07:21.235 --> 07:23.599
my judgment's proven to be...

07:23.600 --> 07:25.999
impaired.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.400
Well, I would like your opinion.

07:29.435 --> 07:30.099
Perhaps they're right.

07:30.100 --> 07:34.150
Perhaps releasing her is worth the risk
to satisfy our curiosity.

07:34.185 --> 07:38.165
Well, hell, when you put it that way,
the answer's definitely no.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.900
If Irina Derevko wants out of here,
she's going to have to tell us more.

07:40.935 --> 07:42.999
Otherwise, you're to proceed as planned.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
Agent Vaughn will give you
your countermission.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.499
Thanks.

07:51.500 --> 07:56.800
You told Kendall your judgment wasn't to
be trusted and then agreed with me to
reinforce his doubt.

07:56.835 --> 08:02.800
Kendall's ego predisposes him to favor
decisions in which he is overruling others.

08:04.200 --> 08:10.200
You argue your way, I'll argue mine.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.499
Your countermission's simple.

08:16.500 --> 08:22.500
You'll dead drop a copy of the codes when
you get back from Uzbekistan so we can
figure out what they're really for.

08:25.200 --> 08:31.200
I have to go pack.

08:40.299 --> 08:43.164
I must admit, this is one of the most
impressive operations I've seen.

08:43.200 --> 08:48.000
Though it is a touch pathetic how so many
of them believe they actually work for the CIA.

08:48.035 --> 08:53.765
Look at me.

08:53.800 --> 08:57.850
You've offered me a substantial prize
to make our partnership worthwhile,

08:57.885 --> 09:01.900
but do not think for a second that gives
you the right to insult my people.

09:01.935 --> 09:07.900
I apologize.

09:08.500 --> 09:14.265
I had a run-in with Sydney Bristow
this morning.

09:14.300 --> 09:18.800
She may be the only one who suspects
I haven't in fact turned myself in.

09:18.835 --> 09:22.500
I've been a presence in Sydney's
life since she was born.

09:22.535 --> 09:25.300
Sydney will believe whatever
I tell her to.

09:25.335 --> 09:27.699
And her father?

09:27.700 --> 09:31.500
He must often battle the temptation
to tell her the truth about SD-6.

09:31.535 --> 09:35.265
I'd hate to see Jack's paternal
instincts compromise our objectives.

09:35.300 --> 09:41.300
So, for the time being, I wouldn't tell
him what those codes are really for.

09:48.000 --> 09:48.599
Yeah?

09:48.600 --> 09:53.200
Sir, a call's been routed to you
through Credit Dauphine.

09:53.235 --> 09:54.599
Take a message.

09:54.600 --> 10:00.600
He says it's regarding your wife.

10:02.100 --> 10:08.100
That will be all.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.299
Put him through.

10:11.300 --> 10:16.300
I want you to record this call.

10:16.335 --> 10:17.999
Hello?

10:18.000 --> 10:21.565
We have your wife, and, yes,
she's alive.

10:21.600 --> 10:26.250
You will provide us with the account
numbers for all SD-6's investments

10:26.285 --> 10:30.900
or the Alliance will be informed that
you failed to carry out her execution.

10:30.935 --> 10:34.700
Offer me proof that she's alive.

10:34.735 --> 10:39.165
Until then, know this:

10:39.200 --> 10:41.199
as soon as I hang up the phone

10:41.200 --> 10:46.100
I will use every available resource to
find out who I'm talking to

10:46.135 --> 10:48.965
and when I do,

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
it will be my sincere pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

10:57.600 --> 11:03.600
Uzbekistan

11:17.700 --> 11:20.265
So, um...

11:20.300 --> 11:22.299
you work for Sark.

11:22.300 --> 11:25.700
Tell him I'm insulted he didn't
come here personally.

11:25.735 --> 11:31.700
We'll make sure he gets the message.

11:34.800 --> 11:38.700
Mr. Sokolov, we're on a schedule.

11:38.735 --> 11:44.217
Do you have the codes?

11:44.252 --> 11:49.700
Do you have the money?

12:05.900 --> 12:09.765
Wait.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.099
The codes are on a computer
in this case.

12:12.100 --> 12:15.565
The case, before I stole it,

12:15.600 --> 12:19.865
belonged to a colonel in the
Uzbek army.

12:19.900 --> 12:23.500
What I didn't realize when
I made the offer to Sark

12:23.535 --> 12:28.265
is that without the colonel's
fingerprint

12:28.300 --> 12:34.300
the case cannot be opened without detonating
a self-destruct mechanism inside.

12:35.300 --> 12:38.165
Boom!

12:38.200 --> 12:42.000
Are you telling us you cannot deliver
what you've promised us?

12:42.035 --> 12:43.199
Please.

12:43.200 --> 12:48.350
I wouldn't have asked you to
come all this way

12:48.385 --> 12:53.500
without a solution to this
little problem.

12:54.400 --> 13:00.400
I have arranged for Colonel to be someplace
tonight where you can take his prints.

13:01.800 --> 13:07.800
How exactly did you do that?

13:12.600 --> 13:18.600
I had him assassinated.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.299
Are you in yet?

14:23.300 --> 14:25.599
That microchip you gave me is not exactly
state of the art.

14:25.600 --> 14:31.600
It's still reading morgue records
off the central server.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.899
Okay, Dixon, I'm in.

14:44.900 --> 14:45.899
Me, too, Sydney.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.099
Stand by.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.899
What was Colonel's name?

14:48.900 --> 14:50.299
Vasili Kabilov.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.999
Sydney, you're looking for
Vasili Kabilov.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.265
ID tag C16.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.199
Where are the woman's papers?

14:59.200 --> 15:05.200
I need to log her into the system.

16:16.700 --> 16:22.700
David, the body's gone.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
Check the freezer.

17:16.200 --> 17:22.200
In the morgue.

17:26.099 --> 17:27.499
Dixon, don't shoot!

17:27.500 --> 17:28.299
It's me!

17:28.300 --> 17:34.300
Get in!

17:36.800 --> 17:39.999
Los Angeles

17:40.034 --> 17:43.199
I know.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.999
Sydney told me about
Project Christmas,

17:45.000 --> 17:48.465
about how it was developed to
identify future spies

17:48.500 --> 17:51.900
and now you're worried because you think
the Russians might have used it to recruit
American children back in the '80s?

17:51.935 --> 17:52.499
About that...

17:52.500 --> 17:53.699
The thing is,

17:53.700 --> 17:55.599
I think there might be something
to your theory.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.699
Really?

17:56.700 --> 17:59.600
Remember those weird test questions you
gave me, the ones that the KGB developed?

17:59.635 --> 18:00.399
I found them.

18:00.400 --> 18:06.400
I found them integrated into a series
of standardized tests that were
administered here in 1982.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.899
How many kids took that test?

18:08.900 --> 18:13.465
Five million.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.699
Well, look, I didn't think Devlin...

18:15.700 --> 18:17.499
my superior... would mind me having
you research this,

18:17.500 --> 18:22.000
but he did and he ordered me
to let you go.

18:22.035 --> 18:25.067
Hold on. Wait a second.

18:25.102 --> 18:28.099
There's something here.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.000
Okay, look, I'll narrow the test scores
down to a small group of kids.

18:31.035 --> 18:33.299
Now Devlin won't be able to deny
the value of that.

18:33.300 --> 18:37.700
He thinks since you're a journalist, since
you've been trained to report what you know,

18:37.735 --> 18:42.500
that you're a security risk.

18:42.535 --> 18:45.065
Don't sweat it.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.699
Here's what I owe you.

18:46.700 --> 18:47.999
There's seven hundred in there.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.099
I didn't work that many hours.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.899
Seriously, I don't know how you
did it so fast.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.899
I told you to take your time.

18:52.900 --> 18:56.065
Thanks, but, um,

18:56.100 --> 18:58.800
my time's all I expect to
get paid for.

18:58.835 --> 19:04.800
All right.

19:08.800 --> 19:13.465
Hey.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.499
What's wrong?

19:15.500 --> 19:16.699
Nothing.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.499
Nothing?

19:18.500 --> 19:20.099
Nothing's wrong?

19:20.100 --> 19:21.999
Syd...

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
if we just met, I would know
something's wrong.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.665
Do you remember Mr. Sark?

19:39.700 --> 19:43.200
Do I remember the guy who shot me
with a tranquilizer?

19:43.235 --> 19:45.299
The guy who had me tortured in Taipei?

19:45.300 --> 19:48.065
He's working with SD-6.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.400
I can't tell you any more than that.

19:51.435 --> 19:53.799
You've seen him?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.399
You're working with him?

19:55.400 --> 19:56.899
I have to make him think I am.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.600
That little British cocky
son of a bitch is in LA?

19:59.635 --> 20:02.465
Hey, Syd, I'm on-line with the spa.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.300
Did you want to get a Swedish
or a Shiatsu massage?

20:05.335 --> 20:07.965
Uh...

20:08.000 --> 20:09.899
You have to reschedule.

20:09.900 --> 20:15.000
Believe me, there is nothing I would rather
do than spend a day with you at the spa.

20:15.035 --> 20:16.499
How about next week?

20:16.500 --> 20:17.999
Next week's great.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.749
But I am still gonna go tomorrow.

20:20.784 --> 20:23.499
Okay, I want to kill that Sark guy.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.199
I know.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.699
No, this is gonna drive me insane,
you know that.

20:25.700 --> 20:26.599
Will, you asked me to tell you.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.799
I know I did. I just didn't know
it was going to be a nightmare.

20:28.800 --> 20:28.899
He's almost killed me, too.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.199
I know, but you get to do something
about it, you know?

20:31.200 --> 20:37.200
I mean, yeah, you get to go off and
be sneaky and ultimately destroy the guy.

20:37.235 --> 20:41.800
What about your work with Vaughn?

20:41.835 --> 20:47.565
Vaughn sort of fired me.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.865
The CIA's just going to ignore everything
Will found out?

20:50.900 --> 20:53.700
Actually, when Devlin heard that five
million American first graders

20:53.900 --> 20:56.700
took a standardized test that may have
been doctored by the KGB

20:56.735 --> 20:58.599
he sent Will's research to the FBI.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.599
And?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.199
We're still waiting for the results.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.065
That's the second time
Will has come through for us,

21:04.100 --> 21:06.499
I wish there were more I could do
for him, I really do.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.600
He's a good guy.

21:09.635 --> 21:10.599
Thanks.

21:10.600 --> 21:16.600
Syd...

21:20.800 --> 21:24.365
This watch belonged to my father.

21:24.400 --> 21:29.900
It's broken now, but it used to
keep perfect time.

21:29.935 --> 21:32.965
And when he gave it to me,

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
he said,
"You could set your heart by this watch."

21:41.000 --> 21:44.100
It stopped on October 1st,

21:44.135 --> 21:50.100
the day we met.

22:03.800 --> 22:09.800
Kendall.

22:11.300 --> 22:17.300
Me too.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.699
What's going on?

22:22.700 --> 22:25.900
We just heard from analysis about
the codes you acquired in Uzbekistan.

22:25.935 --> 22:27.499
Sloane and Sark gave us a half-truth.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.800
The codes are Uzbek but they have nothing
to do with troop communications.

22:30.835 --> 22:31.999
What are they for?

22:32.000 --> 22:35.065
They're the control codes for six portable
nuclear warheads

22:35.100 --> 22:41.100
that the Uzbeks have admitted and defense
intelligence has confirmed went missing
six months ago.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.965
SD-6 is in possession of six nuclear weapons?

22:45.000 --> 22:49.700
No. This morning Sark electronically
messengered the codes to an unknown third party.

22:49.735 --> 22:50.599
We couldn't trace the link.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.500
And all we know about them is that
they're working with Sloane and Sark?

22:53.535 --> 22:56.100
Why did Sloane keep you in the
dark on this?

22:56.135 --> 22:57.099
I don't know.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.700
This is what my mother was talking about.

22:59.735 --> 23:00.999
We should have listened to her.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.700
Well, if she was so concerned about
helping us stay ahead of SD-6,

23:04.735 --> 23:06.499
she could have told us what
was at stake.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.099
And what would you have done?

23:08.100 --> 23:11.865
Given Sydney false control codes
to hand over to SD-6?

23:11.900 --> 23:15.900
Sark may have known the difference and she
would have been exposed as a double agent.

23:15.935 --> 23:20.500
I wasn't willing to risk her life that way.

23:20.535 --> 23:23.000
Do you know where the nukes are?

23:23.035 --> 23:25.099
Yes, I do.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.099
Where?

23:27.100 --> 23:31.100
I've spent the last thirty-six nights
lying on a steel mattress.

23:31.135 --> 23:32.599
And what the hell is that supposed
to mean?

23:32.600 --> 23:36.400
It means I would appreciate
a pillow and blanket.

23:36.435 --> 23:37.599
Done.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.199
Tell us about the warheads.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.899
They're in Kashmir,

23:40.900 --> 23:43.800
under what used to be a
maximum security prison camp.

23:43.835 --> 23:46.300
It's now the stronghold for
a mercenary group...

23:46.335 --> 23:48.399
The People's Revolutionary Front.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.400
So Sloane and Sark have in fact
partnered with this organization?

23:51.435 --> 23:52.699
It would appear.

23:52.700 --> 23:55.099
Can you give us the prison camp's
exact coordinates?

23:55.100 --> 23:55.999
Yes.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.299
I'm going to recommend to the defense
department an immediate air strike.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.599
When the smoke clears we can dig the
warheads out of the rubble.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.699
I wouldn't do that.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.999
Now that the PRF has the control codes,

24:05.000 --> 24:09.400
they may have set the warheads to detonate
in the event of sabotage or a preemptive strike.

24:09.435 --> 24:11.399
What about sending in a commando unit?

24:11.400 --> 24:15.500
If they were familiar with the facility,
I'd say it was a good idea.

24:15.535 --> 24:18.200
That's what you were planning on doing.

24:18.235 --> 24:19.399
Yes.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.899
That's impossible to verify.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.199
All right, Miss Derevko.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.499
You're going to lead us into that prison.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.299
Oh, no, I'm not.

24:25.300 --> 24:29.265
My offer expired the moment the
detonation codes were acquired.

24:29.300 --> 24:33.700
Do I have to remind you that your immunity deal
is contingent upon your continued cooperation?

24:33.735 --> 24:36.200
I have cooperated, Agent Kendall.

24:36.235 --> 24:38.965
You didn't listen.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.799
Now, if you'd bring me my pillow and blanket...

24:40.800 --> 24:43.300
No, you listen to me. I'm authorized
to put you in solitary.

24:43.335 --> 24:44.699
You're lucky you have a view of this hallway!

24:44.700 --> 24:46.499
Agent Kendall...

24:46.500 --> 24:52.500
may I speak to my mother alone please?

25:04.900 --> 25:05.899
Sydney, I'm sorry.

25:05.900 --> 25:10.100
You said you didn't tell us the truth because
you were trying to protect me,

25:10.135 --> 25:14.300
because you didn't want to risk Sark
finding out that I was a double agent.

25:14.335 --> 25:15.799
The thing is,

25:15.800 --> 25:19.300
someone now has the ability to detonate
six nuclear weapons

25:19.335 --> 25:22.665
and I am responsible.

25:22.700 --> 25:28.300
So I am going to be part of the team that
finds and disarms those warheads

25:28.335 --> 25:31.465
no matter what you do.

25:31.500 --> 25:36.600
But if you were telling the truth when you
said you wanted to protect me,

25:36.635 --> 25:38.699
then, Mom...

25:38.700 --> 25:44.700
I need your help.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.065
You convinced your mother to go to Kashmir.

26:06.100 --> 26:11.000
I told her if she didn't lead the team to
the warheads, I would.

26:11.035 --> 26:13.399
I handed those codes to SD-6.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.599
Your guilt is unfounded.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.900
You were doing your job.

26:17.935 --> 26:20.099
I'm going, Dad.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.499
Defense approved it.

26:22.500 --> 26:28.500
I am not about to let Irina Derevko near
six nuclear weapons supervised only by you.

26:29.700 --> 26:35.700
Plane leaves in an hour.

26:49.700 --> 26:53.550
Obviously you can't maintain your cover
if you're shackled.

26:53.585 --> 26:57.400
So there are two things you need
to know about this necklace.

26:57.435 --> 26:58.899
One, it's layered with C-4.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.899
If you remove it while it's armed,

27:00.900 --> 27:03.600
you'll break the circuit
and it will detonate.

27:03.635 --> 27:06.065
And two,

27:06.100 --> 27:10.900
if at any moment I believe you're
attempting to escape or sabotage us,

27:10.935 --> 27:15.317
I'll activate this remote trigger...

27:15.352 --> 27:19.700
...and blow your head off myself.

27:32.900 --> 27:36.265
All right, here's how this works.

27:36.300 --> 27:40.200
Derevko will detail your infiltration
into the facility once you reach it.

27:40.235 --> 27:42.665
Until then, you have operational control.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.900
The unrest in Kashmir has caused both
Pakistan and India to seal their borders

27:45.935 --> 27:48.099
so you'll board a train in New Delhi.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.500
There's a three-mile stretch of track that
passes through the eastern tip of Kashmir.

27:51.535 --> 27:52.999
That's where you'll get off.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.565
Your gear will be planted
in the baggage car.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.265
Once you're off the train you'll
rendezvous with the CIA contact

27:58.300 --> 28:00.800
who will provide you with the op tech
you'll need to infiltrate the facility.

28:00.835 --> 28:02.399
How did you clear this with Sloane?

28:02.400 --> 28:03.299
I took care of Sloane.

28:03.300 --> 28:06.000
There's a C-5 prepped and waiting at
the Van Nuys airport.

28:06.035 --> 28:09.300
They'll escort you.

28:09.335 --> 28:15.300
Good luck.

28:17.100 --> 28:23.100
I'll talk to you
when you reach the contact.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.500
Agent Vaughn has trouble sleeping

28:50.535 --> 28:53.717
when you're in the field.

28:53.752 --> 28:56.899
I doubt he told you that.

28:56.900 --> 29:00.200
He didn't have to tell me,
I could see it in his eyes.

29:00.235 --> 29:02.299
I can see it in yours.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.965
Agent Vaughn is my colleague.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.265
You're so willing to take risks
for your country.

29:08.300 --> 29:10.699
Why aren't you willing to do the same
for your own happiness?

29:10.700 --> 29:14.100
I hardly think you've earned the right
to give anyone relationship advice.

29:14.135 --> 29:17.000
Jack, Sydney's smart and she's strong,
but she's not happy.

29:17.035 --> 29:18.799
Okay, wait a second, this...

29:18.800 --> 29:22.900
And after a twenty-year absence, you've
gleamed that from the cumulative half-hour
you've spent in her presence?

29:22.935 --> 29:24.699
I knew it the moment I saw her.

29:24.700 --> 29:25.499
I'm her mother.

29:25.500 --> 29:28.900
Your motherhood is a biological fact with
no substantive value in Sydney's life!

29:28.935 --> 29:30.999
Hey!

29:31.000 --> 29:33.199
Stop baiting him.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.665
And stop being such an easy target.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.299
We're going to be traveling together
for the next two days,

29:37.300 --> 29:43.300
you can't jump down her throat every
time she opens her mouth.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.599
Hope I didn't pull you away
from something too important.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.699
No, it's all right.

29:58.700 --> 30:01.765
What's up?

30:01.800 --> 30:06.100
Look, except for you, Sydney, and Jack,
everybody I know...

30:06.135 --> 30:08.199
and a lot of people I don't...

30:08.200 --> 30:11.265
they think I'm a lying junkie, okay?

30:11.300 --> 30:14.065
And helping you, doing something
for the CIA,

30:14.100 --> 30:17.300
it felt like a chance to do something
that mattered again, you know?

30:17.335 --> 30:19.699
Like, I don't know,

30:19.700 --> 30:22.900
maybe I went through all this crap
for a reason.

30:22.935 --> 30:24.099
What is this?

30:24.100 --> 30:30.100
I know you can't pay me,
it doesn't matter.

30:30.135 --> 30:31.699
You're looking at forty names.

30:31.700 --> 30:37.200
Those are forty kids that got a perfect score
on the standardized test that included
the Project Christmas questions.

30:37.235 --> 30:38.499
How did you get this?

30:38.500 --> 30:43.800
Between '80 and '85, Carnegie Mellon conducted
a cultural bias study on standardized testing.

30:43.835 --> 30:45.899
Not only did they have the results,

30:45.900 --> 30:48.099
but they cross-referenced them
by name and ethnicity.

30:48.100 --> 30:50.800
The FBI has been trying to narrow down
a list of kids for as long as you have

30:50.835 --> 30:53.099
and so far they haven't come up
with a single name.

30:53.100 --> 30:57.400
That's probably because they don't know
that the test records from '82 were missing
from the testing service archives.

30:57.435 --> 30:58.599
What do you mean, they're missing?

30:58.600 --> 31:02.900
Who took them?

31:02.935 --> 31:07.200
I don't know yet.

31:07.235 --> 31:13.200
New Delhi

31:23.600 --> 31:25.699
What is the purpose of your visit
to India?

31:25.700 --> 31:27.399
Family vacation.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.749
We're touring the Kaziranga
national park by train.

31:29.784 --> 31:32.099
Not exactly a vacation
when you're forced to go.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.599
No offense. Cute country.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.899
Honey, we agreed we'd spend
Thanksgiving together.

31:35.900 --> 31:38.500
Yeah, before I found out all my
friends were going to be in Miami.

31:38.535 --> 31:40.199
Okay, we're not going to talk
about this now.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.849
I do apologize.

31:42.884 --> 31:45.499
Enjoy your stay.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.099
Thank you. -Thank you.

31:47.100 --> 31:49.199
That is a lovely necklace
you're wearing.

31:49.200 --> 31:54.800
An anniversary gift from my husband.

31:54.835 --> 32:00.800
Thanks!

32:11.500 --> 32:12.799
Huh?

32:12.800 --> 32:16.000
I'm sorry, I was trying to call
information.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.965
Perhaps I can help.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.399
They'll be at the rendezvous at 22:00.

32:21.400 --> 32:25.065
I understand.

32:25.100 --> 32:31.100
The CIA contact has been activated.

32:38.900 --> 32:42.765
You miss, are in sleeper "G"

32:42.800 --> 32:48.800
and Mr. and Mrs. Godson, you are right
next to her in sleeper "H."

32:53.100 --> 32:54.899
The rest of your luggage will be
in the cargo hold.

32:54.900 --> 32:55.699
Thank you.

32:55.700 --> 33:01.700
Thanks.

34:13.100 --> 34:15.764
That bridge is the point of no return.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.565
If you're lying about this,
none of us will survive.

34:18.600 --> 34:21.699
I'd offer to go first but I don't want
to be accused of trying to escape.

34:21.735 --> 34:23.299
We go at the same time!

34:23.300 --> 34:24.099
Sydney, you follow.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.199
That's not safe.

34:25.199 --> 34:28.600
These winds are too strong,
our chutes could get tangled.

34:28.635 --> 34:29.399
You go first.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.599
I'm not letting you out of my sight!

34:30.600 --> 34:31.998
You go first.

34:32.000 --> 34:32.799
You'll have to trust me sometime!

34:32.800 --> 34:34.299
Trust is the last thing
you're getting from me!

34:34.300 --> 34:36.099
The only reason you know about
the nukes is because of me.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.199
I want some respect.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.599
We'll miss our window unless you jump!

34:38.600 --> 34:44.600
Shut up!

35:05.200 --> 35:06.599
I told you to follow us once we jumped.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.799
We were going to miss our window.

35:07.800 --> 35:11.600
Sydney, I need to know I can count on you
whether you agree with me or not.

35:11.635 --> 35:16.767
Okay.

35:16.802 --> 35:21.900
There.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.499
Agent Bristow, so good to see you again.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.599
It's been a long time, Saeed.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.999
This is my daughter, Sydney.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.800
Ah, your reputation is beginning
to rival your father's.

35:35.835 --> 35:38.765
Nice to meet you.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.165
Saeed Akhtar, Irina Derevko.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.265
She's assisting us on loan
from FBI custody.

35:45.300 --> 35:48.700
Your last name's Akhtar, but your
accent has a trace of Hindi.

35:48.735 --> 35:51.265
My mother is from Jammu.

35:51.300 --> 35:54.700
Your parents were brave to marry,
knowing the prejudice they'd face.

35:54.735 --> 35:58.465
Let's get moving.

35:58.500 --> 36:02.700
I have everything you need to
infiltrate the prison camp undetected.

36:02.735 --> 36:06.265
MBGs, kevlar BDUs,

36:06.300 --> 36:10.265
encryption sat-comms, three pounds
of C-4 charges,

36:10.300 --> 36:13.700
and a cryo-3 radiation detector to
help you locate the nukes.

36:13.735 --> 36:15.599
How far away is the PRF stronghold?

36:15.600 --> 36:16.499
Nine hours.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.899
Outside Muzaffarabad.

36:17.900 --> 36:23.900
None for her.

36:36.300 --> 36:38.765
Sir, this was sent to the mail room.

36:38.800 --> 36:42.100
We scanned it for biological
contaminates.

36:42.135 --> 36:48.100
It's clean.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.299
Back up.

37:46.300 --> 37:52.300
Jack? -Back up now!

38:24.700 --> 38:30.700
International aid workers here.

38:35.800 --> 38:41.000
I am disgusted one of my own
countrymen would assist the CIA.

38:41.035 --> 38:43.099
I assume you speak for your unit?

38:43.100 --> 38:44.299
Yes.

38:44.300 --> 38:47.200
We know you're looking for the
People Revolutionary Front.

38:47.235 --> 38:49.800
We thought we'd make it easy for you.

38:49.835 --> 38:55.065
Here we are.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.099
Is there something you'd like
to tell us?

38:57.100 --> 38:59.499
We'd like the warheads
you've acquired.

38:59.500 --> 39:05.500
I'm sure.

39:22.400 --> 39:28.400
Thank you for the supplies.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.399
Are you okay?

40:26.400 --> 40:27.999
It's just a scratch.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.099
Drop it.

40:30.100 --> 40:30.899
Dad...

40:30.900 --> 40:36.900
Quiet!

40:38.100 --> 40:42.600
Jack, we're in enemy territory

40:42.635 --> 40:47.065
and the PRF knows we're here.

40:47.100 --> 40:53.100
We need to start trusting
each other right now.

40:53.500 --> 40:59.100
You will not carry a weapon.

40:59.135 --> 41:04.965
Okay.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.900
Looks like we're about twenty
miles southwest of Azad.

41:07.935 --> 41:10.717
We can contact the CIA station chief
in Pakistan.

41:10.752 --> 41:13.499
He'll patch us through to Langley
on a secure line.

41:13.500 --> 41:19.500
We should make it by dawn.
