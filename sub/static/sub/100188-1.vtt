00:28.959 --> 00:31.376
Tell me the one
about the day we met.

00:31.501 --> 00:34.959
I was walking past the
coffee shop, lost,

00:35.084 --> 00:37.376
and you were standing outside.

00:37.501 --> 00:39.334
I said, "You look like a girl

00:39.376 --> 00:40.834
"who's looking for something."

00:40.917 --> 00:43.001
Mmm.
The call centre.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.209
Inspiration.

00:44.292 --> 00:47.001
Well, first and foremost,
the call centre.

00:47.042 --> 00:48.626
I had a job interview.

00:50.709 --> 00:52.709
Tell me about the
next time we met.

00:53.501 --> 00:55.001
You were driving a tram.

00:55.042 --> 00:56.292
It wasn't even my tram.

00:56.334 --> 00:59.126
It was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

00:59.209 --> 01:01.792
- Still?
- Always.

03:13.251 --> 03:14.626
Tyler!

03:23.126 --> 03:24.667
The way I see it,

03:24.792 --> 03:27.834
girls are tied to beds
for two reasons -

03:28.709 --> 03:30.042
sex...

03:30.834 --> 03:32.251
..and exorcisms.

03:33.001 --> 03:34.667
So, which was it with you?

03:34.751 --> 03:36.292
What time is it?

03:37.126 --> 03:38.959
Time is irrelevant.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.251
Where did you sleep?

03:43.334 --> 03:44.584
I didn't.

03:44.667 --> 03:47.084
I Fonzed it on the roof

03:47.126 --> 03:49.542
with a spritzer
and my shades on.

03:49.626 --> 03:50.667
Eyyyy!

03:52.292 --> 03:54.834
Whoa there, Bambi. Up.

03:57.126 --> 03:59.459
We need to be at
the restaurant for 5:30.

03:59.542 --> 04:01.709
Ugh! Enforced family fun.

04:01.792 --> 04:04.584
I need to piss.

04:05.834 --> 04:07.042
Whoa!

04:08.751 --> 04:11.417
Fine. I will piss in your bed.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.334
We might as well
prepare for the future.

04:13.417 --> 04:15.709
One day, it's just gonna be
you and me,

04:15.834 --> 04:18.334
lying around,
pissing all over each other.

04:18.416 --> 04:19.375
Mm-hm.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.709
- The golden years!
- Ah!

04:26.626 --> 04:27.917
How's your hue?

04:30.542 --> 04:33.001
White piss good,
amber piss bad.

04:33.126 --> 04:34.709
You need to hydrate.

04:34.834 --> 04:35.792
Fancy a spritzer?

04:35.917 --> 04:38.042
I think I'm about to start
my period. Are you?

04:38.501 --> 04:40.209
Of course. The moon
has married us both.

04:40.334 --> 04:42.917
That old troublemaker?
Do we have any sanitary products?

04:43.001 --> 04:45.001
Ugh. Those abominations?

04:45.084 --> 04:46.751
We're boycotting them,
remember?

04:46.834 --> 04:50.001
God forbid our bodies should
soil the soft furnishings.

04:50.042 --> 04:51.167
God forbid

04:51.251 --> 04:53.751
our reality should ruin
the big, jazzy fantasy!

04:53.834 --> 04:54.709
Do we, though?

04:55.876 --> 04:58.667
First things first.
Let's get you a loosener, hmm?

04:58.709 --> 04:59.584
Definitely.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.251
Oh, and let's get Jean out after.
She needs a break.

05:02.376 --> 05:05.084
Oh, how the mighty fall.
Real estate!

05:05.167 --> 05:06.376
Undoubtedly.

05:06.459 --> 05:08.626
Your wee sister
has forgotten how to live.

05:08.667 --> 05:10.626
We must remind her.

05:10.709 --> 05:11.667
There.

05:13.709 --> 05:14.876
How could Jean resist?

05:26.542 --> 05:31.417
The night is a zoo
and the next day is its museum.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.917
She just made that up.
Off the top.

05:37.501 --> 05:38.959
I'm a writer.

05:39.042 --> 05:40.792
She's writing a novel.

05:43.001 --> 05:44.209
Got a pen?

05:50.792 --> 05:52.001
Doesn't matter.

05:53.751 --> 05:55.292
Oh, yeah.
Right up here is good.

06:08.084 --> 06:09.501
Agh! Just keep the change.

06:11.584 --> 06:12.792
Greetings, team.

06:12.876 --> 06:14.042
- Hey.
- Hello!

06:14.126 --> 06:15.417
We've got shots, Jeannie. On me.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.334
Oh! Hark at Daddy Warbucks!

06:17.376 --> 06:18.667
How are you feeling, Dad?

06:18.709 --> 06:20.167
Yeah, did they call yesterday?

06:20.209 --> 06:22.251
Yeah, how's the cancer, Bill?

06:22.334 --> 06:24.459
They'll have to find
another way to get rid of me.

06:24.542 --> 06:26.042
I'm not going yet.

06:26.084 --> 06:29.292
- Hey, here is to that, huh?
- Jeannie?

06:29.376 --> 06:31.834
- Where's mine?
- Dr Flood said none.

06:31.917 --> 06:34.209
Dr Flood doesn't know
how to live.

06:34.292 --> 06:35.876
A Guinness will be good
for my soul.

06:35.959 --> 06:38.126
Fuck, Bill.

06:38.167 --> 06:40.209
How's your family, Tyler?

06:40.292 --> 06:43.042
They're fine.
And very, very far away.

06:43.876 --> 06:44.917
Here's to a good night.

06:45.001 --> 06:46.292
Absolutely, yeah.

06:49.167 --> 06:52.251
Let's go out after.
Like old times, yeah?

06:52.334 --> 06:54.751
Besides, I have a lot more
to stick around for now,

06:55.126 --> 06:58.334
with your impending
literary success and...

06:58.376 --> 06:59.667
And...

06:59.751 --> 07:01.751
And?

07:03.251 --> 07:04.292
What?

07:04.834 --> 07:05.792
Sis...

07:07.001 --> 07:08.126
..I'm pregnant.

07:08.584 --> 07:10.001
Oh, shit!

07:10.126 --> 07:12.376
- No, I want it!
- Oh!

07:13.709 --> 07:15.792
Hooray!

07:16.876 --> 07:18.292
You're going to be an aunty.

07:18.334 --> 07:20.792
I...

07:20.834 --> 07:23.667
I'm just...I'm thrilled
for you, Jeannie.

07:23.792 --> 07:26.292
Really, it's...
it's wonderful news.

07:26.417 --> 07:27.959
We're clearing out
the spare room

07:28.042 --> 07:30.209
so we can have a nursery
at our place.

07:31.001 --> 07:33.042
I've been waiting so long
to be a grandma.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.917
I didn't even know
you were trying.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.334
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

07:44.459 --> 07:46.167
Ah!

07:46.292 --> 07:47.709
OK, bitches.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.709
It's kitty time!

07:57.667 --> 07:59.042
Oh! Oh, God!

07:59.126 --> 08:00.917
Fuck! Whoo!

08:01.001 --> 08:02.709
Jeannie, fuck!

08:02.792 --> 08:04.459
Sorry, lads.

08:04.542 --> 08:06.584
I didn't mean to get
all holy on you there

08:06.626 --> 08:08.292
with my burning bush.

08:11.459 --> 08:14.126
So, to our latent
literary superstar.

08:14.167 --> 08:16.251
- Oh!
- How's the novel?

08:16.376 --> 08:19.292
- Oh, it's getting there.
- Must be a tome by now.

08:19.334 --> 08:20.751
How long have you been
writing it?

08:21.626 --> 08:23.959
I don't know. Since, uh...

08:24.084 --> 08:27.709
Since we met, so, uh... Hmm.

08:27.834 --> 08:30.417
You can't just toss
these things off. You know?

08:30.542 --> 08:32.876
Art is hard. It's laborious.

08:33.001 --> 08:34.376
It's not like
other things in life

08:34.458 --> 08:36.501
that can just happen...
by accident.

08:37.626 --> 08:39.876
Have I really been writing it
for 10 years?

08:41.126 --> 08:42.333
A decade?

08:42.376 --> 08:46.209
So, you have, what,
a few hundred pages?

08:46.251 --> 08:49.751
10. I have 10 pages.

08:54.251 --> 08:56.876
Hey, don't you sweat it, OK?

08:57.459 --> 09:01.167
Ezra Pound took 57 years
to write The Cantos.

09:01.751 --> 09:04.042
And the days
are not full enough.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.209
And the nights
are not full enough.

09:06.334 --> 09:07.751
And life slips by

09:07.834 --> 09:11.167
like a field mouse
not shaking the grass.

09:12.834 --> 09:15.001
Most families don't understand
that it takes years

09:15.084 --> 09:17.542
to write something
that's really good.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.667
But you guys are different.

09:20.001 --> 09:23.959
You get it. You know?
You're her...team!

09:25.126 --> 09:27.792
Right, it's getting late.
We should order.

09:27.917 --> 09:29.876
Yeah. Starving, actually.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.876
The smugness was tangible.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.376
Do you think I'm a failure?

09:43.167 --> 09:44.084
No.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.751
The fairytale is the failure -

09:47.376 --> 09:48.667
of imagination!

09:49.459 --> 09:51.792
I'm not really a writer,
though, am I?

09:52.167 --> 09:56.834
I'm a tinkerer. I tinker.
In between frothing milk.

10:02.292 --> 10:05.292
Come on.
Let's go realign our chakras.

OK. Give me...eight minutes.
OK?

11:10.126 --> 11:12.376
Large dry white wine, please.

11:12.751 --> 11:14.459
We only have one kind
of white wine.

11:15.084 --> 11:16.084
Fine.

11:16.126 --> 11:18.751
You could always go to a wine bar
if you want a selection.

11:18.876 --> 11:21.042
I don't need to go
to a fucking wine bar.

11:21.167 --> 11:23.459
I've been coming here
for 15 years.

11:42.292 --> 11:43.834
Give me two tequilas.

11:44.251 --> 11:45.417
Now you're talking!

11:59.001 --> 12:00.876
Oh!

12:02.834 --> 12:05.042
I come in here
at least once a week

12:05.167 --> 12:06.584
and it's a lot nicer than me.

12:06.709 --> 12:09.959
My dad isn't a thief, although
he probably knows a few,

12:10.001 --> 12:11.667
and as far as I know,

12:11.751 --> 12:14.376
he's never been
anywhere near the stars.

12:16.959 --> 12:19.501
So, what do you do when you're
not standing around in bars

12:19.626 --> 12:21.667
being...enigmatic?

12:21.751 --> 12:23.792
You really want to talk
about that?

12:24.501 --> 12:27.042
I... Oh, I didn't mean
to put you on the spot.

12:27.167 --> 12:30.292
I'm a musician.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.542
I was either gonna say that
or a waiter.

12:33.626 --> 12:35.751
Oh, yeah. It's the pristine
shirt, isn't it?

12:35.834 --> 12:37.292
And the look of
haughty servitude.

12:39.251 --> 12:41.792
So, what do you do
when you're not...

12:41.876 --> 12:43.959
..standing around in bars
being insulting?

12:44.042 --> 12:46.334
I'm a...

12:47.584 --> 12:48.501
..barista.

12:48.626 --> 12:50.084
Very cool.

12:50.167 --> 12:51.626
Fuck it. It's just work.

12:53.459 --> 12:54.376
Jim.

12:56.167 --> 12:57.126
Laura.

13:00.126 --> 13:01.417
Ooh.

13:03.792 --> 13:05.834
Well, who's your fancy friend?

13:06.459 --> 13:09.667
Jim, this is Tyler.
Tyler, this is Jim.

13:09.751 --> 13:11.959
Notable broad about town.
Charmed, I'm sure.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.251
Well, I just fell in here

13:14.292 --> 13:16.292
for a quick nightcap
on the way home, so...

13:16.334 --> 13:17.584
It's a good place to fall.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.417
We fall in here at least,
what, once a week?

13:19.459 --> 13:20.501
Oh, yeah.

13:20.584 --> 13:23.334
I liked your dance moves.
Especially this one...

13:26.126 --> 13:28.376
Yeah, that one's
the electrified mongoose.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.459
Yeah, it's very effective.

13:31.251 --> 13:33.001
Right, I'd better hit the road.

13:33.042 --> 13:34.876
- It's, like, 11.
- Not even!

13:34.917 --> 13:36.501
I have to be up at five, though.

13:36.542 --> 13:37.959
Hmm. Washing your hair?

13:38.667 --> 13:40.126
Practising piano.

13:40.751 --> 13:42.126
I know. What a loser, right?

13:43.001 --> 13:44.167
Massive loser.

13:44.876 --> 13:47.167
I bet you don't even have
a smartphone.

13:47.542 --> 13:50.542
No, I do. But I never take it
to work, though.

13:51.042 --> 13:53.292
Yeah, it started off
as a failsafe

13:53.334 --> 13:55.084
in case it ever went off
during a gig,

13:55.209 --> 13:57.667
and then it kind of became
a lucky thing.

13:58.876 --> 14:00.459
And I don't know my own number.

14:04.167 --> 14:05.501
What kind of person are you?

14:07.001 --> 14:08.459
A careful one.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.917
- Hmm.
- Give me your lip liner.

14:19.667 --> 14:22.917
Oh. I don't know.
Looks like a good shirt.

14:23.001 --> 14:24.751
You'd be surprised
how well it washes.

14:25.126 --> 14:27.042
All the previous numbers
have come out.

14:27.751 --> 14:30.376
All the thousands.
It's incredible, really.

14:40.751 --> 14:41.792
There.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.542
Right. Goodnight, then.

14:50.876 --> 14:52.501
Gay. Definitely.

15:04.084 --> 15:05.542
Hmm. What's this?

15:06.459 --> 15:08.042
A Dark and Stormy.

15:08.126 --> 15:09.459
What did you use for bitters?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.792
Ground-up paracetamol.

15:10.876 --> 15:14.542
Mmm. Tyler, you are a genius.

15:14.626 --> 15:16.417
I sold my soul
for mixology skills.

15:16.459 --> 15:20.084
So, who's the big fool now?
Satan, that's who! Sucker!

15:20.167 --> 15:21.917
This is the kind of drink
that undresses you.

15:22.376 --> 15:24.292
Great.
Now I've got an erection.

15:30.001 --> 15:31.667
He had the shoes
of an undertaker.

15:32.334 --> 15:35.001
And the smile of a...despot.

15:40.459 --> 15:41.709
Pull me up, I'll join you.

15:41.792 --> 15:43.251
Uh, it's fine.
I just need a slash.

15:46.042 --> 15:47.001
Ooh!

16:26.792 --> 16:28.042
- Hiya.
- Hi.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.001
Interesting choice.

16:37.959 --> 16:40.709
I suppose I'm intrigued
by all these people,

16:40.751 --> 16:42.709
jotting down notes
in their little notebooks,

16:42.792 --> 16:44.459
not actually getting anywhere.

16:45.459 --> 16:47.292
How do you know
they're not getting anywhere?

16:49.584 --> 16:51.876
Because they're still here,
trying,

16:51.959 --> 16:55.334
jotting down notes in their
little notebooks every day.

16:55.417 --> 16:58.417
Plus, it's the only place open
this early with decent wine.

17:00.334 --> 17:02.542
But the trying is the thing.

17:04.126 --> 17:07.834
I've always thought we're not
defined by who we are

17:07.876 --> 17:10.084
but by who we try to be.

17:14.209 --> 17:16.376
I always tried too hard
at school.

17:17.251 --> 17:19.459
I always did everything too hard.

17:20.251 --> 17:21.459
Who said that to you?

17:22.251 --> 17:25.751
I'm only a pianist because
I sit down and do it every day.

17:27.876 --> 17:29.501
So, leave them alone.

18:14.626 --> 18:17.209
- Ready?
- I was born ready!

18:18.667 --> 18:20.209
Whoo! Oh!

19:25.459 --> 19:29.584
Sex is a way of reminding
myself I have a body.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.542
In my 20s,
it was a way to forget.

19:31.626 --> 19:33.959
In my 30s,
it's about remembering.

19:35.167 --> 19:36.209
What?

19:37.501 --> 19:38.917
That I have a body.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.292
Go on, then. Give us a tune.

19:58.084 --> 19:59.542
- Alright.
- No!

19:59.626 --> 20:02.501
No, no, I'm kidding! You don't have to.
You don't have to.

20:02.584 --> 20:05.459
- You're worried I might be shit.
- I'm not.

20:05.584 --> 20:06.709
I'm not!

20:19.167 --> 20:20.501
Not bad.

20:25.334 --> 20:27.209
Oh. Found it.

20:27.792 --> 20:28.876
What?

20:29.001 --> 20:31.126
The room.

20:31.542 --> 20:33.251
Oh, my God.

20:33.709 --> 20:35.084
Wanker.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.542
There's always one note
in the piano

20:36.584 --> 20:37.751
that makes the room resonate.

20:37.834 --> 20:39.001
You want to avoid that one.

22:26.001 --> 22:27.334
Hello.

22:27.459 --> 22:29.001
Greetings and salutations.

22:29.126 --> 22:30.584
Oh, God!

22:30.709 --> 22:32.751
You're quoting Heathers already.
Where are you?

22:32.834 --> 22:36.501
I am sitting outside a city centre
drinking establishment

22:36.584 --> 22:38.042
and there is a chair
across from me

22:38.126 --> 22:39.792
and it is just baying
for your ass.

22:39.876 --> 22:41.126
I am writing.

22:41.209 --> 22:42.834
You've been at it
since the crack of dawn.

22:42.917 --> 22:45.084
New regime.
This is what it takes.

22:45.126 --> 22:47.292
What it takes, my friend,
is inspiration.

22:50.084 --> 22:51.417
Oh!

22:58.376 --> 23:00.667
I think you're
stressing unnecessarily.

23:00.751 --> 23:02.251
I'm not stressing.

23:02.334 --> 23:05.084
You know, it's not all about
the words on the page.

23:05.167 --> 23:07.376
Nobody wrote anything good
inside of a vacuum.

23:07.459 --> 23:09.834
Yeah, but I can't create
under the influence.

23:09.917 --> 23:13.042
That is an old romantic lie
and you know it.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.626
It worked for
Hunter S. Thompson.

23:14.709 --> 23:16.959
Hmm, did it?
Did it really, though?

23:17.584 --> 23:20.292
Fine. I'll still be here
when you change your mind.

23:20.417 --> 23:22.709
I'm not covering for you
at work tomorrow.

23:23.251 --> 23:25.917
Ugh! "Work tomorrow, work tomorrow,
work tomorrow."

23:26.001 --> 23:27.542
Baby, I've got work tomorrow

23:27.626 --> 23:29.917
every day for the rest of my life,

23:30.001 --> 23:31.626
serving mocha-fucking-chicken-lattes

23:31.709 --> 23:33.709
to students with more money
than me.

23:33.792 --> 23:35.334
I am working for The Man.

23:35.417 --> 23:36.501
And what gives?

23:36.584 --> 23:39.501
Only the fact that
there are nights in between.

23:43.209 --> 23:46.167
FYI, I'm buying.
Correction - I have bought.

23:46.709 --> 23:47.751
Come play.

23:49.042 --> 23:50.834
Come on, Lolo.

23:50.917 --> 23:54.667
How many days do we get
like this in spring? In life?

24:05.251 --> 24:06.876
What did you say
your name was again?

24:06.959 --> 24:09.542
- Chicken Sandwich.
- That's a beautiful name.

24:13.292 --> 24:15.126
Waste of fucking time
in halves, babe.

24:15.251 --> 24:17.417
- It's not the '90s.
- You got another?

24:22.917 --> 24:25.584
Whoo! Don't mind if I do.

24:33.709 --> 24:35.751
Are you together?
Or have you got fellas?

24:35.834 --> 24:38.792
She has recently succumbed,
I am rejecting the nuclear family

24:38.876 --> 24:40.334
in favour of
an enlightened life.

24:40.376 --> 24:43.167
- He is just my boyfriend.
- Oh, official?

24:49.959 --> 24:51.501
Who are you texting
at this hour?

24:51.584 --> 24:53.959
Jim. He's in Australia
having lunch.

24:54.084 --> 24:55.834
He thinks we're savages.

24:55.917 --> 24:57.792
We ARE savages.

24:57.917 --> 24:59.042
Wait.

25:00.251 --> 25:01.709
- Come on.
- Oh! Where are you going?

25:01.792 --> 25:03.292
To check our pulses!

25:03.834 --> 25:04.792
Come on!

25:15.626 --> 25:16.917
- What the fuck?
- Run!

25:21.542 --> 25:23.334
Come and get it!
Come and get it!

25:28.126 --> 25:29.501
Come on, hurry up!

25:46.334 --> 25:49.167
Mmm! Holy fuckerel!
It tastes like incest.

25:53.417 --> 25:55.042
You don't like Jim?

25:55.751 --> 25:57.334
I just don't think
you should limit yourself.

25:57.417 --> 25:59.376
- I think you could do better.
- Like who?

25:59.501 --> 26:02.376
Well, it doesn't have to be
an actual person, does it?

26:03.584 --> 26:05.167
We've got so many drugs!

26:17.126 --> 26:19.292
I am shitting, like, horribly,

26:19.376 --> 26:22.501
a Niagara torrent of diarrhoea,

26:22.584 --> 26:26.251
and he is right there
in the bath...

26:26.334 --> 26:30.167
..and he says,
"Gerberas. My favourite."

26:32.542 --> 26:34.334
Oh, God!

26:34.376 --> 26:36.626
Who knew anyone in Dublin
was into piano music?

26:36.709 --> 26:40.334
Mmm. Wall-to-wall art douches.
It's my dream Friday.

26:40.417 --> 26:42.876
Hey. It'll be grand, like.

26:43.542 --> 26:45.126
Seriously, you have to
see him in action.

26:45.167 --> 26:46.084
Mm-hm?

26:46.126 --> 26:47.167
Does he play the piano

26:47.251 --> 26:49.376
like he's making love
to a beautiful woman?

26:56.501 --> 26:58.126
Thank you. Ooh.

27:00.001 --> 27:01.417
Make way! Make way!

27:01.542 --> 27:04.251
My friend's lover is the man
of the hour. Excuse me.

27:06.417 --> 27:09.126
Oh-ho-ho! Oh, my God.

27:10.501 --> 27:12.626
I love this place.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.292
So, where's the band?

27:22.792 --> 27:24.667
- Yikes. For sure.
- For sure.

28:59.084 --> 29:01.126
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

29:21.334 --> 29:22.917
Oh, there's Jim.

29:23.001 --> 29:25.251
- Jim!
- Shh! Shh! He'll be over.

29:25.334 --> 29:27.626
- What, are we playing it cool?
- We're playing it cool.

29:27.667 --> 29:28.751
OK.

29:34.084 --> 29:34.959
Oh, Jim.

29:35.001 --> 29:36.292
Hi.

29:36.334 --> 29:38.959
- Well done, my man. Chapeau!
- Thank you.

29:39.042 --> 29:40.751
Yeah, you're quite the talent.
I will give you that.

29:41.334 --> 29:44.001
So good.
Kinda terrifying, actually.

29:44.084 --> 29:46.042
Oh, he's no more
talented than you.

29:46.876 --> 29:49.417
He's just...put his talent
into action.

29:49.501 --> 29:50.751
How do you mean?

29:50.834 --> 29:52.751
Just like yours is...you know,
it's an ongoing process.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.042
But the process is real.

29:56.126 --> 29:57.626
- I...
- Hey, Jim.

29:57.667 --> 29:58.917
- Alright?
- Well done, buddy.

29:59.001 --> 30:00.167
You had nothing to worry about.

30:00.251 --> 30:02.376
Thanks a million. Kirsten,
this is Laura and Tyler.

30:02.459 --> 30:03.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:03.501 --> 30:04.667
Laura, Tyler, this is Kirsten.

30:04.751 --> 30:08.709
She does this cool
contemporary flute thing.

30:08.792 --> 30:10.542
- "Flute thing".
- Yeah.

30:10.626 --> 30:11.876
And this is Peter on cello.

30:11.959 --> 30:13.084
Hi.

30:13.167 --> 30:15.251
- I like your jacket.
- Do you? Thanks.

30:15.292 --> 30:16.626
Well, we just came
over to say congrats.

30:16.667 --> 30:18.626
I've never seen so many people
at one of these things.

30:18.709 --> 30:19.876
You're the talk of the town.

30:19.917 --> 30:22.084
- Thanks a million.
- Congratulations.

30:22.126 --> 30:23.626
Thank you, mate. Alright.

30:23.667 --> 30:25.126
Cheers.
Thanks so much for coming.

30:25.209 --> 30:26.792
- "Talk of the town"!
- Yes, he is.

30:29.709 --> 30:31.501
We're just gonna
go and get some...

30:31.584 --> 30:32.917
- I bet you are.
- ..air.

30:33.001 --> 30:34.084
Mm-hm.

30:35.751 --> 30:36.709
Have fun!

30:44.459 --> 30:46.834
I feel so fucking naughty.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.376
Take it easy!

32:02.167 --> 32:04.626
I'm a professional.

32:10.334 --> 32:11.542
So...

32:14.042 --> 32:16.001
..I've been trying
to write a novel.

32:17.292 --> 32:18.542
For ten years.

32:22.292 --> 32:24.167
What...what's it about?

32:25.834 --> 32:28.251
About ten pages.

32:30.334 --> 32:31.292
No, it's...

32:33.334 --> 32:36.042
It's about a spider
caught in its own web

32:36.167 --> 32:38.126
and a woman who rescues it.

32:38.751 --> 32:40.084
That's the beginning, anyway.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.584
That sounds fucking beautiful.

32:47.001 --> 32:49.417
I wish I could really
get it going, you know?

32:49.542 --> 32:53.126
Or...give it up.
Not this...limbo.

32:53.167 --> 32:54.376
So, why don't you?

32:57.042 --> 32:58.959
I'm trying. I just can't...

32:59.084 --> 33:02.126
I can't write every day.
I don't have that luxury.

33:03.001 --> 33:05.667
I'm not saying you do. I...

33:05.792 --> 33:08.751
I know you work hard,
and that is...

33:09.834 --> 33:12.792
..motivating and heartening.

33:14.001 --> 33:16.667
You could quit your job
if you need more time.

33:16.751 --> 33:18.209
And live off what?

33:18.334 --> 33:19.959
I owe Tyler rent every month.

33:20.084 --> 33:21.709
That'll leave the two of us
in the lurch.

33:21.792 --> 33:22.834
Reduce your hours, then.

33:23.584 --> 33:25.917
I do bare minimum.

33:29.334 --> 33:30.709
Move in with me.

33:33.501 --> 33:36.251
You know, you could focus.

33:37.417 --> 33:39.459
Focus.

33:39.959 --> 33:41.084
Come on.

33:42.584 --> 33:44.584
Don't be a fucking amateur.

34:08.708 --> 34:10.751
Cheers, T.

34:15.001 --> 34:16.667
Oh, fuck!

34:23.458 --> 34:24.833
I love you.

34:24.958 --> 34:27.292
I love you too,
you fucking amateur.

34:27.417 --> 34:28.958
Puh-lease.

34:30.126 --> 34:31.583
Take that lightweight home.

34:43.792 --> 34:45.917
And I went inside, and...

34:46.042 --> 34:48.792
..it was an entire room
of golden ocelots.

35:00.209 --> 35:02.501
- Fucking weird!
- Isn't that mad?

35:02.626 --> 35:04.334
How do you titillate
an ocelot?

35:04.459 --> 35:05.751
Dunno.

35:05.876 --> 35:07.584
You oscillate its tits a lot.

35:09.334 --> 35:10.501
- Hiya.
- Tyler!

35:10.626 --> 35:12.167
- Hi!
- Yes. You're here. Finally.

35:12.251 --> 35:14.917
Sorry I'm late. I was just
putting out a cigarette.

35:14.959 --> 35:17.417
You should think about knocking
that on the head, you know?

35:17.501 --> 35:19.209
You won't get away with it
much longer.

35:19.251 --> 35:20.959
Mmm, yeah, see, I smoke
for health purposes.

35:21.042 --> 35:22.959
There's very good evidence
to suggest

35:23.084 --> 35:25.376
that smoking prevents
unwanted conditions

35:25.501 --> 35:28.084
such as inflammatory bowel
disease and pregnancy.

35:30.417 --> 35:32.376
So, family...

35:33.876 --> 35:35.626
..we have
a little announcement.

35:39.709 --> 35:41.167
We're engaged!

35:41.251 --> 35:43.251
Oh, my God!

35:43.376 --> 35:45.626
Congratulations!

35:45.667 --> 35:47.334
Are you sure you know what
you're getting yourself into?

35:51.042 --> 35:52.501
Aww! Amazing!

35:53.501 --> 35:54.792
Well done.

35:56.292 --> 35:58.417
I get it. You all think
I'm gonna die, don't ye?

35:58.542 --> 35:59.792
Stop!

35:59.834 --> 36:01.751
No, Dad, it's not that. I...

36:03.292 --> 36:04.251
I love him.

36:04.876 --> 36:08.542
He's good, he's dedicated,
he's talented and...

36:09.292 --> 36:11.292
..when he plays piano, oh!

36:13.126 --> 36:14.917
It's the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

36:19.584 --> 36:21.626
Will you be
my matron of honour?

36:22.876 --> 36:24.959
I'll be your matron
of dishonour.

36:30.542 --> 36:33.292
Come and have a glass of wine after,
at Jim's.

36:33.376 --> 36:35.334
A glass of wine?

36:35.459 --> 36:37.334
Who the fuck are you?

36:38.709 --> 36:42.917
Your best friend who just made
a major life decision.

36:43.542 --> 36:44.792
Come and have a fucking drink.

36:47.334 --> 36:49.459
Well, let's have one now.
Why not?

36:49.917 --> 36:52.376
Two large glasses
of white wine, please.

36:52.459 --> 36:54.626
- Uh, lime and soda, please.
- Same.

36:56.751 --> 36:58.334
Are you feeling OK?

36:58.459 --> 36:59.709
I'm fine.

37:01.501 --> 37:02.834
Are you sure you're OK?

37:04.376 --> 37:05.876
Absolutely.

37:09.876 --> 37:12.042
I'm just laying off the booze
for a while.

37:12.167 --> 37:14.251
- Work's pretty full-on.
- Ah.

37:23.042 --> 37:24.501
There's wine in
the fridge there.

37:24.626 --> 37:26.042
Help yourself. I don't mind.

37:26.626 --> 37:29.167
Oh, well, if you don't mind...

37:32.167 --> 37:34.001
You're pissed off.

37:34.084 --> 37:35.376
I'm not.

37:37.792 --> 37:39.959
Your body, your choice.

37:43.209 --> 37:45.959
Listen, I've never done
a tour like this before.

37:47.584 --> 37:49.876
I might never get
the chance to again.

37:50.584 --> 37:52.792
I know. It's just...

37:57.917 --> 38:00.084
Let's not put ourselves
out to pasture.

38:01.667 --> 38:03.584
Let's keep having adventures.

38:03.709 --> 38:05.876
I've never been as good
at partying as you.

38:07.667 --> 38:08.542
Not true.

38:09.751 --> 38:13.751
So I might not be your man for...
nocturnal adventures...

38:15.292 --> 38:17.126
..but I could be
your rugged beast.

38:19.959 --> 38:21.292
Mmm.

38:24.959 --> 38:28.334
She made me feel like
I was being unfaithful to her.

38:28.376 --> 38:30.501
No. She just loves you,
that's all.

38:31.792 --> 38:33.167
I get it.

39:07.584 --> 39:09.459
I thought I blocked
this number.

39:21.001 --> 39:24.334
No. No, I don't want any of it.

39:24.459 --> 39:26.459
I said I don't want
anything from him.

39:31.334 --> 39:33.292
Hey, what is the best drink

39:33.417 --> 39:35.084
to accompany the death
of a parent?

39:35.167 --> 39:36.876
Because I'm ready to celebrate.

40:19.209 --> 40:20.834
Define love.

40:22.459 --> 40:23.501
True freedom.

40:24.334 --> 40:27.126
Ah. So you're talking
unconditional? Not romantic?

40:27.209 --> 40:29.042
No... Well...

40:29.126 --> 40:30.709
Alright -

40:31.417 --> 40:34.584
maximum contact
with maximum freedom.

40:35.209 --> 40:37.709
Uh, that's not love.
That's a tampon ad.

40:40.459 --> 40:44.084
So, I got you this.

40:44.501 --> 40:47.001
Funny, because I got you...

40:47.959 --> 40:48.917
..this.

40:49.001 --> 40:50.959
Oh, God!

41:23.084 --> 41:26.459
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f...

41:26.501 --> 41:29.209
..f-f-fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

41:29.334 --> 41:31.042
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

41:31.167 --> 41:34.542
..ffffuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fffffff...

42:27.292 --> 42:28.917
I don't know which way
it happens sometimes.

42:29.042 --> 42:30.626
I just know it happens.

42:30.751 --> 42:32.209
That's love.

42:34.292 --> 42:37.126
You know, but that's the funny
thing about poems, right?

42:37.251 --> 42:41.001
That they reveal something new
every time you read them.

42:41.084 --> 42:44.667
And I've tried to love
other things, but, um...

42:45.084 --> 42:46.876
..words, you know, poetry,

42:47.459 --> 42:49.251
it's the only thing
that I can come back to.

42:49.542 --> 42:51.626
I mean, it's not like
my relationship with poetry

42:51.709 --> 42:53.834
has been consistent
throughout my life.

42:54.417 --> 42:56.542
I mean, luckily,
I believe all relationships

42:56.584 --> 43:01.959
are creative acts
and they grow, change.

43:02.042 --> 43:03.501
As is my love for poetry.

43:04.167 --> 43:06.209
And that's the great thing
about poems too.

43:06.251 --> 43:07.584
Like, we always...

43:07.626 --> 43:10.001
..always find something new
every time we read one.

43:24.459 --> 43:26.917
So, are you a poetry fan
or a wine fan?

43:26.959 --> 43:28.334
Poetry.

43:28.417 --> 43:29.876
But I came for the wine.

43:29.959 --> 43:32.042
Yeah. I don't blame you.

43:39.084 --> 43:42.667
See, I do. I think it's like
distilling whiskey, you know?

43:43.292 --> 43:45.459
Oh, well, the first bit's crap,
the last bit's crap,

43:45.584 --> 43:47.626
but that bit in the middle,
that's the good bit.

43:47.751 --> 43:49.084
It's the same with writing.

43:49.209 --> 43:50.917
See, I'd love to get there.

43:51.001 --> 43:54.084
I can never seem to get
beyond the first crap bit.

43:54.167 --> 43:57.584
I...I just...I can't seem
to get the clarity.

43:57.667 --> 43:59.167
I can't seem to join up the dots.

43:59.251 --> 44:01.626
Alright, so just stay up
all night pouring it out.

44:03.417 --> 44:07.334
Well, the world is full of
glorious distraction, isn't it?

44:07.417 --> 44:10.667
Well, you say distraction,
I say inspiration.

44:12.167 --> 44:14.542
I suppose you've finished
hundreds of novels.

44:14.584 --> 44:18.292
No, I, um...
I host these little salons

44:18.376 --> 44:20.667
where people can try out
their new stuff.

44:20.751 --> 44:23.959
I teach, give talks.
I'm a devoted reader.

44:24.667 --> 44:26.167
I'm what you might call
an enabler.

44:29.917 --> 44:33.042
I like the way you drink.
It's with a real sense of mortality.

44:33.126 --> 44:34.751
It's a dying art.

44:34.876 --> 44:36.792
Do you find
wine helps you write?

44:38.167 --> 44:40.709
Not really. It...

44:41.584 --> 44:44.084
..makes me care less
about whether I write or not.

44:46.209 --> 44:47.876
So, why write at all

44:48.751 --> 44:50.709
if you'd rather just...
care less?

44:54.459 --> 44:57.334
How else to rage around
the dark mansion?

45:00.001 --> 45:01.501
You know, I'm gonna
have to kiss you

45:01.584 --> 45:03.292
if you keep talking like that.

45:12.417 --> 45:13.834
I have to go.

45:15.459 --> 45:16.834
Of course.

45:34.834 --> 45:35.834
Oh!

45:43.292 --> 45:44.709
Good night?

45:44.834 --> 45:46.709
Fabulous.

45:46.834 --> 45:48.126
Gin and tonic?

45:49.709 --> 45:50.709
New regime.

45:52.209 --> 45:53.292
Huh.

45:55.792 --> 45:58.292
You know, just a reminder -
your rent is overdue.

45:58.376 --> 46:01.042
Oh, I've been staying at Jim's.
I have it. Sorry.

46:02.959 --> 46:04.292
What's up?

46:04.834 --> 46:07.584
I tried calling you the other night.
You didn't call me back.

46:09.584 --> 46:10.751
Has something happened?

46:12.042 --> 46:13.667
He's dead.

46:14.792 --> 46:15.959
Finally.

46:17.001 --> 46:18.584
Sylvia called.

46:19.126 --> 46:20.376
Fuck.

46:26.376 --> 46:28.709
No, I'm...fine.

46:30.626 --> 46:33.376
It's not the same for me
as it is for you.

46:45.959 --> 46:48.959
So, I hear
there's this dress shop

46:49.084 --> 46:51.542
that does free fizz
for brides to be.

46:52.584 --> 46:54.251
All the bubblies
you can knock back.

46:55.334 --> 46:57.334
Sounds like a challenge.

46:58.167 --> 46:59.917
Doesn't it?

47:06.417 --> 47:07.917
Can I help you, ladies?

47:08.042 --> 47:10.917
I need some kind of
wedding dress.

47:11.001 --> 47:12.959
Would you like some fizz
while you're looking?

47:13.084 --> 47:14.459
- It's complimentary.
- Yes.

47:16.209 --> 47:18.542
I just don't get this
virginal bride stuff.

47:18.626 --> 47:20.167
It's very problematic.

47:21.126 --> 47:23.626
That and the idea of
your father giving you away,

47:23.751 --> 47:25.751
as if you were a human baton

47:25.876 --> 47:28.084
being passed from
one tyrant to the next.

47:28.209 --> 47:30.459
It's...gross!

47:30.584 --> 47:32.792
That is why my dad
is not gonna give me away.

47:32.876 --> 47:35.376
It's gonna be
a very modern wedding.

47:36.209 --> 47:38.459
Ha! The state of me!

47:38.542 --> 47:42.084
The state of this whole
shit-show.

47:42.209 --> 47:45.126
I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret, my friend.

47:45.626 --> 47:47.667
There IS no such thing
as a modern wedding.

47:48.459 --> 47:50.084
All this froth,

47:50.209 --> 47:53.834
it's all prime example of
'watch the birdie' politics.

47:54.501 --> 47:56.751
Look at the cupcakes!
Look at the cupcakes!

47:56.876 --> 47:59.209
Look at the cupcakes!

47:59.292 --> 48:02.126
Meanwhile, we're gonna keep
fucking you in the ass

48:02.251 --> 48:04.334
AND paying you less.

48:04.417 --> 48:05.834
The fuck's up with you?

48:06.792 --> 48:08.709
Isn't marriage part
of the whole system

48:08.834 --> 48:11.334
we've been railing against
all these years?

48:11.376 --> 48:13.251
The stuff you do
because you feel you should

48:13.292 --> 48:15.334
rather than because
you actually want to?

48:15.459 --> 48:16.959
Yeah, but I do want
to marry Jim.

48:17.042 --> 48:18.459
No, you don't.

48:18.584 --> 48:21.626
You've just been conditioned
to feel that if you don't,

48:21.709 --> 48:24.626
your life is somehow
less valuable.

48:25.584 --> 48:28.084
Let's just have a drink.

48:28.209 --> 48:29.542
Why don't you try one on?

48:29.667 --> 48:32.042
- Ugh!
- We can do a montage!

48:32.167 --> 48:34.751
Marriage, by definition,
is archaic and oppressive.

48:35.001 --> 48:36.167
What about gay marriage?

48:37.209 --> 48:38.376
Is that a proposal?

48:38.459 --> 48:40.626
If I could marry you, Tyler, I would.

48:40.751 --> 48:43.542
I wouldn't marry you.
I wouldn't put you through that.

48:44.042 --> 48:45.334
See, I have principles.

48:45.751 --> 48:47.501
I have principles.

48:47.626 --> 48:49.292
And my feminism is about

48:49.417 --> 48:51.876
blazing a new way
through old traditions.

48:53.917 --> 48:55.501
Horse pucky!

49:02.251 --> 49:04.876
"We are not defined
by how we are,

49:05.834 --> 49:07.584
"but how we try to be."

49:19.542 --> 49:21.917
You know none of this
changes our friendship?

49:23.209 --> 49:24.876
So you're still gonna
live with me?

49:25.417 --> 49:27.001
You could get a new housemate.

49:27.084 --> 49:28.792
I don't want a new housemate.

49:28.917 --> 49:31.459
- Could be fun.
- I hate fun.

49:37.751 --> 49:39.167
I thought you liked him.

49:39.584 --> 49:40.459
I did.

49:41.917 --> 49:44.626
He's just gotten so PR-sheeny.

49:45.251 --> 49:47.917
He abbreviated the word
'interview' the other day.

49:48.001 --> 49:49.917
'Intie'!

49:51.876 --> 49:54.459
I just don't understand
why it has to be just him.

49:56.542 --> 49:57.959
He's not enough.

50:01.334 --> 50:04.126
- Can I help you, ladies?
- I'll take this one.

50:04.251 --> 50:06.584
- You're buying it?!
- I am.

50:09.001 --> 50:12.376
You could go to his for sex
and then just come home to me.

50:12.459 --> 50:16.542
See him, other lovers,
AND write, AND party,

50:16.626 --> 50:18.251
AND still be free.

50:18.376 --> 50:20.542
Why define yourself
by this one relationship?

50:21.626 --> 50:23.251
Tell me you don't want more.

50:24.459 --> 50:27.001
Why cut yourself off
from other possibilities?

50:27.084 --> 50:30.334
Other men. Women. Variety.

50:30.459 --> 50:33.084
Aren't you scared of
becoming too civilian?

50:34.834 --> 50:38.126
Tell me you haven't wanted to.
Hmm? With anyone?

50:38.584 --> 50:39.876
How are you, girls?

50:41.917 --> 50:43.584
What's the matter now, love?

50:43.667 --> 50:46.001
Is your body too bootylicious
for me?

50:46.126 --> 50:48.876
It's bored.
My body is too bored.

50:50.667 --> 50:52.709
Been shopping, have you?
What's in the bag?

50:52.834 --> 50:54.626
Blow-up dolls and ketamine.

50:59.001 --> 51:02.542
Look, this isn't you. Alright?
But it's OK.

51:02.667 --> 51:05.084
You said yes on a crazy whim,
but it's not too late.

51:05.167 --> 51:07.167
We can get you out of this,
and I'm gonna help you.

51:07.209 --> 51:08.917
- I asked him.
- What?

51:09.626 --> 51:11.376
I asked Jim to marry me.

51:17.709 --> 51:19.959
Right.

51:23.667 --> 51:26.417
Don't move a muscle,
'cause we are doing this.

51:26.542 --> 51:28.959
- We are going deep tonight.
- Yep.

51:29.084 --> 51:30.501
- You want the same?
- Definitely.

51:30.626 --> 51:32.334
Oh, wait.
I don't have any money.

51:32.376 --> 51:33.626
Oh. Hmm...

51:40.959 --> 51:42.667
- Well, I never.
- Hi!

51:44.459 --> 51:47.459
- And who might this be?
- Um...Tyler, this is Marty.

51:47.584 --> 51:50.501
He did a talk the other day
at the Wandering Dust,

51:50.542 --> 51:52.042
which was very inspiring.

51:52.167 --> 51:55.167
Marty, this is Tyler,
my best friend and flatmate.

51:55.292 --> 51:57.084
- Enchan-fucking-tée.
- Hi.

51:59.001 --> 52:00.667
Anyway, it was nice to see you.

52:00.792 --> 52:01.917
Yeah.

52:02.042 --> 52:03.376
Well, why don't you join us?

52:04.834 --> 52:07.167
OK. Um...white wine, right?

52:07.251 --> 52:08.626
Oh! Exactly.

52:11.251 --> 52:12.751
- You dirty dog.
- Shh!

52:12.834 --> 52:14.667
- Tell me everything.
- There's nothing to tell.

52:14.709 --> 52:16.001
Mm-hm!

52:16.084 --> 52:17.459
Two sisters.

52:17.584 --> 52:19.584
And I say, "OK, bozos,

52:19.709 --> 52:22.126
"what is the worst thing
you can hear

52:22.834 --> 52:24.334
"right before having sex?"

52:24.917 --> 52:26.959
"Put this horse's-tail
butt plug in"?

52:29.126 --> 52:31.334
"Call me Uncle Mo."

52:31.751 --> 52:34.417
Close! Very close. But no cigarillo.

52:37.417 --> 52:39.834
"Make a face like
you don't understand."

52:39.917 --> 52:42.251
Huh? Huh?

52:51.542 --> 52:53.001
He's perfect.

52:53.084 --> 52:54.876
For who? For you?

52:57.292 --> 52:59.417
Alright. Who fancies another?

52:59.459 --> 53:00.584
I do.

53:03.042 --> 53:04.417
Nope. I have to go.

53:04.542 --> 53:05.876
What?

53:07.667 --> 53:09.001
We have to go.

53:31.334 --> 53:32.834
Mmm...

53:54.126 --> 53:56.251
Your feet are like stones.

53:56.334 --> 53:58.751
I walked home.

53:59.792 --> 54:01.626
Is that not dangerous?

54:01.709 --> 54:03.417
Not for a wolf-woman.

54:24.376 --> 54:25.709
I love you, Jim.

54:29.042 --> 54:30.459
I love you, Laura.

54:33.209 --> 54:35.792
And I think you should leave
your wife for me.

54:48.084 --> 54:50.167
They're going to build
a statue of you.

54:50.251 --> 54:53.126
It'll be the two of us,
immortalised in marble.

54:53.251 --> 54:54.584
Recumbent.

54:57.167 --> 54:58.751
- Noble.
- Mmm.

55:02.292 --> 55:04.417
Looking lovely, girls.

55:04.542 --> 55:06.751
Playtime's over, lads.

55:08.501 --> 55:12.709
Let's just stay focussed
on the mission at hand.

55:12.792 --> 55:14.167
- The dress!
- Yes.

55:14.251 --> 55:16.126
The dress. The dress.

55:16.542 --> 55:18.292
- My dress.
- Number seven, right?

55:18.334 --> 55:19.584
Uh-huh. I think so.

55:19.626 --> 55:22.084
- It's your lucky number.
- Shut it, you filthy pimp.

55:25.376 --> 55:26.334
Marty!

55:28.126 --> 55:30.376
Well, hello.

55:30.501 --> 55:34.042
This is actually good timing.
I'm having a little salon.

55:34.126 --> 55:36.376
Just a few friends sharing
their works in progress.

55:36.417 --> 55:38.459
You guys should come up, join us.

55:38.542 --> 55:40.126
- OK!
- Yay.

55:45.084 --> 55:47.292
What have you got in there, anyway?

55:47.417 --> 55:49.001
Random thoughts.

55:49.126 --> 55:52.417
- I know!
- What?

55:52.501 --> 55:55.001
You should showcase yourself
here tonight!

55:55.084 --> 55:56.126
Mmm...

55:56.209 --> 55:58.834
You could read something
magnificent about me!

55:59.584 --> 56:00.792
You could write it right now.

56:00.876 --> 56:02.376
Come on.

56:20.042 --> 56:22.501
I can't work under
this kind of pressure!

56:22.584 --> 56:24.251
Oh, come on!
You can work something up.

56:24.334 --> 56:26.042
It's literature, not an omelette.

56:26.126 --> 56:28.376
Ugh! Please don't mention food.

56:35.917 --> 56:37.667
Yeah...

56:53.042 --> 56:55.167
Thank you, Dylan.

56:55.292 --> 56:57.834
- Yeah.
- That was fucking beautiful.

56:59.501 --> 57:00.917
- Hi.
- Hi. Mmm.

57:01.042 --> 57:03.417
Laura and Tyler,
may I introduce you

57:03.501 --> 57:06.917
to Dublin's finest
alt-minimalist poet, Gavin?

57:07.001 --> 57:11.376
I prefer to go by my nom
de plume, the Avant Gardener.

57:12.084 --> 57:13.876
Well, this is Laura,

57:13.959 --> 57:16.542
and she is gonna read
something tonight as well.

57:16.626 --> 57:17.626
- Isn't that right?
- Uh...

57:17.709 --> 57:20.792
'Cause her prose are finer
than the pubes of angels.

57:20.876 --> 57:22.959
Great.
Well, we look forward to it.

57:25.084 --> 57:26.834
Sit. Hi.

57:31.876 --> 57:32.917
That'll do. Again.

57:32.959 --> 57:35.292
Yeah.

57:38.251 --> 57:39.709
This is good whisky.

57:46.834 --> 57:50.334
Now, earlier tonight,
we spoke about beginnings.

57:50.417 --> 57:53.167
Right? About creating
a space for new ideas.

57:53.292 --> 57:56.751
No matter how unformed
or unfinished they might be.

57:56.876 --> 57:57.876
So...

58:04.626 --> 58:05.501
Gavin.

58:06.584 --> 58:07.626
Do you want to share?

58:12.876 --> 58:15.084
This is the nuclear summer.

58:16.084 --> 58:19.334
And I am thirsty...for sand.

58:21.792 --> 58:23.251
Your DM...

58:24.584 --> 58:27.376
..made me do sweat drop emojis.

58:28.292 --> 58:30.917
And I hate emojis.

58:32.917 --> 58:34.792
That's all I have
to give tonight.

58:35.459 --> 58:38.209
Hear, hear.

58:42.459 --> 58:46.126
Hey. Did you, uh...
want to share something?

58:46.251 --> 58:48.709
- Yes. Yes, she does.
- Uh...

58:48.834 --> 58:51.959
Uh, um, um...hmm.

58:52.084 --> 58:54.334
I was gonna read something

58:54.417 --> 58:57.084
about my best friend, Tyler, um...

58:57.167 --> 59:00.751
I feel like I'm always
making notes about her.

59:00.876 --> 59:05.209
But I've been looking through
my notes, and, uh...

59:05.334 --> 59:07.459
Go. Go, go.

59:07.542 --> 59:09.667
Even small tidbits are fine.

59:10.042 --> 59:12.917
It's...a bit unformed.

59:13.209 --> 59:15.334
So what?

59:16.459 --> 59:19.876
I always think of that...
Yeats poem.

59:20.709 --> 59:23.167
"With beauty like a tightened bow

59:24.001 --> 59:27.626
"The kind that is not natural
in an age like this."

59:27.709 --> 59:30.501
And why try and improve
on perfection, right?

59:30.626 --> 59:33.126
"Was there another Troy
for her to burn?"

59:33.501 --> 59:34.376
Exactly.

59:36.126 --> 59:38.417
Fucking plagiarism, Lola?

59:38.501 --> 59:41.584
Come on. You're better
than this. Read something.

59:41.709 --> 59:44.876
"Talent borrows.
Genius steals."

59:44.917 --> 59:48.167
Hmm.
I thought you were an artist.

59:50.209 --> 59:51.792
Fuck you.

59:51.834 --> 59:53.709
When and where am I supposed
to write anything new?

59:53.792 --> 59:55.834
In my beautiful apartment.

59:55.917 --> 59:58.667
A hotbed of creation!

59:59.167 --> 01:00:02.126
Yeah, about that - I think
it's time I moved in with Jim.

01:00:03.126 --> 01:00:05.959
I need to start taking things
seriously, saving some cash.

01:00:48.459 --> 01:00:50.167
So, I thought Yeats was
the perfect choice.

01:00:50.209 --> 01:00:51.167
Thank you.

01:00:51.251 --> 01:00:53.292
Although, I don't agree
with you entirely.

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:56.542
I think you need to get over
your worries about perfection,

01:00:56.626 --> 01:00:58.376
or you're never gonna
finish this novel.

01:00:58.917 --> 01:01:01.251
- Why?
- 'Cause everyone I know is writing a novel.

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:04.667
Do you know how many are
actually gonna finish one?

01:01:05.876 --> 01:01:07.667
Yeah, I think that's optimistic.

01:01:16.417 --> 01:01:18.251
Listen, we'll talk
properly tomorrow.

01:01:18.292 --> 01:01:19.667
Roger that.

01:01:24.542 --> 01:01:25.917
Mmm.

01:01:29.126 --> 01:01:31.834
So, it seems like
everyone is moving on.

01:01:32.876 --> 01:01:35.501
And I think I'm gonna go
with that Avant Gardener.

01:01:38.167 --> 01:01:39.334
Yeah.

01:01:40.042 --> 01:01:41.584
You're, uh,
welcome to stay.

01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:44.376
I can root out your dress,
call you a cab.

01:01:55.167 --> 01:01:57.501
What's an animal's primary need?

01:01:58.667 --> 01:02:00.584
- Food.
- Sex.

01:02:01.959 --> 01:02:03.376
Safety.

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:16.084
Have fun. I'll catch you later.

01:02:16.209 --> 01:02:17.792
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

01:02:17.876 --> 01:02:19.709
Alright.

01:02:41.167 --> 01:02:42.459
Do you partake?

01:02:43.334 --> 01:02:45.376
- What is it?
- Coke.

01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:48.251
Hmm. An aristocrat.

01:02:48.292 --> 01:02:50.626
Uh, something like that.

01:02:59.584 --> 01:03:00.459
Ladies first.

01:03:08.709 --> 01:03:09.959
Mmm.

01:03:15.251 --> 01:03:17.667
So, Tyler was
on fine form tonight.

01:03:17.751 --> 01:03:19.834
She gets aggressive in spring.

01:03:19.959 --> 01:03:22.001
Ah. She's quite the revolutionary.

01:03:23.126 --> 01:03:25.959
It's about owning our bodies.

01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:30.959
Curating our experiences
based on our desires.

01:03:37.667 --> 01:03:38.959
And do you?

01:03:43.917 --> 01:03:45.542
Every day...

01:03:46.542 --> 01:03:48.292
..and every night.

01:04:37.209 --> 01:04:39.417
Ah.

01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:04.501
Can you feel that, baby?

01:05:04.626 --> 01:05:08.167
Uh...not really.
It's quite off-putting.

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:10.667
Well, what about this?

01:05:13.167 --> 01:05:16.001
Listen, I ain't getting
nothing off that.

01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:18.167
OK...

01:05:23.751 --> 01:05:25.834
How about you give me some
for my nose?

01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:27.292
Or is that not the point?

01:05:29.167 --> 01:05:30.834
You want this up your nose?

01:05:30.917 --> 01:05:32.584
I'd quite like some fresh.

01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:35.751
OK.

01:06:05.042 --> 01:06:07.501
I'm...sorry, I've come over all...

01:06:08.917 --> 01:06:10.084
Engaged.

01:06:11.876 --> 01:06:13.584
Something like that.

01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:40.167
Mmm! Mmm.

01:06:55.209 --> 01:06:57.709
"..they were legion.

01:06:57.792 --> 01:06:59.667
"A fucking mess"...

01:07:07.334 --> 01:07:09.876
Hmm. OK.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.001
Eggs?

01:07:33.334 --> 01:07:34.626
Mmm.

01:07:42.501 --> 01:07:44.876
Mmm.

01:07:49.626 --> 01:07:51.834
Why don't you leave
some clothes here?

01:07:51.959 --> 01:07:53.834
You could have your own drawer.

01:07:53.959 --> 01:07:56.751
Imagine. The luxury!

01:07:56.792 --> 01:07:59.001
Leave some pants here.
I dare you.

01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:04.667
So...I'll move in here?

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:08.417
We'll live here?

01:08:10.667 --> 01:08:12.167
What did you think we'd do?

01:08:20.042 --> 01:08:21.084
Bonjour.

01:08:22.042 --> 01:08:24.042
Very nice!

01:08:24.084 --> 01:08:25.209
Right?

01:08:27.084 --> 01:08:29.667
You know we're going to them,
they're not coming here?

01:08:29.751 --> 01:08:31.834
Oh, I know.
This is all for you.

01:08:34.459 --> 01:08:38.001
So, what happened with, uh,
"O Captain! My Captain!"?

01:08:38.542 --> 01:08:40.876
- Got my dress back.
- What a relief.

01:08:43.376 --> 01:08:45.459
We're not drinking.
We're going to meet a baby.

01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:49.501
Well, I had nothing else to do
this morning, so...

01:08:51.251 --> 01:08:53.876
I lost my job, Lo.

01:08:55.917 --> 01:08:57.292
Two weeks ago.

01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:59.709
They caught me doing mandy
off the bean sacks.

01:09:01.501 --> 01:09:03.292
So I'm gonna need
your rent, like...

01:09:04.542 --> 01:09:05.792
..today.

01:09:18.001 --> 01:09:19.667
Hey!

01:09:20.792 --> 01:09:23.709
Whew! You two smell of...fun.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.376
Oh!

01:09:25.459 --> 01:09:28.626
Do try and contain yourself, Tyler.
So antisocial.

01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:30.001
Shoes, Tyler.

01:09:30.084 --> 01:09:31.459
Yes, yes.

01:09:33.376 --> 01:09:36.417
Hey, look at this! It's like
fucking Bethlehem in here!

01:09:36.501 --> 01:09:39.626
Tyler! What a lovely surprise.

01:09:39.667 --> 01:09:41.626
Jim's off to Berlin.
He sends his love.

01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:44.209
Ooh, Berlin.
Nice for some, eh?

01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:54.876
Oh, sis!

01:09:54.959 --> 01:09:56.751
We need a large bucket of ice,

01:09:56.834 --> 01:09:58.209
preferably cold, freezing.

01:09:58.292 --> 01:09:59.542
Over.

01:09:59.626 --> 01:10:01.167
For fuck's sake,
you're locked.

01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:02.292
You're right.

01:10:02.792 --> 01:10:05.501
YOU'RE 32.
It's getting embarrassing.

01:10:05.876 --> 01:10:07.709
Oh, here, someone
has to break it to you.

01:10:07.751 --> 01:10:09.542
Sooner or later,
the party has to end.

01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:10.709
Why?

01:10:10.834 --> 01:10:15.167
Because you get left behind
and you become a tragedy.

01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:18.417
Well, tragedy plus time
equals comedy.

01:10:19.459 --> 01:10:21.167
Jeannie, I've got something for you.

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:23.042
Something you're gonna like.

01:10:23.126 --> 01:10:24.792
I don't want drugs in my house.

01:10:24.876 --> 01:10:26.834
Oh, come on.
This house is full of drugs.

01:10:26.917 --> 01:10:30.834
Caffeine. Alcohol.
Your father's antidepressants.

01:10:30.917 --> 01:10:32.251
Your antidepressants.

01:10:32.334 --> 01:10:34.459
You told her
I was on antidepressants?!

01:10:34.542 --> 01:10:36.876
I was trying to convince her
you were still cool.

01:10:37.001 --> 01:10:40.459
Plus, I know what you ground up
in there last summer!

01:10:40.542 --> 01:10:42.876
The night we did
the macarena, hmm?

01:10:42.959 --> 01:10:44.709
The night we kissed?

01:10:44.792 --> 01:10:47.959
Let's do the math, shall we?
That was about...

01:10:48.042 --> 01:10:49.501
..eight and a half months ago?

01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:51.334
Shut the fuck up, Tyler,
or I swear to God,

01:10:51.417 --> 01:10:52.876
I'll run you through
with a breadknife!

01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:55.292
There she is.
Good old Jeannie.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:57.251
I knew she still had
that fighting spirit inside.

01:10:57.792 --> 01:10:59.292
This is how you want
to meet your niece?

01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:07.709
I'm breastfeeding!

01:11:07.792 --> 01:11:09.667
Oh!

01:11:15.417 --> 01:11:17.542
Oh!

01:11:17.626 --> 01:11:19.042
Christ!

01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:23.376
So, Laura, how's the writing
coming, then?

01:11:23.417 --> 01:11:25.834
Are you going to move in
with Jim before the wedding?

01:11:26.334 --> 01:11:27.209
Yeah...

01:11:27.251 --> 01:11:29.626
Actually, I thought you should
keep your room on as an office.

01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:32.167
You know what?
That's not a bad idea.

01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:34.417
What, like joint custody?

01:11:34.501 --> 01:11:36.334
And what's so wrong
with joint custody?

01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:37.792
A lot of families do it.

01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:40.001
You don't have to be
so 20th century about it.

01:11:40.042 --> 01:11:41.751
And you don't have to
always make everything

01:11:41.834 --> 01:11:43.334
so difficult and unpleasant.

01:11:43.376 --> 01:11:44.751
- Hey.
- You know she does.

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.251
Do you know I do?

01:11:48.334 --> 01:11:49.626
Aww! Mmm!

01:11:50.334 --> 01:11:53.792
Look how beautiful my niece is.

01:11:53.917 --> 01:11:56.834
Yes.

01:11:56.959 --> 01:11:59.626
Today is all about Shirley.

01:12:04.542 --> 01:12:06.042
Julian! Uh...

01:12:06.792 --> 01:12:07.792
This way, Lo!

01:12:07.876 --> 01:12:09.667
Put her down.

01:12:09.751 --> 01:12:13.251
She's fine with me.
What is your problem, Jean?

01:12:13.376 --> 01:12:15.584
You're fine with your Aunty Lo.

01:12:16.042 --> 01:12:17.876
Aren't you, Shirley, girl?

01:12:17.959 --> 01:12:19.292
- Laura...
- What? What?

01:12:23.626 --> 01:12:26.251
Laura! What is wrong with you?

01:12:26.334 --> 01:12:28.084
Uh, white wine, salt and Perrier -

01:12:28.209 --> 01:12:30.126
that's how you get red wine
out of a baby.

01:12:30.167 --> 01:12:31.917
Get her out of here!

01:12:33.876 --> 01:12:34.751
Fine.

01:12:35.834 --> 01:12:37.501
Come on, Tyler. Let's go.

01:12:39.834 --> 01:12:42.792
- Shh-sh-sh-sh.
- Darling.

01:12:44.042 --> 01:12:45.626
Did you see those cards?

01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:48.542
"Welcome to the club -
the baby club!"

01:12:48.626 --> 01:12:50.459
Let me tell you about
the baby club, my friend.

01:12:50.542 --> 01:12:51.501
The baby club is like

01:12:51.626 --> 01:12:54.292
one of those God-awful
discotheques in Temple Bar

01:12:54.334 --> 01:12:55.709
where it's packed with tourists

01:12:55.751 --> 01:12:57.126
and you can't get
a decent drink,

01:12:57.167 --> 01:12:58.709
and the minute that
somebody new walks in,

01:12:58.751 --> 01:12:59.876
everybody looks at them

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:01.917
with this fucking desperate,
manic glee,

01:13:02.001 --> 01:13:03.084
because they're so relieved

01:13:03.167 --> 01:13:05.042
that some other poor fucker
fell into their club

01:13:05.084 --> 01:13:07.334
after they paid 20 quid
and they can't leave.

01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:11.459
What?

01:13:13.459 --> 01:13:15.584
I know we come
from different places,

01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:17.834
and I am sorry about that.

01:13:21.626 --> 01:13:23.251
You're the one who spilled
the wine on the baby.

01:13:23.334 --> 01:13:25.501
- You made the martinis.
- And you drank 'em.

01:13:25.584 --> 01:13:27.334
You're just as fucked as me!

01:13:27.959 --> 01:13:29.167
Look, T, I...

01:13:32.126 --> 01:13:35.792
We will always have each other,
but there comes a time

01:13:35.917 --> 01:13:38.751
when there needs to be room
for other things.

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:43.334
Are you saying we need space?

01:13:43.376 --> 01:13:44.376
Yeah.

01:13:52.376 --> 01:13:54.292
I'm 30 next week.

01:13:54.334 --> 01:13:56.376
It's fine.

01:13:57.959 --> 01:13:59.542
Look, 30 doesn't hurt.

01:13:59.626 --> 01:14:01.501
You sound like one of those
fucking motivational cards -

01:14:01.584 --> 01:14:02.876
"Thirty isn't hurty."

01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:11.084
We said we'd be
in New York City together

01:14:11.167 --> 01:14:12.792
by the time we were 30.

01:14:22.084 --> 01:14:23.209
Wait, do you hear that?

01:14:26.626 --> 01:14:28.417
- What?
- Shhh.

01:14:35.792 --> 01:14:37.126
I don't hear anything.

01:14:39.751 --> 01:14:41.251
Exactly.

01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:45.292
It's the non-sound
of the suburbs.

01:14:47.042 --> 01:14:48.876
They sell it as peace,

01:14:50.001 --> 01:14:53.001
but really, it's just death...
closing in.

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:14.001
Morning.

01:15:16.876 --> 01:15:18.459
Want breakfast?

01:15:18.542 --> 01:15:20.917
Hmm...no, thanks.

01:15:21.001 --> 01:15:23.417
I'll just grab something
and work through.

01:15:27.001 --> 01:15:29.626
I can't believe you're even up
after such a late flight.

01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:31.417
I'm a machine.

01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:34.459
So, how did it go
meeting Shirley?

01:15:35.292 --> 01:15:37.001
Did it make you broody?

01:15:40.167 --> 01:15:41.626
Made me clumsy.

01:15:43.292 --> 01:15:44.751
I spilled wine on her.

01:15:44.834 --> 01:15:46.209
What?

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:49.584
As social faux pas go,
it is right up there.

01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:54.542
Hey.

01:15:55.876 --> 01:15:57.709
I'm letting all the sides down.

01:15:59.542 --> 01:16:01.209
You're not letting me down.

01:16:14.334 --> 01:16:15.209
What is it?

01:16:15.459 --> 01:16:17.042
- What?
- Huh?

01:16:18.251 --> 01:16:22.042
Oh, listen...I think I might
actually have to let you down.

01:16:22.792 --> 01:16:24.709
I don't think I can make it
to Tyler's party.

01:16:25.876 --> 01:16:28.876
I have a thing, a...work thing,

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:31.001
and I just need to be
super fresh, you know?

01:16:32.001 --> 01:16:34.501
What kind of work thing?

01:16:34.584 --> 01:16:37.792
It's a recital for the board.
Very fancy.

01:16:37.834 --> 01:16:41.084
And then after,
they're announcing this fellowship,

01:16:41.126 --> 01:16:42.584
and I'm short-listed.

01:16:43.167 --> 01:16:44.876
It's alright, though.
You don't have to go.

01:16:44.959 --> 01:16:47.876
That's...that's amazing, Jim!

01:16:48.001 --> 01:16:50.001
- Which day is it?
- Saturday.

01:16:50.126 --> 01:16:52.251
But you don't have to go,
honestly.

01:16:53.417 --> 01:16:54.917
Yeah, you said that already.

01:16:55.626 --> 01:16:58.084
It's fine. Tyler's party
is on the Friday.

01:16:58.167 --> 01:17:00.251
- What time is your thing?
- Two.

01:17:00.376 --> 01:17:02.376
I don't think
I can manage both, though.

01:17:02.459 --> 01:17:07.209
And you should, you know,
fully explore Tyler's party.

01:17:07.292 --> 01:17:08.334
You can't let her down.

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:12.959
I can function in your world,
you know.

01:17:13.084 --> 01:17:15.709
I know.
I never said you couldn't.

01:17:25.209 --> 01:17:26.626
You don't want me to come.

01:17:26.751 --> 01:17:28.209
Of course I do.

01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:49.251
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:17:49.376 --> 01:17:53.584
Oh! How are my two
favourite people?

01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:54.792
Happy birthday.

01:17:54.876 --> 01:17:56.917
Oh, thank you!

01:17:57.001 --> 01:17:58.417
Mmm. It's like a roux.

01:17:58.459 --> 01:17:59.792
It's worth it.

01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:01.667
- Hmm. Hmm?
- Nah.

01:18:04.167 --> 01:18:06.626
- I'm gonna grab a drink.
- Yes.

01:18:06.751 --> 01:18:08.167
How come you invited him?

01:18:09.126 --> 01:18:10.584
To keep the dream alive?

01:18:11.501 --> 01:18:13.084
What happened between you two?

01:18:13.209 --> 01:18:15.542
- Nothing.
- Mmm. Liar.

01:18:17.417 --> 01:18:19.459
- You can't breathe a word.
- Of course not.

01:18:19.501 --> 01:18:22.084
He was pure porno 1984.

01:18:22.876 --> 01:18:25.584
What? Pussy or ass?

01:18:26.876 --> 01:18:27.959
Wow.

01:18:28.834 --> 01:18:31.126
- What a waste.
- That's exactly what I said!

01:18:31.209 --> 01:18:32.292
- Right?
- Yes!

01:18:32.376 --> 01:18:34.251
Oh! Please don't leave
too early.

01:18:34.292 --> 01:18:35.459
Oh, no, I won't.

01:18:38.584 --> 01:18:39.626
Oh, I was so fucked.

01:18:39.667 --> 01:18:41.376
And I remember I tried
to go home the next day

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.292
and my mam was like...

01:19:04.834 --> 01:19:06.876
I needed a new raison d'être.

01:19:07.501 --> 01:19:09.209
I'm sorry.

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:12.501
Uh, did you want some
before we clear up?

01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:16.584
Yes.

01:19:16.667 --> 01:19:18.667
- Yeah!
- Mmmm!

01:19:24.792 --> 01:19:27.459
As long as I'm in bed
for three, it's totally fine.

01:19:27.876 --> 01:19:28.751
Totally fine.

01:19:29.167 --> 01:19:30.626
So, there was this one time

01:19:30.667 --> 01:19:32.626
that Lo and I were
at this music festival

01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:37.834
and a proper insect
fell out of Lo's vagina.

01:19:37.917 --> 01:19:40.209
- It was my pubes!
- Whatever!

01:19:40.334 --> 01:19:42.126
Whatever. It was like
a fucking tick or something.

01:19:42.209 --> 01:19:44.792
Honestly, I thought we agreed
to leave this anecdote for dinner parties.

01:19:44.834 --> 01:19:47.084
Well, anyways,
when she got home,

01:19:47.167 --> 01:19:48.709
she had to, like, shave the lot off.

01:19:48.792 --> 01:19:50.251
You know, like,
full Hollywood, right?

01:19:50.667 --> 01:19:52.292
So, when she comes out
of the bathroom

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:54.126
and I see her for
the first time, I was like,

01:19:54.167 --> 01:19:59.167
"Lo! That haircut has taken
years off of you."

01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:12.126
Mmm, so,
how does it feel to be 30?

01:20:16.167 --> 01:20:20.459
Linear time is
a trick of the light.

01:20:22.626 --> 01:20:27.417
I should probably stop
at 6am on the dot.

01:20:27.792 --> 01:20:32.251
Baby, that is so feasible,
it's verging on logic.

01:20:40.042 --> 01:20:44.376
When did everybody
get so serious?

01:20:44.501 --> 01:20:49.042
I want to go beyond
analysis tonight.

01:20:49.167 --> 01:20:52.626
I think the three of us might
be the last true dreamers.

01:20:52.751 --> 01:20:54.709
- Amen!
- I need to piss.

01:20:59.834 --> 01:21:04.417
Sometimes the best reason
is a vacation from reason.

01:21:13.667 --> 01:21:15.126
Birthdays aren't the best time

01:21:15.209 --> 01:21:17.167
for deep-and-meaningfuls,
you know?

01:21:17.292 --> 01:21:20.001
Way too much pressure.
There's too much anticlimax.

01:21:20.126 --> 01:21:21.001
No.

01:21:39.459 --> 01:21:43.251
You know that Yeats line
about choosing life or art?

01:21:43.334 --> 01:21:45.001
Yeah, The Choice.

01:21:45.126 --> 01:21:47.167
"The intellect of man
is forced to choose

01:21:47.292 --> 01:21:49.084
"Perfection of the life
or of the work."

01:21:49.209 --> 01:21:51.834
Yeah. I think that's true
for women too.

01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:58.959
When you're just running and
running and you're not sure

01:21:59.042 --> 01:22:00.376
if someone's actually
following you or not.

01:22:00.459 --> 01:22:01.584
But you just keep running.

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:03.084
And you just fucking
keep going, just...

01:22:03.126 --> 01:22:05.542
And I'm swearing that the dogs
are fucking following us,

01:22:05.626 --> 01:22:07.834
'cause every bark that we hear,
I'm like, "That's her dog."

01:22:07.917 --> 01:22:10.542
She definitely has more than
one dog when she's there.

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:12.834
- Uh-huh.
- Right. 11am.

01:22:12.917 --> 01:22:15.459
- One for the road.
- OK. Let's make it count.

01:22:22.292 --> 01:22:23.209
Are you OK?

01:22:24.459 --> 01:22:27.792
Sign of a good night.
This is the bit where I puke.

01:22:28.959 --> 01:22:30.209
Oh!

01:22:39.167 --> 01:22:40.709
Better?

01:22:40.834 --> 01:22:42.167
Much.

01:23:40.792 --> 01:23:42.417
"But by turns fascinated...

01:23:43.042 --> 01:23:45.667
"By turns fascinated
and reassured,

01:23:46.959 --> 01:23:50.542
"his mouth, his composure,
his steady, loving gaze.

01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:54.959
"In some moments, I wanted
to be owned by him."

01:23:55.626 --> 01:23:56.876
What are you doing?

01:23:58.417 --> 01:23:59.584
"Owned"?

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:00.959
That's private.

01:24:01.417 --> 01:24:04.292
Since when? Why, what is it?

01:24:04.792 --> 01:24:07.417
What is this bogus bullshit?
I don't understand.

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:10.501
I mean, who are you, Jean?

01:24:10.584 --> 01:24:12.876
You're just another one
of the fucking herd?

01:24:12.959 --> 01:24:14.917
I mean, you don't believe this?

01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:18.001
I'm leaving, Tyler.

01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:21.584
Wait, OK. Wait, wait, wait.

01:24:21.667 --> 01:24:23.251
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

01:24:24.001 --> 01:24:26.459
Don't forget your shades, huh?

01:24:26.542 --> 01:24:27.834
There!

01:24:27.917 --> 01:24:29.084
Eyyyyy!

01:24:31.292 --> 01:24:33.459
- What is your problem?
- You. This.

01:24:36.876 --> 01:24:38.542
OK. You know what?

01:24:38.584 --> 01:24:42.209
Why don't you just go the fuck
home, then, little kiddie? Hmm?

01:24:42.292 --> 01:24:44.542
Go bury your head
in some big man's lap

01:24:44.626 --> 01:24:47.667
and sleep the rest
of your life away.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:49.542
But let me tell you something.

01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:52.126
One day,
you're gonna wake up 45

01:24:52.209 --> 01:24:54.001
and you're not gonna know how.

01:24:54.959 --> 01:24:58.251
When you're old and grey
and full of sleep...

01:24:58.334 --> 01:24:59.501
Stop it!

01:25:01.417 --> 01:25:04.292
Stop with the fucking poetry!

01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:11.251
Just remember,
you bailed first, Lolo!

01:25:12.167 --> 01:25:13.626
You bailed first.

01:26:01.626 --> 01:26:02.584
Jim!

01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:11.001
Isn't this amazing?
Isn't Jim the greatest?

01:26:11.084 --> 01:26:13.501
I'm so proud of you.
You are so gonna win.

01:26:14.167 --> 01:26:15.251
Look at this place.

01:26:16.459 --> 01:26:17.876
Look at all of you.

01:26:17.959 --> 01:26:20.542
Um...uh, this is
my fiancée, Laura.

01:26:20.626 --> 01:26:21.917
Would you please look after her

01:26:21.959 --> 01:26:23.417
while I get us
a couple of drinks?

01:26:23.459 --> 01:26:24.834
She's a writer.

01:26:24.876 --> 01:26:26.959
Well...

01:26:27.042 --> 01:26:29.417
..I'm more of a typist
at the moment.

01:26:29.459 --> 01:26:31.917
I aspire to be
as dedicated as Jim is.

01:26:32.001 --> 01:26:33.501
I aspire to be a lot of things,
actually.

01:26:33.542 --> 01:26:36.834
But I-I-I'm trying to nail
the work-life balance,

01:26:36.876 --> 01:26:38.834
or more like
the work-party balance.

01:26:38.917 --> 01:26:40.209
Work hard, play hard, you know.

01:26:40.251 --> 01:26:43.542
But these days and nights
are still passing in a blur.

01:26:43.626 --> 01:26:46.667
It's like 10 years can just
slip by unnoticed.

01:26:47.251 --> 01:26:48.792
How does that even happen?
Like...

01:26:49.376 --> 01:26:52.959
A whole decade just...gone.

01:26:55.417 --> 01:26:56.667
Anyway, so, it was...

01:26:59.001 --> 01:27:00.167
Oh, fu...

01:27:00.292 --> 01:27:01.917
- Shit. Sorry.
- Oh!

01:27:05.667 --> 01:27:07.709
He's been putting himself
under so much pressure.

01:27:07.792 --> 01:27:09.959
That's OK. It's just
these shoes and this floor.

01:27:10.042 --> 01:27:11.251
Not a good combination.

01:27:11.334 --> 01:27:13.001
We can't even say
you were drunk!

01:27:13.084 --> 01:27:15.667
You know, he's not had a drink
for two months.

01:27:15.751 --> 01:27:16.751
I haven't either.

01:27:18.126 --> 01:27:19.959
It's a terrible thing, alcohol.

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:22.084
Makes...people dicks.

01:27:24.459 --> 01:27:25.501
Mmm.

01:27:25.792 --> 01:27:29.042
I'll, um...catch up with you later.
Good luck.

01:27:29.126 --> 01:27:30.209
Thank you.

01:27:31.917 --> 01:27:34.292
I'll be a few minutes.
Sorry.

01:28:25.626 --> 01:28:26.667
When?

01:28:29.126 --> 01:28:30.084
Um...

01:28:31.459 --> 01:28:32.417
Mexico.

01:28:34.167 --> 01:28:35.917
Just after we got engaged?

01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:40.959
The land of the golden ocelots.

01:28:41.042 --> 01:28:42.667
It was a drunken mistake.

01:28:44.834 --> 01:28:46.251
I was drunk.

01:28:48.751 --> 01:28:50.876
I...

01:28:56.459 --> 01:28:58.001
I feel like...

01:28:59.126 --> 01:29:01.667
..the reality of this
isn't right for either of us.

01:29:02.834 --> 01:29:04.709
The abstract of marriage
is manifesting...

01:29:04.792 --> 01:29:07.876
The reality is
me and you, Laura.

01:29:08.501 --> 01:29:10.126
That's not abstract. It's real.

01:29:10.251 --> 01:29:11.751
- Did you fuck her?
- No.

01:29:12.667 --> 01:29:13.584
No.

01:29:14.251 --> 01:29:15.667
But you touched her tits?

01:29:17.292 --> 01:29:18.667
Yeah.

01:29:36.501 --> 01:29:38.042
Did you eat her pussy?

01:30:10.501 --> 01:30:11.584
Marty?

01:30:27.792 --> 01:30:32.584
This is just a waste
of good entertainment.

01:31:44.292 --> 01:31:45.584
What happened?

01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:48.084
Jim cheated on me.

01:31:49.334 --> 01:31:51.001
- Fucking hell.
- Mmm.

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:56.167
And I cheated on him.

01:32:08.959 --> 01:32:10.209
Do you want a drink?

01:32:10.334 --> 01:32:11.751
Mmm.

01:32:12.334 --> 01:32:13.251
Tea?

01:32:25.834 --> 01:32:27.001
I'll get her.

01:32:33.459 --> 01:32:35.917
Shh. Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

01:32:41.917 --> 01:32:45.667
Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:32:51.126 --> 01:32:53.626
Things are pretty fucked up,
Shirley.

01:33:41.459 --> 01:33:42.834
What are you gonna do?

01:33:42.876 --> 01:33:44.709
I don't know.

01:33:47.417 --> 01:33:49.042
Can I stay here tonight?

01:33:53.251 --> 01:33:55.709
Got anything going spare
in your property empire?

01:33:55.834 --> 01:33:58.834
It's a few flats.

01:34:01.167 --> 01:34:02.251
OK.

01:34:03.417 --> 01:34:05.084
Maybe I know of
something small.

01:34:06.042 --> 01:34:07.542
Small is good.

01:34:08.167 --> 01:34:09.459
Small is all I need.

01:34:10.126 --> 01:34:11.917
Shh, shh, shh.

01:34:15.751 --> 01:34:17.167
What's so funny?

01:34:17.917 --> 01:34:19.709
You can't just put a baby
on the floor

01:34:19.792 --> 01:34:21.542
when you're done with it,
Laura!

01:34:22.167 --> 01:34:23.542
Like a handbag!

01:34:24.167 --> 01:34:27.834
She's fine. People are
hysterical about babies.

01:34:55.042 --> 01:34:58.209
Let's go to the airport.
Let's go.

01:35:09.042 --> 01:35:10.959
Let's go!

01:35:46.459 --> 01:35:48.834
The dawn of your new decade.

01:35:52.917 --> 01:35:54.209
How are you feeling?

01:36:01.626 --> 01:36:03.542
I'm covered in fungus.

01:36:12.917 --> 01:36:14.626
Come on, piglet.

01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:15.751
I'll roast you a pizza.

01:36:18.292 --> 01:36:19.251
Arggh!

01:36:43.292 --> 01:36:44.542
Ooh.

01:36:50.501 --> 01:36:51.459
Thank you.

01:36:51.584 --> 01:36:54.376
So, today I've got a
solo date with him.

01:36:54.417 --> 01:36:56.001
But no,
they're supporting this.

01:36:56.126 --> 01:36:57.959
Like, they're actually
having him go on a date

01:36:58.084 --> 01:36:59.834
and then putting her,
to embarrass her, to be like,

01:36:59.959 --> 01:37:02.126
"No, women actually...
Lucky, poor them.

01:37:02.251 --> 01:37:03.667
"They're trying to find
partners.

01:37:03.792 --> 01:37:04.876
"Too bad they can't get any.

01:37:05.001 --> 01:37:06.292
"That's why they've got to go
on this date.

01:37:06.417 --> 01:37:08.584
"So sad. Poor her."

01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:10.501
Yeah, so,
obviously, all of us here...

01:37:12.292 --> 01:37:14.126
Look, you know,
I'm not happy for anyone

01:37:14.167 --> 01:37:16.209
who gets to go on a date
with Stacey.

01:37:16.334 --> 01:37:19.209
But if Rick does get a
one-on-one, I'd be very upset.

01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:21.251
I think this seriously would be

01:37:21.376 --> 01:37:23.209
an incredible place
to fall in love.

01:37:23.334 --> 01:37:26.292
Stacey's gonna spend
more time with one of us,

01:37:26.417 --> 01:37:28.376
and to be there
watching her enjoy a place

01:37:28.501 --> 01:37:30.042
that she's always
wanted to go.

01:37:30.167 --> 01:37:33.251
I can't wait to go on a date
with Stacey in Dublin.

01:37:55.001 --> 01:37:56.584
Sorry.

01:38:07.126 --> 01:38:10.667
How's that going down?

01:38:10.751 --> 01:38:13.501
Oh, it's disgusting.

01:38:20.334 --> 01:38:21.751
So, what do you think?

01:38:23.084 --> 01:38:25.709
I think vodka's our only option.

01:38:40.876 --> 01:38:42.376
Do you love me, Laura?

01:38:51.126 --> 01:38:52.417
Not enough.

01:39:20.501 --> 01:39:22.417
Put the fag out, Bogart.

01:39:22.834 --> 01:39:23.792
Or what?

01:39:25.584 --> 01:39:28.417
Or you will feel the wrath
of my jujitsu.

01:39:35.709 --> 01:39:38.334
Oof! I have got the major
fanny gallops.

01:39:39.334 --> 01:39:41.626
Fuck. I think
I just started my period.

01:39:41.751 --> 01:39:43.667
It might even be late.

01:39:44.667 --> 01:39:46.501
I don't know.
I sort of lost track.

01:39:46.626 --> 01:39:48.459
It's always a relief, isn't it?

01:39:53.626 --> 01:39:55.376
I feel weird.

01:39:56.334 --> 01:39:58.376
20 years and it still
surprises me every time.

01:39:59.084 --> 01:40:00.334
Like a season.

01:40:00.376 --> 01:40:03.626
Snoresville.
I got the decorators in too.

01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:06.042
Now, more importantly,
what are you gonna sing?

01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:07.417
You Oughta Know?

01:40:07.542 --> 01:40:09.876
Actually, T,
do you mind if we split?

01:40:10.459 --> 01:40:11.542
What?

01:40:12.084 --> 01:40:13.834
No. We only just got here.

01:40:14.542 --> 01:40:17.626
Come on. You're developing
a terrible habit of leaving.

01:40:30.251 --> 01:40:31.876
Are you alright
to just get a taxi?

01:40:34.209 --> 01:40:36.751
First up, we have Tyler
singing Royals.

01:40:36.792 --> 01:40:37.751
I'm up.

01:40:37.834 --> 01:40:39.376
Come on, stay for my song.

01:40:55.209 --> 01:40:57.334
♪ And we'll never be royals

01:40:57.459 --> 01:40:58.376

01:42:13.876 --> 01:42:15.042
I'm proud of you, sis.

01:42:15.667 --> 01:42:16.542
For what?

01:42:17.126 --> 01:42:18.876
For giving a beautiful speech.

01:42:19.292 --> 01:42:20.459
For being here.

01:42:30.042 --> 01:42:32.626
Bummed this off the barman.

01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:35.251
- One of THOSE non-smokers!
- Mmm.

01:42:36.751 --> 01:42:38.626
Give us a drag.

01:42:40.167 --> 01:42:42.334
Quick. Before he brings
Shirley out here.

01:42:51.292 --> 01:42:52.584
He looks sick.

01:42:54.626 --> 01:42:55.751
Yeah.

01:42:56.876 --> 01:42:57.834
He does.

01:43:26.917 --> 01:43:28.709
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:43:32.542 --> 01:43:33.917
Tell me about the
next time we met.

01:43:34.417 --> 01:43:35.542
You were driving a tram.

01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:37.334
It wasn't even my tram.

01:43:37.417 --> 01:43:39.209
It was the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

01:43:46.167 --> 01:43:47.459
Was any of it real?

01:43:50.417 --> 01:43:51.376
Mwah!

01:43:56.959 --> 01:43:58.376
All of it.

01:44:00.792 --> 01:44:02.376
Come on,
you're better than this.

01:44:03.292 --> 01:44:06.584
What it takes, my friend,
is inspiration.

01:44:09.834 --> 01:44:11.459
Did you mean that last night?

01:44:12.792 --> 01:44:13.959
Did you?

01:44:16.167 --> 01:44:17.292
Yeah.

01:44:18.001 --> 01:44:18.876
Yeah.

01:44:19.126 --> 01:44:22.084
You haven't thought about
the actual married bit

01:44:22.209 --> 01:44:23.376
of being married?
