WEBVTT

00:07.062 --> 00:10.509
You gentlemen wanna say anything
before we get started?

00:16.559 --> 00:17.850
Anyone?

00:23.190 --> 00:25.357
Okay.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.943
The matter at hand is the sale
of McCullough Oil.

00:29.822 --> 00:32.865
This here is the contract
Mr. Sweeney was kind enough

00:32.908 --> 00:36.493
to send over to my office,
unsolicited,

00:36.537 --> 00:38.537
oh so many weeks ago.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.460
Now, I've used this as the basis
for a counteroffer.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.295
There's no counter.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.547
Excuse me?

00:48.591 --> 00:50.674
That deal is
off the table.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.719
Here is
our latest offer.

00:53.763 --> 00:57.473
Listen to me,
you shit-grinning afterbirth.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.224
I came here
to treat with you,

00:59.268 --> 01:01.310
and you will hear
my conditions.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.229
I want a full half of everything
that comes out of the ground,

01:04.272 --> 01:06.857
every cent in oil,
every dollar in gas...

01:06.901 --> 01:10.277
Half of everything right down the
middle, before the taxman gets it.

01:10.321 --> 01:13.572
Also,
I want the photo negatives

01:13.616 --> 01:15.908
and any other dirt
you've collected on my boy.

01:19.205 --> 01:20.370
Continue.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.372
We keep my name.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.894
"McCullough" on the papers,
"McCullough" on the trucks,

01:23.918 --> 01:26.585
and I want my boy Pete here
front and center.

01:26.629 --> 01:29.505
This is a family business,
and I want this family

01:29.548 --> 01:33.550
at the center of whatever it is
you call this... partnership.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.260
Is that it?

01:35.304 --> 01:37.805
Yeah. That's it.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.350
No.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.851
Excuse me?

01:42.895 --> 01:45.896
That offer your lawyer
marked up

01:45.940 --> 01:50.400
was made to a man who had
things to offer in return,

01:50.444 --> 01:51.819
a man with a name,

01:51.862 --> 01:55.197
a man with resources
to build on.

01:55.241 --> 01:58.659
You got no money,
you got no friends,

01:58.702 --> 02:01.537
and all the ranchers
that used to kiss your ass

02:01.580 --> 02:03.497
have all
turned against you

02:03.541 --> 02:07.084
in favor of a bigger piece
of meat.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.211
And of course,
that sodomite son of yours

02:09.255 --> 02:12.422
is never gonna sit
on the Railroad Commission.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.676
You got Miss García to thank
for that last part, by the way.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.637
Perceptive woman.

02:18.681 --> 02:23.642
You shit-town Caesars
carry yourselves like royalty,

02:23.686 --> 02:24.977
but to me and my backers,

02:25.020 --> 02:27.688
you're nothing but
a collection of parts.

02:27.731 --> 02:31.567
When something breaks,
price goes down.

02:31.610 --> 02:35.320
You thought you was
fighting a war,

02:35.364 --> 02:37.865
but we was just
doing business.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.367
And I do it better
than you.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.414
So, you're gonna
take that deal

02:45.457 --> 02:49.334
because that deal's commensurate
with your current value,

02:49.378 --> 02:52.838
which is the value
of every other south Texas boob

02:52.882 --> 02:56.675
I've had to meet with in
this godforsaken little town.

02:56.719 --> 03:00.220
You get an eighth,
just like everyone else.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.810
You're gonna
sign my paper,

03:06.854 --> 03:08.896
and then you're gonna
shake my hand

03:08.939 --> 03:11.064
because that is how business
is done.

03:26.332 --> 03:27.456
Mm.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.793
Well-played, Mr. Monahan.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.462
Well-played.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.481
Daddy...

04:10.668 --> 04:12.334
Well?

04:12.378 --> 04:14.086
"Well" what?

04:14.129 --> 04:16.338
Well, what the hell
are you boys staring at?

04:19.468 --> 04:21.343
Somebody get a shovel.

05:01.592 --> 05:04.303
What the hell
were you thinking?

05:05.889 --> 05:08.056
I wasn't gonna let
that happen, OK?

05:08.100 --> 05:10.267
Exactly what
were you thinking?

05:10.311 --> 05:13.395
I wasn't thinking.
It just happened.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.397
You really gone
and done it this time, Eli.

05:15.441 --> 05:18.650
You really gone
and done it.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.570
Eh, you're both right
in thinking that I lost it.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.822
Hmm.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.575
Well, you can
gloat on it tomorrow.

05:26.618 --> 05:27.909
Tonight,
we clean up this mess.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.578
Pete, head home.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.663
Grab the quicklime
and the shovels.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.685
There's a tarp in the truck.
You got a mop and a bucket?

05:33.709 --> 05:35.167
I do.
Show it to me.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.669
When you're done, Finn,
fetch the Sheriff.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.421
I'll deal with the bodies.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.675
All right.
You two, get to it.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.094
Charles, c'mon.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.679
I wanna stay
with the Colonel.

05:47.723 --> 05:50.390
- You're coming with me.
- Pete. Pete...

05:50.434 --> 05:52.726
We can use
the boy's hands.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.730
Do what you want.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.705
It used to be, you had
a problem with a man,

06:55.749 --> 06:59.626
you settled it
and you left him there.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.920
Wasn't no reason
to clean up.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.131
Soldiers don't need
to hide.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.966
Hiding things
is for slaves.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.013
When you were at war
and the enemy fell,

07:12.057 --> 07:16.393
you just moved on and let
the body go the way of nature.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.900
Animals always eat
the soft parts of a man first...

07:23.944 --> 07:27.320
Eyes, nose, cheeks.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.411
Ooh-whee!

07:34.455 --> 07:36.955
Oh. It's just you,
Sheriff.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.999
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.709
I told you it was bad.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.671
This is more than bad.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.257
Christ.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.135
I'm gonna need your help,
Moses.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.345
I ain't getting paid enough
for this.

07:54.308 --> 07:57.517
My piece of the pie
just got a whole lot bigger.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.479
Done.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.856
I just need to make sure
you're all in.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.483
Why is that, Colonel?

08:04.526 --> 08:06.443
We got one more stop
after this.

08:13.619 --> 08:16.578
You're a good man.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.526
Shut. Up.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.529
I'm just
passin' the time.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.198
It's bad enough
I have to look at you.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.867
I don't want to
hear you.

08:55.911 --> 08:59.871
Well, we're both working
for Roy Endicott,

08:59.915 --> 09:01.873
so we're on
the same side now.

09:01.917 --> 09:05.502
Just... stop.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.797
Pbht!

09:10.884 --> 09:12.842
Ugh.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.430
Ingrate!

09:45.335 --> 09:47.419
Hold it right there.
Put the gun down.

09:47.462 --> 09:50.046
I will not. You gotta get
her out of here, Niles.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.299
I'm not kidding around.
Buddy Monahan is dead.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.759
Why don't you go pull on
the other one, Pete?

09:54.803 --> 09:56.511
No games.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.741
Monahan, the two hired guns,
and the barrister... all dead.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.807
She's next, I think.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.225
You ain't sure?

10:02.269 --> 10:05.145
You wanna stay
and find out?

10:10.402 --> 10:14.613
There's a little shack
at the crossing at Blackridge.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.783
I'll meet you
as soon as I can.

10:23.332 --> 10:26.249
Peter.
What's happening?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.460
Go with Niles and wait.
He'll keep you safe.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.023
I'll come and meet you
as soon as I can.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.213
- Why?
- My father's coming for you.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.465
You need to leave
right now.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.258
Don't ask questions.
Just trust me.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.677
Our people are going to want
to know who did this.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.056
Are you gong to tell them?

12:05.100 --> 12:07.559
His widow would give you
a very slow death, I think.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.908
Army soldiers.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.607
Don't.
It itches.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.193
I don't care.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.820
Not gonna let you
smear the edges.

13:43.198 --> 13:47.325
I have to go.
You know I have to.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.701
The men have decided.

13:48.745 --> 13:49.953
The men have been
lied to.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.624
Isn't this
what you wanted?

13:54.668 --> 13:56.501
Didn't you say we should
all band together

13:56.545 --> 13:57.961
and kill all the whites?

13:58.004 --> 14:01.005
No, this is wrong.
The time is wrong.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.593
What do you want me
to do?

14:05.637 --> 14:08.805
I want you to not die.

14:11.059 --> 14:14.018
Hey.
I want that, too.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.102
Do you think I'm stupid?

14:56.146 --> 14:57.729
No.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.063
Why do you lie to me?

14:59.107 --> 15:01.816
I didn't.
I d-don't lie.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.484
I should hold your head
under the water

15:03.528 --> 15:04.986
till that paint
washes off.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.490
You know, Fat Wolf
had one thing right...

15:09.534 --> 15:11.200
This stinks
of white people.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.704
He just got
the wrong white people.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.873
Soldiers don't need
to hide things.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.833
Slaves do.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.634
Scalped-A-Dog
attacked Ingrid.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.885
She killed him.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.473
Then what?

15:35.060 --> 15:37.018
Then I helped her
bury him.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.831
If a spider asks for help
eating your children,

15:38.855 --> 15:40.146
do you say yes?

15:40.190 --> 15:41.981
I owe her.
She's a slave because of me.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.692
No, she's a slave because
her people came onto this land,

15:44.736 --> 15:46.653
called it their own.

15:46.696 --> 15:47.820
But you're worse.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.074
What do you mean?

15:51.117 --> 15:53.826
She's not Numunuu.
You are.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.079
You know better.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.039
But you hide things
from me.

15:58.083 --> 16:01.167
You lie to your people.

16:01.211 --> 16:04.796
People will die because of
what you have done!

16:04.839 --> 16:07.382
You can tell them.
I won't say you're wrong.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.676
If I say something,
they'll cut your eyes out

16:09.719 --> 16:12.971
and Fat Wolf will find another
reason to get us killed.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.644
How is it that I have
ruined all my sons?

16:19.688 --> 16:20.895
Toshaway.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.559
Nothing is moving.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.020
Everything's asleep,
Tiehteti.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.767
Fire at will!

19:25.206 --> 19:26.831
Eli.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.132
It was a trap.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.976
I'm sorry.

19:56.404 --> 19:57.653
For what?

20:52.168 --> 20:55.253
White people
and their guns.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.210
The white slave killed
Scalped-A-Dog,

22:18.254 --> 22:20.004
and I think you knew it.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.339
Mm?

23:18.981 --> 23:21.273
Eli, I need to
ask you something.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.526
Not now.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.611
Fat Wolf wants me,
Eli.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.699
Please, let me go
with the Yaparuka.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.618
Let me be someone else's
problem.

23:32.662 --> 23:35.246
No.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.749
I just want to go somewhere
where no one hates me.

23:38.793 --> 23:42.503
I said no.
You brought death and pain.

23:42.547 --> 23:44.130
You're gonna die with us.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.390
It's her decision.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.529
Did you tell her
I would give her 10 horses?

24:08.573 --> 24:11.240
Th-That's a great price.

24:11.284 --> 24:14.076
She wants me to suffer.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.996
She's stupid.

24:17.039 --> 24:21.250
Where will you go?
North?

24:21.294 --> 24:23.502
They don't
tell me anything.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.673
My people
have already left.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.428
Go on.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.138
They need you.

24:43.816 --> 24:48.027
You know my hands shake
when I'm alone.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.696
I don't like to eat.

24:50.740 --> 24:54.575
I can't remember the last time
I slept through the night.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.245
You made me feel safe.

25:00.666 --> 25:04.168
The first thing in a long time
that's made me feel that way.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.112
Goodbye.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.845
Took you long enough.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.975
Bodies ready to load?

26:43.019 --> 26:45.060
Yeah.
Just inside the door.

26:56.991 --> 27:01.327
Pete, Finn,
put the bodies in the ground.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.955
Charles and Dart,
stay with me and finish up.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.874
Finish up what?

27:06.917 --> 27:08.709
Gotta go over
everything twice.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.336
You need the Sheriff
for that?

27:10.379 --> 27:12.796
I need all the hands
we can spare.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.007
Then why don't I stay?

27:15.051 --> 27:19.637
I don't think you have the
stomach for this kind of work.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.014
I've been doing your dirty work
for a long time now.

27:22.058 --> 27:25.142
I need you
to understand me.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.019
You don't wanna be here
for what comes next.

27:27.063 --> 27:28.854
Pete,
let's hit the road.

27:28.898 --> 27:31.106
What are you gonna do,
Daddy?

27:31.150 --> 27:33.378
You gonna get on your hands
and knees and clean the floor?

27:33.402 --> 27:35.903
No, sir, I will not.
No, sir, no.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.799
This cleanup's gonna require
more blood, ain't it?

27:37.823 --> 27:39.406
Pete.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.325
Who is it, Daddy?

27:41.369 --> 27:43.118
Who else has got to die?

27:45.498 --> 27:47.289
Come on.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.957
Say her name.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.209
Say it.

27:50.252 --> 27:53.379
She's a human being.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.089
Say it.

27:55.132 --> 27:57.841
Don't do this.

27:57.885 --> 28:00.386
I didn't think you could
stoop this low...

28:00.429 --> 28:03.222
All the way
to the bottom.

28:03.265 --> 28:05.077
Don't you know what this will do
to our family?

28:05.101 --> 28:08.018
It will save us!

28:08.062 --> 28:10.229
Maria García dies
and this is over.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.563
Don't you want this over?!

28:11.607 --> 28:14.400
Don't you want
your children safe?

28:14.443 --> 28:16.235
That's what I want
more than anything else...

28:16.278 --> 28:18.320
Anything...
To keep you safe.

28:18.364 --> 28:22.324
You made me a promise in Mexico
you'd be here 100%.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.118
So are you here?
Hmm?

28:24.161 --> 28:25.411
Are you here?

29:21.385 --> 29:23.427
Ms. García?

29:23.471 --> 29:25.095
Ms. García,
this is Sheriff Dart.

29:25.139 --> 29:26.972
I need to speak with you,
ma'am.

29:29.018 --> 29:30.976
Ms. García, open the door.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.436
Come on, Sheriff.
Come on, come on.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.277
Well, where the hell
is she?

30:10.267 --> 30:12.351
He can't do this.

30:12.394 --> 30:15.229
Settle down, brother.

30:15.272 --> 30:18.607
I think he meant to kill
those folks tonight.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.317
I think he acted
like he was gonna...

30:20.361 --> 30:22.444
Gonna make peace
just to get us in that room.

30:25.241 --> 30:30.118
I don't believe that.
Think happened how he said.

30:30.162 --> 30:34.289
He got angry,
lost his head.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.625
He went into that meetin'
cross-strapped!

30:39.171 --> 30:41.547
He had it in his head all along
to go after Maria!

30:48.764 --> 30:51.014
This hole
ain't gonna dig itself.

30:51.058 --> 30:52.058
C'mon.

31:36.186 --> 31:37.561
Mama?

31:40.482 --> 31:44.443
Sorry, baby.
Um...

31:44.486 --> 31:46.904
I was trying
to stay quiet.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.991
What's the rifle for?

31:51.035 --> 31:53.201
I had a bad dream.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.286
What about?

31:56.832 --> 31:58.874
It's nothing, baby.
Why don't you go back to bed?

32:01.587 --> 32:04.004
Where's Daddy?

32:04.048 --> 32:05.631
I don't know.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.549
Well...

32:07.593 --> 32:10.636
is he with Granddaddy?

32:10.679 --> 32:12.804
I don't know.

32:12.848 --> 32:15.682
- Why'd they bring Charles along?
- Honey, I don't know.

32:15.726 --> 32:17.537
- Then what do you know?
- Nothing, Jeanne Anne.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.227
Nothing.
They don't tell me shit.

32:24.151 --> 32:25.795
This is what it's like
being in this family.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.445
It's just waiting up all night
and being told nothing

32:28.489 --> 32:30.155
and having to take
what they give you...

32:30.199 --> 32:31.907
What little they decide
to give you.

32:49.051 --> 32:51.093
That's what it's like for me,
anyway.

32:55.391 --> 32:58.725
I'm sorry, Mama.

32:58.769 --> 33:02.396
Don't be.

33:02.439 --> 33:05.107
Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.444
All right?
Nobody's gonna come.

33:12.658 --> 33:18.036
I did not want this for you,
baby.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.705
I wanted better.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.565
Charles.

33:46.608 --> 33:47.608
Let me have the rifle.

33:50.404 --> 33:53.822
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
That shirt needs to be burned.

33:53.866 --> 33:54.906
Give it here.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.701
Who's there?

34:45.833 --> 34:47.292
Charles.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.127
Honey,
where is everybody?

34:52.800 --> 34:55.175
Is that blood?

34:55.219 --> 34:57.803
- Mom, Mom.
- Honey.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.805
Leave it alone.

35:08.190 --> 35:09.731
Charles.

35:24.957 --> 35:26.957
Aah.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.333
Damn bastard.

35:32.089 --> 35:33.296
Did you sleep?

35:33.340 --> 35:35.632
No.

35:35.676 --> 35:37.300
This cabin
is disgusting.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.177
Yeah.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.597
Well, it's better
than a hole in the ground.

35:42.641 --> 35:46.017
But Her Majesty
is welcome to switch.

35:46.061 --> 35:48.687
Is that coffee?

35:48.730 --> 35:49.730
Sort of.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.948
You think Pete's right?

36:02.661 --> 36:04.786
You think Eli's
coming for me?

36:11.837 --> 36:13.795
I do.

36:17.968 --> 36:20.468
Did you know
the Battle of Princeton

36:20.512 --> 36:23.054
was one of the most important
of Washington's victories

36:23.098 --> 36:25.223
in the Revolutionary War?

36:25.267 --> 36:27.058
One of Washington's spies

36:27.102 --> 36:28.371
- was a student at the university.
- Can I see?

36:28.395 --> 36:29.936
Hey!
Hmm.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.271
Jeanne Anne.

36:31.315 --> 36:32.439
Sorry.
Thought I saw a mouse.

36:32.482 --> 36:34.983
She's incorrigible.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.151
Go fetch
your brother's book.

36:50.042 --> 36:52.292
Hi.
God.

36:52.336 --> 36:54.044
Late-night poker game
over at Pink's.

36:54.087 --> 36:55.962
Oh.

36:56.006 --> 36:58.206
Tell you what, them aces
just kept jumping into my hand.

36:59.927 --> 37:05.222
Breakfast smells great.
Two more plates, por favor!

37:05.265 --> 37:07.307
Hey, Pete,
you as hungry as I am?

37:11.897 --> 37:12.938
No.

37:59.987 --> 38:01.236
Did you do it?

38:07.119 --> 38:12.747
By the time we got to her place,
she was already gone.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.041
Seems to have left
in a hurry.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.672
Oh.

38:23.218 --> 38:27.929
I understand
you're pleased.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.347
It's all right.

38:32.352 --> 38:36.855
There was no sign
of Niles Gilbert, either.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.523
You know anything
about that?

38:46.325 --> 38:47.949
Are you kidding me?

38:50.329 --> 38:54.539
If she's alive, yeah,
I-I'm happy about that.

38:54.583 --> 38:58.293
But don't you ever question
my commitment to this family.

38:58.337 --> 39:01.379
I made you a promise,
and I've honored it.

39:01.423 --> 39:03.923
I shot that man.

39:03.967 --> 39:05.592
I-I buried those bodies.

39:05.635 --> 39:08.887
I was ready to let Maria die
for you.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.514
That's what you wanted.
That's what you got.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.525
I'm gonna go wash up.

39:22.569 --> 39:26.863
Then I'm gonna ride the fences,
if that's all right with you.

39:26.907 --> 39:28.990
Of course.

39:32.371 --> 39:36.039
I'm sorry.

39:36.083 --> 39:39.626
I know I've asked
a lot of you.

39:39.669 --> 39:42.170
I appreciate
everything you do.

39:58.230 --> 40:01.106
I bought this little
parcel a couple of months ago,

40:01.149 --> 40:04.943
before the Colonel
tossed me out on my ear.

40:04.986 --> 40:08.029
It's a good spot
for a little farm.

40:17.499 --> 40:19.207
I got a woman coming.

40:22.254 --> 40:24.045
Emma Calhoun.

40:26.258 --> 40:28.508
Good woman.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.301
Fine family.

40:32.389 --> 40:33.805
Educated.

40:37.519 --> 40:38.893
Listen to this.

40:43.358 --> 40:47.569
"I am not a woman
who babbles like a brook"

40:47.612 --> 40:51.239
or sits on a shelf

40:51.283 --> 40:57.412
or drapes herself on a divan
like an ancient piece of lace.

40:57.456 --> 41:01.666
If that is what you want,
then stop your letters.

41:01.710 --> 41:07.589
But if you want a strong hand,
a bright mind,

41:07.632 --> 41:13.928
and an unrestrained tongue
to guide you,

41:13.972 --> 41:17.182
"then I am
what you seek."

41:24.524 --> 41:26.524
Well, I mean shit,
right?

41:29.029 --> 41:31.321
You don't deserve her.
Right.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.115
Who goes there?

41:38.413 --> 41:42.290
Boy... you look like
hammered dog shit.

41:42.334 --> 41:43.291
Put the gun down.

41:43.335 --> 41:45.335
Not yet.

41:45.378 --> 41:48.630
I'm thankful
for last night's tip, Pete,

41:48.673 --> 41:52.342
but today is a new day,

41:52.385 --> 41:54.969
and you've been known
to blow with the wind.

41:57.057 --> 41:58.765
Now, are you gonna draw
on your daddy

41:58.808 --> 42:01.309
when he comes down
that road?

42:01.353 --> 42:03.311
Will you do
what has to be done?

42:13.532 --> 42:15.156
Answer the question.
