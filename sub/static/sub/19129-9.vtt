WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:03.137
Previously on "The Path"...

00:03.171 --> 00:04.471
- What if we're wrong about

00:04.505 --> 00:06.474
our exemption application
being recalled?

00:06.507 --> 00:08.442
- We don't have any money, Cal.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.644
- Please, take a seat.
- Who the hell is that?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.113
- That's Sarah Lane.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.447
And that is why the exemption

00:13.481 --> 00:16.117
is so very important
to us, Lisa...

00:16.149 --> 00:19.820
'cause what you did
will never, ever go away.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.298
- I need you to get
in the car, sweetheart.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.724
- Sean, listen to your mother.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.060
- Sean, my name
is Wendy Kennair.

00:26.094 --> 00:29.397
- She's gonna help you, Sean...
- You, Mary, and our grandchild.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.764
You're getting out.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.165
- Jacqueline Richards?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.202
You contributed on behalf

00:34.235 --> 00:36.370
of your daughter, Noa,
to our cause.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.173
- I'm a friend of your son's.
- My son?

00:39.207 --> 00:40.641
- I'm afraid he's out of town.

00:40.674 --> 00:45.146
- Your doctor, Steven Meyer...
- He hurt him.

00:45.179 --> 00:48.449
- I picked a son,
but he was the wrong son.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.818
- You will build The Garden,

00:50.851 --> 00:53.421
and we will follow you there.

01:32.493 --> 01:36.764
Sometimes I was with
both of them on the same night.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.233
Some nights, I would have dinner
with Katie and the kids

01:39.267 --> 01:41.169
and then make up some excuse,

01:41.202 --> 01:43.337
like leaving
for a business trip,

01:43.371 --> 01:46.174
and then go back to Tracy
for the rest of the week.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.611
*

01:50.644 --> 01:52.313
Why are you doing this?

01:52.346 --> 01:56.684
*

01:56.717 --> 01:58.519
It's something I'm dealing with.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.753
It's my life.

01:59.787 --> 02:03.157
- Your lives, plural, Don.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.758
- Fuck you.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.628
You came to us
drowning in guilt,

02:07.661 --> 02:10.464
overwhelmed, and talking
about taking your own life.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.300
We helped you.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.235
We asked you to search
within yourself

02:14.268 --> 02:17.638
to figure out why you were
doing what you were doing

02:17.671 --> 02:21.509
and why you started
two separate families

02:21.542 --> 02:23.377
both built on lies;

02:23.411 --> 02:26.347
to ask yourself why
you felt so compelled

02:26.380 --> 02:28.749
to deceive so many people.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.784
And we talked you
off the ledge of suicide,

02:30.818 --> 02:35.356
but you weren't willing
to uncover the mystery of you.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.301
We talked to you, but you didn't
want to do any real work,

02:37.325 --> 02:40.628
and now you've made
a very successful life

02:40.661 --> 02:43.731
built on Transgressions.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.634
And it's all very delicate.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.204
Your fragile house of lies...

02:50.238 --> 02:52.606
It could collapse at any moment.

02:52.640 --> 02:59.613
*

02:59.647 --> 03:01.549
- Sorry for the delay.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.816
- No problem.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.686
*

03:05.719 --> 03:06.887
- I'll get you a receipt.

03:06.920 --> 03:13.861
*

03:29.710 --> 03:36.650
*

03:56.670 --> 03:59.507
- You look like you want someone
to come over and talk to you.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.545
I'm Father Cates.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.315
- You know, I used to come
to this church when I was a kid.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.016
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.851
- Welcome back, then.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.621
Ah, 20 years, so...

04:13.654 --> 04:15.856
Father Deans.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.958
- Yeah.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.660
Wow, Father Deans.

04:19.692 --> 04:24.332
Jesus, I never would've
remembered that name.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.999
You weren't here then, were you?

04:26.033 --> 04:29.437
- No, I was still a kid
in Washington State,

04:29.470 --> 04:32.039
thinking I wanted to be
a doctor like my dad.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.742
- How did you decide
to join the church?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.745
- Are you considering
entering the priesthood?

04:37.778 --> 04:40.381
- No, no, I was just, uh...

04:40.414 --> 04:43.484
just curious.

04:43.517 --> 04:47.488
I mean, did something happen
that made you sure

04:47.521 --> 04:50.524
that you were supposed
to work for Him?

04:52.360 --> 04:54.895
- Uh, no is the short answer.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.632
Would it be helpful
to tell me what it is

04:58.666 --> 05:00.701
you're deciding to do
or not to do?

05:05.539 --> 05:09.577
Ah, I guess
you could say that...

05:09.610 --> 05:11.679
I'm hearing a call.

05:11.712 --> 05:16.884
- Well, listening
can be terrifying.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.687
But the thought of not listening
can be even worse.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.889
- I don't know.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.425
Just feels like a crapshoot
either way.

05:24.458 --> 05:28.128
- Well, certainty that
this is my life's work

05:28.161 --> 05:31.832
is tested every day.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.734
But if it's a mistake,

05:33.767 --> 05:34.935
I'd make it again.

05:42.142 --> 05:45.746
Faith is inspiring
divisiveness, destruction,

05:45.779 --> 05:47.415
hate, and greed.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.049
And the tragic irony
is that faith

05:49.082 --> 05:53.387
is meant to inspire compassion
and empathy and love.

05:53.421 --> 05:56.790
- And would this Dr. Meyer
himself be speaking,

05:56.824 --> 05:58.426
were we to find room
in the schedule?

05:58.459 --> 06:00.728
- No, uh, my colleague and I

06:00.761 --> 06:02.963
speak on behalf
of the Movement now.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.499
But we are deeply interested
in participating

06:05.533 --> 06:06.700
in your conference.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.703
We... we have much to contribute

06:09.737 --> 06:11.872
and much to learn, as well.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.550
They must have squeezed
some of their donors.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.875
No shit.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.610
And just like that,
any leverage we had

06:16.644 --> 06:18.946
with them up to their ass
in back taxes is gone.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.181
And you had no idea they were
coming up with a plan

06:21.214 --> 06:22.583
to wiggle out of the noose.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.017
You're inside,

06:24.051 --> 06:26.520
and yet we learn about this
before you do.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.656
Do you even recognize
any of these people

06:28.689 --> 06:32.860
who coughed up cash
to pay off their IRS debt?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.995
Don Hendren, Martina Bill,

06:35.028 --> 06:36.630
Pete Gilchrist...

06:36.664 --> 06:40.434
All of these people are level 3R
at the highest.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.045
They're practicing Meyerists,
but they...

06:42.069 --> 06:43.904
They're not living it full-time.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.083
- Just figure out
what the hell is going on

06:47.107 --> 06:49.209
and how we can use it.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.445
- Listen, I-I don't know
how this happened,

06:51.479 --> 06:53.146
but I will figure out
what's going on.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.088
Damn it!

07:07.495 --> 07:14.434
*

07:23.043 --> 07:29.983
*

07:33.286 --> 07:34.788
Felicia, what are you...

07:34.822 --> 07:36.990
- Richard told me everything.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.726
But I need to hear it from you.

07:38.759 --> 07:45.699
*

07:55.075 --> 07:58.011
I just can't keep
running from this.

07:58.045 --> 08:01.549
- He bears its mark on his back.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.983
- Or it's just a wound...

08:03.016 --> 08:04.217
A wound from the lightning.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.886
- Well...

08:05.919 --> 08:09.156
- He's meant to lead us,
Felicia.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.658
I'm convinced.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.192
- Well, that must be nice.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.727
I-I'm sorry.

08:13.761 --> 08:16.029
This is difficult to process.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.065
Three days ago, I had
every reason to believe

08:18.098 --> 08:20.668
that Steve had fulfilled
his work for us.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.736
Now I have to accept
this new story

08:22.770 --> 08:23.971
that you're meant to guide us.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.839
I get it.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.608
Certainty is a white whale.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.179
- There's only one way to know.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.153
Climb.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.823
You need to continue
the climb, 8R.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.161
*

08:51.098 --> 08:52.633
Excuse me, sir?

08:52.666 --> 08:54.234
- What?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.769
- We're here.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.323
This is the address
you gave me, right?

09:13.086 --> 09:17.791
*

09:17.825 --> 09:19.292
- Have you read it?

09:19.326 --> 09:21.361
- Uh, no, but I saw the movie.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.997
- It's black and white, right?
- Yes.

09:24.031 --> 09:28.001
Well, Kansas is black and white,
but Oz is in color.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.771
The land of Oz
is entirely green,

09:30.804 --> 09:34.207
but the inhabitants are wearing
these green-colored glasses,

09:34.241 --> 09:37.945
and they don't know that
their world is the same colors

09:37.978 --> 09:40.247
as everyone else's.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.750
Their "leader" is called
the Wizard of Oz,

09:42.783 --> 09:46.019
but really, he's just
a regular guy from Kansas

09:46.053 --> 09:50.223
that has everyone fooled.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.694
- Thanks for letting us
throw you a baby shower.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.096
- Uh, how do you two
know each other again?

09:56.129 --> 09:57.631
- Oh...
- College.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.132
- We're old friends.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.001
I hope you enjoy the book.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.970
I'll be curious
what you see in it,

10:03.003 --> 10:04.404
living how you...

10:04.437 --> 10:06.373
Well, where you do.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.142
They don't tell you what you
can and can't read, do they?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.811
- Can we be done, please?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.980
I'm tired, and this food
is terrible.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.417
- I'm ready to, uh, move ahead

10:17.450 --> 10:19.753
with the sale of the center in...
In New York...

10:19.787 --> 10:21.722
- I have news.
- Humble myself to the Council.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.891
And if they feel they need me
to step aside...

10:23.924 --> 10:25.258
- Cal...
- No, no.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.294
That is the best course
of action right now.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.896
- It's over.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.230
I made a few phone calls,

10:30.263 --> 10:32.199
and a few donors stepped up.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.433
- What?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.669
- I paid the back taxes
on this place.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.441
- I-I...

10:41.474 --> 10:43.744
How... how did you get
donors to do that?

10:43.777 --> 10:45.879
- I didn't sugarcoat.

10:45.913 --> 10:49.182
I let them know how dire
the situation was.

10:49.216 --> 10:52.185
It's a Band-Aid,
but it buys us some time.

10:52.219 --> 10:55.388
Cal?

10:55.422 --> 10:58.025
- No, no, um...

10:58.058 --> 11:01.128
uh, I just, um...

11:01.161 --> 11:03.030
Everything's gonna be okay?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.477
- I mean, we're far
from being in the clear.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.339
We still need to put other
sources of revenue in motion.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.141
- Yeah, of course, yeah.

11:14.174 --> 11:18.145
- And there's the World Faith
Conference in Boston.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.747
Very mainstream.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.883
Deepak Chopra, Tony Robbins...

11:22.916 --> 11:24.952
and we'll be speaking.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.186
- That's exciting.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.188
- I got us on the schedule.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.123
Main stage, second day.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.959
- Wow, you...

11:31.992 --> 11:34.795
Wow, that's great, Sarah.

11:34.828 --> 11:38.265
- This could be the beginning
of something new for us,

11:38.298 --> 11:41.068
you know, a way to...

11:41.101 --> 11:44.337
monetize our message.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.340
Open it up to corporate events.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.343
You know, uh,
executive training, you know.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.245
- Yeah.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.947
- We can do this.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.883
- Yeah, absolutely.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.886
- You know, we have
to face reality, right?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.420
We've certainly had a...

12:00.453 --> 12:02.355
A good dose of that recently.

12:02.389 --> 12:06.059
You're gonna be great
with this audience.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.395
- We'll be great.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.166
Uh, so, I, uh...
I'll just, uh...

12:13.200 --> 12:14.802
I'll just settle back in,

12:14.835 --> 12:17.971
and I'll catch up
with you later.

12:18.005 --> 12:21.041
- Is there anything that you
want to talk to me about?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.190
- All... all the...
- These donations, they were...

12:27.214 --> 12:28.515
They were voluntary, right?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.921
- Of course.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.355
- Yeah.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.395
*

12:57.010 --> 12:59.412
- Hey.
- Did you hear?

12:59.446 --> 13:01.849
The IRS stuff...

13:01.882 --> 13:03.350
It's over.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.961
- I heard Cal might've
had to go to jail.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.353
Is that true?

13:06.386 --> 13:08.155
- I don't...
- Don't think so.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.323
Who said that?

13:10.357 --> 13:12.259
Please.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.861
Stop.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.063
- You're out of shape.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.898
- Chasing after you
is exhausting.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.033
I like it, though.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.373
I'm sorry that I-I was a...

13:26.406 --> 13:28.375
- Dick?
- Dick.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.343
I am.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.511
- It's all right.

13:31.544 --> 13:35.582
- I was wondering if you...

13:35.615 --> 13:38.218
if you want to come
to dinner with me.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.589
- Yeah, fine.
- Where you thinking?

13:42.622 --> 13:44.224
- My mom's?

13:44.257 --> 13:45.935
- You're really doing
the "bring the girl home"

13:45.959 --> 13:47.036
"to meet the family" thing?

13:47.060 --> 13:48.228
- Yeah, yeah.
- I am, yeah.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.338
- Why?
- I've met your family.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.431
- I know. I-I just...

13:51.464 --> 13:54.301
I want you with me
when I go home.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.538
- You're so "aww, shucks,"
it's incredible.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.514
Yeah, I'll go.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.194
This is a token
of our appreciation

14:21.228 --> 14:23.330
for your incredibly
generous donation.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.998
The Movement thanks you.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.636
Uh, you are an inspiration.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.072
Honestly, thank you.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.908
- What do you want?

14:34.942 --> 14:36.509
I've done enough.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.579
My family is in there.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.448
- They blackmailed you too,
didn't they?

14:44.484 --> 14:47.520
*

14:47.554 --> 14:49.990
- They played you
your unburdening sessions?

14:50.023 --> 14:56.964
*

15:06.206 --> 15:07.374
- Welcome.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.142
- Thanks so much for having me.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.287
- Oh, I'm just so happy
that Hawk wanted to bring you.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.513
- She's a good one, this one.
- I know she is.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.182
- Hawk's back.
- Hey, kid.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.649
I missed you.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.418
Hey, I got someone
I want you to meet.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.154
- Noa, this is my sister Summer.
- Nice to meet you.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.690
Are you Hawk's girlfriend?

15:23.723 --> 15:25.525
You've got something
on your face.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.460
What you got on your face?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.429
No, on your face.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.564
You are Light in your world

15:31.598 --> 15:34.234
because you are your world.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.536
You are capable.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.606
You are...

15:42.675 --> 15:46.079
- Sorry, hon, I should have
turned it off.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.347
- Uh, where was I?

15:47.380 --> 15:49.382
- Uh, "You are capable
of summiting"

15:49.416 --> 15:51.018
the mountain of your spirit."

15:51.051 --> 15:53.386
- Okay, um, you guys
don't have to do this.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.654
I can get Cal to run it...

15:54.687 --> 15:56.689
- Just relax.
- Remember your breath.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.591
- I want to summit the mountain
of my spirit.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.393
You don't have to do this, Mom.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.628
You saved the city center.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.063
You don't...

16:03.096 --> 16:04.697
have to go pump up
a bunch of CEOs.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.566
- Well, it's not just
a bunch of CEOs, Hawk.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.235
- Look, I'm just saying,

16:08.268 --> 16:10.370
we can focus
on the real work now...

16:10.403 --> 16:12.439
The important work we're doing.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.574
- Hawk's right
about one thing, though,

16:14.607 --> 16:16.676
and we should take
a moment to, uh,

16:16.709 --> 16:18.345
acknowledge it.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.280
Sarah saved our asses.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.049
And I-I got to say,

16:22.082 --> 16:23.483
I was pretty nervous there.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.285
- Yeah, he couldn't sleep.
- No.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.096
- I'd come downstairs;
you'd just be sitting there.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.255
No, I honestly thought

16:28.288 --> 16:29.465
it all might be
coming to an end.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.591
- They're heartless gangsters.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.294
- We're just happy
that some people stepped up.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.728
- You got them to do that.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.231
You dragged us back
from the brink.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.432
We're lucky to have you.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.800
And not just the family...

16:40.833 --> 16:42.235
The entire Movement.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.603
- Although we really should be

16:43.636 --> 16:45.148
thanking the people
who wrote the checks.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.240
- All right, Nicole, just...

16:47.274 --> 16:49.709
- Nicole is right, Russel.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.611
- Thank you.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.780
I don't know; maybe that was
wrong of me to say,

16:53.813 --> 16:56.649
but I feel like you're
awfully critical of me lately.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.793
- What are you talking about?

16:57.817 --> 16:59.452
- I don't have a family.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.088
- I gave mine up.
- They gave you up.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.231
- We're your family, Nicole.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.490
- They did. They gave me up.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.691
- We love you like our own.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.727
- Nicole is absolutely right.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.531
The people who wrote the checks
made the real sacrifice.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.233
- But you worked for it.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.502
- Sorry you have
to watch us like this.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.703
Not fun, I know.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.471
- You kidding?

17:18.505 --> 17:20.440
I'm always impressed
when I see a family

17:20.473 --> 17:22.275
actually say anything
to each other.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.411
My family doesn't ever talk.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.347
We just hate each other
silently.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.149
- You should take
the compliment, Mom.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.283
You deserve it.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.154
I'll be right back.

17:37.190 --> 17:44.131
*

18:08.821 --> 18:15.762
*

18:25.605 --> 18:28.508
- I'm going to Boston...

18:28.541 --> 18:31.778
Going to, uh, speak
at a conference there.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.685
My mother died.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.720
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.694
It's just over, then, huh?

18:47.727 --> 18:50.730
Once they go, that's...
That's it.

18:50.763 --> 18:51.763
Done.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.804
- Have you read
"The Wizard of Oz"?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.643
- Um, I watched the movie.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.213
- Mothers are like Oz.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.481
Everyone expects them
to be able to give you

19:08.515 --> 19:10.717
a home, a heart, and a brain,

19:10.750 --> 19:14.621
but mostly they're just
fucked-up people.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.794
Why are you reading
"The Wizard of Oz"?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.430
- Why are you here?

19:26.599 --> 19:32.472
*

19:32.505 --> 19:35.208
I'm a husk, Mary.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.414
I want to be vapor.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.620
I want to metamorphose.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.426
We could do it together.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.595
You know...

19:55.628 --> 19:58.365
Swim in the sea.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.800
What do you say?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.269
- He's kicking.

20:04.371 --> 20:07.607
- Oh, holy shit, he really is.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.975
Does he do that all the time?

20:09.008 --> 20:10.377
- Yeah.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.550
You're tired.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.554
- Yeah.

20:24.457 --> 20:27.594
- So am I.

20:27.627 --> 20:34.567
*

20:45.778 --> 20:47.547
- The Eighth Rung of The Ladder

20:47.580 --> 20:50.617
is devoted to the pursuit
of mending.

20:52.852 --> 20:56.489
There's a tapestry that is
our collective existence,

20:56.523 --> 20:57.757
and it's frayed.

20:57.790 --> 20:58.925
Find a tear,

20:58.958 --> 21:01.461
and think about ways
to sew it up.

21:04.497 --> 21:11.438
*

21:22.782 --> 21:25.852
- Has the 27 bus come yet?

21:25.885 --> 21:27.387
- You know, I-I don't know.

21:27.420 --> 21:30.490
I'm just... just sitting here.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.725
Not waiting for a bus or...

21:32.759 --> 21:34.761
anything, specifically.

21:34.794 --> 21:38.698
- I'm not sure if that sounds
wonderful or horrible.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.769
- Yeah, me neither.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.946
Hey, sir, it's right...

21:53.980 --> 21:55.415
Sir?

21:58.385 --> 22:05.392
*

22:43.162 --> 22:45.164
- Uh, we have time
to go over our speech,

22:45.197 --> 22:46.666
grab some lunch.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.635
I'd love to see
Mata Amritanandamayi.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.136
She comes on
the main stage at 4:00.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.138
- If you have an M.Div.,
what degree is that?

22:52.171 --> 22:53.906
Is it Master of Divinity?

22:53.940 --> 22:55.551
- Uh, I believe so.
- That sounds about right.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.909
- M.T.S.?

22:56.943 --> 22:59.111
- Theological Studies, I think.
- Master.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.548
- Master.
- Yeah. The shuttle's this way.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.650
- Uh, I think I'm just gonna
walk around a bit,

23:03.683 --> 23:05.117
maybe take in
some of the lectures.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.662
- We should probably
go over this at least once.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.096
- No, best to keep it fresh.
- But, Cal...

23:08.120 --> 23:09.889
- Don't want it
to sound rehearsed, you know.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.467
That's the worst thing
we could do with this crowd.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.971
Call me when you're
heading back over.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.600
It's hurtful, it's hateful,

23:20.633 --> 23:23.903
not to mention
counter-fucking-productive.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.573
- It's a big idea, certainly.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.741
- This wasn't some idea

23:28.775 --> 23:31.043
I came up with
out of the blue, okay?

23:31.077 --> 23:32.979
This was a vision...

23:33.012 --> 23:35.882
Same as when I saw
that Steve was sick.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.884
You are either with me,
or you are not.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.553
- Envisioning faceless people
doesn't necessarily mean

23:40.587 --> 23:43.490
unraveling a policy
that's been around for...

23:45.658 --> 23:48.661
- See, you don't even remember
when the Denier policy started.

23:48.695 --> 23:51.230
- '81 or '82.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.065
- No, when The Movement
started to grow,

23:53.099 --> 23:56.135
Steve realized that he needed
to find a way

23:56.168 --> 23:58.070
to contain the people...
That is it.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.806
- You're suggesting
he was corrupt?

23:59.839 --> 24:01.941
- It was never a policy
to shun Deniers.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.644
Some of us chose to say
good-bye to people in our lives

24:04.677 --> 24:06.946
because they became toxic
to our growth...

24:06.979 --> 24:07.947
To our climb.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.181
Really?

24:09.215 --> 24:10.750
So that's why you said good-bye

24:10.783 --> 24:12.885
to Jeremiah
when he stopped believing?

24:12.919 --> 24:14.821
Because he was toxic
to your growth?

24:14.854 --> 24:16.055
- Yes.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.625
- That is bullshit.

24:18.658 --> 24:23.029
Once we decided that even our
own loved ones were dead to us

24:23.062 --> 24:26.733
because they didn't believe
exactly in what we did,

24:26.766 --> 24:30.537
we probably stopped truly...

24:30.570 --> 24:31.971
loving then too.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.806
- I can see why you want this.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.975
You've suffered
by that ideology.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.910
- This has nothing
to do with me.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.912
- You sure about that?

24:39.946 --> 24:42.181
Don't forget it's
ego of the individual

24:42.214 --> 24:45.151
that always threatens
the good of the whole.

24:57.263 --> 25:00.299
- Fuck!

25:00.332 --> 25:03.002
- Fuckin' shelf.
- You okay?

25:06.005 --> 25:08.875
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.983
- Are you okay?

25:17.016 --> 25:20.286
- Uh, I don't know.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.890
No.

25:23.923 --> 25:28.027
Sorry, maybe it's just
postpartum.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.897
Ugh, that's such
a shitty excuse.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.198
- Excuse for what?

25:35.735 --> 25:38.237
- It's all Russel.
- Mm.

25:38.270 --> 25:41.173
- His family, his world.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.843
My family disowned me
when I left their church,

25:43.876 --> 25:45.778
The Scent of Jesus in Flushing.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.914
- What does Christ
smell like again?

25:47.947 --> 25:50.116
- You're not a member.
- Mm-mm.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.098
- Sometimes I wonder if every
move I've made in my life

25:56.122 --> 25:57.657
has been to spite them.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.061
- Yeah, I've felt like that.

26:02.094 --> 26:06.365
- Have you ever felt like
the choices you made

26:06.398 --> 26:08.167
were never choices?

26:08.200 --> 26:11.103
Like the life you have
has been...

26:11.137 --> 26:13.840
assigned to you?

26:13.873 --> 26:16.575
- Yeah, I have felt
like that, yeah.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.179
Kind of feel like that now.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.688
You know, Nicole,

26:28.721 --> 26:30.289
I, uh...

26:30.322 --> 26:34.093
- Yeah?

26:34.126 --> 26:37.229
- You know, I...

26:37.263 --> 26:39.298
I like you.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.801
I really do.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.770
I-I just, you know...

26:43.803 --> 26:46.272
I-I can't, um...

26:46.305 --> 26:47.774
- I just...

26:51.343 --> 26:54.146
Sometimes I want something...

26:54.180 --> 26:55.648
One thing...

26:55.682 --> 26:57.884
That's just mine.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.787
Not the family,
not The Movement...

27:02.689 --> 27:03.890
Just about me.

27:11.964 --> 27:12.999
- I want you to know,

27:13.032 --> 27:15.835
whatever happens
in this moment...

27:15.868 --> 27:17.937
It's real...

27:17.970 --> 27:19.005
for me.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.323
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Wait, w-wait a minute.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.449
You're not gonna go
and unburden out loud

27:30.482 --> 27:32.752
about this afterwards, are you?

27:32.785 --> 27:35.254
- This is not the kind of thing
I want on tape,

27:35.287 --> 27:38.891
hanging around the archive room.

27:38.925 --> 27:41.060
- The unburdening tapes
are in the archive room?

27:46.999 --> 27:53.973
*

27:54.006 --> 27:57.243
* It don't matter anymore *

27:57.276 --> 28:01.113
* Who's keeping score

28:01.147 --> 28:03.449
* Nobody wins

28:03.482 --> 28:05.985
* When the hurtin' stones
begin *

28:06.018 --> 28:07.219
* I'm too tired tonight

28:12.759 --> 28:14.193
* I'm too tired to fight

28:14.226 --> 28:16.929
- Hey, uh, Tessa?
- Yes?

28:16.963 --> 28:20.767
- Hi, um, my name's Eddie Lane.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.002
I, uh...

28:23.035 --> 28:26.472
I married your sister, Sarah.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.074
- Wow.
- Yeah.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.275
- You're the one, huh?

28:29.308 --> 28:31.978
Holy shit.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.189
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.015
I'm done with Meyerism
and all its bullshit.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.150
- I left too.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.252
- You left... out?

28:40.286 --> 28:41.921
- Yeah.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.023
- Well, shit.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.328
Um, why don't we go downstairs?

28:49.361 --> 28:50.830
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.098
- That sounds great.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.933
- One cup of coffee.

29:19.158 --> 29:21.994
- Cal, where the hell are you?

29:31.403 --> 29:32.939
What have you been doing?

29:32.972 --> 29:34.182
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

29:34.206 --> 29:37.209
- Sorry, uh, um...

29:37.243 --> 29:38.210
I can't do this.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.478
Um...

29:39.511 --> 29:41.180
you're gonna have
to go on alone.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.949
- Cal, listen.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.483
I know losing your mom...

29:44.516 --> 29:47.419
- No, no, no, Sarah,
you should do this, all right?

29:47.453 --> 29:48.955
You're the one who saved us.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.465
You're the real
Guardian of the Light.

29:50.489 --> 29:51.891
You... you can do this.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.068
- I don't want to do this alone.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.460
- Yeah, but I can't do it.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.162
I can't do it.
I can't do it at all.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.364
- That's not fair.
- It's not a choice.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.032
- It's not for me either.

30:00.066 --> 30:02.401
I can't articulate
my conviction right now.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.370
- Well, I'm...

30:07.206 --> 30:10.309
I'm not sure I have any
conviction left to articulate.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.515
Quite the pickle we're in,

30:16.548 --> 30:19.051
being that we are
at the World Faith Conference.

30:19.085 --> 30:22.588
- We're scheduled to go onstage
in less than an hour.

30:28.961 --> 30:32.131
*

30:32.164 --> 30:34.500
I blackmailed them.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.235
All of them.

30:36.268 --> 30:39.071
The donors.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.839
You knew that, though, right?

30:43.109 --> 30:44.643
So do this for me.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.913
Do this for what I have done.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.647
Do it for me,
if for nothing else,

30:48.680 --> 30:52.384
or we have nothing.

30:52.418 --> 30:55.521
Make people believe.

30:57.656 --> 31:01.593
Make me believe. Okay?

31:01.627 --> 31:03.395
Okay?

31:03.429 --> 31:10.369
*

31:12.538 --> 31:14.974
- First...
- Yes?

31:17.143 --> 31:19.245
- I want to be clean
in your Eye.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.215
Yes. Yes.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.186
- I want to wash away
our Damage.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.230
- I want to be clean
in your Eye.

31:43.635 --> 31:47.239
- Because I...

31:47.273 --> 31:50.009
I see myself...

31:50.042 --> 31:52.078
reflected in you.

31:54.713 --> 31:58.150
With my Eye...

31:58.184 --> 32:00.386
I see you anew.

32:04.723 --> 32:07.193
With my Eye, I see you anew.

32:11.663 --> 32:15.301
- I see you anew.

32:15.334 --> 32:22.274
*

32:28.447 --> 32:29.615
It's over.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.083
- What's over? Us?

32:31.117 --> 32:32.518
We never were, Kodiak.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.289
- I wish I was
referring to us, Gab.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.258
I mean this...

32:39.291 --> 32:41.160
What Steve built.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.594
- But Sarah saved it.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.630
We're gonna be fine.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.635
- Things are gonna get ugly.

32:49.668 --> 32:52.438
- What? Why?

32:52.471 --> 32:53.672
Tell me.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.442
You're scaring me.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.410
Did Sarah do something?

32:58.444 --> 33:01.213
- It's all
smoke and mirrors, Gab...

33:01.247 --> 33:02.714
All of this.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.317
I needed Steve to be a God,

33:05.351 --> 33:07.119
and so he was.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.155
He needed me to be this madman,

33:09.188 --> 33:11.690
a... a victim he could save,

33:11.723 --> 33:13.225
and so I was.

33:13.259 --> 33:16.095
- I don't understand.
- Escape.

33:16.128 --> 33:19.498
Don't go down with it.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.600
Come with me.

33:24.636 --> 33:31.610
*

33:31.643 --> 33:36.482
- Don't you want to just
scream in your family's face,

33:36.515 --> 33:38.750
"I exist.
You can't ignore me.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.352
I'm a fucking human being"?

33:40.386 --> 33:41.629
- Of course I do.
- Don't you think I do?

33:41.653 --> 33:43.222
I've obsessed about this
for years.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.391
I've had hundreds
of hours of therapy.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.259
But you can't change
other people.

33:47.293 --> 33:48.803
You cannot get them
to see what you see.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.338
- No, no, I don't...
- I don't buy that.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.198
Okay? That's giving up.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.100
This needs to be fixed.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.502
All those broken families...
It's not fucking fair.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.204
- Grow the fuck up.

33:59.671 --> 34:02.408
- Hey, Tessa, I'm... I'm sor...
- Tessa.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.410
- Hi, I'm... I'm taking over
for Andrea.

34:04.443 --> 34:05.677
Can I get you a refill?

34:10.516 --> 34:13.284
- Ashley?
- Hi. Oh, my God.

34:13.319 --> 34:16.822
- Wow.
- Uh, how's Hawk?

34:16.855 --> 34:18.290
- I don't know.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.292
We're not talking right now.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.494
It's a long story.

34:22.527 --> 34:26.331
Uh, I do know he's living
in the city.

34:26.364 --> 34:27.433
Did you know that?

34:30.369 --> 34:32.603
- A clear sensorium

34:32.638 --> 34:35.674
and complex perceptual processes

34:35.706 --> 34:39.678
during a period
of apparent clinical death

34:39.710 --> 34:41.713
challenge the concept

34:41.746 --> 34:43.482
that consciousness

34:43.514 --> 34:46.485
is localized in the brain.

34:46.518 --> 34:49.788
This is a concept shared
by every faith tradition

34:49.821 --> 34:51.322
around the world.

34:51.357 --> 34:53.225
- And yet today...
- I don't want this.

34:53.259 --> 34:56.428
Science is proving it as fact.

35:11.177 --> 35:15.747
- How can this really
be all there is?

35:17.249 --> 35:19.151
How can there not be more?

35:19.185 --> 35:21.187
And how do we not find ourselves

35:21.220 --> 35:24.190
on the fast track to the grave?

35:24.223 --> 35:27.726
- We only have five minutes
on this planet.

35:27.759 --> 35:30.696
How do we make the most
of those five minutes?

35:30.729 --> 35:33.599
It's possible to take
the best parts of ourselves

35:33.632 --> 35:37.269
and take the five minutes
that the universe has given us

35:37.303 --> 35:39.838
and break it down into seconds,

35:39.871 --> 35:42.741
into milliseconds,
into nanoseconds

35:42.774 --> 35:45.377
and live in between
those seconds

35:45.411 --> 35:49.881
content, happy, and free.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.883
- My mother,

35:51.917 --> 35:54.953
who died recently,

35:54.986 --> 35:57.689
never once told me
she loved me...

35:57.723 --> 36:00.292
Never once.

36:00.326 --> 36:03.629
How do I make the most
of my five minutes

36:03.662 --> 36:05.897
knowing that?

36:05.931 --> 36:09.401
Acceptance, that's how.

36:09.435 --> 36:12.204
I-I accept that I have no...

36:12.238 --> 36:15.507
I had no control over my mother

36:15.541 --> 36:18.277
or her love.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.912
And I-I let her go.

36:20.946 --> 36:24.616
And I surround myself
with people who do love me.

36:26.918 --> 36:30.556
- Loving begins with you.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.724
Love begins with you,

36:32.758 --> 36:35.794
but it rarely ends with you.

36:35.827 --> 36:39.231
- It will lead you
into your own heart...

36:39.265 --> 36:41.467
Into yourself.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.436
And you will love yourself,

36:44.470 --> 36:48.340
and you will love others.

36:48.374 --> 36:52.344
And you will realize
just how much more there is

36:52.378 --> 36:54.446
to this existence.

37:21.507 --> 37:25.311
- Your mother said some things
before she died...

37:26.712 --> 37:28.647
Things that were hard to hear.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.385
- Yeah, well,
she tends to do that.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.656
Sorry you had to suffer
her venom.

37:42.394 --> 37:45.931
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Yeah.

37:48.467 --> 37:49.868
- That's me.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.329
- I just, um...

38:19.598 --> 38:21.967
I couldn't let you walk away.

38:25.371 --> 38:28.807
You're everything that...

38:28.840 --> 38:31.510
Everything I said up there

38:31.543 --> 38:33.011
was about you.

38:41.620 --> 38:48.560
*

38:54.433 --> 38:57.969
* This is a world
that I created *

38:58.003 --> 38:59.871
*

38:59.905 --> 39:03.975
* I created light

39:04.009 --> 39:05.744
* From sweetness

39:05.777 --> 39:07.613
* And darkness

39:07.646 --> 39:08.947
* Created light

39:08.980 --> 39:12.851
* This is a world
that I created *

39:12.884 --> 39:14.653
*

39:14.686 --> 39:18.857
* I created light

39:18.890 --> 39:23.829
* Created light

39:23.862 --> 39:28.066
* This is a world
that has been spoken *

39:28.099 --> 39:29.801
*

39:29.835 --> 39:33.639
* I created light

39:33.672 --> 39:36.141
* Created light

39:36.174 --> 39:39.978
* Oh, oh, oh

39:40.011 --> 39:43.782
* Oh-oh-oh

39:43.815 --> 39:47.486
* Oh, oh, oh

39:47.519 --> 39:51.189
* Oh-oh-oh

39:51.222 --> 39:54.726
* Oh-oh, oh

39:54.760 --> 39:58.530
* Oh, oh, oh

39:58.564 --> 40:02.568
* Oh-oh-oh

40:02.601 --> 40:06.037
* Oh-oh, oh

40:06.071 --> 40:09.475
* Oh, oh, oh

40:09.508 --> 40:13.178
* Oh-oh-oh

40:13.211 --> 40:16.782
* Oh, oh, oh

40:16.815 --> 40:20.652
* Oh-oh-oh

40:20.686 --> 40:26.124
* Oh-oh, oh

40:26.157 --> 40:33.098
*

40:36.067 --> 40:38.036
* Well, here it comes

40:46.211 --> 40:53.151
*

41:31.657 --> 41:33.925
- Hank.

41:33.959 --> 41:36.161
- Why are you contacting Tessa?

41:36.194 --> 41:37.796
- Wait, she told you?

41:37.829 --> 41:39.565
- She's my daughter.
- I talk to her, Eddie.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.967
Why are you contacting her?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
- Come in.

41:49.575 --> 41:54.512
Look, our families need
to be mended, Hank.

41:57.315 --> 41:59.551
I'm doing 8R.

41:59.585 --> 42:00.619
- What? Why?

42:00.652 --> 42:02.120
And with whom are you doing 8R?

42:02.153 --> 42:03.822
You've left The Movement.

42:03.855 --> 42:06.958
- I have.

42:06.992 --> 42:08.994
But I haven't left everything.

42:12.097 --> 42:15.601
Steve chose me.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.705
I'm climbing the rungs
with Richard and Felicia,

42:19.738 --> 42:22.941
and when I am ready,
I am going to replace Cal.

42:24.943 --> 42:28.880
Things can be better, Hank.

42:30.782 --> 42:33.685
We can all be back together.

42:33.719 --> 42:35.654
- Where did you get that?

42:35.687 --> 42:38.890
- Steve wanted me to have it.

42:41.893 --> 42:46.231
We can put all of this
back together.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.314
- Are you bleeding?

43:03.348 --> 43:10.221
*

43:21.700 --> 43:25.671
* Every day

43:25.704 --> 43:29.340
* In every way

43:29.374 --> 43:34.112
* I'm getting
better and better *
