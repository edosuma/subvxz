01:02.063 --> 01:04.361
<i>Why wouldn't we
bring up the first amendment?</i>

01:04.364 --> 01:07.632
<i>We have to stick to the constitution.
That is what made this country.</i>

01:35.730 --> 01:37.064
Don't die.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.568
Come on, photosynthesis.

02:24.846 --> 02:28.013
- That's a nice dress.
- Oh. Thank you.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.084
- I like your jacket.
- Thanks.

02:32.452 --> 02:36.121
- I hope our flight's on time.
- Oh, it is. See?

02:36.123 --> 02:39.992
This airline has an excellent
arrival-departure record.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.894
Um, I Googled it.

02:41.896 --> 02:44.797
And, um, it has a 98...

02:44.799 --> 02:47.099
No 96,
no 98 percent approval...

02:47.101 --> 02:49.567
online user
approval rating.

02:49.569 --> 02:52.071
Which is very incredibly
high, obviously.

02:52.073 --> 02:55.708
Um, and Rancho Cucamonga
Mary sent me three,

02:55.710 --> 02:59.613
who I trust implicitly,
was very effusive about it.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.885
- Yeah.
- And you get a snack.

03:04.886 --> 03:06.517
Great.

03:07.922 --> 03:09.889
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- What?

03:09.891 --> 03:11.522
You just took
a step forward there.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.926
- I didn't.
- Yeah, you did. You know you did.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.828
- I didn't realize.
- Oh, I see.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.629
I beg your pardon?

03:17.631 --> 03:21.800
- I s-see what you did. I know what you did. It's...
- What did I do?

03:21.802 --> 03:27.472
You came up alongside me, you know, with
your jacket and your face and charm,

03:27.474 --> 03:31.243
and you just, you know, talked to
me for a strategic amount of time,

03:31.245 --> 03:32.945
established your position,

03:32.947 --> 03:36.815
and then just casually, blatantly
stepped in front of me.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.650
Like I had
some sort of amnesia

03:38.652 --> 03:41.153
and couldn't remember 15 seconds in
the past when you were behind me.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.655
Untrue.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.858
Oh my... You just
did it again.

03:45.860 --> 03:49.094
This is like watching a
master at work in his dojo.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.996
- I mean...
- Here's what happened.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.799
I came to my gate, hoping
my flight was on time.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.868
I then attempted to start
a pleasant conversation,

03:55.870 --> 03:58.804
whereupon you revealed the tip of
the iceberg of your tendencies,

03:58.806 --> 04:01.740
and I was forced to take a step
forward to escape the vortex.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.977
Oh, my God.
Oh... Again! Oh!

04:04.979 --> 04:08.280
And now you're casting me as the author
of a Byzantine conspiracy theory

04:08.282 --> 04:10.648
of a Machiavellian land grab

04:10.650 --> 04:14.153
designed to usurp your position on
an aircraft that has eight seats.

04:14.155 --> 04:16.154
You know what? Okay.

04:16.156 --> 04:20.291
That's cra... If I'm wrong, just step in
back of me instead of in front of me.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.694
No, because that would mean
going past you again.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.697
I see. You know what?

04:25.699 --> 04:30.069
Five years ago, I would have said
something trite like, "Chivalry is dead."

04:30.071 --> 04:32.171
But this is worse
than unchivalrous.

04:32.173 --> 04:36.041
This is... You are
part and parcel of a world

04:36.043 --> 04:39.078
that no longer has any
idea how to behave itself.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.680
In fact, I draw a straight
line between people like you

04:42.682 --> 04:46.551
to investment bankers to
politicians to terrorists.

04:46.553 --> 04:51.223
You basically all have the same contempt
for decency and rules and any manners.

04:51.225 --> 04:54.860
And what's funny is there's
no way you can board first

04:54.862 --> 04:57.229
because the only way you could board
first is if you had a special need.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.031
Do you have
a special need?

04:59.033 --> 05:02.167
Yes, I need
to be over there.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.748
Fucker.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.877
- Fantastic.
- Wonderful.

05:44.611 --> 05:47.312
- Anybody want to trade seats?
- You're ridiculous.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.915
Anybody?
It's great back here.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.286
You've got
to be kidding me.

05:56.791 --> 05:57.892
Jesus.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.569
What brings you
to San Luis Obispo?

06:10.637 --> 06:12.304
- You don't have to.
- What?

06:12.306 --> 06:15.974
Talk. Honestly, I'd be
happier if you didn't.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.044
Fine.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.298
Dear God.
Tear it at the notch.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.666
There is no notch.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.435
- Give it to me.
- I'm not giving you...

06:43.437 --> 06:44.371
Give it to me.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.356
This one does not appear
to have a working notch.

07:09.230 --> 07:10.231
Yeah.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.366
Yeah.

07:20.341 --> 07:21.909
All that...

07:25.913 --> 07:27.081
Thank you.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.905
I'm actually
going to Paso Robles.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.139
They call it Paso "Roables."

07:54.141 --> 07:56.508
Well, the correct
pronunciation is Robles.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.777
But they call it "Roables."

07:58.779 --> 08:00.379
- Whatever.
- I hope it's a big place.

08:00.381 --> 08:02.114
It isn't.

08:02.116 --> 08:04.816
If I see you at a restaurant,
I'll go to another restaurant.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.885
I'm not going to be
in any restaurants.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.255
Why? Are you checking
into a mental institution?

08:10.257 --> 08:14.929
I'm going to that most presumptuous
of all things, a destination wedding.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.966
Please don't tell me
it's Keith and Anne's.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.335
How many weddings
can there possibly be

08:23.337 --> 08:25.537
on any given day
in Paso Robles?

08:25.539 --> 08:27.439
I was praying for two.

08:27.441 --> 08:30.108
And I was blaming Satan
for my seat assignment

08:30.110 --> 08:32.811
when it was actually
just Keith's assistant.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.947
And how do you know
the esteemed Keith?

08:34.948 --> 08:37.216
I was engaged to him
six years ago.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.985
- Oh, my God, you're Lindsay.
- Why, how do you know him?

08:39.986 --> 08:41.820
He and I have
the same mother.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.323
Holy shit,
you're Frank?

08:44.892 --> 08:47.292
Oh, you're even worse
than he said.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.961
You too.

08:58.239 --> 09:00.839
Oh, my God.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.343
Serious...

09:29.970 --> 09:32.537
- There was supposed to be a car.
- Our flight was early.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.273
Really?
It seemed so long.

09:34.275 --> 09:37.876
<i>Attention, passengers,
increased security measures</i>

09:37.878 --> 09:40.045
<i>require all passengers
to maintain</i>

09:40.047 --> 09:43.282
<i>close personal contact
with your bags at all times.</i>

09:52.026 --> 09:54.993
So how much do you know about what
happened between me and Keith?

09:54.995 --> 09:57.596
I know that he broke off your engagement
five weeks before the wedding.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.197
And now I know why.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.166
He said some shit
about you, boy.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.368
- Like what?
- Doesn't matter.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.605
Don't do that, don't dangle an injurious
tidbit and then snatch it away.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.041
Or what, I'll die alone?

10:09.043 --> 10:10.976
Keith is a panhandling
piece of garbage,

10:10.978 --> 10:12.377
and you're better off
without him.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.447
Which is saying something,
considering how bad off you are.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.016
Just pity the bride,
whoever she is.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.153
- You haven't met her?
- Just like I never met you.

10:21.155 --> 10:23.955
I stay as far away
from Keith as I can.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.426
My mother insisted I turn up for this shit show,
otherwise, I wouldn't be meeting you now.

10:27.428 --> 10:29.895
Isn't that nice
to think about?

10:29.897 --> 10:32.097
She said it's important to show
up because if you show up,

10:32.099 --> 10:34.466
the worst they can say is you're
horrendous, which is subjective.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.935
But not showing up
is objective.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.305
Well, you showed up.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.106
Why would you come
to his wedding?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.641
He broke your heart,
as I recall.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.576
Shattered, yes.

10:44.578 --> 10:46.244
Didn't you wind up
suing him?

10:46.246 --> 10:48.413
Well, I needed to lash out.

10:48.415 --> 10:52.017
Plus he cost my parents
$32,000 in deposits.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.652
- Did you win?
- There was a settlement.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.354
Did you feel better?

10:55.356 --> 10:58.457
Look, I came
because he invited me.

10:58.459 --> 11:01.259
He only invited you because he
wanted to act like a big person,

11:01.261 --> 11:04.296
not because he, in any way,
wanted you to come.

11:04.298 --> 11:09.201
You think I wanted to come? I'm
just trying to be the big person.

11:09.203 --> 11:12.339
See, this only works if one of
you actually is a big person.

11:13.474 --> 11:16.174
Well, also, I need closure.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.177
You don't have closure?
It was six years ago.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.147
Do I strike you as someone
who has closure?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.549
He's marrying someone else.
That's closure.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.984
It's closed.

11:25.986 --> 11:29.154
Closed is not
the same thing as closure.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.235
Any chance
they sent two cars?

12:11.265 --> 12:13.265
So, what do you do, Frank?

12:13.267 --> 12:16.601
That is, when you're not shining
your light upon the world.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.037
I run marketing
for J.D. Power and Associates.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.740
The "Car of the Year" people?

12:20.742 --> 12:22.541
No, that's a magazine.

12:22.543 --> 12:24.710
I bought one of your cars of the year.
It was a piece of crap.

12:24.712 --> 12:27.179
Again, a magazine.
Common error.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.748
Is that the career
you dreamed of?

12:28.750 --> 12:31.416
Handing out awards
by the fistful?

12:31.418 --> 12:34.352
Hugely successful company,
extremely well-respected.

12:34.354 --> 12:38.056
It's corporate brownnosing
on a national scale.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.325
International.
And don't sleep on awards.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.394
Our country lives
on self-congratulation.

12:42.396 --> 12:43.528
Let me ask you this.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.397
Has there ever been a car

12:45.399 --> 12:48.366
that wasn't a J.D. Power
and Associates Car of the Year?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.736
We don't do "Car of the
Year." That's a magazine.

12:50.738 --> 12:52.571
I've seen those
Lucite trophies.

12:52.573 --> 12:55.342
They're on every car commercial
for every car, ever.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.814
What do you do anyway?

13:01.816 --> 13:04.817
I prosecute companies
and institutions

13:04.819 --> 13:07.454
for culturally insensitive
actions or speech.

13:09.690 --> 13:11.724
You're the politically
correct police.

13:11.726 --> 13:13.391
No.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.594
You parse what people say and
do, and then accuse them

13:15.596 --> 13:19.130
of being racist or misogynist
or otherwise horrible.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.266
You destroy lives
and reputations for money.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.068
No.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.472
Is that what you dreamed of?
A career in reverse fascism?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.777
I can't remember dreaming.

15:02.904 --> 15:04.438
Wrong!

15:07.742 --> 15:09.811
I thought this was my closet.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.448
Are you expecting
a response of some kind?

15:15.616 --> 15:17.282
No.

15:17.284 --> 15:21.286
Uh, I see now that there
is a bolt on the door.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.188
So, we should use it.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.491
Yep.

16:10.504 --> 16:12.938
- How's your room?
- I'm just sleeping there.

16:12.940 --> 16:14.606
How's yours?

16:14.608 --> 16:17.308
I'll let you know after I run
a UV light over the sheets.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.911
We really shouldn't
speak anymore.

16:18.913 --> 16:20.612
If you think that's best.

16:20.614 --> 16:22.447
Do you think Keith
is trying to fix us up?

16:22.449 --> 16:23.716
Even he is smarter
than that.

16:23.718 --> 16:26.786
I don't know.
I mean, same flight.

16:26.788 --> 16:28.921
Seated next to each other
on the plane.

16:28.923 --> 16:31.423
Adjoining rooms.
Seated next to each other here.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.793
You think that's
all just coincidence?

16:33.795 --> 16:37.262
Keith has never had a thought
about another human being.

16:37.264 --> 16:40.465
So we're just the people
you don't know where to stick?

16:40.467 --> 16:42.567
Might as well
just stick us together.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.870
I don't want to be a person
you don't know where to stick.

16:44.872 --> 16:47.605
That is not the life
I imagined for myself.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.810
I'm sure your next life
will be better.

16:50.812 --> 16:54.646
Welp, here we go.

16:54.648 --> 16:55.715
So that's her.

16:55.717 --> 16:57.284
Yep.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.853
She is a tall glass
of hemlock.

17:00.855 --> 17:02.788
- She's Danish.
- Dutch, I thought.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.289
Danish.
From Denmark.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.025
I know where
Danish are from.

17:06.027 --> 17:07.792
He looks the same
as he used to.

17:07.795 --> 17:09.426
Plastic people don't age.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.996
Well, I was hoping he had.

17:10.998 --> 17:15.867
I was hoping he'd be less attractive
or on his way to obesity.

17:15.869 --> 17:18.705
Is this the first time you've seen
him since the crushing ending?

17:20.074 --> 17:21.741
- Is it bad?
- Yep.

17:21.742 --> 17:23.978
- As bad as you feared?
- Yeah. Worse.

17:27.013 --> 17:30.983
- How can this be the way the species is set up?
- I'm sorry?

17:30.985 --> 17:34.086
How can we be allowed
to feel so much for people

17:34.088 --> 17:36.521
who don't feel
anything for us?

17:36.523 --> 17:39.491
You're assuming that you're
normal, which is hilarious.

17:39.493 --> 17:42.660
- It's incredibly cruel.
- Well, look at it this way.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.931
For a time, you carved out a place in his life
when there really shouldn't have been one.

17:45.933 --> 17:47.599
That makes me a dipshit.

17:47.601 --> 17:49.902
I agree.
I was just humoring you.

17:49.904 --> 17:51.704
The truth is,
from puberty on in,

17:51.706 --> 17:54.006
we should all just
be playing defense.

17:54.008 --> 17:56.510
- "On in"? On in to what?
- Death.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.045
- Oh, God.
- Officer on deck.

18:00.047 --> 18:02.447
- So you got to know Mom.
- Plenty well enough.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.681
So you met her twice.

18:05.853 --> 18:07.485
Howard.

18:07.487 --> 18:11.123
- Oh, this fucking guy.
- Who's he with?

18:11.125 --> 18:12.490
His girlfriend.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.126
Howard left your mother?

18:14.128 --> 18:17.096
"Left" is not
a strong enough word. Fled.

18:17.098 --> 18:19.832
- For an older woman?
- He would have left for an otter.

18:19.834 --> 18:23.035
- Anyway, leaving is leaving.
- No, no.

18:23.037 --> 18:26.604
Leaving for a younger woman
is awful, it's horrible.

18:26.606 --> 18:30.408
But leaving for an older
woman is perverse.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.644
Mom would have been just
as angry about a younger one.

18:32.646 --> 18:34.980
Yeah, but she would've
been able to use her age

18:34.982 --> 18:37.917
to rail against
a gender-unfair society.

18:37.919 --> 18:40.920
I mean, leaving for a younger
woman's the least he could've done.

18:40.922 --> 18:42.922
My father left her
for a younger woman.

18:42.924 --> 18:45.557
She can think about that,
when she wants to cheer up.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.961
But she and your father eventually
made peace though, didn't they?

18:48.963 --> 18:51.130
Yep. Dad jumped out
a seventh-floor window,

18:51.132 --> 18:53.032
and Mom considered them
all square.

18:53.034 --> 18:54.767
- I'm sorry?
- Don't be.

18:54.769 --> 18:56.534
I was not a fan.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.138
Well, you're not a fan of
many people, is my sense.

18:59.140 --> 19:00.940
Well, this person
shot me, so...

19:00.942 --> 19:03.175
- He shot you?
- He did.

19:03.177 --> 19:06.712
He said I was the embodiment
of all his bad choices.

19:06.714 --> 19:09.114
- Did it hurt?
- Did it hurt?

19:09.116 --> 19:10.883
Is that a serious question?

19:10.885 --> 19:12.785
There's a metal missile
going into your body.

19:12.787 --> 19:14.854
Yes, it hurt.
It hurt a great deal.

19:14.856 --> 19:16.822
Well, what did you do?

19:16.824 --> 19:17.923
I ran at him.

19:17.925 --> 19:19.792
You ran at him?

19:19.794 --> 19:21.459
Why didn't you
run away from him?

19:21.461 --> 19:23.628
That didn't occur to me.
I was pissed off.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.131
He tried to shoot me again,
but he missed.

19:26.133 --> 19:30.435
I got the gun out of his hand, hit him in
the face with it, broke his orbital bone.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.872
- What did he do?
- He cried.

19:32.874 --> 19:34.372
Begged me to kill him.
I wouldn't.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.542
Not because I didn't want to, but because
I didn't want to fuck up my life.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.012
I mean, any more
than it already was.

19:40.014 --> 19:41.679
Turned out I didn't
have to kill him though,

19:41.681 --> 19:44.116
because that night,
he jumped.

19:44.118 --> 19:46.684
It's quite a family.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.021
Nobody's arguing.

19:49.023 --> 19:53.025
You can't call a
78-year-old woman your "girlfriend."

19:53.027 --> 19:54.525
It's ridiculous.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.928
What should I call her then?

19:55.930 --> 19:59.932
I don't know. An ossified,
pre-dead corpse-friend?

19:59.934 --> 20:02.234
Is that in the politically
correct handbook?

20:02.236 --> 20:04.236
I'm off the clock.

20:04.238 --> 20:06.138
She just needs a little
more hair and makeup.

20:06.140 --> 20:08.941
I think we passed
a mortician on the way in.

20:08.943 --> 20:10.642
Travel with her
on your arm,

20:10.644 --> 20:13.178
you'd better know where the
funeral parlors are at all times.

20:13.180 --> 20:16.481
And by "On your arm,"
you mean both figuratively

20:16.483 --> 20:19.051
and for actual
physical support.

20:19.053 --> 20:21.619
- I've never met her.
- Better hurry.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.156
I guess the heart wants
what the heart wants.

20:24.158 --> 20:26.759
Or whatever the
pacemaker says it can have.

20:26.761 --> 20:28.559
Apparently,
they went to the same college.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.729
She was a senior
when he was a freshman.

20:30.731 --> 20:33.032
Well, she's a senior again.

20:34.969 --> 20:38.704
- Are you gonna say hello?
- Yep. Are you?

20:38.706 --> 20:41.040
Yep.

20:41.042 --> 20:42.875
Have a nice time.

21:51.879 --> 21:55.147
- You okay?
- Nope. You?

21:55.149 --> 21:57.251
I'm all fucked up
and I always will be.

21:58.986 --> 22:03.991
You think anyone will notice
if I... go back to the hotel?

22:05.326 --> 22:06.293
Nope.

22:07.194 --> 22:08.129
Yeah.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.697
All right.

22:30.885 --> 22:33.786
Psst.

22:33.788 --> 22:38.192
I mean, not to throw
stones, but he has a lot going on.

22:39.626 --> 22:41.994
I mean... I mean, I know
I have mine,

22:41.996 --> 22:44.363
but my father
never <i>shot</i> me.

22:44.365 --> 22:47.966
I don't think he ever
even touched a gun.

22:47.968 --> 22:52.204
I mean, there was that one time I
put those two boxes of Band-Aids

22:52.206 --> 22:57.142
on my doll and he,
like, barely patted me.

22:57.144 --> 22:59.878
Like, you couldn't
even call it a spanking.

22:59.880 --> 23:05.084
It was like... He was
apologizing forever for it.

23:05.086 --> 23:06.320
And he still feels bad.

23:08.655 --> 23:11.757
I mean, seven floors.

23:11.759 --> 23:14.426
I wonder if there was more
floors he could of just gone up

23:14.428 --> 23:16.063
so he could die instantly.

23:17.098 --> 23:20.265
Not like...

23:20.267 --> 23:22.301
Can you die... How many...

23:22.303 --> 23:24.371
I don't know. I guess
it depends on the building.

23:25.906 --> 23:27.272
Very, very...

23:27.274 --> 23:30.344
Just psychologically,
it's just interesting, but...

23:34.215 --> 23:36.081
<i>You don't think.</i>

23:36.083 --> 23:39.785
<i>He stole from me, from his
employer, from Katherine March.</i>

23:39.787 --> 23:43.090
<i>My wife... I mean
my former wife is correct.</i>

23:44.358 --> 23:45.692
<i>I really can paint.</i>

23:48.162 --> 23:50.729
<i>My copies were so bad
I had to destroy them.</i>

23:50.731 --> 23:52.233
<i>For God's sake, he's lying.</i>

23:54.902 --> 23:57.138
Because he's left-handed,
you idiot.

23:58.772 --> 24:01.340
<i>He told me
Miss March painted them.</i>

24:01.342 --> 24:03.008
<i>In my expert opinion...</i>

24:15.489 --> 24:19.424
<i>He said he was going to fix
it when he left my place around 2:00 a.m.</i>

24:19.426 --> 24:22.494
<i>That's when I told him...</i>

24:22.496 --> 24:24.963
<i>So he
kills her with my ice pick.</i>

24:24.965 --> 24:27.799
<i>And I heard her say,
"'Hello, Johnnie' before she hung up."</i>

24:27.801 --> 24:29.334
<i>He was there all right.</i>

24:29.336 --> 24:30.969
<i>Well, what I don't understand</i>

24:30.971 --> 24:32.204
<i>is this talk
about her being an artist.</i>

24:32.206 --> 24:33.805
<i>I never saw her paint.</i>

24:33.807 --> 24:35.841
<i>That was one
of her peculiar traits.</i>

24:35.843 --> 24:37.778
<i>She never let anyone
see her paint.</i>

24:58.265 --> 25:02.501
I would not have guessed, Frank, that you
were a man who enjoyed a foot massage.

25:02.503 --> 25:07.372
I'm not. When I saw the complimentary
chit in the wedding welcome basket,

25:07.374 --> 25:09.408
I thought, "I don't want that.

25:09.410 --> 25:11.476
I'm not comfortable with other
people touching my feet.

25:11.478 --> 25:13.879
I don't see why
it's necessary or good."

25:13.881 --> 25:15.914
Then why are you here?

25:15.916 --> 25:18.350
Because it's a $30 value,
and throwing it away

25:18.352 --> 25:20.419
would have bothered me
even more than this does.

25:20.421 --> 25:21.820
So, you're cheap.

25:21.822 --> 25:23.288
Oh, I'm way worse
than cheap,

25:23.290 --> 25:25.824
especially when it comes to free shit...
I hoard free shit.

25:25.826 --> 25:27.359
Especially
the gray-area free shit,

25:27.361 --> 25:30.495
like the nail files and disposable
slippers in the hotel room.

25:30.497 --> 25:32.164
"Gray area."

25:32.166 --> 25:34.166
I tell myself that they
want me to take it,

25:34.168 --> 25:35.867
that I'm intended
to take it.

25:35.869 --> 25:37.269
Do you take
the shoehorns?

25:37.271 --> 25:39.071
Not the long ones,
only the short ones.

25:39.073 --> 25:42.407
Well, that's not a gray area,
that's theft. You're a thief.

25:42.409 --> 25:45.877
Do you take the shampoo,
conditioner, and body wash?

25:45.879 --> 25:48.213
I used to, but then one
leaked in my suitcase.

25:48.215 --> 25:50.882
Huh. What about the soaps?

25:50.884 --> 25:52.484
Not the round soaps
wrapped in paper.

25:52.486 --> 25:55.220
But the bigger ones,
in the boxes? Yes, I do.

25:55.222 --> 25:59.191
So, you're a minor person
with grubby hands.

25:59.193 --> 26:02.127
I don't understand how, even after
Keith did what he did to you,

26:02.129 --> 26:04.396
and even in the midst
of the shame of being here,

26:04.398 --> 26:06.898
you can possibly still
be mooning over him.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.400
That's because
you're a monkey

26:08.402 --> 26:10.902
who doesn't understand
the human condition.

26:10.904 --> 26:12.838
Having met you, I understand
why it's a condition.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.239
You don't stop
loving a person

26:14.241 --> 26:16.475
just because
they injure you.

26:16.477 --> 26:17.909
It helps.

26:17.911 --> 26:20.545
- Well, love is not rational.
- Clearly.

26:20.547 --> 26:22.381
But how could you
even like Keith?

26:22.383 --> 26:25.117
- I never said I liked him.
- Then how can you love him?

26:25.119 --> 26:27.119
Love has nothing
to do with like.

26:27.121 --> 26:30.455
- Healthy people would disagree.
- Healthy people are sick.

26:30.457 --> 26:33.925
Isn't there a part of you that just
wants to wish him well and move on?

26:33.927 --> 26:37.562
Mmm... Most of me wants him
to be found in an icy river.

26:37.564 --> 26:40.932
It makes no sense to want the
person you love to be dead.

26:40.934 --> 26:43.268
Because then you'd have no one
left to love except yourself.

26:43.270 --> 26:45.539
Which, in your case,
would be unrequited.

26:47.074 --> 26:50.609
- I really don't want him dead.
- Good.

26:50.611 --> 26:53.879
I want him to have a long life, during
which he is miserable every single day

26:53.881 --> 26:56.348
before slowly
dying of regret.

26:56.350 --> 26:59.251
There are seven billion people
in the world.

26:59.253 --> 27:01.353
So when one of them
behaves badly toward you,

27:01.355 --> 27:04.289
he's actually doing you a great
favor because he's saving you time.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.658
He's telling you that
he's not worth your while.

27:06.660 --> 27:09.127
He's freeing you to say,
"Thank you for the information.

27:09.129 --> 27:16.601
I will now move on to
the 6,999,999,999 other people,

27:16.603 --> 27:19.438
some of whom
may have some value."

27:19.440 --> 27:21.173
And is that what
you've done, Frank?

27:21.175 --> 27:23.508
Just sifted,
calmly and sensibly,

27:23.510 --> 27:26.978
through the entire population,
searching for your soul mate?

27:26.980 --> 27:30.115
No, I have opted out, which
makes me uniquely qualified

27:30.117 --> 27:32.017
to observe and comment
on your situation.

27:32.019 --> 27:33.487
Oh, I am so lucky.

27:35.055 --> 27:37.389
- It was a long time ago.
- Not an eternity.

27:37.391 --> 27:41.526
- You were both very young.
- Old enough to know right from wrong.

27:41.528 --> 27:43.929
Incidentally, I spoke
to the bride last night.

27:43.931 --> 27:47.032
Oh, she does not have the
sense God gave a toaster.

27:47.034 --> 27:50.302
She's a moron, and her breasts
were built on a medical bench.

27:50.304 --> 27:53.706
But she said to tell you that
she hopes you can be friends.

27:53.708 --> 27:55.374
You talked about me?

27:55.376 --> 27:57.042
She didn't give you
a lot of airtime.

27:57.044 --> 27:59.177
She has trouble
stringing sentences together.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.113
And she uses a lot
of personal pronouns,

28:01.115 --> 28:03.315
so you're not always quite sure
who she's talking about.

28:03.317 --> 28:05.183
Well done, Keith.

28:05.185 --> 28:09.221
But if it helps, she said
she's not threatened by you.

28:09.223 --> 28:12.190
Yes, that helps
tremendously.

28:12.192 --> 28:13.692
At least I think
she was talking about you.

28:15.262 --> 28:19.331
She said "her." I'm pretty
sure she meant you.

28:19.333 --> 28:23.168
- Wow. What do you care anyway?
- I don't.

28:23.170 --> 28:26.138
I'm just trying to amuse myself
and get to tomorrow.

28:26.140 --> 28:28.509
Do you care
about anything?

28:30.277 --> 28:32.513
How many times in your life
have you been in love?

28:33.680 --> 28:35.447
Once.

28:35.449 --> 28:36.984
What was it like?

28:54.368 --> 28:57.402
How does anybody drink wine
at 11:00 in the morning?

28:57.404 --> 28:59.137
It's a winery, Frank.

28:59.139 --> 29:02.140
Haven't you ever given out a Car
of the Year award at 11:00?

29:02.142 --> 29:03.544
I can still taste toothpaste.

29:06.346 --> 29:09.281
- You were absolutely right.
- What did you say?

29:09.283 --> 29:12.150
A destination wedding
is presumptuous.

29:12.152 --> 29:14.386
"Please drag your carcass
hundreds of miles

29:14.388 --> 29:16.621
to excessively celebrate
our happiness."

29:16.623 --> 29:19.191
Yeah. "Because our
wedding is so special,

29:19.193 --> 29:21.460
it needs to be
an epic imposition."

29:21.462 --> 29:25.096
"It's far too important to celebrate
in anybody's shit-ass hometown."

29:25.098 --> 29:29.100
"Or on one calendar day. So kindly
give up your entire weekend."

29:29.102 --> 29:32.137
"And spend a fuck-ton of your own
money, over and above the gift."

29:32.139 --> 29:34.239
I bet you loved
the minibar prices.

29:34.241 --> 29:35.576
It's like 80 cents
per cashew.

29:37.712 --> 29:39.411
What's hilarious
is that these two

29:39.413 --> 29:42.080
have no idea they're
in a fool's paradise.

29:42.082 --> 29:44.149
You really think that?

29:44.151 --> 29:47.319
I've spent most of my life dodging the
shrapnel from my mother's marriages,

29:47.321 --> 29:50.756
both of which started
with smiles as big as theirs.

29:50.758 --> 29:52.691
Some marriages work out.

29:52.693 --> 29:55.193
Yes, and some people
have six fingers.

29:55.195 --> 29:57.195
So I'm guessing
you're single.

29:57.197 --> 29:59.331
I decided to learn
from my parents' mistakes.

29:59.333 --> 30:01.600
It's a form
of evolution.

30:01.602 --> 30:05.337
Yeah, but you can't blame people for
believing their own lives will be different.

30:05.339 --> 30:09.107
Yes, I can.
It's incredibly egotistical.

30:09.109 --> 30:12.577
It might help you to consider the
idea that heartbreak is pointless,

30:12.579 --> 30:14.279
because if you had
wound up with the person,

30:14.281 --> 30:17.115
eventually, you would've
been miserable anyway.

30:17.117 --> 30:19.184
Actually that does help,
thank you.

30:19.186 --> 30:21.754
No problem.

30:21.756 --> 30:24.656
But don't you believe there's
someone for everyone?

30:24.658 --> 30:26.124
Close.

30:26.126 --> 30:28.629
I believe that there's
nobody for anyone.

30:45.813 --> 30:49.281
I wish your mother and Howard's
corpse-friend were playing.

30:49.283 --> 30:53.118
They could try and dislodge
each other's tunnel catheters.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.120
Have you talked
to the corpse-friend?

30:55.122 --> 30:58.824
Briefly. She's dull, and she
needs a week at depilatory camp.

30:58.826 --> 31:02.160
- Maybe she's rich.
- I sure hope so.

31:02.162 --> 31:03.263
Get her!

31:05.332 --> 31:07.299
Do you ever think
it's a crutch though,

31:07.301 --> 31:09.568
blaming your mother and
father for everything?

31:09.570 --> 31:11.336
When did crutches
get a bad name?

31:11.338 --> 31:12.905
When you have a broken leg,
you need a crutch.

31:12.907 --> 31:15.440
In fact, it would be stupid
not to have a crutch.

31:15.442 --> 31:17.743
Well, yeah,
but broken legs heal.

31:17.745 --> 31:20.145
I mean don't you have
a responsibility to yourself

31:20.147 --> 31:24.182
to eventually cast aside the
crutches and meet new challenges?

31:24.184 --> 31:26.451
If the parent-child bond
is diseased,

31:26.453 --> 31:30.622
you have a better chance of being a
sociopath than of being well-adjusted.

31:30.624 --> 31:32.624
I consider it a triumph
of the will

31:32.626 --> 31:36.194
that there aren't shallow graves
dotting my backyard.

31:36.196 --> 31:39.564
Besides, who are you to talk?

31:39.566 --> 31:43.903
Simple heartbreak like yours should be,
relatively speaking, a piece of cake to get over.

31:43.905 --> 31:45.838
Well, it's not.

31:45.840 --> 31:49.507
I'd rather be strong and ruined
than weak and ruined.

31:49.509 --> 31:52.444
I'm not weak.
I just have hope.

31:52.446 --> 31:54.379
That's the same thing.

32:10.430 --> 32:14.399
How do you not install steps
or a pathway for this shit?

32:14.401 --> 32:16.568
They warned us. It was
in the Welcome Basket.

32:16.570 --> 32:18.570
This is a fucking
liability nightmare.

32:18.572 --> 32:20.840
That's right,
sue Keith again.

32:20.842 --> 32:22.908
Can't we just get the van
to drive us up?

32:22.910 --> 32:25.543
- We're going 90 feet.
- Well, the heels won't make it.

32:25.545 --> 32:27.545
Then take them off
until we get there.

32:27.547 --> 32:29.915
- I just got a foot massage.
- So?

32:29.917 --> 32:33.351
I'm not gonna show up at my
ex-fiancé's wedding with dirty feet.

32:33.353 --> 32:35.855
You can clean them off
at the grape wash.

32:35.857 --> 32:38.690
- Can't you just carry me, please?
- What?

32:38.692 --> 32:41.827
- I can't believe I have to ask.
- What?

32:41.829 --> 32:44.362
- It's 90 feet.
- How much do you weigh?

32:44.364 --> 32:46.598
- Frank.
- I don't want to shed my mortal coil.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.770
Well, if that happens,
you can put me down.

33:00.414 --> 33:02.614
You have a high,
specific gravity.

33:02.616 --> 33:04.416
Yeah, dense bones.

33:04.418 --> 33:06.584
Really deceptive avoirdupois.

33:06.586 --> 33:09.320
This is the slowest
I've ever been carried.

33:09.322 --> 33:10.890
Oh, dear God, be quiet.

33:10.892 --> 33:12.624
Can you just let me off
at the top though,

33:12.626 --> 33:14.659
so no one sees
that you carried me?

33:14.661 --> 33:18.496
Why? Maybe Keith will get
jealous and rethink everything.

33:18.498 --> 33:20.632
Keith has
forgotten I'm here.

33:26.007 --> 33:26.941
Fuck me.

33:34.816 --> 33:37.983
It's 800 degrees.

33:37.985 --> 33:40.385
Why is the minister
in a seersucker suit?

33:40.387 --> 33:41.586
Because he's not a minister.

33:41.588 --> 33:42.955
He's Keith's friend
from college.

33:42.957 --> 33:44.824
Levy, I think his name is.

33:44.826 --> 33:46.926
- Kaplan?
- Kaplan, right.

33:46.928 --> 33:49.294
- Is he wearing makeup?
- Always.

33:49.296 --> 33:51.596
Usually
the Nars Radiant Creamy.

33:51.598 --> 33:53.465
If memory serves,
he's gay.

33:53.467 --> 33:57.669
The correct term is "Effeminate
American." And actually he's pansexual.

33:57.671 --> 33:59.071
What does that mean?

33:59.073 --> 34:01.006
He's attracted
to all genders,

34:01.008 --> 34:03.809
gender identities,
and sexual orientations.

34:03.811 --> 34:05.845
- Come on.
- I'm telling you.

34:05.847 --> 34:07.645
How'd he get the gig?

34:07.647 --> 34:09.380
He fucked the bride
and the groom.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.984
- Which was, like, no big deal.
- Vanilla.

34:11.985 --> 34:14.518
I mean, because he would fuck, for
example, a man who believes he's a woman?

34:14.521 --> 34:16.054
Absolutely.

34:16.056 --> 34:18.924
Or a straight woman who believes
she's actually a gay man?

34:18.926 --> 34:21.025
- Not a day goes by.
- What about hermaphrodites?

34:21.027 --> 34:22.594
You'd have to think.

34:22.596 --> 34:24.797
They just let anyone
officiate at weddings?

34:24.799 --> 34:28.565
Not anyone. You need a credit
card and an Internet connection.

34:28.568 --> 34:31.904
- You researched this?
- Oh, I researched everything.

34:31.906 --> 34:33.873
I knew where
we would buy a house,

34:33.875 --> 34:36.876
where our kids would be born,
where they'd go to school.

34:36.878 --> 34:38.612
I knew where we'd be buried.

34:41.748 --> 34:44.784
Do you become a clergyman in
an online church of some sort?

34:44.786 --> 34:46.918
No, you can
just do weddings.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.021
- Not baptisms?
- No.

34:49.023 --> 34:52.056
- Funerals? Bar Mitzvahs?
- Just weddings.

34:52.059 --> 34:55.828
- How many believers does he have?
- No believers. No congregation.

34:55.830 --> 34:58.998
- Does his church preach that there's a heaven?
- Ain't got no church.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.701
Why would anyone have my
mother as the maid of honor?

35:02.703 --> 35:06.604
I don't know. It's like having
the Grim Reaper at your CAT scan.

35:06.606 --> 35:10.508
If I had a nickel for every time she
said to me, "I am not your maid."

35:10.510 --> 35:14.146
- Was she born during the Great Depression?
- No, she caused it.

35:14.148 --> 35:16.581
- You know who I feel sorry for?
- Yourself?

35:16.583 --> 35:18.083
Anne's father.

35:18.085 --> 35:20.618
Why? He's the only one here
who wasn't married to my mother.

35:20.620 --> 35:25.825
Because once upon a time, he was the Most
Important Male Person In Anne's Life,

35:25.827 --> 35:28.794
the "M.P.I.A.L." if you will.

35:28.796 --> 35:31.096
I will, but only
if I have to.

35:31.098 --> 35:34.532
It's dangerous for a father
to pass that mantle.

35:34.534 --> 35:37.903
Just because he's Danish doesn't mean
he was fucking his own daughter.

35:37.905 --> 35:41.173
In a very real sense,
by virtue of cultivating

35:41.175 --> 35:45.577
a healthy, loving relationship with
her, showing her, day after day,

35:45.579 --> 35:48.080
year after year, how a good
man should comport himself,

35:48.082 --> 35:50.816
he's been preparing
her whole life for marriage.

35:50.818 --> 35:53.418
- To Keith.
- Exactly.

35:53.420 --> 35:55.721
That's the lamb to
the slaughter right there.

35:55.723 --> 35:59.191
She and her dad have been leading with
their chins, cruising for a bruising.

35:59.193 --> 36:01.426
Asking for it.
It's a total sucker play.

36:01.428 --> 36:02.928
Or so you've heard.

36:02.930 --> 36:05.130
There's a sucker that reaches
age of consent every minute.

36:05.132 --> 36:08.533
When Keith turns out to be
the mythic jerk that he is,

36:08.535 --> 36:12.104
all of her carefully curated
self-esteem will be destroyed,

36:12.106 --> 36:15.542
a father will have lost a
daughter, and where will she be?

36:16.610 --> 36:18.476
Right here
with the rest of us.

36:40.968 --> 36:42.669
I used to love this song.

36:44.005 --> 36:46.138
Do you want to dance?

36:46.140 --> 36:47.875
- I said "used to."
- Fine.

36:49.977 --> 36:52.577
- Why, do you want to dance?
- Of course not, I hate dancing.

36:52.579 --> 36:54.980
It's moronic and a
complete waste of time.

36:54.982 --> 36:57.783
You're not that busy.

36:57.785 --> 37:01.120
I just thought maybe you wanted to
dance to get your mind off things.

37:01.122 --> 37:03.255
I don't and it wouldn't.

37:03.257 --> 37:06.792
Fine. I said fine.

37:06.794 --> 37:08.763
Neither of us wants
to fucking dance.

37:13.167 --> 37:16.636
I can't help but hope
Keith tears a hip muscle.

37:26.047 --> 37:27.915
Can we take a walk?

37:54.775 --> 37:56.976
- How are the shoes?
- They're fine.

37:56.978 --> 37:59.244
I didn't really want to go through
the whole entire selection,

37:59.246 --> 38:02.781
but I have weird arches
on my mom's side.

38:02.783 --> 38:04.783
- So they're good.
- Yeah.

38:04.785 --> 38:06.318
Okay.

38:06.320 --> 38:08.754
You know after
the whole thing with Keith,

38:08.756 --> 38:12.725
- I was diagnosed with PTSD.
- Rich person's PTSD.

38:12.727 --> 38:15.693
- Privileged person's PTSD.
- Okay, I do know what you're saying.

38:15.695 --> 38:17.595
This is why people
hate the top one percent.

38:17.597 --> 38:20.332
- I am not the top one percent.
- Neither am I.

38:20.334 --> 38:23.702
When people talk about the top
one percent like it's home,

38:23.704 --> 38:25.170
it drives me fucking crazy.

38:25.172 --> 38:26.939
You know who's actually
in the top one percent

38:26.941 --> 38:28.841
are the assholes
that run the companies

38:28.843 --> 38:31.076
that I prosecute
and you reward.

38:31.078 --> 38:33.946
Top ten, top 20 percent,
whatever it is.

38:33.948 --> 38:36.115
The segment of society
that doesn't have to worry

38:36.117 --> 38:39.218
about basic things like food,
clothing, shelter, transportation,

38:39.220 --> 38:40.953
or getting shot
by the police.

38:40.955 --> 38:42.620
So we're not allowed
to have problems?

38:42.622 --> 38:44.790
We're allowed to have them, but
no one is interested in them.

38:44.792 --> 38:47.226
And I don't blame them,
I'm not even interested.

38:47.228 --> 38:50.262
We're trite, trivial,
tiresome, tone-deaf narcissists.

38:50.264 --> 38:52.931
I never said I wasn't
a tone-deaf narcissist.

38:52.933 --> 38:54.867
- The optics are very bad.
- Nobody's looking.

38:54.869 --> 38:56.201
We should keep our shit
to ourselves.

38:56.203 --> 38:58.337
We are keeping it
to ourselves.

38:58.339 --> 39:02.607
Besides, it's human nature to find pain in
any situation, however relatively fortunate.

39:02.609 --> 39:04.743
That doesn't
make it listenable.

39:04.745 --> 39:08.313
Well, I'm sorry if my brand of pain
is out of vogue, but it's all I got.

39:08.315 --> 39:10.883
It would be so much more
interesting and fantastic

39:10.885 --> 39:13.152
if we had been
fondled by priests

39:13.154 --> 39:16.088
or lost a leg but could
still feel it or something.

39:17.858 --> 39:21.659
My theory about
myself is that my soma

39:21.661 --> 39:25.798
is sending me a Darwinian
message telling me,

39:25.800 --> 39:29.068
"Hey, you're unfit to pass your
DNA on to future generations,

39:29.070 --> 39:31.103
so you should just select out."

39:31.105 --> 39:33.872
Well, just keep doing
what you're doing.

39:33.874 --> 39:36.275
But I have
so much to give.

39:36.277 --> 39:37.912
Not really.

39:39.246 --> 39:41.947
Holy shit, Frank.
What is that?

39:41.949 --> 39:43.681
I think it's a mountain lion.

39:43.683 --> 39:46.952
- Could it be a jaguar?
- I don't know. I'm not a zookeeper.

39:46.954 --> 39:48.987
It's too big for an
ocelot or a bearcat,

39:48.989 --> 39:50.989
but too small
for a panther, I think.

39:50.991 --> 39:53.392
What the fuck difference does it make
what it is? It's a fucking predator cat.

39:53.394 --> 39:54.960
A cougar, maybe?

39:54.962 --> 39:57.062
- Jesus Christ.
- I don't know what you're worried about.

39:57.064 --> 39:58.764
- It's gonna go for me.
- Why?

39:58.766 --> 40:00.999
I saw a thing. They pick out
the smallest of the herd.

40:01.001 --> 40:02.334
We're not a herd,
we're wedding guests.

40:02.336 --> 40:04.369
I'm telling you,
you're safe if you just run.

40:04.371 --> 40:05.838
You run.
I'll stay here and fight.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.306
Uh, yeah,
but I'm not a sprinter.

40:07.308 --> 40:10.075
I run for distance, so it
gives me a certain clarity...

40:10.077 --> 40:11.710
Yes, all right.

40:11.712 --> 40:13.045
You run.
I'll stay here and fight.

40:13.047 --> 40:15.280
How about if we both run
and nobody stays and fights?

40:15.282 --> 40:16.982
Neither one of us
can outrun a cheetah.

40:16.984 --> 40:18.784
It's not a fucking cheetah.
We're not in Africa.

40:18.786 --> 40:20.953
They're also in Iran,
I think it said.

40:20.955 --> 40:22.421
They won't even
hear us scream.

40:22.423 --> 40:24.223
I hate those
fucking people.

40:24.225 --> 40:26.825
On the plus side, you'll be ruining Keith's wedding.

40:26.827 --> 40:29.361
- That's true.
- Unless they don't find us for weeks.

40:29.363 --> 40:32.197
And then only in pieces, some of
which were brought back to its lair.

40:33.834 --> 40:35.467
Last chance on the running.

40:35.469 --> 40:38.437
I can't believe you're the last human
person I'm ever gonna talk to.

40:38.439 --> 40:40.005
There might be EMTs.

40:40.007 --> 40:42.808
Yeah, but I might
be a hemophiliac.

40:42.810 --> 40:44.810
Might be?
Don't you know that already?

40:44.812 --> 40:48.780
Well, no, because you can get things
as an adult, like adult onset asthma.

40:48.782 --> 40:51.085
My friend Suzanne has that...

41:06.934 --> 41:09.468
- Now we run!
- Oh!

41:09.470 --> 41:11.870
- That was good, Frank.
- My throat is really raw.

41:11.872 --> 41:13.272
But why are
we still running?

41:13.274 --> 41:14.640
Because I don't
think it's a bad idea

41:14.642 --> 41:17.476
to put as much distance between us
and the mountain lion as possible.

41:17.478 --> 41:18.977
It might've
been a lynx!

41:18.979 --> 41:20.279
It would be so
ironic if I strangled you.

41:20.281 --> 41:22.514
Why do you have to ruin
a nice moment!

41:22.516 --> 41:26.118
- Ow!
- Ah, fuck! Ah, fuck!

41:26.120 --> 41:29.188
- Ow! Ow!
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

41:29.190 --> 41:30.457
Ah!

41:32.760 --> 41:34.694
Okay. Oh.

41:37.531 --> 41:39.800
For the record,
you ruined the moment, not me.

41:43.204 --> 41:44.772
Lindsay?

41:46.106 --> 41:47.441
Lindsay?

41:49.810 --> 41:53.779
I'm fine!
For God's sake. Jesus.

41:53.781 --> 41:57.182
- Great.
- I just had the wind knocked out of me.

41:57.184 --> 41:59.084
Okay, good.

41:59.086 --> 42:02.421
It was good, because you didn't have
the first clue what you were doing.

42:02.423 --> 42:05.257
Hey, it's been a while
since health class.

42:05.259 --> 42:08.160
Yeah, well, if you thought
I had a cervical injury,

42:08.162 --> 42:10.462
the last thing you're supposed
to do is flip a person over

42:10.464 --> 42:12.397
like a fuckin' pancake.

42:12.399 --> 42:17.069
- I'm sorry.
- But on the other hand, you did save me.

42:17.071 --> 42:18.270
Us.

42:18.272 --> 42:21.006
I told you,
it would have gone for me.

42:21.008 --> 42:23.809
Why did you do that?
Why did you save me?

42:23.811 --> 42:24.511
I didn't save you.

42:25.913 --> 42:27.446
Why did you save me?

42:27.448 --> 42:28.981
Because I'm an idiot.

42:28.983 --> 42:32.384
- You could've died.
- Of idiocy.

42:32.386 --> 42:34.355
Don't tell me
you're secretly noble.

42:35.322 --> 42:36.521
I'm not.

42:36.523 --> 42:37.889
But I thought,
"Maybe she's right.

42:37.891 --> 42:39.258
Maybe hers
is the life in danger.

42:39.260 --> 42:41.960
She seems to know
fuckin' everything."

42:41.962 --> 42:45.430
And I didn't want to feel guilty for the
rest of my life about not having saved you.

42:45.432 --> 42:47.065
I get that.

42:47.067 --> 42:50.836
- I didn't want to think of myself as selfish.
- Frank.

42:50.838 --> 42:54.940
As <i>that</i> selfish. Not on top of everything
else I already think about myself.

42:54.942 --> 42:57.242
Copy you.

42:57.244 --> 42:59.845
'Cause it's not like
I have so much to live for.

42:59.847 --> 43:02.016
Yeah, well,
that's true.

43:03.350 --> 43:04.852
Well, anyway, thank you.

43:11.992 --> 43:13.592
What the fuck, Frank?

43:13.594 --> 43:15.227
I'm sorry.
I don't know what that was.

43:15.229 --> 43:17.498
Neither do I,
for fuck's sake. Jesus.

43:21.368 --> 43:23.468
- Goddamn it!
- I'm sorry.

43:23.470 --> 43:26.040
- What is wrong with you?
- I don't know.

43:31.645 --> 43:33.245
What the fuck?

43:33.247 --> 43:34.548
Let's just...
Come on.

43:37.284 --> 43:38.252
Mmm.

43:41.221 --> 43:43.424
Can't... Just put it on...

43:46.126 --> 43:48.093
I'm sorry.

43:48.095 --> 43:51.430
I'm sorry,
it's just very difficult

43:51.432 --> 43:54.333
for me to give myself over to
any sort of positive activity.

43:54.335 --> 43:57.602
Yeah.
Especially this one.

43:57.604 --> 43:59.638
It makes me think about how
long I've gone without it,

43:59.640 --> 44:01.606
which makes me
want to kill myself.

44:01.608 --> 44:04.976
Yeah, well, I've been pretty
sure for a very long time

44:04.978 --> 44:07.446
that life is essentially
a horrible experience,

44:07.448 --> 44:09.414
and I really don't need
this kind of confusion.

44:09.416 --> 44:11.216
- And pressure.
- Yeah.

44:11.218 --> 44:12.384
I mean, if it all sucks,
then fuck it,

44:12.386 --> 44:15.420
but if it doesn't all suck,
then there's so much pressure.

44:15.422 --> 44:17.122
Yeah.

44:17.124 --> 44:19.491
God, do you even know
how long it's been

44:19.493 --> 44:23.161
since I've been touched with
affection by another human being?

44:23.163 --> 44:25.330
How about without affection?

44:25.332 --> 44:27.199
Nearly as long.

44:27.201 --> 44:31.136
I tell you right now, I haven't
felt pleasure since about 2006.

44:31.138 --> 44:33.538
Sometimes, I feel
the absence of pain,

44:33.540 --> 44:36.007
which at this point
feels like pleasure,

44:36.009 --> 44:38.479
or at least pleasure's
little cousin.

44:39.413 --> 44:41.046
I don't have protection.

44:41.048 --> 44:42.180
Well, why would you?

44:42.182 --> 44:44.549
I mean, why would you
have a condom today?

44:44.551 --> 44:47.119
What are the odds?
Astronomical.

44:47.121 --> 44:50.255
- What if you got pregnant?
- I'm sure my womb is hostile.

44:50.257 --> 44:52.991
Having sex right now
would be irresponsible.

44:52.993 --> 44:54.659
Well, who cares?

44:54.661 --> 44:56.997
I mean, how much worse
can things get?

44:58.465 --> 45:00.399
- Okay.
- Yeah?

45:00.401 --> 45:01.502
Okay.

45:13.447 --> 45:15.080
Okay.

45:15.082 --> 45:18.150
Okay.

45:18.152 --> 45:19.719
Okay.

45:19.721 --> 45:22.087
All right.

45:23.457 --> 45:26.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

45:35.636 --> 45:36.570
Okay.

45:40.174 --> 45:41.239
How's that?

45:41.241 --> 45:42.607
That's fine.

45:45.045 --> 45:48.046
Do you think the mountain lion
will be attracted to the musk?

45:48.048 --> 45:50.015
I think it was a puma.

45:51.118 --> 45:52.517
How is it now?

45:52.519 --> 45:56.288
It feels strange
yet pleasantly familiar,

45:56.290 --> 45:59.727
kind of like coming off a long
diet or going back to smoking.

46:01.662 --> 46:03.462
How about now?

46:03.464 --> 46:05.297
Do you have
any diseases?

46:05.299 --> 46:06.631
Of course not.

46:06.633 --> 46:08.633
I missed every
possible sexual revolution.

46:08.635 --> 46:11.269
The first one,
the one after Tinder,

46:11.271 --> 46:13.806
- the one after Caitlyn Jenner...
- Me, too.

46:16.778 --> 46:18.410
Crabs.

46:18.412 --> 46:20.345
You have crabs?

46:20.347 --> 46:21.680
No, actual crabs.

46:21.682 --> 46:23.248
Over there.

46:23.250 --> 46:25.450
Those aren't crabs,
those are tarantulas.

46:25.452 --> 46:26.551
They look like crabs.

46:26.553 --> 46:27.652
No, they don't.

46:27.654 --> 46:30.155
And besides,
they don't attack humans.

46:30.157 --> 46:31.590
Now you're just
making shit up.

46:31.592 --> 46:34.125
Oh, yes, for the thrill
of fucking you.

46:34.127 --> 46:36.394
- Let's get it over with.
- Fine.

46:40.501 --> 46:43.703
My mother used to tell me to always
use two condoms when you have sex.

46:43.705 --> 46:45.437
The second one
always had to be bigger.

46:45.439 --> 46:48.106
- It looked like a wind sock.
- That's so stupid.

46:48.108 --> 46:50.843
Each condom would cause
the other one to break.

46:50.845 --> 46:53.846
A fact discovered, astraddle,
in the summer after 12th grade,

46:53.848 --> 46:57.449
by a nice girl named Auden
who had no quarrel with anyone.

46:57.451 --> 46:59.351
She ran screaming
from our rec room.

46:59.353 --> 47:01.686
Of course, you had sex
in your rec room.

47:01.688 --> 47:03.723
We had a Nutone intercom system.

47:03.725 --> 47:06.258
The master control
was in the kitchen.

47:06.260 --> 47:09.327
My parents could listen and talk to
any room in the house from there.

47:09.329 --> 47:12.297
I used to call the kitchen "The Eagle's Nest."

47:12.299 --> 47:13.733
When my father heard
Auden wailing,

47:13.735 --> 47:16.134
he screamed
through the intercom,

47:16.136 --> 47:18.336
"What the fuck
is going on down there?"

47:18.338 --> 47:19.371
I said what happened.

47:19.373 --> 47:20.873
There was a pause,

47:20.875 --> 47:23.575
and then my mother said,
"Dinner's ready."

47:23.577 --> 47:25.477
Your mother cooked?

47:25.479 --> 47:27.345
On the off-chance
that we are making a baby,

47:27.347 --> 47:28.613
do you want a boy
or a girl?

47:28.615 --> 47:30.649
You're asking me this now?

47:30.651 --> 47:32.752
I'm killing time.

47:32.754 --> 47:35.253
Uh, a boy.

47:35.255 --> 47:38.189
My mother actually told
me there's a way to get a boy.

47:38.191 --> 47:40.258
- Oh, this ought to be good.
- Yeah.

47:40.260 --> 47:44.496
At the moment of climax, just
shout out, "Oh, boy! Oh, boy!"

47:44.498 --> 47:47.232
Can we please stop
talking about your mother.

47:47.234 --> 47:49.367
But I don't know why
you'd possibly want a boy,

47:49.369 --> 47:50.803
considering, you know,

47:50.805 --> 47:53.638
the baseline quality of
your relationships with men.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.640
Oh. What, revenge?

47:57.912 --> 48:00.345
Oh, Jesus, Frank!

48:00.347 --> 48:03.281
Jesus effing Christ!

48:05.820 --> 48:08.486
Oh, God, you look like
you're gonna throw up!

48:08.488 --> 48:10.522
Why would I?
You're a very attractive woman.

48:10.524 --> 48:12.357
Not from that.

48:12.359 --> 48:13.592
Oh, right,
sorry.

48:13.594 --> 48:14.894
Oh, God!

48:14.896 --> 48:17.295
No!
No, no, no, no!

48:17.297 --> 48:19.164
- No?
- No, not "no."

48:19.166 --> 48:20.599
I'm just
a very negative person.

48:20.601 --> 48:21.734
Okay.

48:21.736 --> 48:23.736
I'm expressing
incredulity!

48:23.738 --> 48:25.537
Got it.

48:25.539 --> 48:26.939
- No!
- Ah!

48:26.941 --> 48:29.541
No! No! No!
No! No!

48:29.543 --> 48:31.643
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!

48:31.645 --> 48:33.378
Oh, boy!

48:33.380 --> 48:37.349
Yeah!
Oh, boy!

48:43.557 --> 48:45.357
Anytime, pal.

48:45.359 --> 48:46.691
Can you not talk right now?

48:46.693 --> 48:48.193
Fine.

48:48.195 --> 48:50.662
- It's gonna get cold out.
- No, it won't.

48:50.664 --> 48:52.932
Yes, it will.
It's the Paso Robles Diurnal.

48:52.934 --> 48:55.634
There's
sweeping wind temperatures.

48:55.636 --> 48:57.569
Don't you know anything
about meteorology?

48:57.571 --> 48:59.604
No!

48:59.606 --> 49:01.874
Oh, God. Kelp.

49:01.876 --> 49:03.809
- Help?
- No, kelp.

49:03.811 --> 49:06.411
There's kelp at
or near my vagina.

49:06.413 --> 49:08.781
Oh, that's grass.
We're in grass.

49:08.783 --> 49:10.348
How is that better?

49:10.350 --> 49:12.350
You put the ocean in my head
with the fucking crabs.

49:41.348 --> 49:42.580
What?

49:42.582 --> 49:44.251
I had a purse.

49:49.991 --> 49:51.924
Do you want a drink?

49:51.926 --> 49:54.960
I want all the drinks poured
directly down my gullet.

49:54.962 --> 49:57.930
Why don't we go to your room
and crack open your minibar?

49:57.932 --> 49:59.431
Why don't we
go to your room

49:59.433 --> 50:01.901
and crack open
your goddamn minibar?

50:01.903 --> 50:04.502
Frank.
We're alive.

50:04.504 --> 50:06.406
What does that have
to do with anything?

50:29.496 --> 50:31.663
- How do you know the words to this?
- Come on.

50:41.675 --> 50:44.977
What?

50:46.914 --> 50:48.546
<i>But at some point,</i>

50:48.548 --> 50:50.983
<i>don't you think it just starts
to look a little ridiculous?</i>

50:50.985 --> 50:54.385
<i>Think about it, this guy was formally
the head of the committee...</i>

50:54.387 --> 50:56.621
"Formerly," not "form-ally."

50:56.623 --> 50:58.258
I know, it's appalling.

50:59.626 --> 51:01.693
Seriously, the chocolate?

51:01.695 --> 51:04.897
We're not going to drink without eating.
Alcoholics do that.

51:04.899 --> 51:06.766
The chocolate
is the most expensive thing

51:06.768 --> 51:08.100
in the minibar
besides the...

51:08.102 --> 51:10.401
wine.

51:10.403 --> 51:12.437
Would you rather we had
ordered room service?

51:12.439 --> 51:13.739
Definitely not.

51:13.741 --> 51:15.741
I spoke to the front desk.

51:15.743 --> 51:18.576
They add a delivery fee,
a 17 percent gratuity,

51:18.578 --> 51:21.513
and some sort of fuckin' cover
charge, like we're in Italy.

51:21.515 --> 51:25.050
I've always wondered why
they give you two glasses

51:25.052 --> 51:26.852
even when
you're traveling alone.

51:26.854 --> 51:29.587
Because one
would be so sad.

51:29.589 --> 51:31.023
Here's to...
What?

51:31.025 --> 51:32.626
Please.

51:46.741 --> 51:49.041
It's not hashish.

51:49.043 --> 51:51.676
I'm not wearing anything
under my pajamas.

51:51.678 --> 51:53.478
Why would you?
They're so alluring.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.514
I didn't think I was gonna
be intimate this weekend.

51:56.516 --> 51:57.883
Or any weekend.

51:57.885 --> 52:00.085
Superman couldn't see
through those pajamas.

52:00.087 --> 52:01.452
So you tried.

52:01.454 --> 52:04.056
People have jousted
in lighter clothing.

52:04.058 --> 52:06.091
- Frank?
- Present.

52:06.093 --> 52:09.028
When you said before that
I was an attractive woman,

52:09.030 --> 52:10.662
what did you mean?

52:10.664 --> 52:12.397
What do you mean
what did I mean?

52:12.399 --> 52:14.432
You're an attractive woman.
You're physically appealing.

52:14.434 --> 52:15.837
Can you be more specific?

52:17.537 --> 52:20.840
Your facial features
subscribe to the Golden Ratio.

52:20.842 --> 52:22.507
What?

52:22.509 --> 52:25.510
One to the quantity one half
times radical five plus one.

52:25.512 --> 52:26.879
The Golden Ratio.

52:26.881 --> 52:28.446
You can tell that?

52:28.448 --> 52:30.049
It's an estimate.

52:30.051 --> 52:32.483
And you have
The Folds of Aphrodite.

52:32.485 --> 52:34.686
What are the Folds
of Aphrodite?

52:34.688 --> 52:36.688
That's the name of the
particular, graceful way

52:36.690 --> 52:38.057
that the cheeks
of beautiful women

52:38.059 --> 52:40.692
arrange themselves
when they smile.

52:40.694 --> 52:44.096
There's a gentle creasing
that begins at the cheekbone

52:44.098 --> 52:46.999
and runs downward,
in a slightly arced diagonal,

52:47.001 --> 52:50.202
directing the eye
to the mouth.

52:50.204 --> 52:52.439
It's aesthetically thrilling.

52:54.608 --> 52:58.110
Well...
I've never heard the term

52:58.112 --> 52:59.945
"Folds of Aphrodite."

52:59.947 --> 53:01.714
I coined it.

53:01.716 --> 53:03.648
Then it's not a real thing.

53:03.650 --> 53:06.118
Then it and you
are bullshit.

53:06.120 --> 53:08.854
I googled around and there was
no name for it so I coined it.

53:08.856 --> 53:11.724
- It's established now.
- Bullshit.

53:11.726 --> 53:15.227
In my experience, there's at least a 90
percent correlation between beautiful women

53:15.229 --> 53:17.930
- and women who have The Folds of Aphrodite.
- Oh...

53:17.932 --> 53:20.866
The Folds cut across races
and ethnicities.

53:20.868 --> 53:22.469
What else about me?

53:23.536 --> 53:24.803
Well...

53:28.943 --> 53:30.709
you're slender,

53:30.711 --> 53:33.478
but not to the point of a
troubled relationship with food.

53:33.480 --> 53:35.613
That's actionable profiling,
right there.

53:35.615 --> 53:37.615
File a grievance.

53:37.617 --> 53:41.053
And your curves are very
sexy but not vulgar.

53:41.055 --> 53:43.055
Everything very much
in proportion,

53:43.057 --> 53:45.224
firm but not overly,

53:45.226 --> 53:48.593
which I've always found
weird and prepossessing.

53:48.595 --> 53:51.764
Your arms bespeak physical
fitness and athleticism,

53:51.766 --> 53:53.564
but nothing sapphic.

53:53.566 --> 53:56.702
And your ankles quietly aver

53:56.704 --> 53:59.772
that you will keep your body
well into later age.

53:59.774 --> 54:02.875
It's despicable
the way men look at women.

54:02.877 --> 54:07.647
In short, you are beautiful,
graceful, and elegant.

54:09.150 --> 54:12.718
Also, you don't dress
in an overtly sexy way.

54:12.720 --> 54:14.887
You seem to understand
that dressing sexy

54:14.889 --> 54:17.689
is actually the opposite
of being sexy,

54:17.691 --> 54:19.925
that certain information
should have to be earned,

54:19.927 --> 54:21.794
rather than given away
for free

54:21.796 --> 54:24.696
to anyone and everyone
who passeth by your doorstep.

54:24.698 --> 54:26.865
If this were 1732.

54:26.867 --> 54:28.233
I'm giving you
a compliment.

54:28.235 --> 54:29.735
You're calling me
a prude.

54:29.737 --> 54:31.870
I'm suggesting that
you've taken the high road.

54:31.872 --> 54:34.039
Even in this flagrant,
flaunting day and age,

54:34.041 --> 54:36.275
you have chosen
to preserve the mystery.

54:36.277 --> 54:40.982
Yes, the pajamas go too far,
but I applaud the ethos.

54:43.084 --> 54:45.583
- Would you like to know about you?
- No.

54:45.585 --> 54:46.821
Yes, you would.

54:48.789 --> 54:50.723
You're very handsome.

54:50.725 --> 54:53.726
You have powerful eyes.

54:53.728 --> 54:56.729
Your hair
will never be a problem.

54:56.731 --> 54:59.832
The corners
of your mouth touch

54:59.834 --> 55:04.236
but do not cross the vertical
lines which bisect your eyes.

55:04.238 --> 55:07.605
In profile, your chin extends
exactly the same as your lower lip,

55:07.607 --> 55:09.574
which is an ideal.

55:09.576 --> 55:14.612
Bodily, you feel strong and
substantial, sinuous but not wiry.

55:14.614 --> 55:16.348
Sartorially,
you get high marks.

55:16.350 --> 55:18.083
You tuck in your shirts
because you realize

55:18.085 --> 55:21.120
that tails out is
a ridiculous way to dress.

55:21.122 --> 55:24.023
You wear your pants low, and
your shoes are legitimate.

55:24.025 --> 55:28.093
And you have
a beautiful penis.

55:28.095 --> 55:29.795
I do?

55:29.797 --> 55:31.263
Oh, come on, Frank.

55:31.265 --> 55:34.135
Surely people have told you
that your entire life.

55:35.302 --> 55:36.702
No.

55:36.704 --> 55:39.038
Well, it's very nice.

55:39.040 --> 55:40.706
It's straight,

55:40.708 --> 55:43.242
and you would not believe how
epidemic a problem that is.

55:43.244 --> 55:47.046
Also,
it's balletically formed.

55:47.048 --> 55:52.351
It's not so big as to ever
be a cause for concern,

55:52.353 --> 55:56.055
but it's big enough never to be
the object of ridicule or scorn.

55:56.057 --> 55:59.058
You're in
a very sweet spot there.

55:59.060 --> 56:01.894
Are you saying that Keith's
penis is not straight?

56:01.896 --> 56:05.696
Can you imagine that we would
have gone this entire weekend

56:05.698 --> 56:08.100
without saying these
things to each other?

56:08.102 --> 56:10.769
- "Balletically formed"?
- That's right.

56:10.771 --> 56:14.273
People are
ridiculous and pathetic.

56:14.275 --> 56:17.342
Animals, that's all.

56:17.344 --> 56:21.180
We want to believe that there's some
high-minded, cosmic meaning behind love,

56:21.182 --> 56:22.881
but the truth is
we're drawn to,

56:22.883 --> 56:24.817
and make most of our
decisions based upon,

56:24.819 --> 56:29.054
shapes we find appealing,
and colors and textures

56:29.056 --> 56:32.724
and smells and tastes
and spatial relations.

56:32.726 --> 56:35.127
It's so stupid.

56:35.129 --> 56:37.329
This is pretty good.

56:37.331 --> 56:39.398
I mean, when I think about
what people look like

56:39.400 --> 56:43.035
when they kiss or have sex,
I want to vomit.

56:43.037 --> 56:44.937
You almost did vomit.

56:44.939 --> 56:48.707
I mean, there's nothing beautiful
or transcendent about being human.

56:48.709 --> 56:51.210
Ultimately,
it's just a filthy business

56:51.212 --> 56:54.913
of a revolting species
trying to survive.

56:54.915 --> 56:57.749
I mean, if you've ever really
watched another person eat,

56:57.751 --> 56:59.885
or seen yourself in a mirror
taking a shit,

56:59.887 --> 57:02.754
or walked through
South Coast Plaza,

57:02.756 --> 57:04.756
you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

57:04.758 --> 57:07.392
But I had my eyes open
when I was fucking you,

57:07.394 --> 57:09.294
and I thought we must
have looked pretty good.

57:09.296 --> 57:12.231
My father thought
he had a good golf swing.

57:13.434 --> 57:14.735
Wait.

57:17.471 --> 57:20.172
Do a groove chew.

57:20.174 --> 57:22.007
I'm sorry?

57:22.009 --> 57:24.009
It's a style
of chewing used

57:24.011 --> 57:25.811
when you're really
enjoying something

57:25.813 --> 57:27.880
that you don't have
very often.

57:27.882 --> 57:29.383
Like this.

57:31.886 --> 57:32.887
Mm!

57:34.321 --> 57:35.256
Mm!

57:38.159 --> 57:40.392
- This is a thing?
- I coined it.

57:40.394 --> 57:42.761
And you're not embarrassed?

57:42.763 --> 57:44.398
All right, just come on.
Just try.

57:47.902 --> 57:49.234
- Mmm...
- Mm.

57:49.236 --> 57:51.739
- Mmm!
- Mmm-mm!

57:58.445 --> 58:00.913
- Can you groove swallow?
- You can.

58:00.915 --> 58:03.017
- Can we groove swallow now?
- Okay, fine.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.202
- Huh?
- Uh...

58:27.441 --> 58:29.777
<i>I remember the
first time I ever saw you.</i>

58:30.945 --> 58:32.477
<i>It was a partial nephrectomy.</i>

58:32.479 --> 58:35.883
<i>You were standing in for Dr.
Sumner who had an emergency.</i>

58:37.384 --> 58:39.117
<i>With your cap and mask,</i>

58:39.119 --> 58:41.188
<i>all I could see
were your eyes.</i>

58:42.823 --> 58:44.325
<i>And I remember thinking...</i>

58:45.292 --> 58:46.794
<i>thank God.</i>

58:49.129 --> 58:51.863
<i>Because anything more
would be too much to bear.</i>

58:51.865 --> 58:53.799
Stop worrying
about fucking each other

58:53.801 --> 58:56.368
and start saving the people
who are dying in your hospital.

58:56.370 --> 58:59.371
Your patient has a
snake in his urethra.

58:59.373 --> 59:01.406
You should all
lose your licenses.

59:01.408 --> 59:04.843
When my time comes,
I will sign a DNR.

59:04.845 --> 59:07.312
I won't.
I want to be resuscitated.

59:07.314 --> 59:10.415
I want to be intubated, revived,
retrieved, and prolonged.

59:10.417 --> 59:11.883
I want them
to zap me with clappers

59:11.885 --> 59:15.454
and inject my heart with that long needle
of adrenaline... whatever it takes.

59:15.456 --> 59:17.489
What? But, what if
there's no hope?

59:17.491 --> 59:18.957
There's already no hope.

59:18.959 --> 59:21.526
But what if you're just
a burden to your family

59:21.528 --> 59:24.196
and, by extension, the
entire health-care system?

59:24.198 --> 59:25.397
Won't give a shit.

59:25.399 --> 59:27.366
I want them
to stave off death.

59:27.368 --> 59:30.035
I don't care if there's turnips
with better brain-wave patterns.

59:30.037 --> 59:31.270
Legumes.

59:31.272 --> 59:33.138
But I thought
you hated life.

59:33.140 --> 59:35.340
I do, but I'm going to
be dead for a long time,

59:35.342 --> 59:37.276
so there's no rush.

59:37.278 --> 59:38.577
Do you want
to have children?

59:38.579 --> 59:40.112
I'd rather be dead
in a ditch.

59:40.114 --> 59:42.080
Oh.

59:42.082 --> 59:44.449
I mean, why would I do
that to those poor souls?

59:44.451 --> 59:47.085
Well, for the same reason
you want to be resuscitated.

59:47.087 --> 59:50.956
Because being, as bad as it
is, is better than not being.

59:50.958 --> 59:53.091
This is a horrible place
to be.

59:53.093 --> 59:55.360
Central California,
or the whole thing?

59:55.362 --> 59:58.030
I'm already alive.
I already know shit.

59:58.032 --> 59:59.998
But unborn children
are none the wiser

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.933
and deserve to be protected
from certain things,

01:00:01.935 --> 01:00:03.402
like being alive
in the first place.

01:00:03.404 --> 01:00:05.170
That makes no sense.

01:00:05.172 --> 01:00:07.339
Living was not my choice.
It was my mother's.

01:00:07.341 --> 01:00:09.374
Have you ever heard
of anything more selfish?

01:00:09.376 --> 01:00:12.077
- I hope I'm not pregnant.
- That's all I'm saying.

01:00:12.079 --> 01:00:14.179
Why did your father
leave your mother?

01:00:14.181 --> 01:00:15.347
Because he could.

01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:17.482
Because he had the power
of locomotion.

01:00:17.484 --> 01:00:21.353
Why did she keep and hyphenate
both her divorced last names?

01:00:21.355 --> 01:00:23.955
Because she thought
it made her sound aristocratic.

01:00:23.957 --> 01:00:25.557
Also, this way
she gets all her mail.

01:00:25.559 --> 01:00:29.528
And what would you say
is the major barrier

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:32.130
to a warm relationship between
you and your half-brother?

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:34.900
He's a douchebag. Why are you
asking me these questions?

01:00:34.902 --> 01:00:37.035
Just... I don't know.

01:00:37.037 --> 01:00:41.073
I'm just evaluating your qualifications
as an ongoing love interest.

01:00:41.075 --> 01:00:42.941
Not that
I'm advocating that.

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.544
Clearly, you're an emotional
cripple, as am I.

01:00:45.546 --> 01:00:50.315
I don't have any qualifications as an
ongoing love interest and neither do you.

01:00:50.317 --> 01:00:52.417
But love interest
is too strong a word.

01:00:52.419 --> 01:00:54.353
I, um... Affection.

01:00:54.355 --> 01:00:55.987
Interest.
Tolerance interest.

01:00:55.989 --> 01:00:57.989
This isn't
going to be ongoing.

01:00:57.991 --> 01:01:00.158
What, you've just decided
that unilaterally?

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.561
- For both our sakes.
- I don't get a say?

01:01:02.563 --> 01:01:05.230
No, you have terrible judgment
in this regard.

01:01:05.232 --> 01:01:08.300
What, but... I...

01:01:08.302 --> 01:01:12.037
My head is finally
clear, thanks to you.

01:01:12.039 --> 01:01:14.639
I mean, I haven't thought about
Keith since the mountain lion.

01:01:14.641 --> 01:01:17.275
So you admit
it was a mountain lion.

01:01:17.277 --> 01:01:20.145
Do you have any idea
how huge this is for me?

01:01:20.147 --> 01:01:22.047
If it's true,
the mountain lion and I

01:01:22.049 --> 01:01:24.449
are happy to have
performed that service.

01:01:24.451 --> 01:01:28.053
But now, apparently, no
good deed goes unpunished.

01:01:28.055 --> 01:01:30.188
I think
I finally have closure.

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:32.424
I don't trust that statement
and neither should you.

01:01:32.426 --> 01:01:34.059
But you want to.

01:01:34.061 --> 01:01:36.294
You don't just jump from one
love object to another.

01:01:36.296 --> 01:01:38.196
- Tolerance object.
- That's how mistakes are made.

01:01:38.198 --> 01:01:39.965
All I make are mistakes.

01:01:39.967 --> 01:01:41.433
At least this one
would be fun.

01:01:41.435 --> 01:01:43.101
Are you having fun
right now?

01:01:43.103 --> 01:01:46.407
Yes. I mean, we're kind of
arguing, but there's hope.

01:01:47.508 --> 01:01:49.341
This is an interlude.

01:01:49.343 --> 01:01:51.042
A weekend.

01:01:51.044 --> 01:01:53.612
A small oasis of time
in which we can taste intimacy

01:01:53.614 --> 01:01:57.015
like it's a piece of free
salami at Trader Joe's.

01:01:57.017 --> 01:02:00.185
Why not? You're in the store anyway,
and you forgot to eat breakfast,

01:02:00.187 --> 01:02:03.555
and it tastes okay, and afterwards
there's no salami fallout.

01:02:03.557 --> 01:02:07.058
When no one's looking, you just
drop the toothpick onto the floor.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.762
Man, you're not one of the...
Do you do that?

01:02:09.764 --> 01:02:11.630
Well, there's no garbage
pails in that place,

01:02:11.632 --> 01:02:14.734
and it's unsanitary to put the
toothpick on the receptacle napkin.

01:02:14.736 --> 01:02:16.601
All right,
le... just... Okay.

01:02:16.603 --> 01:02:18.170
Just... I'm just
devil's advocate.

01:02:18.172 --> 01:02:20.272
Maybe...

01:02:20.274 --> 01:02:22.007
just what if, okay?

01:02:22.009 --> 01:02:23.608
What if it's more?

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:26.578
What if there actually
is something to the idea

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.447
of a destination wedding?

01:02:28.449 --> 01:02:32.083
What if we've been thinking about
this whole thing backwards?

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:34.252
What if...

01:02:34.254 --> 01:02:39.057
I know, but what if our real
destination was each other?

01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:41.228
What if you
never say that again?

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:46.231
What if happiness
is... contagious?

01:02:46.233 --> 01:02:47.666
Why would you think
that meeting someone

01:02:47.668 --> 01:02:49.501
has anything to do
with being happy?

01:02:49.503 --> 01:02:51.036
Because!

01:02:51.038 --> 01:02:52.637
Once upon a time,
I met someone,

01:02:52.639 --> 01:02:54.807
and I was happy...
I thought.

01:02:54.809 --> 01:02:57.142
Personally, I'd be worried
if my life philosophy

01:02:57.144 --> 01:02:58.778
began with
"Once Upon a Time."

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.780
Well, I was raised
by optimists.

01:03:00.782 --> 01:03:02.815
But you have a preponderance
of counter-evidence.

01:03:02.817 --> 01:03:04.649
Were you not watching
your own engagement?

01:03:04.651 --> 01:03:06.752
- How could I have been?
- What's wrong with you?

01:03:06.754 --> 01:03:09.421
Nothing. Sometimes I just
willfully reject irony.

01:03:09.423 --> 01:03:10.790
You are doomed.

01:03:10.792 --> 01:03:13.425
Maybe we saved
each other, Frank.

01:03:13.427 --> 01:03:15.627
I mean, did you ever
think about it like that?

01:03:15.629 --> 01:03:18.296
No. Neither should you.

01:03:18.298 --> 01:03:21.132
I wonder how many
people met at weddings

01:03:21.134 --> 01:03:23.535
- and then went on to...
- Thirty-two.

01:03:23.537 --> 01:03:26.438
Why not, you know,
extend the oasis?

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.774
A good day here,
a good day there,

01:03:28.776 --> 01:03:32.110
pretty soon you're just talking
about a couple of good days.

01:03:32.112 --> 01:03:34.112
What time does our flight
land tomorrow night?

01:03:34.114 --> 01:03:35.715
I don't know,
about 7:30?

01:03:35.717 --> 01:03:39.084
I will extend it until
tomorrow at about 7:30.

01:03:39.086 --> 01:03:42.521
Well, there's no point in
extending it another four seconds

01:03:42.523 --> 01:03:45.423
if you're not gonna keep your
mind open to the possibilities.

01:03:45.425 --> 01:03:47.559
Why do people need the
dangled carrot of a future?

01:03:47.561 --> 01:03:48.761
Because we do.

01:03:48.763 --> 01:03:50.730
Because connection
is precious,

01:03:50.732 --> 01:03:53.331
therefore, it is immoral

01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:56.201
to just treat each other
like dalliances,

01:03:56.203 --> 01:03:58.537
even if that's what
we wind up being.

01:03:58.539 --> 01:04:00.505
But that's exactly what
we wind up being.

01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:03.141
Permanence is a myth,
an a... an illusion.

01:04:03.143 --> 01:04:05.243
Well, I didn't say anything
about permanence.

01:04:05.245 --> 01:04:09.114
I was speaking of a slightly
lengthier temporariness.

01:04:09.116 --> 01:04:10.282
What's the point?

01:04:10.284 --> 01:04:12.250
I just told you
what the point was.

01:04:12.252 --> 01:04:15.353
But when it's over, you're
right back at square zero.

01:04:15.355 --> 01:04:17.389
I will not
keep my mind open.

01:04:17.391 --> 01:04:19.357
Well, then
just keep it open

01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:21.727
to the possibility
of keeping it open.

01:04:21.729 --> 01:04:22.663
No.

01:04:24.197 --> 01:04:25.664
Really?

01:04:25.666 --> 01:04:30.335
Oh, wow. That's... I...
I'm almost, I'm almost...

01:04:30.337 --> 01:04:32.304
You know what,
if you can't or won't,

01:04:32.306 --> 01:04:34.639
then you simply
can't or won't.

01:04:34.641 --> 01:04:36.608
- That's my blanket.
- "That's my blanket."

01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:38.476
You might want to shake out
the Pringle fragments.

01:04:38.478 --> 01:04:40.178
"You might want to shake out
the Pringle fragments."

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.379
If you want to leave,
just say so.

01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:43.481
- I very much want to leave.
- Say it again.

01:04:43.483 --> 01:04:45.417
You debate like a child.

01:04:45.419 --> 01:04:47.419
You eat like a raccoon.

01:04:47.421 --> 01:04:48.823
You're fucking up.

01:04:53.761 --> 01:04:55.527
How about
if I keep my mind open

01:04:55.529 --> 01:04:57.562
to the possibility
of keeping my mind open

01:04:57.564 --> 01:05:00.267
to the possibility
of keeping my mind open?

01:05:01.535 --> 01:05:04.770
That is just one metalevel
too removed.

01:05:04.772 --> 01:05:06.706
Come on.

01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:08.175
Get back into bed.

01:05:09.676 --> 01:05:12.212
Let's find out who the
nephrologist is sleeping with.

01:05:13.715 --> 01:05:15.647
Fine.

01:05:15.649 --> 01:05:18.183
But only until
the next commercial break.

01:05:18.185 --> 01:05:20.720
And with no sexual reprise.

01:05:20.722 --> 01:05:25.725
And only because I <i>do</i> want to know who
the nephrologist is sleeping with.

01:05:25.727 --> 01:05:27.258
Okay.

01:05:30.631 --> 01:05:34.834
<i>When I look at
you, I don't see smallpox.</i>

01:05:34.836 --> 01:05:36.234
And it's "re-prize."

01:05:36.236 --> 01:05:37.402
It's "re-preeze."

01:05:37.404 --> 01:05:40.207
- "Re-prize."
- It's... "re-preeze."

01:07:10.064 --> 01:07:11.864
Jesus,
is it Kristallnacht?

01:07:11.866 --> 01:07:13.431
Oh, it's housekeeping.

01:07:13.433 --> 01:07:15.433
They're not going to
get that reference.

01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:18.470
<i>Mas retardos!</i>

01:07:18.472 --> 01:07:22.509
Ah...

01:07:23.745 --> 01:07:27.947
Oh... You shouldn't be in here.

01:07:27.949 --> 01:07:29.581
This is my room.

01:07:29.583 --> 01:07:31.016
Then I shouldn't be
in here.

01:07:31.018 --> 01:07:33.651
Okay.

01:07:33.653 --> 01:07:35.721
How did I wind up
in this position?

01:07:35.723 --> 01:07:37.522
You made some
poor life choices.

01:07:37.524 --> 01:07:40.325
No, in this position.
I'm half off the bed.

01:07:40.327 --> 01:07:42.728
Why is my nose bleeding?

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.563
I think I have a spinal injury.

01:07:45.565 --> 01:07:47.465
You feel pregnant?

01:07:47.467 --> 01:07:48.734
I wouldn't know.

01:07:48.736 --> 01:07:50.468
What's your gut say?

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:51.904
What it always says.

01:07:51.906 --> 01:07:53.839
"Don't listen to me."

01:07:53.841 --> 01:07:55.875
But if you did listen?

01:07:55.877 --> 01:07:58.476
I don't feel any different,
if that's what you mean.

01:07:58.478 --> 01:08:01.346
- Good.
- How is that good?

01:08:01.348 --> 01:08:05.050
Why would you want me to perpetuate
my general circumstances?

01:08:05.052 --> 01:08:07.086
You can do anything you want
with your circumstances.

01:08:07.088 --> 01:08:08.921
I was thinking
of my circumstances.

01:08:08.923 --> 01:08:10.823
Which are so wonderful.

01:08:10.825 --> 01:08:12.590
We shouldn't have spent
the night together.

01:08:12.592 --> 01:08:13.893
You wouldn't let me leave.

01:08:13.895 --> 01:08:15.895
I didn't want it to end
on a bad note.

01:08:15.897 --> 01:08:17.129
Also,
you're in the next room.

01:08:17.131 --> 01:08:19.031
It would have been
spectacularly awkward.

01:08:19.033 --> 01:08:20.500
As opposed to this.

01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:25.037
We tried, okay?
We did.

01:08:25.038 --> 01:08:28.606
But at some point there's just not
enough optimism left inside a person

01:08:28.608 --> 01:08:31.475
to sustain something
like this, you know?

01:08:31.478 --> 01:08:33.946
You broken preacher,
me broken choir.

01:08:33.948 --> 01:08:36.613
I think it's important we recognize
that and verbalize it openly,

01:08:36.616 --> 01:08:38.649
so as to avoid
any discomfort.

01:08:38.652 --> 01:08:41.486
Oh. Mission accomplished.

01:08:41.488 --> 01:08:42.756
Good.

01:08:47.895 --> 01:08:50.428
Do you have everything?

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:53.064
Oh, um... Yeah.

01:08:53.067 --> 01:08:56.035
I think, uh, my...

01:08:56.037 --> 01:08:58.670
Can we still hang together
at the farewell brunch?

01:08:58.671 --> 01:09:00.470
Uh, who else
am I gonna hang with?

01:09:00.473 --> 01:09:02.607
Although I suppose
I could hang with myself.

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:07.011
Well, I'm going to shove some tissues
up my nostrils and take a shower.

01:09:07.014 --> 01:09:09.050
Sounds like
good-bye to me.

01:09:25.166 --> 01:09:28.067
Well, what do you think, about
time we head to the airport?

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:29.533
It's really close.

01:09:29.536 --> 01:09:30.903
Fifteen minutes.

01:09:30.904 --> 01:09:33.872
- Well, our flight's not for...
- Five hours.

01:09:33.875 --> 01:09:36.075
- There could be traffic.
- Why take chances?

01:09:36.077 --> 01:09:37.912
Then we should just
say our good-byes.

01:09:39.714 --> 01:09:40.848
Good-bye.

01:09:44.886 --> 01:09:46.551
Want your farewell gift?

01:09:46.553 --> 01:09:49.156
The farewell is my gift,
but please, take mine.

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.673
Who was San Luis Obispo,
anyway?

01:10:08.675 --> 01:10:11.076
And what the fuck did he do
to become a saint?

01:10:11.078 --> 01:10:13.879
Thirteenth Century Bishop
of Toulouse.

01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:17.615
Served the poor, left the
Church, and died of typhus.

01:10:17.617 --> 01:10:19.218
That's all it takes?

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.853
It was in
the welcome basket.

01:10:20.855 --> 01:10:23.588
Why would you canonize a guy
who left the Church?

01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:26.825
Why look to France when you're
naming a city in California?

01:10:26.827 --> 01:10:28.994
And what the fuck happened
with the urban planning here?

01:10:28.996 --> 01:10:31.830
- At some point, did they just give up?
- Right.

01:10:31.832 --> 01:10:34.666
On the off, off chance
that I ever have a wedding,

01:10:34.668 --> 01:10:38.103
I would never make
anyone travel to it.

01:10:38.105 --> 01:10:40.174
I don't think you'll have
to worry about that.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.182
Because you're
a decent person.

01:10:50.051 --> 01:10:52.184
Not because
you won't get married.

01:10:52.186 --> 01:10:53.553
Oh, come on.

01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:08.668
Why do we live, Frank?

01:11:09.303 --> 01:11:11.536
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:11:11.538 --> 01:11:13.772
I'm serious.

01:11:13.774 --> 01:11:16.641
The work we do isn't
meaningful in any great sense.

01:11:16.643 --> 01:11:19.610
The connections we make
invariably fall to ruin.

01:11:19.612 --> 01:11:22.247
Everything we build
burns to the ground.

01:11:22.249 --> 01:11:25.784
Meaning is a myth, like you've
said, so why do we live?

01:11:25.786 --> 01:11:28.721
I was so enjoying
the silence.

01:11:28.723 --> 01:11:33.092
It has to be that the myth
isn't a myth for everyone.

01:11:33.094 --> 01:11:36.161
Well, it's certainly a myth
for those two. Look at them.

01:11:36.163 --> 01:11:38.998
They'd rather burst into flames
than to fuck each other.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.967
- You don't know that.
- Oh, yes, I do.

01:11:41.969 --> 01:11:47.672
It's possible that within the
myth, there's a sliver of truth,

01:11:47.674 --> 01:11:50.342
and you have to believe
in that sliver wholeheartedly,

01:11:50.344 --> 01:11:53.678
come what may,
despite the rational mind,

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:57.216
because if you...
if you don't,

01:11:57.218 --> 01:12:00.019
the myth just reveals
itself to be a myth,

01:12:00.021 --> 01:12:03.756
and meaninglessness becomes
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

01:12:03.758 --> 01:12:08.827
Try as I might, I cannot get
behind wine in screw-top bottles.

01:12:08.829 --> 01:12:12.663
Also, you have to encourage
others to believe in the myth.

01:12:12.665 --> 01:12:14.867
Because if they believe,
they can do anything.

01:12:14.869 --> 01:12:17.970
They can laugh,
cry, hope,

01:12:17.972 --> 01:12:20.172
vote, get married.

01:12:20.174 --> 01:12:23.142
But if they don't, they can't
do anything, I mean not really,

01:12:23.144 --> 01:12:27.780
except make themselves as shallowly
happy and comfortable as possible.

01:12:27.782 --> 01:12:31.016
Which is just vanity,
let's face it.

01:12:31.018 --> 01:12:34.019
For me,
wine in a screw-top

01:12:34.021 --> 01:12:36.924
will always carry the
stench of chintziness.

01:12:38.926 --> 01:12:42.261
What if we're
falling in love?

01:12:42.263 --> 01:12:45.097
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not a big fan of cork.

01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:47.399
You ever see it on a wall or
in the heels of an espadrille?

01:12:47.401 --> 01:12:48.901
Ridiculous.

01:12:48.903 --> 01:12:52.938
But for wine, it conveys
a certain necessary élan.

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:55.040
What if love
comes for everyone?

01:12:55.042 --> 01:12:57.109
Don't be absurd.

01:12:57.111 --> 01:13:00.712
What if no one is immune,
not even us?

01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:01.782
Stop it.

01:13:04.018 --> 01:13:06.952
It would be remiss
not to embrace the miracle.

01:13:06.954 --> 01:13:09.221
What happened between us
was not a miracle.

01:13:09.223 --> 01:13:11.256
It was actually much closer
to a debacle.

01:13:11.258 --> 01:13:13.325
- Maybe that's what you meant.
- Oh, come on.

01:13:13.327 --> 01:13:15.060
You don't find it miraculous

01:13:15.062 --> 01:13:17.963
that two people like us
forged any kind of bond?

01:13:17.965 --> 01:13:20.766
I find it "debaculous."

01:13:20.768 --> 01:13:22.434
It was a miracle.

01:13:22.436 --> 01:13:25.204
It required forever
being seated together.

01:13:25.206 --> 01:13:28.774
It required an adjoining door
and a near-death experience.

01:13:28.776 --> 01:13:30.409
What are you waiting for,
a burning bush?

01:13:30.411 --> 01:13:33.145
I can't believe you're
bringing this up again.

01:13:33.147 --> 01:13:34.913
I thought we had
an understanding.

01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:37.216
We had come
to an agreement.

01:13:37.218 --> 01:13:39.952
We're less than an hour away
from parting as friends.

01:13:39.954 --> 01:13:41.720
Okay, but deep down,

01:13:41.722 --> 01:13:44.689
in your broken,
miserable gut,

01:13:44.691 --> 01:13:47.893
don't you want something
that's pure

01:13:47.895 --> 01:13:50.362
and in its own grotesque
way, beautiful?

01:13:50.364 --> 01:13:52.331
No.

01:13:52.333 --> 01:13:56.068
Don't you want to secretly
have a romantic life

01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:59.304
that confirms your hopes
instead of your cynicism?

01:13:59.306 --> 01:14:00.839
No.

01:14:00.841 --> 01:14:02.841
Don't you want to believe
that things like this

01:14:02.843 --> 01:14:04.209
actually do happen?

01:14:04.211 --> 01:14:06.178
Nope. I'm fond
of my cynicism.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.380
It's very comfortable.

01:14:08.382 --> 01:14:10.916
- Like a warm blanket of your own shit.
- Yes. Yes.

01:14:10.918 --> 01:14:12.885
I'm very comfortable
and warm

01:14:12.887 --> 01:14:15.389
in my fucking warm blanket
of fucking shit.

01:14:19.326 --> 01:14:21.827
But what if
we're falling in love?

01:14:21.829 --> 01:14:23.095
Dear God...

01:14:23.097 --> 01:14:25.898
I mean, what if this
is what it's like?

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.733
It would end
in disaster.

01:14:27.735 --> 01:14:29.101
- What if it didn't?
- It would.

01:14:29.103 --> 01:14:30.905
- I know.
- Good.

01:14:33.841 --> 01:14:36.041
- But...
- Stop.

01:14:36.043 --> 01:14:37.411
- Ah...
- Stop.

01:14:38.913 --> 01:14:41.914
But...

01:14:49.123 --> 01:14:50.891
Oh!

01:14:54.995 --> 01:14:56.962
This is not funny. Don't
laugh at me, please.

01:14:56.964 --> 01:14:59.464
I'm laughing
out of affection.

01:14:59.466 --> 01:15:01.433
No one laughs at another
person out of affection.

01:15:01.435 --> 01:15:03.335
You laugh at another
person out of contempt.

01:15:03.337 --> 01:15:05.437
No. I'm laughing
'cause it's cute.

01:15:05.439 --> 01:15:06.972
- It is?
- Yes.

01:15:06.974 --> 01:15:08.774
But, fine,
I'll stop laughing.

01:15:08.776 --> 01:15:09.710
Thank you.

01:15:14.882 --> 01:15:16.415
- Frank?
- Yes?

01:15:16.417 --> 01:15:19.518
Don't you, like,
have an instinct about me?

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.788
Nope.

01:15:22.423 --> 01:15:25.123
I think you do.

01:15:25.125 --> 01:15:27.926
You're the one who said
your gut can't be trusted.

01:15:27.928 --> 01:15:29.294
That's true.

01:15:29.296 --> 01:15:31.863
For a long time,
it's been a lying bitch.

01:15:31.865 --> 01:15:34.032
But I would have been willing
to give it another shot.

01:15:34.034 --> 01:15:36.034
Why? I mean, how much shit
has to fall on your head

01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:37.869
before you start
wearing a hat?

01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:41.073
You can't die from jumping
out of a basement window.

01:15:41.075 --> 01:15:43.811
Of course you can. You can hit
your head on a pipe or something.

01:15:47.181 --> 01:15:49.348
You're going to wish you
embraced the miracle, Frank.

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:50.951
You're gonna wish you had.

01:16:30.124 --> 01:16:32.557
How are your pants,
John Wayne Bobbitt?

01:16:32.559 --> 01:16:34.528
Sticky.

01:16:41.902 --> 01:16:44.870
We shouldn't exchange
contact information.

01:16:44.872 --> 01:16:46.438
There's no point.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.008
I think
I just said that.

01:16:49.543 --> 01:16:52.144
It was very nice
to meet you.

01:16:52.146 --> 01:16:54.281
It was very nice
to meet you too.

01:17:00.921 --> 01:17:02.587
I know what
you're going to say...

01:17:02.589 --> 01:17:05.357
- "It's not you, it's me."
- No, it's you.

01:17:05.359 --> 01:17:07.659
It's me.

01:17:07.661 --> 01:17:09.127
Yeah.
I know.

01:17:09.129 --> 01:17:11.396
- It's you.
- I... Yep.

01:17:27.414 --> 01:17:28.916
I liked the bow
though.

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:46.665
Why didn't we meet
seven years ago, Frank?

01:17:46.667 --> 01:17:48.235
Just lucky, I guess.

01:17:52.539 --> 01:17:55.674
14 Catalina Drive,
Newport Beach, please?

01:17:55.676 --> 01:17:58.276
What are you doing?
Don't give your exact address.

01:17:58.278 --> 01:17:59.646
You don't know
who the driver is.

01:18:01.215 --> 01:18:03.281
Thank you for caring.

01:18:03.283 --> 01:18:05.152
I don't. I would've
said the same to anyone.

01:18:07.154 --> 01:18:09.154
We're holding up
the line, Frank.

01:18:09.156 --> 01:18:10.958
There are other people
in the world.

01:18:12.025 --> 01:18:13.360
There are?

01:18:53.768 --> 01:18:55.569
Do you have a whistle?

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:12.184
<i>And then taxation.</i>

01:19:12.186 --> 01:19:15.187
<i>We get shut down
every single time by your...</i>

01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:17.355
- <i>Idea you have so far.</i>
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

01:19:17.357 --> 01:19:18.724
<i>Can I speak?
Can I speak?</i>

01:19:18.726 --> 01:19:19.759
- <i>Please.</i>
<i>- Because of your...</i>

01:19:19.761 --> 01:19:20.860
- <i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>
- <i>That's what I...</i>

01:19:20.862 --> 01:19:23.428
- <i>Just wait a second, all right?</i>
- <i>I'm working on it.</i>

01:19:25.666 --> 01:19:28.333
<i>It's the guys who
stand by in all their philosophies</i>

01:19:28.335 --> 01:19:31.102
<i>and all their ideas and
everything that they represent.</i>

01:19:31.104 --> 01:19:32.705
<i>They're talking about
the silent majority.</i>

01:19:32.707 --> 01:19:35.040
<i>I don't know.
I mean, listen,</i>

01:19:35.042 --> 01:19:37.375
- <i>if you look at the facts again...</i>
<i>- Hold on.</i>

01:19:37.377 --> 01:19:39.277
<i>They're having a sidebar here.
Hold on.</i>

01:19:39.279 --> 01:19:41.680
<i>How can we even bring
that up at this point?</i>

01:19:41.682 --> 01:19:43.348
- <i>But what fact?</i>
<i>- In the media.</i>

01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:44.549
<i>You're not getting paid here.</i>

01:19:44.551 --> 01:19:46.819
<i>You have got to look
at what your guy did too.</i>

01:19:46.821 --> 01:19:48.386
<i>Oh, really?
There it is again.</i>

01:19:48.388 --> 01:19:50.088
<i>There's the same thing
right there.</i>

01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:52.457
<i>It's the same response
for the other side. Yeah.</i>

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:55.327
<i>Yeah, but never mind
because your guy was worse...</i>

01:21:41.508 --> 01:21:46.508
