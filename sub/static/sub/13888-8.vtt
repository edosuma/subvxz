There's a woman in there!

00:29.476 --> 00:31.376
I've been tongue-hockeyed to death!

00:31.545 --> 00:35.345
You know how you told us
to find a solution, however drastic?

00:35.515 --> 00:37.540
What have you got, Kryts?

00:42.322 --> 00:47.589
My left arm, I said! What kind of navigation
officer can't tell left from right?

00:47.761 --> 00:51.629
- We did our best. I am so sorry.
- Mr Lister, you're awake!

00:51.798 --> 00:53.789
Buddy, you look great!

("RED DWARF" THEME)

01:30.737 --> 01:33.467
(TUNELESS STRUMMING)

02:12.145 --> 02:17.014
Oh, bravo, sir! There's no need for
despondency. You can still play the guitar!

02:17.184 --> 02:22.121
Yeah, look on the bright side.
At least now I'm only half crap.

02:22.289 --> 02:24.917
- We should still count our blessings.
- Kryten's right.

02:25.091 --> 02:29.152
You may have lost a limb,
but countless people have lost an arm

02:29.329 --> 02:32.127
and gone on
to lead a perfectly "normal" life.

02:32.299 --> 02:34.927
- Like who?
- Oh, there are thousands, sir.

02:35.101 --> 02:37.433
- Thousands upon thousands.
- Like?

02:37.604 --> 02:39.435
- More than thousands.
- Who?

02:39.606 --> 02:41.335
- Millions!
- Who?

02:41.508 --> 02:44.534
- Well, I can't name them all individually.
- Name one.

02:44.711 --> 02:47.111
One? Hmm... As many as that?

02:47.280 --> 02:50.249
- Lord Nelson. He beat the French.
- Thank you, ma'am.

02:50.417 --> 02:52.408
- He beat the French.
- Who else?

02:52.586 --> 02:56.249
- Well, er...
- The Venus de Milo.

02:56.423 --> 03:00.257
The Venus de Milo.
No arms at all, but that didn't prevent her

03:00.427 --> 03:02.827
from pursuing a successful modelling career.

03:02.996 --> 03:05.464
- Go on.
- Go on?

03:05.632 --> 03:09.830
You said there were millions.
That's two, and one's a statue. Name five.

03:10.003 --> 03:13.268
Five? Right. Well, there's, um...

03:13.440 --> 03:16.534
There's Lord Nelson, and, er... Ms de Milo,

03:16.710 --> 03:18.701
and then there's the... well...

03:18.879 --> 03:21.609
- Help us! Er, the...
- The painter dude!

03:21.781 --> 03:25.012
- What painter dude?
- The Welsh guy. You know?

03:25.185 --> 03:27.551
The one with one arm. Van Gogogogh.

03:27.721 --> 03:30.747
He had one ear. He cut the other one off.

03:30.924 --> 03:32.414
- He did?
- Yes.

03:32.592 --> 03:38.224
See? He manages to cut off his own ear
with one arm, and you're worried.

03:38.398 --> 03:42.459
There must be more... That guy
from "The Fugitive". What was his name?

03:42.636 --> 03:44.695
- The One-Armed Man.
- That's him! That's three.

03:44.871 --> 03:48.307
He was a murderer.
He killed Richard Kimble's wife.

03:48.475 --> 03:52.741
But that proves my point. If that guy
can murder an able-bodied woman

03:52.913 --> 03:56.542
minus a major extremity,
then you've got nothing to worry about.

03:57.984 --> 04:01.385
Let's face it, guys. There aren't
any noteworthy one-armed people.

04:01.555 --> 04:04.683
- You can't even name five.
- Of course we can!

04:04.858 --> 04:07.656
Horatio Nelson,
the one-armed guy from "The Fugitive",

04:07.827 --> 04:11.456
the Venus de Milo,
Van Gogh and... one more...

04:13.266 --> 04:15.393
That Mexican dude!

04:15.569 --> 04:18.560
- The one who robbed people!
- What one?

04:19.706 --> 04:22.140
The one-armed bandit!

04:22.309 --> 04:27.906
That's a machine, you gimp! One of the most
popular pub games of the 20th century.

04:28.081 --> 04:32.609
And it only had one arm?
What a heart-warming story.

04:32.786 --> 04:36.620
- Dave Lister. There. That's five.
- I'm going to the loo.

04:36.790 --> 04:42.160
I don't need to, but as it takes 45 minutes
to undo my flies, I should make a start.

04:42.329 --> 04:44.320
Do you need a hand?

04:44.497 --> 04:47.193
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry!

04:47.367 --> 04:48.857
Sorry...

05:00.213 --> 05:02.147
- Biscuit, sir?
- Please.

05:09.322 --> 05:11.347
- Another bik-bik?
- Yes, please.

05:17.964 --> 05:21.991
- Kryten? What are you doing?
- I'm just dunking bikkies, ma'am.

05:22.168 --> 05:27.105
It's another of life's joys of which
Mr Lister has been robbed. Right, sir?

05:27.273 --> 05:30.003
Could you tweak my nose? I've got an itch.

05:30.176 --> 05:32.872
Itch it yourself. You've still got one arm.

05:33.046 --> 05:35.378
- There. Is that better, sir?
- Yeah, a bit.

05:35.548 --> 05:38.210
Kryten, I told you -
he wants to be independent.

05:38.385 --> 05:41.354
He doesn't need you
treating him like an invalid.

05:41.521 --> 05:45.582
- But he does, he does! Don't you, sir?
- (SIGHS)

05:45.759 --> 05:48.592
- Another slurp, sir?
- This is making me sick.

05:50.130 --> 05:53.327
Take no notice of her, sir.
It's nearly suppertime.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.832
Chuckie-eggs tonight, sir,
with your toast cut up

05:56.002 --> 06:00.098
into little, tiny, weeny,
bite-sized soldiers of varying ranks.

06:00.273 --> 06:04.004
- I can cut up my own toast.
- Just like you asked for.

06:04.177 --> 06:08.477
- Asked for?
- Now, just remember, sir, Kryten knows best!

06:08.648 --> 06:12.744
I'm gonna stretch me legs,
take a walk around the ship.

06:12.919 --> 06:16.320
Just opening the door, sir.
There we go. Door's open, sir.

06:16.489 --> 06:19.185
- Cheers.
- Just closing the door now, sir.

06:19.359 --> 06:22.886
The door's closing, sir.
The door's nearly closed. It's closed, sir.

06:23.363 --> 06:26.491
Florence Nightingdroid, could I have a word?

06:26.666 --> 06:28.657
Certainly, ma'am.

06:30.870 --> 06:34.135
Look, deep down I'm a big softie.

06:34.307 --> 06:38.505
When I saw "Gone With The Wind",
I went through a box of tissues.

06:38.678 --> 06:42.011
"'Now, Voyager",
I couldn't speak for 20 minutes.

06:42.182 --> 06:45.117
I'll make a note, ma'am. "Now Voyager".

06:45.285 --> 06:48.152
Worth keeping on stand-by. Carry on, ma'am!

06:48.321 --> 06:50.619
I'm saying I'm not a heartless bitch,

06:50.790 --> 06:54.123
so understand
that what I'm about to say isn't easy.

06:54.294 --> 06:58.321
Back off Lister.
Let him learn to cope on his own.

06:58.498 --> 07:03.026
- I don't understand, ma'am.
- By helping him, you're not helping him.

07:03.203 --> 07:05.637
Without me,
he wouldn't be wearing underpants!

07:05.805 --> 07:08.672
Have you ever heard
of something called "tough love"?

07:08.842 --> 07:11.902
- Does it involve dressing up?
- No.

07:12.078 --> 07:15.275
Sometimes, to help a person,
you have to get tough,

07:15.448 --> 07:19.544
make them stand on their own two feet -
or in Lister's case, one hand!

07:19.719 --> 07:23.018
I see. So you think
he should brush his own teeth.

07:23.189 --> 07:26.522
I do. It's time
you built him an artificial arm

07:26.693 --> 07:28.854
so he's not so dependant on you.

07:29.028 --> 07:33.897
I was getting around to that, but being
on 24-hour wipe alert, I haven't had time!

07:34.067 --> 07:37.298
Wipe alert? No,
don't even tell me what that means.

07:37.470 --> 07:40.837
I think I know, and it's the grossest thing!

07:41.007 --> 07:44.568
I help him get rid
of the crumbs around his mouth.

07:44.744 --> 07:49.113
Yeah, that's what I thought,
and it's absolutely gross.

07:49.282 --> 07:51.580
Mouth crumbs. Eurgh! Disgusting!

07:58.458 --> 08:03.725
It's a real sonofabitch about your arm, bud.
Losing an arm, that is one terrible thing.

08:03.897 --> 08:06.923
- Your move.
- Can you imagine that?

08:07.100 --> 08:12.060
One minute, you got two arms,
and the next - zing... doof! - You got one.

08:12.238 --> 08:13.899
Hoo-ee! That's tough.

08:14.941 --> 08:16.670
Your move.

08:16.843 --> 08:21.109
And we must need two arms.
That's why we got two arms.

08:21.281 --> 08:23.374
Well, except you.

08:23.550 --> 08:25.017
Your move.

08:27.287 --> 08:31.155
You're probably wondering,
"Is it going to affect my life?"

08:31.324 --> 08:33.792
I think the answer is, "Yes, it is."

08:33.960 --> 08:36.793
Your smegging move.

08:36.962 --> 08:39.557
If it were me, I couldn't survive.

08:39.732 --> 08:44.169
I'd climb to the top of my tallest
platform boots and leap to my death.

08:44.337 --> 08:47.602
- I couldn't stand not being perfect.
- Your move.

08:47.774 --> 08:53.178
But with you I think it's different.
Take a pit bull, a real ugly sonofabitch.

08:53.346 --> 08:59.216
It loses its leg somehow and says to you,
"Hey, man! I've only got three legs.

08:59.385 --> 09:01.478
"Will lady pit bulls still like me?"

09:03.823 --> 09:06.257
You've gotta stop from laughing, haven't you?

09:06.426 --> 09:09.657
He's ugly with four legs! He's ugly with three!

09:09.829 --> 09:13.492
Hell, he'd be ugly in a suit with a carnation.

09:13.666 --> 09:16.726
So here's something
that's gonna cheer you up!

09:16.903 --> 09:19.133
It's your move.

09:19.305 --> 09:21.830
- Mr Pit Bull? Put it there, buddy!
- MOVE!

09:22.909 --> 09:25.503
OK, OK. I'm going!

09:25.678 --> 09:30.012
I don't think
you've been listening to a thing I've said.

09:41.561 --> 09:46.021
Now, this is the standard model
from the 21st century. Comfortable, sir?

09:46.199 --> 09:48.759
- It's fine, yeah.
- OK, now let's recap -

09:48.935 --> 09:53.099
the limb is connected to neurons
on the left hemisphere of your brain,

09:53.273 --> 09:55.741
which controls the right side of your body.

09:55.909 --> 10:00.005
You merely command the arm
to do something, and it obeys.

10:00.179 --> 10:02.545
Now, let's practise.

10:03.716 --> 10:09.313
Right, concentrate, sir.
I want you to think, "Arm, pick up the ball."

10:09.923 --> 10:14.826
OK? Now just think, "I will pick up the ball."

10:14.994 --> 10:17.428
- I will pick up the ball.
- Good. Concentrate.

10:17.597 --> 10:20.794
- I will pick up the ball.
- OK, now really think,

10:20.967 --> 10:23.231
- "Hand..."
- I will pick up the ball.

10:23.403 --> 10:26.099
- That's right.
- Hand, pick up the ball.

10:26.272 --> 10:29.503
- "Hand, pick up the ball!"
- Hand, pick up the ball!

10:29.676 --> 10:31.268
- Keep going.
- Pick up the ball!

10:31.444 --> 10:34.242
- Now focus onto that.
- Pick up the ball!

10:34.414 --> 10:38.441
"Hand, pick up the ball!"
That's right, sir. Really think, now.

10:38.618 --> 10:41.143
"Hand, pick up the ball!"
Really get it going, sir!

10:41.321 --> 10:44.848
"Pick up the ball! Hand, pick up the ball!"

10:45.024 --> 10:48.926
Really start to move it now, sir!
"Hand, pick up the ball!"

10:49.095 --> 10:53.862
Keep going, sir! You CAN do it!
"Hand, pick up the ball!"

10:54.033 --> 10:57.400
You're going to move it! Move that hand, sir!

10:57.570 --> 11:01.199
Pick up the ball!
Yes, sir! We've got some movement, sir!

11:01.374 --> 11:03.865
Yes! The finger is moving! Yes!

11:04.043 --> 11:05.874
Oh! Bravo, sir!

11:06.679 --> 11:10.740
- Oh! The sweat's dripping off me!
- Oh, that was fantastic, sir!

11:10.917 --> 11:13.511
- It worked like a dream!
- Is that it?

11:13.686 --> 11:15.711
- Sir?
- Is that the best it works?

11:15.888 --> 11:18.584
To pick up a ball, I need the morning off.

11:18.758 --> 11:21.488
It was a tad slow, I'm forced to admit.

11:21.661 --> 11:25.119
The only thing that picks up slower
is Rimmer in a disco.

11:25.298 --> 11:31.237
Maybe if I adjust the impulse valve,
it might make it a little more sensitive.

11:31.404 --> 11:34.498
OK, let's try again.
"Hand, pick up the ball."

11:34.674 --> 11:38.303
OK. Hand, pick up the ball.

11:38.478 --> 11:39.968
(CLUNK)

11:41.748 --> 11:45.184
OK. Right. Well, er, let's try again.

11:45.752 --> 11:50.314
- OK?
- Now, "Hand, pick up the ball."

11:50.490 --> 11:52.481
Hand, pick up the ball.

11:55.928 --> 11:59.921
I think, sir, the anger inside you
is driving the arm.

12:00.099 --> 12:03.193
- I don't feel angry.
- You've lost your arm, sir.

12:03.369 --> 12:05.860
- You've every right to feel angry.
- I don't!

12:06.039 --> 12:10.100
You see, it's subconscious.
You're thinking, "Hand, pick up the ball,"

12:10.276 --> 12:13.575
but your subconscious
is saying, "Punch Kryten in the head.

12:13.746 --> 12:17.546
"Beat the brains out
of the demented droid that cut off my arm."

12:17.717 --> 12:20.117
- Kryten, that's rubbish!
- (CLANG)

12:21.120 --> 12:24.681
You're right!
It's controlled by my subconscious!

12:25.758 --> 12:28.022
It's too dangerous to keep that arm, sir.

12:28.194 --> 12:32.893
Two minutes with Miss Kochanski and who knows
what you'd be swinging around your head?

12:35.468 --> 12:37.868
There must be a solution to this.

12:38.037 --> 12:41.564
Hey, half-eaten-lollipop-head,
what about one of your spares?

12:41.741 --> 12:43.766
- Whaddaya say, motherboarder?
- Too heavy, sir.

12:43.943 --> 12:47.344
The extra weight would
prevent Mr Lister getting it up.

12:47.513 --> 12:51.142
He could take it off if he was going on a date.

12:51.317 --> 12:53.615
Someone do something to him,

12:53.786 --> 12:56.619
ideally involving ice cubes
and any puckered body cavity.

12:58.224 --> 13:01.455
Wait a minute.
Can't your self-repair system help?

13:01.627 --> 13:04.118
- Ma'am?
- When you have a mechanical failure,

13:04.297 --> 13:06.288
it fixes itself, doesn't it?

13:06.466 --> 13:10.527
The Kryten back in my dimension
had these tiny little robots. Subatomic?

13:10.703 --> 13:14.139
Nanobots. They break objects down
into their component atoms,

13:14.307 --> 13:16.901
then recombine those atoms
to repair damaged circuits.

13:17.076 --> 13:20.876
- Nanotechnology.
- Just run that by me one more time,

13:21.047 --> 13:25.245
but do the big-writing version
with pictures, one word a page?

13:25.418 --> 13:28.046
Let me think of a cogent paradigm.

13:28.221 --> 13:30.883
I'd rather have a good example.

13:31.057 --> 13:34.220
This is a lead pencil. It's made of graphite,

13:34.393 --> 13:37.191
a particular arrangement of carbon atoms.

13:37.363 --> 13:41.265
This is diamond.
It too is made of carbon atoms.

13:41.434 --> 13:44.892
Nanobots can rearrange atoms
so they could take this lead pencil,

13:45.071 --> 13:48.370
move the atoms around a bit
and turn it into diamond.

13:48.541 --> 13:51.169
It's possible to make diamonds out of pencils?

13:51.344 --> 13:54.177
It's possible
to make computer chips out of sand.

13:54.347 --> 13:57.839
So what if we transferred
some of your nanobots into Dave?

13:58.017 --> 14:01.316
Could they build him a new arm
from excess body tissue?

14:01.487 --> 14:03.785
Unfortunately, ma'am, it's not possible, no.

14:03.956 --> 14:07.392
- Why not?
- I have no nanobots. They deserted me.

14:07.560 --> 14:13.021
- When and where, I can't be certain.
- But if we find them, could they do it?

14:13.199 --> 14:17.966
But finding them would be like looking
for a needle in a male student's flat.

14:18.137 --> 14:23.302
- When was the last repair they made?
- On the Esperanto, before the Despair Squid.

14:23.476 --> 14:26.172
(TUTS) That was before we lost the Dwarf.

14:26.345 --> 14:29.940
- That's why I've given up hope.
- Set a course for the Esperanto.

14:31.083 --> 14:33.643
But I promise you it's futile, sir.

14:33.819 --> 14:36.083
I'll start preparing
the suspended animation booths.

15:15.027 --> 15:17.860
Hang on a minute. Where the smeg are we?

15:18.030 --> 15:21.056
The computer woke us early.
It must have something.

15:21.234 --> 15:23.964
Maybe it's something to do
with this planetoid?

15:24.136 --> 15:27.037
Just scanning, sir... No, that's ridiculous.

15:27.206 --> 15:29.674
- What is?
- It's not even worth mentioning, ma'am.

15:29.842 --> 15:32.675
Must be a scanner fault. Rescanning.

15:32.845 --> 15:35.405
- What? Again?
- What is it, man?

15:35.581 --> 15:39.642
You look shakier than a silicon implant ward
during an earthquake.

15:39.819 --> 15:43.949
Well, according to all our scanners,
that planetoid out there is... Red Dwarf.

15:44.123 --> 15:46.956
- Gah! Must be on the blink.
- Of course it is.

15:47.126 --> 15:51.893
This is a piece of equipment that detected
a planet entirely populated by air hostesses.

15:52.064 --> 15:54.498
We spent two weeks checking that out.

15:55.301 --> 15:59.829
I knew we gave up to soon!
It was worth at least one more week.

16:00.006 --> 16:02.839
- However, there is one additional factor.
- Which is?

16:03.009 --> 16:06.069
- That we've been here before.
- It's the cockpit, dummy!

16:06.245 --> 16:08.713
We come here all the time.

16:08.881 --> 16:11.315
Doesn't this sector
of the galaxy look familiar?

16:11.484 --> 16:15.580
Kryten, it's space. Black with twinkly bits.
It all looks familiar.

16:15.755 --> 16:21.660
On the port side, sir, is the ocean world
where we discovered the Esperanto.

16:25.031 --> 16:27.727
That was just before we lost Red Dwarf.

16:27.900 --> 16:30.960
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I'm thinking leather underpants

16:31.137 --> 16:34.971
with silver studs are a mistake
if you wear them inside out.

16:35.141 --> 16:39.305
- What are you thinking?
- About a mallet, you and ice cubes again.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.777
- This planetoid, let's check it out.
- The weather scan says it's beautiful.

16:44.950 --> 16:49.751
Tropical temperatures, not a cloud in sight.
Suggest we dress for snow and take the buggy.

16:51.324 --> 16:54.191
(THUNDER CRASHES, WIND HOWLS)

16:56.796 --> 16:59.765
Take some readings
and grab some soil samples.

16:59.932 --> 17:03.595
- Looks kinda blowy.
- It's an electric storm.

17:03.769 --> 17:08.672
There must be more electricity than
the surge that went through the National Grid

17:08.840 --> 17:12.709

all-girl custard wrestling finals.

Phew!

17:24.056 --> 17:28.652
I can't believe you're here.
How did you persuade Kryten to let you out?

17:28.828 --> 17:34.391
He's not my mum, Kris. I hope the Cat's not
too long, I promised we'd be back by tea.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.296
Joke.

17:43.275 --> 17:45.266
It's impossible out there!

17:47.113 --> 17:50.708
- Do you need some different goggles?
- No, I need a comb!

18:06.599 --> 18:08.590
- Sweet?
- Thanks.

18:25.484 --> 18:27.975
- Here, have another one.
- I can do it.

18:28.154 --> 18:32.921
- Don't be silly. Let me.
- I can do it, really. I'm not an idiot.

18:42.868 --> 18:44.859

19:08.093 --> 19:12.826
Can I ask you a question?
Now that I've got no arm, does it...

19:14.600 --> 19:17.330
does it make any difference to anything?

19:18.337 --> 19:22.899
I mean,
if you were a female pit bull terrier,

19:23.075 --> 19:26.010
how would you feel about a three-legged?

19:26.812 --> 19:31.511
Does it make any difference to - plucking
any old relationship out of the air - us?

19:31.684 --> 19:37.088
Dave, before you lost your arm,
I thought you were a no-good, disgusting bum.

19:37.256 --> 19:43.559
- And I still do. So no, none at all.
- Will this make any difference to women?

19:43.729 --> 19:48.689
Losing an arm isn't going to make any
difference to any woman who cares about you.

19:48.868 --> 19:50.301
- Really?
- Really.

19:50.469 --> 19:54.166
- What about sex?
- Not here. It's too sandy.

20:00.346 --> 20:02.974
- How did you get on?
- Take a look.

20:05.251 --> 20:09.813
This sand didn't start out as sand atoms.
They've been engineered nanobotically.

20:09.989 --> 20:12.549
- From what?
- Computer chips, you name it.

20:12.725 --> 20:16.991
According to the particle analyser,
this planetoid is Red Dwarf.

20:18.964 --> 20:21.728
- Where are you going?
- I'll need some help!

20:21.901 --> 20:25.359
There's a lot of stuff out there
worth checking out!

20:25.538 --> 20:27.802
What stuff?

20:27.973 --> 20:30.908
Hey, it feels like the storm's easing off!

20:31.076 --> 20:33.408
Come and see for yourself!

20:38.751 --> 20:43.211
Oh, I was beginning to worry!
Oh! What on earth is this?

20:43.389 --> 20:46.620
The whole damn planetoid's packed
with stuff from Red Dwarf.

20:46.792 --> 20:49.556
Supplies, bunks,
drinks dispensers, you name it.

20:49.728 --> 20:53.425
- It's like a giant car boot sale!
- We got some valuable stuff!

20:54.633 --> 20:59.366
What? Napkin rings?
A box of hairnet requisition forms?

20:59.538 --> 21:02.939
A motorised tie rack and an inflatable shark?

21:03.108 --> 21:05.975
- What a haul (!)
- There must be some useful stuff.

21:06.145 --> 21:08.375
I couldn't see what I was getting.

21:13.319 --> 21:15.310
<i>All right, dudes?</i>

21:18.524 --> 21:22.221
- What the smeg are you doing here, Hol?
- <i>Those little wotsits.</i>

21:22.394 --> 21:25.124
- Nanobots?
- <i>They remolicurised...</i>

21:25.297 --> 21:27.390
<i>They remolic... They remol...</i>

21:28.367 --> 21:32.428
<i>Anyway, they did that word</i>
<i>that I can't say to the whole ship</i>

21:32.605 --> 21:35.039
<i>and left the bits they didn't want!</i>

21:35.207 --> 21:38.768
What? They fixed your core program,
then decided to leave you?

21:38.944 --> 21:41.412
<i>Yeah, it was shortly after they'd met me.</i>

21:43.015 --> 21:46.178
Well, from one machine to another,
welcome back online, Holly!

<i>That's quite horrific, isn't it?</i>

<i>Cheap razor? It's just not worth</i>
<i>buying them from garages, is it?</i>

21:56.729 --> 22:00.028
- Don't you remember me? I'm Kryten.
- <i>Kryten?</i>

22:00.199 --> 22:01.860
<i>I'm sorry, mate.</i>

22:02.034 --> 22:07.802
<i>It's the way the light was shining on your</i> -
<i>what's the word?</i> - <i>"face" I suppose.</i>

22:07.973 --> 22:12.603
<i>I just didn't recognise you for a minute.</i>
<i>Never forget a face, usually. Never.</i>

22:12.778 --> 22:16.509
- It's good to see you again.
- <i>And you are?</i>

22:16.682 --> 22:20.778
Unbelievable. Dumped on a planet
in the middle of an electro-storm

22:20.953 --> 22:25.583
and left to rot for hundreds of years,
and the guy's lost nothing.

22:26.892 --> 22:32.455
So, while we were on the Esperanto, your
nanobots mutinied and took over Red Dwarf?

22:32.631 --> 22:38.126
They wanted a ship. My body had nothing new,
but Red Dwarf itself was far too big.

22:38.303 --> 22:41.329
But they're nanobots. They can change
anything into anything else.

22:41.507 --> 22:44.567
Yeah, they can turn a Pot Noodle into food.

22:44.743 --> 22:48.372
So they took Red Dwarf,
made a subatomic version,

22:48.547 --> 22:51.607
and turned the rest
of the atoms into a planetoid?

22:51.784 --> 22:55.015
What were we chasing?
What was producing that vapour trail?

22:55.187 --> 22:59.681
- Red Dwarf.
- Did someone turn over two pages at once?

22:59.858 --> 23:04.318
We were chasing the nano-Red Dwarf.
That's why the readings were so minute.

23:04.496 --> 23:08.489
So now they could be anywhere?
You pursued them across half the galaxy.

23:08.667 --> 23:12.569
Until we lost track of the readings -
a scanner malfunction.

23:12.738 --> 23:15.229
<i>Or they went out of reach of your scanners.</i>

23:15.407 --> 23:18.376
But we were gaining on them, bud.

23:18.544 --> 23:22.947
<i>Scanners scan on the outside.</i>
<i>To escape, they just had to stop.</i>

23:23.115 --> 23:27.415
You mean, the nanos could be in here,
on board Starbug somewhere?

23:27.586 --> 23:30.077
Hey, he could be right.

23:31.757 --> 23:35.249
<i>He's back. Kicking bottom or what?</i>

23:39.665 --> 23:41.792

23:42.501 --> 23:44.492
- What are you getting?
- Nothing yet.

23:44.670 --> 23:49.107
Just two pieces of Bombay aloo you dropped
several millennia ago down the ducts,

23:49.274 --> 23:53.608
where they appear to evolved a rudimentary
intelligence and formed a folk duo.

23:53.779 --> 23:55.770
- Damn scanner.
- Keep looking.

23:56.682 --> 23:59.378
Narrowing parameters. Oh.

23:59.551 --> 24:03.453
Oh, my. You were right, sir.
I think we've found them.

24:03.622 --> 24:05.214
Where?

24:07.659 --> 24:09.490
They're there, OK.

24:09.661 --> 24:13.927
So Red Dwarf spent the last two years
exploring my laundry basket?

24:14.767 --> 24:17.793
The ship is now so small that to the nanos

24:17.970 --> 24:21.497

is the size of a galaxy!

<i>then explore a macro-universe</i>
<i>in a laundry basket.</i>

<i>How could you fall for an old scam like that?</i>

24:41.760 --> 24:44.490
Ma'am, tell me if the readings change.

24:44.663 --> 24:46.654
(FAINT BLEEPING)

24:51.103 --> 24:52.400
Same.

24:56.275 --> 24:58.266
Still the same.

25:00.646 --> 25:02.671
- Still the same!
- They've changed!

25:02.848 --> 25:07.148
Ha! Nailed the little blighters! After
all the embarrassment they've caused me!

25:08.353 --> 25:10.514

25:12.291 --> 25:15.283
Leave it to me, sir. I'll make contact.

25:16.295 --> 25:18.559
Can you hear me, you little critters?

25:18.730 --> 25:23.758
We want our ship back and a new arm
for Mr Lister! Are you receiving me?

25:24.803 --> 25:26.896

25:30.475 --> 25:33.876
They're communicating in machine code.
Leave the talking to me.

Have you any idea what you've done,
deserting your droid?

25:37.316 --> 25:39.307
You've broken every reg in the manual!

25:41.086 --> 25:45.182
And to compound matters
by stealing our ship, it's unbelievably...

25:45.357 --> 25:48.520
Er... It's unbelievably... naughty.

25:49.928 --> 25:52.192
Now, listen up. Here's the deal.

25:52.364 --> 25:54.889
We want that planetoid
turned back into Red Dwarf

25:55.067 --> 25:58.503
and we want you
to build a new arm for Mr Lister.

25:58.670 --> 26:02.663

- Here.

26:16.088 --> 26:19.751

Millions and millions of them.

26:19.925 --> 26:22.655
Now I just insert them into your body.

- Hypodermic, sir.
- Thank God for that.

for before. They can have another go, OK?
