But it'll say 2:1 on my CV.

01:48.080 --> 01:52.596

Should it maybe say 2:1, or maybe just 1?.

- No, because, as a friend,

that you might not have a 2:1.

something amazing like...

anyway, cos I figure, like,

they'll probably put me

and now we're getting the blame!

I don't even need a 2:1 to do that.

Maybe you should have it.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.598

No! We need to confront this like adults.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.953
Ooh, I know. We could sing a song
from The Sound Of Music

11:11.000 --> 11:12.399
and have a mental breakdown.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.396
- (JOSlE LAUGHS)
- JP: That's an option.

11:15.720 --> 11:21.158
So, I have found the London house,
as per our group agreement.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.315
Did we agree?.

11:24.360 --> 11:27.193
You assented by making
positive faces and noises.

11:27.240 --> 11:31.279
Thus I have, er,
found ourselves a house to share

11:31.320 --> 11:35.074
in the lovely-sounding Colliers Wood.
Here.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.833
Hmm.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.156
"Victorian period property.
Easily maintained gardens."

11:41.200 --> 11:43.475
- Sounds great.
- I'll be back in a minute.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.360
We're obviously
not going to live with him, are we?.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.676
God, no, I wouldn't be seen dead
in Colliers Wood! It's in Zone 3!

11:50.720 --> 11:51.869
We should tell him now.

11:51.920 --> 11:56.198
You know, I was so scared
about moving to London,

11:56.240 --> 11:58.515
the only way I can imagine doing it
is with you guys,

11:58.560 --> 12:04.396
so... here's the lease for
House Share 2: Share Harder!

12:08.960 --> 12:12.077
Yes! Fucking yes, I got it!
I fucking got it!

12:12.120 --> 12:15.157
You're listening to
Kingsley's Overexcited FM! Yeah!

12:15.200 --> 12:18.556
- That's my station ident.
- Yeah, I think I'll stick to Radio 2.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.114
- What's the, er, starting salary?.
- Um...

12:21.160 --> 12:22.832
GlRL: Kingsley!

12:22.880 --> 12:25.917
- It's gonna be awesome!
- Yeah, you know it!

12:25.960 --> 12:27.791

12:27.840 --> 12:29.398
I think I'm gonna be sick!

12:29.440 --> 12:32.910
Oh, my God!
The attack dogs at midnight are back

12:32.960 --> 12:35.190
and they have torn
academic precedents to shreds!

12:35.240 --> 12:40.268
I can't believe I've got an answer so
quickly. Novel writing, here in Mancunia!

12:40.320 --> 12:43.153
I'm, like, the first person
to ever get on an MA with a 2:2!

12:43.200 --> 12:46.397
They must've really loved my sample.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.591
Where is my dad?. Pfft!
I need to keep him away from my mum

12:49.640 --> 12:53.315
in case she gets all glug-glug,
shouty-shouty, punchy-fucky!

12:53.360 --> 12:54.839
Here comes my mum...

12:56.560 --> 13:00.269
...carrying her sick dog
for maximum emotional manipulation.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.719
OK, right, guys - group huddle.

13:01.760 --> 13:05.355
Can everyone please remember
to call me Melissa in front of my mum?.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.676
Also, please can everyone pretend
that I'm still the president of the union,

13:08.720 --> 13:11.109
and that I got a first,
and also, don't mention

13:11.160 --> 13:13.958
the fact I had an affair
with Tony Shales and his son.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.513
Not affair, relationship.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.836
And also, can please nobody mention
that I snapped a man's banjo string

13:18.880 --> 13:22.111
whilst making love to him on a table,
which resulted in him being deported?.

13:22.160 --> 13:26.233
Yeah, I think I might just ignore your mum
altogether. Seems like the safest option.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.750
- OK.
- There she is! My daughter Melissa!

13:29.800 --> 13:33.475
President of the student union
with her first class degree!

13:33.520 --> 13:37.035
With a place on an MA in novel writing
right here in Manchester!

13:37.080 --> 13:38.752
(LAUGHS EXClTEDLY)

13:39.880 --> 13:41.393
Isn't she incredible?.!

13:41.440 --> 13:44.398
Jeeps! Mate!

13:44.440 --> 13:47.477
- You fucking did it!
- I mean, yeah, OK,

13:47.520 --> 13:50.159
Manchester's not exactly Durham or Exeter

13:50.200 --> 13:53.875
or Bristol or St Andrew's or lmperial

13:53.920 --> 13:57.435
or even, like,
Newcastle or UCR, but still, l...

13:57.480 --> 14:01.917
I'm amazed you graduated.
So, er... So thank fuck for that!

14:01.960 --> 14:04.713
I mean, it might've been tricky
holding the job open for you otherwise.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.753
Yeah, um, do you think it would be all
right if we waited a year until I started?.

14:08.800 --> 14:13.351
You know, like a suspended...
I don't wanna say sentence,

14:13.400 --> 14:17.678
but maybe I could take another year off,
just get my head together?.

14:17.720 --> 14:21.633
No! I'm sending you straight into the City
to milk the money titty!

14:21.680 --> 14:25.150

and worth a lump sum.

- Give him a kiss.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.636

It's disgusting. No kissing.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.435
Melissa, I've waited 20 years for this.

I've got a little something for you
that might cheer you up.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.393
Golden scroll.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.032
Golden girl.

15:31.080 --> 15:34.072

- Tony, that's very weird.

I don't understand - the new president?.

16:39.920 --> 16:46.393
My theme today is how should we behave
as adults in the real world?.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.671
As you know, our previous president -
Melissa Shawcross -

16:49.720 --> 16:55.192
was impeached and ousted
for gross misconduct, so...

16:55.240 --> 16:57.117
not like her.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.673
(LAUGHTER)

16:58.720 --> 16:59.709
(BOOlNG)

17:02.160 --> 17:06.631
So, I didn't get offered a Fulbright
and I'm not the president.

17:06.680 --> 17:11.356
I was ousted due to gross mismanagement
and corruption.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.678
Also, I had an affair with my tutor,
Professor Shales.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.393
- Oh, my God! Melissa!
- And his son Dylan.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.352
Also, I didn't get a first.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.435
You got a 2:1?.

17:25.119 --> 17:26.234
A 2:2.

17:26.280 --> 17:30.239
Oh...God! I'm so humiliated!

17:30.280 --> 17:33.556
- Melissa, you're such a disappointment!
- VOD: No, she isn't, love!

17:33.600 --> 17:35.989
She's the best president we ever had!

17:36.040 --> 17:42.957
But while she was thinking big
about poetry and education and chips,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.719
all these fuckheads wanted to think about

17:45.760 --> 17:50.515
was rugby and badminton
and careers and degrees!

17:50.560 --> 17:53.711
I mean, yeah, she got rejected,

17:53.760 --> 17:57.389
but so did Jesus, and JK Rowling.

17:57.440 --> 18:03.356
And, if it wasn't for Oregon,
I wouldn't even have a degree.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.197
She let me copy her coursework.

18:05.240 --> 18:09.950
She... inspired me to think about books.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.560
Even the ones written by wankers
to fake you out.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.114
Thank you, Vod.

18:16.160 --> 18:20.358
And she did not mean to snap
that guy's dong. That was an accident.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.958
I hadn't actually mentioned that.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.713
Who the hell is Oregon?.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.790
I'm Oregon and I'm going to stay here
and I'm going to learn to be a writer.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.594
I got on the MA creative writing course,
even though I only got a 2:2!

18:34.640 --> 18:36.915
No-one's ever done that before!

18:36.960 --> 18:39.428
And it's all down
to how good a writer I am!

18:39.480 --> 18:42.870
I'm going to be one of this country's
greatest novelists,

18:42.920 --> 18:45.036

is anything to go by!

18:45.080 --> 18:47.833
- Oregon...
- Um?.

18:47.880 --> 18:50.917
Glad I could help with the MA, by the way.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.030
I quietly binned Attack Dogs Of Midnight

18:53.080 --> 18:55.355
for a little something
from my own humble quill,

18:55.400 --> 19:01.748
and in you slid, past the adjudicators
and straight onto my little course.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.279

to meet your family,

that massively gives me the horn.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.669
But on the other hand...

22:17.720 --> 22:19.358
it kind of makes me want to cry.

22:19.400 --> 22:23.359
And the wanting to cry's
making my horn go soft.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.709
Because it turns out tears beats horn

35:38.440 --> 35:40.715
Jose has got something
she'd like to share with the group.

35:40.760 --> 35:41.875
Have l?.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.956
Yes. You do.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.549
Something she wants to shout out
so that all of Manchester can hear.

35:49.760 --> 35:50.909
Fine.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.031
I think...

35:55.080 --> 35:56.195
that JP...

35:57.400 --> 35:59.789
...is quite all right, probably.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.078
OTHERS: Ooh!

36:08.240 --> 36:09.878
Hey, can you also shout that... (WHlSPERS)

36:11.320 --> 36:13.356
No! Because that's disgusting.

36:15.160 --> 36:18.630
But I do think that we should give
a long-distance relationship a try.

36:18.680 --> 36:21.194
Cos...they often work out. Right, guys?.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.071
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

36:23.120 --> 36:24.519
Like, these days, yeah.

36:24.560 --> 36:28.394
You know, I think I'm finally beginning
to accept you for who you really are.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.668
Good.

36:30.760 --> 36:31.795
Because...

36:32.880 --> 36:34.393
... I've decided I'm not a cartoonist.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.354
I'm going to become an estate agent.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.311
And work for Foxons.

36:41.360 --> 36:44.033
And if I'm really lucky,
get one of those cool Minis.

36:45.440 --> 36:46.873
Good...

36:46.920 --> 36:48.353
Great.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.033
That's interesting.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.150
You told me to follow my dream,

36:53.200 --> 36:55.475
- and I am.
- Yes.

36:55.520 --> 36:58.990
I mean, I did think that your dream
might be to be an artist,

36:59.040 --> 37:00.268
- but...
- Nope.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.710
Broom-broom, beep-beep, percentage
of the purchase price, please.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.996
What about you, Kings?.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.678
Oh, well, my internship's unpaid,

37:08.720 --> 37:12.508
so I'm gonna be living back
with my lovely, inescapable mum.

37:12.560 --> 37:15.518
Don't be silly, Nutsack.
You can come live with me.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.993
Rent-free.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.871
How do you feel about that, Kingsley?.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.990
Living with an estate agent in Chelsea.

37:21.040 --> 37:24.953
An estate agent who is your
ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.758
The thing is, that is actually
too good an offer to refuse,

37:30.800 --> 37:32.950
so...yes, thank you.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.718
I would love that.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.193
Awesome!

37:36.240 --> 37:39.471
And then when Jose comes down to stay,
it'll be just like old times, eh?.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.509
Yeah.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.314
Listen.

37:53.360 --> 37:54.873
I think I might go.

37:54.920 --> 37:55.909
To Laos.

37:55.960 --> 37:59.270
And, um... I'd love you to come with me.

37:59.320 --> 38:02.312
Particularly as I don't properly
know where it is.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.796
I could write, and you could teach English
as a foreign language.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.115
Sounds pretty good.

38:13.280 --> 38:18.070
Now that I've run my own festival,
I could also run Burning Man.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.758
Yeah.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.028
(CONVERSATlON RECEDES)

38:21.080 --> 38:23.719
How long's it gonna take you
to get back to Scotland?.

38:24.920 --> 38:25.909
Scotland?.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.951
I don't live in Scotland.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.399
I live in Manchester.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.238
My, er, mum and dad's house
is two streets away.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.759
What?.!

38:33.800 --> 38:35.597
Why did you never say anything?.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.438
Because they're excruciatingly
embarrassing.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.153
- Are you ready, Howard?.
- Yes, Dad.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.039
- It's lovely to meet you all.
- Embarrassing.

38:45.080 --> 38:47.640
- Heard so much about you!
- Painful.

38:47.680 --> 38:49.033
If you're ever up this way again,

38:49.080 --> 38:52.516
- do drop by for some tea and cake.
- ldiotic!

38:52.560 --> 38:54.437
Yes. My parents are cliches.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.160
Hey. So, er...

39:00.200 --> 39:01.189
bye.

39:01.240 --> 39:02.514
You gonna be OK?.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.676
Yeah. I'll be fine.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.393
I'm gonna ask Sabine
to live with me nex year.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.512
Purge myself of all my class
and racial prejudice.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.469
Bye.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.839
OK. Bye.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.309
# We were sleeping in for years

39:26.360 --> 39:30.911
# Letting go of our friends

39:30.960 --> 39:33.952
# Scaring our friends

39:34.000 --> 39:39.120
# We were seeing clearer closing our eyes

39:39.160 --> 39:44.188
# And our lashes intertwined

39:44.240 --> 39:49.598
# Do I lie in the backseat

39:49.640 --> 39:52.029
# Of your mind?.

39:52.080 --> 39:55.038
# Just a second

39:55.080 --> 39:57.230
# And we're gone

39:57.280 --> 40:00.158
# Just an imprint

40:00.200 --> 40:02.589
# When we're done

40:02.640 --> 40:07.668
# Just a second and we're gone

40:07.720 --> 40:12.919
# Just an imprint when we're done

40:14.840 --> 40:20.119
# It should be forever

40:20.160 --> 40:22.993
# God told me

40:25.520 --> 40:30.514
# We're born into the wrong time

40:30.560 --> 40:35.680
# It should be forever

40:35.720 --> 40:38.757
# God told me

40:41.720 --> 40:47.078
# We're born into the wrong time

40:47.120 --> 40:51.591
# It should be forever

40:51.640 --> 40:54.473
# God told me... #
