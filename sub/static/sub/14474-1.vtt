01:36.348 --> 01:37.432
Where?

01:38.434 --> 01:40.351
I want a haircut.

01:41.103 --> 01:43.104
The president's in town.

01:43.314 --> 01:44.522
We don't care.

01:45.149 --> 01:47.692
We need a haircut.
We need to go across town.

01:48.277 --> 01:52.030
We'll hit traffic that
speaks in quarter inches.

01:52.406 --> 01:55.200
Just so I know...

01:55.284 --> 01:57.452
...which president
are we talking about?

01:57.453 --> 01:59.704
United States.

01:59.830 --> 02:01.581
Barriers will be setup.

02:02.249 --> 02:04.626
Entire streets deleted
from the map.

02:06.378 --> 02:08.378
Show me my car.

02:14.303 --> 02:15.470
What have we learned then?

02:15.679 --> 02:18.139
Our system is secure.
We're impenetrable.

02:18.474 --> 02:19.933
There's no rogue program.

02:20.226 --> 02:21.768
It would seem, however...

02:21.769 --> 02:24.312
- Eric!
- No, we ran every test.

02:25.231 --> 02:28.399
No one's overloading the
system or manipulating our sites.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.692
When do we do all this?

02:29.693 --> 02:30.485
Yesterday.

02:30.486 --> 02:32.820
At the complex, our rapid response team.

02:33.072 --> 02:35.490
There is no vulnerable point of entry.

02:35.491 --> 02:37.909
Our insurer did a threat analysis.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.577
We are buffered from attack.

02:39.578 --> 02:40.286
Everywhere.

02:40.412 --> 02:41.120
Yes.

02:41.413 --> 02:42.705
Including the car?

02:43.374 --> 02:45.083
Including, absolutely, yes.

02:45.084 --> 02:46.292
My car, this car...

02:46.293 --> 02:48.378
Eric, yes! Please...

02:50.798 --> 02:55.009
We've been together, you and I,
since the little-bitty startup.

02:55.177 --> 02:59.013
I want you to tell me that
you still have the stamina to do this job.

02:59.431 --> 03:00.390
Single mindedness.

03:00.391 --> 03:02.475
This car, your car...

03:02.476 --> 03:04.561
The relentless will.

03:05.521 --> 03:07.438
'cause I keep hearing
about our legend

03:07.439 --> 03:10.775
that we were young, 
smart and raised by wolves

03:10.776 --> 03:12.861
that the phenomena of reputation

03:12.862 --> 03:16.239
is a delicate thing.
Person rises on a word

03:16.240 --> 03:18.867
and falls on a syllable.

03:20.494 --> 03:21.995
I know I'm asking the wrong man.

03:21.996 --> 03:23.079
Oh, what?

03:23.706 --> 03:26.541
Where's the car last night
after we ran our tests?

03:26.750 --> 03:28.459
I...

03:29.044 --> 03:31.629
I don't know.

03:35.259 --> 03:37.468
Where do all these limos go at night?

03:38.012 --> 03:39.971
I know I'm changing the subject.

03:39.972 --> 03:41.472
Haven't been sleeping much.

03:41.473 --> 03:43.558
I look at books and drink brandy.

03:43.559 --> 03:48.479
What happens to all these stretched
limousines that prowl the throbbing city all day long?

03:48.480 --> 03:50.231
Where do they spend the night?

03:57.698 --> 04:02.076
Do you ever get the feeling, sometimes,
that you don't know what's going on?

04:04.330 --> 04:06.915
Do I wanna ask you what you mean by that?

04:06.916 --> 04:09.501
All this optimism

04:09.585 --> 04:11.669
All this booming and soaring.

04:11.670 --> 04:16.716
Things happen like...
bang! This! And that! Simultaneous.

04:16.716 --> 04:19.844
I put out my hand
and what do I feel?

04:21.180 --> 04:25.058
I know there are a thousand things
that you analyze every 10 minutes

04:25.059 --> 04:30.438
patterns, ratio, indexes,
whole maps of information.

04:31.607 --> 04:33.358
I love information.

04:34.485 --> 04:36.903
Eric, this is our
sweetness and light.

04:36.904 --> 04:39.364
It is a fuckall wonder

04:39.365 --> 04:41.866
and we have meaning
in this world

04:42.743 --> 04:47.831
people eat and sleep in
the shadow of what we do.

04:49.124 --> 04:50.959
But at the same time

04:50.960 --> 04:53.044
What?

04:57.424 --> 05:01.553
Any special reason we're in
the car instead of the office?

05:01.554 --> 05:03.638
What makes you think we're
in the car instead of the office?

05:03.806 --> 05:05.515
If I answer that question...

05:05.599 --> 05:06.641
Based on what premise?

05:06.642 --> 05:11.521
I know I'll say something
that's half-way clever, but...also shallow

05:11.522 --> 05:14.357
and probably inaccurate on some level

05:14.358 --> 05:17.902
and then you will pity me
for having been born.

05:17.903 --> 05:19.988
We're in the car 'cause
I need a haircut.

05:19.989 --> 05:22.490
Get the barber come to the
office, get a haircut there

05:22.491 --> 05:25.243
or have the barber come
to your car, just...

05:25.244 --> 05:27.829
get your haircut and
go to the office.

05:27.997 --> 05:31.666
A haircut has what?
Associations

05:31.667 --> 05:34.210
Calendar on the wall,
mirrors everywhere.

05:34.211 --> 05:38.214
There's no barber chair here.
Nothing swivels but chair your in, Shiner.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.445
Where's your car?

06:02.072 --> 06:05.408
We can't seem to find it.

06:05.409 --> 06:07.160
I'd offer you a ride.

06:07.161 --> 06:10.246
I couldn't. Absolutely.

06:10.247 --> 06:12.332
I know you work enroute.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.751
and I like taxis.

06:14.752 --> 06:20.089
I was never good at geography and I
learned things by asking the drivers where they come from.

06:20.090 --> 06:22.759
They come from horror and despair.

06:23.511 --> 06:25.261
Yes, exactly.

06:25.971 --> 06:30.767
One learns about the country where
unrest is occurring by riding the taxis here.

06:32.561 --> 06:34.729
I haven't seen you in a while.

06:38.275 --> 06:40.818
I looked for you this morning.

06:42.738 --> 06:44.280
Your eyes are blue.

06:45.324 --> 06:47.158
Have you eat breakfast yet?

06:47.910 --> 06:49.244
No.

06:51.080 --> 06:54.249
Good. I'm hungry for
something thick and chewy.

06:55.584 --> 06:58.002
You never told me you were blue eyed.

06:59.129 --> 07:01.130
When are we going to talk about?

07:02.633 --> 07:04.634
I want a heliboard on the roof.

07:05.177 --> 07:08.388
I've acquired the air rights,
but we still need the zoning variants.

07:08.389 --> 07:09.806
Don't you wanna eat?

07:10.474 --> 07:13.017
There's a shooting range
next to the elevator bank.

07:14.687 --> 07:16.354
Let's talk about us.

07:16.689 --> 07:18.022
You and I?

07:18.274 --> 07:20.441
We're here so we might as well.

07:21.610 --> 07:23.027
When are we going
to have sex again?

07:24.989 --> 07:27.156
We will, I promise.

07:28.534 --> 07:30.368
We haven't in a while now.

07:31.579 --> 07:33.788
When I work, you see...

07:34.039 --> 07:36.207
the energy is precious.

07:36.208 --> 07:38.293
When you write?

07:38.294 --> 07:40.378
Yes.

07:41.714 --> 07:43.256
Where do you do this?

07:43.591 --> 07:45.341
I look for you, Elise.

07:45.968 --> 07:47.886
I curl up somewhere.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.513
I've always done this.

07:50.639 --> 07:53.141
My mother used to send
people to find me

07:53.434 --> 07:57.061
maids and gardeners,
combing the house and rounds

07:57.563 --> 08:00.273
She thought I was
dissolvable in water.

08:00.983 --> 08:03.276
I like your mother.

08:03.986 --> 08:05.987
You have your mother's breasts.

08:06.322 --> 08:08.072
Breasts?

08:10.326 --> 08:12.660
Great stand-up tits.

08:15.039 --> 08:17.624
Tell me this: where will you go now?

08:18.334 --> 08:21.044
To a meeting somewhere
to your office?

08:21.045 --> 08:22.837
Where is your office?

08:22.838 --> 08:24.923
What do you do, exactly?

08:25.841 --> 08:28.343
You know things,
I think this is what you do.

08:29.053 --> 08:31.346
I think you're dedicated to knowing.

08:31.597 --> 08:37.268
I think you acquire information and turn it
into something stupendous and awful.

08:38.479 --> 08:41.438
You're a dangerous person.
Do you agree?

08:42.691 --> 08:44.359
A visionary.

08:55.663 --> 08:57.956
A report from the Complex.

08:57.957 --> 09:00.041
It's a credible threat,
not to be dismissed.

09:00.751 --> 09:03.002
Which means riding cross town is...

09:03.003 --> 09:05.880
Had numerous threats, all credible.

09:05.881 --> 09:07.465
I'm still standing here.

09:07.758 --> 09:10.635
Not a threat to your safety, to his.

09:11.303 --> 09:13.054
Who the fuck is "his"?

09:13.055 --> 09:16.683
The president's.
This means a ride cross town...

09:16.684 --> 09:20.353
does not happen unless we make
a day of it, with cookies and milk.

09:21.480 --> 09:25.942
Do people still shoot at presidents?
I thought there were more stimulating targets.

09:27.194 --> 09:32.198
In the next block, there are two
haircutting saloons, there's one and two.

09:32.783 --> 09:35.034
No need to go cross town

09:35.661 --> 09:38.079
Situation is unstable.

09:39.206 --> 09:40.915
Here.

09:44.420 --> 09:46.296
I know that smile, Michael.

09:46.297 --> 09:51.676
I think the yuan...I mean there's
reason to believe we may be leveraging too rashly.

09:51.677 --> 09:53.178
It's gonna turn our way.

09:53.179 --> 09:56.014
Yes, I know, it always has.

09:57.266 --> 09:59.434
The rashness you think you see.

09:59.435 --> 10:02.103
What is happening doesn't chart.

10:03.439 --> 10:05.064
It charts.

10:05.065 --> 10:11.529
You just have to search a little harder.
Don't trust standard models, think outside the limits.

10:11.947 --> 10:13.615
The yuan is making a statement.

10:13.616 --> 10:15.408
Read it and leap.

10:15.409 --> 10:18.745
We are betting big time here.

10:18.913 --> 10:23.750
I know that smile and I wanna respect it,
but the yuan can't go any higher.

10:23.751 --> 10:25.210
I wanna trust it.

10:25.336 --> 10:27.837
We're borrowing enormous enormous sums.

10:27.838 --> 10:30.757
Any assault on the borders of
perception is gonna seem rash at first...

10:30.758 --> 10:33.927
Yeah, come on, we're speculating into the void!

10:34.970 --> 10:37.263
Your mother blamed the
smile on your father

10:37.681 --> 10:39.349
he blamed her

10:39.850 --> 10:41.643
there's something deadly about it

10:42.019 --> 10:44.229
she thought she had to enroll
you in special counseling.

10:44.230 --> 10:46.564
I think we ought to adjust.

10:49.985 --> 10:51.277
Where's Shiner?

10:51.278 --> 10:53.363
On his way to the airport.

10:55.241 --> 10:57.283
Why are they called airports?

10:57.576 --> 11:01.663
I know I can't answer these questions
without losing your respect.

11:01.914 --> 11:04.207
Shiner told me our network is secure.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.500
Then it is.

11:06.669 --> 11:09.796
Safe from penetrations.

11:13.133 --> 11:16.344
Why am I seeing things that
haven't happened yet?

11:23.227 --> 11:24.686
How old are you?

11:29.441 --> 11:30.859
What? 22!

11:30.860 --> 11:32.944
You look younger.

11:33.946 --> 11:37.824
I was always younger than anyone
around me. One day I began to change.

11:38.868 --> 11:40.952
I don't feel younger.

11:41.412 --> 11:43.955
I feel located totally nowhere.

11:45.082 --> 11:48.501
Think I'm ready to quit,
basically the business.

11:48.961 --> 11:52.463
Put a stick of gum in your
mouth and try not to chew it.

11:56.051 --> 12:01.139
For someone your age and your gifts, there's only one
thing in the world worth pursuing both professionally and intellectually.

12:01.140 --> 12:03.224
What is it, Michael?

12:04.518 --> 12:07.228
The interaction between
technology and capital

12:07.229 --> 12:09.314
the inseparability.

12:09.648 --> 12:12.358
Highschool was the last true challenge.

12:14.069 --> 12:18.323
There's a poem I read in which
a rat becomes the unit of currency.

12:18.824 --> 12:21.618
Yes, that would be interesting.

12:21.619 --> 12:23.453
Yeah, that would
impact the world economy.

12:23.454 --> 12:26.372
The name alone,
better than the dong or the kwacha.

12:26.373 --> 12:27.582
The name says everything.

12:27.583 --> 12:28.374
Yes.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.334
The rat.

12:29.335 --> 12:32.128
Yes, the rat close lower
today against the euro.

12:32.129 --> 12:36.007
Yes, there's going concern that
the Russian rat will be devalued.

12:36.008 --> 12:37.759
White rats, think about that.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.052
Yes, pregnant rats.

12:39.053 --> 12:41.846
Major sell-offs of
Russian pregnant rats.

12:41.847 --> 12:43.598
Britain converts the rat.

12:43.599 --> 12:45.433
Joins trend to universal currency.

12:45.434 --> 12:47.227
Yes, US is establishing
the rat standard.

12:47.228 --> 12:50.188
Is every US dollar
redeemable for rat?

12:51.273 --> 12:53.149
Dead rats!

12:53.275 --> 12:56.027
Yes, stockpiling of dead rats called

12:56.320 --> 12:58.530
global health menace.

13:00.157 --> 13:04.869
How old are you, now that
you're not younger than everyone else?

13:43.158 --> 13:44.868
Was I expecting you?

13:45.744 --> 13:47.328
Just passing by.

13:47.621 --> 13:51.833
Thought you'd drop in, did you?
That's nice. I'm glad.

13:52.334 --> 13:54.502
Been a while.

13:58.465 --> 13:59.966
I read about it.

13:59.967 --> 14:03.845
Of course. Or did I see it on TV?

14:04.847 --> 14:05.930
What?

14:05.931 --> 14:09.058
What? The wedding!

14:09.226 --> 14:11.352
Strange you didn't tell me.

14:12.271 --> 14:13.563
It's not so strange.

14:13.564 --> 14:15.607
Not so strange?

14:15.608 --> 14:18.526
Two great fortunes!

14:18.527 --> 14:24.616
Like one of those great arranged
marriages of old empire Europe.

14:25.034 --> 14:28.578
Except I'm a world citizen with
a New York pair of balls.

14:29.538 --> 14:33.333
So how many billions together
do you two represent?

14:34.043 --> 14:35.752
She's a poet.

14:38.464 --> 14:40.715
Is that what she is?

14:41.759 --> 14:44.219
I thought she was a Shifrin.

14:44.220 --> 14:45.553
Little of both.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.647
So rich and crisp.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.817
Does she let you touch
her personal parts?

15:01.820 --> 15:04.322
You look gorgeous today.

15:04.323 --> 15:10.578
For someone who's 41 and
finally understands what her problem is.

15:10.579 --> 15:12.038
What's that?

15:12.665 --> 15:14.999
Life is...

15:16.126 --> 15:18.503
too contemporary.

15:20.589 --> 15:22.549
So how old is your consort?

15:26.262 --> 15:28.429
Nevermind, I don't wanna know.

15:30.391 --> 15:32.267
You'd tell me to shut up.

15:32.268 --> 15:34.352
Oh, one more question.

15:34.854 --> 15:36.771
Is she good in bed?

15:39.066 --> 15:41.609
Is she good in the limo?

15:41.610 --> 15:43.152
I don't know yet.

15:43.153 --> 15:46.948
Aww, that's the trouble
will old money.

15:47.449 --> 15:49.826
Now tell me to shut up.

15:52.371 --> 15:54.539
I know something you wanna know.

15:55.541 --> 15:57.083
What's that?

15:57.084 --> 16:01.629
There's a Rothko in private 
hands that I have the privileged knowledge of.

16:01.630 --> 16:03.715
It's about to become available.

16:03.716 --> 16:05.800
You've seen it?

16:07.261 --> 16:10.138
Three, four years ago, yes.

16:10.139 --> 16:12.223
It is...

16:13.726 --> 16:16.311
luminous.

16:16.312 --> 16:18.188
What about the chapel?

16:18.397 --> 16:19.898
What about it?

16:19.899 --> 16:21.733
I've been thinking about the chapel.

16:21.734 --> 16:23.568
You can't buy the god-damn chapel.

16:23.569 --> 16:24.611
How do you know?

16:24.612 --> 16:26.487
Contact the principals.

16:26.488 --> 16:29.991
I thought you'd be thrilled
about the painting. One painting.

16:29.992 --> 16:34.913
You don't have a important Rothko
and you've always want one, we've talked about this!

16:34.955 --> 16:36.998
How many paintings in this chapel?

16:38.876 --> 16:40.919
I don't know.

16:41.504 --> 16:43.004
14? 15?

16:44.131 --> 16:46.799
If they're selling the chapel,
I'll keep it intact.

16:46.800 --> 16:47.800
Tell them!

16:49.136 --> 16:51.596
Keep it intact? Where?

16:51.597 --> 16:53.681
Tell them!

16:54.433 --> 16:59.354
In my apartment there's
sufficient space.

16:59.980 --> 17:02.065
I can make more space.

17:02.066 --> 17:03.691
The people need to see it.

17:03.692 --> 17:05.068
Let them buy it.

17:05.069 --> 17:07.153
Let them outbid me.

17:07.363 --> 17:13.701
Forgive the pissed way to say this,
but the ??? chapel belongs to the world.

17:13.702 --> 17:15.787
It's mine if I buy it.

17:17.373 --> 17:18.705
How much do they want for it?

17:18.707 --> 17:22.167
They don't wanna sell the chapel

17:22.169 --> 17:30.802
and I don't wanna give you lessons in self-denial and social
responsibility because I don't believe for a second you're as cruel as you sound.

17:32.096 --> 17:33.555
How much?

17:39.728 --> 17:42.814
What does it mean to spend money?

17:43.732 --> 17:44.899
A dollar?

17:44.900 --> 17:46.985
A million?

17:46.986 --> 17:48.194
For a painting?

17:48.195 --> 17:50.280
For anything.

17:52.241 --> 17:54.784
I have two private
elevators now.

17:55.327 --> 17:58.496
One is programmed to play
Satie piano pieces.

17:58.497 --> 18:00.582
And move at one-quarter the normal speed.

18:01.292 --> 18:05.170
This is right the Satie and this is the
elevator I take when I'm in a certain...

18:05.671 --> 18:07.005
let's say...

18:07.548 --> 18:09.132
unsettled mood.

18:09.133 --> 18:11.509
It calms me, makes me whole.

18:11.927 --> 18:13.803
Who's the other elevator?

18:13.804 --> 18:15.013
Brother Fez.

18:15.014 --> 18:16.014
Who's that?

18:16.015 --> 18:18.099
The Sufi rap star.
You don't know this?

18:18.100 --> 18:20.185
I miss things.

18:20.686 --> 18:22.812
I don't know what
money is anymore.

18:23.898 --> 18:25.607
I'm losing money
by the ton today.

18:25.608 --> 18:27.442
Many millions.

18:27.443 --> 18:29.110
Betting against the yuan.

18:29.111 --> 18:30.528
Isn't the yuan asleep?

18:30.529 --> 18:32.614
Currency markets never close.

18:32.615 --> 18:37.243
Shanghai runs day and night,
all the major exchanges, seven days a week.

18:37.620 --> 18:38.703
I miss that.

18:42.082 --> 18:43.416
I ???

18:48.714 --> 18:50.548
How many millions?

18:52.092 --> 18:53.676
Hundreds of millions.

18:55.387 --> 18:56.638
How old are you?

18:58.224 --> 18:59.265
28?

19:00.434 --> 19:01.351
28.

19:02.978 --> 19:05.396
I want you to go to the chapel
and make them an offer.

19:06.315 --> 19:07.899
Whatever it takes.

19:08.651 --> 19:10.193
I want everything that's there.

19:10.194 --> 19:12.278
Walls and all.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.908
I remember what you told me once.

19:17.284 --> 19:18.076
What's that?

19:19.745 --> 19:21.830
Talent is more
erotic when it's wasted.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.457
What did I mean?

19:30.172 --> 19:31.130
A word?

19:31.465 --> 19:32.382
Yeah.

19:33.008 --> 19:35.260
Complex recommends extra security.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.404
- You're not happy about this.
- No.

19:37.405 --> 19:38.596
First, a threat
at the president.

19:38.597 --> 19:40.682
You're confident you can
handle whatever it comes up?

19:40.683 --> 19:43.935
Now an attack on the managing
director of the International Monetary Fund.

19:45.062 --> 19:45.895
Arthur Rapp?

19:45.896 --> 19:47.939
Arthur Rapp, yes.

19:47.940 --> 19:48.582
Where?

19:48.732 --> 19:51.693
Nike, North Korea, while being
interviewed on television.

19:52.486 --> 19:54.195
It's on all the channels.

19:54.738 --> 19:58.032
<i>Director Rapp, will this
change your policy on the yuan?</i>

19:58.284 --> 20:02.162
<i>The yuan is uncharacteristically
inflated, which makes it unstable</i>

20:02.163 --> 20:05.123
<i>and eventually it will drop,
and when it...</i>

20:16.218 --> 20:17.302
The Complex...

20:20.097 --> 20:22.182
accept their recommendation.

20:22.183 --> 20:24.267
Good.

20:46.373 --> 20:50.793
All these limos, my God,
that you can't tell one from another.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.004
We could be kids on prom night.

20:53.506 --> 20:55.840
Or some dumb wedding wherever.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.551
What's the charm of identical?

20:58.636 --> 21:03.681
That I'm a powerful person that
chooses not to demarcate his territory with

21:03.682 --> 21:06.142
singular driblets of piss, is what?

21:06.143 --> 21:08.228
Something I need to apologize for?

21:08.229 --> 21:10.980
I want to go home and
tongue-kiss my Maxima.

21:11.857 --> 21:13.358
You now what today is?

21:13.359 --> 21:14.484
Incidentally...

21:14.485 --> 21:16.861
- I know.
- It's my day off, dammit!

21:16.862 --> 21:17.654
I know this.

21:17.655 --> 21:19.697
I need this extra day, desperately.

21:19.698 --> 21:20.406
I know this.

21:20.407 --> 21:21.616
But you don't know this.

21:21.659 --> 21:25.870
You can't know what it's like,
I am a single struggling mother.

21:25.871 --> 21:27.872
We have a situation here.

21:27.873 --> 21:33.044
I am a mother running in the
park when my phone explodes in my navel

21:33.045 --> 21:37.590
I think it's the kid's nanny who
never calls unless the kid's fever reaches 105.

21:37.591 --> 21:39.676
But it's the situation, it....

21:39.677 --> 21:44.472
we have a situation alright,
we have a yuan carry that can crush us in hours.

21:44.974 --> 21:47.475
Take some water.
Sit on the banquette.

21:48.352 --> 21:50.186
I like face to face.

21:50.813 --> 21:53.815
And I don't need to look at all
those screens, I know what's happening.

21:53.816 --> 21:55.316
The yuan will fall.

21:55.317 --> 21:56.734
That's right.

21:56.735 --> 21:58.570
Consumer's spending down.

21:58.571 --> 21:59.904
That's right.

21:59.905 --> 22:03.491
Besides, the Bank of China
left the interest rates unchanged.

22:04.493 --> 22:05.910
This happened today?

22:06.036 --> 22:10.039
This happened tonight in Shanghai,
I called the source at Shenzhen.

22:10.040 --> 22:10.874
While running?

22:10.875 --> 22:14.794
While flinging my body down
Maddison Avenue, to get here on time.

22:15.671 --> 22:17.547
The yuan can't go any higher.

22:17.548 --> 22:21.009
That's true, that's right.
Except it just did.

22:24.597 --> 22:26.139
Hadn't sleep last night.

22:45.242 --> 22:46.201
There's a time limit.

22:47.244 --> 22:47.952
Doctor Ingram?

22:47.953 --> 22:48.912
Who the fuck are you?

22:48.913 --> 22:50.997
Doctor Ingram.

22:50.998 --> 22:52.415
Where's Doctor Nevius?

22:52.416 --> 22:54.501
Called away suddenly.
A personal matter.

22:54.502 --> 22:57.045
Speak slowly and clearly.

22:57.713 --> 23:01.508
Called away suddenly,
I don' know, a family crisis...

23:01.509 --> 23:04.552
I'm the associate, I...I...

23:04.553 --> 23:07.138
flushed out your ear holes once.

23:11.101 --> 23:12.685
You do this why?

23:12.686 --> 23:14.145
What?

23:14.688 --> 23:16.231
Everyday.

23:16.232 --> 23:18.066
No matter...?

23:18.067 --> 23:20.151
Wherever I am, that's right.

23:20.528 --> 23:21.402
No matter.

23:34.333 --> 23:38.169
So you do what?
Same routine every day?

23:38.170 --> 23:39.504
Varies.

23:39.505 --> 23:40.922
Depending.

23:40.923 --> 23:43.007
So he comes to your house

23:43.008 --> 23:45.093
Nice!

23:45.094 --> 23:46.094
On weekends.

23:46.095 --> 23:49.764
We die, Jane, on weekends. People.

23:49.765 --> 23:51.057
It happens.

23:51.684 --> 23:52.809
You're right.

23:53.435 --> 23:55.186
I didn't think of that.

23:55.187 --> 23:57.272
We die because it's the weekend.

23:58.399 --> 24:02.151
I thought we were moving,
but we're not anymore.

24:02.695 --> 24:04.362
The president's in town.

24:04.363 --> 24:05.446
You're right.

24:05.781 --> 24:08.158
I forgot. I though I've
seen him when I ran out of the park.

24:08.367 --> 24:12.370
There's an entourage of limousines
going down 5th with a motorcycle escort.

24:12.371 --> 24:17.375
I thought all these limos are for the president,
I can understand, but it was for somebody famous's funeral.

24:19.128 --> 24:20.628
We die everyday.

24:30.931 --> 24:32.307
What do we do about this?

24:35.060 --> 24:36.603
Let it express itself.

24:36.604 --> 24:38.688
What? Do nothing?

24:38.689 --> 24:40.773
Let it express itself.

24:42.818 --> 24:44.444
You can stand up now.

24:47.239 --> 24:50.575
So, look, we have two rumors
working on our favor.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.369
First, there's the bankruptcies
for six straight months.

24:53.370 --> 24:55.455
More each month, more on the way.

24:55.456 --> 24:57.540
Large Chinese corporations.

24:57.541 --> 24:58.416
This is good.

24:59.001 --> 25:00.084
The yuan will drop.

25:00.085 --> 25:02.795
This is loss of faith.
It will force the yuan to drop.

25:02.796 --> 25:04.255
Dollar will settle up.

25:04.256 --> 25:06.883
The yuan will drop. Where's Chin?

25:06.967 --> 25:09.135
Working on visual patterns.

25:09.386 --> 25:11.221
This thing doesn't chart.

25:11.222 --> 25:12.096
It charts.

25:12.097 --> 25:14.933
It doesn't chart the way
you chart technology stocks

25:14.934 --> 25:20.313
you can find real patterns there,
locate predicting components, this is different.

25:21.315 --> 25:23.650
We're teaching him to see.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.737
You should do the seeing,
you're the seer.

25:28.447 --> 25:32.534
What is he? He's a kid.
He's got a streak in his hair, he's got the earing...

25:32.535 --> 25:34.202
He doesn't have the earing.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.413
If he was any dreamy,
we'd have to put him on life support.

25:38.415 --> 25:39.874
What's the second rumor?

25:40.501 --> 25:43.878
There's a rumor, it seems,
involving the Finance minister

25:43.879 --> 25:47.048
some kind of scandal
about a misconstrued comment

25:47.132 --> 25:51.302
He made a comment about the economy
that may have been misconstrued.

25:51.554 --> 25:56.266
The whole country is now analyzing
the grammar and syntax of this comment.

25:57.142 --> 26:00.186
Or it wasn't even what he said,
it was when he paused.

26:00.688 --> 26:03.356
They're trying to construe
the meaning of the pause.

26:04.984 --> 26:08.152
It may be deeper
even than grammar.

26:08.821 --> 26:10.405
He may be breathing.

26:11.282 --> 26:15.118
So the whole economy convulses
because the man took a breath.

26:19.206 --> 26:21.124
You gripped the water bottle.

26:22.793 --> 26:25.003
Yes, it's that soft type plastic.

26:25.004 --> 26:26.504
You grip it.

26:27.047 --> 26:28.590
You choke it.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.676
It's a matter of fact thing.

26:32.344 --> 26:33.845
It's sexual tension.

26:33.846 --> 26:35.597
It's every day
nervousness in a life.

26:35.598 --> 26:37.682
It's sexual tension.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.268
Days like these...

26:46.066 --> 26:47.108
What?

26:49.278 --> 26:53.531
That whole sad business of
Judeo-Christian jogging. You were not born to run.

26:53.532 --> 26:55.283
I look at you. I know what you are.

26:55.284 --> 26:57.744
Your sloppy body, smelly and wet

26:57.745 --> 27:03.124
a woman who was born to stay strapped in a
chair, while a man tells her how much she excites him.

27:04.126 --> 27:07.045
How come we've never
spend this kind of time together?

27:15.930 --> 27:18.389
Your prostate is asymmetrical.

27:57.096 --> 27:59.681
Those two, they're ours?

28:01.809 --> 28:03.142
I felt the need

28:04.436 --> 28:06.312
imperative, that we reroute.

28:06.522 --> 28:08.022
The situation is what?

28:08.023 --> 28:08.982
This.

28:08.983 --> 28:13.903
Water main break, we have flood
conditions ahead. State of chaos.

28:14.154 --> 28:18.992
This. The question of the president
and his whereabouts. He is fluid. He is moving.

28:18.993 --> 28:24.122
Wherever he goes, our satellite receiver reports
a ripple effect in the traffic that causes mass paralysis.

28:24.123 --> 28:25.415
This also.

28:25.416 --> 28:29.961
There's a funeral proceeding slowly
downtown and now deflecting westward.

28:29.962 --> 28:33.673
Many vehicles, numerous mourners on foot.
And finally this.

28:33.924 --> 28:36.634
We have a report of imminent
activity in the area.

28:37.386 --> 28:38.636
Activity?

28:38.637 --> 28:39.679
Imminent.

28:40.222 --> 28:42.515
Nature is yet unknown.

28:43.350 --> 28:45.643
Complex says "use caution".

29:30.856 --> 29:32.273
Recite to me.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.028
Where's your necktie?

29:37.321 --> 29:39.113
I had my checkout.

29:39.114 --> 29:41.199
Saw my heart on the screen.

29:44.370 --> 29:46.329
I don't like saying this.

29:46.330 --> 29:48.414
But?

29:49.041 --> 29:50.959
You smell of sex.

29:51.293 --> 29:53.378
That's my doctor's
appointment you smell.

29:53.379 --> 29:55.463
I smell sex all over you.

29:55.714 --> 29:57.549
It's what?

29:59.552 --> 30:01.177
It's hungry you smell.

30:02.012 --> 30:03.888
I wanna eat lunch.

30:04.306 --> 30:06.182
You wanna eat lunch.

30:06.851 --> 30:08.726
We're people in the world.

30:09.562 --> 30:11.396
We need to eat and talk.

30:15.860 --> 30:18.236
I'm not sure how hungry I am.

30:18.237 --> 30:20.321
Eat. You'll find out.

30:21.365 --> 30:23.116
Speaking of sex.

30:23.117 --> 30:27.245
We've been married only weeks.
Barely weeks.

30:27.246 --> 30:30.957
Everything is barely weeks.
We have minutes to live.

30:31.417 --> 30:36.754
We don't want to start counting the times, do we?
And having solemn discussions on the subject.

30:36.755 --> 30:38.423
No, we wanna do it.

30:38.424 --> 30:42.260
And we will.
We shall.

30:42.761 --> 30:44.345
We wanna have it.

30:44.680 --> 30:47.098
Sex.

30:47.099 --> 30:49.184
Yes.

30:49.185 --> 30:52.061
Because there isn'time
not to have it.

30:52.062 --> 30:57.275
Time is a thing that grows scarcer every day.
What, you don't know this?

30:57.276 --> 31:00.778
I like that bookshop.
Do you know why?

31:00.779 --> 31:03.948
Because it's semi-underground.

31:03.991 --> 31:07.535
You feel hidden.
You like to hide.

31:07.828 --> 31:09.621
From what?

31:09.622 --> 31:11.706
Sometimes only noise.

31:12.917 --> 31:18.213
You're one of those silent
wistful children, glued to the shadows.

31:18.464 --> 31:19.964
And you?

31:19.965 --> 31:22.050
I don't know.
I don't think about it.

31:22.635 --> 31:25.595
Think about one thing
and tell me what it was.

31:26.138 --> 31:28.306
Alright, one thing.

31:28.974 --> 31:33.853
When I was four, I figured out how
much I weight on each of the planets in the Solar System.

31:34.063 --> 31:38.608
That's nice.
I like that.

31:39.235 --> 31:42.946
Such science and ego combined.

31:44.323 --> 31:46.366
When are we going to the lake?

31:46.367 --> 31:47.909
Fuck the lake.

31:47.910 --> 31:52.580
I thought we like it there
after all the planning,
the construction.

31:52.623 --> 31:56.417
To get away, to be alone together.
It's quiet at the lake.

31:56.418 --> 31:58.086
It's quiet in town.

31:59.213 --> 32:05.176
The way we live, yes, I suppose.
High enough, far enough.

32:05.886 --> 32:07.637
What about your car?

32:07.638 --> 32:09.722
Not so quiet, surely.

32:09.932 --> 32:12.016
You spend a lot of time there.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.102
I had the car prousted.

32:15.104 --> 32:16.771
Yes?

32:17.940 --> 32:20.567
The way they build a stretch is this:

32:20.568 --> 32:25.530
Take a vehicle base unit cut in half
with a huge throbbing saw device.

32:25.739 --> 32:30.285
And they add a segment to lengthen
the chassis by ten, elven, twelve feet.

32:30.369 --> 32:33.872
Whatever desired dimension.
Twenty-two feet, if you like.

32:34.415 --> 32:38.042
While they did this to my car,
I sent the word that they had to proust is.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.753
Cork-line it against street noise.

32:41.213 --> 32:43.965
It's lovely, actually.
I love that.

32:45.050 --> 32:49.596
The vehicles are armored, of course.
This complicated the cork-lining.

32:49.805 --> 32:52.140
But they managed in the end.

32:53.475 --> 32:57.270
It's a gesture.
A thing a man does.

32:57.313 --> 32:58.646
Did it work?

32:58.647 --> 33:00.440
How could it work, no!

33:00.441 --> 33:04.819
This city eats and sleeps noise.
Makes noise out of every century.

33:04.820 --> 33:09.908
Makes the same noises that were made in the seventeen century,
along with other noises that where developed since then.

33:09.909 --> 33:11.075
No.

33:11.494 --> 33:15.955
But I don't mind the noise.
The noise energizes me.

33:16.707 --> 33:19.334
Important thing is that it's there.

33:19.335 --> 33:20.960
Cork?

33:20.961 --> 33:23.046
That's right. The cork.

33:24.715 --> 33:27.258
This is what finally matters.

33:34.350 --> 33:36.100
Is this what I wanted?

33:37.019 --> 33:38.603
Tell me what you wanted.

33:38.604 --> 33:41.564
Duck consommé
with an herb twist.

33:43.484 --> 33:48.154
It's true, you know.
You do actually reek of sexual discharge.

33:50.783 --> 33:56.246
It's not the sex you think I've had.
It's the sex I want, that's what you smell on me.

33:56.539 --> 33:59.457
'Cause the more I look at you,
the more I know about us both.

33:59.458 --> 34:01.543
Tell me what that means.

34:01.877 --> 34:04.462
Or don't.
No, don't.

34:04.505 --> 34:06.548
And the more I wanna
have sex with you.

34:06.841 --> 34:09.884
Because that's a certain kind of sex
that has an element of cleansing.

34:09.885 --> 34:14.097
It's the antidote to disillusion.
The counter-poison.

34:16.141 --> 34:21.145
You need to be inflamed, don't you?
This is your element.

34:21.146 --> 34:24.983
Where are you going after the bookstore?
Because there's a hotel.

34:24.984 --> 34:27.068
I was going to the bookstore. Period.

34:27.360 --> 34:30.737
I was in the bookstore,
I was happy there.

34:31.739 --> 34:33.616
Where were you going?

34:33.617 --> 34:35.702
To get a haircut.

34:37.246 --> 34:38.663
Do you need a haircut?

34:38.664 --> 34:40.748
I need anything you can give me.

34:40.748 --> 34:42.583
Be nice.

34:43.793 --> 34:46.920
I need all the meanings
of the inflamed.

34:47.255 --> 34:50.592
There's a hotel just across the avenue.
We can start over.

34:50.592 --> 34:53.386
Or finish with intense feeling,
that's one of the meanings.

34:53.387 --> 34:57.515
To arouse a passionate feeling.
We can finish what we barely started.

34:57.850 --> 35:00.476
Two hotels, in fact.
We have a choice.

35:01.145 --> 35:03.188
I don't think I want to pursue this.

35:03.981 --> 35:06.024
No, you don't.
You wouldn't.

35:08.277 --> 35:10.111
Be nice to me.

35:18.954 --> 35:21.664
A specter is haunting the world!
A specter is haunting the world!

35:23.751 --> 35:26.878
A specter is haunting the world!

35:39.475 --> 35:44.687
We want to think about the art of money-making.
The greeks have a word for it.

35:44.980 --> 35:49.734
Chrimatistikos.
But we have to give the word a little leeway.

35:49.735 --> 35:54.656
Adapt it to the current situation.
Because money has taken a turn.

35:55.074 --> 36:00.578
All wealth has become wealth for its own sake.
There's no other kind of enormous wealth.

36:00.871 --> 36:05.834
Money has lost its narrative quality,
the way painting did once upon a time.

36:05.835 --> 36:08.586
Money is talking to itself.

36:09.171 --> 36:13.967
I want this car, which I love.
The glow of the screens.

36:14.009 --> 36:15.718
I love the screens.

36:15.719 --> 36:19.597
The glow of cyber-capital.
So radiant and seductive.

36:19.849 --> 36:21.933
I understand none of this.

36:22.226 --> 36:26.229
Does it ever stop? Does it slow down?

36:26.230 --> 36:27.814
Of course not.

36:28.065 --> 36:31.109
Why should it?
It's fantastic.

36:31.735 --> 36:36.447
But you know how shameless I am in
the presence of anything that calls itself an idea.

36:36.615 --> 36:41.119
The idea is time.
Living in the future.

36:41.370 --> 36:45.665
Look at those numbers running.
Money makes time.

36:45.666 --> 36:50.628
It used to be the other way around.
Clock time accelerated the rise of the capitalism.

36:50.629 --> 36:54.716
People stopped thinking about eternity
and began to concentrate on hours.

36:54.717 --> 36:59.137
Measurable hours, man hours,
using labor more efficiently.

36:59.138 --> 37:01.222
It's cyber-capital
that created the future.

37:02.224 --> 37:05.143
What is the measurement
called a nanosecond?

37:05.394 --> 37:07.145
Ten to the minus nine power.

37:07.146 --> 37:09.689
- What?
- One billionth of a second.

37:09.690 --> 37:11.232
I understand none of it.

37:11.233 --> 37:16.196
But it tells me how rigorous we need to be in order
to take adequate measure of the world around us.

37:16.197 --> 37:17.822
There are zeptoseconds.

37:17.823 --> 37:19.491
Good, I'm glad.

37:19.492 --> 37:22.785
Yoctoseconds.
One septilionth of a second.

37:23.162 --> 37:28.875
Because time is a corporate asset now.
It belongs to the free market system.

37:28.876 --> 37:30.960
The present is harder to find.

37:30.961 --> 37:36.925
It is being sucked out of the world to make way
for the future of uncontrolled markets and huge investment potentials.

37:37.676 --> 37:40.136
The future becomes insistent.

37:41.347 --> 37:45.099
This is why something will happen soon.
Maybe today.

37:45.100 --> 37:50.355
To correct the acceleration of time
and bring nature back to normal, more or less.

38:30.145 --> 38:32.564
You have to understand.

38:32.857 --> 38:36.943
The more visionary the idea,
the more people it leaves behind.

38:36.944 --> 38:39.612
This is what the protest is all about.

38:39.613 --> 38:46.911
Visions of technology and wealth, the force of the cyber-capital
that will send people to the gutter to retch and die.

38:46.912 --> 38:49.455
What is the flaw of
human rationality?

38:50.499 --> 38:51.541
What?

38:51.542 --> 38:55.962
It pretends not to see the horror and death
at the end of the scheme it builds.

38:55.963 --> 38:58.423
This is a protest against the future.

38:58.424 --> 39:03.511
They want to hold off the future. They want
to normalize it, keep it from overwhelming the present.

39:03.512 --> 39:08.349
The future is always a wholeness,
a sameness, we're all tall and happy there.

39:08.392 --> 39:14.022
This is why the future fails.
It can never be the cruel happy place we want to make it.

39:14.023 --> 39:18.026
What would happen if they'd knew 
the head of Packer Capital was in the car?

39:18.027 --> 39:20.820
We know what the anarchist have always said.

39:20.821 --> 39:21.946
Yes.

39:21.947 --> 39:23.072
Tell me.

39:23.073 --> 39:26.659
The urge to destroy
is a creative thing.

39:26.660 --> 39:31.873
This is also a hallmark of capitalist thought.
Enforced destruction.

39:31.874 --> 39:37.629
Old industries have to be harshly eliminated.
New markets have to be forcibly claimed

39:37.630 --> 39:40.924
and old markets have to be re-exploited.

39:40.925 --> 39:44.928
Destroy the past. Make the future.

39:53.145 --> 39:58.608
This is the thing about genius.
Genius alters the terms of its habitat.

39:58.609 --> 40:03.863
Technology is crucial the civilization, why?
Because it helps us to make our fate.

40:03.864 --> 40:07.992
We don't need God, or miracles
or flight of the bumblebee

40:07.993 --> 40:12.914
but it is also crouched and undecidable
It can go either way.

40:14.083 --> 40:18.920
You've been talking about the
future being impatient, pressing upon us.

40:18.921 --> 40:24.425
That was theory. I am your
chief of theory, I deal in theory.

40:52.538 --> 40:54.622
It's not original.

40:57.126 --> 40:58.918
What's original?

40:59.420 --> 41:01.004
He did it, didn't he?

41:01.005 --> 41:03.089
It's an inappropriation.

41:04.717 --> 41:07.635
He poured the gasoline
and lit the match.

41:08.095 --> 41:14.642
All those Vietnamese monks
one after another in all their lotus positions.

41:16.437 --> 41:18.396
Imagine the pain.

41:19.064 --> 41:20.815
Sit there, feel it.

41:20.816 --> 41:23.860
Immolating themselves endlessly.

41:24.820 --> 41:26.946
To say something.

41:28.407 --> 41:30.867
To make people think.

41:30.868 --> 41:33.411
It's not original.

41:42.379 --> 41:43.338
Just now.

41:43.339 --> 41:44.172
What?

41:44.465 --> 41:47.300
A report from the Complex,
concerns of your safety.

41:48.093 --> 41:49.302
A little late, aren't they?

41:49.303 --> 41:51.638
This is specific and catergorical.

41:51.639 --> 41:52.680
There's been a threat, then.

41:52.681 --> 41:56.476
Assessment, credible red.
Highest order of urgency.

41:56.644 --> 41:59.354
An incursion is
already in progress.

41:59.355 --> 42:00.855
Now we know.

42:00.856 --> 42:02.941
Now we have to act
now on what we know.

42:03.818 --> 42:06.194
But we still want
what we want.

42:07.196 --> 42:08.530
We want a haircut.

42:13.911 --> 42:15.620
It's interesting,
isn't it?

42:17.164 --> 42:19.457
About men and immortality.

42:20.626 --> 42:25.755
You live in a tower that soars to heaven
and goes unpunished by God.

42:26.298 --> 42:28.341
And you bought an airplane.

42:29.343 --> 42:31.135
I've nearly forgotten this.

42:31.637 --> 42:33.972
Soviet or ex-soviet.

42:34.765 --> 42:39.185
A strategic bomber, capable
of knocking out a small city.

42:39.603 --> 42:41.104
Is this right?

42:41.689 --> 42:46.568
It's an old Tu-160.
NATO calls it Blackjack A.

42:46.819 --> 42:52.031
It was deployed around 1988,
carries nuclear bombs and cruise missiles.

42:52.032 --> 42:54.117
This were not included in the deal.

42:55.703 --> 42:58.997
And they wouldn't let you fly it.
Could you fly it?

42:59.665 --> 43:01.332
Could and did.

43:02.251 --> 43:04.294
They wouldn't let me fly it armed.

43:04.295 --> 43:05.587
Who didn't?

43:05.588 --> 43:07.422
State Department.

43:08.007 --> 43:12.427
The Pentagon, The Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

43:12.428 --> 43:13.970
The Russians?

43:13.971 --> 43:19.934
What Russians? I've bought it black market and dirt cheap
from a Belgian arms dealer in Kazakhstan.

43:19.935 --> 43:24.147
That's where I took the controls,
for half hour, over the desert.

43:24.148 --> 43:26.232
US Dollars, 31 million.

43:27.026 --> 43:28.610
Where is it now?

43:28.611 --> 43:34.616
Parked in a storage facility in Arizona,
waiting for replacement parts that nobody can find.

43:35.201 --> 43:36.701
Sitting in the wind.

43:37.870 --> 43:40.205
I go out there now and then.

43:40.206 --> 43:42.290
To do what?

43:42.708 --> 43:44.542
To look at it.

43:45.377 --> 43:46.961
It's mine.

43:51.175 --> 43:53.301
People will not die.

43:53.844 --> 43:56.846
Isn't this the creed
of a new culture?

43:58.224 --> 44:02.268
People will be absorbed
in streams of information.

44:02.686 --> 44:04.354
I know nothing
about that.

44:05.648 --> 44:07.774
Computers will die.

44:08.818 --> 44:11.402
They're dying in
their present form.

44:12.071 --> 44:14.989
They're just about dead
as distinct units.

44:15.783 --> 44:20.829
A box, a screen,
a keyboard...

44:21.497 --> 44:24.666
they're melting into
texture of every day life.

44:25.584 --> 44:27.252
Is this true or not?

44:27.253 --> 44:29.170
Even the word "computer".

44:29.171 --> 44:32.715
Even the word "computer"
sounds backward and dumb.

44:55.239 --> 44:57.115
You work out?

44:57.283 --> 44:58.825
Six percent body fat.

44:58.826 --> 45:01.578
Used to be my number.
Then I got lazy.

45:04.874 --> 45:06.708
What are you gonna do about it?

45:06.709 --> 45:11.671
Hit the machines in the morning and
run in the park at night.

45:14.967 --> 45:16.801
Where is he now?

45:17.261 --> 45:18.469
Who?

45:20.472 --> 45:23.600
You know.

45:23.601 --> 45:26.269
He's in the lobby. Torval.

45:26.896 --> 45:29.397
He's watching them
come and go.

45:30.024 --> 45:34.027
Danko's in the
hall outside.

45:34.028 --> 45:36.112
Who's that?

45:36.113 --> 45:38.198
Danko, my partner.

45:41.744 --> 45:43.661
He's new.

45:43.662 --> 45:47.999
I'm new. He's been watching
your back for sometime now.

45:48.792 --> 45:52.170
??? after these wars in the Balkans.
He's a veteran.

45:55.925 --> 45:58.551
What's he gonna
say to you about this?

46:00.095 --> 46:03.765
Torval.
That's who you're talking about?

46:05.017 --> 46:06.768
Say his name.

46:06.769 --> 46:08.853
What's he gonna say to you?

46:09.188 --> 46:13.775
Just so you're safe.
That's the job.

46:16.862 --> 46:20.657
Men get possessive.
What, you don't know this?

46:20.658 --> 46:22.742
I heard the rumor.

46:23.118 --> 46:27.163
Fact is, I technically speaking
went off-duty an hour ago, so...

46:28.123 --> 46:31.668
Basically, my time
we're dealing with here.

46:54.733 --> 46:56.734
Do you find this interesting?

46:56.735 --> 46:58.069
What?

46:59.155 --> 47:01.739
Protecting someone in danger.

47:02.783 --> 47:06.244
What makes you willing to do this?
Take this risk.

47:06.620 --> 47:08.037
Maybe you're worth it.

47:11.041 --> 47:14.836
Maybe it's just the pay.
It's pretty good.

47:17.339 --> 47:19.174
The risk?

47:20.176 --> 47:21.926
I don't think about the risk.

47:22.344 --> 47:26.306
You're the man in the crosshairs,
I figure the risk is yours.

47:27.850 --> 47:29.601
But is it interesting?

47:30.519 --> 47:33.855
It's interesting to be near
men somebody wants to kill.

47:38.068 --> 47:40.778
You know what they say,
don't you?

47:43.282 --> 47:46.910
The logical extension
of business is murder.

47:48.496 --> 47:50.413
Move little left.

47:50.789 --> 47:53.124
Move little left.

47:57.630 --> 48:00.882
Nice.
Perfect.

48:02.843 --> 48:05.094
What kind of weapon
did he give you?

48:06.555 --> 48:07.889
Tazer.

48:20.736 --> 48:23.530
He doesn't trust me
yet with deadly force.

48:28.911 --> 48:30.954
How many volts at your disposal?

48:31.539 --> 48:33.039
Hundred thousand.

48:33.582 --> 48:35.542
Jams your nervous system.

48:36.585 --> 48:40.338
Drop you to your knees.
Like this.

48:47.012 --> 48:48.096
Stun me.

48:49.598 --> 48:54.853
I mean it.
I want you to do it, Kendra,
show how it feels like.

48:55.563 --> 48:57.564
I'm looking for more.

48:58.607 --> 49:00.692
Show me something
I don't know.

49:01.443 --> 49:05.780
Stun me to my DNA. Come on, do it!
Click the switch!

49:05.781 --> 49:09.409
Aim and fire.
I want all the voltage the weapon holds.

49:09.785 --> 49:12.954
Do it!
Shoot it!

49:14.456 --> 49:15.832
Now.

49:46.238 --> 49:48.198
I need to know
where you're going.

49:48.199 --> 49:50.283
Wait and learn.

49:57.750 --> 49:59.584
You smoke since when?

50:01.295 --> 50:03.838
I took it up when
I was fifteen.

50:04.924 --> 50:11.804
It's one of those things a girl takes up.
It tells her she's more than a skinny body nobody looks at.

50:12.181 --> 50:14.891
There's a certain
drama in her life.

50:15.768 --> 50:20.271
She notices herself.
Then other people notice her.

50:20.898 --> 50:24.692
Then she marries one of them.
Then, they go to dinner.

50:28.030 --> 50:31.032
You're wearing a cocktail dress.

50:32.284 --> 50:33.451
Yes?

50:34.495 --> 50:36.412
It's navy blue.

50:36.831 --> 50:38.122
Yes.

50:40.042 --> 50:43.461
And that's your...
silver jewelery.

50:45.256 --> 50:46.840
Yes, it is.

50:47.508 --> 50:48.925
I'm noticing.

50:49.802 --> 50:51.010
How was the play?

50:52.388 --> 50:54.806
I left at intermission,
didn't I?

50:55.850 --> 50:57.851
What was it about
and who was in it?

50:57.852 --> 50:59.936
I'm making conversation.

51:01.730 --> 51:04.149
I went on impulse.

51:04.650 --> 51:06.568
The audience was sparse.

51:06.569 --> 51:10.488
Five minutes after the
curtains went up, I understood why.

51:11.157 --> 51:13.158
Where is your jacket?

51:16.036 --> 51:17.745
Where's my jacket?

51:17.746 --> 51:19.831
You were wearing a suit jacket earlier.

51:21.167 --> 51:23.084
Where is your jacket?

51:25.129 --> 51:28.756
Lost in the scuffle, I guess.
You saw the car.

51:29.133 --> 51:30.842
We were under attack by anarchists.

51:30.843 --> 51:35.013
Just two hours ago, there were major
global protests. Now, what, forgotten.

51:36.432 --> 51:38.766
Something else I wish I could forget.

51:38.767 --> 51:40.852
That's my peanuts you smell.

51:42.563 --> 51:47.692
Didn't I see you come out the hotel up the
street while I was standing outside the theater?

51:48.777 --> 51:51.529
Is that the hotel
you wanted to take me to?

51:52.406 --> 51:53.948
We don't need a hotel.

51:54.241 --> 51:55.658
We'll do it in the ladies room.

51:55.826 --> 51:58.828
We'll go to the alley out back,
rattle a garbage can. Look...

51:58.829 --> 52:02.373
I'm trying to make contact
in the most ordinary ways.

52:02.374 --> 52:05.710
To see and hear.
To notice your mood.

52:05.711 --> 52:07.212
Your clothes.

52:07.213 --> 52:08.379
This is important.

52:08.380 --> 52:11.466
Are your stocking on straight?
I understand this at some level.

52:11.467 --> 52:13.551
How people look...

52:13.552 --> 52:14.802
what people wear.

52:14.803 --> 52:16.888
How they smell.

52:16.889 --> 52:18.973
Do you mind my saying that?

52:19.975 --> 52:22.227
Am I being too wifely?

52:23.395 --> 52:25.563
I'll tell you
what the problem is.

52:26.398 --> 52:28.274
I don't know how
to be indifferent.

52:29.068 --> 52:31.194
I can't master this.

52:31.570 --> 52:34.155
And it makes me 
usceptible to pain.

52:35.783 --> 52:38.034
In other words, it hurts.

52:40.746 --> 52:42.247
This is good.

52:43.290 --> 52:44.791
We like people talking.

52:44.792 --> 52:46.417
Isn't this how they talk?

52:46.418 --> 52:48.503
How would I know?

52:49.255 --> 52:51.464
My prostate is asymmetrical.

52:51.465 --> 52:53.550
What does that mean?

52:53.801 --> 52:56.010
I don't know.

52:56.929 --> 52:58.388
You have to see a doctor.

52:58.389 --> 53:00.765
I just saw a doctor.
I see a doctor every day.

53:00.850 --> 53:02.851
You just saw a doctor.

53:03.602 --> 53:04.936
That's how I know.

53:10.442 --> 53:16.698
Packer Capital portfolio is being reduced to
near nothingness in the course of a day.

53:17.867 --> 53:22.996
My personal fortune in the tens of billions
is in ruinous convergence with this fact.

53:23.497 --> 53:26.082
And there's been a
credible threat at my life.

53:27.251 --> 53:28.585
It's OK.

53:28.878 --> 53:30.628
It's fine.

53:31.046 --> 53:33.798
Makes me feel free in
a way I've never known.

53:33.799 --> 53:37.969
That's so awful.
Don't say things like that.

53:38.762 --> 53:42.891
Free to do what?
Go broke and die?

53:45.728 --> 53:51.149
Listen to me, I'll help you financially.
I'll truly do what I can to help.

53:51.942 --> 53:56.321
You can reestablish yourself.
At your pace, in your way.

53:57.239 --> 53:59.699
Tell me what you need
and I promise I'll help.

54:00.951 --> 54:06.706
But as a couple, as a marriage,
I think we're done, aren't we?

54:08.292 --> 54:13.046
You speak of being free.
This is your lucky day.

54:31.106 --> 54:35.652
This is very crazy.
Take over whole theater.

54:35.861 --> 54:38.738
What do you think?

54:39.615 --> 54:41.616
I don't know

54:41.617 --> 54:45.829
I don't know either.
But I think it is crazy.

54:46.622 --> 54:49.874
Looks like drug scene.
What do you think?

54:50.209 --> 54:51.960
Yes.

54:52.503 --> 54:58.091
I think it is latest drug.
Called novo.

54:58.092 --> 55:00.802
Makes pain go away.

55:01.971 --> 55:04.597
Look how good they feel.

55:07.309 --> 55:08.810
Kids.

55:09.395 --> 55:12.438
They are kids, exactly.

55:13.816 --> 55:19.779
What pain do they feel that they
need to take pill? Music?

55:21.407 --> 55:24.784
Too loud. So what?

55:26.078 --> 55:28.830
It is beautiful how they dance.

55:31.292 --> 55:35.503
What pain do they feel
too young to buy beer?

55:36.755 --> 55:39.883
There's pain enough
for everybody now.

55:39.884 --> 55:42.886
I don't believe I'm here.

55:43.846 --> 55:47.557
You tell me when we leave.
I'll take you out.

55:48.517 --> 55:50.685
Where is he?

55:51.103 --> 55:56.608
At the entrance.
Torval?

55:56.609 --> 55:59.360
He watches the entrance.

56:02.573 --> 56:05.366
Do you kill people?

56:05.367 --> 56:08.077
What do you think?

56:11.373 --> 56:13.084
Like lunch.

56:17.546 --> 56:18.713
What do we know?

56:18.714 --> 56:20.798
We know it's not a coup.

56:20.799 --> 56:25.345
It's not an organized terror cell or
international kidnappers with ransom demands.

56:25.346 --> 56:27.430
It's an individual.

56:28.140 --> 56:29.307
Do we care?

56:29.308 --> 56:32.852
We don't have a name.
But we have a phone call.

56:32.937 --> 56:35.063
The Complex is analyzing
the voice data.

56:35.064 --> 56:39.567
It made certain assessments. They're projecting
a course of action on the part of the individual.

56:39.985 --> 56:42.487
Why can't I work up any
curiosity on the subject?

56:43.572 --> 56:45.573
Because it
doesn't matter.

56:45.866 --> 56:50.119
Whoever it is.
That's who it is.

56:54.500 --> 56:55.667
Eric.

57:05.094 --> 57:06.469
Why we're here?

57:06.846 --> 57:08.555
You ain't heard?

57:08.806 --> 57:09.681
What?

57:09.682 --> 57:11.766
Brother Fez.

57:13.185 --> 57:14.227
What?

57:15.855 --> 57:17.313
Dead.

57:18.524 --> 57:20.984
No!
What? Can't be!

57:20.985 --> 57:23.945
Dead. Died. Earlier today.

57:25.447 --> 57:26.906
I don't know this.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.535
Funeral has been
in progress all day...

57:30.870 --> 57:34.080
The family wanted the city
to have a chance to pay respect.

57:35.124 --> 57:39.127
Record label wanted an
exploitation event. Big and loud.

57:39.253 --> 57:42.297
Street to street.
Right through the night.

57:44.216 --> 57:45.800
I don't know this.

57:46.260 --> 57:50.889
How can this be? I love his music.
I have his music in my elevator.

57:52.016 --> 57:54.350
I know the man.
What, they've shot him?

57:54.351 --> 57:58.021
Fez've been having cardiac
problems for years. Since highschool.

57:58.731 --> 58:01.399
Been seeing specialists,
been seeing faith healers.

58:02.276 --> 58:04.194
The heart just wore out.

58:04.653 --> 58:06.696
This ain't a thug down some alley.

58:06.697 --> 58:10.742
The man never been breathalyzed,
barely, since he was seventeen.

58:12.286 --> 58:14.287
Hope you're not disappointed.

58:15.080 --> 58:15.914
Disappointed?

58:15.915 --> 58:18.291
That our man here wasn't shot!

58:18.501 --> 58:20.376
Hope he didn't let you down.

58:20.544 --> 58:23.671
Natural causes,
now that's a let-down.

58:29.595 --> 58:31.429
What happened to your stretch?

58:31.972 --> 58:34.682
Let a fine machine degrade in public.

58:35.726 --> 58:37.435
That's scandal, man.

58:38.437 --> 58:40.355
Everything's a scandal.

58:40.898 --> 58:43.525
Dying's a scandal,
but we all do it.

58:44.026 --> 58:46.236
I think I'm hearing
voices in the night.

58:46.237 --> 58:49.572
Because I can't
believe you're saying this.

59:11.387 --> 59:13.555
Ask me: do I love this shit?

59:13.639 --> 59:19.102
Me being big as I am and a retro-nigger.
I have to love what I'm seeing.

59:19.103 --> 59:23.231
Because this is something I can never dream
of doing in my thinnest day on Earth.

59:23.607 --> 59:26.234
He liked having the clergy nearby.

59:26.485 --> 59:31.406
He showed up in my office once with an imam
and two white boys from Utah in suits.

59:33.200 --> 59:37.078
He was always excusing
himself so he could pray.

59:38.247 --> 59:41.457
He lived in a minaret,
for a while, in Los Angeles.

59:42.334 --> 59:44.335
Yeah, I heard that.

59:46.547 --> 59:49.257
I went to visit him once.

59:50.509 --> 59:52.677
He built it next
to his house.

59:53.512 --> 59:56.514
He moved out of his house
and into the minaret.

01:01:31.902 --> 01:01:34.445
I'm after you long time.

01:01:34.947 --> 01:01:38.533
Son of a bitch.
I glop you good.

01:01:40.536 --> 01:01:47.125
Today you are cremed by the master
Andre Petrescu. The pastry assassin.

01:01:47.543 --> 01:01:51.713
This is my mission worldwide to sabotage
power and wealth.

01:01:53.674 --> 01:01:58.803
For years, I'm waiting for this.
Freshly baked only, you know.

01:02:00.264 --> 01:02:05.018
I passed up the president of the United
States to make the strike.

01:02:07.563 --> 01:02:15.069
I can creme him anytime,
but you are major statement.

01:02:15.488 --> 01:02:17.864
Very hard to zero in.

01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:39.427
You lack of humor, Mr. Packer.

01:02:39.428 --> 01:02:46.267
You live up your reputation, okay, but I've been kicked and
beaten by the security so many times I'm walking dead.

01:02:46.268 --> 01:02:50.522
You know they put me a radio collar
when I was in England, to save the Queen.

01:02:50.523 --> 01:02:52.607
They tracked me like a rare crane.

01:02:53.859 --> 01:02:56.027
But please, believe one thing.

01:02:56.028 --> 01:03:01.533
I cremed Fidel three times
when he was in Bucharest years ago.

01:03:01.534 --> 01:03:05.912
I am an action painter of cremed pies.

01:03:05.913 --> 01:03:07.664
I...

01:03:07.665 --> 01:03:13.002
Dropped from a tree on Michael Jordan one time.
This was the famous Flying Pie.

01:03:13.045 --> 01:03:17.006
Museum quality.
Video for the ages.

01:03:17.007 --> 01:03:22.971
I quiched the fucking
sultan of Brunei in his bath.

01:03:22.972 --> 01:03:28.393
They put me in black hole until
I was screaming for my eyes.

01:03:31.647 --> 01:03:34.274
Okay, let's go.

01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:02.594
Do you play?

01:04:04.889 --> 01:04:07.348
Not really my game.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:11.936
Rugby...
Now that was my game.

01:04:13.105 --> 01:04:14.898
You play?

01:04:16.066 --> 01:04:17.942
Some.

01:04:19.904 --> 01:04:22.489
I like the action and the pain.

01:04:23.866 --> 01:04:25.575
Pump iron now.

01:04:27.244 --> 01:04:31.331
Of course you understand.
There's still someone tracking you.

01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:34.459
Still someone out there.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:38.004
This was a petty incursion.

01:04:38.297 --> 01:04:42.967
The whipped cream.
Technically irrelevant.

01:04:43.886 --> 01:04:45.595
I understand.

01:04:45.596 --> 01:04:48.723
Next time, no pies and cake.

01:04:49.308 --> 01:04:51.684
Dessert...is over.

01:04:52.478 --> 01:04:58.107
Yeah, he's out there.
And he's armed.

01:05:01.779 --> 01:05:04.030
He's armed and you're armed.

01:05:04.532 --> 01:05:06.407
This is true.

01:05:07.535 --> 01:05:09.619
You'll have to draw your weapon.

01:05:10.871 --> 01:05:12.497
This is true.

01:05:16.001 --> 01:05:18.336
Let me see the thing.

01:05:18.671 --> 01:05:21.297
Let you see the thing?

01:05:23.926 --> 01:05:25.343
Okay.

01:05:25.344 --> 01:05:29.889
Why not, you paid for it, right?

01:05:31.475 --> 01:05:34.352
Manufactured in Austria.

01:05:35.396 --> 01:05:37.188
Nice.

01:05:37.857 --> 01:05:40.859
Smart tool.
Scary smart.

01:05:42.486 --> 01:05:44.362
Voice recognition.

01:05:44.363 --> 01:05:46.447
That's right.

01:05:47.783 --> 01:05:50.493
You, what, you speak and
it knows your voice?

01:05:50.494 --> 01:05:52.078
That's right.

01:05:52.454 --> 01:05:57.667
The mechanism doesn't activate unless
the voice print matches the stored data.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:00.670
Only my voice matches.

01:06:03.632 --> 01:06:06.176
You have to speak German
before it fires?

01:06:06.927 --> 01:06:10.513
No, but the voice is
only half the operation.

01:06:12.766 --> 01:06:14.642
You're saying there's a code as well.

01:06:14.643 --> 01:06:17.645
Preprogrammed spoken code.

01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:20.899
What is it?

01:06:26.322 --> 01:06:29.574
Nancy Babich.

01:07:09.073 --> 01:07:10.782
We are here.

01:07:51.198 --> 01:07:54.909
But how come you're such
a stranger lately?

01:07:55.286 --> 01:07:56.995
Hello, Anthony.

01:07:59.582 --> 01:08:01.583
Long time.

01:08:02.251 --> 01:08:03.668
Long time.

01:08:03.878 --> 01:08:05.753
I need a haircut.

01:08:05.754 --> 01:08:07.839
You look like what?

01:08:08.757 --> 01:08:10.466
Get in here
so I can look at you

01:08:18.725 --> 01:08:22.395
Never seen such ratty hair on a human.

01:08:24.314 --> 01:08:26.858
I woke up this morning
and knew it was time.

01:08:26.859 --> 01:08:28.943
You knew where to come.

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:34.698
Said to myself:
"I want a haircut".

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.368
Maybe you wanna eat something first.

01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:40.662
I could eat something.

01:08:40.872 --> 01:08:46.294
I have takeout in the fridge that
I nibble at it when I get the urge.

01:08:59.975 --> 01:09:03.478
So, you married that woman?

01:09:04.313 --> 01:09:05.354
That's right.

01:09:05.481 --> 01:09:10.484
That her family has got like money
unbeknownst.

01:09:11.362 --> 01:09:15.948
Never thought you'd get married so young, but...
what do I know?

01:09:17.243 --> 01:09:23.832
I have chickpeas all mashed up and
eggplants with rice and nuts.

01:09:24.082 --> 01:09:26.751
- Give me the eggplants.
- Yeah. Good.

01:09:28.379 --> 01:09:32.006
You father did not tell
your mother until he had to.

01:09:32.591 --> 01:09:37.554
He went fast once they found it.
He was diagnosed and then he went.

01:09:37.846 --> 01:09:40.723
You were four years old.

01:09:41.267 --> 01:09:42.183
Five.

01:09:42.184 --> 01:09:43.893
Exactly.

01:09:43.894 --> 01:09:45.310
And you?

01:09:45.938 --> 01:09:47.479
You're keeping well?

01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:51.943
You know me kid.
I could tell you I can't complain.

01:09:51.944 --> 01:09:57.949
But I could definitely complain.
The thing is, I don't want to.

01:09:58.450 --> 01:10:01.578
Let me thing what I have
that we could drink.

01:10:01.912 --> 01:10:09.961
Water from the tap, I drink water now.
I have a bottle of liqueur that's been there don't ask how long.

01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:12.297
I could drink some of that.

01:10:12.298 --> 01:10:18.136
Because if your father himself walked in here
and I offered him tap water

01:10:18.137 --> 01:10:24.225
oh God forbid, he would rip out my last hair.

01:10:24.518 --> 01:10:27.562
Maybe we could ask my driver to come in
my driver is outside in the car.

01:10:27.563 --> 01:10:31.816
Oh, we could give him the other eggplants.

01:10:36.947 --> 01:10:41.784
I drove a checkered
cab. Big. Bouncy.

01:10:42.119 --> 01:10:47.665
I drove nights. I was young.
What could they do to me?

01:10:47.666 --> 01:10:50.084
Night is not so good if you have
a wife and child.

01:10:50.085 --> 01:10:54.464
Besides, I can tell you, it was crazy enough
in the daytime.

01:10:54.465 --> 01:10:56.549
I loved my cab.

01:10:57.384 --> 01:11:04.182
I drove twelve hours non-stop.
I stopped only to pee.

01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:09.854
A man is hit one day by another taxi.
Comes flying into my taxi.

01:11:09.855 --> 01:11:13.274
I mean, he was flying in the air,
crashed against the windscreen.

01:11:13.275 --> 01:11:17.278
Right there in my face.
Blood is everywhere.

01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:21.866
I never left my garage without my Windex.

01:11:22.409 --> 01:11:25.703
I am Acting Secretary of
External Affairs in a previous life.

01:11:25.704 --> 01:11:31.417
I said to him. Get off from there.
I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.

01:11:31.418 --> 01:11:37.173
I ate at the wheel.
I kept my sandwiches in tinfoil.

01:11:37.466 --> 01:11:41.719
I ate at the wheel also.
I could not afford to stop driving.

01:11:44.348 --> 01:11:49.435
Where did you pee, Ibrahim?
I peed under the Manhattan Bridge.

01:11:49.645 --> 01:11:51.563
This is where I peed exactly.

01:11:51.564 --> 01:11:56.985
I peed in parks and alleys.
I peed in the pet cemetery once.

01:11:57.903 --> 01:12:02.282
Night is better in some ways,
I am certain of it.

01:12:05.661 --> 01:12:11.207
I was here, what?
Probably four hours a day.

01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:16.629
Helping my father cut hair. Nights,
I drove my cab. I loved my cab.

01:12:18.174 --> 01:12:24.387
I had a little fan that worked on battery,
because air conditioning

01:12:24.388 --> 01:12:28.349
forget about it in that day and age.
And then, I had a drinking cup

01:12:28.559 --> 01:12:32.228
with a magnet that I stuck on the dashboard.

01:12:32.771 --> 01:12:39.694
I had my steering wheel upholstered, very nice, in zebra.
And my daughter, with her photograph on the visor.

01:12:40.112 --> 01:12:43.156
I give this guy his first haircut.

01:12:44.074 --> 01:12:47.327
He didn't want to sit in the car seat.

01:12:47.495 --> 01:12:54.125
His father tried to jam him in there.
He was going "no, no, no, no!"

01:12:54.710 --> 01:12:59.756
So I put him right where you're sitting now.
His father pinned him down.

01:12:59.757 --> 01:13:05.887
I cut his father hair when he was a kid.
Yeah, I cut his hair.

01:13:07.973 --> 01:13:14.479
Where is the chief of security in this situation?
I realized he's not with us.

01:13:14.688 --> 01:13:16.564
We are alone.

01:13:18.067 --> 01:13:20.735
I gave him the rest of the night off.

01:13:21.821 --> 01:13:25.490
You have protection, right, in the car?

01:13:26.158 --> 01:13:27.283
Protection?

01:13:27.284 --> 01:13:30.620
Protection.
You know what that means?

01:13:31.121 --> 01:13:32.622
I had a gun, but
I threw it away.

01:13:32.623 --> 01:13:34.332
But why?

01:13:37.294 --> 01:13:40.880
I didn't want to make plans.
I wasn't thinking ahead.

01:13:40.881 --> 01:13:42.966
Didn't want to take precautions.

01:13:43.008 --> 01:13:45.510
You know how that sounds?
How does it sound?

01:13:45.594 --> 01:13:48.346
I thought you were some kind of big shot

01:13:48.347 --> 01:13:54.310
that destroyed people in a blink of an eye.
But you sound pretty iffy to me.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.524
This is Mike Packer's kid that had
a gun and threw it away?

01:13:59.859 --> 01:14:01.192
What is that?

01:14:01.193 --> 01:14:02.777
Yes, what is that?

01:14:02.778 --> 01:14:06.114
Yeah. In this part of town
and you had a gun

01:14:06.615 --> 01:14:09.117
There are steps you must
to take to save-guard yourself.

01:14:09.118 --> 01:14:11.202
In this part of town

01:14:11.203 --> 01:14:16.040
you cannot walk five meters after dark,
you'd be careless. They'd kill you straight away.

01:14:16.041 --> 01:14:21.129
You'd be reasonable with them?
They'll take a little longer, tear out your entrails first.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.429
What happened to your eye that got all twisted that way?

01:14:31.182 --> 01:14:37.395
I can see. I can drive.
I passed their tests.

01:14:40.024 --> 01:14:42.400
You were beaten and tortured.

01:14:42.735 --> 01:14:44.486
An army coup.

01:14:44.987 --> 01:14:46.571
By the secret police.

01:14:47.239 --> 01:14:52.076
Or they thought they executed you.
Fired a shot to your face.

01:14:52.077 --> 01:14:54.162
Left you for dead.

01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:01.920
I loved my cab.
I gulped my food.

01:15:02.505 --> 01:15:09.511
I drove twelve hours straight night after night.
Vacations? Forget about.

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:13.139
But what did I do for protection?

01:15:40.459 --> 01:15:42.377
I need to leave.

01:15:42.419 --> 01:15:43.711
How come?

01:15:46.549 --> 01:15:48.675
I don't know how come.

01:15:48.884 --> 01:15:50.301
That's how come.

01:15:50.302 --> 01:15:53.805
But let me do the left side, at least.
So both sides are equal.

01:15:53.848 --> 01:15:56.766
I'll come back.
Take my work for it.

01:15:56.767 --> 01:16:00.436
I'll sit and you'll finish.

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.911
Ibrahim.
Tell me this.

01:16:16.912 --> 01:16:18.204
Yes.

01:16:21.083 --> 01:16:26.671
These stretched limousines that fill the streets.
I've been wondering.

01:16:26.881 --> 01:16:28.756
Yes?

01:16:32.887 --> 01:16:35.221
Where are they parked at night?

01:16:36.348 --> 01:16:43.688
They need large tracts of space.
Out near the airports or somewhere in the Meadowlands.

01:16:44.106 --> 01:16:48.568
Long Island.
New Jersey.

01:16:48.777 --> 01:16:53.114
I will go to New Jersey.
The limo stays here.

01:16:57.286 --> 01:17:01.414
Next block there would be an
underground garage. Limos only.

01:17:01.499 --> 01:17:07.712
I would drop off your car, pick up my car
then drive home, through the stinking tunnel.

01:17:43.749 --> 01:17:48.461
Early in the morning, you could see, right here
teams of men in white coveralls

01:17:48.462 --> 01:17:54.592
they are washing limousines.
A marketplace of limos, rags flying.

01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:47.645
Eric Michael Packer!

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.198
Nancy Babich.

01:21:25.054 --> 01:21:26.304
What are you doing here?

01:21:26.305 --> 01:21:28.223
That's not the question.

01:21:28.766 --> 01:21:31.976
The question is yours to answer.
Why do you wanna kill me?

01:21:32.978 --> 01:21:36.898
Now, that's not the question.
That's too easy to be the question.

01:21:39.068 --> 01:21:43.321
I want to kill you because I want
to count for something in my whole life.

01:21:45.491 --> 01:21:46.991
See how easy?

01:21:49.787 --> 01:21:54.040
You're not a reflective man.
I live consciously in my head.

01:21:55.668 --> 01:21:57.252
Give me a cigarette.

01:21:57.253 --> 01:21:59.337
Give me a drink.

01:22:00.506 --> 01:22:02.090
Do you recognize me?

01:22:02.091 --> 01:22:04.175
I can't see you clearly.

01:22:05.594 --> 01:22:08.805
Sit.
We'll talk.

01:22:09.932 --> 01:22:10.890
Yes.

01:22:12.059 --> 01:22:13.518
I'd like that.

01:22:19.525 --> 01:22:24.863
Sit and talk.
I've had a long day.

01:22:25.656 --> 01:22:27.782
Things.
People.

01:22:29.118 --> 01:22:33.371
Time for a philosophical pause.
Some reflection.

01:22:33.914 --> 01:22:35.707
Yes.

01:22:42.756 --> 01:22:46.593
You're not familiar with that weapon.
I fired that weapon.

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:50.597
That's a serious weapon.
Whereas this...

01:22:52.808 --> 01:22:56.478
I'm thinking of installing a shooting range
in my apartment.

01:22:57.146 --> 01:23:01.649
Why not your office?
Line them up and shoot them.

01:23:02.568 --> 01:23:06.738
You know the office, is that right?
You've been in the office.

01:23:06.906 --> 01:23:09.073
Tell me who you think I am.

01:23:09.366 --> 01:23:11.409
I don't know who are you.

01:23:25.716 --> 01:23:28.009
Maybe if you'd tell me your name.

01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:30.094
You wouldn't know my name.

01:23:30.304 --> 01:23:34.224
I know names more than faces.
Tell me.

01:23:34.225 --> 01:23:36.309
Benno Levin.

01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:39.979
That's a phony name.
It's phony. It's fake.

01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:42.023
It's fake, it isn't real.

01:23:42.191 --> 01:23:46.236
But I think I recognize you now, you were
at the cash machine out side the bank

01:23:46.237 --> 01:23:48.321
some time around noon.

01:23:50.366 --> 01:23:51.449
You saw me.

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:55.870
You looked familiar.
I didn't know why.

01:23:56.372 --> 01:23:58.623
Maybe you used to work for me.

01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:01.793
Hate me, wanna to kill me. Fine.

01:24:02.586 --> 01:24:06.548
Everything in our lives...
yours and mine

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.468
has brought us to this moment.

01:24:12.096 --> 01:24:13.388
Fine.

01:24:16.809 --> 01:24:21.354
I could use a tall beer
about now.

01:24:23.566 --> 01:24:25.984
How old are you?
I'm interested.

01:24:25.985 --> 01:24:28.319
Do you think people
like me can't happen?

01:24:28.487 --> 01:24:30.864
- How old?
- We happen.

01:24:30.865 --> 01:24:32.115
Forty-one.

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.242
Prime number.

01:24:34.243 --> 01:24:37.036
But...not an interesting one.

01:24:39.456 --> 01:24:44.377
Or did I turn forty-two. It's possible, because
I don't keep track. Because why should I?

01:24:50.342 --> 01:24:53.344
I've become an enigma to myself.

01:24:54.805 --> 01:24:57.515
So said St. Augustine.

01:24:59.018 --> 01:25:01.519
And herein lies my sickness.

01:25:01.645 --> 01:25:06.399
Well, that's a start. It's a crucial self-realization.
I'm not talking about myself.

01:25:07.276 --> 01:25:11.112
I'm talking about you.
Your whole waking life

01:25:11.113 --> 01:25:15.700
is a self-contradiction. That's why you're
engineering your own downfall.

01:25:18.287 --> 01:25:20.705
Why are you here?

01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:24.792
That's the first thing I said to you
when I came out of the toilet.

01:25:25.044 --> 01:25:26.878
I noticed the toilet.

01:25:28.839 --> 01:25:31.382
It's the first thing
I've noticed when I walked in the room.

01:25:38.098 --> 01:25:40.141
What happens to your waste?

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:49.150
There's a...There's a whole below the fixture.
I knocked a hole in the floor

01:25:50.152 --> 01:25:54.197
then I positioned the toilet so that
one hole fits over the other.

01:25:54.698 --> 01:25:58.243
Holes are interesting.
There're books about holes.

01:25:58.244 --> 01:26:02.080
There're books about...
shit.

01:26:03.249 --> 01:26:06.209
But we wanna know why you would willingly

01:26:06.210 --> 01:26:10.463
enter a house where there's someone
inside that's prepared to kill you.

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:14.008
Alright, tell me.
Why am I here?

01:26:14.927 --> 01:26:17.887
You have to tell me.

01:26:21.183 --> 01:26:23.852
Some kind of unexpected failure.

01:26:25.271 --> 01:26:27.897
Shocked your self-esteem.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.655
The yuan.

01:26:36.907 --> 01:26:38.950
I couldn't figure out the yuan.

01:26:44.123 --> 01:26:46.499
The yuan?

01:26:48.878 --> 01:26:51.379
I couldn't chart the yuan.

01:26:54.216 --> 01:26:55.842
The yuan eluded me.

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:59.095
And so you brought everything down.

01:27:01.557 --> 01:27:04.225
This had never happened.

01:27:05.978 --> 01:27:07.562
I've become half-hearted.

01:27:07.563 --> 01:27:10.273
This is because you only have half heart.

01:27:11.317 --> 01:27:13.401
Give me a cigarette.

01:27:14.987 --> 01:27:16.988
I don't smoke cigarettes.

01:27:24.538 --> 01:27:27.207
Huge ambition and contempt...

01:27:27.666 --> 01:27:29.876
I can...

01:27:30.085 --> 01:27:34.589
list the things, name the appetites,
people.

01:27:35.841 --> 01:27:40.261
Mistreat some, ignore some.
Persecute others.

01:27:41.263 --> 01:27:43.598
The self-totality.

01:27:44.391 --> 01:27:46.851
The lack of remorse.

01:27:48.187 --> 01:27:49.854
These are your gifts.

01:27:49.855 --> 01:27:51.940
What else?

01:27:57.696 --> 01:27:59.906
Intuition of early death.

01:28:00.241 --> 01:28:01.366
What else?

01:28:01.742 --> 01:28:03.451
What else...

01:28:06.872 --> 01:28:08.665
Secret doubts.

01:28:10.459 --> 01:28:13.127
Doubts that you
could never acknowledge.

01:28:13.337 --> 01:28:15.213
You know some things.

01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:20.135
I know you smoke cigars.

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:28.351
I know everything that's ever
said or written about you.

01:28:30.396 --> 01:28:32.897
I know what I see in your face

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.734
after years of study.

01:28:37.611 --> 01:28:40.280
You worked for me, doing what?

01:28:45.327 --> 01:28:49.247
Currency analysis.
I worked on the baht.

01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:52.333
The baht is interesting.
I loved the baht!

01:28:52.793 --> 01:28:59.841
But your system is so micro-timed that I couldn't
keep up with it. I couldn't find it. It is so infinitesimal!

01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:04.637
Then I began to hate
my work and you

01:29:04.638 --> 01:29:08.475
and all the numbers on my screen
and every minute of my life.

01:29:08.851 --> 01:29:11.352
One hundred satang to the baht.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:17.192
What's your real name?

01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:19.944
You wouldn't know it.

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:22.030
Tell me your name.

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:27.702
Sheets.
Richard Sheets.

01:29:30.039 --> 01:29:31.706
Means nothing to me.

01:29:34.084 --> 01:29:39.464
Tell me: do you imagine that I stole
ideas from you?

01:29:40.049 --> 01:29:42.884
Intellectual property.
What does anyone imagine?

01:29:43.302 --> 01:29:46.179
A hundreds things a minute.

01:29:48.682 --> 01:29:54.062
Whether I imagine a thing or not,
it's real to me.

01:29:54.063 --> 01:29:57.398
I have syndromes. Where they real?

01:29:59.985 --> 01:30:02.487
From Malaysia, for example.

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:08.576
The things that I believe become facts.
They have the time and space of facts.

01:30:08.577 --> 01:30:11.579
You're forcing me to be reasonable.
I don't like that.

01:30:12.915 --> 01:30:17.210
I have severe anxieties that my sex
organ is receding into my body.

01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:18.211
But it's not.

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:20.296
Shrinking into my abdomen.

01:30:20.297 --> 01:30:21.089
But it's not.

01:30:21.090 --> 01:30:24.259
Either it is or not, I know it.

01:30:26.428 --> 01:30:28.138
Show me.

01:30:31.142 --> 01:30:35.478
I don't have to look.
There are folk beliefs.

01:30:35.646 --> 01:30:41.484
There are epidemics that happen,
men in the thousands in real fear and pain.

01:30:41.485 --> 01:30:44.988
Alright.
Alright.

01:30:46.949 --> 01:30:50.743
People like you can't happen.
I understand this.

01:30:50.953 --> 01:30:55.915
I believe it, but not the violence. No the gun.
The gun is all wrong.

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:58.459
You're not a violent man.

01:30:59.962 --> 01:31:04.507
Violence is meant to be real
based on real motives,

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:10.263
on forces in the world that, what, make us want
to defend ourselves or take aggressive actions.

01:31:10.806 --> 01:31:14.976
The crime you want to commit
is cheap imitation.

01:31:14.977 --> 01:31:20.440
It's a stale fantasy.
People do it because other people do it.

01:31:25.154 --> 01:31:30.158
It's just another syndrome,
it's a thing you caught from others.

01:31:31.702 --> 01:31:36.164
It has no history.
It's all history, the whole thing is history.

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:41.252
You are foully and berserkly rich.

01:31:41.921 --> 01:31:44.798
Don't tell me about
your charities.

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:47.425
I have no charities.

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:52.680
You don't resent the rich,
that's not your sensibility.

01:31:52.681 --> 01:31:54.766
What's my sensibility?

01:31:54.767 --> 01:31:59.270
Confusion!
This is why you're unemployable.
Why?

01:31:59.271 --> 01:32:02.690
Because you wanna kill people.
That's not why I'm unemployable.

01:32:02.691 --> 01:32:06.110
Then why?
Because I stink.

01:32:07.196 --> 01:32:10.782
Smell me!

01:32:10.783 --> 01:32:17.789
Even when you self-destruct, you have to fail
more, lose more, die more, stink more than others.

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:28.299
In...in the old tribes, the chief that destroyed more
property than the other chiefs, was the most powerful.

01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.385
What else?

01:32:30.386 --> 01:32:34.222
You have everything to live for,
I have nothing and neither.

01:32:34.223 --> 01:32:36.724
That's another
reason to kill you.

01:32:36.725 --> 01:32:37.517
Richard!

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:40.228
I want to be known as Benno!

01:32:42.106 --> 01:32:45.733
You're unsettled 'cause you
feel you have no role.

01:32:46.152 --> 01:32:48.111
You have no place.

01:32:50.447 --> 01:32:53.408
But you have to ask yourself
whose fault you that is?

01:32:54.326 --> 01:32:59.497
'Cause, in fact, there's very little in the society
that you have to hate. Think!

01:33:00.666 --> 01:33:02.292
Think.

01:33:05.921 --> 01:33:10.258
Violence...
needs a cause.

01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:12.635
A truth.

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:19.601
There's nothing in
the world but other people.

01:33:22.813 --> 01:33:27.942
I had this thought one day.
It was the thought of my life.

01:33:28.777 --> 01:33:31.070
I'm surrounded by
other people.

01:33:33.532 --> 01:33:39.120
It's "buy and sell". It's "let's have lunch".
I thought "look at them and look at me".

01:33:41.582 --> 01:33:49.964
Light shines through me on the street.
I'm, what's the word, pervious to visible light.

01:33:51.967 --> 01:33:54.886
I thought, "all these other people",
I thought...

01:33:55.805 --> 01:33:58.473
How do they get to be
who they are?

01:34:00.184 --> 01:34:01.059
It's...

01:34:01.894 --> 01:34:08.900
...banks and car parks. It's airline tickets and their
computers. It's...restaurants filled with people

01:34:08.901 --> 01:34:12.946
talking. It's people signing
the merchant copy.

01:34:12.988 --> 01:34:16.533
It's people taking the merchant
copy out of the leather folder

01:34:16.534 --> 01:34:19.327
and then signing it and
separating merchant copy

01:34:19.328 --> 01:34:25.625
If I'm the customer copy and putting the credit
card back in their pocket, this alone could do it.

01:34:27.086 --> 01:34:32.966
It's people who have doctors that order
tests for them. This alone...

01:34:36.595 --> 01:34:41.349
I'm helpless in their system that makes no sense to me.

01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:46.229
You want me to be a helpless robot soldier

01:34:47.106 --> 01:34:50.525
and all I could be was helpless.
o.

01:34:50.526 --> 01:34:55.989
It's women shoes.
It's all the names they have for shoes.

01:34:57.783 --> 01:35:01.536
It's all those people in the park, behind the library.

01:35:04.331 --> 01:35:06.499
Talking in the sun.

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:13.423
Your crime has no conscience.

01:35:14.175 --> 01:35:19.345
You haven't been driven to it by some
oppressive social force.

01:35:19.346 --> 01:35:21.431
I hate to be reasonable.

01:35:24.143 --> 01:35:27.687
You're not against the rich.
Nobody is against the rich.

01:35:28.147 --> 01:35:31.357
Everybody is ten seconds away from being
rich, or so that everybody thought.

01:35:32.151 --> 01:35:33.443
No.

01:35:36.322 --> 01:35:38.656
Your crime is in your head.

01:35:39.658 --> 01:35:47.290
Another fool shooting up a diner because
Bullets flying through the walls. So useless and stupid.

01:35:49.585 --> 01:35:53.505
Even your weapon is a fantasy.
What is it called?

01:35:55.341 --> 01:35:58.551
What are the attachments mounted on the barrel?
What are they called, what do they do?

01:35:58.552 --> 01:36:00.220
Alright.

01:36:01.347 --> 01:36:07.644
I don't have the manhood to know these names. Men
know these names. You have the experience of manhood.

01:36:08.187 --> 01:36:11.981
I can't think that far ahead.

01:36:13.025 --> 01:36:15.985
It's all I can do to be a person.

01:36:20.199 --> 01:36:24.327
Violence needs a burden.

01:36:25.538 --> 01:36:28.081
It needs a purpose.

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.877
What are you doing?

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:37.090
I don't know.

01:36:38.551 --> 01:36:40.301
Maybe nothing.

01:37:13.002 --> 01:37:15.378
My prostate is asymmetrical.

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:19.841
So is mine.

01:37:24.555 --> 01:37:26.681
What does it mean?

01:37:36.358 --> 01:37:41.946
Nothing, it means nothing.
It's harmless. A harmless variation.

01:37:42.031 --> 01:37:46.868
Nothing to worry about.
At your age, why worry?

01:37:49.079 --> 01:37:51.498
You should have listened to your prostate.

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:56.669
You tried to predict movements on the yuan
by drawing on patterns from nature.

01:37:56.670 --> 01:38:00.715
Yes, of course, the mathematical
properties of tree rings.

01:38:01.383 --> 01:38:07.388
Sunflower seeds. The limbs of galactic spirals.
I've learned this with the baht.

01:38:07.389 --> 01:38:12.393
I loved the cross-harmonies between nature
and data. You've taught me this.

01:38:12.394 --> 01:38:17.148
You've made this form of analysis horribly
and sadistically precise.

01:38:17.358 --> 01:38:19.776
But you forgot something along the way?

01:38:19.902 --> 01:38:21.152
What?

01:38:21.278 --> 01:38:26.866
The importance of the lopsided.
The thing that's skewed a little.

01:38:28.327 --> 01:38:30.787
You were looking for balance.

01:38:30.788 --> 01:38:35.083
Beautiful balance, equal parts,
equal sides, I know this.

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:37.669
I know you.

01:38:39.588 --> 01:38:43.967
But you should have been tracking
the yuan in its ticks and quirks.

01:38:44.844 --> 01:38:48.096
A little quirk.
A misshape.

01:38:49.598 --> 01:38:50.598
The misweave.

01:38:50.599 --> 01:38:55.270
That's where the answer was.
In your body, in your prostate.

01:39:04.530 --> 01:39:06.614
But I still have to shoot you.

01:39:12.621 --> 01:39:15.915
Don't you ever walked through the park behind the library

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.129
and see all those people setting in their little chairs
and drinking at those tables

01:39:21.714 --> 01:39:25.967
on the terrace, after work, and hear
their voices mingling in the air

01:39:25.968 --> 01:39:28.636
and want to kill them?

01:39:29.722 --> 01:39:31.055
No.

01:39:33.225 --> 01:39:37.103
I'm having my Korean
panic attack.

01:39:39.982 --> 01:39:45.153
That's from holding
in my anger all those years.

01:39:47.865 --> 01:39:50.033
But not anymore.

01:39:50.409 --> 01:39:53.870
You have to die, no matter what.

01:39:55.372 --> 01:39:59.209
I can tell you my situation
has changed in the course of a day.

01:40:01.545 --> 01:40:09.677
I have my syndromes, you have your complex.
Icarus falling. You did it to yourself!

01:40:11.263 --> 01:40:14.265
Meltdown in the sun.

01:40:14.266 --> 01:40:19.979
You will plunge three and half feet to your death.
It's not very heroic. Is it?

01:40:31.033 --> 01:40:36.287
Even if there's a fungus
between my toes that speaks to me.

01:40:38.332 --> 01:40:43.795
Even if the fungus told me to kill you. Even then, your death
is justified because of where you stand on Earth.

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:47.590
For your apartment and what you paid for it.

01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:52.512
For you daily medical checkups.
This alone...

01:40:54.098 --> 01:40:58.601
Medical checkups,
every day.

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:05.650
For the limousine that displaces the air
that people need to breath in Bangladesh.

01:41:05.693 --> 01:41:07.610
This alone.

01:41:08.904 --> 01:41:10.822
Don't make me laugh.

01:41:12.658 --> 01:41:14.784
Don't make you laugh?

01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:21.666
You just made that up. You've never spend
a minute of your life worrying about other people.

01:41:25.129 --> 01:41:26.546
Alright.

01:41:29.258 --> 01:41:34.304
But the air you breath,
this alone, the thought you have...

01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:41.853
Is there a fungus that
speaks to you? I'm serious.

01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:46.107
People hear things. They hear God.

01:41:55.951 --> 01:42:02.373
Anyway, you're already dead. You look like someone
already dead. Someone dead a hundred years.

01:42:03.834 --> 01:42:06.961
Many centuries dead.
Kings dead.

01:42:08.297 --> 01:42:12.258
Royals in their pajamas
eating mutton.

01:42:15.596 --> 01:42:19.641
Have I ever used the word "mutton" in my life?
Came in my head, out of nowhere.

01:42:19.642 --> 01:42:21.726
Mutton.

01:42:33.531 --> 01:42:38.743
I wanted you to heal me.
Save me.

01:42:41.539 --> 01:42:44.666
I wanted you to save me.

01:43:08.107 --> 01:43:08.707
