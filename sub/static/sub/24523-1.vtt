00:54.469 --> 00:55.972
We have to keep on going.

00:57.706 --> 01:00.040
- They're coming.
- Wait, this isn't right.

01:00.042 --> 01:02.141
- Yes. We have to go north.
- This isn't right.

01:02.143 --> 01:04.544
Yes, it is.
We have to go this way.

01:04.546 --> 01:06.645
Yeah, come on!

01:06.647 --> 01:08.014
Wait, that isn't north!

01:08.016 --> 01:10.484
Come back, wait.

01:10.486 --> 01:12.585
I'm telling you,
the highway's over there.

01:12.587 --> 01:14.954
- No, it's not, it's this way.
- No, you're wrong.

01:14.956 --> 01:18.023
- Come with me, come on.
- Don't touch me, Lloyd.

01:18.025 --> 01:21.561
If you don't come with me, you're dead.
We both are.

01:21.563 --> 01:26.433
You know it. They're going to kill us.
Sacrifice us.

01:26.435 --> 01:27.837
No, they're not.
Not us.

01:30.938 --> 01:32.838
What did you do?

01:32.840 --> 01:35.409
Do you think you tricked me?
You're one of them.

01:35.411 --> 01:36.809
I was just trying
to save us.

01:36.811 --> 01:39.579
- Liar!
- Darby...

01:39.581 --> 01:43.115
the heat, the desert,
it's making you...

01:43.117 --> 01:45.687
Crazy? I'll show you crazy.

02:03.471 --> 02:04.770
Big mistake, bitch.

02:06.174 --> 02:09.443
Come here, rip her tits off.

02:24.126 --> 02:27.497
- I'm not that type of girl.
- What, do you have a penis?

02:32.668 --> 02:34.003
What are you looking at?

02:42.911 --> 02:45.911
Whoo-hoo, party town,
here I come.

02:45.913 --> 02:50.018
- Hey, why aren't you set?
- Where's the fun in that?

02:52.086 --> 02:53.454
Whoo!

02:57.526 --> 03:01.864
Hey. On or off, what's it going to
be, I ain't got all day, sweetie.

03:05.167 --> 03:07.233
- Where you headed?
- Black Rock City.

03:07.235 --> 03:10.203
Where the only limits
are your imagination.

03:10.205 --> 03:11.671
How much?

03:11.673 --> 03:13.273
Money's not accepted
at Burning Man.

03:13.275 --> 03:15.108
Only gifts.

03:15.110 --> 03:16.709
Does that include
free rides?

03:16.711 --> 03:17.943
It does today.

Honey, honey, honey, Burning
Man is not a PG-13 event.

05:47.795 --> 05:50.964
There's going to be
drugs, nudity,

05:50.966 --> 05:55.901
and sex and art and nudity
and music and graphic nudity.

05:55.903 --> 05:57.971
- Guys and girls...
- Wee!

05:57.973 --> 06:00.139
I know what I'm getting
myself into.

06:00.141 --> 06:02.808
And what you're not.

06:02.810 --> 06:06.279
...restrictions,
limits, rules.

06:06.281 --> 06:10.716
Not in the sex dome, I hear, 5,000
sex enthusiasts ready to orgy.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.752
Yeah!

06:12.754 --> 06:15.288
Why do you have
so many clothes on?

06:15.290 --> 06:17.093
Mm.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.309
Whoa!

06:36.911 --> 06:39.114
- Sorry.
- I'm not.

06:40.949 --> 06:42.115
Where are we?

06:42.117 --> 06:44.183
On a party bus,

06:44.185 --> 06:47.887
heading to the Burning Man festival
in Black Rock City, Nevada.

06:47.889 --> 06:51.356
It's a place to be yourself
and become something better.

06:51.358 --> 06:54.426
That sounds fun,
I want to go to there.

06:54.428 --> 06:57.831
Well, you're in luck,
this is my third burn.

06:57.833 --> 07:01.166
I go mostly
for the art exhibits.

07:01.168 --> 07:02.170
Mostly.

07:03.404 --> 07:05.340
Oh, you got something there.

07:06.374 --> 07:09.274
What is it?
A smudge?

07:09.276 --> 07:11.510
No, just the nipple.

07:11.512 --> 07:14.049
A beautiful, perfect nipple.

07:17.252 --> 07:18.918
Didn't anyone
hear me banging?

07:18.920 --> 07:20.786
I've been trapped
in there over an hour.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.288
- With my shirt.
- Huh?

07:22.290 --> 07:25.091
But you gifted it to me.

07:25.093 --> 07:28.394
Unlikely story, pre-vert.

07:28.396 --> 07:31.199

You're beautiful.

08:00.127 --> 08:01.396
Now just lose the top.

08:03.999 --> 08:05.565
Do you think that'd be
a little gratuitous, Jay?

08:05.567 --> 08:08.233
There's no such thing
as gratuitous female nudity.

08:08.235 --> 08:09.803
It's all in your mind.

08:09.805 --> 08:11.904
Pretty sure
it'd be all my body.

08:11.906 --> 08:13.508
Would it help
if I was topless too?

08:16.278 --> 08:17.911
Help!

08:17.913 --> 08:19.314
He's trying to kill me.

08:21.817 --> 08:25.218
Hey! Hey! Hey!

08:25.220 --> 08:28.290
Help me!
They're trying to kill me.

08:29.824 --> 08:30.825
Help!

08:32.594 --> 08:36.061
Help! Please.

08:36.063 --> 08:40.097
Help me.
They're trying to kill me.

08:40.100 --> 08:43.969
It's them. The desert.
They're alive.

08:43.971 --> 08:46.039
They can hear someone else.
Everything they say.

08:46.041 --> 08:47.406
They're out there,
they're listening.

08:47.408 --> 08:49.007
They're gonna get us
right now.

08:49.009 --> 08:50.310
I swear to Mike...

08:50.312 --> 08:52.011
Darling, there's nobody here
but us.

08:52.013 --> 08:53.579
No, no.
No, no.

08:53.581 --> 08:54.980
That's what
they want you to think.

08:54.982 --> 08:57.182
They're here.

08:57.184 --> 08:59.419
Everything that you say,

08:59.421 --> 09:02.354
they turn around and they'll
use it against you.

09:02.356 --> 09:04.556
They hear everything
you're saying.

09:04.558 --> 09:07.160
Your deepest, darkest fears.

09:07.162 --> 09:08.994
They'll pick up a reality.

09:08.996 --> 09:10.863
They're here.
We're surrounded.

09:10.865 --> 09:13.366
- Deepest, darkest fears?
- Deepest, darkest fears.

09:13.368 --> 09:15.200
You mean, like...
like mummies?

09:15.202 --> 09:18.137
Yes, yes, like mummies.

09:18.139 --> 09:20.039
Like fucking mummies.

09:20.041 --> 09:22.941
They're up here,
they're on us now.

09:22.943 --> 09:24.377
Mummies? Really, Kim?

09:24.379 --> 09:26.212
- Nobody's afraid of mummies.
- Like mummies.

09:26.214 --> 09:29.218
I am.

09:52.606 --> 09:53.608
Topless.

10:05.186 --> 10:07.089
Me, too.

10:12.559 --> 10:13.628
Come, motherfucker.

10:16.530 --> 10:18.399
Stop.

10:28.176 --> 10:30.980
I hate fucking mummies.

10:50.164 --> 10:52.500
I said
I hate fucking mummies.

11:12.687 --> 11:15.988
So, how much longer?

11:15.990 --> 11:17.489
A few hours.

11:17.491 --> 11:20.258
Yeah, we had a bit
of a late start.

11:20.260 --> 11:22.195
I'm not pointing any fingers.

11:22.197 --> 11:23.628
I just wanted to know
if there's anything

11:23.630 --> 11:25.498
we could do
to make up some time.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.667
Yeah, there is,
we're already doing it.

11:28.669 --> 11:31.403
- We left the highway?
- Yeah.

11:31.405 --> 11:33.305
About five minutes ago.

11:33.307 --> 11:34.507
This ride may get
a bit bumpy,

11:34.509 --> 11:36.008
but the route should shave

11:36.010 --> 11:37.509
about five hours off.

11:37.511 --> 11:38.579
Easy.

11:51.625 --> 11:55.965
Hey! Hey! Hey!

11:58.533 --> 12:00.269
Hey!

12:05.572 --> 12:06.738
Oh, shit.

12:14.182 --> 12:17.720
Warned you.
The ride may get a bit bumpy.

12:31.265 --> 12:33.468
You're so fucked.

12:37.538 --> 12:39.274
See, I told you.

12:48.549 --> 12:50.682
What the hell
is the driver on? Acid?

12:50.684 --> 12:52.852
A shortcut. Relax, Alan,
we're making good time.

12:52.854 --> 12:55.287
We better be. This ride
ain't cheap, you know.

12:55.289 --> 12:57.757
I gave up a hunting trip
in Africa for this.

12:57.759 --> 13:01.794
Well, there's better music and plenty
of eye candy of the female variety.

13:01.796 --> 13:03.429
It's pretty amazing.

13:03.431 --> 13:05.430
It doesn't matter
if you're rich or poor,

13:05.432 --> 13:07.599
just as long as you bring enough
condoms and toilet paper.

13:07.601 --> 13:10.368
And I did not forget
the Viagra either.

13:10.370 --> 13:14.706
- Ooh, Viagra's a good gift.
- Not a gift. It's for me.

13:14.708 --> 13:17.512
My gift is my dick.

13:26.221 --> 13:27.752
Are we there?

13:27.754 --> 13:31.493
Come on. Aw.

13:32.726 --> 13:35.560
Hey. Everybody out.

13:35.562 --> 13:37.396
We're just making
a quick pit stop.

13:37.398 --> 13:39.799
Gonna check the wheel
tire pressure.

13:39.801 --> 13:42.502
So, sit tight.

13:42.504 --> 13:44.402
We'll be back on the road
before you know it.

13:44.404 --> 13:46.839
No problem, as long as
we get there tonight.

13:46.841 --> 13:49.574
Don't worry, sweetie,
it's going to be the night

13:49.576 --> 13:50.578
of your life.

Hey, who's up for 100 bottles
of beer on the wall?

13:56.884 --> 13:58.283
- I am.
- Me! I'll have a beer.

- With what?
- You'll see.

14:35.190 --> 14:37.489
Great, and I have to pee.

14:37.491 --> 14:39.324

15:06.587 --> 15:08.286

15:08.288 --> 15:10.256
She told us not
to leave the bus.

15:10.258 --> 15:12.925
Drivers do not tell the
paying customer what to do.

15:35.783 --> 15:38.751
Oh, I love communing
with nature.

15:38.753 --> 15:40.518
Looks like it's
going to be a nice night.

15:40.520 --> 15:45.391
- Once we ever get there.
- Well, you know what they say.

15:45.393 --> 15:49.362
It's not about the destination but
enjoying the journey that matters.

15:49.364 --> 15:51.631

15:51.633 --> 15:55.901
Oh, they? They are those who

Pleasure to meet you.

16:01.775 --> 16:04.509

rich-as-fuck entrepreneur

16:04.511 --> 16:06.311
and wild game hunter
on the side, but,

16:14.489 --> 16:16.888
- That wasn't very nice.
- I didn't come here to be nice.

16:16.890 --> 16:19.925
I came here to fuck, do drugs,

16:19.927 --> 16:22.962
get fucked up,
and then fuck some more.

16:22.964 --> 16:25.297
In that order. You?

16:25.299 --> 16:27.833
I don't know,
maybe meet a girl?

16:27.835 --> 16:30.703
Settle down, have some kids.

16:30.705 --> 16:34.339
I'm kidding.
Everything you said times two.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.842
That's my boy.
Make an asshole out of you yet.

16:36.844 --> 16:39.377
Does anyone else get any
cell phone service out here?

16:39.379 --> 16:42.647
No, we must be in a dead zone.
Get used to it.

16:42.649 --> 16:45.017
Hey, yo, man.
Anybody seen our bus driver?

16:45.019 --> 16:46.951
She's not back here
or anywhere.

16:46.953 --> 16:50.488
Typical. We should have
taken my dad's chopper.

16:50.490 --> 16:52.624
Have to skydive in.
People have.

16:52.626 --> 16:55.796
Peter, you did not tell me
that was an option.

16:57.331 --> 17:00.565
Yo, don't MOOP.

17:00.567 --> 17:04.469
- Excuse me?
- MOOP. Mess Out of Place.

17:04.471 --> 17:06.971
At Burning Man we leave
nothing behind, it's a rule.

17:06.973 --> 17:09.709
Rules are made to be broken.

17:09.711 --> 17:11.779
Oh, my God!

17:13.548 --> 17:15.683
What the hell are you
yelling about now?

17:18.653 --> 17:21.353
- Peter. Peter?
- Yeah?

17:21.355 --> 17:22.990
Look over there.

17:29.596 --> 17:30.962
It looks like
we hit something.

17:30.964 --> 17:33.701
No, we didn't.
We weren't driving.

17:43.144 --> 17:46.815
What are you doing?

17:51.853 --> 17:54.152
Warren, I really have to pee.

17:54.154 --> 17:58.056
Ugh, you don't need my help, okay,
so just pick a spot and squat.

17:58.058 --> 17:59.658
I think you need a key
to get in there.

17:59.660 --> 18:01.160
If we had a gun,
we could shoot it out.

18:01.162 --> 18:03.962
Yeah, only problem is my gun
is inside my luggage,

18:03.964 --> 18:05.096
which is inside
this compartment!

18:05.098 --> 18:06.532
Whoa, a gun?

18:06.534 --> 18:08.033
You brought a gun
to Burning Man?

18:08.035 --> 18:09.668
I don't think they allow
guns at the festival.

18:09.670 --> 18:12.638
Well, better safe
than stupid.

18:12.640 --> 18:16.976
Ugh, I'm so darn pissed. Ugh, if
Warren pisses me off one more time.

18:16.978 --> 18:18.980
Ugh, God.

18:25.653 --> 18:27.620
Hey, guys,
this one's unlocked.

18:27.622 --> 18:29.391
It's stuck.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.558
Oh, what the fuck?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.026
Yo, that is not
our bus driver.

18:35.028 --> 18:37.563
Actually, I think it is.

18:37.565 --> 18:39.998
Then who the hell's been
driving us this whole time?

18:40.000 --> 18:43.437
- Good fucking question.
- Ugh.

18:46.673 --> 18:49.141
Sure, just pee
whenever you want.

18:49.143 --> 18:51.709
Oh, God, I don't want
to be here.

18:51.711 --> 18:54.081
Sure,
this is so embarrassing.

18:56.817 --> 18:58.619
Okay, I can do this.

19:04.157 --> 19:06.927
Everyone!

19:10.865 --> 19:12.800
Back to the bus, now!

19:21.541 --> 19:22.843
Go!

20:04.285 --> 20:07.022
Oh, hell nah.
You don't know who you fu...

20:49.130 --> 20:52.067
Run little piggies. Run!

21:26.866 --> 21:28.802
Help me!

21:32.839 --> 21:34.206
Do you know how
to drive this thing?

21:34.208 --> 21:36.208
- Not without the keys.
- She must have

21:36.210 --> 21:37.211
taken them with her.

21:52.326 --> 21:55.126
- I wanna go home!
- Get us out of here!

21:55.128 --> 21:57.131
Know how
to hot-wire a bus, doll?

22:00.267 --> 22:02.770
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

22:04.805 --> 22:07.373
Chill out, man, we're out.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.908
Yeah, bathroom's all yours,
quit rocking the boat.

22:09.910 --> 22:13.014
This is a bus,
and we're not doing it.

22:25.259 --> 22:29.161
This can't be happening. I didn't
even want to come on this trip.

22:29.163 --> 22:31.029
It was a pinky dare
by my friends.

22:31.031 --> 22:32.363
They said
I wasn't outgoing enough.

22:32.365 --> 22:35.234
"Oh, Stuart,
you need to live life.

22:35.236 --> 22:38.340
You need to get out more,
be more social." Bullshit!

22:48.048 --> 22:50.449
State-of-the-art transport,
motherfuckers!

22:50.451 --> 22:52.684
Bulletproof glass,
reinforced steel frame,

22:52.686 --> 22:54.253
we're practically
in a fucking tank.

23:06.701 --> 23:08.734
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

23:08.736 --> 23:11.303
Desert dwelling nomads.
They came out of nowhere.

23:11.305 --> 23:12.938
It's like they were
waiting for us.

23:12.940 --> 23:15.210
Best guess, they were.

23:19.946 --> 23:24.882
Seriously? You didn't hear anything
that was going on outside?

23:24.884 --> 23:27.452
We were... preoccupied.

23:29.289 --> 23:32.091
- My phone isn't working.
- Nobody's is.

23:32.093 --> 23:34.159
Okay, bad news.

23:34.161 --> 23:36.698
Our driver took off with the
keys, so we're stuck here.

23:38.365 --> 23:41.299
Good news, I don't think
they can get in.

23:41.301 --> 23:43.802
I researched this company
before I booked this trip.

23:43.804 --> 23:47.242
This is a very sturdy bus, the windows
are shatterproof, steel frame.

23:48.776 --> 23:49.941
This vehicle was meant
to withstand

23:49.943 --> 23:51.276
the worst
impact scenarios.

23:51.278 --> 23:53.312
Does that include
desert dweller rejects

23:53.314 --> 23:55.847
who've watched the Mad Max
series one too many times?

23:55.849 --> 23:58.750
- Yeah, who the hell are they?
- They?

23:58.752 --> 24:00.986
Well, they are the ones who are
out there and trying to kill us.

24:00.988 --> 24:02.787
Well, where is the bus driver?

24:02.789 --> 24:04.523
I mean, if she's out there
dead somewhere,

24:04.525 --> 24:06.525
maybe she still
has the keys on her?

24:06.527 --> 24:08.026
And one of us could go...

24:08.028 --> 24:09.495
Oh, the bus driver
is out there all right.

24:09.497 --> 24:11.130
But I don't think
she's dead.

24:11.132 --> 24:13.265
That's a good thing, no?

24:13.267 --> 24:15.066
No.

24:15.068 --> 24:17.102
Because I don't think
she's on our side, either.

24:17.104 --> 24:19.304
We found the real bus driver

24:19.306 --> 24:20.873
in the luggage compartment
in the back.

24:20.875 --> 24:23.776
- She's dead.
- Dead?

24:23.778 --> 24:25.477
Yeah, it's a side effect
of being murdered.

24:25.479 --> 24:28.913
That's... that's just great.
Just fan-fucking-tastic.

24:28.915 --> 24:30.217
What are we going to do now?

24:31.249 --> 24:33.184
Say "game over"
and I will fucking hit you.

24:33.186 --> 24:36.555
- This entire trip was a setup.
- But why? For what reason?

24:36.557 --> 24:39.224
Just to get us out here in the
middle of nowhere and kill us all?

24:56.911 --> 25:01.814
Behold, the god of destruction
and praise his glory.

25:01.816 --> 25:04.315
Praise his glory!

25:04.317 --> 25:08.120
Behold, my lord and savior!

25:08.122 --> 25:12.224
Behold, my lord and savior!

25:12.226 --> 25:15.459
Behold, my lord and savior!

25:15.461 --> 25:19.498
If this is Burning Man,
it has changed drastically.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.102
That's not
an effigy of a man.

25:24.238 --> 25:27.408
I call upon the high priestess
of the night to commence.

25:44.224 --> 25:46.860
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck is right.

25:49.128 --> 25:52.064
Get off me!
What are you doing? No!

25:52.066 --> 25:53.401
Help me!

25:56.369 --> 25:58.170
What are you, fucking crazy?

25:58.172 --> 26:00.040
No, ahh!

26:01.608 --> 26:04.545
That's what's her name,
Ginger something.

26:05.546 --> 26:07.182
Get it off me!

26:15.955 --> 26:18.523
What are they doing to her?

26:18.525 --> 26:19.958
Nothing good.

26:19.960 --> 26:23.298
Help me!
What are you doing? No!

26:24.298 --> 26:25.532
Help!

26:28.535 --> 26:31.139
The blood really brings out
her nipples.

26:34.974 --> 26:36.475
No.

26:36.477 --> 26:38.012
No!

26:42.650 --> 26:45.019
Help me!

26:47.621 --> 26:49.654
Oh, great one,

26:49.656 --> 26:52.556
give us the pleasure
of your presence.

26:52.558 --> 26:54.995
As we call upon you tonight.

27:00.134 --> 27:01.466
Look!

27:09.576 --> 27:11.278
We've got to do something!

27:13.446 --> 27:16.448
With no weapons and no idea how
many of them are out there,

27:16.450 --> 27:18.952
our rescue options
are extremely limited.

27:28.127 --> 27:30.261
Accept our blood snake.

27:30.263 --> 27:33.431
Purified and then holy bows
of the sinners.

27:44.577 --> 27:46.711
It is glorious.

27:46.713 --> 27:48.348
And it's also fucking hot.

28:02.061 --> 28:04.997
This is some fucked-up shit.

28:04.999 --> 28:06.698
They're gonna kill us all.

28:06.700 --> 28:09.633
No, they're not. We just
have to think of a plan.

28:09.635 --> 28:13.071
- That's a good idea.
- No, that's a statement.

28:13.073 --> 28:16.377
What we need is a good idea.

28:20.114 --> 28:22.314
Looks like she's ready to pop.

28:22.316 --> 28:24.482
I think she needs a C-section.

28:24.484 --> 28:27.054
Do the honors, my dear.

28:33.394 --> 28:35.494
They're on the bus!

28:35.496 --> 28:36.631
Thank you, Ms. Obvious.

29:05.058 --> 29:07.392
They're gonna get in!

29:07.394 --> 29:08.826
No, they're not.
Not without a blowtorch.

29:08.828 --> 29:10.999
Well, maybe they have
a blowtorch, smart guy.

29:24.678 --> 29:28.145
- Can you hear me now?
- We need to get to my luggage.

29:28.147 --> 29:31.449
- Help me find the panel.
- What are you doing?

29:31.451 --> 29:34.085
These buses have trap doors
like in airplanes.

29:34.087 --> 29:37.154
We should be able to get to our
bags through the floorboards.

29:37.156 --> 29:39.157
- Aha!
- Does it need a key?

29:39.159 --> 29:41.129
Nah, we can jimmy it.

30:09.123 --> 30:10.889
Leave us alone!

30:10.891 --> 30:14.325
Yeah, I'm sure
that's gonna work.

30:14.327 --> 30:15.494
Fuck you, Warren.

30:15.496 --> 30:17.799
- I mean, fuck you!
- Yeah?

30:20.767 --> 30:22.370
Whoo!

30:24.872 --> 30:25.903
You just wanted to join

30:25.905 --> 30:27.471
the orgy in the sex dome.

30:27.473 --> 30:29.407
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?
- Hey.

30:29.409 --> 30:31.575
Will somebody bring me a bottle
opener from the minibar?

30:31.577 --> 30:35.383
I'll check the bathroom, if there's
something useful in there.

30:51.632 --> 30:52.799
Found it.

30:56.803 --> 30:59.540
This isn't real. I'm just
having a bad trip, right?

31:00.707 --> 31:01.709
We all are.

31:05.179 --> 31:07.478
Oh, yeah!

31:07.480 --> 31:11.219
It is an honor.
I am on fire!

31:12.286 --> 31:14.786
Burning, burning.

31:14.788 --> 31:16.888
Burn, burn, burn.

31:16.890 --> 31:19.924
All hail the master!

31:19.926 --> 31:21.895
We entered hell.

31:35.875 --> 31:38.913
I got it!

31:46.819 --> 31:48.889
Hold him.
Oh, my God.

31:50.223 --> 31:51.759
I don't know how.

32:03.502 --> 32:05.437
What happened?
What happened?

32:05.439 --> 32:07.905
- They got Stuart.
- He's dead!

32:07.907 --> 32:08.909
Heads up.

32:10.876 --> 32:13.277
Ah.

32:13.279 --> 32:16.680
You like that?
I bet you do.

32:16.682 --> 32:17.915
Wonderful.

32:17.917 --> 32:19.517
He's in a better place.

32:19.519 --> 32:22.286
The hills have eyes.

32:22.288 --> 32:25.023
And ears, nose,
and throats.

32:25.025 --> 32:28.259
No, no, no.

32:28.261 --> 32:31.531
No time to mourn.
Let's get this luggage.

32:33.866 --> 32:36.634
Go through them.
See if there's anything useful.

32:36.636 --> 32:38.536
But these aren't our bags.

32:38.538 --> 32:41.375
I don't think their dead
owners are going to mind.

32:44.443 --> 32:46.580
Yeah! Whoo!

32:48.848 --> 32:51.985
This is gonna be useful.
Anybody need to take a shit?

32:58.991 --> 33:01.293
Hey, that's mine.

33:01.295 --> 33:03.327
It's heavy.
What you got in here?

33:03.329 --> 33:06.030
Just Burning Man gifts.
Nothing that can help us.

33:06.032 --> 33:07.234
Just leave it.

33:09.568 --> 33:11.605
Hey, I said leave it alone.

33:24.084 --> 33:27.818
I came prepared for a week
at the festival, all right?

33:27.820 --> 33:31.055
Not some blood and sex
freak horror show.

33:31.057 --> 33:32.856
Do you have any whips
and chains in there?

33:32.858 --> 33:35.626
We actually might
be able to use those.

33:35.628 --> 33:38.095
Sorry. I'm not into S&M.

33:38.097 --> 33:40.667
See? I'm not the only one.

33:43.403 --> 33:46.673
We're not exactly prepared
for war, are we?

33:47.673 --> 33:50.411
Uh... eh.

33:57.483 --> 33:58.519
Hello, my little friend.

34:10.697 --> 34:11.762
Who's shooting?

34:11.764 --> 34:13.398
Hello there,
miss bus driver.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.132
We were wondering where
you disappeared to.

34:15.135 --> 34:17.438
Al? Alan?

34:20.005 --> 34:21.775
You.

34:26.079 --> 34:27.648
Look who I found
lurking about.

34:28.882 --> 34:30.748
I'm ready to get out of here.

34:30.751 --> 34:35.487
- Yeah, abso-fucking-lutely.
- It's not gonna happen.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.621
Oh, yes, it is. As soon as you
put the key in the ignition.

34:37.623 --> 34:39.456
Bring me the one.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.829
Let us in! Let us in!

34:44.831 --> 34:47.632
Let us in!
Let us in!

34:47.634 --> 34:50.702
You need to go call off your group
of cult crazies while you're at it.

34:50.704 --> 34:52.402
Oh, they're not my group.

34:52.405 --> 34:53.972
Bullshit.

34:53.974 --> 34:55.840
Are you trying to tell us
you're not one of them?

34:55.842 --> 34:59.510
Well, of course, I'm one of
them, but I'm not the leader.

34:59.512 --> 35:01.979
I'm just a servant to the chosen one.
We all are.

35:01.981 --> 35:04.849
Let us in. Let us in.

35:04.851 --> 35:07.751
The chosen one? Who?

35:07.753 --> 35:09.119
That bald-headed baboon
out there

35:09.121 --> 35:11.688
and his Selma Hayek
wannabe sidekick?

35:27.641 --> 35:30.675
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
but that was so funny.

35:30.677 --> 35:32.747
Get the unholy sand.

35:35.949 --> 35:38.650
- Why did you bring us out here?
- Isn't it obvious?

35:38.652 --> 35:40.552
They needed sacrifices.

35:40.554 --> 35:43.655
You don't know anything
about us, sweetie.

35:43.657 --> 35:45.456
And we're not sticking
around to find out.

35:45.458 --> 35:48.626
Where are the bus keys?

35:48.628 --> 35:49.726
I don't have them.

35:49.728 --> 35:51.563
I saw you holding them.

35:51.565 --> 35:55.867
Oh, those were the outside
luggage compartment keys.

35:55.869 --> 35:58.068
Not the keys to the ignition.

35:58.070 --> 35:59.771
I suppose
we should just believe you,

35:59.773 --> 36:01.673
because you've been
so honest with us so far.

36:01.675 --> 36:02.673
Yeah.

36:05.478 --> 36:07.010
If you won't give them,

36:07.012 --> 36:08.912
we'll be forced to take
them from you.

36:08.914 --> 36:10.682
Be my guest.

36:10.684 --> 36:12.851
Oh, with pleasure.

36:14.119 --> 36:15.588
Oh.

36:17.623 --> 36:21.626
- Strip her.
- Now you're talking.

36:21.628 --> 36:24.532
Too bad we don't have a giant
snake to shove down your throat.

36:49.021 --> 36:51.588
Wow.

36:51.590 --> 36:53.858
You're just all types of
crazy, aren't you, lady?

36:53.860 --> 36:56.197
My desert pets.

36:57.797 --> 36:59.764
My faithful protectors.

36:59.766 --> 37:02.300
You see, we come
from a religion,

37:02.302 --> 37:04.936
an ancient religion
before time began.

37:04.938 --> 37:08.206
Tonight marks the time
of the beginning.

37:08.208 --> 37:09.574
Spread it evenly.

37:09.576 --> 37:12.010
And now is the time.

37:12.012 --> 37:15.146
For the chosen one to spread
his darkness across the land.

37:15.148 --> 37:18.749
Blah, blah, blah.
Heard it all before.

37:18.751 --> 37:21.753
You sound like a bad,
Z-grade movie, so shut up!

37:28.862 --> 37:31.130
God, I'm so fucking wet
right now!

37:32.965 --> 37:36.066
We clear a path for the rise
of the great one.

37:36.068 --> 37:42.139
To deliver us from all that is and
all that will be brought forth.

37:42.141 --> 37:45.275
Alan, I'm not finding
the keys on her.

37:45.277 --> 37:47.311
How about in her?

37:47.313 --> 37:51.249
I like the way
you think, sister.

37:51.751 --> 37:55.686
Come to us.
Our bodies are yours.

37:55.688 --> 37:56.920
For the taking.

37:56.922 --> 37:59.592
What... what are they
doing out there?

38:01.661 --> 38:05.829
Drink from me.
What's mine is yours.

38:05.831 --> 38:08.599
My body I give freely.

38:08.601 --> 38:11.105
Not exactly homegrown,
but whatever.

38:13.039 --> 38:15.072
They're preparing for the
rising of the chosen one.

38:15.074 --> 38:17.108
What does that have
to do with us?

38:17.110 --> 38:19.046
Because...

38:22.916 --> 38:24.849
it's my favorite part.

38:24.851 --> 38:28.122
One of you is it.

38:31.791 --> 38:35.693
Repeat after me.
Release the chosen one.

38:35.695 --> 38:40.231
Release the chosen one.

38:40.233 --> 38:43.066
- Chosen by who?
- The master.

38:43.068 --> 38:46.204
- Could you be any vaguer?
- Guys?

38:46.206 --> 38:48.706
Guys, I don't like what
they're doing out there.

38:48.708 --> 38:50.907
We need to hurry
and get this bus moving now.

38:50.909 --> 38:53.744
The keys.

38:53.746 --> 38:57.081
- I can't help you.
- Can't or won't?

38:57.083 --> 38:59.016
No comment.

38:59.018 --> 39:02.019
Maybe she dropped
them under the luggage.

39:02.021 --> 39:04.088
Slipped them under a bag
or something on her way up?

39:04.090 --> 39:05.956
I'll go look.

39:05.958 --> 39:07.894
Yeah, me, too.

39:09.963 --> 39:11.198
Bye.

39:15.034 --> 39:17.969
Looks like
some sort of powder.

39:17.971 --> 39:21.238
Flammable? Are they going
to light the bus on fire?

39:21.240 --> 39:24.141
That's not a bad idea. Wish
I would have thought of it.

39:24.143 --> 39:26.110
I thought you said
you're not the one in charge?

39:26.112 --> 39:28.345
- I'm not.
- Then who is?

39:28.347 --> 39:30.748
Why, the chosen one,
of course.

39:30.750 --> 39:34.221
Only... that person
doesn't know it yet.

39:37.023 --> 39:39.891
Shit, we're never going
to find it in here.

39:39.893 --> 39:42.894
We will, all right?
Just keep looking.

39:42.896 --> 39:44.898
Maybe she slipped it
in a bag.

39:49.902 --> 39:54.204
Oh.
Looks like somebody

39:54.206 --> 39:56.474
was planning on keeping
the party up all night.

39:56.476 --> 39:58.342
Those are mine,
put them down.

39:58.344 --> 40:01.945
You try getting drilled for hours
on end and see how you like it.

40:01.947 --> 40:03.914
I thought you were
only into girls.

40:03.916 --> 40:06.753
And this is one
of the reasons why.

40:11.490 --> 40:13.059
Now we're talking.

40:33.880 --> 40:37.215
Oh, fuck, if they get through
those panels, we're all dead.

40:37.217 --> 40:38.885
Not without a fight.

40:40.186 --> 40:42.021
Sorry.

40:44.389 --> 40:47.994
- Any luck?
- No, it's not down here.

40:50.829 --> 40:54.365
Release the
chosen one or perish.

40:54.367 --> 40:57.501
Release the chosen one
or perish.

40:57.503 --> 40:59.906
If you release the chosen one, we
might let the rest of you live.

41:01.306 --> 41:04.441
What chosen one?
Who is the chosen one?

41:04.443 --> 41:06.880
Okay, process
of elimination here.

41:08.380 --> 41:11.516
Who's Jewish here? Jewish?

41:11.518 --> 41:12.950
- Jewish?
- No.

41:12.952 --> 41:15.052
- Jewish?
- Huh?

41:15.054 --> 41:19.456
She said wants the chosen
one, not chosen people.

41:19.458 --> 41:20.858
There's a difference?

41:20.860 --> 41:25.162
Release the chosen one
or perish.

41:25.164 --> 41:26.563
Look, we're through
fucking around with you,

41:26.565 --> 41:30.169
you tattoo lady
monster freak!

41:31.471 --> 41:35.005
Shh. They can hear you.

41:35.007 --> 41:36.941
All we want...

41:36.943 --> 41:40.278
is the chosen one.

41:40.280 --> 41:43.146
The virgin.

41:43.148 --> 41:44.317
Virgin?

41:45.318 --> 41:46.883
Do you honestly think

41:46.885 --> 41:48.485
one of us is still a virgin?

41:48.487 --> 41:51.488
Honey, that ship
sailed ten years ago.

41:51.490 --> 41:53.057
Twelve for me.

41:53.059 --> 41:55.425
Three here.
I was late bloomer.

41:55.427 --> 41:57.829
I fucked my way
out of the womb.

41:57.831 --> 42:01.199
Just means none of you
are the chosen one!

42:01.201 --> 42:04.003
Then who does that leave?

42:12.077 --> 42:15.479
Release the
chosen one or perish!

42:15.481 --> 42:20.617
I can personally attest
that she is no virgin.

42:20.619 --> 42:22.186
Pure and innocent, no.

42:22.188 --> 42:24.856
But we go back
to the biblical term.

42:28.327 --> 42:32.028
And no matter what you two did
in that bathroom back there,

42:32.030 --> 42:34.902
you simply don't have the
right equipment for the job.

42:39.905 --> 42:43.474
And no, buzz pop cocktails
doesn't exactly qualify.

42:43.476 --> 42:46.978
- Tastes great, though.
- Less filling.

42:46.980 --> 42:49.079
How did you know?

42:49.081 --> 42:51.615
How could you have
possibly known?

42:51.617 --> 42:55.019
We've been watching you ever
since you were born, Lara.

42:55.021 --> 42:58.289
You don't even know
who your true parents are.

42:58.291 --> 43:01.892
- You were adopted.
- Why...

43:01.894 --> 43:05.965
I bet you think you got on this
bus today by happenstance.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.166
I...

43:13.572 --> 43:15.509
I woke up this morning...

43:18.244 --> 43:22.112
and took something, I think,
I don't know.

43:22.114 --> 43:24.548
Then this creep
gave me a ride

43:24.550 --> 43:28.019
and when I wouldn't put out, he
dropped me off at this bus stop.

43:28.021 --> 43:31.155
That creep's name
is Gregory.

43:31.157 --> 43:32.657
Release!

43:32.659 --> 43:36.329
Release! Let yourself go.

43:41.166 --> 43:43.237
What?

43:45.570 --> 43:48.039
Time to come
out tonight, Lara.

43:48.041 --> 43:51.508
It's all been planned.
Tonight's the big night.

43:51.510 --> 43:55.112
You come with me and maybe some
of these sheep will survive!

43:55.114 --> 43:57.113
Fuck you, lady.

43:57.115 --> 43:58.518
She's not going anywhere.

43:59.518 --> 44:01.017
Damn straight, bitch.

44:40.025 --> 44:41.994
Hail, hail!

44:43.496 --> 44:45.365
Someone pull out their cell!

44:56.641 --> 44:57.710
Where's the bus driver?

45:04.217 --> 45:06.550
All hail the chosen one!

45:06.552 --> 45:09.423
All hail
the chosen one!

45:12.025 --> 45:14.260
All hail the chosen one!

45:22.534 --> 45:25.304
All hail the chosen one!

45:35.114 --> 45:37.748
Release, release, release.

45:37.750 --> 45:40.586
Release, release, release.

45:49.528 --> 45:51.097
What the fucking hell?

45:55.300 --> 45:56.666
Where did all
of her tattoos go?

46:12.684 --> 46:14.253
Release!

46:15.253 --> 46:16.288
Release!

46:17.289 --> 46:19.759
Release! Release!

46:51.456 --> 46:53.592
All hail the...

47:28.161 --> 47:29.592
How is this bus running?

47:29.594 --> 47:31.464
I don't know, but let's get
the fuck out of here.

47:41.340 --> 47:42.843
Whoa!

47:50.650 --> 47:51.651
Shit.

47:59.759 --> 48:01.260
Jesus.

48:15.907 --> 48:18.911
Was anyone bitten
or scratched or stung?

48:20.478 --> 48:23.449
- I guess just me.
- Jesus.

48:25.585 --> 48:27.653
She really took a bite
out of you.

48:30.755 --> 48:32.956
Chicks know a tasty treat
when they see one.

48:32.958 --> 48:35.291
Don't talk.
It makes it worse.

48:35.293 --> 48:37.961
Guess we can add cannibalism
to their long line of evil.

48:37.963 --> 48:39.896
Whoo-hoo!

48:39.898 --> 48:42.900
Why didn't you drive us
out of here?

48:42.902 --> 48:45.668
The bus stalled. Without a key,
there's not much I can do.

48:45.670 --> 48:47.540
This is all my fault.

48:54.280 --> 48:57.250
If it wasn't for me, none
of you would be in danger.

49:00.418 --> 49:04.621
I should have never
gotten on this bus.

49:04.623 --> 49:05.858
And I wouldn't have if...

49:08.527 --> 49:11.394
she didn't say it was free.

49:11.396 --> 49:17.267
Stop that, right now. Okay, you cannot
blame yourself for the acts of some...

49:17.269 --> 49:20.871
psychotic cult of sand
demon devil worshippers.

49:20.873 --> 49:23.874
Release the chosen one!
It is our time.

49:23.876 --> 49:26.376
Release the chosen one!

49:26.378 --> 49:28.778
Release, release!

49:28.780 --> 49:32.483
Release, release, release!

49:32.485 --> 49:34.385
This is a nightmare.

49:34.387 --> 49:36.586
Sounds more like
a broken record.

49:36.588 --> 49:38.856
Well, I for one choose
not to perish.

49:38.858 --> 49:41.592
- Time to go, Lara.
- No one is going anywhere.

49:41.594 --> 49:43.427
If we stay on this bus,
they're eventually going

49:43.429 --> 49:44.827
to break in here
and kill us all!

49:44.829 --> 49:45.898
I don't want to die.

49:46.965 --> 49:48.065
Yeah, well, that's what

49:48.067 --> 49:49.800
virgin sacrifices tend to do.

49:49.802 --> 49:52.001
I'm sorry.
I didn't make the rules here.

49:52.003 --> 49:55.541
So what would happen
if our virgin sacrifice...

49:57.309 --> 49:58.876
was no longer a virgin?

49:58.878 --> 50:03.313
I need everyone
to release. Now.

50:03.315 --> 50:07.050
Release. Release.

50:07.052 --> 50:09.485
Well, no virgin,
no sacrifice.

50:09.487 --> 50:13.657
You mean,
if I lose my cherry...

50:13.659 --> 50:15.793
there's no reason
for them to kill me?

50:15.795 --> 50:17.030
Exactly.

50:21.800 --> 50:23.700
Well, I'm less
opposed to that idea.

50:23.702 --> 50:28.405
And I can help. See, I have all
these special toys in my bag.

50:28.407 --> 50:31.845
Ivy, I really don't want to
lose my virginity to a dildo.

50:33.079 --> 50:34.545
Well, that counts Warren out.

50:34.547 --> 50:36.979
Ha-ha, funny honey.
Really funny.

50:36.981 --> 50:38.749
I'll do it.

50:38.751 --> 50:40.550
Alan, with the amount of blood
you've already lost,

50:40.552 --> 50:42.086
I don't think you're up
for doing anything tonight.

50:42.088 --> 50:43.954
That's what
the Viagra's for.

50:43.956 --> 50:45.688
No, increased blood flow

50:45.690 --> 50:48.891
anywhere is the last thing
you need right now.

50:48.893 --> 50:51.897
Well, then that only leaves...

50:56.469 --> 50:58.434
Remove your robes!

50:58.436 --> 51:01.871
Come on, girl.
Let's play.

51:01.873 --> 51:04.443
Meow.

51:16.655 --> 51:18.425
What was your name again?

51:20.960 --> 51:22.929
Peter.

51:25.797 --> 51:30.032
Look, despite popular belief, not
all guys can just perform on cue.

51:30.034 --> 51:33.472
Are you kidding me?
Look at her.

51:36.007 --> 51:37.109
Meow.

51:42.581 --> 51:45.548
Lara, you're beautiful
and everything

51:45.550 --> 51:49.452
and I would love to,
I mean, I'd be honored.

51:49.454 --> 51:52.722
What's the matter? Got a
little problem downstairs?

51:52.724 --> 51:56.492
I'm just saying, you know.

51:56.494 --> 51:58.929
Here, in front of everyone?

51:58.931 --> 52:01.465
I'm not a porn actor,
I'm an investment banker.

52:01.467 --> 52:03.869
I need more fingers.

52:05.804 --> 52:07.838
Okay, if you won't fuck her,
I will.

52:07.840 --> 52:10.007
- Oh, the fuck you will.
- Isn't that what I just said?

52:10.009 --> 52:12.443
- Give me a break, okay?
- Oh, I'll give you a break.

52:12.445 --> 52:15.012
- Peter, please.
- I'll break it off.

52:15.014 --> 52:16.847
I really don't want
to die a virgin.

52:16.849 --> 52:18.818
I gave you so
many orgasms last week.

52:20.152 --> 52:21.588
We can dim the lights.

52:22.855 --> 52:24.590
Or how about...

52:30.728 --> 52:32.398
That could work.

52:38.838 --> 52:41.408
Release, release.

52:48.246 --> 52:49.715
Uh...

52:51.750 --> 52:52.751
hi.

52:53.786 --> 52:54.954
Hi.

52:56.755 --> 52:58.621
There's not a lot
of room in here.

52:58.623 --> 53:02.592
Yeah, I'm probably
a little tight.

53:02.594 --> 53:05.128
Oh, no, that's not what I...
never mind.

53:05.130 --> 53:07.063
Give me the gun,
I need to reload.

53:07.065 --> 53:08.100
I can do it.

53:19.177 --> 53:22.646
How old are you?

53:22.648 --> 53:28.017
- Just turned 18.
- Eighteen? That's a good age.

53:28.019 --> 53:31.988
Well, to be honest,
I turn 18 tomorrow.

53:34.092 --> 53:35.858
You're only a minor?

53:35.860 --> 53:37.029
I don't know,
what time is it?

53:39.797 --> 53:43.535
- Five minutes to midnight.
- So... I'm almost legal.

53:45.570 --> 53:47.072
I won't tell anyone.

53:52.311 --> 53:54.577
Would you just hurry up
and screw already?

53:54.579 --> 53:56.612
Fuck off!

54:01.987 --> 54:03.255
Release!

54:05.291 --> 54:06.690
Release the chosen one!

54:06.692 --> 54:08.728
Release the chosen one.

54:10.228 --> 54:11.862
We're working on it.

54:11.864 --> 54:13.833
Yeah, just not
the way you think.

54:15.733 --> 54:17.601
Feel the passion.

54:17.603 --> 54:20.807
Feel the fury!

54:22.675 --> 54:25.577
You guys? I wasn't
kidding about the key.

54:27.947 --> 54:29.912
Cavity search?

54:29.914 --> 54:32.719
You really think
that crazy bitch swallowed it?

54:43.596 --> 54:45.262
Let's have a look.

54:45.264 --> 54:48.934
Does it hurt?

54:50.168 --> 54:53.869
A little.
But it's okay.

54:53.871 --> 54:55.674
I want to live.

55:12.958 --> 55:15.758
Oh, no, I'm gonna be sick.

55:15.760 --> 55:18.662
Oh, come on, Warren.
Grow some balls.

55:18.664 --> 55:22.633
Oh God, oh, feels like
you're growing bigger.

55:22.635 --> 55:26.970
You're just so tight.
So tight.

55:26.972 --> 55:29.108
That's okay.

55:31.309 --> 55:34.681
Deeper. Get in there deeper.

55:39.918 --> 55:41.684
I feel something happening.

55:41.686 --> 55:44.123
Wider, open her wider.

55:55.333 --> 55:57.700
Yes, yes, yes.

55:57.702 --> 56:00.639
More, yes, fuck!
Fuck me hard and faster.

56:06.077 --> 56:07.813
She feels tight.

56:09.213 --> 56:11.180
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

56:32.204 --> 56:34.007
Fuck me, fuck me.

57:11.143 --> 57:12.476
I'm coming.

57:12.478 --> 57:15.181
- Lara!
- I'm coming.

57:19.016 --> 57:20.316
The chosen one has arrived!

57:20.318 --> 57:24.019
Hail, hail, hail!

57:32.097 --> 57:35.132
Damn. My first time
didn't sound like that.

57:35.134 --> 57:37.869
That's for sure. He was done
before we even got started.

57:46.445 --> 57:49.248
Oh, I found it! Yes!

57:52.784 --> 57:54.483
Great, let's get
the fuck out of here.

57:54.485 --> 57:57.854
All hail the chosen one!

57:57.856 --> 58:00.423
All hail the chosen one!

58:00.425 --> 58:01.861
I'll drive.

58:03.795 --> 58:06.031
All hail...

58:07.032 --> 58:08.965
Hail, hail!

58:08.967 --> 58:10.900
Hail, hail!

58:10.902 --> 58:13.235
Hail, hail!

58:13.237 --> 58:15.273
Sounds like a Trump rally
out there.

58:19.010 --> 58:21.811
Hey, guys, we found the key.

58:21.813 --> 58:22.945
Guys?

58:32.324 --> 58:34.927
Holy fucksticks!

58:43.268 --> 58:45.534
It's the dawn of a new day!

58:45.536 --> 58:48.871
It's a glorious day!

58:52.911 --> 58:53.913
Help me!

58:59.418 --> 59:02.385
- You son of a bitch!
- What's going on back there?

59:02.387 --> 59:03.956
Drive, drive, drive!

59:07.860 --> 59:11.193
All hail the chosen one.

59:11.195 --> 59:14.597
- All hail the chosen one.
- So long, freaks.

59:14.599 --> 59:18.434
All hail the chosen one.
All hail the chosen one.

59:18.436 --> 59:22.438
All hail the chosen one.

59:22.440 --> 59:24.543
All hail the chosen one.

59:29.981 --> 59:31.449
I think we're safe.

59:33.351 --> 59:35.922
You guys hear me?

59:38.422 --> 59:41.057
Hello back there?

59:41.059 --> 59:43.459
Will someone speak up?

59:43.461 --> 59:44.563
Shit!

59:51.003 --> 59:53.637
We, uh, we got a problem.

59:53.639 --> 59:55.541
What is it?

59:57.009 --> 59:58.441
The whole...

59:58.443 --> 01:00:01.577
Lara having sex
idea was a bad one.

01:00:01.579 --> 01:00:03.246
Why, what happened?

01:00:03.248 --> 01:00:06.416
I don't know.
A really bad form of puberty?

01:00:06.418 --> 01:00:08.517
We created a monster.

01:00:08.519 --> 01:00:11.420
Literally, she killed
Peter and Alan.

01:00:11.422 --> 01:00:12.891
What?

01:00:14.693 --> 01:00:18.028
- Where's Warren?
- The coward locked himself

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:20.996
- in the bathroom.
- Typical.

01:00:20.998 --> 01:00:22.432
Personally...

01:00:22.434 --> 01:00:24.668
...I don't know what
you see in that guy.

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:28.003
We started dating
in high school.

01:00:28.005 --> 01:00:31.074
First love.

01:00:31.076 --> 01:00:32.110
It's complicated.

01:00:33.378 --> 01:00:36.249
But not as
complicated as tonight.

01:00:38.317 --> 01:00:41.117
Mm, where is Lara?

01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:44.557
I think she's... eating.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.949
The bus is moving.

01:01:13.985 --> 01:01:18.420
Well, just have to deal with
some serious shit.

01:01:18.422 --> 01:01:20.657
Any idea
where we're heading?

01:01:20.659 --> 01:01:24.427
Not a clue, I just think any place
is better than where we were.

01:01:24.429 --> 01:01:26.662
Okay.

01:01:26.664 --> 01:01:30.666
No matter what happens,
just keep driving.

01:01:30.668 --> 01:01:32.237
What are you gonna do?

01:01:33.438 --> 01:01:34.440
Party's over.

01:01:46.284 --> 01:01:50.122
Yo razor face,
what you doing?

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:56.726
Lara,
are you still in there?

01:01:56.728 --> 01:01:58.530
Somewhere?

01:02:05.036 --> 01:02:09.738
Okay, okay, first thing I do
when I get back,

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:13.709
is I'm going to sue this bus company
for every penny that they're worth.

01:02:13.711 --> 01:02:18.148
And I demand a $400 refund
for my Burning Man tickets.

01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:21.083
Dump my...

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:26.391
...ex-girlfriend
out of my life.

01:02:27.793 --> 01:02:30.260
Call me a dildo.

01:02:30.262 --> 01:02:32.429
Fuck her.

01:02:32.431 --> 01:02:34.199
Fuck you, Reese!

01:03:01.626 --> 01:03:04.827
- Get away from me!
- It's me, Ivy, open up.

01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:07.764
- Go to hell!
- I think we're already there.

01:03:07.766 --> 01:03:10.266
Come on, I need your help.

01:03:10.268 --> 01:03:13.202
Is my ex-girlfriend
still alive?

01:03:13.204 --> 01:03:15.472
Yes, she is,
no thanks to you.

01:03:15.474 --> 01:03:17.706
Then get her to help you.

01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:19.744
She's busy driving the bus.

01:03:21.346 --> 01:03:24.546
Where is that... that thing?

01:03:24.548 --> 01:03:27.816
I managed to lock it in the
luggage compartment, but...

01:03:27.818 --> 01:03:29.619
I have my doubts it's going
to stay down there.

01:03:29.621 --> 01:03:31.887
So what do you want
me to do about it?

01:03:31.889 --> 01:03:34.257
- Help me kill it!
- Fuck that!

01:03:34.259 --> 01:03:37.526
I'm staying right here till we're
back in Vegas or at Burning Man.

01:03:37.528 --> 01:03:39.695
You're a real fucking pussy,
you know that?

01:03:39.697 --> 01:03:42.500
And you're a cunt,
so we're even!

01:03:46.905 --> 01:03:49.341
Warren? Warren, what
the fuck is going on?

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:53.345
Warren, get away
from the door.

01:03:57.282 --> 01:04:01.287
Nobody appreciates
the C-word.

01:04:08.793 --> 01:04:10.195
What's happening?

01:04:18.402 --> 01:04:21.306
- Oh, that's pretty gross.
- Talk to me!

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.242
Just keep driving!

01:04:34.452 --> 01:04:36.722
Jesus.

01:04:45.429 --> 01:04:47.365
What the hell just happened?

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.903
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

01:04:53.471 --> 01:04:54.706
Your boyfriend is dead.

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:57.209
And what's the bad news?

01:04:59.945 --> 01:05:03.579
Well, then no bad news.

01:05:03.581 --> 01:05:08.318
Lara, or the thing
that used to be Lara is gone.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.590
Busted out.
Flew the coop.

01:05:12.958 --> 01:05:15.925
But I managed to shoot it
a few times,

01:05:15.927 --> 01:05:18.931
so with any luck, it's out
there dying somewhere.

01:05:20.231 --> 01:05:22.498
Any signs of that cult?

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.400
Nope.

01:05:24.402 --> 01:05:26.804
Still don't
know where we're going.

01:05:28.974 --> 01:05:31.541
Well, it'll be light
in a few hours, so,

01:05:31.543 --> 01:05:33.943
we're bound
to wind up somewhere.

01:05:33.945 --> 01:05:37.512
Yeah. Somewhere that has
a hot bath, I hope.

01:05:37.514 --> 01:05:39.652
I'm all for that.

01:05:40.652 --> 01:05:43.253
And if they only have one,

01:05:43.255 --> 01:05:45.521
we could always share.

01:05:45.523 --> 01:05:50.793
Hey, Ivy, I agree
that Warren was kind of

01:05:50.795 --> 01:05:53.795
an asshole, but, I still
kind of favor men.

01:05:53.797 --> 01:05:57.967
- No offense.
- None taken.

01:05:57.969 --> 01:06:02.537
For some women,
it's an acquired taste.

01:06:02.539 --> 01:06:04.773
But it's okay, no pressure.

01:06:04.775 --> 01:06:06.608
- No.
- No, I mean it.

01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:09.278
- No. No, no, no!
- I mean it, I've never forced...

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.349
No!

01:06:15.753 --> 01:06:17.987
- We're out of gas.
- You're kidding.

01:06:17.989 --> 01:06:21.659
Yeah, yeah, this is absolutely something
I would joke about right now.

01:06:24.795 --> 01:06:28.563
- Now what?
- I don't know about you, but...

01:06:28.565 --> 01:06:31.867
the last thing I want to do is
wander around there at night.

01:06:31.869 --> 01:06:34.604
Yeah. I'm not big
on that choice either.

01:06:34.606 --> 01:06:37.373
So, I think we stay
here till morning,

01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:40.776
and then grab as much food
and water that we can carry

01:06:40.778 --> 01:06:43.378
and go out there
and try to find some help.

01:06:46.518 --> 01:06:50.452
Who knows, maybe we can
even get a few hours of sleep.

01:06:50.454 --> 01:06:52.889
- I am all for sleeping.
- Yeah.

01:06:52.891 --> 01:06:56.525
- And I do mean sleeping.
- Just sleeping.

01:06:56.527 --> 01:06:58.463
Right.

01:07:44.675 --> 01:07:47.445
Oh, Reese, I thought
you weren't into girls.

01:07:50.581 --> 01:07:54.016
Oh, my God.
Oh, fuck.

01:07:54.018 --> 01:07:56.885
Oh, Reese.

01:07:56.887 --> 01:07:59.588
Oh, where did you
learn to do that?

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:05.561
Oh, fuck.
Ow. Nibbling is cool.

01:08:09.434 --> 01:08:14.737
Oh, ow! Reese teeth,
not so cool.

01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:17.807
Oh, fuck.
Okay, seriously, the teeth.

01:08:26.551 --> 01:08:29.054
Jesus Christ.

01:08:33.122 --> 01:08:34.559
Reese?

01:08:50.175 --> 01:08:52.707
Oh, good, you're awake.

01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:54.113
I sure hope so.

01:08:57.515 --> 01:08:59.214
I don't see anything out here.

01:08:59.216 --> 01:09:02.518
We are absolutely
in the middle of nowhere.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.553
Are there
any backup gas cans on board?

01:09:04.555 --> 01:09:07.456
Nope. Already looked.

01:09:07.457 --> 01:09:10.526
Yep. We are empty.

01:09:10.528 --> 01:09:13.465
- So then, we're walking.
- Unless you have a better idea.

01:09:23.073 --> 01:09:24.941
Do you think they found us?

01:09:24.943 --> 01:09:27.009
I got three bullets left.

01:09:27.011 --> 01:09:28.881
I got the corkscrew
and the scissors.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:35.050
What if it is help?
What do we tell them?

01:09:35.051 --> 01:09:37.219
I don't know,
but I think trying to explain

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:40.089
the six dead bodies on board
is going to be a tough one.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:41.960
Just follow my lead.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.840
Morning ladies.

01:09:58.842 --> 01:10:01.744
- Morning.
- Having a little trouble?

01:10:01.746 --> 01:10:04.112
That's the understatement
of the year.

01:10:04.114 --> 01:10:06.115
- Who are you?
- Bob McCready.

01:10:06.117 --> 01:10:08.784
I'm with Sin City Party Buses.
Came to help.

01:10:08.786 --> 01:10:10.820
How did you find us?

01:10:10.822 --> 01:10:11.821
A LoJack.

01:10:11.823 --> 01:10:13.188
Our whole line has them

01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:14.757
so we can keep track
of where everyone is

01:10:14.759 --> 01:10:16.157
if they miss
their destination

01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:18.628
and/or they don't return
radio calls.

01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:21.129
Which is when they call out
the search party, which is me.

01:10:21.131 --> 01:10:23.469
Bob McCready, hi.

01:10:24.702 --> 01:10:26.869
So where's, uh,
where's Matilda?

01:10:26.871 --> 01:10:29.871
- Who?
- The bus driver? Matilda Getty?

01:10:29.873 --> 01:10:32.708
- Oh, right.
- Oh, yeah.

01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.111
- Oh, funny story.
- Um...

01:10:35.113 --> 01:10:37.914
Well, um, we ran out of gas.

01:10:37.916 --> 01:10:42.250
So Matilda just took all the
others to the nearest town.

01:10:42.252 --> 01:10:46.155
On foot? Because that's
20 miles from here.

01:10:46.157 --> 01:10:51.893
Really? Well, she's didn't want
to leave the bus unattended.

01:10:51.895 --> 01:10:54.597
So Reese and I volunteered
to stay behind.

01:10:54.599 --> 01:10:57.866
- Just the two of you?
- I'm afraid so.

01:10:57.868 --> 01:11:00.135
So how the hell
did you wind up out here?

01:11:00.137 --> 01:11:03.339
I don't know.
We weren't driving.

01:11:03.341 --> 01:11:05.607
I think she was trying to take
a shortcut or something.

01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:06.709
That's right.

01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:08.611
Never disobey the GPS,

01:11:08.613 --> 01:11:10.178
number one rule of the road.

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.616
Matilda should have
known better. Damn.

01:11:13.618 --> 01:11:15.750
This thing looks like it's
been through hell and back.

01:11:15.752 --> 01:11:17.053
That's the truth.

01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:19.187
Bet you two have
seen better days.

01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:21.156
We'd just really like
a ride to the closest town.

01:11:21.158 --> 01:11:23.092
Like now, if possible.

01:11:23.094 --> 01:11:25.160
Oh, no, no problem, I'll
just pull out your luggage.

01:11:25.162 --> 01:11:30.732
- Oh, no, no, no!
- All righty then.

01:11:30.734 --> 01:11:34.102
- Go back to civilization.
- Yes.

01:11:34.104 --> 01:11:35.840
Come on, I don't bite.

01:11:51.956 --> 01:11:54.123
Aren't you going
to call this in?

01:11:54.125 --> 01:11:58.361
Oh, sure, I just have to get to
an area where I get a signal.

01:11:58.363 --> 01:12:00.896
Well, isn't your GPS working?

01:12:00.898 --> 01:12:03.268
Oh, nothing works out here.

01:12:06.637 --> 01:12:09.004
Then how did you
locate us again?

01:12:09.006 --> 01:12:11.973
Whoops. You got me.

01:12:14.912 --> 01:12:16.211
And now we've got you.

01:12:16.213 --> 01:12:18.082
Fuck that!

01:12:27.158 --> 01:12:29.161
My one good eye!

01:12:48.979 --> 01:12:51.946
- You want me to drive?
- If you're up to it.

01:12:51.948 --> 01:12:54.051
I'm good.

01:13:11.335 --> 01:13:13.102
Help! Hey!

01:13:13.104 --> 01:13:15.007
Oh, shit!

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.876
Hello!

01:13:21.212 --> 01:13:23.715
There you are. I've been looking
everywhere for you guys.

01:13:24.981 --> 01:13:26.482
I thought you said
she was a monster.

01:13:26.484 --> 01:13:27.750
She is.

01:13:27.752 --> 01:13:30.352
- How many bullets left?
- None.

01:13:30.354 --> 01:13:32.455
Where are all the others?

01:13:32.457 --> 01:13:34.255
Don't you remember?

01:13:34.257 --> 01:13:36.927
I remember
we were on the bus...

01:13:38.462 --> 01:13:42.263
you all said I had
to have sex with Peter.

01:13:42.265 --> 01:13:45.034
Next thing I know I woke up in
the desert naked this morning.

01:13:45.036 --> 01:13:48.204
I found these cloths,

01:13:48.206 --> 01:13:50.106
put them on.

01:13:50.108 --> 01:13:52.010
So come on, let me in.

01:13:53.077 --> 01:13:54.445
One moment.

01:13:55.747 --> 01:13:57.412
Are you sure she's a monster?

01:13:57.414 --> 01:13:58.981
I mean, she doesn't...
look at her.

01:13:58.983 --> 01:14:00.182
I mean, are you sure?

01:14:00.184 --> 01:14:01.517
I'm positive, okay?

01:14:01.519 --> 01:14:05.120
She turned into this
winged demonic creature.

01:14:05.122 --> 01:14:08.891
She tore Peter to pieces,
ripped through Alan's heart,

01:14:08.893 --> 01:14:11.893
and only left an arm and a leg
of your boyfriend behind.

01:14:11.895 --> 01:14:14.129
What if she really, like,
doesn't remember any of that?

01:14:14.131 --> 01:14:16.331
What if she turns back
to normal in the daylight?

01:14:16.333 --> 01:14:18.500
You mean like a werewolf?

01:14:18.502 --> 01:14:21.035
We don't know how this whole
chosen one thing works.

01:14:21.037 --> 01:14:25.174
Really hot out here, guys,
I've been walking for hours!

01:14:25.176 --> 01:14:27.343
Please, just open the door.

01:14:27.345 --> 01:14:30.979
Lara, how are you feeling?

01:14:30.981 --> 01:14:33.982
Hot, tired, thirsty,

01:14:33.984 --> 01:14:36.451
confused, a little sore,

01:14:36.453 --> 01:14:40.156
massive hangover, scared,
worried, stressed out.

01:14:40.158 --> 01:14:43.495
Okay, okay, enough. Prove
to us you're not a demon.

01:14:45.162 --> 01:14:48.365
How do you prove
you're not a demon?

01:14:49.966 --> 01:14:52.269
She's got a point.

01:14:58.542 --> 01:15:01.309
Thanks for letting me
ride shotgun.

01:15:01.311 --> 01:15:05.246
- No problem.
- So, um, you're not feeling

01:15:05.248 --> 01:15:08.017
all powerful today?

01:15:08.019 --> 01:15:11.419
Not one bit.
Oh, look, a wolf dog.

01:15:17.295 --> 01:15:19.864
- Where?
- Never mind. It's gone.

01:15:21.832 --> 01:15:24.933
How about some music?

01:15:29.407 --> 01:15:32.543
- That's weird.
- I didn't even touch it.

01:15:43.954 --> 01:15:45.486
Looks like a storm's coming.

01:15:49.092 --> 01:15:50.862
Could be.

01:15:52.029 --> 01:15:53.862
Who's still up
for Burning Man?

01:15:53.864 --> 01:15:55.964
I mean I'm up for
it if you guys are.

01:15:55.966 --> 01:15:58.536
Well, we've come this far.
