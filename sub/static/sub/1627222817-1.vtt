WEBVTT

00:31.680 --> 00:35.320
..A big fella. He's got a massive
ginger beard.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.680
He's down in the pub all the time!

00:37.680 --> 00:40.680
No.
Oh, how do you not know this guy?

00:40.680 --> 00:43.840
Anyway, see if you see him,
ask him to show you the tattoo.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.080
Yeah, I'm not going to do that,

00:46.080 --> 00:48.200
so you may as well just tell me.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.040
Right, he wants a tattoo
of his girlfriend on his arm.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.320
So, he takes a photo of the two of
them from his mum's place

00:53.320 --> 00:55.280
down to the tattoo parlour.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.640
Now, halfway through the job,
he looks down,

00:57.640 --> 01:00.400
and it's his mum that's getting
tattooed on his arm.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.480
Shut up! No, I swear, mate!

01:03.680 --> 01:05.640
Right, troops, I'm sick of stacking
these fish.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.120
One of yous come and take over.
Louis, you're up, man.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.000
Nice, little shoal under us.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.560
Where's Miller hiding, man?
He's always skiving.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.240
Aye, he'll be sitting on his

01:14.560 --> 01:17.240
phone, the skiver.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.520
What was that?! I don't know.
Check the side.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.680
We're fast!

01:28.680 --> 01:31.240
The wire's tight. Boss, we're stuck!
I said we're fast.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
It won't stop!

01:34.720 --> 01:37.280
Captain, you've got to do
something. Get the bolt-cutters!

01:37.280 --> 01:40.120
Went over the side,
check the red box.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.920
There's cutters in there.
Where is it?

01:43.360 --> 01:46.200
It's jammed, Captain! Cut the wire!

01:46.200 --> 01:48.480
We're caught on something!

01:48.480 --> 01:51.120
Cut the wire before it
pulls us down!

01:51.120 --> 01:53.240
Captain, we're stuck!

01:53.240 --> 01:54.720
Water's coming in.

01:54.720 --> 01:55.880
It's dragging us!

02:18.880 --> 02:21.480
Sir, incoming message from CTF.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.520
Are we close up on the broadcast?
Yes, sir.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.120
Is there no intel signal?
No, nothing, sir.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.960
Mm. Carry on. Pump two tonnes from
M's and O's to C.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.320
We're being dragged under!

02:49.320 --> 02:51.360
Guys, hold on, hold on!

02:54.800 --> 02:58.520
Cut the wire! We can't!
The cutters are gone.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.720
Miller, get up here! Captain!

03:02.720 --> 03:04.440
Get the raft off!

03:04.440 --> 03:06.840
I can't hold on. Give us your hand!
I can't hold on!

03:13.280 --> 03:15.480
Sir, I think I've got something.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.200
Permission to put the sound
on loud-speaker? Go ahead.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.720
What is that?

03:24.720 --> 03:27.200
I think it's a trawler, sir.
We were tracking one.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.880
Yes, but what's happening to it?

03:28.880 --> 03:30.640
Where's Miller?

03:30.640 --> 03:31.840
Get the jackets out!

03:40.040 --> 03:43.240
Did it collide with something?
There's nothing else for miles.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.400
Those are depth implosions.
It's gone down really fast.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.680
Should we go up, sir?
How close was it to us?

03:48.680 --> 03:50.920
Close. I'd say less than a mile.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.920
What kind of size trawler?
Mid-size.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.080
Maybe six crew.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.040
Is it us? No, sir.
And you can't tell me what happened?

03:57.040 --> 03:59.240
It was very sudden.
There's a lot of impact noise.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.520
It's going to take time to
analyse... We don't have time.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.320
Could it have been another
submarine?

04:03.320 --> 04:05.160
If it was, we didn't hear it.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.560
Silent routine.
Revolutions two zero.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.600
Officer of the watch, I have
the submarine.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.800
Ship control, port ten.
Aye, sir, port ten.

04:19.640 --> 04:22.280
Sir, they won't have had time to
radio. It happened too fast.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.600
Face front. Do your job.
We have to go up and help.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.000
Cronin, go and get the coxswain.
Shake Kierly. Aye, sir.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.640
Well, what about the Antares?
A whole crew left to drown.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.280
You are unable to tell me what
happened. Without that information,

04:32.280 --> 04:33.800
I have to prioritise caution.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.040
Sit down. We know there'll be men in
the water up there.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.920
Hey! Hey! Do your fucking job!

04:45.520 --> 04:48.240
You wanted to see me, sir? Yeah,
Coxswain. Get him out of here.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.120
Get Kierly on watch.
She's on her way, sir.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.440
You're going to let them die?
Chief Petty Officer Burke,

04:52.440 --> 04:55.120
obey your orders! And you'll talk to
their wives and kids, eh?

04:55.120 --> 04:57.360
Get Burke out of here.
Come on, out you go. Out you go.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.960
Get him out of here.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.680
Bye, shipwreck.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.160
Kierly, get on this.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.720
Find out what happened, please.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.720
Yes, sir.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.920
What are we doing here?
Back to your bunk and cool off.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.440
# Do you want me on your mind?

05:47.440 --> 05:52.760
# Or do you want me to go on?

05:56.120 --> 06:02.680
# I might be yours
as sure as I can say

06:02.680 --> 06:06.680
# Be gone, be far away

06:09.400 --> 06:13.960
# Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

06:16.800 --> 06:22.520
# Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

06:22.520 --> 06:26.200
# Mm-mm-mm... #

06:29.840 --> 06:32.080
Chief Petty Officer Kierly,

06:32.080 --> 06:34.040
please report to the captain's
quarters.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.520
Chief Petty Officer Kierly, please
report to the captain's quarters.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.360
Sir. Enter.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.520
What have you got on the sinking?

06:43.520 --> 06:45.280
This is the beginning of the event.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.160
That's the trawler's engine
signature - low and steady.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.640
And here,

06:50.640 --> 06:54.200
it looks like an impact caused by
a major hull breach.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.800
But it could also have been
an explosion.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.600
I've only had an hour, sir. This is
going to take... Sir.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.680
I want you and Burke working on this
until you have a definitive answer.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.000
Sir. Shall I shake Burke, sir?
Please.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.280
Get the doctor!

07:15.280 --> 07:17.520
I think he's gone into
cardiac arrest.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.240
Casualty, casualty, casualty!
MC level three, port side.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.800
16 mess. Repeat. Casualty, casualty.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.480
Where is she?

07:26.480 --> 07:29.160
Ah, Christ. What happened? I don't
know. I just found him like that.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.640
Come on, mate!

07:30.640 --> 07:32.120
Come on, Craig!

07:32.120 --> 07:34.520
What's going on?
We found him in cardiac arrest.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.600
How long has he been like this?

07:36.600 --> 07:38.880
Is his chest expanding?
I think he's gone.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.000
Is his airway free? I'll look, do
you want to swap?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.720
Keep going. Keep going.
Do you want to swap? Let me at it.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.600
One and two and three and four.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.920
Come on, man. Come on!

07:48.200 --> 07:49.760
Defib! How long shall we keep going?

07:49.760 --> 07:51.200
That's it, that's it.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.240
One, two, three, four, five, six,

07:53.240 --> 07:54.240
seven, eight...

08:42.120 --> 08:44.120
Prepare to return to periscope
depth. Aye, sir.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.960
Prepare to return to
periscope depth.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.040
Watch Stand Two, prepare to return
to periscope depth.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.320
Cronin, prepare to transmit
a message. Aye, sir.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.480
Amy Silva. Amy, you need to come in
right away.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.720
OK. Have I got time for a shower?

09:30.560 --> 09:32.480
Evening. Amy.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.960
Sir, who else is coming in?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.360
Just you.

09:44.040 --> 09:47.360
Rear Admiral Shaw,
this is DCI Amy Silva.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.280
She's my best detective.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.240
I would even say that to her face.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.760
Well, we'll get straight into it,
if you don't mind.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.640
I have charge of Britain's four
Vanguard-class submarines.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.160
These are the ones with
the nuclear deterrent.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.560
HMS Vigil is one of those boats.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.160
Earlier today, one of her crew
died of a drugs overdose.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.760
What kind of overdose?

10:09.760 --> 10:11.520
They think he snorted heroin.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.400
Snorted it? So is that misadventure
or a deliberate overdose?

10:15.400 --> 10:18.080
All we know is that he was found
dead in his bunk.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.200
Unfortunately, this happened within
British territorial waters,

10:21.200 --> 10:23.320
so we've had to bring it to you.

10:23.320 --> 10:26.840
Yes, it's been the MOD versus
Holyrood all evening.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.600
But the upshot is, the usual
rules apply.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.880
We're to look into it.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.440
When's the submarine due back?

10:33.480 --> 10:35.320
She's not coming back.

10:35.320 --> 10:38.680
At any given moment, one of these
boats is out on active patrol,

10:38.680 --> 10:40.480
ready to fire within 15 minutes.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.560
It's been that way for over
50 years.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.120
We're not going to abandon it
over one man's mistake

10:45.120 --> 10:47.280
and some bureaucratic bullshit.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.840
So, we're to send a detective out
to join HMS Vigil.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.680
Me? You'll be on board
for three days,

10:54.680 --> 10:58.800
finish your paperwork, then they'll
let you off on a raft.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.480
A raft? Yes, it's perfectly safe.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.800
Unless you get hit by a tanker.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.040
What's the dead man's name?

11:08.040 --> 11:10.280
Chief Petty Officer Craig Burke.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.680
These are his service records
and his health records.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.240
Thank you. I'm Lieutenant Commander
Erin Branning.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.400
I'll be the police's
point of contact.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.360
And if I need to interview anyone
under caution, will I fly

11:21.360 --> 11:23.480
a solicitor out to be with
them or...?

11:23.480 --> 11:25.440
Yes, it's a flawed plan, I agree.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.400
Ordinarily, if a crewman died on
board, we'd stow him away

11:29.400 --> 11:30.840
and...get on with it.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.320
But we have our orders.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.680
The crew will, of course,
be told to co-operate.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.400
So, take a look around, see what
his mates knew.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.360
See if there was any bullying going
on... Zero tolerance of bullying

11:41.360 --> 11:45.680
in the Navy. You had problems with
drugs on these submarines before?

11:45.680 --> 11:48.200
We've never had an overdose before.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.360
That's not quite what I asked.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.320
There is no drugs problem on Vigil.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.320
We fly this body out at
the same time.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.360
Get an autopsy done.
We could look into that.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.800
And if I need to speak to
Superintendent Robertson...

12:01.800 --> 12:03.120
Can't call home.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.760
You can receive messages,

12:04.760 --> 12:07.400
but the boat won't signal
unless it's an emergency.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.560
It gives away its position.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.640
Your luggage will need to fit
into this.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.600
It's Silva. L-V-A.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.520
Sorry. Short notice.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.800
No problem.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.040
I'm not going there to assess
the Navy's competence.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.560
How are you with confined spaces?

12:26.560 --> 12:28.480
Amy will get the job done,

12:28.480 --> 12:30.920
don't you worry about that,
Lieutenant Commander Branning.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.680
I don't think they'll be rolling
out the red carpet.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.800
I mean, that's why it had to be you.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.640
You'll be OK?

12:46.160 --> 12:47.840
It's three days.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.600
Yeah, it's fine.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.800
Burke passed a mandatory
drugs test in July.

12:55.800 --> 12:56.920
It just...

12:58.560 --> 13:00.760
..doesn't fit the profile of a user.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.560
No. No.

13:02.560 --> 13:07.680
I'm going to need a junior to speak
to Burke's colleagues and friends.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.320
Someone who can radio me leads.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.520
Aye, that makes sense.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.360
So, I was thinking Kirsten Longacre.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.000
Isn't she doing missing persons?
Yeah, but...

13:18.880 --> 13:20.880
If I can't send messages back,

13:20.880 --> 13:22.560
I'm going to need someone
who knows me,

13:22.560 --> 13:25.200
and I've got a good shorthand
with Kirsten.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.960
OK.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.240
Live from Westminster,

13:42.240 --> 13:44.240
we hear from both sides on
the upcoming

13:44.240 --> 13:46.080
Trident Missile renewal debate,

13:46.080 --> 13:48.600
and the families from the fishing
village Kellan are asking

13:48.600 --> 13:50.960
the coastguard to broaden
the search for a trawler...

13:50.960 --> 13:52.640
So, did you volunteer for this?

13:52.640 --> 13:54.920
The boat went missing off
the coast of Barra Head. No.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.920
Could you have said no?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.640
Well, that didn't come up, so...

14:03.200 --> 14:05.120
It's three days. I can do that.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.680
I used to come out here a lot.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.080
Iain's parents live a few miles
down the road.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.920
What else do you need from me?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.320
Look, anything you can get on Burke.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.280
Any drugs connections.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.440
I've emailed you a police report.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.640
Burke had a fight in a pub
near the base.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.280
There were no charges,
but could be worth looking into.

14:52.280 --> 14:55.440
And, remember, any messages that
you send me

14:55.440 --> 14:58.040
are going to be read by a dozen
people so... So, what?

14:58.040 --> 14:59.600
Nothing erotic, then?

15:07.160 --> 15:09.760
Do you mind staying at my flat
while I'm gone?

15:09.760 --> 15:11.480
Your flat, why? Just for the cat.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.680
You know what she's like
when I'm away.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.480
What the hell is that?

15:36.480 --> 15:37.840
Is that a body?

15:37.840 --> 15:39.520
Oh, shit.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.520
Call it in.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.040
I'm a police officer. I need an
ambulance.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.240
Erm, we're on the road not far from
the Dunloch naval base.

15:57.240 --> 16:01.040
Each Trident missile costs
$66 million and... It's fine!

16:01.040 --> 16:03.880
Sorry. False alarm. Get up now!
Westminster's about to spend

16:03.880 --> 16:05.920
hundreds of millions more
upgrading them...

16:05.920 --> 16:08.080
If someone swerves to avoid you,
they could end up dead. Ow!

16:08.080 --> 16:10.000
Leave her alone! You talk about
killing people -

16:10.000 --> 16:11.760
do you not see the irony there?

16:11.760 --> 16:14.240
Amy? We're going to be late.
Dunloch is in charge of the end

16:14.240 --> 16:16.760
of the world, and they're lying to
us. So speak to your MP.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.240
It's all falling apart, nobody's
doing anything. Here.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.800
You getting run over helps nobody.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.120
Well, it helps me sleep at night!
What about you?

16:51.160 --> 16:53.400
Names, please? DC Kirsten Longacre.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.280
DCI Silva. Amy.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.880
Thanks.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.600
Hello, again. Hey.
Welcome to Dunloch.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.800
If you want to follow me, please.
We need to get you briefed

17:05.800 --> 17:07.680
and into your helicopter
survival suit.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.520
If you're taking your phone on
board,

17:09.520 --> 17:12.480
you need to remove the SIM card.
Yep. Already done it.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.080
Follow me, please.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.160
Look, if you need to tell me
anything and you don't want

17:54.160 --> 17:56.480
to flag it to the Navy, then maybe
just reference

17:56.480 --> 17:59.000
things we've done together.
Like what?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.520
I don't know. Places we've been.
People we know.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.720
DCI Silva, this is Chief Petty
Officer Matthew Doward. Hi. Ma'am.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.280
He'll be flying out with you, to
replace Craig Burke.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.000
If you wait here, I'll just check
they're ready. Thank you.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.520
It's not going to be for long.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.880
Come here.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.480
I'm sorry.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.440
You can't say that now.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.840
They're ready for you.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.120
Wait here.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.560
Let's go!

19:05.920 --> 19:08.360
Fuel feed confidence check.
Cross-feed confirmed.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.680
Hatches and doors, and we're clear
for take-off checks.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.080
Front door is good,
all brakes are off.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.520
We're clear on final.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.640
Have you served on Vigil before?

19:47.480 --> 19:49.760
No. But I've trained with a few
of them.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.520
My usual boat is Virtue.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.280
Much less trouble.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.440
How's that?

19:57.000 --> 20:00.160
No offence, but I'm not really
supposed to be talking to you.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.520
Why not?

20:44.080 --> 20:46.120
Amy, are you ready to rock,
sweetheart?

20:46.120 --> 20:49.480
I think it's going to rain.
Have you got your thermals?

20:49.480 --> 20:51.160
Poppy!

20:51.160 --> 20:52.720
I can't find my hat!

20:54.960 --> 20:57.480
Right, you about ready? Do you know
what I've done with...?

20:57.480 --> 21:00.920
Flask there. OK, let's go. I've done
snacks. OK. No, no, no, no.

21:00.920 --> 21:06.440
Got games. You just need your hat,
which I've found under my coat.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.400
OK. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

21:28.080 --> 21:30.200
Roger, this is
Nine November Sierra.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.080
We are at RV point seven-five
degrees, two-two decimal

21:33.080 --> 21:38.400
two-six north. One-one degrees,
zero-one decimal five-seven west.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.880
Relative red two-zero at ten
knots. Over.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.960
We've arrived. Coming up on
RV transfer location.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.400
So, how long do we wait?

21:46.400 --> 21:48.640
RV location two-seven clicks north.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.480
We can stay until fuel's a problem.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.360
Roger, we have visual on boat.

22:12.840 --> 22:16.120
Nine November Sierra, commencing
highline transfer.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.400
Arms up, please!

22:19.920 --> 22:21.320
She's off comm.

22:23.160 --> 22:27.200
Five, four, three, two, steady...

22:35.760 --> 22:38.560
I'm going to take you to
the door. OK.

22:57.640 --> 23:01.160
Listen, do not get caught
under the wire!

23:01.160 --> 23:04.600
And, remember, don't move your arm
or you'll fall out of the harness.

23:07.240 --> 23:10.080
On three, push out and away.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.080
Do not jump up.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.280
On three.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.680
One, two, three! Go!

23:44.000 --> 23:45.560
Line unclipped!

23:45.560 --> 23:47.480
Get down the hatch quickly.

23:47.480 --> 23:48.920
Watch your step!

23:56.920 --> 23:58.080
Keep moving!

24:06.880 --> 24:09.520
Close conning tower, upper lid.
Aye, sir.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.120
Where should I...? Wait there.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.080
DCI Silva. Commander Mark Prentice.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.880
Get your suit off in there. Coxswain
will be along to see you shortly.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.640
Burke's body was meant to be taken
off. Well, too late for that.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.040
Welcome to Vigil.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.120
Officer of the watch,
look out.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.720
Chief Petty Officer Doward
and civilian detective on board.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.120
Conning tower upper lid shut
and clipped.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.400
Conning tower lower lid
shut and clipped.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.600
Alter course, ten degrees to port.
Aye, sir.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.440
Alter course ten degrees to port.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.800
Officer of the watch,
dive the submarine.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.640
Excuse me. Thanks. Sir.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.000
Elliot Glover, coxswain.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.200
Tea? DCI Amy Silva.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.600
Where's Craig Burke? No, thanks.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.120
He's in the, er...
He's in the bomb shop.

25:31.120 --> 25:35.160
Right. Well, I'm going to have
to examine the body.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.760
Right. Well, follow me.
Does this ship have a doctor?

25:38.760 --> 25:41.200
Would you take that for me?
Thank you.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.520
It's a boat.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.400
A submarine's always a boat.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.960
And, yeah, we've Medical Officer
Lieutenant Docherty.

25:46.960 --> 25:49.440
Well, can you have him come
and assist me?

25:49.440 --> 25:50.880
Our Doctor's a "her".

25:50.880 --> 25:53.400
We're eight women, 140 men.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.600
You can help to even things up.
Excuse me.

25:55.600 --> 25:56.920
What's the bomb shop?

25:56.920 --> 25:58.640
It's where we keep the torpedoes.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.680
Oh, you all right? Ow!

26:01.680 --> 26:04.160
If you're not covered in bruises
in the first week,

26:04.160 --> 26:05.720
you're not moving fast enough.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.760
How big is this thing?

26:08.760 --> 26:11.400
It's about the length of two
football pitches and about as tall

26:11.400 --> 26:12.760
as four double-decker buses.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.840
All right, I'm going to need a map.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.760
Here, give me your bag.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.960
I'll take that. Thanks. No worries.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.560
This is the main event.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.560
Know what's in these?

26:23.560 --> 26:25.760
£50 million-worth
of nuclear missiles.

26:25.760 --> 26:28.360
That's the real reason there aren't
many nuclear wars.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.920
Can't afford to replace these.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.960
Lieutenant Docherty, could you mind
assisting DCI Silva?

26:32.960 --> 26:35.680
This is our doctor, our surgeon
and, God help us,

26:35.680 --> 26:39.040
our dentist, if need be, Medical
Officer Lieutenant Tiffany Docherty.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.720
Welcome aboard. How was your flight?
Stay there. Aye, sir.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.560
I got thrown out of an aircraft
with my luggage tied to me.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.320
Still, better than Ryanair.

26:46.320 --> 26:49.240
But you're all right? You're not
injured? What, me? No.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.600
No, I need you to help me
examine Craig Burke.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.240
He was supposed to be flown off.
Right. I'll go get my kit then

26:54.240 --> 26:57.240
and I'll see you down there.
All right. Follow me. This way.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.320
How have the crew been? It's been
tricky, you know,

26:59.320 --> 27:00.800
but they're all professionals,

27:00.800 --> 27:03.320
they've all got a job to do, so...
Mind your head.

27:04.520 --> 27:07.280
How well did you know Craig Burke?
Reasonably. I liked him.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.560
Though it'd been a while since we
served together.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.520
And what do you do?

27:11.520 --> 27:13.400
Coxswain's job is to take care
of people.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.960
Welfare, discipline, morale.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.720
I'm a walking HR department.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.480
Do you think he meant to
kill himself?

27:34.240 --> 27:36.880
Well, he took an overdose,
so it looks like it.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.680
Welcome to the bomb shop.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.640
Where's the body?

27:49.640 --> 27:51.080
Lads.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.720
We could've put him in the galley
freezer, but it's full of food.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.520
The torpedo tube isn't insulated

27:58.520 --> 28:00.560
and sea water's about four degrees,

28:00.560 --> 28:02.800
so the body should still
be in good condition.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.480
Right, now, up top. Nobody in.
Aye, sir.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.440
Go ahead.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.080
Did you do much work on him?

28:24.080 --> 28:27.320
Uh, they'd started doing CPR,
but he was clearly dead.

28:33.720 --> 28:34.840
Who found him?

28:34.840 --> 28:36.440
Engineering Officer Hadlow.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.720
He's new to Vigil.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.760
Been on attack boats up till now.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.840
I'll need to speak to him.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.080
Of course. Do you have a torch?

28:55.120 --> 28:57.840
Will that be admissible as evidence?

28:57.840 --> 28:59.200
It'll further the case.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.840
As for the rest...

29:03.320 --> 29:05.200
..that's up to the courts to decide.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.720
Without a full postmortem,
it's not ideal.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.760
Had he taken any other medication?

29:12.760 --> 29:15.840
I gave him a couple of paracetamol
about an hour before he died.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.160
I ran into him and he said he had
a headache.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.800
Did he present with any other
symptoms

29:19.800 --> 29:21.400
that fit with a drugs overdose?

29:21.400 --> 29:24.960
His pupils were contracted and there
was some spittle round his mouth.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.440
There's a bruise with some bleeding.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.320
It's at the base of his skull.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.360
Did you not see that?

29:39.360 --> 29:41.040
He was dead when I got there.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.320
Airway was clear of obstruction,
paddles failed, CPR failed,

29:44.320 --> 29:45.440
no pulse.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.800
I called it, and they moved him
in here immediately.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.440
Could that have happened when they
pulled him from his bunk?

29:50.440 --> 29:53.200
Yeah, probably cracked a few ribs,
too. Mm-hm. We worked hard.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.080
Did you train in medicine?

29:55.080 --> 29:58.000
I did two years, medical school.
It wasn't for me.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.880
What made you change your mind?

30:03.160 --> 30:04.800
Right, you can put him back.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.480
Can you make sure no-one else can
access the body? Of course.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.320
I need to see the captain.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.120
I'll see if he's available.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.080
No. I need to see him straight away.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.160
Right.

30:19.880 --> 30:22.360
I think Craig Burke may have
been murdered.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.840
But that's absurd.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.480
We found drugs on the body,
with a rolled-up banknote.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.120
I've put them in the safe.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.720
I mean, you can see for yourself.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.720
The heroin looks like the type that
you cook up before injecting.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.720
Heroin's very rarely snorted,

30:36.720 --> 30:40.480
and if it is, they usually use
a finer white powder.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.800
Well, perhaps he didn't know what
he was doing.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.280
After all, he did overdose.

30:44.280 --> 30:47.560
There's powder on the body, and it's
caked around the nostrils,

30:47.560 --> 30:49.600
but there's nothing up inside
the nose.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.480
It looks like it's been rubbed on.
OK, hold on.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.920
There were at least half a dozen
people who tried to help him,

30:53.920 --> 30:56.280
including those people who held
his nose shut

30:56.280 --> 30:58.480
while they were giving him
mouth-to-mouth. So...

30:58.480 --> 31:01.440
Sir, sorry, I agree with you.
I think the idea of murder is...

31:01.440 --> 31:03.160
..is absurd. There's a head injury.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.280
And he complained of a headache
to your doctor

31:05.280 --> 31:07.160
a few hours before he died.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.880
And there's bruising around the jaw.

31:09.880 --> 31:13.480
It's possible that an assault
could've caused a delayed

31:13.480 --> 31:14.880
brain haemorrhage.

31:14.880 --> 31:17.680
That fits with the symptoms that
Lieutenant Docherty observed.

31:17.680 --> 31:20.280
I think the heroin might be someone
trying to cover some things up.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.560
And do you think someone brought
the heroin on board with

31:22.560 --> 31:24.800
all of that in mind?
There's no privacy on this boat.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.320
You can't beat someone to death
in their cabin and get away with it.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.240
Precisely! That's a nine-berth bunk.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.760
I did say there could be
a delay between the assault

31:31.760 --> 31:34.640
and the haemorrhage. If you'd have
flown the body back for an autopsy,

31:34.640 --> 31:36.920
like I requested...
We received no such order.

31:38.920 --> 31:42.040
With all due respect, Captain,
it isn't my job to persuade you.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.080
In my view, this boat is
a crime scene.

31:44.080 --> 31:47.520
You need to return to port so that
we can start a proper enquiry.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.880
I was promised your cooperation.

31:49.880 --> 31:53.000
I take my orders from the Chiefs
of Staff and the Prime Minister.

31:54.520 --> 31:58.040
My duty is to mission,
boat and crew,

31:58.040 --> 32:01.560
and while you are on board
you will obey my orders.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.120
Now, you're with us for three days.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.920
Do your work.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.800
But stay out of our way.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.720
And if I hear the word "murder"
spoken outside this room,

32:10.720 --> 32:12.760
I'll have you confined to quarters.

32:12.760 --> 32:13.760
I can't have that.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.600
Do you understand?

32:19.920 --> 32:21.680
Yeah. Coxswain.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.040
Don't tell me.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.400
You're hungry.

33:18.960 --> 33:22.000
Burke had a fight in a pub.
Do you know anything about that?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.200
If it happens on shore,
then it's none of my business.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.320
I'm just trying to understand
what's going on with him.

33:27.320 --> 33:29.640
When did you last see Burke?

33:29.640 --> 33:31.600
Erm, at the end of his watch.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.560
Where did he go? I'm not sure.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.640
Oh, Adams had a word with him
in the mess.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.640
He's one of our engineers.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.640
He's the guy who gave him CPR.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.880
So, that's who found him?

33:41.880 --> 33:44.000
No, that was, um, Lieutenant Hadlow.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.120
OK, I'll need to speak to
both of them,

33:46.120 --> 33:48.360
and now I need to see Burke's cabin.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.680
That was Burke's bunk.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.320
Is there anywhere else he might have
kept...? Twat!

34:03.320 --> 34:05.080
What the fuck is going on?

34:05.080 --> 34:07.360
Sorry, sir. No offence.

34:07.360 --> 34:10.320
None taken. This is Gary Walsh,
another of our engineers.

34:10.320 --> 34:13.880
This is DCI Silva. She's here just
to look into Burke's death.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.960
Well, there's not much to say,
is there?

34:15.960 --> 34:17.920
He was a druggie and a shite sailor,

34:17.920 --> 34:20.080
and he should've been out the Navy
years ago.

34:21.600 --> 34:25.080
How do you know he was a druggie?
Well, he OD'd for a start! Christ.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.680
Did you see him take drugs?

34:26.680 --> 34:29.120
It's not like he'd be racking up
lines in the mess. OK.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.880
Shall we do this another time?
He's meant to be sleeping.

34:38.080 --> 34:40.080
Is there anything else you need to
see in here?

34:43.320 --> 34:44.480
No, I'm done.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.520
I need to see Adams and Hadlow.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.040
I don't understand why the captain
doesn't want me to look into this.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.720
How are you feeling?

34:53.720 --> 34:55.440
I'm fine. I'm just...

34:55.440 --> 34:58.200
Headache? Yeah, actually.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.160
Yeah, it's the low-oxygen
environment.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.720
Helps slow down fires.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.400
Look, I think you need some rest.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.120
Let me show you to your bunk.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.720
All right. It's an automatic
disciplinary if I step into

35:18.720 --> 35:21.760
the ladies' bunks, so you'll have to
put yourself to bed.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.080
Yours is the top bunk.
Try and get four hours.

36:39.680 --> 36:42.160
Where is she now?
In the ladies' bunk.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.960
What do you think of her?

36:47.440 --> 36:49.120
She's clever.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.320
Once she starts talking to people,
it'll be hard to keep her contained.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.200
Well, I think we need to keep her
on a short lead,

36:56.200 --> 36:59.160
and, um, well, I can sit in on
any interviews.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.000
That's not a bad idea. Mm.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.120
But, Coxswain, I think we'll let you
cover that.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.400
Sir, I really think it should be me
who sits in on...

37:07.400 --> 37:09.240
Those are my orders, XO,

37:09.240 --> 37:11.360
and now I need a word with
the coxswain.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.120
Sir.

37:24.440 --> 37:27.800
I'm not going to saddle her with
that prick for three days.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.760
You'll keep an eye on her,
won't you?

37:29.760 --> 37:31.240
We can't afford a scandal.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.480
No, sir. We can't.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.640
Excuse me!

38:10.640 --> 38:12.560
Can we have a word with you?

38:14.480 --> 38:16.400
Stop!

38:16.400 --> 38:17.520
Stop!

38:20.360 --> 38:22.040
Hand it over.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.440
Hiya.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.360
Can't you sleep?

38:39.200 --> 38:41.200
No.

38:41.200 --> 38:44.120
It's hard keeping
track of time down here.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.960
Your body clock goes.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.960
Oh, shit.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.000
Oh, it's all right.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.800
You can't lose anything
on a submarine.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.560
Sorry. I didn't bring any spares.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.160
You can't carry your own meds.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.800
What's this for?

39:17.640 --> 39:19.760
I need to know about any medical
conditions.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.280
Anxiety and depression.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.960
What I need is to go for a run.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.960
Yeah, then a dip in the pool.

39:34.240 --> 39:38.080
Listen, if you're struggling,
come and see me.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.440
You wouldn't be the first.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.480
Thanks.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.640
Hi, Jade.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.440
I think we met earlier on the road
to Dunloch.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.280
I'd love to have a wee chat with you

40:06.280 --> 40:08.520
but if you'd like to have
a solicitor present...

40:08.520 --> 40:11.200
I've had my phone call.
I don't need anything else.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.720
OK, then.

40:15.240 --> 40:18.800
So, I gather that you've been
arrested for trespassing onto

40:18.800 --> 40:22.240
Dunloch base? I've been charged with
that before. It's no big deal.

40:22.240 --> 40:25.520
The report says that you were found
in one of the accommodation blocks

40:25.520 --> 40:27.400
and that you had a key on you?

40:27.400 --> 40:30.240
Yeah, they've taken that off me now.
Well, I bet they have. Mm.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.080
Why were you trying to get into
Craig Burke's room?

40:38.160 --> 40:40.120
You've read my statement.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.160
I have read your statement.
Now, what did it say?

40:42.160 --> 40:44.880
It said that he had borrowed a book
from you

40:44.880 --> 40:47.120
and that you went there to get
it back from him.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.240
Tell me, how did you know
each other?

40:51.240 --> 40:53.520
Drank in the same pub.

40:53.520 --> 40:56.320
What, and he just left you a key
to his room, did he?

40:56.320 --> 40:58.520
He's dead anyway,
doesn't really matter.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.360
Who told you he was dead?

41:03.440 --> 41:05.360
Did they tell you HOW he died?

41:08.440 --> 41:09.680
No.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.000
Jade, I'm a police detective.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.840
Now, that is totally separate
from the Navy.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.920
We do not share information
with them.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.280
I'm helping investigate his death.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.240
What, and you know how he died?

41:28.960 --> 41:30.440
I do.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.200
All right. How did he die?

41:45.200 --> 41:47.280
What was your relationship?

41:57.720 --> 41:59.800
He was my boyfriend.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.120
Nobody knew.

42:02.520 --> 42:06.720
Obviously, my friends,
my mates, wouldn't be happy.

42:13.520 --> 42:14.960
Go on, then.

42:17.520 --> 42:20.160
He died of a heroin overdose.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.240
Oh, my God.

42:28.360 --> 42:31.200
Oh, my God.
Did you know that he used...? What?

42:32.560 --> 42:34.280
He never took heroin!

42:34.280 --> 42:36.240
Addicts often hide, even
from their...

42:36.240 --> 42:38.080
He wasn't an addict!

42:38.080 --> 42:40.160
Are you...? Are you joking?

42:40.160 --> 42:43.680
He wasn't an addict!
I spent weekends with him.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.800
We were together every
single second.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.280
He couldn't...

42:53.480 --> 42:56.400
If that's what they're saying...

42:56.400 --> 42:58.960
..then it's the Navy that
killed him. The Na...

42:58.960 --> 43:02.560
Why would you say that? Look at when
the Mhairi Finnea went missing.

43:02.560 --> 43:05.280
The Mhairi Finnea?
You've not read up on that?

43:05.280 --> 43:07.320
No, I haven't.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.200
Everyone knows it's a cover-up.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.760
This is the Navy, yeah?

43:13.760 --> 43:15.600
This is what they do.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.760
This is what they do when they
have a problem.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.600
Oh, my God. Erm...

43:21.600 --> 43:23.640
Fuck. I need to go. Erm...

43:23.640 --> 43:25.720
Can I go now, please? Yes, you can.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.720
DCI Silva,
Chief Petty Officer Adams.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.480
I'd rather we talked in private.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.880
Best you're going to get,
I'm afraid. Adams, sit down.

44:33.520 --> 44:35.600
I've no time for a long one, mate.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.160
Yeah, go on, then.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.880
All right, fella? No, I'm just
a bit under it.

44:39.880 --> 44:42.760
It's all right, though.
What's the question?

44:42.760 --> 44:45.880
I gather you were one of the last
people to see Burke alive?

44:45.880 --> 44:48.080
Yeah. Yeah. I saw him in here.

44:48.080 --> 44:49.880
What time was that?

44:49.880 --> 44:52.000
I don't know exactly.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.080
13.10 maybe? Him and me do the same
watch pattern.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.480
Did the same watch pattern.

44:59.480 --> 45:01.960
Yeah, I got some scran, and then
went and had a kip.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.560
How did he seem? Did you talk?
No. He was a bit off.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.920
If you get a vibe off someone,
you don't push it.

45:06.920 --> 45:08.880
Did anyone else think Burke seemed
a bit off?

45:08.880 --> 45:10.520
Did anyone mention it? Morning.

45:10.520 --> 45:12.840
Hadders said that he'd seen him
on 4 deck.

45:12.840 --> 45:14.240
Asked me how he'd seemed.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.280
Who's Hadders? Hadlow.

45:16.280 --> 45:18.160
Officer. My boss.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.600
Don't tell him Adams calls
him Hadders.

45:20.600 --> 45:23.440
But that's the same person
who found the body? Yeah.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.400
Actually, that was the last time
I saw Burke,

45:25.400 --> 45:27.640
if we're being exact about things.

45:27.640 --> 45:30.000
I went in, tried to help out.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.520
Were you nearby?

45:31.520 --> 45:34.040
Yeah, I was sleeping in the next
bunk space along.

45:34.040 --> 45:35.680
I mean, people don't normally shout

45:35.680 --> 45:38.800
when you're on silent routine,
do they? So, when Hadders shouted,

45:38.800 --> 45:40.760
I was like, bang, awake.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.680
First one to get there.

45:42.680 --> 45:44.480
You saw Burke on this deck?

45:44.480 --> 45:47.320
I, er... I was just...
I was just coming through.

45:47.320 --> 45:50.040
I didn't... I didn't stop
or anything.

45:50.040 --> 45:53.720
But afterwards you asked Adams how
Burke had seemed?

45:53.720 --> 45:56.400
Er, no. No, I don't...

45:56.400 --> 45:58.080
I don't think so.

45:58.080 --> 46:00.080
What time did you see him down here?

46:01.440 --> 46:05.480
12.30, maybe. It was about half an
hour before change of watch.

46:05.480 --> 46:07.240
I didn't stop to talk to him.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.800
And I didn't know him that well.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.560
We never sailed together
or anything.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.640
What was he doing? He was
hanging around.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.680
That's what you do when you're
off watch.

46:14.680 --> 46:16.160
People come down here. It's quiet.

46:16.160 --> 46:18.040
And Burke was definitely off watch?

46:18.040 --> 46:21.000
Yes. He wasn't at his station
and he wasn't in uniform.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.640
He was wearing a green fleece.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.280
Where was he standing, exactly?

46:26.280 --> 46:27.840
There.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.200
Can we get the lights turned down
in here?

46:34.680 --> 46:36.120
Do you still need me?

46:36.120 --> 46:37.880
Yeah. Don't go anywhere.

46:37.880 --> 46:39.840
Control room, it's the coxswain.

46:39.840 --> 46:43.160
Could you get the lights dimmed
on deck 3?

46:43.160 --> 46:44.680
Understood, thank you.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.560
They can only give you
a few minutes.

46:51.960 --> 46:54.400
What's that stuff?
It's called luminol.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.560
Forensics use it to show up any
blood stains.

47:02.760 --> 47:04.360
Is that blood?

47:06.400 --> 47:08.800
I, er... I need to get some
scran now.

47:10.280 --> 47:12.520
Did you see anyone else with Burke?

47:12.520 --> 47:14.960
Write these down. I'll get back
to you later...

47:14.960 --> 47:16.360
No, wait.

47:16.360 --> 47:20.840
When you found his body, what did
you see when you entered the cabin?

47:20.840 --> 47:22.440
I found him in his bunk.

47:22.440 --> 47:25.040
Was his curtain drawn back? No.
I drew it back.

47:26.640 --> 47:29.320
But everyone tells me
how precious sleep is down here.

47:29.320 --> 47:31.200
So, weren't you worried about
waking him up?

47:31.200 --> 47:33.040
I guess, I thought, if he was
asleep...

47:33.040 --> 47:34.880
is that something you've
done before?

47:34.880 --> 47:37.920
Gone into someone's cabin and pulled
their curtain? It's not forbidden.

47:37.920 --> 47:39.960
I have a drill to prep
and I haven't eaten yet.

47:39.960 --> 47:41.920
Write down your questions. I'll
get back to you.

47:41.920 --> 47:43.320
No, sorry, we're not done yet.

47:44.600 --> 47:47.920
You were one of the last people to
see him alive. You're the person who

47:47.920 --> 47:51.600
found his body, and yet you can't
tell me why you went to see him?

47:54.880 --> 47:56.880
I've a tight schedule.
It's change of watch.

47:56.880 --> 47:58.280
I've got to go.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.200
Can't you stop him?

48:00.200 --> 48:02.400
He's an officer. Nothing I can do.

48:05.360 --> 48:08.040
I've looked at the trawler's
sound pattern.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.800
It gets pulled down by the nets.

48:11.920 --> 48:13.480
If you listen to this...

48:15.960 --> 48:18.560
That's the floats on the trawl
banging against something.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.960
It's exactly the same signature
as the audio

48:20.960 --> 48:24.200
you would get from the Antares
sinking. I've cross-referenced it.

48:24.200 --> 48:27.600
Sir, with due respect to Petty
Officer Kierly, that noise

48:27.600 --> 48:30.760
could easily just be the nets
snarling on the trawler as it sinks.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.240
No, it's not.

48:32.240 --> 48:34.880
I'm sure. The trawler gets
pulled down by another sub.

48:34.880 --> 48:37.720
It all fits. And can you classify
the other boat?

48:37.720 --> 48:39.840
Not yet. Message CTF.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.320
We need them to identify that boat.

48:41.320 --> 48:43.040
Aye, sir. Sir.

48:43.040 --> 48:46.000
Captain Newsome, may I speak with
you? It's urgent.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.560
Carry on.

48:48.560 --> 48:51.120
I've found blood and I have
a witness who can put Burke

48:51.120 --> 48:52.480
in the same location.

48:52.480 --> 48:54.920
At least one of your crew members
has a history of violence

48:54.920 --> 48:57.840
involving Burke. Look, you can't
ignore this. You've been told to do

48:57.840 --> 49:00.600
your work without interfering...
I appreciate that your mission

49:00.600 --> 49:03.120
takes priority for you,
but there's a line,

49:03.120 --> 49:05.720
and now we need to message
our superiors.

49:05.720 --> 49:08.600
Where was the blood found?
On one of the missile decks.

49:10.280 --> 49:13.200
Did anything unusual happen on
the day that Burke died?

49:13.200 --> 49:15.600
Was there anything different about
his watch? Yeah.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.960
He snorted heroin. There was
certainly heroin powder

49:17.960 --> 49:20.200
found around his nostrils.

49:20.200 --> 49:22.320
Why were you on silent routine?
Write your report.

49:22.320 --> 49:25.360
We'll send it. Sir?
Two transmissions in one week?

49:25.360 --> 49:27.800
Have your report ready to be sent
within the hour.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.640
Have navigation move the boat out of
the patrol area. Aye, sir.

49:30.640 --> 49:32.840
Cronin, prepare to send a message.

49:32.840 --> 49:34.240
Aye, sir. Thank you.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.960
The police officer's arrived.

49:56.960 --> 49:59.040
Should we give her DCI Silva's
report?

49:59.040 --> 50:02.240
No. That doesn't exist until
the Chiefs of Staff say it does.

50:03.680 --> 50:04.880
Fucking Vigil.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.560
There's going to be some serious
changes on there when she gets back.

50:09.560 --> 50:11.000
Yes, sir.

50:23.480 --> 50:26.040
Hello again.
How can I help you?

50:26.040 --> 50:28.200
I need to message my colleague
on Vigil.

50:28.200 --> 50:30.680
Then I'd like to see Craig Burke's
accommodation.

50:42.520 --> 50:44.800
Most of the families live in
Kirkmouth, but the singletons

50:44.800 --> 50:47.080
all want these. It's a walk to work.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.720
Here we are.

50:50.720 --> 50:53.280
I'm afraid you'll need to
wait outside.

50:53.280 --> 50:55.360
Or I can call you, if that's easier?

50:55.360 --> 50:57.160
Is there a reason?

50:57.160 --> 50:59.240
This is a police investigation.

50:59.240 --> 51:01.280
I'm hardly a member of the public.

51:01.280 --> 51:03.040
I know. But still...

51:12.080 --> 51:13.480
Thank you.

51:33.760 --> 51:36.400
Detective Silva.
Message for you from base.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.000
Thank you.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Slow progress here.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.200
Event at sea.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.840
Could be connected to Burke's death?

51:45.840 --> 51:47.360
Same day. Same area.

51:48.600 --> 51:51.480
Remember my dad's job?
Involves one of those.

51:52.640 --> 51:56.320
What happened is the subject
of my dad's favourite song.

51:56.320 --> 51:58.320
We listened to it when I taught
you Morse.

52:03.120 --> 52:06.640
Dash, dot-dot, dash.

52:06.640 --> 52:08.000
Is an N... No, no.

52:09.640 --> 52:12.040
No, an N is dash-dot.

52:13.440 --> 52:16.240
Dash! Dot-dot, dash.

52:18.320 --> 52:20.960
# On New Year's Eve... #

52:20.960 --> 52:24.400
What is that? Mm! I love this song.

52:25.760 --> 52:27.720
It's my dad's favourite song.

52:27.720 --> 52:29.520
He plays it every time
he gets drunk.

52:32.120 --> 52:33.720
He's from Stornoway.

52:33.720 --> 52:37.160
Oh, it was a terrible tragedy,
affected the whole of the island.

52:37.160 --> 52:39.160
The sinking of the Iolaire.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.680
It's still a big
deal for the trawlermen.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.440
Hey. DCI Silva.

52:50.440 --> 52:54.440
You've been ordered to co-operate,
haven't you? Uh... Yes.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.680
Can you tell me about Burke
and the sinking?

52:57.840 --> 52:59.600
I wasn't there.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.240
I was called to replace him after he
got booted.

53:03.320 --> 53:05.000
You replaced him mid-watch?

53:07.080 --> 53:08.960
Yeah.

53:08.960 --> 53:10.600
I need to know why.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.200
In here.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.600
I have to be at a meeting shortly.

53:46.600 --> 53:49.320
How much longer do you need?
I'm done.

53:49.320 --> 53:50.720
Ready to go.

53:50.720 --> 53:52.160
Anything to report?

53:52.160 --> 53:53.480
No.

53:53.480 --> 53:54.960
Nothing yet.

53:54.960 --> 53:56.400
Thank you.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.000
The day Burke died, a trawler sank.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.520
This is a murder enquiry.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.760
You're obliged to be candid with me.
Be quiet.

54:29.120 --> 54:32.120
Don't accuse me of not being...
I've spoken to Hadlow and Adams.

54:32.120 --> 54:34.360
Burke should still have been on
watch at 12.30.

54:34.360 --> 54:36.480
But Hadlow saw him in
casual clothes.

54:36.480 --> 54:39.200
You dismissed him after you hit
a fishing trawler. Why?

54:40.680 --> 54:42.560
Sit down. Please.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.200
WE didn't hit anyone.

54:56.480 --> 54:59.160
As far as we know, another
submarine did.

54:59.160 --> 55:00.840
Someone sitting right behind us.

55:02.720 --> 55:04.640
Do you understand what that means?

55:05.880 --> 55:07.680
Of course you don't.

55:07.680 --> 55:10.760
You're looking for someone who might
have had a punch-up.

55:10.760 --> 55:13.120
We had an enemy submarine
tracking us,

55:13.120 --> 55:15.400
which oughtn't even be possible.

55:18.320 --> 55:22.080
The entire nuclear deterrent rests
on just three things.

55:22.080 --> 55:25.000
The first, you must have
viable weapons.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.600
And second, your enemy can't ever
know if you'll use them.

55:27.600 --> 55:30.320
Which is why we keep
the letter of last resort

55:30.320 --> 55:33.520
in a safe, inside another safe,
on board this boat.

55:33.520 --> 55:37.240
The final thing is, your enemy
mustn't be able to stop you.

55:37.240 --> 55:38.600
So you stay hidden.

55:41.280 --> 55:44.080
If we've been successfully shadowed
by an enemy submarine,

55:44.080 --> 55:47.720
that is the single most
frightening development

55:47.720 --> 55:49.680
in submarine warfare in my lifetime.

55:52.160 --> 55:54.640
Burke wanted us to go on top to
see if there were any survivors

55:54.640 --> 55:56.360
from the trawler.

55:56.360 --> 55:58.320
The mission required we stay hidden.

56:01.480 --> 56:03.560
I made the right decision.

56:03.560 --> 56:05.680
But we're not at war.

56:05.680 --> 56:07.400
That is an illusion.

56:08.920 --> 56:10.880
We have always been at war.

56:26.560 --> 56:29.640
Emergency stations,
emergency stations, all hands.

56:29.640 --> 56:31.960
Emergency stations, all hands.

56:31.960 --> 56:34.200
Reactor scram, reactor scram,

56:34.200 --> 56:37.080
reduce electrical loads
throughout the submarine. Argh!

56:42.760 --> 56:44.640
Emergency stations, all hands.
What's going on?

56:44.640 --> 56:46.880
The reactor has scrammed.
Repeat, the reactor...

56:46.880 --> 56:49.240
What does that mean? Stay there.
This is not a drill.

56:49.240 --> 56:51.080
Reduce electrical loads throughout

56:51.080 --> 56:53.120
the submarine and report to
ship control.

56:55.560 --> 56:57.000
Thank you.

56:58.640 --> 57:01.400
XO, I have the submarine. Take us up
50 metres.

57:01.400 --> 57:03.240
Up 50 metres. Aye, sir.

57:03.240 --> 57:06.880
Where is she? No-one is allowed to
drive unaccompanied on this base!

57:06.880 --> 57:09.680
Get me the EO.
Full report from engineering.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.680
What's happening? Ship control.
Aye, sir!

57:29.560 --> 57:33.080
Off the top of my head, there's 20
different ways you could kill

57:33.080 --> 57:35.120
Vigil's crew single-handed.

57:40.040 --> 57:42.200
But nobody talks about it.

57:42.200 --> 57:43.800
Not the skipper.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.760
The submarine is in trim, sir.
Not the top brass.

57:45.760 --> 57:48.040
They only want silence.
Status control. Close up!

57:50.360 --> 57:51.880
There's corruption.

57:51.880 --> 57:53.040
And fear.

57:54.720 --> 57:58.000
There's men who are being killed,
and the world's still got no idea.

58:00.280 --> 58:03.160
See, we look like a crew, and that's
all that matters to them.

58:04.680 --> 58:06.240
Not what's underneath.

58:07.920 --> 58:10.160
Can you open the gates, please?
Just wait a minute.

58:10.160 --> 58:12.320
I'm Police Scotland. I'm not
interested in waiting.

58:12.320 --> 58:14.120
I'm heading home.
Open the gates, please.

58:14.120 --> 58:16.080
Just wait a minute, please.

58:16.080 --> 58:19.400
I've had some of them come at me.
They'll come at me again.

58:20.800 --> 58:22.120
I know that.

58:24.920 --> 58:27.840
EO, situation report. Captain,
I have no idea what caused it.

58:27.840 --> 58:29.520
It's a complete reactor shutdown.

58:29.520 --> 58:32.760
EO, we need that propulsion to keep
us at depth. Yes, sir. I know.

58:32.760 --> 58:34.640
XO, sitrep.

58:34.640 --> 58:37.360
Reactor scram. No power to the main
engines, sir.

58:37.360 --> 58:38.800
Amy, hold on.

58:44.800 --> 58:48.560
But if they've left me dead,
under two miles of water,

58:48.560 --> 58:50.640
well, here I am.

58:50.640 --> 58:53.040
And I've got things to tell you.
