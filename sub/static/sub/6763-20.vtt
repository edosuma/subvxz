01:58.600 --> 02:01.717
l know that l've been pretending
that the two of you don't exist,

02:01.880 --> 02:05.156
but l've thought it over,
and, well, you are my best friends.

02:05.320 --> 02:08.038
Oh, Brenda, you don't know
how happy l am to hear you say that.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.758
Yeah, me too, Bren.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.309
When the two of you told me about
what happened over the summer,

02:12.480 --> 02:14.516
l thought l'd never
speak to either of you again.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.796
But then l realised
that if l hadn't gone off to Paris,

02:16.960 --> 02:18.109
that nothing would've happened.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.269
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.874
- And it's not like we slept together.
- Absolutely not.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.600
Well, the past is the past
and the future is the future.

02:24.760 --> 02:29.072
And we should all handle this
in a very mature and very rational way.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.233
Oh, my God.
Brenda, what are you doing?

02:31.400 --> 02:34.198
- Where'd she get that?
- l don't know. lt's not my fantasy.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.679
Oh, my--!

02:53.440 --> 02:57.069
You know, if we don't start cleaning,
we're never gonna be done in time.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.434
Kel, we got plenty of time.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.160
My mom's plane doesn't get here
for another three hours.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.198
- Okay, but don't say l didn't warn you.
- Okay.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.515
Wanna go to the airport with me?

03:12.880 --> 03:14.871
No, l don't think
a crowded terminal at LAX

03:15.040 --> 03:16.632
is where l wanna meet your mom.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.756
lt'll be okay.
Just don't give lris any, you know,

03:18.920 --> 03:22.071
hard time about that New Age stuff.
You'll be all right.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.276
Yeah, but if she's really psychic,

03:24.440 --> 03:26.317
don't you think
she'll be able to read my mind?

03:26.480 --> 03:27.799
Right, yeah. Yeah.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.190
She'll just cock one eyebrow
and ask you what your sign is,

03:30.360 --> 03:32.112
and then you know you're in trouble.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.919
Well, l think this is one family reunion
l'm gonna have to be missing,

03:35.080 --> 03:36.752
so let's clean up so l can leave.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.119
Dylan.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.713
Thanks.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.633
Who is that?

04:05.800 --> 04:08.519
Whatever they're selling,
l don't want it.

04:11.680 --> 04:16.231
Dylan, l think you should get that.
Please?

04:25.360 --> 04:26.679
lt's lris.

04:26.840 --> 04:31.311
lris? Oh, my God. Stall her.
l will be right back, okay?

04:37.400 --> 04:39.277
lris, what are you doing here
already?

04:40.320 --> 04:41.833
lt's nice to see you too, Dylan.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.517
You're a little early. About three hours.
l was gonna pick you up at the airport.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.636
l got on the morning plane
and grabbed a cab.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.951
l hope l haven't caught you
at a bad time.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.634
No. No. l just wanted to clean up
a little bit before you got here.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.279
Come on in.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.915
l can see why.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.750
l'm surprised
that Brenda puts up with this mess.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.832
Scorps have a notorious need
for neatness.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.399
Well, Mom, Brenda hasn't actually

05:08.560 --> 05:10.312
been spending a lot of time
around the house.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.233
But then, Brenda
is not your average Scorpio, is she?

05:13.400 --> 05:16.915
After all, she's in love with you.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.193
Hi.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.868
Who's this?

05:22.040 --> 05:24.076
This is Kelly. Kelly Taylor.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.357
Mom, maybe you remember her from
Miss Carney's kindergarten class?

05:27.520 --> 05:30.830
No, l can't say that l do.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.389
- Nice to meet you, Kelly.
- You too.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.552
l think you missed a button or two.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.559
Oh, thanks.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.075
So, Kelly,

05:42.520 --> 05:43.794
what's your sign?

05:48.440 --> 05:51.000
Now, Dave, the only reason
that lcon Records are interested in you

05:51.160 --> 05:53.355
is because of the demo tape
that l sent them.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.158
No, Steve,
the only reason they're interested

05:55.320 --> 05:57.231
is because of the music
that was on the demo tape.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.836
- The music that l had them listen to.
- After l fired you.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.673
Wait, you guys, aren't we forgetting
one really important thing here?

06:03.840 --> 06:06.673
- Well, what would that be, Donna?
- School.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.598
- Anyway, like l was saying, David--
- Hey. No, l mean it.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.354
l'm doing half your radio show so you
can get through your schoolwork

06:13.520 --> 06:16.114
and graduate with us in June.
How can you possibly do a record?

06:16.280 --> 06:18.874
- Donna, please, l'll handle it.
- No, will you let me handle this?

06:19.040 --> 06:21.508
Look, that's what managers are for,
to handle the details.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.079
Steve, that's the reason l fired you,

06:23.240 --> 06:24.832
because you never
took care of the details.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.672
lcon Records is my contact.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.751
You can't cut me out of this.
l deserve to be there.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.194
- Watch me.
- David.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.588
Okay. Okay.
They're gonna eat you alive.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.950
Okay, fine.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.953
l have heard
that Curtis Bray is kind of a shark.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.593
Well,

06:45.880 --> 06:47.791
isn't it lucky for you
that Sanders Management Group

06:47.960 --> 06:49.598
is the ultimate in shark protection?

06:53.560 --> 06:56.438
So, Andrea,
you think l should splurge

06:56.600 --> 06:59.433
for the ten-disc automatic changer
in the trunk?

06:59.600 --> 07:01.989
Oh, l don't know.
Looks pretty expensive to me.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.912
But then, everything's expensive,
isn't it?

07:04.080 --> 07:06.150
What's the matter?
Are we feeling particularly broke?

07:06.320 --> 07:08.629
Not broke, poor.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.233
l don't know.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.958
l was invited to this tea
in Los Angeles

07:12.120 --> 07:14.918
for everyone who was accepted
to Yale's early admissions.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.992
- Oh, a tea. How civilised.
- Yeah.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.354
Well, it's in San Marino,

07:19.520 --> 07:22.193
which is about as old as money gets
in Los Angeles.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.238
l mean, everybody will have travelled
everywhere and seen everything.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.119
- What am l supposed to say to them?
- ''Hello'' usually works for me.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.160
Brandon, l'm serious.

07:31.360 --> 07:35.319
Look, l'm just a nice Jewish girl
from <i>V</i> an Nuys.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.869
l don't know.
Maybe l don't belong at Yale.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.109
Of course you belong at Yale.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.679
You got accepted
because you're smart.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.195
That's the only thing that matters.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.192
You're not having second thoughts,
are you?

07:47.640 --> 07:50.837
All l can say
is be careful for what you wish.

07:55.920 --> 07:59.469
- Donna. l'm glad you're still here.
- Why? What's the matter?

07:59.640 --> 08:01.949
l just met Dylan's mom.
Can we sit over here?

08:02.120 --> 08:04.395
l'm not in the mood
to deal with the crowd.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.319
So tell me, how'd it go?

08:07.480 --> 08:09.391
ls lris as weird
as Dylan makes her out to be?

08:09.560 --> 08:10.754
Weird? l don't know.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.708
She was more like judgemental
and a little bitchy.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.115
So, Kel, what'll it be?

08:16.560 --> 08:19.438
Oh, nothing. l'm not very hungry.
Maybe just some tea.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.033
Sure. You feeling okay?

08:21.560 --> 08:23.915
l was, until l met lris McKay.

08:24.760 --> 08:25.988
The eagle has landed.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.558
And all she wanted to talk about
was her good friend Brenda.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.756
With you there?
lsn't that a little rude?

08:31.920 --> 08:33.318
Yeah.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.517
lt seems they have a special bond.
She even brought her a present.

08:36.679 --> 08:39.274
Hey, don't look at me.
l can't figure lris out either.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.749
l'm not worried about lris.
She leaves in a couple of days.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.275
But Bren's another story.
She still isn't talking to me.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.829
Kel, don't put me
in the middle of this one, okay?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.719
Sorry. How's she doing?

08:49.880 --> 08:52.110
Well, you know Bren,
she always lands on her feet.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.391
- Hey, Bren, you okay?
- Brandon, you don't have to talk softly.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.359
Some people were asking about you
at the Peach Pit tonight.

09:06.520 --> 09:10.229
- Which people?
- Donna, David, Andrea, Steve.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.958
Kelly.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.430
Tell Donna, David, Andrea
and Steve, hi.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.837
You know, Bren,
this is a little weird for everyone.

09:19.240 --> 09:23.028
Like tonight, Kelly told me
lris was asking about you.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.635
Do you wanna know that
or do you not want to?

09:25.800 --> 09:28.439
l mean,
should l just keep my mouth shut?

09:30.400 --> 09:31.913
lris is in town?

09:32.080 --> 09:35.436
Yeah, she came to talk to Dad
about Dylan's trust fund.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.156
Didn't he tell you?

09:38.560 --> 09:40.915
Dad must think l'm really losing it.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.994
- Aren't you?
- Thanks.

09:45.720 --> 09:49.838
Bren, if you want me to butt out,
just say so, but...

09:51.000 --> 09:52.558
Brandon,
can l tell you something awful?

09:52.720 --> 09:55.314
But you've gotta swear
not to tell anybody.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.717
l know making Dylan choose
between me and Kelly

10:00.880 --> 10:02.393
seemed like a bizarre thing to do.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.271
But l never thought it was a contest.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.912
l never thought that l would lose.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.078
Bren, are you okay?

10:13.720 --> 10:16.314
l would be better if everybody
stopped asking me if l was okay.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.873
All right.

10:21.560 --> 10:22.834
Now, you're sure you're okay?

10:26.840 --> 10:29.559
- Good night, Bren.
- Good night, Mom.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.715
l thought
you were saving up for skis.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.075
Dad, the ski season
started months ago without me.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.595
l'm thinking more
consumer electronics now.

10:41.760 --> 10:42.749
Oh, what are you getting?

10:42.920 --> 10:45.070
l'm gonna get a CD system
for the Stang.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.754
- Can you afford that?
- Yeah, they aren't that much.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.309
You can get everything you need
for about 450 bucks.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.758
l didn't know
you were that prosperous.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.478
Well, l've been working a long time,
Dad.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.870
l guess it's finally starting to add up.

10:58.360 --> 10:59.634
Well, your father's just jealous,

10:59.800 --> 11:01.358
because he's been working
a long time too,

11:01.520 --> 11:03.556
but he doesn't have a CD player
in his car.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.598
- Hi, honey.
- Morning, Bren.

11:12.440 --> 11:13.429
You know, yesterday,

11:13.600 --> 11:16.717
you guys were asking me how l was
every two seconds.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.838
Now, today, you're ignoring me.
l really don't know which is worse.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.151
- Honey, we're trying.
- How about try normal?

11:23.320 --> 11:25.311
Just plain old normal, like:

11:25.480 --> 11:28.153
''What do you want for breakfast?
What are you doing today?''

11:29.440 --> 11:32.273
And, Dad, l know about your meeting
with lris McKay.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.113
You don't have to walk on eggshells
around me.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.113
l'm sorry.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.077
l just was trying
to keep you out of this.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.198
l know my involvement with Dylan's
trust makes things hard on you.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.318
Last week,
you made a big point of telling me

11:48.480 --> 11:50.675
how your business is confidential,
right?

11:51.160 --> 11:53.549
- Right.
- Keep it that way. We'll all be happy.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.796
l'm glad you decided to fly in
this weekend, lris.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.111
lt gives Jack a very clear message
who's in control here.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.750
My ex-husband's a very shrewd man.
Don't ever underestimate him, Jim.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.831
Believe me, l don't.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.275
That's why we're gonna draught
a letter restating your position,

12:13.440 --> 12:14.919
and that will be that.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.389
l've never been very good
at standing up to him.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.949
While he was behind bars,
l thought we'd all be safe for a while,

12:20.120 --> 12:23.430
but leave it to Jack
to find a way to get out early.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.551
His release
caught a lot of people off-guard.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.995
Can't Dylan see
he's just being conned?

12:30.040 --> 12:32.270
Dylan says that Jack's a new man.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.716
The only thing new about Jack

12:34.880 --> 12:37.235
is that he's never
preyed on his own son before.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.795
He's a salesman, Jim.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.350
He tells people what they wanna hear,
and they buy into it.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.592
And what Dylan wants to hear
is that he has a father.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.595
All you have to do is say no, lris.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.910
He can't touch Dylan's money
without your approval.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.317
When you were little, you'd like to
watch me shave. You remember that?

12:58.480 --> 12:59.515
Yeah.

12:59.680 --> 13:03.468
l also remember cutting myself
a couple times on that razor.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.079
You know, Dylan,

13:08.240 --> 13:10.470
you're gonna hear things
from your mom.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.392
Already have.

13:12.560 --> 13:13.549
Well, the truth is,

13:13.720 --> 13:16.439
if she's talking about the past,
most of it is probably true.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.076
She's convinced
you're gonna try to rip me off.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.319
You think l'm gonna rip you off?

13:22.720 --> 13:24.995
- l don't know.
- Why are you going along with this?

13:25.160 --> 13:27.276
Because l wanna believe you.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.396
l mean, you made the money
in the first place.

13:29.560 --> 13:33.075
You gave it to lris.
She gave it to me. l just--

13:33.240 --> 13:34.309
l wanna give something back.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.478
Thanks, kid.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.835
You know,
l'm glad that money's yours.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.716
Hell, if it were still in my name,
you and l both know it'd be gone.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.110
You know, maybe this way
we can both have a future.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.236
- And so can your mom.
- You mean that?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.789
When l gave lris that money,
l didn't give a damn what she did.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.518
l just wanted her out
of my sightline.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.477
She could've gone
on a hell of a shopping spree,

14:00.640 --> 14:02.153
but she didn't.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.515
She saved that money
for her only child.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.159
Quite a woman, your mother.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.639
Yeah.

14:08.600 --> 14:11.319
ln fact, we'd probably still be together
if she weren't such a kook.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.913
Yeah.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.072
You know, Dylan,

14:17.240 --> 14:19.515
you don't read the financial papers,
but l do.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.075
This recession's
got everybody on the run,

14:22.240 --> 14:24.834
which is the exact time
to move fo <i>rw</i> ard.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.389
These bargains
are not gonna be around forever.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.358
Sounds good to me.
l don't think lris is interested.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.035
There's gotta be something more
in her life that she wants

14:33.200 --> 14:35.156
than just sitting around a tree house
and meditating.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.108
l don't know.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.713
Why don't you spend
some time with her?

14:38.880 --> 14:41.235
Why don't you drive her up
to that town she's crazy about?

14:41.400 --> 14:44.119
Oh, Jack, come on, l hate Ojai.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.191
Come on, Dylan.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.954
We gotta make it easy
for lris to say yes.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.439
She wouldn't have come
to California

14:50.600 --> 14:52.431
if a part of her didn't wanna
open up that trust.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.629
Now, come on,

14:54.800 --> 14:56.916
you know,
just hang out with her a little bit.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.435
Find out what drummer
she's marching to,

14:59.600 --> 15:01.238
and l'll just take care of it from there.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.836
Trust me.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.750
l didn't hear you come in last night.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.753
Yeah, l stayed out pretty late. Sorry.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.990
With Jack or with Kelly?

15:35.160 --> 15:37.720
First one then the other.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.154
Here's to honesty.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.398
You know, lris,
if we sit around here all day

15:42.560 --> 15:44.471
we're just gonna get
on each other's nerves.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.312
You know that.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.195
So why don't we just

15:49.720 --> 15:51.597
get in the car,
take a drive up to Ojai?

15:52.120 --> 15:55.430
- You like Ojai?
- No, but l like to drive.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.433
Okay, let me just get my bag.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.359
Whatever doesn't kill me
makes me stronger.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.237
You know, last time l was here
you were getting in fights in pool halls.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.358
Now you're suggesting mellow days
in the country. What happened?

16:12.520 --> 16:13.555
lf that's too tame for you,

16:13.720 --> 16:15.392
we can always go down
to Sunset Boulevard,

16:15.560 --> 16:17.790
you know, insult a couple bikers.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.360
You seem happy, Dylan. Centered.

16:22.520 --> 16:26.718
Well, a lot of things have fallen
into place for me.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.235
- Kelly?
- Yeah, she's part of it.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.960
And the feds deciding that l don't
have to spend the next ten years

16:32.120 --> 16:33.758
wondering what it'd be like
to have a father.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.554
l'd like the three of us to sit down.
You, me, Jack.

16:38.720 --> 16:39.789
We'll see.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.712
Come on, Mom.
What'd you come all this way for?

16:41.880 --> 16:43.279
You know, you gotta
see him sometime.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.431
Let's just-- We'll have dinner,

16:45.600 --> 16:47.830
and you two can get
to know each other all over again.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.150
l know all l wanna know
about your father.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.914
Talk to him. lt'd mean a lot to me.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.877
You're as bad as he is,
you know that?

16:57.240 --> 16:59.674
Good.
So we'll spend the day in Ojai.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.513
And tonight
we'll have dinner with Jack, okay?

17:05.079 --> 17:06.911
Okay.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.757
Wow, look at all these awards.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.717
These aren't swimming trophies,
Donna.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.438
May l help you?

17:15.599 --> 17:16.919
Paulette.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.356
- l'm Steve Sanders.
- Then you must be David.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.272
- You have a very persistent manager.
- Thank you.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.589
This won't take long, will it?

17:25.680 --> 17:27.715
l'll let Mr. Bray know
that you're here.

17:28.119 --> 17:29.519
Thank you.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.110
l don't understand why
this couldn't wait until Monday.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.033
David, the music business
is a Sundays, holidays,

17:39.200 --> 17:41.430
3:00-in-the-morning kind of deal.
You better get used to it.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.955
Do you know who records
for these guys? The Painkillers.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.634
- Who are they?
- lt's trance-dance synth pop.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.597
Their debut album went gold
in two days.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.193
That's gonna be you next year,
big guy.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.874
l can see the headlines in Billboard
right now. ''Silver Goes Gold.''

17:53.040 --> 17:54.029
Steve, keep it down, okay?

17:54.200 --> 17:56.270
l don't wanna blow this
before we even get in the door.

17:56.440 --> 17:57.714
Mr. Bray said that he'll see you,

17:58.960 --> 17:59.949
as soon as he can.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.239
Excuse me.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.432
You look so familiar.
Now, how do l know you?

18:25.600 --> 18:28.717
l don't know.
Maybe the academic decathlon

18:28.880 --> 18:31.599
or the inter-district leadership
conference.

18:31.760 --> 18:35.116
Tahoe. lsn't it Zuckerman?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.793
Of course, you ski
at Alpine Meadows.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.713
Your family has that big place out
by the north shore, by the Holloways.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.155
The only place my family has
is in <i>V</i> an Nuys.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.599
That is so funny.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.716
A place in <i>V</i> an Nuys.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.199
Tedro, you've gotta hear this.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.119
Andrea?

18:59.120 --> 19:01.554
Remember me?
Jordan Bonner from Shaw.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.390
- Sure, l do. How are you?
- Good, how are you?

19:05.560 --> 19:08.120
- l can't believe you're going to Yale.
- Don't be so shocked.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.396
l'm not shocked.
Are you kidding? l'm relieved.

19:10.560 --> 19:11.675
Finally, a familiar face.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.593
So, what made you pick Yale?

19:17.080 --> 19:18.513
They picked me.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.591
l think they're looking
for another Clarence Thomas.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.353
Boy, will they be surprised.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.639
Can you tell me something?
ls it me or are these people--?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.233
Yes.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.598
Thank you.
l'm so glad you said that.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.478
l was starting to feel like it was me.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.675
l know one thing for sure.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.149
l am definitely the only one here
on scholarship.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.992
You think so, huh?

19:40.600 --> 19:41.953
No?

19:53.520 --> 19:56.398
You are a vision. You two, a vision.

19:58.880 --> 20:02.077
Earring, David. Thank God
you have that unique look.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.317
All of my acts have that unique look.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.320
Steven, well, you know...

20:07.480 --> 20:10.074
- Sit down. Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.198
Gentlemen,
l think we can skip the gavotte.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.035
l cheated. l admit it, so sue me.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.997
l ran your tape past Serge Menkin.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.835
- The producer?
- ls Serge Menkin a producer?

20:27.000 --> 20:30.276
Well, for a while there, he wasn't.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.237
He thinks you're his comeback.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.719
Wait a second.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.757
You mean Serge wants
to produce my record?

20:35.920 --> 20:37.717
Didn't l just say that?

20:37.880 --> 20:40.110
l mean, frankly, he needs us
more than we need him.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.474
Now, that's a relationship.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.993
Doesn't this guy
have a drug problem?

20:43.520 --> 20:45.272
ln this business, who hasn't?

20:45.440 --> 20:47.954
l mean, l haven't. You haven't.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.793
- Please tell me you haven't.
- No, l haven't.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.078
Good. No drugs.
No songs about drugs.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.798
No songs about killing cops.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.871
ldeally, no songs
about killing anyone.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.837
Well, certainly,
there's a lot of considerations.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.039
l have to get this.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.789
All right.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.712
Sorry, l have to grab this.

21:10.320 --> 21:14.518
Sorry? What am l apologising for?
l'm gonna make you a star.

21:14.680 --> 21:18.514
Paulette says that your friend Donna
is a big Painkillers fan.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.352
- Yeah, so am l.
- Beautiful, beautiful.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.511
Then, Steve, do me a favour,
won't you?

21:22.680 --> 21:26.355
Take Donna down the hall,
load up on CDs, on me.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.953
Did l say, ''on me''?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.395
See, already, you have me wrapped
around your little finger.

21:30.560 --> 21:31.754
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

21:31.920 --> 21:35.037
Paulette, show Mr. Sanders
the CDs. Yes.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.553
Thank you.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.631
David, lose the yutz.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.315
What do you mean?

21:41.480 --> 21:44.756
What do you mean, what do l mean?
Lose the yutz.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.674
Oh, you mean Steve?

21:46.840 --> 21:48.273
You got other yutzes?

21:48.440 --> 21:51.637
Look, David, l like dealing
with young entertainers.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.588
But a high-school Danny Rose?
No, this l don't need.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.718
- Well, l don't think--
- Don't think. Do.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.233
Get rid of Sanders, or no deal.

22:02.400 --> 22:06.678
Well, l'm glad we had this little chat,
huh?

22:07.480 --> 22:09.550
l mean, what are we if not honest
with each other, huh?

22:11.200 --> 22:13.077
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

22:13.640 --> 22:14.629
Yes.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.395
l hope we're not signing up

22:17.560 --> 22:20.597
for four years of cucumber sandwiches
with the crusts cut off.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.069
Don't worry, l hear New Haven
has the best pizza in the world.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.673
l'll be serving it up.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.195
- You're gonna get a job?
- Are you kidding?

22:27.360 --> 22:29.715
A job. A loan. Whatever it takes.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.678
They gave me a partial scholarship,
but the other half costs a fortune.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.353
My parents tell me
not to worry about it,

22:34.520 --> 22:35.794
but l can't help feel guilty.

22:35.960 --> 22:37.154
What are you gonna do?

22:37.320 --> 22:39.311
l'm getting a full ride.

22:39.920 --> 22:40.909
No.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.310
l couldn't have swung it
any other way.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.236
You are so lucky. l can't believe it.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.913
Now you're making me feel guilty.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.718
l'm sorry.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.671
Till New Haven, Zuckerman.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.195
l know her from Tahoe.
She's very droll.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.991
l thought
you didn't know anybody here.

22:59.160 --> 23:02.755
l don't, but who am l
to blow against the wind?

23:12.760 --> 23:13.795
Brenda, you have a visitor.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.914
- Who?
- lt's Kelly, honey.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.389
She wants to see you.
l think you should talk to her.

23:19.560 --> 23:20.959
All right, Mom. l guess you're right.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.509
l'm gonna have to
get it over with eventually.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.515
l don't know quite
how this all happened.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.432
l thought if anybody knew,
it would be you.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.040
Bren, things just flew out of control,
you know?

23:38.200 --> 23:40.760
l think back now, and there's so much
l'd like to do differently.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.114
Yeah, like everything.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.432
Only everything
that has to do with Dylan.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.238
Well, that's everything.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.913
We were friends before Dylan.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.833
And if we're not friends after Dylan,
then it's just not worth it to me.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.831
- Do you mean that?
- Yeah.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.594
You don't know how much it hurts me
to see you suffering like this.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.710
- Kelly, what's in your hair?
- What?

24:01.880 --> 24:03.108
There's something in your hair.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.428
- Where?
- lt's right here.

24:08.600 --> 24:09.919
l'll help you out with it.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.798
Brenda, what are you doing?

24:11.960 --> 24:13.757
Why? Do you think
l'd hurt my best friend?

24:13.920 --> 24:17.071
Oh, my Go-- Mrs. Walsh, help me!

24:17.240 --> 24:19.151
Help yourself, Kelly.
You did with Dylan.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.319
So, Jack, how does it feel
to be out and about again?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.152
l get down on my knees
and thank God

24:43.320 --> 24:44.799
for giving me a second chance.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.309
Sure, you do.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.235
Oh, l swear, lris.
Over here by the window,

24:49.400 --> 24:51.630
you'll find two dents in the carpet
to match these knees.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.918
You're still doing gin and tonic?

24:54.080 --> 24:56.435
l gave that up a long time ago.
Just a mineral water, please.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.712
Okay.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.153
So how was Ojai?

25:02.320 --> 25:03.548
Walk on any hot coals?

25:03.920 --> 25:06.832
- Bend any metal with your minds?
- Funny.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.515
We visited a school.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.797
A school, huh?

25:10.960 --> 25:11.949
What kind of school?

25:12.600 --> 25:15.114
Just a small alternative school.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.191
lt's a place where spirituality

25:17.360 --> 25:19.828
is as much a part of the curriculum
as academics.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.228
Well, l went to one like that.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.755
Only mine had nuns that whopped you
on the hand with a ruler

25:23.920 --> 25:25.035
if you got out of line.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.794
lris is thinking about starting
a similar school in Hawaii.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.188
Really?

25:29.480 --> 25:32.278
School?
Well, that sounds ambitious.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.000
lt's only a pipe dream.
l don't have that kind of money.

25:35.160 --> 25:39.153
- Dylan does.
- Mom, just say the word, it's all yours.

25:40.640 --> 25:44.918
- You're in on this too?
- What? Did l say something wrong?

25:45.360 --> 25:47.476
You've done a real good job, Jack.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.949
You've trained your son very well.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.592
To think
that l was actually naive enough

25:52.760 --> 25:55.558
to think that Dylan wanted
to spend the day with me.

25:57.720 --> 26:00.109
- Get my coat please. We're leaving.
- Wait a minute. Time out.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.317
You bought me off once, Jack.
l am not falling for it again.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.480
- That's not what's going on here.
- Let me tell you something.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.471
l didn't sacrifice
to save that money for you

26:08.640 --> 26:09.914
just so he'd get his hands on it.

26:10.080 --> 26:13.516
lris, l agree. lt was wrong to keep you
away from your son all those years,

26:13.680 --> 26:16.114
but don't try to control him now
just to get even with me.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.510
Don't talk to me about control.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.949
Oh, come on, lris.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.270
Why can't we just start all over again,
for Dylan's sake?

26:22.440 --> 26:25.716
- Oh, please. That's a joke.
- Mom...

26:25.880 --> 26:28.633
Dylan, l am leaving.
You can do what you want.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.519
Dylan always does what he wants,
haven't you figured that out by now?

26:31.680 --> 26:33.750
l can't tell him what to do
any more than you can.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.434
No. You're just his father.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.630
The only father in America
who's in it for the money.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.798
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for school?

27:02.960 --> 27:03.949
l am ready for school.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.998
Okay. Can l give you a ride?

27:07.680 --> 27:09.033
Thanks, l'll be down in a minute.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.229
Hang in there, champ.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.678
Dad...

27:14.680 --> 27:16.432
l can't do it.

27:17.080 --> 27:20.516
l'm trying so hard to be mature
and not hate them,

27:20.680 --> 27:21.908
and it's like l'm drowning,

27:22.080 --> 27:23.957
and l can't breathe,
and l don't know what to do.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.031
Brenda.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.750
Daddy, help me, please.

27:29.560 --> 27:33.030
lt just goes over and over again
in my head, and l can't make it stop.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.156
Oh, sweetheart.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.675
He dumped me, Dad,
for my best friend.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.434
Why?
What did l do to deserve this?

27:52.520 --> 27:55.193
lsn't it time you were leaving
for school?

27:55.720 --> 27:59.315
lris, l've been very capable of getting
myself to school for some time now,

27:59.480 --> 28:00.913
so l'd appreciate it greatly

28:01.080 --> 28:02.832
if you'd just drop
the parental-guidance act.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.228
You don't seem to have a problem

28:04.400 --> 28:06.356
with your father's
parental-guidance act though.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.351
No, l don't.

28:08.560 --> 28:12.678
You know, for the life of me,
l can't figure out why you believe him.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.034
Because l've spent more time
with him

28:14.200 --> 28:16.270
since he's been behind bars
than l ever did growing up.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.874
You know what, lris? l like him.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.792
That is absolutely frightening.

28:21.480 --> 28:23.311
All my life,
people turned their backs on me.

28:23.480 --> 28:26.552
l know what it feels like.
l won't do it to him.

28:30.040 --> 28:33.430
You know, the two of you
deserve each other.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.276
So does that mean
you're gonna sign?

28:36.440 --> 28:39.591
No, that means
you're going to school.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.636
Well, Curtis Bray
is a definite madman,

28:46.800 --> 28:49.234
but l've been checking him out
and l think we should go with him.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.755
- So do l.
- lcon Records is the place for hip-hop.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.514
Which is why l've been pushing
you there so hard in the first place.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.591
l think they may wanna make
some changes.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.193
l'm sure they know
what they're doing.

28:58.360 --> 29:01.909
No. Steve, l mean major changes.
He was telling me after you left.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.233
David, your work is terrific
just the way it is.

29:05.400 --> 29:08.392
l'm here to protect you
and your music.

29:08.560 --> 29:10.835
- Steve--
- David, you're the man.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.708
You're the one with the talent.
You're the one with the voice.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.917
And as far as l'm concerned,
you're the one that's calling the shots.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.792
Talk to you later.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.630
Oh, thank you for showing up
on time.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.711
l couldn't do it, Donna.
l couldn't tell him.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.632
Tell who what?

29:36.600 --> 29:39.797
Well, we met with lcon Records,
and they wanna sign me,

29:39.960 --> 29:41.598
but l have to get rid of Steve first.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.998
And you're still talking to them?

29:44.160 --> 29:45.798
See, that's exactly what l said.

29:45.960 --> 29:47.632
What do you wanna do
when you grow up?

29:47.800 --> 29:48.835
l have no idea.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.592
Well, l do.
l know exactly what l wanna do.

29:50.760 --> 29:52.751
And Curtis Bray can get me there.

29:53.760 --> 29:57.275
Come on, Donna, he's broken seven
major hip-hop groups in the past year.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.432
Why don't you find out how many
he's stabbed in the back?

30:03.800 --> 30:06.189
All l can say is, you better level
with Steve from the beginning,

30:06.360 --> 30:08.078
because the longer you wait
to tell the truth,

30:08.240 --> 30:09.514
the worse it gets for everyone.

30:15.120 --> 30:18.032
- Hey, Andrea, how was your Yale tea?
- lnteresting.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.839
lnteresting? Like how?
What were the kids like?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.194
Well, l wouldn't call them kids.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.112
l'd call them junior captains
of industry.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.475
They spent the whole time
name-dropping and networking.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.868
There l was, trying to figure out

30:28.040 --> 30:30.395
how to hold a purse and a teacup
at the same time.

30:30.560 --> 30:35.554
There was a kid by the name
of Ezra Stiles the 1 7th or something,

30:35.720 --> 30:37.711
that had a whole building named
after him.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.916
Well, maybe they'll name
a building after you someday.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.359
l doubt it.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.593
Anyway, l did bump into
a friend of yours there.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.111
- Really, who's that?
- Jordan Bonner.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.594
Jordan Bonner's going to Yale?

30:52.760 --> 30:55.479
And they're giving him a free ride.
The whole enchilada.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.438
- Right down to his shaving cream.
- Well, way to go, Jordan.

30:59.200 --> 31:02.351
He's a nice guy.
We had a great time.

31:02.520 --> 31:05.671
l think that tea would've been
a total disaster without him.

31:07.720 --> 31:09.517
Well,
it appears the feeling is mutual.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.829
He just sent you a fax.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.956
He did not. Let me see that.

31:13.120 --> 31:16.237
lt says, ''To my favourite Yalie.

31:16.400 --> 31:19.836
Boola boola.
Your friend, Jordan Bonner.''

31:21.360 --> 31:23.157
Boola boola.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.390
Crazy guy.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.068
So how was your day
with your mom?

31:27.240 --> 31:30.277
Well, l thought l'd have a chance
to get through to her, but l didn't.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.556
- What now?
- She goes back to Hawaii.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.358
My father and l
wait till my 21 st birthday

31:34.520 --> 31:37.592
before we can take
the financial world by storm.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.393
- l'm sorry.
- lt's okay.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.391
- See you at lunch.
- Okay.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.833
Brenda...

31:51.480 --> 31:52.959
Brenda...

31:53.360 --> 31:55.715
Please don't shut me out like this.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.271
Kelly, you have Dylan now.
What more do you want?

32:09.800 --> 32:11.119
- l'll get it.
- That's lris McKay.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.032
Turn off the television, will you?

32:13.600 --> 32:15.079
Well, can l watch the game
in your room?

32:15.240 --> 32:16.673
Brandon, this obsession
with basketball

32:16.840 --> 32:18.034
is getting a little out of hand.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.430
Dad, l am not obsessed. l'm not.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.989
- We need to talk.
- Fine, after the game.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.515
Oh, lris, it's just so good to see you.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.989
l wouldn't have come to town
without seeing you.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.718
- Hi, lris.
- Brandon.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.440
lt's great to see you.
Will you excuse me?

32:32.600 --> 32:34.192
l think he has homework to do.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.954
ls Brenda here?
l was hoping to see her too.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.509
Well, you know,
she's not feeling very well.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.111
l'll just stick my head in.
l brought her something.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.069
Go on up. l'm sure it'll be fine.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.236
l'll be right down.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.317
Fine? Brenda'll be furious.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.477
l don't think so.

32:59.960 --> 33:03.316
Crystals provide a shield
from negative energy.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.716
What are you supposed
to do with it?

33:05.880 --> 33:07.108
Just hold it close.

33:07.280 --> 33:08.872
Wear it around your neck if you like.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.758
Let it help to make you strong.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.753
l'll try anything right about now.

33:13.680 --> 33:15.318
Like everything else, Brenda,

33:15.480 --> 33:18.631
even despair
eventually exhausts itself.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.912
Well, it's exhausting me.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.116
Your relationship with Dylan
isn't over.

33:24.280 --> 33:28.432
This is just one moment
in a very long lifetime.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.678
l'm not sure what Dylan told you,
but it is definitely over.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.877
All that's left now
is headed right for the trash.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.112
Close your eyes.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.269
What?

33:40.440 --> 33:42.715
Close your eyes,
and get a mental picture

33:42.880 --> 33:46.031
of the happiest time
you and Dylan had together.

33:46.520 --> 33:49.671
ls this some kind
of New Age visualisation thing?

33:49.840 --> 33:51.478
Just do it.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.953
Can you see it?

33:58.600 --> 34:00.591
ls there something in that box
from that time?

34:04.320 --> 34:06.709
Your relationship with Dylan
is far deeper

34:06.880 --> 34:08.472
than a box full of memories.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.714
You stood by him
when no one else did.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.199
Great.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.149
So he thanks me by falling in love
with my best friend.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.436
A wise man once said:

34:19.600 --> 34:23.353
''Salvation is attained
by being so clear-headed

34:23.520 --> 34:25.078
and inwardly strong,

34:25.520 --> 34:27.954
you can meet your opponent
halfway.''

34:29.880 --> 34:32.440
l can't ever imagine being
that clear-headed or that strong.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.397
You already are.

34:35.360 --> 34:38.351
- Well, l do feel a little better.
- Good.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.716
- Must be the crystal.
- Maybe.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.556
Then again, maybe it's you.

34:57.080 --> 35:01.995
So David's gonna be a big rock star.
Who would've thought?

35:02.160 --> 35:04.674
- l did.
- Yeah, you did, didn't you?

35:05.120 --> 35:07.839
Nat, everybody admires
a final product,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.353
but who appreciates the grunt work

35:09.520 --> 35:12.034
that went into making him
what he is today?

35:12.320 --> 35:13.719
Well, l can say l knew him when.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.348
Hey, David, how about
an autographed 8-by-1 0

35:16.520 --> 35:18.476
for the Peach Pit ''Galaxy of Stars''?

35:19.040 --> 35:21.679
- Sure, Nat.
- Okay.

35:21.960 --> 35:22.949
What's up, Steve?

35:23.120 --> 35:24.758
What's going on?
Why the late-night meeting?

35:24.920 --> 35:28.276
Although, l'm always at your disposal.
What's the problem?

35:28.880 --> 35:31.474
l've been trying to tell you all day.
Bray wants to make some changes.

35:31.640 --> 35:32.755
Big changes.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.751
Are you still worried about that?

35:34.920 --> 35:37.070
Dave, l told you,
your music is the ticket.

35:37.240 --> 35:41.074
Steve, it's not the music.
lt's the personnel.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.595
He said, either you go, or no deal.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.239
Well,

35:46.680 --> 35:50.355
at least we found out sooner than later
that he's a sleaze-ball.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.909
lt's a little setback, but it's okay.
We'll find somebody else.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.195
Steve, l'm gonna tell him yes.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.311
You're gonna tell him what?

35:58.200 --> 35:59.428
l hooked you up with this guy.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.079
- l don't have any choice.
- You do.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.958
What good is it gonna do
if l get nowhere?

36:03.120 --> 36:04.712
l was shelling out bribes
at the Beach Club

36:04.880 --> 36:07.235
just so you'd get your first gig,
that's when you were nowhere.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.038
Listen, Steve,
if this things goes anywhere,

36:09.200 --> 36:10.758
you know l'll come back for you.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.831
- Don't do me any favours.
- Listen, man, l'm sorry.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.956
l just gotta do what's right for me.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.310
You know, l've done some
pretty pathetic things in my life,

36:20.760 --> 36:23.638
but this... This...

36:23.800 --> 36:26.360
At least l know now
that l'm not the lowest of the low.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.157
Sure you don't want me
to take you to the airport?

36:39.320 --> 36:40.389
No, you go to school.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.596
l have to drop by
Jim Walsh's office first, anyway,

36:42.760 --> 36:44.796
- to sign some papers.
- What?

36:47.120 --> 36:48.599
You're getting what you want, Dylan.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.950
Why? What made you
change your mind?

36:52.360 --> 36:54.794
l did one thing
that l'm proud of as a mother.

36:54.960 --> 36:57.758
One great, unselfish thing.

36:57.920 --> 37:00.388
- l set up that trust for you.
- l know.

37:00.560 --> 37:03.757
l mean, l don't always act like it,
but l know.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.837
Sometimes it's wiser

37:08.600 --> 37:10.830
to meet your opponent halfway.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.155
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi.

37:39.320 --> 37:40.912
Does this mean
you're talking to me again?

37:41.440 --> 37:43.510
- l guess so.
- Well, l'm glad.

37:44.440 --> 37:47.637
- See you.
- Yeah.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.436
l have to admit, l'm--

37:55.960 --> 37:59.509
Well, l'm surprised
you've come to this decision.

37:59.680 --> 38:02.353
- But if you think it's best--
- lt's for Dylan.

38:03.480 --> 38:06.040
Well, it's your decision.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.952
Jim, what am l trying to hold onto?

38:08.760 --> 38:12.309
Not my son.
lf anything, l'm driving him away.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.473
And if all l'm holding onto
is my contempt for Jack,

38:16.640 --> 38:19.234
well, maybe it's time
l gave that up too.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.035
l just want my son to be happy.

38:22.720 --> 38:23.755
l know you do.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.480
And if the worst does happen
with Dylan's trust,

38:26.640 --> 38:29.438
well, l never believed that money
could buy happiness anyway.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.791
- What have you got there?
- Mementos of my life with Dylan.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.110
You'd think it'd fit into
more than one box.

38:42.280 --> 38:43.633
What are you gonna do with it?

38:43.800 --> 38:46.712
Well, l was going to dump it
in the trash, but l changed my mind.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.472
l'm gonna put it in the garage
instead.

38:48.640 --> 38:49.789
Good for you.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.633
But, Mom, just do me a favour.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.631
lf l ever get the sudden urge
to go out there

38:54.800 --> 38:56.756
and start mooning over this stuff,
just burn it.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.592
You got a deal.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.311
What on earth is that?

39:11.160 --> 39:13.037
Brandon!

39:14.280 --> 39:16.510
Brandon, isn't that too loud?

39:16.680 --> 39:18.113
Mom, it's all about the subwoofer.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.748
You don't just hear it. You feel it.
Get in. Try it. lt's killer.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.115
Oh, l don't know.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.749
How good is that?

39:24.920 --> 39:26.478
Honey, just turn it down a little bit.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.029
- l'm feeling it too much.
- Fine.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.275
Brandon, new skis, new stereo?

39:32.440 --> 39:34.670
Did a rich uncle l don't know about,
like, croak or something?

39:34.840 --> 39:35.829
Brenda...

39:36.000 --> 39:37.479
Mom, this stuff is very expensive.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.916
What good is money if you can't
spend it on the people you love?

39:41.080 --> 39:42.433
For my beautiful mother.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.998
And for my beautiful
and sometimes sceptical sister.

39:50.040 --> 39:53.271
- Brandon, are you feeling all right?
- Never better.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.235
Well, Brenda seems
to be finally snapping out of it.

39:57.400 --> 39:58.992
She went to the movies with Donna.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.149
That's good.

40:00.320 --> 40:01.719
And Brandon's driving all over

40:01.880 --> 40:05.031
keeping half the neighbourhood awake
with his new car stereo.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.791
Honey, what's the matter?

40:11.200 --> 40:13.998
l still can't believe
lris signed those papers.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.829
Well, l'm sure she had her reasons.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.278
l know Brenda would hate
to hear me say this right now,

40:23.880 --> 40:26.155
but with everything we've been through
with Dylan,

40:26.320 --> 40:27.719
l kind of feel like he's a son to me.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.953
- Yeah, l know.
- l keep asking myself,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.912
would l throw my own son
to the wolves like this?

40:35.640 --> 40:36.755
The answer is no.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.276
Well, what are you gonna do?

40:39.440 --> 40:41.715
For starters,
l'm going to tell the attorneys

40:41.880 --> 40:43.552
to take their time
drawing up the papers.

40:43.720 --> 40:46.188
But then what?
l mean, are you gonna sign?

40:46.680 --> 40:48.432
l really don't know.

40:51.560 --> 40:53.596
Well, congratulations, kid.
l gotta hand it to you.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.320
lris came, lris saw, you conquered.

40:56.480 --> 40:59.153
l'm not out to conquer anybody, Jack,
least of all my own mother.

40:59.320 --> 41:01.072
Oh, l know. l know.
But she signed, didn't she?

41:01.240 --> 41:03.993
Just like l knew she would.
Cigar, anybody?

41:05.680 --> 41:06.795
l take it that means no.

41:06.960 --> 41:09.315
Well, this one is in celebration
of my new family.

41:10.080 --> 41:13.231
You and me, son. And at the risk
of sounding sentimental,

41:13.400 --> 41:16.949
l just wanna say that l haven't been
this happy in a long time.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.279
l'm glad.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.957
So are you gonna stay here tonight
or what?

41:22.120 --> 41:24.076
No, l figured
we'd just go back to my place.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.559
Suit yourself. l'm gonna turn in.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.153
Good night, Jack. Thanks for dinner.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.239
Anytime, Kelly. Anytime.

41:30.520 --> 41:31.873
Good night.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.992
Hey, you didn't even eat dinner.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.354
l'm not very hungry.

41:36.520 --> 41:40.069
All right, but no dessert
till you eat your vegetables.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.114
Yeah.

41:45.400 --> 41:48.233
Jack, l think l left my jacket in there.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.516
Come on in. Hang on for a second.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.673
lsn't it right there?

41:55.960 --> 41:58.190
- Yeah, sorry. Good night.
- Good night, son.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.112
Oh, hey, close the door,
will you, buddy?

42:05.720 --> 42:09.429
Listen, l lied through my teeth
to my kid to get that money.

42:09.600 --> 42:13.275
Now, you guys hold up your end
of the bargain, or the deal is off.
