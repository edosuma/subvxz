WEBVTT

01:42.950 --> 01:45.160
Car number 6,
we are moving.

01:46.270 --> 01:48.380
"4 alpha", repeat, "4 alpha".

01:48.380 --> 01:50.360
Window seat, his
team's on all sides.

01:50.540 --> 01:51.390
Copy that.

02:52.660 --> 02:53.600
Speed?

02:54.440 --> 02:56.570
238 km/h and
holding steady.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.640
You alright over there?

02:59.110 --> 03:01.240
I do love getting
me some bad guys.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.110
Wait! Wait!
Civilian in play, I repeat

03:17.110 --> 03:18.410
civilian in play.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.160
- Clear.
- Confirm.

03:37.590 --> 03:38.870
Confirmed.
Clear, code green.

03:51.030 --> 03:52.260
Are we shipping to
the same place?

03:52.380 --> 03:53.300
Yes, sir.

03:53.580 --> 03:54.810
Alright.

03:55.210 --> 03:56.820
That was your best ever.

03:57.350 --> 03:58.490
I was... I was impressed.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.110
Where I hit him?

04:00.490 --> 04:01.430
Neck.

04:02.250 --> 04:03.860
On a moving train.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.220
- You took a video?
- Yeah, I took video.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.680
Man, meet everybody else, look.

04:17.769 --> 04:19.040
- Delete it.
- Henry.

04:19.230 --> 04:20.649
Come on, listen.

04:21.279 --> 04:23.250
4 shooters wift on this guy
before you got the call.

04:23.410 --> 04:24.410
Alright, 4.

04:24.470 --> 04:25.770
All of 'em studs.

04:26.020 --> 04:27.690
And you bring him off.

04:28.380 --> 04:29.450
That was beautiful, alright.

04:29.450 --> 04:31.020
I got emotional, tear fell.

04:31.350 --> 04:32.320
Delete it.

04:32.660 --> 04:33.570
I'll delete it.

04:33.890 --> 04:35.450
I'll delete it, alright.

05:23.840 --> 05:24.960
Can't do this.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.440
What's up, my brother?

05:29.490 --> 05:30.800
You alright?

05:32.660 --> 05:33.850
I got him in his neck.

05:34.170 --> 05:36.110
But I was aiming
at his head.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.800
Other lines of work
you can lose a step.

05:38.810 --> 05:39.710
Not this one.

05:39.790 --> 05:42.340
You still the best we got.
Best anyone's got.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.120
Believe me, I keep track.

05:44.250 --> 05:45.500
Not a soda, not today.

05:45.630 --> 05:47.300
- Meaning?
- Give me a beer.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.840
Are you sure?

05:48.930 --> 05:50.730
- Are you really retiring?
- Yes, sir.

05:50.860 --> 05:52.290
Then I'm sure.

05:52.440 --> 05:53.440
Okay.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.170
A lot of guys can shoot, Dell.

06:00.870 --> 06:03.510
They aren't you, they don't
have the history you do.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.330
Yeah, I think the... the history

06:05.500 --> 06:06.780
might be the problem.

06:07.580 --> 06:08.240
Henry.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.870
We've been through a lot
together, you and me.

06:12.350 --> 06:13.760
We do world safer.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.380
I just not gonna trust a
new guy like I trust you.

06:20.550 --> 06:22.570
There was a kid...

06:23.340 --> 06:25.400
beautiful little girl.

06:25.690 --> 06:27.370
Right next to him.

06:28.220 --> 06:31.170
If I'm 6 inches off -

06:32.360 --> 06:34.300
she's dead.

06:35.030 --> 06:36.600
Understand?

06:37.260 --> 06:38.630
This time

06:40.160 --> 06:41.870
I got lucky.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.750
I didn't feel the shot.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.770
Not like I should have.

06:49.030 --> 06:51.220
72 kills, Dell.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.400
That shit starts to
mess with you a little bit.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.540
Deep down it's like...

06:59.180 --> 07:01.770
my soul was hurt.

07:03.310 --> 07:04.510
I just want some peace.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.860
So, what do I do now?

07:12.330 --> 07:14.060
Wish me well.

07:34.780 --> 07:35.690
Good morning.

07:36.230 --> 07:37.550
Hey, where's Jerry?

07:37.710 --> 07:38.760
Jerry retired.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.920
They couldn't take anymore
of his bustling pace.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.060
I'm Danny.

07:43.060 --> 07:44.730
Hey Danny, I'm Henry.

07:46.150 --> 07:49.290
I owe you $23.46.

07:49.430 --> 07:50.730
Okay, thank you, Henry.

07:53.260 --> 07:54.930
So, what are you fishing for?

07:55.330 --> 07:56.800
Peace and quiet

07:57.490 --> 07:58.750
and mackerel.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.790
Head now to Preachers Point?

08:01.320 --> 08:02.830
Is that what you recommend?

08:02.950 --> 08:04.860
Well, seems like a
nice enough day for it.

08:13.380 --> 08:15.920
Not much of a "live and let live"
guy, I take it.

08:16.050 --> 08:18.110
I'm deathly allergic to bees.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.670
You a student or
just a fish whisperer?

08:21.970 --> 08:24.170
I'm working my way
to grad school.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.170
Marine biology.

08:26.330 --> 08:27.750
UGA, Darian?

08:28.010 --> 08:29.450
Go dogs.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.420
Well, you be careful around here.

08:31.420 --> 08:34.460
There is some dogs out
on these docks too.

08:35.179 --> 08:36.960
Nothing I can't handle.

08:53.270 --> 08:55.820
Well, I guess I don't
have to ask how business is.

08:57.190 --> 08:58.800
Could have been yours.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.130
Only asked you 10 times.

09:05.540 --> 09:06.860
Hey brother.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.730
- It's good to see you, Henry.
- You too, Jack.

09:12.430 --> 09:14.810
What you doing there?
Feeling sexy?

09:16.370 --> 09:18.410
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- Of course.

09:19.190 --> 09:21.320
- You still married?
- Yup.

09:21.540 --> 09:24.140
Wife's on a shopping
trip to Paris.

09:24.580 --> 09:26.290
Son's in boarding school.

09:26.820 --> 09:27.550
You?

09:27.550 --> 09:30.440
No, no wife,
no kids, no Paris.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.230
Here's to the next war -

09:33.270 --> 09:35.320
- which is no war.
- which is no war.

09:40.520 --> 09:41.980
So, what've you got?

09:47.740 --> 09:49.210
Recognise him?

09:51.240 --> 09:52.340
Who's asking?

09:52.720 --> 09:54.860
Your old friend who's afraid
you're in trouble.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.730
Do you?

09:59.300 --> 10:00.810
I AMF'ed him in LiÃ¨ge.

10:00.930 --> 10:02.600
They tell you who he was?

10:03.480 --> 10:05.540
Valery Dormov.
Terrorist.

10:05.590 --> 10:06.590
No.

10:07.210 --> 10:10.040
Valery Dormov.
Molecular biologist.

10:10.250 --> 10:14.120
Who worked here in the
States for 30 years.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.570
I read his file.

10:17.140 --> 10:18.200
Bio-terrorist.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.810
The file was spiked.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.720
I don't know by who.

10:23.270 --> 10:24.530
Why?

10:24.710 --> 10:26.370
I don't know that, either.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.230
Where are you getting this from?

10:29.180 --> 10:30.800
A friend.

10:31.390 --> 10:32.180
From the other side.

10:32.450 --> 10:33.080
Alright, well.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.280
- I need to talk to him.
- Sure.

10:35.870 --> 10:38.000
Skype? Facetime?

10:39.590 --> 10:41.660
I need to talk to him, Jack.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.330
Oh, what a hell.

10:45.480 --> 10:46.990
He owes me.

10:52.490 --> 10:54.160
I hope I'm wrong.

10:55.470 --> 10:57.260
I just want you to be careful.

11:05.430 --> 11:08.930
It's me got full of things
I didn't do in my DIA years.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.500
You think you didn't do that
in your DIA years?

11:16.310 --> 11:17.650
This guy.

11:23.470 --> 11:24.790
They tell you who he was?

11:25.790 --> 11:27.910
Valery Dormov.
Terrorist.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.260
No.

11:29.410 --> 11:32.250
Valery Dormov.
Molecular biologist.

11:32.250 --> 11:36.030
Who worked here in
the States for 30 years.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.620
You took a real
risk contacting me.

11:40.670 --> 11:41.670
I wish you hadn't.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.970
What was I supposed to do?

11:44.250 --> 11:45.250
I love you, brother.

11:47.130 --> 11:48.490
You too.

11:50.660 --> 11:51.910
It's a pitty.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.950
I've always liked Henry.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.580
Henry is DIA, Clay.

11:55.960 --> 11:56.850
He's one of mine.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.360
He knows you lied to him.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.770
We have a tail on him.

11:59.770 --> 12:02.960
Standard protocol for retirement.
He'll be contained.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.440
Contained?
Henry Brogan?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.700
He has Dormov's contact.

12:09.340 --> 12:13.580
He's gonna pull on that thread
until he's pointing a gun at our faces.

12:14.390 --> 12:16.770
What about his handler,
the bald guy?

12:16.930 --> 12:17.570
Patterson?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.580
He won't be happy, but he
won't cross me, he'll fall in line.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.340
I'll tie this off.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.870
Make it look like a Russian op.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.320
You'll do nothing!

12:26.480 --> 12:28.280
I'll tell my team
that Henry's gone rogue.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.460
I can handle this.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.410
Right after you wift
4 times on Dormov.

12:31.540 --> 12:33.370
No.
You need Gemini.

12:33.810 --> 12:36.420
I will not let you do hints
on American soil.

12:36.510 --> 12:39.440
You don't have anyone
who can take on Henry Brogan.

12:40.490 --> 12:41.490
I do.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.340
We'll clean up our
own messes, thank you.

12:45.890 --> 12:50.380
Everything that we worked for is
at stake thanks to your failures.

12:50.380 --> 12:53.010
You have one chance
not to screw this up.

12:53.870 --> 12:54.950
Please.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.830
Surprise me.

13:43.860 --> 13:45.340
Any luck?

13:48.370 --> 13:49.470
Okay.

13:49.810 --> 13:52.740
Most guys try flowers or a
playlist they think I'll find romantic.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.160
Are you DIA?

13:55.490 --> 13:57.510
That depends what's DIA?

13:57.680 --> 13:59.270
Dance Instructors of America.

14:00.030 --> 14:01.850
Did Patterson send you
to surveil me?

14:02.800 --> 14:05.040
- Patterson?
- Del Patterson?

14:05.330 --> 14:07.580
Funny coincidence,
he was just here.

14:08.010 --> 14:09.220
Look, you're burnt.

14:09.220 --> 14:10.550
Your cover's blown.

14:11.810 --> 14:12.760
Okay, well I was just...

14:12.910 --> 14:14.220
in the middle of
Marvin Gaye song,

14:14.220 --> 14:15.290
so I'm gonna go back to that.

14:15.390 --> 14:17.660
Name 3 buildings on a
Darian Campus.

14:18.130 --> 14:20.820
- Really?
- Come on, marine biologist.

14:21.810 --> 14:24.060
Rhodes Hall, McCourter Hall, Rocker Hall.

14:24.060 --> 14:25.290
Now I know you're DIA.

14:25.730 --> 14:27.510
Civilian would've told
me to piss off.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.320
Not a polite civilian.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.340
You good, you good.

14:32.340 --> 14:33.540
Where you live?

14:33.830 --> 14:34.830
What?

14:35.130 --> 14:36.740
No, I wanna see your place.

14:37.740 --> 14:38.740
Excuse me?

14:38.990 --> 14:41.950
Where, I am sure I
won't find a single book

14:41.950 --> 14:43.090
on marine biology.

14:43.950 --> 14:47.300
But I'm certain I'll find a
big ol' fold on Henry Brogan.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.640
Excuse me?

14:48.750 --> 14:51.740
Okay, this has been fun,
but I kinda have to do that job.

14:51.820 --> 14:52.970
Sorry, sir.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.580
Yeah, I got the
30-feet bowrider.

14:54.580 --> 14:55.850
- Okay.
- Needs some gas and...

14:55.850 --> 14:56.620
Hey, sir.

14:56.950 --> 14:57.710
One sec.

15:00.350 --> 15:01.970
I'm sorry, I...

15:02.060 --> 15:03.530
Can I buy you a drink?

15:04.650 --> 15:06.600
Why, so you can keep
interrogating me?

15:06.650 --> 15:10.100
No, I'm probably gonna
spend the whole time apologising.

15:10.680 --> 15:11.920
Pelican Point?

15:12.110 --> 15:14.240
Sunday nights,
they have a great band.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.110
Please, what time do
you get off work?

15:21.660 --> 15:24.380
- 7.
- Think I also need a 12-volt bilge pump.

15:24.460 --> 15:25.900
Alright, I'll see you at 7.

15:26.950 --> 15:29.150
Just leave the crazy
at home, please.

15:29.350 --> 15:30.350
Alright.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.240
Sorry about earlier.

15:52.580 --> 15:55.310
Bad habits.
I don't trust people easily.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.180
But I'm sure you don't either.

15:58.380 --> 15:59.950
Why would you say that?

16:09.580 --> 16:11.150
Where did you get that?

16:11.360 --> 16:15.140
25 years of faithful service
you make some friends.

16:16.780 --> 16:18.580
Now I'm burnt.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.980
Toast.

16:21.210 --> 16:23.320
Is Patterson running you?

16:29.910 --> 16:31.800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:33.970 --> 16:36.760
Boilermaker is a cop drink.
You got cops in your family?

16:36.910 --> 16:38.280
My dad was FBI.

16:38.990 --> 16:41.140
And pretty big on
serving our country.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.100
Was?

16:43.620 --> 16:45.180
Yeah, he died off duty.

16:45.330 --> 16:46.910
Trying to stop a bank robbery.

16:47.820 --> 16:49.670
Sorry about that.

16:51.030 --> 16:54.350
File says you were 4 years in Navy
"Fifth Fleet", Bahrain.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.530
Yeah, did love the sea.

16:56.530 --> 16:59.840
Didn't love being stuck on a tin can with
couple of hundreds sailors, though.

17:00.150 --> 17:00.600
Yeah.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.760
Beats a bunker in Mogadishu.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.420
So, then DIA.

17:08.530 --> 17:11.010
Defence Clandestine Services.

17:11.010 --> 17:12.810
Recruiting, running assets.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.819
Not a single demerit.

17:16.690 --> 17:17.440
I mean...

17:18.089 --> 17:20.960
So then the Inspector General
sticks you on a dock

17:20.960 --> 17:23.630
to watch a guy who
just wants to retire?

17:24.950 --> 17:26.700
That doesn't bother you?

17:32.620 --> 17:34.270
Well, this is adios, Henry.

17:34.870 --> 17:36.790
It's been nice surveilling you.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.390
I'll be sent somewhere
else tomorrow.

17:39.740 --> 17:40.460
Yeah.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.750
You... you want a ride home?

17:41.960 --> 17:44.530
No, thanks, my apartment
is just right over there.

17:48.420 --> 17:50.570
Henry, why are you retiring?

17:54.430 --> 17:59.080
I'm finding myself avoiding
mirrors lately, so...

17:59.760 --> 18:01.800
I'm gonna take that as a sign.

18:03.010 --> 18:04.300
Watch your six out there.

18:04.680 --> 18:05.680
You too.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.200
Night, Toast.

18:18.860 --> 18:21.010
You should come
look at the stars, Jack.

19:11.390 --> 19:13.390
<i>- You have to work on your kick.
- Charlie.</i>

19:13.540 --> 19:14.730
<i>- Concentrate, Henry.
- Come one! </i>

19:14.870 --> 19:16.550
<i> You are 5 now and this
is not hard.</i>

19:16.870 --> 19:18.310
<i>Now.
Try again.</i>

20:08.670 --> 20:10.620
Hi, this is Jack, I'm sailing.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.510
Please tell me this means
we're back in business.

20:18.670 --> 20:19.480
Where are you?

20:19.940 --> 20:21.430
Just some guy.
I'm on surveliance.

20:21.430 --> 20:22.430
Get out of there, now!

20:22.550 --> 20:25.160
Do not go home, do not
go to your girl's house.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.660
Go to the bus station,
get a ticket, in cash.

20:27.900 --> 20:30.770
Do not use ATM.
Go somewhere where nobody knows you.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.500
You sure?

20:32.920 --> 20:36.120
They're outside my window, sorry man
I made you a loose end.

20:36.150 --> 20:37.240
Come on man, I'll be fine.

20:37.390 --> 20:38.540
How do I contact with you?

20:38.540 --> 20:40.580
You don't.
Don't contact anybody.

20:40.660 --> 20:41.980
Especially anybody from the DIA.

20:42.060 --> 20:43.910
And get rid of your phone.
Now.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.440
Oh, come on, Henry.
Stop.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.890
Marino?

21:18.830 --> 21:20.460
It's not gun time.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.040
It's coffee time.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.280
Do you have a burn bag?

21:24.330 --> 21:26.320
First, tell me what
you're doing here.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.320
Somebody just sent
a team to kill me.

21:29.610 --> 21:31.110
And you're still asleep.

21:31.350 --> 21:33.690
That means you didn't
know about it, correct?

21:33.770 --> 21:35.760
No, of course not.
I would've told you.

21:40.070 --> 21:41.790
That means you're next.

21:42.570 --> 21:43.550
Get dressed.

21:47.170 --> 21:49.820
All the boats have dupe keys
in the office, right?

21:50.190 --> 21:51.670
You got a fast one?

22:01.370 --> 22:03.080
Feeling the call of the sea?

22:07.170 --> 22:08.420
Where is he?

22:09.170 --> 22:10.370
You can tell me now.

22:11.790 --> 22:12.820
Hey, drop!

22:15.060 --> 22:16.320
Bitch!

22:17.140 --> 22:20.790
You can tell me now, or you can
tell me in 5 minutes minus your teeth.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.290
But you gonna tell me.

22:39.650 --> 22:40.590
I counted 3.

22:40.770 --> 22:42.000
How many did you bring?

23:07.230 --> 23:08.340
Who sent you?

23:08.920 --> 23:11.700
You can tell me now or you
can tell me in 5 minutes...

23:11.700 --> 23:13.180
minus your teeth.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.380
You alright?

23:21.320 --> 23:23.270
- It's Lassiter.
- How do you know?

23:38.320 --> 23:39.740
You get on this boat
you leave behind

23:39.740 --> 23:41.690
everything and
everybody you've ever known.

23:41.690 --> 23:42.930
Do you understand that?

23:56.670 --> 23:57.810
Scared is good.

23:57.950 --> 23:59.350
It means you're alert.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.180
Never had anybody
trying to kill me before.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.440
Yeah, well, the important
thing is - you didn't.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.850
What scares you?
Other than bees.

24:10.380 --> 24:11.780
Drowning.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.480
So this is you cleaning
up your own messes?

24:42.480 --> 24:43.830
Spare me the lecture.

24:44.140 --> 24:47.220
It's like watching the Hindenburg
crash into the Titanic.

24:47.340 --> 24:49.190
Tell me what we're
going to do about Henry.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.460
Henry Brogan is like
any other soldier.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.310
When they're young and stupid
they believe anything you tell them.

24:54.310 --> 24:55.670
Then they get older, they

24:55.790 --> 24:56.790
wear out.

24:57.510 --> 24:59.180
Grow a conscious.

25:00.590 --> 25:03.790
This is why we need
a new breed of soldier.

25:05.480 --> 25:06.920
Gemini will handle this.

25:07.550 --> 25:08.780
I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.380
I'm not asking
your permission.

25:10.380 --> 25:11.990
You wanna go to your bosses?

25:11.990 --> 25:14.990
I am sure they'd love to hear
about our little rogue project.

25:16.830 --> 25:19.370
I'll make it look
like a Russian hit.

25:19.370 --> 25:21.270
You give Henry a state funeral.

25:22.010 --> 25:24.890
Fly on the coffin.
21-gun salute.

25:25.940 --> 25:27.960
You give a nice speech,
everyone cries.

25:28.030 --> 25:29.640
He'd be remembered as a hero.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.120
Life goes on.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.020
- Not for Henry.
- Oh, come on.

25:34.020 --> 25:37.060
Muds like Henry look born
into be collateral damage.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.070
Let's not pretend otherwise.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.590
Do you have an asset in place?

25:41.720 --> 25:43.770
I have the trophy asset.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.310
- Alright
- Just...

25:50.590 --> 25:51.510
No, I'm good.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.010
You hungry?

25:57.740 --> 26:00.600
Yeah, I'm starving, but those
things expired 2 years ago.

26:02.340 --> 26:03.060
Really?

26:04.320 --> 26:05.500
Still taste good.

26:07.710 --> 26:10.600
While he still had teeth
that guy said you were the rogue.

26:11.470 --> 26:12.660
And you believed him?

26:14.040 --> 26:16.260
99% sure he was lying.

26:17.190 --> 26:19.020
But 1% sucks, doesn't it?

26:25.020 --> 26:26.890
Henry, has this ever
happened to you before?

26:27.010 --> 26:28.040
Which part?

26:28.470 --> 26:30.440
Your own government
trying to kill you.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.470
Nah, that's new.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.570
You've been in agency a while and
can't you guess what this is all about?

26:37.940 --> 26:41.770
Trust me, if I could I would not be
on this lovely vacation with you.

26:43.650 --> 26:44.650
Well.

26:45.830 --> 26:49.380
When I'm the head of the agency we
gonna handle retirement very differently.

27:08.700 --> 27:09.690
My man.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.200
Baron tour is here
to pick up Brogan.

27:19.450 --> 27:20.450
Party of two.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.210
- Good to see you man.
- You too.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.410
Danny, meet the Baron.

27:29.550 --> 27:32.630
Middle-aged reprobate and
best pilot I've ever known.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.180
Danny, Baron.

27:34.380 --> 27:35.380
Hey, Toast.

27:37.170 --> 27:38.750
Got your appliences requested.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.610
For now, you can hold
up to my place at Cartagena.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.750
You'll be anonymous and safe.

27:43.900 --> 27:46.960
Yeah, we're kinda
in the shit here, man.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.480
I think Jack dead.

27:51.970 --> 27:53.950
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

27:54.650 --> 27:56.390
- Anyone follow you?
- No.

27:56.390 --> 27:57.930
They will.
Let's go.

27:58.380 --> 28:00.330
- Can I have one of those crackers?
- Sure.

28:00.640 --> 28:01.640
Thanks.

28:12.130 --> 28:13.690
Does he do this at home?

28:14.150 --> 28:15.400
I don't think so, I don't know.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.830
- Do you?
- No.

28:16.830 --> 28:19.980
If it's inappropriate to do this
sort of thing at home.

28:19.980 --> 28:22.620
Why would you think it's appropriate
to do it in your science class?

28:22.730 --> 28:25.590
I don't know, probably because
science is so wicked boring.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.220
Hello.

28:32.380 --> 28:34.220
Guess you really didn't
want me to retire.

28:34.220 --> 28:36.620
Henry, you're okay!
Thank God!

28:36.620 --> 28:36.660
Stop it!
Henry, you're okay!
Thank God!

28:36.660 --> 28:37.620
Stop it!

28:38.430 --> 28:39.850
Is Marino dead?

28:40.700 --> 28:41.470
Yes.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.160
Jack Willis?

28:44.800 --> 28:47.260
It wasn't me. None of this was
me Henry, I swear it.

28:47.490 --> 28:48.480
I trusted you, Dell.

28:48.610 --> 28:51.620
You still can. Let me call you
on another line.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.500
You got 30 seconds.

29:02.580 --> 29:03.610
Hey, excuse me.

29:03.610 --> 29:04.930
Could you borrow a
phone for 5 minutes

29:04.930 --> 29:06.930
if I gave you a hundred bucks?

29:09.450 --> 29:11.420
We'll start with who's idea
it was to send a team

29:11.420 --> 29:14.420
to agent Zakarweski's apartment,
was that necessary?

29:14.420 --> 29:17.780
Also not my call, she's working
for the Inspector General, not me.

29:17.850 --> 29:18.880
Is she with you?

29:18.880 --> 29:19.620
Yes.

29:19.780 --> 29:20.900
Not voluntarily.

29:20.900 --> 29:24.370
Okay, listen, this is not something
I wanna say over the phone.

29:24.550 --> 29:26.480
I'm at my kids, goddamn, school!

29:26.550 --> 29:28.600
What a hell is all of this?!

29:30.870 --> 29:32.430
We have a problem.

29:33.070 --> 29:34.500
Gemini.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.930
Your old friend, working with
Janet Lassiter and her people.

29:38.050 --> 29:39.900
I can't stop them.

29:41.470 --> 29:43.450
Okay, Dormov.

29:43.850 --> 29:46.330
Did he have something
to do with Gemini?

29:47.300 --> 29:50.230
Dormov, the guy that you had
me popped on the train.

29:50.230 --> 29:52.590
Because you said he
was a Russian terrorist.

29:52.590 --> 29:54.190
Was he working for Gemini?

29:55.280 --> 29:56.820
Once upon a time.

29:58.090 --> 30:01.570
So you got me pulling
triggers For Clay Verris.

30:01.790 --> 30:04.590
Henry, I regret my
lack of candor, but listen...

30:04.590 --> 30:05.170
How many other times
you do this to me, Dell?
Henry, I regret my
lack of candor, but listen...

30:05.170 --> 30:07.350
How many other times
you do this to me, Dell?

30:08.480 --> 30:09.640
How many times you spiked a file,

30:09.760 --> 30:12.500
send me off to AMF somebody
who didn't deserve it?

30:12.690 --> 30:14.940
Never, ever.
This was the one-off.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.540
I swear on my son's life.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.370
Alright, look.

30:21.370 --> 30:23.800
Agent Zakarweski is
not a part of this.

30:23.930 --> 30:26.960
Henry, we can fix this.
I swear, but I need

30:26.960 --> 30:28.630
both of you to come back.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.180
To what, Dell?

30:34.440 --> 30:36.540
Okay, Gemini.

30:36.540 --> 30:37.530
What do you know about it?

30:37.530 --> 30:40.100
Privatized paramilitary
owned by Clay Verris.

30:40.100 --> 30:41.840
Agency does a lot of
business with them.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.840
Is there more?

30:43.800 --> 30:46.000
Baron and I served under
Verris in the Marines:

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
in Panama, Kuwait, Somalia.

30:48.950 --> 30:52.270
After he left the military, he started
Gemini and tried to hire us.

30:52.270 --> 30:53.370
We both told him "no".

30:53.370 --> 30:55.800
Except I was smart enough
to move 1500 miles away.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.060
Yeah.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.330
I blowed that one.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.190
Verris gets billions of
dollars a year to take

31:18.190 --> 31:21.170
out targets in any
way he sees fit.

31:21.650 --> 31:23.070
That's Gemini:

31:23.070 --> 31:26.500
off-book kidnappings,
tortures.

31:26.970 --> 31:29.960
They who you call when
you need 12 Saudi princes

31:29.960 --> 31:32.200
to quietly disappear.

31:32.430 --> 31:35.080
Or you want somebody
to train your death squads.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.570
6 weeks into Sniper School

31:38.850 --> 31:41.450
Clay Verris takes me out
on this boat for 5 miles.

31:42.410 --> 31:45.100
Ties this weights to my ankles,
tosses me overboard.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.690
Tells me tread water
as long as I can.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.240
And he didn't know
about your fear of...

31:50.240 --> 31:52.250
Of course did.
That was the point.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.780
So what did you do?

31:59.180 --> 32:01.670
I tread water for
as long as I could.

32:03.890 --> 32:05.740
And then I drowned.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.090
Dead.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.340
He fished me out,
pat on my chest.

32:15.890 --> 32:20.310
Told me I was now ready
to serve under his command.

32:24.380 --> 32:25.840
A toast.

32:29.560 --> 32:31.420
To the next war...

32:31.420 --> 32:33.150
- which is no war.
- which is no war.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.160
No war.

32:34.940 --> 32:36.290
We'll figure out in the morning.

32:36.290 --> 32:37.880
Right now we can
use some --.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.210
Sure, you folks
want one room or...

32:40.210 --> 32:41.740
Two.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.230
Two, two.

32:48.550 --> 32:51.230
Yeah, I can put him
in the garage if you want.

32:51.230 --> 32:52.830
Alright, two rooms will be fine.

32:52.870 --> 32:55.810
Just giving you options.
Okay, right this way.

33:36.660 --> 33:39.830
Sniper, rooftop, I leave,
he's gonna follow.

33:40.270 --> 33:42.230
I need you to go with
Baron some place safe.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.320
Alright?

33:47.780 --> 33:49.750
Shooter, on the roof.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.210
You are a shiity house
guest, you know that?

33:53.210 --> 33:56.550
- How the hell did they find us?
- She's good, she's really good.

33:56.550 --> 33:58.560
She just doesn't know
what she doesn't know.

33:58.750 --> 34:00.240
Take care of her, alright?

36:18.920 --> 36:20.140
Stop right there!

36:22.840 --> 36:24.170
Who are you?

36:25.230 --> 36:26.890
I don't wanna shoot you!

36:28.490 --> 36:29.790
Fine.

36:30.340 --> 36:31.360
Don't shoot me.

36:32.090 --> 36:33.470
But I'm gonna shoot you.

36:35.680 --> 36:37.440
I could have killed
you on the roof.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.580
Maybe you should have.

36:42.890 --> 36:45.150
Did they show you a
picture of me?

36:46.110 --> 36:47.970
Yeah, you look old.

36:51.990 --> 36:54.970
Kid, you take one step closer.

36:55.180 --> 36:57.230
You gonna leave me no choice.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.730
Get off! Get off!

38:21.530 --> 38:22.530
Move, move!

38:34.020 --> 38:35.380
Get out of the way!

41:25.620 --> 41:27.840
Stop. Stop. Stop!

41:46.750 --> 41:48.190
Hands up!

42:03.160 --> 42:04.690
What the hell was that?

42:20.830 --> 42:21.980
Brogan.

42:32.010 --> 42:33.040
Thank you, sir.

42:33.580 --> 42:35.540
- Thank you, Captain.
- No problem.

42:37.340 --> 42:40.380
Your place is burnt, give me
somewhere I can see him coming.

42:43.140 --> 42:45.050
I wanted to go in
there guns blazing.

42:45.200 --> 42:47.700
But she thought that diplomatic
approach made more sense.

42:48.230 --> 42:50.730
Yeah, gunfire might
have been kinder.

42:51.370 --> 42:52.830
Great work in there.

42:52.910 --> 42:54.230
What now?

42:54.330 --> 42:55.990
I need you to get
me to Budapest.

42:56.630 --> 42:57.920
- What's in Budapest?
- What's in Budapest?

42:58.690 --> 43:00.760
Jack's informer - Yuri.

43:01.480 --> 43:05.560
These guys aren't trying to
kill me because I wanna retire.

43:05.650 --> 43:09.070
They're coming after me because they
think Jack told me something classified.

43:09.550 --> 43:11.090
Yuri ought to know about it.

43:11.480 --> 43:14.810
I'm sorry, partner, but my Aztec
doesn't have that kind of voyage.

43:14.910 --> 43:17.570
Well, I was hoping we would
borrow something that does.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.160
Maybe a G?

43:21.620 --> 43:23.310
Taking someone's Gulfstream?

43:23.310 --> 43:25.980
I mean you.. you'd really have
to love the guy to do that.

43:28.470 --> 43:31.100
I know just the fellow.
Give me a minute.

43:33.550 --> 43:40.640
? Well, I got a woman, way over town ?

43:40.640 --> 43:45.110
? That's good to me, oh yeah ?

43:45.420 --> 43:50.020
? I got a woman, way over town ?

43:50.680 --> 43:54.790
? Good to me, oh yeah ?

43:55.230 --> 43:59.320
? She give me money when I'm in need ?

44:05.040 --> 44:05.900
Henry?

44:08.030 --> 44:09.470
Did you ever have a kid?

44:10.120 --> 44:11.600
No, why?

44:13.060 --> 44:14.440
Guy on a motorcycle.

44:15.740 --> 44:17.490
Did you notice anything
funny about him?

44:18.190 --> 44:20.010
I noticed he was very good.

44:20.190 --> 44:21.190
Right.

44:22.190 --> 44:23.870
And the face?

44:25.330 --> 44:26.300
Similarity?

44:28.830 --> 44:30.730
Yeah, I noticed that too.

44:31.050 --> 44:32.050
So...

44:32.630 --> 44:34.740
You never had a
long-term relationship?

44:34.800 --> 44:35.800
No.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.300
Unless we count you.

44:40.090 --> 44:42.790
Is it possible that you
could've had kid without knowing it?

44:42.790 --> 44:43.790
No.

44:45.550 --> 44:47.850
- Then how do you explain...
- Danny.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.630
Alright?

45:02.420 --> 45:04.350
Thank you, by the way.

45:05.420 --> 45:06.420
For?

45:06.720 --> 45:09.780
For leaving Baron's appartment,
so I wouldn't be a target.

45:11.110 --> 45:14.310
Coming and getting me in Georgia
when you could've just ran for you life.

45:14.790 --> 45:15.870
I just...

45:15.940 --> 45:20.790
wanted to put you on a private plane
and give you a free trip to Hungary.

45:21.540 --> 45:23.640
Where I am gonna find...?

45:23.810 --> 45:25.690
"Hungarians".

45:27.140 --> 45:28.320
Right.

45:32.370 --> 45:34.100
When I saw him.

45:35.740 --> 45:38.370
It was like I was
seeing a ghost.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.200
Ghost with a gun.

45:43.220 --> 45:44.270
Like...

45:44.540 --> 45:46.870
every trigger I've ever pulled.

46:18.620 --> 46:22.220
I told you to stay in Colombia
and wait for orders.

46:24.420 --> 46:26.620
I wanted to talk to you.

46:39.920 --> 46:41.970
He is very good.

46:42.570 --> 46:43.970
He's the best.

46:44.790 --> 46:46.260
That's why I sent you.

46:49.410 --> 46:53.710
He knew every move of
mine before I made it.

46:54.660 --> 46:58.230
I'd have him, right there,
and... take the shot

46:58.920 --> 46:59.870
and...

46:59.870 --> 47:01.570
he'd be gone.

47:03.100 --> 47:04.730
Like a ghost.

47:05.300 --> 47:07.560
Did you get a look at his face?

47:08.400 --> 47:13.030
Not really, I saw him
at the stairs through a dirty mirror.

47:13.100 --> 47:15.180
I thought you were on the roof.

47:15.230 --> 47:17.490
I was, he got a line on
me, I had to jump down.

47:17.490 --> 47:19.090
What do we always drill?

47:19.990 --> 47:22.810
You hold the high ground, you
put his back against the wall

47:22.820 --> 47:24.350
and you don't let him go.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.620
I know that.

47:30.940 --> 47:32.860
Whole thing was weird.

47:33.000 --> 47:33.730
Just...

47:34.130 --> 47:35.130
wicky.

47:35.620 --> 47:36.900
How?

47:37.770 --> 47:38.900
I don't know, it was...

47:39.080 --> 47:39.870
As if I were...

47:40.380 --> 47:42.180
watching it all.

47:42.900 --> 47:44.410
Who is he?

47:45.370 --> 47:49.230
Junior, this thing, that you
are struggling with, this strangeness.

47:49.270 --> 47:50.730
It's fear.

47:51.470 --> 47:52.510
Don't hate it -

47:53.600 --> 47:54.890
lean into it.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.910
Embraced it.

47:56.910 --> 47:57.780
And then overcome it.

47:57.780 --> 48:01.750
You, are right in the threshold, son.

48:03.670 --> 48:05.170
This cause.

48:08.910 --> 48:10.340
You hungry?

48:12.910 --> 48:14.210
Yes, sir.

48:14.980 --> 48:17.210
Bowl of cereals hungry?

48:19.210 --> 48:20.560
Yes, sir.

49:23.880 --> 49:26.340
Thank you. That's it. Hands up.

49:29.770 --> 49:31.810
Over here, everyboy
take the line.

49:31.810 --> 49:33.180
Everybody back to one.

49:35.060 --> 49:37.040
That's one, let's go!

49:45.930 --> 49:48.100
- Lots of new faces.
- Yeap.

49:49.130 --> 49:51.830
They'll be the first
boots on the ground in Yemen.

49:53.070 --> 49:56.250
Do they understand the rules of
engagement, or, just...

49:56.250 --> 49:58.310
whatever moves - they shoot it?

49:58.960 --> 50:01.960
They are elite,
they're disciplined.

50:02.310 --> 50:05.370
And if they get a clean shot at their
target through an appartment window

50:05.370 --> 50:05.440
they'll take it.
And if they get a clean shot at their
target through an appartment window

50:05.440 --> 50:06.440
they'll take it.

50:08.390 --> 50:11.640
You should think about
that on your way to Budapest.

50:13.340 --> 50:15.290
Henry's just landed there.

50:16.990 --> 50:18.410
You're moving out.

50:37.610 --> 50:38.770
Aniko?

50:41.320 --> 50:42.520
Thank you for your time.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.570
Here are the samples.

50:51.560 --> 50:53.040
Least I can do for you in...

50:53.480 --> 50:54.480
2 days.

50:58.550 --> 51:00.400
This I need in 2 hours.

51:04.850 --> 51:06.030
We have a meeting with Yuri.

51:06.670 --> 51:08.230
He agreed to sit with us.

51:09.250 --> 51:10.530
You alright?

51:12.070 --> 51:14.530
I think I know why is
he as good as you, Henry.

51:16.650 --> 51:18.200
He is you.

51:19.870 --> 51:20.930
What?

51:22.050 --> 51:24.850
There's a DNA lab here,
I gave them samples.

51:26.050 --> 51:28.500
Yours and the baseball
cap he was wearing.

51:29.600 --> 51:32.800
He just, he looks so much like you.
I thought he had to be your son, so I...

51:35.070 --> 51:36.750
They did 3 tests.

51:36.870 --> 51:38.550
Your DNA and his.

51:39.470 --> 51:41.330
All 3 came back identical.

51:42.100 --> 51:44.200
Not close, identical.

51:45.160 --> 51:47.020
As in, same person.

51:49.860 --> 51:51.390
He's your clone.

51:54.150 --> 51:56.710
I thought I've made a mistake that I
gave them two samples of the same person.

51:56.810 --> 51:57.810
But I didn't.

51:59.730 --> 52:01.230
He is you.

52:01.790 --> 52:03.060
How's that even possible?

52:03.060 --> 52:05.330
It's complicated,
but it's doable.

52:05.510 --> 52:08.030
All you'd really need is a
surrogate mother and a DNA sample.

52:08.030 --> 52:09.970
If they could clone a person.

52:10.160 --> 52:12.160
You'd think that
they'd clone more

52:12.220 --> 52:14.160
doctors or scientists,
not...

52:14.490 --> 52:15.490
me.

52:15.820 --> 52:17.550
They could've cloned
Nelson Mandela.

52:17.610 --> 52:21.460
Nelson Mandela couldn't kill a man
on a moving train from 2 kilometers away.

52:26.550 --> 52:29.610

52:40.950 --> 52:41.950
Yuri?

52:45.460 --> 52:46.820
Mr. Brogan?

52:57.960 --> 52:59.850
Before we begin,
I must confess.

52:59.850 --> 53:02.450
I have admired your
work for many years.

53:03.460 --> 53:07.070
Wait.
So you know who I am?

53:08.370 --> 53:10.130
"Long time listener,
first time caller", -

53:10.130 --> 53:12.130
as they say in your country.

53:13.790 --> 53:15.490
I would congratulate you

53:16.180 --> 53:17.910
on your retirement, but...

53:18.260 --> 53:19.830
your last job has...

53:20.090 --> 53:21.160
loose ends, yes?

53:21.400 --> 53:24.130
Yeah, well... My government lied to me
and then tried to kill me.

53:24.130 --> 53:25.040
If that's what you mean.

53:25.430 --> 53:26.420
Yes.

53:26.420 --> 53:29.050
In Russia, you call
that "Tuesday".

53:29.500 --> 53:32.830
But Americans, it
hurts you feelings.

53:34.190 --> 53:35.020
So.

53:35.020 --> 53:37.590
So, why was Dormov trying
to go back to Russia?

53:37.630 --> 53:39.060
And why was I sent
to kill him?

53:39.060 --> 53:40.450
Yeah, down to business.

53:40.450 --> 53:41.790
Very American.

53:42.680 --> 53:44.430
You are a busy man.

53:45.920 --> 53:48.380
We were both
friends with Jack.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.550
He was a good man.

53:50.920 --> 53:53.480
I mourn his death,
like you.

53:53.930 --> 53:55.920
But the reason you are here

53:55.920 --> 53:57.660
and I have not killed you

53:58.170 --> 53:59.170
yet.

53:59.840 --> 54:02.490
Is we share a common enemy.

54:02.890 --> 54:04.320
Clay Verris.

54:05.860 --> 54:09.120
He lured Dormov to the west,
funded his lab.

54:10.160 --> 54:12.490
And now you have met the
fruits of their labor.

54:13.040 --> 54:15.520
Dally the Sheep
was cloned in '96.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.060
- But in '95...
- I was the sheep.

54:17.060 --> 54:18.090
Take it as a compliment.
- But in '95...
- I was the sheep.

54:18.090 --> 54:19.320
Take it as a compliment.

54:20.170 --> 54:21.970
And you're the only one.

54:22.310 --> 54:25.710
With your DNA Verris raised
the boy as his his son.

54:26.690 --> 54:29.350
Trained him to be
the perfect assassin.

54:30.570 --> 54:32.650
So why was Dormov
trying to leave?

54:32.690 --> 54:34.780
For years, we tried
to lure him back.

54:35.070 --> 54:36.070
Nothing.

54:36.180 --> 54:38.060
Then last year they
had a fallen out.

54:38.280 --> 54:40.610
Dormov got scared,
reached out to me.

54:40.610 --> 54:41.610
So I...

54:41.650 --> 54:44.780
That still doesn't explain
why I was sent to kill him.

54:45.700 --> 54:48.950
We have indications Dormov
made a breakthrough.

54:49.200 --> 54:50.850
Modified human DNA.

54:51.520 --> 54:53.550
A path to mass produciton.

54:53.850 --> 54:57.380
But Dormov wanted soldiers
to be stroger, smarter.

54:57.420 --> 54:58.970
Verris...

54:59.700 --> 55:02.030
Verris wanted something else.

55:03.620 --> 55:04.970
What something else?

55:05.470 --> 55:06.470
Mr. Brogan.

55:07.320 --> 55:09.870
You are the best at what you do.

55:10.170 --> 55:11.940
But still you get tired,

55:12.150 --> 55:13.740
you have fears, doubts,

55:13.740 --> 55:16.040
you feel pain, perhaps remorse.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.030
You have a conscience.

55:19.890 --> 55:21.350
These makes you human.

55:21.950 --> 55:24.300
But sub-optimital as a soldier.

55:24.490 --> 55:26.520
Less than perfect.

55:26.590 --> 55:28.290
Less profitable.

55:31.240 --> 55:34.740
Clayton Verris is
playing God with DNA.

55:35.670 --> 55:37.520
He must be stopped.

55:39.130 --> 55:41.730
If he's that dangerous
why don't you send a missile?

55:41.730 --> 55:43.290
Blow up his lab.

55:44.230 --> 55:46.090
That is what we're doing.

55:46.510 --> 55:47.240
you
Except...

55:47.240 --> 55:48.710
you

55:49.090 --> 55:50.850
are the missile.

55:51.670 --> 55:53.420
I wish you luck.

55:55.630 --> 55:57.070
One last thing.

55:57.290 --> 55:59.620
You excaped from
home two days ago?

56:00.210 --> 56:01.220
Shit.

56:01.220 --> 56:02.220
Amazing work.

56:02.860 --> 56:05.020
I was on the edge of my seat.

56:06.020 --> 56:07.210
Wait, what?

56:08.000 --> 56:09.860
How the hell you
know about that?

56:11.500 --> 56:14.560
I'm a big fan,
what can I say?

56:19.280 --> 56:21.560
If even half of what
he's saying is true.

56:21.560 --> 56:23.140
We gotta talk to this kid.

56:23.280 --> 56:25.530
You're not gonna be
safe until you do.

56:25.530 --> 56:28.290
So you think if your 50-year
old self showed up and told you

56:28.290 --> 56:30.240
you're her clone that
would make you calmer?

56:30.240 --> 56:31.090
51.

56:32.150 --> 56:33.640
- What?
- Just saying, you're...

56:34.910 --> 56:37.290
- You know you're 51, yeah?
- I rounded.

56:38.530 --> 56:41.110
He's the mirror you don't
want to look into, Henry.

56:41.810 --> 56:44.290
But he's our best
shot in getting to Verris.

56:52.930 --> 56:54.310
Janet Lassiter?

56:55.040 --> 56:56.590
Who wants to know?

56:56.860 --> 56:58.030
I got a message for you, ma'am.

56:58.520 --> 57:00.930
From a man who transferred a $1000
into my Featherqueen account

57:00.930 --> 57:02.470
just to make sure you got it.

57:02.910 --> 57:04.330
Does this person have a name?

57:05.240 --> 57:07.620
His name is "$1000 into
my Featherquin account".

57:10.210 --> 57:11.020
<i>Hello, Janet.</i>

57:11.170 --> 57:13.630
<i>Before you try to kill
me again, consider this. </i>

57:13.910 --> 57:16.840
<i>Your home address
is 1362, Carol Grove. </i>

57:17.140 --> 57:20.010
<i>The security alarm
code is 1776. </i>

57:20.200 --> 57:22.360
<i>You awaken at 6:12
every morning. </i>

57:22.410 --> 57:25.900
<i> and stop for your decaf soy latte
with an extra shot by 6:42.</i>

57:26.440 --> 57:28.810
<i> Every night you stand in front
of your huge living room window,</i>

57:28.810 --> 57:30.940
<i>sipping a Jose Cuervo Margarita</i>

57:31.260 --> 57:33.320
<i>with Forensic Files on the TV. </i>

57:33.820 --> 57:36.900
<i>Wearing your nice,
comfy sweatpants. </i>

57:41.290 --> 57:42.410
This is Lassiter.

57:42.410 --> 57:44.890
There are shooters at
your 10 and 2.

57:44.890 --> 57:47.820
Get above of that chair,
you will be AMF'ed.

57:48.720 --> 57:50.680
Now, if I thought the world
needed another me

57:50.680 --> 57:52.130
I would've had a kid.

57:52.910 --> 57:55.080
The program predates
my arrival at the agency,

57:55.080 --> 57:56.130
You must know that.

57:56.130 --> 57:57.610
Yeah, perfect DC answer.

57:57.650 --> 57:59.880
If something goes wrong - duck.

58:00.650 --> 58:02.670
Tip the bike guy.

58:03.380 --> 58:04.380
You can go.

58:05.670 --> 58:09.020
Now, I have your agent
with me against her will.

58:09.170 --> 58:11.060
Danielle Zakarweski.

58:11.280 --> 58:12.680
She wants to come in.

58:13.420 --> 58:14.420
Fine.

58:14.520 --> 58:16.980
Now, like me, she is a patriot.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.260
Unlike me,

58:18.710 --> 58:20.840
she still wants to spend
the next couple decades

58:20.990 --> 58:23.030
scoring touchdowns
for you assholes.

58:23.980 --> 58:26.180
Her safety is non-negotiable.

58:26.720 --> 58:28.330
10 and 2, Janet.

58:28.330 --> 58:30.360
Decaf soy latte,
an extra shot for Janet?

58:30.410 --> 58:32.510
The only person I'll
turn her over to

58:32.550 --> 58:35.050
is the guy you sent
after me in Cartagena.

58:35.260 --> 58:37.510
Don't even think about
sending anybody else.

58:37.580 --> 58:40.160
Family reunion, very sweet.

58:40.500 --> 58:41.040
Yeah.

58:41.190 --> 58:44.240
Keep it up, you'll be the first
person I've ever killed for free.

58:44.840 --> 58:46.890
How quickly can you
get him to Budapest?

58:48.410 --> 58:49.870
5 minutes.

58:52.690 --> 58:53.790
Good.

58:54.240 --> 58:58.090
She'll be in the courtyard of the
Vajdahunyad Castle at midnight, tonight.

58:58.340 --> 58:59.990
Enjoy your latte.

59:01.050 --> 59:02.160
What's AMF?

59:02.550 --> 59:03.820
Adios mother fucker.

59:05.300 --> 59:06.860
How the hell does
he know we're here?

59:19.020 --> 59:20.930
This is gonna work, right?

59:21.510 --> 59:22.510
Yes.

59:23.310 --> 59:24.330
How do you know?

59:25.290 --> 59:27.470
I know his taste.

59:28.620 --> 59:30.670
Wait, are you saying
you are attracted to me?

59:31.570 --> 59:32.450
Me?

59:32.990 --> 59:34.750
Now? Hell no.

59:34.840 --> 59:38.470
But the younger, less
mature version, maybe.

59:44.850 --> 59:48.180
When I came for you in Georgia,

59:48.690 --> 59:52.570
I didn't have to think
about that, it was instinct.

59:53.490 --> 59:55.570
He was born with that too.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.720
Besides, he wants me.

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.140
Right.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.890
Lovely courtyard.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.780
I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.900
Before we go any further,
I'm gonna need you to strip.

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:26.800
I beg you pardon?

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.050
Need to be certain
you're not wearing a wire.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.300
Okay, first of all.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.080
Ma'am?

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.200
I was raised to respect my elders.

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.250
Take off your clothes, please.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.170
Turn around, please.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.110
I see you like to be thorough?

01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:47.630
Caution is kept me alive.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.450
Call this burner.

01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:03.130
Thank you.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:05.650
Brogan.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:09.350
In 12 minutes, I'm putting 2
bullets in the back of her head.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.950
Your orders are to
deliver her safely.

01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:14.000
My orders are to kill you.

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:17.660
Are you familiar with the
quartz chamber at the catacombs?

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.410
Negative.

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:21.130
We're doing it someplace
visible, where I can see you.

01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:23.400
Now you have 11 minutes.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.530
Get dressed.
We're taking a ride.

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:43.090
Cab was a smart move.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.270
Where are you from?

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.580
Your formality,
it's Southern.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.600
You know if you gonna use me
as bait and possible murder me

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.070
then the least you can do
is indulge me in some conversation.

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.110
Just outside Atlanta.

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.370
You two have a lot in common.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.050
I doubt that.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.160
You'd be surprised.

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.570
You know I started
following him too

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:14.790
just like you're doing.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.310
Then I got to know him.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:19.960
He's got a big heart, like you.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.490
What do you know
about my heart?

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.720
I know that you have one.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.900
And I know that it's telling you
that something about the job

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.670
you've been given isn't right.

01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:34.620
Job is the job, ma'am.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:50.210
I wonder how much you
payed the custodian.

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.140
Wow.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.210
Left.

01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:59.450
Undo the chain.

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:04.890
Basement.

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:07.400
You must really know the city.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.120
I watch a lot of Nat Geo.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.340
- It says "Off limits".
- Ma'am.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.900
I wonder how many
people are buried down here.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.390
Stand over there.

01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:53.080
Go.

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:56.380
If you knock out all the lights,

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.850
how are you gonna see your
own tripwire on the way out?

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.530
The granade is no joke,
I mean I get the idea.

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:05.090
Darkness neutralizes his biggest strength,
enclosed court favors you, right?

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:07.550
I mean he can't throw a
grenade without killing me too.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.740
But what if I tries gas?

01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:11.490
You know, or some
sort of sedative agent?

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.130
Gas mask and night
vision, very smart.
Way ahead of me.

01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:15.110
Gas mask and night
vision, very smart.

01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:15.850
- Over there.
- Zip ties!

01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:16.620
These must be for me?
- Over there.
- Zip ties!

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:18.140
These must be for me?

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.230
But can I ask you something?

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:23.330
Would you actually stop talking
long enough for me to answer?

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.150
How much do you
know about him?

01:06:25.290 --> 01:06:26.780
I mean, would they tell you
why they wanted him dead?

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.730
Guy cracked.

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:30.510
Killed 8 ops in a single
night and his spotter.

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.420
- That's what they told you?
- That's what he did.

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:32.910
No.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:34.460
No, not exactly.

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.780
I was there.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.350
The night all those
operatives were hit.

01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:38.750
They'd been sent to kill him,

01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:40.580
and me, by Gemini.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.060
And not that it matters,
but his sparrow shot in Virginia

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.450
and the rest of those
men went down in Savannah.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.790
Henry can shoot long distance,
but he can't shoot that long.

01:06:55.790 --> 01:06:59.020
Come on, just think.
Does that make any sense to you?

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:01.760
So you understand what I'm saying?
It doesn't...

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:03.270
Better.

01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:04.830
Fuck you.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.520
Get up.
Go.

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:24.060
Stay right there.

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:33.720
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.830
Do you know how to
light one of those?

01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:36.830
Jesus, Henry.

01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:47.029
Thanks for the tip
on the granade.

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:50.109
You were talking to
him all the time?

01:08:50.109 --> 01:08:51.109
Yeah.

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:52.880
You either search somebody.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040
Or you don't.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.210
And for the record.

01:08:57.990 --> 01:09:00.050
I do not want to kill you.

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:03.020
But I absolutely will
if I have to.

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:06.430
What did Clay Verris
tell you about me?

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.870
Okay, let me tell
you about him.

01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:14.020
Cause I know Mr. Verris well.

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:16.210
How did he start you?

01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:18.120
Hunting birds, rabbit?

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.740
About 12 years old,
he moved you up to deer.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.450
I'm guessing 19 or 20 years old,

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:26.250
the first time he ordered
you to shoot a person.

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.080
Any of these ring a true?

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:31.279
Yeah.

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:34.100
He told you to
lean into your fear.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.270
Because you were a warrior.

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:39.040
Blessed with great gifts
to defend the weak.

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:43.300
But he couldn't stop the noise.

01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:48.300
That secret part of you that always felt
a little different than everybody else.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.069
Part that felt like a weirdo.

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:53.310
You don't know shit.

01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:55.710
Kid, I know your inside
out and backwards.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.010
You allergic to bees,
you hate cilantro.

01:09:59.010 --> 01:09:59.240
You always sneeze 4 times.
You allergic to bees,
you hate cilantro.

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.250
You always sneeze 4 times.

01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:04.140
Everybody hates cilantro.

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:10.020
You're meticulous, thorough,
disciplined, relentless.

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:11.600
You love puzzles.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.940
You are a chess player, right?

01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:17.810
Good too, I bet.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:22.030
But you suffer from insomnia,
your mind never lets you sleep.

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:25.240
And even when it does, it
attacks you with nightmares.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.780
I am talking about those
3 o'clock in the morning -

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.510
"somebody please save me"
kind of nightmares.

01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:32.800
And then there's the doubts.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.800
And those are the worst.

01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:37.130
You hate them, and you
hate yourself for having them.

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:38.550
They make you feel weak.

01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:41.460
A real soldier doesn't doubt, right?

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.320
The only time you
ever trully feel happy

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:49.860
is when you're flat on your belly
about to squeeze the trigger.

01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:54.490
And at that moment,
the world makes perfect sense.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.000
How do you think I
know all of that?

01:10:58.090 --> 01:10:59.940
I don't give a shit
how you know anything.

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.300
Look at me, dummy!

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.300
Look at us!

01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:09.380
25 years ago, your father took
my blood and he cloned me.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.790
He made you

01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:12.500
from me.

01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:14.700
Our DNA is identical.

01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:16.800
He's telling you the truth.

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:17.890
Shut up!

01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:20.510
He chose me cause there's
never been anybody like me,

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:23.720
and he knew one day I was
gonna get old and then you'd step in.

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:26.130
He's been lying to
you the whole time.

01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:28.130
He told you you
were an orphan.

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.870
And of all the people in the world to
come after me why would he send you?

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:33.420
Because I'm the best.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.950
You are, obviously,
not the best.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.580
You're a hard ass hit.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.570
Guess this was supposed to
be your birthday or something that.

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:49.570
I had to die, and
you had to do it.

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:51.510
As long as I was
alive somehow,

01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:54.340
Clay's little experiment
was incomplete.

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:57.000
That's the maniac you're
pulling the trigger for.

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.140
Shut your mouth about him!

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.260
You just trying to rattle me.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.950
I'm trying to save you!

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.510
What are you, 23?

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:08.830
Still a virgin, right?

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:10.510
Yeah.

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:13.100
Dying to be in a
relationship and connect,

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.630
but terrified to
let anybody near you.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.750
Because what if somebody
actually saw who you are?

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:24.030
How could they love you?

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.940
So, everybody is just targets.

01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:29.400
And you're just a weapon.

01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:33.350
Hey! Hey!

01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:01.800
Hey!

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:21.240
Don't shoot him!

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:40.210
Don't shoot him!

01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:34.660
No! Don't!

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:35.850
Drop it!

01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:38.010
Drop it! I will shoot you!

01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:40.470
No, you won't.

01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:21.710
Take your hands off of him!

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:23.570
Let him go!

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:27.340
Right now!

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.300
I'm not you!

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.650
You hear me, old man?

01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:42.850
I'm not you!

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.820
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:50.310
- Did you hit him?
- I think so, yeah.

01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:53.050
- Where?
- Shoulder, I think.

01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:57.450
Then he'll recover.

01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:00.120
Is that a good thing?

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:19.350
You know,

01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:23.560
It's not every day you see a guy
get his ass kicked on 2 continents.

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:24.810
By himself.

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:33.430
Where to?

01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:35.530
Georgia.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.300
Is where Verris is.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.420
Man.

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.930
That poor kid.

01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:59.560
He must be terrified.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.980
Then he's going home,
walking into a buzz saw.

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:12.450
I gonna get some
sleep, you too.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.700
Not me, that's where
the ghosts are.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.980
Sleep.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.800
Tell me something.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.980
Why is it so hard
for you to kill this man?

01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:56.550
You know how much I hate
Big Hammock Park, pop?

01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.080
What?

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:03.380
Ever since I was
about 12 years old.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:08.200
We were to shoot turkeys
there for my birthday.

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:11.800
And I always hated it.

01:18:13.150 --> 01:18:14.330
But I was an orphan, right?

01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:15.540
So, how would we

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.150
even know when
my Birthday was?

01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:23.710
But you never seen me
notice so we just keep going.

01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:24.810
Okay, so...

01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:24.820
Next year we'll
try Chuck E. Cheese.
Okay, so...

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:26.840
Next year we'll
try Chuck E. Cheese.

01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:29.630
Yeah.

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:32.260
You, me

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:34.000
and the lab guys,

01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:35.150
who made me.

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:43.180
Yeah.

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.610
I...

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.710
Always believed

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:57.060
you'd be happier not knowing.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.940
Happy?

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.510
You know when
I'm happy, pop?

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.860
When I'm flat on my belly,

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.510
about to squeeze the trigger.

01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:14.410
It's the only time I'm happy.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.750
And this wasn't
even a mistake.

01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:22.630
It's not like you got
someone pregnant

01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:25.850
and then had to man
up and raise me.

01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.390
No, you...

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:28.890
made a decision.

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:32.840
To have a scientist
make a person

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.220
out of another person.

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:35.570
No, that's not what it was.

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:37.290
That's exactly what it was.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.340
Then you sent me

01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:42.850
to kill him.

01:19:42.850 --> 01:19:46.350
Of all the shooters in
the world, why would you send me?

01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:50.200
It's your darkness, you had
to walk through this on your own.

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:53.880
Maybe you're my darkness.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.780
That lie you told me.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.280
That my parents

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:06.620
dumped me at a fire station.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.030
And I believed that.

01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:13.540
Do you know how
that made me feel?

01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:15.840
It was a necessary lie.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.290
None of this shit is necessary!

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.440
You made a choice
to do this to me.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:25.690
- Can't you see how not okay I am?
- Bullshit!

01:20:26.210 --> 01:20:28.540
You forget who you
are talking to, Junior.

01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:29.900
I've seen battle.

01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:32.110
I've seen soldiers
go over the edge because

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:34.130
more of was being asked of
them than they can give.

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:35.570
That's not you.

01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:38.290
Your world is stable
and dependable.

01:20:38.290 --> 01:20:39.520
I made sure of that.

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:42.420
You have something that
Henry himself never had.

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:46.540
You have a loving,
dedicated, present father.

01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:50.260
Who tells you every, goddamnit, day that
you are precious and that you matter.

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:52.220
Jesus, the whole
point of this thing.

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:56.160
Was to give you all of Henry's
gifts without his pain, and I did.

01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.730
Don't doubt, Junior.

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:04.980
You're better than that.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.730
Come here.

01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:23.980
I love you, son.

01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:29.880
Just don't let yourself down.

01:21:58.430 --> 01:22:02.220
Like so many of my encounters,
it was short, but sweet.

01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:04.090
Thanks, baby.

01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:19.340
It should be truck
here somewhere.

01:22:28.170 --> 01:22:29.610
Don't move.

01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:35.940
What was in that?

01:22:36.610 --> 01:22:37.610
Bee venom.

01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:44.280
You can't do that.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.470
You can't do that,
he's allergic.

01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:48.620
Henry, can you breathe?

01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:50.240
Henry, try to breathe.

01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:52.450
- You okay?
- Please.

01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:54.860
Henry, Henry,
can you breathe?

01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.880
Please!

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.190
Try to breathe, Henry.
Henry!

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.790
Breathe!

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.960
- Why are you doing this?
- Come on!

01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:08.270
- Why are you doing this?
- Henry, Henry, breathe!

01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:09.420
Come on!

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:10.760
Hey, hey.

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:12.540
Breathe, Henry.

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.670
Epinephrine antihistamine.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.140
You'll be fine.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.180
I'm sorry.

01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:37.730
I had to be sure.

01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:40.060
No, it's all good.

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:42.700
It's whole shit's
been a little difficult.

01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:44.740
I hate to break up
the party, but

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.510
how the hell do you always
know where we are?

01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:51.280
They're tracking you.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.950
Do you trust me?

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.960
They chipped you.
During your surgery 3 years ago.

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:28.840
Verris.

01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:32.380
You know him too?

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.310
Panama, Kuwait, Somalia.

01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:37.510
Can you take us to him?

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.260
We need to shot him down.

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:42.930
Both of us.

01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:56.650
You grew up in
Philadelphia, right?

01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:57.690
Yeah.

01:24:57.870 --> 01:24:59.650
The place called the Bottom.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:01.990
The Bottom.

01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:05.400
Tell me about my mother.

01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:09.990
Helen Jackson Brogan.

01:25:10.170 --> 01:25:12.240
Worked two jobs for 40 years.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.380
That woman used
to whip my ass.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.540
Did you deserve it?

01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:18.860
Usually.

01:25:19.210 --> 01:25:21.430
Does being angry and stupid

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:24.040
and never really trying at
anything mean you deserve it?

01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:29.320
Our father wasn't around much,
he left when I was 5.

01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:33.010
And I think every time she
looked at me, she just saw him.

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.190
I had to get the
hell outta there.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.170
Joined the Core.

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:41.210
First time I've ever made
any real friends.

01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:42.470
'Oorah!'

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.120
Met Clay Verris there.

01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:50.550
Found something I was
really, really good at.

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.840
By the time I left, I had
medals on the chest.

01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:56.610
She was gone, and...

01:25:56.970 --> 01:25:58.440
I have become this.

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:04.040
You gotta walk away
while you still can.

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:08.480
- This is all I know.
- No, this is all he taught you.

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.480
Stop now, you can still
become something else.

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.530
Sure.

01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:18.560
A Doctor?
Lawyer?

01:26:19.230 --> 01:26:21.630
Husband, father.

01:26:21.690 --> 01:26:25.120
And all the things this job
gives you the excuse not to be.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.390
I threw all of that away.

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:33.760
It's shame to waste these
gifts the second time around.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.300
I'm sorry, what
is your name?

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:43.780
It's always been Junior.

01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:45.790
Clay Junior.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.290
I don't really know anymore.

01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:52.860
That's another really
good reason to quit.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.570
Do you sure about this?

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.160
I need to talk to him.

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.930
So, what happens
when we get to him?

01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:09.970
He's not gonna surrender.

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:19.090
That's him.

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:20.590
Can I talk to him?

01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:23.740
I want to be the one to
tell him we all BFFs now.

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.280
Take it.

01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:28.890
This is Junior.

01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:30.220
Are you with Brogan?

01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:33.130
Why would I be with him?
You sent me to kill him, didn't you?

01:27:33.130 --> 01:27:34.940
It doesn't matter, just run.

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:37.810
What?

01:27:37.810 --> 01:27:39.850
Run, get away from him.
Now.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.550
Junior, I just want you safe.

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:43.250
Why?

01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:45.870
Because I'm your
favorite experiment?

01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:49.260
No, because I'm your father
and you need to listen to me.

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:50.270
Run!

01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:54.440
- Get out off the car!
- Go!

01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:01.680
Baron!

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.090
No!

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.230
Come on!

01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:27.230
I'm sorry, Henry.

01:28:34.770 --> 01:28:36.590
- Chief Mitchell?
- Go ahead.

01:28:36.670 --> 01:28:39.390
Clay Verris, I need your
units to stand down.

01:28:40.090 --> 01:28:40.550
Sir?

01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:45.230
We're engaging with a terrorist cell that
has a weaponized biological capability.

01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:47.800
All units, go back, immediately!

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:52.540
Federal authorities have been
notified and they en route.

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.790
Affirmative, keep me
posting, Clay.

01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:55.950
Yes, sir.

01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:00.540
You gotta stand your
men down, now!

01:29:00.730 --> 01:29:02.210
You did the right
thing, Junior

01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:03.210
of walking away from him.

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.980
I did what a coward would do.

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.540
Makes me sick!

01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:09.310
I was asking too much of you.

01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:10.830
I can see that now.

01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:14.890
He deserves better than a
missile shot into his car, pop.

01:29:14.890 --> 01:29:18.160
It doesn't matter what he
deserves, he has to die.

01:29:57.450 --> 01:29:59.170
Are you gonna call
those goons off now?

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.930
No. But you can.

01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:04.140
Just fire that.
Take command.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.110
Armor's weak at the joints.
Eyes and neck are the kill shots.

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:10.350
Take right, I'll take left.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:17.980
Muscle, discipline.

01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:19.440
Watch you round count.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.910
You set, I spike.

01:30:21.170 --> 01:30:22.720
- Ready?
- Roger that.

01:30:40.050 --> 01:30:41.060
- I'm out!
- Take cover!

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:50.660
Set!

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.550
Get down!

01:31:22.130 --> 01:31:25.790
I am trying to
make you a man!

01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:30.320
I should have cloned myself.

01:31:37.650 --> 01:31:41.240
Loving, dedicated,
present father?

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.400
Right there!

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.540
Go ahead.

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:53.940
Do it.

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:06.070
How many rounds
you got left?

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:10.620
One.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.590
Okay.

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.830
I'm sorry.

01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:24.050
For what?

01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.020
For getting you into this.

01:32:26.370 --> 01:32:27.730
I was the one
surveilling you.

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:28.880
Yeah.

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:32.430
Anyway, sorry.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:35.570
Now let's fight our
way out of this thing.

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.710
You're a great partner.

01:33:42.090 --> 01:33:43.470
Thank you.

01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:45.410
Sorry I ran.

01:33:45.690 --> 01:33:46.960
Yeah, that's been
a rough night.

01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:48.900
How many more
out there?

01:33:49.130 --> 01:33:50.680
I didn't see any.

01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:51.810
Verris?

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.160
Out of commission.

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:56.490
But still alive?

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.060
Yes.

01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:30.320
Here.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.190
How bad is that?

01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:33.530
I'm fine.

01:34:35.150 --> 01:34:36.610
You're not.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.260
Hold the elevator position.

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:40.700
We gonna secure an out.

01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:52.850
Back off!

01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:21.530
Don't you feel pain?

01:37:52.890 --> 01:37:55.360
I don't know why
you're so angry, Henry?

01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:08.550
You were the
inspiration for all of this.

01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:23.430
You know where I got the idea?
Are you okay?

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.630
Khafji.

01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:32.380
Watching you go house to house,
wishing I had a whole division of men -

01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:33.910
all as good as you.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.760
Wondering if that
could be possible.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.880
You should be flattered.

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.280
You should be dead.

01:38:43.530 --> 01:38:45.690
You saw what
happened over there.

01:38:46.570 --> 01:38:48.130
An atrocities.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.440
Friends being sent home
in a pine box.

01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:56.040
Why should we accept that
If there is a better way?

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.270
And look what we created.

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.770
It's got both of us in.

01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:12.950
Don't you think
your country deserves

01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:14.620
a perfect version of you?

01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:17.730
There is no
perfect version of me,

01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:20.450
or him, or anybody.

01:39:20.710 --> 01:39:21.730
No?

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:23.950
He was on his way to Yemen.

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:24.880
Now thanks to you

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.590
his place is gonna be taken
by someone with parents.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.180
Someone who feels pain.

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.720
Fear.

01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:32.980
Which we had
edited out of him.

01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:35.710
Someone with just as
many weaknesses,

01:39:35.710 --> 01:39:37.200
as the terrorists
that we're trying to kill.

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.910
And you gonna
tell me that's better?

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.440
So why not make
a whole army of 'em?

01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:43.900
Yeah, why not?

01:39:45.450 --> 01:39:47.910
Think how many American
families we can spare.

01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:50.750
Nobody's son, or daughter
would ever have to die.

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:53.800
No vet comes home
with PTSD and kills himself.

01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:56.790
We can keep the
whole world safe

01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:59.340
without any
actual grief, so...

01:39:59.590 --> 01:40:01.550
Who would I be hurting?

01:40:02.110 --> 01:40:04.440
You're talking
about people, Clay.

01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:06.340
Henry.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:10.620
This is the most humane
thing that Gemini's ever done.

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.930
How many more of me
are running around out there?

01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:17.700
There's only one you, Junior.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.740
He was a weapon.

01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:22.950
You're my son.

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.470
And I love you.

01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:31.270
As much as any father
ever loved any kid.

01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:37.390
I don't have a father.

01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:39.680
Goodbye, Clay.

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.040
Hey, hey.

01:40:49.330 --> 01:40:50.970
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

01:40:52.670 --> 01:40:55.090
Gonna turn him in?
They not gonna try him.

01:40:55.090 --> 01:40:56.990
They not gonna
shot down his lab.

01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:59.130
We have to end
this this right now.

01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:00.260
Hey.

01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:02.980
Look at me.

01:41:04.730 --> 01:41:06.090
Look at me.

01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:08.600
You pull that trigger

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:11.790
and you gonna break something
inside of yourself.

01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:16.160
That will never
get fixed again.

01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:25.270
Don't.

01:41:30.650 --> 01:41:31.940
Let it go.

01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:34.480
Give it to me.

01:41:40.130 --> 01:41:42.320
You don't want
those ghosts.

01:41:43.450 --> 01:41:44.840
Trust me.

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.040
You should know
better than that.

01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:29.190
Surprised you give a shit.

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:31.030
Well...

01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:33.340
We can't be friends anymore.

01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:35.900
Because you did
let them try to kill me.

01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:39.270
But, that doesn't mean I wanna
see you drink yourself to death.

01:42:41.530 --> 01:42:43.560
The Gemini lab's
been dismantled.

01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:46.280
Cloning program is history.

01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:49.430
And Junior?

01:42:50.110 --> 01:42:51.580
He's untouchable.

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:54.190
No one will bother him.
Ever.

01:42:55.230 --> 01:42:57.800
And we checked,
there are no more clones.

01:42:58.990 --> 01:43:00.480
What about you?

01:43:01.330 --> 01:43:02.770
IG called.

01:43:02.770 --> 01:43:04.810
I'm looking at
charges, but

01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:07.790
if I bury Janet,
I can make a deal.

01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:10.450
She earned it.

01:43:14.170 --> 01:43:16.460
I'm really sorry, Henry.

01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:23.200
- Take care, Dell.
- Yeah, you too.
ten thirty

01:43:23.670 --> 01:43:25.560
And happy retirement.

01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:56.890
Hey.

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.670
Hey.

01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:04.650
Good to see you.

01:44:05.110 --> 01:44:06.680
Congrats on a promotion.

01:44:06.850 --> 01:44:08.290
I heard they got big plans.

01:44:08.290 --> 01:44:11.350
Well, after you pretty sure
I can handle anything.

01:44:12.670 --> 01:44:15.640
- How've you been?
- Good, just...

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:16.960
Settled Baron's estate.

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.340
Scattered his ashes
in the Caribbean.

01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:22.320
I don't know, all I
wanna do now is

01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:24.290
put some good in the world.

01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:25.920
Just gotta figure out how.

01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:27.570
Yeah, you will.

01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:30.190
You sleeping okay?

01:44:30.650 --> 01:44:31.650
Better.

01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:34.480
- No ghosts?
- Not like before.

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:37.380
Oh, and I actually looked
in the mirror the other day.

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.860
- Really?
- It wasn't horrendous.

01:44:41.530 --> 01:44:43.290
Speaking mirrors.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.300
Catch you later.

01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.320
Hey.

01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.980
What's this?

01:45:13.150 --> 01:45:14.920
This is you.

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:18.630
Passport, birth certificate,
driver's license.

01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:20.680
Apparently you got
pretty good credit.

01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:23.780
I love the name you chose.

01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:25.050
Jackson?

01:45:25.130 --> 01:45:26.270
It's my mother's name.

01:45:26.290 --> 01:45:26.700
She was my mother first.
Hey.

01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:28.570
She was my mother first.

01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:29.870
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:31.930
Don't you "yeah, yeah" me,
young man.

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.880
Come on, I know a
good place for lunch.

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.520
So you settled
down on major yet?

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:43.210
Leaning towards engineering.

01:45:43.210 --> 01:45:44.100
Engineering?

01:45:45.190 --> 01:45:47.460
Yeah, you should listen to her.

01:45:47.530 --> 01:45:50.450
If I were you,
which I sorta am,

01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:52.010
I'd go with computer science.

01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:53.030
Save that for grad school.

01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:54.490
You want start with humanities.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.260
- Okay, don't listen to her.
- Don't listen to him.

01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:57.830
You need a grounding
on the classics.

01:45:57.990 --> 01:46:00.300
Excuse me, I'm trying to
talk to myself over here.

01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.310
Yeah, you are talking to yourself,
but you're not talking to him.

01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:04.730
Look, I just made a lot of
mistakes when I was young.

01:46:04.730 --> 01:46:07.720
And I'd actually like to make
some of those mistakes myself.

01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:10.650
What I'm trying to say is, I made
them already so you don't have to.

01:46:10.710 --> 01:46:15.130
- But he's not you.
- Okay, everybody chill the hell out.

01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:18.100
I'm gonna be okay.

01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:24.590
If you're okay,

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:27.240
I'm okay.

01:46:30.750 --> 01:46:32.070
What?

01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:36.230
I just can't believe that in
30 years I'm gonna look like

01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.860
you.

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.520
What? Please.
You wish.

01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:44.010
Boy, you better hope you
look like me in 30 years.

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:49.500
This is 50-year old,
mature man meat

01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:51.120
you're looking at.

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:51.840
51.

01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:55.390
I brush, I floss.
I work hard.

01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:57.330
When you're 50, I bet
you won't be

01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:00.730
dragging your ass around the
track every morning like I do.

01:47:01.410 --> 01:47:03.790
In fact, we can race now.

01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:07.020
We can race right now, we
take it to the corner right now.
