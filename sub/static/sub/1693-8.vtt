WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:04.735
I've got 10,000 black folk
who make this city hum.

00:04.736 --> 00:06.302
Meaning what exactly?

00:06.303 --> 00:10.809
You go school these crackers,
Lest you all find out.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.785
- Come July fourth, all y'all...
- What about my husband?

00:13.786 --> 00:14.790
My son is dead.

00:14.791 --> 00:16.498
You take a bite off
everyone else's plate,

00:16.499 --> 00:18.816
Don't give nothing back
except the Christmas Turkey.

00:19.325 --> 00:22.294
I look at my father now...
he's this frail little man.

00:22.295 --> 00:24.155
When I was a kid,
he was the giant

00:24.156 --> 00:26.750
in "Jack and the beanstalk."
He can't hurt me now.

00:26.768 --> 00:29.351
- Who are you?
- Frieda Short, from downstairs?

00:29.352 --> 00:30.873
Where is... my wife?

00:30.874 --> 00:33.363
She had to pick
up some formula.

00:37.670 --> 00:40.192
Lead me on a merry chase
these five months.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.115
What are you doing here?

00:42.116 --> 00:44.392
That is my station.
This is my office.

00:44.393 --> 00:47.921
I am the assistant U.S. Attorney
prosecuting Enoch Thompson.

00:48.234 --> 00:50.861
As of this moment, there's no limit
to what we can bring in.

00:50.862 --> 00:52.397
How do you propose
to handle Nucky?

00:52.422 --> 00:54.477
- He goes to jail.
- Just kill him.

00:54.478 --> 00:55.941
I'm tellin' you it's not gonna fly.

00:55.942 --> 00:58.019
- What's the big deal?
- He's just another old timer.

00:58.020 --> 01:00.461
I'll call Chicago.
We'll get a paisan on the train.

01:00.462 --> 01:01.732
We start making
some real dough.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.007
Make your phone call.

01:04.032 --> 01:06.017
This is a file
I've kept on Nucky Thompson

01:06.018 --> 01:07.943
for the past 16 months.

01:07.944 --> 01:10.344
It runs the gamut from
bootlegging,

01:10.345 --> 01:12.476
up to
and including murder.

01:12.792 --> 01:14.496
When we're done
you'll leave

01:14.497 --> 01:17.005
and we'll not speak
a word about it.

01:17.030 --> 01:18.230
Ever.

01:24.839 --> 01:27.246
I'm a federal agent!
United States department of justice!

01:27.247 --> 01:29.643
Everyone remain calm
and stay where you are.

-DIFUNDE LA PALABRA-

03:16.690 --> 03:18.862
Some fight, huh?

03:18.896 --> 03:22.098
- Which fight?
- Dempsey-Carpentier.

03:24.499 --> 03:27.200
That fight
hasn't happened yet.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.927
Daddy eats first.

04:16.539 --> 04:19.879
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

04:19.913 --> 04:22.110
I'm sorry.

04:22.144 --> 04:26.252
- I've been having trouble sleeping.
- That's not surprising.

04:32.410 --> 04:34.850
The stigmata.

04:34.884 --> 04:38.895
Make sure to keep
this protected.

04:38.939 --> 04:42.184
Not many people
shaking it these days.

04:42.186 --> 04:45.548
It's slow all over,
I suppose.

04:45.550 --> 04:48.880
It seems
you're busy though.

04:51.177 --> 04:53.676
- How's the commodore doing?
- Nucky.

04:53.678 --> 04:56.926
Nucky my ass. When were you planning
to tell me about the stroke?

04:56.956 --> 04:59.955
- There's a doctor-patient privilege.
- Really?

05:00.009 --> 05:02.570
Well, you know
what's another privilege?

05:02.572 --> 05:05.764
The ability to sell
medicinal alcohol.

05:05.798 --> 05:07.532
That license I got you,

05:07.566 --> 05:10.322
the one that puts an extra grand
in your pocket every month?

05:10.324 --> 05:13.976
That's a privilege too, Carl, one
that I could very easily take away.

05:13.978 --> 05:16.045
Nucky, I... I'm sorry.

05:16.130 --> 05:17.921
<i>Yeah well, next time...</i>

05:17.955 --> 05:19.654
I was wondering, doctor,

05:19.688 --> 05:21.889
when you're done, if you'd
mind checking on Emily.

05:22.047 --> 05:25.002
- What's wrong?
- She's warm, no appetite.

05:25.146 --> 05:27.034
Of course.

05:30.977 --> 05:33.981
Don't forget who
your friends are, Carl.

05:34.025 --> 05:35.870
I'll see you next week.

05:48.576 --> 05:51.707
<i>Trying my patience.</i>

05:51.744 --> 05:53.890
That's enough now.

05:55.846 --> 05:58.615
Come. Come.

05:58.617 --> 06:00.666
Dad, there's some man
here to see you.

06:00.701 --> 06:04.222
- What does he want?
- Sheriff Thompson?

06:05.461 --> 06:07.562
- Yes?
- Who the hell are you?

06:07.608 --> 06:08.628
My name is Dick Halsey.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.579
I'm a clerk with Esther
Randolph's office.

06:10.613 --> 06:12.906
<i>- Who?
- The assistant U.S. attorney?</i>

06:12.931 --> 06:15.147
- Right. Sure.
- What's the matter?

06:15.168 --> 06:17.523
It's okay, pop.
What can I do for you?

06:17.573 --> 06:19.683
Left several messages
with your office.

06:19.718 --> 06:20.491
Tourist season.

06:20.492 --> 06:22.705
We got crowds of people
with conventions.

06:22.748 --> 06:24.484
Sheriff Thompson,
this is a subpoena

06:24.486 --> 06:27.680
calling for your testimony pursuant
to an ongoing investigation.

06:27.701 --> 06:30.507
- It's a subpoena?
- What kind of horseshit is this?

06:30.541 --> 06:32.619
- Dad?
- You come to my goddamn house?!

06:32.653 --> 06:35.335
- You son of a bitch!
- We could have arrested you, sir.

06:35.374 --> 06:37.132
The subpoena is
a professional courtesy.

06:37.166 --> 06:39.763
- Get the hell out of here!
- What do you want with my son?!

06:39.801 --> 06:41.798
- Hey!
- Grandpa!

06:41.832 --> 06:43.887
Oh dear God.

06:43.946 --> 06:45.936
<i>- Eli!
- Dad!</i>

06:48.476 --> 06:50.557
<i>Dad.</i>

06:50.662 --> 06:53.060
Angela, pick up the phone!

06:53.068 --> 06:55.451
Jesus.
Are you here?!

06:55.502 --> 06:57.783
God damn it!

06:59.395 --> 07:01.869
- Hello.
- Princeton, it's me.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.133
<i>Finally, Jesus.</i>

07:03.167 --> 07:05.823
Why've you been ducking me?

07:05.857 --> 07:08.707
I don't owe you money and I sure
as shit ain't scared of you,

07:08.711 --> 07:10.436
so why the hell
would I be duckin' you?

07:10.438 --> 07:13.316
Four messages until you ring me
back... what do you call that?

07:13.318 --> 07:14.879
Busy.
So what do you want?

07:14.898 --> 07:16.264
<i>An explanation.</i>

07:16.298 --> 07:18.400
Your friend from Chicago's
in the fucking morgue!

07:18.434 --> 07:21.548
<i>- God rest his soul.
- That's all you've got to say?</i>

07:21.550 --> 07:23.134
I ain't much
on eulogies, pal.

07:23.257 --> 07:25.480
Knock off the jokes, Al.

07:25.508 --> 07:27.772
He was supposed
to do a job.

07:27.819 --> 07:30.436
Which is somethin' you shoulda
did months ago, like I told you.

07:30.438 --> 07:32.599
That's not the point!
You vouched for this fella

07:32.716 --> 07:34.079
and now Nucky's still alive?

07:34.080 --> 07:35.579
<i>Oh, you pointin' fingers now?</i>

07:35.775 --> 07:37.783
<i>That shows a real lack
of character, buddy.</i>

07:37.846 --> 07:39.683
- What the fuck am I supposed...
- Jimmy!

07:39.773 --> 07:41.759
<i>Who's that?</i>

07:41.771 --> 07:44.019
<i>Princeton?</i>

07:44.054 --> 07:46.156
How long you been
standing there?

07:46.289 --> 07:46.970
How's that?

07:46.971 --> 07:49.172
Long enough.
We're going to the beach.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.585
<i>- Ange!
- The fuck you say?</i>

07:53.092 --> 07:54.791
<i>- Al.
- What's going on?</i>

07:54.852 --> 07:57.073
Look, I gotta go.

08:01.745 --> 08:02.867
Fuck!

08:02.869 --> 08:05.754
- Who was that?
- Darmody,

08:05.770 --> 08:08.644
- Atlantic City.
- What did he want?

08:08.689 --> 08:10.605
Nothing.
I don't know.

08:10.651 --> 08:12.767
It's pandemonium
over there.

08:12.769 --> 08:15.580
Hmm. I got a meeting with Remus.

08:15.614 --> 08:19.438
There's a shipment comin' in.
Romulus couldn't make it.

08:19.490 --> 08:21.708
Is that his partner?

08:25.878 --> 08:28.073
Let me give you
some advice:

08:28.107 --> 08:30.239
I don't know what's goin' on
with you and Darmody...

08:30.273 --> 08:33.618
- John, you got it wrong...
- ...And I don't really give a shit.

08:33.655 --> 08:37.230
But whatever it is you're doin',
I'll tell you one thing...

08:37.264 --> 08:41.471
Keep me out of it
and don't be fuckin' stupid.

08:43.214 --> 08:45.437
George, how are you?

08:54.377 --> 08:56.687
99.8.

08:56.810 --> 09:00.894
Call me if it spikes, but I
highly doubt that it will.

09:02.366 --> 09:04.120
Something she ate
perhaps?

09:04.154 --> 09:07.034
She ran herself ragged
at the lake on Sunday.

09:07.036 --> 09:09.820
There's a bug going around.
Nothing to worry about.

09:15.838 --> 09:17.852
Get the car.

09:18.652 --> 09:20.370
Katy.

09:20.405 --> 09:21.984
Ma'am.

09:29.541 --> 09:31.680
Is he taking
his meals here now?

09:31.714 --> 09:34.062
It was just
coffee, ma'am.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.649
Take the children
to Lilian, please.

09:36.683 --> 09:39.937
Come on now.
Off with you both.

09:45.362 --> 09:47.788
Damn it.

09:49.348 --> 09:52.944
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting with my attorney.

09:53.047 --> 09:55.232
Can't he come here?

09:55.234 --> 09:57.156
It's with the federal
prosecutor.

09:57.300 --> 10:00.577
I don't like
you going out.

10:00.612 --> 10:03.199
Owen won't
leave my side.

10:04.862 --> 10:08.003
If you're worried, I'll call Eddie
instead and Owen can stay here.

10:08.005 --> 10:11.058
That won't
be necessary.

10:12.607 --> 10:14.962
Can I make you
some breakfast?

10:15.060 --> 10:17.452
No thanks, I'll eat
something at the office.

10:23.466 --> 10:26.666
Hello? Yes.

10:33.462 --> 10:36.252
I'm very sorry.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.018
That was June,
your brother's wife.

10:52.890 --> 10:54.956
Your father has died.

11:01.338 --> 11:03.806
Okay.

11:13.504 --> 11:15.329
I'll...

11:15.331 --> 11:17.744
I'll eat something
at the office.

11:40.183 --> 11:41.868
Come in.

11:42.067 --> 11:44.308
- Ingrid, is it?
- Sigrid.

11:44.431 --> 11:46.128
Oh.

11:46.162 --> 11:47.570
I'll take that.

11:47.571 --> 11:48.977
Oh, this must be...

11:49.004 --> 11:51.265
Your room is the first
one off the hall,

11:51.267 --> 11:54.221
where you will also
sleep with the child.

11:54.324 --> 11:57.523
- I'm sure it's quite serviceable.
- The kitchen.

11:57.698 --> 12:00.877
The water closet
is in back.

12:00.931 --> 12:03.047
A Victrola for music...

12:03.080 --> 12:05.715
A VV-80,
the latest model.

12:05.749 --> 12:09.796
Very nice.
I love to sing songs.

12:12.138 --> 12:14.375
Do you have
any questions?

12:14.606 --> 12:16.879
What is
to be the salary?

12:16.913 --> 12:20.402
Room and board,
meals provided,

12:20.631 --> 12:23.709
with an additional
$18 per month.

12:23.748 --> 12:26.522
<i>Ja, that is suitable.</i>

12:26.547 --> 12:28.701
You do understand

12:28.856 --> 12:30.525
it is seven days a week?

12:30.559 --> 12:34.582
I must require
some time to myself.

12:36.019 --> 12:38.916
Sundays, once a month.

12:38.918 --> 12:43.182
But all of the child's meals
will be prepared in advance.

12:43.216 --> 12:46.054
<i>Ja ja, I'm excellent cook.</i>

12:46.243 --> 12:49.295
I prepare for you
some fish stew.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.493
<i>- That won't be necessary.
- Very well.</i>

12:51.527 --> 12:53.715
You'll find everything
you need in the cupboard.

12:55.055 --> 12:57.052
<i>Her name is what?</i>

12:57.091 --> 12:59.811
<i>- The baby?
- Abigail.</i>

13:11.653 --> 13:14.614
Do you not wish
to kiss her goodbye?

13:27.413 --> 13:29.922
Sweet little Abigail,

13:29.959 --> 13:33.016
how your papa loves you.

13:41.599 --> 13:44.269
Good work, boy.
Good work.

13:44.318 --> 13:48.268
If we maintain those odds

13:48.388 --> 13:49.942
and he's a late entry?

13:49.978 --> 13:53.045
It's unorthodox yes, but there's
nothing illegal about it.

13:53.077 --> 13:55.646
Said the spider
to the fly.

13:55.669 --> 13:59.168
You've been known to spin
webs yourself, my friend.

13:59.216 --> 14:01.862
- A.R.
- Charlie, Meyer.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.879
- Say hello to Max Hirsch.
- Hey, guys.

14:03.921 --> 14:06.073
- Nice to make your acquaintance.
- A pleasure.

14:06.107 --> 14:08.844
<i>Max trains Sidereal.</i>

14:08.878 --> 14:11.084
He's running at Aqueduct
on the fourth of July.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.126
Not yet,
he ain't.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.961
We'll continue to talk,
can we agree on that?

14:16.013 --> 14:18.618
You'll talk,
I'll listen.

14:21.087 --> 14:23.091
How are you boys
making out?

14:23.125 --> 14:25.647
Not so great, but it's nice
to get out in the sun.

14:25.694 --> 14:29.094
There are cheaper ways to get
a tan than picking losers.

14:29.128 --> 14:32.641
You're tellin' me.
My last horse is still runnin'.

14:32.763 --> 14:36.103
And what's the word
from Philadelphia?

14:38.112 --> 14:40.661
Business as usual,
near as I can tell.

14:40.663 --> 14:43.452
There's a shipment on
Thursday from Bill McCoy.

14:43.486 --> 14:47.198
Nucky Thompson's still alive,
so until we hear otherwise...

14:50.490 --> 14:52.683
Any idea
what happened there?

14:54.392 --> 14:56.259
With Thompson?

14:56.295 --> 14:57.798
Who knows?

14:57.832 --> 14:59.262
Word is he's got a
beef with his brother.

14:59.263 --> 15:00.691
Really?

15:00.888 --> 15:04.180
I would have thought
James Darmody myself.

15:05.674 --> 15:08.616
Nah, Darmody ain't
got it in him.

15:10.485 --> 15:12.580
Pillow talk, Charlie?

15:12.697 --> 15:15.694
With the mother?
I'm through with that.

15:20.284 --> 15:22.092
What's the matter?

15:22.140 --> 15:24.169
Manure.

15:25.099 --> 15:26.584
But what can you expect

15:26.586 --> 15:28.999
when you conduct
your business in a stable?

15:37.721 --> 15:42.304
Tax evasion, bid-rigging,
embezzlement of county funds,

15:42.339 --> 15:44.880
graft, gambling,
prostitution,

15:44.882 --> 15:48.424
<i>various and sundry
Volstead Act violations.</i>

15:48.487 --> 15:49.799
What, no fare-beating?

15:49.800 --> 15:51.930
We can amend the
complaint further.

15:51.996 --> 15:55.290
You're like an onion, Mr. Thompson.
The more layers we peel...

15:55.314 --> 15:58.169
I prefer to think
of myself as an artichoke.

15:58.171 --> 16:00.504
And for the record,
those charges are baseless.

16:00.506 --> 16:03.528
There is no record.
This is an informal conversation.

16:03.689 --> 16:05.414
Well, if you're
nudging this chat

16:05.576 --> 16:07.133
in the direction
of a plea deal...

16:07.341 --> 16:10.261
You can save your breath.
I'm innocent, counselor...

16:10.263 --> 16:13.137
Completely
and unequivocally.

16:15.478 --> 16:17.244
Shall we discuss
your shooting?

16:17.292 --> 16:19.309
I can think of more
pleasant topics.

16:19.423 --> 16:21.499
You're not curious
who'd want you dead?

16:21.606 --> 16:22.769
I'm curious who shot me.

16:22.770 --> 16:25.143
Listing who'd want me
dead would take too long.

16:25.205 --> 16:27.850
Do you know
a John Torrio of Chicago?

16:27.906 --> 16:30.180
- No.
- Yes you do.

16:30.182 --> 16:32.150
Then why did you ask?

16:32.152 --> 16:35.027
The shooter's name
was Vito Scalercio.

16:35.029 --> 16:37.756
He lived in a building
leased by Torrio's associate,

16:37.783 --> 16:39.023
an Alphonse Capone.

16:39.024 --> 16:41.917
Those closest to you,
your so-called friends?

16:41.951 --> 16:44.136
Apparently they're trying
to kill you, Mr. Thompson.

16:44.374 --> 16:46.944
<i>- So go after them.
- I intend to...</i>

16:46.946 --> 16:49.044
The sheriff,
your various aldermen.

16:49.046 --> 16:51.669
Some of whom we've already
subpoenaed for questioning.

16:51.671 --> 16:54.158
I'm entitled to see
those transcripts.

16:54.193 --> 16:57.270
Of course you are.
Some fascinating reading.

16:57.304 --> 16:59.514
Mrs. Schroeder... your...?

16:59.548 --> 17:01.477
Companion.

17:01.512 --> 17:05.287
Yes. How did
you two come to meet?

17:08.832 --> 17:12.412
There you go again, asking questions
you already know the answers to.

17:12.445 --> 17:13.984
I might not know
as much as you think.

17:14.143 --> 17:16.766
You want me to do
your job for you?

17:22.651 --> 17:25.800
I do have ways
of showing gratitude.

17:28.021 --> 17:31.458
Speaking of which, it was Mr. Lathrop
here who saved your life.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.970
I believe a thank you
would have been in order.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.995
Would you stop moving around?

17:47.007 --> 17:49.172
Steady steady.

17:50.273 --> 17:52.640
Thank you!

17:52.674 --> 17:54.498
Ahh ahh!

17:54.525 --> 17:56.133
<i>Watch out! Hold on.</i>

17:56.167 --> 17:58.968
<i>Can we get down now?</i>

18:18.877 --> 18:21.299
- Pull it down, sister.
- Beg your pardon?

18:21.328 --> 18:24.161
- Your skirt's too short.
- Too short for what?

18:24.195 --> 18:26.846
It's the law, lady.
The bottom of the skirt

18:26.880 --> 18:29.873
shall be no higher than
seven inches above the knee.

18:29.897 --> 18:32.809
- They actually measure.
- What kind of town is this?

18:32.843 --> 18:35.189
I'll write you a summons
and you can find out.

18:35.223 --> 18:37.846
Swell.
Make it out to Molly Fletcher.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.076
I take it you're not
from around here?

18:40.115 --> 18:42.489
San Francisco.
New in town.

18:42.524 --> 18:45.520
Not much of a welcome, is it?

18:45.554 --> 18:47.315
- $10.
- What?!

18:47.353 --> 18:48.998
I don't have
that kind of money.

18:49.030 --> 18:51.503
Fine, then you can spend
the night in jail.

18:54.390 --> 18:56.361
Come on, you have got
to be kidding me.

18:56.395 --> 18:58.341
Nice.

18:58.366 --> 19:00.713
You're attracting
the beach lizards now.

19:00.747 --> 19:04.689
Oh, let 'em gawk.
They're called knees, fellas.

19:04.691 --> 19:05.908
What's the trouble?

19:05.909 --> 19:09.097
She refuses to cover up
and she won't pay the fine.

19:09.143 --> 19:12.766
<i>- You really want to go to jail?
- Sure, I'm a public menace.</i>

19:12.797 --> 19:16.898
Officer, I'm sorry.
My cousin is a joker.

19:16.932 --> 19:20.277
If you'll let me pay the fine, I'll
be sure to keep her out of trouble.

19:20.279 --> 19:22.890
Gee.
You'd do that, cuz?

19:24.597 --> 19:27.772
- That all right with you?
- Suit yourself.

19:29.694 --> 19:31.920
And cover her up.

19:36.203 --> 19:39.073
<i>- Hey... aw no!
- Come on.</i>

19:39.107 --> 19:42.123
Sit, dear.

19:47.884 --> 19:50.191
Well, what'd you
do that for?

19:50.193 --> 19:52.696
- Angela.
- Louise.

19:52.698 --> 19:54.393
Not Molly?

19:54.431 --> 19:58.086
Molly Fletcher's a character
in a novel I'm writing.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.729
Huh.

20:01.004 --> 20:03.793
- Apple cheeks belong to you?
- My son.

20:03.795 --> 20:07.153
- Tommy, say hello to Louise.
- Hi.

20:07.155 --> 20:09.303
Hiya there.

20:09.322 --> 20:12.919
- So you're a novelist?
- I am.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.483
And what do you do

20:15.502 --> 20:18.320
when you're not
squeezing out cherubs?

20:20.443 --> 20:22.942
I'm still trying
to decide.

20:30.136 --> 20:32.511
So now it's my fault?

20:32.609 --> 20:35.202
Success has
many fathers, dear.

20:35.236 --> 20:37.722
Failure is an orphan.

20:40.445 --> 20:42.616
Munya.

20:42.828 --> 20:45.006
Welcome.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.352
There's the boychik.

20:47.386 --> 20:50.735
- Your lovely wife?
- His mother, actually.

20:50.737 --> 20:54.041
- But thank you.
- Well, such a maiden.

20:55.250 --> 20:58.015
James was right.
You're quite the charmer.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.373
Oh, he's a good boy.

20:59.407 --> 21:02.844
Well, I'll leave you two
gentlemen to your business.

21:09.859 --> 21:11.591
L'Chaim.

21:11.643 --> 21:13.546
To the lost.

21:14.645 --> 21:16.037
Hmm.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.179
So?

21:27.355 --> 21:29.047
Nucky Thompson...

21:29.081 --> 21:31.597
<i>Such news I should
read in the paper?</i>

21:31.612 --> 21:33.875
That's where I read it.

21:36.113 --> 21:39.525
Must we pretend with each
other like children?

21:39.559 --> 21:43.780
Why not? You don't miss a
chance to refer to me as a boy.

21:43.814 --> 21:47.122
Because a man honors
his commitments.

21:47.201 --> 21:50.320
I paid you $5,000
for alcohol

21:50.322 --> 21:54.019
- that I never received.
- I don't have it yet.

21:56.185 --> 21:57.632
With a house

21:57.667 --> 21:59.280
such as this?

21:59.314 --> 22:01.653
My father's,
not mine.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.642
Hmm.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.017
A man once,

22:15.175 --> 22:17.722
he comes to my shop
with a deer,

22:17.724 --> 22:21.338
wants me to cut off
the head for $7.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.813
So I offer to butcher
the animal...

22:24.847 --> 22:27.907
Venison steak, sausage,

22:27.909 --> 22:30.222
rump roast.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.544
Deers are kosher?

22:32.586 --> 22:34.746
<i>I ask on account
of Santy Claus...</i>

22:34.917 --> 22:36.868
With the reindeers.

22:36.870 --> 22:40.628
<i>This man, this farshtinkener
piece of shit,</i>

22:40.761 --> 22:43.657
he's not interested
in the meat.

22:43.810 --> 22:47.563
So I ask him how he come
to kill this deer.

22:47.630 --> 22:50.692
And he tells me that
his friend does the shootin',

22:50.726 --> 22:54.577
<i>so that he can have the trophy,</i>

22:54.579 --> 22:58.470
a head to hang
on his wall.

22:58.512 --> 23:01.971
For this alone you kill?

23:02.005 --> 23:04.491
To brag to your friends

23:04.525 --> 23:07.475
how you've slain
this beautiful animal?

23:07.696 --> 23:11.554
I've eaten venison, if that's
what you're wondering.

23:13.358 --> 23:15.769
I can see that, boychik.

23:17.233 --> 23:20.273
And that you hid behind papa
when he pulled the trigger.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.986
<i>¶ day after day</i>

23:26.130 --> 23:31.288
<i>¶ in the fields
of yellow corn</i>

23:31.319 --> 23:36.014
<i>¶ no place on earth...</i>

23:36.016 --> 23:38.046
She's asleep.

23:39.857 --> 23:45.394
<i>¶ Than old Virginny</i>

23:45.428 --> 23:51.185
<i>¶ the state where
I was born...</i>

23:51.219 --> 23:53.644
I'm sorry
about your father.

23:56.050 --> 23:57.743
People die.

23:58.942 --> 24:01.147
Is that all you'll say?

24:02.231 --> 24:03.968
What would you prefer?

24:03.970 --> 24:06.313
It's not that.
It's just...

24:06.436 --> 24:08.806
I pretend all day, Margaret.

24:08.902 --> 24:11.727
Must I pretend
with you too?

24:11.729 --> 24:13.908
No.

24:15.696 --> 24:18.942
So what's
to become of us?

24:18.977 --> 24:21.863
Your meeting
with the prosecutor?

24:23.861 --> 24:26.109
She knows about you,

24:26.111 --> 24:28.605
about us...

24:29.829 --> 24:33.481
My various other dealings.

24:36.325 --> 24:38.692
Will you be going
to jail then?

24:38.726 --> 24:41.623
I don't know.

24:41.625 --> 24:44.268
Will I?

24:46.600 --> 24:48.998
Of course not.
Don't be silly.

24:49.031 --> 24:51.602
You've done nothing
wrong, Margaret.

24:51.636 --> 24:54.283
I'll let nothing
happen to you.

24:54.397 --> 24:56.802
Those are
two different things.

24:57.885 --> 24:59.644
Is it worth it,
all this?

24:59.845 --> 25:03.349
How long can you push your
luck before you're killed?

25:03.383 --> 25:05.613
So I should bow down
to these greedy bastards

25:05.647 --> 25:07.695
just because
they want what I have?

25:07.762 --> 25:11.346
At the cost of your life, is it
not greed to fight to keep it?

25:13.608 --> 25:16.634
You're alive.
We have each other.

25:16.636 --> 25:21.689
Don't you ever feel as though
God's giving us a sign?

25:24.317 --> 25:26.773
There's a joke:

25:26.852 --> 25:29.923
A man's drowning,
prays to God for help.

25:29.953 --> 25:33.497
A lifeguard swims out.
The drowning man says,

25:33.531 --> 25:36.844
"no thanks.
God will save me."

25:36.923 --> 25:40.321
A few minutes later
a rowboat comes by.

25:40.323 --> 25:44.777
"No thanks. God will save me.
" Then a steamship.

25:44.811 --> 25:47.357
"No thanks,
God will save me."

25:47.430 --> 25:50.306
Finally the fella drowns,
goes to heaven,

25:50.340 --> 25:52.815
says "God, why didn't
you save me?"

25:52.849 --> 25:55.873
God says, for cryin' out loud, I
sent you two boats and a lifeguard.

25:55.908 --> 25:58.639
What the hell
did you expect?

26:02.242 --> 26:04.678
Not even a smile?

26:04.680 --> 26:08.393
I'd be more amused if I
knew you weren't worried.

26:14.517 --> 26:17.280
I'll get through this,
Margaret, you'll see.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.773
We both will.

27:05.241 --> 27:08.515
- You're smoking now?
- Now?

27:08.686 --> 27:11.821
Meaning you didn't
smoke before.

27:27.645 --> 27:30.249
Why'd you
marry me, Jimmy?

27:36.854 --> 27:39.011
Because I love you.

27:41.983 --> 27:44.765
Is that what
you tell yourself?

27:50.081 --> 27:52.411
It's what
I just told you.

27:52.445 --> 27:55.967
But it isn't true.

28:03.410 --> 28:06.139
I could ask you
the same question.

28:11.144 --> 28:13.896
Because we have
a child together;

28:13.955 --> 28:16.783
<i>it's what society
expected from me;</i>

28:17.034 --> 28:20.362
because you kept
pushing it.

28:22.311 --> 28:24.635
Huh.

28:29.779 --> 28:32.574
That's romantic.

28:32.621 --> 28:34.875
It's honest, Jimmy.

28:34.911 --> 28:37.091
All I'm asking is
the same of you.

28:37.093 --> 28:39.991
I haven't lied
to you, Angela.

28:39.993 --> 28:42.441
You haven't told me
anything.

28:45.178 --> 28:48.278
You go out,
I don't know where.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.487
You come home all hours,

28:50.489 --> 28:53.636
sometimes days later,
with blood on your clothes.

28:53.670 --> 28:55.953
God knows where you've been,

28:55.987 --> 28:58.644
- what you're doing.
- Selling booze.

29:03.047 --> 29:05.672
So what?

29:09.168 --> 29:12.024
Did you try to have
Nucky Thompson killed?

29:16.272 --> 29:18.989
Yes.

29:22.384 --> 29:25.884
<i>I didn't want to, but I did.</i>

29:31.267 --> 29:34.058
Why would you do
such a thing?

29:34.060 --> 29:36.505
<i>The plan was for him
to go to jail.</i>

29:36.539 --> 29:40.476
My father and Eli
approached me last fall.

29:40.478 --> 29:42.668
Nucky would go away

29:42.764 --> 29:45.022
and we would
take over.

29:45.056 --> 29:49.530
- You used to love him.
- He's not what he seems, Ange.

29:52.052 --> 29:54.796
It's complicated.

29:54.830 --> 29:57.655
<i>It wasn't supposed
to be like this.</i>

29:57.698 --> 30:00.778
I kept drawing lines
for myself in the sand,

30:00.842 --> 30:03.640
got further and further
involved and then...

30:03.686 --> 30:06.085
You didn't
want him killed,

30:06.087 --> 30:09.852
yet you went along
with it anyway?

30:09.888 --> 30:12.081
Yes.

30:13.628 --> 30:15.769
<i>What changed your mind?</i>

30:18.484 --> 30:21.277
My mother.

30:40.563 --> 30:43.306
Thank you
for talking to me.

31:02.218 --> 31:04.898
<i>- Hut hut hut hut...
- Company...</i>

31:16.979 --> 31:19.410
Mr. Thompson.
Your guests are inside.

31:19.441 --> 31:21.446
Fine.
I need a favor.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.908
In three minutes or so, the feds are
gonna show up here looking for me.

31:24.954 --> 31:27.120
- I'm being tailed.
- Okay.

31:27.297 --> 31:30.886
You tell 'em I was here,
but then I left with Eddie.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.166
Sure thing.

31:34.358 --> 31:37.306
<i>- We expecting an attack?
- They're surplus...</i>

31:37.340 --> 31:39.179
Made for the war.

31:39.180 --> 31:41.017
I've got 3,000 of 'em
down the cellar.

31:41.019 --> 31:43.302
Who knew your Kaiser'd
chicken out so soon?

31:45.892 --> 31:48.200
Asshole.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.057
<i>- Nucky.
- Mr. Thompson.</i>

31:58.115 --> 32:01.709
Thank you for coming.
I apologize for the accommodations.

32:01.743 --> 32:03.690
Better we
do this in private.

32:03.691 --> 32:05.636
How can we help, Nuck?

32:05.638 --> 32:08.733
You can start by getting the
pissants who work for you in line.

32:09.841 --> 32:11.048
Vito Scalercio?

32:11.083 --> 32:14.419
- Never heard of him.
- Well, he shot me, John.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.069
And before the feds
shot him,

32:16.070 --> 32:17.772
he was living in a building
leased by your boy.

32:17.897 --> 32:20.774
- What?
- Al Capone.

32:22.067 --> 32:24.497
<i>I knew somethin' was up.</i>

32:24.540 --> 32:27.226
The little prick's been talkin'
to your Jimmy Darmody.

32:27.282 --> 32:30.368
- And he came to see me months ago.
- Al did?

32:30.402 --> 32:33.051
No, Mr. Darmody,

32:33.063 --> 32:35.077
offering to
sell me liquor.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.566
Now you're telling me this?

32:36.567 --> 32:38.413
The day after you
were arrested.

32:38.447 --> 32:41.019
In any case,
I turned him down.

32:41.053 --> 32:42.917
And Luciano?

32:42.951 --> 32:44.494
Lansky?
Can you vouch for them?

32:44.720 --> 32:46.419
That they're not in
cahoots with Darmody?

32:46.420 --> 32:48.118
No, I can't.

32:48.153 --> 32:50.801
<i>But I can tell you one
of Waxey Gordon's men</i>

32:50.997 --> 32:53.647
<i>was killed making
your delivery last month.</i>

32:53.681 --> 32:57.431
A failed hijacking,
I was told.

32:59.320 --> 33:02.207
The pups have grown fangs,
gentlemen.

33:02.209 --> 33:04.720
What are you
gonna do?

33:04.774 --> 33:06.817
- What would you do, John?
- Kill the prick.

33:06.886 --> 33:09.909
I'm under indictment.
The feds are up my ass.

33:09.954 --> 33:12.215
Then take a plea.
Retire somewhere.

33:12.217 --> 33:15.540
With what? All my money's
tied up with the land deal.

33:17.534 --> 33:19.409
Do nothing.

33:20.938 --> 33:24.687
- I beg your pardon?
- You have no move, Mr. Thompson.

33:24.718 --> 33:27.610
- You do nothing.
- He's under attack, Arnold.

33:27.612 --> 33:30.350
All the more reason
for patience.

33:32.212 --> 33:36.497
I've made my living, Mr.
Thompson, in large part as a gambler.

33:37.871 --> 33:40.766
Some days I make 20 bets,

33:40.768 --> 33:43.381
some days I make none.

33:43.518 --> 33:46.399
<i>There are weeks,
sometimes months in fact,</i>

33:46.401 --> 33:49.939
when I don't make a bet at all
because there simply is no play.

33:51.508 --> 33:54.256
So I wait, plan,

33:54.258 --> 33:57.389
<i>marshal my resources.</i>

33:57.391 --> 34:00.250
And when I finally
see an opportunity

34:00.284 --> 34:02.920
and there is
a bet to make,

34:04.973 --> 34:07.294
I bet it all.

34:17.547 --> 34:20.922
Step right up, friends.
Meet Patricia Patrick,

34:20.958 --> 34:23.795
half-man, half-woman!

34:23.849 --> 34:26.795
Is it a he or is it a she?

34:26.842 --> 34:29.248
<i>- Jesus!
- Don't get her sore</i>

34:29.264 --> 34:30.963
or he'll bust you
in the nose!

34:32.632 --> 34:36.187
And I would like
a club sandwich, please.

34:42.574 --> 34:45.643
A buddy of mine
would eat tongue.

34:45.646 --> 34:48.442
- I'll take the check, please.
- It's on the arm.

34:48.648 --> 34:51.451
- Beg your pardon?
- Policemen eat free.

34:51.455 --> 34:54.402
We're federal agents and
that's against regulations.

35:00.626 --> 35:03.809
- That's right.
- Just being neighborly.

35:17.475 --> 35:20.322
<i>Malum in se.</i>

35:20.363 --> 35:22.667
- Sir?
- It's Latin.

35:22.701 --> 35:26.166
It means evil
in and of itself.

35:26.206 --> 35:28.665
- Like murder.
- Precisely.

35:28.699 --> 35:31.415
<i>Whereas "malum prohibitum"</i>

35:31.458 --> 35:33.867
is a wrong dictated
by statute.

35:35.151 --> 35:37.826
Us accepting
a free lunch.

35:37.865 --> 35:40.089
Correct.

35:40.131 --> 35:42.933
Or people
selling whiskey.

35:45.192 --> 35:46.995
You might say that.

35:47.013 --> 35:49.977
I might.
And what might you say?

35:55.668 --> 35:59.103
- Can I speak freely?
- I'd expect nothing less.

36:03.557 --> 36:05.446
When I first
joined the bureau,

36:05.480 --> 36:08.450
I was convinced what
we were doing was right.

36:08.486 --> 36:10.870
But after a while,

36:10.894 --> 36:14.782
seeing how it's harder and
harder to enforce the law...

36:17.959 --> 36:20.376
We should be going.

36:25.965 --> 36:29.263
<i>¶ in the town
of Louisville</i>

36:29.466 --> 36:32.332
<i>¶ they got a man
called big bad bill.</i>

36:32.366 --> 36:35.420
What is this place?

36:35.472 --> 36:37.735
Just a house.
Come on.

36:38.888 --> 36:41.541
<i>¶ He had folks
all scared to death</i>

36:41.565 --> 36:44.557
<i>¶ when he walked by
they held their breath</i>

36:44.561 --> 36:48.111
<i>¶ he was a fighting man,
sure enough...</i>

36:48.164 --> 36:51.516
Excuse me.
I wanna just get this.

36:53.363 --> 36:56.031
<i>¶ now he's
a different guy...</i>

36:56.065 --> 36:59.573
- Do you know these people?
- They're performers mostly.

36:59.584 --> 37:02.902
- Locals.
- I thought you just moved here.

37:02.924 --> 37:07.626
I did. My friend Arthur
is around here somewhere.

37:12.715 --> 37:16.259
One party last month, a fella
made a giant sand sculpture...

37:16.308 --> 37:18.854
Jesus on the cross
with two heads.

37:18.878 --> 37:22.714
- Why two heads?
- Not everything has to make sense.

37:24.522 --> 37:28.157
Mmm, did you dream
about me last night?

37:28.202 --> 37:30.730
I dreamt about
a purple snake.

37:30.732 --> 37:32.674
I chopped it up
with a hatchet.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.869
The pieces turned into horses
and I rode one away.

37:35.897 --> 37:38.703
That was about
my penis.

37:38.745 --> 37:41.654
Isn't everything?
Say hello to Angela.

37:41.712 --> 37:44.408
- Arthur's a hoofer.
- Shall we dance, my dear?

37:44.442 --> 37:46.959
- Maybe later.
- No cutting in, bub.

37:46.992 --> 37:49.506
Hmmm.

37:53.452 --> 37:57.175
It's okay, cookie.
We're invisible here.

38:00.438 --> 38:04.314
<i>¶ To my honey
I'll croon love's tune</i>

38:07.139 --> 38:09.645
¶ keep a-shining
in June

38:09.680 --> 38:13.447
¶ your silvery beams
will bring love dreams

38:13.481 --> 38:16.670
¶ we'll be cuddling soon.

38:36.785 --> 38:40.997
<i>Four... two, three, four.</i>

38:41.031 --> 38:44.315
"Stormy seas...
Go back three days."

38:44.349 --> 38:46.618
Oh well.

38:46.652 --> 38:49.657
It's your turn,
sweetheart.

38:52.178 --> 38:54.048
One.

38:54.050 --> 38:56.554
Southampton.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.775
- Where's that?
- England.

38:58.777 --> 39:01.220
It's where you make the big
trip across the ocean.

39:01.222 --> 39:04.763
- Did you go there, mama?
- I did, dear.

39:04.797 --> 39:08.477
<i>That's where my boat left from
when I came over from Ireland.</i>

39:08.515 --> 39:11.007
I'm gonna
do that too.

39:11.041 --> 39:14.254
<i>Sail a big ship like sinbad
straight over the waves.</i>

39:14.391 --> 39:17.025
<i>Mind you don't
get seasick now.</i>

39:17.059 --> 39:20.544
I won't.

39:20.581 --> 39:23.732
<i>Your turn, uncle Nucky.</i>

39:26.443 --> 39:28.439
<i>Uncle Nucky?</i>

39:33.938 --> 39:36.654
I'd like you to start
calling me dad.

39:39.208 --> 39:42.208
Would you
like that, Teddy?

39:42.397 --> 39:44.374
Yes.

39:46.216 --> 39:49.051
And you too, kiddo.

39:52.078 --> 39:55.576
It's your move, dad.

39:55.619 --> 39:58.617
Yes, it is.

40:17.560 --> 40:20.113
Nucky.

40:24.843 --> 40:26.992
What are you doing here?

40:26.993 --> 40:29.141
I have as much right
to be here as you do.

40:30.357 --> 40:33.609
I'm surprised
is all.

40:33.643 --> 40:36.305
That it's not me
in the box?

40:38.042 --> 40:40.777
I had nothing
to do with that.

40:42.041 --> 40:45.017
You had nothing to do
with stopping it either.

40:58.496 --> 41:00.501
They came for me,

41:01.705 --> 41:03.725
<i>the feds.</i>

41:03.759 --> 41:09.419
A subpoena, Monday,
at the house.

41:12.793 --> 41:15.884
Why didn't you
wake him there?

41:19.873 --> 41:22.641
The kids don't need
to see him like this.

41:29.562 --> 41:32.135
Uncle Clary.

41:34.883 --> 41:37.372
What?

41:37.483 --> 41:39.771
Mom's brother,
uncle Clarence.

41:42.221 --> 41:44.673
He was waked
at aunt Ann's.

41:44.707 --> 41:46.531
They made you kiss him.

41:46.597 --> 41:49.377
<i>- What?
- You were terrified,</i>

41:49.379 --> 41:51.578
couldn't go there for
three christmases

41:51.579 --> 41:53.777
without becoming hysterical.

41:55.500 --> 41:59.066
Huh.

41:59.100 --> 42:02.762
I didn't think
you'd be here this early.

42:04.256 --> 42:07.195
Why I came.

42:10.097 --> 42:12.607
I'm surprised
you'd come at all.

42:12.729 --> 42:15.713
I'm here for mother.

42:15.747 --> 42:17.713
And for Susan.

42:17.758 --> 42:21.205
They're all together now.

42:24.129 --> 42:26.141
Heaven?

42:26.243 --> 42:29.749
Even if it existed,
do you actually think

42:29.751 --> 42:32.102
that son of a bitch
would be there?

42:45.737 --> 42:48.491
Was he that bad, Nucky?

42:50.343 --> 42:52.341
I mean, really?

42:52.491 --> 42:56.458
You've obviously forgotten key
events from our childhood.

42:57.620 --> 42:59.947
I turned out okay.

42:59.949 --> 43:02.631
So did you.

43:05.075 --> 43:08.466
Whatever he did, he made
us the men we are today,

43:08.468 --> 43:10.358
didn't he?

43:10.479 --> 43:11.972
And what's that?

43:12.007 --> 43:15.691
We run
this fucking town, Nucky.

43:17.491 --> 43:20.376
"We" don't run
anything, brother.

43:20.521 --> 43:23.134
And he can rot in hell.

43:25.079 --> 43:27.272
That's you, boy,

43:28.800 --> 43:30.954
in spades.

43:36.027 --> 43:39.022
No capacity
for forgiveness.

43:40.469 --> 43:42.962
Grow up,
brother, please.

43:44.651 --> 43:47.239
And take some
responsibility

43:47.241 --> 43:50.000
at long fucking last.

45:09.047 --> 45:11.572
<i>Still waiting for
delivery on New York Street.</i>

45:11.667 --> 45:13.360
Clifford Lathrop?

45:13.394 --> 45:15.028
Yes?

45:15.062 --> 45:16.722
From Enoch Thompson.

45:20.253 --> 45:23.289
<i>Just got an incoming.
Come on, let's unload it.</i>

45:25.959 --> 45:30.103
"You're a peach.
Thanks for saving my life."

45:39.082 --> 45:41.962
Mr. Thompson.

45:46.027 --> 45:47.957
Thank you
for seeing me.

45:47.959 --> 45:51.083
Of course.
Would you like a drink?

45:51.117 --> 45:53.282
Thank you, no.
I won't be staying.

45:56.350 --> 45:59.160
These past few months have been
difficult, to say the least,

45:59.308 --> 46:02.227
I'm sure for all of us.
Threats were made,

46:02.229 --> 46:04.169
<i>accusations were hurled.</i>

46:04.204 --> 46:07.105
We could continue on
in this manner,

46:07.139 --> 46:08.644
but to do so

46:08.646 --> 46:12.147
would contradict
the point I'm here to make...

46:12.262 --> 46:14.504
That life
is woefully short.

46:14.506 --> 46:16.722
My father passed
on Monday.

46:16.836 --> 46:19.220
You gentlemen
should know that.

46:22.196 --> 46:26.979
I'm sorry...
To hear that.

46:27.064 --> 46:29.152
My condolences.

46:30.008 --> 46:31.506
<i>My father's death</i>

46:31.508 --> 46:34.198
and my recent brush
with the same

46:34.233 --> 46:36.127
got me to thinking.

46:36.161 --> 46:38.676
<i>I don't need this</i>

46:38.707 --> 46:40.845
<i>and I no longer want it.</i>

46:40.880 --> 46:43.857
I have the love
of a fine woman

46:43.891 --> 46:47.672
and the joy of raising
her two wonderful children.

46:48.851 --> 46:50.689
<i>I have money enough
to retire...</i>

46:50.724 --> 46:53.525
<i>At least I will once
I sell some property.</i>

46:53.559 --> 46:57.766
And when my legal troubles are
behind me, I intend to do just that.

47:02.379 --> 47:05.346
You built this town,

47:05.404 --> 47:07.460
<i>now you can have it back...</i>

47:07.488 --> 47:10.647
<i>Atlantic City and all
that goes with it.</i>

47:10.681 --> 47:13.205
I've already spoken
to Mayor Bader

47:13.240 --> 47:16.245
and I've instructed him to give
you his full cooperation.

47:16.423 --> 47:17.992
You're stepping down
as treasurer?

47:18.026 --> 47:20.515
I am.
And you gentlemen have my word

47:20.549 --> 47:22.003
that I will not
stand in your way.

47:22.249 --> 47:25.740
<i>Choose whomever
you'd like as my successor.</i>

47:30.791 --> 47:31.961
Nucky.

47:42.023 --> 47:43.902
Good luck to you.

47:46.028 --> 47:48.319
And to you too, James.

48:59.469 --> 49:01.283
Mr. White has arrived.

49:17.531 --> 49:20.439
- You wanted to see me?
- Chalky.

49:20.473 --> 49:22.688
What are
you drinking?

49:22.748 --> 49:24.971
It's all the same.

49:28.533 --> 49:31.747
- Where yours?
- One thing I'll say for the hand,

49:31.783 --> 49:33.627
it's cut my drinking
down by half.

49:33.661 --> 49:36.988
To the future.

49:37.007 --> 49:41.469
That sound nice,
but I ain't sure I got one.

49:43.516 --> 49:46.598
You'll beat it, Chalky.
Just do as the lawyer says.

49:46.642 --> 49:48.708
It ain't my legal case
I'm talking about.

49:48.709 --> 49:50.773
It's my people.

49:50.807 --> 49:53.806
They losing faith.

49:53.840 --> 49:57.528
Precisely what I wanted
to talk to you about.

49:59.008 --> 50:01.783
You people want justice?
Well, it's time to give it to them.

50:01.812 --> 50:05.644
You telling me to go out
and murder some klan boys?

50:05.678 --> 50:09.536
You're smarter than that.
You have power, Chalky...

50:09.574 --> 50:14.209
Economic power. In your house you
said your people were behind you.

50:14.240 --> 50:18.202
Thousands of black folks that make
this city run... something like that?

50:18.247 --> 50:20.313
- Yeah.
- Then do it,

50:20.347 --> 50:23.284
- call a strike.
- In the middle of tourist season?

50:23.413 --> 50:25.419
It would shut
the city down.

50:25.569 --> 50:27.739
It would cost
a bloody fortune

50:27.769 --> 50:29.438
and you hold
all the cards.

50:31.937 --> 50:34.610
Are you sure this
is what you want?

50:34.611 --> 50:36.510
It doesn't matter to me.

50:36.544 --> 50:39.993
In about 30 minutes
it won't be my problem.

50:42.068 --> 50:43.345
It is time.

50:45.211 --> 50:47.856
Pardon me, Chalky.
I have a press conference.

51:19.087 --> 51:21.419
<i>"In a late-afternoon
press conference</i>

51:21.442 --> 51:24.809
<i>sure to have changed the face of
Atlantic City's political landscape,</i>

51:24.857 --> 51:26.933
<i>beleaguered"...</i>

51:26.952 --> 51:29.205
<i>"County treasurer
Enoch Thompson</i>

51:29.229 --> 51:32.766
stepped down today,
effective immediately."

51:32.784 --> 51:34.747
Beleaguered...

51:34.781 --> 51:37.786
That's French
for completely fucked.

51:38.958 --> 51:41.468
"Citing Thompson's
recent legal troubles,"

51:41.552 --> 51:44.148
Mayor Edward Bader
named James Neary,

51:44.149 --> 51:46.129
alderman of the fourth ward,

51:46.131 --> 51:49.342
"as Thompson's
interim successor."

51:49.384 --> 51:51.180
Congratulations,
Mr. treasurer.

51:51.304 --> 51:53.579
- Well done, boy.
- Thank you.

51:53.581 --> 51:55.814
Drinks are on Jim.

52:10.940 --> 52:13.968
Well, we did it, pal.

52:14.002 --> 52:15.728
<i>It's ours.</i>

52:15.938 --> 52:18.045
Congratulations.

52:18.079 --> 52:21.090
You're a part of this,
are you hearing me?

52:21.124 --> 52:25.183
Everything you ever
wished for is yours.

52:25.216 --> 52:28.606
If wishes were horses,
then beggars would ride.

52:28.638 --> 52:31.190
We're gonna get you a new
suit, get that mask fixed up.

52:31.233 --> 52:32.952
You'll meet a nice gal,
settle down maybe.

52:32.953 --> 52:34.670
I need to talk to you.

52:34.698 --> 52:37.232
There he is!

52:37.234 --> 52:40.007
Let me bow
before the king.

52:40.026 --> 52:42.460
While you're down there,
why don't you kiss my ass?

52:44.528 --> 52:46.944
Munya.
What brings you here?

52:46.992 --> 52:49.873
Me? Miss a celebration?

52:49.908 --> 52:52.019
I need a word.

52:52.031 --> 52:54.066
All right,
in a minute, okay?

52:54.094 --> 52:56.015
Speech! Speech! Speech!

52:56.049 --> 52:58.249
- Speech! Speech!
- Let's hear it.

52:58.290 --> 53:00.346
You want a speech?

53:00.380 --> 53:02.120
All right,
I'll give you a speech.

53:02.227 --> 53:04.720
It wasn't
all that long ago

53:04.754 --> 53:07.882
that most of us
sat in this very room

53:07.920 --> 53:10.564
and listened
to empty promises

53:10.590 --> 53:13.273
made by Nucky Thompson.

53:13.275 --> 53:14.568
- That's right!
- True true.

53:14.570 --> 53:17.544
But as we learned,
talk is cheap.

53:17.559 --> 53:19.628
So's Nucky!

53:19.726 --> 53:21.928
Let me finish, Mickey.

53:22.043 --> 53:25.274
My father,
the commodore,

53:25.276 --> 53:27.165
had a vision:

53:27.167 --> 53:29.358
<i>A kingdom on the ocean</i>

53:29.392 --> 53:33.452
<i>- rising up from the sand.
- Hear hear!</i>

53:34.915 --> 53:37.296
Well, I got
a vision too...

53:37.346 --> 53:40.885
To share that kingdom
with its court.

53:40.919 --> 53:43.759
<i>- Hear!
- It's a new day</i>

53:43.801 --> 53:48.666
and the war is over.
And to the Victors go the spoils!

53:49.759 --> 53:53.580
To prince James.
Long may he reign!

53:53.609 --> 53:55.407
Hear hear.

54:24.480 --> 54:26.623
There's a bulb out
in the kitchen.

54:26.625 --> 54:28.877
I'll have the girl
do it in the morning.

54:31.076 --> 54:33.234
I'm off to bed now.

54:34.144 --> 54:36.587
Not too late.
It's been a busy day.

54:36.698 --> 54:39.110
I'll be up in a while.

54:40.142 --> 54:42.138
Good night, ma'am.

54:55.905 --> 54:57.593
I'm a lucky man, Owen.

54:57.627 --> 55:00.199
You'll get
no quarrel from me.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.721
There's something
we need to discuss.

55:17.659 --> 55:19.422
Sir?

55:19.424 --> 55:21.211
The day of my shooting,

55:21.245 --> 55:23.461
where were you?

55:25.788 --> 55:27.869
As I told you, sir,
I'm sorry.

55:27.966 --> 55:30.030
I ran into a friend

55:30.032 --> 55:32.473
and lost track
of the time.

55:32.507 --> 55:34.524
Right.

55:36.861 --> 55:40.801
Was this friend
from Ireland by any chance?

55:50.344 --> 55:53.329
I'm not sure
what you mean, sir.

55:56.993 --> 55:59.773
You know exactly
what I mean.

56:04.067 --> 56:06.531
The cause, Owen...

56:06.565 --> 56:08.246
You've never left it.

56:08.281 --> 56:11.109
<i>That's why you're
really here, isn't it?</i>

56:11.111 --> 56:13.460
<i>Why you stayed
in Atlantic City?</i>

56:14.332 --> 56:16.350
Aye.

56:16.534 --> 56:19.070
<i>I want you to set up a meeting,</i>

56:19.184 --> 56:22.651
me and John McGarrigle,
in Belfast.

56:22.799 --> 56:26.028
- Sir?
- We'll set sail immediately.

56:26.062 --> 56:29.543
You tell him
I have a proposition.

56:54.225 --> 56:56.474
A week, maybe two,

56:56.536 --> 56:58.092
we'll be right back
in business.

56:58.114 --> 56:59.615
All's I need
is the booze.

56:59.651 --> 57:00.961
Right right, I heard
you the first time.

57:00.962 --> 57:02.270
Hey!

57:03.436 --> 57:05.109
What the fuck's
with you?

57:05.128 --> 57:07.403
I don't like waiting on line
when I need to talk.

57:07.437 --> 57:10.006
- So?
- My brother.

57:10.008 --> 57:13.892
- What about him?
- He's smarter than you are

57:13.894 --> 57:16.174
and a lot more
dangerous.

57:16.176 --> 57:19.242
- Speak for yourself.
- I'm trying to help you, kid.

57:19.268 --> 57:21.557
Don't underestimate him.

57:22.624 --> 57:24.990
Fuck you, Eli.

57:26.150 --> 57:28.592
You come here to piss
all over my party?

57:28.626 --> 57:30.785
Yeah.

57:30.787 --> 57:32.536
That's why I came.

57:40.453 --> 57:42.667
Whew.

57:42.684 --> 57:45.157
- So what's the plan?
- What plan?

57:45.190 --> 57:48.537
- For the liquor.
- Al's got a connection.

57:50.323 --> 57:52.788
- Capone from Chicago?
- Oh.

57:52.822 --> 57:56.301
The fella Remus
from Cincinnati.

57:56.335 --> 57:58.302
He gets pure
government liquor.

57:58.336 --> 58:00.886
- We can cut it right down.
- Nice.

58:02.876 --> 58:05.658
- What the fuck did you bring him for?
- Manny?

58:05.692 --> 58:08.528
- He's all right.
- He's a pain in my ass.

58:08.562 --> 58:10.733
- Well, you do owe him money.
- Really?

58:10.787 --> 58:13.346
'Cause he only reminds me about
it every five fucking minutes.

58:15.280 --> 58:17.209
That's right, you cocksucker.
We're talking about you.

58:19.841 --> 58:22.481
I said you're an asshole,
you fucking Jew bastard!

58:22.515 --> 58:24.778
I'd knock that off
if I was you.

58:24.817 --> 58:26.833
- What?
- The Jew stuff.

58:26.835 --> 58:29.403
- He ain't the type I'd play with.
- Right right.

58:29.438 --> 58:31.211
'Cause you're
his friend.

58:32.459 --> 58:34.537
- What?
- Come down.

58:34.552 --> 58:37.380
- I can't hear you.
- Come down, join the party.

58:37.549 --> 58:40.668
All right, all right.
Sure, we'll be right down.

58:40.702 --> 58:42.661
Hey!

58:45.729 --> 58:47.892
- Did he fall?
- Is he all right?

58:47.894 --> 58:50.009
- Somebody pushed him.
- Oh my goodness.

58:50.043 --> 58:52.590
<i>Somebody pushed him.</i>

58:52.625 --> 58:57.018
<i>- My oh my.
- Is he okay?</i>

58:59.367 --> 59:01.626
<i>Shh shh shh.</i>

59:18.249 --> 59:20.454
Shh shh shh.

59:29.433 --> 59:32.085
She's warm again.

59:39.634 --> 59:41.563
Shh.
