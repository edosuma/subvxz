00:05.536 --> 00:07.078
Stan:
SCHOOL VACATION--

00:07.078 --> 00:09.610
A TIME WHEN YOU TAKE A BREAK
FROM YOUR NORMAL ROUTINE.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.543
YOU SLEEP IN TILL NOON,
PLAY BALL IN THE PARK,

00:12.543 --> 00:14.545
STUFF YOUR FACE
WITH JUNK FOOD--

00:14.545 --> 00:17.648
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT IS MY NORMAL ROUTINE!

00:17.648 --> 00:19.220
I LOVE VACATION!

00:19.220 --> 00:21.552
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

00:23.294 --> 00:26.527
SO, EVERYONE EXCITED
FOR VACATION?

00:26.527 --> 00:29.500
MM-HMM. I GOT MY VACATION
TO-DO LIST RIGHT HERE.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.503
I'VE GOT MY TO-DO LIST
TOO: "EAT MUFFIN."

00:34.065 --> 00:37.208
THIS IS A LIST
OF ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES

00:37.208 --> 00:38.539
THAT I WANT TO GET THROUGH
ON VACATION.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.511
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
ON YOUR LIST?

00:40.511 --> 00:43.314
YOU MEAN AFTER
"LAMINATE THE LIST"?

00:43.314 --> 00:45.516
I'M GONNA FINISH WRITING
MY ONE-WOMAN SHOW,

00:45.516 --> 00:50.221
A DRAMATIC TELLING OF MY LIFE:
"AVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE."

00:50.221 --> 00:52.783
FINISH? YOU MEAN
YOU'VE ALREADY STARTED?

00:54.325 --> 00:56.557
WHOA.
I WAS BORN!

00:58.259 --> 01:00.631
IF ONLY IF IT WERE THAT EASY.
YOU CAME OUT FEET-FIRST.

01:00.631 --> 01:02.693
OH. QUICK REWRITE.

01:04.135 --> 01:06.497
I WAS BORN.

01:08.099 --> 01:09.670
AND THEN I LEARNED TO STAND.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.143
AND WALK. AND DANCE!

01:14.375 --> 01:16.607
THEN I LEARNED
TO OPEN THE DOOR.

01:18.109 --> 01:20.681
SO, TYLER, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE PLANNED FOR VACATION?

01:20.681 --> 01:23.654
SOMETHING MUCH LESS CREEPY
THAN THE FOUR-FOOT BABY.

01:23.654 --> 01:26.757
I'M GONNA MASTER
SOME NEW TRICKS
ON MY BMX BIKE.

01:26.757 --> 01:29.620
BY THE WAY,
CAN I HAVE MONEY
FOR A NEW BMX BIKE?

01:29.620 --> 01:33.664
HERE'S A CRAZY IDEA:
WHY DON'T YOU GET A JOB
AND EARN THE MONEY YOURSELF?

01:33.664 --> 01:35.666
THAT IS A CRAZY IDEA!

01:35.666 --> 01:36.697
HA HA HA HA!
HA HA HA HA!

01:36.697 --> 01:38.769
I'M SERIOUS, SON.

01:38.769 --> 01:41.532
LOOK, IF YOU GET A BIKE
WITH MONEY YOU EARNED,

01:41.532 --> 01:43.604
IT'S GONNA MEAN
SO MUCH MORE TO YOU.

01:43.604 --> 01:47.478
BUT I WANT IT TO MEAN
SO MUCH MORE TO YOU.

01:47.478 --> 01:49.610
YOUR FATHER'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE GETTING A JOB.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.582
I MAY HAVE MISPLAYED THAT ONE.

01:51.582 --> 01:53.584
I'M NEVER ASKING YOU
FOR ANYTHING AGAIN!

01:53.584 --> 01:54.645
OKAY.
OKAY.

01:54.645 --> 01:57.318
I MAY HAVE
MISPLAYED THAT ONE.

01:57.318 --> 02:00.621
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT GETTING A JOB?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.523
MOMMY DOESN'T HAVE A JOB.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.396
OH, REALLY?

02:05.396 --> 02:09.560
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING.
DADDY WORKS WITH PATIENTS
ALL DAY.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.831
AHA! AHA!

02:10.831 --> 02:14.535
SWEETIE, PLEASE
LEAVE DADDY OUT OF THIS.

02:14.535 --> 02:18.839
UH, CHLOE, BEING A MOMMY
IS THE HARDEST JOB OF ALL.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.671
HARDER THAN DADDY'S JOB?

02:20.671 --> 02:22.273
( laughs )

02:24.715 --> 02:27.848
ALL RIGHT, CHLOE,
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT MOMMY DOES.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.581
WHILE YOU'RE ON VACATION
THIS WEEK, YOU'LL DO
EVERYTHING I DO.

02:30.581 --> 02:33.654
I GET TO BE MOMMY
FOR VACATION? YAY!

02:33.654 --> 02:36.357
AND YOUR FIRST JOB
IS TO CHASTISE DADDY

02:36.357 --> 02:38.929
FOR WEASELING OUT
OF THIS CONVERSATION.

02:40.731 --> 02:42.893
BENNETT!

02:42.893 --> 02:45.696
♪♪

03:01.682 --> 03:04.215
Tyler: I'VE GOTTA
LOOK FOR A JOB.

03:04.215 --> 03:05.416
MY DAD JUST WON'T STOP
BUGGING ME ABOUT IT.

03:05.416 --> 03:07.418
I WISH I COULD
FIND A JOB IN THE PARK.

03:07.418 --> 03:09.560
I MEAN, I'M HERE
ALL THE TIME ANYWAY.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.892
Stan: I WISH I COULD
TELL HIM ABOUT THE SIGN,
BUT THERE'S

03:11.892 --> 03:14.465
TOO MANY PEOPLE
AROUND.

03:14.465 --> 03:16.367
YOU WANT ME
TO THROW IT, BOY?

03:16.367 --> 03:17.968
ALL RIGHT. GO GET IT!

03:19.300 --> 03:22.373
WHERE AM I GONNA
FIND A JOB?

03:22.373 --> 03:26.537
OH, STAN.
NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD.

03:26.537 --> 03:29.440
BUT NOT ME. I'VE GOT TO
SOMEHOW LOOK FOR A JOB.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.782
HERE YOU GO, BOY!

03:31.782 --> 03:34.715
SERIOUSLY?

03:34.715 --> 03:37.418
HEY! TYLER AND STAN!

03:37.418 --> 03:39.890
Stan: MEET "THE HAWK,"
OWNER OF THE FOOD TRUCK.

03:39.890 --> 03:41.422
HE'S A LOT LIKE HIS TRUCK--

03:41.422 --> 03:44.395
CONSTANTLY FAILING
HEALTH INSPECTIONS.

03:44.395 --> 03:46.897
HEY, HAWK. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

03:46.897 --> 03:50.901
OH, BEEN IN COLORADO
SLINGIN' FRIES
AND ROCK CLIMBIN'.

03:50.901 --> 03:52.403
DID A LOT OF THIS--

03:52.403 --> 03:54.405
HELP! HELP!

03:54.405 --> 03:56.637
I'M NOT FINGER-STRONG!

03:56.637 --> 03:58.539
HA HA HA HA!

03:58.539 --> 04:03.444
SO YOU COULD JUST DRIVE ALL OVER
AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT?

04:03.444 --> 04:05.616
MAN, I WISH I COULD FIND A JOB
AS COOL AS YOURS.

04:05.616 --> 04:08.479
LOOKING FOR A JOB?
WHY DON'T YOU APPLY HERE?

04:08.479 --> 04:09.620
YOU HAVE AN OPENING?

04:09.620 --> 04:12.453
MAN, YOU SHOULD PUT OUT
A SIGN OR SOMETHING.

04:12.453 --> 04:15.326
I'D LOVE TO WORK
IN THE FOOD TRUCK.
GREAT! YOU'RE HIRED!

04:15.326 --> 04:16.687
HA HA HA HA!

04:16.687 --> 04:18.959
Stan: WOW,
THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.492
OKAY, NOW IT'S GOING ON
TOO LONG.

04:23.734 --> 04:25.265
Ellen: ALL RIGHT, CHLOE,

04:25.265 --> 04:26.837
YOUR FIRST MOMMY JOB
IS TO RINSE THE DISHES

04:26.837 --> 04:28.469
AND THEN PUT THEM IN
THE DISHWASHER.

04:28.469 --> 04:31.502
WE HAVE A DISHWASHER--
WHY DO WE HAVE TO
RINSE THE DISHES?

04:31.502 --> 04:34.274
NOBODY KNOWS.
JUST ACCEPT IT.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.648
OH. HEY, MOM.
MINI-MOM.

04:37.648 --> 04:39.610
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH
THAT BIG BLOCK OF ICE?

04:39.610 --> 04:43.053
ABOUT TO CHECK "ICE SCULPTURE"
OFF MY ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES LIST.

04:43.053 --> 04:46.357
OH, WELL, MENTALLY.
BECAUSE NOW IT'S LAMINATED.

04:46.357 --> 04:50.521
WELL, THIS BLOCK OF ICE
ISN'T GONNA CARVE ITSELF.
ALL RIGHT, DEAR.

04:50.521 --> 04:52.363
CHLOE, WHEN WE'RE
DONE WITH THIS,
WE'RE GONNA--

04:52.363 --> 04:53.364
WAIT, WHAT DID SHE JUST SAY?

04:53.364 --> 04:55.566
( power tool buzzing )
OHHH!

04:58.329 --> 05:01.402
THIS IS GONNA TAKE FOREVER.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.873
STAN.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.042
SO MUCH EASIER.

05:12.042 --> 05:15.416
AND NO SOAPY RESIDUE!

05:16.687 --> 05:19.049
MEAT BAG UP!
MEAT BAG UP!

05:19.049 --> 05:23.023
THANKS. AND DON'T FORGET,
THAT COMBO COMES WITH FRIES...
AND A SMILE.

05:25.456 --> 05:28.459
TYLER, YOU'RE GREAT
WITH THE CUSTOMERS.

05:28.459 --> 05:29.860
YOU GOT STYLE.

05:29.860 --> 05:32.533
I COULDA USED YOU
WHEN I DROVE MY TRUCK
TO ALASKA.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.706
YOU DROVE THIS TRUCK
TO ALASKA?
NOT THIS ONE.

05:35.706 --> 05:38.469
THAT TRUCK WAS
COMMANDEERED
BY BEARS.

05:38.469 --> 05:39.910
OHH. THEY WENT CRAZY.

05:39.910 --> 05:42.543
YOU'D THINK THEY'D
NEVER SEEN A TACO BEFORE.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.915
YOU HAVE THE MOST
EXCITING LIFE!

05:44.915 --> 05:46.717
HEY, HOW YA DOIN'
ON THE REGISTER?

05:46.717 --> 05:48.719
EH, I DON'T NEED
THE REGISTER.

05:48.719 --> 05:50.080
I DO IT ALL IN MY HEAD.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.483
WE CLEARED $213.54,

05:52.483 --> 05:55.926
NOT INCLUDING THE SIX BURGERS
AND 214 FRIES YOU ATE.

05:55.926 --> 05:59.390
IF YOU MONITOR ME,
I'LL NEVER LOSE WEIGHT.

05:59.390 --> 06:01.361
BUT I'M IMPRESSED
YOU TRACKED ALL THAT
IN YOUR HEAD!

06:01.361 --> 06:04.465
HA HA HA! EVERYBODY'S
GOT A TALENT, HUH?

06:04.465 --> 06:05.866
WATCH THIS.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.672
NYAAAAAH!

06:13.143 --> 06:14.605
HO HO HO HO!

06:14.605 --> 06:16.447
THAT'S SO COOL!
HOW'D YOU LEARN
HOW TO DO THAT?

06:16.447 --> 06:19.810
DIDN'T KNOW I COULD
TILL JUST NOW.

06:19.810 --> 06:23.854
ALWAYS TRY NEW THINGS, TYLER.
FLY FREE.

06:23.854 --> 06:26.156
IS THAT WHY THEY
CALL YOU THE HAWK?

06:26.156 --> 06:28.118
'CAUSE YOU FLY FREE?
NO, NO,

06:28.118 --> 06:30.791
IT'S 'CAUSE...
( dredges up phlegm )...

06:34.525 --> 06:36.697
IT'S 'CAUSE I STEAL EGGS.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.874
WHOA, WHOA. CHLOE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:43.874 --> 06:47.407
YOU TOLD ME
TO DO THE LAUNDRY.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.510
IN THE WASHING MACHINE.

06:49.510 --> 06:53.113
WHY SHOULD
THE WASHING MACHINE
HAVE ALL THE FUN?

06:53.113 --> 06:55.816
MOMMY'S WORK
IS NOT ABOUT FUN.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.718
IT'S SERIOUS BUSINESS.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.690
AND BY THE WAY,
DON'T EXPECT A LOT
OF APPRECIATION,

06:59.690 --> 07:01.492
BECAUSE BELIEVE ME,
YOU WON'T GET ANY.

07:01.492 --> 07:04.555
CHLOE, YOU ARE DOING
A WONDERFUL JOB!

07:04.555 --> 07:07.197
THIS HOUSE HAS
NEVER LOOKED BETTER.

07:07.197 --> 07:09.429
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE WOULD DO WITHOUT YOU.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.101
YAY! TIME TO DO
THE LAUNDRY!

07:11.101 --> 07:12.633
WHOO-HOO!

07:12.633 --> 07:15.536
( laughing, squealing )

07:15.536 --> 07:18.208
GREAT JOB, SWEETHEART!

07:18.208 --> 07:21.441
ALL THIS HARD WORK--
AND WITH A SMILE, TOO.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.673
ISN'T SHE JUST THE--

07:22.673 --> 07:25.015
UHHH!

07:25.015 --> 07:26.216
( laughing, shrieking )

07:28.949 --> 07:33.083
Stan: YOU'RE HOME!
YOU'RE HO-HO-HO-HOME!
HEE HEE!

07:33.083 --> 07:36.557
OH, STAN, YOU MUST HAVE
REALLY MISSED ME WHILE
I WAS AT WORK.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.529
NO,
YOU SMELL LIKE MEAT.

07:38.529 --> 07:40.931
YOU SPEND YOUR DAY
WITH MEAT.

07:40.931 --> 07:42.793
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS--

07:42.793 --> 07:45.496
I WANT TO BE YOU.

07:45.496 --> 07:47.237
IT'S AN AWESOME JOB.

07:47.237 --> 07:50.470
I WISH I COULD HAVE
MY OWN FOOD TRUCK ONE DAY,
JUST LIKE THE HAWK.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.603
WELL, WHY CAN'T YOU?
WELL, YOU KNOW,

07:52.603 --> 07:54.474
MOM AND DAD WANT ME
TO GET GOOD GRADES,

07:54.474 --> 07:56.476
GO TO COLLEGE,
GET A GOOD JOB.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.748
YEAH, BUT WHAT
DO YOU WANT?

07:57.748 --> 07:59.710
I WANT TO LIVE LIKE THE HAWK.

07:59.710 --> 08:01.211
THEN GO FOR IT!

08:01.211 --> 08:03.483
AS A DOG,
THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW:

08:03.483 --> 08:06.116
WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU WANT, YOU GO AFTER IT.

08:06.116 --> 08:08.819
( sniffs )
OOH, PORCUPINE!

08:11.592 --> 08:13.023
WOOF! WOOF!

08:13.023 --> 08:14.825
( clatter, animal shrieks )

08:17.698 --> 08:19.600
WHEN YOU GO AFTER WHAT YOU WANT,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.872
NOTHING BAD EVER HAPPENS.

08:23.774 --> 08:25.706
BUT THE HAWK
IS SO COOL!

08:25.706 --> 08:28.178
I COULD SEE MYSELF
LIVING MY LIFE
JUST LIKE HIM.

08:28.178 --> 08:30.841
TYLER, WORKING
IN A FOOD TRUCK
IS NOT A LIFE GOAL!

08:30.841 --> 08:34.014
A LIFE GOAL SHOULD BE
A LAWYER OR A SCIENTIST

08:34.014 --> 08:37.788
OR, I DON'T KNOW,
BEST-SELLING AUTHOR-
SLASH-CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST.

08:37.788 --> 08:40.621
OR A MUCH-APPRECIATED
HOMEMAKER.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.252
YOU WANT ME TO BE
A HOMEMAKER?

08:42.252 --> 08:44.254
WELL, NOT YOU.

08:44.254 --> 08:45.295
WHY NOT HIM?

08:45.295 --> 08:47.527
OR A MUCH-APPRECIATED
HOMEMAKER!

08:47.527 --> 08:49.830
LISTEN, BENNETT,
WE'RE GETTING WAY
AHEAD OF OURSELVES HERE.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.602
IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S GONNA QUIT SCHOOL

08:51.602 --> 08:52.603
AND GO OFF AND DO THIS.

08:52.603 --> 08:54.605
HEY-- MOM,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

08:54.605 --> 08:56.937
YOU KNOW, THE HAWK
DIDN'T EVEN FINISH
HIGH SCHOOL.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.269
I MAY HAVE
MISPLAYED THAT ONE.

08:59.269 --> 09:03.143
I THINK THIS "HAWK" CHARACTER
IS BECOMING A BAD INFLUENCE
ON YOU.

09:03.143 --> 09:07.077
I DON'T WANT A FRY COOK
ACTING AS MY SON'S
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.

09:07.077 --> 09:09.850
YEAH. YOU'RE GONNA
FOCUS ON YOUR SCHOOLWORK,
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO COLLEGE,

09:09.850 --> 09:11.582
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A REAL CAREER--

09:11.582 --> 09:13.584
POSSIBLY AS
A HOMEMAKER.

09:13.584 --> 09:14.585
END OF DISCUSSION.

09:14.585 --> 09:17.557
YES. THEY'RE RIGHT,
END OF DISCUSSION.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.029
OH, THAT'S FUN TO SAY!

09:19.029 --> 09:21.561
YOU'RE NOT EVEN HEARING ME.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.964
AND THANKS FOR
TAKING THEIR SIDE.

09:25.896 --> 09:28.568
HEY! I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.940
WELL, I'M TRYING
TO LIVE RIGHT NOW,

09:29.940 --> 09:32.843
AND RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
MY BACK AGAINST MOM AND DAD.

09:32.843 --> 09:34.675
EVEN WHEN THEY'RE
A HUNDRED PERCENT RIGHT

09:34.675 --> 09:36.076
AND YOU'RE
A HUNDRED PERCENT WRONG?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.678
ESPECIALLY THEN!

09:37.678 --> 09:39.349
LISTEN, TYLER--

09:39.349 --> 09:41.081
AND THIS ISN'T
COMING FROM THEM,

09:41.081 --> 09:43.013
IT'S COMING FROM ME--

09:43.013 --> 09:45.686
SON, YOU'RE GOING
NOWHERE FAST!

09:45.686 --> 09:47.958
YOU'RE JUST AS BAD
AS THEY ARE.

09:51.962 --> 09:55.325
DID YOU KNOW THAT
PORCUPINES ARE NOT
MADE OF PORK?

10:01.832 --> 10:05.075
SO, HOW IS YOUR INSANE
OVERACHIEVER'S LIST COMING?

10:05.075 --> 10:09.710
UH, EXCUSE ME--
INSANE "ARTISTIC
ACTIVITIES" LIST.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.241
AND IT'S COMING ALONG GREAT.

10:11.241 --> 10:13.343
I'M JUST EDITING
THE TRACK OF A NEW
VIDEO I JUST MADE.

10:13.343 --> 10:14.815
OH, THAT.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.888
UH, YEAH. I MADE
A FEW SMALL IMPROVEMENTS.

10:17.888 --> 10:20.220
♪ BOW, BOW,
BOW-BIDDA BOW, BOW, BOW ♪

AVERY, DINNER'S

10:42.642 --> 10:44.244
AND I NEED YOU
TO SET THE TABLE.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.377
BUT I DID IT LAST--
I DON'T NEED A DEBATE;
I NEED THE TABLE SET.

10:47.377 --> 10:49.119
DINNER!

10:49.119 --> 10:50.180
( doorbell rings )

10:53.884 --> 10:54.925
CAN I HELP YOU?

10:54.925 --> 10:56.256

AHH...HO HO HO!

11:03.133 --> 11:06.737
UH-UH...

11:06.737 --> 11:09.269
TYLER INVITED ME
FOR DINNER!

11:09.269 --> 11:11.141
(as The Hawk):
TYLER DIDN'T TELL US
YOU WERE COMING!

11:11.141 --> 11:13.173
(as The Hawk):
TYLER, GET IN HERE NOW!

11:14.444 --> 11:17.978
OH! YEAH. I KINDA
INVITED THE HAWK
TO DINNER.

11:17.978 --> 11:21.181
I BROUGHT YOU
A HOSTESS GIFT.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.914
I DIDN'T KNOW IF WE WERE
HAVING MEAT OR FISH,

11:23.914 --> 11:25.455
SO I BROUGHT MEAT.

11:27.017 --> 11:28.358
I HATE FISH.

11:28.358 --> 11:30.260
OH. WELL...

11:30.260 --> 11:32.262
THANK YOU.
EXCUSE US ONE MOMENT...

11:32.262 --> 11:33.423
"THE HAWK."

11:34.965 --> 11:36.967
Stan:
I'VE HEARD THE LEGENDS,

11:36.967 --> 11:39.069
BUT NEVER BELIEVED
IT WAS POSSIBLE--

11:39.069 --> 11:41.131
LOW TABLE MEAT.

11:41.131 --> 11:44.434
IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING!

11:44.434 --> 11:46.737
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
INVITING HIM HERE?

11:46.737 --> 11:48.879
YOU SAID YOU THOUGHT
HE WASN'T A GOOD INFLUENCE.

11:48.879 --> 11:51.011
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
HOW COOL HE IS.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.814
YOU REALLY PUT US
ON THE SPOT.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.817
YOU SHOULD BE
MORE LIKE THE HAWK--
JUST GO WITH THE FLOW.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.189
MAYBE--
AAH!

11:59.189 --> 12:01.291
MAYBE I SHOULD,
UH, TAKE OFF.

12:01.291 --> 12:03.223
I'M GETTIN' THAT
FAMILIAR VIBE

12:03.223 --> 12:05.155
LIKE RIGHT BEFORE
THE COPS SHOW UP.

12:05.155 --> 12:07.898
NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO!

12:07.898 --> 12:09.399
I INVITED YOU
TO DINNER!

12:09.399 --> 12:13.864
IF WE'RE HAVING GUESTS
FOR DINNER, I COULD USE
A LITTLE NOTICE.

12:13.864 --> 12:16.066
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO CAUSE TROUBLE

12:16.066 --> 12:19.039
OR GET YOUR LITTLE MAID
UPSET.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.041
NO, YOU CAN'T GO!

12:21.041 --> 12:23.113
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM
ABOUT THE COOL LIFE YOU LEAD!

12:23.113 --> 12:26.516
HOW YOU TRAVEL THE WORLD
AND SPEAK THREE LANGUAGES.

12:26.516 --> 12:29.419
TWO OF 'EM ARE MADE UP.

12:29.419 --> 12:33.223
BUT HEY, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T LET PEOPLE TELL ME
HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE,

12:33.223 --> 12:35.425
I'M NOT GONNA TELL ANYONE
HOW TO LIVE THEIRS.

12:35.425 --> 12:39.059
A NINJA MASTER
TAUGHT ME THAT.

12:39.059 --> 12:43.763
HE ALSO TAUGHT ME
HOW TO GRACEFULLY LEAVE
AN AWKWARD SITUATION.

12:51.441 --> 12:52.903
SEE YA!

12:54.374 --> 12:57.107
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

12:57.107 --> 12:59.179
THANKS A LOT FOR MAKING HIM
NOT FEEL WELCOME.

12:59.179 --> 13:02.112
I'M SURE HE DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.
HE'S IN HIS OWN WORLD!

13:02.112 --> 13:05.255
LIKE THAT KID AT THE PARK
WHO FLIES THE INVISIBLE KITE.

13:05.255 --> 13:07.357
HONEY, THAT BOY IS ACTUALLY
A PATIENT OF MINE.

13:07.357 --> 13:09.119
AND HE WAS DOING MUCH BETTER...

13:09.119 --> 13:12.122
UNTIL A TRASH CAN
FELL ON HIM.

13:12.122 --> 13:14.264
IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME,

13:14.264 --> 13:16.796
THEN I'M NOT GONNA RESPECT
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.799
OKAY, I'M QUITTING SCHOOL
TO WORK IN THE FOOD TRUCK
FULL-TIME.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.232
THE ONLY THING
THAT YOU ARE QUITTING
IS THAT JOB.

13:22.232 --> 13:23.433
YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK THERE.

13:23.433 --> 13:25.175
THIS IS SO UNFAIR!

13:26.806 --> 13:30.881
CAN WE NOT SIT DOWN
AND EAT AS A FAMILY
JUST ONCE?!

13:30.881 --> 13:32.312
OHHH!

13:38.989 --> 13:40.150
THERE WE GO.

13:40.150 --> 13:44.354
UH, LET ME GUESS.
3-D CHALK ART WAS ON YOUR LIST.

13:44.354 --> 13:47.097
(imitating echo)
YES! YES! YES....

13:47.097 --> 13:50.260
OH, COME ON. DO YOU THINK
ANYONE WOULD BELIEVE

13:50.260 --> 13:52.963
THIS IS REALLY
A BOTTOMLESS PIT?

13:52.963 --> 13:53.864
( gasps )

13:55.465 --> 14:00.510
(imitates echo)
I STAND CORRECTED!
ECTED...ECTED...

14:00.510 --> 14:03.113
OH, MY GOSH.
IS THAT TYLER
IN THE FOOD TRUCK?

14:03.113 --> 14:04.915
I THOUGHT YOUR PARENTS
MADE HIM QUIT.

14:04.915 --> 14:08.979
SORRY, GUYS,
I CAN'T HANG NOW.
I'M WORKIN'

14:08.979 --> 14:13.523
WOW. I'VE NEVER SEEN TYLER
SAY NO TO GOOFING OFF
WITH HIS FRIENDS.

14:42.452 --> 14:44.955
YOU CAN'T TELL MOM AND DAD
I'M STILL WORKING HERE.

14:44.955 --> 14:46.886
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.960
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I CAN'T GIVE IT UP.
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.362

14:52.362 --> 14:54.464
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD QUIT.

14:54.464 --> 14:58.668
YOU'RE NOT SLACKING OFF.
YOU'RE FOCUSED AND YOU'RE
TAKING YOUR WORK SERIOUSLY.

14:58.668 --> 15:01.671

15:01.671 --> 15:04.174

15:04.174 --> 15:05.976
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
BELIEVE IN YOU.

15:05.976 --> 15:08.908

15:08.908 --> 15:10.610

15:10.610 --> 15:12.312
WHAT? HOPE IT'S OKAY.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.314
YEAH, ME TOO.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.587
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SHUT DOWN THE TRUCK.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

15:17.587 --> 15:18.949
OH, IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE READY.

15:18.949 --> 15:21.321
I TRUST YA.
DON'T LET ME DOWN.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.953
DON'T WORRY,I WON'T.

15:22.953 --> 15:24.424

TYLER'S OUT HERE--

15:31.301 --> 15:34.965
OH, I AM GONNA GET
ALL UP IN THAT GRILL!

15:34.965 --> 15:37.437
YOU KNOW, MOM AND DAD
SHOULD REALLY SEE
HOW GREAT YOU'RE DOING.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.339
NO! IF THEY FIND OUT
I'M WORKING HERE,

15:39.339 --> 15:41.671
IT'LL JUST MAKE IT WORSE.
YOU CAN'T TELL THEM.

15:41.671 --> 15:43.673
BUT YOU KNOW
WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING
I WANT TO SAY

15:43.673 --> 15:45.615
HOW HARD IT IS FOR ME
NOT TO SAY IT.

15:45.615 --> 15:47.717

15:47.717 --> 15:49.949

ARE TERRORIZING A NURSING HOME.

16:03.733 --> 16:05.965
YOU'RE A GOOD SISTER.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.967

HAVING MY BACK.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.499

16:11.001 --> 16:14.604

IT'S OKAY,
I JUST WASHED MY PAWS.

16:17.507 --> 16:18.678

SWEETIE?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.710
DOING WHAT MOMMY DOES
WHEN SHE NEEDS A BREAK.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.512
WATCHING ONE OF HER SHOWS.

16:22.512 --> 16:24.654
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THAT
FROM YOUR OLD MAN!

16:24.654 --> 16:26.686
KICK HIM TO THE CURB!

16:29.359 --> 16:31.161
AVERY, HONEY,
HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR BROTHER?

16:31.161 --> 16:32.592
HE'S BEEN GONE ALL DAY.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.724
I'M NOT ON TRIAL HERE.
STOP GRILLING ME!

16:34.724 --> 16:38.168

AW, LOOK AT STAN.

16:47.177 --> 16:50.340
HE'S SO CUTE!
OH, GOOD. HE'S DISTRACTED.

16:50.340 --> 16:51.681
WHAT WERE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

16:51.681 --> 16:54.644
THE FACT THAT I KNOW
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
ABOUT TYLER'S WHEREABOUTS.

16:54.644 --> 16:58.048
WELL, I WAS JUST
ADORABLE FOR NOTHING.

16:58.048 --> 17:01.321
WELL, TYLER'S PROBABLY
MESSING AROUND SOMEWHERE
LIKE ALWAYS.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.653
IT'S PROBABLY WHY HE WANTED
TO WORK IN THE FOOD TRUCK
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

17:03.653 --> 17:06.156
TO FLIRT WITH GIRLS
AND HANG AROUND HIS FRIENDS
AT THE PARK.

17:06.156 --> 17:08.328
AND HANG OUT WITH
THAT GOOFBALL HAWK.

17:08.328 --> 17:11.401
SO MUCH FOR HIM GETTING A JOB
TO LEARN RESPONSIBILITY.

17:11.401 --> 17:14.134
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S GONNA TAKE
FOR OUR SON TO GROW UP.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.706
TIFFANY'S DATING

17:16.706 --> 17:18.768
WHAT?
WHAT?

17:18.768 --> 17:20.770
AND ALSO TYLER'S
WORKING IN THE FOOD TRUCK.

17:20.770 --> 17:21.771
WHAT?!
WHAT?!

17:21.771 --> 17:23.743
HE HAS NO BUSINESS
BEING A FATHER!

17:23.743 --> 17:25.715
WHAT?!!
WHAT?!!

17:25.715 --> 17:29.249
JEFF AND KRISTINA
ARE A HOT MESS.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.281
AVERY, WHAT DID YOU SAY
ABOUT TYLER?

17:31.281 --> 17:33.353
TYLER'S STILL WORKING
IN THE FOOD TRUCK.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.824
BUT IT'S OKAY--

17:34.824 --> 17:37.627
HE'S TAKING IT SERIOUSLY.
HE'S NOT GOOFING OFF.

17:37.627 --> 17:41.261
YOU GUYS REALLY NEED
TO GO DOWN THERE AND SEE
HOW GREAT OF A JOB HE'S DOING.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.094
OH, WE'RE GOING DOWN THERE,
ALL RIGHT--TO DRAG HIM HOME.

17:44.094 --> 17:45.695
NO, DAD, THIS ISN'T
WHAT I WANTED!

17:45.695 --> 17:47.497
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE DISOBEYED US.

17:47.497 --> 17:48.638
Stan: I CAN'T BELIEVE
JEFF AND KRISTINA

17:48.638 --> 17:52.172
BLEW ALL THEIR LOTTERY MONEY
ON AN ABOVE-GROUND POOL!

17:52.172 --> 17:53.803
COME ON!

17:56.576 --> 17:59.078
( clamoring )

17:59.078 --> 18:00.610
WELL, WOULD YOU
TAKE A LOOK AT--

18:03.783 --> 18:05.115
DAD, REALLY?

18:06.716 --> 18:10.190
LOOK, EVERYONE,
I'M SORRY I'M NOT
GETTING THE ORDERS RIGHT!

18:10.190 --> 18:12.722
IT'S JUST A LITTLE MORE
THAN I CAN HANDLE!

18:12.722 --> 18:15.865
YEP. TYLER'S DOING
A GREAT JOB.

18:15.865 --> 18:18.268
I WAS ONLY GONE
FIVE MINUTES.

18:18.268 --> 18:22.372
KIDS--
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

18:22.372 --> 18:24.334
TYLER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING
STILL WORKING HERE?

18:24.334 --> 18:26.476
THANKS FOR
RATTING ME OUT,
AVERY!

18:26.476 --> 18:28.808
I TRIED HOLDING IT IN,
BUT IT JUST BURST OUT!

18:28.808 --> 18:30.140
I'M SORRY, TYLER.

18:30.140 --> 18:33.643
I JUST TOLD THEM BECAUSE
I WAS SO PROUD OF YOU.

18:33.643 --> 18:36.186
TYLER, COME DOWN!
YOU'RE COMING WITH US!

18:36.186 --> 18:40.150
JUST A SEC, ANGRY MOB!
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU!

18:40.150 --> 18:42.152
SORRY. EXCUSE ME.

18:42.152 --> 18:45.355
GUYS, I'M SORRY
I DISOBEYED YOU,

18:45.355 --> 18:48.158
AND I KNOW I'M IN TROUBLE,
BUT I CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

18:48.158 --> 18:49.829
OKAY? THE HAWK
PUT ME IN CHARGE.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.501
I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
HERE.

18:51.501 --> 18:53.163
I SEE WHAT ANGLE
YOU'RE PLAYING HERE.

18:53.163 --> 18:54.704
YOU'RE TALKING
"RESPONSIBILITY"

18:54.704 --> 18:56.366
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S
WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR,

18:56.366 --> 18:58.338
JUST SO YOU CAN SIT UP
IN THAT FOOD TRUCK,

18:58.338 --> 19:01.671
DEALING WITH AN ANGRY MOB,
SWEATING THROUGH YOUR SHIRT--

19:01.671 --> 19:04.674
I DON'T REALLY SEE
WHAT ANGLE HE'S PLAYING.

19:04.674 --> 19:05.745
THERE'S NO ANGLE.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.847
I PUT A COUPON ONLINE
FOR SPICY TACOS,

19:07.847 --> 19:09.679
AND BUSINESS WENT CRAZY.

19:09.679 --> 19:12.722
IF I DON'T HONOR IT,
IT'LL RUIN THE HAWK'S
REPUTATION.

19:12.722 --> 19:15.885
PLEASE! LET ME FIX THIS MESS.

19:15.885 --> 19:19.859
I THINK WE OWE SOMEBODY
AN APOLOGY.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.492
AVERY, I AM SO SORRY.

19:22.492 --> 19:25.465
WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE
DOUBTED YOU ABOUT TYLER.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.166
CAN I GET BACK
TO WORK NOW?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.938
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO
HONOR YOUR COMMITMENT,

19:28.938 --> 19:30.670
YOU CAN FINISH OUT THE DAY,

19:30.670 --> 19:32.242
BEFORE THAT ANGRY MOB
TEARS DOWN THE TRUCK.

19:32.242 --> 19:33.743
REALLY?
GO!

19:33.743 --> 19:36.506
THANKS.

19:36.506 --> 19:38.878
HE IS IN WAY OVER HIS HEAD.
MM-HMM.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.810
DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD HELP HIM OUT?

19:40.810 --> 19:43.413
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE WORKING
IN A FOOD TRUCK.

19:43.413 --> 19:46.816
HONEY, NEXT TIME
TYLER ASKS FOR MONEY
FOR A BMX BIKE,

19:46.816 --> 19:50.720
LET'S JUST GIVE HIM MONEY
FOR A BMX BIKE.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.664
( chatter )

19:58.798 --> 20:00.430
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP,
GUYS.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.232
I GUESS WE SHOULD
GO HOME NOW

20:02.232 --> 20:05.775
AND YOU CAN GROUND ME
OR MAKE ME CLEAN THE GARAGE

20:05.775 --> 20:06.906
OR WHATEVER
YOU'RE GONNA DO TO ME.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.738
CLEAN THE GARAGE?
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

20:08.738 --> 20:09.979
NEVER WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT.

20:09.979 --> 20:12.742
I MAY HAVE
MISPLAYED THAT ONE.

20:12.742 --> 20:15.815
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
TAKE THE HAIR NET
OFF NOW, DAD.

20:15.815 --> 20:19.319
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.791
TYLER! HA HA HA!

20:21.791 --> 20:23.793
HEARD THINGS GOT
A LITTLE BUSY TODAY!

20:23.793 --> 20:26.256
GOOD JOB!
HA HA HA HA!

20:26.256 --> 20:28.227
YOUR SON'S
A REAL HARD WORKER.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.560
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT HIM.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.802
PROBABLY GO BACK TO
THE WAY IT WAS TWO DAYS AGO.

20:32.802 --> 20:34.804
YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

20:34.804 --> 20:36.766
I THINK TODAY
WAS MY LAST DAY.

20:36.766 --> 20:39.739
UH...NOT SO FAST.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.712
TYLER, WE'VE SEEN
A SIDE OF YOU TODAY
WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

20:42.712 --> 20:45.745
YEAH, YOU REALLY
FOUND SOMETHING
YOU TAKE SERIOUSLY.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.877
SO I CAN KEEP THE JOB?
YES.

20:47.877 --> 20:49.619
BUT YOU'RE STAYING IN SCHOOL.

20:49.619 --> 20:51.281
THANKS.

20:51.281 --> 20:53.783
OH, THIS IS A GREAT DAY
FOR EVERYBODY.

20:53.783 --> 20:55.685
YOU GUYS WORKED
ALL THIS OUT,

20:55.685 --> 20:57.887
AND I FOUND OUT
I DON'T HAVE A MOLE.

20:57.887 --> 21:01.631
HE'S A EUROPEAN
BLACK BEAR HAMSTER.

21:01.631 --> 21:03.893
Ellen: OH...GOOD.

21:03.893 --> 21:06.496
WELL, "THE HAWK,"
I THINK WE OWE YOU
A DINNER.

21:06.496 --> 21:09.769
EXCELLENT!
I'M GONNA GO TO CHINOISE.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.672
I'LL SEND YOU THE BILL.

21:12.672 --> 21:16.746
Stan:
TYLER KEPT THE JOB HE LOVES,
AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

21:16.746 --> 21:21.050
ESPECIALLY SINCE I GET TO
LICK THE GREASE OFF HIM
AFTER EVERY SHIFT.

21:21.050 --> 21:23.653
I ALSO LEARNED
A VALUABLE LESSON--

21:23.653 --> 21:27.817
NEVER DRINK OUT
OF A PUBLIC TOILET
AFTER "SPICY TACO COUPON DAY."

21:29.819 --> 21:33.663
( Stan retching, gagging )

21:33.663 --> 21:35.795
( belching )

21:35.795 --> 21:38.728
HO. WHOA!

21:38.728 --> 21:40.730
Ellen: SO, CHLOE,

21:40.730 --> 21:42.872
WHAT DID YOU LEARN
BEING MOMMY THIS WEEK?

21:42.872 --> 21:44.904
BEING MOMMY
IS HARD WORK.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.676
THANK YOU.

21:46.676 --> 21:48.808
MUCH HARDER THAN
BEING A PSYCHOLOGIST.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.610
OH, REALLY?

21:52.782 --> 21:54.814
SOMETIMES I FEEL SAD,

21:54.814 --> 21:56.816
SOMETIMES OVERWHELMED,

21:56.816 --> 21:57.947
SOMETIMES LONELY.

21:57.947 --> 21:59.949
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

21:59.949 --> 22:02.792
YOU SHOULD WATCH A SILLY MOVIE.
THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME HAPPY.

22:02.792 --> 22:04.323
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.496
(giggles)
THIS IS EASY.

22:10.460 --> 22:11.631
( boing )
