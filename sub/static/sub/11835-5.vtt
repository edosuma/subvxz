WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:02.636
DONNELL:
Previously on The Practice...

00:02.669 --> 00:03.804
Is this all of it?

00:03.836 --> 00:05.971
This is every penny
I can get my hands on.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.107
Oh!

00:07.140 --> 00:08.208
You got till tomorrow.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.445
Twelve thousand
on number four to win.

00:12.478 --> 00:14.648
Go get them, baby!
Go get them, go!

00:17.317 --> 00:18.318
(breathing heavily)

00:20.120 --> 00:21.755
I won.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.590
I got in a jam
with a bookie.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.592
I borrowed money
for, like, seven hours.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.629
You took from a client's
trust fund. That's theft.

00:28.662 --> 00:31.932
We're required to notify
the client and the bar.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.134
If I don't, this whole firm
could get disbarred.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.402
I can't even believe
they're letting him out.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.238
Remember, he was never
actually charged

00:38.271 --> 00:40.406
in the kidnapping
of your son.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.675
The police know he did it.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.009
They just couldn't prove it.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.478
RICHARD: Plus, he's a convicted
child molester.

00:45.946 --> 00:48.515
What, exactly,
are you hiring me to do?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.951
We want to bury our son.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.919
Only he knows
where the body is.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.121
Wrongful death
for a murder

00:55.155 --> 00:57.390
that took place
18 years ago?

00:57.423 --> 00:58.825
They want closure.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.794
If I can create the threat
of a lawsuit,

01:00.827 --> 01:02.395
maybe we can get
this guy to reveal

01:02.428 --> 01:03.496
where the remains are.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.531
I didn't do it.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.799
Like you never molested

01:05.832 --> 01:08.001
those three little boys
who put you in here?

01:08.034 --> 01:11.104
I had nothing to do
with that Baldwin kid

01:11.137 --> 01:12.138
going missing.

01:12.172 --> 01:14.007
Have your attorney call me.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.476
You never did see him
abduct your son, did you?

01:16.510 --> 01:17.744
I didn't see it, but--

01:17.778 --> 01:19.312
LIGHTSTONE: So it could
have been somebody else.

01:19.345 --> 01:20.747
Nobody else was near Chad.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.517
Can you account
for such a coincidence

01:23.550 --> 01:25.886
a soon-to-be-convicted
child molester

01:25.919 --> 01:28.454
is within 50 feet of a child

01:28.488 --> 01:31.057
at the exact time
he's kidnapped?

01:31.091 --> 01:31.958
LIGHTSTONE: Objection.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.994
I'm going to let this case
go forward,

01:34.027 --> 01:35.729
but, Mr. Donnell, if you don't
come up with more,

01:35.762 --> 01:37.964
I will be dismissing it
at a later date.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.332
Mr. Donnell?

01:39.365 --> 01:40.466
Yes.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.036
I think I may be
Chad Baldwin.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.079
What makes you think
you're Chad Baldwin?

01:53.113 --> 01:56.482
I think my mother can answer
that better than I can.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.451
However,
I want your assurance

01:58.484 --> 02:00.220
that she's not going to get
in any trouble.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.888
Why would she?

02:02.488 --> 02:06.359
JAMES: Um, the man
who kidnapped Chad Baldwin...

02:06.392 --> 02:07.861
the man that you sued...

02:07.894 --> 02:09.229
John Pierce.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.532
He's the man who gave me
to my mother.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.669
ALLISON:
In Brockton, in 1983.

02:15.702 --> 02:19.039
It was the same year that
the Baldwins' child disappeared.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.307
He wasn't using
the same name then--

02:21.341 --> 02:23.677
But gave you a child?

02:23.710 --> 02:25.045
Why didn't you go
to the police?

02:25.078 --> 02:27.480
Because he told her
I was his son.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.350
He asked me to watch James
for a few days

02:30.383 --> 02:32.118
while he went out of town.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.355
He never came back.

02:35.388 --> 02:36.890
FRUTT: Excuse me.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.759
Chad's picture was all over
the news for weeks.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.027
How could you not have known
he had been kidnapped?

02:41.061 --> 02:43.630
JAMES: She didn't,
and we're not here for you

02:43.664 --> 02:45.465
to cross-examine her
like she's a criminal.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.668
ALLISON:
I never watch television.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.503
I didn't even own one
at the time.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.938
I know that seems hard
to believe, but...

02:53.339 --> 02:55.275
I wasn't hiding him.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.711
You will have to talk
to the police.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.479
FRUTT: And probably talk

02:59.513 --> 03:00.947
to the district attorney
as well.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.549
I know,

03:02.583 --> 03:04.317
and I know I should have
gone to them

03:04.350 --> 03:06.687
18 years ago.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.388
Whatever I did wrong,

03:08.421 --> 03:11.858
I am willing to accept
the consequences.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.095
Now that I realize
who he is

03:15.128 --> 03:17.263
and what the Baldwins
have gone through...

03:19.633 --> 03:21.768
And this is why
you're coming forward?

03:21.802 --> 03:24.805
ALLISON: That, and because
James has the right

03:24.838 --> 03:26.807
to know his birth parents.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.579
Do you even remember
John Pierce?

03:33.413 --> 03:34.848
No, no, I don't even remember

03:34.881 --> 03:37.651
being Chad Baldwin.

03:37.684 --> 03:38.952
And you're really sure
you are?

03:41.888 --> 03:45.559
JAMES: A picture of my mother
with John Pierce.

03:45.592 --> 03:48.061
She always told me
that he was my father,

03:49.796 --> 03:52.766
and then I saw the news,

03:52.799 --> 03:55.135
and he's not my father.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.203
I'm the boy he kidnapped.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.481
(music playing)

04:50.957 --> 04:52.192
RICHARD: Are you sure?

04:52.225 --> 04:54.494
FRUTT:
No, we're not sure.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.597
That's why we need you
to take a blood test.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.364
We've already taken his and--

04:58.398 --> 05:00.233
He thought Pierce
was his father?

05:00.266 --> 05:02.402
Until a few days ago, yes.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.738
And the woman said
she got him from Pierce?

05:04.771 --> 05:07.273
DONNELL:
Yes. Richard, Jenny,

05:07.307 --> 05:10.310
there was a lot of news
coverage on this.

05:10.343 --> 05:11.845
occasionally, there are people

05:11.878 --> 05:13.914
who will try to take advantage
of a situation,

05:13.947 --> 05:16.182
no matter how tragic.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.752
By pretending
to be our son?

05:18.785 --> 05:20.353
FRUTT: We don't know.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.488
You have money.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.758
That's why we want to take
the blood test.

05:25.726 --> 05:26.693
RICHARD: He must think

05:26.727 --> 05:28.161
there's a good chance he's Chad,

05:28.194 --> 05:29.229
or he wouldn't have come.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.231
We're exploring
the possibilities.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.834
When can I see him?

05:33.867 --> 05:35.736
DONNELL: Let us check
things out first.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.571
If he isn't Chad, we don't want
your disappointment

05:37.604 --> 05:39.640
to be any greater
than it has to be.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.875
My wife and I
are very good at dealing

05:41.908 --> 05:43.076
with disappointment.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.779
We've had years of practice.

05:45.812 --> 05:47.147
We don't need you to decide

05:47.180 --> 05:48.749
how much we can take.

05:48.782 --> 05:52.252
We'll do the blood test
and go from there.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.791
Anybody who knows this woman,

05:57.824 --> 05:59.359
knew her, knew somebody
who knows her

05:59.392 --> 06:00.961
we need to support
her testimony.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.763
Otherwise, it will be
her word against Pierce's.

06:02.796 --> 06:03.897
I'm on it.
Lindsay, if you could stay

06:03.930 --> 06:05.065
on the lab.
They've only had

06:05.098 --> 06:06.032
the blood an hour.
They could test it

06:06.066 --> 06:08.802
in 20 minutes
and be 99% sure.

06:08.835 --> 06:09.870
They still in my office?

06:09.903 --> 06:11.371
DOLE: Waiting.
Come on, Ellenor.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.880
Bobby or Eugene here?

06:19.913 --> 06:21.081
Bobby's in a meeting,

06:21.114 --> 06:23.249
but Eugene's in his office.

06:27.253 --> 06:29.055
BERLUTI:
Can I talk to you a second?

06:39.966 --> 06:41.768
I, uh...

06:41.802 --> 06:44.871
I've joined Gamblers Anonymous.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.440
I go to three meetings
a week.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.976
I'm also going
to a regular therapist.

06:50.010 --> 06:54.214
So I feel confident
that I'll be okay.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.617
Good.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.021
I'd like to apologize
to the firm.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.156
I was thinking--
That can't happen.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.358
Rest of the people here
don't even know, Jimmy.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.628
Should they know,
they become obligated by law

07:07.661 --> 07:10.731
to report you.
I guess what I'm saying,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.699
I'm willing to accept it

07:12.733 --> 07:15.068
if that's what anybody
chooses to do.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.271
But nobody will choose to do it.
That's the problem.

07:18.304 --> 07:20.006
They'll keep your secret
and be potentially liable

07:20.040 --> 07:21.074
for doing so.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.143
If you really want
to protect them here,

07:23.176 --> 07:24.678
do not tell.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.780
Okay.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.553
Are we okay?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.054
You and me?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.595
Do I forgive you?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.129
Yes.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.766
Am I here to help you
any way I can?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.801
Maybe.

07:47.834 --> 07:51.638
But are we okay, like
everything's back to normal?

07:51.672 --> 07:52.673
No.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.310
I don't trust you as much.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.983
Well...

08:03.016 --> 08:04.951
that's a pretty big loss.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.120
YOUNG: Yes, it is,

08:07.153 --> 08:08.421
and, Jimmy...

08:09.890 --> 08:11.324
it's not just yours.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.396
That ever occur to you?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.835
DONNELL: The thing is,

08:21.868 --> 08:25.238
The police will want
to talk to you.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.472
Why do they even
have to find out?

08:26.507 --> 08:28.509
If you're really
Chad Baldwin,

08:28.542 --> 08:29.943
it will get out.

08:29.976 --> 08:33.714
A kidnapped child comes back
after 18 years?

08:33.746 --> 08:35.115
This will eventually get out.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.683
And you are going to be
considered a suspect.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.119
You kept the child.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.821
you never contacted
the police.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.256
You will certainly be
considered an accessory.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.091
I thought he was Pierce's son.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.427
FRUTT: Yes,
and assuming that's true,

08:47.460 --> 08:50.130
if you try to be sneaky
about this now,

08:50.163 --> 08:52.298
you will lose all credibility
with the police

08:52.332 --> 08:54.167
when they come
to ask you questions,

08:54.868 --> 08:58.004
and they will come.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.940
So what are you
suggesting we do?

08:59.973 --> 09:02.609
DONNELL: Assuming
you are Chad Baldwin,

09:02.643 --> 09:05.812
I'd like to go to the district
attorney's office.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.280
I think we can make a deal.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.518
I'm hopeful
they'll give you immunity.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.020
And what would I have
to give them?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.856
John Pierce.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.724
You can put him away.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.928
Can you promise
she'll be protected?

09:25.165 --> 09:26.166
No.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.170
Bobby, line 2.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.437
It's the lab.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.407
(music playing)

09:39.479 --> 09:41.815
Bobby Donnell.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.487
Send me the report.

09:47.521 --> 09:49.255
Thank you.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.228
Well, it seems
you're Chad Baldwin.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.506
The blood test
is conclusive.

10:05.539 --> 10:06.807
It's him.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.676
He's your son.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.546
Oh, my god.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.781
We found our son.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.726
When can we see him?

10:25.759 --> 10:28.028
He says he'd like to do it
at the office.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.996
I need to sit down.
I'm shaking.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.871
RICHARD: And this woman
is willing to testify

10:37.904 --> 10:39.272
against Pierce?

10:39.305 --> 10:41.508
We can finally put him
behind bars?

10:41.542 --> 10:43.143
DONNELL: I think she'd like to,

10:43.176 --> 10:44.377
but she could change her mind

10:44.410 --> 10:45.546
and take the fifth.

10:45.579 --> 10:46.780
Why would she do that?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.181
She came forward.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.250
James is afraid

10:50.283 --> 10:52.118
she might be charged
with something.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.754
James?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.622
That's his name.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.060
Here's what we want.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.364
We want our son back,

11:04.397 --> 11:05.365
and we want the man

11:05.398 --> 11:07.467
who kidnapped him punished.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.303
And you're willing
to not punish her?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.138
DONNELL:
I'd like to go to the D. A.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.173
And tell her the two of you

11:13.206 --> 11:14.407
the victims are in favor

11:14.440 --> 11:15.776
of granting Allison Tucker

11:15.809 --> 11:17.844
some kind of immunity.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.313
We could get you
and your son reunited

11:20.346 --> 11:24.150
and put Mr. Pierce
back in prison.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.652
Let's do that.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.530
GAMBLE: 90% of the people
who walk into my office

11:36.563 --> 11:37.898
promising me a conviction

11:37.931 --> 11:39.299
in exchange for immunity

11:39.332 --> 11:41.401
are a lot more involved
than they admit.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.436
And I'll bet
90% of that 90%

11:43.469 --> 11:44.505
are people who know

11:44.538 --> 11:45.706
they're about to be picked up.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.207
Allison Tucker
would have never been

11:47.240 --> 11:48.809
prosecuted on anything.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.111
You're asking me
to make a blind bid.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.279
The Baldwins support it.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.649
If the victims
of the crime

11:55.682 --> 11:57.217
want to give
this woman immunity

11:57.250 --> 11:58.451
and help you convict the man

11:58.484 --> 12:00.486
we both know is responsible,

12:00.521 --> 12:02.589
Helen, where's the downside?

12:02.623 --> 12:04.591
Yeah, I need more.

12:05.491 --> 12:06.860
I'll make a proffer

12:06.893 --> 12:09.129
that she can put John Pierce

12:09.162 --> 12:11.532
with Chad Baldwin in 1983.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.499
You've never had that.

12:13.534 --> 12:16.336
Add that to the existing
circumstantial evidence--

12:16.369 --> 12:18.939
Put them together how?
Is she an eyewitness?

12:18.972 --> 12:20.707
Yes.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.408
On several occasions.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.213
She raised the kid.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.516
If you don't
give her immunity,

12:29.550 --> 12:30.684
you know what will happen.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.218
She'll take the fifth.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.688
Her son will refuse
to testify against her,

12:34.721 --> 12:37.791
and you will be left
with what the blind man saw.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.161
I'll give her
queen for the day.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.696
If I buy her story,

12:42.729 --> 12:45.131
I'll give her accessory
after the fact.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.567
Nice try.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.301
Accessory.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.637
I'll agree to no time
if I buy her story.

12:50.671 --> 12:52.338
If I don't, no deal.

12:57.778 --> 12:58.779
Thank you.

13:01.948 --> 13:02.949
You okay?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.786
Yeah.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.453
It's just kind of
hitting me.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.890
My whole life, I...

13:09.923 --> 13:12.058
I thought my father
was this Pierce man.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.630
Do you have any pictures
of them...

13:16.663 --> 13:17.698
the Baldwins?

13:18.532 --> 13:20.233
I don't think so.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.502
But you've met them.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.136
Yeah.

13:23.169 --> 13:24.938
They seem really nice,

13:24.971 --> 13:26.106
and I...

13:28.809 --> 13:30.777
they've never stopped
loving you.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.014
What does she look like...

13:34.047 --> 13:35.682
my mother?

13:35.716 --> 13:38.451
ALLISON: I'm your mother.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.420
I know, mom.

13:41.922 --> 13:42.723
I-I didn't mean--

13:42.756 --> 13:43.824
No--
I was--

13:43.857 --> 13:46.527
I mean, I'm all for you
meeting them.

13:47.628 --> 13:49.963
I know you raised me.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.798
I know who my mother is.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.673
We need to go.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.682
ALLISON: I was working
in Brockton as a waitress.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.584
One day I was washing
my clothes

14:10.617 --> 14:11.652
at the Laundromat,

14:11.685 --> 14:13.353
and this man came in
with James,

14:13.386 --> 14:14.721
who was about four.

14:14.755 --> 14:15.889
We started talking,

14:15.922 --> 14:18.324
and he said that James
was his son,

14:18.358 --> 14:20.093
and that the mom had died

14:20.126 --> 14:22.295
and that they were
living in a camper.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.697
What year was this?

14:23.730 --> 14:26.800
ALLISON: This was 1983,
early summer.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.503
He said his name
was Chris Stephenson,

14:29.536 --> 14:31.505
but when we saw John Pierce

14:31.538 --> 14:33.974
on the television a week ago,

14:34.007 --> 14:35.942
well, that was the man

14:35.976 --> 14:37.611
who gave me James,

14:37.644 --> 14:40.480
and we figured things out.

14:40.514 --> 14:42.415
Do you recall the name
of the Laundromat?

14:42.448 --> 14:44.685
ALLISON: No, but I think
it was on Crescent,

14:44.718 --> 14:46.386
near the railroad tracks.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.289
How did you end up
with James permanently?

14:49.322 --> 14:51.558
ALLISON: Well, one day
this John Pierce

14:51.592 --> 14:53.259
said that he had to go away

14:53.293 --> 14:54.360
for a few days,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.429
and he asked
if I could watch James,

14:56.462 --> 14:58.131
and I said yes.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.734
How long did this Mr. Pierce
say he'd be gone?

15:00.767 --> 15:02.202
ALLISON: Three, four days.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.004
But then he...

15:05.305 --> 15:07.440
well, he never came back.

15:07.473 --> 15:08.909
Well, when did it occur to you

15:08.942 --> 15:11.377
he might not be
coming back at all?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.679
ALLISON: I don't know.

15:12.713 --> 15:16.650
I suppose a few months later.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.953
I thought about going
to the police,

15:19.986 --> 15:21.955
but I knew that they would
put the boy

15:21.988 --> 15:23.189
in a foster home.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.893
We had bonded,

15:26.927 --> 15:29.062
and I, um...

15:30.831 --> 15:32.132
I-I just didn't want him

15:32.165 --> 15:34.134
to be put in a home.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.704
You remember any of this?

15:37.738 --> 15:39.906
I remember our place
in Springfield,

15:39.940 --> 15:41.908
nothing much
before that.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.816
You believe her?

15:49.850 --> 15:52.018
I don't know.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.419
It's hard to swallow
that she didn't have

15:53.453 --> 15:55.522
some inkling the kid
was kidnapped.

15:55.556 --> 15:57.924
Likelihood is she probably
didn't want to know.

15:58.959 --> 15:59.760
Checked her out?

15:59.793 --> 16:00.994
Her employment history

16:01.027 --> 16:03.363
and the location
of the Laundromat pan out.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.265
No criminal record.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.467
Owns a little
second-hand shop.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.335
Wonderful mother
and neighbor.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.371
Well...

16:11.404 --> 16:13.507
even if she knew,
she still took the kid

16:13.540 --> 16:15.308
out of the hands
of a child molester.

16:15.341 --> 16:16.677
Meaning?

16:16.710 --> 16:19.412
She left the situation
better than she found it.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.947
Well, if she knew
he was kidnapped,

16:20.981 --> 16:22.182
she should have
come forward.

16:22.215 --> 16:26.019
LOWE: Look, our endgame
is to get Pierce.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.821
She can help us do that.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.923
You think I should
make the deal?

16:29.956 --> 16:31.692
She'll plead
to accessory?

16:32.292 --> 16:33.994
No time served.

16:35.629 --> 16:37.698
I think you should make
the deal.

16:38.799 --> 16:40.100
We're in.

16:40.133 --> 16:43.003
You get your immunity
if you testify against Pierce.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.438
JAMES: So, she can't
be prosecuted.

16:45.471 --> 16:46.973
DONNELL: That's right,
but it means going forward

16:47.007 --> 16:49.142
as soon as tomorrow
at the probable cause hearing,

16:49.175 --> 16:51.011
then again, of course,
at trial.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.213
Okay.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.081
DONNELL: But, Allison,

16:55.115 --> 16:56.316
you have to understand...

16:56.349 --> 16:59.620
this is going to be
an ugly battle.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.322
Pierce's attorney
will try to shred you.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.957
She'll go from attacking
your honesty

17:03.990 --> 17:05.491
to suggesting
you're trying to extort

17:05.526 --> 17:06.859
the Baldwins for money.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.563
She could even claim that
you're the real kidnapper.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.464
You're in for a nasty
few months.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.871
Okay.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.406
JAMES: So are they going
to arrest John Pierce?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.075
They're doing that
as we speak.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.881
Bobby, the Baldwins are here.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.884
(music playing)

17:34.154 --> 17:36.557
Would you like us
to leave?

17:37.658 --> 17:38.625
No.

17:38.659 --> 17:39.893
I mean, um...

17:41.161 --> 17:43.163
I don't know.
I mean, it--it's okay.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.430
It's okay.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.069
Show them in.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.434
Chad?

18:22.836 --> 18:23.870
Hello.

18:23.904 --> 18:26.840
(music playing)

18:53.534 --> 18:54.568
Hello, son.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.304
Hi, dad.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.341
(music playing)

19:17.624 --> 19:20.126
I can't believe
this day is here.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.566
Thank you so much

19:25.599 --> 19:28.535
for bringing him back.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.406
(music playing)

19:45.552 --> 19:47.353
Incredibly, it was the publicity

19:47.387 --> 19:49.255
of last week's civil proceeding

19:49.289 --> 19:51.091
that led James Tucker
to conclude

19:51.124 --> 19:52.358
that he, in fact,

19:52.392 --> 19:54.460
is the missing Chad Baldwin.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.129
John Pierce
was arrested last night

19:56.162 --> 19:57.263
without incident.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.431
His probable cause hearing

19:58.464 --> 20:00.366
is scheduled for 9:00.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.269
Anything from Rebecca?

20:03.303 --> 20:04.270
She's still in Brockton.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.305
She should be back
by lunch.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.640
I hope she finds somebody

20:06.673 --> 20:08.308
to support
that woman's story.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.443
You don't think the judge
will believe her?

20:11.712 --> 20:13.179
Don't know.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.659
So you met this man
in the Laundromat

20:25.692 --> 20:27.493
and he introduced you
to a boy he said

20:27.528 --> 20:29.162
was his son James.
Is that correct?

20:29.195 --> 20:30.230
Yes.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.464
GAMBLE: And this boy
is the young man

20:31.497 --> 20:33.166
you now know is the son

20:33.199 --> 20:34.968
of Richard and Jenny Baldwin,

20:35.001 --> 20:37.270
the son that was kidnapped
18 years ago.

20:37.303 --> 20:38.004
That's correct.

20:38.038 --> 20:39.205
And is that man

20:39.239 --> 20:41.041
who introduced you to the boy,

20:41.074 --> 20:43.109
that man that said
James was his son

20:43.143 --> 20:44.945
and asked you to look after him,

20:44.978 --> 20:46.346
is that man in the courtroom?

20:46.379 --> 20:47.347
Yes, he is.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.815
Would you point him out,
please?

20:48.849 --> 20:50.316
The defendant.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.385
She's lying.
Mr. Pierce.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.555
I never had a kid with me.

20:54.588 --> 20:57.023
Mr. Pierce.

20:57.057 --> 20:59.526
GAMBLE: And I show you
this picture, Ms. Tucker.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.694
Can you identify it?

21:00.727 --> 21:02.996
It's a picture of me
and the defendant

21:03.029 --> 21:04.831
taken about 20 years ago.

21:04.865 --> 21:06.366
We were at a carnival
together.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.202
GAMBLE: This was previously
marked and identified.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.204
I offer it now into evidence.

21:11.237 --> 21:12.639
I have nothing further

21:12.673 --> 21:13.840
for the witness, Your Honor,

21:13.874 --> 21:15.141
though I remind the court

21:15.175 --> 21:16.342
that all the testimony

21:16.376 --> 21:18.011
from last week's
civil proceeding

21:18.044 --> 21:19.379
has been entered as recorded

21:19.412 --> 21:20.847
testimony evidence.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.354
LIGHTSTONE: Ms. Tucker,

21:28.388 --> 21:30.223
during the 18 years
you were raising

21:30.256 --> 21:32.593
Chad Baldwin as your own son,

21:32.626 --> 21:33.927
did you ever talk to the police

21:33.960 --> 21:35.195
about the father

21:35.228 --> 21:36.062
who left his son with you

21:36.096 --> 21:37.197
and never returned?

21:37.230 --> 21:38.431
No.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.165
LIGHTSTONE:
Did you talk to anyone

21:39.199 --> 21:41.001
about it in 18 years?

21:41.034 --> 21:42.569
No.

21:42.603 --> 21:44.304
You kept the whole thing
a secret.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.706
Is that a fair statement?

21:45.739 --> 21:47.574
I guess you could say that.

21:47.608 --> 21:49.743
LIGHTSTONE: Did you keep it
a secret because you knew

21:49.776 --> 21:52.378
what you were doing
was illegal?

21:52.412 --> 21:54.414
I know that what I did
was wrong,

21:54.447 --> 21:57.117
and, yes,
it was probably illegal,

21:57.150 --> 21:58.785
but at the time,
I really believed

21:58.819 --> 22:01.655
that what I was doing
was best for James.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.157
LIGHTSTONE: You claim
Mr. Pierce asked you

22:04.190 --> 22:05.959
to watch Chad for a few days

22:05.992 --> 22:07.928
and never returned.
Yes.

22:07.961 --> 22:09.563
LIGHTSTONE: Did you ever tell
any of your fellow workers

22:09.596 --> 22:11.598
at the Golden Cup
why you were quitting?

22:11.632 --> 22:12.599
No.

22:12.633 --> 22:14.000
LIGHTSTONE:
Did anyone ever see you

22:14.034 --> 22:15.602
and Mr. Pierce
and Chad together

22:15.636 --> 22:17.270
in the weeks he was living
in Brockton

22:17.303 --> 22:18.972
before he left town?

22:19.005 --> 22:20.173
I don't know.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.142
You can't recall?
No.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.710
LIGHTSTONE: So if I said,
based on everything

22:23.744 --> 22:25.111
you've told me,

22:25.145 --> 22:27.581
I believed
you had kidnapped Chad.

22:27.614 --> 22:28.982
You really wouldn't have any way

22:29.015 --> 22:30.350
of disproving that,
would you?

22:30.383 --> 22:33.554
I don't know how you prove

22:33.587 --> 22:35.756
that you didn't do something.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.958
LIGHTSTONE: And if I said
I believe you concocted

22:37.991 --> 22:39.459
this whole elaborate story

22:39.492 --> 22:41.227
in order to frame
a convenient dupe

22:41.261 --> 22:43.096
and free yourself
from responsibility

22:43.129 --> 22:45.498
for the illegal acts
you admit you committed--

22:45.532 --> 22:47.801
Objection.
Sustained.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.302
LIGHTSTONE: Ms. Tucker,

22:49.335 --> 22:51.705
are you trying to frame
Mr. Pierce

22:51.738 --> 22:53.674
in order to protect yourself?

22:53.707 --> 22:56.042
If I wanted
to protect myself,

22:56.076 --> 22:57.343
I would have stayed living

22:57.377 --> 22:58.311
the way I've been living

22:58.344 --> 23:00.747
for the past 18 years.

23:00.781 --> 23:03.316
I did this for my son,

23:03.349 --> 23:04.818
because I wanted him to meet

23:04.851 --> 23:06.720
his birth parents,

23:06.753 --> 23:07.954
birth parents

23:07.988 --> 23:10.090
that I didn't even know existed

23:10.123 --> 23:12.025
until a few weeks ago.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.727
LIGHTSTONE: I see.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.761
But before you carried out

23:14.795 --> 23:16.196
this little act of altruism,

23:16.229 --> 23:17.564
you made sure you cut a deal

23:17.598 --> 23:18.965
with the D. A., right?

23:20.133 --> 23:21.935
In exchange for this testimony,

23:21.968 --> 23:22.736
you were promised

23:22.769 --> 23:24.404
you wouldn't serve any time.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.306
Is that true, Ms. Tucker?

23:27.541 --> 23:28.675
Yes.

23:29.743 --> 23:31.444
That's correct.

23:41.755 --> 23:43.023
MELANIE: My sister and I
don't really communicate

23:43.056 --> 23:44.691
much anymore,
Ms. Washington.

23:44.725 --> 23:46.292
I'm just looking...

23:47.761 --> 23:49.863
I need witnesses
to substantiate

23:49.896 --> 23:51.031
what she's telling us.

23:51.064 --> 23:52.699
I don't really know anything.

23:52.733 --> 23:54.535
Did you know she had a child?

23:54.568 --> 23:55.836
Yes.

23:55.869 --> 23:56.803
WASHINGTON:
And did she tell you

23:56.837 --> 23:58.404
she had gotten the boy
from a man?

23:58.438 --> 23:59.973
Yeah, some guy she met
at a Laundromat.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.575
I heard the whole thing.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.143
And did you believe her?

24:03.977 --> 24:05.445
Why wouldn't I?

24:06.346 --> 24:09.115
Ms. Tucker,
I'm Allison's lawyer.

24:09.149 --> 24:11.652
I'm on her side.

24:11.685 --> 24:13.486
I'm just trying to collect
information.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.321
You said it like
you doubt her.

24:15.355 --> 24:18.525
Mr. Pierce's lawyer
will doubt her,

24:18.559 --> 24:20.827
and she'll try
to tear her up.

24:20.861 --> 24:22.328
I need to know whatever ammo

24:22.362 --> 24:24.931
she could possibly dig up.

24:33.206 --> 24:34.374
Can I talk to you?

24:34.407 --> 24:36.076
I thought we did that.

24:36.109 --> 24:37.844
Well, I'd like
to talk again, then.

24:39.079 --> 24:40.180
Go ahead.

24:44.518 --> 24:46.620
I, uh...

24:46.653 --> 24:49.122
I-I can't get it
out of my head

24:49.155 --> 24:51.157
about what you said

24:51.191 --> 24:54.394
about shattering trust,

24:54.427 --> 24:56.396
and, well,

24:56.429 --> 24:58.765
I realized
I was betting money.

24:58.799 --> 25:01.968
I even knew I was betting
the client's money,

25:02.002 --> 25:04.237
and I suppose I knew

25:04.270 --> 25:07.440
I was gambling
with the firm's reputation.

25:07.473 --> 25:10.777
What never really hit me

25:10.811 --> 25:13.113
until you said what you said

25:13.146 --> 25:16.216
was that I was
wagering friendships,

25:16.249 --> 25:17.684
and, uh...

25:17.718 --> 25:19.920
I guess that means...

25:19.953 --> 25:22.222
I was willing to,

25:22.255 --> 25:24.958
but on that,

25:24.991 --> 25:27.794
I wasn't really aware.

25:27.828 --> 25:29.963
I never would have
knowingly done that.

25:31.264 --> 25:32.966
You people here...

25:32.999 --> 25:34.668
you're really
the only thing I have

25:34.701 --> 25:37.871
that truly means
anything to me.

25:43.844 --> 25:46.647
I'm not comfortable
telling people I love them,

25:46.680 --> 25:49.550
and especially other men,

25:49.583 --> 25:52.853
but, uh...

25:52.886 --> 25:55.822
I do love you, Eugene,

25:55.856 --> 25:57.891
and for me to risk...

26:02.729 --> 26:04.330
I'm an addict.

26:13.106 --> 26:16.409
But if I ever needed
the will to lick this,

26:16.442 --> 26:18.444
I got it now,

26:18.478 --> 26:21.114
'cause my friendship with you...

26:22.983 --> 26:23.984
well...

26:25.418 --> 26:27.153
I hope you know what I'm saying.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.076
LIGHTSTONE:
They offered nothing new.

26:50.110 --> 26:51.745
The 18-year-old memory

26:51.778 --> 26:53.580
of an unsubstantiated witness

26:53.614 --> 26:56.282
whose credibility
is highly suspect.

26:56.316 --> 26:58.284
The only thing
she could establish

26:58.318 --> 27:01.021
is that she once briefly
knew my client.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.923
Even if the court were able

27:02.956 --> 27:04.490
to accept her concoction,

27:04.525 --> 27:06.827
you would certainly
have to recognize, Your Honor,

27:06.860 --> 27:08.829
that this newly
discovered evidence

27:08.862 --> 27:11.532
could never satisfy at trial

27:11.565 --> 27:14.568
the burden of guilt
beyond reasonable doubt.

27:14.601 --> 27:15.636
Accordingly,

27:15.669 --> 27:17.904
I ask that my client
be released

27:17.938 --> 27:19.139
and the charges be dismissed,

27:19.172 --> 27:21.808
this time with prejudice.

27:28.081 --> 27:30.383
We already had an eyewitness...

27:30.416 --> 27:32.385
Mrs. Baldwin placing John Pierce

27:32.418 --> 27:33.920
at the scene of the crime

27:33.954 --> 27:36.089
at the exact time of the crime.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.324
We found three Legos inside

27:38.358 --> 27:40.160
Mr. Pierce's apartment.

27:40.193 --> 27:41.494
Chad Baldwin was seen playing

27:41.528 --> 27:43.263
with Legos at the scene.

27:43.296 --> 27:46.432
He has convictions for two
other child molestation--

27:46.466 --> 27:48.201
I'm sorry, those will not
come into evidence.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.603
GAMBLE: I think they will.
They go to pattern.

27:49.636 --> 27:50.737
The prejudicial value alone--

27:50.771 --> 27:52.338
GAMBLE: Civil liberties
are less in style

27:52.372 --> 27:53.874
than they used to be,
I would appreciate

27:53.907 --> 27:54.975
getting to finish my statement

27:55.008 --> 27:57.143
much like she got
to finish hers.

27:57.177 --> 27:58.712
Go ahead.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.714
GAMBLE: In addition
to Mrs. Baldwin

28:00.747 --> 28:03.584
placing Mr. Pierce
within 50 feet of her son

28:03.617 --> 28:05.719
at the time
of the disappearance,

28:05.752 --> 28:07.253
in addition to an informant

28:07.287 --> 28:09.389
who testified that John Pierce

28:09.422 --> 28:11.592
admitted to the abduction,

28:11.625 --> 28:12.926
we now have the testimony

28:12.959 --> 28:14.494
of Allison Tucker,

28:14.528 --> 28:16.396
who says she got Chad Baldwin

28:16.429 --> 28:18.364
from John Pierce.

28:18.398 --> 28:20.166
Let's not forget, Your Honor,

28:20.200 --> 28:22.368
his prior molestation
convictions

28:22.402 --> 28:23.870
will likely come into evidence

28:23.904 --> 28:25.005
as pattern evidence.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.540
All of that will be enough

28:26.573 --> 28:28.742
to satisfy reasonable doubt.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.376
Your Honor, it's unquestionable

28:30.410 --> 28:31.812
that this matter satisfies

28:31.845 --> 28:34.114
the burden of a probable
cause hearing.

28:37.250 --> 28:39.052
I agree.

28:39.085 --> 28:41.354
The defendant is bound over.

28:41.387 --> 28:45.391
Trial date for the first week
of February,

28:45.425 --> 28:46.827
and, Ms. Lightstone,

28:46.860 --> 28:48.562
Ms. Gamble is correct.

28:48.595 --> 28:49.630
There's an excellent chance

28:49.663 --> 28:51.632
the jury will hear
about these other

28:51.665 --> 28:54.167
molestation convictions.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.402
Take your client in a corner.

28:56.436 --> 28:59.039
Tell him he's got a problem.

28:59.072 --> 29:00.507
This court is adjourned.

29:00.541 --> 29:01.575
(gavel bangs)

29:01.608 --> 29:03.544
(spectators applauding)

29:12.085 --> 29:13.053
RICHARD: I can't believe it.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.320
We may finally get him.

29:14.354 --> 29:15.656
Well, I'm going to need you
for trial,

29:15.689 --> 29:17.023
which you heard
will be in February.

29:17.057 --> 29:18.291
JENNY: Okay.
WASHINGTON: Bobby?

29:18.324 --> 29:19.259
Hey, Bec.

29:19.292 --> 29:20.460
WASHINGTON: Have a sec?

29:20.493 --> 29:21.928
Sure.

29:22.596 --> 29:25.331
Listen, before we get
carried away,

29:25.365 --> 29:26.933
I'd like to try
to settle this.

29:26.967 --> 29:28.969
Our leverage is good,
and with the chance

29:29.002 --> 29:30.904
of the other convictions
being suppressed

29:30.937 --> 29:32.639
and there is that chance...

29:32.673 --> 29:34.608
I'd like to get
what we can get now.

29:34.641 --> 29:35.776
How long?

29:35.809 --> 29:38.645
If I could get eight years,
I'd be thrilled.

29:38.679 --> 29:39.913
You okay with that?

29:40.380 --> 29:41.381
I guess.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.684
DONNELL: Allison,

29:43.717 --> 29:45.151
can I talk to you
for a second?

29:54.628 --> 29:56.329
What's up?

29:56.362 --> 29:57.798
This is Rebecca Washington.

29:57.831 --> 29:59.099
She's an attorney
with our firm.

29:59.132 --> 30:00.466
Yeah, I think we've met.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.602
DONNELL: She's been looking
for witnesses

30:01.635 --> 30:04.070
who could perhaps bolster
your testimony.

30:04.104 --> 30:07.574
Today, she spoke
with your sister.

30:08.809 --> 30:10.043
And?

30:10.076 --> 30:13.379
She says three years
before taking in James,

30:13.413 --> 30:14.915
you miscarried.

30:15.549 --> 30:17.751
Two years before that,

30:17.784 --> 30:19.152
you miscarried.

30:20.754 --> 30:22.956
Six months
before taking in James,

30:22.989 --> 30:24.625
you tried to adopt.

30:24.658 --> 30:26.459
You were rejected.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.894
A month later,

30:27.928 --> 30:28.929
you told your sister

30:28.962 --> 30:31.364
you thought about
just going to a hospital

30:31.397 --> 30:33.166
and taking a baby.

30:36.770 --> 30:37.838
She's lying.

30:39.973 --> 30:42.342
Why would she make up
those lies?

30:46.379 --> 30:47.948
She's lying.

30:51.251 --> 30:53.554
Did you kidnap James,
Allison?

30:56.122 --> 30:57.090
No.

30:57.123 --> 30:58.759
DONNELL: Did you get lucky?

30:58.792 --> 31:00.927
John Pierce,
a child molester,

31:00.961 --> 31:03.429
just happened to be
in the area at the time?

31:03.463 --> 31:05.832
He just happened
to be a friend?

31:05.866 --> 31:06.867
Are you the beneficiary

31:06.900 --> 31:08.702
of an incredible coincidence?

31:09.903 --> 31:10.804
No.

31:10.837 --> 31:12.105
You also told your sister

31:12.138 --> 31:13.840
Mr. Pierce
had a juvenile arrest

31:13.874 --> 31:16.009
for molestation.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.612
Juvenile records are sealed,

31:18.645 --> 31:20.514
so how would you know that?

31:20.547 --> 31:22.148
We didn't know that.

31:22.182 --> 31:23.717
Pierce told me. So what?

31:23.750 --> 31:25.485
DONNELL: So what?

31:25.519 --> 31:27.487
It means you had reason to know

31:27.521 --> 31:30.056
he'd make a perfect suspect.

31:31.091 --> 31:33.527
Did you try to frame him,
Allison?

31:33.560 --> 31:35.562
Snatched a kid
where he worked,

31:35.596 --> 31:37.664
planted the Legos
in his apartment?

31:37.698 --> 31:38.565
You had access.

31:40.834 --> 31:43.103
Is that what happened,
Allison?

31:46.006 --> 31:50.043
If I was involved,
Mr. Donnell,

31:50.076 --> 31:53.747
why would I ever
come forward now?

31:56.449 --> 31:59.620
I don't think you really did.

31:59.653 --> 32:01.254
James did...

32:02.689 --> 32:04.591
and you couldn't stop him.

32:07.193 --> 32:09.029
You're mistaken.

32:19.773 --> 32:22.008
The question is,
what do we do now?

32:22.042 --> 32:23.977
Well, if Bec
found this out,

32:24.010 --> 32:25.946
I got to believe
the police will, too.

32:25.979 --> 32:28.815
No. The sister's
not talking to the police.

32:28.849 --> 32:31.618
She spoke to me because
I'm Allison's lawyer.

32:31.652 --> 32:33.620
Which raises another issue,

32:33.654 --> 32:35.355
we're Allison's lawyers.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.624
The conflict of interest
we spoke of before

32:37.658 --> 32:39.359
has reared its ugly head.

32:39.392 --> 32:40.794
Do we tell the Baldwins?

32:40.827 --> 32:41.862
How do we not?

32:41.895 --> 32:42.896
YOUNG: I agree.

32:42.929 --> 32:44.565
We have to tell the Baldwins
and Allison.

32:44.598 --> 32:46.667
DOLE: Wait a second,
Allison could still have

32:46.700 --> 32:47.934
criminal exposure on this

32:47.968 --> 32:49.903
for obstruction of justice
or perjury.

32:49.936 --> 32:50.904
YOUNG: It doesn't matter.

32:50.937 --> 32:52.472
She didn't reveal
the information.

32:52.506 --> 32:53.674
Her sister did.

32:53.707 --> 32:54.575
It's not privileged.

32:54.608 --> 32:55.542
But Eugene, there's--

32:55.576 --> 32:58.178
DONNELL:
I am telling the Baldwins.

32:58.211 --> 33:00.681
What's happening with Pierce?

33:03.049 --> 33:05.051
No.
John.

33:05.085 --> 33:07.353
I didn't do it,
and I won't say I did.

33:07.387 --> 33:09.656
I'd finish listening
before declaring your position,

33:09.690 --> 33:10.791
Mr. Pierce.

33:10.824 --> 33:13.293
LIGHTSTONE: Helen.
This is a one-time-only offer.

33:13.326 --> 33:15.095
You know
the evidence we have.

33:15.128 --> 33:16.763
The judge indicated
he's going to admit

33:16.797 --> 33:17.998
the molestation convictions.

33:18.031 --> 33:19.600
I didn't do it.

33:19.633 --> 33:21.001
I admit I knew the woman,

33:21.034 --> 33:23.570
but I never took the kid.

33:23.604 --> 33:26.239
She must have,
and she's trying to frame me.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.308
She's trying to frame you
18 years later.

33:28.341 --> 33:29.910
What is this, careful planning?

33:29.943 --> 33:32.112
I don't know what's going on.

33:32.145 --> 33:33.514
I was friends with her,

33:33.547 --> 33:35.682
but I never grabbed that kid.

33:36.316 --> 33:38.151
You've got till noon tomorrow.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.220
I'm offering you
reckless endangerment

33:40.253 --> 33:41.522
for a kidnapping.

33:41.555 --> 33:42.455
That is a gift,

33:42.488 --> 33:44.124
which I am willing to give you

33:44.157 --> 33:45.358
to spare putting those families

33:45.391 --> 33:46.593
through a trial.

33:46.627 --> 33:48.428
LOWE: And I hope
you turn it down,

33:48.461 --> 33:50.430
'cause I love to go after guys

33:50.463 --> 33:51.632
who go after kids.

33:56.336 --> 33:57.571
She did it?

33:57.604 --> 33:59.673
We can't prove it,

33:59.706 --> 34:01.074
but we think so.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.911
Does James know?

34:04.945 --> 34:06.179
FRUTT: We don't think so.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.147
He seems to believe

34:07.180 --> 34:08.748
his mother's version
of the events.

34:12.085 --> 34:13.520
So where does this
leave us?

34:13.554 --> 34:15.487
Well...
DONNELL: Ethically,

34:15.522 --> 34:18.525
we think we should inform
the district attorney.

34:18.559 --> 34:20.025
We're a little trapped
because Allison

34:20.060 --> 34:22.094
is also our client.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.630
Before we do anything,

34:23.664 --> 34:25.599
we thought we'd get
your reaction to it all.

34:27.734 --> 34:30.504
Why would she come forward
and expose herself

34:30.536 --> 34:32.072
if she were the kidnapper?

34:32.105 --> 34:34.474
DONNELL: We believe James
insisted on coming forward,

34:34.507 --> 34:37.578
and she couldn't
talk him out of it.

34:37.610 --> 34:40.547
FRUTT: As we said,
we can't prove any of it,

34:40.581 --> 34:43.483
but this is where we are.

34:44.317 --> 34:45.619
I would like you to not

34:45.652 --> 34:47.487
tell the district attorney.

34:49.822 --> 34:50.791
Okay.

34:51.891 --> 34:52.859
Why?

34:52.893 --> 34:55.762
Because if you do,

34:55.795 --> 34:57.631
it's going to turn Chad
against you,

34:57.664 --> 35:00.200
and ultimately us.

35:00.233 --> 35:01.501
Like it or not,

35:03.103 --> 35:04.871
she controls our relationship

35:04.905 --> 35:07.273
with our son.

35:07.307 --> 35:09.075
A man stands to be convicted

35:09.109 --> 35:10.911
for a crime he didn't commit.

35:10.944 --> 35:13.379
Well, maybe the police
will find this new information

35:13.413 --> 35:14.447
out on their own.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.415
FRUTT:
That doesn't seem likely,

35:15.448 --> 35:17.217
and besides,

35:17.250 --> 35:19.252
Pierce could enter a plea.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.155
JENNY: Ellenor, Bobby...

35:22.188 --> 35:24.424
my husband's right.

35:24.457 --> 35:25.692
We need to have a relationship

35:25.726 --> 35:27.227
with this woman.

35:27.260 --> 35:28.428
It's possible,

35:28.461 --> 35:31.497
if James were to know that
Allison was the kidnapper,

35:31.532 --> 35:33.299
he might sever
his relationship with her,

35:33.333 --> 35:34.968
making it easier for you.

35:35.001 --> 35:36.069
RICHARD: That might be so,

35:36.102 --> 35:38.104
if you could prove it,

35:38.138 --> 35:39.706
but you can't.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.278
You asked for our
thoughts, Bobby.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.681
As your clients,
we're directing you

35:47.714 --> 35:49.382
not to tell
the district attorney

35:49.415 --> 35:51.552
about this new information.

35:56.590 --> 35:58.959
He maintains his innocence.

35:58.992 --> 36:00.460
Come on, Henrietta.

36:00.493 --> 36:02.062
He does. Helen,
what can I tell you?

36:02.095 --> 36:03.496
It's not about
what you tell me.

36:03.530 --> 36:04.831
It's about
what you say to him.

36:04.865 --> 36:07.167
You got to advise him
of his legal chances here.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.135
If this goes to trial,
he's dead.

36:09.169 --> 36:10.804
I can't make him
take a deal.

36:10.837 --> 36:12.338
Make him see reality.

36:14.207 --> 36:16.009
Give me something
to go back with.

36:16.042 --> 36:18.478
I gave you eight years
for a kidnapping.

36:18.512 --> 36:20.280
What do you want me,
to gift-wrap it?

36:20.313 --> 36:22.516
Make it six.
I'll get him there.

36:22.549 --> 36:25.085
I'll give him 15 in juvie.
He'll love it.

36:26.587 --> 36:28.188
Six.

36:28.221 --> 36:29.122
I'll sell it.

36:29.155 --> 36:31.625
Seven. Sell seven.

36:34.628 --> 36:36.697
DONNELL: Lucy, notify
the Baldwins and the Tuckers

36:36.730 --> 36:38.565
we're going back in
before judge Kenney at 11:00

36:38.599 --> 36:39.600
if they want to be there.

36:39.633 --> 36:41.267
Do they have to?
No, it's their choice.

36:41.301 --> 36:42.969
I'm going. Ellenor?

36:43.003 --> 36:44.270
I'm with you.

36:49.510 --> 36:51.211
So this guy's going back
to prison.

36:52.646 --> 36:53.714
Seems so.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.160
Jimmy.

37:07.193 --> 37:09.295
Lunch plans.

37:09.763 --> 37:10.731
Me?

37:10.764 --> 37:13.299
No, I'm wide open.

37:13.333 --> 37:15.435
Want to grab a sandwich,
12:30 or so?

37:16.537 --> 37:17.638
Great.

37:31.852 --> 37:33.887
Bobby.
You're here.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.421
We were close
when Lucy called.

37:35.455 --> 37:36.723
The case is over?

37:36.757 --> 37:39.425
They supposedly
have reached a deal.

37:39.459 --> 37:41.127
There's a joint
recommendation scheduled

37:41.161 --> 37:42.763
before Judge Kenney.

37:43.697 --> 37:45.231
Listen, I know we've already
discussed this,

37:45.265 --> 37:48.735
but I'm going to say it again.

37:48.769 --> 37:50.436
If Pierce is doing jail time,

37:50.470 --> 37:51.872
he's serving it quite possibly

37:51.905 --> 37:53.874
for a crime he didn't commit.

37:55.475 --> 37:57.944
Will you really be able
to live with that?

38:00.413 --> 38:02.883
John Pierce is a two-time
child molester,

38:02.916 --> 38:04.951
whether or not he actually
kidnapped Chad.

38:04.985 --> 38:07.153
He served his time
for those offenses.

38:07.187 --> 38:09.455
JENNY: I'm not going
to lose sleep for him.

38:09.489 --> 38:11.124
This is my time to make up

38:11.157 --> 38:14.027
for 18 lost years
with my son.

38:21.835 --> 38:23.003
Is it really over?

38:23.036 --> 38:24.905
We don't know.

38:24.938 --> 38:27.240
We're told there's a plea.

38:27.273 --> 38:30.176
Allison, could I see you
in private

38:30.210 --> 38:30.944
in the witness room?

38:30.977 --> 38:32.646
I'll go with you.

38:32.679 --> 38:34.114
No, this is private,
Bobby.

38:34.147 --> 38:36.416
I'm going with you.

38:48.194 --> 38:50.531
Did you kidnap
my son, Allison?

38:53.166 --> 38:54.300
I asked you a question,

38:54.334 --> 38:56.069
and I would appreciate
an answer.

38:57.871 --> 39:00.306
Did you kidnap my son?

39:01.107 --> 39:04.678
I raised James.

39:04.711 --> 39:07.213
I'm his mother.

39:07.247 --> 39:10.283
Well, then, as his mother,

39:10.316 --> 39:13.419
you'll understand my rage

39:13.453 --> 39:15.455
like only a mother can.

39:19.560 --> 39:21.194
I will get along with you

39:21.227 --> 39:22.829
because I have to.

39:24.030 --> 39:26.132
I will welcome you
into my home.

39:26.166 --> 39:29.269
I will sit across
a dinner table from you.

39:30.403 --> 39:33.439
I will welcome you into my life

39:33.473 --> 39:35.742
to keep James in my life.

39:37.277 --> 39:39.613
But with every embrace,

39:39.646 --> 39:42.215
please know...

39:42.248 --> 39:43.416
I will never,

39:43.449 --> 39:46.587
ever forgive you.

39:50.123 --> 39:52.626
And you'll understand that,
won't you?

39:53.226 --> 39:55.495
Because a mother can understand.

40:04.738 --> 40:06.039
Court's in session.

40:09.409 --> 40:11.011
DONNELL: Let's go.

40:17.450 --> 40:18.719
KENNEY: You understand,
Mr. Pierce,

40:18.752 --> 40:20.353
that you are pleading guilty

40:20.386 --> 40:23.389
to the charge
of child endangerment?

40:23.423 --> 40:25.491
Yes, Your Honor.

40:25.526 --> 40:26.226
And you understand

40:26.259 --> 40:28.529
that by pleading guilty,

40:28.562 --> 40:30.130
you waive your rights
to an appeal

40:30.163 --> 40:32.065
and will be sentenced
to state prison

40:32.098 --> 40:34.234
for a term of not less
than seven years?

40:36.703 --> 40:39.205
Mr. Pierce,
I asked you a question.

40:44.244 --> 40:47.347
Yes, Your Honor,
I understand it all.

40:47.380 --> 40:49.049
Ms. Lightstone,

40:49.082 --> 40:52.018
you support and recommend
this plea?

40:52.052 --> 40:53.687
I do, Your Honor.

40:53.720 --> 40:54.721
KENNEY: All right, then,

40:54.755 --> 40:57.524
the plea is entered
and accepted.

40:57.558 --> 41:00.226
Mr. Pierce, you are hereby
found guilty

41:00.260 --> 41:04.364
of the charge
of child endangerment.

41:04.397 --> 41:06.499
Security, take Mr. Pierce
into custody.

41:08.101 --> 41:09.202
This court is adjourned.

41:09.235 --> 41:11.037
(gavel bangs)

41:11.071 --> 41:13.874
(music playing)

42:05.759 --> 42:08.695
(music playing)

42:32.152 --> 42:33.219
WOMAN: You stinker!
