00:09.096 --> 00:11.837
<i>- Two trains,</i>
<i>two chapters to tell.</i>

00:15.102 --> 00:16.929
<i>One runs hot and fast.</i>

00:21.369 --> 00:22.892
<i>The other lumbers slow...</i>

00:25.460 --> 00:27.375
<i>Cold-cast in Wilford's</i>
<i>iron grip...</i>

00:29.638 --> 00:31.944
<i>An armored tortoise</i>
<i>plodding after a hare...</i>

00:33.468 --> 00:34.991
<i>Everyone under</i>
<i>a single thumb...</i>

00:36.688 --> 00:38.342
<i>Serving a single obsession...</i>

00:40.605 --> 00:43.869
<i>To retake the pirates</i>
<i>and exact his revenge.</i>

00:45.132 --> 00:46.263
I can smell them.

00:47.308 --> 00:50.572
Layton took my engine
through here

00:50.615 --> 00:52.008
about a month ago,

00:52.052 --> 00:54.576
judging by the ice buildup.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.057
Practically on their heels.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.059
You see?

00:59.102 --> 01:01.017
Like old footprints
in the snow.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.542
Set switch for the south fork,
Engineer.

01:04.586 --> 01:07.371
We'll get it back, Jupe,

01:07.415 --> 01:09.112
whatever it takes.

02:05.516 --> 02:07.388
<i>- Inside,</i>
<i>it's a backwards world.</i>

02:08.345 --> 02:11.131
<i>Only one class now,</i>

02:11.174 --> 02:14.482
<i>the working class,</i>
<i>freezing, stitching,</i>

02:14.525 --> 02:17.311
<i>fixing, suffering.</i>

02:33.109 --> 02:34.980
- Hey, this isn't
a pass-through.

02:43.772 --> 02:46.296
- Winnipeg.
- Message for the top.

02:53.042 --> 02:55.131
<i>- But frostbitten fingers</i>
<i>hold fast.</i>

02:56.872 --> 02:58.743
<i>Deep in the iced-over bowels</i>

02:58.787 --> 03:00.267
<i>where Wilford never treads...</i>

03:03.270 --> 03:05.968
<i>A spark still lives:</i>

03:06.011 --> 03:09.189
<i>the resistance,</i>
<i>nurtured and protected</i>

03:09.232 --> 03:11.103
<i>by the bravest of the brave.</i>

03:16.805 --> 03:18.807
- Message for the tippity-top.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.680
- I didn't hear the password,
Mr. Pike.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.247
I expect more
from my second in command.

03:25.683 --> 03:28.033
They picked up sign
of Snowpiercer.

03:28.077 --> 03:30.645
We turned south,
back on the main line.

03:30.688 --> 03:33.561
Oh, thank God for that.

03:33.604 --> 03:35.911
This is the first proof

03:35.954 --> 03:39.393
we've had that they are
still alive in 32 days.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.395
They must--they must have
their reasons

03:41.438 --> 03:42.613
for all this traipsing about.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.049
I mean, if Melanie's aboard--

03:45.094 --> 03:46.182
We don't know.

03:48.358 --> 03:52.275
- You ever think, Ruth,
all alone down here at night,

03:52.319 --> 03:54.799
that since Layton bailed on us
in the first place,

03:54.843 --> 03:56.453
he might never come back?

03:57.846 --> 04:00.414
No, I don't.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.198
And neither do you,
or you wouldn't be

04:02.242 --> 04:03.808
- in the resistance.

04:03.852 --> 04:07.421
- So antibiotics
for the seamstresses.

04:07.464 --> 04:10.206
They'll need them, all jammed
up together in that sweatshop.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.468
- Uh-huh.
- It's these little things

04:11.512 --> 04:13.296
that will keep us sane,
Mr. Pike.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.558
The passengers can survive
all of this

04:14.602 --> 04:16.038
if we can ease their journey.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.520
And keep them ready
for Mr. Layton's return.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.437
<i>- The heart of hope</i>
<i>still beats</i>

04:23.480 --> 04:26.222
<i>aboard Wilford's</i>
<i>rolling gulag,</i>

04:26.266 --> 04:28.703
<i>1,023 cars long.</i>

05:04.739 --> 05:06.175
Okay.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.612
Should be clear
of track contaminants.

05:08.656 --> 05:11.180
I'm gonna start
pulling ice samples.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.573
How's it looking?

05:12.616 --> 05:14.575
<i>- Palm trees,</i>
<i>golden sands.</i>

05:14.618 --> 05:17.055
<i>Gotta catch me</i>
<i>some North Korean waves.</i>

05:17.099 --> 05:19.406
- Nice. I'll grab my board.
I'll be right out, bro.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.798
- Let him focus.
- I'm keeping him calm.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.452
You're distracting him.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.062
- Ben, the suit's
at 22 minutes.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.107
Your heart rate's good.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.543
<i>You steady on, okay?</i>

05:26.587 --> 05:27.805
Copy that.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.556
Engine any happier?

05:39.600 --> 05:41.428
- We're venting,
but still too hot.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.996
How's it looking?

05:45.040 --> 05:47.608
Oh, minus 86.

05:47.651 --> 05:50.088
Oh, well, I'm sure glad
we came all this way.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.003
- Well, don't mistake
the weather for the climate.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.397
Ben's samples will show us
the full picture.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.094
We're looking for trends.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.835
- I thought we were looking
for a place to live.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.097
The model likes this spot.

05:59.141 --> 06:00.272
Let's just wait
for the results.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.013
Oh, the model.

06:02.057 --> 06:04.842
- Hey, Till, remember how much
the model liked Sulawesi?

06:04.886 --> 06:06.540
Yeah, I do.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.889
Six months of going
around the world

06:07.932 --> 06:09.369
with nothing to show for it.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.848
- And we learned something
from every stop.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.197
Think of them
as data points.

06:12.241 --> 06:13.895
- Okay, Professor Layton.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.679
- They were not
frozen hellscapes.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.725
They were data points.

06:17.768 --> 06:18.856
Correct.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.390
Shit.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.132
- I need to talk to him.
- Okay.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.179
- Ben, we just blew
a thermal switch

06:37.222 --> 06:38.746
on the main line.

06:38.789 --> 06:41.009
<i>- It's gotta be an error.</i>
- It isn't.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.837
<i>We came in too rich.</i>
<i>I told you that.</i>

06:42.880 --> 06:45.013
- Just discharge
the excess, Alex.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.188
<i>She'll rebalance.</i>

06:46.231 --> 06:47.494
If I discharge any more,

06:47.537 --> 06:49.583
we won't be able
to get going again.

06:49.626 --> 06:52.020
We have to abort.
Pull him in.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.630
<i>She's wrong, Layton.</i>

06:53.674 --> 06:56.459
<i>She can ride the levels.</i>
<i>Ten more minutes.</i>

06:56.503 --> 06:58.853
- We're burning up.
We need to go right now.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.464
Do what you can.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.598
- I told him
we came in too rich.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.208
Okay.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.864
Everything's under control.

07:09.907 --> 07:12.388
- Ben, just stay on task.
Okay?

07:30.928 --> 07:32.147
Hey.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.453
She touchy this morning?

07:33.496 --> 07:35.455
- Scathing.
So mean.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.414
- Sykes is on her way.
- Great.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.244
Why have we stopped again?

07:43.985 --> 07:45.334
You know, they're not gonna
find an oasis.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.423
- You know that.
- I don't know anything.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.772
It's easier that way.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.948
- Ugh, know no one,
feel nothing.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.602
You're a woman alone,
my jailer.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.082
Well, at least I got you.

07:55.562 --> 07:56.519
You gonna be civil,
or do you want me

07:56.563 --> 07:57.825
to feed you in there?

07:59.130 --> 08:00.175
- Mm-mm.
- Monsters first.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.568
- No, please.
- No.

08:01.611 --> 08:06.529
- Okay.
Today's dwindling selection.

08:06.573 --> 08:10.054
We have the boeuf bourguignon,
the carbonara,

08:10.098 --> 08:12.448
the dreaded
chicken mushroom bag,

08:12.492 --> 08:14.929
and the last Thai vegetable.

08:14.972 --> 08:17.453
- You seem to enjoy
working for these pirates.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.021
- Just a POW doing my time,
Audrey.

08:20.064 --> 08:22.284
- Well, he'd be disgusted
with your cooperation.

08:22.327 --> 08:23.938
Can you please?

08:23.981 --> 08:25.505
- If nobody wants
the Thai vegetable...

08:25.548 --> 08:27.550
- Just give me
the carbonara, Martin.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.465
Carbonara, it's the worst.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.556
<i>- Ben?</i>

08:33.600 --> 08:35.210
<i>Ben, the wind's picking up.</i>

08:35.253 --> 08:36.690
<i>It looks like there's</i>
<i>a front coming in.</i>

08:36.733 --> 08:38.822
<i>- Copy that.</i>
<i>I'm on my way back.</i>

08:38.866 --> 08:40.737
- <i>How's Alex?</i>
- Alex, status.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.347
We're not actively on fire.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.698
Tell him to hurry.

08:44.741 --> 08:48.092
- She says she took your advice
and everything's working out.

08:48.136 --> 08:49.964
- Uh-huh.

08:50.007 --> 08:52.096
So much blown snow.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.881
A lot of wind comes
through this basin.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.360
- Well, that's good,
though, right?

08:55.404 --> 08:57.014
<i>Could be.</i>

08:57.058 --> 08:59.800
Might be our warm spot
stirring things up.

09:15.642 --> 09:16.730
Whoa!

09:20.560 --> 09:21.691
- Ben.
- Ben?

09:21.735 --> 09:24.172
- Ben.
- Ben, come in, Ben.

09:24.215 --> 09:26.304
- I can't see him.
- Ben.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.829
- Ben!
Ben, do you copy?

09:28.872 --> 09:30.395
Ben.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.402
<i>Ben, come in.</i>

09:37.446 --> 09:39.143
<i>Ben, your sig--</i>

09:41.189 --> 09:43.844
<i>Ben--</i>

09:45.454 --> 09:47.935
<i>- Ben, the signal--</i>

09:51.982 --> 09:53.636
The bit I don't get, Bess,

09:53.680 --> 09:54.985
when we return to Wilford

09:55.029 --> 09:56.552
with your precious
climate model,

09:56.596 --> 09:58.032
what happens then?

09:58.075 --> 09:59.337
Negotiations.

09:59.381 --> 10:00.861
Both trains
want to reconnect.

10:00.904 --> 10:03.472
- Yeah.
Hostage negotiations first.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.126
You for Zarah.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.737
- Yeah, but then what?

10:07.781 --> 10:10.348
- Wilford's 2,700
to your 7?

10:10.392 --> 10:13.134
He's not gonna take too kindly
to a traitor and a stowaway.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.570
How am I a stowaway?

10:14.614 --> 10:15.702
I woke up from a nap
in my carriage

10:15.745 --> 10:17.138
and the train was gone,

10:17.181 --> 10:19.401
along with my husband
and my twin boys.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.707
Till here.

10:20.750 --> 10:21.882
- Yeah, I need you
to lock them down

10:21.925 --> 10:23.535
- and get up here.
- What's up?

10:23.579 --> 10:24.667
<i>- Nothing they need</i>
<i>to know about.</i>

10:24.711 --> 10:26.103
- All right.
On my way.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.931
Ben, do you read?

10:27.975 --> 10:28.932
All right, that's lunch.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.630
Martin, lock her up.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.240
- Is something wrong?
- Move, go.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.681
- Hey, I saw Ben
going outside earlier.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.727
- Do you need help?
- No, everything's good.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.250
We're good.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.469
On it.

10:44.513 --> 10:47.516
- Till.
Hey, what's going on?

10:47.559 --> 10:49.431
You stay in your quarters.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.476
Wait till the engine
gives the all-clear.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.305
- That's it?
- Yep.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.143
I'm going out there.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.492
- No, you're not.
I'm going.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.190
- Neither of you
are going anywhere.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.713
We can't stay here.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.280
Ben.
Ben, do you copy?

11:12.323 --> 11:13.847
We are not leaving him.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.500
- Layton, if we don't
get rolling right now,

11:15.544 --> 11:16.501
we will melt down.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.329
How long do you need?

11:18.373 --> 11:20.070
- 8 minutes
to get up to speed,

11:20.114 --> 11:22.116
10 to 12 minutes
to run a discharge sequence.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.421
- Great. Go.
- Whoa, whoa.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.814
And leave you outside?

11:24.858 --> 11:25.946
- The breach suits
have 30 minutes.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.512
You go, you come back for me.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.471
- You are staying here.
- Yeah. Like, hell I am.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.520
It's not a discussion, Josie.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.000
If all three of us
get in trouble out there,

11:37.044 --> 11:38.698
there's no one left
for off-train work.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.656
- Yeah, well, I'll make sure
that doesn't happen.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.615
- You know, one time,
just for a change of pace,

11:43.659 --> 11:45.922
you could respect
the chain of command.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.924
Chain of command?

11:47.968 --> 11:49.534
Layton, this isn't
a battleship.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.014
It's a bloody life raft.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.189
And you're staying on it.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.456
- Ben shouldn't even be
out there.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.719
- He knew what
he was getting into.

11:59.762 --> 12:01.546
- Yeah.
Chasing Melanie's ghost.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.548
Her theory.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.812
We all agreed.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.683
We find New Eden, then we go
back for the others.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.033
- And what if there is
no New Eden?

12:10.077 --> 12:11.382
What if she's wrong?

12:14.298 --> 12:16.344
Guess we just all go down
with her, eh?

12:19.869 --> 12:21.784
- Till, you're gonna have
to pilot us out of here.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.177
- Me? Why?

12:23.220 --> 12:24.961
- Because I need
to go deal with that.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.529
- What?
Oh, Jesus.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.705
Jesus.
Yeah, okay.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.881
I--I got it.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.026
- You're starting to believe
your own hype.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.810
You do know that,
don't you?

12:47.854 --> 12:49.725
- I'm just trying to keep
everyone alive.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.379
Yep. We know.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.946
Our great savior.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.556
Never my words.

12:54.599 --> 12:55.818
- I was there
at the beginning in The Tail,

12:55.862 --> 12:57.559
in the muck and the shit.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.169
I know who you are.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.041
- You encouraged me
to be a leader.

13:01.084 --> 13:04.871
- Not for this.
Didn't ask for any of this.

13:08.309 --> 13:09.440
<i>- Engine,</i>
<i>we're at the bay door.</i>

13:09.484 --> 13:10.833
<i>Release the safety.</i>

13:12.008 --> 13:13.836
Uh, copy.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.403
Bay door safety?

13:15.446 --> 13:17.057
System panel, top right.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.777
Josie, be careful.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.737
- Yeah.
Yeah, you too.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.972
You see anything?

14:03.016 --> 14:04.887
We're on the wrong side.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.323
Well, we've been stopped

14:06.367 --> 14:07.934
for an awfully long time,
haven't we?

14:11.241 --> 14:12.460
<i>Engine, we're clear.</i>

14:12.503 --> 14:13.678
- Okay.
Copy.

14:13.722 --> 14:14.854
They're clear!

14:14.897 --> 14:16.681
- Okay.
Take us up to 20.

14:21.686 --> 14:24.211
- Easy!
Easy.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.590
- This is the general
consolidated ledger.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.984
And you can see
where the quartermaster

14:58.027 --> 15:00.508
detected pilfering.

15:00.551 --> 15:03.206
- Cleverly dispersed
along the supply chain.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.426
- Laytonites,
or what's left of them.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.863
- Yeah.
Someone's playing Robin Hood.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.912
Zarah. Zarah.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.261
How are you feeling?

15:14.304 --> 15:15.653
Enormous.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.133
- I'm fine, thank you.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.961
Oh, good.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.224
- I have
the engineering report, Javi.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.617
- I'll take that.
- Ah-ah-ah.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.401
Let's hear it from her.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.534
I appreciate how you deliver
bad news, Zarah.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.405
Always a clear-eyed view.

15:29.972 --> 15:34.585
- So, then, your water pipes
are still frozen.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.674
Most of Second
and parts of Third.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.894
And Ag-Sec output
is down again,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.113
but only by 6% this week.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.636
- This is pilfering.
I was--

15:41.679 --> 15:44.073
- And last night,
43 sleepers and The Chains

15:44.117 --> 15:45.901
lost heat completely.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.556
162 passengers
remain evacuated.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.558
- Well, if we can't keep
them all warm at once,

15:50.601 --> 15:52.995
they'll just have to be
miserable in shifts.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.692
We'll cut First Class.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.433
Out of the question.

15:56.477 --> 15:57.782
- Well, you did
decommission it, Joseph.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.436
It's empty and frozen.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.177
- Cut the weight.
- I will restore First to glory

16:01.221 --> 16:03.310
when I get my engine back--
and Audrey with it.

16:03.353 --> 16:06.835
- Perhaps there's another way
to conserve energy.

16:06.878 --> 16:09.142
- Like a cull.
- No, Kevin, you ghoul.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.752
- Please berate him.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.101
Remind him there are rules.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.363
Sorry to disappoint, Kevin.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.017
But minus an arm or two,

16:15.061 --> 16:16.932
we keep everyone
as alive as possible

16:16.976 --> 16:19.935
so Audrey stays as alive
as possible.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.155
- Of course.
- And you too, my dear.

16:23.721 --> 16:27.116
- That's been guaranteed,
hasn't it?

16:30.598 --> 16:32.252
Bye, Javi.

16:34.558 --> 16:35.733
- Rules.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.215
The resistance is not
so constrained.

16:39.259 --> 16:42.088
Every game has rules, Kevin.

16:42.131 --> 16:43.306
Get creative.

17:14.163 --> 17:15.730
Let go!

17:21.953 --> 17:23.781
Jackboot Tyson.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.609
- Can you get me
out of compost or not?

17:25.653 --> 17:27.220
One more week.

17:27.263 --> 17:30.179
But in the meantime,
how about a nice hot bath?

17:31.354 --> 17:32.573
You taking the piss?

17:32.616 --> 17:34.140
Nah, ooh.

17:34.183 --> 17:38.231
Bathing token for services
to the cause.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.803
- What can we do
for you, Kevin?

17:45.847 --> 17:48.197
- Hmm.
Ovaltine.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.677
Yeah, we don't have Ovaltine.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.201
We have train-made hooch.

17:52.245 --> 17:55.291
- Fine.
One hooch.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.990
Mr. Wilford loves what you've
done with the place,

17:59.034 --> 18:02.342
but I'm afraid he needs
just a smidge more

18:02.385 --> 18:03.473
from the deal.

18:03.517 --> 18:04.605
Information?

18:07.912 --> 18:12.613
- The subversives continue
filching and currying favor

18:12.656 --> 18:15.572
while their shot caller keeps
slipping through our fingers.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.705
We would like
this person identified

18:17.748 --> 18:20.882
and captured... now.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.756
- Maybe our passed-out Jack
knows something.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.847
Jackboot Whiggins?

18:29.891 --> 18:32.459
Oi, Stuie.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.287
Wake up, Whiggins.

18:34.330 --> 18:39.292
- What?
You said I could stay. Oh!

18:39.335 --> 18:40.902
- They put you
on Water Security, yeah?

18:40.945 --> 18:42.643
Yes.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.340
- You're a former Firstie,
so you'll be glad to help.

18:44.384 --> 18:47.648
- Well, what's happening
in Water Security?

18:49.302 --> 18:51.869
Uh, you know, nothing.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.003
Yeah.

18:55.046 --> 18:57.919
Um, well,

18:57.962 --> 19:00.574
you know, very little.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.793
Kevin doesn't need much.

19:02.837 --> 19:05.622
- Just a little thread to pick.
Come on.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.363
Ugh.

19:07.407 --> 19:10.540
- Well, I've heard that
the Second Class Watermaster

19:10.584 --> 19:14.240
was giving away hot baths

19:14.283 --> 19:15.937
for service
to the resistance.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.202
Let's have a look.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.425
Oh, that's healing nicely.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.209
Have you applied
your cream today?

19:28.602 --> 19:30.604
- No, sir.
- Well, then allow me.

19:37.437 --> 19:40.179
Oh, it's all right, cub.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.964
It's all right.
You like me now.

19:43.007 --> 19:46.054
This business with Jupiter.

19:46.097 --> 19:49.318
I know she's
a blunt tool, Javier.

19:49.362 --> 19:54.280
But when you're one man
responsible for nearly 3,000...

19:55.759 --> 19:58.109
It's not enough
being a disciplinarian.

19:58.153 --> 20:01.156
You need to add
a little chaos to the mix.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.810
In here, it's Jupiter.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.768
Out there, it's Kevin,
gnashing his teeth

20:04.812 --> 20:06.509
and running amok.

20:07.989 --> 20:10.383
You can't fight
the unpredictable, Javier.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.951
That's how
I keep everyone safe.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.171
Anyway...

20:16.215 --> 20:18.173
I hope you see it
for what it is.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.352
I do need you, Javier.

20:29.924 --> 20:32.274
Good man.

20:36.713 --> 20:37.888
Wilford.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.977
<i>Sir, we have a lead.</i>

20:58.648 --> 21:00.084
Stand up, stand up.

21:01.956 --> 21:04.828
Watermaster Arnoldo Reyas.

21:06.917 --> 21:10.704
<i>- Sí, señor.</i>
The Engine will provide.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.364
Clean as a baby.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.288
Come on.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.942
Come on out
before you get cold.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.168
- The Watermaster told them
where we are.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.692
- Gotta go.
- Again.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.050
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.313
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.315
- There you go,
that's it.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.881
- Oh.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.274
Ruth, let's go, quick.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.362
Quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick.

22:00.406 --> 22:01.972
- All right.
All right.

22:02.016 --> 22:04.105
We can't all be built
like a bloody whippet.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.507
Come on. Come on.

22:18.249 --> 22:19.903
That's full! Set it down!

22:19.947 --> 22:21.557
We gotta go!

22:30.697 --> 22:31.785
- Let's go.
Let's go!

22:57.158 --> 22:58.551
End of the line.

22:58.594 --> 23:01.554
The First is too frozen
for the subtrain.

23:01.597 --> 23:05.340
Okay.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.169
Oh.

23:08.212 --> 23:11.128
Crikey, it's cold.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.957
Just wait.

23:24.228 --> 23:28.450
- They were here.
Right under our noses.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.234
Treachery.

23:31.801 --> 23:35.283
- Who are you,
you clever thing?

23:36.502 --> 23:40.984
- They got it on trickle,
stays around minus 25.

23:41.028 --> 23:42.464
I'm hoping they won't
look back here,

23:42.508 --> 23:45.511
because, you know,
it's too cold to live.

23:55.085 --> 23:57.784
Oh, my God.

23:57.827 --> 24:00.917
What, Kevin couldn't put
anything away?

24:03.485 --> 24:04.878
In here, Ruth.

24:09.143 --> 24:12.059
Watch your head.

24:20.981 --> 24:24.158
Had a couple of our comrades
gussy it up for ya.

24:24.201 --> 24:27.117
See, minus 12.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.163
- It's lovely, thank you.
- Yeah.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.904
- Send my regards
down the line.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.560
- What?

24:34.603 --> 24:37.214
What, you likey
that I'm built like a whippet?

24:37.258 --> 24:40.000
- No.
Mind your cheek.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.439
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.492
- If you're out there,
Mr. Layton,

24:53.535 --> 24:55.798
now would be a great time
to come home.

25:26.350 --> 25:30.485
"Snowpiercer," come in.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.618
"Snowpiercer."

25:36.447 --> 25:38.885
Oh, shit.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.626
Hey, buddy.

25:44.891 --> 25:46.806
You bring your surfboard?

25:46.849 --> 25:48.590
- Thought we'd do
some sledding instead.

25:48.634 --> 25:51.506
Hey, what's your suit at, man?

25:51.550 --> 25:55.379
- 7:45.
The Engine.

25:55.423 --> 25:56.511
- Don't worry
about the Engine.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.599
Alex is on it.

25:57.643 --> 26:00.123
Where are you hurting, Ben?

26:00.167 --> 26:01.734
Bit of pain in the chest.

26:01.777 --> 26:04.171
- Can you move your fingers
and toes?

26:04.214 --> 26:06.652
- All right.
I'm coming down.

26:06.695 --> 26:09.785
- Too risky, Layton.
Send down a rope.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.570
- Oh, man.
Don't worry about it.

26:11.613 --> 26:12.875
You sit tight, man.
I'll be right back.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.576
They're venting?

26:17.619 --> 26:19.665
They're just rolling
fast enough to cool down.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.667
- I don't--I don't get it.
- I do.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.103
- I don't think
they got back on.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.539
- Mm?
- What are you talking about?

26:24.583 --> 26:27.281
- So who's outside?
- I don't know.

26:27.324 --> 26:28.543
You think they tell me
anything?

26:28.587 --> 26:30.719
I know Ben went out.

26:30.763 --> 26:33.069
- Yeah, well, I think I saw
two more from my window.

26:33.113 --> 26:34.984
- Well, then Alex
has to be driving.

26:35.028 --> 26:37.334
Did she ditch them?

26:37.378 --> 26:38.640
They're not answering.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.077
Martin, it's time.

26:42.905 --> 26:45.429
Yeah. Okay.

26:45.473 --> 26:46.996
What about Till?

26:47.040 --> 26:48.563
- Well, we'll just have
to go to the Engine

26:48.607 --> 26:49.912
and find out.

26:49.956 --> 26:50.913
What's happening?

26:50.957 --> 26:52.175
We have to get back

26:52.219 --> 26:53.524
with the other train.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.222
Help us, and I won't tell
Wilford

26:55.265 --> 26:57.398
you've been cooperating.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.140
Are you serious right now?

27:02.969 --> 27:04.057
- Deadly serious.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.059
Look, we need to reconnect.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.582
Okay?
What are we doing out here?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.018
- Yeah, we've been
running around aimlessly.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.630
We're running out of food.
Last chance.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.327
Hmm?

27:13.370 --> 27:17.810
Get back with Wilford
or dig a grave with Layton.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.773
Then get in the cage.

27:41.877 --> 27:42.835
What's our speed?

27:42.878 --> 27:46.099
Um, 75.

27:46.142 --> 27:48.101
- Okay, let's switch places;
I need you over here

27:48.144 --> 27:49.798
while I start
the cooling sequence.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.844
Okay, you're gonna match
these lines.

27:51.887 --> 27:55.064
Blue to blue, red to red,
and so on, you got it?

27:55.108 --> 27:57.501
- Yeah.
- Be sure, Brakeman, okay?

27:57.545 --> 27:59.286
- These currents are live.
- Yeah, match the colors.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.680
I got it.
Let's go.

28:03.638 --> 28:06.249
And I'm not
a freaking Brakeman.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.735
Hey.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.259
Hey!

28:16.303 --> 28:17.957
Okay, well, just in case
they ask,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.481
you forced me
to let you out.

29:03.437 --> 29:06.222
- Hey.
Time?

29:06.266 --> 29:08.137
- Two minutes.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.749
- All right, not to worry,
brother.

29:10.792 --> 29:14.665
There's plenty
to go around.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.842
Not too much, Layton.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.626
Let's not both run out.

29:18.669 --> 29:19.801
- Uh-huh.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.281
Hey.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.069
Hey, hey.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.636
All that surf stuff
you talking,

29:28.679 --> 29:30.899
you really do that?

29:30.943 --> 29:32.292
Bennet.

29:32.335 --> 29:34.033
Hmm?

29:34.076 --> 29:36.513
- Surfing?
- Yeah.

29:36.557 --> 29:39.603
Yeah, I spent a summer

29:39.647 --> 29:43.346
in Sopelana
when I was 16.

29:44.608 --> 29:47.916
Yeah, the locals surfed
a wave called El Bordillo.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.919
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

29:50.963 --> 29:52.355
I learned more on that wave

29:52.399 --> 29:54.836
than in seven years
of university.

29:57.186 --> 29:59.580
You ever go back?

29:59.623 --> 30:02.713
Yeah, once.

30:03.671 --> 30:07.022
By then, the rising sea levels

30:07.066 --> 30:08.415
changed the coastline.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.200
The wave was gone.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.640
- Shouldn't we start
going back?

30:16.684 --> 30:18.425
We're still too rich.

30:18.468 --> 30:21.123
- Well, how long?
- I don't--I don't know.

30:21.167 --> 30:25.084
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, Alex,
you can do this.

30:25.127 --> 30:27.521
- Okay?
- I can't.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.611
What would Melanie do?

30:31.917 --> 30:33.570
- She would just know
the answer.

30:33.614 --> 30:34.571
That's what she would do.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.747
Okay, fine, then.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.575
What would--What would Ben do?

30:38.619 --> 30:41.274
- He would grab a pen and paper
and start mansplaining.

30:41.317 --> 30:44.843
- Okay, good.
Just--just talk it out, then.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.721
- Built to work at speed,
under load,

30:53.764 --> 30:55.679
but we have neither.

30:55.723 --> 30:58.857
We're a jet engine
strapped to a toy wagon.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.641
All we have to do
is stop on a dime

31:00.684 --> 31:01.903
without stalling
or burning up

31:01.947 --> 31:04.036
twice and once in reverse.

31:06.168 --> 31:07.822
All right, Till,
there's a three-minute window

31:07.866 --> 31:09.084
to reverse back to them.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.303
Have you been avoiding me?

31:13.915 --> 31:16.744
- I told them to lock you
in the meat locker.

31:16.787 --> 31:18.528
They thought the library
was more secure.

31:18.572 --> 31:19.921
So much for that.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.575
Are they all outside?

31:21.618 --> 31:22.750
- I'm a bit busy
right now, Audrey.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.709
Well, I can see that.

31:25.753 --> 31:29.235
Ahh.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.933
Look.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.630
Look.
Look, what I have.

31:33.674 --> 31:36.068
Look!

31:36.111 --> 31:39.158
I had it on me
when they took me hostage.

31:39.201 --> 31:42.988
I have been waiting six months
for this moment.

31:52.998 --> 31:56.392
Now let's talk about
going home to Daddy.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.663
- Have you discovered
a new source?

32:06.707 --> 32:09.492
- No.
- We'll tighten our belts.

32:20.547 --> 32:22.462
I'm not listening to you.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.033
You know I make things...

32:34.604 --> 32:36.519
- Hold on tight, buddy.
I'll see you up there.

32:36.563 --> 32:39.609
- Josie, let's go.

32:41.742 --> 32:43.439
All right, Ben.

33:10.553 --> 33:12.381
Here you go.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.643
All right.
Nearly there, Ben.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.211
Nearly there.
There, it's done.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.344
Over the edge,
that's it.

33:20.433 --> 33:23.044
- Josie, throw me the switch
and start back with him.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.132
- No, not till you're
out of there.

33:24.176 --> 33:25.525
He's fading, Josie.

33:25.568 --> 33:27.135
Get going.
I'll catch up.

33:32.401 --> 33:33.620
What's your suit at?

33:33.663 --> 33:35.970
- Plenty.
Don't worry about it.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.711
I'm right behind you.

33:37.754 --> 33:40.018
Okay.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.478
Hello.

36:21.222 --> 36:22.267
Hello?

36:55.604 --> 36:58.303
Ow!
Oh, my God!

37:03.221 --> 37:04.526
Layton, come in, Layton.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.182
Layton, come in, Layton.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.782
- Your mother
didn't make it, Alex.

37:42.825 --> 37:46.307
And that idea
of an oasis out there

37:46.351 --> 37:47.613
died with her.

37:47.656 --> 37:50.093
No, it hasn't.

37:50.137 --> 37:52.835
- Well, I think you would all
be getting along much better

37:52.879 --> 37:54.576
if you discovered anything.

37:54.620 --> 37:57.362
- Well, you have no idea
what we've discovered.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.682
- Wilford has the answers,
Alex.

38:15.684 --> 38:19.122
Just keep going,
and you solve everything.

38:21.777 --> 38:25.868
Just keep going.

38:46.541 --> 38:47.890
No, don't.

38:47.934 --> 38:49.327
Get away from her.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.287
Alex, you gotta go back.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.594
- Ahead, Alex.
Back home to him.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.160
- We can't leave them
out there.

38:57.204 --> 38:59.032
- Don't listen
to her bleeding heart, Alex.

38:59.075 --> 39:01.556
Just do the calculus
of survival like Joseph would.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.385
- Stop!
Both of you, just stop!

39:04.429 --> 39:05.386
Shit.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.695
Just go ahead!

39:17.311 --> 39:19.444
Alex.

39:19.487 --> 39:21.750
Alex, stop the train.

39:21.794 --> 39:23.535
What if she was right?

39:23.578 --> 39:24.753
What if Wilford
is the best bet?

39:24.797 --> 39:27.408
- He's not.
Melanie is.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.192
Okay?

39:29.236 --> 39:31.760
We can get through this, Alex.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.849
Don't tip it the wrong way.

39:35.024 --> 39:38.027
Okay?
Yeah.

40:52.841 --> 40:54.756
- "Snowpiercer."
Come in, "Snowpiercer."

40:59.152 --> 41:00.980
Layton,
Layton, can you read me?

41:02.677 --> 41:03.983
Layton.

41:06.115 --> 41:07.900
"Snowpiercer," come in.

41:09.554 --> 41:10.816
Shit.

41:11.773 --> 41:13.122
There.

41:13.166 --> 41:15.473
There they are.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.431
There's only two--
there's only two of them.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.059
- Wait, wait.
- Sit there.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.286
Layton, come in, Layton.

41:48.854 --> 41:51.204
Layton, come in, Layton.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.730
Look, I'll be back, okay?

41:55.774 --> 41:58.037
- Josie, you've been out
too long.

41:59.299 --> 42:01.475
- I can find him.
I'll be back.

42:01.519 --> 42:05.958
- Josie, his suit ran out
five minutes ago.

42:17.099 --> 42:18.318
Layton.

42:19.624 --> 42:21.539
Layton!

42:22.931 --> 42:26.021
- What? What?
He's there?

42:26.065 --> 42:27.501
- Yes.
- He's there?

42:27.545 --> 42:28.807
He's there.

42:58.097 --> 43:02.014
So what can I get you?

43:02.057 --> 43:04.625
- I'd say I've got everything
I ever wanted.

43:04.669 --> 43:08.586
A girl, a club,

43:08.629 --> 43:11.240
and the gratitude
of the great Mr. Wilford.

43:13.025 --> 43:14.635
Come on.

43:20.162 --> 43:22.164
- Wouldn't we all love
a nice warm bath?

43:22.208 --> 43:23.775
Hmm?

43:23.818 --> 43:27.779
These two stole
hot water resources from you

43:27.822 --> 43:29.868
for the resistance.

43:29.911 --> 43:31.521
Because they had
to be clean...

43:33.915 --> 43:35.961
You go unwashed.

43:36.004 --> 43:37.658
You first.

43:37.702 --> 43:39.094
He didn't do anything.

43:49.888 --> 43:52.020
It's all right.

43:52.064 --> 43:53.674
It was worth it.

43:55.415 --> 43:56.590
Do it, please.

44:17.350 --> 44:20.222
- Well, I hate to miss
a public defiling,

44:20.266 --> 44:23.399
but the proceedings are
rather foregone, aren't they?

44:25.488 --> 44:27.577
I'd much rather be here
with my friends,

44:27.621 --> 44:29.318
embarking on a fresh path.
