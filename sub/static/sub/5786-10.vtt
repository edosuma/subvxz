WEBVTT

00:00.585 --> 00:02.462
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.671 --> 00:04.673
You're not a cop and I've been
treating you like one.

00:04.881 --> 00:06.257
You and me? It's over.

00:06.466 --> 00:08.593
I need this.
This is my one thing.

00:08.802 --> 00:10.804
Vaughn, the guy who
owns the company
thinks he walks on water,

00:11.012 --> 00:12.347
that he can charm anyone.

00:12.555 --> 00:13.890
So, I'm trying to figure out
a way to use that.

00:14.099 --> 00:15.517
So, we'll be taking that
tainted Utopium

00:15.725 --> 00:16.851
that we need to make the cure.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.436
You said he knew
where to find it.

00:18.645 --> 00:20.730
Old high school buddy of mine
was a drug dealer.

00:20.939 --> 00:22.774
Him and this other
dealer swallowed a bunch
of condoms full of Utopium.

00:22.983 --> 00:24.401
Someone must've found out.

00:24.609 --> 00:26.152
Last thing that he saw
was the Jensen water tower.

00:26.361 --> 00:29.656
So we have two bodies
packed full of tainted Utopium

00:29.864 --> 00:30.865
buried in a shallow grave.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.242
So, we start digging.

00:32.450 --> 00:33.618
<i>It's a needle in
a haystack, man.</i>

00:33.827 --> 00:35.203
Being a zombie has changed me.

00:35.412 --> 00:36.788
We belong with our own kind.

00:36.997 --> 00:38.498
- Are we breaking up?
- We have to.

00:38.707 --> 00:41.167
<i>If the cured rat
regressed to zombie form,</i>

00:41.376 --> 00:44.004
it's more than likely that
our cured humans will as well.

00:47.465 --> 00:48.633
Hey, I just got your message.

00:48.842 --> 00:49.968
I came as soon as I could.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.678
I texted you last night.
Several times.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.722
- Where were you?
- Out thinking.

00:53.930 --> 00:56.266
- Where were you, Pigpen?
- Out digging.

00:56.474 --> 00:57.475
You should probably
have a seat.

00:57.684 --> 00:58.852
Why, what happened?

01:01.312 --> 01:02.856
He wouldn't tell me, either.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.525
I thought you should both
hear this at the same time.

01:05.734 --> 01:07.861
Oh, no, are you
and Mom getting divorced?

01:10.530 --> 01:13.033
Last night, our cured rat,
New Hope,

01:13.241 --> 01:16.828
reverted to her previous
state as a zombie.

01:17.037 --> 01:20.331
Which means the cure
is only temporary.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.042
In rats, temporary.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.628
Likely, humans too,
I'm afraid.

01:25.837 --> 01:28.548
It appears a latent form
of the virus was lurking

01:28.757 --> 01:31.468
in New Hope,
and somehow re-activated.

01:33.261 --> 01:36.139
There's no reason to think
it won't do the same in you.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.141
How long do I have?

01:38.349 --> 01:42.228
It could be a day,
six months, a year.

01:42.437 --> 01:44.230
I should know more
after I run some tests.

01:49.527 --> 01:50.862
Silver lining...

01:51.071 --> 01:52.280
You know, you two
finally will be able

01:52.489 --> 01:54.240
to have hot zombie sex. Right?

01:57.952 --> 02:00.580
Room temperature zombie sex?

02:00.789 --> 02:03.124
- Yeah, about that...
- We broke up.

02:07.003 --> 02:09.798
Ah. Right.

02:10.006 --> 02:12.175
I see why you were out
all night thinking.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.468
The digging, were you...

02:13.676 --> 02:15.261
Searching for
the tainted Utopium.

02:15.470 --> 02:17.055
We need it to make more cure.

02:17.263 --> 02:18.890
Where do you think it is?

02:19.099 --> 02:22.727
In the stomach of a dead drug
dealer with a prosthetic leg.

02:22.936 --> 02:25.021
Well, the good news is, we've
managed to narrow the location

02:25.230 --> 02:27.816
of his unmarked grave to
a single 100-acre field.

02:29.901 --> 02:32.695
You really need to work on the
whole "Good news" concept.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.247
How long have I got?

02:42.455 --> 02:43.790
If it's less than
a couple weeks,

02:43.998 --> 02:45.416
I need to add brains
to my Christmas wish-list.

02:45.625 --> 02:46.793
Hard to say.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.920
We're starting a pool.
You interested?

02:49.129 --> 02:52.590
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

03:21.286 --> 03:24.706
This isn't the sort of
visit from old Saint Nick
I had in mind.

03:25.915 --> 03:26.916
Beard color,

03:27.959 --> 03:29.085
white as snow.

03:30.962 --> 03:32.672
Happy holidays.
What've you got?

03:32.881 --> 03:34.632
Here.

03:34.841 --> 03:37.844
This pipe appears to have
struck our victim in the teeth

03:38.052 --> 03:41.014
and caused the mortal
bruises that encircle
his head like a wreath.

03:41.222 --> 03:44.601
David Biel, a resident of the
Yesler Mission Men's Shelter.

03:44.809 --> 03:46.311
Lately, he's been
raising them money

03:46.519 --> 03:48.354
at Third and Cherry dressed
like this, ringing a bell.

03:48.563 --> 03:49.898
Any idea why someone rang his?

03:50.106 --> 03:51.608
No. Could be
a robbery gone bad.

03:51.816 --> 03:54.485
Dead Santa,
the night before Christmas?

03:54.694 --> 03:56.321
No shortage of
potential vision triggers.

03:56.529 --> 03:57.655
Maybe I'll get something.

03:57.864 --> 03:59.282
Yeah, shoot me an email.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.329
Sorry.

04:04.537 --> 04:07.165
I know how much you
want Clive to restore
your investigative privileges.

04:07.373 --> 04:08.625
Meantime...

04:08.833 --> 04:11.211
Yes, Olivia,
there is a Santa Claus brain.

04:19.802 --> 04:22.972
My high school coach
thought digging holes and
filling them built character.

04:23.181 --> 04:24.474
He'd be so proud.

04:27.018 --> 04:27.977
Wait.

04:31.773 --> 04:33.900
Add it to the,
"Not Utopium" pile.

04:38.488 --> 04:41.199
At this rate,
we'll have dug up the
entire field by Easter.

04:41.407 --> 04:43.409
More digging? God...

04:44.494 --> 04:46.537
Rest, ye merry gentlemen.

04:46.746 --> 04:49.374
I brought the traditional
Peking Duck.

04:49.582 --> 04:52.210
I love how giving you are
on this Santa brain.

04:52.418 --> 04:53.586
I got you
a little something, Liv.

04:53.795 --> 04:54.796
Aw.

04:58.216 --> 04:59.592
<i>Zombie High,
The Complete Second Season!</i>

04:59.801 --> 05:01.386
What's my gift?

05:01.594 --> 05:03.846
Not having to watch that.

05:11.479 --> 05:15.733
I bring good tidings of
great joy and Benjamins!

05:15.942 --> 05:17.902
Merry Christmas!

05:18.111 --> 05:22.240
Get those deliveries
out to all the good
little boys and girls, huh?

05:22.448 --> 05:25.743
You! You! Merry Christmas.

05:25.952 --> 05:29.038
Not to be a humbugger,

05:29.247 --> 05:31.958
some of our customers are
getting restless.
They miss Natalie.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.793
I'm working on it, okay?

05:34.002 --> 05:37.171
A new zombie hooker
isn't just going to
show up under the tree.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.549
Can you see?

05:39.757 --> 05:41.968
Baracus handed down his
latest round of indictments

05:42.176 --> 05:43.386
against Mr. Boss'
organization.

05:43.594 --> 05:46.097
This is good, right?

05:46.306 --> 05:47.682
The D.A.'s taking out
our competition.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.434
That's a very
merry Christmas, indeed.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.853
Yay!

05:52.020 --> 05:54.731
Well, would you look
who's back from sabbatical.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.566
What did you bring me,
Chief? A turkey?

05:57.900 --> 05:59.110
Even better.

05:59.319 --> 06:00.903
The guy who shot you
in the face.

06:01.446 --> 06:02.530
You see?

06:02.739 --> 06:04.115
This...

06:04.324 --> 06:06.534
This is what the holidays
are all about.

06:18.796 --> 06:23.509
Man,
last night almost killed me.

06:23.718 --> 06:25.303
You sure know
how to ring it in.

06:25.511 --> 06:27.305
Yup. Day one of the new year.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.640
We put in a solid eight hours.
Let's call it.

06:29.849 --> 06:31.142
Oh, I can't.

06:31.351 --> 06:34.228
I'm doing another canvass
of Pioneer Square.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.981
Swing by when you're done
and you can canvass this.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.901
And by canvass,
I mean have sex with.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.486
Ooh.

06:50.078 --> 06:52.580
I've got some information
about the Santa Claus murder.

06:52.789 --> 06:54.791
- This girl said
I should come in.
- What girl?

06:54.999 --> 06:56.834
I don't know.
Some pale blondie.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.419
Huh.

06:58.628 --> 06:59.587
Let's hear it.

07:05.927 --> 07:08.763
And another beer can.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.682
Well, here's where the ancient
drunken tribe of...

07:11.891 --> 07:12.975
Shh...

07:13.559 --> 07:16.187
Look.

07:16.396 --> 07:18.481
Is that what she looks like
when she's having a vision?

07:22.985 --> 07:24.529
I've gotta go talk to Clive.

07:27.657 --> 07:30.910
A witness saw you
outside the shelter
flashing a roll of cash.

07:31.119 --> 07:32.286
Where'd you get the money?

07:32.495 --> 07:34.497
I had my broker sell
some tech stocks.

07:45.716 --> 07:46.801
This might help.

08:06.446 --> 08:08.698
So, I just got word
that a witness places
you at a bar

08:08.906 --> 08:11.117
across the street
minutes before the murder.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.750
You know, it's hard enough
being a rich zombie.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.836
You've got to worry
about paying taxes,

08:22.044 --> 08:23.254
eating brains.

08:23.463 --> 08:25.131
And now some
nut-job's out there

08:25.339 --> 08:28.259
picking off your kind like
ducks in a shooting gallery.

08:32.889 --> 08:34.974
What happened, Chief?

08:35.183 --> 08:36.934
You tussle with a Doberman?

08:41.564 --> 08:44.400
One of our client's bodyguards
went after Chief by mistake.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.904
Oh, he thinks he may
have scratched him.

08:48.112 --> 08:52.241
Well, I guess we'll
hear soon if all zombie
hell breaks loose.

09:05.922 --> 09:06.797
It's okay. It's okay.

09:07.006 --> 09:08.799
It's okay.
You're safe.

09:09.008 --> 09:10.134
- She's not okay.
- What?

09:10.343 --> 09:11.761
She's been scratched.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.138
You know the rules, Hayley.

09:15.473 --> 09:17.016
A zombie didn't scratch me!

09:17.225 --> 09:18.309
It was just a pricker bush.

09:18.518 --> 09:20.019
Put the gun away.

09:20.228 --> 09:22.563
She's been scratched, man.
She's gonna be one of them.

09:22.772 --> 09:26.150
She said it was
a pricker bush.
I believe her.

09:28.694 --> 09:31.113
Looks like you're
gonna have to make
a decision here, Burdick.

09:33.658 --> 09:35.034
Looks like you will, too.

09:49.507 --> 09:50.633
Cut!

09:50.841 --> 09:52.426
Come on, people!

09:52.635 --> 09:55.304
There's only one gunshot.
So why are there two squibs?

09:55.513 --> 09:57.306
Standards won't let us get
away with that much blood.

09:57.515 --> 09:58.516
Then let's go again.

10:08.901 --> 10:10.611
Last night, I was watching
<i>Zombie High,</i>

10:10.820 --> 10:12.446
and now I'm friggin' in it.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.240
But only because
the star's been murdered.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.867
Is there a word that means
both cool and awful?

10:17.076 --> 10:19.453
In the 16th century,
the word was egregious.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.122
Now it just means,
"shockingly bad."

10:21.330 --> 10:22.957
As in, the way <i>Zombie High</i>
treats science.

10:23.165 --> 10:26.085
It's not supposed to be a
documentary on zombie biology.

10:26.294 --> 10:27.628
Then mission accomplished.

10:27.837 --> 10:29.964
It's about
love and friendship,

10:30.172 --> 10:33.259
and what happens
when a group of kids
face the biggest exam of all,

10:33.467 --> 10:34.385
survival.

10:34.594 --> 10:36.596
Oh, my God.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.514
That's where Burdick
defied Principal Henson

10:38.723 --> 10:40.182
and went out looking
for more ammo.

10:41.684 --> 10:42.810
And this is
the drinking fountain

10:43.019 --> 10:44.312
where Burdick
first got the news

10:44.520 --> 10:46.856
that his foster brother
was his actual brother.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.737
And that's where Burdick died.

10:59.035 --> 11:00.786
Victim's death was
nearly instantaneous,

11:00.995 --> 11:02.913
from a single bullet
that severed the aorta.

11:03.122 --> 11:05.166
We'll retrieve the slug
when we get the body
back in the morgue.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.084
It was supposed to be a blank.

11:07.293 --> 11:10.796
Somehow, the prop
gun got switched
with this loaded.45.

11:11.005 --> 11:13.549
Victim's name was
Jordan Mason Marsh.

11:13.758 --> 11:16.010
- Decent actor?
- He had his fans.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.762
We're still looking
for the prop gun.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.430
The actor who
pulled the trigger

11:19.639 --> 11:21.182
apparently had no idea
he was holding a real weapon.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.142
- Who was that?
- Wyatt Carver.

11:23.351 --> 11:25.394
Cody.

11:25.603 --> 11:28.606
- Sorry.
- Uh, she's seen every episode.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.232
- On purpose.
- All right.

11:30.441 --> 11:32.360
I'll drop by the morgue
once I've wrapped up here.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.362
Right. Well, then...

11:37.198 --> 11:39.533
You should get them to show
you footage of the shooting.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.785
That was the plan.

11:41.410 --> 11:42.495
Okay.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.541
Talk to the props master.
He should...

11:47.750 --> 11:49.543
This is not
my first rodeo, Liv.

11:58.511 --> 11:59.595
Liv.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.433
You really know
this show, huh?

12:05.893 --> 12:07.937
That can come in handy.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.522
You mind helping me out
with this one?

12:11.315 --> 12:12.650
Go. Of course.

12:15.486 --> 12:17.947
What do you say we
go catch some bad guys?

12:18.155 --> 12:19.407
Uh, don't get
carried away now.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.367
We'll take it day by day.
See how it goes.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.836
It's so incredibly tragic.

12:32.044 --> 12:34.004
Can you think of
anyone who might have
wanted to kill Jordan?

12:34.213 --> 12:36.924
He was an intense young man.
That could cause friction.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.634
Can we get access to dailies?

12:38.843 --> 12:40.594
There might be something
in them that speaks to motive.

12:40.761 --> 12:44.223
Here's the online password.
We archive every take.

12:44.432 --> 12:46.308
Anything else you need,
just ask...

12:46.517 --> 12:47.560
My assistant.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.235
Thirteen...

12:58.571 --> 12:59.947
Fourteen.
You got it, one more.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.908
Yeah, one more.

13:05.619 --> 13:06.829
Push.

13:08.247 --> 13:09.165
Fifteen.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.167
Way to work, VDC.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.043
Look at them guns, son.

13:13.252 --> 13:14.336
Hmm?

13:14.545 --> 13:16.464
I can't
lift my fist that high.

13:16.672 --> 13:19.258
Then
we're doing something right.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.761
But it's time
to kick things up a notch.

13:24.472 --> 13:26.140
No!

13:26.348 --> 13:28.434
My own fitness band?

13:29.310 --> 13:30.561
Oh, boy.

13:30.770 --> 13:32.813
I guess this means
we're going steady, huh?

13:33.022 --> 13:35.232
He said, "Yes."

13:35.441 --> 13:37.777
Hey, you know, I really
appreciate your dedication.

13:37.985 --> 13:41.071
To my training, and to your
extracurricular duties.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.365
I mean, you're really
plowing through your list.

13:43.574 --> 13:44.950
<i>Mr. Du Clark,</i>

13:45.159 --> 13:46.660
<i>Dr. Lockett is anxious
to show you something.</i>

13:46.869 --> 13:48.788
Tell him I'll be
down there when I can.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.122
Uh, down where?

13:50.331 --> 13:51.791
I thought this was
the lowest level.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.376
We got a lab in Tacoma.

13:54.585 --> 13:56.587
- Tacoma's, what,
40 miles away?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:56.796 --> 13:59.340
Seems like a good
goal for the week.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.300
To the treadmill!

14:01.509 --> 14:02.968
Come on.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.473
Did you find the prop gun?

14:08.349 --> 14:10.184
Not yet.

14:10.392 --> 14:13.479
You can bet it'll be
me who gets fired for it,
not Numbnuts.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.315
I love the cute little
nicknames the crew
have for the actors.

14:16.524 --> 14:18.275
I don't know how
many times I told him.

14:18.484 --> 14:20.486
Never take eyes off
your firearm.

14:20.694 --> 14:24.782
What I don't get is
how do you pick up a real
gun and not realize it?

14:24.990 --> 14:27.201
That's a Smith & Wesson
peeking out of
your shoulder holster?

14:27.409 --> 14:28.661
Yeah, a model 59-06.

14:28.869 --> 14:29.954
Well, this...

14:33.040 --> 14:33.999
Is a prop.

14:35.376 --> 14:37.211
Can you tell the difference?

14:37.419 --> 14:40.381
Whoa.
This could be my gun.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.383
Except this
only shoots blanks.

14:44.051 --> 14:47.012
So where do we find Numbnuts?

14:47.221 --> 14:49.348
Jordan was
a method actor's actor.

14:49.557 --> 14:50.724
He was very professional.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.519
Thoughtful, technical.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.689
He raised everybody's game.

14:57.815 --> 14:58.983
Jordan's initials?

15:01.485 --> 15:04.321
I remember the scene
you and he did in here

15:04.530 --> 15:06.073
after your prom date
cheated on you

15:06.282 --> 15:07.992
and Jordan helped
you through it.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.327
And then he threw
acid in the zombie
chem teacher's face.

15:16.375 --> 15:19.128
Dude saved my life.
I couldn't save his.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.048
I couldn't save his.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.890
You had a few scenes
today with the prop gun.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.766
Any idea where you
might have put it down?

15:32.975 --> 15:34.059
I didn't put it down.

15:34.268 --> 15:35.936
You're sure?

15:36.145 --> 15:38.606
Never take eyes
off your firearm.

15:38.814 --> 15:40.065
That's the number one rule.

15:42.484 --> 15:45.821
So, you're saying you
shot Jordan with the
gun you were handed?

15:46.030 --> 15:47.907
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.658
Look, I gotta bounce.

15:50.910 --> 15:52.202
But help yourselves.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.165
Anything? Really?

15:56.373 --> 15:58.125
Wyatt seemed pretty
adamant about not putting
down his prop gun.

15:58.334 --> 16:01.003
It's like every candy
bar on Earth.

16:01.211 --> 16:04.798
What if Prop Master Fitz
intentionally handed him
a real gun,

16:05.007 --> 16:06.967
with a bullet in the chamber?

16:07.176 --> 16:08.552
Interesting theory.

16:10.179 --> 16:11.555
Oh, man.

16:11.764 --> 16:13.265
This muffin is still warm.

16:13.474 --> 16:16.477
Or maybe Wyatt switched
the prop gun for the real gun

16:16.685 --> 16:18.312
because he wanted
to kill Jordan.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.189
Maybe.

16:20.397 --> 16:23.233
Did you know the
donuts at the precinct
are all day-old?

16:23.442 --> 16:24.818
That's how civil servants
are valued.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.820
Although, if Wyatt set
the whole thing up,

16:27.029 --> 16:28.989
why not say you
put down the prop?

16:29.198 --> 16:31.617
If anyone could've done it,
you've got a better alibi.

16:34.536 --> 16:35.746
Is that lasagna?

16:38.207 --> 16:40.376
It's hard for me to
imagine Wyatt doing it.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.878
Did you see his face?
He was devastated.

16:43.087 --> 16:44.672
Yeah, he seems
real devastated.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.174
I think I'm seeing motive.

16:48.384 --> 16:50.552
"Who will survive?"

16:50.761 --> 16:53.681
Yeah, they kill off a major
character each season.
It's kind of their thing.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.516
Season One,
Wyatt's up front.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.559
Season Two,
Jordan has joined him.

16:57.768 --> 17:00.521
Season Three,
Jordan is the main man.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.649
Where do you think Wyatt will
be standing Season Four now?

17:03.857 --> 17:04.984
Yeah.

17:12.783 --> 17:14.034
Well, there it is.

17:14.243 --> 17:16.078
Some of the most famous
junk in America.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.454
Cover it.

17:17.663 --> 17:20.332
Cover it. Who gets
pierced there? Why?

17:20.541 --> 17:21.959
It's called a Prince Albert.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.627
I wonder how you get it
through airport security?

17:23.836 --> 17:25.129
You two don't seem
that skeeved.

17:25.337 --> 17:26.880
We've pulled stranger
things out of corpses.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.299
Golf balls. A snake.

17:29.508 --> 17:30.884
Besides, we were expecting it.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.386
Jordan's pierced...

17:32.594 --> 17:34.221
Yeah, it's front and center
on his sex tape.

17:34.388 --> 17:35.305
He had a sex tape?

17:35.514 --> 17:38.100
Aw... So innocent.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.603
It co-starred <i>Zombie High's</i>
own Starlee Decker.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.898
She plays Hayley, desired
by both Burdick and Cody.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.234
She and Jordan
were an IRL item.

17:47.443 --> 17:49.361
Yeah, the tape went public
about a year ago

17:49.570 --> 17:51.739
after some burglar
broke into Starlee's house
and stole her laptop.

17:51.947 --> 17:56.118
Some advice, Clive?
Always keep your
sex tapes on the cloud.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.828
Theirs blew up.

17:58.037 --> 18:00.622
It was huge. It actually
helped the show's ratings.

18:00.831 --> 18:02.207
Jordan became
the breakout star.

18:02.416 --> 18:03.625
Mmm. The lighting
and composition

18:03.834 --> 18:05.085
were above par
for a celebrity sex tape.

18:05.294 --> 18:07.379
But enough about
Jordan's famous genitals.

18:07.588 --> 18:08.881
Check it out.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.632
A tattoo.

18:10.841 --> 18:13.052
"Never forget."
In the process
of being removed.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.219
Hmm.

18:14.428 --> 18:15.471
Painful and ironic.

18:15.679 --> 18:17.181
But never forget what?

18:26.607 --> 18:28.442
Ugh, it's like a
bad-acting workshop.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.069
This is what you get
when a TV show

18:30.277 --> 18:32.071
worships at the
altar of youth,

18:32.279 --> 18:34.740
bimbos and himbos
running around screaming,

18:34.948 --> 18:37.367
in a school where,
apparently, shop class
isn't the only place

18:37.576 --> 18:39.536
to see something wooden
and poorly constructed.

18:39.745 --> 18:42.915
That one needs to remember her
character's emotional truth.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.043
That's the essence of acting.
It's a search for truth.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.591
Tell me more about this truth
and how to find it.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.553
To create a reality where the
truth is fear of zombies,

18:56.762 --> 19:00.099
I would draw on a sense memory
of something that scared me.

19:00.307 --> 19:03.977
Like the time I went camping
and I saw a bear.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.522
Or the times you've
seen actual zombies.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.691
My point is
you don't act with words.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.986
You act with your soul.
With your imagination.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.571
That's what gives
the words life.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.991
Remember what it's like
to eat an apple?

19:18.200 --> 19:21.620
Oh, look there's one now,
ripening on this tree.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.957
Hey, I was saving that.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.168
The skin is so
smooth and cool.

19:28.377 --> 19:31.296
Here, let me make it
shiny before I...

19:32.381 --> 19:33.340
Mmm.

19:33.549 --> 19:36.009
So crisp and juicy.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.178
Oh, sorry. I got some on you.

19:38.387 --> 19:39.805
Fascinating.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.640
I wish I had some popcorn.

19:41.849 --> 19:44.309
Oh, wait, I do.

19:54.653 --> 19:56.113
I think we've got
a major problem.

19:57.948 --> 20:00.492
A "Major" major problem
or a minor major problem?

20:00.701 --> 20:02.786
I saw your little bro-down
in the gym.

20:02.995 --> 20:04.288
- Oh...
- He's playing you.

20:04.496 --> 20:05.831
Please.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.583
You can't play a player.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.668
You're too vain to see it.

20:09.877 --> 20:11.712
He's blinded you
with man-jewelry

20:11.920 --> 20:13.630
and the promise
of a rock-hard ass.

20:13.839 --> 20:14.840
Well,

20:16.091 --> 20:17.217
promise delivered.

20:21.597 --> 20:23.307
Do you know what Mom
used to say about you?

20:23.515 --> 20:24.892
"You should've gotten
that man's name?"

20:25.100 --> 20:26.977
Vaughn Du Clark,

20:27.186 --> 20:30.314
smartest man in the world
until you stroke his ego.

20:31.732 --> 20:33.525
Then he's like all the rest.

20:39.740 --> 20:41.200
Sorry, player.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.415
The almond milk seems off.

20:48.624 --> 20:50.876
Just get me a
kale-ginger juice.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.711
We were hoping
to find Starlee.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.547
Poor thing was in no condition
to play a devastated teenager.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.174
I pushed her call till 3:00.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.010
I'd be happy to get you
time with her tomorrow.

21:00.219 --> 21:02.179
About those billboards.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.556
Had you decided who
was going to be written off
the show this year?

21:04.765 --> 21:06.558
We hadn't.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.268
With Jordan's death,
I guess the decision's
been made for us.

21:08.477 --> 21:10.187
Where's my kale-ginger?

21:10.395 --> 21:13.232
The class that Jordan
adopted wants 10 seats
at the memorial service.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.943
Never a dull moment.
Please, eat.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.784
I recommend the salmon.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.202
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.995
Nice work in that
chase scene yesterday.

21:27.204 --> 21:29.748
Oh, <i>grazie.</i> You must be new.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.833
Has anyone showed you
how zombies walk?

21:32.042 --> 21:34.378
Oh, we're just here
investigating Jordan's murder.

21:34.586 --> 21:37.089
Oh, sorry.

21:37.297 --> 21:41.260
Um, Wyatt told us
he never lost track
of his prop gun.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.053
As far as you know,
is that true?

21:43.262 --> 21:45.013
Hilarious.

21:45.222 --> 21:46.974
That dude loses his gun
all the time.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.017
It turns up in transpo vans,

21:49.226 --> 21:51.311
uh, restrooms,
the silverware tub.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.147
We should cut him some slack.
At least Wyatt talks to us.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.650
Unlike our dear departed
Marlon Bran-douche.

21:56.858 --> 21:58.777
Jordan wouldn't
even acknowledge us.

21:58.986 --> 22:02.489
That's because he
wasn't playing Burdick.
He was being Burdick.

22:02.698 --> 22:04.491
Burdick hated zombies, ergo...

22:04.658 --> 22:07.160
Hey, hey, without us,
there is no <i>Zombie High.</i>

22:07.369 --> 22:08.912
It's just<i>... High.</i>

22:09.121 --> 22:11.456
Yeah, where's
the mutual respect?

22:11.665 --> 22:13.375
You know what'd be fun?

22:13.583 --> 22:15.711
A zombie show
where a zombie's the star.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.004
That's dumb.

22:17.212 --> 22:19.047
Jordan might've
been a good actor,

22:19.256 --> 22:21.174
but try to find anyone
on the crew that'll say
anything good about him.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.635
He didn't care that
he was gonna put
us all out of work.

22:23.844 --> 22:26.013
How's that?

22:26.221 --> 22:27.931
He's such a big star now
that he was trying to get the
show moved down to L.A.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.517
so he could pursue
his movie career.

22:30.726 --> 22:31.810
Avoid the flan.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.858
What's with you?
Why were you all twitchy?

22:38.025 --> 22:40.319
Zombies
kinda freak me out.

22:42.446 --> 22:44.698
Oh, my God. It's Kell Guthrie.

22:44.906 --> 22:47.200
He's deaf. He plays Daniel,
the gifted student.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.870
He has the power
to smell zombies.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.747
I'm more interested
in his tattoo.

22:55.334 --> 22:59.004
The tattoo is a tribute
to an assistant director
named Jenny Hulce.

22:59.212 --> 23:01.340
She died last season.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.925
She fell asleep at the wheel,
driving home from set
at 5:00 in the morning.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.345
We saw Jordan was getting
his tattoo removed.

23:17.022 --> 23:19.649
He says, "That figures."

23:19.858 --> 23:22.903
Well, we heard
Jordan could be intense.

23:23.070 --> 23:25.655
"He'd only answer to his
character name, Burdick.

23:25.864 --> 23:29.701
"He refused to shower
when the zombies cut off the
water supply at the school.

23:29.910 --> 23:32.412
"He demanded
30 takes for every scene.

23:32.621 --> 23:35.415
"It wasn't intense,
it was insane."

23:35.624 --> 23:38.585
Jordan had us working
so late on Fridays,
we called them Fraturdays.

23:43.131 --> 23:45.133
Kell says, "Jenny Hulce
would be alive,

23:45.342 --> 23:48.095
"if Jordan didn't cause
production to shoot so late."

23:50.430 --> 23:51.807
Hey, bro.
Sorry to cut in.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.058
You want to check out set?

23:53.266 --> 23:54.142
They're ready for
my next scene.

23:55.769 --> 23:58.688
Go. I'll finish up here.

23:58.897 --> 24:03.193
So, basically, this next
scene here, 34, is about
Cody overcoming his fears.

24:03.402 --> 24:05.278
- So, he...
- Wyatt.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.613
Scene 34 revisions.

24:06.822 --> 24:08.824
Sweet. Can I get a copy
for my friend here?

24:10.450 --> 24:11.952
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.662
I'm lucky.

24:13.870 --> 24:16.289
I was born with one of those
kinds of minds that, uh...

24:16.456 --> 24:17.958
How do you call 'em again?

24:18.125 --> 24:19.668
- Photographic?
- Yes.

24:19.876 --> 24:22.129
I'm messing with you.

24:22.337 --> 24:25.173
Seriously, though, I only
need to hear the words a few
times before I lock 'em in.

24:25.382 --> 24:27.843
Hey, you know what?
You wanna run lines with me?

24:28.051 --> 24:29.302
You be Hayley.

24:29.511 --> 24:30.720
- Me?
- Yeah.

24:30.929 --> 24:31.930
Sure!

24:33.932 --> 24:35.434
So, even with all the changes,

24:35.642 --> 24:38.311
this scene's still about
Cody finding the courage...

24:38.520 --> 24:39.855
Let's do it.

24:40.063 --> 24:42.441
"Cody crosses to Hayley,
who is crying."

24:48.572 --> 24:49.823
Burdick's gone, Cody.

24:50.657 --> 24:51.700
Wow.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.618
Okay.

24:56.371 --> 24:57.831
I know that, Hayley.

24:58.039 --> 24:59.583
But there's a whole lot of us
who still need you.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.334
What am I supposed
to do about it, Hayley?

25:01.501 --> 25:03.378
Do I act like
zombies don't exist?

25:03.587 --> 25:05.839
Like, all, no biggie.
Burdick transferred
to South Union High.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.883
Who wants to help me
with homecoming float?

25:08.091 --> 25:09.968
Don't act like
everything's cool!

25:10.177 --> 25:13.054
Don't act like we're
not in the middle of
a zombie apocalypse!

25:13.263 --> 25:17.017
Don't act like
life as we know it
will ever be the same.

25:17.225 --> 25:19.436
Just act like you know
what to do with this.

25:31.198 --> 25:32.449
Let's do this thing.

25:39.873 --> 25:41.625
- Wyatt?
- Right.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.210
Looks like
they're ready for me.

25:45.212 --> 25:48.465
You know, I...
I didn't see a slap in here.

25:49.966 --> 25:52.928
- Interesting choice.
- It just felt honest.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.721
I'll see you around.

25:56.848 --> 25:58.725
Huh, looks like
we know who's gonna
be front-and-center

25:58.934 --> 26:00.143
on the Season Four poster.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.145
Thanks, but I'm happy
in my current job.

26:05.899 --> 26:08.193
It was all about finding
my motivation.

26:14.157 --> 26:15.659
Have they posted
the new dailies?

26:15.867 --> 26:18.578
I wanna see how Starlee
played my scene with Wyatt.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.580
- Your scene?
- Well, Hayley's.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.916
- She helps Cody to overcome...
- No, no, no, no!

26:23.124 --> 26:25.919
No spoilers! I'm only halfway
through Season Two.

26:26.127 --> 26:27.629
I thought you hated the show.

26:27.837 --> 26:30.674
I did. But it's like mental
pork rinds. I can't stop!

26:30.882 --> 26:33.009
Although, I still don't see
why they shoot in Seattle

26:33.218 --> 26:34.761
if the show's supposed
to take place in Portland.

26:34.928 --> 26:36.054
Tax breaks.

26:36.263 --> 26:37.639
Oh.

26:37.847 --> 26:39.099
Did you get to the part where
Hayley and Burdick

26:39.307 --> 26:41.017
put up a disco ball
in the janitor's closet?

26:41.226 --> 26:43.019
I'd ship those two
if he weren't dead.

26:43.228 --> 26:47.232
To that point, I also found
this, from Episode 210.

26:50.235 --> 26:52.487
<i>I got you something else
for your birthday, Daniel.</i>

26:53.780 --> 26:55.240
<i>You can read lips, right?</i>

26:57.826 --> 26:59.202
<i>That's it!</i>

26:59.411 --> 27:00.745
<i>Damn it, Jordan!</i>

27:00.954 --> 27:03.039
<i>Which one of you bastards
upper-decked me?</i>

27:03.248 --> 27:05.584
<i>- Keep rolling. Let's go
again, right away!
- Okay...</i>

27:05.792 --> 27:09.796
<i>I am sick and tired
of all these pranks!</i>

27:09.963 --> 27:12.215
<i>They're not funny.</i>

27:12.424 --> 27:15.594
<i>The security cameras
go in tomorrow. I'm gonna
catch whoever's doing this!</i>

27:23.310 --> 27:25.353
Jordan wasn't a very popular
man on set, was he?

27:25.562 --> 27:27.731
I wonder if he ever put
in those security cameras.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.071
Dr. Lockett.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.323
- Looks like we're both
putting in some OT.
- Shh.

27:38.116 --> 27:40.744
I'm going to expose Max Rager.

27:40.952 --> 27:43.121
I'm taking all our
research to the press.

27:43.330 --> 27:44.748
Why tell me this?

27:46.541 --> 27:48.835
Because if I fail...

27:49.044 --> 27:52.297
If I suddenly just disappear,
like my predecessors,

27:52.505 --> 27:55.675
you need to be the
one to tell the world
what goes on here.

27:55.884 --> 27:59.054
About your work.
About my work.

27:59.262 --> 28:01.723
About the existence
of zombies.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.863
Maybe Jordan's
surveillance cameras caught
the mystery defecator.

28:17.072 --> 28:19.616
Yeah, this is why
I became a detective.

28:30.335 --> 28:33.380
Why is Starlee
in Jordan's trailer?

28:33.588 --> 28:35.298
And what's she
doing on his computer?

28:38.134 --> 28:41.680
I'm Detective Babineaux.
This is Assistant ME Moore.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.348
Yeah, um...

28:43.556 --> 28:46.059
Jordan never took back
his key and I was just...

28:46.267 --> 28:48.103
Worried he forgot to
do something else.

28:48.311 --> 28:50.355
Update his system software?

28:50.563 --> 28:54.192
I think he may have
made another sex tape of us
and never destroyed it.

28:54.401 --> 28:55.860
You think he'd do that
without letting you know?

28:56.069 --> 28:59.447
Yeah, he could be a real...

28:59.656 --> 29:00.657
I guess the word is...

29:02.701 --> 29:03.743
You dick!

29:03.952 --> 29:06.621
You want everyone to know
that you released that video,
not some burglar?

29:06.830 --> 29:08.206
Because I will tell the world!

29:08.415 --> 29:09.708
I don't think you will.

29:18.466 --> 29:21.845
Copy that.
They need you in wardrobe.

29:22.053 --> 29:24.139
Oh, you're free to go.
We know where to find you.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.272
What'd you see?

29:32.480 --> 29:34.149
It sounded like Jordan
released the first sex tape,

29:34.357 --> 29:35.734
not some burglar.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.068
Starlee was pissed.

29:37.277 --> 29:39.529
- Pissed enough to kill him?
- Maybe.

29:39.738 --> 29:42.657
There was something else
on that sex tape that he was
sure would keep her quiet.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.534
The crime lab can
check the hard drive.

29:44.743 --> 29:46.870
I doubt they'll find any
security cam footage, though.

29:51.082 --> 29:52.250
No wires.

29:52.459 --> 29:54.753
Fakes. Just for show.

29:58.506 --> 29:59.966
Hey.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.760
Sorry, I never
caught your name.

30:01.968 --> 30:03.428
My boss never uses it.

30:04.095 --> 30:05.263
Lana.

30:05.472 --> 30:06.765
Yeah. What's up, Lana?

30:06.973 --> 30:08.558
Bonnie lied.

30:08.767 --> 30:10.894
The writers did decide
who to write off the show.

30:11.102 --> 30:14.147
She just didn't want to
deal with damage control,
if the cast found out.

30:14.355 --> 30:16.232
- Was it Kell?
- No.

30:16.441 --> 30:18.318
Starlee? Tara?

30:18.485 --> 30:20.570
- Who's Tara?
- She plays Chloe,
the artsy one.

30:20.779 --> 30:21.654
Oh.

30:21.821 --> 30:23.406
- Was it...
- It was Wyatt.

30:23.615 --> 30:24.783
No!

30:24.991 --> 30:29.370
And he knew
because I told him.

30:29.579 --> 30:31.748
After we started
sleeping together.

30:31.956 --> 30:33.875
He's so nice and...

30:34.083 --> 30:37.128
He'd ask about my job
and what was going on
in the writers' room.

30:37.337 --> 30:40.006
Then a few months ago, he
read for the Blue Ranger part

30:40.173 --> 30:41.674
in the new
<i>Power Rangers</i> movie.

30:41.841 --> 30:44.302
I don't know if he has
the range for Blue.

30:44.511 --> 30:48.973
Wyatt started agonizing about
how this movie might interfere
with his job here next season.

30:49.182 --> 30:51.142
And it killed me to
see him so worried.

30:51.351 --> 30:54.896
So, I told him the truth.

30:55.104 --> 30:57.649
That he was gonna bite the
big one on <i>Zombie High.</i>

30:57.857 --> 30:59.192
Yeah.

30:59.400 --> 31:02.070
Then he didn't get the movie
and he dumped me.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.240
I just thought
you should know.

31:08.117 --> 31:09.661
If I'm hearing you right,

31:09.869 --> 31:12.580
there's going to be another
<i>Power Rangers</i> movie?

31:14.499 --> 31:17.752
The real headline
is that I still don't
believe Wyatt's guilty.

31:17.961 --> 31:20.672
I mean, he comes across
as so genuinely innocent.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.133
If he were guilty, it would be
the performance of a lifetime.

31:24.342 --> 31:28.179
Wait till you see what
the computer lab boys
found on Jordan's hard drive.

31:37.981 --> 31:39.232
<i>Oh, when's your call time?</i>

31:40.066 --> 31:41.651
<i>00.</i>

31:41.860 --> 31:43.027
<i>I'm first up with Kell.</i>

31:43.236 --> 31:44.863
Aw, we missed the good stuff.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.865
No, you didn't.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.075
<i>Lucky you.</i>

31:49.284 --> 31:53.079
<i>I can barely
keep a straight face
working with him.</i>

31:53.288 --> 31:54.747
<i>"I smell zombies."</i>

31:54.956 --> 31:57.792
<i>"Are you there, zombies?
I can't hear you."</i>

31:58.001 --> 31:59.460
What a horrible person!

31:59.669 --> 32:02.255
And if that went public,
it would destroy her career.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.465
That's what I thought.

32:04.674 --> 32:06.634
So, as long as Jordan
had this video, he had
total power over Starlee.

32:06.843 --> 32:07.886
Absolutely.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.013
Ravi took a video
of me snoring,

32:10.221 --> 32:12.015
and I was on the
verge of ripping out

32:12.223 --> 32:14.559
every follicle of his facial
hair if he hadn't deleted it.

32:14.767 --> 32:17.353
- Steady.
- Let's go pay Starlee a visit.

32:23.151 --> 32:24.777
Nice robot.

32:24.986 --> 32:28.323
It's a gift from a
Chinese business associate.

32:28.531 --> 32:32.744
Sorry, there's nothing
in here about it being able
to hunt and kill zombies.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.246
Yeah, right now,
I think we've got an even
bigger zombie problem.

32:35.455 --> 32:37.457
Yeah? What would that be?

32:37.665 --> 32:40.209
Dr. Lockett gave me this.

32:40.418 --> 32:42.754
He said it contains
all of Max Rager's secrets.

32:42.962 --> 32:45.340
He's going to give
one to the press, too,
if you don't stop him.

32:52.180 --> 32:54.182
Dr. Lockett
really shouldn't have
told you all this.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.019
Ah, well...

32:59.020 --> 33:00.355
The damage has been done.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.440
Might as well see
what he was talking about.

33:03.650 --> 33:05.735
Welcome to Tacoma.

33:08.947 --> 33:12.367
Ah. It's okay, Doc.
I just wanted to show
him a feeding.

33:12.575 --> 33:14.702
- Mind doing the honors?
- Of course.

33:16.621 --> 33:18.665
We get our brains from a
medical testing facility.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.500
Not exactly the
freshest supply,

33:20.708 --> 33:24.003
but then again,
our patrons aren't what
you would call choosy.

33:31.844 --> 33:34.097
Did you ever see
a zombie, Major?

33:34.305 --> 33:36.015
Yeah, you know,
I see them all the time.

33:36.224 --> 33:39.519
Real zombies.
Old-school zombies.
Horrible creatures.

33:39.727 --> 33:41.688
That's why we got
all the safety doors.

33:43.189 --> 33:44.148
Yeah...

33:45.024 --> 33:46.693
All right.

33:46.901 --> 33:48.736
Vaughn? The door.

33:48.945 --> 33:51.322
Yeah. Shh, it's good.
It's okay.

33:51.531 --> 33:53.533
- I mean, there's
so many buttons here.
- Vaughn?

33:53.700 --> 33:55.034
I think this is
the light switch.

33:57.245 --> 33:58.204
There they are.

33:58.413 --> 34:00.915
Come on, people.
Look alive-ish.

34:01.124 --> 34:02.667
Please open this immediately!

34:02.875 --> 34:03.710
Yeah. Yeah.

34:03.918 --> 34:06.254
Vaughn! Open the damn door!

34:06.462 --> 34:08.047
Open the damn door!

34:08.256 --> 34:10.299
- Wonder how'd they'd fight...
- Vaughn! Vaughn!

34:10.508 --> 34:11.634
If that was fresh.

34:13.302 --> 34:14.887
Open the damn door!

34:15.096 --> 34:16.556
- Yeah, can't hear you.
- Just let me out of here.

34:16.764 --> 34:18.307
Help me. Help me.

34:18.516 --> 34:21.352
For the love of God,
just let me out of here.
Just let me out!

34:23.396 --> 34:24.564
You did it, my boy.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.360
You did it, you did it!

34:29.569 --> 34:30.945
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to put you through that.

34:31.154 --> 34:32.864
You, too, Doc. Sorry.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.490
So, he's not a whistle-blower?

34:34.699 --> 34:36.743
No, no. Of course not.
It was just a charade, man.

34:36.951 --> 34:40.413
It was a test.
And you passed
with flying colors!

34:40.621 --> 34:43.916
Hooray! Oh! Yeah!

34:44.125 --> 34:47.628
This says Starlee and
Wyatt are both in HMW,
whatever that is.

34:47.837 --> 34:49.630
Hair, makeup, wardrobe.

34:49.839 --> 34:51.758
Look. Jordan's new Porsche.

34:51.966 --> 34:54.427
Really, dude?
A rag-top in Seattle?

34:54.635 --> 34:55.970
Perfect for L.A., though.

35:01.934 --> 35:03.394
What the hell?

35:05.730 --> 35:07.607
Whoever did this,

35:07.815 --> 35:09.067
I'm coming for you!

35:14.947 --> 35:17.283
- Talk to me.
- Jordan's car.

35:17.492 --> 35:20.244
Someone filled it with dirt,
and stuck in a tombstone
for Jenny Hulce.

35:20.453 --> 35:22.455
The crew member who
fell asleep at the wheel
driving home

35:22.663 --> 35:23.956
after Jordan kept the crew
shooting all night?

35:24.165 --> 35:25.750
And the only other person
we know who died.

35:25.958 --> 35:28.002
So, who cared enough
to kill Jordan over that?

35:28.211 --> 35:30.755
Besides everyone who got
a "Never Forget" tattoo?

35:36.135 --> 35:38.513
I don't blame my wife's death
on Jordan Mason Marsh,

35:38.721 --> 35:39.847
if that's what you're asking.

35:40.056 --> 35:41.808
Sounds like
you blame someone.

35:42.016 --> 35:43.768
I don't know. Maybe Jenny?

35:44.685 --> 35:46.354
I told her to quit.

35:46.562 --> 35:49.190
She always complained
about her job, but
she wouldn't give it up.

35:49.398 --> 35:50.942
Guess she had her reasons.

35:51.150 --> 35:54.529
We saw the "Never Forget"
tattoos on the cast and crew.

35:54.737 --> 35:56.781
Your wife must have
been pretty beloved.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.616
More beloved by
some than others.

36:03.454 --> 36:06.374
I'm sending
it over as we speak.
On the house.

36:06.582 --> 36:08.459
I'm even throwing in
a little something extra.

36:11.379 --> 36:13.256
Hope you like to party.

36:13.464 --> 36:17.718
Again, in my defense,
I would describe the
deceased as slender.

36:17.927 --> 36:20.138
We didn't realize
she was bulimic.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.014
Yeah.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.975
I'm gonna bring
over the replacement
brains personally.

36:24.183 --> 36:27.603
Mmm-hmm. Bye.

36:27.812 --> 36:31.440
I told you, you need to
take the yellow coolers
out of circulation.

36:31.649 --> 36:32.984
They noted them
in the FBI report.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.904
All the others are out.

36:48.541 --> 36:49.959
John Deaux?

36:50.168 --> 36:52.587
I'm Agent Dale Bozzio, FBI.
Is this a bad time?

36:52.795 --> 36:54.088
Not at all.

37:02.763 --> 37:05.183
It's so terrible, what's
been happening to all
those poor rich people

37:05.391 --> 37:06.392
disappearing like that.

37:06.601 --> 37:07.602
Do you think they're dead?

37:07.810 --> 37:10.021
I'm afraid
I can't comment on that.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.316
I'm just following up
on a phone number
registered in your name.

37:13.524 --> 37:16.027
We found it in two
of our victims' phones.

37:16.235 --> 37:18.196
I'm sorry, which number?
I've got a few.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.533
Oh, that's a business line.

37:22.742 --> 37:24.660
Do you recognize
either of the victims' names?

37:24.869 --> 37:26.204
Tim Addis? Judy Holt?

37:26.412 --> 37:27.788
A lot of people
call that number.

37:27.997 --> 37:30.082
Uh...

37:30.291 --> 37:33.502
They're asking about
casket styles, upholstery
options, vermin resistance.

37:33.711 --> 37:36.547
Two relatively young
people who called the
same funeral home?

37:36.756 --> 37:38.883
Young people
call all the time.

37:39.091 --> 37:40.801
Generally, on the
behalf of old people.

37:41.010 --> 37:42.220
Ah.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.847
Let me give the database
a little look-see.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.604
Um...

37:55.858 --> 37:57.401
I'm sorry.

37:57.610 --> 38:00.404
I don't show either of those
poor souls in our system.

38:00.613 --> 38:02.531
I hope they made
arrangements elsewhere.

38:02.740 --> 38:06.160
Guessing it's a moot
point when there are
no bodies to bury.

38:06.369 --> 38:08.120
If you can think
of anything else...

38:09.413 --> 38:10.373
Here.

38:13.626 --> 38:14.919
You're a big fella.

38:15.127 --> 38:16.420
In an unrecovered
body situation,

38:16.629 --> 38:18.381
many people opt for
an empty casket,

38:18.589 --> 38:20.258
it can help create
a feeling of normalcy.

38:20.466 --> 38:23.219
You know, death
being not ambiguous.

38:23.427 --> 38:24.470
Good to know.

38:26.097 --> 38:27.431
You know
why you're here, Fitz.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.809
As prop master,
you figured you could slip

38:30.017 --> 38:33.229
that.45 into the hands
of Jordan's clueless
co-star, Wyatt.

38:33.437 --> 38:35.314
He was well-known
for losing track of it.

38:35.523 --> 38:38.109
And in the meantime,
you terrorized Jordan.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.069
Defecated in his trailer.

38:40.278 --> 38:43.114
Ruined the interior
of his Porsche.

38:43.322 --> 38:45.783
Working those long hours,
the crew must really bond.

38:45.992 --> 38:47.827
Especially the ones
sleeping together.

38:48.035 --> 38:50.204
Like you and Assistant
Director Jenny Hulce.

38:50.413 --> 38:54.667
Who fell asleep at
the wheel after Jordan kept
the crew working all night.

38:54.875 --> 38:57.044
Yeah, Jenny's husband
told me about the affair.

38:57.253 --> 38:58.421
He knew.

39:00.089 --> 39:02.216
You didn't tell me
you were bringing him in.

39:02.425 --> 39:03.551
Must have slipped my mind.

39:03.759 --> 39:05.469
I thought
I was back on the team.

39:05.678 --> 39:08.639
I told you how this
was going to go, Liv.
Day-by-day.

39:08.848 --> 39:11.767
So, now what? I'm
supposed to just sit in the
morgue, twiddling my thumbs?

39:11.976 --> 39:13.477
You're supposed
to do your job.

39:13.686 --> 39:15.730
It's down there,
not here with me.

39:15.938 --> 39:19.358
I am not going to just leave,
so you can bully him
into a Murder One rap.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.944
He deserves even worse
than life without parole.

39:22.153 --> 39:23.696
D.A. thinks we can get
the death penalty.

39:23.904 --> 39:25.573
It was a crime of passion!

39:25.781 --> 39:28.826
It came months after
his lover died.
It was calculated.

39:29.035 --> 39:30.578
It's Murder Two, at most.

39:32.872 --> 39:34.832
This isn't some monster.

39:35.041 --> 39:37.460
I've met monsters.

39:37.668 --> 39:39.420
This is a guy who lost
the woman he loved

39:39.628 --> 39:41.505
and just needed
someone to blame.

39:43.007 --> 39:44.133
She's right.

39:46.844 --> 39:49.138
I hated Jordan
for the accident.

39:49.347 --> 39:51.682
But when I heard
that they were moving
the show to L.A.,

39:51.891 --> 39:54.560
just so Jordan could be
an even bigger star, I...

39:55.686 --> 39:56.937
I snapped.

39:58.314 --> 40:00.941
That's the day I handed
Wyatt the real.45.

40:02.860 --> 40:04.612
It was a split-second
decision.

40:11.619 --> 40:12.703
Oh, yeah.

40:12.912 --> 40:14.330
Oh, we can go
like this all night.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.713
You think Dr. Lockett will
forgive you for actually

40:22.922 --> 40:24.548
releasing those
Romeros on him?

40:24.757 --> 40:26.342
Rehearsal's one thing.

40:26.550 --> 40:32.014
But when it comes to playing
full-on, pant-soiling terror,

40:32.223 --> 40:35.059
nothing beats having a
hungry zombie on your ass.

40:35.267 --> 40:38.896
<i>You must be
pleased Major passed
your loyalty test.</i>

40:39.105 --> 40:40.940
<i>Our boy has seen the light.</i>

40:42.858 --> 40:44.443
This isn't some monster.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.905
I've met monsters.

40:51.325 --> 40:53.077
You were really good in there.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.329
I guess you figured
out your motivation.

40:55.538 --> 40:56.664
My motivation?

40:57.748 --> 40:59.333
That was easy.

40:59.542 --> 41:00.751
Team back up with you.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.629
I told you,
that's what I live for.

41:05.214 --> 41:07.007
Hey, don't leave
on my account.

41:07.216 --> 41:08.467
Oh, it's okay, Dale.

41:10.261 --> 41:11.220
Liv.

41:13.556 --> 41:14.640
See you tomorrow.

41:19.103 --> 41:21.939
Interesting lead on
the Chaos Killer case.

41:22.148 --> 41:23.774
The vic who went
missing in Seward Park...

41:23.983 --> 41:25.151
Colin Andrews,
guy with the dog?

41:25.359 --> 41:27.778
Good memory.

41:27.987 --> 41:30.156
It's probably nothing, but we
just learned his pooch had one
of those GPS tracking devices.

41:30.364 --> 41:31.449
Gonna run it down tomorrow.

41:31.657 --> 41:32.825
Mmm, maybe you'll get lucky.

41:33.826 --> 41:34.869
Maybe.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.252
Who's this?

41:43.461 --> 41:46.630
Uh, a suspect in the
Meat Cute Massacre. Why?

41:46.839 --> 41:48.799
I just met him.

41:49.008 --> 41:51.552
Two of my missing
presumed-dead guys
had his phone number on them.

41:53.929 --> 41:55.097
This is our guy!
