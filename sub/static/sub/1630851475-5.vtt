WEBVTT

00:07.799 --> 00:08.758
Hey.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.843
Hey!

00:09.926 --> 00:11.886
Hmm. That's a good squish.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.680
-Bulgogi's almost there.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.765
Have fun out at Uncle's ranch today.

00:15.849 --> 00:16.933
I will.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.644
I just wish Lahela could go with me
like when she was little,

00:19.728 --> 00:21.104
but now she's always so busy.

00:21.187 --> 00:24.232
Mm. It's been forever
since I've been out there, too.

00:25.483 --> 00:28.278
Can I please buy you a proper bowl,

00:28.361 --> 00:31.948
one that maybe didn't expire in 1989?

00:32.032 --> 00:35.243
No need to spend your hard-earned money
on somethin' fancy like that.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.370
This guy works just as good for you,
more better.

00:37.454 --> 00:42.125
Oh, I love how your Pidgin really pops
when you're passionate.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.008
Hey, you're supposed to be
practicing hula.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.094
And you're supposed
to be prepping for the SAT,

00:53.178 --> 00:55.430
not using your book as a sun-shield.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.848
I'm in recovery.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.684
Let my muscles regen
before the next hula show.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.227
Ooh, that's tight.

01:01.311 --> 01:04.272
No procrastinating.

01:04.355 --> 01:08.026
"Failing to prepare is preparing to fail."

01:08.109 --> 01:10.653
Legendary basketball coach, John Wooden.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.989
Yeah, I'm not into team sports.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.699
Here you go.
I wrote my name on the bottom.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.701
Make sure you get it back.
That's my best Tupperware.

01:16.785 --> 01:20.246
Oh, the good whipped cream tub. Fancy.

01:22.332 --> 01:25.335
Yes! Nothing like
a four-hour cholecystectomy

01:25.418 --> 01:27.170
to leave you jonesing for more.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.714
What's next? Feed the beast.
What do we got on the big board?

01:30.298 --> 01:34.260
We got a Canadian tourist
who fell off a moped in 1C.

01:34.344 --> 01:38.598
Aw, man. I need something challenging
to sink my teeth into.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.434
You should have finished that
cholecystectomy in three and a half hours,

01:41.518 --> 01:44.687
-because my new case? Sepsis.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.147
You're so lucky.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.066
Organ failure for me. Whoop-whoop.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.320
Hey, I know you love a tough case,

01:52.403 --> 01:54.823
but you don't always need
to have a puzzle to solve.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.116
Oh, and I bet you're handling

01:56.199 --> 01:58.743
the same kind
of run-of-the-mill cases, too?

01:59.702 --> 02:02.789
Necrotizing fasciitis.

02:02.872 --> 02:06.000
Come on! A flesh-eating disease?

02:06.084 --> 02:07.669
So unfair.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.295
Ooh, flesh-eating disease.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.630
Hey, what are you doing here?

02:10.713 --> 02:11.548
I came to visit you.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.174
Oh, that's so nice.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.676
And to score some
of the chocolate chip cookies

02:14.759 --> 02:16.344
they give to the ladies
who just gave birth.

02:16.427 --> 02:17.595
Your paycheck.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.348
Oh, wait. But Gail,
my checks are always direct deposited.

02:20.431 --> 02:24.435
They switched accounting systems
to make my life as difficult as possible.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.020
But if you don't want the check,

02:26.104 --> 02:28.940
I was thinking about
upgrading my beer fridge.

02:29.023 --> 02:31.693
Nope. We're good. Thanks, Gail.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.532
We have to spend it. It's a sign.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.701
Like when it was a full moon
on my 13th birthday,

02:39.784 --> 02:42.453
which confirmed I'm a tiny bit wolf.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.165
I've never gotten
a hard copy check before.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.457
I don't even know what I make.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.959
I'm lowering my expectations.

02:48.042 --> 02:50.837
Anytime my mom's family sends me
an envelope for my birthday,

02:50.920 --> 02:52.297
it's always a two-dollar bill.

02:52.881 --> 02:56.092
I mean, it's cool, but it's two dollars.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.010
Okay.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.184
-I'm rich.
-We're rich!

03:35.882 --> 03:38.051
CLARA HANNON, MD
CHIEF OF MEDICINE

03:39.761 --> 03:41.930
Oh, Dr. Choi, if you have a minute,

03:42.013 --> 03:44.307
I'd love to talk about
the Chief of Staff position.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.809
Oh, um, can this wait?
I'm in a bit of a rush.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.811
I'm transitioning
to the Lakers medical staff.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.355
You know, Los Angeles Lakers.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.399
-Yeah, the pro basketball team.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.611
-How do you like me now, Greg?

03:56.694 --> 03:59.906
Oh, sorry. Greg was the coach
who cut me from the JV team.

04:00.615 --> 04:05.245
Well, uh, I just so happen to have some
of my husband's bulgogi with me.

04:05.328 --> 04:09.624
Perhaps later, we can make a reservation
at the break room table by the microwave.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.961
I wish I could,
but I just don't have the bandwidth.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.254
-Hey, Dr. Choi!

04:14.337 --> 04:16.464
Yes! Psyched for our game of hoops.

04:16.547 --> 04:17.840
I'm gonna school you on the court

04:17.924 --> 04:20.426
while you school me
on the ins and outs of Chief of Staff.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.303
What do you mean?

04:22.387 --> 04:24.097
Oh, didn't you hear?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.266
I'm going for Chief of Staff, too.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.726
Great.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.313
I'm competing with the guy
known for hitting on recent widows.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.233
Hey, you miss 100 percent
of the shots you don't take.

04:35.316 --> 04:36.651
Yeah, and at the three-point line,

04:36.734 --> 04:38.987
you miss 100 percent
of the shots you do take.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.783
So, um, there's a lunchtime
basketball game?

04:43.866 --> 04:46.744
Oh, it's just a friendly weekly game
between medical professionals.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.579
That's fun.

04:48.663 --> 04:52.667
So is there any time
that's good for us to talk?

04:52.750 --> 04:55.545
Oh, uh, well, between my basketball game
and my social calendar,

04:55.628 --> 04:57.588
-it's tough. It... Oh...

04:58.172 --> 04:59.299
It's Jason Momoa.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.136
What up, J-Money?

05:03.553 --> 05:05.805
Huh? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll hold.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.767
-He does this.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.027
Hey, what up, J-Money?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.821
Can I listen?

05:21.904 --> 05:24.782
-Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be in touch.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.285
-DR.About that, well, I...

05:27.368 --> 05:30.288
DR.Oh, yeah? Yeah. Definitely.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.337
Solid shopping spree.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.421
I look iconic,

05:38.504 --> 05:41.215
and you're serving enough Big Robe Energy
to power the whole island.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.719
And you're a monocle away
from being a sexy Mrs. Monopoly man.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.804
-Turns out, I like being rich.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.598
Hey, you know those sneakers I wanted?

05:48.681 --> 05:50.141
Well, I found them online.

05:50.224 --> 05:53.936
But this site called "DripFlip" says
they're only available to bid on.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.980
You don't know DripFlip?

05:58.733 --> 06:00.651
I love it when I know things you don't.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.655
DripFlip is a website

06:04.739 --> 06:07.575
where sneakerheads buy and sell
limited-edition sneakers and stuff.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.328
Matt Unterberger made 91 bucks on there.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.164
Apparently not enough
to get his teeth fixed.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.311
Ooh.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.730
Yeah.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.443
He got some juice in this one.

06:43.027 --> 06:43.945
Whoa, Uncle.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.322
It's always great to come back here
to where I grew up.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.824
So many memories.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.909
Your father and I used to camp
under that tree.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.328
One of my favorites.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.330
Coming here always recharges me.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.875
The only thing that would make this better
is if Lahela were here.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.252
Then where is she?

06:59.335 --> 07:00.837
Ah, you know how it is for teenagers.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.923
Boys, clothes, getting published
in medical journals.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.175
We'll get her next time.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.761
Next time? Well, you know how that goes.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.014
I know your father would have liked
to spend more time with you.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.434
-Come, let's go to the house.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.440
One, two, three.

07:21.566 --> 07:22.400
Oh.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.485
-- So close.
-- Looked cool for a miss.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.112
Guys, come on.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.990
-This looks a lot like slacking off.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.283
It's not.

07:30.366 --> 07:34.996
There's a geometry section on the SATs,
and basketball is basically geometry.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.247
You know, angles and whatnot.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.959
And I burned my hula skirt
trying to make pancakes.

07:40.042 --> 07:43.588
There's nothing left
of the hula skirt or the pancakes.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.548
What did we talk about?

07:45.631 --> 07:48.926
You have to put the work in
to attain your goals.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.554
Well, are you Chief of Staff yet?

07:53.139 --> 07:54.557
No.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.268
I can't get face time with Dr. Choi.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.563
See? You prepared,
and you didn't get squat.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.522
So what's the point?

08:01.606 --> 08:04.609
No, you can't think like that.

08:07.361 --> 08:08.446
Pass me the rock.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.032
Come on.

08:14.243 --> 08:17.413
Remember how I said
I used to play ball growing up?

08:17.497 --> 08:21.626
Honed my skills
at Dr. J Basketball Camp in the Poconos.

08:21.709 --> 08:25.546
He's who first inspired me
to become a doctor.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.925
I played in grade school, junior high.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.470
That all led to this.

08:33.888 --> 08:38.226
I'm gonna get in that game,
win over Dr. Choi,

08:38.309 --> 08:42.104
and show you fools
what happens when you prepare.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.898
Did Mom just call us fools?

08:43.981 --> 08:44.941
Yup.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.366
Oh... Nothing but plant!

08:59.914 --> 09:01.457
This DripFlip thing is tight.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.126
You just buy sneakers
and sell them for more money.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.211
It's all math!

09:07.129 --> 09:08.172
I'm out!

09:08.256 --> 09:09.632
I can tell you're Lahela-ing this.

09:10.216 --> 09:14.136
I can think of like eight positive
definitions of what "Lahela-ing" would be,

09:14.220 --> 09:16.222
but my guess is you're gonna go negative.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.849
You always need a project
or something to work on.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.726
Like a shark. You gotta keep moving.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.478
Actually, sharks don't have
to keep moving.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.563
They sleep in caves.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.983
Dr. Eugenie Clark proved that.
I like to fact-check Shark Week.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.192
Enough Lahela-ing.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.195
Have fun making sneakers about math. Bye.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.321
Bye.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.036
Boys, check it out.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.205
I found my old b-ball stuff.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.499
Oh, look!

09:44.166 --> 09:46.961
My old senior photo.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.922
Looks like a five-foot wave
on top of your head.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.591
And no wonder Dad fell in love with you.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.843
He probably just
wanted to surf on your hair.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.720
Oh.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.805
My lucky pumps.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.391
I used to dominate in these.

10:00.474 --> 10:03.519
I was so good, they called me Clarry Bird.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.354
Hey, how's it going?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.480
Hey.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.816
Feel like a little father-daughter hang?

10:09.358 --> 10:10.818
In the mood for a surf?

10:10.901 --> 10:13.654
Oh, this pair now goes for 280 dollars?

10:13.738 --> 10:16.616
-Just an hour ago, it was 240 dollars.
-What is this?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.784
DripFlip. It's a resale site for sneakers.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.120
I'm looking for a crispy clean pair
of OG Supremes,

10:21.203 --> 10:22.496
but you gotta time the market.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.707
It's all about buying low
and selling high.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.918
Wait, this kind of sounds
like the stock market.

10:28.002 --> 10:28.961
Yeah.

10:29.045 --> 10:33.049
Only cooler, because it's sneakers
and not, like, banks and chemicals.

10:34.258 --> 10:38.262
Lahela, you know I was a stock trader
before we had you kids, huh?

10:39.388 --> 10:42.350
Right. Wait, so you know
how to do this stuff?

10:42.433 --> 10:46.103
No offense, I just can't picture you
with a long sleeve shirt job.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.563
None taken, but yes.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.816
I had a very different life way back when.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.820
<i>The year 2000, we just survived Y2K.</i>

10:54.904 --> 10:56.405
<i>Every male friendship was tinged</i>

10:56.489 --> 10:58.616
<i>with the lessons we all learned
from</i> Fight Club.

10:58.699 --> 11:02.119
<i>My favorite song was</i> I Hope You Dance
<i>by Lee Ann Womack.</i>

11:02.995 --> 11:04.705
<i>Jeans were low, stocks were high.</i>

11:04.789 --> 11:06.832
Dad. The sneakers are just getting
more expensive.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.751
-Can we jump ahead?
-Of course.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.711
<i>Energy drinks were all the rage.</i>

11:10.795 --> 11:12.463
<i>Monster, Red Bull.</i>

11:12.546 --> 11:14.590
<i>But the real champs drank Nuked.</i>

11:14.674 --> 11:16.258
<i>"Go nuclear, with Nuked."</i>

11:16.342 --> 11:18.177
-Dad!
-Uh, I'm sorry.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.513
Nobody pays for music
when you can download a song for free

11:20.596 --> 11:22.932
in only 45 minutes... sell!

11:23.015 --> 11:24.266
<i>I was in a fast-paced office</i>

11:24.350 --> 11:27.645
<i>in the building next to the people
who invented online dating for farmers.</i>

11:31.482 --> 11:33.067
<i>And there was something called a "panini"</i>

11:33.150 --> 11:35.111
<i>that was changing the way
we all thought about lunch.</i>

11:43.744 --> 11:45.371
This one's for you, Cubes.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.877
It took 45 minutes to download one song?

11:51.961 --> 11:54.255
The wait made you want it more.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.674
-God, the past was so slow.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.553
The price just went down
on those new sneakers.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.015
You know, if you think it's valuable,

12:05.099 --> 12:07.935
you should buy multiple pairs,
make a bigger profit.

12:08.644 --> 12:11.897
I always said,
"You gotta risk it to get the biscuit."

12:13.357 --> 12:14.567
I like that.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.903
Hey, do you wanna team up?

12:18.487 --> 12:20.072
We could do it together.

12:20.781 --> 12:21.782
Really?

12:22.283 --> 12:24.994
Boys, gather round.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.082
In this family,
if we're gonna do something,

12:30.166 --> 12:32.543
we're gonna do it 100 percent.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.963
Uh-oh. Is this another
"Philly versus Everybody" thing?

12:36.046 --> 12:39.091
Yeah, I don't need to hear about it again.
It's so aggro over there.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.509
Tough accent, too.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.470
I don't care if you are my sons.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.765
Get my city's name
out of your mouths and listen up.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.393
To get Chief of Staff,
I have to be the best,

12:49.477 --> 12:52.605
not just at the hospital,
but on the court, too.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.274
How do I do that?

12:56.942 --> 12:59.737
Good old-fashioned preparation.

13:04.658 --> 13:07.119
Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.913
Faster. Faster.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.118
Okay.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.941
-You look like you're hitting it hard.
-The boys are training me up real good.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.902
I'm furthering my career,
teaching the kids a lesson,

14:21.986 --> 14:23.404
and getting into sick shape.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.406
-Who said moms can't have it all?

14:25.489 --> 14:26.448
I love it.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.200
Me and Lahela are really bonding, too.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.911
I haven't had this much time with her
since we both got mono.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.497
-Amazing! Look at us.
-Look at us!

14:41.714 --> 14:42.590
Let's go!

15:07.114 --> 15:09.033
That game was crazy.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.493
You caught fire, man.
What an epic comeback.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.371
Hey, if I can lead a group
of doctors like that on the court,

15:14.455 --> 15:16.332
just imagine what I could do
as Chief of Staff.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.669
Dr. Lee-bron from the nurses' station!

15:22.254 --> 15:25.299
Not my house. That goes in recycling.

15:25.382 --> 15:28.302
-Swatted away by Hannon. Wow.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.596
I used to ball back in the day.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.265
Two-time all-defense in the Quaker League.

15:33.349 --> 15:37.061
In fact, I was thinking
about joining your game.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.649
I don't know about that.
It can get pretty savage out there.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.692
After I'm done with you,

15:44.276 --> 15:46.528
you won't be able
to show your face in the cafeteria.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.239
Oh, yeah.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.784
Well, when I'm done with you,

15:52.201 --> 15:55.454
you'll need a toe tag
because you're gonna end up in the morgue.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.753
What I'm saying is I'm bringing my A-game.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.340
And also, we should
discuss morgue protocol

16:06.423 --> 16:08.342
at the next senior staff meeting.

16:08.425 --> 16:09.635
Right, right.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.637
Yeah, we actually should talk about that.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.514
-Good idea, Clara.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.933
That's a good idea.

16:17.393 --> 16:21.522
Turns out, my patient caught
a nasty parasite from some tuna tartare.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.482
So, I hope you all feel really bad
about making fun of me

16:23.565 --> 16:24.817
for microwaving my poke.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.236
My patient with organ failure,
I can't figure out the cause.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.654
Thought I had a lead, then bang!

16:28.737 --> 16:31.115
Pulmonary cryptococcal infection
out of nowhere.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.117
Could be due to sarcoidosis.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.494
Oh, I didn't consider that.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.664
What is up with you?

16:38.747 --> 16:41.667
Not to sound like a '90s dad,
but you've been on your phone all morning.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.460
Dang it! I lost another one.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.632
Sorry, I started trading sneakers,
and my profits are tumbling.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.135
I went big on a pair of Yeezys
and now I'm in the red.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.137
It's 1929 up in here.

16:53.887 --> 16:58.183
Okay, Dr. Hannon.
Staying fly in scrubs and saving lives.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.185
Who gave you permission?

17:00.269 --> 17:02.563
What? Fun can't be functional?

17:02.646 --> 17:05.941
-Those shoes are so hot online right now.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.277
Ariana Grande just wore them
to Whole Foods.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.988
Am I too old to know this?

17:11.071 --> 17:12.322
Not at all.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.534
Just like I'm not too old
to be shopping at Urban Outfitters.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.372
Hey, I'm making your sister
a breakfast panini.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.665
You guys want one?

17:22.249 --> 17:24.918
The breakfast panini
is the most important panini of the day.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.921
Dad, it's been so much panini.
It's like we live in an airport.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.257
Yeah. Can I just have
a raw sandwich today?

17:30.966 --> 17:32.342
My pumps are gone.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.179
I left them right outside
and now they've vanished.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.680
Somebody probably swiped them.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.892
Ever since my girl Ari rocked them
in the produce aisle,

17:39.975 --> 17:43.020
the pumps have kind of become
"the shoe" overnight.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.105
I need them for my game.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.191
-It's today.
-You'll find them, honey.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.776
Yeah, maybe you left them
down by the beach.

17:48.859 --> 17:49.902
We'll help you look.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.198
Here's your breakfast panini
for another great day of trading

17:54.281 --> 17:55.365
and father-daughter bonding!

17:59.244 --> 18:02.790
-Wait, you sold Mom's sneakers?

18:02.873 --> 18:04.458
I got us back in the black!

18:04.541 --> 18:07.419
Since when were we not in the black?
I thought we were doing this together.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.588
Well, there was a lot of action overnight
in the Asian markets.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.298
Sneakers never sleep.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.342
I found this pair
of limited edition high tops

18:13.425 --> 18:15.010
that I was positive
we could flip for cash.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.262
Made a tiny miscalculation on their value.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.973
But by selling Mom's shoes
at their peak price,

18:20.057 --> 18:21.016
I got our money back.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.227
Like you said,
"You got to risk it to get the biscuit."

18:23.310 --> 18:25.687
Yeah, I was talking about stocks,
not Mom's shoes.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.231
Don't worry, I sold high.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.317
The market will cool itself in a few days,
and I'll buy them back at a profit.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.568
No harm done.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.280
Mom has her big basketball game
at the hospital today.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.407
What does that mean?

18:38.575 --> 18:40.869
She's been trying
to get face time with Dr. Choi,

18:40.953 --> 18:42.830
so he can recommend her
for Chief of Staff.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.624
And this lunchtime basketball game
is their best chance at it.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.752
She's been practicing all week.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.005
So what do we do?

18:53.340 --> 18:54.424
I have an idea.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.969
You know how to get Mom's sneakers back?

18:57.553 --> 19:00.472
I'm talking about something
even more important than shoes...

19:01.181 --> 19:03.100
Maybe the most important thing of all.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.956
-Why are we at Uncle's ranch?

19:26.957 --> 19:28.250
We're here for balance.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.002
To get you balanced out

19:30.085 --> 19:32.171
and connected again
to everything that matters most.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.006
Dad, I'm fine.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.216
No, you Lahela'd it.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.927
Everyone needs to stop verbing me.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.430
I never thought
being myself could be a bad thing.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.764
It's not bad.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.392
You're a curious kid with a big brain.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.269
It's what makes you a brilliant doctor,

19:47.352 --> 19:50.606
but it's also why it tends
to get you sucked into things.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.152
We overdid it with DripFlip.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.487
It's time to take a step back.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.501
This is nice, right?

20:12.127 --> 20:13.503
Look at those mountains.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.673
How beautiful is that?

20:18.634 --> 20:20.594
Now, I want you
to just take a deep breath.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.015
Go on.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.646
Now take another one.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.732
Because there's a lot of Nuked
we need to get out of your system.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.283
Feel better, right?

20:44.326 --> 20:45.744
And this is just the start.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.414
Come on! I wanna show you
a stream I can jump.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.239
Oh, what kind of store is this?

21:22.322 --> 21:25.617
You don't have any 1994 Reebok pumps
in a size seven?

21:26.201 --> 21:28.870
My mom lost her lucky sneakers,
and she needs to use them

21:28.954 --> 21:32.791
for a pickup basketball game at work
so she can infiltrate the boys' club

21:32.874 --> 21:35.502
and impress the outgoing
hospital Chief of Staff.

21:35.585 --> 21:36.920
Dope.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.380
My boss is a woman.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.341
These ones aren't right either.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.969
Well, unless you wanna try
some, uh, water shoes,

21:44.052 --> 21:45.595
that's the only pair we have left.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.015
No, thank you.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.558
Just forget it.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.895
I can't play without my pumps.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.314
It's over.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.357
No point in going to the game now.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.321
You're not gonna play after all of that?

22:02.404 --> 22:04.531
We're your impressionable sons.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.658
Is that really the lesson
you want us to learn?

22:06.742 --> 22:08.327
That we should give up?

22:08.410 --> 22:12.039
Oh, don't use me
being a good mom against me.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.291
Mom, you're not good because of the shoes.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.585
You're good because you prepared.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.254
It's like "you are the pump."

22:21.423 --> 22:22.632
That's a metaphor.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.218
SATs, baby.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.013
Hm. Maybe you're right.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.890
Technically, it's a simile, though.

22:30.640 --> 22:34.186
I just didn't think
Philly was a place for quitters.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.731
You've been preparing
for this moment your whole life,

22:38.065 --> 22:42.027
ever since you dropped eight points
against Bensalem Junior High.

22:42.110 --> 22:42.986
Yeah, Mom.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.947
It's like those wise words
from that basketball man you told us about

22:46.031 --> 22:47.616
when I started to daydream.

22:54.539 --> 22:58.377
Thank you for reminding me
of what I reminded you,

22:58.460 --> 23:01.755
of what the great John Wooden
reminded us all.

23:02.297 --> 23:06.051
"Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.

23:06.134 --> 23:10.222
And when you put the work in
you owe it to yourself to show up."

23:13.558 --> 23:16.311
Time to kick some doctor butt.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.437
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

23:17.521 --> 23:19.731
Hell yeah! Go, hot mom.

23:19.815 --> 23:20.774
Okay, let's go.

23:20.857 --> 23:23.068
Come on. Come on. Come on.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.904
Hot mom.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.240
This is nice.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.451
Feels like I'm in a YA novel.

23:31.535 --> 23:35.747
All I'm missing are horse boots
and a supernatural problematic boyfriend.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.417
It's nice having you here.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.793
You're right.

23:40.377 --> 23:41.586
I needed this.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.798
I can't believe I got so into DripFlip,

23:44.881 --> 23:47.384
-I sold Mom's sneakers.

23:47.467 --> 23:48.969
I feel terrible.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.637
I do, too.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.889
Why do you feel bad?

23:55.016 --> 23:56.351
I never told you this,

23:57.602 --> 23:59.729
but, uh, same thing
happened to me years ago.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.523
You stole from Mom?

24:01.606 --> 24:03.400
No. She was in med school.

24:03.483 --> 24:04.901
She had nothing to steal.

24:06.903 --> 24:10.657
I got so sucked into my work that
it made me miss out on time with family.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.909
It's hard to picture you like that.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.369
I was a different man.

24:15.245 --> 24:20.667
But, when my dad, your <i>tutu kane,</i>
passed away suddenly,

24:20.750 --> 24:23.211
I thought about all the times
I silenced his calls

24:23.295 --> 24:24.921
because I was consumed by work.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.758
I figured we'd have plenty of time,
once I got to where I wanted my career,

24:28.842 --> 24:31.303
but... we didn't.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.265
And you don't get that time back.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.561
Is that why you left the business?

24:40.937 --> 24:43.815
That and I really wanted
to sell shave ice.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.901
-It does look fun.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.194
-Oh, it is.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.946
I just love coming to the ranch with you.

24:50.822 --> 24:53.325
This is something we do
as father and daughter

24:53.408 --> 24:55.494
that reminds me of my old man.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.079
-Oh, Dad.
-Mm.

24:58.163 --> 25:01.249
But... I should have stopped you sooner.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.960
I just love spending time with you.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.005
I love spending time with you too.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.809
At 5'5", hailing from
North Penn High School,

25:19.893 --> 25:23.480
in her 18th year of medicine,
Clarry Bird herself,

25:23.563 --> 25:26.983
aka Lil Scrapple, my mom!

25:41.206 --> 25:44.167
See? I told you this would be more fun
than eating in the cafeteria.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.794
Yeah, I do not usually enjoy sports,

25:45.877 --> 25:48.713
but I see blood in Dr. Hannon's eyes,
and I am all about it.

25:48.797 --> 25:49.673
Mm-hm.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.055
Clara, I don't even have the ball.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.723
And you won't get it.

26:05.772 --> 26:06.982
DR.Oh, yeah. Okay.

26:18.868 --> 26:23.498
Not in my house, not in my hospital,
and not in front of my children!

26:25.208 --> 26:26.167
Dude, did you see that?

26:26.251 --> 26:27.294
Dr. Hannon's awesome block,

26:27.377 --> 26:29.963
or how surprisingly good
Dr. Lee looks in shorts?

26:30.046 --> 26:33.091
Right? He has the legs of an ox.

26:33.174 --> 26:35.927
Slap a wagon on those
and take me on the Oregon Trail.

26:36.803 --> 26:39.222
Let's make a pact right now.
We will never discuss this again.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.524
Yes, that counted.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.484
I did not hear a whistle.

26:55.363 --> 26:57.365
Good news is,
if Mom seriously injures anyone,

26:57.449 --> 26:59.034
at least we're already at the hospital.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.870
I can't tell if these guys all suck,

27:02.370 --> 27:06.207
or if Mom is the best basketball player
I've ever seen.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.088
Hey, Dr. Hannon.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.466
-You go way too hard.

27:14.549 --> 27:17.260
Read the room,
we play half-court at lunch.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.595
I mean, look at these guys.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.722
We have to protect Jerry.

27:20.805 --> 27:23.141
They said if he dies,
we can't play basketball anymore.

27:23.224 --> 27:26.978
I just got the one speed.
All gas, no brakes, baby.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.314
This is a friendly lunchtime game.
Thanks for ruining it.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.487
Dr. Hannon.

27:35.570 --> 27:36.488
Hey.

27:36.571 --> 27:39.866
Uh, I'm sorry if I got a little
too aggressive out there.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.118
Are you kidding? I love the tenacity.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.828
-A regular Candace Parker.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.955
-She's a friend.
-Oh.

27:46.039 --> 27:49.042
They'll be looking for that kind of drive
in the next Chief of Staff.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.752
We should talk about it more over lunch.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.045
How's tomorrow sound?

27:53.213 --> 27:54.964
Great! Thanks.

27:58.718 --> 28:01.137
Mom, you are an absolute savage.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.264
I am proud to be your son.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.101
Aw, you still have to practice hula.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.394
Worth a shot.

28:08.895 --> 28:09.896
Boys.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.283
Mom, I'm sorry.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.954
I heard you didn't need the sneakers,
but still...

28:26.037 --> 28:31.000
And I'm done with DripFlip,
but I did make one final transaction.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.047
Oh.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.591
Thank you, sweetie.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.885
Please tell me
you're joining a basketball league,

28:40.969 --> 28:44.097
because you do not wanna know
what I paid for those bad girls.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.015
Well, maybe you shouldn't have stolen

28:46.099 --> 28:47.267
your mother's shoes.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.310
Didn't think I had to teach that lesson.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.687
Fair.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.815
And I guess you guys were right.

28:53.898 --> 28:57.569
I can get overly focused on one thing.

28:58.653 --> 29:00.989
I know where you get that from.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.117
Dad always says we need balance.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.286
I struggle with it, too.

29:06.953 --> 29:09.581
It's part of why we decided
to live in Hawaii,

29:09.664 --> 29:12.625
to raise you kids
in such a beautiful place.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.503
It helps keep things in perspective.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.214
Yeah.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.468
And Dad made me look at the mountains.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.678
Oh, guy loves a mountain.

29:25.221 --> 29:26.514
Hey. How about this?

29:27.098 --> 29:31.144
You and me keep an eye on each other
if either one of us gets in too deep.

29:31.227 --> 29:32.145
Deal?

29:33.021 --> 29:35.106
-Deal.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.110
Oh, and did you hear?

29:40.195 --> 29:42.947
Jerry's gonna be
in an air boot for four weeks

29:43.031 --> 29:45.992
because he can't handle me in the paint.

29:46.075 --> 29:49.412
-I cannot believe you screamed "No mercy!"

29:49.496 --> 29:51.289
And then dove for a loose ball

29:51.372 --> 29:53.041
-at your boss's legs...
-Yeah.

29:53.124 --> 29:55.668
-...and then got rewarded for it.
-Yeah. It was epic.

29:57.921 --> 30:02.050
Hey, guys, just a short video today
since I am going off the grid for a bit.

30:02.634 --> 30:06.012
Sometimes, we can all get
too focused on one thing.

30:06.095 --> 30:09.307
I know when I find something
I'm interested in, I go hard.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.226
And that's mostly been a good thing.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.520
That's how I became a doctor at 16.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.606
But I see now how it can also mess me up.

30:16.689 --> 30:19.192
Luckily, I have my parents...

30:19.901 --> 30:22.278
and Hawaii to balance me out.

30:22.695 --> 30:26.991
So don't be afraid to disconnect
and focus on what really matters.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.662
Plus, as a doctor,
I cannot condone vlogging while riding.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.539
-Bye, guys.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.082
All right, let's go.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.921
-- Let's go.
-- You ready?

30:40.004 --> 30:41.047
Yeah.

30:42.841 --> 30:46.553
Okay. Now,
I want us all to take a deep breath.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.471
Of course, you do.
