No!

01:28.960 --> 01:30.560
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:06.680 --> 02:08.759
- Annette, what a super outfit.
- Thanks.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.280
I'm forever telling Pru she should
make a bit of an effort and it'll
take years off you.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.320
Let me get you a drink.
Annette, gin and bitter lemon?

02:28.760 --> 02:31.800
What will you do with yourself
now you're back from Harvard?

02:31.840 --> 02:35.480
He's gonna work at the supermarket
for his old man. Learn the ropes.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.960
Er, just for the summer.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.760
- TV: Come to Richardsons supermarket...
- Dad?

02:45.120 --> 02:46.480
Who's had the Savoy Truffle?

02:54.040 --> 02:56.960
- Is there anything in it?
(SIGHS) - Who knows?

02:58.280 --> 03:00.360
Well, deal with it, Ivor.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.800
Christ, what do I pay you for?
Remind me.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.600
You're a manager, aren't you?
Manage!

03:43.480 --> 03:47.440
LEO: I don't take kindly to being
hustled about a police station like
a criminal!

03:47.480 --> 03:48.720
Who do you think you are?

03:48.760 --> 03:52.320
POLICE OFFICER: Calm down, sir, I'm
just trying to do my job.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.320
Will this take much longer? It's
ridiculous.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.320
I felt ill and my husband agreed to
run me home.

04:00.360 --> 04:04.120
Well, perhaps if you didn't drink so
much you wouldn't feel quite so ill.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.120
You're very rude.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.480
No, Mrs Richardson, I am very busy.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.760
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:13.880 --> 04:17.120
- Are you going to charge them?
- Apparently not.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.000
But you might want to remind your
father, when he's sobered up,

04:20.040 --> 04:23.200
that another month and the new Road
Safety Act comes into law.

04:23.240 --> 04:27.360
- It won't matter who he plays golf with then.
- I'm sorry if you were put to any trouble.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.920
- Well, it's not your fault.
- It will be.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.320
- You took your time.
- I was out.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.560
Who were you saving this evening?
Yellow ones or little brown ones?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.560
Little red ones, actually.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.000
All right, all right. Not tonight,
for Christ's sake.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.760
- Come on.
- Constable Nixon will see you out.

(ALARM CLOCK TICKING)

05:08.160 --> 05:09.440
Aghh!

05:45.320 --> 05:48.880
Brigade had to axe their way through.
Morning, matey.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.760
- Who's the, er...?
- Simon Hallward. Early 20s.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.520
What is he, some sort of artist or
something?

05:57.560 --> 06:01.040
According to Mrs Cravat, his
landlady. Lived here about 18 months.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.960
It's turps.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.680
- Next of kin?
- I've got Shirley talking to the neighbours.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.920
Woman Police Constable Trewlove.
She's new.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.080
(CLEARS THROAT)

06:18.120 --> 06:21.160
Overcome by smoke most likely.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.760
The fire's done the rest.

06:24.800 --> 06:28.040
- Any idea as to cause?
- Cigarette, left burning.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.520
Room full of solvents.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.240
Runners and riders,
once I've completed the post-mortem.

06:50.440 --> 06:54.960
Sheer hooliganism. Throwing members
of the public off the towpath?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.880
The boys' colleges have been spoken
to.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.880
They'll be gated for the rest of the
term, but the victim didn't want to
press charges.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.160
- They bought him off, I suppose.
- Offered to pay for his dry-cleaning.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.360
- Anything else?
- Morse is looking into
a fatal fire in Jericho.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.880
Oh, and DC Parrish rang in sick this
morning. Tummy bug.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.800
- How many does that make?
- Three, sir, in CID.

07:13.840 --> 07:17.080
And five on 'B' Relief. Much more of
it, we'll have to bus in reserves.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.040
- You're all right, are you?
- As ninepence, sir. Touch wood.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.040
Trewlove? I'm Detective Morse.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.840
- Anything germane?
- Not much.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.000
The deceased moved in a year ago
last February.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.720
Nobody saw much of him.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.160
Out at his studio in the day,
in the Turf most nights.

07:34.200 --> 07:38.040
- Friends? Girlfriend?
- One or two models but no names, I'm afraid.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.640
Last person to see him from here
was a Miss Treadwell. Ground floor
flat.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.400
She saw him heading out
about seven last night.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.080
There's some talk
that he might have been at Beaufort.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.400
And he was behind with the rent.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.840
- What?
- Your idea of "not much".

07:52.880 --> 07:55.880
- Have I missed something?
- No, no. It is commendably thorough.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.440
I don't suppose anyone knew if he
was a night owl or an early riser?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.640
I can ask. Why? Is it important?

08:03.680 --> 08:05.720
Wondered what he had to get up for
so early.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.840
The clock was stopped dead on five.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.120
Not a few minutes to nor a few
minutes past, but bang on the hour.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.200
- Too neat, you mean?
- What's this?

08:14.240 --> 08:18.280
Morse has some reservations
about this death by fire.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.520
What's new?

08:20.560 --> 08:22.800
No, go on. Who was he?

08:22.840 --> 08:25.120
Simon Hallward. Read Philosophy at
Beaufort,

08:25.160 --> 08:26.920
only he dropped out last summer.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.640
Joined a commune up by Boar's Hill
run by a man called Gideon Finn.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.440
- Calls himself Brother Gideon.
- Morse.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.559
Sergeant Strange said I might find
you here.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.679
Trewlove. This is Detective
Inspector Thursday and DS Jakes.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.039
- Constable.
- Wotcher.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.280
I went by the Turf
to ask after your man Hallward.

08:44.320 --> 08:47.520
He was in there last night shortly
after seven,
on his usual Radfords,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.840
when he added a gin and bitter lemon
to his order.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.480
- So he had a woman with him.
- That was my thought.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.720
No description though. He was sat
around the corner from the bar.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.120
I just... thought you'd want to know.

08:58.160 --> 09:02.360
- Excellent use of initiative, Constable.
- Thank you, sir.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.800
Morse. Sergeant.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.200
You sickening for something?

09:09.240 --> 09:13.960
New WPC and no off-colour remarks?
We'll be sending out for iron
tablets.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.200
I've been through his post. It's odd.

09:23.240 --> 09:26.360
A man dies but the business of his
life goes on.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.360
Letter from his parents.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.760
Notice of an AGM for the Oxford
Trogs, whatever that might be.

09:32.800 --> 09:37.040
Bills mainly. Art supplier, wine
merchant. Final demand on both.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.560
- The door was locked, then?
- Yes, according to Strange.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.200
- Brigade had to chop their way in.
- So where's the key?

09:45.960 --> 09:48.640
This Finn character. Where did you
say he was?

10:13.840 --> 10:15.360
Good afternoon.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.360
Come in peace and friendship.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.400
Enter freely with a loving heart,

10:23.440 --> 10:26.200
and leave behind some of the
happiness you bring.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.400
No, you're all right, miss,
thank you.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.480
DI Thursday, DC Morse. City Police.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.120
Miss...? Ayesha.

10:33.160 --> 10:36.040
- We're looking for Gideon Finn.
- I'm Gideon.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.120
Welcome to House Beautiful.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.960
- That's awful. Poor Simon.
- When did you last see him?

10:44.840 --> 10:49.640
It must be six months. He left us
last autumn, after the harvest.

10:49.680 --> 10:53.800
- How was it you knew him?
- We met in Life Drawing class.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.640
That was his thing, really. Art,
painting.

10:56.680 --> 11:00.960
That's Simon's. Oxford was his
parents' idea. But we stayed in
touch.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.080
After he threw in his degree, he came
out here.

11:03.120 --> 11:07.800
- Why did he leave? A falling out?
- No, nothing like that.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.800
He just, um... moved on.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.760
I don't think he got what we're
about.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.480
- What are you about?
- A simpler way.

11:18.600 --> 11:22.560
We have questions about ourselves,
and the world,

11:22.600 --> 11:26.600
erm, what we're here for, what it
means.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.160
And you're the leader of this, er...
whatever you want to call it.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.760
It's a commune.

11:33.800 --> 11:38.400
We have no leaders, but I found the
place, started the work.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.000
- Do you want one?
- No. No, thanks.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.760
- Big place. Who owns it?
- Nobody.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.240
- It must belong to someone.
- All property is theft.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.680
- Is that right, miss?
- We're not harming anyone.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.200
We eat what we grow.
We drink what we draw from the well.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.920
- Sounds like hard work.
- It is.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.080
But at least we're not harming each
other.

12:00.120 --> 12:04.040
- Simon Hallward wasn't happy with that.
- He wasn't ready.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.840
- For what?
- To let go.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.160
To trust.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.640
He was still too attached to the
world.

12:09.680 --> 12:15.240
You see them, crowded onto trains,
hurtling through life, just another
rat in the race.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.640
And for what? First to the grave?

12:19.320 --> 12:20.960
That's not what we're about.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.880
Consider the lilies of the field.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.240
"Consider the lilies of the field"?

12:34.280 --> 12:38.200
Come that old madam with me,
and he'll be considering my boot up
his arse.

12:38.240 --> 12:41.400
- You won't be signing up, then?
- There's nothing wrong with that one

12:41.440 --> 12:45.240
that two weeks in the glasshouse and
a scrub down with carbolic wouldn't
put right.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.840
Did you see the girl flinch
when he put his hands on her?

12:47.880 --> 12:51.440
Yes, I saw.
Pot and free love, I suppose.

12:52.080 --> 12:56.440
Free love. In my experience, that's
the most expensive kind there is.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.000
ALL: End the illegal regime!
End the illegal regime!

13:02.720 --> 13:05.680
End the illegal regime!
End the illegal regime!

13:06.080 --> 13:08.240
End the illegal regime!
End the illegal regime!

13:08.280 --> 13:10.480
PROTESTER: Freedom for Rhodesia!

13:11.480 --> 13:16.320
End the illegal regime! End the illegal regime!

13:18.920 --> 13:21.920
- Freedom for Rhodesia!
- ALL: End the illegal regime!

13:21.960 --> 13:23.800
Simon Hallward.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.600
Asphyxia.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.360
He'd drunk, quite heavily.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.400
Which is probably why he didn't wake
when the fire broke out.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.320
He was in the pub most nights,
according to the neighbours.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.840
The Last of the Red Hot Livers.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.680
Hm. Now...

13:40.160 --> 13:46.280
...if you'll excuse me, I've a little
mystery of my own to solve.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.040
Miss Lorraine Figgis.

13:48.080 --> 13:52.120
Fit young woman, just collapsed in
the street on the way back from the
shops.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.400
Upstairs are at a loss.

13:54.440 --> 13:59.760
They thought it might have been this
stomach bug, but if it was it would
be the first fatality.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.400
- So...
- These hers or yours?

14:02.440 --> 14:04.160
Oh, hers.

14:04.200 --> 14:08.760
Came to hospital with her. Though
what they expect me to do with them.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.840
- Aw. How old is she?
- 14 months.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.200
Aw! She's gorgeous.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.280
Come on, you. Let's get you home.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.680
- All right?
- PROTESTORS: End the illegal regime!

14:26.720 --> 14:31.280
End the illegal regime! End the illegal regime!
End the illegal regime!

15:02.320 --> 15:05.520
Here comes the train,
into the tunnel.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.920
- Glass? In baby food?
- Mm, stewed apples to be precise.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.520
- It's a miracle the child wasn't badly injured.
- Or worse.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.560
- Where did the mother come by it?
- Richardsons, in the centre.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.480
Mrs Thursday swears by them for
value.

15:18.520 --> 15:21.200
One of about two dozen stores,
here and in the Midlands.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.920
- Have they been spoken to?
- Morse is on his way there now

15:23.960 --> 15:26.440
to talk to the manager,
a Mr Maddox, see what's what.

15:26.480 --> 15:29.520
We had Mr Richardson, the owner,
in the station the other night.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.680
He'd been drinking quite heavily,
but there's something else.

15:32.720 --> 15:37.200
A young woman collapsed and died in
the street after shopping at
Richardsons on Saturday.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.320
Now the hospital had this down as

15:39.360 --> 15:41.520
some kind of tummy bug at first.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.680
- Coincidence, surely?
- Possibly.

15:43.720 --> 15:48.760
But two incidents where both of the
customers have come to harm,
it could be something more.

15:48.800 --> 15:52.760
We're taking the baby food off the
shelves in case there's glass in any
of the others.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.280
But she's sure she got it from here,
is she?

15:55.320 --> 15:58.680
Much as I like to flatter myself,
customers do shop elsewhere.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.440
It was Richardsons' own brand.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.880
I can show you the receipt, if you'd
like to see it.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.200
Luckily the little girl was off her
food.

16:05.240 --> 16:08.360
Her mother thought she might try some
if she saw her eat first.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.360
There must be some sort of
malfunction at the bottling plant.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.160
I'll talk to our suppliers.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.760
I'll talk to your suppliers
if you give me their number.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.000
Of course.
Unless there was anything else?

16:23.320 --> 16:25.120
Actually, there is another matter.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.320
One of your customers collapsed on
the street yesterday afternoon.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.960
Possibly this stomach bug.
Sadly, she died in the night.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.920
You're not laying that at our door, I
hope.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.800
No. But when going through her
effects,

16:34.840 --> 16:38.200
she had a substantial amount of
Green Shield Stamps in her bag.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.320
They're proving very popular.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.040
I'm no expert, but she seemed to have

16:42.080 --> 16:44.920
many more stamps
than her purchases seemed to warrant.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.920
All done, Dad. Where do you want
them? Out back, please.

PROTESTORS: - End the illegal regime!

16:55.560 --> 16:59.280
- What's this?
- (SIGHS) Rhodesia. The boycott.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.760
They've got it into their heads
we're selling embargoed sugar.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.480
- Are you?
- The law is very clear.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.839
We would not and, as far as we're
aware,

17:07.880 --> 17:10.079
have not bought Rhodesian sugar.

17:10.119 --> 17:12.920
Such goods could be bought via
indirect means.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.680
This company was founded
on good Christian principles.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.839
Quakers, weren't they, the
Richardsons?

17:17.880 --> 17:19.640
Well...

17:21.680 --> 17:24.960
- Good heavens. What's this?
- I believe it's called a sit-in.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.160
I'm suspected of what?

17:27.200 --> 17:30.680
We were exercising our lawful right
to peaceful protest.

17:30.720 --> 17:34.080
This morning a young mother bought
a jar of baby food from Richardsons.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.640
It was laced with broken glass.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.920
She came this close to feeding it to
her child.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.920
That is... barbaric.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.840
But you cannot imagine
it was anything to do with us.

17:46.880 --> 17:50.120
People have done far worse
in the name of one thing or another.

17:50.160 --> 17:54.920
- It was a non-violent demonstration.
- Actually, it was trespass.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.440
If you're convicted
you could have your visa revoked.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.360
I can't see how that would help you.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.080
If I am sent back to my country,

18:01.120 --> 18:03.360
I will most likely be killed.

matter any further... this time.

take a look once I've dropped you at
the station.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.040
- Heh-hey!
- Richardsons were out of your usual,

20:50.080 --> 20:53.680
so it'll have to be bloater paste.
- Oh! Right. Nice change.

it in for your business.

had been provisioning the army

at odds with his pacifist credo.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.040
Whoever it is will be gone by now.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.480
And as you're here...

33:32.720 --> 33:35.560
This zip really is a devil.

33:38.600 --> 33:42.080
I'm sure I'm not the first woman
you've seen in her underclothes.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.360
(THEY CHUCKLE)

34:16.880 --> 34:18.520
Thank you.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.360
I'll be downstairs.

34:25.120 --> 34:28.120
Do you not like women? Is that it?

34:30.560 --> 34:36.880
I'm not... asking you to run
away with me... to the Kasbah.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.840
What would be the harm?

34:45.320 --> 34:48.360
I'm... afraid it's a little too...

34:50.560 --> 34:53.679
...sophisticated... for me.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.240
Well, when... when you change your
mind...

35:07.120 --> 35:09.120
...you have my number.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.320
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

35:28.320 --> 35:30.080
Hello again.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.880
Your mother thought that there was
an intruder. It was a false alarm.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.080
Dad told me what's going on.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.520
Who'd want to do this?

35:38.560 --> 35:40.480
My parents...

35:40.520 --> 35:43.920
- They're not bad people.
- They're successful, rich,

35:43.960 --> 35:47.240
which makes them a target
for some very bad people indeed.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.720
Try not to worry.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.080
- Good night.
- Good night.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.480
An intruder.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.120
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)
I thought so.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.080
Where's Daddy?

36:04.120 --> 36:06.560
Out. I don't know.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.320
- How was your date?
- It wasn't a date.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.000
No, of course not.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.960
You wouldn't let a boy touch you
where he shouldn't, would you?

36:16.440 --> 36:18.280
What do you want?

36:20.720 --> 36:22.440
A drink.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.120
Verity?

36:53.280 --> 36:54.680
Verity?

36:55.120 --> 36:57.000
Verity.

37:00.360 --> 37:01.520
Verity?

37:01.560 --> 37:02.960
Leo!

37:04.320 --> 37:06.160
- Leo!
- Where are you?

37:06.200 --> 37:08.520
Leo, come quick!

37:08.560 --> 37:10.200
What is it?

37:19.320 --> 37:20.960
Let's spread out.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.760
- Victor, you come with me.
- Sir.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.640
Sergeant!

37:35.480 --> 37:37.640
- Blood?
- Oh, yes.

37:37.680 --> 37:43.040
Same on the bed, and the stairs.
There's not much more I can tell you.

37:43.080 --> 37:45.760
- What about these?
- Librium.

37:45.800 --> 37:49.560
Tranquillisers. Usually prescribed
for anxiety.

37:49.600 --> 37:53.680
Dr Amthor. Doesn't ring a bell, I'm
afraid.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.640
You know where I am if you need me.

37:55.680 --> 37:56.920
Doctor.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.840
- Who saw her last?
- Her mother. About half-past ten.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.600
- Nobody heard anything?
- No.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.680
I saw Mrs Richardson here last night.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.720
She'd been drinking quite heavily.

38:07.760 --> 38:10.720
- What were you doing here?
- She called the station.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.960
She thought there'd been an
intruder, but there wasn't.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.360
Then she claimed to have seen
someone in the garden.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.120
- Claimed?
- There was no-one there,
so far as I could see.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.440
- Where was the father?
- Out.

38:21.480 --> 38:24.640
He says he got in about one,
fell asleep on the sofa downstairs.

38:24.680 --> 38:27.920
Found this, sir.
Caught on a branch in the garden.

38:27.960 --> 38:31.520
Now, there was a dentist's surgery
in Summertown turned over yesterday.

38:31.560 --> 38:35.360
WPC Trewlove says there was
a bottle of chloroform with the
takings.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.240
When the call comes, and it will,
it's very important you stay calm.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.440
Keep him talking for as long as you
can.

38:46.480 --> 38:50.800
The longer you can keep him talking,
the better chance we've got of
tracing the call. All right?

38:50.840 --> 38:54.040
- It's the supermarket Richardsons?
- Yes, sir.

38:54.080 --> 38:57.440
- Kidnap, presumably.
- That's what we're assuming.

38:57.480 --> 39:00.880
No ransom demand as yet. Entry seems
to have been the back door.

39:00.920 --> 39:04.080
Whoever took her
knew exactly where to find her.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.040
- What do we know about the girl?
- Oh, not a great deal.

39:07.080 --> 39:10.440
Attended Blythe Mount.
Finishing school on the Continent.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.200
Involved with AmnOx.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.840
- The civil rights people.
- That's them, sir.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.160
The Howard League. Good causes in
general.

39:17.200 --> 39:21.720
Verity had been prescribed
tranquillisers, Mrs Richardson.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.560
Yes, she... she suffers with her
nerves.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.600
Whoever took her
knew which room was your daughter's.

39:30.640 --> 39:32.960
We'll need a list of her friends and
of yours.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
But this is... whoever is threatening
the business.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.920
Mr and Mrs Richardson.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.840
Chief Superintendent Reginald Bright,
City Police.

39:40.880 --> 39:44.400
I'm here at the express wish
of the Chief Constable

39:44.440 --> 39:47.000
to assure you we will do everything
possible

39:47.040 --> 39:49.800
to see your daughter home again safe
and sound.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.960
Leo? Annette?

39:56.120 --> 39:58.880
- What's going on?
- It's Verity.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.560
Some... someone's taken her in the
night.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.000
What? My God.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.840
- What are you doing here?
- I...

40:07.320 --> 40:10.800
I just went into the store to see if
there was anything I could do and...

40:12.240 --> 40:16.240
...I found this in the bread aisle.
I don't how long it's been there.

40:16.280 --> 40:19.360
I thought it might have something to
do with the other business.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.600
"Stay by your phone. Wait for
instruction.

alive again, you'll put £100,000

in used, unmarked notes of small
denomination into a dark holdall.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.400
Come to the phone box
on Merton Street at 4am.

41:06.440 --> 41:08.440
Come alone and on foot.

41:08.480 --> 41:11.320
If I see the police, the deal's off,
the girl's dead.

41:12.360 --> 41:15.800
How do I know you'll do as you say?
How do I know she's even alive?

41:15.840 --> 41:18.160
- VERITY: Daddy! No!
- ANNETTE: Give it to me!

41:19.160 --> 41:20.960

her!

MAN: You're a businessman, think of
this as a business transaction.

41:24.560 --> 41:29.000
If you follow my instructions,
you'll see her again. If you don't,
she dies.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.920
Talk to the police, she dies.

41:31.960 --> 41:35.880
Speak to the press, she dies.

Oh, my God.

Sir?

42:01.440 --> 42:03.840
This ransom drop.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.240
I'd like to volunteer.

42:06.280 --> 42:10.040
- It was Jakes I had in mind.
- There's no saying how it might go.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.640
- Dangerous, you mean?
- Potentially.

42:14.760 --> 42:17.400
Job for a single man, I'd have
thought.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.000

- He told me his news.
- Mm.

42:26.360 --> 42:29.080
- You knew, then?
- He mentioned something.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.480
- You didn't say.
- For him to tell you.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.840
- Sudden.
- The way it goes sometimes.

42:52.240 --> 42:54.280
Wouldn't have had you for a sweet
tooth.

42:55.160 --> 42:58.760
- What is it? Calm the nerves?
- Something like that.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.720
Just follow whatever instructions he
gives you. All right?

43:01.760 --> 43:04.040
Don't try anything clever.

- It's a girl's life we're talking about.
- I know.

43:07.320 --> 43:10.400
All right. (EXHALES)

43:23.160 --> 43:24.880
It should have been me.
I'm her father.

Clean away with the money,
and us none the wiser as to the girl.

46:59.420 --> 47:02.900
- It was a good plan.
- Nothing's foolproof.

47:05.180 --> 47:07.380
He's got us beat. So far.

47:07.420 --> 47:09.980
- How's the head?
- Oh, nothing broken, thank you.

47:10.020 --> 47:13.500
He's got what he wanted. Let's see
if he keeps his side of the bargain.

47:13.540 --> 47:16.220
- I wouldn't hold your breath.
- We need a dog team.

47:16.660 --> 47:18.780
I know you said not to try anything,

47:18.820 --> 47:21.660
but erm... those sweets?
Aniseed balls.

47:21.700 --> 47:23.700
I put one in each corner of the

chance.

We'll go this way.

47:52.300 --> 47:53.980
- Down there.
- Sir.

47:54.020 --> 47:55.660
- Lads, up there.
- Yes, sir.

48:10.620 --> 48:12.900
- Do you think we'll find her?
- We'll find her.

48:12.940 --> 48:14.620
Alive?

48:18.260 --> 48:20.260
Be nice to go out on a win.

riding the range, or whatever it is
you do with beeves.

- Maybe.

- Hell's this?
- It's chalk works. Flint works too.

48:49.100 --> 48:51.500
Used when the Botley Road
was re-laid before the war.

48:51.540 --> 48:54.780
Simon Hallward was a member of the
Oxford Trogs. Spelunkers. Cavers.

48:54.820 --> 48:57.900
- There was some kit at his lock-up.
- But Hallward's dead.

48:57.940 --> 49:00.020
Yeah, but what if he's not?

49:00.060 --> 49:04.060
What if he started the fire and it
was someone else's body that we
found at his flat?

49:04.100 --> 49:07.580
Dental records. The only way that we
can identify him. What are the odds

49:07.620 --> 49:10.900
it's not just chloroform been taken
from that dentist's surgery?

nor by here since God knows when.

52:05.300 --> 52:06.980
Careful. Careful.

52:09.540 --> 52:12.060
Come on, get her out. I'm right
behind you.

52:20.100 --> 52:21.900
This way.

52:22.860 --> 52:24.740
(TICKING)

52:26.420 --> 52:28.780
Just up here. Through there.

52:29.740 --> 52:32.260
(EXPLOSION)

52:35.060 --> 52:37.260
(COUGHS)

52:39.020 --> 52:42.300
Peter? Peter?

52:47.060 --> 52:48.500
(COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING)

52:52.700 --> 52:54.700
What was that about second thoughts?

53:05.140 --> 53:08.420
- How is she, nurse?
- As well as can be expected.

53:08.460 --> 53:12.020
Tired. She'd had nothing to eat or
drink since she was taken,

53:12.060 --> 53:13.620
but she's otherwise unharmed.

53:13.660 --> 53:16.540
I suppose we should be grateful it
was nothing more.

53:16.580 --> 53:19.580
- There was nothing more?
- She says not.

53:19.620 --> 53:21.020
Does she remember anything?

53:22.580 --> 53:25.140
The last thing I remember
is going to bed.

53:25.180 --> 53:28.660
I think I maybe half woke up,
but only for a second.

53:30.100 --> 53:33.900
I had the briefest sensation of
something over my nose and mouth.

53:35.060 --> 53:36.900
It smelled like...

53:36.940 --> 53:41.500
I had a tooth out when I was about
14. It was the same smell.

53:42.740 --> 53:44.740
Next thing, I woke up.

53:46.660 --> 53:49.020
I thought for a moment that I'd gone
blind.

53:50.020 --> 53:52.540
But then I realised
I had some sort of blindfold on.

53:52.580 --> 53:55.820
And you never saw his face at any
time? Never heard his voice?

53:55.860 --> 53:57.340
VERITY: No.

53:58.660 --> 54:01.100
I thought I was going to die.

54:04.180 --> 54:08.500
- All right, miss.
We'll let you get some rest.
- Thank you.

54:08.540 --> 54:11.500
Pru, dear. That was Leo. They've
found her.

54:12.580 --> 54:14.420
Thank God.

54:14.460 --> 54:17.740
- And the kidnapper?
- No. No word.

54:17.780 --> 54:20.860
I don't suppose Leo's worried about
the money.

54:20.900 --> 54:25.740
- The main thing is they got her back.
- Yes.
- That's the main thing.

54:26.620 --> 54:29.260
Well, I've got to go in.

54:29.300 --> 54:33.900
The re-stock's almost done
and Leo wants to open up.

54:33.940 --> 54:37.900
Business as usual? How can you stand
it?

54:39.060 --> 54:41.020
Well, someone has to.

55:29.780 --> 55:34.700
Is there any news?
It's just... we're very fond of her.

55:36.140 --> 55:37.380
- Yes.
- Miss Flett?

55:37.420 --> 55:40.780
You bastard! Arrest him! He knew
there was something in the food

55:40.820 --> 55:42.780
and he kept quiet about it!
- All right!

55:49.460 --> 55:51.780
You're going to have to hold the
fort on the kidnap.

55:51.820 --> 55:55.460
I'm going back to the station to
brief Mr Bright before he reports to
Division.

55:55.500 --> 55:57.740
Talk to Suzy Flett, one of the women
on the tills.

55:57.780 --> 56:01.460
Turns out Miss Figgis, the poisoning
victim, was her cousin. Right?

56:04.740 --> 56:06.900
So tell me about these Green Shield
Stamps.

56:06.940 --> 56:11.220
You were giving Miss Figgis far more
than she was entitled to. Isn't that
correct? Weekly?

56:11.260 --> 56:13.500
It was just a bit of pin money.

56:13.540 --> 56:16.980
We'd just... redeem 'em
to get the odd gift from the shop.

56:17.020 --> 56:19.380
And what would you do with the gifts?
Sell them on?

56:19.420 --> 56:22.580
No-one's ever gonna get rich
on the wages they pay here.

56:22.620 --> 56:26.020
Compared to what they've been doing,
letting people get poisoned...

56:26.060 --> 56:28.340
Let us worry about that.

56:33.380 --> 56:36.180
I'd keep Miss Flett away from the
tills if I were you.

56:36.220 --> 56:39.780
Yes. Well, we don't want her
upsetting customers.

56:39.820 --> 56:41.900
I think that's the least of your
problems.

56:41.940 --> 56:46.900
It must be hard seeing the company
name dragged through the dirt.

56:46.940 --> 56:50.740
Maddox and Richardson.
Bit before my time, of course.

56:50.780 --> 56:53.700
Nonetheless, dissolving any
partnership is difficult,

56:53.740 --> 56:57.260
especially when one seems
to have involved such acrimony.

56:57.300 --> 57:01.260
Are you sure there's no residual
ill feeling between you
and Leo Richardson?

57:01.300 --> 57:03.900
I wouldn't be working for him if
there were.

57:03.940 --> 57:09.860
Look, I've seen what resentment can
do, Constable. First hand.

57:09.900 --> 57:13.180
My father, my grandfather both.

57:13.220 --> 57:15.140
Bitterness. Regret.

57:15.180 --> 57:17.860
It ate them from the inside out.

57:17.900 --> 57:19.820
Both dead by 40.

57:20.940 --> 57:22.260
No.

57:22.300 --> 57:27.100
Middle-management, middle of the
batting order, middle of the road.

57:28.380 --> 57:30.380
There's a lot to be said for it.

57:35.540 --> 57:36.860
ANNETTE: It's your fault.

57:39.300 --> 57:41.100
My fault.

57:43.140 --> 57:45.980
How exactly is it my fault?

57:46.020 --> 57:47.780
The business.

57:47.820 --> 57:49.740
Someone you've...

57:51.300 --> 57:52.940
...done down or...

57:57.220 --> 58:00.980
- She could have died.
- Christ, you think I don't know that?

58:04.500 --> 58:07.100
She's the one good thing
we ever did.

58:09.220 --> 58:13.700
It's a judgment, Leo. God sees all.

58:15.580 --> 58:18.460
It's a bit late to start bringing
him into it.

58:42.490 --> 58:46.010
You think this is how whoever it is
did for Hallward?

58:46.050 --> 58:47.970
If it was Hallward's body at all.

58:48.010 --> 58:51.330
Yes, what is this new theory of
yours, Morse? Hallward's alive?

58:51.370 --> 58:54.090
Well, Hallward seemed to have a hand
in all of it so far, sir.

58:54.130 --> 58:57.330
The poisoning, the broken glass
and Verity Richardson's kidnap.

58:57.370 --> 59:01.250
The kidnapper had a Norfolk accent
and Hallward's family were from
Norfolk.

59:01.290 --> 59:05.010
- Rather elaborate.
- Not if we were meant to
take it at face value, sir.

59:05.050 --> 59:06.730
Ingenious, really.

59:06.770 --> 59:09.090
A sort of homemade time bomb.
With the door locked,

59:09.130 --> 59:11.250
Hallward didn't stand a cat in
hell's chance.

59:11.290 --> 59:12.650
- If it works.
- It'll work.

59:12.690 --> 59:15.370
Any second... now.

59:34.250 --> 59:35.370
(Beep)

59:37.410 --> 59:40.130
- Is that it?
- A watched pot.

59:40.170 --> 59:41.770
Bad luck.

59:41.810 --> 59:44.930
Sorry, sir.
A message from Dr DeBryn.

59:44.970 --> 59:47.650
Hallward's dental records have been
located

59:47.690 --> 59:51.090
and match those of the cadaver
recovered from the fire.

59:51.130 --> 59:54.890
If it wasn't Hallward, who was it on
the phone?

59:54.930 --> 59:57.850
And whom do we have here?

59:57.890 --> 01:00:00.490
WPC 734 Trewlove, sir.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.290
One of the replacement intakes, sir.
Started last week.

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:06.690
- Your first posting, is it?
- Yes, sir.

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:10.970
Excellent. Well, we run a taut ship
here at Cowley,

01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:13.810
though I like to think a happy one
also.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:15.690
All work and...

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:18.050
- Wouldn't you say so, Thursday?
- Sir?

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:21.770
- The ship. A happy one.
- Oh, as the day is long, sir.

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:23.930
My door is always... well,

01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:27.570
if not actually open then not
infrequently ajar. - Thank you, sir.

01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:30.650
Well, er... carry on.

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:36.130
It was a nice idea.

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:39.010
Hallward was behind the poisoning,

01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:41.810
the evidence in his studio puts it
beyond any doubt.

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:46.010
- He can't kidnap Verity
Richardson if he's dead.
- He can't, no.

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:49.930
But what if he had confided in
someone or had a partner maybe?

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:54.410
And they thought that all the ransom
sounded better than half. But who?

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:56.490
Someone who was close to the family,

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:58.890
someone who knew the layout of the
house.

01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:02.410
The night she was taken,
you'd been on a date together.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:07.090
No, it wasn't a date. We just went
for a drink in town, catch-up.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:12.490
Look, I've known her since we were
kids. We're like cousins.
Brother and sister almost.

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:15.410
How did she seem? Nothing worrying
her that she talked about?

01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:17.610
No.

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:21.050
- How were things at home?
- Good, so far as I know.

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:22.850
I've been away at college in America

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:25.010
and she's very wrapped up in her
AmnOx work.

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:30.250
You're better off talking to my mum.
She saw far more of Verity than me
these past few years.

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:34.090
- How's that?
- They both go to the Friends House in town.

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:04.730
(MURMURED CONVERSATION)

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:16.370
Mrs Maddox? Detective Constable
Morse, City Police.

01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:19.370
You should have waited outside.

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:21.890
Well, the sign says "All are
welcome".

01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:24.330
All are welcome. To worship.

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:26.970
It's not my first time in a meeting
house, Mrs Maddox.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:30.050
I know what is and isn't welcome.
I was raised in Quakerism.

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.170
So far as my father would allow.

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:36.730
I wanted to ask you a few questions
about the Richardsons.

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.290
A happy family, would you say?

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.930
No more or less than any other.

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:45.970
Leo makes money, Annette spends it.

01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:47.850
It seems enough.

01:02:49.450 --> 01:02:51.450
What about Verity?

01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:58.730
I'm very fond of Verity.

01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:03.010
She used to come to meetings a lot
when she was younger.

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:06.970
Since this last year,
I think she's been once or twice.

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:10.530
I suppose she has less time now
with her work for AmnOx.

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:14.010
She ever mention anything at home?
Or boyfriend trouble?

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:19.170
She'd had a bad experience, I think.

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:22.890
End of last year, about a month or
two after she got back.

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:27.010
A man. I mean, I assumed it was a
man.

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:29.170
It usually is at that age.

01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:32.170
Your son seems fond of her. Verity.

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:34.330
It's not a trick question, Mrs
Maddox.

01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:36.490
It's about Leo, isn't it?

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:39.450
It's someone he's rubbed up the
wrong way,

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:42.050
or a disgruntled member of staff.

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:46.610
Maybe someone who knows he's got a
bit of money. Wouldn't you think?

01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:55.450
- When did you last come to a meeting?
- Oh, not since I was a boy.

01:03:56.970 --> 01:04:01.210
I was never much of a believer then.
Even less now.

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:06.890
I could have baulked at it.

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:11.170
Refused point blank to go. Kicked up
a fuss.

01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:13.210
Why didn't you?

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:20.250
Because I didn't want to disappoint
her.
She'd had enough of that.

01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:28.290
So we'd go, the two of us, and sit in
silence.

01:04:31.090 --> 01:04:34.090
Sometimes the spirit would move her
and she'd speak.

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:36.090
"Minister", we call it.

01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:41.650
But mostly it was silence.
"Still your mind," she'd say.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:44.250
That was the point.

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:47.810
"Still your mind."

01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:55.210
Never got the knack.

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:05.770
(PHONE RINGS)

01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:08.770
Good morning. AmnOx.
How can I help you?

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:15.450
- Volunteering?
- No.

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:18.330
Then might I trouble you for a
donation? All in a good cause.

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:19.690
I know, I'm a donor.

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:22.010
Detective Constable Morse,
City Police.

01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:27.490
- Guilty conscience?
- How's that?

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:29.530
A policeman donating to AmnOx?

01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:32.730
Your lot are usually more at home
arresting lawful protestors.

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:36.250
You should be safe today. My rubber
truncheon's at the menders.

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:39.970
What can I do for you?

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:43.730
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about Verity Richardson, Miss...?

01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:46.570
Brooke. Marion Brooke. Just Marion,
if you like.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.250
What sort of questions?

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:49.490
General.

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:52.650
I understand she's quite involved
with all this.

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.650
She volunteers here, yes.

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:59.730
Look, I was just about to take my
lunch. It'll be easier for us to talk
off the premises.

01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:06.810
She'd been abroad for AmnOx
last year?

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:09.810
To Rhodesia, as part of a
fact-finding mission

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:12.570
and to help support the families
of political prisoners,

01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:17.290
those unjustly accused of insurgency
- sabotage, blowing up railway lines.

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:20.570
She'd been under a private doctor,
I understand, for her nerves.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:23.530
Oh, really? Well, I don't know about
that.

01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:26.410
I mean, she was quite poorly
when she got back from Africa.

01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:28.770
Some nasty she'd picked up out there.

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:32.010
She was off work for a while
and I know that left her quite low.

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:35.170
Did she ever mention a Simon
Hallward?

01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:39.810
The only Simon I ever heard her
mention was that chap who painted her
picture.

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:42.010
A portrait her family wanted done.

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.850
He seems an unlikely portraitist.

01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:50.850
His work seems to have been
avant-garde in the main.

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:52.850
Abstracts and so forth.

01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:56.650
- Where did you find him?
- Through Verity, I think.

01:06:56.690 --> 01:07:00.810
- But you met him?
- Mm. He was very handsome.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:04.010
Had a great sense of... fun.

01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:07.410
Yes, his chief source of amusement
of late

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:10.850
was running an extortion campaign
against your husband's business.

01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:12.530
Were you sleeping with him?

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:18.650
You do that again and we can add
assault to the list of charges your
family is going to face.

What time did you get to the
Maddox's party?

01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.610
Fashionably late?

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:26.650
Time enough to stop
for a gin and bitter lemon

01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:28.370
with Simon Hallward at the Turf?

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:31.090
How many people in Oxford
like gin and bitter lemon?

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:34.330
Thousands probably. But of the
people I've met on this case, only
one.

01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:40.930

Getting married.

Yeah. It looks that way.

Oh, well, there's a turn-up.

01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:56.790
- What's she like, his fiancee?
- I don't know. I haven't met her.

01:08:56.830 --> 01:08:58.750
I only found out myself this week.

01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:01.550

thought?

The voice on the tape was exactly
that. A recording of Hallward.

The kidnapper assumed it would be
Mr Richardson on the phone.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:36.430
But at one point, Mrs Richardson
picks up the receiver and says...

- VERITY: No!
- ANNETTE: Give it to me.

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:41.390

- He thinks he's talking to Mrs Richardson.

01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:52.270
- So why would he say, "businessman"?
- Could be a slip of the tongue.

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:55.030
It could, but when he gives
instructions for the drop

01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:21.270
Hi.

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:23.350
Hello.

01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:27.190
How you feeling?

01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:30.070
I've been better.

01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:34.990
Erm... Mum and Dad send their best.

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:43.230
- I was so scared.
- Of course you were.

01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:47.510
It's OK, you're safe now.
They'll catch him. Don't worry.

01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:51.710
Anything from the commune?

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:54.510
Couple of them have been done
for possession of marijuana.

01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:57.470
This Ayesha girl's real name
is Thelma Anne Davis.

01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:00.430
- I'm having her previous wired through.
- And Gideon Finn?

01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:04.590
Before he set up in the
"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam"
business, he gave art lessons

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:07.910
to the sons and daughters of the well-to-do.
- Does he have a record?

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:11.550
Not as such, sir. But his name does
come up as a victim of assault.

01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:15.110
Father of one of Finn's pupils, a
15-year-old girl,

01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:18.270
got it into his head that there was
a bit more on the curriculum

01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:20.270
than perspective and the colour
wheel.

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:22.910
- Did Finn bring charges
against the father?
- No.

01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:25.670
So there must've been something in
it. Wouldn't you think?

01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:32.310
- Here.
- Oh.

01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:33.870
- Thanks.
- How is she?

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:36.110
All right, I think.

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:39.910
Quite a few visitors this afternoon.
I've got a list.

01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:44.870
Mike Maddox came by and a pal
of hers from AmnOx. Marion Brooke.

01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:48.750
By the way, your Teasmade.

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:51.430
- You were right.
- I was?

01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:55.150
The only reason you didn't have any
success in the yard is because it's
outside.

01:12:55.190 --> 01:12:57.230
The vapours dispersed.

01:12:57.270 --> 01:13:00.270
In Hallward's flat it would have
built up, filled the room.

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:05.150
As the liquid boiled away, the
exposed element would have become
white hot and, well...

01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:06.910
- Boom.
- Quite.

01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:11.670
Well done.

01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:16.550
Hello.

01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:51.310
Does Cuthbert Mukamba volunteer here?

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:54.270
He does, when he can. But today's
not one of his days, I'm afraid.

01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:56.310
What did you want to speak to him
about?

01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:59.910
Did you take a "get well soon" card
from him to Verity Richardson?

01:13:59.950 --> 01:14:02.070
There's no law against that, is
there?

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:03.470
No.

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:06.910
- Who's Dziva?
- Why do you ask?

01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:11.710
You mean Dzivaguru.
Chthonic goddess.

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:14.270
The Great Creatrix
of the Shona people.

01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:17.750
Stands for life, fertility. But
woe betide anyone that crosses her.

01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:19.950
- How's that?
- She has bit of a temper.

01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:22.030
Goddess of the Night, too.

01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:25.870
Of course, to we Catholics,
that's just superstition.

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:30.670
So why would Cuthbert Mukamba
address Verity Richardson as Dziva?

01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:36.790
Miss Richardson
came to my country last year

01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:38.990
with a delegation from AmnOx.

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:42.270
My brother is a political prisoner in
Salisbury.

01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:44.670
AmnOx supported his family
with money

01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:47.230
and organising legal representation.

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:49.270
You were friends, then.

01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:51.990
We were.

01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:55.030
I wonder then why, of all the "get
well soon" cards she received,

01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:58.630
yours was the only one that she tore
up and put in the wastepaper basket.

01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:02.470
I also wonder why you addressed her
as Dziva, Goddess.

01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:06.910
In this country, that's a term of
endearment usually reserved for more
than friends.

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:14.190
- What is there to say?
- The truth.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:22.390
- So you put pressure on her?
- Well, what were we meant to do?

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:24.270
- Support her?
- It's easy for you to say.

01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:28.510
What if it was your daughter? We were
thinking of her future. Her good
name. Her reputation.

01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:31.070
The only good name you were thinking
of was Richardsons.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.830
- We did the right thing.
- For who?

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:34.790
She was 19. We are still her parents.

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:36.950
What chance would she have
of a decent husband

01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:38.830
with a Marxist bastard hanging
around?

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:41.870
- It was his politics you disapproved of?
- We did nothing wrong.

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:45.230
I'm not concerned with ethics,
morals. The law's my business

01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:47.270
and procuring an abortion is illegal.

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:51.990
Not if the patient's mental state is
at risk.

01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:55.110
I suppose that's where Dr Amthor
comes in.

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:57.710
For the right money, he signs an
affidavit

01:15:57.750 --> 01:16:00.110
to the effect that she's likely to do
herself harm,

01:16:00.150 --> 01:16:02.310
and no-one can touch you. Health
farm, was it?

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:07.350
This isn't the end of it, I promise
you.

01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:18.710
I really was thinking of Verity.

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:25.790
I could have been... something more.

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:31.110
But you meet someone.

01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:35.470
The wedding dress
becomes the christening gown,

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:37.830
and before you know where you are
it's 20 years.

01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:43.750
You wonder if those bright summer
mornings ever happened at all.

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:51.270
I didn't want that for my daughter.

01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:56.390
But it wasn't your choice to make.

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:15.390
Ben?

01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:18.150
- Ben?
- Oh!

01:17:18.190 --> 01:17:20.910
- Ben! Ben!
- Are you all right?

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:23.510
Where's my baby?
Where's my baby? Ben!

01:17:34.365 --> 01:17:36.045
Smells good.

01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:40.990
So do you.

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:43.950
Not now, Gid. I'm not in the mood.

01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:48.230
You never are any more.

01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:50.910
Whose fault's that?

01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:54.390

01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:00.070
What have you done?

01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:03.590
- Ahh!
- What have you done?

01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:07.150
Could we have the screen across,
Nurse Hicks?

01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:08.710
Of course.

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.790
Good afternoon, Inspector. Not more
questions?

01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:14.710
- I'm not sure there's much more I can tell you.
- I think there is.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:17.990
- I've spoken to Cuthbert Mukamba.
- You know why we're asking.

01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:21.910
We've also spoken to your parents.
It'll go better for you if you tell
the truth now.

01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:24.390
I don't understand what you're
talking about.

01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:27.830
You spent some time last year in
Rhodesia working for AmnOx.

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:30.430
While you were there,
you got involved with Cuthbert.

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:32.950
When you came back to England
you were carrying his child.

01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:36.990
Your parents weren't too pleased
about it, so they made arrangements.

01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:39.870
Miss Richardson, would you like to
come with me, please?

01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:43.990
The food-tampering, extortion, all
the rest of it, was your way of
getting back at them,

01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:47.790
of hurting them as badly as they'd hurt you.
- You've no idea.

01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:50.070
We know you couldn't do it by
yourself.

01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:52.630
The voice on the phone
making the ransom demand.

01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:55.870
If we played that to Simon
Hallward's parents, they'd
identify him.

01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:58.070
But there was a third.
Hallward was dead

01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:01.310
by the time you faked your
kidnapping. So, who helped you?

01:19:04.150 --> 01:19:05.790
Who's Tad, Verity?

01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:09.870
- An American boy I met in Rhodesia.
- Really?

01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:13.110
Sure it's not Thelma Anne Davis?
T-A-D?

01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:15.390
Verity, you don't have to say
anything...

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:18.110
My daughter is in no fit state to be
questioned.

01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:19.910
If you wish to do so, do so
formally...

01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:21.870
If you want to hurt them, now's the
time.

01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:23.870
- What do you want to know?
- Darling...

01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:27.030
- No! You don't call me that!
- Please. Think of your father.

01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:30.630
When did he ever think of me?
When did either of you think of me?

01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:34.790
"Richardsons - for all the family."

01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:42.470
I'll answer your questions.

01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:46.710
But not with these people here.

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:52.550
You stupid, stupid girl!

01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:54.870
Please, Gideon!
Please let me keep him.

01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:57.750
It's not a puppy! It's a child!
Someone else's child!

01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:59.670
- God help me...
- You're mean!

01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:01.870
- You don't love me.
- Love you?

01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:06.030
You're a maniac. You take it back
today! Or I will!

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:10.390
- So who was her accomplice?
- Thelma Anne Davis, sir.

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:15.110
Her previous just came through. She
was sent to an approved school aged
11 for arson.

01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:16.830
She burned down a sports hall.

01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:18.990
These days she calls herself Ayesha.

01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:22.190
One of Gideon Finn's disciples
up at House Beautiful.

01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:24.670
I think that's how she got to know
Hallward.

01:20:24.710 --> 01:20:28.550
I think maybe the original idea
was to hurt the Richardsons through
extortion,

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:32.630
but once Leo Richardson refused to
pay, they struck on the notion of
faking a kidnap.

01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:35.470
- Then why did they kill Hallward?
- Because he went too far.

01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:38.110
With Leo Richardson dragging his
heels about paying up,

01:20:38.150 --> 01:20:40.510
Hallward got impatient and upped the
stakes.

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:42.230
From his notebooks, it's clear

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:45.110
Hallward increased the arsenic dose
in the bloater paste.

01:20:45.150 --> 01:20:47.350
Sadly for Miss Figgis, with fatal
consequences.

01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:51.030
The glass in the baby food was a
step too far.

01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:54.470
I don't think Verity and Ayesha had
intended anyone

01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:57.350
to come to serious harm, certainly
not women or children.

01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:00.190
He had crossed the line
and had to go.

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:04.430
He'd already recorded the ransom
demand,

01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:06.630
so they had no further use for him.

01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:11.190
We stood no chance of identifying
the voice on the tape because
Hallward was already dead.

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:16.310
So how did Verity even meet this
Ayesha girl?

01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:19.150
They were at the same abortion
clinic at the same time.

01:21:19.190 --> 01:21:21.670
It would have meant prison
for Gideon Finn.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.950
He was the father, according
to Verity.

01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:27.630
I don't doubt they said Ayesha was
16. She was 15 when she fell pregnant
by him.

01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:31.750
What about the chalk mine? Verity
Richardson would have been killed in
that explosion.

01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:34.790
She was never in any danger, sir.
It was all for show.

01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:38.070
The explosion was detonated from a
safe distance by her accomplice

01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:39.870
once she'd seen
that Verity was clear.

01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:10.150
Hello, Tadpole.

01:22:10.190 --> 01:22:13.430
Ssh. Who's upset you?

01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:18.670
I'm afraid the jig's up.

01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:21.430
They'll be coming.

01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:35.790
We give thanks to the earth, mother
of all, for her fine, fair bounty.

01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:40.830
We give thanks for the barley
and the sweet vegetables

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:43.750
raised by the sweat of our labour
from this good earth.

01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:51.070
We give thanks for our fellowship,

01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:53.310
and the company of honest hearts.

01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:57.510
And today, we give a special thanks
to Sister Ayesha

01:22:57.550 --> 01:23:00.270
for the meal she has so thoughtfully
prepared

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:02.510
and set before us so lovingly...

01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:05.310
My God, don't you ever get sick of
the sound of your voice?

01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:12.790
Ready?

01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:14.430
Don't let me go alone.

01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:16.390
No, I can't, Tadpole. I can't.

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:18.590
I thought
I was brave enough but I'm not.

01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:20.910
I need you!

01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:24.830
Sister?

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:32.230
You think this is heaven?
This is hell.

01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:35.310
Thelma Anne Davis,
Verity Richardson, I...

01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:38.470
What is it? What's she taken?

01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:41.310
About 50 Librium.
The arsenic was meant for me.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.830
Fetch an ambulance.

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:47.070
Thelma.

01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:49.750
(THELMA GROANS)

01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:06.550
There was nothing they could do.

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:11.790
This was meant to be a refuge.

01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:14.870
A place of kindness.

01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:20.390
- It was a dream. My dream.
- The less out of you, the better.

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:23.870
Your dream? You exploited a
vulnerable young girl.

01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:26.230
- If I had my way,
you'd answer for it.
- Sir! Sir!

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:27.430
She was ill-used!

01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:40.350
We were going to found an orphanage
in Africa.

01:24:41.150 --> 01:24:42.830
Use the money for something good.

01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:56.910
So One-eye'd Jakes
will no longer be a lone ranger.

(LAUGHTER)

01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:02.590
He's reached his High Noon
and found his Darling Clementine.

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:04.590
So the way I look at it,

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:08.270
we're not so much losing a Detective
Sergeant as gaining a cowboy.

01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:10.470
- The happy couple.
- Happy couple.

01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:13.230
I believe Mr Bright has
something to say to you, too.

01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:16.270
In light of your late exploits at
the chalk tunnels,

01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:20.470
I have made a recommendation
for the Queen's Police Medal.

01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:23.830
I am assured that the request
will be looked upon favourably.

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:26.630
So, very well done, very well
deserved. Congratulations.

01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:30.870
- Very, very well done.
- Thank you, sir.

01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:42.790
Morse! Are you not coming in?

01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:46.110
- Work.
- Right.

01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:51.990
Well... I suppose...

01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:59.710
Your other half.
I'm sorry, I don't know her name.

01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:01.430
Hope.

01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:07.150
- Make a go of it.
- I mean to.

01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:10.630
Step to, matey.
Your pint's getting cold.

01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:07.910
- Any sign of Gideon Finn or his disciples?
- Not a soul.

01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:11.270
- Cleared out.
- It looks that way.

01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:18.110
What'll they do, do you think?
Back to the nine-to-five?

"The world was all before them,

01:27:22.110 --> 01:27:26.270
where to choose their place of rest

They hand in hand
with wandering steps

01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:34.070
and slow through Eden took their
solitary way."

No. I'm glad.
