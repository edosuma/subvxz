02:43.329 --> 02:45.126
My name is Dan Scott.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.924
I killed my brother.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.618
Her heart rate's dropping.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.025
Come on, Karen, just breathe.

03:16.629 --> 03:19.063
Come on, Haley, just breathe.

03:19.632 --> 03:22.829
You're doing good, baby.
You're doing so good.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.426
I'm right here.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.705
Come on, Mom. I'm right here.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.505
She's coded.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.903
Mom!

03:49.529 --> 03:50.689
Karen?

04:07.180 --> 04:08.306
Yuck!

04:10.083 --> 04:11.345
Who's that?

04:14.821 --> 04:16.345
Don't you know?

04:20.860 --> 04:22.760
She's our daughter.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.295
Mommy, Daddy, come play with me.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.741
- Goodness.
- What flower is this, Mommy?

04:40.013 --> 04:42.072
This is a lily.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.318
She's beautiful.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.826
Just like her mother.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.733
Mommy, come with me.

05:02.368 --> 05:04.598
You should go watch over her.

05:05.171 --> 05:06.832
I'll wait for you.

05:08.508 --> 05:09.873
It's okay.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.173
I'll be right here.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.689
Come with me, Mommy.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.430
Look for me in the lilies.

05:44.277 --> 05:48.236
There's my girl. For you.
That's a beautiful lily.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.417
Stats and vitals rising.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.120
We got her back.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.805
"Now is the time for us to shine.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.737
"A time when our dreams are within reach
and possibilities vast."

06:23.383 --> 06:25.851
<i>"Now is the time for all of us</i>

06:28.721 --> 06:31.918
<i>"to become the people</i>
<i>we've always dreamed of being.</i>

06:36.729 --> 06:39.789
<i>"This is your world. You're here."</i>

06:41.701 --> 06:43.168
It's a boy.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.304
<i>"You matter."</i>

06:46.606 --> 06:48.870
You did good. Just relax.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.842
You're a dad.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.604
You did so good.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.607
You did so good.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.916
We have a son. We have a son.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.709
I wanna see him.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.579
Hi. Hi, baby.

07:04.657 --> 07:05.988
<i>"The world is waiting."</i>

07:06.058 --> 07:07.116
Jim.

07:08.327 --> 07:11.660
Welcome to the world, James Lucas Scott.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.431
Look, it's your daddy.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.367
He's so beautiful.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.033
That's your daddy.

07:39.292 --> 07:43.558
Unbelievable. He's only mellow
when we play rap music?

07:44.430 --> 07:47.194
What happened to the classical music
I played for nine months?

07:47.266 --> 07:49.234
Well, I got a confession to make.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.931
Every time you fell asleep,
I went to old-school hip-hop.

07:53.005 --> 07:57.704
That's my boy, isn't it? That's my boy.
You like some old-school hip-hop, huh?

07:58.411 --> 07:59.503
Yeah.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.714
Hi, Keith, it's us.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.118
Her name is Lily.

08:15.461 --> 08:17.088
Lily Roe-Scott.

08:18.364 --> 08:19.490
Hi.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.801
And I'm gonna be seeing you
in her every day.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.402
Hi.

08:31.277 --> 08:32.642
Hi, Lily.

08:32.879 --> 08:37.248
You're such a good baby.
You're such a good baby.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.178
- You've got to be kidding me. Again?
- I guess.

08:51.163 --> 08:53.654
Doesn't look like anything's wrong.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.092
You sure it won't start?

08:56.602 --> 08:57.899
Peyton?

08:59.238 --> 09:00.728
Oh, the car's fine.

09:00.806 --> 09:04.071
I was just feeling sentimental
about the first time we spoke.

09:04.143 --> 09:07.544
Feeling sentimental or avoiding packing
for your trip to Los Angeles

09:07.613 --> 09:09.137
with Brooke tomorrow?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.676
I don't wanna go.

09:12.084 --> 09:15.212
I mean, I do wanna go.
I'm just... I'm gonna miss you.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.585
Come on, look.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.716
At least you know what you're gonna do.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.987
You still haven't decided yet?

09:22.061 --> 09:25.690
I just didn't see this other thing coming,
you know?

09:26.232 --> 09:29.724
- Can I help you?
- I don't think so.

09:30.269 --> 09:35.036
I just keep telling myself that
there will be some significant moment

09:35.708 --> 09:38.142
when I will know what to do.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.837
How about you? Can I help you?

09:43.049 --> 09:44.243
Yeah.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.442
Remember when
your mom was in the hospital

09:46.519 --> 09:49.386
and you asked me
just to lie with you and heal you?

09:49.622 --> 09:50.714
Yeah.

09:51.991 --> 09:55.154
I think I could use some of that healing
before tomorrow.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.456
I can do that.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.641
So you know there's a big party tonight,
kind of a last hurrah for all the seniors.

10:11.711 --> 10:15.238
Yeah, I know,
but what are we gonna do with the baby?

10:15.681 --> 10:18.343
Cue the crazy grandmother.

10:19.151 --> 10:24.885
And, FYI, if either of you ever calls me
"grandmother" in public, I'll use my gun.

10:26.092 --> 10:28.390
Which is at the range,

10:28.561 --> 10:33.794
safe from the most beautiful baby boy
in the world.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.430
Next to you, Nathan, of course.

10:36.602 --> 10:41.164
Oh, who am I kidding, you are the cutest.
You, you, you.

10:43.342 --> 10:45.276
Go. I'll watch him.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.175
Oh, I don't know.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.574
We're under age, Mom,

10:48.648 --> 10:52.709
and there's gonna be drinking, alcohol,
probably some drugs.

10:53.019 --> 10:55.419
You're going to the party
and you're going to have fun.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.819
We insist.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.650
Now, go.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.882
Bring me home some drugs.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.524
Isn't Grandma funny? Isn't she?

11:10.569 --> 11:11.627
Wow.

11:13.539 --> 11:15.336
So what's the deal
with this party anyway?

11:15.408 --> 11:18.377
Well, at midnight the Tree Hill High
computers change over

11:18.444 --> 11:20.435
and the juniors become seniors.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.279
So what happens to us?

11:22.348 --> 11:25.181
- We're gone.
- I don't want to be gone.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.082
Well, you got till midnight.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.314
Hey, let me ask you guys something.

11:29.388 --> 11:32.084
Does it look like I'm wearing a blouse?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.952
- I like it.
- It's a little...

11:35.761 --> 11:38.195
Great. I'm the blouse man.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.592
It looks like I'm competing
in men's ice dancing, doesn't it?

11:40.666 --> 11:41.928
- No.
- No, it looks like

11:42.001 --> 11:43.195
you're winning men's ice dancing.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.794
- Stop it. It's fine.
- I'm just playing.

11:45.871 --> 11:49.398
As long as you don't have wine coolers
in that bag, you're good.

11:50.443 --> 11:51.671
You know what? You guys go ahead.

11:51.744 --> 11:54.178
I'm gonna grab my jacket.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.011
Hey, listen.
I'm gonna stay out of your way tonight

12:00.086 --> 12:02.077
'cause I know you got a lot of people
to say goodbye to,

12:02.154 --> 12:04.520
before you leave tomorrow.

12:04.590 --> 12:05.784
Thanks.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.854
Maybe I don't even have to go.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.727
I mean, what do interns do anyway?
They, like, answer phones.

12:12.798 --> 12:16.632
I already know how to answer phones.
Look. Hello?

12:18.904 --> 12:21.270
You're going and you're gonna have fun.

12:22.274 --> 12:23.707
Okay, we'll have fun.

12:23.776 --> 12:26.973
I'm just saying, maybe I should give Deb
one quick call, just to check in.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.172
Hales, come on.

12:28.247 --> 12:32.013
I miss the boy, too, but we're not gonna be
those crazy obsessive parents, all right?

12:32.084 --> 12:35.417
You need to enjoy one last night
with all your friends.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.615
Okay. I won't call.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.124
All right. This night's gonna rock.

12:40.192 --> 12:44.424
This night's gonna suck.
I can't believe they're gonna erase us.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.159
I see possibilities in a night like this.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.597
It's your last chance to tell someone
you love them,

12:49.668 --> 12:53.035
maybe apologize to an old friend,
try something new.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.435
This night has greatness
written all over it. I can feel it.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.703
Okay.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.335
Name?

12:59.411 --> 13:00.878
Brooke Davis.

13:01.147 --> 13:04.548
I'm sorry. I've got strict orders
not to admit Brooke Davis.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.845
Excuse me?

13:05.918 --> 13:07.977
Whose stupid party is this, anyway?

13:08.053 --> 13:09.918
It's mine, bitch.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.347
And your fat ass isn't invited.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.550
Hi!

13:14.794 --> 13:16.318
Oh, my God.

13:28.340 --> 13:32.572
Well, if it isn't the only guy to ever
leave me in a hotel room before the sex.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.239
Well, well, come here.

13:36.882 --> 13:39.248
Where you been?
What are you doing here?

13:39.518 --> 13:43.420
Where I've been is a long story.
What I'm doing here is pretty easy.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.320
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

13:47.459 --> 13:50.587
Hang out with her too long,
you're gonna end up in Honey Grove.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.131
I need to borrow you.
Come with me, boy and friend.

13:53.199 --> 13:56.362
- Where to?
- Someone's playing spin the bottle.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.699
Spin the bottle? What are we, 13?

13:58.771 --> 14:00.830
Shut up. God.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.674
Look, if you ask me, it's really stupid

14:03.742 --> 14:05.471
that we all ever stopped playing
spin the bottle,

14:05.544 --> 14:06.533
so quit being so grumpy.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.671
Hey, you'd be grumpy, too
if a girl you had history with

14:08.747 --> 14:10.738
just showed up out of the blue.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.414
Mouth.

14:17.256 --> 14:18.883
You were saying?

14:23.395 --> 14:24.692
Hi.

14:30.402 --> 14:34.805
Hey, Deb. Hi. It's me.
I'm sorry to bother you.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.138
I just wanted to check in, yeah.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.506
Everything's great? Great.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.374
Okay. Good. Good. All right. Thanks.

14:40.446 --> 14:44.007
Oh, also, can you just not
tell Nathan that I called,

14:44.083 --> 14:45.983
this time or last time?

14:46.986 --> 14:48.146
Thanks.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.656
Also before you go, he really likes his little

14:53.158 --> 14:54.420
giraffe.

15:00.432 --> 15:03.060
That's for soaking me at the last party.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.194
The bitch-slap, I deserved.

15:06.505 --> 15:09.201
That's for flicking me
in the back of the head.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.939
I'm gonna miss this.

15:18.017 --> 15:21.578
Is that Nathan Scott,
big-time college basketball player?

15:21.654 --> 15:23.815
Small-time college basketball player.

15:23.889 --> 15:28.349
Well, whatever,
but congratulations, man, on everything.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.222
How's fatherhood?

15:31.563 --> 15:32.894
It's awesome.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.093
How's brotherhood?

15:35.167 --> 15:36.395
Awesome.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.663
- She's beautiful, Luke.
- Handsome kid.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.536
Looks like his uncle.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.511
We gotta go see him.

15:52.551 --> 15:54.018
Yeah, I know.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.117
But what do you say
to your father, the murderer?

15:58.991 --> 16:01.551
Whatever we say, we just get it over with.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.824
I'm tired of carrying it around
and avoiding him.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.161
Let's do it tonight.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.128
Let's stop running from him.

16:11.837 --> 16:12.929
Okay.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.840
Okay. We'll go later tonight then.

16:17.376 --> 16:19.640
I may need a few drinks first.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.308
Lucas.

16:26.185 --> 16:28.483
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

16:30.022 --> 16:31.887
I'm sorry I was right.

16:40.466 --> 16:41.490
<i>Brooke Davis,</i>

16:41.567 --> 16:45.298
<i>look to your right and you'll see</i>
<i>the hottest guy at the party.</i>

16:49.742 --> 16:52.233
- Hey.
- Hi, Tutor Mom.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.975
How are you feeling? You having fun,
or you worried about the kid?

16:55.047 --> 16:58.483
I am worried about you, too.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.378
I'm gonna miss you this summer.

17:00.452 --> 17:01.783
Okay, don't. Don't do that.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.686
Don't make me cry 'cause I'm barely
holding it together as it is.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.453
Nathan and I want you
to be James' godmother.

17:09.461 --> 17:11.895
Okay, that's gonna do it. Haley.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.161
I would be honored to be his godmother

17:18.237 --> 17:20.137
and I promise you
that unlike my ungodly mother,

17:20.204 --> 17:22.036
I will so kick ass at this.

17:22.107 --> 17:25.076
I know you will, as long as you don't say
"kick ass" around him too much.

17:25.144 --> 17:27.112
Right. Sorry.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.054
Like your leather.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.251
- You're Shelly, right?
- Yeah.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.385
We had Current Events together, right?

17:43.462 --> 17:45.020
Right. Yeah.

17:45.297 --> 17:48.824
Hey, I just wanted to tell you,
I think Clean Teens is really cool.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.234
Thanks. I kind of ended it.

17:53.472 --> 17:55.303
Well, it's still really brave of you.

17:55.374 --> 17:58.832
I totally would've joined
if I didn't love sex so much.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.069
- That's a joke.
- Yeah.

18:02.881 --> 18:05.816
Man, Clean Teen wardrobe
sure has changed.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.743
I want back in.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.118
Look at this. It's like a Clean Teen reunion.

18:10.189 --> 18:14.125
All we need now is Chase,
but honestly he's not that clean.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.161
He appreciates the art
of a dirty text message.

18:16.228 --> 18:18.560
Come on. Come on. Come on.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.622
I don't suppose the Clean Teen
dances much?

18:44.690 --> 18:46.157
Oh, please.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.556
I was doing the whole slut thing
long before you, bitch.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.853
What? It's catchy.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.998
You believe in miracles, Skills?

19:31.837 --> 19:34.567
'Cause there's no way in hell
a couple of vagabonds like us

19:34.640 --> 19:37.006
walked off to River Court
and won the State Championship.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.167
Yeah.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.939
Hey, you know my joint ain't too far off
from USC this year, right?

19:41.013 --> 19:43.208
We gonna be boys for life.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.715
Hey, you guys play Nathan and Whitey
next season?

19:48.554 --> 19:52.251
December 9th, 3:00.
And I plan to score at 3:01, 3:02 and 3:03.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.815
- You're gonna be there, right?
- We'll see.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.623
"We'll see"? You know what?
Kill all that "boys for life" talk, dog.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.459
Matter of fact,
we ain't even friends right now.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.896
All right.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.163
Yo, Skills, check this out!

20:03.235 --> 20:04.759
I'll be right back.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.235
Hey, Skills.

20:06.438 --> 20:08.565
All right, let's go see Dan.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.640
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure. Why? Aren't you?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.679
I don't know.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.882
Scott.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.724
Visitation.

20:48.847 --> 20:52.112
I have a daughter. Her name is Lily.

20:53.819 --> 20:58.313
And someday when she's old enough,
she's gonna ask me where her daddy is,

20:59.391 --> 21:00.756
who he was,

21:01.326 --> 21:02.918
and how he died.

21:04.930 --> 21:10.061
And on that day,
I'm gonna look into her beautiful eyes,

21:10.135 --> 21:15.471
eyes that don't know of malice
and jealousy and evil,

21:17.542 --> 21:19.476
and I'm gonna say,

21:27.953 --> 21:30.945
"Your father loved his younger brother
very much,

21:31.189 --> 21:34.989
"and that brother took him from you,
for your entire life.

21:39.798 --> 21:42.858
"He made sure
you would never know your father."

21:46.138 --> 21:47.298
Karen...

22:22.174 --> 22:25.166
Tell them I don't wanna drink.
I just wanna be upside down.

22:25.243 --> 22:26.972
You guys look funny.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.815
So you ready to leave tomorrow?

22:35.253 --> 22:36.914
Hey, what's wrong?

22:38.490 --> 22:40.117
I don't know. I just...

22:41.927 --> 22:44.259
I know moving on's a good thing.

22:44.930 --> 22:48.229
I guess I'm just scared, you know?

22:48.600 --> 22:52.661
High school's safe and I'm not sure
I'm ready for the real world.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.008
For the past few months,
I've been writing this.

23:01.079 --> 23:04.105
I guess, in part, so I could remember it all.

23:04.783 --> 23:06.273
But...

23:08.286 --> 23:09.275
Here.

23:14.993 --> 23:17.223
"She was fiercely independent.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.690
"Brooke Davis.

23:21.133 --> 23:25.092
"Brilliant and beautiful and brave.

23:26.138 --> 23:30.040
"In two years, she had grown more
than anyone I had ever known.

23:32.377 --> 23:34.937
"Brooke Davis is gonna
change the world some day.

23:35.013 --> 23:37.538
"And I'm not sure she even knows it."

23:39.684 --> 23:41.914
You're gonna do great, Brooke.

23:44.222 --> 23:46.622
The world doesn't stand a chance.

23:46.858 --> 23:48.348
Thank you.

24:01.306 --> 24:03.467
Hey, Shelly, nice moves.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.736
Thanks.

24:05.310 --> 24:08.074
Hey, Shelly. Nice skirt.

24:08.713 --> 24:12.444
So, are you gonna let me slide you
out of that at church camp again, or what?

24:12.851 --> 24:14.842
Come on, slut.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.479
What did you say?

24:17.656 --> 24:18.987
Mouth, it's okay.

24:19.057 --> 24:20.718
No, it's not okay.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.320
Oh, no?

24:22.627 --> 24:23.958
Whatever, geek.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.764
What are you doing?

24:26.898 --> 24:28.388
Do you believe this?

24:32.003 --> 24:34.870
You know, I was gonna take it easy on...

24:37.108 --> 24:38.575
Yeah, me, too.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.110
He's sorry. You look great.

24:48.286 --> 24:51.016
Oh, my gosh.
Nathan, your baby is so beautiful!

24:51.089 --> 24:52.078
He is, isn't he?

24:52.157 --> 24:54.022
Hi, sorry, can we just have a second?

24:54.092 --> 24:56.322
- Congratulations, Haley.
- Thank you, Reese.

24:56.394 --> 24:58.453
- We need to go home.
- Why, what is it?

24:58.530 --> 24:59.895
Because, I know we promised
we wouldn't do this

24:59.965 --> 25:02.695
but I called just to check in on the baby,
and Deb's not answering the phone.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.325
There's no busy signal.
There's no answering machine

25:04.402 --> 25:05.869
- and she's not answering her cell either.
- Okay. Okay.

25:05.937 --> 25:08.235
Let's not freak out, okay?
It doesn't mean my mom's not on top of it.

25:08.306 --> 25:10.365
You mom, the former drug addict,
attempted murderer,

25:10.442 --> 25:12.706
who dropped a loaded gun in the cafe?

25:13.011 --> 25:15.002
- Wouldn't hurt to check on her.
- Right.

25:20.318 --> 25:23.219
I thought about calling you
a million times.

25:24.589 --> 25:26.250
Are you mad at me?

25:26.558 --> 25:27.718
No, I'm not.

25:28.093 --> 25:30.994
I just stayed away
because you asked me to.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.129
No Clean Teen shirt, huh?

25:36.034 --> 25:37.160
No.

25:37.769 --> 25:39.634
It was time to end it.

25:42.340 --> 25:44.308
I was just trying to find my place,
you know?

25:44.376 --> 25:45.468
Yeah.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.884
You'll always be important to me, Shelly.

26:01.693 --> 26:02.921
Mouth.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.566
I like the skirt.

26:25.817 --> 26:28.752
- Hey, you. What you been up to?
- Flirting with Lucas.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.617
Oh, yeah? How'd that turn out?

26:30.689 --> 26:33.886
So-so. You know,
love triangles are so high school.

26:33.959 --> 26:35.290
Seriously.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.195
We made it, didn't we?

26:40.899 --> 26:46.701
Through all the tragedy and jealousy
and confusion, we made it.

26:48.206 --> 26:51.369
Yeah. Clothes Over Bro's, right?

26:53.778 --> 26:55.803
I love you, P. Sawyer.

26:58.049 --> 26:59.778
I love you, too, B. Davis.

27:01.987 --> 27:04.649
Almost midnight. End of an era.

27:04.723 --> 27:08.352
Four years of high school
and zero girlfriends for Junk and Fergie.

27:08.526 --> 27:09.823
You know my girlfriend's Canadian.

27:09.894 --> 27:11.384
Man, whatever.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.564
What you thinking about, Marv?

27:23.508 --> 27:24.975
I'll be right back.

27:38.189 --> 27:39.816
Hey, Mouth, what...

27:42.661 --> 27:45.391
Yeah, Mouth! Where's my dog!

27:45.463 --> 27:47.454
I always wanted to do that.

27:47.799 --> 27:49.767
- Okay.
- Sorry.

27:54.472 --> 27:56.372
- Did you...
- I said you can hang out.

27:56.441 --> 27:57.533
I didn't say you can make out.

27:57.609 --> 28:01.568
Do you see what happens
when you leave me alone all night?

28:01.946 --> 28:06.007
I mean, seriously, thank you for letting me
say goodbye to all my friends.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.085
But you're the one
I wanna finish the night with.

28:09.154 --> 28:10.917
I was hoping you were gonna say that.

28:10.989 --> 28:13.651
How about you kiss me
until I have to leave tomorrow?

28:13.892 --> 28:15.359
It's a start.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.922
Come on.

28:18.730 --> 28:19.924
- Deb?
- Mom?

28:23.735 --> 28:25.566
Mom, what happened to the phone?

28:25.637 --> 28:27.696
- I unplugged it.
- Why?

28:28.373 --> 28:31.308
Because the two of you
were driving us crazy.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.866
The two of us?

28:33.178 --> 28:35.146
I might've called a couple of times.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.237
Six times.

28:36.314 --> 28:38.748
You crazy, obsessive parent.

28:39.084 --> 28:40.711
You called eight.

28:41.953 --> 28:43.386
I miss him.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.786
He's fine.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.981
Now go back to the party and have fun.

28:48.059 --> 28:51.153
You have the rest of your lives
to worry about children.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.491
Trust me.

28:58.036 --> 28:59.833
All right, you wanna go back?

28:59.904 --> 29:02.429
Yeah. Hey, hold on a second.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.506
You're gonna be a great mom,
you know that?

29:05.577 --> 29:07.442
Actually you already are a great mother

29:07.512 --> 29:09.377
and that's very sexy.

29:09.447 --> 29:10.675
Really?

29:16.221 --> 29:17.415
We don't have to go back right away.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.320
You're absolutely right.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.159
Did I mention this was the greatest
night of my life?

29:56.227 --> 29:58.923
Well, you said it was a night to be great
and to try new things.

29:58.997 --> 30:01.932
So, I figured we'd do both at once.

30:04.702 --> 30:07.000
You gonna change the world some day,
Brooke Davis?

30:07.071 --> 30:09.335
Yeah. So I've been told.

30:10.008 --> 30:11.703
Be gentle with me.

30:21.019 --> 30:22.919
I don't want you to go.

30:23.221 --> 30:24.313
What?

30:25.557 --> 30:27.047
I'm sorry. I just...

30:28.793 --> 30:31.626
I've been trying to put a good face on it.

30:31.863 --> 30:33.854
God, I love you so much, Peyton.

30:34.365 --> 30:36.265
So you want me to stay?

30:36.701 --> 30:37.793
Yeah.

30:38.736 --> 30:40.465
Then I'll stay.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.240
No, you won't.

30:45.109 --> 30:48.738
I just... I want you to stay,

30:49.814 --> 30:51.406
but I won't let you.

30:52.317 --> 30:53.944
And do you know why?

30:55.720 --> 31:00.453
Because I've told you before,
you're destined for greatness

31:02.427 --> 31:04.725
and it starts tomorrow morning.

31:05.096 --> 31:07.291
It's not gonna matter anyway,

31:07.832 --> 31:10.266
whether I stay or I go, with us.

31:12.670 --> 31:15.434
Because I'm gonna love you
forever, Lucas Scott.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.939
Yeah, so am I.

31:17.108 --> 31:19.042
Hey, where have you guys been?

31:19.110 --> 31:21.044
I don't know. Around.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.807
Hey, you got a sec, Luke?

31:23.882 --> 31:24.974
Yeah.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.152
All right, let me see that baby.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.816
- Oh, God, Nathan.
- Not bad, huh?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.383
- Good work, buddy.
- I made that.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.990
So? Tell me that was the greatest
60 seconds of your life.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.397
Stop it. It was great.

31:43.768 --> 31:45.861
So great you're gonna stay?

31:46.004 --> 31:48.905
Not really that great.

31:49.807 --> 31:51.604
Suddenly I feel used.

31:52.377 --> 31:56.108
But it's okay, considering I've been used
by Brooke Davis.

31:56.281 --> 31:57.509
Shut up.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.812
You know I'm lying.

32:02.487 --> 32:04.978
I am gonna miss you. I already do.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.222
You've become such a big part of my life.

32:09.294 --> 32:13.253
Sometimes I think it's strange
that I didn't know you till now.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.533
That's okay.

32:19.037 --> 32:22.234
Put me in your heart
and go see everything, Brooke,

32:22.307 --> 32:24.036
and then come back to me.

32:33.451 --> 32:36.750
I'm sad. I am sad. I...

32:37.121 --> 32:40.249
It just hit me today that you and I
have been together

32:40.325 --> 32:42.350
pretty much every day of our life

32:42.427 --> 32:43.689
and now we're gonna have to
say goodbye soon.

32:43.761 --> 32:45.592
- We're not gonna...
- Hales...

32:46.130 --> 32:49.156
Look, I just... I really want you to know
that I love you,

32:49.233 --> 32:52.794
and there's a reason why
our son's middle name is Lucas.

32:53.137 --> 32:55.970
You had Keith
and James is gonna have you

32:56.741 --> 32:59.710
and Nathan and I would like

32:59.777 --> 33:03.611
for his Uncle Lucas
to also be his godfather.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.647
Thank you. I would love to.

33:09.721 --> 33:10.813
Good.

33:11.789 --> 33:15.156
I just... I hope he learns how
to follow his heart like you do.

33:16.527 --> 33:18.620
I'm really gonna miss you, Luke.

33:20.198 --> 33:21.722
No, you're not.

33:25.036 --> 33:27.834
What do you mean? What's so funny?

33:29.540 --> 33:31.633
Do you wanna hear a secret?

33:41.352 --> 33:42.444
What?

33:54.665 --> 33:55.757
Hey.

33:56.100 --> 33:58.534
- Where you been?
- Having sex.

33:58.736 --> 33:59.964
You're funny.

34:01.406 --> 34:03.636
I have something for you.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.610
Turner gave it to me.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.505
Happy graduation.

34:14.284 --> 34:16.446
You told him the truth, didn't you?

34:16.621 --> 34:17.781
Maybe.

34:25.696 --> 34:28.529
You know, of all the schools
I got suspended from,

34:29.734 --> 34:31.929
I'm glad I graduated from this one.

34:33.337 --> 34:34.531
Me, too.

34:46.484 --> 34:48.179
I've been thinking about Dan.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.344
Yeah?

34:49.887 --> 34:51.786
Why should we go see him?

34:51.856 --> 34:53.221
You mean tonight?

34:53.291 --> 34:54.952
No, I mean at all.

34:55.927 --> 35:01.194
I mean, he's had control over us
since we were born.

35:03.234 --> 35:05.896
But these are our lives now, Nathan.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.463
I say we go on without him.

35:09.540 --> 35:12.270
I say we never go see him.

35:13.211 --> 35:14.303
Ever.

35:17.582 --> 35:21.780
I know it sounds horrible to say,
but I'm okay with that.

35:22.220 --> 35:25.212
I mean, I got a great wife.
I got a beautiful baby son,

35:25.289 --> 35:27.416
and I got a hell of a brother.

35:27.758 --> 35:32.923
Yeah. A hell of a brother
who's gonna be your coach.

35:36.701 --> 35:39.636
Whitey offered me
an assistant coaching job.

35:40.838 --> 35:41.862
I'm gonna take it.

35:41.939 --> 35:44.635
What? When did you decide this?

35:44.709 --> 35:47.678
About the same time
I became a godfather.

35:50.047 --> 35:52.880
That's great, man. We'll do it together.

35:55.419 --> 35:58.149
By the way, make sure you play well
on December 9th.

35:58.222 --> 36:00.816
If Skills beats us he's never gonna
let us hear the end of it.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.120
Yeah.

36:31.155 --> 36:35.615
Twelve! Eleven! Ten! Nine! Eight!

36:35.693 --> 36:38.389
- What's going on?
- It's almost midnight.

36:38.462 --> 36:43.399
Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

36:43.467 --> 36:45.162
We're seniors!

37:09.360 --> 37:11.260
High school kids.

37:12.463 --> 37:13.828
Let's get out of here, you guys.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.095
- Where to?
- I know a place open all night.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.600
Let's roll.

37:31.716 --> 37:33.377
Girls versus boys!

37:43.261 --> 37:45.593
If you give me that ball,
I will make it worth your while.

37:45.663 --> 37:47.597
- Sorry, guys.
- Sweet!

40:15.880 --> 40:18.280
Okay, we're not gonna do this.

40:18.582 --> 40:21.483
We're not gonna get sad.
Nothing's gonna change now.

40:21.752 --> 40:24.812
We'll all be friends forever. I know it.

40:24.889 --> 40:27.153
Look, in four years
we're gonna be right back here.

40:27.224 --> 40:30.682
We'll be done with college
or wherever we go.

40:31.529 --> 40:32.689
Right?

40:33.264 --> 40:34.356
Yeah.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.421
Hey.

40:35.499 --> 40:39.060
You ready for a rematch or are you afraid
you're gonna get worked?

40:40.337 --> 40:43.363
Do you really want to end your night
with a loss, huh?

40:50.347 --> 40:51.439
Come on, baby.

40:51.515 --> 40:55.542
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to another historic night.

40:55.619 --> 40:58.179
Yeah, let's go! Come on!

40:59.223 --> 41:00.588
Come on!

41:26.717 --> 41:29.049
You sure you're up for this, old man?

41:29.119 --> 41:31.451
I could do this forever, little brother.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.357
English

42:19.305 --> 42:25.784
