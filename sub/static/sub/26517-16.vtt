Thank you. I could feel it.

Do you still make
those candy cane mochas?

00:55.324 --> 00:57.265
I know the holidays are almost over,

00:57.290 --> 01:00.104
but what the hell,
I'm gonna treat myself.

01:00.129 --> 01:02.085
Okay. Thank you.

01:05.645 --> 01:08.990
- Hi.
- Oh! God.

01:10.216 --> 01:11.715
Okay, let's just put it out there.

01:11.740 --> 01:13.685
I've retired from stalking,
but you never lose the skills.

01:13.709 --> 01:14.641
You know?

01:14.710 --> 01:16.143
I'm sorry to violate your boundaries

01:16.211 --> 01:17.411
and your morning speed walk,

01:17.479 --> 01:19.146
but, um, ha, it's an emergency.

01:19.214 --> 01:20.280
Dr. Akopian...

01:21.359 --> 01:22.816
do you watch The Bachelor?

01:23.125 --> 01:24.128
Huh?

01:24.153 --> 01:25.986
Look, you know I've
been indecisive about

01:26.055 --> 01:27.788
the whole Josh, Nathaniel, Greg thing.

01:27.856 --> 01:29.189
Well, they proposed that I go

01:29.214 --> 01:30.491
on a final date with each of them,

01:30.559 --> 01:31.658
like The Bachelor.

01:31.727 --> 01:33.927
And then, I choose. Like The Bachelor.

01:34.039 --> 01:36.673
- Here you go.
- I know it's weird, and it's insane,

01:36.698 --> 01:37.809
and it's dumb, and it's lame,

01:37.833 --> 01:39.433
again, like The Bachelor...

01:39.458 --> 01:42.946
so, it's bad, right? I shouldn't do it?

01:42.971 --> 01:45.172
Do you forbid me from doing it?

01:48.322 --> 01:49.355
Well,

01:49.611 --> 01:52.093
um, it's consensual, right?

01:52.118 --> 01:54.548
And it's their idea?

01:54.659 --> 01:55.692
Yeah.

01:55.717 --> 01:57.651
You go into it with clear expectations,

01:57.676 --> 02:00.937
might be helpful to
settle on how you feel.

02:02.391 --> 02:04.157
Really? Wow.

02:04.182 --> 02:06.537
Just don't get into
any jacuzzi slap-fights.

02:08.835 --> 02:12.666
Rebecca, as long as you stay
grounded and present and open...

02:12.691 --> 02:14.515
I think I can be all those things, yeah.

02:14.903 --> 02:17.265
Then I don't think
there's any big harm in it.

02:18.757 --> 02:20.595
Oh, good. 'Cause I already
told them I'd do it anyway,

02:20.620 --> 02:22.920
and I got to make a
decision by next Thursday.

02:22.945 --> 02:24.611
You do realize

02:24.636 --> 02:25.756
that next Thursday

02:25.781 --> 02:27.848
is Valentine's Day, by the way?

02:27.916 --> 02:30.083
Oh, I do. It's apt, right?

02:30.108 --> 02:32.109
It's, uh, it's rather apt.

02:33.145 --> 02:34.644
So, what are you drinking?

02:36.754 --> 02:38.287
Can I have my morning back now?

02:38.312 --> 02:40.545
Absolutely. I'll see you for
my appointment later today.

02:43.132 --> 02:44.575
Look at this chair, though.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.600
It's like,

02:45.711 --> 02:47.411
I'm a little lady

02:47.436 --> 02:48.535
in a big chair.

02:48.703 --> 02:50.437
I'm a little lady
waiting for their mommy.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.228
You know? Okay. Bye.

02:52.494 --> 02:53.937
Oh.

02:54.443 --> 02:56.676
Bunch and Akops, back together again!

03:01.040 --> 03:02.773
All right, let's get started.

03:02.951 --> 03:04.551
Now we've all agreed
that there should be

03:04.620 --> 03:05.830
some ground rules for this thing,

03:05.854 --> 03:07.031
so I'll give you my suggestions first.

03:07.055 --> 03:08.755
I think there needs
to be a spending limit.

03:08.868 --> 03:09.800
Hold on.

03:09.984 --> 03:13.193
- Not fair.
- Uh, that's a great idea.

03:13.262 --> 03:14.861
It's not fair you're a billionaire,

03:14.886 --> 03:17.141
and you can, like, whisk her
off anywhere in the world.

03:17.166 --> 03:18.098
Mm-hmm.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.443
That's exactly right.

03:19.468 --> 03:22.302
So let's say a spending cap of... $50?

03:22.327 --> 03:24.014
What? No.

03:24.039 --> 03:26.673
What can you do with $50? Park?

03:26.898 --> 03:29.186
Agreed. $50.

03:29.211 --> 03:30.377
Fine. Fine.

03:30.445 --> 03:33.062
Okay, then the next rule is...

03:33.649 --> 03:35.081
everyone keeps their shirts on.

03:35.150 --> 03:37.050
- Mm-hmm.
- What? No way. No.

03:37.119 --> 03:38.952
No. Okay, I'm on a shred right now.

03:39.021 --> 03:40.387
My trainer always says,

03:40.412 --> 03:42.179
"When you're on a
cut, you got to strut."

03:42.204 --> 03:44.154
That's a good point. Shirts stay on.

03:44.179 --> 03:45.592
So that eliminates

03:45.661 --> 03:48.929
your advantage, Josh, and
yours as well, Nathaniel.

03:48.954 --> 03:51.890
Which leaves, uh, Greg...

03:52.835 --> 03:55.669
whose advantage is...

03:55.694 --> 03:56.773
Yeah, what is your thing?

03:56.798 --> 03:59.506
Yeah, what is the thing
you do that's, like, good?

03:59.531 --> 04:02.565
I do nothing. That's my special charm.

04:02.590 --> 04:05.390
Aw, no. Don't sell yourself short, bud.

04:05.415 --> 04:08.825
You're great at, um,
little remarks and comments.

04:08.850 --> 04:10.750
Oh, yeah, ladies love
remarks and comments,

04:10.819 --> 04:12.419
and they go nuts for asides.

04:12.444 --> 04:15.112
Look, you're right. You
don't need to neutralize me.

04:15.176 --> 04:18.076
Next to you two, I lose
every day of the week.

04:18.122 --> 04:19.321
Or do I?

04:24.199 --> 04:27.039
Heating up.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.839
Hi. Hi, hi, hi.

04:32.908 --> 04:34.541
Thank you for meeting me for breakfast.

04:34.610 --> 04:36.250
Oh, my God, Kevin's
new breakfast specials

04:36.311 --> 04:37.544
are a huge hit.

04:37.613 --> 04:39.846
Take one dollar off anything,
people lose their minds.

04:39.871 --> 04:42.843
Oh, I'm so sorry I can't do
girl group lunches anymore.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.308
My new job, I actually
have to show up to work.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.187
I also can't drive carpool, watch TV,

04:47.256 --> 04:48.622
or take a bath during the day.

04:48.690 --> 04:50.290
You take a bath during the day?

04:50.315 --> 04:51.414
Not anymore.

04:51.570 --> 04:53.904
Now I barely have time
to shave my armpits.

04:53.929 --> 04:56.630
I am full European hitchhiker
under this fancy blazer.

04:56.698 --> 05:00.600
And... I am barely making the
standard marital sex quota,

05:00.625 --> 05:02.124
four times a week.

05:03.281 --> 05:04.404
No, I know.

05:04.726 --> 05:07.217
I know, I know, it's embarrassing.

05:07.242 --> 05:08.842
We used to be so sexual.

05:09.109 --> 05:12.633
Well, I'm glad you're here,
because we need to discuss

05:12.658 --> 05:14.858
the real-life dating show
unfolding in front of us,

05:14.883 --> 05:17.517
- Rebecca's three dates.
- Yeah, mm,

05:17.542 --> 05:19.429
I don't know, though,
if we should be gossiping

05:19.454 --> 05:21.154
about Rebecca's love life.

05:21.179 --> 05:23.567
I mean, look, I learned
a long time ago that

05:23.592 --> 05:26.526
Rebecca's dating life
is not my entertainment.

05:26.551 --> 05:29.306
So, I just, you know,
it's just not healthy

05:29.331 --> 05:31.187
for either of us.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.045
That's really, really good,
Paula. So we'll talk about it,

05:34.070 --> 05:35.303
- and you can listen.
- Mm-hmm.

05:35.328 --> 05:38.171
So, Heath, who do you think she'll pick?

05:38.240 --> 05:39.240
Okay. So...

05:39.308 --> 05:41.031
- Josh!
- What?

05:41.063 --> 05:43.286
Okay, okay. I have come
full circle on this;

05:43.311 --> 05:44.988
it has to be Josh, and
let me tell you why.

05:45.013 --> 05:47.147
And then afterwards, I will
never say anything ever.

05:47.215 --> 05:51.217
She and Josh have
such an incredible history.

05:51.286 --> 05:53.086
And he's so evolved now.

05:53.155 --> 05:57.200
It is Team Josh! Okay,
I'm done, I'm done.

05:57.225 --> 05:58.773
I'm not talking anymore.

05:58.798 --> 06:01.261
- Okay, that is insane. That
is crazy talking. - Mm-hmm.

06:01.330 --> 06:03.063
Guys, it's got to be Nathaniel.

06:03.131 --> 06:05.965
Yeah, I know I used to think she
was meant to be with Greg,

06:05.990 --> 06:08.858
but then Nathaniel became
an actual decent person.

06:08.904 --> 06:10.103
Okay, volunteering

06:10.172 --> 06:12.205
at the jail. He tipped my staff

06:12.230 --> 06:13.596
a hundred bucks each at Christmas.

06:13.621 --> 06:15.320
Then I heard he put
on that prince costume

06:15.344 --> 06:18.278
and sang Rebecca's rewritten
song in that dumb play thing?

06:18.303 --> 06:20.157
If that's not love, what is?

06:20.182 --> 06:22.582
Also, he's so hot in an
Armie Hammer kind of way.

06:22.607 --> 06:24.761
Call me by his name,
know what I'm saying?

06:24.786 --> 06:25.863
I can't believe this.

06:25.887 --> 06:27.031
You used to agree with me about Greg.

06:27.055 --> 06:28.299
Okay, you want to talk about change?

06:28.323 --> 06:31.193
Let's talk about change.
Greg has also changed a ton.

06:31.218 --> 06:33.816
He is practically a
completely different actor now.

06:33.841 --> 06:34.985
And of course I'm saying "actor"

06:35.010 --> 06:36.507
in the political and legal sense.

06:37.299 --> 06:38.443
And ladies, let's not forget,

06:38.467 --> 06:41.468
- Josh left her at the altar.
- Right, so listen,

06:41.493 --> 06:43.560
if you circle back to Nathaniel...

06:43.672 --> 06:45.672
Oh, come on... Nathaniel, the cheater?

06:45.741 --> 06:48.274
He made a Tanya out of my Rebecca.

06:48.343 --> 06:51.311
It is Josh, it is Josh,
I would put money on it.

06:51.336 --> 06:53.447
Well, I think we learned in
Vegas you'd put money on anything,

06:53.472 --> 06:55.459
but you know what? So would I.

06:55.484 --> 06:58.585
I would put actual cash,
American, hard currency,

06:58.610 --> 07:00.630
dollars, on it being Nathaniel.

07:00.655 --> 07:02.489
Well, so would I. On Greg.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.001
Wait, wait, wait. Are
you guys talking about

07:05.033 --> 07:06.914
putting money on this whole
triple-date thing?

07:06.939 --> 07:09.553
- We want in. - Are we really
doing this? 'Cause I have

07:09.578 --> 07:11.598
a state-of-the-art odds
board I want to use

07:11.623 --> 07:13.401
on the Super Bowl, Oscars
and National Spelling Bee.

07:13.468 --> 07:15.435
That sweetie is ready to roll!

07:17.362 --> 07:20.663
I'm so excited, I'd like to
bet my entire life on Nathaniel.

07:20.688 --> 07:23.653
Ooh, I don't have cash,
but I do have Swiss francs.

07:24.679 --> 07:26.012
I always carry them with me.

07:26.037 --> 07:27.303
In case the economy collapses.

07:30.685 --> 07:32.619
There's no exchange
rate, so it's just one...

07:32.644 --> 07:35.109
Oh, wow, are we actually gambling

07:35.134 --> 07:36.400
on our friend's love life?

07:36.425 --> 07:38.625
I mean, it is happening,
whether we do it or not.

07:38.650 --> 07:40.202
I've spent so much time and
energy on Rebecca's drama,

07:40.227 --> 07:41.872
the least I can do is
make money off of it.

07:41.897 --> 07:43.596
Okay, how much? How much?

07:43.665 --> 07:45.386
A hundred down for my man Nathaniel.

07:47.469 --> 07:49.736
We got a hundred down on Nathaniel.

07:49.805 --> 07:52.272
Uh, what's going on here?

07:55.277 --> 07:56.476
Who's got twenties?

07:56.501 --> 07:58.634
People are talking about
betting on the three dates.

07:58.791 --> 08:01.291
- It's messed up.
- Unbelievable.

08:01.515 --> 08:02.726
Hey!

08:02.751 --> 08:05.071
Hey! Hey, stop it!

08:05.096 --> 08:07.864
Stop it, you animals. What
is wrong with all of you?

08:07.933 --> 08:09.433
These are your best friends.

08:09.458 --> 08:12.425
These people are human
beings with feelings,

08:12.450 --> 08:14.234
and you're using them to make money.

08:16.351 --> 08:17.664

How do I know if I'm winning?

11:51.590 --> 11:52.791
Well, on this board here,

11:52.816 --> 11:54.949
- we've got Greg, Nathaniel and Josh.
- Okay.

11:54.974 --> 11:56.283
And as the dates unfold and we get

11:56.308 --> 11:58.074
more information and new bets come in,

11:58.099 --> 11:59.400
Kevin will input the data,

11:59.425 --> 12:01.827
and the odds will be recalculated
on the computer.

12:02.479 --> 12:05.439
Whoever's on the top is the favorite.

12:05.464 --> 12:06.864
Hmm, okay, so,

12:06.889 --> 12:08.622
- Nathaniel's on top.
- Yes, but that means

12:08.647 --> 12:11.252
that Greg is an underdog,
and that pays out more.

12:11.463 --> 12:12.825
Well, that's great, so then Greg's good.

12:12.849 --> 12:14.115
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, great.

12:14.140 --> 12:15.585
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, well, I have to go.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.521
I got to sell some of my
expired cosmetics to my relatives

12:17.546 --> 12:19.346
so I can raise more money to bet on him.

12:20.623 --> 12:22.223
Here comes Greg.

12:22.248 --> 12:23.947
Kevin, you may not want him to see this.

12:23.972 --> 12:25.238
I got you.

12:25.262 --> 12:27.262
_

12:27.297 --> 12:30.264
So what do you have planned
for your date with Rebecca?

12:30.289 --> 12:33.813
- Not a ton.
- Greg, seriously, listen to me.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.437
You know that Josh and
Nathaniel are gonna pull out

12:36.462 --> 12:38.447
all the stops on these dates.

12:38.472 --> 12:41.143
They're gonna get things like
hot air balloons and sailboats

12:41.168 --> 12:42.935
and-and unicorns.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.059
Unicorns, Hector?

12:44.084 --> 12:46.084
They're gonna get multiple unicorns?

12:46.109 --> 12:48.119
Maybe. Uh... what are you gonna do?

12:48.518 --> 12:50.197
Pick her up in your
crappy car and take her

12:50.222 --> 12:51.855
- to the drive-through?
- Maybe.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.408
You just can't.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.825
You got to think of something great.

12:55.850 --> 12:57.658
I really don't think I need to.

12:57.683 --> 12:59.883
And that's not me being
cocky, that's just me knowing

12:59.908 --> 13:01.861
in my heart when I'm right for someone.

13:01.886 --> 13:05.854
I don't need to do any of
that goofy "romantic stuff."

13:06.703 --> 13:07.802
Hey, look at us,

13:07.827 --> 13:10.830
on time for your last baseball game.

13:11.405 --> 13:13.906
Oh, a couple of moms are late.

13:14.488 --> 13:17.502
Yeah, like, where's Cindy
McCadden? Like, where is she?

13:17.573 --> 13:19.908
She's probably on Chardonnay time,
you know what I'm saying?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.493
Oh, they say working moms drop the ball,

13:21.518 --> 13:24.313
and yet, behold, here I am.

13:24.338 --> 13:25.837
Can one have it all?

13:25.862 --> 13:28.296
Nay, I say yes, young Thomas,

13:28.791 --> 13:31.854
if one tries hard enough.

13:32.236 --> 13:33.283
What's that?

13:33.308 --> 13:35.768
Think it's the, uh,
sign-up for the banquet dinner.

13:35.793 --> 13:38.076
- Everyone's got to bring something.
- Ah, that's no problem.

13:38.312 --> 13:39.745
Let me sign up for something easy,

13:39.770 --> 13:42.337
like paper plates and plastic cutlery.

13:42.369 --> 13:43.853
Are you out of your mind?

13:43.963 --> 13:46.211
Do you really think plastic
cutlery is still available?

13:46.236 --> 13:48.219
I got here this morning at 9:00,

13:48.244 --> 13:51.516
and I had to sign up
to make kosher scones.

13:51.541 --> 13:54.138
Yeah. One Jew on our
team, and I have to bake

13:54.207 --> 13:56.477
under the supervision of a rabbi.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.869
Cindy McCadden got plastic cutlery,

13:58.937 --> 14:01.324
because she slept
outside the front door.

14:01.349 --> 14:03.283
Oh, ladies.

14:03.308 --> 14:06.343
Hi. Louise, good luck with those scones.

14:06.411 --> 14:08.345
I can give you Moyshe's
number if you like.

14:08.413 --> 14:11.014
Cindy, what... what's left?

14:11.330 --> 14:12.759
What's left on the list?

14:16.854 --> 14:18.286
Oh, my God.

14:18.311 --> 14:20.244
Get out of my way!

14:20.357 --> 14:22.290
Oh, my God.

14:22.315 --> 14:24.203
Cantaloupe wedges, taken;

14:24.228 --> 14:26.828
votive candles, taken;
string cheese, taken?

14:26.853 --> 14:29.221
Mom, this is the only one left.

14:30.067 --> 14:32.400
"Salmon for 60"?

14:32.425 --> 14:34.533
- Ooh.
- Ouch.

14:35.095 --> 14:37.729
Hey, uh, Paula, is everything okay?

14:37.797 --> 14:39.030
Sorry, Greg,

14:39.099 --> 14:41.099
no... I-I don't have time
to talk right now, Greg.

14:41.124 --> 14:43.102
- I was just trying to, uh...
- No, no, no, no, you don't understand.

14:43.127 --> 14:45.338
I-I got to get... Yeah, nope.

14:47.572 --> 14:49.951
- Whoa, what was all that about?
- I don't know.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.442
I was just trying to say hi.

14:51.554 --> 14:52.887
Yeah, she seemed preoccupied.

14:52.912 --> 14:54.011
Yeah, that's probably it.

14:54.036 --> 14:55.936
It's not like she doesn't like me.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.593
Though, we have had our ups and downs.

14:58.618 --> 15:00.318
Don't go out with Greg.

15:00.343 --> 15:02.931
Greg is just a whiny little bitch.

15:02.956 --> 15:04.589
You're sleeping with Greg?!

15:04.614 --> 15:07.302
Sarcastic, alcoholic, unromantic Greg?

15:07.327 --> 15:10.595
He is completely shut
down, and he is angry.

15:10.620 --> 15:12.479
Paula, I get it. You don't like Greg.

15:15.111 --> 15:17.823
Huh. Well, you might
want to get into the ups,

15:17.848 --> 15:20.215
because she and Rebecca
are total besties.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.800
- Uh-huh.
- You're in a tight race right now,

15:21.841 --> 15:22.907
and that could tip it.

15:22.932 --> 15:26.054
Well, I don't think I need to, or do I?

15:26.122 --> 15:27.555
Well, you got stiff competition.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.380
She's on date number
one with Josh tonight,

15:29.405 --> 15:32.127
and that guy's got a
black belt in romance.

15:32.152 --> 15:33.651
Hmm.

15:37.690 --> 15:39.549
Oh.

15:40.570 --> 15:45.306
Here I am, and I am staying grounded

15:45.549 --> 15:47.098
and realistic.

15:47.123 --> 15:49.767
- What?
- No, Josh, uh, just hold... hold on.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.692
Okay, R-Rebecca, it's okay.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.448
Re-center.

15:53.473 --> 15:55.773
- And just breathe.
- What is it?

15:55.885 --> 15:58.686
Josh, I'll just be one
second, just one... I'm...

15:58.711 --> 16:00.111
I'm centered, I'm present, I'm here.

16:01.839 --> 16:03.105
You ready?

16:04.682 --> 16:05.593
Yeah.

Oh...

16:33.080 --> 16:34.813
Oh, my God.

16:36.716 --> 16:38.422
It's summer camp.

16:39.596 --> 16:41.963
- Oh, wow.
- Like it?

16:41.988 --> 16:44.155
Yeah.

16:44.268 --> 16:46.201
- First...
- Hmm?

16:46.226 --> 16:48.593
We dine alfresco.

16:48.770 --> 16:51.091
Oh.

16:54.995 --> 16:57.708
Let's, let's see...

16:58.014 --> 17:00.481
- Mmm.
- That just tastes so good.

17:00.506 --> 17:02.707
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

17:02.732 --> 17:05.133
You know what, seriously, I-I
hope the hot dogs are okay.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.157
- Yeah. - I spent most of
my money on the tent,

17:07.512 --> 17:10.325
I borrowed fake grass
from my mom's lawn.

17:10.349 --> 17:12.116
Hope that's not cheating.

17:12.141 --> 17:13.493
No, it's not. I would say

17:13.519 --> 17:15.853
it's acceptably within the guidelines.

17:15.964 --> 17:18.299
Okay, good.

17:18.324 --> 17:20.223
It's nice to go into the past like this.

17:20.336 --> 17:22.936
Oh, I'm not trying to
go back into the past.

17:23.048 --> 17:26.731
I-I'm trying to bring
us full circle, you know?

17:26.756 --> 17:30.601
Becks, there's always
been this feeling of destiny

17:30.714 --> 17:32.161
about me and you.

17:33.216 --> 17:36.091
Like, I-I don't know, like,

17:36.309 --> 17:39.310
someone out there is
telling a story about us.

17:41.281 --> 17:42.856
Yeah.

17:43.710 --> 17:46.177
It does feel that way sometimes.

17:48.981 --> 17:50.313
Come with me.

17:52.243 --> 17:54.058
Hello...

17:54.127 --> 17:56.016
Oh.

17:56.239 --> 17:58.506
Hey. Real pillows.

17:58.531 --> 17:59.730
Ah. Nice touch.

17:59.843 --> 18:01.142
Well, I remember at camp,

18:01.167 --> 18:02.733
you brought your own pillows from home,

18:02.758 --> 18:07.048
and, uh, you made me cover them
with a rain poncho before we,

18:07.073 --> 18:08.940
you know, uh...

18:09.052 --> 18:12.020
I, you know...

18:12.328 --> 18:16.347
I didn't want to get them dirty
because they were orthotic.

18:16.572 --> 18:18.939
So you know, I was
careful not to get your...

18:19.703 --> 18:22.954
on them after we.

18:22.979 --> 18:24.212
Yeah.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.788
Uh, close your eyes.

18:29.813 --> 18:31.629
I-I have a surprise for you.

18:31.698 --> 18:33.776
Which is, incidentally, what
you said the night you missed

18:33.800 --> 18:35.311
and got the pillow and
then my ear, but okay,

18:35.335 --> 18:36.335
I'll close my eyes.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.707
Okay, open them.

18:53.686 --> 18:55.149
Gasp.

18:56.871 --> 18:58.328
Oh...

18:59.264 --> 19:01.231
Oh...

19:04.052 --> 19:06.047
This is so beautiful.

19:06.469 --> 19:08.009
I spent all night trying to set it up

19:08.034 --> 19:10.672
and make sure it was facing
the right way and everything.

19:11.113 --> 19:13.047
I wanted to make sure
everything in our universe

19:13.072 --> 19:15.266
was exactly where it should be.

19:19.445 --> 19:21.680
It means so much to
me that you did this.

19:23.125 --> 19:24.852
It was fun.

19:25.228 --> 19:27.195
And I know which one the North Star is,

19:27.220 --> 19:29.774
so I can always find my way back home...

19:32.703 --> 19:34.369
to you.

19:36.029 --> 19:37.477
Oh, Josh.

19:38.698 --> 19:40.188
Wait, is kissing allowed?

19:42.100 --> 19:44.100
Ah...

20:36.446 --> 20:38.652
_

20:41.198 --> 20:42.723
Does anyone know anything?

20:42.835 --> 20:44.368
I got to know how that date went.

20:44.393 --> 20:46.226
I lost my mind yesterday
and put $600 on Greg.

20:46.338 --> 20:48.138
Oh, what?

20:48.618 --> 20:50.764
Guys, the next-door neighbor called.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.711
I told him we were
dying for info and that

20:52.735 --> 20:54.101
I would cut him in on my winnings,

20:54.169 --> 20:55.702
so he peeked over the fence for me.

20:55.771 --> 20:56.870
- And?
- And? - And?

20:56.939 --> 20:57.939
- And?
- And?

20:58.051 --> 21:00.284
And he said he saw them

21:00.309 --> 21:01.575
waking up in each other's arms

21:01.644 --> 21:02.843
through a very tiny

21:02.911 --> 21:04.745
window in a tent.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.881
Oh, wait. I'm getting a text.

21:07.993 --> 21:09.159
It's from Rebecca.

21:13.267 --> 21:14.834
- Dots.
- Okay.

21:14.859 --> 21:16.735
Oh, oh, no, no. Oh, no. She says...

21:16.884 --> 21:19.837
- What'd she say?
- "It was perfect."

21:19.862 --> 21:21.695
No!

21:21.764 --> 21:25.265
- Oh, yes!
- Josh Chan is in the lead, folks!

21:27.703 --> 21:30.103
Oh, come on!

21:30.128 --> 21:32.295
Slay. Slay, slay, slay.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.126
- Slay. - Mm-hmm. I need to figure out
how to pay for this whole thing.

21:35.151 --> 21:38.071
- Mama Cookie knows, girl. Mama Cookie
always knows. Ha! - It's very expensive.

21:39.634 --> 21:41.820
So, you're talking about
federal administrative

21:41.845 --> 21:44.609
and regulatory law and
you're not citing Elena Kagan,

21:44.634 --> 21:47.359
what are you doing?

21:49.877 --> 21:51.298
Are we sure this is gonna work?

21:51.323 --> 21:52.722
You said I needed to do something

21:52.747 --> 21:55.081
to get into this contest,
so this is what I'm doing.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.839
Winning over Rebecca's best friend.

21:56.864 --> 21:58.464
If you put as much effort into the date

21:58.489 --> 22:00.489
as you put into poaching 60 fillets...

22:00.514 --> 22:02.080
You don't understand.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.003
I can't plan romantic things.

22:04.028 --> 22:05.828
I'm terrible at contrived stuff.

22:05.853 --> 22:07.386
I can't even sing "Happy Birthday."

22:07.411 --> 22:10.753
Other people sing it and I go,
"Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah"

22:10.778 --> 22:12.478
because I find it so embarrassing.

22:12.547 --> 22:13.792
So, I can't do that.

22:13.817 --> 22:16.117
So this is what I have, okay? Fish!

22:17.552 --> 22:19.282
Oh... what?

22:19.307 --> 22:21.140
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:22.251 --> 22:25.390
Would you normal people
excuse me for just one second?

22:25.415 --> 22:27.382
Okay. Thanks.

22:30.012 --> 22:31.945
Uh, what's this?

22:31.970 --> 22:33.599
A lightly poached coho

22:33.624 --> 22:35.024
with a dill reduction for five dozen

22:35.049 --> 22:38.948
or, one would say, salmon for 60. Hi.

22:38.973 --> 22:41.073
I'm Greg Serrano, let's
try again, shall we?

22:41.142 --> 22:43.376
Uh... I'm about to step
into a meeting, Greg.

22:43.401 --> 22:45.646
Yes, yes, I understand and I'll
totally get out of your hair.

22:45.671 --> 22:47.738
I just wanted to save
the day for a working mom

22:47.763 --> 22:49.140
so you don't disappoint your son again.

22:49.250 --> 22:50.493
Oh, dear.

22:50.518 --> 22:51.951
Oh.

22:51.976 --> 22:55.008
So you're an expert on parenting now?

22:55.033 --> 22:57.033
No, I just... I didn't
mean to criticize.

22:57.058 --> 22:58.704
That came out wrong.

23:02.564 --> 23:04.642
Oh.

23:04.997 --> 23:07.531
I know what this is.

23:07.556 --> 23:09.245
You overheard me having a problem,

23:09.270 --> 23:10.836
so you thought you'd swoop in and help,

23:10.861 --> 23:12.261
get in my good graces,

23:12.286 --> 23:14.753
so I'll put in a word in with Rebecca.

23:14.909 --> 23:16.309
Oh, she's good. You're good, Paula.

23:16.377 --> 23:17.410
She's very good.

23:17.435 --> 23:18.668
- Greg.
- Hmm?

23:18.693 --> 23:20.923
Rebecca makes her own choices.

23:21.683 --> 23:23.516
But I gotta say...

23:23.629 --> 23:25.061
- Uh-huh?
- You have a lot

23:25.086 --> 23:28.421
of tough competition, so I really hope

23:28.446 --> 23:32.268
that you have a better
plan than bringing me fish.

23:32.293 --> 23:33.693
Yes. Yes, ma'am, I do.

23:33.761 --> 23:35.394
Y-Yes, yes, ma'am. He does.

23:35.463 --> 23:37.396
Great. Then you're all set.

23:37.696 --> 23:40.543
I mean, you know, after
you stop by my house

23:40.568 --> 23:42.335
and put that salmon in the fridge.

23:42.403 --> 23:44.775
Key's under the mat. Thanks.

23:55.283 --> 23:56.556
Wow.

23:57.423 --> 23:59.585
You look so beautiful.

23:59.888 --> 24:01.634
I'm sorry.

24:02.634 --> 24:05.101
This is kind of weird.

24:05.126 --> 24:06.592
No, it's okay.

24:06.705 --> 24:08.605
You and Nathaniel have a good time.

24:08.630 --> 24:09.929
Well...

24:09.954 --> 24:11.420
an okay time.

24:11.445 --> 24:12.912
A fine time.

24:13.101 --> 24:14.300
Ugh.

24:14.325 --> 24:15.724
Who am I kidding?

24:15.749 --> 24:18.032
I've been praying all day
for the San Andreas Fault

24:18.057 --> 24:20.207
to open up and s-swallow up Nathaniel.

24:20.408 --> 24:22.126
And then Greg.

24:22.687 --> 24:24.687
And then Josh Chan from Azusa,

24:24.712 --> 24:26.979
who continues to mess
with my credit rating.

24:27.092 --> 24:28.992
Josh, I know this is hard.

24:29.017 --> 24:30.118
I...

24:30.662 --> 24:32.462
We had such a good time the other night.

24:32.853 --> 24:33.986
But...

24:34.099 --> 24:36.366
Is this what we're doing?

24:36.391 --> 24:38.157
You know, I don't know what else to do.

24:38.182 --> 24:39.615
Yeah, I-I know.

24:41.466 --> 24:43.699
I thought this would be
simple, but...

24:45.750 --> 24:47.116
It's not.

24:48.403 --> 24:50.403
Okay, I'll see you later.

25:03.117 --> 25:05.056
Nathaniel, where are we going?

25:05.611 --> 25:07.077
Here, come on.

25:08.387 --> 25:10.420
Oh.

25:10.696 --> 25:11.957
Oh, my God.

25:11.982 --> 25:13.782
Oh, my God.

25:13.895 --> 25:17.963
This is just so beautiful,
and it's so thoughtful.

25:20.212 --> 25:22.345
But what's wrong? Are you okay?

25:22.370 --> 25:24.070
No, I'm fine, it's just...

25:24.182 --> 25:25.548
I don't know what's happening.

25:25.573 --> 25:28.107
This is just so...

25:28.176 --> 25:29.575
And you guys are so...

25:29.644 --> 25:30.844
I know, it's weird. It's weird.

25:30.878 --> 25:32.712
- You were just on a date with Josh...
- Yes.

25:32.780 --> 25:34.980
And now you're here with
me, and I bought...

25:35.005 --> 25:36.726
a bunch of cheese and crackers,

25:36.751 --> 25:38.429
so many different types of crackers.

25:38.453 --> 25:39.852
I don't know why.

25:39.921 --> 25:41.454
Why don't... why don't we just...

25:41.479 --> 25:43.633
just forget everything else

25:43.658 --> 25:45.658
and just try to enjoy this?

25:45.683 --> 25:46.767
You know?

25:47.474 --> 25:49.440
Okay.

25:51.032 --> 25:52.465
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

25:52.818 --> 25:54.018
- Yeah.
- Here, sit down.

25:54.050 --> 25:55.850
Okay.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.006
Oh. Wow.

26:01.031 --> 26:02.540
This is just...

26:03.010 --> 26:04.876
it's the most beautiful view.

26:04.901 --> 26:08.001
You know, on a clear day,
you can see Gardena, Torrance,

26:08.026 --> 26:09.225
and if you squint,

26:09.250 --> 26:11.617
the Rancho Dominguez Cineplex 23.

26:11.729 --> 26:14.630
I do love that place.
They have so many movies.

26:14.655 --> 26:15.821
- Almost two dozen.
- Right...

26:15.934 --> 26:17.467
You know what I mean.

26:17.492 --> 26:18.758
Not quite, but almost.

26:18.783 --> 26:20.970
- Not quite, just short.
- Just shy.

26:24.162 --> 26:25.895
What is that?

26:26.268 --> 26:27.434
Oh.

26:28.970 --> 26:30.736
- There it is.
- What?

26:30.805 --> 26:32.738
- You know what you did.
- Oh, yeah?

26:32.807 --> 26:34.774
You hired a band. I
knew you'd play dirty

26:34.842 --> 26:36.041
and spend all your money.

26:36.110 --> 26:37.510
- I knew you would. I knew it.
- No, I...

26:37.545 --> 26:39.456
I did no such thing. I
played by the rules. Uh-huh.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.880
- Sure. Uh-huh.
- I did. No, no.

26:40.940 --> 26:45.294
What I did do was, I found
the perfect spot to sit

26:45.319 --> 26:46.585
right above the Greek Theater

26:46.610 --> 26:48.618
and listen to a concert for free.

26:49.353 --> 26:52.545
Tonight is "The
Greatest Hits of Broadway

26:52.570 --> 26:53.936
with Michael Bublé."

26:59.700 --> 27:01.743
Huh. I wonder what...

27:02.009 --> 27:04.203
Broadway standard this
is. I don't recognize it.

27:04.272 --> 27:05.516
Maybe it's from Starlight Express

27:05.540 --> 27:07.139
or Once on This Island. I don't know.

27:07.164 --> 27:10.132
Those are the two shows
I know the least. Hang on.

27:10.244 --> 27:11.477
Oh.

27:11.590 --> 27:14.680
No, I screwed this up.

27:14.705 --> 27:16.605
It's not Broadway's
greatest hits; it's...

27:16.761 --> 27:19.395
"'70s Groove Night with Marty Macaroon

27:19.420 --> 27:21.320
and the Funky Town Eight."

27:21.345 --> 27:22.353
Wow.

27:22.723 --> 27:24.490
This is a disaster. I'm...

27:24.515 --> 27:26.782
I'm so sorry. This is awful.

27:29.243 --> 27:30.863
- Hold on.
- No, no.

27:30.888 --> 27:33.355
I actually kind of like it.

27:33.546 --> 27:36.179
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I wouldn't humor you.

27:36.204 --> 27:37.204
No one likes this.

27:37.238 --> 27:38.518
Marty Macaroon doesn't like this.

27:38.543 --> 27:41.210
I'm gonna like anyone
with the name Macaroon.

27:41.353 --> 27:43.219
Shall we dance?

27:43.244 --> 27:44.398
To this? Come on.

27:44.423 --> 27:46.002
Yeah. Let's dance.
Dance with me. Come on.

27:46.003 --> 27:47.289
Oh, you want to stand up and dance.

27:47.314 --> 27:48.826
Oh, my gosh. Stand up and dance with me.

27:48.850 --> 27:50.816
- All right.
- Try and salvage this.

27:50.885 --> 27:53.319
Feel the Macaroon rhythm.

27:53.344 --> 27:55.878
- There we go.
- Ooh. I mean, that bass line is crunchy.

27:55.990 --> 27:57.556
- It is so crunchy.
- It's a crunchy bass.

27:57.581 --> 27:59.681
- Ooh, let's bite our lower lips.
- What does that do?

27:59.794 --> 28:00.860
I think this is how...

28:00.928 --> 28:02.194
It's just the funk face, right?

28:08.236 --> 28:10.369
- Nice.
- Okay. Oh.

28:10.438 --> 28:13.681
- And back. Oh, drop the beat, Marty.
- Yeah, Marty!

28:20.685 --> 28:21.984
Then I'll pull you in.

28:32.173 --> 28:34.440
I don't want to give
you a whole big pitch.

28:34.465 --> 28:36.269
I've done that so many times before.

28:39.072 --> 28:40.471
But I think...

28:41.564 --> 28:42.963
we're meant to be together.

28:45.798 --> 28:47.354
And if you pick me,

28:48.089 --> 28:51.458
it'll be because you feel the same way.

29:01.035 --> 29:02.087
I thought so.

29:27.106 --> 29:29.894
So, where did Rebecca and
Nathaniel go for their date?

29:30.053 --> 29:31.752
Probably somewhere boring.

29:31.973 --> 29:34.240
If it was me, I would've
taken Rebecca to see

29:34.265 --> 29:36.636
Marty Macaroon and the Funky Town Eight.

29:36.661 --> 29:38.695
You're a Macarooner? Oh!

29:38.720 --> 29:40.587
We should swap cassettes.

29:40.699 --> 29:42.676
Yeah, I've got April '93 at Red Rocks.

29:42.701 --> 29:44.467
- No!
- Mm-hmm.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.258
- The drone images are in.
- What?

29:46.415 --> 29:48.348
I got a buddy to follow Nathaniel

29:48.373 --> 29:49.806
and toss up a drone. No biggie.

29:54.212 --> 29:55.645
Okay.

29:55.758 --> 29:57.724
What?!

29:59.684 --> 30:01.751
Oh, got a text. Wow.

30:01.864 --> 30:03.196
It says...

30:03.221 --> 30:05.488
"It was heaven."

30:05.557 --> 30:06.856
- Yes. Yes!
- Yeah!

30:06.925 --> 30:08.445
Papa's got a winner.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.170
And mama's got a winner!

30:10.195 --> 30:11.806
Oh, wait, my thing
sounded like your thing.

30:11.830 --> 30:12.896
Mm, just a little bit.

30:28.722 --> 30:29.879
Hi.

30:30.097 --> 30:31.625
Well, hello, sir.

30:31.650 --> 30:33.550
I'm Bernie. Looking for a little...

30:33.801 --> 30:36.162
- high-altitude romance?
- Oh.

30:36.187 --> 30:38.555
Wow, we're going with that
tone right out of the gate.

30:38.666 --> 30:40.800
Okay, uh, yeah. Well,
here's what I'm looking for...

30:40.825 --> 30:42.392
something romantic.

30:42.504 --> 30:43.870
No irony involved.

30:43.895 --> 30:46.596
Just the thing that people do
that is the thing people do.

30:47.051 --> 30:49.832
I love a girl and need
to show her how much.

30:49.857 --> 30:53.513
Ah, our standard $50 package. Got it.

30:53.582 --> 30:56.383
Our magical journey begins

30:56.582 --> 30:58.452
with your choice of pattern
for your hot-air balloon:

30:58.476 --> 31:01.110
rainbow, carnival stripes, polka dots.

31:01.223 --> 31:02.656
You know what?

31:02.724 --> 31:04.357
Let's do it. For once in my life,

31:04.382 --> 31:05.748
I got to really go all out.

31:05.817 --> 31:07.584
Great! Done.

31:07.933 --> 31:09.660
Oh. Oh, cool, that's it?

31:10.691 --> 31:13.656
I-I thought you were gonna give
me more of a song and dance.

31:13.725 --> 31:15.345
From me? No, no, no, never.

31:15.370 --> 31:16.736
Okay.

31:17.465 --> 31:20.196
Well, Th-there is one
other thing. It's...

31:20.309 --> 31:21.875
J-Just a word of warning.

31:21.900 --> 31:23.266
Warning?

happened a couple times,

31:55.500 --> 31:58.701
and, uh, it's a nightmare. Ugh.

31:58.911 --> 32:01.011
Very hard to get poop out of wicker.

32:09.176 --> 32:10.446
Cool tux.

32:10.515 --> 32:12.415
Yeah, came with the rainbow package.

32:12.484 --> 32:14.617
- Not gonna even show you my socks.
- Wow.

32:14.686 --> 32:17.320
You know what? I'm impressed. Yeah?

32:17.543 --> 32:20.533
I mean, you hate this
stuff, and you're doing it.

32:20.601 --> 32:21.701
Feeling good?

32:21.726 --> 32:24.927
Uh, I don't know. I have no idea.

32:24.952 --> 32:27.207
I mean, I used to feel so confident

32:27.232 --> 32:28.972
about Rebecca, and now...

32:29.136 --> 32:31.378
This week, I've just been
steaming a whole bunch of fish

32:31.403 --> 32:33.636
and agreeing to sail
over the Temecula Valley

32:33.661 --> 32:35.015
in a stripy balloon.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.472
Are you having second thoughts?

32:36.793 --> 32:39.619
Yeah, yeah, I'm having second thoughts,

32:39.941 --> 32:42.275
but still gonna do it.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.793
Is this bow tie straight?

32:47.083 --> 32:48.379
I doubt it.

32:57.795 --> 32:59.561
Oh, come on.

32:59.586 --> 33:03.830
Oh, Dr. Akopian? What are...
What? You go to this wine bar?

33:03.855 --> 33:05.090
Okay, look.

33:05.521 --> 33:07.446
Yeah, I'm stalking you
again. We've established this.

33:07.471 --> 33:08.682
It's a very problematic behavior,

33:08.706 --> 33:10.906
and we should discuss it
the next time I'm in therapy,

33:10.975 --> 33:12.141
but listen, I need some help.

33:12.209 --> 33:14.243
Okay, these dates aren't
clarifying anything.

33:14.311 --> 33:16.189
They're just... they're
fogging up all my windows...

33:16.213 --> 33:18.253
My front window, my back
window and my side windows.

33:18.278 --> 33:20.629
And I don't know what to do.
Can I have a sip of your wine?

33:20.670 --> 33:23.104
- Oh, no.
- No, that-that's not appropriate.

33:24.722 --> 33:27.189
I don't know how I'm gonna
face this Greg date coming up.

33:27.214 --> 33:28.400
It's gonna ruin my life.

33:28.425 --> 33:31.293
I cannot go on yet another

33:31.318 --> 33:33.426
romantic and perfect date.

33:33.451 --> 33:35.251
Then don't.

33:35.276 --> 33:38.343
Just follow what's in your heart.

33:39.222 --> 33:40.707
Follow what's in my heart?

33:40.732 --> 33:43.038
What kind of therapist advice is that?

33:43.063 --> 33:45.630
Look, I-I'm-I'm just trying
to have a glass of wine.

33:45.655 --> 33:47.933
I am not on the clock
right now, okay, Rebecca?

33:48.251 --> 33:50.819
Okay, that's fair. You're
right. Self-care is important.

33:51.535 --> 33:53.501
Thanks for not dropping me as a patient.

33:53.526 --> 33:55.526
See you at 4:00 tomorrow.

33:59.709 --> 34:01.027
Help.

Wow. So, what's, um...

35:13.742 --> 35:15.287
What's happening here?

35:15.664 --> 35:17.433
Well, in order of importance,

35:17.458 --> 35:19.375
I'm wearing a real uncomfortable tuxedo,

35:19.400 --> 35:22.668
I possibly just split my pants,
and my crappy car won't start.

35:23.007 --> 35:24.273
How about you?

35:24.790 --> 35:26.406
About the same.

35:28.002 --> 35:29.902
- Let's get you to the shop.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.127
Yeah.

35:46.508 --> 35:49.188
- Oh, my God, no one ate the salmon.
- Oh.

35:49.300 --> 35:51.990
- They never do.
- Then why do we do this?

35:52.059 --> 35:54.793
Paula, that's how it's always been.

35:55.274 --> 35:57.807
Oh... Louise,

35:57.832 --> 36:00.881
this whole process needs a redo.

36:00.906 --> 36:02.601
We should be working together.

36:02.713 --> 36:05.280
I mean, no sign-up
sheets, no competition;

36:05.305 --> 36:08.540
just-just a community
of moms collaborating.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.752
Oh, God.

36:15.063 --> 36:17.560
Oh-oh-oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

36:17.585 --> 36:18.917
Guys, guys, guys, stop.

36:18.986 --> 36:21.220
Stop, stop, everybody,
stop what you're doing.

36:21.288 --> 36:25.478
Bernie called. They never
showed up for their balloon ride.

36:25.503 --> 36:27.203
- What? What?
- No, no.

36:27.228 --> 36:29.962
No, Hector, you put his bow tie
on him. You said he was going.

36:30.030 --> 36:31.608
Well, he was, but he
seemed a little wigged out

36:31.632 --> 36:33.243
- about the whole thing, honestly.
- Why didn't you tell us that?

36:33.267 --> 36:35.444
Oh, God, I bet my
rowing machine on Greg.

36:35.469 --> 36:37.913
Oh, my God, what's going on?
We don't know what's going on.

36:37.938 --> 36:39.015
If they don't complete their date,

36:39.039 --> 36:41.006
it's a push. Nobody loses,

36:41.075 --> 36:43.008
- nobody wins.
- No!

36:43.077 --> 36:44.877
What? No!

36:55.024 --> 36:57.233
Hey. What are you doing here?

36:57.258 --> 36:59.444
Oh, well, I can't
drink over at Home Base.

36:59.469 --> 37:00.936
Not with all that betting going on.

37:00.961 --> 37:02.361
Oh, you heard about that, too?

37:02.473 --> 37:05.708
Yeah, of course. Think I wasn't
gonna put $1,000 on myself?

37:09.531 --> 37:10.813
Well, how was your date?

37:11.344 --> 37:13.238
Honestly? Really good.

37:13.688 --> 37:15.017
Yours?

37:15.456 --> 37:17.222
Oh, couldn't have gone any better.

37:20.147 --> 37:22.281
Well, we'll find out soon enough.

37:22.349 --> 37:23.703
Yeah.

37:24.395 --> 37:27.730
Hey, whatever happens, good game, man.

37:28.952 --> 37:30.052
Same.

37:32.711 --> 37:35.294
- Cheers.
- Yeah, cheers.

37:39.667 --> 37:41.033
God, I hope I win, though.

37:41.145 --> 37:42.645
I really hope you lose.

37:43.180 --> 37:45.270
I also hope Greg dies.

37:45.339 --> 37:47.439
Ooh, were you thinking
San Andreas Fault?

37:47.464 --> 37:48.808
I was actually thinking lightning bolt.

37:48.876 --> 37:50.389
It's quick, it's painless. Mm.

37:50.414 --> 37:51.720
You know, I do like the guy.

37:51.745 --> 37:53.078
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

38:11.196 --> 38:14.330
Well, it's gonna take
a long time to fix it.

38:14.399 --> 38:17.367
Something about the
trans... carburetor...

38:17.727 --> 38:19.813
I'm being lied to, and it's
gonna be very expensive.

38:19.838 --> 38:21.805
And our date's already ruined

38:21.873 --> 38:23.740
because we're gonna miss our start time

38:23.765 --> 38:25.698
for our takeoff, so...

38:25.855 --> 38:27.654
Uh, takeoff?

38:27.722 --> 38:30.323
It's a long story. Never mind.

38:30.348 --> 38:33.750
Just... Hey, can I be honest with you?

38:33.819 --> 38:34.918
Yeah.

38:34.986 --> 38:36.686
I've been dreading this whole thing.

38:36.755 --> 38:38.321
Not being with you. That part I love.

38:38.390 --> 38:42.559
Just the date I had
planned, it's so not me.

38:42.758 --> 38:46.506
It's so very Bernie. Weird guy.

38:46.531 --> 38:49.866
- Who's...
- The bow tie.

38:49.935 --> 38:51.768
- Oh, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

38:51.837 --> 38:54.637
I got to tell you something.
When I ran into you,

38:54.705 --> 38:56.349
I was literally seconds
away from texting you

38:56.374 --> 38:57.474
and canceling the date.

38:57.542 --> 38:59.742
Not because I don't like
spending time with you,

38:59.767 --> 39:02.222
but I just... All these dates,

39:02.247 --> 39:04.414
it's just so exhausting,
it's so much pressure.

39:04.483 --> 39:05.563
Right.

39:05.724 --> 39:08.524
So... this date is off?

39:10.998 --> 39:12.633
Looks like it.

39:13.735 --> 39:15.635
Oh, thank God.

39:18.753 --> 39:20.419
Oh...

39:21.024 --> 39:22.732
Well, if you're gonna be
here for the next few hours,

39:22.801 --> 39:23.967
I'll just wait with you.

39:24.035 --> 39:25.502
Really? You would do that?

39:25.570 --> 39:27.036
Yeah. I got nothing to do.

39:27.105 --> 39:28.867
I just found out my date canceled.

39:30.805 --> 39:32.495
Hey, so, uh, did you eat yet?

39:32.520 --> 39:34.399
No, I was waiting for you
to eat, but I would eat now.

39:34.424 --> 39:35.624
Do you want to go somewhere?

39:35.728 --> 39:36.928
Uh, I more feel like ordering.

39:36.953 --> 39:37.946
Ooh, I would do that.

39:37.971 --> 39:40.039
Yeah? What do you want?
What are you in the mood for?

39:40.989 --> 39:43.389
Um, Italian?

39:43.571 --> 39:45.135
I have that all the time at work.

39:45.204 --> 39:47.104
- Right, of course. Yeah.
- What about Thai?

39:47.485 --> 39:49.016
I had that for lunch,
but any other place.

39:49.041 --> 39:50.140
Really, you pick.

39:50.209 --> 39:51.709
Okay, well, I picked last time.

39:51.777 --> 39:54.912
Oh, you did, and we went to
that Indian place, which I loved.

39:54.980 --> 39:57.247
Mm-hmm. Do you want to do that again?

39:57.272 --> 39:59.673
No, you know what I want?
I want that new taco place.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.738
- The one on East Cameron? I
heard that's amazing. - Yes.

40:01.763 --> 40:02.929
- Right? It's...
- Okay. Okay.

40:02.954 --> 40:04.954
- So I-I want to see if they deliver.
- Yeah, sure.

40:04.979 --> 40:07.546
I'll pull up the menu.

40:07.726 --> 40:10.193
Let's see.

40:10.218 --> 40:11.618
Okay, I'm gonna pull up the menu.

40:11.831 --> 40:14.098
You have to decide what you
want beforehand because, no,

40:14.123 --> 40:15.956
I cannot be on the phone and have you

40:15.981 --> 40:17.181
shouting your order in my ear.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.206
It's not my fault that
I realize what I want

40:19.231 --> 40:20.442
when I hear what you're getting.

40:20.467 --> 40:21.678
I understand it's not your fault,

40:21.703 --> 40:23.736
but it's very irritating
and very annoying,

40:23.761 --> 40:25.360
and we've had many discussions about it,

40:25.493 --> 40:28.027
so just make a... Here
you go, here's the menu.

40:30.216 --> 40:32.039
Do I like chilaquiles?

40:32.791 --> 40:34.424
Yeah, of course you do, with the Verde.

40:34.449 --> 40:35.729
Right, right, right, right, yes.

40:35.921 --> 40:37.287
Okay, I want to get that.

40:37.312 --> 40:38.812
Okay.

40:44.340 --> 40:46.306
Hey.

40:46.331 --> 40:48.383
You're the love of my life.

40:49.429 --> 40:51.495
You know that, right?

40:54.782 --> 40:56.782
Well, I do now.
