WEBVTT

00:02.394 --> 00:03.894
(groans) I'm never
gonna be able to find

00:03.987 --> 00:05.395
an apartment I can afford.

00:05.414 --> 00:06.672
Well, I can't say
I'm rooting for you to leave.

00:06.823 --> 00:09.174
I mean, who else am I gonna make
meatless paella for

00:09.326 --> 00:10.567
on Meatless Paella Monday?

00:10.660 --> 00:13.495
The names of these places are
so misleading.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.390
Magnolia Terrace.
Blue Springs Vista.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.408
They should call them
Small, Hot Caves

00:18.502 --> 00:20.686
and No Natural Light,
Cockroach Dump Truck.

00:20.913 --> 00:23.764
You know, cockroaches are
really misunderstood.

00:23.916 --> 00:25.916
They're actually
evolutionary miracles.

00:26.009 --> 00:27.693
Okay, then you move there.

00:29.088 --> 00:30.512
Hello.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.681
This place could be called:
Mom-Barges-In Estates,

00:33.776 --> 00:36.260
fully furnished with stuff
she'll criticize.

00:36.278 --> 00:38.370
What is that awful smell?

00:38.597 --> 00:39.854
Dinner.

00:39.932 --> 00:41.948
Oh, yum.

00:42.101 --> 00:43.858
Oh, looks like someone's
been shopping.

00:43.952 --> 00:45.878
Well, Preston and I are going
on vacation,

00:46.029 --> 00:48.196
and I needed some new things.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.049
What do you think?

00:50.276 --> 00:52.534
Are you going to Miami
in the '80s?

00:53.295 --> 00:55.703
You're getting too comfortable
with me.

00:55.798 --> 00:58.131
And we're going to Bora Bora.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.543
Yeah, I bet it won't be
"Bora Boring." (chuckles)

01:01.711 --> 01:04.712
Maybe I could live
in this windowless basement.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.475
While I'm gone, I was hoping
you could stop by the house

01:08.627 --> 01:10.218
each evening
to pick up the mail

01:10.312 --> 01:12.404
and turn on some lights
so it looks like someone's home.

01:12.556 --> 01:15.132
And then go back in the morning
and turn them off again?

01:15.225 --> 01:17.058
Oh, could you?
You're such a dear.

01:17.894 --> 01:19.227
Sheila, you know you can
get the lights

01:19.396 --> 01:20.987
that turn off and on
by themselves.

01:21.140 --> 01:23.490
Yeah, I've got mine set to go on
every day at dusk.

01:23.642 --> 01:24.825
Sounds like witchcraft.

01:25.144 --> 01:28.979
You can also control them
with the sound of your voice.

01:29.148 --> 01:30.831
Alexa, turn on party lights.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.674
<i> ALEXA:</i>
<i> Okay.</i>

01:33.819 --> 01:34.760
(Sheila gasps)

01:34.911 --> 01:36.503
Oh, it gets better.

01:36.655 --> 01:38.488
Alexa, play dance music.

01:39.491 --> 01:41.675

I can't understand why someone
who lifts heavy packages

02:08.354 --> 02:11.037
for a living, would go
to the gym on his day off.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.614
Max invited me.

02:12.691 --> 02:14.115
Oh.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.284
So you two really<i> are</i> friends.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.469
And it's all because of me?

02:17.696 --> 02:19.787
I should pat myself on the back
for that.

02:19.882 --> 02:22.975
Ooh, I should do this more.
I really like it.

02:23.793 --> 02:24.868
I'm looking forward to it.

02:24.887 --> 02:26.127
Max belongs to
a really cool gym,

02:26.147 --> 02:27.795
and it's a chance to bro out.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.872
Bro out?

02:28.965 --> 02:30.298
You know, spend time
with other guys

02:30.317 --> 02:31.483
but while doing
something physical

02:31.710 --> 02:33.043
so you don't have to talk
to each other.

02:33.061 --> 02:35.061
I've been told I talk too much.

02:35.214 --> 02:36.804
Especially during...

02:36.824 --> 02:40.308
Well, it's early.
We don't need to go into detail.

02:40.402 --> 02:43.162
I suspect this is about more
than bro-ing out.

02:43.313 --> 02:44.663
You want to show off,
don't you?

02:44.740 --> 02:46.390
So much.
I really bulked up

02:46.408 --> 02:49.168
since everyone started ordering
those online mattresses.

02:49.319 --> 02:51.244
Really? I haven't noticed.

02:51.397 --> 02:53.655
(quietly):
I have totally noticed.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.248
Wow.

02:55.401 --> 02:56.917
-I'll call you later.
-All right.

02:57.069 --> 03:00.495
Have fun, uh, pumping or lifting
or whatever you're gonna do.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.407
-Hey, Randi.
-Hey, Oscar, looking good.

03:03.425 --> 03:06.243
Keep ordering those mattresses,
folks.

03:06.336 --> 03:08.929
So, how'd it go?
Did you like the apartment?

03:09.023 --> 03:10.747
There was a toilet
in the kitchen.

03:10.766 --> 03:14.267
-Ooh.
-But, Kat, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.177
On my way back,
I was sitting at a red light

03:16.197 --> 03:17.512
and I saw
your mother's boyfriend

03:17.531 --> 03:18.772
walk out of a restaurant

03:18.924 --> 03:19.923
with another woman.

03:19.942 --> 03:21.425
What?

03:21.443 --> 03:23.035
Yeah, and they were really
into each other.

03:23.262 --> 03:24.352
Definitely vibing.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.537
How'd you even know
it was Preston?

03:25.764 --> 03:26.930
You've never met him.

03:26.949 --> 03:28.782
Well, he's all over
Sheila's Instagram.

03:28.934 --> 03:30.767
My mother has Instagram?

03:30.860 --> 03:31.785
And TikTok.

03:31.937 --> 03:33.378
Although,
somethings it's unclear

03:33.530 --> 03:36.715
if she understands
that her videos can be seen

03:36.866 --> 03:38.133
by everybody.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.444
Kat, I'm sure it was him.

03:40.462 --> 03:42.462
And I'm sure it was
completely innocent.

03:42.614 --> 03:44.706
I hang out with Max,
and I'm not cheating on Oscar.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.726
Oh, I hate to break it to you,
but people think you are.

03:47.877 --> 03:49.210
Costumers talk about it
all the time.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.396
Yeah, I stopped trying
to correct them

03:51.623 --> 03:52.806
and started joining in.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.460
You're making fun of me, but
you're only proving my point.

03:56.553 --> 03:59.220
Poor Sheila. How're you
gonna break it to her?

03:59.314 --> 04:00.480
I'm not.

04:00.632 --> 04:03.133
All we have is something
Randi thinks she saw.

04:03.302 --> 04:06.245
If I were gonna tell my mother,
I would need concrete evidence.

04:06.396 --> 04:07.412
Well, then, let's go get some.

04:07.564 --> 04:08.580
What do you mean, like, spy?

04:08.732 --> 04:10.898
Yes. We can get in my car
and follow him.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.493
Oh, I don't know if I feel
comfortable spying on Preston.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.588
I-I can't even watch
a cat licking itself.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.573
All right, then don't.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.241
Just put it
in the back of your mind,

04:20.319 --> 04:22.761
where it gnaws at you
day and night.

04:22.912 --> 04:24.680
Night and day.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.081
Fine. We'll spy.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.434
Oh! I love this!

04:29.661 --> 04:33.438
It's like watching an episode
of<i> CSI: Louisville.</i>

04:36.168 --> 04:38.593
(straining)

04:38.687 --> 04:40.279
-Yeah!
-(shouts)

04:40.430 --> 04:42.447
-(both laugh)
-Hey, man, crushed it.

04:42.599 --> 04:43.765
-Boom.
-Your turn.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.191
-All right. I got to match that.
-All right.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.343
Yeah.

04:46.361 --> 04:48.954
-What's up?
-Ah, saved by the Oscar.

04:49.105 --> 04:52.457
-I didn't know you belonged
to this gym.
-I don't. Max invited me.

04:52.609 --> 04:53.775
Oh, okay. Cool, cool.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.685
I figured
the more, the sweatier.

04:55.704 --> 04:57.704
Mind if I give this a try?

04:57.798 --> 04:58.705
You warmed up?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.023
I'm always warm.

05:00.042 --> 05:01.633
That's a weird flex, but okay.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.168
It took me weeks
to get this weight.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.803
If you want to, you-- Oh.

05:04.954 --> 05:07.864
(laughs):
Oh! Dude.

05:07.883 --> 05:09.290
Mattresses.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.643
That's another weird flex.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.203
I really, uh, like this gym.

05:13.221 --> 05:14.962
Yeah, they got a cardio room,
they got a pool.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.815
Right, right, but the, uh,
the weight room

05:16.966 --> 05:19.151
is kind of our domain.

05:19.378 --> 05:21.227
I notice they offer
yoga classes.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.879
You guys want to try that
next time?

05:22.898 --> 05:24.323
That'd be cool. I'm in.

05:24.474 --> 05:25.382
You're in?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.641
Great, we can drive over
together.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.160
Wait, wait, uh,
what about weight lifting?

05:28.311 --> 05:30.220
What about our domain?

05:30.238 --> 05:32.906
(laughs) We'll have
two domains, you know?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.224
Let's expand the kingdom.

05:34.242 --> 05:35.334
Have you ever done yoga before?

05:35.561 --> 05:37.727
(laughs):
Have I done yoga?

05:37.821 --> 05:39.245
No.

05:39.398 --> 05:41.006
I think you'll really like it.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.674
It's super athletic.
It takes, uh, strength,

05:42.901 --> 05:43.917
skill, flexibility.

05:44.069 --> 05:46.011
You've, um, already got
the whole package.

05:46.162 --> 05:48.213
Accurate.

05:48.365 --> 05:51.391
All right, let's get flexible.

05:52.427 --> 05:53.727
I stand by that.

05:55.581 --> 05:57.747
Okay, that's my mom's house
right over there.

05:57.766 --> 06:00.174
She's gonna be at bridge club
for the next four hours.

06:00.268 --> 06:02.268
Five if they make margaritas.

06:02.363 --> 06:05.105
Perfect time for
that dirty bastard to sneak out

06:05.199 --> 06:06.423
without her knowing.

06:06.441 --> 06:07.699
Okay, he's not
a dirty bastard yet.

06:07.851 --> 06:11.111
Your mom let this crusty old
dude move into her house

06:11.263 --> 06:12.445
and now he's got a side piece?

06:12.598 --> 06:15.615
That is my definition
of a dirty bastard.

06:15.784 --> 06:18.043
Again, I think we need to put
a pin in "dirty bastard"

06:18.194 --> 06:19.786
until we have proof.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.456
-All right, so we wait.
-Yes, and I have
waiting supplies.

06:23.625 --> 06:27.201
I've got chips and candy
and bubble gum

06:27.295 --> 06:28.795
for the bubble-blowing
competition--

06:28.947 --> 06:30.097
I'll explain later.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.874
Mad Libs. So fun.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.543
And I got a vegetarian
supreme pizza

06:35.562 --> 06:36.803
with extra mushrooms.

06:36.955 --> 06:38.546
I know you said
you love mushrooms.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.458
Actually, I said
I did mushrooms once.

06:41.551 --> 06:43.718
Got lost in the ball pit
at a kids' pizza place,

06:43.737 --> 06:45.570
but I appreciate the thought.

06:46.632 --> 06:47.480
Ooh, look,
Preston's getting in his car.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.983
Ooh, guess it's on
like<i> Donkey Kong.</i>

06:50.135 --> 06:52.661
Okay, no one says that anymore,
but I'll let you have this one.

06:54.656 --> 06:56.397
Uh, I need an adjective.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.999
Spacious.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.378
-Noun.
-Walk-in closet.

07:02.164 --> 07:03.422
Another noun?

07:03.573 --> 07:05.424
Underground parking.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.652
Boy, you really are stuck
on this apartment thing.

07:08.670 --> 07:11.263
I need a place of my own, Kat,
and I've looked everywhere.

07:11.490 --> 07:13.581
At this point, I'd be willing
to live in my car.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.842
You're currently sitting
in my guest bedroom.

07:15.994 --> 07:17.510
All right,
let's see where we are.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.922
Uh, "Even though the moon
first appears

07:20.941 --> 07:23.090
"as a spacious slice of light

07:23.185 --> 07:25.444
"and finally becomes
a full walk-in closet

07:25.595 --> 07:28.354
doesn't change
its underground parking."

07:28.507 --> 07:31.399
(laughs)
I mean, this game is brilliant.

07:32.194 --> 07:33.193
We've been following this guy

07:33.345 --> 07:34.511
for almost an hour.

07:34.604 --> 07:36.270
Basically we're just running
errands with him.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.014
Ah, are you saying
that maybe you were wrong?

07:38.033 --> 07:41.184
No, I'm saying if he's cheating,
then he's not doing it tonight.

07:41.203 --> 07:42.852
Okay, so let's call it.

07:42.913 --> 07:45.355
Or we pull over,

07:45.373 --> 07:47.207
eat the pizza
and play more Mad Libs.

07:47.359 --> 07:50.043
I won't tell you which one
I'm voting for.

07:50.195 --> 07:51.619
Ooh, wait, Preston's parking

07:51.713 --> 07:53.788
-in front of that
apartment building.
-Oh.

07:53.865 --> 07:56.808
Oh, he's getting out
with a bouquet of flowers.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.384
Wait, when did he get those?

07:58.479 --> 07:59.978
Maybe when he was
at the supermarket?

08:00.129 --> 08:01.538
We're not very good at this.

08:01.556 --> 08:04.040
We'd be better if you weren't
hitting me with Mad Libs

08:04.133 --> 08:05.525
while I'm trying to stalk.

08:11.233 --> 08:13.325
Ooh, look at Preston's swagger.

08:13.476 --> 08:14.308
Is he whistling?

08:14.328 --> 08:15.810
Ooh, I want to slap that whistle

08:15.829 --> 08:17.904
right off his cheating
cheetah lips.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.223
You know, maybe he's visiting
one of his kids.

08:20.242 --> 08:22.075
I think he has a son
who still lives in the area.

08:22.227 --> 08:23.243
Well, does his son have a thing

08:23.337 --> 08:25.395
for enormous bouquets
of red roses?

08:25.413 --> 08:27.080
He could be visiting
a-a sick friend.

08:27.232 --> 08:28.614
Or a sick aunt.

08:28.767 --> 08:31.067
Or maybe he's a member
of some underground

08:31.160 --> 08:32.677
flower-arranging club.

08:32.829 --> 08:35.347
Kat, I love your optimism,
but every once in a while,

08:35.498 --> 08:37.349
you need to see
the bad in people.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.517
I'm sorry, I just believe in

08:38.668 --> 08:40.001
giving people
the benefit of the doubt.

08:40.095 --> 08:41.502
It's a nicer way to live.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.504
Pretty sure it's why
I don't have wrinkles.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.339
Your skin is very good.

08:45.433 --> 08:46.674
Thank you.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.693
And so far, we don't have
evidence of anything

08:48.920 --> 08:50.270
other than Preston likes
to dip his fries

08:50.422 --> 08:51.679
in a milkshake while he drives.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.423
And I'm sure Sheila
would have something to say

08:53.425 --> 08:54.533
about fast food in the car.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.093
Oh, she certainly did
when I tried it in hers.

08:57.112 --> 08:58.278
Lost all my food privileges.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.280
I mean, I was 32 years old.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.458
I know how to eat in a car
without spilling.

09:06.362 --> 09:07.546
You know what?

09:07.697 --> 09:09.697
We're gonna have to take this
to the next level.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.033
I agree. What does that mean?

09:12.127 --> 09:14.944
Follow me. Bring the pizza.

09:14.946 --> 09:16.054
What about the Mad Libs?

09:16.205 --> 09:18.473
Let the damn Mad Libs go.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.376
Ah, class was awesome.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.545
I feel like I'm at least
an inch taller.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.399
Yeah, yoga's great for loosening
you up and stretching you out.

09:27.475 --> 09:29.401
I'll grab some beers.
Hey, you want some ice?

09:29.628 --> 09:31.236
You landed on your butt
pretty hard.

09:31.387 --> 09:33.888
-My butt is fine.
-Okay.

09:33.982 --> 09:35.965
Ah! Come on, man.

09:35.984 --> 09:37.892
Somebody didn't find their zen.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.061
You, uh, got a new bartender?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.154
(exhales)
My cousin Darren.

09:41.306 --> 09:43.156
Every couple years he rolls back

09:43.308 --> 09:44.749
into town broke
and needing a job.

09:44.976 --> 09:46.233
My grandma guilts me
into hiring him

09:46.253 --> 09:47.735
and then a week later
I got to fire him.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.921
Last time he started
a grease fire in the kitchen,

09:50.073 --> 09:51.089
tried to put it out with vodka.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.740
The good stuff.

09:52.759 --> 09:56.836
Oh. Seriously, I've never felt
more relaxed after a workout.

09:56.913 --> 09:58.245
And I've never been so tight.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.007
Yeah, people don't usually swear
during a yoga class.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.842
(grunting softly)

10:02.994 --> 10:05.437
Come here, you big toe bitch!

10:05.588 --> 10:08.923
You know why I couldn't relax?
It was too damn hot in there.

10:09.092 --> 10:10.850
The heat's supposed to increase
your heart rate,

10:11.019 --> 10:12.426
help your body release toxins.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.530
Oh, Carter definitely
released some toxins.

10:16.432 --> 10:17.699
(farts)

10:19.027 --> 10:20.343
That wasn't me.

10:20.436 --> 10:22.436
-It wasn't me!
-It's okay,

10:22.605 --> 10:24.347
it's all, uh,
part of the process.

10:24.366 --> 10:25.365
I'm ready to get
back to lifting.

10:25.517 --> 10:26.866
We on for Thursday morning?

10:27.018 --> 10:29.352
Actually, I think I'm going
to a yoga class with Oscar.

10:29.521 --> 10:30.962
-Again?
-You should come, too.

10:31.189 --> 10:33.114
-I promise it gets easier.
-Nah, nah.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.300
Uh-uh, I'm good. You two enjoy.

10:35.451 --> 10:38.428
Good luck stretching your way
through a street fight.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.697
Hey, Darren, I need some ice.

10:40.715 --> 10:43.808
Oh, you know what, dude?
I think I messed up.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.369
I pressed the button on the
machine and all the ice melted,

10:46.388 --> 10:47.628
-so...
-Darren, you fired.

10:47.722 --> 10:49.205
Yep. Grandma already on her way

10:49.224 --> 10:50.649
to pick me up, so...

10:52.894 --> 10:54.486
You know, I-I changed my mind.

10:54.713 --> 10:56.971
I don't think we should do this.
It's an invasion of privacy.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.033
Plus, I don't even know what
I would say if Preston sees me.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.401
-I get it.
We can totally go home.

11:01.553 --> 11:03.236
-(exhales)
-Can I have that?

11:03.330 --> 11:07.123
Well, weird time for a snack,
and that's coming from me.

11:07.909 --> 11:09.459
-Randi, no!
-Too late.

11:16.568 --> 11:17.417
Hi. Pizza delivery.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.085
Sorry I'm late,
there was traffic.

11:19.237 --> 11:21.495
Preston, baby,
did you order food?

11:21.515 --> 11:24.741
Getting harder to believe
it's an aunt.

11:24.759 --> 11:26.685
You know what? I think
I have the wrong apartment.

11:26.836 --> 11:28.594
Ooh, but before I go,
I love your hardwood floors.

11:28.747 --> 11:30.413
Do all the units have them?
What about laundry?

11:30.432 --> 11:32.673
Do you have a pool
in this building?

11:32.884 --> 11:35.985
This is not how you treat
a potential neighbor.

11:39.257 --> 11:40.681
I hate being right.

11:40.701 --> 11:41.774
No you don't.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.993
In this case, I do.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.579
♪ ♪

11:48.600 --> 11:51.710
See, the trick is...
to hinge at the hips,

11:51.861 --> 11:53.194
keep your feet planted

11:53.213 --> 11:55.380
and lift with your legs.

11:55.607 --> 11:57.048
Hinge, plant, lift.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.033
Sounds like a hardware store.

11:59.127 --> 12:01.444
I'll coach you through it.
You ready?

12:01.463 --> 12:03.129
Don't you normally
do this kind of thing

12:03.281 --> 12:04.781
with Max?
Where's he?

12:04.799 --> 12:06.632
Well, uh, Max
has decided to walk

12:06.785 --> 12:09.752
a different fitness path,
in the form of yoga, with Oscar.

12:09.754 --> 12:13.380
B-But I don't care, 'cause I got
my great friend Phil to spot.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.568
I am flattered, but don't you
have other brawnier friends

12:16.795 --> 12:20.572
who enjoy lifting things up
over their heads?

12:20.799 --> 12:23.316
Honestly, I lost most
of my friends in the divorce.

12:23.468 --> 12:25.076
As horrible as my ex-wife
was to me,

12:25.228 --> 12:27.728
she is a party
in cheetah-print stilettos.

12:27.822 --> 12:32.308
Honey, I... lifting weights
just isn't my thing.

12:32.401 --> 12:33.734
Then why'd you say you'd come?

12:33.812 --> 12:36.145
Well, I didn't think
we would actually work out.

12:36.164 --> 12:38.147
I thought we would
just take a lap,

12:38.166 --> 12:41.408
see who we know and grab a bite.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.836
Look, I think
you should try this once.

12:43.989 --> 12:46.005
-(moans)
-Okay?

12:46.099 --> 12:47.156
Okay, on the count of three.

12:47.325 --> 12:50.560
-One, two...
-Three.

12:52.588 --> 12:54.013
-Oh!
-(grunts)

12:54.165 --> 12:55.681
-Yeah!
-Oh!

12:55.834 --> 12:57.091
(laughs):
Oh!

12:57.185 --> 12:59.444
-Way to go, Phil.
-(laughs)

12:59.595 --> 13:01.671
Oh, I feel so good.

13:01.764 --> 13:03.281
-Yeah, you do. Oh!
-(shouts)

13:05.101 --> 13:07.327
Breakfast is on me.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.940
So, it was definitely Preston?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.459
Yep, no doubt about it.

13:14.610 --> 13:16.686
And he has the audacity to be
cheating in one of the nicest

13:16.704 --> 13:20.281
one-bedroom-plus-office
apartments I have ever seen.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.026
What?
It's like he's taunting me.

13:23.194 --> 13:24.618
What are you gonna do?

13:24.712 --> 13:27.030
I don't know. I was tossing
and turning all night.

13:27.123 --> 13:28.622
Well, you have to tell Sheila.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.623
Do I?

13:29.701 --> 13:30.883
I wish somebody had told me

13:31.052 --> 13:33.202
that Marty was stepping out.

13:33.221 --> 13:34.871
Other than Marty.

13:34.889 --> 13:37.707
And what if Oscar was cheating?
You would want to know, right?

13:37.800 --> 13:38.983
I guess so.

13:39.210 --> 13:40.652
Ouch, just thinking
about that hurts.

13:40.879 --> 13:42.211
And remember what happened
with Daniel?

13:42.230 --> 13:43.804
You had found out
he'd been married,

13:43.824 --> 13:45.156
and you didn't tell me
right away.

13:45.308 --> 13:46.899
I didn't want to upset you.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.568
But you did upset me, even more

13:48.720 --> 13:50.644
than if you had just
told me straight out.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.221
And he wasn't even cheating.

13:52.315 --> 13:54.815
Imagine how hurt and mad
Sheila would be if she finds out

13:54.835 --> 13:56.501
that you knew
and didn't tell her.

13:56.728 --> 14:00.547
And now that I know, I don't
know how long I can keep it in.

14:01.566 --> 14:02.656
Hello, all.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.551
Hello, Mother.

14:10.166 --> 14:12.350
What is so important
that you had to rush me up here?

14:12.501 --> 14:14.577
Oh, we didn't rush. You got
a coffee, you didn't like it,

14:14.596 --> 14:17.188
I made you a new coffee,
you said hi to three cats.

14:17.265 --> 14:18.672
It encourages them.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.860
The cats with higher self-esteem
get adopted faster.

14:22.087 --> 14:24.253
Come, come sit with me.

14:24.272 --> 14:26.180
Y-You seem stressed.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.349
Oh, you got your first wrinkle.

14:28.443 --> 14:30.443
I'll make an appointment
with my guy.

14:31.262 --> 14:33.204
-No, please don't do that.
-(sighs)

14:33.431 --> 14:35.948
Well, at least take this cream.

14:36.101 --> 14:38.376
It's experimental,
but it stings,

14:38.603 --> 14:41.254
so you know
it's doing something.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.340
Mother...

14:45.960 --> 14:48.469
...Preston is cheating on you.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.616
I know.

14:53.635 --> 14:55.284
You do?

14:55.286 --> 14:58.121
The woman's name is Susan,

14:58.139 --> 15:01.357
He's been seeing her
for a few months now.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.459
But h...

15:03.478 --> 15:04.736
Wh...

15:04.887 --> 15:09.148
Wait, are the two of you,
like, keeping things open?

15:09.984 --> 15:11.409
I mean, if so,
that's great, you know?

15:11.560 --> 15:13.227
I just need to try to figure out
how to forget all this

15:13.246 --> 15:16.063
and wash my brain with soap.
(gags)

15:16.157 --> 15:19.566
No, no.
Preston is cheating on me.

15:19.661 --> 15:21.310
He doesn't know I know.

15:21.329 --> 15:22.995
Well, how did you find out?

15:23.164 --> 15:25.632
He's stupid.

15:26.501 --> 15:27.574
Well, I know that.

15:27.669 --> 15:31.170
The first clue was
he bought a new toupee.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.414
Then he stopped wearing socks
with his loafers.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.324
Things added up pretty quickly
after that.

15:35.343 --> 15:38.394
W-Why are you still with him?

15:39.164 --> 15:41.164
Nobody's perfect.

15:41.182 --> 15:43.166
I don't like to be alone.

15:43.184 --> 15:44.943
And when he's with me,

15:45.094 --> 15:47.170
we have a nice time.

15:47.188 --> 15:50.173
It's not ideal, but...

15:50.266 --> 15:51.265
it's good enough.

15:51.359 --> 15:52.766
But you could meet other people.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.787
Uh, join a few dating apps.
Like, see who's out there.

15:55.938 --> 15:58.605
Sweetie, I've watched you
try to date over the years,

15:58.625 --> 16:02.535
and, no offense,
but what a nightmare.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.188
So-so you're just done?

16:05.206 --> 16:06.522
This is it for you?

16:06.524 --> 16:09.041
I already met
the love of my life.

16:09.194 --> 16:11.544
And had 42 wonderful years
with him.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.880
Everything after your father
is just a bonus.

16:15.033 --> 16:16.365
Besides, it's nice

16:16.459 --> 16:18.534
to have someone around
who can put up shelves

16:18.553 --> 16:20.386
and clean the gutters.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.814
Well, what you just described
is a handyman,

16:22.965 --> 16:24.315
and we can get you one of those.

16:24.467 --> 16:26.300
Well, what if
I fall down the stairs?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.486
There's a button for that.
I'll sign you up.

16:28.637 --> 16:31.047
What about our vacation--
who's gonna carry my suitcases?

16:31.140 --> 16:33.140
A bellman or two or three?

16:33.159 --> 16:35.326
Just pack less.

16:36.404 --> 16:38.145
I'm fine with the way
things are.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.905
You deserve more than fine.

16:40.058 --> 16:41.499
I mean, what is it
you always told me?

16:41.576 --> 16:44.727
Never settle for crumbs when
you're worth a whole cookie.

16:44.746 --> 16:46.838
I can see now why
you don't like me interfering

16:47.065 --> 16:48.006
in your love life.

16:48.233 --> 16:49.749
It's annoying.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.260
Please, stay out of it.

16:54.922 --> 16:55.847
I'll leave the cream.

16:56.074 --> 16:57.515
Uh, don't wear it
while you sleep.

16:57.666 --> 17:00.435
It'll burn a hole
in your pillowcase.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.913
We're getting a little low
on rum.

17:03.931 --> 17:05.097
Well, order some.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.916
You're the one
always pushing mai tais.

17:06.934 --> 17:08.100
Okay.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.528
-Are you all right?
-Oh, I'm fine.

17:10.679 --> 17:13.531
Come on, Carter.
Something's bothering you.

17:13.758 --> 17:16.092
Well, maybe it's that I had to
work out with Phil this morning,

17:16.185 --> 17:17.443
and my whole day's
been off ever since.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.204
Well, you and I
can work out on Friday.

17:20.356 --> 17:21.873
Well, we used to work out
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

17:22.100 --> 17:25.618
That was my week. Friday is like
a whole other way of living.

17:25.694 --> 17:28.437
Well, I mean, you could
come with Oscar and me to yoga.

17:28.439 --> 17:30.381
Come on, man.
You saw me at yoga.

17:30.533 --> 17:33.384
I looked like some sort
of wounded grasshopper.

17:33.536 --> 17:35.720
And where the hell
did Oscar come from?

17:35.889 --> 17:37.638
Working out was our thing.

17:39.284 --> 17:40.391
So you miss me.

17:40.618 --> 17:42.952
How could I miss you?
We spend all day together.

17:43.045 --> 17:45.104
(laughs)

17:45.214 --> 17:48.124
Carter, I'm not
dumping you for Oscar.

17:48.126 --> 17:49.809
You're not?

17:49.961 --> 17:51.069
Of course not.

17:51.220 --> 17:53.145
You are the best guy friend
I ever had,

17:53.298 --> 17:54.814
and that's not gonna change.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.984
Wow, that yoga really helped me
get in touch with my emotions.

17:59.137 --> 18:01.137
Ooh. What about you, flexy?

18:01.155 --> 18:02.805
Don't treat me
like a ten-year-old.

18:02.898 --> 18:05.083
Well, you are a ten-year-old.
Ten-year-olds flinch.

18:05.234 --> 18:06.584
-Uh...
-Look at you flinch.

18:06.735 --> 18:08.327
Hey, don't hit me unless
you want it to go down.

18:08.479 --> 18:10.329
I've been lifting weights.
You've been standing on one leg

18:10.481 --> 18:12.757
with both arms in the air.

18:12.908 --> 18:14.425
All right, how about this:

18:14.460 --> 18:17.428
one week we'll lift weights,
one week we'll do yoga.

18:18.247 --> 18:19.430
Is Oscar gonna be there?

18:19.657 --> 18:21.173
Yes.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.101
Oscar's a great guy, and

18:23.328 --> 18:25.586
I hate to break it
to you, but...

18:25.605 --> 18:27.163
he's stronger than you are.

18:27.181 --> 18:29.107
-No, he's not.
-Only one way to find out.

18:29.334 --> 18:32.926
Okay, I will see both of you
at the gym tomorrow.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.278
Tomorrow's yoga.

18:34.388 --> 18:35.446
Damn.

18:35.673 --> 18:36.839
-Oh...
-Flinched again.

18:36.858 --> 18:38.032
-I swear to God, you...
-(exclaims)

18:39.786 --> 18:41.101
Wait, how about this one?

18:41.195 --> 18:43.179
Co-op building,
one bedroom, one bath,

18:43.197 --> 18:44.771
walkable neighborhood.

18:44.866 --> 18:45.848
Ooh, let me see.

18:45.867 --> 18:47.516
Oh, nope. I've been to that one.

18:47.535 --> 18:50.277
The co-op building is just
some creepy guy's house.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.778
Gross.

18:51.873 --> 18:54.448
He did say he would do
my laundry for me, though.

18:54.542 --> 18:57.510
-So I'm keeping it
on my "maybe" list.
-(knocking on door)

18:58.621 --> 18:59.679
Hi.

19:00.715 --> 19:01.788
May I come in?

19:01.883 --> 19:03.307
Absolutely.

19:03.534 --> 19:05.309
Hey, Sheila.

19:09.223 --> 19:12.024
I ended things with Preston.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.819
Oh, I'm so sorry.

19:15.046 --> 19:16.320
Me too.

19:16.547 --> 19:18.472
I was hoping I-I could
stay here for a few days.

19:18.566 --> 19:21.701
I'd rather not be there
while he packs his things.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.069
Of course. Anything you need.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.830
I'd love a cup of tea.

19:26.057 --> 19:29.408
No sugar, splash of lemon.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.576
Uh-huh. Coming right up.

19:30.728 --> 19:34.321
And then, I was thinking,
while I'm here,

19:34.340 --> 19:36.841
we could start
going through your closet.

19:36.992 --> 19:38.342
I have a lot of thoughts.

19:38.569 --> 19:41.679
Ooh, I do, too.
This is gonna be fun.

19:46.761 --> 19:49.261
-Did you find the towels?
-I did.

19:49.414 --> 19:52.732
And I regret
not bringing my own.

20:00.107 --> 20:03.242
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night.

20:07.265 --> 20:09.582
-Katharine?
-Yeah?

20:12.528 --> 20:14.337
