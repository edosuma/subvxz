WEBVTT

00:19.680 --> 00:23.760
[man] You leave shortly for the moon,
a journey of 240,000 miles.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.520
Now, if successful,
you will be the first men

00:26.600 --> 00:29.160
to walk on the surface
of another heavenly body.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.640
What exactly do you hope to discover?

00:31.840 --> 00:35.200
[Neil Armstrong] I think
even more important than the answers

00:35.280 --> 00:37.240
that we'll be able
to find will be the fact

00:37.320 --> 00:40.800
that we get
a whole bunch of new questions to ask.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.280
-[reporters shout]
-[cameras click]

00:43.360 --> 00:45.400
-[reporter 1] Mr. Armstrong.
-[reporter 2] Uh, Neil.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.800
Neil! Marvin Miles, Los Angeles Times.

00:47.880 --> 00:51.760
Uh, the descent onto the lunar surface
appears to be, uh, very challenging.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.520
How far will you burn down,

00:53.600 --> 00:56.440
and how low could you stage an abort
if necessary?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.920
We have made some significant improvements

01:01.000 --> 01:03.240
in the flight control system
in recent months.

01:03.840 --> 01:08.040
The powered descent will be handled
by the computer to a large degree.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.320
[reporters shout]

01:09.400 --> 01:11.920
[journalist 2] Colonel Aldrin,
after you land on the moon,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.160
what do you anticipate
from those first moments?

01:14.240 --> 01:17.440
Any expectations, hopes, anxieties?

01:18.240 --> 01:21.280
Well, uh, immediately upon touchdown,

01:21.360 --> 01:23.800
our concern is the integrity
of the lunar module.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.200
Without that integrity,

01:26.280 --> 01:29.520
we cannot safely continue
with the lunar surface work...

01:29.600 --> 01:31.080
-Are those the astronauts?
-Hmm.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.000
-[journalist 1] You are humble men...
-Why are they in a box?

01:34.080 --> 01:35.760
So as not to catch any germs.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.600
...and encapsulate
something deeply human.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.040
Are you going to sit down
or just stand there hovering?

01:41.120 --> 01:42.560
...to, uh, push boundaries.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.080
Without exploration,
without asking questions,

01:45.160 --> 01:49.840
are we not destined
for sort of, uh, stasis as a species?

01:50.200 --> 01:53.480
The American State Department
asked if I wanted to send a message.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.080
-What kind of message?
-For the astronauts to leave on the moon.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.480
They approached a handful of individuals
from around the globe.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.480
A cross-section of human civilization

02:02.960 --> 02:06.000
to provide a message
of a shared and common humanity.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.320
What did you say?

02:08.200 --> 02:09.720
"On behalf of the British people,

02:09.800 --> 02:13.040
I salute the skill and courage
that have brought man to the moon.

02:13.120 --> 02:16.960
May this endeavor increase
the knowledge and well-being of mankind."

02:19.960 --> 02:21.200
One of your very best.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.960
How will it be, um, communicated?

02:27.480 --> 02:28.920
On a disc, apparently.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.600
-What kind of disc?
-A silicon disc.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.800
They sent a picture. A tiny disc,

02:33.880 --> 02:37.600
with tiny, microscopic inscriptions
in golden lettering.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.560
"From Planet Earth, July 1969."

02:40.800 --> 02:43.160
Which they intend to leave
in a little white pouch.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.040
-With an olive branch.
-An olive branch?

02:45.120 --> 02:47.120
Yes, for the little green men
to wave about.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.520
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles]

02:54.240 --> 02:56.200
[yawns] I'm going to bed.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.440
Oh, and church tomorrow is
at nine, not ten.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.920
[indistinct chatter on TV]

03:11.800 --> 03:13.200
[sighs]

04:24.240 --> 04:26.320
[church bells ring]

04:34.520 --> 04:35.960
[Philip] Why do we do this?

04:36.640 --> 04:37.560
[groans]

04:37.640 --> 04:40.600
Week in, week out. Like lemmings.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.960
What does it do for you?

04:44.960 --> 04:45.960
-Honestly.
-Church?

04:46.040 --> 04:47.240
Hmm.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.040
It's a chance to take stock.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.280
Reflect on the past week.
Think ahead to the next.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.880
You can use a diary for that.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.400
-And to think of life's bigger questions.
-Except one doesn't.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.920
One mainly thinks about

05:00.000 --> 05:03.480
what a lot of dreary nonsense the dean
is talking and why doesn't he shut up.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.320
He's been with us for nearly 20 years.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.960
That might make him loyal,
it does not make him interesting.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.480
-Shh!
-Hello there.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.600
[dean] They have mouths,
but they speak not.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.080
Eyes have they, but they see not.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.640
They have ears, but they hear not.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.800
Noses have they, but they...

05:24.680 --> 05:25.560
Uh...

05:26.640 --> 05:27.560
Uh...

05:28.080 --> 05:28.960
Um...

05:30.920 --> 05:32.200
-You see?
-Shh.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.920
It's not a sermon,
it's a general anesthetic.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.600
Ah, but they smell not.

05:39.240 --> 05:42.520
They that make them are alike unto them.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.880
So is everyone that trusteth in...

05:44.960 --> 05:46.840
-That's it. That's the last time.
-Shh.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.120
And so the Lord...

05:48.200 --> 05:50.600
From now on,
on Sunday while you lot are in here,

05:50.680 --> 05:53.240
I'm going to spend this hour
doing something useful.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.760
...but unto His name give glory,

05:57.360 --> 06:00.520
nor to false idols, either.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.280
[exhales]

06:04.360 --> 06:06.080
[Philip sighs]

06:06.160 --> 06:07.640
Uh... ah.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.440
[clears throat]

06:09.520 --> 06:11.480
-[Elizabeth] Michael.
-[Adeane] Ma'am.

06:15.880 --> 06:20.040
Is it possible, do you think,
the dean might have reached...

06:20.800 --> 06:24.280
How can I put this kindly?
The moment of his own obsolescence?

06:24.360 --> 06:27.000
I noticed one or two people
struggling to stay awake.

06:27.080 --> 06:30.520
We could discreetly start the search
for a replacement.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.320
Could we? Someone with a bit of...

06:32.400 --> 06:34.240
-Oomph.
-I think so.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.760
-Zest.
-That's it.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.800
-Pep.
-Yes, thank--

06:36.880 --> 06:38.000
-Vim.
-Thank you.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.600
[whacking]

07:00.600 --> 07:02.760
[pants]

07:09.600 --> 07:10.640
[exhales deeply]

07:17.360 --> 07:21.760
[man on TV] And so, here at Cape Kennedy,
we're all off to the moon this morning.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.280
-[Andrew] Are you watching, Anne?
-[Edward] Anne! Play with us!

07:24.360 --> 07:27.560
[man on TV] Mighty Saturn V,
the big Moon Express,

07:27.680 --> 07:30.680
all ready to leave platform 39
here at Cape Kennedy,

07:30.760 --> 07:34.320
on time in about 30 minutes.

07:34.880 --> 07:38.960
This enormous event
which uniquely unites all the world

07:39.600 --> 07:43.000
because all the world
can be interested in this journey,

07:43.640 --> 07:47.000
and after this journey,
we on Earth can never be the same.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.920
[dog whines]

08:01.640 --> 08:03.000
[dog barks]

08:03.680 --> 08:04.680
[dog whines]

08:04.760 --> 08:06.840
-Where is she?
-Who, sir?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.360
If I say "she,"
and we're in Buckingham Palace,

08:09.440 --> 08:10.760
who do you think I mean?

08:16.600 --> 08:19.040
There you are. I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

08:19.120 --> 08:21.840
On the telephone, interviewing candidates
to become the new dean.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.440
-Anyone good?
-Yes, I think we've found one.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.440
-How old?
-Same age as you, I'd say.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.240
-Really?
-And a good fit.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.800
-For what?
-For the job I've asked him to do.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.080
[man on TV]
T minus 15 seconds. Guidance is internal.

08:35.560 --> 08:39.400
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine...

08:39.480 --> 08:41.360
Ignition sequence starts.

08:41.720 --> 08:42.640
Six...

08:42.720 --> 08:46.720
[children] Five, four, three, two, one.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.040
Liftoff. We have a liftoff.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.880
Thirty-two minutes past the hour.
Liftoff on Apollo 11.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.080
Extraordinary.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.600
What men, what courage.

08:59.680 --> 09:02.200
-Tower clear.
-[Armstrong] We got a roll program.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.800
[man] Neil Armstrong reporting
the rolling pitch program, which puts...

09:13.400 --> 09:16.240
[control] 11, Houston. Thrust is go,
all engines. You're looking good.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.400
[radio beeps]

09:17.480 --> 09:19.600
[Buzz Aldrin]
Roger, you're loud and clear, Houston.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.240
[control] We got skirt sep.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.560
-[Armstrong] Roger, we confirm skirt sep.
-[radio beeps]

09:29.800 --> 09:32.200
-[control] Tower's gone.
-[Armstrong] Roger. Tower.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.480
[commentator] Neil Armstrong confirming
both the engine skirt separation

09:36.560 --> 09:38.920
and the launch escape tower separation.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.160
[control] Apollo 11, this is Houston.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.800
Slightly less than one minute to ignition
and everything is go.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.120
-[radio beeps]
-[Armstrong] Roger.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.320
Ignition.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.440
We confirm ignition, and the thrust is go.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.600
-[radio beeps]
-[indistinct radio chatter]

09:57.680 --> 09:59.040
[Armstrong] It's looking good.

10:07.080 --> 10:11.480
[commentator] Apollo 11 has now completed
its trans-lunar injection burn,

10:11.560 --> 10:13.640
meaning it is free of Earth's orbit,

10:13.720 --> 10:19.920
and traveling at the colossal speed
of 24,200 miles an hour towards the moon.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.960
The astronauts have now completed

10:22.040 --> 10:25.600
what they call the transposition,
docking and extraction maneuver.

10:25.680 --> 10:29.520
This rather risky procedure is when
the command service module, Columbia,

10:29.600 --> 10:32.880
detaches from the rest of the spacecraft,
drifts forward a little,

10:33.200 --> 10:36.680
flips over, then reattaches
to the lunar module, Eagle.

10:36.760 --> 10:40.400
This new assembly then detaches
from the final stage of the Saturn rocket.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.360
As I say, a hair-raising business,

10:42.440 --> 10:44.520
but it all seems to have gone off
without a hitch.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.840
[man] Tuesday next week,
you will be in Cheshire

10:46.920 --> 10:48.920
to visit the works
of British Salt Limited.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.360
On Wednesday, it's Norfolk
to inaugurate a new gas terminal.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.520
Then on Friday,

10:53.600 --> 10:56.680
it's Macclesfield for the open day

10:56.760 --> 10:59.240
of the Machine Tool Industry
Research Association.

10:59.440 --> 11:04.240
That evening, there will be a dinner
given by the British Concrete Society,

11:04.320 --> 11:06.440
where you have been asked
to present an award.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.640
-[knocking at door]
-[door opens]

11:10.000 --> 11:12.640
-May I interrupt, Your Royal Highness?
-What?

11:12.720 --> 11:15.560
The newly appointed Dean of Windsor,
Robin Woods,

11:15.640 --> 11:17.640
was wondering
if you could spare him a moment.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.720
-He has a request.
-Fine. Just put something in the book.

11:21.560 --> 11:23.160
Another highlight to look forward to,

11:23.240 --> 11:26.240
along with the award show
for the British Concrete Society.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.640
-Is that a joke?
-Afraid not, sir.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.440
Uh, actually, he's here now.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.320
Hello?

11:38.280 --> 11:39.760
Your Royal Highness.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.120
-How can I help?
-[door closes]

11:42.200 --> 11:45.520
In the process of moving in,
my wife and I, we couldn't help noticing

11:45.600 --> 11:48.480
that there were a large number
of buildings on the estate of Windsor

11:48.560 --> 11:50.800
that appear to be empty and unused.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.200
Specifically...

11:53.360 --> 11:54.680
the old canons' cloisters,

11:54.760 --> 11:57.400
one or two of the buildings
on Denton's Commons,

11:57.520 --> 12:01.720
all the houses on the North Walls,
the old residences of the minor canons.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.760
I-I realize this is quite...

12:04.120 --> 12:06.040
forward of me, but I was wondering

12:06.120 --> 12:08.160
if I could make a request
to use one of them.

12:08.240 --> 12:11.120
Wha...
You don't like the home we've given you?

12:11.560 --> 12:12.600
No...

12:13.960 --> 12:15.320
this wouldn't be as a home.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.560
For a long time now,
I've had a dream, an ambition,

12:19.640 --> 12:21.840
to start an academy or conservatoire.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.640
Uh... What for?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.040
Personal and spiritual growth.

12:28.800 --> 12:32.080
Something that has struck me,
from my own experience,

12:32.160 --> 12:35.760
but also from observing it in...
well, in others,

12:36.280 --> 12:39.320
is that you get to a certain age
and you hit a ceiling,

12:39.840 --> 12:41.640
a crisis, if you will. You...

12:41.960 --> 12:45.320
You lose perspective. Get into a slump.

12:46.120 --> 12:49.120
It's quite common
among businessmen and executives,

12:49.200 --> 12:51.280
and it's no different for clergymen.

12:51.360 --> 12:54.400
We see a particularly high level
of dissatisfaction

12:54.480 --> 12:56.200
-among mid-career clergymen...
-Yes.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.960
...and I thought one of these buildings,
in its idyllic setting,

12:59.040 --> 13:03.840
would be a great place
for priests to come and recharge,

13:03.920 --> 13:06.240
reflect, raise their game.

13:08.600 --> 13:09.600
By doing what?

13:11.520 --> 13:14.120
Talking, reading, thinking.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.120
May I suggest that your concept is flawed?

13:18.520 --> 13:21.240
You don't raise your game
by talking or thinking.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.920
You raise your game through action.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.160
Like this.
This is how you get out of a slump.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.240
But if...
if one of those buildings is free,

13:30.320 --> 13:32.800
and you want to fill it
with hot air and thought,

13:32.880 --> 13:34.360
then be my guest.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.040
Thank you, sir.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.360
[door opens]

13:42.800 --> 13:43.840
[door closes]

13:44.160 --> 13:45.240
[scoffs]

13:46.640 --> 13:50.440
[commentator] We don't have to wait
long now, 17 minutes and counting.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.600
The landing craft has separated
from the command module

13:53.680 --> 13:56.120
and has begun its descent
to the surface of the moon.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.840
Armstrong and Aldrin
will now send the lunar module

13:58.920 --> 14:01.280
into a sort of pirouette
to allow Collins...

14:01.360 --> 14:03.720
-Nigel, will you wake the children?
-Yes, sir.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.920
-And tell the Queen, please. Thank you.
-Sir.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.560
Andrew, darling. It's time.

14:12.840 --> 14:13.840
Edward.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.200
Edward. Time to wake up.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.440
Come on. Dressing gown on.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.240
[Andrew] Come on, Edward. Hurry up.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.800
Hold on.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.040
-Let's go.
-Come on!

14:28.520 --> 14:31.240
-[Elizabeth] It's a very exciting evening.
-It certainly is.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.320
[Elizabeth] Are you able
to join us for a drink?

14:33.400 --> 14:34.880
[Nigel] That would be very nice.
Thank you.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.360
[Elizabeth] Not at all.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.120
[commentator] Michael Collins
left alone in the orbiter now,

14:39.200 --> 14:41.040
meaning when it passes behind the moon,

14:41.120 --> 14:43.560
he'll be entirely cut off
from the rest of humanity.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.920
-The loneliest man in the universe.
-[door opens]

14:46.240 --> 14:48.480
-Quickly, Andrew.
-Quick. Quick. Quick.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.560
[overlapping chatter]

14:50.640 --> 14:51.600
Try to sit still.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.840
Come on, space hopper.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.440
[commentator]
Only a couple of thousand feet

14:55.520 --> 14:58.160
above the surface of the moon now.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.120
Gosh.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.520
Their landing site, chosen
for its smoothness, but not entirely...

15:02.600 --> 15:04.400
[Elizabeth] Do take a seat, please.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.480
...slightest impact with rock or crater
could disable the lunar module...

15:08.560 --> 15:10.800
-Drink, sir?
-[Elizabeth] Robert, can you see?

15:11.320 --> 15:14.040
-It's Robert's birthday.
-[Aldrin] Altitude's a little high.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.480
Houston, I'm getting a little fluctuation
in the...

15:16.560 --> 15:17.720
[Andrew] They're about to land.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.720
-What is that?
-I don't know.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.800
Yes, hard to believe.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.760
-John, hurry up, you're going to miss it.
-Shh!

15:23.520 --> 15:24.920
What are they saying?

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
That he's gone to manual control.
Something's wrong.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.360
-[Queen Mother] Doesn't look real.
-[Elizabeth] I know.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.800
[Aldrin] Three hundred and fifty feet.
Down at four.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.640
[Anne] What'll happen if they can't land?

15:38.520 --> 15:42.120
No, they'll run out of fuel.
Quiet, please. Just, shh!

15:42.200 --> 15:44.440
-[Aldrin] Down two and a half.
-[Philip] Shh. Please.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.520
[Andrew] They're about to land.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.920
What's happening now?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.560
[crackling on TV]

16:05.680 --> 16:08.480
[Armstrong]
Houston, uh, Tranquility Base here.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.000
-The Eagle has landed.
-[reporter] Man on the moon.

16:11.080 --> 16:15.240
-[Andrew] They did it!
-[reporter] Man has landed on the moon.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.320
[overlapping chatter]

16:18.600 --> 16:20.720
-Did you see?
-[Edward] Yes, Papa.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.680
[reporter]
As we watch these images tonight,

16:22.760 --> 16:25.960
we are united across the world in a...

16:26.400 --> 16:28.520
-Extraordinary.
-...uniform sense of wonder.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.440
-Never before has the entire planet...
-Shall we fly to the moon?

16:31.520 --> 16:35.160
No, don't, darling.
Mind his head. Mind his head.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.600
-[chuckles]
-Meteor.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.760
To each of us, this is historic.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.000
-[Philip] The Eagle has landed.
-To some of us, this is even divine.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.240
-Can you believe they're on the moon?
-And yet...

16:47.320 --> 16:52.480
...all of us, regardless of race, sex,
or religious belief,

16:52.560 --> 16:57.800
we are united right now
in this singular human achievement.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.000
[control] OK, Neil, we can see you
coming down the ladder now.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.000
[Armstrong]
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

17:04.360 --> 17:11.320
The LM footpads are only depressed
in the surface about one or two inches,

17:11.400 --> 17:13.880
although the surface appears to be

17:14.560 --> 17:17.520
very, very fine grained
as you get close to it.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.640
It's almost like a powder.

17:20.360 --> 17:22.680
Down there, uh, it's very fine.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.480
I'm going to step off the LM now.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.000
That's one small step for man...

17:34.640 --> 17:37.400
one giant leap for mankind.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.200
It has a stark beauty all its own.

17:43.280 --> 17:47.480
It's, uh, like much of the high desert
of the United States.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.680
It's, uh, different,
but it's very pretty out here.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.640
[reporter] This is a powerful reminder

17:54.720 --> 17:57.480
of our capacity for greatness
as a species.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.680
Not simply the engineering triumph
represented here today,

18:01.760 --> 18:04.280
but the triumph of human ambition.

18:04.480 --> 18:08.040
The desire to reach
quite literally for the stars.

18:09.320 --> 18:13.320
And I think this new perspective,
seeing the Earth from space,

18:13.400 --> 18:15.760
in all our unity and cohesion,

18:16.040 --> 18:19.720
is likely to inspire
an unprecedented shift in our thinking.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.480
-[control] Beautiful view.
-[Armstrong] Isn't that something?

18:23.360 --> 18:25.000
Magnificent sight out here.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.080
[chuckles]

18:26.160 --> 18:27.920
[control] Magnificent desolation.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.680
[thunder]

18:34.400 --> 18:35.800
[microphone feedback]

18:36.760 --> 18:38.920
[thunder]

18:40.440 --> 18:41.640
[clears throat]

18:42.560 --> 18:43.440
Uh...

18:43.760 --> 18:45.520
Mr. Governor, ladies and gentlemen,

18:45.600 --> 18:49.040
esteemed members
of the Wool Textile Delegation.

18:51.480 --> 18:52.880
I very much appreciate

18:52.960 --> 18:56.360
the honor you have bestowed on me
by your invitation

18:56.880 --> 19:01.040
to the mill of Thomas Burnley &amp; Sons,
here in Yorkshire.

19:02.200 --> 19:06.320
The groundbreaking work
you are doing here by embracing...

19:07.600 --> 19:09.600
[whirring]

19:10.720 --> 19:16.040
[Philip] There comes a time,
a moment in everyone's experience

19:16.120 --> 19:22.240
where dentures and other oral prosthetics
become an indispensable fact of life.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.840
[chuckling]

19:23.920 --> 19:27.200
According to last year's
adult dental health survey...

19:27.920 --> 19:29.680
[dialogue fades out]

19:42.440 --> 19:44.920
[indistinct chatter on radio]

20:13.080 --> 20:13.960
May I?

20:14.040 --> 20:15.400
[Philip clears throat]

20:15.480 --> 20:16.760
[switch clicks]

20:16.840 --> 20:18.560
-You have control?
-I have control.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.480
What are you doing, sir?

20:25.800 --> 20:28.640
-This isn't on the flight chart.
-There's no other traffic.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.480
[clears throat]

20:37.120 --> 20:38.160
Sir.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.920
Sir, the service ceiling for this aircraft
is 45,000 feet.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.120
You and I both know
it can safely climb way beyond that.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.080
Sir, you...

21:06.280 --> 21:08.000
[beeps]

21:15.520 --> 21:18.760
-Come on. Come on.
-[alarm beeps]

21:23.960 --> 21:24.960
[sighs]

21:26.520 --> 21:27.760
[exhales]

21:29.000 --> 21:31.240
[Philip] God, isn't it beautiful?

21:31.640 --> 21:35.040
I'm sure, but we're currently at the
very limit of what this aircraft can do.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.200
Perhaps, but look.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.280
We've also lived.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.000
Just for a minute.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.760
[man on TV] The first men on the moon

22:04.840 --> 22:07.040
lifted off on the first stage
of their journey home

22:07.120 --> 22:08.680
an hour and six minutes ago.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.560
A new chapter in human history
has opened.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.640
The race for the moon is over.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.200
For the people of this planet,

22:15.280 --> 22:19.000
what is the meaning
of this stupendous venture?

22:45.800 --> 22:49.240
[Woods]
"We shall not cease from exploration,

22:50.120 --> 22:55.520
and the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started

22:55.600 --> 22:58.880
and know the place for the first time."

22:59.160 --> 23:03.000
Those words by TS Eliot
have never rung more true.

23:03.080 --> 23:06.640
We stand at the dawn
of a new age of space exploration.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.760
The promise of space
has never felt more real...

23:27.680 --> 23:29.280
[music plays over dialogue]

23:34.040 --> 23:36.040
[pants]

23:45.000 --> 23:46.440
-Morning, sir.
-Morning, sir.

23:50.360 --> 23:51.440
[car door shuts]

23:56.760 --> 23:58.480
-Your Royal Highness.
-Oh, Christ.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.640
[clears throat]

24:02.080 --> 24:04.640
[grumbles] Morning.

24:04.720 --> 24:08.040
I wonder whether you might have a moment,
sir, to meet the new arrivals.

24:08.120 --> 24:11.640
Ah, your concentration camp
for spiritual defectives?

24:12.320 --> 24:15.840
-I prefer center of recovery and renewal.
-Well, I'm sure you do.

24:16.400 --> 24:19.720
We have an interesting group of all ages
from around the United Kingdom.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.920
-Will you join?
-Join what?

24:22.360 --> 24:25.120
It's an academy
for blocked mid-level priests.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.080
Correct.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.680
Well, in case you hadn't noticed,
I'm not a priest.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.400
Just to say hello.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.640
-What, now?
-Why not?

24:34.200 --> 24:36.120
Fine. Get in. [clears throat]

24:36.960 --> 24:38.880
Do I need to show symptoms of despair?

24:39.240 --> 24:41.680
Should I sigh and moan dramatically?

24:42.320 --> 24:44.000
One does like to fit in.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.160
[clears throat]

24:45.960 --> 24:47.560
[engine starts]

25:05.200 --> 25:08.640
I've brought our landlord,
His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh,

25:08.720 --> 25:09.800
to say hello.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.080
-How do you do, Your Royal Highness?
-Good morning.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.840
-Your Royal Highness.
-Good morning.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.000
-Morning, sir.
-Morning.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.080
-Good morning.
-Your Royal Highness.

25:19.160 --> 25:20.680
[clears throat] So...

25:21.480 --> 25:23.320
What, uh... what have you all been up to?

25:23.400 --> 25:25.840
Apart from making
quite a mess of our house, I see.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.840
[chuckling]

25:26.920 --> 25:31.000
We started by identifying
why each of us had chosen to come here,

25:31.080 --> 25:34.040
and stating what we were
hoping to achieve.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.440
Uh, perhaps we should recap
for His Royal Highness.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.600
Michael.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.080
Well, I'm-I'm here because, uh...

25:45.480 --> 25:49.200
having recently reached a...
a particular age...

25:49.280 --> 25:50.720
[chuckles] I won't ask.

25:50.800 --> 25:51.880
[all chuckle]

25:51.960 --> 25:55.080
I-I decided to give myself a score.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.920
And... I felt I only merited a fail.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.200
D minus.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.760
-Oh, dear.
-And why was that?

26:03.120 --> 26:06.080
Well, when entering the church,

26:06.960 --> 26:10.760
I allowed myself to dream
that advancing age

26:10.840 --> 26:13.280
would bring new revelations.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.040
Insight.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.680
A deepening of my faith.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.720
A growing flock.

26:20.720 --> 26:24.680
But instead I-I find myself
in a small rural parish

26:25.040 --> 26:26.800
with a dwindling congregation.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.680
-Lowering attendance.
-Right.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.920
[Woods] And this has left you
with a sense of disappointment,

26:34.000 --> 26:37.040
of underachievement and directionlessness.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.440
Yes.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.520
That sense of directionlessness
and redundancy is...

26:42.280 --> 26:45.560
Well, it's something that chimed
with one or two others here.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.200
[priest] Because of how the public
has turned away from us.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.200
Turned away from the church.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.400
It's clear we are failing
to connect with people.

26:54.240 --> 26:57.960
More and more people are finding
their spiritual needs being met...

26:58.520 --> 26:59.400
elsewhere.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.880
Where, for example?

27:10.480 --> 27:12.000
The moon. I...

27:12.080 --> 27:14.640
-The moon. Yes, sir.
-[chuckling]

27:16.200 --> 27:18.600
Five hundred million people
watched the lunar landing.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.520
-Yes.
-Five hundred million people

27:20.600 --> 27:24.200
getting from televisions
what they used to get from the church.

27:24.280 --> 27:28.160
A sense of coming together,
a sense of community, of awe, of wonder.

27:28.240 --> 27:31.080
Well, that was part of a wider shift too,
we agreed,

27:31.160 --> 27:32.840
from religion to science.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.520
[priest] The greater
the achievements in science,

27:35.600 --> 27:37.840
the more mysteries are explained,

27:37.920 --> 27:39.560
the more questions are answered,

27:39.640 --> 27:45.240
the less need there is for a god
to provide answers.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.440
[Woods] I'm remind of Keats.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.800
"What is there in thee, moon,

27:51.160 --> 27:55.160
that thou shouldst move my heart
so potently?"

27:56.920 --> 27:58.920
Now we know what the moon is.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.400
Nothing.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.520
Just dust.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.880
Silence.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.360
Monochromatic void.

28:09.160 --> 28:13.400
We see no God
behind those rocks and space dust,

28:13.480 --> 28:17.200
simply an unknowable vastness.

28:18.560 --> 28:23.680
"When I consider Thy heavens,
the work of Thy fingers,

28:24.840 --> 28:28.600
the moon and the stars
that Thou hast ordained...

28:30.240 --> 28:33.120
what is man that Thou art mindful of him?

28:34.080 --> 28:37.000
And the son of man
that Thou visitest him?"

28:41.200 --> 28:42.200
[clears throat]

28:45.760 --> 28:46.920
Any thoughts, sir?

28:52.600 --> 28:53.600
Me?

29:01.960 --> 29:03.320
I'll tell you what I think.

29:03.720 --> 29:07.720
I've never heard such a load
of pretentious, self-piteous nonsense.

29:08.840 --> 29:11.080
What you lot need to do
is to get off your backsides,

29:11.160 --> 29:13.680
get out into the world,
and bloody well do something.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.920
That is why you are all so... so lost.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.440
[sighs]

29:19.520 --> 29:24.960
I believe that there is an imperative
within man, all men, to make a mark.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.720
Action is what defines us.
Action, not suffering.

29:29.120 --> 29:32.160
All this sitting around
thinking and talking...

29:33.480 --> 29:34.840
Let me ask you this.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.120
Do you think those astronauts up there

29:37.200 --> 29:40.160
are catatonic like you lot? Of course not.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.880
They are too busy
achieving something spectacular.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.880
And as a result,
they are at one with the world.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.200
At one with their God.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.240
And happy.

29:53.480 --> 29:54.640
That's my advice.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.360
Model yourselves on men of action,

29:57.440 --> 30:00.560
like Armstrong, Aldrin, Collins.

30:01.080 --> 30:04.120
I mean, these men score A triple plus.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.640
They've got the answers.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.080
Not a bunch of navel-gazing underachievers

30:08.160 --> 30:11.120
infecting one another with gaseous doom.

30:14.840 --> 30:19.040
If you do opt for action, you can start
by cleaning up this bloody floor.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.680
[door opens]

30:24.280 --> 30:25.520
[door slams]

30:27.080 --> 30:28.200
Oh, not again.

30:28.280 --> 30:31.080
Around the same time we were asked
by the American State Department...

30:31.160 --> 30:32.360
It's the second time this week.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.840
...if we'd send that message to the moon
on a silicon disc,

30:34.920 --> 30:36.480
we were also asked another question.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.680
On how many occasions
is the British royal family

30:38.760 --> 30:41.080
-forced to eat venison each year?
-No.

30:41.160 --> 30:44.200
Honestly, I think if I eat
any more of this stuff

30:44.280 --> 30:46.200
I'm going to start growing antlers.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.880
-Are you listening?
-Yes.

30:47.960 --> 30:51.160
I'm all ears. Little brown furry ones.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.200
Well, provided they make it back to Earth
in one piece,

30:54.280 --> 30:56.760
and if after all their tests
they're still standing...

30:56.840 --> 30:57.720
[dog barks]

30:57.800 --> 30:59.680
...would we like an audience
with the astronauts?

31:00.640 --> 31:01.560
[clears throat]

31:03.040 --> 31:05.840
What? Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins?

31:06.440 --> 31:08.240
-Here at the palace?
-Yes.

31:08.680 --> 31:11.040
They're being sent around the world
on a victory tour.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.640
Shall I go back with a yes?

31:14.200 --> 31:17.080
My God. Yes, please.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.280
[chuckles]

31:18.880 --> 31:20.320
I thought that would cheer you up.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.200
It does.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.040
Do I need cheering up?

31:28.480 --> 31:29.480
A little.

31:30.920 --> 31:31.960
[clears throat]

31:35.360 --> 31:37.960
[Charteris] They're scheduled to arrive
at Heathrow Airport at 2:00 p.m.

31:38.040 --> 31:41.240
From there they will be taken directly to
the American Embassy at Grosvenor Square

31:41.320 --> 31:43.200
for a meeting with the US ambassador.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.080
From there they will come
to Buckingham Palace

31:45.160 --> 31:46.880
for an audience
with Her Majesties the Queen,

31:46.960 --> 31:49.680
Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother,
His Royal Highness Duke of Edinburgh,

31:49.760 --> 31:52.880
Princess Margaret, Princess Anne,
Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.920
-And what time will that be?
-Around four o'clock, ma'am.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.680
Will we give them anything? Tea?

31:57.760 --> 32:01.440
Probably not. We thought it good
to keep things moving. No sitting down.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.720
[Elizabeth] I quite agree.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.840
[Adeane] No more than half an hour
from arrival to departure.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.720
[Elizabeth] Right.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.400
I'd like to make a request.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.080
-If I may?
-Sir.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.000
Instead of being herded in
with everyone else,

32:19.080 --> 32:22.880
I was wondering if I might be allowed
some time with the astronauts alone...

32:24.720 --> 32:26.800
in a separate, private meeting.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.480
Uh, airman to airmen.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.400
Pilot to pilots.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.200
[Adeane] I'll speak to the ambassador,

32:34.880 --> 32:37.680
but I'm sure it would be possible our end.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.200
Would 15 minutes be enough?

32:41.600 --> 32:42.880
Fifteen minutes?

32:43.600 --> 32:45.800
They are on a very tight schedule,
I believe.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.960
To discuss mankind's greatest achievement?

32:52.920 --> 32:53.800
No.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.520
It's nowhere near enough.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.440
I can see it's all I'm going to get.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.520
[man on TV] Landing at
London Heathrow Airport from Berlin,

33:29.600 --> 33:33.320
the Apollo moon men begin a hectic
twenty-two-and-a-quarter-hour visit

33:33.400 --> 33:37.480
that demands the same sort of precision
and timing as their mission in space.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.520
The world-famous "Man on the Moon" team

33:39.600 --> 33:42.680
of Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin
and Michael Collins,

33:42.760 --> 33:44.160
accompanied by their wives,

33:44.240 --> 33:47.600
received one of their warmest welcomes
yet from the British people.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.520
The astronauts admitted
that they are starting to feel the strain

33:50.600 --> 33:52.640
of their 22-nation world tour.

33:53.920 --> 33:58.160
[Armstrong] Here man from the planet
Earth first set foot upon the moon.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.800
July 1969.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.080
And I can see everything quite clearly.

34:04.160 --> 34:08.120
The light is, uh, sufficiently bright,

34:08.200 --> 34:12.080
backlighted into the front of the LM,
that everything is very clearly visible.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.960
-[control] Beautiful view.
-[Armstrong] Isn't that something?

34:35.440 --> 34:37.040
Magnificent sight out here.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.560
[radio beeps]

34:40.520 --> 34:43.360
[crowd cheers]

34:48.720 --> 34:51.800
[man on TV] The American astronauts
are now arriving at Buckingham Palace.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.720
The world-famous team of Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins...

34:55.800 --> 34:57.800
[crowd cheers]

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
[crowd cheers]

35:35.640 --> 35:38.000
[Adeane] Your Majesty, Mr. Neil Armstrong.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.320
Hello. Welcome.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.080
-Pleasure to meet you.
-And you.

35:41.160 --> 35:42.360
-Mrs. Armstrong.
-Hello.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.080
-Colonel Michael Collins.
-Hello.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.840
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Great pleasure to meet you.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.280
Great pleasure to meet you, young man.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.240
-[knocking at door]
-[door opens]

36:02.360 --> 36:03.480
[exhales]

36:04.520 --> 36:05.560
[man] Sir.

36:15.560 --> 36:16.600
[cameras click]

36:16.680 --> 36:18.640
[indistinct chatter]

36:31.840 --> 36:34.320
Please don't tell me
you want to talk about children.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.760
[chuckling]

36:53.840 --> 36:56.480
-Have they been waiting long?
-No, only a few moments, sir.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.160
Mr. Neil Armstrong,
Colonel Michael Collins

37:12.240 --> 37:14.040
and Colonel Edwin Aldrin,
Your Royal Highness.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.040
-It is a great, great honor, gentlemen.
-Sir.

37:17.440 --> 37:19.440
-Congratulations one and all.
-Sir.

37:20.080 --> 37:20.960
[door closes]

37:21.040 --> 37:23.360
Please, do, uh... do sit down.

37:24.480 --> 37:25.360
Um...

37:30.840 --> 37:32.280
There's no need to sit so closely.

37:32.360 --> 37:35.240
As you can see, there's plenty of space.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.120
-[chuckling]
-[clears throat]

37:37.720 --> 37:40.000
I notice you instinctively
sat in the same positions

37:40.080 --> 37:42.680
-as the, uh, command module.
-[all chuckle]

37:44.720 --> 37:46.880
Anyway, I don't, I don't know
if anyone told you,

37:46.960 --> 37:49.760
but, uh, I am, uh,
actually a pilot myself.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.120
-[sneezes]
-And I was...

37:51.200 --> 37:53.680
-Are you all right?
-Yes, sir. I just have a cold.

37:53.760 --> 37:54.920
[sniffles]

37:55.640 --> 37:57.440
-Here.
-I...

37:57.920 --> 38:00.560
-It's clean, I promise you.
-Thank you.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.240
-[chuckles]
-[sneezes]

38:03.200 --> 38:06.560
My, you've, uh,
you've, you've all got colds.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.480
Yes, we do.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.160
Well, here we are. Hmm.

38:18.520 --> 38:22.160
I just want to say
how much I admire what you've done.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.040
It's just remarkable.

38:25.760 --> 38:29.600
But also to say how much I identify
in some way with... with who you are.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.800
[sneezing]

38:30.880 --> 38:32.440
-Bless you.
-Sorry.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.920
I, um...

38:36.600 --> 38:38.200
I wrote down some questions.

38:39.760 --> 38:40.760
And...

38:41.600 --> 38:44.880
You see, I initially imagined
that I wanted to ask questions of you

38:44.960 --> 38:46.480
on a technical level.

38:47.800 --> 38:53.280
You know, what is the physical experience
of G-forces of that magnitude,

38:53.680 --> 38:54.720
and so on, but...

38:57.400 --> 38:58.360
You see, I...

38:59.520 --> 39:01.760
I realize now that...

39:03.520 --> 39:07.360
the questions
I actually want answering are...

39:11.400 --> 39:13.920
You're all too young to understand,
I think, but...

39:17.800 --> 39:22.800
There comes a time in life
when one first really starts to evaluate

39:23.560 --> 39:25.240
what one has accomplished.

39:26.520 --> 39:30.120
And because of the position
that I've ended up in here,

39:31.600 --> 39:32.960
who I've become...

39:33.560 --> 39:34.560
Um...

39:36.080 --> 39:37.040
Who I'm married to...

39:37.120 --> 39:38.480
[chuckling]

39:38.560 --> 39:39.600
[Philip] Uh...

39:40.120 --> 39:41.000
I've...

39:42.880 --> 39:46.000
Well, I've not been able to achieve
the things I would have liked to...

39:47.720 --> 39:49.280
as a man, as a...

39:50.840 --> 39:52.200
as an adventurer.

39:53.640 --> 39:57.000
And watching you three heroes at work...

39:59.720 --> 40:01.440
it was like watching a dream.

40:02.920 --> 40:06.640
Which is why I-I leapt at the chance
to meet with you,

40:07.600 --> 40:11.000
even if it is just for ten minutes,
that I might ask...

40:13.280 --> 40:14.320
[exhales]

40:20.040 --> 40:21.960
what your thoughts were...

40:23.840 --> 40:24.840
out there.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.680
Neil?

40:30.840 --> 40:31.920
Well, uh...

40:32.320 --> 40:36.160
obviously a sense of relief
that we executed the mission successfully.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.120
No, of course.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.440
And we certainly got some amazing views,
didn't we?

40:40.760 --> 40:42.800
-Yeah, we did.
-Yes, extraordinary.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.080
I think I'm not talking so much about...

40:46.080 --> 40:48.840
the views in that sense, as...

40:50.280 --> 40:51.480
perspectives,

40:52.200 --> 40:53.800
observations of...

40:54.680 --> 40:57.240
of our place.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.440
Uh...

41:02.240 --> 41:04.280
To be honest,
there wasn't much time for that.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.400
Um...

41:06.360 --> 41:10.720
As a pilot, you'll know
what they drill into you above all else

41:10.800 --> 41:13.920
-is protocol and, uh, procedure.
-Hmm.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.200
-You've got to stick to the rules.
-Yes.

41:16.280 --> 41:20.000
-Well, as an astronaut, it's double that.
-Hm-hmm.

41:20.080 --> 41:23.600
We pretty much spent our entire time
with lists in our hands,

41:23.680 --> 41:24.960
ticking things off.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.440
Tick, check, tick, check.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.400
[Collins] Eyes are glued
to the mission protocol to such a degree

41:29.480 --> 41:31.040
you never really get to look outside.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.880
-That's how busy they keep you.
-I see.

41:32.960 --> 41:33.960
[Aldrin] Tight leash.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.360
[Collins] Not to mention
most of the time you're so darn tired.

41:36.440 --> 41:39.400
No matter how hard you practice,
you never get used to the sleep.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.000
Sleep.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.240
Neil, uh, why don't you tell
His Royal Highness

41:45.320 --> 41:47.040
about what happened after the moonwalk?

41:50.240 --> 41:52.520
-I would love to hear.
-[Collins] He wants to hear it.

41:53.240 --> 41:54.160
[chuckles]

41:55.120 --> 42:00.160
-Well, after I completed the moonwalk--
-I-I watched it all. Every step.

42:00.240 --> 42:01.120
[chuckling]

42:01.200 --> 42:03.840
I got back into the module,

42:03.920 --> 42:06.240
and knew we only had a few hours

42:06.320 --> 42:09.400
to get some rest
before we took off again, so I...

42:09.960 --> 42:13.160
-I got my head down, I closed my eyes...
-Wait for it.

42:13.920 --> 42:17.080
But all I could hear was this noise.
Bang, bang.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.600
Bang, bang.

42:18.680 --> 42:21.000
-What?
-Bang, bang, bang.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.840
What, from outside the module?

42:22.920 --> 42:25.160
-I know. You know what it was?
-What?

42:27.000 --> 42:28.400
-The water cooler.
-[chuckles]

42:29.200 --> 42:31.600
[Armstrong] It was making this noise.
Bang, bang, bang.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.560
[chuckling]

42:35.600 --> 42:38.600
The greatest engineers in the world
design a rocket that takes us to the moon,

42:38.680 --> 42:40.840
but they can't even get us
a decent water cooler.

42:40.920 --> 42:43.600
-[chuckling]
-So you were right.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.720
-It was full of surprises.
-[Armstrong] Hmm.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.280
I see.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.360
Were there any other questions
you had for us?

43:07.720 --> 43:09.440
No. No, it's...

43:11.120 --> 43:14.920
[Collins] Well, in that case, would you
mind if we asked you a few questions?

43:15.000 --> 43:16.080
No, of course.

43:17.640 --> 43:18.640
What is it like?

43:20.160 --> 43:21.080
What is what like?

43:21.720 --> 43:23.600
Living in a place like this.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.520
Because we heard you had a thousand rooms.

43:25.600 --> 43:28.240
And that if you add the lengths
of all the corridors together,

43:28.320 --> 43:31.320
-it comes to... four miles.
-Uh, well...

43:31.400 --> 43:33.800
Is it true you have a bagpiper
for an alarm clock?

43:33.880 --> 43:35.920
And how many staff
do you have here anyway?

43:36.000 --> 43:39.080
And how many palaces? We heard... it's 12.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.560
[Collins] And do you know all these people
in the pictures?

43:41.640 --> 43:43.600
Are you related to those people?

43:43.920 --> 43:45.880
Do the dogs sleep in the room with you?

43:52.600 --> 43:55.640
That's mine. Thank you.
Race you to the top.

43:55.720 --> 43:58.920
-[Aldrin] Go!
-[chuckling]

44:00.240 --> 44:01.240
[Aldrin] No!

44:01.960 --> 44:03.880
-Yes!
-[Armstrong] It was a close call.

44:06.840 --> 44:08.280
[Aldrin] One, two, three.

44:08.360 --> 44:10.040
[all] Cheese!

44:10.120 --> 44:11.160
[cameras click]

44:12.680 --> 44:13.760
[Armstrong] One more.

44:14.760 --> 44:15.840
[cameras click]

44:15.920 --> 44:17.920
[Philip]
I don't know what I was thinking.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.520
I expected them to be... giants, gods.

44:22.520 --> 44:25.280
In reality,
they were just three little men.

44:25.920 --> 44:27.880
Pale-faced, with colds.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.640
[Elizabeth] I have some sympathy.

44:31.160 --> 44:33.520
The very qualities
that made them perfect for the job.

44:33.600 --> 44:36.360
But their lack of flair or imagination.

44:36.440 --> 44:39.360
Their sense of duty,
and modesty and reliability.

44:39.440 --> 44:43.320
Total absence of originality
or spontaneity.

44:43.400 --> 44:46.000
But that's what makes them
perfect in a crisis.

44:46.080 --> 44:49.280
And entirely anticlimactic
when you meet them in person.

44:51.800 --> 44:52.880
I mean, imagine.

44:53.560 --> 44:56.360
They go all that way to the moon
and stay healthy,

44:56.440 --> 44:58.200
but one trip to London nearly kills them.

44:58.280 --> 44:59.320
[dog barks]

45:01.600 --> 45:02.920
It's not their fault.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.480
They never wanted to be public figures,

45:06.080 --> 45:09.000
and now, because of one event,
they will be forever.

45:09.480 --> 45:11.920
Hmm. They delivered as astronauts, but...

45:13.440 --> 45:15.240
they disappointed as human beings.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.960
They'll spend the rest of their lives
in goldfish bowls...

45:22.720 --> 45:24.440
scared to open their mouths,

45:24.960 --> 45:27.240
knowing it could reveal
who they actually are,

45:27.320 --> 45:29.400
and that they will inevitably disappoint.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.760
And for that, they deserve our pity.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.680
Good job there were no little green men.

45:38.840 --> 45:42.960
They could be forgiven for thinking, "If
that's all planet Earth has got to offer,

45:43.040 --> 45:44.560
let's give the place a miss."

45:44.920 --> 45:45.920
[scoffs]

45:46.560 --> 45:47.600
Hmm.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.640
[clock chimes]

46:28.480 --> 46:30.560
[clock ticks]

46:57.640 --> 47:01.800
[Philip] There wasn't a specific moment,
uh, when it started.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.560
It's been more of a gradual thing.

47:05.240 --> 47:09.640
A drip, drip, drip of... of doubt...

47:11.320 --> 47:12.400
disaffection,

47:13.120 --> 47:16.200
disease, dis... discomfort.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.400
People around me have noticed
my general...

47:21.440 --> 47:22.880
uh, irritability.

47:22.960 --> 47:23.880
Um...

47:25.160 --> 47:28.040
Now, of course,
that's... that's nothing new.

47:28.120 --> 47:31.640
I'm... generally a cantankerous sort,

47:31.760 --> 47:35.960
but even I would have to admit that
there has been more of it lately.

47:37.120 --> 47:41.560
Not to mention,
uh, an almost jealous fascination

47:41.640 --> 47:44.600
with the achievements
of these young astronauts.

47:46.480 --> 47:48.480
Compulsive overexercising.

47:49.280 --> 47:52.520
An inability to find calm...

47:54.400 --> 47:55.680
or satisfaction...

47:57.280 --> 47:58.400
or fulfillment.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.080
And when you look
at all these symptoms,

48:03.160 --> 48:06.640
of course it doesn't take a genius
to tell you that...

48:07.240 --> 48:11.400
they all suggest
I'm slap bang in the middle of a...

48:15.160 --> 48:16.960
[chuckles]

48:19.040 --> 48:23.440
I can't even say what kind of crisis.

48:23.520 --> 48:24.600
[chuckling]

48:24.680 --> 48:27.640
That... that crisis.

48:28.440 --> 48:29.360
And...

48:29.760 --> 48:32.920
Of course one's read or heard about
other people hitting that crisis,

48:33.000 --> 48:36.720
and, you know, just like them,
you look in all the usual places,

48:36.920 --> 48:40.880
resort to all the usual things
to try and make yourself feel better.

48:42.400 --> 48:43.280
Uh...

48:44.480 --> 48:46.640
Some of which I can admit to in this room,

48:46.720 --> 48:49.480
and some of which I probably shouldn't.

48:56.840 --> 48:59.000
My mother died recently.

49:04.920 --> 49:05.880
[clears throat]

49:11.520 --> 49:14.840
She... she saw that something was amiss.

49:17.560 --> 49:19.280
It's a good word, that.

49:21.080 --> 49:22.400
A-Amiss.

49:22.480 --> 49:27.320
She saw that something was missing
in her youngest child.

49:27.840 --> 49:28.880
Her only son.

49:32.840 --> 49:33.880
Faith.

49:38.360 --> 49:40.280
"How's your faith?" she asked me.

49:47.160 --> 49:49.760
I'm here to admit to you that...

49:50.640 --> 49:51.680
I've lost it.

49:55.520 --> 49:56.440
And...

49:57.280 --> 49:58.840
without it, what is there?

50:02.160 --> 50:03.200
The...

50:06.520 --> 50:07.760
The loneliness

50:08.720 --> 50:11.920
and emptiness and anticlimax

50:12.760 --> 50:15.240
of going all that way to the moon

50:15.920 --> 50:19.680
to find nothing,
but haunting desolation...

50:21.560 --> 50:23.040
ghostly silence...

50:24.320 --> 50:25.560
gloom.

50:27.280 --> 50:29.080
That is what faithlessness is.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.400
As opposed to finding...

50:35.680 --> 50:38.200
wonder, ecstasy, the miracle of...

50:39.280 --> 50:43.440
divine creation, God's design and purpose.

50:46.040 --> 50:48.040
What am I trying to say?

50:49.440 --> 50:50.960
I'm trying to say that...

50:52.280 --> 50:54.560
the solution to our problems,

50:55.360 --> 50:57.840
I think, is not in the...

50:58.440 --> 51:03.120
in the ingenuity of the rocket,
or the science or the technology or...

51:04.200 --> 51:05.440
even the bravery.

51:09.600 --> 51:11.160
No, the answer is in here.

51:15.320 --> 51:19.800
Or here, or wherever it is
that... that faith resides.

51:23.960 --> 51:26.680
And so... Dean Woods...

51:28.960 --> 51:32.240
having ridiculed you for what you

51:32.320 --> 51:37.040
and these poor, blocked, lost souls...

51:37.120 --> 51:38.760
[chuckling]

51:39.240 --> 51:43.680
...were... were trying to achieve here
in St. George's House...

51:45.680 --> 51:48.320
I now find myself full of respect...

51:49.760 --> 51:50.920
and admiration...

51:53.000 --> 51:55.400
and not a small part of...

51:56.400 --> 51:57.440
desperation...

52:00.840 --> 52:02.520
as I come to say...

52:06.440 --> 52:07.360
help.

52:12.840 --> 52:13.880
Help me.

52:23.520 --> 52:27.840
And to admit... [chuckles]
that while those three astronauts

52:27.920 --> 52:31.440
deserve all our praise and respect
for their undoubted heroism,

52:31.520 --> 52:33.840
I was more scared
coming here to see you today

52:33.920 --> 52:36.560
than I would have been
going up in any bloody rocket!

52:36.640 --> 52:38.640
[chuckling]

52:40.200 --> 52:41.280
[clears throat]

52:53.200 --> 52:55.200
[birds chirp]

53:10.120 --> 53:11.880
[indistinct chatter]

53:17.880 --> 53:19.880
[dogs bark]
