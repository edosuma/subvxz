WEBVTT

04:02.492 --> 04:05.245
You stopped the ship.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.454
Oh.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.206
Saved our lives.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.000
Now it's time to go home.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.008
We almost have the ring rebalanced.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.135
Give me one more cycle.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.221
What about the crew?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.473
I'm their captain now.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.398
You gave me back my life.

04:35.608 --> 04:36.442
My home.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.661
When can we be together?

04:48.037 --> 04:48.871
Soon.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.749
Finish the repairs.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.127
Then we'll have time.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.681
None of my business, Chief.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.284
Who are you?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.413
Everything was a lie.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.208
I trusted you.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.466
I loved you.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.477
What did I love, Roy?

05:55.271 --> 05:56.355
What did I love?

06:04.238 --> 06:05.615
Cynthia.

06:05.698 --> 06:11.537
Watch out.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.333
Girl.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.795
She...

06:18.878 --> 06:22.507
Not me.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.676
Karl.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.180
Cynthia Eris is back.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.224
I just saw her...

06:32.391 --> 06:33.267
as a projection.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.602
I was on Deck 7.

06:35.144 --> 06:35.978
It must mean

06:36.062 --> 06:37.855
-that she's gaining access to the systems.
-Damn it!

06:37.939 --> 06:39.524
Lommie never locked her away,
not all of her.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.234
She left a part of her out, a little girl.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.444
And she's influencing people on this ship.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.446
It's an anomaly.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.741
Lommie.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.535
You okay?

06:51.452 --> 06:52.745
I was, uh...

06:53.162 --> 06:55.123
I was inside the Crystal when...

06:55.873 --> 06:57.834
when the dome blew. I...

06:59.335 --> 07:00.378
I couldn't get out.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.297
What about Cynthia?

07:04.340 --> 07:06.134
Mel thinks part of her might be free.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.430
No. The girl was just a fragment.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.724
I cleared all that up.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.311
And made sure the firewalls were secure.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.605
-When? Because I just saw her.
-When I was down there.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.401
She's gone. This time for good.

07:25.486 --> 07:26.320
Okay.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.573
Karl.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.285
Can we just go back now?

07:32.702 --> 07:33.911
People have died.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.374
The ship is damaged.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.085
What can that thing possibly tell us?

07:41.169 --> 07:42.795
The Volcryn can change everything.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.464
They can change our entire world.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.340
-You really believe that?
-With all my heart.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.341
Things I've seen,

07:47.425 --> 07:49.135
what I've been able to do because of them.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.344
What exactly did you see?

07:50.428 --> 07:52.180
Different realities, different dimensions.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.265
The Volcryn are the key, the Teke energy,

07:54.348 --> 07:57.226
-they can open doors for us.
-Teke made you crazy.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.353
Lommie!

07:59.604 --> 08:03.941
The machine I built in the memory sphere
is only a fraction of what they can do.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.319
Go see for yourself.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.328
What about you?

08:17.246 --> 08:19.373
I don't want everything we've lost
to be for nothing.

08:19.957 --> 08:20.917
We need to use Thale.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.960
I know,
but it almost killed him last time.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.672
It's too strong,
and I don't know how to make him filter.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.884
Well, Rowan trained him.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.596
He did it with the bees, with the rabbit.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.182
I'm going to go talk to Rowan.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.142
He's the only one
that can guide Thale through.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.143
Karl.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.146
Rowan killed people.

08:43.814 --> 08:44.941
We can't trust him.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.236
I'm just going to talk to him, that's all.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.589
Begin playback.

09:18.015 --> 09:18.849
Auggie.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.230
Take us home, please.

09:27.483 --> 09:30.361
I'm sorry.
You're not the captain anymore.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.455
Give that thing...

09:43.749 --> 09:44.750
to me.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.381
Auggie, stop!

10:08.733 --> 10:11.902
What have you done to my ship?

10:12.695 --> 10:13.946
It's bleeding.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.657
Infecting us.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.714
Rowan?

10:42.600 --> 10:43.476
Rowan?

10:45.811 --> 10:47.772
Look, Rowan, I don't know
what happened to you,

10:47.855 --> 10:50.441
and I don't know why you did what you did,
but I want you to know

10:50.524 --> 10:52.443
that Agatha's dead.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.031
She killed herself.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.125
Rowan?

11:16.592 --> 11:20.179
She did it for Thale,
to release him from the psychic feedback.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.350
She did it for you.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.396
How do you know?

11:34.485 --> 11:35.736
I was there.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.659
I don't remember it all. It was too much.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.911
The Teke was amplifying everything.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.913
It was too fucking much!

11:48.207 --> 11:49.667
It was too much.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.379
I'm so sorry, mate.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.423
I'm so sorry about Agatha.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.095
Because I can only guess
how much you loved her.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.311
Karl, listen.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.898
I've been studying the Volcryn.

12:14.358 --> 12:18.320
This shift in morphology
could actually be your invitation.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.406
They may want to communicate.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.910
I could help you.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.581
Now that the feedback loop's broken,

12:28.664 --> 12:32.001
Thale can do
what we brought him here to do.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.230
Is that you?

14:06.303 --> 14:07.388
Where are you?

14:25.072 --> 14:25.990
Roy?

14:28.117 --> 14:29.243
Can you hear me?

14:43.173 --> 14:44.633
The door.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.433
Use...

14:54.268 --> 14:55.686
eye.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.584
Access denied.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.603
Casualties have been triaged, Chief.

15:38.896 --> 15:39.980
We lost six.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.525
Another eight or nine
are cycling through Re-Gen now.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.530
-How long until we're operational?
-Well, I've got the ballast moving now.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.200
Give me, say, eight hours
and we'll be able to test rotation.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.535
Stay on the boys down there.
The sooner, the better.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.703
Auggie.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.289
I need to talk to you.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.000
You're not supposed to be here.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.419
I need to talk to you.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.468
That thing out there has infected us.

16:09.551 --> 16:12.179
It's bleeding, it's spreading,
it's going up the walls!

16:12.262 --> 16:13.639
-Cynthia, calm down.
-What?

16:13.722 --> 16:16.600
I will not be calm, not on my ship!

16:17.226 --> 16:20.854
This thing is eating through
the Nightflyer like a cancer.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.192
If they find out you're alive,
we'll have a mutiny.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.403
Let me get us to Europa,
then you take the ship,

16:27.486 --> 16:28.654
you can have control again.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.781
We won't make it to Europa.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.492
Even if we did,
that thing will contaminate my colonies,

16:33.575 --> 16:35.828
everything I've built, everything I am.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.122
There's only one way to stop it.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.541
I need you...

16:41.458 --> 16:43.377
to disable the cooling system.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.546
-The thrusters?
-Let them go critical.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.506
The explosion would be catastrophic.

16:48.048 --> 16:51.802
-Our entire crew, our ship...
-Yes, but the blast would vaporize it.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.095
We could kill it.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.560
I have a life pod on Deck 7.

17:03.313 --> 17:04.606
You'd take me with you?

17:04.940 --> 17:06.483
Of course, little bear.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.902
We could start over.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.657
Its membrane appears thinnest
at its center.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.661
It's acting like
a flexible conductive sheath.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.080
Movements are becoming receptive.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.167
Those tentacles are reacting
to our every movement and presence.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.835
So, clearly, it knows that we're here.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.173
Thale.

17:30.632 --> 17:31.675
Where is he?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.511
You fucking bastard!

17:35.763 --> 17:36.972
What are you doing?

17:37.639 --> 17:38.682
Stop.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.809
Stop! Karl, make him stop.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.478
You were there when she died.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.230
I'm sorry.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.904
Thale. Thale!

17:51.987 --> 17:52.821
Stop, you'll kill him!

17:56.116 --> 17:58.452
He's the only one who understands
how the Volcryn works.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.204
I need him.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.461
I need to talk to you.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.421
Alone.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.144
This is all in my head?

18:24.812 --> 18:26.063
I'm stronger now.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.609
Since Agatha left us,
all the Teke became focused on me.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.655
I can hear the Volcryn.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.575
And they're waiting for you.
They want you to come to them.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.787
Thale, how do I get over there?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.000
Cynthia Eris.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.921
I don't understand.
Cynthia's inside the Crystal.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.631
No, she ain't. She's on the ship.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.928
She stole Lommie's body.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.391
She's got a way off the ship.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.017
Some form of life raft.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.563
Yeah. That's your ticket, mate.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.983
That's how you get to the Volcryn.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.329
What just happened?

19:24.538 --> 19:25.664
We need to find Lommie.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.040
I've been trying.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.418
She's somewhere dark and hot.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.962
I can't get a full image.

19:32.296 --> 19:35.048
The engine rooms, below Deck 7.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.428
I need you to stay with Thale,
help him focus on Lommie.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.054
We're running out of time.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.765
I'll explain.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.982
Karl, whatever happens.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.277
-Good luck.
-Yeah.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.281
You want to get going, bruv,
there ain't much time.

20:57.464 --> 21:00.259
Captain Roy Eris,
identity confirmed.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.522
Chief, you shouldn't be in here.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.157
The ship is overheating.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.701
I'm aware of that, Murph.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.703
You're going to send the thrusters
into meltdown!

21:27.786 --> 21:30.414
Get back to your station.
Look, I'll handle the thrusters.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.417
Just like you handled the pressure sensors
in the Terraform Dome?

21:35.836 --> 21:37.838
You're relieved of your duties, Murph.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.257
Silas can take over your shift.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.096
There's not going to be any more shifts,
are there, Chief?

21:49.891 --> 21:50.767
No.

23:31.409 --> 23:32.285
Roy?

23:32.911 --> 23:34.037
Is that really you?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.137
Roy.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.239
You two were made for each other.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.537
Genetic freaks.

24:16.705 --> 24:17.914
Mistakes.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.126
Blended with...

24:21.209 --> 24:23.461
...occasional strokes of genius.

24:25.005 --> 24:25.839
Lommie?

24:26.423 --> 24:27.966
Lommie is gone.

24:28.675 --> 24:32.137
Locked in the Crystal Matrix
with my father.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.639
-You selfish bitch.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.893
This ship, everything you built,
was for yourself.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.605
So what

24:42.272 --> 24:43.523
What about him?

24:43.607 --> 24:44.816
What about his life?

24:45.358 --> 24:46.193
Roy loves you.

24:46.693 --> 24:49.738
-It tore him apart to put you...
-To what?

24:49.821 --> 24:52.824
To lock me away
inside that crystal prison?

24:55.869 --> 24:57.078
Not very nice,

24:58.580 --> 25:00.373
considering I made him myself.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.042
What do you mean, "made"?

25:02.375 --> 25:06.463
I have devised the ability
to live past my body's natural life,

25:07.005 --> 25:10.467
but only physical beings
have rights in our society.

25:11.968 --> 25:15.138
I needed an heir
to keep flying my ship,

25:15.222 --> 25:16.806
building my colonies.

25:17.432 --> 25:20.435
Roy is a cross-sex clone...

25:21.645 --> 25:22.520
of myself.

25:25.190 --> 25:28.401
You did something to him, Mel.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.153
You treated him like a...

25:31.780 --> 25:32.739
person.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.159
No one ever had before,

25:38.453 --> 25:40.997
not even me.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.795
Of course, he could never love you.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.589
Not in a real way.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.343
I was never as skilled as Connie.

25:55.637 --> 25:56.513
Connie Brighthead?

25:56.846 --> 25:58.265
She never mentioned to you

25:58.348 --> 26:00.558
where the root DNA
for your coding came from?

26:04.062 --> 26:05.230
My parents...

26:06.439 --> 26:07.274
They,

26:07.524 --> 26:09.150
they donated genetic material.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.777
-I was enhanced from...
-There's a reason...

26:13.363 --> 26:17.409
There's a reason you and Roy are so close.

26:19.536 --> 26:20.537
You're both...

26:22.122 --> 26:23.206
a part of me.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.419
You're his sister, I suppose.

26:34.342 --> 26:37.137
It's fitting you'll be together
for these final moments.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.640
Goodbye, my children.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.279
Warning! Thruster temperature critical.

26:54.946 --> 26:59.034
Core integrity compromised
in T-minus 20 minutes.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.519
She's in her room below Deck 7.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.986
She's behind you, the other way.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.409
Fuck! No, fuck this, man.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.620
It's too close to the engines.
It's too hot. It's too loud.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.205
It's too hot? It can't burn you.

27:45.955 --> 27:47.290
Ignore the noise.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.000
Push through it.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.043
Fucking hell.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.545
Come on, Thale. You can do this.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.183
That's it, Thale.
Tell me, what do you see?

28:07.394 --> 28:08.728
I can see her in her room.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.980
It looks like Lommie,
but it fucking ain't.

28:12.148 --> 28:13.024
She's leaving.

28:13.608 --> 28:16.027
-Okay, now lead Karl to her.
-Okay.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.363
I've got this. Take a right.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.532
Down there. Lommie's down there.

28:20.782 --> 28:21.616
Left.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.834
Now, turn around. Behind you.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.569
What the fuck?

29:39.652 --> 29:41.279
Come on, man! She's right behind you!

29:42.197 --> 29:43.740
Fucking turn around! Open your eyes!

29:43.823 --> 29:45.366
She's right behind you!
Come on! Turn around!

29:54.626 --> 29:56.419
-You're running away.
-So are you.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.547
Oh, this ship gave you life,
and you're abandoning it.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.466
You ruined all that when bringing us here.

30:01.549 --> 30:04.010
You let that thing infect the Nightflyer.

30:04.093 --> 30:06.513
No. You're the infection.

30:13.561 --> 30:16.606
Kill me and Lommie has no body.

30:16.689 --> 30:19.192
You're strangling your friend.

30:32.038 --> 30:35.124
You leave this ship,
and all your friends are going to die.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.042
No, they won't.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.710
I'm leaving you here with them.

30:41.172 --> 30:43.383
You're crazy! Where are you going to go?

30:43.466 --> 30:44.509
I'm going home.

30:48.721 --> 30:49.681
No!

30:50.598 --> 30:51.474
No!

30:52.809 --> 30:55.186
No!

31:00.316 --> 31:04.112
Launch sequence begins in ten seconds.

31:05.822 --> 31:07.323
Ten, nine,

31:07.824 --> 31:10.660
-eight, seven, six,
-That's it.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.412
five, four,

31:12.704 --> 31:15.290
-three, two, one.
-Come on.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.418
No!

31:52.452 --> 31:53.786
-What?
-Warning!

31:54.162 --> 31:56.080
-Thruster temperature critical.
-What is that?

31:56.164 --> 32:00.418
Core integrity compromised
in T-minus 14 minutes.

32:00.543 --> 32:01.628
That's D'Branin.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.838
He's going to make contact?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.385
Which means we need to save this ship.

32:29.447 --> 32:33.159
He took the pod, Auggie. We're trapped.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.787
We're going to die out here.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.038
You went down without me?

32:37.997 --> 32:38.915
I was waiting for you.

32:40.124 --> 32:40.959
Auggie.

32:42.877 --> 32:47.048
The pod was made for one person.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.218
It was designed for me.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.806
This is my legacy.

32:54.889 --> 32:58.267
It's my talents that created this ship.

32:58.935 --> 33:02.563
You are just a glorified truck driver.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.861
Get Lommie off the bridge.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.240
-You can't do this.
-Lock her in her quarters and sedate her.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.409
-This is my ship.
-She's unstable. Get her out now!

33:18.121 --> 33:19.747
This is my ship!

33:20.832 --> 33:23.584
You can't do this! This is my ship!

34:01.205 --> 34:02.331
You fucking coward!

34:03.249 --> 34:05.043
You don't get to take the easy way out!

34:05.752 --> 34:07.962
You're the captain now,
and we need your help.

34:09.505 --> 34:11.591
It's over. There's no hope.

34:12.258 --> 34:14.010
Well, I didn't come out here to die.

34:15.845 --> 34:18.931
Now, you listen to me,
you're going to help us fix this.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.145
The cooling system has been disabled.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.148
I can't get the engines...

34:28.357 --> 34:29.400
to stop overheating.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.781
Wait a minute.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.575
If we reset the thrusters,

34:37.658 --> 34:39.410
it would bring the cooling system
back online.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.205
It's not possible
to shut down the entire ship.

34:42.288 --> 34:43.831
The Nightflyer is programmed
with fail safes

34:43.915 --> 34:45.666
to keep the environmental systems online.

34:48.419 --> 34:49.879
Unless you did it from the inside.

34:50.129 --> 34:51.672
-Warning!
-I don't understand.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.091
Thruster temperature critical.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.134
-Lommie.
-Core integrity compromised

34:55.218 --> 34:56.803
in T-minus eight minutes.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.472
We would lose everything,
heat, oxygen, any form of controls.

34:59.555 --> 35:02.433
That's better than four simultaneous
nuclear explosions.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.811
We don't have time to build a tether.
We can't get to her.

35:06.604 --> 35:07.897
I know someone who can.

36:01.868 --> 36:02.994
Can you do it or not?

36:03.369 --> 36:05.079
-Oh, do we have a choice?
-No.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.456
If you can't reach Lommie, we're all dead.

36:08.541 --> 36:11.085
-You did it earlier.
-That's a bit different, innit, mate?

36:11.169 --> 36:13.421
The Crystal's way more complex
than a couple of tunnels.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.048
He's never going to be able
to find her in there, not enough time.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.258
We'll see about that, won't we?

36:17.633 --> 36:18.676
Truck driver.

36:19.594 --> 36:22.305
Warning. Thruster temperature critical.

36:23.222 --> 36:27.310
Core integrity compromised
in T-minus five minutes.

36:36.777 --> 36:37.778
It's too much.

36:55.922 --> 36:56.839
Mel.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.301
I'm sorry.

37:03.554 --> 37:04.430
Lommie?

37:06.015 --> 37:07.099
I can hear you, but...

37:08.100 --> 37:09.560
I don't know where I am.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.354
We need your help.

37:12.146 --> 37:13.898
We need you to shut down the Nightflyer.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.235
The Crystal. If it loses power...

37:17.318 --> 37:19.570
We're going to restart the ship.
We won't let you die in there.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.448
It's okay if I do.

37:24.533 --> 37:25.534
We'll try something else.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.036
Look, I can do this.

37:28.037 --> 37:30.331
-It doesn't matter what happens to me.
-Yes, it does.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.541
You were right.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.002
The connections we make,

37:36.879 --> 37:37.755
they're everything.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.217
I love you, Mel.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.303
I always will.

37:48.849 --> 37:49.767
Lommie?

37:50.851 --> 37:53.145
All right, that's enough of all that
soppy bollocks, innit?

37:53.938 --> 37:55.064
Yeah, she's gone.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.151
Let's have everyone gather into groups,

37:59.777 --> 38:02.154
try to create a heat sink,
insulate our bodies.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.740
We won't have much time
before she shuts the ship down.

38:05.032 --> 38:07.743
Warning! Thruster temperature critical.

38:07.827 --> 38:11.664
Core integrity compromised
in T-minus three minutes.

38:12.081 --> 38:15.418
All Deck 4 personnel,
please report to the Inner Core.

38:15.751 --> 38:19.088
All Deck 2 personnel,
please report to the Mess Hall.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.173
Get to the Mess Hall.
Bring everything to the Mess Hall.

38:21.340 --> 38:24.302
Warning! Thruster meltdown imminent.

38:24.385 --> 38:25.261
This way.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.515
Everyone, huddle together!

38:29.598 --> 38:33.477
Core integrity compromised
in T-minus two minutes.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.896
Stay close. Stay close to keep warm.

38:42.194 --> 38:43.446
Attention!

38:44.447 --> 38:47.408
Full system shutdown in ten,

38:49.327 --> 38:50.161
nine,

38:51.370 --> 38:52.204
eight,

38:53.873 --> 38:54.707
seven,

38:56.292 --> 38:57.543
six,

38:58.794 --> 38:59.754
five,

39:01.255 --> 39:02.089
four,

39:03.674 --> 39:04.800
three,

39:06.177 --> 39:07.136
two,

39:08.346 --> 39:09.305
one.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.683
Full system shutdown.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.817
Good afternoon, Professor.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.570
I have a proposal for you.

39:26.489 --> 39:29.784
My ship was designed
to explore new worlds.

39:30.659 --> 39:34.497
It was built to expand the human horizon
across the solar system.

39:35.581 --> 39:36.957
But this discovery,

39:37.917 --> 39:42.004
this singular opportunity to make contact
with a higher power,

39:42.713 --> 39:45.132
to pursue a knowledge beyond our own.

39:46.342 --> 39:50.429
A knowledge that could unlock
our potential and save mankind itself.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.519
This is the Eris legacy.

39:59.105 --> 40:01.148
And the Nightflyer can take you there.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.275
...the spread of celiovirus
across all nations.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.402
This is the epicenter of...

41:19.560 --> 41:20.686
Daddy, you're home.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.067
Yeah, baby.

41:31.572 --> 41:32.490
I'm home.

41:38.871 --> 41:39.788
I'm home.
