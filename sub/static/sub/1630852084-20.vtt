07:30.225 --> 07:32.260
I can whip something up for
you, you can take it with you,

07:32.361 --> 07:33.462
okay?
- JEREMY: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

07:33.562 --> 07:36.598
- You talking about food?

07:36.698 --> 07:39.601
- Yes, Mr. Brown, you said
you were hungry, right?

07:39.701 --> 07:42.471

07:42.571 --> 07:44.206
No, I'm good. I'm good.

07:44.272 --> 07:46.508

- No, I ate, um...

07:46.608 --> 07:48.477
- LEAH: Said you was hungry.
- No, I ate...

07:48.577 --> 07:51.213
four days ago.
It was good.

07:51.313 --> 07:54.216
- Mr. Brown, you sure?
- I'm good.

07:54.316 --> 07:56.151
I'm good.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.154
- Okay. Alright, okay.

07:59.221 --> 08:01.356
- Alright, kids, y'all

08:01.456 --> 08:04.593
- It's my pleasure.

08:04.693 --> 08:09.398
- Suh, this kid.
- [chuckles] What?

08:09.498 --> 08:11.300
- He really is a nice kid.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.337
- I know but, baby, he
eats a lot.

08:15.437 --> 08:16.571
- Well, damn.

08:16.672 --> 08:19.908
That wasn't even his bread.
- [gasps]

08:20.008 --> 08:21.176
Oh my God.

08:21.276 --> 08:22.744
- Sandra, will you help me?

08:23.845 --> 08:26.515
- Is there another
Sandra in here?

08:26.615 --> 08:29.184
- Come on, it'll be fun.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.486
- Okay. [giggles]

08:31.586 --> 08:33.221
Okay.
- Did she giggle?

08:33.322 --> 08:35.724
She giggled.

08:35.824 --> 08:37.926
- This kid is really making
me like him.

08:38.026 --> 08:41.797
- I know. Is that my daughter
back there doing the dishes?

08:41.897 --> 08:43.832
- Yes.

08:43.932 --> 08:46.668
- Oh my gosh, baby, can we keep
him? Can we keep him, please?

08:46.768 --> 08:49.504
- Uh, you sure you wanna
do that?

08:49.604 --> 08:51.440
- Why, Grandpa?
Why you say that?

08:51.540 --> 08:52.708
- That boy steals.

08:52.808 --> 08:54.009
- What are you talking
about?

08:54.142 --> 08:55.644
- You ain't see all that bread
he was putting

08:55.744 --> 08:58.814
in his pant's pocket?
I mean, just bread.

08:58.914 --> 09:00.382
Anybody bread he on--
- What?

09:00.482 --> 09:02.150
- Eating bread, putting
bread in his pocket, yes.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.686
- No, I didn't see that.
- Yeah.

09:04.786 --> 09:06.421
- Well, he was eating a lot.

09:06.521 --> 09:09.524
- I know, that's what I'm
trying to tell you.

09:09.625 --> 09:10.592
- You thinking what I'm
thinking?

09:10.692 --> 09:13.028
- The exact same thing.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.997
This is the first time we've
been on the same page

09:15.163 --> 09:16.665
since you've been here, son.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.167
We seeing eye to eye
about that boy.

09:19.201 --> 09:20.235
- Okay.
- I mean, I'm thinking

09:20.335 --> 09:23.071
what you thinking.
We are one mind combined.

09:23.171 --> 09:24.373
- And what am I thinking?

09:24.473 --> 09:26.174
- That boy gonna have
a yeast infection.

09:28.810 --> 09:31.246
I mean, they're gonna have
to shoot him in both cheeks

09:31.346 --> 09:33.815
with something real strong.

09:33.915 --> 09:37.519
And then salve all up
in this area here.

09:37.619 --> 09:38.820
- Did you really just
say that?

09:38.920 --> 09:40.756
- Look, I'm grown.
I say what I want to.

09:40.856 --> 09:42.391
But y'all need to get him
to the doctor,

09:42.491 --> 09:46.094
'cause something gonna
fall off.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.096
- That's disgusting.

09:48.196 --> 09:51.433
- Baby?
- Yeah?

09:51.533 --> 09:53.702
- You think he's eating?

09:53.802 --> 09:56.405
- I don't, and I met
his father, so...

09:56.505 --> 09:58.173
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's not.

09:58.273 --> 10:01.476
- [sighs]
What do we do?

10:01.576 --> 10:03.879
- Well, we could
talk to him.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.848
- Yeah, this baby is
being abused, Jeremy.

10:06.949 --> 10:09.251
- Now, now, come on, baby,
let's not go that far.

10:09.351 --> 10:10.752
- Something is not right,
Jeremy.

10:10.852 --> 10:12.821
I watched that boy
eat tonight.

10:12.921 --> 10:15.657
And he has not eaten
in a long time.

put his hands

11:26.877 --> 11:28.379
back on his daddy.
- No, you will not.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.181

Okay, no, don't do that.
You know, you abuse your kids.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.122

12:17.862 --> 12:19.897
- How you be eating
that girl's food?

12:19.997 --> 12:24.035
- Well, I smoke a lot of weed,
so it helps with my nausea.

12:24.135 --> 12:25.002
- See?
- Man.

12:25.102 --> 12:27.672
- His stomach's stronger
than mine.

12:27.772 --> 12:29.640
- That's 'cause your stomach
is coated with chocolate milk

12:29.740 --> 12:32.276
and grits.
- Ooh!

12:32.376 --> 12:33.744
It might be true.
- VINNY: Mm-hmm.

12:33.844 --> 12:37.148
- For that reason, I'm out.

12:37.248 --> 12:39.617
- For that reason,
I'm glad.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.652

12:50.561 --> 12:51.862
- Alright, y'all need
to be careful.

12:51.963 --> 12:53.864
- Why we need to be
careful?

12:53.965 --> 12:56.601
- I mean, that boy daddy
is the sheriff.

12:56.701 --> 12:58.736
- We know who he is,
Grandpa.

12:58.836 --> 13:01.606
- And your husband's
scared of him.

13:01.706 --> 13:03.174
- Baby, you said
you put him out.

13:03.274 --> 13:06.911

13:09.780 --> 13:10.881
Let me tell y'all something.

13:10.982 --> 13:12.883
You know he can make it
rough for ya, right?

13:12.984 --> 13:14.218
- How's that?

13:14.318 --> 13:16.687
- Hell, he knows the mayor
and the building inspector.

13:16.787 --> 13:19.056
- Just because he knows
people, Grandpa Vinny,

13:19.156 --> 13:22.059
does that mean we're not
supposed to help this boy?

13:22.159 --> 13:23.494
- Yeah.
- Is that what you saying?

13:23.594 --> 13:24.762
- That--that's exactly
what I'm saying.

13:24.862 --> 13:26.631
- Okay, and what kind of
people would we be if didn't

13:26.731 --> 13:28.232
do anything?
- You would be the kind of

13:28.332 --> 13:31.736
people that would have
their business up and running.

13:31.836 --> 13:35.640
Customers coming in,
cash register. Cha-ching!

13:35.740 --> 13:36.974
- I don't care what you say.

13:37.074 --> 13:39.610
Leah thinks we should
talk to him.

13:39.710 --> 13:40.778
- Okay, let me tell you
something.

13:40.878 --> 13:42.480
If I don't get this place
open 'cause you piss

13:42.546 --> 13:45.082
his daddy off, I'm gonna
talk to you myself.

13:47.151 --> 13:47.885
- Oh.

13:47.985 --> 13:49.520
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.055
With my fist.
- Oh, yeah, you tried

13:51.155 --> 13:53.057
that before.
- Yeah, and that's when you

13:53.157 --> 13:55.927
grabbed me my neck, you
pushed my arm,

13:56.027 --> 13:58.930
and you threw me over the couch.

13:59.030 --> 14:00.398
- Guess what? I'm about to
do it again.

14:00.498 --> 14:01.599
- Help!
Beating an old man!

14:01.699 --> 14:03.000
- Hey, would y'all stop?
- Beating an old man!

14:03.100 --> 14:05.736
- Grandpa Vinny, Jeremy,
please stop it.

14:05.836 --> 14:07.838
Can we talk about
this kid, please?

14:07.939 --> 14:09.674
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, I need to ask y'all

14:09.774 --> 14:12.376
something, 'cause I'm high
and confused.

14:12.510 --> 14:15.780
- Well?
- I'm "hi-fusion."

14:15.880 --> 14:17.748
- Well, this sounds like
a pointless conversation.

14:17.848 --> 14:19.216
- VINNY: It does. It does.

14:19.317 --> 14:23.454
I need to know how y'all went
from wanting to kill this boy

14:23.521 --> 14:26.357
to now, all the sudden,
he the darling in your life?

14:26.457 --> 14:27.658
- [sighs]
- The same way you went

14:27.758 --> 14:29.293
from having a hook to
having two hands again.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.729
- Mm.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.298
- Don't tell that to the
social security office, please.

14:34.465 --> 14:36.200
- Will you stop? We think
he's in trouble, for real.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.469
- Well, damn it, that
ain't your business!

14:38.502 --> 14:40.104
- Honey. [laughs]
- Alright.

14:40.204 --> 14:42.273
Go ahead and talk to him.
Go ahead and talk.

14:42.373 --> 14:44.842
Talk your mouths off.
Just yip, yip, yip, yip.

14:44.942 --> 14:46.043
But I can tell ya what.

14:46.143 --> 14:48.012
It's gonna backfire in
both of your faces.

14:48.112 --> 14:50.214
Boom!
- Yeah, whatever, man.

14:50.314 --> 14:51.249
We got it.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.917
- VINNY: Y'all ain't
got a damn thing.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.256
- He's pissing me off, man.
- Sssh.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.057
- Baby?
- What?

15:00.157 --> 15:01.859
- What do you think
we should do?

15:01.959 --> 15:05.596
- Well, we have to talk
to him.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.031
- But what if he really
is in trouble?

15:07.131 --> 15:09.667
- Then we have to help him,
Jeremy.

15:09.767 --> 15:10.768
- I know.

15:10.868 --> 15:15.506
- I mean, we can't leave
him.

15:15.606 --> 15:18.509
- Yeah, I know that, but
I just--

15:18.542 --> 15:19.777
- What?
- I'm just thinking.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.212
- Thinking what?

15:21.312 --> 15:22.947
I hope you ain't thinking
like your grandfather over here.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.316
- Oh, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

15:25.449 --> 15:28.152
It's just that I met his
father, and he's really

15:28.252 --> 15:30.354
not a good guy.

15:30.454 --> 15:32.156
- Are you really
afraid of him?

15:32.256 --> 15:36.761
- Pffpt! I ain't--uh, buh,
what?

15:36.861 --> 15:38.496
- Well, you just making
noises right now.

15:38.596 --> 15:39.664
- No.
- Are you afraid of him?

15:39.764 --> 15:41.365
- How dare he?

15:41.465 --> 15:43.868
- "How dare he?" Okay.

15:43.968 --> 15:46.070
- No, you know what I do.
You know what I do.

15:46.170 --> 15:47.271
You remember--
- I know, baby.

15:47.371 --> 15:48.873
- You remember when I was
in high school, and--and

15:48.973 --> 15:50.141
the dudes jumped me.
- Right.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.709
- And I beat one of 'em
up though.

15:51.809 --> 15:54.478
- One of 'em. You did,
yeah, the whole black eye.

15:54.512 --> 15:56.480
- Yeah, but that's what you
do when you're getting jumped,

15:56.514 --> 15:57.915
you focus on one.
- What?

15:58.015 --> 15:59.283
- And the next time he came
around,

15:59.383 --> 16:00.718
the other one wasn't there.

16:04.322 --> 16:05.890
- Jeremy, but we have to do
something.

16:05.990 --> 16:09.393
I feel strongly about this.

16:09.493 --> 16:10.661
- Okay, alright. Alright.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.497
We'll just talk to him
and see what he says.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.399
- Yeah.

16:15.499 --> 16:16.901
- But you know what?

16:17.001 --> 16:19.236
We probably just jumping to
conclusions, like I said, man.

16:19.337 --> 16:20.638
- Don't start with me.

16:20.738 --> 16:22.306
- No, look--
- You always--

16:22.440 --> 16:24.809
I don't jump to conclusions,
Jeremy. There you go.

16:24.909 --> 16:26.110
- Baby. Baby.
- What?

16:26.210 --> 16:29.347
- We're not experts.
- I'm--I'm a mama.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.649
Jeremy, I don't have to be
no expert. I don't need that.

16:31.749 --> 16:33.117
I know what I saw.

16:33.217 --> 16:35.553
I saw sadness
in that boy's face today,

16:35.653 --> 16:36.921
and I can't stand by,

16:37.021 --> 16:38.689
we can't stand by--
- Okay. Alright. Alright, baby.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.258
- Don't okay me, Jeremy!
- Look, look, alright.

16:40.358 --> 16:43.461
We'll talk to him.
- I'm serious, baby.

16:45.896 --> 16:47.798
- Okay, well, the dishes
are done.

16:47.898 --> 16:49.767
- Yeah, can I watch TV?

16:49.867 --> 16:53.170
- Did you finish your homework?
- Yeah.

16:53.271 --> 16:54.805
I just gotta--
- No, that means no.

16:54.905 --> 16:56.240
You didn't finish your homework.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.743
Finish your homework, and then
you can watch for one hour.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.511
- One hour?
- One hour!

17:00.611 --> 17:01.946
- One hour?
- JEREMY: One hour!

17:02.046 --> 17:03.614
- Who watches TV for one hour?

17:03.714 --> 17:05.149
- BOTH: You.

17:05.249 --> 17:06.918
- Prisoners have more freedom.

17:07.018 --> 17:08.886
- I don't think they do.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.924
Little buddy. Kick rocks.
- Wow.

17:13.024 --> 17:15.326
- In front of company? Okay.
Alright.

17:15.493 --> 17:16.560
- Mm-hmm.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.496

thanks for coming to dinner.

17:18.529 --> 17:21.432
Bye.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.904
- Bye. Uh, you're still standing
here.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.340
- Oh, bye.
- Hey, okay, we were gonna talk.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.576

I'm--I'm so tired.

17:32.677 --> 17:36.314

- Yeah, I'm just, uh--

buddy?

17:51.295 --> 17:53.531

17:53.631 --> 17:56.133
tonight.
- Yeah. Yeah, I was.

17:56.233 --> 18:00.037
- Why were you so hungry?
- Well, you know, I was--

18:00.137 --> 18:01.172
I was working today,

18:01.272 --> 18:04.208
and I didn't get to eat.
- Okay.

18:04.308 --> 18:05.977

18:10.181 --> 18:13.851
Um, thank you so much
