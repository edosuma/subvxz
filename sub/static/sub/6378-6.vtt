WEBVTT

00:27.486 --> 00:30.023
Oh, that's it, baby.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.733
Yeah.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.568
"Baby"?

00:35.285 --> 00:37.697
I'm over a thousand years old.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.074
Are you not having a good time?

00:40.999 --> 00:44.617
Well, there's just not much thrill left
in feeding on the willing.

00:45.254 --> 00:48.667
Then should I try
pretending not to want it?

00:48.840 --> 00:53.675
Only if you're very, very good at it.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.131
Stop. Get off me.

01:01.019 --> 01:07.140
You sick bloodsucking bastard.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.945
Off you go.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.495
Tell your manager you were magnificent.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.616
l'll back up your story if he calls.

01:31.341 --> 01:35.175
l was beginning to think you weren't
going to accept my invitation, Lorena.

01:35.971 --> 01:40.965
For a vampire, you're a terrible liar.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.614
Tell them to go away.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.748
It could be anyone.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.424
-Who's there?
-lsabel, from the summit.

03:41.805 --> 03:45.844
-And who is this?
-His name is Hugo.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.632
He is mine.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.897
I could see how worried you were
about Sookie infiltrating the Fellowship.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.732
I thought Hugo could help.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.897
And why would you wanna help us?

04:02.075 --> 04:05.488
Because Godric is my sheriff, not yours.

04:05.662 --> 04:10.201
It would be criminal of me to let you take
such a risk without my at least offering.

04:10.375 --> 04:14.288
-And why would you wanna help us?
-Well, I would do anything for Isabel.

04:14.629 --> 04:20.124
Forever, and not just my forever,
your forever, and forever and forever.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.418
It's true, he would.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.006
He loves her.

04:24.181 --> 04:28.140
-You, he loves you very much.
-And | him.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.513
Consider my offer.
If nothing else, with Hugo there...

04:33.690 --> 04:36.022
...Sookie will be less likely
to arouse suspicion.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.310
People of the church,
they have a way of not trusting a woman...

04:39.488 --> 04:41.024
...when she's absent a man.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.278
Bill, l have to say...

04:42.449 --> 04:45.361
...as a woman who's been absent a man
most of her life...

04:45.535 --> 04:47.366
...that could not be more true.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.703
I considered booking you
in the room adjoining theirs...

04:53.877 --> 04:57.461
...but I thought that might be
a bit over the top.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.872
Why am I here, Mr. Northman?

05:00.342 --> 05:02.048
We want the same thing, you and l.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.297
Okay, Bill has something I want...

05:08.475 --> 05:10.386
...and he's in the way.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.723
-His human?
-No, she's something more than human.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.013
What is she?

05:17.108 --> 05:19.315
That I do not know.

05:19.486 --> 05:24.230
But whatever she is, he loves her.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.989
What makes you think I want him back?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.902
That I'd even take him?

05:34.084 --> 05:37.576
Because you didn't come all this way
just to see me.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.876
I haven't seen Bill Compton
in over 70 years.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.917
Surely you can't think l have
any pull over him whatsoever.

05:45.095 --> 05:48.462
I haven't seen my maker
for much longer than that...

05:48.640 --> 05:51.382
...and yet I am still loyal to him.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.102
Fiercely loyal.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.227
Shame I didn't turn you.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.936
Then again...

06:01.570 --> 06:03.606
...you're not really my type.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.364
Enjoying the entertainment?

06:53.538 --> 06:55.620
Oh, yes. Very much.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.497
Yes, he's wonderful. Just wonderful.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.171
He is quite wonderful.

07:06.593 --> 07:10.586
I love your necklace. lt's extraordinary.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.598
Oh, thank you. I love it too.
It was a gift from Sidney.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.884
Yeah, it cost me a pretty penny...

07:17.062 --> 07:19.678
...but got me out of
a whopper of a fight, huh?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.517
Right, doll?

07:22.525 --> 07:26.985
Hey, where'd you say you two
were all from again? Was it Miss...?

07:27.155 --> 07:32.445
Olivier. Faviana Olivier.
And we are from Europe. France.

07:32.619 --> 07:36.032
I'm hoping to hop over the pond
sometime soon, take this one with me.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.575
I've always wanted to see Europe.

07:38.750 --> 07:43.289
You would like it.
And it would certainly like you.

07:45.340 --> 07:49.504
You seem European already.

07:50.553 --> 07:55.047
Most Americans these days
are so puritanical.

07:56.893 --> 07:57.973
Fuck prohibition.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.429
-Sidney.
-Yes.

07:59.604 --> 08:04.724
-He's so crass.
-But he's right. Fuck prohibition.

08:14.285 --> 08:18.995
If you'd like,
after your other guests leave...

08:19.165 --> 08:22.282
...Guillaume and I could stay
and we could all...

08:22.460 --> 08:26.578
...fuck prohibition somewhat further.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.338
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.348
-Wonderful.
-This gentleman is wonderful.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.104
Smashing.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.514
lam Guillaume.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.077
Hey.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.659
What happened here?

09:45.043 --> 09:48.035
Oh, baby, if you don't wanna tell me....

09:48.546 --> 09:50.286
It's all right.

09:50.673 --> 09:55.542
It's just when I take my clothes off,
it's all anybody ever sees.

09:56.387 --> 10:00.676
The answer is |--
I don't know what happened.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.093
-You mean you don't remember?
-Oh, I remember.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.682
Heck, I'll never forget it.

10:06.856 --> 10:11.771
| just never got a look at who
or what it was that jumped me.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.274
Jesus. Where were you?

10:15.448 --> 10:18.485
In the woods, running.

10:18.660 --> 10:23.575
And then whatever it was, it was on me.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.863
lt slashed me.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.245
And then I was sick, real sick, for weeks.

10:28.419 --> 10:32.662
Doctors couldn't figure out what it was.

10:33.258 --> 10:38.423
They told me l was lucky to be alive,
and I should count my blessings.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.472
And I still do, every single day of my life.

10:43.518 --> 10:49.309
You are the most amazing person...

10:49.482 --> 10:50.892
...l've ever met.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.852
You're just saying that because
I'm the first honest sex you've ever had.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.237
No, that's not true.

11:00.743 --> 11:04.452
Have you told anybody else
what you are?

11:06.166 --> 11:09.078
Yeah. My--

11:09.252 --> 11:12.585
My friend Sookie. She knows.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.957
And have you slept with her?

11:18.094 --> 11:19.595
No.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.754
Well, I rest my case.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.850
Seriously though, Sam,
you shouldn't be ashamed of what you are.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.765
I'm not ashamed.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.685
-| just don't go around advertising it.
-Well, neither do |.

11:36.863 --> 11:40.151
But the people that I know,
the people that I love...

11:40.325 --> 11:42.281
...I don't keep it a secret from them.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.078
How come you do?

11:48.458 --> 11:51.325
I guess it's because
it's dangerous out there.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.373
It's like, why take the risk?

11:56.966 --> 12:00.629
Because not taking a risk is riskier.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.636
That's just wordplay.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.138
No. No, it's not.

12:10.063 --> 12:14.602
The way I look at it, if you're gonna take the
danger out of getting to know someone...

12:14.776 --> 12:16.812
...might as well
not bother with them at all.

12:17.570 --> 12:21.154
You've gotta share this life with people.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.404
It's what we were put on
this big old round ball to do.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.949
And people, they need to know you.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.082
You're just too damn special
for them not to.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.334
Where the fuck did you come from?

12:51.437 --> 12:54.850
I'm looking for a pump
for an A.O. Smith water heater.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.266
-Can you hold on?
-Yeah, I'll hold.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.479
Shit.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.270
Want me to take a look
and you can hold the line?

13:02.448 --> 13:06.487
That was some spiteful shit, what you said.
I got this, okay? I'm the man of the house.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.323
-No offense, Karl.
-None taken.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.034
How's your coffee?

13:13.084 --> 13:16.451
Colder than that ridiculous excuse
for a shower.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.039
I don't know what to tell you.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.126
| wish I had a fancier crib
for you to squat in, but I don't.

13:22.635 --> 13:27.720
Tara, you may not know this about me,
but without a hot shower in the morning...

13:27.890 --> 13:30.222
...l have no tolerance for sarcasm.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.054
-Sorry.
-You still there?

13:32.228 --> 13:33.468
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.886
-Yeah, we got one.
-You do?

13:35.064 --> 13:38.227
-Yep.
-Great. We'll be there as soon as we can.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.642
Hardware shop in Ferriday's
got the part we need.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.562
Ferriday is over two hours away.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.355
It's an old water heater, Maryann.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.865
I called everyone I could
within a 150-mile radius.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.903
This guy's the only one
who's got a pump that'll fit it.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.241
So do you want somebody
to go get it or not?

13:55.918 --> 13:57.909
Drive like the wind.

13:58.921 --> 14:02.129
-Maybe Eggs ought to come--
-I want him working on the water heater...

14:02.300 --> 14:06.669
...in case he can jury-rig something
so I can take some semblance of a shower.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.508
Maryann, lthink
you're overestimating your plumber.

14:10.183 --> 14:14.552
Besides, if I have to drive a car and look at
a map at the same time, I'll crash your Jag.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.344
I know I Will.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.522
You can go. Go, go, go.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.277
Cool.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.949
Where you been, Stackhouse?
We're 10 minutes late.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.240
Didn't they say
what they wanted to see us for?

14:37.418 --> 14:41.127
All they said was to grab you and
get our butts down to the sanctuary lawn.

14:41.297 --> 14:45.006
-Why, you think it's something bad?
-It can't be good.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.592
Good morning.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.595
-Think you can handle it?
-Yeah.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.431
-Oh, yeah.
-|t's just a--

14:57.605 --> 14:59.937
Well, it's a platform
with a cross on top of it.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.316
-Seems pretty straightfon/vard.
-Good. Good, good.

15:03.861 --> 15:07.649
Look, I'm sorry, but the rest of the group,
they're back at camp training, right?

15:07.824 --> 15:09.485
Shouldn't we be with them?

15:11.327 --> 15:13.818
I mean, we ain't being punished
for something, are we?

15:14.247 --> 15:18.991
Jason Stackhouse, of all the things.
Now, what would we be punishing you for?

15:23.506 --> 15:25.792
Nothing. Nothing at all.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.923
Well, then how about you stop sulking...

15:28.094 --> 15:31.086
...and try to be a little thankful
for the job you've been given?

15:34.684 --> 15:35.924
Oh, my golly.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.935
You know,
I didn't even think of the parallels.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.690
-Should we tell them?
-I don't think that's such a good idea.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.522
Honey, they're the best of the best.
They deserve to know.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.357
Now, can you boys keep a secret?

15:48.614 --> 15:50.821
-I hope so.
-|'|| take it to the grave.

15:50.992 --> 15:55.281
This platform we're having you build,
it's for a ceremony.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.663
Have either of you ever heard
the expression "meet the sun"?

16:00.042 --> 16:01.703
You for real?

16:01.878 --> 16:04.915
-Steve--
-Sarah, I'm talking.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.005
Luke, you wanna do the honors?

16:10.136 --> 16:14.300
Well, if it's what I read about, meeting
the sun's when you take a vampire...

16:14.474 --> 16:16.681
...and chain him to the cross
just before dawn.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.718
When the sun comes up, the congregation
gets to watch from the bleachers...

16:20.897 --> 16:24.355
...as a vampire ignites,
sent to his fiery grave once and for all.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.731
-Jesus Christ.
-Well, yes, him, but the sun too.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.068
Get to work, boys.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.572
-You should probably wear this.
-Oh, Hugo.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.704
Yes. Yes, a thousand times, yes.

16:39.874 --> 16:43.537
And also, just so that they believe
that we're a couple about to get married...

16:43.711 --> 16:46.578
...it'd probably be best if you let me
do most of the talking.

16:46.756 --> 16:50.089
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll just shut up and look pretty.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.584
-That's not what I meant.
-Yes, it was.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.128
It's okay.
It'll be easier to listen in on others...

16:55.306 --> 16:58.093
...if I don't have to worry
about carrying on a conversation.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.883
Good, good.
But if they do ask you any questions...

17:01.062 --> 17:04.395
...are you sure you're gonna be able
to say the things about vampires...

17:04.565 --> 17:06.647
-...that they're gonna wanna hear?
-Hugo...

17:06.817 --> 17:09.399
...l don'tjust hear the things
that hateful people say.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.435
I hear the things that are so hateful...

17:11.614 --> 17:14.572
...that hateful people
don't even wanna say them out loud.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.902
Don't you worry about me.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.784
I've got plenty of material to work with.
I'll be fine.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.445
Good.

17:20.790 --> 17:24.783
It's funny, I don't even know you really,
but you're the only other person...

17:24.961 --> 17:26.792
...l've ever met who's dated a vampire--

17:26.963 --> 17:28.499
What do you wanna know?

17:30.091 --> 17:31.126
Everything.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.634
Like do you and Isabel ever fight?

17:35.805 --> 17:36.965
Oh, we fight like crazy.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.260
But I've been with women
I didn't fight with before.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.301
With every one of them,
the only reason that we never fought...

17:43.479 --> 17:46.186
...was because
I didn't care enough to bother.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.315
Oh, Hugo, that is messed up.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.567
Maybe. But it's also true.

17:52.738 --> 17:58.199
It's funny, but whenever Bill and me fight,
even as I'm screaming and I'm so mad...

17:58.369 --> 18:02.988
...I don't think I'm ever gonna stop,
somehow, in the middle of all that...

18:03.165 --> 18:05.872
...I know we're both fighting
for our relationship.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.624
For each other.

18:07.795 --> 18:11.162
-We're fighting to stay together.
-Do you--?

18:12.091 --> 18:15.003
-Never mind.
-What?

18:15.970 --> 18:19.838
Lately, the thing Isabel and I
have been fighting about the most...

18:20.224 --> 18:23.432
...is whenever I bring up the subject
of her turning me...

18:23.603 --> 18:25.844
...she just shuts down.
She won't even discuss it.

18:26.606 --> 18:31.100
Is that a thing that people actually do?
Because it never even occurred to me.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.189
How could it not?
I mean, right now it's all well and good...

18:34.363 --> 18:36.854
...but in 50 years,
when they're still what they are...

18:37.033 --> 18:38.944
...but we're in our 703 and 80s...

18:39.118 --> 18:41.825
...and we're hunched over and frail
and using walkers?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.820
Come on. How could they still love us?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.078
We should go.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.917
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have told you that. I--

18:57.094 --> 19:02.214
It's okay, Hugo, really.
Besides, now if I die today, who cares?

19:02.391 --> 19:06.384
I'll never have to feel old
and unloved and unwanted.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.262
Right.

19:14.737 --> 19:21.734
"Bitches, don't you know that sarcasm
and cold water do not mix?"

19:24.372 --> 19:25.987
Oh, shit.

19:26.165 --> 19:30.033
All right, so the next thing you wanna do
is hop on the 165 South.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.578
Excellent.
You're a hell of a navigator, you know?

19:47.937 --> 19:49.268
Eggs?

19:49.438 --> 19:52.601
Okay, there's gonna be a diner
that's built out of an old red barn...

19:52.775 --> 19:54.515
...coming up around the bend.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.231
-You been here before?
-No, never.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.653
-Now, why the fuck did I know that?
-All right, you're freaking me out.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.614
-You better not be fucking with me.
-No, no. Turn right here.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.904
-Eggs, tell me what's going on.
-I don't know.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.573
-Please, just turn right here. Come on.
-Shit.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.761
Eggs.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.659
Where you going, Eggs?

20:54.503 --> 20:57.415
You still up for doing something
after work tonight?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.455
Yeah. Sure.

20:59.633 --> 21:05.594
Good, because ljust got off the phone,
and I've got a surprise lined up for you.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.549
I don't like surprises, Arlene.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.183
Well, that's too bad...

21:11.353 --> 21:17.019
...because I just happen to be
an extremely mysterious woman.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.772
Can I get y'all anything else?

21:21.947 --> 21:24.279
How about that iced tea
I ordered five minutes ago?

21:24.450 --> 21:27.237
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.
I'll be right back with that.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.743
And some Worcestershire.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.698
-Any chance I'll get it?
-Zero.

21:33.876 --> 21:37.243
-She's about the worst I've ever seen.
-Well, maybe it's for the best.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.003
Seems like lately
if you're too good a waitress...

21:40.174 --> 21:42.256
...someone's gonna come along
and kill you.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.542
You are so bad, Maxine.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.722
Hey there, Sam. Lafayette here?

21:49.892 --> 21:51.723
In the kitchen.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.389
I've been noticing some strange things
about you lately.

21:59.193 --> 22:00.399
Like?

22:00.569 --> 22:03.356
Like the fact that you just up and vanish
for over two weeks.

22:03.531 --> 22:07.649
Like the fact that now that you are back,
you seem to have lost some of your pizzazz.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.830
-My pizzazz?
-That's right.

22:13.290 --> 22:17.533
Now, in case you didn't hear, Lafayette,
a woman's dead.

22:17.711 --> 22:21.249
A woman thatjust so happened to have
ripped off your cousin and your auntie.

22:21.882 --> 22:25.716
So for the record,
where were you all that time?

22:27.263 --> 22:28.924
I was on a cruise.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.683
A cruise, huh? What kind of cruise?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.091
A gay one.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.469
Why don't you tell me
what you're accusing me of?

22:36.647 --> 22:38.433
You weren't on any damn gay cruise.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.688
Because if you were, you would have
come back with more pizzazz, not less.

22:43.320 --> 22:47.108
So how about you and I go down
to the station and I lock you up?

22:47.283 --> 22:50.867
Leave you in a cell to rot
until you confess.

22:51.245 --> 22:52.951
Or you can just tell me now.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.118
Because I already know
what you were doing.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.830
You were hiding out. Lying in wait.

23:00.004 --> 23:03.212
You killed that woman
and cut her heart out.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.630
Now, tell me I'm not right.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.964
-Leave him alone, 002.
-Terry, you need to shut up.

23:10.139 --> 23:14.098
And you need to get up.
Think I will take you down to the station.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.680
I said get the fuck up.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.679
What the hell, Andy?
Back when we were kids...

23:19.857 --> 23:23.520
...and we used to play Cops and Robbers
in Me-maw and Pa-po's backyard...

23:23.694 --> 23:26.811
...you always used to make your arrests
with dignity.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.738
This ain't the kind of cop
you set out to be.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.652
And by the way, everybody knows
that you ain't even a cop anymore.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.159
Get the hell out of here.

23:38.584 --> 23:42.042
-But he's a suspect.
-No, he ain't.

23:42.504 --> 23:45.917
And even if he was,
does he look like he's about to run to you?

23:49.470 --> 23:51.461
All right, you're right.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.431
I'm sorry, Mr. Reynolds.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.515
Okay.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.734
Okay, buddy.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.487
Come here. Come here.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.403
Yeah, come here.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.531
Close your eyes.

24:21.085 --> 24:24.623
Close them. Close them.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.870
That's good.

24:28.550 --> 24:32.543
Now, I want you to imagine...

24:32.721 --> 24:35.633
...a golden glowing ball...

24:36.225 --> 24:40.343
...radiating warmth and safety.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.392
That's good.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.367
-Activation required.
-Hoyt.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.904
-You remember Bonita Lou Morris.
-Nice to see you again, Miss Morris.

25:00.582 --> 25:01.833
I paid that bill last week.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.868
I wanna know why my phone
is telling me "activation required."

25:05.045 --> 25:07.081
Because I canceled it.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.171
Goddang it, Mama.

25:09.925 --> 25:13.509
Now Jessica's probably gonna think
I'm one of those guys that never text back.

25:13.679 --> 25:17.137
Good. Girls who call boys
at all hours of the night like that...

25:17.307 --> 25:19.923
...are only looking for one thing: money.

25:20.102 --> 25:23.060
-We don't have any money.
-That's not true.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.936
We're very comfortable.

25:26.108 --> 25:29.396
I told you I would let you date
a girl like that over my dead body...

25:29.570 --> 25:30.605
...and I meant it.

25:30.779 --> 25:34.363
-This is only the first step.
-Oh, yeah?

25:35.576 --> 25:38.943
Reactivate it
or the next step's gonna be all mine.

25:41.123 --> 25:45.537
And one last thing about my girlfriend
that I think both of y'all need to know.

25:45.711 --> 25:49.954
The reason that Jessica calls me
all late like she does...

25:52.051 --> 25:53.712
...is that she's a vampire.

26:11.278 --> 26:14.770
-I can't work.
-And why is that?

26:14.948 --> 26:17.860
Every time I look at that pool table,
I keep seeing you on it...

26:18.035 --> 26:20.151
...and then I can't think
about anything else.

26:20.329 --> 26:23.992
-What do you say we get out of here?
-And go where?

26:24.166 --> 26:29.081
Well, we'll sneak out the back and shift,
and run and play.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.506
Do it out under the sun.

26:32.091 --> 26:36.209
I would love to, but ifl left work right now,
my boss would kill me.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.379
Don't slap me with a harassment suit
for telling you this...

26:39.556 --> 26:45.347
...but if you don't go out back right now
and take off all your clothes, I will fire you.

26:45.521 --> 26:49.480
-Well, we wouldn't want that.
-No, we wouldn't.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.692
-|'|| meet you out back in two.
-Make it one.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.125
Help me out, Stackhouse.
What should go there?

27:11.547 --> 27:13.583
-God! Son of a--
-You all right?

27:13.757 --> 27:17.215
Yeah, I'm fine, just-- Stupid.

27:17.386 --> 27:20.378
No, you're just preoccupied.
So come on now, out with it.

27:20.556 --> 27:23.969
And I hope I don't have to remind you
you're wearing your ring of honesty.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.725
Yeah, I don't know, man. ljust....

27:29.231 --> 27:34.646
Remember what you said the other day
about me only being sent up on--?

27:34.820 --> 27:38.153
On account of Sarah wanting my--?
My johnson?

27:38.323 --> 27:40.575
Man, that's just me being jealous.

27:40.742 --> 27:44.030
Even as it was coming out of my mouth,
I knew God was frowning on me.

27:44.204 --> 27:47.742
Because not only do you deserve
everything coming your way, but Sarah...

27:47.916 --> 27:51.534
...if she ain't the holiest person I know,
then I don't know who is.

27:53.297 --> 27:56.460
Luke, the day that we met, you said--

27:56.633 --> 27:59.750
You said that you'd been abstinent
for the last three years.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.008
That's right.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.046
How come?

28:04.224 --> 28:06.886
Because sex outside of marriage is a sin.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.597
-Now, you really believe that?
-It ain't what I believe.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.477
It's what God believes.

28:12.858 --> 28:15.440
But some sins are bigger than others.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.021
Like what?

28:17.196 --> 28:22.441
Let's say you're gonna do it out of wedlock,
gotta make sure the girl ain't married either.

28:22.826 --> 28:26.444
-Right, because adultery's bad.
-One of the worst.

28:26.622 --> 28:29.455
Right up there with incest and bestiality.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.289
What the fu--?

28:31.460 --> 28:35.624
But all of them put together ain't half
as bad as if you do it to a vampire.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.251
Or to a dude.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.967
Or a vampire dude,
that's like creme de la creme of sins.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.593
Ain't no repentance for that.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.129
Straight to hell, baby.

28:46.308 --> 28:48.765
But everything else you can repent from.

28:49.811 --> 28:53.975
Sure. God's a--
He's an open-minded guy.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.309
To a point.

28:57.361 --> 29:00.478
Jason Stackhouse, abstinent.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.820
Sounds good, don't it?

29:04.159 --> 29:05.774
Not really.

29:09.498 --> 29:11.284
Went to the sun to fry.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.619
What?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.341
That is awesome, Stackhouse.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.507
Be here all day.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.509
-Why do I recognize her?
-Because she's on TV all the time.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.596
That's Sarah Newlin.
She's the reverend's wife.

29:32.104 --> 29:36.848
Oh, right. You know, in person,
she looks like vanilla pudding.

29:42.948 --> 29:46.816
Hi there. I just happened to be looking
out the window as you were driving up.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.201
I thought I'd come on out
and greet you myself.

29:49.371 --> 29:52.863
-I'm Sarah Newlin. And you all are?
-Hi, Holly Simpson.

29:53.041 --> 29:56.499
I cannot believe I'm actually meeting you.
You are cute as a button.

29:56.670 --> 29:57.785
Well, thank you, Holly.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.204
And you're like a cool breeze
on a hot summer day.

30:00.382 --> 30:01.667
-Quit.
-And you are?

30:01.842 --> 30:05.084
_|'m__
-Silly me. This is Rufus Dobson, my fiancé.

30:05.262 --> 30:08.720
I love saying that word.
In fact, sometimes I love it so much...

30:08.890 --> 30:12.178
...I don't even wanna get married
just so I can keep on calling him it.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.560
But we're going to. Get married, that is.

30:16.064 --> 30:19.147
-Which is why we're looking for a church.
-Well, excellent.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.900
-And I'm pleased to meet you too, Rufus.
-|t's an honor.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.401
The honor's mine.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.905
Now, how about you all follow me in
and we'll see if Steve is available.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.909
-I'm sure he'd just love to meet you both.
-For real? Reverend Newlin himself?

30:31.079 --> 30:34.742
-Oh, that would be just super.
-Well, come on.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.241
You were gonna let me do the talking.

30:38.420 --> 30:41.708
When I get nervous,
sometimes I talk too much.

30:42.299 --> 30:46.508
Well, the funny thing is,
Rufus and I actually met in church...

30:46.678 --> 30:49.670
...but we both left, like, a month later...

30:49.848 --> 30:54.091
...when we realized that our pastor
was a little iffy.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.884
He was a homosexual.

30:56.063 --> 31:00.648
We don't know that. He might have been,
but what became all too clear was that...

31:01.860 --> 31:05.398
...he was a sympathizer.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.028
See, that really ticks me off.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.690
I mean, how can you claim
to be a God-loving person...

31:09.868 --> 31:11.699
...and love something that God detests?

31:11.870 --> 31:14.953
-|t's upsetting.
-It is. It is upsetting...

31:15.123 --> 31:17.956
...but that's why
my fiancee and I are here.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.082
We wanna make this our new home.

31:20.337 --> 31:23.955
We are thrilled that you've chosen us.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.088
Wonder how that platform '3 coming.

31:29.096 --> 31:33.681
...and watch the sun do him the justice
that 2000 years of living couldn ’t.
...I can't help but feel that we're all
gonna make each other's worlds richer.

31:33.683 --> 31:34.012
...I can't help but feel that we're all
gonna make each other's worlds richer.

31:34.184 --> 31:37.301
It'll be amazing to finally
be amongst like-minded people.

31:38.105 --> 31:42.439
I don't care what anyone says about
vampires being able to control themselves.

31:42.609 --> 31:45.442
I know better.
I know that every single one of them...

31:45.612 --> 31:48.399
...is a vicious, bloodthirsty killer.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.867
You have a lovely home.

32:03.046 --> 32:06.209
-Th-- Th-- Thank you.
-You're weI-- WeI-- Welcome.

32:06.383 --> 32:09.170
-We'll enjoy living in it.
-Put him in the armchair.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.965
Face it toward the bed so he can watch.

32:14.558 --> 32:15.638
What? Watch what?

32:31.783 --> 32:33.398
Say "au revoir. "

32:33.577 --> 32:34.657
Say it.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.865
Why are you doing this?

32:38.290 --> 32:39.530
Well, because we can.

33:14.451 --> 33:17.284
-Wait.
-What is it?

33:28.965 --> 33:30.580
I want you to have this.

33:35.597 --> 33:38.589
You are so thoughtful and generous.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.843
I love you, William Compton.

34:18.640 --> 34:22.508
We've been walking for over 45 minutes.
You still haven't told me where we're going.

34:22.686 --> 34:25.348
-I said I don't know.
-"I don't know" ain't a place, E993-

34:25.522 --> 34:28.764
It's a state of mind.
A state of mind I don't like being in.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.810
What the fuck?

34:37.826 --> 34:39.657
Eggs?

34:44.165 --> 34:46.201
-|'ve been here before.
-I thought you said--

34:46.376 --> 34:49.584
I know what I said, and--
So I guess I haven't, but I have.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.665
I don't....

34:55.760 --> 35:00.254
Oh, Tara. Now, something happened here.
Something horrible happened.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.923
-That's pretty obvious.
-You think this is funny?

35:03.101 --> 35:05.808
No, but it don't make sense.
When shit don't make sense...

35:05.979 --> 35:10.143
...it means there's a logical explanation,
you just haven't thought of it yet.

35:10.317 --> 35:13.855
Maybe it's from when you were a little kid.
Maybe somebody brought you here.

35:14.029 --> 35:18.363
Tara, I grew up in foster homes in Memphis,
and when you grow up like that...

35:18.533 --> 35:21.320
...people ain't trying to take you
on fucking vacations.

35:21.494 --> 35:25.407
Now, I know one thing.
I've been here before. ljust don't even--

35:39.012 --> 35:40.343
Shit.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.133
Is that blood?

35:43.975 --> 35:46.591
We must have walked a mile and a half,
maybe two miles...

35:46.770 --> 35:50.354
...and I had no idea
where we were going.

35:53.443 --> 35:56.981
But then we end up right here
looking at this?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.731
Tara, this ain't no fucking coincidence.

36:10.752 --> 36:14.370
Come on, let's get you home.
Take it slow.

36:17.467 --> 36:20.755
Yep. See you soon.

36:23.098 --> 36:26.556
-Careful now.
-Careful? About what?

36:26.726 --> 36:29.433
Sometimes when we open these doors...

36:29.604 --> 36:32.596
...so much love comes flowing out
that it'll knock you down...

36:32.774 --> 36:34.139
...if you're not ready for it.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.853
We'll be sure to brace ourselves.

36:44.160 --> 36:48.449
-Oh, my gosh.
-I know. ljust love it in here.

36:48.623 --> 36:52.957
The way it glows like it does.
Particularly in the late afternoon.

36:53.128 --> 36:56.416
-Oh, it's inspiring, isn't it?
-It really is.

36:56.589 --> 36:59.126
Yes, sirree.
This is where we're getting married.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.586
I can't wait to see you
walk down this aisle.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.217
-Me either.
-Hey.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.505
-Have either of you ever been to a lock-in?
-A lock-in?

37:06.683 --> 37:08.423
Of course she hasn 't.
She's no Christian.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.809
Oh, yeah, it's loads of fun.
Everybody brings their sleeping bags...

37:17.569 --> 37:18.979
We all spend the night on cots,
Sarah and myself included.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.143
They say she can hear me.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.607
I wonder if that fang-loving freakazoid
can hear me right now.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.443
She sure don 't look normal.

37:24.617 --> 37:27.404
That lock-in does sound like fun.

37:27.579 --> 37:31.163
-Rufus, we gotta go get our sleeping bags.
-But the tour's not even over yet.

37:31.332 --> 37:35.075
I know, but I think we really ought to go
so we can come back for the Iockdown.

37:35.587 --> 37:40.547
There'll be plenty of time to get ready.
The lock-in is not until tomorrow night.

37:40.717 --> 37:43.003
-You wanted to see me?
-Oh, good. Holly, Rufus...

37:43.178 --> 37:45.760
...l'd like you to meet an aide of mine.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.425
-This is Gabe.
-Pleased to meet you.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.095
Hi.

37:52.353 --> 37:55.561
Nice. Very nice. She's got just
the perfect amount of titties showing.

37:55.732 --> 37:58.644
Gabe here is gonna be joining us
for the rest of the tour.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.659
I know that pig.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.129
Pig!

38:26.137 --> 38:27.673
Hey, pig!

38:29.599 --> 38:31.430
Wait up, pig!

38:37.232 --> 38:39.314
Stupid fucking pig.

38:41.778 --> 38:46.522
-How amazingly exhilarating was that?
-My heart's still pounding.

38:46.699 --> 38:49.827
I know. Mine too.

38:50.453 --> 38:53.991
Hey, why'd you become a pig?

38:54.499 --> 38:56.581
I was expecting to see you
become a doe again.

38:56.751 --> 39:00.369
Yeah, pig is my go-to shift.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.246
It almost seemed like
Andy recognized you.

39:03.424 --> 39:09.795
You know? The way he was
yelling after you, like, "Pig! Pig!"

39:09.973 --> 39:12.180
Isn't "pig" exactly
what you would call a pig...

39:12.350 --> 39:14.136
...that you didn't know?

39:16.437 --> 39:20.180
Yeah, but still, it's-- It's weird.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.147
Hush.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.954
-Remember me?
-Oh, shit.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.126
You do. How's life?

39:46.175 --> 39:48.302
Not so good.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.293
ls you real?

39:50.471 --> 39:54.464
This is nice.
I could sleep here in a pinch.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.429
What are you doing here?
I ain't said nothing to nobody.

39:57.604 --> 39:58.719
And I knew you wouldn't.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.934
Why didn't the fuck
y'all just glamour me, huh?

40:02.108 --> 40:03.814
Poor thing. We would have...

40:03.985 --> 40:06.317
...but then you wouldn't remember
that you owed us.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.315
Owe you?

40:08.656 --> 40:10.942
Eric sent me with a request.

40:11.117 --> 40:14.029
-You're back in business.
-Oh, no, I ain't.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.659
I'm out of that shit.

40:15.997 --> 40:20.457
So sorry, but you're very much
back in this shit.

40:20.627 --> 40:25.667
You locked me up and tortured me
for damn-near three motherfucking weeks...

40:25.840 --> 40:27.831
...because you caught me selling V.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.169
And now....

40:29.761 --> 40:30.921
Now what?

40:32.680 --> 40:36.298
What the fuck is vampires doing
selling V anyway?

40:36.476 --> 40:39.263
We're not. You are.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.052
Get to work.

40:47.612 --> 40:50.775
Now I'd like to take y'all to see
a very special part of the church.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.940
-There's more?
-Yes, my father's tomb.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.529
-|t's on the lower level.
-Honey, are you sure?

40:55.703 --> 40:56.738
Absolutely, darling.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.700
Steve, I just don't see why we need
to take them down there.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.115
You can literally feel
the presence of his spirit.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.785
-|t's okay. We don't need to see it.
-|t's the rock our church was built on.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.080
Like St. Peter's tomb
in the Catholic Church...

41:08.257 --> 41:10.088
...only without being polluted by evil.

41:10.259 --> 41:12.545
Did you know there was actually
a vampire pope...

41:12.720 --> 41:14.551
...back in the Middle Ages?

41:18.059 --> 41:19.390
Rufus.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.639
-What's the matter?
-|t's no big deal.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.305
She just has a tiny little case
of claustrophobia.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.348
We both do, actually.

41:27.527 --> 41:31.645
At least take a quick little look. That way,
you can say you saw the whole church.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.155
-You'll be making an informed decision.
-Steve.

41:34.325 --> 41:37.067
It's all right, Sarah.
This is something they need to see.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.072
But we've already decided
that we're getting married here.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.333
So how about we go back
to our apartment, look at a calendar...

41:45.503 --> 41:47.243
...and call you to set the date.

41:47.422 --> 41:49.413
-No. Gabe.
-Get off me!

41:49.590 --> 41:52.457
-Hey. What are you doing? Let me go.
-Oh, no! Let go of me!

41:53.928 --> 41:55.919
Is something happening to your human?

41:56.097 --> 41:57.337
Lorena.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.427
-Let go of me!
-Come on.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.342
Hey, a little help here, Gabe?

42:02.520 --> 42:05.057
Pretty sure the banger's on V,
the fucking cunt.

42:05.231 --> 42:06.596
-Steve.
-Help!

42:07.650 --> 42:10.437
I made you. Your blood knows mine.

42:10.611 --> 42:13.023
You will never physically overpower me.

42:20.455 --> 42:22.446
-I got her.
-I'm sorry.

42:22.623 --> 42:25.751
-Stop fighting me, goddamn it.
-Let me go!

42:30.882 --> 42:32.622
What the hell?

42:32.800 --> 42:36.668
Just when I thought today
couldn't get any fucking freakier.

42:40.308 --> 42:43.641
-People are pigs.
-You got that right.

42:48.483 --> 42:50.519
Here. Take this joint.

43:11.881 --> 43:15.499
Shouldn't have smoked that joint,
because this is really freaking my shit out.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.212
I feel like that kid in E. T.

43:17.386 --> 43:20.378
Except instead of following Reese's Pieces,
we following clothes.

43:20.556 --> 43:24.344
I ain't never seen E. T., but Reese's Pieces
sound real good right now.

43:24.519 --> 43:26.305
Don't they though?

45:15.296 --> 45:18.288
-Who is it?
-It's-- It's Hoyt.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.256
Hoyt?

45:21.427 --> 45:25.136
Come on, open up.
I know you must be mad at me.

45:25.306 --> 45:28.013
I'm so sorry.
My mama canceled my cell service...

45:28.184 --> 45:30.391
...and I had no way
to get in touch with you.

45:30.561 --> 45:33.143
I got here as fast as I could.

45:36.776 --> 45:38.767
I'm so sorry, Jessica.

45:39.195 --> 45:42.483
I can't believe it.
You came all this way?

45:43.658 --> 45:45.239
You're not mad at me?

45:46.369 --> 45:48.906
No. I'm so happy I could cry...

45:49.080 --> 45:51.822
...but I don't want to,
because it's really gross when I do.

45:54.001 --> 45:57.334
I'm sorry about the flowers too.
I got them in Bon Temps before I left.

45:57.505 --> 46:00.247
-It was just really hot in my car.
-No, they're beautiful.

46:17.525 --> 46:19.015
Hello.

46:20.695 --> 46:23.778
Steve? Sarah?

46:25.366 --> 46:26.947
Anyone?

46:27.868 --> 46:31.452
I'm up here. Up here on the balcony.

46:33.249 --> 46:36.787
Hey. I just wanted to tell you
that Luke and me...

46:36.961 --> 46:39.873
...we're done with the platform.

46:40.047 --> 46:41.378
Great.

46:42.383 --> 46:44.089
Thank you.

46:46.345 --> 46:48.381
Hey, are you crying?

46:49.307 --> 46:50.888
No.

46:58.232 --> 47:00.848
I'm sorry.
You're not supposed to see me like this.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.184
No, it's okay. Really.

47:04.989 --> 47:08.607
-What's the matter?
-|t's Steve.

47:09.952 --> 47:12.068
He's not the man I thought he was.

47:13.539 --> 47:16.747
Sarah, your husband is a great man.

47:17.918 --> 47:21.752
And I feel bad
about what we did last night too.

47:22.423 --> 47:25.256
But we can't try to make it
easier on ourselves by--

47:25.426 --> 47:26.757
By blaming the victim.

47:27.636 --> 47:29.251
Jason”.

47:29.889 --> 47:32.596
...you and Luke and all the others...

47:33.351 --> 47:35.387
...you're not being trained to defend us.

47:37.438 --> 47:41.397
He wants to use you to start a war.

47:41.650 --> 47:44.266
Does that sound like a great man to you?

47:45.988 --> 47:48.775
-What?
-Well, he's not one.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.282
And I thought he was...

47:53.496 --> 47:56.909
...but lately I've been seeing
a side of him I never did before.

47:58.292 --> 48:02.501
He's vicious and he's cruel,
and he uses the C-word.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.925
And he lies to me, Jason.

48:07.093 --> 48:11.427
Our marriage has always been a partnership,
but now he's shutting me out.

48:13.182 --> 48:15.639
Come on, now. Here.

48:16.102 --> 48:17.888
Don't cry.

48:20.606 --> 48:22.892
There. All gone.

48:31.700 --> 48:35.318
-I should go.
-When I was a little girl...

48:36.288 --> 48:39.121
...I realized that I had a calling.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.164
That I was put here on this earth to be
that great woman behind her great man.

48:44.839 --> 48:48.627
And when Steve came into my life,
I thought he was that man.

48:50.511 --> 48:52.672
But now I see it...

48:53.222 --> 48:55.213
...clear as day.

48:56.559 --> 48:58.766
I'm supposed to be with you.

49:00.312 --> 49:01.973
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:03.816 --> 49:05.932
We can't. It's wrong.

49:08.362 --> 49:10.523
-You're married.
-Not in my heart.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.530
Not anymore.

49:14.452 --> 49:20.618
And how can this be wrong
if it's what God's commanding me to do?

49:23.919 --> 49:27.787
Think God really wants this?

49:29.049 --> 49:30.710
Yes.

49:34.847 --> 49:40.058
-You talk to him?
-Every single day of my life.

49:41.729 --> 49:44.141
And he wants this, Jason.

49:44.315 --> 49:48.308
Oh, God, I promise.

49:57.161 --> 49:58.742
Okay.

50:19.892 --> 50:22.725
-Where are you taking me?
-Don't be such a nervous nelly.

50:22.895 --> 50:24.931
It's a surprise.

50:33.447 --> 50:36.029
What? You don't like drums?

50:36.200 --> 50:41.115
No. It'sjust that in my experience,
no good can come from drum music.

50:41.914 --> 50:44.656
Follow it and all it ever leads you to
is hippies and cults.

50:45.292 --> 50:46.372
Not this time.

50:50.130 --> 50:51.791
Hey!

50:51.966 --> 50:54.582
-Daphne?
-Sorry, Sam.

50:55.636 --> 50:56.967
What the hell's going on?

51:20.786 --> 51:22.401
What the fuck is this?

51:23.080 --> 51:24.661
It's the end of the road.

51:59.992 --> 52:04.235
No! No!
