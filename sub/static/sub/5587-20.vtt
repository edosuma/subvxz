07:52.573 --> 07:54.639
Lanky Hank,
and the foreign-exchange kid

07:54.641 --> 07:55.707
who knows nothing
of our customs.

07:55.709 --> 07:59.511
No! This is the only time
you'll ever be captain.

07:59.513 --> 08:00.812
You can't pick the wienies.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.882
You got to pick the winners,
earn their respect.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.518
This is a defining moment
for you, bro.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.086
<i> Barry made</i>
<i> a convincing argument,</i>

08:08.088 --> 08:10.455
<i> but there was no way</i>
<i> I'd pick the athletes</i>

08:10.457 --> 08:11.289
<i> over my best friends...</i>

08:11.291 --> 08:14.726
I'll take Corbett,
Big Luke Schmidt, Spink,
and Taz money.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.528
<i> ...But I found a way.</i>

08:16.530 --> 08:19.130
Dude, what the hell
did you just do to us?

08:19.132 --> 08:20.031
Don't worry.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.667
Good news is,
I'm climbing the social ladder

08:22.669 --> 08:23.335
by stepping on you guys.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.303
It'll take a while,
and I'll have to be

08:25.305 --> 08:27.839
mean to you at first...
Super-mean...

08:27.841 --> 08:29.574
But one day,
we'll all be cool.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.743
Me first, though.
I don't like
your plan at all.

08:31.745 --> 08:35.814
Oh, please, Dave Kim,
you'd do the
exact same thing.

08:35.816 --> 08:36.281
No way.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.883
My allegiance would
always be to my friends

08:37.885 --> 08:39.684
and Sergei
the exchange student.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.720
<i> Ja!</i>
This betrayal will not stand.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.921
Much like
<i> Revenge of the nerds,,</i>

08:42.923 --> 08:47.125
We will dig deep and use
our brains to defeat you
once and for all.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.460
ALL: Yeah!
Yeah!

08:48.462 --> 08:50.095
<i> But there would be no revenge.</i>

08:50.097 --> 08:51.329
<i> ¶ Basketball</i>

08:51.331 --> 08:53.498

<i> I like the give-and-go ¶</i>

09:05.312 --> 09:06.912
(CHUCKLES)
Nice assist, Goldie.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.114
All you, Taz money.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.483
Yes. Well done,
Adam the betrayer.

09:11.485 --> 09:13.652
Come on, Dave Kim.
I'll make it up to you.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.320
Switch teams.
That's a no.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.788
<i> After picking</i>
<i> the best players,</i>

09:16.790 --> 09:18.623
<i> I was finally crushing</i>
<i> at gym class.</i>

09:18.625 --> 09:20.125
<i> Also crushed</i>
<i> my friends' spirits.</i>

09:20.127 --> 09:23.595
Enough! This game
has made a mockery
of physical education.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.665
Now, I'm not gonna
name names, but there's
a young man in here

09:26.667 --> 09:30.135
with big ideas
and small conviction.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.636
Adam. Is Adam.

09:31.638 --> 09:32.537
That's right, foreign kid.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.940
Coach was sold a bill
of goods on how
to make this class fair,

09:34.942 --> 09:37.075
and he will deliver
on that promise.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.712
So, next class, we'll have
the same teams,

09:40.714 --> 09:42.881
but, Dave Kim,
you pick the game.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.082
It can be anything you want.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.719
Chess, word puzzles,
something with a calculator.

09:47.721 --> 09:51.890
All right, then.
I choose dungeons & dragons.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.392

get free pizza and

ADULT ADAM: <i> After deciding</i>
<i> Carnegie Mellon was</i>
<i> too far for Erica,</i>

10:14.881 --> 10:18.249
<i> my dad had an idea for</i>
<i> a different college choice...</i>

10:18.251 --> 10:19.818
<i> One a lot closer to home.</i>

10:19.820 --> 10:20.518
What the hell, Murray?

10:20.520 --> 10:23.755
I know you're exploring your
many options for next year,

10:23.757 --> 10:27.025
but the way I see it,
there's just one.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.126
Yeah, CMU.

10:28.128 --> 10:28.860
Goldberg U.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.529
Why go to college
hundreds of miles away

10:31.531 --> 10:34.733
when you can enjoy
the comforts of campus life

10:34.735 --> 10:35.333
right here at home?

10:35.335 --> 10:39.137

The school cafeteria.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.507
<i> It did not start out strong...</i>

10:42.509 --> 10:45.577
Shrimp parm
three times a week.

10:45.579 --> 10:46.277
<i> And then it got worse...</i>

10:46.279 --> 10:49.014
Our state-of-the-art
dorm room.

10:49.016 --> 10:49.614

Here's our student lounge.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.122
Oh, look!

10:57.124 --> 11:00.825
One of our esteemed
faculty has stopped by.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.860
I can't get over it.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.895
He throws a party
in his dorm room

11:03.897 --> 11:07.332

being told not to.

But the point is,
you are going to Goldberg U.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.938
Wait, so you spent
your whole life

11:13.940 --> 11:15.807
saying you wanted
your kids out of the house,

11:15.809 --> 11:18.443
and now you want me
to stay forever?

11:18.445 --> 11:18.977
Yes.

11:18.979 --> 11:22.480
Well, I didn't apply,
and also, this
isn't a school.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.015
Murray, I'm usually
the irrational one

11:24.017 --> 11:27.352
who keeps our children from
enjoying their lives, not you.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.988
All right,
look at this movie.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.056
That's what college is.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.892
Do you want Erica

some of the tickle
out of the movie for me.

11:38.865 --> 11:42.567
Our daughter deserves
a first-class education.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.002
She needs to
experience life.

11:44.004 --> 11:47.305
She can experience it here

to go back to school

can't really do that.

a lot of wrestling
and confusion on
why D&D is a thing,

so let's just continue.

12:18.872 --> 12:19.971
Zinethar the priest,
your move.

My move is,
I change my name
to Dick Biggens.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.313
You can't change your name.

12:28.315 --> 12:28.880
Yeah!

12:28.882 --> 12:32.217
I meant you're facing
a deadly, gelatinous cube.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.017
How do you evade it?

12:33.019 --> 12:35.386
Evade it? Let's kick
that Jell-O's ass.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.387
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.055
It's a gelatinous cube.

12:37.057 --> 12:40.458
If you attack it,
it'll slurp you up
and digest you alive.

That's not a chick.

Can my guy
make out with her?

12:48.201 --> 12:49.134
I want to make out
with her, too.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.669
What do I got to roll?
Fine.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.037
A dryad suddenly appears.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.140
If you roll a 20,
you can kiss her.

Oh!
Oh!

13:00.380 --> 13:01.479
Yeah! Yeah!

13:01.481 --> 13:04.149
I take her back
to my apartment,
and we do stuff.

13:04.151 --> 13:04.983
BOYS: Ooh.

13:04.985 --> 13:05.817
There's no apartment.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.952
If you won't let me get busy
with the tree lady,

13:07.954 --> 13:09.821
then I stab the Jell-O man
in his face.

13:09.823 --> 13:13.291
And you're paralyzed
and slowly eaten alive.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.627
End of game.
I've heard enough.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.462
Time for Barry to fix this.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.863
Where did he come from?

13:18.865 --> 13:19.497
He does that.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.833
Just go away.
This is hopeless.

13:21.835 --> 13:22.600
That's where you're wrong.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.970
The only problem is,
you guys don't speak
the same language.

13:25.972 --> 13:26.971
You speak lazy-eyed nerd,

13:26.973 --> 13:31.209
and, like me, you speak
awesome, all-star athlete.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.777
Score.
Yeah, man.

13:32.779 --> 13:33.845
I like this, bro.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.079
Of course you do.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.614

I'm ripped like you,

13:36.616 --> 13:38.683
my body has also
been infected

13:38.685 --> 13:40.418
by my brother's
crippling geekery.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.954
I tried to fight it,
but it's too powerful.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.556
And it's led to this.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.430
I wanted one ready
in case you asked me to play,

13:52.432 --> 13:54.899
but... You never did.

13:54.901 --> 13:57.101
I just assumed
you didn't care.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.871
Point is, if this
crazy-jacked bro

13:59.873 --> 14:01.372
can learn how to play D&D,

14:01.374 --> 14:03.608
other super-shredded
bros can, too.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.845
I mean, sure, we're shredded,
but we suck at this game.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.214
Adam keeps yelling at us
and hurting our feelings.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.683
That's 'cause you used
a lightning-bolt spell

14:11.685 --> 14:14.853
in an underwater melee
like a bunch of scrubs.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.855
We're just not good
at it like you.

14:16.857 --> 14:20.191
Do you have any idea how
it feels to... to suck so bad?

14:20.193 --> 14:24.796
Actually, I do...
When I play basketball.

14:24.798 --> 14:26.598
I, I didn't know that.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.433
Yeah, man. Sorry.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.603
All right. Lord Big of Tasty,
teach us how to win.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.738
I shall.
But first...

14:33.740 --> 14:36.374
Coming off the top rope!

14:38.245 --> 14:39.844
ALL: Oh!

14:40.614 --> 14:42.247
Hey, boopie.

14:42.249 --> 14:42.847
Go away.

14:42.849 --> 14:46.050
Look, I wanted to apologize
for your dad.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.986
Some people
just don't understand

14:47.988 --> 14:50.054
the boundary between
parent and child.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.190
Are you high
on nail polish?

14:52.192 --> 14:53.791
I never went to college.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.493
This whole thing
has made me realize

14:55.495 --> 14:59.497
everything I missed out on,
and at the end of the day,

14:59.499 --> 15:03.301
I couldn't bear it
if you missed out
on those things, too.

15:03.303 --> 15:03.902
Really?

15:03.904 --> 15:06.738
Trust me,
college is gonna be amazing.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.407
We are gonna have
so much fun.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.910
Oh, my God.
Thank you s...

15:11.912 --> 15:12.944
Wait. "We"?

15:12.946 --> 15:13.745
Yes. Crazy story.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.647
I was watching this movie
with Pops, and...

15:15.649 --> 15:16.881
Please don't say
<i> Back to School.</i>

15:16.883 --> 15:21.786
It was <i> Back to School,</i>
and I realized that
could be us.

15:21.788 --> 15:22.787
Hmm?

15:22.789 --> 15:23.187
No! Dad!

15:23.189 --> 15:25.189
Wherever you are sitting
or eating in this house,

15:25.191 --> 15:26.824
come to my room
immediately.

15:26.826 --> 15:27.458
It's an emergency.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.595
I was both sitting and eating,
so this better be worth it.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.797
I'm going to
Carnegie Mellon with Erica.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.165
No.
We're gonna be roommates.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.233
No!
We're gonna sneak in

15:35.235 --> 15:37.168
a hot plate
to cook ramen soup.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.703
Never!
And then we're gonna

15:38.705 --> 15:39.671
rush the same sorority.

15:39.673 --> 15:40.471
This is a nightmare.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.940
And I'll be her mother
and her sister.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.042
Kill me.
She's right, Beverly.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.076
You're acting nuts.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.210
Yes. Thank you.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.112
'Cause she's obviously
not going away at all.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.415
Erica's staying here
and being my little peanut.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.650
What is wrong
with you people?

15:52.652 --> 15:55.353
Seriously,
I get no respect!

15:55.355 --> 15:55.887
No respect.

15:55.889 --> 15:58.890
That's exactly what
Rodney Dangerzone says.

15:58.892 --> 16:01.592
See?
We are on the same team.

16:01.594 --> 16:02.593
No, we're not.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.429
If either of you
were on my team,

16:04.431 --> 16:06.164
you would actually hear
my hopes and dreams

16:06.166 --> 16:09.467
and not try to take them away
or make them about you.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.135
So just forget
all of it.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.339
I won't go to college
at all.

16:15.508 --> 16:15.974
Wow.

16:15.976 --> 16:19.811
I guess we both
really blew it here, huh?

16:19.813 --> 16:20.345
Mostly you.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.347
ADULT ADAM: <i> As my parents</i>
<i> were facing off against Erica,</i>

16:25.051 --> 16:26.150
<i> the face-off of a lifetime.</i>

16:26.152 --> 16:28.619
Looks like Goldberg
and his merry band
of meatheads

16:28.621 --> 16:29.787
are a no show.

16:29.789 --> 16:30.388
Congrats, boys.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.856
You just earned yourself
a cheese pizza.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.901
Whatever.
By the end of this game,

16:43.903 --> 16:45.403
you guys aren't
gonna know what end

16:45.405 --> 16:47.038
of the Staff of the Magi
you're holding.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.506
Well, if you're
casting confusion,

16:48.508 --> 16:50.742
the Staff of the Magi
gives the user a plus-two

16:50.744 --> 16:54.412
on saves versus magic,
so, uh, good luck with that.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.814
(GASPS)
They've learned our ways.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.316

<i> It was the greatest game</i>

17:44.097 --> 17:45.263
<i> Except for Coach Mellor,</i>

17:45.265 --> 17:47.298
<i> who didn't realize</i>

<i> and with one last move,</i>

<i> I would become</i>
<i> a gym-class hero.</i>

18:00.580 --> 18:03.247
All right, Goldfarb,
as you reach the soul gem,

18:03.249 --> 18:08.920
you find a gelatinous cube
slowly oozing towards you.

18:08.922 --> 18:09.954
Take the gem.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.956
Finish it up, Goldberg.
Easy lay-up.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.492
Go ahead, betrayer. End it.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.593
Don't act like that.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.262
Me and my boys
won this fair and square.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.764
It's not about
winning, man.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.767
D&D was the one thing
we were good at,

18:22.769 --> 18:24.836
and now...

18:24.838 --> 18:26.571
You took that away, too.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.315
Take the gem
and win the game already.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.883
Please.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.086
I raise my sword...

18:43.756 --> 18:44.622
and toss it aside

18:44.624 --> 18:47.592
and swan-dive directly into
the gelatinous cube.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.893
(GASPING)
Adam, no!

18:48.895 --> 18:50.261
What? Are you crazy?
No, no.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.362
Everybody, shut up.

18:51.364 --> 18:55.733
You do realize you'll die
if you touch the Jell-O thing.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.505
I touch the Jell-O.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.672
No!
Stop!

19:01.674 --> 19:03.474
I touch the Jell-O!

19:03.476 --> 19:06.244
I touch the Jell-O!

19:06.246 --> 19:10.348
And you're dead.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.019
Good game.

19:15.021 --> 19:15.753
I don't get it.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.989
You finally had their respect.
Why give it up?

19:17.991 --> 19:22.326
<i> (TENDERNESS</i> PLAYS)
I guess it's not
their respect I want.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.730
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And so, that day,</i>
<i> I fell on my sword</i>

19:25.732 --> 19:28.833
<i> to save something</i>
<i> much more important,</i>

19:28.835 --> 19:32.770
<i> and my parents realized</i>
<i> letting go was more important</i>

19:32.772 --> 19:33.738
<i> than holding on.</i>

19:33.740 --> 19:36.374
Hey, squishy.
Can we talk?

19:36.609 --> 19:39.310
Oh, God, I'm gonna cry.
Murray, you talk.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.878
(SIGHS) Rough start.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.114
Look, you know how
I sometimes say to you kids

19:43.116 --> 19:44.982
that I want you
out of the house?

19:44.984 --> 19:46.217
Only three to five
times a day.

19:46.219 --> 19:49.987
Yeah, well, the reason is
it always seemed so far away.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.256
Then I blinked
and here we are,

19:52.258 --> 19:56.060
And... I guess
I just wasn't ready for it.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.429
<i> ¶ But I was scared to go</i>
<i> much further with it</i>

19:58.431 --> 19:59.363

19:59.365 --> 20:00.965
I won't go
to college with you.

20:00.967 --> 20:01.933
Unless you want me to.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.034
Never.
You'll sleep on it.

Lord Big of Tasty,
in the clearing,

21:01.194 --> 21:03.327
you encounter a she-wolf.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.028
Fight or flee?

21:04.030 --> 21:06.764
I do a few push-ups to get
pumped up, and I ask her out.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.266
For sure.
Yeah, boy.

21:08.268 --> 21:08.766
Boom! (LAUGHS)

21:08.768 --> 21:10.534
But then, suddenly,
her smokin' hot twin sister's

21:10.536 --> 21:13.638
also there, and she's like,
"Hey, why don't we all party?"

21:13.640 --> 21:17.174
And then we hop into the wolf
hot tub that's also there.
