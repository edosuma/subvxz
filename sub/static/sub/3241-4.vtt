WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.507
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.586 --> 00:05.965
<i>We were in Scotland
on our second honeymoon.</i>

00:07.508 --> 00:10.387
<i>I wanted it to be a dream,
but I knew it wasn't.</i>

00:10.469 --> 00:12.471
<i>I'd seemed to have
fallen through time.</i>

00:12.554 --> 00:14.477
<i>Seems that the feral cat
we picked up on the road</i>

00:14.556 --> 00:15.728
is trying to pull in her claws.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.525
<i>Colum is taking credit
for bringing you on as healer</i>

00:17.601 --> 00:18.602
<i>to the MacKenzies.</i>

00:18.685 --> 00:20.483
<i>I doubt he'll want to
see you leave anytime soon.</i>

00:20.562 --> 00:23.190
<i>I sent Jamie to the stables
to help Old Alec with the horses.</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:25.321
<i>Best place for him
under the circumstances.</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:26.572
Dinna want him inside the walls.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.370
<i>Jamie needs a woman, not a Jessie.</i>

00:28.445 --> 00:30.994
And Laoghaire
will be a lassie until she's 50.

00:31.073 --> 00:34.373
Mistress Beauchamp was just about to
tell me of her unusual upbringing.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.703
I'm sure it's a good story.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.504
<i>She came back through the stones?</i>

00:37.579 --> 00:39.377
Aye, she did. They always do.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.925
<i>I must escape Castle Leech on my own</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:44.970
<i>and get back to the stones
as soon as possible</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:46.672
<i>or die trying.</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

03:00.889 --> 03:03.187
- Tonight we feast!
- And eat like kings!

03:03.266 --> 03:04.939
You won't make a meal of me yet!

03:05.018 --> 03:06.565
The beast is getting away!

03:14.945 --> 03:16.743
Something catch your eye there,
lassie?

03:16.822 --> 03:19.621
Yes, something
I'm not likely to forget in a hurry.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.624
Mistress Claire.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.005
You've lost your fichu.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.961
And you lost your hair ribbon
yesterday.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.546
So I have.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.883
I was so concentrated on
escaping you, I didn't even notice.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.218
Are you done with your game, lass?

03:39.428 --> 03:40.554
Soon.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.186
The MacKenzie dinna say you could
waste the whole day out here.

03:45.642 --> 03:49.317
Well' who says we're done yet?
There's still lots more to explore.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.023
You were right, Mistress.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.200
This pan of the woods is
much better than the courtyard

03:53.275 --> 03:54.902
or the other side of the castle.

03:54.985 --> 03:58.034
- Can I be the boar this time?
- I don't see why not.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.330
All right. To the hunt!

04:00.490 --> 04:01.537
Mistress Beauchamp!

04:03.994 --> 04:06.588
We're missing the festivities.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.462
It's nae since I was a bairn
we've had a gathering at Leoch.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.253
All right.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.713
Shall we let these men
get to their festivities?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.012
Come on.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.341
- We can play again tomorrow.
- Of course.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.055
All right. Shall we?

04:31.480 --> 04:33.983
<i>The hunting game was
more than a pleasant diversion.</i>

04:34.065 --> 04:36.534
<i>It allowed me to reconnoiter
the terrain around the castle</i>

04:36.610 --> 04:38.078
<i>without suspicion.</i>

04:38.153 --> 04:41.373
<i>So far I had found at least
two possible escape routes,</i>

04:41.448 --> 04:44.327
<i>and left breadcrumbs
to mark my way to freedom.</i>

05:16.191 --> 05:19.240
Doubt ye've ever seen anything
as braw as this where yer from, eh?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.571
No.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.167
<i>The victory day celebrations
in London and Paris</i>

05:26.243 --> 05:28.371
<i>far exceeded the gathering
of the MacKenzie clan</i>

05:28.453 --> 05:30.455
<i>in terms of sheer size,</i>

05:30.539 --> 05:32.792
<i>but this was something different.</i>

05:32.874 --> 05:34.501
<i>Simple joy,</i>

05:34.584 --> 05:38.464
<i>unencumbered by the trauma of war
or the exhaustion of its end.</i>

05:38.588 --> 05:41.592
<i>The MacKenzies were simply
glad to see one another.</i>

05:43.260 --> 05:45.262
<i>Despite my eagerness to leave,</i>

05:45.345 --> 05:48.315
<i>my heart lifted whenever
I walked through the encampment</i>

05:48.390 --> 05:51.109
<i>and a small part of me
regretted my imminent escape.</i>

05:53.353 --> 05:56.072
<i>I had the entire route
mapped out in my head.</i>

05:56.147 --> 05:58.741
<i>At night, both windows
would be lighted by torch,</i>

05:58.817 --> 06:01.570
<i>beacons to guide me
to the breaches in the sentry posts.</i>

06:01.653 --> 06:03.701
<i>But I still needed
to find distractions</i>

06:03.780 --> 06:05.908
<i>for my ever-present shadows.</i>

06:14.958 --> 06:17.632
Gentlemen, please do not look,

06:17.711 --> 06:21.136
but that woman stirring the bowl
over there seems to fancy one of you.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.471
I said don't look.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.554
Aye.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.643
She's a pie-eater, that one.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.060
Well, I'll just be settling my cock
to roost in that tonight.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.736
Not so fast.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.030
We said everra man for himself
during the gathering.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.606
Aye, we did.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.658
But ye ken how much
I fancy a hen with a bit of meat.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.735
Who doesn't?

06:41.818 --> 06:44.287
I may be of some assistance.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.410
I realize
I'm a captive audience of sorts.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.787
But I'd rather not be subjected
to another one of your inane debates.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.711
So if you please, pull sticks?

06:53.997 --> 06:56.375
- Either one?
- Aye.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.300
Right. Choose.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.684
'Tis all yer wanking
gives ye that much speed of hand.

07:12.015 --> 07:15.019
I'll save some pie for ye?

07:15.101 --> 07:18.150
<i>I now needed to tend to
the other elements of my plan.</i>

07:18.229 --> 07:20.573
I'll need to pick a horse
for the hunt tomorrow.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.902
The lad wants a healer
to go along just in case.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.533
Come along.

07:39.542 --> 07:43.763
<i>Uncle Lamb had taught me to ride
during the years we lived in Ireland.</i>

07:43.838 --> 07:45.465
<i>But that was a long time ago,</i>

07:45.548 --> 07:47.846
<i>and I needed to pick
a gentle, easy horse.</i>

07:49.052 --> 07:50.349
Mistress.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.810
There's no one
in need of healing here.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.938
I was told I would be needed
for the hunt tomorrow.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.860
She'll be wanting a horse, then.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.984
I suppose, yes, if I mean to keep up.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.861
Most of the horses
have been spoken for.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.995
I don't want to be of any trouble.
Perhaps Mr. MacTavish can help me.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.242
Lad's no here.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.409
Best to leave Jamie
to his own thoughts today, lass.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.995
I didn't know I was a bother to him.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.876
I dinna ken if yer a bother or no.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.336
That's for the lad to judge.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.214
I'm just saying it's best
for all concerned

08:21.292 --> 08:23.420
if young Jamie is left to himself
while the gatherings on.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.302
'Tis Brimstone.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.013
I'm sure she'll be
all right for yer needs.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.347
Brimstone.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.274
- Sounds ominous.
- Nah.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.851
'Tis like calling a tall man "wee."

08:38.559 --> 08:41.484
She's no fast, but she's sweet
and can go for days.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.986
Only thing is if yer not
minding her every moment,

08:44.065 --> 08:45.988
she'll turn for home
first chance she gets.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.112
I'll leave you two to get acquainted.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.085
<i>There would be no turning for home,</i>

08:55.160 --> 08:57.254
<i>not if I had
anything to say about it.</i>

09:13.762 --> 09:16.106
- Brought the port ye asked for.
- Christ, Geillis.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.354
Mrs. Fitz told me
I might find you down here.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.236
Hope I'm not disturbing ye.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.906
No, of course not.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.733
I was elsewhere.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.786
Thank you.
I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.363
No trouble.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.073
We have plenty collecting dust.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.002
Something in port
makes my husband fan like an ox.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.167
Claire.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.125
Are you with bairn, then?

09:44.250 --> 09:45.251
Pardon me?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.429
Ye've quite a stock of food here.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.840
Are ye eating for two?

09:50.924 --> 09:52.926
Do you think that's simply
because I have a store here

09:53.009 --> 09:56.183
rather than trudging
back and forth to the kitchen?

09:57.639 --> 10:00.438
Perhaps that's why
you're desperate to get to France?

10:01.851 --> 10:03.694
An illegitimate pregnancy?

10:05.105 --> 10:08.826
I can assure you I've never
been unfaithful to my husband.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.902
It's not unfaithful if he's dead.

10:15.657 --> 10:16.658
Is he?

10:24.165 --> 10:25.382
He's not alive.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.216
So he's...

10:30.672 --> 10:31.969
...dead, then.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.400
He's dead.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.482
And the two of you never conceived?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.985
No. We never had children.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.162
We tried.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.248
Maybe you're barren.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.586
Well, it doesn't matter now.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.124
See ye have trouble sleeping as well.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.381
Valerian root.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.005
I have trouble sleeping, too.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.136
But I don't
mash my valerian like that.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.893
I boil it whole first.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.146
I was wondering
about the proper dosage.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.393
How much do you take?

11:21.764 --> 11:23.812
It's not for me.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.485
Put it in Arthur's evening tea.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.613
Then I sleep like a newborn.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.698
Careful, though.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.027
Ye have enough there to put a whole
army to sleep till the next moon.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.037
Thank you.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.455
I'll boil it in the future.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.039
When I first came to Cranesmuir,

11:43.119 --> 11:45.292
all I had was my wits, ye ken?

11:46.789 --> 11:50.293
I had a fairish knowledge
of the plants and their good uses.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.884
I found a man
with a respectable position.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.225
Decent house. Some money put away.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.554
I know he's not much to look at,
as ye well ken.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.648
But that doesn't trouble me much.

12:04.641 --> 12:07.611
I'm free. Can do whatever I please.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.696
You seem to have built quite
the comfortable life for yourself.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.448
Sometimes ye find yerself
on a path you never expected.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.709
Doesn't mean it can't
lead you to a bonny place.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.583
I'd love to stay and chat, Geillis,

12:29.666 --> 12:31.839
but I still have so much to do
and prepare for the hunt.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.465
The hunt.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.678
That must be what yer preparing for.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.098
Of course.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.610
The highlands are no place
for a woman to be alone.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.188
You'd do well to remember that.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.529
See you later at the oath-taking?

12:57.485 --> 12:58.702
Are ye sure?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.365
Promise.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.659
Careful.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.623
Promise is a serious thing
in this country.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.632
Mine, too.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.315
<i>Later tonight,</i>

13:31.394 --> 13:34.398
<i>all the fighting men of the MacKenzie
clan would gather in the hall</i>

13:34.480 --> 13:36.778
<i>and make their oaths of allegiance
to Colum.</i>

13:36.858 --> 13:39.236
<i>No one would be watching the stables.</i>

13:47.368 --> 13:49.086
<i>I was almost ready.</i>

14:06.429 --> 14:08.352
<i>Tonight would be
my one and only chance</i>

14:08.431 --> 14:11.310
<i>to escape Leoch
and return to Craigh na Dun.</i>

14:36.751 --> 14:39.129
<i>I knew how I might dodge my shadows.</i>

14:39.212 --> 14:41.510
<i>I had my mount and my provisions.</i>

14:42.548 --> 14:45.392
<i>Now all I lacked was a weapon,
should I need it.</i>

14:48.388 --> 14:49.560
Claire.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.564
Yer no wearing that
to the ceremony, are ye, lass?

14:53.643 --> 14:54.644
The ceremony?

14:56.145 --> 14:58.398
I assumed a Sassenach
wouldn't be welcome

14:58.481 --> 14:59.778
at such an important event.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.279
Don't be silly.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.657
Yer Colum's personal guest.
Ye must attend.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.789
I'm not dressed for the occasion.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.958
We'll see to that straightaway.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.754
I'd hate to put you out.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.477
We'd better hurry now.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.564
The beginning of the oath-taking
is the best part.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.944
- How do I look?
- Lovely.

15:41.023 --> 15:45.028
<i>At first, I thought Mrs. Fitz's
intervention would disrupt my plans,</i>

15:45.111 --> 15:48.490
<i>but then I realized that with her
at my side as a proper escort,</i>

15:48.573 --> 15:51.702
<i>my shadows would be less vigilant
as I moved through the castle.</i>

15:51.784 --> 15:53.457
<i>I needed them to relax,</i>

15:53.536 --> 15:55.709
<i>to let down their guard
and enjoy the festivities</i>

15:55.788 --> 15:57.711
<i>if I was to distract them later.</i>

15:57.790 --> 15:59.212
- Glenna.
- Iona.

16:00.251 --> 16:03.596
I see you have the place
looking bright as a new pin.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.015
That lovely dress again.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.933
Ye wore it so well
to the last gathering.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.352
Murtagh.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.654
The MacKenzie's
welcoming the men to Leoch.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.409
He hopes they had easy journeys.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.212
Also hopes that never a day will come

17:59.287 --> 18:01.415
when the clan's fighting men
will have to draw iron,

18:02.164 --> 18:03.165
but if they do...

18:06.711 --> 18:08.008
Aye!

18:08.671 --> 18:11.720
He couldn't hope for a better lot
than stands before him today

18:11.799 --> 18:13.142
to defend the clan's honor.

18:21.892 --> 18:25.271
It is a right daft soul
that would challenge the MacKenzies,

18:25.354 --> 18:26.606
weapons or no.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.204
And he's proud
to be called their laird.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.445
I swear

19:13.527 --> 19:16.246
by the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

19:16.322 --> 19:18.074
and by the holy iron that I hold,

19:18.866 --> 19:20.243
to give ye my fealty

19:21.202 --> 19:24.957
and to pledge ye my loyalty
to the name of clan MacKenzie.

19:25.039 --> 19:28.919
And if ever I shall raise my hand
against ye in rebellion,

19:29.001 --> 19:32.972
I ask that this holy iron
shall pierce my heart.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.918
I swear

20:52.001 --> 20:54.470
by the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

20:54.545 --> 20:57.139
and by the holy iron that I hold,

20:57.214 --> 20:59.967
to give ye my fealty
and pledge ye my loyalty.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.178
Are they all the same, the oaths?

21:02.845 --> 21:03.937
Aye.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.481
Oh, well.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.776
If you've seen one, then.

21:08.851 --> 21:11.821
I ask that this holy iron
shall pierce my heart.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.127
Congratulations.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.171
Interesting ceremony.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.749
But I've seen enough. Shall we go?

21:31.832 --> 21:34.005
No. Where are we going?

21:34.877 --> 21:36.174
Back to the surgery.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.802
I have to prepare the supplies
for the hunt tomorrow.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.679
Dedicated, are ye, now?

21:40.758 --> 21:43.807
Well' I dinna ken
how ye celebrate in Oxfordshire,

21:43.886 --> 21:46.639
or wherever it is ye cry home,

21:46.722 --> 21:48.816
but I'm not missing the gathering,

21:48.891 --> 21:50.893
biding with you down in yer hole.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.603
Suit yourself, but I'm going.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.814
Well, Dougal's standing orders
are to stay with ye.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.194
Mistress.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.027
Can ye see fit to stay?

22:00.110 --> 22:03.865
At least until
I bag a lass for the evening?

22:06.659 --> 22:07.706
Fine.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.002
If I must.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.330
May as well join in.

22:13.123 --> 22:16.252
Now, that's more in the spirit.

22:35.938 --> 22:36.939
That's not rhenish.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.774
It's port.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.280
Very expensive.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.204
Port.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.326
'Tis very strong.

22:48.409 --> 22:49.661
Tis.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.711
I canna seem to keep my legs.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.384
It's a sedative.

22:58.294 --> 22:59.637
Is that Spanish?

23:00.671 --> 23:04.767
Go. Don't let me keep you.
Some lucky lady awaits.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.934
Take the wine.
Share it with all your friends.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.191
<i>The more unconscious
clansmen tonight,</i>

23:21.150 --> 23:22.322
<i>the better.</i>

23:22.401 --> 23:24.244
Ye rascals!

23:24.320 --> 23:25.947
I'll have yer hand!

23:52.598 --> 23:54.942
Laoghaire, you startled me.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.485
I'm sorry, Mistress Beauchamp.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.812
It's Claire.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.320
Aye.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.445
Is there something
I can do to help you?

24:02.524 --> 24:03.946
Aye.

24:04.026 --> 24:06.120
If I can trouble ye for a wee favor?

24:06.195 --> 24:09.324
- You're not injured, are you?
- No, no, I'm Draw.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.377
Well, I was wondering if

24:15.537 --> 24:20.794
you had a potion that might
open a lad's heart to a lassie.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.679
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

24:24.171 --> 24:28.051
Ye ken, a potion,
or maybe a brew of some kind

24:29.051 --> 24:30.052
that would help a lad...

24:30.594 --> 24:31.891
A love potion?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.939
No, I dinna mean to offend ye,
Mistress.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.982
I just had it in mind that...

24:36.058 --> 24:38.607
Well, ye aid so many
with your healing

24:38.686 --> 24:41.030
that maybe ye have something
in yer keen knowledge

24:41.105 --> 24:44.109
that could help a lass
hold a lads attention.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.990
Mr. MacTavish?

24:49.238 --> 24:50.990
Well, you didn't appear
to need much assistance

24:51.073 --> 24:52.791
the last time I saw you two together.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.584
Well, not for that.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.462
It's for moving his heart forward.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.593
Wait there.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.687
<i>Dried horse dung.</i>

25:17.766 --> 25:19.313
<i>Harmless if a bit pungent.</i>

25:20.477 --> 25:22.320
<i>Jamie would never know
the difference.</i>

25:22.396 --> 25:23.613
<i>Perfect.</i>

25:39.913 --> 25:41.005
Here.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.300
Sprinkle the contents of this
at his threshold.

25:43.876 --> 25:47.346
Stand outside the door,
tap your heels together three times,

25:47.421 --> 25:49.094
and recite,

25:49.173 --> 25:51.596
"There's no place like love,
there's no place like love."

25:52.718 --> 25:54.311
Thanks to ye.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.603
Claire.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.185
Good luck.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.448
<i>Past the storeroom on the right.</i>

26:10.527 --> 26:11.870
<i>Avoid the kitchen.</i>

26:11.945 --> 26:13.117
<i>Through the east wing,</i>

26:13.781 --> 26:15.408
<i>then make for the north stairs.</i>

26:36.678 --> 26:38.225
What the devil?

27:01.954 --> 27:04.582
Thank you. I should go.
I shouldn't be here.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.672
Aye.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.845
Ye shouldna be here.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.145
But since ye are,

27:19.096 --> 27:20.769
there's a penalty to pay for that.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.324
Get ye gone, lass.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.152
Before ye pay a greater price.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.935
<i>I had to focus and forget about
the incident with Dougal.</i>

28:06.894 --> 28:08.942
<i>15 paces towards the well.</i>

28:09.730 --> 28:13.485
<i>Keep to the northwest to avoid the
sentry, who usually faces scum.</i>

28:44.473 --> 28:47.773
<i>Brimstone is on the right,
fourth stall from the doorway.</i>

28:51.438 --> 28:53.486
Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.360
No, Sassenach. Just me.

29:05.118 --> 29:10.090
How far did ye think ye'd get, lass,
on a dark night with a strange horse,

29:10.165 --> 29:11.917
with half the MacKenzie clan
after ye by morning?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.843
Won't be after me.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.592
They're all up at the hall.

29:15.671 --> 29:18.094
And if one in five of them is sober
enough to stand in the morning,

29:18.173 --> 29:20.050
let alone ride a horse,
then I'll be most surprised.

29:20.133 --> 29:23.182
Running away on a whim
just because the men are drunk?

29:23.262 --> 29:24.684
"On a whim"?

29:25.514 --> 29:27.437
You know I've wanted
to leave here for weeks.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.777
And I know exactly how many
sentry posts surround the castle.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.525
And I know how to
make my way through the forest

29:32.604 --> 29:33.947
and find the road back to Inverness.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.616
Well, that's a very sound plan,
Sassenach.

29:36.692 --> 29:37.739
Or would be,

29:37.818 --> 29:41.448
did Colum not post extra guards
through the woods tonight.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.328
He'd hardly leave
the castle undefended,

29:43.407 --> 29:45.409
and the fighting men
of the clan inside it.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.662
I'm going anyway.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.922
The best trackers in the clan
are here.

29:51.581 --> 29:52.707
They'll catch ye.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.461
Colum will not be
calling ye a guest after that.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.387
I don't care.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.719
I need to leave this place.

30:00.340 --> 30:04.595
As you so plainly stated,
I'm an outlander, just a Sassenach.

30:05.053 --> 30:08.227
If I offended ye, I'm sorry, Claire.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.864
I know you didn't mean it like that.
It's just...

30:17.441 --> 30:21.366
I've been planning this escape
for some time,

30:22.237 --> 30:24.865
and to have all my hopes shot to hell
just in a moment, it's...

30:32.748 --> 30:34.091
Come along.

30:36.126 --> 30:38.595
I'll take you back up to the castle.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.477
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

30:46.803 --> 30:50.933
I had an encounter with some
drunken clansmen in the corridor.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.227
They dinna touch ye now?

30:56.730 --> 30:58.073
I can't go back.

31:01.943 --> 31:05.243
Dougal and I were in the corridor
near the kitchen

31:05.322 --> 31:07.245
and he was being for-ward with me,

31:08.617 --> 31:11.621
and I may have walloped him over
the head with a chair or something,

31:11.703 --> 31:12.829
and I think he's unconscious.

31:14.456 --> 31:15.628
Was he drunk?

31:17.501 --> 31:18.627
Very.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.637
Well,

31:25.550 --> 31:28.394
I doubt very much
he'll remember that.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.063
And even if he does,

31:30.138 --> 31:32.641
I doubt he'll be in a rush to bruit
that a lass got the better of him.

31:34.601 --> 31:35.978
Knocked him out cold, huh?

31:37.562 --> 31:39.815
I didn't exactly stick around
to examine him.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.694
Well, I hope ye left a good mark

31:43.777 --> 31:45.404
so he remembers
his error in judgment.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.036
'Tis fine, Sassenach.

31:55.455 --> 31:56.547
Come.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.764
This isn't the way back in.
Where are we going?

32:09.636 --> 32:11.263
There's an opening
to a hidden tunnel.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.598
Found it playing as a bairn.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.183
Here, careful.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.941
Brings us out under the cellar.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.528
Thank you.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.281
For seeing me back safely.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.449
No, lass.

32:27.529 --> 32:31.409
It's me that should be thanking you,
for all yer healing of my scratches.

32:38.039 --> 32:39.507
God's eyes.

32:40.542 --> 32:41.919
If it's not the young lad,

32:42.836 --> 32:44.053
Colum's nephew.

32:44.379 --> 32:45.881
Come late to the oath-taking,
are ye not?

32:46.381 --> 32:47.974
Ye don't want to
miss your turn in front of himself.

32:48.049 --> 32:51.269
Na, let me go
and change first at the cottage.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.812
I'm not decent
going to the oath-taking like this.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.765
Don't worry yourself
about that, laddie.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.270
We will outfit you proper inside.

32:56.349 --> 32:59.068
- Can I keep the lassie for myself?
- Let the lady go!

33:00.604 --> 33:01.947
- Are ye all right?
- Watch out!

33:12.032 --> 33:13.204
Ye dinna have to hit me so hard.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.336
- I was willing to come.
- Aye.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.334
But I dinna want ye
maiming half the clan

33:18.413 --> 33:19.960
while ye were making up yer mind.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.501
Got the rest of yer clothes, Jamie.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.677
Well,

33:27.756 --> 33:30.600
that should be suitable
for the laird's nephew.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.512
You'll be needing this.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.522
"I shine, not burn."

33:40.602 --> 33:43.071
Aye, the MacKenzie motto.

33:47.901 --> 33:49.198
I'm sorry.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.870
Didn't mean for you
to have to stand up for me.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.163
Don't fuss yourself on my account.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.584
- How's your head?
- Fine.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.042
My sister Jenny says
it's harder than an iron pot.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.971
I canna wear this.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.389
I'm not a MacKenzie.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.051
Do ye know my motto' lass?

34:12.759 --> 34:13.976
My clan's, I mean?

34:14.969 --> 34:15.971
No.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.306
I don't even know
what clan you're from.

34:28.650 --> 34:29.822
Find a place in the hall.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.375
<i>"I am ready."</i>

34:37.867 --> 34:39.619
<i>But ready for what?</i>

34:59.514 --> 35:00.982
Jamie's here.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.950
Why is everyone so tense?

35:11.026 --> 35:12.653
What's going on?

35:12.736 --> 35:14.204
- Why?
- I'll tell ye.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.621
If Jamie pledges fealty
to his uncle, Colum,

35:19.701 --> 35:21.874
then he'd be in line
to succeed as laird.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.914
He'd be part of clan MacKenzie,
ye see?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.917
Why wouldn't Hamish become laird?

35:27.000 --> 35:28.593
If he's too young, then Dougal?

35:28.668 --> 35:30.716
That may be the way
the English do things.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.593
But clans are tanist.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.304
Jamie has MacKenzie blood.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.600
If enough clansmen
want Jamie to be laird,

35:43.683 --> 35:45.105
then there it would be,

35:45.185 --> 35:46.983
and a terrible thing at that.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.363
Mr. MacTavish seems like
a good choice to be laird.

35:57.405 --> 36:01.581
His other uncle, Dougal, might
disagree with ye on that point, lass.

36:02.118 --> 36:05.418
He's been holding the honor
for himself when Colum dies.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.545
If Jamie takes the oath,

36:07.624 --> 36:09.843
Dougal wouldna let him
breathe MacKenzie air for long.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.633
So why doesn't he just
decline to take the oath?

36:13.380 --> 36:15.678
Not while he abides at Leoch.

36:15.757 --> 36:18.636
As the laird's nephew,
and as a healthy man at arms,

36:18.718 --> 36:20.345
he has no choice.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.056
If before all Jamie refuses,

36:23.807 --> 36:24.854
the maids would likely be

36:24.933 --> 36:28.153
scrubbing the lad's blood
from the floor at Colum's feet.

36:28.812 --> 36:31.031
So no matter what he decides,
he winds up dead?

36:32.107 --> 36:34.155
Why stay at the castle?
Why didn't he just leave

36:34.234 --> 36:36.612
if both his uncles
would have his head on a pike?

36:36.695 --> 36:38.538
The lads got a price on his head.

36:38.613 --> 36:39.705
Would not be long before

36:39.781 --> 36:41.783
Captain Randall or the watch
had him in irons.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.712
The only safe place in Scotland
is here at Leoch.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.383
Until now.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.547
If Jamie had just stayed hidden
till the gathering was over,

36:54.629 --> 36:57.098
Colum and Dougal wouldna
pressed the matter any further.

36:59.968 --> 37:02.016
So leaving the stables
to escort me back...

37:02.762 --> 37:04.105
Oh, God, this is all my fault.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.142
Aye.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.397
It is.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.097
Colum MacKenzie,

37:47.098 --> 37:48.566
I come to you as kinsman

37:49.517 --> 37:50.894
and as ally.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.275
But I give ye no vow.

38:04.032 --> 38:07.787
For my oath is pledged
to the name that I bear.

38:19.172 --> 38:22.346
I give you my obedience as Kinsman.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.889
And as laird.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.319
And I hold myself bound to yer word,

38:33.895 --> 38:38.275
so long as my feet rest on
the lands of the clan MacKenzie.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.670
You're too old for this.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.400
'Tis a braw day for a boar tynchal,
is it no?

40:41.439 --> 40:43.066
It's quite the show of force
for a pig hunt.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.452
It's a boar.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.949
Of course.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.281
Twenty men armed
with spears and muskets.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.834
Seems about right
to kill one hairy pig.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.709
You've plainly never seen one then.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.708
Get yer mount.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.793
Time to go.

42:28.755 --> 42:29.847
Mistress Claire!

42:34.010 --> 42:35.227
Serves you right.

42:35.303 --> 42:36.520
What'd you expect
the poor animal to do

42:36.596 --> 42:38.439
with you barbarians chasing it?

42:38.514 --> 42:40.562
Did you forget
their tusks could be lethal?

42:41.309 --> 42:43.277
Bring him back up to the castle,

42:43.352 --> 42:45.946
and tell Mrs. Fitz to give him some
hot broth and some blankets.

42:46.022 --> 42:49.026
It'll need to be stitched, but I
don't have any sterile tools here.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.485
So he'll be all right then?

42:51.152 --> 42:52.825
Yes. You'll have a limp.

42:53.654 --> 42:54.621
Score one for the pig.

42:54.697 --> 42:57.450
Maybe next time
you'll think about going fishing.

43:00.453 --> 43:02.205
All right, take him back now.

43:03.414 --> 43:04.415
Lass.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.209
Wait for me.

43:07.043 --> 43:08.044
Wait!

43:18.012 --> 43:19.605
Where are you?

43:55.341 --> 43:57.139
Now then.
Now then, Geordie, now then.

43:57.218 --> 43:59.141
You're gonna be all right.

43:59.220 --> 44:00.938
I've got you, man, okay?

44:01.013 --> 44:02.390
You'll be all right.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.481
Dougal, is it bad?

44:13.484 --> 44:14.576
You'll be fine.

44:14.902 --> 44:15.903
You're gonna be fine.

44:15.987 --> 44:19.582
<i>It wasn't spurring, which meant
the femoral artery wasn't cut.</i>

44:19.657 --> 44:23.161
<i>So there was a good chance I
could stop the bleeding at the thigh.</i>

44:23.244 --> 44:24.541
Will I lose my leg?

44:24.620 --> 44:26.543
No. No, you won't.

44:27.206 --> 44:30.176
<i>But that would only allow him
to linger in increasing agony.</i>

44:32.128 --> 44:33.175
<i>The wound to his abdomen</i>

44:34.589 --> 44:35.841
<i>was fatal.</i>

44:54.442 --> 44:55.534
Here.

45:06.287 --> 45:09.131
<i>A better death, perhaps,
was what Dougal was giving him.</i>

45:09.790 --> 45:11.633
<i>To die cleanly under this sky,</i>

45:12.293 --> 45:14.261
<i>his heart's blood
staining the same leaves</i>

45:14.337 --> 45:16.510
<i>dyed by the blood of the beast
that killed him.</i>

45:17.256 --> 45:19.429
- Dougal, man.
- Aye, I'm here.

45:20.468 --> 45:21.685
I need to know,

45:22.678 --> 45:26.854
after we raided the clan MacDonald

45:27.475 --> 45:30.194
and stole the 20 kine
from under their noses...

45:30.519 --> 45:31.771
Aye, I remember.

45:32.939 --> 45:34.907
We held up at Florrach for days.

45:36.484 --> 45:38.953
- But we ate well, no?
- Aye.

45:39.028 --> 45:40.496
Aye, we did for sure.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.200
Tell me here now, man.

45:45.785 --> 45:47.662
Did you bed my sister Doreen?

45:51.832 --> 45:54.255
Aye. I did bed her.

45:57.213 --> 45:58.635
But, you know, she was a bonny lass.

45:58.714 --> 46:00.091
I ken it.

46:01.717 --> 46:03.640
You always could charm the lasses.

46:09.684 --> 46:10.856
It will be better soon.

46:11.686 --> 46:13.188
The pain will be gone soon.

46:17.358 --> 46:18.780
It feels better now.

46:24.323 --> 46:25.950
I canna feel my leg anymore, Dougal.

46:30.496 --> 46:31.793
My hands neither.

46:34.542 --> 46:35.714
Dougal, are you there, man?

46:35.793 --> 46:37.716
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

46:38.212 --> 46:39.509
I've got you.

46:40.673 --> 46:41.799
Geordie.

46:46.262 --> 46:47.388
Tell me about your home.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.734
It's near a wide glen.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.858
Not far from Loch Fannich.

47:00.234 --> 47:01.611
What's it like there?

47:02.695 --> 47:04.117
I'll wager it's beautiful.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.537
Tis.

47:10.202 --> 47:11.545
In the spring...

47:12.413 --> 47:13.665
Yes?

47:16.876 --> 47:18.469
The heather's so thick,

47:19.253 --> 47:22.223
ye can walk across the tops
without touching the ground.

47:23.257 --> 47:24.600
That sounds lovely.

47:26.635 --> 47:28.137
Wish I could be there now.

47:29.889 --> 47:31.436
You'll be there soon, lad.

47:32.933 --> 47:34.105
Aye.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.487
Will ye stay with me?

47:37.563 --> 47:39.190
- Aye.
- Yes.

47:48.741 --> 47:51.290
There you are. There.

48:47.675 --> 48:48.972
Get the ball!

48:49.051 --> 48:50.769
Pass it! Pass it!

49:38.893 --> 49:40.691
I taught you this game' lad.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.192
That ye did.

49:51.363 --> 49:52.910
Murtagh!

50:06.253 --> 50:07.755
Didn't look very fair.

50:12.551 --> 50:14.019
That's twice ye caught me napping.

50:19.600 --> 50:20.772
Yield!

50:21.393 --> 50:23.737
- What would you think of me if I did?
- Not much.

50:28.108 --> 50:29.530
Play fair now.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.353
Ye taught me well.

51:01.350 --> 51:03.478
Aye. Too well.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.287
Did we win?

51:22.746 --> 51:24.419
<i>My escape attempt thwarted,</i>

51:24.498 --> 51:26.751
<i>I was faced with
the terrifying possibility</i>

51:26.834 --> 51:29.508
<i>that I was destined to stay
in this dungeon forever.</i>

51:36.176 --> 51:37.769
<i>I wasn't ready to give up,</i>

51:37.845 --> 51:40.018
<i>but I needed time
to come up with another plan.</i>

51:42.349 --> 51:44.647
You've seen men die before

51:44.727 --> 51:46.104
and by violence.

51:48.314 --> 51:49.361
Yes.

51:49.857 --> 51:51.029
Many of them.

52:05.581 --> 52:07.128
Ye've done a fine job here as healer.

52:10.419 --> 52:13.969
Mrs. Fitz would have ye sit
for a portrait if it was up to her.

52:19.720 --> 52:23.350
And I wanted to thank you personally

52:24.558 --> 52:26.731
for what you did for poor Geordie
up there on the hunt.

52:28.812 --> 52:30.780
In truth, I did nothing.

52:31.732 --> 52:33.985
- I wish I could have helped him.
- Ye did.

52:35.778 --> 52:37.576
Ye took him to a peaceful place,

52:38.405 --> 52:40.578
and that's all any of us
can ask when we pass.

52:40.658 --> 52:43.127
So, thank you.

52:47.331 --> 52:48.878
You're welcome.

52:54.129 --> 52:56.848
If there's nothing else,
you'll have to excuse me.

52:56.924 --> 52:59.177
I've a lotto do here in my dungeon.

53:00.386 --> 53:01.808
Well,

53:02.513 --> 53:06.689
that's why I'm here, lass,
to set ye free from this dank room.

53:09.603 --> 53:11.571
- What do you mean?
- You're coming on the road.

53:12.189 --> 53:13.236
"On the road"?

53:13.315 --> 53:15.613
I'm leaving tomorrow,
and I'm taking you with me.

53:18.278 --> 53:19.404
Taking me where?

53:20.823 --> 53:23.497
Traveling through MacKenzie lands,
collecting rents.

53:24.243 --> 53:26.371
Colum doesna travel,

53:26.453 --> 53:29.127
so visiting the tenants and tacksmen
that can't come to the gathering,

53:29.206 --> 53:31.629
that falls to me,

53:31.709 --> 53:34.462
and attending to a wee bit
of business here and there.

53:36.130 --> 53:37.473
But why me?

53:38.632 --> 53:42.887
I think it would be wise
to have a healer along,

53:43.804 --> 53:46.648
especially one that
does well under strain.

53:47.307 --> 53:49.309
And there's a lot of that
on the road.

53:52.438 --> 53:54.657
So that's the business settled.

53:55.649 --> 53:57.902
Mrs. Fitz will have supper ready,

53:57.985 --> 54:00.579
and ye don't want to incur her wrath
by coming late.

54:02.364 --> 54:04.332
We leave at first light.

54:41.945 --> 54:45.950
<i>As the confines of the castle walls
faded behind me like a bad dream,</i>

54:46.533 --> 54:48.956
<i>I took my first full breath in weeks.</i>

54:49.870 --> 54:52.840
<i>I had no idea
where this journey would lead me,</i>

54:52.915 --> 54:55.168
<i>what opportunity
might present itself</i>

54:56.001 --> 54:58.003
<i>I could only hope
it would bring me closer</i>

54:58.086 --> 55:00.305
<i>to the standing stones
of Craigh na Dun.</i>

55:01.381 --> 55:04.806
<i>If so,
I was determined to reach them,</i>

55:04.885 --> 55:08.264
<i>knowing this time I must not fail.</i>
