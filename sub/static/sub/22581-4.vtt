WEBVTT

00:09.927 --> 00:13.555
- How can you eat that stuff?
- It's healthier than that.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.474
At least this tastes like something.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.893
I guess it just takes
a more discriminating palate

00:18.101 --> 00:20.187
to appreciate Vulcan cuisine.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.774
Do you know there are
over 5,000 subspecies

00:23.982 --> 00:26.651
of termites on Loracus Prime?

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.830 --> 00:40.749
I thought we were headed
for a nebula.

00:41.374 --> 00:44.502
- Anybody hear about this?
- Not a word.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.213
I wonder if somebody lives there.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.467
There's a lot of plant life.
It might be an oxygen atmosphere.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.636
What do you think? First Contact?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.722
I don't see any cities or agriculture.

00:55.972 --> 00:58.391
Maybe they live underground
or in the water.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.935
Is that snow on those mountains?

01:01.144 --> 01:03.938
You'd think the captain would make
an announcement or something.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.024
Well, call him.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.860
T'Pol?

01:09.068 --> 01:12.572
Seventeen percent oxygen.
Eighty-one percent nitrogen.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.199
Sounds like home.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.867
Any people?

01:16.117 --> 01:20.330
The planet supports a diverse ecology,
but there are no signs of humanoid life.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.958
Still, someone may have
a claim on it.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.836
We don't wanna go
waltzing into their back yard.

01:27.378 --> 01:32.550
Scan for marker buoys,
beacons, man-made satellites.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.427
None in range, sir.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.888
Looks like no one's
planted a flag just yet.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.434
Prep a shuttlepod, Mr Tucker.

01:42.226 --> 01:44.604
I like the looks
of the northern continent.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.689
See if you can find a good place
to set down.

01:46.939 --> 01:49.817
- Yes, sir.
- Captain?

01:50.067 --> 01:53.029
There are a number of protocols
you may want to consider.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.488
Protocols?

01:54.739 --> 01:56.073
Vulcan ships would begin

01:56.282 --> 01:59.869
by sending automated probes down
to collect more detailed scans.

02:00.119 --> 02:02.413
If the planet proved to be
Minshara-class,

02:02.622 --> 02:05.416
we would then conduct
a geophysical survey from orbit.

02:05.624 --> 02:09.252
- Minshara-class?
- Suitable for humanoid life.

02:09.878 --> 02:13.716
- How long would all that take?
- Six or seven days.

02:13.966 --> 02:18.929
You expect us to sit up here for
a week while probes have all the fun?

02:19.430 --> 02:24.602
This planet has been here a long time.
It will still be here in seven days.

02:24.852 --> 02:29.231
I understand that you have
a more cautious approach.

02:29.481 --> 02:34.445
But we didn't come out here
to tiptoe around. Get the pod ready.

02:34.695 --> 02:37.781
I'd like you to put together
the survey team.

02:38.574 --> 02:41.118
I assume that's not
a violation of protocol.

02:45.622 --> 02:50.961
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

02:53.422 --> 02:56.842
"It's been a long time"

02:57.050 --> 03:00.888
"But my time is finally near"

03:01.096 --> 03:05.350
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

03:05.559 --> 03:08.478
"I will touch the sky"

03:08.687 --> 03:12.482
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

03:12.691 --> 03:15.694
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

03:15.902 --> 03:20.615
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

03:20.824 --> 03:23.744
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

03:23.952 --> 03:28.540
"I've got faith to believe"

03:28.749 --> 03:31.334
"I can do anything"

03:31.543 --> 03:36.047
"I've got strength of the soul"

03:36.256 --> 03:39.134
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

03:39.342 --> 03:44.681
"I can reach any star"

03:45.056 --> 03:48.810
"I've got faith"

03:49.019 --> 03:52.731
"I've got faith"

03:52.939 --> 03:57.736
"Faith of the heart"

04:18.464 --> 04:20.007
Thanks.

04:22.302 --> 04:23.970
I tried some plomeek broth
this morning.

04:24.220 --> 04:27.307
It was very good. Vulcan food is...

04:27.515 --> 04:28.641
...interesting.

04:29.350 --> 04:31.311
Did you sterilize
the sample containers?

04:31.519 --> 04:33.187
Yes.

04:38.109 --> 04:40.111
Thanks for choosing me
for this mission.

04:40.361 --> 04:43.156
You were selected because
your specialty is entomology.

04:43.406 --> 04:46.909
This planet has
a diverse insect population.

04:47.452 --> 04:49.620
Great.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.626
You'd have better luck
making friends with a housefly.

04:55.835 --> 04:57.670
I know.

05:13.310 --> 05:14.979
Wow.

05:15.229 --> 05:19.316
- Worth every light-year.
- Set us down just east of those hills.

05:19.567 --> 05:20.901
Aye, sir.

05:39.378 --> 05:42.464
Where no dog has gone before.

05:43.048 --> 05:45.592
I almost forgot
what fresh air smells like.

05:45.843 --> 05:48.804
The atmosphere contains trace
elements of nitrogen dioxide,

05:49.054 --> 05:51.306
- chloromethane...
- Put that thing away.

05:51.515 --> 05:54.393
Take a minute to enjoy yourself.

05:55.936 --> 05:58.397
The sky ever get this blue
on Vulcan?

05:58.605 --> 06:00.441
Occasionally.

06:01.150 --> 06:04.361
We're walking on an alien world,
light-years from Earth or Vulcan.

06:04.570 --> 06:05.779
Doesn't that impress you?

06:05.988 --> 06:09.116
I've been to
36 Minshara-class planets.

06:09.366 --> 06:11.618
This experience
is only marginally different.

06:11.869 --> 06:14.496
Perfect. Hold it right there.

06:17.165 --> 06:19.084
Smile.

06:20.836 --> 06:23.964
Be sure to get a copy of that
to the Vulcan High Command.

06:26.216 --> 06:29.886
You have your assignments.
We'll rendezvous here at 1900 hours.

06:30.095 --> 06:33.598
Unless the captain wants us
to pose for more pictures.

07:07.841 --> 07:11.344
I'm afraid my log entry
isn't gonna do this justice.

07:11.553 --> 07:13.888
A cabin in these woods
would be nice.

07:14.139 --> 07:17.600
Three weeks in deep space,
you're ready to jump ship?

07:17.851 --> 07:22.188
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.
You guys would be lost without me.

07:22.397 --> 07:23.606
It's beautiful, all right.

07:23.815 --> 07:26.818
But I couldn't call a place home unless
it came with a pair of warp nacelles.

07:27.902 --> 07:29.821
Boomers.

07:32.282 --> 07:35.576
- Archer.
- Is there a problem, captain?

07:35.785 --> 07:37.620
No, no problem. Why?

07:37.829 --> 07:40.373
We were scheduled
to rendezvous 15 minutes ago.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.672
Sorry. We lost track of time.

07:48.089 --> 07:49.966
We'll be right there.

07:56.097 --> 07:58.558
We've identified
several nocturnal marsupials.

07:58.766 --> 08:00.852
I'd like to keep Crewmen Cutler
and Novakovich

08:01.060 --> 08:03.020
with me overnight to study them.

08:03.229 --> 08:05.565
I'm glad to see you're getting
in the spirit of things.

08:05.773 --> 08:08.484
- Pick you up in the morning.
- Captain, if it's all right with you,

08:08.734 --> 08:11.612
- Travis and I would like to stay as well.
- We would?

08:11.821 --> 08:14.699
When was the last time
you slept under the stars?

08:14.907 --> 08:16.617
There's plenty of camping gear
in the pod.

08:16.867 --> 08:19.328
This isn't shore leave.
This is a research mission.

08:19.537 --> 08:22.081
Why can't it be a little bit of both?

08:22.331 --> 08:25.418
Research isn't the only reason
we're out here.

08:26.168 --> 08:29.672
- Pitch your tent, commander.
- Thanks, captain.

08:29.922 --> 08:32.799
Don't worry.
We'll keep out of your hair.

08:37.179 --> 08:38.764
Keep in mind,
those cargo vessels

08:38.972 --> 08:41.517
weren't equipped
for rescue operations.

08:41.725 --> 08:45.980
So the captain wasn't sure what to do
when he picked up the distress call.

08:46.647 --> 08:49.942
But it wasn't a ship
that sent the signal.

08:50.276 --> 08:55.447
It was a life pod. From one
of the old Y-500-class freighters.

08:55.698 --> 08:58.450
- Those were retired decades ago.
- Exactly.

08:58.701 --> 09:04.289
The pod had been drifting in space
for 63 years.

09:04.540 --> 09:08.335
Bio-scans showed
one life sign inside the pod.

09:08.585 --> 09:10.295
Human.

09:10.546 --> 09:12.881
The assistant engineer,
George Webb,

09:13.090 --> 09:16.593
a friend of my uncle's,
was assigned to open it.

09:17.594 --> 09:20.889
Took him over an hour
to cut through the hull.

09:21.682 --> 09:25.477
He said the metal felt strange.

09:25.727 --> 09:28.105
Cold to the touch.

09:28.313 --> 09:31.608
Of course it was cold.
It was floating in space for 60 years.

09:32.317 --> 09:36.571
He could hear a tapping noise
coming from inside.

09:36.947 --> 09:39.699
But when he finally got it open...

09:40.158 --> 09:41.660
...the pod was empty.

09:42.244 --> 09:44.121
No body. Nothing.

09:44.746 --> 09:47.666
A few days later,
Webb started acting strange.

09:47.916 --> 09:49.960
Getting into fights with the crew,

09:50.210 --> 09:54.214
muttering to himself
in some sort of alien language.

09:54.464 --> 09:58.051
Then one day,
he locked himself in Engineering

09:58.260 --> 10:02.889
and overloaded the impulse reactors.
He almost destroyed the ship.

10:04.516 --> 10:08.645
Then he sealed himself
in a life pod and ejected it.

10:09.896 --> 10:11.690
I assume the captain
went after him.

10:12.399 --> 10:14.359
The reactors were
too badly damaged.

10:15.694 --> 10:20.448
Some people say it was
an alien life form that got into him.

10:20.698 --> 10:24.202
Others think it was
the ghost of a dead crewman.

10:24.661 --> 10:27.330
I never knew what to believe.

10:27.747 --> 10:31.876
But Webb is still out there, drifting.

10:32.794 --> 10:35.380
When the subspace noise
is real low,

10:35.588 --> 10:40.551
some com officers say they can
still hear the echo of his distress call.

10:41.135 --> 10:42.136
Beep.

10:43.888 --> 10:45.181
Beep.

10:51.688 --> 10:53.940
It's highly doubtful
that a distress beacon

10:54.190 --> 10:57.485
could function continuously
for 63 years.

11:00.154 --> 11:01.989
Let me guess.

11:02.573 --> 11:04.784
No ghost stories on Vulcan.

11:05.993 --> 11:07.620
That's it.

11:08.329 --> 11:10.790
To the left of that trinary cluster.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.125
- What?
- Our sun.

11:13.334 --> 11:16.754
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Positive.

11:17.004 --> 11:19.882
Just another speck of light.

11:20.132 --> 11:22.593
No different than any other.

11:22.843 --> 11:26.138
When I was a kid,
I'd go camping with my buddies.

11:26.931 --> 11:30.351
We'd spend half the night
looking up at the stars,

11:30.601 --> 11:33.729
wondering what our own sun
would look like from this far away.

11:34.814 --> 11:36.357
Now you know.

11:38.734 --> 11:41.612
- Are you okay?
- Headache.

11:41.862 --> 11:43.322
If it's all right with you,

11:43.531 --> 11:45.991
I'd like to lie down for a while
before we get back to work.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.494
Certainly.

11:52.665 --> 11:55.960
Has anyone heard the one
about the haunted comet?

11:57.503 --> 11:59.588
Wait a minute.
You notice something?

12:00.172 --> 12:01.882
Fireflies are gone.

12:02.132 --> 12:04.927
Nice going, Travis.
You scared off the bugs.

12:05.761 --> 12:09.264
Maybe it's the ghost
of George Webb.

12:12.559 --> 12:14.603
Looks like we might
have ourselves a little weather.

12:15.187 --> 12:17.606
A front is approaching
from the southwest.

12:26.740 --> 12:29.201
It must be gusting at 80 kph.

12:29.409 --> 12:30.953
This is nothing compared
to a hurricane

12:31.161 --> 12:32.829
coming up through
the Florida Keys.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.625
Try flying through an ion storm
at warp 2.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.127
Did you hear that?

12:39.795 --> 12:42.381
- What?
- Someone's out there.

12:43.215 --> 12:45.217
It's the wind.

12:57.521 --> 12:59.356
- Oh, son of a bitch!
- What is it?

12:59.564 --> 13:01.775
There's something in my bag.

13:02.734 --> 13:04.653
- Give me your boot.
- What for?

13:04.861 --> 13:05.862
So I can squash it.

13:06.071 --> 13:07.822
Are we allowed to squash
alien life forms?

13:08.031 --> 13:10.158
If they're inside your sleeping bag.

13:11.368 --> 13:14.079
There it is. Wait a minute.

13:14.329 --> 13:16.831
- Where'd you put the phase pistols?
- You wanna shoot a bug?

13:17.040 --> 13:19.834
- I'm just gonna stun it.
- T'Pol to Tucker.

13:20.085 --> 13:22.962
- Go ahead.
- Is there a problem, commander?

13:23.213 --> 13:26.257
Oh, no, just an 8-inch scorpion thing
inside our tent.

13:26.508 --> 13:30.011
- Do you require assistance?
- I think I've got it under control.

13:30.261 --> 13:31.805
No, not there. It's over there.

13:34.682 --> 13:37.852
T'Pol, you said you found
a cave this afternoon.

13:38.102 --> 13:42.732
- Less than half a kilometre from here.
- I think we're gonna need it.

13:47.987 --> 13:49.614
Come in.

13:52.492 --> 13:56.829
Nice catch.
You'd make a good 2-metre man.

13:57.038 --> 13:58.623
Too bad we don't have
a pool onboard.

13:59.207 --> 14:00.291
A shame.

14:01.084 --> 14:03.544
A windstorm's moving across
the northern continent.

14:03.753 --> 14:05.797
- It looks like a nasty one.
- Survey team?

14:06.005 --> 14:08.466
They've taken shelter,
but I'd recommend pulling them out.

14:08.674 --> 14:11.135
I've got a shuttlepod on standby.

14:12.178 --> 14:14.597
- Archer to T'Pol.
- Yes, captain.

14:14.847 --> 14:17.934
- What's your status?
- We've relocated into a cavern.

14:18.142 --> 14:20.561
Mr Reed thinks we should
come down and get you.

14:20.811 --> 14:23.689
A landing under these conditions
might be difficult.

14:23.898 --> 14:26.025
We'll be protected
until the winds diminish.

14:26.651 --> 14:30.071
We'll keep an eye on the storm.
Let us know if you need anything.

14:30.279 --> 14:32.114
Understood.

14:33.491 --> 14:35.326
Keep the pod on standby.

14:35.576 --> 14:38.537
- Just in case.
- Aye, sir.

14:40.498 --> 14:43.417
- Who's got the food packs?
- Nope.

14:43.667 --> 14:46.295
- Travis?
- Not me, sir.

14:46.545 --> 14:48.547
We must have left them
at the campsite.

14:48.797 --> 14:50.424
I'll go.

14:50.799 --> 14:52.426
Be careful.

15:28.921 --> 15:30.756
Trip?

15:38.555 --> 15:40.390
Hello?

15:44.478 --> 15:47.856
- Was anybody outside just now?
- Just you. Why?

15:48.106 --> 15:51.026
- There's someone else out there.
- What?

15:51.276 --> 15:53.278
Near the campsite.

15:53.528 --> 15:55.530
I think we've had enough
ghost stories for one night.

15:55.781 --> 15:57.407
It's no story.

15:57.616 --> 15:59.993
We've scanned the planet.
It's uninhabited.

16:00.202 --> 16:05.457
- I'm telling you, I saw three people.
- Three? What did they look like?

16:05.707 --> 16:09.377
- It was too dark.
- Sub-commander?

16:09.878 --> 16:13.381
Other than ourselves,
there are no humanoid life forms here.

16:13.590 --> 16:15.550
There could be something
wrong with your scanner.

16:15.759 --> 16:18.928
It's functioning perfectly.
Perhaps you imagined seeing them.

16:19.137 --> 16:21.348
They looked pretty real to me.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.476
Ethan?

16:24.684 --> 16:27.437
There's someone back there.
I heard voices.

16:27.645 --> 16:30.190
Are you gonna tell me
I'm imagining things too?

16:30.398 --> 16:32.150
- It's not safe here.
- We don't know that.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.359
They could be friendly.

16:33.610 --> 16:35.779
Why are they hiding? Why
don't they come and say hello?

16:35.987 --> 16:39.282
- We should leave.
- Where do you propose we go?

16:39.491 --> 16:42.619
- Back out into the storm?
- It's better than being trapped in here.

16:42.827 --> 16:46.331
Slow down, crewman.
That's an order.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.043
Ethan!

16:51.502 --> 16:53.338
Stay here.

16:55.673 --> 16:57.508
Travis.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.188
- I'll be back shortly.
- Where are you going?

17:10.438 --> 17:14.942
If there's someone back there,
I intend to find them.

17:43.888 --> 17:46.348
Ethan!

17:58.819 --> 18:00.654
Travis!

18:01.864 --> 18:03.490
I saw one.

18:05.659 --> 18:08.412
It came right out of that rock
like it was a part of it.

18:08.662 --> 18:12.583
That could explain why they're not
showing up on our scanners.

18:56.168 --> 18:58.920
It's too dangerous.
We should go back.

19:24.446 --> 19:26.281
Who were they?

19:26.698 --> 19:28.325
Excuse me?

19:28.533 --> 19:31.411
Well, who were you talking to?

19:31.828 --> 19:34.039
Talking to?

19:34.247 --> 19:36.291
There's no one here.

19:39.502 --> 19:42.213
We've lost Novakovich,
and we're apparently not alone.

19:42.422 --> 19:44.674
There's some kind of life form
down here.

19:44.924 --> 19:49.053
- Can you make it back to the cavern?
- We're heading there now, sir.

19:51.514 --> 19:54.267
The captain's on his way.
We're getting out of here.

19:54.475 --> 19:56.185
Not a moment too soon.

19:56.394 --> 19:59.480
From what I saw,
these things live inside the rock.

19:59.731 --> 20:02.191
I performed a geological analysis.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.069
The rocks are composed
of limestone and cormalite.

20:05.278 --> 20:06.696
Nothing more.

20:06.904 --> 20:10.199
She's lying, commander.
I saw her talking to them.

20:10.408 --> 20:13.536
- Crewman?
- In there. There were two of them.

20:13.745 --> 20:16.956
- She's mistaken.
- No, I'm not.

20:17.165 --> 20:19.625
Why won't you tell us
what's going on?

20:20.001 --> 20:21.419
What do they want?

20:25.298 --> 20:28.175
I've got a fix.
Twenty kilometres northeast.

20:28.426 --> 20:31.095
Archer to Novakovich.

20:31.637 --> 20:35.641
- Ethan, respond.
- Who's there? Who is that?

20:35.891 --> 20:38.519
This is Captain Archer.
We're attempting to land.

20:38.728 --> 20:41.689
- I want you to get back to the cavern.
- Go to hell!

20:45.484 --> 20:48.446
- I have no reason to deceive you.
- Neither does she.

20:48.654 --> 20:50.448
You keep claiming these creatures
don't exist,

20:50.656 --> 20:54.076
but the rest of us have all seen them.
That's a little strange, don't you think?

20:54.285 --> 20:55.828
I can't explain what you've seen,

20:56.036 --> 20:58.247
but I assure you,
I didn't speak to anyone.

20:58.455 --> 21:00.207
I'd like to believe you.

21:00.416 --> 21:02.877
But you Vulcans don't exactly
have a spotless track record

21:03.085 --> 21:04.795
when it comes to
being honest with us.

21:05.796 --> 21:09.550
- Your point?
- You've held things back before.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.468
You might be doing it again.

21:15.139 --> 21:16.140
Tucker here.

21:16.348 --> 21:18.475
We're closing in
on your position, Trip.

21:18.684 --> 21:22.813
There's a clearing 100 metres
from the cave entrance. Get to it.

21:29.653 --> 21:32.030
I'm reading them.
Two kilometres due west.

21:32.281 --> 21:34.032
I'm taking us down.

21:41.748 --> 21:44.626
There's a lot of wind shear
near the surface.

21:45.252 --> 21:48.797
Activate the auxiliary
landing thrusters.

21:49.339 --> 21:51.300
Altitude 70 metres.

21:55.304 --> 21:56.513
Forty metres.

22:03.311 --> 22:05.230
I'll have to try a different vector.

22:10.861 --> 22:12.988
- Starboard.
- I see it.

22:17.659 --> 22:19.286
Thruster four's down.

22:19.494 --> 22:22.414
- We're leaking plasma coolant.
- Almost there.

22:22.622 --> 22:25.917
Sir, we can't safely land
in this wind with a thruster out.

22:33.049 --> 22:35.176
- Archer to Tucker.
- Captain.

22:35.385 --> 22:37.220
Aren't you forgetting something?

22:37.470 --> 22:40.390
We're gonna have to wait
till the wind dies down.

22:41.266 --> 22:44.602
- Try to manage till then.
- We'll do our best, sir.

22:44.853 --> 22:48.064
If you run across any more
of these aliens, try to make contact.

22:48.314 --> 22:49.774
See what you can find out
about them.

22:49.983 --> 22:51.609
Understood.

23:10.712 --> 23:12.880
You okay?

23:13.715 --> 23:15.341
Never better.

23:17.176 --> 23:21.764
You heard the captain.
He wants to know about your friends.

23:22.014 --> 23:24.267
What are you gonna tell him?

23:25.184 --> 23:27.436
What are you gonna tell him?

23:30.356 --> 23:32.608
- This is pointless.
- Is it?

23:32.859 --> 23:34.652
We're stuck down here
for God knows how long,

23:34.860 --> 23:38.072
with rock people, who, for all we know,
are staring at us from these walls now.

23:38.322 --> 23:41.409
Not to mention a crewman out there
who probably won't last the night.

23:41.617 --> 23:44.745
Now, if we're gonna get through this, I
need to know what the hell's going on.

23:44.954 --> 23:46.163
You beginning to see my point?

23:46.372 --> 23:49.250
I share your concern for Crewman
Novakovich, but as I told you...

23:49.458 --> 23:52.128
You couldn't care less about him,
or any of the rest of us.

23:52.378 --> 23:55.089
That would require some of those
useless human emotions.

23:55.339 --> 23:58.467
Your emotions are beginning
to affect your judgment.

23:58.676 --> 24:01.345
You're becoming irrational.

24:01.554 --> 24:04.515
- You've never seen me irrational.
- Sir?

24:05.141 --> 24:08.185
I hate to add to our problems,
but we're running low on water.

24:09.019 --> 24:10.646
Great.

24:11.438 --> 24:14.942
- We'll have to conserve what's left.
- That won't be necessary.

24:15.150 --> 24:17.528
I detected water about 60 metres
in that direction.

24:17.736 --> 24:21.240
How do we know you're not
going in there to talk to your friends?

24:22.491 --> 24:24.410
Join me if you'd like.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.203
It could be a trap, commander.

24:30.082 --> 24:33.460
I can survive without water
for several days.

24:34.128 --> 24:35.337
Can you?

24:36.922 --> 24:38.298
Sit down.

24:40.843 --> 24:43.095
You heard me.

24:55.941 --> 24:56.942
How's he doing?

24:57.192 --> 24:59.653
Not good.
His bio-signs are very erratic.

24:59.861 --> 25:01.697
Try him again.

25:01.905 --> 25:03.573
Enterprise to Novakovich.

25:03.949 --> 25:07.077
Can you hear me? Ethan.

25:14.501 --> 25:16.461
Mr Reed.
Can you get a lock on him?

25:16.711 --> 25:18.755
- Yes, sir.
- Looks like our only choice.

25:18.964 --> 25:20.715
Understood. Stand by.

25:25.637 --> 25:26.763
There's a problem, sir.

25:27.389 --> 25:29.099
There are contaminants
in the matter stream.

25:29.307 --> 25:32.894
The phase discriminator can't
seem to isolate the debris.

25:36.982 --> 25:39.234
Reed to Sickbay.

25:39.859 --> 25:41.903
Medical emergency.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.199
What are you doing?

25:46.408 --> 25:49.160
- Working.
- On what?

25:49.411 --> 25:51.746
Scans I took this afternoon.

25:51.996 --> 25:53.873
Find anything
you wanna tell me about?

25:54.499 --> 25:56.960
There's nothing of
scientific interest on this planet.

25:57.168 --> 25:59.087
Our mission here
was a waste of time.

25:59.295 --> 26:01.756
That's what you'd like us to think.

26:03.049 --> 26:05.510
- Let me see that thing.
- The readings are in Vulcan.

26:05.718 --> 26:09.013
- You won't understand them.
- No. But Hoshi would.

26:11.057 --> 26:12.308
This could be evidence.

26:12.558 --> 26:16.145
- Of what?
- Your little conspiracy.

26:16.396 --> 26:19.816
I was wrong.
There is something of interest here.

26:20.024 --> 26:22.735
I've learned a great deal
about human behaviour.

26:23.986 --> 26:25.822
Under stress, you become volatile.

26:26.030 --> 26:29.117
You're a far more dangerous species
than I previously believed.

26:29.367 --> 26:32.870
Your people have been telling us
that kind of crap for 100 years.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.790
Looks like you finally found a way
to put us back in our cage.

26:36.624 --> 26:40.545
- Sir?
- Imagine the news back home, Travis.

26:40.795 --> 26:43.881
"Enterprise crew found dead.

26:44.131 --> 26:47.927
Six weeks into their historic voyage,
the bodies of all 82 crewmembers

26:48.135 --> 26:50.096
were located on
an uninhabited world.

26:50.346 --> 26:52.973
A Vulcan ship made
the unfortunate discovery.

26:53.224 --> 26:56.060
Cause of death remains a mystery."

26:56.310 --> 26:59.271
But what the Vulcans won't say
is they know exactly who attacked us.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.190
In fact, they arranged
the whole thing.

27:01.399 --> 27:04.360
They lured us down here
so they could sabotage our mission.

27:04.610 --> 27:07.196
You were the one
who found these caves.

27:07.404 --> 27:09.824
And it was your idea to stay overnight.

27:10.074 --> 27:12.993
I didn't ask you or Mr Tucker
to join us.

27:13.244 --> 27:15.412
We know you're here.

27:15.663 --> 27:18.916
Why don't you show yourselves?
You're not afraid of us, are you?

27:19.124 --> 27:20.751
There's no one there, commander.

27:21.001 --> 27:22.878
Maybe you're waiting for the others
to come down

27:23.087 --> 27:24.922
so you can kill us all at once.

27:25.172 --> 27:28.884
- Did you see that?
- All I see is a delusional engineer.

27:30.761 --> 27:34.264
Sounds like you're getting a little
volatile yourself, sub-commander.

27:34.515 --> 27:37.851
I thought you had your emotions
all locked up.

27:38.102 --> 27:41.021
- Having a little problem, are you?
- Commander, there!

27:43.440 --> 27:45.901
You think I'm gonna wait around here
for you to slaughter us?

27:46.151 --> 27:49.404
I'll blow this whole cave apart
if I have to.

27:50.322 --> 27:52.533
I know you hear me!

27:55.786 --> 27:58.789
Human skin is a resilient organ.

27:59.039 --> 28:00.874
These wounds should heal nicely.

28:01.083 --> 28:03.418
- Can I talk to him?
- Yes.

28:03.627 --> 28:07.756
But I doubt he'll make much sense.
Have you ever heard of tropolisine?

28:07.964 --> 28:09.049
No.

28:09.299 --> 28:12.803
It's a psychotropic compound
known for its hallucinogenic effects.

28:13.011 --> 28:15.889
This crewman's bloodstream
is filled with it.

28:16.098 --> 28:19.309
If it was down on the planet,
why didn't our sensors pick it up?

28:19.518 --> 28:21.561
Normally, it's found in
certain flowering plants.

28:21.770 --> 28:24.105
Perhaps your sensors
weren't calibrated to detect it.

28:24.314 --> 28:27.609
Or perhaps it wasn't there
until that damn wind started.

28:27.859 --> 28:29.486
How long will the effects last?

28:29.736 --> 28:32.113
Now that he's back on Enterprise,
he should be all right

28:32.322 --> 28:34.324
in three or four hours.

28:34.574 --> 28:37.619
- Will this tro...?
- Tropolisine.

28:37.869 --> 28:40.538
- Will it affect T'Pol as well?
- There's no way to know.

28:40.747 --> 28:44.167
It might affect her to a lesser degree,
or a greater degree.

28:48.421 --> 28:50.131
Archer to T'Pol.

28:51.758 --> 28:54.844
- Yes, captain.
- We have Novakovich.

28:55.053 --> 28:57.847
And I have a phase pistol
pointed at my head.

28:58.306 --> 28:59.307
What?

28:59.516 --> 29:01.684
My suspicions were
right on the nose, captain.

29:01.893 --> 29:04.979
Our little Vulcan here is not what she
appears to be. Never was.

29:05.188 --> 29:06.606
What are you talking about?

29:06.814 --> 29:08.441
There's some kind of creatures
down here.

29:08.691 --> 29:11.527
They hide inside solid rock.
Travis and I have both seen them.

29:11.778 --> 29:13.821
Cutler saw two of them
talking to T'Pol.

29:14.030 --> 29:16.157
They're up to something,
but of course, she denies it.

29:16.407 --> 29:18.034
Listen to me.

29:18.326 --> 29:21.704
You've all been exposed
to a psychotropic compound.

29:21.913 --> 29:24.415
It causes heightened anxiety,
hallucinations...

29:24.624 --> 29:26.542
Are you telling me those creatures
aren't real?

29:26.793 --> 29:29.670
The compound comes from
the pollen of a flower.

29:29.879 --> 29:32.590
We think it was blown down from
the mountains when the wind started.

29:32.799 --> 29:34.842
The doctor's run tests
on Novakovich.

29:35.051 --> 29:37.178
He thinks he's gonna be okay
in a few hours.

29:37.386 --> 29:40.681
So if you can get as deep
as you can into the caves,

29:40.932 --> 29:43.392
your symptoms should dissipate
around the same time.

29:43.601 --> 29:45.269
We didn't imagine this, captain.

29:45.770 --> 29:49.649
You dealt with simulations
very close to this in Starfleet training.

29:49.857 --> 29:52.109
You're familiar with
mind-altering agents.

29:52.318 --> 29:55.112
We'll be down to get you
as soon as the winds let up.

29:55.321 --> 29:58.324
You're not here, captain.
You don't understand what's going on.

29:58.574 --> 30:01.160
Put your weapon down, Trip.
That's an order.

30:06.165 --> 30:08.876
- T'Pol?
- He's lowered his phase pistol, sir.

30:09.126 --> 30:12.171
- Have you been afected?
- Yes, but only slightly.

30:12.379 --> 30:15.716
Try to hold on. Archer out.

30:16.342 --> 30:19.512
Get to the bridge.
I want a weather report.

30:30.731 --> 30:32.358
Travis.

30:33.233 --> 30:34.985
You still with me?

30:35.235 --> 30:39.990
I need you on your feet. Those things
could come back at any time.

30:40.699 --> 30:41.784
Listen to me.

30:42.493 --> 30:44.203
I'm giving you an order.

30:46.455 --> 30:48.290
What's wrong?

30:49.082 --> 30:50.918
Ensign?

30:52.836 --> 30:54.880
What'd you do to him?

30:58.508 --> 31:00.177
I see why you get along
so well with them,

31:00.719 --> 31:02.262
sneaking around in the shadows.

31:02.471 --> 31:04.640
That's second nature
to you Vulcans, isn't it?

31:06.934 --> 31:10.604
I have no idea what you just said,
but it didn't sound very nice.

31:12.189 --> 31:14.524
You're making a mistake
working with her.

31:14.733 --> 31:18.445
She'll stab you in the back
first chance she gets.

31:21.490 --> 31:23.325
Tell you what.

31:24.201 --> 31:28.330
Come out,
and we'll settle this peacefully.

31:28.997 --> 31:31.666
Whatever she told you
about humans...

31:32.083 --> 31:35.670
...it's not true.
You can see for yourself.

31:36.630 --> 31:37.797
Say something!

31:48.099 --> 31:49.809
What are you doing here?

31:52.479 --> 31:53.897
Yes, sir.

31:55.523 --> 31:57.567
I know, I know.

31:58.026 --> 32:00.945
But they're not giving me much choice.
I gotta protect my crew.

32:02.989 --> 32:05.241
I understand, Mr Velik,

32:05.450 --> 32:08.077
but I can't do that.
They're trying to kill us.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.123
Nice try.

32:18.546 --> 32:20.548
The centre of the storm's
already passed over them,

32:20.757 --> 32:23.009
but the system spans
some 500 kilometres.

32:23.259 --> 32:25.303
We won't be able to land
a shuttlepod before dawn.

32:25.553 --> 32:27.513
- When's that?
- Nine hours.

32:27.764 --> 32:29.849
- Phlox to Captain Archer.
- Go ahead.

32:30.099 --> 32:33.519
Please report to Sickbay
immediately. It's urgent.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.400
I thought you said
he was gonna be fine.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.362
I did.

32:43.863 --> 32:47.575
But each tropolisine atom
contains a stray neutron.

32:47.783 --> 32:49.744
When it started to break down
in his bloodstream,

32:49.952 --> 32:52.830
it released an undetectable toxin.

32:53.039 --> 32:55.791
I've injected him with Inoprovalene...

32:56.042 --> 32:58.294
...but I think it may be too late.

32:59.420 --> 33:02.506
If I'd run a submolecular scan, I might
have anticipated the complication,

33:02.715 --> 33:04.967
but there was no reason to.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.888
At least, there didn't seem to be.

33:10.806 --> 33:13.893
I can't tell you how sorry
I am, captain.

33:14.727 --> 33:16.771
What about the others?

33:17.354 --> 33:18.522
They spent less time exposed...

33:18.731 --> 33:21.942
I've got four people
down on the surface, doctor.

33:23.486 --> 33:26.780
I need to know if they're gonna be dead
when we get there in the morning.

33:47.468 --> 33:49.178
Stay awake, Travis.

33:49.428 --> 33:52.181
I can't afford to have you
going out on me.

33:52.389 --> 33:57.936
- I'm trying, sir.
- Cutler? You okay?

34:00.689 --> 34:03.901
If you're waiting for me to pass out,
you're wasting your time.

34:04.151 --> 34:06.111
You might as well have
your friends come out now,

34:06.320 --> 34:07.863
do whatever they're gonna do.

34:11.366 --> 34:13.076
- T'Pol.
- How are you doing?

34:13.327 --> 34:15.245
- Who's that?
- It's the captain, Trip.

34:15.454 --> 34:18.373
- Are you all right?
- He's irrational, sir.

34:18.581 --> 34:20.917
Mayweather and Cutler
are nearly unconscious.

34:21.126 --> 34:23.587
Both of you listen to me
very carefully.

34:23.837 --> 34:25.714
Novakovich may be dying.

34:25.964 --> 34:27.882
Turns out the pollen contains
some kind of toxin

34:28.091 --> 34:30.510
our sensors hadn't detected.

34:31.011 --> 34:34.097
He's responding to medication,
but his odds of recovery

34:34.306 --> 34:37.893
would be a hell of a lot better
if we'd treated him sooner.

34:38.976 --> 34:41.021
The doctor and Malcolm
are synthesizing

34:41.228 --> 34:43.315
ampoules of Inoprovalene.

34:43.565 --> 34:45.859
We're gonna have to use
the transporter to get it to you,

34:46.067 --> 34:49.987
but it's imperative that you inoculate
yourselves as soon as possible.

34:50.237 --> 34:52.157
Do you understand what I'm saying?

34:52.407 --> 34:54.451
Taking an injection
isn't gonna change a damn thing.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.995
Don't you see that?
They're planning something, captain.

34:57.203 --> 34:58.913
First us, then all of you.

35:06.379 --> 35:07.630
What's going on, Hoshi?

35:07.839 --> 35:10.550
She says Trip's going to kill her.
I don't think she's imagining it.

35:10.925 --> 35:13.887
Say one more word of that gibberish,
and I'm gonna split you in two.

35:14.137 --> 35:18.474
Trip, listen to me.
The pollen's affecting her too.

35:18.808 --> 35:20.518
Think about it.

35:21.019 --> 35:23.688
You've heard of people
suffering from dementia

35:23.897 --> 35:26.858
who revert to their native language.
She can't help it.

35:27.066 --> 35:29.360
The only thing that's affecting her
are those rock people.

35:29.611 --> 35:31.904
If I can stop her now,
I can save Enterprise.

35:32.113 --> 35:34.365
Trip, how long have we
known each other?

35:34.615 --> 35:36.451
What's that got to do with anything?

35:36.701 --> 35:40.038
Remember when your
EV pack froze up on Titan?

35:40.288 --> 35:44.625
During the Omega training mission?
You got nitrogen narcosis.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.044
You started to try to take off
your helmet.

35:47.253 --> 35:48.880
You remember what I'm talking about?

35:49.130 --> 35:50.173
What's your point?

35:50.381 --> 35:52.925
I ordered you
to keep your helmet on.

35:53.176 --> 35:55.011
You were delirious,
thought you were gonna die.

35:55.219 --> 35:57.680
But you obeyed that order
because you trusted me.

35:58.097 --> 36:01.809
I'm asking you to trust me now.

36:02.059 --> 36:04.103
Take the injection.

36:04.520 --> 36:08.065
Then we'll deal
with these rock people.

36:16.657 --> 36:18.284
Too late, captain.

36:19.201 --> 36:21.328
I'm not gonna die
with a hypospray in my hand.

36:21.537 --> 36:24.206
- Trip...
- No! It's not gonna happen.

36:24.415 --> 36:26.876
All right. Forget the medicine.

36:28.419 --> 36:33.591
I think it's time I explain
what's really going on.

36:34.633 --> 36:38.971
But just stand by for a minute.
I need Malcolm to target your position.

36:39.221 --> 36:41.557
Then I'll give you your orders.

36:46.770 --> 36:47.771
Archer to Phlox.

36:47.980 --> 36:51.316
- The sooner the better.
- Understood.

36:51.525 --> 36:52.735
How close can you get it?

36:52.943 --> 36:55.738
I think I can safely place it two metres
inside the mouth of the cave.

36:55.946 --> 36:57.448
Good.

37:01.452 --> 37:03.287
Captain?

37:03.495 --> 37:04.872
Hello?

37:05.581 --> 37:08.876
I'm waiting for that order,
but I can't wait much longer.

37:11.044 --> 37:12.880
All right, Trip.

37:13.130 --> 37:18.302
This is a major breach of security,
but I'm going to have to trust you.

37:18.552 --> 37:19.553
Go ahead.

37:19.803 --> 37:24.975
Starfleet sent us here to make
contact with a silicon-based life form.

37:25.183 --> 37:29.021
T'Pol was the only person granted
clearance to speak with them.

37:29.271 --> 37:32.899
- Seems they've met Vulcans before.
- Why couldn't you tell me that?

37:33.150 --> 37:35.819
When a mission's classified
top-secret, I don't ask why.

37:36.069 --> 37:40.198
If it was so top-secret, then why'd you
let us all come down to the surface?

37:40.407 --> 37:44.119
- Let us spend the night?
- The winds.

37:45.078 --> 37:48.164
We never thought the storm
would drive you into the caves.

37:48.415 --> 37:51.293
That's where these rock people live.

37:51.626 --> 37:54.421
They didn't want anybody in there
except for T'Pol,

37:54.629 --> 37:58.550
so they're not too happy right now.
I'm sure you can understand that.

37:59.134 --> 38:01.886
They've even threatened
to destroy Enterprise.

38:02.095 --> 38:06.933
Now, T'Pol needs to explain to them
why you're all there,

38:07.183 --> 38:08.893
but she's not gonna have
much credibility

38:09.102 --> 38:11.563
with you pointing
a phase pistol at her.

38:11.813 --> 38:16.359
If they agree to listen to her,
you'll need to lower your weapon.

38:16.609 --> 38:18.486
If they don't...

38:19.028 --> 38:22.740
...l'm gonna have Malcolm
destroy the cavern.

38:22.991 --> 38:28.079
Sacrificing four more crewmen is
a small price to pay to save Enterprise.

38:28.288 --> 38:30.331
I understand.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.166
Now...

38:32.917 --> 38:37.880
...l'm gonna ask Hoshi to tell T'Pol
everything I just told you in Vulcan.

38:38.131 --> 38:40.591
You got a problem with that?

38:40.842 --> 38:42.552
Go ahead.

38:42.802 --> 38:44.637
Ensign.

39:02.864 --> 39:08.703
She says play-acting isn't exactly a
Vulcan tradition, but she'll do her best.

39:35.771 --> 39:38.858
Hope she knows the difference
between stun and kill.

39:44.154 --> 39:47.241
They've agreed to talk to her, Trip.

39:48.158 --> 39:51.917
So lower your weapon,
and act real friendly.

40:30.409 --> 40:31.868
No.

41:18.206 --> 41:20.333
You didn't shoot me last night,
did you?

41:21.042 --> 41:22.669
I'm afraid I did.

41:23.545 --> 41:26.881
I was hoping it was all
just a bad dream.

41:28.216 --> 41:30.051
Are they gone?

41:30.343 --> 41:32.470
They were never here.

41:33.054 --> 41:35.515
- What?
- There were no rock people.

41:35.723 --> 41:37.433
You were all hallucinating.

41:39.143 --> 41:41.813
- The pollen?
- Yes.

41:42.063 --> 41:45.441
Then what about that speech
you gave to the wall?

41:45.692 --> 41:48.361
The captain felt
that if I played along,

41:48.569 --> 41:50.863
it might help persuade you
to lower your weapon.

41:51.406 --> 41:54.951
You'd grown increasingly illogical
and violent.

41:55.201 --> 41:58.412
Something about
"splitting me in two."

42:00.540 --> 42:03.000
A pretty good performance.

42:04.961 --> 42:08.881
Look, I know I kind of
shot my mouth off last night.

42:09.173 --> 42:13.302
You were under the influence
of the pollen. We all were.

42:14.428 --> 42:18.557
"Challenge your preconceptions
or they'll challenge you."

42:18.766 --> 42:20.601
Commander?

42:21.018 --> 42:23.896
That's something
Mr Velik used to say.

42:24.563 --> 42:27.108
Tenth-grade biology class.

42:27.316 --> 42:32.321
He was a Vulcan scientist who came
to teach us about life on other worlds.

42:32.571 --> 42:37.118
I'd never seen a Vulcan before,
not up close.

42:39.703 --> 42:41.330
He scared the hell out of me.

42:41.872 --> 42:44.875
Perhaps it's not too late
to follow his advice.

42:49.421 --> 42:52.716
I must have twisted up my neck.

42:53.592 --> 42:56.470
How's Novakovich? Do we know?

42:56.720 --> 42:59.056
The captain says
he's going to be fine.
