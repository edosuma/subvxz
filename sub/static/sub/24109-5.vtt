00:01.200 --> 00:02.000
PREVIOUSLY

00:02.200 --> 00:07.560
I will be honest with you and you will be
honest with me. Thomas Spectre is my son.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.800
We have to work together.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.240
Post for you.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.720
Their lies are so powerful
that eyes become blind.

00:17.920 --> 00:21.080
You can speak into it
and record voice memos.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.240
Yes, OK. We get it.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.840
They found you in the woods, Mie. Your arm
was injured and you were covered in blood.

00:30.520 --> 00:31.920
Bob.

00:32.120 --> 00:35.760
She started acting up after we moved.
There's something bad about that place.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.240
Naughty Mummy!

00:39.440 --> 00:42.880
There is more out there than we can see.
- And you believe in all of that?

00:43.080 --> 00:46.200
The most important thing is that
it helps people, eh?

00:46.400 --> 00:50.480
Are you going to wreck your brain
completely with this hocus-pocus bullshit?

00:50.680 --> 00:53.920
Things aren't going too well.
He's away a lot, for work.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.680
Could you take over?
Thanks, Viviane.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.880
Weekend in Paris.
Say you have to go to a conference.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.560
I'm going to bed.

02:13.680 --> 02:20.680
<i>Memory
All alone in the moonlight</i>

02:20.880 --> 02:25.040
<i>I can smile like the old days</i>

02:25.240 --> 02:28.640
<i>I was beautiful then</i>

02:30.240 --> 02:33.920
<i>I remember the time</i>

02:34.120 --> 02:37.560
<i>I knew what happiness was</i>

02:38.160 --> 02:44.960
<i>Let the memory live again</i>

02:45.600 --> 02:47.480
<i>Sunlight...</i>

02:47.680 --> 02:50.560
<i>You were much better, honeybird.
Much better.</i>

02:50.760 --> 02:54.280
<i>... trees in summer</i>

02:54.480 --> 03:01.080
<i>Endless masquerade</i>

03:03.360 --> 03:06.520
<i>Like a flower</i>

03:06.720 --> 03:10.840
<i>As the dawn is breaking</i>

03:11.040 --> 03:19.320
<i>The memory is fading</i>

03:19.520 --> 03:26.400
<i>Moonlight
Turn your face to the moonlight</i>

03:26.600 --> 03:30.520
<i>Let your memory lead you</i>

03:30.720 --> 03:34.200
<i>Open up, let her in</i>

03:35.920 --> 03:42.880
<i>If you find there
The meaning of what happiness is</i>

03:43.440 --> 03:50.400
<i>Then a new life will begin</i>

03:54.680 --> 03:58.400
<i>Mie? Mie? Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, Chantal.</i>

03:58.600 --> 04:03.600
Hi. What did you think?
- How are you? How's things?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.800
Fine.
- Sorry, Benoit. Chantal.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.080
Hi.
- She does costumes.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.080
Oh, you did the costumes?
- For this? No, no, no, no.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.160
No, I'm just a tourist this evening.
- Oh, OK.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.240
It's nice to see you again.
- You too.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.120
You're looking good.
- Thank you.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.880
Honestly. It's nice to see.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.520
We'll have to do this more often, eh?

04:30.160 --> 04:35.280
Hmm?
- Yes. Yeah, yeah. Uh... Definitely.

04:38.120 --> 04:42.120
Oh, the director. I'll be right back.
- OK. Bye-bye.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.880
Are you OK?
- Hmm.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.360
Shouldn't we think about going?
The babysitter has an exam tomorrow.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.120
Oh, yes, of course. Of course.
- OK.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.840
Hi.
- Hello.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.640
Hi.
- Hi.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.360
Sorry, I'll...
- No, Valerie, leave it. We'll do it.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.800
And? Did everything go OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.080
She went to bed without a problem?
- Yes.

05:39.240 --> 05:46.120
What do we owe you?
- From 7 till now. That's 30, please.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.360
Oh, have you got a 10 euro note?
- No, I gave it to you for the car park.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.000
Is it OK if we settle up next time?
- Yeah, yeah. No problem.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.960
Shall I take you home?
- I'm on my bicycle.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.280
I can put it in the car.
- Oh, no, no, that's not necessary.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.720
You're sure?
- Yeah. Enjoy the rest of your evening.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.520
Yeah. Bye.
- It's really sweet of you but...

06:22.880 --> 06:25.360
I'm glad we had a night out again.
Aren't you?

06:25.560 --> 06:26.960
Definitely.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.960
Do you think she's pretty?

06:39.800 --> 06:42.040
Valerie?
- Mmm hmm.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.200
The babysitter?
- Yes.

06:45.160 --> 06:49.200
I'm old enough to be her father.
- If she were a bit older.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.160
Then I wouldn't kick her out of my bed.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.560
Don't be so serious.

06:59.640 --> 07:04.080
There's a bottle open. Want some?
- Sure.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.080
Toot toot.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.160
Look, smiling eggs.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.640
Enjoy your breakfast.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.560
Go on, eat.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.320
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.880
Eat nicely.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.960
Sorry, I just had to do something.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.960
Why don't you ever say anything?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.720
I always have to be the bad guy.
You never say a word.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.160
Mie, don't...
We'll talk about it this evening, OK?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.880
Shall we do something nice this weekend?
- Yes.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.240
Go to the zoo maybe?
- Yes. See the hyenas.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.680
See the hyenas?

08:17.240 --> 08:19.520
I have to, uh... work all weekend.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.320
Sorry.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.160
Disappointed?

08:39.440 --> 08:41.320
Why have you started smoking again?

09:12.680 --> 09:15.960
Mummy, where is Daddy?
- He's gone to work.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.440
Can I help?
- The knives are much too sharp.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.680
Valerie lets me.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.080
Valerie?
- The babysitter.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.680
Don't do that.

09:36.440 --> 09:40.520
Is Valerie nice?
- Yes, Valerie is like a princess.

09:43.400 --> 09:47.400
Does Daddy think so too?
- Yes, but I always say you're prettier.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.880
Why are you crying?

09:58.040 --> 10:01.680
I'm not crying. It's just the onions.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.360
Come on, let Mummy get on.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.000
Put that back.
- I'm hungry.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.320
It's lunch soon. Put it back.

10:16.720 --> 10:20.680
I'm hungry now.
- You can have a carrot.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.400
I want chocolate mousse.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.880
If you eat all your lunch,
you can have some afterwards. Put it back.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.160
I want chocolate mousse now.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.840
Stop it or I'll put you outside.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.080
Does it hurt?

11:16.640 --> 11:17.920
Romy.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.760
Stop it. Come on. Go to bed.

11:26.120 --> 11:32.280
Romy? Come on. You're tired.
It's school tomorrow. Go to bed.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.560
Don't lock the door, Mummy.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.280
Mummy, don't.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.640
Benoit D'Haeze is unavailable
at the moment...

12:35.840 --> 12:38.880
Hello.
- You called.

12:39.080 --> 12:44.880
Yes. Where are you?
- Where do you think I am, honeybird?

12:46.920 --> 12:52.520
Still at work?
- Yes. I'm... I'm almost finished here.

12:54.840 --> 13:00.200
Benoit, I don't like being here alone.
- I've almost finished here. Uh...

13:00.400 --> 13:03.360
I'm on my way. Go to sleep.
- Hmm.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.440
See you in a minute.
- Benoit.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.040
Yes?
- Am I a good mother?

13:16.360 --> 13:21.520
Honeybird, you're the best mother
I could ever imagine.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.280
Go to sleep now. I'm on my way. OK?

13:31.400 --> 13:32.800
See you in a minute.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.600
Benoit!

15:35.680 --> 15:37.920
Shhh, shhh, Mie. Shhh.

15:47.120 --> 15:51.440
How long have you been here?
- A while, Mie. A while.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.680
Shhh.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.880
Was Romy here?
- Shhh, no, Mie. Romy isn't here.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.520
Go to sleep. Get some sleep.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.200
Go to sleep. Sleep tight.

16:21.080 --> 16:27.000
TODAY - 9 DECEMBER
Does the hospital know?
- Yes. They've arranged a room for us.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.640
Does the patient have
any experience of this?

16:29.840 --> 16:34.560
No idea, but I'm open to
anything today, Carlo.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.560
That sounds rather desperate.

16:38.560 --> 16:44.200
Listen to my voice. Only to my voice.

16:45.240 --> 16:51.040
You're lying on the beach.
It's lovely and warm.

16:51.240 --> 16:55.400
And you're slipping gently down
into the wonderful, deep sand.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.640
Your body is heavy.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.960
Very heavy.

17:03.040 --> 17:09.920
And you slip further and further down
into that wonderful soft sand.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.680
Are you on a beach?

17:19.600 --> 17:20.920
No.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.640
Where are you?

17:24.760 --> 17:26.560
In some woods.

17:28.120 --> 17:32.160
In the garden.
- What can you see?

17:34.960 --> 17:38.080
Grandpa and Grandma's house.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.480
A tree.

17:42.720 --> 17:46.320
A walnut tree.
- Go and sit quietly by the tree.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.080
I can't.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.120
I have to go and see.

17:53.320 --> 17:58.960
Have to go and see what?
- I have to go and see if he's OK.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.320
I have to go and see if he's OK.

18:05.360 --> 18:10.400
They've taken him.
- Him? Who is him?

18:10.600 --> 18:14.760
Him.
- What have they done to him?

18:17.360 --> 18:18.640
It hurts.

18:18.840 --> 18:22.120
Blood. I've got blood on my arm.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.480
I'm scared of him.
- Who is him, Mie?

18:32.160 --> 18:34.120
He hurt me.

18:37.600 --> 18:44.480
They are going to... No. They've tied
him up. They want to kill him.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.880
Who are they going to kill? Thomas?

18:47.080 --> 18:52.040
Don't. It doesn't hurt anymore, Grandpa.
You mustn't kill him.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.320
You mustn't kill Pino.
- Wake... Wake her up.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.880
Calm down, Mie. Calm down.

18:59.080 --> 19:03.560
I'm going to count from one to three. Then
you will come back to the here and now.

19:03.960 --> 19:09.000
One, two and now three...

19:10.560 --> 19:15.560
Mie. We just hypnotized you to find out
more about Thomas Spectre,

19:15.760 --> 19:18.560
but who is Pino?

19:19.560 --> 19:24.000
They put Pino down because he bit me.
Pino is...

19:24.200 --> 19:25.480
A dog.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.200
Yeah, right, childhood traumas...

19:36.920 --> 19:38.760
He's got glasses?

19:41.400 --> 19:42.720
Glasses?

19:43.920 --> 19:45.320
Phhh...

19:47.040 --> 19:52.080
Glasses. Are those glasses? Hmm...
- Yes.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.720
Has he got a moustache?

19:57.920 --> 19:58.960
No.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.080
Wolkers came to see me with a hypnotist.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.400
You didn't let anyone into your head,
did you, Mie?

20:06.120 --> 20:07.960
I promised to cooperate.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.440
Psst. You have to be wary of
three kinds of people.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.960
Police, psychiatrists and hypnotists.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.880
Pyromaniacs maybe too but they're nothing
compared with the other three.

20:22.080 --> 20:26.960
Don't worry. I won't let them look inside
my head unless I know what's in there.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.240
Is he bald?

20:34.480 --> 20:37.320
Yes. Is it Claire?
- No.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.680
I pretended.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.240
Mie has been naughty.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.400
Is it Suzan?
- It's my turn.

20:56.080 --> 21:00.840
Wolkers is Thomas Spectre's father.
- How do you know?

21:01.040 --> 21:06.160
He told me. I feel sorry for him.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.840
His child is missing.
But I don't trust him.

21:13.760 --> 21:17.200
Has he got blue eyes?
- Yes.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.800
Is it Suzan?
- No, it's not Suzan.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.920
Is it Bob?
- Yes, it's Bob.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.400
Goddammit.

21:31.480 --> 21:36.040
Bob.
- Who you always dream about. Bob.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.840
Hey, Mie, those woods...

21:46.720 --> 21:50.120
That's where they found you
after your black-out, isn't it?

21:50.320 --> 21:51.760
Mmm hmm.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.840
How old is your daughter?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.640
Seven.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.240
Is she colour-blind?
- Hey.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.320
What? I'd send her to art classes,
if I were you.

22:06.520 --> 22:09.840
Those colours aren't right,
not for a child of seven.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.960
What do you know about that?

22:14.040 --> 22:16.000
Check it out.

22:19.960 --> 22:23.240
Well?
- Well what?

22:23.440 --> 22:26.720
You know the rules well enough.
Not in each other's room. Come on.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.280
Shoot me.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.280
Come on.

22:40.160 --> 22:45.240
Mie, rise and rise again until lambs
become lions. Robin Hood.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.840
Come on. Have you finished?
- Yes.

22:59.360 --> 23:03.480
2 MONTHS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

23:22.400 --> 23:26.120
Weekend in Paris.
Say you have to go to a conference.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.920
Kisses, V.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.600
Romy.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.760
Romy.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.400
Romy.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.840
Romy.

24:02.760 --> 24:06.440
Catch me if you can.
You can't catch me.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.360
Romy?

24:08.560 --> 24:11.840
Catch me if you can.
You can't catch me.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.680
Romy?

24:19.000 --> 24:22.600
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
- Romy?

24:28.480 --> 24:29.800
Romy.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.400
Romy?

24:43.760 --> 24:48.520
Romy? Stop playing now, that's enough.
Get out from under there. It's dirty.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.760
Look what I found.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.040
Move out of the way.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.120
Look, Mummy.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.440
What's this...?

25:16.480 --> 25:19.320
Mummy, this is our secret camp.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.000
Watch out.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.120
Yoo-hoo.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.600
Hi.

25:49.760 --> 25:53.720
I told you you could start.
- Yes, but I wasn't hungry.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.400
Neither was your daughter.
She's in bed already.

26:11.960 --> 26:15.360
You may have to reheat it.
- No.

26:26.680 --> 26:27.920
Who is V?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.120
V?

26:32.680 --> 26:37.000
Oh, that. That's, uh...

26:37.200 --> 26:40.480
Viviane from work.
Executive secretary.

26:44.840 --> 26:48.080
Your executive secretary
wants to go to Paris with you?

26:49.400 --> 26:55.440
It was a birthday present from
all my colleagues for the two of us.

27:00.400 --> 27:05.680
Say you have to go to a conference.
Happy birthday. Kiss, kiss, kiss, V.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.360
That's their sense of humour.

27:15.640 --> 27:20.080
Mie, Viviane is 59.
She has menopause written all over her.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.120
Hey?

27:28.120 --> 27:31.080
You're the only honeybird in my garden.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.160
OK?

27:46.440 --> 27:52.600
V. Who is V?
Is it Viviane, his secretary?

27:54.520 --> 27:56.040
I don't believe him.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.800
Mie?
- Yes?

28:02.000 --> 28:05.240
What are you doing?
- Having a poo.

28:05.440 --> 28:06.960
Oh.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.040
May I?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.680
He's lying.
<i>He's lying.</i>

28:20.560 --> 28:24.000
<i>TODAY
9 DECEMBER</i>

29:02.160 --> 29:03.200
Have you got a second?

29:05.720 --> 29:07.120
Yes.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.680
I've...
- Sorry. Your second is over.

29:22.760 --> 29:27.080
I've seen you're quite good friends
with Mie D'Haeze.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.040
Do you have a lot to say to each other?

29:33.480 --> 29:34.760
Yum.

29:36.040 --> 29:39.200
Best crème brûlée there is.
- No thanks.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.840
Apparently the one in the open wing
is much better.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.720
Maybe I can arrange something.

29:51.360 --> 29:56.440
Because I'm so good-looking?
- For information about your friend.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.360
Information?

30:02.920 --> 30:04.760
I don't know...

30:05.840 --> 30:11.600
Maybe she remembers things
she doesn't dare tell me.

30:11.800 --> 30:16.440
Like what's in her sketchbook,
for example.

30:20.640 --> 30:25.040
They torture us with
craft and drawing therapy here.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.880
Don't read more into that book than that.

30:32.120 --> 30:35.760
Mie is the sheep here, not the wolf.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.480
Even more reason to help her then, eh?

30:52.120 --> 30:55.720
I'm not interested in open wings.

30:56.960 --> 30:58.920
Airplane wings, on the other hand...

31:03.960 --> 31:07.800
I may have a white beard
but I'm not Father Christmas.

31:10.840 --> 31:12.880
I thought your son was worth more.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.640
Aren't you a bit too close
to the investigation?

31:24.480 --> 31:27.480
I haven't got time for games,
you crazy fool.

31:29.040 --> 31:33.040
Only fools tell the truth.

31:43.240 --> 31:48.920
Right. Um... Today I would like us
to first think carefully

31:49.120 --> 31:54.880
about how we feel. OK?

31:55.840 --> 31:59.120
And... then we are going to try

31:59.320 --> 32:04.120
to express that feeling
in the form of...

32:06.320 --> 32:09.520
an animal. For ex.ample...
- You're late.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.360
I hate crafts.
- I feel lonely.

32:12.880 --> 32:16.160
Which animal could we express that with?
- A giraffe.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.800
What?
- A giraffe.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.200
Well... Well, yeah, there you are.
A giraffe. See?

32:22.400 --> 32:25.960
Or I'm... I'm tired. I feel drained. Uh...

32:26.160 --> 32:29.240
I don't feel like... getting up.
- A sloth.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.480
Yes.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.760
Here, our pet monkey is on the ball.
Give him a monkey nut.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.760
Right, come on. Get started.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.320
I received a letter.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.840
For example, up high,
imprisoned in an ivory tower.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.320
Someone wants to help you.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.280
Judging by the writing,
I'd say a doctor.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.400
Or a Parkinson sufferer.
- Hmm.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.920
Or a red-hot admirer.

33:02.120 --> 33:05.280
Come on, guys, let's get started.

33:08.880 --> 33:12.800
Have you got an animal already?
- Um, I thought about a...

33:14.360 --> 33:17.640
About a fish in a jar.
- A fish. OK.

33:17.840 --> 33:23.000
Or, no, no. No, no.
A, uh... birdie in a cage.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.320
A bird? OK.
Start your bird then.

33:53.680 --> 33:56.880
Jan, uh...
- Vronsky.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.600
Vronsky, sorry.
Which animal have you chosen?

34:01.920 --> 34:05.920
Can't you see what it is? A firefly.
- OK.

34:07.080 --> 34:11.600
I emit light in the dark.
And no one sees me during the day...

34:22.280 --> 34:23.320
Boo!

34:23.520 --> 34:26.160
You naughty ghost!
Look what you've done.

34:26.360 --> 34:30.640
2 MONTHS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

34:30.840 --> 34:32.560
You look sexy.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.440
Where is your costume?
- Eh?

34:37.360 --> 34:39.440
Your costume.
- Um, here.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.320
Your mask.
- Yeah...

34:41.520 --> 34:43.840
Your hat.
- I'm wearing black. It'll be fine.

34:44.360 --> 34:47.600
Where is your sword?
- Here is my sword.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.560
Mummy, can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

34:50.760 --> 34:54.280
Where is Houdini?
- Houdini? Who is Houdini?

34:54.480 --> 34:58.120
Our cat with three legs.
- I don't know, sweetie.

34:58.320 --> 35:02.200
It's your fault. You didn't feed her.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.520
<i>Caramba, señorita.</i>

35:10.280 --> 35:11.440
<i>You look great.
- Do I?</i>

35:11.640 --> 35:14.680
Oh. Hold on, hold on.
- No, no, no. I've got a moustache.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.480
Phhh.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.680
OK?
- Yes.

35:24.880 --> 35:27.080
Who is it?
- Uh, the office.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.400
Oh, there they are.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.760
Happy Halloween.

35:52.800 --> 35:56.600
Daddy is Shrek.
- Shrek? Daddy is the Hulk. Remember?

35:56.800 --> 35:59.680
Daddy is the Hulk and
he's going to kill you all.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.800
Go and play, boys.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.920
Hey, can I have a go?

36:09.880 --> 36:15.160
Is that a real stomach or...
- It's in solidarity with Nikki.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.720
Delicious, Rita. Honestly.
- Yes.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.960
Wow, Rita.
Your chilli con carne, amazing.

36:22.160 --> 36:25.040
I'm not responsible for
the consequences later.

36:25.240 --> 36:28.120
Daddy, can you wipe my bottom?

36:28.800 --> 36:30.680
Aren't you big enough to do it yourself?

36:30.880 --> 36:34.200
The toilet paper is all gone, Daddy.
- Come on, Daddy.

36:34.840 --> 36:35.840
Jules?

36:37.360 --> 36:39.040
Your brother needs you.

36:44.320 --> 36:46.320
I think Benoit is seeing someone.

36:47.560 --> 36:48.800
Where did that come from?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.360
I don't know.

36:54.080 --> 36:57.840
Things haven't been going too well lately.
- Yes, you told me.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.560
Do you think Benoit would cheat on me?

37:01.800 --> 37:04.120
If it were Ollie I'd know straight away.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.040
Would you?
- Yes, he can't lie.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.720
Benoit loves you but he is more...

37:11.920 --> 37:14.440
Do you know I've never seen him cry?

37:18.320 --> 37:22.840
Maybe you have but you don't remember.

37:26.880 --> 37:30.480
Hey, mine cries over a Stallone film.
Is that better?

37:38.240 --> 37:39.920
I sometimes feel so alone.

37:43.320 --> 37:46.560
Forgetting stuff isn't so bad. You...
You learn to live with it.

37:46.760 --> 37:51.560
But I'm always left with a sort of feeling
that I can't place.

37:55.680 --> 37:59.440
Then I start having doubts.
About myself.

37:59.640 --> 38:03.160
About everything. About Benoit.

38:03.360 --> 38:07.280
But I suppose
that's just in my head too, eh?

38:08.560 --> 38:11.680
Hey? Are you crying?
- No.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.640
Hey.

38:13.840 --> 38:16.560
What you've just said and
your situation...

38:16.760 --> 38:18.960
You don't have to cry about that.
- Oh.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.880
Hey.

38:21.720 --> 38:24.960
What are you two
whispering about over there? Eh?

38:29.880 --> 38:33.400
Now what? Did I say something wrong again?
- No.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.600
Oh.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.640
Hey. Watch out.

38:40.520 --> 38:45.720
Hey, Walter, don't monopolize Mozes
too much, eh? I'm the one who pays him.

38:45.920 --> 38:50.080
No, Dad's pension pays him.
- Well said, Mie-Mie.

38:50.280 --> 38:53.640
"You say potatoes, I say potatoes."
Honestly.

38:53.840 --> 38:58.920
But I must say things have been going
really well here lately. Fantastic.

38:59.120 --> 39:03.720
Dad and I had sex again this weekend.

39:06.320 --> 39:11.880
He's no longer a young stallion
but it did us good, eh, Casanova?

39:12.080 --> 39:13.560
It did, eh?

39:17.680 --> 39:21.600
What? You are all adults.
What's the problem?

39:21.800 --> 39:26.440
Happy Halloween.
- Ohhh, bravo!

39:26.640 --> 39:28.080
Happy Halloween.

39:28.440 --> 39:31.120
I spent all afternoon on that.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.800
Yeah, there was a long queue
at the baker's.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.080
Thought so.

39:41.960 --> 39:42.920
What's the matter?

39:45.160 --> 39:51.440
What's the matter, darling?
Didn't you want chocolate?

39:51.960 --> 39:54.360
What's the matter with Grandpa?
- Shhh.

40:02.200 --> 40:07.280
It's All Saints' Day.
- No. It's Halloween, Walter. Halloween.

40:07.480 --> 40:11.800
It's All Saints' Day tomorrow.
- It's not a carnival.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.680
We have to remember the dead.

40:18.440 --> 40:21.200
Don't we, Romy?

40:21.480 --> 40:26.800
Come on. I've worked hard all day
to make sure it'd be fun.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.160
Sit up straight. Sit up straight, I said.
- Mum.

40:29.360 --> 40:34.960
What? What? Not right again? No?
Am I the bad guy again? Am I?

40:35.160 --> 40:38.880
OK, fine.
I am Cruella De Vil, after all.

40:39.920 --> 40:43.160
Dad. Careful, careful.

40:44.720 --> 40:45.760
Hey.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.200
What are you doing?

41:51.840 --> 41:54.200
I told you I had to go to work.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.080
Today is a public holiday.

41:58.840 --> 42:02.040
There's not much to do on
All Saints' Day, is there, Mie?

42:02.240 --> 42:05.880
I won't be late.
- You've forgotten your briefcase.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.080
Maybe you can say goodbye
to your daughter...?

42:27.240 --> 42:29.480
Mummy, why are you crying?

42:29.680 --> 42:34.920
Mummy is just a bit sad.
- Is it because Daddy is gone again?

42:36.880 --> 42:38.000
Yes.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.960
Shall we go and look for him?

42:47.200 --> 42:50.880
I think Daddy has a hiding place.

42:58.240 --> 42:59.720
Come on.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.600
Come on.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.560
Put your belt on, sweetie.

43:52.840 --> 43:53.800
Fuck.

44:37.640 --> 44:42.400
Mummy, this isn't Daddy's hiding place.
This is Daddy's work.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.480
I know, sweetie,
but we'll just wait here a while.

44:58.040 --> 45:01.800
Mummy? Do we have to wait here
much longer?

45:03.160 --> 45:08.240
Do we have to wait here much longer?
- No, my little angel. Just a bit longer.

45:19.640 --> 45:23.160
Can I play a game on your phone?

45:27.880 --> 45:31.360
Oh, shit.
- Mummy, you mustn't say that.

45:32.240 --> 45:36.800
Sorry. Daddy knows where we are. Shit.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.080
Let Mummy think for a moment.

45:40.640 --> 45:42.360
Nikki. Nikki. Nikki.

45:50.800 --> 45:52.280
Come on.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.520
Hi, it's Nikki. Message after...

46:05.640 --> 46:07.960
Annemie? If it's about yesterday,
now isn't...

46:08.160 --> 46:13.880
No, Mum, I wanted to ask something.
Could you have Romy for an hour or so?

46:14.080 --> 46:17.080
Now? I've got clearing up to do
and I've a splitting headache.

46:17.280 --> 46:22.120
It's really urgent.
- Annemie, please, I... Honestly.

46:22.320 --> 46:25.960
Mum. Mum, if... Listen. It's...
- It's what?

46:26.680 --> 46:28.560
Really important
or I wouldn't ask.

46:28.760 --> 46:31.160
My hangover is important too.

46:31.360 --> 46:36.360
Mum, I'm... I'm in the car park
at Benoit's work. Come here. OK?

46:36.560 --> 46:38.000
What are you doing there?

46:38.200 --> 46:43.080
Mum, don't ask questions.
Just come here, OK?

46:43.280 --> 46:49.040
OK, give me a moment to get dressed.
- OK. Thank you. See you in a minute.

46:50.200 --> 46:52.440
A game. Here.

47:00.400 --> 47:04.200
Give it to me. Hey, come here.
It's only for a while, OK?

47:05.000 --> 47:08.160
Phhh. Right then, here I am.
- Come on.

47:08.360 --> 47:11.760
Sweetheart, what is so important?
- I'll tell you later.

47:11.960 --> 47:14.640
What?
- I'll tell you later.

47:16.640 --> 47:19.080
Is there anything I can do here maybe?

47:19.280 --> 47:23.400
No, just look after Romy and...
take her things with you.

47:23.600 --> 47:27.880
OK. But listen a moment.
Wouldn't it be better if you...

47:28.080 --> 47:32.000
Mum, I just want to have a chat
with Benoit in peace, OK?

47:33.280 --> 47:34.360
Don't worry.
- OK.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.600
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

47:36.800 --> 47:39.200
And be careful, eh?
- Yeah, yeah.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.160
I knew it.

49:56.480 --> 50:00.520
ROMY D'HAEZE
20 SEPTEMBER x- 12 MÅRCH 2017

50:04.280 --> 50:09.280
Mrs D'Haeze, you've had an accident.
You've suffered a traumatic brain injury.

50:11.560 --> 50:14.720
Romy?
- Your daughter didn't make it.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.640
Romy?

50:18.840 --> 50:21.240
Take it easy, madam.
You've had an accident.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.720
You've suffered a traumatic brain injury.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.960
Where is my daughter?
- I'm sorry.

50:28.880 --> 50:31.920
What am I doing here?
- You've had an accident.

50:32.120 --> 50:34.880
You've suffered a traumatic brain injury.

50:35.080 --> 50:38.200
Hi. And Romy?

51:29.760 --> 51:33.520
NEXT TIME

51:33.720 --> 51:36.000
Why did you lie to me?
- Time and time again

51:36.200 --> 51:39.400
we had to tell you Romy was dead.
And time and time again you forgot.

51:44.600 --> 51:47.920
Maybe Romy is here to help you remember.

51:48.680 --> 51:52.080
The place has fucking monkey nuts
but no alcohol, or what?

51:53.160 --> 51:55.360
Oops.
- Get out or I'll kill you!
