01:55.716 --> 01:57.116
Huh, huh?
- Oh, shit.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.484
- Does this look
below the neck? Huh?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.419
- No it does not.
- No it does not.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.720
Freakin' face shot.

02:01.722 --> 02:02.721
You...20 bucks.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.389
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.891
- Twenty Bucks!
- Absolutely.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.426
- You should have a sip
of the homemade.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.428
- Yeah.
- Twenty bucks.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.730
Yeah, okay, but that--
that was kinda' worth it.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.599
- Oh, wow.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.802
- You know,
people have lost eyes.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.737
- [laughs]
- Oh, kiss my ass.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.839
- Oh, come on, Sunkist!
- Ted, Ted, Ted!

02:20.841 --> 02:22.674
- Look at the bright side.
- Don't run away.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.277
I think we found your color.
Orange looks terrific on you!

02:25.279 --> 02:26.912
You could go to a rave
right now.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.915
[music]

02:35.289 --> 02:38.524
- ¶ Well I can't understand
what is wrong with the man ¶

02:38.526 --> 02:40.325
¶ Don't he know how
he's acting ¶

02:40.327 --> 02:42.227
¶ Was long ago banned ¶

02:42.229 --> 02:43.629
¶ Don't you think it's a shame ¶

02:43.631 --> 02:45.430
¶ Someone tell me his name ¶

02:45.432 --> 02:46.632
¶ If we let him continue ¶

02:46.634 --> 02:51.603
¶ It may get out of hand ¶

02:51.605 --> 02:54.806
¶ Well, look at him laughing
and carrying on ¶

02:54.808 --> 02:58.343
¶ Like a hydrogen manic
or an organic bomb ¶

02:58.345 --> 03:00.279
¶ He's alive like a child ¶

03:00.281 --> 03:01.713
¶ So terribly wild ¶

03:01.715 --> 03:03.348
¶ He has way too much freedom ¶

03:03.350 --> 03:07.920
¶ Of course he is wrong,
he's wrong, yeah ¶

03:07.922 --> 03:11.456
¶ 'Cause he was born on the road
in the month of July ¶

03:11.458 --> 03:14.493
¶ And he'll live on the road
'til he sees fit to die ¶

03:14.495 --> 03:16.195
¶ 'Cause he learned
from the road ¶

03:16.197 --> 03:17.796
¶ How humanity cries ¶

03:17.798 --> 03:20.265
¶ How society lies ¶

03:20.267 --> 03:22.901
¶ He sees with more
than his eyes ¶

03:24.405 --> 03:25.938
¶ Well, look at him runnin' ¶

03:25.940 --> 03:27.940
¶ Don't he know how to walk ¶

03:27.942 --> 03:29.474
¶ He's just too damned cunning ¶

03:29.476 --> 03:31.210
¶ You can tell by his talk ¶

03:31.212 --> 03:32.678
¶ You can tell he is rude ¶

03:32.680 --> 03:34.580
¶ Like a typical dude ¶

03:34.582 --> 03:35.914
¶ If you want my opinion ¶

03:35.916 --> 03:40.819
¶ He belongs under lock ¶

03:40.821 --> 03:44.656
¶ One look in his eyes
and you know he's unsound ¶

03:44.658 --> 03:47.526
¶ There's no way to faze him
'cause he's nobody's clown ¶

03:47.528 --> 03:50.462
¶ He's as deep as the sea
and he's equally free ¶

03:50.464 --> 03:52.531
¶ That's why I fear him
and hate him ¶

03:52.533 --> 03:57.302
¶ And wish he was down,
was down, yeah ¶

03:57.304 --> 04:00.572
¶ 'Cause whether riding
the rails out of Denver ¶

04:00.574 --> 04:03.942
¶ Or bumming his friends'
cigarettes ¶

04:03.944 --> 04:07.312
¶ He's asking them all
to remember ¶

04:07.314 --> 04:11.650
¶ Making sure that
they'll never forget ¶

04:11.652 --> 04:13.318
¶ So you're curious, friend ¶

04:13.320 --> 04:15.354
¶ 'Bout this man who I speak ¶

04:15.356 --> 04:18.624
¶ 'Cause he tears you and
scares you out of your sleep ¶

04:18.626 --> 04:21.893
¶ I'm sure you'll find,
if you open your mind ¶

04:21.895 --> 04:23.262
¶ That it's you and not he ¶

04:23.264 --> 04:27.899
¶ Who is really the freak ¶

04:27.901 --> 04:31.803
¶ Oh, relax for a moment
as you would for your hobby ¶

04:31.805 --> 04:34.873
¶ His beauty abounds
in his mind and his body ¶

04:34.875 --> 04:38.710
¶ Like a setting sun's hues,
or the dust on his shoes... ¶

04:40.314 --> 04:42.714
You can't do that!
You always do that!

04:46.287 --> 04:47.653
No, you nimrod!
It's poker!

04:47.655 --> 04:49.655
It's not whatever
you want it to be!

04:51.759 --> 04:54.359
- You could set your clock
by those two.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.994
- Here they go.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.562
- Junior, back me up!

04:57.564 --> 04:59.998
- That's it. I'm out.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.601
- Night, big daddy.
- Night, Junior.

05:04.838 --> 05:05.904
- [sighs]

05:07.608 --> 05:08.740

05:10.577 --> 05:13.378
- I'm good!
- [both laughing]

05:16.617 --> 05:19.518
- Ah, I love this place.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.386
- It's the Brook.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.057
- Come on.
- All right.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.693
- Come on. You referee.
- Ah, nah. Here we go.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.094

- Boxing glove.

06:11.105 --> 06:12.137
- Oh!

06:19.747 --> 06:21.146
Ah, shit.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.147
- You okay over there?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.086
Oh, yeah.

06:30.791 --> 06:31.857
- Okay.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.931
Oh, hey Cody!

06:39.933 --> 06:41.633
Time for school.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.670
I'll get him.

[upbeat music playing]

06:48.642 --> 06:51.009
- Hey, hey Dude, Come on.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.111
Come on, you gotta go.
- You like this song, dad?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.946
- Yeah, sure. Come on.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.182
- That's very unconvincing, dad.
It's a great song.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.850
- All right, ya' wanna' know
another great song?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.051
It's called "I didn't miss
the school bus."

07:00.053 --> 07:01.486
Let's go.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.489
Wait a minute, come here.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.826
- No, no, it's--

07:07.828 --> 07:08.994
don't make my hair like yours.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.562
- I'm not. It's sticking up.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.831
You know what,
it's-it's my hair.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.835
- Okay?
- Yep.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.572
Oh, could you turn that off?

07:20.574 --> 07:24.443
¶ - ¶

07:24.445 --> 07:25.444
[music stops]

07:30.050 --> 07:31.216
- Remember dad,
I need twenty bucks

07:31.218 --> 07:33.051
for the field trip.
- Wha...

07:33.053 --> 07:35.520
Oh, right.

07:35.522 --> 07:38.056
Twenty. Okay.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.058
Okay.
- Thanks, dad!

07:40.060 --> 07:42.127
- Wrong daughter.
- What?

07:42.129 --> 07:44.196
- Dad, I need the money!
- You?

07:44.198 --> 07:46.865
Yeah, well that's--
hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.533
- No.
- Really?

07:48.535 --> 07:50.235
- It's only fair, dad.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.671
- Dani, bring me the change.

07:52.673 --> 07:53.805
- There's no change
on a field trip.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.106
- Bye, mom!
- Bye!

07:55.108 --> 07:56.875
- Hey, hey, hey,
how about a kiss for dad?

07:56.877 --> 07:58.210
- Give your father a kiss,

07:58.212 --> 07:59.945
it's the only one
he's getting all day.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.546
- Bye, daddy. Bye, mom!
- Bye, bye.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.815
- Bye!
- Bye, girls.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.050
Wait, what?

08:05.052 --> 08:06.651
Do you have to give me
a hard time for?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.086
- Unbelievable.
- What?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.622
[laughing]

08:10.624 --> 08:12.924
You, are gonna need
a time out

08:12.926 --> 08:13.959
- You're so...
- Yep. Time out, time out.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.093
- You're the naughty one.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.836
- That was loud.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.808
- Hey.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.512
- Are we tight?

08:34.581 --> 08:35.881
- No, Ted, we're married.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.049
We got a teenage son.
We're not tight.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.217
- 'Cause I thought
we were tight.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.652
I really did.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.087
- How old are you?

08:42.089 --> 08:43.822
- What? Oh, come on.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.758
It was just a little paintball
at the Brook.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.627
- I think you just
made my point.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.697
- Mare...

08:52.699 --> 08:53.798
Mare!

- Hey, Junior.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.915
- Hilde!
Hey, where's your better half?

09:09.917 --> 09:11.249
- Junior!

09:11.251 --> 09:13.618
- Ted. Come here.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.654
- What's up?

09:15.656 --> 09:18.223
- Got a six pointer.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.624
- It's not deer season.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.293
- We'll talk.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.128
Order up!

09:23.130 --> 09:25.630
- Heard you got tagged
pretty good out there, Teddy.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.998
- Yeah, Ted.
I heard ya' took a header, huh?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.001
[laughter]

09:30.003 --> 09:31.636
- Hey, Frank.
How's it hangin'?

09:31.638 --> 09:32.871
- Hey, gravity, Hilde.

09:32.873 --> 09:36.107
Gravity always wins,
you know that.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.976
- I'm feelin' hash and eggs.
- Yeah?

09:37.978 --> 09:39.344
- Load 'em up, darlin'.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.613
- Do you look like
the only people in here?

09:43.283 --> 09:45.216
- ¶ Keep on ¶

09:45.218 --> 09:50.121
¶ Smilin' through the rain ¶

09:50.123 --> 09:54.659
¶ Laughin' at the pain ¶

09:54.661 --> 09:58.863
¶ Just rolling with changes ¶

09:58.865 --> 10:02.167
¶ 'Til the sun
comes out again ¶

10:02.169 --> 10:04.603
¶ Keep on smilin'... ¶

10:04.605 --> 10:05.870
- Hey, gorgeous.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.072
Any day.

10:09.009 --> 10:13.178
- ¶ Laughin' at the pain ¶

10:13.180 --> 10:16.615
¶ Just rolling
with the changes ¶

10:17.985 --> 10:20.018
¶ Singin' this refrain ¶

10:23.390 --> 10:26.391
[music]

10:36.236 --> 10:38.870
- Don't touch anything.
Watch your backpacks.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.873
[music]

10:47.781 --> 10:51.016
- Okay, kids, come on in.
Let's gather around this one.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.651
Come on over.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.252
I want to tell you
about this exhibit here,

10:54.254 --> 10:56.388
which is the Bernadine.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.223
Now aboard the Bernadine,

10:58.225 --> 11:00.725
these passengers left
the Port of New Orleans,

11:00.727 --> 11:02.761
headed for New York City.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.029
Now, these men and women,

11:04.031 --> 11:06.297
they had no idea
that they were doomed.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.767
But what makes this exhibit
so special

11:08.769 --> 11:11.102
is the phenomenal condition
of the historical pieces

11:11.104 --> 11:13.071
that belonged to these people,

11:13.073 --> 11:15.140
collected from this
one ship wreck.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.442
And together they create
a perfect snapshot

11:17.444 --> 11:19.210
of life in America,

11:19.212 --> 11:22.747
just before Civil War
would tear it apart.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.083
Now remember
what we learned last week;

11:25.085 --> 11:28.753
the Civil War started
in April of 1861.

11:28.755 --> 11:31.022
That was one year
after Abraham Lincoln

11:31.024 --> 11:32.290
was elected President.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.392
When seven states
in the deep south

11:34.394 --> 11:36.294
that supported
slavery seceded,

11:36.296 --> 11:37.896
forming a new nation.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.999
[flickers]

11:41.001 --> 11:42.467
- What the heck is that?

11:43.704 --> 11:46.071
- That's job security.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.106
- Ahh.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.874
- Are you really?
Still working on that?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.109
- Yeah.
- Come on.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.143
- All right.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.880
- [groaning]
- [laughing]

11:55.882 --> 11:58.116
How's that workin' out
for you?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.884
- I swear to God
I'm gonna hit you with this.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.253
[rattles]

12:02.255 --> 12:04.055
- [groaning]
- [laughs]

12:04.057 --> 12:05.290
- I just keep catching
Blue Gill,

12:05.292 --> 12:06.958
I wanna get
the Large Mouth Bass.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.326
- Well, what kind of fisherman
do you want to be?

12:08.328 --> 12:10.361
Because when I say fisherman,
it's "man",

12:10.363 --> 12:12.430
what kind of man
do you wanna be?

12:12.432 --> 12:14.432
You know?
- Yeah, I know.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.735
- Excuse me
ladies and gentlemen,

12:16.737 --> 12:19.003
the exhibit will be closing
in ten minutes.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.338
Ten minutes.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.941
Ten minutes from now.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.845
Enjoy.

12:26.847 --> 12:30.081
- The conditions,
the sediment on the sea floor,

12:30.083 --> 12:32.217
it's incredible, isn't it?

12:32.219 --> 12:33.918
Must be the pressure.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.919
- Hey guys,
I don't know if you heard,

12:34.921 --> 12:36.187
but we close in ten minutes.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.323
- This exhibit is wonderful.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.525
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.227
- We have ten minutes.
- Okay.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.528
- Well, actually nine.
- Let's go over here.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.397
- I'm sorry.
We have eight minutes.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.465
But...

12:53.306 --> 12:56.508
It's all worms, Wendall.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.476
No need for down-riggers,

12:58.478 --> 13:00.512
no need to troll, no lures,

13:00.514 --> 13:01.980
or the highly overrated chub.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.348
You don't have a chub, do you?
- No.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.349
- If you have a chub--
I will karate chop you.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.518
- No, I don't.
- Okay.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.220
It's worms.
Fish take the worm every time.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.321
What do you have
in your backyard?

13:10.323 --> 13:11.523
Go home,
look in your backyard.

13:11.525 --> 13:14.025
Under that little pool.
You have worms.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.528
You know what? You take off.
I'll lock it down.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.896
- I-I can go?

13:17.898 --> 13:19.864
- Yeah man, go.
- Ah thanks, Chip.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.099
- Yeah, sure, sure.

13:23.904 --> 13:24.969
Wendall.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.206
My locker,

13:28.208 --> 13:30.241
on top, July 02.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.876
Bongo bass.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.180
You take it home.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.081
- Wow, really?

13:42.355 --> 13:45.890
- Nah, it was an
all you can eat seafood bar.

13:45.892 --> 13:48.526
He sat down
and he ate shrimp cocktail

13:48.528 --> 13:50.395
for like an hour and a half.

13:50.397 --> 13:51.462
- Wait a minute.
You're telling me

13:51.464 --> 13:52.864
Junior got comp'd?

13:52.866 --> 13:55.166
- Yeah. Soup to nuts
at the Onondaga.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.968
- How does he do that?
- Well, you know Junior.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.103
He can hang with anybody.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.944
- Sir?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.979
The museum's closed now.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.223
- You can come back tomorrow.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.894
- The exit's
just right this way.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.178
How did Chip miss that?
[chuckles]

14:40.180 --> 14:42.046
- I don't know.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.049
- Yeah, right-right
this way, sir.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.050
Right this way.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.052
[light bulb clatters]

14:50.457 --> 14:52.657
- We have contact.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.392
Ah, hey, Twinkle Toes.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.060
Thanks for the spot?

14:56.062 --> 14:57.495
- What? You're fine.
Anyway, you're done.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.265
Come on. Get down.
It's time to go home.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.367
Let's go, let's go.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.340
[footsteps]

15:13.980 --> 15:15.079
- That's good, Hilde.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.115
Hey, I forgot my lunch box.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.182
- I got it!

15:18.184 --> 15:19.684
- All right, all right.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.921
- Did you see Chip's
new Mega Flashlight?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.589
He says it doubles as a club.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.057
- [snickers]

15:28.995 --> 15:30.028
Hilde...

15:32.299 --> 15:34.399
- How did he get back in here?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.101
- Call it in.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.946
- Oh, hey,
this is George Hildebrandt,

15:47.948 --> 15:49.347
over here at the, uh,
Museum of Art.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.316
Put me through
to the Campus Police, please.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.327
- Uh...

16:02.329 --> 16:03.361
sir?

16:06.232 --> 16:07.565
I'm sorry, Mister,
I thought we made it clear

16:07.567 --> 16:09.534
the exhibit was closed.

16:17.711 --> 16:18.977
Wait a minute...

16:26.519 --> 16:28.086
Hey.
Hey, you can't go down there!

16:28.088 --> 16:29.354
It's--come on, come on.
- I gotta go, gotta go.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.688
Thank you, send someone.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.457
Son of a...
- God damn it.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.691
- Where's he goin'?
Where's he goin'?

16:33.693 --> 16:35.259
- I have no idea.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.768
- That's a dead end.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.740
Okay.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.612
- Hey, mister.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.282
Listen...

16:58.284 --> 17:00.318
we don't want any trouble, okay?

17:04.224 --> 17:05.323
- What the...

17:08.495 --> 17:10.094
- [gasps]

17:10.096 --> 17:11.796
- Oh, sorry, kids.
Didn't mean to scare you.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.097
- Did you see a man
running out that door?

17:13.099 --> 17:14.699
- Running, running?
- No.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.633
- Where the hell did he go?
- Come on, he was just here.

17:15.635 --> 17:16.801
- What's happening?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.536
- Is he--
did he steal something?

17:18.538 --> 17:19.804
- What? Uh...I don't know.
- Ted, I'm going this way.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.406
- Okay, I'll meet you out front.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.774
- Do you think he's dangerous?
- Dange...no.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.542
I don't think that--
do you live on campus?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.411
You all together? Come on.
Let's go up the stairs this way.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.612
Come on. Come on.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.047
Ah, head back to your dorm.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.114
If you see anybody
along the way

17:30.116 --> 17:31.416
just call security, okay?

17:31.418 --> 17:32.650
You want me to walk you home?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.652
Okay, all right,
just, um, head back.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.622
Head back, keep an eye out.
All right, thank you. Thanks.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.726
[music]

17:46.266 --> 17:48.766
- [panting]

17:48.768 --> 17:50.201
Where is he?

17:52.205 --> 17:54.505
- Hey. Who opened that?

17:57.343 --> 17:59.510
- No idea.
- Oh, boy.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.697
Ted.
- Huh?

18:23.670 --> 18:24.869
- Go there.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.356
- Hey!
- [screams]

18:47.360 --> 18:48.726
- Holy shit.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.895
- Hilde!

18:50.897 --> 18:52.830
[grunts]

18:55.668 --> 18:58.136
Seriously? Seriously?!
- Yep.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.740
- I-I just don't--

19:02.742 --> 19:03.908
this actually...

19:06.412 --> 19:09.213
[indistinct radio chatter]

19:13.686 --> 19:16.254
- So, Ted and Hilde,
you're goin' after this guy,

19:16.256 --> 19:17.622
who goes out through
the basement

19:17.624 --> 19:19.457
you give chase,

19:19.459 --> 19:21.259
then you find
the front door compromised,

19:21.261 --> 19:23.294
and you come back
into the exhibit.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.463
- That's right, Chief.
- Yep, yep.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.831
- And Chip...

19:26.833 --> 19:28.266
you do not see the man,

19:28.268 --> 19:30.768
but yet,
somehow you shatter the glass.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.703
Am I getting this right?

19:36.309 --> 19:39.343
- Yes, that's right, Chief.
I broke the glass.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.246
- Okay. Uh, in my 35 years
in Law Enforcement,

19:42.248 --> 19:43.481
if there's one thing
I've learned

19:43.483 --> 19:45.883
it's that people
don't just disappear.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.318
Come on now,
let's go find this guy.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.555
Call it in.
- Okay, Chief.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.723
Consider it done,
as soon as I do it.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.358
[indistinct radio chatter]

19:54.360 --> 19:55.526
[beeps]
- All units,

19:55.528 --> 19:57.328
we have an adult,
black male,

19:57.330 --> 19:58.596
African-American suspect.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.798
I repeat.
An adult, black male.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.466
African-American suspect.

20:02.468 --> 20:05.603
- Was that Cantonese?
- Yeah, um...

20:05.605 --> 20:07.305
- Hey...
- I'll clean this.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.806
- Yeah, we'll get this, Chief.
- We'll get this, Chief.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.309
- Thank you.
- All right, see you later.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.643
Thanks.
- Thanks a lot, Chief.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.913
- What did he say?
- I have no idea.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.316
- That's whacked.
- Hey, you're the guys!

20:19.385 --> 20:20.785
- Whoa, whoa.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.387
- Did you know
that you went viral?

20:23.389 --> 20:24.922
- We went what?
- Viral?

20:24.924 --> 20:27.458
You did.
You-you went viral.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.560
You already have 2,300 views.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.761
- Did you see a man running

20:30.763 --> 20:31.996
- out that door?
- Running, running?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.531
- No.
- Where the hell did he go?

20:33.533 --> 20:34.599
- He was right here.
- What's happening?

20:34.601 --> 20:35.666
- Hey, that's a...

20:35.668 --> 20:36.767
- Can you describe the suspect?

20:36.769 --> 20:39.403
- Um, uh, and, and you are...

20:39.405 --> 20:40.838
Oh, my name is Harold Klebold.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.540
Freelance reporter
of the on-line Campus Times.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.709
- Listen, I don't think
we're at liberty to...

20:44.711 --> 20:46.944
- The suspect was black.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.480
- Uh, oh...

20:49.482 --> 20:51.482
- It's probably best
if you ask the Chief.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.683
- Can I get your names?

20:52.685 --> 20:54.785
- Yeah, uh, Ted Markham.
- George...

20:54.787 --> 20:56.254
- Ted Markham.
- ...Hildebrandt.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.589
H-I-L-D-E, BRANDT,
with a "D".

20:59.626 --> 21:01.959

21:09.402 --> 21:13.437
- Oh, my God!
Look what the sewer backed up.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.006
- They let you ladies out
on a school night?

21:15.008 --> 21:16.374
- You got the Red Bomb out?

21:16.376 --> 21:18.042
Come on, gimme' some of that.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.443
- I thought you quit?

21:22.348 --> 21:24.815
- Hey, Chip.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.418
- Chippie!
Come have a beer with us.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.053
- Ah, no that's,
that's a negative.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.455
That kinda' crosses that line.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.424
- What line is that?

21:33.426 --> 21:35.359
- The line between, uh,

21:35.361 --> 21:38.029
who I protect and, uh,
who I drink with.

21:38.031 --> 21:40.998
- Hey, Chip,
it's just a beer. Come on.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.933
- Yeah, yeah.
You can protect us

21:42.935 --> 21:45.770
while you're having a drink
with us.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.905
- Nah, I-I got--
I gotta--I gotta take off.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.007
- Chip...
- Come on, Chip, it's okay.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.008
- Yeah.

[rock music playing]

22:00.853 --> 22:01.952

22:06.826 --> 22:08.359

That's all.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.795
- Yeah, what a night.

22:10.797 --> 22:11.996

what happened.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.597
- I mean...
- Ted, whad'ya say? Two?

22:13.599 --> 22:15.032
- Minimum.
- It's appropriate.

22:15.034 --> 22:18.769
- Come on, let's do it.

freakin' happen tonight?

23:03.983 --> 23:06.584
- Right?
Was that weird or what?

23:07.653 --> 23:09.120
- Somethin' else.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.773
If you see anything unusual
just,

24:35.775 --> 24:37.107
call security or somethin',
okay?

24:37.109 --> 24:38.509
All right, good.
Do you want me to walk you?

24:38.511 --> 24:39.944

25:59.692 --> 26:01.292
- I mean, perilous?

26:01.294 --> 26:03.627
Ted, Ted, would you call that
perilous chase?

26:03.629 --> 26:05.996
I mean, this paper sucks.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.731
- And you even told the guy
how to spell your name

26:07.733 --> 26:08.799
with a "D".

26:08.801 --> 26:10.801
- Oh, I will slap you so hard.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.336
- Listen,
I look good in that thing.

I saw you on the internet.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.031

What are you doing up here?

26:55.848 --> 26:58.616
- I don't know.
Just thought I'd stop by.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.150
I didn't see you this morning.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.319
- Oh, I had an early meeting
with the Dean.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.355
I would've told you last night,
but you were out.

27:05.691 --> 27:07.257

27:10.696 --> 27:12.997
- No. What happened?

27:12.999 --> 27:14.798
- Thank you for this, Mary Ann.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.000
Will I see you
at the trustee's meeting?

27:16.002 --> 27:18.168

whatever you wanna do.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.034

Roller derby!

and he just,

28:35.147 --> 28:37.414
he just gone. Just...

28:37.416 --> 28:39.950
I run up, I reach,
I grab him, pull him in.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.253
And I was...

28:43.255 --> 28:45.089
shakin' and this...

28:46.425 --> 28:49.259
and I saw his daddy comin'
and then he--

28:49.261 --> 28:51.161
and I walk over.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.497
I walk him over
and he snatch him up.

28:53.499 --> 28:56.967
The boy's soppin' wet
in his arms.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.503
Coughing up water.

28:59.505 --> 29:02.339
He look at me and he said,

29:02.341 --> 29:05.175
"You will have a piece
of your own."

29:07.079 --> 29:10.147
"Keep it in da' box, boy.
Hear me.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.749
You keep it in da' box.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.351
Don't let nobody touch it.
You keep it safe."

29:14.353 --> 29:16.120
That's what he said.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.321
Well you was...

29:18.891 --> 29:21.759

the guy who broke in.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.990
- Yeah? What about him?

30:26.992 --> 30:28.926
- The-the guy.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.033

30:37.469 --> 30:40.037

you guys are acting

30:41.207 --> 30:42.606
really freakin' weird.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.208
And I don't know
what game it is,

30:44.210 --> 30:46.443
but I'm not playing it.

30:46.445 --> 30:50.914
We are under
a Orange Level Alert.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.383

31:19.478 --> 31:23.080
How the frick'
do we tell who about this?

31:24.984 --> 31:27.584
- I don't know if we do.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.119
What're gonna say?

31:29.121 --> 31:30.587
- I don't know.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.658
He was standing right there.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.159
And Chip didn't see him.

31:36.161 --> 31:37.961
- Nope. He did not.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.062
He did not.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.164
- Ted, he didn't see him.

31:41.166 --> 31:44.434
- I-I just said that.
He did not.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.208
- Who else doesn't see him?

32:09.628 --> 32:11.128
- Ted?

32:11.130 --> 32:13.163
- Yep.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.632
- Did ya' have fun last night?

32:15.634 --> 32:16.700

- You know,

32:16.702 --> 32:19.102
you left your gate open.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.707
- I left the gate open, okay.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.008
- Uh-hmm.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.713
You know, I really don't mind
you being out late with Hilde.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.249
Unscheduled boys night out,
whatever.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.184
But, it would be really nice

32:34.186 --> 32:36.320
if you could keep that pretty
good rhythm thing goin'?

32:36.322 --> 32:38.655
You know, that thing
that we've been doing forever?

32:38.657 --> 32:42.025
That little thing
where you wake up early

32:42.027 --> 32:45.162
and make the coffee,
your part of the day?

32:45.164 --> 32:49.132
Since I gotta be at work
three hours before you do?

32:49.134 --> 32:50.334
Ted?

33:05.584 --> 33:07.351

33:09.121 --> 33:11.421

a question.

33:22.534 --> 33:23.734

Didn't mean to sneak up on you.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.405
Are you nervous?

34:35.407 --> 34:37.574

36:11.937 --> 36:13.670
and go to a motel room?

36:13.672 --> 36:15.205
- It's not Prom night.

47:24.409 --> 47:27.510
- Yes, sir I...

47:27.512 --> 47:29.212
Now I, I remember

47:29.214 --> 47:30.279
I was on the deck,

47:32.016 --> 47:34.350
and-and a wind

47:34.352 --> 47:37.119
come in with so much rain
that even,

47:37.121 --> 47:39.455
even the ocean couldn't hold it.

47:40.558 --> 47:43.492
And then, then the waves come.

47:45.196 --> 47:47.396
The water was...

47:47.398 --> 47:50.199
was filling up
all over the place.

47:50.201 --> 47:53.202
And it was so dark,

47:53.204 --> 47:56.505
and it push against you so hard.

47:59.110 --> 48:00.509
I just couldn't reach it, I...

48:04.649 --> 48:06.115
- Reach what?

48:09.654 --> 48:11.621
- I saved his boy.

48:11.623 --> 48:13.322
Yeah...
- Who's boy?

48:13.324 --> 48:14.891
- I-I did.

48:14.893 --> 48:16.359
Couldn't swim a lick, that boy,
and then,

48:16.361 --> 48:17.994
and I wasn't going to
let him hit no bottom.

48:17.996 --> 48:19.595
No sir, I wasn't gonna let that
happen to him.

48:19.597 --> 48:20.663
I remember

48:20.665 --> 48:21.998
I, I grabbed him,

48:22.000 --> 48:23.466
pulled him on out and I,

48:23.468 --> 48:25.101
and when I got him out
I could see Master Ribeaux

48:25.103 --> 48:26.335
running across the field,

48:26.337 --> 48:28.271
and he just grab him
out of my arms,

48:28.273 --> 48:29.605
just take him
and squeeze him up,

48:29.607 --> 48:32.508
he wet and cryin', and then...

48:34.178 --> 48:35.344
and then the Master look,

48:35.346 --> 48:37.046
he look right at me.

48:40.985 --> 48:42.551
He said, "Thank you, Gil"

48:46.524 --> 48:48.624
Master said, "Thank you, Gil."

48:52.497 --> 48:55.197
And then...

48:55.199 --> 48:57.967
then he told me, he said...

48:57.969 --> 48:59.435
"Listen here, boy.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.607
I can't free you...

49:04.609 --> 49:06.142
open.

49:08.479 --> 49:09.512
Not here."

49:09.513 --> 49:10.546

a piece of my own.

- She was on the boat, too.

49:28.166 --> 49:29.231
- She was.

49:32.637 --> 49:36.038
- Do you know that
you died on that boat?

49:43.581 --> 49:45.314
- That what I did?

51:01.125 --> 51:02.725
- What's going on with what?

51:02.727 --> 51:04.660
- Come on, I know my husband.

51:04.662 --> 51:05.761
- Rach...

51:05.763 --> 51:07.663
- Don't Rach me.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.669
I haven't had any.

51:17.442 --> 51:19.542
- You're my best friend.

51:19.544 --> 51:21.844

52:08.226 --> 52:10.392

52:10.394 --> 52:12.461
I got bagels, coffee's on.

52:14.532 --> 52:15.698
I gotta go.
- Do, um...

52:15.700 --> 52:17.633
- See you later.

52:17.635 --> 52:18.701
- Uh, hmm.

52:27.411 --> 52:29.411
- What's up? Why so early?

52:30.815 --> 52:32.314
- I think it's a deed.

52:32.316 --> 52:34.183
- What's a deed?

52:34.185 --> 52:35.384
- I went to the Museum
last night.

52:35.386 --> 52:36.619
Here, you drive.

52:36.621 --> 52:38.821
- Wait, wait,
you went where when?

52:38.823 --> 52:41.423
- You know that display case?

52:41.425 --> 52:43.859
The one with the box,
the one that Gil was talking to?

52:43.861 --> 52:45.661
In that box,

52:45.663 --> 52:47.496
is the deed to his land.
- Wait, slow down.

52:47.498 --> 52:49.398
What box? What land?

52:49.400 --> 52:50.699
- Remember how Gil
was saying something

52:50.701 --> 52:52.501
about his master
giving him what was his?

52:52.503 --> 52:54.603
A piece of his own?
- Yeah.

52:54.605 --> 52:56.872
- Yeah, well the deed to his own
is in that box.

52:56.874 --> 52:58.507
Come on, I'll tell you.

53:00.278 --> 53:03.279
[car engine revving]

53:05.850 --> 53:08.851
- Um, it-it appears
to be a legal document.

53:08.853 --> 53:09.885
It's got a seal.

53:09.887 --> 53:11.687
It says New York.

53:11.689 --> 53:12.855
I figured if anyone knew

53:12.857 --> 53:15.491
it would be the County Clerk.

53:15.493 --> 53:17.960
And-and these numbers
right here.

53:17.962 --> 53:20.229
All those numbers right there
were on it.

53:20.231 --> 53:22.698
And, uh, the name Gil Le Deux.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.633
Gotta be a record of it
somewhere, right?

53:24.635 --> 53:26.869
- Well, there might be.

53:26.871 --> 53:28.370
Just maybe not here.

53:28.372 --> 53:29.638
Like I said,
it's really difficult

53:29.640 --> 53:32.975
without having the actual deed
in hand.

53:32.977 --> 53:35.311
Not a lot of information here.

53:35.313 --> 53:38.914
It's like asking me
to identify an octopus...

53:38.916 --> 53:40.416
without it's legs.

I...I'm sorry.

53:59.870 --> 54:01.837
- Have a nice day.

54:01.839 --> 54:03.305
- Just-just follow me on this,

54:03.307 --> 54:04.440
maybe it wasn't recorded,

54:04.442 --> 54:05.774
maybe the transfer of the land,

54:05.776 --> 54:07.743
or the legal whatever,
never took place.

54:07.745 --> 54:09.578
I mean, think about it.
Right?

54:09.580 --> 54:11.580
He never got there.
Somebody's gotta' own it, right?

54:11.582 --> 54:12.815
- Absolutely.

54:12.817 --> 54:14.583
- Well, that's what I'm say...

54:14.585 --> 54:16.252
- Holy shit.

54:22.760 --> 54:23.926
- What's he doin' there?

54:23.928 --> 54:25.794
- Look who it is,
the dynamic duo.

54:25.796 --> 54:26.895
Where you been?

1:10:58.622 --> 1:10:59.887
- No.

1:11:09.633 --> 1:11:12.267
- I come back here tonight,
'cause I figure that if,

1:11:12.269 --> 1:11:13.534
you know...

1:11:14.971 --> 1:11:17.438
something could go wrong,
and it did,

1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:19.741
and maybe it could happen again,

1:11:19.743 --> 1:11:22.043
and I wanted to go
that extra mile.

1:11:22.045 --> 1:11:23.278
For the job.

1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:24.779
For the sake of making sure

1:11:24.781 --> 1:11:26.447
that everything
is gonna be all right.

1:11:26.449 --> 1:11:29.684
I mean, he may be out there...

1:11:29.686 --> 1:11:30.918
but he's not gonna be in here.

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:32.687
No sirree, no Bob, no.

1:11:32.689 --> 1:11:35.323
Not on my watch.

1:11:35.325 --> 1:11:38.326
So, I post one of my guys
outside the front door.

1:11:39.396 --> 1:11:41.496
And guess what I saw.

1:11:41.498 --> 1:11:44.465
I saw our local heroes.

1:11:44.467 --> 1:11:45.900
Which makes me wonder.

1:11:48.305 --> 1:11:49.871
Did you get another call?

1:11:49.873 --> 1:11:52.707
Was there another
"electrical incident"

1:11:52.709 --> 1:11:54.542
and so they called you guys?

1:11:54.544 --> 1:11:56.611
- Chip--
- You guys are maintenance.

1:11:58.381 --> 1:12:00.848
You maintain things.
I'm supposed to be security,

1:12:00.850 --> 1:12:03.084
but apparently
I don't secure much of anything.

1:12:08.625 --> 1:12:11.359
I thought you guys
were taking it to 11...

1:12:13.096 --> 1:12:14.696
but really...

1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:19.967
all you were really doing
was taking.

1:12:19.969 --> 1:12:22.737
- Wait. Chip.

1:12:22.739 --> 1:12:26.741
It's just an old a deed,
to a piece of land,

1:12:26.743 --> 1:12:29.911
and we just need to borrow it
for a short time.

1:12:29.913 --> 1:12:32.547
That's it. And then we're gonna
put it back.

1:12:34.517 --> 1:12:36.718
- But what does it have
to do with you?

1:12:41.825 --> 1:12:44.592
You know what? Listen.

1:12:47.731 --> 1:12:49.731
I don't know what you guys
are gonna do with that thing,

1:12:49.733 --> 1:12:51.499
you know what,
I don't wanna know.

1:12:54.871 --> 1:12:57.438
But I'm gonna give you one day.

1:12:57.440 --> 1:12:59.507
That's it. 24 hours.

1:13:00.944 --> 1:13:03.878
And then you're gonna bring
it back to me.

1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:05.813
You're gonna give it to me.
- You got it.

1:13:05.815 --> 1:13:07.048
- Okay.

1:13:09.619 --> 1:13:11.586
- Me only, okay?

1:13:11.588 --> 1:13:12.987
- Yeah.
- Yep.

1:13:23.500 --> 1:13:26.934
[music]

1:13:58.635 --> 1:14:01.636
[vacuum whirring]

1:14:13.550 --> 1:14:16.651
- Oh. Hey, Sweetie.
- Hey.

1:14:16.653 --> 1:14:18.052
I can't believe
you slept there all night.

1:14:18.054 --> 1:14:19.987
I tried to wake you up.
- I know.

1:14:19.989 --> 1:14:21.489
- You didn't wake up.

1:14:21.491 --> 1:14:22.490
- Hi.
- You didn't wake up

1:14:22.492 --> 1:14:23.458
when the girls left.

1:14:23.460 --> 1:14:24.892
- Oh no, I know.

1:14:37.807 --> 1:14:39.207
Hey, Rach.
- Oh, God.

1:14:39.209 --> 1:14:41.809
I thought you were downstairs.
- Sorry, uh...

1:14:41.811 --> 1:14:43.978
I just, uh, need to take
those papers to work.

1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:46.681
Didn't want to forget 'em.
- What is this?

1:14:46.683 --> 1:14:48.049
- Uh, it's an old map.

1:14:48.051 --> 1:14:50.685
Um, can I have it?

1:14:50.687 --> 1:14:52.220
Don't, but, don't-don't-

1:14:52.222 --> 1:14:53.754
don't bend it like that, Rach.

1:14:53.756 --> 1:14:55.089
It's a hundred
and fifty years old.

1:14:55.091 --> 1:14:56.157
- What are you doing
with it then?

1:14:56.159 --> 1:14:57.625
- Just give it to me?

1:14:59.062 --> 1:15:00.628
Please.

1:15:07.737 --> 1:15:10.571
Okay. The man?

1:15:10.573 --> 1:15:12.540
That we were chasing
in the Museum that night?

1:15:12.542 --> 1:15:14.575
- Uh-huh.

1:15:14.577 --> 1:15:16.010
- That's him.

1:15:17.747 --> 1:15:19.981
- What's him? Who's him?
- The-the black guy.

1:15:19.983 --> 1:15:22.517
That everyone's looking for.
- But you just said

1:15:22.519 --> 1:15:24.252
it's a hundred
and fifty years old.

1:15:24.254 --> 1:15:25.786
- I know it's crazy.

1:15:25.788 --> 1:15:27.855
I just want to help him
get back home,

1:15:27.857 --> 1:15:29.957
and then I'll take it
back to the museum.

1:15:31.928 --> 1:15:33.728
- You took this from the museum?

1:15:33.730 --> 1:15:36.697
From the college where you work?

1:15:36.699 --> 1:15:39.066
Do you know what's gonna happen
when they find this missing?

1:15:39.068 --> 1:15:41.569
You'll lose your job.
- I'm not gonna lose my job.

1:15:41.571 --> 1:15:43.237
- You would put this family,
this place,

1:15:43.239 --> 1:15:45.873
everything we eek out
for a living at risk?

1:15:45.875 --> 1:15:47.875
- Nothing's gonna be at risk.

1:15:47.877 --> 1:15:49.544
- Really?

1:15:49.546 --> 1:15:50.811
You sure about that?

1:15:57.687 --> 1:15:59.020
- Ted?

1:16:01.624 --> 1:16:02.790
- Yeah?

1:16:04.227 --> 1:16:06.160
- Where's your girlfriend going
so early?

1:16:12.168 --> 1:16:14.101
- Uh...

1:16:14.103 --> 1:16:16.203
can you help me clean up
a little bit? I gotta...

1:16:16.205 --> 1:16:17.171
- Go.

1:16:18.575 --> 1:16:19.774
- Okay.

1:16:37.727 --> 1:16:39.293
What'd you have in mind
for that?

1:16:40.797 --> 1:16:42.363
- I was gonna put it back.

1:16:47.270 --> 1:16:48.836
- Okay.

1:16:56.379 --> 1:16:58.212
Did you tell Rachel?

1:17:01.117 --> 1:17:02.950
Ah, no.

1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:06.253
- Is it worth it, Ted?

1:17:08.257 --> 1:17:09.890
- Is it worth it?

1:17:13.062 --> 1:17:15.896
I don't know, Hilde,
but I'll tell you somethin'.

1:17:19.335 --> 1:17:21.902
If it doesn't work out,
or we don't find Gil

1:17:21.904 --> 1:17:24.071
or his land by tonight...

1:17:26.075 --> 1:17:28.676
we're gonna bring that back,
we're gonna give it to Chip,

1:17:28.678 --> 1:17:31.145
the exhibit reopens,
nobody's the wiser,

1:17:31.147 --> 1:17:32.980
and nobody...

1:17:32.982 --> 1:17:34.649
is gonna get hurt by it.

1:17:34.651 --> 1:17:37.251
- If we get caught,
we lose our jobs.

1:17:37.253 --> 1:17:40.855
- If we get caught,
we're goin' to jail. [laughs]

1:17:40.857 --> 1:17:42.323
- Oh, come on.
You think this is funny?

1:17:42.325 --> 1:17:45.159
- No. No, I...

1:17:45.161 --> 1:17:46.360
I don't.

1:17:47.664 --> 1:17:49.296
Hilde.

1:17:49.298 --> 1:17:51.732
I do not think that Chip
is gonna tell anybody.

1:17:51.734 --> 1:17:53.200
We're the closest thing
he has to friends.

1:17:53.202 --> 1:17:56.737
I know that sounds pathetic,
but it's true.

1:17:56.739 --> 1:17:58.806
We've got to do this.

1:17:59.809 --> 1:18:01.842
- Why?

1:18:01.844 --> 1:18:03.177
- I don't know.

1:18:05.948 --> 1:18:08.182
But when's the last time
you felt like this?

1:18:10.219 --> 1:18:12.119
- I just can't shake
this sense I have

1:18:12.121 --> 1:18:13.688
that he's here, right now.

1:18:13.690 --> 1:18:15.756
Not just because he's lost.

1:18:15.758 --> 1:18:17.458
- Yeah, but I really think
he is lost.

1:18:17.460 --> 1:18:20.227
- Yeah, but we ain't.

1:18:20.229 --> 1:18:22.830
Everything was fine, Ted.

1:18:22.832 --> 1:18:24.965
And then Gil shows up
and everything is different

1:18:24.967 --> 1:18:26.333
with Rachel.

1:18:26.335 --> 1:18:28.469
- And I guess everything
is different with me,

1:18:28.471 --> 1:18:29.970
I mean, I don't know.

1:18:29.972 --> 1:18:32.707
I don't know if I'm ready
to be different.

1:18:37.046 --> 1:18:38.212
What?

1:18:39.916 --> 1:18:41.315
- That was good.

1:18:41.317 --> 1:18:43.017
- Stop it.
- It was.

1:18:43.019 --> 1:18:45.252
- It's not funny.
- Hey, I'm serious. It was good.

1:18:45.254 --> 1:18:48.255
[music]

1:18:53.763 --> 1:18:55.496
- Are we really gonna do this?

1:18:58.501 --> 1:19:00.234
- Yeah.

1:19:00.236 --> 1:19:02.103
[phone ringing]

1:19:03.439 --> 1:19:05.072
- Dean Stoddard's office.

1:19:05.074 --> 1:19:06.240
- Hey, Mary Ann, it's Rachel.

1:19:07.477 --> 1:19:09.376
- Hey, Rach, what's up?

1:19:09.378 --> 1:19:12.213
- Hey, do you know
what's going on with the boys?

1:19:12.215 --> 1:19:15.883
- Um, I can't say that I do, no.

1:19:15.885 --> 1:19:18.018
- About what they took
from the Museum?

1:19:20.356 --> 1:19:23.090
- I'm sorry, what?

1:19:23.092 --> 1:19:26.260
- ¶ - I knew and I'll be
gone by half past 3:00 ¶

1:19:26.262 --> 1:19:30.431
¶ Some gal would come -
always be... ¶

1:19:30.433 --> 1:19:32.767
- [clears throat] Excuse me.

1:19:32.769 --> 1:19:34.435
Um, are you open yet?

1:19:34.437 --> 1:19:36.804
- We don't open
for another 15 minutes.

1:19:36.806 --> 1:19:39.073
- Um, I don't know
if you remember us or not?

1:19:39.075 --> 1:19:41.008
- I do.

1:19:41.010 --> 1:19:42.476
- We got the deed.

1:19:42.478 --> 1:19:45.112
- Yeah, the one
that you asked for.

1:19:45.114 --> 1:19:46.914
- This is highly unusual, but...

1:19:46.916 --> 1:19:51.118
- ¶ You make me feel like
a - skill over all my - ¶

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:53.187
- And that's the end
of lesson three.

1:19:53.189 --> 1:19:54.922
- Please be very careful
with it.

1:19:54.924 --> 1:19:56.056
- Always.

1:19:56.058 --> 1:19:57.925
- Oh, my. This is a...

1:19:57.927 --> 1:20:01.061
beautiful, beautiful document.

1:20:01.063 --> 1:20:03.063
Let me see.

1:20:03.065 --> 1:20:04.865
1857.

1:20:04.867 --> 1:20:06.367
Where did you get this?

1:20:06.369 --> 1:20:08.435
- Uh, it's a family thing.

1:20:08.437 --> 1:20:11.071
- You have French heritage
from New Orleans?

1:20:11.073 --> 1:20:12.439
- Mother's side.

1:20:13.876 --> 1:20:15.476
- His.

1:20:15.478 --> 1:20:16.510
- That's interesting.

1:20:16.512 --> 1:20:18.212
This--

1:20:18.214 --> 1:20:20.080
it really should be in a museum.

1:20:21.350 --> 1:20:23.818
- Can you tell
by looking at it, um,

1:20:23.820 --> 1:20:26.086
who might own this property now?

1:20:26.088 --> 1:20:28.222
- Hmm.

1:20:28.224 --> 1:20:30.324
Let me...

1:20:30.326 --> 1:20:32.326
look at something.

1:20:34.096 --> 1:20:36.130
I may have it here.

1:20:44.207 --> 1:20:46.974
It should be right here
but it's not, um--

1:20:46.976 --> 1:20:49.076
if it was unclaimed property,

1:20:49.078 --> 1:20:51.312
then the Transfer of Ownership

1:20:51.314 --> 1:20:53.547
may have never taken place.

1:20:53.549 --> 1:20:56.584
What were the names
associated with this?

1:20:56.586 --> 1:20:59.286
- Ribeux and, uh, Gil Le Deux.

1:21:04.093 --> 1:21:05.359
- Here. Here it is.

1:21:05.361 --> 1:21:06.527
- Wow, oh wow.
- Right here.

1:21:06.529 --> 1:21:08.896
- He found it, he found it.

1:21:08.898 --> 1:21:11.498
- "Ribeux" owned it

1:21:11.500 --> 1:21:13.968
for a very short time.

1:21:13.970 --> 1:21:16.370
And apparently,
this Gil Le Deux fellow

1:21:16.372 --> 1:21:19.206
never claimed his land.

1:21:19.208 --> 1:21:22.309
And the County sold it
at auction

1:21:22.311 --> 1:21:25.212
in 1878 to a...

1:21:25.214 --> 1:21:28.649
Theodore Maxwell Markham.

1:21:31.921 --> 1:21:35.155
- That's why he's here.
- That's why it's us.

1:21:35.157 --> 1:21:38.592
[music]

1:21:38.594 --> 1:21:40.127
- Not here.

1:21:40.129 --> 1:21:41.929
- Nope. Come on.

1:21:41.931 --> 1:21:44.932
[music]

1:21:46.202 --> 1:21:49.036
- Gil!
- Hey, Gil!

1:21:51.941 --> 1:21:53.240
- Gil!

1:21:53.242 --> 1:21:56.243
[music]

1:21:56.245 --> 1:21:59.246
[birds chirping]

1:22:23.539 --> 1:22:24.972
- Hilde.

1:22:24.974 --> 1:22:27.541
- What?
- Hilde, come here. Come here.

1:22:27.543 --> 1:22:29.410
- What?

1:22:29.412 --> 1:22:32.246
- Right there. See the rock?
Right there?

1:22:32.248 --> 1:22:34.081
- Yeah, I do.
- Right there, look.

1:22:35.351 --> 1:22:36.650
- It--

1:22:36.652 --> 1:22:39.153
oh, that's--

1:22:39.155 --> 1:22:40.154
it's right here.
- It's right here.

1:22:40.156 --> 1:22:41.388
It's right here.

1:22:42.992 --> 1:22:45.659
It's right here.
- It's right here, Ted.

1:22:45.661 --> 1:22:47.227
- Oh, my...

1:22:50.166 --> 1:22:52.266
It's right there.

1:22:52.268 --> 1:22:54.068
- It's right there!
- We gotta find him.

1:22:54.070 --> 1:22:55.703
- Where do you think he is,
the Museum?

1:22:55.705 --> 1:22:59.273

- What's goin' on, Ted?

1:25:00.529 --> 1:25:03.330
I just got a call
from Chief Baumgartner.

1:25:12.641 --> 1:25:15.676
- Did you tell her?
Did she tell you about the man?

1:25:15.678 --> 1:25:17.511
About the--
- Yeah. I told her.

1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:32.459
What are you telling me?

1:25:32.461 --> 1:25:33.861
- I'm telling you
that he's here,

1:25:33.863 --> 1:25:37.164
right now, in the house.

1:25:37.166 --> 1:25:38.632
- He wasn't down there, Ted.

1:25:38.634 --> 1:25:41.568
He's not down...

1:25:41.570 --> 1:25:43.770

1:25:43.772 --> 1:25:44.905
you see him, too?

1:25:44.907 --> 1:25:46.807
- It's okay, Rach.

1:25:50.479 --> 1:25:52.346
- What do you see, Ted?

1:25:54.183 --> 1:25:55.649
- He's sitting
on the bottom step.

1:25:55.651 --> 1:25:58.252

is that he's real.

1:26:18.774 --> 1:26:21.642
And he wants--

1:26:22.778 --> 1:26:25.479
no, he needs to go home.

where that is.

Rach is gonna kill me.
