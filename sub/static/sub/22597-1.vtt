00:30.998 --> 00:33.334
Come on!

00:45.245 --> 00:46.580
Let's do it!

00:50.050 --> 00:53.987
That's me, and this is
the only decent part of my day.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.358
After this my life
only looks good on paper.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.777
- First time I killed one..
- Yeah.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.647
So special.
All that blood was magnificent.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.551
I watched it.
It wasn't that special.

02:30.618 --> 02:34.021
And these are my friends.
They're a little weird.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.657
Isn't that right, Sean?

02:36.724 --> 02:38.726
'Look, we're just trying
to help you with your mom.'

02:38.792 --> 02:40.728
Wait, so you want me
to slit her throat?

02:40.794 --> 02:43.163
The Val Moreth
is your mom, Sean.

02:43.230 --> 02:47.000
She's the most dangerous crafty
creature in all of Allenton.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.602
She's ethereal.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.103
She's beautiful.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.673
The kind of woman
knights would fight to save.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.342
But it's all a clever ruse
just to lure you in.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.645
Can't go to her unprepared.
Unh-unh.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.581
Too many good plans have been
sacrificed and slaughtered

03:00.648 --> 03:03.183
at her perfectly manicured feet.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.685
Hey, don't talk
about my mom's feet.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.920
- That's weird.
- Focus, man.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.389
We're helping you here. It's not
like you're related so--

03:09.457 --> 03:10.658
Alright. That's it. I'm out.

03:10.724 --> 03:13.561
I don't need to hear that.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.062
Alright.
So, are you coming this weekend?

03:15.128 --> 03:16.096
I'll be there.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.931
Thank you, baby Jesus.

03:17.998 --> 03:21.368
Oh, for the record, I beat the
Val Moreth in under two hours.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.803
- Fuck!
- Ouch.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.138
Easy goes..
Two hours, dude?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.274
- That's..
- You cheater.

03:27.340 --> 03:30.010
Your mom's a cheater,
and that's why you're alive.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.655
Alright, just look at page 92.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.356
I have two women in my life.

03:43.423 --> 03:48.128
One I wanna get away from,
and one I wish I could see.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.663
The first is my mom.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.398
She sends me a checklist
I have to complete

03:51.465 --> 03:54.535
by the end of the day,
every day.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.103
The second woman is Chloe.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.139
She texts me all day
asking to hang out.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.543
Even though she lives
on the other side of the state.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.614
Sean?

04:06.680 --> 04:09.817
Um, I don't know.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.052
I didn't ask you a question.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.021
Oh!

04:14.822 --> 04:16.023
Oh, um..

04:17.057 --> 04:18.625
My bad.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.332
Anything you wanna talk about?

04:25.398 --> 04:27.100
Uh, no.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.369
Just spaced out a bit.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.972
For the whole class?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.774
Part of it.

04:33.841 --> 04:37.344
I caught.. Yeah, I was spaced
out for most of it.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.912
Mm-hmm.
Well, I'll make you a deal.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.915
You show up on Monday,
alert and engaged

04:41.982 --> 04:43.717
and I'll pretend you weren't
lookin' at your phone.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.487
What if I wasn't
lookin' at my phone?

04:47.555 --> 04:48.656
Well, then we have
to call your folks in

04:48.722 --> 04:50.558
for a little chat.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.794
So, Monday,
alert, engaged, and ready.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.095
- Mm.
- Thank you, Mrs. Lucas.

04:55.162 --> 04:58.165
Have a wonderful weekend.
Bye.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.035
But I'm not going anywhere.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.871
I'm my mom's favorite
science experiment.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.306
She used to measure
the pH level of my pee.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.340
Yeah, like a psycho.

05:07.407 --> 05:08.842
Hi, mom.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.410
Lots of skateboard
traffic today?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.112
It's like a minute past 3:30.

05:12.179 --> 05:14.715
Or was it that
the wave traffic was good?

05:14.782 --> 05:17.450
Yeah, well, all we have
is a quiz review today.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.219
So, I knew I aced that.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.321
Oh. Did you now?

05:21.388 --> 05:23.624
Read it and weep.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.025
Well done.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.760
Don't let that face fool you.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.061
She's trying
to find a reason for me

05:28.128 --> 05:30.030
not to go surf camping
this weekend.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.633
She's great at saying one thing
when she means another.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.636
Luckily, I know how
to read the subtitles.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.204
Be careful. It's hot.

05:37.270 --> 05:41.508
Don't forget that
there's gluten in soy sauce.

05:41.575 --> 05:42.710
You really wanna go?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.845
I will text you.
I will call you.

05:44.912 --> 05:48.215
I will email you
if there's 4G. Okay?

05:48.281 --> 05:50.450
Go, seriously.
Have fun this weekend.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.219
You and dad,
20 years together.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.021
- It's awesome.
- Okay, little fish.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.356
Well, listen, I'm gonna go
and pick up dad from work.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.859
And I can give you a ride
to piano if you like.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.894
Don't worry about me. Just go.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.195
Always better to be early.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.364
I am not going to piano.

06:04.431 --> 06:05.498
I need a diversion.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.200
I was thinking..

06:07.267 --> 06:09.603
Is there any chance that we
could change piano to Tuesday?

06:09.670 --> 06:14.541
Mnm-mnm, no. Math tutor is on
Tuesdays and so is tennis.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.809
Maybe we could drop tennis?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.344
Sweetie, we talked about this.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.613
You know colleges are really
competitive right now.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.148
You have to be well-rounded.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.084
Just would really love
some time with myself, to..

06:24.151 --> 06:26.019
Waste.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.622
Can I at least skate to piano?

06:28.689 --> 06:31.158
Please?

06:32.059 --> 06:35.128
Alright. Okay.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.631
But be careful,
and don't be late.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.499
I won't.
Hey, have fun this weekend.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.369
Mm. Yeah.

06:42.435 --> 06:45.973
- I'll miss you.
- Miss you too.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.207
Clean that up
when you're done.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.442
Okay? Thank you.

06:49.509 --> 06:52.880
And that is how you dislodge
a helicopter parent.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.481
I can't believe
she actually fell for it.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.116
She's totally off her game.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.985
Oh, Lord.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.878
She's texting me now because
I should still be at piano.

07:57.945 --> 08:01.048
Piano was explosive.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.250
Not falling for that one.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.523
This isn't good.
My friends are right.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.893
The Val Moreth isn't going down
easy this time.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.627
She's even roped my dad in.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.229
But if I can crack him

08:16.296 --> 08:18.165
she's done for.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.071
So you guys haven't left yet.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.773
We just wanted to check
on our piano prodigy.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.174
Oh, honey, just let him explain.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.708
The Val Moreth isn't going down
easy this time.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.043
Maybe because I'm tired
of going to piano.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.711
But you said that
you agreed.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.712
No, I didn't agree.
You just made me.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.715
We pay for piano,
you go to piano.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.350
Well, easy, fix it. Don't pay.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.320
Look, Sean, how can we trust you
to be responsible

08:40.386 --> 08:43.023
on a trip,
if you lie to my face?

08:44.091 --> 08:46.026
Answer your mother.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.460
Technically, you were the one
that said I could go

08:47.527 --> 08:48.962
so that makes you the liar.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.831
No, actually,
that makes you grounded.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.865
- Ahem!
- You know, you promised.

08:51.932 --> 08:52.933
What makes you think

08:53.000 --> 08:54.601
our promises are unconditional?

08:54.667 --> 08:55.836
I don't know
what she promised him

08:55.903 --> 08:57.404
but he's not budging.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.206
I'm gonna have
to attack her where it hurts.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.941
I don't know, maybe
because I thought you loved me.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.575
You know what,
that may work with your mother

09:02.642 --> 09:04.812
but you need to learn that
your actions have consequences.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.180
Actions? What actions?

09:07.247 --> 09:08.816
I don't even
get out of the house.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.650
You know what,
you're not going.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.486
Great. Well, that's what
you wanted. Right, mom?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.688
So, congratulations.
You win.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.358
Just go tell Brent's mother
there's been a change in plans.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.063
What are you doing?

09:23.130 --> 09:24.832
I'm taking what's mine.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.466
That was my
birthday present.

09:26.533 --> 09:29.402
When you start acting like you
deserve it, you can have it.

09:29.469 --> 09:32.105
So, you're just gonna leave me
here without anything to do?

09:32.172 --> 09:34.808
I'm sure you can find a book
or something to read.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.211
It's not yours.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.513
Stop it.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.221
Nothing in this house is yours

09:48.288 --> 09:50.157
because you didn't pay for it.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.293
Your clothes, your games
or your surfboard. Nothing.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.895
Well, maybe you should call
the adoption agency

09:54.962 --> 09:56.396
and see if you can
get your money back, huh?

09:56.463 --> 09:59.032
You know what, just stop
being melodramatic. Okay?

09:59.099 --> 10:02.169
This is about consequences.
There's plenty of kids--

10:02.235 --> 10:03.871
Whose parents let them do
whatever they want.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.272
Please, could you point me
in their direction

10:05.338 --> 10:08.608
'cause I would love
to find a set of those.

10:08.675 --> 10:11.478
I am locking up your surfboards.

10:14.882 --> 10:18.585
Little fish! Sean?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.088
You made this choice, Sean.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.023
So, you're gonna
have to deal with it.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.258
Lisa.

10:28.661 --> 10:32.432
Val Moreth always rubs it in
when she wins.

10:32.499 --> 10:35.568
This is my life.
Be perfect or suffer.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.770
But I'm done trying.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.007
I'm gonna find the spare key
to unlock my boards

10:40.073 --> 10:41.474
and then I'm gonna go surfing

10:41.541 --> 10:44.011
until my parents
come home Sunday night.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.270
Look, I swear to God
my parents are evil.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.675
No, they set me up.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.677
'You didn't wanna go,
you should have just said so.'

11:17.744 --> 11:19.512
I've, I, that..

11:23.917 --> 11:26.419
I'll be honest.
I'm not handling this well.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.289
There's only one way
to turn this day around.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.529
Chloe.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.403
So, I take it
you want me to come up?

12:18.105 --> 12:20.974
Alright, well, cool, well, uh..

12:21.041 --> 12:23.343
You know, text me
where to meet you.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.612
Alright, I'll see you in a few.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.484
Play cool, play cool.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.521
Alright.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.630
This is the best decision
I've ever made.

12:43.696 --> 12:47.000
Drive time will be
eight hours four minutes.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.601
Oh, damn.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.946
Chloe messaged me
out of the blue

13:00.013 --> 13:01.414
like six months ago.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.983
She's like a tornado
inside a hurricane.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.086
But in the best way possible.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.231
If I don't kill myself on
the way, this will be amazing.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.484
You know you can step
on the gas pedal.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.354
What a chuchu.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.904
I should be worried,
but what are they gonna do?

14:31.971 --> 14:34.141
We don't even have a basement
they can lock me in.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.277
As long as they don't check
the tracker, I'll be fine.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.988
You'd think I never
left the house alone before.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.523
Alright, I haven't.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.858
- Whoa!
- Relax, relax, relax.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.128
Why are you in my car?

15:29.196 --> 15:31.331
Great question.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.800
Uh, this is my hotel.

15:33.866 --> 15:39.071
Hot.. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
I, I'm, yeah, I'm sorry, um..

15:39.138 --> 15:40.640
I just crashed last night.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.410
No, I noticed. I was just tryin'
to, like, figure out, like

15:43.476 --> 15:47.747
what's so good about, you know,
the car, better than my hotel.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.950
Oh, don't get me wrong. This is
a very, very, very nice car.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.118
That's kinda playing it.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.953
But shitty hotel, right?

15:54.020 --> 15:55.322
I mean,
no bathroom for starters.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.057
No continental breakfast
for you.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.060
But we have free electricity
for you to just plug in. Right?

16:01.127 --> 16:04.897
Oh, oh, oh, yeah. Um, I'm sorry
about that, I can, um..

16:04.964 --> 16:07.600
I got a, I got a card
I can pitch in.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.903
But you-you-you-you're missing
the point entirely.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.739
- There's a point?
- I'll tell you what.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.942
You unplug your spaceship,
get off my lot.

16:16.008 --> 16:19.178
And I'll consider not calling
the cops. How about that?

16:20.780 --> 16:25.017
Oh, a 100 percent.

16:25.084 --> 16:26.853
Um, yeah, but, now, yeah, now.

16:26.919 --> 16:31.190
Yeah, I'll do that now.
I'll do that.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.594
Yeah.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.473
Oh!

16:46.539 --> 16:48.074
Aren't you a little young to be
driving a car like this?

16:48.140 --> 16:52.545
Uh, I was born early, so,
I'm a little small for my age.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.648
That's a lovely story you have.
Very compelling.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.586
You got that? You good? Yeah.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.701
Buckle up now.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.703
Thank you.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.207
- Have a great day.
- Whatever.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.108
Please don't call the cops,
please don't call the cops.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.377
Please don't call the cops.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.955
Scottie, what's up, man?

17:36.022 --> 17:39.158
Listen, I'm afraid
I got a criminal to report.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.461
Kid stole a Tesla.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.297
Listen, man. I didn't say
he was bright, okay?

18:17.564 --> 18:19.966
- Sean!
- Hi!

18:21.434 --> 18:22.635
- Hi!
- Oh, my God! You made it.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.237
- Hey! Yeah.
- You made it.

18:25.304 --> 18:28.307
She's real and slightly violent
and I definitely love her.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.676
- Oh my god, you made it!
- Yeah.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.512
I almost had a seizure
when you sent me that text.

18:32.579 --> 18:36.983
I mean, seriously,
you just took your dad's car?

18:37.049 --> 18:38.150
Epitome of epicness, dude.

18:38.217 --> 18:39.285
I guess.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.721
Oh, you have
to tell me everything.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.090
Let's go, and you can go on
with the crazy details.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.025
Okay.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.431
All I have to do is
not mess this up.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.233
Oh, hi.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.301
Uh, can I get
the Santa Cruz Gumbo

18:55.368 --> 18:57.103
with extra bacon please?

18:57.169 --> 18:59.372
Sure, but it'll
cost another buck.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.207
It's totally worth it.

19:01.273 --> 19:04.210
And for you, sir?

19:04.276 --> 19:09.649
Oh, um, does the Santa Cruz
Scramble have what in it?

19:11.418 --> 19:13.486
It comes with toast.

19:13.553 --> 19:17.223
Oh, but the toaster is broken,
so. it'll just be bread.

19:17.289 --> 19:19.258
Uh, okay, cool, well,
I will have that

19:19.325 --> 19:22.261
with no bread and OJ, please.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.631
Anything else? No? Super!

19:27.800 --> 19:29.736
What was that all about,
like, the whole gluten thing?

19:29.802 --> 19:33.973
Uh, nothing,
it's just this crazy thing.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.242
Okay, Mr. Mysterious.

19:36.308 --> 19:38.745
Just can't eat meat and stuff.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.147
You get like
a stomachache or something?

19:41.213 --> 19:44.584
Honestly, it's to keep the alien
in my stomach from growing.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.720
Uh, okay, but
I really do wanna know.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.590
I'll tell you later.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.158
I thought you said
you told me everything.

19:52.224 --> 19:53.359
Well, if I tell you
all my secrets

19:53.426 --> 19:54.727
then what are we
gonna talk about?

19:54.794 --> 19:57.530
Plenty. Like I know
all about your diets.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.832
I am vegan.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.834
I no longer know
what's happening.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.870
I'm just going to laugh a lot,
and hope I can figure it out.

20:03.936 --> 20:07.440
What I mean is that my parents
are vegan, so I'm vegan at home.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.476
But otherwise I eat what I want.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.211
My grandma says it's my parents'
way of, like, dominating

20:12.278 --> 20:13.713
over me because of
their, like, crippling fear

20:13.780 --> 20:15.782
of parental inadequacy.

20:15.848 --> 20:19.018
- Wait, what?
- It's complicated.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.455
She has to like me, right?

20:22.522 --> 20:24.156
I just wish
I was more interesting.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.093
So, I told my friends about you.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.427
I told my friends about you.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.963
Oh, my God, they were so excited
when I told them

20:31.030 --> 20:31.998
that you were coming up.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.332
I mean, not excited as

20:33.399 --> 20:37.403
I was, of course, because
that would be tough to be.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.671
So, how long can
you hang out today?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.172
All day,
we can go crazy and wild

20:40.239 --> 20:41.574
and totally unsupervised.

20:41.641 --> 20:45.444
We can even camp out
at the beach overnight.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.213
What about your parents?

20:47.279 --> 20:49.482
Mm, I don't care about them.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.518
It's funny. He-he.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.962
Hi, there.
Want something to chew?

21:03.029 --> 21:07.433
I'm, I'm sorry.
Um, can I just say something?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.001
Yeah, go for it.

21:09.068 --> 21:12.138
I have never met
a girl like you before.

21:12.204 --> 21:16.042
That's, that's sweet, Sean.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.677
But, I mean,
i-i-it's obvious, right?

21:17.744 --> 21:20.179
Like, I would've never have done
this for anyone else.

21:21.814 --> 21:25.084
But the other girls
are sad though, right?

21:25.151 --> 21:28.387
No. No, Chloe,
there are no other girls.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.157
Like, honestly,
you are all I think about.

21:34.226 --> 21:37.296
- Uh, check, check, please?
- Wait, what just happened?

21:37.363 --> 21:39.732
Uh.

21:42.334 --> 21:45.037
Wait, did I say something?

21:45.104 --> 21:46.673
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?

21:46.739 --> 21:48.775
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's just, you know.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.376
Restaurants make me
like fidgety

21:50.442 --> 21:52.011
'cause it's so small.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.479
Uh, so, we're good?

21:53.546 --> 21:55.214
- Please say we're good.
- We're more than good.

21:55.281 --> 21:56.482
We're great.

21:56.549 --> 21:57.884
Let's go have
our amazing day, okay?

21:57.950 --> 22:00.486
Okay! For a second,
I-I thought you didn't like me.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.955
- I was just like..
- Of course, I like you.

22:07.459 --> 22:08.494
Yeah, I like you too.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.597
I mean..

22:10.663 --> 22:11.864
...when I say I like you

22:11.931 --> 22:16.002
I like you as a friend,
and, like, a buddy.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.937
Oh!

22:20.139 --> 22:23.109
- God, I'm an idiot.
- No, no, you're not an idiot.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.978
It's, it's, I mean,
not that I wouldn't

22:26.045 --> 22:29.215
date you under
totally different circumstances

22:29.281 --> 22:30.950
but I haven't been honest.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.719
Oh, it's just cool,
it's cool, you know.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.153
Is it, is it the gluten thing?

22:34.220 --> 22:36.889
No, why would it be
the gluten thing?

22:36.956 --> 22:39.959
- So, boyfriend maybe like..
- No, no, it's not a boyfriend.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.528
Are you into chicks?
It's okay. Lesbian?

22:42.595 --> 22:43.896
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.598
Sean, can you just listen?

22:45.665 --> 22:47.033
What?

22:47.099 --> 22:50.136
I really thought you might have
figured it out by now.

22:50.202 --> 22:53.505
Figured it out?

22:53.572 --> 22:55.341
We look so much alike.

22:55.407 --> 22:57.944
Like...I could be your sister.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.212
Yeah, except,
I don't have a sister, so.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.983
That you know of.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.918
Right. Because I'm adopted.

23:05.985 --> 23:09.288
But we have the same birthday,
and we're the same age, so?

23:11.357 --> 23:12.925
Exactly.
Do you, do you get it?

23:12.992 --> 23:16.395
- Do you? God!
- I get what?

23:16.462 --> 23:18.765
- Look at me.
- Yeah, um, no, I'm looking.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.000
You are very beautiful.

23:25.437 --> 23:27.807
This is so messed up.

23:27.874 --> 23:31.110
Sean, the reason my parents
put me in therapy

23:31.177 --> 23:34.213
is because they told me
I had a twin brother.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.316
They gave him up
for adoption and kept me.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.786
And my therapist said
that if it bothered me that much

23:39.852 --> 23:42.621
I should go out and find him.

23:42.689 --> 23:45.591
So, I did.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.994
And now you're here
in a stolen car

23:48.060 --> 23:50.797
not eating wheat,
and calling me beautiful?

23:50.863 --> 23:51.831
She's insane.

23:51.898 --> 23:52.865
Really good looking

23:52.932 --> 23:54.266
and totally insane.

23:54.333 --> 23:57.670
You're kidding, right?
I mean, this is funny?

23:58.905 --> 24:02.742
- I wish it was.
- She's serious.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.177
But I've been thinking
about her, when I..

24:05.244 --> 24:07.213
Uh-oh, God.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.748
Sean.

24:14.353 --> 24:16.923
Shit, shit!

24:19.225 --> 24:22.729
I just got catfished,
by my sister.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.841
- Sean!
- Go away!

24:39.445 --> 24:41.413
Sean!

24:44.050 --> 24:46.986
Why wouldn't she just tell me?

24:47.053 --> 24:49.922
What is wrong with her?

24:51.590 --> 24:54.493
I'm a jerk.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.496
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me too.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.999
I'm sorry I ever came up here.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.405
I knew by the time I was three.

25:07.439 --> 25:11.577
I mean, I didn't know

25:11.643 --> 25:13.880
because no one told me

25:13.946 --> 25:16.148
but I knew.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.819
I think there was always
something missing inside

25:19.886 --> 25:23.022
like, an emptiness,
and I had no idea why.

25:26.292 --> 25:29.428
So, I made up
an imaginary friend.

25:31.063 --> 25:34.801
That literally
did everything with me.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.408
Even made my parents set a place
for him at the dinner table.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.346
So, Blue was the person
I would talk

25:47.413 --> 25:51.250
to about everything,
like he could hear.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.886
That was his name.

25:53.953 --> 25:57.756
Blue.
My parents were freaked out.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.227
They told me that
they worried because

26:01.293 --> 26:04.864
Blue was a boy
and, I was so attached.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.466
Sometimes, sometimes..

26:09.168 --> 26:11.938
Sometimes I would even
call him my brother.

26:12.872 --> 26:15.942
Like, I had a total meltdown

26:16.008 --> 26:18.544
when they put my friend
in Blue's seat one night

26:18.610 --> 26:21.147
and that's when they told me.

26:23.883 --> 26:26.819
I mean, it wasn't a lot

26:26.886 --> 26:30.456
but I found out more

26:30.522 --> 26:32.859
because I asked non-stop.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.830
I want you to know

26:37.897 --> 26:40.199
that I hate them

26:40.266 --> 26:42.801
for what they did to you.

26:44.136 --> 26:47.139
They're messed up people.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.341
And I'm not ever going
to forgive them ever.

27:06.692 --> 27:08.827
Sorry I called you pretty.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.432
It's okay.

27:15.902 --> 27:18.037
I mean,
I am kinda, huh?

27:19.538 --> 27:22.008
I don't think I'm
allowed to think that.

27:25.511 --> 27:29.381
Well, I think
you're pretty handsome..

27:30.950 --> 27:32.618
...bro.

27:42.628 --> 27:45.097
How do you know?

27:45.164 --> 27:50.236
I mean, like a 100 percent,
for certain..

27:50.302 --> 27:53.039
...that I'm your brother.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.507
You look exactly like our dad.

27:59.711 --> 28:02.248
That just
sounds strange to hear.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.286
Do you wanna go
have our amazing day?

28:20.933 --> 28:24.336
- Come on.
- Okay.

28:26.238 --> 28:29.275
I guess I have a sister now.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.577
And it doesn't seem
to phase her at all.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.512
She just keeps
telling me stories

28:33.579 --> 28:36.915
and showing me places like
I've known her my whole life.

28:36.983 --> 28:40.352
It feels
pretty awesome actually.

28:48.294 --> 28:51.663
And somehow
this just feels normal.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.665
Maybe that's a twin thing.

28:58.670 --> 29:02.241
Nice. Real nice. Thank you.

29:04.843 --> 29:07.146
You know,
I mean, it's.. Here.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.415
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.250
At least the gluten-free
cones are good.

29:11.317 --> 29:13.019
I mean, if we weren't sure
that we were related

29:13.085 --> 29:14.786
the ice cream
would prove it, so..

29:14.853 --> 29:15.988
Yeah, pistachio is awesome.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.389
Second only to like
macadamia nut

29:17.456 --> 29:20.192
but I'm pretty sure
you can only get that in white.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.829
Oh, look at you,
tropical vacation.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.065
Show off much?

29:26.132 --> 29:27.333
Honestly,
it's not really that fun.

29:27.399 --> 29:28.967
It's a lot of just,
like, hiking around

29:29.035 --> 29:30.936
and listening to my dad
talk about plant life.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.438
Well, you,
you've gotta surf there.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.973
- I mean, do you?
- Oh, I surf.

29:35.041 --> 29:36.575
- Ha ha. Do I surf there?
- Okay, good.

29:36.642 --> 29:38.644
I mean, come on, I'm gonna
go to Hawaii and not surf?

29:38.710 --> 29:39.945
No, the waves are awesome.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.113
They're, like, just perfect

29:41.180 --> 29:43.249
and blue and gorgeous,
it's amazing.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.451
I wanna go to Hawaii so bad.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.420
North Shore! I think I'd die
of happiness if I went there.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.822
- You would die?
- I-I would, I would die.

29:50.889 --> 29:52.224
You wanna go that bad?

29:52.291 --> 29:55.094
It's like item number two
on my bucket list.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.895
Surf North Shore.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.397
Wait, no, meet you.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.232
- Surf North Shore.
- Oh, thank you.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.000
I appreciate that I'm ahead
of the "Surf North Shore."

30:02.068 --> 30:04.903
Yeah, so, that's it,
my list would be done.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.939
My family goes every September.
You should come with us.

30:08.006 --> 30:10.109
'Cause you can surf
with me at North Shore.

30:10.176 --> 30:13.645
- Yeah, that, that would be ra..
- Really, really rad.

30:13.712 --> 30:15.647
You know what else'd
be really rad?

30:15.714 --> 30:16.915
What?

30:16.982 --> 30:18.450
If I got a new shirt.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.587
This one's getting really sticky
and I don't have any others.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.690
- What about this one?
- No.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.092
Why not?

30:27.293 --> 30:29.161
- Yeah, it's cool.
- Yeah?

30:29.228 --> 30:30.729
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Get it.

30:30.796 --> 30:33.265
- What do you think?
- That looks really pricey.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.633
Ah, whatever.
My parents owe me.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.303
There's a second one here,
do you want it?

30:37.369 --> 30:39.538
Unm-unm, I'm okay.

30:39.605 --> 30:42.074
We'll be twins. Do the whole
dressin' up the same thing.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.309
I just don't want
you to get in trouble

30:43.375 --> 30:44.543
for all the money
you're spending.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.044
Ah, my parents
spend on bottles of wine

30:46.112 --> 30:48.147
more expensive than this.
We're good.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.917
Oh, I shouldn't
be surprised, right?

30:51.983 --> 30:54.453
With the car you rolled up in.

30:54.520 --> 30:58.224
- Our second car's a Volvo.
- And the third car?

30:58.290 --> 30:59.791
We don't have
a third car, thanks.

30:59.858 --> 31:04.062
Oh, um, I'm sorry, I mean, I'm
pretty sure you'll get one soon.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.997
Are you mad at me or something?

31:06.064 --> 31:09.935
No! You know, I just, I-I think
the Crawfords sounds super rad.

31:10.001 --> 31:13.305
Like...they're all crazy,
cool government scientists.

31:13.372 --> 31:17.276
They take you on rad vacations.
They drive really cool cars.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.944
You even have
your own credit card. Ugh!

31:19.010 --> 31:21.547
Yeah, but it's not like I go on
shopping sprees all the time.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.349
Well, you know,
maybe you should.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.317
Well, then, they
would me mad at me, yeah.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.187
Just like they get mad at me
for surfing or school

31:28.254 --> 31:30.055
or whatever other excuse
they make up

31:30.122 --> 31:32.958
just to be mad at me over.

31:33.024 --> 31:35.994
They sound as bad as mine.
You know, except more cash.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.396
That doesn't change anything.

31:37.463 --> 31:38.830
They still want me
to be this perfect kid

31:38.897 --> 31:42.067
like, all the time,
which I can't be, even if I..

31:42.134 --> 31:43.269
...if I wanted to be.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.437
Sean, they're better than mine.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.406
Mine are like dictators,
constantly telling me

31:47.473 --> 31:50.476
what to eat,
what to wear, what to think!

31:50.542 --> 31:52.611
You know, I cannot wait
until I turn 18

31:52.678 --> 31:56.114
because I would rather be
home alone with a credit card

31:56.182 --> 31:58.184
than eat another
stupid tasteless

31:58.250 --> 31:59.818
piece of tofu in my life.

31:59.885 --> 32:04.223
Yeah, 'cause being abandoned
by your parents feels great.

32:06.124 --> 32:09.228
I'm getting these.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.132
It would be so much
easier to just go home

32:14.200 --> 32:16.768
and forget
this ever happened.

32:16.835 --> 32:19.905
But, I can't
leave her like this.

32:19.971 --> 32:22.140
Are you mad at me?

32:26.878 --> 32:28.447
No.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.751
No, I'm mad at your parents.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.886
Our parents.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.824
Yeah.
Yeah, those people.

32:38.890 --> 32:42.228
Look, I get it.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.830
I'm mad at them
almost every day.

32:48.066 --> 32:52.003
They're so self-righteous
about everything.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.473
Especially food.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.175
I don't get how they
can go off judging someone

32:57.243 --> 32:59.110
after what they did to us.

32:59.177 --> 33:01.547
What they did to you.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.489
Why do you think
they gave me up?

33:13.725 --> 33:16.728
Is it ever gonna
feel simple, though?

33:21.066 --> 33:22.801
No, I guess not.

33:27.205 --> 33:29.174
You sound surprised
that your teenage boy

33:29.241 --> 33:31.176
likes videogames
more than a piano.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.644
I just, I just have not been

33:32.711 --> 33:35.213
able to get out of
panic mode with him.

33:35.281 --> 33:37.449
You know, with everything
that happened at the hospital.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.618
- Well, he's okay now.
- Yeah.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.488
- And that's all because of you.
- Mm-hmm.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.190
Well, that was the plan, right?

33:45.257 --> 33:46.792
But I think that
we should text him

33:46.858 --> 33:50.462
and just let him know where
the spare key is so that

33:50.529 --> 33:52.998
we can let him surf,
'cause I shoulda let him go

33:53.064 --> 33:56.802
with his friends and I didn't,
and...now he hates me.

33:57.903 --> 33:59.905
Excuse me, one second.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.641
Hello?

34:02.708 --> 34:06.044
Yes, this is Robert Crawford.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.646
Ah, yes, sir.

34:11.617 --> 34:13.452
Umm..

34:15.521 --> 34:17.656
Thank you, officer.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.993
What was that?

34:22.060 --> 34:24.429
That was the police.

34:24.496 --> 34:27.032
The Tesla was
spotted up in Big Sur.

34:27.098 --> 34:30.302
Well, that can't be right,
I mean.. Right?

34:31.969 --> 34:33.972
Unfortunately, it is.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.610
Robert, don't show that to me.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.446
Unless you're
absolutely certain.

34:40.512 --> 34:43.214
The police department
gave a perfect description

34:43.281 --> 34:45.183
of the boy driving the car.
It's Sean.

34:45.250 --> 34:49.254
He wouldn't do that. He doesn't
even have a driver's permit.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.922
I mean, clearly,
he's managed well enough.

34:50.989 --> 34:52.424
The car is there.

34:52.491 --> 34:55.293
Well, you know, I think that
if we just call the police

34:55.360 --> 34:58.597
and let them know where he is,
and what location he's at

34:58.664 --> 35:01.767
then we can pick him up tonight.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.569
- I'm gonna call him.
- No, no, no, no, no.

35:03.635 --> 35:04.936
I don't want him
to hear the worry in your voice.

35:05.003 --> 35:06.738
- I'll call him.
- What are you gonna say?

35:06.805 --> 35:10.308
I'm, well, we-we'll pretend
that we don't know that

35:10.376 --> 35:11.610
he's left the house,
and then we'll go up

35:11.677 --> 35:13.545
and we'll get him.
Is that okay?

35:13.612 --> 35:17.349
If he's up there, that's okay.

35:24.723 --> 35:26.658
- Hey, dad.
- Uh, listen.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.561
Your-your mother and I,
we, uh, we feel bad

35:29.628 --> 35:31.229
about what happened yesterday.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.798
No, I-I mean, it's okay.

35:32.864 --> 35:36.001
We, we'd like
to make it up to you.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.268
Wow!

35:37.335 --> 35:40.305
Look there's a,
there's a little compartment

35:40.372 --> 35:42.774
in the Tesla just
next to the steering wheel

35:42.841 --> 35:45.210
on the left hand side,
there's a, there's a spare key

35:45.276 --> 35:48.414
to the storage unit there.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.783
- And mom was okay with this?
- 'No, no, it was her idea.'

35:51.850 --> 35:54.420
Ah, your, your mother
sends her love.

35:54.486 --> 35:57.889
Okay. Uh, tell her,
I love her back.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.891
Bye, son.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.564
He's definitely with the car.

36:05.631 --> 36:08.800
I'm just...wondering
what he's gonna eat.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.770
Yeah, well, we got
bigger problems than that.

36:13.371 --> 36:16.307
Totally guilty
and totally clueless.

36:16.374 --> 36:19.177
- Weird.
- Does he know?

36:19.244 --> 36:20.979
I think they're drunk.

36:21.046 --> 36:22.581
Let's go surf.

36:27.318 --> 36:30.856
- What are you thinking?
- Ah, just stuff.

36:33.391 --> 36:35.193
Oh, my God! Come on.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.596
We haven't established
the mind meld yet, so..

36:37.663 --> 36:40.131
you're gonna have to share.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.767
I was just thinkin' that

36:41.833 --> 36:45.336
it's crazy that I can
even be up here.

36:45.403 --> 36:47.773
I know, it's nuts.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.875
- It's a long drive.
- No.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.443
No, I mean..

36:51.510 --> 36:54.613
I used to be super sick
when I was little.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.916
I was in pain all the time.

36:57.983 --> 37:01.086
I wouldn't be able
to do any of this.

37:01.152 --> 37:04.255
Not drive or surf or..

37:04.322 --> 37:06.758
...really walk very far.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.594
Oh, wow.

37:08.660 --> 37:12.898
- Well, but you're fine now.
- Yeah.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.000
Yeah, pretty much.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.636
I mean, that's why
I can't eat gluten, but..

37:17.703 --> 37:20.606
Well, I'm just
glad you're better.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.808
It's not your fault.

37:25.443 --> 37:28.146
What?

37:28.213 --> 37:30.115
Just a little tired.

37:30.181 --> 37:31.950
You wanna take these back then?

37:34.720 --> 37:37.122
For sure, bruh.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.934
Look at him catch that one.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.203
Hmm. Amateur.

37:54.806 --> 37:58.343
- What?
- I need a shower.

37:58.409 --> 38:01.046
Wait for it, wait for it.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.514
Ta-da!

38:02.581 --> 38:05.617
No. I'll shower at my house.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.719
Okay, well,
do you wanna go there

38:07.786 --> 38:09.821
and then come back
and meet me here?

38:09.888 --> 38:11.957
Or, you can come with.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.459
I mean, were you
planning on being homeless?

38:14.526 --> 38:16.562
Uh, I just hadn't
really thought about it.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.664
I was gonna drive back
at some point.

38:18.730 --> 38:21.499
Okay, so, here's the plan.

38:21.567 --> 38:24.169
You come to my house,
you take a shower

38:24.235 --> 38:27.639
we grab dinner, and can
figure out whatever later.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.040
Isn't that a little weird?

38:29.107 --> 38:31.610
Kind of, but they're
not home, remember?

38:31.677 --> 38:33.745
And I know you're curious.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.815
Yeah, a little bit.

38:36.882 --> 38:39.985
Great, you can finally see
where the vile vegans live.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.787
I mean, we'll be gone
before they get home.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.589
- You promise?
- Swear.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.892
Now, where's that
fancy car of yours?

39:15.253 --> 39:18.790
And this is officially
the worst idea I've ever had.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.822
Yeah, definitely
don't want to be here.

39:50.889 --> 39:54.225
Sorry, we're, we were
just, uh, cleaning here.

39:54.292 --> 39:55.994
Couldn't tell.

39:58.429 --> 40:01.499
- Can I take a shower?
- Yeah, but there's only..

40:01.566 --> 40:04.803
There's only one bathroom.
So, you're gonna have to wait.

40:04.870 --> 40:08.039
Be out here,
waiting impatiently.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.341
Oh, and don't worry
about breaking anything.

40:10.408 --> 40:13.144
No one will notice.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.020
This is where
my real parents live.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.529
They're messy.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.665
But, it's laidback in here.

40:43.008 --> 40:46.845
My mom would never
leave a table like this.

41:03.294 --> 41:07.332
This is their room.
It's tiny.

41:08.366 --> 41:10.568
Are-are they poor?

41:10.635 --> 41:14.372
Uh, I guess that's what
Chloe was talking about.

41:14.439 --> 41:17.108
I think they're Buddhists.

41:17.175 --> 41:20.311
Oh, good.
They wear normal clothes.

41:23.681 --> 41:25.116
What's this book about?

41:25.183 --> 41:27.853
Um, never mind.
Those people are naked.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.790
Oh, God! I need out.

41:58.049 --> 42:04.155
- Your turn.
- Oh, um, I.. I think I'm good.

42:04.222 --> 42:06.324
The house isn't gonna eat you.

42:06.391 --> 42:09.194
Yeah, yeah, no, I'd just
rather keep it short.

42:09.260 --> 42:12.197
Well, you can't leave
before I show you the forest.

42:13.731 --> 42:17.435
- The whole forest?
- Uh, just a quick tour.

42:17.502 --> 42:19.838
I promise.

42:23.408 --> 42:27.345
So many promises,
so little leaving.

43:03.214 --> 43:05.150
Oh, my God!

43:06.952 --> 43:09.855
Are you okay?

43:09.921 --> 43:12.991
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

43:13.058 --> 43:17.795
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.
- They're everywhere.

43:17.863 --> 43:19.330
Rock jumped out of nowhere.

43:27.105 --> 43:30.375
Why does she keep stalling?

43:37.348 --> 43:40.585
We should go back
to the house. Come on.

43:41.586 --> 43:42.954
Yeah.

44:04.842 --> 44:06.577
She looks upset..

44:06.644 --> 44:10.148
...which means
she wants me to stay.

44:10.215 --> 44:11.917
Maybe I'll just say,
I'm going to the bathroom

44:11.983 --> 44:14.019
and I'll drive away, instead.

44:14.085 --> 44:15.887
Yeah, good plan.

44:15.954 --> 44:17.855
Hey.

44:17.923 --> 44:22.027
Are we gonna take off soon?

44:22.093 --> 44:25.496
Figured you weren't gonna
be impressed with this place.

44:25.563 --> 44:27.632
That's not what I meant.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.802
I guess, I wanted
to show you that

44:31.869 --> 44:35.040
you're weren't
missing out on much.

44:35.106 --> 44:37.308
It's not so bad.

44:40.946 --> 44:43.481
I mean, we can go if you want.

44:43.548 --> 44:45.083
Sure.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.221
What's this?

44:52.123 --> 44:56.727
Christmas.
A few years back.

44:56.794 --> 44:58.829
From our granddad.

44:58.896 --> 45:00.865
Oh.

45:00.932 --> 45:04.102
Sorry, that sucks.

45:04.169 --> 45:06.371
She would've liked you.

45:09.007 --> 45:12.177
- Did she ever talk about me?
- Uh, once.

45:12.243 --> 45:15.280
Um, she said something to mom

45:15.346 --> 45:18.116
and there was a lot
of crying and yelling.

45:20.018 --> 45:22.887
I guess that
went over well, then.

45:22.954 --> 45:24.922
It was a lot of drama.

45:26.958 --> 45:30.828
Guess that's why
no one talks to us.

45:30.895 --> 45:34.299
You mean, like other family?

45:34.365 --> 45:36.801
Yeah, just,
we're kind of alone up here

45:36.867 --> 45:39.637
like dad's parents died
a while ago

45:39.704 --> 45:43.074
and mom's parents are
kinda hard to be around, so..

45:43.141 --> 45:45.743
There's not anyone to talk to.

45:45.810 --> 45:47.178
And what about your parents?

45:47.245 --> 45:50.681
They can be cool, like,
most mornings we go surfing

45:50.748 --> 45:52.717
before school and..

45:52.783 --> 45:55.253
Do you actually
make it to school on time?

45:55.320 --> 46:00.225
Not usually. Mom thinks
schedules are for fascists, so.

46:01.726 --> 46:03.694
I bet that's awesome.

46:21.279 --> 46:24.849
You know,
it's not so bad, actually.

46:24.915 --> 46:29.954
Yeah, it's...decent.

46:30.021 --> 46:32.223
Uh, like..

46:34.192 --> 46:36.694
We leave a spot for you
at the dinner table.

46:36.761 --> 46:37.895
I mean, we don't call it that

46:37.962 --> 46:41.232
but...that's your spot.

46:41.299 --> 46:43.668
I think I just need to commit
to the terrible decisions

46:43.734 --> 46:46.071
I'm making today.
Go all in.

46:46.137 --> 46:47.605
It may be my last chance before

46:47.672 --> 46:49.874
my other parents
kill me anyway.

46:49.940 --> 46:52.443
What if I met them?

46:52.510 --> 46:55.780
- Like, in the future?
- No, like-like tonight.

46:55.846 --> 46:57.582
When they came back.

46:57.648 --> 46:59.584
Your thing is broken.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.519
What, the phone
or the tracker?

47:01.586 --> 47:03.354
No, I'm not getting
an exact location.

47:03.421 --> 47:05.290
- Let me see it.
- Well, there's nothing to fix.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.958
Well, we're gonna be there
in a couple of hours.

47:08.025 --> 47:09.627
Well, it's gonna be dark
by the time we get there.

47:09.694 --> 47:11.829
We're gonna have to
look for him in the morning.

47:11.896 --> 47:13.331
At least we know he's there.

47:13.398 --> 47:16.701
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

47:16.767 --> 47:18.269
Look!

47:21.739 --> 47:25.876
- 'I hate her already.'
- What's her name?

47:25.943 --> 47:28.113
Chloe Morgan.

47:29.380 --> 47:31.482
Robert, he's in love.

47:31.549 --> 47:33.351
Or, something.

47:33.418 --> 47:36.221
Well, let's just say
it's love for my sake, okay?

47:36.287 --> 47:40.291
Sweetheart, love, that's just a,
it's a strong word.

47:40.358 --> 47:43.261
You worried your little
boy's growing up?

47:53.971 --> 47:54.972
Oh, God.

47:55.039 --> 47:56.040
Why did I think

47:56.107 --> 47:58.176
this would be a good idea?

47:58.243 --> 47:59.977
She made me do it, I..

48:00.044 --> 48:01.512
Want some?

48:01.579 --> 48:03.414
Oh, no, I-I don't
like wine.

48:03.481 --> 48:06.417
It grows on you, trust me.

48:08.286 --> 48:10.221
Well, thank you, for doing this.

48:10.288 --> 48:13.724
Yeah, don't thank me yet.

48:17.195 --> 48:18.663
Okay.

48:26.003 --> 48:28.273
Oh, God.
My parents.

48:28.339 --> 48:30.741
My real parents.

48:43.020 --> 48:46.891
Chloe! Is your friend here?

48:46.957 --> 48:51.462
They're here,
and they look totally boring.

48:51.529 --> 48:53.531
Maybe if I pass out,
I can back out of this.

48:53.598 --> 48:56.434
Yeah, Chlo,
what's up with that car?

48:57.768 --> 48:59.170
- Chloe?
- Sorry.

48:59.237 --> 49:04.041
Oh. There's, uh,
there's a thing here so..

49:04.108 --> 49:07.545
We're just gonna go, uh, put our
junk down and be right back.

49:11.782 --> 49:17.488
My God! They think
you're my boyfriend.

49:17.555 --> 49:19.924
Maybe this is a bad idea.

49:19.990 --> 49:21.359
Well, we're in it now.

49:21.426 --> 49:23.961
So, you wanna pretend?

49:24.028 --> 49:26.030
No.

49:26.096 --> 49:29.234
No, no, let's not pretend.
Let's just, let's..

49:29.300 --> 49:30.868
You tell them.

49:30.935 --> 49:32.870
Just give me a signal.

49:33.938 --> 49:36.073
Okay.

49:36.140 --> 49:38.643
- The car, it's there.
- Yeah.

49:38.709 --> 49:41.446
Hi, I'm Paula Lorelei Morgan,
nice to meet you.

49:41.512 --> 49:44.282
- Hey.
- Hello, Mrs. Morgan.

49:44.349 --> 49:47.252
- Honey--
- Henry. And you are?

49:47.318 --> 49:49.186
- Uh, this is, uh--
- Sean.

49:49.254 --> 49:52.390
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Awesome to meet you, Sean.

49:52.457 --> 49:53.691
You two go to school together?

49:53.758 --> 49:57.362
Um, why don't we sit down,
um, uh..

49:57.428 --> 49:58.829
- I'm a little queasy.
- Yeah.

49:58.896 --> 50:01.466
Queasy? Oh, you feel sick?
You nervous, honey?

50:01.532 --> 50:05.670
- That's great, that's great.
- No idea.

50:05.736 --> 50:09.073
I think you...just look
so radiant when you're nervous.

50:09.139 --> 50:13.210
Radiant! She's rad..
She looks radiant.

50:13.278 --> 50:17.315
So, uh, how did you two hook up?

50:17.382 --> 50:21.352
Um, we met on a, um,
surf, online surf thing

50:21.419 --> 50:23.354
where you post photos
of the best spots.

50:23.421 --> 50:25.890
Okay. Yeah, so you're local?

50:25.956 --> 50:28.759
- Yes.
- No!

50:28.826 --> 50:30.361
I mean, normally
he doesn't live here.

50:30.428 --> 50:32.029
His parents have
a vacation house up here.

50:32.096 --> 50:34.932
And they come up,
so, we decided to hang out.

50:34.999 --> 50:36.601
Hmm.

50:36.667 --> 50:39.804
But you guys are more than,
you're-you're dating?

50:41.439 --> 50:44.842
Um, sort of. Not really.

50:44.909 --> 50:47.478
'Uh, how do you
feel about it, Sean?'

50:49.280 --> 50:54.218
Uh, it's pretty casual, because,
you know, we live so far apart.

50:54.285 --> 50:58.923
Uh, and, uh, how long have
you two been, um, casually--

50:58.989 --> 51:01.692
Uh, we, it's only been
like Facetime and text.

51:01.759 --> 51:02.993
Don't make it sound criminal.

51:03.060 --> 51:06.397
- I'm just doin' my job.
- And, um..

51:06.464 --> 51:07.965
How old did you
say you were, Sean?

51:08.032 --> 51:11.702
- Fif.. Um, 17.
- Oh, not 18?

51:11.769 --> 51:15.172
No, no, no, I-I barely
look my age anyway.

51:15.239 --> 51:18.443
- And the car?
- My dad's.

51:18.509 --> 51:20.210
And where did you
say you're from, Sean?

51:20.277 --> 51:21.979
Isn't, um..

51:22.046 --> 51:23.080
Isn't Sean handsome, mom?

51:23.147 --> 51:25.015
Kinda reminds me
a little of dad.

51:25.082 --> 51:28.052
Dad? I don't know about that.

51:28.118 --> 51:32.723
Hmm.. Okay, maybe,
if you squint one eye.

51:32.790 --> 51:35.426
Oh, maybe no.

51:35.493 --> 51:37.762
Well, there's a name
for that, isn't it?

51:37.828 --> 51:40.264
- Ah, Freudian.
- Freudian, yes!

51:40.331 --> 51:43.033
Sean is my Freudian brot..
boyfriend.

51:44.935 --> 51:47.805
- Okay, Chloe.
- Wait, what?

51:47.872 --> 51:49.774
It's when you're attracted
to your dad or your brother.

51:49.840 --> 51:53.344
- Ah, Chloe, aah, okay.
- She does that sometimes.

51:53.411 --> 51:54.879
- Got it.
- Do what?

51:54.945 --> 51:59.249
I'm delightful. Oh, and you
haven't heard the best part yet.

51:59.316 --> 52:02.286
Umm, lay it on me.

52:02.353 --> 52:05.356
Sean is adopted!

52:05.423 --> 52:07.692
- Chloe?
- Yeah.

52:07.758 --> 52:09.760
What are you doing, Chloe?

52:09.827 --> 52:12.262
Well, how do you feel
about adoption, dad?

52:12.329 --> 52:13.798
- That's just fine.
- Just fine.

52:13.864 --> 52:16.467
What about you, do you
think adoption is just fine?

52:16.534 --> 52:17.968
You do not have to answer that.

52:18.035 --> 52:19.870
Chloe, that is
extremely rude of you

52:19.937 --> 52:22.239
to put Sean in a spot
like that. That's very unfair.

52:22.306 --> 52:23.908
Oh, you know, mom,
I totally agree with you

52:23.974 --> 52:25.342
on the whole fairness thing,
but Sean's life

52:25.410 --> 52:26.511
is a little short on that.

52:26.577 --> 52:28.278
- Wouldn't you say?
- I guess.

52:28.345 --> 52:31.382
And I was telling him that,
I used to have a brother

52:31.449 --> 52:32.683
that was given up for adoption

52:32.750 --> 52:35.486
and he'd probably
look a lot like him.

52:35.553 --> 52:37.021
How's that for Freudian?

52:37.087 --> 52:38.889
Okay, that's,
that's quite enough, Chloe.

52:38.956 --> 52:40.124
Sean, I apologize.

52:40.190 --> 52:42.059
We should really get back
to something else.

52:42.126 --> 52:43.628
How about this lovely meal

52:43.694 --> 52:45.362
you've prepared for us, Chloe?

52:45.430 --> 52:47.064
But he came all
the way to hear why?

52:47.131 --> 52:48.433
To hear what?

52:48.499 --> 52:51.536
Why you gave him up
for adoption?

52:51.602 --> 52:53.538
- I think I should go.
- What you talkin' about, Chloe?

52:53.604 --> 52:55.039
You want me to
go with you, Sean?

52:55.105 --> 52:57.374
No one is going anywhere.

52:57.442 --> 53:00.945
Sean, honey, um...this isn't..

53:05.115 --> 53:07.084
This isn't a joke for us.

53:07.151 --> 53:08.986
You understand, so..

53:11.221 --> 53:13.157
'Is there something
you'd like to say?'

53:13.223 --> 53:15.392
So, what do you say
to your real mom

53:15.460 --> 53:17.762
when you kind of hate her

53:17.828 --> 53:21.165
but also kind of
want her to love you?

53:22.600 --> 53:24.835
I'm your son.

53:34.945 --> 53:36.714
Ahh..

53:38.348 --> 53:40.918
I think that's our son there.

53:53.564 --> 53:57.001
I'm so sorry.

53:57.067 --> 53:59.804
I'm so sorry, Sean.

54:02.006 --> 54:04.041
Don't, like, hug him to death.

54:04.108 --> 54:07.778
Aah, my little boy.

54:07.845 --> 54:09.914
- I'm the one who found him.
- Mm-hmm.

54:09.980 --> 54:12.416
I know that, Chloe.

54:12.483 --> 54:16.320
Can we just, can we just
get back to the food, please?

54:18.388 --> 54:21.058
God!

54:33.270 --> 54:36.206
Thank you.

54:36.273 --> 54:38.208
You're just so handsome.

54:40.410 --> 54:42.479
Like dad!

54:42.547 --> 54:45.282
I guess I see it now.

54:45.349 --> 54:47.084
My little mini me.

54:47.151 --> 54:48.919
Don't say it like that,
that's weird.

54:48.986 --> 54:50.988
It's true.

54:52.523 --> 54:55.092
I mean, I, I don't
really see it.

54:55.159 --> 54:56.727
You told me I look like him,
but I don't--

54:56.794 --> 54:58.529
He looks like granddad.

54:58.596 --> 55:00.264
It is true.

55:00.330 --> 55:02.867
I just..

55:02.933 --> 55:05.202
I don't understand
how you're here.

55:05.269 --> 55:08.338
Ah, why don't we talk about
how this all came about?

55:08.405 --> 55:10.074
Chloe found me on Facebook.

55:10.140 --> 55:13.911
But, Chloe baby,
how did you know his name?

55:13.978 --> 55:17.214
I don't know, I just
spent a lot of time looking.

55:17.281 --> 55:20.384
So, Dr. Grayson didn't
have anything to do with this?

55:20.450 --> 55:22.653
All she said was that
the parents that adopted him

55:22.720 --> 55:23.954
lived in San Clemente.

55:24.021 --> 55:25.923
- Crap, Chloe!
- What?

55:25.990 --> 55:27.992
She didn't think
I'd actually find him.

55:28.058 --> 55:31.896
And so what? I could look
by birthday on Facebook.

55:31.962 --> 55:35.199
She knew that I was gonna spend
my entire life looking for him.

55:36.667 --> 55:37.968
She wanted me to heal

55:38.035 --> 55:39.770
which is apparently
not what you want.

55:39.837 --> 55:41.572
That is not the case,
we want that.

55:41.639 --> 55:44.341
But this, this doesn't
make any sense.

55:44.408 --> 55:47.177
How do you know that.. How
do you know that Sean is Sean?

55:47.244 --> 55:50.648
I'm not nuts! I told
Dr. Grayson his parent's name.

55:50.715 --> 55:53.984
That still doesn't
explain the Tesla.

55:54.051 --> 55:55.519
Oh, do you wanna tell them?

55:55.586 --> 55:57.287
I mean, you got
one set of parents mad

55:57.354 --> 55:59.023
might as well make two.

55:59.089 --> 56:01.391
Whoa, whoa.
What is, what is happening?

56:01.458 --> 56:04.294
Is everything alright, Sean?

56:04.361 --> 56:07.064
Yeah, just..

56:08.465 --> 56:13.003
I kind of borrowed
my dad's car to get here.

56:13.070 --> 56:16.240
Okay, and he knows
about it, right?

56:16.306 --> 56:19.176
Look, I'm sorry, I just
needed to get out of there.

56:19.243 --> 56:21.011
I know this is weird.

56:21.078 --> 56:23.714
I can leave after dinner,
um, just fine.

56:23.781 --> 56:25.616
You-you should
crash here tonight.

56:25.683 --> 56:27.284
And we'd both feel a lot better

56:27.351 --> 56:29.654
if you let your
parents know you're safe.

56:29.720 --> 56:31.388
'Absolutely.'

56:31.455 --> 56:35.559
I mean, do they, do they
even know you're up here?

56:35.626 --> 56:37.762
They don't even know
I have a sister.

56:37.828 --> 56:41.365
Right. Right, well..

56:41.431 --> 56:46.470
Maybe just for now, don't
um, don't mention that part.

56:46.536 --> 56:48.806
It might upset them.

56:48.873 --> 56:50.641
- What about me?
- You have had a glass.

56:50.708 --> 56:51.909
That is your limit.

56:51.976 --> 56:54.945
- Sean hasn't had a glass.
- Stop.

56:55.012 --> 56:56.781
Sean's parents may
have different views

56:56.847 --> 56:57.948
about this type of thing.

56:58.015 --> 57:00.851
Actually, you're his parents.

57:04.521 --> 57:06.791
Goodnight.

57:06.857 --> 57:09.559
It's okay,
I-I don't drink wine.

57:09.626 --> 57:11.495
Yeah, I mean,
I didn't even realize

57:11.561 --> 57:14.865
that I have a sister
until today.

57:14.932 --> 57:18.302
Chloe does stuff like this,
and I get it.

57:18.368 --> 57:20.070
I-it's our fault.

57:21.972 --> 57:24.975
She's really upset at us
for letting you go.

57:28.679 --> 57:31.415
Will you tell me why?

57:31.481 --> 57:34.852
- Of course.
- Yeah.

57:47.497 --> 57:50.367
Okay.

57:51.702 --> 57:53.203
This is it.

57:53.270 --> 57:55.339
This is where they tell me
why they hate me.

57:55.405 --> 57:56.573
So I'm 34

57:56.640 --> 58:02.246
and your father is 35.

58:02.312 --> 58:06.951
Which means we were 19 and 20
when I got pregnant.

58:07.017 --> 58:09.286
We were here in Santa Cruz

58:09.353 --> 58:12.156
about to start our
second year in college and..

58:14.725 --> 58:17.394
We weren't prepared
for a lot of things.

58:18.996 --> 58:23.633
Your grandparents were all very
conservative and our friends

58:23.700 --> 58:27.037
they said we shouldn't,
but we wanted to keep you.

58:29.306 --> 58:31.408
Keep me?

58:31.475 --> 58:33.610
Our friends were telling us
to get an abortion

58:33.677 --> 58:39.817
but...that's not who we are.

58:41.185 --> 58:42.386
Well..

58:42.452 --> 58:45.122
So, we..

58:45.189 --> 58:47.858
went out and bought a crib

58:47.925 --> 58:52.396
and baby clothes,
and little shoes

58:52.462 --> 58:54.932
and we were so excited.

58:54.999 --> 58:57.734
We were so excited
that you were coming.

58:57.802 --> 59:01.038
But, that was before we knew
that you were twins.

59:01.105 --> 59:05.742
So, at a certain point Chloe
was growing faster than you

59:05.810 --> 59:08.612
and sort of crowding you out.

59:08.678 --> 59:11.115
You weren't developing properly.

59:11.181 --> 59:15.052
So, we decided
to have a procedure

59:15.119 --> 59:17.487
where you were both born early

59:17.554 --> 59:22.092
and...the doctors didn't
think you were gonna live.

59:22.159 --> 59:24.061
So, um..

59:28.933 --> 59:32.569
I remember you were so tiny.

59:32.636 --> 59:34.939
Not even two pounds.

59:38.642 --> 59:42.479
I remember the doctors
putting you in this glass box

59:42.546 --> 59:47.952
with tubes coming out
everywhere. And, um..

59:49.086 --> 59:54.058
Uh, tsk, then they..

59:54.124 --> 59:55.492
started tellin' us

59:55.559 --> 59:59.763
about all these
surgeries that you'd need

59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.866
and about how you'd be on pills
for the rest of your life.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:04.734
How your gut didn't develop.

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:07.872
They didn't know if anything
would be able fix it.

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.008
And..

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:13.844
Sean, we wanted nothing more..

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:16.280
...than to help you.

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:20.050
And all that stuff
you would need

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.319
was way more than
we could afford.

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:30.027
Uh, then a social worker
came in

01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:32.930
and said that
there are these couples.

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:35.399
They could take a preemie.

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.501
They had money and time.

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:40.570
We knew right away that that was
the best option for you.

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:44.774
I was so scared that
we were gonna ruin your life

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:47.444
or, or that you'd die

01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:49.346
because we couldn't..

01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:53.150
...you know, get you
the treatment that you needed.

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:54.885
So, we looked
at some couples

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:58.322
and picked a pair of scientists.

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:04.128
And that, they were older
and really wanted kids

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:06.596
and they could give you
the treatment you needed.

01:01:08.032 --> 01:01:09.666
Plus, I always thought
that maybe some day

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:12.069
they could find a way
to make you better.

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:17.774
You have no idea

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:21.278
what it means to me, to Paula..

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:23.780
...to see you healthy.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.182
And..

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:28.618
...tss, looking awesome.

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:32.056
You are a miracle.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.459
But you guys wanted to keep me.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.061
Absolutely.

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:41.999
Yeah.

01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:50.467
I wonder what my friends
are doing right now.

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:52.702
I bet it's less weird
than this.

01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:57.774
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.109
Hey.

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:03.313
How are you doing?

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:05.649
Fine.

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:09.119
That was kind of
an avalanche, huh?

01:03:10.054 --> 01:03:11.388
Yeah.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:13.290
Yeah, you can say that again.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.761
You know, but it, it was good.

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:20.030
I, uh, I wanted to meet them.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:21.698
So..

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:24.701
I'm sorry for what I said
about our parents.

01:03:24.768 --> 01:03:27.071
They're not actually that bad.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.706
No worries.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.776
Do you like them?

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:36.046
Yeah.

01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:39.749
Yeah, they're-they're cool.

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:44.121
They are.

01:03:44.188 --> 01:03:46.223
But, they were kind of

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.925
on their best behavior tonight.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.760
They're usually
a pain in my ass.

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:52.762
Well, I mean, I think

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.632
most parents can be
a pain in the ass.

01:03:55.699 --> 01:03:58.034
I know my parents
certainly can be.

01:03:58.102 --> 01:04:00.204
I hate it when you say that.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:03.140
Your parents are my parents.

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:06.543
Those people are,
I don't know..

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:08.212
...something.

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:10.280
Yeah, but..

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:13.583
Chloe, those people
were all I knew.

01:04:15.719 --> 01:04:17.754
They took care of me.

01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:20.990
I know.

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:22.559
I'm sorry.

01:04:24.128 --> 01:04:26.563
Are you okay?

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.365
No, not really.

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.067
Sorry.

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:35.605
This is all my fault.

01:04:35.672 --> 01:04:38.074
Actually,
all this is my fault.

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:41.278
Everything.

01:04:42.679 --> 01:04:46.316
I mean, I-I don't really
see how that's possible.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:48.585
They didn't tell you?

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:50.154
Tell me what?

01:04:52.256 --> 01:04:54.324
The reason you're sick.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:55.592
I mean, the reason I was sick

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:57.494
was 'cause
I didn't develop properly.

01:04:57.561 --> 01:04:58.762
I mean, that-that sort of stuff

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:01.631
just happens with twins.

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:03.600
Yeah, but..

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.369
...that was me.

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:10.374
I was this giant, evil baby
crushing you..

01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:13.210
...not letting you grow.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.681
They barely saved your life.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.284
Chloe, I don't think
you did it on purpose.

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:23.287
You weren't an evil baby.

01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:25.855
If I hadn't..

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.791
...none of this
would've happened..

01:05:29.193 --> 01:05:31.395
...we would've been
a normal family.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:34.698
I don't know about normal.

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:40.837
You'd be happy.

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:45.775
You know, we can't undo it.

01:05:45.842 --> 01:05:47.177
So..

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:51.481
You could live with us.

01:05:51.548 --> 01:05:54.551
We could share a room
and, we could surf.

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.222
Seriously.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:01.191
Move up here.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:05.795
Is it-is it even doable? I..

01:06:05.862 --> 01:06:07.764
Sure it is, I mean..

01:06:07.831 --> 01:06:10.600
I could tell that
they love you and..

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:12.302
...I love you.

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:14.404
You're my own brother.

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:18.174
I love you too, sis.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.411
Chloe.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.947
Oh, my God, okay, uh..

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:28.518
You're the best.
You know that, right?

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:31.755
I can't wait till
you're up here for good.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:32.956
Goodnight.

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:35.659
Goodnight.

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:38.628
Wait. How did she interpret
that as a yes?

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:48.305
Drives eight hours
and sleeps in a parking lot.

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:50.907
I'm not assuming anything.

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:55.579
Where're his parents?

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:57.847
Probably out looking for him.

01:06:57.914 --> 01:06:59.849
Well, clearly not hard enough.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.320
I'm just saying
it's a crap situation.

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:08.425
I mean, we should call CPS.

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:11.261
What?

01:07:11.328 --> 01:07:13.196
- For Sean's sake.
- That's ridiculous.

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:15.365
They've obviously
put a lot of time and money

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:16.933
into making him better.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.803
Doesn't sound like
bad parenting to me.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.571
Yeah, well,
just because you're rich

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:23.773
doesn't mean
you're good people.

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:26.843
How do I rewind?

01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:31.748
I just wanna go home.

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:16.960
Robert, it's him.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:20.997
He says he's gonna
see us tomorrow.

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:22.131
And?

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:25.001
And he hopes that
we're having fun.

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:28.904
Is he on drugs?

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.875
We're gonna find him.

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.978
We're gonna find him.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.582
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:42.919
Vegan pancakes, can't fake that.

01:08:42.986 --> 01:08:43.953
Not hungry?

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.054
I'm starving because

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.423
they may be weed pancakes.

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:48.256
I'm tired,
because I didn't sleep

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:49.626
and I have no idea

01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:51.428
how I'm gonna get home
before my parents.

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:53.596
Oh, yeah,
and I still need to leave

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.399
without having
Chloe go nuts.

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:56.600
Ah, not really.

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:57.701
Maybe it's the drive home?

01:08:57.767 --> 01:08:59.803
Maybe it's the shitty breakfast.

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:01.505
Thank you.

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:03.106
Yeah.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.576
Are you sure
you're alright to drive down?

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.444
Yeah. I'm good.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:10.013
Well, Henry and I
can drive down with you

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:11.848
and one of us can fly back.

01:09:11.915 --> 01:09:15.785
Um, so, taking the one down
is a good plan.

01:09:15.852 --> 01:09:17.987
And, uh, it's,
it's that one there.

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:20.023
Well, we'll stock you up
with a lots of munchies--

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:23.091
Or one of us can just go
with you, it's no problem.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:25.361
Really, it's okay.
I mean, everything.

01:09:25.429 --> 01:09:28.564
I don't want you to have to
run into my other parents.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:31.167
- It would be weird.
- Um..

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:33.301
Look, it's-it's fine, Sean.

01:09:33.368 --> 01:09:35.604
If-if you're scared
to go home..

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:39.175
Clearly, this is a,
this is a big deal.

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:40.577
I mean, are you..

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:42.178
Are you afraid
of what your dad's gonna do

01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:44.313
when you get home?

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:48.151
Well, yeah. I mean, if he
finds out, he's gonna flip.

01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:50.819
So will my mom, but..

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:53.156
Okay. Um..

01:09:53.221 --> 01:09:54.924
Sean, honey..

01:09:57.026 --> 01:10:00.564
- Does your dad beat you?
- What?

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.499
It's okay to talk to us,
we're safe.

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:05.469
Whatever, whatever
he said to you..

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.504
...we can take care of you.

01:10:07.571 --> 01:10:09.338
We can take care of you.

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:11.575
You can tell us,
we are safe for you.

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.109
I mean, he, he pushed me once--

01:10:13.176 --> 01:10:14.811
- I-I told you.
- Oh, my God.

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:17.313
Oh, you-you are more than
welcome to stay here

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.682
for as long as you want,
we are..

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:20.216
- Totally.
- We're so happy to do that.

01:10:20.283 --> 01:10:22.318
They're never gonna
let me leave now.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:24.053
I'm gonna have to be vegan.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.321
I can't do this.

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.056
We can take care of you.

01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:29.459
We'll figure something out,
for as long as you need.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.995
Totally.

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:35.632
I'll grab it.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.167
Okay, thank you.

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:39.536
Is that your mother again?

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:44.641
- Hi.
- Chloe, good morning.

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:45.675
Is Sean here?

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:47.010
Uh, how do you know my name?

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.211
Facebook.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.046
Figures. Uh, Sean?

01:10:50.113 --> 01:10:51.114
No.

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:55.251
I think that's his parents.

01:10:55.318 --> 01:10:57.220
- Oh, uh..
- Are you okay?

01:10:57.286 --> 01:10:59.589
I never thought I'd say this,
but thank God

01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:01.424
that Val Moreth is here.

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:02.659
I just have to get out of here

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:04.060
before anyone finds out
the truth.

01:11:04.127 --> 01:11:05.629
And we'll be okay.

01:11:05.695 --> 01:11:07.864
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- What's going on?

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:10.399
- What're you doing here?
- Excuse me.

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.268
- No, I haven't.
- What did you eat?

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:13.336
Did you check the ingredients?

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:14.671
Who is this?

01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:16.139
- The da.. Wait, the other dad.
- It's him.

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.675
Sean, Sean..
Are they stressing you out?

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:19.976
- Um..
- Excuse me?

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:21.511
- Hi, excuse me, yeah.
- We should go.

01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:22.779
Okay, well, you two listen,
we all know

01:11:22.846 --> 01:11:23.980
happy boys
don't run away from home.

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:25.749
I-I don't know
who you people are

01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:28.217
but that's a steep assumption.
Let's go, Sean.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:31.087
Okay, uh, uh he's only gonna
go if he wants to go.

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:33.022
And that's exactly
what he just said.

01:11:33.089 --> 01:11:35.124
It's not like
you gave him any option.

01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:36.359
Um..

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:37.794
You don't have
the right to tell me

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:39.596
what happens to my son.

01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:41.464
Uh, okay, he's my son too.

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:43.099
- On what planet?
- Planet Earth.

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:45.835
- We are his birth parents.
- Yep.

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:48.004
- Yeah.
- I need a drink.

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.506
I'm so sorry, I lied to Sean
to get him up here.

01:11:50.574 --> 01:11:51.541
Look, I don't care
why he's here.

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:52.809
Is-is-is that true?

01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:54.544
I mean, are, are you
related to these people?

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:56.713
I didn't know it
on the drive up.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.047
I-I didn't-I didn't even know
that Chloe

01:11:58.114 --> 01:11:59.749
was my twin sister,
but yes.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:02.151
Like I said, totally my fault.

01:12:02.218 --> 01:12:04.888
You have a twin? You have
a twin, did you know that..

01:12:04.954 --> 01:12:07.691
Sweetheart,
I-I did not know that.

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:09.258
Well, things didn't
really go as planned.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:11.928
- I, I didn't know.
- What're you saying?

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.229
Sean, what're you saying?

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:15.198
He's saying he wants to stay.

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:16.700
No, I-I did not say that.

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:18.635
You said that,
and-and Paula said that.

01:12:18.702 --> 01:12:19.703
I never said that.

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:22.171
She's not Paula.
She's your mom.

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:24.808
We-we talked about this
last night, Sean.

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:27.310
- Are you guys smoking pot?
- Excuse me?

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:28.477
Yeah, 'cause it smells of pot.

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:31.781
We love him,
and we want him to stay.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.116
He shouldn't have left
in the first place.

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.684
Chloe, enough.
You're not helping.

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:36.820
No, shut up, mom.
You're not helping.

01:12:36.886 --> 01:12:39.155
All of you don't care
what me and Sean want.

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:41.157
We want to be together.

01:12:41.224 --> 01:12:44.227
I just really wanna hear it
from you, little fish.

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.031
Do you wanna stay?

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:51.768
Is that why you came?

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.907
It's complicated, mom, I mean..

01:12:57.974 --> 01:13:00.176
Everything changed
this weekend.

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:11.855
Mom? Mom?
Just lay down here.

01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:13.389
Did you know
anything about this?

01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:14.858
Put your legs up.

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:16.292
Do you need something?

01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:18.394
Another kick in the gut,
that's what I need.

01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:21.330
Uh, okay. I have, uh,
St. John's wort to calm her

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.332
or chamomile..

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:27.136
Hey, do you guys want some pot
or something?

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:28.805
You know what,
that doesn't surprise me.

01:13:28.872 --> 01:13:30.840
Whatever, dad.
I found your joint in the car.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:32.742
What? Did you smoke it?

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.177
I can't find it,
I don't, I'm--

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:35.645
Can-can I get some water,
please?

01:13:35.712 --> 01:13:37.113
- Yeah, Chloe, please.
- Thank you.

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.348
- That was unbelievable.
- Or the chamomile.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:40.950
No kidding, man. No kidding.

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:42.518
- Mom, where are the cups?
- The cup, it's where..

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.153
Top shelf.

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:48.124
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

01:13:48.191 --> 01:13:49.859
I didn't know this was gonna
end up like this.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.429
No, I am being hysterical.
I apologize.

01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:55.699
- It's not even funny, mom.
- Did you put him up to this?

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.066
No, I didn't ask him
to steal the car

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:59.135
but when he had it,
I was all, "Why not?"

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:01.070
Maybe because
it's completely irrational.

01:14:01.137 --> 01:14:02.305
Look, I knew that
you were never gonna

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:03.339
let us see each other.

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:04.540
It was worth the risk.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:05.842
God, why would you think that?

01:14:05.909 --> 01:14:07.811
Because you keep him in a cage.
You both do.

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:09.779
You never let him do
anything fun, ever.

01:14:09.846 --> 01:14:11.114
- Chloe--
- Okay, okay. Take it easy.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.016
Fantastic,
I'm getting parenting lessons

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:14.383
from a couple of hippies
and their daughter.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:16.753
Uh, maybe you should be
thanking us

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.387
for taking care of Sean

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:19.856
instead of getting aggressive.

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:22.025
Listen, I'm happy
that my son is alive and well

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:25.161
but that's right about
where my gratitude ends.

01:14:25.228 --> 01:14:27.831
Maybe, uh, the kids
should go outside

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:30.734
for a minute, so that
we can talk, the adults.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.970
- The kids need to stay.
- The kids need to stay.

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:37.140
I would prefer if they were here

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.108
because maybe some of us
would act a little more civil.

01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:40.977
That's right, keep an eye on me

01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:43.412
because I might use some words
you're not familiar with.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.447
- Ooh.
- Wow, wow.

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:45.481
I just don't think that

01:14:45.548 --> 01:14:47.283
right now is the time to be

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:48.985
unpacking all of this.

01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:51.520
I mean, it's no mystery
that Sean's in crisis.

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:54.057
Oh, are you saying
that you can read his mind?

01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:56.092
Well, please tell me,
because I would love to know

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:58.661
what we've done
that is so atrocious.

01:14:58.728 --> 01:15:01.097
You're suffocating him.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:03.632
Did he actually
tell you that or..

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:05.301
It's clear as day, lady.

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:07.636
Uh, no, I'm Lisa,
and this is Robert.

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:10.573
And from what I can tell,
there is no parenting going on

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:12.842
in this household whatsoever.

01:15:12.909 --> 01:15:14.811
For Paula and Henry

01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:17.113
we respect
Chloe's ideas and needs.

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.447
And the two of you
don't even know

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:20.016
that Sean is confused
about his future.

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:21.818
Well, of course, he's confused,
his frontal lobe

01:15:21.885 --> 01:15:23.853
isn't even developed
fully to process

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.154
the consequences of his actions

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:26.389
which is why
we need to keep him

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.091
on track
despite those limitations.

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:29.926
There are those big words
you were talking about.

01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:32.195
So, you're saying Sean doesn't
know what's best for him?

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.097
No teenager knows
what's best for them

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:35.664
and th-tha-tha-that's why
parents are here

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:39.568
so that we can prevent you from
making irreversible mistakes.

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.504
Oh, you mean
an irreversible mistake

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:43.106
that gave you both a son?

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:44.340
You guys were the ones
that were talking about

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:45.741
having an abortion.

01:15:45.809 --> 01:15:47.310
- Okay, that was never the plan.
- I'm sorry!

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.846
What did you tell him, that you
were thinking of aborting him?

01:15:49.913 --> 01:15:52.215
Jesus Christ! What..

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:54.050
They were just trying to explain
to me why they gave me up.

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:55.284
Well, maybe
they shouldn't have told you

01:15:55.351 --> 01:15:57.053
that they were thinking
about killing you.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.421
They might not have been planned

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.156
but we never ever thought
about abortion.

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:02.491
Well, then why bring it up?

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:03.827
It's your lucky day, Sean.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:06.029
We didn't kill you,
we just, mm..

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:07.463
...abandoned you
and kept your sister.

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:08.932
You've no idea
what you're talking about.

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:10.499
That's not how it happened.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.035
Please stop, just go.

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:13.336
Let me just go back, okay?

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:14.770
Hey, you're right.
You should just go.

01:16:14.838 --> 01:16:16.172
Sean can decide for himself.

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:17.106
Yeah, except

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:18.341
the adults make the decisions

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:19.175
in my house, okay?

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:20.476
And if you try to stop me

01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:21.510
I will call my attorney first

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:22.946
and then the police.

01:16:23.012 --> 01:16:24.948
Oh, no, we are going
to call the police on you.

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:27.216
You manipulative asshole,
you push Sean around

01:16:27.283 --> 01:16:28.451
and now you're gonna
try the same shit with us--

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:29.953
Excuse me, have you stopped

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:32.088
for a second to think
that, you know, considering

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:33.823
the-the-the medical attention

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:35.458
the private schools,
me giving him

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.893
basically everything
he's ever wanted.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.961
The one thing that he can't get

01:16:38.027 --> 01:16:38.995
out of his head is the fact

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:40.029
that the two people who were

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:41.464
supposed to love him the most

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:42.899
abandoned him.

01:16:42.966 --> 01:16:44.200
- Get back in your Tesla.
- That is not fair.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:45.768
- And get out of house.
- That is fair.

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:47.536
You don't deserve Sean,
neither one of you.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:50.306
- Get out!
- Any time now.

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:51.674
What?

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.176
You little bitch!

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:54.710
You think that you can just
do whatever you want

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:56.545
because, what, you didn't learn
how to be a grown up?

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:59.048
Okay, you know what,
do not talk to her like that.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:01.317
You have no idea
what it was like losing Sean.

01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:03.619
And what was it like,
losing Sean, exactly?

01:17:03.686 --> 01:17:04.921
Did you just happen to trip

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:06.522
and accidently put him up
for adoption.

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:09.325
I mean, the delusion in this
household is just monumental.

01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:11.394
Guys, calm down, you guys
are acting too crazy!

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.729
Chloe, this is your fault,
you brought him here.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:14.998
We all know why
teenage boys make

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:16.799
these kinds of trips,
don't we, Rob?

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:18.601
Stop acting
like you can't hear him!

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:19.702
Don't interrupt, Chloe!

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:21.304
You-you just interrupted her!

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:22.972
Alright, will you just listen?

01:17:23.039 --> 01:17:24.908
- Little fish..
- No, don't call me little!

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:26.375
Alright? I'm not little!

01:17:26.442 --> 01:17:28.644
You j-j-jus-just need to listen
to each other for a sec

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:31.114
instead of screaming and yelling
and saying these awful things!

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.848
We are listening,
they're the ones saying

01:17:32.916 --> 01:17:34.117
terrible things, Sean.

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:35.451
- There. Tha-that. Right there.
- What?

01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:37.186
- Is what I'm talking about.
- What?

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:39.788
You are just
embarrassing yourself. Stop!

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:42.158
You're right,
I am embarrassed

01:17:42.225 --> 01:17:44.860
that my daughter lies to me,
and then she lured you up here

01:17:44.928 --> 01:17:46.662
promising I don't know what.

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:48.397
And then she hates us for doing

01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:49.933
what we thought
was best for you.

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:51.400
And you know what, we did..

01:17:51.467 --> 01:17:53.036
We did what we thought
we had to do

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:54.203
because we didn't think
there was

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:55.671
any other way to help you.

01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:57.140
But you're okay now, right.

01:17:57.206 --> 01:17:58.942
- It's just, he's okay.
- You're right.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:01.110
- I am okay.
- Right?

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:03.913
Okay, I'm okay
because of my parents.

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:06.015
My real parents.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.285
They have loved me

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:11.554
and taken care of me.
They've been great parents.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.390
They have been my parents,
because you..

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:16.459
Because you were too young
an-an-and too poor

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:19.996
and too whatever
to take care of me.

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:21.430
Okay, and that's okay, I get it.

01:18:21.497 --> 01:18:22.498
I forgive you.

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:25.134
You know what, I-I-I'm glad

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:26.469
this whole thing worked out
the way I did

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.571
because I'm okay..

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:30.439
...and I wasn't before.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:33.109
God, is life perfect now?

01:18:33.176 --> 01:18:34.877
For everybody, it's okay.

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:37.413
Really, because I am okay.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:40.349
And honestly, if I would have to
do this whole thing over again

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:42.818
I would do it
the exact same way.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:47.156
This time I would choose
to have Chloe in my life.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:48.958
Because she didn't,
she didn't choose any of this

01:18:49.025 --> 01:18:50.526
just like me.

01:18:53.162 --> 01:18:55.164
Look...taking the car

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:57.100
and running away was stupid.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:59.635
It was a dumb idea.
Really, it was.

01:18:59.702 --> 01:19:01.770
But it was for the better..

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:03.572
...because I know her now.

01:19:03.639 --> 01:19:05.274
And I didn't fu..

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:08.911
I'm-I'm gonna keep
talkin' to her.

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:10.980
Okay, and I want to be able
to keep seeing her

01:19:11.047 --> 01:19:14.350
and honestly, I don't care what
you guys have to say about that

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:15.618
or you guys...

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:17.820
because all of you
have been making decisions

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.722
for us for too long.

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:22.691
Stupid decisions, bad decisions.

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:28.097
And I'm done.
I want this decision.

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:31.200
I want my sister.

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:33.669
If that's what you want,
Sean, then..

01:19:33.736 --> 01:19:36.605
...we are-are fine with that.

01:19:36.672 --> 01:19:37.740
Us too.

01:19:38.641 --> 01:19:39.608
Yeah.

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:44.547
Listen..

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.487
- Hmm.
- Thank you, guys.

01:19:52.855 --> 01:19:54.490
Thank you for telling me.

01:19:54.557 --> 01:19:57.093
I wanted to know.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.562
And it's okay. I-I forgive you.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:02.565
I just want us to be okay.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:04.933
Yeah.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.502
We're just..

01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:09.738
We're so glad
we got to meet you finally.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.340
- And, umm..
- Yeah.

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:14.310
Well, maybe you'll-you'll wanna
get to know us a little better.

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:18.514
Yeah, man.
Our door is always open.

01:20:18.581 --> 01:20:19.682
Thank you.

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:21.417
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:22.751
Thank you.

01:20:31.694 --> 01:20:33.028
I'm..

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:36.965
I'm sorry
I put you through this, mom.

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:38.501
I'm sorry
I put you through this.

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:41.237
But thank you for coming, okay.

01:20:41.304 --> 01:20:43.339
Thank you both for coming.

01:20:43.406 --> 01:20:45.541
We're just glad to see you, son.

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:50.313
Can we just go home, please?

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:52.448
No, no, wa-wai-wait, wait.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.617
Not until everyone apologizes.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:55.718
Chloe, that's fine.

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:58.454
No. No, it's not fine.

01:20:58.521 --> 01:21:00.323
We are family now,
and I'm not gonna let

01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:02.658
some stupid fight change that.

01:21:20.176 --> 01:21:22.645
I am sorry for my words.

01:21:25.114 --> 01:21:26.081
Thank you.

01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:27.616
I should have thanked you

01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:29.218
for healing him.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:34.757
Thank you.

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:39.195
- Uh, okay.
- Umm..

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:46.535
Parents!

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:50.473
Hey.

01:21:50.539 --> 01:21:52.908
Thank you.

01:21:52.975 --> 01:21:54.277
For what?

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:56.412
Not hating me.

01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:58.281
That'd be kinda impossible.

01:22:00.183 --> 01:22:02.117
I don't know.

01:22:02.185 --> 01:22:04.253
I caused a lot of drama,
didn't I?

01:22:05.188 --> 01:22:06.855
Yeah, you did.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.024
It was worth it.

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:10.659
Do you really have to go?

01:22:12.228 --> 01:22:13.229
Hold on.

01:22:13.296 --> 01:22:14.463
- Hey, mom?
- Yeah.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:15.298
Dad?

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:17.666
Is there any chance that maybe

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:21.304
Chloe could come with us
to Hawaii this year?

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:23.939
Well, if her parents agree..

01:22:24.006 --> 01:22:25.508
...yeah.

01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:28.177
Hmm, we'd have to pay her way.

01:22:28.244 --> 01:22:30.846
Umm, I think we can do that,
son.

01:22:32.348 --> 01:22:34.683
See? Now, we can surf
the North Shore together.

01:22:35.418 --> 01:22:37.186
- Oh.
- Hmm.

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:40.723
I think I'm gonna like
having you as a brother.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.292
Hey.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:46.862
I'll see ya.

01:22:55.271 --> 01:22:59.442
So, I take it
I'm grounded forever?

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:02.411
Well, apparently
that doesn't work anymore.

01:23:04.247 --> 01:23:05.648
You okay?

01:23:06.682 --> 01:23:09.785
Not entirely,
but that's my own fault.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.689
Um, I don't understand.

01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:16.892
I thought that
I could show you how to be..

01:23:18.261 --> 01:23:20.028
...but that's not fair, is it?

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:22.331
You've got to find your own way.

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:26.902
I'm sorry that I treated you
like a little boy.

01:23:30.373 --> 01:23:31.374
You know...

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.075
..your hippy-dippy birth parents

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:35.611
they actually have a point.

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:39.047
You should have a choice
in what you do with your time.

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:40.783
But don't get too excited,
we're not gonna go

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:42.485
'full blown-out Chloe here'

01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:46.255
but, but I feel like we can
adjust your schedule.

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:49.325
Does that mean I can skip piano?

01:23:49.392 --> 01:23:50.926
We could..

01:23:50.993 --> 01:23:53.529
...take out the things
that you don't enjoy.

01:23:53.596 --> 01:23:55.764
Except the shelter.

01:23:55.831 --> 01:23:58.066
We're gonna have to sub
in other things

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.568
'but you can choose those two.'

01:23:59.635 --> 01:24:01.804
So, can I have some free time..

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.406
...to waste?

01:24:03.472 --> 01:24:06.241
As long as you don't ditch,
to surf.

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:10.913
Thanks, mom.
You're the best.

01:24:12.648 --> 01:24:14.450
I'm never admitting
this out loud

01:24:14.517 --> 01:24:18.120
but it's good
to be wrong sometimes.

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:19.788
I was wrong about Chloe.

01:24:19.855 --> 01:24:23.959
She's a tsunami, inside
a tornado, inside a hurricane..

01:24:24.026 --> 01:24:25.661
...but I love her anyway.

01:24:25.728 --> 01:24:28.897
And I'm glad
she pulled me into her chaos.

01:24:30.366 --> 01:24:33.569
I guess life is pretty good.

01:24:33.636 --> 01:24:35.904
I'm just happy
I survived this weekend.

01:24:35.971 --> 01:24:39.342
And mostly that my friends
weren't around to see it.
