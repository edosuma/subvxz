- Oh.

- You have a kitchen in your hotel room.
- Yeah, right? Wild, huh?

26:59.800 --> 27:01.006
Unbelievable. What's this?

27:01.120 --> 27:04.090
Uh, probably the finest bottle
of Scotch ever made.

27:04.200 --> 27:07.124
Uh, guys, finest bottle of Scotch
ever made. You want a shot?

- JOHNNY: Yes!
- Gypsy, you want a shot of Scotch?

No, no, no.
Gary, you can't do shots of that stuff.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.643
- Why not?
- Because it's like an antique.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.411
- You can't just gulp it down.
- It's antique alcohol.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.841
- It's, like, 1,000 bucks a bottle.
- Oh, wow.

27:18.960 --> 27:23.010
I mean, I'm very thirsty, so, you know,
you're the host of the party and...

27:23.160 --> 27:25.640
- Very funny.
- I'm just kidding around. It's a joke.

- No, we're not.

- Give him a happy birthday.
- Give me a couple of minutes to change.

- OK, this is a birthday present.

- What do you mean by freebie?

you don't wanna do shots of Scotch, OK?

- Use a coaster? You sound like my mom.

you just think about stuff like that.

all right?

32:47.840 --> 32:49.922
Can't they just break in or something?

32:50.040 --> 32:52.520
Gimme a break, Gary.
They can't break in the house.

Just hang out.

Watch TV or something
but, hey, don't touch the minibar.

33:02.120 --> 33:05.727
OK? Because I already ate,
like, a $10 box of Twizzlers.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.729
You know what?
You're being a very bad host.

out these gutters while we're here.

Fix that mailbox.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.927
And what's with all the trash
in the driveway?

33:28.640 --> 33:32.440
Maybe you should just clean it up
and not say anything, Walt.

Is that him?

33:36.240 --> 33:37.241
Yep.

- Hey, Walt.
- Perry.

All right,
I'm just gonna let you in, and...

33:55.480 --> 33:57.448
- Oh, hey, let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.005
You bet.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.009
I only got a second.
I gotta get back to work.

- (EXHALES)
- Back to work.

34:03.960 --> 34:07.328

marks on the table like this.

Oh, yeah, I tell Salome all the time
but she doesn't always get it.

34:13.440 --> 34:16.409
You know, I've been thinking.

34:17.120 --> 34:22.081
Maybe I should take a crack
at that playhouse out there.

34:22.880 --> 34:25.167
- What do you mean?
- Just spruce it up a little.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.487
Make it look like an actual house.

34:28.239 --> 34:30.208
Never mind.
Maybe I shouldn't say anything.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.091
- What are you talking about, Walt?
- Nothing!

34:33.199 --> 34:35.806
- Forget it.
- You promised.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.605
(SIGHS) Oh, you're right, Joanie.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.330
(BOTH WHISPER)

34:40.920 --> 34:42.251
So, please, try to be nice.

34:42.360 --> 34:43.850
OK?

34:45.239 --> 34:46.810
WALT: I-I don't mean to be critical,

34:46.960 --> 34:50.646
but, you know,
your effort is just kind of...

34:51.639 --> 34:52.641
...lacking.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.650
- JOAN: Walt!
- I think Salome likes the house.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.491
He just means
you didn't put your heart into it.

34:58.600 --> 35:02.525
But that's OK. Not everyone is good
at putting their heart into things.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.961
I'm sorry
I'm not a professional wood person.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.689
I know. We can work on it together.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.605
- You wanna help me?
- That's a great idea.

It's Scotch and tomato juice.

- Gary, I had a kid.
- Mm-hm.

We were having a baby, man.
We had to take a break.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.207
- It was just a hiatus.
- It was a hiatus?

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.527
- Yeah.
- Gimme a break.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.608

You remember that? 30 cities.

for us. It was all lined up.

about what that could have led to?

into the band.

and I thought it was a good idea.

I mean maybe a little bit, you know,

It was a brief phone call.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.450
He said he would discuss it with you.
I didn't know he would do it today.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.688
I thought he would wait
until after your birthday.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:03.850
Well, he did it today, on my birthday.

I'm not even mad. I don't know. I mean...

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.203
I guess I did kinda flip out,
and I feel bad about that.

- What?

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.922

kind of mid-life crisis or something.

We had that conversation.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.327
Yes, because originally it was, but
then they had to move it back a night,

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.966
because there's a PTA thing
at the school tomorrow night.
