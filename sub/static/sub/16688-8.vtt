WEBVTT

00:09.760 --> 00:12.780
Oh, what a beautiful day!

00:12.880 --> 00:15.340
Don't you agree, Mr. Rabbit?

00:15.440 --> 00:17.620
Aw, definitely, Pops!

00:17.720 --> 00:19.020
Enjoy your walk!

00:19.120 --> 00:20.940
( Humming )

00:21.040 --> 00:22.660
( Gasps )

00:22.760 --> 00:24.580
Huh?

00:24.680 --> 00:25.940
( Pitter! Patter! Pitter! )

00:26.040 --> 00:28.620
What?
( Whimpers ) Aah!

00:28.720 --> 00:30.720
( Breathing heavily )

00:33.320 --> 00:35.320
( Warble! )

00:37.240 --> 00:38.300
Oh!

00:38.400 --> 00:40.400
( Thunder crashes )

00:42.600 --> 00:44.660
Excuse me,
but do you have a minute

00:44.760 --> 00:47.620
to fill out this form
with your name and address?

00:47.720 --> 00:49.720
( Screams )

00:50.640 --> 00:51.700
( Both gasp )

00:51.800 --> 00:54.100
Not again!
( Grunts )

00:54.200 --> 00:55.460
Pops!
Wake up!

00:55.560 --> 00:57.540
( Gasps )

00:57.640 --> 00:59.060
What's going on?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.160
You were levitating stuff
in your sleep.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.140
I was?

01:02.240 --> 01:03.940
Yeah, like that time
in the observatory?

01:08.280 --> 01:11.460
Oh, my, I don't remember
doing that at all.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.700
Well, what do you remember
about your dream?

01:13.800 --> 01:15.580
I was an awful nightmare.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.140
There was this
wretched creature.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.500
He wanted to know
where I live.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.100
Oh, it was terrible.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.340
I can't have
that dream again!

01:24.440 --> 01:25.860
Don't worry, Pops.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.960
We'll make sure you don't have
any more nightmares.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.460
What are we doing
back at the dome?

01:31.560 --> 01:34.340
We got two words for you,
Pops ââ carâtoons.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.340
Ooh, I like this idea.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.460
Yeah, we're gonna watch
this old cartoon ââ

01:38.560 --> 01:40.260
"Funky Wunky
and the Groovy Gang."

01:40.360 --> 01:43.080
The only nightmares you might
get is from the bad animation.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.900
We did it, groovies!

01:47.000 --> 01:50.820
We found out that the ghost
of Blumont Cove is...

01:50.920 --> 01:52.220
( All gasp )

01:52.320 --> 01:54.320
All: Ole' crotchety Elmer,
the Lighthouse Keeper!

01:54.200 --> 01:56.780
That's right!
There's gold in these waters,

01:56.880 --> 01:59.580
and I would've made millions if
it weren't for you groovy kids!

01:59.680 --> 02:01.260
It's "roovy rang!"

02:01.360 --> 02:02.580
All: Oh, Wunky!

02:02.680 --> 02:03.740
( Laughter )

02:03.840 --> 02:06.020
And, like,
we couldn't have done it

02:06.120 --> 02:08.460
without the help of
the '76 starting lineup

02:08.560 --> 02:10.220
of the Oklahoma
Mud Pigeons.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.940
Don't mention it, Alfie.
Hey, Wunky, go long!

02:13.040 --> 02:14.660
Ri got it!
( Bonk! )

02:14.760 --> 02:16.780
All: Oh, Wunky!
( Laughter )

02:16.880 --> 02:19.500
( Laughs )
That was delightful.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.820
I don't think
the animation's bad at all.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.340
Now let's get you to bed.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.300
Oh, Wunky.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.140
( Sighs )

02:31.640 --> 02:33.180
Hmm?
What's this?

02:33.280 --> 02:35.020
Don't you remember,
Chad?

02:35.120 --> 02:38.060
We just found out that the ghost
of Blumont Cove

02:38.160 --> 02:39.700
is ole' crotchety Elmer.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.060
That's right,

02:41.160 --> 02:43.120
and I would've made millions
if you groovy kids

02:43.200 --> 02:45.300
would fill out these forms
with your address.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.660
Wait a minute.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.180
Form? Address?

02:48.280 --> 02:50.640
You're not ole' crotchety Elmer!

02:52.760 --> 02:55.340
( All gasp )

02:55.440 --> 02:59.780
You know, you're really not
making this easy for me.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.980
Come on, man!
Just tell me where you live!

03:03.080 --> 03:04.260
No!

03:04.360 --> 03:05.580
( Gasps )

03:05.680 --> 03:06.900
( All grunt )

03:07.000 --> 03:08.540
( Sighs )
Not again.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.620
Benson's turn.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.620
Do you know who helps to keep
me safe in my dreams?

03:13.720 --> 03:14.780
Who?

03:14.880 --> 03:16.420
Dr. Sweet dreams.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.220
My name is Dr. Sweet Dreams

03:19.320 --> 03:22.340
And sleep is my expertise

03:22.440 --> 03:24.300
No one is immune

03:24.400 --> 03:26.700
To my sweet tunes

03:26.800 --> 03:28.820
Not your sister

03:28.920 --> 03:30.860
Not your pets

03:30.960 --> 03:33.580
Little babies

03:33.680 --> 03:35.900
I'll cure your sleep apnea

03:36.000 --> 03:38.260
Your insomnia

03:38.360 --> 03:41.940
And even your nightmares

03:42.040 --> 03:44.500
You'll sleep peacefully
tonight

03:44.600 --> 03:47.180
To the sound
of my sweet pipes

03:47.280 --> 03:50.600
Buy my tape, don't delay

03:51.200 --> 03:55.060
Okay, just let Dr. Sweet Dreams
do all the work.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.260
Shh.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.500
Oh, thank ââ

03:58.600 --> 04:00.380
( Snores )

04:03.160 --> 04:05.160
Oh, this is fun.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.940
You're the man
from the tape.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.580
That's right

04:14.680 --> 04:16.700
It's me

04:16.800 --> 04:20.580
Are you going to protect me from
that terrible nightmare man?

04:20.680 --> 04:22.780
Oh, yeah!

04:22.880 --> 04:24.220
Thank you.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.180
No need to thank me

04:26.280 --> 04:28.260
It's just part of my job

04:28.360 --> 04:29.860
Yeah!

04:29.960 --> 04:34.380
So, um, like,
are you on earth

04:34.480 --> 04:37.660
Or somewhere else, maybe?

04:37.760 --> 04:39.900
That's an odd question.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.740
I'm just trying
to make small talk

04:42.840 --> 04:44.260
Oh.

04:44.360 --> 04:48.140
So, that was
a "no" to Earth?

04:48.240 --> 04:50.660
Wait a minute,
Dr. Sweet Dreams

04:50.760 --> 04:53.380
would never ask me
a question like that.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.900
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.700
( Grumbles )

04:58.800 --> 05:00.940
I've tried to play nice,

05:01.040 --> 05:04.700
but you're gonna tell me
where you live now!

05:04.800 --> 05:06.420
No!

05:06.520 --> 05:09.540
( All grunt, groan )

05:09.640 --> 05:12.020
Got to think ahead, guys!
Got to think ahead.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.940
( Sighs ) I don't know how
to stop your nightmares, Pops.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.580
Yeah, we tried
two whole things.

05:16.680 --> 05:20.020
I'm so sorry you all
got wrapped up in this.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.700
( Sighs )

05:21.800 --> 05:23.740
Whoa!
You guys are looking rough.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.020
What's going on?

05:25.120 --> 05:27.980
It's these terrible
nightmares I'm having.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.220
This creature keeps coming
to me in my dreams

05:31.320 --> 05:33.660
and demanding to know
where I live.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.500
Hmm.
Sounds like a nightmare alien.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.500
A nightmare alien?

05:38.600 --> 05:40.260
Yeah!
A nightmare alien!

05:40.360 --> 05:42.780
A nightmare alien?!

05:42.880 --> 05:45.220
Yep! That's what it is,
a nightmare alien.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.020
What is
a nightmare alien?

05:47.120 --> 05:49.740
It's a being that can invade
your mind while you sleep.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.340
The only way I know to get rid
of a nightmare alien

05:52.440 --> 05:55.340
is to face it head on in a dream
and show it you're not afraid.

05:55.440 --> 05:59.060
But that's the one thing
I am ââ afraid.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.100
Very, very afraid.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.540
Maybe you don't have
to do this alone.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.980
I learned a technique
in the '60s

06:06.080 --> 06:08.780
that can link
subconscious minds together.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.200
All right.
Everybody sit in a circle.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.660
Now join hands.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.620
All: Ahh!

06:24.720 --> 06:26.980
All right.
Now fall asleep.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.980
I don't mean to undermine
your methods, but...

06:30.080 --> 06:32.940
How are we supposed
to fall asleep like this?

06:33.040 --> 06:35.740
Here, drink this.
It's chamomile tea.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.500
It'll put you right out.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.740
( Slurps ) Seriously Skips,
hot leaf water?

06:39.840 --> 06:41.260
That's all you got?

06:41.360 --> 06:44.380
( Slurps ) Maybe we could
try like a...

06:44.480 --> 06:47.140
like a noise machine.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.060
( Slurps ) Or some...

06:49.160 --> 06:50.860
( Yawns )

06:50.960 --> 06:52.940
orchestral music.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.220
What was that, guys?

06:54.320 --> 06:55.900
You'll have to speak up.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.900
( All snoring )

06:59.000 --> 07:01.160
That's what I thought.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.620
( Thunder crashes )

07:04.720 --> 07:06.220
( Laughs )

07:06.320 --> 07:08.260
No!
Skips: Leave him alone!

07:08.360 --> 07:10.580
Yeah, stop giving him
nightmares.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.700
Aah!

07:11.800 --> 07:13.580
( Breathing heavily )

07:13.680 --> 07:14.980
( Whimpers )

07:15.080 --> 07:17.260
Whoa!
Yah! Aah!

07:17.360 --> 07:18.740
( Zap! )

07:18.840 --> 07:20.740
( Grunts ) Huh?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.220
What's going on
in there?

07:22.320 --> 07:24.500
They're fighting
a nightmare alien.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.060
Oh, yeah,
been there, man.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.460
( Both yelling )

07:27.560 --> 07:29.380
( Both grunt )
( Zap! )

07:29.480 --> 07:30.900
( Yells )

07:31.000 --> 07:32.340
Hyah!
( Zap! )

07:32.440 --> 07:34.440
( Grunting )

07:36.520 --> 07:38.520
( Whimpering )

07:38.880 --> 07:40.340
Ohh!
Skips!

07:40.440 --> 07:42.440
Can you send us back
to the dream world?

07:42.040 --> 07:43.260
No can do.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.020
We're all out of chamomile.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.540
Pops, I didn't want it
to come to this.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.380
But now you're going
to tell me where you live.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.700
No.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.620
Don't listen to him, Pops!
I can take him.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.540
Ack! Aah!

07:55.640 --> 07:57.140
Rigby!

07:57.240 --> 07:58.620
( Grunts )
( Zap! )

07:58.720 --> 08:00.420
( Gasps )

08:00.520 --> 08:02.060
âDid you save him?
âNo!

08:02.160 --> 08:04.160
All right, everybody,
we've got to wake him up.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.060
( All clamoring )

08:05.160 --> 08:06.660
âCome on!
âWake up!

08:06.760 --> 08:08.760
Mordecai: Wake up, Pops!
Come on, you got to wake up!

08:08.320 --> 08:09.860
( Clamoring continues )

08:09.960 --> 08:12.420
Hear that?
They're trying to wake you up.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.520
Maybe you should just
tell me where you are

08:14.400 --> 08:16.680
so I don't have to come back
here next time you fall asleep.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.260
( Laughs )

08:18.360 --> 08:20.420
( Warble! )

08:20.520 --> 08:22.980
Oh, no, not again!
Hurry! Wake him up!

08:23.080 --> 08:24.980
Wake up, Pops!
Let's go!

08:25.080 --> 08:27.300
Your friends aren't here
anymore, Pops.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.380
You must be pretty afraid.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.140
Give in to you fear!

08:31.240 --> 08:33.740
Tell me where you live!

08:33.840 --> 08:36.460
You ââ You hurt
my friends.

08:36.560 --> 08:40.400
Huh?
Nobody hurts my friends!

08:44.680 --> 08:46.260
( Bzzt! )

08:46.360 --> 08:47.620
Whoa!

08:47.720 --> 08:49.180
Aah!

08:49.280 --> 08:51.860
( Grunting ) Okay,
that kind of hurt a little.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.960
( Grunts )

08:55.720 --> 08:56.860
Hmpf!

08:56.960 --> 08:59.860
Aah!

08:59.960 --> 09:02.700
Look, man,
I was just doing my job.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.260
Who hired you?
You did.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.740
What?

09:06.840 --> 09:08.840
You want to know
where I live?

09:10.520 --> 09:12.520
The space tree.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.780
( Sighs, gasps )

09:17.880 --> 09:20.620
I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.720
( Shudders )

09:23.840 --> 09:26.860
Stay away from me
and my friends!

09:26.960 --> 09:28.960
Aah!

09:31.760 --> 09:33.340
( All sigh )

09:33.440 --> 09:34.460
Pops, did it work?

09:34.560 --> 09:36.180
Let's just say

09:36.280 --> 09:39.780
I put a good scare into
the ole' nightmare alien.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.100
So, yes?
That's a yes, right?

09:42.200 --> 09:44.020
Yes.
All: Yes!

09:44.120 --> 09:48.340
Now to get back
to my normal dreams.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.780
Hit it.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.980
( Yells )

10:01.080 --> 10:05.580
Granny's Diner ââ
worst service, ever!

10:05.680 --> 10:07.900
One star.
( Laughs )

10:08.000 --> 10:10.660
And I didn't even eat there!

10:10.760 --> 10:14.940
