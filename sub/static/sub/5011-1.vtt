03:08.272 --> 03:11.024
Thank you very much
and welcome to To Tell the Truth.

03:11.108 --> 03:15.528
Our first guest, he's made a career out
of being the most outrageous impostor

03:15.613 --> 03:19.783
that we've ever come across
on this show. You'll see what I mean.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.369
Number One,
what is your name, please?

03:22.453 --> 03:24.454
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.957
- Number Two?
- My name is Frank William Abagnale.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.461
- Number Three?
- My name is Frank William Abagnale.

03:31.629 --> 03:34.381
From 1964 to 1967,

03:34.465 --> 03:38.551
I successfully impersonated
an airline pilot for Pan Am Airways,

03:38.636 --> 03:41.471
and I flew over two million miles
for free.

03:41.597 --> 03:42.722
During that time,

03:42.807 --> 03:46.726
I was also the Chief Resident
Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital

03:46.811 --> 03:50.230
and an Assistant Attorney General
for the State of Louisiana.

03:50.314 --> 03:51.898
By the time I was caught,

03:51.982 --> 03:56.403
I was considered the youngest and most
daring con man in U.S. history.

03:56.487 --> 03:59.656
I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent checks

03:59.782 --> 04:02.992
in 26 foreign countries and all 50 states.

04:03.077 --> 04:06.329
And I did it all before my 19th birthday.

04:06.664 --> 04:09.666
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.923
So, for the first time,
he'll have to tell the truth.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.091
We'll start our questioning with Kitty.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.928
Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent,

04:22.012 --> 04:24.097
and you're obviously
a very bright fellow,

04:24.181 --> 04:27.475
why didn't you go in for
a legitimate profession?

04:27.685 --> 04:29.769
It was a question of dollars and cents.

04:29.854 --> 04:31.729
When I was a young man,
I needed the money,

04:31.814 --> 04:34.524
and I thought this list of careers was
the easiest way to get it.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.445
I see. Number Two,
I find this all very fascinating.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.156
Who was it that finally caught you?

04:42.032 --> 04:43.700
His name was Carl Hanratty.

04:47.413 --> 04:48.746
Hanratty.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.793
I am

04:54.420 --> 04:55.837
Carl Hanratty.

04:55.921 --> 04:59.507
I represent the F.B.I.
from the United States of America.

05:02.052 --> 05:05.305
I have orders to see
the American prisoner, Abagnale.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.668
You sit here.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.963
You do not open the door.

05:40.049 --> 05:41.966
You do not pass him

05:43.052 --> 05:45.303
anything through the hole.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.566
Aw, Jesus.

06:18.963 --> 06:21.047
You know,
I've got a little bit of a cold myself.

06:22.258 --> 06:25.093
Frank, I'm here to read
the articles of extradition

06:25.177 --> 06:27.971
according to the European Court
for Human Rights.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.389
"Article One,

06:29.473 --> 06:32.767
"extradition shall be granted
in respect of offenses..."

06:32.851 --> 06:35.520
Help me.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.314
Help me.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.026
Frank, stop it.

06:42.611 --> 06:43.903
Help me.

06:45.281 --> 06:48.575
You don't think
you're actually going to fool me, do you?

06:50.327 --> 06:53.496
Sixteen pages to go.
Stay with me. "Article Two,

06:53.622 --> 06:56.749
"if the request for extradition
includes separate offenses...

06:56.834 --> 07:01.004
"...each of which is punishable under
the laws of the requesting party..."

07:01.922 --> 07:03.131
Frank?

07:05.634 --> 07:06.843
Frank?

07:07.469 --> 07:08.845
God damn it!

07:08.971 --> 07:12.181
Get me a doctor in here!
I need a doctor!

07:12.266 --> 07:14.267
- Yes.
- Doctor! Now!

07:14.351 --> 07:16.936
Don't sweat it.
We'll get you right to a doctor.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.944
If you can hear me, don't worry.
I'll take you home in the morning.

07:25.029 --> 07:27.196
Home in the morning, Frank.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.453
- What are you doing?
- Washing off the lice.

07:33.537 --> 07:36.789
This man has to be on a plane
for America. He has to see a doctor.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.958
Yes, the doctor comes in tomorrow.

07:39.043 --> 07:42.378
I've worked too long, too hard,
for you to take this away from me.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.298
If he dies, I'm holding you responsible.

07:58.062 --> 07:59.312
Oh, Frank.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.356
Okay, Carl,

08:43.732 --> 08:45.274
let's go home.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.361
The New Rochelle Rotary Club

08:48.445 --> 08:51.364
has a history that goes back to 1919.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.866
In all those years,

08:53.951 --> 08:57.370
we've only seen a handful
of deserving gentlemen

08:57.454 --> 08:59.747
inducted as lifetime members.

09:00.541 --> 09:04.711
It's an honor that has seen 57 names

09:04.920 --> 09:06.963
enshrined on the wall of honor.

09:07.089 --> 09:09.257
And tonight, we make it 58.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.801
So please stand

09:11.969 --> 09:16.431
as I present my very good friend,
a man who keeps our pencils sharp

09:16.932 --> 09:18.766
and our pens in ink.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.477
Frank William Abagnale.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.915
I stand here, humbled

09:43.667 --> 09:46.586
by the presence of
Mayor Robert Wagner

09:50.632 --> 09:53.968
and our club president, Jack Barnes.

09:58.807 --> 10:02.435
Most of all, I'm honored to see
my loving wife, Paula

10:05.355 --> 10:08.191
and my son, Frank, Jr.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.692
Come on.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.784
Sitting in the front row.

10:22.372 --> 10:26.042
Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream.

10:26.877 --> 10:30.671
The first mouse quickly gave up
and drowned.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.382
The second mouse

10:34.134 --> 10:35.301
wouldn't quit.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.678
He struggled so hard

10:37.805 --> 10:40.973
that eventually he churned that cream
into butter

10:41.141 --> 10:42.809
and crawled out.

10:43.227 --> 10:47.063
Gentlemen, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.166
You're a better dancer
than your father.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.085
- Hear that, Daddy?
- Like fun.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.628
The girls don't know
what they're in for.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.965
Show him the dance you were doing
when we met.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.758
Oh, who can remember?

11:15.926 --> 11:20.346
The people in that little French village
were so happy to see Americans,

11:20.430 --> 11:23.015
they decided to put on a show for us.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.853
- So they crammed 200 soldiers...
- We know the story, Daddy.

11:26.937 --> 11:29.021
...into that tiny social hall,

11:29.106 --> 11:32.191
and the first person to walk on stage
is your mother

11:32.276 --> 11:34.277
and she starts to dance.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.946
You know, it had been months

11:37.030 --> 11:40.700
since we'd seen a woman,
and here's this blond angel.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.535
Blond bombshell.

11:44.580 --> 11:47.456
And the men
are literally holding their breath.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.585
Holding their breath for you. Hear that?

11:52.296 --> 11:54.130
I turned to my buddies and I said...

11:54.214 --> 11:56.799
"I will not leave France without her."

11:56.925 --> 11:58.384
And I didn't.

11:58.468 --> 11:59.927
You didn't.

12:00.637 --> 12:01.971
I didn't.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.765
Oh, shit, the rug.

12:05.309 --> 12:06.976
- Oh, Mom.
- I can't believe I...

12:07.102 --> 12:08.060
It's nothing.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.396
- Frankie, run and get a towel.
- Yeah.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.772
Come on.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.487
Dance with me, Paula.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.293
Whenever I dance for you,
I get in trouble.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.347
Oh!

12:46.141 --> 12:48.601
Frank. Wake up. Come on, let's go.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.353
Get up, come on.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.272
- Frank, wake up.
- Dad.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.942
You don't have to go to school today.
It's okay.

12:56.026 --> 12:59.195
- Why? Is it snowing?
- Do you have a black suit?

12:59.363 --> 13:01.364
I overslept again.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.700
We have a very important meeting
in the city. Eat that.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.035
Come on.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.788
Ma'am, open up, please.
It's important.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.457
What? Oh, gosh.

13:11.625 --> 13:15.461
- We don't open for half an hour.
- Just open the door. It's important.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.797
I'm sorry, we don't open for half an hour.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.465
What's your name, ma'am?

13:19.549 --> 13:22.134
- Darcy.
- Darcy. That's a pretty name.

13:22.219 --> 13:25.554
I'm in a fix. I need a suit for my kid.
This is my son, Frank.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.306
He needs a black suit.

13:27.391 --> 13:31.727
There was a death in the family.
My father, 85 years old, war hero.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.981
There's a funeral this afternoon,
military funeral,

13:35.065 --> 13:38.150
planes flying overhead, 21 -gun salute.

13:38.402 --> 13:41.487
Frank needs to borrow a suit
for a couple of hours.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.240
I'm sorry,
we don't loan suits and we're not open.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.659
Darcy, please. Come back.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.538
Darcy, is this yours?

13:56.086 --> 13:58.713
I just found it in the parking lot.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.464
Uh-huh.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.884
Must have slipped right off your neck.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.264
Don't hit the curb.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.647
Now get out, walk around the back
and hold the door open for me.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.119
- What's next?
- Okay. Stop grinning.

14:30.245 --> 14:33.372
When I get inside,
go back to the front seat and wait.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.708
Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket,

14:35.792 --> 14:37.877
don't move the car, understood?

14:37.961 --> 14:39.712
Dad, what's all this for?

14:39.796 --> 14:41.922
You know why the Yankees always win?

14:42.632 --> 14:43.716
Because they have Mickey Mantle?

14:43.800 --> 14:47.720
No, it's because the other teams can't
stop staring at those damn pinstripes.

14:47.804 --> 14:51.307
Watch this. The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank

14:51.892 --> 14:54.810
is about to open the door for your father.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.481
Mr. Abagnale,

14:59.149 --> 15:01.233
we don't usually loan money to people

15:01.318 --> 15:03.903
who have unresolved business
with the IRS.

15:03.987 --> 15:07.156
That's a misunderstanding.
I hired the wrong guy to do my books.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.492
A mistake anybody could make.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.328
I just need you guys
to help me weather the storm.

15:12.454 --> 15:15.331
You're being investigated
by the government for tax fraud.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.917
My store is
a landmark in New Rochelle.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.169
I have customers all over New York.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.379
You're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.589
We don't know you.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.675
I'm sure your bank in New Rochelle
could help you out.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.344
My bank went out of business.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.679
Banks like this one
put them out of business.

15:30.764 --> 15:35.101
I know I made a mistake, I admit that.
But these people want blood.

15:35.185 --> 15:38.979
They want my store.
They've threatened to put me in jail.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.858
This is America, right?
I'm not a criminal.

15:42.943 --> 15:46.529
I'm a Medal of Honor winner. A member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.

15:46.655 --> 15:50.157
All I'm asking is
for you to help me beat these guys.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.869
It's not a question of winning and losing,
it's a question of risk.

15:54.871 --> 15:58.374
You're the largest bank in the world.
Where's the...

15:59.334 --> 16:01.043
Where's the risk?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.717
How could you let him
take our car like that?

16:08.844 --> 16:12.638
He didn't take anything, we took him.
He overpaid by 500.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.392
Come on, Frank. Let's return the suit.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.819
This place is good.

16:26.903 --> 16:30.072
It's small, but it's gonna be
a lot less work.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.783
A lot less work for you.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.141
Hey, Dad.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.101
Hi.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.647
Where is your mother?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.358
I don't know.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.113
She said something
about going to look for a job.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.701
What's she going to be,
a shoe salesman at a centipede farm?

17:21.290 --> 17:23.083
What are you doing?

17:24.294 --> 17:26.252
You want some pancakes?

17:26.338 --> 17:29.506
For dinner? On my son's 16th birthday?

17:29.591 --> 17:32.009
We're not going to eat pancakes.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.098
Why are you looking at me like that?
You thought I forgot?

17:38.183 --> 17:41.268
- I didn't think you forgot.
- I opened a checking account

17:41.353 --> 17:42.853
in your name.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.398
I put $25 in the account
so you can buy whatever you want.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.651
- Don't tell your mother.
- I won't.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.194
Thanks, Dad.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.822
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan?

17:53.907 --> 17:56.200
Yes, they all turned me down.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.661
Then why you opening
a banking account with them?

17:58.745 --> 18:01.580
Because one day, you'll want
something from these people.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.415
A house, a car...

18:03.875 --> 18:05.918
They have all the money.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.049
There's 50 checks there, Frank,

18:12.133 --> 18:14.551
which means, from this day on,

18:16.930 --> 18:19.181
you're in their little club.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.767
I'm in their little club.

18:22.394 --> 18:24.687
You got that, you got it all.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.189
It's even got my name there.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.694
- To the moon.
- To the moon.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.196
To the moon.

18:43.248 --> 18:45.541
See that? It's just a school.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.377
No different than Westbourne.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.338
Ma, you said you were going to quit.

18:55.010 --> 18:58.304
Frankie, you don't have to wear
the uniform here.

18:59.431 --> 19:02.016
Why don't you take off your jacket?

19:02.350 --> 19:03.934
I'm used to it.

19:09.441 --> 19:10.983
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

19:11.067 --> 19:12.943
Do you know where room 17,
French is?

19:13.028 --> 19:14.153
Yeah...

19:28.793 --> 19:30.502
You selling encyclopedias?

19:30.587 --> 19:33.172
He looks like a substitute teacher.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.647
Quiet down, people!

19:50.940 --> 19:52.983
My name is Mr. Abagnale!

19:53.443 --> 19:56.695
That's Abagnale, not Abagnolee,

19:56.821 --> 19:59.698
not Abagnelee, but Abagnale.

20:00.825 --> 20:05.079
Now, somebody please tell me
where you left off in your textbooks.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.748
Excuse me, people.
If I need to ask again,

20:07.832 --> 20:09.166
I'm gonna write up the entire class.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.918
Take your seats!

20:15.548 --> 20:17.091
Chapter seven.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.927
Would you please open your textbooks
to chapter eight

20:20.011 --> 20:21.929
and we'll get started.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.681
- Excuse me. What's your name?
- Brad.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.308
Why don't you get up here

20:26.393 --> 20:30.145
in front of the class
and read conversation number five?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.578
They sent for me.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.540
They said they needed
a sub for Roberta.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.042
I came all the way from Dixon.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.379
I always sub for Roberta.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.673
Excuse me, why aren't you reading?

20:59.134 --> 21:02.553
I'll never come back
to Bellarmine-Jefferson again!

21:02.804 --> 21:04.596
You tell them not to call me.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.057
Do they think it's easy
for a woman my age

21:07.142 --> 21:10.769
and all the money that it costs to travel?
I tell you, they don't give a damn.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.438
Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale,

21:12.522 --> 21:15.315
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.402
I regret to inform you
that for the past week,

21:18.486 --> 21:22.072
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.242
He what?

21:25.702 --> 21:29.496
Your son has been pretending to be
a substitute teacher.

21:29.747 --> 21:33.167
Lecturing the students,
giving out homework...

21:33.668 --> 21:35.836
Mrs. Glasser has been ill,

21:35.920 --> 21:39.089
and there was some confusion
with the real sub.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.177
Your son held
a teacher-parent conference yesterday

21:43.261 --> 21:45.596
and was planning a class field trip

21:45.680 --> 21:48.390
to a French bread factory in Trenton.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.810
Do you see the problem we have?

21:53.688 --> 21:57.733
I've a note to miss fifth and sixth period
today. Doctor's appointment.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.402
One moment. I'll be right with you.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.282
- You should fold it.
- What?

22:05.867 --> 22:08.827
That note. It's a fake, right?
You should fold it.

22:08.912 --> 22:11.705
It's a note from my mom.
I have a doctor's appointment.

22:11.789 --> 22:14.625
Yeah, but there's no crease
in the paper.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.543
When your mom hands you a note
to miss school,

22:16.628 --> 22:20.547
the first thing you do is fold it
and put it in your pocket.

22:20.632 --> 22:23.133
If it's real, where's the crease?

22:32.894 --> 22:34.186
Frankie.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.537
Ma, I'm home.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.876
Remember that girl Joanna
I was telling you about?

22:58.253 --> 23:00.170
I asked her out today.

23:01.339 --> 23:04.341
Think we're going to go
to the junior prom.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.844
Ma, is this my driver's license?

23:07.929 --> 23:10.472
That's all there is, two bedrooms.

23:10.598 --> 23:11.890
Frankie.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.142
You remember Dad's friend?

23:14.561 --> 23:16.853
Jack Barnes. From the club.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.105
Hello.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.399
He came by looking for your father.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.026
I was giving him a tour of the apartment.

23:23.111 --> 23:26.029
It's very spacious, Paula.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.662
Dad is at the store.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.872
So, Frank,

23:36.749 --> 23:40.419
you're getting to look
more like your old man every day.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.756
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.801
- I'll see you later.
- Wait.

23:53.308 --> 23:54.850
Is this yours?

23:55.435 --> 23:56.476
Oh.

23:57.729 --> 24:00.689
Thanks, Frank.
That's the President's pin.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.818
I'd be in deep trouble if I lost that.

24:10.575 --> 24:12.576
I'll see you all later.

24:22.378 --> 24:25.714
Are you hungry, Frankie?
I'll make you a sandwich.

24:34.682 --> 24:37.809
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

24:39.020 --> 24:42.689
He thinks we should get a lawyer
and sue the government.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.652
That it's not legal,
what they're doing to us.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.865
Why aren't you saying anything?

24:58.122 --> 25:01.083
You're not going to tell him, are you?

25:02.627 --> 25:03.710
No.

25:04.587 --> 25:07.339
That's right. There's nothing to tell.

25:08.591 --> 25:13.053
I'm going out for a few hours to visit
some old friends from the tennis club.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.390
When I get home,
we'll all have dinner together.

25:16.724 --> 25:17.974
Right?

25:18.935 --> 25:22.437
But you won't say anything
because it's just silly,

25:22.563 --> 25:23.897
isn't it?

25:24.399 --> 25:26.483
How could we sue anybody?

25:32.198 --> 25:34.616
Do you need some money, Frankie?

25:35.034 --> 25:38.120
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

25:38.454 --> 25:40.580
Here. Take $5.

25:42.250 --> 25:43.458
Or 10.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.967
You promised you were going to quit.

26:10.987 --> 26:12.487
Ma, I'm home.

26:27.462 --> 26:28.670
Hey, hey!

26:28.755 --> 26:30.547
You stay away from me. You hear me?

26:30.631 --> 26:33.341
I don't know who you are,
but if you come back here...

26:33.426 --> 26:36.428
Frank, calm down, will you?
I'm Dick Kesner.

26:37.430 --> 26:40.891
I want you to leave your things here,
follow me into the next room.

26:40.975 --> 26:43.518
Okay? They're all waiting for you.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.398
You don't have to be scared.
I'm right here, Frank.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.275
I'll always be here.

26:50.359 --> 26:54.446
But there are laws. Everything in
this country has to be legal.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.282
So what we need to do
is make some decisions.

26:57.366 --> 26:58.825
That's what Mr. Kesner is here for.

26:58.910 --> 27:01.620
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.748
But that can be very expensive,
people fighting over their children.

27:04.832 --> 27:06.082
Nobody is fighting.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.919
Look at me, Frank. Nobody is fighting.

27:17.678 --> 27:21.598
Do you remember your grandma? Eve?
She arrived this morning.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.517
Hello.

27:32.777 --> 27:36.112
Do you understand
what we're saying to you, Frank?

27:37.406 --> 27:40.659
Your father and I are getting a divorce.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.706
Nothing's going to change.
We're still gonna see each other.

27:46.791 --> 27:50.377
- Stop it, please. Don't interrupt.
- You don't have to read all of this.

27:50.461 --> 27:53.213
Most of it is for your parents,
boring adult business.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.924
But this paragraph right here,
this is important

27:56.008 --> 27:59.177
because it states
who you're gonna live with

28:00.304 --> 28:01.763
after the divorce.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.723
Whose custody you will be in.

28:03.808 --> 28:06.434
And there's a blank space right here.

28:07.812 --> 28:11.147
I want you to go into the kitchen,
sit at the table

28:11.232 --> 28:12.732
and put a name down.

28:12.817 --> 28:13.984
You can take as long as you want,

28:14.068 --> 28:15.610
but when you come back into this room,

28:15.695 --> 28:18.196
I want to see a name on that line.

28:18.281 --> 28:22.117
Frank, just write down
a name and this will all be over.

28:22.326 --> 28:23.869
It's going to be okay.

28:23.953 --> 28:25.620
Dad, what name?

28:25.705 --> 28:26.997
Your mother or your father.

28:27.081 --> 28:29.958
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

28:30.042 --> 28:33.253
And don't look so scared. It's not a test.

28:34.005 --> 28:36.089
There's no wrong answer.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.647
One ticket to Grand Central, please.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.774
That will be $3.50, sir.

28:56.027 --> 28:58.570
Is it okay if I write you a check?

29:03.784 --> 29:06.202
Carl, when do I get to call my father?

29:06.579 --> 29:09.247
You can call him when we get
to New York.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.499
We leave for the airport in seven hours.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.128
Until then, just sit there.

29:15.296 --> 29:16.630
Be quiet.

29:17.715 --> 29:21.509
On the other side of the hotel,
they got suites that face the park.

29:22.887 --> 29:25.639
It's the best room the F.B.I. can afford.

29:28.476 --> 29:30.894
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.313
Please. You have to listen.

29:33.397 --> 29:36.733
I don't want to hear your story.
Two checks bounced.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.610
You know how much trouble I'm in?

29:38.694 --> 29:41.196
No, but listen. I'm telling you.
The bank, they made the mistake.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.906
I'll write you another check right now!

29:42.990 --> 29:45.033
What? Do I look like
I was born yesterday?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.994
Look, it's midnight.
Where am I going to go?

29:48.079 --> 29:50.413
You're a goddamn kid. Go home.

30:38.629 --> 30:42.173
I hope you understand. My boss
sent me to Brooklyn, then Queens.

30:42.258 --> 30:43.717
Now he wants me in Long Island

30:43.801 --> 30:46.594
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.

30:46.679 --> 30:50.598
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to cash checks from other banks.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.601
- How would we know if they were good?
- What did you say your name was?

30:53.686 --> 30:55.395
- Ashley.
- Ashley.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.732
You know what I found
on the sidewalk out there?

31:03.654 --> 31:06.406
Must have slipped right off your neck.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.580
Is there something
I can help you with, son?

31:13.664 --> 31:15.957
It's my grandmother's birthday
next week

31:16.042 --> 31:18.668
and I want to get her something
extra special.

31:18.753 --> 31:22.589
Please, it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.

31:24.341 --> 31:27.010
Please, just $5.
No one would have to know.

31:27.094 --> 31:30.472
I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed to take checks

31:30.556 --> 31:32.682
from people we don't know.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.499
Welcome to New York.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.059
Pleasure to have you back, Captain.

32:16.185 --> 32:20.271
What do you think, Angelo?
The tomatoes are ripe this afternoon.

32:27.571 --> 32:28.696
What have we here?

32:28.781 --> 32:30.865
- Can I have your autograph?
- You betcha.

32:30.950 --> 32:32.992
- Can I have your autograph, too?
- You gonna be a pilot?

32:33.077 --> 32:34.369
Mmm-hmm.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.788
There you go. Work hard in school.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.206
Dear Dad,

32:38.290 --> 32:40.792
I've decided to become an airline pilot.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.710
I've applied to all the big airlines,

32:42.795 --> 32:45.880
and I have several promising interviews
lined up.

32:46.215 --> 32:49.050
How is Mom?
Have you called her lately?

32:49.135 --> 32:51.719
Love, your son, Frank.

32:55.391 --> 32:56.599
Hello.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.477
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School,

32:59.562 --> 33:02.272
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

33:02.398 --> 33:05.150
You're the young man who's writing
the article for the school paper.

33:05.234 --> 33:06.234
Yes, ma'am. That's me.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.736
I want to know everything there is
to know about being a pilot.

33:09.572 --> 33:13.074
What airports does Pan Am fly to?
What does a pilot make in a year?

33:13.159 --> 33:14.868
Who tells them where they're gonna
fly to?

33:14.952 --> 33:17.162
- Slow down. Take them one at a time.
- All right.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.998
What does it mean when
one pilot says to another pilot,

33:20.082 --> 33:21.249
"What kind of equipment are you on?"

33:21.333 --> 33:25.170
They want to know what aircraft
you're flying. DC-8, 707, Constellation...

33:25.254 --> 33:28.256
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.675
Every pilot must have two things
with him at all times.

33:30.759 --> 33:34.262
One is his airline personnel badge,
looks just like this one from Pan Am.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.931
The other one is their FAA license.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.517
And that looks just like this.

33:40.603 --> 33:41.728
Oh...

33:42.438 --> 33:45.064
Do you think I could make a copy
of this to put into my article?

33:45.149 --> 33:48.276
Frank, you can have that one,
it's three years expired.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.445
Thanks. And what about
your I.D. badge?

33:50.529 --> 33:51.821
Do you have an extra one
I could borrow?

33:51.947 --> 33:53.448
No, I can't help you there.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.033
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

33:55.117 --> 33:57.952
The only way to get one
is to become a real live pilot

33:58.037 --> 33:59.495
for Pan American Airways.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.211
Pan Am, may I help you?

34:06.295 --> 34:08.630
Yeah. Hello, I'm calling about a uniform.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.965
- Hold for Purchasing.
- Thank you.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.257
Purchasing.

34:12.342 --> 34:15.011
I'm a copilot based out of
San Francisco.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.263
I flew a flight into New York last night,

34:17.348 --> 34:20.641
but the problem is I'm headed out
to Paris in three hours.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.393
How can we help you?

34:22.478 --> 34:25.980
I sent my uniform to be cleaned
through the hotel

34:26.190 --> 34:28.024
and I guess they must have lost it.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.443
They lost a uniform.
Happens all the time.

34:30.527 --> 34:33.487
Go down to the Well-Built Uniform
Company at 9th and Broadway.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.656
They're our uniform supplier.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.741
I'll tell Mr. Rosen you're coming.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.784
You look too young to be a pilot.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.495
I'm a copilot.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.371
Why so nervous?

34:42.831 --> 34:47.043
How would you feel if you lost
your uniform first week on the job?

34:47.168 --> 34:50.170
Relax.
Pan Am has got lots of uniforms.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.507
It's gonna be $164.

34:53.384 --> 34:55.510
Great. I'll write you a check.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.720
Sorry, no checks, no cash.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.306
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. number.

35:00.391 --> 35:04.519
I'll bill Pan Am, and they'll take it out
of your next paycheck.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.021
Even better.

35:09.191 --> 35:10.400
Dear Dad,

35:10.526 --> 35:13.569
you always told me
that an honest man has nothing to fear.

35:13.696 --> 35:16.531
So I'm trying my best not to be afraid.

35:16.699 --> 35:19.742
I'm sorry I ran away,
but you don't have to worry.

35:19.868 --> 35:24.205
I'm gonna get it all back now, Daddy.
I promise. I'm gonna get it all back.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.547
Are you a real live pilot?

35:32.631 --> 35:34.882
I sure am, little lady. What's your name?

35:34.967 --> 35:37.635
- Celine.
- Celine, it's a pleasure to meet you.

35:37.720 --> 35:40.138
It's a pleasure to meet you, too.

35:43.934 --> 35:48.313
That's 50, 70, 80, 90,

35:48.397 --> 35:50.148
$100.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.525
You have yourself a great time in Paris.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.068
I always do.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.070
Excuse me.

35:57.406 --> 35:59.407
I'm John Modiger. I manage this branch.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.701
I want to thank you for coming in
and using our institution.

36:01.785 --> 36:03.870
It's a pleasure to meet you, John.
I'll be back again.

36:03.954 --> 36:04.954
Good.

36:05.164 --> 36:07.582
Have you stayed with us before?

36:07.916 --> 36:11.169
No, I've been primarily based
on the West Coast.

36:11.754 --> 36:13.671
Is it all right if I write you a check
for the room?

36:13.756 --> 36:15.798
- No problem, sir.
- Great.

36:25.184 --> 36:28.436
I was also wondering
if I could write you a personal check?

36:28.520 --> 36:31.731
For airline personnel,
we cash personal checks up to $100.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.483
Payroll checks we cash up to 300.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.779
Did you say 300 for a payroll check?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.160
Dear Dad,

36:44.370 --> 36:47.747
I've decided to become a pilot
for Pan American Airways,

36:47.831 --> 36:50.249
the most trusted name in the skies.

36:50.334 --> 36:54.545
They've accepted me into their training
program and told me if I work hard,

36:54.630 --> 36:56.881
I should earn my wings real soon.

36:56.965 --> 37:00.093
Please get in touch with Joanna Carlton
from the 10th grade.

37:00.177 --> 37:03.304
Tell her I'm sorry that I could not
take her to the junior prom.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.681
Love, your son, Frank.

37:44.263 --> 37:46.431
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

37:46.515 --> 37:48.641
I have a payroll check I'd like to cash.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.184
Certainly.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.271
Excuse me.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.023
I'm sure you hear this all the time,

37:56.108 --> 37:59.694
but you have the most beautiful eyes
I have ever seen.

38:00.446 --> 38:02.947
Yeah, I do get that all the time.

38:03.866 --> 38:05.366
How would you like it?

38:20.966 --> 38:25.261
I'm sorry, sir. We won't have any cash
until the banks open in an hour.

38:25.387 --> 38:28.890
But I'm sure they can cash your check
at the airport.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.892
The airport?

38:31.018 --> 38:33.269
Who cashes checks at the airport?

38:33.395 --> 38:36.898
The airlines.
They've always taken care of their own.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.284
- Hello.
- Hi. Are you deadheading?

38:48.911 --> 38:49.952
What?

38:50.078 --> 38:52.413
Are you my deadhead to Miami?

38:54.750 --> 38:56.083
Yes.

38:56.919 --> 38:59.587
Yeah, I'm the deadhead. Here you go.

39:00.214 --> 39:03.424
You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.

39:05.886 --> 39:08.804
It's been a while since I've done this.
Which one is the jump seat again?

39:11.225 --> 39:12.975
Have a nice flight.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.061
Are you my deadhead?

39:17.397 --> 39:20.650
Frank, Captain Oliver.
John Larkin, the copilot.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.527
Fred Tulley, flight engineer.

39:22.611 --> 39:25.363
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.
Thanks for giving me a lift, boys.

39:25.447 --> 39:28.366
Go ahead and take a seat, Frank.
We're about to push.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.618
What kind of equipment you on, DC-8?

39:30.744 --> 39:31.827
707.

39:32.162 --> 39:34.372
You turning around on the redeye?

39:34.456 --> 39:36.791
I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months,

39:36.917 --> 39:40.127
trying to earn my keep running
leap frogs for the weak and weary.

39:40.254 --> 39:42.797
No shame in that. We all did it.

39:49.972 --> 39:52.014
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.309
Would you like a drink after takeoff?

39:55.435 --> 39:56.602
Milk?

39:57.020 --> 39:58.980
- Eighty knots.
- Check.

39:59.481 --> 40:01.107
V-one. Rotate.

40:04.111 --> 40:05.987
V-two. Positive rate.

40:06.113 --> 40:07.363
Gear up.

40:08.156 --> 40:10.825
Dear Dad,
today was graduation.

40:11.368 --> 40:15.997
I am now a copilot,
earning $1,400 a month, plus benefits.

40:16.290 --> 40:20.251
And the best part is,
they tell me my family can fly for free.

40:20.335 --> 40:23.212
So tell Mom to pack her bags
and buy a new swimsuit

40:23.338 --> 40:26.716
because I'm taking us all to Hawaii
for Christmas.

40:26.842 --> 40:30.219
I love you, Dad. Aloha, Frank.

40:31.179 --> 40:32.597
- Hello, deadhead.
- Hello.

40:32.681 --> 40:34.724
Enjoying your free ride?

40:40.731 --> 40:42.023
Marci,

40:43.233 --> 40:45.026
did you drop this?

40:48.030 --> 40:51.032
- Must have slipped right off your neck.
- No.

40:52.701 --> 40:53.826
No!

40:56.204 --> 40:59.081
Yes, yes, yes!

41:06.923 --> 41:08.841
Why are you stopping?

41:10.260 --> 41:12.887
I want to tell you something, Marci.

41:14.514 --> 41:16.223
This is by far

41:17.517 --> 41:20.561
the best date I have ever been on.

41:52.636 --> 41:55.513
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?

41:55.597 --> 41:58.224
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.

41:58.308 --> 42:01.435
I'd like to cash this check and then

42:02.437 --> 42:04.772
I'd like to take you out
for a steak dinner.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.702
Then we feed the checks
into the MICR machine,

42:17.786 --> 42:19.245
which uses special ink to encode

42:19.329 --> 42:22.123
the account numbers
on the bottom of the checks.

42:22.833 --> 42:25.126
And where are these numbers?

42:26.920 --> 42:28.963
- They're right here.
- Right there?

42:32.634 --> 42:34.635
They're called routing numbers.

42:34.761 --> 42:37.471
So where do the checks get routed to?

42:39.015 --> 42:42.101
I don't exactly know.
Nobody ever asked me that before.

42:43.645 --> 42:47.064
Our next item up for bid is also from
the Jersey Central Bank foreclosure.

42:47.149 --> 42:50.484
This is a MICR encoder,
a machine used to encode bank checks.

42:50.610 --> 42:51.986
Do I have an opening bid?

42:52.112 --> 42:53.904
Our unknown subject
is a paperhanger

42:53.989 --> 42:55.448
who started working on the East Coast.

42:55.532 --> 42:57.241
In the last few weeks,
this unsub has developed

42:57.325 --> 43:00.244
a new form of check fraud
I'm calling "The Float."

43:00.328 --> 43:03.205
What he's doing is he's opening
checking accounts at various banks,

43:03.331 --> 43:06.792
then changing the MICR ink routing
numbers at the bottom of those checks.

43:06.877 --> 43:10.588
Next slide, please. Next slide, please.

43:11.173 --> 43:14.049
The remote thing is broken.
You'll have to do it by hand.

43:16.344 --> 43:19.680
Agent Mullen, it should be
the square button by the side.

43:19.806 --> 43:22.183
This carousel doesn't work.
It's a bad carousel.

43:22.309 --> 43:24.059
- Thank you.
- Move it manually.

43:24.186 --> 43:27.813
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

43:27.898 --> 43:29.148
Slide.

43:30.192 --> 43:32.526
MICR scanners at every bank
read these numbers

43:32.611 --> 43:34.570
at the bottom of the check. Slide.

43:34.654 --> 43:37.990
And then ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

43:38.074 --> 43:41.577
Carl, for those of us
who are unfamiliar with bank fraud,

43:41.828 --> 43:44.955
you mind telling us
what the hell you're talking about?

43:45.040 --> 43:49.126
The East Coast branches
are numbered 01 to 06.

43:49.211 --> 43:51.796
The central branch is 07, 08,
so on and so forth.

43:51.880 --> 43:54.548
You mean those numbers at the bottom
of a check actually mean something?

43:54.674 --> 43:58.636
All of this was in the report I filed
two days ago. If you change

43:58.720 --> 44:03.057
a 02 to a 12, that means that check,

44:03.266 --> 44:04.475
which was cashed in New York,

44:04.559 --> 44:06.018
does not go
to the New York Federal Branch,

44:06.102 --> 44:10.439
but it is re-routed all the way
to the San Francisco Federal Branch.

44:10.524 --> 44:13.025
The bank doesn't even know
the check has bounced for two weeks.

44:13.109 --> 44:15.736
Which means our unsub
can stay in one place,

44:15.862 --> 44:19.573
paper the same city over and over again
while his checks circle the country.

44:19.699 --> 44:21.909
You want to talk to my wife.

44:22.410 --> 44:24.745
She's the one who balances
the checkbook at our house.

44:30.210 --> 44:31.585
Next slide.

44:38.718 --> 44:39.927
Daddy.

44:42.264 --> 44:44.974
My son, the birdman.
That's some uniform, Frank.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.809
What do you think?

44:47.477 --> 44:48.644
Nice.

44:48.937 --> 44:50.271
Sit down.

44:53.400 --> 44:56.026
Dad, have you gotten the postcards?

44:56.111 --> 44:57.361
Of course.

44:57.445 --> 44:58.946
This fork is ice-cold.

44:59.072 --> 45:01.991
No, Dad, that's a chilled salad fork.

45:03.785 --> 45:06.287
It's a fancy restaurant, you know.

45:11.209 --> 45:12.376
Here.

45:13.962 --> 45:16.463
- I got you something.
- What's that?

45:16.590 --> 45:17.882
Open it.

45:23.388 --> 45:25.764
You know what those are, right?

45:26.433 --> 45:30.895
Those are the keys
to a 1965 Cadillac DeVille convertible.

45:30.979 --> 45:34.398
Brand-new, Dad.
Red with white interior,

45:34.482 --> 45:37.818
split seats, air conditioning, the works.

45:38.153 --> 45:40.154
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

45:40.238 --> 45:42.323
I'm giving you a Cadillac.

45:42.574 --> 45:44.491
Dad, she's parked downstairs.

45:44.576 --> 45:47.912
When we're done eating lunch, why
don't you drive on over to Mom's house,

45:47.996 --> 45:49.997
pick her up, take a little joy ride?

45:50.081 --> 45:51.749
Do you know what would happen

45:51.833 --> 45:55.628
if the IRS found out I was driving around
in a new coupe?

45:57.339 --> 46:01.008
I took the train here, Frank.
I'm taking the train home.

46:03.094 --> 46:04.470
All right.

46:11.686 --> 46:13.604
I have plenty of money.

46:13.688 --> 46:16.023
You know, if you ever need anything.

46:16.149 --> 46:18.776
You worried? About me?

46:19.861 --> 46:21.779
No, I'm not worried.

46:21.863 --> 46:23.948
You think I can't buy my own car?

46:24.032 --> 46:27.368
Two mice fell in a bucket
of cream, Frank.

46:28.370 --> 46:29.954
Which one am I?

46:30.872 --> 46:32.957
You're that second mouse.

46:34.834 --> 46:36.961
I went by the store today.

46:38.296 --> 46:41.799
I had to close the store for a while.
It's all about timing, Frank.

46:41.883 --> 46:44.969
Goddamn government knows that.
They hit you when you're down.

46:45.053 --> 46:47.888
I wasn't going to let them take it
from me, so I just

46:48.014 --> 46:50.474
shut the doors myself, called their bluff.

46:55.563 --> 46:58.148
Sooner or later, they'll forget about me.

46:58.233 --> 46:59.733
I understand.

47:01.569 --> 47:03.237
Have you told Ma?

47:05.740 --> 47:08.826
She's so stubborn, your mother.

47:12.497 --> 47:15.499
Don't worry, I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.543
I'm fighting for us...

47:20.171 --> 47:21.255
Dad?

47:23.758 --> 47:26.176
...since the day we met.

47:26.761 --> 47:29.430
Daddy, out of all those men,

47:29.931 --> 47:32.599
you were the one that took her home,
remember that?

47:32.684 --> 47:34.018
Two hundred men

47:34.102 --> 47:37.604
sitting in that tiny social hall,
watching her dance.

47:40.275 --> 47:43.736
- What was the name of that town?
- Montrichard, Dad.

47:44.571 --> 47:46.780
I didn't speak a word of French,

47:46.865 --> 47:50.451
and six weeks later, she was my wife.

47:51.953 --> 47:53.620
She is your wife.

47:56.082 --> 48:00.461
My son bought me a Cadillac today.
I think that calls for a toast.

48:10.305 --> 48:12.848
To the best damn pilot in the sky.

48:13.933 --> 48:17.061
It's not what you think.
I'm just a copilot.

48:18.813 --> 48:21.440
You see these people staring at you?

48:24.986 --> 48:28.197
These are the most powerful people
in New York City.

48:28.281 --> 48:33.077
They keep peeking over their shoulders,
wondering where you're going tonight.

48:33.161 --> 48:35.037
Where you going, Frank?

48:35.121 --> 48:37.372
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

48:37.832 --> 48:39.583
Some place exotic?

48:41.878 --> 48:44.296
Just tell me where you're going.

48:46.591 --> 48:48.759
Los... Hollywood.

48:49.010 --> 48:50.385
Hollywood?

48:53.223 --> 48:54.556
Come here.

48:56.768 --> 49:00.104
The rest of us
really are suckers.

49:06.361 --> 49:09.154
So I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?

49:09.239 --> 49:10.823
I got a bra out here.

49:10.907 --> 49:13.450
I'm chasing two Puerto Rican guys
through the park.

49:13.535 --> 49:16.120
They got a suitcase
filled with bank robbery loot.

49:16.204 --> 49:18.705
Okay, I'm screaming out,
"F.B.I., freeze!"

49:18.790 --> 49:21.250
I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.

49:21.334 --> 49:23.961
It's so damn big,
I thought I was going to shoot my tits off.

49:27.465 --> 49:30.968
That's a funny story.
People always laugh at that story.

49:31.052 --> 49:32.678
Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Amdursky.

49:32.762 --> 49:36.390
If you had so much fun undercover,
why did you transfer to bank fraud?

49:36.474 --> 49:39.768
I didn't transfer.
I was censured and reassigned.

49:40.353 --> 49:43.856
It's like being punished. I was punished.
I screwed up in the field.

49:43.940 --> 49:46.984
What about you, Mr. Fox, were you
punished for screwing up in the field?

49:47.068 --> 49:49.278
No, I've never worked in the field before.

49:49.362 --> 49:50.904
I audited background investigations

49:50.989 --> 49:53.574
of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.

49:53.658 --> 49:58.162
That's just great. I ask for a team
and they drag the bottom of the Pacific.

49:58.705 --> 50:00.998
Mind if I ask you a question,
Agent Hanratty?

50:01.124 --> 50:02.666
How come you're so serious
all the time?

50:02.750 --> 50:05.335
Does it bother you, Mr. Amdursky?

50:05.420 --> 50:07.462
Yeah, it does bother me.

50:07.797 --> 50:09.673
Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?

50:09.757 --> 50:11.508
A little, I guess.

50:12.552 --> 50:15.304
Would you like to hear me tell a joke?

50:16.598 --> 50:19.558
Yeah, we'd love to hear a joke from you.

50:21.352 --> 50:22.728
Knock, knock.

50:22.812 --> 50:24.271
Who's there?

50:26.941 --> 50:28.734
Go fuck yourselves.

50:42.123 --> 50:44.791
He cashed three checks.
They all cleared.

50:44.876 --> 50:46.960
I was going to deposit this one today.

50:48.880 --> 50:50.964
I don't want any trouble.

50:51.591 --> 50:53.008
No trouble.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.093
No trouble at all.

50:55.178 --> 50:58.305
We'll just take this check
and be on our way. Thank you.

50:58.389 --> 51:00.432
Because I don't want
my customers harassed.

51:03.561 --> 51:06.271
What are you saying? He's still here?

51:07.023 --> 51:08.148
201.

51:10.360 --> 51:11.401
Thank you.

51:12.487 --> 51:14.613
- Corner here.
- Thanks, son.

51:16.491 --> 51:18.283
- Some steps.
- Steps.

51:22.038 --> 51:23.997
Mr. Murphy, how are you?

51:24.082 --> 51:25.666
- Is that Frank?
- Yeah, it's Frank.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.918
- Hey, Frank. How are you?
- How's the knee?

51:28.002 --> 51:30.170
Come on, I'll race you right now.

51:30.255 --> 51:31.964
- Take care.
- Okay, Frank.

51:33.132 --> 51:34.508
Eyeball the back? Come on, Carl.

51:34.592 --> 51:36.468
This guy's a pen-and-ink man,
a goddamn paperhanger.

51:36.552 --> 51:38.387
Why can't we go with you, Carl?

51:38.471 --> 51:43.058
Keep your eyes open, do your job
and I'll buy you both a Good Humor bar.

51:52.819 --> 51:54.987
It's all right, ma'am. F.B.I.

51:57.532 --> 51:59.658
201.

52:11.879 --> 52:13.088
F.B.I.!

52:22.223 --> 52:23.432
F.B.I.

52:24.434 --> 52:26.518
Come out of the bathroom!

52:27.520 --> 52:29.604
Step out of the bathroom!

52:33.526 --> 52:36.236
- Hands on your head.
- That's the new IBM Selectric...

52:36.321 --> 52:38.488
- Put your hands on your head!
- ...print type in five seconds...

52:38.573 --> 52:39.823
Shut up!

52:39.907 --> 52:41.867
Put your hands on your head!

52:41.951 --> 52:45.912
He's got over 200 checks,
a gallon of India ink, drafting...

52:45.997 --> 52:48.332
Even has little payroll envelopes
addressed to himself...

52:48.416 --> 52:50.709
- Put it down! Drop it!
- Relax!

52:51.252 --> 52:53.003
You're late, all right?

52:53.087 --> 52:55.881
My name's Barry Allen,
United States Secret Service.

52:55.965 --> 52:57.591
Your boy just tried
to jump out the window.

52:57.675 --> 53:01.178
- My partner has him in custody.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

53:01.262 --> 53:04.848
You think the F.B.I.
are the only ones on this guy? Come on.

53:04.932 --> 53:07.017
He's dabbling in government checks.

53:07.101 --> 53:10.854
We've been following a paper trail
on this guy for months now.

53:10.938 --> 53:13.273
You mind taking that gun
out of my face?

53:13.358 --> 53:15.359
Please. Really. It makes me nervous.

53:15.485 --> 53:17.152
Let me see some credentials.

53:17.737 --> 53:19.154
Yeah, sure.

53:21.032 --> 53:22.908
Take my whole wallet.

53:23.117 --> 53:26.453
You want my gun, too?
Come over here, take my gun.

53:26.871 --> 53:27.954
Hey. Hey, look.

53:28.039 --> 53:31.333
Just do me a favor, take a look outside.
Look out the window.

53:31.417 --> 53:34.544
My partner's walking him to the car
as we speak. Look.

53:37.465 --> 53:40.342
Old guy almost pissed in his pants
when I came through the door.

53:40.551 --> 53:43.929
He jumped right through the window
onto the hood of my car.

53:44.555 --> 53:45.722
Murph?

53:45.807 --> 53:49.559
Call the LAPD. I don't want
people walking through my crime scene.

53:51.896 --> 53:54.689
I didn't expect
the Secret Service on this.

53:54.816 --> 53:57.651
Don't worry about it.
What's your name?

53:58.194 --> 54:00.612
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.

54:06.202 --> 54:08.787
Mind if I see some identification?

54:09.622 --> 54:12.541
You never can be
too careful these days.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.377
Well, tough luck, Carl.

54:15.461 --> 54:18.088
Five minutes earlier, you would've
landed yourself a pretty good collar.

54:18.172 --> 54:21.091
Is that right? Ten seconds later,
you'd have been shot.

54:22.510 --> 54:25.637
Mind if I come downstairs with you?
I got to take a look at this guy.

54:25.721 --> 54:28.181
Sure thing. Just do me a favor
and sit tight for a sec

54:28.266 --> 54:29.891
while I get this evidence downstairs.

54:29.976 --> 54:33.019
I don't want some maid walking
through here and making the bed.

54:33.104 --> 54:35.689
- LAPD should be here any sec.
- Wait.

54:40.236 --> 54:41.486
Your wallet.

54:42.363 --> 54:45.198
You hang onto it for a minute.
I trust you.

55:04.510 --> 55:06.428
Secret Service.

55:48.262 --> 55:49.387
Hey!

55:50.973 --> 55:52.432
God damn it!

55:53.976 --> 55:56.770
It was stupid. I made a stupid mistake.

55:57.605 --> 55:58.897
Forget about it.

55:58.981 --> 56:01.525
There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.

56:01.609 --> 56:05.862
I can get this guy. The worst thing
a paperhanger can do is show his face.

56:05.947 --> 56:07.280
I read the report.

56:07.365 --> 56:11.034
Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age, 160 pounds.

56:11.118 --> 56:12.702
This could be almost anybody.

56:12.787 --> 56:14.871
I heard his voice. I saw his face.

56:14.956 --> 56:16.915
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

56:18.376 --> 56:19.668
Just be careful.

56:19.877 --> 56:21.795
You got 12 years in.

56:21.879 --> 56:23.588
Nobody bothers you down
on the first floor.

56:23.673 --> 56:25.423
You practically wrote
the book on bank fraud.

56:25.508 --> 56:28.593
That's the kind of thing that can
make you section chief someday.

56:28.678 --> 56:31.972
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

56:32.181 --> 56:33.431
What type of position?

56:35.351 --> 56:37.644
The position of being humiliated.

56:45.903 --> 56:48.697
Sean, would you like to hear me
tell a joke?

56:50.032 --> 56:51.366
Yeah. Sure.

56:52.535 --> 56:54.077
Knock, knock.

56:56.872 --> 57:01.376
My next question is,
when a pilot retires,

57:02.211 --> 57:04.796
Pan Am sends them a check
every single month?

57:04.880 --> 57:07.632
Yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.

57:07.717 --> 57:09.175
How much is that check for?

57:09.594 --> 57:11.261
Kid, I'm really not in the mood
for this right now.

57:11.345 --> 57:13.305
This Skywayman's driving me crazy.

57:13.389 --> 57:14.598
Who's the Skywayman?

57:14.682 --> 57:17.767
Some nut flying around the country,
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

57:17.852 --> 57:20.687
There's a column about him
in the paper today.

57:27.111 --> 57:30.947
I keep telling them it's not my problem.
This guy doesn't even fly Pan Am.

57:31.032 --> 57:34.075
Flies everybody else.
Flies United, TWA,

57:34.201 --> 57:35.869
Continental, Eastern.

57:36.203 --> 57:37.912
The Skywayman.

57:38.414 --> 57:40.582
Newspaper loves this clown.

57:41.417 --> 57:43.543
They call him the James Bond
of the sky.

57:46.547 --> 57:47.547
Did you say...

57:47.632 --> 57:49.257
Bond, James Bond.

57:58.934 --> 58:01.436
Tell me, Joan,
why does he do it?

58:01.562 --> 58:03.063
He likes to win.

58:03.481 --> 58:05.440
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

58:05.566 --> 58:08.360
Do you want to play it easy,
or the hard way?

58:08.444 --> 58:10.153
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

58:10.237 --> 58:13.281
Pussy, you know a lot more
about planes than guns.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.492
Hello, Pussy.

58:16.410 --> 58:18.370
You're sure this is the suit, right?

58:18.454 --> 58:19.621
Positive.

58:19.789 --> 58:21.831
It's the exact suit he wore in the movie.

58:21.916 --> 58:24.167
Okay. I'll take three.

58:24.251 --> 58:25.960
Certainly, Mr. Fleming.

58:26.087 --> 58:30.298
Now all you need is one of those
little foreign sports cars that he drives.

58:57.910 --> 58:59.452
- Hello.
- Hi.

59:03.332 --> 59:05.250
Haven't I seen you before?

59:07.795 --> 59:09.087
Maybe.

59:09.630 --> 59:12.799
A couple of years ago,
I was on the cover of Seventeen.

59:15.094 --> 59:17.595
You're that model, right? Cheryl.

59:18.597 --> 59:21.474
Guys used to put your picture
on their lockers.

59:23.269 --> 59:26.146
Isn't that your silver car
I saw parked out front?

59:26.439 --> 59:28.648
Yeah. One of them.

59:32.987 --> 59:35.613
So, think I could get an autograph?

59:39.994 --> 59:41.995
Do you have a pen in your room?

01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:18.031
Shh.

01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:23.536
A man like you can buy
anything he wants.

01:00:35.216 --> 01:00:38.384
He buys a deck of cards
at the hotel gift shop.

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:43.556
You want to see a card trick?

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:47.185
How much did these cards cost?

01:00:49.021 --> 01:00:51.397
I don't know, 55 cents, I think.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:58.738
And if they sold me downstairs
at the hotel gift shop,

01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:02.742
how much would you pay?

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:08.540
I'm sorry, how much would
I pay for what?

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.086
The entire night.

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:18.591
How much would you pay me
for the entire night?

01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:25.932
Cheryl, I really don't know.

01:01:28.102 --> 01:01:29.769
Don't be scared.

01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:35.984
Make me an offer.

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:45.118
300?

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:47.954
Go fish.

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.459
$500?

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.461
Go fish.

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:58.256
600.

01:02:00.134 --> 01:02:01.426
Go fish!

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.097
$1,000.

01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:09.809
Okay.

01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.646
$1,000.

01:02:15.316 --> 01:02:16.649
Okay.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:19.027
I'll be right back.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.446
Wait a second, where are you going?

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.990
I'm going downstairs to cash a check.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.828
You think this hotel is going to cash
a $1,000 check at 3:00 a.m.?

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:35.668
It's a New York Savings and Loan
check. It's like gold. They'll cash it.

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:39.547
Don't you think they might get
a little suspicious? Let me see that.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.761
It's a cashier's check.
Endorse it over to me.

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:46.346
I couldn't do that.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.849
This check is for 1,400.
We agreed upon 1,000.

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:54.020
Why don't I give you back 400

01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:56.981
and you give me that check?

01:02:58.317 --> 01:02:59.692
Even better.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.685
Does this belong to anybody?

01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:52.245
This is Hanratty. Merry Christmas.

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:53.746
Hello, Carl.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.665
Hello.

01:03:57.918 --> 01:04:00.253
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:05.008
I've been trying to track you down now
for the last couple of hours.

01:04:05.134 --> 01:04:06.259
What do you want?

01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:10.763
I wanted to apologize
for what happened out in Los Angeles.

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.015
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

01:04:12.099 --> 01:04:14.267
No, you don't apologize to me.

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:17.228
Do you always work
on Christmas Eve, Carl?

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.522
I volunteered

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:21.733
so the men with families
could go home early.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:24.819
Looked like you were wearing
a wedding ring out in Los Angeles.

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:26.696
I thought maybe you had a family.

01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:28.531
No. No family.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.995
You want to talk to me?
Let's talk face to face.

01:04:34.288 --> 01:04:35.580
All right.

01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:39.333
I'm at my suite
at the Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:42.920
In the morning, I leave for Las Vegas
for the weekend.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.633
You think you're going to get me again?

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.888
You're not going to Vegas,
you're not in the Stuyvesant Arms.

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:57.935
You'd love for me to send out 20 agents,
Christmas Eve, barge into your hotel,

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.605
knock down the door
so you can make fools out of us all.

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:04.609
I'm really sorry if I made a fool
out of you. I really am.

01:05:04.693 --> 01:05:06.027
Uh-uh. No.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:09.113
No. You do not feel sorry for me.

01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:13.826
The truth is, I knew it was you.
I didn't get the cuffs on you, but I knew.

01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:17.830
People only know
what you tell them, Carl.

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:21.959
Then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

01:05:22.503 --> 01:05:25.254
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:28.341
The same reason
the Yankees always win.

01:05:28.467 --> 01:05:31.594
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:34.514
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.849
No one ever bets on the uniform.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.644
You sure about that, Carl?

01:05:39.812 --> 01:05:42.021
I'll tell you what I am sure of.

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:44.023
You're going to get caught.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:48.319
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact. It's like Vegas.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.196
The house always wins.

01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:59.163
Well, Carl, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:03.292
You didn't call just to apologize,
did you?

01:06:04.545 --> 01:06:05.795
What do you mean?

01:06:07.548 --> 01:06:09.590
You have no one else to call.

01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:13.219
Whoa!

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:48.629
More coffee, sir?

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:57.763
- Are you a collector?
- Of what?

01:06:57.848 --> 01:06:59.182
Captives of the Cosmic Ray,

01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:01.225
The Big Freeze,
Land of the Golden Giants.

01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:03.936
- I've got them all.
- What are you talking about?

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:05.938
Barry Allen.

01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:10.151
The Flash.

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:13.779
Wait, kid.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:17.992
You mean, like the comic book?

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:21.120
Yeah, the comic book. When he's not
The Flash, that's his name, Barry Allen.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.332
Thank you.

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:31.088
Now get this, he reads comic books!

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:33.883
Comic books! Barry Allen is The Flash!

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:36.219
Carl, slow down. I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:38.221
He's a kid. Our unsub is a kid.

01:07:38.305 --> 01:07:41.224
That's why we couldn't match his prints,
that's why he doesn't have a record.

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:43.392
I want you to contact NYPD for every

01:07:43.477 --> 01:07:46.270
all-points juvenile runaways
in New York City.

01:07:46.355 --> 01:07:49.774
Don't forget the airports. He's been
kiting checks all over the country.

01:07:49.858 --> 01:07:51.943
- Why New York?
- The Yankees!

01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:54.487
He said something about the Yankees!

01:07:57.032 --> 01:07:58.491
Where are we on the list?

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:01.118
Number 53, Abagnale.

01:08:04.373 --> 01:08:06.958
Good morning, ma'am,
we're the F.B.I. agents who called.

01:08:07.042 --> 01:08:08.167
Yes, I've been waiting.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:11.837
I hope you're all hungry.
I put out the Sara Lee.

01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:17.260
My husband, Jack, is a lawyer.

01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:19.970
What about your first husband,
Mrs. Abagnale?

01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:23.683
Abagnale. But I prefer
to be called Barnes.

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:28.770
"Frank William Abagnale."
It says he was in the service.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:30.939
Did you two meet during the war?

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:35.736
Yeah, I lived in a very small village
in France, Montrichard.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:39.657
The kind of place
where they never heard of Sara Lee.

01:08:40.075 --> 01:08:41.617
Help yourselves.

01:08:41.702 --> 01:08:43.536
Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.121
You filled out a missing person's report

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:48.666
for a runaway juvenile by the name of
Frank Abagnale, Jr.

01:08:49.209 --> 01:08:50.459
Is Frankie okay?

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:52.962
You're aware of the fact that
he wrote some checks

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:55.256
on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.801
Yes. The police think
he's some type of criminal.

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.345
What he did was a felony, Mrs. Barnes.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.514
It was $1,000.

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:08.102
Half the kids his age are on dope,
throwing rocks at police.

01:09:08.854 --> 01:09:13.064
And they scared me to death
because my son made a little mistake.

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:17.111
A 17-year-old boy has to eat,

01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:19.238
has to have a place to sleep.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.365
We understand, ma'am.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.576
Would you happen to have a picture
of your son?

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.578
Yes, I have his old yearbook.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:36.339
Okay.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.344
We need to send out
an all-office teletype.

01:09:41.428 --> 01:09:44.930
Our unsub's name
is Frank Abagnale, Jr., age 17!

01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:47.265
Is Frankie okay? Is he in trouble?

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.227
Ma'am, I'm sorry to have to tell you,
your son is forging checks.

01:09:50.312 --> 01:09:53.314
Forging checks? Wait!
I'm sure we can take care of that.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:55.399
I'm working part-time at the church now.

01:09:55.484 --> 01:09:57.985
Just tell me how much he owes
and I'll pay you back.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.404
So far, it's about $1 .3 million.

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:19.548
Hi, Melanie, how are you?

01:10:19.633 --> 01:10:22.134
When you're in the house,
please use an ashtray.

01:10:22.219 --> 01:10:23.969
Frank, this fondue is so good!

01:10:24.054 --> 01:10:26.931
- Great. Take this.
- Good, I love Moët!

01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:39.485
James, please! Stay away
from the hi-fi system, all right?

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:42.488
It's a reel-to-reel,
you can't wind it like that.

01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:48.577
Christ, Terry! This is Italian knit!

01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:51.288
- Watch where you're going!
- It's just a shirt, man!

01:10:51.373 --> 01:10:53.374
Frank! Come quick!

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:57.294
Lance just fell into the conversation pit!

01:11:02.843 --> 01:11:05.428
Excuse me,
you know where Lance Applebaum is?

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:06.637
Thank you.

01:11:07.639 --> 01:11:09.849
These bottles need to be
labeled when you pick them up!

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:12.226
Do you understand
how dangerous this is? Do you?

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:15.563
Don't stand there crying. Nod your head.
Tell me you won't do it again.

01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:17.773
Now dry up and get back to work.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:25.364
You okay?

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:28.826
He told me to pick up the blood, so I did.

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.078
But he never told me to label it.

01:11:32.456 --> 01:11:34.457
It's okay, stop crying.

01:11:34.875 --> 01:11:36.292
What's your name?

01:11:37.252 --> 01:11:38.544
Brenda.

01:11:41.173 --> 01:11:43.340
Brenda, I wouldn't worry about it.

01:11:43.425 --> 01:11:45.843
These doctors don't know everything.

01:11:46.595 --> 01:11:48.387
It's my first week.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.514
I think they're going to fire me.

01:11:50.599 --> 01:11:53.517
No, nobody's going to fire you, Brenda.

01:11:53.894 --> 01:11:55.895
I bet you're good at your job.

01:11:57.022 --> 01:11:58.522
No, I'm not.

01:11:59.566 --> 01:12:01.984
I bet if I asked you to check
on the status

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.777
of my friend Lance Applebaum,

01:12:04.613 --> 01:12:07.323
you could do that for me in a second.

01:12:14.873 --> 01:12:17.750
Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:21.545
Dr. Ashland is treating him
in exam room seven.

01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:24.089
You see that? No problem.

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.552
This is the emergency chart.

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:33.015
See that blue star? That means
the patient has been diagnosed.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:37.561
And then after he's been treated,
we put a red circle here. See?

01:12:38.897 --> 01:12:41.190
How do you like those braces?

01:12:42.651 --> 01:12:44.235
I guess they're all right.

01:12:44.945 --> 01:12:47.071
I got mine off last year.

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.616
Boy, I hated them. They were bottoms.

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:53.035
I still got to wear my mouth guard.

01:12:53.912 --> 01:12:55.746
You have really nice teeth.

01:12:57.541 --> 01:12:59.250
Well, thank you.

01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:01.877
And you have a pretty smile.

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:09.343
No, I mean it. I really think
those braces look good on you.

01:13:09.553 --> 01:13:10.970
Thank you.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:12.471
You're welcome.

01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:17.184
Brenda.

01:13:17.477 --> 01:13:18.686
Yeah.

01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:21.647
Do you know if they're hiring here
at the hospital?

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:25.859
I'm not sure. What do you want to do?

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.363
I'm a doctor.

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:34.827
Dear Dad,

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:37.621
I decided to get off the road for a while.

01:13:37.706 --> 01:13:41.625
I've taken a night job at a hospital
and met some really nice people.

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:43.419
Feels good to have
my feet on the ground,

01:13:43.503 --> 01:13:45.671
to wake up in the same bed every night.

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:50.843
Who knows, maybe I'll even find
someone to settle down with.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.765
"Harvard Medical School."
Top of your class.

01:13:57.851 --> 01:14:00.603
"Southern California
Children's Hospital."

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:04.440
That is a pretty impressive résumé,
Dr. Conners.

01:14:04.733 --> 01:14:06.400
Unfortunately,

01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:09.111
the only thing I need is

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:13.490
an emergency room supervisor
for my midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift.

01:14:14.743 --> 01:14:17.870
Someone to babysit
six interns and 20 nurses.

01:14:18.872 --> 01:14:20.372
But...

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:25.377
Hell, I doubt that you'd be interested
in that.

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:31.383
In the past, they've always
let me choose my own nurses.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:34.219
Dr. Connelly.

01:14:35.722 --> 01:14:37.306
- Dr. Harris.
- Present.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:39.558
Dr. Ashland.

01:14:39.643 --> 01:14:41.060
Dr. Conners?

01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:43.729
You gonna take roll every night?

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.773
Yes, I will, Dr. Ashland.

01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:49.193
And if you're going to be late,
I suggest you bring a note.

01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:54.239
Miss Basmann.

01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:56.158
Miss Mace.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.327
Miss Strong.

01:14:58.578 --> 01:14:59.662
Here.

01:14:59.746 --> 01:15:01.080
Nurse Brown.

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:03.582
Nurse Sanford.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.543
Thirty milligrams
of codeine every four hours.

01:15:06.628 --> 01:15:10.464
Run the plasma at 60 drops a minute
till we calculate the fluid requirements.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:14.134
What do you estimate the degree
and extent of the burns, Kildare?

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:17.429
Second and third-degree burns
over about 20% of the body surface.

01:15:17.514 --> 01:15:21.016
- Do you concur?
- I concur. Let's get him up to Pediatrics.

01:15:27.691 --> 01:15:28.774
Hello, Brenda.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:30.275
Hi, Dr. Conners.

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:33.529
- You need to sign these.
- Thank you.

01:15:40.704 --> 01:15:42.663
Do you notice anything different
about me?

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:44.915
You got your braces off! Come here.

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:47.501
I've been trying to show you all night!

01:15:48.837 --> 01:15:49.837
Wow.

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:51.547
Good job.

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:54.466
Did it hurt when they took them off?
Mine felt so weird after.

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:57.469
I keep rubbing my tongue over them.
I can't stop!

01:15:57.679 --> 01:15:59.054
They're so slippery.

01:15:59.139 --> 01:16:02.307
- It feels good, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it feels incredible.

01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:13.902
Oh, my!

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:16.655
I'm sorry.

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:31.795
Dr. Conners to the E.R.
Dr. Conners to the E.R.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.005
Shouldn't you go?

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:37.718
No. They have a staff doctor
in the emergency ward, we'll be fine.

01:16:44.017 --> 01:16:45.934
What if he's in surgery?

01:16:47.854 --> 01:16:49.438
Do you really think I have to go?

01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:51.774
In here, Dr. Conners.

01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:12.377
Gentlemen, what seems
to be the problem?

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:17.633
Bicycle accident. A fractured tibia
about five inches below the patella.

01:17:18.218 --> 01:17:19.343
Hmm.

01:17:22.764 --> 01:17:24.223
Dr. Harris.

01:17:24.808 --> 01:17:26.391
Do you concur?

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.977
Concur with what, sir?

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:32.815
With what Dr. Ashland just said.
Do you concur?

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:37.903
Well, it was a bicycle accident.
The boy told us.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:40.280
So you concur?

01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:45.619
We should take an X-ray, stitch him up
and put him in a walking cast.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:51.375
Very good, Dr. Ashland. Very good.

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:54.419
Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.

01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:55.754
Carry on.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:59.967
I blew it, didn't I?

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.594
Why didn't I concur?

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:26.326
Make yourself at home!

01:18:27.662 --> 01:18:29.162
Frank Abagnale, Sr.

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.039
You're not a cop.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.793
Special Agent Hanratty, F.B.I.

01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:38.505
You're not a cop.
My landlord said you were not a cop.

01:18:38.965 --> 01:18:42.593
If you're going to arrest me,
I'd like to put on a different suit.

01:18:42.677 --> 01:18:44.970
- If that's okay...
- I'm not here to arrest you.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.347
I'm looking for your son. He's in trouble.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.141
Do you know where he is?

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:54.938
If I tell you where he is,
will you promise not to tell his mother?

01:18:55.023 --> 01:18:56.106
Sure.

01:18:57.317 --> 01:19:01.403
Frank made up a fake I.D.
and enlisted in the Marine Corps.

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:03.572
He's over in Vietnam right now.

01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:05.741
That kid is halfway around the world,

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:09.870
crawling through the damn jungle,
fighting the communists, so...

01:19:11.331 --> 01:19:15.334
Please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal...

01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:19.338
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr. Abagnale. I said he was in trouble.

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:24.134
If you'd like to give me a call and talk,
here's my number.

01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:38.523
You're not a father, are you?

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:41.735
Pardon me?

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:44.154
If you were a father, you'd know.

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:49.701
I would never give up my son.
I would never give up my son.

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:53.747
Yes, sir. I understand.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:56.541
Sean, now get this.

01:19:57.043 --> 01:20:01.713
"Riverbend Apartments, 415 Landover,
Atlanta, Georgia."

01:20:02.173 --> 01:20:03.840
Atlanta, Georgia.

01:20:03.925 --> 01:20:08.637
I'm on my way to the airport. I'll meet
the team in four hours. Bye-bye!

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.141
Come on, it's okay.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.727
You don't have to cry.

01:20:16.062 --> 01:20:20.482
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Frank!
I can't do this.

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:22.234
Brenda, listen to me.

01:20:23.236 --> 01:20:25.362
I don't care if you're a virgin, all right?

01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:26.697
Really, I can wait.

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:29.616
I'm not a virgin.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.498
I had an abortion two years ago.

01:20:40.086 --> 01:20:42.587
My parents had a friend do it.

01:20:43.089 --> 01:20:46.299
A man that my father plays golf with.

01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:51.013
And when I got better,
they kicked me out of the house.

01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:55.475
I had an abortion
and I wasn't their daughter anymore!

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.271
I'm so sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.107
No, no.

01:21:02.275 --> 01:21:04.443
- Please don't be mad at me.
- Shh.

01:21:06.446 --> 01:21:08.947
What if I spoke to your parents?

01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:11.283
Maybe I can straighten things out.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:14.953
I ask them all the time,
but they said I still can't come home.

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:18.957
And my daddy's a lawyer.

01:21:27.341 --> 01:21:28.508
Brenda?

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:33.847
What if you were engaged to a doctor?

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:36.391
Would that change anything?

01:21:36.476 --> 01:21:37.726
What?

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:44.024
What if I went to your parents,

01:21:45.485 --> 01:21:47.819
and I spoke to your father

01:21:51.074 --> 01:21:53.700
and I asked permission to marry you?

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.841
- It's empty.
- Nobody here.

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:36.201
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:39.454
Yes, I am a Lutheran.

01:22:39.539 --> 01:22:41.706
But please, call me Frank.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:45.710
Frank, would you like to say grace?

01:22:51.217 --> 01:22:53.552
Unless you're not comfortable.

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:55.303
Absolutely.

01:23:05.815 --> 01:23:08.900
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:12.821
The first mouse
quickly gave up and drowned,

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:14.739
but the second mouse struggled so hard

01:23:14.824 --> 01:23:17.450
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter,

01:23:18.244 --> 01:23:19.703
and he walked out.

01:23:21.247 --> 01:23:22.247
Amen.

01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:26.918
That was beautiful.

01:23:27.253 --> 01:23:29.588
The mouse churned
that cream into butter.

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:33.967
That's right.

01:23:35.303 --> 01:23:36.720
Thank you.

01:23:36.804 --> 01:23:39.931
Frank, have you decided which hospital
you want to work at in New Orleans?

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:45.562
To be quite honest,
I'm thinking about getting back into law.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:49.107
Oh, my! Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:53.361
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.

01:23:53.446 --> 01:23:56.198
I practiced law for one year,
then I decided,

01:23:56.449 --> 01:23:58.992
why not try my hand at pediatrics?

01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:02.329
You're just full of surprises.

01:24:03.289 --> 01:24:04.497
Yeah.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:08.877
A doctor and a lawyer.
Brenda hit the jackpot.

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:11.338
Where did you go to law school?

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:13.215
Berkeley.

01:24:15.718 --> 01:24:17.677
Oh, my gosh.
Isn't that where you went, Daddy?

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:19.429
Maybe Frank could come
work for you, Roger.

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:22.766
You're always saying how hard it is
to find assistant prosecutors.

01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:25.894
Could he, Daddy? Could he, please?
Could he come work with you, please?

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.562
Was that snake Hollingsworth

01:24:27.647 --> 01:24:30.232
still teaching there
when you went through Berkeley?

01:24:32.068 --> 01:24:33.068
Hollingsworth.

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:35.487
Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth, right?

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.322
Meaner than ever.

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:39.699
And that dog of his?

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:46.039
Tell me, Frank,
what was the name of his little dog?

01:24:55.675 --> 01:24:57.092
I'm sorry.

01:24:58.928 --> 01:25:00.470
The dog was dead.

01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:01.846
Oh.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:05.350
How unfortunate.

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:07.852
Yeah.

01:25:38.217 --> 01:25:40.719
A doctor, a lawyer, a Lutheran.

01:25:43.556 --> 01:25:45.640
So, what are you, Frank?

01:25:46.559 --> 01:25:49.936
'Cause I think you're about to ask
for my daughter's hand in marriage,

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.521
and I have a right to know.

01:25:52.106 --> 01:25:53.732
Know what, sir?

01:25:54.317 --> 01:25:55.734
The truth.

01:25:57.903 --> 01:25:59.946
Tell me the truth, Frank.

01:26:01.324 --> 01:26:03.408
What are you doing here?

01:26:05.161 --> 01:26:08.079
What is a man like you
doing with Brenda?

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:13.126
If you want my blessing,
if you want my daughter,

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:15.670
I'd like to hear it from you now.

01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:20.175
The truth is, sir...

01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:26.264
The truth is that...

01:26:28.768 --> 01:26:31.311
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a lawyer.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:35.982
I'm not an airline pilot.

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:39.778
I'm nothing, really.

01:26:46.994 --> 01:26:50.121
I'm just a kid
who's in love with your daughter.

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:53.500
No.

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:04.969
You know what you are?

01:27:05.304 --> 01:27:07.055
You're a romantic.

01:27:07.181 --> 01:27:10.183
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.

01:27:10.309 --> 01:27:13.895
I must confess,
I'm guilty of the same foolish whimsy.

01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:16.106
I proposed to Carol after five dates

01:27:16.190 --> 01:27:18.983
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes

01:27:19.068 --> 01:27:20.985
because I knew she was the one.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:23.738
So go ahead, Frank.

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:29.327
Don't be afraid.

01:27:29.537 --> 01:27:32.497
Ask the question you came here
to ask me.

01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:41.172
What would I have to do to take the bar
here in New Orleans?

01:27:46.095 --> 01:27:48.096
No, the other question.

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:55.353
Right through that door.

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:59.232
Good luck, Mr. Conners.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.109
Thank you.

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:10.618
Hey, Frank.

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:13.413
You know what I could never figure out?

01:28:13.539 --> 01:28:16.332
How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?

01:28:16.417 --> 01:28:18.042
What's the difference?

01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:22.130
- Someone took the test for you?
- I'm going to prison for a long time.

01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:25.091
Seriously, what's the difference?

01:28:25.468 --> 01:28:27.469
It's a simple question.

01:28:28.554 --> 01:28:31.055
Are you going to eat that éclair?

01:28:32.725 --> 01:28:35.393
Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

01:28:36.437 --> 01:28:38.438
Or you want to split it with me?

01:28:38.564 --> 01:28:39.606
No.

01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:45.737
Give me half that éclair and I'll tell you.

01:28:56.582 --> 01:28:59.167
I'm gonna figure it out sooner or later.

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:09.344
You'll be working under Phillip Rigby
in corporate law.

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:12.764
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?

01:29:15.434 --> 01:29:17.435
We're having lunch at 12:30

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.898
with the Attorney General
and Governor McKeithen himself.

01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:23.608
A governor!

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:25.318
Did we spell it right?

01:29:25.444 --> 01:29:26.694
You sure did.

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:28.530
Congratulations.

01:29:28.614 --> 01:29:30.865
- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome aboard.

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:40.959
Look at this photograph, Mr. Stewart.

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:45.296
It's a photograph of Prentice York,
where they found him, dead.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:48.633
Here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:52.637
This is a photograph of the defendant's
signature on a canceled check.

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:56.641
Here is an enlargement of that
same signature, which matches

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:59.894
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon,

01:29:59.979 --> 01:30:04.190
which discuss the possibility of
defrauding the great state of Louisiana.

01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:07.151
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:30:07.236 --> 01:30:11.531
this is irrefutable evidence
that the defendant is, in fact, lying.

01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:21.457
Mr. Conners,
this is a preliminary hearing.

01:30:22.251 --> 01:30:24.836
There is no defendant.

01:30:26.839 --> 01:30:29.716
There is no jury.

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:32.760
It's just me.

01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:35.263
Son,

01:30:35.514 --> 01:30:38.099
what in the hell is wrong with you?

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.853
Is that Mitch? Roger!

01:30:42.688 --> 01:30:43.938
It's Mitch!

01:30:44.106 --> 01:30:45.940
I lost all track of time.

01:30:46.025 --> 01:30:48.359
As studio guests
for the sing-along tonight,

01:30:48.444 --> 01:30:49.485
we have the children's choir

01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:51.946
of Saint Monica's Church
in New York City.

01:30:52.031 --> 01:30:56.117
Won't you join them and the gang
in a few songs for the Irish? Everybody!

01:32:26.959 --> 01:32:28.084
Dad?

01:32:32.464 --> 01:32:34.215
What are you doing here?

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:37.969
I came to see you.

01:32:42.141 --> 01:32:44.058
What are you doing dressed like this?

01:32:44.143 --> 01:32:46.102
I took a government job.

01:32:46.228 --> 01:32:49.605
You see what I'm doing?
Do you have a good lawyer?

01:32:50.858 --> 01:32:52.358
I sort of am a lawyer now.

01:32:52.443 --> 01:32:54.986
Look at this letter. The IRS wants more.

01:32:55.946 --> 01:32:58.489
I had a deal with them. Two penalties.

01:32:58.574 --> 01:33:01.242
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

01:33:01.952 --> 01:33:03.578
I want to sue them.

01:33:04.747 --> 01:33:06.831
Now they want the crumbs.

01:33:08.584 --> 01:33:09.834
Sit down.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:13.171
They're trying to scare me,
intimidate me. You know what?

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.215
You know what?

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.342
I'll make them chase me

01:33:18.927 --> 01:33:21.179
for the rest of their lives!

01:33:28.145 --> 01:33:30.229
It's great to see you, Daddy.

01:33:32.065 --> 01:33:34.484
Sit down, I want to show you something.

01:33:36.904 --> 01:33:39.197
I came here to give you this.

01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:42.241
It's an invitation to an engagement party.

01:33:44.995 --> 01:33:47.205
Daddy, I'm getting married.

01:33:47.998 --> 01:33:50.208
Can you believe that
I'm getting married?

01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:53.586
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad. Listen.

01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:57.298
I'm getting a brand-new Cadillac,
I'm getting a $60,000 house,

01:33:57.382 --> 01:33:59.091
I'm getting it all back.

01:33:59.218 --> 01:34:03.971
All the jewelry, the furs, everything
they took from us, I'll get it back.

01:34:07.351 --> 01:34:09.310
Has Ma seen you dressed like this?

01:34:10.896 --> 01:34:13.105
Yeah, she came to pick up some boxes.

01:34:13.524 --> 01:34:15.316
That's okay. You know why?

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.735
Because she's going to the wedding
with us.

01:34:17.861 --> 01:34:20.196
I'm gonna get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:23.157
One of those Manhattan Eagle,
three-button black pearl suits.

01:34:23.242 --> 01:34:24.325
You'll look great.

01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:26.911
Those are nice. She won't see me.

01:34:29.456 --> 01:34:31.666
Have you tried to call her?

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:35.962
Why don't you call her right now?

01:34:36.338 --> 01:34:38.256
Why don't you call her right now?

01:34:38.549 --> 01:34:40.049
Dad, just call her.

01:34:40.133 --> 01:34:41.676
Call her for me.

01:34:41.927 --> 01:34:45.638
Tell her I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:47.598
You mother's married now
to my friend, Jack Barnes.

01:34:47.683 --> 01:34:50.434
They have a house in Long Island.

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:54.272
I had an F.B.I. agent come see me.

01:34:55.524 --> 01:34:58.818
You got their number, son.
The guy looked scared.

01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:03.155
The United States Government, champ,
running for the hills.

01:35:04.199 --> 01:35:05.575
Pow! To the moon!

01:35:17.045 --> 01:35:18.045
Dad.

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:20.631
It's over.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.175
I'm going to stop now.

01:35:26.346 --> 01:35:28.139
They're never gonna catch you, Frank.

01:35:28.223 --> 01:35:31.684
She wouldn't do that!
Why would she do that to you?

01:35:31.852 --> 01:35:34.770
Come on. Sit with me. Have a drink.
I'm your father.

01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:40.443
Then ask me to stop.
Then ask me to stop.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.364
You can't stop.

01:35:47.951 --> 01:35:49.952
Where are you going?

01:35:50.037 --> 01:35:52.371
Come on, Frank, where are you going?

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:55.082
Where are you going?
Where are you going tonight?

01:35:55.417 --> 01:35:56.792
Someplace exotic?

01:35:56.877 --> 01:35:59.503
Where are you going tonight?
Tahiti? Hawaii?

01:36:16.897 --> 01:36:18.606
This is Hanratty.

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:21.400
Hello, Carl.

01:36:21.985 --> 01:36:23.486
Merry Christmas.

01:36:23.987 --> 01:36:25.863
How are you, Dr. Conners?

01:36:26.365 --> 01:36:29.492
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.

01:36:32.913 --> 01:36:34.121
Well,

01:36:34.414 --> 01:36:37.166
I'm sitting here in my office
on Christmas Eve.

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:39.627
What do you want?

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:46.342
Okay.

01:36:50.889 --> 01:36:52.765
I want it to be over.

01:36:57.396 --> 01:37:00.231
I want it to be over. I'm getting married.

01:37:00.774 --> 01:37:02.400
I'm settling down.

01:37:02.484 --> 01:37:04.735
You've stolen almost $4 million.

01:37:04.987 --> 01:37:07.279
You think we could call it
a wedding present?

01:37:07.364 --> 01:37:09.657
This isn't something
you get to walk away from, Frank.

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:12.118
- I want to call a truce.
- No truce.

01:37:12.202 --> 01:37:15.830
You will be caught, you will go to prison.
Where did you think this was going?

01:37:16.373 --> 01:37:18.708
Please leave me alone, Carl.

01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:20.584
Please?

01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:23.254
I'm getting close, aren't I?

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:25.965
You're scared because
I'm getting close. I know

01:37:26.049 --> 01:37:30.261
you rented a car in Shreveport,
stayed in a hotel on Lake Charles.

01:37:31.263 --> 01:37:33.139
You want to run, be my guest.

01:37:33.223 --> 01:37:35.850
Your checks don't lie as well as you do.

01:37:35.934 --> 01:37:37.601
Stop chasing me.

01:37:40.772 --> 01:37:42.273
I can't stop.

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:44.984
It's my job.

01:37:46.236 --> 01:37:47.945
It's okay, Carl.

01:37:50.115 --> 01:37:52.158
I just thought I'd ask.

01:37:54.494 --> 01:37:55.494
Hey.

01:37:56.747 --> 01:37:58.247
Merry Christmas.

01:38:01.793 --> 01:38:03.377
I love my job.

01:38:04.796 --> 01:38:06.172
All right.

01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:09.800
Let's get every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.

01:38:09.885 --> 01:38:11.343
What're we looking for?

01:38:11.428 --> 01:38:13.971
Engagement announcements.
Name of Conners.

01:38:14.556 --> 01:38:17.558
Come on, the kid
would have changed his name by now.

01:38:17.642 --> 01:38:20.311
Uh-uh. He can't change it.

01:38:20.687 --> 01:38:22.354
She thinks he's Conners.

01:38:22.439 --> 01:38:24.940
If he loses the name, he loses the girl.

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.787
- Congratulations!
- Having a good time?

01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:43.667
Keep dancing.

01:38:46.505 --> 01:38:48.172
Look who's here.

01:38:49.674 --> 01:38:51.967
I'm going to the little boys' room.

01:38:52.552 --> 01:38:53.969
Hurry back.

01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:12.363
Good evening.
I'm Agent Hanratty with the F.B.I.

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:14.782
We'd like to have a few kind words
with your host, if possible.

01:39:14.866 --> 01:39:16.158
I'll get him.

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.538
Right over there, sir.

01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:24.708
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.

01:39:24.793 --> 01:39:28.295
Carl Hanratty, F.B.I.
These are Agents Amdursky and Fox.

01:39:29.339 --> 01:39:32.883
- Sorry to crash your party, sir.
- Not at all. What can I do for you?

01:39:32.968 --> 01:39:36.345
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to meet the groom.

01:39:36.429 --> 01:39:38.222
Is there a problem?

01:39:40.809 --> 01:39:43.394
Frank! Can you hold all these?

01:39:43.478 --> 01:39:45.437
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

01:39:45.522 --> 01:39:47.815
They're for us so
we can start our new life...

01:39:47.899 --> 01:39:50.484
What are you doing? What's wrong?

01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:52.361
We have to leave.

01:39:55.198 --> 01:39:56.699
You love me, right?

01:39:56.908 --> 01:39:59.243
I mean, you'd love me no matter what.

01:39:59.411 --> 01:40:03.247
You'd love me whether I was sick
or poor, or if I had a different name.

01:40:03.331 --> 01:40:04.790
Frank, where did you get
all that money?

01:40:04.916 --> 01:40:08.127
Brenda, listen. A name doesn't matter.

01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:09.545
My name is Frank Conners.

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:12.256
That's who I am with you.
But we all have secrets.

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:14.550
Sometimes when I travel,
I use the name Frank Taylor.

01:40:14.634 --> 01:40:16.302
That's my secret.

01:40:16.386 --> 01:40:20.264
Frank Taylor, you know.
Frank Black. It doesn't matter.

01:40:20.891 --> 01:40:22.474
Why are you saying all this?

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.562
Brenda, I don't want to lie
to you anymore.

01:40:26.646 --> 01:40:28.981
I'm not a doctor,
I never went to medical school.

01:40:29.065 --> 01:40:32.359
I'm not a lawyer, or a Harvard graduate
or a Lutheran.

01:40:32.444 --> 01:40:36.197
I ran away from home
a year and a half ago when I was 16.

01:40:39.326 --> 01:40:40.326
Frank.

01:40:41.703 --> 01:40:43.621
You're not a Lutheran?

01:40:44.789 --> 01:40:47.625
You see all this money? I have more.

01:40:48.168 --> 01:40:50.002
I have plenty more.

01:40:50.795 --> 01:40:54.465
I have enough money to last us
for the rest of our lives. Look.

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:57.301
Frank, stop teasing me!

01:40:57.677 --> 01:41:01.096
You're Frank Conners
and you're 28 years old...

01:41:03.308 --> 01:41:05.142
Why would you lie to me?

01:41:05.352 --> 01:41:06.352
Brenda.

01:41:06.603 --> 01:41:09.396
I want to know your name.
Tell me your name.

01:41:09.481 --> 01:41:12.858
We can live anywhere we want.
But you have to trust me.

01:41:12.943 --> 01:41:15.778
Do you trust me?
Do you love me, Brenda?

01:41:15.862 --> 01:41:17.321
Yes. I love you.

01:41:18.031 --> 01:41:19.615
Excuse me, Mother.

01:41:20.242 --> 01:41:22.952
This is Mr. Hanratty. My wife, Carol.

01:41:23.036 --> 01:41:24.995
- Mister...
- Hanratty, ma'am.

01:41:25.288 --> 01:41:27.122
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?

01:41:27.207 --> 01:41:29.166
I think they went upstairs.

01:41:38.885 --> 01:41:40.052
Come here.

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.348
In two days,
meet me at Miami International Airport.

01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:48.102
Leave the house after your parents
go to sleep. Take a taxicab.

01:41:48.186 --> 01:41:51.814
Give the taxi driver this money.
Tell him to drive all through the night.

01:41:51.898 --> 01:41:53.774
You're gonna leave at 10:00 a.m.

01:41:53.858 --> 01:41:55.317
10:00 a.m. All right?

01:42:15.005 --> 01:42:17.214
- Which room, sir?
- In the corner.

01:42:17.716 --> 01:42:21.885
You have to listen. The International
Terminal in Miami. Say it.

01:42:22.012 --> 01:42:26.140
No matter what, take a taxicab,
be there at 10:00 a.m.

01:42:26.224 --> 01:42:28.017
I'll be there at 10:00 a.m.
no matter what.

01:42:28.101 --> 01:42:30.644
In two days. Two days, Brenda.
Two days.

01:42:30.729 --> 01:42:33.605
In two days I'll be there,
no matter what, at 10:00 a.m.

01:42:40.655 --> 01:42:43.490
We're not gonna tell anyone, Brenda.
You have to promise me now.

01:42:43.575 --> 01:42:48.704
Please! Before you go,
please tell me your name. Tell me.

01:42:50.165 --> 01:42:53.792
Frank William Abagnale, Jr.

01:45:06.593 --> 01:45:07.843
Brenda.

01:45:20.857 --> 01:45:22.900
- This guy is a no-show.
- Maybe he was tipped.

01:45:23.193 --> 01:45:24.735
He's not here today, it'll be tomorrow.

01:45:24.819 --> 01:45:26.487
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.

01:45:26.571 --> 01:45:28.363
He doesn't have a passport.

01:45:28.448 --> 01:45:30.491
For the last six months,
he's gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

01:45:30.575 --> 01:45:32.618
I'm betting he can get a passport.

01:45:32.702 --> 01:45:35.037
Our men are waiting for him here
in Miami International.

01:45:35.121 --> 01:45:36.747
He's used it before,
he knows the layout.

01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:40.292
The Miami police offered us
50 uniformed cops in two shifts of 25.

01:45:40.376 --> 01:45:42.753
With our guys,
that's almost 100 men in one airport.

01:45:42.837 --> 01:45:44.296
Don't you think we should
spread it around?

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:45.881
No, this is the exit point.

01:45:45.965 --> 01:45:47.508
How do you know he hasn't rented a car

01:45:47.592 --> 01:45:49.968
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?

01:45:50.053 --> 01:45:53.096
Because I'm not in New York.
I'm not in Atlanta.

01:45:53.389 --> 01:45:55.682
Yes. This is Frank Roberts.

01:45:55.767 --> 01:45:58.268
I'm letting all the universities
in the area know

01:45:58.353 --> 01:46:02.105
that Pan Am will be initiating
a new recruiting program this year.

01:46:02.190 --> 01:46:05.442
I'll be stopping by
your campus tomorrow morning.

01:46:05.944 --> 01:46:08.153
Thank you all very much for coming.

01:46:08.655 --> 01:46:12.074
At the end of the day,
I'll be choosing eight young ladies

01:46:12.158 --> 01:46:13.575
to be a part of

01:46:14.327 --> 01:46:18.163
Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

01:46:18.248 --> 01:46:20.374
These eight young ladies
will accompany me on

01:46:20.458 --> 01:46:23.335
a two-month public relations tour
through Europe

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:27.130
where they will discover firsthand
what it takes

01:46:27.215 --> 01:46:29.258
to be a Pan American stewardess.

01:46:32.345 --> 01:46:36.390
Give me at least two men, no,
one man per every two counters.

01:46:38.643 --> 01:46:39.685
Amdursky?

01:46:41.312 --> 01:46:45.399
Make sure your uniforms are covering
the sidewalks, entrances and exits.

01:46:47.569 --> 01:46:50.404
Let's have periodic sweeps
of the men's lav.

01:46:52.115 --> 01:46:55.117
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

01:46:55.368 --> 01:47:00.122
Well, I think that I'm really friendly
and I can really help out

01:47:00.206 --> 01:47:03.208
and make people feel welcome
on the plane and...

01:47:03.293 --> 01:47:05.502
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour,

01:47:05.587 --> 01:47:07.546
at an altitude of 300 feet.

01:47:07.672 --> 01:47:09.965
All my bags are packed

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.384
I'm ready to go

01:47:14.762 --> 01:47:16.346
Ilene Anderson.

01:47:24.564 --> 01:47:26.023
Miggy Acker.

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:32.571
Debra Jo McMillan.

01:47:39.621 --> 01:47:41.038
Candy Heston.

01:48:40.556 --> 01:48:43.642
- Did you see that blonde out front?
- I should have been a pilot.

01:48:43.726 --> 01:48:44.726
Exactly.

01:48:44.811 --> 01:48:47.688
Mr. Hanratty,
pick up the courtesy telephone.

01:48:47.772 --> 01:48:48.814
Hanratty.

01:48:48.898 --> 01:48:50.190
Your walkie-talkie
wasn't working.

01:48:50.274 --> 01:48:51.942
There's a guy in a Pan Am uniform

01:48:52.026 --> 01:48:54.861
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
in front of Terminal J.

01:48:54.946 --> 01:48:58.156
That's the charter terminal.
Did you get a look at his face?

01:48:58.241 --> 01:49:01.368
He's got his pilot's cap on.
Carl, I think it's him.

01:49:13.548 --> 01:49:15.173
Out of the car, Frank.

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.008
Frank?

01:49:17.218 --> 01:49:19.052
Step out of the car.

01:49:19.303 --> 01:49:21.263
Keep your hands where I can see them.

01:49:21.347 --> 01:49:23.223
Don't shoot me. I'm just a driver.

01:49:23.307 --> 01:49:25.142
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

01:49:25.226 --> 01:49:28.437
- to pick someone up at the airport.
- Who're you picking up?

01:49:28.521 --> 01:49:29.646
Hey!

01:49:54.297 --> 01:49:57.299
South America, Australia,
Singapore, Egypt.

01:49:57.383 --> 01:49:59.509
The kid's gone completely
out of control.

01:49:59.594 --> 01:50:01.928
- Why wasn't I called?
- Nobody was called, sir.

01:50:02.013 --> 01:50:03.805
The banks didn't know
what was happening until last week.

01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:04.931
That's impossible.

01:50:05.016 --> 01:50:07.267
They didn't call because it's not
counterfeiting. It's something else.

01:50:07.351 --> 01:50:09.978
- What is he doing?
- He's making real checks, sir.

01:50:10.062 --> 01:50:11.938
These are so perfect,
the airline didn't know the difference.

01:50:12.023 --> 01:50:13.899
Last check was cashed in Madrid
a week ago.

01:50:13.983 --> 01:50:16.777
My guess is he's still there.
We've to leave now, sir. Today.

01:50:16.861 --> 01:50:19.529
For where? Spain?
You want to go to Spain?

01:50:19.614 --> 01:50:21.907
Eventually, he's gotta go back
to where the checks were printed.

01:50:21.991 --> 01:50:23.366
I think that's why he's moving back
through Europe.

01:50:23.451 --> 01:50:24.868
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

01:50:24.952 --> 01:50:26.661
He's running out of checks.

01:50:26.746 --> 01:50:31.208
It's a long shot, but if we could track him
from Madrid, we could still catch him.

01:50:31.292 --> 01:50:34.294
I'm sorry, Carl. If you couldn't catch him
here, you're not gonna catch him there.

01:50:34.378 --> 01:50:36.213
We're going to let him get away.

01:50:37.381 --> 01:50:39.758
No, Carl, you let him get away.

01:51:21.634 --> 01:51:24.261
A perfect one-sixteenth

01:51:24.637 --> 01:51:26.429
all the way around.

01:51:28.724 --> 01:51:31.017
Color separation is flawless.

01:51:33.771 --> 01:51:35.313
There's no bleeding.

01:51:35.439 --> 01:51:38.149
Nobody does work like this
in the States.

01:51:38.234 --> 01:51:39.693
Nobody but us.

01:51:39.777 --> 01:51:41.486
Where was it printed?

01:51:41.571 --> 01:51:44.364
- It was printed on a monster.
- A monster.

01:51:44.448 --> 01:51:46.825
- A Heidelberg, an Istra.
- Heidelberg.

01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:50.245
A dinosaur, four colors,
you can smell the weight.

01:51:50.496 --> 01:51:52.664
Two tons, without the ink.

01:51:53.207 --> 01:51:55.625
Where do they do printing like this?

01:51:55.710 --> 01:51:57.335
Germany, Great Britain.

01:51:57.420 --> 01:51:58.670
France.

01:52:01.090 --> 01:52:03.508
France. Frank's mother said the name
of a village in France,

01:52:03.593 --> 01:52:04.885
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

01:52:04.969 --> 01:52:06.678
The village where
she met Frank's father.

01:52:06.762 --> 01:52:07.888
I don't remember.

01:52:07.972 --> 01:52:11.808
It started with an "M."
It was "Mont" something. Mr. Fox?

01:52:11.893 --> 01:52:14.352
Yes. Question,
"You met your husband during the war?"

01:52:14.437 --> 01:52:16.438
Answer, "I lived in a very small village
in France,

01:52:16.522 --> 01:52:17.981
"the kind of place
where they never heard of Sara Lee."

01:52:18.065 --> 01:52:21.026
Tell me you wrote down
the name of the village, Mr. Fox.

01:52:22.612 --> 01:52:24.029
Montrichard.

01:53:20.878 --> 01:53:22.045
Carl?

01:53:24.715 --> 01:53:26.383
Merry Christmas!

01:53:26.509 --> 01:53:29.469
How is it that we're always talking
on Christmas?

01:53:29.553 --> 01:53:31.763
Every Christmas, I'm talking to you!

01:53:31.847 --> 01:53:34.432
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

01:53:34.517 --> 01:53:36.643
Are you hungry?
Do you want some beans?

01:53:36.727 --> 01:53:38.645
Carl, they got
the best French beans here.

01:53:38.729 --> 01:53:42.482
There's two dozen
French police officers outside.

01:53:42.566 --> 01:53:43.984
They wanted to bring you in,

01:53:44.068 --> 01:53:46.403
but they needed the help
of an American.

01:53:46.487 --> 01:53:47.988
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you,

01:53:48.072 --> 01:53:50.073
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

01:53:50.199 --> 01:53:52.826
You have a gun? Do you have a gun?
No gun?

01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:53.910
- No.
- No gun.

01:53:55.871 --> 01:53:58.039
And you're telling me what?

01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:01.209
There's two dozen
French police officers

01:54:01.293 --> 01:54:02.794
out there right now on Christmas Eve?

01:54:02.878 --> 01:54:05.088
- That's what you're telling me?
- Yeah.

01:54:05.172 --> 01:54:07.757
All right. There's no windows here.

01:54:08.342 --> 01:54:09.843
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

01:54:09.927 --> 01:54:10.927
No!

01:54:11.012 --> 01:54:15.015
I told them I'd walk out first
and give a signal. Put these on yourself.

01:54:15.099 --> 01:54:17.767
No, I can't do that! You know why?

01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:20.854
Because I think you're full of shit.

01:54:20.938 --> 01:54:23.523
I don't think there's anyone else
out there.

01:54:23.607 --> 01:54:26.443
I think it's just me and you. That's right.

01:54:26.527 --> 01:54:28.319
It's just me and you,
and you know what?

01:54:28.988 --> 01:54:30.947
You're gonna have to catch me yourself.

01:54:31.032 --> 01:54:33.992
- We don't have time for this.
- That's good.

01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:37.328
Tell me what you want me to see.

01:54:37.872 --> 01:54:41.541
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- You're wearing a wedding ring.

01:54:41.625 --> 01:54:44.252
You lied to me about that!
Did you lie about that?

01:54:44.336 --> 01:54:48.173
You asked me if I had a family.
I did. But I don't anymore.

01:54:56.849 --> 01:55:00.769
Yes. No, there is no problem.
We're coming out right now.

01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:04.731
That was good.

01:55:05.274 --> 01:55:07.400
Did you pay some hotel desk clerk
to make that call for you?

01:55:07.485 --> 01:55:08.526
Is that what you did?

01:55:08.611 --> 01:55:11.780
It was Captain Luc.
I've got one minute to bring you out.

01:55:11.864 --> 01:55:14.282
Captain Luc? Oh, Captain Luc! Well,

01:55:14.366 --> 01:55:18.244
that sounds pretty official to me,
but, like I said,

01:55:18.329 --> 01:55:22.290
I think it's just me and you here.
So you'll have to catch me.

01:55:22.374 --> 01:55:24.876
Frank, you have to trust me on this.

01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:28.088
These people have been embarrassed.
They're angry.

01:55:28.172 --> 01:55:30.632
You rob their banks, you steal
their money, you live in their country.

01:55:30.716 --> 01:55:32.967
I told you this was
what was going to happen.

01:55:33.052 --> 01:55:34.761
That there was no other way
for it to end.

01:55:36.055 --> 01:55:37.931
Don't make a mistake.

01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:40.391
That's good, Carl, you know?

01:55:41.018 --> 01:55:43.770
Keep pushing that lie. Keep pushing it.

01:55:43.854 --> 01:55:47.482
- Keep pushing till you make it true.
- They'll kill you.

01:55:47.817 --> 01:55:50.026
You walk out that door,
they're gonna kill you.

01:55:55.282 --> 01:55:57.033
Is that the truth?

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:02.247
Yeah.

01:56:08.003 --> 01:56:09.546
Do you have any children, Carl?

01:56:10.965 --> 01:56:13.383
I have a 4-year-old daughter.

01:56:14.218 --> 01:56:16.553
Do you swear on your daughter?

01:56:18.722 --> 01:56:20.098
You swear?

01:56:25.479 --> 01:56:26.813
You swear?

01:56:58.804 --> 01:57:00.972
That was really good, Carl.

01:57:08.689 --> 01:57:10.023
I have him in custody.

01:57:11.483 --> 01:57:13.610
I got him! It's all right.

01:57:15.613 --> 01:57:17.488
It's all right. I got him.

01:57:21.202 --> 01:57:23.244
I want it on the record.

01:57:23.871 --> 01:57:27.582
Frank Abagnale surrendered
of his own accord. Understood?

01:57:28.751 --> 01:57:31.419
Where are you taking him?
I'm supposed to go.

01:57:33.339 --> 01:57:35.924
Let me in the car!

01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:45.433
Don't worry. I'll have you extradited back
to the United States.

01:58:06.747 --> 01:58:07.830
Carl.

01:58:11.502 --> 01:58:15.255
You have to remember
to let me call my father when we land.

01:58:15.339 --> 01:58:20.093
I want to talk to him before he sees me
on television or something like that.

01:58:30.396 --> 01:58:31.813
Carl, look.

01:58:32.147 --> 01:58:34.148
That's LaGuardia right there.

01:58:34.233 --> 01:58:35.608
Runway 44.

01:58:35.734 --> 01:58:37.902
Frank, your father is dead.

01:58:38.737 --> 01:58:40.113
I'm sorry.

01:58:41.031 --> 01:58:44.826
I didn't want to say anything
until we got closer to home.

01:58:45.661 --> 01:58:46.953
He fell down some steps

01:58:47.037 --> 01:58:50.290
at Grand Central Station
trying to catch a train.

01:58:50.833 --> 01:58:52.875
I didn't want to be the one to tell you.

01:58:53.877 --> 01:58:55.712
You're lying, right?

01:58:57.506 --> 01:58:59.799
You said I could talk to him.

01:58:59.925 --> 01:59:02.719
Who are you to say something like that?

01:59:03.637 --> 01:59:05.888
- You said I could talk to him.
- He fell

01:59:05.973 --> 01:59:08.474
and he broke his neck. I'm sorry.

01:59:09.643 --> 01:59:11.352
I'm really sorry.

01:59:22.406 --> 01:59:23.823
God damn it!

01:59:25.826 --> 01:59:27.702
I'm going to be sick.

01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:29.954
It's all right. It's okay.

01:59:30.039 --> 01:59:33.666
- I'm going to be sick!
- Sure. Let's go to the bathroom.

01:59:40.591 --> 01:59:42.008
God damn it!

02:00:01.737 --> 02:00:02.945
Daddy.

02:00:05.574 --> 02:00:06.824
You'll have to take your seat, sir.

02:00:06.909 --> 02:00:09.494
I've told you twice.
We're landing. All of you.

02:00:09.578 --> 02:00:11.371
Frank! Come on now.

02:00:11.622 --> 02:00:14.499
We're landing in six minutes.
You need to be in your seats...

02:00:14.583 --> 02:00:17.001
- Open the door!
- ...with seat belts fastened.

02:00:17.336 --> 02:00:18.628
Frank!

02:00:20.255 --> 02:00:21.589
You do it.

02:00:51.161 --> 02:00:52.370
Frank!

02:00:58.335 --> 02:01:01.295
All right,
remain seated everyone, please.

02:01:10.431 --> 02:01:12.348
Please remain seated.

02:01:15.269 --> 02:01:16.769
God Almighty.

02:02:06.487 --> 02:02:08.196
What's your name?

02:02:12.201 --> 02:02:13.576
Where's your mommy?

02:02:38.894 --> 02:02:40.645
Sarge, we're good.

02:02:50.739 --> 02:02:51.822
Hold up!

02:02:55.452 --> 02:02:57.828
Put your hands behind your head!

02:02:57.913 --> 02:02:59.080
Carl.

02:02:59.289 --> 02:03:01.415
Get me in the car, please.

02:03:04.127 --> 02:03:05.545
Put him in.

02:03:22.479 --> 02:03:25.815
Taking into account
the gravity of these crimes,

02:03:25.983 --> 02:03:29.068
your history of bold
and elusive behavior

02:03:29.403 --> 02:03:33.322
and your complete lack of respect
for the laws of the United States,

02:03:33.907 --> 02:03:38.327
I have no choice but to ignore
your request to be treated as a minor,

02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:43.499
and sentence you to 12 years
in Atlanta's maximum security prison

02:03:44.126 --> 02:03:47.753
and recommend strongly
that you be kept in isolation

02:03:47.921 --> 02:03:50.464
for the entirety of that sentence.

02:04:32.549 --> 02:04:34.175
Merry Christmas, Frank.

02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:39.388
I got you some comic books.

02:04:46.313 --> 02:04:48.731
How's your daughter?
What was her name?

02:04:49.107 --> 02:04:50.316
Grace.

02:04:52.027 --> 02:04:55.154
I don't know. She lives with her mother
in Chicago, I don't get to see her much.

02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:59.283
What's in the briefcase?

02:05:00.285 --> 02:05:02.578
I'm on my way to the airport.

02:05:02.871 --> 02:05:04.997
It's a paperhanger
working his way through Minnesota.

02:05:07.125 --> 02:05:09.418
Jesus. He's driving us crazy.

02:05:09.711 --> 02:05:11.170
You got any of the checks?

02:05:11.505 --> 02:05:14.131
Yeah, I got a counterfeit he drew

02:05:14.424 --> 02:05:16.676
in Great Lakes Savings and Loan.

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:19.804
He's using a stencil machine
and an Underwood.

02:05:20.263 --> 02:05:21.847
It's a teller at the bank.

02:05:22.265 --> 02:05:23.557
Say again?

02:05:23.642 --> 02:05:25.351
It's definitely a teller, Carl.

02:05:25.435 --> 02:05:28.354
Banks always use hand stamps
for the dates.

02:05:28.438 --> 02:05:31.607
They get used over and over again,
so they always get worn out.

02:05:31.692 --> 02:05:35.236
And the numbers are always cracking.
The sixes and the nines,

02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:37.113
see, they go first.

02:05:39.533 --> 02:05:40.783
Thanks.

02:05:46.873 --> 02:05:49.709
I'd like you to take a look
at something for me.

02:05:53.964 --> 02:05:55.965
Tell me what you think.

02:05:59.469 --> 02:06:01.011
That's a fake.

02:06:01.138 --> 02:06:02.471
How do you know,
you haven't looked at it?

02:06:02.556 --> 02:06:04.682
There's no perforated edge, right?

02:06:04.808 --> 02:06:07.727
I mean, this check was hand-cut,
not fed.

02:06:09.062 --> 02:06:10.271
Yeah.

02:06:10.355 --> 02:06:14.150
Paper is double-bonded,
much too heavy to be a bank check.

02:06:15.318 --> 02:06:19.280
Magnetic ink, it's raised against
my fingers instead of flat.

02:06:21.032 --> 02:06:25.327
And this doesn't smell like MICR,
it's some kind of a drafting ink.

02:06:25.412 --> 02:06:28.205
The kind you get at a stationery store.

02:06:33.503 --> 02:06:34.754
Frank,

02:06:35.505 --> 02:06:40.092
would you be interested in working
with the F.B.I.'s Financial Crimes Unit?

02:06:40.427 --> 02:06:43.846
I already got a job here, you know.
I deliver the mail.

02:06:46.391 --> 02:06:49.810
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

02:06:50.979 --> 02:06:53.439
You'll be placed in the custody
of the F.B.I. where you'd serve out

02:06:53.523 --> 02:06:54.607
the remainder of your sentence

02:06:54.691 --> 02:06:56.233
as an employee
of the Federal Government.

02:06:59.196 --> 02:07:01.030
Under whose custody?

02:07:09.873 --> 02:07:11.081
Hi.

02:07:11.208 --> 02:07:14.877
I'm Frank Abagnale.
I'm supposed to start work here today.

02:07:14.961 --> 02:07:18.088
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.

02:07:18.298 --> 02:07:19.965
Sir, Mr. Abagnale is here.

02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:22.092
I'm gonna call you back.

02:07:52.082 --> 02:07:54.792
- Hello, Carl.
- Welcome to the F.B.I.

02:07:55.418 --> 02:07:57.962
I'll show you where you're working.

02:08:06.930 --> 02:08:09.348
How long do I have to work here?

02:08:09.474 --> 02:08:12.059
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon,

02:08:12.143 --> 02:08:14.103
45 minutes for lunch.

02:08:15.939 --> 02:08:17.690
No. I mean, how long?

02:08:19.359 --> 02:08:20.776
Every day.

02:08:21.278 --> 02:08:23.529
Every day, Frank, till we let you go.

02:09:17.417 --> 02:09:18.751
Hey, Carl.

02:09:21.338 --> 02:09:22.588
How are you doing?

02:09:22.672 --> 02:09:26.508
It's not a good time, Frank.
I'm clearing my desk for the weekend.

02:09:29.512 --> 02:09:32.222
You mind
if I come to work with you tomorrow?

02:09:32.349 --> 02:09:34.183
Tomorrow is Saturday.

02:09:34.267 --> 02:09:36.143
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.

02:09:36.227 --> 02:09:37.561
I'll be back to work on Monday.

02:09:37.687 --> 02:09:41.065
- You're going to see Grace?
- Yeah, that's the plan.

02:09:44.736 --> 02:09:46.779
What should I do till Monday?

02:09:46.863 --> 02:09:50.199
I'm sorry, kid, I can't help you there.
Excuse me.

02:09:56.539 --> 02:09:58.248
This is Hanratty.

02:09:58.959 --> 02:10:00.709
Yeah, put him on.

02:10:08.885 --> 02:10:10.260
Mr. Sawyer.

02:10:10.971 --> 02:10:12.429
How are you?

02:10:12.722 --> 02:10:16.600
I have half a dozen more checks
on that tour operator at the BVI.

02:10:56.933 --> 02:10:58.934
How did you do it, Frank?

02:11:00.770 --> 02:11:03.439
How did you pass the bar in Louisiana?

02:11:03.523 --> 02:11:05.607
What are you doing here?

02:11:06.276 --> 02:11:07.484
Listen.

02:11:08.194 --> 02:11:10.112
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

02:11:10.196 --> 02:11:12.990
You go back to Europe,
you'll die in Perpignan Prison.

02:11:13.074 --> 02:11:14.033
You try to run here in the States,

02:11:14.117 --> 02:11:17.453
we'll send you back to Atlanta
for 50 years.

02:11:17.537 --> 02:11:18.996
I know that.

02:11:20.665 --> 02:11:23.167
I spent four years
trying to arrange your release.

02:11:23.293 --> 02:11:25.085
I had to convince my bosses
at the F.B.I.

02:11:25.170 --> 02:11:28.047
and the Attorney General
of the United States you wouldn't run.

02:11:28.548 --> 02:11:30.299
Why did you do it?

02:11:31.009 --> 02:11:33.719
- You're just a kid.
- I'm not your kid.

02:11:34.137 --> 02:11:36.513
You said you were going to Chicago.

02:11:36.681 --> 02:11:40.476
My daughter can't see me this weekend.
She's going skiing.

02:11:41.019 --> 02:11:43.312
You said she was four years old.
You're lying.

02:11:43.396 --> 02:11:46.190
She was four when I left. Now she's 15.

02:11:46.691 --> 02:11:49.568
My wife has been remarried
for 11 years.

02:11:49.652 --> 02:11:52.071
I see Grace every now and again.

02:11:52.822 --> 02:11:55.324
- I don't understand.
- Sure you do.

02:11:56.159 --> 02:11:58.869
Sometimes it's easier living the lie.

02:12:02.165 --> 02:12:04.500
I'm gonna let you fly tonight, Frank.

02:12:05.335 --> 02:12:09.505
I won't even try to stop you, because
I know you'll be back on Monday.

02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:10.756
Yeah.

02:12:11.257 --> 02:12:13.675
How do you know I'll come back?

02:12:16.054 --> 02:12:17.179
Look.

02:12:18.223 --> 02:12:19.389
Frank.

02:12:19.724 --> 02:12:21.683
Nobody is chasing you.

02:12:42.122 --> 02:12:44.540
Alice, has he still not called?

02:12:44.624 --> 02:12:46.208
No, he hasn't.

02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:59.012
Good morning.

02:12:59.097 --> 02:13:01.140
I've called this meeting to discuss

02:13:01.224 --> 02:13:03.559
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting.

02:13:03.643 --> 02:13:05.853
The unsub is washing
and altering checks,

02:13:05.937 --> 02:13:07.521
then passing them throughout Arizona.

02:13:12.235 --> 02:13:16.363
This unsub is a big dog,
passing checks as large as five figures.

02:13:19.784 --> 02:13:21.410
Sorry I'm late.

02:13:22.704 --> 02:13:23.912
Sorry.

02:13:28.126 --> 02:13:31.003
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

02:13:31.087 --> 02:13:33.797
Why don't we step out to the bullpen?

02:13:38.219 --> 02:13:40.762
There's impressions on every line.

02:13:42.432 --> 02:13:45.434
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:50.898
Mind if I take a look?

02:13:53.985 --> 02:13:56.403
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

02:13:59.157 --> 02:14:01.241
Cost the bank $16,000.

02:14:02.911 --> 02:14:04.953
- It's a real check.
- Yeah.

02:14:05.622 --> 02:14:09.041
It's been washed.
The only thing original is the signature.

02:14:09.125 --> 02:14:10.834
But it's perfect.

02:14:11.252 --> 02:14:14.171
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.

02:14:14.339 --> 02:14:15.464
No.

02:14:15.590 --> 02:14:17.132
Something new.

02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:22.304
A nail polish remover where the acetone
removes the ink that's not been printed?

02:14:25.433 --> 02:14:27.226
How did you do it, Frank?

02:14:28.645 --> 02:14:31.813
How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?

02:14:36.986 --> 02:14:38.612
I didn't cheat.

02:14:40.156 --> 02:14:42.866
I studied for two weeks and I passed.

02:14:44.994 --> 02:14:46.787
Is that the truth?

02:14:47.664 --> 02:14:48.705
Is that the truth?

02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:51.959
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

02:14:52.043 --> 02:14:55.170
He washes off their names
and puts on his own.

02:14:56.631 --> 02:14:58.757
You're saying he's a local?

02:14:58.841 --> 02:15:02.594
If it were me, I'd call the bank first.
Check out the balance...

02:15:02.679 --> 02:15:04.972
Make sure there's enough money
in there to make it worth your while.

02:15:05.056 --> 02:15:06.181
Exactly.

02:15:06.516 --> 02:15:09.518
You know, Carl, I think
this guy is pretty smart.

02:15:10.019 --> 02:15:12.396
Guess all we have to do now
is catch him.
