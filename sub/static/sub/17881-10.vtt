WEBVTT

00:04.993 --> 00:06.022
Sometimes a project comes along

00:06.023 --> 00:08.396
that kicks the stress
level a a couple notches.

00:08.397 --> 00:10.431
That's when I need to
stay especially calm,

00:10.432 --> 00:12.900
so my people will stay calm.

00:12.901 --> 00:16.076
Hey, cats and kittens, what is going on

00:16.077 --> 00:20.394
- with the multi-language translator device? -
Oh, my God. Ted's overcompensating for his stress.

00:20.395 --> 00:24.025
- The project must be in huge trouble.
- Our lives as we know them are over!

00:24.026 --> 00:27.237
Guys, it's all right, okay.
I just want to make sure

00:27.238 --> 00:29.336
we're on track with the translator.

00:29.337 --> 00:31.336
The Germans are gonna
be here this afternoon.

00:31.337 --> 00:34.166
- They might want to see a demonstration.
- Oh. Well, we can do that.

00:34.167 --> 00:37.099
- What'd you come in here all calm for?
- A...and listen, the Germans are worried about working with us, because, ironically,

00:37.100 --> 00:39.064
they think that Veridian
is ruthlessly efficient

00:39.065 --> 00:41.230
and bent on world domination.

00:41.231 --> 00:43.630
Wow. That's like when
those Irish auditors thought

00:43.631 --> 00:45.730
our accounting department drank too much

00:45.731 --> 00:48.229
- and wrote overly depressing poetry.
- Well, maybe you could put away

00:48.230 --> 00:50.162
some of your especially evil creations.

00:50.163 --> 00:53.162
- Uh, you know, in case they want to see the lab.
- Evil?

00:53.163 --> 00:55.995
We don't create evil things.

00:55.996 --> 00:58.062
Some might see this long-range
people-skinning laser

00:58.063 --> 01:00.229
- as evil-ish. -
That was only designed

01:00.230 --> 01:02.630
so you could peel an
orange in your kitchen

01:02.631 --> 01:05.430
- while sitting comfortably in your living room.
- Well, now it's used to peel enemy soldiers overseas,

01:05.431 --> 01:08.498
- while you sit comfortably at the Pentagon.
- Well, what about this translator device?

01:08.499 --> 01:10.898
That's going to make it easier
for people to talk to each other,

01:10.899 --> 01:13.979
and with the exception of almost
everything my wife ever says to me,

01:13.980 --> 01:15.768
communication is always good.

01:15.301 --> 01:18.801
Well, actually, the military is also
gonna use it to interrogate prisoners.

01:18.802 --> 01:22.470
Listen, just to be safe, why don't we
clear everything away, uh, except the ficus?

01:22.472 --> 01:23.603
You mean the man-eating ficus?

01:23.605 --> 01:28.272
All right. I'll just try to
keep the Germans upstairs.

01:28.273 --> 01:30.808
Is everything we do down here evil?

01:30.809 --> 01:34.013
Well, that's crazy. We
make a lot of nice stuff,

01:34.014 --> 01:35.513
like, uh...

01:35.514 --> 01:36.978
Kills...

01:36.979 --> 01:39.579
Slowly kills... quickly kills...

01:39.580 --> 01:41.446
Helps shed unwanted pounds!

01:41.447 --> 01:43.079
But also kills.

01:43.080 --> 01:47.781
Oh, my God. Maybe we're evil scientists.

01:51.519 --> 01:53.620
I'm sorry.

01:53.621 --> 01:56.523
I laugh like that when faced
with an unpleasant truth.

01:56.524 --> 02:00.526
That's why I got thrown
out of that Al Gore movie.

02:07.901 --> 02:10.163
Hey, excuse me. This isn't a library.

02:10.164 --> 02:13.195
You can't just leave your
trash wherever you want.

02:13.196 --> 02:14.660
Jeez.

02:14.661 --> 02:17.127
Hey, Brett, you see that
awesome Youtube video

02:17.128 --> 02:20.328
of that goat that sounds like a man?

02:20.329 --> 02:23.630
- He keeps yelling... "mark! Mark!"
- I love that goat. He's all... "mark! Mark!"

02:23.631 --> 02:26.165
- Do you mind?
- "Mark!"

02:26.166 --> 02:27.566
- "Mark!"
- "Mark!"

02:27.567 --> 02:29.400
- "Mark!"
- "Mark!"

02:29.401 --> 02:32.235
- That's the last time forward anything to you guys.
- "Mark!"

02:32.236 --> 02:34.237
Worried about the deal with the Germans,

02:34.238 --> 02:36.572
Veronica was also under a lot of stress.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.573
We believe the
multi-language translator

02:38.574 --> 02:41.142
will create a furor in Germany,

02:41.143 --> 02:43.777
a furor that will sweep across Europe,

02:43.778 --> 02:46.178
crushing... no.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:07.394 --> 03:09.428
What's going on?

03:09.429 --> 03:11.262
Do you live here?

03:11.263 --> 03:14.130
Do all the cubicle workers have
little hobbit holes like this?

03:14.131 --> 03:18.266
No, some of us nest in trees,
others have underground warrens.

03:18.267 --> 03:20.534
Actually, I just found this empty room,

03:20.535 --> 03:22.169
so I decorated a little,

03:22.170 --> 03:25.183
and come here occasionally to get a break
from that corporate mosh pit out there.

03:25.184 --> 03:28.614
Was that thumping noise the sound of
you banging your head against the wall,

03:28.615 --> 03:31.287
****

03:31.809 --> 03:34.110
You know, why don't you lay off?

03:34.111 --> 03:36.145
If you want. I'm sorry. It's just,

03:36.146 --> 03:38.080
I'm a little sensitive
about the hobbit jokes,

03:38.081 --> 03:41.048
because I think of myself
as having big, floppy feet.

03:41.049 --> 03:42.916
I know. It's crazy, right?

03:45.085 --> 03:47.653
Fine. Don't reassure me
about my giant feet....

03:47.654 --> 03:50.221
which I might be too sensitive about.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.091
Again, thank you. Anyway,
that thumping sound

03:55.092 --> 03:57.460
was this game I came up
with to blow off steam.

03:57.461 --> 04:01.396
You take a bagel, you stand on this
coffee stain, and you try to bounce it off

04:01.397 --> 04:03.864
that wall and into that air vent.

04:03.865 --> 04:05.732
It's pretty tricky.

04:05.733 --> 04:07.767
Mm... not for me,

04:07.768 --> 04:10.369
because I'm good at everything I do.

04:10.370 --> 04:11.903
I'm not bragging,

04:11.904 --> 04:13.077
because bragging is the
one thing I'm not good at.

04:13.078 --> 04:16.254
Although, if I wanted to be,
I'd be excellent at that, too,

04:16.255 --> 04:17.596
as I've just proved.

04:17.598 --> 04:21.576
Really? You think you'd be
better than me at Linda bagel?

04:21.577 --> 04:23.844
Because, you know... I'm Linda.

04:23.845 --> 04:26.146
And I'm Veronica. So bagel me.

04:28.081 --> 04:30.482
Veronica is late for our big meeting

04:30.483 --> 04:32.484
with the Germans,

04:32.485 --> 04:34.486
who, of course, are right on time.

04:34.487 --> 04:36.521
What? It's a positive stereotype.

04:36.522 --> 04:39.023
Anyway, now I am stuck
having to charm them

04:39.024 --> 04:41.959
all by myself.

04:44.729 --> 04:46.629
which suddenly, I am fine with.

04:46.630 --> 04:48.397
Pots-damn!

04:48.398 --> 04:50.999
Hello, I'm Ted Crisp.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.468
Guten tag, I'm Hans
Muller. This is Carl Hoffman

04:53.469 --> 04:56.003
und our CEO Greta Schulz.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.372
Hello, I am being happy to meet you.

04:58.373 --> 05:00.941
You and I... do it, I hope.

05:00.942 --> 05:03.142
The coming together?

05:03.143 --> 05:06.011
Uh, o... okay. I hope so, too.

05:06.012 --> 05:08.447
Fraulein Schulz is
not fluent in English.

05:08.448 --> 05:11.383
She means she hopes this
deal between our two companies

05:11.384 --> 05:13.584
will come together.

05:13.585 --> 05:15.586
Thanks for the clarification,

05:15.587 --> 05:17.088
herr buzzkill.

05:18.623 --> 05:21.558
Nothin' but vent! Do I look like a bus?

05:21.559 --> 05:24.026
'Cause I just took you to school.

05:24.027 --> 05:27.396
- Suck my big hobbit feet!
- Keep your flippers in your clown shoes, Linda.

05:27.397 --> 05:28.896
We're going again.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.544
The multiple language translator device

05:45.545 --> 05:48.112
will instantaneously
translate any language...

05:48.113 --> 05:50.313
- into any other.
- Just flick this switch

05:50.314 --> 05:54.483
- and turn this dial to the desired language.
- Sorry I'm late. There was an emergency

05:54.484 --> 05:57.652
with the dough-based projectile
ventilation targeting system.

05:57.653 --> 06:00.354
P please... continue.

06:00.355 --> 06:02.288
Phil, who speaks fluent German,
will now speak into the device,

06:02.289 --> 06:04.256
which will translate
what he says into English.

06:07.392 --> 06:09.829
Hello. I am your friend.

06:09.830 --> 06:13.435
Do not be afraid. It's me! Phil!

06:15.839 --> 06:18.674
- I thought you guys were working on the voice.
- We were, and we made it more awesome.

06:18.675 --> 06:20.510
Who wouldn't want to sound

06:20.511 --> 06:22.378
like a 90-foot robot, you know?

06:24.448 --> 06:27.416
Our ships are hovering

06:27.417 --> 06:30.251
above all your cities.

06:30.252 --> 06:32.219
Oh, God. We have unhappy Germans.

06:32.220 --> 06:34.154
Nothing good has ever come from that.

06:34.155 --> 06:36.723
Um, okay, we will have this voice fixed

06:36.724 --> 06:40.126
in a couple days. I...in the meantime,

06:40.127 --> 06:42.828
- why don't you relax?
- Maybe do some sightseeing?

06:42.829 --> 06:44.796
Yes, on us! Throw on
some leather shorts,

06:44.797 --> 06:46.798
dark shoes, socks up to the knees,

06:46.799 --> 06:50.034
and stomp around our fine city.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.569
Perhaps Ted can stomp me.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.306
Ah... stomp with me.

06:56.307 --> 06:59.041
I not wish to die
from Ted's under-boot.

06:59.042 --> 07:01.410
Good, 'cause I just
got new under-boots.

07:01.411 --> 07:03.311
I'd hate to have to scrape you off them.

07:03.312 --> 07:05.346
You know what? Don't translate that.

07:05.347 --> 07:09.783
Just... just tell her I'd
be happy to take her around.

07:13.254 --> 07:16.189
I saw what was going on in there

07:16.190 --> 07:18.291
between you and fraulein cheekbones.

07:18.292 --> 07:20.293
When you show her around town,

07:20.294 --> 07:23.862
- keep your hansels off her gretels.
- I was just being friendly.

07:23.863 --> 07:25.831
I'm serious, Ted. This
deal is too important,

07:25.832 --> 07:28.833
and sex can screw things
up. Why do you think

07:28.834 --> 07:31.068
the three stooges went
through so many curlys?

07:34.272 --> 07:35.805
Wow. Look at her.

07:35.806 --> 07:37.874
I can have a personal relationship

07:37.875 --> 07:39.808
and not screw up a business deal.

07:39.809 --> 07:41.777
I'm nothing like the three stooges.

07:41.778 --> 07:44.813
I have never spent the
night in a mummy museum

07:44.814 --> 07:47.482
or... or smuggled a
chicken into the opera.

07:47.483 --> 07:49.883
Hello, toad.

07:49.884 --> 07:50.851
Ted.

07:50.852 --> 07:52.319
Eat me?

07:52.320 --> 07:57.023
Let's go to dinner. I'm gonna
teach you the word "with".

08:00.428 --> 08:03.095
Phil and Lem couldn't stand the
thought of being evil scientists.

08:03.096 --> 08:06.864
Maybe if we came up with
something that's pure good...

08:06.865 --> 08:08.933
something that the company
couldn't possibly use for evil.

08:08.934 --> 08:10.567
Or... what if we invent something

08:10.568 --> 08:13.103
that's already pure evil?

08:13.104 --> 08:15.872
Then maybe the company will
turn it into something goo

08:15.873 --> 08:18.541
like a horrible device that
drops heavy things on your feet

08:18.542 --> 08:20.309
and tells you the end of movies
you really, really wanted to see.

08:20.310 --> 08:23.845
I thought you saw "The Sixth Sense,"
and I told you I was setting down

08:23.846 --> 08:26.947
-  my end of the sofa.
- Well, I hadn't, and my toe will never be the same.

08:26.948 --> 08:30.517
- How are glasses and mustache doing with the translator voice?
- First of all,

08:30.518 --> 08:32.885
glasses and mustache
are the same person.

08:32.886 --> 08:35.587
- And, uh, Lem and Phil need a little bit more time.
- The Germans aren't going to like this.

08:35.589 --> 08:37.556
Actually, they're in
no hurry to leave town.

08:37.557 --> 08:39.157
Oh, my God.

08:39.158 --> 08:41.326
You're jackhammering Gretel
like she's the Berlin wall.

08:41.327 --> 08:43.260
It was a little more romantic than that.

08:43.261 --> 08:45.162
Although... there was a
lot of cheering in German,

08:45.163 --> 08:47.064
followed by heartfelt congratulations.

08:47.065 --> 08:50.300
Ted, if something goes wrong,
you could blow this whole deal.

08:50.301 --> 08:53.736
But you think nothing will go
wrong, just because it's you.

08:53.737 --> 08:55.637
I do not think that, although
nothing will go wrong.

08:55.638 --> 08:58.540
It's me. That's hubris, Ted.

08:58.541 --> 09:00.541
You're cocky. You think you can't lose.

09:00.542 --> 09:03.644
It's very self-destructive. You
should take a hard look at...

09:03.645 --> 09:06.279
Linda, rematch in 30 minutes, and
this time, there's no way I lose.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.182
Okay, but I don't think
you used my proper title.

09:09.183 --> 09:12.151
Oh, queen Linda the dainty-footed.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.619
Anyway.

09:15.021 --> 09:18.356
You're gonna end up
making a fool of yourself.

09:18.357 --> 09:20.424
So why is Veronica talking to you

09:20.425 --> 09:23.360
- like a waitress at medieval times?
- Wasn't it great? I made up this bagel toss game,

09:23.361 --> 09:25.662
and when she loses,
I make her say stuff.

09:25.663 --> 09:27.530
And she always loses.

09:27.531 --> 09:30.099
Chick throws a bagel like
the horse is still attached.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.034
that works better for horseshoes,

09:32.035 --> 09:35.036
but you get the point. Look,
Veronica's got the better job,

09:35.037 --> 09:37.471
the better car, the better shoe size.

09:37.472 --> 09:39.873
This is the only thing I'll ever do

09:39.874 --> 09:43.009
that I'm better at than she is.

09:43.010 --> 09:47.012
- And I'm telling myself it's the most important thing.
- Well, I can see by the spittle flying out of your mouth

09:47.013 --> 09:49.982
that you're in a good place,
but, uh, you should know,

09:49.983 --> 09:52.917
- Veronica will strike back.
- I don't care. It's worth it, as long as I keep winning...

09:52.918 --> 09:55.954
- which I will, because I am Linda of Linda bagel.
- You know what that is? That's hubris. You're cocky.

09:55.955 --> 09:58.892
You think you can't lose.
It's very self-destructive.

09:58.893 --> 10:00.660
you should take a hard
look at... ooh! It's Greta.

10:00.661 --> 10:04.063
We've got a date tonight.
It is gonna be awesome.

10:04.064 --> 10:06.465
Here's a little extra work

10:06.466 --> 10:08.266
that requires your
royal touch, queen Linda.

10:08.267 --> 10:11.135
Heavy is the head that
wears the $10 haircut.

10:11.136 --> 10:12.903
No problem.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.739
It's as easy as throwing
a bagel through a vent.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.376
For some people, that's
practically impossible.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.115
in spite of not being
able to speak very well,

10:27.116 --> 10:30.117
Greta and I were having
no trouble communicating.

10:33.820 --> 10:36.121
Oh! Hmm?

10:36.122 --> 10:40.524
It is here. Herr Muller bring for me.

10:40.525 --> 10:42.325
Surprise.

10:42.326 --> 10:46.328
I tell Flem and the little bird man,

10:46.329 --> 10:48.229
"mach schnell.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.731
I must speak with mein Ted."

10:50.732 --> 10:53.967
Really? They fixed
it. That is fantastic.

10:55.537 --> 10:57.574
I really like you, Ted.

10:57.575 --> 10:59.611
You're a very special man.

10:59.612 --> 11:01.313
Is that Phil's voice?

11:01.314 --> 11:02.782
What's wrong?

11:02.783 --> 11:04.283
Die stimme

11:04.284 --> 11:07.052
Von diesen dingen ist mein freund Phil.

11:07.053 --> 11:09.388
I like this voice.
It's warm and friendly

11:09.389 --> 11:11.923
and almost gender-neutral.

11:11.924 --> 11:14.659
The device works. Our business
deal will be a success.

11:14.660 --> 11:16.059
Kiss me, Ted.

11:16.060 --> 11:18.961
Kiss me hard on the lips.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.365
What?

11:24.366 --> 11:26.433
I thought you'd be happy we can finally

11:26.434 --> 11:29.569
get to know each other
on an emotional level.

11:29.570 --> 11:32.272
- Our relationship wasn't just about sex, was it?
- No.

11:32.273 --> 11:33.739
Nein.

11:33.740 --> 11:36.342
Then let's go into the bedroom,

11:36.343 --> 11:38.510
and we can make love and talk

11:38.511 --> 11:40.679
and make love and talk all night.

11:42.315 --> 11:43.582
Yay.

11:43.583 --> 11:44.783
Yay.

11:54.892 --> 11:56.892
Phil, why on earth would you use

11:56.893 --> 12:00.295
- your voice for the translator device?
- It was the fastest way to fix it,

12:00.296 --> 12:02.297
since we already had
my voice in the computer

12:02.298 --> 12:05.399
- from that failed talking frying pan project.
- Stupid thing wouldn't stop screamin

12:05.400 --> 12:08.334
- when you put it on the burner.
- Plus, it was very critical...

12:08.335 --> 12:10.134
"you really need that much butter?"

12:10.135 --> 12:12.202
Screw you, frying pan.

12:12.203 --> 12:14.571
Okay, fellas... excuse us.

12:14.572 --> 12:17.173
So here's the deal.
Greta and I are dating.

12:18.542 --> 12:21.476
But... it's hard for me
to fulfill my manly duties

12:21.477 --> 12:25.213
- when Phil keeps telling me how much I'm pleasuring him.
- Oh, my God.

12:25.214 --> 12:27.048
Yes. You said that a lot last night.

12:27.049 --> 12:29.483
Guys, I need your help.
I really like Greta,

12:29.484 --> 12:32.485
and I don't want this thing between
us to go south, plus if it does,

12:32.486 --> 12:35.288
I... I could foul up this whole
deal, and Veronica's gonna kill me.

12:35.289 --> 12:37.165
Recording and loading a
new voice could take days.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.476
Well, we still have those Nixon tapes.

12:38.477 --> 12:39.973
I guess we could pull from those.

12:39.974 --> 12:42.432
I'm beginning to think you
guys really are evil scientists.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.996
Oh, hi, Ted. How are
things going with Greta?

12:45.997 --> 12:48.898
- You screw that up yet?
- No, not at all. We really like each other.

12:48.899 --> 12:51.834
Plus, she is very happy with
the new voice on the translator.

12:51.835 --> 12:55.004
The guys just need a
little time to tweak it.

12:55.005 --> 12:58.573
- It's close, it's close. Ohh, it's so close.
- Oh, man. I have to go.

13:00.109 --> 13:03.277
I need you to design me a perfect bagel.

13:03.278 --> 13:04.745
Perfect but somehow evil?

13:04.746 --> 13:07.214
Like halfway down your
throat, it triples in size

13:07.215 --> 13:09.716
or tells you the end to "Rocky IV"?

13:09.717 --> 13:13.819
- No, just a dozen perfect, aerodynamically balanced bagels.
- A perfect bagel...

13:13.820 --> 13:17.222
- there's no way that could be used for anything bad.
- I'm using them to cheat.

13:17.223 --> 13:19.690
Linda sucked me into this stupid game,

13:19.691 --> 13:22.393
and your super-bagels
will help me destroy her.

13:22.394 --> 13:25.128
- And... boom. We're back in the evil business.
- Oh, and throw in a pint of cream cheese.

13:25.129 --> 13:27.263
I don't care how evil you are...

13:27.264 --> 13:30.132
you don't show up with
bagels and no schmear.

13:32.001 --> 13:33.768
Linda.

13:33.769 --> 13:36.737
So if a guy asked you
not to talk during sex,

13:36.738 --> 13:41.007
- would you be offended?
- No woman likes to be told to shut up during sex.

13:41.008 --> 13:43.877
Wait. Did Paul from accounting
tell you to ask me that?

13:43.878 --> 13:46.079
Because all we did was
make out in his car,

13:46.080 --> 13:49.449
- and all I said was, "get off my hair."
- Paul from accounting? Really?

13:49.450 --> 13:50.850
No. Gotcha.

13:50.851 --> 13:53.720
Would you leave? I have
a lot of work to do.

13:53.721 --> 13:55.989
Yeah, what is all this?

13:55.990 --> 13:58.691
- Veronica's retaliating.
- Why don't you just let her win?

13:58.692 --> 14:01.692
Wh... what are you afraid of?
If you...if you throw a game,

14:01.693 --> 14:03.305
it's gonna keep you out of
the time-wasters' hall of fame?

14:03.306 --> 14:04.694
No. My position there is secure

14:04.695 --> 14:07.096
from getting my art history degree.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.498
I just can't make myself lose.

14:09.499 --> 14:11.654
I've tried, but it feels
so good to beat her.

14:11.655 --> 14:13.855
Well, then figure out a way
to end the game without losing.

14:13.860 --> 14:16.337
Like, when Rose gets
frustrated with checkers,

14:16.338 --> 14:18.305
she just flips the board over.

14:18.306 --> 14:18.938
I once tried the same thing
in Vegas with a craps' table.

14:18.939 --> 14:21.810
Got it up just high enough to
tear every muscle in my back.

14:22.672 --> 14:24.411
Interesting. Like when
Van Gogh got so frustrated

14:24.412 --> 14:27.613
with his paintings, he
ripped up his canvases.

14:27.614 --> 14:31.683
That little factoid cost my
parents $60,000 in tui

14:32.305 --> 14:38.695
