00:00.109 --> 00:02.085
<i>Previously on "The Mist"...</i>

00:02.133 --> 00:04.906
I cannot do what you ask of me.

00:04.938 --> 00:05.871
I can.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.272
You must repent.

00:08.909 --> 00:12.878
No! No! Please! No.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.213
Let me help you die.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.316
I will put a bullet

00:17.384 --> 00:19.885
in whatever body part
you touch her with.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.720
- Understood?
- Yeah.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.255
What's going on?

00:23.324 --> 00:24.956
I can't find a solution without...

00:26.627 --> 00:27.726
experiments.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.328
Get Kevin!

00:33.434 --> 00:34.800
Let's go!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.792
And where the hell are we going?

00:36.853 --> 00:38.503
The only place the doors will stay shut.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.105
- Where?
- The psych ward.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.124
- Open up!
- Open the door!

00:52.358 --> 00:53.560
Anybody in there?!

00:53.608 --> 00:55.262
- Come on!
- Hey, come on! Let us in!

00:55.317 --> 00:57.410
- Help! Help!
- Hurry!

00:57.479 --> 00:59.833
- Who is it?
- Let us in, please.

00:59.872 --> 01:02.030
How do I know that you're not
part of that thing out there?

01:02.054 --> 01:05.016
Look, II'm Anna Lambert's daughter.

01:05.086 --> 01:06.219
She was here.

01:06.287 --> 01:09.388
Please! Just let us in.

01:09.457 --> 01:10.457
Come on.

01:17.932 --> 01:20.230
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

01:20.277 --> 01:21.743
You can't be too careful.

01:21.812 --> 01:23.678
Thank you.

01:23.747 --> 01:25.418
Yeah, come on in.

01:36.107 --> 01:39.866
- Sit him down... Whoa! Whoa!
- What's with him?

01:39.936 --> 01:41.585
Crazy doctor drugged him.

01:41.647 --> 01:43.647
Yeah, welcome to my world.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.247
We can't stay here. We gotta go.

01:45.316 --> 01:46.563
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:46.619 --> 01:48.403
Whoa, whoa, no, no,
you don't look like someone

01:48.427 --> 01:50.928
who... who should be traveling
right now.

01:51.208 --> 01:53.344
He's right. We need rest.

01:54.119 --> 01:57.189
Yeah, well, there's not a lot
of people left around here.

01:57.489 --> 01:59.856
TThere's rooms down the hallway.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.930
Beds are already made.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.994
Help yourself.

02:04.062 --> 02:06.629
Hey, um, and II'm so sorry,

02:07.039 --> 02:08.461
about your mom.

02:08.821 --> 02:10.600
She wasn't like the rest of them.

02:11.102 --> 02:13.103
Nothing bad in her.

02:13.171 --> 02:14.304
Thanks.

02:36.467 --> 02:37.732
Wait.

02:38.063 --> 02:39.996
Thought you wanted to be alone.

02:40.338 --> 02:41.370
What do you mean?

02:42.134 --> 02:43.600
You took off.

02:44.050 --> 02:46.384
Well, if you let me, I can...
I can explain.

03:13.340 --> 03:15.003
No touching.

03:15.098 --> 03:17.309
That's a shame.
I really wanted to shoot him.

03:18.129 --> 03:20.623
Save your bullets. If Jay's right,

03:20.671 --> 03:22.404
if they're really going crazy out there,

03:22.473 --> 03:25.540
throwing people out of the mall,
then we'll need the bullets.

03:25.609 --> 03:27.509
And if they're not,

03:27.578 --> 03:28.988
he's a bigger psychopath
than we thought,

03:29.012 --> 03:31.480
so I guess we'll have to find out.

03:31.548 --> 03:33.281
Do they work?

03:33.350 --> 03:35.851
The fancy ones didn't,
but the simple battery ones do.

03:35.919 --> 03:38.253
Well, here's to simple things.

03:46.663 --> 03:48.129
Gus?

03:48.198 --> 03:49.965
Gus, are you in there?

03:50.033 --> 03:51.132
Hold on a sec.

03:54.638 --> 03:55.638
Come in.

03:59.186 --> 04:01.119
We have a bit of a situation downstairs.

04:01.345 --> 04:02.944
- Hey!
- Get the fuck off me, man.

04:03.013 --> 04:05.280
Hey!

04:07.217 --> 04:09.161
What the hell is going on?

04:09.216 --> 04:12.521
He tried to skip the rations
and just eat whatever he wanted.

04:12.589 --> 04:14.489
You out of your mind?

04:14.558 --> 04:16.224
We've got two days worth
of rations left.

04:16.293 --> 04:17.659
Wasn't me. It was Kyle.

04:18.639 --> 04:20.028
I'm starving, man.

04:20.096 --> 04:21.329
We all are.

04:21.398 --> 04:22.623
All we got is biscuits and tea left.

04:22.647 --> 04:24.272
I'm not the fucking Queen of England.

04:24.319 --> 04:25.975
And you saw the pamphlets.
The military's coming.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.728
But we don't know when,
and we don't know

04:27.790 --> 04:30.171
how large an area
they spread the fliers over.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.940
What do you want?

04:32.009 --> 04:34.350
Just seeing if I could borrow
some of your board games.

04:34.412 --> 04:37.006
- You don't have any business here.
- Yeah.

04:37.619 --> 04:39.019
Fine.

04:56.990 --> 04:58.882
I love that song.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.640
Me, too. I find it comforting.

05:02.940 --> 05:05.532
My father would beat my mother.

05:06.410 --> 05:08.610
My sister would bring my brother
and me into her room,

05:08.664 --> 05:12.599
and she'd play it,
turn it up as loud as she could.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.050
I hate that song.

05:16.954 --> 05:18.219
My wife loved it.

05:20.411 --> 05:22.161
Okay.

05:22.669 --> 05:25.481
- All done for now.
- Thank you, Doctor.

05:35.579 --> 05:38.239
You must of get a lot of that
here, Father?

05:41.678 --> 05:43.144
Excuse me?

05:43.213 --> 05:45.710
I said you must get a lot of that here,

05:46.149 --> 05:47.875
men beating women,

05:48.285 --> 05:50.956
absolving them of their sins.

05:51.901 --> 05:55.932
Sins are unfortunately
a part of being human.

05:56.487 --> 06:00.401
It's horrible,
watching a man beat a woman.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.255
Nothing worse.

06:05.268 --> 06:07.602
I've been a cop for over 15 years.

06:09.124 --> 06:10.904
It's about the only thing I'm good at,

06:11.642 --> 06:13.742
like knowing when people
are hiding things.

06:22.619 --> 06:24.642
You haven't touched your food.

06:25.022 --> 06:26.782
So?

06:27.057 --> 06:29.626
Guilt's a real appetite killer.

06:30.007 --> 06:31.239
So is fear.

06:38.708 --> 06:41.409
There is something worse
than men beating women.

06:42.486 --> 06:43.872
It's when a man is such a coward

06:43.940 --> 06:45.940
that he has someone else do it for him.

06:47.244 --> 06:50.845
Chief Heisel, in your experience,

06:50.914 --> 06:54.282
do priests often beat older ladies?

06:54.989 --> 06:56.802
No...

06:57.364 --> 06:59.516
but they know how to manipulate
altar boys.

07:01.342 --> 07:02.608
Mr. Heisel...

07:02.778 --> 07:04.444
Do you have something to confess?

07:16.206 --> 07:17.206
No!

07:18.131 --> 07:20.365
Stop it! Help him!

07:21.960 --> 07:23.611
Nobody's gonna help you.

07:59.883 --> 08:02.124
Look, your name isn't Bryan Hunt.

08:02.175 --> 08:04.376
It's Jonah Dixon.

08:04.554 --> 08:07.891
You beat up a solider called
Bryan Hunt up at Arrowhead.

08:07.930 --> 08:09.057
You stole his clothes.

08:10.494 --> 08:12.242
I met Bryan,

08:13.190 --> 08:15.457
and that's why I took off.

08:16.148 --> 08:20.135
Now, either you really do have
memory loss, or you're a psycho.

08:20.203 --> 08:21.203
Which is it?

08:21.238 --> 08:24.345
I... I didn't know.

08:24.751 --> 08:25.607
I swear.

08:25.675 --> 08:26.741
Didn't know what?

08:26.810 --> 08:28.076
My name.

08:28.188 --> 08:31.141
I met him after you left.

08:31.481 --> 08:33.235
He tried to kill me.

08:37.921 --> 08:39.568
I'm Jonah?

08:40.068 --> 08:42.056
You're Jonah.

08:46.897 --> 08:48.349
Where'd you go?

08:49.927 --> 08:51.399
I...

08:52.606 --> 08:54.662
I went to my mother's house,

08:54.826 --> 08:56.171
wanted to run away.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.774
And my mom was there.

09:02.006 --> 09:03.685
Or you know.

09:04.181 --> 09:06.881
And she wanted to help me die,

09:07.693 --> 09:09.282
and I didn't want to,

09:09.407 --> 09:11.219
and I was so surprised that I didn't,

09:11.288 --> 09:15.407
'cause I have nothing to live for.

09:16.927 --> 09:18.587
Except...

09:20.697 --> 09:23.264
Except maybe... maybe I do.

09:26.599 --> 09:29.600
I believe you, and...

09:31.717 --> 09:34.518
I want to be someone you can believe in.

09:36.397 --> 09:38.697
But to be that, I need your help.

09:40.483 --> 09:42.155
Okay.

09:42.485 --> 09:44.601
I'm gonna do rapid detox.

09:46.679 --> 09:49.791
I take opiate blockers,

09:49.860 --> 09:53.452
and they'll work in my body
for five, six hours,

09:53.517 --> 09:55.750
and when I'm done, I'll be clean.

09:55.999 --> 10:00.679
And what I need you to do is tie me up

10:01.071 --> 10:02.303
and not let me out.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.668
Why?

10:03.754 --> 10:08.285
'Cause it's usually done under
general anesthesia, for good reason.

10:13.216 --> 10:14.282
Jonah...

10:18.121 --> 10:19.854
please.

10:28.665 --> 10:29.998
Where are we going?

10:33.763 --> 10:35.885
A room far away.

10:36.658 --> 10:38.455
There'll be lots of screaming.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.838
<i>Help must be on the way.</i>

11:00.863 --> 11:03.328
<i>Yeah, but we only have
two days of food left.</i>

11:03.398 --> 11:04.967
Don't.

11:05.513 --> 11:07.957
- You can't trust him.
- I trust myself.

11:08.019 --> 11:09.388
You're 16. You don't know who...

11:09.443 --> 11:10.925
What are your qualifications, then?

11:10.995 --> 11:12.010
What do you mean?

11:12.079 --> 11:13.445
For knowing whom I should trust.

11:13.514 --> 11:15.747
I'm your mom.

11:15.816 --> 11:17.149
That's my qualification,

11:17.218 --> 11:19.551
and I will kick him out
of the loading dock.

11:19.620 --> 11:22.254
They might be crazy out there,
but he'll be safe.

11:22.323 --> 11:24.523
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:24.592 --> 11:26.592
I mean, if it's safe,

11:26.660 --> 11:28.961
then I'm sure you don't mind
if I crash out there,

11:29.029 --> 11:30.796
if I go with him.

11:30.910 --> 11:32.509
Not a chance in hell.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.706
Then I guess he stays.

11:49.594 --> 11:51.271
I can't sleep.

11:52.797 --> 11:54.397
Yeah, me neither.

12:01.072 --> 12:03.649
What's the worst thing
you've ever done to somebody?

12:08.913 --> 12:10.961
There was a kid.

12:12.350 --> 12:14.183
Everyone... Everyone hated him.

12:16.487 --> 12:18.309
I'd see him at school,

12:18.613 --> 12:20.854
swishing around like a little faggot.

12:24.565 --> 12:26.303
The way he looked at you,

12:26.834 --> 12:28.405
it made me sick.

12:31.369 --> 12:33.603
Knew for weeks I wanted to hurt him.

12:36.874 --> 12:40.272
Then one day after practice...

12:43.049 --> 12:44.549
he smiled at me.

12:49.821 --> 12:51.420
And then what happened?

12:53.958 --> 12:55.424
I beat him up.

12:57.894 --> 12:59.260
Took his arm,

12:59.864 --> 13:01.706
put it behind his back,

13:02.345 --> 13:03.911
and broke it.

13:06.638 --> 13:10.072
I wanted him to beg me to stop,
but he didn't.

13:13.578 --> 13:15.144
I, um...

13:16.838 --> 13:18.414
I took my dick out.

13:19.934 --> 13:22.985
I asked him, "Was this what you want?"

13:26.559 --> 13:28.213
And I pissed on him.

13:30.328 --> 13:32.190
He never told anyone.

13:34.089 --> 13:35.689
I respected that.

13:42.540 --> 13:43.939
I'm sorry.

13:45.843 --> 13:48.277
II'm so sorry.

13:51.816 --> 13:53.293
I forgive you.

14:38.923 --> 14:40.356
My God.

14:43.802 --> 14:45.051
You okay?

14:45.103 --> 14:46.869
Yeah, just make them tighter.

14:46.938 --> 14:48.337
Make them tighter.

14:50.479 --> 14:52.212
Look, no matter what happens,

14:52.343 --> 14:54.288
you don't let me out
of these things, okay,

14:54.342 --> 14:56.245
no matter how bad it gets.

14:57.747 --> 14:59.246
Thank you. Thank you.

15:12.130 --> 15:14.252
I wanted to thank you, Link.

15:16.848 --> 15:19.275
I want to thank you for your sacrifice.

15:22.140 --> 15:25.314
I want you to know
it will not be in vain.

15:28.679 --> 15:31.714
I want you to know that your faith in me

15:31.783 --> 15:35.584
continues to inspire me,
even after you're gone.

15:38.589 --> 15:44.059
It's because of that
that I now know what I must do.

15:46.135 --> 15:48.564
And I wanted to thank you for that.

15:57.141 --> 15:58.474
Goodbye, Link.

16:17.687 --> 16:19.487
May I sit?

16:24.427 --> 16:26.093
What are you reading?

16:27.497 --> 16:28.996
The Bible.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.967
I was curious. I've never read it.

16:34.604 --> 16:36.337
Lots of loose ends.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.214
Do you really believe in all this?

16:41.276 --> 16:42.877
Fallen angels?

16:43.120 --> 16:44.721
Resurrection?

16:45.362 --> 16:46.614
Yes.

16:48.918 --> 16:50.975
And you think I'm crazy?

16:51.866 --> 16:55.639
I think you're trying
to help these people,

16:56.600 --> 16:58.333
but you're leading them astray.

17:01.030 --> 17:03.864
Do you realize you have
the destiny of their souls

17:04.064 --> 17:05.665
in your hands now?

17:06.049 --> 17:08.868
If I believed in souls,
I would worry about yours.

17:10.406 --> 17:12.063
I deserve that.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.714
I knew what Link was going
to do, and I allowed it.

17:22.685 --> 17:24.752
I have prayed for forgiveness.

17:24.819 --> 17:28.185
I don't know if I will get it.

17:28.424 --> 17:32.726
All I know is that I did it
to save the people here.

17:35.475 --> 17:38.194
And if I don't continue to try,

17:39.342 --> 17:41.138
I have no reason to be alive.

17:41.370 --> 17:43.237
More violence, Father?

17:47.143 --> 17:49.410
Do you know what a trial by ordeal is?

17:49.630 --> 17:51.171
Tell me.

17:51.275 --> 17:53.343
It is a test of life and death,

17:53.436 --> 17:56.070
where the proof
of innocence is survival.

17:56.374 --> 17:58.085
What kind of test would that be?

17:58.154 --> 18:00.491
We walk into the mist, you and I.

18:01.924 --> 18:03.673
I believe God will spare me,

18:03.826 --> 18:07.016
as I am sure you believe
Nature will spare you.

18:07.402 --> 18:11.712
Whoever dies, we will provide
an answer for the people here.

18:12.501 --> 18:14.298
They will know who to follow.

18:16.472 --> 18:19.540
I'm willing to risk my life
to give them that answer.

18:20.928 --> 18:22.213
Are you?

18:56.902 --> 18:58.465
Hey. Hey.

18:58.535 --> 18:59.980
Hey, hey.

19:00.156 --> 19:01.535
Have you seen Adrian?

19:01.721 --> 19:03.397
No. Why?

19:03.444 --> 19:06.772
Well, it's just, um...
it's just he wasn't in his room.

19:06.888 --> 19:08.193
He's probably in the bathroom.

19:08.264 --> 19:10.828
Yeah, ddon't... don't waste
your time looking for him.

19:11.145 --> 19:12.578
What do you mean?

19:12.647 --> 19:15.656
He... he's not a good person.

19:18.152 --> 19:20.777
Yeah, I... I see people.

19:23.106 --> 19:26.926
Just like I saw the... the girl's
mom, Mrs. Lambert,

19:26.995 --> 19:29.553
and... and I knew she was...
she was good,

19:30.264 --> 19:32.691
and I... I... I saw him,

19:33.285 --> 19:37.183
and... and I...
and I knew that he is evil.

19:38.457 --> 19:39.690
Come on.

19:40.659 --> 19:42.659
- Adrian?
- Adrian!

19:43.883 --> 19:45.729
- Adrian.
- Adrian!

19:47.679 --> 19:49.846
- Adrian!
- Adrian!

20:01.613 --> 20:03.546
See... see, I... I told the doctor.

20:03.615 --> 20:07.016
I... I can't see people
when he gives me the medicine.

20:07.703 --> 20:10.687
You know, he... he... he's dead now,
and it is so clear.

20:12.758 --> 20:14.643
They all had evil in them.

20:14.926 --> 20:16.495
Where is Adrian?

20:16.661 --> 20:18.979
Yeah, I'm... I'm not done with him yet.

20:31.243 --> 20:33.376
Hey! Come on!

20:33.848 --> 20:35.161
Come on!

20:35.246 --> 20:37.216
Come on! Let us in.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.067
Let us in!

20:39.351 --> 20:42.051
I can't do it. Please. Please let me out.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.001
Please.

20:44.322 --> 20:45.555
Please.

20:45.624 --> 20:48.091
Please. I changed my mind.
Please let me go.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.092
Please.

20:49.161 --> 20:51.091
Please, please, let me go.

20:51.223 --> 20:52.426
You told me not to.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.528
Please. Please.

20:53.591 --> 20:55.098
Well, I change my mind.

20:55.167 --> 20:57.471
Please. Please, let me go.

20:57.636 --> 20:59.518
Jonah, please.

20:59.838 --> 21:01.815
I'm sorry.

21:02.182 --> 21:04.941
Get me the fuck out of here! Please!

21:12.107 --> 21:15.779
I... I know more about you, you know.

21:16.154 --> 21:17.823
Bryan told me everything.

21:17.870 --> 21:19.588
I know where you're from.

21:19.643 --> 21:23.092
I... I know where your parents are.

21:23.997 --> 21:25.096
Jonah?

21:25.330 --> 21:27.997
Jonah! Jonah!

21:29.401 --> 21:30.667
You're lying.

21:30.735 --> 21:33.128
No, I'm... I'm not. I'm not.

21:33.178 --> 21:34.863
I... I swear I'm not.

21:34.957 --> 21:36.290
I'm not.

21:39.778 --> 21:41.678
If you know something, tell me.

21:43.064 --> 21:45.968
When you release me, I'll tell you.

21:47.071 --> 21:49.954
- You don't know anything.
- I do. I do.

21:50.040 --> 21:53.456
Please, no!

21:58.630 --> 22:00.330
Jonah.

22:00.398 --> 22:03.199
Jonah!

22:06.382 --> 22:07.444
Jonah.

22:07.499 --> 22:08.705
Jonah!

22:11.174 --> 22:12.540
I remember something.

22:15.091 --> 22:16.291
<i>Shelley, please.</i>

22:16.339 --> 22:17.480
You should hear this.

22:17.549 --> 22:18.720
<i>You don't know them.</i>

22:18.775 --> 22:21.673
<i>You didn't stay with them.
Alex lied to us.</i>

22:21.738 --> 22:23.404
<i>Eve could be lying as well.</i>

22:23.595 --> 22:25.989
<i>That doesn't mean they've been hoarding.</i>

22:26.057 --> 22:27.891
They've had plenty of time
to gather food.

22:27.959 --> 22:29.919
For all we know, they
could have raided the stores

22:29.961 --> 22:31.739
- before we started looking.
- You don't know that.

22:31.763 --> 22:33.830
I know that she came
and asked for board games,

22:33.899 --> 22:36.032
and if that's her major concern,

22:36.101 --> 22:38.429
then it's because she
isn't worried about food.

22:38.710 --> 22:40.870
If they have more food,
they should share it with us.

22:41.031 --> 22:43.039
- I can ask if...
- You think those bitches

22:43.108 --> 22:44.741
are just gonna share it with you?

22:44.809 --> 22:47.277
You may not like them,
but there's no reason...

22:47.345 --> 22:49.211
You didn't hear what I heard.

22:49.414 --> 22:51.447
They're liars, both of them.

22:51.516 --> 22:53.649
I'm sorry about what happened to you,

22:53.952 --> 22:57.244
but if you can't behave,
then just shut your mouth.

22:57.442 --> 22:58.841
It's very simple.

23:09.034 --> 23:10.524
You didn't have to do that.

23:18.143 --> 23:20.276
Nine meals from anarchy.

23:21.939 --> 23:22.967
What?

23:23.114 --> 23:24.493
There's this theory

23:24.561 --> 23:26.528
that we're always
just nine meals from anarchy.

23:26.785 --> 23:29.986
Take away food, take away water,
nine missing meals later,

23:30.127 --> 23:32.455
that's when people
start doing bad things.

23:38.997 --> 23:39.997
Hey.

23:45.403 --> 23:46.803
You're not alone, okay?

24:00.485 --> 24:03.672
Nathalie, I can't let you do this.

24:03.789 --> 24:05.488
You don't have a choice.

24:05.690 --> 24:08.191
Father Romanov and I decided together.

24:08.259 --> 24:09.821
What if you're both wrong?

24:10.016 --> 24:11.376
- What if it's...
- If Thomas is right,

24:11.400 --> 24:12.691
then we'll die out there.

24:12.799 --> 24:16.868
But if one of us is right,
if one of us survives,

24:17.469 --> 24:19.002
then you will know who to follow.

24:20.538 --> 24:22.505
Then that person can save you.

24:28.546 --> 24:32.053
I would like a few moments
alone so I can pray.

24:32.517 --> 24:33.850
Then we should begin.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.711
I believe in you.

25:01.079 --> 25:04.380
In the name of the Father, of the son,
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

25:07.052 --> 25:11.020
Be with me now, in this hour
of need, I pray to you.

25:13.258 --> 25:16.392
In the name of the Father, of the son,
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

25:29.374 --> 25:30.978
Mrs. Raven?

25:35.447 --> 25:37.413
Mrs. Raven, are you ready?

25:43.088 --> 25:45.302
Maybe the Lord has changed her mind.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.403
By the divine power of God,

27:52.182 --> 27:56.882
cast into hell Satan
and all the evil spirits...

27:56.944 --> 27:59.971
who roam throughout the world

28:00.048 --> 28:01.455
seeking the ruin of...

28:32.326 --> 28:34.006
You gotta let us in. Let us in!

28:34.076 --> 28:36.700
Yeah, there... there's no
stronger door in the psych ward

28:36.786 --> 28:39.552
than the one that guards
their precious medicine.

28:40.122 --> 28:42.349
Come on! Hey!

28:42.418 --> 28:43.550
Hey, what's your name?

28:43.619 --> 28:45.189
What's your name?

28:45.354 --> 28:46.887
Just tell me your name.

28:48.537 --> 28:50.463
- Nash.
- Nash, listen to me.

28:50.532 --> 28:52.198
You gotta let him go.

28:52.289 --> 28:53.771
We'll take him out of here. I promise.

28:53.795 --> 28:55.015
- I don't know. I... I... I...
- I need you to let him go.

28:55.039 --> 28:58.203
- I can't let you do that.
- Please! He's just a kid.

28:58.796 --> 29:00.240
I know him. He's just a kid.

29:00.308 --> 29:02.475
No, look, this... this is
not how this works, okay?

29:02.544 --> 29:04.310
The kid has to die.

29:07.716 --> 29:09.182
I remember it now.

29:09.251 --> 29:10.717
Bird.

29:13.221 --> 29:15.121
I'm in so much pain.

29:15.190 --> 29:17.529
They kept me locked up.

29:19.084 --> 29:20.493
A woman... A woman came.

29:20.562 --> 29:21.761
Smile.

29:23.131 --> 29:24.294
Please.

29:24.357 --> 29:27.534
She... she started saying words to me.

29:27.602 --> 29:29.356
Bike.

29:29.571 --> 29:31.070
Random words.

29:31.139 --> 29:32.405
Lamp.

29:34.411 --> 29:38.880
I don't know why, but the words...

29:39.147 --> 29:41.247
the words would take me
through the pain.

29:43.997 --> 29:45.451
Listen to me!

29:45.520 --> 29:49.403
Listen. Listen to me.

29:50.704 --> 29:52.548
When she spoke,

29:53.260 --> 29:57.134
I would feel the word
instead of the pain.

29:57.422 --> 29:59.489
Table.

29:59.668 --> 30:00.934
Orange.

30:02.671 --> 30:03.671
Pen.

30:04.706 --> 30:06.172
And I got through it.

30:06.241 --> 30:08.027
Pearl.

30:09.344 --> 30:10.443
Stoplight.

30:10.636 --> 30:12.832
So will you.

30:13.315 --> 30:15.281
Feline.

30:15.350 --> 30:16.683
Just listen to me

30:16.758 --> 30:19.031
- I can't...
- Listen to my voice.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.187
Mist.

30:31.066 --> 30:32.198
Thank you.

30:35.003 --> 30:36.536
You're very kind.

30:38.506 --> 30:40.639
What happened out there?

30:41.309 --> 30:42.608
We couldn't see you.

30:42.777 --> 30:44.398
Nothing happened.

30:45.347 --> 30:47.854
I just stood there with my eyes closed.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.527
And everything happened.

30:57.125 --> 30:59.335
I could hear him die,

31:00.195 --> 31:02.632
and he was in so much pain.

31:04.866 --> 31:08.071
But out there in the mist,
it all sounds different,

31:08.521 --> 31:10.571
and it was beautiful.

31:11.506 --> 31:14.140
And it was like the sound
of a strange bird

31:14.209 --> 31:16.509
or a glacier breaking.

31:18.513 --> 31:19.812
I felt it all.

31:21.716 --> 31:23.716
I felt Nature take Romanov,

31:23.785 --> 31:26.753
just like she took Link and Mikhail.

31:27.964 --> 31:29.922
I felt her sensing me.

31:32.227 --> 31:34.327
She knows I'm not a threat.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.164
She knows I am her messenger.

31:41.102 --> 31:42.797
Please!

31:43.271 --> 31:44.404
No! Hey!

31:44.472 --> 31:45.938
Nash, how does it work?

31:46.007 --> 31:47.140
How does it work?

31:47.208 --> 31:48.295
Tell me, how does it work?

31:48.356 --> 31:50.944
Well, it... it... it travels, okay?

31:51.014 --> 31:55.725
It... It travels from... from,
from person to person.

31:56.017 --> 31:57.350
And this is my fault.

31:57.419 --> 31:59.573
Why? Why is it your fault?

31:59.888 --> 32:01.355
Tell me why it's your fault.

32:01.526 --> 32:05.042
The... The, The nun at my school,

32:05.393 --> 32:08.061
she showed it to me. Okay?

32:08.129 --> 32:10.797
The... The evil, was inside of her.

32:11.864 --> 32:15.428
She asked me to beat it
out of her, and I did...

32:17.472 --> 32:18.938
and I let it out.

32:21.376 --> 32:22.542
I let it out.

32:24.713 --> 32:26.760
Listen to me. Listen to me, Nash.

32:26.815 --> 32:28.281
It is not in him.

32:28.349 --> 32:31.482
- It is not inside Adrian.
- YYYou can't see it,

32:31.560 --> 32:34.232
because you didn't let it out,
okay? I did.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.656
I did.

32:38.827 --> 32:40.727
I have to fight it.

32:43.490 --> 32:45.531
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Hey! Nash, no!

32:45.600 --> 32:48.426
He's not evil! He's not the evil one!
I can... I can prove it.

32:48.496 --> 32:51.801
Nash, I can prove it. I can prove it.
He's not the evil one.

32:53.775 --> 32:55.007
How?

32:56.644 --> 32:58.077
Because I am.

33:06.724 --> 33:08.023
You're lying.

33:08.093 --> 33:09.802
I'm not.

33:10.043 --> 33:11.175
Then prove it.

33:11.505 --> 33:12.993
Let me in, and I will.

33:13.142 --> 33:15.368
Yeah. Yeah, you see, you see,

33:15.392 --> 33:18.072
you are just like
all the rest of them?

33:18.221 --> 33:19.681
You try and trick me.

33:19.741 --> 33:21.374
Look me in the eye.

33:21.986 --> 33:24.301
Look me in the eye, Nash!

33:24.694 --> 33:27.309
Look me in the eye, and tell me
you don't see evil.

33:33.837 --> 33:35.588
I don't believe you.

33:35.838 --> 33:38.172
All right, then, do it.

33:38.742 --> 33:39.808
Do it!

33:40.377 --> 33:41.846
Hurt him.

33:42.534 --> 33:45.220
He's weak. He disgusts me.
I want to see him suffer.

33:46.230 --> 33:47.615
Yeah?

33:47.753 --> 33:49.050
What else?

33:49.363 --> 33:50.886
What else do you want?

33:53.042 --> 33:55.701
I want to find the boy
who raped my daughter.

33:57.443 --> 33:59.443
And what will you do to him?

34:02.107 --> 34:04.833
I want to... I want
to put him on his knees.

34:07.270 --> 34:10.737
I want... I want to reach
inside him with my whole hand...

34:12.627 --> 34:14.460
and I want to reach down his throat.

34:15.563 --> 34:16.790
And then what?

34:16.886 --> 34:20.259
I want to reach into his stomach
and pull out his intestines.

34:21.313 --> 34:23.856
I want him to try to scream,

34:24.418 --> 34:26.254
but he can't make a sound.

34:28.725 --> 34:30.692
And I won't stop.

34:32.161 --> 34:34.803
And I want him to be in pain forever.

34:35.465 --> 34:37.630
I want him to suffer,

34:38.134 --> 34:39.934
to regret...

34:42.576 --> 34:44.005
to beg.

34:45.475 --> 34:47.275
I want him to beg me.

34:49.112 --> 34:53.181
And then I want him to learn
that there will be no salvation.

34:55.518 --> 34:58.386
And I want to look him in
the eye when he realizes that.

35:04.995 --> 35:08.110
Okay. You can come in.

35:24.114 --> 35:26.514
It's all right.

35:26.583 --> 35:27.815
I got you.

35:29.552 --> 35:30.885
Come on.

35:40.422 --> 35:42.977
You need a shower. You smell like shit.

35:45.086 --> 35:46.567
Fuck you.

36:09.492 --> 36:12.327
All right, you... you walk in.
You go to the other side of the room.

36:19.369 --> 36:20.369
Let him go.

36:27.583 --> 36:29.416
We don't have to do this.

36:29.713 --> 36:32.754
What else is there to do
than to fight the evil?

36:33.802 --> 36:35.769
What else is there in life?

37:14.491 --> 37:15.523
It's in you.

37:18.521 --> 37:20.361
It's really in you.

37:45.790 --> 37:48.790
I'm gonna go find Bryan and Mia,
and then we're getting out of here.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.379
You got a plan, Chief?

38:18.455 --> 38:19.921
Didn't think so.

38:21.724 --> 38:23.257
Looks like we're gonna die here.

38:23.326 --> 38:24.579
Kyle, please.

38:24.683 --> 38:26.376
What are you gonna say?

38:26.983 --> 38:28.516
That we got a couple days' food left?

38:29.799 --> 38:31.799
Who cares if it's two or three days?

38:31.868 --> 38:33.126
It doesn't matter.

38:37.974 --> 38:40.908
What if there's a reason
the mist is here?

38:42.178 --> 38:44.330
Don't you think it's strange?

38:45.205 --> 38:49.678
Everyone who's gone into
the mist has died, except her,

38:50.386 --> 38:51.986
except Alex.

38:52.366 --> 38:53.889
The mist didn't want her.

38:53.951 --> 38:55.957
Shelley, we talked about this.

38:56.461 --> 38:58.492
Something's wrong with them.

38:59.703 --> 39:01.296
When did all this start?

39:02.382 --> 39:04.031
It started when she lied,

39:04.671 --> 39:06.834
when she lied about being raped.

39:06.903 --> 39:10.049
I think we all need
to calm down, get some sleep.

39:10.123 --> 39:12.549
I think we need to find a solution.

39:16.058 --> 39:18.479
Unless you all want to die here.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.386
You okay?

39:26.756 --> 39:27.989
Are you?

39:32.562 --> 39:34.962
Do you know what I thought of in there?

39:37.467 --> 39:39.901
I had never held a guy's hand.

39:41.104 --> 39:42.837
I always wanted to...

39:44.140 --> 39:45.973
but you know how people are.

39:52.030 --> 39:54.084
I thought he was gonna kill me,

39:55.077 --> 39:57.592
so I promised myself,

39:58.459 --> 40:02.012
if I survived, I would do that.

40:04.327 --> 40:06.160
I would hold a guy's hand.

40:11.734 --> 40:13.034
I would hold it...

40:16.406 --> 40:17.905
walk down the street,

40:17.974 --> 40:20.208
and not give a shit
about what anybody thought.

40:25.081 --> 40:27.114
Who cares, right?

40:54.777 --> 40:55.937
Hey.

40:56.039 --> 40:57.144
You guys coming?

40:58.681 --> 41:01.816
I, um... I think I'm gonna stay here.

41:02.093 --> 41:05.987
- What?
- I'll be, um... be safe here,

41:06.055 --> 41:10.400
and it's close to my home,
so, um, after this is over,

41:10.463 --> 41:13.828
I could go back to, um, normal.

41:16.499 --> 41:17.499
Adrian, come on.

41:19.369 --> 41:21.168
Adrian, let's go.

41:25.008 --> 41:26.073
You sure?

41:32.015 --> 41:33.347
Tyler, last chance.
