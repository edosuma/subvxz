WEBVTT

00:03.294 --> 00:04.336
- Phoebe.
- Yeah?

00:04.504 --> 00:07.381
Look at that guy by the window. Wow!

00:07.549 --> 00:11.552
He's awfully short.
And I think he's talking to himself.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.596
And to be completely honest,
he's not that good in bed.

00:16.099 --> 00:20.561
Ugh, what is wrong with me lately?
It's, like, every guy I see.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.688
Look at that guy, for example.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.066
Normally that's not someone
that I would be attracted to.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.110
But right now,
with the way I'm feeling...

00:28.278 --> 00:32.448
...all I wanna do is rip off
his sweatpants and fanny pack.

00:33.158 --> 00:36.869
Wait a second! This is about
the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?

00:37.037 --> 00:38.996
- Yeah.
- This is completely normal.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.665
Around the fourth month,
your hormones go crazy.

00:41.833 --> 00:45.044
- Really? So this happened to you?
- Absolutely, yeah.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.671
And keep in mind, I was carrying triplets.

00:47.839 --> 00:52.217
So in medical terms,
I was thrice as randy.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.137
Wow, this explains so much.

00:55.305 --> 01:00.184
Last weekend, I went from store
to store, sitting on Santas' laps.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.270
Yeah, I remember trying to steal...

01:03.438 --> 01:06.398
...a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield
from a Footlocker.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.984
- Ugh.
- Yeah, ugh.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.987
I go see my doctor tomorrow.
I'll ask her about this.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.239
Maybe she can give me
a pill or something.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.909
Yeah, that's what you need.
A good pill.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.324
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:57.492 --> 01:58.909
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.953
Look, I got our pictures developed.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.706
Oh, great. Joey, wanna check out
pictures of me and Mona ice-skating?

02:04.874 --> 02:11.130
Oh, uh, ordinarily I would love to,
but I am just swamped right now.

02:15.593 --> 02:19.388
Where are the pictures that creepy
pretzel vendor took of us together?

02:19.556 --> 02:22.015
Oh, yeah. Probably at the end.

02:22.183 --> 02:26.311
Oh, my God. All he took
were pictures of my breasts!

02:26.479 --> 02:28.230
I'm missing picture time?

02:33.528 --> 02:36.029
You know, she has a face, Ross.

02:37.407 --> 02:41.827
- Okay, here's a good one of us.
- Wow, that is a good one.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.204
Wow, It looks like a holiday card...

02:44.372 --> 02:48.292
...with the tree in the middle
and the skaters and the snow. Heh.

02:48.459 --> 02:51.086
Every year I say I'll send cards
and I never do it.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.714
Do you wanna send
this one out together?

02:58.303 --> 03:01.638
Together? Like, to people?

03:01.806 --> 03:05.559
Yeah, "Happy Holidays,
from Mona and Ross." it'll be cute. Okay?

03:05.727 --> 03:08.353
Heh. Uh, okay.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.315
- Oh, I gotta get to work. Call me later?
- Sure.

03:11.482 --> 03:12.858
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.318
- Bye.
- Yeah.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.406
Congratulations! You just got married!

03:20.450 --> 03:22.326
I know. Can you believe that?

03:22.493 --> 03:25.412
I'm sorry. What's the big deal
about a holiday card?

03:25.580 --> 03:29.249
Married couples send out cards.
Families send out cards.

03:29.417 --> 03:33.629
People who've been dating a few months
do not send out cards. Is she crazy?

03:33.796 --> 03:36.256
Hey, hey, hey.
That's your wife you're talking about.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.970
- Bing! Ho, and the Bingette!
- Ah, heh.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.806
- Honey, you remember my boss, Doug.
- Yes. Hi.

03:44.974 --> 03:49.394
So, good news, the divorce is final.
I signed the papers this a.m.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.022
I didn't know you were getting
a divorce. I'm sorry.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.359
Heh, sorry? Finally chewed my leg out
of that bear trap.

03:56.653 --> 04:01.365
- Hey! Congratulations to you guys.
- Heh. No leg-chewing for us.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.200
Well, give it time.

04:04.452 --> 04:08.622
So! The divorce, the marriage,
we got a lot to celebrate.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.667
How about we go out to dinner
tomorrow night?

04:11.834 --> 04:14.336
I can't think
of anything we're doing.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.380
Why can't I think of anything
we're doing?

04:17.548 --> 04:20.384
Tomorrow night it is.
I should be out of court by 6.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.678
They keep throwing sexual harassment
cases at me...

04:22.845 --> 04:25.847
...and I keep knocking them
out of the park! Ha-ha-ha.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.058
Okay, see you tomorrow.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.019
Just so you know,
we're not seeing him tomorrow.

04:32.021 --> 04:34.106
I cannot spend another evening
with that man.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.275
Remember how he behaved
at our wedding?

04:36.442 --> 04:38.694
- No.
- Because he wasn't invited.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.905
Because of the way he behaved
at our engagement party.

04:42.073 --> 04:46.326
Oh, yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through
an ice sculpture, doesn't it?

04:52.583 --> 04:54.293
- Hi!
- Hey.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.503
Hey, I went by the photo shop.
Take a look.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.298
Here is a mockup of our card.
What do you think?

05:02.343 --> 05:04.428
Huh. Wow, this is great.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.514
Now, do you think it should say,
"Love, Ross and Mona"?

05:08.641 --> 05:12.686
Well, we haven't said that
to each other yet...

05:13.604 --> 05:17.107
...but I guess it's okay
to say it to other people.

05:17.275 --> 05:21.570
- How many did you want? I'm getting 100.
- A hundred? Ha-ha-ha.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.783
Well, I, uh, guess I'll take, uh...

05:26.951 --> 05:28.785
Mona?

05:29.329 --> 05:34.916
Uh, I don't... I'm not sure
about the whole, uh, card thing.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.585
Really? Why not?

05:37.503 --> 05:41.506
Sending out a holiday card together?

05:41.674 --> 05:46.261
I just don't know
if we're really quite there yet.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.349
I didn't think of it that way.
You're right. You're right.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.147
- So can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.649
- Where are we?
- Huh?

06:01.110 --> 06:05.238
You know, where are we?
Where is this relationship going?

06:09.452 --> 06:11.370
Hmm.

06:11.537 --> 06:16.166
I mean, I love spending time with you.
I hope we're moving forward.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.543
We should talk about that,
don't you think?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.471
Let's do the card!

06:30.807 --> 06:34.476
- What?
- The card! I think we're there.

06:35.019 --> 06:38.688
Okay, but I still think
we should have this conversation.

06:38.856 --> 06:43.985
Really? I mean, even with the card?

06:47.824 --> 06:48.990
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.828
Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here
today. She was called to the hospital.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.663
So Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.250
Okay. Can I ask you a question?

06:58.418 --> 07:03.046
Was it me, or was the guy who
took my blood sample really cute? Heh.

07:03.214 --> 07:07.509
You know who I'm talking about?
Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?

07:09.220 --> 07:14.474
- Hi, Rachel. I'm Dr. Schiff.
- Yes, you are.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.977
So how's it going?

07:17.145 --> 07:20.689
Oh, it's really good.
But enough about me! Come on. Heh.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.859
Where are you from? What do you do?

07:25.194 --> 07:27.988
- I'm a doctor.
- Right. I meant...

07:28.156 --> 07:31.533
...you know, in your spare time.
Do you cook? Ski?

07:31.701 --> 07:34.703
Or hang out with your wife
or girlfriend?

07:34.871 --> 07:38.206
Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend,
but I do ski.

07:38.374 --> 07:42.586
I love to ski! How amazing is this?

07:43.379 --> 07:47.883
- Are you experiencing any discomfort?
- No, I'm very comfortable.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.470
- Any painful gas?
- No!

07:52.763 --> 07:57.142
Ew, Dr. Schiff!
What kind of question is that?

07:57.894 --> 08:00.896
Okay, then. Would you like
to lie down on the table?

08:01.063 --> 08:03.899
Would you like me
to lie down on the table?

08:05.067 --> 08:08.487
- Sorry, is there something going on here?
- Do you feel it too?

08:13.159 --> 08:15.285
- Hi.
- Oh, hey. So...

08:15.453 --> 08:18.497
...how did your doctor's appointment go?
- Well, let's see.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.124
Uh, they gave me
"cute boy" doctor today.

08:21.292 --> 08:26.046
In the middle of the exam
I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.965
- Oh, my God!
- Why did you do that?

08:29.133 --> 08:33.094
Okay, remember that problem I was having
during my fourth month of pregnancy?

08:33.261 --> 08:36.264
Oh, yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase.

08:36.432 --> 08:40.519
Oh, man. You were so hard up,
you practically came on to me.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.979
You wish!

08:43.272 --> 08:45.315
Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.152
Oh, yeah? Come and get it.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.072
Okay, even this is turning me on.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.450
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

08:55.618 --> 08:59.120
Hey, Ross. How's it going
with you and Mona?

08:59.288 --> 09:01.456
You guys still together?

09:02.208 --> 09:06.461
Oh, yeah, we're moving forward.
You'll be getting our card.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.673
You and Mona
are doing a holiday card together?

09:09.840 --> 09:11.132
We're not just doing a card.

09:11.300 --> 09:15.011
She also wants to have the conversation
about where the relationship is going.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.305
Ugh, women.

09:18.015 --> 09:21.643
I know! Why do you guys need
to have this conversation, huh?

09:21.811 --> 09:25.522
No self-respecting man would ask a woman,
"So where is this going?"

09:25.690 --> 09:27.482
Uh, Ross, you asked me that.

09:27.650 --> 09:31.736
Hey, you were a closed book, okay?
I'm not a mind reader!

09:33.030 --> 09:38.451
Besides, I hate those conversations.
I'm horrible at them, really.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.121
Maybe I need some kind of a gesture.

09:41.289 --> 09:44.916
Something that says we're moving forward
without having to talk about it.

09:45.084 --> 09:49.754
- Like asking her to move in with you?
- Wha...? Ha. Smaller than that.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.550
- Making her a mix tape?
- Uh, bigger than that.

09:53.718 --> 09:57.804
- Give her a key to your apartment.
- Whoa, hello. We were closer with the tape.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.516
Have you said "I love you"?
Say, "I love you."

10:01.684 --> 10:04.853
I don't... I don't think I'm quite there yet.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.481
But, oh, I could say,
"I love spending time with you."

10:08.649 --> 10:11.234
- No, we hate that.
- That is a slap in the face.

10:11.402 --> 10:16.656
Oh, forget it. You know what?
I'll just have the conversation.

10:16.824 --> 10:21.703
I'll just say, "I like things the way
they are," and hope for the best.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.122
What do you think, Rach?

10:24.373 --> 10:27.626
I think if it was
a little colder in here...

10:27.793 --> 10:30.420
...I could see your nipples
through that sweater.

10:35.092 --> 10:38.053
Bing, we're all set for tonight. 8:00.

10:38.220 --> 10:41.264
Oh, uh, as it turns out, we can't do it.
Monica has to work.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.309
Oh. My ex-wife didn't work.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.395
Unless you call turning
into her mother "work."

10:48.230 --> 10:51.524
Now, fine. Tomorrow night, then.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.235
Oh, uh, well,
tomorrow's no good for her, either.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.445
Oh? Why not?

10:56.656 --> 10:58.740
It's the semifinals...

10:58.908 --> 11:00.492
...of her...

11:00.660 --> 11:03.244
...bocce ball tournament.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.997
- Ahem.
- What's going on, Bing?

11:06.165 --> 11:10.335
Does, uh, your wife have a problem
with me, or something?

11:10.503 --> 11:13.213
Well now you're just talking crazy.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.424
Then why can't the three of us
go out together?

11:16.592 --> 11:19.761
Because, uh, we split up.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.055
Monica and I split up.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.224
Hold me.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.602
Good God, Bing.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.313
Well, I can't say
I'm altogether surprised.

11:30.481 --> 11:34.609
I saw the way she looked at you,
and there was no love there.

11:36.529 --> 11:40.281
And the way she looked at me,
pure lust.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.909
What would help me
through this tough time...

11:43.077 --> 11:45.370
...is choking someone.
Can I choke you?

11:46.288 --> 11:49.541
Bing, my boy,
we're gonna get you over this.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.253
Here's the plan: Grab your coat,
we're going to a strip club!

11:53.421 --> 11:55.338
Oh, no, Monica would freak.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.925
But to hell with that bitch!

12:02.722 --> 12:04.639
Here we go.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.016
Ah, Mona, um...

12:07.184 --> 12:12.188
...I think it's time we had a conversation
about where things are with us.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.024
Yeah, I think I suggested that.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.862
Heh. Uh, we are so...

12:21.824 --> 12:24.117
So, um...

12:24.285 --> 12:26.119
...well, I really like you.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.998
And I love, um, you know,
hanging out with you.

12:30.166 --> 12:34.335
And I'm having a lot of fun.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.467
Okay.

12:40.634 --> 12:45.638
I mean, there's no point in spending time
with someone if it's just fun.

12:45.806 --> 12:50.059
- It's gotta be going somewhere, right?
- Ha, ha.

12:50.227 --> 12:53.188
So where is it going?

12:55.691 --> 12:57.233
Ah.

12:58.360 --> 13:02.238
That's the real question.

13:05.075 --> 13:08.369
And the answer is...

13:08.537 --> 13:11.873
...it's going somewhere...

13:12.666 --> 13:14.667
...fun.

13:15.920 --> 13:20.715
I know what you're thinking.
Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.760
- Ha-ha-ha.
- But you're not getting any younger.

13:24.887 --> 13:29.849
No, I mean, not you. Not you.
You are getting younger!

13:31.227 --> 13:36.606
You look like you're getting younger
by the second. What's your secret?

13:38.734 --> 13:41.945
I'm sorry, so, uh, where are we?

13:42.112 --> 13:44.280
Well, to sum up:

13:48.160 --> 13:53.456
We're having fun. You look young.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.171
- Okay...
- But that's not enough.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.135
So, heh, so...

14:07.596 --> 14:11.641
...here's a key to my apartment.

14:12.184 --> 14:15.270
- Really?
- Really.

14:16.897 --> 14:20.316
- You don't think this is too fast?
- Mm-mm.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.241
You gave her a key
to your apartment?

14:28.409 --> 14:32.078
Not just a key,
I gave her the only key!

14:34.456 --> 14:38.793
I am now a homeless person
in a very serious relationship.

14:41.422 --> 14:46.342
- Oh, Ross, how'd the conversation go?
- Great. I live on the street.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.844
Where?

14:49.889 --> 14:50.930
- Hey!
- Hi.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.975
Okay, Monica, Rachel,
this is my friend Roger.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.977
- Hi, Roger.
- Hi, Roger.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.104
- Hi.
- So, um, I'm gonna get us some drinks.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.480
- Okay.
- Could you help me?

14:59.648 --> 15:02.066
Yeah, okay.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.283
Um, he's here to have sex with you.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.331
- What?
- You're welcome.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.000
Phoebe, no!

15:19.168 --> 15:21.002
It's okay. He's a virgin.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.926
Rachel, um, I was talking to this guy...

15:28.093 --> 15:30.470
...and I think he'll have sex with you.
- Okay...

15:31.013 --> 15:33.348
- Yeah, okay. Let's leave these two alone.
- Aah!

15:33.515 --> 15:36.017
No. I don't care
what my hormones are doing.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.145
I'm not gonna just do it
with some random guy.

15:39.730 --> 15:43.483
Fine. Then you tell Roger.
He was really looking forward to this.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.712
Ooh, Bing, look at those twin sisters
dancing together.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.925
Let me buy you a lap dance
with those girls, huh?

16:09.093 --> 16:13.346
That's all right, sir.
And that's just one girl.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.557
Bing, what's this?

16:16.725 --> 16:20.311
It's a hand. It's a thing you use
as a Jack and Coke holder.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.147
No, it's a wedding ring.
You gotta get rid of it.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.525
We're gonna go to the East River
and throw it in!

16:25.693 --> 16:27.151
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Yeah, yeah!

16:27.319 --> 16:29.237
I did, and I felt a hell of a lot better!

16:29.405 --> 16:32.448
If you whip it right,
you might hit a seagull in the head.

16:34.576 --> 16:38.204
Okay. Oh, I'm gonna need
a bunch of extra keys.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.624
Apparently, I give them away
for no reason at all.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.630
Hey, Ross, what's going on?
You changing the lock?

16:47.798 --> 16:49.257
No, heh.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.384
That guy is.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.760
I don't understand.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.805
You give me a key to your apartment
and then change the lock?

16:56.390 --> 16:59.726
- Uh...
- Good luck, buddy.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.521
Um, I thought we were moving forward.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.276
And now you're sending me
all these mixed signals.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.111
What are you trying to tell me?

17:11.780 --> 17:14.574
I'm trying to tell you...

17:15.867 --> 17:18.618
...I made you a mix tape.

17:19.954 --> 17:22.457
- What?
- I love you.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.917
Oh! Aww!

17:26.086 --> 17:27.627
Heh, oh.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.257
And I love spending time with you.

17:37.598 --> 17:41.893
- Hi, honey, I'm home.
- From the tequila factory?

17:42.936 --> 17:44.270
It was awful.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.774
To get out of dinner with Doug,
I told him you and I split up.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.985
So he took me to all these strip clubs
and sleazy bars.

17:51.153 --> 17:55.907
And when I wouldn't give him my wedding
ring, he threw a soda can at a bird.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.285
Come here.
I can breathe through my mouth.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.623
Know what the worst part was?

18:03.791 --> 18:06.834
I got to see what my life
would be like without you.

18:07.002 --> 18:10.797
It was like It's a Wonderful Life
with lap dances.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.760
Please promise me
that you'll never leave me...

18:15.928 --> 18:20.640
...that we'll grow old together,
and be with each other the rest of our lives.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.517
I promise.

18:24.186 --> 18:28.356
Hey, speaking of together, how about
we send out a holiday card this year?

18:28.857 --> 18:31.275
Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.491
Yes, I'd like to order a pizza.
Can I ask you a question?

18:38.659 --> 18:44.122
Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?
Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."

18:44.289 --> 18:46.916
- I'll call you back.
- Who was that?

18:47.084 --> 18:51.504
- Just the pizza place.
- You hung up on the pizza place?

18:51.672 --> 18:53.840
I don't hang up on your friends.

18:54.716 --> 18:58.302
- Sorry, I'm just having a rough day.
- Oh. What's wrong?

18:58.470 --> 19:02.723
- Oh, you really don't wanna hear about it.
- Then why did I ask?

19:02.891 --> 19:05.601
Okay. It's just that
this is really embarrassing.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.979
But lately with this pregnancy thing...

19:08.147 --> 19:11.816
...I'm just finding myself...

19:11.984 --> 19:14.735
How do I put this? Um...

19:15.112 --> 19:17.029
Erotically charged.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.951
Is that college talk for "horny"?

19:22.703 --> 19:25.913
Yeah. So, you know,
I have all of these feelings...

19:26.081 --> 19:27.999
...and I don't know
what to do about them.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.084
Because I can't date
like a normal person.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.211
Which is fine,
I don't need a relationship.

19:32.379 --> 19:36.299
All I really want is one great night.
Just sex.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.260
You know?
No strings attached. No relationship.

19:39.428 --> 19:43.973
Just with someone I feel comfortable with
and who knows what he's doing.

19:44.141 --> 19:49.687
For just one great night.
I mean, is that really so hard...

19:51.106 --> 19:53.399
...to find?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.239
So how was your day?

20:00.407 --> 20:04.702
Good. I, uh, saw a pretty big pigeon.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.585
I gotta get up early,
and it's almost 7:00.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.795
Yeah, I gotta go to my room too.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.298
- Okay, good night.
- Good night!

20:20.135 --> 20:22.762
- I can't do it!
- I didn't ask you to!

20:22.930 --> 20:24.347
- You're Rachel!
- You're Joey!

20:24.514 --> 20:27.266
- You're my friend! Yeah.
- Right back at you.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.770
Plus, it would be wrong,
and weird and bad!

20:30.938 --> 20:34.899
So bad! I don't know what you're talking
about. I didn't ask you to do anything.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.235
I know!

20:45.827 --> 20:47.203
- You wanna do it?
- No!

20:47.371 --> 20:51.207
- Me neither, I'm just testing you!
- That's the end of this conversation!

20:51.375 --> 20:53.918
- This conversation never happened.
- Never happened.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.212
- Good night.
- Good night!

21:02.511 --> 21:03.970
Get back in there!

21:10.852 --> 21:15.731
Hi. Listen, ahem, I'm sorry about
that whole thing with Roger.

21:15.899 --> 21:18.609
It really wasn't right,
and I wanna make it up to you.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.612
So, um, I brought you something...

21:21.780 --> 21:24.115
...that I think you'll really enjoy. Okay.

21:31.790 --> 21:37.295
Now this is just a loan, okay?
I'm gonna want him back. So...

21:38.338 --> 21:40.256
I'm gonna go now.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.430
I'm sorry, I thought I could do it,
and I can't.
