00:08.683 --> 00:10.885
Welcome
to Fernville,

00:10.919 --> 00:13.255
where your dreams can come true,

00:13.289 --> 00:16.258
if you believe and
want it badly enough.

00:16.292 --> 00:17.625
Fernville's
finally hosting

00:17.659 --> 00:19.095
a singing competition, you guys.

00:19.128 --> 00:20.329
I can't wait.

00:20.362 --> 00:22.597
My biggest dream is to
participate

00:22.630 --> 00:24.899
and sing the best I ever sang.

00:24.933 --> 00:27.403
Are you gonna sign up for
the singing competition, Ronda?

00:27.436 --> 00:30.573
It's open to all animals,
even if you're not a bird.

00:30.605 --> 00:33.641
I'm thinking of
entering the competition.

00:33.675 --> 00:38.447
I do love to sing, even though
I do it in private mostly,

00:38.481 --> 00:39.781
but I'm getting better.

00:39.814 --> 00:41.517
I'll have to tell
my Uncle Polly.

00:41.550 --> 00:44.386
He migrated to
Florida last winter.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.888
He'll probably fly
back in for this.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.990
Does he still do the
Tony Bennet impression?

00:49.023 --> 00:50.925
Every Friday and
Saturday night

00:50.959 --> 00:52.827
at Beak Beach's
Wings and Things.

00:52.861 --> 00:53.695
Cool.

00:53.728 --> 00:55.364
You should totally sign up.

00:55.397 --> 00:58.066
It'll be fun with all
three of us competing.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.869
Maybe we could even
perform as a trio.

01:00.902 --> 01:02.371
Wow, yeah.

01:02.404 --> 01:04.240
Oh, I don't know about that,

01:04.273 --> 01:07.709
I'd probably ruin both
your chances. I'm a gorilla,

01:07.742 --> 01:10.312
and I've never sung in front
of an audience in my life,

01:10.346 --> 01:14.383
only under the waterfall,
all by myself.

01:14.416 --> 01:17.153
Hey, I'll bet the acoustics
are great under a waterfall.

01:17.186 --> 01:19.388
It probably lends your
voice out really deep

01:19.421 --> 01:21.022
and super rich tone.

01:21.055 --> 01:22.258
I gotta try that.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.426
It's deep and rich, all right.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.630
It makes me sound like
even more of a brute.

01:27.662 --> 01:29.831
If I beat my chest with my fist,

01:29.864 --> 01:33.369
you'd expect Tarzan to
swing by on his vines.

01:33.402 --> 01:35.837
Oh Ronda, don't be
so hard on yourself.

01:35.870 --> 01:38.641
I'm sure your
voice is just lovely.

01:38.673 --> 01:39.941
Lovely.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.277
Right.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.546
Well listen, in this world,
you can do

01:43.579 --> 01:46.282
anything you put
your mind to, we all can.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.517
All you gotta do is
want it, prepare for it,

01:48.551 --> 01:50.119
and give it your best shot.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.353
That's right.

01:51.387 --> 01:54.190
I for one can't wait to
hear you sing, Ronda,

01:54.223 --> 01:57.526
and if you'd like to perform
with us, I'm all for it.

01:57.560 --> 02:00.995
Aww, shucks, thanks, you guys.

02:01.029 --> 02:04.065
You sure know how to
make a gal feel better.

02:04.099 --> 02:05.201
Come on.

02:05.234 --> 02:07.670
Let's go find out how we
sign up for this competition.

02:07.702 --> 02:09.837
I think try-outs
are coming soon.

02:09.871 --> 02:10.705

02:43.272 --> 02:44.707
You write that yourself?

02:44.739 --> 02:48.077
Oh, I didn't know
anyone was listening.

02:48.110 --> 02:49.978
I'm always listening, kid.

02:50.011 --> 02:52.381
It's my job to listen.

02:52.414 --> 02:54.149
Allow me to introduce myself.

02:54.183 --> 02:56.017
My name's Ace Saltlick.

02:56.050 --> 03:00.422
I'm a talent scout from the
famous producer, Marlon Pintop.

03:00.456 --> 03:02.124
You probably heard of him.

03:02.157 --> 03:03.225
Probably?

03:03.259 --> 03:05.094
Who hasn't heard
of Marlon Pintop?

03:05.127 --> 03:07.663
Actually, I heard he was dead.

03:07.696 --> 03:08.631
Dead?

03:08.664 --> 03:09.598
Marlon?

03:09.632 --> 03:11.065
That's crazy talk.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.235
Don't believe
everything you read, kid,

03:13.269 --> 03:16.405
especially in
those hippo papers.

03:16.438 --> 03:18.440
Dirt rags, all of 'em.

03:18.474 --> 03:21.210
Mr. Pintop took
an extended vacation

03:21.243 --> 03:23.245
in Barbados, that's all.

03:23.279 --> 03:25.847
Guy doesn't release a hit
single for three months,

03:25.880 --> 03:28.883
and these losers
are writing him off.

03:28.916 --> 03:30.252
Marlon's slipping.

03:30.286 --> 03:32.688
Marlon's losing his touch.

03:32.721 --> 03:33.855
We've heard it all.

03:33.888 --> 03:35.457
Now, Marlon's dead.

03:36.325 --> 03:38.294
I can't wait to tell him that
one.

03:38.327 --> 03:42.231
The boss gets a kick out of
these things, let me tell ya.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.699
What's your name?

03:43.732 --> 03:44.600
I'm Tiny.

03:45.467 --> 03:46.535
No, really.

03:46.568 --> 03:47.369
It is.

03:47.403 --> 03:48.203
I'm Tiny.

03:48.237 --> 03:49.804
My name is Tiny.

03:49.837 --> 03:51.240
Any questions?

03:52.107 --> 03:54.376
Pleasure to meet ya, Tiny.

03:54.410 --> 03:55.477
Likewise.

03:55.511 --> 03:58.846
So, is Marlon working on
anything new?

03:58.880 --> 03:59.715
Marlon?

03:59.748 --> 04:01.350
Working on anything new?

04:01.383 --> 04:06.188
Kid, Marlon's got 10 plates
in the air at any given time.

04:06.221 --> 04:07.289
Pick one.

04:07.323 --> 04:10.125
Oh, that's so good to
hear, I loved his albums

04:10.159 --> 04:13.462
with Justin Timberwolf, they
were my favorites growing up.

04:13.495 --> 04:15.230
You and everyone else, kid.

04:15.264 --> 04:17.466
You and everyone else.

04:17.499 --> 04:18.933
I got news for you.

04:18.966 --> 04:22.471
They collaboratin' again,
as we speak.

04:23.339 --> 04:24.139
Really?

04:24.173 --> 04:24.972
Really.

04:25.006 --> 04:26.408
But that's between you and me.

04:26.442 --> 04:27.710
Don't tell anybody.

04:27.743 --> 04:30.746
Oh, I won't, my lips
are sealed, hippo's honor.

04:30.779 --> 04:33.415
Mr. Pintop will announce
it when the time's right.

04:33.449 --> 04:36.819
Till then, they workin',
I'm scoutin'.

04:36.851 --> 04:37.985
Scouting?

04:38.019 --> 04:39.321
Scouting for what?

04:39.355 --> 04:40.522
I'm glad you asked, kid.

04:40.556 --> 04:42.725
I'm scouting for talent.

04:42.758 --> 04:43.925
Talent?

04:43.958 --> 04:47.696
Raw talent, the kind you
can't manufacture in a studio.

04:47.730 --> 04:48.930
Oh.

04:48.963 --> 04:50.599
You mean real singers.

04:50.632 --> 04:52.033
Exactly.

04:52.066 --> 04:53.502
Well, good luck,
there are lots

04:53.535 --> 04:55.304
of talented birds in Fernville.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.606
You oughta find Marshall,
and Mimi, they're the best.

04:57.639 --> 04:58.940
Hold on there, kid.

04:58.973 --> 05:03.379
Mr. Pintop's got his finger
on the pulse of pop culture,

05:03.412 --> 05:06.914
and he says hippos
are the next big thing.

05:06.948 --> 05:07.915
He does?

05:07.949 --> 05:09.752
Figuratively speaking.

05:09.785 --> 05:11.018
Oh my!

05:11.052 --> 05:13.054
Who are we to argue, right?

05:13.088 --> 05:15.324
His track record
speaks for itself.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.924
Yes, it sure does!

05:16.958 --> 05:18.193
And I'll tell you
one more thing.

05:18.227 --> 05:21.830
He's got his eye on this
upcoming singing competition.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.064
He does?!

05:23.098 --> 05:24.366
He does.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.602
Kid, how would you like to land

05:26.635 --> 05:30.439
an in-person audition with
Marlon Pintop?

05:30.472 --> 05:31.473
How would I?

05:31.507 --> 05:33.142
It would be a dream come true.

05:33.175 --> 05:36.010
But, oh, but I could never.

05:36.043 --> 05:36.978
Why not?

05:37.011 --> 05:39.181
I'm just a hippopotamus.

05:40.047 --> 05:41.216
True that.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.619
But look, get your
song down and come

05:43.652 --> 05:47.256
to Marlon Pintop's office at
6:00 sharp.

05:47.289 --> 05:49.491
He'll hear you out one-on-one.

05:49.525 --> 05:51.959
Let you know where you stand.

05:51.993 --> 05:54.696
Oh my, is this really
happening?

05:54.730 --> 05:57.299
If I had a banana for
every time I heard that,

05:57.332 --> 05:59.168
I'd be one big monkey.

06:00.269 --> 06:02.438
Should I sing a
particular style,

06:02.471 --> 06:04.406
or just whatever I'm best at?

06:04.440 --> 06:06.073
Sing what you feel, kid.

06:06.108 --> 06:09.344
If it doesn't come from
the heart, scrap it,

06:09.378 --> 06:11.814
'cause it ain't gonna
be good enough.

06:11.847 --> 06:15.384
Marlon doesn't just listen
to the notes and keys.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.985
He listens to your soul.

06:18.019 --> 06:18.986
Oh.

06:19.020 --> 06:20.789
It's true what they
say about him, you know.

06:20.823 --> 06:25.828
He's a genius, with a one in
a lifetime eye for talent.

06:26.195 --> 06:27.429
I don't doubt it.

06:27.463 --> 06:28.931
Oh dear.

06:28.963 --> 06:30.866
I'm getting nervous.

06:30.899 --> 06:33.469
Wrangle them
butterflies, Tiny.

06:33.502 --> 06:36.905
Rookies choke, but pros deliver.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.775
You wanna take the next
step in your career,

06:39.808 --> 06:42.977
it's time to rise to the
occasion.

06:43.010 --> 06:44.179
Yes!

06:44.213 --> 06:47.616
This is the first step in
the rest of your life, Tiny.

06:47.649 --> 06:51.620
We'll expect to see you at
the castle at six sharp.

06:51.653 --> 06:56.158
But if Timberwolf calls,
your audition is off, got it?

06:57.392 --> 06:58.894
Oh, okay.

06:58.927 --> 07:02.097
I'd reschedule anytime Marlon
could see me, it's no problem.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.665
Well you're not listening.

07:03.699 --> 07:06.201
I didn't say he'll
reschedule you.

07:06.235 --> 07:08.303
I said he'll cancel you.

07:08.337 --> 07:10.806
That'll be the end of your shot.

07:10.839 --> 07:13.675
Maybe you could clean up the
studio at the end of the day,

07:13.709 --> 07:15.143
but that's about it.

07:15.177 --> 07:16.512
Oh, I see.

07:16.545 --> 07:19.715
On Marlon Pintop's and
Justin Timberwolf's level,

07:19.748 --> 07:22.384
you can pretty much
call your own shots.

07:22.417 --> 07:24.152
That's show business, kid.

07:24.186 --> 07:26.188
But hey, look at
the bright side.

07:26.221 --> 07:28.790
A minute ago, you were
singing to the gnats.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.994
Now, you're rubbing
shanks with legends.

07:32.059 --> 07:33.362
See you at six.

07:33.395 --> 07:34.663
Oh, okay.

07:34.696 --> 07:36.431
What an amazing opportunity.

07:36.465 --> 07:37.666
Thank you, Ace.

07:37.699 --> 07:38.834
Six sharp.

07:38.867 --> 07:41.370
You're a second late,
you lose your shot.

07:41.403 --> 07:43.070
No second chances.

07:43.105 --> 07:44.006
Got it.

07:44.038 --> 07:45.841
Now, finish that
song of yours for me.

07:45.874 --> 07:47.676
I like what I was hearing.

07:47.709 --> 07:48.644

Your pitch, your key,
every note.

09:00.849 --> 09:02.284
Your voice is perfect.

09:02.317 --> 09:04.886
Oh Marshall,
thank you so much.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.657
But don't say those things,
you're making me self-conscious.

09:08.690 --> 09:10.759
I wouldn't say it if
it weren't true, Memes.

09:10.792 --> 09:13.462
I have a confession to make.

09:13.495 --> 09:14.630
A confession?

09:14.663 --> 09:15.664
What is it?

09:15.697 --> 09:18.266
I'd be just as happy
being eliminated by you

09:18.300 --> 09:20.035
as I would be by winning it all,

09:20.068 --> 09:22.304
and Mimi, I hope you win.

09:22.337 --> 09:25.207
Marshall, that's so
sweet of you.

09:25.240 --> 09:28.443
But I have to admit,
I hope that you win.

09:28.477 --> 09:31.680
Well, I guess both of our
chances of winning just doubled.

09:33.082 --> 09:34.216
Hey Dave.

09:34.249 --> 09:36.184
Hey guys, did you
hear the news?

09:36.218 --> 09:37.285
What news?

09:37.319 --> 09:39.921
Tiny got called up to
Marlon Pintop's office

09:39.955 --> 09:41.456
for a singing audition.

09:41.490 --> 09:42.290
Whoa.

09:42.324 --> 09:43.325
Really?

09:43.358 --> 09:45.427
I thought Marlon Pintop
was dead.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.395
Nope.

09:46.428 --> 09:47.863
Apparently he was
just on vacation.

09:47.896 --> 09:48.730
Oh wow.

09:49.931 --> 09:51.667
That's terrible news!

09:53.802 --> 09:55.303
Yeah, it's awful.

09:55.337 --> 09:58.740
I mean, not about Pintop
being alive, of course.

09:58.774 --> 09:59.641
Of course.

09:59.675 --> 10:01.110
You guys aren't happy for her?

10:01.144 --> 10:03.879
We would be,
if it were an audition

10:03.912 --> 10:06.415
for anybody but Marlon Pintop.

10:06.448 --> 10:08.583
Yeah, Pintop's a real snake.

10:08.617 --> 10:10.018
He's an anteater, actually.

10:10.052 --> 10:11.353
You know what I mean, Woody.

10:11.386 --> 10:14.022
The last thing a nice
hippo like Tiny needs

10:14.056 --> 10:15.891
is to get mixed up with that
creep Marlon,

10:15.924 --> 10:17.325
or any of his fame hounds.

10:17.359 --> 10:18.193
Right.

10:18.226 --> 10:21.164
Tiny's such a sweet hippo.

10:21.196 --> 10:25.500
Innocent and kind, and she's
aspired to sing forever.

10:25.534 --> 10:27.335
Pintop's done this kind of
thing before.

10:27.369 --> 10:29.971
He always tricks unsuspecting
animals into paying him

10:30.005 --> 10:32.340
to groom their careers, as if
they have careers to groom.

10:32.374 --> 10:35.010
We oughta warn Tiny not to
waste her time with that jerk.

10:35.043 --> 10:36.611
But Marshall, wait.

10:36.645 --> 10:38.580
Do you think the
truth will shatter

10:38.613 --> 10:40.282
Tiny's dreams of singing?

10:40.315 --> 10:42.484
I think what she'll be
subjected to in that office

10:42.517 --> 10:44.853
will demoralize her more
than anything we might say.

10:44.886 --> 10:45.721
You're right.

10:45.754 --> 10:47.856
Let's go find her now,
before she makes

10:47.889 --> 10:50.025
a mistake she can't take back.

10:50.058 --> 10:51.626
I wish I could take
back my mistake.

10:51.660 --> 10:52.561
Your mistake?

10:52.594 --> 10:54.362
What mistake did
you make, Woody?

10:54.396 --> 10:56.298
When I was young,
Marlon told me

10:56.331 --> 10:59.367
I had golden pipes, and
was destined for stardom.

10:59.401 --> 11:01.837
He told me I was gonna go far.

11:01.870 --> 11:05.108
Only I didn't know just how
far he was talkin' about.

11:05.141 --> 11:07.709
Oh no, what happened, Woody?

11:07.743 --> 11:09.945
Marlon booked me a singing gig

11:09.978 --> 11:12.581
aboard a Starlight
cruise line ship

11:12.614 --> 11:14.382
that set sail the next day.

11:14.416 --> 11:15.751
21 shows a week.

11:16.752 --> 11:17.619
Hmm.

11:17.652 --> 11:19.554
That actually sounds
like a lot of fun.

11:19.588 --> 11:20.856
What went wrong?

11:20.889 --> 11:21.957
The ship never docked.

11:21.990 --> 11:24.426
We circled the ocean
for months on end.

11:24.459 --> 11:26.962
We ran out of food,
and I ended up getting

11:26.995 --> 11:30.365
polyps on my vocal
cords, and lost my voice.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.367
But they still wouldn't
give me a break.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.704
I had to start every
show on time, every time.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.573
And take requests,
and do encores.

11:40.008 --> 11:42.078
It was like a nightmare.

11:42.111 --> 11:43.879
Woody, that's horrible!

11:43.912 --> 11:46.047
How did you manage
to get out of it?

11:46.082 --> 11:49.085
I bided my time, waited
till I caught sight of land,

11:49.118 --> 11:51.787
then jumped overboard
and swam for it.

11:51.820 --> 11:52.654
You what?

11:52.687 --> 11:54.223
That sounds dangerous.

11:54.257 --> 11:55.056
It was.

11:55.091 --> 11:57.492
It was like a five-mile
backstroke

11:57.526 --> 11:59.427
through shark-infested waters.

11:59.461 --> 12:02.697
Good thing I'm an otter,
slick and speedy,

12:02.731 --> 12:05.801
otherwise I'd have
been a goner for sure.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.236
Let's go talk to Tiny.

12:07.270 --> 12:09.004
Right, let's go.

12:09.037 --> 12:11.773
I'm so excited about
this audition, Ronda.

12:11.807 --> 12:13.875
It could be the start of
something big!

12:13.909 --> 12:17.512
The fulfillment of all my
dreams since I was a wee hippo.

12:17.546 --> 12:19.115
Be careful, Tiny.

12:19.148 --> 12:22.617
I mean, why is this scout
so interested in you

12:22.651 --> 12:25.353
if you've never even
sung in public before?

12:25.387 --> 12:27.322
Because he head
something in my voice,

12:27.355 --> 12:29.624
something that told
him I could be a star.

12:29.658 --> 12:32.161
They're trained to recognize
this kinda thing, you know?

12:32.195 --> 12:35.797
Yeah, I still think
it's strange.

12:35.831 --> 12:38.400
Marshall, Mimi, I have
great news to tell you!

12:38.433 --> 12:39.434
We know.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.569
We heard.

12:40.602 --> 12:41.403
You did?

12:41.436 --> 12:42.704
About Marlon Pintop?

12:42.737 --> 12:43.705
We did.

12:43.738 --> 12:44.639
But how?

12:44.673 --> 12:45.674
Woody told us.

12:45.707 --> 12:46.541
Woody?

12:46.575 --> 12:48.177
That eavesdropping river otter.

12:48.211 --> 12:50.812
I should've known, he's
always slinking around.

12:50.846 --> 12:53.348
Oh well, isn't it great?

12:54.683 --> 12:56.751
We don't think
you should go, Tiny.

12:56.785 --> 12:57.652
What?

12:57.686 --> 12:59.322
But why?

12:59.354 --> 13:01.224
Marlon Pintop's no good.

13:01.257 --> 13:03.058
Everybody in Fernville
knows that.

13:03.092 --> 13:06.229
He tells lies, plays games,
and takes advantage of animals.

13:06.262 --> 13:09.531
And what he did to poor
Woody was unforgivable!

13:09.564 --> 13:11.167
You mean the
cruise ship story?

13:11.200 --> 13:13.368
It changes a little
every time he tells it.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.370
It started off being
a two day cruise

13:15.403 --> 13:17.072
that ran an hour
later than planned.

13:17.106 --> 13:18.773
Then it turned
into a fuel problem,

13:18.807 --> 13:20.542
then it turned into
a capsizing boat,

13:20.575 --> 13:22.744
then a 10-yard swim to shore,

13:22.777 --> 13:24.446
then a two-mile swim to shore,

13:24.479 --> 13:25.947
then a swim through
piranha-infested waters,

13:25.981 --> 13:27.415
then through
jellyfish-infested waters,

13:27.449 --> 13:28.817
then shark-infested waters.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.051
That's the version we heard.

13:30.086 --> 13:32.321
Five miles with sharks.

13:32.355 --> 13:34.890
Ha, well my Aunt Bertha
was on that cruise,

13:34.923 --> 13:37.093
and she told me what
really happened.

13:37.126 --> 13:39.728
She said Woody got distracted
by a school of fish

13:39.761 --> 13:42.063
and dove overboard during
his opening number,

13:42.098 --> 13:44.900
ruining the night's
entertainment for all the guests.

13:44.933 --> 13:48.003
They threw lifesavers
and circled back for him,

13:48.036 --> 13:49.871
but he wouldn't
stop chasing fish.

13:49.905 --> 13:52.275
He swam around and
around like a lunatic

13:52.308 --> 13:54.442
until he exhausted
himself and had to be

13:54.476 --> 13:57.412
hauled back onboard
like a wet rag.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.513
Wow.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.316
That sounds
more feasible, actually.

14:00.349 --> 14:02.984
And Marlon Pintop had
nothing to do with that cruise,

14:03.018 --> 14:04.853
other than holding a standing
reservation

14:04.886 --> 14:07.822
that he never filled because
he said Starlight cruise lines

14:07.856 --> 14:10.525
weren't classy enough for
him and his entourage.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.760
I can believe that.

14:11.793 --> 14:14.829
Although Woody's version of
events sure sounded feasible.

14:14.863 --> 14:18.767
Either way, Marlon Pintop
has done lots of animals wrong,

14:18.800 --> 14:21.304
and crushed countless
dreams in the name

14:21.337 --> 14:22.737
of fame and fortune.

14:22.771 --> 14:26.175
Right, you should think
long and hard about it, Tiny,

14:26.208 --> 14:27.575
before you decide.

14:27.609 --> 14:29.044
Thank you for
your concern, guys.

14:29.078 --> 14:30.779
It's nice to have friends
like you who care,

14:30.812 --> 14:32.814
but I can take care
of myself, honest.

14:32.847 --> 14:35.384
Why don't you
let me go with you, Tiny?

14:36.319 --> 14:37.485
Mimi, no!

14:37.519 --> 14:39.754
I do appreciate the offer,
Mimi, but you're a songbird,

14:39.788 --> 14:43.125
I can't take you to
my private audition.

14:43.159 --> 14:45.328
If Marlon heard you sing,
he'd send me packing

14:45.361 --> 14:46.962
as soon as you opened your beak.

14:46.995 --> 14:48.164
She's got a point, Memes.

14:48.197 --> 14:50.399
We must ensure Tiny's safety.

14:50.433 --> 14:52.667
I know, I'll take
Ronda with me.

14:52.701 --> 14:54.403
That's a great idea.

14:54.437 --> 14:55.338
Yeah.

14:55.371 --> 14:56.805
All right, if nothing
comes of it,

14:56.838 --> 14:58.773
at the very least we'll
have a story to tell

14:58.807 --> 15:00.309
about that time we went to an
audition

15:00.343 --> 15:03.245
for famous superstar
producer Marlon Pintop.

15:03.279 --> 15:06.248
Or about that time
you went to audition

15:06.282 --> 15:09.751
for famous superstar
producer Marlon Pintop,

15:09.784 --> 15:11.886
and I just played third wheel.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.189
Insignificant details.

15:13.222 --> 15:16.092
What do you say,
Ronda, girl's day out?

15:16.125 --> 15:17.492
Oh, okay.

15:17.525 --> 15:18.361
Yay!

15:19.894 --> 15:22.030
But if anyone
invites me to sing,

15:22.063 --> 15:25.834
I'm gonna belt it
out loud and proud.

15:25.867 --> 15:27.769
I'd expect nothin'
less, sister.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.671
Come on, we have a trip to plan.

15:29.704 --> 15:31.973
Don't forget,
Mimi and I will be here

15:32.007 --> 15:33.242
in case you need us.

15:33.275 --> 15:35.710
♪ All you have to
do is reach out and ♪

15:35.744 --> 15:37.279
Call your pals.

15:37.313 --> 15:40.483
♪ We'll be here if you need ♪

15:40.515 --> 15:42.017
We'll be here if you need.

15:42.050 --> 15:44.753
I'm tellin' you,
Marlon, this hippo kid's

15:44.786 --> 15:47.522
got a voice like claws on a
chalkboard.

15:47.555 --> 15:51.360
But in a totally messed
up way, she's got style.

15:51.394 --> 15:54.929
With a little nudge this
way, and big shove that way,

15:54.963 --> 15:57.866
you might could turn her into
something.

15:57.899 --> 16:00.202
I'm a very busy anteater, Ace.

16:00.236 --> 16:01.203
You know this.

16:01.237 --> 16:04.240
But I'll humor
your find, this time.

16:04.273 --> 16:06.208
Thanks Marlon, you won't
regret it.

16:06.242 --> 16:08.210
Well, at least I think so,
anyway.

16:08.244 --> 16:09.911
We'll see about that.

16:09.944 --> 16:12.747
Either way, it's no
skin off my snout.

16:12.781 --> 16:15.451
I have a brand new
protege who's gearing up

16:15.484 --> 16:17.486
to take the world by storm.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.320
You do?

16:18.354 --> 16:20.322
Mind if I ask who it is, boss?

16:20.356 --> 16:21.723
Not at all.

16:21.756 --> 16:24.293
Everyone will find out
soon enough, anyway.

16:24.326 --> 16:28.897
I'm telling you Ace, this
kid's got billion-dollar pipes.

16:28.930 --> 16:33.902
He sings, he croons, he screams,
he raps, he does it all.

16:34.403 --> 16:37.206
His take on the oldies is
effortless.

16:37.239 --> 16:38.973
His pop is poppin'.

16:39.007 --> 16:41.210
His freestyle's clean.

16:41.243 --> 16:44.480
This kid's a once in
a lifetime find.

16:44.513 --> 16:48.016
He's got star written
all over him.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.984
Hopefully he didn't write
it in permanent marker.

16:50.018 --> 16:53.021
I didn't mean it was
literally written on him,

16:53.054 --> 16:55.558
I meant the kid oozes charisma.

16:55.590 --> 16:57.659
He sweats raw talent.

16:57.692 --> 17:01.163
The mic and the
camera both love him.

17:01.197 --> 17:03.731
Wow, he sounds like
something else, boss.

17:03.765 --> 17:05.101
What's his name?

17:05.134 --> 17:06.569
His name's Brad.

17:06.601 --> 17:07.503
Brad?

17:07.536 --> 17:08.770
That's it?

17:08.803 --> 17:10.339
Just Brad?

17:10.372 --> 17:12.274
Of course that's not it.

17:12.308 --> 17:15.344
He may have been
born Brad, but now that

17:15.377 --> 17:18.280
I've got ahold of him, he'll be
known as

17:18.314 --> 17:20.782
Lil Wings Fresh Quills.

17:20.815 --> 17:23.017
Lil Wings Fresh Quills.

17:23.051 --> 17:25.421
I love it, something memorable.

17:25.454 --> 17:29.425
Artistic chic, combined
with instant street cred.

17:29.458 --> 17:31.260
Marlon, you're a genius.

17:31.293 --> 17:33.095
Of course I am.

17:33.129 --> 17:35.464
You just wait and see, Ace.

17:35.498 --> 17:38.601
On the strength of
Lil Wings's lil wings,

17:38.633 --> 17:41.836
I'm headed straight back
to the top of the charts.

17:41.870 --> 17:42.704
Nice.

17:43.838 --> 17:47.143
Now, let's have some fun
with this hippo of yours.

17:47.176 --> 17:48.577
Absolutely.

17:48.611 --> 17:50.146
It's almost six.

17:50.179 --> 17:51.813
She should be here any minute.

17:51.846 --> 17:54.682
I made a point to tell her
not to be a second late.

17:54.716 --> 17:58.254
Ha, I really love it
when they sweat the clock,

17:58.287 --> 18:01.823
it really brings out the
desperation in their eyes.

18:01.856 --> 18:03.192
I know, right?

18:07.729 --> 18:08.663
How much longer?

18:08.696 --> 18:09.931
A little on foot?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.133
A little while longer.

18:11.167 --> 18:13.001
It's all the way
in the city, Ronda.

18:13.034 --> 18:14.669
Nervous, huh?

18:14.702 --> 18:15.604
Nervous?

18:15.638 --> 18:16.539
Nah.

18:16.572 --> 18:17.972
I'm scared to death.

18:18.006 --> 18:19.841
There's nothing
to be scared of.

18:19.874 --> 18:22.645
We'll just go in, you'll
give it your best shot,

18:22.677 --> 18:26.248
have fun, and let the
bananas fall where they may.

18:26.282 --> 18:27.416
But what if things go wrong?

18:27.449 --> 18:29.017
What if Marlon doesn't like me?

18:29.050 --> 18:30.386
What if I forget my verses?

18:30.419 --> 18:31.453
What if I choke?

18:31.487 --> 18:34.055
Tiny, all you ever have to do

18:34.089 --> 18:37.025
is follow your instincts
and listen to your heart.

18:37.058 --> 18:38.026
You think so?

18:38.059 --> 18:39.662
I know so.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.097
Ah, you're right, let's go.

18:44.933 --> 18:47.469
You think Tiny and Ronda
made it to Pintop by now?

18:47.503 --> 18:49.405
If not, they should arrive any
time.

18:49.438 --> 18:52.408
I hope this thing's legit
and Tiny has a good time.

18:52.441 --> 18:53.475
Me too.

18:53.509 --> 18:56.312
I just want to see them
both get back home safe,

18:56.345 --> 18:58.547
and not too disappointed.

18:58.581 --> 19:00.048
'Sup, players?

19:00.082 --> 19:02.817
Lil Wings up in here,
how you all keepin' it?

19:02.850 --> 19:04.186
Excuse me?

19:04.220 --> 19:06.854
Lotta folks got that reaction
to Lil,

19:06.888 --> 19:07.989
know what I'm saying?

19:08.022 --> 19:09.658
That's a'ight, here.

19:09.692 --> 19:11.227
I'll lay down a little
sumin'-sumin',

19:11.260 --> 19:13.095

19:31.380 --> 19:32.648
For an eagle.

19:32.681 --> 19:35.016
My second track talks all
about that.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.185
Here's a sample.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.587

chickens go cluck cluck,

21:06.508 --> 21:08.177
and you don't know us.

21:08.210 --> 21:10.546
We were singing in the bird
choir when you were still

21:10.579 --> 21:12.847
picking your name off of a
Scrabble board.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.383
Ooh, I like that.

I just seen y'all hanging out

21:39.308 --> 21:41.210

21:41.243 --> 21:43.911
I mean, I ain't tryin' out so
much

21:43.945 --> 21:45.647
as sampling some of my new
material,

21:45.681 --> 21:48.083
so it's more an exclusive
private show

21:48.117 --> 21:50.352
for those in attendance, really.

21:50.386 --> 21:52.287
Well, thanks for
thinking of us, Mr. Quills,

21:52.321 --> 21:54.356
but we'll see you on stage.

22:13.442 --> 22:15.677
- Wow.
- There are no words.

22:16.612 --> 22:18.514
Well, well, well.

22:18.547 --> 22:20.682
Look who the cat dragged in.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.184
Good luck, Tiny.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.420
You have to say "break a leg,"

22:24.453 --> 22:26.321
good luck's bad luck in show
business.

22:26.355 --> 22:27.589
Okay!

22:27.623 --> 22:28.824
Break a leg!

22:28.857 --> 22:30.426
Break all your legs!

22:30.459 --> 22:31.527
Just one will do.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.561
Right.

22:32.594 --> 22:36.799
So, in one place or
like, multiple fractures?

22:36.832 --> 22:38.801
Just the break, no more detail
required.

22:38.834 --> 22:39.735
Oh, okay.

22:40.803 --> 22:44.640
Tick, tock, tock, like
sand through the hourglass

22:44.673 --> 22:47.176
of your hopes and dreams, kid.

22:47.209 --> 22:48.877
You're late.

22:48.911 --> 22:50.345
Oh, sorry, Mr. Pintop, but you
see,

22:50.379 --> 22:51.847
we come from the jungle.

22:51.880 --> 22:52.748
We?

22:52.781 --> 22:54.015
Who's the ape?

22:54.048 --> 22:56.251
That's my friend Ronda.

22:56.285 --> 22:57.319
Ronda?

22:57.352 --> 23:01.055
Say, anybody ever tell ya
you look like King Kong?

23:01.089 --> 23:03.292
You should try for the movies.

23:03.325 --> 23:04.426
Ah, thanks?

23:05.861 --> 23:08.163
Now hippo, are you ready to
seize

23:08.197 --> 23:10.332
your dreams by the horns?

23:10.365 --> 23:13.101
Are you ready to take
control of your destiny?

23:13.135 --> 23:16.705
Are you ready to turn
fantasy into reality?

23:16.738 --> 23:17.773
Yes.

23:17.806 --> 23:18.807
What?

23:18.841 --> 23:19.808
I can't hear you.

23:19.842 --> 23:20.642
Yes.

23:20.676 --> 23:21.510
What?!

23:21.543 --> 23:22.344
Yes!

23:22.377 --> 23:23.612
Very well, then.

23:23.645 --> 23:26.949
Wasting your time wastes my
time, Tiny,

23:26.981 --> 23:30.519
and Marlon Pintop detests
wasting time.

23:30.552 --> 23:31.920
Do you understand?

23:31.954 --> 23:32.788
Yes!

23:32.821 --> 23:34.523
Are you ready to sing for me?

23:34.556 --> 23:35.691
Yes!

23:35.724 --> 23:37.326
Do you have a song prepared?

23:37.359 --> 23:38.460
Yes.

23:38.494 --> 23:40.529
Then let's hear it.

23:40.562 --> 23:41.563
Right now?

23:48.770 --> 23:51.340
Can you believe that
Lil Wings character?

23:51.373 --> 23:52.474
What a clown!

23:53.342 --> 23:54.610
Little Wings Fresh Quills?

23:54.643 --> 23:57.913
As goofy as he was, we'll
probably remember him forever.

23:57.946 --> 23:59.248
How can we forget?

23:59.281 --> 24:01.717
He was totally ridiculous.

24:01.750 --> 24:04.152
Tiny, Ronda, you're back.

24:04.186 --> 24:05.087
How did it go?

24:05.120 --> 24:06.154
Terrible.

24:06.188 --> 24:08.524
Marlon only called me out
there to make fun of me.

24:08.557 --> 24:10.292
It was totally humiliating!

24:10.325 --> 24:13.795
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear
that, Tiny.

24:13.829 --> 24:15.497
How terrible!

24:15.531 --> 24:17.266
You both warned me, it's
nothing

24:17.299 --> 24:18.634
I shouldn't have seen coming.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.602
I should've listened to
you guys in the first place

24:20.636 --> 24:22.671
and spared myself the
embarrassment.

24:22.704 --> 24:25.841
Oh, Tiny, it's nothing you
should've dealt with at all.

24:25.874 --> 24:26.675
You're better than that.

24:26.708 --> 24:27.776
I can see that now.

24:27.809 --> 24:30.546
Success sure isn't all
that it's cracked up to be.

24:30.579 --> 24:32.046
On the contrary, Tiny.

24:32.080 --> 24:35.150
There's nothing wrong with
success or accomplishments.

24:35.183 --> 24:37.753
It's other people's
perception of your success

24:37.786 --> 24:39.021
that's the problem.

24:39.053 --> 24:40.622
Well, I've learned my lesson.

24:40.656 --> 24:42.324
I don't wanna be a singer
anymore.

24:42.357 --> 24:44.560
If being in show business means
dealing

24:44.593 --> 24:46.995
with monsters like
Marlon, it's not worth it.

24:47.029 --> 24:50.499
I'll let talented performers
like you birds do the singing,

24:50.532 --> 24:52.100
and I'll cheer you on.

24:52.134 --> 24:53.302
That sounds nice, Tiny.

24:53.335 --> 24:55.771
And look at it this way,
at least you realize

24:55.804 --> 24:57.239
what's really important in life,

24:57.272 --> 24:58.807
and you didn't have to waste any
time

24:58.840 --> 25:00.809
wallowing in the wrong ponds to
do it.

25:00.842 --> 25:03.545
Performing is fun, but friends
and family are forever.

25:03.579 --> 25:04.646
That's right.

25:04.680 --> 25:07.449
Imagine this, that creep told me

25:07.482 --> 25:09.551
I reminded him of King Kong.

25:09.585 --> 25:11.119
Can you believe it?

25:11.153 --> 25:12.387
Hmm.

25:12.421 --> 25:13.388
Well.

25:13.422 --> 25:15.424
Hey gang, are y'all
headed to the singing

25:15.457 --> 25:17.092
competition tryouts?

25:17.125 --> 25:18.327
Oh, when are they?

25:18.360 --> 25:19.695
Right now!

25:19.728 --> 25:22.898
On stage in Fernville town
square.

25:22.931 --> 25:23.932
Whoa.

25:23.966 --> 25:26.234
With all these distractions, we
almost

25:26.268 --> 25:28.003
just missed the tryouts.

25:28.036 --> 25:30.973
Are you guys still gonna
get up and strut your stuff?

25:31.006 --> 25:32.040
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

25:32.074 --> 25:35.410
After Tiny's bad
experience, I'm not so sure.

25:35.444 --> 25:37.212
Oh, you should, both of you.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.715
You birds are such great
singers!

25:39.748 --> 25:42.017
Don't let my story
about some two-bit bully

25:42.050 --> 25:44.186
keep you from singing
the song in your hearts.

25:44.219 --> 25:46.321
That's right, sing it loud.

25:46.355 --> 25:48.824
Okay, okay, I'm convinced.

25:48.857 --> 25:50.192
Let's go, Memes.

25:50.225 --> 25:51.693
Okay, I'm in.

25:51.727 --> 25:54.296
Great, there's still time to
enter!

25:54.329 --> 25:56.198
All right, everybody.

25:56.231 --> 25:59.868
Welcome to the singing
competition open mic tryouts.

25:59.901 --> 26:01.503
Come one, come all.

26:01.536 --> 26:04.640
Show what you got, and
see where you stand.

26:04.673 --> 26:06.742
If this year's like our past
years,

26:06.775 --> 26:09.478
we're looking forward to
an entertaining afternoon

26:09.511 --> 26:12.481
of talented songsmiths and crazy
crooners!

26:12.514 --> 26:15.984
Now, like I said, this stage is
open.

26:16.018 --> 26:18.420
Don't let the spotlight deter
you.

26:18.453 --> 26:22.024
If you have a song on your lips,
come up and let us hear it.

26:22.057 --> 26:23.859
You never know what could
happen.

26:23.892 --> 26:27.529
You might even be the
next Clambake Shelton!

26:28.463 --> 26:29.798
Or Gwen Starfishy.

26:29.831 --> 26:32.701
Woohoo, I'm raring to go!

26:32.734 --> 26:34.036
Let's do this.

26:34.069 --> 26:37.472
I know you just had a
terrible time with Pintop, Tiny,

26:37.506 --> 26:40.842
but why don't ya get up
there and sing for everyone?

26:40.876 --> 26:44.147
You'll feel better, and
whether you advance or not,

26:44.179 --> 26:46.815
you'll do it on your own terms.

26:46.848 --> 26:48.684
I think that's a great idea.

26:48.717 --> 26:49.885
I don't know.

26:49.918 --> 26:52.654
I've been thinking maybe
songwriting is for me.

26:52.688 --> 26:54.756
Freeforming is so much pressure.

26:54.790 --> 26:55.924
Who needs it?

26:55.957 --> 26:58.026
Listen, what is that?

27:00.896 --> 27:02.197
Emmet, is that you?

27:02.230 --> 27:03.699
Are you nervous, buddy?

27:03.732 --> 27:07.402
I've always wanted
to sing, but I've never

27:08.870 --> 27:10.605
been on stage before.

27:11.506 --> 27:12.774
It's so bright.

27:14.242 --> 27:16.912
I didn't know it'd be so bright!

27:18.280 --> 27:20.282
It's okay, just sing to us.

27:20.315 --> 27:21.383
We're your friends.

27:21.416 --> 27:25.088
Yeah, focus on us and
block out everything else.

27:25.121 --> 27:27.389
What if I get heckled?

27:27.422 --> 27:30.258
What if they start throwing
stuff?

27:32.594 --> 27:34.796
It's not that kinda
crowd, Emmet, trust me.

27:34.830 --> 27:36.398
Okay, here we go.

27:36.431 --> 27:38.700
This young eagle insists on
being

27:38.734 --> 27:41.236
the afternoon's first
singer, and he wanted me

27:41.269 --> 27:43.505
to tell you all that he's
normally much,

27:43.538 --> 27:46.475
and I stress much, harder edged

27:46.508 --> 27:48.310
than he'll show us here today.

27:48.343 --> 27:51.913
Please give a warm Fernville
welcome to

27:51.947 --> 27:54.117
Little Wings Fresh Quilts.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.754
On second thought,
Emmet, maybe wait a minute

27:58.787 --> 27:59.988
and see how things go.

28:00.021 --> 28:02.023
Yeah, hang tight, buddy.

28:13.702 --> 28:15.904
Yo, what'd you call me?

28:15.937 --> 28:18.241
Little Wings Fresh Quilts?

28:18.273 --> 28:20.176
It's Lil, dog.

28:20.209 --> 28:21.409
Lil.

28:21.443 --> 28:24.412
Lil Wings Fresh Quills, ya heard
me?

28:24.446 --> 28:25.781
Fresh Quills.

28:25.814 --> 28:27.482
Oh, I apologize.

28:27.516 --> 28:30.819
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your paws, hooves,

28:30.852 --> 28:34.689
and wings together for
Lil Wings Fresh Quills!

28:43.132 --> 28:45.234
Yeah, one, two, one, two.

28:45.268 --> 28:47.236
Wait till you guys
get a load of this.

28:47.270 --> 28:48.937
Who's this joker?

28:48.970 --> 28:50.173
Oh, you'll see.

28:50.206 --> 28:52.741

We warned you.

29:40.488 --> 29:42.390
It's okay if you need
a minute to regroup.

29:42.424 --> 29:43.525
Oh man.

29:43.558 --> 29:46.595
I don't know if that
was good or bad or what.

29:46.628 --> 29:49.165
All I know is I can't follow it.

29:49.198 --> 29:51.600
I need to reevaluate my life.

29:51.633 --> 29:53.202
I'm going home, guys.

29:53.236 --> 29:54.369
What?

29:54.402 --> 29:55.437
Come on, Em.

29:55.470 --> 29:57.139
You've been looking
forward to this competition

29:57.173 --> 29:58.773
ever since it was announced.

29:58.807 --> 30:00.508
That's right, I've been
listening

30:00.542 --> 30:02.677
to you practice for weeks!

30:02.711 --> 30:04.546
And I've lost countless hours
of sleep

30:04.579 --> 30:06.448
listening to you practice.

30:06.481 --> 30:07.549
We all have.

30:07.582 --> 30:09.185
You guys don't use earplugs?

30:09.218 --> 30:10.552
No, do they help?

30:10.585 --> 30:12.721
I sleep like a baby bird.

30:12.754 --> 30:13.889
Don't hear a thing.

30:13.922 --> 30:15.924
Oh, that makes me feel better.

30:15.957 --> 30:17.392
Don't take it personally,
Emmet.

30:17.425 --> 30:20.996
Some of us just need peace and
quiet to fall sound asleep.

30:21.029 --> 30:23.132
Not warbling and screeching.

30:23.165 --> 30:24.233
Come on, little buddy.

30:24.267 --> 30:25.767
Get up there and do a song.

30:25.800 --> 30:29.070
I was gonna until I saw that
last guy.

30:29.105 --> 30:30.739
What's his name again?

30:30.772 --> 30:33.708
Phil Sings and Washes Quilts?

30:33.742 --> 30:35.443
Lil Wings Fresh Quills.

30:35.477 --> 30:37.313
Yeah, that.

30:37.346 --> 30:39.981
I just can't compete with that,
guys.

30:40.015 --> 30:43.386
I was thinkin' it'd be a
fun afternoon singin' songs

30:43.418 --> 30:46.021
with my best friends, not that.

30:47.589 --> 30:51.826
It's all too, I don't know,
careerist for my taste.

30:52.727 --> 30:53.728
Okay, Em.

30:53.762 --> 30:54.696
If you're sure.

30:54.729 --> 30:55.797
I'm sure.

30:55.830 --> 30:58.833
I just wanna sit on my
rock and listen to the wind

30:58.867 --> 31:00.702
whistle through the trees.

31:00.735 --> 31:03.272
That's music to my ears.

31:03.306 --> 31:04.940
You don't have ears, Emmet.

31:04.973 --> 31:06.275
I have ear holes.

31:06.309 --> 31:08.344
I can hear just fine.

31:08.377 --> 31:09.611
We understand, Emmet.

31:09.644 --> 31:13.249
We'll see you later
after tryouts are over.

31:15.717 --> 31:17.286
Okay, later guys!

31:18.553 --> 31:20.055
Too bad Lil Wings went first.

31:20.089 --> 31:22.224
His performance broke Emmet
mentally.

31:22.258 --> 31:23.725
Yeah, it's too bad.

31:23.758 --> 31:26.027
If we could've taken the first
slots,

31:26.061 --> 31:28.630
I bet he'd have had a great
time.

31:28.663 --> 31:29.698
Show business.

31:29.731 --> 31:31.599
It's for the birds.

31:31.633 --> 31:32.634
Okay.

31:32.667 --> 31:35.137
That was Lil Wings Fresh Quills.

31:35.171 --> 31:37.173
And next up is, anybody?

31:39.641 --> 31:40.909
Anybody at all?

31:42.211 --> 31:45.013
Sing any song you like,
any way you like it.

31:45.046 --> 31:47.549
Any style, any tempo, any genre.

31:47.582 --> 31:48.817
Any at all.

31:48.850 --> 31:50.453
Solo, duet, or group.

31:50.485 --> 31:53.255
Everyone and anyone is welcome.

31:53.289 --> 31:55.757
Don't get cold paws,
hooves, fins, or wings,

31:55.790 --> 31:58.094
just let the music move you.

31:58.127 --> 32:00.396
Now once again, who's next?

32:01.997 --> 32:02.797
Shall we?

32:02.831 --> 32:03.631
Let's.

32:03.665 --> 32:05.033
Go get 'em.

32:05.066 --> 32:06.235
Knock 'em dead.

32:06.268 --> 32:09.838
Okay, we've all been waiting
for these two to show up.

32:09.871 --> 32:13.342
What's a singing competition
without the songbirds, right?

32:13.376 --> 32:14.642
Am I right?

32:16.345 --> 32:18.680
Say hello to Marshall and Mimi.

32:18.713 --> 32:20.515
Take it away, birdies.

32:29.657 --> 32:31.526
Well lookie here.

32:31.559 --> 32:34.929
Them two don't stand a bird's
chance on a helicopter pad,

32:34.963 --> 32:36.399
know what I'm sayin'?

32:36.432 --> 32:39.534
Bah, that's offensive, those

34:23.105 --> 34:25.840
That sounded like bird
droppings, know what I'm saying?

34:25.874 --> 34:29.578
Ain't no way they sound better
than Lil Wings, you heard?

34:29.612 --> 34:31.746
I'm gonna win it all, mark my
words.

34:31.779 --> 34:32.680
Win it all.

That was so much fun!

34:43.725 --> 34:44.826
How'd we sound?

34:44.859 --> 34:45.760
Great.

34:45.793 --> 34:47.463
Super duper!

34:47.496 --> 34:48.830
Awesome.

34:48.863 --> 34:50.099
Hey Lil Wings!

34:50.132 --> 34:51.766
Pfft.

34:51.799 --> 34:54.170
Oh, somebody's not happy.

34:54.203 --> 34:56.938
That jerk had the audacity to
come up

34:56.971 --> 34:58.641
and badmouth you guys.

34:58.673 --> 35:01.377
Yeah, to your best friends, no
less.

35:01.410 --> 35:02.977
We set him straight.

35:03.011 --> 35:03.912
That's right.

35:03.945 --> 35:05.181
Well, you know what they say.

35:05.214 --> 35:09.418
The loudest bird in the forest
is usually the most insecure.

35:09.451 --> 35:11.453
Wow, I mean, just wow.

35:12.687 --> 35:16.358
Marshall and Mimi, you birds
have outdone yourselves.

35:16.392 --> 35:18.960
We'll be listening again
in the championship round,

35:18.993 --> 35:19.994
I'm sure.

35:20.028 --> 35:21.363

monkeys, I see hippos,

capuchins, I see macaques,

35:38.581 --> 35:40.316
I even see river trout.

35:40.349 --> 35:42.884

37:31.593 --> 37:33.529
Thanks for twisting my ear,
Ronda,

37:33.562 --> 37:35.331
I don't think I would've
done it without you.

37:35.364 --> 37:38.933
Don't mention it, that's
what friends are for.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.736
Well, I want to take this
opportunity

37:40.769 --> 37:42.304
to thank all you guys.

37:42.338 --> 37:44.139
You're all so important to me.

37:44.173 --> 37:46.742
Today's really made me
see that even though

37:46.775 --> 37:48.910
we might have had bad days,
misfortunes,

37:48.943 --> 37:51.113
or setbacks once in a while,
it's never

37:51.146 --> 37:53.449
the end of the world, and the
only one

37:53.482 --> 37:55.084
who can beat us is us.

37:55.117 --> 37:57.186
Shout it out loud, sister!

37:57.219 --> 37:59.722
If I wasn't surrounded by
good friends who care about me,

37:59.755 --> 38:01.889
that visit to Pintop's
office probably would've

38:01.923 --> 38:03.525
put me off singing forever.

38:03.559 --> 38:05.427
It was so horrible.

38:05.461 --> 38:06.695
Poor Tiny.

38:06.729 --> 38:09.631
But now I see that it was just
a thing,

38:09.665 --> 38:10.998
and not my thing at all.

38:11.032 --> 38:12.701
If other folks want to live that
way

38:12.735 --> 38:14.603
and spend their time around
those kinds of folks,

38:14.636 --> 38:15.771
they can have it.

38:15.804 --> 38:17.905
I'm gonna sing whenever I feel
like it.

38:17.939 --> 38:20.743
For my friends, for my
loved ones, for anyone

38:20.776 --> 38:22.845
who's moved and motivated by
music.

38:22.877 --> 38:24.912
That's the Tiny we all know
and love.

38:24.946 --> 38:27.014
Yeah, welcome back, girl.

38:27.048 --> 38:29.884
I knew your fire
hadn't been extinguished.

38:29.917 --> 38:32.221
You're right, it's
burning brighter than ever,

38:32.254 --> 38:34.123
and I can't wait for
the competition finals.

38:34.156 --> 38:36.125
It's gonna be so fun.

38:36.158 --> 38:38.093
Marlon, you said I was a
shoe-in.

38:38.127 --> 38:40.962
You said Lil Wings was
taking the world by storm.

38:40.995 --> 38:43.799
But them stupid birds
got the better of me,

38:43.832 --> 38:45.401
in front of everybody.

38:45.434 --> 38:47.603
Calm down, Q, calm down.

38:48.537 --> 38:50.639
Stardom ebbs and flows.

38:50.672 --> 38:53.908
You've got to know how to ride
your wave.

38:53.941 --> 38:54.909
Huh?

38:54.942 --> 38:56.412
What wave?

38:56.445 --> 38:59.348
You mean a typhoon's
fixin' to hit our jungle?

39:01.015 --> 39:03.485
It means there's levels to
this.

39:03.519 --> 39:04.353
Oh.

39:04.386 --> 39:07.156
Well, I done got showed up,
bird.

39:07.189 --> 39:09.625
Ain't used to hearing
boos, know what I'm saying?

39:09.658 --> 39:11.560
I mean, there was cheering too,

39:11.593 --> 39:13.128
but I heard them boos, y'all.

39:13.162 --> 39:14.630
Jealousy.

39:14.663 --> 39:15.963
That's right, Q.

39:15.997 --> 39:19.401
It's important to realize,
no matter how hot you are,

39:19.435 --> 39:23.338
or how hard you crush it,
there will be folks out there

39:23.372 --> 39:27.543
whose only vested interest
is in seeing you fail.

39:27.576 --> 39:28.744
Suckers.

39:28.777 --> 39:30.279
Straight suckers.

39:30.312 --> 39:31.946
Tune them out, Q.

39:31.979 --> 39:35.350
Relegate them to the
background where they belong.

39:35.384 --> 39:37.286
It's just white noise.

39:37.319 --> 39:39.154
What if that noise
catches on, though,

39:39.188 --> 39:42.224
like what if they start
booing me whenever I turn up,

39:42.257 --> 39:45.828
like it becomes a
thing to boo Lil Wings?

39:45.861 --> 39:47.663
Then we turn it against them.

39:47.696 --> 39:50.899
The pop culture game
isn't hard to play, Q.

39:50.933 --> 39:52.401
What you mean, Marlon?

39:52.434 --> 39:54.269
If they start booing
you at events,

39:54.303 --> 39:55.904
we'll cut a new single.

39:55.938 --> 39:59.174
Boo the Q, catchy as all
get-out,

39:59.208 --> 40:02.277
with a hook that sticks
in their ears for days,

40:02.311 --> 40:03.846
like a bee sting.

40:03.879 --> 40:07.316
We'll reinvent those
boos, turning them into

40:07.349 --> 40:09.016
the way they cheer for you.

40:09.050 --> 40:11.520
Then it won't matter if the
whole planet

40:11.553 --> 40:13.422
boos you from every mountaintop.

40:13.455 --> 40:17.960
It'll only mean they're
getting down to the new Q.

40:17.992 --> 40:19.862
Can you dig it?

40:19.895 --> 40:21.028
Yeah.

40:21.062 --> 40:21.964
I can dig that.

40:21.996 --> 40:23.365
Ha.

40:23.398 --> 40:24.800
Mind-blowing, Marlon.

40:24.833 --> 40:25.701
You're such a genius.

40:25.734 --> 40:27.336
My eyes are twitching.

40:27.369 --> 40:28.971
Take a baby aspirin.

40:29.003 --> 40:30.037
Okay.

40:30.071 --> 40:32.608
The sooner you wrap
your head around the idea

40:32.641 --> 40:36.411
that you're a star, Q,
you'll be unstoppable.

40:36.445 --> 40:40.415
Remember, stars aren't made,
they're born.

40:40.449 --> 40:42.117
I see what you did there.

40:42.150 --> 40:43.452
Shut up, Ace.

40:43.485 --> 40:44.419
Yep.

40:44.453 --> 40:46.922
First stop, we win
that singing competition

40:46.955 --> 40:50.459
and show Fernville what
real talent sounds like.

40:50.492 --> 40:54.028
Next stop, we drop your
new album on the world

40:54.061 --> 40:56.131
and start climbing the charts.

40:56.164 --> 40:59.368
By my top 200 mathematical
calculations,

40:59.401 --> 41:03.672
your first single will hit
number one on week three.

41:03.705 --> 41:05.007
Week three?

41:05.039 --> 41:06.208
Nah.

41:06.241 --> 41:07.476
Why we gotta wait?

41:07.509 --> 41:09.177
It should hit right away.

41:09.211 --> 41:10.913
Boom, like boom!

41:10.946 --> 41:14.750
Soon as they hear it,

I am, but we may need
a little extra help.

41:37.306 --> 41:42.311
I think it's time we called
our old friend Tony Riptide.

41:43.345 --> 41:44.146
T-Rip?

41:44.179 --> 41:45.447
He's no friend, Marlon.

41:45.480 --> 41:48.050
He's a conniving monster,
a backstabbing beast.

41:48.083 --> 41:51.453
He's a vicious shark, literally.

41:51.486 --> 41:52.588
That's right, Ace.

41:52.621 --> 41:55.958
And a vicious shark is
exactly what we need

41:55.991 --> 41:59.027
to handle the feathery problem
down here in Fernville.

41:59.061 --> 42:00.729
Ring him at once.

42:00.762 --> 42:02.164
Have him come to the office.

42:02.197 --> 42:05.534
I'll make him an offer he can't
refuse.

42:05.567 --> 42:06.868

42:37.933 --> 42:39.001
Okay, guys.

42:39.034 --> 42:40.936
To prepare for the singing
competition,

42:40.969 --> 42:43.905
we gotta start running
some basic vocal exercises

42:43.939 --> 42:45.941
to get sharp and stay ready.

42:45.974 --> 42:48.210
Let's begin with a lip buzz.

42:48.243 --> 42:50.379
Simply vibrate your lips
together

42:50.412 --> 42:52.180
without worrying about pitch.

42:52.214 --> 42:53.749
This will help us build up our
breathing

42:53.782 --> 42:55.951
and stamina while we're singing.

43:17.140 --> 43:17.939
That's funny.

43:17.973 --> 43:19.341
It is kinda.

43:19.374 --> 43:22.010
Okay, now let's try our Ms.

43:22.044 --> 43:23.245
Our Ms?

43:23.278 --> 43:24.246
Yes.

43:24.279 --> 43:27.215
Sticking to one note,
also called monotone,

43:27.249 --> 43:31.386
sing "ma may me moe moo," nice
and slow,

43:31.420 --> 43:33.922
really pronouncing those Ms.

43:33.955 --> 43:35.624
It should sound like this.

43:38.660 --> 43:41.663
♪ Ma may me moe moo ♪

43:42.664 --> 43:44.133
Now you guys try it.

43:44.167 --> 43:46.702
Mmm, ma may me moo moo.

43:46.735 --> 43:51.740
♪ Mmm, ma, may, me, moe, moo ♪

43:51.940 --> 43:53.475
♪ Mmm ♪

43:53.508 --> 43:56.845
♪ Ma, may, me, moe, moo ♪

43:58.914 --> 43:59.848
Great.

43:59.881 --> 44:01.016
I really like that one.

44:01.049 --> 44:04.187
My lips are tingling, feels
like I just ate pop rocks.

44:04.219 --> 44:06.354
I didn't know hippos had lips.

44:06.388 --> 44:08.157
Or that they ate pop rocks?

44:08.191 --> 44:09.424
I know, right?

44:09.458 --> 44:11.727
Us hippos are chock full of
surprises.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.762
Okay, we're gonna sing a
little tune.

44:13.795 --> 44:14.596
All right.

44:14.629 --> 44:15.630
Wanna give it a try?

44:15.664 --> 44:16.531
Yeah.

44:16.565 --> 44:19.067
Okay, we're gonna sing I Love
to Sing.

44:19.102 --> 44:21.837
We'll start at the root,
and then hit the octave,

44:21.870 --> 44:23.505
and come back down on the fifth,

44:23.538 --> 44:25.174
third, and root of the chord
again.

44:25.208 --> 44:27.909
I have no idea what any of
that means.

44:27.943 --> 44:29.377
Can we just sing?

44:30.879 --> 44:32.347
Sure, Tiny.

44:32.380 --> 44:33.381
You guys ready?

44:33.415 --> 44:34.583
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:34.616 --> 44:36.318
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

44:36.351 --> 44:37.486
Wha?

44:37.519 --> 44:40.123
♪ If you wanna learn to sing,
then sing this with me ♪

44:40.156 --> 44:43.558

44:43.592 --> 44:44.760
What talent.

44:45.594 --> 44:49.631
Sho' enough, get closer,
softie, maybe it'll rub off.

44:49.664 --> 44:51.032
I'm good, thanks.

44:51.066 --> 44:53.502
So good to see you
again, Tony.

44:53.535 --> 44:55.003
How have you been?

44:55.036 --> 44:56.004
Fine.

44:56.037 --> 44:58.174
They opened the beach early this
year.

44:58.207 --> 44:59.808
You know how it goes.

44:59.841 --> 45:02.344
Right place, right time.

45:02.377 --> 45:04.446
Good for you.

45:04.479 --> 45:07.048
I called him here because
I have a little problem

45:07.083 --> 45:08.217
down in Fernville.

45:08.251 --> 45:09.085
Fernville?

45:09.118 --> 45:12.020
Ain't no body of water in
Fernville,

45:12.053 --> 45:14.223
just creeks and streams.

45:14.257 --> 45:16.458
You'd have to drive me in hidden
in

45:16.491 --> 45:19.262
a natural gas tanker, for
instance.

45:19.294 --> 45:23.665
Then make sure whoever you
don't like falls into my tank.

45:23.698 --> 45:24.800
Devious.

45:24.833 --> 45:26.935
I like your style, Tony.

45:26.968 --> 45:28.303
Always have.

45:28.336 --> 45:31.140
But I had something else in
mind.

45:31.174 --> 45:34.042
Something more embarrassing.

45:34.076 --> 45:34.976
Oh yeah?

45:35.010 --> 45:37.379
I'd rather eat folks than bully
'em,

45:37.412 --> 45:39.915
but hey, it's your money.

45:39.948 --> 45:43.451
Yes it is, and a nice
chunk of it can be yours

45:43.485 --> 45:44.753
if you'll help me.

45:44.786 --> 45:48.291
I know you have friends
in low places, Tony.

45:48.323 --> 45:51.593
Friends who can ensure that two
pampered,

45:51.626 --> 45:55.564
pompous, precocious
birds learn their place,

45:55.597 --> 45:58.700
and above all, that they choke
on stage

45:58.733 --> 46:02.070
in that singing
competition, if they make it

46:02.104 --> 46:03.471
on stage at all.

46:03.505 --> 46:07.676
Guarantee me that, and I can
make it worth your while.

46:07.709 --> 46:08.743
Worth my while?

46:08.777 --> 46:10.946
That's music to my gills.

46:10.979 --> 46:12.614
Where do we start?

46:12.647 --> 46:14.583
You have a certain friend who
performs

46:14.616 --> 46:17.286
powerful magic, am I right?

46:17.320 --> 46:18.620
Powerful magic?

46:18.653 --> 46:19.921
Do I ever.

46:19.955 --> 46:22.158
A word of warning, though.

46:22.191 --> 46:24.593
My friends are real bad news.

46:25.694 --> 46:28.630
Tony, it just so happens that
bad news

46:28.663 --> 46:30.665
is exactly what we need.

46:31.566 --> 46:33.236
Then say no more, Pintop.

46:33.269 --> 46:34.270
Say no more.

46:36.538 --> 46:39.141
Why don't you make like a
jet and take off, Lil Wings?

46:39.175 --> 46:40.976
Nobody wants to talk to you.

46:41.009 --> 46:44.546
Good, then I can do all
the talking, you feel me?

46:44.579 --> 46:47.515

47:11.107 --> 47:14.409
while you still got
songs to sing, softies.

47:32.527 --> 47:34.696
We'll see you on stage.

47:34.729 --> 47:36.798
You'll be seeing me, a'ight.

47:36.831 --> 47:39.335
Enjoy your exercises, softies.

47:44.973 --> 47:45.907
Hey, hey.

47:45.941 --> 47:48.443
So, this is your friend, yeah?

47:48.476 --> 47:50.279
It's not a good idea to come
on

47:50.313 --> 47:52.814
with that jabbering industry
talk, Marlon.

47:52.847 --> 47:55.351
You're not in a studio, or even
in

47:55.384 --> 47:57.420
an alley behind the studio.

47:57.452 --> 47:59.388
You're out of your element.

47:59.422 --> 48:03.658
Let me do the talking,
until things calm down.

48:03.692 --> 48:04.793
Calm down?

48:04.826 --> 48:07.096
How can things get calmer than
this?

48:07.129 --> 48:08.830
This is paradise.

48:08.863 --> 48:10.932
Everything's chill.

48:10.966 --> 48:14.337
I'd pay a lot of money to
take this kind of vacation

48:14.370 --> 48:16.205
five times a year.

48:16.238 --> 48:19.442
I know my way around paradise,
Tony.

48:19.474 --> 48:22.644
There's absolutely nothing
to be concerned about.

48:24.146 --> 48:26.614
Oh, easy, buddy, easy.

48:26.648 --> 48:28.717
He doesn't mean that.

48:28.750 --> 48:30.719
It's just the way he is.

48:30.752 --> 48:32.421
He's just brash.

48:32.455 --> 48:33.722
What's he doing there?

48:33.755 --> 48:36.325
Is he showing us some spec
magic?

48:36.359 --> 48:37.259
Good, good.

48:38.260 --> 48:40.795
I love talents that work on
spec.

48:40.829 --> 48:43.598
They gotta prove themselves,
after all.

48:43.631 --> 48:45.600
Nothing's for free.

48:45.633 --> 48:48.304
Hey, if this works out,
tell him I'll get him

48:48.337 --> 48:51.340
booked on the evening
show with Jimmy Falcon.

48:52.741 --> 48:53.708
Whoa!

48:54.876 --> 48:56.379
Surprised me there.

48:56.412 --> 48:57.679
Nice trick.

48:57.712 --> 49:00.548
What else can this big flytrap
do?

49:04.019 --> 49:05.720
Pintop, I wouldn't.

49:05.754 --> 49:07.289
Well, I would.

49:07.323 --> 49:10.426
That's why I'm me and you're
you, Tony.

49:10.459 --> 49:13.129
Now come on, let me see the good
stuff.

49:13.162 --> 49:15.063
Let me see some damage.

49:15.097 --> 49:16.265
You shouldn't say that.

49:16.298 --> 49:18.066
I'll say whatever I want.

49:18.100 --> 49:20.202
I'm paying you, remember?

49:22.271 --> 49:23.372
You asked for it.

49:23.406 --> 49:25.241
Okay, I get it.

49:25.274 --> 49:26.641
I'm good now.

49:27.742 --> 49:31.846
Pintop, meet Namnam,
my friend who does magic.

49:32.714 --> 49:34.383
All righty, all good here.

49:34.417 --> 49:38.320
Let's not get too carried
away now, Mr. Namnam.

49:39.921 --> 49:41.390
Now you've done it.

49:41.424 --> 49:42.224
Done what?

49:42.258 --> 49:43.526
What have I done?

49:43.558 --> 49:44.859
You made Namnam mad.

49:44.893 --> 49:46.928
You're on borrowed time, Pintop.

49:46.961 --> 49:49.597
Me too, if you don't
get on with it,

49:49.631 --> 49:51.534
and tell him what you want.

49:51.566 --> 49:53.536
He ain't happy I brought you.

49:53.568 --> 49:57.406
Not happy you, does he know
who I am?

49:58.407 --> 49:59.841
Yeesh, he's agile.

49:59.874 --> 50:01.810
Talk to him, Pintop.

50:01.843 --> 50:03.079
Talk to him.

50:03.112 --> 50:04.712
All right, all right.

50:04.746 --> 50:08.350
Mr. Namnam,
my name is Marlon Pintop,

50:08.384 --> 50:12.288
world famous music producer
and industry impresario.

50:13.888 --> 50:15.657
I have this kid who's
going to be a huge star,

50:15.690 --> 50:17.725
and I want him to win the
Fernville singing competition.

50:17.759 --> 50:20.463
But these pesky, marginally
talented birds

50:20.496 --> 50:23.232
are a threat to upstage
him, and we can't have that.

50:23.265 --> 50:25.700
We gotta win this thing
to secure his debut

50:25.733 --> 50:28.603
as the animal kingdom's most
gifted entertainer ever,

50:28.636 --> 50:31.507
or else they might clamor for
more of these winged goofs

50:31.540 --> 50:33.908
and not my boy, Lil Wings.

50:33.942 --> 50:35.478
Little Wings?

50:35.511 --> 50:36.711
That's his name.

50:36.744 --> 50:39.681
Well, Lil Wings Fresh
Quills is his full name,

50:39.714 --> 50:40.982
not his real name.

50:41.015 --> 50:44.153
His real name's Brad,
nobody knows that but us,

50:44.186 --> 50:45.653
and now you.

50:45.687 --> 50:46.955
Whoa!

50:46.988 --> 50:48.656
This plant talks.

50:48.690 --> 50:49.924
Keep going, Pintop.

50:49.958 --> 50:52.528
Namnam isn't big on patience.

50:52.561 --> 50:54.963
Right, I gotta stop
these Fernville freaks

50:54.996 --> 50:56.599
from screwing up our big plans.

50:56.631 --> 50:59.168
So I was thinking of a sneaky
magic spell

50:59.201 --> 51:01.270
that'd ruin their ability to
stay on key

51:01.303 --> 51:03.372
and sing anything even remotely
good,

51:03.405 --> 51:04.939
shattering their hopes and
dreams

51:04.973 --> 51:07.443
so thoroughly and absolutely
that they won't even

51:07.476 --> 51:09.211
dare compete against Lil Wings.

51:09.245 --> 51:12.013
And if they do, they're
so utterly humiliated,

51:12.046 --> 51:14.983
it's the last time any
of them sing anymore

51:15.016 --> 51:18.154
for anyone, ever again, whew.

51:18.187 --> 51:19.588
Is that it?

51:19.622 --> 51:20.855
That's it.

51:20.889 --> 51:23.192
That's all we came to ask,
Namnam.

51:23.225 --> 51:25.127
What do you say, big guy?

51:25.161 --> 51:27.530
Namnam hates Fernville.

51:27.563 --> 51:28.430
So?

51:28.464 --> 51:29.797
That's a yes?

51:29.831 --> 51:31.233
Nom destroy!

51:31.267 --> 51:32.268
Yes!

51:32.301 --> 51:33.536
Yes!

51:33.569 --> 51:35.371
Okay, Marshall, you're up
next.

51:35.404 --> 51:37.206
What song would you like to
sing?

51:37.239 --> 51:40.008
I'm gonna try that oldie but
goodie we all know and love,

51:40.041 --> 51:42.645
Your Nest is like a Cloud Nine
to Me.

51:42.677 --> 51:44.346
Cool, I love that one.

51:44.380 --> 51:45.581
Me too.

51:45.614 --> 51:46.714
Take it away, buddy.

51:46.748 --> 51:48.117

51:49.451 --> 51:52.655

52:40.768 --> 52:42.104
Was that the same song?

52:42.137 --> 52:44.106
It sounded different.

52:44.139 --> 52:45.374
That was weird.

52:45.407 --> 52:48.210
I had a frog in my throat, or
something.

52:48.244 --> 52:50.878
Yeah, that sounded pretty
weird.

52:50.912 --> 52:54.782
Drink some water or something,
and let me give it a shot.

52:54.816 --> 52:55.618

53:16.639 --> 53:17.839
I think we're off key.

53:17.872 --> 53:19.141
Off key?

53:19.174 --> 53:21.076
How's that possible?

53:21.110 --> 53:23.811
We're birds,
we're always on key.

53:23.845 --> 53:27.216
You were both
pretty far off key.

53:27.249 --> 53:29.285
Yeah, you were.

53:29.318 --> 53:30.386
That's strange.

53:30.419 --> 53:32.521
We know that song like
the back of our wings.

53:32.554 --> 53:34.223
Why don't we try another one?

53:34.256 --> 53:37.859
How about Goril,
You Drive Me Bananas?

53:37.892 --> 53:39.161
By the Bamboo Shoots?

53:39.194 --> 53:39.994
Yeah.

53:40.028 --> 53:40.828
Okay.

53:40.862 --> 53:41.863

53:48.970 --> 53:51.674

really sound like that.

53:51.707 --> 53:54.076
Something about
this stinks, you guys.

53:54.109 --> 53:57.680
How in the world can we
forget how to stay on key?

53:57.713 --> 54:01.015
Nobody just wakes up one
day and forgets how to sing.

54:01.049 --> 54:02.817
Nobody but us, apparently.

54:02.850 --> 54:05.521
And the singing competition
is right around the corner.

54:05.554 --> 54:06.722
What are we gonna do?

54:06.755 --> 54:07.989
Drink hot tea.

54:08.022 --> 54:09.857
Gargle with salt water.

54:09.891 --> 54:12.661
One thing's for sure, we
need to figure this out,

54:12.695 --> 54:13.529
and fast.

54:14.430 --> 54:15.863
There's no time to waste.

54:15.897 --> 54:18.267
I know, let's go see the music
teacher

54:18.300 --> 54:20.402
who made us fall in love with
singing in the first place.

54:20.436 --> 54:21.637
Who's that?

54:21.670 --> 54:22.837
Professor Harper.

54:22.870 --> 54:27.209
Great Scott, this is a
quantum conundrum indeed.

54:27.242 --> 54:29.578
No one's ever regressed this
dramatically

54:29.611 --> 54:33.014
in their ability to sing on key,
ever!

54:33.047 --> 54:34.048
Oh, great.

54:35.150 --> 54:37.486
So we've solidified our
spot as the biggest failures

54:37.519 --> 54:39.053
to ever graduate your class?

54:39.088 --> 54:40.855
We're sorry, Professor Harper.

54:40.888 --> 54:43.258
We don't know what's
wrong, and we don't know

54:43.292 --> 54:44.626
where else to turn.

54:44.660 --> 54:47.763
Well, just from speaking
with you for five minutes,

54:47.796 --> 54:50.932
I can see you've completely
forgotten music theory,

54:50.965 --> 54:53.402
chord progressions, vocal
warm-ups,

54:53.435 --> 54:56.938
and drawn an absolute
blank on any of the songs

54:56.971 --> 54:58.940
you used to know by heart.

54:58.973 --> 55:00.142
I don't get it.

55:00.175 --> 55:01.210
Are we stupid?

55:01.243 --> 55:04.946
No, Marshall, you're not
stupid, neither of you.

55:04.979 --> 55:08.751
I fear the source of your
issues is far more malevolent

55:08.784 --> 55:10.119
than simple idiocy.

55:10.152 --> 55:11.687
What could it be, Professor?

55:11.720 --> 55:15.491
I believe you two have
been assailed by a hex.

55:15.524 --> 55:16.658
- A hex?
- A hex?

55:16.692 --> 55:17.860
That's correct.

55:17.892 --> 55:20.928
Some secret party has
leveled a magical curse

55:20.962 --> 55:23.399
upon your heads, in a misguided
effort

55:23.432 --> 55:26.702
to spoil your chances
in that singing contest.

55:26.735 --> 55:28.237
Oh no!

55:28.270 --> 55:29.371
But why us?

55:29.405 --> 55:30.938
What did we ever do to anybody?

55:30.972 --> 55:32.341
I'm afraid that's a question

55:32.374 --> 55:34.643
only you two pigeons can answer.

55:34.676 --> 55:37.780
Have you harbored any
enemies in Fernville?

55:37.813 --> 55:42.418
Anyone with whom you've
experienced friction or ill will?

55:43.285 --> 55:45.920
Yes, that jerk Lil Wings.

55:45.953 --> 55:47.756
And that creep, Marlon Pintop.

55:47.790 --> 55:48.824
Oh dear.

55:48.857 --> 55:51.393
If you've run afoul of Mr.
Pintop,

55:51.427 --> 55:53.829
I fear this hex
may be more difficult

55:53.862 --> 55:56.698
to snap than simple reverse
magic.

55:56.732 --> 55:59.134
He's incredibly petty.

55:59.168 --> 56:03.004
He's known to hold grudges
for years, even decades.

56:03.037 --> 56:04.139
Oh great.

56:04.173 --> 56:05.641
How can we ever overcome this?

56:05.674 --> 56:06.642
We're doomed!

56:06.675 --> 56:08.610
Not necessarily, Marshall.

56:08.644 --> 56:11.513
If indeed this is the
nature of your problem,

56:11.547 --> 56:13.482
there may still be a way.

56:13.515 --> 56:16.752
It's a long shot, but if
we've guessed correctly,

56:16.785 --> 56:19.087
it may be your only hope.

56:19.121 --> 56:20.923
Tell us, Professor, tell us
what to do!

56:20.955 --> 56:23.991
You must venture forth
and find the only creature

56:24.025 --> 56:27.229
in our land with the
ability to lift a dark hex.

56:27.262 --> 56:29.264
Radella the fairy snail.

56:30.299 --> 56:31.500
Radella?

56:31.533 --> 56:34.068
Tell us, where can we find
this fairy snail, Professor?

56:34.102 --> 56:35.103
You don't.

56:35.137 --> 56:37.473
If indeed there's a hex upon
your heads,

56:37.506 --> 56:39.575
Radella will find you.

56:39.608 --> 56:42.311
Leave town taking the dirt
road that leads north.

56:42.344 --> 56:45.214
If she smells dark magic, she'll
emerge

56:45.247 --> 56:47.249
to confront you and combat it.

56:47.282 --> 56:48.383
What if she doesn't emerge?

56:48.417 --> 56:51.052
Then I suppose you're both out
of luck,

56:51.086 --> 56:53.489
and you may never sing again.

56:53.522 --> 56:54.590
Off you go.

56:54.623 --> 56:56.458
Good luck to you both.

56:59.094 --> 57:01.964
Oh Marshall, what if
this Radella isn't willing,

57:01.996 --> 57:04.366
or able to help us?

57:04.399 --> 57:06.468
What if Professor Harper was
right,

57:06.502 --> 57:08.403
and we never sing again?

57:08.437 --> 57:10.873
Then I guess Lil Wings Fresh
Quill

57:10.906 --> 57:12.474
will win that competition,
and Marlon Pintop

57:12.508 --> 57:15.344
will be the measuring stick
of musical talent forever.

57:15.377 --> 57:18.447
That's a terrible
thought, just terrible!

57:18.480 --> 57:21.083
I wonder how much farther we
have to go.

57:21.116 --> 57:22.518
We could go another 10 feet,

57:22.551 --> 57:24.987
or we could go until the drop.

57:25.019 --> 57:26.188
There's no way to tell.

57:26.221 --> 57:27.923
I'm gonna stop asking you
questions.

57:27.956 --> 57:29.958
You only make things worse.

57:29.992 --> 57:30.959
What can I say?

57:30.993 --> 57:33.228
I'm droppin' truth.

57:33.262 --> 57:35.330
This is it, everyone.

57:35.364 --> 57:39.268
The eve of the big show, and
the dawn of the biggest star

57:39.301 --> 57:42.069
to come out of what they call
Fernville,

57:42.104 --> 57:44.339
Lil Wings Fresh Quills.

57:44.373 --> 57:47.809
♪ I come out swingin' at the
bell singin' pop, pop, pop, pop ♪

57:47.843 --> 57:49.611
♪ Double with rhythm
and bubble with rhyme ♪

57:49.645 --> 57:51.713
♪ Your jaws drop, drop, drop ♪

57:51.747 --> 57:53.215
Save it for the competition, Q.

57:53.248 --> 57:56.952
Soak it in and bask in the
glory, because after that,

57:56.985 --> 57:58.820
the real work begins.

57:58.854 --> 58:00.455
You mean we're gonna start
recording

58:00.489 --> 58:02.524
my second album already, Marlon?

58:02.558 --> 58:03.392
No.

58:03.425 --> 58:04.993
We're going to update your
image.

58:05.027 --> 58:07.996
You've been wearing that same
shirt since I've known you.

58:08.030 --> 58:09.631
This shirt's fly, y'all.

58:09.665 --> 58:11.533
You don't see these nowhere.

58:11.567 --> 58:13.235
Yes, and when we're finished,

58:13.268 --> 58:15.771
you really won't see it nowhere.

58:15.804 --> 58:17.071
Boss, I been thinking.

58:17.105 --> 58:18.840
I thought I smelled fire.

58:18.874 --> 58:22.511
I was afraid one of these
sconces sparked the blinds again.

58:22.544 --> 58:23.946
Right.

58:23.979 --> 58:25.881
Hey, what do you think about
finding

58:25.914 --> 58:27.983
some new voices in the outbacks?

58:28.016 --> 58:30.085
I can set some traps in the
underbrush,

58:30.118 --> 58:32.187
and record them yelling when
their toes

58:32.220 --> 58:33.555
and tails get caught.

58:33.589 --> 58:35.724
You can review 'em and really
get a feel

58:35.757 --> 58:38.727
for the animal's raw skills.

58:38.760 --> 58:40.162
Then, if you like one, I'll go
snatch them

58:40.195 --> 58:42.364
and bring 'em back here.

58:42.397 --> 58:45.133
You can lock 'em up and work
with them around the clock.

58:45.167 --> 58:47.569
In-house, home-grown talent.

58:47.603 --> 58:48.670
What you think?

58:48.704 --> 58:50.672
That's also called kidnapping.

58:50.706 --> 58:52.307
Let the boss talk, toothy.

58:52.341 --> 58:55.377
You better never go
for a swim, goofy face.

58:55.410 --> 58:56.311
Enough.

58:56.345 --> 58:58.280
My plate's full right now, Ace.

58:58.313 --> 59:00.282
But way to think outside the
box.

59:00.315 --> 59:01.316
Keep it up.

59:01.350 --> 59:02.751
Thanks Marlon, I will.

59:02.784 --> 59:05.253
Did you give anymore
thought to that ape Ronda?

59:05.287 --> 59:06.788
No, none at all.

59:06.822 --> 59:10.459
Oh, well, I think she
could be a megastar.

59:10.492 --> 59:12.828
She's got the look and the
swagger.

59:12.861 --> 59:16.031
♪ My swag's up in your face,
it's going bling, bling, bling ♪

59:16.064 --> 59:19.701

59:19.735 --> 59:23.071

59:26.408 --> 59:28.077
Work on that last line.

59:28.111 --> 59:30.079
Aww, you don't like it?

59:30.113 --> 59:30.912
No.

59:30.946 --> 59:31.947
A'ight.

59:31.980 --> 59:33.315
I could do like...

59:33.348 --> 59:35.417
♪ I knock you out

59:35.450 --> 59:37.052
♪ The bell goes

59:37.086 --> 59:38.353

59:38.387 --> 59:39.655
A'ight.

59:53.535 --> 59:54.936
Whoa.

59:54.970 --> 59:56.571
Look at that thing, Mimi.

59:56.605 --> 59:58.507
I think it's one of those
flytrap plants.

59:58.540 --> 1:00:00.242
Be careful,
Marshall, it's huge.

1:00:00.275 --> 1:00:02.644
Don't get too close to it.

1:00:02.678 --> 1:00:05.647
It can detect vibrations
all around itself.

1:00:05.681 --> 1:00:08.117
It can snap us up
without even looking.

1:00:08.151 --> 1:00:08.950
Nom.

1:00:08.984 --> 1:00:10.052
Uh-oh.

1:00:10.086 --> 1:00:11.219
I think it heard you.

1:00:11.253 --> 1:00:12.421
Back away slowly.

1:00:12.454 --> 1:00:14.322
Don't want to wake it up.

1:00:14.356 --> 1:00:15.190
Okay.

1:00:15.223 --> 1:00:16.024
No!

1:00:16.058 --> 1:00:16.958
Oh.

1:00:16.992 --> 1:00:18.161
I don't want to be
plant lunch.

1:00:18.193 --> 1:00:19.227
Stop!

1:00:19.261 --> 1:00:20.062
Huh?

1:00:20.096 --> 1:00:20.996
Who said that?

1:00:21.029 --> 1:00:23.965
Back, seed spawn, back,
conjurer.

1:00:25.934 --> 1:00:27.235
Hey, birds.

1:00:27.269 --> 1:00:28.270
I'm Radella.

1:00:29.138 --> 1:00:31.540
I think you're lookin' for me.

1:00:32.507 --> 1:00:33.542
Radella?

1:00:33.575 --> 1:00:36.478
Yes, we've been searching
high and low for you.

1:00:36.511 --> 1:00:37.879
Need some help?

1:00:37.913 --> 1:00:39.047
Yes, we do!

1:00:39.082 --> 1:00:43.885
'Kay, hang on a sec while
I take care of this weed.

1:00:43.919 --> 1:00:44.720
Nom!

1:00:45.587 --> 1:00:46.388
Yikes!

1:00:46.421 --> 1:00:48.423
Is that all you got,
green bean?

1:00:48.457 --> 1:00:49.291
Now shoo!

1:00:53.495 --> 1:00:55.030
Not today, sprout.

1:00:55.063 --> 1:00:56.798
Just go now.

1:00:56.832 --> 1:01:00.136
Or you'll have to deal with
Radella.

1:01:02.337 --> 1:01:04.906
She did it, Radella
did it, she saved us.

1:01:04.940 --> 1:01:06.142
Thanks, Radella.

1:01:06.175 --> 1:01:09.010
We don't know what we'd have
done if you hadn't come along.

1:01:09.044 --> 1:01:12.115
You'd be halfway
digested by now,

1:01:12.148 --> 1:01:14.549
probably still alive, and...

1:01:14.583 --> 1:01:17.719
We don't need to hear
specifics, please.

1:01:17.753 --> 1:01:18.553
Whew.

1:01:18.587 --> 1:01:19.888
That was a close call.

1:01:19.921 --> 1:01:22.191
Welcome to my turf.

1:01:22.225 --> 1:01:24.993
Not exactly Fernville, huh?

1:01:25.026 --> 1:01:27.529
Now, what brings you two birds

1:01:28.430 --> 1:01:32.834
all the way out here
looking for little old me?

1:01:32.868 --> 1:01:35.804
We're birds, and we're good
singers.

1:01:35.837 --> 1:01:39.208
But we've completely
forgotten how to carry a tune,

1:01:39.242 --> 1:01:41.309
match pitch, or stay in key.

1:01:41.343 --> 1:01:42.944
We think we might
have been hexed.

1:01:42.978 --> 1:01:45.580
Oh, there's no
might've about it.

1:01:45.614 --> 1:01:48.350
You two are trailin' a dark
cloud

1:01:49.351 --> 1:01:52.621
as wide as this jungle itself.

1:01:53.488 --> 1:01:54.389
We are?

1:01:54.422 --> 1:01:55.624
Oh yeah.

1:01:55.657 --> 1:01:58.660
I picked up on it hours ago.

1:01:58.693 --> 1:02:01.197
Could smell it for miles away.

1:02:02.297 --> 1:02:07.435
Got here as fast as I could,
but I'm a snail, you know?

1:02:07.469 --> 1:02:09.205
I only move so quick.

1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:12.407
We understand.

1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:14.042
Is there anything you can do
to help us?

1:02:14.076 --> 1:02:17.412
As a matter of fact, there is.

1:02:17.445 --> 1:02:22.084
Ordinarily, this would
be a tough hex to break,

1:02:22.118 --> 1:02:26.588
but seeing as how your
hexer lives in this jungle,

1:02:26.621 --> 1:02:28.657
we should be able to lift it.

1:02:29.524 --> 1:02:30.492
Who is it?

1:02:30.525 --> 1:02:31.593
Namnam.

1:02:31.626 --> 1:02:33.628
But we don't even know him.

1:02:33.662 --> 1:02:35.597
We've never seen him before in
our lives.

1:02:35.630 --> 1:02:37.732
It wasn't his idea.

1:02:37.766 --> 1:02:41.570
He's nothin' more than a
mercenary plant.

1:02:41.603 --> 1:02:46.408
You have sneakier enemies
who want to see you fail.

1:02:46.441 --> 1:02:50.345
They're the ones who negotiated
your hex.

1:02:50.378 --> 1:02:52.614
They are your real problem.

1:02:53.515 --> 1:02:54.416
Yes.

1:02:54.449 --> 1:02:57.586
And we think we know exactly who
they are.

1:02:57.619 --> 1:02:59.421
Marlon Pintop and Lil Wings.

1:02:59.454 --> 1:03:01.857
If you'd like, we can not only

1:03:01.890 --> 1:03:06.528
lift the hex off your
heads, but we can place it

1:03:06.561 --> 1:03:10.932
upon the heads of those
who would do you wrong.

1:03:10.966 --> 1:03:12.868
Oh, yes, please.

1:03:12.901 --> 1:03:14.237
Yeah, let's.

1:03:14.270 --> 1:03:15.070
Done.

1:03:15.104 --> 1:03:17.906
Let's get started, birds.

1:03:17.939 --> 1:03:20.008
This is it, Fernvillians.

1:03:20.041 --> 1:03:22.711
The day you've all been waiting
for.

1:03:22.744 --> 1:03:25.780
Welcome one and all to
the hotly anticipated

1:03:25.814 --> 1:03:28.016
Fernville singing competition.

1:03:28.049 --> 1:03:30.886
Animals of all species
have come from far and wide

1:03:30.919 --> 1:03:34.022
to try their luck and show
off their unique talents

1:03:34.055 --> 1:03:35.724
on this very night.

1:03:35.757 --> 1:03:38.160
But you hear me run my mouth all
the time.

1:03:38.194 --> 1:03:40.263
You're probably sick of me by
now.

1:03:40.296 --> 1:03:41.696
Yeah, beat it!

1:03:41.730 --> 1:03:43.299
Scram, we beg!

1:03:43.332 --> 1:03:44.733
Okay, okay.

1:03:44.766 --> 1:03:46.902
You don't have to agree so
vehemently.

1:03:46.935 --> 1:03:48.870
I'm just doing my job here.

1:03:48.904 --> 1:03:52.607
Now, without further ado,
let's turn this show over

1:03:52.641 --> 1:03:54.042
to the real talent.

1:03:54.076 --> 1:03:58.046
Here she is, fresh off
an impressive showing

Go splash some water on

1:05:35.311 --> 1:05:36.445
Okay.

1:05:36.479 --> 1:05:39.514
Next up, you remember this guy.

1:05:39.547 --> 1:05:40.982
How can we forget?

1:05:41.016 --> 1:05:43.285
A new star is born!

1:05:43.319 --> 1:05:45.587
Well, let's not get carried
away now.

1:05:45.620 --> 1:05:48.923
Making his way to the stage,
here he is.

1:05:48.957 --> 1:05:52.694
Better get that name right,
or you're out of a job, dear.

1:05:52.727 --> 1:05:55.097
Yeah, pay attention, cue card
face.

1:05:55.131 --> 1:05:56.931
What's my name, bird?

1:05:56.965 --> 1:06:00.369
Little, I mean, Lil Wings
Fresh Quills!

1:06:03.272 --> 1:06:06.041
You're lucky, get off my
stage.

1:06:08.910 --> 1:06:10.845
Go ahead, go ahead and boo.

1:06:10.879 --> 1:06:15.317
This here's a new number, I
just wrote it, for all y'all.

1:06:15.351 --> 1:06:17.219
Hit 'em where it hurst, Q!
