do you have to be scared of?

38:52.895 --> 38:54.636
- [Axel] I'm sure there's
no immediate danger,

38:54.767 --> 38:57.160
but it would probably
be a good idea to make

38:57.291 --> 39:00.033
sure your cars are locked
and your eyes are open.

39:00.163 --> 39:03.166
- [Lana] Should we be scared?

39:03.297 --> 39:06.648
- If you see something, say
something and let me know.

39:26.973 --> 39:28.496

40:34.823 --> 40:36.521
- Just Axel, what's going on?

40:36.651 --> 40:38.436
- There were these
two guys in the alley

40:38.566 --> 40:40.394
and they buried something,
they had a white van.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.918

just go check it out

41:28.877 --> 41:30.792
Look, y'all just stay here okay.

41:30.923 --> 41:32.402

41:57.340 --> 42:00.387
All right, look let's just
go and keep this safe.

43:15.070 --> 43:16.332

43:16.463 --> 43:18.204
routine like that,
they'll never win.

43:18.334 --> 43:19.814
- Not against us.

43:19.945 --> 43:21.773
- She can't even do
a cartwheel right.

43:21.903 --> 43:24.819
- See that girl right
there, thunder thighs.

43:24.950 --> 43:26.821
- [Andrea] See that
one, daddy long legs.

43:26.952 --> 43:28.736
- You guys are so mean.

43:28.867 --> 43:30.782

59:12.940 --> 59:14.202
- How could you be so heartless.

59:14.333 --> 59:17.205
[Michelle sobbing]

59:17.336 --> 59:19.860
- All right girls, girls go
back to y'alls rooms okay.

59:19.991 --> 59:22.559
I'm gonna come up
with a plan and we're

59:22.689 --> 59:24.517
gonna get Theo back, all right?

59:24.648 --> 59:27.433
[Michelle sobbing]

59:28.695 --> 59:31.306
[dramatic music]

59:40.446 --> 59:43.101
[dramatic music]

59:46.495 --> 59:47.932
This reminds me of that
time I shot that groundhog.

59:48.062 --> 59:51.500
[dramatic music]

59:51.631 --> 59:52.371
Yeah.

59:52.501 --> 59:55.113
[dramatic music]

59:56.810 --> 59:57.594
I got it.

59:57.724 --> 59:59.552
[dramatic music]

59:59.683 --> 01:00:02.120
[upbeat music]

01:00:24.446 --> 01:00:26.971
[door creaking]

01:00:28.102 --> 01:00:28.929
- [Pamela] Axel has a plan okay.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.235
Are you okay?

01:00:30.365 --> 01:00:32.063
- No, leave me alone.

01:00:32.193 --> 01:00:34.631
[upbeat music]

01:00:37.024 --> 01:00:38.156
I can't believe he's gone.

01:00:38.286 --> 01:00:39.461
- [Andrea] He's not gone.

01:00:41.507 --> 01:00:43.204
- Should have never come here.

01:00:43.335 --> 01:00:44.728
Should have never brought Theo.

01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:47.469
[dramatic music]

01:00:50.821 --> 01:00:51.604
[girls yelling]

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.345
- [Girls] Oh!

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:58.002
- [Lana] Mr. Johnson told
me to use this shower

01:00:58.132 --> 01:01:00.047
because mine was out of order.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.746
Are you guys okay?

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:07.315
What's the matter,
what happened?

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:09.013
- They took Theo.

01:01:09.143 --> 01:01:10.623
- They took your dog?

01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:11.842
Who would do that?

01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:13.060
- They want an exchange.

01:01:14.888 --> 01:01:17.543
- We were sunbathing when we
saw these guys in the alley,

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.850
and then they hid something,
and then they saw us,

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.243
and then we went told
Axel, and then we got it,

01:01:22.374 --> 01:01:24.463
and then they took
Theo, and now he's gone.

01:01:24.593 --> 01:01:26.378
- What you gonna do?

01:01:26.508 --> 01:01:29.250
- Axel has a plan, it's
just no particular one.

01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:31.644
[dramatic music]

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:33.167
- Well I will help you.

01:01:34.342 --> 01:01:36.170
Let me take this off my face

01:01:36.301 --> 01:01:37.432
and I'm gonna talk to you.

01:01:40.218 --> 01:01:42.046
We'll get your dog.

01:01:42.176 --> 01:01:44.788
[dramatic music]

01:01:49.793 --> 01:01:52.578
- I got it.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:53.710
- [Andrea] You know what,
I want to take a chainsaw

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.234
to those guys that took Theo.

01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:57.539
- [Pamela] I don't blame you,

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:58.540
but violence is
never the answer.

01:01:58.671 --> 01:02:00.107
- Guys.

01:02:00.238 --> 01:02:01.543
- [Pamela] Okay
look, Theo wouldn't

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:03.284
want us laying
around crying right?

01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:06.244
- Right, he's strong
and so are we.

01:02:06.374 --> 01:02:08.159
- Hey so we got
this, let's do it.

01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:09.073
- Come on.

01:02:09.203 --> 01:02:11.466
[upbeat music]

01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:20.432
[dramatic music]

01:02:20.562 --> 01:02:21.999
- Thanks for coming girls.

01:02:22.129 --> 01:02:26.394
Now, this is our camp and we're

01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:27.961
gonna get Mr. Theo
back, I promise.

01:02:28.092 --> 01:02:30.137
And here's how.

01:02:31.965 --> 01:02:34.185
By a show of hands, how many
of you been groundhog hunting?

01:02:34.315 --> 01:02:36.753
[upbeat music]

01:02:39.451 --> 01:02:40.800
All right better
question, how many

01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:42.323
of y'all know what
a ground hog is?

01:02:42.454 --> 01:02:44.935
[upbeat music]

01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:51.724
Just, just know basically
the point is you got

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:54.335
to get there before
the groundhog, and
you got to be ready.

01:02:54.466 --> 01:02:57.817
Now this plan that
I have come up with

01:02:57.948 --> 01:03:01.734
has a job for each of you, okay?

01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:03.736
Here's what's going down.

01:03:03.867 --> 01:03:06.478
[dramatic music]

01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:11.483
Everything was checked
and double checked.

01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:13.920
I've dealt with low
lives before and I knew

01:03:14.051 --> 01:03:16.662
I had to come up with
something they wouldn't expect.

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:19.230
They didn't know who
they were dealing with.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.275
Axel Johnson, the fourth.

01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:26.106
Tension in the air was so thick,

01:03:26.237 --> 01:03:28.326
even the dogs were
getting antsy.

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:30.502
Just like I told the girls
about the groundhogs,

01:03:30.632 --> 01:03:32.634
I knew they'd be coming early.

01:03:32.765 --> 01:03:37.378
AJ had been out front all
morning watching, just in case.

01:03:38.771 --> 01:03:40.164
I had set up the meeting
to our advantage.

01:03:40.294 --> 01:03:42.427
The girls were ready and
waiting at strategic points.

01:03:42.557 --> 01:03:45.125
Pamela was supposed
to be on the gate,

01:03:45.256 --> 01:03:47.693
Andrea was in the
palm fronds, and that

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:50.739
Yugoslavia cheerleader was
in the other palm fronds.

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:53.742
Even one of those
promoters was standing by.

01:03:53.873 --> 01:03:56.093
He was itching to tag on it.

01:03:56.223 --> 01:03:57.616
I'd managed to get
the place pretty much

01:03:57.746 --> 01:03:59.574
emptied out to minimize
any collateral damage.

01:03:59.705 --> 01:04:01.881
[dramatic music]

01:04:02.012 --> 01:04:05.189
Attention all Camp Cheer
finalists, the hospitality

01:04:05.319 --> 01:04:08.061
suite has been set up for
you at the high school.

01:04:08.192 --> 01:04:10.847
We hope you all have a good
time exploring our town.

01:04:10.977 --> 01:04:12.718
[dramatic music]

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.851
Remember you don't have
to be back until dark.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.071
Anyway, I was ready.

01:04:19.246 --> 01:04:20.421
The final cars were leaving.

01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:25.209
I can, I can feel 'em.

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:33.130
- All right guys,
here's the plan.

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.174
We're gonna double cross them.

01:04:34.305 --> 01:04:35.828
- What do you mean?

01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:38.222
- We told them 5:30 arrival,
let's get there at 3:30.

01:04:38.352 --> 01:04:40.789
You know what scratch that,
make it three o'clock.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.921
- Okay.
[phone ringing]

01:04:42.052 --> 01:04:44.141
- Give me one second.

01:04:44.271 --> 01:04:45.707
Yeah.

01:04:45.838 --> 01:04:49.015
- They're gone, all
right great thanks.

01:04:49.146 --> 01:04:50.756
- Who was that?

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.627
- That was Nick and Vic, I had
them early doing a stakeout.

01:04:52.758 --> 01:04:53.846
We're gonna go in
and out real quick.

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:56.196
All right got it, let's go.

01:04:56.327 --> 01:05:00.984
Let's go, let's go right
now, let's do this.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.073
- [Axel] We got this,
everybody just stay

01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:05.989
calm and stick to the plan.

01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:09.731
[dramatic music]

01:05:09.862 --> 01:05:11.995
Since AJ was mayor,
he done had two kids

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:16.129
and had been baiting a
previous altercation,

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.436
I decided to send him out
to cover the back gate.

01:05:18.566 --> 01:05:20.742
Just stay on your toes.

01:05:20.873 --> 01:05:23.571
[dramatic music]

01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:33.886
Our resident lumberjack,
Easel Johnson, no relation,

01:05:34.017 --> 01:05:36.454
had volunteered to be
bait, you know to let them

01:05:36.584 --> 01:05:39.022
think they had the upper hand.

01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:40.937
Actually, we figured
there were gonna try

01:05:41.067 --> 01:05:44.331
to knock him out, so he kind of

01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:47.552
volunteered to be
more of a pinata.

01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:51.425
We were all waiting for them,

01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:53.210
and we had a few
surprises of our own.

01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:55.473
Any minute now.

01:05:58.824 --> 01:06:00.652
I got 'em.

01:06:00.782 --> 01:06:05.352
Everyone get ready, looks like
the party's about to begin.

01:06:06.092 --> 01:06:08.268
[dramatic music]

01:06:12.185 --> 01:06:13.970
- [Pamela] They just
passed checkpoint A.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.712
- [Axel] Copy, now
real quick sneak back

01:06:17.843 --> 01:06:20.802
into stage one the back way.

01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:23.631
[dramatic music]

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.592
- They just passed point B.

01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:30.377
- [Axel] Copy, meet
up with Michelle,

01:06:30.508 --> 01:06:31.988
and get ready to
take these guys down.

01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:34.729
[dramatic music]

01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:42.563
You have to press the
button and let it go.

01:06:42.694 --> 01:06:43.477
[radio static]

01:06:43.608 --> 01:06:45.044
No don't press it again.

01:06:45.175 --> 01:06:48.178
No okay, I know
it's confusing Lana.

01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:49.831
[speaking foreign language]

01:06:49.962 --> 01:06:53.357
Lana, Lana, okay
Jacob do your thing.

01:06:53.487 --> 01:06:55.837
[dramatic music]

01:06:55.968 --> 01:06:56.795
- [Jacob] Yeah I see 'em, I'm

01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:58.449
moving to stage one as per plan.

01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:00.103
[dramatic music]

01:07:00.233 --> 01:07:02.496
- [Axel] Copy and get ready
to take these guys down.

01:07:02.627 --> 01:07:04.194
- [Jacob] Gotcha.

01:07:04.324 --> 01:07:05.978
- [Axel] Get ready Diesel,
they're right behind you.

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:08.720
[dramatic music]

01:07:12.637 --> 01:07:13.377
You're ready.

01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:14.856
[metal clanking]

01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:16.206
[dramatic music]

01:07:16.336 --> 01:07:17.685
See a pinata.

01:07:17.816 --> 01:07:20.427
[dramatic music]

01:07:25.824 --> 01:07:28.305
[upbeat music]

01:07:56.202 --> 01:07:57.769
- Where's Theo?

01:07:57.899 --> 01:07:59.684
- Shh, I'm talking to you,
you little cheerleader.

01:07:59.814 --> 01:08:01.033
Who are you?

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:03.035
- Axel Johnson, I'm
the manager here.

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:05.081
- Well Axel Johnson,
is that for me?

01:08:05.211 --> 01:08:07.561
- Well that depends,
you got the dog?

01:08:07.692 --> 01:08:09.694
- Yeah I got the
dog, he's outside.

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:10.651
I got proof of life.

01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:15.569
- Theo.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.354
[dramatic music]

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:21.618
- Where I come
from, we don't treat

01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:22.837
pretty little ladies like this.

01:08:22.968 --> 01:08:23.925
- I don't care
where you come from,

01:08:24.055 --> 01:08:25.448
just give me the stuff I want.

01:08:25.578 --> 01:08:27.189
[dramatic music]

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:28.974
- Here's your
schematics, take it

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:29.930
and get the hell out of here.

01:08:30.062 --> 01:08:32.760
[dramatic music]

01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:35.589
- It's all in here.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.069
[dramatic music]

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:38.939
All there.

01:08:39.071 --> 01:08:39.767
- [Axel] Yeah.

01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:41.247
[dramatic music]

01:08:41.377 --> 01:08:42.029
- [Thug] Come here,
come here you.

01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:44.642
[upbeat music]

01:08:57.089 --> 01:08:59.526
[man groaning]

01:09:01.441 --> 01:09:06.142
[man groaning]
[Lana screaming]

01:09:08.404 --> 01:09:10.841
[upbeat music]

01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:18.066
[fists thudding]
[upbeat music]

01:09:19.502 --> 01:09:24.247

[upbeat music]

01:09:43.787 --> 01:09:45.093
[man groaning]

01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:46.834
[upbeat music]

01:09:46.965 --> 01:09:48.575
- Na, na, na, na, na.

01:09:48.706 --> 01:09:49.662
I'm right here.

01:09:49.794 --> 01:09:51.839
[body thudding]

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:53.928
[upbeat music]

01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:56.757
[motors rumbling]

01:10:00.892 --> 01:10:02.546
- [Both] Let's do this.

01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:05.201
[upbeat music]

01:10:07.725 --> 01:10:12.469

01:11:18.404 --> 01:11:19.057
let's get the stuff
and get out of here.

01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:19.971
- [Thug] Put the mask on.

01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:21.015

01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:52.133

01:11:54.266 --> 01:11:55.311

The authorities
showed up quickly.

01:12:10.282 --> 01:12:11.762
Things started moving fast after

01:12:11.892 --> 01:12:13.154
the police took
those pinheads away.

01:12:13.285 --> 01:12:15.766
[upbeat music]

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.464
Turns out they were working for

01:12:18.595 --> 01:12:20.640
a slimy lawyer with
government credentials.

01:12:20.771 --> 01:12:22.338
He was trying to
make a quick buck

01:12:22.468 --> 01:12:25.906
selling satellite schematics
to some shady foreign types.

01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:27.865
- Look, they had the schematics

01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:29.475
on them when they
were picked up.

01:12:29.606 --> 01:12:31.869
Mental giants, didn't
want to take this job.

01:12:34.175 --> 01:12:34.872
Is that a threat?

01:12:37.048 --> 01:12:38.876
Yeah, I don't like your
tone of your voice.

01:12:40.312 --> 01:12:42.314
What do you mean you
know where my family is?

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.361
You don't even know
where you wife is.

01:12:46.753 --> 01:12:47.754
- [Axel] Oddly he
disappeared and he was

01:12:47.885 --> 01:12:50.017
never seen or heard from again.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.544
But the plot was
foiled, and actually

01:12:54.674 --> 01:12:55.675
it was a pretty big deal.

01:12:57.329 --> 01:12:59.853
Meanwhile, as you
may have guessed,

01:12:59.984 --> 01:13:02.203
the girls went on
to win the finals.

01:13:02.334 --> 01:13:03.944
Big celebration.

01:13:05.946 --> 01:13:08.079
But, that was just
the beginning.

01:13:09.776 --> 01:13:11.430
When news of what
happened got out,

01:13:11.561 --> 01:13:13.998
and with an election coming up,

01:13:14.128 --> 01:13:17.131
the mayor and the local
politicos all joined in.

01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:22.920
We all become well I'll
just say it, celebrities.

01:13:24.748 --> 01:13:29.187
And Ms. Pamela and Ms.
Andrea, were awarded

01:13:29.317 --> 01:13:32.190
scholarships, went
to NYU and then

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.410
were recruited into Homeland
Security right away.

01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:39.110
Ms. Michelle, followed her
dream and used her scholarship

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.506
to become a successful
veterinarian up
in Santa Barbara.

01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:46.465
She's a top dog in the state's
animal rights campaign.

01:13:48.293 --> 01:13:52.079
The Yugoslavian chick, well
she went back to Yugoslavia.

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:54.778
From what she said I guess it's
down right beautiful there.

01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.737
When there's not war going on.

01:13:58.825 --> 01:14:01.306
I think it's called Bosnia now.

01:14:04.091 --> 01:14:08.748
And me, my vast experience
and expertise in construction

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:12.448
and my national leadership
abilities really paid off,

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.451
and I started moving
up in the world.

01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:17.714
Axel Johnson's Guide To Fixin'
And Flippin' Real Estate

01:14:17.844 --> 01:14:20.281
has become somewhat
of a hit TV show,

01:14:20.412 --> 01:14:22.022
which can be seen
every night on cable.

01:14:32.772 --> 01:14:34.948
The house is no longer there.

01:14:36.297 --> 01:14:38.212
But my student turned a profit.

01:14:40.258 --> 01:14:41.041

and let me paint you a picture.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.952

and lounge and ballroom,
just off state route 69.

01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:36.096
I love that place.

01:15:36.227 --> 01:15:38.185
Free box lunch included.

01:15:38.316 --> 01:15:39.012

01:15:40.274 --> 01:15:43.800
And learn my unique system in

or one house a week, let me

and I'll even tell you how
long it will take it to flip.

01:16:06.213 --> 01:16:07.388

assist you in getting

Before we separated
ways, Homeland Security

01:18:22.045 --> 01:18:24.264
brought us in on a
couple of investigations.

01:18:24.395 --> 01:18:26.440
They thought our
talents could be of use.

01:18:28.268 --> 01:18:31.097
Sort of a modern day
Charlie's Angels.

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:36.842
You have a couple of hours, grab

01:18:36.973 --> 01:18:38.844
a glass of your
favorite beverage.

01:18:38.975 --> 01:18:40.933
You should already
have your shoes off.

01:18:41.064 --> 01:18:43.501
And cozy up, you're
in for a treat.

01:18:48.985 --> 01:18:51.639
This was a weird case.

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.904
There's no motive, no weapon,

01:18:55.034 --> 01:18:57.820
no witnesses,
except for the dog.

01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:01.388
When the police
finally arrived, they

01:19:01.519 --> 01:19:03.826
just tried to knock
the door down.

01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:05.392
That's when I
started to thinking,

01:19:06.567 --> 01:19:07.655
perfect job for the girls.

01:19:09.092 --> 01:19:11.877
Ms. Michelle hit the
roof, squeezed through

01:19:12.008 --> 01:19:15.489
a 12 inch pipe for the
AC, I have no idea how.

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:20.320
Don't care, Ms. Andrea,
hit the tunnels.

01:19:21.844 --> 01:19:23.628
Came up from underneath
the building.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:26.065
Ms. Pamela repelled
down the side,

01:19:26.196 --> 01:19:30.243
cut a hole in the
glass and that's that.

01:19:30.374 --> 01:19:33.203
What no one realized this
entire time was there's

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:36.162
a dog tied to the bike
rack 15 feet from the door.

01:19:36.293 --> 01:19:40.819
So, I called the best pet
psychic detective in the state.

01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:43.953
Took about 15 minutes to
get there from helicopter.

01:19:44.083 --> 01:19:46.303
That give the girls just
plenty of time to get in place.

01:19:46.433 --> 01:19:49.393
When she arrived, took
her about a minute or two

01:19:49.523 --> 01:19:52.352
to squeeze that information
out of the chihuahua.

01:19:52.483 --> 01:19:55.094
A slight communication barrier
'cause it only spoke Spanish.

01:19:55.225 --> 01:19:59.490
But once we got the information
the girls were ready.

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:04.147
Broke into the building
and rescued the hostage.
