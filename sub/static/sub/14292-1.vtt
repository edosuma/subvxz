03:02.558 --> 03:05.728
Come on, Cassey, another
straight after hours.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.229
You've been on your feet
whole day!

03:07.229 --> 03:09.815
No, thanks Joey.
I've got a day job too.

03:10.024 --> 03:12.943
-Are you sure I can't give you a lift?
-I'd rather face the muggers.

04:16.319 --> 04:19.963
Come on! Gimme your
money! Sweetheart!

04:28.936 --> 04:30.813
I worked whole for these tips,
and I don't leave it.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.732
Officer!

05:59.318 --> 06:00.569
Officer!

06:05.657 --> 06:06.825
Officer!

06:09.203 --> 06:10.537
Officer!

06:11.622 --> 06:13.874
Officer! Thank God its you!

06:14.958 --> 06:15.959
Two puerto rican guys...

06:16.168 --> 06:17.586
just trying to mug me....

06:54.665 --> 06:56.959
I swear to god!
It was a cop with a knife.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.961
It was a cop, a big cop.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.283
I hate the smell
of these places.

07:29.491 --> 07:30.576
Good morning.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.287
So...

07:33.495 --> 07:35.205
Well, We have a C-2...

07:35.414 --> 07:37.708
C-3 fracture dislocation...

07:37.916 --> 07:41.879
The head was unstable and there
was a desolvation injury...

07:42.087 --> 07:43.547
The residual hanging...

07:43.755 --> 07:45.799
...where the head just "popped"

07:46.091 --> 07:47.676
That's not what is interesting.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.179
What's interesting is we
also have a crushed larynx.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.849
The head's just flopping.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.438
You're tryin' to tell
me two kids did this?

08:00.439 --> 08:04.401
I just got a statement from an eyewitness
said he saw the kids attack her.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.904
Can't you cover her face?

08:07.571 --> 08:09.489
Her name's
Cassey Philips

08:10.490 --> 08:13.493
I used to go in her place for a nightcap.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.204
She always have latest jokes,
nice sense of humor.

08:17.827 --> 08:19.304
I always told her she ought to...

08:19.304 --> 08:21.099
... audition for one of those comedy joints.

08:21.099 --> 08:24.713
All the more reason I was thinking
was these bastards put away.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.800
Don't pass out on me Lovejoy.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.053
Take a look at the size...

08:31.261 --> 08:32.804
of those hematomas.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.307
You think I don't want those two
kids could have done that?

08:35.807 --> 08:37.476
Shit, you really think that
a cop did this?

08:37.683 --> 08:40.687
Why not? She knew me,
she knew a lot of cops.

08:41.980 --> 08:45.317
What's the use?  Let's go.
I think I need some fresh air.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.905
You must've been so
afraid Cassey...

08:52.574 --> 08:54.451
... And you saw a cop.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.718
So we just about closed that club. .

09:14.103 --> 09:15.296
You're not kidding.

09:15.804 --> 09:17.346
Sam, wath the lights!

09:27.818 --> 09:30.946
What's the matter with this thing?
Its quite broken or something.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.031
Relax.

09:33.657 --> 09:34.408
What's the hurry?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.918
Oh, shit, its a cop. Ditch that beer.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.337
- Where did he come from?
- I don't know, I don't know.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.553
Alright, what seems to be
the trouble, officer?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.974
Oh no, I think he wants you
to go with him!

09:59.607 --> 10:00.165
What for?

10:00.165 --> 10:02.062
I don't know. You just better
cooperate, alright?

10:12.404 --> 10:15.323
I can't stand any more tickets.
My insurance will go up.

10:58.834 --> 10:59.515
Yeah.

10:59.515 --> 11:02.412
Commissioner. Detective Lt.
Mc Crae is here to see you.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.664
Send him in.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.298
Have a seat, Lieutenant.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.346
Lieutenant, I've been going
over your report.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.183
Seems you automatically assume ,

11:23.391 --> 11:25.810
that it was a police officer,
instead of some ...

11:26.019 --> 11:28.229
lunatic son of a bitch dressed
up like a cop.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.857
He didn't kill the girl.
He wanted a witness.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.484
Oh, there you are.

11:32.943 --> 11:36.237
Obviously, someone tried
to discredit the police force.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.823
I mean if its my profile
for not to be a cop.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.451
All the same I think, we have to take a
look at around people.

11:41.910 --> 11:45.872
I'd like to have police psychologist give a
rundown on cops who've been under...

11:46.081 --> 11:49.250
mental disturbance,
attempted suicide,

11:49.459 --> 11:51.419
under extreme emotional stress.

11:52.068 --> 11:55.624
Sure, why don't we just test the
whole damn force while you're at it?

11:55.882 --> 11:58.478
Otherwise, We're looking for a
white man well over six feet tall,

11:58.478 --> 12:00.828
wears a police uniform,
doesn't have an alibi.

12:00.828 --> 12:03.281
I don't know where to start to
look, Commissioner!

12:06.768 --> 12:10.271
Listen, I want you to keep this
within the department. Keep it quiet.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.398
As long as we can...

12:11.981 --> 12:14.109
but he will kill again,
he enjoys killing.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.946
You know Lieutenant, You seem to
know a hell of a lot about this guy.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.532
Tell me something, when was the
last time you had a mental test?

12:22.409 --> 12:23.910
Anytime, Commissioner.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.497
As a matter of fact, didn't you try to
shoot yourself a couple of years back?

12:30.333 --> 12:31.668
The gun went off.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.963
The gun went off.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.800
Exactly, ten days after your
partner was killed in the line of duty ...

12:39.342 --> 12:41.136
your gun just happens to ...

12:41.344 --> 12:43.388
discharge all by itself.

12:45.172 --> 12:46.847
You've been even killed in every
sense,

12:46.847 --> 12:47.910
Even now,

12:49.319 --> 12:51.937
You don't smile very much.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.407
Hey! What you!

13:44.616 --> 13:45.867
This is my car!

13:52.707 --> 13:54.459
Help! please help!

13:54.959 --> 13:56.127
Help!

13:57.712 --> 13:59.172
Help me!

14:08.056 --> 14:08.890
Help!

14:15.438 --> 14:17.148
Please! Help me! Please!

14:17.357 --> 14:19.651
This is not funny! Stop it!

14:20.151 --> 14:22.362
Help me!

15:27.764 --> 15:29.808
I'm so suprised
when you called.

15:30.225 --> 15:32.769
I didn't think we will see
each other again.

15:32.977 --> 15:35.188
I see you on the news,
in the end of each night.

15:35.438 --> 15:37.315
Just before I shut off the lights.

15:37.524 --> 15:39.192
How romantic.

15:39.609 --> 15:42.070
Gina, this is'nt about romance.

15:43.071 --> 15:44.155
about murder.

15:51.079 --> 15:52.580
People have to be warned.

15:53.265 --> 15:56.388
Most people, they respect the uniform.
They do anything the cop tells them,

15:56.601 --> 15:58.374
Including take a walk up a dark alley.

15:58.878 --> 16:01.005
Who is he killing?
Pushers? Hustlers?

16:01.422 --> 16:02.841
Innocent people.

16:03.424 --> 16:05.802
Jesus! Maniac cop?

16:06.010 --> 16:07.720
How's that for a tag?

16:07.720 --> 16:10.985
I knew I could count on you
to sensationalizing the best way.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.048
Now you got to make it bigger than AIDS.

16:14.048 --> 16:16.064
Its the only way to city hall
off their ass.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.107
You're ready to go
on the line on this?

16:19.732 --> 16:21.442
Be quoted directly?

16:23.027 --> 16:25.530
I'm ready to hand you an
exclusive on this...

16:26.425 --> 16:29.244
... But I want you break it on the
late news show tonight.

16:30.326 --> 16:34.622
Okay, I'll need a backup on every detail,
names of witnesses, specifics from...

16:35.748 --> 16:38.126
Find everything you
need right there.

16:39.043 --> 16:41.087
Mc Crea, remember ...

16:42.005 --> 16:43.172
I owe you one.

16:43.381 --> 16:45.842
You don't owe me anything.

16:49.058 --> 16:52.790
This report was  informed by the source
within the New York Police department...

16:52.790 --> 16:54.820
... of attempts by the Homicide Division...

16:54.820 --> 16:57.629
to suppress facts regarding three recent homicides.

16:58.222 --> 17:03.508
Facts and witnesses to these murders point
unmistakably to a uniformed police officer.

17:04.444 --> 17:08.037
I repeat, a uniformed New York cop
has been seen in the commission...

17:08.037 --> 17:11.391
of these brutal killings occuring on
the streets of the city after dark.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.200
The question this station wants answered,

17:14.492 --> 17:16.786
why has Commissioner Pike
withheld these facts,

17:16.994 --> 17:19.038
and does the Mayor know what
is going on in his city?

17:19.741 --> 17:22.448
How can the public defend themselves
if they're unaware...

17:22.448 --> 17:25.576
...that one of New York's finest may
indeed be a psychopath...

17:25.576 --> 17:28.262
whose intent is to kill them
rather than protect them?

17:28.939 --> 17:32.109
Tomorrow on the morning show,
we will have an interview with...

17:32.109 --> 17:35.966
...Detective Lt. Frank Mc Crae McCrae who
is in charge of the investigation.

17:36.344 --> 17:38.904
was ordered not to speak to the press.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.430
You're not gonna get me!

18:31.319 --> 18:34.197
Anybody who wants to shoot a cop these
days has got a helluva excuse.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.448
Can you believe that?

18:35.656 --> 18:37.867
She thought he was the
fucking the maniac.

18:38.075 --> 18:41.412
Look. We've received 700 letters
accusing individual police officers.

18:42.128 --> 18:43.532
Look Councillor,

18:43.532 --> 18:46.231
A cop gives you a parking ticket
so what you do naturally...

18:46.231 --> 18:48.511
...you write in a letter accusing
him of being the killer. Right?

18:49.288 --> 18:52.022
Shit! Why does that have to happen
4 weeks before of my retirement?

18:52.457 --> 18:55.808
We're all in trouble, Captain.
Tourism's off by 38 percent.

18:55.808 --> 18:59.855
This nut must be quite, he is costing the
taxpayers bringings every day.

18:59.855 --> 19:03.518
Ripley, If you can't handle this, put in
for early retirement and step down.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.022
No way, Councillor.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.817
I want to nail this bastard.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.736
Pretty sharp.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.364
He'll be one step ahead of me.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.158
If I stake out
Tribecca and Soho,

19:19.784 --> 19:21.494
he strikes the east side.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.331
He may be getting information
from inside the department.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.960
That means he is one of us.

20:05.352 --> 20:07.589
I didn't know you were
on duty tonight.

20:07.589 --> 20:11.153
Yeah, With all the flu going around,
they had to put a lot of us on overtime.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.756
Always at night.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.218
It worries me when you
work so much at night.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.929
Worries me too.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.434
You don't talk about it much.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.647
When I come home,
i wanna forget.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.527
But it makes me
feel left out, Jack.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.029
You used to talk to me.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.074
Look, You're the one who
dropped out of the therapy.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.785
I was willing to go. I was
willing to pay the bills.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.288
So it's all my fault now. Is it?

20:49.415 --> 20:52.668
I did everything to hold
this marriage together.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.629
You talk like it's already over.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.132
It's not enough to talk,
you have to listen too.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.905
I suppose that's why you've
been taking all this overtime.

21:00.905 --> 21:02.212
To get away from me.

21:03.319 --> 21:05.461
- Or is it something else?
- What is that supposed to mean?

21:07.538 --> 21:08.607
Sometimes you wake up...

21:09.059 --> 21:11.270
... screaming, like you can't breath.

21:11.562 --> 21:14.481
Sometimes i get afraid that you
might hurt me in your sleep.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.195
Have I ever hurt you?

21:20.404 --> 21:22.907
I know it's wrong to be afraid
of my own husband but I...

21:23.115 --> 21:25.618
Now, why could't you say that
to the therapist?

21:26.076 --> 21:29.038
Why couldn't you simply say, I'm
afraid of him and I don't know why.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.165
Don't Jack, please!

21:31.165 --> 21:32.875
Don't go out tonight.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.460
Stay with me.

21:35.002 --> 21:38.005
Now, how can I?
I'm on the duty roster.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.300
I'll make it up to you on the weekend.
We'll go for ride in the country.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.968
We gonna go up to Tarrytown...

21:43.385 --> 21:46.472
Hey, Don't pull away from me.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.474
I'm sorry.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.186
I don't know what's
happening to me. I...

21:52.853 --> 21:55.564
...I don't like being
alone till all hours

21:56.315 --> 21:57.900
I hear things.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.069
I think I hear things.

22:00.069 --> 22:03.159
Look, There's enough locks
on the doors, you've  got a gun

22:03.159 --> 22:04.485
and you know how to use it.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.869
Let me fix that for you.

22:08.428 --> 22:12.719
Look, If I get out early tonight,
I'll try not to wake you.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.042
You can wake me up.

22:15.334 --> 22:19.338
Maybe I'm sleeping too much. They say
that could be depressing to a person.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.840
You know too much sleep.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.261
Be careful now.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.809
You say that every night.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.917
He went out again, didn't he?

22:57.501 --> 22:58.752
Who is this?

22:59.044 --> 23:01.380
Why do you keep calling me?

23:02.089 --> 23:04.508
Why does Jack keep killing people?

23:04.717 --> 23:06.510
He going to do it again tonight?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.846
Why you keep doing this to me?

23:18.021 --> 23:19.732
-Hey Jack?
-Hey Benny.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.407
Its not a big deal. I'll fix it.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.909
No, I'll fix it myself.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.781
Why did follow me?

25:34.408 --> 25:35.242
I thought ...

25:38.537 --> 25:40.414
I was afraid you were...

25:43.583 --> 25:44.418
God.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.754
I didn't want you to
find out this way.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.590
I wanted to tell you but
I didn't know how.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.634
Just...don't come near me.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.803
You have every right to
hate us both,

25:55.262 --> 25:57.139
but let me just try an explan....

25:57.431 --> 25:58.890
I don't want to hear another word.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.478
You say anymore...

26:04.521 --> 26:06.106
... I'll be killing you both.

26:06.773 --> 26:09.693
Ellen, don't point that thing.

26:10.671 --> 26:14.344
- Just drop that thing.
- Let her go.

26:14.740 --> 26:15.991
Let her go.

26:28.214 --> 26:31.000
Oh, Jesus.

27:11.922 --> 27:14.216
You folks checked out yet?

27:20.847 --> 27:23.266
You must've partied
up good in here.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.068
Let's see what other
damage done.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.642
Forrest.

28:06.226 --> 28:09.312
- Let's talk.
- Yeah, sure Captain.

28:19.864 --> 28:24.244
So you decided where you settle
down after your retire, you...

28:24.911 --> 28:26.496
...still think about florida?

28:29.082 --> 28:31.042
It's about your wife.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.337
She called you and complain
about our trouble.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.923
I thought she'd be going to
a lawyer or something like that.

28:37.674 --> 28:40.260
So you two haven't
been getting along.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.053
Ripley.

28:43.476 --> 28:44.663
Captain Ripley!

28:44.946 --> 28:48.775
Captain, since when is my personal
life any of your business?

28:50.042 --> 28:52.509
Since your wife was
found dead in a motel room.

28:54.607 --> 28:57.610
In a sleazebag Motor Inn
on Eleventh Avenue,

28:58.778 --> 29:02.407
With her throat slit
from ear to ear.

29:04.413 --> 29:07.560
No. You gotta be wrong.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.375
You want to see
some pretty pictures?

29:15.295 --> 29:18.089
She ran out, I thought
she might back home.

29:18.798 --> 29:19.966
You admit you were there?

29:21.801 --> 29:24.971
I tried to stop her but
she had a gun.

29:24.971 --> 29:29.191
Patrolman Forrest,
before you say anything else...

29:30.848 --> 29:32.442
...I better read you your rights.

29:42.430 --> 29:43.806
You saving your reviews?

29:45.335 --> 29:46.920
Never saw these before.

29:47.587 --> 29:48.588
What about this?

29:49.297 --> 29:50.382
Your wife's diary.

29:51.049 --> 29:52.384
She wrote ...

29:54.261 --> 29:58.848
"I now believe my husband
may be doing these murders."

29:59.057 --> 30:00.225
Is that why she followed you?

30:00.767 --> 30:02.894
-Is that why you shut her up?
-This is not true.

30:03.144 --> 30:05.855
Have you got an alibi for last Wednesday
night and the preceding Friday?

30:06.064 --> 30:07.607
-I was home.
-Come on Forrest.

30:08.066 --> 30:10.819
If you were home, your wife
wouldn't have suspected you.

30:11.403 --> 30:13.613
Alright, I was seeing somebody.

30:13.905 --> 30:16.366
I'll talk to my client now, alone.

30:16.783 --> 30:20.120
Councillor, We've read
him his Mirandas...

30:20.328 --> 30:22.747
...and he elected to
make a statement.

30:22.998 --> 30:24.624
That's inadmissible!

30:24.833 --> 30:28.795
He did admit that he was in that motel
room with presence of the victim.

30:29.004 --> 30:30.296
And that's enough.

30:30.505 --> 30:32.132
Now you two guys, outta here.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.760
Must remove now, Councillor.

30:38.596 --> 30:39.681
Councillor,

30:39.889 --> 30:41.933
We intend to have this suspect,

30:42.142 --> 30:44.978
appear in a lineup for the witnesses,
first thing tomorrow morning.

30:46.062 --> 30:47.564
Good day Sir.

30:53.306 --> 30:55.362
These guys are trying to make
me the fall guy.

30:55.362 --> 30:57.451
Everybody's screaming for
blood I was and I'm it.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.960
I'm certain you had no
control over what happened.

31:01.490 --> 31:06.612
Call it irresistible impulse.
That's a legal defense.

31:06.833 --> 31:10.170
Better yet, bet you don't even
remember committing the crimes,

31:10.378 --> 31:12.839
Blackouts, Momentary
lapses of memory.

31:13.089 --> 31:14.966
What are you talking about?
I'm not crazy. I didn't do it.

31:15.175 --> 31:16.760
You were seeing a
therapist on a regular basis.

31:16.968 --> 31:19.095
Come on, a marriage counselor.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.726
I've got a witness. Okay,
Somebody else who was there.

31:24.934 --> 31:27.353
I don't want to bring her into this
unless there's no other way.

31:27.704 --> 31:30.112
Pal! You need all
the help you can get.

31:31.399 --> 31:32.984
Its gonna ruin her career.

31:33.193 --> 31:36.654
Let's give it till the end of the week.
If they don't find the real killer by then,

31:37.405 --> 31:38.907
I'll name her.

31:42.379 --> 31:44.477
Yeah, so I told my kids,

31:44.770 --> 31:50.559
You see a cop, you cross to the other
side of the street. I see a cop, I'm outta here.

31:50.559 --> 31:52.959
a policeman crossed the street
to the other side.

31:52.959 --> 31:53.713
I seen there my friends
murdered by cops.

31:53.922 --> 31:56.674
Shot in the back. Shot when
they didn't have a gun or knife.

31:59.636 --> 32:02.722
You know, cops like killing,
that's why they're cops.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.016
Who's gonna be next, huh?

32:05.225 --> 32:09.604
Cops want you to be scared of them.
That makes them men, real men.

32:09.812 --> 32:14.359
Because without that uniform
what are they? I don't scare.

32:14.359 --> 32:18.571
They respected cops in my day or they
hit you on your head with their billy.

32:18.780 --> 32:21.491
They didn't take no guff.
They were the law.

32:22.158 --> 32:24.911
Nowadays like this, they got
to shoot you to get respect.

32:25.119 --> 32:26.496
Nobody gives no crap

32:26.704 --> 32:29.499
to the cops, no more since this
crazy cop come along.

32:29.707 --> 32:32.126
You see a cop coming now,
you get out of the way!

32:32.335 --> 32:33.753
And there ain't much
crime no more.

32:33.962 --> 32:35.588
Hey, Listen...

32:35.797 --> 32:38.883
But 18 years back I had a case for ya,

32:39.092 --> 32:42.345
This guy made it look as if
a psychopath was at work.

32:43.526 --> 32:44.909
So what does he do then?

32:45.659 --> 32:49.969
He goes in, He kills his wife and it
looks like its one of the serial killings.

32:50.228 --> 32:52.647
Jack, but set up to take
the heat off the real psycho.

32:55.191 --> 32:57.235
You gonna tell me you think
that he's that smart.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.529
He's a cop. Maybe even a Detective.

33:00.655 --> 33:03.741
-Fuck you!
-Come on Ripley, why not?

33:03.950 --> 33:07.078
Every Detective keeps his own uniform hanging in the closets and

33:07.287 --> 33:08.788
thats the one thing
you never could get rid off.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.601
Let me tell you if....

33:12.508 --> 33:14.290
If Jack had an alibi,

33:15.782 --> 33:17.324
he would have come
across with it by know.

33:17.755 --> 33:19.882
Jack is protecting someone.

33:20.091 --> 33:21.718
Whoever it is, he doesn't
want to be get involved.

33:22.385 --> 33:24.220
and the killer knows who it is.

33:24.721 --> 33:26.431
And you're a cop.

33:26.778 --> 33:28.711
-Fuckin I'm a cop.
What the fuck are you?

33:28.711 --> 33:29.731
Fuck you.

33:42.530 --> 33:44.824
-You put you in danger
-How?

33:46.451 --> 33:48.578
The scum wants to
lay low for a while,

33:48.953 --> 33:51.330
till he starts
another killing spree.

33:51.581 --> 33:53.583
He likes us to relax our guard.

33:53.791 --> 33:56.836
And he accomplishes that he
hands us a prime suspect.

33:57.156 --> 33:58.079
Why would he pick me?

33:58.079 --> 34:01.432
Your size, your description,
your personal file.

34:01.432 --> 34:03.899
He's getting his information from
inside the department.

34:05.303 --> 34:08.014
-And, of course, your sex life.
-John, but nobody knew about that.

34:09.474 --> 34:11.266
Your girlfriend might've
told somebody, Jack.

34:11.684 --> 34:15.438
She's the only one that can give us
the connection and that puts her in danger.

34:16.147 --> 34:17.440
John, She can take care herself.

34:17.899 --> 34:20.568
She outshoots me every time
we go to the range.

34:20.777 --> 34:21.777
She's on the force?

34:22.320 --> 34:23.862
You know her.

34:24.864 --> 34:25.989
Theresa Mallory.

34:28.427 --> 34:29.766
Congratulations!

34:30.827 --> 34:32.400
Its a well kept secret.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.063
Not well enough according to you.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.199
Where do I find?

34:35.792 --> 34:37.418
She is on duty tonight.

34:49.972 --> 34:51.849
How're you doing beautiful?

34:53.351 --> 34:54.351
Well, it depends.

34:55.268 --> 34:57.313
Would you like a lift someplace?

34:58.898 --> 35:01.025
Oh, I'm pretty much at
roam right here.

35:01.943 --> 35:04.946
Could I interest you
in something else?

35:06.572 --> 35:08.699
Want to be a little
more specific?

35:10.535 --> 35:12.662
You wouldn't be a cop?

35:13.412 --> 35:16.499
You got it, mister. You asked
the jackpot question.

35:16.972 --> 35:20.731
Now, why don't you run along home to
your wife and kids, like a good little boy?

35:21.185 --> 35:22.915
Yeah, that's just what I was gonna do.

35:23.231 --> 35:25.010
But I'll be thinking of you, baby.

35:26.310 --> 35:27.463
Can't arrest you for that.

35:27.837 --> 35:29.397
Ciao, baby.

36:05.439 --> 36:06.190
Who is it?

36:10.402 --> 36:11.570
Are you Malone?

36:27.503 --> 36:28.879
Hey McCrae.

36:31.006 --> 36:33.384
Don't get the wrong idea.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.135
I'm on duty here.

36:36.637 --> 36:39.306
Officer Mallory, 33rd Precinct.
Vice Squad

37:21.548 --> 37:23.967
It couldn't have just been
a bullet proof vest.

37:24.176 --> 37:27.763
I hit him in the head
atleast twice.

37:28.467 --> 37:29.474
Just bring me a tab,
will you?

37:29.474 --> 37:30.643
-Okay
-Thanks.

37:31.206 --> 37:33.392
Look at the marks
on your throat.

37:35.304 --> 37:39.244
I'm telling you Frank, his
hands were so big...

37:39.244 --> 37:42.190
they felt like ice,
even through his gloves.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.411
He wasn't breathing.

37:47.586 --> 37:50.922
Well, we won't put
that in our report. Huh?

37:51.127 --> 37:52.366
Why did you come looking for me?

37:52.793 --> 37:53.989
You were Jack's only witness.

37:54.684 --> 37:55.585
You had to disappear.

37:56.420 --> 37:57.554
He...

37:58.127 --> 37:59.621
He speak to you,
say anything?

38:00.460 --> 38:02.035
No, no not a sound.

38:02.624 --> 38:04.362
Last call,
want anything else?

38:04.577 --> 38:07.287
Yeah, one more round. Doubles.

38:08.567 --> 38:10.032
You're trying to get
me drunk.

38:10.032 --> 38:12.080
No, I'm just gonna stash
you away

38:12.080 --> 38:14.091
some place for few days
for safekeeping.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.570
Why can't I go home?

38:16.326 --> 38:18.261
Oh come on, If he knew where
you were assigned to work

38:18.261 --> 38:19.788
it's sure he almost know
where you live.

38:19.788 --> 38:20.927
How could he?

38:21.716 --> 38:23.175
You must have told
somebody at work.

38:23.753 --> 38:24.988
By a relationship?

38:25.344 --> 38:29.795
Come on, Jack was delibrately set up.
Somebody found his wife to follow him.

38:30.405 --> 38:31.807
Now, who did you tell?

38:32.972 --> 38:34.677
I guess you
know Sally Noland?

38:34.894 --> 38:36.250
Should I?

38:36.661 --> 38:40.577
Sure, She's been on the force for 20 years.
She's like a den mother to all of us.

38:41.237 --> 38:42.732
You know, she wears that leg brace.

38:42.732 --> 38:45.640
-Oh yeah, she uses a cane. Sure.
-Yeah that's her.

38:46.192 --> 38:47.202
Her father was a cop.

38:47.986 --> 38:49.534
I know, she's
fixtures down headquarters.

38:49.534 --> 38:51.516
She's been there so long,
you hardly notice her.

38:52.723 --> 38:53.724
What is this?

38:54.225 --> 38:57.353
The key to my apartment, 4E.
I want you to lock yourself in there.

38:57.693 --> 39:02.664
I'll call before I come back, So you know its me.
I'll ring twice, hang up, ring once again.

39:02.664 --> 39:04.674
Don't answer the phone
for anybody else.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.639
Wait, I thought you were going
to keep me company.

39:08.029 --> 39:10.131
I'll phone for a cab. I don't want
to get out to streets.

39:16.393 --> 39:18.796
I will stop down at headquarters.
I have a feeling, Miss Noland

39:18.796 --> 39:20.191
will be haunting the joint.

39:34.439 --> 39:35.908
Mc Crae, What did
you do in your hands?

39:36.222 --> 39:37.790
I cut myself shaving.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.522
Sign me in. Will you?

39:41.522 --> 39:43.441
Yes, Right.

40:36.645 --> 40:38.772
You came in a very bad time.
The computer is down.

40:40.566 --> 40:43.318
How do we ever please this
town without a computer, huh?

40:44.319 --> 40:46.447
The requested information...

40:47.072 --> 40:50.868
... You have to out this form and
I'll process it in the morning.

40:52.453 --> 40:52.995
You...

40:53.620 --> 40:55.247
...You have a pen?

40:59.398 --> 41:00.441
Thanks.

41:01.942 --> 41:04.945
We have a hard time writing this,
got little stitches in my...

41:05.555 --> 41:08.266
You know, we really should
know each other,

41:08.266 --> 41:10.696
were passing each other
in the halls for years.

41:12.203 --> 41:14.663
-Do have one friend in common.
-Who is that?

41:14.663 --> 41:15.688
Officer Mallory.

41:16.865 --> 41:17.957
Teresa.

41:18.533 --> 41:20.298
She had a close
call this evening.

41:20.948 --> 41:22.060
Why? What happened?

41:23.422 --> 41:26.509
She was working under cover vice.
Ran into a psycho,

41:26.509 --> 41:27.374
Its a mess.

41:29.236 --> 41:29.952
How is she?

41:30.514 --> 41:31.329
She is okay.

41:33.090 --> 41:35.334
Thank Jesus for that.

41:36.703 --> 41:37.899
She is a fine girl, that one.

41:39.087 --> 41:40.687
I knew you'd be relieved
if she is okay.

41:41.594 --> 41:42.841
Yeah, we should...

41:43.610 --> 41:46.787
We should all have us a beer together
sometime. Got to know each other.

41:46.787 --> 41:49.658
Sure. We'll all be inseperable

41:51.826 --> 41:52.785
How is that form?

41:53.202 --> 41:56.705
I'll tell you the truth,
its not very important. Forget it.

41:57.206 --> 41:58.707
Better get that computer fixed.

42:00.084 --> 42:01.961
I'm glad we finally got say hello.

45:31.545 --> 45:34.840
Don't do this, please.

45:35.299 --> 45:40.304
I know it would be safe if you put the
girl away but this way is even better.

45:40.990 --> 45:43.613
Now they think they got the
guilty man so that way...

45:43.613 --> 45:45.984
...they gonna let you guard down

45:45.984 --> 45:49.214
and you'll be free to get to the
mayor and the commissioner...

45:50.772 --> 45:51.982
...and put an end to this.

45:52.858 --> 45:55.777
I knew you had that anger
in you, Matt but...

45:56.320 --> 45:58.655
But I thought it would be
the dealers and the junkies

45:58.864 --> 46:02.826
and the human garbage
that you'd be cleaning the city of.

46:02.826 --> 46:05.906
Not all them poor people
just minding their business.

46:06.671 --> 46:09.701
What is it that got into you, Matt?
What's changed yourself?

46:09.701 --> 46:12.250
I said I'd stick by
you and I will.

46:13.356 --> 46:15.793
But you gotta stop
these killings.

46:16.757 --> 46:20.969
Just only save it for those
who did wrong to you.

46:29.102 --> 46:29.811
Who's out there?

46:31.271 --> 46:32.522
Answer me!

46:42.086 --> 46:44.894
Oh, guess i was
just jumping.

46:45.504 --> 46:46.512
Matt?

46:50.090 --> 46:51.336
Matt, where are you?

46:52.353 --> 46:54.581
I need you, Matt.
You need me.

46:56.867 --> 46:57.926
Come back ...

47:16.110 --> 47:17.294
Hey you?

47:17.650 --> 47:19.575
Oh, take it easy,
What you are doing?

47:20.153 --> 47:21.156
I had to take a leak.

47:21.467 --> 47:23.027
You always take a leak with
a gun in your hand?

47:23.027 --> 47:24.469
Its a good way to
blow your balls off!

47:28.906 --> 47:29.782
Oh.

47:31.915 --> 47:34.543
You scared me.
You're wearing a uniform.

47:34.543 --> 47:36.571
Yeah now everyones packing a gun
and I don't blame you

47:36.571 --> 47:38.175
should get hazard pay
with this uniform.

47:39.396 --> 47:40.346
Yeah.

47:41.982 --> 47:44.293
You got yourself killed back there
those timbers are ready to freak.

47:44.845 --> 47:47.029
This place is going to be demolished
in a couple of weeks.

47:47.230 --> 47:50.336
Yeah, the whole city'is going to hell,
you can't take a pee anywhere anymore.

48:02.779 --> 48:06.867
Here, more about Cordell
than you've time to read.

48:07.367 --> 48:08.869
He was my hero.

48:10.078 --> 48:14.624
Yes, Matt believed in an old saying:
Shoot first and ask questions later.

48:15.375 --> 48:18.795
He was kind though. Gentle
enough if you got to know him.

48:18.795 --> 48:19.946
Did you?

48:20.380 --> 48:24.092
I hate to admit it, but he used to like
come in here and look in his clippings,

48:24.301 --> 48:25.469
just like you're doing.

48:25.800 --> 48:27.532
He gotta like
being a celebrity.

48:28.547 --> 48:30.292
Real shame about what
happened to him.

48:31.469 --> 48:33.543
It was a crime what
the politicians did to him.

48:34.034 --> 48:37.573
Put him in Sing Sing with with all those
criminals he's been chasing all those years.

48:38.077 --> 48:39.388
It was like handing
him a death sentence.

48:40.650 --> 48:43.028
They say he violated
people's rights.

48:44.112 --> 48:45.655
You see even killers
got rights, huh?

48:46.281 --> 48:49.284
They murdered him,
those bastards at City Hall!

48:49.701 --> 48:52.078
He had no kids, no wife.

48:53.413 --> 48:56.833
I guess a one hundred percent cop like
him give no time for a personal life.

48:57.250 --> 48:58.919
Here Clance thanks,
you may put this away.

49:01.755 --> 49:02.964
You're wrong about that,

49:02.964 --> 49:04.758
He had himself
a real nice girl.

49:04.966 --> 49:07.385
I think he wanna go married if they
hadn't been for all that trouble.

49:07.594 --> 49:09.262
-You're sure he was?
-Sure.

49:09.471 --> 49:12.140
He brought her in one time
to show off for her.

49:12.641 --> 49:15.977
She wasn't much
to look at, but nice.

49:16.186 --> 49:17.812
And, of course a cop.

49:19.314 --> 49:20.941
She must have
taken it pretty hard.

49:20.941 --> 49:23.467
Worse than that.
Right after he was convicted,

49:23.841 --> 49:26.711
the poor soul threw herself out of a
window trying to kill herself.

49:26.992 --> 49:29.082
Terrible thing for a
Catholic girl to do.

49:29.942 --> 49:30.813
She crippled herself.

49:32.869 --> 49:33.870
Thanks Clance.

49:33.870 --> 49:36.381
Yeah, they don't make cops
like him anymore.

49:36.949 --> 49:37.926
He was one of the kind.

49:38.721 --> 49:40.463
-He is still is.
-What was that?

49:41.361 --> 49:42.929
Nothing. Forget it.

53:57.822 --> 54:00.283
Oh, we're interrogating the suspect
for about half an hour.

54:00.492 --> 54:02.702
Okay, Call me when you feel.

54:05.728 --> 54:07.105
We know who the killer is.

54:07.564 --> 54:10.150
-Did you tell the D.A?
-Yes, we tried you but he wouldn't believe us.

54:10.358 --> 54:11.609
You won't either.

54:11.818 --> 54:13.611
You ever hear about Detective Matt Cordell?

54:14.166 --> 54:16.379
Yes, before my time but
you know, he's a legend.

54:16.379 --> 54:18.627
Really trigger happy right?
He died in jail.

54:18.627 --> 54:20.763
I suppose he didn't.
Suppose he's back.

54:21.158 --> 54:22.851
Only now he kills innocent people.

54:23.414 --> 54:24.899
But how can he get
out of prison alive?

54:24.899 --> 54:27.666
We're gonna find out, tommorow
morning I've got an appointment with

54:27.666 --> 54:30.339
chief medical examiner
of sing sing, Doctor Gruber.

54:30.572 --> 54:32.037
Now why don't...

54:32.037 --> 54:35.302
...why you continue this
questioning for a while alone?

54:35.302 --> 54:36.761
Rough him up a little bit.

54:38.346 --> 54:39.388
Thanks.

54:42.099 --> 54:45.519
Officer Mallory will continue
the interrogation till I get back.

54:45.519 --> 54:46.348
Right.

55:37.613 --> 55:39.156
He knows, He knows.

55:41.784 --> 55:43.744
He knows. He knows you're here.

55:44.745 --> 55:47.039
He knows that
I'm no good to him anymore!

55:47.559 --> 55:49.838
He knows, He knows, He knows.

56:02.805 --> 56:05.391
He knows.
He knows...

56:25.418 --> 56:26.928
He is here!
He is here!

56:28.539 --> 56:29.915
Stop it!

56:30.124 --> 56:32.334
Lean on me. Come on,
walk this way, come on.

56:32.877 --> 56:37.715
I'm not afraid. But to have him kill
me when I still love him so much.

56:46.265 --> 56:47.808
Why doesn't anybody answer?

56:49.116 --> 56:50.325
Put her down, Cordell!

56:52.411 --> 56:53.328
Put her down!

56:55.539 --> 56:56.790
Son of a bitch!

57:13.724 --> 57:15.309
No, no, no, stay there.

57:18.478 --> 57:21.398
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Didn't you hear the buzzer?

57:22.065 --> 57:22.941
What, you deaf?

57:31.284 --> 57:32.577
What are you doing?

57:33.905 --> 57:35.565
I've got to get you out of this building.
Come on.

57:35.565 --> 57:38.023
What about you? If they see you
with that gun, you gonna get shot.

57:38.023 --> 57:39.182
Don't worry about me.

57:58.716 --> 58:00.465
We gotta to find Mc Crae.
How did you get here?

58:00.465 --> 58:03.296
With Mc Crae.
His car is still outside.

58:03.497 --> 58:06.834
Okay, here is the deal. Get in and wait.
If we're not out in five minutes,

58:06.834 --> 58:08.640
hot wire it, haul ass out of here.
You got it?

58:08.640 --> 58:09.670
-Got it.
-Okay go!

58:57.065 --> 58:59.969
Keep your hands where
I can see them. Back up against the wall.

58:59.969 --> 59:01.747
Hold on, I didn't do any of this.

59:01.747 --> 59:03.928
You broke out of your cell.
You killed them all.

59:03.928 --> 59:05.327
Wasn't me.
Was somebody else.

59:05.327 --> 59:06.015
Shut up!

59:06.337 --> 59:08.588
He's still here.
You're letting him get away.

59:08.804 --> 59:10.803
Nobody's getting away.
I'm calling for backups.

59:20.646 --> 59:21.999
-Don't even try.
-Ok, ok!

59:23.048 --> 59:23.760
Listen!

59:24.542 --> 59:26.430
-I didn't do any of this.
-Sure you didn't.

59:26.655 --> 59:27.595
Put your guns over there.

59:28.373 --> 59:30.089
Alright, on your face!
Both you!

59:31.615 --> 59:34.750
-We may've gone after him.
-You heard him, he didn't do it.

59:36.040 --> 59:38.001
Teresa, let's go.

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:10.098
Keeping McCrae's appointment
in sing sing.

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:13.476
Sure, walk into a prison what happens,
police force are out looking for you.

01:00:13.685 --> 01:00:16.896
-You're a brave man.
-No, not brave, scared shitless.

01:00:17.105 --> 01:00:20.441
Unless we can prove that in Cordell
is still alive, its gonna be my ass.

01:00:36.124 --> 01:00:37.834
Step over there, please.

01:00:50.889 --> 01:00:52.223
Your left.

01:01:00.471 --> 01:01:01.610
Yes, Can I help you?

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:04.907
Yeah, we better here in meeting with your
Doctor Grubber, We're a little early.

01:01:04.907 --> 01:01:05.762
You got a name?

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.837
Mc Crae, Detective Frank Mc Crae.

01:01:08.321 --> 01:01:10.836
Yeah, The Doctors office'
around back to your left.

01:01:10.836 --> 01:01:13.005
-Alright, thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:01:13.866 --> 01:01:15.367
You know Matt Cordell?

01:01:15.993 --> 01:01:17.745
Not many like that.

01:01:18.203 --> 01:01:19.997
I did the autopsy on him.

01:01:19.997 --> 01:01:22.911
Look, the authorities knew this
something like that could happen to him.

01:01:23.123 --> 01:01:24.382
Why didn't they prevent him?

01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:27.814
He wouldn't allow it.
He refused to be in isolation.

01:01:28.922 --> 01:01:30.174
Guess he...

01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:33.051
...don't want admit
that he was afraid.

01:01:33.263 --> 01:01:34.294
What do you do in a
case like that?

01:01:34.294 --> 01:01:35.450
What do you mean?

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:36.934
When they're all cut up like that?

01:01:37.213 --> 01:01:40.317
This is no ordinary
morticians home.

01:01:40.944 --> 01:01:43.884
We're not into a cosmetic
approaches here.

01:01:44.104 --> 01:01:46.482
When a prisoner dies,
it's not our job,

01:01:46.732 --> 01:01:49.109
to make him look good
again for his family.

01:01:49.318 --> 01:01:51.069
We just stitch up the parts.

01:01:51.737 --> 01:01:53.447
and put them into
a wooden box,

01:01:53.947 --> 01:01:55.157
and we bury him.

01:01:55.365 --> 01:01:56.867
Is that what happened to
Matt Cordell?

01:01:57.534 --> 01:01:59.369
I've look in my records.

01:01:59.661 --> 01:02:00.704
Would you mind?

01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:05.459
Most of them just go to
the potter's field.

01:02:09.803 --> 01:02:12.507
These are those records.

01:02:14.343 --> 01:02:17.179
-His body was claimed by a woman.
-May I see that?

01:02:18.764 --> 01:02:20.307
We both know Miss Noland.

01:02:21.141 --> 01:02:24.978
I think before this goes any further,
I'd like to see some identification

01:02:25.187 --> 01:02:28.190
Detective Mc Crae, something
with your photograph on it?

01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:32.194
Det. Lieutenant Mc Crae
died early this morning.

01:02:32.402 --> 01:02:33.612
He was murdered.

01:02:33.612 --> 01:02:36.083
Murdered by the same man
that killed over half a dozen people

01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:37.623
at police headquarters
last night.

01:02:38.367 --> 01:02:41.078
I haven't gotten to my
morning paper.

01:02:43.455 --> 01:02:44.831
No wonder you know
all the lurid details.

01:02:45.624 --> 01:02:46.917
If I had murdered a
bunch of officers,

01:02:47.167 --> 01:02:49.795
the last place I'd come
is the penitentiary.

01:02:50.587 --> 01:02:53.840
Don't bullshit us.
You know who did the killings.

01:02:54.591 --> 01:02:55.551
How could I know?

01:02:55.801 --> 01:02:57.928
Cordell, wasn't dead.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.948
And then you saved him.

01:04:00.615 --> 01:04:01.450
Answer me.

01:04:02.534 --> 01:04:04.745
Look, he was a fine Detective.

01:04:04.953 --> 01:04:06.997
He had a lot of friends.

01:04:07.656 --> 01:04:08.647
Everyone knew...

01:04:08.647 --> 01:04:10.884
...that if we put him back in the
prison community,

01:04:10.884 --> 01:04:13.049
they just attack him again.

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:14.921
There was no way
he could survive.

01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:17.966
So, when they brought him
up here, more dead than alive,

01:04:18.175 --> 01:04:20.802
this policewoman convinced
me to do the decent thing.

01:04:21.053 --> 01:04:24.306
Like remove him from prison
mortuary alive?

01:04:24.598 --> 01:04:26.808
He wasn't exactly alive,
There was severe brain damage.

01:04:27.017 --> 01:04:30.729
I'm certain he was legally dead.

01:04:31.396 --> 01:04:34.816
I was telling the truth when
I signed that death certificate.

01:04:35.192 --> 01:04:37.944
There's no way he could function
as a human being again.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.571
Read the newspaper, Doc.

01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:42.491
Get out of my office, Now!

01:04:48.038 --> 01:04:49.331
You never came here.

01:04:49.944 --> 01:04:52.271
I'm not going to pick up that phone.
This never happened.

01:04:52.271 --> 01:04:55.870
There's no end to your decency,
Is there Doctor?

01:04:57.005 --> 01:04:58.340
What did I do wrong?

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:01.802
You should have seen him on the
operating table, cut to pieces.

01:05:03.011 --> 01:05:04.763
I know the system
screwed him.

01:05:04.763 --> 01:05:07.912
The politicians, put him in prison
and the inmates did the rest.

01:05:07.912 --> 01:05:10.501
And now you're trying to ruin
my life and my career.

01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:12.434
We're not trying to
ruin anybody.

01:05:12.985 --> 01:05:16.893
We just want to bury Mat Cordell
once and for all.

01:05:19.387 --> 01:05:22.128
Get out of here.
Go away.

01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:25.659
Here Doctor, put this on.

01:05:25.867 --> 01:05:27.035
What are you talking about?

01:05:27.244 --> 01:05:28.578
You know it's
St. Patrick's Day?

01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:32.082
Hey, The Mayor and the Police
Commissioner will be there.

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:34.334
Yeah, along with five thousand cops.

01:05:34.709 --> 01:05:37.712
I bet Cordell has loved walking in that
parade every year he was on the force.

01:05:37.921 --> 01:05:40.590
Whatever he loved he hates now.

01:06:02.529 --> 01:06:05.782
And so this years St Patrick's Day
parade continues on schedule,

01:06:05.991 --> 01:06:08.743
despite speculation of the parade
may have been cancelled

01:06:08.952 --> 01:06:10.120
due to fear of violence.

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:13.790
Authorities report scores
of death threats against the police,

01:06:14.332 --> 01:06:16.751
plus threats of bombings
along the parade route.

01:06:17.752 --> 01:06:19.588
But this has not deterred
a record crowd for

01:06:19.796 --> 01:06:22.799
turning out for New York's
St Patrick's Day parade.

01:06:23.592 --> 01:06:24.469
What a parade it is.

01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:27.032
Public have rage on
the continued killings

01:06:27.032 --> 01:06:29.187
by the so called maniac cop,

01:06:29.187 --> 01:06:32.532
have brought many hostile New Yorkers
to New Yorks 5th avenue today.

01:06:33.237 --> 01:06:36.531
Police security forces and the special
bomb squads are on full force.

01:06:36.531 --> 01:06:39.659
As well as plaincloth detectives
were mixed into the crowd.

01:06:47.168 --> 01:06:49.341
I can't walk in. They're gonna
shoot me on sight.

01:06:49.341 --> 01:06:50.235
I'll do it.

01:06:50.235 --> 01:06:52.003
Alright, but you gonna get
through to the commissioner.

01:06:52.003 --> 01:06:55.136
I'm supposed to convince him these killings
are being committed by a dead man?

01:06:55.374 --> 01:06:58.034
Commissioner pike was Chief of Police
when Cordell was sent to jail.

01:06:58.311 --> 01:07:00.276
He's probably the one that
Cordell blames more than anybody else.

01:07:00.276 --> 01:07:02.293
-Where you gonna be?
-I'm gonna be right here.

01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:20.145
So he says, Commissioner said
that this is my wife.

01:07:27.945 --> 01:07:32.324
Look who's just walked in.
Jack Forrest's girlfriend.

01:07:34.034 --> 01:07:35.619
Come on, everybody outta here.

01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:42.773
Alright, so where is
that son of a bitch?

01:07:42.773 --> 01:07:46.462
He's willing to give himself up.
After you listen.

01:07:47.209 --> 01:07:48.448
So you're giving orders now.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.419
I know who committed these murders.

01:07:50.672 --> 01:07:52.318
So do we sweetheart,
its your boyfriend.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:54.820
You are wrong.
Its a man named Matt Cordell.

01:07:58.386 --> 01:07:59.053
A ghost.

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:01.478
Did you come up with this
lunatic idea up by yourself,

01:08:01.478 --> 01:08:02.496
or are you on drugs?

01:08:03.182 --> 01:08:04.642
It was Mc Crae's theory.

01:08:04.851 --> 01:08:06.853
But we verified it.

01:08:06.853 --> 01:08:09.266
Listen sweetheart, last night
before Mc Crae was murdered,

01:08:09.266 --> 01:08:11.192
he called my house,
I wasn't there

01:08:11.192 --> 01:08:13.482
I was at a charity event
but he was kind enough...

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:16.902
...to leave a message on my service.
Would you like to give a listen?

01:08:18.118 --> 01:08:21.984
This is Frank McCrae.
I've got solid evidence this,

01:08:21.984 --> 01:08:25.616
homicidal maniac is getting information
from inside the department.

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:28.892
His accomplice is a female employee.
A policewoman.

01:08:29.363 --> 01:08:31.365
I'll be at the Crime Records
Division, waiting.

01:08:31.604 --> 01:08:32.800
Call me when you get in.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.617
Ofcourse he couldn't have
been talking about you.

01:08:36.924 --> 01:08:39.426
A policewoman,
The killer's accomplice...

01:08:39.676 --> 01:08:41.554
He's talking
about Sally Noland.

01:08:42.975 --> 01:08:46.173
That's really great.
You accuse a dead woman,

01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:50.358
When the fact is, the log states
that you came to see

01:08:50.358 --> 01:08:52.890
Jack Forrest last night on
alleged police business.

01:08:54.274 --> 01:08:57.028
And that you aided in his
escape from that cell block.

01:08:57.654 --> 01:09:00.323
-You helped him kill all those people.
-That's a lie.

01:09:04.535 --> 01:09:08.747
Why are you doing this? You know
I'm telling the truth about Cordell.

01:09:10.263 --> 01:09:11.410
Enough for the shit,

01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:13.122
I've got a parade to attend.

01:09:13.122 --> 01:09:14.533
Thats alright.
You better go sir,

01:09:14.533 --> 01:09:16.385
you know everyone else is
left for the review extend.

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.930
No Wait, You may be in danger
if you go down there.

01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:22.559
Don't you understand? Cordell wants
to kill you and the Mayor.

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:23.678
That's what Forrest
told you to say?

01:09:23.997 --> 01:09:27.267
If you have any sense at all,
you won't go down there.

01:09:27.267 --> 01:09:30.194
Book her! Asses for the first
degree murder.

01:09:32.604 --> 01:09:35.316
Nice to hear Commissioner
avoiding reporters.

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:40.006
-Sit down there.
-What?

01:09:40.006 --> 01:09:41.176
Right here.

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:49.455
I understand that you were
going to book me.

01:09:49.944 --> 01:09:54.665
Well, what's the rush? I mean, We got
the commissioner's office all to ourselves.

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:58.758
We got a place in Newberg, you know
me and your lady...

01:09:58.758 --> 01:09:59.569
Not before you.

01:09:59.569 --> 01:10:00.943
Commissioner, the tie!

01:10:00.943 --> 01:10:02.355
Never mind the tie, come on.

01:10:08.474 --> 01:10:10.601
-Oh, we've to wait?.
-Hardly...

01:10:35.334 --> 01:10:38.337
Won't you put a a real feather in my
cap and lay it all out for me.

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:41.007
The reason behind those killings...

01:10:41.297 --> 01:10:42.416
...was extortion money,
wasn't it?

01:10:42.416 --> 01:10:44.614
Money had nothing to
do with those killings.

01:10:44.836 --> 01:10:46.631
It was an act of
vengeance against the city.

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.784
You know the truth is darling,
I could really use a collar like this one.

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:53.564
Come on, win me
the big promotion.

01:10:53.789 --> 01:10:54.612
Make me a hero.

01:10:55.088 --> 01:10:56.648
If you gonna put
me under arrest,

01:10:57.441 --> 01:10:58.564
I wanna
see my lawyer.

01:10:59.393 --> 01:11:01.362
You know, you got a
real rotten ass attitude.

01:11:01.654 --> 01:11:04.157
Fine let's go.
I'll take you downstairs.

01:11:13.372 --> 01:11:14.832
Dont give me
any trouble, huh?

01:11:15.041 --> 01:11:17.001
This is great,
I don't believe this.

01:11:17.209 --> 01:11:19.837
Everybody else has gone to
parade and I'm stuck here with you.

01:11:20.087 --> 01:11:21.589
This is fantastic.

01:11:21.838 --> 01:11:25.558
You with your great attitude, ruin makes
things nice. You know...

01:12:58.183 --> 01:12:58.892
Is that Forrest?

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.229
Let's get him!

01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:05.608
Hold right there!

01:13:06.911 --> 01:13:07.940
No.

01:13:13.073 --> 01:13:14.742
Listen to me,
He's up there!

01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:16.368
He is in Pike's office.

01:13:17.119 --> 01:13:20.622
Don't you go giving any orders! I ought
to put a bullet right between your eyes.

01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:21.707
...and I'll be a hero!

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:25.169
I'm the wrong guy!

01:13:25.377 --> 01:13:26.545
He's out there...

01:13:28.922 --> 01:13:31.759
Tell "His Honor" that this
"Maniac Cop" has been recaptured.

01:13:53.491 --> 01:13:54.895
Hurry up! You're wasting time.

01:13:54.895 --> 01:13:57.428
The killer's in that paddy wagon!
Come on, let's go!

01:14:19.028 --> 01:14:20.655
Do you know how to
handle a shotgun?

01:14:21.055 --> 01:14:22.626
You just get close
enough and watch me.

01:14:31.781 --> 01:14:33.901
Vehicle last seen heading
towards the river.

01:14:35.219 --> 01:14:37.517
The river? I think I know
where he's going.

01:14:37.741 --> 01:14:38.942
Yeah sure.

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:40.691
Now listen to me.
Do you know where Pier 14 is?

01:14:40.691 --> 01:14:42.973
Those piers are all closed.
They're collapsing.

01:14:43.494 --> 01:14:45.245
McCrae once tracked him to Pier 14.

01:16:13.839 --> 01:16:14.716
Hurry up!

01:18:00.565 --> 01:18:02.526
Hold on a sec!
I'll call for backup.

01:18:03.527 --> 01:18:07.906
This car 4604 requesting
a backup in pier 14. Right away!

01:18:32.889 --> 01:18:34.599
Let him go, Cordell!

01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:40.289
Theresa, get these
cuffs off.

01:18:49.156 --> 01:18:50.323
Hold it there!

01:22:20.172 --> 01:22:22.100
Easy on the
bottles, Jerry.
