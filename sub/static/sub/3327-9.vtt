00:06.700 --> 00:08.634
*

00:14.080 --> 00:16.469
(booming thunder echoes)

00:16.510 --> 00:18.046
You look worse.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.219
I think we should take
your temperature agaln.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.048
No need.
It just dropped one degree

00:23.090 --> 00:25.115
since we last checked.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.414
Well, that still
puts you at 101.

00:27.460 --> 00:30.088
(phone chimes)

00:31.460 --> 00:33.451
(teakettle whistling)

00:35.460 --> 00:38.099
Dead man found in an
abandoned building.

00:38.130 --> 00:39.836
Detective Bell has
extended an invitation.

00:39.870 --> 00:41.565
Tea will have to wait.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.101
This might be
a good time to remind you

00:43.140 --> 00:46.109
that the NYPD doesn't
actually pay you to consult.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.175
Watson, you should
know by now,

00:47.210 --> 00:48.507
boredom is far
more dangerous

00:48.540 --> 00:50.144
to my health
than any fever.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.247
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:58.250 --> 01:00.684
BELL:
You look awful.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.086
Well, at least I
still have my eyes.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.654
That makes
three of us.

01:04.690 --> 01:05.827
(thunder rumbles)

01:05.860 --> 01:08.294
BELL:
No wallet, no I.D.

01:08.330 --> 01:10.195
All we know is, male white,

01:10.230 --> 01:13.495
mid- to late-40s, and the shots
he took to the face,

01:13.540 --> 01:15.462
near-contact wounds.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.536
Thought you could take a look
before we wrap up the scene,

01:17.570 --> 01:20.505
but that was before
I knew you were dying.

01:20.540 --> 01:25.204
No shell casings,
no skull fragments,
no gray matter.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.377
He was killed elsewhere,
and then dumped here.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.183
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.847
A pig's orgasm lasts
up to 30 minutes.

01:30.890 --> 01:33.711
Hey, I'm not your mother,
I'm not your nurse,

01:33.760 --> 01:35.682
but if you die
of exposure out here,

01:35.720 --> 01:37.153
I'm pretty sure your father's
not gonna send me

01:37.190 --> 01:39.158
my next check, okay?

01:56.280 --> 01:58.202
(thunder rumbles)

02:06.520 --> 02:09.250
Comfortable shoes,
but not tennis shoes.

02:09.290 --> 02:11.224
He was on his feet all day,

02:11.260 --> 02:13.922
but he didn't have a job that
permitted casual footwear.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.428
You throw in the dry-erase
marker stains on his fingers

02:16.470 --> 02:17.926
and the laser pointer
in his breast pocket,

02:17.970 --> 02:19.892
I'd say that he was
a professor

02:19.940 --> 02:22.636
of East Asian Studies
who's been to Thailand

02:22.670 --> 02:24.831
in the last few weeks.

02:24.870 --> 02:27.202
Ratty cotton thread
on his wrist;

02:27.240 --> 02:28.832
it's a sai sin bracelet,

02:28.880 --> 02:30.404
attached to one's hand
when one enters

02:30.450 --> 02:32.577
a Thai Buddhist
monastery.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.941
Designed to unravel and
fall away over time.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.187
Judging by the wear
and tear on that one

02:37.220 --> 02:38.812
and assuming he kept a
regular shower schedule,

02:38.850 --> 02:41.182
I would say that he got it
approximately ten days ago.

02:41.220 --> 02:44.485
All right, I'll contact
the local universities.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.327
University-- singular.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.952
Garrison.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.319
Why Garrison?

02:49.370 --> 02:51.361
His tie,
yellow and blue,

02:51.400 --> 02:52.833
the latter is
a particular shade,

02:52.870 --> 02:55.338
Garrison Blue, school colors.

02:55.370 --> 02:57.964
All right,
I'll contact Garrison.

02:58.010 --> 03:02.242
Don't ask for Professor
Trent AnnunZIo.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.942
I'm afraid he's quite dead.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.404
WOMAN:
I met Trent five years ago.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.409
He was teaching in Beijing,
and I was his student.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.739
I moved here for him.
We married two years ago.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.247
Can you think
ofanyone

03:39.280 --> 03:40.611
who might've wished
your husband harm?

03:40.650 --> 03:44.416
He was a professor,
a normal person.

03:44.450 --> 03:46.281
(phone ringing)

03:50.030 --> 03:52.248
Excuse me.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.324
Hello.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.568
MAN:
Joanie, hey. It's me.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.261
Liam?

03:58.300 --> 04:00.268
I'm sorry.
I feel

04:00.300 --> 04:01.961
I'm not being very helpful.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.968
It's just,
Trent was a good man.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.807
No enemies.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.003
Actually, Mrs. Annunzio,
I find that hard to believe.

04:10.850 --> 04:14.877
He was... he was shot in one
eye, and then the other

04:14.920 --> 04:16.410
at extremely close range.

04:16.450 --> 04:18.589
That's visceral, personal.

04:18.620 --> 04:21.054
Not a natural way to kill.

04:21.090 --> 04:26.392
Not unless you bore a grudge
or were sending a message.

04:26.430 --> 04:27.920
A message?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.518
When was the last time
you saw him?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.367
Yesterday morning.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.369
He had several classes, then
a department meeting at night.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.731
There have been many of late.

04:35.770 --> 04:37.829
Any idea what
they were about?

04:37.870 --> 04:40.475
He never said.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.878
Watson, we feared
we'd lost you.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.775
We're off to Garrison
to speak wnth

04:47.820 --> 04:49.014
the dead man's colleagues.

04:49.050 --> 04:52.042
Is it okay if I peel off
for a little while?

04:52.090 --> 04:54.558
Off to Rikers?
My eyes may be red,

04:54.590 --> 04:57.058
but I can still read
your caller ID.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.785
What is he, a friend in trouble?

04:58.830 --> 05:00.024
An old client.

05:00.060 --> 05:02.494
Very well.
I'll keep you apprised

05:02.530 --> 05:04.361
as to our location
VIa text.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.867
Great.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.400
BELL: You were his teaching
assistant, correct?

05:10.440 --> 05:11.407
For the last four years.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.375
His wife told us he had
to work late last night.

05:14.410 --> 05:16.002
Something about
a department meeting.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.440
He left here after his last
class got out at 5:30.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.619
If there were a meeting,
I would've heard about it.

05:20.650 --> 05:22.515
Think maybe he lied
to his wife?

05:22.550 --> 05:24.541
Or she lied to us?

05:42.170 --> 05:44.104
Professor Annunzio was chair
of the department.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.472
May I assume
that he had his pick

05:46.510 --> 05:50.071
of the offices
on this floor?

05:52.480 --> 05:54.516
Hmm. It's interesting.

05:54.550 --> 05:57.144
I'll be out here
if you need anything.

05:57.190 --> 06:02.082
Sort of cramped for a
department chair, huh?

06:02.120 --> 06:04.429
Appointment book.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.599
Maybe it'll tell us what
he got up to last night.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.120
Unlikely he would
notate trips

06:08.160 --> 06:10.594
to an underground Chinese
gambling parlor.

06:10.630 --> 06:11.927
Excuse me?

06:11.970 --> 06:13.562
That's what he was
doing last night.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.830
I know you're
just waiting for me

06:15.870 --> 06:18.168
to ask you why
you think that.

06:18.210 --> 06:19.837
Why do you think that?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.906
I'm glad you asked.
It was the thirteens.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.999
His apartment was 13, his cell
phone number ends in 1313,

06:26.050 --> 06:27.915
and he chose this office,
number 13,

06:27.950 --> 06:30.487
when he could have had the
far brighter and more spacious

06:30.520 --> 06:32.408
office across
the way, number 14.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.610
Why? Because 14
is an unluclq number

06:34.660 --> 06:36.013
in Chinese gambling.

06:36.060 --> 06:37.982
13, quite the opposite.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.429
Annunzio spoke fluent Mandarin.

06:39.460 --> 06:41.451
Surely he could talk
his way into the mahjong

06:41.500 --> 06:43.195
or Pai Gow parlors in Chinatown.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.697
Maybe he's
a gambler.

06:44.730 --> 06:47.130
Doesn't_ mean _
he was gambling last nIght.

06:47.170 --> 06:50.628
Did you not notice
his underwear earlier?

06:50.670 --> 06:53.104
Bright red boxers, hmm?

06:53.140 --> 06:56.598
Customary for Chinese gamblers
to wear red for good luck.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.005
His clo_thes reeked
of Cigarettes,

06:59.050 --> 07:02.213
but his teeth were bright white,
not smoker-yellow.

07:02.250 --> 07:05.219
He was gambling, and he was
gambling in a smolq room.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.753
Starting to think
you're right.

07:07.790 --> 07:09.451
Mahjong tiles.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.194
Those are different sizes,
they're different colors.

07:13.230 --> 07:15.221
They're clearly
from different sets.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.796
Now, mahjong tiles
come in pairs.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.525
Why would he hold
onto one of each?

07:18.570 --> 07:21.596
Because these _tiles
aren't for playing.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.108
They're membership cards
to underground casinos.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.438
Aren't you gonna ask me
how I knew that?

07:28.210 --> 07:30.644
Fine. Whatever.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.910
When I worked Vice,
poker clubs would give out

07:32.950 --> 07:35.475
personalized chips
to repeat customers

07:35.520 --> 07:37.511
to reward loyalty
and weed out cops.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.916
Show these,
skip the line.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.087
Chinatown Vice can tell us

07:42.120 --> 07:44.486
which parlors use
which tiles.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.998
Wow, you, you look
incredible.

07:47.030 --> 07:48.588
Yeah, well, you look terrible.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.563
You're using again.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.488
What's the old saying,

07:53.540 --> 07:54.962
"Rehab is for quitters"?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.661
What do you want, Liam?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.598
I need your help.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.198
If by "help" you mean bail...

08:00.240 --> 08:02.640
I don't.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.272
You want to tell me
what you dId?

08:04.310 --> 08:06.244
According to the cops?

08:06.280 --> 08:07.645
Hit-and-run.
Oh...

08:07.680 --> 08:09.511
I don't think that
I did it, okay?

08:09.550 --> 08:10.881
What do you mean,
you don't think
that you did it?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.218
I partied a couple nights
ago, I passed out.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.683
I wake up in the morning,
there's these two cops

08:15.720 --> 08:17.688
banging on my door, saying
that I ran a red light

08:17.730 --> 08:19.595
at 2:00 in the morning,

08:22.630 --> 08:24.894
(sighs)

08:24.930 --> 08:27.239
Why'd they think it was you?
Because

08:27.270 --> 08:29.909
somebody got a picture
of my car speeding away

08:29.940 --> 08:31.931
and got the license plate
and everything.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.029
It wasn't me, okay?
Joanie, you know how bad

08:34.080 --> 08:35.536
I've always been
with my keys.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.309
I probably left them in the car.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.568
Somebody saw it,
took it for a joyride...

08:39.620 --> 08:41.076
Liam!
Look, I think I
would've remembered

08:41.120 --> 08:43.281
clipping someone else's car.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.719
Not if you were blacked out,
you wouldn't.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.183
Listen, all I'm asking is

08:46.220 --> 08:49.053
if you could just
put in a good word

08:49.090 --> 08:51.923
with your friend,
you know, the one
at the D.A.'s office.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.224
You know what?

08:54.260 --> 08:56.296
I know this isn't what
you want to hear,

08:56.330 --> 08:59.959
but I can't do it.
I can't help you anymore.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.864
I can't.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.707
You treat all the guys
you slept with

09:04.740 --> 09:06.674
this nice, or
is it just me?

09:06.710 --> 09:09.133
Just you.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.068
(phone chimes)

09:12.680 --> 09:15.319
Oh, good,
you're here.

09:15.350 --> 09:16.817
You can deal
with him.

09:16.850 --> 09:18.579
Everything okay?

09:18.620 --> 09:20.349
Spent the entire
car ride yammering

09:20.390 --> 09:21.948
into a digital recorder.

09:21.990 --> 09:23.355
Something about
the effect on tides

09:23.390 --> 09:24.880
on crime rates
In New York.

09:24.930 --> 09:26.625
I'm considering writing
a monograph.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.298
You should check
his fever.

09:28.330 --> 09:29.797
I think he's
hallucinating.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.821
How was your visit
to the penal colony?

09:31.870 --> 09:33.599
You sort your old client out?

09:33.640 --> 09:36.234
Well, private
information.

09:36.270 --> 09:39.137
Huh. Well, Detective Bell
has managed to acquire

09:39.170 --> 09:42.003
the addresses of three different
gambling parlors.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.349
We determined
Trent Annunzro was not

09:44.380 --> 09:46.007
in the first two
last night,

09:46.050 --> 09:48.245
so I'd say
you're just in time.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.721
NYPD.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.057
Can we come in?

10:05.070 --> 10:08.096
Can I help...
with your old client?

10:08.140 --> 10:10.358
It's obvious his predicament
is distracting you.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.628
He isn't your problem.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.275
No. But he and I are members
of a very exclusnve club,

10:16.310 --> 10:19.108
the sober clients
of Joan Watson.

10:19.150 --> 10:20.879
Brothers, in a sense.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.343
Is there any chance
he's innocent?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.278
He's not.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.652
(door sliding open)

10:31.460 --> 10:33.121
BELL:
You in charge here?

10:33.160 --> 10:34.957
(man speaks Mandarin)

10:35.000 --> 10:36.399
(man replies in Mandarin)

10:36.430 --> 10:38.193
Guys, who here
speaks English?

10:38.230 --> 10:40.369
Did he tell you
he was not innocent?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.231
He shot up
a few nights ago,

10:42.270 --> 10:43.908
hit a woman
with his car.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.737
He doesn't remember
because he blacked out.

10:45.770 --> 10:46.805
But not remembering
something

10:46.840 --> 10:48.876
doesn't mean you
didn't do it.

10:48.910 --> 10:50.446
Nor does it mean
you did do it.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.448
This client cros_sed
some boundaries.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.415
Abused my good faith on
more than one occasion.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.247
If this is how
he bottoms out,

10:57.290 --> 10:59.087
I have to let
it happen.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.418
No one here speaks English.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.827
No, Detective,
I don't believe that's true.

11:04.860 --> 11:08.125
You. Uh, you recently applied
bleach to this section

11:08.160 --> 11:11.129
of the floor,
did you not?

11:11.170 --> 11:12.728
We both know that you understand
me, just like we both know

11:12.770 --> 11:13.794
that you're not the janitor.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.239
You may have put that apron on,

11:15.270 --> 11:17.033
but you're still wearing
Bespoke Italian shoes.

11:17.070 --> 11:18.731
I think you own
this place,

11:18.770 --> 11:19.737
and if you do,

11:19.780 --> 11:21.702
you need to communicate
with suppliers, vendors.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.344
You speak English.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.701
So... (clears throat)
you recently applied bleach

11:25.750 --> 11:26.444
to this section of the floor and
this section of the floor only.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.845
I would like to know why.

11:34.490 --> 11:37.425
We had a drunk in the club.

11:37.460 --> 11:40.349
He threw up there.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.721
On an area this large?

11:42.770 --> 11:46.262
And with such force
you had to spackle the wall?

11:46.300 --> 11:48.336
I suggest you either
stop serving

11:48.370 --> 11:50.304
that particular cocktail
or you just admit

11:50.340 --> 11:52.308
that you had a shooting
in here, and you dug

11:52.340 --> 11:54.433
two slugs out of the wall.

11:56.310 --> 11:58.403
Fine, let's let
the video decide.

11:58.450 --> 11:59.474
What video?

11:59.510 --> 12:01.944
The one you recorded

12:01.980 --> 12:03.516
on that.

12:03.550 --> 12:04.915
BELL:
Um,

12:04.950 --> 12:07.510
Holmes, that's a smoke detector.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.913
Positioned directly
over a hibachi grill?

12:08.960 --> 12:10.359
I don't think so.

12:10.390 --> 12:11.926
That is a security
camera designed

12:11.960 --> 12:13.928
to look like
a smoke detector.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.222
I subscribe to several personal
security catalogs

12:15.260 --> 12:16.522
and I recognize the make
and the model,

12:16.560 --> 12:18.289
so... (clears throat)

12:18.330 --> 12:20.935
Would you like to take it
from here, Detective?

12:20.970 --> 12:22.460
Show us the footage
or you'll never

12:22.500 --> 12:25.435
deal another hand
in this place.

12:25.470 --> 12:27.335
Go get my computer.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.443
BELL:
There's our man.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.210
And there's the man
who shot our man.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.413
BELL:
Perp pulls a gun
on the bouncer, pushes in.

12:37.450 --> 12:38.542
"Give me all
your wallets

12:38.590 --> 12:39.909
or I'll shoot
your head off."

12:39.960 --> 12:42.451
No surprise, most do.

12:42.490 --> 12:44.481
Save Professor Annunzio.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.158
Mm, he's frozen up.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.451
You might not want
to watch this part.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.991
(Watson gasps)

12:52.030 --> 12:53.793
I take it we have you
or your people to thank

12:53.840 --> 12:55.467
for dumping him
under the Manhattan Bridge?

12:55.500 --> 12:58.162
Hey, we were
victims, too.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.563
I'd like to see
the other video--

12:59.610 --> 13:01.908
the one where you see
the gunman's face.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.544
What other video?

13:03.580 --> 13:05.844
Well, the hallway we came down
was a good 80 feet.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.541
If the gunman had come in
wearing a mask,

13:07.580 --> 13:10.185
the bouncer would've had more
than enough time to subdue him,

13:10.220 --> 13:11.812
or sound an alarm.

13:11.850 --> 13:13.181
But the commotion didn't start

13:13.220 --> 13:14.858
until the gunman
entered the club.

13:14.890 --> 13:17.552
He must've come down
the hallway, barefaced,

13:17.590 --> 13:19.478
and then pulled the gun.

13:19.530 --> 13:21.452
Yes, I know, you prefer
to keep his face to yourself.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.388
You probably have your
colleagues searching

13:23.430 --> 13:24.829
for him as we speak.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.519
You find him first,
you get your money back,

13:26.570 --> 13:28.936
and you get to exact whatever
punishment you see fit.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.859
Blah, blah, blah--
the video, please.

13:36.580 --> 13:39.504
Detective Bell, I give you
Trent Annunzio's murderer.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.592
Uh, maybe it's me,
but to look at mug shots,

13:57.630 --> 13:59.495
don't you have to take time
to actually look at them?

13:59.530 --> 14:01.259
I am taking time.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.860
In each case, I'm taking
exactly the right amount

14:03.910 --> 14:07.004
to confirm that none of these
men killed Trent Annunzio.

14:08.910 --> 14:11.970
Ugh, what-what is that?
I asked for coffee.

14:12.010 --> 14:13.978
Well, you asked for
coffee, but you got tea.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.887
No, I'm British--
this is not tea.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.286
There's some traditional
Chinese herbs in there.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.015
I poked around the stalls
in Chinatown

14:21.060 --> 14:22.584
while I was waiting for you.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.281
I found the ingredients
for the same tea

14:24.330 --> 14:25.581
my mom used to make me
when I was sick.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.359
Well, all due respect
to your mother,

14:27.400 --> 14:30.528
I would prefer something proven
by a scientific method.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.197
The herbs in that tea_ have been
proven SCIentIfIcally

14:32.230 --> 14:33.891
to inhibit the movement
of neutrophlls,

14:33.940 --> 14:35.589
improve the function
of protective cilia,

14:35.640 --> 14:37.301
and contribute
to longer-lasting,

14:37.340 --> 14:39.638
more vasodilated erections.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.035
By your mother?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.707
Just shut up and drink it.

14:46.580 --> 14:48.377
What is that?

14:48.420 --> 14:49.910
That's the arrest report
from your former client,

14:49.950 --> 14:51.383
Liam Danow.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.479
I didn't tell
you hIs name.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.215
You told me his crime, date
of arrest, sex of his victim.

14:55.260 --> 14:57.649
Consciously or not, you knew
I could put that together.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.658
I said I didn't want your help.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.419
Well, I haven't given it
to you yet.

15:01.460 --> 15:03.621
I haven't even cracked
the spine.

15:03.670 --> 15:07.231
I just thought you might want
all the facts at your disposal.

15:07.270 --> 15:08.498
What for?

15:08.540 --> 15:09.564
Well, it's rather difficult

15:09.600 --> 15:11.329
to give up
on someone completely.

15:11.370 --> 15:13.429
Harder if you are
a professional

15:13.480 --> 15:16.005
addiction counselor
I would Imagine.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.941
I just thought
you'd want to be sure.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.413
Hey.

15:20.450 --> 15:22.418
I finally found something
in the photo system.

15:22.450 --> 15:24.179
Raul Ramirez.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.643
Served stretches in Sing Sing
for rape and armed robbery.

15:26.690 --> 15:28.282
ESU and a couple of our
guys are heading over

15:28.320 --> 15:30.959
to his place in
Bushwick right now.

15:39.530 --> 15:40.633
This picture...

15:41.640 --> 15:43.130
...doesn't look good

15:43.170 --> 15:44.239
for you, Raul.

15:46.210 --> 15:49.702
These are the wallets you stole
from the mahjong parlor.

15:49.740 --> 15:53.016
We found them in your garbage.

15:53.050 --> 15:55.143
Oh, and of course,

15:55.180 --> 15:58.343
there's this--
Trent Annunzio's wallet,

15:58.390 --> 16:02.019
covered in his dried blood.

16:02.060 --> 16:03.687
Hook, line,

16:03.730 --> 16:06.051
sinker.

16:09.630 --> 16:12.565
What if I give somebody up
to you guys?

16:12.600 --> 16:14.659
Get some sort of

16:14.700 --> 16:16.736
a special consideration
or something?

16:16.770 --> 16:19.603
Well, I guess that depends.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.631
Who you talking about?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.602
Guy who hired me.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.971
You were hired
to do what you did?

16:29.450 --> 16:32.146
Look, I get home one night
last week, okay?

16:32.190 --> 16:35.011
There's an envelope pushed
under my door.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.118
I look inside.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.788
It's a thousand dollars
In cash.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.297
All of a sudden,
my phone rings.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.594
Guy on the
other end says

16:42.630 --> 16:44.166
he knows me
from the neighborhood.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.725
Says he knows
about my rap sheet, everything.

16:46.770 --> 16:49.489
Says he's got
another nine grand for me...

16:49.540 --> 16:51.337
If you kill Trent Annunzio.

16:51.370 --> 16:54.032
Not just kill him.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.799
Shoot him once in each eye.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.502
Did he say why he wanted him
shot in the eyes?

17:02.750 --> 17:04.081
Supposed to shoot him
tomorrow night

17:04.120 --> 17:06.145
when he walked to his car
from his office.

17:06.190 --> 17:09.318
Thing is-- been trailing him
the past few days.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.726
Followed him into
that gambling parlor.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.058
Saw it was fat with cash.

17:14.100 --> 17:17.524
Figured ifI saw him
go in there again...

17:17.570 --> 17:19.424
two birds with one stone.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.836
Did you ever meet
with this guy?

17:21.870 --> 17:25.203
He always just
called or texted.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.471
His voice was real scrambled up
on the phone, too.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.247
Check my cell phone...

17:32.280 --> 17:34.441
you'll see the pictures
he sent me.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.085
Ramirez's story
checks out so far.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.712
Someone texted him
that two days ago.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.752
Told him where
Annunzio parked, too.

17:40.790 --> 17:44.578
I'm guessing the guy who hired
him used a disposable cell?

17:44.630 --> 17:46.359
Yeah, prepaid burner.

17:46.390 --> 17:48.255
Only calls incoming or
outgoing were to Ramirez.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.689
Okay, if this isn't random,

17:50.730 --> 17:53.062
who had it in
for this guy Annunzio?

17:55.270 --> 17:57.431
If it was the person
who took this picture,

17:57.470 --> 17:59.199
then it was a friend.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.878
Or a family member, maybe?

18:00.910 --> 18:02.798
Hmm.
What?

18:02.840 --> 18:04.774
Um, no, it's just that

18:04.810 --> 18:06.471
the bottom left of this photo,

18:06.510 --> 18:09.809
there's discoloration,
there's a rectangle

18:09.850 --> 18:11.841
where it's lighter.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.350
I must be sicker
than I thought.

18:16.390 --> 18:17.857
I don't know how
I missed that.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.495
Um, this is a reflection
of a window

18:20.530 --> 18:22.122
judging by the shape of it,

18:22.160 --> 18:26.290
which means this is
a photograph of a photograph.

18:26.330 --> 18:27.866
The original was under glass.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.834
The frame cropped out.

18:29.870 --> 18:31.758
Well, there are a lot
of framed photos at the house.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.801
This wasn't taken
at the house.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.829
See this shape?

18:34.880 --> 18:37.474
Circle with a square inside it?

18:37.510 --> 18:40.673
That's a Chinese good luck
charm that Annunzio kept

18:40.720 --> 18:44.645
in the window of his office.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.544
So...

18:46.590 --> 18:49.309
if Ramirez is
telling the truth,

18:49.360 --> 18:50.827
all we got to do
is find someone

18:50.860 --> 18:52.555
that access _
to Annunzro's office

18:52.590 --> 18:56.822
and lives in Raul Ramirez's
neighborhood.

18:56.860 --> 18:59.863
I know someone who fits
that particular bill.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.891
This is ridiculous.

19:01.940 --> 19:04.932
I-I've never heard
of Raul Ramirez.

19:04.970 --> 19:06.733
He lives
two blocks away.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.670
Same block as
your gym actually.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.302
How do you know
where I go to the gym?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.578
Your key chain.

19:11.610 --> 19:12.838
Noticed it earlier

19:12.880 --> 19:15.178
when you let us into
Annunzio's office.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.414
Might not have remembered it

19:16.450 --> 19:18.645
_ were it not for_ that
hideous aquamarine hue.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.510
Do you know how
many people live here?

19:20.560 --> 19:21.959
Not that many
who blamed Trent Annunzio

19:21.990 --> 19:24.481
for destroying
their career.

19:24.530 --> 19:25.679
We know that
you applied for

19:25.730 --> 19:27.459
a full-time job
at Berkeley.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.491
Three week back, we know
that Annunzio sent a letter

19:29.530 --> 19:30.963
to the head of the department.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.458
"While Mr. O'Brien does exhibit
a kind of Horatio Alger

19:34.500 --> 19:37.936
"can-do spirit, the sad truth
is his work is simply

19:37.970 --> 19:39.335
"never developed.

19:39.370 --> 19:41.679
I can not in good conscience
recommend him."

19:41.710 --> 19:44.975
How many years did you work
as Annunzio's T.A.?

19:45.010 --> 19:47.319
Four, and...

19:47.350 --> 19:49.978
I wasn't happy he sandbagged me,

19:50.020 --> 19:51.988
obviously, but...

19:52.020 --> 19:53.851
I didn't kill him.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.858
We found a draft on his
computer, a letter

19:55.890 --> 19:57.528
of complaint he started writing
a few days ago

19:57.560 --> 19:59.221
to campus security.

19:59.260 --> 20:00.625
You threatened to "make him pay"

20:00.660 --> 20:01.854
when you heard about the letter.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.221
This is Kafka-esque.

20:04.270 --> 20:05.669
We're academics.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.668
We write nasty letters
to the Paris Review

20:07.700 --> 20:08.997
when we get mad
at each other.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.860
We don't hire hit men.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.572
OFFICER:
Detective?

20:15.340 --> 20:17.342
There's pink
in your cheeks.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.974
You don't look clammy anymore.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.012
I haven't taken your temperature
or anything,

20:22.050 --> 20:23.244
but to the naked eye,
you look better.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.814
Well, I feel better.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.353
Must've been a weaker
flu than I thought.

20:27.390 --> 20:29.688
Or the tea is working.

20:32.930 --> 20:35.319
BELL:
Got a burner phone.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.726
Mr. O'Brien,

20:37.770 --> 20:40.864
how do you think
Kafka would explain this?

20:40.900 --> 20:42.891
I've never seen that before.

20:42.940 --> 20:44.703
Really? Because we found it
under your bed.

20:44.740 --> 20:46.935
And it's only ever
dialed one phone number,

20:46.970 --> 20:48.369
Raul Ramirez.

20:48.410 --> 20:49.900
This ties
you to Raul.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.373
Excuse me, Captain?

20:51.410 --> 20:54.777
This doesn't
look good.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.048
Whatever it is,
can it wait?

20:56.080 --> 20:57.286
The guy's about
to confess.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.947
I-I seriously doubt that.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.412
I'm starting to think
if he had anything at all

21:00.460 --> 21:02.815
to do with Annunzio's death.

21:02.860 --> 21:05.658
We just found the phone that
he used to contact Ramirez.

21:05.690 --> 21:07.294
Yes, but isn't the whole
point of a burner phone

21:07.330 --> 21:08.524
to "burn" it _
after you've used It?

21:08.560 --> 21:09.822
Why's he gonna hold on to it?

21:09.860 --> 21:11.919
Because he still needed
to reach Ramirez.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.336
Because he's_ an idiot-_-
you're overthinking this.

21:14.370 --> 21:16.338
Not everyone's
a criminal mastermind.

21:16.370 --> 21:17.769
Yes, true, but even so,

21:17.810 --> 21:19.960
he exhibited absolutely
no signs of distress

21:20.010 --> 21:22.001
when your men went
to search his bedroom, hmm?

21:22.040 --> 21:25.009
Now, even if he were stupid
enough to hold onto the phone,

21:25.050 --> 21:28.349
would he be stupid enough
to forget that he'd done so?

21:28.380 --> 21:29.938
I don't know what you two
are talking about,

21:29.980 --> 21:31.516
but you just missed the show.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.359
O'Brien just confessed
to everything.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.887
Thank God
for stupid people.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.692
DETECTIVE (on video):
This would be on the 12th?

21:45.730 --> 21:47.869
O'BRIEN:
Yes, that's right,
I contacted him on the 12th.

21:47.900 --> 21:50.368
DETECTIVE:
And you told him where he could
find Trent Annunzio?

21:50.410 --> 21:51.968
O'BRIEN:
Yeah, I told him
where he could find Trent...

21:52.010 --> 21:53.739
You're still
watching this?

21:53.780 --> 21:55.372
It isn't right.

21:55.410 --> 21:57.037
He's giving
no corroborative detail.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.570
He's just rephrasing
the questions he's asked

21:58.610 --> 22:00.976
in the form of statements.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.113
Mr. O'Brien, did you first
attempt to construct

22:03.150 --> 22:05.380
a massive robot_
to kill Trent Annun2io?

22:05.420 --> 22:07.786
Yes, I first attempted
to construct a massive robot

22:07.820 --> 22:09.082
to kill Trent Annunzio.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.348
You still don't think
he did it?

22:11.590 --> 22:14.354
Not sure.

22:16.630 --> 22:18.427
What's all this?

22:18.470 --> 22:22.463
These are Mr. O'Brien's
bank statements, some mail.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.559
Anything and everything
that Captain Gregson would

22:24.610 --> 22:26.009
give me access to
before I left

22:26.040 --> 22:27.473
the station this evening.

22:27.510 --> 22:30.377
I was hoping that it would
give me more insight

22:30.410 --> 22:31.570
into the man,
but so far...

22:31.610 --> 22:35.774
Well, he certainly downloaded
a lot of music.

22:35.820 --> 22:38.516
Over a hundred songs
last month alone.

22:38.550 --> 22:40.484
Almost exclusively bad.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.954
"My Heart Will Go On."

22:42.990 --> 22:45.424
I have a good mind
to let him rot.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.866
(grunts)

22:51.900 --> 22:54.835
Hey, I wanted to talk
to you about Liam.

22:54.870 --> 22:56.997
My brother in track-marked arms?

22:57.040 --> 22:59.031
Yeah. I took the file
that you dug up,

22:59.070 --> 23:00.674
the one with the details
of his arrest.

23:05.610 --> 23:07.419
That's Liam's.

23:07.450 --> 23:10.078
The damage would suggest
a pretty major collision,

23:10.120 --> 23:12.111
but when I saw him, he didn't
have a scratch on him.

23:12.150 --> 23:14.050
Now, if he'd been wearing
a seat belt,

23:14.090 --> 23:15.785
I would have seen belt burn
on his neck and chest.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.959
If he hadn't been
wearing one,

23:17.990 --> 23:19.878
he would had a contusion
where his head hit

23:19.930 --> 23:21.192
the windshield
or steering wheel.

23:21.230 --> 23:22.857
He lives in Astoria.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.027
There have been
a series of joyrides there.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.061
The thief abandons
the car afterwards,

23:27.100 --> 23:29.091
but strips and pawns
anything of value.

23:29.140 --> 23:32.439
The problem is, all of the cars
the joyrider stole

23:32.470 --> 23:34.074
were hotwired, Liam's was not.

23:34.110 --> 23:36.738
It says here the keys
were found in the ignition.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.203
He said he sometimes
left them in the car.

23:39.250 --> 23:42.014
Another discrepancy; nothing
was stripped or stolen.

23:44.150 --> 23:45.742
You know what?

23:45.790 --> 23:47.610
I gave Liam a Christmas present
one year.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.652
It was a silver key chain
pendant with a watch built in.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.453
You think something was stolen
after all?

23:52.490 --> 23:54.629
It looked expensive,
but it wasn't.

23:54.660 --> 23:56.821
Maybe the guy who stole the car
couldn't tell the difference.

23:56.860 --> 23:58.566
I would be remiss
if I didn't point out

23:58.600 --> 24:00.124
that Liam may have pawned it
himself.

24:00.170 --> 24:03.731
We addicts are, as you know,
not a sentimental lot.

24:03.770 --> 24:05.465
Can I ask you
something?

24:05.510 --> 24:07.000
How long were you working
with Liam

24:07.040 --> 24:09.508
before you started sleeping
with him?

24:11.280 --> 24:12.907
Your disappointment in him

24:12.950 --> 24:14.508
the other day seemed
a little... extreme.

24:14.550 --> 24:16.177
Especially for an
addiction specialist who has

24:16.220 --> 24:18.643
no doubt seen clients fall off
the wagon before.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.487
And now to note the absence
of a trifle

24:20.520 --> 24:22.158
that you gave him
years ago...

24:22.190 --> 24:23.214
No judgment.

24:23.260 --> 24:24.227
Just curiosity.

24:24.260 --> 24:25.852
I'm heading to Rikers
first thing tomorrow.

24:25.890 --> 24:27.892
You okay without me
for a few hours?

24:28.960 --> 24:31.565
(departing footsteps)

24:43.110 --> 24:45.146
I'm sorry, but I am confused.

24:45.180 --> 24:47.273
You think that

24:47.310 --> 24:49.847
Mr. O'Brien and I
were having an affair?

24:49.880 --> 24:50.915
These mix CDs,

24:50.950 --> 24:52.781
the ones with your
name on them--

24:52.820 --> 24:55.152
I realized last night
that they were made

24:55.190 --> 24:58.751
entirely from songs
purchased by Mr. O'Brien

24:58.790 --> 24:59.882
over the last few months.

24:59.930 --> 25:01.192
Almost entirely

25:01.230 --> 25:03.721
from love songs.

25:03.770 --> 25:07.729
Not the grandest
of romantic gestures,

25:07.770 --> 25:10.068
but still, it's not like
he could afford

25:10.100 --> 25:13.001
expensive jewelry for you,
not on a T.A.'s salary.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.234
You should have
seen his face

25:14.280 --> 25:15.599
when the police found the phone

25:15.640 --> 25:16.777
that connected him
to Trent's murder.

25:16.810 --> 25:18.607
He was stunned.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.618
Probably because he had no idea

25:20.650 --> 25:23.585
that the phone
was in his home. Hmm?

25:24.920 --> 25:27.241
You put it there, didn't you?

25:27.290 --> 25:29.679
I don't know
anything about a phone.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.585
There's one thing
that still puzzles me,

25:31.630 --> 25:34.098
is why he confessed.

25:34.130 --> 25:35.620
I've been racking my brain.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.163
I can only come up with
two possible answers.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.566
One, he thought you
left it there by mistake

25:40.600 --> 25:42.591
after a tryst, and
you were planning

25:42.640 --> 25:45.700
to go back, retrieve it,
dispose of it,

25:45.740 --> 25:48.607
having no idea that the police
would recover it first.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.279
Two, he's the ultimate sap.

25:51.310 --> 25:53.619
He realized that
you set him up,

25:53.650 --> 25:56.175
but he loves you so much,

25:56.220 --> 25:58.017
he thought he'd just take
the fall anyway.

25:58.050 --> 26:01.315
Either way, he comes
off looking a bit dim.

26:01.360 --> 26:05.023
Please, I'd like you
to leave now.

26:05.060 --> 26:07.085
If you have something
to tell us,

26:07.130 --> 26:08.950
the sooner, the better.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.594
Not just for Brendan O'Brien,
but for you.

26:16.740 --> 26:20.699
This is an old manual given
to Chinese political police.

26:20.740 --> 26:23.709
It teaches how
to beat a suspect,

26:23.750 --> 26:26.048
but leave no marks.

26:26.080 --> 26:30.710
He used these
techniques to hurt me.

26:30.750 --> 26:35.084
And he also made
me do things.

26:35.120 --> 26:39.056
Sex things, horrible things
while he taped them.

26:39.090 --> 26:41.126
BELL: _
Let's say we believe you,
Mrs. Annunzio.

26:41.160 --> 26:44.061
That doesn't justify murder.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.988
I had nothing to do
with Trent's death.

26:46.030 --> 26:48.191
I don't believe Brendan
did either.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.061
I... I can't explain
how the phone that was used

26:51.110 --> 26:54.102
to contact Trent's killer
got into Brendan's apartment,

26:54.140 --> 26:56.904
but I do know he would
never take a life.

26:56.940 --> 27:00.148
Respectfully, Mrs. Annunzio,
you've just told us

27:00.180 --> 27:03.069
that your husband was a sadist
and a pervert.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.088
Assuming that's true,

27:05.120 --> 27:07.850
why would we trust
your judgment?

27:09.260 --> 27:12.081
Trent was not my husband.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.927
He promised to marry
me when he asked me

27:13.960 --> 27:16.656
_ to _come to America
With him several years ago.

27:16.700 --> 27:21.660
But then when we arrived here,
he went back on that promise.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.305
He knew I could
not go to the police

27:24.340 --> 27:25.967
without revealing my status.

27:26.010 --> 27:28.035
I could be deported.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.844
And when did Brendan
come into the picture?

27:30.880 --> 27:36.216
He came to the house one day
to leave something for Trent.

27:36.250 --> 27:41.119
And he found me crying...

27:41.160 --> 27:42.855
and he held me.

27:42.890 --> 27:46.121
And when the time was right,
I was going to leave Trent,

27:46.160 --> 27:49.027
and Brendan and I
were g0ing to marry.

27:49.060 --> 27:52.166
You told us that, um,
you lied to us the other day,

27:52.200 --> 27:55.738
so why should
we believe you now?

27:55.770 --> 27:58.898
The... the videos he made of me.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.238
He kept them all on
this computer.

28:03.010 --> 28:05.444
There's even one in
which he beat me.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.919
They were, they were all here!

28:12.950 --> 28:14.383
Mrs. Annunzio, I think it's time

28:14.420 --> 28:16.115
we took this back
to the station.

28:21.260 --> 28:23.091
LIAM:
I don't really get it.

28:23.130 --> 28:25.189
What exactly am
I supposed to be looking for?

28:25.230 --> 28:26.868
Anything out
of the ordinary.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.901
I'm sorry about what I said
to you the other day.

28:35.940 --> 28:37.407
About you not treating me right.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.443
It's fine.
No, it's not fine.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.917
When I think about some of the
things that I did, Ijust...

28:44.950 --> 28:47.180
It makes you crazy.
There are nights
you wake up crying.

28:47.220 --> 28:48.858
You wish you had
it all to do

28:48.890 --> 28:50.118
over again, you'd do it
differently.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.025
We've had this conversation
before.

28:52.060 --> 28:54.858
You've apologized to me before.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.767
I know you feel sorry, because
if you didn't, why say it?

28:57.800 --> 29:00.860
What I've never understood
is why you don't put yourself

29:00.900 --> 29:03.266
in a position to stop
apologizing to people.

29:12.250 --> 29:16.209
The key chain pendant,
the one you gave me

29:16.250 --> 29:18.787
that year for Christmas,
it's not here.

29:18.820 --> 29:21.914
You're sure?

29:21.960 --> 29:24.952
Yeah, I'm sure.

29:27.130 --> 29:28.119
(door closes)

29:31.930 --> 29:34.091
Watson...

29:34.140 --> 29:36.859
how was your day?

29:36.900 --> 29:38.333
Whose computer is that?

29:38.370 --> 29:39.564
It's Trent Annunzio's.

29:39.610 --> 29:41.339
Borrowing it.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.029
Why?

29:43.080 --> 29:45.105
Because...

29:45.150 --> 29:47.345
I strongly suspect that
it may once have contained

29:47.380 --> 29:50.269
evidence that would prove
Annunzio abused his wife.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.118
I thought the hard drive
may have been swapped out,

29:53.150 --> 29:56.051
but that doesn't appear
to be the case.

29:56.090 --> 29:59.287
You said this morning
that she was the one

29:59.330 --> 30:02.254
who hired Raul Ramirez
to kill him.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.222
I did.

30:04.270 --> 30:07.159
Then why are you looking for
evidence to help her?

30:07.200 --> 30:10.590
Because, upon further
examination of the facts,

30:10.640 --> 30:13.302
I now have reason to believe
that I was wrong,

30:13.340 --> 30:16.832
and that in accusing her, I may
have inadvertently positioned

30:16.880 --> 30:19.371
the United Stated Immigration
and Customs Enforcement Agency

30:19.410 --> 30:22.208
to separate an innocent woman
from her infant daughter

30:22.250 --> 30:24.912
on a very permanent basis.

30:28.990 --> 30:31.424
That tea that you made
the other day,

30:31.460 --> 30:34.020
could you make some more of it?

30:37.300 --> 30:39.461
I keep asking myself,

30:39.500 --> 30:41.639
why would she tell us about
her husband's brutality

30:41.670 --> 30:43.331
if she wasn't absolutely certain

30:43.370 --> 30:45.099
that she could show
us some proof?

30:45.140 --> 30:47.301
You think someone
wiped his computer for him?

30:47.340 --> 30:49.376
It's hard to say.

30:49.410 --> 30:51.275
I haven't exactly been
at my best lately.

30:51.310 --> 30:52.504
Well, you were right

30:52.550 --> 30:54.245
about Liam--
that pendant I gave him,

30:54.280 --> 30:56.214
it was stolen.
He told me this morning.

30:56.250 --> 30:58.946
I spent the rest
of the day visiting
pawnshops in Queens

30:58.990 --> 31:00.389
until I found it.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.911
The owner knew the kid
who brought it in,

31:02.960 --> 31:05.428
so once the police find him,
they're gonna let Liam go.

31:05.460 --> 31:08.896
Mm. Well done, Watson.

31:08.930 --> 31:12.093
Perhaps you should take the
reins on the Annunzio case.

31:16.370 --> 31:19.931
I didn't tell you
the whole story.

31:19.970 --> 31:21.972
Liam's not an ex-client.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.149
He's just... an ex.

31:27.010 --> 31:30.070
You were romantically involved;
you just weren't his companion.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.315
Imamm_
on an ER rotation

31:32.350 --> 31:34.159
back when I was
still a resident.

31:34.190 --> 31:37.057
Some lady got
her purse snatched
in front of him.

31:37.090 --> 31:38.421
He tackled the guy,
the guy smashed his skull

31:38.460 --> 31:40.280
with a bottle and ran off.

31:40.330 --> 31:42.457
I gave him 39 stitches.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.525
Was he already using?

31:44.570 --> 31:48.097
No.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.165
No, that came later.

31:52.340 --> 31:55.537
I hosted an intervention,
I drove him to rehab.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.174
He was better when he came out,

31:58.210 --> 31:59.973
but only for a little while.

32:00.010 --> 32:04.185
Everything that followed
is typically what follows.

32:04.220 --> 32:06.984
A lot of lies,

32:07.020 --> 32:08.556
heartbreak.

32:08.590 --> 32:10.319
Anyway, the upside was that

32:10.360 --> 32:13.989
I learned a lot about how
to deal with people like him.

32:14.030 --> 32:16.055
So when I left medicine,

32:16.100 --> 32:18.466
companionship seemed like
a pretty natural fit.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.492
(phone chimes)

32:21.540 --> 32:24.566
Hmm.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.408
It's the autopsy report
on Trent Annunzio.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.328
The ME found dried
chrysanthemum

32:29.380 --> 32:31.041
and mulberry leaf in
his stomach contents.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.342
Oh, those are both...

32:32.380 --> 32:34.439
Medicinal Chinese herbs.
Yes, well aware.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.643
This particular combination
is used to treat eye pain.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.715
How did you know that?

32:38.750 --> 32:41.287
I may have done some research
into the efficacy

32:41.320 --> 32:43.254
of Chinese medicine
after the herbs that you gave me

32:43.290 --> 32:45.383
had a positive correlation
with my recovery.

32:45.430 --> 32:50.299
Aanay, point is, this could
hardly be a coincidence.

32:50.330 --> 32:54.391
He was shot in both eyes while
self-medicating for eye pain.

32:54.440 --> 32:58.308
I noticed something
back at his apartment.

32:58.340 --> 33:00.604
There was a photograph of him
and his students.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.677
Everyone in it had, um,

33:03.710 --> 33:06.304
red eye from the camera flash
except for him.

33:06.350 --> 33:08.477
I didn't give it much thought,
but it's possible

33:08.520 --> 33:11.045
that something was blocking
his tapetum lucidum.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.341
The reflective part
of the retina.

33:12.390 --> 33:13.482
Such as?

33:13.520 --> 33:16.182
Best guess would be a melanoma.

33:16.220 --> 33:19.121
We need to get
to the coroner's office.

33:19.160 --> 33:22.755
I think I know who arranged
Trent Annunzio's murder.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.064
GREGSON:
You want to tell me
what I'm looking at?

33:25.100 --> 33:26.419
Melanoma cells.

33:26.470 --> 33:27.767
The medical examiner

33:27.800 --> 33:29.665
found them a short while
ago in what was left

33:29.700 --> 33:32.339
of Trent Annunzio's eye sockets.

33:32.370 --> 33:33.507
He had cancer?

33:33.540 --> 33:35.531
Not just any cancer.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.571
Uveal melanoma.

33:37.610 --> 33:40.477
It's as painful
as it is untreatable.

33:40.510 --> 33:42.671
It's likely he only had
a few months to live.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.483
I'm confused.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.782
I thought you said
on the phone

33:45.820 --> 33:47.640
you knew who
killed Annunzio.

33:47.690 --> 33:49.180
I do.

33:49.220 --> 33:50.710
Annunzio.

33:52.590 --> 33:55.525
Imagine for a moment that, um...

33:55.560 --> 33:58.563
he was exactly the man
his wife said he was.

33:58.600 --> 34:01.433
He tortured her, physically,
psychologically.

34:01.470 --> 34:03.461
Forced her to perform
sexual acts

34:03.500 --> 34:05.104
in front of a camera.

34:05.140 --> 34:06.562
Now imagine he discovers
that his favorite

34:06.610 --> 34:09.431
plaything slash punching bag
is having an affair

34:09.480 --> 34:13.143
with his teaching assistant,
Mr. O'Brien.

34:13.180 --> 34:17.446
A man like Annunzio, prone
to deviousness and violence,

34:17.480 --> 34:20.313
no doubt started
plotting his revenge.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.784
Problem was,
he began to experience

34:22.820 --> 34:25.186
this-this terrible eye pain.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.585
He consults a doctor.

34:27.630 --> 34:28.824
He learned his fate.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.350
Rotten luck, or

34:30.400 --> 34:32.459
instant karma... doesn't matter.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.833
Annunzio was... was reeling.

34:35.870 --> 34:37.462
All he had left

34:37.500 --> 34:40.105
was his intellect
and his anger.

34:40.140 --> 34:42.108
So he devised a plan

34:42.140 --> 34:43.505
that would not
only exact revenge

34:43.540 --> 34:45.440
upon his wife and her lover,

34:45.480 --> 34:49.576
but also deliver_ him from
a slow and agoni2ing death.

34:49.620 --> 34:52.612
He found Raul Ramirez,

34:52.650 --> 34:54.208
and he hired him

34:54.260 --> 34:56.114
to be his very own executioner.

34:56.160 --> 34:58.628
After that,

34:58.660 --> 35:01.151
it was just a matter of gaining
access to O'Brien's apartment.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.259
Probably with a stolen key.
Mm.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.894
He planted evidence
that would implicate O'Brien--

35:05.930 --> 35:07.864
the phone used
to contact Ramirez--

35:07.900 --> 35:10.460
and then he writes
a recommendation

35:10.500 --> 35:12.639
that he knows would demonstrate

35:12.670 --> 35:14.501
that O'Brien
has motive for murder.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.405
Now all that's
left to do is to

35:16.440 --> 35:18.544
destroy any evidence that might

35:18.580 --> 35:20.275
unravel his plans:

35:20.310 --> 35:21.572
Firstly,
the incriminating videos

35:21.620 --> 35:22.848
he keeps on his computer.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.587
Secondly, his eyes.

35:25.620 --> 35:29.750
They're proof that he faced
a long, horrible illness.

35:29.790 --> 35:32.258
And he can't risk anyone
discovering his condition.

35:32.290 --> 35:34.429
There may be immediate
questions asked

35:34.460 --> 35:36.451
as to whether he arranged
his own murder.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.320
The only thing
he cannot account for

35:38.370 --> 35:41.567
is the unpredictable nature
of his would-be assassin.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.295
Ramirez was supposed to kill him

35:43.340 --> 35:44.739
when he was on
his way to his car.

35:44.770 --> 35:46.635
Instead, he kills him

35:46.670 --> 35:48.570
ahead of schedule, and makes it
look like a robbery gone wrong.

35:48.610 --> 35:49.770
Now, that's the last thing

35:49.810 --> 35:51.778
that he wanted.

35:51.810 --> 35:55.268
Annunzio wanted all fingers
pointed squarely at O'Brien.

35:56.850 --> 36:00.581
It's not a perfect theory,
Captain, but it fits.

36:00.620 --> 36:01.882
I think that Annunzio's wife

36:01.920 --> 36:05.629
and Mr. O'Brien
may well be innocent.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.685
Well, let's pretend for
a second that you're right.

36:07.730 --> 36:10.358
We can't just
cut O'Brien loose

36:10.400 --> 36:11.697
based on a theory.

36:11.730 --> 36:13.698
Not with the phone in evidence,

36:13.730 --> 36:14.958
and a signed confession.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.695
What about Jun?

36:16.740 --> 36:18.662
We didn't have enough
to hold her.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.234
We cut her loose to I.C.E.

36:20.270 --> 36:22.670
They already started
deportation proceedings.

36:22.710 --> 36:24.439
Now, I'm sorry,

36:24.480 --> 36:26.869
if you think this is all
part of a master plan

36:26.910 --> 36:28.548
concocted by the victim,

36:28.580 --> 36:31.743
then it's a damn good one.

36:39.730 --> 36:42.824
(traffic sounds, horn honks)

36:42.860 --> 36:46.364
(sighs)

36:46.400 --> 36:47.594
This is new.

36:47.630 --> 36:49.734
Old data, new location.

36:49.770 --> 36:51.863
Thought it might
jar something loose.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.605
Did you get
any sleep last night?

36:53.640 --> 36:54.868
Hard to sleep

36:54.910 --> 36:56.468
knowing a psychopath
may have managed

36:56.510 --> 36:58.273
to ruin two lives
from beyond the grave.

36:58.310 --> 37:00.744
Well, for some us,
I suppose.

37:01.850 --> 37:03.340
Well, I am gonna

37:03.380 --> 37:05.439
have to take a shower
before I go to Rikers.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.708
Carry on.

37:09.020 --> 37:10.612
Oh, you weren't kidding
when you said

37:10.660 --> 37:12.480
O'Brien and Ramirez
live close to each other.

37:12.530 --> 37:13.724
All part of the frame-up.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.398
I know, it's just...

37:15.430 --> 37:17.625
if I wanted to hire someone from
my neighborhood to kill you,

37:17.660 --> 37:19.696
how would I do it,
go door-to-door?

37:21.700 --> 37:23.531
aren't exactly easy to find.

37:23.570 --> 37:24.798
Especially when you're
limited by geography.

37:24.840 --> 37:28.674
So, if I wanted you dead,

37:28.710 --> 37:31.679
how would I find
my Raul Ramirez?

37:31.710 --> 37:33.871
You'd use a menu.

37:45.890 --> 37:47.881
Sex Offender Registry.

37:47.930 --> 37:49.955
You can't look up
killers by locale,

37:50.000 --> 37:51.661
but you can look up rapists.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.065
They're a subset
of violent offenders.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.989
It's not a leap to imagine

37:56.040 --> 37:57.837
that they would consider
murder for hire

37:57.870 --> 38:00.737
if the price was right.

38:00.770 --> 38:02.772
You type in O'Brien's address,

38:02.810 --> 38:05.278
find the nearest deviant.

38:06.510 --> 38:07.943
Only he wasn't
the nearest one.

38:07.980 --> 38:10.346
There's another guy
whose name came up first.

38:10.380 --> 38:11.938
Go back a screen.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.458
Dennis Kaminski.

38:14.490 --> 38:17.050
Multiple rape convictions,

38:17.090 --> 38:19.752
set up hidden cameras
in women's restrooms.

38:19.790 --> 38:21.849
And his name came up ﬁrst

38:21.900 --> 38:24.960
because he lives in
O'Brien's building.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.592
I don't get it.

38:26.630 --> 38:27.961
If Annunzio wanted
to use prOXImity

38:28.000 --> 38:29.968
to make O'Brien
look guiltier,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.969
why didn't he go
to this guy first?

38:33.010 --> 38:34.807
Who says he didn't?

38:37.580 --> 38:40.071
LIAM:
I don't know...
I don't know what to say.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.977
You don't have
to say anything.

38:43.020 --> 38:45.488
You didn't do what
the police said you did.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.841
Aanay, someone's going to
be here to release you soon.

38:50.660 --> 38:53.629
Take care of yourself.

38:53.660 --> 38:56.390
That's it?

38:56.430 --> 38:58.694
I'm sorry, I guess
I just, I don't know,

38:58.730 --> 39:02.689
I expected a
little more, uh...

39:02.740 --> 39:03.729
disappointment.

39:03.770 --> 39:07.399
I let that go
a long time ago.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.829
I want to get
clean, Joanie.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.848
Liam..._
I mean it.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.576
I figure after
everything you did for me,

39:14.620 --> 39:15.917
I gotta at least try, right?

39:15.950 --> 39:17.770
You're not supposed
to do it for me,

39:17.820 --> 39:19.708
you're supposed to
do it for yourself.
I know.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.581
Thought maybe,
I don't know,

39:21.620 --> 39:23.349
you could find me
a place to go.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.383
My friend runs
the 59th Street Clinic.

39:27.430 --> 39:29.751
IfI call her now, I'm sure
she'll make room for you.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.427
Like I said,

39:31.470 --> 39:34.098
you have to do this
for yourself.

39:34.130 --> 39:35.791
I'm not gonna be there
waiting for you.

39:42.810 --> 39:44.675
Y... you mean to say

39:44.710 --> 39:47.804
Trent was behind
everything that happened?

39:47.850 --> 39:50.671
Before your husband
contracted

39:50.720 --> 39:52.813
Raul Ramirez
to shoot him,

39:52.850 --> 39:54.989
he tried another man,

39:55.020 --> 39:57.056
one Dennis Kaminski.

39:57.090 --> 40:00.628
Mr. Kaminski was more suspicious
of your husband's overtures

40:00.660 --> 40:02.855
than Mr. Ramirez,
he also had more experience

40:02.900 --> 40:04.788
with surveillance equipment.

40:04.830 --> 40:07.128
Fearing that the police
were attempting to entrap him,

40:07.170 --> 40:09.934
he installed a small camera

40:09.970 --> 40:12.609
in the corridor
outside of his apartment.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.062
Next time he was contacted

40:14.110 --> 40:15.998
by his mystery benefactor,

40:16.040 --> 40:17.837
he said it would require
a further $1,000

40:17.880 --> 40:21.145
before he would even consider
the offer.

40:21.180 --> 40:23.876
The next day,

40:23.920 --> 40:25.512
the camera recorded this.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.948
Jun?

40:31.990 --> 40:33.480
What are you doing here?

40:33.530 --> 40:34.997
Well, thanks to

40:35.030 --> 40:37.897
this video,
Mr. O'Brien was just released,

40:37.930 --> 40:39.989
which is bully
for him but, uh...

40:40.030 --> 40:42.169
doesn't make you
any more of a citizen.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.566
I'm still going to be deported?

40:44.610 --> 40:46.009
Depends.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.008
7 Wereyou serious 77 77777 7 77 7 77 7 77 7

40:48.040 --> 40:50.736
that you two had discussed
the possibility of...

40:50.780 --> 40:51.849
tying the knot?

40:51.880 --> 40:54.644
Because if you were...

40:54.680 --> 40:56.045
Captain Gregson
has already reached out

40:56.080 --> 40:58.719
to a friend of his
in the City Clerk's Office.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.684
I can't make any promises,

41:00.720 --> 41:03.086
but my understanding is

41:03.120 --> 41:05.725
if you were to get married today

41:05.760 --> 41:08.024
that I.C.E. will have
to back off.

41:08.060 --> 41:11.962
It's not how I thought
we would do it, but...

41:12.000 --> 41:13.228
sure.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.005
*

41:22.680 --> 41:24.602
Good show, Mr. O'Brien.

41:41.630 --> 41:42.995
(door opens)

41:46.700 --> 41:49.533
I texted you.
You didn't have to come.

41:49.570 --> 41:51.538
As I explained
the other day,

41:51.570 --> 41:54.209
there's nothing more hazardous
to my health than boredom.

41:56.040 --> 41:59.043
Besides, I thought it might
be nice to meet the ex.

42:05.650 --> 42:07.641
(sighs)

42:09.960 --> 42:13.157
I'm pretty sure
he's not gonna show.

42:13.190 --> 42:15.192
Yet here you sit.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.761
I'll give him
ten more minutes.

42:25.040 --> 42:29.101
If there's someplace else
you have to be...

42:29.140 --> 42:32.576
Not tonight, Watson.

42:32.610 --> 42:35.579
Not tonight.
