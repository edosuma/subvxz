<i>He was an orphan child
born in a snowstorm</i>

00:30.155 --> 00:32.198
<i>crossin' the Great Plains.</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:36.578
<i>Sam's cradle rocked mostly
in the back of Joe Callahan's saloon.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:39.248
<i>First sounds he heard
were the rattlin' of dice</i>

00:39.331 --> 00:42.501
<i>and somebody throwin' chips
on a poker table.</i>

00:42.543 --> 00:44.711
<i>Seemed to influence the boy.</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:52.219
<i>Well, Sam grew up, went to school
made a number of tried and true friends</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:55.764
<i>learned how to smoke, play five-card-stud,</i>

00:55.848 --> 00:58.183
<i>and tell tall stories,</i>

00:58.225 --> 00:59.601
<i>fight and cuss.</i>

00:59.685 --> 01:03.021
<i>That Sam also got in the habit
of takin' chances.</i>

01:03.063 --> 01:06.233
<i>And, what's more,
he started gain' with the girls.</i>

01:09.611 --> 01:12.739
<i>Before much longer, Sam started shavin'.</i>

01:12.823 --> 01:16.869
<i>Heard he could make some money
workin' beef on the western plains,</i>

01:16.910 --> 01:21.165
<i>so he headed out
and got himself a job punchin' cattle.</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:23.542
<i>Got punched himself.</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:26.461
<i>When he wasn't ridin' herd,
he broke wild horses.</i>

01:26.545 --> 01:28.380
<i>At least he tried to.</i>

01:28.422 --> 01:32.176
<i>Met a lady in Abilene
with pink pantaloons.</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:34.553
<i>Learned all about the big, wide world.</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:40.976
<i>The United States government
heard about Sam</i>

01:41.059 --> 01:43.270
<i>and offered to go in partners with him.</i>

01:43.312 --> 01:47.441
<i>Said him and them combined
could lick the whole confederate army.</i>

01:47.733 --> 01:49.776
<i>Sam took up the offer.</i>

01:49.860 --> 01:53.989
<i>Did a little spying, scoutin' around.</i>

01:54.198 --> 01:56.825
<i>Once damn near
liked to got his head blowed off.</i>

01:57.117 --> 02:00.621
<i>General Sherman said, âWar is hell. â</i>

02:00.829 --> 02:02.956
<i>"Worse than that," Sam said,</i>

02:03.207 --> 02:04.958
<i>"the pay's bad."</i>

02:06.251 --> 02:09.045
<i>After the war,
Sam tried his hand at business.</i>

02:09.128 --> 02:10.380
<i>Failed.</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:14.134
<i>Rode shotgun on a stagecoach,
traded mules,</i>

02:14.259 --> 02:16.220
<i>did some work for the rail road.</i>

02:16.303 --> 02:20.807
<i>One time or another, he had a little money,
but always managed to lose it.</i>

02:23.477 --> 02:27.439
<i>Well, Sam grew a little older,
though not much wiser.</i>

02:27.522 --> 02:31.568
<i>Besides women,
his taste ran to good music</i>

02:31.818 --> 02:34.154
<i>and strong cigars.</i>

02:34.196 --> 02:35.530
<i>Oh, incidentally,</i>

02:35.614 --> 02:38.992
<i>Sam never got over the habit
of takin' chances.</i>

03:15.654 --> 03:17.155
So long, fella.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.201
<i>Awakee napa, Goholo.</i>

03:29.543 --> 03:33.964
<i>I know it ain't none of my business, mister,
but was that your horse?</i>

03:34.047 --> 03:35.716
It used to be.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.635
Well, what the hell happened?

03:38.719 --> 03:41.096
I lost him in a card game.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.223
And you paid up to a Yaqui?

03:43.265 --> 03:44.266
That's right.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.816
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.236
- You got any rye?
- You betcha.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.363
Are you buyin' for two?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.450
Ma'am, I'm gonna save you and me
a whole lotta trouble.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.951
What do you mean by that?

04:03.035 --> 04:04.911
All I'm in the market for is a hot bath.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.289
That sounds wonderful.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.250
- You got a tub?
- Back room. Two bits.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.752
Jed, you shoe my horse?

04:11.793 --> 04:13.295
- This afternoon, Pete.
- Thanks.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.880
- Hi, Agnes.
- Hi.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.466
- Clem, my bath ready yet?
- You betcha.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.716
Thank you.

04:21.136 --> 04:24.556
Here's for the rye, and here's for the tub.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.183
You'll have to wait your turn, mister.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.018
Blacksmith put in his bid this morning.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.937
I don't have time for him to be first.
I gotta meet the stage.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.773
I got an important meeting with a lady.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.900
You'll have to settle that with him, mister.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.116
Howdy.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.534
Howdy.

04:44.618 --> 04:48.955
I... I'll give you a dollar,
and I'll take the bath first, huh?

04:49.456 --> 04:50.499
Nope.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.377
- You're a blacksmith, huh?
- Yep.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.629
My name's Sam Whiskey.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.798
My name's Jedidiah Hooker.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.635
Those cavalry britches you got on?

05:02.552 --> 05:03.637
Yep.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.974
<i>Well, I'll give you $2.00,
and I'll take the bath first.</i>

05:08.350 --> 05:09.434
Nope.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.520
How much?

05:12.813 --> 05:16.149
Mister, could you please
take your hand out of my bath water?

05:16.233 --> 05:19.361
I bet if I was to shove your head
in that tub, you'd change your mind.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.530
Which of your two legs
you want broke first?

05:22.280 --> 05:24.116
What... What the...

05:28.537 --> 05:31.498
I'll tell you what, mister.
Marguerite'll get some water

05:31.581 --> 05:34.042
and swab you down
by the corral personally.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.711
Then you can be all washed up with...

05:44.136 --> 05:46.555
A man sure has a hard time
gettin' a bath in this town.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.019
If you hit me with that spittoon,
I'm not gonna like it.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.203
Hold it!

06:21.673 --> 06:22.841
Pardon me.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.500
Let's everybody calm down
before somebody gets hurt.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.753
That's for the damages,

06:59.836 --> 07:03.256
and, Marshal,
that's for disturbing the peace.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.092
I'll just take my bath someplace else.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.261
Good idea.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.476
Thanks.

07:14.559 --> 07:18.271
If you still want that bath,
there's a horse trough down at my place.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.065
You're welcome to use it.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.734
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

07:22.859 --> 07:25.320
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

07:25.612 --> 07:28.949
<i>Mary McCarty loves whiskey and...</i>

07:31.868 --> 07:34.454
You know, you're a
pretty fair fighter for a blacksmith.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.289
But you need to work on your timing.

07:36.373 --> 07:39.209
- I'll try and remember that.
- I'll give you a little piece of advice.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.629
During a fight, try to keep calm.
Never lose your temper.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.506
<i>I'll keep that in mind.</i>

07:44.589 --> 07:47.425
One more thing,
never lead with your right hand.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.804
You know what I mean?
Keep your right hand back here like this.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.138
Lead with your left.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.474
Yeah, I get the idea.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.393
Good.

07:59.771 --> 08:00.897
You probably didn't realize it,

08:00.981 --> 08:04.150
but I'm one of the most feared
fighting men in this part of the country.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.152
I didn't know that.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.491
I guess I'm lucky to come out alive.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.621
- How do?
- Howdy.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.540
Mrs. Laura Breckenridge.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.959
She is in number seven. Upstairs.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.168
Thank you.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.114
Hi. Mrs. Laura Breckenridge?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.951
- You're...
- Whiskey.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.411
Sam Whiskey.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.705
Something wrong?

09:00.248 --> 09:01.750
Please come in.

09:04.127 --> 09:07.130
You are the lady
that tipped me the telegraph

09:07.213 --> 09:10.467
about if I did something for you,
you'd give me $5,000?

09:10.550 --> 09:13.720
Please forgive me. Priscilla just died.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.139
- Priscilla?
- My bird.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.225
That's a shame.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.644
Would you bury her?

09:20.727 --> 09:23.730
Lady, I didn't come 400 miles
to bury your bird.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.649
Of course not.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.735
Have you ever heard
of the Pinkerton Detective Agency?

09:29.611 --> 09:33.448
Yeah, sort of.
I shot Ben Pinkerton in the leg one time.

09:33.782 --> 09:37.285
Yeah. He was runnin'
a spy service for the Union army.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.246
- It was an accident.
- It must've been.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.415
His agency highly recommended you.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.625
That's good.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.377
Mr. Whiskey...

09:45.585 --> 09:46.878
Mr. Whiskey.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.882
There's a quarter of a million dollars
in gold bars

09:51.007 --> 09:54.636
<i>sunk on the bottom of the Platte River
in the steamboat Bonnie Blue.</i>

09:54.719 --> 09:55.929
My husband stole it.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.431
You got yourself
a very enterprising husband.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.058
Had. He's dead.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.142
Oh, sorry.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.270
He took it from the United States Mint
in Denver, Colorado,

10:04.396 --> 10:07.357
and I want you to put it back in the mint.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.943
You want me to put it back in the mint?

10:09.984 --> 10:11.194
That's right.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.408
Lady, there's two things
I don't mess around with,

10:16.449 --> 10:17.909
one is an Apache squaw,

10:17.951 --> 10:19.828
and the other
is the United States government.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.289
Mr. Whiskey, there is a senator,
a former governor,

10:23.373 --> 10:25.667
and two generals in our family.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.002
We have one
of the oldest names in Oklahoma.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.754
Well, that's wonderful.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.966
Why don't you tell them to bury your dead
bird and I'll just go on about my business.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.635
Because, Mr. Whiskey,
if that gold isn't returned,

10:35.719 --> 10:37.804
I'm the one who will have to go to jail.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.724
And I'd rather die first.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.184
You should've thought about that
before you got yourself involved.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.937
I should have, but I didn't.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.398
If I was the President, lady,
and you stole the White House

10:48.481 --> 10:51.151
and both halls of Congress,
I'd only give you six months.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.945
But if I don't keep myself out of jail,
nobody else will.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.824
Haven't you ever found yourself involved
in things where there was no way out?

10:57.866 --> 11:00.952
You didn't want it,
and you didn't approve of it, but...

11:00.994 --> 11:03.830
...there was just nothing else you could do.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.416
Yeah. But this ain't one of them times.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.877
Can I ask you just one favor?

11:08.960 --> 11:12.672
Let me tell you how it happened
before you say no.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.425
All right. But you're wasting your time.

11:16.968 --> 11:21.473
I married Phillips Breckenridge when
he was a promising young congressman.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.727
He seemed honest and principled,
courageous, clever.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.604
My mother didn't like him.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.189
She warned me,

11:29.230 --> 11:33.735
but I wanted to live in Washington,
see all the excitement of the Capitol.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.529
Phillips was very ambitious.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.949
When the opportunity presented itself
to become famous overnight,

11:40.033 --> 11:41.701
he grabbed it.

11:41.785 --> 11:45.997
He borrowed enough gold from the mint
to finance a rebellion in lower California.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.585
The result would've been a new republic,
the same way Texas began,

11:50.710 --> 11:53.505
with my husband
as first president of that republic.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.465
But the riverboat sank. Now I gotta go.

11:55.590 --> 11:59.344
The agents of Benito Juarez
didn't want another piece of Mexico lost,

11:59.385 --> 12:03.306
and expansion is no longer
a popular word in Washington.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.308
There's a new administration.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.316
Well, we've had a nice talk,
lady, and I hope you get...

12:13.399 --> 12:14.651
No. Mr. Whiskey!

12:14.734 --> 12:17.403
When they start minting coins
in Denver next month,

12:17.445 --> 12:21.491
I don't want them to discover the lead bars
Phillips put back in place of the gold.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.243
Yeah, you have got yourself a problem.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.870
Don't be so hasty!

12:25.912 --> 12:28.248
Look inside, Mr. Whiskey.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.666
What do you see?

12:30.792 --> 12:36.381
Instead of the 5,000,
I'm prepared to pay you $7,500,

12:36.422 --> 12:37.924
if you'll do it.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.928
How 'bout 10,000?

12:42.679 --> 12:47.100
Do you know there's 14 different kinds
of river pirates and bushwhackers

12:47.183 --> 12:49.269
between here and the Platte River?

12:49.310 --> 12:51.646
Pinkerton said you could do anything.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.565
He did?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.442
And now I'm sure of it.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.614
What would happen,
when I got that pile of gold,

13:01.698 --> 13:03.825
if I just kept it for myself?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.952
Uncle Morgan would have you shot.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.621
Uncle Morgan?

13:08.705 --> 13:11.207
He's the General in the family.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.837
Well, I've thought it all over...

13:16.671 --> 13:19.340
<i>...and I think I'll just be on my way.</i>

13:21.342 --> 13:23.761
You certainly have got
an active disposition.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.389
-12,500.
- No!

13:26.472 --> 13:27.724
I can't handle it.

13:27.807 --> 13:32.103
I can see right now it's gonna take
at least two more men besides myself.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.647
$15,000.

13:35.690 --> 13:41.154
Mr. Whiskey, that is absolutely
all I have to pay you.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.697
Please say you'll do it.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.157
Please?

13:51.205 --> 13:56.669
<i>I'll pay you half the 20,000 now,
and the other half when you've finished.</i>

13:56.711 --> 13:59.047
I'm damn near finished already.

14:00.214 --> 14:03.301
You have no idea how much better I feel

14:03.343 --> 14:05.678
knowing with your help,
I won't have to go to prison.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.180
Yeah.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.849
I just hope it isn't the other way around.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.103
I think it's wonderful chivalry isn't dead.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.023
- You don't mind if I count it, do you?
- Of course not.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.860
<i>Now, the Bonnie Blue went down
in that narrow channel,</i>

14:20.902 --> 14:23.029
right there where the arrow's pointing.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.824
I'll meet you on the road between there
and Denver a week from today.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.534
By then, you should have the gold,

14:28.618 --> 14:31.412
and I should have the blueprints
of the mint for you.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.872
Good luck.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.666
LWlneedit

14:34.707 --> 14:36.376
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.089
Mr. Whiskey?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.467
It was nice doing business with you.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.682
Likewise, Mrs. Breckenridge.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.893
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.928
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.433
You own this shop?

15:33.558 --> 15:35.018
Nope.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.355
This your horse?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.606
Yep.

15:44.027 --> 15:47.321
Did you ever see
a Presbyterian wrestle a bear?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.823
Nope.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.829
I'll bet you didn't know President
Rutherford B. Hayes had a glass eye.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.790
What the hell do you want?

15:59.375 --> 16:00.918
How'd you like to go to work for me?

16:01.669 --> 16:02.879
Nope.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.136
That's $100.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.015
Bet you can't lift that anvil.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.788
On one leg.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.295
Doggone! You did it!

16:45.296 --> 16:46.839
You win the bet.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.092
Now how'd you like to help me get
a quarter of a million dollars

16:49.175 --> 16:51.844
worth of gold bars off the bottom
of the Platte River?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.683
How'd you like to help me get a quarter
of a million dollars-worth of gold bars

16:57.725 --> 16:59.227
off the bottom of the Platte River?

16:59.310 --> 17:00.311
Just you and me?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.438
No, I'm figuring on picking up
a friend along the way.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.816
- I'll think about it.
- Good.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.276
You can leave that here.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.451
Sam!

17:33.761 --> 17:34.929
Good luck.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.180
Thanks.

17:50.403 --> 17:54.198
<i>Mary McCarty was shy as a primrose</i>

17:54.240 --> 17:57.743
<i>Skin was as fair as the dew of the May</i>

17:57.785 --> 18:01.539
<i>And though she was tempted
she never surrendered</i>

18:01.664 --> 18:05.251
<i>Her virtue more often
than four times a day</i>

18:05.334 --> 18:07.086
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

18:07.170 --> 18:08.921
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

18:08.963 --> 18:10.715
<i>Mary McCarty loved whiskey and...</i>

18:10.798 --> 18:12.592
I knew a man named George one time.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.801
Used to sing a lot.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.052
They hanged him.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.512
Is that a fact?

18:16.596 --> 18:17.638
Yep.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.640
I knew a wheelwright named Abercrombie.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.392
Looked a whole lot like you.

18:22.185 --> 18:25.146
Had two wives
back in Frackville, Pennsylvania.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.024
One was a Mormon lady.
The other a Baptist.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.650
I used to work for him.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.403
He paid me 25 cents an hour
to make wagon wheels.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.281
I'll tell you something else,
he was mean as hell.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.743
Abercrombie went into the Army
as a captain.

18:38.784 --> 18:42.580
First battle he got into,
an enlisted man named Tom shot him.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.790
That doesn't sound like an accident.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.542
I wouldn't know.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.795
Well, go on! What happened next?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.422
When the war was over,

18:51.464 --> 18:53.883
Tom went to Frackville
and married Abercrombie's widow,

18:53.966 --> 18:55.468
the Baptist one.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.637
I'll be damned.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.348
What happened to the Mormon widow?

19:00.431 --> 19:01.807
Went out west.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.060
Started her own wagon wheel business.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.313
Married an apothecary, had seven children.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.900
Was the first lady to win
the blue ribbon for rhubarb pies

19:10.983 --> 19:12.985
three years runnin'.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.528
Tell me something, Jed.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.697
Do you know all that for a fact?

19:16.781 --> 19:18.824
Just thought it up as I went along.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.159
Helped pass the time.

19:23.579 --> 19:27.667
<i>The girls in the city are skinny and pretty</i>

19:27.750 --> 19:31.045
<i>Girls in the country
have meat on their bones</i>

19:31.420 --> 19:35.758
<i>But Mary McCarty
could give them all lessons</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:39.804
<i>In loving contortions and delicate moans</i>

19:39.887 --> 19:41.722
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

19:41.847 --> 19:43.683
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

19:43.766 --> 19:47.603
<i>Mary McCarty loved whiskey and gin</i>

19:55.987 --> 19:58.322
I'll tell you what, Samuel.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.700
You gotta adjust this thing
to fit your own eye.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.368
Now, you were shootin' low out there,

20:02.451 --> 20:07.206
so we'll put that front side
right about there for you.

20:07.290 --> 20:10.459
Takes a little time,
but once you get the hang of it...

20:15.840 --> 20:17.675
I'll be damned.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.886
Built it all myself, Sam.
Fires 300 rounds a minute.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.597
The British gun Hotchkiss
fires 200 rounds a minute

20:23.681 --> 20:25.433
and weighs 10 pounds more.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.519
- The French have got a gun...
- You come with a gun, O.W.?

20:30.563 --> 20:34.859
Samuel, I...
Dat gum it, Sam, you know why.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.986
I've been trying to discipline myself.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.572
I'm through with all that chasm' around.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.991
I'm an inventor and a businessman now.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.701
Wouldn't change your mind, would you?

20:43.743 --> 20:46.120
No, sir. No, lwouldn't.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.247
I'll take you in on shares.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.916
You, me, and Jed there.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.587
Shares?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.339
What's this?

20:56.422 --> 20:58.257
Automatic corn sheller.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.095
I'll sell you the guns, Sam.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.388
But that's all.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.474
- That's all?
- That's right.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.351
Well, the least you can do
is give us some supper.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.853
Already got it on the stove cookin'.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.825
A little something to wet the whistle with.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.786
- Is that com?
- Yeah.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.579
<i>If you don't mind, I'll stick to rye.</i>

21:28.662 --> 21:30.623
Sure. Go right ahead.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.292
- Jed, you a poker player?
- Nope.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.961
- You wanna learn?
- No, I don't.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.840
Well, I can't says I blame you.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.676
Jed, did I ever tell you that O.W. here

21:42.760 --> 21:45.554
was the hardest drinkin',
hardest fightin' man

21:45.638 --> 21:47.348
that General Sherman ever had?

21:47.431 --> 21:49.100
Nope.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.851
<i>Salud, amigos.</i>

21:50.935 --> 21:54.313
- Salud.
- To old times.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.321
I don't suppose you'd have any trouble

22:02.446 --> 22:04.782
figurin' out a way a man
could do some work under water

22:04.824 --> 22:06.826
at, say, 15 or 20 feet, would you?

22:06.909 --> 22:09.412
Work 15 or 20 feet under water?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.331
I suppose a good size bucket,

22:12.373 --> 22:14.708
some leather hose
and a bellows oughta do it.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.085
Why? What do ya got in mind?

22:18.212 --> 22:19.964
You remember the time you won $100

22:20.005 --> 22:22.174
bettin' how far
you could throw a cannonball?

22:22.216 --> 22:24.301
Yeah.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.929
I can't do that kind of stuff anymore.
I got a hitch in my back.

22:27.179 --> 22:32.518
Oh, I bet you could still outdrink old Jed
and I here put together, if you wanted to.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.728
<i>Salud.</i>

22:35.646 --> 22:37.648
Well, yeah, I probably could, but...

22:37.690 --> 22:41.652
...that kind of stuff doesn't fit in with being
an inventor and a businessman.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.571
Yeah.

22:43.654 --> 22:47.658
Must take a lot of hard-earned cash to
come up with one of those inventions, huh?

22:47.700 --> 22:48.868
Yeah, it sure does.

22:48.951 --> 22:52.788
Did I tell you that, after expenses,
your share will come to well over $5,000?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.874
Over $5,000?

22:54.957 --> 22:56.417
Over $5,000.

22:58.002 --> 23:00.129
- Bet ten cents.
- Salud.

23:03.549 --> 23:04.884
Well, what do ya got?

23:06.218 --> 23:07.553
What do ya got?

23:07.636 --> 23:08.888
Pair of nines and fives.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.891
One pair. You win.

23:14.518 --> 23:18.564
You figure, a hose
and a bucket'll do it, huh?

23:18.647 --> 23:21.192
Well, I can't say for sure till it's tried.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.318
Yeah.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.237
What kind of work
you gonna do underwater?

23:25.321 --> 23:27.740
We're gonna haul up
a quarter of a million dollars in gold bars

23:27.781 --> 23:29.575
off the bottom of the Platte River.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.579

24:02.816 --> 24:04.610

24:07.905 --> 24:10.950
You know, O.W., once your head clears up

24:11.033 --> 24:14.119
and you get some
of that cottonwood smell in your lungs,

24:14.161 --> 24:15.496
you'll feel great.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.149
Sam, stop this wagon.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.734
Sorry, O.W. I can't do it.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.152
Sam, I'm tellin' ya to...

24:47.194 --> 24:49.780
We got a lot of work ahead,
and not much time to do it in.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.824
Your share of the money's in your boot.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.867
Just like I told you, we're partners.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.543
Ain't we?

25:05.379 --> 25:07.339
What the hell are you doin'?
Let go of that wheel.

25:07.381 --> 25:09.133
I wanna talk to you, Sam.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.026
- Can't it wait?
- No, it can't.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.699
What's the matter with you? You damn
near caused the wagon to turn over.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.451
It's my wagon, ain't it?

25:39.163 --> 25:40.998
Look, we're partners, ain't we?

25:41.040 --> 25:44.335
Sam, I'm a man
who hates to lose his temper.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.215
I suppose what you're trying to tell me

25:50.299 --> 25:52.217
is that you could knock me on my can
if you wanted to.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.552
I figure!

25:56.722 --> 26:01.894
I suppose you think what happened
last night was a dirty trick on a friend.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.479
I sure do!

26:06.732 --> 26:08.317
All right, then. Hit me.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.236
I don't wanna hit you.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.198
No, go on. Hit me.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.742
Wouldn't be half enough
for what I did to you.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.118
Go on. Hit me.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.915
<i>I'll tell you what... You hit me.</i>

26:34.301 --> 26:35.761
Tryin' to trick you into a deal

26:35.803 --> 26:39.223
where you make a lot of money
so you can become a rich man.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.225
Become a famous inventor.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.227
A man oughta be stoned for that.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.312
Hit me again.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.106
Now, I deserve it.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.867
It don't make sense...

26:58.951 --> 27:01.453
Letting a man get away
with a thing like that.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.125
Ain't no punishment bad enough

27:06.166 --> 27:10.129
for a man who'd
pull a dirty trick like that on a friend.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.342
Well, O.W.?

27:18.303 --> 27:19.471
Let's go.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.312
Jed?

27:28.355 --> 27:29.440
Thanks?

27:29.982 --> 27:31.275
Any time, Sam.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.737
Git up. Come on.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.561
Go ahead and pump.

28:10.439 --> 28:11.857
How's it feel?

28:11.982 --> 28:14.485
Not as good as a new Stetson hat.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.684
Evenin'.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.770
Well, howdy, neighbor.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.364
Did you ever see a man
run with his throat cut?

29:00.405 --> 29:01.698
Not lately.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.499
Nothing in here looks like a map.

29:11.124 --> 29:14.419
- Where is it?
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.922
The map. Where is it?

29:17.172 --> 29:18.423
Look, you out my throat,

29:18.507 --> 29:20.676
and I won't know what the hell
you're talkin' about!

29:20.759 --> 29:22.553
Where is it?

29:22.636 --> 29:24.930
I can't think with that knife in my throat!

29:26.598 --> 29:27.766
Is that better?

29:27.808 --> 29:28.892
Sam.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.018
Yeah?

29:30.102 --> 29:32.604
I think I know
what they might be looking for!

29:33.230 --> 29:36.608
All right, then you tell me
what the hell they're lookin' for!

29:36.692 --> 29:39.444
That chart you got
under the books in the wagon!

29:44.283 --> 29:45.784
There's nothin' in here.

29:46.660 --> 29:47.786
Hey, Jack.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.455
I think your friend is playing games with us.

29:50.998 --> 29:53.292
Why don't you just stick
your shotgun in his snoot

29:53.333 --> 29:55.836
and let's see how far he splatters.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.922
Maybe it'll help his friend
remember about the map.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.004
Where in damnation were you?

30:40.130 --> 30:41.298
Who? Me?

30:42.841 --> 30:44.176
I was right here.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.845

31:33.976 --> 31:35.727
The river's just up ahead!

31:48.323 --> 31:50.117
There it is, gentlemen!

31:51.326 --> 31:53.829
<i>The last remains
of the steamboat Bonnie Blue.</i>

31:54.913 --> 31:58.250
And you want me to swim out there
with a bucket on my head,

31:58.333 --> 32:01.169
go down in 15 feet of water,

32:01.253 --> 32:03.588
and fish around for some old box?

32:05.257 --> 32:08.135
I don't see anything unreasonable
about that. You, O.W.?

32:08.885 --> 32:10.387
Not offhand.

32:10.512 --> 32:13.098
- Then you do it.
- I can't swim.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.266
Say, friend!

32:14.808 --> 32:18.020
Would you mind rowing to shore
a minute? I'd like to talk to ya!

32:19.104 --> 32:22.941
O.W., think we oughta
spend some of our money and,

32:23.025 --> 32:25.736
buy Jed here a boat
so he don't have to do any swimmin'?

32:25.819 --> 32:27.237
Well, if you're gonna work in the water,

32:27.279 --> 32:29.698
a boat's a pretty handy item
to have around.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.450
I'd say it's a good investment.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.951
Couldn't agree more.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.875
- Howdy, friend.
- Howdy.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.963
How'd you like to sell that boat?

32:45.047 --> 32:47.174
How much you gimme for it?

32:47.257 --> 32:50.552
$10 for the boat,
2 for the fish, and 2 for the jug.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.345
Don't see why you want a boat for.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.848
You can't take that wagon across on it.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.726
Well, don't you worry none
about that, friend.

32:57.851 --> 32:59.770
We're just good-natured rich folk.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.980
Wanna do a little fishin' and drinkin'.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.318
Cousin Leroy made this.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.070
Have a bite out of it.

33:08.570 --> 33:09.571
Thanks.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.411
<i>I'll tell you what,</i>

33:16.495 --> 33:20.040
I'll give ya 15 for the boat,
and you keep the whiskey.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.501
Five...

33:23.502 --> 33:24.836
Ten...

33:25.545 --> 33:26.713
Fifteen.

33:27.881 --> 33:32.385
<i>Mary McCarty had one simple failing</i>

33:32.469 --> 33:36.681
<i>She liked to love men
three or four at a time</i>

33:38.266 --> 33:41.728
<i>Mary McCarty jumped over the table</i>

33:42.854 --> 33:46.358
<i>She liked to be chased
in the days of her prime</i>

33:46.858 --> 33:48.944
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

33:49.027 --> 33:50.695
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

33:50.821 --> 33:53.532
<i>Mary McCarty loved whiskey and gin</i>

33:54.407 --> 33:55.826
Good-natured rich folk

33:55.867 --> 33:57.786
who just wanna do
a little fishin' and drinkin'?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.287
That's what he said.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.832
'Course, I ain't never seen fishin'
done like that before.

34:02.582 --> 34:05.335
I wonderjust how rich they are.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.212
All right.

34:07.254 --> 34:09.965
Follow the smokestack down
till you get to the main deck.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.300
Then you look in the first cabin
on the right-hand side.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.553
If you get in trouble, yank on this.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.565
You all right, Jed?

34:26.606 --> 34:27.774
Yep.

34:27.858 --> 34:29.400
Nice river to get drowned in.

34:29.442 --> 34:30.485
Not too muddy.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.239
Down you go!

35:20.202 --> 35:21.703
I've seen enough.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.623
Let's go.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.578
Jed?

36:10.835 --> 36:11.920
Yeah.

36:22.472 --> 36:24.724
I wonder if we shouldn't have
a larger bellows.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.643
Or perhaps more sense.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.604
What's the matter, don't you wanna be
a rich man? Never have to work again?

36:29.688 --> 36:31.564
I like work. Enjoy it.

36:31.648 --> 36:35.527
All right, three or four pretty girls buzzin'.

36:35.652 --> 36:36.987
A homely girl'll treat you better.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.822
You know, Jed, you're right.

36:38.863 --> 36:42.158
I remember Plato quoting Socrates
as saying about the same thing.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.619
Takin' a chance with your life
for more money than you need

36:44.703 --> 36:46.413
is just plain foolishness.

36:46.496 --> 36:47.539
Is that a fact?

36:47.622 --> 36:51.960
Don't tell me you never heard
of the pure and clean greed for gold.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.420
That's what makes the world go round.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.046
I've heard it said.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.632
Now, what the hell's that
supposed to mean?

36:57.799 --> 36:59.592
D'you know that two parts permanganate,

36:59.676 --> 37:02.304
three parts of sulfur,
and one part of lard will...

37:04.139 --> 37:05.515
...kill hookworms?

37:06.099 --> 37:08.852
If that stuff isn't worth riskin'
your neck for, why don't you wait around

37:08.935 --> 37:11.396
till you get to heaven
for your reward, and I'll keep your share.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.606
<i>No. I'll save it,</i>

37:13.690 --> 37:17.402
have a family of my own,
and buy my own bathtub.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.912
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

37:28.079 --> 37:30.332
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

37:30.498 --> 37:32.542
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

37:32.625 --> 37:34.586
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

37:34.669 --> 37:36.588
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

37:36.671 --> 37:38.548
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

37:38.590 --> 37:40.884
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

37:40.925 --> 37:42.969
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

37:43.053 --> 37:45.597
<i>She's a jolly good fellow</i>

37:45.638 --> 37:48.808
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

37:52.771 --> 37:54.814
Listen, Big Annie, this man here,

37:54.939 --> 37:57.692
he's got some business
you just might be interested in.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.943
Business?

37:59.069 --> 38:00.737
How d'you do, ma'am?

38:00.779 --> 38:03.573
I'd like the help
of some of your boys for shares.

38:03.698 --> 38:06.326
- Shares? Shares of what?
- Listen, Big Annie.

38:06.451 --> 38:09.454
<i>He says there was gold on the Bonnie
Blue when she sank in the channel.</i>

38:09.496 --> 38:11.122
- Gold.
- Yeah.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.416
You'll get 10% for your share in helping.

38:17.754 --> 38:21.424
Listen, honey, I don't do nothin' for 10%.

38:24.344 --> 38:31.309
But I'd be glad to have my boys go along
with a nice, fat man like you 50/50 split.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.717
Put your hands up!

39:48.386 --> 39:49.512
Put 'em up!

39:51.264 --> 39:54.934
The next one's liable to kill ya!
Now, put 'em up!

40:01.441 --> 40:02.484
I've found it!

40:53.117 --> 40:54.202
Get outta the way!

40:58.081 --> 40:59.749
Get him, Tom. Go on, get him!

41:24.440 --> 41:27.986
What would Plato, Socrates,
and them people have to say about this?

41:28.903 --> 41:30.071
I wish I knew.

41:30.530 --> 41:33.658
Maybe they've never been
in quite this situation.

41:48.548 --> 41:50.758
That's it. The last one.

41:50.842 --> 41:53.845
Well, boys, I'd say we had ourselves a day.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.264
<i>Let's go in and have some supper.</i>

42:06.733 --> 42:09.235
That feller that drowned,

42:09.360 --> 42:11.696
he said my whiskey were no good, huh?

42:12.572 --> 42:16.576
Well, he was just a poor judge
of the finer things in life.

42:18.828 --> 42:21.998
You know what Fat Man and me
is gonna do to you after dinner?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.502
We gonna slice you up a little.

42:27.587 --> 42:28.921
Both of ya.

42:30.173 --> 42:32.550
And you know what we're gonna do?

42:33.301 --> 42:35.637
We're gonna cut your buttons off,

42:35.720 --> 42:38.389
and just watch you hop around and holler.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.391
That's what we gonna do.

42:41.017 --> 42:42.435
You know somethin', O.W.?

42:43.061 --> 42:45.104
I don't think he likes us.

42:46.689 --> 42:49.567
Haul! Haul!

42:50.234 --> 42:51.903
Put your backs into it.

42:52.695 --> 42:55.365
That's more like it. Haul!

42:57.075 --> 42:58.743
I had that guy...

42:58.785 --> 43:01.412
To hear you talk, Stanley,
you'd think you'd done all the fightin'!

43:01.537 --> 43:03.039
I had a hold of him, didn't I?

43:03.081 --> 43:06.417
<i>You got more pollywog blood in you
than fightin' blood! I'll tell you that!</i>

43:06.501 --> 43:09.003
- All he did was ride.
- I got a crick in my neck.

43:09.087 --> 43:10.088
Ready?

43:11.714 --> 43:12.882
Ready.

43:35.113 --> 43:37.782
"Presented to O.W. Bandy

43:37.907 --> 43:40.910
"by his loving parents, Jonah and Ruth.

43:41.703 --> 43:45.289
"Have mercy upon us, Oh, Lord.

43:45.373 --> 43:50.503
"Consider my trouble which I suffer
at the hands of them who hate me."

43:50.628 --> 43:53.339
13th verse, 9th Psalm.

43:53.464 --> 43:56.634
"Have mercy upon us, oh, Lord.

43:56.801 --> 44:02.640
"Thou that lifteth me up
from the gates of death."

44:04.142 --> 44:07.228
Gentlemen, they're all yours.

45:08.372 --> 45:11.042
Say, you know, I think maybe
Sam didn't drown after all.

45:11.083 --> 45:15.463
Either that, or that's the liveliest pair
of underwear I have ever seen.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.723
Sure is lovely stuff.

45:27.558 --> 45:28.726
Sure is.

45:29.977 --> 45:32.396
O.W.! Let's get goin'!

46:11.519 --> 46:15.022
Well, that way is Denver.

46:17.817 --> 46:19.569
And that way is Mexico.

46:25.533 --> 46:27.201
Mr. Whiskey!

46:32.331 --> 46:33.374
Hi.

46:35.543 --> 46:36.669
Hiya.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.129
Hello.

46:38.796 --> 46:41.799
Mr. Whiskey, hi!

46:49.724 --> 46:53.728
Tell me something. You had much trouble
finding us here in the middle of nowhere?

46:53.811 --> 46:58.190
Calculations. A lady has ways
of making calculations.

46:58.274 --> 46:59.984
You like my perfume?

47:01.068 --> 47:05.197
Well, I don't pay much attention to
that kind of stuff during business hours.

47:05.281 --> 47:06.824
Of course you don't.

47:06.866 --> 47:11.203
Now, would a blueprint of the mint be
something you would pay attention to?

47:11.287 --> 47:12.455
I might.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.665
And if I showed you some photographs?

47:14.749 --> 47:16.083
That'd be nice.

47:17.001 --> 47:19.837
Now, this is the mint building
from the outside.

47:19.879 --> 47:21.631
And these are the architectural plans.

47:21.672 --> 47:24.342
Uncle Morgan buys them
from the Treasury Department.

47:25.676 --> 47:28.846
You know, that gold must weigh
damn near a thousand pounds.

47:28.888 --> 47:30.681
How do you think I'm gonna get it
through the front door,

47:30.723 --> 47:32.600
carry it in my back pocket?

47:33.392 --> 47:36.354
This is the floor plan of the vault room.

47:36.395 --> 47:37.772
I'll tell ya somethin' else,

47:37.855 --> 47:41.108
you know we damn near
got killed twice since we left Pawnee?

47:41.317 --> 47:43.986
I'll bet that was Fat Henry Hobson.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.988
Somehow, he found out about that gold

47:46.030 --> 47:48.324
and has been trying to get
his hands on it ever since.

47:48.366 --> 47:51.869
What do you mean? Why the hell didn't
you tell me about Fat Henry Hobson?

47:51.953 --> 47:53.871
I wasn't sure he was still at it.

47:53.955 --> 47:56.958
And, besides, I knew you could
take care of anything that happened.

47:57.041 --> 47:59.210
Wonderful.
How'd you know that?

47:59.251 --> 48:00.753
Well, because I do.

48:00.836 --> 48:05.383
Just like I know you can take care of those
extra guards they've assigned to the mint.

48:05.466 --> 48:08.135
- What extra guards?
-well, they always do that just...

48:08.219 --> 48:10.638
What the hell you talkin' about,
extra guards?

48:10.721 --> 48:13.516
Before they have minting,
they put on extra guards,

48:13.557 --> 48:16.852
and I just found out about it.

48:16.894 --> 48:19.855
Look, lady, maybe you think
I don't mind going to prison for 20 years,

48:19.897 --> 48:22.316
but what about my friends
back there, O.W. and Jed?

48:22.400 --> 48:24.944
Honey, I know you can manage.
All you have to do is put your mind...

48:25.069 --> 48:27.446
All I have to do is get
the hell outta this buggy,

48:27.571 --> 48:29.156
give you back your money, and quit.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.076
Bushwhackers, extra guards,
what the hell you gonna do...

48:32.243 --> 48:35.287
If you just let me show you the plans.
I've got the blueprints.

48:35.371 --> 48:39.083
Sam, I know you can figure out
a way. You promised.

48:40.376 --> 48:41.877
I did?

48:43.879 --> 48:49.385
Well, if I only knew exactly how many
guards there were on each floor.

48:49.427 --> 48:51.303
I could find out.

48:51.387 --> 48:53.055
Good.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.808
Only that doesn't solve getting in.

48:56.892 --> 48:59.895
Getting in. That's the problem.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.355
I know.

49:03.399 --> 49:05.026
Takes careful planning.

49:05.192 --> 49:06.777
It does.

49:06.861 --> 49:10.489
One little mistake, and we'll
regret it the rest of our lives.

49:10.573 --> 49:11.657
You're right.

49:11.782 --> 49:14.994
I can't afford to take
any unnecessary chances.

49:15.077 --> 49:16.412
I agree.

49:17.246 --> 49:19.749
Well, I'll figure out a way somehow.

49:19.790 --> 49:21.125
I know you will.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.437
I'll raise ya two gold bars.

49:47.068 --> 49:48.235
What's that?

49:48.319 --> 49:49.820
<i>Poulet Chateau.</i>

49:49.862 --> 49:51.822
I should've had some white wine.

49:53.324 --> 49:56.827
If you ever go to jail, lady, I bet
the warden's gonna ask you to marry him.

49:59.121 --> 50:01.999
And make you the chief cook
of the whole establishment.

50:04.335 --> 50:05.503
Cards?

50:08.964 --> 50:10.299
I'll take one.

50:15.346 --> 50:18.516
Sam, you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

50:20.476 --> 50:21.936
Did you cheat just then?

50:24.772 --> 50:28.442
Sam, it's not my gold.
It belongs to the U.S. men in Denver.

50:29.193 --> 50:30.361
Now, why do you cheat?

50:30.861 --> 50:34.406
Well, I may never get a chance again
to cheat for a pot that size.

50:35.741 --> 50:37.034
Gentlemen...

50:37.952 --> 50:39.537
Dinner is served.

50:59.974 --> 51:01.559
We shouldn't have much trouble.

51:01.600 --> 51:04.937
All we have to do is fight
half the United States Army, then...

51:05.104 --> 51:07.106
...fly in a window like a bird.

51:07.273 --> 51:09.650
With a quarter million dollars
worth of gold on your tail.

51:09.733 --> 51:11.235
Nothin' to it.

51:11.277 --> 51:12.361
Yeah.

51:21.704 --> 51:24.248
I'll go on to the hotel. You see
if you can find a blacksmith's shop.

51:24.331 --> 51:25.332
Git up.

51:54.862 --> 51:57.031
That looks like it'll do.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.700
Well, let's see if he's interested in money.

51:59.783 --> 52:00.951
Git up.

52:07.917 --> 52:09.335
- Howdy, friend.
- Howdy.

52:10.169 --> 52:11.754
Nice lookin' place you got here.

52:11.795 --> 52:13.756
Thank you.

52:13.797 --> 52:16.634
I was just wondering,

52:16.717 --> 52:19.220
you do your business cash or credit?

52:19.303 --> 52:20.471
<i>Cash.</i>

52:21.305 --> 52:22.473
Like this?

52:22.556 --> 52:24.225
That'll do.

52:24.308 --> 52:25.643
What kind of forge you got?

52:25.726 --> 52:26.852
Smithfield.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.982
You fellas want your horses shod?

52:32.149 --> 52:35.152
No, thanks.
My friend here is a smith himself.

52:35.194 --> 52:37.363
Wants to bend a little iron.

52:37.446 --> 52:38.530
Take him about a week.

52:38.614 --> 52:42.576
In my shop? I don't let nobody
mess around in my shop.

52:42.743 --> 52:45.955
You ever think about takin'
a vacation for a week? Goin' fishin'?

52:45.996 --> 52:48.999
You mean, and you do
the smithin' yourself?

52:49.041 --> 52:50.292
That's the idea.

52:50.334 --> 52:52.169
Well, I don't know.

52:52.253 --> 52:55.047
I just don't like
strangers usin' my tools.

52:55.172 --> 52:58.050
And... Mister...

52:58.175 --> 53:00.344
- You made yourself a deal!
- Fine!

53:00.469 --> 53:02.930
Now, you rest up. Do a little fishin'.

53:03.013 --> 53:04.306
We'll see you back here next Friday.

53:04.431 --> 53:06.684
You rest up and do some fishin'.

53:06.767 --> 53:11.188
Me, I'm gonna spend a whole week
down at Fanny Barton's place.

53:16.110 --> 53:17.736
How big is that bust of Washington?

53:18.153 --> 53:19.697
Life-size.

53:21.782 --> 53:25.035
What about this empty building next door
to the mint, how far away is it?

53:25.119 --> 53:30.291
Honey, if you're thinking about a tunnel,
there's no time.

53:30.374 --> 53:31.709
Why not?

53:31.750 --> 53:36.422
Well, I just found out the mint inspector's
coming in on the train tonight.

53:37.298 --> 53:38.382
Tonight?

53:38.549 --> 53:40.926
He starts checking day after tomorrow.

53:42.720 --> 53:46.056
- You know what I like about you?
- My $20,000.

53:46.140 --> 53:47.141
No.

53:47.891 --> 53:49.810
These little surprises.

53:49.893 --> 53:52.896
Just how in the hell am I supposed
to get the real gold into the mint

53:52.938 --> 53:55.733
and the phony gold out of the mint
in 48 hours?

53:55.774 --> 53:58.527
Darling, I have supreme confidence in you.

53:58.569 --> 53:59.987
That's wonderful.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.240
What time is the train due?

54:03.282 --> 54:04.825
Oh, not until 11:15.

54:06.577 --> 54:08.245
He's a new man.

54:08.329 --> 54:10.247
Never been to Denver before.

54:10.331 --> 54:12.333
His name is Thorston Bromley.

54:13.417 --> 54:14.835
Do you know what he looks like?

54:14.918 --> 54:17.713
Well, he's about your size.
Maybe a little smaller.

54:17.755 --> 54:18.964
He wears glasses.

54:49.620 --> 54:52.456
Wait, honey, I wanna talk to you!
I have to tell you something!

54:52.539 --> 54:53.832
Wait! I wanna talk to you!

54:54.416 --> 54:55.793
No!

54:56.210 --> 54:58.837
- I wanna talk to you!
- Leave me alone!

54:58.962 --> 55:00.297
- Leave me!
- Hold it.

55:00.339 --> 55:01.548
- Get out of the way!
- Please help me.

55:01.632 --> 55:04.218
Unhand her, sir. Leave the lady alone!

55:04.635 --> 55:06.220
Will you stop it!

55:06.303 --> 55:08.680
Thank you so much for helping me.

55:10.349 --> 55:12.851
The Garden Hotel, please.

55:12.935 --> 55:14.311
Yes, ma'am.

55:17.648 --> 55:18.982
So far so good.

55:20.484 --> 55:24.154
Say, Sam, what was it
I'm supposed to say again?

55:25.823 --> 55:28.659
Aha! I caught you trifling with my wife.

55:28.742 --> 55:32.830
Aha. I caught you trifling with my wife.

55:32.871 --> 55:36.291
Aha! I caught you trifling with my wife!

55:39.336 --> 55:41.046
I caught you trifling with my...

55:41.880 --> 55:44.258
Thank you so much, Mr. Bromley.

55:44.341 --> 55:46.218
Isn't that what you said your name was?

55:46.301 --> 55:47.636
That's right.

55:47.678 --> 55:50.764
Well, I'm quite sure you're safe now.

55:50.973 --> 55:54.184
Couldn't you stay with me
just a little longer?

55:55.853 --> 55:58.188
Only until my nerves settle down.

55:59.857 --> 56:01.358
Can I get you something?

56:01.400 --> 56:04.027
I have a business appointment.

56:04.194 --> 56:06.238
What kind of business appointment?

56:07.364 --> 56:12.119
I'll bet you're a traveling salesman
or something exciting like that.

56:12.202 --> 56:16.457
No, Madame. As a matter of fact,
I work for the United States government.

56:16.540 --> 56:19.543
The government! Isn't that marvelous?

56:19.585 --> 56:21.545
It must be fascinating work,

56:21.587 --> 56:24.715
traveling around
from one big city to another.

56:26.008 --> 56:28.218
Don't you ever get lonely?

56:28.469 --> 56:30.971
No. I play checkers a lot.

56:31.054 --> 56:33.390
I make friends quickly that way.

56:33.432 --> 56:35.601
Would you like
just a little bit more brandy?

56:35.726 --> 56:37.060
No, thank you.

56:37.144 --> 56:41.231
Maybe... Maybe you'd like
to lie down and rest for a while.

56:41.273 --> 56:43.066
No. I do have an appointment.

56:43.108 --> 56:44.818
I must get to my hotel and check in.

56:44.902 --> 56:47.237
- You can stay here!
- Here?

56:48.572 --> 56:50.073
In your room?

56:50.115 --> 56:52.075
I'd feel so much safer.

56:52.117 --> 56:55.078
And then, after you've rested for a while,

56:55.120 --> 56:58.290
and freshened up, if you like,

56:58.415 --> 56:59.750
we could play checkers!

57:02.544 --> 57:03.670
Or something.

57:05.881 --> 57:06.965
Well...

57:09.218 --> 57:10.969
I...

57:13.889 --> 57:16.934
No... Really, I shouldn't.

57:20.270 --> 57:21.563
Who could that be?

57:27.569 --> 57:29.571
I caught you foolin' around...

57:29.613 --> 57:32.449
- Me?
- Trifling around with my wife!

57:32.533 --> 57:35.160
Don't move or I'll...

57:38.872 --> 57:41.667
I guess I didn't do it so slick, huh?

57:41.750 --> 57:43.252
But effective.

57:44.836 --> 57:46.630
There. That does it.

57:46.713 --> 57:50.467
Now, don't breathe too deeply.
You'll pop your collar button.

57:50.551 --> 57:53.637
Don't worry, Mr. Bromley.
We won't break them.

57:53.845 --> 57:55.264
Damn tie.

57:56.098 --> 57:58.308
Don't know why a treasury man
has to wear a tie.

57:58.392 --> 58:02.062
What men won't do for money
and other considerations.

58:06.858 --> 58:08.151
Good luck.

58:08.235 --> 58:09.403
Yeah.

58:16.410 --> 58:18.453
Now, now, now.

58:18.495 --> 58:21.665
Everything's going to be all right.

58:21.707 --> 58:23.208
Here you are.

59:15.010 --> 59:17.054
Thorston Bromley. Bureau of the Mints.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.974
- We've been expecting you, Mr. Bromley.
- Thank you, sir.

59:21.058 --> 59:22.225
Briefcase.

59:24.227 --> 59:26.063
Regulation 18-C.

59:26.146 --> 59:28.148
And a very good regulation it is, sir.

59:34.363 --> 59:35.697
Mr. Perkins.

59:43.080 --> 59:46.458
Mr. Bromley, this is
the mint superintendent Mr. Perkins.

59:46.541 --> 59:48.543
- Glad to know you, Perkins.
- Bromley.

59:48.585 --> 59:51.088
- It is Thorston Bromley?
- Yes.

59:51.171 --> 59:53.090
Were you with
the department in Philadelphia?

59:53.131 --> 59:54.883
No.

59:54.966 --> 59:57.386
Very nice building, Perkins.

59:57.427 --> 59:59.429
- Very nice building.
- Thank you.

59:59.513 --> 01:00:00.764
Shall we get started?

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:03.183
Yes. Yes. We'll take the elevator.

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:09.356
Bromley, you know, I could've sworn
there was a Thorston Bromley...

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:13.110
I have to get finished here, Perkins,
and get on to our mint in Carson City.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.529
Yes. Of course.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.614
We'll start with the second floor.

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:27.457
By the way, I don't suppose you were
ever in Washington three years...

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:30.627
I haven't been to Washington in five years.

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:34.506
Tell me, how often do you
get this elevator serviced?

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:35.841
Every month.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.468
The rails need greasing.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:42.639
Well...

01:00:45.726 --> 01:00:47.310
To the right.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:50.689
We'll start with the vault
in the security room.

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.482
That'll be fine.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.326
That's the exit to the roof.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.753
Open up, corporal.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.337
May I see your weapon, please?

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:15.547
Thank you.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.760
- How many shifts on your post, corporal?
- Only one, sir.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:21.720
- What time do you start?
-8:00.

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:24.931
- What time do you finish?
- At 6:00, when the mint closes, sir.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.267
Very good. Sorry.

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.853
Your hammer spring needs tightening.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.860
Take that gun to ordnance
first thing in the morning.

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:38.779
Yes, sir.

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:18.360
Mr. Bromley?

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:21.404
Yeah.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.746
We're all ready to start minting that gold.

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:33.959
That is, as soon as you've
finished your inspection, of course.

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:36.419
That'll be fine.

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:45.387
Besides the smelting room,
the weights and measures

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:48.098
and the engraving room
are also down in the basement.

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:49.432
Very good.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:03.613
<i>Mary McCarty loved whiskey and gin</i>

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:05.991
Did you say something?

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:07.993
No. Just singing.

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.290
Here we are, Mr. Bromley.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:16.918
Of course, right now,
everything is at a standstill,

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.962
waiting for your go-ahead.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:20.505
Yes, I understand.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:29.014
These guards, you have
the personal histories on all of them?

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:32.309
Of course, Mr. Bromley.
That's standard procedure.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:35.020
I've been with the Bureau
of the Mint for 17 years, and...

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:37.939
Just checking, Perkins. I'm just checking.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:40.317
It's one of the pitfalls of my job.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.819
You start mistrusting people.

01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:45.155
- Yes, I...
- On the other hand...

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.617
That was my fault, Perkins.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.577
I don't know how that happened.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.662
Boys, would you give us a hand here?

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:53.830
I insist.

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:55.040
I'm sure it was my fault.

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:57.792
I insist. I tripped,
and I'm gonna have it fixed.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:04:02.380
- Really, Mr. Bromley, there's no need...
- Perkins, he's the Father of our Country.

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:07.177
We can't leave him with a broken nose.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:09.387
Can we?

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:10.639
Of course not.

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.021
Right this way, gentlemen.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.441
Right in here.

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:23.318
Easy does it.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.878
- Melting pot about ready?
- Just about.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.909
Make sure you get
that nose on straight, O.W.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.828
For the Father of our Country,
I'll do my best.

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:49.005
- Well?
- They're meltin' the gold!

01:06:49.089 --> 01:06:51.132
Meltin' the gold? What for?

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.510
All I know is I saw them melting it.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:59.265
As soon as the mold hardens, we'll take
old George out and pour new George in.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.028
Mr. Bromley?

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.202
Look what I brought you.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.740
O.W., you're an artist.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:00.994
His only mistake
was not being born in Paris, France.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.912
Gentlemen, it's nice...

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.748
...to be appreciated.

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:27.604
We'll wait until morning.
Let them finish whatever they're doing.

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.814
Then we'll decide how to handle it.

01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:49.500
No...

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.466
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.385
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.054
<i>Mary...</i>

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.100
Say, that is pretty, ain't it?

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:35.732
Git up.

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:45.158
<i>Easy as picking cherries.</i>

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.909
Go get us our wagon.

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.169
Hey, a little help here, please!

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.920
Give us a hand, will ya?

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:10.224
Easy does it, gentlemen.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.684
Easy does it.

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:13.436
Very carefully, please.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.606
All right.

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.517
This way.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.229
Nice job, men.

01:12:02.402 --> 01:12:03.486
Thank you.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:06.531
- Hello, Mr. Bromley.
- Hello, Perkins.

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:08.783
I brought your statue back
as good as new, I hope.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.827
I'm sure it is. I appreciate your trouble.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:13.413
- No trouble at all.
- Well!

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:14.997
Here we are.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:18.209
Let's... Let's get
to those coin reports, shall we?

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:19.460
Yes, of course.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:22.130
We should have everything
cleared up by tonight.

01:12:26.134 --> 01:12:29.345
You're really getting to know
your way around here, Mr. Bromley.

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:51.367
Say, it's a shame the way the plumbing
goes to pot in these government buildings.

01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:52.618
Yup.

01:12:57.206 --> 01:13:00.334
Hi, neighbor. It's all right, go right ahead.

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:09.051
Well, there they are, Mr. Bromley.

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:10.595
Waiting for you.

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:14.891
Now, if I can be of any assistance,
I'll be glad to stay around.

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:17.810
Or if you'd prefer to be by yourself,
whichever you wish.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:21.981
Why don't you stay around a little while
until I have a better look at these ledgers.

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.966
Perkins?

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:35.137
I've got about four more hours
of work to do here.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:43.271
Well, I wonder if you'll be wanting me
to stay any longer, Mr. Bromley.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:46.148
I must say, if all the mints
were run the way you run this one,

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:48.651
the bureau would be in excellent shape.

01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:49.860
Thank you.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:51.487
There's no need for you to stay.

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:52.822
Very good.

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:58.452
- Good night, Mr. Bromley.
- Good night, Perkins.

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:36.032
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:38.576
- Oh, Corporal?
- Sir?

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:40.328
What's going on in the lavatory?

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:43.122
I don't know, sir, but the workmen
seem to be taking care of it.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.541
- Where are they?
- Must've gone home, sir.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:47.835
Well...

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:25.206
Here's the key imprint
and the other things you asked for.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:28.250
Get the duplicate made.
I'll meet you on the rotunda.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.326
- Hank.
- Pete, how goes it?

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.787
Fine. Do me a favor,
next time you pass Henderson...

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:50.458
Henderson's not on duty tonight.
He traded with McGuffey.

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:52.626
Have McGuffey bring me some coffee.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:53.836
All right.

01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:55.337
- Sugar?
- Yeah.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.230
- Pete?
- Yeah?

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:55.898
McGuffey said to get your own coffee.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.359
- He did, did he?
- Yeah.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.069
What about the $4.00 I loaned him?

01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:01.445
He didn't mention it to me.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.578
Did you hear something?

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:11.914
It's the plumbing. They're workin' on it.

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:15.918
Tie it off.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:19.148
Hank, I'll get you a cup on my next round.

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:20.316
Thank you.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:40.753
You're relieved, Pete.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:42.379
Yeah.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:44.381
Thanks, Johnny.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.586
What's wrong?

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:26.173
Oh, nothing. I'm just not sleepy.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:28.717
That's good. Now go back to sleep.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:50.531
Hey, Pete...

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:52.825
- Here's your coffee.
- O.W.!

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.451
There wasn't any more sugar.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:57.121
Must be McGuffey. He uses
more sugar than any man I know.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:00.207
By the way, did you pass Joe
while you were on your round?

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:01.750
No. Why?

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:04.169
I wondered if he was using
the freight elevator.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.630
- That's against the rules.
- I know.

01:22:06.714 --> 01:22:09.508
- Well, Pete, enjoy your coffee.
- Thanks.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.460
Here's your key, Sam.

01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:45.711
See you later.

01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:57.324
Seven...

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:00.285
Nineteen...

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.047
Twenty-th...

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.884
No, that's not right. I'll start over.

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:20.597
Seven...

01:24:22.516 --> 01:24:24.184
Back to nineteen...

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:31.608
Seven...

01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:39.032
Twenty-fou r...

01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:56.091
Joe?

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:59.469
- Did you use the elevator a while ago?
- No, why?

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:02.222
Nothing.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.271
Seven...

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.136
- O.W.
- Yeah?

01:26:57.421 --> 01:26:59.506
I'm terribly sorry.

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:30.180
What's wrong? Can't you lie still?

01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:34.059
It's the plumbing.
Now, who ordered the plumbing fixed?

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:37.187
- Whose plumbing?
- My plumbing.

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:40.649
What do you mean? There's
nothing wrong with your plumbing.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:45.987
That's it! There is nothing wrong
with my plumbing.

01:28:46.029 --> 01:28:47.489
That's what's wrong!

01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:04.381
Sorry.

01:29:04.464 --> 01:29:06.258
That wasn't plumbing.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:07.551
Maybe the boiler room.

01:29:07.634 --> 01:29:10.178
No, it sounded more
like the smelting room.

01:30:53.073 --> 01:30:54.699
Nothing down there,

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:56.701
but Mac left the fire going in the forge.

01:30:56.785 --> 01:30:59.829
- Didn't you put it out?
- I didn't know if I should.

01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:01.164
<i>I'll do it.</i>

01:32:26.583 --> 01:32:29.586
Honesty is the best policy.

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:33.089
Stolen money burns a hole in your pocket.

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.051
Yeah.

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:16.424
Outta the way!

01:33:17.967 --> 01:33:20.637
Hank, take a look at this.
I found it in the smelting room.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:23.973
All of the men
in the smelting room wear caps.

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:27.268
You know those plumbers who were
here this afternoon, did anybody ever...

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:30.438
Where the hell is George Washington?

01:33:31.856 --> 01:33:33.024
We're being robbed!

01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:36.486
Hank, you cover the basement!
Pete, you come with me!

01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:38.571
Joe, sound the alarm!

01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:01.970
Come on, boy.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.740
- Halt!
- Jump!

01:34:21.865 --> 01:34:22.991
Corporal of the Guard!

01:35:03.615 --> 01:35:07.535
Mr. Perkins, this man claims
he's the treasury inspector.

01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:09.788
Yes, that's right.
My name is Bromley, I came...

01:35:09.871 --> 01:35:13.374
Bromley? Did... Did you say Bromley?

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:18.546
This is the damndest gold I ever seen.

01:35:26.012 --> 01:35:30.183
<i>Mary McCarty
has gone up to heaven</i>

01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:34.395
<i>She's mourned by her friends
at her untimely fate</i>

01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:38.817
<i>She perished one night
in the arms of a lover</i>

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:42.070
<i>And passed from this world</i>

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:44.072
<i>She was just 88</i>

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.574
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:48.535
<i>Whiskey and gin</i>

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:51.955
<i>Mary McCarty</i>

01:35:52.038 --> 01:35:54.707
<i>Loved whiskey and gin</i>

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:01.047
What's the name of the next town we hit?

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:04.175
Ludlow, Kansas.
We're due there at 6:00 p.m., sir.

01:36:04.259 --> 01:36:05.760
- Tell you what...
- Thank you.

01:36:05.885 --> 01:36:07.637
- Why don't you put...
- Yes, ma'am.

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.264
Three more hours to go.

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:11.641
<i>I don't know if I'll make it till then.</i>

01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:15.603
Sam, you can try.

01:36:15.645 --> 01:36:16.980
Can't you?
