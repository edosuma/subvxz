WEBVTT

00:00.689 --> 00:02.110
<i>Previously on The Shield...</i>

00:02.260 --> 00:03.689
We'll order some chinese food.

00:03.690 --> 00:06.244
Got a great bottle of wine
I've been waiting to open.

00:07.179 --> 00:09.875
Is this a date?
Do you want it to be?

00:10.156 --> 00:12.258
Looks like Moses finally made it
to the land of milk

00:12.357 --> 00:13.580
and underage honey.

00:20.909 --> 00:22.351
Lem, I'm sorry.

00:22.611 --> 00:24.268
But I had to, right?

00:28.011 --> 00:29.471
We're gonna find out who did this.

00:29.576 --> 00:30.696
And we're gonna kill him.

00:31.236 --> 00:32.645
Maybe he didn't do it, man.

00:32.804 --> 00:35.197
- If it wasn't Guardo, who else was it?
- Look at him, man.

00:35.291 --> 00:37.720
If he had a name, don't you think
he would've told us by now?

00:37.793 --> 00:40.031
Just means he was acting alone.

00:45.342 --> 00:47.054
- Who's jacket?
- This is Captain Hyatt.

00:47.131 --> 00:50.329
He used to be a rising star at INS.
He's ours starting next week.

00:50.402 --> 00:53.068
You're not adding anybody to my team
that I don't have approval of.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.697
He's not your addition,
he's your replacement.

01:07.888 --> 01:09.260
Come on, boys. Let's go.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.326
- Don't shoot.
- Hold your fire!

01:14.365 --> 01:16.442
It wasn't me. They got guns in there.

01:21.753 --> 01:24.552
- All right, give me the cliff notes.
- No read on how many inside.

01:24.603 --> 01:26.456
Can't get a visual. No one's talking.

01:26.489 --> 01:27.915
Any shots fired since you got here?

01:27.979 --> 01:30.032
Couple. Sounded semi-automatic.

01:43.427 --> 01:45.518
Vic, Kevin Hyatt, your replacement.

01:45.882 --> 01:46.498
Hey.

01:47.069 --> 01:48.172
Looks like I found the fun.

01:48.260 --> 01:50.173
Gang shoot-out.
Couple of shots fired.

01:50.216 --> 01:51.340
Called 10 minutes ago.

01:52.312 --> 01:54.791
Stay down.
Both of you.

01:57.333 --> 01:58.307
Go, go, go.

01:59.359 --> 02:00.960
Uh, did he just give me a timeout?

02:40.271 --> 02:42.074
Hey!
Let me see your hands!

02:42.601 --> 02:44.296
Now, asshole!

02:45.281 --> 02:47.666
- Shit.
- Jesus christ.

02:49.542 --> 02:51.325
One of them niners shot us up

02:51.389 --> 02:52.919
then took off.

02:54.023 --> 02:56.493
- Aah...
- Put some pressure on that, sweetheart, ok?

03:01.157 --> 03:03.307
Hey! Get your hands on your head!

03:03.384 --> 03:04.667
Right now.
Get your hands on your head!

03:04.731 --> 03:06.086
I can't, man. I can't move.

03:06.232 --> 03:06.822
Hey.

03:08.514 --> 03:10.724
I was getting splinters in my ass
sitting on the bench.

03:11.265 --> 03:12.668
Figured I'd chip in.

03:15.044 --> 03:17.543
Ash!
This one's not colored up.

03:17.633 --> 03:18.825
Keep him away from the one niners.

03:18.940 --> 03:19.568
I got it.

03:20.691 --> 03:22.471
C'mon, he had Lem's gun.

03:22.878 --> 03:24.835
It was in my trunk.
Probably just pulled it out.

03:24.912 --> 03:27.888
Tossing you out is bullshit
Doin'it for some cop in diapers.

03:28.016 --> 03:29.487
Probably squash this.

03:29.901 --> 03:31.878
How about some official introductions.

03:32.029 --> 03:33.817
This is a little out of hands right now.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.740
Shane Vendrell, Ronnie Gardocki,

03:35.803 --> 03:36.841
this is Kevin Hyatt.

03:37.059 --> 03:39.250
- How's it going?
- I'll take that.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.837
Listen, I heard about your boy.
Lemansky.

03:46.974 --> 03:50.803
I lost a partner on the border 3 years ago.
It's a bitch of a thing, and I'm sorry.

03:50.958 --> 03:52.847
Lem was more than a partner.

03:54.977 --> 03:56.652
Well, of course he was.

03:57.527 --> 03:59.647
- Listen, ride with me.
- You got it.

03:59.679 --> 04:02.358
I'll give you a rundown on the one niners
on the way to the Barn.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.639
I reassigned units to enforce
the one niner injunction.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.909
That should keep things to a low boil
until we know what we're dealing with.

04:20.110 --> 04:22.714
Having Hyatt around here
might be a good thing for you.

04:22.903 --> 04:25.244
Give you a chance to show
you can play well with others.

04:25.293 --> 04:28.037
It's a little late in the game
for me to win miss congeniality.

04:28.075 --> 04:28.691
What do you think?

04:28.581 --> 04:30.325
**** of the biz lads heard that

04:30.326 --> 04:33.048
the one niners were having a square dance.
Decided to crash.

04:33.392 --> 04:37.166
Hot shot hero learned street gang names
on his ride in. Likes to show off.

04:37.562 --> 04:38.573
I was about to tell Vic

04:38.574 --> 04:41.465
that you're gonna bring in your own guys
eventually expanding the team.

04:41.631 --> 04:42.848
What about Shane and Ronnie?

04:42.905 --> 04:44.392
Let's keep them on.

04:44.471 --> 04:47.266
I'd like two teams here under
Hyatt's supervision.

04:47.607 --> 04:49.248
There's not a lot of people
who can do this job.

04:49.249 --> 04:49.934
I know.

04:50.282 --> 04:53.434
That's why I set up an appeals panel

04:53.592 --> 04:56.695
to review your retirement.
They meet in two weeks.

04:56.753 --> 04:59.355
If the panel's convinced
that we need you...

05:00.408 --> 05:02.140
Acevedo will never support that.

05:02.222 --> 05:04.260
He's got a lot riding on the barn.

05:04.449 --> 05:06.961
And if you're not in charge,
he'll feel more comfortable.

05:07.733 --> 05:09.882
But if you want me to make that case,

05:09.947 --> 05:12.091
you have to show me
you can make it work.

05:12.618 --> 05:15.446
Listen, I gotta deal with this.
And I'll make it work.

05:24.331 --> 05:26.358
I gotta say, I'm a little confused.

05:27.685 --> 05:31.007
I lied to Mackey.
In 3 weeks, he's gone. Period.

05:31.753 --> 05:35.596
But if he knows that, he'll start working
some angle. Looking for loopholes.

05:35.662 --> 05:38.159
I'm trying to keep him
on his best behavior.

05:38.542 --> 05:40.195
Especially for your sake.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.483
Well, it's kind of cold.

05:43.941 --> 05:46.056
- What do you know about Vic?
- Rumours mostly.

05:46.228 --> 05:47.971
I know he's made an assload of arrests.

05:48.035 --> 05:50.876
And I know that two guys on his team
got dead in the last 3 years.

05:50.961 --> 05:53.188
Another went head-first
through a windshield.

05:55.873 --> 05:58.781
So if I'm banging down doors, I better
make sure Mackey's where I can see him.

05:58.871 --> 06:01.736
You'll be just fine as long as
he doesn't have a problem with you.

06:01.913 --> 06:04.293
Now I've taken care of that.
Have a seat.

06:05.068 --> 06:07.694
How about I start putting my
own team together now?

06:08.182 --> 06:10.041
Swing the numbers my way a little.

06:11.674 --> 06:13.675
We do have good cops around here.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.162
I'll think on it.

06:18.286 --> 06:20.132
- Everything ok?
- I'm fine.

06:20.424 --> 06:23.630
No, no, no. Stay.
Maybe you should all hear this.

06:25.429 --> 06:28.807
I feel really stupid for saying
this out loud, and

06:29.269 --> 06:32.993
normally, I don't even believe in this stuff,
but I woke up this morning,

06:33.396 --> 06:35.627
and i felt like I was given a message.

06:35.821 --> 06:37.107
What are you talking about?

06:37.560 --> 06:39.333
I had this dream last night.

06:39.568 --> 06:41.991
And we were all there
in our old backyard

06:42.104 --> 06:44.873
having a barbecue,
only it wasn't our old yard, you know,

06:45.102 --> 06:48.160
it was this beautiful place
by this precipice.

06:48.620 --> 06:50.011
And Lem was there.

06:50.208 --> 06:54.613
And he was wearing his usual jeans,
but he had on this pinstripe shirt,

06:54.714 --> 06:56.468
and his hair was shorter,

06:56.710 --> 06:59.212
and he was younger
like when I first met him.

06:59.659 --> 07:01.673
He was wrestling with one of you guys.
I don't remember which,

07:02.071 --> 07:03.430
but then he wanted

07:03.661 --> 07:06.969
burgers for you guys.
Really well done, no pink.

07:07.323 --> 07:10.849
The thing is,
when I turned to give him the burgers,

07:11.130 --> 07:13.727
he got really mad,
and he said I made them all wrong.

07:14.055 --> 07:16.559
I'd never seen him like that.
He was shouting.

07:17.335 --> 07:19.900
And then you came over to him,
and you said,

07:19.980 --> 07:22.454
it's all right. You'd learned to eat

07:22.582 --> 07:24.063
your burgers like that.

07:24.769 --> 07:26.487
Then he got really calm.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.408
And he said...

07:28.772 --> 07:31.745
Ok.
It's all gonna be ok.

07:33.997 --> 07:36.249
And then he stepped off the cliff,

07:36.776 --> 07:39.223
and he didn't go up or down,

07:39.299 --> 07:42.067
he just disappeared
into this, like, haze.

07:44.107 --> 07:45.338
I know this sounds crazy,

07:45.426 --> 07:47.430
but I think it was Lem.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.412
I think he wanted me
to tell you this story.

07:54.863 --> 07:57.416
Maybe it means that everything
is going to be ok.

07:57.961 --> 07:58.712
Right?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.258

08:13.613 --> 08:15.652
let it go, man. It's just a dream.

08:15.755 --> 08:18.733
Corrine knows we've all been hurting lately.
Thought it would give us some confidence.

08:18.811 --> 08:19.519
Just go with it.

08:19.607 --> 08:22.440
He didn't disappear up in the sky.
He disappeared sideways.

08:22.514 --> 08:24.089
How is that comforting?

08:32.994 --> 08:34.748
He lost friends today.

08:35.424 --> 08:38.099
You lead with that. Don't show sympathy.

08:38.265 --> 08:40.123
Gang bangers see weakness,
they tighten up.

08:40.157 --> 08:42.361
- I've done gang work before.
- Well, this isn't the valley

08:42.450 --> 08:44.693
or the rio grande.
This is the majors.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.195
Listen, you're not ready for this.

08:47.425 --> 08:49.451
I know immigration isn't a cakewalk...

08:49.524 --> 08:52.229
I saw shit on that border you can't imagine.
4 years worth.

08:52.354 --> 08:53.409
I understand.

08:53.627 --> 08:56.784
But all those mexis, too smart
to get picked up, we got them.

08:57.147 --> 08:59.301
Plus black gangs, russian mob,

08:59.360 --> 09:02.270
salvadorans,
asians, armenians and more,

09:02.324 --> 09:04.509
all in the same square mile.

09:07.203 --> 09:08.852
What do you want me to say?

09:09.563 --> 09:10.642
You're right.

09:11.096 --> 09:13.417
So, you know, get me ready.

09:15.031 --> 09:18.364
All your dead buddies
were in the same one niner rack as you.

09:18.534 --> 09:22.182
Altered just like yours.
You starting up a new faction?

09:22.564 --> 09:25.785
Either you found a new set,
or you're trying to jump out.

09:25.885 --> 09:27.471
Both are punishable by death.

09:27.647 --> 09:29.852
My guess is you wanted to get out.

09:30.215 --> 09:31.908
In which case, you're not a bad guy.

09:32.301 --> 09:34.681
But I'm looking at you now, man,
with your locked jaw,

09:34.713 --> 09:36.546
your pissed off stare.

09:36.635 --> 09:39.664
- And I'm a black man, and you're a cop.
- So picture me with a puppy.

09:40.183 --> 09:41.750
Give you that warm, fuzzy feeling.

09:42.556 --> 09:43.627
Look, man.

09:44.215 --> 09:45.882
Banging ain't my life no more.

09:46.076 --> 09:47.520
I've been straight for 4 months.

09:47.610 --> 09:50.434
Then explain the .22 you were carrying
when we popped you.

09:50.739 --> 09:52.791
It's a little thing we call
self defense, man.

09:52.893 --> 09:56.163
If you're so squeaky, why were you and
your boys meeting up with the one niners?

09:58.655 --> 10:02.126
I need to know about Vontez, man.
If he got out.

10:03.416 --> 10:04.950
Les autres victimes portaient

10:05.108 --> 10:07.057
were wearing one niner colors.

10:08.546 --> 10:10.132
Now start talking.

10:19.042 --> 10:21.558
So Vontez is the leader of the revolution.

10:22.759 --> 10:25.635
And Vontez say, oppressors are oppressors.

10:25.882 --> 10:29.330
It don't matter if you black,
or you white. And you already know

10:29.375 --> 10:32.619
how much one niner soldiers make.
Hustling all day, all night.

10:32.709 --> 10:33.795
They all might as well be just

10:33.859 --> 10:36.021
flipping burgers.
That's oppression.

10:36.386 --> 10:40.021
Breaking ties with the one niners
over drug money ain't exactly noble.

10:40.252 --> 10:43.431
We quit selling.
That's why we quit paying.

10:43.626 --> 10:45.379
Banging doesn't come with an out clause.

10:45.438 --> 10:47.668
So what was your escape plan
for getting out alive?

10:47.928 --> 10:49.864
Just a bunch of boys from the block.

10:50.682 --> 10:51.954
We all jumped out together.

10:52.266 --> 10:53.394
Safety in numbers.

10:53.928 --> 10:54.948
How many?

10:55.779 --> 10:57.122
It was about 7.

10:58.503 --> 11:00.588
I mean the meeting was supposed
to be us settling up

11:00.589 --> 11:02.414
with them making sure
everything was solid.

11:02.469 --> 11:03.546
Why the guns?

11:04.024 --> 11:05.883
We ain't stupid, man.

11:07.421 --> 11:08.612
Anyway...

11:09.805 --> 11:11.631
Niners, they shot first.

11:12.794 --> 11:15.010
And the revolution begins.

11:16.222 --> 11:17.504
Stop it! Stop it!

11:18.069 --> 11:19.082
You with me?

11:19.126 --> 11:19.460
Yeah.

11:19.514 --> 11:21.850
1-Baker-23, code 6.

11:23.477 --> 11:24.638
Hands up!

11:24.870 --> 11:26.358
Get your hands up!

11:30.609 --> 11:32.779
What do you want? What do you want?

11:32.875 --> 11:35.144
I do nothing! I do nothing!

11:35.179 --> 11:36.769
Are you all right, hey.

11:37.824 --> 11:38.962
1-Baker-23.

11:39.034 --> 11:40.884
- I need a paramedic for an assault victim.
- Hey!

11:40.951 --> 11:42.245
I was watching that.

11:42.290 --> 11:45.367
- Hey, get a life, asshole.
- Got one, officer.

11:45.603 --> 11:48.374
Vontez Carter.
He's a low level one niner.

11:48.452 --> 11:51.721
I sent him to Corcoran about a year ago
for dealing and possession.

11:51.806 --> 11:54.368
This kid, he's more of a thinker
than a slider.

11:54.639 --> 11:57.113
He spent his 8 months reading Malcolm X,
Huey Newton.

11:57.321 --> 11:58.462
As soon as he was released,

11:58.512 --> 12:01.598
he started pulling his buddies out.
They stayed under the radar

12:01.645 --> 12:04.606
- till they stopped paying taxes.
- That meet this morning was a set up.

12:04.673 --> 12:06.622
Get the rebels in one place.
Take them all out at once.

12:06.669 --> 12:08.948
Look, these kids are trying to
get their lives straight.

12:09.082 --> 12:10.557
Make up for their mistakes.

12:11.313 --> 12:15.082
- How many of these revolutionaries are there?
- Minus the two that are dead

12:15.143 --> 12:17.669
and the one in interrogation,
four. All in the wind.

12:17.716 --> 12:19.719
With a hundred or so one niners
after their heads.

12:19.885 --> 12:20.909
Got a plan?

12:21.325 --> 12:24.082
Find Vontez and his boys,
get them off the streets for starters.

12:24.188 --> 12:26.418
Yeah? Thanks for weighing in.

12:27.321 --> 12:29.746
First thing we gotta do
is have a sit down with Moses.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.294
He's the head of the one niners.

12:31.473 --> 12:33.463
See if we can't convince him to back off.

12:33.818 --> 12:35.649
We can introduce him to the new guy

12:35.743 --> 12:36.634
while we're at it.

12:36.854 --> 12:39.316
Meantime, let's get the ball rolling
and find these kids.

12:39.471 --> 12:41.004
Keep me informed.

12:47.546 --> 12:50.310
Shane's still a bit raw about Lem.
It's nothing personal.

12:50.363 --> 12:52.232
- Hits everybody different.
- Yeah.

12:52.930 --> 12:55.671
- How are you doing?
- I've been better lately.

12:55.777 --> 12:59.448
50 bucks says Mackey and the new guy
get into it by the end of the day.

13:00.091 --> 13:01.372
No, thanks.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.067
Lowe and Sofer interrupted
a rape in progress.

13:04.144 --> 13:05.579
The victim's Graciela Sanchez.

13:05.656 --> 13:07.831
She's in the system.
She ran away from her fourth

13:07.914 --> 13:11.415
foster home 2 months ago.
She's at mission cross.

13:11.741 --> 13:14.818
I love the smell of underage
sexual assault in the morning.

13:17.355 --> 13:18.881
I didn't mean that the way it came out.

13:19.461 --> 13:21.730
Julien and Danny are riding together?

13:22.358 --> 13:25.255
For the moment. The suspect's been
apprehended at the scene.

13:25.319 --> 13:28.079
- What about Tina, she out sick?
- No. She transferred out.

13:29.293 --> 13:30.413
Finally make your move?

13:30.572 --> 13:33.193
Scare Hanlon and her
bikini briefs out the door.

13:43.054 --> 13:46.087
He say cops would be coming.
Come on.

13:47.162 --> 13:48.352
We're all out back.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.347
all the shit we cleaned up for Moses,

13:51.467 --> 13:53.557
we shouldn't be talking to this asshole
in front of Hyatt.

13:53.625 --> 13:57.304
You think he's gonna admit to killing kern?
For christ sakes, hold it together.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.392
And good. 'cause I got a shot
at keeping my job.

14:01.187 --> 14:03.558
There's an appeals hearing forming.
I'll fill you in later,

14:03.610 --> 14:05.343
but for now, help me be helpful.

14:07.871 --> 14:09.684
Mackey's lackeys.

14:11.461 --> 14:14.923
We're almost done, but I got a minute.
And who's this?

14:15.344 --> 14:18.209
Detective Hyatt.
But you can call me detective Hyatt.

14:18.279 --> 14:19.834
You're gonna be seeing a lot of him.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.677
Let me save you time asking.

14:21.729 --> 14:25.056
I gots none for you.
Low low shit ain't my concern.

14:25.355 --> 14:28.242
You boys set up a shooting gallery
at a chicken shack.

14:28.815 --> 14:32.417
If one of my lieutenants is having problems
with his quadrant, he solves it.

14:32.970 --> 14:34.086
I got zero knowledge.

14:34.275 --> 14:37.682
Might be good for you to let Vontez
and his boys go their own way.

14:37.858 --> 14:39.487
I mean, what's 7 soldiers

14:39.549 --> 14:40.909
in an army full of assholes?

14:41.070 --> 14:43.447
You fall for that Vontez
the revolutionary shit?

14:43.839 --> 14:46.138
Just a scam to take
more cut for himself.

14:46.543 --> 14:47.863
Hey, you got an eye cramp?

14:48.130 --> 14:50.600
Thought we told you to stay away
from the tweener pussy.

14:52.589 --> 14:54.354
You be having a good day now.

14:59.041 --> 15:01.864
Graciela's tox report
came back with extremely high levels of

15:01.921 --> 15:04.215
ghb. She was practically in a coma
when we got her.

15:04.252 --> 15:07.136
Date rape drugs.
21st century chivalry in action.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.630
Yeah, we've gotten lazy as a society.

15:09.858 --> 15:11.757
I'd write a song if you slip a girl a mickey.

15:11.872 --> 15:16.066
Anyway, her rape kit reads from a to z.
In addition to fresh vaginal tearing,

15:16.114 --> 15:18.879
she showed signs of significant anal trauma.

15:19.471 --> 15:20.964
There's something else.

15:28.414 --> 15:29.491
Jesus.

15:30.956 --> 15:32.309
Before he raped her?

15:32.694 --> 15:36.208
Appears to be one or two days old.
What do you think it means?

15:39.265 --> 15:41.931
There's no point in lying, mehud.
Two police officers

15:41.992 --> 15:43.403
caught you raping her.

15:43.848 --> 15:46.884
- I screw her, but I no rape her.
- What does "go home" mean?

15:47.177 --> 15:48.139
So what happened?

15:48.247 --> 15:51.208
You get a hard on,
you slip her a roofie at some club,

15:51.407 --> 15:53.497
huh?
You give drugs, she go sleep?

15:53.629 --> 15:55.513
I find her. She look like hooker.

15:55.631 --> 15:58.862
I say, give 20 bucks for quick bang.
She nodded ok.

15:58.926 --> 16:01.419
Either way, at some point,
she became unconscious.

16:01.496 --> 16:03.799
- What? I'm supposed to stop?
- Yeah!

16:04.946 --> 16:07.639
Why do you want her to go home?

16:08.303 --> 16:10.931
I give her 20 bucks in her pocket.
Look and see.

16:14.899 --> 16:16.770
- He didn't do it.
- What?

16:20.688 --> 16:22.111
- He didn't cut her up.
- Great.

16:26.657 --> 16:28.179
Vontez framed this himself.

16:28.403 --> 16:31.473
Said it reminds him of where he's been
and don't want to go again.

16:31.537 --> 16:33.578
Let us get your son somewhere safe.

16:33.671 --> 16:34.830
He's better off on his own.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.413
- Hey, hey. Vic.
- Shit.

16:36.456 --> 16:37.883
Get inside. Keep your head down.

16:39.042 --> 16:41.474
What's up?
What's up, man?

16:47.373 --> 16:49.394
Get out of here, assholes.

16:51.765 --> 16:55.368
Niners been driving by here
every 5 minutes all day acting tough.

16:55.552 --> 16:57.908
My boy's gotta hide from them and you
just the same.

16:57.998 --> 17:00.727
Tell us where your son is.
Vontez can't do this on his own.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.108
Oh, he won't have to.
See a lot of people think my boy

17:03.400 --> 17:04.363
is a hero.

17:04.521 --> 17:06.202
Look, please...

17:07.011 --> 17:11.546
If you want your son to be a live hero,
not a dead martyr, have him call me.

17:11.623 --> 17:12.451
I just want to talk.

17:24.355 --> 17:26.730
If I'd have known
I was gonna see you today,

17:26.833 --> 17:28.319
I would've worn that little top you like.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.885
Thought you were gonna stop
seeing that asshole.

17:31.090 --> 17:33.801
I know.
It's just hard to find the moment.

17:33.878 --> 17:34.610
Well, then try harder.

17:35.543 --> 17:37.160
I don't want him touching you.

17:37.601 --> 17:39.139
Ok, baby.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.513
What do you want?
You.

17:43.702 --> 17:47.733
But I need Moses' lieutenant
who's cracking down on Vontez.

17:50.732 --> 17:52.945
Lieutenant's Angelo Owens.

17:54.039 --> 17:56.573
But he's just doing this
'cause Moses came down on him.

17:56.764 --> 17:57.693
I mean, them boys,

17:57.762 --> 17:59.456
they been friends
they whole lives.

17:59.791 --> 18:01.201
Where's Angelo?

18:02.970 --> 18:06.406
Blue house on Warnol.
By the gas station.

18:06.551 --> 18:08.673
Look, don't get me
in trouble with the niners.

18:09.100 --> 18:12.654
Ain't nobody messing with you, tilly.
They're the ones in trouble, ok?

18:20.102 --> 18:23.993
End it with Moses. Today.
I need you to do that.

18:24.363 --> 18:25.440
For me.

18:26.227 --> 18:26.714
Ok?

18:27.599 --> 18:30.086
One niners are all clamped down.
I want to settle this in-house.

18:30.284 --> 18:32.720
What about the families?
Somebody knows where these kids are.

18:32.771 --> 18:35.814
The niners have got them too scared to talk,
or they don't know where they are.

18:35.925 --> 18:38.823
I want to send a message.
Somebody wants out of a gang,

18:38.973 --> 18:42.012
we're here to protect them.
Find Vontez and his friends.

18:42.194 --> 18:45.000
Anything you need to bring them in safe,
you got it.

18:47.247 --> 18:48.454
Hey, man, where's Shane?

18:48.557 --> 18:51.185
Said he had some C.I.
Somebody from when he was in vice.

18:51.262 --> 18:52.621
Shane was in Vice?

18:52.906 --> 18:55.573
That explains a lot.
Vice guys are pretty intense.

18:55.657 --> 18:59.009
Just picture Shane with a puppy.
It'll give you that warm, fuzzy feeling.

18:59.925 --> 19:02.450
That's Hyatt's interrogation technique.
No shit.

19:03.553 --> 19:05.508
What, are you trying to get answers
or pussy?

19:06.843 --> 19:08.176
Whatever it takes, right?

19:09.327 --> 19:10.980
Glad to see everybody's having fun.

19:11.905 --> 19:13.315
Of course, Lem's still dead.

19:14.741 --> 19:16.485
Anyone else give a shit about that?

19:18.325 --> 19:21.556
- Hey, we...
- Shut up, man. You don't belong here.

19:21.644 --> 19:22.769
In this room.

19:23.039 --> 19:24.114
2 minutes of breathing your air,

19:24.179 --> 19:26.244
I could tell you're not
half the man or cop Lem was.

19:26.292 --> 19:28.648
I got thick skin, man,
but you're starting to chafe.

19:28.905 --> 19:31.034
You guys just act like
everything's fine, man.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.249
Like shit just moves on, right?

19:33.727 --> 19:34.754
It does.

19:34.862 --> 19:35.439
Yeah?

19:37.341 --> 19:38.485
Not for me.

19:40.706 --> 19:42.746
I actually give a shit that he's gone.

19:55.221 --> 19:58.260
Uh, lieutenant's Angelo Owens.
He's got a location over on Warnol.

19:59.338 --> 20:00.906
Good. Thanks.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.897
My C.I. says Angelo set up the shootings,

20:04.961 --> 20:07.580
but Moses didn't give him much choice.

20:13.851 --> 20:15.854
I just, I didn't want him back.

20:17.298 --> 20:20.080
And what's with that guy, man.
I mean, he's not Lem, you know.

20:20.716 --> 20:22.218
This is what's real, all right.

20:22.758 --> 20:26.472
You keep this up, I'm not the only one
around here that's not gonna have a job.

20:26.946 --> 20:29.638
You.
Maybe Ronnie, too.

20:30.013 --> 20:31.657
You know Lem wouldn't want that.

20:32.321 --> 20:34.848
In a couple of weeks,
this appeals panel

20:34.900 --> 20:37.024
is deciding
whether to send me packing or not.

20:37.473 --> 20:39.607
I'm gonna need this Hyatt on my side.

20:39.766 --> 20:41.612
If he says he needs me, I got a shot.

20:41.899 --> 20:43.090
Yeah, I hear that.

20:44.394 --> 20:48.082
What happened with Lem...
Slate's clean.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.768
We made that right.
Right?

20:51.283 --> 20:52.126
You think killing Guardo

20:52.190 --> 20:54.433
- made any difference, man, Lem's dead.
- Oh, jesus.

20:54.625 --> 20:55.751
Corinne said he's pissed.

20:55.829 --> 20:58.086
- She said she's never seen him like that.
- Stop.

20:59.198 --> 21:01.465
I can't deal with a goddamn dream right now.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.753
Look, just find this lieutenant.

21:06.703 --> 21:08.835
Let's save who we can save today.

21:14.905 --> 21:15.938
Mackey.

21:16.015 --> 21:18.232
Hey. You wanted me to call.

21:19.097 --> 21:21.246
- Vontez, where are you?
- Don't matter.

21:21.458 --> 21:22.866
I gotta handle this.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.189
Look, man, let me put you
into protective custody.

21:25.287 --> 21:28.672
Moses even knows I talked to the cops.
Niners ain't going back to the table.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.658
Moses wants you dead. Where are you?

21:30.836 --> 21:32.321
Do you read Dubois?

21:33.662 --> 21:35.636
Do I... No.

21:36.332 --> 21:37.710
He wrote about the path

21:37.790 --> 21:40.296
of honor and humanity.
I die,

21:40.708 --> 21:43.900
I still got that.
More than most people got.

21:44.398 --> 21:46.454
- Just wanted to tell you stop looking.
- Vontez.

21:46.617 --> 21:48.732
- Don't feel like being found.
- Come on, man. Vontez.

21:49.019 --> 21:50.106
Shit!

21:53.867 --> 21:56.576
So the site's coming along.
You're making quick time.

21:56.803 --> 21:59.179
Thanks to the support from the
housing commission.

21:59.798 --> 22:01.358
A few more, gracias,

22:01.838 --> 22:03.903
construction hurdles.

22:04.362 --> 22:07.663
It's an easy sell.
It's a worthwhile project.

22:08.996 --> 22:11.160
Noticed something else
you've been selling.

22:12.320 --> 22:15.653
A cleaner, kinder Farmington P.D.

22:16.431 --> 22:18.042
There was a bad apple.

22:18.473 --> 22:20.544
He got deep, he got himself killed,

22:20.734 --> 22:23.059
police committee wants
the community to know

22:23.114 --> 22:24.875
that the rest of the players
are still here to protect them.

22:25.650 --> 22:28.432
It's tough to buy
when you've got 12 dead mexicans

22:28.509 --> 22:31.402
slaughtered in that house in san marcos.
And no arrests.

22:31.512 --> 22:34.620
Those murders were handed off to
robbery/homicide. Farmington's out of it.

22:34.771 --> 22:37.296
RHD doesn't give a shit about
a dozen illegals.

22:37.368 --> 22:39.441
They did, this thing
would be solved already.

22:41.285 --> 22:43.503
I'll make some calls.
See if I can light a fire.

22:44.841 --> 22:47.113
Couple of the guys
from the crew came to me.

22:47.405 --> 22:51.110
Said they've heard rumors that
a salvadoran gang called

22:51.177 --> 22:53.904
"Larasa Juanaca" was responsible.

22:54.112 --> 22:55.287
I'll pass it along.

22:55.686 --> 22:58.698
If the Farmington p.d.
Were to crack this case,

22:59.217 --> 23:01.999
it would go along toward
allaying your constituents

23:02.086 --> 23:04.429
belief that police don't care.

23:06.357 --> 23:08.267
It would reflect well on you.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.563
You should've been a politician, Cruz.

23:15.338 --> 23:16.934
I leave that to the experts.

23:19.913 --> 23:23.432
You remember that runaway came in
6 months ago? Claimed she'd been kidnapped?

23:23.729 --> 23:26.228
- Rings a bell.
- I dug up her taped statement.

23:27.730 --> 23:29.438
- Oops.
- Sorry.

23:31.102 --> 23:32.281
It's ok, I...

23:32.867 --> 23:34.559
I thought I'd have some privacy in here.

23:34.754 --> 23:36.895
you can use my office anytime.

23:37.087 --> 23:39.139
Sure.

23:46.173 --> 23:47.904
Princess Gaines. Ran away.

23:47.953 --> 23:50.594
Came back a month later
mom found blood on her pants,

23:50.700 --> 23:53.713
asked about it, princess said
she was abducted, anally assaulted,

23:54.048 --> 23:55.971
and held captive for two weeks.

23:58.009 --> 23:59.073
he was white.

23:59.408 --> 24:00.591
Or latin.

24:01.115 --> 24:02.398
Yeah, he was a latin dude.

24:02.471 --> 24:04.565
Can you tell us anything else?

24:05.004 --> 24:07.506
Not too much.
Had me drugged or something.

24:07.784 --> 24:08.819
Or something?

24:09.594 --> 24:12.354
So the last thing she remembered
was begging outside of a burger place.

24:12.402 --> 24:16.479
Next thing she knew, she woke up in a
strange room, man was holding her prisoner.

24:17.674 --> 24:19.223
It would really help us.

24:19.282 --> 24:20.903
Any little detail.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.168
He kept saying, "go home now. Go home."

24:25.299 --> 24:28.842
And then this man just... let you go?

24:28.898 --> 24:30.165
I'm here ain't i?

24:30.364 --> 24:32.508
One morning, i just wake up in the street.

24:32.590 --> 24:34.874
- What'd you do then?
- Did what he said.

24:34.929 --> 24:36.013
Went home.

24:39.494 --> 24:41.434
- We didn't believe her.
- Yeah.

24:42.386 --> 24:45.641
She didn't take a rape kit.
Toxic screen came back negative.

24:45.961 --> 24:47.463
Case didn't add up.

24:48.417 --> 24:51.052
So this guy targets runaways.
Uses GHB

24:51.153 --> 24:53.719
to keep them out of it just long
enough to do what he pleases.

24:54.176 --> 24:57.571
While telling them to go home.
Like good little girls.

24:57.653 --> 24:59.537
So graciela got double pumped.

24:59.984 --> 25:02.667
This creep does her in the rear,
and left the vaginal cavity

25:02.748 --> 25:04.878
intact for mehud to spill
his load in the alley.

25:04.992 --> 25:07.292
The cutting's an escalation.

25:08.521 --> 25:11.103
- He'll go further next time.
- I'll call the mom.

25:11.516 --> 25:13.175
Bring princess in.

25:21.227 --> 25:23.339
So your lieutenant set up a slaughter house

25:23.436 --> 25:25.765
this morning without any
encouragement from you.

25:25.832 --> 25:29.322
The streets|are full of liars.
Ain't my fault somebody
says i got fingers in this.

25:29.399 --> 25:30.612
You're a two striker.

25:30.693 --> 25:32.432
All i need is one good bust.

25:34.013 --> 25:37.580
You gonna plant some shit on me?
You wouldn't do that, right, Mackey?

25:37.791 --> 25:39.340
Leave me out of options.

25:41.445 --> 25:43.980
We stay on you, we'll get you
fair and square.

25:44.557 --> 25:46.178
Might take a couple of months.

25:46.292 --> 25:47.817
But you can bank on it.

25:51.118 --> 25:51.994
Shoot.

25:55.722 --> 25:58.637
Hey, fellas.
What say we trade some names.

25:59.881 --> 26:01.257
You two, come here.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.041
Vontez is the one caused me problems.

26:05.242 --> 26:06.460
He dies.

26:06.941 --> 26:10.433
The other ones... I'll pull the order
as soon as vontez is cold.

26:10.667 --> 26:11.922
That's what i'm offering.

26:12.078 --> 26:14.156
Now what do i get for my generosity?

26:14.396 --> 26:15.650
What do you want?

26:18.414 --> 26:21.538
Back off my boys.
I don't want to see no popo for 6 months.

26:21.635 --> 26:23.996
2 months. Me and my guys stay away.

26:24.483 --> 26:26.552
I don't control the black and whites.

26:27.704 --> 26:29.085
You control them on me?

26:30.987 --> 26:33.975
But you pull the order on the other three
right now.

26:51.565 --> 26:54.360
- Lover's quarrel?
- Moses had a proposal.

26:54.730 --> 26:57.331
Sacrifice vontez, the other three stay safe.

26:57.470 --> 27:00.831
So what's stopping us hauling his ass in
on conspiracy charges right now?

27:01.051 --> 27:02.619
I took the deal.

27:04.656 --> 27:06.596
At least, that's what he thinks.

27:07.563 --> 27:08.784
I teach you all my tricks

27:08.877 --> 27:10.958
on the first day,
what are we gonna do tomorrow?

27:17.925 --> 27:20.432
You're looking for princess gaines.
16.

27:20.561 --> 27:23.415
According to her mother,
she ran away for a second time

27:23.504 --> 27:25.057
couple of months ago.

27:25.349 --> 27:27.109
Start with runaway row.

27:27.268 --> 27:30.086
Shelters, fast food places, huh?
Thank you.

27:32.550 --> 27:36.241
Um, i'm sorry about, um...
Busting in on you.

27:37.224 --> 27:39.028
I know it's all perfectly natural.

27:39.145 --> 27:41.605
Don't worry, i'll keep them
locked down from now on.

27:41.704 --> 27:43.993
Wow. They put hanlon on a poster.

27:46.285 --> 27:47.544
Oh, great.

27:48.745 --> 27:53.212
She gets to be miss farmington, huh?
And i'm stuck with her p1 duties.

27:53.376 --> 27:54.640
Let's ride.

27:55.653 --> 27:58.380
Take one home tonight. Do it in private.
Right now we got the

27:58.549 --> 28:01.420
files of every latin sex offender
in a 10-mile radius to go through.

28:01.509 --> 28:02.894
Where'd this come from?

28:02.993 --> 28:04.386
Captain told me to put them up.

28:04.555 --> 28:06.437
Well, yeah, but where did it come from?

28:06.578 --> 28:08.434
Do i look omniscient?

28:16.067 --> 28:17.665
Hey, what's the deal with the poster?

28:17.841 --> 28:20.371
The all new faceless cop fighting bogus O.T.

28:20.688 --> 28:22.400
She's out, tina's in.

28:22.523 --> 28:25.831
Posters, public appearances,
the whole bit. She's citywide.

28:25.961 --> 28:27.963
But tina wanted to be a detective.

28:31.037 --> 28:33.315
This is straight from the chief's office. She was picked
from the P.R. Photos  they shot the other day.

28:33.399 --> 28:35.309
Ok, thanks. We'll be right down there.

28:35.605 --> 28:38.761
Dutchman, graciela's awake. We got a sketch.

28:41.467 --> 28:42.888
One baker, 23 roger.

28:42.976 --> 28:44.887
Do you have a description of the vehicle?

28:45.179 --> 28:47.053
- Do you copy?
- Shit.

28:53.437 --> 28:55.981
Can't afford a babysitter that speaks english.

28:56.697 --> 28:58.391
- Shit.
- One baker 23.

28:58.508 --> 29:01.418
- We're approaching at 12th and effie.
- Roger that.

29:20.137 --> 29:23.022
Vontez was your friend. Your soldier.

29:23.592 --> 29:27.609
Him, marlon, jayson, they're all still
out there trying to escape your hit.

29:27.943 --> 29:30.934
Fine way to treat your friends, lieutenant.
What do you do on birthdays?

29:31.217 --> 29:32.623
I don't want to.

29:33.431 --> 29:35.056
Make the call, angelo.

29:35.783 --> 29:37.106
Put an end to this right now.

29:37.566 --> 29:39.872
I didn't push the button.
I can't unpush it.

29:39.955 --> 29:42.294
Moses is laying all of this on you, man.

29:42.411 --> 29:46.714
So why don't you tell me something different.
Give me moses. We can work out a deal.

29:47.323 --> 29:48.763
Cop says deal, you go to jail.

29:48.937 --> 29:52.144
Call off the hit.
You can still make this right.

29:52.468 --> 29:55.210
I do what you want,
i'm a dead man, and my family, too.

29:55.654 --> 29:57.501
Life is just the way life is.

30:03.311 --> 30:06.008
- Who is it? Is it vontez?
- Daniel billup.

30:06.093 --> 30:07.899
- You're sure?
- Positive.

30:12.963 --> 30:13.964
Goddamn.

30:14.718 --> 30:17.582
I guess moses wasn't planning
on keeping his end of the deal either, huh?

30:18.147 --> 30:19.368
I guess not.

30:19.962 --> 30:21.658
One down, three to go.

30:28.276 --> 30:30.315
Hey, step back. Sir, step back.

30:30.438 --> 30:33.894
- Move it. Come on.
- I don't want to see this shit like this, man, damn.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.005
Daniel was on a peace mission.

30:36.146 --> 30:38.368
- Vontez sent him back to the table.
- Yeah.

30:38.542 --> 30:40.922
Someone sure shoved the peace pipe
right back up his ass.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.541
- I don't want to go over there.
- No, man, that's my nigger!

30:43.662 --> 30:44.420
Damn!

30:45.124 --> 30:46.316
Damn, man!

30:46.584 --> 30:48.928
Give him to me. Hey, ray.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.389
You see this?

30:52.160 --> 30:55.461
That's what's gonna happen to the rest of your friends
if you don't help me find out where they're holed up.

30:55.546 --> 30:56.982
One niners took his cell phone.

30:57.107 --> 30:59.508
Any call daniel made, they're gonna know
about it.

30:59.697 --> 31:01.410
Only a matter of time
before some one niner

31:01.504 --> 31:02.858
finds that person.

31:03.266 --> 31:05.153
My man vontez can defend himself, man.

31:05.242 --> 31:07.495
He might be a revolutionary,
but he ain't bulletproof.

31:07.651 --> 31:10.999
We find him, or the one niners leave
the rest of their bodies for us to find, ray.

31:11.075 --> 31:12.874
How many funerals you want to go to?

31:16.003 --> 31:16.973
Bag him.

31:17.082 --> 31:19.352
Look at me. Ray.

31:19.455 --> 31:21.348
You've done a lot of bad things, ray.

31:22.082 --> 31:25.252
Sold drugs, stole money. Murdered.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.528
You do this one last
good thing for your friends.

31:32.475 --> 31:35.014
Vontez would've called
his cousin akil, man.

31:35.170 --> 31:36.473
He'll know where they at.

31:36.541 --> 31:38.528
All right. Take him.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.351
Let's find this akil.

31:49.414 --> 31:51.027
Police! Open up!

31:54.735 --> 31:56.149
Oh, the hell with it.

31:56.412 --> 31:58.010
Hands on your head! Don't move!

31:58.489 --> 31:59.678
Hands on your head!

32:01.667 --> 32:03.484
Sending your cousin on a little trip?

32:04.152 --> 32:05.278
Where's vontez?

32:10.876 --> 32:12.128
The mask was red.

32:12.694 --> 32:16.387
Anything else you remember?
Maybe he took you somewhere?

32:16.953 --> 32:18.882
You remember something about his hands?

32:19.282 --> 32:20.816
He have an accent?

32:22.535 --> 32:23.896
Detective wagenbach.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.134
Nurses say she needs a gentle touch.

32:31.715 --> 32:33.717
You're the gentle touch, i suppose?

32:33.889 --> 32:37.076
- I happen to be a wonderful father.
- Two weekends a month.

32:42.577 --> 32:43.928
I'll be outside.

32:48.582 --> 32:52.879
Sometimes i think humans need
a subspecies to categorize these bastards.

32:54.293 --> 32:57.348
Hey, i saw vic this morning.
He's doing better.

32:58.274 --> 33:01.737
I, uh, i hear he's handling the situation
with his replacement well.

33:02.513 --> 33:05.132
- What, they filled lem's spot?
- Vic's replacement.

33:05.430 --> 33:08.901
Some guy named hiatt. He's taking
over the strike team when vic retires.

33:09.350 --> 33:10.986
That's not for years.

33:17.040 --> 33:20.122
Department's pushing him out at his 15 mark.

33:20.830 --> 33:22.415
It's in, like, a month.

33:26.426 --> 33:28.254
So, how's hiatt working out?

33:28.674 --> 33:31.459
He's nothing like vic. I love him.

33:32.307 --> 33:35.781
The dead mexicans dutch found.
They were killed with a machete?

33:35.884 --> 33:36.854
Several machetes.

33:36.956 --> 33:38.779
Based on the number of body parts.

33:38.968 --> 33:43.102
I got word today from a community back channel
that a salvadoran gang did the job.

33:43.694 --> 33:45.241
You heard of larasa juanaca?

33:45.467 --> 33:47.313
I didn't realize they'd come this far north.

33:47.398 --> 33:50.783
It could be the murders,
or the juanaca's response to the influx

33:50.859 --> 33:53.095
from the prison closures in mexico.

33:53.323 --> 33:57.493
Salvadorans putting out the unwelcome mat
for the mexican competitors.

33:57.678 --> 34:01.194
It occurred to me that hiatt's background
in ins makes him the perfect candidate

34:01.287 --> 34:03.132
- to get to the bottom of it.
- Maybe.

34:03.472 --> 34:05.959
If he was at robbery homicide.
It's there's.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.295
I had the case transferred back to the barn.

34:11.239 --> 34:13.716
You said you weren't gonna pull any strings.

34:14.127 --> 34:16.995
Come on, handled correctly,
this could be the big p.r. Win we need.

34:17.085 --> 34:20.219
Or a crime stat's nightmare
that shuts this door forever.

34:20.411 --> 34:22.458
You solve this, that's a dozen murders

34:22.558 --> 34:23.869
in the win column.

34:24.063 --> 34:27.132
It just might be enough
to put your quarterly stats over the top.

34:27.344 --> 34:28.731
Keep these doors open.

34:30.858 --> 34:34.088
Man, this wire shit, this is straight up
dirty snitch, man.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.311
Blame akil.

34:35.456 --> 34:38.530
He'd given us the info we need,
we'd be off saving your friends by now.

34:38.824 --> 34:39.733
He's set.

34:39.846 --> 34:43.514
Once akil gives you the location where
vontez is hiding, give the signal.

34:43.621 --> 34:46.985
Don't make it obvious though.
He gets suspicious, we're shit out of luck.

34:47.217 --> 34:49.530
- Got a sec?
- Sure.

34:54.487 --> 34:58.196
A possible man for your team.
Take a look at his jacket, see what you think.

34:58.291 --> 34:59.326
Will do.

35:00.984 --> 35:03.965
You know, mackey played moses today.

35:04.755 --> 35:06.258
He let him think he was making a deal.

35:06.358 --> 35:09.559
Vontez dies, the others go free.
It's a smart strategy.

35:10.147 --> 35:12.429
It didn't work,
but it got me thinking.

35:13.035 --> 35:14.701
So far, it seems
that

35:14.910 --> 35:17.304
mackey's usually spinning
three different wheels at once.

35:17.412 --> 35:21.294
Creating the perception that he's willing
to cut a deal. Go off the grid. It's a way in.

35:22.645 --> 35:24.762
Maybe this reputation

35:24.934 --> 35:27.475
has more to do with that perception
than with reality.

35:29.069 --> 35:31.415
Vic is showing you his good side

35:31.655 --> 35:34.183
because it's in his best interest.

35:34.767 --> 35:36.257
Ne soyez pas dupe.

35:34.816 --> 35:36.257
Don't be fooled.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.779
Man, can you get up off me?

35:42.450 --> 35:44.460
Let's see how you sit.

35:49.216 --> 35:51.028
Hey, man. I can walk by myself, man.

35:51.188 --> 35:52.717
Et tu sais t'asseoir ?

35:58.682 --> 36:01.561
Anyway, the poster looks great.

36:02.263 --> 36:04.825
Give me a call, if you want.

36:07.780 --> 36:10.374
Hey. Worked up a profile on our guy.

36:10.666 --> 36:14.544
Single dad, probably had a daughter
disappeared or died prematurely.

36:14.587 --> 36:17.381
Thinks he's teaching his
victims a lesson. Go home.

36:17.806 --> 36:19.968
Good advice. If it
didn't involve kidnapping,

36:20.051 --> 36:21.302
rape, and torture.

36:21.458 --> 36:24.272
Profiling's overrated. Shoe
leather is what cracks cases.

36:24.385 --> 36:26.528
Come on. You just like making
stories up in your head.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.314
Kind of like the one about you and tina.

36:28.497 --> 36:32.355
Fact is, you don't have a shot. Looks
department alone you're a total mismatch.

36:32.643 --> 36:34.566
What, you're such an adonis?

36:34.730 --> 36:36.682
I know the kind of lady
who's attracted to me,

36:36.770 --> 36:38.189
and it ain't tina.

36:38.638 --> 36:41.089
Helping her improve her
skills had nothing to do

36:41.155 --> 36:42.998
- with any interest in her.
- Right.

36:43.139 --> 36:46.351
She happens to have talent.
Even if others don't see it yet.

36:47.059 --> 36:48.127
Face it. You took advantage

36:48.162 --> 36:50.539
of her vulnerability. Just
like our mystery psycho.

36:50.865 --> 36:52.286
Except your drug of choice was power

36:52.333 --> 36:54.425
and the false hope
of career advancement.

36:55.378 --> 36:57.088
That's ridiculous.

36:57.380 --> 36:58.650
You have a reputation, holland.

36:58.714 --> 37:01.079
Chasing mulies, mackey's ex.

37:01.266 --> 37:04.455
Wives of murder victims. I
think a profiler would call that

37:04.670 --> 37:06.515
a pattern of shitting where you eat.

37:06.585 --> 37:11.268
I happen to be devoted to my job. I don't
exactly have time to hit the bar scene.

37:11.733 --> 37:13.813
I want to ask tina out, i will.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.122
You let me know how that goes.

37:16.195 --> 37:18.770
Ramos found princess
gaines. He's bringing her in.

37:19.126 --> 37:19.967
Thanks, paula.

37:19.989 --> 37:21.567
Mom's on her way, too.

37:23.071 --> 37:24.490
Here he's at it again.

37:24.913 --> 37:27.689
Congratulations on getting
another girl ass raped.

37:29.123 --> 37:30.999
I'm sorry we didn't believe you.

37:31.643 --> 37:35.292
At the time you came in, we just
couldn't corroborate your story.

37:35.443 --> 37:38.754
- But that may have changed.
- Ain't no never mind to me.

37:39.338 --> 37:41.387
I cried my tears all out.

37:41.955 --> 37:43.928
I whipped this girl
based on you telling me

37:44.009 --> 37:44.919
she lied.

37:44.990 --> 37:47.420
- And now you're telling me she didn't?
- There's another girl.

37:47.707 --> 37:49.820
Certain details in her story

37:49.939 --> 37:52.306
match what princess
said happened to her.

37:52.557 --> 37:55.260
I told her to go to the
police. Tell them what happened.

37:55.342 --> 37:56.505
I said, the police would help.

37:56.599 --> 38:00.449
We are so sorry, mrs. Gaines. We just
didn't have enough evidence at the time.

38:00.504 --> 38:03.026
Well, that beating i gave
her is on your two heads.

38:03.388 --> 38:05.153
Just ask her what she knows.

38:05.501 --> 38:07.082
I want my daughter home.

38:08.194 --> 38:09.456
Do you rember

38:09.574 --> 38:12.413
any details since we talked to you last?

38:13.577 --> 38:14.840
Wish i didn't.

38:15.373 --> 38:17.649
Anything you can tell us?
What he looked like,

38:17.718 --> 38:19.211
where he held you?

38:20.639 --> 38:23.239
It was a girl's room
only from a long time ago.

38:23.404 --> 38:24.539
How so?

38:24.706 --> 38:26.943
Posters on the wall were all whack.

38:27.025 --> 38:29.263
White boys in these gay poses.

38:29.746 --> 38:33.271
One of them was called,
like, 65 degrees or something.

38:33.419 --> 38:34.602
98 degrees.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.247
Took my oldest to the concert.

38:39.221 --> 38:41.957
Do you recognize this man?

38:42.607 --> 38:44.611
I know it's not much of a sketch.

38:46.756 --> 38:48.166
Those are his eyes.

38:57.140 --> 38:59.404
Ray's got akil chatting.
Shouldn't be long before

38:59.462 --> 39:00.860
we learn vontez' whereabouts.

39:01.658 --> 39:02.950
Little light reading?

39:03.713 --> 39:05.216
Package just came in.

39:06.436 --> 39:09.765
"not looking forward to the 8x10
cell, "fighting for the top bunk...

39:11.512 --> 39:14.530
"but i figure the least i can do
"is come out smarter than i went in.

39:14.667 --> 39:16.650
"send these to me wherever i land.

39:18.196 --> 39:19.897
I'll miss you. Lem."

39:21.567 --> 39:25.419
he ordered these online the night
before he went on the run.

39:25.560 --> 39:28.812
Art, sports, history,
stephen king. Look at this.

39:29.694 --> 39:31.298
"birds of america."

39:34.012 --> 39:35.705
"dreams and what they mean."

39:48.857 --> 39:50.808
so what do you want
to do with these books?

39:56.923 --> 39:58.754
Vontez is a big reader, right?

40:01.526 --> 40:02.857
Well, we're gonna find him.

40:03.561 --> 40:05.036
And the other two.

40:06.181 --> 40:09.572
We're gonna send them
someplace peaceful. Safe.

40:14.489 --> 40:16.412
We're gonna give the books to him.

40:23.670 --> 40:24.633
Corinne.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.814
Yeah, where are you?

40:28.049 --> 40:29.592
What are you doing out there?

40:30.521 --> 40:32.042
All right. I'm on the way out.

40:33.868 --> 40:35.119
Give me a minute.

40:41.082 --> 40:44.061
- You could've come inside.
- I've only got a half hour break

40:44.155 --> 40:46.582
and i don't want everyone in
there to know our business.

40:47.062 --> 40:49.278
Except i guess they already
hear everything first anyway.

40:50.637 --> 40:53.087
The so-called retirement. Oh, shit.

40:53.181 --> 40:54.219
- Look, i was gonna...
- What,

40:54.278 --> 40:56.837
were you gonna send me
a postcard from florida?

40:57.680 --> 41:00.375
I just spoke to the captain. It's
probably not even gonna happen.

41:00.532 --> 41:01.722
What if it does?

41:01.974 --> 41:04.598
I mean, are you figuring
things out, making plans?

41:04.795 --> 41:07.492
Or do you think your check is just
gonna magically appear in my mail?

41:07.644 --> 41:09.615
I'll work it out. I've
always taken care of the kids.

41:10.393 --> 41:11.647
Yeah, i know.

41:12.494 --> 41:14.157
And i see what it costs you.

41:14.775 --> 41:16.686
I don't want that anymore, vic.

41:16.857 --> 41:20.234
I don't want me or them responsible
for all the things you do.

41:21.196 --> 41:24.426
- It's all in the past.
- I hope so.

41:24.845 --> 41:26.042
We've lost enough.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.590
Hey, wire worked. We got a location.

41:28.876 --> 41:30.611
Vontez is holed up with the other two.

41:30.903 --> 41:33.239
I'm not gonna lose my job. I promise.

41:40.621 --> 41:43.774
God, the amount of time i
spend attached to that machine.

41:44.705 --> 41:47.089
I hope this is enough to
get me through tomorrow.

41:51.640 --> 41:52.675
What?

41:53.159 --> 41:54.309
Nothing.

41:56.449 --> 41:58.460
You think i should've
taken my full 6 weeks, huh?

41:58.530 --> 42:01.020
- Be there to feed lee myself.
- I wasn't thinking that.

42:01.102 --> 42:03.821
Come on, julien, you had 9 months
to lay your judgments on me.

42:03.903 --> 42:06.022
I'm not saying anything.

42:07.409 --> 42:10.192
I'm sorry. I'm just so tired.

42:10.579 --> 42:13.127
It beats riding with tina.

42:13.521 --> 42:15.698
I'm gonna get my groove back, i promise.

42:16.304 --> 42:17.463
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:19.806 --> 42:21.885
- Good night, captain.
- Good night.

42:22.538 --> 42:23.997
Everything all right?

42:24.597 --> 42:26.097
Sleep deprivation.

42:27.236 --> 42:30.331
Hiatt's decided to add another
member to the strike team.

42:30.449 --> 42:33.132
I suggested you. Say yes.

42:34.254 --> 42:36.800
- Working with vic?
- Hiatt will be taking over.

42:36.967 --> 42:40.377
It's an opportunity. More money,
more prestige. Making a difference.

42:40.483 --> 42:42.156
Those guys will never accept me.

42:42.250 --> 42:45.306
They won't have a choice. It may
still be called the strike team,

42:45.391 --> 42:48.514
but it's a different animal.
No more bullshit antics.

42:48.615 --> 42:52.388
You can handle this, julien. Say yes.

42:57.527 --> 42:58.608
All right.

42:59.901 --> 43:01.122
Thank you, captain.

43:01.404 --> 43:03.811
New life starts tomorrow. Good luck.

43:14.090 --> 43:15.450
Vontez!

43:16.113 --> 43:18.200
It's vic mackey. I just want to talk.

43:22.581 --> 43:23.884
He's back here!

43:24.799 --> 43:27.445
He's hurt. He was shot this morning.

43:27.574 --> 43:28.729
Clear!

43:30.544 --> 43:31.777
Holy shit.

43:32.061 --> 43:33.793
Vontez. What happened?

43:33.984 --> 43:36.600
He was shot this morning at the
restaurant. You gotta help him.

43:37.637 --> 43:39.191
And you just let him bleed?

43:39.283 --> 43:41.766
He wouldn't let us get help.
He said moses would find us.

43:42.410 --> 43:44.667
He wouldn't even let me tell his cousin.

43:45.409 --> 43:46.601
Niners will come.

43:46.747 --> 43:48.570
Shit, he's going into shock.

43:49.265 --> 43:51.237
Vontez, open your eyes. Wake up, man.

43:51.363 --> 43:53.219
He bleeds out, moses
lets the other two live.

43:53.378 --> 43:54.630
All three of them live.

43:55.121 --> 43:57.200
- Keep your eyes open. Stay with me.
- Need an ambulance

43:57.299 --> 43:59.160
9246 Norton.

43:59.711 --> 44:02.106
Come on, open your
eyes. Stay awake, man.

44:04.125 --> 44:06.697
Shit! Come on. Grab his legs.

44:06.809 --> 44:08.711
- He just called an ambulance.
- Grab his legs, goddammit!

44:08.913 --> 44:10.298
He stays here, he's gone.

44:11.174 --> 44:13.300
Take it easy, buddy. We're
gonna get you to a hospital.

44:13.450 --> 44:14.981
You're gonna be fine. You hear me?

44:15.067 --> 44:17.789
Get these guys to the barn. Let's go!

44:18.087 --> 44:20.865
Stay awake. You hear
me, stay awake, kid.

44:22.765 --> 44:25.038
Hey! Hey, keep your eyes open.

44:25.108 --> 44:26.923
- Stay awake.
- Come on, buddy. Come on!

44:27.198 --> 44:30.907
Your mom wants you to come home, man.
She wants you to stay alive for her, right?

44:31.598 --> 44:32.919
For the revolution.

44:33.175 --> 44:34.356
Shit.

44:37.441 --> 44:39.425
You're not gonna die on me.

44:39.717 --> 44:41.579
I'm not gonna let you die.

44:41.661 --> 44:44.867
We're almost there. You'll be fine.

44:45.666 --> 44:47.052
We need a doctor here!

44:47.540 --> 44:49.118
- A doctor, goddammit!
- Move!

44:49.191 --> 44:50.858
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

44:50.946 --> 44:52.723
Gunshot. He's bad. He needs help.

44:52.898 --> 44:54.444
I'll page a doctor.

44:56.769 --> 44:58.014
Ah, shit.

45:01.322 --> 45:03.323
Corrine. Corrine!

45:09.188 --> 45:10.414
Corrine, i need you.

45:39.444 --> 45:42.006
Lem, in your dream, was there blood?

45:42.760 --> 45:44.379
Your dream was...

45:48.156 --> 45:50.373
In your dream, did lem...

45:51.312 --> 45:53.182
What is it? What's going on?

46:04.787 --> 46:07.187
We're cops. Leave him alone, all right?
