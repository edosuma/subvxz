00:05.200 --> 00:09.233
The doctor said that we needed
to cut the dead skin,

00:09.266 --> 00:12.100
and I was awake
when he started cutting.

00:12.133 --> 00:14.300
I kept asking him,
"I have MRSA."

00:14.333 --> 00:16.400
He told my mom
that I was delusional.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.200
This is right up there

00:18.233 --> 00:20.400
as one of the craziest
stories we've ever heard.

00:20.433 --> 00:24.567
I've had so much surgery
that no Irish doctor will
actually work with my anymore.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.233
I started noticing
a rippling effect,

00:27.266 --> 00:30.166
and my breast on the right
is slightly higher than the one
on the left.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.600
How are you?
[squeals]
How are you doing?

00:31.633 --> 00:33.233
Oh, I get a hug. Oh.

00:33.266 --> 00:34.600
Almost knocked me over.
Hi, Ava.

00:34.633 --> 00:36.233
Is Dr. Nassif single?
He should be single.

00:36.266 --> 00:37.567
[laughing]

00:37.600 --> 00:39.600
My nose
was completely shattered.

00:39.633 --> 00:42.333
You need a complete
septal reconstruction.

00:42.367 --> 00:45.533
That's the hardest problem
in plastic surgery.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.433
[Dr. Nassif]
Oh, you got
some blood going down.

00:47.467 --> 00:51.333
What's his blood pressure?
It's high.

I had to mentally prepare myself
to make this video.

I'm 29 years old,
and I'm from Houston, Texas.

01:25.266 --> 01:28.233
As a teenager,
I loved to dress up.

01:28.266 --> 01:30.667
And I definitely
sneaked out of the house,

01:30.700 --> 01:33.300
and I would just go to parties.

01:33.333 --> 01:36.066
When I first got pregnant,
I was 17.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.533
I gained 81 pounds.

01:37.567 --> 01:40.667
And then I got
pregnant again at 21.

01:40.700 --> 01:46.100
My husband, David, said
that he actually really liked
the way my body was,

01:46.133 --> 01:50.367
but, at the same time,
he was out cheating on me.

01:50.400 --> 01:55.066
I felt betrayed,
and really, really insecure.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.533
I just didn't wanna
get cheated on anymore.

01:57.567 --> 02:03.200
I wanted to show Dave that,
like, hey, like, your wife
is pretty too.

02:03.233 --> 02:07.333
Like, kind of like, look at me.

02:07.367 --> 02:10.500
That is when I went
to a plastic surgeon in Mexico.

02:10.533 --> 02:13.266
I wanted a full mommy makeover,

02:13.300 --> 02:19.100
which would be a breast lift,
implants, if needed,
and a tummy tuck.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.233
After my surgery,
the next day,

02:21.266 --> 02:24.333
the doctor comes in
and removes my girdle.

02:24.367 --> 02:26.567
My stomach was black
at this point.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.533
Like, when a banana goes bad,
it's black. It was black.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.700
He said that we needed
to cut the dead skin,

02:33.734 --> 02:37.500
and I was awake
when he started cutting.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.066
I was really scared.
I didn't know what was going on.

that he was cutting more,

When I came back from Mexico,
I was recovering
in my mom's house.

I felt like I was going to die.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.166
And...

03:01.200 --> 03:04.200
I didn't see my kids
for four months,

03:04.233 --> 03:06.400
because I didn't want
anybody to see me.

03:06.433 --> 03:10.500
I felt hopeless,
and I was, like, smelly.

03:10.533 --> 03:15.133
And the hospitals
didn't want to see me
because I went to Mexico.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.367
After the four months

he would change my dressings.

I felt like he was a dog
for doing what he did.

And he apologized,
and I forgave him,

03:30.467 --> 03:32.266
because he's the father
of my kids.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.633
My relationship with David
got better.

03:34.667 --> 03:37.200

done that before.

I lock my door

from my stomach,

"Oh, we can't help you."

but I like everything bigger.

I'm most well known
as being Ireland's top model,

05:07.300 --> 05:10.467
but I've had so much surgery
that no Irish doctor

05:10.500 --> 05:12.300
will actually work
with me anymore.

05:12.333 --> 05:16.000
I go against all of their laws
and regulations.

05:16.033 --> 05:18.500
I've had two
breast augmentations,

05:18.533 --> 05:20.767
two ass augmentations.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.467
I've had liposuction
to my stomach,
liposuction to my back,

05:24.500 --> 05:26.400
two sets of veneers,

05:26.433 --> 05:30.333
PermaLip implant,
lip fillers on top of that,

05:30.367 --> 05:32.600
Botox, tan injections.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.633
I would get a lot of people
who would say,

05:34.667 --> 05:37.367
"Oh, she's overdone it."
"She's fake." "She's plastic."

05:37.400 --> 05:38.600
But, hey,
at the end of the day,

05:38.633 --> 05:40.600
I just look better naked
than most.

05:40.633 --> 05:43.033
I was the oldest of 12 kids.

05:43.066 --> 05:45.433
I was such an ugly duckling.

05:45.467 --> 05:49.500
There came to a stage in my life
where I had three babies,

05:49.533 --> 05:51.734
and I gained a lot of weight.

05:51.767 --> 05:54.667
I was 220 pounds.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.500
That is so huge
for someone of my height.

05:57.533 --> 06:01.233
I was just sick of the person
that I was looking at.

06:01.266 --> 06:03.433
I just decided
my life's gonna change.

06:03.467 --> 06:06.333
Five years ago,
I started going to the gym,

06:06.367 --> 06:09.266
I started dieting,
and I actually lost
all of my weight.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.633
When I first got
my first breast augmentation,

06:11.667 --> 06:15.367
I just wanted to fix myself
after having a baby
and breastfeeding.

06:15.400 --> 06:19.066
But then I started getting
really good offers

06:19.100 --> 06:21.700
from photographers
that wanted to work with me.

06:21.734 --> 06:24.400
Every time I get
something new done,

06:24.433 --> 06:26.667
my career has jumped
sensationally.

06:26.700 --> 06:30.000
I stand out more than
any of the rest of the models,

06:30.033 --> 06:32.500
because I've had
quite a lot of cosmetic surgery.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.500
When I go home, I'm a mom.

06:34.533 --> 06:38.667
I change dirty nappies,
I do dinners, housework.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.100
But when I'm out,
I'm living the dream life.

06:41.133 --> 06:44.300
I'm in the VIP areas,
invited to all
the nicest parties.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.467
I've been
all over the world.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.533
I've partied with A-listers.

06:48.567 --> 06:52.467
Like, if I was average,
if I was normal
like I used to be,

06:52.500 --> 06:54.467
I would not get
them opportunities.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.367
Nobody would even think,
by looking at me,

06:56.400 --> 06:57.700
that I even had children.

06:57.734 --> 07:00.066
So it is a completely
different lifestyle.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.567
I wanna see Dr. Dubrow
and Dr. Nassif

07:02.600 --> 07:06.100
because I wanna be one of
the biggest models in the world,

07:06.133 --> 07:09.333
so my body
needs to be perfection.

07:09.367 --> 07:11.700
I started noticing
a rippling effect,

07:11.734 --> 07:14.700
and my breast on the right
is slightly higher
than the one on the left.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.033
They are 890 CC,

07:17.066 --> 07:21.633
and I want them at about
a minimum of about 1,200 CC.

07:21.667 --> 07:24.567
I don't see an issue
with them being
double the size of my head.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.467
Big ass, big boobs,
small waist.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.400
I think that's perfection.
That's what I'm into.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.066
Who wants to look
like a basic bitch?

07:32.100 --> 07:34.000

07:38.400 --> 07:42.033
You ever look forward to,
honestly, you,

07:42.066 --> 07:45.166
once and for all,
having a girlfriend?

07:45.200 --> 07:47.000
Is this ever
going to happen?

07:47.033 --> 07:48.467
Are you ever gonna
have a girlfriend?

07:48.500 --> 07:50.467
Rather than the--
Well--

07:50.500 --> 07:53.333
...girl du jour--
I kind of-- You know,
I'm working on someone.

07:53.367 --> 07:55.600
Yeah, I know who
you're working on now,
but that one's a supermodel.

07:55.633 --> 07:58.500
Yeah?
What are you saying?
So,

07:58.533 --> 08:00.600
that supermodel's
gonna be your girlfriend?

08:00.633 --> 08:03.367
Are you saying that
I'm below her standards?

wanna date Harry Styles,

Oh.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.467
Oh! Jeepers creepers.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.734
So she lost
all of the skin--
Jeez, jeez, jeez.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.367
...between her belly button
and her pubic hairline.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.066
Yeah. It's a tough case.
Why don't you bring
Crystal in,

08:22.100 --> 08:24.200
and let's figure out
what happened
and what we can do about it.

08:24.233 --> 08:27.500
Okay. Can you please
send in Crystal?

08:27.533 --> 08:28.767
Crystal.
Hi.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.533
How are you?
I'm Dr. Nassif.
Hi. Crystal.

08:30.567 --> 08:32.133
Hi, Crystal. Terry Dubrow.
How are you?

08:32.166 --> 08:34.767
My mother thinks
that Dr. Dubrow
and Dr. Nassif

08:35.000 --> 08:38.667
are such a great team together,
but I'm scared
of being rejected by them

08:38.700 --> 08:41.500
and adding them to, like,
my "no" list.

08:41.533 --> 08:46.033
What happened?
So, I had two pregnancies,
and I gained a lot of weight.

08:46.066 --> 08:49.633
And at that time,
my husband was, like,
cheating on me a lot.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.433
Cheating on you a lot?
Yeah.

08:52.467 --> 08:55.767
So I wanted to get sexy,
like, so I was looking into

08:56.000 --> 08:58.433
mommy makeovers,
and a fat transfer.
Yeah.

08:58.467 --> 08:59.533
[Dr. Dubrow]
To?
My butt.

08:59.567 --> 09:01.400
Okay. A Brazilian butt lift.
Right.

09:01.433 --> 09:03.467
Okay.
It breaks my heart
that Crystal wanted

09:03.500 --> 09:05.133
to feel more attractive
to her husband.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.400
She didn't need
plastic surgery at all.

09:07.433 --> 09:10.400
This just goes to show
you should never, ever

09:10.433 --> 09:13.166
do plastic surgery
for another person.

09:13.200 --> 09:17.200
So I saw
a doctor in Houston.
He said $30,000.

09:17.233 --> 09:19.633
That's probably about right.
That's about right.

09:19.667 --> 09:22.600
So I said, "I'm never gonna have
that type of money." Right.
[Dubrow] A lot of money.

09:22.633 --> 09:26.066
And he said,
"I have a colleague
that operates in Mexico."

09:26.100 --> 09:28.000
So we saw him.

09:28.033 --> 09:31.233
He told me everything
I wanted to hear for $10,000.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.533
Good deal.

09:32.567 --> 09:34.633
I had to go to Mexico, though.
Yeah.

09:34.667 --> 09:37.667
We go into the surgery,
and as soon as I woke up,

09:37.700 --> 09:39.400
I had dead skin.
Ugghh!

09:39.433 --> 09:41.200
Right away?
Yes. Right away.

09:41.233 --> 09:44.033
Although it's possible
to have some skin

09:44.066 --> 09:48.166
die postoperatively,
if it happens immediately,

09:48.200 --> 09:50.500
it's really indicative
of only one thing,

09:50.533 --> 09:54.567
and that's improperly done
surgical technique,

09:54.600 --> 09:56.133
and you killed the tissue.

09:56.166 --> 09:59.033
You know when a kid draws,
like, a Christmas tree?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.200
[Dubrow] Yes.
Okay, so my stomach
was like that.

10:01.233 --> 10:04.066
All this was, like,
black and purple, right away.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.700
Right away?
Yeah.

10:05.734 --> 10:08.266
He said, "Okay, take a seat,"
in his filthy office,

10:08.300 --> 10:10.667
and he is cutting me.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.000
I can't feel--
Like, cutting the skin?

10:13.033 --> 10:15.000
All of it.
He was just cutting
and cutting.

10:15.033 --> 10:17.433
So I kept asking him,
"I have MRSA."

10:17.467 --> 10:21.500
He told my mom that I needed
to stay off the Internet--
that I was delusional.

10:21.533 --> 10:25.166
This is right up there
as one of the craziest stories
we've ever heard.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.066
And you weren't
on antibiotics?
No.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.600
Ugh! Where was
the lipo marked?
Um, my back fat.

10:30.633 --> 10:33.500
And I wanted lipo here,
so he marked that too.

10:33.533 --> 10:37.100
Lipo here and here? And did
a tummy tuck at the same time?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

10:37.133 --> 10:39.600
Do you wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
Yeah.

10:39.633 --> 10:43.700
When you do a tummy tuck,
you make an incision like this,
you lift this up.

10:43.734 --> 10:46.533
So where do you think
the blood supply is coming from?
Here.

10:46.567 --> 10:49.266
Where did you
have liposuction?
Here.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.633
This is called
the "intercostal blood supply."

10:51.667 --> 10:54.133
You never liposuction this.

10:54.166 --> 10:59.200
It is killing
the oxygen delivery system
to the skin,

10:59.233 --> 11:04.066
and it predictably
will die instantly.
Right.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.166
[Nassif]
I know some great doctors
in Mexico,

11:06.200 --> 11:10.066
but if you're going
for the deep
discounted surgeon,

11:10.100 --> 11:12.066
you're gonna have problems.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.100
Crystal is extremely lucky
to be alive.

11:14.133 --> 11:16.700
I saw, like, 20 surgeons.

11:16.734 --> 11:18.600
Everybody said,
"We can't help you."

11:18.633 --> 11:20.633
Like, "There's nothing
we can do for you."

11:20.667 --> 11:25.166
So 20 board-certified
plastic surgeons

11:25.200 --> 11:28.033
have told you
this is too risky.

11:28.066 --> 11:31.767
And you're both out here
wanting us--
[chuckling]

11:32.000 --> 11:33.767
...plastic surgeons 21,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.100
to say "yes."
Yes.

11:37.133 --> 11:39.166
So your goal, basically,
is what, just to close it?

11:39.200 --> 11:42.000
Get closed
and feel normal again.

11:42.033 --> 11:44.133
I don't wanna hide anymore.

11:45.667 --> 11:49.734
[voice breaking]
I want people to see
who I really am.

11:49.767 --> 11:52.133
I feel like
a monster sometimes.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.233
Like, before,
it wasn't for me.

11:54.266 --> 11:56.300
It's for me now.

11:59.066 --> 12:03.166
You have the hardest problem
in plastic surgery.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.200
That's at risk
for reoperation,

12:05.233 --> 12:08.133
and the whole thing--
[imitates explosion].

12:08.166 --> 12:12.567
If 20 surgeons are telling you
it's not possible,

12:12.600 --> 12:14.700
I got news for you.

12:17.734 --> 12:20.233
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

12:25.433 --> 12:28.100
[Dubrow]
Stand up for a second, please.

12:29.133 --> 12:31.100
Ideally, what we want to do--

12:31.133 --> 12:33.133
we call it
"recreating the defect."

12:33.166 --> 12:37.066
This is the basic principle
of this kind
of revisional surgery.

12:37.100 --> 12:39.066
The abdominal wall defect
that you see

12:39.100 --> 12:42.367
never really represents
the actual defect

12:42.400 --> 12:44.266
that you're gonna find
during surgery,

12:44.300 --> 12:46.300
because once
you release the tissue,

12:46.333 --> 12:50.200
the defect actually
increases dramatically,

12:50.233 --> 12:52.667
and that really defines
what area

12:52.700 --> 12:55.767
you have to close
and what your goals are.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.667
So the big question is,
do you have enough skin

12:58.700 --> 13:02.233
to get this tissue
down here

13:02.266 --> 13:04.367
without pulling up
the pubic skin

13:04.400 --> 13:06.633
and everything
that goes along with that--
Right.

13:06.667 --> 13:09.233
...and distorting
that area?

13:09.266 --> 13:14.433
You know, if 20 surgeons
are telling you
it's not possible,

13:14.467 --> 13:16.367
I got news for you.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.066
Twenty surgeons
may be wrong.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.500
[Crystal]
I'm really happy,

13:19.533 --> 13:23.066
because Dr. Dubrow
is going to operate on me.

13:23.100 --> 13:26.000
And they knew what was wrong
with me from the beginning,

13:26.033 --> 13:30.033
and that just makes me feel
like they can fix me.

13:30.066 --> 13:31.433
Will I have a belly button?

13:31.467 --> 13:34.166
Some people have called me
the "belly button whisperer."

13:34.200 --> 13:37.500
I don't know about that,
but I'm gonna have
a little conversation

13:37.533 --> 13:40.467
with that belly button
that you do have, which is
sort of there, sort of not.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.266
A belly button whisperer?

13:42.300 --> 13:44.133
That's what you call yourself?

13:44.166 --> 13:46.367
That's just stupid.
That's just plain old stupid.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.066
No other way to say it,
but this is
a high-risk procedure.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.433
Mom, what's your gut
tell you?

13:50.467 --> 13:52.467
I have a good feeling.
You do have a good feeling?

13:52.500 --> 13:54.333
So do I.
I do too.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.433
Yes.
[Dubrow]
Yeah?

13:56.467 --> 13:58.500
Hopefully, not only will I
have a gorgeous smile,

13:58.533 --> 14:00.767
I'll have a gorgeous tummy
to match it.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.767
Keep smiling.
Smile the whole way
through this, and you will heal.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.433
I can see it, okay?
Thank you.

14:05.467 --> 14:08.166
Thank you.
Thank you.

14:10.567 --> 14:14.367
[woman]
The doggies.
What's the doggy say?

14:14.400 --> 14:16.166
[girl]
Woof, woof.
Ruff, ruff, ruff.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.166
I'm Kenny.
I live in San Diego

14:18.200 --> 14:20.500
with my beautiful wife
and 15-month-old daughter.

14:20.533 --> 14:24.166
And living the dream,
other than my busted nose.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.300
The right side caves in
when I breathe.
[inhales]

14:26.333 --> 14:29.033
It's smashed in the middle,
and it has, like,

14:29.066 --> 14:32.333
a point at the front,
which is completely
unattractive.

14:32.367 --> 14:34.433
I was born and raised
in Cincinnati, Ohio.

14:34.467 --> 14:38.066
Pretty normal childhood,
other than breaking my nose
when I was in third grade.

14:38.100 --> 14:41.200
I remember the playground
very well, where
this accident happened.

14:41.233 --> 14:43.400
I like to say that I
was sitting there talking
to a couple of girls

14:43.433 --> 14:46.000
you know, of course,
and all of a sudden,

14:46.033 --> 14:48.000
bam, the concrete
came really fast.

14:48.033 --> 14:49.500
I didn't even know
what happened.

14:49.533 --> 14:52.767
And found out later
that the very large kid
in our class

14:53.000 --> 14:55.433
had run right into
the back of me,
coming downhill.

14:55.467 --> 14:57.200
Couldn't stop.
Just smack.

14:57.233 --> 14:59.166
My nose
was completely shattered.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.166
I was basically rushed in
to an emergency surgery

15:02.200 --> 15:03.500
to piece my nose together.

15:03.533 --> 15:05.367
When I woke up from surgery,

15:05.400 --> 15:08.500
my nose didn't look
like it did before.

15:08.533 --> 15:12.066
And it got worse over time,
as I was growing,
'cause my nose kept growing.

15:12.100 --> 15:15.467
By the time I was 17,
my mom goes, "We need to get
this thing fixed."

15:15.500 --> 15:17.166
I was about
to go off to college,

15:17.200 --> 15:19.233
meet new people, meet girls,
so I was on board.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.133
The surgeon that did
my rhinoplasty

15:21.166 --> 15:24.166
was referred to us
by my grandmother.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.100
She actually had some
sinus work done by him,

15:27.133 --> 15:29.000
and she was happy,
so that's where we went.

15:29.033 --> 15:31.200
When I woke up after surgery,
it was amazing.

15:31.233 --> 15:34.500
And then I went off to college,
and freshman year was great.

15:34.533 --> 15:38.100
But right around
my mid-sophomore year,

15:38.133 --> 15:42.233
I started to notice
that my nose was sinking
a little on one side.

15:42.266 --> 15:45.533
And with that sink,
it started to get
a little more crooked,

15:45.567 --> 15:47.300
and that was when
I called my mom.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.767
She wanted me to go see
the doctor again.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.066
Absolutely not.
I wasn't having it.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.500
I'll live with it,
and I'll mask it.
I'll laugh it off.

15:54.533 --> 15:56.633
I'll tell people
right out the gate
when I meet 'em,

15:56.667 --> 15:59.133
"Hey, I had my nose broken,
I've had it fixed,"

15:59.166 --> 16:02.166
and kind of use it as a,
you know, conversation piece.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.100
So, a few years ago,
my wife and I hosted

16:05.133 --> 16:07.467
a pumpkin-carving party
at our house

16:07.500 --> 16:10.467
and had a bunch of our friends
over, and my friend Dave,
who's a jokester,

16:10.500 --> 16:13.266
decided he wanted to make
a Kenny-o'-lantern.

16:13.300 --> 16:17.400
The stem was like one of
those big, crooked stems
on the pumpkin,

16:17.433 --> 16:20.000
and he used that for the nose,
and it was really funny.

16:20.033 --> 16:21.433
But at the same time,
it's like, "Ehh..."

16:21.467 --> 16:24.400
So, one of these days,
hopefully,

16:24.433 --> 16:26.533
I won't have to worry
about that stuff anymore.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.633
Hey, let's stop over here.
[sniffs]

16:28.667 --> 16:32.467
My right nostril
keeps clicking.
[sighs]

16:32.500 --> 16:35.100
[woman]
You wanna go on the swings?
[Kenny] Come on, kiddo.

16:35.133 --> 16:38.300
Here, you take her.
I'm gonna get her some crackers.
Okay. Okay.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.166
[coos]
You ready to go swing?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.433
My daughter, Cora,
was born about 15 months ago,

16:42.467 --> 16:44.567
and Cora and I
are identical.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.066
We have the same hair,
we have the same ears,
we have the same eyes,

16:47.100 --> 16:49.500
and we had the same nose,
as babies, as well.

16:49.533 --> 16:53.533
So that triggered me
to wanna get back
to a normal nose

16:53.567 --> 16:55.333
so then I look
even more like her.

16:55.367 --> 16:57.367
Yum-yum.
[smacking lips]
It will be nice

16:57.400 --> 16:59.500
to have you chew
with your mouth closed.

16:59.533 --> 17:01.433
Hopefully the new nose
will help with that.
Well, yeah. [sniffs]

17:01.467 --> 17:05.633
[laughs]
Kenny chews with his mouth open,
and I would like to believe

17:05.667 --> 17:08.367
that it's because he can't
breathe through his nose,
so he has to open his mouth.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.467
So I'm really hoping
that Dr. Nassif
can fix that problem.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.400
It does drive me nuts that
he chews with his mouth open,

17:14.433 --> 17:16.433
like our 15-month-old daughter,
Cora.

17:16.467 --> 17:19.200
I'm hoping that he can tell me,
"Yes, I can fix it."

17:19.233 --> 17:22.367
Dr. Nassif is one of
the best in the world,
so I guess we'll see.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.533
Exciting.
Yeah.

17:23.567 --> 17:25.266
Love you either way.
Thank you.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.667
New nose, old nose...

17:26.700 --> 17:29.333
It's been almost 18 years
since I had that surgery.

17:29.367 --> 17:31.600
It's time to finally
get this thing fixed.

17:31.633 --> 17:36.066
Cora growing up,
she'll be able to just know me
as having our nose.

17:36.100 --> 17:38.633
She can say,
"Yes, that's my dad.
We look exactly the same."

17:38.667 --> 17:42.066
And maybe I'll become
a little more attractive to
my wife, which would be nice.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.100
And I might mess with her
a little bit after,

17:44.133 --> 17:46.333
and if I can breathe
through my nose perfectly,

17:46.367 --> 17:49.166
I'll probably still chew
with my mouth open.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.133
So, our next patient, Kenny,

17:51.166 --> 17:53.400
at the age of 8,
broke his nose or something.

17:53.433 --> 17:55.166
So what happened?
He had trauma at 8--

17:55.200 --> 17:57.467
So he had some surgery
at the age of 17 to correct it.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.333
And-- Okay.
Oh, my--

17:59.367 --> 18:01.633
This is the result
of nasal surgery?

18:01.667 --> 18:03.633
That's like a boxer's nose.
[imitates
boxing blows landing]

18:03.667 --> 18:06.100
I'm hoping it looked
a lot worse before surgery,

18:06.133 --> 18:07.734
otherwise that doctor
is a disaster.

18:07.767 --> 18:09.533
Can you please
send in Kenny?

18:11.633 --> 18:14.433
Kenny, hi. Dr. Nassif.
Pleasure.
Nice to meet you.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.700
Hi, Kenny. Terry Dubrow.
How are you? Nice to meet you.
How are you?

18:16.734 --> 18:19.467
I've had people ask me
if I'm a boxer,
if I'm a fighter.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.100
"What happened to your nose?"
I just wanna move on.

18:22.133 --> 18:24.100
I don't wanna
have these questions
asked to me anymore.

18:24.133 --> 18:26.433
[Nassif]
Where'd you guys come in from?
San Diego.

18:26.467 --> 18:30.266
Good nightlife, San Diego.
Yeah, we have a 1-year-old,
so we don't know anymore.

18:30.300 --> 18:33.133
[Dubrow] So you had
some nasal trauma
at age 8, right?
Yes.

18:33.166 --> 18:35.700
I got ran into
by the very large kid
from our class.

18:35.734 --> 18:38.233
It was nose to pavement.
Shattered it.
Mm.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.367
[Kenny]
Went in,
they did what they could.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.667
Put it back together,
basically.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.166
And then, during my
senior year of high school,

18:44.200 --> 18:46.567
I had the procedure done,
'cause I was finished growing,

18:46.600 --> 18:49.367
and they could actually operate
and get it fixed.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.734
So what happened there?
So I went in for the surgery,
and afterwards, it was fine.

18:52.767 --> 18:57.266
And then over the years,
it's just sinking in.
Aahh.

18:57.300 --> 19:00.667
Have you ever heard of the word
"saddle nose deformity"?
No, I never heard that.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.433
When you have
a saddle nose deformity,
you have a collapse

19:03.467 --> 19:06.233
of the cartilaginous
part right here.

19:06.266 --> 19:08.400
Once that happens,
it just caves right in.

19:08.433 --> 19:11.233
That's why
this collapses right here,
because this is bone,

19:11.266 --> 19:13.533
this right here
is the cartilage part,

19:13.567 --> 19:15.533
and then here's your tip.
Right.

19:15.567 --> 19:18.233
So you guys met when?
2011.

19:18.266 --> 19:19.600
What do you think
about his nose?

19:19.633 --> 19:22.433
I mean, I didn't know,
when I met him.

19:22.467 --> 19:25.700
But we were, you know,
under the influence, so...
[laughing]

19:25.734 --> 19:31.333
We met at a bar.
He was so right out front, like,
"My nose is all jacked up."

19:31.367 --> 19:32.700
When you first met her,
you told her that.

19:32.734 --> 19:34.300
Interesting.
I just throw it out there.

19:34.333 --> 19:35.633
Just get it over with.
Yeah.

19:35.667 --> 19:38.567
Socially, Kenny is always fun--

19:38.600 --> 19:40.266
laughing, making jokes.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.667
But I do think that his humor

19:42.700 --> 19:45.767
kind of masks
what he's really feeling
about his nose.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.300
What are your goals,
specifically, with surgery?

19:48.333 --> 19:51.300
When Cora was born,
my baby picture and her
baby picture-- identical.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.400
[Nassif]
Same nose?
Yeah.

19:52.433 --> 19:54.333
So, that kind of
triggered me

19:54.367 --> 19:56.533
to want to get back
to a normal nose

19:56.567 --> 19:59.266
so then I look
even more like her.
Here's our next step.

19:59.300 --> 20:02.000
We'll go in
the examination room, we'll
take a look at your septum,

20:02.033 --> 20:04.467
see why it's collapsed,
see how much cartilage
you have in there,

20:04.500 --> 20:06.734
and then see what we can do,
if we decide to go in.
Sure.

20:06.767 --> 20:09.567
Okay? Let's go do that.
That'd be great. Yeah.
Thank you.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.433
[woman]
Do people stop and stare
when you're at home?

20:13.467 --> 20:15.033
People's jaws just drop.
Drop.

20:15.066 --> 20:18.734
They're just looking
straight up at the titties.

20:18.767 --> 20:21.266
This is a bit
of a daunting case.

20:21.300 --> 20:25.333
What you want
is this part, right here,
to bleed when you wipe it.

20:25.367 --> 20:26.700
[Bleep].

20:30.000 --> 20:32.100
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

20:35.300 --> 20:37.600
[Nassif]
So, obviously,
you have a deviated septum.

20:37.633 --> 20:40.100
Okay, breathe in for us.
[inhales]

20:40.133 --> 20:43.000
Even this side's not
getting opened up here.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.633
Is there something there?
Nope.

20:45.667 --> 20:48.033
There are three layers
to the nose: skin,

20:48.066 --> 20:51.367
cartilage-- which is
the structural support--
and the internal lining.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.533
Kenny's nose is really missing
two of those three.

20:54.567 --> 20:57.600
This is going to be
an extremely difficult case.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.600
First of all,
you need a complete
septal reconstruction.

21:00.633 --> 21:03.533
So we take out all this.
Mm-hmm.

21:03.567 --> 21:05.734
But we have to leave
a nice strut.

21:05.767 --> 21:07.500
We're gonna make
a little cut right here,

21:07.533 --> 21:09.033
take out a piece of rib.

21:09.066 --> 21:11.567
That's gonna help
to get your nose straight.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.300
Now, for your profile,

21:13.333 --> 21:15.066
this part here
needs to be built out,

21:15.100 --> 21:19.500
so we put something
called a diced cartilage
fascia graft

21:19.533 --> 21:22.567
and make a long incision
above your left ear

21:22.600 --> 21:23.734
take some of the tissue out.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.100
Then we take
some of the cartilage

21:25.133 --> 21:26.567
from wherever we get it.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.066
We roll it up like a burrito
and put it right here.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.734
It's very overwhelming
to hear all that.

21:30.767 --> 21:34.500
I did not anticipate
such a tough surgery.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.600
You have one of the things

21:36.633 --> 21:39.567
that gives us all
massive pause,

21:39.600 --> 21:42.467
which is the term
"saddle nose."

21:42.500 --> 21:45.600
That's the hardest problem
in plastic surgery.

21:45.633 --> 21:48.467
That's at risk
for reoperation,

21:48.500 --> 21:50.633
and the whole thing--
[imitates explosion].

21:50.667 --> 21:52.700
So what he's doing

21:52.734 --> 21:57.033
is super complex
and super risky.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.367
Now, under my watch,

21:58.400 --> 22:00.600
the goal is to get you
a lot better,

22:00.633 --> 22:02.533
a good 80% improvement.

22:02.567 --> 22:04.333
But can things still happen?

22:04.367 --> 22:05.433
Yeah.
Yes.

22:05.467 --> 22:06.467
What do you want to do?

22:06.500 --> 22:07.734
I know I want to do it.

22:07.767 --> 22:09.467
I have confidence in you.
Good. Thank you.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.500
A hundred percent.

22:10.533 --> 22:11.767
It actually makes me glad

22:12.000 --> 22:14.033
that we didn't go back
before.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.467
That's what I was just
about to tell you.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.433
You didn't have a mere mortal--
Right.

22:17.467 --> 22:18.600
...try to fix this,

22:18.633 --> 22:20.200
'cause you need
a superhero now.

22:20.233 --> 22:22.033
You need a guy

Beauty Bar.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.467
I'm here to get a Vajazzle.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.100
There's nothing wrong
with a big of bling down there.

and shiny,

23:12.633 --> 23:14.166
and why not add some more?

23:14.200 --> 23:16.567
So how long have you guys
been friends?

23:16.600 --> 23:18.133
About five years.

23:18.166 --> 23:19.467
About five years, yeah.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.400
We were friends in
social media, actually,

23:22.433 --> 23:24.700
and I was getting a lot of--

23:24.734 --> 23:26.000
Negativity.

23:26.033 --> 23:27.433
Yeah. Abuse, basically.
Yeah.

23:27.467 --> 23:29.767
I'm going against everything

23:30.000 --> 23:31.433
that Ireland stands for.

23:31.467 --> 23:32.533
I don't want to be
a skinny Barbie.

23:32.567 --> 23:33.633
I want to be a curvy

23:33.667 --> 23:36.033
Kim Kardashian,
Nicki Minaj wannabe.

23:36.066 --> 23:38.233
So people can judge.
People can say what they want.

23:38.266 --> 23:39.567
But they're not
living my life.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.467
I've never been so happy.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.467
So do people stop and stare
when you're at home?

23:43.500 --> 23:46.033
Everywhere we walked,
people's jaws just drop.

23:46.066 --> 23:49.700
They're just looking
straight up at the titties.

23:49.734 --> 23:52.000
One of them
is slightly dropped,

23:52.033 --> 23:53.767
and this one here is
starting to, like, ripple.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.433
I'm 890 CC at the moment,

23:56.467 --> 23:59.767
but I'm thinking that I want
to be a minimum of 1,200.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.266
I'll be happy
once my boobs touch my chin

24:03.300 --> 24:05.600
and I can actually
drink my tea from my chest.

24:05.633 --> 24:06.767
Yay. I'm blinging.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.533
Yes, you're blinging.

24:08.567 --> 24:10.266
I've never put on
this many Vajazzles before.

24:10.300 --> 24:11.533
Ha ha!

24:13.667 --> 24:15.066
So how are you feeling?

24:15.100 --> 24:17.200
Nervous and scared,

24:17.233 --> 24:20.600
just ready, I guess,
to get it over with.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.500
I'm feeling okay.

24:22.533 --> 24:23.767
I look like crap.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
I can't wear hairspray.

24:25.033 --> 24:27.133
Crystal, how are you?

24:27.166 --> 24:28.166
Good to see you.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.700
And I'm smiling a lot

24:29.734 --> 24:31.133
because
I'm really nervous.

24:31.166 --> 24:33.734
Our challenge today
is this, Crystal.

24:33.767 --> 24:37.000
What we see here,
although very large,

24:37.033 --> 24:38.567
is only a small percentage

24:38.600 --> 24:40.700
of what we actually
have to fill.

24:40.734 --> 24:42.734
Once you make an incision
and open things up,

24:42.767 --> 24:46.033
it doubles or triples
the actual real defect.

24:46.066 --> 24:48.166
This is a bit
of a daunting case

24:48.200 --> 24:52.133
'cause your doctor
really went crazy
with the liposuction.

24:52.166 --> 24:54.467
The challenge with Crystal's
surgery today

24:54.500 --> 24:57.500
is that she has
a radical disruption

24:57.533 --> 25:00.500
of the blood supply
in her abdominal wall.

25:00.533 --> 25:03.300
It's very possible
I could lift everything up,

25:03.333 --> 25:04.700
bring it down,
and it could die

25:04.734 --> 25:06.734
right in front of my
very eyes as well.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.600
I'll begin Crystal's surgery

25:12.633 --> 25:15.066
by making an incision
across her lower abdomen

25:15.100 --> 25:16.734
to recreate
the original defect.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.500
Next, I'll carefully elevate

25:18.533 --> 25:21.033
her extremely thin
abdominal wall tissue,

25:21.066 --> 25:22.633
remove the excess skin,

25:22.667 --> 25:24.767
and then close the defect
once and for all.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Finally, I'll create
a new belly button,

25:27.033 --> 25:28.300
and Crystal
will have a stomach

25:28.333 --> 25:30.033
as pretty as her smile.

25:30.066 --> 25:32.100
Now it's show time.

25:32.133 --> 25:34.533
So it's time to what's
called in plastic surgery

25:34.567 --> 25:36.333
recreate the defect.

25:36.367 --> 25:37.767
There it goes.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.166
I've increased
the size of out defect

25:40.200 --> 25:41.367
5 centimeters,

25:41.400 --> 25:44.633
so now the defect
measures 14.

25:44.667 --> 25:47.533
14 centimeters
is 5 1/2 inches.

25:47.567 --> 25:49.200
That's
a really big defect,

25:49.233 --> 25:51.000
and I still have
a long way to go.

25:51.033 --> 25:52.300
This is such a thin
abdominal wall,

25:52.333 --> 25:54.100
you have to do this
with a scalpel.

25:54.133 --> 25:56.133
How many times have we had
to elevate abdominal walls

25:56.166 --> 25:57.367
with a scalpel?

25:57.400 --> 25:58.700
This is the first time.

25:58.734 --> 26:01.533
Normally, I use
an electrocautery device,

26:01.567 --> 26:04.100
but I can't have
any excess heat

26:04.133 --> 26:05.700
distributed
to the abdominal wall

26:05.734 --> 26:08.700
and risk injury
to the underlying intestines.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.000
I literally can
see your scalpel.

26:11.033 --> 26:12.166
Really?
[laughing]
Yes.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.767
How many fingers
am I holding up?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.266
Two.
Eh, you're right.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.266
Here's the scariest part
of the operation.

26:17.300 --> 26:20.300
We're now cutting off
the remaining blood supply

26:20.333 --> 26:22.233
that will determine
whether or not

26:22.266 --> 26:25.567
we have enough oxygen delivery
to keep this alive

26:25.600 --> 26:28.033
or whether we're gonna
suffer the same fate.

26:28.066 --> 26:29.400
The big question mark

26:29.433 --> 26:32.734
is can I preserve
enough blood supply

26:32.767 --> 26:34.400
for the wound to heal?

26:34.433 --> 26:37.667
If I don't, she's gonna
be back to square 1,

26:37.700 --> 26:39.367
and everything's
going to die.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.700
What you want
is this part right here

26:41.734 --> 26:43.700
to bleed when you wipe it.

26:43.734 --> 26:46.000
[Bleep].

26:46.033 --> 26:47.734
That's concerning.

26:47.767 --> 26:49.767
Wait.
Look at that.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.033
That's bleeding.

26:51.066 --> 26:54.567
Bleeding is good.

26:54.600 --> 26:58.300
Not bleeding...bad.

26:58.333 --> 27:00.300
Okay.
I can tell you one thing.

27:00.333 --> 27:02.266
It's not dying in front
of our very eyes.

27:02.300 --> 27:05.367
Crystal's surgery
technically went very well,

27:05.400 --> 27:08.767
but I don't know if it went
physiologically very well.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.333
Time will tell.
It's gonna either

27:10.367 --> 27:12.633
be blue and black tomorrow,

27:12.667 --> 27:14.433
or it's gonna be
pink and alive.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.233
I'm hoping for alive.

27:17.633 --> 27:18.700

my brother.

27:22.367 --> 27:23.700
Yes, he did it.

27:23.734 --> 27:25.200
I don't want to look

27:25.233 --> 27:27.433

walking down the road.

Basic bitch?

27:30.033 --> 27:31.100
I can relate to her
not being a basic B

I wanted to wear this,
but now I got to take it off.

You look like Dracula.
That's what I thought, too.

we push the tip back

28:11.233 --> 28:12.433
Do you like that idea,

28:12.467 --> 28:14.767
or do you want to keep
the height of everything

28:15.000 --> 28:16.133
and just fill in that?

28:16.166 --> 28:17.367
I don't know
that a smaller nose

28:17.400 --> 28:19.033
would fit my face.

28:19.066 --> 28:20.300
How tall are you?
6'2".

28:20.333 --> 28:22.033
And I'm 6'3".

28:22.066 --> 28:23.400
[laughing]
And I'm 6'5".

28:23.433 --> 28:25.033
Uh-huh.

28:25.066 --> 28:26.567
Maybe just soften this tip

28:26.600 --> 28:28.200
because you're tall.

28:28.233 --> 28:30.066
Keep this.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.400
Okay. We can do that.

28:36.567 --> 28:38.767
Today, for Kenny's surgery,
my team I will begin

28:39.000 --> 28:40.433
by harvesting a rib
from the chest

28:40.467 --> 28:42.467
and fascia from the scalp.

28:42.500 --> 28:45.333
Next, I will open the nose
and straighten the septum.

28:45.367 --> 28:47.266
Then I will insert
the diced cartilage fascia

28:47.300 --> 28:48.734
on the right side,

28:48.767 --> 28:50.367
filling in
the saddle nose deformity.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.066
Finally,
I'll rebuild Kenny's tip

28:52.100 --> 28:53.333
with the septal
extension graft

28:53.367 --> 28:54.433
to keep the nose straight,

28:54.467 --> 28:56.066
hopefully giving him a nose

28:56.100 --> 28:58.033
that's both familiar
and functional.

28:58.066 --> 29:00.367
Okay, so let's start
with the fascia

29:00.400 --> 29:03.567
while Dr. Ping
is working on the rib.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.433
Give me a pickup
square knife.

29:05.467 --> 29:06.767
Thank you.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.233
He's really oozy.

29:08.266 --> 29:09.333
Deep ooze.

29:09.367 --> 29:12.200
If Kenneth took some aspirin

29:12.233 --> 29:14.367
or Advil
or something like that,

29:14.400 --> 29:16.166
that's gonna cause
some bleeding,

29:16.200 --> 29:18.433
or if he was even
drinking some alcohol,

29:18.467 --> 29:20.100
especially red wine.

29:20.133 --> 29:23.100
Okay, so here's our fascia.

29:23.133 --> 29:24.767
And Dr. Ping took out the rib.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.033
5 rib.

29:26.066 --> 29:27.300
Let's start the nose.

29:29.166 --> 29:31.233
Ooh, we got some blood
going down.

29:31.266 --> 29:33.166
He likes to ooze.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.233
What's his blood pressure?

29:35.266 --> 29:36.567
It's high.
What is it?

29:36.600 --> 29:39.066
160.
I'll get him down.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.600
This is not
an emergency situation

29:40.633 --> 29:42.300
We're gonna give him
medications

29:42.333 --> 29:44.066
to drop his blood pressure,

29:44.100 --> 29:46.200
and then hopefully we'll
decrease some of the bleeding.

29:46.233 --> 29:48.266
So we opened up the nose.

29:48.300 --> 29:51.300
We are not gonna
have to perform

29:51.333 --> 29:54.100
a reconstruction septoplasty.

29:54.133 --> 29:57.000
The doctor that was
in the nose at the age of 17

29:57.033 --> 29:58.333
did a pretty good job,

29:58.367 --> 30:00.333
but we do have to add
a septal extension graft

30:00.367 --> 30:02.000
on the tip of the nose

30:02.033 --> 30:03.533
to keep the nose
from being crooked again.

30:03.567 --> 30:06.633
That just made a bigger
surgery a little bit smaller.

30:06.667 --> 30:09.533
The septum is done, though.

30:09.567 --> 30:13.233
So Dr. Ping is preparing
the diced cartilage fascia,

30:13.266 --> 30:15.600
so that's gonna go
along the entire dorsum,

30:15.633 --> 30:17.633
and this part here
will go along

30:17.667 --> 30:19.633
where the depression
of the nose is

30:19.667 --> 30:23.133
to build up
the part of the nose
that's collapsing in--

30:23.166 --> 30:25.600
basically, where
the saddle nose
deformity is.

30:25.633 --> 30:28.533
The diced cartilage fascia
graft looks great,

30:28.567 --> 30:30.367
so we're gonna
put in something

30:30.400 --> 30:32.433
to strengthen up
the right side

30:32.467 --> 30:34.333
where Kenneth's nose
is collapsing in,

30:34.367 --> 30:35.600
and we'll close up.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.567
Look at that. Boom.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.333
So we got the tip
a lot straighter.

30:42.367 --> 30:43.500
That looks fantastic.

30:43.533 --> 30:45.567
The middle part
of the nose is built up.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.300
Great job.

30:47.333 --> 30:48.400
Looks great.

30:48.433 --> 30:49.633
Thank you, thank you.

30:49.667 --> 30:51.266
Really happy
with Kenneth's nose.

30:51.300 --> 30:53.333
I mean, I don't have
the ego like Dubrow,

30:53.367 --> 30:56.166
but I do feel like a little
bit of a superhero today

30:56.200 --> 30:58.066
because I did come in
and save the day.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.333
So we have a patient
from Ireland.

31:06.367 --> 31:07.633
Ireland is not a place

31:07.667 --> 31:09.333
where I think about a lot
of plastic surgery.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.100
Right.
When you think of Ireland,

31:11.133 --> 31:13.533
you think about beautiful
countrysides and Scotch,

31:13.567 --> 31:15.133
but not big breasts.

31:15.166 --> 31:16.300
She's like an internet

31:16.333 --> 31:18.500
celebrity model type person

31:18.533 --> 31:20.500
who looks like she may have
had a lot of plastic surgery.
A lot.

31:20.533 --> 31:22.600
So would you call in
Ava Van Rose?

31:22.633 --> 31:24.166
Can you please send in Ava?

31:25.233 --> 31:27.166
Oh, my God. Hi.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.233
How are you?
Ava.

31:28.266 --> 31:29.400
How are you?
How are you doing?

31:29.433 --> 31:31.567
I get a hug. Oh.
Almost knocked me over.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.700
Hi, Ava.
How are you?

31:32.734 --> 31:34.166
How are you?
Nice to meet you.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.300
Dating a plastic surgeon.

31:35.333 --> 31:36.600
Wouldn't that be amazing?

31:36.633 --> 31:38.633
Is Dr. Nassif single?
He should be single.

31:38.667 --> 31:40.300
[giggling]

31:40.333 --> 31:42.667
I'm gonna have to work
my Irish charms on him.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.600
So you've had some plastic
surgery procedures.

31:45.633 --> 31:47.200
I've had.

31:47.233 --> 31:49.333
You have some concerns
about some areas.

31:49.367 --> 31:51.200
We want to know
where you started.

31:51.233 --> 31:53.467
My first
plastic surgery procedure
was I got my boobs done.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.133
What were your first size
implants?

31:55.166 --> 31:56.367
I was 400 CC.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.567
I just wanted to go natural.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.166
I just wanted
to fix myself

31:59.200 --> 32:00.500
'cause I had been a mom.

32:00.533 --> 32:03.300
I breastfed.
I lost a lot of weight.

32:03.333 --> 32:05.200
Ava, that's a great reason
to have a plastic surgery
procedure.

32:05.233 --> 32:06.333
Yeah.
But obviously,

32:06.367 --> 32:07.533
looking natural

32:07.567 --> 32:09.100
is in
the rear view mirror now.

32:09.133 --> 32:10.500
I went to Chapel Public,

32:10.533 --> 32:12.734
and I had liposuction
to my stomach,

32:12.767 --> 32:14.100
liposuction to my back.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.200
Okay.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.600
I had a 890 CC boob job.

32:17.633 --> 32:18.734
Okay.

32:18.767 --> 32:20.600
Then I had my ass
redone as well,

32:20.633 --> 32:22.500
so I got 600 CCs
in there.

32:22.533 --> 32:23.667
By the way,
that's a lot of surgery.

32:23.700 --> 32:25.233
Did you have it all
at one time?

32:25.266 --> 32:26.500
I had them
over the space of a year.

32:26.533 --> 32:28.300
Okay. Did you have
any complications?

32:28.333 --> 32:30.333
I'm starting to get
a rippling effect

32:30.367 --> 32:31.600
on the side of my breasts.

32:31.633 --> 32:33.400
This one has kind of
dropped slightly.

32:33.433 --> 32:34.533
It's lower.
Yes.

32:34.567 --> 32:35.734
Okay.
It's a big deal for me

32:35.767 --> 32:37.333
for my body
to look on point

32:37.367 --> 32:39.166
because I take pictures,

32:39.200 --> 32:41.266
so I still want to go larger.

32:41.300 --> 32:42.400
How much larger?

32:42.433 --> 32:43.533
1,200 CC.

32:43.567 --> 32:45.133
That's my dream goal.

32:45.166 --> 32:46.567
I don't want
to look like a mum.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.233
Right.
Do you know what I mean?

32:48.266 --> 32:49.400
I don't want to look
like I've had a baby.

32:49.433 --> 32:51.500
I don't find the mom bod
attractive.

32:51.533 --> 32:52.667
It's not my thing.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.266
I'm not frumpy.

32:54.300 --> 32:55.500
I'm thin, fabulous,

32:55.533 --> 32:56.734
and that's the way
it's gonna stay.

32:56.767 --> 32:59.400
My goal is to be
the most memorable

32:59.433 --> 33:01.600
Irish celebrity possible.

33:01.633 --> 33:06.500
Like, you're not gonna look
at some average basic bitch

33:06.533 --> 33:08.200
walking down the road
on a daily basis.

33:08.233 --> 33:09.333
Average basic--

33:09.367 --> 33:10.633
Bitch, yeah.
Basic bitch?

33:10.667 --> 33:12.433
A BB, yeah.
Well, like, yeah.

33:12.467 --> 33:14.567
I can relate to her
not being a basic B

33:14.600 --> 33:17.633
because I'm no basic D--
doctor.

33:17.667 --> 33:19.433
So let's go and have a look
and figure it out.

33:19.467 --> 33:21.467
Perfect. Yeah.
Let's go do that.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.300
It could potentially
make the rippling--

33:25.333 --> 33:26.300
Worse?
Worse.

33:26.333 --> 33:27.333
Yeah, I get you.

33:27.367 --> 33:29.700
My head
is spinning right now.

33:29.734 --> 33:32.000
The last time Crystal
had a tummy tuck,

33:32.033 --> 33:33.767
her skin died instantly.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.400
I'm a little bit nervous
about what I'm gonna find.

33:36.433 --> 33:38.600
As they say,
without further ado.

33:43.066 --> 33:45.266
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

33:48.266 --> 33:50.433
Do me a favor.
Sit forward a little bit.

33:50.467 --> 33:53.033
Put your hair back
so we can see your chest.

33:53.066 --> 33:55.233
Okay, so the first thing,
without even exposing,

33:55.266 --> 33:58.500
you can see you have
rippling on both sides. Okay?

33:58.533 --> 34:00.500
Ava isn't even disrobed yet,

34:00.533 --> 34:02.700
and we can see
very traumatic rippling.

34:02.734 --> 34:05.533
There's got to be a whole lot
of photo editing going on

34:05.567 --> 34:07.266
to hide these complications.

34:07.300 --> 34:11.033
The larger you go,
the thinner the skin gets,

34:11.066 --> 34:14.333
and it could potentially
make the rippling--

34:14.367 --> 34:15.433
Worse?
Worse.

34:15.467 --> 34:17.000
Yeah, I get you.
Right?

34:17.033 --> 34:18.533
So normally,
what we do for that

34:18.567 --> 34:20.033
is we switch to silicone,

34:20.066 --> 34:22.567
but they don't make silicone
bigger than 800,

34:22.600 --> 34:24.734
so it wouldn't meet your goal--
Yeah.

34:24.767 --> 34:26.467
...of going bigger.

34:26.500 --> 34:29.000
If you go bigger,
your chance of complication

34:29.033 --> 34:30.567
gets even higher.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.400
And by that, I mean
capsular contracture,

34:33.433 --> 34:36.367
scar tissue, or, worse,

34:36.400 --> 34:40.100
The implant wears its way
through the skin.

34:40.133 --> 34:41.433
Oh, my God.

34:41.467 --> 34:43.033
Exposes through--
You ever heard of this?

34:43.066 --> 34:45.033
No.
This is called
implant exposure,

34:45.066 --> 34:47.567
and then
you lose the implant.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.066
My head is spinning
right now.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.433
I feel sick.
My dreams are being

34:52.467 --> 34:53.700
smashed right now.

34:53.734 --> 34:56.433
We see that all the time,

34:56.467 --> 34:57.767
and then we're given the task

34:58.000 --> 34:59.767
of having to fix
those destroyed breasts.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.700
I can't risk that.

35:01.734 --> 35:03.100
Right.

35:03.133 --> 35:04.734
I've been so successful
as it stands.

35:04.767 --> 35:07.100
I can't risk going
through a procedure

35:07.133 --> 35:08.700
and coming out
the other end

35:08.734 --> 35:10.767
not looking better
than I went in.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.767
That was too easy.
You really mean this?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.433
I'm actually a bit upset

35:14.467 --> 35:16.100
because it's emotional
to hear,

35:16.133 --> 35:18.633
like, this is--
I'm actually-- I'm sorry--

35:18.667 --> 35:20.700
like you're not gonna
fulfill your dreams

35:20.734 --> 35:23.066
because it could
risk your health

35:23.100 --> 35:24.367
and maybe your life.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.166
Ava, it's fine to dream big,

35:26.200 --> 35:27.633
but dream safe.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.033
The good news for you

35:29.066 --> 35:31.433
is you actually have
soft breasts.

35:31.467 --> 35:33.033
You have symmetrical breasts.

35:33.066 --> 35:34.700
Your breasts are
a very good shape.

35:34.734 --> 35:36.700
But they're just
a little rippled.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.767
So what?
Maybe they're right.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.600
Maybe I don't need to change
anything anymore.

35:40.633 --> 35:43.100
Maybe I just need
to start feeling that.

35:43.133 --> 35:44.734
You're on a career path
right now.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.367
One thing you don't want to do

35:46.400 --> 35:47.734
is you don't want
to come back to him

35:47.767 --> 35:50.467
and say, "Please fix this."
"Fix me," yeah.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.367
After some time, you think,
"Maybe I will do it,"

35:52.400 --> 35:53.667
think about
what we've told you.

35:53.700 --> 35:54.700
Think about your kids.

35:54.734 --> 35:56.000
That combo together

35:56.033 --> 35:58.133
should block you
from doing anything

35:58.166 --> 35:59.467
and making a big mistake.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.433
I have to take
into consideration

36:01.467 --> 36:03.600
that there could be
major losses.

36:03.633 --> 36:05.767
Every so often,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.567
when you warn a patient
of complications,

36:10.133 --> 36:11.667
and that feels really good.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.767
It was honestly a great
pleasure to meet you guys.

36:14.000 --> 36:14.767
Thanks.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.100
Have fun while you're here.

36:16.133 --> 36:17.400
Oh, my God.
A pleasure.

Hello.
[Crystal]
Hi.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.100
[Dubrow]
Crystal.
Hi.

36:26.133 --> 36:27.700
How are you?
Good. Thank you.

36:27.734 --> 36:29.066
How are you?
Good.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.433
The last time Crystal
had a tummy tuck,

36:30.467 --> 36:32.467
her skin died instantly.

36:32.500 --> 36:36.633
It's only been 24 hours
since my surgical procedure,

36:36.667 --> 36:38.767
and I'm a little bit nervous
about what I'm gonna find

36:39.000 --> 36:40.100
underneath the dressings.

36:40.133 --> 36:42.500
So I made an incision,

36:42.533 --> 36:44.600
and I started elevating
up the tissue.

36:44.633 --> 36:46.200
I had to do that
with a scalpel,

36:46.233 --> 36:47.667
which I,
to be honest with you,

36:47.700 --> 36:49.633
never had to do before
with a tummy tuck.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.433
So you're the first.

36:51.467 --> 36:53.767
My worst fear at this point
would be dead skin.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.233
I've gone through it
once before,

36:55.266 --> 36:56.734
and it was hell,

36:56.767 --> 36:59.100
and I don't want to go
through any of that anymore.

36:59.133 --> 37:02.166
As they say,
without further ado.

37:04.133 --> 37:05.133
Hah!

37:05.166 --> 37:06.600
You're looking for that.

37:06.633 --> 37:08.133
It's beautiful.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.500
Completely alive.

37:09.533 --> 37:11.133
It's alive.

37:11.166 --> 37:13.166
I am just so happy

37:13.200 --> 37:15.500
that I didn't see any black
on my stomach,

37:15.533 --> 37:17.533
and I have a belly button,
so yeah.

37:17.567 --> 37:19.700
So all you have to do is heal,
not get an infection.

37:19.734 --> 37:21.166
I don't want to good-mouth it

37:21.200 --> 37:22.667
'cause a lot of negative
things can happen,

37:22.700 --> 37:24.700
but one of the negative
things that is on the list

37:24.734 --> 37:26.767
is not this dying.
Yeah.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.033
[deep sigh]

37:28.066 --> 37:29.266
I like it.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.567
Me, too. That is gonna
match this now

37:31.600 --> 37:32.700
from now on.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.033
[Crystal]
I'm really excited

37:38.066 --> 37:39.533
to spend the day
with my family.

37:39.567 --> 37:42.600
I have not gone out
with my kids

37:42.633 --> 37:45.767
and actually been able
to enjoy myself in years,

37:46.000 --> 37:47.667
but now I'm no longer hiding.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.567
There's nothing
holding me back.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.734
So have you seen
improvements with Crystal?

37:52.767 --> 37:54.166
She's a lot happier now.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.033
Yeah. Her smile is just
there all the time.

37:56.066 --> 37:57.033
She's always smiling.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.567
I've had to make

37:58.600 --> 38:00.066
a lot of corrections
to myself,

38:00.100 --> 38:02.266
and I feel very guilty.
I still do.

38:02.300 --> 38:04.433
She wouldn't have had
to go through anything

38:04.467 --> 38:06.100
if I wouldn't have
put her through it.

38:06.133 --> 38:07.567
I feel happy knowing

38:07.600 --> 38:09.700
that Dr. Dubrow
did help us out,

38:09.734 --> 38:11.166
so I'm grateful for that.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.066
Does she lock herself
in the bathroom anymore?

38:13.100 --> 38:14.500
You know she does that, too?

38:14.533 --> 38:15.667
Come on. I know everything.

38:15.700 --> 38:17.467
I'm her mom.
Yeah.

38:17.500 --> 38:21.200
Prior to the surgery,
I would lock the door.

38:21.233 --> 38:23.133
It's the total opposite now.

38:23.166 --> 38:25.600
I don't care
what door is locked.

38:25.633 --> 38:28.066
I don't care
what door is open.

38:28.100 --> 38:29.300
I just change.

38:29.333 --> 38:31.600
Oh, my God.
Here she comes.

38:31.633 --> 38:33.300
Mommy!

38:33.333 --> 38:34.633
Oh, my God.

38:34.667 --> 38:36.166
You're okay, right?

38:36.200 --> 38:39.734
It feels great to see
Crystal confident, smiling.

38:39.767 --> 38:41.000
It's a blessing.

38:41.033 --> 38:42.734
Can we thank Dr. Dubrow

38:42.767 --> 38:44.700
for being lucky number 21?
Yes.

38:44.734 --> 38:47.100
[both]
Thank you, Dr. Dubrow.

38:47.133 --> 38:48.533
Before my surgery,

38:48.567 --> 38:50.300
my stomach looked
like a Christmas tree.

38:50.333 --> 38:53.100
I had a huge gap
in my abdomen,

38:53.133 --> 38:55.200
and it made me hide
from my family.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.000
But now,
thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

38:57.033 --> 38:59.233
I have a flat stomach
that I love showing off.

38:59.266 --> 39:01.667
My family and I
have never been closer,

39:01.700 --> 39:04.633
and I can't stop smiling
for all the right reasons.

39:04.667 --> 39:06.533
I'm glad we're able
to do this, Ma.

39:06.567 --> 39:08.133

40:05.767 --> 40:07.233

40:07.266 --> 40:08.367
once I opened up the nose,

40:08.400 --> 40:10.000
your septum wasn't that bad.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.000
I made it
a little straighter.
Okay.

40:12.033 --> 40:13.233
And then I made
that fascia,

40:13.266 --> 40:14.734
the graft,
all the way through here

40:15.000 --> 40:16.333
to build up the middle
part of the nose.

will still do it

my original nose back.

is built up,

42:53.033 --> 42:54.767
and the right side
no longer collapses.

exactly the same.
