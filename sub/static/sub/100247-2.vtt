WEBVTT

00:04.892 --> 00:07.586
Dundee might be really
full-on for you.

00:07.587 --> 00:08.786
It's a really good job.

00:08.787 --> 00:10.946
This is Emma Hedges,
my new lab technician.

00:10.947 --> 00:14.346
Working on a study to develop
new tools and research

00:14.347 --> 00:17.666
around the analysis of new and
emerging street drugs in Scotland.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.626
You'll be studying a fictional case

00:19.627 --> 00:22.306
to teach you the principles
of forensic science.

00:22.307 --> 00:24.786
Professor Gordon.
The body in the MOOC's my mum.

00:24.787 --> 00:28.026
She went missing at a festival.
Three months later, she was dug up.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.746
We need to check the rest of the
MOOC for any other similarities.

00:30.747 --> 00:33.542
There was a fatal fire
at a club in Lockie last night.

00:33.543 --> 00:34.506
Three dead.

00:34.507 --> 00:36.826
The manager Shuggie Brook
jumped off the Tay Bridge

00:36.827 --> 00:38.106
the day before yesterday.

00:38.107 --> 00:40.226
Stay with me. I'm staying
at my mum's on my own.

00:40.227 --> 00:42.226
- Where's your mum?
- I think she's dying.

00:42.227 --> 00:46.346
My sweet Marie ended up dumped in
the ground with her bones cut up.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.626
You need to talk to the police.

00:47.627 --> 00:50.266
This is my mum and dad, except
at the time the photo was taken,

00:50.267 --> 00:53.026
my mum wasn't with my dad,
she was with my stepdad.

00:53.027 --> 00:56.866
I think it could have something
to do with her murder.

00:56.867 --> 01:01.387
♪ Baby, you understand me now

01:03.427 --> 01:08.947
♪ If sometimes you see that I'm mad

01:09.027 --> 01:16.187
♪ Don't you know that no-one

01:16.267 --> 01:20.427

♪ Oh, Lord, please, don't
let me be misunderstood. ♪

01:52.507 --> 01:55.007
This is great. Thanks so much.

01:55.067 --> 01:56.827
No bother.

01:56.907 --> 02:00.074
I meant to ask you
the other day and...

02:00.627 --> 02:02.626
Does your mum see much of my dad?

02:02.627 --> 02:04.307
No.

02:04.387 --> 02:07.887
I mean, well, not at all,
as far as I know.

02:10.387 --> 02:12.787
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

02:12.867 --> 02:13.867
Yeah.

02:15.307 --> 02:17.786
Hey, do you fancy going out tonight?

02:17.787 --> 02:18.787
Yes.

02:20.267 --> 02:23.826
This photo that Emma
showed you, her parents,

02:23.827 --> 02:26.346
who weren't together at
the time, supposedly,

02:26.347 --> 02:28.546
in bed, apparently post-sex.

02:28.547 --> 02:29.667
Apparently.

02:29.747 --> 02:31.146
Well, can you imagine a situation

02:31.147 --> 02:32.746
where you've just
had sex with someone

02:32.747 --> 02:36.066
- and someone else takes a photo?
- No, but I'm square.

02:36.067 --> 02:38.586
Well, I'm not and I still can't.

02:38.587 --> 02:39.587
Self-timer.

02:41.507 --> 02:43.346
I wonder who the anthro
was on Marie Munroe,

02:43.347 --> 02:44.906
and if they were any good.

02:44.907 --> 02:47.574
I wonder if she was dismembered.

02:47.907 --> 02:49.867
Shall we carry on?

02:49.947 --> 02:51.866
I mean, it's fascinating isn't it?

02:51.867 --> 02:54.666
I'm glad Emma agreed
to speak to Neil.

02:54.667 --> 02:57.386
See, I would even question
the use of spalling.

02:57.387 --> 03:00.146
It might be clearer to say
flaking or fragmenting.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.088
Sarah, don't you think
it's fascinating?

03:02.089 --> 03:03.426
Yeah.

03:03.427 --> 03:04.427
I do.

03:07.947 --> 03:11.626
The police samples are arriving
tomorrow. The real deal.

03:11.627 --> 03:12.667
Great.

03:12.747 --> 03:15.186
Scotland has a problem.
New street drugs keep appearing,

03:15.187 --> 03:17.266
so the police don't know
what they're dealing with

03:17.267 --> 03:18.666
and drug-related deaths are up.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.306
People don't know what they're
taking, so it's really important

03:21.307 --> 03:23.986
that we research this. This study
could really make a difference.

03:23.987 --> 03:25.146
It might save lives.

03:25.147 --> 03:26.546
We'll have all the controls set up

03:26.547 --> 03:31.186
- with our samples by tomorrow morning.
- Thanks, Louise.

03:31.187 --> 03:34.306
I'll call Neil, give him your number
and ask him to ring you.

03:34.307 --> 03:35.947
OK, thanks.

03:36.027 --> 03:38.707
- You OK?
- Yeah.

03:38.787 --> 03:39.787
OK.

03:43.547 --> 03:45.706
The major investigation
team has landed.

03:45.707 --> 03:47.706
- Ah, I'm well aware.
- Are you ready?

03:47.707 --> 03:50.187
Oh, aye, ready to handover,

03:50.267 --> 03:53.986
ready to genuflect, ready to whoop
when they bugger off again,

03:53.987 --> 03:56.306
having taken the credit
for all our hard work.

03:56.307 --> 03:59.426
- Morning, ma'am, welcome.
- Absolutely. Yes. OK.

03:59.427 --> 04:01.015
- Well, yeah, well, got it.
- Ugh.

04:01.016 --> 04:02.386
Got it, got it, absolutely.

04:02.387 --> 04:04.866
So the picture we're
building up is this -

04:04.867 --> 04:08.666
Bashir Kumar and Shelley Nardoni
died accidentally.

04:08.667 --> 04:11.426
We don't yet have Professor
Torrance's report,

04:11.427 --> 04:13.186
but we've got her verbal feedback.

04:13.187 --> 04:15.986
- Neil?
- Yes, she is saying there's no evidence

04:15.987 --> 04:17.866
of blunt, sharp or ballistic trauma.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.625
- Or defence wounds.
- Uh-huh.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.106
Well, the inference is
that, in all probability,

04:22.107 --> 04:24.346
cause of death for those two
was the fire itself.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.786
We know from Professor Gordon
they were locked in the office.

04:27.787 --> 04:30.826
We've got witness statements
suggesting why they were there.

04:30.827 --> 04:32.387
Is it Trina?

04:32.467 --> 04:33.587
Yes. Trina.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.426
Shelley's best friend told us

04:35.427 --> 04:38.706
that Shelley and Bash were having
a sort of illicit work thing.

04:38.707 --> 04:40.866
Both of them were in relationships,

04:40.867 --> 04:44.426
They both smoked so they could have
been in the office for that reason.

04:44.427 --> 04:48.586
The barman told us that the two of
them had a tendency to disappear

04:48.587 --> 04:50.666
whenever they got the
opportunity for a quickie,

04:50.667 --> 04:53.026
so it maybe wasn't known that
they were in the office

04:53.027 --> 04:55.026
when the door to
the office was locked.

04:55.027 --> 04:57.266
Shelley's mum, Mrs Nardoni,
wants to know

04:57.267 --> 04:59.946
how Shelley and Bash couldn't hear
what was going on in the kitchen

04:59.947 --> 05:01.466
or being locked in.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.946
We didn't know either -
we have no witnesses -

05:03.947 --> 05:06.906
but the barman's told us
that the music is as deafening

05:06.907 --> 05:09.226
in the back as it is
in the front, so...

05:09.227 --> 05:11.426
Mrs Nardoni is very
aggrieved, by the way.

05:11.427 --> 05:16.177
The Family Liaison Team's spending
a lot of time with her.

05:16.907 --> 05:18.346
I hope that's work.

05:18.347 --> 05:19.931
No, it's my dealer.

05:20.907 --> 05:22.547
Funny.

05:22.627 --> 05:26.107
As of this morning,
we have a CCTV image

05:26.187 --> 05:28.306
of what appears to be Shuggie Brook

05:28.307 --> 05:32.586
letting a man into the kitchen
fire door at ten to ten,

05:32.587 --> 05:36.627
and we have an ID on
the body in the kitchen -

05:36.707 --> 05:37.947
Ian Howie.

05:39.867 --> 05:43.626
The pathologist reported
that Ian Howie was dead

05:43.627 --> 05:47.387
before the fire started. No soot
inhalation.

05:47.467 --> 05:50.706
The floor beneath him was pristine,
not fire-blackened.

05:50.707 --> 05:53.867
The cause of death
was strangulation.

05:53.947 --> 05:56.866
Well, we actually got hold
of the clothes that the manager,

05:56.867 --> 06:00.266
Shuggie Brook, was wearing on the
night of the fire, including a belt.

06:00.267 --> 06:02.641
We're running a DNA check
on that, Alec?

06:02.642 --> 06:03.306
Yes.

06:03.307 --> 06:04.724
Fast-tracking it.

06:05.467 --> 06:09.217
Great. So we're making some
real progress now.

06:09.627 --> 06:10.786
I got your message.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.266
Course I'll speak to Emma Hedges.

06:12.267 --> 06:13.966
Tell her I'll ring
her tomorrow morning.

06:13.967 --> 06:15.026
Will do.

06:15.027 --> 06:18.626
- I can do you that favour after all.
- How come?

06:18.627 --> 06:21.266
I'll need to access
the Marie Monroe files.

06:21.267 --> 06:23.786
I have bona fide policing
purpose to do so

06:23.787 --> 06:25.426
cos I'm speaking to her daughter.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.547
Right.

06:26.627 --> 06:31.187
So, if you e-mail me a summary
of your MOOC modules,

06:31.267 --> 06:33.266
I can suggest what
changes you should make

06:33.267 --> 06:35.346
to avoid further accidental overlaps

06:35.347 --> 06:38.586
without sharing confidential
information.

06:38.587 --> 06:40.067
Neil.

06:40.147 --> 06:41.731
You know something?

06:42.267 --> 06:43.347
What?

06:43.427 --> 06:44.677
You're my hero.

06:46.027 --> 06:50.227
Fever>>
by Endor ft. FERAL Is Kinky

07:26.307 --> 07:27.307
Emma.

07:31.187 --> 07:32.906
You've got to wake up.

07:32.907 --> 07:34.074
I've got work.

07:37.507 --> 07:38.507
So have I.

07:53.187 --> 07:54.354
Did we, um...?

07:55.227 --> 07:56.227
Yes.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.417
Have you seen my bag?

08:06.419 --> 08:08.790
I don't remember
you having a bag.

08:08.791 --> 08:09.791
Shit.

08:21.427 --> 08:22.427
Hello?

08:22.507 --> 08:24.226
I left my bag in there last night.

08:24.227 --> 08:25.986
Can you let me come in
and have a look?

08:25.987 --> 08:28.946
Can't do that, sorry. You'll
need to come back when we're open.

08:28.947 --> 08:31.447
- I need my phone.
- I said no.

08:35.827 --> 08:37.946
Can you help me?

08:37.947 --> 08:41.946
I think I left my bag in there
last night and he won't let me in.

08:41.947 --> 08:44.946
I need my phone. I'm waiting
on a really important call,

08:44.947 --> 08:46.906
and I need to get to work.

08:46.907 --> 08:48.547
Hello?

08:48.627 --> 08:51.226
Hi, Paul. It's Daniel
from MacAfee Construction.

08:51.227 --> 08:53.347
Hi, Daniel. Come on in.

08:53.427 --> 08:54.427
Please.

09:01.947 --> 09:03.586
I need a description of your bag.

09:03.587 --> 09:06.667
Um, it's green, small.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.581
It's got a long strap.

09:09.547 --> 09:10.787
Its contents?

09:10.867 --> 09:15.107
Uh... phone in a red case.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.947
Keys, purse.

09:18.027 --> 09:19.027
I love you.

09:22.107 --> 09:23.706
- Thanks again.
- Ah, no bother.

09:23.707 --> 09:25.266
I needed to do a good deed today.

09:25.267 --> 09:28.106
Well, now you have.
I'm late for work.

09:28.107 --> 09:31.027
- Do I know you?
- No.

09:31.107 --> 09:34.187
Well, listen, ring me if you ever...

09:34.267 --> 09:35.667
What?

09:35.747 --> 09:37.467
...want to ring me.

09:37.547 --> 09:39.106
You know what would be great?

09:39.107 --> 09:41.066
If men could have
an interaction with a woman

09:41.067 --> 09:43.426
- that didn't end up chasing sex.
- I'm not.

09:43.427 --> 09:46.226
What, you think I might
need some construction?

09:46.227 --> 09:47.626
I tell you what would be great.

09:47.627 --> 09:49.506
If women could have
an interaction with a man

09:49.507 --> 09:50.946
without expecting him to be a dick.

09:50.947 --> 09:53.346
In fact, wanting him to be a dick
so they can rip his head off.

09:53.347 --> 09:55.866
OK, then, why do you want me
to ring you? What would be the goal?

09:55.867 --> 09:58.261
Forget it. I don't want you to ring me.
I mean, you're awful.

09:58.262 --> 10:00.266
- Please, don't ring me.
- No, you gave it me.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.346
Can't have it back just
because I'm not being cute.

10:02.347 --> 10:04.106
How've you even got time
to be so arsey?!

10:04.107 --> 10:05.907
You're late for work!

10:05.987 --> 10:06.987
Dick.

10:39.827 --> 10:42.744
- Hiya.
- Are you OK? Lost my phone.

10:43.467 --> 10:45.027
Found my phone.

10:45.107 --> 10:48.026
Shagged that bloke.
Remembered nothing.

10:48.027 --> 10:51.546
I'd have never let you go with him,
but you were adamant. Sorry.

10:51.547 --> 10:52.707
I did it.

10:52.787 --> 10:55.826
Well, I made it home,
but I fell asleep on the toilet.

10:55.827 --> 10:58.577
- What?
- I feel like burst couch.

10:59.227 --> 11:02.066
Will you shout me
when my phone wakes up?

11:02.067 --> 11:04.347
- I need a shower.
- Sure.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.906
Listen, I know my mum
freaked you out

11:07.907 --> 11:11.026
- when she said your mum's body was...
- It's OK.

11:11.027 --> 11:13.066
I think it's the medication
she's on.

11:13.067 --> 11:16.186
She's seen an angel,
she's been to France.

11:16.187 --> 11:18.986
- Do you want breakfast?
- I haven't got time.

11:18.987 --> 11:20.627
I'm in at 11.

11:20.707 --> 11:22.666
I'll make you a piece.
What do want in it?

11:22.667 --> 11:24.587
Anything. Thank you.

11:28.227 --> 11:32.706
Take the proxy bones kindly provided
by members of the pig community.

11:32.707 --> 11:36.467
Cut them - partial cuts, full cuts.

11:36.547 --> 11:38.106
Use different tools.

11:38.107 --> 11:39.826
How does the bone behave?

11:39.827 --> 11:41.306
Look at the marks -

11:41.307 --> 11:43.546
photograph them, magnify them.

11:43.547 --> 11:49.047
Write down what you find on your
log sheets. You've got 20 minutes.

11:49.907 --> 11:52.907
Emma, are you all right
with peanuts?

12:04.107 --> 12:05.107
Emma?

12:20.133 --> 12:21.934
What does it mean?

12:22.036 --> 12:23.476
Um...

12:23.556 --> 12:27.556
That my mum and dad
had sex in your mum's bed,

12:27.636 --> 12:30.220
and then your mum took a photo.

12:30.716 --> 12:32.356
I'll ask her.

12:32.436 --> 12:34.595
I'm going to the hospital
after work.

12:34.596 --> 12:38.096
- I'll ask her.
- OK, cool. I've got to go.

12:41.156 --> 12:42.636
Hello?

12:42.716 --> 12:44.435
Am I speaking to Emma Hedges?

12:44.436 --> 12:45.285
Yes.

12:45.287 --> 12:47.835
Hello, Emma. This is Detective
Inspector Neil McKinven.

12:47.836 --> 12:49.156
Oh, hello.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.515
Sarah Gordon suggested
I give you a ring.

12:51.516 --> 12:54.715
She said you might be interested
in having a chat about your mother.

12:54.716 --> 12:58.115
I just wanted to make contact
and check that's what you want.

12:58.116 --> 13:00.516
- Yeah.
- Right, well,

13:00.596 --> 13:04.155
I'll come to SIFA between
11 and 12 if that suits?

13:04.156 --> 13:06.276
OK. See you then.

13:06.356 --> 13:07.796
Thanks, bye.

13:07.876 --> 13:08.960
Who was that?

13:10.236 --> 13:12.156
A police guy.

13:12.236 --> 13:13.556
Police?

13:13.636 --> 13:17.835
Yeah, I've... I've been put
in touch with this police guy

13:17.836 --> 13:20.836
who I don't know exactly,

13:20.916 --> 13:26.196
but... he's going to meet me
and have a chat about my mum.

13:26.276 --> 13:27.276
Well.

13:28.556 --> 13:30.475
The cut mark was made by a saw.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.155
- Because?
- Because the curve flow is square.

13:33.156 --> 13:37.716
- Because?
- Because the teeth of a saw are offset.

13:37.796 --> 13:39.796
That's right.

13:39.876 --> 13:44.315
And it's a partial cut so we can see
the W showing that offset.

13:44.316 --> 13:46.150
What else can you see?

13:46.196 --> 13:48.275
Hesitation marks, false starts.

13:48.276 --> 13:49.860
- How many?
- Three.

13:50.876 --> 13:56.626
What do the marks tell us about the
person who cut through human bone?

13:56.636 --> 13:57.956
Nothing.

13:58.036 --> 13:59.036
Nothing?

14:00.596 --> 14:01.596
Thank you.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.635
They don't tell us
the person was nervous

14:04.636 --> 14:08.136
or left-handed or right-handed
or a Gemini.

14:08.156 --> 14:10.955
The marks only tell us
that the blade of the saw

14:10.956 --> 14:14.195
made contact with the bone three
times before biting in.

14:14.196 --> 14:15.956
This is so important.

14:16.036 --> 14:20.035
We're dealing in facts, and the
facts have to be clear and correct.

14:20.036 --> 14:21.955
That information could
be used in court.

14:21.956 --> 14:25.873
Somebody could lose their liberty
because of it.

14:34.556 --> 14:37.355
- Did you work on my mum's case?
- Mm-hm.

14:37.356 --> 14:39.955
I took statements right at the start

14:39.956 --> 14:42.155
when it was still at
the missing person stage.

14:42.156 --> 14:45.755
I followed the case, of course,
but I wasn't CID then.

14:45.756 --> 14:48.796
I'm an Operational DI for Dundee.

14:48.876 --> 14:51.355
What they call boots on the ground.

14:51.356 --> 14:52.596
Right.

14:52.676 --> 14:55.395
I've accessed the files
on our system

14:55.396 --> 14:58.195
and had a look in preparation
for speaking to you.

14:58.196 --> 14:59.196
Right.

15:00.716 --> 15:03.555
Shall I say a bit about
what I'm bringing to this,

15:03.556 --> 15:06.115
and then you can tell me
what you'd like from it?

15:06.116 --> 15:07.116
Yeah.

15:08.196 --> 15:10.675
I have a duty of care to meet you.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.916
I don't want to meet you.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.716
I want you to be OK,

15:14.796 --> 15:18.955
and I'm obliged if I think someone
has further evidence of crime

15:18.956 --> 15:21.795
- to pursue it.
- I'm not bringing evidence of crime.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.955
I've just got things that, you know,

15:23.956 --> 15:27.123
I'm thinking about
and wondering about.

15:27.836 --> 15:31.420
I'm not even sure I want
to talk about them.

15:33.436 --> 15:39.020
Would you be willing... to talk about
the day your mum went missing?

15:40.676 --> 15:42.316
Um...

15:42.396 --> 15:45.195
We were at the Tall Ships Festival.

15:45.196 --> 15:48.756
Me, my mum, my little brother,

15:48.836 --> 15:50.670
my half-brother, um...

15:51.996 --> 15:53.746
...my stepdad, Jimmy.

15:55.836 --> 15:57.003
It was packed.

15:58.396 --> 16:02.596
It was Sunday and... there
were hundreds of ships,

16:02.676 --> 16:05.796
like, ships out of books with sails.

16:05.876 --> 16:07.556
- Schooners.
- Yeah.

16:09.796 --> 16:13.075
And there was music
and stalls and hot dogs,

16:13.076 --> 16:15.743
and everyone was having a party.

16:17.796 --> 16:22.195
And we met up with my mum's friend,
Izzy, and her daughter Skye.

16:22.196 --> 16:23.955
She was my best friend at school.

16:23.956 --> 16:26.206
- How old were you?
- Seven.

16:28.676 --> 16:30.843
It was getting late and...

16:31.236 --> 16:34.195
...my little brother needed
putting to bed,

16:34.196 --> 16:38.530
so we went home with my stepdad
and my mum stayed on.

16:38.836 --> 16:41.586
That was the last time I saw her.

16:42.596 --> 16:44.930
By the water with the ships.

16:51.556 --> 16:54.875
I didn't find out what
happened till later.

16:54.876 --> 16:57.043
And what did you find out?

16:59.516 --> 17:03.955
First, I was told that she'd gone
away but she'd be back.

17:03.956 --> 17:07.954
Then I was told that she was ill
in hospital and she'd get better,

17:07.955 --> 17:11.373
but I couldn't visit
because of the germs.

17:13.915 --> 17:16.035
Then, when they found her body
three months later,

17:16.036 --> 17:18.786
they had to tell me she was dead.

17:19.796 --> 17:21.116
That's awful.

17:22.796 --> 17:27.635
And when I was old enough, they told
me that someone had killed her.

17:27.636 --> 17:31.386
And that they never found
out who or why or...

17:31.836 --> 17:34.755
And that she was buried on Law Hill.

17:34.756 --> 17:36.590
Found by a dog walker.

17:41.596 --> 17:46.875
Someone just told me that, when they
found my mum's body, it was cut up.

17:46.876 --> 17:48.476
Right.

17:48.556 --> 17:49.556
OK.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.395
And my aunt, she... she adopted me
after my mum died,

17:53.396 --> 17:55.675
and she was really protective.

17:55.676 --> 17:57.926
My stepdad was, too, and...

17:57.996 --> 18:00.395
Anyway, they both say that they were
never told anything

18:00.396 --> 18:02.155
about my mum's body
being dismembered

18:02.156 --> 18:05.906
and that the person
who told me is unreliable.

18:06.436 --> 18:08.036
Why?

18:08.116 --> 18:12.033
Well, my stepdad thinks
that she's been a bit...

18:12.636 --> 18:13.796
...druggie.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.680
Is it true...

18:18.636 --> 18:20.553
...that she was cut up?

18:22.316 --> 18:24.075
I can't pass on any information

18:24.076 --> 18:27.493
that could compromise
any ongoing enquiry.

18:29.116 --> 18:32.195
You were seven when your mum
was murdered, God love you.

18:32.196 --> 18:34.475
Well, chances are you didn't do it,

18:34.476 --> 18:37.355
but you could know the person
that did do it.

18:37.356 --> 18:42.606
You might not even know that
you know the person that did do it.

18:42.956 --> 18:46.475
You know you were talking
about relationships and...

18:46.476 --> 18:49.436
I'm not saying this is...

18:49.516 --> 18:53.196
Not accusing or suspecting
anyone of...

18:57.436 --> 19:01.103
This is just something
that I found recently.

19:04.116 --> 19:07.315
Mum cut her hair short when
I was about six,

19:07.316 --> 19:09.915
so at the time that photo was taken,

19:09.916 --> 19:14.666
Mum and Jimmy must have been married
at least three years.

19:14.836 --> 19:16.956
But that's not Jimmy.

19:17.036 --> 19:18.836
This is my dad, Drew.

19:19.996 --> 19:22.156
Ah, I see.

19:22.236 --> 19:25.153
- Have you asked him about it?
- No.

19:25.436 --> 19:28.186
I'm not accusing him of anything.

19:29.396 --> 19:31.896
Have you shown this to anyone?

19:32.796 --> 19:34.115
Professor Gordon.

19:34.116 --> 19:35.116
Anyone else?

19:36.916 --> 19:38.250
A friend saw it.

19:39.436 --> 19:42.103
Did they know anything about it?

19:45.756 --> 19:48.556
Did the friend you showed it to

19:48.636 --> 19:51.915
know you at the time of
your mother's murder?

19:51.916 --> 19:53.556
Yeah.

19:53.636 --> 19:56.315
I think you need to stop sleuthing.

19:56.316 --> 19:58.355
You don't know what
you're getting into.

19:58.356 --> 20:02.915
You're possibly poking around into
something someone's wanting to hide.

20:02.916 --> 20:04.915
What, so you mean trust no-one?

20:04.916 --> 20:06.556
No, not no-one.

20:06.636 --> 20:08.995
Just everyone that
I've known up until now.

20:08.996 --> 20:13.036
Just be very careful
about what you say,

20:13.116 --> 20:14.700
to whom you say it.

20:16.196 --> 20:18.030
I want you to be safe.

20:20.196 --> 20:22.635
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me?

20:22.636 --> 20:23.636
No.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.726
Would you be happy
to e-mail that to me?

20:32.516 --> 20:33.516
OK.

20:39.676 --> 20:41.356
Emma.

20:41.436 --> 20:43.156
How did you get on?

20:43.236 --> 20:44.516
Fine.

20:44.596 --> 20:47.035
- Did Neil look after you?
- Yeah.

20:47.036 --> 20:49.635
He says he's going to speak
to the review team.

20:49.636 --> 20:50.876
Good.

20:50.956 --> 20:53.435
The police drug samples
are arriving any minute.

20:53.436 --> 20:56.270
I'll show you how to sign them in.

21:05.716 --> 21:08.156
We have a match.

21:08.236 --> 21:11.435
Ian Howie's DNA on
Shuggie Brook's belt,

21:11.436 --> 21:14.195
and that's consistent with it
being used as a ligature.

21:14.196 --> 21:15.435
Great stuff, Alec.

21:15.436 --> 21:20.476
So the picture we've now got
is Brook strangled Howie

21:20.556 --> 21:24.955
in the kitchen and tried to cover up
the murder by starting a fire,

21:24.956 --> 21:27.596
so it's looking premeditated.

21:27.676 --> 21:29.995
- Trina?
- Shuggie Brook was in debt.

21:29.996 --> 21:31.475
He's got loans on the go.

21:31.476 --> 21:34.715
You can see from his statements
he's withdrawing large amounts.

21:34.716 --> 21:37.915
It seems Ian Howie was
a cash man and a gambler.

21:37.916 --> 21:41.155
It was normal for him to go off
for days at a time.

21:41.156 --> 21:45.555
Oh, and Secrets was insured
for fire, recently renewed.

21:45.556 --> 21:47.435
Brook would have known,
if he got that pay out,

21:47.436 --> 21:48.875
he could to anything with it.

21:48.876 --> 21:51.875
He didn't have to use it to rebuild.

21:51.876 --> 21:53.875
It doesn't explain why
he killed Howie.

21:53.876 --> 21:56.235
No mystery why Brook
jumped off the bridge.

21:56.236 --> 21:58.675
He accidentally killed Bashir Kumar
and his own niece

21:58.676 --> 21:59.875
when he rigged the toaster.

21:59.876 --> 22:03.156
OK, so possibly a financial motive.

22:03.236 --> 22:05.915
Can we find out
if there's another story?

22:05.916 --> 22:08.955
What are our confidential
sources telling us?

22:08.956 --> 22:11.715
We need to make sure that
we speak to witnesses

22:11.716 --> 22:13.275
as if Brook hadn't died.

22:13.276 --> 22:16.915
We need to cover all aspects
of these people's deaths.

22:16.916 --> 22:20.475
Sarah Gordon at SIFA flagged up
issues with the building itself.

22:20.476 --> 22:24.155
We're speaking to the people
who refurbished it in 2008?

22:24.156 --> 22:25.555
MacAfee Construction.

22:25.556 --> 22:28.995
Getting any evidence that they've
got of materials used,

22:28.996 --> 22:31.676
any receipts, invoices, today?

22:31.756 --> 22:33.275
- Straight after this.
- Great.

22:33.276 --> 22:36.675
So it's looking like
two discrete elements -

22:36.676 --> 22:39.795
one intentional murder
and two accidental,

22:39.796 --> 22:43.715
but we need to make sure that
we're not missing a connection.

22:43.716 --> 22:47.475
There is likely to be
a fatal accident enquiry.

22:47.476 --> 22:50.156
The families will want answers.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.276
Three, one, five,

22:52.356 --> 22:55.556
- seven, four.
- Thanks.

22:55.636 --> 22:59.115
Your uniform's spotless as well, and
these goggles don't miss anything.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.755
We were expecting you first thing.

23:00.756 --> 23:03.116
Sorry about that.

23:03.196 --> 23:04.916
Emma, look.

23:04.996 --> 23:09.395
I asked for a subsection from each
drug seizure that the police make

23:09.396 --> 23:12.195
so we get a mix like this.
That's how you check everything off.

23:12.196 --> 23:17.155
- I need to get to my first years.
- Leave it with me. Thanks.

23:17.156 --> 23:18.355
Were you after some cake?

23:18.356 --> 23:21.835
No. Well... One of the lads
was telling me...

23:21.836 --> 23:24.635
We have the remains of a banana
loaf or a red velvet.

23:24.636 --> 23:26.636
Ooh, red velvet, please.

23:35.516 --> 23:37.275
Bobby's in for a shock.

23:37.276 --> 23:38.636
That's right.

23:38.716 --> 23:41.435
Hey, Bobby, fasten your seat belt

23:41.436 --> 23:44.595
cos you're about to start
being fed some real drugs

23:44.596 --> 23:47.263
from the mean streets of Dundee.

23:47.636 --> 23:49.436
Right.

23:49.516 --> 23:51.075
Let's start with these.

23:51.076 --> 23:53.826
We can lock the rest in the safe.

24:19.996 --> 24:23.435
Are you at all familiar
with these little blue pills?

24:23.436 --> 24:24.476
Hm, well...

24:25.916 --> 24:27.355
They have a generic appearance,

24:27.356 --> 24:31.835
so I can't be sure if we've analysed
these specific ones previously.

24:31.836 --> 24:33.396
Right.

24:33.476 --> 24:34.476
Sure, yeah.

24:37.996 --> 24:39.476
Hi, Skye.

24:39.556 --> 24:42.195
I was just wondering if you asked
your mum about the photo.

24:42.196 --> 24:44.916
No, see, I went to visit,

24:44.996 --> 24:47.035
but seemingly she'd had a bad day

24:47.036 --> 24:49.755
so they said to leave her sleeping,
and I never saw her.

24:49.756 --> 24:50.836
Oh, OK.

24:50.916 --> 24:52.195
And you never sent me it.

24:52.196 --> 24:54.155
You were going to send me the photo.

24:54.156 --> 24:56.156
Yeah, yeah.

24:56.236 --> 24:58.435
I don't think we should bother
her with it, actually.

24:58.436 --> 25:00.475
I was wondering the same, you know.

25:00.476 --> 25:03.915
She's in a bad way, and I think
it's inappropriate to bother her.

25:03.916 --> 25:04.916
I agree.

25:06.316 --> 25:08.036
Just leave her be.

25:08.116 --> 25:09.955
It was a private thing
between my mum and dad,

25:09.956 --> 25:11.675
whatever they got up to.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.926
Yeah, I think you're right.

25:15.076 --> 25:18.555
Oh, erm, how did you get on
with your police guy?

25:18.556 --> 25:21.515
Oh, it was literally like,
"Hello. Nice to meet you.

25:21.516 --> 25:24.515
"Sorry about your mum. We can't
tell you anything. Bye-bye."

25:24.516 --> 25:25.915
It was a waste of time.

25:25.916 --> 25:26.916
Oh, well.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.878
Listen, I've got to go.
I'm meeting someone.

25:30.879 --> 25:31.879
Who?

25:32.076 --> 25:33.555
Like a date someone?

25:33.556 --> 25:37.140
- I'll tell you later. Bye.
- Bye, gorgeous.

25:40.716 --> 25:41.716
Hi.

25:43.488 --> 25:46.220
- You didn't really, did you?
- No, I did.

25:46.221 --> 25:49.900
I did chuck it in the bin,
and then I took it out again.

25:49.901 --> 25:50.981
Why?

25:51.061 --> 25:53.621
You were kind, I was rude,

25:53.701 --> 25:57.021
and I like your nose
for some reason.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.503
It's my dad's nose.

25:58.504 --> 26:00.339
I hope he's got his own,
though, right?

26:00.340 --> 26:03.020
Oh, aye. He's fully equipped
in the nose department.

26:03.021 --> 26:06.860
A pint of heavy and a pint
of lime and soda, please.

26:06.861 --> 26:09.501
Are you sure - lime and soda?

26:09.581 --> 26:10.941
Yeah.

26:11.021 --> 26:13.860
- Quite a night last night, was it?
- Not really.

26:13.861 --> 26:15.940
You strike me as quite
the party animal.

26:15.941 --> 26:18.621
- Not really.
- No?

26:18.701 --> 26:20.820
Leaving your most precious
possessions in a club

26:20.821 --> 26:22.380
usually indicates a good night.

26:22.381 --> 26:23.548
Or a lost one.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.335
I wondered about that.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.421
Are you OK?

26:31.901 --> 26:32.985
I don't know.

26:37.421 --> 26:40.781
Week one was a huge success.

26:40.861 --> 26:44.541
23,119 people completed the MOOC.

26:44.621 --> 26:46.660
Great feedback and they're
clamouring for more,

26:46.661 --> 26:48.741
so well done, everybody.

26:48.821 --> 26:51.980
And I know it's late, but there's
some tiny wee amendments

26:51.981 --> 26:55.780
we need to make to the content of
modules five and six, so listen up.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.780
When we get to family background,

26:57.781 --> 27:01.100
can we make it our victim
had three sons,

27:01.101 --> 27:04.420
and can we change the age of
the victim's husband to 29?

27:04.421 --> 27:07.060
That's it. These are
the sections it affects.

27:07.061 --> 27:09.420
When you've made those changes,
just ping them over to me.

27:09.421 --> 27:13.838
Do you mind me asking the reason
behind those changes?

27:14.421 --> 27:16.940
We sailed too close to reality.

27:16.941 --> 27:18.691
That's all I can say.

27:20.501 --> 27:23.585
So why did you need
to do a good deed?

27:24.021 --> 27:25.820
To make up for a bad one, of course.

27:25.821 --> 27:27.155
What did you do?

27:28.381 --> 27:30.501
It's what I didn't do.

27:30.581 --> 27:32.165
What didn't you do?

27:33.581 --> 27:34.831
I didn't think.

27:36.021 --> 27:38.141
I was stupid,

27:38.221 --> 27:40.020
and people suffered as a result.

27:40.021 --> 27:43.101
Are you talking about work or...?

27:43.181 --> 27:44.701
Work.

27:44.781 --> 27:46.020
And when you say suffered...?

27:46.021 --> 27:48.060
Well, they didn't suffer
as a direct result of me,

27:48.061 --> 27:50.021
but... I played a part.

27:56.141 --> 27:57.808
So what will happen?

27:58.301 --> 28:01.940
Well, the police just spoke to me,
looking into what we did.

28:01.941 --> 28:04.420
- What your company did?
- Yeah.

28:04.421 --> 28:08.005
They want paperwork
I don't have any more...

28:08.501 --> 28:10.540
...to see if we're culpable

28:10.541 --> 28:14.540
of doing things that maybe made
a fire turn into a really bad fire.

28:14.541 --> 28:16.708
Just have to wait and see.

28:17.301 --> 28:19.660
- But you didn't intend to...
- No, no.

28:19.661 --> 28:20.741
No. God, no.

28:24.141 --> 28:28.391
I still want to bury myself
in the ground, you know?

28:32.221 --> 28:34.055
Will we go for a walk?

28:35.141 --> 28:38.975
MOOC, module two, insert
number four. Take one.

28:39.981 --> 28:42.141
Sorry. Do it again.

28:43.261 --> 28:44.821
What is this for?

28:44.901 --> 28:46.860
To go between your talky bits.

28:46.861 --> 28:48.140
I feel like a tube.

28:48.141 --> 28:50.061
It looks good. Go.

28:51.301 --> 28:53.141
Don't upskirt me.

28:53.221 --> 28:55.221
What do you take me for?

28:55.861 --> 28:56.861
Right.

29:01.101 --> 29:02.941
Excuse me.

29:03.021 --> 29:05.100
Does Professor Torrance work here?

29:05.101 --> 29:06.981
She does.

29:07.061 --> 29:09.140
Is there somewhere
I can leave her a message?

29:09.141 --> 29:11.261
She's here. Come in.

29:11.341 --> 29:14.460
Oh. I don't want to disturb
her at work.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.795
Well, will I go and get her?

29:17.661 --> 29:18.661
OK.

29:20.101 --> 29:22.101
- Who shall I say?
- Pia.

29:30.021 --> 29:32.981
OK, so I am a bit of
a party animal.

29:33.061 --> 29:36.061
I mean, I used to be
big time, and...

29:36.941 --> 29:38.740
...I'm trying not to be now.

29:38.741 --> 29:41.580
- When did you used to be?
- When I was a student.

29:41.581 --> 29:45.820
I overdid it, got in a bit of a mess
and took a year out.

29:45.821 --> 29:47.380
What sort of a mess?

29:47.381 --> 29:49.298
Anxiety and depression.

29:51.061 --> 29:52.061
Right.

29:53.421 --> 29:55.141
Did you get help?

29:55.221 --> 29:57.461
Yeah, I did.

29:57.541 --> 30:01.100
Got put on antidepressants,
saw a counsellor.

30:01.101 --> 30:05.060
She helped me start to get to
the bottom of things.

30:05.061 --> 30:07.820
I don't think I've ever got
to the bottom of anything.

30:07.821 --> 30:10.420
I've got a pretty good idea
what was going on.

30:10.421 --> 30:12.340
Things were catching up with me.

30:12.341 --> 30:13.541
What things?

30:14.861 --> 30:16.445
Just family things.

30:17.261 --> 30:20.500
She helped me sort of
wise up to myself.

30:20.501 --> 30:21.940
- The counsellor?
- Yeah.

30:21.941 --> 30:24.660
So it's not like I'm cured of
my bad patterns or whatever,

30:24.661 --> 30:26.701
but now I'm onto them.

30:26.781 --> 30:29.340
Tell me your bad patterns,
I'll tell you mine.

30:29.341 --> 30:30.341
OK.

30:31.661 --> 30:33.541
I put myself at risk.

30:33.621 --> 30:35.500
You know, in the books it would say,

30:35.501 --> 30:39.301
"Engages in impulsive
and risky behaviour."

30:39.381 --> 30:41.061
You?

30:41.141 --> 30:42.860
I don't know what it would
say in the books,

30:42.861 --> 30:44.620
but I know what my ex would say.

30:44.621 --> 30:46.620
She would say my bad
patterns are that

30:46.621 --> 30:49.220
I don't say what I'm thinking,
that I want people to like me

30:49.221 --> 30:51.900
and I don't want to piss them off,
so I don't tell them things.

30:51.901 --> 30:53.900
I just keep trying to be
who I think they like

30:53.901 --> 30:56.180
till I can't do that
any more and I run away,

30:56.181 --> 30:58.340
at which point I've pissed
them off spectacularly.

30:58.341 --> 31:00.580
You've told me lots of things.

31:00.581 --> 31:02.180
Cos I don't know you.

31:02.181 --> 31:03.500
It's great, isn't it?

31:03.501 --> 31:06.740
Don't know why anyone bothers
talking to people they know.

31:06.741 --> 31:08.660
Where are we going, by the way?

31:08.661 --> 31:09.661
Law Hill.

31:22.301 --> 31:25.820
Well, this is a little
attention seeking, isn't it?

31:25.821 --> 31:28.740
I wanted to leave a note. I thought
no-one would be here so late.

31:28.741 --> 31:32.620
Everyone is here. Everyone
is wondering who Pia is.

31:32.621 --> 31:34.101
I'm sorry.

31:34.181 --> 31:36.340
I'm a very private person, OK?

31:36.341 --> 31:37.820
It's one thing for me
to meet someone

31:37.821 --> 31:39.420
and spend time with them
when I'm away,

31:39.421 --> 31:41.260
but I don't bring my private
life to work, OK?

31:41.261 --> 31:43.928
And I don't like being ambushed.

31:45.701 --> 31:47.660
Did you get my postcard?

31:47.661 --> 31:48.661
Yes.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.500
If you'd given me your number,
there would be no ambush.

31:52.501 --> 31:54.300
But I didn't. There's your clue.

31:54.301 --> 31:56.660
Aren't you pleased to see me?

31:56.661 --> 31:57.661
No.

31:58.861 --> 32:00.541
OK.

32:00.621 --> 32:02.221
That's clear.

32:02.301 --> 32:04.621
Don't worry, it's cool.

32:04.701 --> 32:07.861
I got the rest of Scotland
to explore.

32:07.941 --> 32:08.941
It's cool.

32:13.301 --> 32:14.385
I'll see you.

32:39.941 --> 32:41.621
I like the bigness.

32:41.701 --> 32:42.701
Yeah.

32:45.021 --> 32:47.021
You been up here before?

32:48.301 --> 32:49.718
When I was a kid.

32:51.181 --> 32:52.848
Before I moved away.

32:54.901 --> 32:57.818
I've not been up here for 18 years.

32:58.901 --> 32:59.985
Very precise.

33:19.301 --> 33:21.101
Cold?

33:21.181 --> 33:22.501
I'm all right.

33:22.581 --> 33:24.581
You're freezing.

33:24.661 --> 33:26.581
Come in.

33:26.661 --> 33:27.661
Come on.

33:33.421 --> 33:34.701
Better?

33:34.781 --> 33:35.781
Yeah.

33:38.941 --> 33:41.275
We're standing on a volcano.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.471
- Easy, tiger.
- No, we are!

33:44.501 --> 33:47.660
- This is an extinct volcano.
- No way. Way.

33:47.661 --> 33:50.221
That's why it's cone-shaped.

33:50.300 --> 33:53.242
- What do you think I meant?
- You know what.

33:53.243 --> 33:56.220
Oh, do you think
I was getting romantical, eh?

33:56.221 --> 33:57.305
Give me that.

34:04.301 --> 34:09.801
When I drove over that bridge,
I had to wait for a guy to jump off.

34:10.061 --> 34:11.900
When was that?

34:11.981 --> 34:12.981
Monday.

34:15.141 --> 34:16.821
I knew that guy.

34:16.900 --> 34:17.900
How come?

34:19.061 --> 34:20.728
He started the fire.

34:40.797 --> 34:43.438
They've been as good as gold.

34:43.518 --> 34:45.838
Your mammy's here!

34:45.918 --> 34:47.998
Monkey! Monkey, monkey.

34:48.078 --> 34:49.358
Oh, my monkey.

34:49.438 --> 34:52.638
So nice to see you, yes, so...

34:52.717 --> 34:54.237
Hi, good evening.

34:54.318 --> 34:56.516
I'd like to speak with a guest
who's staying with you,

34:56.518 --> 34:57.997
but I don't know her room number.

34:57.998 --> 34:59.357
OK, do you have her name?

34:59.358 --> 35:02.628
Yes, it's Salvador. Pia Salvador.
S for sugar...

35:02.629 --> 35:05.077
Unfortunately, we can't hand
that information out.

35:05.078 --> 35:06.245
OK, thank you.

35:22.518 --> 35:23.637
I know, don't judge.

35:23.638 --> 35:25.757
Oh, hi. Hello.

35:25.758 --> 35:31.157
Yes, I'd like to speak with someone
who's staying with you, please.

35:31.158 --> 35:34.597
Listen, Sarah. Will you keep
an eye on Emma Hedges?

35:34.598 --> 35:35.958
Why?

35:36.038 --> 35:37.637
I think we need to look out for her.

35:37.638 --> 35:40.237
Well, I don't know how I'm expected
to look out for her

35:40.238 --> 35:43.037
if I don't know what
I'm looking out for.

35:43.038 --> 35:46.037
She knows something
that was never disclosed

35:46.038 --> 35:47.557
because it was specialist.

35:47.558 --> 35:51.197
The only people that would know
would be a handful of officers

35:51.198 --> 35:53.997
and the murderer,
someone who assisted them

35:53.998 --> 35:57.877
- or someone they told.
- Are we talking about dismemberment?

35:57.878 --> 36:00.197
Emma's recently tried out
this specialist information

36:00.198 --> 36:03.557
on several people, so
it's known that she knows.

36:03.558 --> 36:05.808
Which makes her vulnerable.

36:07.358 --> 36:10.918
Sorry. Bit of a mess.

36:10.998 --> 36:12.558
No.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.477
It's a really nice place.

36:14.478 --> 36:15.895
My dad helped me.

36:16.558 --> 36:17.558
Lucky you.

36:19.598 --> 36:21.682
Yeah, he helped me a lot.

36:21.758 --> 36:23.117
He's great, my dad.

36:23.118 --> 36:25.535
- Are you close?
- We are. Oh.

36:26.478 --> 36:30.562
- Would you like a drink?
- No, I'm fine just now.

36:31.678 --> 36:34.437
I still can't believe you knew
the guy that jumped off the bridge.

36:34.438 --> 36:36.938
I didn't know him as a friend.

36:39.918 --> 36:42.335
- Are you warm enough?
- Yeah.

36:44.438 --> 36:48.188
- Have you got any coffee?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

36:50.118 --> 36:52.397
- How flash is that?
- Och, I know.

36:52.398 --> 36:54.797
Peels potatoes and
posts your letters as well.

36:54.798 --> 36:57.277
- Must have cost a fortune.
- It was a present.

36:57.278 --> 36:58.445
From your dad?

36:59.518 --> 37:01.518
- My mum.
- Nice.

37:03.438 --> 37:04.438
Yeah.

37:06.518 --> 37:08.637
You close to your mum and dad?

37:08.638 --> 37:10.972
My mum died a long time ago.

37:11.598 --> 37:13.515
Don't worry, it's fine.

37:13.958 --> 37:16.398
And I love my dad

37:16.478 --> 37:18.645
when I can track him down,

37:18.678 --> 37:21.345
but I'm really close to my aunt.

37:21.398 --> 37:24.482
Is that what was catching
up with you?

37:25.478 --> 37:26.757
When you took a year out of uni,

37:26.758 --> 37:29.637
you said things were
catching up with you.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.917
Did you mean losing your mum?

37:31.918 --> 37:32.918
Yeah.

37:48.158 --> 37:49.158
What?

37:52.958 --> 37:54.875
I've ran out of coffee.

38:01.518 --> 38:04.798
I'm all over the place
about this fire.

38:04.878 --> 38:06.398
Sorry.

38:06.478 --> 38:08.957
I should get back to
my friend's place.

38:08.958 --> 38:10.542
I've not got a key.

38:12.478 --> 38:13.478
OK.

38:18.558 --> 38:19.558
I love that.

38:43.638 --> 38:44.722
I've got a...

38:49.558 --> 38:51.058
- A beetle.
- Yeah.

39:09.718 --> 39:11.968
You're unbelievably lovely.

39:12.798 --> 39:14.558
You are.

39:14.638 --> 39:15.638
You are.

40:27.998 --> 40:30.665
Do you know what I'm looking at?

40:30.958 --> 40:31.958
No.

40:33.358 --> 40:35.758
Your supraorbital eminences.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.472
This is your mandible.

40:45.038 --> 40:48.705
Guess how many bones
you've got in your body.

40:49.198 --> 40:51.278
- 92.
- 206.

40:51.358 --> 40:52.438
Nah.

40:52.518 --> 40:53.998
Approximately.

40:54.078 --> 40:56.757
Babies have more and then
they fuse together.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.598
How do you know?

40:58.678 --> 41:01.917
I'm doing a forensic science course
SIFA's running.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.668
It's an online thing.

41:04.438 --> 41:05.478
Clever.

41:05.558 --> 41:07.392
Yeah, I'm very clever.

41:08.638 --> 41:11.317
Is that you or me?

41:11.318 --> 41:12.998
You.

41:13.078 --> 41:15.828
- You should see who it is.
- Why?

41:15.878 --> 41:18.918
It's late. Might be important.

41:18.998 --> 41:23.415
And I'd like to see you walk
over there and walk back.

41:41.078 --> 41:42.878
It's from Julie.

41:42.958 --> 41:43.958
My aunt.

41:45.398 --> 41:46.917
Julie's up very late.

41:46.918 --> 41:48.998
Julie has insomnia.

41:49.078 --> 41:51.038
Poor Julie.

41:51.118 --> 41:52.535
What did she say?

41:53.358 --> 41:56.638
"Apology accepted. I love you."

41:56.718 --> 42:00.302
What did you need to
apologise to Julie for?

42:00.398 --> 42:01.957
Putting the phone down on her.

42:01.958 --> 42:04.038
Oh, nasty.>

42:04.118 --> 42:05.118
What for?

42:06.158 --> 42:08.492
Aunt Julie wants a chat now.

42:09.078 --> 42:11.412
It's not Julie. It's my dad.

42:13.078 --> 42:16.437
- Hi, Dad.
- We need to talk about that photo.

42:16.438 --> 42:18.957
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

42:18.958 --> 42:21.357
- What, how did you...?
- I'm not going over this on the phone.

42:21.358 --> 42:24.237
- Come over in the morning.
- I've got work. I don't care.

42:24.238 --> 42:25.405
Just get here.

42:32.278 --> 42:33.278
What's up?

42:34.438 --> 42:36.855
I've got myself into trouble.

42:37.238 --> 42:38.988
What sort of trouble?

42:40.118 --> 42:41.535
I don't know yet.
