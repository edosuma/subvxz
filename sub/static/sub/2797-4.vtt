00:19.166 --> 00:21.125
Where do you think you're going?

00:21.208 --> 00:24.333
-Oh, up the wall.
-Yeah, okay. Guess I'll Ninja Sprint!

00:26.125 --> 00:28.750
Nah, I don't think so.

00:32.709 --> 00:34.041
-(growling)
-(beeping)

00:34.959 --> 00:37.417
Just one second. I'm so sorry.
Status update, Howard.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.333
Bash is giving out invites
to his party right now.

00:40.417 --> 00:42.083
Boom! Boom!

00:42.166 --> 00:43.917
Show your Bash mark at the door.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
(chuckles)
Boom!

00:45.083 --> 00:47.875
We cannot miss the Bash Splash.
It's legendary!

00:47.959 --> 00:51.208
I heard last year they filled the pool
with McSquiddles.

00:51.291 --> 00:53.750
McSquiddles! Lick the lightning!

00:54.834 --> 00:57.291
On my way. Just gotta brain the lizard.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.583
Ninja Sneeze!
(sneezes)

01:04.166 --> 01:05.000
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

01:05.083 --> 01:06.583
Oh, schnasty!

01:07.375 --> 01:09.709
What the juice? He's gone.

01:09.792 --> 01:11.875
(Howard) <i>So is our shot at Bash Splash.</i>

01:11.959 --> 01:15.000
Lizard, Bash Splash. Lizard, Bash Splash.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.834
What to do, what to do?
He only ate a booger.

01:17.917 --> 01:20.000
There's no way
that could come back to haunt me.

01:20.083 --> 01:21.125
(yells)

01:23.583 --> 01:27.125
Boom! Boom!

01:29.041 --> 01:30.583
You two are in my gym class.

01:30.667 --> 01:32.333
You wear them zip-up kicks.

01:32.417 --> 01:34.375
-Yeah, we do.
-Check 'em out.

01:36.709 --> 01:39.291
Zip-ups is for shoobies. No Bash!

01:39.375 --> 01:42.125
Ah, why do you have to be such a shoobie?

01:42.875 --> 01:46.125
The greatest party in the history
of high school and we're not invited.

01:46.208 --> 01:48.792
This burns, man. This burns deep.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.917
Yeah, it's too bad we can't just sneak in.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.667
I mean, it's not like one of us
is the ninja or anything.

01:54.750 --> 01:58.417
Howard, I can't just ninja out
because we want to go to Bash's party.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.542
Now, if Bash's stepdad
was my arch-nemesis, or...

02:01.625 --> 02:03.709
Oh, my ninja!

02:03.792 --> 02:05.250
I'll be in the Nomicon.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.542
And I'll be in <i>Grave Punchers Four.</i>

02:07.625 --> 02:10.291
<i>Punchzilla's Revenge,</i>
<i>Punch Master Edition.</i>

02:13.000 --> 02:17.083
(Randy) <i>"A ninja must master</i>

02:17.166 --> 02:18.458
<i>Reveal, conceal.</i>

02:18.542 --> 02:21.458
<i>Conceal, reveal.</i>

02:21.542 --> 02:25.000
Camouflage! Ah, that is so brute.

02:25.083 --> 02:27.250
-(gasps)
-Jab, jab. Haymaker!

02:27.333 --> 02:29.125
-Howard!
-(game) <i>Congratulations.</i>

02:29.208 --> 02:31.208
<i>You are a world's</i>
<i>worstest grave puncher.</i>

02:31.291 --> 02:33.625
Oh! This better be good, Cunningham.

02:33.709 --> 02:35.959
Good? It's only the cheese.

02:36.041 --> 02:38.917
I got us two tickets to the Bash Splash.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.542
(Randy) Throw the haymaker!

02:40.625 --> 02:43.583
The Nomicon told you
to tell me to deck you?

02:43.667 --> 02:45.000
I've always liked that book.

02:45.083 --> 02:46.875
So, how we getting into the Bash Splash?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.583
Yes, this is how.

02:48.667 --> 02:50.792
Everybody at that party
will have a Bash mark,

02:50.875 --> 02:52.000
including us.

02:52.083 --> 02:55.083
Now if the world's worstest
grave puncher would hurry up...

02:55.166 --> 02:56.375
Ow!

02:56.458 --> 02:58.750
No one jokes about my grave punching.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.458
Huh?

03:00.542 --> 03:01.959
Ooh, ooh, do me, do me!

03:02.041 --> 03:03.458
-(punching)
-(Howard shouts)

03:03.542 --> 03:05.333
(both) We're gonna crash the Bash Splash!

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Look at that beautiful ninja slinger.

03:14.458 --> 03:17.417
Jelly, slightly ropey, and that color.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.583
Focus, Viceroy. Bash's party

03:19.667 --> 03:22.333
will be filled with the coolest kids
at Norrisville High.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.625
Surely one of them is the ninja.

03:24.709 --> 03:26.500
Thanks to this snot sample,

03:26.583 --> 03:29.500
we'll finally learn his true identity!

03:29.583 --> 03:33.041
(beeping)

03:34.000 --> 03:35.875
You're a genius. We're in.

03:37.750 --> 03:41.125
Check it out. It's gotta be over 173 feet.

03:41.208 --> 03:42.500
(chirping)

03:42.583 --> 03:43.917
Do you know what that means?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.041
I do not.

03:45.125 --> 03:48.834
It's the highest board in Norrisville.
I can pull the ultimate belly whopper.

03:48.917 --> 03:53.000
Finally, I'll show Uncle Rod
that I'm the king of the Weinerman Whop.

03:53.083 --> 03:54.834
Bash alert. Something o'clock.

03:54.917 --> 03:55.750
(shouts)

03:55.834 --> 03:59.000
Hannibal, Bashford refuses
to re-apply his SPF.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.125
Oh, my baby boy is gonna get burned
for jeeper's sake.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.750
(grumbles)

04:04.834 --> 04:06.750
Hey! Cut it out, McJerk!

04:07.667 --> 04:10.834
That was close. And a little sad.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.166
If Bash recognizes us, we're booted.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.792
-For realsies.
-I'm with ya'.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.333
We need to make sure we blend in.

04:16.417 --> 04:18.250
Stay off Bash's radar, lay low.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.709
Is that a choco-fountain?

04:20.792 --> 04:22.709
Yes. Yes, it is.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.500
(lapping)

04:24.583 --> 04:25.750
(shrieking)

04:26.542 --> 04:28.542
Bash Splash! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

04:30.250 --> 04:33.208
That was even closer.
We were right under his nose, and...

04:33.291 --> 04:34.542
(both) Sumo Slide!

04:34.625 --> 04:36.875
Right behind you, Big H.

04:36.959 --> 04:37.875
Hooray!

04:37.959 --> 04:40.000
(both shouting)

04:40.083 --> 04:41.542
(both gasping)

04:44.583 --> 04:46.083
(Bash) Bash Splash!

04:48.417 --> 04:50.291
(groans)
Dude, is it me,

04:50.375 --> 04:53.125
or are we totally pulling this off?

04:53.208 --> 04:55.875
Hmm? Well, who do we have here?

04:55.959 --> 04:58.125
McFist. I mean, hello.

04:58.208 --> 04:59.500
Nice to meet you, Mr. McFist,

04:59.583 --> 05:02.000
as you and I have never met
in the past, ever.

05:02.083 --> 05:04.125
We're Bashford's school chums.
Here we are.

05:04.208 --> 05:05.875
By the way, Bash is not an idiot.

05:05.959 --> 05:08.375
Bash Splash, Bash Splash, Bash Splash!

05:08.458 --> 05:10.083
Yeah, he's a delight.

05:10.166 --> 05:13.417
Hiya, boys.
Hope you're enjoying Bashy's Splashy.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.500
Oh, have you blown your nose yet?

05:15.583 --> 05:16.500
(both) Huh?

05:16.583 --> 05:20.083
(clears throat)
McFist Industries is proud to announce

05:20.166 --> 05:23.166
the revolution
in nostril clearing technology.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.417
McFissues.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.667
For your blow and go lifestyle.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.500
(Marcy) Sneeze into Atchoo D2,

05:29.583 --> 05:31.542
play Schnoz Sniper,

05:31.625 --> 05:33.625
or just try your hand
at Pick It and Flick It.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.667
Ah, it's a hoot!

05:35.750 --> 05:37.041
What is it, boogers?

05:37.125 --> 05:39.041
Just make sure you take a picture

05:39.125 --> 05:41.583
so we can ID your icky.

05:41.667 --> 05:42.583
(laughing)

05:45.625 --> 05:47.583
Don't have any bats in the cave.

05:47.667 --> 05:50.500
Boogie shy, huh? No problem.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.250
Robo-lizard! What the juice?

05:55.917 --> 05:58.417
Not...gonna...sneeze.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.834
I'm gonna sneeze!

05:59.917 --> 06:01.625
-(sneezes)
-(clicking)

06:03.500 --> 06:04.792
Gesundheit.

06:05.291 --> 06:07.208
Enjoy the party.

06:07.291 --> 06:08.375
-(gasping)
-(horse neighing)

06:08.458 --> 06:10.500
Guess who won heaviest tissue?

06:10.583 --> 06:12.291
A robo-lizard snagged my snot.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.917
McFist has a finger in the nose
of every kid here.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.458
I have to find out why.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.375
But I'll need a distraction.

06:18.917 --> 06:21.041
Howard, warm me up a whopper.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.291
-What about laying low?
-There's a time to lay low,

06:23.375 --> 06:24.917
and there's a time to whop.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.250
Go show Uncle Rod
why you wear the big trunks.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.458
(laughing)

06:30.417 --> 06:32.375
-Bash Splash!
-(Howard) Hey, Bash.

06:33.208 --> 06:35.041
I know you. You're that shoe.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.792
You weren't supposed to be Bashed!

06:36.875 --> 06:39.542
That's right, I crashed the Bash Splash.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.542
What you gonna do about it?

06:41.625 --> 06:42.959
Get him, bros!

06:44.000 --> 06:45.125
Huh?

06:52.291 --> 06:54.875
(panting)

06:58.333 --> 07:00.333
Ninja Foot Spikes!

07:04.250 --> 07:06.208
You're not blending on me this time.

07:08.875 --> 07:11.041
(all shouting)

07:14.000 --> 07:16.083
Fabulous work.

07:16.166 --> 07:20.291
Now we simply wait for one
of these nose nuggets to match the ninja.

07:20.375 --> 07:21.583
Can you say smoothie time?

07:21.667 --> 07:23.000
Gesundheit.

07:23.083 --> 07:26.083
I really must start reading to you.

07:27.709 --> 07:30.041
Boogers. Boogers, boogers.

07:31.583 --> 07:32.792
They're all boogers!

07:32.875 --> 07:36.750
(panting)

07:36.834 --> 07:37.834
(beeping)

07:37.917 --> 07:39.875
This better be good.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.542
Ooh, that is good! Be right there.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.625
Sorry, bugaboo. Gotta get to the lab.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.417
I'm seconds away from having the ninja

07:46.500 --> 07:47.834
right where I want him.

07:47.917 --> 07:49.625
You are so adorable

07:49.709 --> 07:51.959
when you're scheming to destroy the ninja.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.166
-(slurping)
-Uh-huh, okay.

07:56.458 --> 07:57.792
What the juice?

07:57.875 --> 08:01.250
(machine) <i>Heidi Weinerman. No match.</i>

08:01.333 --> 08:03.291
<i>Mike Moe. No match.</i>

08:06.792 --> 08:08.000
That's my booger.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.208
(grunting)

08:09.291 --> 08:11.458
(laughing)

08:11.542 --> 08:13.291
(grunting)

08:14.208 --> 08:15.792
Oh, schnasty!

08:15.875 --> 08:19.000
This is it, Viceroy. The ninja is toast.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.583
Gotta get my booger back.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.500
The art of stealth. Conceal and reveal.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.041
Conceal ain't doing jack.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.709
Time to switch to reveal.

08:26.792 --> 08:28.709
You boys looking for me?

08:28.792 --> 08:30.667
Ninja! Ha!

08:30.750 --> 08:32.250
Told ya' he'd be at the Splash.

08:32.333 --> 08:33.917
Nailed it again, sir.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.583
Sorry to break up
your little phlegm fiesta,

08:36.667 --> 08:39.083
but you've got some lung butter
that belongs to me.

08:39.917 --> 08:41.000
(computer) <i>Ninja found.</i>

08:41.083 --> 08:42.500
We got a match!

08:42.583 --> 08:44.750
-Oh, boy.
-You're too late, ninja.

08:47.625 --> 08:48.834
Or should I call you...

08:48.917 --> 08:50.583
(sneezing)

08:51.500 --> 08:52.834
(computer) <i>Viceroy match.</i>

08:52.917 --> 08:54.750
Viceroy. Viceroy?

08:54.834 --> 08:56.709
-Viceroy!
-Seriously?

08:56.792 --> 08:58.917
How could I be the ninja,
he's standing right there.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.542
Ninja Kick!

09:01.125 --> 09:03.625
Well, I pretty much adios'd
your booger machine,

09:03.709 --> 09:05.250
so smoke bomb!

09:05.333 --> 09:08.250
Ha! Idiot. We can rebuild the machine.

09:08.333 --> 09:11.333
The important thing is
we've still got all the samples.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.291
Huh. Had not thought of that.

09:14.333 --> 09:17.041
(yells)

09:17.875 --> 09:18.875
Stop him!

09:21.709 --> 09:23.917
Wow, that's a lot of robo-lizards.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.542
I'm gonna whop!

09:25.625 --> 09:27.125
You ain't whoppin' on my watch.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.792
-Yeah.
-(laughing)

09:28.875 --> 09:30.375
(all) Aw.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.875
(all screaming)

09:38.458 --> 09:39.417
Ole!

09:39.500 --> 09:43.458
(grunting)

09:43.542 --> 09:45.375
(screaming)

09:48.750 --> 09:50.333
(laughs)
Boom!

09:50.417 --> 09:53.041
Okay, I admit. This is a setback.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.375
But we still have the boogers.

09:54.458 --> 09:56.792
We put 'em on new slides,
rebuild the machine,

09:56.875 --> 09:57.959
and ha! Back in business.

09:58.041 --> 09:59.291
Come on, McFist.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.625
Don't you think it's time
to throw in the tissue?

10:01.709 --> 10:03.709
-(rumbling)
-(growling)

10:07.750 --> 10:08.750
Ninja Ring!

10:14.834 --> 10:18.000
(whimpering, groaning)

10:18.083 --> 10:20.834
(all cheering)

10:20.917 --> 10:22.917
Yeah!
(groans)

10:23.375 --> 10:24.291
Worth it.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.166
Ninja Surf!

10:28.375 --> 10:30.375
The water's all booger-ey.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.500
So gross!

10:38.041 --> 10:39.667
Oh, hey, buddy. We're busted.

10:40.417 --> 10:41.959
Nice try, shoobies.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.291
Nobody crashes the Bash Splash!

10:46.709 --> 10:47.750
(horse neighing)

10:47.834 --> 10:49.875
Oh, look what they did to Uni!

10:49.959 --> 10:51.458
This party was a total disaster.

10:51.542 --> 10:52.709
What are you talking about?

10:52.792 --> 10:54.792
You're the king of the Weinerman Whop.

10:54.875 --> 10:56.583
And I protected the ninja's identity.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.583
And I won heaviest tissue.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.041
See, that's the spirit.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.500
Not bad for our first
high school party, right?

11:03.583 --> 11:05.500
Schweet! Fireworks.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.500
Fireworks filled with McSquiddles.

11:08.583 --> 11:09.625
(both) Lick the lightning!

11:09.709 --> 11:12.834
-Hot, super-hot!
-Mmm, so good.

11:12.917 --> 11:16.458
(both chattering)

11:17.041 --> 11:19.000
(shouting)

11:20.166 --> 11:21.375
That...
(groans)

11:21.458 --> 11:23.625
...hurt. Uh-oh.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.667
(growling)

11:26.792 --> 11:28.500
Smoke bomb!

11:30.458 --> 11:31.709
(confused growl)

11:33.542 --> 11:35.625
OK, Nomicon. Little help here.

11:40.917 --> 11:45.417
(Randy) <i>"When faced with a mighty enemy,</i>
<i>counter with a mightier force."</i>

11:47.750 --> 11:49.125
Mightier force?

11:49.208 --> 11:51.792
What's mightier than a killer robot?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.458
Ninja Chain-sicle!

11:56.542 --> 11:57.792
(shouting)

12:01.667 --> 12:02.709
Uh-oh.

12:02.792 --> 12:04.041
(yells)

12:09.834 --> 12:12.500
(groans)
Robo-burp!

12:12.583 --> 12:15.667
I totally tasted that. It's in my mouth.
I can't get it out of my mouth.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.750
Counter with a mightier force.

12:22.834 --> 12:24.750
Here force. Aw, yeah!

12:24.834 --> 12:25.667
Shovel.

12:28.542 --> 12:29.583
(laughing)

12:31.333 --> 12:32.375
Uh-oh.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.500
(yells)
Gravity.

12:40.583 --> 12:43.667
That's a mightier force. Or is it a law?

12:43.750 --> 12:46.208
Man, I gotta start paying attention
in science class.

12:46.291 --> 12:47.625
Science class!

12:47.709 --> 12:49.041
(groaning)

12:50.291 --> 12:51.375
Huh?

12:51.458 --> 12:53.250
(static)

12:53.333 --> 12:55.333
Hmm.

12:55.417 --> 12:56.250
(farting sound)

12:56.417 --> 12:58.250
(laughs)
Oh, no!

12:58.333 --> 13:01.166
Fart box. Howard's gonna love this.

13:01.250 --> 13:02.166
(bell ringing)

13:02.250 --> 13:03.834
In other words, Mr. Weinerman,

13:03.917 --> 13:08.500
if you were this bone
you'd be failing thigh school science.

13:08.583 --> 13:10.458
(laughing)

13:10.542 --> 13:12.166
Thigh school. Zing!

13:12.250 --> 13:13.792
(scoffs)
Brown noser.

13:13.875 --> 13:16.458
-Hey, Howard, did I miss anything?
-No.

13:16.542 --> 13:17.542
Ah, Mr. Cunningham.

13:17.625 --> 13:21.834
I was just telling your lab partner
that the two of you are failing my class.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.417
So I didn't miss anything.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.208
Oh, yeah. We're failing science.

13:25.291 --> 13:29.500
And the only way you two will pass
is if you win tomorrow's science fair.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.417
(scoffs)
That is no problem.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.375
We have a totally awesome project.

13:33.458 --> 13:34.375
You do?

13:34.458 --> 13:36.333
-Yes.
-We do?

13:36.417 --> 13:38.083
(whispers)
No.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.875
Well, we'll see tomorrow. But I warn you,

13:40.959 --> 13:45.041
you won't find failing science
very humorous.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.709
Oh, Jerry.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.542
(laughing)
Humorous.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.875
-Double zing!
-Brown noser.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.125
That's what I said.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.166
(McFist) You better not be coming in here

13:55.250 --> 13:57.458
to tell me your robot
failed to destroy the ninja.

13:57.542 --> 13:58.792
Never mind.

13:58.875 --> 14:01.583
Get back here,
I'm not done yelling at you!

14:01.667 --> 14:04.625
Oh, Hannibal. Inside voice.

14:04.709 --> 14:07.417
Yes, Marcy, my little sugar knuckles.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.417
Meatballs, sweet!

14:09.500 --> 14:11.583
Bashford, science fair is coming up,

14:11.667 --> 14:14.917
and I thought you two could do
a little father-stepson bonding

14:15.000 --> 14:16.834
working on his project together.

14:16.917 --> 14:19.375
When is this science fair?

14:19.458 --> 14:21.500
-It's tomorrow.
-What's the matter,

14:21.583 --> 14:23.959
couldn't wait
until the absolute last minute?

14:24.041 --> 14:25.917
(scoffs)
Dummy!

14:26.000 --> 14:28.458
There's like a ton of minutes
between now and tomorrow.

14:28.542 --> 14:31.875
I know you're busy hatching
evil schemes and so forth,

14:31.959 --> 14:33.375
but it sure would be swell.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.583
Anything, my little butter face.

14:35.667 --> 14:39.417
Oh, look at my two big,
strong science fellas!

14:39.500 --> 14:41.667
Hey, don't build me nothing stupid.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.417
Viceroy, get in here!

14:44.500 --> 14:46.291
(Viceroy) <i>Not if you're gonna yell at me.</i>

14:46.375 --> 14:47.625
I'm not gonna yell at you!

14:47.709 --> 14:48.834
(Ryan) Howard, this is it.

14:48.917 --> 14:51.458
We're gonna come up with
a first place science project.

14:51.542 --> 14:54.417
Right after I do, uh, this.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.834
-(farting sound)
-(both laughing)

14:56.917 --> 14:59.375
O-M-genius.

14:59.458 --> 15:00.959
Where'd you get the fart box?

15:01.041 --> 15:02.917
Took it off a McFist robot.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.583
-(farts)
-(both laugh)

15:04.667 --> 15:07.250
Oh, it farts. It just keeps farting!

15:07.333 --> 15:09.667
Oh. Okay, enough of that. Time to work.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.542
(laughing)

15:19.959 --> 15:21.500
It just keeps farting!

15:21.583 --> 15:24.750
(farting, laughing continues)

15:24.834 --> 15:26.125
(rooster crowing)

15:26.208 --> 15:27.959
Just keeps farting.

15:29.625 --> 15:32.959
-Never gets old.
-It really doesn't.

15:33.041 --> 15:35.417
Hey, what happened to the nighttime?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.166
We farted it away! Literally.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.583
What are we gonna do
about the science fair?

15:40.667 --> 15:43.417
-Okay, how about this?
-Really, now?

15:43.500 --> 15:46.583
No, we could use the box.
It's totally science-y.

15:46.667 --> 15:47.834
(loud fart)

15:47.917 --> 15:51.000
Hang on.
You want us to hand in the fart box

15:51.083 --> 15:52.792
off a killer robot as our project?

15:52.875 --> 15:54.959
-Mm-hmm.
-Cunningham, do you realize

15:55.041 --> 15:57.291
how incredibly stupid
it would be for us...

15:57.375 --> 15:59.000
Not to do that!

15:59.083 --> 16:02.208
Oh, I'm gonna clear some room
on my report card for an A plus.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.959
It'll be that sweet
little island of success

16:05.041 --> 16:06.583
on an ocean of D's.

16:10.083 --> 16:12.125
Behold. Ahh!

16:12.208 --> 16:15.834
A spud-powered TV remote
for the ultimate couch potato.

16:15.917 --> 16:18.208
Potato humor. Zing!

16:18.291 --> 16:19.917
(laughing)

16:20.000 --> 16:22.583
Science fair's in the bag.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.583
Hurry up, I ain't got all day!

16:24.667 --> 16:27.458
There. My invention...

16:27.542 --> 16:30.500
-My invention.
-Bash's invention

16:30.583 --> 16:34.959
converts common feline waste
into electricity.

16:35.041 --> 16:37.041
(meowing)

16:37.125 --> 16:39.375
I have a million billion dollars.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.125
Can't we get a cat that poops on command?

16:42.208 --> 16:44.834
Sorry. Fluffy gets stage fright.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.250
-(farting)
-(clinking)

16:46.333 --> 16:47.792
Ooh, there he goes.

16:47.875 --> 16:50.166
(Bash) The cat's doing poops!

16:51.542 --> 16:53.917
Quit showing off, fuzzball.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.875
Save some for the judges!

16:55.959 --> 16:59.166
Now, as you see,
our students put a lot of thought

16:59.250 --> 17:00.166
into their projects.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.458
They worked their fingers to the bone.

17:02.542 --> 17:04.792
Any chance one of 'em
came up with some sort

17:04.875 --> 17:07.041
of self-perpetuating,
artificial food stuff?

17:07.125 --> 17:09.041
(laughs)
I don't think so, why?

17:09.125 --> 17:13.166
No reason. Certainly not because
I diverted the semester's cafeteria budget

17:13.250 --> 17:14.625
to repairing my hoopty.

17:15.542 --> 17:17.458
(chuckles)
No.

17:17.542 --> 17:21.709
Well, boys, let's see
the totally awesome project you promised.

17:21.792 --> 17:23.709
Since the dawn of time,

17:23.792 --> 17:26.750
man has sought an escape from... silence.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.750
Today, his quest is over.

17:29.834 --> 17:30.709
(lights shutting off)

17:31.750 --> 17:35.792
-(blows kazoo)
-Behold, the wonder of sound.

17:35.875 --> 17:37.166
(loud farting)

17:37.250 --> 17:39.041
(both laughing)

17:40.041 --> 17:41.500
(quiet coughing)

17:42.375 --> 17:44.750
I think they missed it. Hit 'em again!

17:45.792 --> 17:47.917
(laughing)

17:48.667 --> 17:50.667
Boys, that is not science.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.250
But, no, no, no.
You push the button here...

17:53.333 --> 17:54.166
(farting)

17:54.250 --> 17:56.417
...and the sound comes out there.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.083
That's the very definition of science.

17:59.166 --> 18:02.458
No. It's the very definition of fail.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.125
(Howard) An F?!

18:04.208 --> 18:06.917
Please, Mr. Driscoll,
she's being totally unfair.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.792
(Mr. Driscoll)
You think you've got it bad.

18:08.875 --> 18:10.208
Try being married to her.

18:10.291 --> 18:14.000
Oh, Jerry. You're terrible.

18:16.333 --> 18:19.166
Stupid wonder of sound.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.834
Hey! My project!

18:24.917 --> 18:28.625
Whoa! I just scienced
this thing up a notch.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.041
Dude, we gotta show Driscoll!

18:30.125 --> 18:31.375
(gasps)

18:33.083 --> 18:34.834
(growling)

18:34.917 --> 18:36.917
Potato coming to life. No big deal.

18:40.834 --> 18:43.083
(whimpering)

18:43.166 --> 18:45.125
Okay, that's a big deal.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.166
Ninja time, definitely ninja time.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.166
Ninja Flip!

18:58.709 --> 19:00.375
Ninja Rotating Table Slide!

19:05.625 --> 19:07.083
(shouting)

19:10.041 --> 19:11.208
Ninja-side, hiya!

19:13.667 --> 19:16.083
Anyone order a side of fries?

19:16.166 --> 19:17.792
Ha! Potato humor.

19:17.875 --> 19:19.875
Ninja, you are the zing!

19:19.959 --> 19:22.375
(chuckles)
You said it, I didn't say it.

19:22.458 --> 19:23.667
-That was you.
-(growling)

19:23.750 --> 19:25.458
How 'bout that?

19:26.375 --> 19:27.709
Ha!

19:28.750 --> 19:30.834
(all screaming)

19:32.125 --> 19:34.625
(yells)

19:34.709 --> 19:38.875
Chop, chop, chop, chop!

19:41.333 --> 19:43.834
I really thought it would work that time.
I don't know why.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.834
(all growling)

19:50.000 --> 19:53.375
Oh, potatoes!
Potatoes, potatoes, potatoes, potatoes!

19:53.458 --> 19:55.375
Mrs. D, we just wanted you to know

19:55.458 --> 19:57.667
there's no hard feelings
about the F that you gave us.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.458
In fact,
we'd like to give you a second chance

20:00.542 --> 20:02.208
to give us a second chance.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.333
Mr. Weinerman, in case you hadn't noticed,

20:04.417 --> 20:06.542
we're being attacked by...
(gasps)

20:07.375 --> 20:09.000
Stupid Driscoll.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.417
Thinks she's the king of science.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.750
Not my biggest problem right now.

20:13.917 --> 20:14.959
(cat screeches)

20:15.041 --> 20:16.500
What is that?

20:16.583 --> 20:18.417
It's the number C, dummy.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.041
Thanks for nothing, McFist.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.250
You gave me a science guy
who can't even count to C.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.208
I'm telling Mom!

20:23.291 --> 20:25.125
I'm not afraid!

20:25.208 --> 20:28.375
Sir, if you're done
with your little domestic kerfuffle,

20:28.458 --> 20:31.542
there's a potato uprising
that may interest you.

20:36.208 --> 20:39.500
Ninja! Why didn't you think ahead
and bring a killer robot?

20:39.583 --> 20:40.709
Maybe I did.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.625
Well, did you or didn't you?

20:43.709 --> 20:46.542
Of course I did. What kind of evil genius
would I be if I didn't?

20:48.417 --> 20:50.750
(meowing)

20:51.333 --> 20:53.792
Ha, yes! Attack.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.625
What? Killer robot? Bring it on!

21:00.625 --> 21:02.500
(laughing)

21:03.750 --> 21:05.166
-(kid) My project!
-Sorry.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.583
Go robot!

21:07.291 --> 21:09.834
Yeah, to your doom.

21:09.917 --> 21:11.542
Yay, ninja.

21:12.542 --> 21:16.500
(Ryan) <i>"When faced with a mighty enemy,</i>
<i>counter with a mighty force."</i>

21:19.375 --> 21:21.291
Okay, giant robot.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.000
It's potato mashing time!

21:26.250 --> 21:27.750
Boom! Gravity.

21:27.834 --> 21:30.125
Science.

21:30.208 --> 21:32.208
-(meowing)
-Oh, boy.

21:34.959 --> 21:36.792
(squeaks)

21:37.625 --> 21:39.041
Okay, students.

21:39.125 --> 21:42.750
Whose project
caused those potatoes to mutate?

21:42.834 --> 21:46.125
Well, then, I guess we'll never know
who solved the school's food shortage,

21:46.208 --> 21:49.125
-and won first place.
-Right here.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.875
Why do we have to clean this up?

21:51.959 --> 21:53.583
Well, I mean, it was our science project

21:53.667 --> 21:56.625
that turned those innocent potatoes
into rampaging psycho spuds.

21:56.709 --> 21:59.000
Yeah.
Guess that's what we get for handing in

21:59.083 --> 22:00.792
someone else's fart box as our project.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.000
Hey, Howard.
We learned a valuable lesson today.

22:03.834 --> 22:06.750
(both laughing)

22:06.834 --> 22:08.917
Oh, valuable lesson.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.333
Where did you come up with that?

22:10.417 --> 22:12.750
I don't know.
I mean, it's a gift, it's a gift.

22:12.834 --> 22:15.000
-(farting)
-(Randy) Please tell me that was the box.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.667
(Howard)
Wish I could, buddy. Wish I could.

22:18.250 --> 22:22.417
