UH, WHY NOT?

07:45.133 --> 07:47.367
>> HEY, MY BAND JUST GOT THE

07:47.367 --> 07:49.133
COVETED 8:00 SPOT ON OPEN MIC

07:49.133 --> 07:49.933
NIGHT AT URBAN GRIND NEXT

07:49.933 --> 07:50.733
FRIDAY.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.433
>> SHOOT!

07:52.433 --> 07:53.733
THAT'S THE ONE NIGHT THE PRADA

07:53.733 --> 07:54.733
REP IS IN TOWN, AND WE ALREADY

07:54.733 --> 07:55.667
HAVE A DINNER MEETING.

07:55.667 --> 07:57.467
>> HEY, THAT'S OKAY, YOU KNOW?

07:57.467 --> 07:59.567
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

08:04.267 --> 08:05.633
>> I KNOW THE LAST FEW TIMES,

08:05.633 --> 08:06.633
YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR SCHEDULE FOR

08:06.633 --> 08:09.067
ME, SO I PROMISE, THE NEXT SHOW,

08:09.067 --> 08:10.667
I WILL BE THERE WITH A LIGHTER,

08:10.667 --> 08:11.500
GLOW STICKS.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.467
I'LL EVEN ACT ALL JEALOUS AND

08:12.467 --> 08:13.233
BEAT UP YOUR GROUPIES.

08:13.233 --> 08:14.467
>> [laughs]

08:14.467 --> 08:15.467
OKAY.

08:15.467 --> 08:17.233
WELL, I'VE ONLY GOT THE ONE, BUT

08:17.233 --> 08:20.200
I'LL GIVE MY MOM THE HEADS UP.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.400
>> [laughs]

08:21.400 --> 08:22.333
>> JUST LIKE I'M GIVING YOU NOW,

08:22.333 --> 08:24.300
'CAUSE I AM ABOUT TO SPANK YOU.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.500
MMM!

08:25.500 --> 08:28.733
UH, AT UNO, I MEAN.

08:28.733 --> 08:29.767
>> BRING IT, BROTHER.

08:35.067 --> 08:37.733
>> MOVE.

08:37.733 --> 08:38.800
>> REALLY?

08:38.800 --> 08:40.467
CHARLES, THAT ONE?

08:40.467 --> 08:41.367
>> YOU KNOW, YOUR LITTLE MIND

08:41.367 --> 08:43.333
TRICKS ARE FUTILE, GRASSHOPPER.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.467
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT BEAT ME AT

08:44.467 --> 08:46.167
THOSE OTHER GAMES, BUT I AM THE

08:46.167 --> 08:49.200
JENGA ZEN MASTER, OKAY?

08:52.067 --> 08:53.067
[clatter]

08:53.067 --> 08:54.500
DAMN IT.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.067
>> YES!

08:56.067 --> 08:58.067
YES, YES, YES!

08:58.067 --> 08:59.867
I WHIPPED YOUR BUTT AT UNO,

08:59.867 --> 09:01.600
SCATTERGORIES, AND JENGA.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.133
WHO'S THE MASTER NOW, HUH?

09:04.133 --> 09:06.267
[laughs]

09:10.600 --> 09:12.300
>> SERIOUSLY...

09:12.300 --> 09:13.700
>> [laughs]

09:13.700 --> 09:15.367
>> NOW I'M TIRED.

09:15.367 --> 09:16.467
>> OF WHAT?

09:16.467 --> 09:18.867
LOSING?

09:18.867 --> 09:21.867
SERIOUSLY, I HAD FUN TONIGHT.

09:23.267 --> 09:24.600
>> GOOD NIGHT.

09:30.367 --> 09:31.600
>> WELL, OKAY.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.800
[sighs]

09:36.067 --> 09:37.067
[techno music]

09:37.067 --> 09:40.600
*

09:40.600 --> 09:42.667
>> NICOLETTE'S 30 MINUTES LATE.

09:42.667 --> 09:43.867
SHOULD I CALL AND MAKE SURE

09:43.867 --> 09:44.967
SHE'S STILL COMING?

09:44.967 --> 09:46.100
>> SHE'S PROBABLY JUST ON

09:46.100 --> 09:47.133
FABULOUS TIME.

09:47.133 --> 09:48.167
I'VE HEARD STORIES ABOUT HER

09:48.167 --> 09:49.733
BEING A CRAZY, OVER-THE TOP,

09:49.733 --> 09:50.833
DIVA BITCH.

09:50.833 --> 09:52.700
>> YOU CAN'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING

09:52.700 --> 09:53.967
YOU HEAR, OMAR.

09:53.967 --> 09:54.900
>> I DON'T KNOW.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.433
TMZ SAID SHE THREW A SHOE AT A

09:56.433 --> 09:58.067
WAITER WHO ACCIDENTALLY STEPPED

09:58.067 --> 09:59.067
ON HER FOOT.

09:59.067 --> 09:59.833
>> WOW.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.900
I HOPE SHE'S IN A GOOD MOOD

10:00.900 --> 10:01.733
TODAY.

10:01.733 --> 10:02.800
I WANT TO GET A PICTURE WITH HER

10:02.800 --> 10:04.100
FOR MY CELEBRITY COLLECTION.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.533
I ALREADY HAVE TWO.

10:05.533 --> 10:07.133
RONNIE FROM BELL BIV DEVOE

10:07.133 --> 10:08.067
AND THE FAT GUY FROM HEAD OF THE

10:08.067 --> 10:08.867
CLASS.

10:08.867 --> 10:11.000
I FORGET HIS NAME.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.967
MMM, HELLO, MR. FINE DELIVERY

10:12.967 --> 10:14.067
MAN.

10:14.067 --> 10:15.200
>> SORRY, BUT UNLESS YOU'RE

10:15.200 --> 10:16.133
HIDING SOMETHING UNDER YOUR

10:16.133 --> 10:18.067
SKIRT, YOU'RE NOT HIS TYPE.

10:18.067 --> 10:20.033
MARIO LIKES BOYS.

10:20.033 --> 10:22.133
>> OH!

10:22.133 --> 10:23.200
EXCUSE ME.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.467
>> OF COURSE.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.467
HI, MARIO.

10:26.467 --> 10:27.267
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

10:27.267 --> 10:28.767
WE CLOSED EARLY FOR A MEETING.

10:28.767 --> 10:30.033
>> NO PROBLEM, OMAR.

10:30.033 --> 10:32.400
GOT A COUPLE OF "DOLSAY" AND

10:32.400 --> 10:33.967
"GOBANANA" BOXES.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.233
>> I'VE TOLD YOU, IT'S DOLCE

10:35.233 --> 10:35.900
AND--

10:35.900 --> 10:36.667
>> I'M JUST MESSING WITH YOU,

10:36.667 --> 10:37.867
MAN.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.633
>> YOU GET ME EVERY TIME.

10:39.633 --> 10:40.467
>> YEP.

10:40.467 --> 10:41.700
COOL.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.767
SEE YOU IN A FEW DAYS.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.767
>> BYE, NOW.

10:46.900 --> 10:47.600
>> OMAR, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING

10:47.600 --> 10:48.467
FOR?

10:48.467 --> 10:49.267
JUST ASK HIM OUT.

10:49.267 --> 10:49.933
>> SOON.

10:49.933 --> 10:50.767
RIGHT NOW, I'M LAYING THE

10:50.767 --> 10:52.033
GROUNDWORK.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.867
>> OH, SHE'S HERE!

10:53.867 --> 10:54.867
SHE'S HERE.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.100
>> NICOLETTE, WELCOME.

11:00.100 --> 11:00.867
I'M RAQUEL.

11:00.867 --> 11:01.800
>> HI, RAQUEL.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.100
I AM SO SORRY I'M LATE.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.967
I CONFUSED PEACHTREE STREET WITH

11:04.967 --> 11:06.600
PEACHTREE ROAD, WHICH SOMEHOW

11:06.600 --> 11:07.300
TURNED OUT TO BE PEACHTREE

11:07.300 --> 11:07.967
DRIVE.

11:07.967 --> 11:08.967
[laughter]

11:08.967 --> 11:09.733
>> IT'S HARD.

11:09.733 --> 11:11.267
EVEN THOSE OF US BORN HERE STILL

11:11.267 --> 11:12.933
GET MESSED UP SOMETIMES.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.067
>> HI, I'M NICOLETTE.

11:14.067 --> 11:14.900
>> I'M OMAR.

11:14.900 --> 11:15.900
THIS IS MORGAN.

11:15.900 --> 11:16.767
>> PEOPLE SAY WE LOOK ALIKE.

11:16.767 --> 11:18.233
>> REALLY?

11:18.233 --> 11:19.767
YOU KNOW, MAYBE A LITTLE, AROUND

11:19.767 --> 11:20.533
THE EYES.

11:20.533 --> 11:21.267
>> EXACTLY.

11:21.267 --> 11:22.400
DO YOU MIND IF WE TAKE A PICTURE

11:22.400 --> 11:23.400
TOGETHER?

11:23.400 --> 11:24.400
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.300
YOU'RE ADORABLE.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.800
I'LL TELL MY MOM I HAVE A TWIN.

11:29.800 --> 11:30.467
>> MMM!

11:30.467 --> 11:31.167
>> OH, THANKS.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.400
>> OH!

11:37.567 --> 11:40.067
NICOLETTE, YOUR LINE IS AMAZING.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.133
>> THANK YOU.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.467
I'M VERY METICULOUS ABOUT THE

11:42.467 --> 11:43.267
DETAILS.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.167
>> AND IT SHOWS.

11:44.167 --> 11:46.400
I HOPE YOU'LL LET ME CARRY EVERY

11:46.400 --> 11:47.733
SINGLE ITEM.

11:47.733 --> 11:48.700
>> WELL, I'M SUPER PICKY ABOUT

11:48.700 --> 11:50.267
WHO I DO BUSINESS WITH, BUT I

11:50.267 --> 11:51.900
LIKE YOU, RAQUEL.

11:51.900 --> 11:52.700
LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN.

11:52.700 --> 11:53.767
>> GREAT.

11:53.767 --> 11:54.567
I'LL HAVE MY ATTORNEY DO THE

11:54.567 --> 11:57.400
CONTRACT.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.700
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE IN TOWN?

11:58.700 --> 11:59.900
>> INDEFINITELY.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.067
IN FACT, I'M ABOUT TO START

12:01.067 --> 12:02.067
LOOKING FOR A HOUSE.

12:02.067 --> 12:03.267
>> THEN YOU SHOULD TALK TO MY

12:03.267 --> 12:04.167
GIRLFRIEND KEISHA.

12:04.167 --> 12:05.433
SHE'S AN EXCELLENT REALTOR WHO

12:05.433 --> 12:06.833
KNOWS ATLANTA'S HIGH-END MARKET.

12:06.833 --> 12:07.800
>> I'D LIKE TO TALK TO HER.

12:07.800 --> 12:08.733
PLEASE, HAVE HER CONTACT MY

12:08.733 --> 12:10.067
ASSISTANT.

12:10.067 --> 12:12.233
THANK YOU, OMAR.

12:12.233 --> 12:13.500
>> HERE YOU GO.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.600
>> MMM!

12:16.833 --> 12:20.200
>> I LOVE HER.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.867
>> YOU?

12:21.867 --> 12:23.467
I'M CHANGING PEANUT'S NAME TO

12:23.467 --> 12:24.200
NICOLETTE.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
>> UHH!

12:30.533 --> 12:31.200
>> * COME ON

12:31.200 --> 12:32.200
[upbeat music]

12:32.200 --> 12:35.100
*

12:35.100 --> 12:38.067
>> RAQUEL, YOU HOOKED ME UP.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.100
NICOLETTE AND I ARE HAVING LUNCH

12:39.100 --> 12:39.967
TOMORROW BEFORE WE LOOK AT

12:39.967 --> 12:40.667
HOUSES.

12:40.667 --> 12:41.667
>> GLAD I COULD SPREAD THE LOVE.

12:41.667 --> 12:43.200
HAVING HER BUSINESS IS A COUP

12:43.200 --> 12:44.400
FOR ME TOO.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.400
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE CHARLES TAKE

12:45.400 --> 12:47.300
YOU OUT TO CELEBRATE.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.600
>> MAYBE IN A FEW DAYS.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.600
I THINK HE NEEDS SOME TIME TO

12:50.600 --> 12:51.667
COOL OFF.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.067
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

12:53.067 --> 12:54.500
YOU TWO LOOKED VERY COZY WHEN I

12:54.500 --> 12:55.400
LEFT YOU LAST NIGHT.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.067
>> WE WERE, UNTIL I BEAT HIM AT

12:57.067 --> 12:58.633
A FEW BOARD GAMES AND HE GOT

12:58.633 --> 12:59.433
KIND OF MAD.

12:59.433 --> 13:00.267
>> TYPICAL.

13:00.267 --> 13:01.833
>> MEN.

13:01.833 --> 13:02.567
>> MAYBE FOR MOST GUYS, BUT

13:02.567 --> 13:04.800
CHARLES IS SO EVOLVED.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.433
I'M JUST SURPRISED HE TURNED OUT

13:06.433 --> 13:08.300
TO BE SUCH A POOR SPORT.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.900
>> HE'S STILL A MAN, AND MALE

13:09.900 --> 13:11.400
EGOS ARE FRAGILE AND

13:11.400 --> 13:12.300
COMPLICATED.

13:12.300 --> 13:13.833
I MEAN, WE'RE PRETTY SIMPLE.

13:13.833 --> 13:14.933
>> TRUE.

13:14.933 --> 13:16.133
DO YOU KNOW LAST NIGHT, REGGIE

13:16.133 --> 13:17.400
ASKED ME TO CHANGE MY CLOTHES

13:17.400 --> 13:18.233
BECAUSE I WASN'T DRESSED UP

13:18.233 --> 13:18.900
ENOUGH FOR OUR DATE?

13:18.900 --> 13:20.433
>> GIRL, THE WAY YOUR FEET WERE

13:20.433 --> 13:21.500
HURTING YOU, YOU SHOULD HAVE

13:21.500 --> 13:23.067
JUST TOLD HIM TO RUB 'EM.

13:23.067 --> 13:23.800
>> OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.300
IT'S WAY TOO SOON FOR HER TO GET

13:25.300 --> 13:26.500
THAT COMFORTABLE WITH REGGIE.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.667
APRIL, BE HONEST.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.233
IF IT HAD BEEN A SECOND DATE

13:30.233 --> 13:31.867
WITH A NEW GUY, WOULD YOU HAVE

13:31.867 --> 13:33.667
DRESSED DOWN?

13:33.667 --> 13:34.667
>> NO.

13:34.667 --> 13:35.467
>> YOU CAN'T TREAT YOUR

13:35.467 --> 13:36.633
BOYFRIEND LIKE YOUR GIRLFRIENDS.

13:36.633 --> 13:39.233
>> OR HONORARY GIRLFRIENDS.

13:39.233 --> 13:41.133
>> MMM.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.667
>> I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO

13:42.667 --> 13:44.600
INCLUDE ME, BUT DON'T.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.533
>> THANKS.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.467
I WAS JUST CHECKING OUT THE

13:46.467 --> 13:47.767
RESTAURANT JOBARI IS TAKING ME

13:47.767 --> 13:48.600
OUT TO.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.667
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:49.667 --> 13:50.500
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT

13:50.500 --> 13:51.900
SINCE YOU ASKED HIM OUT, HE

13:51.900 --> 13:53.167
MIGHT EXPECT FOR YOU TO PAY.

13:53.167 --> 13:54.200
>> BUT HE'S A MAN.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.400
MEN ALWAYS PAY.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.933
>> GIRL, I WISH A MOTHER--OH!

13:56.933 --> 13:58.433
OH, MY BAD.

13:58.433 --> 13:59.867
I WISH A MAN WOULD ASK ME TO

13:59.867 --> 14:00.967
PAY.

14:00.967 --> 14:01.933
GOOD-BYE WOULD BE SO MUCH

14:01.933 --> 14:02.800
QUICKER.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.500
>> YOU KNOW, A FREE MEAL MIGHT

14:04.500 --> 14:05.967
NOT BE ALL HE'S EXPECTING.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.300
>> UHH!

14:07.300 --> 14:08.067
>> SOME GUYS THINK THAT WHEN A

14:08.067 --> 14:09.067
WOMAN PURSUES THEM, THEY'RE

14:09.067 --> 14:10.733
DEFINITELY GETTING SEX.

14:10.733 --> 14:11.400
>> SERIOUSLY?

14:11.400 --> 14:12.067
>> NO WAY.

14:12.067 --> 14:12.867
>> WELL, HE'D BE OUT OF HIS DAMN

14:12.867 --> 14:14.067
MIND.

14:14.067 --> 14:15.200
>> I COULD SEE WHERE A GUY MIGHT

14:15.200 --> 14:15.900
THINK THAT.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.133
MEN ASK WOMEN OUT ON A DATE TO

14:18.133 --> 14:19.467
CONVINCE US TO HAVE SEX.

14:19.467 --> 14:20.733
IF WE ASK FOR THE DATE, THEY'RE

14:20.733 --> 14:22.200
CONVINCED WE ALREADY WANT IT.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.867
LIKE YOU SAID, THEY'RE SIMPLE.

14:23.867 --> 14:25.567
>> PRETTY MUCH.

30:08.933 --> 30:10.033
MOST ABOUT YOU WHEN WE WERE

>> AND WHAT I LIKED ABOUT YOU

30:13.533 --> 30:14.300
WAS THAT YOU WERE SO

>> WELL, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

30:24.800 --> 30:27.033
THINKING, THEN I'M SURE IT IS.

30:27.033 --> 30:28.533
WE WERE MUCH BETTER AS FRIENDS.

30:28.533 --> 30:29.533
>> FINE, THEN LET'S TAKE IT

I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

35:13.733 --> 35:15.067
>> AN ASS.

35:15.067 --> 35:16.300
>> THAT'S A POLITE WAY OF

35:16.300 --> 35:17.067
PUTTING IT.

35:17.067 --> 35:18.233
>> OKAY.

35:18.233 --> 35:19.233
SO YOU'VE GOTTEN OVER THINKING

SINCE WE MET, YOU'VE CALLED ALL

35:34.067 --> 35:35.067
THE SHOTS.

35:35.067 --> 35:36.533
YOU DECIDED WHEN WE WERE GONNA

35:36.533 --> 35:37.233
START DATING.

35:37.233 --> 35:38.233
OUR PLANS REVOLVE AROUND YOUR

35:38.233 --> 35:39.067
SCHEDULE.

35:39.067 --> 35:40.600
YOU WANTED TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.467

35:43.233 --> 35:45.067
AND I AM SURPRISED THAT I AM

35:45.067 --> 35:48.433
REACTING THIS WAY, BUT IT MUST

35:48.433 --> 35:54.133
MEAN I REALLY LIKE YOU.

35:54.133 --> 35:55.133
BUT I'VE BEEN FRUSTRATED,

35:55.133 --> 35:58.633
BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE YOU HAVE

35:58.633 --> 36:01.467
ALL THE POWER.

I'M SORRY.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.067

BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE WHERE I

36:13.467 --> 36:14.633
AM.

36:14.633 --> 36:15.467
BECAUSE OF WHAT I WENT THROUGH

36:15.467 --> 36:18.833
WITH VICTOR, I'M STILL GUN-SHY.

36:18.833 --> 36:19.867

36:21.200 --> 36:22.300
I THOUGHT I FOUND THE LOVE OF MY

POWER HERE TOO.

36:32.467 --> 36:34.067
I COULD JUST WALK AWAY.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.067

36:35.067 --> 36:36.400
YOU DON'T.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.900
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOPE,

36:38.900 --> 36:41.433
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
