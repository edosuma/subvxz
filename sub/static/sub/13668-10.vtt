WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:01.760
Shirley, open the cabinet.

00:01.760 --> 00:02.560
Can it wait?

00:02.560 --> 00:03.880
Can it wait?

00:03.880 --> 00:05.800
Previously on St Elsewhere...

00:05.800 --> 00:07.880
Someone at St Eligius
is about to be brought up

00:07.880 --> 00:11.200
on charges for the improper
dispensing of controlled drugs.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.320
I like the person underneath,
the natural you.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.040
Ta-dah!

00:17.040 --> 00:20.520
A transfer from the St Gregory ER.
He arrested on the way over.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.200
Tonight on St Elsewhere...

00:22.200 --> 00:23.520
When they found out he couldn't pay,

00:23.520 --> 00:25.960
When they found out he couldn't pay,

00:25.960 --> 00:27.480
I'm no good for you.

00:27.480 --> 00:28.800
No, that's not true.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.840
No. Honey...

00:31.840 --> 00:32.880
No!

00:32.880 --> 00:35.560
Are you trying to tell me that
a machine can diagnose

00:35.560 --> 00:36.600
as well as man?

00:36.600 --> 00:38.200
Clearly, the machine is superior.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.240
Watch this.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.720
I just broke into your computer.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.720
Dr Morrison, there is something
wrong with me. Don't touch me.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.720
I'm not going to hurt you.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.280
We've got a code in progress here!

02:39.280 --> 02:43.280
Bring him this way.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.960
Move out.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.400
Transferred from the St Gregory ER.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.560
Chronic lung disease

02:50.560 --> 02:52.280
and congestive heart failure.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.560
He arrested on the way over.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.840
Yeah, we got the call.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.320
They said he was stable!

02:56.320 --> 02:57.720
Steve!

02:57.720 --> 02:59.680
When did he stop breathing?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.440
A few minutes ago.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.520
He threw up

03:02.520 --> 03:05.000
and started asphyxiating.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.160
They gave him Valium

03:06.160 --> 03:07.520
and transferred him like this?

03:07.520 --> 03:10.200
I want two amps of bicarb
and one of epi.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.280
Plus, a lidocaine drip,

03:12.280 --> 03:15.000
200 milligrams, 500 ccs of D5W.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.160
I'm going to defibrillate.

03:17.160 --> 03:21.160
OK.

03:24.760 --> 03:28.760
Ready.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.120
Ready.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.440
OK, clear.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.120
I'm going to go again.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.000
Ready.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.240
Clear.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.880
We've got a normal sinus rhythm.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.000
Great.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.920
All right.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.280
And a good pulse.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.280
Let's get him up to ICU.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.000
Unbelievable giving Valium
to a chronic lunger.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.920
No wonder he stopped breathing.
Who OK'd the transfer?

03:57.920 --> 04:00.320
No wonder he stopped breathing.
Who OK'd the transfer?

04:00.320 --> 04:02.640
What else did he say,
they didn't have any free beds?

04:02.640 --> 04:04.440
No, he was straight with me.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.720
He told me Mr Simmon here
has no insurance.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.760
If you don't have money,
don't get sick.

04:08.760 --> 04:12.160
Who was the doctor you talked to?

04:12.160 --> 04:13.760
Christopher Rant.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.600
Do me a favour
and follow them up to ICU,

04:15.600 --> 04:19.000
make sure he gets on the respirator,
OK? I'll call this guy Rant.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.519
Transferring an unstable patient
because he is indigent

04:21.519 --> 04:24.880
is criminally negligent.

04:24.880 --> 04:28.800
OK, there you go. Oops.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.560
I appreciate this, Helen.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.120
Any time.

04:32.120 --> 04:36.120
Hi, Jack. Hi, Pete.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.960
Guess he must be pretty upset
about Eve Leighton.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.080
Well, everybody is.
It is a damn shame.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.440
So, you wanted to see me?

04:44.440 --> 04:48.440
Yes, I do. Come on back here.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.840
Sit down, Shirley.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.240
Uh-oh.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.880
You look just like Mrs Bratts.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.680
I don't follow.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.400
A teacher of mine at nursing school.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.760
Yelled at me for sloppy corners
in Bedmaking 101.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.240
No, no.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.880
This is about the entrapment case.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.440
Don't tell me I've got to meet
with those lawyers again.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.640
Shirley, there was a meeting
this morning of all the head nurses.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.120
We feel very strongly
that you shouldn't have released

05:16.120 --> 05:18.840
those drugs to Dr White
without a prescription.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.200
That violates a basic rule.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.240
Come on, Helen,

05:21.240 --> 05:22.920
everyone does it once in a while.
Look,

05:22.920 --> 05:24.520
I explained it in my report.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.560
Fiscus and I were treating
a burn patient.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.280
OK, OK, you don't have to tell me
how hectic life is in ER.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.560
In fact, maybe you need to change
for a while till this blows over.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.600
What are you saying?

05:34.600 --> 05:36.600
I'd like you to come up
and work on this floor.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.000
Sure, so you can keep an eye on me.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.960
I think it's up to the nurses
to police our own activities.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.680
We don't want anyone to think we're
covering anything over.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.800
I get it. I'm being punished so you
look good with the administration.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.360
Now wait a minute,
this is for your own good.

05:50.360 --> 05:54.360
Well, I think it stinks.

05:56.240 --> 06:00.240
PIANO MUSIC

06:10.240 --> 06:13.240
There's a great line coming up.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.720
(BOTH LAUGH)

06:16.720 --> 06:18.800
Victor, this was a fantastic idea.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.720
Well, you said you didn't want
to go anywhere noisy.

06:21.720 --> 06:22.880
Shh!

06:22.880 --> 06:24.960
Sorry.

06:24.960 --> 06:28.960
Here.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.400
Oh, my gosh!

06:32.400 --> 06:33.080
I'll get another.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.160
I'll get another.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.200
Dr Weiss doesn't want me
eating junk food anyway,

06:37.200 --> 06:40.120
he thinks that the sugar is playing
ping-pong with my libido.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.400
Weiss!

06:41.400 --> 06:42.840
Shh!

06:42.840 --> 06:45.560
What's to hear?

06:45.560 --> 06:47.840
So, uh...

06:47.840 --> 06:51.280
did Weiss, uh, say anything
about the other evening?

06:51.280 --> 06:54.720
You mean, when we found you naked
in my apartment?

06:54.720 --> 06:56.800
Not so loud, OK?

06:56.800 --> 07:00.360
He said it showed your heart
was in the right place.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.320
What do you think?

07:02.320 --> 07:05.040
I think you are the most unusual man
I have ever met.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.080
You're kidding?

07:06.080 --> 07:06.920
Uh-uh.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.960
Uh-uh.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.120
Oh, much more.

07:09.120 --> 07:09.800
How much?

07:09.800 --> 07:10.880
How much?

07:10.880 --> 07:13.120
I've got to tell you something,

07:13.120 --> 07:16.400
I have never been as comfortable
with a woman as beautiful as you.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.000
Victor.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.280
Really, you are the most
extraordinary person

07:20.280 --> 07:22.160
in the whole world.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.920
Except for... I don't know,
Albert Schweitzer, maybe.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.720
But he's dead.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.720
What do you, uh...what do want to do
when the film is over?

07:32.680 --> 07:36.400
It is over.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.880
Of course.

07:37.880 --> 07:41.880
Do you want to go for a late-night
dinner, a stroll in the park,

07:42.280 --> 07:45.720
a rum and toddy at the Ritz?

07:45.720 --> 07:49.680
Well, I thought maybe we could stay
for the second feature.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.080
I was hoping you'd say that.

07:53.080 --> 07:57.080
PIANO MUSIC

08:20.560 --> 08:24.560
You keep a diary?

08:25.040 --> 08:29.040
It goes back, um, almost a year
to before all this started.

08:34.720 --> 08:38.720
I miss them. So much.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.240
Have you had any more headaches?

08:43.240 --> 08:45.120
Not since I checked in last night.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.640
I'm afraid your test results
have been much help.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.400
Your blood sugar is a little low,

08:50.400 --> 08:52.120
that might explain
your food cravings.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.760
We are still waiting for
the special chemistries and...

08:54.760 --> 08:57.320
Dr Morrison,
there is something wrong with me!

08:57.320 --> 08:59.960
It is a little early to figure out
if there's a connection

08:59.960 --> 09:01.160
between your migraines

09:01.160 --> 09:03.920
and the erratic changes
in your behaviour.

09:03.920 --> 09:07.920
When the pain gets bad,
I go just...insane.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.680
And if you can't find out
what's wrong,

09:11.680 --> 09:13.880
I'm never going to get
my family back.

09:13.880 --> 09:17.880
Do they know you checked in?

09:19.480 --> 09:22.720
My husband took the kids
a couple of weeks ago

09:22.720 --> 09:24.080
and went to his mother's house.

09:24.080 --> 09:28.080
My first Christmas alone.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.960
I can't blame them, actually,
I drove them away!

09:31.960 --> 09:34.880
I get these attacks,
or whatever they are, and I...

09:34.880 --> 09:37.440
I'm dangerous to everybody,
including myself.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.920
And I can't seem to stop.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.920
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.760
Morning, Dr Westphall.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.360
Hello, Ehrlich. Thank you.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.480
I'll get that one, too.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.520
Thanks again.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.120
Dr Westphall, do you have a minute?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.520
Sure, just let me get a newspaper.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.360
Never mind, I shouldn't bug you
this early.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.800
I just want to get a paper.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.800
Hi, Nancy.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.680
Now...

10:19.680 --> 10:20.720
What's up?

10:20.720 --> 10:23.480
I can handle it myself, I know
you've got a lot to worry about.

10:23.480 --> 10:24.960
Ehrlich, let me to you something,

10:24.960 --> 10:27.720
I already went through this today.
It took my daughter 20 minutes

10:27.720 --> 10:29.680
to tell me our washing machine
doesn't work.

10:29.680 --> 10:32.560
I'm not going to spend another
20 minutes second guessing you, OK?

10:32.560 --> 10:33.800
What is it?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.600
I feel sort of silly, really.

10:36.600 --> 10:40.600
There's this, uh...

10:42.280 --> 10:43.480
You see, there's this girl.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.680
Girl, a woman.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.720
And I think...

10:47.720 --> 10:48.760
I think I'm, uh...

10:48.760 --> 10:50.000
In love.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.280
Does it really show?

10:51.280 --> 10:53.040
I think I want to get married.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.200
Congratulations.

10:54.200 --> 10:54.920
You think it's a good idea?

10:54.920 --> 10:57.320
You think it's a good idea?

10:57.320 --> 10:59.400
Neither do I.
That's why I need your advice.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.840
No, what I'm trying to tell you
is that I don't know the girl.

11:02.840 --> 11:06.680
Believe me, Dr Westphall, we're
talking major league sweetheart,

11:06.680 --> 11:08.640
the kind of girl
they write Valentines about.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.760
This isn't your average
houndstooth cocktail.

11:10.760 --> 11:11.880
Sounds terrific.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.000
But do I want to get married?
I am a first-year resident.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.920
I've got more pressures and
responsibilities than I can handle.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.080
Which isn't to say
she wouldn't help me, she would.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.000
That's the kind of girl she is.
What's wrong with being single?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.720
Do we really have to get married?

11:24.720 --> 11:27.800
Can't we share our lives together
without some flimsy piece of paper

11:27.800 --> 11:28.960
as a bond?

11:28.960 --> 11:30.640
You present a strong argument.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.840
Darn it, you're right,
I'm going to ask her.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.960
Thank you, Dr Westphall,
I appreciate your help.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.680
Just invite me to the wedding.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.400
Wedding?

11:39.400 --> 11:43.400
Oh, boy!

11:49.520 --> 11:50.960
God, I'm really sorry.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.000
Sorry.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.640
No, it's my fault.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.360
Are you writing another book?

11:57.360 --> 12:00.760
No, I'm not that crazy.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.560
That's great, thank you.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.720
I guess you saw the tests
on Janet Dalton.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.960
Yeah, I did.
It's a puzzle, isn't it?

12:06.960 --> 12:09.640
I thought for sure we'd see
something in the hormonal studies.

12:09.640 --> 12:13.640
Well, she seems so nice, could it
be some form of schizophrenia?

12:13.680 --> 12:16.640
I mean, she totally flips out
and then comes all the way back.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.360
I can spot a schizo in a second.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.520
The truth is...
I'd like to see a CAT scan.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.600
The migraines
could have an organic basis.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.200
OK.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.280
But I am wondering if she might
unconsciously be trying to invent

12:28.280 --> 12:31.520
some physical excuse for the fact
that her marriage is breaking up.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.600
I had a talk with her.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.000
I'm sure we can rule that out.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.240
She did mention, though,
that she was getting her period.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.920
I wonder, could you recheck
the serums LH, FSH and...

12:42.920 --> 12:44.200
What's that other one?

12:44.200 --> 12:44.880
Oestrogen levels.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.240
Oestrogen levels.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.920
You know,
I think we should trade jobs.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.920
No, I am only good at suggestions.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.160
I appreciate all the help I can get.

12:53.160 --> 12:56.080
Don't give me any excuses,
Christmas is over.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.080
It's time to take this junk down.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.600
This place is a fire trap,
for crying out loud.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.600
One spark and this stuff
goes up like that.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.640
&lt; Hi, Mark.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.320
In my home, the tree comes in
on the 24th and it goes out

13:06.320 --> 13:07.480
on the 26th.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.880
Otherwise, the needles start falling
down and you're tracking them

13:10.880 --> 13:12.000
all over the house.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.040
Bye, Mark.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.760
The holidays are over
for Pete's sake.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.240
So, how are we doing here? Any luck?

13:17.240 --> 13:21.160
Well, I think Mr Medwood's records
have fallen into the black hole.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.760
Oh, now this is kind of neat.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.120
It looks like Arabic.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.200
I tell you what,

13:25.200 --> 13:28.320
why don't you call Walter Lankau
over at Efficiency Systems.

13:28.320 --> 13:32.320
I've been on the phone with him so
much people are beginning to talk.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.800
Yes, this is... OK, I'll hold.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.080
Like I have a choice.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.440
How's tricks?

13:43.440 --> 13:46.040
Oh, working up here is a scream.
I never should have released

13:46.040 --> 13:48.040
those drugs to White
without a prescription.

13:48.040 --> 13:51.000
Come on, it's not that bad.
You'll be back in ER in no time.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.040
Rosenthal barely lets me
get near patients.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.560
The biggest problem I had
all morning was a 97-year-old man

13:55.560 --> 13:56.600
with hiccups.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.280
So, how did you get him to stop?

13:58.280 --> 13:59.640
I didn't, he died.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.880
Yes, finally! This is Nurse Daniels
over at St Eligius.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.480
This is Dr Cavanero.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.720
When Dr Rant does decide to come in,
would you please ask him to call me?

14:07.720 --> 14:08.840
And me, and me.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.800
Or Dr Fiscus.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.680
What does Joan think?

14:12.680 --> 14:14.600
I want to surprise her.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.600
Cover it up again.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.360
You're right, lose it.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.440
You know, I had a girlfriend once
who had a moustache.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.640
I hated it.
It made her look older than me.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.520
You know, Fiscus, it's scary
to think you took care of me in ER.

14:32.520 --> 14:36.520
Morning, guys, how you doing?

14:43.280 --> 14:44.840
What are you doing, Fiscus?

14:44.840 --> 14:47.440
Ehrlich, who is your designer,
Calvin Swine?

14:47.440 --> 14:48.920
What did you say, Fiscus?

14:48.920 --> 14:52.920
Don't get mad at me, have you seen
the back of your jacket?

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
You have got to be kidding me!

14:58.120 --> 15:00.880
That's very original.
They didn't even spell Ehrlich right!

15:00.880 --> 15:02.240
This is not funny!
Whoever is doing this,

15:02.240 --> 15:03.560
This is not funny!
Whoever is doing this,

15:03.560 --> 15:06.600
Enough is enough,
I am not an animal, I am a man!

15:06.600 --> 15:10.600
And if anybody here agrees
with that, please oink.

15:10.680 --> 15:14.680
You better move, Fiscus.

15:16.360 --> 15:20.360
Dr Kiley, what about Mr Dilleo's
consult from Cardiology?

15:20.480 --> 15:23.400
Because of his history of TIAs
and the left carotid...

15:23.400 --> 15:25.040
So, when's the big day?

15:25.040 --> 15:27.520
I don't know.
I told you, I haven't asked her yet.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.480
I am hoping we'll see noticeable
improvement in Mr Dilleo's condition

15:31.480 --> 15:35.480
over the next 24 hours.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.040
I didn't know you were
working today.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.800
Victor. I traded with Jenny so
I could have Friday off, remember?

15:41.800 --> 15:45.280
That's right, I promised
to take you to see that play.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.320
Right, The Overcoat.
I hear it's wonderful.

15:47.320 --> 15:51.320
Listening, Roberta, I know this
isn't the most romantic place.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.280
Whenever I pictured
myself asking you...

15:54.280 --> 15:55.520
Victor, they're leaving without you.

15:55.520 --> 15:59.520
Victor, they're leaving without you.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.720
Dr Wade, for those of us
who are still present,

16:05.720 --> 16:09.720
would you like to fill us in
on the Brody case?

16:09.920 --> 16:12.000
'20-year-old male,
presented late yesterday,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.760
'complaining
of severe abdominal pain.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.160
'His white blood count was 18,500.'

16:17.160 --> 16:20.240
Excuse me! Oh!

16:20.240 --> 16:24.240
Pardon me!

16:26.240 --> 16:27.360
Pardon me!

16:27.360 --> 16:31.360
'Dr Stubbs called me
in for a surgery consult.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.280
'The abdominal obstruction series
showed....'

16:34.280 --> 16:38.280
Excuse me, pardon me!

16:39.240 --> 16:41.280
..and found that the patient
had suffered

16:41.280 --> 16:45.280
a small bowel perforation
in the right lower quadrant.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.600
I hope we didn't inconvenience you,
Ehrlich.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.760
We resected the cecum
and several...

16:51.760 --> 16:52.920
Wow!

16:52.920 --> 16:55.520
It won't be long before the computer
is as common in every home

16:55.520 --> 16:56.640
as a phone or television.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.080
Can I use it for bookmaking?

16:58.080 --> 16:59.240
Bookkeeping, sure.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.360
No, bookmaking.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.000
Good morning.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.440
Bonwit, back into bed.
Matthew, I'm Dr Craig.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.920
What is all this crap?

17:07.920 --> 17:10.520
I didn't tell you, Mr Brody
made his own diagnosis

17:10.520 --> 17:13.640
using self-help medical software
on his home computer.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.960
He thought all he had
was simple gastroenteritis.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.839
Well, it takes all kinds,
doesn't it?

17:18.839 --> 17:21.480
I'm a student at MIT,
studying Computer Science.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.599
This medical software
is part of a class project.

17:23.599 --> 17:24.640
I helped design it.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.160
Dr Wade.

17:27.160 --> 17:30.360
Dr Wade here has done
a very fine diagnosis.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.560
As you all probably know by now,

17:32.560 --> 17:35.000
a bowel perforation can be
difficult to pinpoint.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.960
And you, young man,
I hope you have learned a lesson.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.640
Leave medical care
to the professionals.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.480
Actually, Dr Craig,
most common ailments

17:42.480 --> 17:44.120
don't even require
a doctor's attention.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.320
don't even require
a doctor's attention.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.920
Yeah, well, if you had managed this
at home much longer,

17:48.920 --> 17:50.400
it could've become very serious.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.440
The computer gave
the correct diagnosis.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.440
If I had paid closer attention
to the readout,

17:54.440 --> 17:55.800
I'd have been here much sooner.

17:55.800 --> 17:59.400
BEEPING

17:59.400 --> 18:03.240
Are you trying to tell me that a
machine can diagnose as well as man?

18:03.240 --> 18:05.840
No. Clearly,
the machine is superior.

18:05.840 --> 18:09.120
Compared with any of you doctors,
it has a better memory,

18:09.120 --> 18:11.600
clearer logic and, best of all,
lower fees.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.640
And do you expect it to operate
on you, too?

18:14.640 --> 18:17.200
Mr Bonwit, are you ready
for the big day tomorrow?

18:17.200 --> 18:21.200
Well, I think my diverticulitis
can be treated with antibiotics.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.040
Antibiotics are not
the preferred treatment.

18:24.040 --> 18:27.440
Yes, well, I figure that since
my temperature is stable

18:27.440 --> 18:28.760
and I have no problems with...

18:28.760 --> 18:30.200
Brody!

18:30.200 --> 18:32.560
What have you been feeding
Mr Bonwit?

18:32.560 --> 18:34.520
He wanted to see how it worked.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.880
If I ever catch you diagnosing
patients around here again,

18:37.880 --> 18:40.320
I'll have you arrested
for practicing medicine

18:40.320 --> 18:43.480
without a licence,
do you understand?

18:43.480 --> 18:45.520
Then we'll see what fun you have
playing Pac-Man

18:45.520 --> 18:47.960
inside a prison cell.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.880
Mr Bonwit, we will stop
back at the end of rounds.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.880
Perhaps then you will come
to your senses.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.720
I finally got a hold of Rant
at St Gregory's.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.000
He gave me the usual song and dance.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.600
I told him I was really tempted
to file charges.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.000
Is there someone in the family
pushing you to do this?

19:07.000 --> 19:10.880
What family? I haven't found one.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.880
Anyhow, I don't see what the problem
is, it happens all the time.

19:15.600 --> 19:19.000
I guess after three years,
I'm just sick and tired of it.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.600
What do you mean
that this happens all the time?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.480
It's a sort of unspoken tradition.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.400
We are a public facility.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.200
Private hospitals dump
their unwanted patients

19:29.200 --> 19:32.960
on our doorstep every day.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.880
But this time, Mr Simmon may
die as a result of their lack

19:35.880 --> 19:36.920
of responsibility.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.240
And St Eligius is potentially liable
if he does.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.840
I mean, Dr Fiscus did accept
the transfer over the phone.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.840
I just think something
should be done.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.200
I can't promise anything,

19:45.200 --> 19:47.640
but I'll call Henry Judson
over at St Gregory's.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.560
I'd like to talk to him myself.

19:49.560 --> 19:53.560
Leave it alone, Annie,
it's out of your hands.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.600
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

20:03.600 --> 20:04.760
Dr Ridley.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.360
Hi. I was just walking down the hall
and thought I would come in

20:07.360 --> 20:08.480
and say hello.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.560
I'm glad you did.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.920
Are you going to finish your toast?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.880
No.

20:13.880 --> 20:14.920
Thanks.

20:14.920 --> 20:18.000
I haven't eaten yet.
What are you reading?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.800
My diary.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.080
Oh.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.920
Keeping a diary is a great idea.

20:22.920 --> 20:26.520
It gives you a chance to get
a perspective on your life.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.320
At this point, it's my only
connection with Brian and the kids.

20:29.320 --> 20:33.280
You know? I was wondering
about your last pregnancy.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.360
We don't have any
of the charts here.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.400
It was a C-section.

20:36.400 --> 20:40.240
Was there anything unusual?
Any special medication or problems?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.360
There was a lot of morning sickness
this time.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.600
I didn't have any with Roger.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.200
I wonder...

20:47.200 --> 20:50.640
I wonder if there is anything
in the diary that could help us.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.760
I can't imagine.

20:51.760 --> 20:55.760
You know, diagnoses
is a very peculiar art form.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.840
You just never know
when you're going to get a tipoff.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.040
If there is anything in there
you don't want me to read,

21:03.040 --> 21:07.040
then you just rip it out.

21:10.680 --> 21:13.480
Anything, if it could help.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.400
Thank you very much.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.400
I'll have you out of here
in no time.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.240
Everything is going to be fine.
Would you wait over here?

21:26.240 --> 21:28.520
Annie.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.880
Dr Christopher Rant,
this Dr Annie Cavanero.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.920
Chris transferred Mr Simmon to us
last night from St Greg's.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.240
Hi.

21:35.240 --> 21:39.240
Um... I have already given him
my nickel's worth.

21:40.840 --> 21:44.480
I thought I would try and give you
an idea of what went on last night.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.480
Yeah, I really don't have the time.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.400
Yeah, I really don't have the time.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.840
Maybe if you had given
Mr Simmons five minutes

21:49.840 --> 21:52.560
of thought last night,
his life wouldn't be in danger now.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.960
Are you serious about bringing me
up on charges?

21:54.960 --> 21:56.000
You're damn right!

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
Before you do, would you at least
give me a chance to explain?

22:16.640 --> 22:20.640
Well, here goes.

22:26.680 --> 22:30.680
Nah!

22:31.400 --> 22:35.400
Just do it.

22:41.920 --> 22:45.920
Can't stop now.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.120
The attending insisted
I give him the Valium.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.600
I knew it was just buying time.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.720
Buying time for his heart failure.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.760
That is probably what threw him
into cardio respiratory arrest.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.080
You think I wanted to send him
out like that?

22:59.080 --> 23:01.680
You think I wanted to send him
out like that?

23:01.680 --> 23:02.800
Why didn't you admit him?

23:02.800 --> 23:06.600
I don't have admission privileges,
I am just moonlighting there.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.640
You couldn't find someone
to do it for you?

23:08.640 --> 23:10.840
As soon as they found out
he couldn't pay,

23:10.840 --> 23:13.720
they told me
he was stable enough to ship out.

23:13.720 --> 23:16.120
Because the hospital doesn't want
to eat an ICU bill.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.320
If the on-call doctor says transfer,

23:18.320 --> 23:20.240
the hospital doesn't ask twice,
right?

23:20.240 --> 23:22.400
I figured if he could last the ride,

23:22.400 --> 23:25.120
he'd be better off someplace else.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.920
Believe me, I didn't get
into medicine to kill people.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.400
I feel terrible about this.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.680
How long have you been
moonlighting at St Gregory's?

23:32.680 --> 23:34.120
About a year.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.240
I am an ortho resident
at Boston General.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.440
You do this a lot?

23:37.440 --> 23:38.480
A couple times a month.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.000
I need the extra money
to pay off my loans.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.320
And I like the diversity.

23:42.320 --> 23:46.320
It sounds like maybe this got
a little too diverse.

23:47.440 --> 23:51.440
'3242. Dr Caldwell. 3242.'

23:54.640 --> 23:57.520
This is Caldwell.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.720
Yeah, how close to the eye is it?

23:59.720 --> 24:03.720
OK, I will be right down.

24:07.040 --> 24:11.040
Wonderful.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.200
What are you staring at?

24:30.200 --> 24:34.200
You think I'm crazy.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.320
Ehrlich, I'm not Roberta's keeper.
If you ask me one more time...

24:38.320 --> 24:40.880
Give me a break, Shirley.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.440
Try Geriatrics.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.960
BUZZING

24:44.960 --> 24:48.480
Billie, would you check
on Mrs Connell in 3320?

24:48.480 --> 24:51.280
She just buzzed.

24:51.280 --> 24:55.280
Third floor. &gt;

24:59.960 --> 25:03.120
Leave it! I made the mess, I'll clean
it up, just leave it alone!

25:03.120 --> 25:05.080
Did you want something,
Mrs Connell?

25:05.080 --> 25:07.640
Yeah, she wants to tell you how
scared she is.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.960
She's afraid I'm going to hurt her,
right, Mrs Connell?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.240
Everything is going to be OK.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.960
Nobody needs you.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.640
Don't touch me. Stay away.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.640
I'm not going to hurt you.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.200
Dr Ridley.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.440
Uh-huh.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.720
I am Brian Dalton, Janet's husband.

25:32.720 --> 25:35.280
Oh, yeah, of course.

25:35.280 --> 25:39.280
I'm glad you could stop by.
Come on in.

25:45.880 --> 25:48.760
Um...
I know these don't look so great,

25:48.760 --> 25:52.720
but what do you expect for Boston
in the winter time, right?

25:52.720 --> 25:54.320
Would you like one?

25:54.320 --> 25:58.320
No. Thanks.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.600
Janet called me the other day,
said she was coming here.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.160
But I didn't believe her.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.240
Why not?

26:05.240 --> 26:07.000
Cos she has lied to me
so much before.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.200
She is in a lot of pain.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.520
No kidding.

26:12.520 --> 26:16.320
I am through with it, Dr Ridley.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.440
Do you mind?

26:17.440 --> 26:19.640
No.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.040
Here.

26:22.040 --> 26:26.040
I can't believe that this is
the same woman I fell so hard for.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.520
That I used to love.

26:30.520 --> 26:34.440
She tells me that you took
the children and went to live

26:34.440 --> 26:36.760
with your mother just a few weeks
before Christmas?

26:36.760 --> 26:39.880
I couldn't keep pretending
to the kids she was OK.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.720
She becomes so irrational.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.360
It seemed like every month
it was something.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.560
She wrote about a lot
of this in her diary.

26:46.560 --> 26:49.600
Arguments with people in the street,
screaming and yelling.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.720
She seems like such a gentle person.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.840
And then just a little while ago,
she was involved in a small incident.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.640
Did she hurt anyone?

26:57.640 --> 26:59.760
No. Scared a few people,
but nobody got hurt.

26:59.760 --> 27:03.760
It's not always violent.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.880
One time she wanted to bake cookies,
but found there wasn't enough flour.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.960
Next thing I know, she is
on the floor bawling like a baby.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.960
I tried everything,
I even ran out to buy more flour,

27:15.960 --> 27:19.960
but nothing worked.
She cried for almost two hours.

27:20.080 --> 27:23.320
I watched her tear this family
apart for a year now.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.360
I couldn't take it anymore
and neither could the kids.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.360
She needs help, Doctor.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.240
I hope you can give it to her.

27:30.240 --> 27:34.240
Well, I can tell you one thing.

27:35.160 --> 27:39.160
She loves you very much,
and the children.

27:40.040 --> 27:44.040
And that's why she is here.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.960
You are real lucky, pal.
Your eye is fine.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.200
There won't be any dysfunction
of the eyelid.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.560
Damn dog!

27:51.560 --> 27:54.280
Ain't there some health law
against him being in here?

27:54.280 --> 27:55.920
The dog could freeze outside.

27:55.920 --> 27:56.960
I meant the cop.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.680
Why did he bite you?

27:58.680 --> 28:00.040
I mean the dog.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.480
Let me guess,

28:01.480 --> 28:03.840
you were just standing around,
minding your business.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.800
For a guy without half a moustache,
you got a pretty smart mouth.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.920
We like to think of him
as a guy WITH half as moustache.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.640
Fiscus, do you want
to finish up here?

28:11.640 --> 28:15.640
Sure.

28:17.400 --> 28:21.400
Why do you always call me
for these sleaze balls?

28:25.720 --> 28:28.200
Well, hiya, Victor.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.480
Hi, Dr. Caldwell.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.000
Oh, what a beautiful dog.
Hello, there, mister...

28:33.000 --> 28:36.280
(BARKS)

28:36.280 --> 28:38.800
Wayne, have you seen Roberta?

28:38.800 --> 28:40.120
Maybe she is at my place.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.000
No, she is allergic to mould.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
I think I saw her
heading for Paediatrics.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.440
Whoa, boy.

28:48.440 --> 28:51.280
OK, Dr Kochar,
without revealing the ailment

28:51.280 --> 28:53.320
of the anonymous patient,
chosen at random,

28:53.320 --> 28:55.200
may I have the first symptom,
please?

28:55.200 --> 28:58.800
Yes. A sharp pain in the chest
increased with respiration.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.480
That's easy, a heart attack.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.520
Now, just a minute.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.040
Mr Bonwit, do you mind?

29:03.040 --> 29:06.600
Is the pain crushing and and-or
does it radiate from the centre

29:06.600 --> 29:09.160
of the chest to the jaw,
neck or arms?

29:09.160 --> 29:10.720
Uh... No.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.440
Dr Craig,
this is a most wonderful invention.

29:13.440 --> 29:16.280
Oh, and that means a lot
coming from you Kochar,

29:16.280 --> 29:19.280
you're still marvelling
at indoor plumbing.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.320
Are you short of breath?

29:21.320 --> 29:24.360
Uh...yes.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.400
OK.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.720
Have you recently had an operation,
injury or illness

29:27.720 --> 29:29.120
that has kept you in bed?

29:29.120 --> 29:31.840
Does my wife count?

29:31.840 --> 29:33.040
There is nothing here.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.320
Tell me something,

29:34.320 --> 29:37.800
if all the doctors are to rely
on this for their answers instead

29:37.800 --> 29:41.400
of using their head, what happens
when the electricity goes off?

29:41.400 --> 29:42.640
Port-a-pack batteries.

29:42.640 --> 29:46.200
These guys have an answer
for everything.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.600
Do you have a fever 100 degrees
or above?

29:48.600 --> 29:50.480
Uh...no.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.200
And besides, what about
a doctor's personal touch?

29:53.200 --> 29:55.880
His warmth,
his caring about his patients?

29:55.880 --> 29:57.680
Can your machine provide that?

29:57.680 --> 29:58.720
Little nerd!

29:58.720 --> 30:00.880
Here,
I got the computer's diagnosis.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.800
It says,
"Call physician immediately.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.200
"You may have a collapsed lung.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.720
"For more information,
see pneumothorax."

30:06.720 --> 30:08.560
Dr Kochar, will you verify

30:08.560 --> 30:11.400
that I have not previously seen
the doctor's diagnosis?

30:11.400 --> 30:12.760
Yes, I can, Matthew.

30:12.760 --> 30:16.760
Would you now tell us
his actual diagnosis, please?

30:19.880 --> 30:23.880
Pneumothorax.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.960
Kochar, don't you have
anything better to do?

30:31.960 --> 30:35.960
Yes, sir.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.120
As I told you over the phone,

30:41.120 --> 30:44.640
our position at St Gregory's
is firm.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.240
In Mr Simmon's case,
we followed accepted policy

30:47.240 --> 30:48.640
for the disposition of patients

30:48.640 --> 30:51.360
who present
without third-party authorization.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.800
You mean patients without insurance.

30:53.800 --> 30:57.360
Mr Simmon was transferred
in complete accordance

30:57.360 --> 30:58.840
with our best medical judgment.

30:58.840 --> 31:02.160
Come on, Henry, you know
the man won't last the night,

31:02.160 --> 31:04.040
any med student could tell you that.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.360
The city of Boston
doesn't subsidize our budget.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.680
We are self supporting.

31:09.680 --> 31:13.040
Therefore, St Gregory's
must be run like a business.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.840
A bankrupt hospital isn't going
to be taking care of any patients,

31:15.840 --> 31:17.120
indigent or otherwise.

31:17.120 --> 31:21.120
It is not a question of money,
it is a question of abandonment.

31:22.040 --> 31:26.040
Now, I hardly think
that's the way to look at it.

31:26.080 --> 31:30.080
Mr Judson, didn't your hospital
just complete a new wing?

31:32.080 --> 31:34.320
Cardiac care. But I don't see...

31:34.320 --> 31:37.320
Weren't you subsidized by the
Government to the Hill-Burton Act?

31:37.320 --> 31:41.320
The construction was partially
financed in that way, yes.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.840
Well, then you are aware
that St Gregory's is required

31:44.840 --> 31:48.480
to provide a certain amount of
medical care to the needy in return.

31:48.480 --> 31:52.480
Ms Halloran, we meet our quotas.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.840
I am going to find
that out for myself.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.040
I am recommending
to the Department of Health

31:58.040 --> 32:00.560
And Human Services that they
launch an investigation.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.120
Toward what end?

32:02.120 --> 32:05.000
Cut off funds, charges,

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
removal of the present
board of directors, possibly.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
Ms Halloran, I don't see
what you expect us to do.

32:12.200 --> 32:15.720
I expect you to be in my office
tomorrow morning at nine o'clock

32:15.720 --> 32:17.800
with the pertinent figures.

32:17.800 --> 32:21.800
And if things don't jibe,
all hell is going to break loose.

32:25.400 --> 32:29.400
All right.

32:29.480 --> 32:33.480
Daniel.

32:36.040 --> 32:40.040
You know, I am getting to enjoy
being on your side, Joan.

32:51.160 --> 32:55.160
'Dr Lee to Oncology,
Dr Lee to Oncology.'

32:56.440 --> 32:57.840
Back again to cover your tracks?

32:57.840 --> 32:59.840
I came back to see how he was doing.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.800
Mr Simmon died.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.560
I'm sorry.

33:03.560 --> 33:06.920
I finally located a cousin
of his in Mattapoisett.

33:06.920 --> 33:10.920
But you know what?
She didn't even care.

33:10.920 --> 33:14.440
My supervisor over at Boston General
found out about this.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.160
She said I'd be kicked
out of their residents programme

33:17.160 --> 33:19.280
if I keep moonlighting.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.520
I suppose it's for the best.

33:20.520 --> 33:23.000
Maybe you are just not cut
out for emergency medicine.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
Yeah, I would have burned out
pretty quick anyway.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.280
I really feel rotten.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.600
That poor guy was
so alone in the world.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.200
He had nobody to complain for him.

33:34.200 --> 33:35.600
I did my good deed, I complained.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.600
What did you do?

33:37.600 --> 33:39.200
I tried to save his life!

33:39.200 --> 33:43.200
Maybe you should have tried harder.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.440
Dr. Ridley.  Yeah?

33:51.440 --> 33:54.240
Do have a second?  Sure.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.440
Janet's CAT scan was negative.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.960
OK, well, we'll just keep trying,
all right?

33:58.960 --> 34:00.520
I am on my way up to my office.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.880
I just got her postpartum
chart from the clinic.

34:02.880 --> 34:03.960
What for?

34:03.960 --> 34:07.640
I'm going to try a little
statistical plotting.

34:07.640 --> 34:11.639
All right,
keep your fingers crossed, OK?

34:14.840 --> 34:16.920
Helen, have you seen Roberta Sloan?

34:16.920 --> 34:19.400
Yeah, she's in physical therapy
right now.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.040
Anything I can do?

34:21.040 --> 34:25.040
Will you marry me?

34:30.880 --> 34:33.000
I am Dr Westphall,
Director Of Medicine,

34:33.000 --> 34:34.080
what can I do for you?

34:34.080 --> 34:38.080
Hi. Watch this.

34:38.679 --> 34:42.679
I just broke into your computer.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.360
When we installed the system
five years ago,

34:49.360 --> 34:51.040
we took precautions against this.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.320
Then your technology is
a little outdated, isn't it?

34:53.320 --> 34:55.920
Walter, this man has access
to all our records - accounting,

34:55.920 --> 34:58.480
maintenance, patient files,
you name it.

34:58.480 --> 35:01.720
Ever since the home computer boom
and that movie WarGames,

35:01.720 --> 35:03.840
it's the latest craze.

35:03.840 --> 35:07.520
Crime without ever leaving
the comfort of your own home.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.440
Matthew, this is Walter Lankao,
Efficiency Systems,

35:10.440 --> 35:12.840
the company that installed
our computer here.

35:12.840 --> 35:15.600
Hi. I'm impressed with what you're
doing with speech synthesizers.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.640
Hi. I'm impressed with what you're
doing with speech synthesizers.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.520
Can I ask you a question?  Uh-huh.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.480
Do you achieve satisfactory results
on an eight bit microprocessor

35:21.480 --> 35:22.840
by linear predictive coding?

35:22.840 --> 35:26.280
Well, when you go from pulse code
modulated speech at 64,000 bits

35:26.280 --> 35:27.440
per second down to 1,200

35:27.440 --> 35:31.200
or 1,400, it does sound strange.
Awful lot of compression there. &gt;

35:31.200 --> 35:33.600
Yeah, well, what
about reconstituting the raw code

35:33.600 --> 35:34.960
to make it recognizable again?

35:34.960 --> 35:37.440
Hm. That seems to be the way to go.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.640
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

35:38.640 --> 35:42.400
I'm sorry, Dr Westphall,
it's tough not to talk shop.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.520
Now you know what it's like
when doctors speak to patients.

35:45.520 --> 35:48.280
Matthew, can you show us how
you gained access to our system?

35:48.280 --> 35:49.920
What modifications to make?

35:49.920 --> 35:52.960
I think Dr Westphall prefers
to start with how you got in.

35:52.960 --> 35:54.960
Oh. Well, it's nothing unusual,
really.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.640
First, I got an outside line

35:56.640 --> 35:59.880
and dialled into VVC using
the Boston area code 617.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.280
Then I just dialled in
a five digit code at random.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.600
What is VVC?

36:03.600 --> 36:06.080
It is a nationwide network
owned by Vericorp.

36:06.080 --> 36:10.080
It connects over 1,200 computers and
has about 150,000 authorised users.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.320
With the number of users,

36:12.320 --> 36:15.360
the chances of getting caught
are virtually nil.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.800
By using the area code,

36:16.800 --> 36:19.200
does that mean anyone
in this country has access?

36:19.200 --> 36:21.080
Yeah.
Well, anyone in the world, really.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.720
Wonderful.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.640
Here, once I've gotten
into the computer over VVC,

36:25.640 --> 36:29.040
the way it dials back tells me
what kind of computer it is.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.680
Then this re-dialler
just keeps hitting numbers

36:31.680 --> 36:33.440
until it gets the one
I am looking for.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.440
Then, once I get that
and I break the password...

36:37.680 --> 36:40.240
I'm in.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.680
How did you break the password?

36:41.680 --> 36:44.800
Usually that is the really fun part,
but since I didn't have time,

36:44.800 --> 36:46.560
I just went straight to the harbour.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.560
That is sort of an electronic
bulletin board

36:48.560 --> 36:51.720
where hackers leave codes
and messages for other hackers.

36:51.720 --> 36:52.760
Hackers.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.480
Oh, people who play with computers
just for the thrill of it.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.760
Electronic joyriding.

36:57.760 --> 37:01.760
If Matthew got our code
off that bulletin board,

37:01.800 --> 37:04.720
that means that anyone
could have access, is that right?

37:04.720 --> 37:07.040
Yeah. It does.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.280
Oh, boy.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.760
I'm sorry, Dr Ehrlich,
this is the nurses' lounge.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.440
I'm afraid you'll have to leave.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.480
I'm sorry.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.520
Hey, I'm kidding.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.440
Ha-ha. Do you want some of this?

37:16.440 --> 37:18.560
No, I don't.

37:18.560 --> 37:19.880
Did Roberta say no?

37:19.880 --> 37:22.360
I haven't even had
the chance to ask her yet.

37:22.360 --> 37:25.120
Helen, do you get the feeling
if something is supposed to happen,

37:25.120 --> 37:26.240
it would have happened?

37:26.240 --> 37:27.520
If I am supposed to marry,

37:27.520 --> 37:29.320
I would've had the chance
to ask her by now.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.320
It doesn't sound like you, Victor.

37:31.320 --> 37:33.560
You're usually the type to go
after things, right?

37:33.560 --> 37:35.760
I am, usually. This seems different.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.480
Have you ever lived with anyone?

37:37.480 --> 37:39.160
What has that got to do with it?

37:39.160 --> 37:40.880
Well, you know, it's a big change.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.560
You live with someone day in,
day out,

37:42.560 --> 37:44.080
they start to have an effect on you.

37:44.080 --> 37:47.680
I think I could stand a little
change, a little self-improvement.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.320
That's not what I'm talking about.

37:49.320 --> 37:53.320
I mean, you know, like, what if she
starts wanting to go out at night?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.440
Movies, dancing, museums,
Tupperware parties.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.040
I like doing anything with Roberta.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.400
After you've been
on call 16 hours a day?

38:00.400 --> 38:01.920
And you're due back in eight?

38:01.920 --> 38:03.720
When will you get
your sleep, Victor?

38:03.720 --> 38:05.880
She won't ask me to go
out on nights like that.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.880
Oh, no, she may not ask,

38:07.880 --> 38:11.640
but you are not going to want
to disappoint her either.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.880
Helen, why are you doing this to me?

38:13.880 --> 38:16.040
Oh, Victor, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to upset you.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.960
But I think what I am really trying
to say is be sure you both know

38:18.960 --> 38:22.880
what you really want out of life,
it makes everything so much easier.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.960
The only way to know
if you are supposed to marry

38:24.960 --> 38:28.960
is if you're absolutely sure
you want to get married. OK?

38:34.600 --> 38:37.000
Bobby. Bobby!

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
I missed you today.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.840
Something wrong?

38:42.840 --> 38:46.200
No.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.840
Why are you acting so strange?

38:47.840 --> 38:51.520
It's nothing.

38:51.520 --> 38:54.000
Well, I have got a couple
of patients to look in on.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.040
Can you wait?

38:55.040 --> 38:58.640
I thought maybe we'd get
some dinner at Lillian's tonight.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.640
Yeah, I would love to.

39:03.920 --> 39:07.920
See you in a minute.

39:12.760 --> 39:16.760
You shaved your moustache!

39:19.400 --> 39:23.320
Hi. Have you lost weight?

39:23.320 --> 39:24.680
Jack.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.240
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

39:26.240 --> 39:30.200
I got Janet's Serum LH,
FSH and oestrogen levels.

39:30.200 --> 39:30.760
And you didn't find anything, right?

39:30.760 --> 39:31.800
And you didn't find anything, right?

39:31.800 --> 39:33.080
Cos I did.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.400
You mean, it is psychological?

39:34.400 --> 39:37.760
You mean, it is psychological?

39:37.760 --> 39:39.880
Come on!

39:39.880 --> 39:41.520
No! Look!

39:41.520 --> 39:42.760
Look at her symptoms.

39:42.760 --> 39:46.120
Migraines, food cravings,
spontaneous bruising, mood shifts,

39:46.120 --> 39:49.480
depression, aggression, anxiety and
that asthma attack she had today.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.040
You can't prove the symptoms
coincide with menstruation.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.680
Oh, yeah?

39:53.680 --> 39:57.680
I made a graph using the postpartum
chart and Janet's diary.

39:57.800 --> 40:01.000
OK, I plotted the sudden
and severe mood shifts and,

40:01.000 --> 40:04.360
more often than not, they occurred
towards the end of each cycle since

40:04.360 --> 40:07.240
she has been on ovulating again
after the birth of her second child.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.800
We need an hCG to be absolutely sure.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.360
OK.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.880
I like this medical stuff.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.120
Instant gratification.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.800
I should have seen this.

40:18.800 --> 40:19.840
Nice diagnoses.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.440
Yeah? Thanks.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.480
I got lucky.

40:25.480 --> 40:29.480
I'm going to go talk to Janet.

40:30.560 --> 40:33.040
Hi, Jack. Hi.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.120
Hi.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.320
How did everything go?

40:35.320 --> 40:36.880
Well, I changed the password

40:36.880 --> 40:39.280
so that should stop anyone
else from breaking in.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.560
Good.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.040
I suppose some day
I should learn how this thing works.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.840
I'd be happy to show you.

40:45.840 --> 40:49.840
Not tonight.

40:54.320 --> 40:57.360
Roberta? Let me in,
we've got to talk.

40:57.360 --> 41:01.360
Victor?

41:02.240 --> 41:03.600
Victor, is that you?

41:03.600 --> 41:07.600
Of course it's me, open up.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.920
Um...

41:09.920 --> 41:11.760
..sorry about the way I look.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.680
I tried to talk to you all day.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.360
Roberta, there's something
that is going on here between you

41:16.360 --> 41:17.840
and me and I've got to stop it.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.560
What do you mean?

41:19.560 --> 41:21.440
What I mean is...

41:21.440 --> 41:25.440
What I mean is, I treasure
this relationship very, very much.

41:25.640 --> 41:27.400
Me too, Victor.

41:27.400 --> 41:30.360
Oh, brother,
you're not making this easy.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.680
I'm sorry.

41:31.680 --> 41:35.560
Oh, wait a minute, before you go on.

41:35.560 --> 41:39.440
Oh!

41:39.440 --> 41:40.480
Our tickets.

41:40.480 --> 41:43.680
For Friday night,
The Overcoat, remember?

41:43.680 --> 41:45.040
That is what I'm talking about!

41:45.040 --> 41:46.120
Tickets?

41:46.120 --> 41:49.480
No, no. Not tickets, us, you and me.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.880
I've got a career here
that is very important to me.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.560
I have worked hard
to become a surgeon.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.680
And I don't intend
to throw it all away

41:55.680 --> 41:57.920
just because you want to go see
some stupid play!

41:57.920 --> 42:00.800
Victor, I don't really think
that one play is going to...

42:00.800 --> 42:04.800
It' not just one play, it's movies
and museums and Tupperware parties.

42:06.360 --> 42:09.000
Next, you are going to want me
to stay home to have kids!

42:09.000 --> 42:10.280
What?

42:10.280 --> 42:11.200
You know what I mean.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.160
You know what I mean.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.960
Don't you see what you're doing?

42:14.960 --> 42:17.720
Do you have any idea?

42:17.720 --> 42:19.080
You take today, for instance.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.960
Someone please take today!

42:20.960 --> 42:22.440
You should have seen me,

42:22.440 --> 42:25.400
I'm running around the hospital like
a chicken with its head cut off.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.880
I know Westphall thinks
I'm some adolescent whiner

42:27.880 --> 42:30.440
and just when things
are starting to get civil

42:30.440 --> 42:34.440
between me and Craig,
I'm back to playing his fool.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.560
(SOBS)

42:36.560 --> 42:38.880
What is that? No, Roberta, honey.

42:38.880 --> 42:41.920
Honey, please don't cry.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.320
Victor, could you please go?

42:43.320 --> 42:47.320
No, wait a second,
please let me explain.

42:47.960 --> 42:50.000
Oh, Victor,
I have been awful to you.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.080
No, you haven't, I've been awful.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.880
I have, you're right.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.000
I am no good for you.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.560
No, that's not true.

42:58.560 --> 43:01.520
Oh, Victor, I'm so sorry I hurt you.

43:01.520 --> 43:05.160
No. Honey...

43:05.160 --> 43:07.800
No! Roberta.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.880
Roberta!

43:09.880 --> 43:12.000
Baby!

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
Honeybunch!

43:21.160 --> 43:25.160
Ehrlich, you're a pig.

43:42.400 --> 43:46.400
Just look at that concentration,
will you?

43:47.760 --> 43:49.400
So, how is he doing, Julie?

43:49.400 --> 43:51.600
Oh, he had a nap
and a bottle at three.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.800
He has been mostly chirping
away ever since.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.840
Mostly?

43:55.840 --> 43:58.960
Except when Kate bounced
a clutch ball off his head.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.720
He blew his stack.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.600
How is his rash?

44:02.600 --> 44:05.640
Desitin seems to help.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.120
Try giving him a bath?

44:07.120 --> 44:09.800
Yeah, our boiler
is down in the building.

44:09.800 --> 44:13.520
We haven't got any heat.

44:13.520 --> 44:16.840
How are you, Pete? Hi.

44:16.840 --> 44:19.120
Dada.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.400
Yeah.

44:20.400 --> 44:24.280
Yeah, that's me, dada!

44:24.280 --> 44:26.720
That's right, that's me,
that's your dada.

44:26.720 --> 44:28.920
That's right. That's me, dada.

44:28.920 --> 44:30.720
Dada's here, Pete.

44:30.720 --> 44:34.720
Yeah. Dada's here.

44:37.160 --> 44:40.040
Yeah, well, old myths die hard.

44:40.040 --> 44:43.120
A lot of people just assume that
it's natural for a woman to be

44:43.120 --> 44:45.000
moody and irritable once a month.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.720
They don't understand that PMS
has a real, physical cause.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.320
You mean my hormone imbalance?

44:50.320 --> 44:53.280
Right. See, the thing is,
you are an extreme example.

44:53.280 --> 44:55.680
Most women have milder symptoms
and may not even know

44:55.680 --> 44:56.920
that anything is the matter.

44:56.920 --> 44:58.080
And it is treatable?

44:58.080 --> 44:59.480
100%.

44:59.480 --> 45:01.280
It seems too easy.

45:01.280 --> 45:02.760
Are you sure I'm not crazy?

45:02.760 --> 45:05.720
I am more sure about you
than I am myself.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.760
No more questions, all right?

45:07.760 --> 45:10.640
I've got a little surprise.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.320
You ready?

45:12.320 --> 45:13.400
It depends.

45:13.400 --> 45:17.400
You're ready.

45:27.440 --> 45:31.440
I know it is a little late,
but Merry Christmas.

46:35.480 --> 46:59.000
