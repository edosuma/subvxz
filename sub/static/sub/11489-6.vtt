00:27.000 --> 00:28.990
What do you think?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.190
Nice...

00:31.200 --> 00:33.190
beat.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.790
Oh,oh,my goodness!

00:35.800 --> 00:38.490
Quite a mouth on this fella.

00:38.700 --> 00:42.190
Guess that's why they're not
called Bucket of Bunnies,huh?

00:43.200 --> 00:44.290
Who's he listening to?

00:44.300 --> 00:45.190
Bucket of Hate.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.090
They're good.Reminds me of early Who.

00:47.100 --> 00:47.990
- Who?
- Yeah.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.390
- What?
- Band's called Who.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.090
Bucket of Hate.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.290
And I work for your family.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.590
Boy...

01:00.600 --> 01:03.190
I never knew there were so
many rhymes for "suicide."

01:03.200 --> 01:05.890
Yeah,what's patricide?

01:06.200 --> 01:09.090
It means to honor thy father.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.390
Oh,well,then that song
doesn't make sense.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.290
Yeah,well,I'm still trying to
figure out what a su-su-sudio is.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.090
So,BOH is playing at the Santa
Monica Civic Center next weekend.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.090
Cool.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.690
My friend Seth Friedman
got tickets-- can I go?

01:25.700 --> 01:26.790
How are you gonna get there?

01:26.800 --> 01:28.690
Car.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.890
Thank you.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.090
Whose car?

01:34.100 --> 01:34.890
Seth's brother.

01:34.900 --> 01:38.490
He's 17 and he's never been in
an accident that was his fault.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.790
I don't think so.

01:42.800 --> 01:43.890
Why not?

01:43.900 --> 01:45.090
Why don't I think it's appropriate

01:45.100 --> 01:48.090
for a 13-year-old to go to a rock
concert with no adult supervision?

01:48.100 --> 01:50.690
I told you,Rocco's 17.

01:50.700 --> 01:53.090
- His name is Rocco?
- Yeah.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.690
So... "Rocco Friedman"?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.690
Yeah,You know him?

01:58.700 --> 02:01.290
No,but I'm not letting
someone named "Rocco Friedman"

02:01.300 --> 02:03.890
drive you to a Bucket of Hate concert.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.190
That's it? Just no?

02:06.200 --> 02:09.289
Oh,I'm sorry. No way in hell.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.690
Oh,man.

02:11.700 --> 02:12.590
What's going on?

02:12.600 --> 02:15.090
My dad sucks!

02:16.200 --> 02:19.190
You know,in certain primitive cultures

02:19.200 --> 02:22.990
when a boy hits puberty,they tie him to
a big rock and throw him in the ocean.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.390
No,they don't.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.990
Okay,but you can't argue with the logic.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.890
No,I can't.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.190
Here-- your girlfriend's
in the paper.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.790
Really? What for?

02:32.800 --> 02:37.690
She's being honored by the Southern
California Trial Lawyers Association.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.690
Judge of the Year.

02:40.700 --> 02:44.290
Yeah,I guess it's time to get out
the old tux for the banquet,huh?

02:44.300 --> 02:46.090
What banquet?

02:46.100 --> 02:48.890
The one at the Beverly
Hilton next Saturday.

02:49.100 --> 02:52.290
Oh,right.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.790
Yeah,I don't think I'm going to that.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.590
Why not?

02:56.600 --> 02:59.190
Well,you know,I hate the
whole dog and pony show.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.390
Getting dressed up,boring
speeches,rubber chicken...

03:01.400 --> 03:02.290
She didn't invite you,did she?

03:02.300 --> 03:04.690
Didn't even mention it.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.690
That's got to sting.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.990
You know,I agree with Jake.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.190
You do suck.

03:45.300 --> 03:49.090
God,Charlie, you are great.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.290
Aw,no.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.090
I'm serious.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.690
You are the best lover I've ever had.

03:56.700 --> 04:00.290
It's probably just the flawless
technique and the big penis.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.490
Probably.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.090
I was wondering-- you got
any plans next Saturday?

04:08.100 --> 04:10.290
Next Saturday?

04:10.900 --> 04:13.290
Oh,as a matter of fact I do.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.490
Oh,what might they be?

04:15.500 --> 04:17.589
The plans?

04:17.600 --> 04:18.790
Just some business thing.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.790
Very boring.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.190
- Business?
- Yeah. Business.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.590
Might this be the business
you're speaking of?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.990
Dilbert?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.590
This?

04:31.600 --> 04:32.890
Oh,that.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.590
Oh,um,I can explain.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.390
I would love an explanation.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.290
Well,I just thought it
wouldn't be your kind of thing.

04:39.300 --> 04:42.290
You know,it's just judges,
lawyers,local politicians.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.890
Are you going with somebody else?

04:43.900 --> 04:44.990
No.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.390
So you'd rather go alone than take me?

04:48.400 --> 04:51.190
Um,I know it seems that way...

04:51.200 --> 04:52.790
You're ashamed of me,aren't you?

04:52.800 --> 04:54.190
Oh,no,Charlie.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.690
I mean,sure you can use me for sex,

04:55.700 --> 04:58.190
but God forbid we're
out in public together.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.790
That is not true.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.990
And let me
remind you--

05:01.000 --> 05:02.890
it's the best sex you've ever had.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.490
- Charlie...
- Your words,not mine.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.790
Look,the last thing in the world
I want to do is hurt your feelings.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.990
Well,you have.

05:15.300 --> 05:19.390
Would you like to go
with me to the banquet?

05:19.600 --> 05:22.490
No,I don't want to go
where I'm not wanted.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.890
What do you want me to do,beg?

05:23.900 --> 05:26.590
A little,yeah.

05:28.900 --> 05:32.490
Please come with me to the banquet.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.990
A little more.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.390
Pretty please.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.290
Come with me.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.490
All right...

05:45.400 --> 05:48.290
but then we gotta talk
about this banquet thing.

05:53.900 --> 05:57.090
Jake,do you want Grandmommy to
teach you how to use chopsticks?

05:57.100 --> 05:57.890
Don't confuse him.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.990
He just learned how to use a fork.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.990
Real funny,Alan.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.790
Alan? What happened to Dad?

06:09.800 --> 06:12.490
He turned into Benito Mussoroni.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.690
The San Francisco treat?

06:18.300 --> 06:20.990
It's Mussolini,Professor.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.390
He's just upset because I won't
let him go to a concert tonight.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.590
Why not?

06:24.600 --> 06:26.290
Because there's no adult supervision.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.490
Oh,don't be such a fuddy-duddy,Alan.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.590
He's a teenager.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.690
Teenagers don't go to
concerts with their parents.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.290
I'm with Evelyn on this.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.490
Forget it.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.590
You're not going to the concert.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.990
Oh,listen to you.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.990
Remember when I said you couldn't
go to that Peter Frampton concert?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.390
You just snuck out of
the house and went anyway.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.190
Really?

06:45.200 --> 06:46.990
Mom,no.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.590
I was in Martinique at the time, but
the housekeeper was beside herself.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.890
And-And-And I was severely
punished for that,right?

06:55.900 --> 06:59.590
Oh,sure,I tried grounding you
and taking away TV privileges.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.190
But at a certain point
every parent has to accept

07:02.200 --> 07:04.990
that they're powerless when it
comes to controlling a teenager.

07:05.000 --> 07:05.690
Really?

07:05.700 --> 07:07.990
No,no,not really.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.690
Parents are powerful--
very powerful.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.090
No,no...

07:16.400 --> 07:18.890
Trust me,I'm only doing
this for your own good.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.190
What the hell was that?

07:27.200 --> 07:28.590
The same thing Grandma did.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.690
No,it's not. You sound like
you're coughing up a furball.

07:32.300 --> 07:35.290
Yeah,well,I'm making the same point.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.690
Did it even occur to you that
you could help me with this?

07:41.700 --> 07:44.790
I was not put on this
Earth to help you,Alan.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.490
You're my mother!

07:49.500 --> 07:53.390
Yes,and as you never tire of
pointing out,not a good one.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.490
Hey,Alan,do we have any snack bars?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.490
Right-hand cabinet. Why?

07:58.500 --> 08:00.590
I need something to soak up the booze

08:00.600 --> 08:02.890
I'll have to drink to make
it through this dinner.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.390
What's the occasion?

08:05.400 --> 08:07.790
My girlfriend is being
honored at a banquet tonight.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.890
Oh,I thought the Adult
Film Awards were in Vegas.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.790
She happens to be a judge.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.190
Of the Adult Film Awards?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.790
No,no,a judge in the Los
Angeles Municipal Court.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.790
So,do I look okay?

08:23.800 --> 08:25.590
It's a tuxedo. You can't go wrong.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.090
Well,I want to fit in.This
is a very conservative crowd.

08:28.100 --> 08:31.190
Oh,well,then you can go wrong.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.690
Thanks. Like I'm not nervous enough?

08:32.700 --> 08:37.390
Oh,sweetheart,if you're nervous,just
try one of these.It'll relax you.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.090
Oh,perfect.

08:39.100 --> 08:42.390
Charlie,you just can't pop a
pill without knowing what it is.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.590
She just said what it is.
Thanks,Mom. I gotta go.

08:45.300 --> 08:48.690
Bye,sweetheart. Have a good
time with your judge,darling.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.190
That'll last.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.490
I think he's really trying on this one.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.890
Uh-oh.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.890
What?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.390
Nothing.

09:05.400 --> 09:09.990
I guess I'll just have to watch my
DVD ofFantasia on the natch tonight.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.190
Congratulations, Your Honor.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.090
Well-deserved.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.290
Oh,thank you,Councilman.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.590
I'd like you to meet my
friend Charlie Harper.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.390
Charlie,this is Councilman Stewart.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.790
Charlie?

09:29.800 --> 09:31.690
Yeah,hi. How are ya?

09:32.300 --> 09:34.990
Again,congratulations.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.690
Thanks.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.390
Charlie,are you okay?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.590
I'm wonderful.

09:44.900 --> 09:47.390
Look at all the colors.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.990
It's like I'm drinking a rainbow.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.290
Hang on. He's probably in his room.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.390
Jake,your mom's on the phone!

10:09.700 --> 10:11.190
Jake?

10:16.100 --> 10:17.690
Jake?

10:25.300 --> 10:27.690
Son of a bitch!

10:28.300 --> 10:29.790
***Are you all right?

10:29.800 --> 10:31.190
What?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.790
Oh. I,uh,I stubbed my toe.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.190
Yeah. Yeah,it may be broken.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.390
Yeah. I'm,a,I'm gonna
go to the emergency room.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.390
Oh,no,no,no. I,uh, I
have to take Jake with me.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.790
So we can go in the carpool lane.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.890
Jake,help daddy find his toenail.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.090
I'll have him call you later,okay?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.790
***

11:02.500 --> 11:04.590
So,without further ado,

11:04.600 --> 11:06.290
here's our guest of honor,

11:06.300 --> 11:10.190
judge of the year and,I'm
proud to say, my good friend,

11:10.200 --> 11:11.790
Judge Linda Harris!

11:12.700 --> 11:14.190
Yeah!

11:18.900 --> 11:21.290
Who the judge? You the judge!

11:24.400 --> 11:26.290
I'm hitting at it.

11:31.100 --> 11:34.390
*pushing broom

11:34.800 --> 11:37.690
To pay for a four-bit room

11:38.400 --> 11:42.490
I'm a man of means, by no means...

11:44.100 --> 11:46.690
King of the road. o/~

11:48.900 --> 11:51.290
Los Angeles! Thank you!

11:55.400 --> 11:57.590
Hey,look who's here.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.190
Shh! Keep it down!

11:59.200 --> 12:01.690
Right. We don't want to wake me.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.290
What are you doing sitting out here?

12:05.300 --> 12:07.290
I can't stand up.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.490
Don't make a thing out of it.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.490
What are you doing?

12:12.500 --> 12:14.790
I snuck out to see a concert.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.790
No way.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.690
That is so cool.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.390
Okay.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.490
Third time's the charm.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.490
Hey.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.490
Want to know what else is cool?

12:31.500 --> 12:33.290
Check this out.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.590
Just hear the sleigh bells
ringing,ring-ting-tingling...

12:36.600 --> 12:38.190
- Shh!
- Hey! Hey!

12:38.200 --> 12:39.190
I'm caroling here.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.590
You should be bringing
me coa and gingerbread.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.390
Cocoa and gingerbread?

12:43.400 --> 12:47.090
Yeah,they work at the Screaming Rhino.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.990
But..

12:50.000 --> 12:51.790
I digress.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.590
Where were we?

12:53.600 --> 12:56.390
My dad doesn't know I went out,
so now I have to sneak back in.

12:56.400 --> 13:01.090
Oh. Well,then,you certainly don't
want to go through this door.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.590
Why not?

13:02.600 --> 13:03.590
Why not?

13:03.600 --> 13:05.590
I'll tell you why not.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.190
What?

13:14.200 --> 13:15.690
Why not?

13:15.700 --> 13:17.590
Why not what?

13:17.800 --> 13:20.090
Why can't I go through that door?

13:20.100 --> 13:23.090
Oh. Why didn't you say so?

13:24.400 --> 13:25.690
If I know your dad...

13:25.700 --> 13:28.590
and,sadly,I do,

13:28.600 --> 13:30.790
he's sitting in there right now

13:30.800 --> 13:34.890
just waiting to tie you to a
rock and throw you in the ocean.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.290
What?

13:37.300 --> 13:40.890
Sorry. I may have put
the idea in his head.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.890
Follow me.

13:45.000 --> 13:45.790
Where are we going?

13:45.800 --> 13:49.090
Hey! I'll ask the questions.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.190
Where are we going?

13:58.900 --> 14:00.790
I'm okay.

14:03.200 --> 14:03.990
Here.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.090
Grab my what-do-
you-call-it. Hand.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.190
I'm okay.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.990
That's good,but you're
sitting on my head.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.590
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you're in?

14:22.600 --> 14:24.790
I do not.

14:25.400 --> 14:29.490
Do you have any idea how
beautiful you look in that light?

14:29.500 --> 14:30.690
I'm not talking to you.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.390
Well,I'm not talking to you either.

14:33.700 --> 14:34.990
Except for right now.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.190
This is me talking to you.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.590
But,no longer.

14:40.700 --> 14:43.690
Would you please just... go to sleep.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.190
Okey-dokey.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.490
You and I have some talking to do.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.290
Will you make up your freaking mind.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.390
Morning.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.390
What,you're not talking to me now?

15:05.400 --> 15:07.490
I looked up "patricide."

15:10.800 --> 15:11.890
Really.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.890
When did you learn to spell?

15:14.800 --> 15:16.790
I sounded it out.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.490
Patricide,huh?

15:20.500 --> 15:22.890
Our little boy's growing up.

15:23.900 --> 15:27.390
He's just upset 'cause he snuck out
so I grounded him for three months.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.890
Ooh,that'll show him.

15:28.900 --> 15:30.690
What am I gonna
do,Berta? I can't hit him.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.190
Well,sure you can.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.890
You just gotta figure
the wind,and lead him.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.090
They're like pheasants.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.090
Very funny.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.290
What?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.890
Charlie's gonna want to see this.

15:47.900 --> 15:50.090
No,he's not.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.490
Charlie?

15:54.500 --> 15:55.290
Wake up.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.990
You need to see this.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.390
Can I throw up in it?

15:59.400 --> 16:00.490
No.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.990
Then I don't need to see it.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.090
Charlie,do you remember
what you did last night?

16:09.900 --> 16:12.090
Oh,damn it.

16:12.100 --> 16:14.390
Did I get married?

16:15.700 --> 16:17.290
Hardly.

16:27.800 --> 16:32.090
No. I just know she's gonna
find a way to make thismyfault.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.890
You climbed out the window?

16:38.900 --> 16:41.990
And got into a car driven
by a 17-year-old boy.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.490
It wasn't a car,Dad.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.290
It was an extremely safe monster truck.

16:46.300 --> 16:49.690
I mean,even if Rocco hit
another car,he'd just crush it.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.990
The point is, you disobeyed your father.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.590
That doesn't mean I have to
get grounded for three months.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.890
Hey,in my opinion,your
punishment isn't severe enough.

16:56.900 --> 16:57.790
Your mother's right.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.290
How come nobody ever asks my opinion?

17:00.300 --> 17:02.690
Go to your room and
we'll talk to you later.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.190
fine

17:05.000 --> 17:07.490
Hey,thanks for backing
me up here,Judith.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.390
Now that he's a teenager,we really
need to stick together in order to...

17:10.400 --> 17:12.790
You don't have a brain
in your head,do you?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.490
You have to watch teenagers,Alan.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.990
You can't just expect
that they'lllistenand obey.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.390
God,you're useless.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.790
Here,let me give you a hand.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.490
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.990
Now,come with me.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.490
Where are we going?

17:45.500 --> 17:46.990
You're going back to your room.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.490
And I am going to the
sweet land of vindication.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.190
Oh,Judith?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.590
Yes?

18:01.500 --> 18:02.690
Hey.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.490
What are you doing here?

18:05.400 --> 18:07.190
I came to apologize.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.390
I am sorry about last night.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.990
You're sorry?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.990
For ruing one of the most
important nights of my career?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.890
For embarrassing me
within an inch of my life.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.090
Ooh... yeah.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.090
I mean,unless I did something else.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.090
No,you did quite enough, thank you.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.190
Look,I understand why you're mad,

18:25.200 --> 18:27.290
but it really wasn't my fault.

18:27.300 --> 18:28.790
I was nervous about last night,

18:28.800 --> 18:32.390
so my mother gave me what I assumed
was one of her tranquilizers.

18:32.400 --> 18:36.790
But now I'm thinking it was a little
something she had left over from Woodstock.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.290
Charlie.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.290
Look.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.290
You're a lot of fun and,and I like you,

18:43.300 --> 18:46.590
but people are talking about me
running for state senate next year.

18:46.600 --> 18:50.790
and I can't afford to be linked
publicly to someone like you.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.290
Well,that's not a problem.

18:52.300 --> 18:55.090
We'll just sneak around
and link privately.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.090
No,Charlie.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.790
Oh,come on. All the guy politicians
have something on the side.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.490
Why shouldn't you?

19:06.500 --> 19:08.390
Take care.

19:13.100 --> 19:17.490
It would send a powerful message
to young women everywhere.

19:18.900 --> 19:21.690
- Bailiff!
- I'm going.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.390
Pretty flowers.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.690
Thanks.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.090
Want to stick them in something?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.490
Never mind.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.490
I thought I was up to it,Alan.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.190
I thought I was ready
for a real relationship,

19:50.200 --> 19:52.590
and Linda and I would be a team.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.590
I'd stand by her as an
accomplished woman and a judge

19:56.600 --> 19:58.990
and she'd stand by me as a...

19:59.500 --> 20:01.490
Reformed whoremonger?

20:04.200 --> 20:05.490
So you believe I was trying.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.490
I do.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.590
And you know what? Someday you'll look
back on this as a growing experience.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.890
Maybe.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.490
Someday.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.890
Oh,who could that be?

20:18.300 --> 20:19.790
I ordered some takeout.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.190
Ah,nice,Italian?

20:21.200 --> 20:22.890
Nope.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.990
Hi.Are you Charlie?

20:25.000 --> 20:26.590
Yeah,come on in.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.690
Greek.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.290
Be patient with me.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.790
I'm coming off a bad breakup.

20:37.300 --> 20:40.890
And,as usual,Alan gets chicken pot pie.
