00:02.080 --> 00:05.360
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:07.360
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.400
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.280
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:18.400 --> 00:21.680
<i>Before going to work,
Michael decided to have a little fun.</i>

00:21.760 --> 00:25.440
I'm doing a little cost-projection
analysis for a mini-mall.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.960
Wow. That's pretty cool you
know how to do all that stuff.

00:28.040 --> 00:33.120
Yeah. Well, maybe your old man is just a
little bit cooler than you thought he was.

00:33.240 --> 00:37.600
Stupid. Stupid chair.
Very stupid chair.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.240
But it's also this stupid
model home furniture.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.520
Maybe I oughta get myself one of those
nice leather chairs from work.

00:44.640 --> 00:48.520
- People can take chairs home from work?
- Well, not everybody.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.000
But I'm the president of
the Bluth Company since Dad's in jail.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.760
It's okay if I take a little
something from work, you know?

00:53.880 --> 00:57.240
Yeah, but isn't that why Grandpa's in jail,
because he took things from work?

00:57.320 --> 00:59.200
You're a good kid, you know that?

00:59.320 --> 01:03.280
I mean, a chair costs money,
so it's like stealing, and you always say...

01:03.400 --> 01:05.040
Not stealing. Not.

01:05.120 --> 01:09.520
I'm the one that taught you
stealing is bad, all right?

01:09.600 --> 01:12.800
I'm just saying, you know,
if I got a leather chair, okay?

01:12.880 --> 01:15.360
And I get to lean back...
Oh, this one's gonna go.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.560
Leather chair? So, you're against stealing,
but skinning cows is cool with you.

01:22.680 --> 01:27.200
I'm fine, by the way. Frankly, your concern
is getting embarrassing.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.160
- Since when are you against leather?
- You're not even a vegetarian.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.520
<i>I'm not against the insides.
People need meat to survive.</i>

01:32.640 --> 01:35.000
You are aware they don't remove it
from the cow surgically, right?

01:35.080 --> 01:39.040
Hi, Michael.

01:39.160 --> 01:42.640
Marta, hi. Hey, it's Marta.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.160
Hey, Marta, everybody.
Great to see you.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.200
- I was just looking for Gob.
- Well, you're his girlfriend.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.480
<i>Michael wished Marta
was his girlfriend.</i>

01:51.560 --> 01:53.760
<i>A secret he had only shared
with Lindsay.</i>

01:53.880 --> 01:56.960
Actually, we had a big fight.
He thought I was belittling his career...

01:57.040 --> 02:00.440
- but I never would do that.
- Neither would I. What career?

02:00.520 --> 02:03.520
- The magic?
- Oh, the tricks. The little tricks.

02:03.640 --> 02:04.535
- Those are great.

02:04.536 --> 02:07.120
- Well, he didn't like my
reaction to his new one.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.120
Real needle. Real apple.

02:10.759 --> 02:13.080
Real neck.

02:15.480 --> 02:19.200
Él es zombi!

02:19.320 --> 02:21.720
They're children!
How could you do that?

02:21.800 --> 02:25.440
Oh, sure. First you dump all over it,
now you wanna know how it's done.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.080
- And I wanted to apologize.
- Well, he hasn't been here.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.920
But he said he was
staying here. Oh, my God.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.640
- Maybe he's staying with another woman.
- No, no, no. No, no.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.920
He is staying here.
I just haven't seen him here...

02:38.000 --> 02:40.080
the foyer or the kitchen.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.680
- Well, that's a relief.
- Yeah.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.320
- Well, tell him to call me when he gets in.
- I sure will, Marta.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.360
- If you remember.
- I will remember.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.160
Yeah. I'll give him
the message though. Okay.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.520
- She's gone.
- Yep. Got it.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.960
- You are too nice.
- Oh, come on. What was I supposed to do?

02:57.080 --> 03:00.400
Tell her that Gob is not staying here?
Tell her Gob is screwing around on her?

03:00.480 --> 03:03.840
God knows where he is?
Actually, that-that sounded okay.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.880
Nah, you'll never be able to do it.
You're too good.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
- You're the noble one.
- Thank you.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.920
- The one who never wins.
- I-I don't know about that.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.360
- The loser. The fool.
- Hmm?

03:14.560 --> 03:17.280
She is such a hypocrite.
Doesn't it drive you nuts?

03:17.400 --> 03:20.280
- Crazy. Wait. Who is? Which part?
- My mom.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.720
She pretends to care
about all these causes.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.040
<i>Lindsay had always been celebrated...</i>

03:25.120 --> 03:28.920
<i>for her wine and cheese
charity fund-raisers.</i>

03:31.840 --> 03:33.498
I mean, now she's anti-leather?

03:33.499 --> 03:36.600
Let's see how she feels when
her daughter's pro-leather.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.840
Wanna go shopping with me?
I bet you could get something cool.

03:39.960 --> 03:43.120
<i>In fact, George Michael
had been trying to prove to Maeby...</i>

03:43.200 --> 03:46.200
<i>that he was macho, after
an embarrassing brush with her.</i>

03:46.320 --> 03:49.440
Your legs look exactly like mine,
and I just shaved mine.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.880
So I'm thinking of getting a motorcycle.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.112
I'm gonna need a leather
jacket when I'm on my hog

03:55.113 --> 03:56.800
and need to go into a controlled slide.

03:56.920 --> 04:02.160
There's my little girl. I've got great news.
Daddy has the entire day off.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.520
But you have every day off.
You don't have a job.

04:04.640 --> 04:08.200
Well... I don't need money to hang
out with my daughter. Where are you going?

04:08.320 --> 04:10.720
- We're going shopping.
- Oh, no, no. I can't do that.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.160
<i>The next day, Michael
was stopped on his way to work.</i>

04:14.240 --> 04:15.960
<i>- Get in.
- What?</i>

04:16.040 --> 04:19.480
If you care about your brother,
you'll get in this car.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.080
- Which brother?
- Gob.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:33.360 --> 04:35.200
Let me be clearer.

04:35.280 --> 04:39.200
Tell him Rollo wants him to
say good-bye to his legs.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.840
<i>- Michael went looking for Gob.
- Mom.</i>

04:54.920 --> 04:58.400
I'm so glad you're here. I want you to help
me break up your brother and his girlfriend.

04:58.520 --> 05:01.120
Well, I'm all for that.
We've just gotta find him first.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.280
- He's locked on the balcony.
- Oh.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.720
You meant Buster.
I thought you were talking about Gob.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.560
No. I will not have Buster
dating my best friend.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.480
<i>Tension had been high
between the two Lucilles...</i>

05:12.600 --> 05:14.960
<i>since Buster had announced
he'd been dating her.</i>

05:15.040 --> 05:17.029
<i>Although neither had addressed this,</i>

05:17.030 --> 05:19.680
<i>both had given indications
of their true feelings.</i>

05:19.800 --> 05:21.148
- Mom, you're ruining our fort.

05:21.149 --> 05:23.280
- I mean, she's been a
family friend for years.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.880
It's just... creepy.

05:25.960 --> 05:29.240
Hi, buddy. Mom, I think
you might be overreacting.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.520
She changed him as a baby.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.920
Okay. That-That's about
the creepiest thing I've ever heard.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.080
That's why she didn't look surprised.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.760
You're the only child who chose a spouse
I liked, and she's the one who had to die.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.640
I know. That's rough for you.
Mom, I'm looking for Gob.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.120
There's some people after him, and I
don't know whether it's gambling or what...

05:47.200 --> 05:50.200
but, um, they wanna break his legs.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.600
It's a good thing he's already got
that little scooter.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.320
Oh, don't give me that look.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.760
I happen to be
a more caring mother than most.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.760
- Where's my bed?
- I put it in storage.

06:01.880 --> 06:05.480
I guess you'll just have to decide which
Lucille you want to spend your nights with.

06:05.600 --> 06:11.000
Okay. Before I leave this place
for the last time ever, has anyone seen Gob?

06:11.080 --> 06:15.080
I saw him last night
at the Playtime Pizza Theater. On my date.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.640
Of which I have
another one tonight.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.000
And I'm going to
continue dating, Mom.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.800
Sounds a little bit like "dating Mom. "

06:22.880 --> 06:26.360
- It's starting to feel a little like it.
- Hmm.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.960
<i>Lucille decided she needed
the help of Buster's father.</i>

06:30.080 --> 06:32.720
<i>Unfortunately,
after a recent escape attempt...</i>

06:32.800 --> 06:35.800
<i>George Sr. had been
put in solitary confinement.</i>

07:01.960 --> 07:04.440
<i>Michael went to find
his brother at his latest gig.</i>

07:04.520 --> 07:06.760
- What's up, Mike?
- Yeah. What are you doing here?

07:06.880 --> 07:09.560
Can't get any work, Mike.
Magicians' Alliance has blackballed me...

07:09.640 --> 07:11.480
- from every venue in town.
- Hmm.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.560
Even my own so-called girlfriend
doesn't believe in me.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.160
Well, I don't wanna get into
that part of your life anymore.

07:16.280 --> 07:19.120
Okay. Listen, I just came here to tell you
that this guy named Rollo...

07:19.200 --> 07:21.080
pulled me over
and made some threats.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.520
- What kind of threats?
- He said to say good-bye to your legs.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.520
I don't know whether
this guy's a mobster, a loan shark...

07:26.600 --> 07:28.480
- something equally scary.
- A magician.

07:28.600 --> 07:32.680
I think you're confusing scary with silly.
This guy was frightening. He was in a limo.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.520
No, he's a magician.
He replaced me in the Alliance.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.760
<i>He's the reason I gotta
do my act in this hellhole.</i>

07:38.880 --> 07:41.240
- Why does he wanna break your legs?
- He doesn't wanna break my legs.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.640
- He wants to take my legs.
- I-I don't...

07:43.720 --> 07:47.040
The legs... The bottom half of
my saw-the-lady-in-half trick.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.240
No, not now. I'm showing him
how to do the trick.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.320
<i>Two chicks curl up in a box.
We call one the head and one the legs.</i>

07:52.440 --> 07:53.666
- So that's how they do it.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.800
- God, I gotta stop
giving these things away.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.600
The top half there,
what do you do about that?

07:57.680 --> 08:00.200
- I just get a volunteer from the crowd.
- Oh, yeah?

08:00.320 --> 08:02.840
The old top half quit when she found out
I was sleeping with the legs.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.600
I guess word
really gets around in there.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.760
So Rollo wants your legs, but you're
cheating on Marta with those legs.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.160
Would you give me a break, please?
The legs are insanely jealous.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.160
Is that why you haven't seen Marta for the
past few days? This is about your love life.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.720
I can't believe it. Just forget it.
I came here to try to help...

08:17.800 --> 08:22.200
- Hey, I appreciate your time.
- Great. Great.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.200
You know what, Gob?

08:24.320 --> 08:28.040
Marta is a once-in-a-lifetime
woman. She's a treasure.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.240
And I don't think you're showing her
enough respect, okay?

08:30.360 --> 08:32.440
She doesn't respect my career.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.400
Okay.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.520
<i>He's having sex with a woman in his act?</i>

08:39.640 --> 08:42.039
I gotta tell Marta what's going on.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.280
First of all, she'll hate you for it.
It's called shoot the messenger.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.720
Secondly, it's not in your nature.
I mean, you're like Mr. Morals.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.960
- You can't even take a desk chair.
- Damn it.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.507
I
- I'm a saint, you know? I'm a living saint,

08:52.508 --> 08:54.520
and I get absolutely nothing out of it.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.240
Well, you get a false feeling
of superiority.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.800
I know. That is nice,
but this time, it's not enough.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.840
Why do I always have to be the one that
has to set the good example for everyone?

09:03.960 --> 09:07.600
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, that's why.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.000
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.200
Moo?

09:15.320 --> 09:17.960
Mmm. Moo, honey.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.760
You have to be some sort of
she hulk to get this.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.880
- You just gotta really dig.
- Well, it's not... enjoy...

09:24.960 --> 09:28.520
Oh, Maeby, great news.
I got my hands on some money.

09:28.640 --> 09:32.360
I can't say how or when...
or where my wedding ring is...

09:32.480 --> 09:36.720
but, my purse overfloweth
as do my high spirits...

09:36.800 --> 09:40.120
- so a-shopping we must go.
- Dad, we already went.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.680
That's why we're wearing all this leather.
I'm really into leather.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.520
- Tell Mom.
- Yes.

09:47.640 --> 09:51.010
- If you ever need to borrow
any money or anything...

09:51.011 --> 09:52.320
- No. Thank you, no.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.680
<i>So Tobias chose to pursue
a common interest with his daughter.</i>

09:55.800 --> 09:56.820
- May I help you?

09:56.821 --> 10:00.240
- I hope so. Um, I'm looking
for something that says...

10:00.320 --> 10:04.160
- "Dad likes leather. "
- Something that says, "leather daddy"?

10:04.280 --> 10:06.200
Oh, is there such a thing?

10:06.320 --> 10:08.680
<i>Later that day,
Michael got a surprise visit.</i>

10:08.800 --> 10:10.680
- Marta. What are you doing here?
- I was looking for Gob.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.920
- He said he was working here today.
- Oh, yes? Please.

10:14.040 --> 10:18.080
He said that, huh?
Said that he's working, huh? Wow. Here?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.640
What else did he say? Did he tell you
I gave him your message?

10:21.760 --> 10:24.360
- Not that I'm the messenger, you know?
- He told me.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.360
I don't know what you said to him,
but it really turned him around.

10:27.480 --> 10:31.320
- He said I was a treasure.
- She's a treasure.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.880
<i>And a once-in-a-lifetime
woman. - Mm-hmm.</i>

10:35.000 --> 10:39.160
Listen, Marta, Gob is...

10:41.560 --> 10:43.840
- a poet.
- Mm.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.920
He's touched. I'm gonna tell him
that you stopped by...

10:47.040 --> 10:50.040
- and, uh, you have a nice day.
- Thank you.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.320
You're such a good brother.
Always trying to help him.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.440
- He showed me the watch you gave him.
- The watch?

10:57.520 --> 10:59.720
I appreciate your time.

10:59.840 --> 11:03.320
<i>And so, for the first time,
Michael set a plan in motion...</i>

11:03.400 --> 11:05.440
<i>to take something
that didn't belong to him.</i>

11:05.560 --> 11:10.080
You know, I was thinking, I'd like to
help you guys out one more time.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.640
You know what you should do?
You should surprise Gob onstage.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.846
- I know that he's looking
for a new assistant.

11:15.847 --> 11:16.280
- Really?

11:16.400 --> 11:17.880
- Mm-hmm.
- Could you help me with that?

11:17.960 --> 11:22.240
- Yes.
- You really are a good guy, Michael.

11:22.320 --> 11:27.160
Well, you can't change who you are.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.120
<i>Michael went to
the popular magic parlor...</i>

11:43.200 --> 11:46.200
<i>the Gothic Castle, to ask a favor of Rollo.</i>

11:46.320 --> 11:51.520
I was wondering if, uh... if you would
give my brother a show?

11:51.600 --> 11:55.480
One more chance to get back in
with the Alliance. That's all I ask.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.760
<i>And-And you will get your legs back.</i>

11:57.880 --> 12:00.160
How?

12:00.240 --> 12:03.040
You're asking me to reveal my trick?

12:03.160 --> 12:05.440
<i>So Michael went to give
his brother the good news.</i>

12:05.520 --> 12:06.411
- Really, tomorrow night?

12:06.412 --> 12:08.800
- Yeah. You just gotta make sure
you do the sawing in half trick.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.920
- I don't even have a top half.
- Don't worry about that.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.806
I got someone I want you
to use. She's perfect.

12:12.807 --> 12:14.240
A great girl. You're doing me a favor.

12:14.360 --> 12:18.120
- Has she got big cans?
- I'll see ya there, Gob.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.320
- You're a good brother.
- You're a horrible brother, Michael.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.480
Pretty good, huh?

12:22.560 --> 12:25.120
You're gonna put Marta
onstage with the legs?

12:25.240 --> 12:28.080
It's gonna blow up.
Legs get upset. Marta gets upset.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.560
Marta leaves Gob,
and I don't get shot.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.680
You'll never be able to
pull the trigger on this.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.648
- You can't escape it,
Michael. You're the good guy.

12:34.649 --> 12:35.520
- Call me what you want.

12:35.600 --> 12:40.160
- An impotent man-boy?
- But it is done. The plan is in motion.

12:40.240 --> 12:45.200
- This just isn't you.
- It's me now. It's the me that can recline.

12:45.280 --> 12:48.480
- Did that hurt?
- No.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.040
This stuff's kind of hot, isn't it?

12:52.160 --> 12:55.160
- I hadn't noticed.
- Hey, gang.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.720
Mind if squeeze in here
for a moment? Oh!

12:58.840 --> 13:01.680
Look at us. Who'd wanna mess with
any of us, huh?

13:04.120 --> 13:06.640
- Excuse me.
- Yes. Oop.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.440
- Did you get a job or something?
- No. No, I didn't.

13:12.520 --> 13:16.640
Unless you consider
"World's Coolest Daddy" a job.

13:16.720 --> 13:20.240
If I...

13:20.320 --> 13:21.051
- Hey, Dad.

13:21.052 --> 13:24.640
- Hey, buddy. You're still
wearing that jacket, huh?

13:24.760 --> 13:27.160
- Yeah. I was just going for a new look.
- Yeah?

13:27.280 --> 13:29.360
Trying to introduce
some edge to the whole palette.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.000
- Hmm. Kind of liked you the way you were.
- You did?

13:32.120 --> 13:34.120
Yeah. I mean, we can't really change
who we are anyway, right?

13:34.240 --> 13:37.640
Wish you'd told me that before
I threw away my Windbreaker.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.965
- Oh, you bought a chair.

13:38.966 --> 13:41.760
- Uh, no, actually, I borrowed
it. Like we talked about.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.680
Well, I thought we decided
that was like stealing.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.880
Is that where we landed on that?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.640
<i>As Michael was becoming more selfish...</i>

13:49.760 --> 13:52.760
<i>his father was choosing
a more pious path.</i>

13:55.520 --> 13:59.600
<i>Which made Buster and Lucille's visit
go much differently than planned.</i>

13:59.680 --> 14:01.480
Why is there
a piece of shoe on your head?

14:01.600 --> 14:05.400
This is a... Well, it's a reminder that
the divine presence...

14:05.480 --> 14:07.280
is always above me.

14:07.360 --> 14:12.120
Well, more importantly,
Buster's been humping the widow Austero.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.040
- Mom.
- Is that true?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.680
No. We're taking it slow.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.000
He stays there sometimes
until 7:00, 8:00 at night.

14:20.120 --> 14:24.440
<i>Peanut brittle on his breath. Is she the one
who's going to take him to the dentist?</i>

14:24.560 --> 14:26.880
She already has.

14:34.400 --> 14:34.696
- What?

14:34.697 --> 14:37.280
- "May you live. May you be
well. I give you my blessing. "

14:37.360 --> 14:40.360
- Wow! Really?
- Are you out of your mind?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.491
- Just follow the heart
that God gave you, hmm?

14:42.492 --> 14:43.120
- No touching.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.200
No...

14:51.600 --> 14:54.280
Can you get me
some of that peanut brittle?

14:54.400 --> 14:58.320
<i>On the night of the show,
the family arrived at the Gothic Castle...</i>

14:58.400 --> 15:02.080
<i>and in the green room, Michael was
preparing Marta for the trick.</i>

15:02.160 --> 15:06.560
At the bottom of the box.
And you two guys are free to talk.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.360
Okay. Gob, Gob, Gob.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.320
What is going on?
Where's the top half?

15:10.400 --> 15:15.120
I have to teach her this trick.
She's gotta fold her knees.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.400
It's a fantastic trick. I don't want you
to worry though. I've already told her.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.560
Now where are the legs?
Are they running late?

15:20.640 --> 15:23.760
- So is everyone here?
- I think so. I haven't seen Tobias.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.840
<i>In fact, Tobias
had intended to come...</i>

15:26.960 --> 15:30.080
<i>but had a slight miscommunication
with his cabdriver.</i>

15:30.160 --> 15:32.520
- Where to, mate?
- The Gothic Castle.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.080
- Gothic Asshole?
- That's what I said.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.880
<i>And ended up
in the wrong location.</i>

15:41.120 --> 15:44.160
Oh, I am glad
I didn't go with that outfit.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.200
Yes, hello. I am looking for the magic.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.760
<i>Danke schön.</i>

15:52.920 --> 15:55.600
Oh. Hello, Lucille.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.680
Hello, Lucille.
Having a good time with my son?

15:58.800 --> 16:03.240
- Actually, we're having a wonderful time.
- You know, he's damaged goods.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.760
- He was born with a hole in his heart.
- Now listen to me, Lucille.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.536
- I'm gonna fill that
hole, 'cause we're in love.

16:08.537 --> 16:09.280
- Oh, please.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.120
You're no more in love
with him than I am.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.720
Okay. We're all saying some things
we're going to regret.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.240
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was
almost ready to begin his show.</i>

16:17.360 --> 16:20.200
Okay. It's magic time.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.600
- Hey, good luck out there now.
- Listen, I got you something...

16:22.720 --> 16:26.520
for being such a good guy...
not that it's a surprise, you always are.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.960
Oh, well, uh...

16:30.880 --> 16:33.280
- My watch.
- I want you to have it.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.080
Well, you've stolen so many things
from me over the years.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.680
This is the first time
you've ever given something back.

16:38.800 --> 16:42.640
I wanna try to be a better brother,
like you are to me.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.960
<i>We're ready for you.</i>

16:46.720 --> 16:48.040
<i>Gob...</i>

16:48.160 --> 16:51.480
have a good show out there.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.960
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, a magician named Gob.</i>

17:14.000 --> 17:16.520
<i>- Dad?
- Hey, George Michael.</i>

17:16.640 --> 17:17.910
- Where's the leather jacket?

17:17.911 --> 17:20.319
- It's like you said... you
can't change who you are.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.920
So what? So I don't have
any hair on my arms or legs. So what?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.920
You know, a leather jacket's
not gonna change that.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.560
You know, I was trying to
act like a tough guy, and it's wrong.

17:28.640 --> 17:32.600
- I'm just a boring, old nice guy like you.
- I'm not that nice.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.080
Dad, if this is about
the chair... I've been thinking.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.160
You deserve it. You know, it's not like
you'd ever steal something big.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.560
<i>Michael was having
second thoughts about his plan.</i>

17:41.680 --> 17:43.640
<i>But then he got some unexpected help.</i>

17:43.760 --> 17:47.040
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt. You'd better
tell Gob, the legs aren't coming.

17:47.120 --> 17:47.694
- Oh, my God.

17:47.695 --> 17:50.120
- I can't believe the legs
would screw him like this.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.920
This is his one last chance. They'll never
let him in the Alliance again.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.760
You have to do something.
This is so important to me and Gob.

17:59.720 --> 18:03.200
Where am I gonna get a pair of beautiful
women's legs on such short notice?

18:05.040 --> 18:07.320
<i>So, the trick went forward as planned.</i>

18:07.400 --> 18:11.800
And now, my, hopefully,
lovely assistant will join me.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.720
Wiggle those sexy gams, lady.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.320
I'm okay with myself.
I'm okay with myself.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.240
Mom, did you see it? I'm back in.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.520
I've got the career back.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.400
<i>- Thank you for coming.
- And when Lucille noticed...</i>

18:50.480 --> 18:55.880
<i>how happy Marta had made Gob, she realized
how important love was to her children.</i>

18:57.720 --> 18:59.840
- Mom.
- Hello, Buster.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.720
If you're still mad,
I don't care. I'm in love.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.000
I actually came to ask
Lucille something.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.080
<i>- What?
- I was wondering...</i>

19:08.160 --> 19:10.880
if you'd like to play bridge
with me next week?

19:14.160 --> 19:17.200
I'd absolutely adore it. Oh, Lucille.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.520
Oh, God. Look at us, Buster.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.040
We're back together again.
Lucille and Lucille.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.320
You guys are friends again.
You can play bridge together.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.760
Could you just... just separate?

19:32.880 --> 19:37.440
<i>Michael watched as
the brother he swore to stop helping...</i>

19:37.520 --> 19:40.360
<i>enjoyed the girlfriend
he helped him reunite with.</i>

19:42.960 --> 19:47.560
<i>And so he returned to work, accepting
the fact that he was a good guy.</i>

19:48.960 --> 19:50.960
<i>But not as good as everyone thought.</i>

19:55.960 --> 19:57.760
This really worked better with the chair.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.840
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

20:00.960 --> 20:03.400
<i>The Alliance decides to let Gob back in.</i>

20:03.520 --> 20:06.840
Tell me, how'd you get two Alliance-approved
assistants with such short notice?

20:06.960 --> 20:10.840
That was just my girlfriend and my nephew.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.120
Well, you're out.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.520
<i>- And Tobias gets some good news.
- I got a gig.</i>
