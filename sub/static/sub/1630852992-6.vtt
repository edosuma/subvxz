00:09.760 --> 00:11.637
Some people like movies,

00:12.262 --> 00:13.680
and some people love movies.

00:14.348 --> 00:18.644
Some people breathe and dream movies,

00:18.727 --> 00:19.978
and I'm the latter.

00:20.062 --> 00:21.188
Action.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.024
But this industry is broken,

00:25.192 --> 00:26.527
and it was built this way.

00:27.819 --> 00:32.406
It wasn't built on a solid foundation
that was equitable, and then it broke.

00:32.491 --> 00:35.285
It was built in such a way
that some people knew how to get in

00:35.369 --> 00:36.370
and some people didn't.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.538
Ava DuVernay.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.373
Groundbreaking director and producer.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.166
…breaking down walls in her industry…

00:41.250 --> 00:43.627
…and making Hollywood more inclusive.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.547
So when you see a film made by a woman
or a person of color,

00:47.214 --> 00:49.508
it is a radical act that's been achieved.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.843
Dear Ava…

00:50.926 --> 00:52.302
- Dear Ava…
- Dear Ava…

00:52.386 --> 00:54.137
You are a true change agent.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.265
Thank you
for pushing against the status quo.

00:56.348 --> 01:00.310
My name has a bunch of firsts after it.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.814
But it doesn't have
a lot of meaning for me,

01:03.897 --> 01:08.068
because these firsts don't change
the system

01:08.151 --> 01:12.322
that made it so that
the first came so far into the game.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.534
Thank you for using your platform
to move culture forward.

01:15.617 --> 01:19.204
Because of you,
I decided we had to do something.

01:19.288 --> 01:22.666
We've got to be intentional
about the way we walk through the world,

01:23.250 --> 01:27.254
because your intentions
can have unexpected echoes.

01:27.337 --> 01:31.800
And if your dream only includes you,
it's way too small.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.594
Dear Ava…

02:00.621 --> 02:03.498
I was born and raised
in my early life in Compton.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.251
I'm the oldest of five.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.961
My brothers are much younger than me,

02:09.045 --> 02:11.423
so I grew up with my two sisters,
Jina and Tera.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.258
I was the oldest,

02:13.342 --> 02:18.180
so I kind of naturally fell into
that position of being in charge.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.059
Every family goes to a restaurant,

02:22.142 --> 02:25.479
and it's one person in the family
who says, "Party of five."

02:25.562 --> 02:27.064
That's me. I'm the one.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.274
Everyone stands and waits for me
to come up and say,

02:29.358 --> 02:33.237
"There's six of us. We'd like a window."
That kind of thing.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.155
So, that's my role.

02:35.239 --> 02:38.075
And I was lucky enough
to have a beautiful childhood

02:38.158 --> 02:41.620
and was taken care of and had a roof
over my head and a warm place and food.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.749
People make assumptions about Compton
and say,

02:46.250 --> 02:48.502
"You must have had it rough. Wow."

02:49.086 --> 02:52.464
But I think what people get about Compton
is what they've heard in songs

02:52.548 --> 02:54.383
and a few films.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.805
And that's not the totality of that place.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.475
They make an assumption
about what that place is,

03:04.142 --> 03:07.855
one that doesn't allow
for Compton to be imbued

03:07.938 --> 03:09.773
with a sense of community and family.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.110
But that's what I saw all the time,
growing up there

03:13.193 --> 03:14.736
and in the neighborhoods around it.

03:17.781 --> 03:21.577
The distance between Compton and Hollywood
in miles is significant,

03:21.660 --> 03:24.496
but in spirit is way further.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.085
I didn't grow up with anyone in my family

03:30.169 --> 03:32.546
who worked anywhere near
the entertainment industry.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.841
If you had asked me,
"What is a film director?"

03:35.924 --> 03:37.342
I would have said Steven Spielberg.

03:38.802 --> 03:41.388
And in order to be a director,
you had to look like him.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.140
First of all, you had to wear glasses.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.560
You gotta have jeans, glasses.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.062
You gotta have that jacket
that the guys wear.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.898
You know, I mean, you gotta be that guy.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.194
There's nobody looking like me doing it.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.070
Real people don't make movies.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.989
Real people like me
sure don't make movies.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.409
It wasn't even in my consciousness
that it was possible.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.995
But I love movies.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.331
My favorite movie of all time
is West Side Story.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.001
My aunt Denise showed me the film,

04:11.084 --> 04:13.837
and I can remember it to this day.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.339
It was a rainy day.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.091
I sit down. The movie starts.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.221
And I watched that thing, transfixed.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.681
Transfixed.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.143
I saw brown people in the film,

04:28.227 --> 04:30.229
people like the folks in my neighborhood.

04:30.312 --> 04:33.732
And it was the story,
and the dancing, and the colors,

04:33.815 --> 04:35.859
and the drama and the romance.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.694
Did I say the dancing and the colors?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.322
I love that movie.

04:40.405 --> 04:44.868
And it just started
a lifelong love affair with film.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.373
I went to UCLA.
I loved my experience there.

04:49.456 --> 04:53.210
I was a double major in English
and African American studies.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.337
And I was hanging out

04:55.420 --> 05:01.677
at a health food store/hip-hop open mic in
South Central LA called "the Good Life."

05:03.345 --> 05:06.723
The Good Life was the vibrant atmosphere

05:06.807 --> 05:11.603
of young people who were experimenting
with rhyme and rhythm.

05:11.687 --> 05:15.691
And my very first feature-length piece

05:15.774 --> 05:18.527
was a documentary
about that place and time.

05:21.071 --> 05:24.700
I was at UCLA
during the Rodney King beating.

05:25.200 --> 05:31.665
And so that time at the Good Life collided
with what was going on in LA at that time.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.501
And it wasn't just Rodney King.
It was Daryl Gates.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.254
It was challenges with the LAPD.
It was Latasha Harlins.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.465
There was so much going on.
So much tension.

05:40.549 --> 05:44.511
It felt like a full-frontal assault
on Black personhood

05:44.595 --> 05:46.013
in Los Angeles at that time.

05:48.640 --> 05:53.937
And so being young in this place
was highly foundational

05:54.021 --> 05:56.773
to the things that are
important to me now.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.821
After college, I became a publicist.
I kind of fell into it.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.656
I'd wanted to be a broadcast journalist,

06:04.740 --> 06:08.744
but having the gift of gab
and being interested in movies

06:08.827 --> 06:10.662
and how these things were crafted,

06:10.746 --> 06:13.874
I started as a publicity assistant
and moved up

06:13.957 --> 06:17.211
and eventually had my own agency,
The DuVernay Agency.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.964
I opened that agency at age 27

06:21.048 --> 06:23.926
and worked on a lot of movies,
over 100 movies,

06:24.009 --> 06:26.428
and got the opportunity
to be on many sets.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.680
I was never on the set
of a woman filmmaker though,

06:29.264 --> 06:33.435
and always one of the very few Black
people on the crews as a unit publicist.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.480
But I thought I had the best job
in the whole world

06:36.563 --> 06:38.899
till I was on these sets,
and I was starting to think,

06:38.982 --> 06:43.153
"No, actually, the best job in the world
is not selling the movie.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.571
It's making the movie."

06:44.655 --> 06:49.368
And so I'd saved $50,000
working as a publicist,

06:49.451 --> 06:55.123
and I Will Follow was made
for $50,000 cash 'cause that's all I had.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.376
She gave all of that stuff away.

06:57.459 --> 07:00.295
- Call them. It's there.
- Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this?

07:00.379 --> 07:02.297
I said I wasn't gonna do this with you.

07:02.381 --> 07:06.260
It was so low, low, low, low budget.

07:06.844 --> 07:11.265
No support, no grants,
no financing, no nothing.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.891
There's more glory days ahead.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.185
You know, you're the best at what you do.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.438
But the proceeds of that film I put
into the next film, Middle of Nowhere.

07:18.522 --> 07:21.984
My client is not an active participant

07:22.067 --> 07:23.694
in any gang activity whatsoever.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.447
No official charges have been filed
at any point.

07:27.531 --> 07:31.618
I had applied to Sundance
six or seven times

07:31.702 --> 07:33.954
and was denied, denied,
denied, denied, denied.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.790
But my producing partner at the time said,

07:36.874 --> 07:39.501
"We gotta submit it to Sundance.
Like, just do it one more time."

07:39.585 --> 07:42.337
I was like, "You can do it.
I don't care anymore."

07:43.046 --> 07:45.382
Ava DuVernay for Middle of Nowhere.

07:46.216 --> 07:50.721
Of course we get in. And we don't just
get in, we get into the top category.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.390
And we don't just get in the top category,
we win "Best Director."

07:53.473 --> 07:56.393
And that's when
everything started to change.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.565
Dear Ava…

08:02.482 --> 08:07.446
My name is Dr. Keisha Blain,
and I'm a professor and author.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.699
"We want to set the world on fire."

08:11.241 --> 08:12.701
"We want freedom and justice…"

08:12.784 --> 08:15.329
"…and a chance to rebuild for ourselves.

08:15.913 --> 08:20.292
And if we must set the world on fire,
we will, like other men,

08:20.375 --> 08:22.794
die for the realization of our dreams."

08:22.878 --> 08:25.839
These are the words of Josephine Moody,

08:25.923 --> 08:29.635
a Black nationalist
who inspired the title of my book…

08:29.718 --> 08:31.220
Set the World on Fire.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.764
Dear Ava. She's famous.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.392
I've always been surrounded
by strong Black women

08:37.476 --> 08:39.852
who were the backbone of my community.

08:39.937 --> 08:43.315
My mother immigrated to New York City
from the Caribbean.

08:43.398 --> 08:46.693
She motivated me
to pursue higher education…

08:46.777 --> 08:50.405
…and to go as far as I could possibly go.

08:50.489 --> 08:55.744
Today I am a professor of history
at the University of Pittsburgh

08:55.827 --> 09:00.165
and a fellow at the Carr Center
for Human Rights Policy.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.126
"Teaching history to young people
can be quite a challenge.

09:03.710 --> 09:07.005
There are more than enough things
to be concerned about in our present,

09:07.089 --> 09:09.299
and many don't see the relevance
of learning history

09:09.383 --> 09:11.635
or how it applies to our daily lives."

09:11.718 --> 09:14.429
That's where you come in, Ava.

09:14.513 --> 09:18.308
One of the amazing things
film can do for us

09:18.392 --> 09:23.564
is reframe the past through the lens
of our modern sensibilities.

09:23.647 --> 09:28.569
It can take the stories
from being flat words on a page

09:28.652 --> 09:33.824
to a full, breathing narrative
happening in real time.

09:34.324 --> 09:38.453
I've opened so many of my lectures
with your film Selma,

09:38.537 --> 09:42.583
playing scenes featuring the women
who empowered Dr. King

09:42.666 --> 09:44.209
to continue in his work.

09:44.835 --> 09:51.175
Your ability to tell true stories with
the soul and significance they deserve

09:51.258 --> 09:58.098
is now a partner in my quest to make
the old new and alive in my classroom.

09:59.433 --> 10:03.478
Imagine the beam in my eyes
as I'm watching Queen Sugar one night

10:03.562 --> 10:05.856
and Nova mentions my book.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.567
Are you familiar with the works
of Brittney Cooper, Dr. Keisha Blain,

10:08.650 --> 10:10.110
Rebecca Traister?

10:10.194 --> 10:14.406
I immediately go to Twitter
to express my gratitude to you.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.783
You tweet back saying you're a fan.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.411
"I wish I could have told you that day,

10:19.494 --> 10:23.040
you'll never be as big a fan of mine
as I am of you.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.919
You've broken down barriers in a space
that's not always welcoming

10:27.002 --> 10:28.420
to people who look like us."

10:29.046 --> 10:31.924
We're Black women
setting the world on fire.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.385
I'm humbled to share space with you, Ava.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.055
That's fantastic.

10:39.806 --> 10:40.807
So lovely.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.395
For women filmmakers,
people of color, awards matter.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.272
They're not just shiny things.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.775
Unfortunately, that thing opens doors.

10:50.734 --> 10:55.447
That thing changes your prospects
for being financed on your next film.

10:55.948 --> 10:57.115
It's currency.

10:57.950 --> 11:01.537
It makes the powers that be take notice
to what you've done.

11:01.620 --> 11:06.375
Because just to be a Black woman making
films in your own voice isn't enough.

11:06.458 --> 11:10.379
Some institution and someone has to say,
"Oh, this is a good one."

11:12.089 --> 11:16.510
And it did help me land the next thing,
which was Selma.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.930
My cameramen are gonna be walking
and moving along the crowd.

11:20.013 --> 11:24.685
Selma was really interesting because it
was the first time that I "got a movie,"

11:24.768 --> 11:27.145
but I was the seventh or eighth director
on the film.

11:27.229 --> 11:29.147
If I wrote the script
for a certain budget,

11:29.231 --> 11:31.191
I could direct the movie.
That was the deal.

11:31.275 --> 11:34.236
'Cause they couldn't find anyone
to make the film for $20 million.

11:34.319 --> 11:40.033
I was like, "Excuse me?
Say the price again?"

11:40.784 --> 11:43.412
I'm making films on $200,000.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.747
I'll make that film on $20 million.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.793
It was a movie. It was a real movie
that I was being offered.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.881
But listen,
I don't like historical dramas.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.967
It's not the first thing I'm watching.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.636
And so when Selma came to me,

11:59.720 --> 12:04.266
I said, "I'm gonna make
a historical drama that I would watch.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.852
What are the things
that I don't like about those movies?

12:06.935 --> 12:09.563
They're so saccharine.
Everyone's a saint."

12:09.646 --> 12:10.647
You know what I mean?

12:10.731 --> 12:12.441
There's people singing gospel in the back.

12:12.524 --> 12:17.779
Like, I was like, "No gospel in this!
No gospel." Right? No saints.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.908
Well, it's about King.
Well, he wasn't a saint.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.451
He was a man.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.454
He was an ordinary man
who did extraordinary things.

12:25.537 --> 12:29.666
This local sheriff, Jim Clark,
is supposed to be bad business.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.171
Won't go down without a fight, they say.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.675
Now, since we don't fight,

12:39.635 --> 12:44.223
well, good a place to die as any, I guess.

12:45.849 --> 12:49.937
The reaction to Selma
was overwhelmingly positive by critics.

12:50.020 --> 12:53.315
It was embraced by awards bodies.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.943
It didn't win much
but got nominated a lot.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.528
I think we got to the stage one time.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.279
It was the NAACP Image Awards.

12:59.363 --> 13:02.115
If you can't win an Image Award
with Selma, then what the hell?

13:03.116 --> 13:08.580
But Oscars So White was a result
of Selma not receiving…

13:08.664 --> 13:11.166
certain nominations at the Oscars.

13:11.250 --> 13:16.255
Definitely, my years working
as a publicist made me sober

13:16.338 --> 13:18.882
about what the awards were,

13:18.966 --> 13:21.844
because I'd rolled red carpets
on my hands and knees.

13:21.927 --> 13:23.053
I'd put out the stanchions.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.097
I've called the press.
I've credentialed them.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.475
I've made sure they had their parking.
That's what I did as a publicist.

13:28.559 --> 13:31.937
So, I understand that
that is a part of the system.

13:33.564 --> 13:38.485
And so I never expected to get director
'cause I knew what the odds are.

13:39.695 --> 13:41.488
I knew it was not going to happen.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.949
People who are not familiar
with the Academy

13:44.032 --> 13:46.326
and not familiar with
how these things work

13:46.410 --> 13:49.496
had no idea and were very up in arms.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.582
The anger probably also
came from the fact that

13:51.665 --> 13:56.378
we were in the midst of the beginnings
of the Black Lives Matter movement.

13:57.296 --> 14:00.966
And at the same time that we were
in the editing room cutting Selma,

14:01.049 --> 14:02.551
Ferguson was happening.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.679
I remember being in the editing room,
cutting Selma,

14:05.762 --> 14:07.222
and Ferguson was happening.

14:07.306 --> 14:11.894
And the parallels between those two,
almost 50 years apart,

14:11.977 --> 14:15.772
being striking and stark and saddening.

14:15.856 --> 14:19.902
Turn up, don't turn down.
We do this for Mike Brown!

14:19.985 --> 14:23.739
Following the success
of the Academy Award-winning film, Selma,

14:23.822 --> 14:27.576
DuVernay maintains the focus
of racial inequality in her next film.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.872
The documentary, 13th, was a side project.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.249
Not a side project in my passion for it,

14:34.333 --> 14:38.212
but really something that I thought,
"This will be nice to have in the world,"

14:38.295 --> 14:41.340
and never thinking
it would have the impact that it's had.

14:42.090 --> 14:47.137
It started as just being a documentary
about the prison industrial complex.

14:47.221 --> 14:50.140
But as we got in, you can't tell the story
about the prison industrial complex

14:50.224 --> 14:52.851
without connecting it to
the deeply racist history

14:52.935 --> 14:54.978
of the United States of America,

14:55.062 --> 15:01.527
and what the real-world consequences
of that are on our daily life right now.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.529
Because the past is present.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.281
I mean, it's here.

15:06.365 --> 15:09.493
We're living on top of everything
that was done before.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.787
To be honest,
escalation was almost inevitable

15:11.870 --> 15:14.873
with this militarized style of policing.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.626
And so it is important
to interrogate history.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.711
Because by interrogating history,

15:19.795 --> 15:22.798
we understand more fully
what we're experiencing in the present

15:22.881 --> 15:27.886
and now have all the tools we need
to change the future if we decide to.

15:33.475 --> 15:37.062
Dear Ava, When you sat down
to conceptualize 13th,

15:37.145 --> 15:39.565
I'm sure you had many people in mind.

15:39.648 --> 15:43.402
You probably thought of
the wrongfully incarcerated men and women,

15:43.485 --> 15:45.696
Black and brown disproportionately so.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.740
"You may have even
thought about the world at large,

15:48.824 --> 15:52.035
wanting them to see America
underneath its veil."

15:52.661 --> 15:55.414
But of all the people you thought about
when making 13th,

15:55.497 --> 15:58.834
I'd be willing to bet that you
didn't realize the hundreds of children

15:58.917 --> 16:01.086
you'd be saving from incarceration.

16:01.587 --> 16:03.213
That is what you inspired, Ava.

16:03.797 --> 16:08.468
13th was a lightning bolt that electrified
four legal professionals into action,

16:08.552 --> 16:11.221
including me
and my colleagues on the bench.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.265
All African American women…

16:13.348 --> 16:16.268
"…and the youngest sitting judges
in Dallas County."

16:16.852 --> 16:17.853
Wow.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.480
As the former gang unit prosecutor,

16:20.564 --> 16:24.026
I saw a number of offenders
impacted by the criminal justice system.

16:24.109 --> 16:28.197
I then became passionate about preventing
the youth from entering that system.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.824
I worked in the public defender's office,

16:30.908 --> 16:33.076
which gave me a different perspective

16:33.160 --> 16:37.247
and made me vastly more sensitive
to the struggle of our people

16:37.331 --> 16:40.417
in my current work
on the criminal court bench.

16:42.127 --> 16:44.379
I was a teen mom
and grew up to be a lawyer

16:44.463 --> 16:47.841
specializing in domestic violence
and child abuse cases.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.468
I was well-prepared to think of both

16:49.551 --> 16:53.722
individual consequences
and the big picture as a judge.

16:53.805 --> 16:59.019
"But nothing in our collective experience
prepared us for your unshakable work."

16:59.102 --> 17:01.730
We'd known about your
filmmaking prowess before, Ava,

17:01.813 --> 17:05.358
but there was something special
that happened with your documentary, 13th.

17:05.442 --> 17:11.615
Back in 2016, Pastor Bryan L. Carter,
of Concord Church in Dallas,

17:11.698 --> 17:15.702
invited every elected official in the area
to a church service.

17:15.786 --> 17:20.207
He wanted the congregation to see
the people whom they elected to office,

17:20.290 --> 17:23.460
and inspire them to show up to the polls.

17:23.544 --> 17:29.341
To drive his point home, Pastor Carter
played a clip of 13th during the service.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.552
We were stunned.

17:31.635 --> 17:35.347
As judges,
none of the information was new to us.

17:35.430 --> 17:39.768
But the way in which you presented
the horrifying density of the facts

17:39.852 --> 17:41.854
brought everything home for us.

17:41.937 --> 17:46.275
At that moment, we could clearly see
the school-to-prison pipeline.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.236
I decided we had to do something.

17:49.319 --> 17:52.030
Together,
we formed Pipeline of Possibilities,

17:52.114 --> 17:55.701
a nonprofit organization
designed to educate students

17:55.784 --> 17:59.371
about the criminal justice system
with the hopes of preventing them

17:59.454 --> 18:01.456
from entering it in the first place.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.166
Through Pipeline of Possibilities,

18:03.250 --> 18:05.377
we target middle and high school students

18:05.460 --> 18:08.338
in neighborhoods
with high rates of incarceration,

18:08.422 --> 18:09.464
and educate them about…

18:09.548 --> 18:12.426
"…everything
in the criminal justice process."

18:12.509 --> 18:14.678
Wow, this is so important.

18:14.761 --> 18:19.183
We also build advocacy for them
and their health and careers.

18:19.266 --> 18:22.853
As young Black women, we're able
to connect with the students in ways

18:22.936 --> 18:25.105
that many judges never could.

18:25.189 --> 18:27.524
We've even had a student say to us
that she never thought

18:27.608 --> 18:31.278
she could become a judge because
she never saw one that looked like her.

18:31.361 --> 18:35.157
Ava, because of you, we're able
to raise up a generation of children

18:35.240 --> 18:37.534
who understand the law firsthand

18:37.618 --> 18:40.787
so that they may never fall victim to it
later in life.

18:40.871 --> 18:42.915
We are in loving debt to you, Ava,

18:42.998 --> 18:45.792
for reminding us of our role as judges,

18:45.876 --> 18:49.880
and for inspiring an entire community
to change the narrative.

18:50.506 --> 18:52.716
"We, Ava, honor you."

18:52.799 --> 18:54.009
Wow.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.303
That makes me emotional.

18:58.472 --> 18:59.640
That's incredible.

19:01.016 --> 19:06.021
What I'm trying to do in my films
is to show an alternative view

19:06.104 --> 19:07.523
of what you thought you know.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.777
I'm trying to undo a master narrative.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.364
There's a master narrative,
a main narrative…

19:16.949 --> 19:21.036
a top layer of story about all of us

19:21.119 --> 19:24.414
that we have believed.

19:25.082 --> 19:26.542
Whether that's Dr. King,

19:26.625 --> 19:30.712
whether that's what the criminal justice
system is, and Black history is.

19:30.796 --> 19:34.967
Whether it's who can be
a hero in a Disney movie.

19:35.592 --> 19:39.680
There is a core narrative
that we've all bought into.

19:39.763 --> 19:44.601
And in many instances,
it's wrong as it relates to Black people.

19:49.982 --> 19:53.861
When you think about When They See Us,

19:54.444 --> 19:57.322
five boys, who were known as
the Central Park Five,

19:57.406 --> 19:59.992
and what we think they are and they did.

20:00.826 --> 20:03.954
Well, let me tell you what it actually
was, not what you think it was.

20:07.541 --> 20:09.084
Why they doing us like this?

20:15.591 --> 20:17.342
What other way they ever do us?

20:19.261 --> 20:23.849
Telling stories
through a historical context allows folks,

20:23.932 --> 20:29.313
I feel, to engage with the issues
from a bit of a distance.

20:30.230 --> 20:36.111
And to perhaps go deeper than they would
if confronted with the story in the now.

20:36.195 --> 20:40.365
And so, I think it's really trying to
go beyond the pages of the history book,

20:40.449 --> 20:44.119
the headlines, what you think
you know about what prison is,

20:44.203 --> 20:46.747
but you really don't know
all that it affects,

20:46.830 --> 20:52.753
and to frame it in a way that people
are able to consider these challenges

20:53.712 --> 20:55.547
"as if" in hindsight.

20:55.631 --> 20:59.092
But really, I'm challenging them
to think about it right now.

20:59.176 --> 21:03.514
Because I know the real-world impact
of When They See Us

21:03.597 --> 21:05.933
on those five men and their families.

21:06.558 --> 21:11.188
And I also know
how instructive that film has been

21:11.271 --> 21:13.690
for folks who have watched it

21:13.774 --> 21:18.737
and not understood the deep bias
within the criminal justice system.

21:19.905 --> 21:23.575
Growing up, I knew too many people
going through it.

21:24.368 --> 21:29.998
I had experienced too many times
saying, "Where's your brother?"

21:31.166 --> 21:34.461
"He's not here. He's upstate."

21:35.629 --> 21:40.300
Too many times seeing folks there
one day and gone the next.

21:40.384 --> 21:44.638
And we don't try to help in any way.

21:44.721 --> 21:50.435
We just send people away and forget.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.105
That's how society functions.

21:53.188 --> 21:55.941
But the people
who love those people don't forget.

22:03.198 --> 22:07.619
Dear Ava,
You are a master of storytelling…

22:07.703 --> 22:10.247
"…even in the brilliant way
you title your work.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.625
I know it wasn't the choice
you started with, but When They See Us…"

22:13.709 --> 22:16.128
…was the perfect name for your series.

22:16.211 --> 22:21.091
It went so far beyond just a title.
It became a mission statement.

22:21.675 --> 22:24.469
You took all of the voyeurism
out of the prison system

22:24.553 --> 22:28.515
and showed people real young boys,
who were suffering from unjust pain.

22:29.016 --> 22:32.060
When I heard of the series
and what it was about, I waited.

22:32.144 --> 22:34.396
The story was too close to home.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.648
I knew several members
of the Central Park Five,

22:36.732 --> 22:39.902
and I seen plenty of
prison movies throughout my life.

22:39.985 --> 22:44.239
They never tell a complete and nuanced
story, so I had my reservations.

22:44.323 --> 22:49.369
"After a week, I watched.
Several times I had to press pause.

22:49.453 --> 22:52.289
I couldn't see the screen
through all the tears.

22:52.372 --> 22:56.084
Not only did you do an exceptional job
of telling their story,

22:56.168 --> 22:58.170
you were also telling my story."

22:59.505 --> 23:00.756
My name is Marlon.

23:00.839 --> 23:03.300
Growing up,
those prison movies I mentioned

23:03.383 --> 23:07.513
usually portray the people in prison
in sensationalized, dehumanizing ways,

23:07.596 --> 23:11.141
which perpetuates the belief
that only terrible people go to prison,

23:11.225 --> 23:12.309
the worst of the worst.

23:12.392 --> 23:16.188
As a kid, I believed those stories.
Until I was one of them.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.690
I didn't grow up around guns.

23:18.774 --> 23:21.777
But after years of exposure to the many
toxic things happening in Crown Heights,

23:21.860 --> 23:26.406
back when I was young, I finally thought
to myself, "I might need this."

23:26.907 --> 23:29.826
I was convicted of armed robbery
and attempted murder.

23:29.910 --> 23:32.621
I was in prison from the age of 19 to 30.

23:32.704 --> 23:36.333
And I saw quickly just how false
the perception of prison truly was.

23:36.416 --> 23:37.543
Yes, there was some violence.

23:37.626 --> 23:40.671
And yes, many of the people inside
committed crimes.

23:40.754 --> 23:44.216
"But the crimes they committed
were not the totality of their being.

23:44.299 --> 23:46.760
I want my story to be a life lesson."

23:46.844 --> 23:50.931
And I've never had a tool to support me
so powerfully as your films.

23:51.974 --> 23:55.310
Your portrayals not only expose
hidden truth we often overlook,

23:55.394 --> 23:57.688
but they also create empathy,

23:57.771 --> 24:01.316
a vastly under-nurtured skill
in our culture.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.695
I got my degree in criminal justice
while I was still incarcerated.

24:04.778 --> 24:06.530
Then I spent the last five years inside,

24:06.613 --> 24:09.366
working as the head
of the Transitional Services center,

24:09.449 --> 24:12.369
equipping other incarcerated men
with the tools

24:12.452 --> 24:17.332
to reintegrate and build a life
when they return to the world outside.

24:19.751 --> 24:22.462
I've been out of prison for 11 years now.

24:22.546 --> 24:25.883
I've held positions
in multiple social justice organizations,

24:26.633 --> 24:29.178
become a board member
of various nonprofits,

24:29.261 --> 24:32.014
earned a degree
in organizational behavior from NYU,

24:32.097 --> 24:35.309
and written articles that have appeared
in Ebony, USA Today,

24:35.392 --> 24:37.394
HuffPost and other publications.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.730
I wouldn't be the messenger I've become

24:39.813 --> 24:43.692
without the allyship
and examples of storytellers like you.

24:44.484 --> 24:48.989
"Thank you for remaining authentic,
for using your platform and influence

24:49.072 --> 24:51.575
to move culture forward…"

24:51.658 --> 24:55.704
And for helping people from all around
the world to truly see a person like me.

25:00.125 --> 25:04.505
Queen Sugar was something
that was proposed to me to do.

25:04.588 --> 25:08.258
And there are a lot of different people
who will propose things for you,

25:08.342 --> 25:11.345
but when Oprah proposes something to you,

25:11.428 --> 25:15.933
you listen a little bit more
than you might if someone else did.

25:16.016 --> 25:21.980
And so, I read the book,
and I just saw a gorgeous, normal family.

25:22.064 --> 25:26.193
And I thought, "This is an opportunity
to chronicle Black family life

25:26.276 --> 25:30.197
in a way that's not steeped in spectacle,
not steeped in humor."

25:30.280 --> 25:32.241
I love spectacle. I love humor.

25:32.324 --> 25:34.159
This is just a family drama.

25:34.243 --> 25:38.372
It's the same thing as a This Is Us,
or a Thirtysomething or what have you.

25:38.455 --> 25:42.501
It's just with folks that are not usually
centered in those narratives.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.211
Mom, I'm not going to Harvard.

25:45.963 --> 25:51.969
I'm gonna study art and political science
and pursue a career in photography.

25:52.052 --> 25:55.430
Queen Sugar is a liberated territory.

25:56.014 --> 25:58.225
It is the kingdom of women directors.

25:58.976 --> 26:01.103
And it's beautiful.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.815
But I got a call from
a very good friend in the DGA.

26:04.898 --> 26:08.360
He said, "Ava, I just want to let you know
this whole thing that you're doing

26:08.443 --> 26:11.530
about only hiring women directors
for Queen Sugar,

26:11.613 --> 26:13.240
it's not going over too well in the Guild.

26:13.824 --> 26:16.952
People are feeling excluded."

26:17.035 --> 26:19.454
I said, "By people, do you mean men?"

26:19.538 --> 26:23.792
He said, "Yeah, they're feeling like
why can't they have the job?"

26:23.876 --> 26:28.088
And I was like, "Okay.
Well, can you ask them why for,

26:28.172 --> 26:30.132
I don't know, the last 75 years,

26:30.215 --> 26:34.052
the majority of sets
have had all-male directorial teams?

26:34.136 --> 26:36.972
Because I feel not included
in those teams."

26:37.055 --> 26:40.017
"If we're going to talk about
this one show that has all women,

26:40.100 --> 26:44.021
then you have to talk about the hundreds
of shows that have had all men.

26:44.104 --> 26:46.148
Do you want to have that conversation?"

26:47.524 --> 26:49.860
No. Nobody wants to
have that conversation.

26:49.943 --> 26:54.615
But if a part of your priorities
is not thinking outside of yourself,

26:54.698 --> 26:57.409
it's problematic.

26:57.492 --> 27:01.455
And when that has happened
year after year,

27:01.538 --> 27:05.792
decade after decade,
generation after generation,

27:05.876 --> 27:07.377
you get to a place

27:07.461 --> 27:12.966
where folks feel like their privilege is…

27:14.134 --> 27:15.344
is a birthright.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.937
Dear Ava, My name is Dominique,

27:25.020 --> 27:30.150
and I currently work as deputy director
of a national nonprofit organization

27:30.234 --> 27:33.153
where we work to promote
economic security for women of color.

27:34.363 --> 27:38.450
"My passion is to disrupt
systems and policies

27:38.534 --> 27:43.914
that disenfranchise and limit access
to economic equality for women of color."

27:43.997 --> 27:46.333
I also create for BlackHer,

27:46.416 --> 27:50.754
an online publication
geared towards educating Black women

27:50.838 --> 27:52.965
to grow their economic
and political power…

27:53.048 --> 27:58.554
"…and equip other women with the most
powerful tool we have: the truth."

27:58.637 --> 27:59.638
Amen.

27:59.721 --> 28:02.766
Women of color
are the most disproportionately

28:02.850 --> 28:06.353
represented when it comes to
low-wage jobs and student loan debt.

28:06.436 --> 28:09.481
You've done such a poignant job
of depicting this dynamic

28:09.565 --> 28:11.275
in your show, Queen Sugar,

28:11.358 --> 28:14.736
a story about building Black wealth
told through a Southern family…

28:14.820 --> 28:16.697
"…matriarchal at that,

28:16.780 --> 28:19.283
fighting through issues that are universal

28:19.366 --> 28:22.202
because they're so
three-dimensionally specific.

28:22.286 --> 28:24.913
Queen Sugar sits so deeply with me…"

28:24.997 --> 28:27.749
…because the Bordelon family
resembles my own.

28:28.667 --> 28:32.004
I spent my childhood summers
in the river parishes of Louisiana,

28:32.087 --> 28:33.839
where my father grew up.

28:33.922 --> 28:37.926
But I grew up in western Maryland,
which came with its own obstacles.

28:38.010 --> 28:40.846
I was often the only Black student
in my classes,

28:40.929 --> 28:43.891
and my family was the only Black family
in our neighborhood.

28:44.683 --> 28:47.436
However, my grandmother gifted me
with a sense of pride

28:47.519 --> 28:49.855
in my identity as a young Black woman.

28:49.938 --> 28:52.691
She taught me lessons
of trailblazing Black women

28:52.774 --> 28:57.279
such as Madam C. J. Walker,
the first self-made woman millionaire.

28:57.362 --> 29:00.657
Although I grew up with a certain
amount of economic stability,

29:00.741 --> 29:03.160
I was also exposed
to the racial inequities

29:03.243 --> 29:05.621
in both the North and the South.

29:05.704 --> 29:09.208
And I became passionate about
challenging the oppressive status quo.

29:10.209 --> 29:12.794
Ava, thank you for inspiring women

29:12.878 --> 29:16.381
to reach for the impossible
and close the gaps.

29:16.465 --> 29:20.344
Wow. "Women like you and my grandmother…"

29:20.427 --> 29:22.387
…are the reason I joined this battle.

29:25.724 --> 29:29.269
Anyone who wants to work hard,
anyone who wants to go through the process

29:29.353 --> 29:32.731
and be great at their craft,
should have a place in our industry.

29:33.690 --> 29:36.485
We want to disrupt the idea of inclusion

29:37.277 --> 29:39.780
because inclusion is paint.

29:40.781 --> 29:44.826
Paint to fix the house
that's fallen apart.

29:44.910 --> 29:48.205
But the girding,
the architecture of it is flawed.

29:48.288 --> 29:52.543
So, what if you built a new house
that had all kinds of doors

29:52.626 --> 29:55.045
for all kinds of people to walk in

29:55.128 --> 29:57.881
and didn't have a secret passageway
for some people?

29:58.632 --> 30:03.762
What if it was just a sturdy new structure
with the proper foundation?

30:05.973 --> 30:09.184
You have to be intentional
about the things you care about.

30:10.143 --> 30:16.275
Where the things that you believe,
you behave that way in every instance.

30:16.358 --> 30:19.528
Because it will have a ripple effect
in the world.

30:19.611 --> 30:22.698
You've inspired me to make
bold moves toward my mission, Ava.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.533
Through our work,

30:24.616 --> 30:27.619
we can slowly but surely
change the world from the inside out.

30:28.245 --> 30:30.581
Thank you, Ava, for your courage.

30:31.248 --> 30:33.667
I've been lucky enough to see

30:33.750 --> 30:37.212
that art can change things…

30:39.256 --> 30:42.384
…and may change
the way one person treats another

30:42.467 --> 30:44.803
or sees another or sees themselves.

30:44.887 --> 30:47.389
May we continue in the fight together.

30:47.472 --> 30:49.850
Sincerely, Dominique.

30:49.933 --> 30:51.518
Judge Amber Givens.

30:51.602 --> 30:53.145
Judge Shequitta Kelly.

30:53.228 --> 30:54.813
Judge Lisa Green.

30:54.897 --> 30:56.732
Judge Stephanie Huff.

30:56.815 --> 30:59.860
Sincerely, Keisha.

30:59.943 --> 31:02.696
In gratitude, Marlon.
