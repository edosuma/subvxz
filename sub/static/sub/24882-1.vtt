Grover, are you sure
you can carry all that?

01:24.967 --> 01:26.567
- Yes, I can.
- Here, let me help you.

01:26.567 --> 01:28.166
No, no, no need, dear Nina.

01:28.166 --> 01:31.333
I have many years
of experience working
as a waiter.

01:31.333 --> 01:33.266
Whoa! Oh!

01:33.266 --> 01:37.633
- Uh-oh! Are you okay?
- It is okay.

01:37.633 --> 01:41.467
I also have many years
of experience picking up
things I dropped.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.300
Ugh. What a mess.

with those napkins.

01:55.934 --> 01:57.967
Set table!

01:57.967 --> 02:02.633
Hmm. Something's missing.
Oh! I know!

02:02.633 --> 02:08.467
This is such a special day,
I think we need
a big bouquet!

02:08.467 --> 02:11.467
Zippity zap!
Ha, ha, ha!

02:11.467 --> 02:12.967
Those are
beautiful, Abby.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.767
Aw. Thank you, Nina.

02:15.767 --> 02:18.333
This is such
a superspecial day.

02:18.333 --> 02:21.000
- I'm so thankful.
- Oh, hi.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.500
Today,
we're celebrating Thanksgiving
on "Sesame Street,"

02:23.500 --> 02:25.300
and everybody's gonna be
bringing something to eat.

02:25.300 --> 02:28.233
Okay, okay, people.

02:28.233 --> 02:31.533
I need my pilgrims,
my pumpkin, my turkey.

02:31.533 --> 02:34.033
- Where are you?
- Oh, oh, oh.
One turkey coming up!

02:34.033 --> 02:35.834
- Gobble, gobble! Bbblll!
- Very nice.

02:35.834 --> 02:37.767
Ha, ha, ha!
Come on, pilgrims!

02:37.767 --> 02:41.433
- Yeah! This is gonna be fun.
- Come on, it's dress rehearsal
time!

02:41.433 --> 02:43.166
It's gonna be
an interesting Thanksgiving.

02:43.166 --> 02:46.133
- Uh, Nina? Hi, hi.
- Oh, hi, Cookie Monster.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.867
Uh, could you remind me again

02:47.867 --> 02:49.767
what Thanksgiving
all about?

02:49.767 --> 02:51.133
Oh, yeah, of course.

02:51.133 --> 02:53.400
So, Thanksgiving is when
you get together with friends

02:53.400 --> 02:56.934
and family to give thanks
for all the wonderful things
in our lives.

02:56.934 --> 03:00.000
You mean like cookies?
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

03:00.000 --> 03:01.467
Me gonna go make
some cookies!

03:01.467 --> 03:02.834
Ha, ha, ha!

03:02.834 --> 03:05.133
- Places, places, everyone!
- ( Elmo snickering )

03:05.133 --> 03:06.567
The clock is ticking,

03:06.567 --> 03:09.200
and we need to rehearse
this wonderful  song

03:09.200 --> 03:11.633
which I have written
for this great occasion.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.533
( cheering )

03:13.533 --> 03:18.000
Yuck! They're all so jolly
today, I'm gonna need earplugs.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.333
Okay, let's go--
oh, where's our guitar player?

03:21.333 --> 03:23.166
We're missing
our guitar player!

03:23.166 --> 03:25.567
Sorry, sorry, Prairie.
Oh! Very sorry!

03:25.567 --> 03:26.867
Rosita, you're late.

03:26.867 --> 03:29.200
Yeah. I was late
because I was helping my abuela

03:29.200 --> 03:30.600
cook for
the Thanksgiving dinner.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.667
Yes, that's very nice.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.233
Wait till
you taste it all, Prairie.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.734
- Uh-huh.
- She is the best cook ever.

03:35.734 --> 03:38.567
Yes, well,
that is terrific, Rosita,
but we have to do this.

03:38.567 --> 03:40.734
- Okay, everybody!
Are we ready?
- Okay, ready.

03:40.734 --> 03:42.233
- All ready, Prairie.
- This costume's itchy.

03:42.233 --> 03:43.800
- ( chatter )
- Okay, here we go!

03:43.800 --> 03:46.100

04:07.333 --> 04:08.567
Yes, Rosita, yes?

04:08.567 --> 04:10.667
Shouldn't there
be other foods in our song

04:10.667 --> 04:14.600
besides turkey, pumpkin,
and, uh-- oh--

04:14.600 --> 04:16.100
whatever Bert is.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.600
A yam's what I "Yam."
Ah, ah, ah!

04:18.600 --> 04:19.800
Oh. That's a sweet potato.

04:19.800 --> 04:20.867
- Sweet potato.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:20.867 --> 04:23.533
Oh, what other foods
were you thinking about?

04:23.533 --> 04:27.033
Oh, maybe some tamales,
some frijoles.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.333
- Tamales?
- Mm-hmm.

04:28.333 --> 04:29.800
- Frijoles?
- Yes!

04:29.800 --> 04:33.133
Oh, well,
I've never had those foods
at Thanksgiving.

04:33.133 --> 04:37.333
Oh, uh-- not even
mole or tortillas?

04:37.333 --> 04:38.767
Oh, no.

04:38.767 --> 04:40.100
No, see,
those foods aren't part

04:40.100 --> 04:41.867
of my family tradition.

04:41.867 --> 04:43.567
Uh, your what?

04:43.567 --> 04:47.700
- Tradition!
What people always  do...
- Oh.

04:47.700 --> 04:51.533
...and my family Thanksgiving
tradition is eating turkey

04:51.533 --> 04:55.000
and sweet potatoes
and pumpkin pie!

04:55.000 --> 04:57.467
Oh, yum!

04:57.467 --> 05:01.500
- Rosita, aquí estoy.
- Hola, abuela.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.133
It is all ready.

05:03.133 --> 05:07.667
Mija,  mole,
frijoles refritos, tortillas,

05:07.667 --> 05:10.233
y  my special
Thanksgiving tamales.

05:10.233 --> 05:12.734
Mmm, what's that smell?

05:12.734 --> 05:16.433
Smell? Ah, sí. ¿Les gusta?
You like it?

05:16.433 --> 05:19.767
Yeah! Elmo loves it!
Oh, it smells different.

05:19.767 --> 05:23.900
Yes, but it is not
very "Thanksgivingingingy."

05:23.900 --> 05:25.500
What did your abuela make?

05:25.500 --> 05:27.367
- Yeah, what'd she make,
Rosita?
- ( chatter )

05:27.367 --> 05:29.000
I'll show you later!

05:29.000 --> 05:31.333
Pero,  Rosita.
¿Qué pasa?

05:31.333 --> 05:32.867
What happened?

05:32.867 --> 05:35.467
- Rosita, we need
to keep rehearsing!
- Rosita.

05:35.467 --> 05:40.834
Oh, dear.
My Thanksgiving song
will never be ready.

05:40.834 --> 05:41.734
Oh!

05:43.633 --> 05:44.734
Oh.

05:46.300 --> 05:49.133
( sighs )
Maybe Prairie's right.

05:49.133 --> 05:52.667
I guess this is not
Thanksgiving food.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.567
I better hide you.

05:54.567 --> 05:56.734
- Hi, Rosita.
- Oh, Alan!

05:56.734 --> 05:58.333
Oh, are you okay?

05:58.333 --> 06:01.100
Oh, sure.
Just, um, fine. Heh.

06:01.100 --> 06:03.633
You know what?
This is gonna be
the best Thanksgiving ever.

06:03.633 --> 06:06.967
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Um, is that
your abuela's food?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.567
- Um, yes. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, you know what?

06:09.567 --> 06:12.767
I bet she made
something really  special
and delicious.

06:12.767 --> 06:13.800
- Heh.
- You mind if I see it?

06:13.800 --> 06:15.467
Oh, uh, sorry, Alan.

06:15.467 --> 06:18.333
Uh, you can't peek yet,
but, um, you know what?

06:18.333 --> 06:20.767
It will be
a big surprise later on.

06:20.767 --> 06:24.133
- See you!
- A big surprise?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.967
Well,
now I'm really curious.

06:25.967 --> 06:27.300
Ho, ho!

06:27.300 --> 06:28.767
- I love this little leaf...
- ( chattering )

06:28.767 --> 06:29.767
...turkey we made.

06:29.767 --> 06:32.233
Yeah, Zoe!
Ha, ha, ha!

06:32.233 --> 06:34.734
Yeah, but we definitely need
some more decorations

06:34.734 --> 06:36.567
for the Thanksgiving table.

06:36.567 --> 06:37.633
Both:
Hmm.

06:37.633 --> 06:40.200
Oh, how about
something really  big

06:40.200 --> 06:42.166
for the head of the table?

06:42.166 --> 06:44.600
- That's a great idea, Zoe!
- Ha, ha, ha!

06:44.600 --> 06:48.533
Hmm. Oh!
Will wonders never cease?

06:48.533 --> 06:51.166
Our table needs
a centerpiece.

06:51.166 --> 06:55.000
- Zippity zap!
- Whoa! Oh!

06:55.000 --> 06:56.700
This is really big.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.800
- I'm gonna put it
at the head of the table.
- Sure is.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.934
Good idea!

06:59.934 --> 07:02.967
Oh, boy.
Oh, hi, Rosita.

07:02.967 --> 07:07.700
- Oh, hi, Abby.
- Isn't Thanksgiving magical?
Ha, ha, ha!

07:07.700 --> 07:08.967
Abby, uh, wait.

07:08.967 --> 07:11.200
- What?
- Um, um, have you ever

07:11.200 --> 07:14.700
done a food changing
magic trick?

07:14.700 --> 07:16.400
Um, well, what do you mean?

07:16.400 --> 07:18.633
Yeah, you know,
like changing beans

07:18.633 --> 07:24.066
and tortillas into
Thanksgiving food
like pumpkin pie?

07:24.066 --> 07:25.867
I can change things
into pumpkins,

07:25.867 --> 07:30.433
but, uh-- ha, ha--
pumpkin pies are way  trickier.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.266
- Could you please try?
- Huh?

07:32.266 --> 07:34.834
Please, please.
It's all right here.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.033
Oh, well,
I guess I could try.

07:37.033 --> 07:39.066
Oh, thank you.
Muchas gracias.  Here.

07:39.066 --> 07:40.400
Oh, wait a sec.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.433
Rosita,
is something the matter?

07:42.433 --> 07:45.433
Abuela:
¿Rosita, dónde estas?

07:45.433 --> 07:49.900
- Oh, I got to go, Abby.
Adiós!
- But wait, Rosita.

07:49.900 --> 07:53.133
Hmm. That was strange.

07:53.133 --> 07:56.133
Ha! But whatever she was
carrying in that basket--

07:56.133 --> 07:59.767
( sniffs )
sure smelled yummy!

07:59.767 --> 08:00.667
Ha, ha, ha!

08:01.767 --> 08:03.066
Ah, there we go.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.567
All dressed
and ready to go.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.367
- Oh, hi, Rosita!
- Oh, hi, Big Bird.

08:07.367 --> 08:08.967
Are you ready
for Thanksgiving?

08:08.967 --> 08:11.166
- Uh.
- Well, I am. You know what?
I'm so proud.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.767
I made something special
for Thanksgiving.

08:13.767 --> 08:16.266
I bet it's got
turkey or pumpkin

08:16.266 --> 08:18.367
or sweet potato, right?

08:18.367 --> 08:23.166
Not at all.
It's bird seed cake!
Ha, ha, ha!

08:23.166 --> 08:26.166
Just like
my granny bird always made
for our thanksgivings.

08:26.166 --> 08:29.133
I thought you have
to eat those other things.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.734
Prairie said that
is a-- a, um--

08:31.734 --> 08:34.433
- A tradition?
- A tradition, yes.

08:34.433 --> 08:37.100
- Well, every family
has their own...
- Mm-hmm.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.667
...traditions
to celebrate Thanksgiving.

08:39.667 --> 08:42.233
My tradition just happens
to be bird seed cake

08:42.233 --> 08:44.600
- or-- or anything
with bird seed.
- Oh.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.867
Ha, ha, ha!
Ooh. What are you bringing?

08:47.867 --> 08:49.467
Oh. Oh. Heh.

08:49.467 --> 08:52.400
My abuela made
what we always have
for Thanksgiving.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.633
Yeah. Um, mole,
tamales, tortillas.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.200
Yeah,
that's my family tradition.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.400
Well, I love that tradition.
That sounds great.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.533
You do?

09:03.533 --> 09:06.500
Sure. You know,
I love trying new foods,

09:06.500 --> 09:08.200
and I know everyone
else will, too.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.467
And then
you'll get to share
your tradition with us.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.000
Oh, that's great.
I would love to do that, yes.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.400
Abuela:
Rosita!

09:16.400 --> 09:18.033
¿Dónde estas?

09:18.033 --> 09:19.233
That's my abuela.
Ha, ha, ha!

09:19.233 --> 09:20.700
Oh, well, then,
let's go share

09:20.700 --> 09:22.200
my bird seed cake

09:22.200 --> 09:24.300
- and your abuela's food
with everybody!
- Mm-hmm. Yes!

09:24.300 --> 09:25.600
Yes, let's do it!

09:25.600 --> 09:26.967
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on!

09:26.967 --> 09:27.867
Heh, heh, heh!

09:29.166 --> 09:31.567
- Elmo: Oh, yummy!
- ( clamoring )

09:32.934 --> 09:36.166
Wow, everything you made
looks delicious, Abuela.

09:36.166 --> 09:39.367
- Sí. Riquisimo.
- Muchas gracias.

09:39.367 --> 09:43.633
Oh, boy,
and here I was so worried
that no one would like to eat

09:43.633 --> 09:46.934
Abuela's dishes
because they're not
their family tradition.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.166
( all agreeing )

09:48.166 --> 09:49.734
Everybody has
a different tradition.

09:49.734 --> 09:51.400
- Elmo: Uh-huh.
- Yeah, my family
came from Cuba,

09:51.400 --> 09:54.000
so I brought two things
that we always had
at Thanksgiving.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.900
- Really?
- Yeah, plantains
and yuca frita.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.100
All:
Wow!

09:58.100 --> 10:00.266
And, you know,
my family's Japanese-American,

10:00.266 --> 10:04.233
so we had turkey
and cranberry sauce,
but usually

10:04.233 --> 10:08.333
with a side of-- ta-da--
sushi and sashimi!

10:08.333 --> 10:10.900
All:
Wow!

10:10.900 --> 10:13.333
And what's more,
the pilgrims who celebrated

10:13.333 --> 10:16.834
the very first Thanksgiving
also tasted new foods

10:16.834 --> 10:19.166
because they had never
seen a pumpkin

10:19.166 --> 10:21.166
or a sweet potato.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.166
Alan's right.

10:22.166 --> 10:23.867
Yeah, so in a way,
having all

10:23.867 --> 10:26.900
these different kinds of foods
is a perfect Thanksgiving.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.500
Oh, this could be our new
Sesame Street tradition!

10:29.500 --> 10:31.367
That's a great idea!

10:31.367 --> 10:35.100
Um, you know,
I've never had these foods
for Thanksgiving.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.600
Oh, well, why don't you
try some, Prairie?

10:36.600 --> 10:37.700
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.100
- Elmo: Yeah.
- Just a nibble.

10:39.100 --> 10:43.066
- Go for it!
- Nina: All righty.

10:43.066 --> 10:46.100
Mmm! Oh, that's good!

10:46.100 --> 10:49.400
This is a nice tradition
of-- oh, no.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.700
- Oh, dear.
- All: What?

10:50.700 --> 10:53.233
I have to rewrite
my Thanksgiving song!

10:53.233 --> 10:54.867
I'll be right back! Oh!

10:55.967 --> 10:57.867
Oh, brother.

10:57.867 --> 11:01.600
I just hope they chew fast
so I can get all my trash.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.500
Ugh.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.633
All right,
I have written new words

11:05.633 --> 11:06.867
to my song.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.667
Rosita, would you like
to come to sing it with me?

11:08.667 --> 11:10.000
Oh, claro que sí.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.834
Okay, it's new words
with the same music,
all right?

11:11.834 --> 11:14.600

17:18.834 --> 17:20.500
Hello there,
Mr. Farmer Guy.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.266
Uh, can you
help us, please?

17:22.266 --> 17:23.533
We need apples.

17:23.533 --> 17:25.400
Hello,
Cookie Monster and Gonger.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.767
You've come
to the right place.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.333
I have lots of apples here,

17:28.333 --> 17:30.100
and I can tell you
everything you need
to know about them.

17:31.567 --> 17:35.233
Apples are a type of fruit
that grow on trees.

17:35.233 --> 17:38.734
There are lots
of different kinds of apples.

17:38.734 --> 17:42.100
Granny Smith apples
are green.

17:42.100 --> 17:45.100
There are lots
of red apples

17:45.100 --> 17:48.734
like Pink Lady
and Red Delicious.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.767
Once the fruit is ripe
and ready to eat, the apples

17:51.767 --> 17:55.100
are picked by hand
and placed into bags.

17:58.233 --> 18:02.834
Then the apples are sorted
and placed into bins.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.333
Those bins are then sent
to grocery stores...

18:08.934 --> 18:10.834
farmers markets...

18:12.834 --> 18:14.200
and fruit stands...

18:16.266 --> 18:21.934
where people can buy them
for a healthy anytime snack
or delicious sometimes food

18:21.934 --> 18:23.934
like apple pie.

18:23.934 --> 18:26.000
I hope this helps.
Good luck.

you guys.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.800
Ha, ha, ha!

21:21.800 --> 21:25.100
Boy, Elmo wants to learn
all about Thanksgiving.

21:25.100 --> 21:28.567
Oh, let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

21:28.567 --> 21:33.166
- Let's call her together.
- All: ♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:33.166 --> 21:35.700
( playing "Elmo's Song" )

21:35.700 --> 21:36.967
Hi, Elmo!

21:36.967 --> 21:40.100
Look. I'm dressed
like a pilgrim.

21:40.100 --> 21:43.834
Wow! Oh, that's perfect,
Smartie, because Elmo wants

21:43.834 --> 21:46.333
to learn
all about Thanksgiving!

21:46.333 --> 21:49.300
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:49.300 --> 21:52.500
All:
We look it up!

21:52.500 --> 21:55.300
Searching for Thanksgiving.
Here we go!

21:57.367 --> 22:02.233
Thanksgiving is a holiday
when family and friends
get together for a meal.

22:02.233 --> 22:06.100
People bring
all kinds of food
like turkey, stuffing,

22:06.100 --> 22:10.100
and my favorite,
pumpkin pie.

22:10.100 --> 22:13.867
It's a time for sharing food
and being kind to others.

22:13.867 --> 22:16.066
On Thanksgiving,
people give thanks

22:16.066 --> 22:18.133
for all the things
they're grateful for.

22:19.533 --> 22:20.834
Aw.

22:20.834 --> 22:23.967
So, what are you
thankful for, Elmo?

22:23.967 --> 22:27.900
Well, Elmo's thankful
for lots and lots of things.

22:27.900 --> 22:31.200
Oh, especially friends
like Smartie.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.100
Aw. Me, too, Elmo.
Ha, ha, ha!

22:34.100 --> 22:36.967
- Yeah.
- Happy Thanksgiving, Elmo!

22:36.967 --> 22:39.567
Oh. Happy Thanksgiving!
See you later!

22:39.567 --> 22:41.166
Ha, ha, ha!

22:41.166 --> 22:44.834
Hey. That gives
Elmo an idea.

22:44.834 --> 22:47.633
Oh, ho!
Let's play a game together.

22:47.633 --> 22:50.166
Yeah-eah-eah!
Come on, come on!

22:50.166 --> 22:51.467
Ha, ha, ha!

22:57.100 --> 23:00.734
Look. This family
is having Thanksgiving dinner.

23:00.734 --> 23:03.734
Boy, Elmo wonders if
we can find the pie that has

23:03.734 --> 23:06.433
enough slices for everybody.

23:06.433 --> 23:10.233
First, let's count
how many people there are.

23:10.233 --> 23:13.333
All:
One, two, three,

23:13.333 --> 23:16.367
four, five, six!

23:16.367 --> 23:19.800
Elmo:
Six people altogether!

23:19.800 --> 23:25.100
So, which pie
has enough slices
for everybody?

23:25.100 --> 23:30.166
Is it this one?
It has one, two, three slices.

23:31.266 --> 23:32.333
Girl:
No!

23:32.333 --> 23:34.433
Not everyone
has a slice.

23:34.433 --> 23:36.734
Elmo:
Oh. Well, how about this pie?

23:36.734 --> 23:40.033
It has one, two, three,

23:40.033 --> 23:43.333
four, five, six slices.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.567
Boy:
That's right.

23:44.567 --> 23:47.233
There's a slice
for each person.

23:47.233 --> 23:49.166
Elmo:
Yay, we did it!

23:49.166 --> 23:51.500
Happy Thanksgiving,
everybody!

23:52.600 --> 23:55.233
Boy, Elmo loves Thanksgiving.

23:55.233 --> 23:59.066
Oh, and that makes
Elmo wonder even more.

23:59.066 --> 24:01.967
What does Mr. Noodle do
on Thanksgiving?

24:01.967 --> 24:04.266
Hey, let's ask him, okay?

24:04.266 --> 24:09.133
- ♪ Hey, Mr. Noodle ♪
- Kids: ♪ Mr. Noodle ♪

24:09.133 --> 24:11.200
Hi, Mr. Noodle.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.600
Mr. Noodle,
Elmo was wondering.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.433
Do you celebrate Thanksgiving?

24:16.533 --> 24:18.300
You do?
Oh, ho, ho!

24:18.300 --> 24:21.266
- Show us how you celebrate.
- Kids: Yeah! Show us how!

24:21.266 --> 24:23.133
Elmo:
Where's he going?

24:23.133 --> 24:26.900
- What? Mr. Noodle!
- Girl: That's
a birthday cake.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.333
- ( blowing party favor )
- Elmo: That's not
Thanksgiving.

24:29.333 --> 24:31.467
That's how
you celebrate a birthday!

24:31.467 --> 24:34.533
Try again, Mr. Noodle.
Oh, nice cake, though.

24:34.533 --> 24:36.367
Boy:
He's wearing a costume!

24:36.367 --> 24:38.633
Elmo:
Is that how
you celebrate Thanksgiving?

24:38.633 --> 24:40.500
Boy #2: That's how
you celebrate Halloween.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.200
He's going
trick-or-treating.

24:42.200 --> 24:45.667
Elmo: Mr. Noodle,
that's how you dress
for Halloween.

24:45.667 --> 24:49.066
Show us how
you celebrate Thanksgiving,
Mr. Noodle.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.433
Oh, he's having
Thanksgiving dinner.

24:53.433 --> 24:54.700
Girl #2:
That's right!

24:54.700 --> 24:55.900
Elmo:
That's right, Mr. Noodle.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.600
Now you're doing it.
Good job!

24:58.600 --> 25:01.533
Thank you for showing us how
to celebrate Thanksgiving,
Mr. Noodle.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.967
