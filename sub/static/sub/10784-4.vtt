00:01.667 --> 00:02.667
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:02.667 --> 00:05.708
OH, MY GOD.

00:05.708 --> 00:06.458
BUT I'LL BE
WORKING LATE.
MEET ME HERE LATER.

00:06.458 --> 00:08.417
SIXISH?

00:08.417 --> 00:10.041
WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?

00:10.041 --> 00:11.458
YOU.

00:11.458 --> 00:13.750
DO YOU THINK
MY MOM'S SLEEPING
WITH HER CO-ANCHOR?

00:17.917 --> 00:20.750
MRS. LEERY, I KNOW.

00:21.792 --> 00:23.291
DOES DAWSON KNOW?

00:23.291 --> 00:25.291
KNOW WHAT?
HOW TO DANCE.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.125
I WANNA BE YOUR
BOY ADVENTURE.

00:27.125 --> 00:28.792
SO I'M INTERESTED.

00:43.083 --> 00:45.375
OH, GOD, SHE'S PERFECT.

00:45.375 --> 00:46.125
PERFECT?

00:46.125 --> 00:48.375
DAWSON, YOU
DISAPPOINT ME.

00:48.375 --> 00:51.875
COME ON, LOOK AT HER.
THOSE EYES, THAT HAIR.

00:51.875 --> 00:55.959
I GRANT YOU THAT
THE GIRL HAS CERTAIN
PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES,

00:55.959 --> 00:58.708
BUT NOTHING SO
ORIGINAL OR MYSTERIOUS
TO WARRANT PERFECTION.

00:58.708 --> 01:00.208
OK, EASY.

01:00.208 --> 01:01.959
A FACE LIKE THAT
LEAVES NOTHING TO
THE IMAGINATION.

01:01.959 --> 01:04.125
THE WELL-MAINTAINED
GOOD LOOKS

01:04.125 --> 01:05.000
OF AN UPPER-MIDDLE CLASS
NEW YORKER--

01:05.000 --> 01:07.041
THERE'S
NO MYSTERY THERE.

01:07.041 --> 01:08.542
I CAN SEE
HER ENTIRE FUTURE
IN THAT FACE.

01:08.542 --> 01:09.750
REALLY?

01:09.750 --> 01:11.041
YEAH.

01:11.041 --> 01:13.291
IN 3 YEARS,
HER ABOVE-AVERAGE
S.A.T. SCORES

01:13.291 --> 01:14.208
WILL GRANT HER
ADMISSION

01:14.208 --> 01:15.875
INTO A SMALL
LIBERAL ARTS
COLLEGE,

01:15.875 --> 01:16.792
SOMEWHERE
IN NEW ENGLAND

01:16.792 --> 01:20.000
WHERE SHE'LL MAJOR
IN...ART HISTORY,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.875
BEFORE RETURNING TO
MANHATTAN TO MARRY
A BOND TRADER

01:22.875 --> 01:24.583
SHE MEETS SOME
SATURDAY AFTERNOON

01:24.583 --> 01:26.500
AT AN AMERICA'S CUP
WATCHING PARTY.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.041
WITHIN A YEAR, THEY
MOVE TO SUBURBAN
CONNECTICUT,

01:29.041 --> 01:31.208
REFURBISH
AN OLD FARM HOUSE,

01:31.208 --> 01:33.458
AND RAISE
3 NEUROTICALLY
PERFECT CHILDREN.

01:33.458 --> 01:36.500
YOU'VE PUT QUITE A BIT
OF THOUGHT INTO THIS.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.083
NOT REALLY. IT'S
JUST SO OBVIOUS.

01:38.083 --> 01:41.083
WELL, NOSTRADAMUS,
I THINK I'D PREFER

01:41.083 --> 01:42.834
TO LET JEN
SURPRISE ME, OK?

01:42.834 --> 01:45.417
SUIT YOURSELF.
JUST TRYING TO SAVE
YOU SOME TIME.

01:45.417 --> 01:47.834
CAN YOU HAND ME THAT
"B" ROLL OVER THERE?

01:47.834 --> 01:49.208
BY THE WAY, I'M
TAKING SUGGESTIONS

01:49.208 --> 01:51.375
ON WHAT TO GET MY
PARENTS FOR A SUITABLE
ANNIVERSARY GIFT.

01:51.375 --> 01:53.834
I'M AT A TOTAL LOSS.
WHAT DO YOU GET 2 PEOPLE

01:53.834 --> 01:56.542
WHO'VE SPENT EVERY
DAY TOGETHER FOR
THE PAST 20 YEARS?

01:56.542 --> 01:59.458
OFFHAND, I'D SAY
SEPARATE VACATIONS.

01:59.458 --> 02:01.750
UH, DAWSON, I KNOW
YOUR CINEMATIC
INFLUENCES

02:01.750 --> 02:04.041
ARE STILL EVOLVING,

02:04.041 --> 02:05.750
BUT I NEVER
ANTICIPATED
A RUSS MEYER PHASE.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.083
I DIDN'T SHOOT THIS.

02:08.083 --> 02:11.458
I THINK WE FOUND THE
PERFECT ANNIVERSARY
GIFT, DAWSON.

02:11.458 --> 02:12.667
WHAT IS THIS?

02:12.667 --> 02:15.959
I DON'T KNOW.
I SWEAR, I DIDN'T
SHOOT IT. I--

02:15.959 --> 02:17.959
I MUST'VE LEFT
THE CAMERA RUNNING

02:17.959 --> 02:19.667
WHEN WE RAN OUT
OF THE RUINS.

02:19.667 --> 02:23.000
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT WITHOUT
A CERTAIN QUALITY.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.458
VERY WATCHABLE.

02:25.458 --> 02:27.458
YEAH.

02:28.750 --> 02:31.792
IT'S FUNNY. THAT WOMAN
LOOKS FAMILIAR.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.667
I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

02:33.667 --> 02:37.291
IF YOU BRUSHED
HER HAIR OUT OF
HER EYES A LITTLE...

02:37.291 --> 02:40.959
AND MAYBE SAT HER BEHIND
A BIG SCHOOL DESK...

02:40.959 --> 02:43.583
IT COULD
ALMOST BE...

02:43.583 --> 02:45.417
MS. JACOBS.
MS. JACOBS.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.542
SO THERE SHE IS,
ON TAPE,

03:56.542 --> 03:58.291
DOING IT
WITH SOME GUY.

03:58.291 --> 04:01.083
MS. JACOBS, AS IN
SIXTH PERIOD ENGLISH
MS. JACOBS?

04:01.083 --> 04:02.291
THE VERY SAME.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.041
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:04.041 --> 04:05.375
YOU HAVE A TAPE
OF TAMARA?

04:05.375 --> 04:06.375
I'M SORRY, PACEY.
I KNOW YOU THOUGHT

04:06.375 --> 04:09.792
SHE WAS SAVING HERSELF
FOR YOU, BUT...

04:09.792 --> 04:12.250
I WAS SHOOTING
SOME PICKUPS AT
THE RUINS WITH JEN,

04:12.250 --> 04:14.959
AND WE ACCIDENTALLY
LEFT THE CAMERA RUNNING
WHEN WE RAN OUT,

04:14.959 --> 04:16.959
AND THE REST IS
PORNOGRAPHIC HISTORY.

04:16.959 --> 04:20.541
GOD, THAT'S
REALLY STRANGE.

04:20.541 --> 04:24.208
UM, YOU CAN'T TELL
WHO THE GUY IS OR
ANYTHING, CAN YOU?

04:24.208 --> 04:26.041
IT'S A STANDARD
OVER-THE-SHOULDER
SHOT.

04:26.041 --> 04:27.959
WE CAN'T SEE
THE GUY'S FACE.

04:27.959 --> 04:30.333
YEAH. SO IF
YOU'RE THINKING OF
TRACKING HIM DOWN,

04:30.333 --> 04:34.166
JUST LOOK FOR THE GUY
WITH THE BROWN HAIR AND
THROBBING NECK MUSCLES.

04:34.166 --> 04:37.917
HEY, DAWSON, I THINK
I SHOULD GET TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THAT TAPE.

04:37.917 --> 04:40.417
SURE. WE'LL ARRANGE
A PRIVATE SCREENING
FOR YOU.

04:40.417 --> 04:43.041
YEAH, SO YOU CAN
FLOG THE BISHOP
IN PRIVACY.

04:43.041 --> 04:44.250
THAT'S REALLY CLEVER

04:44.250 --> 04:47.542
HOW YOU TURN ALL
THAT SEXUAL REPRESSION
INTO HUMOR.

04:47.542 --> 04:48.834
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M LATE.

04:48.834 --> 04:52.041
I SHOULD GET GOING
BEFORE GRAMS PUTS
OUT AN A.P.B.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.959
I'LL WALK WITH YOU.
LATER, KIDS.

04:53.959 --> 04:55.959
DAWSON, DON'T FORGET, MAN.
I WANNA SEE THAT TAPE.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.708
PERVERT.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.166
PRUDE.

05:00.959 --> 05:04.041
PACEY TALKS A LOT,
LIKE HE'S GOT ALL
THIS EXPERIENCE.

05:04.041 --> 05:05.708
IT'S A LOT
OF BLUSTER.

05:05.708 --> 05:09.083
SOMEONE ONCE SAID
THAT THE MORE A PERSON
TALKS ABOUT IT,

05:09.083 --> 05:10.875
THE WORSE
THEY ARE AT IT.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.583
I HARDLY EVER
TALK ABOUT IT.

05:12.583 --> 05:15.625
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY
I KEEP STICKING AROUND.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.417
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT, DAWSON?

05:19.417 --> 05:23.208
NOW MAY NOT BE
THE BEST TIME FOR THIS.

05:23.208 --> 05:24.291
I TAKE IT
WE'RE NOT ALONE.

05:24.291 --> 05:27.333
PRACTICALLY
A MENAGE รก TROIS.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.500
JUST LOOK AT IT
THIS WAY, DAWSON--

05:29.500 --> 05:32.625
REPRESSING DESIRE
CAN ONLY MAKE IT
MORE POWERFUL.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.875
SO I FIGURE
THE NEXT TIME I SEE YOU,

05:34.875 --> 05:37.125
WE ARE IN FOR
ONE TITANIC KISS.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.834
IF I CAN SURVIVE
THE WAIT.

05:38.834 --> 05:41.750
IT'S NOT WAITING, DAWSON.
IT'S ANTICIPATION.

05:45.166 --> 05:45.583
SCREW IT.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.708
DO YOU DO THESE THINGS
TO UPSET ME, JENNIFER?

06:00.708 --> 06:02.750
IT WAS ONLY
A KISS, GRAMS.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.208
OH, ONLY A KISS.

06:04.208 --> 06:07.667
I SEEM TO REMEMBER
A LOT OF TROUBLE
BACK IN NEW YORK

06:07.667 --> 06:09.583
STARTING
AFTER ONLY A KISS.

06:09.583 --> 06:12.125
YOUR DEFINITION
OF TROUBLE IS BROADER
THAN ANYONE'S I KNOW.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.166
THEN WHY DON'T
YOU TELL ME

06:13.166 --> 06:15.834
WHY YOU THINK
YOUR PARENTS
SENT YOU HERE?

06:15.834 --> 06:17.542
WHY DON'T YOU
REMIND ME AGAIN?

06:17.542 --> 06:20.458
I HAVEN'T HEARD
A RECITATION OF MY SINS
FOR 15 MINUTES NOW.

06:20.458 --> 06:22.959
I DON'T DO THIS
TO TORTURE YOU.

06:22.959 --> 06:26.083
I DO IT SO YOU
WON'T STRAY DOWN
THE SAME PATH TWICE.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.291
YOU KNOW WHAT, GRAMS?
I'M BORED OF THIS--

06:28.291 --> 06:30.417
OF THE WAY WE TALK
TO EACH OTHER,

06:30.417 --> 06:33.458
OF THESE CONVERSATIONS
WE HAVE THAT GO
ROUND AND ROUND

06:33.458 --> 06:34.708
IN THESE INCREDIBLY
PEDESTRIAN CIRCLES,

06:34.708 --> 06:38.041
AND WE SAY THE SAME THINGS
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

06:38.041 --> 06:40.208
SO LET'S JUST END THIS
RIGHT NOW.

06:40.208 --> 06:44.708
WHAT YOU SAW OUTSIDE
WITH ME AND DAWSON, GRAMS,
WAS ONLY A KISS.

06:45.959 --> 06:48.208
"ONLY A KISS."

06:49.291 --> 06:51.875
HOW COULD YOU
HAVE NEVER SEEN
THAT BEFORE?

06:51.875 --> 06:54.708
I HAVE NEVER
SEEN IT BEFORE.
I SWEAR TO GOD.

06:54.708 --> 06:58.083
YOU'RE KIDDING.
AFTER 20 YEARS
OF MARRIAGE--

06:58.083 --> 07:00.083
NOT 20 YET.
NOT UNTIL MONDAY.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.583
HEY, DAWSON,
LISTEN TO THIS.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.417
YOUR MOTHER
JUST TOLD ME
ONLY MOMENTS AGO

07:03.417 --> 07:04.708
THAT SHE HAS
NEVER BEFORE

07:04.708 --> 07:05.708
SEEN THIS SCAR
UNDERNEATH MY CHIN.

07:05.708 --> 07:07.417
THE ONE YOU GOT FROM
THAT MOPED ACCIDENT

07:07.417 --> 07:09.917
10 YEARS AGO
UP AT THE CAPE?

07:09.917 --> 07:11.208
YES. THANK YOU, DAWSON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

07:11.208 --> 07:15.583
YOU SEE THERE?
MY SON KNOWS MY FACE
BETTER THAN YOU DO.

07:15.583 --> 07:18.417
MAYBE YOU SHOULD START
COMING HOME EARLY,

07:18.417 --> 07:21.708
SEE MY FACE
IN THE DAYLIGHT
FOR A CHANGE.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.667
DON'T BOTHER.
I'LL SHOW MYSELF OUT.

07:34.542 --> 07:34.750
PACEY.

07:36.542 --> 07:38.500
PACEY...PACEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:38.500 --> 07:39.458
THE TAPE.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.875
WHAT TAPE?
MS. JACOBS?

07:40.875 --> 07:41.959
YES, THE MS. JACOBS TAPE!

07:41.959 --> 07:45.166
STOP! DUDE,
YOU'RE MESSING UP
MY DAILIES.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.959
I TOLD YOU I'D
SHOW YOU THE TAPE.

07:46.959 --> 07:49.041
YOU COULDN'T WAIT?

07:49.041 --> 07:49.708
NO, I GUESS NOT.

07:52.125 --> 07:55.625
DUDE, I KNEW YOU
HAD IT BAD FOR HER,
BUT CALM DOWN.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.667
IT'S NOT SUCH
A BIG DEAL.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.667
THERE YOU GO...
MAD DOG.

08:06.083 --> 08:07.125
DAWSON.

08:07.125 --> 08:08.208
YEAH?

08:08.208 --> 08:10.875
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I HAVEN'T BEEN

08:10.875 --> 08:14.417
ENTIRELY HONEST
WITH YOU LATELY.

08:14.417 --> 08:16.792
NOT THAT I'VE LIED
TO YOU OR ANYTHING

08:16.792 --> 08:18.875
I'VE JUST WITHHELD
SOME DETAILS.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.750
OK.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.166
WELL...I'M NOT...

08:24.166 --> 08:26.792
CURSED WITH SELF-AWARENESS
LIKE YOU ARE, DAWSON,

08:26.792 --> 08:30.000
BUT I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW
HOW PEOPLE SEE ME.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.207
I MEAN, I'M NOT THE GUY
WHO GETS THE GIRL.

08:33.207 --> 08:34.833
THE GUY WHO TALKS ABOUT
GETTING THE GIRL,

08:34.833 --> 08:36.207
BUT NOT THE GUY
WHO GETS HER.

08:36.207 --> 08:37.667
ENOUGH PEOPLE SAY
THAT STUFF ABOUT YOU,

08:37.667 --> 08:41.375
AND YOU START TO
BELIEVE IT YOURSELF.

08:41.375 --> 08:45.333
I'M NOT QUITE
FOLLOWING YOU
HERE, PACEY.

08:45.333 --> 08:48.458
I GOT THE GIRL
THIS TIME, DAWSON.

08:48.458 --> 08:50.125
WHAT?

08:50.125 --> 08:51.250
YEAH. CALL IT
THE LAW OF AVERAGES,

08:51.250 --> 08:54.041
CALL IT AN ACT OF GOD,
CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT,

08:54.041 --> 08:54.959
BUT I GOT HER.

08:54.959 --> 08:59.166
WHO? WHO?
WHO'D YOU GET,
PACEY?

08:59.166 --> 09:02.667
OH, MAN...UH...

09:02.667 --> 09:07.375
DAWSON, I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT...

09:07.375 --> 09:09.792
THE GUY WITH
THE BROWN HAIR

09:09.792 --> 09:12.291
AND THE THROBBING
NECK MUSCLES...

09:12.291 --> 09:15.834
THE GUY WITH
TAMARA JACOBS,
UH...

09:15.834 --> 09:16.333
THAT'S--THAT'S ME.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.875
NO.
YEAH.

09:18.875 --> 09:20.667
I'M NOT JUST TALKING
THIS TIME, DAWSON,

09:20.667 --> 09:23.542
THOUGH I WISH I WAS
'CAUSE OFF THE TOP
OF MY HEAD,

09:23.542 --> 09:25.333
I CAN THINK OF
ABOUT 40 REASONS

09:25.333 --> 09:26.875
WHY THIS TAPE
COULD RUIN MY LIFE,

09:26.875 --> 09:30.041
NOT THE LEAST
OF WHICH IS THE
EMBARRASSMENT FACTOR.

09:30.041 --> 09:33.542
I MEAN, NO GUY'S
FIRST TIME SHOULD BE
CAPTURED ON VIDEO.

09:33.542 --> 09:38.000
ARE YOU CRAZY?

09:38.000 --> 09:41.667
I DON'T THINK THERE
CURRENTLY EXISTS A WORD
TO DESCRIBE MY REACTION.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.417
BUT I LIKE HER, DAWSON.
I REALLY DO,

09:43.417 --> 09:45.917
AND IT'S NOT
JUST THE SEX, MAN.

09:45.917 --> 09:49.291
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
THIS IS TOO IMPROBABLE
OR BIZARRE

09:49.291 --> 09:51.083
TO EVER WORK OUT.

09:51.083 --> 09:54.834
BIZARRE MIGHT BE
A WORD, YEAH.

09:54.834 --> 09:55.792
YEAH.

09:59.041 --> 10:01.208
UH...THIS...

10:02.708 --> 10:05.208
THIS IS GONNA SOUND
A LITTLE STRANGE,
BUT...

10:05.208 --> 10:07.542
ON THE TAPE, WAS--

10:07.542 --> 10:10.625
I MEAN...DID I
LOOK ALL RIGHT?

10:10.625 --> 10:16.375
PERFORMANCE-WISE,
DID I CUT IT, MAN?

10:17.375 --> 10:20.166
YEAH. YOU
DID FINE, MAN.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.125
FROM WHAT I COULD
TELL, YEAH...

10:24.125 --> 10:27.542
YOU DID FINE.

10:27.542 --> 10:30.250
COOL MAN.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.166
THANKS.

10:32.166 --> 10:35.458
AND, UH...
DON'T TELL
ANYBODY...

10:35.458 --> 10:35.875
ALL RIGHT.

10:56.625 --> 10:57.792
YOU COULD GET THEM
SOME CANDLESTICKS,

10:57.792 --> 11:01.583
A NICE PICTURE FRAME,
MAYBE A PIECE OF FOLK ART.

11:01.583 --> 11:04.125
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THEY'D LIKE SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

11:04.125 --> 11:07.125
DAWSON, YOUR PARENTS
ARE MIDDLE-AGED,
WHITE SUBURBANITES.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.000
THEY LIVE FOR FOLK ART.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.708
YOU SHOULD SEE
MY PARENTS LATELY.
IT'S DISGUSTING.

11:11.708 --> 11:13.708
HALF THE TIME,
THEY'RE MAKING OUT

11:13.708 --> 11:17.000
OR DRY HUMPING
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.041
YOU KNOW, IT'S SAD.
I'M ACTUALLY JEALOUS OF
MY PARENTS' SEX LIFE.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.834
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
BLONDIE ISN'T GIVING
YOU ANY?

11:22.834 --> 11:26.125
I THOUGHT BY NOW
YOU WOULD'VE, UH...

11:26.125 --> 11:28.959
YOU'RE A REAL ROMANTIC,
AREN'T YOU, JOEY?

11:28.959 --> 11:31.417
PERSONALLY, I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL GET ANYWHERE

11:31.417 --> 11:32.959
UNLESS YOU OFF
THE WICKED GRANDMOTHER,
BUT...

11:35.375 --> 11:35.917
MOM?

11:39.208 --> 11:40.750
MOM?

11:40.750 --> 11:43.166
DAWSON!
HELLO.

11:43.166 --> 11:45.166
JOEY. UM...

11:45.166 --> 11:48.125
WHAT ARE YOU DO--
WELL, THIS IS
A SURPRISE.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.667
WHAT BRINGS YOU
OUT HERE?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.667
WE'RE JUST DOING
SOME SHOPPING.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.500
OH. OH, I'M SORRY.
DAWSON, THIS IS--

11:54.500 --> 11:55.583
BOB COLLINSWORTH.

11:55.583 --> 11:57.959
6:00 AND 11:00,
RIGHT? RIGHT.

11:57.959 --> 11:59.041
AND JOEY.

11:59.041 --> 12:00.041
HI.
REAL THRILL.

12:00.041 --> 12:02.333
LISTEN, YOUR MOM
WAS JUST HELPING
ME OUT

12:02.333 --> 12:04.208
WITH A
LITTLE WARDROBE
PROBLEM.

12:04.208 --> 12:06.041
IT SEEMS THE
STATION RESEARCH
HAS INDICATED

12:06.041 --> 12:08.166
THAT WHILE
VIEWERS LIKE ME,

12:08.166 --> 12:11.166
THEY HATE
MY SPORT COATS.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.792
ANYWAY, IT'S
WONDERFUL TO FINALLY
MEET YOU, DAWSON.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.959
YOUR MOTHER'S
TOLD ME ALL ABOUT
YOUR FILM.

12:15.959 --> 12:18.291
BEING A BIT OF
AN INDIE FAN MYSELF,

12:18.291 --> 12:20.500
I'D LOVE TO
TAKE A LOOK AT IT
WHENEVER IT'S DONE.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.291
SURE. OK, YEAH.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.917
BOB, WE REALLY
SHOULD GET BACK TO
THE PREP SESSION.

12:25.917 --> 12:26.708
SHE'S RIGHT.
TAKE CARE.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.625
PLEASURE TO
MEET YOU BOTH.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.417
SEE YOU AT HOME,
HONEY.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.375
BYE, MOM.
GOOD-BYE, JOEY.

12:36.041 --> 12:38.542
IT'S FUNNY.
WHEN I FIRST SAW
BOB ON TELEVISION,

12:38.542 --> 12:39.750
I THOUGHT HE WAS
A REAL TOOL,

12:39.750 --> 12:42.667
BUT I DON'T KNOW.
NOW THAT I'VE MET
HIM IN PERSON,

12:42.667 --> 12:44.083
HE DOESN'T SEEM SO BAD.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:44.083 --> 12:47.792
I THINK YOU
HAD IT RIGHT
THE FIRST TIME.

12:50.875 --> 12:51.792
DARE I ASK?

12:51.792 --> 12:54.000
YOUR WORST FEARS
ARE FOUNDED, GRAMS.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.959
I'M GOING TO SEE DAWSON.

12:55.959 --> 12:59.083
AND, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I'M JUST ASKING
FOR IT RIGHT NOW,

12:59.083 --> 13:01.083
BUT I WOULD RATHER
YOU SAY WHATEVER IT
IS YOU'RE THINKING

13:01.083 --> 13:05.291
THAN CONTINUE TO
LOOK AT ME THE WAY
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

13:05.291 --> 13:06.750
THAT BOY ONLY WANTS
ONE THING FROM YOU.

13:06.750 --> 13:09.708
NO. THAT'S
NOT DAWSON AT ALL.

13:09.708 --> 13:11.959
HE'S COMPLETELY SWEET
AND HONEST AND ROMANTIC--

13:11.959 --> 13:13.291
AND HIM AND
THAT POTTER GIRL--

13:13.291 --> 13:16.625
THE WAY SHE CLIMBS
IN AND OUT OF HIS
BEDROOM WINDOW.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.417
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO HAZARD A GUESS.

13:18.417 --> 13:20.083
DAWSON AND JOEY
ARE JUST FRIENDS.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.542
SURE, MAYBE
THERE'S SOME OF THAT
SEXUAL TENSION THING

13:21.542 --> 13:24.834
THAT HAPPENS WHEN A GUY
AND A GIRL HAVE BEEN
FRIENDS FOR SO LONG,

13:24.834 --> 13:26.834
BUT THAT'S
AS FAR AS IT GOES.

13:26.834 --> 13:29.750
AND AS FAR AS DAWSON
AND ME, GRAMS,

13:29.750 --> 13:31.667
YOU SAW THE
ENTIRE HIGHLIGHT REEL
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.834
SO I'D BE CORRECT
IN ASSUMING

13:33.834 --> 13:36.875
YOU HAVE CERTAIN
FEELINGS FOR HIM?

13:36.875 --> 13:38.625
YEAH, YOU WOULD.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.166
WELL, NOTHING CAN
BE DONE ABOUT THAT.

13:40.166 --> 13:43.208
I ONLY HOPE YOU
CAN AVOID MAKING
THE MISTAKES

13:43.208 --> 13:47.875
THAT YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW GIRLS
YOUR AGE OFTEN MAKE.

13:47.875 --> 13:53.625
YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS
FIND A WAY TO GET THAT
LAST DIG IN, DON'T YOU?

13:53.625 --> 13:54.708
JENNIFER,
YOU EXASPERATE ME.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.083
EVERYTHING I SAY
ISN'T MEANT
AS CRITICISM.

13:56.083 --> 14:00.458
OH, NO. I KNOW.
SOME OF IT'S MEANT
AS JUDGMENT.

14:12.959 --> 14:14.083
HEY, TAMARA.

14:14.083 --> 14:15.000
HI! THIS IS
A SURPRISE.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.875
WELL, YEAH. I SAW
YOU SITTING HERE.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.708
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D COME ON OVER.

14:19.708 --> 14:21.667
I'M GLAD YOU DID.

14:21.667 --> 14:22.959
WELL, WHAT YOU READING?

14:22.959 --> 14:25.375
OH, JUST THE
APPROVED 10th-GRADE
READING CURRICULUM.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.458
I'M TRYING TO CHOOSE
THE NEXT BOOK FOR
OUR CLASS.

14:27.458 --> 14:28.166
ANY SUGGESTIONS?

14:28.166 --> 14:29.083
YEAH. HOW ABOUT SOMETHING

14:29.083 --> 14:31.917
WITH A LITTLE ACTION
IN IT THIS TIME?

14:31.917 --> 14:32.917
ACTION?

14:32.917 --> 14:34.667
YEAH. SEX.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.875
I MEAN, WHAT IS
OUR SCHOOL BOARD
SO AFRAID OF?

14:36.875 --> 14:39.542
WE'RE PRACTICALLY ADULTS NOW.
WE CAN HANDLE THIS STUFF.

14:39.542 --> 14:42.500
A FEW BLUE NOVELS
ARE NOT GONNA KILL US.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.417
PACEY, EVERY PIECE
OF LITERATURE YOU'LL
READ THIS YEAR

14:45.417 --> 14:46.583
WILL HAVE SEX
IN IT.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.708
EVERYTHING YOU READ
LAST YEAR PROBABLY
AS WELL.

14:48.708 --> 14:50.417
YEAH, BUT IT'S
NOT REAL SEX.

14:50.417 --> 14:54.083
I MEAN, IT'S SEX
AS CAUTIONARY TALE,
SEX AS A WARNING.

14:54.083 --> 14:55.417
I'M NOT KIDDING
ABOUT THIS.

14:55.417 --> 14:56.917
EVERY TIME SOMEBODY
IN ONE OF THOSE BOOKS
HAS SEX,

14:56.917 --> 14:59.417
SOMETHING BAD
HAS TO HAPPEN
TO THEM.

14:59.417 --> 15:00.458
ROMEO AND JULIET--
THEY HAVE SEX,

15:00.458 --> 15:02.208
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
THEY KILL THEMSELVES.

15:02.208 --> 15:05.375
THE SCARLET LETTER?
HESTER PRYNNE HAS SEX,

15:05.375 --> 15:08.333
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
SHE'S AN OUTCAST FOR LIFE.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.875
THE GREEK ONE. THE...

15:09.875 --> 15:11.041
OEDIPUS?

15:11.041 --> 15:13.333
YES. THAT ONE.
THAT GUY SLEEPS
WITH SOME CHICK--

15:13.333 --> 15:14.834
WHO, GRANTED,
IS HIS MOTHER.

15:14.834 --> 15:16.834
HE'S SO FREAKED OUT
BY IT, HE POKES OUT
HIS OWN EYES.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.250
OK? THAT'S
NOT REAL LIFE.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.959
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,
BUT IT HAS BEEN
KNOWN TO HAPPEN

15:22.959 --> 15:26.166
THAT EVERY ONCE IN
A WHILE, TWO PEOPLE
SLEEP TOGETHER,

15:26.166 --> 15:29.750
THEY ENJOY IT, AND
AFTERWARD, EVERYTHING
WORKS OUT FINE.

15:29.750 --> 15:33.333
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT IS POSSIBLE?

15:48.458 --> 15:49.583
STEVEN?

15:49.583 --> 15:51.583
RAHHRRR!

15:51.583 --> 15:53.750
AAH!

15:56.291 --> 16:00.291
ALL RIGHT? REACTION.
I WANT COMPLETE HONESTY.

16:00.291 --> 16:01.166
WELL, IF--

16:01.166 --> 16:02.959
BUT BEFORE YOU
SAY ANYTHING,

16:02.959 --> 16:05.125
JUST KNOW THAT
YOUR OPINION MEANS
A LOT TO ME,

16:05.125 --> 16:07.792
AND IF YOU HATE IT,
I CAN'T EVEN ANTICIPATE

16:07.792 --> 16:09.792
THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL
IT MIGHT SEND ME ON.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.417
WELL, MY PATHETIC
SHRIEK ASIDE,

16:11.417 --> 16:12.834
I THINK IT'S
REALLY GOOD.

16:12.834 --> 16:16.625
VERY PROMISING, AND
I'M SURE IT'S GONNA
TURN OUT GREAT.

16:16.625 --> 16:17.917
GREAT?
REALLY GREAT.

16:17.917 --> 16:22.166
UM, I STILL HAVE
A LOT OF PRE-DUBBING
TO DO TOMORROW.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.625
I'M DOING IT AT
MY MOM'S STATION.

16:23.625 --> 16:28.417
THEY LET ME USE
THE EQUIPMENT DOWN THERE
WITHOUT TOO MUCH HASSLE.

16:28.417 --> 16:30.625
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME ALONG?

16:30.625 --> 16:31.834
YEAH. THAT
SOUNDS COOL.

16:31.834 --> 16:34.250
YEAH? REALLY?

16:34.250 --> 16:35.959
WHY ARE YOU
SO SURPRISED

16:35.959 --> 16:39.333
EVERY TIME I JUMP
AT THE CHANCE TO
SPEND TIME WITH YOU?

16:39.333 --> 16:42.500
I DON'T KNOW.
NATURAL SKEPTICISM
PERHAPS?

16:42.500 --> 16:43.792
WELL, GET OVER IT.

16:43.792 --> 16:47.458
NOT EVERYTHING
IN LIFE HAS TO BE
SO COMPLICATED.

16:53.250 --> 16:54.333
YOU KNOW,
IN THE OLD MOVIES,

16:54.333 --> 16:57.333
WHENEVER 2 CHARACTERS
WERE IN BED TOGETHER,

16:57.333 --> 17:00.041
THE CENSORS ALWAYS MADE
ONE OF THEM KEEP ONE FOOT
ON THE FLOOR.

17:00.041 --> 17:01.542
WHICH I NEVER
REALLY UNDERSTOOD

17:01.542 --> 17:04.165
BECAUSE I FIGURED
IF THE CHARACTERS
WERE CLEVER ENOUGH,

17:04.165 --> 17:06.250
THEY COULD STILL DO
ALMOST ANYTHING.

17:24.916 --> 17:27.000
DAWSON...DAWSON...

17:27.000 --> 17:30.041
WE'VE GOT PLENTY
OF TIME TO PROVE
OUR CENSORS WRONG.

17:30.041 --> 17:33.250
WE DON'T HAVE TO
MAKE OUR CASE TODAY.
ALL RIGHT?

17:34.542 --> 17:35.959
OK.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.041
AAH!

17:40.041 --> 17:41.375
ALL RIGHT.
THAT WAS GREAT.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.875
COULD WE SEE THAT
WITH PICTURE?

17:42.875 --> 17:44.208
SURE. YEAH.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.083
SEEN YOUR MOM
THIS MORNING YET,
DAWSON?

17:46.083 --> 17:51.125
NO. I'LL TRACK
HER DOWN LATER.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.792
OK, HERE WE GO.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.708
Recording: AAH!

17:55.708 --> 17:59.041
WE'LL GO AGAIN.
THIS TIME, MORE SHOCK,
LESS ANGER.

17:59.041 --> 18:01.291
ALL RIGHT. MORE SHOCK,
LESS ANGER. OK.

18:06.041 --> 18:10.583
AA--I'M SORRY,
DAWSON. I...

18:10.583 --> 18:11.417
OK. WE'LL TAKE
A BREAK.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.250
I'M SORRY IF
I WAS BEING

18:17.250 --> 18:19.542
A BIT OF
A PERFECTIONIST
IN THERE.

18:19.542 --> 18:21.083
I GET LIKE THAT
SOMETIMES.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.917
NO. I LIKE
A MAN WHO KNOWS
WHAT HE WANTS.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.625
REALLY?
SORTA LIKE ME?

18:25.625 --> 18:27.792
SORTA.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.959
OH, DAWSON, LOOK.
THERE'S YOUR MOM.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.583
COME ON.

18:58.625 --> 19:03.291
LOOK, I KNOW YOUR HEAD
MUST BE SPINNING
RIGHT NOW, AND...

19:03.291 --> 19:06.291
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
ONE OF THE THINGS
YOU'RE THINKING

19:06.291 --> 19:08.750
IS HOW UNFAIR IT IS
THAT RIGHT NOW,

19:08.750 --> 19:11.250
WHEN YOU NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE MOST,

19:11.250 --> 19:15.041
YOU'RE KIND OF STUCK HERE
WITH LITTLE MORE THAN
A SEMI-STRANGER.

19:15.041 --> 19:19.041
BUT WE ALWAYS SEEM
TO HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY TO EACH OTHER,

19:19.041 --> 19:22.417
EVEN IF OUR CONVERSATIONS
ARE MORE BANTER
THAN REAL TALK.

19:22.417 --> 19:27.375
YOU KNOW, FUN AND SWEET
AND EVERYTHING, BUT
KIND OF ON THE SURFACE.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.667
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS...

19:28.667 --> 19:33.041
IS THAT IF YOU WANT
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY
ABOUT THIS,

19:33.041 --> 19:37.166
I MEAN REALLY TALK--
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW WE'VE
NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE--

19:37.166 --> 19:40.458
WELL, I'D REALLY LIKE
TO BE THAT PERSON.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.542
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

19:54.375 --> 19:56.333
WHAT I SHOULD
REALLY DO IS
TELL MY DAD.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.333
"DAD, THE WOMAN
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO CELEBRATE

19:58.333 --> 19:59.333
"20 BLISSFUL YEARS
OF MARRIAGE WITH,

19:59.333 --> 20:01.917
"WELL,
SHE'S SLEEPING
WITH BOB NOW.

20:01.917 --> 20:04.625
"APPARENTLY,
THE SCENT OF HIS
ICE-BLUE AQUA VELVA

20:04.625 --> 20:06.333
WAS TOO MUCH
TO RESIST."

20:06.333 --> 20:10.208
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT THE BEST
IDEA, DAWSON.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.250
I JOKED ABOUT THEM
HAVING AN AFFAIR,

20:12.250 --> 20:13.834
BUT I WAS NEVER
SERIOUS.

20:13.834 --> 20:15.083
YOU EVER WONDERED

20:15.083 --> 20:17.125
WHAT THE RATE
OF ADULTERY IS
IN THIS TOWN?

20:17.125 --> 20:18.417
YOUR PARENTS,
MY PARENTS.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.500
WE LIVE IN THIS
NORMAN ROCKWELL,
PICTURE POSTCARD TOWN

20:21.500 --> 20:24.417
WITH WHITEWASHED FENCES
AND BEACHFRONT HOUSES,
AND UNDERNEATH, IT'S...

20:27.166 --> 20:28.792
DO YOU THINK
PEOPLE KNOW?

20:28.792 --> 20:31.041
PEOPLE ALWAYS KNOW.

20:31.041 --> 20:32.417
WELL, WE DIDN'T.

20:35.542 --> 20:37.917
RIGHT?

20:37.917 --> 20:39.166
JOEY?

20:39.166 --> 20:41.708
JOEY, I DIDN'T KNOW.

20:43.417 --> 20:44.583
DID YOU?

20:45.708 --> 20:47.375
YOU KNEW.

20:47.375 --> 20:51.500
YOU--HOW COULD YOU
NOT SAY ANYTHING?

20:51.500 --> 20:54.208
WHY? SO YOU
COULD HATE ME
FOR TELLING YOU?

20:54.208 --> 20:57.125
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
THAT'S WHAT
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

20:57.125 --> 21:00.375
BESIDES, I THOUGHT YOU
WOULD'VE SEEN IT BY NOW.

21:00.375 --> 21:01.375
WHAT?

21:01.375 --> 21:03.542
YOU'RE A PRETTY
PERCEPTIVE GUY, USUALLY,

21:03.542 --> 21:07.291
BUT I THINK WE CAN AGREE
THAT YOU'VE BEEN A LITTLE
PREOCCUPIED LATELY.

21:07.291 --> 21:08.500
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

21:08.500 --> 21:10.917
BLONDE HAIR, ABOUT
THE LAST STAGES
OF A "B" CUP.

21:10.917 --> 21:13.291
DON'T TURN THIS
INTO A DISCUSSION
ABOUT JEN.

21:13.291 --> 21:14.750
JOEY, YOU LIED
TO ME.

21:14.750 --> 21:15.875
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO...

21:15.875 --> 21:18.291
WHAT, ARE YOU
THREATENED BY JEN?

21:18.291 --> 21:20.166
NO, I'M NOT THREATENED.
I'M BORED.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.125
SO YOU LIE TO ME TO
CURB YOUR OWN BOREDOM.

21:22.125 --> 21:25.417
I WAS TRYING
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

21:25.417 --> 21:26.750
NO. WHAT YOU DID
WAS NOT THE ACTION
OF A FRIEND.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.583
WHAT YOU DID--
AND LET ME MAKE THIS
PERFECTLY CLEAR--

21:29.583 --> 21:30.458
IS DISENGAGE
THIS FRIENDSHIP.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.250
NO, DAWSON.
I WAS TRYING, AND--

21:32.250 --> 21:34.917
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO...

21:34.917 --> 21:37.125
STRUGGLING FOR

FIRST OF ALL,
I KNOW YOU

IS THAT
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH SOME STUPID "IN"

31:53.417 --> 31:55.875
OR EVEN GETTING JEN
IN THE SACK. IT HAS
TO DO WITH ONE THING.

31:55.875 --> 31:59.500
RIGHT. THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE SCARED.

32:01.458 --> 32:03.875
LISTEN, DAWSON,

32:03.875 --> 32:05.333
THE JEN LINDLEY

32:05.333 --> 32:07.417
THAT YOU HAVE BUILT
UP IN YOUR MIND

32:07.417 --> 32:10.792
DOES NOT ENTIRELY
EXIST, OK?

32:10.792 --> 32:12.250
IN YOUR MOVIES,
SHE CAN BE
WHATEVER YOU WANT,

32:12.250 --> 32:14.458
BUT IN REAL LIFE,
THE SCRIPT'S
GOT THROWN OUT.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.875
SO IT SEEMS.

32:16.875 --> 32:17.917
LISTEN...

32:17.917 --> 32:20.458
ALL I CAN SAY
IS ENJOY IT, MAN.

32:20.458 --> 32:22.458
LIFE HAS SOME PRETTY
UNEXPECTED BENEFITS.

32:22.458 --> 32:23.917
YEAH.

32:23.917 --> 32:27.625
I COULD DO WITHOUT
ALL THE UNEXPECTED
PLOT TWISTS, THOUGH.

32:27.625 --> 32:28.875
THE VIRGINAL GIRLFRIEND...

32:28.875 --> 32:30.250
WHO'S NOT
EXACTLY A VIRGIN.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.125
AND THE HIGH SCHOOL
STRIKE OUT ARTIST...

32:32.125 --> 32:35.750
WHO'S NOW HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH HIS
ENGLISH TEACHER.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.750
THEN THERE'S ALSO
THE HAPPILY MARRIED COUPLE

32:37.750 --> 32:39.750
WHO'S CELEBRATING
THEIR 20th WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY TONIGHT

32:39.750 --> 32:41.458
WHO'S REALLY NOT
AS HAPPY AS WE THOUGHT.

32:41.458 --> 32:43.208
YEAH.

32:43.208 --> 32:45.041
THAT SUCKS, MAN.

32:45.041 --> 32:46.583
[SIGHS]

32:46.583 --> 32:47.959
SO, DID YOU TALK
TO YOUR MOM?

32:47.959 --> 32:50.041
NOPE. CHANGE OF PLAN.

32:50.041 --> 32:52.208
DAWSON, I THOUGHT
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA TELL HER.

32:56.750 --> 32:58.500
I'M GONNA TELL MY DAD.

33:03.291 --> 33:06.291
[MUSIC PLAYING]

33:11.458 --> 33:13.458
HEY.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.333
[LOUDER] HEY.

33:14.333 --> 33:15.583
HEY. I DIDN'T
HEAR YOU COME IN.

33:15.583 --> 33:16.125
[MUSIC DOWN]

33:16.125 --> 33:17.708
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

33:17.708 --> 33:19.333
SO TONIGHT'S
THE BIG NIGHT, HUH?

33:19.333 --> 33:21.834
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW LONG 20 YEARS IS?

33:21.834 --> 33:24.333
AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN
INCLUDE THE 4 YEARS
YOUR MOTHER AND I DATED.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.875
THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT--

33:25.875 --> 33:27.000
MOST OF
OUR COLLEGE FRIENDS

33:27.000 --> 33:29.917
ARE ALREADY ON
THEIR SECOND MARRIAGES
BY NOW.

33:29.917 --> 33:32.000
WE ALL GOT MARRIED
AT THE SAME TIME,
EARLY 20s,

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
WHICH IS A LITTLE YOUNG
BY TODAY'S--

33:33.000 --> 33:35.166
I ADMIT THERE'S
A STRONG POSSIBILITY

33:35.166 --> 33:36.834
THIS IS NOT
THE RIGHT TIME
FOR THIS--

33:36.834 --> 33:38.166
BUT YOU KNOW,
AFTER 20 YEARS,

33:38.166 --> 33:40.959
I CAN STILL SAY
THE SAME THING
I DID THEN.

33:40.959 --> 33:42.834
I CAN'T IMAGINE
MY LIFE WITHOUT HER.

33:42.834 --> 33:43.792
DAD...

33:43.792 --> 33:44.917
WHAT?

33:44.917 --> 33:46.417
THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOT TO TELL YOU.

33:46.417 --> 33:47.875
SOUND SERIOUS.
WHAT IS IT?

33:47.875 --> 33:50.291
IT IS, AND I KNOW
THIS IS THE WRONG TIME
TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT--

33:50.291 --> 33:52.208
HI, DAWSON.

33:52.208 --> 33:52.667
I'LL BE READY
IN A SECOND, HONEY.

33:52.667 --> 33:55.625
OK, FINE.

34:02.542 --> 34:05.041
UH...DAWSON,
I'M LISTENING.

34:06.458 --> 34:08.125
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY,
DAD.

34:08.875 --> 34:11.291
HAVE A GREAT TIME.

34:11.291 --> 34:11.750
OH...

34:11.750 --> 34:13.375
THAT I WILL.

34:22.208 --> 34:24.000
HI.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.041
SORRY,
THE KITCHEN'S CLOSED.

34:26.041 --> 34:27.500
WELL, IF YOU CAN
SURVIVE THE SHOCK,

34:27.500 --> 34:29.875
I ACTUALLY CAME
TO SEE YOU.

34:29.875 --> 34:32.083
I NEED SOME ADVICE.

34:32.083 --> 34:34.958
ON WHAT FIELD
DO YOU CONSIDER ME
AN EXPERT IN?

34:34.958 --> 34:36.708
DAWSON LEERY.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.875
YOU KNOW, I'M
SORT OF BUSY HERE

34:39.875 --> 34:41.375
WITH THESE RECEIPTS
AND LOCKING UP.

34:41.375 --> 34:43.000
MAYBE WE COULD DO THIS
ANOTHER TIME?

34:43.000 --> 34:46.083
I TOLD HIM
I WASN'T A VIRGIN.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.166
I THINK I HAVE A MINUTE.

34:48.166 --> 34:49.375
IT'S JUST THAT HE SEEMED
SO DISAPPOINTED IN ME

34:49.375 --> 34:52.583
WHICH OF COURSE
MADE ME ANGRY
AND, UH...

34:52.583 --> 34:55.833
NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE ARE.

34:55.833 --> 34:57.667
WELL...

34:57.667 --> 34:58.667
LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT DAWSON.

34:58.667 --> 35:01.750
GRANTED
HE'S ARTICULATE
FOR HIS AGE,

35:01.750 --> 35:03.458
BUT HE'S NOT
EXACTLY MATURE.

35:03.458 --> 35:05.083
I MEAN,
HE'S THE CLASSIC
ONLY CHILD.

35:05.083 --> 35:06.917
HE POUTS WHEN THINGS
DON'T GO HIS WAY,

35:06.917 --> 35:09.250
AND
HE ONLY SEES THINGS
IN BLACK AND WHITE.

35:09.250 --> 35:10.792
ANYTHING ELSE
CONFUSES HIM.

35:10.792 --> 35:11.583
YEAH.

35:11.583 --> 35:12.708
AND WHEN
IT COMES TO WOMEN,

35:12.708 --> 35:14.417
THERE ARE POPES
WHO'VE HAD MORE
EXPERIENCE.

35:14.417 --> 35:17.083
I MEAN,
THE GUY WAS A SHRIMP
UNTIL LAST SUMMER.

35:17.083 --> 35:19.750
TO SAY HIS SEX LIFE
IS LIMITED

35:19.750 --> 35:21.250
IS THE UNDERSTATEMENT
OF THE DECADE.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.875
IT'S BARREN.

35:22.875 --> 35:24.583
A DESERT.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.041
I DON'T ENVY YOU

35:26.041 --> 35:28.208
WHAT YOU HAVE
TO DEAL WITH,
BELIEVE ME.

35:28.208 --> 35:30.458
YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO SCARE ME OFF,
ARE YOU?

35:30.458 --> 35:32.208
NO.

35:32.208 --> 35:34.333
I'M JUST
TRYING TO TELL YOU
THAT EVERY GUY

35:34.333 --> 35:36.667
WHO GROWS UP TO BE
ONE OF THE GOOD ONES

35:36.667 --> 35:40.166
WAS PROBABLY
A DWEEB WITH GIRLS
WHEN HE WAS 15, TOO.

35:40.166 --> 35:42.750
SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

35:42.750 --> 35:45.458
HMM...SAME AS YOU.

35:45.458 --> 35:46.834
I'D GET HURT.

35:46.834 --> 35:47.792
MAD.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.000
CONFUSED.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.041
ASK PEOPLE
FOR ADVICE.

35:52.041 --> 35:52.750
MAYBE
THE WRONG PEOPLE,

35:52.750 --> 35:55.166
AND THEN I'D WAIT.

35:55.166 --> 35:56.208
FOR WHAT?

35:56.208 --> 35:59.583
FOR HIM TO GROW UP,
COME AROUND...

35:59.583 --> 36:01.458
EVERYTHING.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.208
AND HOW LONG
DOES THAT TAKE?

36:03.208 --> 36:05.417
OH, DON'T GO BY ME.

36:05.417 --> 36:09.417
I'D PROBABLY
BE STUPID ENOUGH
TO WAIT FOREVER.

36:11.708 --> 36:14.583
MIND A LITTLE COMPANY?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.291
PACEY: CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

36:20.291 --> 36:23.458
HOW OLD ARE YOU,
TAMARA, LIKE, 35?

36:23.458 --> 36:25.000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.792
MM. YOU'VE BEEN
WITH OTHER GUYS, RIGHT?

36:26.792 --> 36:30.708
SOME, YES.

36:30.708 --> 36:32.500
A LOT?

36:32.500 --> 36:34.375
WELL, NOT A LOT
THAT MATTERED.

36:36.166 --> 36:38.083
AND HOW MANY WAS THAT?

36:38.083 --> 36:42.667
THAT MATTERED?
YOU WANT NUMBERS?

36:42.667 --> 36:44.667
WELL, LET'S SEE.

36:46.375 --> 36:47.959
THERE WAS ONE
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

36:47.959 --> 36:51.667
AND...
ONE IN COLLEGE...

36:51.667 --> 36:55.583
AND SINCE THEN,
I'D SAY, UH...

36:55.583 --> 36:58.291
THERE'VE BEEN 3.

36:58.291 --> 37:00.458
BUT NO ONE
FOR A FEW YEARS.

37:03.583 --> 37:06.125
OH.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.041
GREAT. UM, THANKS.

37:12.041 --> 37:13.708
PACEY.

37:13.708 --> 37:14.542
YEAH?

37:14.542 --> 37:17.417
ABOUT THE ONE
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

37:17.417 --> 37:18.417
HMM?

37:18.417 --> 37:21.166
I DIDN'T MEAN
MY  HIGH SCHOOL.

37:25.834 --> 37:28.041
[JEN SIGHS]

37:28.041 --> 37:30.750
WELL, IT'S BEEN
ANOTHER BUSY WEEK
HERE IN CAPESIDE.

37:30.750 --> 37:31.875
LAST 2 PEOPLE

37:31.875 --> 37:32.875
I EVER THOUGHT
WOULD AGREE ON ANYTHING

37:32.875 --> 37:34.917
NOW DO.

37:34.917 --> 37:36.792
BOTH GRAMS AND DAWSON
OFFICIALLY THINK

37:36.792 --> 37:40.125
I'M A SLUT.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.625
YOU KNOW,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

37:42.625 --> 37:44.750
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

37:44.750 --> 37:45.750
I MEAN, IN 2 YEARS,

37:45.750 --> 37:48.834
NEARLY 55% OF MY PEERS
WILL HAVE HAD SEX,

37:48.834 --> 37:50.417
AND IN 5 YEARS,
IT'LL BE ALMOST 100,

37:50.417 --> 37:54.583
AND NOBODY WILL CARE
WHEN I DID IT.

37:54.583 --> 37:56.083
BUT AS FOR NOW,

37:56.083 --> 37:59.917
IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE
AND MAJOR DEAL.

37:59.917 --> 38:01.250
WHO KNOWS?

38:01.250 --> 38:02.750
MAYBE BY THE TIME
YOU WAKE UP,

38:02.750 --> 38:04.250
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL
WITH A SHADY PAST

38:04.250 --> 38:06.834
WON'T BE SUCH
A BAD THING.

38:36.375 --> 38:40.125
HANGING OUT WITH
ALL YOUR FRIENDS?

38:40.125 --> 38:43.959
YEAH. THAT'S WHY
YOU WEREN'T INVITED.

38:43.959 --> 38:46.583
PHASERS ON STUN.
I COME IN PEACE.

38:49.625 --> 38:50.750
YOU'RE GONNA SCREW IT UP,
YOU KNOW.

38:50.750 --> 38:52.625
WHAT?

38:52.625 --> 38:54.417
JEN. SHE CAME
AND TALKED TO ME.

38:54.417 --> 38:57.750
I TOLD HER, SIT TIGHT.
HE'LL BE BACK.

38:57.750 --> 39:00.333
YEAH, THANKS.
I APPRECIATE IT, JOEY.

39:00.333 --> 39:03.625
I EXPLAINED THAT IT'S
JUST DISPLACED ANGER,

39:03.625 --> 39:05.000
AND YOU'RE MAD
AT YOUR MOM AND DAD.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.875
I'M MAD AT THE WORLD,
JOEY.

39:06.875 --> 39:08.333
I'M A TEENAGER.

39:08.333 --> 39:09.792
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
WE'RE OLD PALS NOW,
BLONDIE AND I,

39:09.792 --> 39:13.792
SO, UH, YOU HAVE ANY MESSAGES
YOU WANT TO GET BACK TO HER,

39:13.792 --> 39:14.792
JUST LET ME KNOW--

39:14.792 --> 39:16.166
LOOK, JOEY, WHATEVER
YOU'VE DONE, THANKS,

39:16.166 --> 39:18.625
BUT I JUST DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
RIGHT NOW.

39:18.625 --> 39:20.375
WITH YOU.

39:20.375 --> 39:21.333
COME ON.

39:21.333 --> 39:22.834
PASSING UP A CHANCE

39:22.834 --> 39:26.000
TO DISH ABOUT
THE GIRL OF YOUR DREAMS?

39:26.000 --> 39:27.500
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
YOU DID WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

39:27.500 --> 39:30.500
IT IS, EXCEPT I'M
NOT SURE THAT WE ARE.

39:33.750 --> 39:34.959
OH.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.667
HOW DROLL.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.542
THE TABLES
HAVE BEEN TURNED.

39:39.542 --> 39:41.417
THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT YESTERDAY, JOEY.

39:41.417 --> 39:42.500
IT'S LAST WEEK,
LAST MONTH.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.959
IT...EVERYTHING
BETWEEN US RECENTLY.

39:45.959 --> 39:47.500
WE JUST...

39:47.500 --> 39:50.125
WE'RE NOT GETTING ALONG
THE SAME WAY WE USED TO.

39:50.125 --> 39:51.083
SO THE FRIENDSHIP,

39:51.083 --> 39:53.917
YOU DON'T THINK
WE'RE FRIENDS ANYMORE?

39:53.917 --> 39:56.583
OH, I DON'T...

39:56.583 --> 39:58.917
I DON'T KNOW. ARE WE
MORE? ARE WE LESS?

39:58.917 --> 40:04.041
I...ALL I KNOW IS,
IT'S JUST NOT THE WAY
IT USED TO BE.

40:04.041 --> 40:05.500
NOTHING IS ANYMORE.

40:05.500 --> 40:09.208
IT'S CALLED SOCIAL EVOLUTION,
DAWSON.

40:09.208 --> 40:10.875
WHAT'S STRONG ENOUGH
FLOURISHES,

40:10.875 --> 40:15.041
AND WHAT DOESN'T WE
LOOK AT BEHIND GLASS CASES
IN SCIENCE MUSEUMS.

40:16.542 --> 40:18.125
YOU AND I?

40:19.542 --> 40:22.458
ARE WE MUSEUM-BOUND?

40:23.959 --> 40:25.834
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.083
YOU GET ANGRY AT ME
TOO EASILY.

40:33.083 --> 40:35.125
YOU'RE WAY
TOO CRITICAL OF ME.

40:38.625 --> 40:40.792
YOU KNOW, IN SOME
ALTERNATE UNIVERSE,

40:40.792 --> 40:42.542
WE MUST HAVE BEEN
MARRIED, LIKE, 50 YEARS.

40:42.542 --> 40:44.041
YEAH, AND I'M SURE IT WAS
A WONDERFUL WEDDING.

40:44.041 --> 40:45.917
OH, THE BEST.

40:45.917 --> 40:46.875
WE EACH BROUGHT DATES,
I ASSUME.

40:46.875 --> 40:49.875
YEAH, JEN WAS
BY MY SIDE THROUGHOUT.

40:49.875 --> 40:53.750
AND AT THE END OF THE EVENING,
THE INEVITABLE QUESTION.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.375
WHO DO YOU TAKE HOME?

40:55.375 --> 40:57.166
THE DATE OR THE WIFE?

40:57.166 --> 40:58.792
MMM. A DILEMMA.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.125
BUT FASCINATING.

41:00.125 --> 41:04.000
FACED WITH THE CHOICE,
YOU STOOD, SURVEYING
YOUR OPTIONS.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.500
YOUR EYES DRIFTED SLOWLY...
FROM HER...TO ME...

41:10.250 --> 41:11.792
THEN BACK TO HER...

41:14.500 --> 41:16.458
THEN BACK TO YOU?

41:16.458 --> 41:20.125
YEAH, BUT I WAS OFF
HAVING A DRINK WITH
THE RICH GUY AT THE BAR.

41:20.125 --> 41:21.125
UNTIL MONEYBAGS
GOT FRESH,

41:21.125 --> 41:23.875
AND YOU NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO BAIL YOU OUT.

41:23.875 --> 41:24.875
REALLY?

41:24.875 --> 41:25.834
MM-HMM.

41:25.834 --> 41:27.291
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT PART.

41:27.291 --> 41:28.917
OH, I DO, CLEAR AS DAY,
ABSOLUTELY.

41:28.917 --> 41:33.125
YOU...WERE DEFINITELY
IN NEED OF A RESCUE.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.708
AND WERE YOU MAN ENOUGH?

41:34.708 --> 41:40.166
DID YOU SET ASIDE
YOUR CLEARHEADED ANALYSIS
OF THE SITUATION AND ACT?

41:44.667 --> 41:47.625
DID WE, UH, DID WE SAVE
EACH OTHER THAT NIGHT,
DAWSON?

41:54.583 --> 41:58.792
I--YOU KNOW, IT GETS
SO HAZY AT THIS POINT,

41:58.792 --> 42:01.000
I--I REALLY
CAN'T REMEMBER.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.583
COULDN'T TELL YA.

42:02.583 --> 42:05.917
WELL, WHEN IT COMES
BACK TO YOU,

42:05.917 --> 42:10.500
I'D CERTAINLY BE CURIOUS
TO HEAR HOW IT ALL ENDED.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.375
YOU'LL BE MY FIRST CALL.

42:21.208 --> 42:23.500
WELL...GOOD NIGHT, DAWSON.

42:23.500 --> 42:26.875
ALL THIS SUBTEXT
IS MAKING ME TIRED.

42:32.875 --> 42:34.291
DAWSON?

42:34.291 --> 42:36.792
YEAH?

42:39.542 --> 42:42.000
NO MATTER HOW
THE WEDDING TURNED OUT...

42:44.375 --> 42:48.041
I'M PRETTY SURE
I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME
UP UNTIL THE END.

42:48.041 --> 42:50.125
YEAH.

42:54.166 --> 42:55.750
ME, TOO.

43:11.250 --> 43:12.708
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

43:14.667 --> 43:17.291
STRAIGHT
TO THE SMITHSONIAN.
