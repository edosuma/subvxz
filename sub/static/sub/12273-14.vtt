WEBVTT

00:07.175 --> 00:09.177
(horn honking,
train rattling on tracks)

00:17.085 --> 00:19.087
(spray paint hissing
onto wall)

00:21.155 --> 00:23.724
MAN:
I'm surprised
the paint isn't frozen.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.094
Thought you wanted
to do this.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.129
I did.
Defacing personal property

00:28.162 --> 00:30.731
at 5:00 in the morning
sounded great last night.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.800
It's not about
defacing property.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.335
It's about disseminating
a message.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.769
But maybe you've got

00:35.803 --> 00:39.373
more important things to do,
like play Call To Duty.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.374
Hey, I'm here, aren't I?

00:40.408 --> 00:41.575
I think you got
your point across.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.177
Can we just go get coffee now?

00:43.211 --> 00:45.446
I'm not finished.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.580
(sighs)

00:46.614 --> 00:47.748
It's Call Of Duty.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.783
(engines revving)

00:50.784 --> 00:52.320
Abby, come on.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.322
You don't need coffee.
(tires squealing)

00:54.355 --> 00:56.324
(thudding, glass breaking)

00:56.357 --> 00:59.527
It's a car accident.
Somebody could be hurt.
Abby...

00:59.560 --> 01:00.794
(sighs)

01:05.299 --> 01:06.734
It's just a fender bender.
Everybody's fine.

01:06.767 --> 01:07.835
Well, what if
they're not?

01:07.868 --> 01:09.002
The fewer people that know
we're here, the better.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.477
Maybe we should take this as
a sign and just get out of here?

01:16.510 --> 01:17.711
Look, just one more.

01:17.745 --> 01:18.846
Don't you think
that's a little overkill?

01:18.879 --> 01:21.182
(two gunshots)

01:23.484 --> 01:25.186
Abby, wait!

01:29.890 --> 01:32.092
(tires squealing)

01:35.663 --> 01:38.466
Oh, God.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.601
(tires squealing)

01:40.634 --> 01:43.604
LOVATO:
So you were just strolling
the streets at 5:00 a.m.,

01:43.637 --> 01:45.173
taking in the beautiful sites?

01:45.206 --> 01:47.475
We were taking pictures
for a photography class.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.410
You must have gotten
some real close-ups.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.612
Your girlfriend has red paint
on her hands.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.347
Look, right now,

01:53.381 --> 01:54.682
I don't care
about murdered cows.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.150
I care about a murdered human.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.451
So I need to make sure

01:57.485 --> 01:58.752
that you're telling me
absolutely everything.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.588
Yeah, I swear.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.922
All right.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.658
She's cute.
Just use your head.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.162
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:08.196 --> 02:11.299
It's so amazing what a guy
would do to impress a girl.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.801
Well, some of you are harder
to impress than others.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.503
You don't have
to impress us.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.705
You just have to
be honest with us.

02:17.738 --> 02:18.906
(laughing):
Oh, be honest?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.474
That's it?
Simple as that.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.510
(indistinct chatter,
siren chirps)

02:24.645 --> 02:26.180
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:26.214 --> 02:27.348
(camera shutter clicks)

02:27.381 --> 02:29.683
(exhales through mouth)
Oh, it's mornings

02:29.717 --> 02:32.953
like these that make me
wish I was back in Alabama.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.888
Oh, it's whining about
a little chill in the air

02:34.922 --> 02:36.657
that makes me wish
you were in Alabama, too.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.791
(laughs)

02:37.825 --> 02:40.194
Got a white male,

02:40.228 --> 02:42.563
20s, no ID,
no wallet, nothing.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.564
Looks like

02:43.597 --> 02:44.832
two bullets in the chest.

02:44.865 --> 02:45.666
Any witnesses?

02:45.699 --> 02:48.536
Couple of animal
rights activists...

02:48.569 --> 02:50.204
who have a beef with beef.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.605
FLACK:
They were busy
leaving their mark

02:51.639 --> 02:54.408
when they saw two cars, heard
the crash, heard the shots.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.776
LOVATO:
They didn't see anyone,

02:55.809 --> 02:57.511
other than the vic
when the vehicles left.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.280
The whole thing
took about a minute.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.548
And their stories match up.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.916
We're looking
for a late-model BMW four-door

03:02.950 --> 03:06.554
rear-ended by an unmarked beige
van with rust and some dents.

03:06.587 --> 03:07.521
At least ten years old.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.789
Two vehicles, two drivers.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.392
Looks like

03:11.425 --> 03:13.427
we're looking for
at least two people.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.429
Whole thing was very fast
and efficient. Could be a hit.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.566
(tires squealing)

03:18.599 --> 03:20.234
TAYLOR:
Junker rear-ends a luxury car--

03:20.268 --> 03:22.303
sounds more like
a carjacking to me.

03:22.336 --> 03:25.205
(grunting, two gunshots)

03:27.741 --> 03:29.743
(tires squealing)

03:31.612 --> 03:34.448
That's one way to trade up.

03:57.338 --> 04:01.609
* Out here in the fields

04:01.642 --> 04:05.613
* I fight for my meals

04:05.646 --> 04:10.284
* I get my back into my living

04:12.653 --> 04:14.688
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.334
(camera shutter clicking)

04:26.367 --> 04:28.336
(thudding, glass breaking)

04:28.369 --> 04:31.872
(camera shutter clicking)

04:31.905 --> 04:33.474
(tires squealing)

04:33.507 --> 04:35.376
(camera shutter clicking)

04:36.510 --> 04:38.379
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

04:39.046 --> 04:40.681
(camera shutter clicks)

04:40.714 --> 04:42.550
(gunshot, grunting)

04:42.583 --> 04:44.785
(camera shutter clicks)

04:45.786 --> 04:49.557
(hissing)

04:51.124 --> 04:53.293
(whirring)

04:58.432 --> 04:59.700
(beep)

05:05.639 --> 05:07.074
(beeping)

05:37.938 --> 05:39.940
*

06:04.197 --> 06:06.166
SID:
No hit on the fingerprints

06:06.199 --> 06:10.504
in AFIS, which leaves us
with a Caucasian male,

06:10.538 --> 06:14.041
five foot, ten, 174
pounds, between 23 and

06:14.074 --> 06:15.643
27 years of age.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.177
I'm guessing COD is no surprise.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.912
Uh, one bullet shattered

06:18.946 --> 06:20.881
his sternum.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.183
The other severed his
left main coronary artery

06:23.216 --> 06:25.018
before lodging in his spine.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.787
Blood loss
was rapid and fatal.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.921
Stellate tearing.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.790
These are close contact wounds.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.091
A couple more things.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.961
I found a trace of white powder
in his nostrils.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.096
Just got the results
back from the lab.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.898
Cocaine?
Flour.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.767
Bleached and all-purpose.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.170
Oh. Our vic liked to bake.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.539
Well, I'm hoping that, uh,

06:45.573 --> 06:47.575
the other thing
is a bit more helpful?

06:47.608 --> 06:50.077
I have saved
the best for last.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.580
Three scars. I'd say

06:52.613 --> 06:53.981
about a year old?

06:54.014 --> 06:55.516
More bullet wounds?

06:55.549 --> 06:57.084
That's what I thought

06:57.117 --> 07:00.854
until I opened him up and found
he's missing his gallbladder.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.591
Laparoscopic surgery.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.594
That's pretty rare
for a guy this young.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.162
Very rare. Probably no more
than a couple of dozen patients

07:09.196 --> 07:11.164
in the last year
in local hospitals.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.602
Well, who needs fingerprints?

07:29.249 --> 07:31.451
(whirring)

07:34.087 --> 07:35.789
(computer trilling)

07:35.823 --> 07:39.026
(beeps)

07:39.059 --> 07:40.794
Hey.

07:40.828 --> 07:44.031
Hey. Almost done with the,
uh, reconstruction here.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.599
So, how you feeling?

07:45.633 --> 07:47.768
Uh, fine, thanks.
Yeah.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.270
How's, uh, Lucy feel about her
possible baby brother or sister?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.672
She's excited.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.674
That's-that's great.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.809
That's great, you know.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.144
You know, my
brother hated me.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.846
Oh. Just,
he was so...

07:58.879 --> 08:01.214
He was so pissed all the time
that I was there.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.283
He was just, like,
"Here's the little thing..."

08:03.316 --> 08:04.818
(grunting)

08:04.852 --> 08:06.754
Oh, we totally
worked it out.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.756
Uh, I mean, uh,

08:08.789 --> 08:10.223
eventually, it was
totally, totally cool.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.692
It was totally...

08:11.725 --> 08:12.626
Um, anyway,
what do you got?

08:12.660 --> 08:14.762
I have the year,
make and model of the car

08:14.795 --> 08:16.764
if it helps.
That helps a lot. Did you get

08:16.797 --> 08:18.231
the fingerprints
off the taillights?
Microdots.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.133
Thieves are targeting
high-end lenses now,

08:20.167 --> 08:21.769
so manufacturers
are dotting them.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.771
I'm running the VIN
through DMV now.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.073
You gave me the "who,"
I gave you the "how."

08:26.106 --> 08:28.742
Uh. And, um, look.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.644
He wasn't, like, super pissed.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.245
You know?
Oh...

08:32.279 --> 08:35.816
We... we worked it out.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.317
(sighs)

08:37.350 --> 08:40.287
Yo, Mac, want to go
grab a quick slice?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.822
A slice?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.591
Bullets didn't get
a hit in IBIS,

08:43.624 --> 08:46.093
but hospital records gave us
17 guys in their 20s

08:46.126 --> 08:48.261
that lost their gallbladder
last year,

08:48.295 --> 08:50.631
and only one of 'em looked
like our vic.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.801
Paul Tortucci.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.268
Yeah. Lives at Carmine
and Bleecker.

08:55.302 --> 08:58.606
Above Tortucci's Pizzeria.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.073
He bakes pizzas.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.242
Best in the village.

09:10.317 --> 09:14.755
* It's a beautiful night,
all the stars shining bright *

09:14.788 --> 09:19.760
* For my donna molto bella

09:19.793 --> 09:21.695
* The moon's on the rise

09:21.729 --> 09:28.736
* There's a glow in the eyes
of my donna molto bella *

09:28.769 --> 09:31.972
* We drank sparkling prosecco

09:32.005 --> 09:38.178
* And the music is echoing
our favorite tarantella *

09:38.211 --> 09:40.981
* It's a night for amore
(door bells tinkle)

09:41.014 --> 09:44.051
* An affare di cuore
with my donna molto bella... *

09:44.084 --> 09:46.053
Raphael Tortucci?

09:46.086 --> 09:49.022
That's what my mama calls me.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.293
Only when she's angry.
It's Ray.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.195
NYPD.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.997
Hey, New York's finest.
What can I do for you guys?

09:57.030 --> 09:58.732
You want a slice?
Let me give you a slice.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.801
No, thanks. We're
here about Paul?

10:00.834 --> 10:04.137
Paul. Paulie. My nephew?

10:04.171 --> 10:06.740
What? He didn't do
anything wrong, did he?

10:06.774 --> 10:08.308
Why don't we step
over here for a sec?

10:11.078 --> 10:12.880
What's going on?

10:12.913 --> 10:14.882
What do you guys want
to talk about?

10:14.915 --> 10:18.318
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this, but, um,

10:18.351 --> 10:20.287
Paul was found
shot this morning.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.057
Shot? What do you mean,
"found shot"?

10:24.091 --> 10:26.326
I don't know what
you're telling me.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.028
He's okay, right?

10:28.061 --> 10:30.764
I'm sorry.

10:30.798 --> 10:34.668
Paulie... My Paulie's dead?

10:37.104 --> 10:38.839
Why don't you have a seat?

10:38.872 --> 10:41.074
(quietly):
Sit down.

10:42.810 --> 10:43.911
Hold on, now.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.045
He was going snowboarding.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.413
What do you mean he was shot?

10:46.446 --> 10:47.781
He was shot by who?

10:47.815 --> 10:49.349
We don't know that yet.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.385
He lived upstairs?

10:52.419 --> 10:53.921
Yeah.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.156
You know how we can
contact his parents?

10:56.189 --> 10:57.457
Oh, God.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.359
They're dead.

11:00.828 --> 11:04.331
They died 16 years ago.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.767
I promised them
I'd take care of him,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.836
I'd watch over him
like he was my own.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.939
I mean, he was my blood,
he was my boy.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.808
He worked here with you?
Yeah.

11:14.842 --> 11:18.445
After the funeral,
he didn't want to go home.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.913
(chuckles)

11:19.947 --> 11:21.782
He just wanted to hang out
around here and...

11:21.815 --> 11:22.850
and help us, you know?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.151
He was nine years old,

11:24.184 --> 11:25.886
so I-I gave him an apron,

11:25.919 --> 11:27.821
and I put him on a stool, and...

11:27.855 --> 11:29.857
(sniffs)

11:29.890 --> 11:31.124
He worked beside me

11:31.158 --> 11:32.225
since then.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.194
(sighs)

11:34.227 --> 11:35.796
And the trouble,

11:35.829 --> 11:37.931
I mean, bad trouble...

11:37.965 --> 11:41.201
and we're just finally,
we're getting out of the red.

11:41.234 --> 11:44.171
And I was gonna retire...

11:44.204 --> 11:45.773
and I was gonna...

11:45.806 --> 11:47.407
(quietly):
I was gonna leave...

11:47.440 --> 11:50.811
I was gonna leave
the place to...

11:50.844 --> 11:54.147
...all for nothing.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.349
Will you tell me
what happened?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.185
We think he was carjacked.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.054
(softly):
Carjacked?

12:01.088 --> 12:02.522
...talking about?

12:02.555 --> 12:03.991
He had a fender bender,

12:04.024 --> 12:06.393
and they must have
pulled him out of the car,

12:06.426 --> 12:09.429
and they... they shot him
and took his BMW.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.998
Paulie never drove
a car like that

12:11.031 --> 12:12.766
in his entire life.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.134
He drove a piece of crap van.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.368
Now, who would kill
someone over that?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.270
Nobody.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.010
TAYLOR:
We got this all wrong.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.879
The vic was driving the van.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.882
Then he rear-ended the car.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.283
So, the vic's
the carjacker?

12:30.317 --> 12:32.886
Picked a target
that wouldn't give up

12:32.920 --> 12:34.421
without a fight?
(gunshots, grunt)

12:34.454 --> 12:37.557
Except the kid has
a clean record

12:37.590 --> 12:39.292
and his business
was picking up.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.261
Carjacking at gunpoint

12:41.294 --> 12:42.863
feels like a stretch.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.098
Well, maybe it was road
rage on the car's part.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.469
(grunting)

12:49.502 --> 12:50.537
(gunshots)

12:50.570 --> 12:51.538
(groans)

12:51.571 --> 12:53.306
Then why take the van?

12:53.340 --> 12:54.908
That's something
you might want to ask

12:54.942 --> 12:55.742
the owner of the car.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.410
DMV just gave us
a name and address.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.849
(elevator bell dings)

13:01.882 --> 13:03.450
That a new jacket?

13:03.483 --> 13:05.218
Actually, it is.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.920
Well?

13:06.954 --> 13:08.021
It's fine.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.322
Just fine?

13:09.356 --> 13:10.457
Hey,

13:10.490 --> 13:12.125
I'm just being honest.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.126
(Lovato sighs)

13:13.160 --> 13:14.427
(Flack knocks)

13:14.461 --> 13:16.864
NYPD.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.298
(woman groans)

13:18.331 --> 13:19.299
Rowena Black?

13:19.332 --> 13:21.168
In person.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.970
Are you the owner
of a black BMW 528?

13:23.003 --> 13:25.438
Are you gonna give me
a parking ticket?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.539
Where were you this morning?

13:26.573 --> 13:27.941
Here.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.042
Asleep.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.143
Can anybody vouch for that?

13:30.177 --> 13:33.080
You mean, did I sleep
with anyone last night? No.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.315
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Ms. Black.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.250
Your car was involved in a
shooting this morning. A murder.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.352
Wait... what?

13:39.386 --> 13:40.921
My car? You sure?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.055
Positive.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.857
So, unless we can
confirm that story,

13:43.891 --> 13:45.058
we're gonna be talking
at the precinct.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.861
Okay, look, I don't know
what happened.

13:47.895 --> 13:48.896
Last time

13:48.929 --> 13:50.230
I saw my car was three days ago.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.231
I haven't left here

13:51.264 --> 13:53.867
since I did this.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.075
Okay.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.376
Nothing on the car?

14:03.410 --> 14:05.212
Owner says it was stolen.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.346
(laughs):
You believe her?

14:06.379 --> 14:08.648
Well, she has no priors
and her boyfriend checks out.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.183
I'm just hoping we can pick up

14:10.217 --> 14:11.284
her car's anti-theft signal

14:11.318 --> 14:13.020
before it ends up
in a chop shop.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.187
So, what do you have?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.155
Now, what don't I?

14:15.188 --> 14:17.524
All right, I found
four sets of skid marks

14:17.557 --> 14:18.658
at the crash site--
front and rear

14:18.691 --> 14:20.060
for the van,

14:20.093 --> 14:21.128
front and rear
for the car.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.629
Check this out.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.531
The rear skids are lighter
than the fronts,

14:24.564 --> 14:25.665
and the drag sled

14:25.698 --> 14:27.134
gave me a surface
friction value.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.502
Plug everything into
a velocity formula,

14:29.536 --> 14:32.539
and you get a virtual model
of the collision.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.673
Oh.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.375
Eh? Impressed yet?

14:35.408 --> 14:36.944
I'm getting there. Go on.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.145
Behold.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.413
I picked up
faint acceleration marks

14:40.447 --> 14:42.115
starting here,

14:42.149 --> 14:44.952
and shadow marks where the car

14:44.985 --> 14:46.119
swerved sharply.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.155
(engine revving)

14:48.188 --> 14:50.423
Then it started braking here.
(tires screech)

14:50.457 --> 14:51.524
Curving skid marks indicate

14:51.558 --> 14:52.625
the van tried to avoid it,

14:52.659 --> 14:53.994
but no chance.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.195
(tires screech)

14:57.664 --> 14:59.299
The car caused the accident?

14:59.332 --> 15:00.400
Looks that way to me.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.635
Which would mean
the luxury sedan

15:02.669 --> 15:05.038
carjacked the van?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.606
Mm, doesn't make any sense.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.876
MAN:
9-Adam-14.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.379
Two vehicles recovered
at Amsterdam and West 57th.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.414
(siren wailing)

15:18.618 --> 15:21.521
Both the van and the car
are intact.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.056
This isn't about auto theft?

15:23.090 --> 15:25.458
Doesn't look like it.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.460
Looks like our vic
was hitting the slopes, huh?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.396
Found his wallet

15:29.429 --> 15:31.364
in his jacket pocket
along with his passport.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.300
So, maybe he was going somewhere

15:33.333 --> 15:35.068
more than just the Poconos, huh?

15:37.137 --> 15:39.272
According to the stamps
in his passport,

15:39.306 --> 15:41.474
he's been in Canada
four times in the last

15:41.508 --> 15:43.210
five months.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.515
Take a look a this.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.950
Note the matching damage.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.556
Impact site is

15:56.589 --> 15:59.092
19 inches above the ground.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.296
HAWKES:
The van, 23 inches.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.431
FLACK:
So, something

16:04.464 --> 16:06.699
was weighing the van
down when they hit.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.168
DANNY:
Yeah.

16:10.203 --> 16:13.040
Something that isn't
here anymore.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.509
Well, that explains
the hit on our vic.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.179
This kid was delivering
a lot more than pizzas.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.119
*

16:47.274 --> 16:49.276
*

17:14.733 --> 17:16.736
*

17:30.817 --> 17:32.819
*

17:54.741 --> 17:56.876
ROSS:
This is the car,
this is the van.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.711
The red marks are
the point of impact.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.413
When both vehicles are empty,

18:00.447 --> 18:02.682
there's a difference
of 4.3 inches.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.452
Okay, well, we know there
are two people in the car.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.587
Okay, so add the average weight
of two males.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.390
DANVILLE:
And our vic
weighs 174 pounds.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.791
All right, so add that
to the van.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.230
Now, we'll add the weight
of the mysterious cargo.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.466
100 pounds, 200 pounds,

18:19.499 --> 18:20.733
300 pounds,

18:20.767 --> 18:22.302
400 pounds,

18:22.335 --> 18:24.771
533 pounds.

18:26.339 --> 18:30.810
He was smuggling
over 500 pounds... of what?

18:30.843 --> 18:32.379
I don't know.
Could be anything.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.547
Guns, liquor, drugs.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.715
I would go to option C,

18:35.748 --> 18:36.849
since, uh, I didn't
find any prints

18:36.883 --> 18:38.185
in the van,
but I did find

18:38.218 --> 18:40.453
some drug trace-- P.E.A.

18:40.487 --> 18:41.588
That's a mild amphetamine.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.890
500 pounds is a lot of speed.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.627
A lot of reasons
to kill somebody.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.565
DANVILLE:
Not exactly
Tony Montana's mansion.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.869
Paul was probably
just the middleman,

18:56.903 --> 18:59.772
taking a cut like everyone else.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.941
Still,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.810
it looks like
my son's apartment.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.745
He loves sports,

19:05.778 --> 19:07.914
gross-out comedies.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.916
Mom and Dad.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.855
What are you doing here?

19:15.888 --> 19:17.457
What's going on?

19:17.490 --> 19:18.791
We're trying to find

19:18.825 --> 19:20.493
some answers, Ray.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.628
We have a warrant

19:21.661 --> 19:23.196
to search
your nephew's apartment.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.931
For what? Why?
We found

19:24.964 --> 19:26.733
a hidden floor compartment
in your nephew's van.

19:28.235 --> 19:31.238
It was carrying
500 pounds of something.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.772
Looks like he was hoping

19:32.805 --> 19:33.906
to smuggle it into Canada.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.242
What are you talking about?

19:35.275 --> 19:36.643
Wait, hold on,

19:36.676 --> 19:37.777
smuggle what?

19:37.810 --> 19:38.878
We're not sure.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.513
It was gone.

19:40.547 --> 19:44.384
But whoever killed Paul
didn't want the van.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.685
They wanted what was inside it.

19:45.718 --> 19:46.819
I told you,

19:46.853 --> 19:49.856
he was going snowboarding.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.225
He said that Quebec
had the best snow

19:52.259 --> 19:53.726
and the prettiest

19:53.760 --> 19:55.262
girls there.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.929
He bought the van used.
All right?

19:56.963 --> 19:58.665
So, if there was a hidden
compartment in there,

19:58.698 --> 19:59.932
it was there when he bought it.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.534
Look, all right...

20:01.568 --> 20:03.270
Detective,

20:03.303 --> 20:05.338
I know you don't
know me from Adam,

20:05.372 --> 20:06.939
but Paulie, Paulie, he...

20:09.409 --> 20:12.345
he... he wasn't a drug smuggler.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.448
He was a good boy.

20:15.482 --> 20:18.285
TAYLOR:
We found some drug trace
in the van, Ray.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.619
No.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.888
Mac?

20:26.959 --> 20:28.595
There's a couple
of thousand, here.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.002
You know those
little metal pellets

20:36.035 --> 20:38.004
I found on the passenger
mat in the car?

20:40.640 --> 20:42.875
They're castings
from an oxyacetylene torch.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.480
So, our passenger's a welder.
Mm-hmm.

20:47.514 --> 20:50.317
I also found GSR on the outside
of the driver's door.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.584
TAYLOR:
Our driver's the shooter.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.719
(gunshot, grunt)

20:52.752 --> 20:54.454
Tall shooter.
He had his seat

20:54.487 --> 20:56.456
all the way back, I put him at
six foot four and a half.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.890
You know that
from the car seat?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.459
I know that from
his rap sheet.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.761
When he hot-wired the car,
he pricked his finger.

21:01.794 --> 21:02.962
Left a little blood trace.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.931
Reno Martell.

21:04.964 --> 21:05.898
TAYLOR:
Auto theft,

21:05.932 --> 21:08.635
assault with a deadly weapon.
Just got out

21:08.668 --> 21:09.769
of Fishkill.
Yeah.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.638
His P.O. gave us
his last known.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.039
FLACK:
NYPD, open up!

21:20.347 --> 21:21.814
Boom.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.452
(Danny whistles)

21:27.420 --> 21:29.922
Jackpot.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.829
Jack cheese, maybe.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.631
What?

21:38.665 --> 21:41.901
Think we just made
the largest cheese bust

21:41.934 --> 21:44.937
in NYPD history, buddy.
(sniffs, chuckles)

21:52.545 --> 21:54.814
(siren wailing)

21:54.847 --> 21:56.816
DANNY:
It's-it's Martell with

21:56.849 --> 21:59.819
two "L"s. Now, any friends,
any family, known associates.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.388
You know the deal.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.390
Guys, why don't you start
canvassing the building?

22:03.423 --> 22:04.457
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.993
Low-moisture, part-skim
mozzarella.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.795
Same stuff they
use on pizza.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.863
If you had told me this morning
we'd be investigating

22:10.897 --> 22:12.064
a cheese murder,
you know what I would

22:12.098 --> 22:13.400
have said?
Please don't.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.967
"No whey."

22:15.001 --> 22:17.036
(groans)
Thought I said "don't."

22:17.069 --> 22:19.439
I guess this explains
the drug trace

22:19.472 --> 22:22.975
in the van-- this cheese
contains small amounts of P.E.A.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.077
Doc, people don't kill
each other over dairy product.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.779
Which means the perp

22:26.813 --> 22:28.448
thought it was something else.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.417
Maybe that's exactly
what the vic wanted.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.418
I mean,
the way he...

22:31.451 --> 22:32.852
packaged it up, stored it

22:32.885 --> 22:34.687
in a hidden compartment,
maybe he was trying to con

22:34.721 --> 22:36.889
a bunch of people into thinking
he had a whole lot of coke

22:36.923 --> 22:38.491
or heroin, maybe meth?

22:38.525 --> 22:40.927
Yeah, but the buyer caught on
and tapped him.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.530
What about the fender
bender? I mean, if this was

22:43.563 --> 22:45.598
a revenge hit,
why take the cheese?

22:45.632 --> 22:47.634
Yeah.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.673
Does that part of the floor
look cleaner than the rest?

22:53.706 --> 22:56.909
Yeah, since when does someone
clean a dump like this?

23:05.518 --> 23:07.720
Yeah.

23:07.754 --> 23:11.424
When they've spilled
a lot of blood.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.564
You're here to tell me it was
the mozzarell, aren't you?

23:18.898 --> 23:20.767
You knew about that?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.168
If I did,

23:22.201 --> 23:25.438
Paulie would probably
still be alive today.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.640
I just figured it out.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.642
We think maybe he was
trying to con someone.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.644
Make them think
he was selling them drugs.

23:31.678 --> 23:32.879
RAY:
He wasn't trying

23:32.912 --> 23:34.747
to con anyone.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.449
He was just trying
to make a few bucks.

23:39.185 --> 23:42.755
Couple years ago, some Canadian
greaseballs came in here,

23:42.789 --> 23:45.091
and-and they start going on
and on about the cheese,

23:45.124 --> 23:46.358
how it's cheaper here
and more expensive there.

23:46.392 --> 23:49.462
They said if I could figure out
a way to get it over the border,

23:49.496 --> 23:51.798
I could make four bucks a pound.

23:51.831 --> 23:52.865
Smuggling cheese?

23:52.899 --> 23:55.602
Low risk, high reward.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.604
(chuckles)
"White gold,"

23:57.637 --> 24:00.206
they'd call it.
But that stuff never

24:00.239 --> 24:01.774
flies with me,
so I threw 'em out.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.943
And I never thought
about it again.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.479
Until you found that money
in the apartment.

24:06.513 --> 24:07.880
You went through the books?

24:08.915 --> 24:10.216
(sighing):
Yeah.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.684
Last year,

24:11.718 --> 24:13.252
we were doing really bad.
We were in trouble.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.887
It was grinding me down.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.989
So when Paulie offered
to take over the books,

24:17.023 --> 24:19.191
believe me, I was thrilled.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.661
But turns out he was good at it.

24:21.694 --> 24:25.064
I mean, he raised some prices,
he lowered some costs.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.132
Before long,

24:26.165 --> 24:27.667
we were showing
a profit again,

24:27.700 --> 24:30.570
and I had no reason
to look at the books.

24:30.603 --> 24:31.804
(sighs)
Here.

24:31.838 --> 24:35.942
These are my dairy purchase
orders for the last five months.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.010
Paulie went
from ordering 200 pounds

24:38.044 --> 24:40.547
of mozzarella a month
to 700 pounds.

24:40.580 --> 24:44.551
These delivery dates
are consistently a day or two

24:44.584 --> 24:47.887
before the dates of the Canadian
border entries in Paul's

24:47.920 --> 24:49.021
passport.
And...

24:49.055 --> 24:52.291
the delivery times are all late
in the day, after 6:00.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.127
Yeah. I had the lunch shift,
Paulie had dinner.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.263
I was gone every day by 6:00.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.532
He was getting
a little action on the side--

24:59.566 --> 25:01.133
couple of thousand a month.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.905
Yeah, I guess that's
what it would look like.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.908
But that's just not Paulie.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.177
So I looked at everything,

25:11.210 --> 25:12.979
and then I realized

25:13.012 --> 25:14.714
none of it was adding up.

25:14.747 --> 25:17.249
For the last five months,
the daily receipts

25:17.283 --> 25:19.719
aren't even synching
with the final balances.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.654
You think he was skimming
from the till?

25:23.355 --> 25:25.692
He was adding to it.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.562
$50 here, $70 there.
Little bit every day.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.766
That's what was putting you
in the black.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.535
And that's why we found
that cash in his place.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.740
He knew that...

25:40.773 --> 25:45.745
I would never retire as long
as this place was in the red.

25:45.778 --> 25:49.148
(voice cracking):
He was doing it all for me.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.153
Excuse me.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.155
You think he really didn't know?

25:56.188 --> 25:58.290
That this is the first time
he heard about it?

25:58.324 --> 26:02.261
Yeah. Something isn't
sitting right.

26:02.294 --> 26:05.297
The perps stole a car,
stage an accident,

26:05.331 --> 26:07.299
commit murder?

26:07.333 --> 26:08.334
That's a lot
of downside

26:08.367 --> 26:10.169
for a few thousand dollars.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.778
We thought it was drugs.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.079
Someone else did, too.

26:21.948 --> 26:24.917
Ray said Paul always backed
the van up right here.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.687
Which means this is where
he must've loaded the bundles.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.392
What if someone
happened to see him?

26:33.425 --> 26:35.194
Saw him

26:35.227 --> 26:37.664
loading those white bricks
wrapped in tape

26:37.697 --> 26:39.666
into a secret compartment
at night.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.367
It'd be pretty easy
to think he was loading

26:41.400 --> 26:42.835
a whole bunch of cocaine.

26:42.869 --> 26:45.104
Worth a few million bucks.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.039
Plenty of motive to kill.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.776
No foot traffic, any vehicles
would be conspicuous.

26:56.082 --> 26:59.652
TAYLOR:
Let's go pay
George a visit.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.654
(tool ratcheting)

27:04.924 --> 27:07.794
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

27:08.828 --> 27:09.996
Last time

27:10.029 --> 27:13.332
a cop asked me questions,
I ended up doing three months.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.334
What do you know about
your neighbors the Tortuccis?

27:15.367 --> 27:18.437
They make pizzas? Look,

27:18.470 --> 27:20.072
I'm kind of slammed here.
What's this about?

27:20.106 --> 27:21.407
The nephew, Paul, was murdered

27:21.440 --> 27:23.409
this morning.
(sighs)

27:23.442 --> 27:26.779
Are you serious?

27:26.813 --> 27:28.848
I mean, I went in there
now and then.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.117
I don't know.
He seemed like a good kid.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.085
Where were you
this morning?

27:33.119 --> 27:35.187
And here we go.
(chuckles)

27:35.221 --> 27:36.689
You know, I knew

27:36.723 --> 27:37.790
that was gonna be next.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.059
I don't know anything
about that.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.060
Then you shouldn't
have any problem

27:41.093 --> 27:42.061
telling us where you were.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.696
Same place I am every morning:

27:43.730 --> 27:45.464
at Nico's on the corner
having coffee.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.799
What time was that?

27:46.833 --> 27:48.200
5:00. And you can ask him

27:48.234 --> 27:49.301
if you don't believe me.

27:49.335 --> 27:50.803
We will.

27:51.437 --> 27:52.905
Mind if we

27:52.939 --> 27:53.973
look around?

27:54.006 --> 27:55.808
Without a warrant?

27:55.842 --> 27:57.443
Yeah, I do.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.345
Well, if we come back
with a warrant,

27:59.378 --> 28:01.080
we're gonna go
through every single part

28:01.113 --> 28:02.414
in this place, and for every

28:02.448 --> 28:04.383
missing or unmatched
VIN we find,

28:04.416 --> 28:06.018
you'll be doing
another three months.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.386
Looks like

28:07.419 --> 28:08.755
that could add up pretty fast.

28:08.788 --> 28:11.090
Knock yourselves out.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.929
*

28:44.824 --> 28:47.426
*

29:11.417 --> 29:13.352
Hey, Jo.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.254
Yeah.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.996
Perfect view.

29:25.331 --> 29:29.235
So what? You think I've been
spying on the pizza boy?

29:29.268 --> 29:31.237
Looks like
somebody has.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.239
Those are Felipe's.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.041
Who's Felipe?

29:35.074 --> 29:36.242
He works here.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.376
Where is he?

29:37.409 --> 29:38.911
Taking a "me" day.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.980
He can weld
like a son of a bitch.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.415
If he could speak English
and learn to show up for work,

29:43.449 --> 29:44.516
he'd be a rock star.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.886
All right.
Felipe have a last name?

29:54.193 --> 29:56.228
Felipe Zacharias is in the wind.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.164
Chop shop guy's alibi
checked out,

29:58.197 --> 30:00.066
so I'm liking Felipe
for this.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.200
You think he's
our welder?

30:01.233 --> 30:02.334
Yeah, and Martell's
accomplice.

30:02.368 --> 30:05.004
Unfortunately Felipe's not
in the system, any system.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.172
Probably illegal.

30:06.205 --> 30:07.306
Which explains

30:07.339 --> 30:10.042
why the DNA from the cigarette
butts I ran through CODIS

30:10.076 --> 30:13.412
didn't get a hit.
Ah, neither did the blood
on Martell's floor,

30:13.445 --> 30:14.981
so I'm guessing that
could be Felipe's, too.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.349
Good guess because I ran
the blood and the DNA

30:17.383 --> 30:18.717
against each other
and got a match.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.353
(phone chimes)
Sounds like Felipe and
Martell had a falling out.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.590
And Felipe lost.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.579
Got it.
Thank you.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.417
Ticket-taker says this bin
was emptied yesterday

30:51.450 --> 30:52.518
sometime around noon.

30:52.551 --> 30:56.055
So that means Felipe was dumped
sometime after that.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.256
Makes sense.
Body temp is ambient.

30:57.289 --> 30:58.657
That puts time of death
between 24

30:58.690 --> 31:00.326
and 36 hours ago.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.461
We got
two stab wounds.

31:02.494 --> 31:05.898
Deep. Explains all the blood
at Martell's SRO.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.071
Also...

31:12.104 --> 31:15.207
couple of defensive wounds
there...

31:15.241 --> 31:18.911
and here.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's that?

31:21.213 --> 31:22.214
What?

31:22.248 --> 31:23.449
On his shirt.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.319
(sighs)

31:34.160 --> 31:36.162
A matchbook.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.696
So if the Dumpster

31:37.729 --> 31:40.232
was empty except for the body,

31:40.266 --> 31:42.468
this belongs to either Felipe...

31:46.538 --> 31:48.340
Or Martell.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.119
(rock music playing,
pool cue strikes ball)

32:00.152 --> 32:01.587
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:03.289 --> 32:06.125
I'm really starting to feel
like we're wasting our time.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.994
The bartender said
that Martell's been here

32:08.027 --> 32:08.995
almost every day.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.662
Bartender's a drunk--
he sees a lot of things

32:10.696 --> 32:11.663
in here almost every day.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.365
It ha been a few hours.

32:13.399 --> 32:14.366
Come on.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.602
And don't say I never
take you anywhere nice.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.037
Hold on.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.143
* Lock and load

32:24.176 --> 32:25.411
* Lock and load *

32:25.444 --> 32:27.146
* Lock and load

32:27.179 --> 32:29.281
* Lock and load... *

32:29.315 --> 32:30.682
Reno Martell.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.584
Police.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.463
All right! Drop it!

32:46.065 --> 32:47.599
Cheese?

32:47.633 --> 32:50.502
You murdered two guys
over some cheese?

32:50.536 --> 32:52.738
I'm thinking you better come up
with a better story,

32:52.771 --> 32:54.306
because when you're
doing consecutive life,

32:54.340 --> 32:55.641
you don't want anyone to know

32:55.674 --> 32:58.310
it was over
a bunch of mozzarella.
Hey...

32:58.344 --> 32:59.678
hey, listen to me.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.048
I didn't murder anyone,
all right?

33:02.081 --> 33:04.350
This was all Felipe.
It was his idea.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.652
He stole the car.
He capped the guy.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.654
He attacked me with a knife.

33:08.687 --> 33:12.358
The only thing I'm guilty of
is listening to a moron.

33:12.391 --> 33:15.194
Well, you ran like you were
guilty of a lot more than that.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.096
I don't trust cops.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.264
LOVATO:
It sounds to me like

33:18.297 --> 33:19.665
maybe you were just
having a bad day

33:19.698 --> 33:20.666
where everything
goes wrong.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.368
Exactly.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.070
So why don't you
walk us through it?

33:24.103 --> 33:25.571
Starting with how
you knew Felipe.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.341
I sold him a car.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.043
I'm, like,
a car dealer, you know?

33:31.077 --> 33:34.146
Wow. One car deal and you guys
are thick as thieves.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.314
Eh, he was new
to the States,

33:35.347 --> 33:37.583
he didn't know a lot of people.

33:37.616 --> 33:41.120
Ah. You're, like, a...
one-man Ellis Island?

33:41.153 --> 33:42.821
You must've made an
impression on him,

33:42.854 --> 33:44.723
because as soon as he came
across an opportunity,

33:44.756 --> 33:46.292
you were the
one he called.
Yeah.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.627
He said he'd been watching
this pizza guy next-door.

33:48.660 --> 33:49.795
Paul Tortucci.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.797
Yeah. He said
he saw him

33:51.830 --> 33:54.366
loading something
into his van late at night.

33:58.570 --> 34:02.641
Then a couple weeks later, he
sees the very same thing again.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.843
It's, like, a regular thing.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.646
Only this time
he sees a bit more.

34:07.679 --> 34:11.516
He sees these big white bricks,
and he's hiding them

34:11.550 --> 34:15.754
in this trapdoor he's got
in the floor of his van.

34:15.786 --> 34:17.656
So you figured
it was cocaine.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.092
That's what Felipe said
it was-- a ton of it.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.393
A friggin' fortune.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.663
So anyway, Felipe picks me up

34:24.696 --> 34:26.697
in this sweet ride
he's just boosted.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.300
Hang on a sec.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.735
Felipe was driving?

34:29.768 --> 34:31.137
You sure?

34:31.170 --> 34:33.272
There was a steering wheel
in front of him.

34:33.304 --> 34:34.672
So yeah, I'm sure.

34:34.706 --> 34:35.741
LOVATO:
So, you waited at the pizzeria

34:35.774 --> 34:38.543
for your guy to drive away,
and then you follow?

34:38.577 --> 34:40.411
We waited till we found
a nice, quiet street.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.281
FLACK:
Then you cut him off.
It was just a fender bender.

34:42.313 --> 34:44.150
We just wanted to stop the guy.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.384
Then all hell breaks loose.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.585
Right away, Felipe
jumps out of the car

34:47.619 --> 34:49.188
and rushes the van.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.556
Then out of nowhere,

34:50.589 --> 34:52.291
he pulls out a gun.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.792
I didn't even know
he was carrying.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.827
That wasn't part
of the plan?
Hell, no.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.697
(wry chuckle)
I wasn't worried
about the guy rattin' us.

34:58.730 --> 35:01.167
He was running coke!
But Felipe,

35:01.200 --> 35:03.302
he was on his
own planet.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.771
He puts two in the guy's chest,
just like that.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.873
So, Felipe dragged Tortucci
out of the van

35:07.906 --> 35:10.576
and tagged him right
in the middle of the street.

35:10.609 --> 35:11.877
Swear to God.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.445
We got the hell
out of there.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.881
We drove back to Felipe's car,
we unload the van,

35:15.914 --> 35:18.350
and then we head to my place.
You thought

35:18.384 --> 35:20.586
you hit the mother lode.
Hell, yeah.

35:20.619 --> 35:24.356
I'm thinking Felipe's
a friggin' genius.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.892
So was he.
He keeps saying,

35:26.925 --> 35:29.495
"I told you so,
I told you so,"

35:29.528 --> 35:31.797
over and over again,
like a crazy man.

35:31.830 --> 35:32.931
Then you cut it open.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.267
He... cut it open.

35:35.301 --> 35:38.404
It was his score,
it's his honors.

35:38.437 --> 35:39.905
What's the trouble?

35:44.276 --> 35:45.711
(loud grunt)

35:45.744 --> 35:46.945
FLACK:
You must've been pretty pissed

35:46.978 --> 35:48.514
when you saw
what was inside.

35:48.547 --> 35:51.383
I didn't have time
to get pissed.

35:51.417 --> 35:54.420
(wry chuckle)
Felipe went nuts.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.922
He was just so... wired.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.524
You know?

35:58.557 --> 36:02.461
A-And then when he saw
that it was... cheese...

36:02.494 --> 36:06.598
that he just murdered a guy
for friggin' cheese...

36:06.632 --> 36:08.467
he lost it.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.868
FLACK:
So he turned on you?

36:09.901 --> 36:14.373
MARTELL:
He would've turned
on his own mother.

36:14.406 --> 36:17.509
It was totally self-defense.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.611
It was just like she said.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.383
Just one of those days.

36:27.819 --> 36:29.855
You know, I think
I believe him.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.524
Oh, like you've never
had one of those days?

36:32.558 --> 36:35.394
So his ended in
murder-- you gonna
hold it against him?

36:35.427 --> 36:38.964
(chuckles)
We'll try and keep an open mind.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.469
(door opens)

36:43.502 --> 36:45.237
(door closes)

36:48.707 --> 36:50.676
Who are
you guys?

36:50.709 --> 36:53.479
We're the guys you're
gonna tell the truth to.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.283
Oh, come on,
I just told the whole story

36:57.316 --> 36:59.285
to the other two...
Let's start

36:59.318 --> 37:00.686
with the stolen car.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.521
When we found it,
the driver's seat

37:02.554 --> 37:04.590
was pushed all the way back.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.326
Now, if Felipe was driving,
that would be very strange

37:07.359 --> 37:08.960
because he's only five seven.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.228
You know what's
even stranger?

37:10.262 --> 37:13.699
When Felipe hot-wired the car,
he left your blood

37:13.732 --> 37:15.334
on the ignition wire.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.305
Like she said,
we're the guys.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.843
So maybe I boosted the car.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.512
(chuckles)

37:26.545 --> 37:28.847
And yeah, I was driving;
big deal.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.516
See?

37:30.549 --> 37:32.984
I can be real with you guys.
Good.

37:33.018 --> 37:35.587
Good, 'cause there's more--
we found gunshot residue

37:35.621 --> 37:37.756
on the outside
of the door of the car.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.858
The driver's-side door--
you know, the one

37:39.891 --> 37:40.859
with the steering wheel?

37:40.892 --> 37:42.894
Look, th-this is all messed up.

37:42.928 --> 37:43.995
There were witnesses

37:44.029 --> 37:46.498
who said that nobody
jumped out of the car

37:46.532 --> 37:47.666
(snaps fingers)
right away.

37:47.699 --> 37:48.534
I don't know.
I don't know.

37:48.567 --> 37:51.737
TAYLOR:
Then let me clarify it for you.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.004
You forced the crash.

37:53.038 --> 37:55.874
Paul gets out, comes
over to your car.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.743
Maybe he wants
to know what happened.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.445
Maybe he just wants to see

37:59.478 --> 38:00.479
if you're okay.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.681
You open the window
and shoot him, point-blank.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.916
No!

38:04.950 --> 38:07.586
I didn't want to shoot the guy.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.887
The idiot

38:08.920 --> 38:11.089
grabbed for my gun.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.424
We fought
and, you know,

38:12.458 --> 38:14.326
(gunshot, grunting)
it went off.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.794
DANVILLE:
So it was self-defense?

38:15.827 --> 38:17.496
Yeah. I swear.

38:17.529 --> 38:18.530
Just like Felipe.

38:18.564 --> 38:19.831
Exactly.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.833
You have very thin walls
in your place.

38:21.867 --> 38:23.369
Neighbors said
they heard yelling.

38:23.402 --> 38:26.405
Yeah, yeah, like I told him,
Felipe, h-he went crazy.

38:26.438 --> 38:29.575
Except the person yelling
was speaking English.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.677
And Felipe's English
wasn't very good, was it?

38:31.710 --> 38:33.044
We-we were both yelling.

38:33.078 --> 38:35.681
I mean, he-he came at me
with a knife.

38:35.714 --> 38:38.116
Except he had defensive wounds
and you don't.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.387
(pounds table)
He was freakin' moron,
all right?!

38:41.420 --> 38:44.390
Who mistakes cheese
for coke?! Who?!

38:44.423 --> 38:46.658
I just... I lost it!

38:46.692 --> 38:48.860
After all I'd just done...

38:57.403 --> 38:59.905
(chuckles)
You know...

38:59.938 --> 39:00.939
the good thing is,

39:00.972 --> 39:02.073
you won't be having

39:02.107 --> 39:04.476
any more of those days
for a long time.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.720
(siren wailing in distance)

39:21.527 --> 39:23.495
(man singing in Italian)

39:23.529 --> 39:25.997
(door bells tinkle)

39:30.135 --> 39:31.837
Hey, Ray.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.405
Hey, Detective.

39:33.439 --> 39:35.741
How about that slice?

39:38.109 --> 39:40.446
I was thinking maybe
I sell the place.

39:40.479 --> 39:42.481
(clicks tongue)

39:42.514 --> 39:44.516
This... I don't know,

39:44.550 --> 39:47.018
I don't think
I'm ready to let it go yet.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.588
Hard to let go
of a lot of things.

39:49.621 --> 39:52.991
I keep thinking
about the promise

39:53.024 --> 39:54.993
I made my brother,

39:55.026 --> 39:57.095
that I would always

39:57.128 --> 39:59.731
look after Paulie.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.733
That's on me.

40:01.767 --> 40:05.504
We found something
in Paul's van.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.912
(soft crying)

40:16.014 --> 40:19.585
When this little boy
came back from his
parents' funeral,

40:19.618 --> 40:22.020
he was confused, lost...

40:22.053 --> 40:23.755
scared.

40:23.789 --> 40:27.659
Kid like that can go wrong
in a whole lot of ways.

40:29.528 --> 40:32.130
But instead, he turned
into a hardworking,

40:32.163 --> 40:34.533
devoted, caring young man,

40:34.566 --> 40:36.602
a good man.

40:38.670 --> 40:41.439
That's on you, Ray.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.675
(sighs)

40:44.943 --> 40:47.212
You never let anyone down.

40:49.548 --> 40:50.916
Look at him.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.718
He's covered in flour.

40:52.751 --> 40:55.854
(laughing):
Every time...

40:55.887 --> 40:58.657
he'd sneeze up a storm.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.225
(sighs):
Oh...

41:00.258 --> 41:03.061
We'd always have
to start over.
For every...

41:03.094 --> 41:06.898
every one piece he made,
I... I'd throw away four.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.168
(soft groan)

41:10.201 --> 41:12.538
Thank you, Detective.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.072
(Italian song continues)

41:14.105 --> 41:15.907
(choked up):
Thank you.
