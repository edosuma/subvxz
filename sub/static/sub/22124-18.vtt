Go wait in the car.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.550
Seriously,
what were you thinking

09:10.593 --> 09:13.030
letting a drunken rocker
sleep in Trixie'’s bed?

09:13.074 --> 09:15.598
I was thinking
he was too drunk

09:15.642 --> 09:17.687
to make it up the stairs
to Chloe'’s bed.

09:17.731 --> 09:18.906
What'’s the big deal?

09:18.949 --> 09:20.255
The big deal, Maze,

09:20.298 --> 09:21.996
is that you live
with a nine-year-old.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.737
It'’s not okay.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.914
Ooh... did I make Dan mad?

09:26.957 --> 09:29.307
Why are you...

09:29.351 --> 09:31.048
Are you going through
something lately?

09:31.092 --> 09:32.876
Other than the band, no.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.009
Fine.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.793
Whatever.
Clean up.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.230
I don'’t want to have to
tell Chloe about this.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.493
She has enough
on her plate right now.

09:41.537 --> 09:42.712
You know, there
are some things

09:42.756 --> 09:44.671
I could tell Chloe, too.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.629
[sighs]
Like what?

09:46.673 --> 09:47.891
Like...

09:47.935 --> 09:50.720
remember when we had
a guy killed?

09:50.764 --> 09:52.809
Yeah.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.550
That was fun.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.293
Seems we both have things
we'’d rather Chloe not know.

09:58.336 --> 10:03.211
Look, I don'’t know what's
going on with you right now,

10:03.254 --> 10:06.475
but whatever it is...
figure it out.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.656
Emma Mathews just
got brought in.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.266
And Emma Matthews is...

10:15.310 --> 10:16.398
The victim'’s wife.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.878
Right.
Yes, of course.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.054
Well, mustn'’t keep the
murderous lady waiting.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.403
Mind if I join?

10:21.446 --> 10:23.797
You sure?
You don'’t have to.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.189
I know.
I want to.

10:25.233 --> 10:28.062
Great.
The more the merrier.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.673
Uh... I know what
you'’re doing.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.370
I'’m getting ready to
question a suspect.

10:32.414 --> 10:33.676
And I hate to break it
to you, Kane,

10:33.720 --> 10:34.895
but there'’s only
room for one immortal

10:34.938 --> 10:36.505
in the detective'’s life,

10:36.548 --> 10:38.463
and that position'’s
already been filled.
By you.

10:38.507 --> 10:41.641
The detective and I are a team--
a package deal, if you will.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.078
Sadly, there'’s just no room
for a third.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.688
And I don'’t understand why

10:45.732 --> 10:47.429
you'’re trying to spend time
with her anyway.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.909
What happened to the whole
wanting to die thing?

10:48.952 --> 10:50.084
I had a change of heart.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.476
I'’m sorry if I upset you.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.869
I didn'’t think you two
were a thing.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.001
We'’re not a thing.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.698
We'’re partners.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.134
Well, if that'’s all it is,
then you'’ve got nothing

10:57.178 --> 10:58.222
to worry about, do you?

10:58.266 --> 11:00.616
[stammers]:
Wait...

11:00.660 --> 11:02.009
Right.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.619
Yeah.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.014
[grunts]

11:07.057 --> 11:09.190
Fine, fine.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.583
I prefer standing anyway.

11:11.627 --> 11:12.889
CHLOE:
Emma,

11:12.933 --> 11:14.761
four months ago, your
husband reported that

11:14.804 --> 11:17.285
you slashed his tires.
Then two months ago,

11:17.328 --> 11:20.244
neighbors saw you throwing
rocks through his window.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.768
And then just last month,

11:21.811 --> 11:23.944
you were seen threatening
him with a bat.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.336
Can you explain that?

11:26.686 --> 11:31.255
Look, I'’m not proud
of what happened.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.779
But I was upset.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.738
I just found out
Robbie was cheating on me.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.131
Well, completely understandable.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.741
I mean, what else
are you supposed to do

11:38.785 --> 11:41.831
when some parasite inserts
himself into your relationship?

11:41.875 --> 11:44.399
So is that why you did this?

11:44.442 --> 11:46.618
What?
[inhales sharply]

11:46.662 --> 11:47.837
Is this for real?

11:49.404 --> 11:53.364
I... admit I hated Rachel,

11:53.408 --> 11:55.366
but I would never hurt Robbie.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.673
I-I may have gone
a little nuts

11:57.717 --> 11:59.544
when I learned
he was cheating, but...

11:59.588 --> 12:01.982
after the courts forced me
into therapy,

12:02.025 --> 12:03.810
we started talking.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.986
We chose to divorce amicably.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.336
Oh, God.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.424
I can'’t believe he's dead.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.686
This is preposterous.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.427
Do you really
expect us to believe

12:12.470 --> 12:15.517
that you were okay with someone
tearing you two apart?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.127
It'’s the truth.Does the name

12:17.171 --> 12:19.826
Clark Hoffman
mean anything to you?

12:19.869 --> 12:21.566
Who?
[shuddering breath]

12:21.610 --> 12:23.481
I know we'’re gonna check out
her alibi,

12:23.525 --> 12:25.048
but my gut tells me
to believe her.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.050
Oh, please. Just '’cause
she spouted some drivel

12:27.094 --> 12:28.660
about conscious uncoupling?

12:28.704 --> 12:30.706
Because she has no idea
who the Broken Hearts Killer is

12:30.750 --> 12:32.447
and she has no motive
to go after Robbie.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.796
Well, she'’s
obviously lying,

12:33.840 --> 12:35.667
about her relationships
and the murders.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.321
Please tell me I'’m not
the only one who sees that.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.758
Detective?I think we can'’t take

12:38.801 --> 12:41.238
Emma'’s word at face value.Mm-hmm.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.587
DAN: We don'’t have to.
Another couple

12:42.631 --> 12:44.067
was just found dead
holding hands.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.286
This time
at a cheap motel.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.809
The Safari Inn.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.594
[sighs] This isn'’t just
a lovers'’ quarrel.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.248
No, you'’re right.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.772
The copycat'’s
just getting started.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.295
Lieutenant, we need you
on this case.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.949
[stammers, sighs]

12:57.080 --> 12:59.735
And I normally love threesomes.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.134
[indistinct chatter]

13:08.570 --> 13:12.966
Meet Mary Lee
and Dennis Horn.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.446
Just like our first lovers,
they were drugged unconscious

13:15.490 --> 13:17.797
before the killer took something
really big and really hard

13:17.840 --> 13:18.972
and literally...

13:19.015 --> 13:20.712
Bludgeoned their hearts.Mm-hmm.

13:20.756 --> 13:23.411
And then moved them here
and staged this whole scene.

13:23.454 --> 13:26.022
And just like the other victims,
one of them'’s married.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.763
She'’s got a tan line
on her ring finger.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.112
ELLA: We actually
ended up finding

13:29.156 --> 13:30.635
a wedding ring inside
the first victim,

13:30.679 --> 13:33.638
so good bet we'’ll
probably find one here, too.

13:33.682 --> 13:34.988
Any other evidence?

13:35.031 --> 13:36.641
ELLA: More like
lack thereof.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.034
Place was wiped clean,

13:38.078 --> 13:39.296
just like the
first crime scene.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.950
I mean, this
killer, you guys,

13:40.994 --> 13:43.779
whoever he--
or she-- is,

13:43.823 --> 13:44.867
total pro.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.434
Well, Emma'’s alibi checks out.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.653
There'’s no obvious connection
between the couples.

13:48.697 --> 13:51.091
I just wonder how the killer'’s
picking his targets.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.788
Well, Lieutenant,

13:52.832 --> 13:54.703
as our resident
Broken Hearts expert,

13:54.746 --> 13:57.140
wouldn'’t you say it's time to
enlighten us with your wisdom?

13:57.184 --> 14:00.230
No one knew how the original
killer chose his victims.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.580
I guess we just got lucky
we caught him when we did.

14:02.624 --> 14:03.712
"We"?

14:03.755 --> 14:05.366
The LAPD.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.324
CHLOE: We don'’t have time
for luck. We got to get back

14:07.368 --> 14:08.848
to the station,
figure out a connection

14:08.891 --> 14:10.197
between these victims.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.546
Yes, I couldn'’t agree more,
Detective.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.330
After all,
the sooner we finish this case,

14:13.374 --> 14:16.507
the sooner things
can allgo back to normal.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.510
Oof.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.078
Gnarly.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.603
[camera shutter clicks]

14:25.647 --> 14:27.562
[easy jazz piano playing]

14:32.480 --> 14:34.743
WOMAN: You'’re
burning my table.

14:34.786 --> 14:35.831
Hmm?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.181
Oh, I'’m sorry.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.574
Um...

14:39.617 --> 14:42.098
You don'’t ever take
a moment to stop, do you?

14:42.142 --> 14:44.013
No rest for the wicked,

14:44.057 --> 14:46.233
so no rest for me, either.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.891
I'’ve got you
figured out, you know.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.022
You do, huh?

14:53.066 --> 14:54.937
You could work anywhere--

14:54.981 --> 14:56.417
your office, your home,

14:56.460 --> 14:58.375
but you choose
to work in this bar.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.594
Why?

14:59.637 --> 15:01.074
I like a stiff drink?

15:01.117 --> 15:03.903
Because you don'’t actually
want to be alone.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.730
Then why do I sit by myself?

15:05.774 --> 15:07.950
Maybe you feel like you
don'’t deserve the company.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.735
Well, look who'’s
a detective now.

15:10.779 --> 15:13.173
[chuckles]

15:13.216 --> 15:14.914
So, what are you
spending all these

15:14.957 --> 15:16.393
lonesome hours on, anyway?

15:16.437 --> 15:17.612
I'’m working on trying
to find the guy

15:17.655 --> 15:18.961
who kills cheating couples.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.789
The Broken Hearts Killer?

15:20.832 --> 15:22.443
That'’s what they call him.

15:22.486 --> 15:25.272
Six crime scenes,
not one shred of evidence.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.317
It'’s like I'm looking
for clues that don'’t exist.

15:27.361 --> 15:29.319
It never ceases to amaze me,

15:29.363 --> 15:30.973
the lengths people will go to

15:31.017 --> 15:32.540
when they want to make
something just right.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.759
What do you mean?

15:34.803 --> 15:36.936
Like when people
come into the bar

15:36.979 --> 15:38.241
for a special occasion,

15:38.285 --> 15:40.896
like a birthday
or a proposal.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.593
Sometimes they'’ll come
in here days ahead of time

15:42.637 --> 15:44.291
just to make sure
everything'’s perfect.

15:44.334 --> 15:47.381
Maybe it'’s the same for

15:47.424 --> 15:49.426
whoever this Broken
Hearts guy is.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.953
All right, Lieutenant,
what did you want to show us?I may have a lead.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.955
Ah, did you find it
during A.V. Club?

15:55.998 --> 15:57.434
We already know
the killer disabled

15:57.478 --> 15:59.001
the hotel'’s
surveillance cameras.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.524
On the day
of the murders, yes,

16:00.568 --> 16:02.613
but then I started thinking
what if the killer

16:02.657 --> 16:04.964
scoped out the location
a week before?

16:05.007 --> 16:07.096
And I found this.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.011
CHLOE:
Wait, is that...Our guy? Maybe.

16:09.055 --> 16:13.015
The car'’s registered to a Neil
Berger, former schoolteacher.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.452
Well, that'’s it,
a chap snapping photos?

16:15.496 --> 16:17.193
How do we know
he'’s not scrapbooking?

16:17.237 --> 16:19.282
I put an APB out on him, and...[phone chimes]

16:20.196 --> 16:21.981
We just got a hit.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.547
He'’s been spotted in front
of the original killer'’s house.

16:23.591 --> 16:24.331
Let'’s go.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.986
We-Well, that'’s...

16:27.029 --> 16:29.379
actually quite promising.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.430
[knock at door]

16:38.432 --> 16:39.476
Hi.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.306
Listen, I know we'’re not
exactly speaking right now,

16:43.350 --> 16:44.786
but there'’s something
that I need to tell you.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.353
Okay.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.920
Now, don'’t freak out, but, uh,

16:48.964 --> 16:50.531
Charlotte Richards is back.

16:50.574 --> 16:51.967
Oh...

16:52.011 --> 16:54.013
But you have absolutely
nothing to worry about, Linda.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.537
She'’s not, uh...
[sighs]

16:56.580 --> 16:58.365
You know,
she'’s not Mom anymore.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.758
Wow.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.282
It'’s really kind of you

17:02.325 --> 17:04.023
to come all the way
over here to tell me that.

17:04.066 --> 17:08.201
I mean, especially...
when you must be dealing with...

17:08.244 --> 17:09.463
such a shock yourself.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.769
You knew, didn'’t you?

17:11.813 --> 17:14.076
I may have run into Charlotte

17:14.120 --> 17:16.078
a few times--
I don'’t know,

17:16.122 --> 17:18.559
maybe... here.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.082
You'’re treating her, Linda?

17:20.126 --> 17:22.084
You didn'’t think,

17:22.128 --> 17:24.086
just once,

17:24.130 --> 17:26.915
that maybe I had the right
to know that she was alive?

17:26.958 --> 17:28.699
I assumed you knew.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.096
Well, maybe you can help me.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.621
[camera shutter clicks]For the last time, man,

17:37.665 --> 17:40.276
please, pleasequit taking
pictures of my house!

17:40.320 --> 17:41.712
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Yourhouse?

17:41.756 --> 17:43.453
You'’re lucky you get
to livehere, okay?

17:43.497 --> 17:45.238
This place should be
a freakin'’ landmark by now!

17:45.281 --> 17:46.761
Do you know who lived here?
A great artist, man.

17:46.804 --> 17:47.979
Who are you?!

17:48.023 --> 17:49.242
Seriously, last warning, dude.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.591
Next time,
I'’m calling the cops.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.027
Call the cops.
They'’ll be on my side.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.202
Oh, whatever.

17:53.246 --> 17:55.639
Neil Berger?
Yeah.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.599
Wow. Sorry you had
to witness that.

17:58.642 --> 17:59.948
Um, bah.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.950
Okay, who'’s ready?

18:01.993 --> 18:03.430
Ready for what?

18:03.473 --> 18:06.128
For the wonder that is
the Broken Hearts Tour.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.609
Duh. You guys are
my 3:00, right?

18:08.652 --> 18:10.393
Uh-huh.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.265
All right, all right.
Let'’s get some ponchos on you.

18:12.308 --> 18:15.268
When I ran into Charlotte,
I-I-I may have mentioned

18:15.311 --> 18:16.921
a few things that
I shouldn'’t have.

18:16.965 --> 18:20.577
But by the time I realized
that she wasn'’t Mom...

18:20.621 --> 18:21.796
it was too late.

18:21.839 --> 18:22.971
Oh, no.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.364
You know, she was just
staring at me

18:24.407 --> 18:26.714
with these...
these lost eyes,

18:26.757 --> 18:28.455
searching for answers.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.501
What are you
asking me, Amenadiel?

18:31.545 --> 18:35.288
I think that maybe she
deserves to know the truth.

18:35.331 --> 18:36.680
I understand that

18:36.724 --> 18:37.899
you miss your mom

18:37.942 --> 18:39.422
and that you didn'’t
get to say good-bye.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.903
But Charlotte is a woman
who has literally

18:41.946 --> 18:43.774
been to Hell and back.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.776
She'’s fragile.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.953
When I found out the truth,
it nearly broke me.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.216
And I was stable.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.392
So what are you saying?

18:52.435 --> 18:55.482
I'’m saying if you really
want to help Charlotte...

18:57.353 --> 18:59.442
...you'’ll stay away.

18:59.486 --> 19:02.532
BERGER:
Originally built in 1909,

19:02.576 --> 19:04.447
Hoffman'’s iconic
Craftsman home

19:04.491 --> 19:06.928
is just blocks away
from what I like to call

19:06.971 --> 19:08.886
"The Last Heartbreak"--

19:08.930 --> 19:10.279
the scene of the final murder,

19:10.323 --> 19:11.802
and where the killer
was ultimately

19:11.846 --> 19:14.022
apprehended by police.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.197
Why are we wasting our time

19:15.241 --> 19:16.720
with these ridiculous
shenanigans?

19:16.764 --> 19:18.505
Let'’s just grab this
miscreant and be done with it.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.028
Because, unfortunately,
we don'’t have

19:20.071 --> 19:21.638
enough evidence to arrest him.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.466
PIERCE: Serial killers love
talking about themselves.

19:23.510 --> 19:24.685
The more Neil talks,
the more likely

19:24.728 --> 19:26.165
he'’ll incriminate himself.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.210
I may as well be
speaking to myself.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.603
Uh, I'’m listening.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.561
CHLOE: Um, excuse me,
uh, Neil, is it?

19:31.605 --> 19:34.042
Yeah. Well, I was wondering
what you thought about

19:34.085 --> 19:35.696
this new copycat killer
who surfaced.

19:35.739 --> 19:38.220
Ask me, it was only a matter of
time before someone picked up

19:38.264 --> 19:40.353
where the original killer left
off. You know, someone special.

19:40.396 --> 19:41.876
Someone who knew there was
a need for what he did.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.879
Right. The original killer,
he was an auteur.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.097
But this new guy,
he'’s just...

19:46.141 --> 19:47.838
Sort of a cheap copy.

19:47.882 --> 19:50.232
Whoa.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.755
Hold on a second.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.409
This new guy is
not the original,

19:53.453 --> 19:55.237
okay, but he is
a damn sweet cover.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.108
He is efficient,
he is precise.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.849
I mean, he gets the
little details right,

19:58.893 --> 20:00.938
down to the
interlocking fingers.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.984
Detective Decker, LAPD.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.031
That information wasn'’t
public yet, was it?

20:07.075 --> 20:08.555
No, it wasn'’t.

20:08.598 --> 20:11.253
Finally, this bloody
charade is over,

20:11.297 --> 20:12.907
and things can all
go back to normal.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.391
I'’ll meet you
back at the precinct.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.785
[handcuffs clicking]Ow.

20:30.011 --> 20:33.319
WOMAN [voice echoing]:
You'’re burning my table.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.629
Can I help you?

20:39.673 --> 20:41.022
Kay?

20:46.157 --> 20:50.249
Kay. Kay, how is this possible?

20:50.292 --> 20:51.989
Is this a prank?

20:52.033 --> 20:53.469
Did someone put you up to this?

20:53.513 --> 20:54.905
Look, I get it.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.124
I look just like
my grandmother,

20:56.167 --> 20:57.473
but this is taking things
too far.

20:57.517 --> 20:58.866
[chuckles]

20:58.909 --> 21:00.737
Your grandmother,
of course.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.262
I'’m sorry, I knew her
back in the day.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.915
The resemblance is
incredible.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.656
You knew her back in the day?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.049
How old were you, like, two?

21:08.092 --> 21:09.877
I'’m older than I look.

21:09.920 --> 21:14.577
Well, Mr. Older Than
You Look, I'’m Maddie.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.100
Hi. Pierce.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.712
I used to come in here a lot,

21:18.755 --> 21:19.930
back when I was just
a detective.

21:19.974 --> 21:21.454
That'’s what we do here--

21:21.497 --> 21:23.847
cheap drinks,
good cooking and cops.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.459
That'’s actually how
my grandparents met.

21:26.502 --> 21:27.721
Gramps was a cop,

21:27.764 --> 21:29.418
and he met Nana when
she was waiting tables.

21:29.462 --> 21:32.247
"Raids" White is
your grandfather?
Yep.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.640
Cops are always
coming in here

21:33.683 --> 21:34.858
and geeking out over him.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.512
Well, yeah.
Kay married the cop

21:36.556 --> 21:38.340
who solved the Broken
Hearts Killer case.

21:38.384 --> 21:41.038
Well, he made the arrest,
but he never really solved it.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.736
He caught the guy red-handed,

21:42.779 --> 21:44.346
staging bodies
in the Chavez Ravine.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.914
True, but he never revealed how
he chose his victims.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.395
It drove Gramps crazy,
so he kept at it

21:49.438 --> 21:50.526
even after he retired.

21:50.570 --> 21:53.399
He would sit in that
booth right there

21:53.442 --> 21:56.402
with his old files
when Nana worked.
[chuckles]

21:56.445 --> 21:58.360
Where is Ray these days?

21:58.404 --> 22:00.971
Forest Lawn Cemetery.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.932
Uh, Gramps passed about
six years ago.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.977
[sighs]
And her?

22:07.021 --> 22:09.806
MADDIE:
Followed a little after.

22:11.112 --> 22:13.332
[sighs] I'’m sorry.Don'’t be.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.986
They lived a long,
happy life together,

22:16.030 --> 22:18.511
and went peacefully,
a few months apart.

22:18.554 --> 22:21.209
That sounds nice.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.651
All right, case
closed, I assume.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.914
And not a particularly
interesting one, in retrospect.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.743
Let'’s find something that's
more challenging, you know?

22:33.787 --> 22:35.919
More "us."

22:35.963 --> 22:38.139
This case isn'’t over. We have to
get a confession out of Neil.

22:38.182 --> 22:41.272
Oh, so you and Pierce can do
your dynamic duo thing again?

22:41.316 --> 22:43.797
No. It'’s you and me this time,
no Pierce.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.104
Oh. No Pierce, but we'’re still
following his lead in absentia.

22:47.148 --> 22:48.628
We are following the case.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.325
Let'’s go solve this.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.416
So Neil, from your tour,

22:54.460 --> 22:56.549
I saw that you like
to tell a good story,

22:56.592 --> 23:00.379
so tell me one now:
how'’d you do it?

23:00.422 --> 23:01.467
Yeah.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.817
Uh, well, it was early.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.036
And, uh, we met at a bar.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.299
And then, I, uh,
I gave him a sign.

23:08.343 --> 23:11.607
And he came over, at which
point, I think I said, "Hey,"

23:11.651 --> 23:13.479
and then, he was all like...

23:13.522 --> 23:15.306
"Hey," and then...Right. Can you
fast-forward

23:15.350 --> 23:17.831
to the part where you smashed
the couples'’ chests in?

23:17.874 --> 23:19.963
Wait a minute.

23:20.007 --> 23:22.270
You-you think I'’m the copycat?

23:22.313 --> 23:24.446
You fit the killer'’s
psychological profile to a T,

23:24.490 --> 23:27.841
you know things about the case
that no one else could know.

23:27.884 --> 23:29.233
Oh, my God.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.366
This is gonna be
so amazing for the tour.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.673
Now I'’m actually part
of the investigation.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.544
Oh, geez, I owe McMillan now.

23:35.588 --> 23:36.850
Mc... McMillan?

23:36.893 --> 23:38.721
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Officer McMillan over in Vice.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.027
He'’s helped me out
throughout the years.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.202
You know, he would
slip me, uh,

23:41.245 --> 23:42.682
copies of stuff
for the tour.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.161
And then, when these new
killings started happening,

23:44.205 --> 23:45.598
well, I bought
some photos off of him,

23:45.641 --> 23:47.382
and it was the best 400 bucks
I'’ve ever spent.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.516
Ha! So Pierce doesn'’t know
everything, after all.

23:54.128 --> 23:55.999
Thank you.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.310
Hey, Dan.

24:02.353 --> 24:03.833
If you'’re looking
for Twisted Ferret,

24:03.877 --> 24:05.444
they'’ve got a gig
in Bakersfield.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.532
[chuckles softly]

24:06.575 --> 24:08.490
They'’ll be back.

24:08.534 --> 24:12.755
Because this gig is still
the best gig in town.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.017
The school called.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.497
Apparently,
Trixie gave pot brownies

24:15.541 --> 24:17.717
to Ms. Benson
for Teacher Appreciation Day.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.893
Well, did she appreciate them?

24:19.936 --> 24:21.808
No, she didn'’t, Maze.

24:21.851 --> 24:24.811
She didn'’t appreciate being
rushed to the hospital

24:24.854 --> 24:26.552
when she couldn'’t feel
her legs anymore.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.379
[laughs]

24:28.423 --> 24:30.164
The woman'’s 70 years old.
What the hell were you thinking?

24:30.207 --> 24:34.081
Hey, not my fault the old hag
can'’t handle the good stuff.

24:34.124 --> 24:35.909
It'’s not a joke, Maze!

24:35.952 --> 24:37.693
Our one red line
is our daughter,

24:37.737 --> 24:39.826
and things like this
cannot happen.

24:39.869 --> 24:42.872
Or what, Douche?

24:42.916 --> 24:44.526
[exhales]

24:44.570 --> 24:47.703
If you want to live in
the same home as my kid,

24:47.747 --> 24:52.447
you can'’t keep pulling
stunts like this.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.883
Fine.

24:53.927 --> 24:55.406
I'’ll move out.

24:55.450 --> 24:56.582
Since none of you
want me here anyway.

24:56.625 --> 24:57.974
That'’s not what I'm saying.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.541
No.

24:59.585 --> 25:03.327
No, you would all love me
to be something I'’m not.

25:03.371 --> 25:06.069
Well, I am not a babysitter.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.636
I am not a roommate.

25:07.680 --> 25:11.118
And I am sick of your
Goody Two-shoes ex-wife,

25:11.161 --> 25:14.077
and that stupid little brat
of yours anyway.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.253
[quietly]:
Maze.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.740
Classy.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.482
PIERCE:
So Neil isn'’t our killer.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.267
No, he'’s just an obsessed
tour guide

25:30.311 --> 25:32.661
who legally obtained
crime scene photos.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.968
So we don'’t have any suspects.CHLOE: Yeah, and our killer

25:35.011 --> 25:36.099
could be trying
to find his next victim.

25:36.143 --> 25:37.448
We need a lead.

25:37.492 --> 25:38.972
Hold on.

25:39.015 --> 25:42.236
You said your grandfather kept
copies of all his files.

25:42.279 --> 25:43.454
Do you still have them?

25:43.498 --> 25:44.978
Somewhere in the back, yeah.

25:45.021 --> 25:46.806
My mom didn'’t have the heart
to throw them out.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.155
You mind if I take a look?

25:48.198 --> 25:49.809
Sure.

25:49.852 --> 25:53.203
Chloe, meet me at The Adams.

25:53.247 --> 25:54.683
I may have something.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.163
Yeah. I'’m on my way.

25:56.206 --> 25:58.034
LUCIFER: Ah. I
know that look.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.993
Either there are new sandwiches
in the vending machine,

26:00.036 --> 26:01.124
or you have a lead.

26:01.168 --> 26:02.822
Actually, Pierce has a lead.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.563
Oh, for goodness'’ sake.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.955
He wants us to meet him.Why?

26:05.999 --> 26:07.348
So we can watch him pontificate

26:07.391 --> 26:08.958
while leading us down
another blind alley?

26:09.002 --> 26:11.004
What is your problem today?

26:11.047 --> 26:14.137
My problem, Detective, is that
we don'’t need a third party

26:14.181 --> 26:15.617
interfering with
our partnership.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.010
You know what?
Maybe it'’s best

26:17.053 --> 26:18.489
if I meet Pierce alone.

26:18.533 --> 26:20.535
We don'’t have time
to make this about you.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.668
There is a serial killer
on the loose.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.670
Uh... Detective.

26:31.372 --> 26:32.852
KAY: To wrapping up
your latest case.

26:32.895 --> 26:34.549
Sayonara, Broken Hearts Killer.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.029
Well, Ray was actually
the one to catch him,

26:36.072 --> 26:38.553
but I'’m happy
to drink to that anyway.

26:41.077 --> 26:43.253
[sighs]

26:43.297 --> 26:46.648
Now, maybe you can take me
on a real date,

26:46.692 --> 26:49.172
instead of just pie
and drinks here.

26:51.305 --> 26:54.569
[sighs, clears throat]

26:54.613 --> 26:58.007
Let me guess,
you already have your next case.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.487
No, not this time.

26:59.530 --> 27:02.838
Um...

27:02.882 --> 27:04.840
I'’m transferring.

27:04.884 --> 27:05.972
Out of state.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.756
Transferring?

27:07.800 --> 27:08.844
Why?

27:08.888 --> 27:12.108
It'’s just... time.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.762
I don'’t understand.

27:13.806 --> 27:16.112
This is what I do. I move
forward and I never look back.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.462
But I thought we...
you and I were...

27:18.506 --> 27:20.073
I deal with death
every day,

27:20.116 --> 27:22.118
and someday, you'’re gonna die,
too, and I just...

27:22.162 --> 27:23.685
You have these
walls up,

27:23.729 --> 27:26.862
and I thought it was part
of your whole tough guy act,

27:26.906 --> 27:31.650
but now I see what it is:
you'’re scared.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.000
But you know what
the sad truth is?

27:34.043 --> 27:35.828
If you don'’t
learn to open up,

27:35.871 --> 27:39.440
nobody will ever love you.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.226
I know.

27:43.270 --> 27:44.793
CHLOE:
Pierce, look at this.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.667
Hey.

27:48.710 --> 27:49.972
Pierce.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.147
Are you okay?

27:51.191 --> 27:52.540
Yeah, sorry. Um...

27:52.583 --> 27:54.020
[clears throat]
What were you saying?

27:54.063 --> 27:55.499
Your mentor,

27:55.543 --> 27:57.937
look at all this stuff
that he found, like,

27:57.980 --> 27:59.503
look-- these call logs.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.723
They prove that the
original killer'’s victims

28:01.767 --> 28:04.813
all had spouses that called
into the Dear Dottieradio show.

28:04.857 --> 28:08.121
That was a radio show about
love and relationship advice.

28:08.164 --> 28:09.426
Yeah.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.732
Yeah. You really know
your history.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.734
[chuckles softly]A-Anyway,

28:12.778 --> 28:15.345
it'’s the only connection that
was found between the victims.

28:15.389 --> 28:16.825
But that show went off the air
years ago.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.697
I'’m not sure
how it'’s gonna help us now.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.351
Well, if the original killer
listened to the radio show

28:21.395 --> 28:22.657
to find his victims, then maybe

28:22.701 --> 28:24.354
the copycat'’s doing
the same thing.

28:24.398 --> 28:27.053
So the question is what
radio show would that be now?

28:27.096 --> 28:28.750
Oh, my God. Chance'’s Chocolates?

28:28.794 --> 28:30.186
I'’m obsessed.

28:30.230 --> 28:33.450
It'’s a radio show that sets up
cheating couples.

28:33.494 --> 28:35.409
See, Chance brings
someone on who thinks

28:35.452 --> 28:37.367
their spouse is
cheating, and then,

28:37.411 --> 28:40.631
he calls the cheater pretending
to be a candy shop

28:40.675 --> 28:42.503
giving away free chocolates
as a promotion,

28:42.546 --> 28:44.505
and asks
who they should send it to.

28:44.548 --> 28:46.507
How thrilling.
Huh.Right?

28:46.550 --> 28:48.552
And then, the person
either names their partner

28:48.596 --> 28:52.426
and "Aw, happy ending,"
or... they name someone else,

28:52.469 --> 28:54.210
and expose
their dirty,

28:54.254 --> 28:55.211
cheating ways.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.343
Oh, it'’s so juicy.

28:56.386 --> 28:58.345
So it turns out, both couples

28:58.388 --> 28:59.781
had a significant other
that appeared on the show.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.522
LUCIFER: So
we'’re assuming

29:01.565 --> 29:04.046
that our killer listens
to this juvenile program?

29:04.090 --> 29:05.787
We'’ve narrowed
our suspects down to anyone

29:05.831 --> 29:08.398
who doesn'’t have
satellite radio, and Ms. Lopez.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.400
Actually, the addresses
are beeped out.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.751
Probably for reasons like this.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.405
Okay, so the killer has to be
somebody that works on the show.

29:15.449 --> 29:16.842
Someone with access
to this info?

29:16.885 --> 29:19.975
Right. So we need to make
ourselves the target,

29:20.019 --> 29:21.411
and flush the killer out.

29:21.455 --> 29:22.891
Great idea.
Decker and I will do it.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.197
We'’ll give out
my home address

29:24.240 --> 29:25.198
and lure the killer there.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.590
Sure.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.897
That could work.
ELLA:
Oh, man.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.638
You guys are totally gonna be
the cheating lovers.

29:30.681 --> 29:33.075
Marvelous. Well,
since that'’s been sorted,

29:33.119 --> 29:35.338
I assume my services
are no longer needed.

29:35.382 --> 29:36.600
Uh, actually,

29:36.644 --> 29:38.428
there is one
more piece

29:38.472 --> 29:39.908
of the sting we'’ll need.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.606
CHANCE: And we are here
with our jilted lover, Lucifer.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.043
[laughing]:
Now, first off,

29:44.086 --> 29:46.219
what is up with that name?
"Lucifer"? I-I...

29:46.262 --> 29:47.829
You think maybe

29:47.873 --> 29:49.613
that is part of the reason
that'’s driving a wedge

29:49.657 --> 29:50.919
between you and your old lady?

29:50.963 --> 29:53.661
Well, first off,
I am not a "jilted lover."

29:53.704 --> 29:56.142
No, no. No one ever wants
to believe that, do they?

29:56.185 --> 29:58.448
But you wouldn'’t be here
if you probably didn'’t think

29:58.492 --> 29:59.928
something was going on, right?

29:59.972 --> 30:02.278
And we'’re gonna find out
exactly what that is

30:02.322 --> 30:03.714
when we come back.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.064
[clears throat, sniffles]

30:05.107 --> 30:06.282
You'’re doing great, by the way.

30:06.326 --> 30:07.936
You'’re late!

30:07.980 --> 30:10.330
BRANDON: Yeah, sorry I'’m late.
Traffic was just awful.

30:11.418 --> 30:12.506
Stop.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.595
I ordered a pastrami.

30:14.638 --> 30:17.293
Is this pastrami?
No, it is not pastrami!

30:17.337 --> 30:18.817
Now get out of here!

30:18.860 --> 30:21.645
And we are back
with our guest Lucifer,

30:21.689 --> 30:24.648
who is now gonna tell us
all about his girl Chloe.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.828
Uh, right. Well, um,
she'’s my partner.

30:29.871 --> 30:30.959
At work.

30:31.003 --> 30:32.656
Oh, so it'’s
a workplace thing, huh?

30:32.700 --> 30:34.441
When did things change?

30:34.484 --> 30:38.662
Well, she'’s been spending quite
a bit of time with our new boss.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.360
Cheating on you with the boss?

30:40.403 --> 30:41.622
Oh, that'’s low.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.189
Well, it'’s quite
a bit more complex

30:43.232 --> 30:45.234
than your obnoxious braying'’s
making it out to be.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.714
Well, let'’s find out, shall we?

30:46.757 --> 30:48.368
Let'’s get Chloe on the line.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.805
Uh, yes?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.285
CHANCE [Swiss accent]:
Uh, hello, uh, Chloe?

30:52.328 --> 30:54.678
Uh, this is, uh, Pop Sugar.

30:54.722 --> 30:57.507
We are a new Swiss chocolate
shop in Los Feliz,

30:57.551 --> 30:59.770
and we are, uh,
running a big promotion.

30:59.814 --> 31:02.469
Yeah, we are going to send, uh,
a free box of chocolates

31:02.512 --> 31:04.775
to, uh, your special someone,

31:04.819 --> 31:06.647
if you have
a special someone somewhere?

31:06.690 --> 31:08.388
CHLOE:
Oh, wow.

31:08.431 --> 31:09.824
Wow, yeah, that'’s awesome. Um...

31:09.868 --> 31:12.044
and-and actually,
it'’s perfect timing.

31:12.087 --> 31:14.481
Um, as we'’re having, um,
a date night tonight.

31:14.524 --> 31:15.830
Oh! Wonderful.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.919
All we need, then,
is his name and address.

31:17.963 --> 31:20.617
Yeah, his name is Marcus,
and he lives at...

31:20.661 --> 31:23.229
[old-fashioned car horn
sound effect brays]

31:23.272 --> 31:25.144
Okay, Chloe, that is good.

31:25.187 --> 31:26.623
Listen, I'’m just curious,

31:26.667 --> 31:29.278
because we'’re all
such romantics here,

31:29.322 --> 31:31.802
what is it about, uh,
t-this, uh, guy

31:31.846 --> 31:33.979
that gives you the goose bumps?

31:34.022 --> 31:37.069
Uh...

31:37.112 --> 31:38.418
um...

31:38.461 --> 31:40.942
well, he'’s, um...

31:40.986 --> 31:43.423
he'’s...

31:43.466 --> 31:45.077
he'’s very handsome.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.949
Yeah, but isn'’t there anything,
uh, more than just looks?

31:47.993 --> 31:50.604
Um, well, he'’s very brave,

31:50.647 --> 31:54.260
and we both care
about the same sorts of things,

31:54.303 --> 31:56.653
like, well, doing what'’s right,

31:56.697 --> 31:58.960
and, uh,
and helping other people.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.267
I think he'’s a good person.

32:01.310 --> 32:02.790
Sounds like
a hell of a guy.

32:02.833 --> 32:05.271
Uh, and we'’ll make sure
to get that package to him

32:05.314 --> 32:08.274
uh, before the end of the night.

32:08.317 --> 32:10.232
Okay, thanks.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.669
[normal voice]:
And there you have it, everyone.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.889
Another cheater exposed.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.586
[chuckles] Sometimes,
chocolate can be dark,

32:16.630 --> 32:18.066
but you know what?

32:18.110 --> 32:20.286
Isn'’t better to always know
the... truth?

32:20.329 --> 32:22.636
Where the hell did he go?

32:28.859 --> 32:31.210
Welcome to my humble abode.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.646
Um...

32:32.689 --> 32:33.908
I like rocks.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.824
You have a
rock collection?

32:36.867 --> 32:38.347
Well, the thing about rocks
is they'’re old.

32:38.391 --> 32:40.306
They never change.

32:40.349 --> 32:43.222
I'’ve taken one from all
the places I'’ve visited.

32:43.265 --> 32:46.703
You'’ve been a lot
of places, huh?

32:46.747 --> 32:49.663
Well, gather no moss
and all that.

32:49.706 --> 32:51.665
I know I don'’t have
a lot of things,

32:51.708 --> 32:55.495
but what I love about this place
is the killer view.

32:55.538 --> 32:59.107
Oh, my God.

32:59.151 --> 33:01.022
This is beautiful.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.155
[Pierce chuckles]

33:03.198 --> 33:04.504
Decker, listen.

33:04.547 --> 33:07.115
I know that our, uh,
opportunity for a second date

33:07.159 --> 33:08.377
was interrupted earlier.

33:08.421 --> 33:10.510
Hopefully this will
make up for it.

33:10.553 --> 33:12.729
DAN:
Hey, you guys all set?

33:12.773 --> 33:15.080
[clears throat]

33:15.123 --> 33:17.386
Hey, Dan. Yeah.
We'’re all set here.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.040
Coast is clear on my end.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.957
Ah, excellent. Daniel.
You'’re here.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.133
Hey, pal. I didn'’t know you
were coming in for this one.

33:25.177 --> 33:29.094
I wasn'’t, but, um, I wanted
to ask you something.

33:29.137 --> 33:30.530
Okay.

33:30.573 --> 33:33.054
How did you move on
from the detective

33:33.098 --> 33:34.621
when I showed up
and replaced you?

33:34.664 --> 33:37.319
And please,
don'’t say improv.

33:37.363 --> 33:39.713
You didn'’t replace me.Well, true, true.

33:39.756 --> 33:41.062
I suppose that would imply
we'’re on the same level.

33:41.106 --> 33:44.500
[sighs] Look, I get
it. All right?

33:44.544 --> 33:46.546
I get how you feel with this
whole Pierce and Chloe thing.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.374
Mm.
And, yes,

33:48.417 --> 33:51.768
I admit, I did feel a little
jealous when you showed up.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.335
Well, justifiably so.

33:53.379 --> 33:56.338
[sighs] But then I realized
you had nothing to do

33:56.382 --> 33:57.557
with why my marriage ended.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.080
You and I are
different people.

33:59.124 --> 34:01.126
We each have our own
relationship with Chloe.

34:01.169 --> 34:03.258
Once I came to terms
with that, I was fine.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.089
I hope you don'’t mind.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.961
I asked Lopez what
your favorite dish was.

34:11.005 --> 34:14.922
No, it'’s, um, it's great.

34:14.965 --> 34:18.273
Is something wrong?

34:18.317 --> 34:19.796
Um...

34:19.840 --> 34:23.365
um, Marcus, maybe we
shouldn'’t do this.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.280
Are we too visible?

34:25.324 --> 34:27.065
No.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.892
Is the plan too obvious?No, no, no.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.459
I mean you and me.

34:30.503 --> 34:32.592
You know, we work together
and things could get weird.

34:32.635 --> 34:33.941
That'’s all.

34:33.984 --> 34:36.161
Look, you asked me
out first, Decker.

34:38.250 --> 34:41.253
I, uh... I did

34:41.296 --> 34:42.993
and you turned me down.

34:43.037 --> 34:47.433
And I... I was disappointed,
but, you know, I got it.

34:47.476 --> 34:50.262
And you'’re the one who said
you'’re, you know,

34:50.305 --> 34:51.785
"not relationship material."

34:53.134 --> 34:57.486
You'’re a good man
and I really like you,

34:57.530 --> 35:02.143
but I, uh, I-I need somebody
who can let me in

35:02.187 --> 35:05.929
and I just don'’t know
if that'’s... you.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.593
Hello, shadowy figure.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.856
Here to spoil the date?

35:21.597 --> 35:22.859
[grunting]

35:23.817 --> 35:25.123
God! God!

35:25.166 --> 35:27.690
LAPD. You'’re under arrest.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.344
I know my rights, okay?

35:29.388 --> 35:32.173
Fair use, I want a lawyer.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.001
Pastrami boy?
[chuckles]

35:34.044 --> 35:36.438
You'’re the killer?Killer? What?

35:36.482 --> 35:38.179
What are you talking about?
