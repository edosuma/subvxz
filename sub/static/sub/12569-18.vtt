WEBVTT

00:02.378 --> 00:04.172
And when I earned my final,

00:04.173 --> 00:05.965
record-breaking

00:02.378 --> 00:05.965
Butterfly Badge,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.800
- my mom had
- my sash be-diamonded!

00:10.135 --> 00:11.992
If she doesn't stop bragging,

00:11.993 --> 00:13.848
I'm gonna bury her

00:10.135 --> 00:13.848
in that sash.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.873
Hey, little Caterpillars,

00:17.874 --> 00:19.562
who wants some

00:16.183 --> 00:19.562
cocoon juice?

00:19.604 --> 00:20.897
ALL: Ew!

00:20.939 --> 00:21.940
It's fruit punch.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.443
Jessie,

00:25.444 --> 00:26.652
what are you wearing?

00:26.694 --> 00:28.780
My Armadillo scout uniform.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.240
You say that like

00:30.241 --> 00:31.657
it's not embarrassing.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.327
Hey, an armadillo can survive

00:33.328 --> 00:34.953
scorching hot temperatures,

00:34.994 --> 00:36.705
and bravely dodge

00:36.706 --> 00:38.414
eighteen-wheelers

00:34.994 --> 00:38.414
on the highway.

00:38.456 --> 00:39.850
- Which, now that
- I think about it,

00:39.874 --> 00:41.585
Was probably not the best

00:41.586 --> 00:43.294
place to sell cookies.

00:43.335 --> 00:45.609
So, for old time's sake,

00:45.610 --> 00:47.882
you just decided to dress up

00:43.335 --> 00:47.882
like roadkill?

00:47.924 --> 00:50.239
No, Zuri has had

00:50.240 --> 00:52.553
a little difficulty

00:47.924 --> 00:52.553
earning her badges.

00:52.595 --> 00:54.264
I even panicked

00:54.265 --> 00:55.932
trying to earn

00:52.595 --> 00:55.932
the Shoe-Tying Badge.

00:55.974 --> 00:57.309
Which way does

00:57.310 --> 00:58.643
the stinking rabbit go?

01:00.019 --> 01:01.854
- So, I'm gonna
- offer to help.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.357
I'm sure your

01:03.358 --> 01:04.816
troop leader will be

01:01.896 --> 01:04.816
thrilled to have me.

01:04.857 --> 01:05.942
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

01:05.943 --> 01:07.026

01:07.986 --> 01:09.821
You? I hate you.

01:10.905 --> 01:11.948
Coach Penny?

01:11.990 --> 01:13.783
- That's Troop Leader
- Penny, to you!

01:13.825 --> 01:15.761
- Still writing songs about
- your perfect boyfriend,

01:15.785 --> 01:17.703
- Making us single
- gals feel bad?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.825
- Yes, but I'm guessing
- you don't want to hear one.

01:20.832 --> 01:21.937
All right, Caterpillars,

01:21.938 --> 01:23.042
antennae up!

01:23.083 --> 01:24.106
Let's get this

01:24.107 --> 01:25.127
meeting started.

01:25.169 --> 01:26.963
Yes, sir! Hoo-ah!

01:28.464 --> 01:30.424
- She calls
- her mom sir?

01:30.466 --> 01:32.384
Wouldn't you?

01:32.426 --> 01:33.573
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

01:33.574 --> 01:34.720
Quiet!

01:34.762 --> 01:36.535
Ooh! I notice we have

01:36.536 --> 01:38.307
a highly decorated

01:34.762 --> 01:38.307
veteran here.

01:43.521 --> 01:44.981
Emma Ross,

01:44.982 --> 01:46.440
Monarch first class.

01:46.482 --> 01:47.942
The Emma Ross?

01:47.984 --> 01:49.819
- All-time top
- Butterfly Badge-earner?

01:49.861 --> 01:51.946
And uniform catalog model.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.202
Zuri, you had Emma Ross

01:57.203 --> 01:58.536
as an example,

01:58.577 --> 01:59.662
and you still haven't even

01:59.663 --> 02:00.746
learned the Butterfly

01:58.577 --> 02:00.746
handshake?

02:00.788 --> 02:01.935
Butterflies

02:01.936 --> 02:03.082
don't have hands!

02:03.123 --> 02:04.834
- The whole thing
- is insane!

02:05.960 --> 02:08.670
Who's with me?

02:08.713 --> 02:10.318
Anyway, this weekend's

02:10.320 --> 02:11.924
camping trip is

02:08.713 --> 02:11.924
the last chance

02:11.966 --> 02:13.843
- for some of our
- slower Caterpillars,

02:13.885 --> 02:15.387
And you know

02:15.388 --> 02:16.888
who you are,

02:16.929 --> 02:18.035
to get a badge,

02:18.036 --> 02:19.139
and move up to Butterfly.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.621
I have all my badges,

02:20.622 --> 02:22.060
Mommy.

02:22.894 --> 02:24.103
I mean, sir!

02:25.730 --> 02:26.856
Including the

02:26.857 --> 02:27.982
Braggy Pants Badge.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.526
- (BLOWING WHISTLE)
- Quiet!

02:30.568 --> 02:32.486
- Talking during
- the meeting is distracting.

02:32.528 --> 02:33.592
And so is that

02:33.593 --> 02:34.655
ridiculous uniform.

02:34.697 --> 02:35.970
Says the woman with

02:35.971 --> 02:37.241
a bug on her head.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.201
Back in Texas, there's

02:39.202 --> 02:41.120
no greater honor than

02:37.282 --> 02:41.120
being an Armadillo scout!

02:42.955 --> 02:44.103
Well, that may count in

02:44.104 --> 02:45.249
a fly-over state,

02:45.290 --> 02:47.292
but here in the big city

02:47.293 --> 02:49.294
that doesn't mean

02:45.290 --> 02:49.294
arma-diddly!

02:49.336 --> 02:50.981
- You'll see what Armadillo
- scouts are made of,

02:51.005 --> 02:52.858
- Because I'm going - on that camping trip
- With Zuri,

02:52.882 --> 02:54.466
- And helping
- her earn a badge!

02:54.508 --> 02:56.093
Well, fine by me.

02:56.094 --> 02:57.678
I could use a good laugh.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.513
- You could also
- use some floss.

05:01.011 --> 05:02.344
tell me the truth.

See? When done correctly,

lying is sort of like

05:24.075 --> 05:27.870

Ooh, perhaps I could

05:29.165 --> 05:30.414
make a costume...

- With a cape,
- and boots...

05:32.208 --> 05:33.458
Don't cheapen this.

Now, you put up

the cross-poles,

05:38.047 --> 05:41.133
set up the support braces,

line up the grommets,

- do it for you

- and stay out of my way.

- about you Armadillos,

06:36.795 --> 06:37.815
do their own work.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.650
- (GASPS)
- So do Armadillos!

06:39.691 --> 06:42.174
And, we can jump

Oh, she'll earn a badge.

07:23.819 --> 07:26.239
because one of the judges

07:26.240 --> 07:28.657
discovered a cricket

07:23.819 --> 07:28.657
in my lobster bisque!

- Luke, I know
- you did this!

No! I assure you,

07:32.266 --> 07:34.496
Luke is not

07:37.272 --> 07:38.292
it was you?

07:38.334 --> 07:39.981
Uh, um...

07:39.982 --> 07:41.628
Uh, of course not.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.277
It was a man

07:43.278 --> 07:44.882
in a butler's uniform!

07:44.923 --> 07:46.717
We saw him sneaking out!

07:46.758 --> 07:47.948
Really?

07:47.949 --> 07:49.136
What did he look like?

07:50.221 --> 07:52.306
Keep it simple.

- I did?
- He did?

Nigel's always been

08:13.537 --> 08:14.828
jealous of my cooking.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.289
He clearly did this

08:16.290 --> 08:17.706

08:14.870 --> 08:17.706
out of the contest!

08:17.748 --> 08:19.104

than spit in it.
