00:22.990 --> 00:25.469
Hello! And welcome
to Top Gear.

00:25.470 --> 00:28.949
Tonight, we're all
about one place - Japan.

00:28.950 --> 00:31.509
A country that has brought us some
of the coolest,

00:31.510 --> 00:33.349
fastest cars of them all.

00:33.350 --> 00:36.269
But in recent years, Japan's
suffered a sort of

00:36.270 --> 00:38.789
reverse mid-life crisis.

00:38.790 --> 00:44.069
It's stopped being crazy and fun and
got all boring and Prius-y.

00:44.070 --> 00:47.989
But now there's a couple of signs
Japan might just be getting its mojo

00:47.990 --> 00:51.110
back, so Chris went to investigate.

01:04.430 --> 01:08.510
First up is a new two-door
rear-wheel drive coupe from Lexus.

01:10.110 --> 01:12.709
It's called the LC500,

01:12.710 --> 01:15.470
and while it might look as sharp as
a samurai sword...

01:17.710 --> 01:21.150
..this version is powered by
an appealingly blunt instrument.

01:31.150 --> 01:32.830
Woo-hoo-hoo!

01:34.030 --> 01:35.870
Have some of that!

01:39.550 --> 01:44.510
Seriously, who needs a stereo when
you've got a soundtrack like that?

01:46.750 --> 01:51.070
This retro anthem isn't being played
by a clever, futuristic hybrid.

01:52.190 --> 01:57.150
Underneath the bonnet is a proper,
old school, electric-free V8.

02:03.830 --> 02:07.229
O to 60, less than five seconds,

02:07.230 --> 02:10.190
top speed, nearly 170mph.

02:14.430 --> 02:19.669
We keep being told the fuel-gargling
petrol engine is dead,

02:19.670 --> 02:23.989
but if responsible, conscientious
Lexus still thinks it has legs,

02:23.990 --> 02:26.310
we might be good
for a few years yet.

02:30.310 --> 02:34.589
Especially when that engine is kept
in check by four-wheel steering,

02:34.590 --> 02:38.470
and has been bolted to the stiffest
chassis Lexus has ever produced.

02:40.070 --> 02:43.430
So when you get to a corner, yeah,
it can handle those, too.

02:49.910 --> 02:52.669
It turns nicely, grip builds,

02:52.670 --> 02:55.910
good traction, but it's rear-wheel
drive, so it's playful.

02:57.110 --> 03:00.029
That engine's power and torque is
perfectly matched to the amount of

03:00.030 --> 03:03.229
grip available, so I'm getting those
lovely, little delicate slides

03:03.230 --> 03:04.909
in the exit of the corners.

03:04.910 --> 03:07.470
It encourages you to behave like a
bit of a wally.

03:14.230 --> 03:16.550
It's so un-Lexus, it's wonderful!

03:20.830 --> 03:24.549
But it is a Lexus,
so it's not all good news.

03:24.550 --> 03:28.589
It starts at Â£76,000,
which is too much.

03:28.590 --> 03:30.469
It weighs nearly two tonnes,

03:30.470 --> 03:32.829
so on a track it doesn't stop
very well,

03:32.830 --> 03:35.710
and it is a bit... overcomplicated.

03:36.830 --> 03:39.029
Four, five, six, seven...

03:39.030 --> 03:40.629
Ten gears?!

03:40.630 --> 03:43.629
Now I'm all for getting more for
your money, but if you have to

03:43.630 --> 03:46.149
deploy long division to work out
what gear you're in,

03:46.150 --> 03:47.750
that might be overkill.

03:49.070 --> 03:51.510
But while the LC500 isn't perfect...

03:53.270 --> 03:55.629
..I do admire it.

03:55.630 --> 03:58.230
It stands out from the crowd.

04:00.910 --> 04:04.829
It's not trying to be a Porsche, or
a Jaguar, or a BMW

04:04.830 --> 04:07.070
or any other European coupe.

04:08.110 --> 04:10.869
It's Japan doing its own thing,

04:10.870 --> 04:13.230
and it's not the only one.

04:15.110 --> 04:16.869
Because...

04:16.870 --> 04:18.829
..there's also this.

04:20.070 --> 04:22.389
The new Civic Type R.

04:22.390 --> 04:25.990
Honda's not-so-subtle antidote to
all of Europe's very fast...

04:28.430 --> 04:30.510
..very samey hot hatches.

04:34.430 --> 04:36.829
But the question is,

04:36.830 --> 04:40.710
does it have the trousers
to back up the mouth?

04:43.590 --> 04:45.669
Oh, yes, it does!

04:45.670 --> 04:47.470
Yes, yes, yes!

04:52.110 --> 04:54.669
This is a cracker of a hot hatch.

04:54.670 --> 04:59.909
It's got a two litre turbo-charged
motor, 316 horsepower,

04:59.910 --> 05:02.909
and it weighs just under 1,400 kg.

05:02.910 --> 05:04.350
That is potent.

05:06.190 --> 05:08.990
Hitting 60 in 5.8 seconds,

05:10.630 --> 05:14.230
and with a top speed of 169mph,

05:16.550 --> 05:19.830
this will give any hot hatch
a run for its money.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.509
I just love it!

05:26.510 --> 05:29.229
And it's got a proper manual
gearbox.

05:29.230 --> 05:33.749
Look at this stick down here with a
perfect Type R aluminium gear knob,

05:33.750 --> 05:36.070
and it has a sensible number of
gears, too.

05:37.030 --> 05:40.269
And while more and more hot hatches
now turn up with sensible,

05:40.270 --> 05:42.269
grippy four-wheel drive,

05:42.270 --> 05:45.390
the Civic still sends all of its
power to the front.

05:47.350 --> 05:49.589
And it's all the better for it.

05:49.590 --> 05:53.189
It's so much more fun than
a four-wheel drive hot hatch,

05:53.190 --> 05:55.789
because it's got grip
when you want it,

05:55.790 --> 05:58.269
but when you don't, it'll do this.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.670
â™ª One, two, three, four,
five, break down. â™ª

06:07.750 --> 06:10.150
You get in it,
and you grow horns.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.670
Woohoohoo!

06:15.270 --> 06:19.949
What we have here, then, is a car
that Japan should be truly proud of.

06:19.950 --> 06:24.109
Except, that is, for one tiny
detail.

06:24.110 --> 06:27.989
You see, the Type R's not actually
made in Japan at all.

06:27.990 --> 06:29.709
It's made in...

06:29.710 --> 06:31.549
- WHISPERS - ..Swindon.

06:31.550 --> 06:33.429
And there's nothing wrong
with Swindon -

06:33.430 --> 06:36.990
you just don't really associate it
with excitement, do you?

06:38.750 --> 06:42.429
And then, of course,
there's the way it looks.

06:42.430 --> 06:46.430
Clearly, it's been designed only to
appeal to children.

06:47.710 --> 06:49.509
But here's the issue -

06:49.510 --> 06:52.709
this thing costs over 30 grand.

06:52.710 --> 06:55.349
Â£30,000!

06:55.350 --> 06:57.829
So even if you were
young and daft enough to think it

06:57.830 --> 06:59.269
looked good enough to buy,

06:59.270 --> 07:01.669
you wouldn't be able to afford to
buy one.

07:01.670 --> 07:03.589
But look at it another way,

07:03.590 --> 07:06.590
if you're in the market for a new
Japanese performance car...

07:08.070 --> 07:11.869
..this Honda might just be a bit of
a bargain.

07:11.870 --> 07:15.349
It may have 150-something
horsepower less,

07:15.350 --> 07:19.709
but I suspect this Civic might
be about as quick around this track

07:19.710 --> 07:21.949
as that LC500.

07:21.950 --> 07:25.190
Time, then, for a race.

07:31.030 --> 07:34.709
Which means we need a driver
for that Lexus.

07:34.710 --> 07:38.430
No, it's not the Stig, it's the
Stig's ninja cousin.

07:41.350 --> 07:42.750
Where is he?

07:49.190 --> 07:51.229
Yes, most impressive.

07:51.230 --> 07:53.309
I think you're being silly now.

07:53.310 --> 07:54.469
Get in the car.

07:54.470 --> 07:55.830
Kuruma!

07:56.750 --> 07:58.830
Whoa!

08:17.190 --> 08:21.669
Player One, Lexus LC500, versus

08:21.670 --> 08:25.789
Player Two, Honda Civic Type R.

08:25.790 --> 08:28.549
One lap, winner takes all!

08:28.550 --> 08:30.230
Let's do this.

08:39.590 --> 08:41.429
He's got me off the line.

08:44.870 --> 08:47.990
Come on, Ninja Stig. Look at him,
he's sideways everywhere!

09:02.870 --> 09:05.509
I sort of want to beat him, but I
sort of don't want to beat him.

09:05.510 --> 09:07.870
What does a Ninja Stig do
if he gets beaten?

09:13.270 --> 09:15.989
Let's get up the inside of him.
Oh, he's looking lively!

09:15.990 --> 09:17.950
Now I've got to outbrake him.

09:19.510 --> 09:21.749
I've got him, I've got him,
I've got him on the brakes!

09:21.750 --> 09:23.149
I've done him!

09:23.150 --> 09:25.150
What fantastic brakes.

09:27.670 --> 09:29.670
Now he's got grunt!

09:35.710 --> 09:37.710
There he goes!

09:44.430 --> 09:46.230
He's got traction issues.

09:48.950 --> 09:51.350
This is so impressive for a
hatchback!

09:53.590 --> 09:56.189
I've got brakes, I've
got grip, I've got turning.

09:56.190 --> 09:59.229
Oh, he's running wide, he's running
wide! This is my chance, my chance!

09:59.230 --> 10:01.670
Come on, little Honda! Come on,
little Honda!

10:08.190 --> 10:10.189
Yes!

10:10.190 --> 10:13.989
Player Two, Honda Civic Type R,
wins!

10:13.990 --> 10:17.470
Well done, little Honda!

10:24.670 --> 10:27.549
So the Honda beat the Lexus?

10:27.550 --> 10:30.669
Wow! Impressive. And you really
liked the Civic, right?

10:30.670 --> 10:34.189
It's brilliant. The chassis is
fantastic, and it's SO fast.

10:34.190 --> 10:36.709
It really is the best hot hatchback
you can buy.

10:36.710 --> 10:38.429
What? Whoa, wait a minute.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.469
We said the Ford Focus RS was the
best you could buy,

10:41.470 --> 10:42.949
so I went out and bought one.

10:42.950 --> 10:44.789
Well, you'll have to buy one of
these now.

10:44.790 --> 10:46.629
No, I can't do that.

10:46.630 --> 10:49.629
I mean, look at it. It's hideous.

10:49.630 --> 10:52.869
OK, I admit it. I mean,
it's disgusting.

10:52.870 --> 10:56.069
- Yeah. - But it's so good to drive,
I can forgive the way it looks,

10:56.070 --> 10:58.189
and the best thing about being
behind the wheel -

10:58.190 --> 11:00.589
you don't see how it looks
from the outside.

11:00.590 --> 11:02.909
They should put that in the
commercial.

11:02.910 --> 11:06.149
OK, now, earlier today we put both
cars around our test track in the

11:06.150 --> 11:09.269
hands of the Stig. Not great
conditions out there,

11:09.270 --> 11:11.629
but the Lexus did it

11:11.630 --> 11:13.869
in a 1:25:6,

11:13.870 --> 11:16.509
so that goes there,

11:16.510 --> 11:18.509
and the Civic did it

11:18.510 --> 11:22.269
in a 1:25:6.

11:22.270 --> 11:25.670
The exact same time,
so that goes right there.

11:26.950 --> 11:29.029
Oh... That's great work.

11:29.030 --> 11:31.149
It goes in there.

11:31.150 --> 11:33.190
- Or down the bottom,
who gives a - BLEEP!

11:40.350 --> 11:42.309
I told you they were close.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.789
- Yep, very close. - And that time makes
the Civic

11:44.790 --> 11:47.229
the fastest front-wheel
drive car,

11:47.230 --> 11:50.789
and the fastest hot
hatchback ever around our track,

11:50.790 --> 11:53.350
- and that's got to be worth a round
of applause. - Oh, yeah.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.629
Well done, you guys. OK, come on.

11:59.630 --> 12:02.309
Let's talk about '90s Japanese
sports cars,

12:02.310 --> 12:03.989
because they were awesome.

12:03.990 --> 12:07.469
A golden era of fast, affordable
performance.

12:07.470 --> 12:11.429
Problem is, the ones that made it to
the UK have been mostly crashed or

12:11.430 --> 12:15.869
modified, and the ones that haven't
are now annoyingly expensive.

12:15.870 --> 12:18.309
That's right. Look at this lovely
Honda NSX.

12:18.310 --> 12:21.069
A couple of years ago?
30 grand.

12:21.070 --> 12:23.429
Today, 60 grand.

12:23.430 --> 12:26.749
But it turns out there is a place
you can pick up immaculate, old

12:26.750 --> 12:29.749
Japanese sports cars for a fraction
of the price.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.350
That's right. It's called Japan.

12:35.590 --> 12:38.590
We've been sent to Tokyo,

12:40.310 --> 12:44.669
where we've been told to go and find
two of Japan's finest classic

12:44.670 --> 12:46.789
'90s sports cars.

12:46.790 --> 12:49.189
Oh, how cool is this, huh?

12:49.190 --> 12:53.429
Three days in Japan, and all we have
to do is buy a couple of old cars.

12:53.430 --> 12:57.109
That leaves us plenty of time to do
cool Japanese stuff, like temples,

12:57.110 --> 12:59.389
and swords, and ninjas, and sushi.

12:59.390 --> 13:01.869
- Well, I've got a list of sights
I want to see, too. - Oh, yeah?

13:01.870 --> 13:03.509
Yeah, yeah, Toyota Century.

13:03.510 --> 13:08.549
- Uh-huh. - Honda S660, maybe even
a first-generation Estima.

13:08.550 --> 13:11.789
Yeah, OK, so hold on, these sights
you're talking about,

13:11.790 --> 13:13.269
are they all cars?

13:13.270 --> 13:16.429
Well, technically the Estima
was a minivan, but you'll see cars

13:16.430 --> 13:19.469
here you won't see anywhere else
on the planet, man.

13:19.470 --> 13:22.189
Japan's like its own weird
little car ecosystem.

13:22.190 --> 13:25.309
Yeah, look, I know this is a car
show, and I know you love cars,

13:25.310 --> 13:27.709
and you know I love cars,
but I think...

13:27.710 --> 13:31.149
- Cars are everything... - I think you
think about them way too...

13:31.150 --> 13:34.509
- Hi. - Oh, wow, a challenge already,
huh?

13:34.510 --> 13:36.629
"Here, have one million yen each."

13:36.630 --> 13:39.309
- Oh, wow, look at that.
- My kind of challenge.

13:39.310 --> 13:41.309
- OK. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you.

13:41.310 --> 13:42.549
Thank you.

13:42.550 --> 13:44.349
Thank you.

13:44.350 --> 13:46.629
OK, ready, last one, here we go.

13:46.630 --> 13:48.189
Right, I'm done. We're done.

13:48.190 --> 13:50.389
Oh, he got me on the way out.
Did you see that?

13:50.390 --> 13:51.790
Oh, oh-oh, oh...

13:52.910 --> 13:57.349
OK, "With this cash you will now
head to the USS Tokyo car auction

13:57.350 --> 14:02.189
"in Chiba Ken and each buy a sports
car to ship back to Britain
and sell."

14:02.190 --> 14:05.469
- Oh, yes! - "The presenter who clears
the most profit on their car is the

14:05.470 --> 14:08.909
"winner. Oh, and by the way, the
auction has already started.

14:08.910 --> 14:12.429
- "Better get a move on before all the
good cars go." - Oh, OK.

14:12.430 --> 14:15.749
- Right, subway's this way.
- But, but, all right...

14:15.750 --> 14:18.829
Well, two things. First of all,
I'm just going to pretend

14:18.830 --> 14:21.069
I didn't see that thing you're
carrying your money in,

14:21.070 --> 14:24.469
and two, why take the subway? This
is a car show, not a train show.

14:24.470 --> 14:27.029
The most efficient public transport
system on the planet

14:27.030 --> 14:31.349
versus rush-hour in the busiest city
on the planet.

14:31.350 --> 14:33.069
OK, but if we take a taxi,

14:33.070 --> 14:35.309
we might get to see one of your
Toyota Enemas.

14:35.310 --> 14:37.630
- It's an Estima, and the tube's
faster. Bye! - OK...

14:40.310 --> 14:43.229
So if it was a race Chris wanted,
then fine,

14:43.230 --> 14:46.709
because while he became acquainted
with Tokyo's very Japanese

14:46.710 --> 14:48.349
subway system...

14:48.350 --> 14:49.829
Er...

14:49.830 --> 14:51.709
Oh, dear.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.149
Taxi!

14:53.150 --> 14:56.670
I discovered the city has
the world's sharpest-dressed
cab drivers.

15:04.070 --> 15:08.069
Yep, this would be my most
relaxing win yet.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.949
Nice, comfortable taxi.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.949
My man here, white hat,
white gloves,

15:12.950 --> 15:15.110
so he can never leave any
fingerprints.

15:19.230 --> 15:21.589
Yeah, that's probably just a
cultural thing.

15:21.590 --> 15:23.670
I'm sure it's no big deal.

15:25.910 --> 15:28.430
I haven't got a clue where I am now.

15:29.790 --> 15:31.709
Excuse me, do you speak English?

15:31.710 --> 15:33.669
No, OK, sorry. Chiba Ken?

15:33.670 --> 15:35.469
- Chiba Ken. - Chiba Ken.

15:35.470 --> 15:39.469
And while Chris was busy
unnerving the locals...

15:39.470 --> 15:41.509
Oh, sorry, sorry.

15:41.510 --> 15:45.269
..my driver was slicing through
Tokyo's sticky rush-hour traffic,

15:45.270 --> 15:48.430
and we were getting along like a
house on fire.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.029
Do you like that one?

16:00.030 --> 16:02.269
I'm just kidding,
I'm not really pregnant.

16:02.270 --> 16:05.549
Oh, just killing time in the tunnel,
you know.

16:05.550 --> 16:09.469
In fact, it wasn't so much a
question of who was going to win,

16:09.470 --> 16:12.869
but whether there'd be anything
left at the auction by the time
Chris got there.

16:12.870 --> 16:16.549
Here he goes. The driver's taking
his time, a nice, steady stop,

16:16.550 --> 16:19.669
so it's smooth, and then the driver
opens the doors.

16:19.670 --> 16:21.149
That takes too long.

16:21.150 --> 16:22.829
And then we count to, what, seven?

16:22.830 --> 16:25.829
One, two, three...

16:25.830 --> 16:30.549
So, unsurprisingly enough, I was
first to the auction.

16:30.550 --> 16:31.950
Wow!

16:33.630 --> 16:37.029
And it was massive.

16:37.030 --> 16:40.629
Oh, man, there's just
so much great stuff,

16:40.630 --> 16:43.670
and it just goes on for miles.

16:44.750 --> 16:49.229
The USS Tokyo car auction is one of
the biggest in the world,

16:49.230 --> 16:52.869
selling around 15,000 cars in a day,

16:52.870 --> 16:56.789
including hundreds of mint condition
'90s sports cars.

16:56.790 --> 16:59.030
GTR, there's a good car right there.

17:00.150 --> 17:03.189
But with only one hour left
until closing,

17:03.190 --> 17:04.709
I needed to start bidding.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.229
Jeez...

17:06.230 --> 17:08.108
But how?

17:08.109 --> 17:13.749
Here, over 2,500 bidders can compete
with up to 12 cars selling

17:13.750 --> 17:16.309
every 20 seconds.

17:16.310 --> 17:19.549
And with a million yen at stake,
this was less of an auction,

17:19.550 --> 17:22.989
and more some sort of weird casino.

17:22.990 --> 17:25.310
Oh, yeah.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.549
Oh...

17:33.550 --> 17:35.829
Did I just buy something?

17:35.830 --> 17:38.589
Well, well, well, better late than
never,

17:38.590 --> 17:42.269
but he still had to cross the
world's most distracting car park.

17:42.270 --> 17:46.269
Oh, Supra! Now, that... That might
be right in my price range.

17:46.270 --> 17:48.030
The Evo 7.

17:48.990 --> 17:52.429
Oh, look at this! I mean,
where do you turn?

17:52.430 --> 17:54.430
Shall I get that one?

17:55.990 --> 17:57.629
It's huge!

17:57.630 --> 17:59.270
Ah!

18:00.270 --> 18:01.909
Hey, there you are. Where you been?

18:01.910 --> 18:03.509
Under most of Tokyo.

18:03.510 --> 18:06.589
- What are you bidding on?
- Ah, well, I'm not really sure.

18:06.590 --> 18:08.989
I think this is the price going up,
obviously, and that's

18:08.990 --> 18:11.229
the lot number,
and what does that say?

18:11.230 --> 18:13.829
- Can you read that? - No.
- That must be what the car is, right?

18:13.830 --> 18:16.269
If I can't read that, why would I be
able to read that?

18:16.270 --> 18:18.589
Well, if you look, this is the same
in all of them.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.749
But there's only... There are
fixed...

18:20.750 --> 18:21.870
Maybe that means...

18:23.350 --> 18:25.349
Have you got an idea of what you
want to buy?

18:25.350 --> 18:27.789
I want something fast, manual, fast,

18:27.790 --> 18:29.869
maybe like a Skyline GTR.

18:29.870 --> 18:32.349
That would be nice.
Yeah, I'm sure you'll find one.

18:32.350 --> 18:36.149
He wouldn't. 1 million yen is,
in fact, about seven grand.

18:36.150 --> 18:38.989
- Oh, what's this? - That one, that one,
that one, that one, that one.

18:38.990 --> 18:40.509
Ah, missed it!

18:40.510 --> 18:42.989
So while Matt was set
for a disappointment,

18:42.990 --> 18:45.749
at least he'd worked out his own
bidding strategy.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.629
Are you trying to buy the entire
auction?

18:47.630 --> 18:50.149
No, no, I want that one, I want it,
I want it, I want it, I want it,

18:50.150 --> 18:52.550
I want it. Come on! There we go,
there we go.

18:54.150 --> 18:57.069
I got it. I got it!

18:57.070 --> 18:59.949
- I think I got it. Did you get one?
- Yep. - You did?

18:59.950 --> 19:02.109
- What did you get?
- It's gone now. You can't see it,

19:02.110 --> 19:04.710
but I am now the proud owner
of a car.

19:06.070 --> 19:08.469
The question was - what did he buy?

19:08.470 --> 19:10.830
In fact, what did I buy?

19:12.390 --> 19:15.229
It's like ordering food in a foreign
restaurant when you don't speak

19:15.230 --> 19:16.709
the language, you know what I mean?

19:16.710 --> 19:18.989
It's like, I'm really hoping I got
the grilled fillet,

19:18.990 --> 19:21.429
and not the poached anus.

19:21.430 --> 19:23.469
- Come on. - What?

19:23.470 --> 19:25.669
- Oh, here we go. - Oh...

19:25.670 --> 19:28.269
- Now that is my car!
- That's yellow.

19:28.270 --> 19:30.469
And there was nothing
anus-y about it.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.749
Mazda RX-7.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.189
Wow.

19:34.190 --> 19:37.269
That's the one with the twin turbo
rotary engine, right?

19:37.270 --> 19:38.629
Yep, absolutely right.

19:38.630 --> 19:42.069
Yep, the incredibly unreliable
twin turbo rotary engine?

19:42.070 --> 19:44.869
Come on, don't buy into that. They
can be a little bit temperamental,

19:44.870 --> 19:46.469
but that's the whole point.

19:46.470 --> 19:48.509
- What, what, what?
- When you go abroad,

19:48.510 --> 19:51.989
you don't order a pint of John
Smith's, you order the local beer.

19:51.990 --> 19:54.069
This, here, is the local beer.

19:54.070 --> 19:56.149
Only Japan could have made this car.

19:56.150 --> 19:58.869
Only Japan shouldn't have made this
car.

19:58.870 --> 20:00.629
The rotary motor was junk.

20:00.630 --> 20:04.189
They rev beautifully, they're sweet,
they're lovely little things.

20:04.190 --> 20:06.789
They wear out in ten minutes!

20:06.790 --> 20:11.989
Nonsense. She was a minter, and, at
an easy 15 grand in the UK,

20:11.990 --> 20:14.029
I had hit the jackpot.

20:14.030 --> 20:16.029
Question was, had Matt?

20:16.030 --> 20:18.189
Oh, yeah!

20:18.190 --> 20:20.029
That's me, right there.

20:20.030 --> 20:25.789
The Nissan Skyline R34 GTR, huh?

20:25.790 --> 20:29.229
That is a classic.
Everyone knows the GTR.

20:29.230 --> 20:31.189
Everyone apart from you, Matthew.

20:31.190 --> 20:34.029
- What do you mean?
- That's a GTT.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.389
- GTT? - GTT. - I thought it was a typo!

20:36.390 --> 20:37.710
No, no, no...

20:38.910 --> 20:41.909
So, do you know what
makes a GTT special?

20:41.910 --> 20:44.349
- I, I don't. What? - That it's
missing a turbocharger,

20:44.350 --> 20:48.189
it's missing the front-driven axle,
so it's only two-wheel drive,

20:48.190 --> 20:49.709
it's missing a load of power.

20:49.710 --> 20:52.949
- It's like a GTR,
but just a bit - BLEEP.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.869
Cheaper, too.

20:54.870 --> 20:58.629
A GTR could have fetched 40 grand in
the UK, but annoyingly,

20:58.630 --> 21:02.829
my GTT was worth about the same as
Chris's RX-7.

21:02.830 --> 21:04.349
Am I crazy about the body?

21:04.350 --> 21:07.549
No, and even on the GTR, I wasn't
crazy about the body shape.

21:07.550 --> 21:10.189
- I think it's... - It's not even the
car you thought you'd bought!

21:10.190 --> 21:12.789
- Well, I didn't know what I...
I was surprised I got a car... - Hi.

21:12.790 --> 21:15.350
- Sorry. How are you?
Thank you. - Thank you.

21:16.390 --> 21:18.029
Thank you.

21:18.030 --> 21:19.949
"Well done on buying some cars."

21:19.950 --> 21:22.469
- OK. - "We've laid on the transport to
get them home."

21:22.470 --> 21:26.149
- That's nice of the producers.
- "The transport leaves in two days'
time from Enbu.

21:26.150 --> 21:29.069
- "Please drive there." - So we have to
take them on a trip now?

21:29.070 --> 21:31.509
- Yes. - It's a good thing you bought a
reliable car.

21:31.510 --> 21:34.750
- Can I trade it back in...?
- No, you can't, nope.

21:37.910 --> 21:40.389
On the road, and our destination
at Enbu

21:40.390 --> 21:43.869
was just a couple of hundred
miles to the north of Tokyo.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.429
But with two days to reach it,

21:46.430 --> 21:50.509
we'd been told first to make a
detour towards the hills,

21:50.510 --> 21:53.870
and that left us with plenty of time
to get to know what we'd bought.

21:54.910 --> 21:58.669
Three reasons why the RX-7 rocked.

21:58.670 --> 22:00.149
First of all, the styling.

22:00.150 --> 22:02.629
It must be one of the best looking
Japanese cars ever.

22:02.630 --> 22:06.949
Look at this bodywork. It's just
shrunk over the shape of the car

22:06.950 --> 22:08.909
in the most lovely shapes.

22:08.910 --> 22:11.629
Second of all, pop-up headlights.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.949
Everyone loves a pop-up headlight.

22:14.950 --> 22:19.109
Thirdly, this was the first-ever
sequentially turbo-charged

22:19.110 --> 22:23.789
rotary engine production car, and it
made close to 300 horsepower.

22:23.790 --> 22:28.909
Now, it didn't exactly start a
rotary engine revolution.

22:28.910 --> 22:32.189
In fact, the unique design of the
Wankel engine, as it's known,

22:32.190 --> 22:34.189
drinks so much fuel and oil

22:34.190 --> 22:37.269
that no other manufacturer has ever
followed suit.

22:37.270 --> 22:41.189
But, when they were working well,
as this one is now,

22:41.190 --> 22:42.589
there's nothing like them.

22:42.590 --> 22:45.110
It just revs perfectly.

22:46.390 --> 22:49.349
And while the RX-7 and I were
getting on famously,

22:49.350 --> 22:51.309
over in his low-spec Skyline,

22:51.310 --> 22:54.629
Matt has had time to put a positive
spin on things.

22:54.630 --> 22:57.189
OK, so I may not have chosen the car
that I thought I'd chose,

22:57.190 --> 22:59.789
but it turns out I accidentally made
a pretty good choice.

22:59.790 --> 23:01.829
This is basically a GTR.

23:01.830 --> 23:04.429
It's got one turbo, instead of two,

23:04.430 --> 23:06.229
one fewer thing to go wrong,

23:06.230 --> 23:08.669
it's got rear-wheel drive instead
of four-wheel drive,

23:08.670 --> 23:10.949
so it's the purist's choice,

23:10.950 --> 23:13.709
and this car has four-wheel
steering.

23:13.710 --> 23:17.149
Now that's the kind of technology
you really only find on your latest

23:17.150 --> 23:19.990
Ferraris and Porsches and Mercedes.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.390
I'm accidentally awesome.

23:26.310 --> 23:28.630
Before long, we reached the hills.

23:30.070 --> 23:31.909
And pulling off the main highway,

23:31.910 --> 23:34.750
our sports cars started
to feel right at home.

23:37.030 --> 23:39.309
These are great roads.

23:39.310 --> 23:42.469
Now it becomes quite touge-like.

23:42.470 --> 23:46.030
Japanese for mountain pass,
touge roads are legendary.

23:47.630 --> 23:49.509
Narrow, twisting tarmac,

23:49.510 --> 23:53.869
where Japan's sports car enthusiasts
have always come to play.

23:53.870 --> 23:57.790
Oh, what is this? There's a guy in
the road, guy in the road up here.

24:02.350 --> 24:04.269
I think he needs a
little lube on his arm.

24:04.270 --> 24:06.070
He is, um, squeaky.

24:07.310 --> 24:08.709
All right, challenge.

24:08.710 --> 24:11.589
"To test your car's performance
before export to the UK,

24:11.590 --> 24:15.829
"you will now race around the famous
Gunsai touge road

24:15.830 --> 24:18.309
"while each carrying a passenger."

24:18.310 --> 24:20.629
Is that where we are now,
the Gunsai touge?

24:20.630 --> 24:23.149
- I guess so. - I have wanted to come
here all my life.

24:23.150 --> 24:26.909
- Have you? - This is where the Japanese
best motoring guys used to skid

24:26.910 --> 24:30.189
S2000s, MX-5s, sorry,
Miata, for you.

24:30.190 --> 24:34.829
Yeah. OK. All right, don't look now,
but there are two very large,

24:34.830 --> 24:37.750
mostly naked, men standing right
behind you.

24:39.030 --> 24:41.189
Yes, sumo wrestlers.

24:41.190 --> 24:44.309
From a sport which actually bans its
stars from driving,

24:44.310 --> 24:46.709
they make ideal passenger seat
ballast

24:46.710 --> 24:50.149
to really put our sports
cars to the test.

24:50.150 --> 24:53.789
- Hi. - They're never going to fit
in the cars, are they?

24:53.790 --> 24:59.069
Ahead of us lay a 1.4 mile loop
of closed touge road.

24:59.070 --> 25:01.989
Designed to test our cars' handling,

25:01.990 --> 25:06.150
we'd be racing two laps of this
fast, technical course.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.910
Who would win in a fight between
you two guys?

25:17.270 --> 25:19.630
You. Ha-ha, that's what I'm talking
about!

25:22.030 --> 25:23.670
OK, we're a team...

25:25.110 --> 25:27.350
We're a team?

25:37.190 --> 25:38.709
What a start!

25:38.710 --> 25:40.469
Yes!

25:40.470 --> 25:42.110
Come on, baby, come on!

25:46.030 --> 25:49.430
Tuck in behind me, Le Blanc.
Get used to being there.

25:59.390 --> 26:02.030
He can't overtake us here.
He can't get us here!

26:03.430 --> 26:05.869
Wrong, Harris, very wrong.

26:05.870 --> 26:08.270
You cheeky little...

26:09.270 --> 26:12.070
That's what I'm talking about!
Woohoo!

26:13.870 --> 26:15.350
Oh, a little too hot...

26:22.910 --> 26:24.909
Nah!

26:24.910 --> 26:26.389
I like that. We're through!

26:26.390 --> 26:29.189
I'm sorry about that, he got me!

26:29.190 --> 26:31.510
All right, come on, think light,
big boy, think light!

26:32.830 --> 26:34.829
With the road running out...

26:34.830 --> 26:37.749
Feel that smooth, rotary power,
my friend.

26:37.750 --> 26:40.269
The RX-7 had just enough...

26:40.270 --> 26:41.789
Come on, come on.

26:41.790 --> 26:44.389
..to keep the GTT at bay.

26:44.390 --> 26:46.430
It's a victory!

26:57.950 --> 27:00.549
I would have had you if I didn't
blow it in the hairpin down there.

27:00.550 --> 27:02.069
It was close, it was close.

27:02.070 --> 27:07.309
Do you think sumo mid-90s slightly
ropey sports car racing

27:07.310 --> 27:08.709
is a new sport?

27:08.710 --> 27:12.590
I think absolutely, right?
That's what my guy says.

27:14.510 --> 27:18.829
With the day drawing to a close,
leaving the touge roads behind,

27:18.830 --> 27:20.629
we got back on the highway.

27:20.630 --> 27:22.510
Well... almost.

27:25.870 --> 27:29.269
- Oh, no. - Chris, why are you stopped
at the toll?

27:29.270 --> 27:32.269
Why do you think I'm stopped
at the toll?

27:32.270 --> 27:35.790
I don't know why you're stopped at
the toll, that's why I'm asking you.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.990
He's just shouting at me.

27:40.190 --> 27:42.709
My Japanese is very weak.

27:42.710 --> 27:46.149
It extends to... Honda.

27:46.150 --> 27:48.029
Now, see, this is interesting.

27:48.030 --> 27:50.589
This is where we find out how
impatient Mr Harris is.

27:50.590 --> 27:52.669
You watch what's going to happen
here.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.510
He has the patience of a gnat.

27:56.270 --> 27:57.869
I've got three people behind me now.

27:57.870 --> 27:59.349
Back? Back?

27:59.350 --> 28:01.470
Back?

28:03.430 --> 28:05.989
- BLEEP - hell!

28:05.990 --> 28:09.590
Finally free of the toll booths,
the next challenge was dinner.

28:11.030 --> 28:14.589
And we soon discovered that, no
matter how far you travel,

28:14.590 --> 28:16.749
food from motorway services...

28:16.750 --> 28:18.189
Let's see what we've got here...

28:18.190 --> 28:19.389
..sucks.

28:19.390 --> 28:20.629
Oh!

28:20.630 --> 28:22.630
Oh, that's not nice!

28:24.430 --> 28:28.109
That's bad. Wow, I'm going to close
that back up, OK?

28:28.110 --> 28:30.630
That's going to get in the
"wish we didn't get those" pile.

28:32.390 --> 28:34.269
That was rank.

28:34.270 --> 28:37.070
What about these? What are these?
Some kind of egg thing.

28:38.790 --> 28:40.150
Yeah.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.349
- Come on. - Eat that!

28:43.350 --> 28:45.910
- Is it that bad?
- Eat that!

28:54.630 --> 28:58.190
Suffice to say, the meal
was an education.

29:01.030 --> 29:03.429
So, after a hungry night,

29:03.430 --> 29:08.109
the next morning we hit the road
early for another day of discovery.

29:08.110 --> 29:11.109
The Japanese are the masters of the
weird car name.

29:11.110 --> 29:13.189
Allow me to give you some examples.

29:13.190 --> 29:16.989
The Suzuki Every Joypop Turbo -
how about that one?

29:16.990 --> 29:21.629
Or an Isuzu Mysterious Utility
Wizard.

29:21.630 --> 29:25.030
Or the Honda Lovely Lady Garden.

29:27.110 --> 29:29.229
Those aren't real car names.

29:29.230 --> 29:32.829
Yeah, you're right, I made the last
one up, but the others, I promise
you, are real.

29:32.830 --> 29:35.030
But the last one was
my favourite one.

29:37.790 --> 29:39.709
We picked up the route to Enbu,

29:39.710 --> 29:42.029
following the main highway north

29:42.030 --> 29:45.230
and soon our journey took us into
new territory.

29:46.230 --> 29:49.669
Hey, Chris, look at this sign. What
is that? Is that a Geiger counter?

29:49.670 --> 29:52.069
That's a radiation meter.
Look at that.

29:52.070 --> 29:55.549
Oh, crikey. So we're actually quite
close to, erm...

29:55.550 --> 29:58.990
Fukushima, where they had the big
disaster in 2011.

30:00.670 --> 30:03.950
We were approaching the Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant.

30:05.150 --> 30:08.669
Critically damaged by a tsunami in
the wake of one of the largest

30:08.670 --> 30:11.189
earthquakes ever recorded in Japan,

30:11.190 --> 30:15.069
a 20km exclusion zone was
set up around the plant.

30:15.070 --> 30:18.749
In one day, the entire local
population

30:18.750 --> 30:23.029
was evacuated to escape
the dangers of radiation.

30:23.030 --> 30:25.869
Experts predict the clear-up
operation at Daiichi

30:25.870 --> 30:28.310
could take up to 40 years.

30:29.870 --> 30:33.150
For now, the area remains largely
uninhabited.

30:40.030 --> 30:43.590
An area that we were granted special
permission to witness first-hand.

30:48.950 --> 30:53.229
We're 5km from the
reactor that blew here.

30:53.230 --> 30:55.670
Are we really that close?

30:56.990 --> 30:59.069
You read about it and you see the
pictures,

30:59.070 --> 31:03.589
but until you come here and just see
the way people have abandoned

31:03.590 --> 31:06.470
their lives involuntarily...

31:08.270 --> 31:11.029
It doesn't really hit you until you
see it, does it?

31:11.030 --> 31:12.710
No, it doesn't.

31:14.550 --> 31:18.109
You think about all the people that
got displaced over this.

31:18.110 --> 31:21.949
There were 160,000 people here.

31:21.950 --> 31:26.269
That's the population of Oxford and
they were just gone in one day.

31:26.270 --> 31:27.470
Gone, bye.

31:28.870 --> 31:30.990
Just terrible.

31:40.110 --> 31:43.469
Just seems that somebody saved up
their pennies and bought their dream

31:43.470 --> 31:45.869
Porsche and they've driven it home
one night from work,

31:45.870 --> 31:48.189
parked it up and then never got to
see it again.

31:48.190 --> 31:50.669
You don't own a car like this unless
you love cars

31:50.670 --> 31:53.949
and yet the dangers here were so
great that they were willing

31:53.950 --> 31:55.550
to just leave it behind and run.

32:01.630 --> 32:04.829
Kids' shoes and...

32:04.830 --> 32:07.469
Dishware and...

32:07.470 --> 32:09.069
Whoa.

32:09.070 --> 32:11.189
I mean, this was probably a family
lived here

32:11.190 --> 32:13.630
and just, their whole
lives were just gone.

32:19.110 --> 32:21.549
This is awful.

32:21.550 --> 32:23.470
It was time to move on.

32:27.550 --> 32:28.910
That's a hard one to shake.

32:30.070 --> 32:31.870
That's a hard one to shake.

32:36.550 --> 32:38.349
I've got to say, that was eerie.

32:38.350 --> 32:40.429
I mean, the size of the exclusion
zone...

32:40.430 --> 32:42.389
I don't think I'll ever forget that.

32:42.390 --> 32:45.589
The scale of the clean-up is just
absolutely immense.

32:45.590 --> 32:49.149
It's one of the biggest engineering
challenges of our time.

32:49.150 --> 32:52.069
They're talking 30, 40 years.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.669
I've never seen anything like it.

32:53.670 --> 32:56.749
Yeah. Right, well, we'll pick up the
rest of that road trip

32:56.750 --> 32:58.109
a little later in the show.

32:58.110 --> 33:01.909
- Rory. - Now, while Matt and Chris were
off filming that,

33:01.910 --> 33:04.390
I was on a Japanese mission
of my own.

33:06.950 --> 33:12.149
Back in Tokyo, I'd been given just
one night to delve into the more

33:12.150 --> 33:15.190
unusual side of
Japanese car culture.

33:16.510 --> 33:21.390
And I thought I'd begin with the
very USUAL Daihatsu Tanto.

33:23.630 --> 33:26.189
If you really want
to understand Japan,

33:26.190 --> 33:28.150
this is where you need to look.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.509
The Kei car.

33:35.510 --> 33:38.229
Because in the world's
most populated city,

33:38.230 --> 33:42.869
Tokyo's 38 million inhabitants have
long been torn between a love

33:42.870 --> 33:45.069
of cars and a lack of space.

33:45.070 --> 33:47.590
And for many, these are the answer.

33:48.550 --> 33:52.869
Kei cars make up about 40% of the
cars on the road over here.

33:52.870 --> 33:55.749
There's one. There's another one.

33:55.750 --> 33:56.870
They're all Kei cars.

33:58.310 --> 34:01.149
And they're all built to a set of
regulations

34:01.150 --> 34:04.869
that makes the Formula 1
rule book look laid-back.

34:04.870 --> 34:08.469
The engines are all exactly 660 cc.

34:08.469 --> 34:11.789
They're all limited to 63 horsepower

34:11.790 --> 34:14.790
and they're all incredibly slow.

34:16.830 --> 34:21.909
It was introduced in 1949 as an
affordable post-war alternative to

34:21.909 --> 34:25.309
the motorcycle. And as the Japanese
population boomed,

34:25.310 --> 34:28.909
the Kei car's frugal and compact
formula was future-proof.

34:31.110 --> 34:34.748
You see, in Tokyo,
because space is so tight,

34:34.750 --> 34:38.708
you can't actually buy a car unless
you can prove you actually have the

34:38.710 --> 34:41.909
space to park it. That's why these
things are so popular.

34:44.389 --> 34:48.989
The Kei car is all about sacrificing
the individual for the good of the

34:48.989 --> 34:51.029
many. Everything in order.

34:51.030 --> 34:54.349
Button-down. To hell with
creativity.

34:54.350 --> 34:56.949
But here's the thing about
creativity.

34:56.949 --> 35:02.829
No matter how tightly you button it
down, it always finds a way out.

35:02.830 --> 35:05.910
And the tighter you button, the
weirder it comes out.

35:07.630 --> 35:11.749
Because after dark, while the rest
of the city sleeps,

35:11.750 --> 35:15.990
Tokyo's less conventional drivers
come out to play.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.509
Oh, yes!

35:23.510 --> 35:25.430
Bosozoku style!

35:26.790 --> 35:30.269
A small corner of automotive
self-expression

35:30.270 --> 35:32.389
that's all about extremes.

35:32.390 --> 35:33.830
Sick!

35:35.510 --> 35:38.749
I'm not going to lie - this is a
little bit intimidating.

35:38.750 --> 35:40.749
I don't really want
to say the wrong thing.

35:40.750 --> 35:44.469
These guys come with a certain
reputation.

35:44.470 --> 35:46.749
With its origins in gang culture,

35:46.750 --> 35:50.829
Bosozoku style today takes
once stock Japanese classics

35:50.830 --> 35:53.069
and wildly remodels them.

35:53.070 --> 35:54.669
Look at this!

35:54.670 --> 35:56.150
What is this, metal?

35:57.350 --> 35:59.069
That looks dangerous, man.

35:59.070 --> 36:01.869
Its trademarks are flamboyant
exhausts,

36:01.870 --> 36:05.749
extreme flared arches and snowplough
ground clearance.

36:05.750 --> 36:08.989
- This yours? - Yeah, street racer.

36:08.990 --> 36:10.989
This is nice.

36:10.990 --> 36:12.949
But what are they like to drive?

36:12.950 --> 36:17.949
Well, after a bit of negotiation, I
was given the chance to find out.

36:17.950 --> 36:19.909
I can drive? You sure?

36:19.910 --> 36:21.429
Arigato. Arigato, arigato.

36:21.430 --> 36:23.390
Oh, my God. Come on!

36:26.430 --> 36:29.029
Oh, mate!

36:29.030 --> 36:31.870
- Yeah! - Enjoy. Oh, I will enjoy, don't
you worry.

36:52.950 --> 36:55.270
This is more my style.
I want one of these.

37:00.390 --> 37:04.029
Bosozoku is everything a Kei car
isn't -

37:04.030 --> 37:07.070
anti-social and on the fringes
of legality.

37:08.350 --> 37:10.349
The story goes that in the '50s,

37:10.350 --> 37:14.709
kamikaze pilots coming back from war
kind of needed a new hobby.

37:14.710 --> 37:19.109
So they took to modifying their
motorcycles with crazy exhausts and

37:19.110 --> 37:23.469
all kinds of ornaments, generally
getting up to havoc in city centres,

37:23.470 --> 37:25.469
creating high jinks.

37:25.470 --> 37:28.790
Occasionally organised
crime-flavoured high jinks.

37:31.030 --> 37:35.589
Anyhow, the Bosozoku tuning style
moved away from gang culture and

37:35.590 --> 37:39.869
into cars and so many definitely
law-abiding years later,

37:39.870 --> 37:41.990
we end up with these.

37:44.110 --> 37:45.550
Argh!

37:49.110 --> 37:50.830
I'm pretty sure this is not legal.

37:55.630 --> 37:58.830
If you want to show off,
you couldn't do much better.

37:59.950 --> 38:03.469
Except, of course, this is Tokyo.

38:03.470 --> 38:05.509
Oh, hello! Lambos!

38:05.510 --> 38:07.270
Oh, yes!

38:08.310 --> 38:09.909
Yes!

38:09.910 --> 38:12.949
Oh, yes!

38:12.950 --> 38:14.630
Oh, that is nuts.

38:16.150 --> 38:17.669
Oh, yes!

38:17.670 --> 38:19.269
Yeah! Yeah!

38:19.270 --> 38:21.309
Loving your style, mate.

38:21.310 --> 38:22.910
Loving your style.

38:24.270 --> 38:26.150
I am completely out of my depth
here.

38:30.270 --> 38:32.149
Let's work, come on.

38:32.150 --> 38:34.549
I'm pretty sure that's fine.

38:34.550 --> 38:36.270
Wait for me, wait for me!

38:45.470 --> 38:47.949
Oh, my lord!

38:47.950 --> 38:49.150
Yes!

38:50.630 --> 38:53.029
In Japan's underground car scene,

38:53.030 --> 38:56.749
even the deepest pockets are out
to make a statement.

38:56.750 --> 39:00.909
For this lot, the supercar
is just the start.

39:00.910 --> 39:02.590
And I had to blag a go.

39:04.230 --> 39:06.629
Oh, my

39:06.630 --> 39:07.670
God!

39:18.510 --> 39:22.709
I'll be honest, this is turning into
one of the stranger nights

39:22.710 --> 39:24.110
of my life.

39:26.870 --> 39:31.709
Again, if you're asking why, why
cover a Lambo in neon lights,

39:31.710 --> 39:34.510
glitter and fake bullet holes?

39:36.110 --> 39:38.830
Japan's answer is quite
simply, why not?

39:42.230 --> 39:44.949
The world is all about uniqueness
these days.

39:44.950 --> 39:48.549
You buy a brand-new mini and there
are literally millions of options

39:48.550 --> 39:52.149
for customisation. Union Jack roof,
bonnet stripes.

39:52.150 --> 39:53.629
This is the same thing.

39:53.630 --> 39:55.350
It just takes it a little bit
further.

39:56.510 --> 39:59.869
But there's more to it than that
because the people who run these

39:59.870 --> 40:03.469
kaleidoscopic supercars say they
have a grander mission.

40:03.470 --> 40:06.829
You see, the number of under-30s
with a driving licence is falling

40:06.830 --> 40:11.509
every year in Japan, down by a third
since the turn of the century.

40:11.510 --> 40:15.389
And they reckon it's all the boring
Kei cars that are the problem.

40:15.390 --> 40:17.829
Make more stuff like this, they say,

40:17.830 --> 40:19.870
and the kids will come flooding back
to cars.

40:21.030 --> 40:24.149
And, to be fair,
they may have a point.

40:24.150 --> 40:25.910
Yeah, go ahead -
Instagram it, come on!

40:26.870 --> 40:28.230
I know you want to.

40:30.150 --> 40:34.829
Like them or not, you can't deny the
sheer flamboyance of these cars does

40:34.830 --> 40:37.509
make for a spectacular sight.

40:37.510 --> 40:41.869
But the problem with neon Lambos out
here is that they're just a bit...

40:41.870 --> 40:47.789
A bit common. If you want something
that's genuinely, utterly unique,

40:47.790 --> 40:49.670
you've got to dig
a little bit deeper.

41:19.150 --> 41:20.950
This is the Porsche 962.

41:22.590 --> 41:26.509
Three-time winner of the 24 hours
of Le Mans,

41:26.510 --> 41:29.390
it was one of the most dominant
race cars of its day.

41:30.590 --> 41:33.709
But what is really special about
this 962

41:33.710 --> 41:36.829
is that it isn't just a
race car.

41:36.830 --> 41:42.229
Here in Japan, this 962
is road legal.

41:42.230 --> 41:43.630
And I'm going to drive it.

41:53.070 --> 41:56.229
With my one night in Tokyo
coming to an end,

41:56.230 --> 41:59.229
it was time to leave the
city sprawl behind

41:59.230 --> 42:01.070
and head for the hills.

42:02.190 --> 42:05.029
Because a car like this deserves -

42:05.030 --> 42:08.510
no, demands - a proper road.

42:15.630 --> 42:18.549
Listen to the noise!

42:18.550 --> 42:20.990
Oh!

42:22.390 --> 42:25.789
This is nuts!
This is absolutely nuts.

42:25.790 --> 42:30.670
I'm driving a
Porsche Le Mans car on the road!

42:32.910 --> 42:36.549
The engine is a twin turbo-charged
flat six

42:36.550 --> 42:39.669
that makes about 630 horsepower.

42:39.670 --> 42:44.629
That might not sound like an awful
lot in today's crazy world,

42:44.630 --> 42:47.709
but you've got to remember two
things.

42:47.710 --> 42:52.029
First of all, this car only weighs
800kg.

42:52.030 --> 42:54.549
That's about as much as air weighs.

42:54.550 --> 42:56.749
And secondly,

42:56.750 --> 42:59.989
you've got to remember that the
traction control system

42:59.990 --> 43:01.550
is this guy!

43:16.870 --> 43:18.230
This is insane.

43:23.470 --> 43:26.270
What a day. What a day!

43:27.750 --> 43:29.710
Whoo!

43:35.990 --> 43:40.309
If, like me, you've ever worried the
world's roads are becoming lost

43:40.310 --> 43:44.190
to beige SUVs and
anonymous hatchbacks,

43:45.750 --> 43:47.709
don't.

43:47.710 --> 43:48.909
Come to Japan.

43:48.910 --> 43:51.709
The world of cars is alive and well

43:51.710 --> 43:55.590
and weirder than you could
ever hope.

43:58.190 --> 44:00.910
And that is worth travelling for.

44:07.630 --> 44:09.149
So jealous.

44:09.150 --> 44:11.349
- Yeah. - Wow.

44:11.350 --> 44:15.189
I have to say, that did look great.
A Porsche 962 on the road?

44:15.190 --> 44:17.949
- It's proper bucket list stuff.
- I know. Honestly, it really was.

44:17.950 --> 44:20.349
It was just the most incredible
12 hours.

44:20.350 --> 44:22.189
What about the 13th hour?

44:22.190 --> 44:25.429
Do you want to show what happened
when you were driving the very rare,

44:25.430 --> 44:27.589
very expensive Porsche
back from the shoot?

44:27.590 --> 44:29.189
No. No, I don't.

44:29.190 --> 44:31.749
Well, we have some footage.

44:31.750 --> 44:33.230
Look at this.

44:38.990 --> 44:42.150
Yeah, I think something's
broken in this.

44:44.350 --> 44:46.430
Yeah, I've got smoke,
I've got smoke.

44:52.670 --> 44:54.669
Please don't clap that.

44:54.670 --> 44:56.709
That looked significant.

44:56.710 --> 44:58.309
- Yeah. - What was wrong?

44:58.310 --> 45:01.710
Well, we kind of narrowed it down to
the engine region.

45:03.470 --> 45:05.789
- So what did you do? - I legged it!

45:05.790 --> 45:09.389
Great, so if any of you out there
fancy a broken Le Mans Porsche,

45:09.390 --> 45:12.349
head to the Hakone turnpike just
outside of Odawara.

45:12.350 --> 45:13.710
Yeah, and bring a spanner.

45:15.270 --> 45:18.189
Right, time to get back to our big
Japanese road trip.

45:18.190 --> 45:21.429
As you'll remember, Chris and I had
been tasked with buying a couple of

45:21.430 --> 45:24.549
'90s sports cars and shipping them
back to the UK

45:24.550 --> 45:26.509
to try and turn a profit.

45:26.510 --> 45:29.989
You rejoin us the following morning
when we'd been told to head to a

45:29.990 --> 45:32.230
local race circuit for another
challenge.

45:36.590 --> 45:41.150
The racetrack we'd been sent to was
buried deep in the forest.

45:44.110 --> 45:46.310
And as we'd come to expect
from Japan,

45:47.390 --> 45:50.750
it wasn't quite what we'd expected.

45:53.430 --> 45:55.750
What is this?
Are we in the right place?

45:58.110 --> 46:01.510
What kind of a racetrack has large
statues of monkeys?

46:03.270 --> 46:05.589
Is it a racetrack, or a zoo?

46:05.590 --> 46:08.709
Perhaps it was a bit of both.

46:08.710 --> 46:11.190
Because this was Ebisu -

46:14.590 --> 46:17.670
home to the wilder animals of
Japanese motorsport.

46:21.310 --> 46:23.350
What is that?

46:27.870 --> 46:30.150
Yes, this is drifting.

46:39.670 --> 46:42.389
You know that moment when you're
about to crash that seems to last

46:42.390 --> 46:45.229
forever? They've taken that moment
and stretched it out

46:45.230 --> 46:47.789
- and turned it into a motorsport.
- What could be better?

46:47.790 --> 46:48.910
Nothing.

46:51.910 --> 46:53.909
Starting out as an illegal race
scene

46:53.910 --> 46:57.349
on Japan's touge mountain
roads back in the '90s,

46:57.350 --> 46:59.950
drifting has evolved into
disciplines like this.

47:03.630 --> 47:06.829
Known as Tsuiso,
drivers run in pairs,

47:06.830 --> 47:10.510
drifting as close and as fast as
possible in parallel.

47:12.790 --> 47:16.229
And, worryingly, it was just then
that our challenge arrived.

47:16.230 --> 47:17.549
Hi. Hi.

47:17.550 --> 47:19.109
- A challenge. - Thank you.

47:19.110 --> 47:20.669
Thank you.

47:20.670 --> 47:22.349
What have we got? What have we got?

47:22.350 --> 47:26.189
Nice helmet design. "Because you've
both bought rear-wheel drive
Japanese sports cars,

47:26.190 --> 47:29.309
"it's time for you to team up for a
drift challenge against a

47:29.310 --> 47:30.750
"team of Japanese aces."

47:32.230 --> 47:36.269
- Those guys?
- Not those guys, those guys.

47:36.270 --> 47:37.950
Well, which guys are those guys?

47:41.430 --> 47:43.309
Yep, these guys.

47:43.310 --> 47:47.910
Matchbox-sized Kei car pick-ups from
the shallower end of the drift pool.

47:51.670 --> 47:54.189
So, issued with beginners' safety
goggles...

47:54.190 --> 47:55.949
Looking good!

47:55.950 --> 47:59.749
..and a set of super-skinny rear
tyres to help us slide,

47:59.750 --> 48:02.190
we headed out for some practice.

48:05.950 --> 48:07.750
This is brilliant!

48:09.750 --> 48:14.550
And, OK, some of us needed more
practice than others.

48:16.230 --> 48:18.709
It's so tricky.

48:18.710 --> 48:21.310
Keep going. It's going to come.
I know it is!

48:22.590 --> 48:24.589
I can't see with those
stupid things on.

48:24.590 --> 48:26.030
Oh, there's the road.

48:31.510 --> 48:34.150
That's it, Matt. Keep it going,
Matt. Keep it going, Matthew.

48:36.590 --> 48:38.190
That's better! That's better!

48:39.270 --> 48:42.150
But getting the hang of the drift
was only half the battle.

48:44.190 --> 48:46.870
To compete, we'd need to do it in
tandem.

48:50.590 --> 48:52.310
It's so hard to stay together.

49:03.750 --> 49:05.550
I lost a wheel. Lost the wheel.

49:06.750 --> 49:10.229
With no time left to practise,
there was only one way to make sure

49:10.230 --> 49:12.830
we'd nail the art
of the parallel drift.

49:16.470 --> 49:18.069
Problem solved.

49:18.070 --> 49:20.309
And starting at the front
of the grid,

49:20.310 --> 49:23.189
the aim of this challenge would be
to stay ahead

49:23.190 --> 49:27.269
of the Kei car drifters for two laps
of sideways action.

49:27.270 --> 49:28.829
Any tips?

49:28.830 --> 49:32.469
Take it nice and smooth,
instigate the transition positively,

49:32.470 --> 49:34.909
and try and stay alive.

49:34.910 --> 49:37.429
OK.

49:37.430 --> 49:40.150
Three, two, one...

49:45.110 --> 49:47.629
Now, in a stroke of genius,

49:47.630 --> 49:52.069
lashing our cars together had turned
us into a rolling road block.

49:52.070 --> 49:55.029
- You've got to steer! - I am steering!

49:55.030 --> 49:57.789
So, while the other teams struggled
to get past,

49:57.790 --> 50:00.109
we were free to concentrate on our
technique.

50:00.110 --> 50:01.989
- OK, ready? - OK.

50:01.990 --> 50:03.670
Steer, steer!

50:06.670 --> 50:08.630
And, unbelievably...

50:10.950 --> 50:15.470
Our improvised answer to the perfect
tandem drift actually worked.

50:19.630 --> 50:22.309
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

50:22.310 --> 50:24.590
Woohoo!

50:26.910 --> 50:28.469
OK, get ready.

50:28.470 --> 50:29.750
- Go! - Steer, steer!

50:33.270 --> 50:36.029
- Nice! - Yeah, we've got it.

50:36.030 --> 50:39.189
Ready, ready, ready?

50:39.190 --> 50:40.470
Handbrake.

50:43.070 --> 50:46.309
Against the odds, with the Kei cars
still at bay,

50:46.310 --> 50:48.869
we were looking good for the win.

50:48.870 --> 50:51.070
Right, ready, ready, ready?
Full power, full power.

51:00.030 --> 51:01.749
It's going great!

51:01.750 --> 51:04.550
But with just half
a lap between us and victory...

51:07.470 --> 51:08.749
Whoa!

51:08.750 --> 51:10.430
It broke!

51:22.510 --> 51:24.229
It was working so well.

51:24.230 --> 51:26.430
I don't understand
why it went wrong.

51:27.790 --> 51:31.990
Out of the race, we handed the Kei
car pick-ups a solid one-two finish.

51:33.230 --> 51:36.470
But frankly, we had bigger things
to worry about.

51:38.110 --> 51:40.989
- My car is shagged. - Wow.

51:40.990 --> 51:44.749
Now, is it the goal to buy these
for a million yen...

51:44.750 --> 51:49.269
- Yeah. - ..get them back to the UK and
sell them and make a profit?

51:49.270 --> 51:51.109
Ooh, what do you think?

51:51.110 --> 51:55.589
Well, it's often said that a racing
car that's enjoyed huge success

51:55.590 --> 51:57.629
like, win the Le Mans 24 hours,

51:57.630 --> 52:00.829
if you leave it after the race
untouched, you don't clean it,

52:00.830 --> 52:04.309
- you leave all the patination and the
life, it's worth more money. - Uh-huh.

52:04.310 --> 52:05.709
So, what race is this?

52:05.710 --> 52:09.549
The near the weird zoo drift
place...

52:09.550 --> 52:11.390
- Challenge. - Yes!

52:12.630 --> 52:15.229
- That adds value. - Yeah.
- I think that adds value.

52:15.230 --> 52:19.669
Now, a busy morning "adding value"
does build an appetite,

52:19.670 --> 52:21.669
so we left Ebisu behind

52:21.670 --> 52:24.709
and this time Matt sensibly
suggested we skip

52:24.710 --> 52:28.549
the service station eggs and go for
one of his favourite local dishes.

52:28.550 --> 52:31.269
- What's this?
- Oh, have you ever had wanko soba?

52:31.270 --> 52:33.309
No, I like a couple of beers first,
normally.

52:33.310 --> 52:35.389
No, no, it's a Japanese delicacy.

52:35.390 --> 52:38.469
Honestly, I love wanko.

52:38.470 --> 52:39.550
Sit down.

52:40.750 --> 52:42.030
Wanko soba?

52:43.790 --> 52:45.030
Hey.

52:46.110 --> 52:48.669
Sure.

52:48.670 --> 52:49.829
Yeah.

52:49.830 --> 52:51.270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:53.030 --> 52:54.869
Mmm. That's good.

52:54.870 --> 52:56.789
They're quite plain, aren't they?

52:56.790 --> 52:57.990
Mm-hm.

53:01.990 --> 53:05.629
It's customary to keep eating - eat
as many bowls as you can, you know?

53:05.630 --> 53:09.509
- Is it? - And the record is held by
this little skinny Japanese girl.

53:09.510 --> 53:12.109
- She ate 700 bowls. - 700 bowls?

53:12.110 --> 53:14.869
- A little skinny Japanese girl.
- Well, it's not a competition, is it?

53:14.870 --> 53:16.709
We'll have a couple
and then we'll move on.

53:16.710 --> 53:18.670
I mean, it really isn't
a competition, is it?

53:41.070 --> 53:43.029
Oh, OK... I'm...

53:43.030 --> 53:44.390
I'm full.

53:46.590 --> 53:49.229
- It was good though, right?
- That is fantastic.

53:49.230 --> 53:51.389
And... And...
I know it wasn't a competition,

53:51.390 --> 53:52.949
but if it was, I, you know...

53:52.950 --> 53:54.949
- Yeah, you would have won.
- I would have won, yeah.

53:54.950 --> 53:57.310
Thank you.
Oh, look at that.

53:58.710 --> 54:03.829
OK. "We forgot to mention, we only
sorted the shipping for one car.

54:03.830 --> 54:07.669
"The transport leaves in one hour
from the airport in Enbu.

54:07.670 --> 54:11.149
"Please decide between yourselves
which car you're taking back
to the UK."

54:11.150 --> 54:12.949
Oh, well, obviously you'd take the
RX-7.

54:12.950 --> 54:16.989
It's a beautiful example, a special
car, rotary engine, not many left.

54:16.990 --> 54:18.269
But they're a dime a dozen.

54:18.270 --> 54:20.629
- What do you mean a dime a dozen?
- They're all over the place.

54:20.630 --> 54:23.189
- A GTT... - You don't see anywhere.
- You do! - I've never seen one.

54:23.190 --> 54:25.029
It's the cockroach of Japanese cars.

54:25.030 --> 54:27.349
- They're everywhere.
- Why would we take the RX-7?

54:27.350 --> 54:31.109
- Quite right, we're taking the RX-7.
- Oh, you'll want some of that.
Look at that over there.

54:31.110 --> 54:32.670
Oi!

54:34.710 --> 54:37.229
With only one car heading back
to the UK...

54:37.230 --> 54:39.309
Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't.

54:39.310 --> 54:41.749
..and just an hour to reach the
airport,

54:41.750 --> 54:44.909
we each had our own take on how to
get there first.

54:44.910 --> 54:47.389
I don't know what Chris's plan is to
get there, but my plan,

54:47.390 --> 54:49.029
I'm going to head to the highway,

54:49.030 --> 54:51.509
stay off these windy roads and then
let it rip.

54:51.510 --> 54:55.869
He's got a march on me,
the little swine.

54:55.870 --> 54:58.349
I'm going to save time.
I'm going the windy route.

54:58.350 --> 55:00.750
I've got an RX-7 - why wouldn't I go
the windy route?

55:02.510 --> 55:06.269
With our destination at Enbu
just 20 miles to the north,

55:06.270 --> 55:09.349
my highway route might have been
slightly further,

55:09.350 --> 55:11.070
but it was definitely faster.

55:12.110 --> 55:13.830
The race was on.

55:16.390 --> 55:19.469
Right, so I've got more power and,
frankly, a better car,

55:19.470 --> 55:23.309
so I should be able to carry more
speed, especially since I'm taking
the highway.

55:23.310 --> 55:26.029
I should be able to get there
quicker.

55:26.030 --> 55:27.150
And I'm home free.

55:31.150 --> 55:33.749
I still reckon
I've got the faster car.

55:33.750 --> 55:36.390
I still reckon this
is the RX-7's to lose.

55:38.470 --> 55:40.549
And, frankly, the odds were with me,

55:40.550 --> 55:44.029
because for Matt to take advantage
of his superfast highway...

55:44.030 --> 55:45.789
Hi, can you open the gate?

55:45.790 --> 55:47.629
Open the gate, please?

55:47.630 --> 55:50.669
First, he'd have to get on it.

55:50.670 --> 55:54.789
Who? Who? No, I just need you to
open the gate so I can get
on the highway. Highway?

55:54.790 --> 55:57.229
Highway. Kado, kado.

55:57.230 --> 55:59.829
No, I'm not going to Chicago.

55:59.830 --> 56:01.549
The gate, the gate, the gate!

56:01.550 --> 56:02.950
You need to open the gate.

56:04.230 --> 56:06.869
Just open it.
There must be a button.

56:06.870 --> 56:08.669
Are you kidding?

56:08.670 --> 56:10.469
Buddy!

56:10.470 --> 56:12.429
This was a setback.

56:12.430 --> 56:17.229
And annoyingly, pocket rocket
Harris was flying.

56:17.230 --> 56:21.149
There is so much to love
about this car.

56:21.150 --> 56:23.189
That rotary engine is so light,

56:23.190 --> 56:26.549
it means the front of the car
doesn't have too much weight so it
doesn't understeer,

56:26.550 --> 56:28.910
it doesn't push,
it just grips and goes.

56:30.390 --> 56:33.870
It is the perfect weapon in which
to beat Matt LeBlanc.

56:37.230 --> 56:38.550
Open the gate!

56:40.190 --> 56:42.469
- No, no. - No, no, what?

56:42.470 --> 56:44.030
How do I get in?

56:46.030 --> 56:47.989
- ETC? - Yeah.
- I have the ETC.

56:47.990 --> 56:51.309
Yeah, I have it. I have it
somewhere. I don't know where it is.

56:51.310 --> 56:53.629
Yeah, I have it. I don't know.

56:53.630 --> 56:54.869
Yeah, the ETC.

56:54.870 --> 56:56.909
What's an ETC? I don't know what
that means.

56:56.910 --> 56:59.789
But while I was still negotiating
hard with the keeper

56:59.790 --> 57:01.309
of the plastic gate...

57:01.310 --> 57:02.669
Come on!

57:02.670 --> 57:07.229
Thankfully, Chris soon discovered
that local roads means local
traffic.

57:07.230 --> 57:08.789
Get out of the way.

57:08.790 --> 57:10.269
Come on!

57:10.270 --> 57:11.630
And while he was held up...

57:12.710 --> 57:15.509
Here we go. Open road, open road.

57:15.510 --> 57:18.349
I had finally overcome
my language barrier.

57:18.350 --> 57:22.029
I have no idea what that guy was
talking about but, hoo, boy,

57:22.030 --> 57:23.910
was he angry.

57:25.790 --> 57:27.549
Move!

57:27.550 --> 57:30.669
Yes. The Skyline and I were in the
hunt.

57:30.670 --> 57:32.309
I love this car, I really do.

57:32.310 --> 57:36.669
It's really grown on me. I've got to
win this and get it back to the UK.

57:36.670 --> 57:38.030
Come on!

57:39.750 --> 57:43.189
With less than ten miles to go to
reach the airport finish,

57:43.190 --> 57:46.269
the gap to Harris was closing fast.

57:46.270 --> 57:48.309
And as I left the highway behind...

57:48.310 --> 57:50.430
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

57:51.550 --> 57:54.789
..it would be a straight sprint up a
private road to reach the waiting

57:54.790 --> 57:58.709
transport and, for one of us,
victory.

57:58.710 --> 58:01.790
This is GTT territory, my friend.

58:07.350 --> 58:11.110
There is no way LeBlanc is going to
get here before me. No way!

58:13.910 --> 58:15.989
There's no way he'd beat me here.

58:15.990 --> 58:17.430
No way!

58:24.390 --> 58:26.589
All right, come on, come on.

58:26.590 --> 58:29.990
Right, got to be getting near the
top now.

58:35.110 --> 58:37.589
Oh, he's there already!

58:37.590 --> 58:40.430
Oh, man!

58:41.590 --> 58:43.550
That sucks.

58:44.990 --> 58:48.109
- How did you get here so fast?
- I had a Mazda RX-7.

58:48.110 --> 58:51.349
- What took you so long?
- I got hung up at a toll booth.

58:51.350 --> 58:54.470
- What's that?
- I got hung up at a tollbooth.

58:55.870 --> 58:57.590
Come on, let's chase him.

59:02.430 --> 59:04.310
Look at him go.

59:08.830 --> 59:10.630
All right, end of the line.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.629
There he goes.

59:15.630 --> 59:17.029
How did you beat me?

59:17.030 --> 59:18.469
I mean, how did you...

59:18.470 --> 59:20.469
What is that? What are you doing?

59:20.470 --> 59:23.029
It's Ichiban.
Lipstick for men.

59:23.030 --> 59:25.630
You need a little more
on the side there.

59:29.190 --> 59:31.230
You're an asshole.

59:35.790 --> 59:38.269
That was mega.
That was awesome.

59:38.270 --> 59:40.069
Awesome, awesome.

59:40.070 --> 59:41.949
That was a hell of a trip.

59:41.950 --> 59:43.869
Japan, great country.

59:43.870 --> 59:45.629
Weird as hell, but great.

59:45.630 --> 59:48.109
You know what really blew my mind?

59:48.110 --> 59:49.629
The toilets, am I right?

59:49.630 --> 59:51.229
- Oh! - Back me up. - They were amazing.

59:51.230 --> 59:54.989
Heated seat and that little probe
thing that comes out and washes...

59:54.990 --> 59:58.029
- Let's not use the word "probe".
- Oh, come on. - No, no, no.

59:58.030 --> 01:00:02.310
Let's call it a telescoping
wash nozzle thing.

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:06.909
- It cleans you. - No, no, can we
get back to the point of the film
here, right?

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:09.309
- OK. - Which was to make money on a
Japanese sports car.

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:11.429
Let's do the maths on this.
You paid, what,

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:12.949
Seven grand at auction, right?

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:15.069
- Right. - OK, and then there was the
cost of flights.

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.669
- What's that, a grand?
- Little bit more.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:19.269
- And then the cost of shipping
the car? - Yeah, don't forget fuel.

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:20.989
Then there was that night at the
sake bar.

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.589
- That was a great night.
- That was mega.

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:24.069
So let's cut to the chase on this.

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:29.069
How much would you have to sell this
car for to break even?

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:30.430
About 52 grand.

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:35.669
But... But I've had a couple of very
strong nibbles, Rory.

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:37.669
- Yeah? - And I'm hopeful.

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:39.149
What's your highest bid so far?

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:40.549
- 800 quid. - 800 quid?

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:43.069
Yeah, but I'm going to squeeze a bit
more out of him. It's fine.

01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:45.589
It's not exactly the strongest
business model, is it?

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.310
Now, look, look, in Chris'
defence...

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:51.789
No, I've got nothing.
I'm sorry, no, no.

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:54.029
OK, look, that's all we've got time
for this week.

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:56.790
See you next week. Goodnight.
