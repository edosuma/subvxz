01:42.978 --> 01:44.063
Oy!

01:44.104 --> 01:45.856
We got a flyer.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.861
- Hello.
- Hello.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.161
I'm sorry about yesterday.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.668
What are you hiding, Philo?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.462
Hiding?

03:31.503 --> 03:33.672
Have you ever let
anyone love you?

03:37.051 --> 03:39.178
I see.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.472
What happened?

03:43.599 --> 03:45.225
Did she hurt you?

03:47.978 --> 03:50.606
Did you hurt her?

03:50.648 --> 03:52.232
Good morning.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.112
Mrs. Fyfe, where is breakfast?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.864
It's half 6:00.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.700
- I should be late for work.
- Right away, Mr. Bagstock.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.339
Taking the long way to work
this morning, Berwick?

04:15.381 --> 04:16.798
Sorry, Inspector.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.341
Wanted to catch you early.

04:18.384 --> 04:20.970
We got another one.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.055
- Another one?
- Dead Pix.

04:23.097 --> 04:26.850
Found her this morning on the
South Bank, just off the road.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.355
Get back, you jackals!
Get back! Get back!

04:31.397 --> 04:33.440
Get back! Move away!

04:33.482 --> 04:35.150
What kind of animal...?

04:35.192 --> 04:38.028
Come on, you don't want
to be watching this. Back.

04:40.990 --> 04:42.408
Pull yourself together, mate.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.451
Get back! Move away!

04:48.998 --> 04:51.834
This couldn't have happened
more than a couple of hours ago.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.461
Oh, after Jack
threw himself off a roof?

04:54.503 --> 04:56.255
Did we get the wrong bloke?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.717
This isn't Jack. He targets the
head, and he doesn't gut them.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.511
Copycat, then? A sympathizer?

05:04.555 --> 05:08.225
Whoever it was,
he finished her off in there.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.270
- How do you know?
- Spillway leads to the river.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.897
Blood trail goes this way,
into here.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.901
Send some men into the sewers.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.612
If he went that way,
he could be anywhere by now.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.989
It's only a Pix.

05:22.031 --> 05:23.907
We still need to put
a name to her.

05:23.949 --> 05:27.244
Ladies who found her
said she was Aisling Querelle.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.621
- They knew her?
- She's famous, apparently.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.416
Or was, back in the day.
A singer.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.418
Have Morange take a look at her,

05:34.460 --> 05:37.212
and get her last-known
from records.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.882
Maybe there's something
at her home for us to go on.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.219
- All right!
- Well, I've had enough fun.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.972
Come on!
Now, go and get to work!

05:51.393 --> 05:53.437
There you go, mate.

06:06.658 --> 06:09.328
Push, push.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.081
Aisling Querelle.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.375
Third floor, number 16.

06:27.679 --> 06:31.308
Waste of time, if you ask me.
I don't care if it's procedure.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.185
For a reason.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.854
You never know
what we might find.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.272
Motive.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.274
Suspect.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.944
Well, I doubt the killer would
be dumb enough to hide out here.

06:41.985 --> 06:45.280
Expensive piece of kit
for a Pix.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.618
Ugh! You little...!

07:00.170 --> 07:02.089
Berwick.

07:08.512 --> 07:09.805
Hey, you!

07:09.847 --> 07:12.015
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

07:12.057 --> 07:13.767
And you thought
I wouldn't find a suspect.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.894
Suspect? What's going on?
What's happened?

07:15.936 --> 07:18.480
What's happening is you
murdered Aisling Querelle.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.607
- What?
- Body's not even cold,

07:20.649 --> 07:22.442
and here you are
pilfering her home.

07:22.484 --> 07:26.321
- Murdered?
- Ms. Querelle was found dead this morning.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.949
Oh, no.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.410
Aisling?

07:31.451 --> 07:34.288
How? Who? Who would want
Aisling killed?

07:34.329 --> 07:35.831
That's what I'm trying
to determine,

07:35.873 --> 07:38.750
along with what you might be
doing in her flat.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.920
Well, she was my friend
from years ago.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.339
I only just arrived
in the Burgue this morning.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.633
I need somewhere to shelter.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.677
Aisling wasn't here.
The door was open.

07:48.719 --> 07:51.638
- I let myself in.
- To her closet?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.473
I heard you coming.
I was frightened. I hid.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.270
F-Fike. Fike, what are you
doing down-down here?

07:58.312 --> 08:01.523
Here we go. There, my boy.

08:01.565 --> 08:05.027
Kobolds. Vicious things.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.778
How dare you. He's my star.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.740
You said you were her friend.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.743
Who would want to see
Ms. Querelle come to harm?

08:12.784 --> 08:15.162
I don't know.

08:15.204 --> 08:16.872
We were both performers,
she and I,

08:16.914 --> 08:20.667
but she was the real artist,
an angel.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.837
She was a being
from another world.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.507
Listen.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.854
That's a faerish tune, isn't it?

08:40.895 --> 08:43.148
That was when she was
at the height of her fame

08:43.190 --> 08:46.735
and the toast of Burgue society.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.987
But I knew her first

08:49.029 --> 08:51.698
when she sang at
a little cafe on the Row.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.660
I'd never heard
anything like it.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.622
And soon there were carriages
lined up round the block,

08:58.664 --> 09:01.833
the rich and powerful
clamoring to get in.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.545
She gave a recital
at Finistere Crossing.

09:05.587 --> 09:09.299
Once, even a command performance

09:09.341 --> 09:11.176
at Balefire Hall.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.642
Did she marry?
Are there children to talk to?

09:18.684 --> 09:20.269
Her life was her art,

09:20.310 --> 09:22.354
which is why it hit her so hard

09:22.396 --> 09:25.190
when she fell out of favor.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.317
And, uh, after that,

09:27.359 --> 09:29.861
she became something
of a recluse, I'm afraid to say.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.613
When did you see her last?

09:31.655 --> 09:34.283
Years ago,
sometime in the aughts.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.538
I told you, I have just arrived
back in the Burgue.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.540
I've been away such a long time.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.750
Well, you won't be leaving
anytime soon.

09:43.792 --> 09:47.170
What do you mean?
I'm still a suspect?

09:47.212 --> 09:50.882
- Till I find a better one.
- The police.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.677
You have a dead Pix,
and all you do is file a report

09:53.719 --> 09:56.680
- and forget about her.
- No.

09:56.722 --> 09:59.099
I'll find whoever did this.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.351
You can count on it.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.203
That is the best china,
for special guests.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.788
For visitors from
the professions,

10:21.830 --> 10:24.207
we use the second-best china.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.543
Yes, ma'am.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.971
Am I gonna have to tell
Master Spurnrose and Miss Imogen

10:38.013 --> 10:40.891
about last night?

10:40.932 --> 10:42.309
What?

10:42.351 --> 10:44.561
You think I didn't
notice you sneak out?

10:44.603 --> 10:47.856
I told you I'd be keeping
my eye on you, girl.

10:47.898 --> 10:49.775
Please don't tell, Afissa.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.651
I don't want any trouble.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.612
Are you on the lixer?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.615
- No.
- Tell me the truth, girl.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.617
Nothing like that.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.327
Well, what is it, then?

11:02.371 --> 11:05.916
I found out someone I knew from
Tirnanoc is here in the Burgue.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.919
A lover?

11:08.960 --> 11:11.129
Believe me,
I never want to see

11:11.171 --> 11:14.424
that man's face again
for as long as I live.

11:14.466 --> 11:18.136
Right, you take the tray,
and I'll get the door.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.307
Mr. Wigsby here
to see you, sir, miss.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.934
Ah, good morning, Wigsby.

11:23.975 --> 11:26.937
Morning.
I came as soon as I could.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.355
You wrote of a situation?

11:28.397 --> 11:30.190
I certainly did.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.734
Cheswith House.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.862
There, across the way.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.490
I heard someone
was taking residence.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.492
Not someone. A Puck.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.120
All puffed up in silken finery.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.746
He carries a ridiculous
walking stick

11:44.788 --> 11:46.915
and has a human manservant.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.333
She's not serious.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.544
I laid eyes on him myself.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.045
Needless to say,
it's a situation

11:52.087 --> 11:54.506
that cannot be allowed to stand.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.551
Well, I sympathize with
your distress, Miss Imogen...

11:57.592 --> 11:59.428
assuredly, I do... but...

11:59.469 --> 12:02.514
I know of no law
explicitly banning

12:02.556 --> 12:05.559
- the sale of property.
- It is simply not done.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.061
Assuredly not.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.813
The gossip has been
that Cheswith was

12:09.855 --> 12:11.148
in debt when he died.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.442
Perhaps it's true and his heirs

12:13.483 --> 12:16.194
chose to sell
to the highest bidder.

12:16.236 --> 12:20.031
- Well, to hell with them, then.
- Imogen, please.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.577
Surely, there's something
you can do, Wigsby.

12:23.618 --> 12:27.164
I'm afraid there is no recourse.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.875
Right.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.752
Wigsby, you've been
our solicitor since Father.

12:32.794 --> 12:36.715
- Hmm.
- If you say there's no recourse, there's no recourse.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.509
We'll simply have to do our best
to ignore our new neighbor.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.678
That-that is the spirit, dear.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.930
We'll pretend
he's not even here.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.224
- Would you take some tea?
- Thank you, yes.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.393
How's Mrs. Wigsby these days?

12:48.435 --> 12:52.481
In fine health
and tolerable disposition.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.575
Mr. Breakspear?

13:07.662 --> 13:10.624
Mr. Breakspear, are you decent?

13:10.665 --> 13:13.460
Oh, fuck.

13:13.502 --> 13:15.545
Begging your pardon, sir,
but I really think it best

13:15.587 --> 13:17.881
we get you back home
to Balefire.

13:19.925 --> 13:23.261
- He's not here.
- What?

13:23.303 --> 13:27.140
Little shit ran out on me
last night.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.434
Without paying, I might add.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.020
Wouldn't have left
without these, would he?

13:32.062 --> 13:35.565
Shite.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.788
Abducted?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.957
Where? How?

13:51.998 --> 13:53.792
A house of assignation
on Carnival Row.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.128
I told him to stay off the Row.
I bloody told him!

13:57.170 --> 13:59.941
- What should we do, Winetrout?
- There's nothing to do, Lady Piety,

13:59.965 --> 14:01.883
except wait for a ransom demand.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.885
- Wait?
- Winetrout's right.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.096
To these brigands,
this is a business.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.931
They understand
that if they don't return

14:07.973 --> 14:11.434
the hostages unharmed,
people will stop paying.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.478
The fewer that know of this,
the better.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.939
Longerbane would make
a scandal of it.

14:15.981 --> 14:19.359
- Absalom...
- They won't harm the boy,

14:19.401 --> 14:21.444
not if they get what they want.

14:21.486 --> 14:25.490
And rest assured,
once Jonah's safely home,

14:25.532 --> 14:28.702
we will find who was responsible

14:28.743 --> 14:33.748
and hang them from the tallest
lamp in Argyle Square.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.719
Which one of you is Quill?

14:45.760 --> 14:48.346
Sir, I'd... I'd like to explain.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.932
- I would appreciate that.
- Well, it was raining.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.560
I went across the street
to get out of the wet.

14:53.602 --> 14:56.980
- You see, the horses...
- Who took my son?

14:57.022 --> 14:59.608
I wouldn't know.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.986
Well, you must have
seen something.

15:03.028 --> 15:06.031
Heard something.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.158
Everything seemed normal.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.868
Normal?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.037
I'm sorry, sir.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.539
- I didn't think...
- Obviously, you didn't think!

15:14.581 --> 15:17.000
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
been hiding across the street,

15:17.042 --> 15:19.794
protecting your Critch hide
from the rain

15:19.836 --> 15:22.339
- instead of protecting my son.
- Sorry. Please, sir.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.674
Please, I would do anything
to protect...

15:24.716 --> 15:26.718
Get him out of my sight.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.763
I never want
to see his face again.

15:35.560 --> 15:39.522
On those who
attended the jester's burial,

15:39.564 --> 15:43.068
nary a smile was to be found.

15:43.109 --> 15:47.864
But they swore they heard
a final chuckle

15:47.906 --> 15:51.117
from six feet underground.

16:00.335 --> 16:03.546
Bravo! Bravo!

16:08.176 --> 16:09.886
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

16:09.928 --> 16:12.889
Thank you. Thank you so much.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.308
Most kind. Thank you.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.608
Okay. Well, let's start again.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.610
Cassiopeia, you missed your cue.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.862
Close the curtains,
and let's start again.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.907
- Are those...?
- Kobolds.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.159
My grandmama got me one
when I was a girl.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.161
Horrid little things.

16:35.203 --> 16:38.164
Come along, Vignette.

16:38.206 --> 16:41.751
There they are.
All the usual faces.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.421
Promenading about,
this way and that way,

16:44.462 --> 16:46.423
like so many leaves in the wind.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.219
It looks like it might rain
after all.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.263
Where's my parasol?

16:54.681 --> 16:57.058
Sorry, miss.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.852
You don't know the first thing

16:58.893 --> 17:01.271
about being a lady's maid,
do you?

17:01.312 --> 17:02.814
Run back and fetch it.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.858
Lively, now.

17:14.576 --> 17:17.537
Excuse me. Could I...?

17:17.579 --> 17:21.540
- Excuse me, would you mind if I came...?
- Sorry.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.542
Excuse me.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.253
Allow me.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.298
Oh, thank...

17:30.341 --> 17:32.343
Thank you.

17:48.610 --> 17:53.239
Quite the deluge, isn't it,
Miss Imogen?

17:55.283 --> 17:58.328
You know my name.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.663
I made inquiries.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.583
You left quite the impression
on me the other day.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.795
As did you, most assuredly.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.130
Believe me,

18:09.172 --> 18:12.091
I am quite aware of the reaction

18:12.133 --> 18:16.054
my arrival to the neighborhood
has provoked.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.973
Then perhaps you ought consider
a different address.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.312
But I like it here.

18:25.563 --> 18:28.107
The Crossing is lovely.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.777
As are its residents.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.612
How dare you speak
to me like that.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.448
- Then how should I speak with you?
- Preferably, not at all.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.659
I know what you're about, girl.

18:39.911 --> 18:43.790
I can smell it on you.

18:43.832 --> 18:47.252
You know what's in it,
don't you?

18:47.293 --> 18:52.465
Piss from a Trow bitch in heat.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.426
What do you know?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.387
I know there isn't a man
that can resist,

18:57.428 --> 19:00.056
and I also know
you needn't have bothered.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.220
It was fucking
pouring down with rain.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.638
- Where were you at?
- Yeah, by the coast.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.422
- I was walking out.
- Yeah, I know it. Yeah.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.058
So, this carriage just
overturned on the road, right?

19:26.082 --> 19:27.518
- Yeah?
- And I'm helping this gent get out.

19:27.542 --> 19:28.918
What, he fell out
of the carriage?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.628
Yeah, he got stuck.
His shoe got stuck.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.981
- Right.
- Comes right off his foot.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.506
Only, it's not his foot.

19:33.548 --> 19:34.942
- What are you talking about?
- It's a hoof.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.467
- A hoof? What, like a Puck's?
- Yeah.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.428
- He's a fucking half-blood.
- Bloody hell.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.971
- Hello, Philo.
- You want one, mate?

19:40.013 --> 19:41.198
- No, I'm all right.
- All right.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.449
So, what, you took him in?

19:42.473 --> 19:43.784
Of course I fucking took him in.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.244
You get a year
for that, Cuppins.

19:45.268 --> 19:46.728
'Cause he's trying to pass.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.455
- Right, right.
- Yeah. Trying to pass.

19:48.479 --> 19:50.773
Did they teach you
anything at the academy?

19:50.815 --> 19:52.209
They're getting
cheeky, aren't they?

19:52.233 --> 19:53.401
Fuck.

19:53.443 --> 19:54.903
So, that's today.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.739
- So these, I'll finish with those?
- Yes.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.074
Uh, and learn
how to spell "necessary."

20:00.116 --> 20:02.076
Yes, sir.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.539
Mate.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.169
What is it, Philo?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.587
I've got a coach waiting.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.757
Missus and I are
going on holiday.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.884
My autopsy request was denied.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.637
Coroner's a busy man.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.347
- Good day, Filkins.
- Morning, governor.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.266
I'm not gonna
waste his time on a Pix.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.519
Now, you get these writs done
today, Filkins.

20:28.561 --> 20:32.231
- Will do, governor.
- Sir, with all due respect,

20:32.273 --> 20:36.361
this wasn't some lixer deal
gone wrong.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.072
She was a quiet sort.
She never bothered anyone.

20:39.113 --> 20:43.326
Hey, you brought down
bloody Jack yesterday.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.745
You're the man of the hour.

20:45.787 --> 20:48.039
Now, let Berwick handle this.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.291
Eh?

20:50.333 --> 20:52.210
She was brutalized.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.212
She was torn apart.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.631
Somebody wanted her
more than just dead.

20:56.673 --> 21:00.051
- I want to find out why.
- And I'm not gonna stop you,

21:00.093 --> 21:02.929
but I won't be wasting
the coroner's time, either.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.901
- Where to, Inspector?
- The Row.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.080
Morning, Doc.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.082
Philo.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.292
I've got one for you.
The usual fee?

21:33.334 --> 21:36.254
- When?
- Soon as you can get there.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.007
Give me an hour.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.228
Sewed her up,

21:52.270 --> 21:54.272
put everything back
more or less where it belongs.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.316
More or less? What kind of
doctor were you back in Puyan?

21:57.358 --> 21:59.610
The only doctor you could find
to do an autopsy

21:59.652 --> 22:01.988
on a Critch.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.866
I'd guess she's about 90
from her wing veining.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.702
There's some distension
in her lady bits,

22:07.744 --> 22:09.746
so she at least
had one pregnancy,

22:09.787 --> 22:13.166
and there's some atrophy
in her coracoideus.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.836
Wing muscle. Normal for her age.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.463
Anything else?

22:18.504 --> 22:20.048
No liver.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.301
No liver?

22:23.342 --> 22:26.387
Must have been left behind
in the mess.

22:26.429 --> 22:29.015
Or the killer made off with it.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.768
Why would he do that?

22:31.809 --> 22:34.312
Good question.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.733
Was it a blade or a talon
that killed her?

22:38.775 --> 22:40.985
Hard to say.

22:41.027 --> 22:44.113
Either way, her sternum
was cut straight through.

22:44.155 --> 22:47.116
That takes some strength.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.327
Could a man have done it?

22:49.368 --> 22:51.621
With enough hate in him, aye.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.337
"Enough hate."

23:12.433 --> 23:14.852
- Evening, lads.
- Hello, Sergeant.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.571
Darius.

23:29.492 --> 23:32.245
Hello, Philo.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.958
Sorry I couldn't come sooner.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.129
Work.

23:49.595 --> 23:52.974
You are a mate.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.184
What happened to your face?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.312
Oh, it's nothing.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.022
How was your day, then?

24:01.065 --> 24:03.192
Same old, same old.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.194
Yours?

24:05.236 --> 24:07.947
There was a killing.

24:07.989 --> 24:09.949
On the Row.

24:09.991 --> 24:13.119
Same old, same old.

24:13.161 --> 24:16.581
- This Pix was different, though.
- How so?

24:18.040 --> 24:22.378
She was a singer
back in the day.

24:22.420 --> 24:25.423
She had a voice.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.425
Haunting.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.260
Can't get it out of my head.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.805
Well, there's only one thing
you can do about that, then.

24:32.847 --> 24:34.432
Solve the case.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.894
Get a fucking different song
in your head, mate.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.356
♪ Take the hard way ♪

24:42.398 --> 24:46.819
- Don't.

25:29.904 --> 25:32.782
You know you don't have to
come here every day.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.701
Could've just as easily been me
behind them bars

25:35.743 --> 25:37.662
instead of you.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.795
Tomorrow, then.

25:45.836 --> 25:47.588
Tomorrow.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.477
Can I help you?

26:01.519 --> 26:03.813
Keep up with what you're doing.

26:06.774 --> 26:09.026
Till next Austery.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.988
For that's how long it will
take you to pay off your debts

26:12.029 --> 26:13.906
for your passage here.

26:37.388 --> 26:41.517
What if I told you
there was a quicker way?

26:48.733 --> 26:50.735
Don't. I warn you.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.029
Well, you see here.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.531
Now, I lost everything.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.575
Everything my family ever had.

26:57.616 --> 27:01.829
Now all I have to show for it
is your miserable Critch cunt.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.914
Fuck you!

27:03.956 --> 27:06.876
Shut your mouth,
you little fae whore.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.627
You listen to me.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.552
Ezra?

27:16.594 --> 27:18.262
What's happened?

27:20.598 --> 27:23.184
I-I caught her stealing.

27:23.225 --> 27:27.104
The little thief had her hand
in the incidentals jar.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.151
And she's gone, just like that?

27:32.193 --> 27:33.694
She owes months on her contract.

27:33.736 --> 27:36.989
Even so, we-we can't have
somebody we don't trust

27:37.031 --> 27:39.825
living under our roof, can we?

27:39.867 --> 27:41.619
Well, she's not gonna
get away with it,

27:41.660 --> 27:43.287
I can assure you of that.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.098
First thing tomorrow morning,
we're going straight

27:45.122 --> 27:47.249
to the constabulary
to report her.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.752
She'll end up on a ship
back where she came from,

27:49.794 --> 27:51.796
if I have anything
to say about it.

28:05.726 --> 28:08.854
Well, you don't have to go back.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.564
Let that fop come
looking for you.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.650
I'll show him a "Critch cunt."

28:19.240 --> 28:21.450
Are you sure you're all right?

28:21.492 --> 28:24.662
What? Yes. Sorry.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.455
It's something else, really.

28:26.497 --> 28:29.834
It's just, um...

28:29.875 --> 28:31.877
I found Philo.

28:31.919 --> 28:34.088
I tracked the bastard down.

28:36.507 --> 28:38.717
I didn't hurt him.

28:38.759 --> 28:42.388
I wanted to, but you were right.

28:42.430 --> 28:45.850
I realized I've wasted
my whole life on all that.

28:47.852 --> 28:50.688
It's time for a fresh start.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.399
Well, I like the sound of that.
What you got in mind?

28:56.068 --> 28:58.654
I was wondering if you could
have a word with your boss.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.534
This isn't a plan to piss off
your ex-lover, is it?

29:03.576 --> 29:04.827
No.

29:04.869 --> 29:06.620
- You want to work here?
- I could.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.873
- Vignette, listen...
- Why not?

29:08.914 --> 29:12.626
Working for my own kind.
Making my own money.

29:12.668 --> 29:15.629
Because you're a ghastly fuck.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.967
I'm magnificent, you cow.

29:20.009 --> 29:21.510
Sorry, sorry.

29:21.552 --> 29:22.845
You are.

29:26.056 --> 29:28.517
You are.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.519
Oh, it's just not you, Vini.

29:30.561 --> 29:32.271
It's not you, either.

29:32.313 --> 29:34.106
You're a poet laureate,
for tit's sake.

29:34.148 --> 29:37.026
Yes, but let's be honest,
the poems were mostly about sex.

29:37.067 --> 29:39.195
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.863
This city doesn't care
who you were.

29:40.905 --> 29:43.782
You have to make the best
of the choices you've got.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.451
What choices?

29:45.493 --> 29:47.119
I can't go back
to that fucking house.

29:47.161 --> 29:49.705
You won't let me work here.
What else is there?

29:52.082 --> 29:54.043
I do know a bloke
who knows some people.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.754
What sort of people?

29:56.795 --> 30:00.007
They call themselves
the Black Raven.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.634
They're fae?

30:01.675 --> 30:04.512
Mainly ex-blockade runners
from the Wing Brigade.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.889
Proud faerish-homeland types

30:06.931 --> 30:09.558
without a homeland to fight for,
just fighting to get by.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.018
Get by how?

30:11.060 --> 30:13.395
Any way they can, I suppose.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.940
Running lots, gaming,
contraband,

30:15.981 --> 30:19.902
potshine, lixer.

30:19.944 --> 30:22.029
It'll put you squarely
on the other side of the law

30:22.071 --> 30:23.906
more often than not.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.409
Sounds perfect.

30:27.451 --> 30:31.288
They're meeting tonight.
I'll get you an introduction.

30:49.223 --> 30:51.392
Any word?

30:53.102 --> 30:54.520
Nothing yet.

30:57.982 --> 31:01.527
We ought to have received
a ransom demand by now.

31:01.569 --> 31:03.862
I would have thought so, too.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.907
But there's nothing we can do
but wait.

31:09.285 --> 31:12.329
Well, what if there were?

31:12.371 --> 31:15.040
I ask you to keep an open mind.

31:17.126 --> 31:18.711
Come.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.135
What is this, Piety?

31:26.176 --> 31:30.055
She's the best chance we have
of getting Jonah home safe.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.765
I won't have this witch
in my presence.

31:31.807 --> 31:35.769
This "witch" has advised
my family for generations.

31:35.811 --> 31:39.148
Haruspexy is quackery
and superstition.

31:39.189 --> 31:41.108
- I won't abide it!
- Quackery?

31:41.150 --> 31:44.820
It was she who brought us
together, and well you know it.

31:44.862 --> 31:46.488
My father would never
have agreed

31:46.530 --> 31:48.198
for me to marry a Burguishman

31:48.240 --> 31:50.159
had she not foreseen
that you were destined

31:50.200 --> 31:53.954
for great things,
your son even greater.

31:53.996 --> 31:57.750
Even so, Critch magic is a sin
against the Martyr.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.710
But it works.

31:59.752 --> 32:02.713
Do you want our boy home or not?

32:02.755 --> 32:05.299
More than my life.

32:05.341 --> 32:07.718
Then let her proceed.

32:11.013 --> 32:14.266
A sacrifice is required.

32:14.308 --> 32:18.270
The dearer to the
House Breakspear, the better.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.840
Yes.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.343
Yes, it all makes sense now.

32:49.385 --> 32:52.137
The man who took your son
is known to you.

32:52.179 --> 32:55.099
Known to us?
Are you certain?

32:55.140 --> 32:58.102
It is he who would
stand athwart you,

32:58.143 --> 33:02.064
he who would drive you
from your seat of power.

33:02.106 --> 33:04.441
Ritter Longerbane.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.737
It is he who has your son.

33:18.580 --> 33:21.333
You're Tourmaline's friend?

33:21.375 --> 33:23.252
Vignette Stonemoss.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.381
Eyes open, mouth shut, Vignette.

33:40.477 --> 33:41.937
Tighter.

33:41.979 --> 33:43.814
Snug as a bug.

33:43.856 --> 33:47.067
I heard you got caught
last night.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.027
I'm just trying to understand.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.822
I told you,
I gave them the slip.

33:51.864 --> 33:54.199
They had you coated and cuffed.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.618
How did you give them the slip?

33:57.828 --> 34:00.164
How did you give them the slip?

34:03.250 --> 34:05.043
Maybe you could show me.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.632
Go on, get yourself
out of all that,

34:11.675 --> 34:13.135
like you did last night.

34:13.177 --> 34:14.803
I'm timing you.

34:16.263 --> 34:18.264
- Who's this?
- Tourmaline's friend.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.225
Ah, right. The lady's maid.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.520
- What's your name, girl?
- Vignette.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.398
Vignette, I'm Dahlia.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.317
Hamlyn tells me you spent
some years

34:28.358 --> 34:31.069
getting our countrymen out
of Anoun before coming over.

34:31.110 --> 34:33.030
That's right.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.574
Good on you.
That's righteous work, that.

34:35.616 --> 34:38.659
Didn't spend quite so long
lady's maiding, though, did you?

34:38.702 --> 34:40.954
Wasn't for me.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.206
Hmm. Me, neither.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.001
This is one of my old
wing corsets, in fact.

34:46.043 --> 34:47.728
You've probably had to wear
something like it.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.087
Do you know why?

34:49.129 --> 34:51.089
They didn't want me to fly off.

34:51.130 --> 34:54.009
Uh, no, it's more than that.

34:54.051 --> 34:56.637
It's envy.

34:56.678 --> 35:00.224
You see, Vignette,
a bird isn't afraid of falling.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.309
No, we're free.

35:02.351 --> 35:05.521
The leggers can't stand
to see it.

35:05.562 --> 35:07.189
So they have to cripple us.

35:07.231 --> 35:09.566
They have to make us like them.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.361
Weak. Heavy.

35:12.402 --> 35:14.571
Afraid of falling.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.993
What really happened
last night, Wren?

35:23.330 --> 35:24.706
Time's up.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.093
The police have been looking
for a foothold

35:36.134 --> 35:38.428
in my organization
for some time.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.473
So, when one of mine spends
a night in police custody

35:41.515 --> 35:44.560
that she won't say shit about,
what am I to do?

35:44.601 --> 35:46.061
Have to protect my own.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.774
The way I see it,

35:50.816 --> 35:53.694
a faerishyn who picks
the groundlings over us

35:53.735 --> 35:56.029
belongs to the ground.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.949
Now, if you have a problem with
that, you should turn and go.

36:02.244 --> 36:05.914
No. I'm done with them.

36:05.956 --> 36:08.166
I won't work for none
but my own kind.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.128
Good.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.006
It's customary that I task you
to prove yourself.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.551
Just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

36:17.593 --> 36:21.680
I want you to take the flag
that's hanging in the rotunda

36:21.722 --> 36:24.099
of the constabulary,
and bring it back to me.

36:24.141 --> 36:27.060
In plain view
of all those bluejackets?

36:28.270 --> 36:31.106
Do you know what we do here?

36:31.148 --> 36:33.567
We get things where
they need to be.

36:33.609 --> 36:36.153
If you're going to be one of us,
I need to know

36:36.194 --> 36:39.573
there isn't a shred of this city
you can't touch.

36:39.615 --> 36:42.534
So, what's it to be, girl?

36:58.675 --> 37:02.304
V-I-G-N-E-T-T-E, Vignette.

37:02.346 --> 37:03.931
Stonemoss.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.016
That's stone, as in stone,
and moss, as in moss.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.517
Right, right, right, right.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.062
You'll need to fill out
a writ of noncompliance,

37:10.103 --> 37:11.331
and then we can issue
an arrest warrant.

37:11.355 --> 37:12.314
Thank you, sir.

37:12.356 --> 37:13.649
Very well, but do hurry up.

37:13.690 --> 37:14.959
She's been missing for 12 hours.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.985
Running all the way, ma'am.

37:20.739 --> 37:21.990
What was that about?

37:22.032 --> 37:23.742
Oh, some Pix broke her contract.

37:44.096 --> 37:45.722
The gentleman
from the constabulary.

37:45.764 --> 37:49.059
Good morning, sir.
Mm, take a seat, please.

37:52.896 --> 37:55.732
You have news... has the
little thief been found?

37:55.774 --> 37:58.694
No.

37:58.735 --> 38:02.572
Though I am here
about the writ you filed.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.783
How much is the contract
in question worth?

38:04.825 --> 38:06.827
It's 50 guilders, sir.

38:06.868 --> 38:09.079
- I would settle it.
- 50 guilders?

38:09.121 --> 38:10.831
On a policeman's salary?

38:10.872 --> 38:13.291
Why in heaven's name would you
waste that kind of money?

38:13.333 --> 38:14.936
Will you release the writ
and give her her freedom

38:14.960 --> 38:16.003
if I pay what's owed?

38:16.044 --> 38:18.588
- Yes.
- No.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.340
- Yes.
- Ezra.

38:20.382 --> 38:21.800
Whatever's got into you?

38:21.842 --> 38:24.219
Imogen, I will explain
in a moment, please.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.462
One last thing.

38:58.503 --> 39:00.714
The girl's no thief.

39:00.756 --> 39:02.382
Why did she run?

39:07.637 --> 39:09.723
I thought so.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.602
I'll show myself out.

39:17.731 --> 39:19.608
I don't understand.

39:19.649 --> 39:23.528
Father left us 10,000 a year,

39:23.570 --> 39:26.740
and now you're telling me
you squandered it?

39:26.782 --> 39:30.285
Do you have any idea how much
it takes to support a household?

39:30.327 --> 39:33.455
Do you? A-Any at all?

39:33.497 --> 39:37.292
So we have coal delivered
by the cartload,

39:37.334 --> 39:39.377
fresh flowers every day,

39:39.419 --> 39:41.671
and that is to say nothing
about what it costs

39:41.713 --> 39:43.298
to keep you
in the latest fashion.

39:43.340 --> 39:46.468
You would lay the blame
for this debacle on me?

39:46.510 --> 39:49.471
I am merely trying to make you
understand I had no choice

39:49.513 --> 39:52.349
but to try and take the
resources that Father left us

39:52.390 --> 39:54.392
and grow them
to reflect our needs.

39:54.434 --> 39:58.480
I trusted that you had
our financial matters in hand.

39:58.522 --> 40:00.482
And I do.

40:00.524 --> 40:03.652
Now, I will right
this situation.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.278
I-I aim to procure a loan

40:05.320 --> 40:07.197
to fund the refurbishment
of another ship.

40:07.239 --> 40:09.032
Oh, by the Martyr,

40:09.074 --> 40:11.326
did you learn nothing
from what happened?

40:11.368 --> 40:13.328
It was bad luck.

40:13.370 --> 40:15.497
A storm.

40:15.539 --> 40:17.791
There is money to be made
in this business still.

40:17.833 --> 40:20.168
- Of that, I'm certain.
- And what is it

40:20.210 --> 40:23.505
that you intend to offer
the bank as collateral

40:23.547 --> 40:26.007
for this loan
you hope to procure?

40:26.049 --> 40:28.176
Why, the house, of course.

40:28.218 --> 40:31.763
No, Ezra, this house
is all we have.

40:31.805 --> 40:33.390
We'll be on the street.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.351
I aim to adjust our fate.
You must have faith.

40:36.393 --> 40:39.479
Oh, faith be damned.

40:39.521 --> 40:42.482
It is my fate, too,
and I will have a say in it.

40:42.524 --> 40:45.610
And what do you know
of anything?

40:45.652 --> 40:47.863
Apart from what to wear
to which function?

40:47.904 --> 40:49.906
Who's been seen with whom?

40:49.948 --> 40:51.992
Now, I am the master here.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.369
I will make the decisions!

41:11.011 --> 41:13.388
Wh-Who's... who's there?

41:13.430 --> 41:15.807
Please.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.851
Answer me.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.413
Do you have any
fucking idea who I am?

41:38.455 --> 41:40.165
I'm Jonah Breakspear!

41:40.207 --> 41:42.375
My father will
crush you for this.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.669
You're dead!
The lot of you, dead!

41:47.505 --> 41:50.008
You did well.

41:50.050 --> 41:52.594
My husband's convinced that it
was Longerbane who took Jonah.

41:52.636 --> 41:57.390
Piety, I've served your family
for many years.

41:57.432 --> 42:00.977
Never before
have I been asked to lie.

42:02.270 --> 42:05.482
Well, there's always
a first time.

42:05.523 --> 42:08.151
Besides, I've always hated
that fucking bear.

42:20.038 --> 42:23.416
There he is,
that ridiculous Puck.

42:24.876 --> 42:28.588
Preening for passersby,
desperate for attention.

42:28.630 --> 42:32.217
Does he really think his money
can buy him acceptance here?

42:54.739 --> 42:57.993
Dear Mr. Agreus:

42:58.034 --> 43:00.161
My behavior yesterday
was unneighborly.

43:00.203 --> 43:02.789
You're welcome to call on me
at your earliest pleasure.

43:02.831 --> 43:05.834
Sincerely, Imogen Spurnrose.

43:08.336 --> 43:10.297
Afissa.

43:19.764 --> 43:22.434
Don't just stand there.
What did he say?

43:22.475 --> 43:25.770
That he would be pleased
to take tea with you tomorrow.

43:29.941 --> 43:31.735
Of course he is.

43:31.776 --> 43:34.404
- Unless there's anything else, miss?
- Uh-uh.

43:43.371 --> 43:45.248
Everything appears
to be in order.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.877
So the writ has been released?

43:48.918 --> 43:50.920
She's free to do as she pleases.

43:53.089 --> 43:54.632
Thank you.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.265
- Inspector.
- What?

44:02.307 --> 44:04.684
We have a problem upstairs.

44:06.936 --> 44:09.147
She's asking to see
the dead Pix.

44:11.358 --> 44:13.485
I only need
a few moments with her.

44:13.526 --> 44:15.528
It's all right, Berwick.

44:17.238 --> 44:19.282
You're a Mima.

44:19.324 --> 44:21.743
- What order are you with?
- Revanscleer.

44:21.785 --> 44:25.830
The investigation
is ongoing, Mima.

44:25.872 --> 44:28.083
The body is evidence.

44:28.124 --> 44:31.211
She was a person first,
and she cannot rest like this,

44:31.252 --> 44:33.213
not after what happened.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.507
She must be anointed.

44:35.548 --> 44:37.550
Please.

44:43.390 --> 44:45.183
In love we begin,

44:45.225 --> 44:48.186
to light we return.

44:48.228 --> 44:51.815
Love begets love
and light begets light.

44:51.856 --> 44:55.777
We are one with all that is

44:55.819 --> 44:58.029
and ever will be.

45:00.949 --> 45:03.910
How well did you know Aisling?

45:03.952 --> 45:07.455
She lit a candle
at my shrine every week.

45:07.497 --> 45:10.750
For who, I couldn't say.

45:10.792 --> 45:14.212
Can you think of anyone
who would've wished her harm?

45:15.755 --> 45:17.966
A pall hangs over her.

45:21.845 --> 45:25.598
She was taken by a great evil.

45:25.640 --> 45:28.059
Hard to see.

45:29.477 --> 45:31.980
But sense...

45:32.021 --> 45:35.733
something unnatural.

45:35.775 --> 45:38.403
Neither man nor fae.

45:46.786 --> 45:48.830
You don't seem surprised.

45:50.623 --> 45:53.126
I've heard my fair share lately.

45:53.168 --> 45:55.837
I met a man just the other night

45:55.879 --> 45:58.089
who claimed he saw
some "dark god"

45:58.131 --> 46:00.091
lurking beneath the city.

46:00.133 --> 46:04.053
- And you didn't believe him.
- He was mad, down to his death.

46:04.095 --> 46:05.805
The old ways can summon things

46:05.847 --> 46:09.809
that would drive a man mad
to look upon.

46:09.851 --> 46:11.811
You're saying magic did this?

46:11.853 --> 46:14.272
Magic is just your word
for all the things

46:14.314 --> 46:16.566
you and yours
haven't yet discovered.

46:16.608 --> 46:18.818
And I'd remind you
there was a time,

46:18.860 --> 46:21.404
not so long ago
in the scheme of things,

46:21.446 --> 46:24.824
when my species was among them.

46:24.866 --> 46:27.076
Thank you, Inspector.

46:54.312 --> 46:57.524
If anything goes wrong, just go.
Promise me.

47:14.874 --> 47:18.461
Oy! Is someone gonna
talk to me or not?

47:18.503 --> 47:20.296
- Shut up and wait your turn.
- Ah!

47:20.338 --> 47:23.633
I was robbed!
Does no one care?

47:23.675 --> 47:25.677
I said shut up.

47:25.718 --> 47:27.470
It only happened
around the corner.

47:27.512 --> 47:29.847
You could still catch 'em
if you move your fat arse.

47:29.889 --> 47:31.325
- Yeah, you tell him, Pix.
- What? What'd you say?

47:31.349 --> 47:32.475
Hey!

47:35.103 --> 47:36.771
Hey, hey,
where do you think you are?

47:45.697 --> 47:46.698
Bloody hell!

47:50.118 --> 47:51.869
- I've got her.
- Don't be daft, man.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.997
If you miss, you'll bring down
the whole bloody dome!

47:58.042 --> 48:00.086
- After her, lads! Come on!
- Go!

48:00.128 --> 48:01.921
- Get her!
- Right away, sir!

48:12.015 --> 48:13.224
Get back here!

48:13.266 --> 48:15.226
Hey!

48:15.268 --> 48:16.811
Stop! Get back here!

48:24.360 --> 48:25.570
I got it.

48:25.612 --> 48:27.155
Get that bloody Critch!

48:29.574 --> 48:31.492
Vignette.

48:32.744 --> 48:35.580
The Raven.
I know you know better.

48:35.622 --> 48:38.374
- What do you care? Give it to me.
- Go.

48:38.416 --> 48:40.251
- Not without that flag.
- They'll arrest you.

48:40.293 --> 48:42.837
And just think of all the things
I could tell them.

48:45.423 --> 48:48.176
They don't know, do they?

48:48.217 --> 48:49.969
They don't know
the truth about you.

48:50.011 --> 48:52.055
Are you threatening me?

48:52.096 --> 48:54.390
Maybe.

48:54.432 --> 48:56.392
Or maybe it's mercy.

48:56.434 --> 48:58.811
You'd never.

48:58.853 --> 49:00.813
You'd never tell them.

49:00.855 --> 49:03.691
Do you really want
to take that chance?
