WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.296
Previously on 90210...

00:06.841 --> 00:10.010
Why'd you do that?
You helped me out tonight,
and I wanted to help you.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.346
It was actually harder to
track down than I expected.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.347
Is this a threat?

00:13.472 --> 00:14.306
You want to get
back together?

00:14.431 --> 00:15.641
No.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.685
SILVER:
I like you
a lot, and

00:17.810 --> 00:19.645
I want to trust you,
but I don't.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.062
What do we do now?

00:23.357 --> 00:24.859
I think it's time
for me to see my birth mom.

00:24.984 --> 00:25.609
DEBBIE:
Dixon, who's there?

00:25.734 --> 00:27.152
Hi. I'm Dana.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.196
I'm Dixon's birth mom.

00:30.405 --> 00:34.618
♪ ♪

01:00.227 --> 01:02.771
DEBBIE:
Harry, this, uh, Dana Bowen.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.647
I-I'm sorry. I should
have called.
No, no.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.191
D-Don't be silly.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.568
We're... We're really
glad that you're here.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.444
Really, really glad.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.699
So, uh, would you
like to have a seat?

01:13.824 --> 01:15.158
Thank you.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.913
Thanks. Well, see,
it's just that, uh,

01:19.038 --> 01:20.873
Dixon e-mailed me,
and, uh, he said

01:20.998 --> 01:22.917
he wanted to come
to Phoenix for a visit.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.793
And I kept trying
to write back, and...

01:24.919 --> 01:26.962
Look, I-I must have started
a dozen e-mails.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.130
And-And then I thought
maybe I should call.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.591
But the truth

01:30.716 --> 01:32.259
was, everything I wanted

01:32.384 --> 01:34.302
to say just seemed better
in person, so

01:34.428 --> 01:36.137
I jumped in
the car, and,

01:36.263 --> 01:37.222
well, here I am.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.099
Way better than a phone call.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.270
(door closes)

01:43.395 --> 01:44.688
Hey.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.398
Hi, Annie.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.358
Hi. Dana.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.821
What are you
doing here?

01:52.947 --> 01:54.531
You-You two know
each other?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.283
Um...

01:56.408 --> 01:58.368
(clears throat)
Uh...

01:58.493 --> 01:59.745
(laughs)

01:59.870 --> 02:02.163
Uh, yeah.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.499
Um... last year,

02:04.625 --> 02:07.210
we headed down to
Phoenix for spring break

02:07.335 --> 02:08.628
when we were supposed
to be at Grandma's.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.505
You what?
What?

02:10.631 --> 02:13.092
Look, I'm sorry.
I had no idea you didn't know.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.427
DIXON:
No-No, look, we didn't tell
you because we didn't want you

02:15.552 --> 02:17.554
to be upset.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.766
Look, when we got to Phoenix,
I couldn't even do it.

02:20.891 --> 02:24.352
I-I couldn't even
get out of the car.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.229
I wasn't ready, I guess.

02:27.815 --> 02:31.485
But now I am,
and here you are, and...

02:31.610 --> 02:32.903
(laughs)
This is great.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.738
(laughs)

02:37.032 --> 02:39.118
But look, I am sorry to intrude.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.953
Um, I passed a hotel
on the way here,

02:41.078 --> 02:42.370
so I'm gonna stay
there, and...

02:42.496 --> 02:43.789
No, no, no, no, no.
You can stay here with us.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.206
Right, Mom?
Right, Dad?

02:45.332 --> 02:47.208
Absolutely.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.418
Absolutely.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.882
Uh... yeah.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.384
We would love that.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.138
TEDDY:
So, are you the
kind of vegetarian

02:59.262 --> 03:00.681
that will occasionally
eat Kobe beef?

03:00.806 --> 03:02.557
Not so much.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.767
Hmm. Rack of lamb.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.811
It's okay if we
can't share a meal.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.521
Come on, we have to share.

03:07.646 --> 03:08.563
I mean, that is
the whole point

03:08.689 --> 03:09.690
of being in a
relationship, right?

03:09.815 --> 03:10.983
You get to
try two dishes

03:11.108 --> 03:12.526
when you go out
to restaurants.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.652
Yeah, that is the whole point.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.403
Mmm.
(laughs)

03:15.529 --> 03:17.614
Teddy.
Hey, Teddy.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.911
Of course if you dated them,
you could try three dishes.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.329
(clears throat)
Two is plenty.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.123
Hmm.
You pick.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.375
Anything but the
vegetable medley.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.669
Hmm.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.296
(ringtone plays)

03:36.842 --> 03:38.760
Sorry about that.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.595
This girl programmed
it in, and...

03:40.721 --> 03:41.889
No. Yeah. I-I get it.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.434
So, what can I get
for you two?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.686
Um...

03:47.811 --> 03:49.521
Teddy!
(laughs)

03:49.646 --> 03:50.689
Hey!

03:50.814 --> 03:51.899
Hey.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.651
Chloe, remember?

03:54.776 --> 03:56.277
I do.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.404
Long time, no see.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.947
Yeah. It's-It's nice to see you.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.951
So, do you know
what you want?

04:03.077 --> 04:05.954
Yeah. Uh, I think
I'll have the vegetable medley.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.457
(laughter)

04:09.583 --> 04:10.709
Okay, everybody,
dig in.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.544
Oh, um,

04:12.669 --> 04:14.588
actually, would you mind
if we say grace?

04:14.713 --> 04:16.339
Of course.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.757
That would...
That would be great.

04:17.882 --> 04:18.966
Who wants to...?

04:19.093 --> 04:20.427
I will.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.930
Great. Uh, terrific.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.474
For what we are about
to receive,

04:26.600 --> 04:29.686
may the Lord make us
truly thankful,

04:29.811 --> 04:32.564
and may we always be mindful
of the needs of others.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.399
Amen.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.734
OTHERS:
Amen.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.694
Wow.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.655
Haven't said that in a while,
but it just came right back.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.783
Think we must have said it
every night, huh?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.826
Most nights.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.745
(laughs)
Would you pass
the salad, please?

04:46.870 --> 04:48.830
Oh, sure.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.458
DIXON:
You know, I don't
have a lot of memories

04:51.583 --> 04:53.961
of when I lived with you,
but you know,

04:54.086 --> 04:56.922
sometimes it just comes back
out of the blue.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.133
Like, when I eat tacos,

04:59.258 --> 05:01.384
I remember
that we had tacos a lot.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.975
So, what made you guys decide
to move to Beverly Hills?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.812
Oh, well, actually,
Harry grew up here.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.647
Oh, no kidding.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.232
(chuckles)

05:15.356 --> 05:17.358
Yeah, you know,
when we finally moved here,

05:17.484 --> 05:19.820
it was like a huge
culture shock all around.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.362
ANNIE:
Stop. You had, like,

05:21.488 --> 05:22.864
no adjustment problems.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.616
He had no adjustment problems.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.660
I mean, he's on the surf team.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.496
I mean, hey,
what can I say?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.081
I'm a natural athlete.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.750
(laughter)

05:40.007 --> 05:42.259
Hey, um, when I used
to play Little League,

05:42.383 --> 05:44.011
we almost won the pennant,
remember?

05:44.136 --> 05:45.637
Mm.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.222
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.780
(knocking at door)

06:03.905 --> 06:05.907
Come in.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.537
Hey, boss, what you up to?

06:10.662 --> 06:12.706
Watching anti-drug PSAs.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.542
Principal Wilson is making me
produce one for the Blaze.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.752
Ooh, fun.
Yeah, no kidding.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.005
I swear, I am going
stir-crazy at home.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.840
Can't wait
to get back to school.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.550
Yeah, I wouldn't say that
too loud,

06:23.675 --> 06:25.426
unless you want
to be called a geek.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.512
By who?
Me... geek.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.596
(laughs)

06:28.722 --> 06:29.764
That the latest edition

06:29.890 --> 06:30.974
of the Blaze?

06:31.099 --> 06:33.392
Yeah. Um...
(clears throat)

06:35.354 --> 06:38.106
It sort of features
Naomi's first segment.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.733
What? What...?

06:39.858 --> 06:40.942
What do you mean?

06:41.068 --> 06:42.027
Who-Who gave her the segment?

06:42.152 --> 06:43.570
I left you in charge.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.072
Look, I have classes,
dude, okay?

06:45.197 --> 06:47.615
I can't squat in the media lab
and guard all the equipment.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.617
No, I-I didn't say
you had to squat. Is it awful?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.995
No.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.788
It's worse than awful.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.414
It's worse.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.296
All right, West Bevers,
it's time

07:01.420 --> 07:03.882
for your about-to-be favorite
new segment

07:04.007 --> 07:05.384
brought to you by me.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.969
So you know it's gonna be
extra hot and spicy.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.888
Blind item.

07:10.013 --> 07:13.474
What senior lacrosse star
was seen hooking up

07:13.600 --> 07:15.018
with a not-so-virginal
cheerleader

07:15.143 --> 07:16.477
outside Health class Monday?

07:16.603 --> 07:19.647
Hint: His initials are M.T.,
and hers--

07:19.773 --> 07:21.482
(whispers)
Erin Graybridge.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.734
Oh, yeah.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.653
Let me tell you, they were
definitely getting busy.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.531
Lust is not really an issue
for me, people,

07:28.656 --> 07:30.075
but in public-- uh-uh.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.785
Get a room. Ugh!

07:31.910 --> 07:35.914
Speaking of disgusting,
what former reform student

07:36.039 --> 07:39.626
likes to stick more up his nose
than you care to know about?
Okay.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.086
Uh, how-how long is this crap?

07:41.211 --> 07:43.171
About seven minutes.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.714
Yeah. We got
to put a stop to this.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.675
Yeah.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.761
News flash! Teddy Montgomery
is a major player.

07:49.886 --> 07:50.971
SILVER:
Was

07:51.096 --> 07:53.014
a major player.
He's not anymore.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.016
Why are you so upset?

07:55.142 --> 07:58.645
'Cause there were
these big-boobed bimbos all up

07:58.770 --> 07:59.980
in my face all night.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.357
Are you asking me if
you should get implants?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.609
Because if you are, I
think that is a great...

08:04.734 --> 08:05.693
big no-no.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.694
I'm not getting implants.

08:06.820 --> 08:07.862
Agreed.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.075
Then what are
you going to do?

08:12.200 --> 08:13.743
(sighs)

08:13.868 --> 08:15.162
Nothing.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.621
I just have to get comfortable

08:16.746 --> 08:18.581
with the fact
that Teddy has a past.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.083
'Cause that's all that it is.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.378
It's-It's his past,
and... and I can deal with that.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.340
Well, you're a lot stronger than
I am. I mean, if I were dating

08:26.465 --> 08:28.091
him, I'd be constantly
wondering, "When is he gonna

08:28.216 --> 08:30.802
cheat on me? When is he gonna
cheat on me? When is he...?"

08:30.927 --> 08:33.221
Naomi!
No, you're right.
There's no need to worry.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.056
You just have to be sensible,
that's all.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.183
So check his e-mail,

08:36.308 --> 08:37.225
monitor his
cell phone

08:37.351 --> 08:39.269
and follow him occasionally.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.313
You know, the usual.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.542
(lighter clicking)

09:30.737 --> 09:33.156
It wasn't that bad.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.326
Worst... dinner... ever.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.495
(sighs)
Every time I'd say something,

09:38.619 --> 09:42.165
every time I tried to connect,
she changed the subject.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.585
This was a mistake.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.295
I don't even know what I was
thinking, wanting to see her.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.713
Come on, don't say that.

09:48.838 --> 09:49.923
It's true, though.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.674
I mean,
we're basically strangers.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.760
I don't even know
what to call her.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.762
Mom? Dana?

09:55.887 --> 09:57.264
Woman-who-gave-birth-to-me

09:57.389 --> 09:58.848
and-doesn't-want-to-talk-to-me
at-dinner?

09:58.973 --> 10:00.183
Well, that one seems
a little long.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.061
I'm serious.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.354
I know.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.980
Uh, well, look,

10:06.106 --> 10:07.232
maybe tonight
didn't go well

10:07.357 --> 10:08.775
because there was
too much pressure.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.610
You know? With
all of us there?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.946
But if you spend some
time alone with her...

10:13.071 --> 10:14.114
In awkward silence?

10:14.239 --> 10:15.532
It'll get better.

10:15.656 --> 10:19.160
Come on, you have to at
least give it another try.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.288
I mean, you've waited
too long not to.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.042
(sighs)

10:26.167 --> 10:27.835
Hmm...

10:31.214 --> 10:33.800
That comment about
saying grace...

10:33.925 --> 10:36.219
you don't think
she was judging us?

10:36.344 --> 10:37.804
I don't.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.764
Okay.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.392
Not that I would blame her
if she was judging.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.227
I mean, we aren't exactly
coming off

10:44.352 --> 10:45.562
as the world's
greatest parents.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.397
We had no idea
that our son and daughter

10:47.522 --> 10:49.357
drove to Phoenix
for spring break.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.067
I know. I know.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.111
Why didn't Dixon just tell us
that he wanted to see her?

10:53.236 --> 10:54.904
I don't know.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.239
He probably thought
we'd be threatened or something,

10:56.364 --> 10:57.407
which is crazy.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.159
Yeah, of course.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.827
So we just need
to make sure

11:00.952 --> 11:02.496
he knows we're comfortable
with this,

11:02.621 --> 11:05.039
with having her here
as a part of our lives.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.083
Absolutely.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.668
You're right.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.671
We will make sure that he knows
we're comfortable.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.181
Nothing like
early morning waves.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.433
You were on fire
out there, my man.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.767
Yeah, I guess
that's what happens

11:24.892 --> 11:26.144
when you have girls
fighting over you.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.188
Helps the mojo.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.856
Did Naomi really
bite Ivy?

11:29.981 --> 11:31.690
Whoa, whoa.

11:33.818 --> 11:37.738
Uh... guys... where
the hell is my car?

11:50.502 --> 11:52.170
ADRIANNA:
Oh, my God!

11:52.295 --> 11:54.214

12:21.199 --> 12:23.577
You have an amazing voice.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.704
So, just so you know, I have
no place to be after school.

12:25.828 --> 12:26.996
So, if you have stuff
at the Blaze

12:27.121 --> 12:28.039
that you need to deal with,

12:28.164 --> 12:30.041
I could just wait
for you there.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.669
Come on, you are so transparent.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.379
You clearly want
to go to the Blaze

12:34.504 --> 12:35.880
'cause you want
to bump into Navid.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.756
(scoffs)
That is so not true.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.343
Okay, that's totally true.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.511
But, I mean, can you blame me?

12:41.636 --> 12:43.263
I mean, the boy

12:43.388 --> 12:46.015
almost got expelled... for me.

12:46.140 --> 12:49.310
What are you talking about?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.354
Come on, Ade, spill.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.481
You cannot tell anybody.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.528
Okay, so I talked
to Navid,

12:58.653 --> 13:00.697
and he said he bought the coke

13:00.821 --> 13:02.449
and planted it
in Jasper's locker.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.451
And then Jasper
somehow found out,

13:04.576 --> 13:06.119
and planted it
in Navid's locker.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.786
He was going
after Jasper

13:07.912 --> 13:10.123
because he knew Jasper
was dealing me drugs.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.459
He was doing it for me.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.087
He was always
like that.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.464
How could I have
thrown that away?

13:19.340 --> 13:23.094
And how the hell am I supposed
to get over a guy like that?

13:23.219 --> 13:25.096
You will.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.974
When you meet someone else.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.517
That's what happened to me.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.270
Um, excuse me?

13:32.395 --> 13:34.230
You like somebody and
you haven't told me?

13:38.192 --> 13:39.068
(laughs)

13:44.532 --> 13:46.409
Dude, I can't believe
someone stole your car.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.994
That is so messed up.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.245
Maybe they'll find it.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.747
Yeah, right.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.291
Please tell my parents
not to hold their breath.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.376
Lemme get a bagel?

13:56.461 --> 13:57.587
Onion, my favorite.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.964
Dude, how did you know?

14:00.089 --> 14:01.174
Hey, hey, the prodigal
son returns.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.635
What's up?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.345
You know, I still don't get how
being suspended from school

14:05.470 --> 14:08.682
is a punishment-- sounds
more like a vacation.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.141
You ever face disappointed
Persian parents?

14:10.266 --> 14:11.601
My own mother said
that I urinated

14:11.726 --> 14:13.394
on the legacy of my ancestors.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.355
(whistles)
Harsh.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.023
And very specific.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.150
Yeah, I'm just glad
to be back, man.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.943
Especially since I can't destroy
Jasper's life from home.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.614
Yeah, it might be time for
you to let that go, buddy.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.866
What, are you kidding me?

14:26.991 --> 14:29.619
Well, the last plan
didn't exactly go so well.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.621
Yeah, well, the next one will.
He needs to go down.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.040
The guy got Ade
back on drugs.

14:34.165 --> 14:37.043
Oh. So that's what
this is about.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.252
Adrianna.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.713
No, dude, it's
about a lot of things.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.214
The guy pushed me
down the stairs.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.757
But that's not
what you said.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.884
You said he got Ade
back on drugs.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.386
Are-Are you a lawyer now?
What's your point?

14:46.511 --> 14:48.304
My point is,

14:48.429 --> 14:51.182
maybe this is less about Jasper

14:51.307 --> 14:53.017
and more about the feelings
you still have for Adrianna.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.019
Come on, dude,
that's ridiculous.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.229
I've clearly moved on.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.647
All right.
Really?

14:57.772 --> 14:59.190
Because it's been a few months

14:59.315 --> 15:00.734
and you haven't so much
as looked at another girl.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.402
Dude, I've looked
at plenty of girls.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.529
In fact, my cousin
came over the other night

15:04.654 --> 15:05.572
and I couldn't help
noticing

15:05.697 --> 15:07.365
that she had suddenly
become very womanly.

15:07.490 --> 15:08.700
If you know what I mean.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.412
What?
Well, okay,
the point is,

15:12.537 --> 15:13.538
I'm over Ade, okay?

15:13.663 --> 15:15.081
I'm-I'm totally
ready to date.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.501
I am. I'm even gonna ask
someone out very shortly.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.503
Sounds good.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.504
Just not your cousin.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.922
(snickers)

15:35.560 --> 15:38.772
Uh, I'm sorry, are you
copying off of me?

15:38.897 --> 15:41.190
I thought we were
study partners.

15:41.315 --> 15:45.069
Oh, so what am I getting
out of this partnership?

15:49.824 --> 15:51.659
That.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.494
Copy away.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.955

17:58.661 --> 18:01.455
"The Glorious Steinems are
looking for a lead vocalist."

18:01.581 --> 18:03.374
That's good to know.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.625
You've heard of
them, right?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.335
They're rad.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.837
They go to West Bev, but
they're like a real band.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.422
They play all over L.A.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.674
The lead guitarist's dad
was in Guns N' Roses,

18:11.799 --> 18:13.718
so they get serious
exposure.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.636
And... you want
to go see a show?

18:15.762 --> 18:16.763
Once you're singing with them.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.639
Me?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.349
Come on, you've got
the most amazing voice.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.351
And you need something
to get your mind off Navid.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.062
Gia, you're sweet.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.230
And, yeah, I do have
to get over Navid.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.482
But joining a band?

18:28.608 --> 18:29.901
That's just not going to work.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.321
My son's birthmother
has come

19:15.446 --> 19:17.364
to stay with us for
a little while.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.699
Wow.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.076
How's that going?

19:20.200 --> 19:23.121
I think it's hard for him,
you know?

19:23.245 --> 19:26.457
He hasn't seen her since
he was eight years old.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.459
There are obviously a
lot of expectations.

19:28.584 --> 19:29.961
No, Deb.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.754
I meant, how's it
going for you?

19:31.879 --> 19:33.422
Me?
Yeah.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.715
Oh...

19:34.841 --> 19:36.592
Oh, I'm-I'm fine.
Yeah, no...

19:36.717 --> 19:39.428
I just... I just want to
make sure that he knows

19:39.553 --> 19:42.181
that I'm not threatened,
so he feels comfortable.

19:43.474 --> 19:44.892
But is it true?

19:45.018 --> 19:47.687
I mean, I imagine

19:47.812 --> 19:50.272
it would feel threatening,
having her there.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.733
(sighs)

19:52.859 --> 19:54.527
Yes.

19:54.652 --> 19:55.862
It does.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.866
But that's not fair.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.951
I need to focus on my son.

20:02.076 --> 20:05.830
Look, I know you're dealing
with a complicated situation.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.374
But I just want you to know
that everything you're feeling,

20:08.499 --> 20:10.209
it's valid, Deb.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.172
Thanks.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.008
(grunts)
I mean, we've barely
begun dating,

20:17.133 --> 20:18.843
and he's already
cheating on me.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.845
At least I-I
think he is.
Maybe he isn't.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.723
Do you think he is?
No, don't answer that.
You have no idea.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.933
Yeah, that's what I was gonna
say-- I have no idea.
Oh, come on!

20:26.059 --> 20:27.935
Don't be naive, Naomi.
He-- okay.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.437
This girl programmed
his ringtone

20:30.563 --> 20:32.190
to be "I Want
Your Sex."

20:32.356 --> 20:33.941
Why else would he be
meeting up with her?

20:34.067 --> 20:35.484
Maybe he won't go.
(sighs)

20:35.609 --> 20:37.028
You think he's gonna
stand her up?

20:37.153 --> 20:38.905
I don't know, Sil.
Me, either.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.907
(sighs)
I just--

20:41.032 --> 20:42.616
I wish that I could
un-see the e-mail.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.284
There's nothing
that I can do.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.828
I mean, I can't exactly talk
to him about it,

20:45.953 --> 20:46.996
because then he'll know
that I spied.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.455
Well, you didn't actually spy.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.916
Spying would be going
to the coffee shop

20:50.041 --> 20:51.250
to see if he shows up.
(gasps)

20:51.375 --> 20:53.086
You should go to the coffee shop
and see if he shows up.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.837
Yeah, right. What, just
say it's a coincidence?

20:54.962 --> 20:57.548
No, don't let him see you.
If he sees you he won't do

20:57.673 --> 21:00.218
whatever it is he might or might
not be planning on doing.
Yeah, you're right.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.928
Maybe I'll just bring out
my fake curly moustache.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.763
No, unfortunately,
that won't work.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.849
Just send someone
he doesn't know.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.851
(gasps)
Okay, maybe.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.853

Oh, no, you're not late.
Um, I'm early.

Uh, you know, I'm always early,
you know.

Uh, not a very good one.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.963
Well, you look great.
How's that?

24:24.088 --> 24:26.632
Better than "not wormlike."

24:26.757 --> 24:27.758
Okay. (laughs)

24:27.883 --> 24:29.885
Let's go.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.887
Oh, ladies first.

24:37.684 --> 24:38.476
Thank you.

24:49.947 --> 24:52.116
You're not having a stroke,
are you?

24:52.241 --> 24:53.575
No, no, no, I'm
not having a stroke.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.244
Uh, are forearms rude?

24:55.369 --> 24:56.578
I can't remember.

24:56.703 --> 24:57.913
I know that elbows
are rude.

24:58.038 --> 25:00.333
Forearms are fine.
And I say that
with authority

25:00.458 --> 25:02.668
because my mother
actually forced me
to go to cotillion

25:02.793 --> 25:05.004
when I was
in fourth grade.
Are you kidding?

25:05.129 --> 25:06.630
I had to do that, too.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.341
Yeah, it was a colossal waste
of time.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.092
Yeah, right up there
with learning

25:10.217 --> 25:11.344
the quadratic equation.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.387
Yeah, right, and I mean
does a ten-year-old

25:13.511 --> 25:14.972
really need to know
how to foxtrot?

25:15.097 --> 25:16.890
Ugh! The foxtrot.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.017
Remember that?

25:18.142 --> 25:20.060
"Slow, quick-quick,
slow, quick-quick."

25:20.186 --> 25:21.937
"Rock left
and promenade."

25:22.062 --> 25:24.064
Yeah, and I was always stepping
on my partner's foot.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.025
She was this funny
little tomboy

25:26.150 --> 25:28.277
who was always wearing, like,
this sailor suit-style dress.

25:28.402 --> 25:29.695
She's probably
in the Navy now.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.031
That is, if she can
still walk. Poor thing.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.574
Whenever we had to go
left, I went right.
You went right.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.328
And you didn't so much

25:37.453 --> 25:41.707
as step on my foot
as stomp on my foot.

25:41.832 --> 25:42.249
That was you?

25:42.375 --> 25:44.293
That was me.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.003
But I'm not in the Navy.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.214
Uh, no, no, you're not.

25:48.339 --> 25:49.840
Wow!

25:49.965 --> 25:52.134
That-That... that's...
that's weird.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.135
No kidding.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.552

25:54.678 --> 25:59.808

this is our second date.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.727
Yeah.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.897
Oh, thanks.

26:05.022 --> 26:06.815
Yeah, it is.

Thank you.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.217
So, what's the score?

26:33.342 --> 26:35.177
You into sports?

26:35.302 --> 26:37.054
Celtics-Pistons.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.098
I mean, it don't get much
better than that.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.641
No kidding?
(chuckles)

26:41.767 --> 26:43.977
Plus I got a few bones
riding on the game.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.104
You gamble?

26:45.229 --> 26:46.439
It's just a little
bit online.

26:46.564 --> 26:49.358
It just makes the games
a little more exciting.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.153
You don't approve?

26:53.279 --> 26:55.781
No, no, it's not that.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.824
Just surprised, that's all.

26:57.950 --> 26:58.951
Yeah, well,

26:59.076 --> 27:00.494
just getting to know
each other, right?

27:03.163 --> 27:05.082
Do you want
to get to know me?

27:05.207 --> 27:07.625
Dixon, of course.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.045
I mean, why else
would I be here?

27:10.170 --> 27:12.172
I don't know. It's...

27:13.799 --> 27:16.427
It's just
that last night was weird.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.305
I kept trying
to say something,

27:19.430 --> 27:22.475
and you kept changing
the subject.

27:22.600 --> 27:27.396
Yeah. Well, you kept
bringing up the past.

27:27.521 --> 27:29.106
Was it stuff
you didn't remember?

27:29.231 --> 27:30.524
Are you kidding?

27:30.648 --> 27:33.986
I remember everything.
Everything.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.821
The tacos you like.

27:35.946 --> 27:38.407
We ate 'em for
89 days straight once,

27:38.532 --> 27:42.035
for breakfast, lunch
and dinner.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.331
I was having a manic episode,
and I made my kid eat tacos

27:45.456 --> 27:47.583
for 89 days straight.
And I'm sitting there
with the Wilsons

27:47.707 --> 27:52.045
in their fancy home
with their home-cooked food,

27:52.171 --> 27:54.714
and I just didn't
want them

27:54.840 --> 27:57.134
to hear about
89 days of tacos.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.511
Didn't want them

27:58.636 --> 28:01.305
to think I was a worse mom
than they already do.

28:01.430 --> 28:04.016
Aw, they don't think
you're a bad mom.

28:04.141 --> 28:07.603
Come on. How could they not?

28:07.727 --> 28:09.480
They knew you couldn't handle
the kid,

28:09.605 --> 28:12.774
so you gave me up
to people who could.

28:12.899 --> 28:17.321
Honestly, I think
they're pretty grateful.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.287
'Cause you know, I...
I am quite the prize.

28:25.412 --> 28:29.041
(chuckles)

28:29.166 --> 28:30.459
Why would you say that?

28:30.584 --> 28:32.710
What do you mean,
I'm a bad dater?
I'm just saying.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.880
Okay, on our first date
you stomped on my foot.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.340
On our second date
you not only implied

28:36.465 --> 28:37.591
that I'm wormlike,

28:37.715 --> 28:39.092
but you also
insinuated that I have

28:39.218 --> 28:40.135
the fashion sense
of a sailor.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.303
I'm sorry.

28:41.428 --> 28:42.846
That dress was lovely.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.557
Too little too late.
(laughs)

28:44.682 --> 28:45.974
Okay, you know what?
You're right,

28:46.099 --> 28:47.560
sort of.

28:47.685 --> 28:50.354
Uh, I'm just terrible with
first and second dates, okay?

28:50.479 --> 28:52.022
But the third...
(laughs)

28:52.147 --> 28:53.482
...the third is when
I come alive.

28:53.607 --> 28:54.858
How do you ever get

28:54.983 --> 28:56.026
to the third date?

28:56.151 --> 28:57.319
I rarely do.

28:57.444 --> 29:01.365
But if you'll give me
the chance, well...

29:01.490 --> 29:02.991
prepare to be swept away.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.326
Swept away, huh?

29:04.451 --> 29:05.327
Yeah.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.204
So, what do you say?

29:09.915 --> 29:11.291
Can I tell you something?

29:11.417 --> 29:14.211
Sure.

29:14.336 --> 29:17.631
When you first asked me out,

29:17.756 --> 29:21.468
I thought you were just doing it
to get over Adrianna.

29:21.594 --> 29:24.263
I was.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.515
But that's-that's not why
I'm here now.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.768
I'm here now
because I really like you.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.648
So, will you please give me
another chance

29:34.814 --> 29:36.983
to take you out again
and to not insult you?

29:42.489 --> 29:44.366
And maybe even kiss you?

29:44.491 --> 29:48.370
(chuckles) Okay.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.253
(squealing)

29:56.378 --> 29:58.464
Okay, okay,

If I can guess
your crush,

30:00.591 --> 30:02.468
you have
to tell me, okay?

30:02.593 --> 30:04.219
Yes, and that was
your first question.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.220
Are you serious?

just wasn't expecting...

30:22.195 --> 30:23.363
I know.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.116
What's wrong with me?

30:26.241 --> 30:29.077
I knew that that was gonna
happen at some point.

30:29.202 --> 30:31.330
It's okay to be upset.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.499
Yeah, for how long?

30:33.624 --> 30:35.501
I have to find a way

32:37.623 --> 32:39.666
I feel terrible.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.335
So, you got
a little carried away.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.088
Anyway,

32:45.213 --> 32:46.256
point is, it's over.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.466
You got the answer you wanted.

32:47.591 --> 32:48.884
Can we just put this
behind us, please?

32:49.008 --> 32:50.886
Yeah, she's right.
What's done is done.

32:51.010 --> 32:55.307
I mean, sometimes we mess up
and we just have to move on.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.187
(giggling)

33:04.608 --> 33:05.484
(wastebasket door creaks)

33:05.609 --> 33:07.110
(sighs)

33:07.235 --> 33:08.111
Oh, my God...

33:08.236 --> 33:09.613
Oh, my God, we need
to go right now.

33:09.738 --> 33:12.491
What, what's going on?
Are you okay?
(sighs)

33:13.992 --> 33:16.244
What the hell?
Is he stalking you?

33:16.369 --> 33:18.204
I don't wanna talk about it.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.039
Let's just go.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.676
Maybe I should text Dixon.

33:30.801 --> 33:32.385
I mean, they should've
been home by now.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.429
Yeah, go ahead,
send him a text.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.436
But I shouldn't, right?

33:41.561 --> 33:44.105
I mean, he's with Dana.

33:44.230 --> 33:45.315
I'm sure he's fine.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.442
Yeah, no, I agree,
I'm sure he is.

33:47.567 --> 33:51.530
Yeah, I'll wait.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.114
Give him some space.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.574
(phone ringing)

33:54.700 --> 33:55.701
Oh, maybe that's him.

33:55.826 --> 33:57.661
Yeah... Hello?

33:57.786 --> 34:00.288
Is it Dixon?

34:00.413 --> 34:01.707
Oh, you... you're kidding me.

34:01.832 --> 34:03.082
Harry, is everything okay?

34:03.208 --> 34:03.750
Yeah, it's not Dixon.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.752
Right, okay.

34:05.878 --> 34:08.129
Well, I appreciate the call.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.840
Yeah, thank you.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.384
Well, the police
found the kids' car.

34:12.509 --> 34:13.927
Downtown, completely stripped.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.469
Oh, unbelievable.
(door closes)

34:15.594 --> 34:17.472
(Dixon and Dana laughing)

34:17.597 --> 34:20.475
What?! The Suns challenge
the Lakers for the West?

34:20.600 --> 34:22.018
In your dreams.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.145
I don't need to dream it,
I just need to see it.

34:24.270 --> 34:25.188
Hey, you two.
You have fun?

34:25.313 --> 34:26.356
Yeah, yeah, we did.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.649
Look, I'm sorry to
keep him out so late.

34:27.774 --> 34:28.775
We just lost track of time.

34:28.900 --> 34:29.818
No, that's okay.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.194
We're glad you had fun.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.612
Well, we did.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.447
Anyway, um, I'm beat, guys.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.159
So, good night Mom,
good night, Dad.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.870
Wait, I'll,
uh, I'll walk up with you.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.454
Night, you two.
DEBBIE:
Sleep well.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.498
Huh, see?

34:43.623 --> 34:44.623
It went well.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.668
Yeah.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.920
It looks like it did.

34:49.045 --> 34:52.090
Well, so all this anxiety
was for nothing, right?

34:53.592 --> 34:55.301
(sighing)

34:55.427 --> 34:58.722
You know, everything
I'm feeling is valid, okay?

34:58.847 --> 35:00.640
And it would be nice
if my husband understood that.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.768
(stammers)

35:25.498 --> 35:27.584
(typing)

35:41.807 --> 35:43.850
(school bell ringing)

35:48.897 --> 35:51.316
Hey, hey, look who's here.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.485
Hey, guys.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.820
Adrianna, hi.

35:54.945 --> 35:57.447
So, where's your tambourine?

35:57.572 --> 36:00.659
Oh, I don't have a tambourine.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.328
I told you she didn't, Liv.

36:03.453 --> 36:05.371
Liv hates the tambourine.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.915
Because it's not an instrument.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.168
It's a glorified baby rattle.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.587
Okay, well, I promise you
I do not own a tambourine,

36:12.712 --> 36:14.673
nor will I ever take up
the tambourine.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.549
All right then, we're cool.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.511
Cool.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.640
All right, it's five
past-- where is she?

36:23.765 --> 36:24.808
Dude, would you chill?

36:24.933 --> 36:27.352
I'm here, I'm here.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.896
Yeah, seven
minutes late.

36:30.022 --> 36:33.191
Relax, it's fine.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.651
Adrianna, this is Lila,
our bass player.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.235
Hey.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.364
Hi.

36:44.077 --> 36:45.578
Hey, hey!

36:45.704 --> 36:48.206
So, somebody had
a hot date last night.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.501
Me, I met somebody.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.419
(laughing)

36:53.545 --> 36:55.380
Please tell me it
wasn't your cousin.

36:55.505 --> 36:56.673
Dude, will you get
off that already?

36:56.798 --> 36:57.716
No one thinks it's funny.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.051
Uh, actually I do.

36:59.176 --> 37:00.468
Whatever. Now I don't even
feel like telling you

37:00.593 --> 37:01.761
who I went out on a date with.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.555
You guys just blew it.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.682
All right.
Cool.

37:08.518 --> 37:09.728
Okay, it was Lila.

37:09.853 --> 37:12.939
All right? And... it was cool.

37:13.065 --> 37:15.650
It was really cool.

37:15.775 --> 37:18.277
Cool enough for you to move off
your whole Jasper vendetta?

37:19.571 --> 37:21.865
Yeah, it was, actually.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.076
I mean, whatever,
you could've been right.

37:24.201 --> 37:26.161
I mean, the whole thing,
it could've had

37:26.285 --> 37:27.871
a little something
to do with Ade.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.789
DIXON:
I got a question.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.290
So, who's hotter?

37:31.416 --> 37:33.585
Lila or your cousin?

37:33.710 --> 37:36.588
Dude, will you shut up?

37:36.713 --> 37:39.841
But Lila, definitely Lila.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.760
I cannot believe this.

37:41.885 --> 37:43.678
I joined the band
to get over Navid

37:43.803 --> 37:45.013
and now I have to spend
every day

37:45.138 --> 37:46.472
with the new girl he's dating?

37:46.598 --> 37:47.807
It sucks!
It does.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.893
It really sucks.

37:50.018 --> 37:50.977
How am I gonna do this?

37:51.103 --> 37:52.353
You'll figure it out.

37:52.478 --> 37:53.939
No, I won't, I can't.

37:54.064 --> 37:55.481
Maybe I should just quit.

37:55.607 --> 37:56.649
Are you serious?

37:56.775 --> 37:58.110
Every day I'm gonna be

37:58.235 --> 37:59.736
reminded of Navid
and what I lost.

37:59.861 --> 38:02.114
You know what? That's it.

38:02.239 --> 38:03.489
I cannot hear
about Navid anymore.

38:04.866 --> 38:07.202
Okay.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.621
I'm sorry I've been
going on and on

38:09.746 --> 38:11.706
about him.
That's not the problem.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.666
Then what?

38:14.709 --> 38:16.878
Nothing.

38:17.003 --> 38:20.548
Gia, you can tell me.

38:20.673 --> 38:23.093
What?

38:23.218 --> 38:26.138
Hey, we're friends.
I like you, okay?

38:28.098 --> 38:32.018
The problem is... I like you.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.316
Then my coach was like,

38:38.441 --> 38:39.692
"You're gonna have to
kick it into high gear."

38:39.818 --> 38:41.027
Which is true, I've got a bunch
of tournaments coming up.

38:41.153 --> 38:42.779
You've never
seen me hardcore.

38:42.904 --> 38:44.447
I hope it doesn't
scare you off.
Stop.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.532
What?

38:46.658 --> 38:48.701
I can't... I can't do this.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.662
I'm still gonna have
plenty of time for us, and...

38:50.787 --> 38:52.371
No, look, it's not that.

38:52.497 --> 38:55.625
I... I gotta tell you
something, okay?

38:55.750 --> 38:58.753
Okay.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.968
I read your e-mail.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.678
What?

39:06.803 --> 39:08.763
I did, I...

39:08.888 --> 39:13.018
I opened it up, and I saw that
there was this message from Amy

39:13.143 --> 39:14.853
and that she wanted
to meet you and...

39:14.978 --> 39:17.063
Look, nothing happened.
No, I know that

39:17.189 --> 39:19.983
it didn't, because...

39:20.108 --> 39:21.693
because...

39:21.818 --> 39:26.031
I had my friend Gia
go to the coffee shop, and...

39:26.156 --> 39:28.867
she, like, kind of...
she watched you guys.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.705
Y-You spied on me?

39:33.830 --> 39:35.665
Yeah, yeah, I did.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.334
I'm so sorry, okay? I...

39:37.458 --> 39:40.920
It's just been... it's...
it's been really hard

39:41.046 --> 39:42.380
because of your past.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.174
All these girls that
keep coming up to you.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.012
I was feeling insecure.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.056
And I didn't know
if I could trust you.

39:51.181 --> 39:54.100
But it doesn't
matter, because...

39:54.226 --> 39:57.729
it was wrong.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.105
And I was wrong.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.901
But it's never
gonna happen again.

40:03.026 --> 40:06.779
Because now I know
I can trust you.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.115
That's great, it is.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.078
But the thing is...

40:13.203 --> 40:15.288
now I don't know
if I can trust you.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.624
No, hey...
Look...

40:18.750 --> 40:21.002
I...

40:21.127 --> 40:22.879
I need some space, okay?

40:23.004 --> 40:25.590
Don't... don't do this.

40:34.724 --> 40:37.185
Hey, Annie, you need a ride?

40:37.310 --> 40:39.478
Stop, just stop
stalking me.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.106
I don't know what
you're talking about.

40:41.231 --> 40:44.567
I saw you last night, okay?
And the night before that.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.819
You're really scaring me.
No, look, I'm sorry.

40:48.529 --> 40:49.822
But you don't need
to be afraid of me.

40:49.948 --> 40:50.990
I'm not gonna hurt you.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.034
Okay, I'm just
trying to help.

40:53.159 --> 40:53.993
I don't need your help.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.620
You do, actually.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.414
Who do you think

40:57.538 --> 40:59.291
got rid of the
one piece of evidence

40:59.416 --> 41:01.042
that's linking you
to my uncle's death?

41:01.167 --> 41:02.710
What?

41:02.835 --> 41:03.920
The car.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.217
It was you who stole our car.

41:09.342 --> 41:10.635
Well, what if the police ever

41:10.760 --> 41:12.720
came looking
for physical evidence?

41:12.845 --> 41:15.181
Now there is none, it's gone.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.980
See, I'm just... I'm just
looking out for you.
