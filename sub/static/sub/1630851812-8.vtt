WEBVTT

00:04.963 --> 00:07.674
And next up is Crystal Jarrett.

00:09.551 --> 00:10.844
Come on, Crystal!

00:10.928 --> 00:11.929
Come on!

00:12.012 --> 00:13.639
You got this!

00:18.060 --> 00:19.186
Come on, baby.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.193
"Still I Rise," by Dr. Maya Angelou.

00:26.777 --> 00:28.779
-Yes!
-Jace, sit up.

00:31.448 --> 00:36.453
"You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies…"

00:37.454 --> 00:39.081
You may trod me in the very dirt…

00:39.164 --> 00:45.087
"You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise."

00:45.170 --> 00:46.463
You're doing great, Crystal.

00:48.257 --> 00:52.719
"Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?

00:53.262 --> 00:58.058
Because I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

00:59.518 --> 01:04.897
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,

01:05.482 --> 01:10.153
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise."

01:29.423 --> 01:30.757
Hibachi!

02:13.217 --> 02:17.888
"Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?

02:18.639 --> 02:24.478
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?

02:25.604 --> 02:29.483
Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard

02:30.150 --> 02:35.030
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own backyard.

02:37.491 --> 02:41.787
You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,

02:42.871 --> 02:45.249
You may kill me with your hatefulness,

02:45.332 --> 02:47.584
But still, like air…

02:49.962 --> 02:51.171
I'll rise.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.383
I rise,

02:54.466 --> 02:55.926
I rise,

02:57.094 --> 02:58.387
I rise."

03:02.766 --> 03:05.394
Yes! Good job, Crystal!

03:11.733 --> 03:12.734
Hey, yo, Jace.

03:17.656 --> 03:18.657
What's up?

03:20.325 --> 03:22.870
Damn, what the hell is that smell?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.746
Bro, Phil farted, man.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.874
Come on. Yo, that's foul.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.209
If you wanted more social distance,
you could've said something.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.669
-For real.
-Man, stop trippin'.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.379
Y'all know it smells like
fresh-baked cookies.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.672
-Yo.
-Yo.

03:33.755 --> 03:34.923
You're lying to yourself.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.551
Look, my mom wants me home.
This couldn't wait until tomorrow?

03:37.634 --> 03:38.635
Nah, it couldn't.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.389
I need y'all to know,
y'all aren't just my teammates anymore.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.851
Y'all are my brothers. You feel me?

03:45.934 --> 03:48.145
-For sure.
-No doubt.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.272
Never thought I'd be
in a protest like that.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.443
It was something I'll never forget.

03:55.027 --> 03:58.655
I always thought of myself
as one of y'all.

03:59.615 --> 04:03.493
But when I go back to the suburbs,
I don't have to be.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.537
-No, you're our brother too.
-Hey, that's real.

04:06.330 --> 04:10.042
Yo. Yo, they're scorching us online.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.919
They said, "The players on Swagger DMV are

04:12.002 --> 04:14.838
a disgrace to youth sports
across the nation."

04:15.339 --> 04:19.134
"Last thing we need in this country
are more thugs on a basketball court."

04:19.218 --> 04:21.553
Hey, yo. The Undefeated says,

04:21.637 --> 04:23.680
"We're proud of these young men
for being brave enough

04:23.764 --> 04:25.807
-to continue the conversation."
-Hey.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.352
-That's more like it.
-Text that to me.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.062
I got you, homey. Hold on.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.648
-Me too.
-Hey, yo. J. Cole just reposted it.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.566
-Stop lyin'.
-No way. Lemme see.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.068
-Yo, it's real.
-Stop lyin'.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.444
Bro, it's real.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.654
-No way. What?
-What?

04:38.737 --> 04:40.364
-He's not kidding.
-That's true, yo.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.324
-Yeah, word.
-No ways!

04:42.407 --> 04:44.159
Hey, nah, nah, nah.
Check it out, though.

04:44.243 --> 04:46.745
-Bro, what?
-To all you kings and queens out there,

04:48.163 --> 04:50.749
this is your man Overtime Larry
kicking it with Swagger DMV.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.294
I just want to talk to
my man Jace Carson here.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.796
-Let 'em know.
-Yo, Jace,

04:55.879 --> 04:59.216
when you took a knee at that game,
what the hell were you thinking?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.551
Yeah.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.344
Hope my mom doesn't have a heart attack.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.848
Hey, hey, hey, Nick Mendez.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.685
We all know you was robbed
of that sweet game-winning buzzer beater.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.603
Got any message out there
for all the fans?

05:11.687 --> 05:12.688
Oh, of course.

05:14.273 --> 05:17.609
What doesn't break us, makes us stronger.

05:17.693 --> 05:18.777
Yes.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.821
-That's what I'm talkin' about.
-Straight up.

05:20.904 --> 05:22.322
With that being said,

05:23.073 --> 05:25.576
Coach says if we wanna get to nationals,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.870
we're gonna have to win out
the Fall Ball Tournament.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.292
So if we lose, we're done?

05:33.375 --> 05:34.376
We're done.

05:35.419 --> 05:36.461
Hey, but we got this.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.297
We're stronger than ever, y'all.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.550
If we could survive that last game,
we could survive anything.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.510
That's it. That settles it.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.137
No more losses.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.973
No more losses.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.057
We win out.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.475
Hey, "No more losses" on three.

05:52.394 --> 05:55.022
One, two, three. No more losses!

07:17.729 --> 07:18.814
Miss your daddy?

07:23.235 --> 07:24.444
Miss your daddy?

07:29.533 --> 07:31.535
There you are now, flaring them nostrils.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.496
Maybe you ought to be…

07:35.080 --> 07:39.042
If you want more than your average throne,
can't go wrong here.

07:39.543 --> 07:43.839
This bad boy comes with double jets
to clean efficiently.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.216
I swear to God,
I think we've met before.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.552
I've been employed here for a few years.

07:49.052 --> 07:52.014
Now this is the Tesla of toilets.

07:52.598 --> 07:57.936
It comes with a sensor so that
the lid opens and closes automatically.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.189
I shit you not.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.816
-Sorry, what was that?
-It's a bad joke.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.735
Are you
a Kenilworth Elementary School dad?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.820
My daughter won't be going to school
for a few years.

08:06.904 --> 08:10.157
Fantasy Football Draft,
Smitty's Bar and Grill, right? Nailed it.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.408
Nah, it's not me, man.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.538
Well, I guess you just have
one of those familiar faces.

08:16.622 --> 08:17.915
Especially with the mask.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.335
Well, I will take the Tesla of toilets.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.295
Excellent choice. It's right here.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.880
Wait, wait, wait.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.217
Wasn't it you and your team
that was all over social?

08:28.926 --> 08:31.595
You're Icon, right? Right?

08:32.679 --> 08:35.015
-Yeah.
-I used to watch you play in high school.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.892
Matter of fact,
I was at the Fairfax game

08:36.975 --> 08:39.394
the first time you came out with
two different color sneakers.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.479
You remember that?

08:42.105 --> 08:43.815
It was two different color laces,
actually.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.777
Hey, all I know is that crowd went nuts.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.861
And hey, I gotta tell you.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.739
What happened to you and your team
at that tournament, that wasn't right.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.699
Everyone loves talking about free speech

08:52.783 --> 08:54.785
until they disagree with
something you gotta say.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.869
Yeah. That's right.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.829
Hey, I've been doing
a little coaching nowadays.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.081
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.290
Eight-year-old soccer.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.127
Half the time I'm just trying
to get them to pay attention.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.839
Trust me, that never changes.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.300
You got any tips for me, Coach?

09:12.845 --> 09:14.137
Someone once told me,

09:14.680 --> 09:17.850
"A great coach teaches his kids
to win in life,

09:17.933 --> 09:19.893
on and off the basketball court."

09:19.977 --> 09:21.436
Or soccer field.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.272
I'll remember that.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.899
It's great to see that Icon is back.

09:26.775 --> 09:30.612
Hey, would you mind if we took
like a quick selfie?

09:31.321 --> 09:33.907
I mean, I'm at work.
Plus, the social distancing is…

09:33.991 --> 09:36.326
No, I totally get it. Sorry about that.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.786
I mean…

09:39.496 --> 09:41.915
-Yeah, why not?
-Oh, man. Thank you.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.960
Here we go, and three, two, one.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.963
Hey!

09:51.049 --> 09:55.679
Hey, hey. Y'all keep doin' what you doin'.
I'm proud of y'all…

10:00.058 --> 10:01.560
This your guy Overtime Larry,

10:01.643 --> 10:05.480
taking a break from my pandemic workout
to shout out Swagger DMV.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.900
Yes! Y'all be standing up to this world.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.943
A club team of ninth graders.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.486
The season just started back up

10:11.570 --> 10:13.906
and some of them
made the mistake of eating while Black.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.657
They had the cops called on them.

10:15.741 --> 10:18.535
A couple hours later at their game,
they took a knee during the anthem.

10:18.619 --> 10:22.956
A controversial move,
and social media has been hard at work.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.333
Folks are uplifting them.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.918
Other folks are tryna crush them.

10:26.001 --> 10:29.129
But props to their coach,
Ike "Icon" Edwards.

10:29.213 --> 10:30.881
Some of y'all never heard of the brother.

10:31.507 --> 10:34.259
A straight-up high school legend
from the DMV

10:34.343 --> 10:36.470
who turned out to be
a molder of young men.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.316
But it's not just the fellas
holdin' it down.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.527
Stare or smile at me.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.779
Some brave young women
from the DMV spoke up

10:53.862 --> 10:57.783
and finally got justice from the abuse
they suffered at the hands of their coach.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.994
Maybe there's something in the water,
but the hoopers in the DMV…

11:01.078 --> 11:04.331
-…was the worst.
-…are finding their voice. Respect.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.209
Come on. How you feeling, man?

11:07.292 --> 11:08.710
Morning, Coach.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.963
-Ready to work?
-Yeah.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.048
I like it.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.592
-Yo. You see that?
-Yeah.

11:15.676 --> 11:16.677
What's up?

11:16.760 --> 11:18.554
Y'all ready? Let's go. Let's go.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.389
Close 'em up. Close 'em up. Close 'em up.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.641
Close 'em up.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.561
Close 'em up, Ricky. Go! You gotta move.
You gotta move. You gotta hustle.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.271
There you go. Move, move, move, move.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.273
Stay on 'em. Stay. That's right.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.233
How'd you pull this off?

11:32.568 --> 11:34.194
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.029
That's you. That's you.
Come on. Lock--

11:36.113 --> 11:37.948
There you go. You gotta move.
You gotta move, Rick.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.408
-Nice throw.
-Lester Davis?

11:39.491 --> 11:40.701
Yeah, right.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.287
He'd have his name inscribed
all over that.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.664
-Yeah.
-You gotta stay on him. Keep goin'.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.541
Royale's dad?

11:48.166 --> 11:50.002
-Keep it going. Keep it going.
-Please.

11:50.085 --> 11:53.422
By now, he'd be demanding that Royale
be the focal point of your offense.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.633
-There we go.
-Well.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.136
-There it is.
-Yeah, that's you, Rick.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.637
Basketball Santa Claus.

12:03.891 --> 12:04.975
That's you.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.276
-Funny.
-That's crazy.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.195
Kendrick Lamar just followed me
on Instagram!

12:16.278 --> 12:17.821
-No way.
-You lyin'.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.990
Kendrick Lamar is following me
on Instagram!

12:20.073 --> 12:21.491
Kendrick Lamar!

12:21.575 --> 12:24.119
Kendrick Lamar! Hey, hey, hey.

12:24.203 --> 12:27.122
Be humble, sit down!

12:27.831 --> 12:29.124
Be humble

12:29.208 --> 12:30.667
Sit down

12:30.751 --> 12:31.752
Be hum--

12:33.378 --> 12:35.380
We doing cell phones at practice now, huh?

12:35.464 --> 12:38.467
Nah, Coach.
I just had it in my shorts pocket and--

12:38.550 --> 12:40.093
But y'all having fun? Right?

12:40.177 --> 12:41.887
-Yeah.
-Right? Y'all having fun?

12:41.970 --> 12:44.348
-Yeah.
-Good. I'm glad.

12:45.516 --> 12:46.767
'Cause fun time's over.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.353
What? What did we do?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.897
It's what you're about to do
that I'm fixing.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.733
Believing in your glow-up. It's a trap.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.319
And you need to take it seriously.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.570
We are taking it serious.

12:58.654 --> 13:02.032
Yeah, Coach.
You haven't seen our new "fam" masks?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.159
Come on, man. I know you like it, bruh.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.412
Y'all think we're gonna win now
because y'all got a bunch

13:07.496 --> 13:09.331
of matching family masks?

13:10.332 --> 13:11.792
Who's our next opponent?

13:14.044 --> 13:15.087
-Go-Go Hoops.
-Oh, yeah.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.421
Jace's old team.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.676
And believe me, Coach Harrison

13:20.759 --> 13:24.221
will love nothing more
than to bring us back down to Earth.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.682
Not exactly my biggest fan either.

13:26.765 --> 13:30.143
For the record, Coach.
I was the only good player on that squad.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.229
-He can't stop me or us.
-Right.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.814
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

13:33.897 --> 13:37.067
Harrison has been actively
picking up players.

13:37.818 --> 13:38.819
But you're right.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.614
They can't stop us. You know why?

13:43.866 --> 13:46.493
Because "If there is no enemy within,

13:46.577 --> 13:51.206
the enemy outside can do us no harm."

13:51.957 --> 13:54.209
It's a little African proverb for y'all.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.129
So, we're gonna go in this empty pool,

13:58.839 --> 14:01.717
far away from this shiny new toy in here.

14:02.217 --> 14:05.721
Far away from cell phones and rappers.

14:05.804 --> 14:09.725
We're gonna run laps.
We're gonna do our drills.

14:10.392 --> 14:13.812
And when you're so tired that you
don't feel like you can walk anymore,

14:14.646 --> 14:17.482
we're gonna come back here,
and perform our plays

14:17.566 --> 14:19.193
to absolute perfection.

14:23.989 --> 14:26.325
-We should have known better.
-Why's he doing this?

14:28.702 --> 14:30.329
You goin' in first, big brother.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.667
No way.

14:36.168 --> 14:38.837
-What the hell? You know about this?
-No.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.797
We're about to go crazy.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.759
Santa Claus is getting
on my last damn nerve.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.511
A hell of a gesture, though.

14:45.594 --> 14:48.055
Two, three, four.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.223
Wait.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.605
-What?
-I don't know.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.331
Power to the people.

15:37.396 --> 15:38.814
Maybe you didn't notice

15:38.897 --> 15:40.482
because you're so used
to shooting bricks.

15:40.566 --> 15:41.942
But there is no hoop up there.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.736
Maybe you didn't notice,
but you smell like chlorine.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.573
They filled the pool at the rec,
so we all just jumped in.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.116
Practice gear and all.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.993
I swear, it was hilarious.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.744
Y'all are dumb.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.289
Man, whatever. Come get this.

15:57.291 --> 16:00.544
I asked them to wrap my chicken,
so it doesn't touch the fries.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.462
-Just how you like.
-Thank you.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.009
So, they arrested your coach?

16:07.092 --> 16:08.135
Yeah.

16:09.303 --> 16:10.304
That's good.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.182
Even though it was on Zoom,

16:15.475 --> 16:18.562
it was scary as hell to testify.

16:18.645 --> 16:23.358
Saying everything to a judge
and lawyers was awkward, you know?

16:25.944 --> 16:27.571
How are your parents dealing with it?

16:28.405 --> 16:30.073
I've never seen my dad so mad.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.368
And my mom, she's so scared
to let me out her sight.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.704
But I'm glad I told them.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.497
You know, feels like they have my back.

16:37.581 --> 16:38.582
Me too.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.792
I think I know that already.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.004
I'm gonna start going to therapy.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.716
We got therapy right here.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.511
My parents think it'll be good for me

16:50.594 --> 16:52.429
to talk to someone
who doesn't know me already.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.682
Maybe it'll help.

16:56.892 --> 16:59.603
I hear you. I'm happy for you.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.563
Yeah?

17:05.233 --> 17:08.403
So, are y'all gonna get a new coach?

17:08.987 --> 17:10.030
They are.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.365
They?

17:11.448 --> 17:14.617
The parents of some of my teammates
were pissed that I spoke up.

17:15.577 --> 17:21.415
I also have grown players messaging me
on IG saying how proud they are of me.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.796
I just need a fresh start.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.757
There's just so much going on.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.510
I was thinking…

17:34.429 --> 17:36.014
I don't want things to get weird.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.059
With what?

17:39.142 --> 17:40.143
Us.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.354
Huh?

17:43.647 --> 17:47.901
I mean, every time we say
we're just gonna be friends,

17:47.985 --> 17:50.279
something happens and we kiss again.

17:51.405 --> 17:52.656
Maybe that means something.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.700
Maybe that means we're being stupid.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.703
There's too much going on.

18:00.163 --> 18:03.375
I don't need a boyfriend.
I need a best friend.

18:08.547 --> 18:12.217
Yeah, I mean, I was kinda thinking
the same thing.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.387
Besides, Coach and I are clicking.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.514
Whole team is clicking.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.144
We're trying to win out
to get to nationals.

18:22.227 --> 18:26.523
So, my focus is all on hoops right now.

18:27.649 --> 18:28.650
I feel that.

18:32.613 --> 18:33.614
Teresa.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.616
How often should our kids be tested?

18:35.699 --> 18:37.201
Rapid tests twice a week.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.621
Temperature checks before all games
and practices.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.165
And masks when not on the court.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.458
-Excuse me.
-Eva.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.252
Drew's high school team tryouts
are next week.

18:47.336 --> 18:49.129
What should we do
if there's a scheduling conflict?

18:49.213 --> 18:50.797
Email us ahead of time.

18:51.507 --> 18:54.885
Of course we want the kids to thrive
in their high school seasons,

18:54.968 --> 18:59.806
but the Fall Ball Tournament will be
major exposure for their young careers.

18:59.890 --> 19:02.601
And with them being ninth graders,

19:02.684 --> 19:05.395
college coaches are gonna be
streaming some of their games.

19:05.479 --> 19:06.980
-I have a question.
-Jenna.

19:07.064 --> 19:09.733
Jace can't have another six months
of no games.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.944
So, I'm prone to allow him to play.

19:12.027 --> 19:16.198
But this isn't easy to say,
so I'll just be blunt.

19:16.281 --> 19:19.034
Why didn't you pull our boys
out of that arena

19:19.117 --> 19:21.411
when that crowd was antagonizing them?

19:22.079 --> 19:24.748
They didn't look like they were playing
in front of a basketball crowd.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.875
They looked like they were
in front of a mob.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.628
Yeah. It's true.

19:29.711 --> 19:33.423
I thought it was important
for our players not to back down.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.970
The moment was bigger than the game.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.472
It was life.

19:40.556 --> 19:42.307
Exactly. Their lives.

19:42.391 --> 19:46.353
Hey, just for the record, Jenna,
taking a knee was not planned.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.480
That was something that the kids
did spontaneously,

19:48.564 --> 19:49.898
and we wanted to support them.

19:49.982 --> 19:54.194
I think not being bullied
or chased away was the right thing to do.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.655
But there was no cause
to provoke them either.

19:57.155 --> 20:00.284
An anthem protest
at the Soldier's Tournament?

20:00.367 --> 20:03.036
They weren't--
We weren't protesting the anthem.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.746
You're a new parent, Ike.

20:04.830 --> 20:09.585
You know there is nothing more important
than protecting your child.

20:09.668 --> 20:12.546
But you'll come to understand,
that that doesn't change

20:12.629 --> 20:14.381
when your kid becomes a teenager.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.925
With all due respect, don't tell me
what I don't and do understand.

20:17.009 --> 20:19.720
Okay, okay, okay. You know what?
Let's just take a minute here.

20:19.803 --> 20:24.224
Okay? All right, listen. We are all proud
of how our boys faced this adversity.

20:24.892 --> 20:28.854
But how do we turn that defeat
into a victory for our kids?

20:29.563 --> 20:31.106
That's the focus now.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.192
-Right, Coach?
-Right.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.654
I for one, I am happy
with how the team has come together.

20:37.738 --> 20:39.781
-So am I.
-Yeah. That's true.

20:39.865 --> 20:42.951
Yes, we all can agree
that the kids are amazing.

20:46.747 --> 20:49.333
Well, thank you all.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.627
We'll be in touch.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.964
-Have a good night.
-Thank you.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.471
You're a new parent,
so you don't know nothing.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.556
She really went there?

21:04.640 --> 21:06.975
Who the hell does Jenna Carson
think she is?

21:08.560 --> 21:09.561
Jenna Carson.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.023
-Yeah.
-Drama, Coach?

21:13.899 --> 21:15.859
Just another day in the office, Phil.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.572
Hey, you finish your homework?

21:21.448 --> 21:22.574
Yes.

21:22.658 --> 21:25.077
Let's go pick out that pull-out couch
we've been talking about.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.161
All right.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.085
I love you, Black Queen.

21:36.255 --> 21:37.339
I love you.

21:38.757 --> 21:39.758
Okay.

21:41.927 --> 21:44.638
I need to ask you something, Coach Max.

21:45.222 --> 21:46.682
It's about Ike.

21:46.765 --> 21:49.017
I thought my counsel was beneath you.

21:49.101 --> 21:50.394
Never that.

21:50.477 --> 21:53.397
You're the godfather
of grassroots ball around here.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.731
Appreciate the respect.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.650
What you wanna know, Jenna?

21:57.609 --> 22:00.988
There's some things about Ike
that's not sitting right with me.

22:01.071 --> 22:04.283
Yeah? I got a whole laundry list.

22:04.950 --> 22:06.034
Go on.

22:07.411 --> 22:11.164
His perfect role model persona
is in full effect.

22:12.165 --> 22:16.670
But why would he fall out with
his best friend on his high school team,

22:17.546 --> 22:19.464
and his father who coached him?

22:19.548 --> 22:21.592
His old teammate, Lester,
made it to the pros.

22:21.675 --> 22:25.387
Ike didn't. We all know what that's about.

22:25.470 --> 22:28.015
So, why was he at odds with his father?

22:28.098 --> 22:29.474
Some father-and-son shit.

22:30.684 --> 22:31.935
No one knows.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.562
Somebody knows.

22:33.645 --> 22:35.063
Maybe Lester does?

22:35.147 --> 22:37.900
Would you be willing to see
what you can find out?

22:38.901 --> 22:40.402
We'd be indebted.

22:40.485 --> 22:42.988
If your mama instincts tell you
somethin' not right with the man,

22:43.071 --> 22:44.448
why not just go with that?

22:44.531 --> 22:47.784
Because I need something
more concrete than intuition.

22:48.452 --> 22:50.454
With all this social media hype
on the team,

22:50.537 --> 22:53.207
my son thinks his coach walks on water.

23:01.465 --> 23:02.466
Hey.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.303
Hey.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.478
I got an email from your step team.

23:15.854 --> 23:18.232
Says you're not signed up
for the new season.

23:18.941 --> 23:20.776
-I know.
-Why not?

23:20.859 --> 23:22.402
Because I don't feel like it.

23:24.071 --> 23:25.948
Or maybe you're trying to make a point.

23:26.031 --> 23:27.241
And what point is that, Mom?

23:28.200 --> 23:29.451
That you're a martyr.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.037
Yes. Yeah, that's exactly it.

23:33.789 --> 23:37.209
You don't have to stop doing
something you love because I hurt you.

23:37.292 --> 23:40.671
I apologized for missing your show.
I apologize again.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.464
I don't want any more of your apologies.

23:42.548 --> 23:43.549
That's fine.

23:45.634 --> 23:46.969
I don't need one from you.

23:51.765 --> 23:53.725
I'm not gonna stop selling cosmetics

23:53.809 --> 23:56.353
because you embarrassed me
at my presentation.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.189
I gotta keep doing this.

24:01.191 --> 24:02.985
Jackie, I wanna move us outta here.

24:05.237 --> 24:08.115
And I need to prove that I can.

24:08.615 --> 24:09.783
To myself.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.745
There are so many excuses
that I can hold on to.

24:13.829 --> 24:17.082
I'm a single mom.
I can barely make ends meet.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.668
My daughter wants to get into
a good college.

24:20.669 --> 24:23.172
My son wants to play professional ball.

24:23.255 --> 24:29.720
Any wrong turn or misstep
for both of my kids could ruin everything.

24:30.804 --> 24:33.307
It's so easy to say
that I can't handle the pressure.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.393
Well, how do you?

24:36.476 --> 24:37.561
I pray.

24:40.189 --> 24:45.068
And I try to see past
what's directly in front of me.

24:45.986 --> 24:47.779
Seeing what no one else sees.

24:47.863 --> 24:53.535
And I make sure nothing stops my kids
from shining their lights.

24:54.578 --> 24:55.704
Shining our lights?

24:56.747 --> 24:58.749
Okay, that was a little bit corny, Mom.

24:59.833 --> 25:00.918
But…

25:02.002 --> 25:04.880
But maybe I'll sign up for step again.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.257
I mean, I'll think about it.

25:07.341 --> 25:09.259
You don't have to think about it.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.803
I already signed you up.

25:12.888 --> 25:13.889
'Kay. Thank you.

25:13.972 --> 25:16.058
And it's only corny
if you don't believe it.

25:22.439 --> 25:24.316
Oh, my God. Please stop.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.818
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, I got it.

25:28.237 --> 25:31.949
Tight, tight, tight. Come on. Faster.

25:37.454 --> 25:38.455
Switch!

25:38.539 --> 25:40.249
-Here.
-Come on, Belton. Good.

25:40.332 --> 25:41.333
Come on.

25:41.416 --> 25:43.085
Hey, I can't talk right now.
I got practice.

25:44.086 --> 25:45.629
Get over yourself, bro.

25:45.712 --> 25:48.423
-Yo, over here, over here.
-You gotta make that pass!

25:51.802 --> 25:55.055
Excuse me. I'd like to join Swagger.

25:56.598 --> 25:57.975
Hey, head up! Next!

25:58.058 --> 26:00.394
-You're Crystal Jarrett.
-Yes.

26:00.978 --> 26:02.396
You spoke up against Coach Warrick.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.606
That took a lot of steel.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.191
I don't want to be known for just that.

26:06.275 --> 26:08.777
I'm the number one female two-guard
in the DMV.

26:09.278 --> 26:12.906
My high school team's only practicing,
but I'm tryna play games.

26:12.990 --> 26:16.076
You need to win out the rest
of your season. I can help.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.329
She's not wrong.

26:19.955 --> 26:20.956
About any of it.

26:24.126 --> 26:26.795
I don't doubt that.
But I've already got a full roster.

26:26.879 --> 26:30.174
Plus, I'm not sure the league
will allow a girl to--

26:30.257 --> 26:32.676
-I can handle the league.
-I'll make you a deal, Coach.

26:33.260 --> 26:36.263
I score on five members of your team,
and I'm on.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.931
-Pass! Pass!
-Right here.

26:38.015 --> 26:39.141
Here's my rapid test results.

26:40.934 --> 26:42.769
You feelin' good?
You feelin' from deep.

26:46.315 --> 26:48.192
-All right.
-I can't believe this.

26:48.275 --> 26:49.359
Who's up first?

26:51.987 --> 26:53.280
Man, I got this.

26:53.363 --> 26:56.658
-Word up. All right, Royale.
-All right, Royale.

26:56.742 --> 26:58.410
Hey, hey. Wanna be laughed at?

27:00.454 --> 27:02.331
-Hey, D-up, Royale.
-Come on.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.423
What? Nah.
I ain't even stretch yet, Coach.

27:11.507 --> 27:12.716
Come on.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.092
Who's next?

27:17.054 --> 27:19.306
All right, I'll choose. Drew.

27:19.389 --> 27:21.391
-Yeah, Drew, boy, you gotta go.
-Ain't no way.

27:21.475 --> 27:22.559
This is crazy.

27:26.188 --> 27:28.607
-You've got this. Lock up, man.
-Come on, Drew.

27:31.568 --> 27:32.861
Get down, Drew.

27:32.945 --> 27:34.071
Guard me, stupid.

27:35.030 --> 27:36.990
-D-up, Drew.
-All right. Nothing personal.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.668
That was personal.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.962
Hey, Drew. Let's stand right here, bro.

27:50.045 --> 27:51.463
Just chill with me.

27:52.881 --> 27:54.925
Hey, I'ma do you a favor
and try not to hurt you.

27:55.634 --> 27:56.802
Let's go, big man.

27:56.885 --> 27:58.011
Get her, Phil.

27:58.804 --> 28:00.889
-Yeah, Phil.
-Phil, watch her. Watch her.

28:08.689 --> 28:09.857
My bad.

28:10.399 --> 28:11.525
Very funny.

28:14.570 --> 28:15.571
Yo.

28:16.113 --> 28:17.114
Hey, my turn.

28:19.408 --> 28:22.786
Hey, Nick. Guard up. Guard up, man.

28:25.914 --> 28:28.041
Hey, what's wrong?
You want me to play you like a girl?

28:28.125 --> 28:30.085
-Shoot that.
-She can't make that.

28:35.090 --> 28:36.967
-Did you see that?
-…three.

28:37.050 --> 28:38.051
Good shot.

28:39.052 --> 28:41.513
All right. One more volunteer.

28:43.140 --> 28:44.391
-Who's it gonna be?
-No way.

28:44.474 --> 28:45.976
-Jace.
-You gotta stop this.

28:46.059 --> 28:47.227
What you waiting for?

28:53.525 --> 28:54.985
You should quit while you're ahead.

28:55.527 --> 28:58.530
What, you scared I'm gonna score on you
like I have our entire lives?

28:58.614 --> 29:00.157
Damn!

29:04.786 --> 29:06.663
Let's go, scrub. Check ball.

29:07.164 --> 29:08.373
You got this, Jace.

29:08.874 --> 29:10.167
D-up. D-up, man.

29:11.084 --> 29:12.085
Deck out, man.

29:12.169 --> 29:13.295
You sure you want this?

29:14.213 --> 29:15.214
Easy money.

29:22.054 --> 29:24.223
Shit. I know all your moves.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.558
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

29:26.642 --> 29:29.978
Seen that before.
Seen that before. Seen that before.

29:33.524 --> 29:35.817
Hey! Man, that don't count.

29:35.901 --> 29:37.694
-Hey.
-That's my shit!

29:38.403 --> 29:40.405
Hey, that counts.
That counts. That counts.

29:40.489 --> 29:41.615
Hey, that don't count.

29:41.698 --> 29:44.368
There's only one attempt
in King of the Court. That's the rule.

29:44.451 --> 29:46.787
That wasn't a real attempt. I played you.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.080
You wanna go again?

29:48.163 --> 29:50.415
-You don't wanna go again.
-You know I'll cook you all day.

29:50.499 --> 29:52.042
You don't wanna go again.

29:52.125 --> 29:55.712
-You know you don't wanna go again.
-Water. Water. Water. Water.

29:55.796 --> 29:57.840
Three minutes. Three minutes.

29:58.799 --> 30:00.509
-She cooked you.
-Crystal.

30:00.592 --> 30:02.845
-You can't talk it out, Royale.
-She cooked you.

30:02.928 --> 30:05.013
-No cussing.
-Yes, Coach.

30:07.224 --> 30:10.060
Make sure you give Meg your jersey size
after practice.

30:10.644 --> 30:11.728
Bet.

30:12.396 --> 30:15.899
Bet? That's all you gotta say?
You know you made the team, right?

30:17.484 --> 30:19.319
Congratulations, Coach.

30:23.282 --> 30:24.783
Congratulations, Coach.

30:26.451 --> 30:29.288
Come on now. I knew I was good, but…

30:29.371 --> 30:33.584
-Yo, here she go. Here she go.
-Honestly, I think I might be a legend.

30:33.667 --> 30:36.461
Yeah, a legend that gets to take two shots
in King of the Court.

30:36.545 --> 30:38.630
-Queen… of the Court.
-I don't think so.

30:39.590 --> 30:40.674
For real, though.

30:41.258 --> 30:43.969
I had a lot of days where
I didn't even wanna play anymore.

30:44.553 --> 30:47.139
Felt good to just be out there hoopin'.

30:47.639 --> 30:50.267
I almost let Coach Warrick
take that away from me.

30:51.768 --> 30:53.896
Still just trying to find my way back,
you know?

30:55.063 --> 30:56.106
Yeah.

30:57.065 --> 31:00.235
And now we're teammates. That's crazy.

31:00.903 --> 31:02.279
You know I'm gonna be hard on you?

31:03.197 --> 31:05.324
Please, scrub. I'm gonna be hard on you.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.451
Oh, really?

31:20.297 --> 31:22.549
Maybe we should keep our masks on
from now on.

31:22.633 --> 31:23.634
Good idea.

32:06.301 --> 32:07.302
Hi, Mom.

32:07.970 --> 32:09.221
Hi, honey.

32:09.304 --> 32:13.725
I saw the dude with the ABO League
driving off. He came to talk to you?

32:14.685 --> 32:18.021
Yeah. Coach Max.
He had some information to share.

32:18.647 --> 32:19.648
About what?

32:20.232 --> 32:21.233
Ike.

32:22.109 --> 32:24.736
They shouldn't be mad
about what happened at the tournament.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.865
'Cause to be honest,
I think it made me a better person.

32:27.948 --> 32:29.324
That's a big statement.

32:29.825 --> 32:33.453
Coach challenged me
to pull my team together as a leader,

32:34.121 --> 32:35.122
and I did.

32:35.205 --> 32:37.958
You could've gotten hurt. All of you.

32:39.459 --> 32:42.880
Coach Max told me some things
that aren't quite adding up

32:42.963 --> 32:44.923
to the man that Ike is pretending to be.

32:45.007 --> 32:46.341
Pretending to be?

32:46.884 --> 32:49.469
-Coach Max is a hater.
-Hear me out.

32:50.053 --> 32:52.890
In Ike's senior year,
his team was undefeated.

32:53.390 --> 32:55.225
Then in the final game,

32:55.309 --> 32:58.187
he gets into a falling out
with his best friend, Lester Davis.

32:58.270 --> 32:59.980
He pisses his dad off so much

33:00.063 --> 33:02.816
that he doesn't even go
to his own son's press conference

33:02.900 --> 33:05.235
when he declares for Georgetown
weeks later.

33:05.819 --> 33:06.820
So?

33:06.904 --> 33:09.448
They lost a game
they had no business losing.

33:09.531 --> 33:13.660
Ike scored way below his average.
He had tons of turnovers.

33:13.744 --> 33:16.079
The other team was probably
clamping down on defense.

33:16.163 --> 33:17.831
Coach probably got nervous.

33:17.915 --> 33:21.710
You don't just lose your best friend
and your dad, who is your coach,

33:21.793 --> 33:23.212
because you had a bad game.

33:23.712 --> 33:24.713
What are you tryna say?

33:26.507 --> 33:29.801
Back then, a lot of people in this area

33:29.885 --> 33:32.513
would make bets on high school games.
It was a big deal.

33:33.138 --> 33:36.725
I think Ike tried to lose.

33:36.808 --> 33:37.976
Why would he do that?

33:38.060 --> 33:39.061
Money.

33:40.229 --> 33:43.106
Money over a state championship game?

33:43.190 --> 33:45.234
Mom, do you hear yourself?

33:45.817 --> 33:47.444
Ike-- He would never do that.

33:48.028 --> 33:49.988
-I'm gonna ask him.
-No, Mom, you're not.

33:50.072 --> 33:51.990
-You always do this.
-Do what?

33:52.074 --> 33:54.993
First, you hated on that track coach
I used to have. He wasn't smart enough.

33:55.077 --> 33:58.247
Then, you hated on Coach Harrison
because you thought he was too old-school.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.748
Now, you're hating on Ike

33:59.831 --> 34:03.168
because he had one bad game
his senior year of high school?

34:03.252 --> 34:04.503
Mom, they're not my father.

34:04.586 --> 34:07.089
This is not about your father.
It's about you.

34:07.172 --> 34:09.049
It's always about my father.

34:11.467 --> 34:12.803
You can't even see that.

34:14.847 --> 34:16.348
I have to get
something from the store.

34:44.333 --> 34:49.130
Hey, ya! Hey, ya!

34:49.214 --> 34:50.757
Go, Drew!

34:53.217 --> 34:54.219
Okay.

34:56.513 --> 34:57.723
Show 'em, Jace!

35:05.230 --> 35:06.982
Hold on.

35:07.482 --> 35:09.568
Hey, what's up with your kicks?

35:11.236 --> 35:14.781
-Come on, man. Come on!
-Yo, that ain't gonna work.

35:14.865 --> 35:16.909
Little something I pulled out the vault
for good luck.

35:16.992 --> 35:18.535
Yeah, that's the Icon classic.

35:18.619 --> 35:19.786
I mean, that's dope.

35:21.413 --> 35:22.664
All right. Listen up.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.502
Y'all go out there focused.

35:26.585 --> 35:30.255
We got family members in there.
Tons of people online.

35:30.339 --> 35:34.218
And like it or not,
y'all have become a cause.

35:34.801 --> 35:38.472
People are gonna hate you for that.
And they're gonna love you for it.

35:38.555 --> 35:40.807
They're gonna want you
to stand for many things.

35:41.517 --> 35:44.728
More than anything,
a team stands for each other.

35:45.270 --> 35:46.271
Show up.

35:50.567 --> 35:51.818
And I'm so proud…

35:53.862 --> 35:55.447
to be y'all coach.

35:58.492 --> 36:00.035
Even if y'all can't dance.

36:02.371 --> 36:03.497
Let's go get 'em!

36:41.743 --> 36:42.953
Good luck to you, Coach.

36:43.912 --> 36:45.539
Yeah. You too, Ike.

36:46.498 --> 36:50.502
And if you see any more of my players
you wanna poach, you let me know.

37:04.224 --> 37:05.475
Yo, Earl!

37:05.976 --> 37:07.895
-What's good? How you been?
-Aight.

37:07.978 --> 37:09.229
How long you been with Harrison?

37:09.313 --> 37:10.522
About two weeks.

37:11.356 --> 37:13.650
I heard y'all cut me
for Royale and Crystal.

37:13.734 --> 37:14.735
Are you serious?

37:14.818 --> 37:17.029
Hey, you know we had
nothing to do with that. For real.

37:17.112 --> 37:19.364
-All right, come on.
-I'm just happy to see you. What's up?

37:19.448 --> 37:22.326
Nah, don't get too happy.
I'm really 'bout to bust y'all ass.

37:24.328 --> 37:25.829
All right. Say that.

37:29.166 --> 37:30.709
One, two, three! Fam!

37:32.336 --> 37:33.337
All right.

37:50.979 --> 37:54.900
Get 'em! Get 'em!
There we go! Hands up! Hands up!

37:58.195 --> 37:59.905
-There it is!
-Get it back.

37:59.988 --> 38:01.532
There we go! There we go!

38:04.076 --> 38:05.410
Hey, come on. Give me one.

38:07.371 --> 38:08.539
Close our middle!

38:10.415 --> 38:12.084
All day, baby! All day!

38:14.086 --> 38:15.504
Phil! That's you!

38:25.097 --> 38:26.098
Take it up!

38:27.891 --> 38:28.892
Let's go!

38:29.518 --> 38:31.353
Come on.
Talk to each other. Talk to each other.

38:33.981 --> 38:35.691
Finish it. Let's go!

38:37.651 --> 38:38.735
That's right!

38:39.528 --> 38:40.737
Get back!

38:41.238 --> 38:43.198
Lock him up! He gets nothing!

38:43.282 --> 38:45.701
There we go! There we go!
He gets nothing!

38:47.452 --> 38:49.872
Now, I'm not saying that
you'd be nothing without me.

38:49.955 --> 38:51.540
But I am saying this.

38:51.623 --> 38:55.002
You try and leave this team
and you're gonna be sorry as hell.

38:58.338 --> 39:00.757
Good hands! Good hands! He gets nothing!

39:00.841 --> 39:03.343
-Nothing! That's it. That's right.
-Time-out! Time-out!

39:03.427 --> 39:04.511
-Bring it in!
-Come on.

39:04.595 --> 39:06.346
It's all right. Good work.

39:07.055 --> 39:08.056
Good work, Phil.

39:08.891 --> 39:10.392
Hey, you know what I think?

39:11.393 --> 39:15.731
I think Harrison is cool losing this game
as long as Jace don't beat him.

39:16.231 --> 39:17.441
You think he's petty like that?

39:17.524 --> 39:18.525
Oh, yeah.

39:19.109 --> 39:20.485
Let him pick his own poison?

39:20.569 --> 39:21.987
No, I can be petty too.

39:22.613 --> 39:23.447
Bet.

39:28.660 --> 39:29.995
All right. Listen.

39:30.829 --> 39:33.540
We're gonna help Jace get open
against his old team

39:33.624 --> 39:36.043
-so he can set this place on fire.
-Aight.

39:36.126 --> 39:37.169
Y'all cool with that?

39:37.252 --> 39:39.254
-Yeah! Yes, sir.
-Hell, yeah!

39:39.338 --> 39:40.797
-Let's do it!
-Let's get it!

39:41.840 --> 39:42.841
Draw it up.

39:43.550 --> 39:46.303
All right. Crystal, you coming in.

39:46.929 --> 39:50.474
I'm talking double, even triple screens
if we have to.

39:50.557 --> 39:53.101
Let him eat. We running mamba.

39:55.145 --> 39:56.146
Bring it in!

39:58.190 --> 39:59.316
Swagger on three!

39:59.399 --> 40:00.817
-One, two, three…
-Swagger!

40:03.153 --> 40:04.613
Get out of my face, bruh.

40:07.366 --> 40:08.408
Whatcha got?

40:18.585 --> 40:19.628
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Let's go!

40:22.297 --> 40:24.341
-Just like that!
-That was great.

40:24.424 --> 40:26.593
Hey! Hey! Y'all understand English, right?

40:27.219 --> 40:29.930
Jace Carson does not get open!

40:42.234 --> 40:45.320
Hey! Who's sorry now? Who's sorry now?

40:55.581 --> 40:57.082
Phil. Hey, Phil!

40:58.208 --> 40:59.418
Pass, pass, pass!

41:05.257 --> 41:06.341
Let's go, Phillie!

41:11.096 --> 41:12.097
My bad.

41:22.482 --> 41:24.443
Come on! That's what I'm talking about!

41:24.526 --> 41:25.694
Let's go!

41:26.862 --> 41:28.614
Push it! Push it!

41:32.910 --> 41:34.036
Oh, yeah!

41:40.334 --> 41:41.335
We'll see you, huh?

41:41.418 --> 41:43.378
-We still family.
-Hey, be easy, bro.

41:51.011 --> 41:53.430
-This is too crazy.
-I know, right?

41:54.515 --> 41:55.641
Hey, man, I'll be right back.

41:55.724 --> 41:57.392
Okay, cool.
All right, I'll catch you later.

41:59.478 --> 42:00.812
Hey, excuse me.

42:00.896 --> 42:03.065
You're the equipment rep
for Shoot-A-Way, right?

42:03.148 --> 42:05.275
I haven't seen you
at one of our games before.

42:05.359 --> 42:09.279
I mean, we love our new toy,
but rebound machines are big bucks.

42:09.363 --> 42:10.739
Why the sudden charity?

42:11.406 --> 42:13.534
I might not be
the guy that deserves the praise.

42:14.117 --> 42:15.202
Congrats on the win.

42:23.752 --> 42:25.003
Really? You?

42:25.629 --> 42:26.797
Me what?

42:26.880 --> 42:31.134
You have any idea why a Shoot-A-Way rep
is wearing limited-edition Gladiators?

42:33.470 --> 42:34.555
He has good taste.

42:35.430 --> 42:36.765
And how expensive are those?

42:39.685 --> 42:42.813
Wow. I don't think I wanna know
what you had to do to get that pool fixed.

42:42.896 --> 42:46.191
All right. Okay,
let's just keep this between us, okay?

42:46.275 --> 42:47.276
Why?

42:49.987 --> 42:53.574
What happened at the diner with your team,
the way your kids stood up…

42:54.533 --> 42:56.577
I just wanted to show some respect. Okay?

42:56.660 --> 42:59.371
So, I may have found
some money and some kicks

42:59.454 --> 43:01.582
and got you guys a shooting machine.

43:02.082 --> 43:03.417
How's it work, by the way?

43:03.500 --> 43:06.628
Not too shabby. Ike wasn't too happy about
the water in the pool though.

43:08.172 --> 43:10.549
Yeah, that was a little trickier
to pull off, not gonna lie.

43:11.091 --> 43:14.178
So, your bosses know about
all the respect you're showing Swagger?

43:15.053 --> 43:16.722
Well, what my bosses know is that

43:16.805 --> 43:20.058
the Dominion Ballers are our team
in the DMV. Swagger isn't.

43:20.809 --> 43:24.104
But certainly, you're a man who'll
do the right thing.

43:25.564 --> 43:26.940
I'm a man who's a realist.

43:27.441 --> 43:28.817
That's what got me in the room.

43:28.901 --> 43:31.987
And if I stay there,
I can do good now and then.

43:32.070 --> 43:33.488
So, we're just your sidepiece?

43:34.489 --> 43:35.741
I gotta stay in the room.

43:42.331 --> 43:43.373
Mr. Marksby.

43:44.082 --> 43:46.919
What's with the surprise visit?
Wasn't part of the deal.

43:47.628 --> 43:49.922
I don't know what you been
telling my boy about me.

43:50.005 --> 43:51.715
Now, hold on, hold on.

43:51.798 --> 43:54.551
I'm not beefing with you, Coach.
But I do have to say something. Okay?

43:57.179 --> 43:58.597
You know, when…

44:00.849 --> 44:02.768
When so many things happened this year,

44:02.851 --> 44:06.355
you know, the pandemic, George Floyd,
everything--

44:06.438 --> 44:09.107
It made me think about you, you know?

44:09.900 --> 44:13.654
And it hurt not to call you and guide you.

44:14.404 --> 44:17.407
You know, it hurt knowing that
as much as I'm trying to protect you,

44:18.325 --> 44:19.451
you scared of me.

44:21.870 --> 44:25.374
You sent me to school
bruised up and limping.

44:25.457 --> 44:26.834
More than once.

44:27.543 --> 44:29.002
How am I supposed to be?

44:31.046 --> 44:32.089
Yeah, I'm--

44:33.340 --> 44:38.554
I'm in this Family Preservation program
that Ike's wife got me in.

44:38.637 --> 44:40.222
I'm learning parenting strategies.

44:40.305 --> 44:43.809
And soon I'ma show 'em that I'm fit enough
to have you come back and stay with me.

44:46.353 --> 44:47.437
All right, Marksby.

44:49.189 --> 44:50.357
He's your coach.

44:52.234 --> 44:53.235
But I'm your father.

45:03.078 --> 45:04.246
You all right?

45:05.622 --> 45:06.623
Yeah.

45:08.083 --> 45:09.126
Let's go home.

45:27.269 --> 45:29.229
So, you're really not gonna ask
about my game?

45:30.022 --> 45:31.148
How was your game?

45:35.360 --> 45:36.403
You didn't stream it?

45:37.112 --> 45:38.113
No.

45:46.622 --> 45:47.706
I played well.

45:48.665 --> 45:50.083
It's too bad you didn't watch it.

45:51.084 --> 45:53.420
It's too bad the people
who could've watched it

45:54.046 --> 45:58.217
aren't appreciated and is thought
to be trying to hold their son back.

45:58.842 --> 46:00.719
You know, I don't think you're right
about Coach.

46:06.391 --> 46:07.809
I'm gonna ask him myself.

46:17.694 --> 46:18.820
Can I get a ride?

46:36.588 --> 46:37.589
What's up, Coach?

46:38.090 --> 46:39.925
Jace, what's going on?
What you doing here?

46:40.008 --> 46:41.093
I was hoping we could talk.

46:44.221 --> 46:45.472
All right, let's do it outside.

46:57.109 --> 46:58.110
So, what's up?

47:00.279 --> 47:02.614
I wanted to ask you about
that state championship game.

47:03.949 --> 47:05.158
From your senior year.

47:06.326 --> 47:07.327
What about it?

47:09.371 --> 47:10.998
Is that when you and your pops fell out?

47:11.999 --> 47:13.041
What?

47:14.501 --> 47:16.253
I was just wondering what it was about.

47:17.754 --> 47:19.006
It's personal.

47:21.091 --> 47:23.343
And you and Lester also fell out
after that game, right?

47:25.554 --> 47:26.847
Where you going with this, Jace?

47:26.930 --> 47:28.223
My moms is saying something about

47:28.307 --> 47:30.559
how people used to bet
on high school games around here.

47:34.104 --> 47:36.023
-Your moms?
-Yeah.

47:36.106 --> 47:38.317
Anyway, Coach, all those missed shots,

47:39.109 --> 47:40.444
all those turnovers,

47:41.695 --> 47:44.865
were they running some kind of
defensive scheme you weren't ready for?

47:44.948 --> 47:46.033
Were you scared?

47:47.701 --> 47:49.411
Or did you miss on purpose?

47:53.415 --> 47:56.293
-What you want me to tell you?
-What do I want you to tell me?

47:56.877 --> 47:57.961
Want you to tell me the truth.

47:58.045 --> 47:59.588
It's complicated.

47:59.671 --> 48:00.714
What's so complicated?

48:00.797 --> 48:04.134
All you have to say is, "No, Jace,
I didn't miss all those shots on purpose.

48:04.676 --> 48:06.011
Now get off my damn property."

48:06.094 --> 48:08.680
-It ain't that black-and-white.
-It is that black-and-white.

48:08.764 --> 48:12.768
24-hour person.
Someone you can rely on 24 hours a day.

48:13.519 --> 48:16.188
Remember that? Or was that all bullshit?

48:16.271 --> 48:17.397
Of course not.

48:18.148 --> 48:21.902
How can someone say they love the game
and tank in the State Championship?

48:26.448 --> 48:27.616
My moms was right about you.

48:27.699 --> 48:29.368
Your team had to play
against the other team

48:29.451 --> 48:30.786
and play against one of their own.

48:32.996 --> 48:33.997
Go home, Jace.

48:34.081 --> 48:35.582
That African proverb,

48:35.666 --> 48:37.835
"If the enemy within can't harm us…"

48:38.836 --> 48:40.504
Your father taught you that, right?

48:40.587 --> 48:41.588
Yeah.

48:42.256 --> 48:43.590
'Cause you're the enemy within.

48:43.674 --> 48:44.675
What?

48:46.134 --> 48:47.970
No wonder he was done with you.

48:48.470 --> 48:51.014
My father died thinking
I was a piece of shit.

48:53.058 --> 48:56.895
You think I really give a damn about
what you think about me? Really?

48:57.771 --> 48:59.857
Now, you can get the hell off my property.

49:00.691 --> 49:01.859
We're done.
