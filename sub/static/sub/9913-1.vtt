01:48.752 --> 01:50.777
Oh, shit.

02:11.307 --> 02:12.467
You just got Wolfed.

02:13.376 --> 02:15.241
- What?
- That is an official trademark...

02:15.445 --> 02:17.007
...that I am
getting registered.

02:17.414 --> 02:20.383
It's a lot of stuff you gotta do,
hoops you gotta jump through.

02:20.583 --> 02:21.811
Gotta get on the Internet.

02:22.018 --> 02:26.182
Gotta go to some stupid-ass website
where you register a catch phrase.

02:26.389 --> 02:29.722
I wanted "Bam,"
but Emeril had taken it.

02:31.227 --> 02:33.354
I'm rambling, man.
Get up, man. Get up, man.

02:36.833 --> 02:38.164
Is the contender ready?

02:38.368 --> 02:40.768
- Ready.
- Is the gladiator ready?

02:42.939 --> 02:45.339
Three, two, one.

02:45.809 --> 02:47.401
Things are heating up for the Wolf.

02:47.977 --> 02:49.842
I just opened a Target in Reseda...

02:50.513 --> 02:53.243
...and my own brand of BBQ sauce.

02:53.716 --> 02:59.086
I'm calling it Wolf's BBQ Sauce,
available in regular and chipotle.

03:00.523 --> 03:02.753
You still going?
You still want more of this, man?

03:02.959 --> 03:04.950
I learned that in Oriental land.

03:05.161 --> 03:08.028
Whoa, yeah. U.S. A!

03:13.136 --> 03:16.037
They're so small anyway, from steroids.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.123
A saber-tooth.

03:44.434 --> 03:45.833
Amy Winehouse?

03:51.107 --> 03:52.301
Piss off.

03:52.509 --> 03:55.478
You don't wanna mess with
a bitch straight out of rehab.

03:56.279 --> 04:01.649
Listen, like the dinosaurs
being destroyed by the Ice Age...

04:01.851 --> 04:05.252
...you, too, will soon be extinct.

04:05.455 --> 04:06.683
When?

04:06.890 --> 04:09.791
- How much time do we have?
- Bloody hell.

04:10.293 --> 04:13.023
Just calm down.
Do you know you're speaking so fast...

04:13.229 --> 04:16.596
...I can't even hear, mate?
You're making my head hurt.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.699
Or maybe that was
the gasoline I drank.

04:18.902 --> 04:23.737
Oh, my God, it was good.
Oh, God, I love drinking gasoline.

04:23.940 --> 04:26.204
It's excellent for the vocal cords.

04:26.409 --> 04:28.001
That's my little secret.

04:28.211 --> 04:30.509
- You're welcome.
- How much time do we have?

04:31.548 --> 04:33.277
Let me see.

04:33.483 --> 04:34.609
Hang on a bit.

04:36.085 --> 04:37.143
There we go.

04:38.187 --> 04:40.485
All right, let's have a look-see.

04:43.226 --> 04:44.818
Everyone's on Facebook.

04:45.028 --> 04:46.996
It says...

04:48.231 --> 04:54.170
...that the end of the world
will be August 29th, 2008.

04:57.674 --> 04:58.732
Oh, God.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.607
Bottoms up.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.584
Sick.

05:53.262 --> 05:56.459
Mark my words, leather boy.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.630
Cave dweller.

05:58.835 --> 06:01.429
Beaver hunter.

06:03.272 --> 06:08.073
Your doom lies with this.

06:10.780 --> 06:14.272
- The crystal skull.
- That's right. Did your nibblies go tight?

06:14.484 --> 06:16.975
Yeah, they did. Just went up
inside you, didn't they?

06:26.129 --> 06:27.255
Oh, boy.

06:33.803 --> 06:36.704
I knew I shouldn't have
taken all those Ambien.

06:46.082 --> 06:49.950
Amy. Wake up, baby.
I just had the weirdest dream.

06:50.586 --> 06:52.053
Amy.

06:52.355 --> 06:53.788
What? What the...?

06:53.990 --> 06:57.357
Flava-Flav! Yeah, boy!

06:57.560 --> 06:59.858
I've been giving your girl
the flavor of love.

07:00.063 --> 07:03.624
She's been sucking
my clock all night long.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.357
Get the hell out of here, Flava!

07:06.202 --> 07:08.500
I'm Flava-Flav!

07:12.408 --> 07:14.774
- What is that about?
- What?

07:14.977 --> 07:17.207
You said you didn't
wanna be in a relationship.

07:18.114 --> 07:20.708
I know, but Flava?

07:22.085 --> 07:23.712
Will...

07:25.455 --> 07:27.355
...I wanna take it to the next level.

07:32.662 --> 07:33.822
I love you.

07:35.598 --> 07:37.532
I like you too.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.867
Oh, man.

07:43.206 --> 07:45.231
Look, you don't understand.

07:45.441 --> 07:47.875
I think the world is coming to an end.

07:48.911 --> 07:51.141
That's a way of saying
you have commitment issues.

07:53.082 --> 07:56.540
Unbelievable. Come on, Jojo.

07:59.355 --> 08:00.413
You're taking Jojo?

08:01.924 --> 08:02.913
Goodbye, Will.

08:05.428 --> 08:07.521
Are you still coming
to my Sweet 16 party?

08:08.097 --> 08:09.564
You're 25.

08:09.766 --> 08:12.234
- I never had one.
- Grow up.

08:39.294 --> 08:40.626
Yeah.

08:43.299 --> 08:46.166
- Hey.
- Yeah.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.211
Amy, you came.

09:21.470 --> 09:22.937
Come on.

09:23.739 --> 09:25.331
Oh, hey, Will.

09:25.541 --> 09:27.771
- Happy Sweet 16.
- Thanks.

09:28.344 --> 09:30.904
Take a look at these.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.580
Oh, God.

09:35.384 --> 09:38.979
Hey, Will. It's your buddy, Dr. Phil.

09:42.525 --> 09:45.460
Hey, let me show you
why my frat brothers...

09:45.661 --> 09:48.528
...used to call me Dr. Phil-You-Up.

09:48.731 --> 09:50.756
Oh, hey, baby.

09:55.805 --> 09:58.467
Dyke. Come back here, I like it rough.

09:59.275 --> 10:02.108
Hey, Will, where's that
girlfriend of yours, Amy?

10:02.311 --> 10:04.211
Don't let her get away.

10:04.413 --> 10:08.440
She's a real quality girl,
a real keeper, like that one.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.346
Hey, come on back here, you whore.

10:10.887 --> 10:12.445
Thanks.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.714
Yo!

10:16.192 --> 10:19.855
Let's prank his ass. He passed out.

10:29.238 --> 10:30.500
He's sleeping like a baby.

10:31.073 --> 10:33.837
We can put his hands in warm water.

10:35.311 --> 10:36.539
Or I have a better idea.

10:36.746 --> 10:39.476
- Call it.
- Tails.

10:42.251 --> 10:43.240
It is tails.

10:56.232 --> 10:57.756
Punch.

11:01.470 --> 11:03.062
What's up, baby?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.606
Those guys are trying
to steal our booze.

11:05.808 --> 11:07.537
- What?
- We gotta get the alcohol...

11:07.743 --> 11:10.906
...so we can get the girls drunk
so we can finally get laid.

11:11.113 --> 11:12.444
I am McLover.

11:12.648 --> 11:14.912
- Yeah, I know.
- I am McLover.

11:15.117 --> 11:18.245
- Stop saying that.
- I am McLover.

11:18.454 --> 11:20.183
God, you are such a douche.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.687
Yeah, fake ID, what?

11:23.192 --> 11:25.092
Just get the booze.

11:25.294 --> 11:27.387
Nobody tries to steal my GoldschlÃ¤ger.

11:27.596 --> 11:29.689
Shoot the target.

11:32.401 --> 11:35.529
Lisa, how am I supposed to do that?
I don't even have a clear shot.

11:45.014 --> 11:47.539
- Curve the bullet.
- Say what?

11:48.184 --> 11:51.915
You can control the bullet
to go wherever you want.

11:57.293 --> 11:59.420
Don't tell him what to do. He's my man.

11:59.628 --> 12:01.721
Back off, bitch.
You don't want none of me.

12:07.136 --> 12:08.626
Shit.

12:10.006 --> 12:11.132
Get off of me.

12:19.849 --> 12:21.646
Come on, bitch.

12:37.900 --> 12:38.992
Take that, bitch.

12:45.541 --> 12:46.633
How do you like that?

12:52.415 --> 12:55.316
Pretty little thing.
Oh, look at you laying there.

12:55.518 --> 12:59.045
I should kiss you. Give me a kiss, baby.

13:16.038 --> 13:17.835
Left foot, yellow.

13:19.075 --> 13:20.508
Calvin?

13:20.709 --> 13:22.370
Calvin.

13:22.578 --> 13:25.547
- Are you gonna curve the bullet or what?
- Hello?

13:26.148 --> 13:28.582
Yeah. Yeah, right, right.

13:32.254 --> 13:34.814
Let's go back to my hot tub.
You can suck on my...

13:36.559 --> 13:39.221
- Damn.
- Sorry, Phil.

13:44.033 --> 13:47.002
Shit. I can... I can do this.

13:53.275 --> 13:55.072
- Shit. Hurry up.
- Dude.

13:56.245 --> 13:58.406
Just curve the bullet.

13:58.614 --> 14:00.775
I know you have the power.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.559
Fucking hurry up. Hurry up.

14:23.139 --> 14:24.572
Nice shot, asshole.

14:32.548 --> 14:35.745
<i>Juney, why won't you</i>
<i>Have an abortion?</i>

14:35.951 --> 14:39.011
<i>You're not exactly part of</i>
<i>The Christian Coalition</i>

14:39.221 --> 14:43.555
<i>I could just grab a wire hanger</i>
<i>And do it myself</i>

14:45.761 --> 14:48.889
<i>Like Jamie Lynn Spears</i>
<i>I'm keeping this baby</i>

14:49.098 --> 14:52.226
<i>And, look, stud</i>
<i>You are no George Clooney</i>

14:52.434 --> 14:57.064
<i>In fact, I just sold the baby</i>
<i>To the highest bidder on eBay</i>

15:01.977 --> 15:05.105
<i>You're a sarcastic teen</i>
<i>Who talks like she's</i> 30...

15:20.262 --> 15:22.492
- Think Amy's coming tonight?
- Man, I don't know.

15:22.698 --> 15:24.723
That's your girlfriend.

15:24.934 --> 15:26.492
Actually, we broke up.

15:26.702 --> 15:29.034
Oh, you want some new booty.

15:29.238 --> 15:30.466
- A little Asian freak.
- No...

15:30.673 --> 15:33.039
A little "One Night in Bangkok,"
a little <i>sake-sake.</i>

15:33.242 --> 15:36.177
I saw <i>Memoirs of a Geisha.</i>
I know that shit goes on.

15:36.378 --> 15:38.346
I'm in love with her.

15:38.547 --> 15:40.640
Then what your dumb ass
break up with her for?

15:40.849 --> 15:42.612
It never would've worked out.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.048
It's better to end it
than to end up hurting her.

15:45.254 --> 15:47.950
You know what?
You got commitment issues, dog.

15:48.157 --> 15:51.183
Well, I didn't exactly have
the best example growing up.

15:51.393 --> 15:53.793
I never even knew my dad.
He split when I was young.

15:55.931 --> 15:58.058
That's your girl right there.

16:01.704 --> 16:02.898
Who's that dude she with?

16:03.105 --> 16:06.199
She started dating some
Calvin Klein underwear model.

16:10.713 --> 16:13.580
Forget about her, man.
I got something that'll cheer you up.

16:17.553 --> 16:20.545
Dude, what is up
with the marching band?

16:20.756 --> 16:23.554
What better way to celebrate
your super-duper Sweet 16...

16:24.159 --> 16:25.751
...than with a high school musical?

16:34.670 --> 16:38.697
<i>Tonight, tonight</i>
<i>We're gonna get real crunk</i>

16:38.907 --> 16:42.536
<i>Tonight, tonight,</i>
<i>A bum's peeing in the punch</i>

16:47.850 --> 16:51.616
<i>Hello, my friends</i>
<i>You're all at my party</i>

16:51.820 --> 16:55.847
<i>It's so good to see all of you</i>

16:56.058 --> 17:00.085
<i>My ex-girl, Amy</i>
<i>And my main man, Calvin</i>

17:00.296 --> 17:04.198
<i>And the priest that molested me too</i>

17:04.400 --> 17:08.097
<i>That reminds me</i>
<i>Of the time I was in college</i>

17:08.304 --> 17:10.864
<i>I was experimenting</i>

17:12.508 --> 17:16.204
<i>Hooking up with a hot</i>
<i>Foreign-exchange student</i>

17:16.412 --> 17:20.314
<i>I think his name was Hop Sing</i>

17:20.915 --> 17:24.646
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

17:24.853 --> 17:28.983
<i>Unless a random disaster</i>
<i>Destroys the city</i>

17:29.191 --> 17:32.957
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

17:33.162 --> 17:38.031
<i>Because if that happened</i>
<i>It'd be kind of shitty</i>

17:39.034 --> 17:41.127
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

17:41.670 --> 17:45.367
<i>After we split</i>
<i>I took the break-up real hard</i>

17:45.574 --> 17:49.738
- <i>I started foolin' around</i>
- <i>Foolin' around</i>

17:49.945 --> 17:53.779
<i>I did a black dude</i>
<i>I thought he was Kanye</i>

17:53.982 --> 17:57.679
<i>And the Jonas Brothers all got down</i>

17:57.886 --> 18:01.822
<i>Now that you're split</i>
<i>I'll get her hooked on the reefer</i>

18:02.024 --> 18:06.358
<i>Yeah, I'll start pimping her out</i>

18:06.562 --> 18:09.030
- Wait, what?
- Hey, hey, now.

18:09.431 --> 18:12.696
<i>Snoop Dogg's got nothin' on this playa</i>

18:12.901 --> 18:17.770
<i>I'll get the first prize at the Playa's Ball</i>

18:18.140 --> 18:20.870
<i>Hey, hey, man, whoa!</i>

18:21.076 --> 18:24.409
<i>Yeah, it's going on and on</i>
<i>We can do it all day long</i>

18:24.613 --> 18:27.741
<i>It's the new phenomenon, whoa!</i>

18:27.950 --> 18:31.852
<i>Yeah, it's going on and on</i>
<i>It's the new phenomenon</i>

18:33.122 --> 18:36.990
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

18:37.192 --> 18:40.855
<i>Unless a random disaster</i>
<i>Destroys the city</i>

18:41.063 --> 18:44.965
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

18:45.167 --> 18:50.002
<i>Because if that happened</i>
<i>It'd be kind of shitty</i>

18:51.206 --> 18:53.367
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

18:53.575 --> 18:56.305
J.T.'s here. J. T!

18:59.815 --> 19:01.339
<i>Oh, babe</i>

19:03.051 --> 19:05.747
<i>If I sang you a melody</i>

19:05.954 --> 19:10.414
<i>Would you toss me</i>
<i>Your panties?</i>

19:17.299 --> 19:18.891
<i>I don't mean to be a boastful man</i>

19:19.101 --> 19:21.126
<i>But I've done groupies</i>
<i>in my touring van</i>

19:21.336 --> 19:23.201
<i>Britney, Cameron, Scarlett too</i>

19:23.405 --> 19:25.498
<i>They all like a taste of my fondue</i>

19:26.842 --> 19:30.710
<i>Come to think of it</i>
<i>I've had so much ass</i>

19:30.913 --> 19:33.541
<i>All that's left for me is Lance Bass</i>

19:34.950 --> 19:37.885
Look, everyone. It's Jessica Simpson.

19:52.601 --> 19:56.093
<i>My boobs are for Jesus</i>

19:56.305 --> 19:58.603
<i>All of this, all for Jesus</i>

19:58.807 --> 20:00.365
Put your pants back on, Dad.

20:00.576 --> 20:04.307
Go, Romo! Oh, my God.
He's gonna score a basket goal.

20:04.513 --> 20:07.243
Wait. What's it called again?
Oh, my gosh, I totally forget.

20:07.449 --> 20:09.576
What is it, a rubdown?

20:09.785 --> 20:11.685
What? A tickle down.

20:11.887 --> 20:14.583
Oh, a touchdown.

20:14.790 --> 20:16.314
Frigging jinx.

20:18.293 --> 20:19.885
Gosh.

20:20.662 --> 20:24.257
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

20:24.600 --> 20:28.593
<i>Unless a random disaster</i>
<i>Destroys the city</i>

20:28.804 --> 20:33.002
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

20:33.208 --> 20:37.907
<i>Because if that happened</i>
<i>It'd be kind of shitty</i>

20:38.814 --> 20:41.510
<i>One, two, three, four, hooray!</i>

20:46.188 --> 20:47.678
What's going on?

20:54.696 --> 20:55.754
What the hell was that?

20:55.964 --> 20:58.023
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

20:58.233 --> 21:00.133
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

21:00.335 --> 21:02.303
Shut up, everybody. Listen.

21:02.504 --> 21:04.028
<i>Something has jolted the city.</i>

21:04.239 --> 21:07.902
<i>We're getting reports it could be</i>
<i>an earthquake or some shit like that.</i>

21:08.110 --> 21:09.134
Oh, shit.

21:09.344 --> 21:13.041
<i>Seismologists have marked</i>
<i>the epicenter at a trendy loft district...</i>

21:13.248 --> 21:15.648
<i>... whose residents</i>
<i>are attractive twentysomethings...</i>

21:15.851 --> 21:17.682
<i>... who dance to bad '80s music...</i>

21:17.886 --> 21:21.947
<i>... wear Abercrombie & Fitch,</i>
<i>and like to drink light beer.</i>

21:22.925 --> 21:24.722
Oh, God, we're all gonna die!

21:26.161 --> 21:28.186
Take a Xanax, Fabio.

21:28.397 --> 21:32.333
You're wigging harder than a
smack addict at an Iggy show circa '73.

21:32.801 --> 21:33.927
What?

21:34.136 --> 21:38.129
It's cool, Moe Dee. Sir Cries-a-Lot.

21:38.740 --> 21:40.731
You're totally giving me the stink eye.

21:42.578 --> 21:44.512
FYI, Battlecrotch Galactica...

21:44.713 --> 21:46.943
...you're grape smuggling
harder than Cornelius...

21:47.149 --> 21:51.051
...in <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>
The original, not Tim Burton's.

21:51.253 --> 21:54.245
And BT-dubs,
I haven't seen a six-pack like that...

21:54.456 --> 21:57.892
...since I shotgunned
Molson Golden at Lollapalooza.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.425
I don't understand a thing you're saying.

22:00.629 --> 22:05.066
That's because I speak in overly written,
clever-for-clever's-sake quips.

22:14.209 --> 22:16.439
Time to get this sea monkey plastered.

22:31.994 --> 22:34.986
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

22:37.899 --> 22:41.357
- Amy. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

22:42.270 --> 22:44.238
Why did you bring
another guy to my party?

22:44.439 --> 22:47.203
- Why do you care?
- Because l...

22:48.610 --> 22:50.077
I don't.

22:51.613 --> 22:53.205
I'm out of here.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.609
Later, bitch.

22:56.018 --> 22:57.246
You know what, Will?

22:57.452 --> 23:00.944
Every time we made love,
I was thinking about another guy.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.447
Well, so was I.

23:07.696 --> 23:09.493
- Damn it.
- Will!

23:10.499 --> 23:12.057
You gotta hear this.

23:12.434 --> 23:15.562
<i>The quake erupted a gas main</i>
<i>and destroyed the ghetto.</i>

23:16.772 --> 23:20.071
- <i>I can live with that.</i>
- Oh, hell, no.

23:20.275 --> 23:22.175
- Cracker.
- <i>We're now getting reports...</i>

23:22.377 --> 23:24.937
<i>... that asteroids are falling</i>
<i>out of the sky and...</i>

23:25.147 --> 23:26.307
End of the world.

23:26.515 --> 23:28.642
<i>And a Pinkberry</i>
<i>has just been destroyed.</i>

23:33.822 --> 23:35.153
It's like my dream.

23:37.292 --> 23:40.455
<i>I repeat, a Pinkberry</i>
<i>has just been destroyed.</i>

23:59.648 --> 24:01.582
God, what the hell's happening?

24:01.783 --> 24:04.274
- I think it's the apocalypse.
- It's Armageddon.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.044
I think I just shit myself.

24:22.304 --> 24:23.293
Let's go.

24:26.308 --> 24:29.072
Oh, my God. Hannah Montana's dead.

24:31.213 --> 24:33.647
Oh, no.

24:33.849 --> 24:37.285
Well, goodbye, all my fans.

24:37.486 --> 24:39.044
Keep rocking.

24:47.095 --> 24:50.861
She is a national treasure!

24:54.736 --> 24:56.931
Also, remind your parents...

24:57.139 --> 25:00.575
...to pick up your official
Hannah Montana lunchbox...

25:00.776 --> 25:02.937
...Hannah Montana cheese grater...

25:03.145 --> 25:05.079
...and Hannah Montana toilet paper.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.977
And be sure to tune in
to my Summer in Montana concert...

25:09.184 --> 25:13.314
...this Wednesday, 8, 7 Central.

25:15.724 --> 25:19.216
I waited in line
for two days for these tickets.

25:19.427 --> 25:20.951
Damn.

25:23.198 --> 25:29.433
And let me just say, those totally sexy
and utterly provocative pictures of me...

25:29.638 --> 25:35.076
...were leaked onto MySpace
completely without my permission.

25:35.577 --> 25:38.011
But if you'll notice in those pictures...

25:38.213 --> 25:40.181
...l'm wearing my new line of sexy...

25:40.382 --> 25:46.082
...Hannah Montana lingerie,
now available at Target.

25:55.263 --> 25:57.788
Oh, my God. Hannah Montana
is really Miley Cyrus.

25:57.999 --> 26:00.763
Well, duh. No shit, Sherlock.

26:00.969 --> 26:04.427
All I do is wear a wig
and change my voice a little bit...

26:04.639 --> 26:07.802
...and those dumb kids
can't tell the difference.

26:08.009 --> 26:11.604
Then I get twice the pay
and twice the merchandise.

26:11.813 --> 26:14.179
Just a reminder,
my new CD comes out.

26:14.382 --> 26:17.317
<i>Miley Cyrus: Underage.</i>

26:17.519 --> 26:22.115
It's available in stores now.
Featuring songs from my dad, Billy Ray.

26:22.324 --> 26:25.623
Only 9.95.

26:29.931 --> 26:31.330
Can somebody help us?

26:31.533 --> 26:33.467
Isn't there anybody that can help?

26:38.240 --> 26:40.037
Hey, Hancock.

26:41.009 --> 26:42.670
Hancock?

26:43.545 --> 26:44.773
We need help.

26:46.715 --> 26:48.376
Wake up, you drunk motherfucker.

26:48.583 --> 26:51.780
Get your punk ass up,
fly down there, and fix that shit.

26:53.755 --> 26:55.620
Asshole!

27:01.730 --> 27:03.163
Oh, hell, no.

27:03.365 --> 27:05.162
Big Willie's out of here.

27:12.974 --> 27:15.067
I need a drink.

27:23.084 --> 27:24.847
Holy shit!

27:25.053 --> 27:27.317
- It's coming this way.
- What should we do?

27:27.522 --> 27:30.457
- Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.
- Let's go!

27:33.194 --> 27:35.321
This way. Over here.
Come on. Come on.

27:35.864 --> 27:36.888
Go, go, go.

27:44.706 --> 27:47.698
- What are we gonna do now?
- Baby, I don't know.

27:47.909 --> 27:49.171
Look, we'll just...

27:49.377 --> 27:52.005
We'll wait out the storm here
until it passes by.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.573
Hey.

28:01.056 --> 28:03.024
This is our hiding place.

28:03.224 --> 28:06.352
Get lost. Right, Carrie?

28:07.729 --> 28:09.253
Hello, lover.

28:12.567 --> 28:14.626
Unless you wanna fight.

28:14.836 --> 28:16.895
Look, we don't want any trouble.

28:23.511 --> 28:24.739
I never back down.

28:24.946 --> 28:29.815
- Get some.
- As you can see, I already did.

28:33.621 --> 28:37.284
<i>And so I thought: Could a simple</i>
<i>New York City gal like me...</i>

28:37.492 --> 28:41.258
<i>... really beat the shit</i>
<i>out of a pregnant teenager? I wonder.</i>

28:41.463 --> 28:45.957
Like Dolph Lundgren in <i>Rocky IV,</i>
I must break you.

28:54.275 --> 28:55.833
- Yes!
- Yeah!

29:15.797 --> 29:18.129
I'm lactating. Moo.

29:20.001 --> 29:22.299
Got milk?

29:30.712 --> 29:32.373
Oh, God.

29:38.753 --> 29:40.448
- Is that your feet?
- Yeah.

29:40.655 --> 29:43.215
And this is my baby's foot.

29:45.927 --> 29:47.224
Smell it.

29:49.264 --> 29:50.288
And taste it.

29:52.033 --> 29:54.058
Suck on my placenta.

29:57.172 --> 29:59.936
- Yeah!
- Oh, Carrie.

30:00.141 --> 30:02.132
Carrie, darling, are you all right?

30:02.343 --> 30:05.005
Come on, ladies.
Let's get out of here now.

30:11.086 --> 30:12.986
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

30:13.188 --> 30:15.713
Wake up and smell the Prius.

30:15.924 --> 30:19.826
I know it's an inconvenient truth,
but it's called global warming.

30:20.028 --> 30:22.861
No. No, it's not global warming.

30:24.365 --> 30:26.560
Amy Winehouse
came to me in my dreams...

30:26.768 --> 30:28.599
...after I fought an American Gladiator.

30:29.070 --> 30:31.561
I think it has something to do
with the crystal skull...

30:32.941 --> 30:35.671
Come on. Crackhead Winehouse?
Crystal skull?

30:35.877 --> 30:37.174
You sound like a crazy man.

30:37.378 --> 30:40.905
Look, it's getting late. Let's just stay
here tonight and wait out the storm.

30:41.349 --> 30:42.680
I'm freezing.

30:43.218 --> 30:44.617
We gotta take off our clothes.

30:46.688 --> 30:50.317
- What?
- Our bodies will keep each other warm.

30:50.525 --> 30:53.392
Otherwise, we're not gonna make it
through the night.

30:54.362 --> 30:55.693
Yeah. Yeah.

30:56.131 --> 30:58.622
He's right. Come on.

31:07.809 --> 31:09.868
I think my water's gonna break.

31:10.612 --> 31:11.601
Water?

31:15.350 --> 31:17.011
What the...?

31:18.186 --> 31:19.778
Sorry.

31:24.259 --> 31:26.989
Look, I have something to tell you.
I'm not really a banker.

31:27.195 --> 31:28.719
- I'm a jumper.
- A what?

31:28.930 --> 31:30.659
I can teleport through time and space.

31:59.928 --> 32:02.362
I hope we stay together forever.

32:02.564 --> 32:03.758
I love you.

32:06.167 --> 32:07.532
Later.

32:11.639 --> 32:14.972
I am Prince Caspian,
here to save Narnia.

32:18.079 --> 32:19.637
Little help?

32:21.316 --> 32:22.943
You guys?

32:27.155 --> 32:29.123
It's the guy who ruined <i>Star Wars.</i>

32:34.729 --> 32:37.664
- What?
- Will, we saw your dream.

32:40.635 --> 32:42.933
- Oh, man.
- Man, you messed shit up with Amy.

32:43.137 --> 32:45.731
You're lucky a girl like that
would even talk to you.

32:45.940 --> 32:49.034
She's hot, sexy. She got a job.

32:49.410 --> 32:52.902
- Man, that girl out your league.
- She's not out of my league.

32:53.114 --> 32:55.878
Shit, she gotta put up
with your stank breath.

32:56.551 --> 32:59.918
Not to mention your
abnormally high plumber's crack.

33:05.126 --> 33:06.423
Man, put your shirt down.

33:06.628 --> 33:09.654
All right. You're right, you're right.
I messed up with Amy.

33:12.967 --> 33:14.730
I never should've let her go.

33:17.238 --> 33:19.866
Jesus Christ. That was a rump shaker.

33:20.074 --> 33:23.407
Okay, here's the plan.
We gotta get the hell up out this city.

33:23.611 --> 33:25.203
What you say?

33:25.947 --> 33:29.212
What the hell y'all doing leaving me?

33:31.719 --> 33:33.914
Keep it moving, people. Nothing to see.

33:34.922 --> 33:38.255
All the disasters have been contained.
The city is secure.

33:44.632 --> 33:45.621
Shit.

33:47.135 --> 33:48.124
Sick.

33:50.905 --> 33:53.897
Like I said, keep moving.
It's under control.

33:58.913 --> 33:59.902
I'm out of here.

34:06.087 --> 34:09.523
- What was that?
- That was a head. That was a head.

34:09.724 --> 34:12.215
- Hello?
- Whose head?

34:12.427 --> 34:13.724
- Hello?
- <i>Will, it's me.</i>

34:13.928 --> 34:15.725
Amy, where are you?

34:15.929 --> 34:18.989
I'm at work at the museum.
I was worried about the artifacts.

34:19.199 --> 34:22.135
- Are you okay?
- I'm scared.

34:22.737 --> 34:24.728
It's gonna be all right, I promise. Listen.

34:24.938 --> 34:27.703
There is something
that I need to tell you...

34:27.909 --> 34:30.172
...and I should've told you long before.
I was an idiot.

34:34.315 --> 34:35.339
I love you.

34:37.851 --> 34:40.150
<i>Oh, baby, I love you too.</i>

34:42.290 --> 34:46.090
What do...? What do you say?
Do you still love me?

34:46.293 --> 34:49.024
<i>Yes, yes, of course, yes.</i>

34:49.731 --> 34:50.719
<i>Say something.</i>

34:52.800 --> 34:54.358
Say something, you stuck-up bitch.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.166
Asshole.

35:01.008 --> 35:02.600
Hello? Hello, Amy?

35:03.511 --> 35:05.138
Shit.

35:07.582 --> 35:09.379
Oh, what the...?

35:10.151 --> 35:12.051
- We gotta go back.
- Say what?

35:12.253 --> 35:14.050
Amy's in trouble.
I'm going back for her.

35:14.255 --> 35:16.348
I let her go before.
I'm not losing her again.

35:16.557 --> 35:19.754
Man, you crazy. There's all kinds
of shit breaking out in the city.

35:19.961 --> 35:22.452
We don't leave right now,
we're gonna die.

35:22.663 --> 35:24.324
It's something I gotta do.

35:24.532 --> 35:25.624
You guys keep going.

35:29.103 --> 35:31.196
No, I'm your boy, man.
I'm gonna roll with you.

35:31.406 --> 35:33.806
Yeah, I mean, I'm already knocked up...

35:34.008 --> 35:38.172
...so, what other shenanigans
can I really get into?

35:38.379 --> 35:41.906
I mean, I'm more bloated
than Vince Vaughn in <i>The Break-Up...</i>

35:42.116 --> 35:44.550
...or Vince Vaughn in <i>Fred Claus...</i>

35:46.053 --> 35:48.021
...or I guess Vince Vaughn in general.

35:48.222 --> 35:50.918
- So let's go.
- Yeah, please.

35:53.327 --> 35:54.885
Lisa, come on.

35:55.096 --> 35:57.189
- No, guys.
- Come on, baby.

35:57.398 --> 35:59.366
I really have a bad feeling about this.

36:04.405 --> 36:05.895
Lisa!

36:06.107 --> 36:07.665
They killed Lisa!

36:07.875 --> 36:09.001
- Lisa!
- Come on, come on.

36:09.210 --> 36:12.304
- They killed Lisa! You bastards!
- Come on, come on. We gotta go.

36:12.513 --> 36:14.037
Come on.

36:21.656 --> 36:24.557
I'm really sorry about your girlfriend,
home skillet.

36:24.759 --> 36:27.557
<i>Lo ciento</i> about your main squeeze,
kemosabe.

36:27.762 --> 36:33.598
I'd offer you my sexual favors, but
I've got a lot of mucus discharge lately.

36:33.801 --> 36:35.063
Lisa was a great girl.

36:45.279 --> 36:47.304
Lisa who?

36:47.748 --> 36:49.045
Oh, where am I?

36:49.517 --> 36:51.917
Oh, what an enchanting place.

36:53.821 --> 36:56.881
It smells like meat and stress.

37:00.561 --> 37:01.619
Wonderful.

37:02.497 --> 37:03.964
What magical creature are you?

37:10.571 --> 37:12.038
<i>My dear prince</i>

37:12.240 --> 37:20.614
<i>You have rescued me</i>
<i>You've caught me in your arms</i>

37:20.815 --> 37:26.082
<i>Actually, you landed on my balls</i>

37:26.287 --> 37:27.618
Let me guess.

37:27.822 --> 37:31.815
An evil witch banished you
from your fairy-tale kingdom?

37:33.828 --> 37:36.296
No, my silly, pasty, quirky teen.

37:36.497 --> 37:39.989
Actually, I'm just a demented
homeless chick who lives in the sewers.

37:41.135 --> 37:42.796
- How'd you end up there?
- Drugs.

37:43.004 --> 37:46.303
Lots and lots and lots...

37:46.507 --> 37:51.137
...of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!

37:53.614 --> 37:55.639
I don't judge.

37:58.352 --> 37:59.910
It's dangerous out there.

38:00.121 --> 38:02.954
You might wanna come with us
if you wanna live.

38:03.157 --> 38:04.590
- Okay.
- All right.

38:04.792 --> 38:07.727
- Goodbye. Oh, I'm going with you.
- Yes, you are.

38:07.929 --> 38:10.796
The Natural History Museum
is just uptown. Let's go.

38:16.270 --> 38:20.639
<i>Dreams and fairy tales</i>
<i>My true love</i>

38:21.275 --> 38:26.178
<i>Talking squirrels and magic and stuff</i>

38:26.814 --> 38:29.715
No, princess, wait.
Where are you going?

38:29.917 --> 38:32.351
And who's that Moorish ruffian?

38:32.553 --> 38:34.851
I'm her new boyfriend. What it do?

38:36.390 --> 38:39.518
Very funny, dark peasant.
I'm Prince Edwin.

38:40.595 --> 38:43.928
- Princess, he your pimp?
- Oh, good heavens, yes.

38:45.967 --> 38:49.334
But that's all right.
I could have a pimp and a boyfriend.

38:50.237 --> 38:51.431
Oh, what to do?

38:53.841 --> 38:58.403
Whichever prince can vanquish
the other shall win my hand.

39:05.519 --> 39:06.611
You ready to step up?

39:08.089 --> 39:10.148
Wait. You mean like
the first <i>Step Up</i> movie...

39:10.358 --> 39:13.054
...where the street-dancer dude
went to the dance academy?

39:13.260 --> 39:15.319
No, I was thinking
more like <i>Step Up 2...</i>

39:15.529 --> 39:18.430
...when the tough street-dancing chick
went to dancing academy.

39:19.333 --> 39:20.391
I feel you.

39:20.601 --> 39:24.435
He ain't ready for me. Juney, Will,
I'm about to break him down, baby.

39:24.639 --> 39:26.971
You want some? Well, here you go.

39:36.584 --> 39:38.313
Oh, a hoedown?

39:40.655 --> 39:41.644
It's crazy-shirt man.

39:46.861 --> 39:48.954
Oh, no, no, no.

39:54.168 --> 39:55.567
It's just my sleeve.

39:55.770 --> 39:57.795
Oh, come on.

39:58.706 --> 40:00.571
He's double-jointed.
Who cares about that?

40:03.010 --> 40:04.568
There must be a mirror somewhere.

40:07.248 --> 40:09.113
Make some room. Make some room.

40:09.316 --> 40:10.578
Make some room.

40:10.785 --> 40:13.276
- Come on, chubby.
- Okay.

40:14.889 --> 40:16.857
What? What? What?

40:17.358 --> 40:19.952
Oh, damn, that ho is all on point.

40:30.871 --> 40:33.635
That bitch better work.
She is off the chizzain.

40:33.841 --> 40:34.967
I think she's crowning.

40:37.845 --> 40:39.608
I want to dance.

40:39.814 --> 40:43.181
I'm not sure I can though. I'm not sure.

40:43.384 --> 40:46.353
l... Don't pressure me!

40:48.155 --> 40:49.782
I'm ready.

40:50.324 --> 40:52.724
Oh, look out. Look at her coming in.

40:54.395 --> 40:55.521
Oh, yeah.

41:37.171 --> 41:39.332
I'm out of here.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.268
Bye.

41:41.475 --> 41:43.909
She's all yours, bro.

41:44.512 --> 41:45.843
It's a twister!

41:46.046 --> 41:48.241
Run! Run!

41:55.823 --> 41:57.950
Is there anyone that can save us?

41:58.159 --> 42:00.059
We need a hero.

42:08.202 --> 42:09.897
I am Iron Man.

42:12.506 --> 42:15.566
Oh, man! That twister shat out a cow.

42:17.044 --> 42:18.409
Shit. That's so messed up.

42:22.349 --> 42:24.783
Now you're pissing me off.

42:27.655 --> 42:30.146
I'm the only badass around here.

42:32.626 --> 42:34.321
Oh, damn!

42:34.528 --> 42:36.223
Another cow?

42:42.970 --> 42:44.437
What was that?

42:44.638 --> 42:46.003
It's not nice.

42:46.207 --> 42:48.607
Look at me. Look at this.

42:48.809 --> 42:50.401
It's a lobster claw.

42:50.611 --> 42:51.600
Whatever.

42:51.812 --> 42:55.407
Look, I'm carrying a lot of baggage.
I didn't need that, man.

42:59.286 --> 43:03.723
Don't make me angry.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

43:04.191 --> 43:07.991
There's aspects of my personality
that I can't control.

43:25.846 --> 43:27.746
At least he didn't get hit with a cow.

43:30.484 --> 43:33.351
- Man!
- Hey, Casanova, forget Amy.

43:33.554 --> 43:35.454
We're never gonna make it
to the museum.

43:35.656 --> 43:36.987
I know she's still alive.

43:37.191 --> 43:39.455
<i>Hello? Jojo?</i>

43:39.660 --> 43:42.220
Jojo? No, no, it's me.

43:42.429 --> 43:44.693
Will. Will, I'm trapped.

43:44.899 --> 43:48.494
<i>An Egyptian statue fell on me</i>
<i>during the earthquake.</i>

43:48.702 --> 43:50.863
<i>Stay calm, Amy. Just stay calm.</i>

43:51.071 --> 43:53.904
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

43:54.108 --> 43:56.804
All right, Amy, listen to me. Don't panic.

43:59.747 --> 44:01.544
I will be there, I promise.

44:05.085 --> 44:07.315
Amy? Amy?

44:09.590 --> 44:11.751
Guys, I'm going back for her.

44:14.595 --> 44:18.531
You can't save her if you're dead!
Come on, let's go!

44:18.732 --> 44:20.563
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Go, go.

44:20.768 --> 44:21.860
Goodbye.

44:22.069 --> 44:23.263
- Amy. No!
- Will, let's go.

44:23.470 --> 44:25.165
- No! Damn it!
- You got to!

44:34.682 --> 44:35.979
I know you think I'm crazy...

44:36.183 --> 44:39.050
...but these disasters have to do
with the crystal skull.

44:39.253 --> 44:42.711
- It's like TMTH.
- TM what?

44:42.923 --> 44:45.050
Too much to handle.

44:45.459 --> 44:47.051
Bitch, why you don't just say that?

44:47.261 --> 44:49.923
Why everything a goddamn acronym
with you?

44:50.130 --> 44:53.122
Chilly Willy out, LL Not Cool J.

44:53.334 --> 44:57.202
Oh, do stop all of this quarreling.
Honestly.

44:57.404 --> 44:59.964
Now, who's hungry?

45:08.449 --> 45:09.814
Delicious.

45:10.651 --> 45:12.414
Whatever.

45:13.787 --> 45:14.947
Would you like some?

45:15.422 --> 45:16.446
No.

45:23.630 --> 45:25.154
What?

45:25.733 --> 45:28.463
Y'all, that's my <i>Get Smart</i> phone.
Just give me a minute.

45:37.611 --> 45:39.636
You got poop.

45:40.147 --> 45:41.136
Just a smidge.

45:45.319 --> 45:48.152
Did I get it? Did I get it all?

45:49.757 --> 45:51.622
What y'all looking at me like that for?

45:51.825 --> 45:53.349
You got... Yeah.

45:53.961 --> 45:54.950
Is it right there?

45:55.796 --> 45:58.287
- It's fine.
- Just go:

45:58.665 --> 46:01.031
Just... I get it all the time, all over.

46:05.806 --> 46:07.433
What it do?

46:10.444 --> 46:13.936
Hey, y'all, it's Lisa's mom.

46:14.481 --> 46:16.972
I gotta tell her what happened
to her daughter.

46:21.955 --> 46:23.650
Hi, Miss Heller.

46:28.128 --> 46:29.618
Lisa...

46:30.130 --> 46:31.722
Lisa dead.

46:34.201 --> 46:35.566
But booyah!

46:36.570 --> 46:40.006
I met this fine, hot
enchanted-princess chick...

46:40.207 --> 46:43.699
...willing to do anything
and everything I want.

46:43.911 --> 46:46.038
You gotta talk to her. Talk to her.

46:46.280 --> 46:50.774
Hello? Oh, yes, he's right.
I will do anything. Truly.

46:50.984 --> 46:54.283
I'm not referred to on the street
as the Cavernous Princess for nothing.

46:54.488 --> 46:57.548
A nomenclature well-deserved,
most assuredly.

46:57.758 --> 47:00.158
If you've got 5 bucks or some meth,
I'll show you.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.658
One time I hooked up
with a 100-year-old wizard.

47:02.863 --> 47:06.492
His penis kept reappearing
in all sorts of different places.

47:06.700 --> 47:08.190
Never again.

47:08.402 --> 47:11.565
You're so cool.
We should totally hang out.

47:11.772 --> 47:13.569
<i>She's awesome.</i>

47:13.774 --> 47:15.935
Look, we gotta get to Amy
at the Natural History Museum.

47:20.314 --> 47:21.338
Oh, my.

47:21.782 --> 47:24.683
- Oh, no.
- I can't see anything.

47:24.918 --> 47:28.820
- Neither can I.
- Somebody is totally feeling me up.

47:29.022 --> 47:31.252
- Calvin.
- I didn't do it.

47:34.094 --> 47:36.927
They're so perky.
They're filled with milk.

47:39.433 --> 47:41.401
What the hell was that?

48:27.414 --> 48:31.145
Wonderful.
What adorable woodland creatures.

48:31.351 --> 48:34.843
I'm not merry, really. That didn't...
I mean, that didn't make me merry.

48:35.055 --> 48:38.081
I don't feel merry, I guess.

49:14.228 --> 49:15.559
Man, them guys are all right.

49:16.163 --> 49:17.790
That's cute. That's cute.

49:52.633 --> 49:56.694
Okay, you guys are not
Alvin and the Chipmunks, are you?

49:59.306 --> 50:00.671
I think that one's got rabies.

50:05.612 --> 50:07.307
Where you going, punk-ass?

50:10.484 --> 50:12.748
Alvin!

50:18.659 --> 50:20.354
Get him off!

50:20.560 --> 50:22.528
Chipmunks love nuts.

50:27.834 --> 50:31.201
Get him off! What the hell?
I thought you was my friend!

50:31.872 --> 50:32.861
Salty.

50:38.645 --> 50:41.637
You're hitting the wrong thing! You...!

50:48.255 --> 50:52.385
I feel left out.
No one's biting my flesh. Pooh.

50:56.697 --> 50:58.562
Is that the best you got, pussy?

51:02.536 --> 51:03.628
You are such a girl.

51:19.219 --> 51:20.914
Redrum!

51:30.797 --> 51:32.594
Where'd he go?

51:41.074 --> 51:42.200
Yeah!

51:45.645 --> 51:47.442
Don't bite me. Get lost!

51:56.323 --> 51:58.484
Oh, boy, tasty vertebrae.

51:59.493 --> 52:00.721
- Juney.
- Let her go.

52:00.927 --> 52:02.792
Let her go, man.
Ain't nothing we can do.

52:02.996 --> 52:04.361
But she's still alive.

52:04.564 --> 52:05.929
They're munching me harder...

52:06.133 --> 52:10.331
...than Rachael Ray chowing down
eggs Benedict on <i>$40 a Day.</i>

52:10.537 --> 52:11.561
Yeah.

52:11.772 --> 52:16.141
Even when the bitch is dying,
she don't shut up with her witty repartee.

52:16.343 --> 52:20.040
Hey, BFFs, what's the 411 on the 911?

52:20.247 --> 52:22.545
Oh, she is rather annoying.

52:22.749 --> 52:26.742
WTH? I'm so not ROTFLOL'ing...

52:26.953 --> 52:32.050
...but please KIT, before I get 187'd.

52:33.326 --> 52:35.226
Blog you later.

52:36.363 --> 52:38.228
- Finally.
- Finally.

52:38.965 --> 52:41.695
That was just the amuse bouche.
Now the main course.

52:46.039 --> 52:48.405
- Come back here, you bitches.
- Bitches!

52:48.608 --> 52:50.667
I'll get you in your grill.

52:50.877 --> 52:52.401
Pussies.

52:52.612 --> 52:53.670
Die!

52:53.880 --> 52:57.281
Can't breathe. Need air.

52:59.286 --> 53:00.844
Shitheads!

53:08.061 --> 53:10.188
Is everybody okay?

53:10.397 --> 53:12.092
Yeah, I'm okay.

53:12.299 --> 53:15.860
Hey, baby, your knees
are all skinned up.

53:16.670 --> 53:19.230
Oh, yes, but that's not
from the chipmunks.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.972
But I do have this terrible headache.

53:24.644 --> 53:27.112
<i>Head On.</i>
<i>Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

53:27.314 --> 53:29.748
<i>Head On.</i>
<i>Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

53:29.950 --> 53:32.418
<i>Head On.</i>
<i>Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

53:32.619 --> 53:34.746
<i>Head On.</i>
<i>Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

53:34.955 --> 53:36.718
I just... I just did.

53:36.923 --> 53:38.390
<i>I said, Head On, bitch.</i>

53:38.592 --> 53:40.560
- <i>Apply directly to the forehead.</i>
- Whatever.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.250
<i>Don't cop an attitude, slut.</i>

53:42.462 --> 53:46.023
<i>I said, apply Head On directly</i>
<i>to your goddamn forehead.</i>

53:46.233 --> 53:49.100
Okay, okay. Happy?

53:49.302 --> 53:51.327
<i>Look, you little white-trash</i>
<i>piece of shit...</i>

53:51.538 --> 53:52.698
<i>... Head On, motherfucker.</i>

53:52.906 --> 53:55.636
<i>Apply directly to your</i>
<i>motherfucking forehead.</i>

53:55.842 --> 53:58.936
Okay? There. It's all over.

53:59.145 --> 54:03.741
Head on, face on, nose on, eyes on.

54:05.852 --> 54:07.581
Oh, that's great.

54:07.787 --> 54:09.152
My headache is gone...

54:09.356 --> 54:12.450
...but I still have that dreadful
yeast infection.

54:13.793 --> 54:15.192
Sourdough anyone?

54:15.962 --> 54:18.760
- I could've did without that.
- Let's get to the museum.

54:23.336 --> 54:25.531
- Let's go!
- Move it!

54:25.739 --> 54:27.707
Out of the way!

54:36.182 --> 54:37.774
Excuse me, sir.

54:37.984 --> 54:40.009
What's going on?
Where's everybody going?

54:40.220 --> 54:43.348
It's a mass evacuation. Everyone
has to leave the city right now.

54:43.557 --> 54:45.320
Hold up, hold up.
You leaving, Batman?

54:45.525 --> 54:49.359
Shit. Yes. Yeah, I'm leaving. Okay?
I don't wanna die.

54:49.563 --> 54:51.656
Not on my schedule today.
Not on my to-do list.

54:51.865 --> 54:55.198
It wasn't, "Wake up, make breakfast, jog,
science experiment, die."

54:55.402 --> 54:59.395
Not on it. Not on it. Okay?
Are we done?

54:59.606 --> 55:00.971
All right.

55:01.641 --> 55:04.474
Anyone who stays in town
is gonna be buried in rubble.

55:04.678 --> 55:05.804
I hate rubble.

55:06.012 --> 55:09.675
I've gotta get to the Natural History
Museum, to my girl, Amy. She's trapped.

55:09.883 --> 55:13.319
If you go back after your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

55:13.620 --> 55:14.814
I'll take those odds.

55:17.691 --> 55:21.525
- She must be some piece of pussy.
- She is, sir. She is.

55:23.029 --> 55:26.328
Look, the evacuation bus
is leaving city hall at 2100 hours.

55:26.533 --> 55:29.297
Twenty-one hundred?
Hold on, what is...? That's...

55:29.502 --> 55:31.663
- Five, carry the six...
- Nine p.m.

55:31.871 --> 55:34.533
I'm gonna save you your crazy math.
It's 9 p.m.

55:34.741 --> 55:37.039
You start at noon, then nine hours later.

55:37.243 --> 55:40.542
That's 9. That's the time you need
to get on those evacuation buses...

55:40.747 --> 55:42.237
...or you're dead.

55:42.449 --> 55:43.916
Dead?

55:45.251 --> 55:47.412
Come on, it's already 5:30.

55:48.221 --> 55:50.553
Say again, 5:30? Oh, Jesus.

55:50.757 --> 55:53.282
Oh, God. I wasted the whole day.

55:53.493 --> 55:56.758
I was... I was on Amazon
looking for stuff.

55:56.963 --> 56:00.296
Shit. Why? Why would I
go Christmas shopping today?

56:00.967 --> 56:04.801
Why would I pick today?
Son of a bitch. Okay, plan B.

56:09.643 --> 56:10.974
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:11.177 --> 56:12.201
I'm Batman.

56:12.412 --> 56:14.209
I'm Enchanted Princess.

56:14.414 --> 56:17.008
True story: I had a woman one time...

56:17.217 --> 56:21.483
...tell me I was in the top four
best lovers she's ever had.

56:21.688 --> 56:23.087
That's a true story.

56:23.289 --> 56:24.916
And she had been around the block.

56:27.460 --> 56:31.556
Would you want to watch me
play with myself?

56:33.199 --> 56:34.188
Goodbye.

56:45.779 --> 56:47.269
Come on, let's go.

56:50.483 --> 56:51.780
Break yourself, fool.

56:51.985 --> 56:55.079
You best be getting out of that Mach 5
or I'll toe-tag your ass.

57:04.130 --> 57:06.325
You know, they say that the first kill...

57:06.533 --> 57:08.330
...is supposed to be quite difficult.

57:08.535 --> 57:12.198
But I find it easy. In fact, rather fun.

57:13.173 --> 57:15.971
Take it. Do it.

57:21.514 --> 57:23.243
Look, Ma, no eyes.

57:23.450 --> 57:24.974
I didn't have a mother!

57:28.722 --> 57:31.691
That was better than sex with a camel.

57:43.136 --> 57:46.162
What? We're just playing
with my monkey.

57:50.777 --> 57:52.335
Let's roll.

57:55.849 --> 57:56.975
Oh, my!

58:09.229 --> 58:10.218
Come on!

58:12.565 --> 58:13.896
Run.

58:15.602 --> 58:17.399
We gotta keep going.

58:19.038 --> 58:21.905
These glass slippers
are awfully hard to run in.

58:30.083 --> 58:31.744
Help. Help.

58:32.552 --> 58:33.849
Amy.

58:35.955 --> 58:38.219
- You came back for me.
- I love you, Amy.

58:38.892 --> 58:41.793
I know. I love you too.

58:43.463 --> 58:45.761
Now get this freaking spear
out of my shoulder.

58:45.965 --> 58:46.954
Yeah.

58:47.901 --> 58:49.232
- Okay.
- It hurts.

58:49.435 --> 58:50.595
Okay. All right.

58:50.804 --> 58:52.795
She's pinned through to the floor, guys.

58:53.006 --> 58:55.770
This isn't gonna be easy.
Calvin, I'm gonna need your help.

58:55.975 --> 58:57.602
Right.

59:02.248 --> 59:05.183
- What was that for?
- I was trying to knock her unconscious...

59:05.385 --> 59:06.750
...so she wouldn't feel pain.

59:08.021 --> 59:09.648
Good thinking.

59:10.256 --> 59:13.623
- Baby, this is for your own good.
- Okay.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.300
Man, you hit like a pussy. Let me try.

59:32.946 --> 59:34.607
Man, this girl can take a hit.

59:43.656 --> 59:45.419
Why?

59:46.960 --> 59:49.360
It's not working.
Let's just pull it out of her.

59:51.064 --> 59:52.053
On the count of three.

59:52.265 --> 59:54.699
One, two, three.

59:54.901 --> 59:56.334
Good job.

01:00:08.181 --> 01:00:10.775
We gotta get out of here.
This place is gonna collapse.

01:00:11.351 --> 01:00:16.812
No. Not until we return this...

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:19.314
...back to the altar.

01:00:19.826 --> 01:00:21.555
A magic bong.

01:00:21.761 --> 01:00:24.594
The crystal skull.
The one from my dreams.

01:00:24.797 --> 01:00:29.200
Now, legend has it that if the
crystal skull is missing from the altar...

01:00:29.402 --> 01:00:31.563
...it's the end of the world.
Earthquakes...

01:00:31.771 --> 01:00:34.296
...asteroids, return of the Spice Girls.

01:00:34.507 --> 01:00:35.633
Yes!

01:00:37.243 --> 01:00:38.232
The apocalypse.

01:00:38.444 --> 01:00:40.969
And you know this shit
because you're the docent?

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.842
I saw <i>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom</i>
<i>of the Crystal Skull.</i>

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:45.642
Do you know what this means?

01:00:45.852 --> 01:00:48.719
Me dreaming about the skull,
and you knowing about the skull?

01:00:48.922 --> 01:00:52.517
- That we were destined to be together?
- No, that we both really love skulls.

01:00:53.626 --> 01:00:55.321
But that too.

01:00:56.963 --> 01:00:59.488
Will, we gotta get out of here.
It's almost 9:00.

01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:02.896
If we don't make it to them
evacuation buses, we're gonna die.

01:01:05.204 --> 01:01:06.603
Go, Calvin.

01:01:06.806 --> 01:01:09.832
I'm staying here with Amy.
We're returning the skull to the altar.

01:01:11.778 --> 01:01:13.439
- See you.
- Nice meeting you.

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.073
Let's find that altar.

01:01:44.077 --> 01:01:45.066
What's happening?

01:01:45.278 --> 01:01:48.543
Everything in the museum
is coming to life.

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:52.777
Hell, no!

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.248
Bully! Bully!

01:01:56.823 --> 01:01:57.983
Yes!

01:02:01.894 --> 01:02:04.624
- Let's get the hell up out of here.
- Drugs are great.

01:02:09.202 --> 01:02:12.171
- The altar to the crystal skull is this way.
- Okay.

01:02:18.344 --> 01:02:20.107
I am Beowulf.

01:02:24.817 --> 01:02:26.011
Hello.

01:02:28.688 --> 01:02:29.950
What?

01:02:31.224 --> 01:02:32.486
I am Beowulf.

01:02:34.227 --> 01:02:36.627
- Can you put some clothes on?
- I am Beowulf.

01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:40.663
I fought the monster Grendel with
no armor, and that is how I'll fight you.

01:02:41.567 --> 01:02:43.034
Wait. You fight naked?

01:02:46.105 --> 01:02:47.094
I am Beowulf.

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:48.500
That's kind of gay, bro.

01:02:49.008 --> 01:02:50.976
It's not... It's not gay. It's...

01:02:51.177 --> 01:02:53.111
No, I'm sorry. That's gay.

01:02:53.312 --> 01:02:55.143
It's not gay. It's not.

01:02:55.348 --> 01:02:58.977
It's how we do it in 507, dick.

01:02:59.185 --> 01:03:02.052
- Ask anybody.
- All right, I will. I'll ask my friend Paul.

01:03:02.255 --> 01:03:05.383
We're boating tomorrow.
I'll ask him when we're out in the seas.

01:03:06.025 --> 01:03:09.358
- Paul?
- My friend Paul, who is my partner.

01:03:10.897 --> 01:03:13.388
He's my friend. We're also partners.

01:03:14.434 --> 01:03:17.164
- Life partner?
- No, business partners.

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:20.203
We opened an antique shop together.

01:03:20.406 --> 01:03:22.169
- That's gay.
- Why is that gay?

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:25.742
Why are antiques gay? Because
I like old things that are kitschy?

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.709
I'm Beowulf!

01:03:30.149 --> 01:03:33.482
Excuse me, are you ready
to get your ass kicked?

01:03:39.826 --> 01:03:43.694
Oh, hell, no, Kung Fu Panda.

01:03:44.397 --> 01:03:46.888
You shouldn't have done that.

01:03:52.939 --> 01:03:55.533
Get ready to feel the thunder.

01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:25.801
Your girl looks familiar, man.

01:04:26.005 --> 01:04:30.704
Last year, I paid her 20 bucks
for 20 minutes, if you know what I mean.

01:04:31.043 --> 01:04:33.603
It's true. And a curious factoid:

01:04:33.813 --> 01:04:37.044
Pandas actually have
three descending testicles.

01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:40.409
That's it.

01:05:33.272 --> 01:05:34.637
Oh, shit.

01:05:42.582 --> 01:05:44.709
Oh, wonderful job.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:52.651
<i>My dear prince</i>
<i>You have defended my honor</i>

01:05:53.559 --> 01:05:55.254
Kiss me, baby.

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:21.586
- You a dude?
- I'm a trannie. I thought you knew.

01:06:22.788 --> 01:06:24.255
No.

01:06:35.268 --> 01:06:36.496
Get him, Will.

01:06:37.303 --> 01:06:39.771
- I am Beowulf.
- Yeah, I know already.

01:06:39.972 --> 01:06:42.532
Surrender so we can go get brunch.

01:06:42.742 --> 01:06:46.007
And I got us tickets to <i>Jersey Boys.</i>

01:06:46.245 --> 01:06:47.769
No.

01:06:59.925 --> 01:07:01.119
We can go to my place.

01:07:01.327 --> 01:07:05.161
I TiVo'd <i>Dancing with the Stars,</i>
results show.

01:07:05.364 --> 01:07:07.229
- No!
- Beowulf!

01:07:09.101 --> 01:07:11.797
I wanna take you
on Rosie O'Donnell's cruise.

01:07:12.004 --> 01:07:15.462
Just me, you,
and my dear friend George Takei.

01:07:15.975 --> 01:07:17.465
Screw this.

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:20.208
I'm Beowulf!

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.210
Beowulf out.

01:07:27.887 --> 01:07:29.445
Hurry, we're running out of time.

01:08:01.554 --> 01:08:03.146
Indiana Jones?

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:07.524
Indiana, my ass.

01:08:09.261 --> 01:08:10.489
I'll take it from here.

01:08:17.002 --> 01:08:20.438
Thanks, son.
That's right, I'm your father.

01:08:22.575 --> 01:08:25.544
- You're my dad?
- Your mom got around.

01:08:25.745 --> 01:08:28.612
- A real slut, actually.
- Right, I get it.

01:08:28.814 --> 01:08:30.304
She did this special thing...

01:08:30.515 --> 01:08:34.542
...with her big toe and candle wax...
- Okay.

01:08:34.754 --> 01:08:36.846
I'm sorry I walked out
on you and your mother.

01:08:37.055 --> 01:08:38.956
But I got an adventurous spirit...

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:41.854
...and a hot-ass whore
in every major city.

01:08:43.496 --> 01:08:45.020
What do we have here?

01:08:45.231 --> 01:08:46.698
Is this your girl?

01:08:46.899 --> 01:08:50.130
- Yeah.
- What a nice young lady.

01:08:50.336 --> 01:08:52.133
And you got some shape on you.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:54.670
Yeah, baby. You're so nice.

01:08:54.874 --> 01:08:58.173
- And you got some ass on you.
- Dad.

01:08:58.377 --> 01:09:00.537
- Oh, so beautiful.
- Dad.

01:09:00.746 --> 01:09:04.648
If a nice ass meant a hamburger,
baby, you'd have a Whopper.

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:06.249
- Oh, shit.
- Dad.

01:09:06.452 --> 01:09:10.183
Do you do Pilates?
I'm just asking. Just asking.

01:09:13.658 --> 01:09:16.560
Don't do what your old man did.
Settle down.

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:19.995
Hell, I got gonorrhea so many times...

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:22.258
...my johnson looked like a melted
Baby Ruth.

01:09:23.736 --> 01:09:27.331
Hell, in the '70s, my nickname was
Chlamydia Jones.

01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:32.871
There is no cure for herpes,
and I bullshit you not.

01:09:33.679 --> 01:09:35.408
Thanks, Dad.

01:09:57.736 --> 01:10:00.569
- This looks easy.
- Not as easy as it used to be.

01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:07.142
Oh, shit, my hip.

01:10:12.284 --> 01:10:15.276
- You know I gotta get my hustle on.
- Bye, Dad.

01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:18.850
I'm gonna make it.

01:10:19.058 --> 01:10:20.650
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.122
Oh, shit!

01:10:25.231 --> 01:10:28.064
That hurts. Oh, shit!

01:10:55.394 --> 01:11:00.525
Why don't you just walk to the altar?
It's like 10 feet away.

01:11:01.534 --> 01:11:03.365
Silly girl.

01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:13.803
No, don't cry. I'll be fine.

01:12:00.659 --> 01:12:02.320
I am the Guru Shitka.

01:12:02.528 --> 01:12:06.157
And we are here today
to bring together Amy and Will...

01:12:06.365 --> 01:12:09.300
...in a union of peace and happiness.

01:12:09.501 --> 01:12:15.337
And to point out, gee,
Amy, you are totally hot. TM.

01:12:17.376 --> 01:12:18.934
Amy, do you take Will...

01:12:19.144 --> 01:12:22.841
...to be your peanut butter and jelly
that goes into your love belly?

01:12:23.048 --> 01:12:24.072
I do.

01:12:24.283 --> 01:12:28.686
And, Will, do you take Amy
to be your doughnut of love...

01:12:28.887 --> 01:12:31.879
...that you'll fill with cream every day?

01:12:32.091 --> 01:12:33.080
I do.

01:12:36.295 --> 01:12:39.594
Well, in that case, give her a pound.

01:12:40.532 --> 01:12:42.625
Lock it down.

01:12:43.002 --> 01:12:44.867
Break the pickle.

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:46.430
Now, tickle my pickle.

01:12:55.714 --> 01:12:56.703
I love you, Will.

01:12:56.915 --> 01:12:58.974
I love you too, Amy.

01:12:59.284 --> 01:13:01.718
But there's something I should tell you.

01:13:02.821 --> 01:13:03.810
What is it?

01:13:16.602 --> 01:13:17.830
<i>I'm fucking Matt Damon</i>

01:13:18.504 --> 01:13:20.836
You're fucking Matt Damon?

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.564
<i>Well, I'm fucking Hannah Montana</i>

01:13:22.775 --> 01:13:24.174
<i>She's fucking Hannah Montana</i>

01:13:24.376 --> 01:13:27.971
<i>Backstage at my concert</i>
<i>Fucks me on my parents' bed</i>

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:31.240
<i>After school, at my locker,</i>
<i>In the car I give her head</i>

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:32.974
<i>I'm also fucking the Flava</i>

01:13:33.185 --> 01:13:35.653
<i>Yeah, boy</i>
<i>She's fucking Flava-Flav, fool</i>

01:13:35.854 --> 01:13:38.652
<i>You know what time it is</i>
<i>Because I'm fucking Juney too</i>

01:13:39.725 --> 01:13:43.161
<i>Yeah, I know, but it's true</i>
<i>Flava-Flav, he fucks me too</i>

01:13:43.362 --> 01:13:46.627
<i>And I swap with Calvin</i>
<i>And he swaps with that dude</i>

01:13:46.832 --> 01:13:48.265
<i>And we're all fucking Hellboy</i>

01:13:49.034 --> 01:13:54.802
<i>Yeah, they're fucking Hellboy</i>
<i>And I'm fucking the Hulk</i>

01:13:55.007 --> 01:13:58.374
<i>When I get really mad</i>
<i>I start fucking Iron Man</i>

01:13:58.577 --> 01:14:01.774
<i>A most uncomfortable screw</i>
<i>But I fuck the princess too</i>

01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:05.347
<i>Who's that ringing on my bell?</i>

01:14:05.551 --> 01:14:07.314
<i>The bitch who's fucking Iron Man</i>

01:14:07.519 --> 01:14:12.286
<i>That's l-R-O-N M-A-N</i>
<i>And I fuck him in the mouth</i>

01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:15.983
<i>That's fucking great</i>
<i>Because I'm fucking Wolf</i>

01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:20.091
<i>He's fucking Wolf</i>
<i>Ain't that a pity?</i>

01:14:20.299 --> 01:14:23.632
<i>Because I'm fucking those bitches</i>
<i>From</i> Sex and the City

01:14:25.037 --> 01:14:28.006
<i>He fucks the</i> Sex and the City <i>gals</i>

01:14:28.207 --> 01:14:31.005
So I wondered:
Would Wolf really get jealous...

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:34.202
...if he knew we were fucking
that guy with the big utility belt?

01:14:35.814 --> 01:14:37.042
<i>They're all fucking Batman</i>

01:14:37.249 --> 01:14:40.446
<i>At Wayne Manor, in the Batcave</i>
<i>Butler Alfred is our love slave</i>

01:14:40.652 --> 01:14:42.347
<i>Riddle me this</i>
<i>Holy bathhouse</i>

01:14:42.554 --> 01:14:44.044
<i>I'm fucking Amy Winehouse?</i>

01:14:44.256 --> 01:14:47.555
<i>He's fucking Amy Winehouse</i>

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.354
<i>Yeah, on the down-low, low, low</i>

01:14:50.562 --> 01:14:53.497
<i>And I'm fucking Jessica Simpson</i>

01:14:54.233 --> 01:14:57.396
<i>'Cause I'm on blow, blow, blow</i>

01:14:57.603 --> 01:15:01.562
<i>She's fucking Jessica Simpson</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:15:01.774 --> 01:15:05.801
<i>And I think I might have fucked</i>
<i>That hot assassin</i>

01:15:06.011 --> 01:15:09.174
<i>Everyone's fucked me</i>
<i>And I've fucked them back, you see</i>

01:15:09.381 --> 01:15:12.714
<i>And the Mexican too</i>
<i>With the tragic hairdo</i>

01:15:13.152 --> 01:15:16.087
<i>Call it, heads, I'm fucking J. T.</i>

01:15:16.288 --> 01:15:19.223
<i>I'm fucking that male model</i>
<i>'Cause he's so fine</i>

01:15:19.424 --> 01:15:22.552
<i>And I like to get up</i>
<i>In them Calvin Kleins</i>

01:15:22.761 --> 01:15:29.132
<i>It's true, J. T. fucked my ass again</i>
<i>But I'm also fucking Prince Caspian</i>

01:15:29.668 --> 01:15:32.865
<i>I am handsome and I am cool</i>

01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:36.268
<i>That's why this prince</i>
<i>Fucks the kids from high school</i>

01:15:40.145 --> 01:15:41.635
- <i>Come on</i>
- <i>Let's hear it</i>

01:15:41.847 --> 01:15:43.781
- <i>Now's the time to party</i>
- <i>Let me hear you</i>

01:15:43.982 --> 01:15:46.143
- <i>You know what time it is?</i>
- <i>No, what time is it?</i>

01:15:46.351 --> 01:15:48.285
- <i>It's time to get fucked</i>
- <i>Fuck me</i>

01:15:48.487 --> 01:15:50.546
- <i>No, fuck me</i>
- <i>Fuck me</i>

01:15:50.756 --> 01:15:52.690
<i>He fucks all us kids in high school</i>

01:15:52.891 --> 01:15:56.827
<i>Under the bleachers, in the showers</i>
<i>While we're changing for gym class</i>

01:15:57.029 --> 01:15:58.860
- <i>I'm fucking Oprah</i>
- <i>I'm fucking Obama</i>

01:15:59.064 --> 01:16:01.157
<i>I'm fucking Indiana's ass</i>

01:16:01.366 --> 01:16:05.325
<i>She's fucking Indiana</i>
<i>And I'm fucking Hancock</i>

01:16:05.537 --> 01:16:09.098
<i>He's fucking Hancock</i>
<i>And I'm fucking Beowulf</i>

01:16:09.308 --> 01:16:12.766
<i>You know you like it</i>
<i>And I'm fucking Kung Fu Panda</i>

01:16:12.978 --> 01:16:15.469
<i>And I'm fucking Michael Jackson</i>

01:16:16.882 --> 01:16:19.908
<i>Don't judge me</i>
<i>I love my animals, you see</i>

01:16:20.118 --> 01:16:21.847
<i>Oh, yeah, he's fucking the Chipmunks</i>

01:16:22.054 --> 01:16:25.615
<i>Sad to say, but it's true</i>
<i>He fucks the Chipmunks, yeah</i>

01:18:51.837 --> 01:18:53.464
You just got Wolfed.

01:18:53.672 --> 01:18:56.573
That's a little move I learned in jail.

01:18:56.775 --> 01:18:58.174
Yeah, I was in jail.

01:18:58.377 --> 01:19:00.937
Wolf wrote some bad checks in '95.

01:19:01.146 --> 01:19:03.273
Left foot, yellow.

01:19:04.616 --> 01:19:05.981
Oh, that's right, I fall.

01:19:11.957 --> 01:19:14.983
Sorry about that. This is mine.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:19.960
Wait. Oh, this is my jam.

01:19:20.165 --> 01:19:22.725
Oh, okay. You get on it.

01:19:23.168 --> 01:19:24.430
I am Beowulf.

01:19:24.636 --> 01:19:28.231
I'm the strongest man
in seven kingdoms.

01:19:30.008 --> 01:19:32.533
Let myself go a little bit.

01:19:32.744 --> 01:19:34.609
Got a little bit flabby.

01:19:34.813 --> 01:19:36.713
I went on that Zone Diet...

01:19:36.915 --> 01:19:41.682
...but I would eat like a whole week's
worth of meals in like two days...

01:19:41.887 --> 01:19:43.479
...and then be back to square one.

01:19:43.688 --> 01:19:47.715
If you've got crack anywhere,
I don't care where it comes from...

01:19:47.926 --> 01:19:51.384
If it's in your crack...
If the crack's in your crack.

01:19:52.964 --> 01:19:56.229
"If the crack's in your crack."
Oh, that's rich.

01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:58.626
You ever been
with a bald doctor before?

01:19:58.837 --> 01:20:00.930
- No.
- We give better...

01:20:02.974 --> 01:20:05.101
Do I look like Harrison Ford to you?

01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:07.505
- He your pimp?
- Oh, good heavens, yes.

01:20:11.316 --> 01:20:13.682
Oh, what to do? Yes, I've got it.

01:20:13.885 --> 01:20:17.343
You can be my prince of light,
and you can be my prince of darkness.

01:20:17.556 --> 01:20:19.387
- Yes. No? Okay.
- No.

01:20:20.325 --> 01:20:22.452
Left foot, yellow.

01:20:23.895 --> 01:20:25.658
Look at this onion.

01:20:25.864 --> 01:20:29.857
Baby, how did you get into it with him.
You should be with me.

01:20:30.068 --> 01:20:33.936
Also, when I make love to a girl,
she's also been Wolfed.

01:20:34.139 --> 01:20:39.634
I don't hit her with a stick,
I just have sex with her.

01:20:39.845 --> 01:20:41.972
Or him. Doesn't matter.

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:44.375
Wolf goes both ways,
you know what I'm saying?

01:20:44.583 --> 01:20:47.017
I got us tickets
to Madonna's reunion show...

01:20:47.219 --> 01:20:49.414
...and then I wanna
kiss your sweet face.

01:20:49.621 --> 01:20:51.350
No!

01:20:52.557 --> 01:20:54.650
Take it from the top again.
She says, "Hello."

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:57.658
Don't hit her so hard.
Just hit her really lightly.

01:20:57.863 --> 01:20:59.296
Okay?

01:20:59.998 --> 01:21:01.397
Good enough for me.

01:21:03.135 --> 01:21:04.864
It's all very funny.

01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:07.137
Cut.

01:21:07.806 --> 01:21:11.537
Oh, it's my Blake, incarcerated.
Hi, Blakey.

01:21:11.743 --> 01:21:14.143
How are you? I love you.

01:21:14.346 --> 01:21:16.177
He did not kill those three prostitutes.

01:21:16.381 --> 01:21:20.374
They were already dead when he
got to them. I'm swearing to God.

01:21:20.886 --> 01:21:23.912
Look, I have to tell you something.
I'm not really a banker.

01:21:24.122 --> 01:21:25.749
As my voice cracks.

01:21:25.957 --> 01:21:31.020
Look, I have something to tell you.
I'm not really a banker. I'm a jumper.

01:21:31.229 --> 01:21:34.596
I can teleport through space and time.

01:21:37.936 --> 01:21:40.302
- What is it again? Time and space.
- Time and space.

01:21:40.705 --> 01:21:42.297
Look, I have something to tell you.

01:21:42.507 --> 01:21:44.702
I'm not really a banker. I'm a jumper.

01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:47.879
- A what?
- I can teleport through time...

01:21:54.286 --> 01:21:55.617
You're a talking panda.

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:59.347
Come back to my magical kingdom,
and I'll show you my talking beaver.

01:21:59.858 --> 01:22:01.758
It just keeps coming.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:05.794
Knock, knock. Who's there?
Milk in your mouth.

01:22:11.703 --> 01:22:18.541
Hey, is my singing stick on?
It is on? Is the singing stick on?

01:22:21.246 --> 01:22:24.545
You know, everyone wants to know
where I got my:

01:22:24.749 --> 01:22:27.809
It all started one night
when I was crying in my truck.

01:22:28.019 --> 01:22:30.920
Yeah. I ain't crying no more, man.

01:22:31.122 --> 01:22:33.113
Fourteenth highest-rated show on TV.

01:22:33.325 --> 01:22:36.226
I got a time-share in Key West.

01:22:36.928 --> 01:22:41.194
<i>Oh, baby, I make shoes</i>

01:22:41.399 --> 01:22:45.267
<i>And these are my boobs</i>

01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:47.700
I want you to see me
in my birthday suit.

01:22:47.906 --> 01:22:50.136
I want you to watch me
take a bubble bath.

01:22:50.342 --> 01:22:53.209
I'm gonna play around with the bubbles
and make a little beard.

01:22:53.411 --> 01:22:55.345
Pretend I'm Santa Claus.

01:22:56.715 --> 01:22:59.411
Oh, son, I'm loving this.

01:22:59.784 --> 01:23:03.220
Hang on a bit.
You're a bit of stuff, aren't you?

01:23:03.421 --> 01:23:06.481
Look at you.
What are you packing under there?

01:23:06.691 --> 01:23:08.215
What are you hiding under that?

01:23:08.426 --> 01:23:11.293
I can see your sausage and biscuits.

01:23:12.631 --> 01:23:14.155
I love sausage and biscuits.

01:23:27.379 --> 01:23:29.176
Wonderful!

01:23:30.248 --> 01:23:32.341
I'd like to get you naked
and analyze you.

01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:34.677
Oh, shit.

01:23:34.886 --> 01:23:37.286
Do you like this shirt?
I totally made it myself.

01:23:37.489 --> 01:23:40.083
Well, it's because I ripped it.
It's because I burned it.

01:23:40.292 --> 01:23:41.987
I was leaning over my birthday candles.

01:23:42.193 --> 01:23:43.922
I was gonna blow them out,
make a wish.

01:23:44.129 --> 01:23:45.756
Instead my shirt caught on fire.

01:23:46.197 --> 01:23:49.894
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

01:23:50.235 --> 01:23:52.203
I'll take those odds.

01:23:53.405 --> 01:23:55.339
Do you hear that train?

01:23:57.709 --> 01:24:01.440
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

01:24:01.646 --> 01:24:03.307
I'll take those odds.

01:24:03.515 --> 01:24:06.712
You hear that train again?
You hear that again, that second time?

01:24:07.118 --> 01:24:10.884
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

01:24:11.323 --> 01:24:12.381
I'll take those...

01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:15.058
Train. I knew it was coming too. Yeah.

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:19.060
- Is that the train we should catch?
- No, no. Take a...

01:24:21.766 --> 01:24:22.755
Couple more?

01:24:22.967 --> 01:24:25.834
You're hot. Are those things real?

01:24:27.839 --> 01:24:32.037
Hey, everybody, be sure to remember
to always use Proactiv. It helped me.

01:24:32.243 --> 01:24:36.907
<i>It helped my skin</i>
<i>It helped my skin</i>

01:24:37.115 --> 01:24:42.781
<i>It helped my skin</i>
<i>It helped my skin, baby</i>

01:24:42.987 --> 01:24:46.354
It helped me. I used to have it
all around this part of my face...

01:24:46.558 --> 01:24:48.355
...and all around my talking hole...

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:52.018
...and then out of this squishy part
right here.

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:54.721
I had it everywhere, and now it's gone.

01:24:54.933 --> 01:25:00.064
There's a medical term
for what you do to me: Horny.
