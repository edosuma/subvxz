00:16.760 --> 00:18.480
You all right, love?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.520
Hey... Hey! Come here.

01:19.520 --> 01:20.880
Look at this!

02:09.199 --> 02:10.600
Ma'am.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.840
Ma'am, this way.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.400
The builders found a body.

02:20.400 --> 02:24.160
- What? 
- The builders, they found the body.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.080
Buried inside this old drainage tunnel.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.440
Been there a while,
by the look of things.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.120
Here you are.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.480
Well, I want this
whole area cordoned off.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.960
And no-one leaves without my say-so.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.720
Oh, you're going to need this.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.880
Health and safety.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.520
Right.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.320
Malcolm? Coming!

02:48.320 --> 02:50.360
Malcolm! I'm coming.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.320
I wondered when you'd join us.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.200
Yeah, get your foot on the bottom
of that ladder. I'm coming down.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.640
Careful.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.360
I don't know exactly
what this tunnel's in aid of.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.080
Yeah, well...

03:05.080 --> 03:08.680
..they were built to drain
water from the mines.

03:08.680 --> 03:12.240
There's plenty of them hidden away.
- Ah.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.600
Well, it can't have been
used for a while, then.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.800
Well, it can't have been
used Oh, you're blinding me.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.320
Sorry.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.320
The body's over here.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.800
What's left of him.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.200
- So what can you tell us?
- Well, not much, really.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.480
Erm, he's male.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.280
Five foot ten. His boots
are still fairly intact.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.200
How long's he been down
here? Well, ten years at least.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.360
He's got quite a distinctive belt buckle.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.000
He's got quite a distinctive Do you see?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.880
What is that, an anchor? Mm.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.640
A sailor. Merchant Navy perhaps.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.000
Or somebody who worked
down at the shipyard.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.960
Oh, he's missing two
fingers of his left hand.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.080
That's probably the local
vermin having a nibble.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.440
Yeah, well, the rats aside,
what was it that killed him?

03:55.440 --> 03:58.200
A blunt trauma injury. He took a
real bash to the back of the skull.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.960
So he's assaulted and his body dumped.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.640
How'd he get down here?

04:03.640 --> 04:06.760
Well, there must be another
access point here somewhere.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.640
Well, get the rest of
this culvert excavated.

04:09.640 --> 04:13.040
Oh, well, you know I love
a challenge. Aye, well...

04:13.040 --> 04:15.000
I'll get the scene locked down.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.600
You'll have the site to yourselves.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.360
Bliss.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.520
- Any idea who it is, then?
- Not yet, love.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.680
This is what happens when
you start cutting corners.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.560
Oh, so you've worked on
the site for a while, then?

04:37.560 --> 04:42.200
Oh, yeah. The gaffer made a
point of hiring us personally.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.120
A safe pair of hands.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.920
Well, we'll need you
to give us a statement.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.360
You can talk to one of my officers.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.720
The site contractor's arrived.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.480
He wants to speak to
whoever's in charge.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.760
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.040
DCI Vera Stanhope.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.320
I take it this is your build.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.680
The foreman called the
office, said they'd found a body.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.280
That tunnel never
showed up on the survey.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.400
Is this any relation to Leonard Sidden?

05:04.600 --> 05:07.760
That'll be me dad. He used
to run a club on this site.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.720
Well, he's been retired
a while now. Ill health.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.320
He became Whitley Bay's
Mr Big back in the day.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.440
- You seem to know him pretty well.
- Oh, aye.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.160
We all did. Made it our business to.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.960
Yeah, the family might've
have had a bad rep.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.320
We've put all that behind us.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.840
I'm just trying to make an honest living.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.160
Well, I'm glad to hear the
Siddens have cleaned up their act.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.680
I can't pay these lads to stand idle.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.120
Well, I can't help that, love.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.080
You'll be digging no more holes
until Forensics have finished.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.200
- I better go and break the bad news.
- Aye, you do that.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.400
Aye, this takes you back, eh, Kenny?

05:45.400 --> 05:47.960
Ha! Had you spent
many a night in there?

05:47.960 --> 05:49.440
The Seagull? Mm.

05:49.440 --> 05:53.080
Not really my scene, ma'am.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.040
Get on to George down in Mispers.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.680
Get him to pull out the
file on Robbie Marshburn.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.280
- Now, there's a ghost from the past.
- Aye.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.560
Well, I'm afraid he might
have come back to haunt us.

06:04.680 --> 06:05.720
Ma'am.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.320
Robbie Marshburn.
Went missing June 1995.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.600
Aw, look at him.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.000
Butter wouldn't melt. A bit
of a thug, by all accounts.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.800
Oh, there'll have been plenty of people

06:26.800 --> 06:28.440
glad to see the back of him, George.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.520
And if this is Marshburn,

06:30.520 --> 06:32.960
it makes me wonder what
else we're going to dig up.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.240
Last seen alive in a
nightclub. Mm, The Seagull.

06:36.240 --> 06:40.040
Plush club in Whitley Bay. I've
never been one for dancing.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.760
Two left feet.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.120
And not 100 yards from
where we found him.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.320
We've got prints up on the PNC.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.760
Ah, not much left of his fingers, George.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.400
His mam reported him missing.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.680
If she's kept hold of any
of his personal effects,

06:56.680 --> 06:58.400
we could send them off for DNA testing.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.560
Is she still with us?

07:02.680 --> 07:04.560
Eleanor Marshburn.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.440
Lives in the same house.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.080
Address in Wallsend.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.840
I never get round to throwing them out.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.880
You thought he might
have been coming home.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.760
Oh, I always knew Robbie was dead.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.880
He'd never have left
me here on me own.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.760
Taken off with no warning!

07:41.160 --> 07:43.640
Now, we found a buckle, love,

07:43.640 --> 07:46.320
quite near to where, erm...

07:48.040 --> 07:51.160
Can I ask you to have a look at it?

07:59.040 --> 08:00.440
Oh...

08:01.760 --> 08:05.040
I bought him that belt
for his 21st birthday.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.000
Well, we knew he
worked at the shipyard.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.680
Burton-Morgan. Like his dad before him.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.480
The river was in his blood.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.800
Now, can I take you back to
the night he went missing?

08:17.800 --> 08:19.600
Oh, they were...

08:20.840 --> 08:23.480
..they were throwing a party.

08:23.480 --> 08:26.280
Leonard Sidden's birthday.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.040
Must have been his 50th, I suppose.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.799
And our Robbie had to
do all the arrangements.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.880
Important people to impress.
Everything had to be just right.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.440
Well, we know your son spent
some time in a Young Offenders.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.919
Robbie wasn't a bad boy, not the
person they made him out to be.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.000
Well...

08:49.000 --> 08:52.360
..at least now I can mourn him.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.320
Male adult.

09:21.320 --> 09:24.800
His remains were found this
morning on the links at Whitley Bay.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.880
The victim of a violent assault

09:26.880 --> 09:28.520
and we're working on the hunch

09:28.520 --> 09:32.360
that this is a fella
called Robbie Marshburn.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.680
Reported missing 25th June, 1995.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.720
Say we assume he was murdered
around about the time he disappeared.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.720
By my reckoning, that's 23 years.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.480
The last known sighting was
at a club called The Seagull.

09:46.480 --> 09:50.600
And what's left of it stands on the
site where these remains were found.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.880
Yeah, I remember Robbie Marshburn

09:52.880 --> 09:55.080
from my days on the beat in Wallsend.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.920
Must be going back a bit, Kenny.
He was an old-school union man.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.320
Robbie and his heavies
virtually ran the port.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.640
Oh, he was running a racket.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.800
Which brings me to Leonard Sidden.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.560
Now, he owned this club
back in its glory days.

10:09.560 --> 10:13.400
Sidden fancied himself
as a bit of a gangster.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.000
Got chased out of the East
End of London and set up here.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.400
And he used this club as a front
for all kinds of shenanigans.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.760
But nothing ever stuck.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.200
Always came up squeaky clean.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.600
So Robbie and Sidden
were working together?

10:27.600 --> 10:30.880
Now, Robbie was Sidden's fixer.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.720
He used his contacts on the
river to make them both money.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.480
This is the club that caught fire,
then? Aye, completely gutted.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.280
Suspected arson.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.320
I mean, it had to be an insurance job.

10:41.320 --> 10:44.760
What makes you so sure? Well,
Leonard Sidden, that's what.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.520
He's a devious piece of work.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.040
The old man must be
getting on now, eh?

10:49.040 --> 10:51.040
It's the son running things now, isn't it?

10:51.040 --> 10:53.600
Aye. Sidden Holdings.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.800
And they've diversified into property.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.400
I mean, there's developments
down on the seafront.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.880
I've been looking through
the builders' statements

11:00.880 --> 11:03.440
from the site, ma'am.
Nothing we can work with.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.560
Although, according to the log sheet,

11:05.560 --> 11:08.560
one of them left without giving
our officers a formal statement.

11:08.560 --> 11:11.080
Scott Keane. Right.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.040
Well, one of you follow that up.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.720
Jac...

11:14.720 --> 11:17.000
You're opening up a cold case,

11:17.000 --> 11:18.320
after 23 years?

11:18.320 --> 11:20.920
Yes, you're dead right I am!

11:20.920 --> 11:23.200
Marshburn might've been a reprobate,

11:23.200 --> 11:25.400
but I'm still going to
find out who killed him.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.720
And my money is on the Siddens.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.920
Mr Keane?

11:59.240 --> 12:00.960
Mr Keane?

12:57.680 --> 13:00.120
The front door was open. I
should have called for backup.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.000
Yeah, well, you weren't to
know you were going to find this.

13:07.240 --> 13:09.440
He was there yesterday
asking questions.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.120
He was there yesterday Said
he was mates with the gaffer.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.840
Well, someone hit him with that
doorstop. It's been wiped clean.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.720
This wasn't premeditated.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.760
Grabbed whatever was close at hand.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.480
He might have disturbed a burglar.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.360
Well, there's no sign of a forced entry.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.360
Anyway, his wallet's still here.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.240
And his laptop.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.040
Let's get that checked out.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.920
- What about his mobile?
- We still haven't found one.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.760
Well, pull out his phone records.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.240
Let's see if that can tell us anything.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.600
None of the neighbours
saw anything unusual.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.120
What about CCTV? There's a
couple of cameras on the railway.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.160
We'll need to go through those tapes.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.200
He'd only been here a few weeks.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.560
Kept himself to himself, by all accounts.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.440
Well, he's wearing a wedding ring.

14:13.440 --> 14:16.720
So there's gotta be a wife somewhere.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.840
A couple of kids as well.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.760
I take it you and your
husband were separated.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.720
We'd been living apart for a while.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.240
If you don't mind me asking, love,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.680
did your husband walk out
or did you send him packing?

14:35.680 --> 14:38.360
It was my decision.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.440
Any reasons we should know about?

14:41.440 --> 14:42.960
Scott had a bit of a drink problem.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.800
It got him sacked from his last job.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.960
He'd barely worked since.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.080
Er...

14:52.520 --> 14:55.680
So, how was he
spending his spare time?

14:55.680 --> 14:57.120
Down the pub?

14:58.360 --> 15:00.760
He'd fallen in with a few local radgies.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.880
Pubs and clubs on the Farrow Road.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.440
Look, you know what it's like. Oh, aye.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.800
Well, maybe one of these
radgies had it in for him.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.040
No.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.760
Scott was harmless.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.560
A bit of a chancer, that's all.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.000
Well...

15:21.000 --> 15:23.960
..he got himself a job in
the end, though, didn't he?

15:23.960 --> 15:26.320
This contract down at the building site.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.480
This contract No, that was down to me.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.560
I knew the Siddens were hiring.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.320
So I got in touch.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.360
You know the Siddens, then?

15:34.360 --> 15:36.760
Aye. Plenty of people do.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.200
In a minute, love.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.600
Mammy's talking.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.120
Hey, you shouldn't
be on your own, love.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.080
Not at a time like this. I'll be fine.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.040
We can get Victim Support
to send someone over.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.200
I don't need them sticking
their noses in! Yeah, OK.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.640
All right.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.680
Well, what about family?
Your mam, your dad?

15:59.680 --> 16:02.040
Mam's dead. Dad's not around much.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.040
Mam's dead. Well,
could you not call him?

16:04.040 --> 16:05.840
He's in prison.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.240
And what's he in for, if
you don't mind me asking?

16:11.240 --> 16:12.840
I thought you would have known.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.680
Corruption. He's one of your lot.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.040
He used to be a copper. John Brace.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.320
Vera Stanhope.

16:37.320 --> 16:41.080
I think we should keep
things formal, don't you?

16:42.280 --> 16:43.720
It's DCI Stanhope now.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.080
And this is my colleague, DS Healy.

16:47.160 --> 16:51.240
Detective Inspector John Brace,
as we're keeping things formal.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.920
Ex.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.600
I don't get many visitors.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.160
People give bent coppers
a wide berth in here.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.480
We've found a body.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.720
Site of the old Seagull nightclub.

17:08.760 --> 17:12.119
And we've ID'd it as Robbie Marshburn.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.000
You remember him, don't you, John?

17:15.440 --> 17:17.839
Must be more than 20
years since he disappeared.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.280
Mm.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.079
I always assumed he'd done a runner.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.920
He was last seen alive at that club.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.720
One of your favourite haunts.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.839
I showed my face there on occasion.

17:27.839 --> 17:31.800
Mm. Did you show your face in
there the night of Sidden's 50th?

17:31.800 --> 17:34.480
I was out with my wife that night.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.320
Police Federation dinner.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.080
All those years ago

17:38.080 --> 17:41.120
and he still remembers
a clash in his diary.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.960
Our department had solved a big case.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.000
My DCI was there to
receive a commendation.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I know they took photographs.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.280
Got 'em pinned up on
your cell wall, have you?

17:52.760 --> 17:54.320
Recognise that fella?

17:54.320 --> 17:57.280
- Aye. What about him? 
- He was murdered last night.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.280
I need to talk to my daughter.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.680
Yeah, well, that can be arranged.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.560
As soon as we've finished talking to you.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.560
Now, this fella was working on the site

18:12.560 --> 18:15.360
where we found this fella's body.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.800
Hm.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.080
What are the chances, eh?

18:20.080 --> 18:23.640
Patty asked us to put a word
in. Said he needed the work.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.000
Ah, called in a favour
with Sidden, did you?

18:26.000 --> 18:29.120
Your old mate. I've
never been there for her.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.680
I was trying to make amends. That's all.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.520
Ah, you've kept her under wraps.

18:34.520 --> 18:38.040
It was never mentioned at your
trial that you had a daughter.

18:39.400 --> 18:43.080
Did you even tell your
missus? Aye, she knew.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.240
The baby was given up for adoption.
So who was the bairn's mam?

18:46.240 --> 18:48.160
That's none of your business.

18:50.840 --> 18:54.120
Well, we think these two
murders are connected.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.280
And now that we've finally
found Robbie Marshburn...

18:59.640 --> 19:02.080
..I'm going to find out
who it was that killed him.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.360
We're done here.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.160
I'm sorry I missed the funeral.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.360
I hear there was quite a turnout.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.280
That funeral that he mentioned.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.120
Who did he mean? Oh...

19:23.120 --> 19:25.280
Oh, that's nothing need concern you.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.200
Are you getting in?

19:48.760 --> 19:51.960
Let's keep this brief, shall we?

19:51.960 --> 19:54.120
My husband gets easily tired.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.800
Scott Keane was found murdered
in his flat in Bebington last night.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.480
A gofer down at the site.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.360
Alec told us this morning. Mm.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.680
And we know it was John Brace
asked you to give Keane that job.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.120
Yeah, he got in touch.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.640
First time in years.

20:11.640 --> 20:15.000
Old boys' network's still
alive and kicking, then.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.160
Hm? Call in a favour, did he?

20:17.160 --> 20:19.640
I don't owe Brace anything. Oh?

20:19.640 --> 20:22.960
Well, in that case, it must be
down to your guilty conscience.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.400
He's banged up for his retirement.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.440
And here's you free as a bird,

20:29.440 --> 20:31.960
sitting enjoying the view.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.920
The body we found on your building site

20:36.920 --> 20:39.280
has been confirmed
as Robbie Marshburn.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.480
Last seen leaving your club
the night of your birthday bash.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.480
He worked at The Seagull
for a couple of years.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.880
Security. No, no, no, no.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.880
No, he was more than that.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.240
We know you two were thick as thieves.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.960
He was your Mr Fix-It
for the Sidden syndicate.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.800
Do you think I'd let
'em renovate that site

20:57.800 --> 20:59.160
if I'd known he was buried there?

21:00.600 --> 21:03.000
Well, the site's been idle for years.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.120
Maybe you thought
it was worth the risk.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.200
You've been listening
to too many rumours.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.440
Now, here's the thing
that's been worrying me.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.800
You're connected to
both of these murders.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.800
Robbie Marshburn might be history,

21:17.800 --> 21:20.440
but the past has a way
of catching up with us.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.800
23 years.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.600
That's a long time to live
with a guilty conscience.

21:26.680 --> 21:27.720
Hm?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.680
It's time for your pills, Len.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.720
We'll see ourselves out.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.680
Still thinks he's untouchable,
after all these years.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.200
What, you think the Siddens
are up to their old tricks?

21:50.200 --> 21:53.240
Using Scott Keane as their
eyes and ears? Well, why not?

21:53.240 --> 21:56.200
Keane was a bit of a loner.
Estranged from his wife and kids.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.800
It was Brace who got him that job.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.240
Mm.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.000
Maybe she knew he was up to no good.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.760
Maybe that's why Patty threw him out.

22:03.760 --> 22:06.160
Well, that would
explain the crust on her.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.280
Pretending to be on top of things.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.680
Er, ma'am...

22:22.680 --> 22:25.040
Scott Keane made two phone
calls on the evening he died.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.480
One was to Patty. The other
was to a pay-as-you-go.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.800
The number's untraceable.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.440
What about that CCTV, anything?

22:31.440 --> 22:33.000
Nothing out of the ordinary.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.480
We've had a crime scene report
from Scott Keane's flat, ma'am.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.280
No prints on the murder weapon. Oh...

22:39.280 --> 22:42.000
Ma'am, I've just pulled out
Scott Keane's bank statements.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.680
And he's used his debit
card in quite a few places.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.600
He certainly got about.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.480
If he's doing jobs for the
site, it might be work-related.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.920
Mm. Let's run a check on his plates.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.800
Build up a timeline,
see where he's been.

22:56.800 --> 23:00.720
And meanwhile, we've paid
a visit to his father-in-law.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.320
Ex-Detective Inspector John Brace,

23:04.320 --> 23:07.840
who was also a regular
down at The Seagull,

23:07.840 --> 23:10.200
and is currently serving
ten years in Cosway

23:10.200 --> 23:12.240
for perverting the course of justice.

23:12.240 --> 23:15.160
Bribery. Misconduct in a public office.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.680
I mean, the list is as long as your arm.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.200
Didn't you help put
him away, ma'am? Aye.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.840
But truth be told, we
should have acted sooner.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.960
I mean, we all heard the rumours.

23:24.960 --> 23:30.200
And Brace was in the frame
for Marshburn's disappearance.

23:30.200 --> 23:34.320
And Scott Keane just happens
to be married to his daughter.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.680
Now, that can't be just a coincidence.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.240
We know that Brace wangled
Keane a job with the Siddens.

23:39.240 --> 23:43.680
Yeah. Now, that makes me
think he's still working for 'em.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.880
Or else he's got something on them.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.440
Er, ma'am, I've been looking into

23:48.440 --> 23:50.560
Sidden Holdings' planning applications.

23:50.560 --> 23:53.520
I spoke to a guy called Ewan Ackley.

23:53.520 --> 23:56.400
He's been quiet vocal in
his objections to the build.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.440
He claims he was
threatened by Alec Sidden.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.120
Well, it seems to be a family trait.

24:03.120 --> 24:06.120
Right, I want that witness
brought in for questioning

24:06.120 --> 24:07.960
first thing tomorrow morning.

24:07.960 --> 24:11.480
I'm telling you, the
Siddens are behind all of this.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.320
We've got nothing to tie
them to Scott Keane's murder.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.160
Well, you'd better knuckle down
and find me something, then!

26:24.520 --> 26:26.080
Boss!

26:27.080 --> 26:29.840
Mind where you put your
feet, the floorboards are rotten.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.480
This building's been condemned.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.880
Well, that's why I'm telling you.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.200
So, what are we doing here anyway?

26:36.200 --> 26:38.840
I'm just getting a feel for the place.

26:40.960 --> 26:44.600
Cos this is where Robbie
was last seen alive.

26:46.840 --> 26:47.920
Hm...

26:50.440 --> 26:53.520
Now, the file says a fella
who was working that night

26:53.520 --> 26:56.000
saw Marshburn leave with a girl.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.120
You've only got his word for that.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.480
Well, what if he's telling the truth?

27:00.480 --> 27:03.120
She could be the lead
we've been searching for.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.280
23 years ago.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.680
Now all we've got to do is find her.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.480
Well, someone else might
have seen them leave.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.360
Maybe even followed them out.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.800
There's a fire escape down here.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.920
A handy exit.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.440
Aye, very handy.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.200
Where are you going?

27:43.880 --> 27:46.720
Maybe they left the
club via that fire escape.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.080
Well, come on!

27:54.160 --> 27:57.640
So, what if someone followed
them out, killed Robbie out here?

27:57.640 --> 27:58.840
Hm?

27:59.880 --> 28:01.040
Now, look...

28:01.040 --> 28:02.960
That must lead to the culvert.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.560
See if you can get that shifted.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.920
Well, not without a
crowbar in my pocket.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.360
Well, not without a
crowbar Well, have a go.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.840
This has got to be how
they dumped the body.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.520
This has got to be how This
has not been opened in years.

28:19.560 --> 28:23.320
Now, what if Scott Keane found
out that Robbie was buried there?

28:23.320 --> 28:26.520
Maybe he overheard
something the Siddens had said.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.320
No-one even knew those tunnels
were there. I knew they were there.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.600
Now, what if he was in on this

28:31.600 --> 28:33.960
and he was supposed to shift that body

28:33.960 --> 28:35.880
and he was supposed to shift
before the contractors moved in?

28:35.880 --> 28:39.200
If there's any evidence in
there, that's a job for Forensics.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.880
Well, get them down here!

28:42.400 --> 28:45.520
Well, come on, then. Are
you going to tell me or what?

28:45.520 --> 28:46.840
What?

28:46.840 --> 28:49.400
Well, something is clearly
niggling you about the case.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.440
Fine.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.480
Keep it to yourself, as usual!

29:09.440 --> 29:12.000
That funeral Brace mentioned.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.760
It was Hector's.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.600
It was me dad's.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.880
They were mates...

29:21.880 --> 29:26.000
..me dad, Brace and Robbie Marshburn.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.200
That's him in the photo.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.240
Taken at The Seagull.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.360
Look at them, as thick as thieves.

30:05.540 --> 30:07.020
Morning, Glen.

30:08.860 --> 30:10.380
It's been a while.

30:11.740 --> 30:14.140
I wondered when you'd show up.

30:14.140 --> 30:17.260
You must have heard we found
a body over at The Seagull.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.020
Aye, word gets round
soon enough on the doors.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.460
Oh, still moonlighting, then?

30:23.460 --> 30:25.100
I get work at the clubs when I can.

30:26.220 --> 30:28.820
I'm too old to be
grafting down here. Mm.

30:28.820 --> 30:32.740
Well, we've ID'd this
body as Robbie Marshburn.

30:32.740 --> 30:34.780
That fella who beat you up.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.980
Couldn't tell you who that was. Hm.

30:36.980 --> 30:39.580
We could've banged him up,
if you'd testified against him.

30:39.580 --> 30:42.540
Sidden, too, for that matter. 
- I shouldn't be talking.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.340
Ah, it's all right, love, just catching up.

30:47.580 --> 30:50.420
I remember where it got me
last time. A stay in hospital.

30:50.420 --> 30:52.700
Marked as a snitch by Robbie.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.180
They still think it was us

30:54.180 --> 30:56.540
that brought John Brace
down all them years later.

30:56.540 --> 30:59.660
Hm. Well, you answer my
questions, I'll get out of your hair.

31:01.020 --> 31:02.700
Now, I need you to think back.

31:04.180 --> 31:06.900
When was the last time
you saw Robbie Marshburn?

31:07.980 --> 31:09.940
It must have been the
night he went missing.

31:09.940 --> 31:11.940
I was working down the club.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.940
You were at The Seagull?

31:13.940 --> 31:16.060
Sidden's birthday party?

31:16.060 --> 31:18.540
Robbie got work on the
door for a few of the dockers.

31:18.540 --> 31:21.020
He'd just had you beaten up.

31:21.020 --> 31:22.980
That was his way of keeping you in line.

31:24.140 --> 31:27.860
Well, then, you must have
seen all the comings and goings.

31:27.860 --> 31:30.900
You must have seen all
the names on his guest list.

31:32.940 --> 31:35.260
Sidden kept them
entertained in a VIP area.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.940
What's this, bigwigs with deep pockets?

31:37.940 --> 31:39.740
Not to mention a few bent coppers.

31:40.980 --> 31:43.500
What, coppers like John Brace? Oh, aye.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.060
He was there.

31:45.060 --> 31:48.460
So, did anything happen
that I should know about?

31:49.980 --> 31:52.580
Right, come on, Glen,
it's here or at the station.

31:54.780 --> 31:58.340
I know that Robbie and Sidden
had words out on the terrace.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.500
Elaine broke it up and
sent 'em back inside.

32:02.700 --> 32:03.780
Did she?

32:03.780 --> 32:05.460
So this kick-off,

32:05.460 --> 32:07.740
is that when Robbie left?

32:09.260 --> 32:11.940
I think he left later with one of his girls.

32:11.940 --> 32:13.300
Now...

32:14.460 --> 32:15.580
Was this the lass?

32:19.180 --> 32:20.940
I couldn't tell you. Well, just look.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.060
No, there were dozens of
'em worked there off and on.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.020
At...

32:27.220 --> 32:30.540
At least he got what
was due to him, eh?

32:47.900 --> 32:51.460
Seagull regulars back in
the day, caught on camera.

32:52.460 --> 32:56.700
We've got Robbie Marshburn,
missing and found dead.

32:56.700 --> 33:00.380
We've got John Brace, now
banged up for corruption.

33:00.380 --> 33:02.700
There's a fella with glasses.

33:02.700 --> 33:04.060
And the other fella...

33:05.340 --> 33:07.060
Well, that's me dad.

33:07.060 --> 33:09.540
Well, what does Hector
have to do with all of this?

33:09.540 --> 33:11.300
Nothing! But he's sat there in the photo,

33:11.300 --> 33:13.140
so I'm putting it out there.

33:13.140 --> 33:15.020
We think that the
woman in the photograph

33:15.020 --> 33:16.860
was one of Robbie Marshburn's girls.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.700
Yeah, we've had a
witness come forward.

33:18.700 --> 33:21.740
Said he saw Marshburn leave
with a woman that night.

33:21.740 --> 33:23.100
Glen Polson.

33:23.100 --> 33:26.340
Who also said he saw Brace
there. So that's his alibi kaput.

33:26.340 --> 33:29.380
Yeah, Polson blew the whistle on
Robbie, and his ties with Sidden.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.500
Yeah, he retracted his statement

33:31.500 --> 33:33.340
as soon as someone put him in hospital.

33:33.340 --> 33:35.540
Now, here's a man
who knows first-hand

33:35.540 --> 33:37.300
what it's like to cross the Siddens.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.460
- Ma'am...
- What?!

33:38.460 --> 33:41.100
I've just taken a
statement from Ewan Ackley.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.260
Who?

33:42.260 --> 33:44.780
That fella that objected to
the seafront development.

33:44.780 --> 33:46.780
He was down at the site protesting

33:46.780 --> 33:48.620
and got into bother with Scott Keane.

33:48.620 --> 33:51.260
Keane must have told Alec
Sidden because, the next minute,

33:51.260 --> 33:53.620
a couple of heavies turned
up at Ackley's doorstep.

33:55.740 --> 33:57.380
Did they indeed?

34:05.540 --> 34:07.180
Well, look who it isn't.

34:09.460 --> 34:12.219
Oh, just passing, are we?

34:12.219 --> 34:14.179
A mother can't visit her own son?

34:14.179 --> 34:16.620
Ah, well, since I've caught you...

34:16.620 --> 34:18.980
..I've got a few more questions for you.

34:18.980 --> 34:20.820
How well did you know
Robbie Marshburn?

34:22.219 --> 34:23.980
He worked at the club, that's all.

34:25.100 --> 34:27.699
Well, we know Robbie
and your husband argued

34:27.699 --> 34:29.980
on the night he disappeared.

34:29.980 --> 34:32.940
If they did, I don't remember. No?

34:32.940 --> 34:34.860
It was you who got between them.

34:34.860 --> 34:36.780
I don't know anything about that.

34:39.340 --> 34:42.260
What exactly was the nature of
Scott Keane's employment at the site?

34:42.260 --> 34:44.540
Errands, mainly.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.580
Pick-ups, deliveries, general supplies.

34:46.580 --> 34:48.940
Didn't rate him, then? He was lazy.

34:50.060 --> 34:52.420
Work-shy. I'd have never taken him on.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.780
Except your dad insisted
that you hired him.

34:56.179 --> 34:59.140
Which makes you wonder who's
really in charge here, doesn't it?

34:59.140 --> 35:01.660
He said he was doing
an old mate a favour.

35:01.660 --> 35:03.580
I didn't see the harm.

35:03.580 --> 35:06.380
Did Scott tell you about his
run-in with Ewan Ackley?

35:06.380 --> 35:08.460
He might have mentioned it, aye.

35:09.460 --> 35:11.420
He said he'd been a
nuisance down at the site.

35:11.420 --> 35:14.140
Well, Ewan claims he was
threatened a couple of days later.

35:14.140 --> 35:16.420
Some thugs turned up at his house.

35:18.340 --> 35:20.500
That was nothing to do with me.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.860
Hm.

35:23.380 --> 35:24.820
I've already told you.

35:26.020 --> 35:27.780
That's not how I do things.

35:27.780 --> 35:29.580
This business is legit.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.700
All right.

35:40.460 --> 35:42.820
The fella with the glasses. Any ideas?

35:42.820 --> 35:44.620
The fella with the glasses. The
one standing next to your dad?

35:47.380 --> 35:49.540
That's Michael Claythorpe.

35:49.540 --> 35:51.620
Did the books part-time at the club.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.220
Is he local?

35:54.220 --> 35:56.940
He used to be. I couldn't
tell you where he is now.

35:56.940 --> 35:58.940
Yeah, we'll check him out
- Michael Claythorpe.

35:58.940 --> 36:00.980
What about the woman?

36:02.100 --> 36:04.620
I think she called herself Mary-Frances.

36:05.660 --> 36:09.060
Junkie. I think she took off
after Robbie disappeared.

36:10.980 --> 36:13.020
Ended up back on the streets, I expect.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.540
Alec Sidden claims he barely knew Scott.

36:37.540 --> 36:39.580
Just did a few odd jobs for him.

36:40.780 --> 36:42.500
Well, he would say that, wouldn't he?

36:42.500 --> 36:45.660
What if his old man's
still running things,

36:45.660 --> 36:48.900
using Alec as a respectable front,
with Elaine acting as go-between?

36:50.260 --> 36:52.940
Like father, like son,
if I know the Siddens.

36:52.940 --> 36:55.540
An apple never falls
too far from the tree.

36:55.540 --> 36:59.780
I'm telling you, if we uncover
what happened to Robbie,

36:59.780 --> 37:02.260
we'll find out who killed Scott.

37:04.300 --> 37:05.980
Oh, ma'am.

37:05.980 --> 37:08.620
I got in touch with a
contact at Companies House.

37:08.620 --> 37:11.300
They tracked down a copy of The
Seagull's old business register.

37:11.300 --> 37:12.780
People with significant control.

37:12.780 --> 37:15.340
Brace's ex-wife owned
a stake in the club.

37:15.340 --> 37:17.340
25%.

37:17.340 --> 37:19.060
Justine Brace...

37:19.060 --> 37:22.260
Now, what would she want
with shares in the club?

37:22.260 --> 37:25.180
She also chairs this private
investment initiative.

37:25.180 --> 37:27.540
They manage the
waterfront redevelopment.

37:27.540 --> 37:29.700
They manage
- Now, what did I tell you?

37:29.700 --> 37:30.820
They manage
- Hm?

37:30.820 --> 37:32.420
Long arms.

37:33.580 --> 37:37.340
John asked me to purchase
the shares in my name.

37:38.460 --> 37:40.100
He said it was a good investment.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.980
Ah, put your wife's name
on the company register.

37:42.980 --> 37:45.140
That's a clever way to hide your assets.

37:45.140 --> 37:47.900
I sold my stake in the
business when I filed for divorce.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.820
It's been years since
we've had any contact.

37:49.820 --> 37:51.820
Ah, but you still have plenty of dealings

37:51.820 --> 37:53.900
with the Siddens, don't you, Justine?

37:55.420 --> 37:56.740
That seafront development.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.740
Sounds like a conflict of interests to me.

37:58.740 --> 38:01.420
Alec Sidden is a
respectable businessman.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.300
He's nothing like his father.
Are you sure about that?

38:05.300 --> 38:08.260
Only, one of his employees
was murdered two days ago.

38:08.260 --> 38:09.860
Scott Keane.

38:09.860 --> 38:11.940
I've never heard of Scott Keane.

38:11.940 --> 38:13.860
As for my dealings with the Siddens...

38:14.900 --> 38:17.540
..it's all perfectly transparent
and on public record.

38:17.540 --> 38:19.540
Ah, well, I'm pleased to hear it.

38:19.540 --> 38:21.900
I mean, it wouldn't look good, would it,

38:21.900 --> 38:23.740
what with you being
a magistrate an' all?

38:23.740 --> 38:27.540
Did you know we found
Robbie Marshburn's body?

38:27.540 --> 38:30.020
His name came up at John's trial.

38:30.020 --> 38:33.020
He'd been missing ten years by then.

38:34.220 --> 38:36.180
If that was all, I've a
bail hearing pending.

38:41.380 --> 38:43.300
Did you know about
your husband's affair?

38:43.300 --> 38:46.020
That fling that landed
him with a daughter.

38:46.020 --> 38:47.900
It wasn't an affair.

38:47.900 --> 38:50.100
She was one of those
sluts from the club.

38:51.260 --> 38:53.980
John tried to persuade
her to get rid of it, but...

38:53.980 --> 38:56.340
..the girl was determined
to have the child.

38:58.100 --> 38:59.780
She was after money, of course.

38:59.780 --> 39:02.300
So, what, he paid her off?

39:02.300 --> 39:04.340
He told me he had dealt with it.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.860
Said she'd left town.

39:19.260 --> 39:21.100
We went to visit your dad.

39:21.100 --> 39:23.060
Aye, he rang us this morning.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.980
He asked us to look out for you.

39:26.620 --> 39:28.460
I told you. I don't need looking after.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.180
It must have been hard
for you on your own.

39:34.340 --> 39:36.060
Your mam and dad not around.

39:36.060 --> 39:40.540
I didn't meet my dad
until I was a teenager.

39:40.540 --> 39:42.820
Just before he went to prison.

39:42.820 --> 39:44.820
So, how did the pair of you link up?

39:44.820 --> 39:46.860
I think he contacted
my adoptive parents.

39:46.860 --> 39:49.700
I only wish they were still around now.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.140
Against the rules, that, isn't it?

39:51.140 --> 39:54.340
He might have pulled a few strings.

39:55.860 --> 39:58.780
So, all these visits
you've made to the prison,

39:58.780 --> 40:01.140
you must have talked about his trial.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.100
The corruption charges.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.420
Aye.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.100
He said he'd been stitched up. Aye.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.860
Of course he did. Look,
I know he's not perfect.

40:11.860 --> 40:15.140
I just wanted someone there, I suppose.

40:15.140 --> 40:17.060
Someone I could call family.

40:18.340 --> 40:20.180
Do you ever talk about your mam?

40:21.340 --> 40:22.700
Your real mam?

40:22.700 --> 40:24.780
No, not really.

40:24.780 --> 40:26.660
But he must have told you her name.

40:26.660 --> 40:29.180
I couldn't bear to know. Why
would I? She didn't want me.

40:29.180 --> 40:31.540
She gave us up for adoption
a few days after I was born.

40:34.860 --> 40:36.420
How did she die?

40:36.420 --> 40:38.340
Cancer.

40:41.140 --> 40:44.140
Mary-Frances Lascola. That's
the name on the birth certificate.

40:44.140 --> 40:45.900
That's the woman in your photograph.

40:45.900 --> 40:48.020
"Father unknown."

40:48.020 --> 40:49.420
There's a court order.

40:49.420 --> 40:51.700
1994.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.900
The child was removed due
to concerns for her welfare.

40:53.900 --> 40:56.580
Well, it say's here her
mam was a heroin addict.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.340
Looks like she was trying
to get her life back on track.

40:59.340 --> 41:00.820
Why do you say that?

41:00.820 --> 41:03.340
A few years before that, she'd
spent some time in a refuge.

41:04.580 --> 41:07.580
Any idea where? I'm
afraid it doesn't say.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.300
There's an address in North
Shields. Curlew Street.

41:11.300 --> 41:14.100
The clinic made a note of it when
they took down her blood type.

41:15.260 --> 41:17.100
Er, any chance I can hang on to this?

41:18.780 --> 41:20.500
I'll need that as well.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.180
Thanks, pet.

41:29.820 --> 41:33.180
I don't think Patty's mam
wanted to give her up.

41:33.180 --> 41:35.260
Well, didn't have a
choice, by the sound of it.

41:36.460 --> 41:39.260
No, it was Brace who
sold his daughter the story

41:39.260 --> 41:41.020
her mam didn't want her.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.740
Playing her for sympathy.

41:42.740 --> 41:45.660
Yeah, but what was he trying to hide?

41:46.660 --> 41:47.700
Hm?

41:47.700 --> 41:49.740
Apart from the obvious.

41:55.940 --> 41:58.300
Mary-Frances Lascola.

41:59.420 --> 42:02.860
Now, this is her in the
photo, standing next to Brace.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.900
And she's the mother of his child.

42:05.980 --> 42:09.060
Now, we think she was a sex
worker to feed a heroin habit.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.900
I ran a search. No record
of any death certificate.

42:11.900 --> 42:13.660
Could be a work name.

42:13.660 --> 42:16.060
No, that's the name on
Patty's adoption papers.

42:16.060 --> 42:17.860
We could talk to Brace again.

42:17.860 --> 42:20.220
He's got to know more
than he's letting on.

42:20.220 --> 42:22.140
He's got to know more No,
not without any hard evidence.

42:22.140 --> 42:23.900
He'll just run rings around us.

42:23.900 --> 42:26.180
Get on to Cosway nick.

42:26.180 --> 42:28.380
Let's find out if Brace has
had any other visitors.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.860
I'll pull out any cases
that might fit this profile.

42:30.860 --> 42:32.500
Mm.

42:32.500 --> 42:37.060
George, we know she was in a
refuge before she got pregnant.

42:37.060 --> 42:39.580
That was what, 1992.

42:39.580 --> 42:43.060
So, we'll check out the refuges
and charities in the area, Jac.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.340
Yep.

42:54.100 --> 42:55.700
Ma'am.

42:55.700 --> 42:59.020
I have some intel on, er, the
mystery man in the photo.

42:59.020 --> 43:01.540
Elaine Sidden was right
- Michael Claythorpe.

43:01.540 --> 43:02.700
Good.

43:02.700 --> 43:05.820
Well, let's go have a talk with him.

43:05.820 --> 43:07.540
See if he can add to any of this.

43:10.180 --> 43:11.980
There's something else, Kenny?

43:11.980 --> 43:13.260
Erm...

43:13.260 --> 43:16.020
Those bank statements of your
dad's you asked me to go through.

43:18.940 --> 43:20.580
I found a standing order...

43:20.580 --> 43:23.940
..for ã1,000 a month
going into his account.

43:33.060 --> 43:36.260
The payments were
made by Leonard Sidden.

43:39.740 --> 43:43.340
Can we just keep this between
ourselves for the minute, Kenny?

43:43.340 --> 43:45.100
Just for the minute.

43:46.260 --> 43:47.980
Mum's the word, ma'am.

44:00.860 --> 44:02.340
All right?

44:02.340 --> 44:03.700
Yeah.

44:16.180 --> 44:18.540
I looked after Sidden's
accounts for several years.

44:20.140 --> 44:22.500
I moved on a few months
before the fire. Mm.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.100
Consorting with gangsters.

44:24.100 --> 44:25.980
You don't look the type, Mr Claythorpe.

44:25.980 --> 44:27.980
Might have been the
reason Sidden hired us.

44:27.980 --> 44:30.500
My clients are mainly
small-time businesses.

44:30.500 --> 44:32.660
Nothing that attracts
too much attention.

44:32.660 --> 44:35.900
But you must have known Sidden
was involved in criminal activity.

44:37.060 --> 44:38.620
I just did the maths.

44:40.100 --> 44:42.500
Now, this is all off the record, love.

44:43.620 --> 44:45.220
I just want to solve these murders.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.500
There were plenty of
people taking bribes.

44:51.060 --> 44:53.620
They were tempted by
the offer of easy cash.

44:53.620 --> 44:56.100
Once they'd bitten, Sidden owned them.

44:56.100 --> 44:58.860
Well, it looks like you've been
bought in this photo, love.

45:03.140 --> 45:04.620
Hm.

45:04.620 --> 45:06.260
He always looked after his friends.

45:06.260 --> 45:08.340
Anything you wanted
was there for the taking.

45:09.940 --> 45:13.100
What about this lass, Mary-Frances?

45:13.100 --> 45:16.020
Worked in the club. I didn't
have much to do with all that.

45:17.260 --> 45:18.820
Off the books, were they?

45:20.780 --> 45:22.780
Put down as expenses.

45:23.980 --> 45:26.420
What about this fella,
ever come across him?

45:26.420 --> 45:28.060
Scott Keane.

45:28.060 --> 45:31.500
Now, he worked for Sidden's son, Alec.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.460
And we think they were
up to their old tricks.

45:33.460 --> 45:36.500
I haven't had anything to
do with the Siddens in years.

45:38.260 --> 45:39.420
Sorry, I can't help.

45:46.900 --> 45:48.460
Look, jump in.

45:50.180 --> 45:53.540
Er, there's another
fella in the photograph.

45:53.540 --> 45:55.220
Here, look.

45:55.220 --> 45:57.060
Hector Stanhope.

45:57.060 --> 45:58.460
What about him?

45:58.460 --> 46:01.580
He was on some sort of retainer.

46:01.580 --> 46:03.860
Regular payments from Sidden.

46:07.620 --> 46:09.460
You're Hector's daughter.

46:10.780 --> 46:12.660
I should have made the connection.

46:12.660 --> 46:15.380
Ah, well, he's been
dead a few years now.

46:18.060 --> 46:21.300
It was your dad's job to keep
the Siddens entertained.

46:21.300 --> 46:22.820
We called him the R & R man.

46:22.820 --> 46:24.620
Rest and recuperation.

46:24.620 --> 46:26.980
I even came up to the
house once with Brace.

46:26.980 --> 46:30.260
Your dad drove us over to
Alnham Manor for a shoot.

46:30.260 --> 46:32.420
He slipped the
gamekeeper a backhander.

46:32.420 --> 46:34.540
Oh, well, that sounds like me dad.

46:36.060 --> 46:37.860
So, erm...

46:37.860 --> 46:39.820
Those payments...

46:41.380 --> 46:43.180
..were nothing to worry about.

46:46.780 --> 46:48.020
Hm.

46:48.020 --> 46:49.380
Right.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.940
What's going on, boss? Nothing.

47:19.500 --> 47:21.700
Another conversation
that I'm not party to.

47:21.700 --> 47:24.060
Look, what is this? Are you
keeping tabs on us, or what?

47:24.060 --> 47:25.340
Well, someone's got to!

47:29.860 --> 47:31.180
Look...

47:31.180 --> 47:33.260
..it looks like I was right to be concerned.

47:33.260 --> 47:37.100
Sidden had been giving me
dad money. Regular payments.

47:38.620 --> 47:40.580
So, if this was a cover-up...

47:41.900 --> 47:44.180
..maybe they were
paying him to keep silent.

47:46.340 --> 47:49.220
Did Hector ever mention Robbie
Marshburn after he disappeared?

47:49.220 --> 47:51.380
Not once. Which tells you
he had something to hide.

47:51.380 --> 47:53.020
Oh, come on, what
have you always told me

47:53.020 --> 47:54.500
about not jumping to conclusions?

47:55.540 --> 47:58.420
Look, when Brace was arrested,
my dad was there in court,

47:58.420 --> 48:00.540
sat in that gallery every day.

48:01.940 --> 48:04.220
He must have known
what Brace had been up to.

48:04.220 --> 48:06.340
Covering for Sidden.

48:07.580 --> 48:10.420
In his last year's, you know, he...

48:10.420 --> 48:11.900
..he couldn't even...

48:15.820 --> 48:18.060
It creeps up on you, something like that.

48:19.540 --> 48:22.460
I'd have been inclined
to forgive him anything.

48:28.460 --> 48:29.780
Jac?

48:29.780 --> 48:31.820
I've had a breakthrough
with a charity, ma'am.

48:31.820 --> 48:33.380
The women's refuge in Whitburn.

48:33.380 --> 48:35.740
One of the counsellors here
remembers Mary-Frances.

48:35.740 --> 48:37.700
Well, text us the address,
we'll meet you there.

48:44.860 --> 48:46.900
You told my officer you remembered her.

48:46.900 --> 48:49.260
We got friendly when
I was staying here.

48:49.260 --> 48:51.940
So you weren't always
a counsellor, then?

48:53.420 --> 48:55.420
I'd been in an abusive relationship.

48:55.420 --> 48:57.140
This place got me back on track.

48:58.420 --> 49:00.700
I decided to train up and
give something back.

49:00.700 --> 49:02.340
I've been a counsellor ten years now.

49:02.340 --> 49:03.780
Hm.

49:03.780 --> 49:06.220
So what do you remember
about Mary-Frances?

49:06.220 --> 49:08.020
She'd had a rough life.

49:09.500 --> 49:11.420
It left her distrustful of people.

49:12.540 --> 49:14.540
Always looked out for
the other girls, though.

49:14.540 --> 49:17.060
Hm. Even let one girl move in with her.

49:18.300 --> 49:20.660
Now, we know she was an addict.

49:21.740 --> 49:24.260
But you need to be clean to
get a bed here, don't you?

49:24.260 --> 49:27.340
She didn't use while she
was staying at the refuge.

49:27.340 --> 49:29.340
I know she stayed off
the drugs for a while.

49:29.340 --> 49:31.220
Got herself a bit of waitressing work.

49:32.860 --> 49:34.740
Then her pimp tracked
her down with a fix.

49:34.740 --> 49:36.740
She ended up back at the club.

49:36.740 --> 49:39.020
This pimp, is that Robbie Marshburn?

49:40.420 --> 49:43.180
He decided who she went with.

49:43.180 --> 49:45.180
Who she mixed with.

49:45.180 --> 49:47.460
Even broke two of her ribs.

49:48.700 --> 49:50.380
Did you know she got pregnant?

49:52.420 --> 49:54.180
The baby was taken into care.

49:55.340 --> 49:58.300
So, did she tell you who
the father of the baby was?

50:00.340 --> 50:03.740
Was it a copper, name of John Brace?

50:05.060 --> 50:06.340
Aye.

50:07.420 --> 50:09.380
All the girls knew Brace.

50:10.740 --> 50:12.740
But Mary-Frances was his favourite.

50:19.980 --> 50:21.300
Keep going.

50:30.660 --> 50:32.900
Keep going.

50:35.620 --> 50:36.940
Keep going.

50:39.460 --> 50:41.380
Stop. Stop it there.

50:44.660 --> 50:46.220
DCI Stanhope!

50:54.660 --> 50:57.740
It looks like that hunch
of yours was right.

50:57.740 --> 51:01.420
There is someone else
buried down there.

51:03.820 --> 51:07.540
Right, well, these are definitely
the bones of a young female.

51:07.540 --> 51:10.140
I'd put her age at late teens.

51:10.140 --> 51:11.540
Early twenties, possibly.

51:11.540 --> 51:15.380
Well, Mary-Frances was no older
than that when she disappeared.

51:15.380 --> 51:17.780
The wisdom teeth are
just beginning to erupt.

51:17.780 --> 51:20.860
You see these sutures here in
the skull, just beginning to fuse.

51:22.140 --> 51:24.500
Any startling insights
as to cause of death?

51:24.500 --> 51:26.380
Strangulation.

51:26.380 --> 51:28.700
Drowning. Positional asphyxia.

51:29.820 --> 51:34.580
I ran a GCSA tissue analysis and
she did test positive for heroin.

51:34.580 --> 51:38.140
Oh, she must have started using
again when she gave up her bairn.

51:38.140 --> 51:40.580
Oh, that's right, she had a daughter.

51:40.580 --> 51:42.500
A daughter, two grandkids.

51:42.500 --> 51:45.460
Oh, well, I can run a DNA test.

51:45.460 --> 51:47.500
We could find out for
certain if they're related.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.300
Every cloud...

51:51.420 --> 51:53.380
Well, I'll go talk to Patty.

51:55.980 --> 51:57.460
Right.

51:57.460 --> 51:59.940
I don't know how to
break this to you, love.

51:59.940 --> 52:02.060
So I'm just going to come out with it.

52:03.540 --> 52:06.380
We've found another body
down at the building site.

52:06.380 --> 52:09.580
Right. So why are you telling me?

52:11.340 --> 52:15.300
Cos there's a chance
it might be your mam.

52:19.540 --> 52:22.340
And I need to do a swab test...

52:23.700 --> 52:27.260
..to get your DNA profile, to
see if there's a familial match.

52:29.540 --> 52:31.980
And what if I didn't want to know?

52:31.980 --> 52:34.700
Well, that is your choice, love, obviously.

52:34.700 --> 52:38.060
But it would help us
to find out who she is.

52:41.460 --> 52:43.860
All right. OK. Right.

52:49.780 --> 52:51.460
That's it.

52:52.500 --> 52:56.460
Now, then, on these times
when you visit your dad...

52:58.100 --> 53:01.300
..does he ever talk about a
fella called Robbie Marshburn?

53:01.300 --> 53:02.780
You're asking me that now?

53:02.780 --> 53:04.780
I know. It is important, love.

53:06.220 --> 53:07.820
Sometimes, aye.

53:09.540 --> 53:12.860
He said it was Robbie's
fault he ended up inside.

53:13.980 --> 53:16.500
Rued the day he ever
got mixed up with him.

53:18.220 --> 53:20.420
And did you share that
with your husband?

53:20.420 --> 53:22.140
I suppose I must have done.

53:22.140 --> 53:24.020
He always wanted to
know how the visits went.

53:26.140 --> 53:27.420
Right. Thanks, love.

53:32.420 --> 53:33.780
He lied to us.

53:35.900 --> 53:37.100
Didn't he, me dad?

53:38.420 --> 53:40.660
She didn't die of cancer.

53:47.100 --> 53:49.260
Her name was Mary-Frances.

53:49.260 --> 53:51.260
Oh, don't.

53:52.980 --> 53:55.660
It must've been very hard
for her to give up her bairn.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.860
Cos I think she wanted to keep you.

54:08.860 --> 54:11.620
She left us a... locket.

54:11.620 --> 54:13.140
Hm?

54:14.700 --> 54:17.980
Like a keepsake, sort
of thing. I'll show you.

54:33.380 --> 54:35.420
I kept it safe under the bed.

54:44.940 --> 54:46.300
It's not here.

54:47.740 --> 54:49.940
Scott was the only other
person that knew it was there.

54:56.620 --> 54:59.020
I want someone back
over at Scott Keane's flat.

54:59.020 --> 55:01.500
He's been digging
around asking questions.

55:01.500 --> 55:03.940
I want to know if he found anything.

55:03.940 --> 55:06.540
Right, and while you're at it, Jac,

55:06.540 --> 55:08.500
see if you can find a locket.

55:08.500 --> 55:10.860
It belonged to Mary-Frances.

55:10.860 --> 55:12.820
Now, I've got a treat for you.

55:12.820 --> 55:16.020
I need you to get over to your
old patch, those clubs in Wallsend.

55:16.020 --> 55:18.380
I mean, Scott Keane
was a regular feature.

55:18.380 --> 55:20.300
Find out who he's been talking to.

55:20.300 --> 55:22.180
I checked in with Cosway nick.

55:22.180 --> 55:25.660
Brace's recent visitors. No
contact with the Siddens.

55:25.660 --> 55:27.460
They wouldn't be that daft, would they?

55:27.460 --> 55:30.020
But his ex-wife, she paid
him a visit two days ago.

55:30.020 --> 55:31.700
Did she?

55:31.700 --> 55:34.060
Didn't she say that she'd
not seen him in years?

55:34.060 --> 55:36.060
Didn't she say Aye, she did.

55:37.180 --> 55:39.460
So, that wouldn't have been a social call.

55:40.500 --> 55:42.180
Get your coat.

55:42.880 --> 55:45.280
So why the sudden
need to pay him a visit?

55:47.480 --> 55:49.680
You came to the office asking questions.

55:50.920 --> 55:53.120
He almost ruined both of us.

55:53.120 --> 55:56.600
Still, you're doing very well for
yourself these days, aren't you?

55:56.600 --> 55:58.280
All this.

55:58.280 --> 55:59.800
Investment initiative.

55:59.800 --> 56:01.880
Aye, you've got a lot to lose,

56:01.880 --> 56:04.240
if this all goes pear-shaped.

56:04.240 --> 56:06.240
We're investigating allegations

56:06.240 --> 56:09.240
of threats and bribes by Sidden Holdings

56:09.240 --> 56:11.600
and any associates that are implicated.

56:11.600 --> 56:13.560
and any associates
That includes you, pet.

56:13.560 --> 56:18.240
Now, you must have known what
your husband was up to all those years.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.960
I knew about...

56:22.040 --> 56:24.360
..the bribes, the backhanders...

56:26.000 --> 56:27.520
..the other women.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.600
But to father a child with
a prostitute was too much.

56:32.920 --> 56:34.520
I couldn't let that get out.

56:38.160 --> 56:39.440
It...

56:42.600 --> 56:44.480
But it was you, wasn't it?

56:46.400 --> 56:48.280
You shopped your husband.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.120
He still has no idea.

56:55.720 --> 56:59.280
We've found a second body
buried with Marshburn.

56:59.280 --> 57:02.440
It's a woman. Matches the
description of Mary-Frances.

57:03.520 --> 57:04.800
It can't be.

57:04.800 --> 57:06.880
What were your movements
on Monday evening?

57:06.880 --> 57:09.320
I was chairing a meeting, the...

57:09.320 --> 57:10.840
..the investment initiative.

57:10.840 --> 57:14.040
Was Alec Sidden with you?
As a matter of fact, he was.

57:14.040 --> 57:16.520
When did this meeting finish?
It must have been around ten.

57:17.520 --> 57:21.200
Why do you ask? Oh, just checking, love.

57:21.200 --> 57:23.560
It happens to be the evening
Scott Keane was murdered.

57:23.560 --> 57:26.000
It happens to be the evening
Do you want my advice, love?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.440
Get yourself a solicitor.

57:35.800 --> 57:37.680
She knows exactly what she's doing.

57:37.680 --> 57:40.400
She hasn't severed ties with Brace at all.

57:41.760 --> 57:44.840
I am going to go and rattle his cage.

58:00.240 --> 58:03.360
We've found another body
buried next to the club

58:03.360 --> 58:06.720
and we've reason to
suspect it's Mary-Frances.

58:09.600 --> 58:13.040
Well, at least have the decency to
acknowledge that you knew her,

58:13.040 --> 58:16.440
seeing as she's the
mother of your daughter.

58:18.120 --> 58:20.840
Well, you arrested her for soliciting

58:20.840 --> 58:22.680
back in 1989.

58:23.840 --> 58:26.360
She was subsequently
released without charge.

58:26.360 --> 58:30.160
So, what, did you come to some
sort of arrangement, did you?

58:30.160 --> 58:34.080
She gets protection in
return for sexual favours.

58:34.080 --> 58:36.520
Robbie allowed that, did he?

58:36.520 --> 58:40.360
Well, the pair of them went
missing round about the same time.

58:40.360 --> 58:44.840
But you told your missus
Mary-Frances had left town.

58:46.880 --> 58:50.920
So, what, did Marshburn
help you to kill her...

58:51.960 --> 58:54.680
..or did he just get in the way?

58:54.680 --> 58:58.040
I never laid a finger on either of 'em.

58:58.040 --> 59:00.720
And then, all these years later,

59:00.720 --> 59:03.480
you set your son-in-law up
with a job with the Siddens.

59:03.480 --> 59:07.120
Got a bit close to them, didn't he, hm?

59:07.120 --> 59:10.160
Maybe he found out what
had happened to Marshburn.

59:10.160 --> 59:12.120
Well, you couldn't
have him walking round

59:12.120 --> 59:13.720
with that knowledge, could you?

59:13.720 --> 59:15.800
Patty might find out what you'd done.

59:15.800 --> 59:18.920
How could I have killed
him, locked up in here?

59:18.920 --> 59:22.560
Well, even if you didn't,
you know who did.

59:27.560 --> 59:30.000
You'd love to solve this
one, wouldn't you, pet?

59:31.960 --> 59:34.280
Prove your dad wrong when
he said he didn't rate you.

59:43.760 --> 59:45.680
You think he didn't
know what was going on?

59:45.680 --> 59:48.520
Hector was up to his neck in it.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.120
Malcolm?

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.240
The second body, we
don't know who it is yet.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.920
But I can tell you that
it's not Mary-Frances.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.880
So we got some DNA out of the marrow
from one of these long bones here.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.240
I ran it against the swab
that we took from Patty

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.480
and the sample was
only a partial profile.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.280
So not enough to be certain.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.400
Oh, enough to rule out a familial match.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.840
On top of that...

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.360
..we got hold of
Mary-Frances' medical records.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:37.040
Now, it appears, back in March '92,
Mary was admitted into hospital

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.200
with fractures to her third
and fourth intercostal ribs.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.480
Oh...

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.440
That does tally with what the
woman at the refuge told us.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.640
Well, I double checked.
I took some X-rays...

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.120
..and these ribs are clean.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.920
So, if it's not Mary-Frances...

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.720
..who the hell is it?

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.000
Oh, come on, George...

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.880
We're looking for a runaway.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.680
How hard can it be?

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.600
I've extended the date and search areas.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.880
These cases are still unresolved.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.840
The woman at the refuge said there
was a lass stayed with Mary-Frances

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.080
in North Shields, from about '95.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.280
But we don't know where she was
from. Could have been from anywhere.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.200
There's, er... a Hexham one.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.200
Have a look at this.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.880
A lass from Hexham.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.920
First reported missing March 1995.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.400
Now, well, that could be her.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.440
Er... Rebecca Murray.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.680
17.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.160
Her dad filed a report at Hexham nick.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.520
Said he'd rowed with his
daughter and she'd walked out.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.360
The parents made several
attempts to get her back.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.400
Eventually, she disappeared.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.160
Last known address...

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.480
..North Shields.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.840
Curlew Street.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.200
George, I could hug you.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.280
Aw, just look at her...

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.640
17.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.120
She's been buried longer than that.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.080
Dental records have now
confirmed the ID of our second body

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.360
as Rebecca Murray, aged 17.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.480
Now, this could mean
Mary-Frances is still alive

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.680
and might even know
what happened to her.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.640
Mark, go through Scott
Keane's phone records again.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.160
Go back a couple of months.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.200
Check his e-mails,
social media, everything.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.920
We checked out his flat.
No sign of any locket.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.640
Nothing's been signed in as evidence.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.240
Yeah, we did get a fresh statement
from one of the neighbours.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.760
She had a run-in with a guy

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.240
when she was trying to
park on Crossfield Street.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.120
Crossfield Street... Well,
that's a main road, isn't it?

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.480
Yeah. So there'll be cameras.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.440
Yeah. Check it out!

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.160
Ma'am, I spoke to the
landlord of the social club.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.440
He knew Scott Keane well enough.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.800
He'd been in the club,
shooting his mouth off

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.640
He'd been in the club, about
his contacts with the Siddens.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.560
One of the doormen had
to have words with him.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.920
Which doorman was this?

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.920
DCI Stanhope has entered the room.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.240
Right. Now, then, Glen.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.560
You've been working the
doors at the social club

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.400
down on the Farrow Road.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.480
Hm?

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.840
Like I told you, I get it where I can.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.520
Yeah, so you must have
crossed paths with this fella.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.280
Scott Keane.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.320
We know he worked for the Siddens.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.400
Got a bit of a mouth
on him, by all accounts.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.320
He started asking
questions about the old days.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.920
When Robbie Marshburn
ran things down at the port.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.000
Ah, so you set him straight, did you?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.040
Talk like that can still
get you into trouble.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.560
Oh, ain't that the truth.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.400
Cos he was murdered a few days later.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.960
Now, this is Rebecca Murray.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.040
A lass who worked at The Seagull.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.560
Now, her body was
found next to Robbie's.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.760
17 years old when she died.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.320
Just about the same
age as your youngest.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.520
Yeah, well, a nice kid.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.200
Was she one of Robbie's girls? No.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.040
She worked shifts as a barmaid.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.760
Kept us topped up with drinks.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.720
Now, was she the lass who left
the club with Robbie that night?

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.040
I don't know that. It was busy.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.880
Now, I'm not sure I buy that, love.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.000
Now, you were
obviously fond of the girl.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.760
Would you let her leave on
the arm of a violent pimp,

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.600
one who'd already beaten you up?

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.920
I would've stopped him. Well,
maybe you went after him.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.280
You seriously think that I killed Robbie!

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.760
Well, did you?

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.200
If you want to point the
finger, talk to Leonard Sidden.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.760
She was serving him drinks that night.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.840
Dolled up to the nines in his private bar.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.160
You're disturbing a family get-together.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.200
Well, we can talk here
or down at the station.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.800
Your choice.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.200
Rebecca Murray.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.720
Never seen her before. No?

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.280
Barmaid. You'd have hired her.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.120
I found out she was under
age. I had to let her go.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.520
You weren't concerned
when she disappeared?

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.520
Barmaids come and go. I got better
things to do than look for runaways.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.600
Well, her body was found yesterday,

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.000
dumped in the same
place as Robbie Marshburn.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.880
And you thought you'd
try and pin this on me?

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.160
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.440
I've got guests.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.600
Aye, you get back to your guests.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.080
Enjoy it, while it lasts.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.760
Why can't you leave things alone,
instead of dragging it all back up?

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.640
Careful, Vera, you might
not like what you find.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.360
That contract audit you asked for,
ma'am, the waterfront redevelopment.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.400
It threw up some interesting reading.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.760
Anything that implicates the Siddens?

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:33.160
Erm, a payment made
to Haletons for ã50,000

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.360
two weeks before they
pulled out of the bidding.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.840
Get Alec Sidden in here for questioning.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.520
He's in this up to his eyeballs!

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.320
Ma'am, I've been going
through Scott's phone logs again.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.280
Er, that pay-as-you-go number he
called the evening he was killed.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.360
Yeah, untraceable, wasn't it?

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.840
Yeah, well, he called the same
number two months beforehand.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.000
The same day he used his debit card.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
It was in a cafe up in Morna.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.480
Morna?

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.680
That's up in the Borders, isn't it?

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.280
A bit out of the way for a delivery.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.400
Has anyone checked this?

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.320
Yeah, well, I just presumed he
was off on one of his errands.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.720
Well, that's the trouble with
presuming, DC Edwards.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.160
Sometimes you miss things.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.440
Aiden, get off home.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.360
We've got an early start.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.880
We're going to Scotland.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.080
Bye.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.360
I'm afraid we've just closed. We
won't be open again until six.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.720
Well, then, we've got time for a chat.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.280
Mary-Frances, isn't it?

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.899
So how did Scott Keane track you down?

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:22.819
I found Patty's profile on Facebook.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.819
Some photos. Her kids.

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:31.300
I just wanted to put myself out there.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.500
What, you sent her a message,
then? I didn't have the guts.

01:08:37.819 --> 01:08:40.859
I saw on her home page
she was married to... Scott.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.500
Seemed easier to message him.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.779
So, when was this?

01:08:45.779 --> 01:08:47.380
Must be over a year ago.

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.859
He messaged us back.

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:51.779
Told us Patty wasn't interested.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.020
I don't think she knew about that, love.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.060
Well, I thought that was that.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.899
I told myself it was all for the best.

01:09:01.899 --> 01:09:03.660
So, what changed?

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:06.500
He called us a few weeks ago,

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.220
asked if we could meet.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.180
And that's when he came up here?

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:11.740
I wasn't even sure if he was genuine.

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:17.100
Did he show you a locket
that you'd given to Patty?

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.660
How did you know?

01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:21.740
Well, we think he took it.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:25.100
He said they'd been
having some problems.

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.420
Wanted to make things up to her.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.859
And he thought, if he could tell
Patty he'd tracked down her mam...

01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:34.220
Yeah, he'd be in with a
chance of patching things up.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:39.620
Now, we think his death is
connected to two other murders...

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.620
..and one of them
being Robbie Marshburn.

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:48.460
We found his body a few days ago.

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.420
Buried a couple of yards
away from The Seagull.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:51.500
I'm sorry.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.779
It's...

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:56.100
..been a while since I heard his name.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.780
Now, that's OK, love.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.180
But we do need to ask
you some questions

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.740
about that night he went missing.

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:08.540
Now, were you at the club that night?

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.700
I only stayed for a couple of hours.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:15.460
I knew Brace was going
to ask us to sit with him.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:19.660
I couldn't bear to even
look at him by then.

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.180
So what about this lass...

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.460
..name of Rebecca Murray?

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.060
We believe she may have
stayed with you for a while.

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.340
Only for a few weeks, that's all.

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.540
She'd just started working at the club.

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.820
She called herself Bex.

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:39.980
Well, we think she was murdered
round about the same time as Robbie.

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.620
Her body was found in
the same place as his.

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:46.180
And we were hoping...

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:49.260
..you might be able to tell us
what had happened to her.

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:51.660
Bex...

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.300
..had seen how much money
the other girls were making.

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.420
She was young.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.100
Just a kid.

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.980
No idea what the job entailed.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:08.060
I warned Robbie to leave her
be. But Sidden had other ideas.

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.180
Maybe if I'd stayed and looked after her,

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.900
instead of leaving her
there on her own...

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.340
Now, don't dwell on ifs and buts,
love. That won't change anything.

01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.620
So, was that when you came up here?

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.940
Well, Robbie had gone missing, so...

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.980
..I thought I'd take my chances.

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.740
A clean break.

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.620
Well, he can't hurt you now, love.

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.140
And neither can Brace.

01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.980
I thought about Patty every day.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.260
Even after everything he'd done to us.

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.260
She was still my little girl.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.660
Good afternoon, Mr Sidden.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.060
You'd better have a good
reason for bringing me in.

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:00.140
Oh, aye.

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:04.060
Your signature on several
incriminating documents.

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:09.060
Transfers of large sums of
money to business associates.

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:12.460
I've already told you,
that's not the way I operate.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:13.980
Well, something stinks.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.780
And I think Scott Keane was on to you.

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.060
Hm?

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.940
He was more than
just a gofer, wasn't he?

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:24.300
Scott Keane was no-one. That's
why you couldn't sack him.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.220
Because he knew too much
about the Sidden operation.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.580
Ended up dead.

01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:34.340
He was asking the wrong people
questions. That's all I know.

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.700
Well, I saw you having words.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.540
Threaten him, did you?

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:42.220
The same as you threatened Ewan
Ackley when he got in your way.

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:44.740
You're not going to pin
this on me. Why not?

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.300
You're a Sidden. You always will be.

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.220
Cut from the same cloth as your dad.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.020
I'm a better man than he will ever be!

01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:59.860
Well, you can just sit
there and take a hit for him.

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.620
Or...

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.300
..you can tell me what you
know about his hand in all of this.

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.580
He must have forged those signatures.

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:22.940
He's done worse.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:25.820
He promised me, when
I took over the business,

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.900
he said he'd let me do things my way.

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:31.940
Ah, now, here's the thing
about Leonard Sidden, love.

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.540
His word never did count for much.

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.580
Look, if you're protecting him,

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.580
that makes you an accessory,

01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.220
and I don't think you'd
want to live with that.

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:47.460
Not if you are a better man than he is.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:54.500
DCI Stanhope has entered the room.

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.540
Now, we have a statement
from your son, Alec Sidden...

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:04.140
..implicating you in the
murder of Rebecca Murray.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.420
Oh, yeah?

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:08.700
A confession you made
to him 23 years ago.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.340
This is all a pack of lies.

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.580
Kids, eh? No respect these days.

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:19.380
If you had any yourself,
you'd understand.

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:20.620
Mm.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:25.100
We also have a statement
from Mary-Frances Lascola.

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.540
A former hostess at your nightclub.

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:30.420
Now, she maintains
that Robbie Marshburn

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:33.820
procured Rebecca
Murray at your request.

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.260
That bent copper's bit on the
side. She's as big a liar as he is.

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.420
Mm.

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.420
But that's not all she told us, love.

01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.180
Oh, it's not looking good for you, pet.

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:53.580
I think Rebecca Murray
was murdered in your club.

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:56.740
I think it was you who killed
her and you covered it up.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:58.900
So what did you do?

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.380
Ply the lass with drink and drugs

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:02.980
and then pass her round your punters?

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:09.700
She was already dead
when we found her.

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.820
She'd taken a hit of something.

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:14.820
Passed out on the bathroom floor.

01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:16.340
Choked on her own vomit.

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.900
We tried to bring her round. I
don't know what happened!

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:20.460
We?

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:23.660
What? You said, "We...

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.380
"..tried to bring her round."

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:28.540
So who was with you?
Robbie Marshburn?

01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:32.060
Did you ask him to deal with
it? That row out on the terrace.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.540
I swear I didn't kill her. I just
needed her out of the club.

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.420
OK, so, he got her out of there.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:38.380
He carried her out that fire exit.

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.940
Got her onto the beach. And then what?

01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:43.740
You killed him too, to keep him quiet.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.100
Dumped the pair of them in that tunnel.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.620
I've no idea what happened to Robbie.

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.500
I thought he was keeping his head
down cos it was him that killed her.

01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:55.260
That talk on the terrace
was the last time I saw him.

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.540
Do you know what, why
would Sidden kill Marshburn?

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:10.380
There's no way he'd
have gone to the police.

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.500
Well, if he suspected
Robbie had killed Rebecca.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.980
Hm.

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:16.380
He remembered
Mary-Frances well enough.

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.820
Aye.

01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:24.140
Her reaction...

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.620
..when we said we'd
found Rebecca's body.

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:28.140
What about it?

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:32.260
She didn't seem very surprised, did she?

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:34.380
Do you think she already knew?

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:40.220
Now, if they really did find Rebecca
dead on the bathroom floor...

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.540
She can't have been the woman
who left the club with Robbie.

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:46.340
Get hold of Mary-Frances in Morna.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.300
I'm telling you, Morna is the key.

01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:51.420
Where are you going?

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.900
Fishing.

01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.140
Come on...

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.900
Aiden...

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.420
..that CCTV coverage came
through from Crossfield Street.

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.860
I think that could be the fella
who argued with Scott Keane.

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.300
Can't see his face. Hm.

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.860
Can you freeze-frame the plate? Yeah.

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.140
I'll pull it up on the PNC.

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.820
Aiden.

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:15.420
I know who killed Scott Keane.

01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:18.020
Michael Claythorpe. We
are on our way to his now.

01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:20.620
You might want to send backup.

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.180
He's there! He's at her house!

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:47.500
Apologies, Vera.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.460
Are you not going to invite me in?

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.140
You've not done the place up, then.

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.220
Oh, it suits me the way it is.

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.740
So...

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.900
..you found Mary-Frances.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:20.980
Oh, aye.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.580
I've got to hand it to you, though.

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.380
You hid her well enough.

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.300
I didn't want Robbie to find her.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.820
But you knew Robbie was already dead.

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:36.180
It was you what dumped
him in that tunnel.

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.620
It was you what dumped
him Left him to rot.

01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:40.220
I'd seen the way he treated her.

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:43.300
She was too good for that place.

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:58.740
Confided in you, did she?

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.380
A lot of people did, Vera.

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:03.020
Not least... your father.

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.780
Ah.

01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.860
That's why you're here, is it?

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:15.940
To enlighten me.

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:18.500
She rang us from a
phone box that night.

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.460
Mary-Frances.

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.020
Hysterical.

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.900
Said she'd found Bex
on the bathroom floor.

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:27.700
Robbie said it was an overdose.

01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.340
I got in my car...

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.660
..drove over there.

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:39.420
I found them on the beach...

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:42.620
..with the body.

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:45.460
She was crying.

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.740
Screaming.

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:53.340
I'd never seen anyone...

01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.100
..in such a state.

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.580
I had to stop him.

01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:12.700
You can see that, can't you?

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.580
Or else he would have killed her, too.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.140
So instead, you caved his head in.

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:24.740
Dumped his body with
Rebecca, in that tunnel.

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:27.260
And then, as cool as you like...

01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:30.540
..you drove Mary-Frances up to Morna.

01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:33.740
I'm right, aren't I?

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:42.620
I set her up somewhere safe,
where no-one could find her.

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.220
Nah.

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:47.580
Or you could have just
called the police, love,

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.260
Or you could have just called
as soon as she rang you.

01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:54.580
The Siddens would
have killed both of us.

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.260
23 years you got away with it.

01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.460
Case closed.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.060
The pair of them forgotten.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.580
And then Scott Keane shows his face.

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.660
Aye, that was unfortunate.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.780
Yeah.

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:15.140
He would probably have
agreed with you, love.

01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:19.420
I only went round there to warn him off.

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:21.060
I don't believe you.

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.700
You went round there
to shut him up for good.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.740
He was after money. Nah.

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:28.900
He'd said he was going to tell Patty
the truth about her mother's past.

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:32.660
Now, you left him for dead while
you went looking for that locket...

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:37.660
..the one thing that linked
Mary-Frances to her past,

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:38.940
to all of this.

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:43.100
Did she tell you he'd been in touch, hm?

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.540
Confide in you?

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:49.020
And you were scared he was on to you.

01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.860
I wanted to protect her.

01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:56.300
I couldn't let him hurt her.

01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.420
Don't you see?

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:01.460
It's you who doesn't see, pet.

01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:05.820
Scott was asking all those
questions about her past...

01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.580
..because he needed to be sure

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.780
that Mary-Frances was
who she claimed to be.

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:13.820
Patty's mam.

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:17.540
He just wanted his life back
with his wife and bairns.

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.420
That was it.

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.980
He didn't need to die.

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:52.900
Did Mary-Frances have any part

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.220
in the death of Robbie Marshburn...

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.180
..or Rebecca Murray?

01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.140
No.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:03.900
She was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.780
Hasn't she suffered enough?

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.980
Aiden, will you give us a minute?

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.060
Come on...

01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.980
Listen, I need you to tell me.

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:44.700
How much did my dad really know?

01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:52.340
He had his suspicions about
Robbie being a wrong 'un.

01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:53.700
And the girl
- Rebecca?

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.860
He'd have never kept quiet about that.

01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:03.740
But Sidden paid him off. Blood money.

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.500
Aye, he took the money.

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:10.100
Your dad knew how
dangerous Sidden was.

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.860
It was his way of protecting you.

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:21.380
Mr Claythorpe, this way...

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:33.180
I thought you were going to be next.

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:35.980
Nah.

01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.940
No, it was more a sort of a confessional.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.460
Brace's trial.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.980
All those hours my dad spent in court.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.340
He wasn't there looking out for a mate.

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.660
He was there to see justice done.

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.700
Huh!

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:56.940
The day that bastard was sent
down, my dad cut him dead.

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:06.140
Where are you going? Cup of tea.

01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.340
Go on, get a wiggle on.
The tide's coming in!

01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.540
Go on.

01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:48.820
Patty...

01:26:49.305 --> 01:26:55.310
