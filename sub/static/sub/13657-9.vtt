[ gun clicks ]

00:37.537 --> 00:40.839
Why is jerry
never here anymore?

00:40.841 --> 00:42.307
Jerry zein retired.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.475
Retired?

00:43.477 --> 00:45.878
But he's been
scoring my targets

00:45.880 --> 00:47.413
Since I became
a lieutenant.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.948
Sounds like he had
a good, long career.

00:51.484 --> 00:55.387
Fine, just --
just tell me how I did.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.022
It's dnq.
Did not qualify?!

00:57.024 --> 01:00.192
No, no, no, no!
Just hold on one second.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.761
I've been shooting here
every week

01:02.763 --> 01:05.230
For almost
the last three months.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.833
If I don't qualify
by next Friday,

01:07.835 --> 01:11.737
I'll be at a desk job
for the rest of my career.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.072
And?

01:14.107 --> 01:16.942
And look at that one there --
right there.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.745
I mean, that bullet hole
is on the line.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.849
[ chuckles ]

01:23.851 --> 01:26.585
It's on the line.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.526
If you end up
in a dangerous situation

01:34.528 --> 01:36.962
Where you're required to be
proficient with your firearm,

01:36.964 --> 01:38.464
Other people could die.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.466
You still have four days
to get this right.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.334
Come back tomorrow.

01:51.611 --> 01:54.146
So, I see you made it in
a little early.

01:54.148 --> 01:57.149
Or way too late, depending on
how you look at it.

01:57.151 --> 02:00.052
I'd say your timing
is perfect.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.386
Who is this, anyway?

02:01.388 --> 02:03.956
Ed dagby, age 36,
possible suicide.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.158
Ooh, worked I.C.E. --

02:06.160 --> 02:08.494
Immigrations
and custom enforcement.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.962
This guy
was an I.C.E. Agent?

02:09.964 --> 02:11.630
Punched the clock
for the federal government.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.132
Looks like the clock
punched back.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.000
Two weeks before he showed up
at the morgue,

02:15.002 --> 02:17.970
Mr. Dagby took a fall down
a flight of concrete stairs,

02:17.972 --> 02:20.105
Broke his nose
and his collarbone,

02:20.107 --> 02:22.641
And suffered a compound fracture
of his left tibia.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.477
But he was recovering
until five days ago,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.012
When someone
from his apartment complex

02:27.014 --> 02:28.947
Called the fire department
saying they smelled gas.

02:28.949 --> 02:32.417
Mr. Dagby was discovered
in his kitchen,

02:32.419 --> 02:34.520
In front of an open oven,
dead.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.488
Okay, so,
the guy gassed himself.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.856
How is that <i>our</i> problem?

02:37.858 --> 02:39.358
Because, lieutenant,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.193
When humans inhale methane
instead of oxygen,

02:41.195 --> 02:42.494
They suffocate,

02:42.496 --> 02:44.329
And the lab
should have found gas

02:44.331 --> 02:45.864
In the victim's
blood and liver,

02:45.866 --> 02:47.866
But when dagby's results
came back yesterday,

02:47.868 --> 02:49.868
The ratio of oxygen to methane

02:49.870 --> 02:52.771
Was muy, muy insufficient
for suicide.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.773
I think we're looking
at anaphylactic shock

02:54.775 --> 02:56.341
Related
to an allergic reaction.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.110
Still not our problem.

02:58.112 --> 03:01.280
First the accident,
then a bee sting, a peanut.

03:01.282 --> 03:04.016
Maybe it was just the guy's
time to go.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.984
Except why open the oven door,
turn up the gas,

03:05.986 --> 03:08.520
And sit in your own kitchen if
you're already choking to death?

03:08.522 --> 03:10.122
Sounds extreme,

03:10.124 --> 03:12.457
But maybe he was under
a lot of pressure at work.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.226
Well,
you're right about that.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.495
I.C.E.'s inspector general's
office was investigating him,

03:16.497 --> 03:17.996
But I don't know what for.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.631
The agent that came to sign off
on my prelim

03:19.633 --> 03:21.300
Wasn't particularly chatty
about it.

03:21.302 --> 03:24.636
And do you know if mr. Dagby
had any serious allergies?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.138
His hospital chart was negative

03:26.140 --> 03:27.706
For pharmacological
sensitivities.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.174
I mean, he had a brownie,

03:29.176 --> 03:32.010
But chocolate-related fatalities
are very rare.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.379
There were no nuts or shellfish
in his chyme,

03:34.381 --> 03:36.648
And I couldn't find
a bee sting anywhere.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.984
What's the point of brownies
without nuts?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.552
You said the investigator

03:40.554 --> 03:42.421
From I.C.E.'s
inspector general's office

03:42.423 --> 03:43.722
Came to visit you.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.857
Oh, yeah.
I saved the card he gave me.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.026

03:48.028 --> 03:49.761
Lieutenant flynn,
would you find mr. Evans?

03:49.763 --> 03:52.331
I want to hear about this
investigation into mr. Dagby.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.667
Lieutenant provenza, would you
and the rest of the division

03:55.669 --> 03:58.837
Please go and check out
mr. Dagby's apartment complex?

03:58.839 --> 04:02.241
Captain [clears throat] I want
to talk to you about something.

04:03.109 --> 04:05.143
Yes, lieutenant?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.751
Uh, it -- it can wait.

04:13.686 --> 04:15.120

we'll need a warrant.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.856
Mike, if we're gonna do
a search, we'll need buzz.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.424
Where are we going, sykes?

04:22.762 --> 04:25.264
Sykes: I can't tell you why,
but a few months ago,

04:25.266 --> 04:27.366
Ed dagby sold his house
in carthay circle

04:27.368 --> 04:30.102
And moved
into this apartment complex.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.770
Welcome to lost horizon,

04:31.772 --> 04:34.606
Also known as
the land that time forgot.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.709
Hope we get in and out
before the place falls down.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.579
If I close my eyes,
I can hear the bulldozers.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.748
Hey,
just because something's old

04:42.750 --> 04:45.617
Doesn't mean it's not
serving a good purpose.

No,
I know they're not.

That they're here
about poor ed.

But ed's dead.

we're aware of that.

You know, there's a trick
to keeping this on.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.974
You know, you're gonna probably
want to talk to howard.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.976
He knows everything
about ed's death.

I know everything about it,

But, uh, I am the one
who called 911

06:24.151 --> 06:27.152
And, uh,
talked to the operator

06:27.154 --> 06:29.087
And let
the fire department in.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.756

to give me a medal, um --

if we can --

Check out
mr. Dagby's apartment.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.508
Why check out a dead guy
when I'm available?

Larry, meet the l.A.P.D.

was murdered.

06:55.349 --> 06:57.015
Ma'am,
we never said that.

A bunch of detectives come
to investigate a suicide?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.220
Oh, no, you can't kid us.

07:02.222 --> 07:06.091
We all worked on the same
crime series in the 1970s.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.026
"prognosis: Homicide."

07:08.028 --> 07:13.031
It ran from '72 to '79.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.200
Oh, I remember that show.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.468
It was about a pathologist

07:16.470 --> 07:18.537
Who was always coming across
murder cases

07:18.539 --> 07:20.138
That the police missed
and --

07:20.140 --> 07:22.040
And helping them
investigate.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.475
Yes.

07:23.477 --> 07:27.946
I was the costume designer
on that series.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.218
And larry was
one of our teamsters,

07:33.220 --> 07:34.886
Vera -- hair.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.155
Pauline -- she was a stand-in
for our lead actress.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.959
Not <i>a</i> stand-in, clayton.
I was <i>the</i> stand-in.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.396
And I was in front of
the camera, too, occasionally,

07:44.398 --> 07:47.332
As up-and-coming female
television reporter

07:47.334 --> 07:48.567
Blanche everest.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.168
It happened
a couple of times.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.770
Five times, vera.
Look it up.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.805
I'm in the business, too.
Just a little.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.774

"the badge of justice."

07:59.079 --> 08:00.445
Larry: Tech advisor?

08:00.447 --> 08:01.913
That's what howard here
used to be for us

08:01.915 --> 08:04.015
On "prognosis: Homicide."

08:04.017 --> 08:05.817
He was our legal guy.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.019
Practiced law
for 30 years.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.521
Knows his stuff.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.256
Well, so long as it has
nothing to do with divorce.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.991

08:12.993 --> 08:15.694
Well, I'm guessing you want
to get into ed's apartment.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.929
Yes. Yes, we do.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.765

of lost horizon around?

08:20.767 --> 08:22.200
We call it shangri-la.

"la shangri-la"

08:27.139 --> 08:29.674
They said they want to speak
to the manager.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.476
Well, that was ed. Yeah.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.512
If you'd like to talk to the
owner, that would be ed, too.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.214
Yeah, he inherited
the shangri-la last year

08:36.216 --> 08:37.782
From his uncle norman.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.117
Our locations manager.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.619
Norm bought this place

08:40.621 --> 08:43.622
So that we could spend
our retirement together.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.223
Poor fellow.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.359
Our best-laid plans,
as the poet says, are often --

08:47.361 --> 08:50.128
And cut.
Thank you, pauline.

department left me ed's keys,

why don't you just follow me?

Um, you know?

09:03.810 --> 09:07.746
I'm not feeling
a lot of grief for ed here.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.248
That, my dear,
is an understatement.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.585
In fact, his funeral made me
want to party...

09:13.587 --> 09:16.454
Like it was 1975.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.732

this place.

from the rear.

To print this place.

killed ed?

to cover our bases, sir.

We would have
these "power failures,"

10:18.719 --> 10:20.318
And they only happened --

10:20.320 --> 10:24.589
Ever only happened during
"dancing with the stars."

10:24.591 --> 10:26.291
The son of a bitch.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.560
But other than
power failures...

10:28.562 --> 10:31.796
Well, there was that strange guy
that hung out with ed.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.733
Oh. The man
with the red mustache.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.167
Scarface.
Yeah.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.136
We called him that
because he had a long scar

10:38.138 --> 10:40.338
From his temple
to his chin.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.407
Bald, about 5'7".

10:42.409 --> 10:44.743
Howard: I guess they were
friends of a sort.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.978
Scarface would come to visit.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.413
But they argued.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.914
Lieutenant.
Don't ask me about what.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.249
[ chuckles ]

10:51.251 --> 10:52.751
You know, at my age,

10:52.753 --> 10:55.754
I get the decibels better
than I do the details.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.123
Hey, if you find the keys
to the storage unit in here,

10:58.125 --> 10:59.758
Uh, could we have them?

10:59.760 --> 11:03.194
Ed locked up
all the good patio furniture.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.831
Sanchez: Lieutenant, there's
probably $80,000 in this bag.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.533
What?
Are you kidding me?

11:08.535 --> 11:10.535
When was the last time
you saw this guy?

11:10.537 --> 11:12.170
Scarface?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.272
Well,
now that you mention it,

11:14.274 --> 11:17.442
Scarface was here the night
that ed killed himself.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.611
But he left
early in the evening.

11:19.613 --> 11:22.313
I saw him smoking one of those
little cigars of his

11:22.315 --> 11:24.049
Out on that balcony.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.117
Pauline: And then,
he came down these stairs

11:26.119 --> 11:27.786
And he went out
through the back,

11:27.788 --> 11:30.388
Even though his car
is parked out front.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.692
Are there any security cameras
back there?

11:35.895 --> 11:37.395
Buzz: Be careful.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.963
It's an antique.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.965
If you look
through this lens,

11:40.967 --> 11:43.234
You can probably see
barnaby jones.

11:48.307 --> 11:51.376
Brake lines on the car
were cut.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.545
If dagby hadn't died
in his apartment,

11:53.547 --> 11:55.580
He would have bought it
on the freeway.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.083
Looks like mr. Dagby
was living right on the edge.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.818
And someone
pushed him off it.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.598
[ elevator bell dings ]

12:18.237 --> 12:19.504
Uh, go ahead, kris.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.005
I'll meet you
in the break room.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.107
Okay.
Hi, sharon.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.743
Hi, kris.
Nice to see you.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.114
So, um,
I was going to tell her

12:29.116 --> 12:30.749
That I needed
a little space,

12:30.751 --> 12:32.183
But then she asked if we could
study again together

12:32.185 --> 12:36.454
For our finals,
so I said yes because...

12:36.456 --> 12:39.524
Look, sharon, I need to find
a way to wind this down

12:39.526 --> 12:42.861
So I don't end up
hurting her feelings.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.596
That may not be an option.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.664
But it has to be,
though.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.634
Hey, you said,
"no pressure."

12:49.636 --> 12:51.369
I also said, "be kind."

12:51.371 --> 12:52.370
Are you?

12:52.372 --> 12:53.905
[ elevator bell dings ]

12:53.907 --> 12:56.174
I'll tell her today,
just in my own way.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.814
So, did you find any
questionable circumstances

13:02.816 --> 13:04.549
Around mr. Dagby's death?

13:04.551 --> 13:05.984
A few.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.619
Tao: Someone recently cleaned up
a lot of motor oil

13:07.621 --> 13:09.487
On the top step
leading to ed's apartment.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.955
Which explains his fall.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.658
Brake lines to his car
had been cut, ma'am.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.327
We view that
as the failsafe.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.563
Then add the gas turned on
at full blast in his apartment

13:18.565 --> 13:20.498
And an allergic reaction
to we-know-not-what,

13:20.500 --> 13:22.634
And the big question isn't
"was dagby murdered?" but --

13:22.636 --> 13:24.803
Tao: Which one of the residents
at the apartment complex

13:24.805 --> 13:26.070
Did him in?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.472
Maybe two of them
together?

13:27.474 --> 13:29.974
I have a theory
regarding this murder.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.409
Hear me out.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.245
It's a bit fanciful,
so just listen.

13:34.247 --> 13:38.683
Our gang of retirees transformed
the lost horizon apartments,

13:38.685 --> 13:42.754
A.K.A. Shangri-la, into their
very own retirement home.

13:42.756 --> 13:45.423
But when the owner, their friend
and fellow crew mate,

13:45.425 --> 13:47.091
Norman dagby, died

13:47.093 --> 13:50.695
And the complex was inherited
by his evil nephew ed,

13:50.697 --> 13:54.265
Our tenants acted in concert
to get rid of him.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.201
So arrest them all.

13:56.203 --> 13:59.037
In the off chance that I'm wrong
and only one of them did it,

13:59.039 --> 14:01.506
That one will eventually confess
to save the others,

14:01.508 --> 14:03.041
And you're welcome.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.776
Supporting
the lieutenant's theory,

14:04.778 --> 14:06.711
It doesn't look like anything
was stolen from mr. Dagby

14:06.713 --> 14:07.946
After the murder.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.881
In fact,
the killer or killers

14:09.883 --> 14:12.884
Left behind $80,000 in cash
hidden in ed's closet.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.119
Customs agents
make $50,000 a year.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.788
Where did ed get the money?

14:16.790 --> 14:18.623
Can't say, but he was planning
on getting a lot more.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.792
Mr. Dagby's
e-mail account.

14:20.794 --> 14:22.861
He'd been corresponding
with a land developer.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.362
"shangri-la is a tear-down,

14:24.364 --> 14:25.797
But the neighborhood
is up and coming."

14:25.799 --> 14:28.633
Last offer for the property
is $3 million.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.301
So why wasn't ed selling?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.503
Norm gave all the tenants
life leases.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.707
Now, they could give them up,
but they can't be kicked out.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.576
And the offer from the developer
expires in October.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.579
That's why ed made living
in the shangri-la so horrible.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.015
Out of the 12 residents living
there before norm's death,

14:44.017 --> 14:44.849
Only five are left.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.351
But they're close.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.820
So close, in fact, that they
made up this corny story

14:48.822 --> 14:52.724
About a mysterious bald man
with a red mustache.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.493
They even called him
scarface.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.662
Now, framing
a nonexistent suspect

14:57.664 --> 15:00.665
May have been believable
on that bullshit crime show

15:00.667 --> 15:03.334
That they all worked on
back in the '70s,

15:03.336 --> 15:04.569
But in reality, it is...

15:09.775 --> 15:12.877
Captain raydor,
this is agent mark evans

15:12.879 --> 15:15.146
From I.C.E.'s
inspector general's office.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.583
Captain.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.118
Uh, agent evans.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.289
Evans was investigating ed dagby
when he passed away.

15:24.291 --> 15:29.360
And, um...What was
this investigation about?

15:29.362 --> 15:32.864
Well, before I answer that,
I have a question for you.

15:32.866 --> 15:36.067
Why is the l.A.P.D.
So interested in a suicide?

15:36.069 --> 15:38.536
Just trying to fill in
a few blanks.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.705
So, what did ed do wrong
at work?

15:40.707 --> 15:42.941
Well, hey, guys,
it's an open file.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.542
I can't
get into specifics.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.144
He was a federal employee.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.212
Should I get
the fbi involved?

15:48.214 --> 15:49.347
Because I will.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.784
[ laughs ]

15:52.786 --> 15:54.118
Okay.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.753
Okay. [ laughs ]

15:55.755 --> 15:58.723
All right,
just the headlines.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.724
[ clears throat ]

15:59.726 --> 16:01.059
Until about a month ago,

16:01.061 --> 16:03.127
Dagby worked
the customs line

16:03.129 --> 16:05.964
For incoming international
flights at lax.

<i>Now, I.C.E.'s</i>
<i>inspector general's office,</i>

16:07.801 --> 16:09.467
<i>Which is like</i>
<i>your internal affairs,</i>

16:09.469 --> 16:12.103
<i>Received</i>
<i>an anonymous tip</i>

16:12.105 --> 16:13.972
That ed was being bribed

16:13.974 --> 16:17.942
To allow some contraband items
to come into the u.S.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.745
He was suspended with pay,
pending an investigation.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.513
Conducted by you.

16:22.515 --> 16:26.985
<i>And how is that investigation</i>
<i>going for mr. Dagby?</i>

16:26.987 --> 16:28.519
<i>Not well.</i>

16:28.521 --> 16:29.921
And not a lot of people
<i>are coming forward</i>

16:29.923 --> 16:31.289
To vouch for his character,
either.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.858
Ed was a miserable,

16:33.860 --> 16:36.928
Mean-spirited, cheap,
two-faced jerk.

16:36.930 --> 16:38.529
I mean, for example,

16:38.531 --> 16:41.332
He screwed a family member
out of inheriting

16:41.334 --> 16:43.501
That, uh,
lost horizons place --

16:43.503 --> 16:44.802
The shangri-la,
whatever it is.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.471
He contested
his uncle's will.

16:46.473 --> 16:49.874
And he swore that someone
had greased the top step

16:49.876 --> 16:53.111
To the stairs of his apartment
to make sure that he fell.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.545
I mean,
can you believe this guy?

16:54.547 --> 16:55.847
[ laughs ]

16:55.849 --> 16:58.016
Did he show you the step
he slipped on?

<i>Did that jerk, ed,</i>

<i>Well, um,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

So you were there.

17:09.963 --> 17:11.629
[ chuckles ] no.

17:11.631 --> 17:15.133
Oh, yeah, of course,
I guess I was there. Yes.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.701
In the course
of my duties,

17:16.703 --> 17:19.470
Yes, I stopped by his place
once or twice,

Maybe three times,
possibly six.

Can't really be precise.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.409
Obviously.

wanted him off this planet.

during my investigation,

17:34.020 --> 17:35.486

17:39.692 --> 17:43.327

Where were you

Wait -- wait a minute.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.218

I had something to do --

committed suicide --

18:08.688 --> 18:10.421
What does that --
what's that mean?

18:10.423 --> 18:13.257
We're thinking that dagby's
death was more of a murder.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.429
Ohh.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.099
All right, okay, look.
Look.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.268
<i>Ed needs to have</i>
<i>committed suicide.</i>

18:24.270 --> 18:26.104
Oh, boy.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.305
He was found in his apartment
with the gas turned on, right?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.107
I mean,
how is that not a suicide?

18:29.109 --> 18:31.476
Ed was dead
before the oven was turned on.

18:32.744 --> 18:34.579
Oh, no, no.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.080
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.415
You see, uh...

18:37.417 --> 18:40.485
I'm gonna be
totally honest here.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.554
If you'd known ed dagby,

18:43.556 --> 18:46.290
You would realize
that killing himself

18:46.292 --> 18:49.827
Was the only decent thing
he had done his whole life.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.463
I mean, the coroner said
he thought it was a suicide.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.599
Can't we just
stick with that?

18:54.601 --> 18:56.934
Is he kidding?
No, he's hiding something.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.937
And we probably need to find out
what it is.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.606
I think I know.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.675
The money we found
in ed's apartment was real,

19:04.677 --> 19:07.578
But the bag we found it in
is counterfeit.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.514
On authentic bags,

19:09.516 --> 19:14.452
They never split the brand logo
over the seam, like here.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.120
This bag is fake.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.688
Come on!
<i>No.</i>

19:17.690 --> 19:19.257
<i>Come on!</i>

19:19.259 --> 19:22.860
<i>What can I do to make this</i>
<i>stay a suicide? Huh?</i>

19:29.768 --> 19:31.002
Sharon: So,
how'd it go with kris?

19:31.004 --> 19:33.504
I had a good plan, sharon.
I did.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.606
I just --
I needed the conversation

19:35.608 --> 19:41.045
To go in a specific direction,
and it never got there.

Okay.

with everyone in my class,

20:08.241 --> 20:10.508
But they are never going to
catch up with me,

a kid anymore

20:12.178 --> 20:14.245

20:55.755 --> 20:57.421

I am a realist,

Flynn: I've heard of carrying
extra baggage around,

21:24.384 --> 21:25.816
But scarface
takes the cake.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.551
Tao: After mr. Evans left
last night,

21:27.553 --> 21:29.220
We secured a warrant
for his fiances,

21:29.222 --> 21:31.055
And we noticed
a recurring monthly charge

21:31.057 --> 21:33.491
For a self-storage facility
close to the airport.

21:33.493 --> 21:37.428
So we searched scarface's,
a.K.A. Agent evans', unit

21:37.430 --> 21:40.064
After he went to work today,
and look what we found.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.565
And this isn't even
everything.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.734
There are two more piles
just like it downstairs.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.336
You're right, lieutenant.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.638
Evans did have something
to hide, including a new car.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.242
We're checking to see what he
paid for his lexus lx 570.

21:51.244 --> 21:52.943
Sharon:
Evans only had his salary

21:52.945 --> 21:55.446
And about $15,000
in debt.

21:55.448 --> 21:58.616
So, where did he come up
with the over $70,000 in cash

21:58.618 --> 22:00.418
Kelley blue book says
it would take

22:00.420 --> 22:01.786

counterfeit luggage.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.523
And considering ed had
a bag like this

22:05.525 --> 22:07.091
Full of cash
in his apartment,

22:07.093 --> 22:09.360
I think it's safe to say
that our victim and evans

22:09.362 --> 22:10.828
Were in business together.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.297
Oh, my god.
Are you having a sale?

22:13.299 --> 22:14.832
I would kill
for a bag like this.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.634
Someone may have
beaten you to it.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.269
Why do you have
so many of these?

22:18.271 --> 22:19.770
Some of them
are worth $4,000.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.172
And they only cost
about $10 a unit

22:21.174 --> 22:22.973
To produce illegally
overseas,

22:22.975 --> 22:25.443
Which makes smuggling them
into the country

22:25.445 --> 22:26.844
More lucrative than drugs.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.779
And I have no doubt
that agent scarface

to tell you what to do,

22:44.130 --> 22:46.063
Because I'm not,

22:46.065 --> 22:48.199
But if the fbi finds out
you have this stuff...

22:48.201 --> 22:51.869
They'll say that our bags
are evidence in a federal crime.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.838
Illegal importation
and poof.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.539
All the bags
will disappear.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.975

the night of the murder?

22:57.977 --> 23:01.345
Let me see what I can do about
breaking his alibi.

23:01.347 --> 23:03.147
We do have
some other evidence.

23:03.149 --> 23:06.250
Five witnesses who can place
evans at dagby's apartment

23:06.252 --> 23:07.385
The night he died.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.553
And what do they
have to say?

23:10.822 --> 23:13.057
Pauline:
It was 8:00 in the evening.

23:13.059 --> 23:16.160
I'd forgotten my knitting
at clayton's.

Clayton:
Every now and then, I sit on
a pair of pauline's needles.

23:18.364 --> 23:20.197
She leaves them at my place
all the time.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.533

of the murder.

So, anyway, pauline and I were
standing at the door, talking.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.628
Not about knitting.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.797
About crocheting.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.699
Howard and I were down by that
half-empty hole in the ground

23:55.701 --> 23:57.468
That used to be
our swimming pool.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.103
We were playing dominoes.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.371
Dominoes.

24:00.373 --> 24:02.573
I guess it always comes down
to dominoes.

24:02.575 --> 24:05.443
I could teach you
how to play dominoes,

24:05.445 --> 24:06.877
But, uh, not now,

24:06.879 --> 24:10.915
'cause I-I didn't bring
my dominoes with me.

24:10.917 --> 24:14.552

how to play dominoes.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.831

to ask larry

24:28.801 --> 24:30.401
If he could go to the store,

24:30.403 --> 24:34.338
And then I saw scarface
out on the balcony smoking away.

24:34.340 --> 24:38.108
Then he went inside, and that's
when the ruckus began.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.577

24:39.579 --> 24:41.312

the argument about?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.753
Of course, I really couldn't
hear the details.

24:49.755 --> 24:52.423
I assumed
that they were dating,

24:52.425 --> 24:54.625
And that scarface
was from out of town.

for the airlines.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.717
We told you what happened.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.353
Ah, but this time
it's for camera.

29:16.355 --> 29:20.124
Julio, places.

29:20.126 --> 29:23.093
Following you up the stairs,
scarface.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.466
Oh, oh.
Just one more thing.

29:29.468 --> 29:32.236
Vera, uh, do you mind taking
your glasses off?

29:32.238 --> 29:33.704
Excuse me?

29:33.706 --> 29:35.639
Well,
when we were here yesterday,

29:35.641 --> 29:38.275
You had just received
these new glasses

29:38.277 --> 29:41.044
Because larry had sat
on your old glasses.

29:41.046 --> 29:44.548
So the night ed died,
you didn't have glasses.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.983
I'll hold them for you.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.051
[ sighs ]

29:48.053 --> 29:50.154
Okay, on "action,"

29:50.156 --> 29:52.723
Scarface will come out
onto the balcony.

29:52.725 --> 29:55.292
Ready...

29:55.294 --> 29:58.395
Set...And action!

30:02.634 --> 30:04.401
Well, vera.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.570
Who do you see?

30:11.009 --> 30:12.242
Oh.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.845
It's that little
mexican fella.

30:14.847 --> 30:15.813
Oh!

30:19.617 --> 30:21.985
Vera,
you said the wrong thing.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.854
Oh.
Yes, you did, vera.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.622
It's not "mexican."

30:25.624 --> 30:27.124
It's "latino."

30:27.126 --> 30:28.525
Latino.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.261
My god, these glasses.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.597
Cut! Check the gate!

30:33.599 --> 30:35.032
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:35.034 --> 30:38.168
You are all under arrest
for murder one.

30:53.451 --> 30:55.185
[ camera shutter clicking ]

31:01.726 --> 31:05.462
"having reached the age
where it is no longer possible

31:05.464 --> 31:08.665
"to put off considering
the end of all things,

31:08.667 --> 31:11.301
"I, norman william dagby,

31:11.303 --> 31:15.839
"declare to this to be
my last will and testament.

31:15.841 --> 31:20.210
"in the event of my death,
I give and bequeath,

31:20.212 --> 31:22.546
After payment
of all my just debts --"

31:22.548 --> 31:24.081
God, tao.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.983
Just get to the part
of norm dagby's will

31:25.985 --> 31:28.485
Where we find out who gets
the apartment complex.

31:28.487 --> 31:29.887
Ah. Here it is.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.889
"to my family, hereunto,

31:31.891 --> 31:34.424
Known as the tenants of
the lost horizon apartments..."

31:34.426 --> 31:36.059
The tenants
of the shangri-la?

31:36.061 --> 31:39.029
"...I give wholly and completely
the property and domicile

31:39.031 --> 31:41.765
Of 1066 north hastings
boulevard."

31:41.767 --> 31:43.867
He left the shangri-la
to our suspects.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.502
But he called them
his family.

31:45.504 --> 31:48.038
Provenza: And that's how
ed dagby got the property.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.573
That's right, lieutenant.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.275
No matter what norman dagby
said in his will,

31:51.277 --> 31:52.776
The suspects
were not relatives.

31:52.778 --> 31:54.745
Ed contested the word
"family."

31:54.747 --> 31:56.113
And he got ownership
of the property.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.447
Forget how ed harassed them.

31:57.449 --> 31:58.949
If they stand to inherit,

31:58.951 --> 32:00.684
This will become murder
for financial gain.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.419
If we can prove
it's a homicide.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.888
I can. I can.
[ laughs ]

32:04.890 --> 32:07.791
God, I feel like quincy,
only without the subtitles.

32:08.860 --> 32:10.127
Ah, you wouldn't get
that joke.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.094
You didn't watch the show
in uruguay.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.529
Never mind.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.865
I can reconstruct the recipe
for the brownies

32:14.867 --> 32:16.233
That killed your victim.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.035
The brownies were poisoned?
No.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.569
Remember how I said there were
no nuts in the stomach contents?

32:19.571 --> 32:21.371
I certainly do.

32:21.373 --> 32:24.708
But the brownies were made
with almond milk and peanut oil

32:24.710 --> 32:27.611
And covered in an icing
laced with frangelica.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.746
It's a hazelnut liqueur.

32:29.748 --> 32:32.983
Ed dagby <i>did</i> have
a nut allergy.

32:32.985 --> 32:35.118
You're missing something,
señor quincy.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.722
In order to turn this allergy
into a homicidal pathogen,

32:38.724 --> 32:40.657
You need to prove
that our suspects

32:40.659 --> 32:42.559
Knew what it would do
to our victim.

32:42.561 --> 32:43.927
And I can.

32:43.929 --> 32:46.229
Okay,
when I found these ingredients,

32:46.231 --> 32:47.664
I stopped looking
at hospital records

32:47.666 --> 32:49.399
And started searching
for calls to paramedics.

32:49.401 --> 32:50.400
Guess what I found.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.302
Huh? Guess!

32:52.304 --> 32:53.837
Oh, all right.
I'll tell you.

32:53.839 --> 32:57.007
Three months ago,
someone phoned for an ambulance

32:57.009 --> 32:59.743
From the lost horizon
apartment complex,

32:59.745 --> 33:01.511
And the call went like this.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.413
Woman:
911, what's your emergency?

33:03.415 --> 33:05.582
Howard: <i>It's my neighbor!</i>
<i>Something's wrong!</i>

33:05.584 --> 33:07.351
<i>Can you describe</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

33:07.353 --> 33:09.853
<i>Well, he's sweating</i>
<i>and he has the hives,</i>

33:09.855 --> 33:11.855
<i>And he's having trouble</i>
<i>breathing.</i>

33:11.857 --> 33:14.758
It sounds as if he's suffering
from anaphylactic shock.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.326
An ambulance is on its way.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.828
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>did he eat or drink anything</i>

33:17.830 --> 33:19.629
<i>That may have had</i>
<i>nuts or peanuts in it?</i>

33:19.631 --> 33:22.299
<i>Well,</i>
<i>I'm gonna ask about that.</i>

33:22.301 --> 33:24.868
<i>Hey! Did ed eat</i>
<i>any nuts or peanuts?</i>

33:24.870 --> 33:27.471
Larry: <i>What the hell's</i>
<i>the difference?</i>

33:27.473 --> 33:28.872
Clayton:
Oh, he ate vera's chex mix.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.640
Vera:
<i>And he didn't even ask.</i>

33:30.642 --> 33:34.111
<i>And he stuck his whole hand</i>
<i>in the bowl like a pig.</i>

33:34.113 --> 33:37.381
Pauline:
<i>He's choking!</i>

33:37.383 --> 33:39.483
<i>To death!</i>

33:39.485 --> 33:41.485
<i>[ crying ]</i>

33:41.487 --> 33:43.153
But he didn't
choke to death.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.288
The ambulance came and
shot him up with epinephrine.

33:45.290 --> 33:46.456
Isn't that right?

33:46.458 --> 33:47.991
Sharon:
And as we now know,

33:47.993 --> 33:51.361
You all stood to inherit
the shangri-la if ed died.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.796
You're kidding.
What?

33:52.798 --> 33:54.564
You expect us to believe
that you didn't know

33:54.566 --> 33:56.700
Shangri-la was
supposed to be yours?

33:56.702 --> 33:58.402
We didn't!
Lieutenant,

33:58.404 --> 34:01.705
Do you think we would have put
up with ed destroying our lives

34:01.707 --> 34:05.175
If we knew that we had
a legal option to stop him?

34:05.177 --> 34:07.077
You didn't put up with it.
You killed him.

34:07.079 --> 34:09.813
After hearing
this 911 recording,

34:09.815 --> 34:11.381
We secured a warrant

34:11.383 --> 34:13.850
And we searched
all of your apartments.

34:13.852 --> 34:18.822
And in vera and pauline's
refrigerator, we found this.

34:18.824 --> 34:22.859
I'm guessing that when we get
the test results back,

34:22.861 --> 34:24.828
The ingredients
will match those

34:24.830 --> 34:28.598
Of the brownie found
in mr. Dagby's stomach.

34:30.568 --> 34:33.036
You know I can't throw away
good food.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.739
Those brownies were made
from scratch.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.507
Clayton: So what?

34:37.509 --> 34:40.777
You still can't prove that
anyone here gave ed a brownie.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.046
No. We cannot.

34:43.048 --> 34:46.950
And I'm beginning to think
there's only one way

34:46.952 --> 34:48.885
Through this mess.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.955
Hobbs: Your honor, the people
contend that the five defendants

34:51.957 --> 34:54.357
Were involved in a conspiracy
to commit murder.

34:54.359 --> 34:56.693
Unfortunately,
the prosecution lacks evidence

34:56.695 --> 34:58.061
To prove which defendant

34:58.063 --> 34:59.930
Committed which part
of the conspiracy.

34:59.932 --> 35:03.266
Also, for me to pursue this case
would include a lengthy,

35:03.268 --> 35:05.702
Time-consuming trial
of several months,

35:05.704 --> 35:08.638
Meaning the people
most available in the jury pool

35:08.640 --> 35:10.040
Would be --

35:10.042 --> 35:11.541
Richardson: Elderly and retired.
I get it.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.877
Therefore, provided they
tell the truth today,

35:13.879 --> 35:15.712
And considering
that the defendants

35:15.714 --> 35:18.482
Will also be eyewitnesses
in a federal case

35:18.484 --> 35:20.617
Involving an international
smuggling ring

35:20.619 --> 35:22.385
And counterfeit luggage,

35:22.387 --> 35:25.055
The people recommend
this special plea.

35:25.057 --> 35:29.259
Thank you, d.D.A. Hobbs.

35:29.261 --> 35:30.494
Mr. Gray.

35:30.496 --> 35:33.663
What do you and your clients
have to say?

35:36.634 --> 35:39.302
Oh.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.138
Larry murdoch.
Excuse me, your honor.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.006
I'm a retired teamster,

35:43.008 --> 35:46.743
And I, uh, I cut the brake lines
on the bastard's car.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.446
Just a little backup plan.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.181
No harm done.

35:52.617 --> 35:56.353
I'm pauline allen,
and I would like to confess

35:56.355 --> 36:02.626
That I greased the very top step
on which ed untimely slipped.

36:02.628 --> 36:06.163
And I helped
with the brownies.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.164
Me too.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.798
Clayton carter.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.168
I shopped for the almond milk
and the peanut oil.

36:12.303 --> 36:18.108
And putting the frangelica in
the icing was entirely my idea.

36:18.110 --> 36:20.177
A flourish.

36:20.179 --> 36:21.645
Vera walker.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.813
I made the brownies,

36:23.815 --> 36:28.018
And I put them out by the nachos
for our weekly taco night.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.153
And no one else was hurt by them
at all.

36:30.155 --> 36:33.156
And I have two more batches
in the freezer.

36:33.158 --> 36:36.493
So, if you'd like to try one
yourself --

36:36.495 --> 36:38.895
No? Okay.

36:39.997 --> 36:41.665
[ clears throat ]

36:41.667 --> 36:44.401
Uh, I'm howard gray,
and, uh...

36:44.403 --> 36:45.969
[ clears throat ]

36:45.971 --> 36:49.539
Ed helped himself to our buffet
without asking

36:49.541 --> 36:52.676
And walked off
with two brownies.

36:52.678 --> 36:55.645
We waited while he went
upstairs to eat,

36:55.647 --> 36:59.082
And then after he choked
to death on his own rudeness

36:59.084 --> 37:02.485
And his cries for help
kind of petered out,

37:02.487 --> 37:06.056
I propped him up
in one of those kitchen chairs

37:06.058 --> 37:09.059
And turned on the gas
and called 911.

37:10.528 --> 37:13.063
And we're very sorry,
your honor,

37:13.065 --> 37:19.069
And we promise never to let
someone kill themselves again.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.508
I see.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.344
Well, uh
[clears throat]

37:27.346 --> 37:31.715
Taking into account
the 378 collective years

37:31.717 --> 37:34.451
The five of you have spent
on the planet with no priors

37:34.453 --> 37:36.553
And the fact
that not a single one of you

37:36.555 --> 37:38.955
Can actually be charged
with murder,

37:38.957 --> 37:41.057
I accept the plea
of manslaughter

37:41.059 --> 37:45.061
And agree in principle
to two years of house arrest

37:45.063 --> 37:46.796
For each of the five defendants,

37:46.798 --> 37:48.632
Followed by nine years
of probation.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.533
[ clears throat ]
your honor.

37:50.535 --> 37:53.470
The l.A.P.D. Would like to ask
that house arrest

37:53.472 --> 37:56.139
Extend some special requests.

37:56.141 --> 37:57.774
Such as?

37:57.776 --> 38:00.076
Each of these defendants

38:00.078 --> 38:02.979
Volunteers as a judge
for the emmys,

38:02.981 --> 38:05.448
Television's highest honor.

38:05.450 --> 38:09.419
It's an award show, judge,
that requires their presence

38:09.421 --> 38:12.222
At panels
and special screenings.

38:14.091 --> 38:16.626
Well, I can appreciate
that the defendants

38:16.628 --> 38:18.828
Are passing along
their property in trust

38:18.830 --> 38:20.130
To the children's hospital.

38:20.132 --> 38:21.665
I will take that
into consideration

38:21.667 --> 38:24.768
When we discuss special requests
during sentencing.

38:24.770 --> 38:27.304
If there's nothing further,
we're finished for today.

38:36.013 --> 38:37.914
It looks as if
you're beginning

38:37.916 --> 38:40.450
To like the deal-making process,
lieutenant.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.751
Yeah.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.187
What is it you wanted
to talk to me about?

38:44.189 --> 38:45.755
Uh, one more day.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.824
Captain, if you don't mind.
Just one more day.

38:59.970 --> 39:01.604
Kris: Okay.

39:01.606 --> 39:02.972
So, before we get so caught up
in the panic of 1873

39:02.974 --> 39:06.843
We can't think straight,
I have a surprise.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.511
What's that?

39:11.649 --> 39:14.451
Is this a -- a gift?

39:15.553 --> 39:17.987
Kris,
why did you buy me a gift?

39:17.989 --> 39:19.489
I didn't.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.491
My mother felt bad
about how she judged you,

39:21.493 --> 39:24.127
And she makes jewelry
for a living, so...

39:24.129 --> 39:25.562
Home.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.364
That's all real silver, too,

39:27.366 --> 39:31.201
Because home is
a valuable thing, right?

39:33.003 --> 39:34.971
You know, it's what you're
fighting to keep.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.075
What do you think?

39:39.077 --> 39:41.344
Uh...Wow.

39:41.346 --> 39:43.313
Kris...

39:43.315 --> 39:45.749
Thank you.

39:47.752 --> 39:50.153
Can you just wait here?

39:50.155 --> 39:51.888
Just one second.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.257
Sure.
