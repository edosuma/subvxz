00:05.304 --> 00:07.072
<i>(jill)</i> hi!
Hi there.

00:07.073 --> 00:10.641
Did you get my spaghetti made?
I have to make it to that
potluck...

00:10.642 --> 00:12.643
Oh, my god!
What is that?

00:12.644 --> 00:17.949
That is the binford 6100
commercial vacu-hood.

00:17.950 --> 00:21.820
The residential version only has
a one-horsepower blower motor.

00:21.821 --> 00:24.989
This bad boy has ten horsepower.
What do you think?

00:24.990 --> 00:26.358
Very impressive.
Thank you.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.360
Take it down.
<i>(laughs)</i>

00:28.361 --> 00:30.228
You don't even know
what you have here.

00:30.229 --> 00:33.065
I asked you for
a simple little exhaust fan.

00:33.066 --> 00:35.533
Well, this simple
little exhaust fan

00:35.534 --> 00:40.205
Will suck 20,000 cubic feet of
stinky air a minute.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.841
Take it down.

00:42.842 --> 00:44.676
You want stinky air?

00:44.677 --> 00:47.679
I live with it in the bedroom.
I can live with it in
the kitchen.

00:50.048 --> 00:51.616
<i>(whirring)</i>

01:00.559 --> 01:03.161
What was that?

01:03.162 --> 01:05.196
Uh, just...
Just testing it out.

01:05.197 --> 01:08.700
Where's my spaghetti?
I have to take it to ypsilanti!

01:08.701 --> 01:11.102
It's probably
already there.

01:11.103 --> 01:13.804
Oh, man!

02:05.891 --> 02:07.858
Hey, jason.
What's up?

02:07.859 --> 02:10.127
You know my parents don't
like you coming here when
I'm studying.

02:10.127 --> 02:11.529
Just thought you'd
like to know

02:11.530 --> 02:13.798
Big party at lisa beldon's
on Saturday night.

02:13.799 --> 02:17.769
I can't go. I have to study
for history finals all weekend.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.071
Not necessarily.
You're talking to someone

02:20.072 --> 02:21.773
That can get you
a preview copy of that test.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.642
Really?

02:23.643 --> 02:25.043
It's my final exam
clearance sale.

02:25.044 --> 02:28.880
Everything must go.
The deals are insane.

02:28.881 --> 02:30.182
What if my parents find out?

02:30.183 --> 02:32.183
The parents never find out.

02:32.184 --> 02:34.753
I deliver late at night
and slip it under the door.

02:34.754 --> 02:37.088
Hey, brad.

02:37.089 --> 02:41.860
Some of that spaghetti got
all the way across the street
into doc johnson's buick.

02:41.861 --> 02:44.930
Hi, mr. Taylor.
Hello, jason.

02:44.931 --> 02:47.899
Brad, we talked about jason
coming over while you're
doing your homework.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.835
I didn't come to see brad.
Came to see you!

02:52.572 --> 02:54.506
Is that a fact, jason?
Yeah.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.608
I just wanted to ask
your advice on power tools.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.710
I'm thinking of buying
my first one.

02:58.711 --> 03:00.545
Really? What kind were
you gonna buy, jason?

03:00.546 --> 03:03.148
I was thinking of buying
a seven-and-a-quarter-inch
circular saw.

03:03.149 --> 03:05.317
Really?

03:05.318 --> 03:07.819
Yeah. Something with
a combination blade.

03:07.820 --> 03:10.755
All right! That's good for
crosscutting and rip-cutting.

03:10.756 --> 03:13.792
But you want to get yourself
a fine-tooth finish blade for
precise cuts.

03:13.793 --> 03:17.796
Stainless steel?
I'd go with the carbide tip.

03:17.797 --> 03:21.433
Whew! Thank you.

03:21.434 --> 03:24.603
Well, I gotta get home
and watch today's <i>tool time.</i>

03:24.604 --> 03:27.338
I tape 'em all.

03:27.339 --> 03:31.209
Don't be such a stranger
around here, jason.

03:31.210 --> 03:34.279
Boy, oh, boy.
I love that kid.

03:36.348 --> 03:39.284
Hey, dad, there's a policeman
in wilson's yard.
I see.

03:39.285 --> 03:42.320
I hope everything's all right.
Stay here, please.

03:42.321 --> 03:43.888
<i>(dispatch voice)</i>

03:43.889 --> 03:46.024
Oh!

03:47.126 --> 03:50.461
<i>(whistles)</i>

03:50.462 --> 03:52.463
Wilson, what happened?

03:52.464 --> 03:56.000
Well, tim, I'm afraid
I had a break-in.
Are you all right?

03:56.001 --> 03:58.069
Yeah, I'm a little shook up.
Luckily I wasn't here when it
happened.

03:58.070 --> 04:02.106
Tim, this is officer guidry.
Officer, this is my neighbor,
tim taylor.

04:02.107 --> 04:05.277
How are you doing?
Oh, yeah.
I've seen your show.

04:05.278 --> 04:09.314
It's always nice to
meet a fan.
Who said I was a fan?

04:09.315 --> 04:12.650
Boy! I cannot believe
this happened.

04:12.651 --> 04:14.786
They took some of
my most valued possessions.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.988
What'd they get?
A tv? Stereo?

04:16.988 --> 04:18.890
No, no, no.
Much worse than that.

04:18.891 --> 04:22.060
Number one, they took
my cheek extender from fiji.

04:22.060 --> 04:26.230
Number two, they took
my stuffed cow's hoof.

04:26.231 --> 04:29.200
But the thing that really
makes me feel violated is

04:29.201 --> 04:33.138
They took my african
mucous cup.

04:33.139 --> 04:37.342
They always take
the good stuff.

04:37.343 --> 04:42.113
How am I gonna write this up?
I mean, what's an african
mucous cup worth?

04:42.114 --> 04:46.684
Well, not much here in detroit.
But in africa you can get six
goats and a virgin.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.859
Hey, marty. Hey, harry.
Hey, tim.

04:54.860 --> 04:56.795
Benny.
Hey, tim.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.162
Just how I love my coffee -

04:58.163 --> 05:00.532
Poured by somebody else.
Thank you, ben.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.334
Hi, tim.
Hey, al.

05:02.335 --> 05:06.838
Hey, guys. Hear the news?
Wilson was robbed today.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.340
Really?
Oh, no!

05:08.341 --> 05:10.775
Is he all right?
Well, you know,
physically, yeah.

05:10.776 --> 05:14.679
I hope they didn't get
his mucous cup.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.784
What the hell is
a mucous cup?

05:19.785 --> 05:21.986
It's an earthenware
goblet from africa

05:21.987 --> 05:26.157
That's used as
a spittoon for excess phlegm.

05:26.158 --> 05:29.326
You sure seem to know a lot
about a mucous cup.

05:29.327 --> 05:33.064
Were you on the crime scene
11 or so this morning?

05:33.065 --> 05:35.633
Yeah, al. Everybody knows
you always dreamed of

05:35.634 --> 05:38.870
Owning a complete set of
mucous-ware.

05:41.107 --> 05:44.075
No matter how much I covet
a mucous cup, I would never
steal one.

05:44.076 --> 05:47.345
Hey, tim. Didn't wilson have
a security system or something?

05:47.346 --> 05:48.880
No, I don't think so.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.849
I have the best security system
in the world -

05:50.850 --> 05:53.818
I own nothing of value.

05:53.819 --> 05:57.455
Hey, I got an even better one.
My wife delores.

05:57.456 --> 06:03.194
Burglar takes a look at her
with no makeup, he's scared
straight.

06:03.195 --> 06:06.531
You know, I don't have
a security system.
<i>(marty)</i> huh.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.399
Hey!

06:08.400 --> 06:11.936
Maybe it's time the tool man had
his own security system.

06:11.937 --> 06:14.873
Oh, boy! I've been waiting for
this day a long time.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.941
All right, all right,
all right.

06:16.942 --> 06:19.544
Tim buying an alarm system?
Ka-ching! Ka-ching!

06:19.545 --> 06:21.446
Yeah. This is gonna be good.

06:21.447 --> 06:24.048
The tim taylor
high-security compound.

06:24.049 --> 06:26.484
It's gonna be the only home
with first-strike capability.

06:26.485 --> 06:29.421
Yeah!
What do you got?

06:29.422 --> 06:33.358
A surveillance camera
with ultrasensitive microphones.

06:33.359 --> 06:34.959
Let me have a dozen.
All right.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.395
You need a master pad
to tie that system together.

06:37.396 --> 06:40.197
Get that.
And you ought to get those
infrared motion sensors.

06:40.198 --> 06:43.234
They're over here.
144 of those.
A gross, make it.

06:43.235 --> 06:45.737
Don't forget the siren.
Get me a couple sirens.

06:45.738 --> 06:49.808
Lights. I'll get the big truck
around front. We'll load up.
Where are the keys?

06:49.809 --> 06:52.076
This will be the biggest thing
you've ever done,

06:52.077 --> 06:54.179
Bigger than the hood vent
you put in the kitchen.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.780
Oh, way bigger!
Whoa, whoa.

06:55.781 --> 06:58.049
Why did you bring that up?

06:58.050 --> 07:01.385
Wait a minute. What's wrong?
Jill made me take
that thing out.

07:01.386 --> 07:04.122
And I promised her I wouldn't
go overboard in any other
installations.

07:04.123 --> 07:07.758
What are you saying, tim?

07:09.695 --> 07:13.831
I'm saying it's probably
a better idea to just go
with a basic unit.

07:17.503 --> 07:20.472
Yeah. The chances of
that happening!

07:20.473 --> 07:22.039
Guys, I'm serious.
I'm serious.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.076
I think it's time the tool man
just scaled back a bit.

07:25.077 --> 07:29.046
Yeah, right. That would be
like babe ruth bunting.

07:29.047 --> 07:31.148
Raquel welch
wearing a parka.

07:31.149 --> 07:35.119
Benny picking up
a check.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.021
It would be like my mother
going to a buffet

07:37.022 --> 07:38.956
And only having a salad.

07:42.127 --> 07:44.529
Did I say that?

07:46.665 --> 07:48.032
Hi.
Aah!

07:48.033 --> 07:49.734
Aah!

07:51.070 --> 07:53.104
Why were we yelling?
I'm sorry.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.607
I'm just a little jumpy.
Wilson got robbed.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.443
That's why I bought
an alarm for the house.

07:58.444 --> 08:01.079
You did?
Yes. But you'd be proud of me.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.782
I got a base-down, stripped
unit. Bottom-of-the-line,
very simple.

08:04.783 --> 08:07.385
Bottom-of-the-line?
Bottom-of-the-line.
Almost an empty box.

08:09.688 --> 08:12.290
What are you, crazy?
What?

08:12.291 --> 08:16.094
Do you care nothing
about your family?

08:18.730 --> 08:21.532
What?
Well, the kids are
alone all the time now.

08:21.533 --> 08:25.470
Mark is terrified.
You come home with this toy?

08:27.372 --> 08:29.207
<i>(stammering)</i>

08:33.578 --> 08:36.347
Do you want something bigger?
Yes! Yes!

08:36.347 --> 08:41.619
I want something much,
much bigger!
Well, uh...

08:41.620 --> 08:44.656
Am I in the right house?

08:44.657 --> 08:48.292
Look, if this can happen to
wilson, it can happen to us!

08:48.293 --> 08:50.562
I want floodlights,
surveillance cameras,

08:50.563 --> 08:54.065
Panic buttons,
the works, everything!

08:54.066 --> 08:57.368
You know, I am getting
very excited.

08:57.369 --> 09:00.872
I hope this isn't
just a big tease.

09:04.509 --> 09:07.178
I am not teasing you.

09:07.179 --> 09:09.313
I am turning you loose

09:09.314 --> 09:15.053
To buy the biggest,
most powerful security system
that money can buy.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.554
Ohh...

09:21.226 --> 09:26.898
I will even allow you to do
a <i>tool time</i> remote in the house.

09:30.302 --> 09:35.472
I have never loved you
as much as I do at this moment.

09:37.342 --> 09:39.577
Be back in a while.

09:44.416 --> 09:47.685
If I was to buy
the answers to the test,
how much would it cost me?

09:47.686 --> 09:51.389
For you? 30 bucks.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.925
30 bucks? I'm sorry.
All I have is 20.

09:54.926 --> 09:59.330
Did I say thir...?
I meant 20.

09:59.331 --> 10:01.199
All right.
I guess that's a deal.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.635
Now, remember - under the door
around midnight.

10:04.636 --> 10:07.138
<i>(door opens)</i>
everybody this way.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.806
Why don't you bring it
on down in the family room?
Over there by the fireplace.

10:09.807 --> 10:13.511
Come on in. Let's go.
Keep it moving.
Ok.

10:13.512 --> 10:15.579
That's good.

10:17.649 --> 10:21.486
All right. Hey, jase.
How's that new saw?

10:21.487 --> 10:24.355
Saw? Oh, just fine.
Very...

10:24.356 --> 10:26.758
Sharp.

10:26.759 --> 10:30.028
You guys have to
get out of the room.
We're doing a <i>tool time</i> here.

10:30.029 --> 10:34.265
Wow. You're doing an actual
<i>tool time</i> right here in
the house?

10:34.266 --> 10:38.635
I bet you'd like to watch.
I wish I could.
But finals are starting Monday.

10:38.636 --> 10:41.505
And that's always
a very hectic time for me.

10:44.476 --> 10:46.911
Keep your nose to
the grindstone.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.679
I will. And if I ever
buy a grindstone,

10:48.680 --> 10:52.683
I assure you it'll be
a binford.

10:58.122 --> 11:00.858
Does everybody know
what time it is?

11:00.859 --> 11:03.060
<i>Tool time!</i>

11:05.164 --> 11:07.665
That's right. Welcome to a very
special <i>tool time</i> -

11:07.666 --> 11:11.569
Live from the home of our star,
tim "the tool man" taylor!

11:11.570 --> 11:13.938
Whoo-hoo!
<i>(♪ "tool time" theme)</i>

11:13.939 --> 11:15.840
Thank you, heidi.
Thank you, everybody.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.509
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>
I am tim "the tool man" taylor.

11:18.510 --> 11:20.712
And you all know my assistant,
al borland.

11:20.713 --> 11:24.448
We're gonna show you how to
install a high-tech,

11:24.449 --> 11:26.550
Super-charged security system.

11:26.551 --> 11:29.020
That's right.
The first thing is to determine

11:29.021 --> 11:32.590
What areas of your home are
most vulnerable to a break-in.

11:32.591 --> 11:37.762
But since the only thing al
can break into is a sweat...

11:37.763 --> 11:40.497
We've invited a reformed burglar
to help us out.

11:40.498 --> 11:45.469
I'd like to welcome on the show,
sammy "the snake" nash.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.972
Welcome, sammy.
Thanks, tim.

11:47.973 --> 11:50.208
It's a pleasure to be
in your home.
Uh-huh.

11:50.209 --> 11:54.378
You have some
beautiful things in here.

11:54.379 --> 11:56.446
And I'd like to
keep them in here.

11:56.447 --> 11:58.716
I'm not into that anymore.

11:58.717 --> 12:02.853
Good. Because I understand
your parole officer watches
the show every night.

12:02.854 --> 12:06.356
All right. Well, sammy,
where would you like to begin?

12:06.357 --> 12:09.026
With the obvious, al.
The front door.

12:09.027 --> 12:11.028
I'll step outside.
You lock it up.

12:11.029 --> 12:12.730
And we'll see just
how secure it is.

12:12.731 --> 12:17.168
Ok. Great. Good.
Great. Fine.

12:17.169 --> 12:19.904
I think the old samster's in
for a little surprise.

12:19.905 --> 12:24.474
That's a solid oak door.
I installed a rim-proof,
jimmy-proof lock myself,

12:24.475 --> 12:26.543
Which I call pretty much
impenetrable.

12:26.544 --> 12:29.246
<i>(lock jiggles)</i>

12:29.247 --> 12:32.683
Pretty much. Unless you're
foolish enough not to use
the deadbolt.

12:32.684 --> 12:35.219
Then someone could open it
with a credit card.

12:35.220 --> 12:38.055
Well, good way to wreck
your credit card.

12:38.056 --> 12:41.525
Actually,
I wrecked yours.

12:41.526 --> 12:43.928
All right. Hmm...

12:43.929 --> 12:47.698
Let's step out into the backyard
and see if there are any
vulnerable places out there.

13:28.206 --> 13:30.541
<i>(alarm sounds)</i>

13:34.112 --> 13:38.081
You've watched us install one
of the most advanced security
systems available.

13:38.082 --> 13:41.685
Next, pick a secret password
and provide that to your
security company.

13:41.686 --> 13:44.321
You wanna pick a word
that's easy to remember,

13:44.322 --> 13:47.758
Perhaps has a special meaning
for you, like the name of a pet
or a loved one.

13:47.759 --> 13:50.827
For instance,
I picked "saber saw."

13:54.098 --> 13:58.335
Perhaps now you'd like to choose
a word that our viewing audience
hasn't heard.

14:03.508 --> 14:05.842
Perhaps.

14:05.843 --> 14:10.748
And for all you criminals out
there, it might not be another
tool. It might be a car.

14:13.752 --> 14:16.087
See you next time
on <i>tool time.</i>
Bye now.

14:16.088 --> 14:19.055
<i>(♪ "tool time" theme)</i>

14:19.056 --> 14:22.493
Ok, let's move it out.
Take that belt.
You guys move it.

14:22.494 --> 14:25.262
Get it back to the studio
so we can get it wrapped up.

14:25.263 --> 14:27.398
See you in the morning.
All right, buddy.
Thanks a lot.

14:27.399 --> 14:30.701
Honey, we're all set.
Great. Show me how it works.

14:30.702 --> 14:32.603
Easy as pie. Now, this is
the downstairs panel.

14:32.604 --> 14:36.273
You can operate the entire
system from this panel alone
on simple 21 buttons.

14:36.274 --> 14:39.911
21 buttons.
That's right. 21 buttons,
18 zones.

14:39.912 --> 14:43.047
21 buttons, 18 zones.
That's right.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.482
It's very simple.
If you want to leave the house

14:45.483 --> 14:50.554
And set the system in gear,
you press "arm-command"

14:50.555 --> 14:54.558
"36824-star-7."

14:54.559 --> 14:56.160
Ok?

14:56.161 --> 14:59.096
All right now, if you're in
the house during the day

14:59.097 --> 15:02.266
And you do not want the motion
sensors on, which is a great
idea

15:02.267 --> 15:10.174
"arm-command-a3423423."

15:10.175 --> 15:13.978
Simple, yeah?
"star-bypass-pound-6."

15:13.979 --> 15:17.949
<i>(beeps)</i>
are you with me so far?

15:17.950 --> 15:24.388
I lost you after you said,
"this is the downstairs panel."

15:24.389 --> 15:27.424
Once you use it, you'll find
this very easy to use.

15:27.425 --> 15:30.594
Ok. What if
the motion sensors are on,

15:30.595 --> 15:33.631
But I want to go downstairs
to get something to eat?

15:33.632 --> 15:37.435
Um...
Well, you can't.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.271
I can't?
What am I supposed to do?

15:40.272 --> 15:41.338
What are you
supposed to do? Oh.

15:41.339 --> 15:43.640
Keep a ham by the bed.

15:50.415 --> 15:52.516
I've almost got this down.
Before going to sleep
at night,

15:52.517 --> 15:57.121
I press "arm-command-5863,"

15:57.122 --> 16:02.293
"perimeter-instant-2-star-4."

16:02.294 --> 16:03.627
2-star-2!

16:03.628 --> 16:05.963
Oh, ok. "2-star-2."

16:05.964 --> 16:09.800
<i>(beeps)</i>
<i>(tim coughing)</i>

16:14.406 --> 16:17.241
I think I could use one
of those mucous cups.

16:18.810 --> 16:22.045
I'll never be able to
work this.
You'll get it.

16:22.046 --> 16:24.782
There's one last security
measure we gotta do before bed.

16:24.783 --> 16:25.750
What?

16:25.751 --> 16:28.118
I'll have to frisk you.

16:31.456 --> 16:33.224
What's the password?

16:33.225 --> 16:35.158
"please."

16:57.949 --> 16:59.950
<i>(alarm sounds)</i>

16:59.951 --> 17:02.786
<i>(recording)</i> <i>get away from</i>

17:02.787 --> 17:05.454

17:07.724 --> 17:09.893
There's someone downstairs!
Uh, uh...

17:09.894 --> 17:12.663
Stay here. I'll go down there.
I'll get him.

17:12.664 --> 17:14.698
Here, wait! Take this.

17:17.502 --> 17:21.271
What am I gonna do,
style him to death?

17:22.507 --> 17:25.541
<i>(tim)</i> who's down there?

17:25.542 --> 17:28.912

Dad!
Brad! What are you
doing down here?

17:38.590 --> 17:40.724
This thing's going crazy.
I can't turn it off.

17:40.725 --> 17:43.093
Honey, it's ok.
It's just brad.

17:43.094 --> 17:47.665
"disarm-command-disarm
8-7-disarm." look at that!

17:47.666 --> 17:51.235
Boy, that was loud.

17:51.236 --> 17:55.406
Relax. Why are you
hugging yourself?

17:55.407 --> 17:58.742
It-it just feels right.

17:58.743 --> 18:01.545
Everybody go back to bed.
The alarm won't go back on.

18:01.546 --> 18:03.681
All right?
All right.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.583
<i>Get away from the house!</i>
<i>The police are on their way!</i>

18:06.584 --> 18:08.985
<i>Get away from the house!</i>

Tim!
<i>(tim)</i> don't panic!

19:08.947 --> 19:12.715
Oh, good god! How much longer
must I endure this madness?

19:12.716 --> 19:16.553
Bells and whistles and little
men popping up at all hours of
the night?

19:16.554 --> 19:18.956
I am so sorry, wilson.
I don't want to upset you.

19:18.957 --> 19:21.792
You're the only neighbor who is
still speaking to us.

19:21.793 --> 19:25.429
Well, I am about one
siren blast away from going
over to the other side.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.231
I'm about ready to join you.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.967
How could you let tim put in
such a ridiculous alarm system?

19:29.968 --> 19:31.802
Well, it was actually
my idea.

19:31.803 --> 19:34.104
Your idea?

19:34.105 --> 19:36.941
Yeah. After you got robbed,
I got scared.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.743
I started imaging horrible
things happening to the family.

19:39.744 --> 19:42.746
Crazy people lurking behind
every door,

19:42.747 --> 19:45.916
Scaring the kids,
taking all our stuff.
Mm-hmm.

19:45.917 --> 19:48.352
You thought that by putting in
a state-of-the-art alarm system,

19:48.353 --> 19:50.421
That you'd
no longer be afraid.

19:50.422 --> 19:54.558
Well, yeah. But now all
I'm afraid of is setting off
this insane system!

19:54.559 --> 19:57.928
Well, jill,
I wouldn't worry about it.

19:57.929 --> 20:03.534
As the physicist edward teller
told me over borscht at
the russian tea room,

20:03.535 --> 20:06.704
Total security has never been
available to anyone.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.872
To expect it is unrealistic.

20:08.873 --> 20:12.676
To imagine that it can exist
is an invite to disaster.

20:12.677 --> 20:16.379
Well, this week would qualify
as a complete disaster.

20:16.380 --> 20:19.216
I wish we could scale
this thing back.

20:19.217 --> 20:22.620
But I can't ask him to do that
after he's put all this effort
into it.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.688
Why don't you present
him with a petition

20:24.689 --> 20:27.491
Signed by all his neighbors
who are sleep-deprived?

20:27.492 --> 20:32.429
Wilson, you know nobody in
this neighborhood ever signs
anything.

20:32.430 --> 20:35.465
Well, jill, there's
always a first time.

20:38.370 --> 20:43.039
All right, all right.
I think I've got the inside
sensors figured out.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.108
Hey, wilson.
Hey.

20:45.109 --> 20:47.611
What do you got there?
A petition from all
the neighbors

20:47.612 --> 20:49.379
Angry about your
security system.

20:49.380 --> 20:52.516
<i>(mock laughter)</i>

20:52.517 --> 20:55.986
Joe paduro? That guy lives,
like, four blocks away.

20:55.987 --> 20:59.623
Well, I think he's still
angry about being hit by
the spaghetti.

21:01.192 --> 21:04.895
Tim, we gotta talk about
scaling this thing back.

21:04.896 --> 21:06.996
You know, this was
partly your idea.

21:06.997 --> 21:10.601
I'll figure it out as soon
as I can get these motion
detectors...

21:10.602 --> 21:12.402
<i>(alarm sounds)</i>

21:12.403 --> 21:13.937
Hey!

21:21.012 --> 21:23.179
Welcome back to another
<i>tool time</i> on location.

21:23.180 --> 21:27.217
Last week we showed you how to
install a state-of-the-art
security system.

21:27.218 --> 21:30.286
Today we'll show you how
to install a more modest system.

21:30.287 --> 21:34.291
And for people whose neighbors
signed a huge petition.

21:36.561 --> 21:40.864
We eliminated 17 or 18 zones
and went with a much smaller
control panel.

21:40.865 --> 21:44.802
Now we have only one
security camera situated
over the front door.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.904
There you go. See that picture?
Very nice.

21:46.905 --> 21:49.807
That's my son brad
with a good friend, jason.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.143
Jason just bought
his first circular saw.

21:53.144 --> 21:54.578
<i>You want your money back?</i>

21:54.579 --> 21:57.014
<i>I decided not to</i>
<i>cheat on the test.</i>

21:57.015 --> 21:59.416
<i>Why not?</i>

21:59.417 --> 22:00.984
<i>Well, first of all</i>
<i>it's wrong.</i>

22:00.985 --> 22:03.220
<i>And if my parents caught me,</i>
<i>they'd kill me.</i>

22:03.221 --> 22:05.789
<i>They'd never catch on.</i>
<i>Especially your dad.</i>

22:05.790 --> 22:07.358
<i>He still thinks</i>
<i>I bought a saw</i>

22:07.359 --> 22:11.060
And that I tape <i>tool time.</i>
I mean...

22:11.061 --> 22:13.062
<i>(tim laughs)</i>

22:13.063 --> 22:15.199
Well, you don't have to tape
<i>tool time</i> now, jason,

22:15.200 --> 22:17.434
Because you're on it live.

22:17.435 --> 22:20.270
And I'll be sending
this tape to your folks.

22:22.540 --> 22:25.942
Did I mention
I'm an orphan, sir?

22:30.415 --> 22:32.149
I think I love you no... Mo...

22:34.285 --> 22:35.685
<i>(director)</i> one more time.

22:35.686 --> 22:37.120
"I love you more at
this moment than ever before."

22:37.121 --> 22:38.521
Something like that.

22:38.522 --> 22:40.991
"I've never loved you as much
as I do at this moment!"

22:40.992 --> 22:42.226
Here we go.

22:42.227 --> 22:44.561
Wow. You're... You're doing
a <i>tool time</i>

22:44.562 --> 22:45.863
Right here in this house?
Oh, yeah.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.399
Whew!

22:49.400 --> 22:50.501
Wow.

22:50.502 --> 22:54.738
That would be your line.
Would it?
