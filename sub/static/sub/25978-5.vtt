[slide projector clicking]

00:20.083 --> 00:21.208
[Elena gasps]

00:21.291 --> 00:23.291
[monitor beeping]

00:26.875 --> 00:29.541
-[Ben] Just breathe, Elena.
-[Elena breathes deeply]

00:31.666 --> 00:34.750
I remember Ryan running down the path
chasing butterflies.

00:36.208 --> 00:37.958
Like he was catching snowflakes.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.125
[panting]

00:48.041 --> 00:50.291
Now, embrace the memory.
Don't back away from it,

00:50.375 --> 00:53.541
but bring your mind into the present,
into this room, here with me.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.250
[exhales deeply]

00:58.541 --> 01:00.333
[Ben] <i>Everything is perfectly safe.</i>

01:03.666 --> 01:07.708
<i>Love is your trigger, remember.</i>
<i>Memories make us who we are.</i>

01:20.625 --> 01:21.750
[Harry] <i>Happiness.</i>

01:22.375 --> 01:23.291
<i>Pride.</i>

01:23.916 --> 01:24.958
<i>Sadness.</i>

01:25.541 --> 01:27.375
I mean, we all feel them, don't we?

01:27.833 --> 01:31.250
Doesn't matter who you are
or what you say, what you do.

01:32.458 --> 01:35.958
I mean, even you and me.
There's emotion in the room, right?

01:37.541 --> 01:38.375
I can feel it.

01:39.666 --> 01:40.583
I know love.

01:41.375 --> 01:42.750
I know I'm young, but...

01:43.625 --> 01:44.500
I know love.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.750
I'm in love. [chuckles softly]

01:48.416 --> 01:51.041
And I used to write these letters,
love letters.

01:51.375 --> 01:54.416
I found it really easy to put down
on paper how I felt and...

01:54.791 --> 01:55.791
mean every word.

01:57.541 --> 02:00.291
Now, I know I'll be a great addition
to your sales team.

02:00.916 --> 02:03.791
"Emotions for every occasion"?
I'm your man.

02:09.208 --> 02:11.375
[woman] You haven't been out in London.
This is your first night.

02:11.458 --> 02:14.416
We are going out. You, me, and June. June?

02:14.666 --> 02:17.625
Some of us are going out tonight.
You guys should come with.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.833
Uh, I would love to,
I really would, but...

02:20.500 --> 02:23.041
-we are so broke, honestly. [laughs]
-[sighs]

02:23.791 --> 02:27.125
Plus, Harry's had a job interview today,
so I think we're just gonna be...

02:27.291 --> 02:30.416
-celebrating, just the two of us, later.
-Okay.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.916
-[chuckles]
-Thanks, though.

02:32.333 --> 02:35.166
[man] Oh, my God. Wait. So my friends
and I are pretty split on this.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.708
-Are they twins or CGI?
-Show me.

02:36.791 --> 02:39.625
-Uh, wait, wait. Three, two, one.
-[man 2] Look, look, look.

02:39.708 --> 02:42.125
-Whoa! Whoa!
-[group laughing]

02:42.208 --> 02:45.083
That is crazy! Play it again.
Play it again. Play it again.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.375
-[men laughing]
-[man 2] That's insane!

02:48.291 --> 02:51.500
-[man] Must be CGI. There's two of them.
-[man 2] No, they're twins!

02:51.583 --> 02:54.416
-[group laughing]
-[woman] Well, there's no way

02:54.500 --> 02:57.833
-that can be real. How is that possible?
-[man] Don't you see that?

02:59.041 --> 03:02.208
-[group gasps, laughing]
-[gasps]

03:02.291 --> 03:04.625
-[woman] Oh, my God!
-[man 3] That is insane!

03:04.708 --> 03:05.833
[woman] No way.

03:08.666 --> 03:09.750
[gasps]

03:09.833 --> 03:11.833
[siren wailing in distance]

03:16.000 --> 03:17.541
-You all right?
-Yeah. You all right?

03:17.625 --> 03:20.416
[Harry] Yep. I'm feeling great!

03:23.208 --> 03:24.625
-Hey.
-[man] Hey.

03:25.791 --> 03:27.625
[Harry] I've got a good feeling
about this one.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.000
Hey.

03:36.958 --> 03:37.875
Hey, what's wrong?

03:39.833 --> 03:40.666
What happened?

03:40.958 --> 03:42.041
[cell phone clicks]

03:45.125 --> 03:45.958
[June] Look.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.916
Nobody's gonna believe this is real.

04:03.625 --> 04:06.708
[sighs] It's the Internet, yeah?

04:07.166 --> 04:10.291
Look, there's weirder stuff out there
than-- than that, right?

04:11.458 --> 04:12.583
[June] Harry, look.

04:14.583 --> 04:17.458
"I know what this is. I can help."

04:18.333 --> 04:19.625
"Passionate Amateur"?

04:24.125 --> 04:25.041
[texting]

04:25.541 --> 04:27.083
"What do you know?

04:28.833 --> 04:30.458
How can you help?"

04:32.500 --> 04:35.250
-[door slams]
-[women laughing, speaking indistinctly]

04:42.625 --> 04:43.833
[Harry] June...

04:51.000 --> 04:52.500
-[sighs]
-[cell phone chimes]

04:54.375 --> 04:57.375
"National Portrait Gallery,
room 11, 5:00 p.m."

05:13.625 --> 05:15.500
[mouse clicking]

05:18.458 --> 05:22.125
-What were you doing, sweetheart?
-Will you take me, too?

05:24.458 --> 05:27.958
[breathing heavily]

05:55.458 --> 05:56.583
[Christine gasps]

06:51.375 --> 06:52.458
[gasps]

07:01.125 --> 07:02.458
[John sighs]

07:09.333 --> 07:11.666
-I've been looking for you, John.
-[John] Yeah?

07:12.541 --> 07:14.041
You haven't answered my calls.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.500
What the hell happened in London?

07:17.458 --> 07:19.625
Nothing. I couldn't find them.

07:20.583 --> 07:24.666
-Do you mind? I have to go.
-Is that alcohol I can smell on you?

07:25.333 --> 07:27.000
-What?
-[Christine] I think it is.

07:27.416 --> 07:30.875
I think you shouldn't be driving.
Why don't you come with me?

07:32.791 --> 07:35.750
-Or I could arrest you in public.
-This is ridiculous.

07:36.208 --> 07:37.333
[Christine] Let's go.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.041
Now.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.375
[Harry] Listen, I know you're hopeful,
but this could be anyone.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.583
-[sighs] Yeah, it could be Steinar.
-Exactly.

07:51.875 --> 07:54.000
So if you see him, don't run, okay?

07:54.333 --> 07:56.333
Just stay in plain sight in the crowd.

07:56.791 --> 07:58.500
He won't be able to try anything there.

07:59.541 --> 08:01.041
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

08:14.958 --> 08:17.041
[man]
When this portrait was first exhibited

08:17.125 --> 08:19.166
at Whitehall Palace in 1951...

08:20.375 --> 08:21.708
it created a sensation.

08:24.083 --> 08:27.541
The warping of the king's face
was shocking...

08:28.500 --> 08:29.333
subversive...

08:31.375 --> 08:34.333
unlike anything the English public
had seen before.

08:35.541 --> 08:36.500
But...

08:37.791 --> 08:40.666
when you view the painting
through this viewfinder...

08:42.458 --> 08:43.375
you'll see that...

08:44.625 --> 08:48.041
Edward VI isn't the fun house freak
he appears to be.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.791
He's just like you and me.

09:12.250 --> 09:16.208
-Excuse me. Could we join the tour?
-[man] Oh, I don't work here.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.916
I'm just a passionate amateur.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.916
-Who are you?
-[man] Francis Walsingham.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.250
Famous spymaster to Queen Elizabeth I.

09:32.541 --> 09:35.250
Even this painting has its secrets.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.250
There's a second face under Walsingham's.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.833
If you look very closely...

09:42.666 --> 09:43.666
you can see her.

09:51.750 --> 09:52.958
-Boo.
-[June gasps]

10:04.208 --> 10:05.250
[June] That's her.

10:08.833 --> 10:11.250
So we meet again. I'm Kam.

10:13.416 --> 10:15.000
How did you do that so easily?

10:15.875 --> 10:17.625
Well, I shift whenever I want.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.625
-So that's what it's called, a-- a shift?
-Yeah.

10:21.958 --> 10:25.541
-So when did it happen for the first time?
-About a week ago.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.625
[exhales]
You must be reeling, both of you.

10:31.708 --> 10:33.041
Where are you staying?

10:35.333 --> 10:36.250
In a hostel.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.541
[June] But it's not safe.

10:39.458 --> 10:41.208
Do you know anyone else in London?

10:41.833 --> 10:43.083
[sighs]

10:44.791 --> 10:49.500
Well, I can see that you're scared and,
believe me, I was scared, too.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.333
And I know what it's like,
not knowing who to trust.

10:56.583 --> 10:57.583
So...

10:58.583 --> 11:02.250
if you need somewhere to stay,
just for a few days, and a bit of a...

11:03.208 --> 11:05.833
crash course
in how to handle yourself, then...

11:07.708 --> 11:08.958
I'm prepared to do that.

11:09.416 --> 11:10.458
[chuckles softly]

11:13.833 --> 11:15.333
So how do we know we can trust you?

11:16.916 --> 11:19.916
Meeting new people hasn't exactly
worked out for us so far.

11:20.333 --> 11:25.958
Me neither. This is a big risk for me,
too, so... it's up to you.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.041
If you prefer...

11:28.750 --> 11:31.333
I could just walk away,
and we never see each other again.

11:31.416 --> 11:33.333
-[inhales sharply]
-[Kam] Or...

11:37.791 --> 11:41.041
Here is my address.

11:49.416 --> 11:50.958
I'm so glad that I met you.

11:54.416 --> 11:55.500
See ya.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.375
[clock ticking loudly]

12:03.833 --> 12:05.500
[Christine]
I've got all the time in the world.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.250
So I'm gonna ask you again.

12:08.916 --> 12:12.000
Where was Elena
on the night of the Pennines Five?

12:12.083 --> 12:14.750
I can't for the life of me
see why you're bringing this up.

12:19.666 --> 12:21.625
We had a fight, she took her bag,
disappeared.

12:22.250 --> 12:24.583
-And she didn't come back.
-You know all this.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.875
We picked up your Land Rover
on CCTV, remember?

12:28.083 --> 12:30.500
Near the canal,
where two of the victims were found.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.666
-Out looking for her, wasn't I?
-I can tell you where she was.

12:34.625 --> 12:35.916
In fact, I can show you.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.958
She was in the same place as Lewis

12:40.041 --> 12:42.458
in the last moments of his life
as he knew it.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.041
There.

12:48.708 --> 12:50.500
I don't know what you're pointing at.

12:51.208 --> 12:54.250
You're telling me that's not Elena
in Lewis's reflection?

13:08.125 --> 13:09.000
I need a word.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.333
-Not now, Doug. I'm busy.
-My office, now.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.166
-I'm in the middle--
-Now!

13:13.875 --> 13:15.083
[Christine sighs]

13:29.666 --> 13:32.041
-[indistinct chatter]
-[phones ringing]

13:36.500 --> 13:38.000
-What do you think you're playing at?
-Listen--

13:38.083 --> 13:40.000
The custody sergeant said
you didn't even breathalyze him.

13:40.416 --> 13:44.125
That you wouldn't let anyone sit in.
You cannot abuse your position this way!

13:44.916 --> 13:46.583
Whatever's going on between you and John--

13:46.666 --> 13:48.291
-He knows something.
-About Harry?

13:48.750 --> 13:50.583
About Lewis. The Pennines Five.

13:50.666 --> 13:53.583
-You've got to be kidding me.
-You saw what happened to that nurse.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.083
And that clip, it brought it all back.
Gave me bloody nightmares, again.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.166
But this is out of our jurisdiction now!

13:59.916 --> 14:02.625
If you keep behaving like this,
I can't protect you anymore.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.666
Sometimes I think you don't even want
to find out what happened to Lewis.

14:09.916 --> 14:10.833
Christine...

14:11.791 --> 14:14.791
I am sorry to do this,
but you have had a warning,

14:15.208 --> 14:17.083
and now you need to step back.

14:17.625 --> 14:20.708
No, you don't understand.
I think we missed something.

14:20.791 --> 14:23.875
Detective Inspector Polk,
I am suspending you indefinitely.

14:24.291 --> 14:25.166
What?

14:31.125 --> 14:33.958
-At least let me finish interviewing him.
-I'm letting John go.

14:34.083 --> 14:37.083
You've got nothing on him.
Go home, Christine. Now!

14:43.458 --> 14:46.875
-[subway cars rattling]
-[gulls calling]

14:47.708 --> 14:49.708
[elevator rattles]

14:52.875 --> 14:53.750
Hey.

14:54.708 --> 14:57.125
Let's not tell her too much, okay?

14:58.041 --> 14:59.041
The attack.

14:59.583 --> 15:02.041
Especially the stuff about your mum.
Let's keep that between ourselves.

15:02.125 --> 15:03.291
Yeah, okay.

15:06.166 --> 15:09.291
I just can't believe
I've found someone like me. [chuckles]

15:10.000 --> 15:11.500
She's still a stranger.

15:12.625 --> 15:13.958
[elevator bell dings]

15:14.041 --> 15:16.750
-Hey, guys. Come on in. Come on.
-[Harry] Hey.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.166
-[Kam] Andrew?
-[Andrew] Yes?

15:19.250 --> 15:21.125
-[Kam] They're here.
-[Andrew] All right.

15:21.208 --> 15:23.291
-[pop music playing on stereo]
-[sighs]

15:25.958 --> 15:28.125
Andrew, this is...

15:28.875 --> 15:30.375
-June.
-[Andrew] June.

15:30.458 --> 15:31.833
-[Kam] And Harry.
-[Andrew] Harry.

15:32.041 --> 15:32.875
I...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.583
-believe you've already met me, yeah?
-[laughs] Yeah.

15:36.666 --> 15:37.666
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.375
-Nice to meet you.
-[Kam] Come on, I'll show you your room.

15:43.125 --> 15:44.833
-[Harry chuckles softly]
-Like food?

15:44.916 --> 15:47.125
-Um, yeah. Yeah.
-Come help me cook.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.458
[water running]

16:01.625 --> 16:02.666
[sighs]

16:04.625 --> 16:05.916
[exhales deeply]

16:13.541 --> 16:15.291
-[June] Berserkers?
-[Kam] Mm-hmm.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.458
It's Old Norse for "bear shirts."

16:17.541 --> 16:19.666
They were warriors
who went into battle naked,

16:19.750 --> 16:21.333
except for bloodied animal skins.

16:22.333 --> 16:23.875
I wonder what it would have looked like

16:23.958 --> 16:26.708
to see them on a brow of a hill
surrounding your village.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.250
God, I bet they were beautiful.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.333
-[June chuckles softly]
-[pots clanging]

16:31.750 --> 16:35.875
It says the berserkers were forces
of complete annihilation.

16:35.958 --> 16:38.625
Yeah, with voracious sexual appetites.

16:38.708 --> 16:42.083
Makes your run-of-the-mill Vikings
look like Cub Scouts.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.041
[both chuckle]

16:43.375 --> 16:44.583
Look at this.

16:44.666 --> 16:48.041
"The condition began with shaking,
a chattering of the teeth,

16:48.125 --> 16:51.250
and then the face and body convulsed
and changed."

16:52.666 --> 16:54.791
-Changed into what?
-Bears.

16:55.166 --> 16:58.666
Wolves.
The animals of the skins that they wore.

16:58.750 --> 17:02.458
These crazy bastards were shifting
in the ninth century.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.125
The gene passed down from father to son.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.958
Yeah, but all this is just legend, though,
isn't it?

17:09.166 --> 17:12.250
Well, it's not really
about the boys anymore, is it?

17:12.583 --> 17:14.208
It only seems to affect women.

17:14.291 --> 17:15.458
[Andrew] Food is ready.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.041
Come on, let's eat.

17:22.416 --> 17:26.250
-It's amazing. No-- No pain, no fear.
-[Harry] And then they went berserk.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.500
[stammers] You don't get it.
I mean, this...

17:29.333 --> 17:31.375
This could be where it all started.

17:31.541 --> 17:34.416
You know, all that anger,
that-- that fight or flight.

17:35.166 --> 17:38.166
You know, the berserkers,
they-- they turned into animals

17:38.291 --> 17:40.625
so that they could do anything to anyone.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.750
God, and Kam,
she just knows so much about...

17:44.375 --> 17:45.416
everything.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.666
Okay.

17:48.375 --> 17:51.125
So, what did you tell her?
[exhales deeply]

17:51.208 --> 17:53.375
Mm... Nothing she didn't know already.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.875
And what did you think of Andrew?

17:56.125 --> 17:58.625
Yeah, yeah.

17:58.958 --> 18:00.833
He seems like a pretty good guy.

18:01.791 --> 18:04.166
Although it's very weird
wearing his pajamas.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.750
[both laugh]

18:18.500 --> 18:20.125
[breathing heavily]

18:23.833 --> 18:25.083
[grunts]

18:25.916 --> 18:27.791
[panting]

18:28.791 --> 18:29.625
[sighs]

18:34.458 --> 18:37.333
[Ryan] Hey, what's going on?
Where've you been?

18:37.708 --> 18:38.583
Sit down.

18:40.166 --> 18:41.750
I have to tell you something...

18:43.000 --> 18:44.833
before you hear it from someone else.

18:47.458 --> 18:48.583
It's about June...

18:51.041 --> 18:52.041
and your mother.

18:55.208 --> 18:56.375
[Ryan] Memories...

18:56.916 --> 18:57.875
of me and Mum...

18:58.958 --> 19:01.541
traveling together before we came here.

19:02.666 --> 19:05.333
Sometimes she'd be gone
for days at a time...

19:06.125 --> 19:09.083
and then these strangers
would be looking after me.

19:11.166 --> 19:14.000
Except they weren't strangers.
They knew me.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.500
<i>Really </i>knew me.

19:19.750 --> 19:22.166
I thought they were dreams.
[chuckles softly]

19:23.708 --> 19:25.541
But they were all her, weren't they?

19:26.416 --> 19:27.583
They were all Mum.

19:29.583 --> 19:30.750
[John sighs]

19:32.958 --> 19:35.458
[sighs, voice trembling]
You know, the night she left...

19:36.791 --> 19:38.208
I saw things.

19:39.541 --> 19:41.833
-Weird things.
-Why didn't you tell me?

19:41.958 --> 19:43.583
[sighs] Honestly?

19:44.916 --> 19:46.166
[breathes deeply]

19:46.958 --> 19:49.583
Because... I needed to hate you.

19:50.875 --> 19:51.791
[sighs]

19:52.125 --> 19:53.541
I needed you to be lying.

19:55.541 --> 19:57.625
I needed you to have driven Mum away.

19:59.208 --> 20:01.416
I didn't want to believe
that she had a choice.

20:01.583 --> 20:02.458
She didn't.

20:04.166 --> 20:08.166
I should have told you sooner,
both of you, but I didn't know how to.

20:09.208 --> 20:13.000
-Or whether June was even the same as her.
-You know, I thought I was crazy.

20:14.916 --> 20:19.791
After she left that night, I thought,
"Stay safe, and stay at home."

20:20.583 --> 20:21.416
[scoffs]

20:23.208 --> 20:24.750
I ended up exactly like her.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.083
Locked myself away in that annex...

20:29.875 --> 20:32.833
-like a prisoner.
-That's not what I wanted for you, ever.

20:33.208 --> 20:36.166
You know, I understand
what you were trying to do for June now.

20:36.750 --> 20:37.625
Fair Isle...

20:38.333 --> 20:40.500
routine, isolation...

20:41.000 --> 20:41.916
[scoffs]

20:43.458 --> 20:45.541
You cared and Mum didn't.

20:47.708 --> 20:50.375
She ruined people's lives,
and she just ran away!

20:50.458 --> 20:51.958
No, she loved you.

20:52.625 --> 20:53.541
[sniffles]

20:53.625 --> 20:55.125
She loved you both.

20:56.291 --> 20:58.416
But your mother was different, and...

21:02.750 --> 21:04.541
[voice wavering]
And I couldn't help her...

21:08.541 --> 21:09.500
or June.

21:17.208 --> 21:18.291
I let you all down.

21:24.458 --> 21:25.625
And I'm sorry.

21:35.750 --> 21:37.291
[Kam] <i>She just upped and left?</i>

21:38.750 --> 21:41.333
So, how long has it been
since you last saw her?

21:41.916 --> 21:42.791
Three years.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.166
She's your mother.

21:46.166 --> 21:48.166
I don't know how she could do that to you.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.416
No, it's not like that, honestly.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.208
She's a good person.

21:53.208 --> 21:54.083
She left you.

21:55.166 --> 21:56.166
Yeah, but she's...

21:57.541 --> 21:59.791
She's trying to find me.
She wants us to...

22:00.625 --> 22:01.958
She wants us to be together.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.458
It doesn't sound like it.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.208
-Look.
-[beeps]

22:14.291 --> 22:17.041
[Elena on recording] <i>June... my girl.</i>

22:19.291 --> 22:20.875
<i>You're about to turn 16.</i>

22:22.333 --> 22:25.750
<i>I want to be there to help you understand</i>
<i>the things you might be feeling.</i>

22:27.041 --> 22:29.833
<i>Things that...</i>
<i>might be happening to you.</i>

22:33.500 --> 22:35.875
<i>-She </i>sent that to you?
-Yeah.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.333
Aren't you angry?

22:42.125 --> 22:43.291
No, I just...

22:45.041 --> 22:45.875
[sighs]

22:46.291 --> 22:47.791
I think I just want to see her.

22:48.708 --> 22:50.125
Are you sure about that?

22:51.916 --> 22:53.958
Yeah. Yeah.

22:57.083 --> 22:58.083
Okay.

23:00.916 --> 23:04.708
[Kam] <i>So it says that, four months ago,</i>
<i>a nun was found in a coma</i>

23:04.791 --> 23:07.500
in her convent in Hordaland, Norway.
Vibrating eyes,

23:07.791 --> 23:08.833
no signs of injury,

23:08.916 --> 23:11.875
and she recovered spontaneously
with no memory of events.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.333
Police were concerned for the well-being
of another nun

23:14.416 --> 23:15.833
that went missing on the same day.

23:15.916 --> 23:18.416
-So you can read this?
-I told you, I'm an enthusiast.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.041
I collect this stuff.

23:20.791 --> 23:22.208
Any signs that there are...

23:23.000 --> 23:24.333
any more of us out there.

23:24.833 --> 23:26.166
[gasps]

23:28.541 --> 23:30.416
That's her. That's my mum.

23:30.625 --> 23:31.458
I know.

23:32.458 --> 23:36.333
Even though it's not the clearest photo,
I recognized her from your video.

23:37.375 --> 23:39.958
-But that's not her name, though.
-Well, it wouldn't be,

23:40.250 --> 23:41.583
if she was in hiding.

23:43.000 --> 23:43.958
[gasps softly]

23:47.000 --> 23:48.041
She's like us.

23:56.375 --> 23:57.208
[Harry] Morning.

23:58.250 --> 23:59.083
Thanks.

23:59.958 --> 24:00.791
Hey.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.041
[softly] Hey.

24:02.583 --> 24:04.166
[sighs] What's happening?

24:05.166 --> 24:06.375
I was...

24:07.458 --> 24:09.791
I was just telling June that...

24:10.458 --> 24:12.625
I think that we found each other
for a reason.

24:13.958 --> 24:14.916
[Harry] Ah.

24:15.416 --> 24:16.291
Right.

24:16.708 --> 24:20.000
You know, yesterday at the gallery,
you... shifted.

24:22.125 --> 24:24.458
You did it on your own,
and you weren't scared.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.458
How?

24:27.666 --> 24:28.750
How did you do that?

24:31.708 --> 24:33.416
Do you want me to show you both?

24:37.875 --> 24:40.208
[gulls calling]

24:44.958 --> 24:47.458
[breathes deeply]

24:53.125 --> 24:55.833
-[can rattles]
-[indistinct chatter]

24:57.041 --> 24:58.041
[sighs]

25:02.041 --> 25:05.875
[inhales deeply, clears throat]

25:06.500 --> 25:08.500
-[dial tone sounds]
-[sighs]

25:12.833 --> 25:14.333
[cell phone rings]

25:16.666 --> 25:17.875
Steinar, is that you?

25:19.833 --> 25:21.375
I-- I messed up.

25:22.583 --> 25:24.666
<i>Ben, listen to me.</i>

25:26.541 --> 25:29.083
June's not like the other women
at Sanctum.

25:31.083 --> 25:33.125
She can get into your mind...

25:34.000 --> 25:35.083
your memories.

25:36.041 --> 25:38.083
<i>She's everything you're looking for.</i>

25:39.916 --> 25:40.916
Where is she?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.625
[sighs] I-- I don't know.

25:43.541 --> 25:45.458
Somewhere in London.

25:45.750 --> 25:46.958
<i>She has my phone.</i>

25:47.916 --> 25:49.375
Listen, you stay where you are.

25:49.458 --> 25:52.041
<i>Stay exactly where you are,</i>
<i>and I will call you.</i>

25:52.833 --> 25:53.708
Okay.

25:53.791 --> 25:54.958
-[sighs]
-[call disconnects]

25:57.291 --> 25:58.291
[sighs]

26:01.583 --> 26:02.708
[exhales deeply]

26:05.416 --> 26:07.541
[Kam] <i>The best place to start is</i>
<i>with your trigger.</i>

26:07.958 --> 26:10.500
What were you feeling before you shifted?

26:12.666 --> 26:14.000
Fear, mostly.

26:14.416 --> 26:15.375
[Kam] Mine's pain.

26:16.166 --> 26:17.500
But that's what it's all about.

26:17.583 --> 26:19.958
Understanding the emotion
behind the shift.

26:20.583 --> 26:22.916
After that,
there's really nothing to be afraid of.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.666
Hey...

26:25.958 --> 26:29.458
Listen to me, June.
We are unique creatures.

26:29.875 --> 26:33.416
Don't ever be ashamed of what you are.
You have to embrace it.

26:36.375 --> 26:39.208
Oh, and, uh, you'll be wearing
the same clothes, so think ahead.

26:40.833 --> 26:41.708
Ready?

26:48.625 --> 26:49.666
[Kam inhales sharply]

26:51.458 --> 26:53.291
[Kam panting]

26:55.416 --> 26:58.791
[moans, gasping]

27:23.083 --> 27:24.666
See how easy it can be...

27:26.708 --> 27:28.291
if you have complete trust?

27:29.916 --> 27:31.291
[Harry] <i>I don't know. It just...</i>

27:32.333 --> 27:33.875
It just felt like she was just...

27:34.750 --> 27:36.791
-using him.
-What? No.

27:37.791 --> 27:40.250
No, this is something
that they do together.

27:41.166 --> 27:43.958
And they're not scared of it.
They can control it.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.500
-It's not hurting anyone.
-She...

27:48.083 --> 27:50.458
She burned herself
trying to make it happen.

27:51.250 --> 27:54.041
-You did see that, right?
-Look, you said so yourself,

27:54.125 --> 27:56.625
we need to find out
what's happening to me, and...

27:56.958 --> 27:57.833
Kam... I--

28:00.041 --> 28:04.291
I don't know. She might be my best chance,
my-- my only chance, to find that out.

28:07.416 --> 28:09.833
Look, she's gonna help me find my mum,
Harry.

28:14.333 --> 28:15.333
[sighs] Okay.

28:17.666 --> 28:19.125
Okay, so...

28:20.125 --> 28:21.833
So we ask her to help you.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.916
Really help you.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.083
And then we leave.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.333
Yeah, okay.

28:33.833 --> 28:36.041
Just promise me
you'll never do that to me.

28:36.125 --> 28:37.083
[scoffs]

28:37.333 --> 28:39.875
I would never do anything
you didn't want me to do.

28:40.875 --> 28:41.708
Ever.

28:52.125 --> 28:53.458
[Runa] What are you doing?

28:55.666 --> 28:57.458
[Ben] Just getting things in order.

29:00.375 --> 29:01.625
I am going to London.

29:04.666 --> 29:05.500
For her?

29:06.541 --> 29:10.041
There's some complications with Steinar,
so I have to bring June here myself.

29:12.083 --> 29:15.416
Are you going to leave us now,
when I need you here more than ever?

29:15.750 --> 29:18.458
I hit shift state
for the first time in years.

29:18.541 --> 29:20.500
Yes, and the girls mustn't know.

29:20.583 --> 29:22.583
-I could be dangerous. You know I could.
-No.

29:22.666 --> 29:25.750
If you take care of yourself
and you keep calm, you'll be all right.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.208
I'll be gone for two days at the most.

29:27.291 --> 29:28.291
-Two days?
-Mm-hmm.

29:28.833 --> 29:32.500
-Don't leave me.
-The last thing I want to do is leave you,

29:32.583 --> 29:36.500
but we may not get another chance
to help June and put things right.

29:38.291 --> 29:39.125
Oh...

29:41.458 --> 29:42.416
[sighs]

29:46.333 --> 29:47.208
Okay.

29:48.083 --> 29:48.958
[sighs]

29:50.000 --> 29:52.208
Just promise me you'll wake me
before you go.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.083
[chuckles softly]

29:56.833 --> 30:00.375
[footsteps retreating]

30:04.291 --> 30:06.041
[Sigrid] <i>But Papa hadn't chosen us.</i>

30:07.250 --> 30:09.125
<i>He was packed and ready to leave.</i>

30:12.208 --> 30:14.583
<i>It doesn't mean that I love you any less.</i>

30:14.666 --> 30:17.750
-[audio stops]
-[player clicks, rewinds]

30:19.541 --> 30:22.333
<i>It doesn't mean that I love you any less.</i>

30:22.916 --> 30:24.375
[player clicks, rewinds]

30:24.458 --> 30:27.208
<i>It doesn't mean that I love you any less.</i>

30:29.166 --> 30:32.125
-[Sigrid] You're leaving.
-[Ben] Yes, just for a few days.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.625
June's ready to come here,
and she needs my help.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.375
Um, but I'm supposed to be leaving.
There is still so much to organize.

30:41.375 --> 30:44.250
Do I stay in Norway?
I don't have any money.

30:44.791 --> 30:47.791
How do I get a job?
I don't even have a place to stay.

30:48.041 --> 30:50.583
All exciting challenges to face, hmm?

30:52.250 --> 30:53.125
Yes.

30:54.041 --> 30:54.875
Exciting.

46:57.875 --> 46:59.000
Look at your face.

46:59.916 --> 47:02.041
-Where is he?
-[chuckles softly]

47:02.750 --> 47:03.916
Where's Harry?

47:07.541 --> 47:08.583
Please.

47:09.458 --> 47:10.375
He's here.

47:13.666 --> 47:16.416
-I'm here.
-Oh, please, Kam. This isn't funny.

47:17.541 --> 47:20.416
[sighs] Please, get out of him.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.666
You should see what he really thinks.

47:27.041 --> 47:30.208
He got what he wanted
out of your body, and, um...

47:31.166 --> 47:33.083
I hate to tell you this, but...

47:35.625 --> 47:37.125
he thought you'd be better.

47:40.625 --> 47:41.625
[Kam sighs]

47:42.000 --> 47:43.291
It won't last.

47:44.333 --> 47:45.333
Trust me.

47:46.666 --> 47:47.958
I can feel it.

47:49.166 --> 47:50.333
You're a liar.

47:52.125 --> 47:54.416
You don't feel anything.

Harry!

Harry? [grunts]

Come on. Come on.

48:30.333 --> 48:33.000

Let him go.

49:14.666 --> 49:16.875
Look at me. Look at me!

49:18.958 --> 49:20.166
Are you okay?

49:23.666 --> 49:24.958
Wait, what's happening?

-What's happening?
-Come on.

[both grunt]

49:30.791 --> 49:31.958
[Harry] What happened?

49:33.083 --> 49:34.166
We need to leave.

49:41.916 --> 49:44.000
Harry, wait. I-- I left my phone.
We have to go back.

49:44.750 --> 49:45.625
No.

49:46.375 --> 49:48.875
Forget it. It doesn't matter. Come on.
Let's just go.

49:49.250 --> 49:50.208
No. Hey, wait.

49:50.583 --> 49:52.125
You don't understand.

49:52.208 --> 49:54.250
Look, I--
I spoke to my mum last night.

49:54.500 --> 49:55.916
She said to stay in London,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.416
and that someone's gonna come
and get me, a-- a doctor.

49:58.750 --> 49:59.625
Are you kidding me?

50:00.500 --> 50:01.625
What? No. I--

50:02.833 --> 50:05.125
This is my chance to stop this.

50:05.916 --> 50:06.791
No.

50:07.625 --> 50:10.041
No, no, no, this is--
this is too much for us.

No.

50:20.416 --> 50:21.416
No, I've had enough.

50:21.500 --> 50:23.208
We're not doing it anymore.
Neither are you.

-Come on, let's just go.
-Hey! Harry, stop!

50:25.375 --> 50:28.125
No! Come on! Come on, let's just go!

50:29.500 --> 50:33.416
I just spoke to my mother
for the first time in three years.

50:33.833 --> 50:35.750
If I want to see her,
it's got nothing to do with you.

50:35.833 --> 50:37.875
-Nothing to do with me?
-[scoffs]

50:37.958 --> 50:41.333
I'm the only one who's stuck by you.
What happened back there?

50:41.416 --> 50:44.666
-I don't know.
-No, you do know. I'm not stupid.

50:44.750 --> 50:46.125
Someone shifted into me.

50:47.583 --> 50:49.041
That shouldn't have happened.

50:57.833 --> 50:58.666
Was it you?

51:04.000 --> 51:07.333
June, just please tell me. Was it you?

51:13.875 --> 51:17.791
-I don't even know who you are anymore.
-No, but you know what I am, don't you?
