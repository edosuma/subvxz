of that bullshit

is that swimming never became

Today, 70% of black Americans
don't know how to swim.

black 11 year olds

04:19.120 --> 04:21.606
among poor Jewish people
in urban neighborhoods.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.333

is relatively inexpensive,

04:24.367 --> 04:26.611

a field.

04:26.645 --> 04:29.130

of the inner cities,

more basketball.

successful and educated.

09:09.445 --> 09:11.067
[wild guitar riff][canned laughter]

09:11.102 --> 09:13.691
So American went
from a country

09:13.725 --> 09:15.209
that despised Asians

09:15.244 --> 09:16.486
to one that held them up

09:16.521 --> 09:19.144
as a shining example
of assimilation.

09:19.179 --> 09:22.251
And this self-fulfilling
prophecy resulted

09:22.285 --> 09:24.736
in the "model minority" myth.

09:24.771 --> 09:26.704
And the most sinister part
of this myth is

09:26.738 --> 09:29.120
it was used to put
other minorities down.

09:29.154 --> 09:31.053
And it's still holding

09:39.855 --> 09:41.960
It's a sitcom thing.

09:41.995 --> 09:44.584
In the 1960s,
government officials

09:44.618 --> 09:46.275
looked at socio-economic data

09:46.309 --> 09:48.070
from African American
communities

09:48.104 --> 09:50.797
and contrasted it
to the so-called

09:50.831 --> 09:53.765
"family values and stability"
of Asian Americans.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.940
Now, this fueled
racist claims

09:55.974 --> 09:58.632
that black people had
no one to blame but themselves

09:58.667 --> 10:00.945
if they experienced poverty

10:00.979 --> 10:02.463
and other social
disadvantages.

10:02.498 --> 10:04.949
Conservatives went on
to use these claims

10:04.983 --> 10:07.779
to justify making cuts
to many essential

10:07.814 --> 10:10.264
social programs
for African Americans

10:10.299 --> 10:12.957
and other disadvantaged

against civil rights.

10:25.728 --> 10:27.972

you helped Asian people.

10:28.006 --> 10:29.663
Why can't you see that?

10:29.698 --> 10:32.562
And the model minority myth
hurts Asian people too.

10:32.597 --> 10:35.324
If an Asian American student
is struggling in school,

10:35.358 --> 10:38.638
many teachers assume that they
don't really need extra help.

10:38.672 --> 10:39.984
And it's not true
that all Asians

10:40.018 --> 10:42.158
are crazy rich
and successful.

10:42.193 --> 10:44.402
The poverty rate
for Asian Americans

10:44.436 --> 10:46.991
is actually higher than
the national average.

10:47.025 --> 10:48.786
And frankly,
it's kinda ridiculous

10:48.820 --> 10:50.546
that we lump people
from so many different

10:50.580 --> 10:52.582

as "Asian."

to "act like a man"

so restrictive.

We were all brought up
believing that the only way

17:20.418 --> 17:23.387
to be a real man is
to live out this stereotype,

17:23.421 --> 17:24.905
but it's not true.

17:24.940 --> 17:26.597
There are so many
different ways

17:26.631 --> 17:29.117
for us to be men
if we choose to be.

17:29.151 --> 17:31.912
But you make it
sound so easy.

17:31.947 --> 17:34.605
Well, Rick, I don't think
it's easy for anyone.

17:34.639 --> 17:36.193
It definitely wasn't for me.

17:36.227 --> 17:38.091
But one thing
that men can do

17:38.126 --> 17:40.369
is start reflecting on where
these ideas of manhood

17:40.404 --> 17:41.715
even come from.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.476
Personally,
I learned a lot

17:43.510 --> 17:45.409
by reading and listening
to women.

17:45.443 --> 17:47.480
And I have to add
I couldn't have

17:47.514 --> 17:49.102
thought through these issues
without the help

17:49.137 --> 17:51.104
of the women
who work on our show.

17:51.139 --> 17:53.934
[canned applause]

17:53.969 --> 17:55.384
And none of us are perfect.

17:55.419 --> 17:56.765
It takes a lot of work

17:56.799 --> 17:58.594
to unlearn how
you've been socialized.

17:58.629 --> 18:00.803
But there's actually
a lot of strength

18:00.838 --> 18:02.426
in being vulnerable.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.773
If we can model
that vulnerability

18:04.807 --> 18:06.809
and hold each other
accountable

18:06.844 --> 18:10.123
when we see other men
performing hurtful behavior,

18:10.158 --> 18:12.229
that's how we can take
the first step.

18:12.263 --> 18:14.507
You're right.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.129
Pork Chop,
I don't think

18:16.164 --> 18:18.649
the cracks you've been making
about Carmen are appropriate.

18:18.683 --> 18:20.237
And I think you should
start examining

18:20.271 --> 18:22.618

to say things like that.

19:05.868 --> 19:06.973
Wade, thank you so much

19:07.007 --> 19:09.182
for being on our sitcom,
we really appreciate it.

19:09.217 --> 19:10.908
We're family, brother.
Thank you for having me.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.565
You're the perfect person
to talk to us about this,

19:12.599 --> 19:14.808
because you used to play
for the NFL.

19:14.843 --> 19:16.500
But now you're known for
your work on race,

19:16.534 --> 19:18.536
gender, toxic masculinity.

19:18.571 --> 19:20.745
So you've talked a lot
about how feminist books

19:20.780 --> 19:23.852
are what helped you begin to
reexamine gender roles.

19:23.886 --> 19:25.094
If I wanted to read

19:25.129 --> 19:26.820
one of those books now,
what should I start with?

19:26.855 --> 19:28.684
So if there's one book,

19:28.719 --> 19:30.099
read this bell hooks book:

19:30.134 --> 19:32.032
"Feminist Theory:
From Margin to Center".

19:32.067 --> 19:34.828
So what I learned was that
the root of homophobia

19:34.863 --> 19:37.555
was sexism, and that changed
my entire life.

19:37.590 --> 19:40.213
I was like, "Wow, everything
that I've thought

19:40.248 --> 19:42.595
that was about men was
actually about women."

19:42.629 --> 19:46.875
When we're calling other men
sexist or homophobic terms,

19:46.909 --> 19:48.877
we're really talking
about women.

19:48.911 --> 19:50.361
But when we're doing that,

19:50.396 --> 19:52.674
we're unnecessarily limiting

19:52.708 --> 19:55.055
the range of things
that men can be.

19:55.090 --> 19:57.713
Yeah, and you also
always put a woman

19:57.748 --> 20:01.061
or "acting like a woman"
in the pejorative sense, right?

20:01.096 --> 20:03.132
[Adam]
Yeah.If I do anything

20:03.167 --> 20:04.962
that can be perceived
as feminine

20:04.996 --> 20:07.102
or perceived that women do,

20:07.136 --> 20:09.622
that it is a negative,
awful thing.

20:09.656 --> 20:13.384
And then that makes
men specifically only have

20:13.419 --> 20:17.077
a very tiny window of how
we can show up in the world.

20:17.112 --> 20:20.288
And that feels suffocating.

20:20.322 --> 20:22.738
How can men get over that
and start having

20:22.773 --> 20:24.602
real conversations
with each other?

20:24.637 --> 20:26.570
The number one thing
I tell men to do

20:26.604 --> 20:28.917
is just be honest
with themselves first, right?

20:28.951 --> 20:31.299
I could never be honest
with you, Adam,

20:31.333 --> 20:34.094
as another human being
if I'm never honest

20:34.129 --> 20:35.579
with myself first, right?

20:35.613 --> 20:37.374
I think when it comes
to gender equality,

20:37.408 --> 20:40.480
we have to own the fact
that we have been socialized

20:40.515 --> 20:42.551
to believe certain things
about women

20:42.586 --> 20:44.967
which impacts what
we think about gay men,

20:45.002 --> 20:46.383
about trans folks, right?

20:46.417 --> 20:49.282
Like, can we actually learn
about people who aren't like us

20:49.317 --> 20:51.595
and then we immediately learn
about ourselves.

20:51.629 --> 20:53.113
Well, I'm really appreciative
that you're out there

21:06.023 --> 21:07.783
Yeah. You know,
maybe it's time

21:07.818 --> 21:09.302
that we stopped looking
at ourselves

21:09.337 --> 21:10.821
as "one of each"

21:10.855 --> 21:13.099
and more like a group
of individuals

21:13.133 --> 21:15.170

by their racial

21:15.204 --> 21:16.585

21:16.620 --> 21:18.794
That we're created by
cultural and historical forces

21:18.829 --> 21:20.486

out of these characters

21:26.630 --> 21:29.322

deconstructing them.

de-spiced my spicy Latina.

21:44.889 --> 21:47.306

21:47.340 --> 21:49.963
with our culture,

even megastars like

that was terrible.

realized it was hurtful,

Um, well, so
the model minority myth

23:18.189 --> 23:19.915

stereotype that's--

right now since 9/11
