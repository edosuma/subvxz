WEBVTT

00:09.476 --> 00:14.613
We are on the set
of "space werewolves."
( squeaks )

00:14.615 --> 00:16.382
It's a dream come true.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.950
Pinch me.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.885
Ow.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.554
I said pinch,
not punch.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.324
I gave you
what you needed.

00:26.393 --> 00:29.361
Chill out, munch.
Act like you belong here.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.532
It's ratchet!
It's tristan's copilot ratchet!

00:33.534 --> 00:36.201
I love him so much.
I can't breathe,
I can't breathe!

00:36.903 --> 00:38.971
No no no.
No!

00:38.973 --> 00:41.273
Do not touch.

00:41.275 --> 00:44.276
Your sister was nice enough
to invite us to her movie set

00:44.278 --> 00:47.379
For the production kickoff.
Do not call attention
to yourselves.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.480
Oh uh!

00:50.850 --> 00:52.551
Boys, I said don't touch.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.720
I swear, you try
to raise them right.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.991
Welcome to
"space werewolves"!

00:58.993 --> 01:02.327
( laughs )

01:02.329 --> 01:04.229
I'm whitney gurra,
the producer,

01:04.231 --> 01:07.232
And we are thrilled
to be here in wisconsin.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.401
And now let's meet
our director

01:09.403 --> 01:11.336
Vic defazerelli!

01:13.907 --> 01:16.942
The studio wanted
a young, hip director,

01:16.944 --> 01:18.944
But instead
y went for handsome.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.846
( laughs )

01:20.848 --> 01:25.284
But enough about me
and my three oscars,

01:25.286 --> 01:28.520
You're here to see our star

01:28.522 --> 01:31.557
- Liv rooney.
- Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

01:31.559 --> 01:33.792
Here's your exclusive
first look

01:33.794 --> 01:35.894
At tristan lycanth.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.229
<i>- ( whooshing )</i>
<i>- ( cheering )</i>

01:40.733 --> 01:42.768
You mess with the wolf,

01:42.770 --> 01:45.771
You get the howl.
( howling )

01:48.341 --> 01:49.541
( cheers )

01:49.543 --> 01:50.943
Ahh, I feel invincible.

01:50.945 --> 01:53.579
There is literally nothing
I can't do in this suit.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.014
Except...
Use the bathroom.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.353
Do you really
expect us to believe

02:01.355 --> 02:03.622
Intergalactic hero
tristan lycanth

02:03.624 --> 02:06.458
Can be brought to life
by a bubbly teenybopper

02:06.460 --> 02:08.494
From
♪ "sing it loud!"

02:08.496 --> 02:13.031
When you see liv in action,
you will be a believer
like we are.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.835
In action?
Are you saying she's going
to do her own stunts?

02:16.837 --> 02:19.805
Don't be crazy.
No movie star does that.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.641
Except for me!
Yep.

02:22.643 --> 02:26.879
Rooney is going to do
all her own stunts
in this movie.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.981
What did I just say?

02:28.983 --> 02:32.017
All my own stunts?
The most dangerous thing

02:32.019 --> 02:34.653
That I had to do
on ♪ "sing it loud!"

02:34.655 --> 02:36.321
Was sing loud!

02:36.323 --> 02:38.657

03:30.710 --> 03:33.078
All right, willow,
tonight we hit
the big time.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.480
The semi-finals
of the state championship!

03:35.482 --> 03:38.083
- Go, porcupines!
- Bam!  What?

03:39.619 --> 03:42.721
All right, girls, I want you
to look deep inside yourselves

03:42.723 --> 03:44.656
- And ask this question...
- Okay.

03:44.658 --> 03:48.160
Does anybody need to use
the bathroom before we
get on that bus?

03:50.096 --> 03:52.030
Dad, how about you
coach the game

03:52.032 --> 03:53.999
And I will coach
my bladder.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.134
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

03:57.704 --> 03:59.705
Hey, maddie, I thought
I would ride the team bus

03:59.707 --> 04:01.907
With you to the game.
Go porcupines!

04:01.909 --> 04:03.141
Nope!

04:04.444 --> 04:06.044
I'll just
meet you there!

04:06.046 --> 04:09.114
Okay, I got my rally finger
and my tushy cushion.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.483
Oh, I forgot
my porcu-pom-poms.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.052
Uh, mom, we really
need to go, so.

04:14.054 --> 04:17.089
Well, okay, but if there's
a noticeable lack
of school spirit,

04:17.091 --> 04:18.857
Do not point
the foam finger at me.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.726
Maddie, wait!

04:20.728 --> 04:23.929
Oh, I forgot to wish you
good luck at your game.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.931
Go-o-o-d luck!

04:25.933 --> 04:28.166
Thanks, liv.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.836
Wait!
I'm sorry I can't
it to your game,

04:30.838 --> 04:34.706
But I'm filming the movie
and I just wanted to tell you
how proud I am of you.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.074
Oh, thank you.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.042
Gotta go, see you.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.977
I mean, with--
with-- with--

04:38.979 --> 04:42.080
The state championship
and then the junior olympics,

04:42.082 --> 04:44.049
You are just unstoppable.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.018
And yet you keep
stopping me.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.888
- What's wrong?
- Okay, so I'm totally
wigged out

04:49.890 --> 04:51.657
Because I told the world
I would do all my own stunts.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.458
- Now you're not sure
you can handle it.
- Right!

04:53.460 --> 04:55.594
And if I chicken out,
everyone's gonna think
I'm a total fraud.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.029
And you might never get
another role like this.

04:57.031 --> 04:58.096
- Oh, you know me so--
- well.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.998
( sighs )

05:00.000 --> 05:02.668
- What do I do?
- Okay, first, liv,

05:02.670 --> 05:04.703
- Breathe.
- Okay.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.705
Both:
Ahhh.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.242
( shrieks )
it's not working!

05:10.244 --> 05:13.078
Liv, when you get scared,
just remember,

05:13.080 --> 05:15.147
Fear is just another reason
to try harder.

05:15.149 --> 05:18.684
- ( exhales )
- and you are going to be
an amazing space werewolf.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.619
( sighs )
thank you.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.487
You always
know what to say.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.122
Now go get 'em, mads!

05:24.124 --> 05:25.991
Yay sports!

05:25.993 --> 05:28.660
You too.
Yay...

05:28.662 --> 05:30.529
Pretending!

05:30.531 --> 05:31.730
Gotta go.

05:36.035 --> 05:38.870
All right, liv.
I guess you're a little nervous

05:38.872 --> 05:40.939
Because you had
to open your big yap

05:40.941 --> 05:44.209
And say,
"I'll do my own stunts!
I'll do my own stunts!"

05:45.712 --> 05:48.513
But you're not gonna have
to do anything tough,

05:48.515 --> 05:50.849
Except put up
with this guy.
( laughs )

05:50.851 --> 05:54.019
Just kidding, mr. D!
I love my job.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.588
Oh well...

05:56.590 --> 05:58.657
I'm not nervous.
( fake giggle )

06:01.060 --> 06:03.328
That is my confident laugh.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.699
Great.
So when we shoot
this scene tomorrow,

06:07.701 --> 06:11.536
You will hop out
crashed spaceship
over there,

06:11.538 --> 06:13.572
Run across
the alien landscape

06:13.574 --> 06:17.109
And use the pipe
as a bridge over the chasm.

06:17.111 --> 06:19.077
Um, I don't see a chasm.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.681
This green will
look like a chasm!

06:23.916 --> 06:25.650
When we do
the special effects.

06:25.652 --> 06:28.620
And you never have
to leave the ground.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.623
Bada-bing, bada-boom,
bob's your uncle.

06:32.825 --> 06:34.960
Cut!

06:35.928 --> 06:37.929
Um... Uh, vic,

06:37.931 --> 06:39.598
These are my brothers.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.100
They're really really really big
fans of the graphic novel,

06:42.102 --> 06:45.170
So I just told them
that they could watch
a little bit of filming

06:45.172 --> 06:47.139
If they promised
to be quiet!

06:48.608 --> 06:51.109
Well, it's nice
to have fans on the set.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.612
So what do you think
of the scene, boys?

06:53.614 --> 06:57.048
Think you're ruining
the greatest story
ever told!

06:58.985 --> 07:01.920
This is the most
action-packed moment

07:01.922 --> 07:04.589
In the graphic novel
and you're gonna have her

07:04.591 --> 07:07.592
Skip over a puddle
and pose for pictures?!

07:07.594 --> 07:10.061
This is an abomination!

07:11.264 --> 07:12.998
I have no idea
what that word means,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.600
But if it means...
( blows raspberry )

07:15.602 --> 07:17.068
...Then I concur!

07:18.805 --> 07:20.906
So tell me,
what am I doing wrong?

07:20.908 --> 07:22.941
First of all, I'm not
a fan of that shirt.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.009
( gasps )

07:25.912 --> 07:27.746
And ho ho!

07:27.748 --> 07:32.050
We need explosions.
We need death-defying stunts.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.952
Oh-- ( stammers )

07:33.954 --> 07:35.887
Death--
death-defying?
( fake giggle )

07:35.889 --> 07:38.123
Tristan gets
out of her ship,

07:38.125 --> 07:40.892
Photon blasts blow up
all over the place.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.294
( mimics explosions )

07:42.296 --> 07:46.097
No no, that's not
the way photons sound.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.234
Whitney, be a photon.

07:50.703 --> 07:54.072
( high-pitched )
pew pew pew pew.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.275
And she climbs to the top
of the nuclear transponder

07:57.277 --> 07:58.743
And jumps!

08:01.214 --> 08:04.716
I'm standing, but I'm
on the edge of my seat.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.786
What happens next?
Tell me, tell me!

08:07.788 --> 08:09.387
She makes the jump.

08:09.389 --> 08:12.090
Grabs the glowing
green eye of cantarus,

08:12.092 --> 08:15.193
- But gets blasted
through the temple wall.
- ( mimics explosion )

08:15.195 --> 08:17.229
She emerges
from the rubble,

08:17.231 --> 08:19.397
Having saved the planet

08:19.399 --> 08:20.866
And howls.

08:20.868 --> 08:24.002
Bada-bing, bada-boom,
bob's still your uncle.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.673
I love it!
We've gotta
shoot that scene.

08:28.675 --> 08:32.244
Yeah, but-- well,
if you're scared, we can
get a stunt person.

08:32.246 --> 08:34.079
It's your call.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.218
Um...

08:40.220 --> 08:43.154
( hesitantly )
liv rooney is...

08:43.156 --> 08:44.823
- In!
- ( laughs )

08:46.092 --> 08:48.393
...In way over her head.
( sobs )

08:52.131 --> 08:54.799
I don't know which was
a bigger mistake:

08:54.801 --> 08:57.969
Saying I would do my own stunts
or inviting you to my set.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.872
Well, I find it helps
to make a list.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.246
- Maddie, are you okay?
- She hurt her knee pretty bad.

09:09.148 --> 09:12.083
I'm her father.
I'm carrying her in.

09:13.152 --> 09:15.320
- I got you, number five!
- Whoa whoa whoa.

09:15.322 --> 09:18.189
We're gonna take
good care of you.

09:19.825 --> 09:22.327
Would someone please
tell me what happened
to maddie's knee?

09:22.329 --> 09:24.863
It buckled when I hit
the game-winning shot.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.498
Oooh, buckled.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.501
That is only good on belts
and pilgrim hats.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.737
She can't play
in the championship.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.974
Well, what about
the junior olympics?

09:35.976 --> 09:37.943
It's all gone.
( sniffs )

09:37.945 --> 09:41.279
Ean, I tore my a.C.L.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm gonna
need surgery.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.349
She's not gonna be playing
basketball for quite a while.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.352
This is all my fault.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.287
If I hadn't stolen the ball
and passed it to maddie

09:49.289 --> 09:51.423
To make the shot,
this never would have happened.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.159
Curse my lightning-quick
reflexes!

09:55.027 --> 09:56.861
Willow, don't beat
yourself up.

09:56.863 --> 09:59.130
Joey, this is no time
for romance.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.032
I don't deserve it.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.002
Okay, just for a minute.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.246
- How'd the surgery go?
- It went really well.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.116
What did you do to my house?

10:18.118 --> 10:21.152
We made it so maddie can get
up the stairs in her wheelchair.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.254
She's on crutches.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.524
Oh.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.793
Well, now she has something
to look forward to

10:28.795 --> 10:31.129
When she's better.
Whee!

10:33.566 --> 10:36.167
There she is.

10:36.169 --> 10:40.338
( loudly )
maddie, it's willow.

10:40.340 --> 10:44.509
You're gonna get
through this.

10:44.511 --> 10:48.013
( shouting )
willow, I had knee surgery.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.814
Stop shouting!

10:52.018 --> 10:53.585
I'm a jock.
( chuckles )

10:53.587 --> 10:56.221
And I thought
I was invincible.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.189
And I guess I'm not.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.126
And that's scary.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.328
- ( whimpering )
- oh, honey.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.330
Why couldn't it
be me or you?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.399
Or joey?
Wait, not joey.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.234
You?!

11:14.840 --> 11:16.307
Ha!  Hello.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.576
Is this, uh--
is this all necessary?

11:18.578 --> 11:21.913
Depends.
Can you fly?

11:26.519 --> 11:30.055
So, liv, we had vic add
one thing to the stunt scene.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.990
When you're on the top
of the tower,

11:31.992 --> 11:34.225
's gonna collapse.
Watch.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.364
- Parker: Oh!
- Ha ha, whoo!

11:39.366 --> 11:41.499
Oh, vic, show her
the explosions.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.101
Explosions?!

11:43.103 --> 11:46.337
Yeah, explosions--
boom boom boom.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.039
( booms )

11:48.041 --> 11:50.241
Okay, no.
I need a stunt person.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.411
Oh, but you told the world
you'd do all your own stunts.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.281
I'm not just some puppet
that you can make dance.

12:01.187 --> 12:02.420
Ahem.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.490
I stand by
my previous statement.

12:15.201 --> 12:16.468
Ow!

12:16.470 --> 12:18.203
( sighs )

12:18.205 --> 12:20.004
I didn't think my recovery

12:20.006 --> 12:21.606
Would be so hard.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.209
I mean, when my favorite
athletes get injured,

12:24.211 --> 12:25.610
They go away for three months,

12:25.612 --> 12:28.079
They do a shoe commercial
with some inspiring music,

12:28.081 --> 12:30.115
And they come back
good as new.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.950
( sighs )

12:31.952 --> 12:35.086
Have you ever had a week
where you just feel like

12:35.088 --> 12:36.955
Your whole world is ending?

12:36.957 --> 12:38.523
Seriously?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.391
( velcro rips )

12:41.927 --> 12:44.629
Oh my gosh, ha ha.
That was so insensitive of me.

12:44.631 --> 12:48.032
You can hardly stand
and I'm over here making
this all about me.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.634
( giggles )

12:49.636 --> 12:51.503
Would it make you feel better
about your injury

12:51.505 --> 12:53.204
If you heard about
my horrible day?

12:54.440 --> 12:56.141
( snorts )
go for it.

12:56.143 --> 13:00.178
Okay, but only because
this is gonna make you
feel better.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.014
So!
Maddie...

13:03.016 --> 13:06.017
The new stunts that
they have me doing are so scary

13:06.019 --> 13:09.521
And I told them to get
a stunt person because there is
no way that I can pull it off.

13:09.523 --> 13:12.123
- Good call.
- What?!

13:12.125 --> 13:14.659
This is where you give me
a pep talk, yeah?

13:14.661 --> 13:16.427
I mean you're the--
you're the fighter,

13:16.429 --> 13:18.062
You're the winner,
so come on!

13:18.064 --> 13:21.099
Pep talk me.
Change my life.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.301
Go.
And...

13:23.303 --> 13:24.369
Now!

13:25.471 --> 13:27.038
Liv--
( laughs )

13:27.040 --> 13:29.174
I don't feel
like a fighter.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.176
I mean, I definitely
don't feel like a winner.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.710
( laughs )

13:32.712 --> 13:36.147
Ty sure I'm not even
a basketball player
anymore, so.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.117
Wow.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.219
Worst pep talk ever.

13:42.521 --> 13:44.522
She was supposed to say
something like,

13:44.524 --> 13:47.192
"fear is just
a reason to try harder."
( snorting laugh )

13:48.694 --> 13:50.695
I guess she was the one
who needed a pep talk.

13:50.697 --> 13:53.097
That would require major
role reversal,

13:53.099 --> 13:55.166
But actress!

13:55.168 --> 13:57.235
Okay, maddie,

13:57.237 --> 13:59.337
This is
the fear talking, yeah?

13:59.339 --> 14:02.106
<i>I mean, you're giving up</i>
<i>before you even try</i>

14:02.108 --> 14:04.008
And we--

14:04.010 --> 14:05.243
We don't do that.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.579
Oh, we don't?

14:07.581 --> 14:09.614
Okay, um, did you try?

14:09.616 --> 14:12.217
Or did you just, you know,
call your stunt double?

14:13.319 --> 14:15.019
We're both afraid.

14:15.754 --> 14:17.589
She was right.

14:17.591 --> 14:20.391
I realized the only way
to help maddie face her fear

14:20.393 --> 14:23.328
Was to overcome
my own fears first.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.734
Shhh.

14:37.409 --> 14:39.377
( mimicking laser blasts )

14:40.412 --> 14:43.314
Pew pew
pew pew pew!

14:44.450 --> 14:46.251
So awesome!

14:46.253 --> 14:49.120
Sixth grade is gonna be
such a let-down after this.

14:49.122 --> 14:52.323
Okay, I win.
All my darts were poisoned.

14:54.126 --> 14:57.195
Let's make a movie!
Where's my stunt-tristan?

14:57.197 --> 14:59.297
Oh, mr. Defazerelli,
he's right here.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.402
That's him, huh?

15:05.471 --> 15:08.139
Yeah, he doesn't
look like liv.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.208
You think we could
get a better match?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.277
Oh oh, hang on.
He's not in his
wardrobe yet.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.344
Go ahead.

15:15.781 --> 15:19.183
Ahhh, now I see.

15:19.185 --> 15:22.553
Yeah, we'll add
the suit in later
with special effects.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.088
Wait, I'll do it!

15:24.090 --> 15:25.790
I'll do the stunt.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.762
Great, but, um,
I thought you were scared.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.330
Well, I-- I am.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.666
But I need to remind someone

15:34.668 --> 15:37.235
That fear is just a reason
to try harder.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.638
You heard the woman.
Get outta here!

15:40.640 --> 15:41.873
Fired.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.580
Hey hey,
where's the little guy?

15:49.582 --> 15:51.716
We're about
to shoot the scene.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.619
Well, he decided
he wanted to be in charge
of explosions.

15:56.855 --> 15:59.123
How would you like
to yell "action"?

15:59.125 --> 16:02.627
Oh, sir, I would be honored
to yell action.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.230
Win three oscars.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.865
And...

16:07.867 --> 16:09.300
Action!

16:17.576 --> 16:19.644
<i>( dramatic music playing )</i>

16:21.847 --> 16:24.248

16:30.255 --> 16:31.422

16:32.624 --> 16:34.325
( growls )

16:43.836 --> 16:45.603
( groans )

16:57.816 --> 16:59.817

17:02.488 --> 17:03.855
( growling )

17:37.523 --> 17:39.757
( laughs )

17:51.003 --> 17:53.271
( rapid beeping )

17:55.641 --> 17:56.707
Oooh!

18:10.289 --> 18:11.989
You mess with the wolf,

18:11.991 --> 18:13.991
You get the howl.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.626
( howling )

18:20.032 --> 18:22.266
( cheering )

18:24.269 --> 18:26.771
- Cut!  That was perfect!
-   <i>( bell rings )</i>

18:26.773 --> 18:28.806
( applause, cheering continue )

18:29.775 --> 18:31.309
I did it!

18:31.311 --> 18:32.710
I did all my own stunts.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.279
Great!
Let's do it again

18:35.281 --> 18:37.448
And we'll shoot it
this time.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.357
All right, maddie,
ready to do some physical
therapy exercises?

18:46.359 --> 18:49.060
Ooh, you know what?
I have a better idea.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.429
How about you do them
and I watch?

18:51.431 --> 18:54.031
Maddie, you have got
to get up off that couch.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.934
Your porcu-proud mom
is gonna root for you.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.070
( chanting )
who's gonna do her exercises?

18:59.072 --> 19:00.638
You are, oh, you are.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.540
Yeah, who's gonna do
her exercises?

19:02.542 --> 19:05.543
- You you you.
- Yeah, I don't think
that's helping.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.715
Oh hey, porcupines, how was
the championship game?

19:10.717 --> 19:13.084
Not so bad
we only lost by 38 points.

19:14.052 --> 19:15.920
I kept passing the ball to you

19:15.922 --> 19:17.321
And you weren't there.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.459
You've got to get better.
We need you next season.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.761
( scoffs )
, well, considering

19:23.763 --> 19:26.030
I can hardly stand
long enough to take
a shower,

19:26.032 --> 19:28.699
I wouldn't depend
on me for next season.

19:28.701 --> 19:32.503
Maddie, you cannot give up
on the one thing you love
most in the world.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.339
But I'm afraid I'll never
get back to where I was.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.375
Did somebody say

19:37.377 --> 19:39.010
Afraid?!

19:41.046 --> 19:42.613
Oh-hoo!

19:42.615 --> 19:44.515
Dramatic entrance: Check.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.852
( clears throat )
so, maddie,

19:47.854 --> 19:49.921
I had something that
I was afraid to do too.

19:49.923 --> 19:52.990
But I did it!
( laughs )

19:52.992 --> 19:54.926
Everybody check out
the "space werewolves"

19:54.928 --> 19:56.527
- Movie trailer.
- Oooh.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.530
Did somebody say
"space werewolves"?

19:59.532 --> 20:01.933
Did somebody say
"space werewolves"?

20:07.506 --> 20:09.740
<i>( dramatic music playing )</i>

20:09.742 --> 20:12.143
Liv's voice:
<i>They came to our world</i>
<i>to wipe us out.</i>

20:12.145 --> 20:15.046
<i>There was no one left</i>
<i>to save us but me.</i>

20:17.549 --> 20:19.517
<i>I never wanted to be a hero.</i>

20:19.519 --> 20:20.985
<i>They started this fight</i>

20:20.987 --> 20:23.387
<i>And I'm gonna finish it.</i>

20:55.854 --> 20:57.755

You get the howl.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.663
- ( cheering )
- oh, liv,

21:05.665 --> 21:07.999
That was so awesome.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.969
It's just too beautiful.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.074
I am the mother
of an action hero.

21:18.176 --> 21:19.644
Wha--

21:19.646 --> 21:21.712
You said that you were gonna
get a stunt double.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.215
- That was really you.
- Yeah.

21:24.217 --> 21:27.918
Well, I remembered something
that you told me,

21:27.920 --> 21:31.956
Which is "fear is just
another reason to try harder."

21:31.958 --> 21:35.059
( chuckles )
thanks, liv, that means
a lot to me.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.794
Yeah, whatever.
Get up!

21:36.796 --> 21:38.129
- Yeah, whoo!
- ( cheering )

21:38.131 --> 21:40.064
- Willow: Come on, captain!
- Joey:   <i>Girl!</i>

21:40.066 --> 21:43.067
Come on, maddie,
this could be your biggest
"bam-what" moment ever.

21:43.069 --> 21:46.103
Yeah, bam!
What?!

21:46.105 --> 21:48.706
- Bam!  What?!
- Oooh.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.175
Bam!  What?!
Whoo whoo whoo.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.010
Bam!  What?!
Whoo whoo whoo.

21:53.012 --> 21:56.047
- Bam!  What?!
Whoo whoo whoo.
- Okay okay okay!

21:56.049 --> 21:58.215
Stop stop!

21:58.217 --> 22:01.252
I'm getting up, but only because
you are all so annoying.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.223
- Ready?
- ( mimicking drumroll )

22:06.225 --> 22:08.693
- Let's go, captain.
- You got it, you got it.
Take it easy.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.861

22:13.031 --> 22:15.099
She's up,
whoop whoop whoop,
she's up!

22:15.101 --> 22:16.701
I think, I think,
I think

22:16.703 --> 22:18.202
The moment is over, mom.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.138
Not quite.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.177
Oh, maddie,

22:26.179 --> 22:27.978
You know
I love you so much.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.580
( inhales )

22:29.582 --> 22:32.049
But how long has it been
since you've taken a shower?

22:33.852 --> 22:37.121
She stinks,
whoop whoop whoop,
she stinks!

22:37.123 --> 22:38.823
Whoop whoop whoop,
she stinks!

22:38.825 --> 22:40.758
Whoop whoop whoop,
she stinks!

22:40.760 --> 22:42.193
Whoop whoop whoop,
she stinks!

22:42.195 --> 22:47.164
I cannot believe they left
the doors open to this set.

22:47.166 --> 22:50.534
Hey, I bet you could get
rigged up in that harness

22:50.536 --> 22:52.970
And do the same jump
liv did.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.606
Hook me up.

22:57.909 --> 22:59.143
Make me proud,
big brother.

Whoo, I am

I got ya!

23:11.022 --> 23:13.758
What is happening?

23:14.726 --> 23:16.727
Hey, joey!

23:16.729 --> 23:18.629
Willow!

23:18.631 --> 23:21.866
Parker, you sold me out
for 20 bucks?!

23:21.868 --> 23:24.735
It's really not about the money.
It's more about

23:24.737 --> 23:27.071
What the money can get you.

23:28.306 --> 23:30.207
Have fun.
