At last,
they located a planet with
the necessary orientation

13:01.531 --> 13:04.867
and magnetic field
to harness its
rotational energy.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.130
In the area
now known as Egypt,

13:18.214 --> 13:22.092
my people
constructed a giant,
semi-octahedral antenna

13:22.177 --> 13:24.720
to beam Earth's
rotational energy
to Thuban.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.722
AMY: The Great
Pyramid at Giza!

13:26.806 --> 13:30.225
KATZ: Yes. The Egyptians
viewed us as gods,

13:30.310 --> 13:32.978
but ironically,
that was our downfall.

13:33.521 --> 13:38.150
They pampered us
with feasts most fancy
and victuals most tender.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.336
But the technology
to save our planet was lost.

13:57.420 --> 14:01.590
Lost, that is,
until I heard you speak
at Mars University.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.636
So, you called my thesis
a fat sack of barf,
and then you stole it?

Earth's rotational energy!

Half of you will cook,

14:37.168 --> 14:38.210
Quite.

14:38.294 --> 14:42.172
Even so, you'd still
need a tremendously
powerful static charge

14:42.257 --> 14:43.507
to trigger the process.

I'm not interested.
