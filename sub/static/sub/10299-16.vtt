01:16.501 --> 01:18.667
<i>Do you, Peggy Wanker,</i>

01:18.701 --> 01:22.066
<i>take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband?</i>

01:22.100 --> 01:23.533
<i>I do.</i>

01:23.567 --> 01:27.166
<i>And do you, Mel Gibson,
take Peggy Wanker--</i>

01:27.200 --> 01:28.200
Oh, he does.

01:28.234 --> 01:30.734
He does, he does.

01:37.534 --> 01:39.300
Peg, you'll never guess
what happened

01:39.334 --> 01:40.633
at the shoe store today.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.934
Tongue caught in
the shoe sizer again?

01:43.968 --> 01:45.700
You civilians never realize

01:45.734 --> 01:48.099
what a highly sophisticated
piece of equipment that is.

01:48.133 --> 01:50.099
All right.
Tell me what happened.

01:50.133 --> 01:52.700
Well, you know that new aerobics
center up above me?

01:52.734 --> 01:55.600
The one with the sign,
quarter ton discount?

01:57.267 --> 02:00.734
Well, today they played
Van Halen's "Jump."

02:02.367 --> 02:05.400
And damned if
the whole herd didn't.

02:05.434 --> 02:06.400
It was awful, Peg.

02:06.434 --> 02:07.567
The ceiling opened up,

02:07.601 --> 02:10.433
down they came,
blocking out the sun.

02:10.467 --> 02:13.234
I experienced cellulite winter.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.600
God, the "humongity."

02:15.634 --> 02:17.500
Peg, I could have been killed.

02:17.534 --> 02:18.500
Well,

02:18.534 --> 02:19.966
I think you got
what you deserved,

02:20.000 --> 02:21.667
going by there
every morning,

02:21.701 --> 02:24.733
yelling "is that
a Milky Way on the floor?"

02:24.767 --> 02:25.767
Hey, hey, hey.

02:25.801 --> 02:26.767
I was helping.

02:26.801 --> 02:27.999
They lost a lot more weight

02:28.033 --> 02:30.200
wrestling with each other
for that imaginary candy

02:30.234 --> 02:31.433
than they did twisting

02:31.467 --> 02:33.834
to Hammer's
"Please Don't Hurt Me."

02:33.868 --> 02:36.700
But, now, on to
the sadder side of the news.

02:36.734 --> 02:38.266
The shoe store
decided to lay me off

02:38.300 --> 02:39.600
while they fix the ceiling.

02:39.634 --> 02:40.800
And as an added bonus,

02:40.834 --> 02:42.266
as long as
the store is closed,

02:42.300 --> 02:43.767
I don't get paid.

02:43.801 --> 02:46.066
Oh, my God.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.167
Can the economy stand
the hit?

02:50.367 --> 02:52.267
Do you think that you can?

02:54.167 --> 02:55.300
Anyway, don't worry.

02:55.334 --> 02:56.867
I told 'em that
I might not be there

02:56.901 --> 02:58.066
when they call me back.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.133
And what did they say?

03:00.167 --> 03:01.834
They said that they'd--

03:01.868 --> 03:04.900
They'd take that gamble.

03:06.467 --> 03:07.700
Oh, hi, kids.

03:07.734 --> 03:09.966
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.500
I'm afraid the wacky,
luxurious lifestyle

03:12.534 --> 03:15.099
we've become accustomed to
is no longer.

03:15.133 --> 03:18.733
The Bundys of Bel Air
are no more.

03:18.767 --> 03:21.467
Yes, Daddy's been laid off.

03:21.501 --> 03:24.734
Well, we won't lose Tara,
will we?

03:29.834 --> 03:31.066
Oh, Al.

03:31.100 --> 03:34.266
Surely you can see the humor
in a man who makes no money

03:34.300 --> 03:37.133
saying he lost his job.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.333
Yeah, I mean,
come on, Dad.

03:38.367 --> 03:41.533
That's like Kelly saying
she lost her mind.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.500
I don't get it.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.834
Well, at least this time
it's not just us.

03:51.868 --> 03:53.999
Everybody's feeling the pinch
of this recession.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.800
Money's tight all over.

03:55.834 --> 03:58.533
Come see
our matching BMWs.

03:58.567 --> 03:59.700
Well,

03:59.734 --> 04:01.266
they're not exactly matching.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.033
My license plate
says "Love her."

04:03.067 --> 04:06.099
And mine says "Love him."

04:06.133 --> 04:07.834
Al, why don't you get
a license plate

04:07.868 --> 04:09.633
that tells the world
how you feel?

04:09.667 --> 04:14.034
Because "kill me"
was taken by your father.

04:15.734 --> 04:17.099
Uh, excuse me,

04:17.132 --> 04:19.300
but if only to if only
to rub this in my father's face,

04:19.334 --> 04:20.999
can you tell us
how you can afford

04:21.033 --> 04:22.500
two major cars
like those?

04:22.534 --> 04:25.767
Well, as anyone with a little
bit of business savvy knows,

04:25.801 --> 04:28.667
these are the times
that make millionaires.

04:29.167 --> 04:31.134
And paupers.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.900
Anyway, I-- I can't
go into details,

04:33.934 --> 04:36.567
but through a little inside tip
in the stock market,

04:36.601 --> 04:39.033
I'd say I made
a penny or two.

04:39.067 --> 04:43.300
You made $60,000,
you little honey puddle.

04:43.334 --> 04:44.999
I did not.
Did too.

04:45.033 --> 04:46.567
Did not.
Did too.

04:46.601 --> 04:48.333
All right.

04:48.367 --> 04:50.368
I did.

04:50.868 --> 04:51.834
Oh, yeah?

04:51.868 --> 04:54.400
Well, my Al here
made a penny or two.

04:54.434 --> 04:56.934
Literally.

04:56.968 --> 04:58.800
Of course, his is coming
from unemployment

04:58.834 --> 05:00.900
because he's lost his job.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.166
So do you think you could
loan us a couple of bucks?

05:03.200 --> 05:05.733
You know, just enough
to keep that Mary Kay lady

05:05.767 --> 05:08.767
from breaking my kneecaps.

05:09.367 --> 05:10.867
I can do better
than that.

05:10.901 --> 05:12.567
For as a wise man
once said,

05:12.601 --> 05:15.166
if you want a man to eat,
you don't hand him a fish.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.266
You teach him
to be a fisherman.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.767
So, what do you say, Al?

05:18.801 --> 05:20.166
You wanna come down
to my club

05:20.200 --> 05:22.567
and bus tables
on fish night?

05:22.601 --> 05:24.533
It doesn't pay much,
but no one will be looking

05:24.567 --> 05:25.999
if you want to take
a little butter

05:26.033 --> 05:27.333
back to the wife
and kids.

05:27.367 --> 05:30.066
Daddy, please, please?
Please, please, Dad.

05:30.100 --> 05:33.700
Get away from me,
you pride-less vermin!

05:33.734 --> 05:36.500
I was not born
to be a bus boy.

05:36.534 --> 05:39.800
I'm a shoe man,
born and bred, damn it.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.200
And there's not a shoe store
in this town

05:43.234 --> 05:45.266
that wouldn't pay
a dollar and a quarter an hour

05:45.300 --> 05:47.133
to have the best.

05:47.167 --> 05:48.366
You hear my words.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.999
I will not let
my family starve.

05:51.033 --> 05:53.200
I will not.

05:53.234 --> 05:55.734
We're already starving.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.033
Listen, Dad.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.567
There's something
at the school

05:59.601 --> 06:01.166
that you just might
be qualified for.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.633
What? Principal?

06:02.667 --> 06:05.201
Vice principal?
Dean of boys?

06:32.167 --> 06:34.934
Well, security guard's
not too bad.

06:34.968 --> 06:37.333
Got a cool uniform.

06:37.367 --> 06:40.867
A sense of independence,
little stick.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.934
Let all wrongdoers beware.

06:43.968 --> 06:47.800
Those who would perpetrate evil,
must answer to me.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.567
Al Bundy,

06:49.601 --> 06:52.101
security dude.

06:57.434 --> 06:58.567
Oh, God,

06:58.601 --> 07:01.600
this can't be happening
to me!

07:03.701 --> 07:06.200
Can this be true?

07:06.234 --> 07:09.734
Am I not a man
I laughed at as a child?

07:20.400 --> 07:22.033
Hi, Dad.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.034
Oh. Hi, son.

07:24.734 --> 07:26.500
It's not the way it looks.
I was just, uh,

07:26.534 --> 07:29.267
crying on the floor.

07:30.501 --> 07:32.533
Yeah, Dad, I know.

07:32.567 --> 07:34.900
Thought we were going
to a club.

07:34.934 --> 07:36.834
And remember our deal.

07:36.868 --> 07:39.133
We go, you pay.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.500
If I don't find anybody cool,

07:40.534 --> 07:44.034
I'll come sit next
to you for a while.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.401
Dad, this girl
really likes me.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.034
Can I have some money?

07:51.901 --> 07:53.467
Son, I know you see
the uniform,

07:53.501 --> 07:55.333
and you think, uh,
another millionaire

07:55.367 --> 07:57.099
working school security
for kicks.

07:57.133 --> 07:58.600
But, uh,

07:58.634 --> 08:00.999
once I wore
a different uniform.

08:01.033 --> 08:03.133
A prouder uniform.

08:03.167 --> 08:05.433
Once, I roamed
these halls like a king.

08:05.467 --> 08:06.834
Dad, please.

08:06.868 --> 08:09.333
Look at that trophy
over there, son.

08:09.367 --> 08:12.166
Polk High,
city championship, 1966.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.400
I won that baby.

08:14.434 --> 08:16.700
I still remember the day.

08:16.734 --> 08:18.166
Not the story.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.533
It was the last game
of the year.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.567
Polk High versus
Andrew Johnson High.

08:24.601 --> 08:27.334
Two great teams
of equal strength.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.468
Dad, she's not wearing
a bra.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.133
Finally, we met on
the field of battle.

08:35.167 --> 08:37.033
Came down
to two great players.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.732
Yours truly,

08:38.767 --> 08:43.500
and a guy from Andrew Johnson
High they called "Spare Tire."

08:43.701 --> 08:45.033
Why, because he was fat?

08:45.067 --> 08:48.900
No. Because he wore one
with a chain around his neck.

08:48.934 --> 08:50.133
Anyhow,

08:50.167 --> 08:53.033
finally, it came down
to the final seconds.

08:53.067 --> 08:54.733
Scoreless game.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.567
We had the ball
on the 6-yard line.

08:57.601 --> 09:00.233
They said, "Give
the ball to Bundy."

09:00.267 --> 09:02.133
Everyone knew
I was getting it.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.533
Hut one!

09:03.567 --> 09:05.533
Hut two!

09:05.567 --> 09:08.200
I got the ball, and I went
through that line

09:08.234 --> 09:11.767
like Grandma through
a herd of cattle.

09:12.767 --> 09:15.033
I was going
for a sure six--

09:15.067 --> 09:17.400
when all of a sudden,
on the 1-yard line,

09:17.434 --> 09:21.066
loomed Spare Tire,
waiting for me.

09:21.100 --> 09:24.301
We collided like
two bull elephants.

09:24.801 --> 09:26.667
When it was over,

09:26.701 --> 09:29.967
they were shouting only
one elephant's name.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.134
Al Bundy.

09:33.534 --> 09:36.034
I scored, son.

09:41.667 --> 09:44.167
The winning touchdown!

09:44.434 --> 09:46.001
Son...

09:46.367 --> 09:47.500
that's the story

09:47.534 --> 09:51.368
of the greatest sport moment
in all of history.

09:52.167 --> 09:53.333
You know, Dad,

09:53.367 --> 09:55.400
some say your knee was down
before you crossed--

09:55.434 --> 09:57.533
My knee was not down!

09:57.567 --> 10:00.633
That's a dirty,
stinking lie!

10:00.667 --> 10:02.533
The victory was ours.

10:03.234 --> 10:05.800
For the school,
the championship.

10:05.834 --> 10:07.700
For me?

10:07.734 --> 10:09.633
All-city.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.001
And the legend.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.800
And your mother.

10:16.334 --> 10:18.334
The end.

10:19.067 --> 10:20.567
Oh, God!

10:24.834 --> 10:26.900
You know, when my dad
got like that,

10:26.934 --> 10:29.434
we shot him.

10:30.567 --> 10:31.999
You thought
he was my father?

10:32.033 --> 10:34.500
Heck, no,
Dad's his name.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.900
You know, like, uh,
Pops the janitor?

10:36.934 --> 10:39.434
Dad the security guard?

10:40.767 --> 10:43.667
I'm telling you,
h- he's not my father.

10:43.701 --> 10:47.533
Does the term "sympathy feel"
mean anything to you?

10:54.467 --> 10:56.867
Oh, what the hell.

10:58.167 --> 11:00.334
All is well.

11:02.534 --> 11:05.400
Oh, I guess it's time
for a little...

11:05.434 --> 11:07.201
security-guard break.

11:30.534 --> 11:32.200
* I'm a travelin' man *

11:32.234 --> 11:35.300
* Made a lot of stops *

11:35.334 --> 11:37.099
* All over the world *

11:37.133 --> 11:41.767
* And in every port, I *

11:41.801 --> 11:45.001
* Meet one lovely girl *

11:50.234 --> 11:53.034
Yeah, this john ain't so bad.

11:57.667 --> 12:02.266
<i>* All but one man died *</i>

12:02.300 --> 12:06.900
<i>* There at Bitter Creek *</i>

12:06.934 --> 12:12.200
<i>* And they say he ran away *</i>

12:12.234 --> 12:13.200
<i>* Branded! *</i>

12:13.234 --> 12:16.900
<i>* Scorned is the one who ran *</i>

12:16.934 --> 12:18.934
<i>* What do you do
when you're branded *</i>

12:18.968 --> 12:22.167
<i>* And you know you're a man? *</i>

12:23.234 --> 12:25.600
<i>* Wherever you go *</i>

12:25.634 --> 12:27.533
<i>* For the rest of your life *</i>

12:27.567 --> 12:31.600
<i>* You must prove *</i>

12:31.634 --> 12:35.134
<i>* You're a man *</i>

13:31.834 --> 13:33.333
Gee, honey.

13:33.367 --> 13:35.834
Think you might change
your shirt today?

13:35.868 --> 13:37.867
Why bother?

13:38.834 --> 13:40.867
What can I do
when I'm branded,

13:40.901 --> 13:43.900
and I know I'm a man?

13:45.834 --> 13:48.099
I must find my bowl.

13:48.133 --> 13:50.133
Oh, honey, you do
the best you can.

13:50.167 --> 13:51.633
It's just that
it's dark at night,

13:51.667 --> 13:52.834
and you get groggy, and--

13:52.868 --> 13:53.867
Not that bowl,

13:53.901 --> 13:57.401
you whinnying
ninny of a woman.

13:58.767 --> 14:00.800
My championship bowl.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.867
If only I had a clue.

14:04.133 --> 14:07.134
Get that, will you, Peg?

14:12.934 --> 14:14.200
Gee, Al.

14:14.234 --> 14:16.334
It's a note.

14:17.067 --> 14:18.500
"If you want the trophy,

14:18.534 --> 14:20.934
"come to Johnson High
at 8 tonight.

14:20.968 --> 14:24.266
"Alone, or the trophy dies.

14:24.300 --> 14:27.301
P.S. You stink."

14:28.567 --> 14:31.600
Gee, honey, this must be
someone who knows you.

14:33.868 --> 14:35.834
Peg, this sounds like
the clue I'm looking for.

14:35.868 --> 14:38.468
This man sounds
like he knows something.

14:39.334 --> 14:42.334
I'm going after him, Peg.

14:43.067 --> 14:46.201
I might not be coming back.

14:46.701 --> 14:47.900
Oh, honey,

14:47.934 --> 14:49.767
please come back.

14:49.801 --> 14:52.333
You're worried about me,
aren't you, babe?

14:52.367 --> 14:55.567
'Course, I'm worried.

14:55.601 --> 14:56.966
Tomorrow's garbage day.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.468
I'm not getting up early
to lug it out.

15:13.467 --> 15:15.034
You.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.667
Spare Tire Dixon.

15:38.534 --> 15:41.233
Why'd you do it?

15:41.267 --> 15:44.401
Why'd you steal my trophy?

15:45.767 --> 15:48.333
I took it
because it belongs to me.

15:48.367 --> 15:50.567
That was
our championship.

15:50.601 --> 15:53.600
You never made it past
that goal line.

15:53.634 --> 15:57.633
I dropped you
like third-period French.

15:58.501 --> 15:59.800
Your knee was down.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.200
Was not!
Was too!

16:01.234 --> 16:02.200
Was not!
Was too!

16:02.234 --> 16:03.200
Not!
Too!

16:03.234 --> 16:04.734
Not!
Too!

16:05.467 --> 16:08.468
Wait a second,
what were we talking about?

16:08.734 --> 16:10.066
Um...

16:10.100 --> 16:12.533
Let's see,
I didn't get no dinner.

16:12.567 --> 16:14.500
Took the bus.
And I had come
through the door.

16:14.534 --> 16:16.867
Damn kids took
the car.
Ran out of gas.

16:16.901 --> 16:18.567
Oh, yeah.

16:18.601 --> 16:20.066
Trophy!

16:20.100 --> 16:22.733
The trophy you
cheated me out of.

16:22.767 --> 16:24.834
Should've been mine,
Bundy.

16:24.868 --> 16:26.867
Headline should've read,

16:26.901 --> 16:32.334
"Spare Tire crushes unidentified
white man at goal line."

16:33.767 --> 16:35.600
I was supposed to play
college ball.

16:35.634 --> 16:37.266
But it never happened.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.834
You know why?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.368
You're too stupid?

16:42.234 --> 16:43.834
No.

16:43.868 --> 16:45.500
It was because
after that game,

16:45.534 --> 16:47.900
I fell into
a deep depression.

16:47.934 --> 16:50.366
And I turned where
too many kids before me

16:50.400 --> 16:52.500
turned to drown
their sorrows...

16:52.534 --> 16:54.034
pie.

16:55.834 --> 16:57.033
Come tryouts,

16:57.067 --> 16:59.400
I could no longer get
in a three-point stance

16:59.434 --> 17:02.867
unless there was
a pie on the floor.

17:02.901 --> 17:05.098
My career was over.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.633
You stole the glory
that should have been mine.

17:07.666 --> 17:09.867
I had a little bit of glory,
yeah, but you had pie.

17:09.901 --> 17:12.900
And I haven't eaten
in 19 years.

17:13.968 --> 17:17.400
I'd give you that trophy
right now for a piece of pie.

17:17.434 --> 17:21.633
So pardon me if I don't
cry for you, Argentina.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.767
<i>But I sell women's shoes,
and I'm married.</i>

17:24.800 --> 17:25.900
Oh, yeah?

17:25.934 --> 17:27.599
Well, I'll bet
your mother-in-law

17:27.634 --> 17:29.334
doesn't look like this.

17:36.834 --> 17:39.333
No. My mother-in-law
looks like this.

17:39.367 --> 17:41.867
Okay, okay.

17:43.133 --> 17:45.467
Let's talk quality
of life.

17:45.501 --> 17:48.700
Let's talk my best pair
of socks.

17:50.767 --> 17:53.433
Nice try, Spare Tire.

17:53.467 --> 17:55.999
But get a gander
at my best socks.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.034
Whoa!

18:03.801 --> 18:04.767
Now...

18:04.801 --> 18:07.433
step aside.

18:07.467 --> 18:09.966
'Cause I'm taking that trophy
back where it belongs.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.133
To Polk High.

18:11.167 --> 18:14.033
And not for me,
but for the children.

18:14.067 --> 18:15.600
So they can look
at that trophy

18:15.634 --> 18:19.401
and know that they too
can peak at 17.

18:20.601 --> 18:22.434
Gimme my trophy.

18:23.634 --> 18:25.467
You want that trophy?

18:25.501 --> 18:28.500
Well, here's how
you can get it.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.934
There's the line, Bundy.

18:32.968 --> 18:35.633
The only way
you're taking this trophy

18:35.667 --> 18:38.700
is by getting past me.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.133
Come on, Bundy.

18:52.167 --> 18:54.334
On the count of three.

18:57.234 --> 18:59.434
Three.

19:09.167 --> 19:11.434
Let's rock.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.500
Nice run, Bundy.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.133
Nice-- Nice hit,
Spare Tire.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.934
We were two pretty good athletes
back then, weren't we?

21:40.968 --> 21:44.134
Hey, we're still
great athletes!

21:44.901 --> 21:47.900
I'm hurt real bad,
you know.

21:49.467 --> 21:51.468
Me too.

21:51.868 --> 21:53.400
I can't get up.

21:53.434 --> 21:55.434
Me neither.

21:57.267 --> 21:59.267
Sleepy time now?

22:00.868 --> 22:02.667
Oh, yes.
