We are not together, all right?
And it is not a regular thing.

dream husband and two perfect babies.

02:39.117 --> 02:43.037

after I told you what was going on.

02:43.121 --> 02:46.666
How I was missing him.
And I was questioning everything!

02:46.749 --> 02:48.626

Not him, not really.

Everyone wonders "what if," all the time.
I didn't think it was real.

That you were seriously considering
leaving your husband?

Holy shit.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.973
What was his response?

03:45.183 --> 03:49.229
He bent me over the kitchen counter
and fucked me probably better

and it was just kind of weird and violent.

04:04.369 --> 04:08.081
And he didn't even say a word to me
before he left for work this morning.

from Morgan Stanley...

in the mirror for the next three years.

10:33.841 --> 10:38.638
Well, because I just, I can't picture you
as like this tiara-wearing debutante,

10:40.431 --> 10:42.266
Well, that's because I wasn't, okay?

10:42.350 --> 10:45.519
Tiaras are for princesses.
I was homecoming queen.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.229
I wore a crown.

10:47.313 --> 10:51.525

of cheerleading legend in Cobb County.

-Gonna make you show me one of these days.

You had it made.

-Must have been hard to leave.
-Not as hard as people think.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.747
I mean, I did have a hope chest.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.291
But it was filled with a lot more
than just embroidery

11:07.375 --> 11:11.545
and pictures of wedding dresses clipped
out of Modern Bride and Vogue.

11:11.629 --> 11:17.134
I mean, I had plenty of those too,
but I don't know, I just, I wanted more.

11:17.218 --> 11:21.597
That wasn't enough. More than all
the other girls. Ever since I was little.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.432
Big appetite.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.352
I needed a big city to try and fill it.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.146
Doesn't get bigger than New York.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.358

I wanted crazy nights on the town.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.822
How's that working out for you?

I don't know.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.575
[Billie chuckles]

11:43.035 --> 11:45.454
Georgia wasn't enough...

11:47.623 --> 11:49.792
but New York might be a little too much.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.336
I know exactly what you mean.

11:53.003 --> 11:58.175
So I've got a house, um,
out in the country, Connecticut.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.636
Wow, nice.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.513
So I spend weekends out there.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.933
But lately I've been getting this itch,

12:06.016 --> 12:08.978
you know, maybe I need
to move out there full-time.

12:09.854 --> 12:13.524
It's hard to start a family
in the city. So...

I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.

12:17.403 --> 12:21.282
-[woman] Cooper? What are you doing here?
-"Here it comes," I thought.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.826
-Hey! How are you?
-That looks like another shoe

12:23.909 --> 12:25.119
if I ever saw one.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.246
Mm! Em, I want you to meet Billie.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.247
Oh.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.292
-Short for Wilhelmina?
-Yes!

12:32.209 --> 12:33.878
-Except it wasn't.
-You're a lucky girl.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.005
There isn't ever another shoe with Cooper.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.339
-How's your mom?
-Great!

12:37.423 --> 12:39.216
He's a one-shoe kind of guy.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.093
What you see is what you get.

12:41.177 --> 12:44.013
-I know a great physiotherapist.
-You're so sweet. She'd love that.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.725
"That's the kind of girl who gets
to marry a guy like Cooper," I thought.
