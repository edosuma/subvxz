08:34.764 --> 08:37.225
Perry's the only one
who's ever supported me.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.436
Are you sure you're not just
freaking out about the baby

08:39.519 --> 08:41.145
and looking for a dumb excuse to bail?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.647
Like you did with "Close Talker"

08:42.731 --> 08:43.982
or "Man Hands"?

08:44.065 --> 08:45.483
I like a dainty hand, Kimmy.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.235
You like Reuben too, though, right?

08:47.318 --> 08:48.611
[Perry] I mean, if you like this guy,

08:48.695 --> 08:50.321
you should give him a chance, right?

08:50.405 --> 08:51.406
Good point, Perry.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.323
Thanks, man.

08:55.326 --> 08:59.205
I'm gonna see how it goes tonight
with Reuben and...

08:59.289 --> 09:00.331
Linda.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.625
Wait.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.127
Who's Linda? His boss?

09:04.210 --> 09:05.962
[gasps] Linda's the baby.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.630
Yeah, that takes some getting used to.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.507
[attendees murmuring softly]

09:09.591 --> 09:13.762
Did you know that Nabokov's
native language was Russian

09:13.845 --> 09:17.557
but he could be a creep
in English and French as well?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.350
[all murmuring, chuckling]

09:19.434 --> 09:22.312
Someone else be interesting.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.066
Uh, well...

09:26.149 --> 09:28.610
I recently read a really interesting quote

09:28.693 --> 09:30.945
on the side of some government butter.
[inhales sharply] Ah!

09:31.029 --> 09:32.822
Uh, oh, here's a fun fact.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.575
Cats don't meow around other cats.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.535
-They only do it to mimic people.
-[woman] Fascinating.

09:37.619 --> 09:41.539
I learned that from a pop-up book
that I did not end up purchasing.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.042
Well, I just checked on the chicken.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.668
Uh, dinner is vegan, of course.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.421
The chicken is a rescue
we're raising as a child.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.923
[attendees murmuring supportively]

09:50.006 --> 09:51.132
He's doing good.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.926
[whispering] This is fun.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.177
I feel like I'm wearing glasses.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.095
[Leonora] You know,

09:55.178 --> 09:57.472
Dianne and I have had
a lot more time on our hands

09:57.555 --> 10:00.475
over these past few years,
what with making tenure...

10:00.558 --> 10:02.727
And achieving lesbian bed death.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.105
Hence, these dinners have become

10:05.188 --> 10:07.107
increasingly special to us.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.152
We only invite
the most interesting people, of course.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.155
Tamara here is a poet

10:14.239 --> 10:15.615
and arsonist.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.283
Also, I'm trans-ghost.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.577
[attendees murmuring]

10:19.661 --> 10:22.413
Edmund works
in the Columbia robotics lab.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.833
He made a robot that's racist.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.127
But why?

10:27.210 --> 10:28.336
I wonder why I'm here.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.379
You do?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.631
I guess I have made a name for myself

10:31.714 --> 10:33.800
skipping everywhere on campus.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.260
[Leonora] Ooh, and Perry here

10:35.343 --> 10:38.513
is the most promising student
in my seminar.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.015
I was so impressed
by a recent paper of his,

10:41.099 --> 10:44.310
I asked him to present it
in my intro philosophy class tomorrow.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.395
[all murmuring]

10:45.478 --> 10:48.648
Also, he is extremely poor.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.151
That's my class.

10:51.234 --> 10:55.655
I didn't realize I was in the company
of a presentation-giver.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.324
Uh, it's about the <i>Phaedo,</i>

10:58.408 --> 11:00.910
Plato's last Socratic dialogue.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.414
Some people don't realize
that many of those ancient texts

11:04.497 --> 11:05.999
were meant to be read aloud.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.292
Ha! Idiots.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.252
So I'm bringing them

11:09.335 --> 11:12.505
into the 21st century by rapping them.

11:13.006 --> 11:13.840
Whoa.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.633
The other students will be all like,

11:15.717 --> 11:18.052
"Uh, oh, my, rapping has no place
in the classroom.

11:18.136 --> 11:21.514
We only learn from books
and scrolls and-- Wait, what?"

11:24.267 --> 11:26.561
[Leonora laughing]

11:26.644 --> 11:30.231
You two remind me of me and Dianne
when we were your age.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.233
We met while protesting Nixon.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.610
Cynthia Nixon.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.738
We were very upset
she was holding up contract negotiations

11:36.821 --> 11:39.449
for the second season of <i>Sex and the City.</i>

11:39.532 --> 11:41.159
Ooh, and Kimmy is here, of course,
because she...

11:41.242 --> 11:42.619
I'm the Skipster.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.495
...is a Mole Woman.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.123
[dramatic musical sting]

11:47.206 --> 11:50.960
Wait, how did you know that I'm a--
that I <i>was </i> a Mole Woman?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.421
Oh, well, Dianne and I
google all of our students.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.923
In the hopes of finding

11:55.006 --> 11:56.799
old high school field hockey pictures.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.845
Can you believe this tuna tartare

12:00.929 --> 12:03.306
is made entirely of cashews?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.725
Mmm. Isn't it fishy?

12:05.808 --> 12:07.101
So that's why I'm here?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.353
It's not the skipping

12:08.436 --> 12:11.147
or that I can count to ten in Spanish?

12:11.230 --> 12:12.148
Well, eight.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.524
Oh, no.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.902
We wanted to discuss your experiences

12:15.985 --> 12:17.153
as a kidnapping victim.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.324
[Kimmy clears throat]

12:22.200 --> 12:23.284
Please excuse me.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.996
I have to go to the airport
to pick up Jorqueline.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.669
[Perry] Uh...

12:32.752 --> 12:34.003
[sighs]

12:34.087 --> 12:35.755
That's a shame.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.676
Kimmy, hold up.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.677
How could they do that?

12:40.760 --> 12:44.055
They googled me, like I'm some kind
of unlikely animal friendship.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.599
Look, it's just something people do.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.017
Oh, my gosh.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.268
Did you do it too?

12:49.352 --> 12:50.395
Everybody does it.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.396
You think it's an accident

12:51.479 --> 12:53.481
"google" is just "go ogle"
without the space?

12:53.564 --> 12:55.858
Sure, it's kind of a moral gray area,
but--

12:55.942 --> 12:58.277
No, some things
are pretty black-and-white.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.779
Uh, newspapers.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.489
A penguin before it goes in a blender.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.074
Rainbows if you're a dog.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.994
And snooping on people's secrets.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.954
Carry on.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.330
[sighs]

13:09.414 --> 13:10.790
I'm sorry.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.583
I thought you knew
that stuff was out there.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.585
I feel terrible
about what happened to you.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.796
Oh, so now you feel bad for me,

13:16.879 --> 13:21.134
like I'm that Muppet on <i>Sesame Street</i>
whose dad is in jail.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.387
Is that why you were so nice
about the garbage can?

13:24.470 --> 13:26.014
I-- Well, I mean,

13:26.097 --> 13:29.434
maybe that had something
to do with it, but...

13:29.517 --> 13:31.436
[chicken clucking]

13:31.519 --> 13:33.187
They're allowed to stay up late.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.439
They're not chickens.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.440
[chicken clucks]

13:35.523 --> 13:37.400
[Dianne laughs]

13:38.943 --> 13:41.029
I-- I really do like you.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.114
I don't want to hear it. I'm out of here.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.908
And by the way, I think your idea
to rap philosophy is stupid.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.577
No, that's the anger talking.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.370
It's gonna be incredible,
and everyone knows it.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.377
[phone ringing]

13:56.461 --> 13:58.546
[sighs]

13:58.629 --> 14:00.631
Jacqueline, I really
don't want to talk right now.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.633
Perfect. I don't want you to talk either.

14:02.717 --> 14:06.262
Russ may be coming home tomorrow,
and I don't know if I could handle it.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.972
<i>With smooshing victims,</i>

14:08.056 --> 14:12.185
there's a 40% chance
they'll have external funk-sacs.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.728
I don't even know what that means,

14:13.811 --> 14:16.022
but the drawing is mostly stink lines.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.523
Oh, sure, call me about this.

14:17.607 --> 14:18.775
'Cause Kimmy's the expert

14:18.858 --> 14:21.027
on messed-up bummers and shiznit.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.237
There's a lot more to me than the bunker.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.573
I can't whistle. I saw a hawk once.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.116
That sounds a lot like talking, Kimmy.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.578
I've been smooshing his picture
to try to get a sense

14:30.661 --> 14:31.788
of what I'm in for.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.289
The pamphlet says I should also

14:33.373 --> 14:34.832
be smearing it with old shrimp

14:34.916 --> 14:37.752
while listening
to haunted house sound effects.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.003
[sighs]

14:39.087 --> 14:40.505
<i>God...</i>

14:40.588 --> 14:43.800
I've never taken care of anyone
in my entire life.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.593
Even with Buckley and Xan,

14:45.676 --> 14:47.303
there was always a nanny or a horse

14:47.387 --> 14:48.304
I could leave them with.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.139
[gasps] Dang it, Xan.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.265
Has she googled me?

14:51.349 --> 14:53.059
Ugh, Kimmy, with you,

14:53.142 --> 14:56.104
it is always me, me, me, me.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.313
Mimi.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.815
I could practice on her.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.233
<i>No one's picked her up,</i>

15:00.316 --> 15:03.820
so she's just been ET-ing
in the hospital gift shop stuffed animals.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.114
[sighs]

15:08.032 --> 15:10.535
Xan, have you ever googled me?

15:10.618 --> 15:11.786
Be honest. I can take it.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.705
-Yes.
-No!

15:14.789 --> 15:16.207
This isn't happening!

15:16.290 --> 15:17.834
You know about my... stuff?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.878
Yeah. Why do you think
I'm always so nice to you?

15:20.962 --> 15:22.004
Ugh...

15:26.259 --> 15:30.179
[tense music]

15:30.263 --> 15:31.180
[Kimmy] What?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.182
No!

15:35.017 --> 15:36.102
[gasps]

15:39.689 --> 15:40.898
Ugh!

15:40.982 --> 15:42.900
[dramatic musical flourish]

15:42.984 --> 15:45.319
So it's all just out there
for anyone to surf

15:45.403 --> 15:46.362
on the World Wide Web?

15:46.446 --> 15:47.989
All they have to do is type

15:48.072 --> 15:49.991
"https colon backslash backslash

15:55.288 --> 15:57.874
Look, the Internet has
everyone's most embarrassing stuff on it,

15:57.957 --> 15:59.417
like, even mine.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.752
Type "girl poops pants at spelling bee."

16:06.174 --> 16:07.383
[Xan] <i>Mummichog.</i>

16:16.434 --> 16:17.435
[applause]

16:17.518 --> 16:19.020
That doesn't make me feel any better.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.689
I don't want your humiliation on there
any more than--

16:21.772 --> 16:22.815
Why are you still onstage?

16:22.899 --> 16:25.234
'Cause I wasn't out yet
and I had to beat Priya Patel.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.069
Well, I don't want my bunker stuff
on the Internet.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.322
I just want to be in charge of my own life
like a grown-up.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.575
Oh, grown-ups are all over the Internet.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.827
"Drunk lady at White House."

16:34.911 --> 16:36.621
This is my dad's girlfriend.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.789
[woman] <i>Someone threw up in my purse!</i>

16:39.749 --> 16:42.168
Oh, my gosh.
"Drunk lady at White Castle"?

16:42.251 --> 16:43.586
That's my therapist.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.630
Is she wearing a bathing suit?

16:45.713 --> 16:47.215
<i>Also, I did not bring a dog in here.</i>

16:47.298 --> 16:49.634
<i>I let a dog in here.</i>

16:49.717 --> 16:50.635
<i>Big difference.</i>

16:50.718 --> 16:52.094
-[dog growling]
<i>-Ow, quit biting me, dog.</i>

16:52.178 --> 16:53.846
<i>I did what you asked.</i>

[laughing]

16:55.723 --> 16:58.768
[exciting music]

17:00.269 --> 17:01.479
[Reuben] Titus.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.397
-Titus.
-[chuckles]

17:04.482 --> 17:07.984
I was just admiring baby... Linda.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.819
[Titus] So is that

17:09.904 --> 17:11.739
a family name or...

17:12.531 --> 17:14.282
No, just thought it was cute.

17:14.367 --> 17:18.119
Anyway, this place does a great eel roll.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.872
I did a great eel roll back in the day.

17:19.955 --> 17:20.873
The dance move?

17:20.957 --> 17:24.292
It's like the worm,
but you're on your side.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.461
[Linda] Mondays...

17:25.545 --> 17:27.964
What the living hell was that?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.799
-[Reuben] It's so funny.
-[Linda cries]

17:29.882 --> 17:32.718
Linda always says "Mondays"
whenever she does an oopsie.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.638
Did Linda do an oopsie?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.473
Did Linda make a poopy?

17:37.557 --> 17:38.599
It's none of your business.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.017
She's a grown woman.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.395
Uh-oh. I see what happened.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.189
Somebody got into the SlimFast again.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.440
Oh, come on.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.526
If Linda fills her purse
with the SlimFast,

17:48.609 --> 17:50.236
then she can't find her keys,

17:50.319 --> 17:53.322
and then she gets mad, doesn't she?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.491
[smooching]

17:55.575 --> 17:56.576
[Linda] Mondays!

17:56.659 --> 17:58.119
[door slams]

17:58.202 --> 18:01.831
[dramatic instrumental music]

18:01.914 --> 18:03.082
Oh. [laughs]

18:03.165 --> 18:05.084
Are you really gonna take care of me,

18:05.167 --> 18:06.085
or is this a prank,

18:06.168 --> 18:08.045
like when Jamie Kennedy proposed to me?

18:08.129 --> 18:10.131
Oh, I miss him so much.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.173
I'm here for you, Mimi.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.174
Whatever you need--

18:12.258 --> 18:14.135
The gel is slipping into my leg again!

18:14.218 --> 18:15.094
Push it up!

18:15.177 --> 18:18.097
Push it up! [whimpering]

18:19.640 --> 18:20.683
Oh, good.

18:22.810 --> 18:23.978
[upbeat jazzy music]

18:24.061 --> 18:25.313
[Jacqueline sighs]

18:25.396 --> 18:27.607
Mimi, you've got to take this.

18:27.690 --> 18:28.608
[spits]

18:28.691 --> 18:31.110
You have to trick me like a dog.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.279
I can't sit on a toilet yet,

18:33.362 --> 18:35.406
so just hold me over the bathtub.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.824
Drains is drains!

18:36.907 --> 18:38.200
[laughs]

18:38.284 --> 18:39.869
I need water!

18:39.952 --> 18:41.329
I need a blanket!

18:41.412 --> 18:44.206
I need to go tub again!

18:44.290 --> 18:45.916
Call Make-A-Wish.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.586
I want to meet Shaq!

18:49.086 --> 18:50.046
[phone chimes]

18:50.129 --> 18:51.339
Jacqueline!

18:51.422 --> 18:52.798
I just got a text!

18:52.882 --> 18:55.301
I need to do the ice bucket challenge!

18:56.636 --> 18:58.429
Jacqueline?

18:58.512 --> 19:01.265
Jacqueline!

19:01.349 --> 19:02.516
Jacqueline, Jacqueline, Jacqueline,

19:02.600 --> 19:04.977
Jacqueline, Jacqueline,
Jacqueline, Jacqueline!

19:06.646 --> 19:08.481
You better not be using up all your data.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.816
I need it for my Twitter war
with the other Titus Andromedon.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.401
I'm trying to find my old therapist.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.070
So far I've learned that

19:14.153 --> 19:17.365
she lost her license
and a wet shorts contest in Atlantic City,

19:17.448 --> 19:20.451
which means
now I'm invading people's privacy.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.535
I hate the Internet!

19:21.619 --> 19:22.745
What do you expect?

19:22.828 --> 19:24.830
It was invented by nerds,
and you know how they are.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.916
Angry 'cause they're all alone,

19:26.999 --> 19:28.209
and they know it's their fault,

19:28.292 --> 19:29.543
'cause they're always
finding little problems

19:29.627 --> 19:30.878
with every Reuben they meet.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.547
Kimmy, I don't think
I'm talking about nerds anymore.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.508
Titus, what happened last night?

19:35.591 --> 19:39.053
I flipped and ran away
like a pancake with legs.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.263
Will you make that for me
next pancake day?

19:41.347 --> 19:42.431
Please tell me this isn't about--

19:42.515 --> 19:43.724
You know it's about Linda,

19:43.808 --> 19:46.602
'cause everything about Reuben is great
except this one thing:

19:46.686 --> 19:47.770
his bitch baby.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.690
Okay, Titus,
there are adult Lindas, right?

19:50.773 --> 19:53.109
Well, at some point,
those Lindas must have been babies.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.944
What do you think they'd say
about how crazy it is

19:55.027 --> 19:56.696
for a baby to be named Linda?

19:56.779 --> 19:58.364
There's only one way to find out.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.452
I need to speak to Linda in HR.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.246
Which one?

20:05.329 --> 20:06.789
All of them.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.499
So-- So wait.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.794
The baby's name is Linda?

20:11.877 --> 20:13.295
Yes, Linda P.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.756
And I know I'm getting
in my own way like always--

20:15.840 --> 20:17.133
Uh, no, it's weird.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.218
When I was a kid, everyone called me Lulu.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.762
I didn't start going by Linda till...

20:22.263 --> 20:23.472
-after Gary left.
-Mm.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.099
And Linda is my middle name.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.892
I didn't start using it until, I guess,

20:26.976 --> 20:28.394
around the time my dog

20:28.477 --> 20:30.062
started eating at the table with me.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.857
I actually changed my name to Linda

20:32.940 --> 20:35.317
to get more jobs in HR.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.778
It's a real Lindas' club.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.363
[Linda S.] Well, in my country,

20:39.447 --> 20:41.157
it's actually pronounced "Leenda,"

20:41.240 --> 20:42.992
so it is not so weird on the baby.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.869
-That's beautiful.
-That's so nice.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.662
I love to travel.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.039
So Kimmy was wrong yet again.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.499
I'm not being crazy?

20:50.583 --> 20:53.127
No, a baby named Linda is weird,

20:53.210 --> 20:55.129
but it is the kind of thing

20:55.212 --> 20:57.047
that you can look past

20:57.131 --> 20:58.466
if you really want to.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.010
What are you saying, Lindas?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.095
[Linda P.]
After Gary left, I dated a lot of guys

21:03.179 --> 21:05.264
that really weren't right for me,

21:05.347 --> 21:07.850
but I convinced myself
that our differences

21:07.933 --> 21:10.144
were just opportunities for me to grow,

21:10.227 --> 21:12.313
even though deep down I knew

21:12.396 --> 21:14.899
I deserved to be with someone
who loved to go dancing

21:14.982 --> 21:16.942
or wasn't a Juggalo king.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.736
Of course you deserve better.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.362
You're Linda P., damn it.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.199
-Oh. [chuckles]
-And I'm Titus A.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.702
There's nothing wrong with Reuben,
but he's not right.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.205
I don't want to go to the gym

21:29.288 --> 21:30.831
or a museum called The Frick

21:30.915 --> 21:33.083
where no one laughs
when you say things like,

21:33.167 --> 21:34.502
"Why the frick did we come here?"

21:34.585 --> 21:37.171
[laughter]

21:37.254 --> 21:40.591
I guess I wanted to prove
I could move on after Mikey,

21:40.674 --> 21:43.260
so I was forcing it.

21:43.344 --> 21:47.097
Just like Reuben
is forcing his baby to be a Linda

21:47.181 --> 21:49.642
when true Lindas must ripen,

21:49.725 --> 21:52.061
like one of those things
that hang off plants.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.312
Uh, fruits and vegetables.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.356
I'm on day two, Whole30.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.607
-We should do it together.
-You already look great.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.650
-Linda--
-You'll never make it.

21:57.733 --> 21:58.776
Thanks, Lindas.

21:58.859 --> 22:02.196
Are you going to stay
for Karen's birthday cupcakes?

22:02.279 --> 22:05.783
Uh, is Linda D. proud of her nephew?
[laughs]

22:05.866 --> 22:07.493
You know I am. Stop it, girl.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.495
[laughter]

22:14.750 --> 22:16.460
Hey, if I hook you guys up,

22:16.544 --> 22:18.754
will you drive me
to my boyfriend's wife's house later?

22:21.590 --> 22:22.550
Hi, Dr. Bayden.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.177
Kimmy.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.680
What a terrible surprise.

22:27.763 --> 22:28.806
How'd you find me?

22:28.889 --> 22:29.932
The Internet.

22:30.558 --> 22:31.559
I googled you,

22:31.642 --> 22:34.228
and there are a ton of complaints
about your piercings on Yelp.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.563
Well, that's just Tevin.

22:35.646 --> 22:36.647
Hey, Tevin!

22:36.730 --> 22:39.942
You're lucky I'm not legally allowed
to come over there.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.030
We used to hook up.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.616
Are you still drinking?

22:47.700 --> 22:48.951
Like you're so perfect.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.744
-You're drunk right now.
-No, I'm not.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.538
Then why are you dressed like that?

22:52.621 --> 22:55.624
[laughing]

22:57.001 --> 22:58.210
Okay, look.

22:58.294 --> 22:59.420
I need your help.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.796
The last time I saw you,

23:00.879 --> 23:02.965
you said the only three people
I can change

23:03.048 --> 23:04.341
are me, myself, and I.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.927
But what if that's not true?

23:07.011 --> 23:08.429
No matter how hard I try,

23:08.512 --> 23:11.015
the old messed-up me
is still stuck in the Net.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.933
Okay, what'd you do, google yourself?

23:13.017 --> 23:14.435
Yeah, that's a mistake.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.478
Have you seen
"girl poops pants at spelling bee"?

23:16.562 --> 23:17.980
Humiliating.

23:18.063 --> 23:18.981
And that's coming from

23:19.064 --> 23:21.775
"Psychiatrist poops floor at conference."

23:21.859 --> 23:23.569
Yeah, I googled myself.

23:23.652 --> 23:24.987
And so did the guy I like

23:25.070 --> 23:26.071
and a professor

23:26.155 --> 23:27.573
and, I guess, everybody.

23:27.656 --> 23:30.534
You know, I should have
just stayed Kimmy Smith.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.077
At least she was free to live her life--

23:32.161 --> 23:33.287
[Andrea] No.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.998
Kimmy Schmidt is free, okay?

23:36.081 --> 23:38.083
She can just assume that everybody

23:38.167 --> 23:39.335
already knows everything

23:39.418 --> 23:41.128
and stop worrying about it.

23:42.963 --> 23:43.964
Hey, mall!

23:44.048 --> 23:46.842
This chick got bunkered!

23:46.925 --> 23:47.843
Ah, big time!

23:47.927 --> 23:49.595
-Shut your face!
-Bigly!

23:49.678 --> 23:51.931
Long time-- [slurping]

23:55.768 --> 23:58.729
Okay, here's my point.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.564
Think of all the time and energy

24:00.648 --> 24:02.691
you have spent keeping your secret,

24:02.775 --> 24:04.485
deciding whom to tell,

24:04.568 --> 24:07.321
always looking over your shoulder
with that big ol' pumpkin head of yours.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.405
What are you? Irish?

24:08.489 --> 24:10.616
Man, they've got some heads.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.204
So lookit, what if you didn't
have to put in all that effort, okay?

24:15.287 --> 24:16.914
Worrying, hiding,

24:16.997 --> 24:18.415
taking a bus to New Jersey

24:18.499 --> 24:20.959
to get advice
from a unlicensed psychiatrist

24:21.043 --> 24:22.294
with a loaded gun in her tights.

24:22.378 --> 24:23.379
[Kimmy] What?

24:24.213 --> 24:27.591
To quote Elsa, "Let it go!"

24:27.675 --> 24:29.718
Elsa is my boyfriend's wife.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.096
I grabbed her hair
at a high school basketball game.

24:34.098 --> 24:37.184
So, what, I'm just supposed
to pretend I don't care?

24:37.267 --> 24:39.895
No, you're supposed to not care.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.022
Look, what would you be doing right now

24:42.106 --> 24:43.816
if you weren't in Bumbledick, New Jersey,

24:43.899 --> 24:45.317
trying to get in my pants?

24:45.401 --> 24:48.737
Well, I guess
I'd be heading to class to see my...

24:48.821 --> 24:52.241
friend give a rap lecture
on Greek philosophy.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.992
Yes, go do that.

24:55.661 --> 24:56.954
Thanks, Andrea.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.338
God, there's so many bugs in here.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.427
Titus.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.429
Um, come in.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.144
What happened last night?

25:20.227 --> 25:22.104
-I went to pick up Linda...
-Mm.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.230
When we turned around, you disappeared

25:23.313 --> 25:25.482
like the table
at that magic show I took you to.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.776
[inhales deeply]
I'm glad you mentioned your love of magic.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.820
It's part of why I'm here. [exhales]

25:29.903 --> 25:32.239
Reuben, like that leopard print unitard

25:32.322 --> 25:35.159
I bought on the sidewalk,
I wanted this to work,

25:35.242 --> 25:36.660
but it doesn't.

25:36.744 --> 25:38.662
You haven't seen <i>The Bodyguard.</i>

25:38.746 --> 25:39.830
I don't want to eat eels.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.165
What if I get electrocuted?

25:41.248 --> 25:42.166
Well, you're not perfect either,

25:42.249 --> 25:44.626
Mr. "I Fell Asleep
on the Floor of The Frick."

25:44.710 --> 25:47.045
But when Tilda Swinton does it, it's art.
[scoffs]

25:47.129 --> 25:49.590
Plus, you're afraid of a vacuum cleaner.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.717
You gave up
halfway through a revolving door.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.261
When I brought you a bouquet, you ate it.

25:54.344 --> 25:57.848
I thought it was a Edible Arrangement.
I don't have a lot of fruit experience.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.434
Also, you're weird
for naming a baby Linda.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.269
Well, you live with
a grown woman named Kimmy.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.188
But I did not name her that.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.273
Then maybe this is for the best.

26:06.982 --> 26:07.816
For both of us.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.194
Uh-uh, ain't nobody tracking
what this says about you.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.529
Titus is growing. You are devastated.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.114
See you at choir practice.

26:14.198 --> 26:15.699
I will be late, because a bunch of us

26:15.783 --> 26:18.160
are getting margaritas
for Karen's birthday.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.582
[students murmuring indistinctly]

26:23.665 --> 26:26.585
[whimsical music]

26:28.000 --> 26:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

26:40.516 --> 26:41.975
[clears throat]

26:43.560 --> 26:44.853
Socrates,

26:44.937 --> 26:46.814
Plato, Aristotle.
