WEBVTT

00:11.750 --> 00:13.041
I'm Anderson Cooper.

00:13.125 --> 00:16.583
I'm rich, I'm hot,
I don't need this.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.166
Earlier tonight, President Trump

00:18.250 --> 00:19.166
released his
March Madness bracket.

00:19.250 --> 00:22.375
- Take a look.
- Big fan of March Madness.

00:22.458 --> 00:25.667
It will distract Americans
while I pay off Stormy Daniels

00:25.750 --> 00:28.625
by making her
my top economic adviser.

00:28.709 --> 00:29.667
She's got big shoes to fill.

00:29.750 --> 00:32.875
No one put out for billionaires
like Gary Cohn.

00:32.959 --> 00:36.583
Anyways, my March Madness
prediction... Bulls in seven.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.166
Wow. I'm being told

00:38.250 --> 00:40.375
the leader of the free world
is on the line?

00:40.458 --> 00:42.166
Hey, Anderson,
this trade war's gonna be fun!

00:42.250 --> 00:45.166
You ready to pay 50 bucks
for a stapler?

00:45.250 --> 00:47.458
What's going on with
your steel tariffs?

00:47.542 --> 00:48.709
Get ready!

00:48.792 --> 00:51.625
Buildings swaying in the breeze
like fields of wheat.

00:51.709 --> 00:54.500
How do you respond to reports
of chaos in the White House?

00:54.583 --> 00:58.000
Don't for a second believe that
this White House is in chaos.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.291
We're like
a well-oiled tornado.

01:00.375 --> 01:02.792
Any thoughts on Ted Cruz
winning his primary?

01:02.875 --> 01:05.333
Before this decade is out,
we will make Ted Cruz

01:05.417 --> 01:08.750
the first man to involuntarily
walk on the Moon!

01:08.834 --> 01:11.750
Jesus.
When we come back,

01:11.834 --> 01:13.834
who will be the next sycophant
to blow this wide open?

01:13.917 --> 01:18.875
Hey! Anderson!
Am I gonna be on the show?!

01:18.959 --> 01:21.625
Ted Cruz has won his
primary and stands ready

01:21.709 --> 01:24.750
to earn your vote to return
to the United States Senate.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.542
He supports a flat tax of 0.0%

01:27.625 --> 01:30.417
and believes the only way
to stop a bad guy with a gun

01:30.500 --> 01:32.000
is 20 good teachers
shooting guns

01:32.083 --> 01:33.000
like out-of-control fire hoses.

01:33.083 --> 01:35.041
And to America's
next generation,

01:35.125 --> 01:37.166
Ted Cruz won't just
pay you lip service.

01:37.250 --> 01:40.500
He'll be your personal
"A Wrinkle in Time" god

01:40.583 --> 01:43.834
ready to fold time and space
to find your dad.

01:43.917 --> 01:46.417
The freedom of
a golden chalice of horse,

01:46.500 --> 01:47.291
horse liberty, and freedom

01:47.375 --> 01:49.834
riding along
according to the Bible

01:49.917 --> 01:50.834
and the Lord and the values.

01:50.917 --> 01:53.041
And so forth.

01:53.125 --> 01:54.709
This message has been paid for
and approved by...

01:54.792 --> 01:56.250
a-Ted Cruz!

01:56.333 --> 01:58.500
Ted Cruz! Ted Cruz! Ted Cruz!
Ted Cruz! Ta-doo da-doh!

02:01.750 --> 02:03.750
Unh! Oof!

02:11.291 --> 02:15.083
President Trump
is in North Dakota

02:15.166 --> 02:17.709
for a cam... paign-style rally,

02:17.792 --> 02:19.583
cele... brating the completion

02:19.667 --> 02:22.375
of a colossal frito pie
in his likeness.

02:22.458 --> 02:24.208
The media has been
cordoned into a pen

02:24.291 --> 02:28.208
usually reserved
for pig insemination.

02:28.291 --> 02:29.208
And reporters
have already been menaced

02:29.291 --> 02:33.041
and, in one unfortunate case,
inseminated.

02:33.125 --> 02:37.000
Fox News' Ed Henry is expecting.

02:37.083 --> 02:40.166
Mazel tov on your
gestating man-beast.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.500
Let's go there live.

02:41.583 --> 02:43.250
Wow.

02:43.333 --> 02:44.625
We're having a great time,
right, folks?

02:44.709 --> 02:48.458
Look at all those people in the
back hiding behind the cameras,

02:48.542 --> 02:51.083
broadcasting real things
I say and do.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.333
What do we call them?

02:52.417 --> 02:54.458
Fake news!

02:54.542 --> 02:55.750
That's right!

02:55.834 --> 02:56.417
And they won't tell you this,

02:56.500 --> 02:57.500
but I was born and raised

02:57.583 --> 03:01.333
right here in North Dakota
under these bleachers!

03:01.417 --> 03:05.583
The land beneath your feet
was my playground.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.041
And what the hell?
I'm 90% Sioux Indian!

03:08.125 --> 03:10.250
- Yeah!
- Make America great again!

03:10.333 --> 03:13.458
And you know what?
The lying media also

03:13.542 --> 03:16.834
won't admit that my poll numbers
are through the frickin' roof!

03:16.917 --> 03:18.917
We're talking
Gaddafi in his prime!

03:19.000 --> 03:20.917
Look, I don't even have a TV.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.709
I mean, I'm more of a book guy.

03:22.792 --> 03:23.625
I breast-fed my boys.

03:23.709 --> 03:26.291
I started the whole
undershirt trend.

03:26.375 --> 03:29.667
I was conceived when
the first atomic bomb dropped

03:29.750 --> 03:32.333
and born when
the second one dropped!

03:32.417 --> 03:33.959
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

03:34.041 --> 03:36.250
All you crowbar owners,

03:36.333 --> 03:39.333
I'm not calling for violence
against the media,

03:39.417 --> 03:43.792
but let me just say that
their skulls are full of candy!

03:46.542 --> 03:48.458
Setting aside that
the President said

03:48.542 --> 03:51.250
members of the press
"make good ingredients,"

03:51.333 --> 03:53.792
does he stand behind
his repeated lies?

03:53.875 --> 03:55.458
It's the position
of this administration

03:55.542 --> 03:57.250
that everything
the President says is true

03:57.333 --> 03:59.083
or becomes true
the moment he says it.

03:59.166 --> 04:02.125
So you won't admit that the
President misspoke when he said

04:02.208 --> 04:04.375
there's never been
a movie about lawyers?

04:04.458 --> 04:06.083
The President
will not be hamstrung

04:06.166 --> 04:08.583
by the arbitrary,
half-baked concept of logic.

04:08.667 --> 04:09.750
Oh,
you got to be kidding.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.125
- Come on!
- Jesus Christ.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.000
And up next on
the "The Ridiculist,"

04:13.083 --> 04:15.583
is Trump's presidency
rolling away from him?

04:15.667 --> 04:18.333
According to Melania's eyes,
it is.

04:18.416 --> 04:20.875
Take a look at this eye-roll
during the President's speech.

04:20.959 --> 04:23.542
Ugh. Here's what our CNN
eye-language expert had to say.

04:23.625 --> 04:26.166
Well, the First Lady's eye-roll
tells me that she thinks

04:26.250 --> 04:28.834
her husband is in over his head.

04:28.917 --> 04:30.333
Also, she's unhappy

04:30.417 --> 04:33.166
because he calls the ice-cream
freezer his real wife.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.834
Wow.
He's perceptive.

04:34.917 --> 04:37.750
Melania, I want you
to answer me honestly.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.000
Were those your eyes?

04:39.083 --> 04:42.959
Yes, but cut me some slack.
I-I just did it once.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.000
That's just the start.
Take a look.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.792
Name one Italian person

04:46.875 --> 04:49.208
who doesn't like meatballs.

04:49.291 --> 04:52.208
I used to be the
face of Neutrogena.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.375
I made Oprah wear
all that weird shit

04:54.458 --> 04:56.875
for that
"A Wrinkle in Time" movie.

04:56.959 --> 05:00.667
All right, I did it a lot,
but I can't control it.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.625
It's like how you can't talk
to someone in leg braces

05:03.709 --> 05:04.542
without commenting
on them.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.625
Honey, whenever your face
undermines me,

05:07.709 --> 05:10.375
it makes my job even harder
than it already is.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.917
Now let's watch another
seven hours of TV.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.041
All I ever
hear around here is no.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.291
Look, nuking the ocean

05:17.375 --> 05:18.291
is the only way we're
gonna get rid of the sharks.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.709
Sir, I wouldn't
bring this up

05:20.792 --> 05:22.709
if not for the graveness
of the situation,

05:22.792 --> 05:24.250
but I believe we may
have a media problem.

05:24.333 --> 05:25.375
- Who cares?
- What is the matter?

05:25.458 --> 05:28.667
I think the paperboy
is in love with my wife.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.208
But you've been saying my press
is great ever since I fired

05:31.291 --> 05:33.875
your predecessor for
saying I had bad press.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I've been operating
under the assumption

05:36.083 --> 05:37.291
that "great" means
"a dizzying amount."

05:37.375 --> 05:40.041
The major networks
are simulcasting

05:40.125 --> 05:41.500
a star-studded benefit
to bribe you to quit,

05:41.583 --> 05:44.166
and The Washington Post
changed their slogan

05:44.250 --> 05:46.083
from "Democracy
dies in darkness"

05:46.166 --> 05:47.417
to "Democracy died,

05:47.500 --> 05:50.125
and the President is
balls-deep in the corpse."

05:51.333 --> 05:54.583
Donald, did you know
Jackie O

05:54.667 --> 05:58.333
never rolled her eyes once
during JFK's speeches?

05:58.417 --> 06:00.417
I want to be like that,

06:00.500 --> 06:03.583
the Washington woman with a face
like a haunted mansion,

06:03.667 --> 06:09.083
a beautiful exterior concealing
screaming ghouls inside.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.250
That's great, Melania.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.917
I don't need to know
what's inside you

06:12.000 --> 06:13.083
any more than I need to know
what's inside my book.

06:13.166 --> 06:15.667
Can you find someone
to teach me?

06:15.750 --> 06:20.458
Of course. And the effort will
be so worth it, believe me.

06:20.542 --> 06:21.667
You know,
I've come this far

06:21.750 --> 06:24.000
only because
I don't show my emotions.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.959
What the fuck? Who the hell
moved my goddamn Ring Pop?!

06:27.041 --> 06:28.500
I'm gonna kill somebody!

06:28.583 --> 06:31.125
All right, people.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.625
I need an update
on the signature legislation

06:33.709 --> 06:35.625
that will define my legacy...

06:35.709 --> 06:39.959
The bill that finally reduces
the air in potato-chip bags.

06:40.041 --> 06:42.125
Last week, I lobbied
Congressional leaders,

06:42.208 --> 06:45.667
and they all said, "If baby
wants his bottle, then fine."

06:45.750 --> 06:48.291
I believe they were
complimenting your
youthful skin.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.458
That was last week,
before the media

06:50.542 --> 06:52.166
completely turned on you
and pilloried the bill.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.625
What?
Are you kidding me?

06:54.709 --> 06:57.125
That legislation was the only
hill I was willing to die on.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.750
Well, you should've
thought of that

06:58.834 --> 07:00.333
before you
called on supporters

07:00.417 --> 07:02.166
to make furniture out of
the media's bones.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.500
If I let them derail
my potato-chip agenda,

07:03.583 --> 07:05.625
I won't be able
to look at the man I see

07:05.709 --> 07:09.709
in the two gigantic mirrors
placed side by side!

07:09.792 --> 07:11.417
Melania,
you asked for someone

07:11.500 --> 07:14.542
who could teach you
to hide your emotions,

07:14.625 --> 07:16.417
so I searched the world,
and lo and behold,

07:16.500 --> 07:19.792
the perfect person
was down the hall

07:19.875 --> 07:23.208
and fit perfectly
under our bed sheet.

07:23.291 --> 07:26.667
Press secretary
Sarah Huckabee Sanders!

07:26.750 --> 07:29.333
Look at that blank face.
She's not even mad

07:29.417 --> 07:31.291
that I had her stand
under that sheet all night.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.250
When I'm done with you,
your face will not show

07:33.333 --> 07:35.583
guilt, shame,
joy, or fury.

07:35.667 --> 07:38.000
Instead, it will be an
unconquerable fortress

07:38.083 --> 07:38.917
covered in rocks
and spikes.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.542
It's beautiful.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.542
Dad, you got to put the media
in their place,

07:43.625 --> 07:46.291
or they'll just, like,
bark and shit

07:46.375 --> 07:48.625
all over the house
like Eric.
Yeah!

07:48.709 --> 07:51.875
I can't manipulate the
entire media. It's huge.

07:51.959 --> 07:53.750
There's like four news channels,
three newspapers,

07:53.834 --> 07:57.875
plus Lonnie and the whole
104.5 morning zoo crew.

07:57.959 --> 08:00.583
The media may be huge,
but you're hugerer.

08:00.667 --> 08:01.792
You need to bribe them,
manipulate them,

08:01.875 --> 08:05.000
be the guy who extorted
a New York Post reporter

08:05.083 --> 08:06.792
so they'd say you're
good at tennis.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.458
Yeah! The guy who convinced
The Village Voice

08:08.542 --> 08:13.083
to declare you the
Downtown Club Queen of 1986!

08:13.166 --> 08:14.709
The guy who called
The Wall Street Journal

08:14.792 --> 08:17.917
posing as a talking money clip
upset about how hard it was

08:18.000 --> 08:19.250
to hold all your cash.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.250
Ah, good old Clippo.
You're right, Don.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.583
The press shouldn't be allowed
to say whatever it wants

08:24.667 --> 08:25.750
as much as I'm not allowed
to say whatever I want.

08:25.834 --> 08:28.583
I'm only allowed to say
what my brain tells my mouth,

08:28.667 --> 08:31.333
and the media
should be no different.

08:31.417 --> 08:32.917
Fuck yeah!
All of that!

08:34.000 --> 08:40.073
Advertise your product or brand here

08:42.708 --> 08:46.792
President Trump has summoned
prominent media figures

08:46.875 --> 08:49.500
to the White House to rebuild
the damaged relation... ship.

08:49.583 --> 08:52.709
I was told to stay home,
but that's okay,

08:52.792 --> 08:54.750
because my wife
is my best friend,

08:54.834 --> 08:56.583
and we have great conversations.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.375
Wow. Look at this.
Isn't this tremendous?

08:58.458 --> 09:00.417
Isn't it cozy?
The media's here.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.458
So great.
You're not fake news.

09:03.542 --> 09:04.667
You're real news.

09:04.750 --> 09:07.709
Oh, look!
It's Rachel Maddow. Yay!

09:07.792 --> 09:09.625
And is that
Anderson Cooper I see?

09:09.709 --> 09:11.959
Handsome Andy...
That's what I call him.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.583
We're really
hitting it off, right?

09:13.667 --> 09:15.792
Oh, hey, what do you say
we start over,

09:15.875 --> 09:18.625
and you report that I'm
the best president in history?

09:18.709 --> 09:20.458
Sir, all that
we can promise

09:20.542 --> 09:23.583
is that we will report
the facts as we see them.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.750
Screw you, Cooper, and
your Judi Dench haircut!

09:27.834 --> 09:30.750
Maddow, how many blazers
do you own?! All of 'em?!

09:30.834 --> 09:32.083
Dickerson,
just how many people

09:32.166 --> 09:34.583
have you drowned in those
beautiful blue eyes?

09:34.667 --> 09:36.875
Why can't you all
be like Hannity and
just report the facts?

09:36.959 --> 09:40.500
Donald Trump's sperm would
impregnate a block of gypsum!

09:40.583 --> 09:42.458
Sir, if I may,
we are journalists, damn it,

09:42.542 --> 09:44.458
and that means we hold
the powerful accountable

09:44.542 --> 09:46.083
as long as it earns
our parent companies

09:46.166 --> 09:47.166
tanker ships
full of cash.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.709
All right, bribe time.

09:48.792 --> 09:50.291
How many buckets of chicken will
it take to buy your opinions?

09:50.375 --> 09:51.959
I have all kinds...
Barbecue, fried.

09:52.041 --> 09:53.375
Forget it.
I'll make a list.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.417
I was gonna do it at
some point today, anyway.

09:55.500 --> 09:59.500
If you want to look composed
around any old world leader,

09:59.583 --> 10:01.417
I would recommend
a shot of Botox.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.834
But this is Donald Trump,

10:02.917 --> 10:04.959
so we need to kill
your face outright.

10:05.041 --> 10:06.291
Now watch the screen.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.208
Ooh. Beautiful deer.

10:08.291 --> 10:10.125
What the...

10:10.208 --> 10:12.083
Aah!

10:12.166 --> 10:13.000
Why would you show me this?!

10:13.083 --> 10:15.709
Your husband's capable
of saying worse.

10:15.792 --> 10:17.333
Now deaden that face.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.375
At least the driver
was not injured.

10:18.458 --> 10:19.792
Oh, my God!

10:19.875 --> 10:21.333
- No, no, no!
- Oh, my God!

10:21.417 --> 10:23.333
That is the worst thing
I've ever seen!

10:23.417 --> 10:24.834
Oh, he's in surgery.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.542
He's... He's going to
be okay, right, Sarah?

10:26.625 --> 10:29.417
- Right?
- Watch the screen.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.291
The doctor's a clown.

10:31.375 --> 10:32.917
And a cannibal!

10:33.000 --> 10:35.041
N-o-o-o-o!!

10:35.125 --> 10:36.542
Remember the drill...

10:36.625 --> 10:38.542
You tell the press that I'm
pen pals with some poor kid

10:38.625 --> 10:41.625
and I give him
tons of advice and money.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.834
Classic Trump move...

10:42.917 --> 10:46.542
Plant a positive story and
watch the great press come in.

10:46.625 --> 10:47.917
CNN tip line.
How can I help you?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.875
Hi. Uh, I'm 9 years old,
and President Trump calls me

10:51.959 --> 10:54.667
every morning to give me
advice and lots of money.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.834
Uh-huh. Nice story. And
what's your name, young man?

10:57.917 --> 10:59.375
Uh, Guy Callmaker?

10:59.458 --> 11:01.750
Oh, fuck, crap, shit!

11:01.834 --> 11:03.041
They practically
put me on trial!

11:03.125 --> 11:06.709
It's all right. Calm down
while Eric gives it a shot.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.083
Well, should be
pretty easy for me.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.917
6th grade, I played a yellow
brick in "Wizard of Oz,"

11:12.000 --> 11:13.709
so pretty much
got that down.

11:13.792 --> 11:16.875
CNN tip line.
How can I help you?

11:16.959 --> 11:22.917
Uh, h-hello.
I'm... Johnny... P-Phonedialer.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.959
I'm a brick, and I would
like to plant a story!

11:26.041 --> 11:28.333
Crap!

11:28.417 --> 11:29.166
Jesus Christ.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.000
It's all right.
Just calm down.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.875
Let's let Don Junior
try it again.

11:32.959 --> 11:37.083
I didn't realize how much
your face showed emotion,

11:37.166 --> 11:38.750
so your training
will be more intense,

11:38.834 --> 11:40.417
starting at the end
of this sentence.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.750
Oh, no.
What's going to happen?

11:42.834 --> 11:47.000
- Ted Cruz!
- N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!!

11:47.083 --> 11:50.000
Looking beautiful, as always,
Madam First Lady!

11:50.083 --> 11:52.041
Sarah and I
worked out a deal.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.959
She'll circle a bunch
of cars in the desert

11:54.041 --> 11:56.709
so I can fight Mike Pence
for the Vice Presidency,

11:56.792 --> 11:59.166
and I'll talk about things
like I'm the only man on Earth

11:59.250 --> 12:00.583
who grows hair
into his body.

12:00.667 --> 12:05.041
That's right...
Every hair is ingrown!

12:05.125 --> 12:05.959
Dermatologists
can't explain it,

12:06.041 --> 12:09.458
theologists curse it,
and cats hiss at it.

12:09.542 --> 12:10.792
I don't want
to do this anymore!

12:10.875 --> 12:13.792
We are at war with the media,
and war is hell.

12:13.875 --> 12:14.792
Kill me now!

12:14.875 --> 12:17.583
Remember, your face
should be as lifeless

12:17.667 --> 12:19.625
as a dog after your
brother shoots it.

12:19.709 --> 12:20.959
Do it, Melania.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.959
Okay.
I'll try.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.500
You ever think
about how words

12:25.583 --> 12:27.959
don't sound as disturbing
if you sing them?

12:28.041 --> 12:29.291
♪ Organ failure ♪

12:29.375 --> 12:31.291
♪ Shattered pelvis ♪

12:31.375 --> 12:33.291
♪ Internal hair! ♪

12:33.375 --> 12:34.667
Ted Cruz! Ted Cruz!

12:36.333 --> 12:37.625
This is the footage
that explains

12:37.709 --> 12:39.417
the totality
of the threat, sir.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.500
Our great, handsome,
fashion-forward Dear Leader,

12:42.583 --> 12:44.333
who is a very skilled
shark wrestler

12:44.417 --> 12:45.458
and the world's
funniest astronaut,

12:45.542 --> 12:48.417
has once again successfully
launched a missile

12:48.500 --> 12:50.709
over Japanese airspace
to the great joy

12:50.792 --> 12:53.542
of the albino cucumbers
that heralded his birth.

12:53.625 --> 12:54.667
Wow. She's great.

12:54.750 --> 12:57.333
Can we get her to do my
next Super Bowl one-on-one?

12:57.417 --> 12:58.375
Sir, we're only
showing this

12:58.458 --> 13:01.333
as proof of North Korea's
nuclear capability.

13:01.417 --> 13:03.959
You're freaking out about
a glorified firecracker,

13:04.041 --> 13:05.583
plus or minus
a few Hawaiian islands?

13:05.667 --> 13:08.125
You're completely ignoring

13:08.208 --> 13:10.834
North Korea's
far more powerful weapon...

13:10.917 --> 13:13.583
A completely obedient
news media.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.000
Because they execute those
who disagree with them.

13:16.083 --> 13:18.834
Wow. They're even more
advanced than I thought.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.208
- Melania.
- Oh, no, not you.

13:22.291 --> 13:23.583
We have to
pause our training.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.125
We need to go
comfort children

13:25.208 --> 13:26.875
who watched baby sea otters
swim into a boat propeller.

13:26.959 --> 13:30.041
Okay. Let's go there
and talk to them.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.208
Does your face feel
like crying or anythin'?

13:32.291 --> 13:36.875
I feel like crying,
but the tears are not coming.

13:36.959 --> 13:39.542
I wanted to execute
the mainstream media

13:39.625 --> 13:42.041
like North Korea gets to,

13:42.125 --> 13:44.291
but, uh, apparently
that's a legal headache.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.542
Instead, I just revoked
their credentials.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.625
On that note, a warm welcome

13:48.709 --> 13:50.667
to the new and improved
press corps...

13:50.750 --> 13:53.041
Fox News, Daily Caller,
Newsmax, News Guzzler,

13:53.125 --> 13:56.458
The Weekly Liberty Townhall
Freedom Shrieker,

13:56.542 --> 13:57.583
and the rest.

13:58.875 --> 14:02.625
Uh, Randy Dosh from
Randy Dosh Info Wash.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.583
When did you realize

14:03.667 --> 14:05.583
you were the greatest
President in history?

14:05.667 --> 14:08.750
W-Wow.
Not until just now.

14:08.834 --> 14:09.750
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.

14:09.834 --> 14:12.500
Mr. President!
Mr. President!

14:12.583 --> 14:15.542
Biff Conyers, Capital Beacon,
founded 1794.

14:15.625 --> 14:16.417
Do you consider yourself

14:16.500 --> 14:19.208
a snatch master or
more of a pussy lord?

14:19.291 --> 14:22.041
Whoa! Take it easy!
My wife, Melanie's, here.

14:22.125 --> 14:23.625
I-I mean...

14:23.709 --> 14:26.792
Look at that blank mug.
Isn't she great, folks?

14:29.709 --> 14:32.917
Wow. You guys really go along
with everything, huh?

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Melania,
you were amazing!

14:36.083 --> 14:38.125
I mean, you didn't bat an eye
when I called you Melanie,

14:38.208 --> 14:39.709
claimed I played in the NBA,

14:39.792 --> 14:42.375
or put that dumb hat on you
and told everyone to laugh.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.917
I know.
It's really great, right?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.959
All right, cool.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.959
Uh, by the way, I just used
your wedding dress to sop up

14:49.041 --> 14:52.125
some bolognese I spilled
in your closet.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.667
That's terrible.

14:53.750 --> 14:56.208
What in God's name
were you thinking?

14:56.291 --> 14:59.125
You okay, Melania? Your face
really isn't moving at all.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.625
I know.
That's what I wanted.

15:00.709 --> 15:03.250
Well, big day tomorrow.

15:03.333 --> 15:06.291
I'm gonna watch TV
until the sun comes up.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.125
Sir, that press
conference was amazing!

15:10.208 --> 15:12.792
I haven't seen something that
awesome since my friend Gary

15:12.875 --> 15:13.625
shot a python
out of a potato gun.

15:13.709 --> 15:14.875
I don't know, Stevie.

15:14.959 --> 15:17.500
I thought I wanted
an adoring press,

15:17.583 --> 15:19.792
but it feels wrong to have
something come so easy

15:19.875 --> 15:21.500
after a lifetime of hurdles.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.667
You know, it's easy
to spice things up.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.542
Just put out a vase full
of nose candy and sex toys.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.041
When Karen and I want
to spice things up,

15:29.125 --> 15:31.000
I'll say something
a little crazy.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.333
For example, last night,

15:32.417 --> 15:34.917
I told her the weather
in a city we weren't even in.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.792
That made her as spiced
as an Easter ham!

15:37.875 --> 15:38.750
You know, I never
thought of saying something

15:38.834 --> 15:41.792
just to get a rise
out of people.

15:43.291 --> 15:45.542
Melania,
Sarah Huckabee Sanders

15:45.625 --> 15:49.041
told us the wonderful news
that you killed your face,

15:49.125 --> 15:51.000
and we just wanted
to get together

15:51.083 --> 15:52.333
and say congratulations

15:52.417 --> 15:56.208
and recommend some creams to
keep your cheeks from rotting.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.458
Thank you very much,
Pelosi.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.959
It's good thinking to kill your
face while it's in its prime.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.041
Mine died at age 71

16:03.125 --> 16:06.917
when I accidentally
power-sawed my beloved cat.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
You know, everyone
in Washington

16:09.083 --> 16:11.583
kills their face
for different reasons.

16:11.667 --> 16:15.291
Some women, like me, do it
for political expediency.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.750
Some men do it to keep
their faces from twitching

16:17.834 --> 16:19.000
when they're
saying things like,

16:19.083 --> 16:22.792
"Taxing the poor is the only way
to help the less fortunate."

16:22.875 --> 16:25.125
But no matter
what your motivation,

16:25.208 --> 16:27.291
know that it's only
the first step.

16:27.375 --> 16:29.375
To complete
the transformation,

16:29.458 --> 16:31.250
you also have to
kill your thoughts!

16:31.333 --> 16:35.667
Wait. If I don't have
my thoughts, then who am I?

16:35.750 --> 16:39.083
Those are just the thoughts
you won't be having.

16:39.166 --> 16:43.417
Sir, if you really want to
get a rise out of the media,

16:43.500 --> 16:44.917
I have a tank full of
hundreds of scorpions

16:45.000 --> 16:46.750
I've been shaking
for weeks.

16:46.834 --> 16:49.083
I'm not saying no yet,

16:49.166 --> 16:52.917
but first, I'm gonna try
saying some offbeat stuff.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.709
Hey, everyone.
Got some news.

16:54.792 --> 16:58.250
We're gonna nuke Norway!

16:58.333 --> 16:59.917
I'm sure the snatch master
knows what he's doing.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.917
- That seems fine.
- Nicely done.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.458
What the hell?
They're okay with that?

17:04.541 --> 17:05.916
I hold in my hand

17:06.000 --> 17:10.250
a rare copy of the
Declaration of Independence.

17:13.416 --> 17:15.290
Aaaaah!

17:15.375 --> 17:16.959
It's a great day
for America!

17:21.458 --> 17:24.875
You were supposed to
stop my eye-rolling,

17:24.959 --> 17:27.000
not kill my face so badly

17:27.083 --> 17:29.166
that I end up in
Pelosi's army of the dead!

17:29.250 --> 17:32.458
If anything, I think
Nancy Pelosi is too expressive.

17:32.542 --> 17:34.834
I want my old face back.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.709
Sorry, Melania.
When you kill a face,

17:36.792 --> 17:38.291
you can't bring it
back to life

17:38.375 --> 17:40.125
until you kill
someone else's face.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.208
Is that true?

17:41.291 --> 17:43.291
No, but it'd make
a pretty cool movie, huh?

17:43.375 --> 17:44.125
- Want to write it with me?
- No!

17:44.208 --> 17:47.500
I don't want anything
to do with you

17:47.583 --> 17:49.750
or your pretty solid ideas
for movies.

17:49.834 --> 17:51.125
Goodbye!

17:52.000 --> 17:54.959
Dude, Dad,
you should be psyched.

17:55.041 --> 17:55.750
I've set a ton of people's
eyeballs on fire,

17:55.834 --> 17:57.959
and they never like it.

17:58.041 --> 18:00.625
But the media is so
frickin' boring now.

18:00.709 --> 18:03.792
I mean, you should've never told
me to put them in their place.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.458
You should've known
that I'd do too good a job.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.458
I always do
too good a job.

18:08.542 --> 18:11.583
Don't put this on me, Dad.
These are your ideas.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.542
I just show them off
like a cool car

18:13.625 --> 18:15.417
that you would
drive around a cliff

18:15.500 --> 18:17.125
and everyone would point
and look and be like,

18:17.208 --> 18:19.166
"Wow! What a cool car!
That guy is cool!"

18:19.250 --> 18:22.375
Well, guess what, Don.
I plunged into the cliff.

18:22.458 --> 18:23.917
My brains are everywhere,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.625
and Clippo's not around
to call an ambulance.

18:38.583 --> 18:39.750
Hannity!

18:39.834 --> 18:41.834
The liberals want us to
quarter immigrants in our houses

18:41.917 --> 18:43.166
and let them bang our wives?!

18:43.250 --> 18:45.083
Find out later the answer's yes.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.417
But first,
President Donald Trump.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.041
The floor is yours,
my liege.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.125
Sean, I'm here because
I made a huge mistake.

18:51.208 --> 18:54.917
Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut!
You can do no wrong, sir.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.125
So this is just a
five-dimensional chess game.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.291
Checkmate!

18:58.375 --> 19:00.875
Things have never been worse
between me and the media.

19:00.959 --> 19:03.166
I miss the magazine covers,
the way they look,

19:03.250 --> 19:05.542
the way they feel when
they're whipping my ass.

19:05.625 --> 19:07.208
Sir, I'd do
the whipping myself,

19:07.291 --> 19:10.500
but the homophobia's paying down
the mortgage on my lake house.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.417
I just want the fake news
media back, Sean.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.959
I'll let them put their
microphones wherever they want.

19:16.041 --> 19:17.208
And let me just say, sir,

19:17.291 --> 19:19.208
nobody takes
a microphone like you.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.875
I'm so depressed, Sean.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.750
The cheeseburgers pile up,
but I'm not eating them.

19:23.834 --> 19:26.375
I haven't cleaned
my dentures in weeks.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.709
I don't even want to start
nuclear wars anymore.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.750
All right, we got to
cheer the President up.

19:30.834 --> 19:32.750
Roll the montage of
President Donald J. Trump

19:32.834 --> 19:35.083
slurping down oysters.

19:35.166 --> 19:36.417
Always good for a laugh.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.667
Has Trump's
presidency flatlined?

19:38.750 --> 19:41.166
According to the
First Lady's face, it has.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.375
Take a look at this footage,

19:42.458 --> 19:45.208
courtesy of Randy Dosh
of Randy Dosh Info Wash,

19:45.291 --> 19:46.583
whatever the hell that is.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.542
I mean, doesn't she look
ridiculous, folks?

19:49.625 --> 19:51.417
- Am I right?
- Look at that dumb hat!

19:51.500 --> 19:52.750
Ice-queen alert.

19:52.834 --> 19:55.333
Here's what our CNN eye-language
expert had to say.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.041
Well, the First Lady's dead eyes

19:57.125 --> 19:59.625
tell me that she thinks
her husband is a buffoon.

19:59.709 --> 20:02.250
Also, she's unhappy because
he used her christening dress

20:02.333 --> 20:05.125
to clean bolognese
off her wedding dress.

20:06.667 --> 20:09.250
- I was gonna tell you.
- I just can't win.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.458
Hey, what did you say
to me, lamp?!

20:12.542 --> 20:14.500
Wow! Really?!
You know what?

20:14.583 --> 20:17.583
You're such a loser!
Everyone's saying it!

20:17.667 --> 20:20.667
What a sad lamp.
A sad... Very sad.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.625
Pathetic, really.
Sir.

20:22.709 --> 20:25.083
I-I miss fighting, okay,
General Kelly?

20:25.166 --> 20:26.500
You wouldn't understand.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.250
Just reinstate the
press's credentials,

20:28.333 --> 20:29.500
and they'll be back.

20:29.583 --> 20:30.625
I don't know.
The press is prickly.

20:30.709 --> 20:34.000
You can't just lay out
some peanut butter and 6 bucks

20:34.083 --> 20:35.458
and expect them
to come back.

20:35.542 --> 20:37.583
Sir, do you know how badly
the media needs you?

20:37.667 --> 20:40.750
Do you think President Jeb Bush
would've inspired viewers

20:40.834 --> 20:44.125
to compulsively consume news out
of fear for the Earth's fate?

20:44.208 --> 20:46.625
- Do you mean it?
- Of course I do.

20:46.709 --> 20:48.291
I'm constantly
checking Twitter

20:48.375 --> 20:51.125
to see if I'm about to be
promoted, fired, or vaporized.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.834
All right.
I've got an idea.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.000
Lamp, sorry about before.
I'm gonna need you on this.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.458
Melania,
I know you're scared

20:58.542 --> 21:00.750
of killing your face
and thoughts,

21:00.834 --> 21:02.959
but keep in mind
that it's helped me

21:03.041 --> 21:05.333
and so many Washington types
reach their goals.

21:05.417 --> 21:08.875
You know, not to brag,
but the other day,

21:08.959 --> 21:10.875
I gave a speech
to a stainless-steel wall.

21:10.959 --> 21:12.417
And I killed an entire

21:12.500 --> 21:16.000
healthcare program
for impoverished children

21:16.083 --> 21:18.083
while wearing
the facial expression

21:18.166 --> 21:20.458
of a man going
produce shopping.

21:20.542 --> 21:23.166
But your goals
are not my goals.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.000
I miss being alive,

21:25.083 --> 21:28.625
being expressive,
being human. Mm.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.333
If that's the case,

21:30.417 --> 21:33.500
you should know that
it's not too late for you.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.125
Really?
What do you mean?

21:35.208 --> 21:38.208
I don't know for sure,
but legend has it

21:38.291 --> 21:40.250
that with just
the right stimulus

21:40.333 --> 21:42.542
at exactly the right time,

21:42.625 --> 21:46.542
or if your husband says
something completely bat-shit,

21:46.625 --> 21:49.083
your face will resurrect.

21:49.166 --> 21:52.542
Holy shit. That thing
is really stuck there.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.709
Don,
I'm sorry I blew up back there,

21:54.792 --> 21:57.500
but a guy's allowed to
fly off the handle
once in his life, right?

21:57.583 --> 21:58.834
Dude, we're good.
I'm no angel, either.

21:58.917 --> 22:04.166
Just ask the Punta Cana Highway
Patrol, years 1995 through 2013.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.208
So, you really want me to
tell the mainstream media

22:06.291 --> 22:08.458
that you're releasing
your tax returns?

22:08.542 --> 22:09.792
It's the only surefire way

22:09.875 --> 22:11.166
to get them back
to the White House.

22:11.250 --> 22:14.542
For the last time, it's the
spineless American media.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.041
They'll come back.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.083
Quiet, Kelly.

22:17.166 --> 22:18.583
Mr. Phonedialer
needs to concentrate.

22:18.667 --> 22:22.583
CNN tip line.
How can I help you?

22:22.667 --> 22:24.959
Hello.
My name is Joey Ringring.

22:25.041 --> 22:29.667
I work at the White House,
and I got the tip of a lifetime.

22:29.750 --> 22:33.166
Donald, remember...

22:33.250 --> 22:38.250
You must say the biggest whopper
of a lie you've ever said.

22:38.333 --> 22:39.458
Hey, I don't
choose to lie.

22:39.542 --> 22:42.583
I mean, does the ocean
choose its tides?

22:44.709 --> 22:46.834
Wow. This is nice, right?
Are we loving it?

22:46.917 --> 22:49.333
It's great to have
the mainstream media back.

22:49.417 --> 22:52.417
You've heard reports that
my tax returns will soon leak.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.125
Guess what...
We planted that story

22:55.208 --> 22:57.125
to trick you
into coming here!

22:57.208 --> 22:58.959
- What the hell?!
- Darn!

22:59.041 --> 23:02.458
Wait! Stop!
I did that for good reason.

23:02.542 --> 23:05.000
I thought I wanted a nice,
princely press corps,

23:05.083 --> 23:06.959
the kind you can introduce
to your parents.

23:07.041 --> 23:10.000
But when I got it, I-I just
longed for the bad-boy media.

23:10.083 --> 23:11.834
So, here it goes.

23:11.917 --> 23:14.625
I love you people.

23:14.709 --> 23:17.709
I want to fight again.
Makes me feel alive.

23:17.792 --> 23:19.709
And I think
it makes you feel alive, too.

23:19.792 --> 23:21.291
So go ahead... confront me.

23:21.375 --> 23:23.667
Ask me why Melania
rolls her eyes.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.041
Come on!
I love every second of it.

23:25.125 --> 23:27.208
So, what do you say?

23:27.291 --> 23:30.625
Want to jump on this crazy train
for one more ride?

23:30.709 --> 23:33.291
You can't just blow
us off and expect us
to come right back.

23:33.375 --> 23:34.458
- Yes, I can.
- All right, fine.

23:34.542 --> 23:37.834
You claim your budget plan
is revenue-neutral,

23:37.917 --> 23:39.834
but the CBO says
that's not true.

23:39.917 --> 23:41.041
Well, guess what, folks.

23:41.125 --> 23:44.166
We know what that is...
Fake news!

23:44.250 --> 23:46.500
- I did miss this.
- That's our guy.

23:46.583 --> 23:49.417
So, you... you brought your
face back from the dead, huh?

23:49.500 --> 23:51.500
Yes. I guess I did.

23:51.583 --> 23:54.125
All right. Well, I guess
I'll see you around.

23:54.208 --> 23:57.291
Sarah, I'm sorry
about what I said.

23:57.375 --> 23:59.500
I know you were just
trying to help.

23:59.583 --> 24:00.834
Thank you, Melania.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.083
You've given me a lot
to think about.

24:03.166 --> 24:07.166
Maybe one day, I'll try
to revive my face, too.

24:07.250 --> 24:08.667
That would be great.

24:08.750 --> 24:09.500
Oh, and if you ever want

24:09.583 --> 24:12.458
to write that screenplay,
let me know.

24:12.542 --> 24:14.250
That's a great idea!

24:14.333 --> 24:16.208
What if the face
was alive the whole time

24:16.291 --> 24:18.000
and it worked
at a coffee shop

24:18.083 --> 24:20.125
with a lot of other really
cool and hip millennials?

24:20.208 --> 24:22.667
Ahh.

24:22.750 --> 24:25.959
Melania, I'm so glad you're back
with your beautiful emotions,

24:26.041 --> 24:29.875
proud of me, grateful to me,
overcome with longing for me.

24:29.959 --> 24:32.166
And I cherish
your eye-rolls.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.792
Thanks for
saying that, Donald.

24:33.875 --> 24:34.875
So, are you
going to apologize

24:34.959 --> 24:38.583
for setting me up with
Sarah Huckabee Sanders?

24:38.667 --> 24:40.875
You're the one who said
you wanted media training.

24:40.959 --> 24:43.375
Uh, yes, I said I wanted
to train my face,

24:43.458 --> 24:45.375
not to kill it
completely.

24:45.458 --> 24:46.291
You know what they say...
You can't make an omelet

24:46.375 --> 24:48.041
without killing
a few chickens.

24:48.125 --> 24:50.542
Speaking of...

24:50.625 --> 24:53.375
Ugh. I said
no chicken in bed.

24:53.458 --> 24:57.166
Chicken broth is not
chicken. How many times
do I have to say it?!

24:57.250 --> 24:58.792
Donald,
chew more slowly.

24:58.875 --> 25:00.041
You're splashing chicken blood
on my nightgown.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.583
Oops. Hold still.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.291
I'll find a dress
to mop it up with.
