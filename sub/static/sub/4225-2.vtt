WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:04.049
What happened to the pub
is Irish business?

00:04.640 --> 00:08.247
You shut your gypsy mouth
and listen to your instructions.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.931
Eamonn Duggan?

00:11.880 --> 00:12.881
My son and my daughter

00:12.960 --> 00:15.770
were taken from me
when they were very small.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.604
<i>We're planning an expansion.</i>

00:17.680 --> 00:19.284
<i>I'm taking premises in London.</i>

00:19.360 --> 00:22.284
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs
have been at war in London.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.806
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.564
<i>We take the opportunity
to show our hand.</i>

00:29.880 --> 00:31.325
That arrived an hour ago.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.721
There's no name on it
but it comes from Camden Town.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.484
Well done, Tommy.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.005
Now you're at war with Sabini.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.560
- Ada Shelby?
-No.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.251
Your brother broke the rules.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.007
Sabini.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.209
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.329
See if
the bastard's still alive.

00:55.520 --> 01:05.529
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

01:54.480 --> 01:55.686
No! No!

01:55.760 --> 01:58.001
It's all right, Miss Shelby.
We work with Tommy.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.684
We're Peaky Blinders.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.966
My name is not Shelby!

02:21.800 --> 02:23.723
Ready for a visitor, Mr Shelby?

02:24.320 --> 02:25.401
No.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.689
I'm here on the King's orders.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.684
I'm afraid I must insist.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.321
Ah.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.602
You paid extra for daylight.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.325
The racketeering business
must be booming.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.291
Are you not going to thank me
for saving your life?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.080
Pass me cigarettes?

03:07.080 --> 03:08.730
Three nights ago,

03:09.720 --> 03:12.246
at the co-operative stables
in Montague Street,

03:12.840 --> 03:14.524
there was a murder.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.841
A man named Duggan.

03:18.720 --> 03:23.931
The Oxfordshire constabulary
found his body in a shallow grave.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.125
I need to piss.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.447
Nurse?

03:30.600 --> 03:35.208
I know it was you who carried out
the murder of Mr Duggan.

03:52.520 --> 03:55.330
Oh, by the way.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.244
Grace, she went to New York.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.164
A place called, er...

04:03.800 --> 04:05.245
Poughkeepsie.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.685
She's married now.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.763
To a banker. He's rich.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.810
I'm sure she's very happy.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.730
You have been under my microscope
for some weeks now.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.201
I have been observing
every move you make.

04:21.279 --> 04:24.966
And that is why I was on hand
to save your life.

04:26.160 --> 04:31.644
I imagine being shot by a woman
hurts the same as being shot by a man.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.129
Just a bit more shameful.

04:35.960 --> 04:40.966
You know, Mr Campbell,
when I got shot they gave me a medal.

04:41.800 --> 04:42.847
Yeah.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.731
No medal for you I bet.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.891
Mr Shelby,

04:50.440 --> 04:51.487
our reunion...

04:54.120 --> 04:57.124
...is part of a very carefully
worked out plan,

04:57.200 --> 05:00.044
which has been in place
for some time now.

05:00.960 --> 05:05.090
Every time you lean on that stick
I bet you see her face.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.482
And as a result of the information
in my possession,

05:09.560 --> 05:11.927
I can charge you with murder at any time

05:12.000 --> 05:14.970
and provide
two impeccable Crown witnesses

05:15.280 --> 05:19.604
whose testimony will lead you
directly to the gallows.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.761
You are on my hook, Mr Shelby.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.845
And from this moment forward...

05:29.200 --> 05:30.929
...you belong to me.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.045
So, get well quickly.

05:37.240 --> 05:40.801
I'll be in touch the moment I hear
you can piss standing up.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.322
Then I will send you your instructions.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.006
Curly, you left the gate open?

06:01.080 --> 06:03.651
No, I locked it.
I pinched myself when I did it.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.842
- Get that stuff under cover.
-Yeah.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.206
Hey!

06:09.440 --> 06:10.726
Who goes there?

06:16.040 --> 06:17.087
Tommy?

06:17.440 --> 06:20.842
Curly, get that oil you put on the legs
when they go lame.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.570
Are you fucking mad, Doyle?

06:22.640 --> 06:24.290
The yellow stuff. Go on.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.367
They said you'd be in for
another three weeks.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.442
I need to get on a boat to London.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.000
Tonight.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.046
You discharged yourself?

06:37.120 --> 06:39.361
I'm a fucking
sitting duck in there, Charlie.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.851
Sabini could send a man at any time.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.206
I need to get some things done.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.281
You're burning up.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.286
Here.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.170
Oh, Tommy! That stuff's
for rubbing into fucking horses.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.720
Ha! I am a horse.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.691
If you were a horse, they'd shoot you
with this many broken bones.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.521
Get the black powder, Curly.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.726
- Go.
-Yeah.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.246
The black powder.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.844
You pay for a bloody hospital
and you're using witchcraft?

07:06.120 --> 07:09.124
I need to sleep in the open air
and feel the boat under me, Charlie.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.131
Oh, Tommy.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.445
You're just like your mother.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.885
Do you have a boat here?

07:16.560 --> 07:18.483
Only the <i>January.</i> She's heavy.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.365
London will take four days.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.488
That'll do. Can you spare Curly?

07:23.560 --> 07:25.085
He'll be my doctor.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.885
Then God help you.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.371
You have tobacco, Curly?

07:29.440 --> 07:30.441
And tea and whisky.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.562
We'll have you running around
like a colt.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.722
Ah, get him aboard. I'll fill her up.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.090
If I sleep all the way,
it's Camden Town we're heading for.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.401
What business do you have
in Camden Town, Tommy?

07:41.480 --> 07:43.562
Tell Polly she's in charge
while I'm away.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.607
If I don't come back,
tell her she's in charge for good.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.090
You hungry yet, Tommy?

09:25.400 --> 09:26.811
You know what, Curly?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.845
I think I am.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.087
Where are we?

09:31.160 --> 09:33.970
Uh, Heathrow.
One more day and we'll be there.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.769
I'll put something in the pan.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.001
Can you steer?

09:37.560 --> 09:38.766
Give it a go.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.202
You're almost there, too, Tommy.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.490
Fucking hell, lads. Calm down.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.525
Put him down, Ollie.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.082
Put him down, mate. He's only little.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.366
You on your own?

10:34.840 --> 10:35.921
Seems so.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.445
Well, you're a brave lad, ain't you?

10:37.520 --> 10:39.363
You want to take a look at my bakery?

10:40.920 --> 10:43.491
We bake all sorts here mate, yeah.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.530
Did you know we bake over
10,000 loaves a week?

10:46.600 --> 10:47.931
Can you believe it?

10:48.360 --> 10:52.126
We bake the white bread,
we bake the brown bread.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.965
We bake all sorts.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.965
Would you like to try some?

10:59.680 --> 11:00.841
Bread?

11:01.880 --> 11:02.961
Yeah?

11:03.640 --> 11:04.880
All right.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.769
What would you like, brown or white?

11:08.320 --> 11:09.401
Try the brown.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.845
Brown, right.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.160
Not bad.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.685
Not bad, eh?

11:27.360 --> 11:28.521
Not bad?

11:30.920 --> 11:32.649
It's fucking awful, that stuff.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.691
The fucking brown stuff
is horrible, it's for the workers.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.807
Yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.321
The white stuff,
now that is for the bosses.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.000
Come look.

11:44.640 --> 11:49.282
Well, I've heard
very bad, bad, bad things

11:49.360 --> 11:51.601
about you Birmingham people.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.045
You're gypsies, right?

11:57.640 --> 12:00.211
So what, do you live in
a fucking tent or a caravan?

12:00.960 --> 12:03.122
I came here to discuss business...

12:03.200 --> 12:04.725
...with you, Mr Solomons.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.521
Well, rum's for fun and fucking, innit?

12:08.600 --> 12:11.001
So, whisky, now that...

12:11.080 --> 12:12.525
That is for business.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.050
Let's talk first, eh?

12:20.120 --> 12:21.360
Suit yourself.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.724
They say you had your life
saved by a policeman.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.564
I have policemen on my payroll.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.005
Well, I don't like policemen

12:30.080 --> 12:32.845
because policemen,
they can't be trusted.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.490
Mr Sabini uses policemen all the time.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.449
That's why he's winning
the war in London

12:39.080 --> 12:40.491
and you are losing it.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.562
A war ain't over until it's over, mate.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.805
You were in the war?

12:51.720 --> 12:57.124
I once carried out my own
personal form of stigmata on an Italian.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.566
I pushed his face up against the trench

13:01.640 --> 13:04.211
and shoved a six-inch nail
up his fucking nose

13:04.280 --> 13:06.282
and I hammered it home
with a duck board.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.522
It was fucking biblical, mate.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.970
So don't come in here and sit there
in my chair and tell me

13:15.040 --> 13:18.044
that I'm losing my war to a fucking wop.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.803
That war was a long time ago.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.565
You need to be more realistic.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.171
Realistic, yeah?

13:29.120 --> 13:30.121
Realistic?

13:31.720 --> 13:32.960
Well, if you weren't losing the war,

13:33.040 --> 13:35.042
then you wouldn't have
sent me the telegram.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.360
Really?

13:36.440 --> 13:39.444
You forget your fucking telegram.
The telegram just said, "Hello."

13:40.200 --> 13:43.249
Very simple,
you want to sell me something.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.207
What?

13:46.760 --> 13:48.922
- We join forces.
-Fuck off.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.963
No! Categorical.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.487
Fucking ridiculous.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.365
Mr Solomons.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.528
Your distillery provides
one-tenth of your income.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.328
Protection is another 10%.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.687
And the rest you make
from the race tracks.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.571
I know you keep a gun in the drawer.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.130
I know you keep it beside the whisky.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.806
I know you offer a deal or death.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.921
I know what I'm saying makes you angry.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.282
But I am offering you a solution.

14:24.640 --> 14:29.328
You see, Mr Sabini is running
all your bookies off your courses.

14:30.760 --> 14:34.207
And he is closing down the premises
that take your rum.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.601
And people don't trust
your protection any more.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.922
You're the bloke
who shot Billy Kimber, right?

14:44.320 --> 14:46.448
You did, you fucking shot him.
That's you.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.842
You fucking betrayed him, mate.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.251
So it'd be entirely appropriate

14:51.320 --> 14:54.244
to do what I am thinking
in my head to you right now.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.006
I can offer you 100 good men.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.845
All with weapons.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.449
And a new relationship with the police.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.691
Intelligence.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.810
Intelligence is a very valuable thing,
innit, my friend?

15:09.880 --> 15:12.645
And usually it comes
far too fucking late.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.644
Let's say that
I shot you already, right,

15:17.720 --> 15:19.449
in the fucking face.

15:20.840 --> 15:24.322
And the bullet goes bone, mush,
bone, cabinet over there.

15:24.880 --> 15:25.881
Which is a shame, innit,

15:25.960 --> 15:28.691
'cause that cabinet's fucked now
and I got to get shot of it.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.527
- So, what I'd do is this...

15:33.200 --> 15:34.611
It's fucking simple, mate.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.610
I cut that cabinet in half, don't I?

15:44.960 --> 15:47.770
I do. I just literally...
I cut the cabinet... I cut...

15:51.320 --> 15:54.449
I cut the cabinet
literally in half, mate.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.966
And I take one half
of the cabinet, all right,

15:57.040 --> 15:58.849
and I put it into a barrel

15:58.920 --> 16:01.446
and I take the other half of the cabinet
and all its pieces

16:01.520 --> 16:03.170
and I put that
into another barrel, right?

16:03.520 --> 16:06.967
And I send this barrel off to Mandalay.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.646
And the other barrel
off to somewhere like...

16:09.720 --> 16:11.165
I don't know...

16:12.520 --> 16:13.806
Timbuktu.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.602
- You ever been?
-No.

16:16.680 --> 16:17.727
No?

16:19.080 --> 16:20.605
Would you like to go?

16:22.320 --> 16:23.401
No.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.847
You know, I always thought that

16:26.920 --> 16:29.446
you'd have a great big
fucking gold ring in your nose.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.650
I'm sorry, go on.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.045
Tell us your plan.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.401
Ada.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.484
How the fuck did you find me?

16:57.560 --> 16:59.324
What, are you reading Polly's letters?

16:59.400 --> 17:00.481
Polly showed me the letter.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.609
Look, you think you're safe
because you moved flat, but you're not.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.727
Polly thinks the same.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.804
When will you understand?
I just want you all out of my life.

17:07.880 --> 17:08.926
Ada.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.888
Look at us, eh?

17:11.920 --> 17:13.330
And it'll happen again.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.925
Yeah, well, next time I'll be ready.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.685
In fact, I want them to try again
'cause I'll shoot their balls off!

17:17.760 --> 17:20.080
- Ada, put the fucking gun away.
-Get away from me, I'm late for work.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.560
All right, fine. Fine.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.080
Just take this.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.161
Take it.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.766
Where you're living now is right
on the edge of Sabini's territory

17:30.840 --> 17:32.968
and all the coppers round there
work for him.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.884
I've got a lot of money coming in
that I can't put through the banks.

17:35.960 --> 17:38.486
My accountant says the best thing
is to buy property for cash

17:38.560 --> 17:40.403
and put it in the name
of a family member.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.201
A house? A whole house?

17:45.800 --> 17:46.961
It's all yours.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.922
Four storeys, eight bedrooms,

17:50.880 --> 17:52.644
kitchen, scullery.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.124
Rooms for a maid,
if your political conscience will allow.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.210
At least go and have a look, eh?

18:25.640 --> 18:27.608
Shoot the fucking lot of them.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.527
Mr Sabini?
The police are here.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.565
Tell them to wipe their feet.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.002
So why do I have to tell you everything?

18:53.440 --> 18:55.966
We can't search every train
that comes into London.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.131
They don't use trains, they use boats.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.483
The boatmen are all gypsies.
He's a fucking gypsy.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.611
Why do we have to tell them everything?

19:05.880 --> 19:07.723
Okay, we can't search every boat.

19:11.840 --> 19:16.289
Lucky for me,
I have a boy in the Jews' rum house.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.922
The gypsy went to meet Solomons.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.925
And after, they drank
whisky and shook hands.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.764
And then Alfie gave him some salt

19:24.840 --> 19:28.561
or some such kike thing
that means peace.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.570
What exactly d'you want us to do,
Mr Sabini?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.681
Did you bring dog shit
in here on your shoes?

19:47.200 --> 19:48.361
Check, have a look.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.089
I can smell something.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.561
You've got photographs
of this Tommy Shelby, though, right?

19:54.720 --> 19:56.449
We have military ID photographs

19:56.520 --> 19:58.887
from his time
with the Warwickshire Yeomanry.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.246
Shelby won medals.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.127
Okay, so you've got his fucking photo.

20:17.040 --> 20:21.921
If he shows his face in Camden Town,
your coppers lift him. All right?

20:23.360 --> 20:24.646
You know...

20:25.280 --> 20:29.080
Sometimes when I smell something,
it's something that's not real,

20:29.160 --> 20:32.562
it's something more like a...
Like a premonition.

20:33.240 --> 20:38.007
It's like sometimes I smell something,
but it's not a smell, it's just...

20:39.240 --> 20:40.685
...something isn't right.

20:40.760 --> 20:44.003
Mr Sabini, we'll do everything
we can to deal with this man.

20:45.480 --> 20:46.606
Deal?

20:49.000 --> 20:50.206
Did you say, "Do a deal"?

20:51.520 --> 20:52.806
I didn't mean that.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.446
Fuck.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.766
Fuck.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.206
- You've been fucking got at.
-No, you're being ridiculous.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.009
Somebody's fucking sat you down.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.880
Somebody's fucking sat you down
and talked to you!

21:09.200 --> 21:10.645
- Mr Sabini...
-We should go.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.202
This fucking gypsy has sat down
with the fucking coppers!

21:14.280 --> 21:15.281
Mr Sabini.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.963
and you're taking with
both fucking hands

21:19.040 --> 21:20.769
off of me and off of him!

21:22.920 --> 21:26.561
Okay, so now you fucking follow Shelby.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.769
You fucking follow him
and you finish him!

21:47.160 --> 21:48.924
Oh, shit.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.606
I told youse, boys, 'ere she is.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.809
What the bloody hell is going on?

22:30.440 --> 22:31.965
When did you get back?

22:32.800 --> 22:34.643
I didn't want to miss
your birthday, Pol.

22:35.680 --> 22:36.727
Back to work.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.087
How d'you know it's my birthday?
Nobody ever knows.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.731
Ah, it's different this year.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.007
John, Finn, bring the car round.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.081
Where are we going?

22:45.160 --> 22:46.924
To unwrap your birthday present.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.286
After you.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.326
Good morning!

23:12.400 --> 23:14.402
You said you were gonna buy Ada a house.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.009
Yep, that's right, I did.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.329
Just had a bit of cash left over.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.611
This is ours?

23:25.240 --> 23:26.651
No, Polly...

23:27.600 --> 23:28.601
This is yours.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.610
'Cause you deserve it.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.170
What would I do with all these rooms?

23:46.720 --> 23:50.520
Well, you could, uh, relax for one.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.490
Come here at weekends.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.721
It has a garden, eh?

23:59.400 --> 24:01.050
You love gardens.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.685
You can grow roses, Pol.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.610
I don't know, have a piano.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.291
Have people round,
they can have a singsong, eh?

24:08.360 --> 24:10.124
God help the bloody neighbours.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.247
Fuck the neighbours.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.205
Welcome home, Pol.

24:29.520 --> 24:32.046
Arthur, why don't you
take the boys outside,

24:32.120 --> 24:33.326
wait by the car?

24:44.600 --> 24:45.726
Pol...

24:47.480 --> 24:49.847
I know you haven't
been happy for a while.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.925
And I know why.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.529
Esme is all right, you know?

25:04.960 --> 25:07.281
She's got a good heart, she has.

25:09.920 --> 25:13.686
I've spoken to her and she told me.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.200
Told you what?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.731
She told me what it is
that would make you happy.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.601
I've spoken to our contacts
in the police.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.160
They have contacts in the council,

25:32.240 --> 25:35.289
and they have contacts with the people
who keep the parish records.

25:37.320 --> 25:42.326
Records of adoptions,
and of confidential forced removals.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.204
Now, with your permission,

25:46.320 --> 25:47.924
I'd like to grease a few palms

25:48.680 --> 25:51.081
and take a look at the records
they never showed you.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.401
Pol...

25:58.280 --> 26:02.251
I am going to find your son and daughter
and I'm gonna bring them home.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.889
That's what this house is for.

26:04.960 --> 26:08.567
So that you can bring your family home
where they belong.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.685
We're moving up, Pol.

26:48.160 --> 26:49.650
Go have a look what you think.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.605
Can you hear that?

26:59.920 --> 27:01.490
Silence at last.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.407
- And it belongs to us.

27:08.200 --> 27:10.282
Mummy, there's loads of chairs!

27:11.040 --> 27:12.280
What's in there?

27:43.840 --> 27:45.205
Still here?

27:45.440 --> 27:47.920
Well, there's a lot coming in
and a lot going out.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.369
Well, as long as there's more coming in,
we're all right.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.130
This came for you today.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.161
It's all the way from America, New York.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.890
Somewhere called Poughkeepsie?

28:00.520 --> 28:03.091
And the decorators doing The Garrison
want paying.

28:03.320 --> 28:06.130
Arthur forgot and pulled a gun
when they asked, so...

28:06.200 --> 28:09.249
- They've stopped and everything's green.
-All right, well, just pay it.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.527
Oh, and we need to put
an advert in the <i>Mail,</i>

28:12.120 --> 28:14.521
Grand Reopening."

28:14.760 --> 28:16.922
Oh, and you said there's a letter
that had to go today.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.570
Special delivery.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.165
I wrote it in the diary.

28:20.720 --> 28:24.088
Yes, I haven't written it out yet.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.447
Well, you can just tell me
and I'll write it down.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.726
I've learnt shorthand.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.450
Fair enough.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.810
Dear Mr Churchill...

28:39.360 --> 28:40.964
Has your pencil broken?

28:42.600 --> 28:45.604
No. No, do go on.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.091
Dear Mr Churchill...

28:48.600 --> 28:52.764
I've been approached
by an agent of the Crown

28:52.840 --> 28:56.606
to carry out a task, as yet unspecified.

28:57.880 --> 29:01.851
<i>"His name is Major Campbell
and I believe he reports to you.</i>

29:03.520 --> 29:07.286
<i>"Therefore, I decided to make
direct contact with you</i>

29:07.360 --> 29:10.409
<i>"to make sure that certain things
are clearly understood."</i>

29:11.520 --> 29:15.411
<i>"Mr Churchill, you should know that
I am a former British soldier</i>

29:15.480 --> 29:17.289
<i>"and if you look at my war record,</i>

29:17.360 --> 29:21.081
<i>"you will see that I fought bravely
at Verdun and at the Somme.</i>

29:21.160 --> 29:23.845
"Also, you will see
that my actions at Mons

29:23.920 --> 29:26.321
"saved thousands of Allied lives.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.889
"I know that you resigned
your ministerial position

29:29.960 --> 29:31.371
"and the safety of an office

29:31.440 --> 29:34.364
"to go and fight on the front line
with the men.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.569
"I read that you fought bravely,
Mr Churchill.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.608
"Therefore, I hope I will be treated

29:39.680 --> 29:42.286
"in any dealings we have
with a degree of respect,

29:42.960 --> 29:44.485
"soldier to soldier.

29:45.280 --> 29:49.126
"My demands are slight and my sacrifice
in service of my country

29:49.240 --> 29:51.846
"will no doubt once again be great.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.931
"Yours sincerely, Thomas Shelby."

29:56.400 --> 29:59.882
Military Medal and the DCM.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.808
Distinguished Conduct Medal.

30:05.320 --> 30:08.688
Hands up in this room,
those who were at the Somme.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.206
Those who were at the Battle of Verdun?

30:19.280 --> 30:21.760
Thomas Shelby was a tunneller.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.450
His demand is rather amusing.

30:27.040 --> 30:31.648
He has asked that the Colonial Office
grant him an Empire export licence.

30:32.840 --> 30:35.969
And specifically a licence
covering India,

30:36.040 --> 30:39.044
Malay Peninsula, Canada and Russia.

30:39.120 --> 30:42.727
He plans to transport
certain manufactured goods

30:42.800 --> 30:45.007
from Birmingham to the Poplar Docks.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.401
And you plan to agree to this demand?

30:47.480 --> 30:51.166
Dear God, Major Campbell...

30:52.560 --> 30:57.726
We will be asking this man to carry out
an assassination on behalf of the Crown,

30:58.120 --> 31:00.600
once more risking his life.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.004
These demands
by comparison are slight

31:04.080 --> 31:07.527
and easily met
with a few quiet words over lunch

31:07.600 --> 31:09.204
with the appropriate ministers.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.682
Sir, with the greatest respect,

31:13.040 --> 31:15.520
Thomas Shelby is a murdering,

31:16.280 --> 31:19.489
cut-throat, mongrel, gangster.

31:20.720 --> 31:25.282
And yet, the tunnels were dug
beneath our feet

31:25.360 --> 31:28.489
to silence the guns
pointed at our heads.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.927
Get Thomas Shelby's
details from Campbell

31:34.000 --> 31:37.800
and get some kind of royal
appointment stamp.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.166
Temporary.

31:39.640 --> 31:40.641
Temporary?

31:40.720 --> 31:43.405
Just until the deed is done.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.607
Agreed, Major Campbell?

31:46.680 --> 31:49.650
And then I can proceed as discussed?

31:52.800 --> 31:54.211
Ag reed, sir.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.250
Come on, let's go inside.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.325
Here, pass the ball!

32:17.720 --> 32:18.960
Come on.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.646
Come on in, boys.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.241
Did you have a good game?

32:23.320 --> 32:24.845
I'm starving,
have you done anything for lunch?

32:24.920 --> 32:26.445
It'll be
on in a minute, in you go.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.648
Go in and wash your hands, boys,
all right?

32:28.920 --> 32:30.160
Come on, mister.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.091
Mrs Johnson?

32:32.920 --> 32:35.321
Yes. Who are you?

32:36.320 --> 32:39.130
I'm from Birmingham Council,
Bordesley parish.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.520
No-one wrote to me. What d'you want?

32:43.280 --> 32:46.170
I would like to talk about your son,
about Henry.

32:46.480 --> 32:47.720
Can I come in?

32:47.800 --> 32:50.451
Oh, I'd rather you didn't,
he doesn't like to talk about this.

32:51.560 --> 32:52.766
I see.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.490
So what does Henry know
about his real identity, Mrs Johnson?

32:58.800 --> 33:02.725
I only deal with Mr Ross from the agency
and he only ever writes, so...

33:03.080 --> 33:04.366
Why are you here in person?

33:04.720 --> 33:06.961
Well, the boy is approaching
his 18th birthday.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.411
This isn't right!

33:10.600 --> 33:12.921
You're not from the council,
something isn't right.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.287
Hmm. What does he know, Mrs Johnson?

33:18.320 --> 33:19.845
He knows his mother couldn't cope.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.326
She drank too much, she used opium.

33:24.120 --> 33:25.451
She used to beat him.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.486
But that isn't the truth, is it?

33:27.680 --> 33:30.445
Look, I think you should come back
when my husband's here.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.410
Does he know what his real name is?

33:32.480 --> 33:35.689
His real name is Johnson, Henry Johnson,

33:35.760 --> 33:39.162
now I would like you to go away
and come back when my husband's here.

33:39.680 --> 33:43.605
The truth is, he was taken
from his mother without her permission.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.648
Henry, go back inside, please.

33:45.720 --> 33:46.767
Who are you?

33:46.840 --> 33:48.444
Please, Henry, go on!

33:48.520 --> 33:50.522
- Your real name is Michael Gray.
-No!

33:50.600 --> 33:52.364
Your real mother wants to see you.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.487
Her address is on the back of this card.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.367
She just wants to talk.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.283
- Go away.
-She just wants to talk.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.885
Go away and leave us alone.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.360
Go away!

34:05.360 --> 34:06.964
Come on, let's go back inside.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.089
Come on, I'll get you something to eat.

34:10.239 --> 34:11.650
Come on, Henry.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.248
Come on. Come on.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.487
Call yourself a Shelby?

34:19.040 --> 34:20.041
Fucking hit him, Finn.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.844
Hit him, that's right.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.005
All right, Isiah, your turn.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.362
Finn! Call yourself a Shelby?
Fucking hit him, for fuck's sake!

34:31.560 --> 34:32.800
Hit him.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.647
Get him out of there, get him back!

34:40.719 --> 34:42.484
- Get him back!
-Arthur, for fuck's sake!

34:42.560 --> 34:43.846
Get him out of there!

35:01.600 --> 35:03.728
Rockfair is down to sixes.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.081
Right, what happened?

35:42.440 --> 35:43.726
It was a fair fight.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.686
Yeah.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.603
Arthur just caught him with a good 'un.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.365
I saw the body, don't fucking lie to me.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.408
I saw the body, what fucking happened?

35:58.120 --> 36:00.805
I'm not family, I'm saying nothing.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.041
Arthur...

36:08.400 --> 36:10.289
He's blown a few times lately.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.963
Six, seven.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.088
It's like he's not there in the head.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.011
He can't even hear "stop".

36:19.640 --> 36:20.971
Even his own name.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.925
And then he cries.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.041
Right, listen to me.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.249
That's two fucking stories.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.887
Your brother killed a boy.

36:39.960 --> 36:42.281
There were witnesses,
there will be questions,

36:43.000 --> 36:45.367
get your story straight,
it was an accident.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.041
Fuck off.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.606
I spoke to the doctor,

36:55.680 --> 36:58.729
he said the kid
probably had a weak heart.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.165
We'll look after his mother.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.926
It'll be fine.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.487
Polly said I should have stuck
with the medicine.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.088
I said that you know best.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.248
It's like a fucking boat, Tommy.

37:20.440 --> 37:23.046
Full of heavy cargo, like coal or iron.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.928
Sometimes it slips to one end.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.085
And the boat tips.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.210
I can feel it slipping.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.207
And I can feel the boat tipping.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.963
But there ain't nothing
I can do about it.

37:46.120 --> 37:51.650
It's like me fuckin' head’s just like
this fuckin' black fucking barge!

37:52.600 --> 37:56.241
And it just fucking drifts

37:56.320 --> 37:59.529
in and out, in and out.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.001
Well, we're home
a long time now, Arthur.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.005
We're home a long time.

38:07.520 --> 38:09.761
- I thought you were all right.
-Yeah, well...

38:10.960 --> 38:15.170
I, I, I don't think I am, Tommy.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.560
Take this fucking thing away from me.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.085
Just fuck off, Arthur.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.201
You know what?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.286
I've had enough.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.644
I've fucking had enough.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.883
Just fuck off!

38:44.480 --> 38:45.481
What?

38:46.040 --> 38:48.725
I'm supposed to treat you
like a fucking kid again, eh?

38:49.960 --> 38:53.601
Keep you away from guns
and fucking rope, is that it?

38:54.560 --> 38:56.403
You think
I haven't got enough on!

38:56.480 --> 38:57.641
- Stop it, Tommy.
-Arthur?

38:57.720 --> 38:59.609
You think I haven't got enough on?

38:59.680 --> 39:01.603
- Stop it.
-The war is done!

39:01.680 --> 39:03.330
- Shut the door on it!
-Stop it.

39:03.400 --> 39:06.210
Shut the door on it like I did, eh?

39:06.280 --> 39:07.805
- Can you do that?
-Yeah?

39:07.880 --> 39:09.041
- Like I fucking did.
-I'm not fucking you.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.203
- Shut the fucking door, eh?
-But I'm not fucking you!

39:12.280 --> 39:15.090
I am not fucking you!

39:15.160 --> 39:17.242
Everyone fucking knows it!

39:19.400 --> 39:20.606
God!

39:23.720 --> 39:25.563
Look at yourself. Eh?

39:26.920 --> 39:29.048
Look at yourself.

39:31.520 --> 39:35.923
Take a long, hard,
fucking look at yourself.

40:24.480 --> 40:25.481
Time for lunch, sir.

40:25.560 --> 40:29.201
I thought we could eat at the desk,
like the old days.

40:35.880 --> 40:37.370
You remembered.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.205
Tongue and pickle, sir.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.162
But it's the single stroke
of mustard, that's the thing.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.561
- Hmm.
-The fine detail.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.925
Speaking of detail...

40:51.480 --> 40:56.407
How much is Thomas Shelby
paying you in bribes per week?

40:56.480 --> 40:57.481
Hmm?

41:01.160 --> 41:03.003
Actually, I already know.

41:03.120 --> 41:07.967
Two pounds a week, eight pounds a month,
plus extras for specific favours.

41:09.240 --> 41:12.244
When I left, you were an honest man.

41:12.320 --> 41:15.688
And now you're on
the Peaky Blinders' payroll.

41:18.640 --> 41:24.010
Shelby is a worm and feeds off
the rotten parts of your mind.

41:24.080 --> 41:27.687
He gets in through your ear,
with a whisper.

41:27.760 --> 41:33.005
He crawls in over your tongue as you
lie to the judge and the pastor.

41:34.640 --> 41:35.641
Mr Moss...

41:37.360 --> 41:41.365
We are entering a bloody phase
of a bloody war

41:41.440 --> 41:43.568
with no quarter asked or given.

41:45.320 --> 41:50.963
But as of this moment, you are now
back on the side of the angels.

41:52.720 --> 41:57.886
Shelby thinks you work for him,
but in truth, you work for me.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.963
And I will use you mercilessly.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.690
Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.605
As you can see, one is white...

42:59.720 --> 43:01.165
...and one is black.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.884
What you saw in your dreams...

43:09.080 --> 43:10.320
...was right.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.645
Your daughter is dead.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.441
Um... You do it, I can't read it.

43:34.840 --> 43:37.969
After Anna was taken from you,
she was put with a...

43:39.240 --> 43:42.369
With a family of a
railway station master in Stafford.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.287
She never settled.

43:48.440 --> 43:50.442
So she kept running away.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.448
She got on a train to Birmingham once...

43:56.960 --> 43:59.531
Eventually they sent her to Australia

44:00.200 --> 44:02.771
where she died of something
called spring fever.

44:20.000 --> 44:25.564
So my little Anna travelled
all the way back across the world

44:25.680 --> 44:27.444
to be with me in my dreams?

44:30.920 --> 44:32.445
She came all by herself.

44:34.920 --> 44:36.126
Well...

44:36.800 --> 44:38.643
That's one train
they couldn't get her off.

44:47.200 --> 44:50.409
But, Pol, Michael is alive.

44:58.240 --> 44:59.401
He's in England...

45:03.360 --> 45:05.124
...and I know where he lives,
I went there.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.010
- But, Pol...
-And?

45:11.280 --> 45:12.930
Okay, Polly, listen to me.

45:14.640 --> 45:16.688
Just listen to me, please.

45:18.080 --> 45:19.161
Pol!

45:19.960 --> 45:24.409
The woman that he calls "mother"
will never let him come here.

45:26.880 --> 45:28.769
Just tell me where he is, Tommy.

45:30.640 --> 45:34.087
Polly, if you go there and you get mad

45:34.440 --> 45:37.046
and she gets mad
and she calls the police,

45:37.160 --> 45:39.447
they will never let you
anywhere near him

45:39.520 --> 45:40.931
and the boy will get scared.

45:42.280 --> 45:43.884
That's what will happen, Pol.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.207
Polly.

45:48.560 --> 45:49.561
Polly...

45:49.640 --> 45:50.766
You just tell me where he is, Thomas.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.006
Tell me where he is, Thomas!

45:57.240 --> 45:58.480
Polly...

46:02.480 --> 46:03.686
Pulling the gun...

46:04.560 --> 46:06.608
Pulling the gun is why I can't tell you.

46:10.640 --> 46:15.202
Pol, I'm sorry, you're going
to have to wait till he's 18.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.682
Till he's old enough
to make his own decision.

46:23.800 --> 46:24.926
Wait!

46:26.160 --> 46:27.525
You tell me where he is!

46:33.760 --> 46:35.762
If you shoot me, you'll never know.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.847
Mickey!
Hurry up, the party's starting.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.481
Good, carry on.

47:25.560 --> 47:26.686
Finn, where you going?

47:26.760 --> 47:28.728
- To talk to Arthur.
-Right.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.446
Arthur?

47:56.920 --> 47:58.160
Go away.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.680
What's wrong? Why aren't you ready?

48:01.760 --> 48:03.046
For what?

48:03.560 --> 48:05.005
The Garrison.

48:07.160 --> 48:09.925
The reopening of your pub. It's tonight.

48:11.440 --> 48:12.771
Tommy don't want me there.

48:12.840 --> 48:15.127
It was Tommy who told me to get you.

48:15.240 --> 48:18.449
He says it's your name above that door,
so you've got to be there.

48:18.520 --> 48:21.490
No... No, look at me.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.006
I'm staying away.

48:24.480 --> 48:25.561
Go away.

48:26.240 --> 48:27.480
Get out.

48:40.240 --> 48:41.401
I told you to go away.

48:47.080 --> 48:48.764
Sometimes,

48:50.640 --> 48:53.041
when we boys are feeling blue,

48:54.640 --> 48:56.051
this is what we do.

48:57.160 --> 48:58.571
It's called Tokyo.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.724
It's good stuff, Arthur.

49:25.240 --> 49:26.526
It'll help you.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.445
For special occasions.

49:55.600 --> 49:56.647
Oh, boys!

49:57.120 --> 49:59.202
My fucking Garrison!

50:00.200 --> 50:02.248
Take that. Take that an' all.

50:02.320 --> 50:04.846
'Ere you are, Lizzie.
Let me get you a light.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.331
There you go, my darling.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.289
Jeremiah, I'll be with you in a second.

50:08.360 --> 50:09.566
Oh!

50:11.280 --> 50:12.884
Look at the place!

50:15.280 --> 50:16.361
You all right?

50:16.440 --> 50:18.442
Busier we are, the faster time passes.

50:18.520 --> 50:19.726
Yeah?

50:21.480 --> 50:25.530
Arthur. Tokyo, it's fuel for races, eh?

50:26.600 --> 50:28.682
But you've seen
a doped horse after a race...

50:28.760 --> 50:29.921
Oh, yeah.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.762
Grand openings
and race days only, brother.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.961
- All right?
-Go on then, Tommy!

50:36.040 --> 50:38.327
- There you go, come on, drink up.
-Boys.

50:38.760 --> 50:41.445
- All right, Mick?
-Tom.

50:41.840 --> 50:44.207
Finn! Gimme that.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.284
Keep him off the whisky, John.

52:17.960 --> 52:19.041
Pol.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.246
Ada! I didn't know you were coming.

52:37.320 --> 52:38.526
- There's Aunt Polly.
-Aw.

52:38.600 --> 52:39.761
Hi!

52:41.120 --> 52:42.724
Hey, who's that?

52:43.120 --> 52:44.326
D'you want a cuddle?

52:44.400 --> 52:46.607
Polly, that's right. Take him. Polly...

52:46.680 --> 52:48.887
Oh, Ada, why don't you think
about coming home?

52:48.960 --> 52:50.007
Hello, Ada.

52:50.320 --> 52:51.606
Say you'd...

52:55.240 --> 52:56.651
- Tommy...

52:57.280 --> 52:58.611
So what do you think, eh?

52:59.040 --> 53:00.166
It's very...

53:00.560 --> 53:02.289
- Gold?
-Yeah.

53:04.040 --> 53:05.087
Hello, Ada.

53:05.160 --> 53:06.650
Hello, trouble, how're you doing?

53:06.720 --> 53:09.041
- Mmm.
-Oh, you're spilling my drink!

53:09.120 --> 53:10.804
Hey, Arthur, look who it is.

53:12.040 --> 53:13.690
So what d'you want me to say to her?

53:13.760 --> 53:15.171
Just talk to her.

53:15.640 --> 53:17.404
No one can get through to her.

53:17.720 --> 53:19.006
Tell her I had no choice.

53:20.960 --> 53:21.961
I appreciate this.

53:29.720 --> 53:32.485
- Hello, brother.
-Ada, come here, you!

53:33.000 --> 53:34.365
You big bear!

53:35.720 --> 53:38.371
Polly? Why don't you come and join us?

53:45.440 --> 53:47.090
- What?
-I'm not an idiot.

53:48.320 --> 53:50.209
He asked you to come, didn't he?

53:58.160 --> 54:01.607
I don't want conversation,
I want an address.

54:01.720 --> 54:05.850
Until I have that,
I've not got anything to say.

54:05.920 --> 54:08.844
Now, it's a party!

54:08.960 --> 54:11.122
Yeah, it is! Oh!

54:15.800 --> 54:17.564
And I'm going to enjoy myself.

54:17.640 --> 54:19.210
No, Pol, don't be silly.

54:20.600 --> 54:21.601
Excuse me?

54:23.680 --> 54:25.125
Would you care to dance?

54:27.480 --> 54:29.448
It'd be my pleasure.

54:37.320 --> 54:40.688
My love, pleasure hasn't even begun.

56:53.680 --> 56:55.011
Excuse me?

56:56.680 --> 56:58.842
I'm looking for someone
called Elizabeth Gray.

56:59.600 --> 57:01.648
I was told she lived here at number 17.

57:04.120 --> 57:06.407
I came last night
but there was nobody here.

57:07.400 --> 57:08.606
So I waited.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.489
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?

57:15.040 --> 57:16.485
I think she might be my mother.

57:20.040 --> 57:30.085
