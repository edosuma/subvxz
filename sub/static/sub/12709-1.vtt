33:07.723 --> 33:09.943
Resentful dead guys?

33:15.384 --> 33:18.299
This can't be good.

33:18.386 --> 33:22.869
Come on. Manifest spirits
raised up, controlled by a...

33:24.306 --> 33:26.090
talisman.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.010
Xander.

33:33.097 --> 33:34.882
We need to find
some kind of a weapon,

33:34.969 --> 33:36.752
just to hold them off.

33:40.409 --> 33:44.282
- I got these.
- Kit, gimme your bag.

33:58.165 --> 34:00.167
Do you think
they're gonna come back?

34:00.255 --> 34:03.998
Think they're
gonna come back?
We never left.

34:04.085 --> 34:06.347
We'll always be here,
just like you.

34:06.434 --> 34:08.958
No.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.179
Why do you think
we picked you?

34:11.266 --> 34:14.443
The ones no one
will miss. The ones
that don't belong.

34:16.097 --> 34:18.882
Spend all your time trying
to get out of high school,

34:18.969 --> 34:21.059
and now you'll never,
ever leave.

34:26.193 --> 34:28.282
[ Screams ]

34:33.722 --> 34:36.248
Whoa.

34:36.335 --> 34:39.119
Contracty goodness.

34:39.206 --> 34:41.340
Talisman. Talisman.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.909
[ Gasps ]You can thank
your sister for this.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.438
Thanks, Sis.We just need
to keep them at bay.

34:55.005 --> 34:57.050
[ Dawn ] The bag!

35:31.867 --> 35:33.782
Yes!

35:34.827 --> 35:36.786
Talisman.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.579
You really wanna
keep this up?

35:47.666 --> 35:49.407
What are you gonna do?
Kill us?

35:49.494 --> 35:51.278
[ Straining ]

35:55.327 --> 35:56.980
[ Screams ]

36:02.289 --> 36:05.032
- Are they gone?
- Yeah.

36:05.119 --> 36:07.990
The talisman must've
been destroyed.

36:08.077 --> 36:11.038
How'd you know
it was a talisman?

36:11.125 --> 36:13.867
There's always
a talisman.

36:13.954 --> 36:17.043
[ Sighs ]
The real question is
who put it there.

36:17.130 --> 36:19.960
[ Buffy ] Come on, you guys. Let's go find a way upstairs.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.961
Assuming
there is one.

36:24.224 --> 36:27.576
You really weren't kidding
about this place.

36:27.663 --> 36:30.405
I guess
it hasn't changed.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.929
I don't know.
Seems smaller.

36:35.844 --> 36:38.021
You guys are
gonna be okay.

36:38.108 --> 36:40.588
The school's intense,
but you'll do all right,
as long as you're careful.

36:40.675 --> 36:43.722
And, uh, you might wanna think
about stickin' together.

36:43.809 --> 36:45.637
Thank you.

36:47.639 --> 36:50.947
Yeah,
I mean it. You are
the coolest mom ever.

36:52.949 --> 36:57.083
Okay. Come on.
We still have a few more
classes to live through.

37:03.699 --> 37:06.659
"Curiouser and curiouser."

37:06.746 --> 37:10.793
What is?Carlos Trejo
and Kit Hollburn, right?

37:10.880 --> 37:15.710
Possibly the only two students
in this school whose files are
as thick as yours was.

37:15.797 --> 37:17.931
You really
did your homework,
didn't you?

37:18.018 --> 37:21.239
I was looking for one
or both of them to actually
implode in a fearsome way...

37:21.326 --> 37:27.027
right before midterms,
but now I see you got them
socializing and hugging,

37:27.114 --> 37:29.724
and actually, if I'm not
mistaken, headed toclass.

37:29.811 --> 37:33.119
Well, we shared
an... encounter.

37:33.206 --> 37:36.253
Look. I know you're
probably more than happy
to get out of this place,

37:36.340 --> 37:38.298
but I gotta tell ya,
Miss Summers.

37:38.385 --> 37:40.606
I think you belong here.Hmm, new?

37:40.693 --> 37:42.650
Listen. I know
this school's reputation.

37:42.737 --> 37:45.132
What, you think I got
this job based on seniority?

37:45.219 --> 37:47.394
We got a lot of troubled
students here,

37:47.481 --> 37:49.657
and just enough money to keep
this place from caving in.

37:49.744 --> 37:52.094
Yeah, you might need
a little extra there.

37:52.181 --> 37:54.532
Well, we do have
a community outreach program,

37:54.619 --> 37:58.753
and the money we could pay you
wouldn't even fold,

37:58.840 --> 38:00.887
but it would just be
a couple of days a week?

38:00.974 --> 38:04.804
Are you asking me
to be a counselor?

38:04.891 --> 38:08.110
Well, we have a guidance
counselor, but I was thinking
the kids could use someone,

38:08.197 --> 38:09.764
you know, closer to
their age, who's still--

38:09.851 --> 38:11.766
I'm in.

38:11.853 --> 38:15.815
What? You serious?
You did hear the part
about the money, right?

38:15.902 --> 38:19.297
Yeah, I heard. My schedule
might be a little "funtastic,"

38:19.384 --> 38:22.822
but, uh,
I'll work it out.

38:22.909 --> 38:27.173
I'd like to keep
an eye on this place.That's great.

38:27.260 --> 38:29.306
Look at that.
It's not even noon,

38:29.393 --> 38:31.525
and I've already bullied
my first family member
into helping out.

38:31.612 --> 38:33.135
I'm gonna be
the best principal ever.

38:37.271 --> 38:39.099
[ Spike ] Everything is.

38:40.447 --> 38:42.623
I had a speech.

38:42.710 --> 38:44.496
I learned it all.

38:46.367 --> 38:49.717
Oh, God.
She won't understand.
She won't understand.

38:49.804 --> 38:55.637
Of course
she won't understand, Sparky.
I'm beyond her understanding.

38:55.724 --> 38:59.684
She's a girl-- with sugar
and spice and everything
useless, unless you're baking.

38:59.771 --> 39:02.469
I'm more than that.

39:02.556 --> 39:06.474
More than flesh,
 more than blood,

39:06.561 --> 39:11.043
I'm-- You know, I honestly
don't think there's a human
word fabulous enough for me.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.788
Oh, my name will be
on everyone's lips,

39:15.875 --> 39:19.094
assuming their lips
haven't been torn off.

39:19.181 --> 39:22.882
But not just yet.
That's all right though.

39:22.969 --> 39:25.144
I can be patient.

39:25.231 --> 39:28.103
Everything is
well within parameters.

39:29.844 --> 39:33.195
She's exactly where
I want her to be,

39:33.282 --> 39:36.460
and so are you,
Number 17.

39:36.547 --> 39:38.811
You're right where you belong.

39:41.726 --> 39:45.992
So, what did you think?
You'd get your soul back, and
everything would be jim-dandy?

39:46.079 --> 39:49.081
A soul's slipperier
than a greased weasel.
Why do you think I sold mine?

39:49.168 --> 39:52.085
[ Chuckles ]

39:52.172 --> 39:56.349
Well, you probably thought
that you'd be your own man,
and I respect that.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.744
But you never will.

40:00.135 --> 40:03.096
[ Drusilla ]
You'll always be mine.

40:03.182 --> 40:06.664
You'll always be
in the dark with me,

40:06.751 --> 40:10.494
singing our little songs.

40:10.581 --> 40:13.322
You like our little songs,
don't you?

40:13.411 --> 40:15.630
You've always liked them.

40:15.717 --> 40:18.938
Right from the beginning.

40:19.025 --> 40:21.766
And that's where
we're going.

40:21.853 --> 40:24.465
Right back
to the beginning.

40:24.552 --> 40:29.688
Not the bang.
Not the word.

40:29.775 --> 40:33.648
The true beginning.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.650
The next few months
are going to be quite
a ride,

40:36.737 --> 40:40.960
and I think we're all
going to learn something
about ourselves in the process.

40:41.047 --> 40:44.442
You'll learn you're
a pathetic schmuck,

40:44.528 --> 40:47.922
if it hasn't sunk in
already.

40:48.010 --> 40:50.143
Look at you...

40:50.230 --> 40:52.927
trying to do
what's right,

40:53.014 --> 40:55.148
just like her.

40:55.235 --> 40:57.324
You still don't get it.

40:57.411 --> 41:01.588
It's not about right.
 It's not about wrong.

41:08.335 --> 41:11.251
It's about power.

41:42.456 --> 41:44.284
Grr! Arrgh!
