02:31.151 --> 02:32.773
Shit. It's under.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.981
He doesn't know that.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.910
Yes!

03:00.514 --> 03:02.466
Oh, yeah.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.240
G'day.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.581
Get out of the vehicle.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.671
No worries.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.643
Know how fast you were going?

04:28.852 --> 04:31.396
Faster than I was supposed to,
if you blokes pulled me up.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.556
You shoot pigs for a living?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.192
Bet your life.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.230
Can you read?

04:41.573 --> 04:44.617
Well, get a bit stuck on the big words
every now and then, but you know.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.782
Yeah, I can read pretty good.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.246
Then you'd be able to
read the sign back there

04:49.247 --> 04:52.326
with the big one-fuckin'-double-zero
on it, wouldn't you?

04:52.876 --> 04:57.957
You know, I could've sworn I was, you
know, sittin' under 100 there. You know.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.843
You think I'm talking shit?

05:03.261 --> 05:06.761
Struth no. No, sorry, mate. No.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.100
No, look, won't happen
again, all right?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.439
Where the fuck you
think you're going?

05:19.236 --> 05:22.280
You bastards. You're
putting me on, aren't you?

05:22.489 --> 05:24.282
You're not really going
to book me, are you?

05:27.244 --> 05:29.412
Can I see your license, please?

05:49.015 --> 05:50.762
You're a long way
from home, aren't ya?

05:51.393 --> 05:55.312
Look, always travel up north when I'm
doing a bit of hunting, you know.

05:55.313 --> 05:59.063
Get away from it all. Not
a lot of pigs down south.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.937
Ooh!

06:05.657 --> 06:08.030
This, plus a speeding ticket.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.991
It's an order to take
this car off the road

06:11.746 --> 06:12.947
for good.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.876
Tires are as bald as a baby's ass.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.624
Amazed it's even running.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.131
Body looks like you've thrown
it off a fuckin' cliff!

06:22.132 --> 06:23.333
Aw...

06:25.302 --> 06:26.503
Come on.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.886
Now you take this piece
of shit back to town,

06:31.182 --> 06:33.851
and then you get the fuck
back where you came from.

06:34.644 --> 06:38.144
I don't want to see your ugly
mug around here ever again.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.518
You understand?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.816
Or is that too many
big words for you?

06:55.290 --> 06:57.288
Mate, you sure you
want to give me this?

06:57.834 --> 06:59.411
Bet your life.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.841
You have a nice day.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.502
Ta!

07:37.874 --> 07:41.377
You fuckin' asshole. Oh, man.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.545
That's how we keep our
quotas up out here, son.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.419
Oh, man. "You sure you
want to give me this?"

07:45.882 --> 07:49.677
Yeah. Pretty sure you just got that rusted
piece of shit taken off the road, too.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.886
Fuckin' dickhead.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.761
Oh, man, did you see
the look on his face?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.725
What a redneck moron.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.651
Jesus! Fuck! Fuck!

08:04.901 --> 08:06.148
Fuck, the...

08:09.239 --> 08:10.440
Fuck!

08:57.620 --> 08:58.821
Shot!

09:20.810 --> 09:23.308
Where the bloody hell do
you think you're going?

09:26.941 --> 09:28.393
You're crazy, mate!

09:29.110 --> 09:30.812
Not me leg. I think it's broken.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.484
Yeah.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.115
Ah, shut up, you big crybaby.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.374
That'll do, pig.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.997
What do you think
you're fuckin' doing?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.174
You know, your little mate's right.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.968
I am a pig shooter.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.797
You know what I do to pigs
who won't stop squealing?

10:01.017 --> 10:02.810
I make 'em stop!

10:17.033 --> 10:18.860
Fuck me.

10:19.202 --> 10:22.246
You stupid pair of bastards.

10:22.997 --> 10:27.247
Look at the fuckin' mess you made,
huh? Now, I gotta clean it up.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.380
They'll fuckin' find us!

10:31.381 --> 10:34.004
They'll find the fuckin'
car and then they'll...

10:41.015 --> 10:42.216
Fuck.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.111
I want to see my kids.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.943
Why?

11:04.747 --> 11:07.450
Mate... Mate, wait.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.752
I can make the ticket
go away, mate.

11:10.879 --> 11:14.458
Or I can make you go away.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.041
Let's go! You are seriously a hero.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.105
Hello.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.246
Cool.

15:44.861 --> 15:49.692
Hey! Thank you! Thank you!

16:09.218 --> 16:10.761
Have a good trip.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.467
Awesome.

17:41.686 --> 17:44.646
They are so cute. I love them.

17:44.647 --> 17:45.848
What are they called again?

17:45.940 --> 17:48.313
The little black one's
called Nutella.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.484
Yeah, we have that in Europe, too.

17:49.485 --> 17:53.030
I know it's brown, but it's my
little daughter's idea of a joke.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.074
And the little one with the
broken horn is called Casper.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.869
And, uh, the other
one, that's Marley.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.489
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.620
- It's all right.
- Here we are.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.873
Bye-bye, kids.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.580
- Thank you. Auf Wiedersehen.
- See ya. Okay.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.053
- See ya, love.
- Thank you very much.

19:37.635 --> 19:40.008
So cool.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.821
Oops.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.665
Hello, and, uh, goodbye.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.634
All right, if you keep fighting
you're gonna go back to the car.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.440
Motherfucker!

20:44.994 --> 20:47.434
What's wrong with you people?
You afraid to stop or something?

22:42.111 --> 22:43.312
Yahtzee.

24:54.410 --> 24:57.238
What the bloody hell are you
buggers doing out here?

24:57.746 --> 25:00.244
This is a national park.
You can't camp here, mate.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.077
Uh...

25:04.503 --> 25:09.083
Sorry, we did not know that was the
case. About national parks, I mean.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.918
No signs here.

25:11.760 --> 25:16.056
Oh, well, don't get your knickers in a knot,
mate, I'm not a ranger or anything. Eh?

25:16.265 --> 25:19.600
Look at this bloody fire, mate.
You haven't put it out properly.

25:19.601 --> 25:23.021
All this bloody saltbush around
here is dry as a nun's nasty.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.645
You know, one spark, the whole
bloody place will go up!

25:25.858 --> 25:27.191
Ah. I...

25:27.192 --> 25:28.985
I did put some water on it.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.479
Yeah?

25:30.988 --> 25:34.317
Well, for all the good you've done,
you may as well have pissed on it, eh?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.615
It was a good thing
I found you, huh?

25:37.786 --> 25:39.454
Name's Mick.

25:39.621 --> 25:40.822
Rutger.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.867
Rutger. Rutger! Eh?

25:44.626 --> 25:45.827
Kraut, are ya?

25:46.295 --> 25:48.212
I'm, um... From Germany.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.256
They usually are.

25:53.427 --> 25:54.628
Okay.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.171
Oh...

25:56.597 --> 25:59.425
Heil, Fräulein.

25:59.725 --> 26:00.926
Hi.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.513
Little bit of German for you.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.515
It's good, Fräulein.

26:05.814 --> 26:09.939
As I was saying, mate, if
the rangers did find you,

26:10.694 --> 26:13.192
you'd be charged, right?
You wouldn't want that, would you?

26:14.490 --> 26:15.573
No.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.992
As a matter of fact, mate,
I'm going back through town,

26:17.993 --> 26:20.036
so I can give you a lift, okay?

26:20.329 --> 26:23.248
You know, and set you up in a
caravan park for the night.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.833
Right? Yeah?

26:25.834 --> 26:28.787
You wouldn't want to be hiking
back into town, would you?

26:28.837 --> 26:32.462
No, we were hoping to
get lift tomorrow.

26:32.925 --> 26:37.301
Like I said, there's no signs here, so did
not think we were doing anything wrong.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.224
Well, I'm offering you a
lift, mate, you know.

26:41.225 --> 26:42.802
So you won't get caught.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.852
Um...

26:44.853 --> 26:47.727
Are you sure there's no camping
here? I checked on the map.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.062
I just said so, didn't I?

26:55.531 --> 26:57.449
Well, yes, but...

26:58.826 --> 27:01.700
Well, you calling me a liar?

27:03.539 --> 27:04.664
Um...

27:04.665 --> 27:09.462
Look, I'm gonna give you one
last chance to help you out.

27:09.711 --> 27:10.912
All right?

27:17.886 --> 27:20.430
Thank you, but, um, we will stay.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.305
Sorry about the fire and for
making you come out of your way.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.475
Don't you turn your back
on me, you Nazi bastard!

27:37.322 --> 27:40.901
So, let me hear you talk
back now, you dopey cunt.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.620
Rutger!

27:43.871 --> 27:45.197
Rutger!

27:45.914 --> 27:47.115
Rutger!

27:48.250 --> 27:49.451
Rutger!

27:51.170 --> 27:52.417
Let me go!

27:52.421 --> 27:54.123
Let me go!

28:01.346 --> 28:03.093
Eh?

28:08.353 --> 28:12.558
Keep still. Keep still.
Keep fucking still!

28:13.734 --> 28:15.026
Now put your hands together.

28:15.777 --> 28:21.234
Put your fucking hands together, or I'll
spread your nose all over your face.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.402
Huh?

28:24.661 --> 28:26.863
Now look, I didn't
want to do you here,

28:27.164 --> 28:30.834
but your stupid fucking
boyfriend forced me.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.916
And now, why wait, eh?

28:41.720 --> 28:44.548
Anyways, my name's Mick Taylor.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.684
Pleased to meet you.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.263
You know...

28:51.480 --> 28:55.810
I still don't know what you friggin'
tourists see in this place.

28:57.486 --> 29:01.364
I mean, is this the way you
spend your life, Fräulein?

29:01.365 --> 29:02.566
Eh?

29:03.200 --> 29:06.870
Coming out here and
shitting in our backyard?

29:08.413 --> 29:09.990
Is that what it's all about, eh?

29:10.874 --> 29:11.999
Is it, eh?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.201
I'm talking to you.

29:13.377 --> 29:14.829
Talking to you!

29:16.171 --> 29:19.420
Oh...

29:21.009 --> 29:22.210
Oh, look at that, eh?

29:40.779 --> 29:41.980
Cookies!

29:45.909 --> 29:47.110
Rutger!

29:57.713 --> 29:59.085
Rutger!

30:00.465 --> 30:02.588
Rutger, no!

30:24.239 --> 30:25.440
Eh?

30:45.469 --> 30:46.670
Shit!

30:46.803 --> 30:49.131
He's tougher than a pig.

30:49.431 --> 30:52.384
Where you crawling
off to, Fräulein?

30:58.774 --> 31:00.191
Now,

31:01.276 --> 31:03.023
I promise you.

31:03.320 --> 31:10.495
We're gonna spend a nice,
long, few months together.

32:10.220 --> 32:12.263
There we go!

32:13.974 --> 32:15.551
Non-smoker.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.889
Gutless Kraut now, huh?

32:24.401 --> 32:25.602
Jesus!

32:25.777 --> 32:29.402
Rutger, what are you,
part bloody donkey?

32:29.698 --> 32:33.159
Who's the lucky girl, then? That'd
make your eyes water, wouldn't it?

32:35.537 --> 32:37.410
Here's a little piggy,
here's his snout.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.500
Slit him open and
his guts fail out.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.751
Get your fucking head out of there.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.429
All good.

32:53.430 --> 32:54.927
The dogs'll like that.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.593
Oh, you mongrel bastard.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.147
Oh, Jesus.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.187
Come on!

33:05.275 --> 33:06.476
Come on.

33:07.736 --> 33:11.110
Quickest way to a man's heart
is through his chest, eh?

33:12.240 --> 33:15.910
Doesn't look fucking easy getting through
that fucking breastplate, does it?

33:16.578 --> 33:18.906
Can you fucking believe it?
There we are.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.248
Oh, no. Rip your heart out.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.371
There we go!

34:00.622 --> 34:03.826
Hide and seek, is it?

34:26.313 --> 34:27.982
Hey, come on, girly.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.851
Up the ass.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.989
Wait, wait.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.750
You have to run faster than that.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.381
Clever bitch, eh?

35:45.060 --> 35:47.354
Beck?

35:47.604 --> 35:49.063
Becky?

35:49.064 --> 35:50.561
Hello, Angel?

35:52.567 --> 35:55.941
I can't hear you, babe.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.697
Um...

35:58.698 --> 35:59.899
Becky.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.118
Bollocks.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.879
Holy shit!

36:15.757 --> 36:17.300
Help me!

36:19.928 --> 36:21.129
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

36:21.763 --> 36:23.260
What happened?

36:23.556 --> 36:24.757
Did you get hit?

36:26.434 --> 36:27.476
What?

36:27.477 --> 36:30.158
It's all right. Come on! We're gonna
get you out of here, all right?

36:33.358 --> 36:34.559
All right.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.019
Whoa.

36:37.904 --> 36:40.072
Hey, is there anyone else?
Is there anyone...

36:41.074 --> 36:43.242
Who did this shit to you?

36:43.493 --> 36:45.036
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on!

36:45.453 --> 36:47.121
Give me your hand, all right?

36:47.288 --> 36:49.331
I don't understand you!

36:53.795 --> 36:56.089
Who's this fucking maggot?

37:08.977 --> 37:10.850
Who was that? Who was that?

37:12.272 --> 37:14.691
What the fuck is going on here?

37:55.648 --> 37:57.691
You'll have to do better
than that, asshole!

38:20.882 --> 38:23.050
Oh, shit! It's all right!

38:23.051 --> 38:28.098
Hey, little pigs, little pigs!
Let me come in!

38:31.559 --> 38:32.851
It's all right!

38:39.609 --> 38:40.935
Come on, you fucker!

38:44.739 --> 38:45.940
Whoa!

38:49.494 --> 38:51.116
Fuck! Fuck!

39:09.430 --> 39:10.631
Hold on!

39:19.858 --> 39:21.059
Oh, God!

39:37.584 --> 39:40.082
It's all right.
Hang on. It's all right.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.300
See you in hell, cunt!

39:47.969 --> 39:49.170
Jesus.

39:49.762 --> 39:50.929
Yeah!

39:50.930 --> 39:52.473
Oh, shit!

39:58.688 --> 39:59.889
Are you all right?

40:06.863 --> 40:08.064
Oh, shit!

40:27.175 --> 40:28.258
Fuck!

40:28.259 --> 40:30.052
For fuck's sake, Mick!

40:40.688 --> 40:42.481
Don't!

41:07.048 --> 41:08.249
Fuck!

43:19.764 --> 43:20.965
I'm...

43:28.189 --> 43:29.390
I'm sorry.

45:54.293 --> 45:55.494
Shit!

45:55.795 --> 45:59.169
Shit, shit, shit!

46:00.883 --> 46:02.084
Uh...

46:16.941 --> 46:18.142
Hey!

46:22.488 --> 46:23.940
Oh, shit!

46:33.708 --> 46:37.037
What the fuck's wrong
with you, you pricks?

46:37.545 --> 46:40.248
Stop, you fucking bastards!

46:52.476 --> 46:53.677
Okay.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.102
Okay.

47:25.509 --> 47:26.710
Hey!

47:27.762 --> 47:28.963
Hey!

47:30.931 --> 47:32.132
Stop!

47:34.518 --> 47:36.971
Here! Hey!

47:50.117 --> 47:51.910
Oh, fuck me.

47:59.460 --> 48:01.037
Oh, shit!

48:22.441 --> 48:24.814
Thanks for the truck, blubber guts.

48:24.985 --> 48:26.277
Let's play, eh?

48:34.286 --> 48:35.988
Come on!

49:15.953 --> 49:17.154
Oh, shit!

49:21.750 --> 49:22.951
Whoops.

49:31.719 --> 49:32.920
Bit of music, eh?

50:09.298 --> 50:11.000
Oh, shit!

50:17.598 --> 50:18.799
Oh, shit!

50:20.351 --> 50:24.897
Hey! Shit! Flying kangaroo!

50:26.815 --> 50:30.110
Oh! Sorry, Skippy.

50:34.281 --> 50:35.778
Hey!

50:43.123 --> 50:45.792
Welcome to Australia, cocksucker.

50:59.974 --> 51:01.175
Come on.

51:30.337 --> 51:31.538
Oh!

52:34.276 --> 52:35.773
Come on!

53:00.469 --> 53:02.421
Shit!

53:53.355 --> 53:56.684
You'll have to do better than that!

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.949
He's got to be hungry, I know that.

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:04.782
We didn't know whether to wake you.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:09.325
We're heading to town as soon
as you've eaten something.

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:17.590
Phone?

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:19.675
No phones.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.753
We got shortwave if it was working.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:26.307
It's the magnets. Something
weird in the ground.

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:29.603
Even the TV goes on the
blink now and again.

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.226
Ah, you got to be
self-sufficient out here.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:36.313
It's all right.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.026
You're safe now.

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:40.715
I'm Lil.

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:43.919
This is Jack.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.884
Paul.

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:56.060
Come on, son. Eat up.
You'll need your strength.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.126
I made it special for you.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:29.423
You in there, hero?

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:35.178
You don't want anyone else
to get hurt, do you, eh?

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.227
He's here.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:46.740
Don't you worry, mate.
I'll see to it.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.474
Get off my property.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:20.144
Hey, mate. The boy. Hand him over.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:25.279
I said get the hell away from here.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:31.780
Now get.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:56.225
He's gone.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:58.394
No. No, he's...

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.018
He's not.

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:04.146
He will be if I see him again.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.277
The car's at the front.

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:09.446
We'll all go out together.

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:11.028
You got the keys, no?

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:12.358
I can't.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:26.960
Shit.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:18.682
Hey, baby.

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:21.432
We could have had a
good time, you and me.

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.653
Please!

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:00.981
Just leave me alone.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.866
Fucking Pommy, eh?

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.319
I...

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:11.828
- Huh. Definitely a Pommy.
- Weak as piss.

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:25.607
Obviously don't know the
first rule of the Outback, hero.

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:31.037
You never, ever stop.

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:36.417
Could have saved yourself
a whole lot of trouble.

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:44.583
Why you here, Pommy?

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:50.757
Please...

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.686
I asked you a question.

01:11:55.937 --> 01:11:58.765
- Why are you here?
- Please...

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.059
Please... I didn't...

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:05.316
I didn't mean to interfere.

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:10.409
I should have just left her there
and minded my own business.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:14.990
Well, maybe I can
answer it for you, huh?

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:17.701
You're here for an adventure.

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:21.461
You're here for a bit
of excitement, hmm?

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:26.174
- For the thrill, hey? Hey?
- Yes. Yes! Yes!

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.634
- Something a bit different!
- Please.

01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:31.465
Please!
Just let me out of here.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.429
And I'll just walk away.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.518
That's a good one.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:40.105
You expect to come to
my fucking country,

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:43.275
waltz around like you
own the bloody place,

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:47.445
come between a man and his
meal and "just walk away," eh?

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:48.864
Just like that?

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:51.488
Please! Don't!

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:56.789
You owe me, boy.

01:12:57.498 --> 01:13:00.292
What made you think you could
just take her away from me, huh?

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:01.960
Just wanted to...

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:03.837
Hey? Hey, hey, hey?

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:07.508
Where's your famous
English wit, now? Huh?

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:12.971
Even harder to be a smartass
with no fucking tongue.

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:16.679
There once was a lad from York,

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:18.852
who picked his nose with a fork.

01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:21.646
And when it got stuck, he
cried, "I don't give a fuck,"

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:24.600
and walked around
looking like a dork.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:29.613
There once was a man,
uh, from Kansas,

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:32.157
whose nuts were made of brass.

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:35.908
In stormy weather, he'd clack them together,
and lightning would shoot out his ass.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:40.074
What are you doing, Pom? Hmm?

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:44.669
There once was an old lady from
Wheeling, who had a peculiar feeling.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:48.465
And she lied on her back,
and tickled her crack,

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.880
and pissed all over the ceiling.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:57.557
"Pissed all over the ceiling."

01:13:57.558 --> 01:13:59.643
You're a funny little
fuck, aren't ya, eh?

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:02.063
English wit, mate.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:04.228
Where'd you learn those?

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.062
Boarding school.

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:07.859
Boarding school, huh?

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.861
Pants-down, botty-whackers, eh?

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:12.565
Only on weekends.

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:16.201
You still know fuck
all about my country,

01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:18.700
eh, you little Pommy ponce?

01:14:18.746 --> 01:14:22.166
There once was an
Australian stockman,

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:25.412
lying, dying.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:29.756
And he got up on one elbow

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:34.053
and he turned to his mates who had
all gathered around and he said...

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:37.382
<i>Watch me Wallabies feed, mate</i>

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:40.096
<i>Watch me Wallabies feed</i>

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:42.560
<i>They're a dangerous breed, mate</i>

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:43.978
<i>So watch me Wallabies feed</i>

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.105
<i>All together now!</i>

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:47.649
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.773
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:52.445
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:54.273
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:57.075
<i>Keep me cockatoo cool, Curl</i>

01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:58.994
<i>Keep me cockatoo cool</i>

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:01.746
<i>Don't go acting a fool, Curl</i>

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:04.374
<i>Just keep me cockatoo cool
All together now!</i>

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.577
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.587
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:11.589
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:13.337
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:16.094
<i>Take me koala back, Jack</i>

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:17.887
<i>Take me koala back</i>

01:15:17.888 --> 01:15:20.265
<i>He lives somewhere out
on the track, Mac</i>

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:21.933
<i>So take me koala back</i>

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:23.184
<i>All together now!</i>

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.228
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:27.181
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:29.816
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:31.815
<i>Tie me kangaroo down</i>

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:34.571
<i>Play your didgeridoo, Blue</i>

01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:36.322
<i>Play your didgeridoo</i>

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:38.950
<i>Keep playing 'til I
shoot through, Blue</i>

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:40.285
<i>Play your didgeridoo</i>

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:41.829
<i>All together...</i>

01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:48.294
<i>Tan me hide when I'm dead, Fred</i>

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:52.173
<i>Tan me hide when I'm dead</i>

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:55.633
<i>So we tanned his hide
when he died, Clyde</i>

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.802
<i>And that's it hanging on the shed!
Hey!</i>

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:05.019
Fuck me.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:10.353
You mad little British bastard.

01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:12.025
Well, you know...

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:14.027
Where do you know that song from?

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:16.151
Uh... My mother had the record.

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:18.820
- Oh.
- We'd listen to it endlessly as kids.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:22.661
My word, eh?

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:27.204
You are a knowledgeable
little prick, eh?

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.136
I'll tell you what, mate.

01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:43.556
Let's have a fucking drink, eh?

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:47.435
I thought you'd never
fucking ask, mate.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:50.230
"I thought you'd
never fucking ask."

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:23.429
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:29.238
There you are, son. Let's wrap the
laughing gear around this one, eh?

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:31.935
Oh. Thanks. It'd be better
to have a free hand.

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:35.522
Oh. Thanks for mentioning that.
I would never have thought. You know.

01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:36.894
There we go.

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:40.731
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:50.957
- Get that up, son.
- Thank you.

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:52.375
Please.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.209
Here's looking up ya bum.

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:06.469
Whoo...

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.099
All right, isn't it?

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:11.769
Tastes like camel's piss but, Jesus,
it gives a man a fuckin' buzz.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:14.564
Rum. It's all me and my mates
used to drink back home.

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:16.816
Yeah? Rum, eh? Here's a good one.

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:19.944
<i>My name is old Jack Palmer
I once dug for gold</i>

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:22.697
<i>The song I'm 'bout to sing ya
Recalls the days of old</i>

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:25.450
<i>When I'd plenty mates around me
and the mates would fairly hum</i>

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:28.655
<i>As we all sat together
round the old keg of rum</i>

01:18:28.913 --> 01:18:32.123
<i>The old keg of rum,
the old keg of rum</i>

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:35.794
<i>As we all sat together
round the old keg of rum</i>

01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:38.501
<i>The old keg of rum...</i>

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:44.838
<i>Australians all, let us rejoice</i>

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:50.051
<i>For we are young and free</i>

01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:55.978
<i>With golden soil and
wealth for toil</i>

01:18:56.148 --> 01:19:00.228
<i>Our home is girt by sea</i>

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:05.240
I hate that fucking song.

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:06.866
"Girt by sea."

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:07.951
Who's "Gert"?

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:10.119
Some fucking big butch lesbian

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.580
standing astride Sydney
fucking heads or something.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.203
It's a fucking shit song.

01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:18.203
Hmm...

01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:19.747
Oh, shit.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:31.639
Now, seeing as you're such an amusing
fucking Einstein know-it-all bastard,

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:34.310
I got this little game
we can play, huh?

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:36.396
- Kind of like a quiz. Yeah.
- Right.

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:40.149
I call it Aussie history.

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:44.862
I ask you 10 questions, you get
half of 'em right, so, five,

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.572
and then I'll let you go.

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:48.525
Does that sound all right to you?

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:53.997
That's... That sounds
fucking brilliant.

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:55.541
Really?

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:58.581
Sorry. I didn't get
your name, mate.

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:00.587
Ah. Mick Taylor's the name.

01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:03.965
Pig-shooter and general
fuckin' Outback legend.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:05.883
Right. Cheers.

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:08.928
- You ready to rock 'n' roll?
- Yeah.

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:20.144
What's that for, Mick?

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:22.351
Oh, I forgot to mention.

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:28.115
For each one that you get wrong,
I get to grind off a finger.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.331
So, 10 questions, 10 fingers. Kind
of fitting, you know what I mean?

01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:36.957
Of course.

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:42.587
So it's sort of like Who
Wants To Be a Millionaire?

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:43.796
Yeah!

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:46.424
Except you don't get to phone
a friend if you get one wrong

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:50.220
because you'll be too busy
screaming in fucking agony.

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.303
All right.

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:00.355
Let's rock 'n' roll then.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.484
All right. We'll start
off with an easy one.

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:09.031
What Aboriginal term
meaning "waterhole"

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:13.824
is also the name of an Australian
surf clothing company?

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:24.663
Billabong.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:27.499
Very good.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.009
- Next one's a bit harder.
- Right.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:32.212
But you're a stinkin' Pom,
so you'll be all right.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:38.019
In what year did the British
settle in Australia?

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:45.267
Oh, um...

01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:53.574
After Lieutenant James Cook
discovered the east coast

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:56.028
and mapped it in 1770,

01:21:57.079 --> 01:22:00.032
the First Fleet arrived
and settled on

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:04.545
26th of January, 1788.

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.716
Does that answer your question?

01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:13.553
Jesus! You are a smart cunt.

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:17.266
I might have to let you
go on that answer alone.

01:22:18.892 --> 01:22:21.310
Where'd you learn all that shit?

01:22:21.311 --> 01:22:22.763
I'm majoring in history.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:26.225
Majoring in history? That's a
fucking coincidence, isn't it, eh?

01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:31.904
But I am a man of my word,
and either way, you know,

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:34.984
I did say 10...

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:36.985
Here we go.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.912
Okay.

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:48.334
Mmm.

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:51.007
Rightio.

01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:57.966
In what year did the British start
deporting convicts to Australia?

01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:03.060
The first 11 ships of the First
Fleet arrived with their cargo

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:07.482
of around 780 British convicts
in Botany Bay, New South Wales.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.106
And a further two convict fleets
arrived in 1790 and 1791.

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:18.243
The first free settlers
arrived in 1793.

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:21.621
Mick?

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:24.624
Mick?

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.452
That's right. Isn't it?

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:28.329
I know it is.

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:31.711
Why?

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.377
Um...

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:40.716
I'm not really sure I
understand the question.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:47.189
Why did the British deport
convicts to Australia?

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:50.191
Why? Um...

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:52.811
Uh...

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:57.114
Come on, you dumb fuck.

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:58.741
Time waits for no man.

01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:01.661
- No, no, no!
- Tick, took, tick, took, tick...

01:24:01.995 --> 01:24:04.163
First, first... First of all,

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:06.791
after the British
lost the 13 colonies

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:10.127
they'd lost their penal settlements
in Virginia, in the United States.

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:13.172
And they needed somewhere
to put all the criminals

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:14.465
that were stacking up in England.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:16.676
There were... There were just
too many of these people,

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:20.096
and they were just spreading
disease and wasting resources.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:22.391
And, second of all, they...

01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:25.685
And just, Australia looked
to be as rich in resources

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:26.936
as the Americas.

01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:29.936
And obviously the British wanted to
settle this before the French did.

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:32.317
Or the Dutch.

01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:35.353
Something like that?

01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:38.406
Mick, no. What the fuck,
man? That's right!

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:42.202
What are you doing? Mick! Fuck!
That's the right fucking answer!

01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:44.696
What do you want me to fucking...

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:47.158
Fuck! Mick, that's right!

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:50.042
Fuck! That's the right
fucking answer, Mick!

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:53.497
Mick! Jesus Christ! No!
I got two. Come on!

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:56.299
You don't need to fucking do this!
I got them all right.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.798
It's the right fucking answer!

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:16.944
It was fucking right!

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:20.031
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was the right fucking...

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:21.575
No, it wasn't.

01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:25.161
The right answer is

01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:30.666
because they are a
pack of Pommy cunts.

01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:40.419
No, seriously, you're right,
you know, technically.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.424
And that gives me the shits.

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:54.646
Come on. Calm down. Calm down.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:57.443
Jesus Christ, you're going
on like a big girl.

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:58.941
It fucking hurt.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:02.733
Knock those tears off. Knock
'em off, you bloody suck.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.871
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:12.793
Jesus H. Christ, boy.
You all right? You all right?

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:14.418
Yeah.

01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:17.581
Right? All right?

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:22.711
All right.

01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:28.307
Just one more quick one. An easy one
and then I'll get us another drink.

01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:30.431
And you can be on your way. Eh?

01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:34.807
You're doing real well, mate.
You're doing real well.

01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:39.770
Cheers.

01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:49.325
Now, who's Australia's
most famous cricketer?

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:52.366
And not Shane fucking Warne.

01:26:57.003 --> 01:26:58.204
Come on.

01:27:07.013 --> 01:27:08.305
Come on.

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:13.804
I don't know anything
about fucking cricket.

01:27:14.938 --> 01:27:17.436
Can you ask me a football question?

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:21.152
You don't have to know about
cricket to know who this bloke is.

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:22.987
Just give me a clue.

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:25.698
Well, he's the greatest
cricketer of all time.

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:28.159
The Muhammad Ali of
fucking cricket!

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.408
Oh, shit. Come on, Paul.

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:32.538
It's on the tip of
my fucking tongue!

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:35.708
Yeah, well, look. This will be on the
tip of your bloody tongue in a minute!

01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:38.335
What kind of a bloody
idiot you take me for?

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:40.709
What letter does it
fucking start with?

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:42.506
"D."

01:27:42.507 --> 01:27:45.711
D... D... D...

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:48.927
- Douglas Jardine.
- Fucking Pommy, you idiot.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.686
Dennis... Dennis Lillee.

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:56.854
Not fucking Dennis Lillee.

01:27:56.855 --> 01:27:58.689
- It's Dennis fucking Lillee.
- It's not Dennis Lillee.

01:27:58.690 --> 01:27:59.940
A famous cricketer
that starts with "D."

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:03.190
It's not fucking
Dennis fucking Lillee.

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:06.113
What the fuck is it
then if it's not...

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.316
Fuck this! Fuck you!

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:11.410
No, no, no! Please! Please!
Jesus Christ, the other hand!

01:28:11.411 --> 01:28:13.954
- Eh?
- Use the fucking other hand, Mick!

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:16.999
Is that your wanking hand, is it?

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:19.335
Please yourself.

01:28:19.336 --> 01:28:21.914
Mick, it's Dennis fucking Lillee!

01:28:22.047 --> 01:28:24.548
Dennis fucking Lillee! Please!

01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:28.253
Please! Please! Mick! Mick! Mick!

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:30.422
It's Dennis Lillee...

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:32.181
Give me that fucking hand

01:28:32.182 --> 01:28:36.432
or I'll knock your fucking teeth
right down your fucking throat.

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.563
You understand me? Eh? Eh?

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.234
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:53.361
Oh, no!

01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:32.112
Please.

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:35.036
Just let me out of here.

01:29:35.078 --> 01:29:36.912
Of course I am going to let
you out of there, mate.

01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:39.161
You've been a real good sport.

01:29:39.749 --> 01:29:43.294
But first I'm going to grab
us another drink. All right?

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:23.000
You're going to let me go now?

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:24.710
Yeah, of course I will.

01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:27.414
Yeah, I'm going to
let you out of here

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:29.924
and then I'm going to
take you somewhere else.

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:32.378
- Down there.
- No!

01:30:33.637 --> 01:30:37.341
'Cause you see, no one
really gets out of here.

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:40.386
Well, not in one piece, you know.

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:44.055
Figuratively speaking.

01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:57.868
That would just be crazy.

01:30:57.869 --> 01:31:00.447
What the fuck is this?

01:31:03.959 --> 01:31:06.710
You said you were a
man of your word.

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:08.413
I am. I am, mate.

01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:13.585
As I said, you owe me, boy.

01:31:14.803 --> 01:31:16.553
You took away my plaything.

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:21.058
And so, you're just going to
have to stand in for a bit.

01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:22.761
Okey dokey?

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:27.853
No. You're some
fucking faggot freak.

01:31:27.857 --> 01:31:29.233
You...

01:31:30.527 --> 01:31:32.403
Don't you ever fucking say that!

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:35.072
Don't you ever say that!

01:31:35.073 --> 01:31:36.320
Hey!

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:40.744
This will turn you into a woman.

01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:45.291
I didn't mean it like that.

01:31:47.627 --> 01:31:50.296
Hey, Mick.

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.011
It's Don Bradman, bitch.

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:11.108
You'll have to do better than that,

01:32:11.276 --> 01:32:14.229
you Pommy cunt!

01:32:32.964 --> 01:32:36.168
Oi! That really bloody hurt!

01:32:36.426 --> 01:32:38.128
I think you cracked me skull!

01:32:38.511 --> 01:32:41.889
I got claret coming out of me
bloody skull, all over the place!

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:43.432
There's blood everywhere!

01:32:43.433 --> 01:32:46.011
I hope you're happy
with yourself, mate!

01:33:01.618 --> 01:33:05.288
Yeah, I reckon by now you ought
to have found the dead end.

01:33:06.039 --> 01:33:09.163
People have been dying
to get out of here.

01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:15.631
Fuck!

01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:20.636
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>

01:33:21.346 --> 01:33:25.346
<i>The pipes, the pipes are calling</i>

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:28.845
<i>From glen to glen</i>

01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:31.352
<i>And down the mountain side</i>

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:36.566
<i>The summer's gone and
all the flowers are dying</i>

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:43.367
You've got to be fucking joking.

01:34:00.844 --> 01:34:03.262
Here comes Uncle Mick!

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:10.053
Make it stop! Please!

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:12.768
Please, don't leave me!

01:34:13.231 --> 01:34:15.354
I'll come back! I'll come back!

01:34:16.025 --> 01:34:17.522
Please!

01:34:18.945 --> 01:34:21.694
Help me!

01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:21.166
Now, about all them bodies.

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:23.627
They deserved it.

01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:25.302
All of 'em.

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:27.130
Foreign bastards!

01:35:29.807 --> 01:35:32.226
Noxious, bloody weak.

01:35:43.905 --> 01:35:46.858
Somebody's gotta keep
Australia beautiful!

01:35:49.494 --> 01:35:50.695
Fuck!

01:35:58.503 --> 01:36:00.504
We're having such a good time.

01:36:00.505 --> 01:36:04.551
Singing, and drinking,
and carrying on.

01:36:04.676 --> 01:36:06.843
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport</i>

01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:09.429
<i>Tie me kangaroo down
Tie me...</i>

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:11.382
Ah, fuck ya!

01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:13.767
Come on! Come on!

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:17.973
Get out of here! Get him! Go on,
get away up there. Get on him!

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.081
No!

01:36:59.022 --> 01:37:01.398
Come on, mate. Where do
you think you're going?

01:37:01.399 --> 01:37:04.944
I told ya, there's
no way out of here.

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:30.970
Fee-fi-fo-fum

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:34.928
I smell the blood
of a stinkin' Porn!

01:38:07.507 --> 01:38:08.754
Bit rough, ain't it?

01:38:12.387 --> 01:38:15.090
Now, where were we?

01:38:16.349 --> 01:38:18.847
Yeah, that's right.

01:38:20.103 --> 01:38:22.806
You see, in this world,

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:27.318
there's people like me and
there's people like you.

01:38:27.985 --> 01:38:32.531
And people like me eat people
like you for breakfast

01:38:32.532 --> 01:38:34.450
and shit 'em out.

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:39.785
You're nothing but foreign vermin.

01:38:40.289 --> 01:38:43.743
A stinking introduced species.

01:38:44.085 --> 01:38:48.381
And it's up to my kind
to wipe your kind out.

01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:54.178
And that makes me the winner.

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:56.801
Which makes you...

01:40:09.462 --> 01:40:10.879
You got to help me.

01:40:11.672 --> 01:40:12.998
You got to help me.
