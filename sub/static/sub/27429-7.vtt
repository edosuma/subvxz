00:00.080 --> 00:01.909
Previously on Good Trouble...

00:01.910 --> 00:03.149
I want a big traditional wedding.

00:03.150 --> 00:05.189
Why are you doing this?

00:05.190 --> 00:06.569
If I help her plan this wedding,

00:06.570 --> 00:08.729
then I'll be numb to the fact
that she's not marrying me.

00:08.730 --> 00:10.319
I misread all the signals.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.519
Wait. What are you doing?

00:11.520 --> 00:13.319
Gael... just a friend?

00:13.320 --> 00:15.019
I'd just like to know
who I'm up against.

00:15.020 --> 00:17.189
Oh, we are seeing other people.

00:17.190 --> 00:18.899
This thing isn't just casual.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.069
Not for me.

00:20.070 --> 00:22.189
It isn't for me, either.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.279
Davia has been hooking up

00:23.280 --> 00:25.019
with this guy from her hometown.

00:25.020 --> 00:26.279
Did you try my wife?

00:26.280 --> 00:28.400
- He's married, Davia.
- I know.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:44.480 --> 00:45.519
Sorry.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.019
- Hmm.
- Hey.

00:47.020 --> 00:48.070
Hi.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.070
Oh, my God!

00:56.280 --> 00:57.859
What the hell are you doing?

00:57.860 --> 00:59.279
- I was... What?
- Huh?

00:59.280 --> 01:01.149
Are you kidding me?

01:01.150 --> 01:03.979
After everything that I've done for you?

01:03.980 --> 01:07.149
You spineless loser. God, you are...

01:07.150 --> 01:09.779
- I should, I should chop it...
- Whoa!

01:36.280 --> 01:38.109
Other guys are gonna take
you to a nice restaurant,

01:38.110 --> 01:41.109
but I'm gonna take you to a
nice restaurant in a nice suit.

01:41.110 --> 01:43.189
- You know?
- Uh-huh.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.069
So, tell me about yourself.

01:45.070 --> 01:47.519
That's a real broad area there, Paul.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.189
I'm gonna need you to narrow it down.

01:49.190 --> 01:51.229
Do you want food? I can order some apps.

01:51.230 --> 01:53.279
- Sure. I'll get us the menus.
- Yeah. I'll get the menu.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.399
- No, I can do it.
- Oh, I can that.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.479
Do you like movies? What are
your thoughts on astrology?

01:56.480 --> 02:00.229
I'm a Pisces. I don't know
if that means anything to you.

02:00.230 --> 02:01.859
You wanna go halfsies
on the broccolini or...

02:01.860 --> 02:03.610
Oh, I'm allergic to crab cakes.

02:05.070 --> 02:06.189
Have you ever been to Milano?

02:06.190 --> 02:08.149
I'd love to take you there.

02:08.150 --> 02:09.818
What-what would you
call that lip color?

02:09.820 --> 02:11.190
Is that, uh, like a rose?

02:12.320 --> 02:13.609
I'm still down to eat it.

02:13.610 --> 02:16.279
The crab cakes. I...
I just get puffy, yeah.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.319
It looks great on you.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.230
I mean, how cool to watch you
experience that through my eyes.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.689
- No carbs though, right?
- I guess.

02:28.071 --> 02:30.300
_

02:30.400 --> 02:32.880
- Oh. I'll be right back.
- I'll be right back.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.280
Paul? Really?

02:41.650 --> 02:43.279
That's your idea of a sex machine?

02:43.280 --> 02:45.069
He buys his pants at Costco.

02:45.070 --> 02:47.149
Yeah, well, how do you know that?

02:47.150 --> 02:48.479
'Cause he told me.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.649
That's the most interesting
thing he's said so far.

02:50.650 --> 02:53.229
Okay, well, my date is as
deep as a puddle. Alice?

02:53.230 --> 02:54.689
He had worshipful eyes.

02:54.690 --> 02:56.439
Maybe because he was
looking in a mirror.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.649
Seriously, if I had a
drink every time he started

02:58.650 --> 03:00.729
a sentence with the word
"I," I would be hammered.

03:00.730 --> 03:03.569
So, get hammered and bang him.

03:03.570 --> 03:06.279
Easy for you to say, you
bailed on this experiment.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.399
- Oh, he's cute.
- "I like my women like I like my coffee,

03:09.400 --> 03:11.859
black and bitter." No.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.939
Sorry, I did not see that.

03:13.940 --> 03:16.109
Don't worry about it. I got this.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.359
Hey, you worry about Alice.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.359
No, don't worry about Alice.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.519
Alice is fine with no date.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.019
Okay, Alice would rather
deep-fry her own hand.

03:23.020 --> 03:25.149
Look, I'm not just
gonna find you a date.

03:25.150 --> 03:26.819
Ooh, I am going to find you someone

03:26.820 --> 03:29.279
who makes you forget Sumi ever existed.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.280
What are you guys doing?

03:30.281 --> 03:32.359
Your sister had the inspired idea

03:32.360 --> 03:34.019
that we should pick dates for each other

03:34.020 --> 03:35.359
on the Shyppr app.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.979
- Oh.
- We all need to get laid.

03:36.980 --> 03:39.399
- Yeah.
- Even though I already have a man.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.939
Uh, your man canceled his
trip to LA this weekend.

03:40.940 --> 03:42.279
And your man has a wife.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.439
Do you really wanna antagonize me

03:44.440 --> 03:47.519
when I hold the fate of
your love life in my hands?

03:47.520 --> 03:50.399
Oh, and FYI, Mariana,
since I have someone

03:50.400 --> 03:53.819
who checks all my boxes, I'm
just looking for a sex machine.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.319
- On it.
- Mariana.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.019
What about a guy that has a cat?

03:57.085 --> 03:58.794
- That's fine.
- How about six cats?

03:58.795 --> 04:01.754
Oh, hello, Isaac.

04:01.755 --> 04:06.385
- Hot, athletic, runs his own business.
- Ooh.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.294
Oh, wait a minute. I
think I might have seen him

04:10.295 --> 04:12.384
- in the neighborhood.
- Maybe.

04:12.385 --> 04:13.634
Says he lives in Downtown LA.

04:13.635 --> 04:15.344
But I might save him for myself.

04:15.345 --> 04:16.673
Oh, too late.

04:16.675 --> 04:18.004
- So rude.
- Argh!

04:18.005 --> 04:20.504
We would swipe for you, Callie,

04:20.505 --> 04:22.294
but with two guys already,
you've got your hands full.

04:22.295 --> 04:26.005
Out of curiosity, exactly how full?

04:27.175 --> 04:29.634
- Davia...
- What is wrong with you?

04:29.635 --> 04:31.634
- We all wanna know.
- No, I don't wanna know.

04:31.635 --> 04:33.584
No, I'm not seeing anyone this weekend.

04:33.585 --> 04:36.504
Rebecca passed the bar and
she is rubbing it in our faces.

04:36.505 --> 04:38.004
So, I have to study.

04:39.505 --> 04:40.674
Oh, my God.

04:42.175 --> 04:46.134
So, I'm proposing we make a pact.

04:46.135 --> 04:48.504
- Hmm.
- I have to pass the bar,

04:48.505 --> 04:52.255
and you need to work on your
new pieces for your show, so...

04:53.505 --> 04:55.344
no seeing each other this weekend.

04:55.345 --> 04:58.045
- No sex.
- No Superman?

04:59.465 --> 05:00.465
Clark Kent?

05:02.345 --> 05:03.544
Jamie?

05:03.545 --> 05:05.844
He does not look like Clark Kent.

05:05.845 --> 05:08.425
Just picture him with glasses on.

05:10.795 --> 05:12.465
Yeah, maybe a little.

05:16.215 --> 05:17.675
So have you heard from him?

05:20.545 --> 05:22.045
Have you heard from Bryan?

05:26.385 --> 05:28.424
- So this weekend...
- Deal.

05:28.425 --> 05:32.344
We'll hole ourselves up in
our lofts, get our shit done,

05:32.345 --> 05:34.174
put you completely out of my mind.

05:34.175 --> 05:36.084
Am I that easy to forget?

05:36.085 --> 05:37.844
I mean, I may not be the Man of Steel,

05:37.845 --> 05:39.425
but I can be disciplined.

05:40.385 --> 05:42.845
I once went a whole day
without checking Twitter.

05:44.045 --> 05:45.504
That's so impressive.

05:45.505 --> 05:47.345
I also deleted Facebook.

05:48.465 --> 05:49.885
That is so hot.

05:50.945 --> 05:54.265
Looks like you're the one who's
gonna suffer withdrawal this weekend.

05:56.345 --> 05:59.134
I think I'll survive.

05:59.135 --> 06:00.545
Yeah?

06:04.965 --> 06:06.845
I beg to differ.

06:08.045 --> 06:10.634
My hair's always gonna
look better than yours.

06:10.635 --> 06:12.134
... and then we moved to New Mexico.

06:12.135 --> 06:14.004
Uh, you ever had a sopapilla?

06:14.005 --> 06:15.674
My mom's always like,

06:15.675 --> 06:18.924
"Why you no do rocket surgery?"

06:18.925 --> 06:23.384
Man, Coterie Shyppr Theater's
not nearly as wild as I wanted.

06:23.385 --> 06:25.674
Oh, girl, that's 'cause
I wasn't involved.

06:25.675 --> 06:27.344
What happened to that
writer guy you were seeing?

06:27.345 --> 06:29.544
Man, he tried to pull that
white savior crap on me.

06:29.545 --> 06:32.754
Don't he know? I'm
working on a PhD, bitch.

06:32.755 --> 06:34.634
Anyone who looks at you
and thinks you need saving

06:34.635 --> 06:36.465
- can kiss my black ass.
- Thank you.

06:37.425 --> 06:40.584
- Uh... hello.
- Oh, hay-llo!

06:40.585 --> 06:42.925
- I would swipe hella right on that.
- Mm-hmm.

06:45.135 --> 06:48.004
I did. And he clearly
did not swipe right on me.

06:48.005 --> 06:49.545
- For real?
- Yep.

06:50.295 --> 06:51.464
Okay, now, this is getting good.

06:51.465 --> 06:52.465
Mm-hmm. Whatcha gonna do?

06:52.466 --> 06:54.174
Same thing he did to me.

06:54.175 --> 06:55.964
- Ignore him.
- Okay.

06:55.965 --> 06:57.464
Oh, hey, queen.

06:57.465 --> 06:59.045
- Live your best life.
- Mm-mm.

06:59.505 --> 07:00.584
- Mm.
- Mm-mm.

07:00.585 --> 07:02.464
- Mm-mm. Take it back.
- Aah! That's hot.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.924
Look, I know I may seem intimidating,

07:04.925 --> 07:07.174
but I put my pants on two legs at a time

07:07.175 --> 07:08.634
just like everyone else.

07:13.585 --> 07:15.084
Sorry. What were you saying?

07:15.085 --> 07:16.465
I was talking about my pants.

07:18.085 --> 07:19.175
Right.

07:20.135 --> 07:21.504
Tell me more.

07:25.425 --> 07:26.635
Need help?

07:48.925 --> 07:50.585
Cooling off or looking for snacks?

07:52.925 --> 07:54.255
All of the above.

07:54.965 --> 07:56.714
How's the studying going?

07:56.715 --> 07:59.425
You know, getting organized.

08:00.085 --> 08:01.754
How's the arting going?

08:01.755 --> 08:03.385
Uh, you know, getting organized.

08:06.045 --> 08:07.465
Anything good to eat in there?

08:08.755 --> 08:10.295
Nothing.

08:12.385 --> 08:15.255
There's a food truck fest
a few blocks from here.

08:16.715 --> 08:18.084
We gotta eat, right?

08:25.425 --> 08:26.425
Excuse me?

08:31.345 --> 08:33.465
So, this is happening, huh?

08:34.085 --> 08:35.635
Sorry.

08:38.215 --> 08:39.583
Have a good night.

08:39.585 --> 08:42.544
Uh, Coterie romances
never end well, guys.

08:42.544 --> 08:43.544
Trust me.

08:46.255 --> 08:48.174
I really have to study.

08:48.175 --> 08:49.675
Yeah, I really have to work.

08:54.175 --> 08:57.134
See, now that guy is a
problem with these apps.

08:57.135 --> 08:59.844
He sees a dark face and
automatically swipes left.

08:59.845 --> 09:02.084
And if they don't, they won't
let you be a whole person.

09:02.085 --> 09:05.884
Right. Like, why can't I
have a PhD and big-ass booty?

09:05.885 --> 09:08.004
Well, because according
to society and those apps,

09:08.005 --> 09:09.584
we're either struggling subhumans

09:09.585 --> 09:11.584
- or hypersexulaized freaks.
- Mm-hmm. Preach.

09:11.585 --> 09:14.794
The apps aren't all that
bad. I did meet Anton online.

09:14.795 --> 09:16.965
- We know!
- We know!

09:17.965 --> 09:19.204
Mm-hmm. That's right.

09:19.205 --> 09:21.794
You keep on waiting over
there with your nice shoulders.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.844
How dare you swipe left on my girl?

09:23.845 --> 09:25.044
You think you all that, I got a...

09:25.045 --> 09:26.545
Oh, shit. Here he come.

09:28.966 --> 09:30.634
Uh, excuse me.

09:30.635 --> 09:32.634
Uh, you think it's possible
we could order some drinks?

09:32.635 --> 09:34.504
Me and my friend, we've
been here for a minute.

09:34.505 --> 09:36.794
I'm so sorry. I must
have overlooked you.

09:36.795 --> 09:38.464
I'll be right over.

09:38.465 --> 09:39.675
- Appreciate it.
- Mm-hmm.

09:43.675 --> 09:45.424
So Dave Matthews isn't
your favorite band?

09:45.425 --> 09:47.254
No.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.004
I put that ironically.

09:49.005 --> 09:52.844
No one under 40's favorite
band is Dave Matthews.

09:52.845 --> 09:54.134
Mine is.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.294
- Well...
- Did you think I was being ironic too?

09:56.295 --> 09:57.844
Is that why you... you picked me?

09:57.845 --> 09:59.505
- 'Cause I wasn't sure...
- Okay.

10:00.175 --> 10:01.505
Full disclosure, Paul?

10:02.425 --> 10:04.174
I didn't pick you.

10:04.175 --> 10:05.635
This was a bit of an experiment.

10:06.925 --> 10:08.844
That automatic flushing toilet

10:08.845 --> 10:11.844
splashed up in places
I never gave permission.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.714
- You never know. That's enough.
- Oh. What are...

10:13.715 --> 10:15.044
Come on. What are you doing?

10:15.045 --> 10:16.634
You're sweet to laugh, but it's dumb.

10:16.635 --> 10:19.254
No. You're like legit funny.

10:19.255 --> 10:21.794
You should come be a
guest on my radio show.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.424
- You have a radio show?
- Yeah.

10:23.425 --> 10:25.714
We live stream on Sunday mornings.

10:25.715 --> 10:29.004
- Wow.
- We have like 11 listeners, but they're devoted.

10:29.005 --> 10:31.674
Cool. I mean, is it
like a talk show or...

10:31.675 --> 10:33.714
It's like whatever I want it to be.

10:33.715 --> 10:36.844
Uh, sometimes I play
music that makes me cry

10:36.845 --> 10:38.464
or a lot of lady disco.

10:38.465 --> 10:40.344
Uh, one hour I just played the sounds

10:40.345 --> 10:42.345
of white girls ordering brunch.

10:43.345 --> 10:45.384
Yeah. I just talk about
random stuff that happen to me.

10:45.385 --> 10:46.795
Like bad dates?

10:48.135 --> 10:49.635
This is not a bad date.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.795
- At all.
- Yeah?

10:53.585 --> 10:55.424
I'm having a good time.

10:55.425 --> 10:56.884
Me too.

10:56.885 --> 11:00.134
I've been to The Broad, The
Grove, The Hollywood Bowl,

11:00.135 --> 11:02.504
all the "The's" of LA, really.

11:02.505 --> 11:04.384
Have you done Runyon yet?

11:04.385 --> 11:06.795
It's the place to get your body tight.

11:07.675 --> 11:08.845
You get it?

11:09.425 --> 11:11.754
Yeah, yeah. I see what you did there.

11:11.755 --> 11:12.845
Yeah.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.084
Anything else?

11:21.085 --> 11:23.005
Yes. Uh, how about your name?

11:24.295 --> 11:26.084
You'll have to forgive my friend.

11:26.085 --> 11:28.544
He gets all his game from
Jennifer Lopez movies.

11:28.545 --> 11:30.344
- Well...
- We talking Enough J.Lo

11:30.345 --> 11:32.424
- or The Wedding Planner J.Lo?
- Ooh.

11:32.425 --> 11:35.964
Oh, I'm more of a Kate Hudson
guy to be all the way real.

11:35.965 --> 11:37.714
Uh-huh. So we're good here?

11:37.715 --> 11:40.005
Yeah, we're outta here
after this one. Thank you.

11:40.635 --> 11:42.755
Oh, I still ain't get your name.

11:43.505 --> 11:44.844
Ooh!

11:44.845 --> 11:46.844
Girl, he wants you bad.

11:46.845 --> 11:49.005
- He's a player.
- Well, I say game on.

11:49.885 --> 11:50.924
Play his ass back.

11:50.925 --> 11:53.385
Yes. Give him a taste
of his own medicine.

11:56.885 --> 11:58.884
Hey, uh, you wanna
head back home with me?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.795
I'd love to show you my portfolio.

12:01.795 --> 12:04.754
Hey, babe, I am so sorry.

12:04.755 --> 12:06.634
I know that I promised
to give you space,

12:06.635 --> 12:08.004
but I really need to talk to you.

12:08.005 --> 12:09.174
Yo, bro. Do you mind?

12:09.175 --> 12:10.964
Hey. Uh, yeah, no.
This'll just take a second.

12:10.965 --> 12:15.634
Uh, look, I know that I might
not have better hair than you

12:15.635 --> 12:18.924
or take you out to nice
restaurants in a nice suit,

12:18.925 --> 12:22.424
but I would do anything to get you back

12:22.425 --> 12:24.715
if you'll just give me one more chance.

12:29.795 --> 12:31.714
Wow. Um...

12:31.715 --> 12:34.005
Um, sorry. Uh...

12:35.175 --> 12:36.794
I'll tell you what, I am
gonna go wait by the bar

12:36.795 --> 12:38.215
just in case you wanna talk,

12:39.135 --> 12:42.294
or if you wanna leave with
this guy, totally get it.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.084
I mean, his shoes are sick.

12:44.085 --> 12:45.545
Thanks, man, they're Berluti.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.715
Berluti.

12:51.505 --> 12:55.135
Look, I believe in a
woman's right to choose.

12:56.295 --> 12:58.925
It's up to you if want
the Prius or the Tesla.

12:59.635 --> 13:01.544
I mean, they're both gonna
get you to where you wanna go,

13:01.545 --> 13:03.884
it's just one's gonna
care a little bit more

13:03.885 --> 13:05.795
about how you look getting there.

13:07.085 --> 13:09.844
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
go check on that Prius.

13:09.845 --> 13:12.424
But... it's been real.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.505
Okay.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.924
So you're clearly not the
class act I thought you were.

13:16.925 --> 13:18.135
Peace out.

13:54.045 --> 13:56.384
_

13:56.385 --> 13:59.295
_

13:59.296 --> 14:00.396
_

14:04.885 --> 14:06.214
I'm good.

14:08.295 --> 14:10.134
Are you?

14:10.135 --> 14:12.215
You've had your worried
face on all night.

14:13.715 --> 14:14.965
Just worried about work.

14:17.045 --> 14:19.084
No, that face is more pointy.

14:19.085 --> 14:21.795
This is your sad, worried face.

14:22.385 --> 14:23.885
You analyze my faces?

14:24.255 --> 14:25.675
I love your faces.

14:26.675 --> 14:28.345
Hangry face is top three.

14:29.345 --> 14:30.925
God, I hate you.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.295
Okay.

14:39.885 --> 14:42.255
Well, I thought I could do
this casual thing with you.

14:44.045 --> 14:47.005
I... I've never wanted to
be with just one person.

14:47.795 --> 14:50.175
But I care about you a lot.

14:52.385 --> 14:54.175
And I don't wanna share you with anyone.

14:58.795 --> 15:00.215
You don't have to answer right now.

15:02.175 --> 15:03.885
You can think about it.

15:06.345 --> 15:07.345
Okay.

15:12.146 --> 15:14.546
_

15:44.385 --> 15:45.504
I was hot.

15:45.505 --> 15:46.675
Mm-hmm.

15:47.885 --> 15:49.425
I needed to cool off.

15:51.135 --> 15:52.844
So, not hot anymore?

15:52.845 --> 15:53.925
No.

15:54.255 --> 15:55.925
Nice and cool.

15:56.965 --> 15:57.965
Okay.

16:06.585 --> 16:07.964
- Right over here.
- Okay.

16:07.965 --> 16:09.424
- Watch your feet.
- Oh, all right.

16:09.425 --> 16:10.465
Oh, shoot.

16:11.295 --> 16:12.295
Sorry.

16:12.296 --> 16:13.634
I wasn't expecting company.

16:13.635 --> 16:15.215
It's okay.

16:18.255 --> 16:19.585
This place is sexy.

16:20.545 --> 16:21.754
Sexy?

16:21.755 --> 16:23.084
- Uh...
- Yeah.

16:23.085 --> 16:26.215
- You... you think so?
- So are you.

16:40.345 --> 16:43.045
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.175
Uh, that was like my worst kiss ever.

16:46.465 --> 16:49.254
I just haven't dated anyone in years,

16:49.255 --> 16:52.174
and I've definitely never
dated anyone like me.

16:52.175 --> 16:53.215
It's okay.

16:54.135 --> 16:55.254
I get it.

16:55.255 --> 16:57.505
No. Uh, I don't want
you to get it. Uh...

16:58.425 --> 16:59.504
I can... I can do better.

16:59.505 --> 17:01.384
- Okay.
- Watch.

17:01.385 --> 17:02.924
Mm.

17:14.005 --> 17:15.674
You're telling me you went to MIT?

17:15.675 --> 17:17.884
- Yeah.
- Wow.

17:17.885 --> 17:19.964
See, you know what your problem is?

17:19.964 --> 17:22.134
You are a beautiful,
brilliant and funny woman

17:22.135 --> 17:24.003
and you are insanely intimidating.

17:24.005 --> 17:27.174
But I put my pants
on two legs at a time.

17:29.055 --> 17:30.594
See? Funny.

17:30.595 --> 17:32.305
I mean, what guy wouldn't worship you?

17:34.095 --> 17:36.844
Every great rom-com
ends with a chase, facts.

17:36.845 --> 17:39.174
You're trippin'. Pretty
Woman, racing in a limo*

17:39.175 --> 17:40.924
to catch her before she leaves town.

17:40.925 --> 17:43.094
Brown Sugar, rushing
to the radio station.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.674
When Harry Met Sally, running through

17:44.675 --> 17:46.464
the New York City streets
to get a New Year's kiss.

17:46.465 --> 17:48.595
It's not the chase, it's the gesture.

17:49.425 --> 17:51.924
Say Anything, The Best Man.

17:51.925 --> 17:53.884
And Richard Gere was afraid of heights,

17:53.885 --> 17:55.134
and climbed the fire escape for her.

17:55.135 --> 17:57.004
Okay, okay, but I would argue with you

17:57.005 --> 17:58.424
that a gesture is a chase in itself,

17:58.425 --> 18:01.554
so therefore, every great
rom-com ends with a chase, facts.

18:01.555 --> 18:04.214
Severely flawed logic,
and you are still wrong.

18:04.215 --> 18:06.554
My favorite movie ends with
neither a chase nor a gesture.

18:06.555 --> 18:07.884
Which one's that?

18:07.885 --> 18:09.054
I'm not telling you. Figure it out.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.135
Ooh. Can I get a clue?

18:13.465 --> 18:15.384
- The couple dated in real life.
- Yes.

18:15.385 --> 18:19.305
It takes place in LA, and...

18:20.505 --> 18:23.175
it has one of the sexiest
scenes I've ever seen.

18:34.265 --> 18:35.265
Mm.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.554
I would have never guessed
Alice would be the first one

18:37.555 --> 18:38.844
to leave with her date.

18:38.845 --> 18:39.924
Good on her.

18:39.925 --> 18:41.055
I would've guessed you.

18:42.215 --> 18:44.214
Are you calling me a slut?

18:44.215 --> 18:46.384
No. No, no, no. Hell, no. No.

18:46.385 --> 18:48.054
You're lovely. I mean, you're nice. No.

18:48.055 --> 18:49.594
No, I'm just saying...

18:49.595 --> 18:51.344
'cause you're so confident

18:51.345 --> 18:52.844
and adventurous, you know what I mean?

18:52.845 --> 18:54.634
I'm sure if you were here
with a guy better than me...

18:54.635 --> 18:56.005
That, Paul, is your problem.

18:56.885 --> 19:01.134
Not your too short pants
or your love of jam bands,

19:01.135 --> 19:03.054
but your lack of self-confidence.

19:03.055 --> 19:04.634
We're gonna fix it. Come on.

19:04.635 --> 19:05.674
Come here.

19:05.675 --> 19:07.554
We're gonna rebrand you.

19:07.555 --> 19:09.924
- Hey.
- Gonna "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" this.

19:09.925 --> 19:11.555
- Bibbidi-Bobbidi-what?
- Mm-hmm.

19:13.305 --> 19:14.845
Okay, what's your Insta handle?

19:15.305 --> 19:16.385
Don't have one.

19:17.135 --> 19:18.175
- Twitter?
- Nope.

19:18.845 --> 19:20.465
Facebook?

19:21.965 --> 19:23.175
Oh, no.

19:24.265 --> 19:26.174
Oh, no, it's worse than I thought.

19:26.175 --> 19:28.496
Quotes? Paul, you have
pictures of quotes.

19:29.505 --> 19:31.134
What do you want me to
post, my tax returns?

19:31.135 --> 19:32.304
No. Okay, okay. Here, here, here.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.764
Look at mine.

19:33.765 --> 19:35.174
Funny videos.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.964
Pictures with friends.

19:36.965 --> 19:38.714
You do have friends, right?

19:38.715 --> 19:40.425
- Yes.
- Okay, I'm just asking.

19:42.765 --> 19:43.765
Hmm.

19:44.925 --> 19:46.005
Hmm.

19:46.385 --> 19:47.844
- What?
- One second.

19:47.845 --> 19:49.004
I already have a man.

19:49.005 --> 19:51.005
Uh, your man canceled his
trip to LA this weekend.

19:59.305 --> 20:00.425
Okay?

20:04.765 --> 20:07.464
Last call. You want anything else?

20:07.465 --> 20:10.175
Sure. Your number, please?

20:11.215 --> 20:12.425
Yeah, I don't think so.

20:13.925 --> 20:15.174
Really?

20:15.175 --> 20:18.264
You remember when you
swiped left on this?

20:18.265 --> 20:20.384
Big mistake.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.385
Huge.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.964
W... wait a minute, Pretty Woman.

20:22.965 --> 20:24.464
Wh... What are you talking about?

20:24.465 --> 20:25.594
You're on Shyppr.

20:25.595 --> 20:27.674
I swiped right on you,
and yet we never matched

20:27.675 --> 20:29.094
because you didn't think I was worthy.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.634
I would've never swiped
left one you, nope.

20:31.635 --> 20:34.345
I bet none of the matches
on your phone look like me.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.464
Oh. Let's see.

20:37.465 --> 20:39.344
- You wanna see?
- Yeah.

20:39.345 --> 20:40.465
Okay.

20:41.505 --> 20:42.765
All right.

20:43.765 --> 20:45.635
- Well, she...
- No, no.

20:46.635 --> 20:47.635
Uh-huh.

20:49.505 --> 20:51.345
- Hold on. Let me just...
- Mm-hmm.

20:55.465 --> 20:58.054
You said it yourself, you're
more of a Kate Hudson guy.

20:58.055 --> 20:59.384
Wait. Hold on. This is not really...

20:59.385 --> 21:01.175
You seem like a nice guy, but...

21:02.425 --> 21:03.884
I just don't feel right
giving my number to somebody

21:03.885 --> 21:06.554
who subconsciously or not
wrote me off without a thought.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.265
That's everything.

21:21.635 --> 21:23.345
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.055
Wow.

21:25.505 --> 21:27.384
- You have a great place.
- Thank you.

21:27.385 --> 21:29.845
Uh, make yourself at home.
I will get some drinks.

21:30.175 --> 21:32.424
- Hey, babe. Hi.
- Hi! Hi.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.764
- How are you?
- Good.

21:33.765 --> 21:35.844
Good. Uh, this is Mariana.

21:35.845 --> 21:38.424
- Hi, I'm Lara. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

21:38.425 --> 21:40.554
- I'm so glad you came over.
- Yeah, me too.

21:40.555 --> 21:41.714
- Right?
- Yeah.

21:41.715 --> 21:44.304
So we stopped off in this
little town in Austria,

21:44.305 --> 21:46.344
and I found the best hangover cure ever.

21:46.345 --> 21:48.304
Cucumber, butter, and salami sandwiches?

21:48.305 --> 21:50.464
- Yes! oh, my God.
- Yes, right? I know.

21:50.465 --> 21:53.134
I love Austria. My girlfriend and I,

21:53.135 --> 21:54.655
we're actually going back next summer.

21:55.305 --> 21:57.005
- Oh, your girlfriend.
- Mm-hmm.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.004
Makes sense. All the
good ones are taken.

22:00.005 --> 22:02.464
Well, not all of them.

22:03.635 --> 22:04.765
Oh.

22:05.265 --> 22:06.385
Speaking of...

22:08.305 --> 22:09.885
Hey, babe, how was girls' night?

22:10.925 --> 22:12.805
Yeah, no, all the guys bailed early too.

22:14.175 --> 22:17.345
I am at the bar having a drink
with the very lovely, Mariana.

22:17.765 --> 22:19.964
Yeah, no, she's cute, smart, funny,

22:19.965 --> 22:21.305
not an actress.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.855
Why don't you come
down here and join us?

22:25.765 --> 22:27.714
Oh, yeah, that's...

22:27.715 --> 22:29.714
Said she's already in
her PJs, but wants to know

22:29.715 --> 22:31.635
if you wanna come to our
place and have a drink.

22:38.385 --> 22:39.675
Are you coming or not?

22:43.805 --> 22:45.645
Oh, this is a, uh...
It's a really nice place.

22:46.215 --> 22:47.554
Thanks, Paul, but we're
done with the niceties.

22:47.555 --> 22:48.715
You wanna do this?

22:49.885 --> 22:50.925
Oh, yeah.

22:51.555 --> 22:52.555
Ooh.

22:53.465 --> 22:54.964
Hey.

22:54.965 --> 22:56.504
Yeah.

23:01.135 --> 23:03.095
Sorry, we're closed.

23:05.885 --> 23:06.885
Hey.

23:09.135 --> 23:11.675
- What are you doing?
- Love & Basketball.

23:12.465 --> 23:14.384
It's your favorite movie, right?

23:14.385 --> 23:15.385
Yeah.

23:18.305 --> 23:20.345
I'm... I'm so sorry I overlooked you.

23:22.265 --> 23:24.765
Straight up, I... I'm an idiot.

23:25.635 --> 23:26.805
Uh-huh.

23:28.465 --> 23:29.504
You know, maybe next time,

23:29.505 --> 23:30.905
open your mind to the whole person,

23:31.965 --> 23:33.345
you might make a real connection.

23:34.175 --> 23:35.465
What if I have?

23:38.345 --> 23:39.504
Come on, let's...

23:39.505 --> 23:40.715
One on one.

23:41.505 --> 23:43.804
If I win, I get to
take you out on a date.

23:43.805 --> 23:45.425
If you win...

23:46.055 --> 23:49.005
well, me and my broke heart will
never step foot in your place again.

23:51.715 --> 23:52.845
Hmm?

23:55.765 --> 23:57.264
You play for the pros?

23:57.265 --> 23:58.265
No.

23:59.595 --> 24:00.925
Not anymore.

24:03.595 --> 24:06.504
I don't even have the energy
to work on stuff of my own

24:06.505 --> 24:09.264
because Speckulate has just
drained me of all creativity.

24:09.265 --> 24:11.844
Mariana, you are way too special

24:11.845 --> 24:14.464
to let a bunch of bros
screw with your mojo.

24:14.465 --> 24:15.554
Yeah.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.384
Already screwed.

24:17.385 --> 24:19.504
And the only screwing
I've been doing lately.

24:19.505 --> 24:20.844
It is settled.

24:20.845 --> 24:22.464
I am going to fix you up.

24:22.465 --> 24:25.214
- Don't say... Oh, God. No.
- Yes, I am.

24:25.215 --> 24:26.344
You don't understand.

24:26.345 --> 24:27.964
Every time that she
tries to play matchmaker,

24:27.965 --> 24:29.344
we end up losing a friend.

24:29.345 --> 24:30.714
Okay, not true.

24:30.715 --> 24:33.504
And that's because we haven't
had such a great catch before.

24:33.505 --> 24:35.135
That may be true.

24:35.555 --> 24:37.464
Aww. You guys are adorable.

24:37.465 --> 24:38.634
Total relationship goals.

24:38.635 --> 24:40.924
Yeah, we try.

24:43.925 --> 24:45.634
Well, you know, I should go.

24:45.635 --> 24:47.094
- Leave you lovebirds alone.
- Oh.

24:47.095 --> 24:48.384
No, please stay.

24:48.385 --> 24:49.764
We're sick of each other, right?

24:49.765 --> 24:51.054
Yeah, it's true.

24:51.055 --> 24:53.174
And we kind of happen to love you.

24:53.175 --> 24:54.424
You're amazing.

24:54.425 --> 24:56.265
Aww. I love you guys.

24:57.055 --> 24:59.264
And thank you for saving my night.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.634
- Of course, it's our pleasure.
- Glad I met you.

25:01.635 --> 25:02.635
Cheers.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.174
Ah, look. What's up?

25:33.095 --> 25:34.424
Come on.

25:34.425 --> 25:35.465
Aah, damn.

25:37.805 --> 25:39.095
Two, zip.

25:40.385 --> 25:42.214
That was lucky.

25:42.215 --> 25:44.015
Well, maybe, or you're
just going easy on me.

25:45.135 --> 25:47.635
So you want this date or not?

25:49.595 --> 25:50.595
Check.

25:51.595 --> 25:52.635
Okay.

26:00.345 --> 26:01.674
I like Italian food.

26:02.676 --> 26:03.715
Bring it.

26:04.385 --> 26:07.304
Hey, hon, I really like Mariana.

26:07.305 --> 26:08.594
Can we keep her?

26:08.595 --> 26:10.965
I'd say we can do
whatever you want, babe.

26:11.505 --> 26:12.634
Oh.

26:12.635 --> 26:15.305
Well, what do you want, Mariana?

27:32.715 --> 27:33.885
Is everything okay?

27:35.385 --> 27:36.925
Yeah, it's perfect.

28:06.095 --> 28:08.594
It's okay. Go get some.

28:36.305 --> 28:37.805
Come on, what you waiting on?

28:39.845 --> 28:41.595
- Game point.
- Check it.

28:46.675 --> 28:47.675
Time.

28:57.265 --> 28:59.816
- Really?
- Well, all's fair in love and basketball.

29:05.135 --> 29:06.925
- Stop. Stop.
- What?

29:08.885 --> 29:10.424
No. There. Come on.

29:10.425 --> 29:11.965
Okay.

29:13.215 --> 29:14.384
Sorry. Was that too much or...

29:14.385 --> 29:16.555
Oh, my God. Paul, shut up and take me.

29:17.265 --> 29:18.384
- Sorry...
- Oh, my God.

29:18.385 --> 29:19.945
It's okay, just keep going. Don't stop.

29:46.305 --> 29:47.805
Do you need to get that?

29:48.465 --> 29:50.214
Get what?

29:50.215 --> 29:51.555
Oh.

29:51.845 --> 29:53.464
Um, who... who is it?

29:53.465 --> 29:54.765
Sumi.

29:55.965 --> 29:57.344
Oh.

29:57.345 --> 29:58.505
Okay.

30:00.715 --> 30:01.925
- One second.
- Okay.

30:04.005 --> 30:05.804
I'm sorry, I know it's late.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.805
I got in a huge fight with Meera.

30:09.265 --> 30:10.675
She called off the wedding.

30:15.845 --> 30:17.095
Oh...

30:17.965 --> 30:19.805
I don't know what to do.

30:21.005 --> 30:23.675
I can't be alone tonight.
Can I please come in?

30:25.465 --> 30:26.675
Uh...

30:29.135 --> 30:30.464
Oh.

30:30.465 --> 30:33.424
I'm so sorry. I'm... I mean...

30:33.425 --> 30:36.805
No, yeah, I'm so sorry
that you're upset, but I...

30:37.505 --> 30:39.425
I can't be there for you tonight.

30:40.635 --> 30:41.765
I have company.

30:44.425 --> 30:45.555
Okay.

30:46.425 --> 30:47.715
I understand.

30:56.715 --> 30:58.635
Are you okay?

31:01.465 --> 31:03.054
Yeah.

31:03.055 --> 31:05.465
Uh... yeah.

31:37.186 --> 31:40.200
_

31:41.676 --> 31:44.676
_

31:52.595 --> 31:53.805
Hmm.

32:02.175 --> 32:03.715
_

32:20.805 --> 32:22.005
Where have you been all night?

32:23.305 --> 32:24.845
Out with some friends.

32:27.465 --> 32:28.595
A couple.

32:29.005 --> 32:30.005
I spent the night.

32:31.305 --> 32:33.134
- Okay, I had a threesome.
- What?

32:33.135 --> 32:34.425
I know.

32:35.005 --> 32:36.005
I warned you about that dress.

32:36.006 --> 32:38.885
It wasn't the dress, it was me.

32:39.885 --> 32:43.175
I'm just... I felt so rejected
ever since we moved to LA and...

32:43.805 --> 32:45.845
and you get to be the center
of someone's attention.

32:46.505 --> 32:47.714
And I was.

32:47.715 --> 32:48.965
They were all about me.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.304
Except in the morning,
the girlfriend went postal.

32:52.305 --> 32:53.804
Oh, my God!

32:53.805 --> 32:55.804
What the hell are you doing?

32:55.805 --> 32:57.384
I was... What?

32:57.385 --> 32:58.964
I was half asleep. I don't know.

32:58.965 --> 33:01.094
- Where were you?
- Getting dressed for work!

33:01.095 --> 33:03.004
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
What's going on?

33:03.005 --> 33:05.504
I thought we were friends.
How could you do this to me?

33:05.505 --> 33:08.004
We are friends. Uh...
What about last night? I...

33:08.005 --> 33:10.054
No, we only do this together.

33:10.055 --> 33:11.094
- She didn't know.
- Yeah.

33:11.095 --> 33:13.134
You know the rules. Are you kidding me?

33:13.135 --> 33:14.594
I'm new to this, I don't know the rules.

33:14.595 --> 33:16.004
- Okay, well, get out.
- Got it.

33:16.005 --> 33:18.165
- Okay, you don't...
- Maybe move a little faster.

33:19.175 --> 33:21.924
Ugh. Why is it so hard to find
a nice couple in this town?

33:24.005 --> 33:25.055
How was your night?

33:26.635 --> 33:27.925
It was fine.

33:34.425 --> 33:35.634
You okay?

33:42.135 --> 33:43.265
What are we doing?

33:44.215 --> 33:45.215
You mean...

33:47.465 --> 33:52.214
I'm never gonna pass the bar
if I'm up here every night.

33:52.215 --> 33:54.674
Yes, you will. You're just stressed.

33:54.675 --> 33:56.214
I know.

33:56.215 --> 33:58.844
'Cause I'm way behind where I should be.

33:58.845 --> 34:00.504
You're not stressed about finishing

34:00.505 --> 34:02.054
the pieces for your show?

34:02.055 --> 34:03.964
We still have tomorrow.

34:03.965 --> 34:05.965
Yeah, and we'll probably
still be screwing around.

34:06.425 --> 34:09.214
Distracting each other. Like, this
is my career on the line, you know.

34:09.215 --> 34:12.174
And my art is just a hobby?

34:12.175 --> 34:13.384
That's not what I meant.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.134
I was working before you came up here.

34:15.135 --> 34:16.135
Really? Were you?

34:17.715 --> 34:19.214
If you really wanted it that much,

34:19.215 --> 34:20.804
then you wouldn't let
anything get in your way.

34:20.804 --> 34:22.464
I could say the same for you.

34:22.465 --> 34:23.844
All I'm saying is,

34:23.844 --> 34:25.884
you chose to take the
full-time job at Speckulate

34:25.885 --> 34:27.965
and maybe you just don't
really wanna be an artist.

34:29.505 --> 34:31.964
And maybe you don't
wanna be a lawyer, Callie.

34:31.965 --> 34:35.135
'Cause all you do is
complain about your job.

34:36.505 --> 34:37.625
Maybe you just can't cut it.

35:07.715 --> 35:09.175
Where are you?

35:10.465 --> 35:11.885
I'm right here.

35:12.595 --> 35:14.054
Hmm.

35:14.055 --> 35:15.055
No, you're not.

35:24.215 --> 35:25.464
Thank you.

35:25.465 --> 35:27.175
Yeah, it's okay. Come in.

35:28.425 --> 35:30.215
Who was that girl?

35:30.635 --> 35:32.435
- She's just...
- I don't wanna know actually.

35:33.175 --> 35:34.595
It's too weird.

35:35.845 --> 35:37.055
Really?

35:40.465 --> 35:42.385
Meera said that...

35:42.885 --> 35:46.805
I'm selfish and thoughtless

35:49.055 --> 35:51.055
and she doesn't want to marry me.

35:52.925 --> 35:55.215
That's crazy, okay? You're not sel...

35:56.965 --> 35:58.554
I mean, she should love you for you.

35:59.635 --> 36:02.765
Please... Please stop crying.

36:03.505 --> 36:04.845
Come here. Come on.

36:08.805 --> 36:14.134
Look, you can be a little
self-involved sometimes,

36:14.135 --> 36:16.634
but it's kind of endearing, you know,

36:16.635 --> 36:18.764
and for all your crazy,

36:18.765 --> 36:20.845
you make up for it with your laugh.

36:23.175 --> 36:24.925
I mean, it's the reason

36:25.635 --> 36:27.355
why I even fell in
love with you, you know?

36:28.965 --> 36:30.215
Thanks.

36:34.095 --> 36:35.595
I love you, Alice.

36:44.215 --> 36:45.215
Hey.

36:45.595 --> 36:47.215
Hey.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.095
How did you sleep?

36:49.925 --> 36:51.215
Good.

36:52.095 --> 36:53.845
I always sleep good in your arms.

36:56.175 --> 36:59.804
Tell me again what you said about Meera.

36:59.805 --> 37:02.504
You mean, like, what kind of terrorist

37:02.505 --> 37:04.924
wants a pie bar instead
of a wedding cake?

37:04.925 --> 37:07.214
Seriously.

37:12.885 --> 37:14.135
It's her.

37:15.215 --> 37:16.924
You don't have to answer.

37:16.925 --> 37:18.135
It's okay.

37:25.465 --> 37:26.765
Hello?

37:29.505 --> 37:31.135
Me too.

37:34.505 --> 37:36.265
I'm sorry too.

37:38.845 --> 37:42.175
Of course, I still wanna marry you.

37:44.265 --> 37:45.845
Ooh, I get my cake.

37:48.215 --> 37:51.005
Law school wasn't easy for me.

37:51.925 --> 37:54.265
I had to study a lot.

37:54.715 --> 37:55.965
I think...

37:57.215 --> 37:58.554
the only reason I got through

37:58.555 --> 38:00.965
was 'cause I was so focused

38:02.505 --> 38:04.385
and practically celibate.

38:05.095 --> 38:06.595
I'm just afraid that...

38:07.425 --> 38:10.264
I won't do what I need to do if...

38:10.265 --> 38:11.595
You're seeing me.

38:16.385 --> 38:17.385
Yeah.

38:22.175 --> 38:23.635
You got some work done.

38:26.465 --> 38:27.845
It's beautiful.

38:30.465 --> 38:32.005
Yeah, thanks.

38:35.385 --> 38:37.174
Maybe after I pass the bar

38:37.175 --> 38:39.095
and you get your show up...

38:48.765 --> 38:50.345
Yeah. Maybe.

39:06.265 --> 39:08.264
Three is the devil's number, okay?

39:08.265 --> 39:09.634
Someone always gets left out.

39:09.635 --> 39:11.595
- Trust me.
- Okay, no shame.

39:12.385 --> 39:13.385
Did you enjoy the sex?

39:14.215 --> 39:15.215
Yeah.

39:15.216 --> 39:19.005
And do you feel empowered as a woman

39:19.465 --> 39:21.135
in your sexuality?

39:22.465 --> 39:23.504
Yes, I do.

39:23.505 --> 39:25.344
Okay, then you had a successful night.

39:25.345 --> 39:27.964
You think a man feels weird
about having a three-way?

39:27.965 --> 39:30.215
- Absolutely not.
- True.

39:30.555 --> 39:32.264
Mm-hmm. What'd I miss?

39:32.265 --> 39:34.345
Everyone got laid except for us.

39:35.265 --> 39:37.135
Hmm. Speak for yourself.

39:37.465 --> 39:38.715
Kind of...

39:39.765 --> 39:40.925
Hey.

39:42.135 --> 39:43.135
Hi.

39:45.095 --> 39:46.425
One more time.

39:47.265 --> 39:48.464
I'm gonna call you about that date.

39:48.465 --> 39:49.585
What date? You lost the bet.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.175
That wasn't a bet, it was a gesture.

39:53.765 --> 39:55.095
Gesture?

39:57.345 --> 39:58.345
Ha!

39:58.965 --> 40:00.264
Damn, girl. Nice work.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.055
- Do what I can.
- He's good.

40:02.465 --> 40:04.594
Well, I'm very happy for all of you,

40:04.595 --> 40:07.425
but I'm gonna go into my
loft and kill myself now.

40:08.555 --> 40:10.054
I... I meant that ironically,

40:10.055 --> 40:12.094
- in case that's a trigger for anyone.
- Okay.

40:12.095 --> 40:13.095
Okay. Have fun.

40:15.925 --> 40:17.764
FYI, Paul was not terrible in bed.

40:17.765 --> 40:19.925
- You slept with Paul?
- No shame.

40:20.765 --> 40:22.384
We had revenge sex and it was awesome.

40:22.385 --> 40:24.055
And I'm officially done with Jeff.

40:25.505 --> 40:27.424
- Hallelujah.
- Mm-hmm.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.465
We nailed them.

40:30.595 --> 40:31.595
What are we listening to?

40:32.555 --> 40:34.884
Oh, um, Alice's date from last night,

40:34.885 --> 40:36.174
she has a radio show

40:36.175 --> 40:38.054
and she's afraid that Joey's
gonna talk crap about her.

40:38.055 --> 40:39.424
And now it's time

40:39.425 --> 40:41.214
to open the lines to requests.

40:41.215 --> 40:42.635
We have...

40:43.265 --> 40:45.715
I suck in DTLA.

40:46.505 --> 40:49.005
Uh, uh, hi. Uh, hi.

40:49.555 --> 40:50.635
Sorry.

40:51.345 --> 40:52.634
Crap.

40:52.635 --> 40:55.554
I'm wondering if you
have a song for a girl

40:55.555 --> 40:56.964
who really messed up on a first date

40:56.965 --> 40:59.464
and would do anything
for a second chance?

40:59.465 --> 41:00.505
Um...

41:02.215 --> 41:03.345
Yeah.

41:03.845 --> 41:05.384
I think I have something for that.

41:05.385 --> 41:08.264
Here's "Knicks" by The Quarterbacks.

41:08.265 --> 41:11.555
And here's hoping you
put an end to your drama

41:12.345 --> 41:14.304
and get that second date.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.134
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

41:16.135 --> 41:18.304
Go, Alice!

41:20.465 --> 41:22.214
Go, Alice!

41:22.215 --> 41:24.674
♪ Go, Alice, go, go, go ♪

41:24.675 --> 41:26.634
♪ Go, Alice, go, Alice ♪

41:26.635 --> 41:28.385
♪ Go, Alice, hey, hey ♪
