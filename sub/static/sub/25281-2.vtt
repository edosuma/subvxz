WEBVTT

01:21.373 --> 01:23.751
-Here.
-Oh, you, uh...?

01:23.793 --> 01:26.670
-Yeah. Keep the change.
-Sweet.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.932
-I already knocked.
-Cool.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.818
I know you weren't expecting me,

01:48.859 --> 01:52.363
but I have a few details
I want to add to the proposal.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.073
Of course. Come in.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.866
Thank you.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.244
You're fucking late.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.621
You have one job.

02:00.663 --> 02:02.706
There was an accident
on the 10.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.583
There's always
an accident on the 10.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.502
It was unforeseen
circumstances, man.

02:06.544 --> 02:09.797
Why are you still here?
Get the fuck out of here.

02:09.839 --> 02:12.091
Sorry about that, Tom,

02:12.132 --> 02:15.386
but the kid is
a fucking idiot!

02:25.813 --> 02:29.608
Sorry I'm late.
There was a accident on the 10.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.279
Let's go.
A little quicker.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.905
Can we, please?
Come on!

02:34.947 --> 02:37.658
I'd do it myself, but I don't
want to get my hands dirty.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.869
Salina, that's for you.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.453
Give me, give me two back.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.038
Thank you so much.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.957
Hey, why don't you guys

02:44.999 --> 02:47.209
get yourselves a Caesar salad
when you're in Tijuana.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.586
That's where it was invented!

02:59.763 --> 03:01.807
All right, love it.
How's the room?

03:01.849 --> 03:03.517
Cleaning crew's on standby.

03:03.559 --> 03:06.020
Ooh, you are crushing it today.
Thank you very much.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.855
You're welcome, Tom.
You're the best.

03:07.897 --> 03:10.107
Oh, come on.

03:10.149 --> 03:12.276
All right, gentlemen,
what is so important?

03:12.318 --> 03:13.819
What's happening?

03:13.861 --> 03:16.655
Uh, there are some people
within our organization

03:16.697 --> 03:19.575
-that we need to deal with,
'cause... -Neutralize.

03:19.617 --> 03:22.494
Yeah. I got a real pain
in the ass

03:22.536 --> 03:25.164
rich kid fuck boy
that's on the top of that list.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.708
Is that my blonde friend
from the hotel?

03:27.750 --> 03:29.293
Yeah, Mr. Punctual.

03:29.335 --> 03:31.670
He's not a gangbanger,
so he doesn't know the code.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.172
Probably start flapping his gums

03:33.213 --> 03:35.007
even before
the cops ask a question.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.717
All right, listen, look,
I don't do details, okay?

03:36.759 --> 03:38.510
If it makes Gabriel happy,
do it.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.512
Look, I'll-I'll have my guy
take care...

03:40.554 --> 03:42.097
I really--
I don't want to hear it.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.439
-Hey, man.
-Hey. What's up?

04:32.481 --> 04:34.692
How's your girl?

04:34.733 --> 04:38.278
Ah, still a bitch.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.662
Oh, man!

04:46.704 --> 04:48.414
Oh, he wiped out!

04:48.455 --> 04:50.791
Check this shit out.
Look, look, look, look.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.292
Oh!

04:52.334 --> 04:54.294
God! Oh.

04:55.921 --> 04:56.922
Oh, shit.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.429
Oh, fuck! Are you okay?

05:55.522 --> 05:58.317
I'm really sorry.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.323
He was a good man.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.325
And there's an asshole

06:06.366 --> 06:09.036
on every corner out there
still breathing.

06:19.171 --> 06:22.007
You know who did it?

06:22.049 --> 06:25.886
Well, the cops think
it was Marcos's crew.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.888
Yeah.

06:27.930 --> 06:31.433
Yeah, it's retaliation because
they think I killed Marcos.

06:31.475 --> 06:34.645
-My dad is dead because of me.
-No.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.898
-No, it's my fault
that my dad died. -No, it's not.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.234
It's not your fault.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.486
It's whoever killed Marcos's
fault, okay?

06:42.528 --> 06:44.947
Do you hear me?

06:46.949 --> 06:48.408
Yeah.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.583
So, what happens now?

06:56.625 --> 06:59.837
Well...

06:59.878 --> 07:03.549
I want to take your case
if you still want me to.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.551
Okay.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.302
So, yes?

07:07.344 --> 07:09.346
-Yes.
-Okay.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.431
Well, the next thing is, uh,

07:11.473 --> 07:14.518
we'll have
a preliminary hearing.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.520
And that'll determine
whether or not

07:16.562 --> 07:19.773
they think they have enough
evidence to take it to trial.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.192
If they don't, then it's done.

07:22.234 --> 07:25.154
-And I get out?
-Absolutely.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.952
But where do I go?

07:36.123 --> 07:38.500
I don't know, son.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.544
Okay.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.428
We were fitting him

07:49.469 --> 07:52.181
for a suit, and then,
the next thing you know...

07:52.222 --> 07:55.100
God, that's terrible. -Oh, it's awful.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.854
Did you see it happen?

07:58.896 --> 08:01.106
I heard it.
We heard the shots, but...

08:02.774 --> 08:04.443
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.445
How's Julio?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.989
Well, you can imagine.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.866
It's not good.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.868
I'm so sorry about Oscar.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.786
Yeah, he was
one of the good ones.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.289
You know, once, my, um,
my car wouldn't start,

08:17.331 --> 08:20.459
-and he waited with me
for Triple-A to show up. -Oh.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.294
Yeah.
-That's who he was.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.588
-Yeah.
-He helped me a lot.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.590
Anyway, I'm glad
to have you back.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.634
We can really use your help.

08:28.675 --> 08:32.054
Mm, glad to be back.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.313
Don't run now!
You'll hurt yourself.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.482
-Don't run.
-Is this the one you wanted?

08:43.523 --> 08:44.900
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.693
-So with nuts first, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

08:46.735 --> 08:49.321
Then, uh...

08:49.363 --> 08:50.906
-I think cinnamon.
-Cinnamon.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.324
-And then? -Sugar.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.951
-Sugar. Beautiful, yeah.
-Yeah.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.869
-And then just like this, yeah?
-Just roll it, baby.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.454
Roll it.
That's great. Oh, good.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.331
But it's coming out
on the sides a little bit.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.333
-Hello. Patty's phone.
-I don't know. That's a...

09:01.375 --> 09:03.835
-Yeah, a little bit. -All right,
I'll get it on the next one.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.545
Hey, everybody,
it's Billy McBride!

09:05.587 --> 09:07.047
-McBride! -Billy!
-Give me the phone.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.924
Billy!

09:08.966 --> 09:11.426
-Billy, why don't you come over,
huh? -No, don't come over.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.011
We're celebrating
Davit's birthday!

09:13.053 --> 09:15.639
-Billy, this is my birthday!
-Give me the phone!

09:15.681 --> 09:17.849
Tell him to come here!

09:17.891 --> 09:19.685
Hey, uh,
it's a little bit, um...

09:19.726 --> 09:22.479
-Shh!
-What?!

09:30.570 --> 09:32.656
And the anesthetic,
they're supposed to make it

09:32.698 --> 09:34.491
where you don't feel.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.493
Believe me, I felt it.

09:36.535 --> 09:39.830
Then he goes to remove
the bunion, and he says to me,

09:39.871 --> 09:42.332
"Would you like to keep it
as a souvenir?"

09:42.374 --> 09:44.376
This is a joke.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.044
This is no joke to me.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.338
Only God and I know
the pain I've been suffering.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.340
-Yeah. -Show him. Show him.
-Don't show him.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.800
No, ma'am,
you don't have to do that.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.176
-I believe you.
-Don't show him.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.429
Oh, that's okay.
You don't have to.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.930
-Five days.
-I-I believe you.

09:56.972 --> 10:00.225
It's been five days.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.812
Just killing me.
Can't you see it on my face?

10:03.854 --> 10:06.231
-Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. I saw
it already. -Did you see it?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.734
Do we have a case, Billy

10:08.775 --> 10:11.194
Well, I don't-- I haven't really
handled a bunion case before,

10:11.236 --> 10:13.113
-so I'm not sure.
-Well, it's been five days,

10:13.155 --> 10:14.614
He can't help her.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.908
He can't help her.
Sit down. Sit down.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.660
Ah, listen.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.621
I have a good real estate
business we can run together.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.540
No! -

10:23.582 --> 10:26.585
That's the real estate girl,
real estate person.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.420
Not really me.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.675
Oh. -BILLY: Here you go.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.594
Jesus Christ.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.804
-Um, all right.
-Here, I got you.

10:37.846 --> 10:41.016
Thank you.
I better, um...

10:41.058 --> 10:44.853
Thank you. I better
get back in there, so...

10:44.895 --> 10:46.772
What's up?

10:46.813 --> 10:49.149
Well, I-I want to get this
out right away.

10:49.191 --> 10:52.361
Uh, just want you to know
I hired Brittany back,

10:52.402 --> 10:55.197
just to do some paperwork
and stuff.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.202
I mean, I think
it's deeply stupid, but...

11:00.243 --> 11:02.204
I mean, I don't care.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.915
It's got nothing to do with me.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.042
Yeah, well...

11:07.084 --> 11:09.169
To me, I think that
about the only thing

11:09.211 --> 11:10.962
that's not forgivable
is murder.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.298
Anything else I'd say
you can forgive people for.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.802
I don't care. I mean, I...
It's-it's your business.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.804
Oh, I got my reasons.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.145
-Oh.

11:29.231 --> 11:32.651
You remember Oscar, right

11:32.692 --> 11:34.820
Oh, yeah.
Nice guy with the hair nets.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.697
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.450
Well, his sons-- they're, uh,
they're gangbangers,

11:40.492 --> 11:42.619
and they've been gangbangers
for a while,

11:42.661 --> 11:45.038
and they got in the middle
of some bad shit

11:45.080 --> 11:47.999
-and got themselves killed.
-Oh.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.418
His little kid,
the fresh-faced one

11:49.459 --> 11:51.420
used to come in the bar
all the time, you know?

11:51.461 --> 11:53.380
-I remember, yeah.
-Little kid. Yeah.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.674
He gets arrested
for taking care of the guys

11:55.715 --> 11:57.175
that got his brothers.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.678
Some kind of retaliation
supposedly.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.054
Not such a great kid then, huh?

12:01.096 --> 12:02.472
Well, no,
I think he is, actually.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.891
At least I think
it's worth looking into.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.187
Anyhow...

12:09.229 --> 12:11.064
Oscar is the kid's only alibi.

12:11.106 --> 12:14.484
He was home at the time, and...

12:14.526 --> 12:19.322
Oscar was gonna go to court,
you know, testify for the kid.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.324
And, uh...

12:21.366 --> 12:25.370
anyway, he left, and, uh,
was headed back to Chez Jay,

12:25.412 --> 12:29.207
and I heard some gunshots,
and, uh, ran outside,

12:29.249 --> 12:34.171
and, uh... Oscar was laying
in the parking lot.

12:36.214 --> 12:39.759
So now the kid's got nobody.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.887
His dad's dead,
his brothers are dead,

12:41.928 --> 12:45.098
and he's in jail for murder.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.726
It looks like he's going down.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.187
So I took the case.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.566
And I need your help.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.449
Just... look, y-you don't
have to deal with Brittany.

13:02.491 --> 13:04.075
Like I said, she'll stay

13:04.117 --> 13:05.952
-a hundred yards away from you
all the time. -No.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.330
She's just doing paperwork
for me.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.166
Okay, Brittany aside,
my life, it's-it's...

13:11.208 --> 13:13.168
-it's full right now.
-Yeah.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.129
Okay? If you knew the shit that
I have to deal with right now...

13:16.171 --> 13:17.881
Look, could you just
hear me out, please?

13:17.923 --> 13:20.342
But even-- wait-- even if I was
just sitting on my ass all day,

13:20.383 --> 13:22.928
right, I cannot,
under any circumstances,

13:22.969 --> 13:24.971
do another case right now.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.348
I can't.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.141
I mean, the last one
nearly killed us.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.769
You know that.
And a murder case?

13:30.810 --> 13:33.980
Really

13:36.316 --> 13:39.277
Yeah, I know.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.821
Believe me,
I thought about that.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.785
Look, I was holding
the guy's hand when he died.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.371
Okay? That does
something to you.

13:49.412 --> 13:52.207
And if I've got any passion
for doing this shit

13:52.249 --> 13:55.835
left in me at all,
this is where I need to use it.

13:57.587 --> 14:00.590
I get it. And I'm-I'm...

14:00.632 --> 14:04.052
I really am sorry,
but I can't do it.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.679
Yep.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.644
Could you do me another favor
on a different subject?

14:12.686 --> 14:14.729
Yeah.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.108
Could you call me sometimes?

14:18.149 --> 14:20.318
I haven't heard from you,
you know.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.614
I mean, come see me sometime
even, have a drink with me.

14:24.656 --> 14:28.493
Yes, I will come and see you,
and we will have a cola.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.787
-Okay?
-Okay.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.331
Okay.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.793
-It was very nice seeing you.
-It was good to see you.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.434
All right, well,
let me ask you this.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.186
Who set
you up with your third wife?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.397
This guy, right?
Because we're friends.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.482
And that's why
I'm gonna give you a break

14:59.524 --> 15:01.067
on the first six months...

15:01.109 --> 15:02.819
-Cigarette?
-Yeah, let me get a cigarette.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.655
On the first six months
if you sign for three years.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.327
What's the problem?
They each have their own tent.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.247
It's rustic, Carl!

15:16.166 --> 15:17.876
All right, listen.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.754
You change your mind, all right,
you give me a call today.

15:20.795 --> 15:23.673
If not, I-I got a lot of people
looking at this space.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.342
All right?

15:25.383 --> 15:27.844
Bye.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.597
You know why you're having
trouble renting this place?

15:30.639 --> 15:33.391
-Why's that? -'Cause you
don't have free Wi-Fi.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.393
You're absolutely right.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.104
I usually am.

15:38.146 --> 15:41.441
You know, I was talking to my
psychic friend about you today.

15:41.483 --> 15:42.817
Great.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.028
She says you're unhappy.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.572
She says she sees more for you.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.783
So do I.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.911
You have a chartreuse aura
about you today.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.746
-Chartreuse.
-Yeah.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.665
Green and yellow.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.668
It's like, money and happiness
is coming your way.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.169
All right.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.630
Maybe even some dick.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.133
Maybe, Tish. Maybe.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.886
Want a snack

16:11.805 --> 16:13.598
-Oh, that's nice.
-Crackers.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.108
Eh, I kinda bunched 'em up.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.068
Sorry, girls.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.153
-Okay, Midge. You got it, baby.
-What's up?

16:27.195 --> 16:29.155
Don't think it was racked tight
enough. That's what I think.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.079
All right. No, scratch.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.747
All right, Trudy.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.958
Show 'em who we are.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.167
Okay.

16:41.209 --> 16:42.752
There you go.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.004
All right.
Let me give you a mean eye.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.881
That's more your speed, I think.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.220
Ooh, I'm shaking
something good right now.

16:52.262 --> 16:55.098
Show me how it's done, boss.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.229
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.315
You told me
to come see you sometime,

17:04.357 --> 17:07.360
so I'm seeing you sometime.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.987
Trudy, you're on your own, baby.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.947
-I got to take this.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.450
All right. Champion.

17:13.491 --> 17:16.244
Have a seat.

17:17.579 --> 17:20.415
What's up?

17:20.457 --> 17:23.168
Um...

17:23.209 --> 17:26.254
I need you to keep her ass
away from me.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.506
-Trudy?
-No. Trudy.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.258
Brittany.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.470
Um, I want to have no contact
with her whatsoever, okay?

17:33.511 --> 17:35.221
At all.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.390
I'm gonna help you,

17:37.432 --> 17:40.143
but if it turns into
a fucking nightmare, I'm out.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.061
That's the deal. Okay?

17:42.103 --> 17:45.023
-Deal?
-Absolutely.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.484
-Okay.
-Cool.

17:57.494 --> 18:00.497
It's pro bono.
I forgot to tell you that part.

18:13.009 --> 18:16.054
I hate you.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.264
I hate you very much.

18:18.306 --> 18:21.309
I hate you, too, honey.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.329
Ew.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.717
Hey.

18:54.759 --> 18:57.262
What are you, Tammy Wynette?

18:57.303 --> 18:58.805
What's going on?

18:58.847 --> 19:02.141
I don't know what that is.
Um...

19:02.183 --> 19:05.645
look, so, I know that you can
just go buy more,

19:05.687 --> 19:09.274
or have a drink at the bar
that you practically live at,

19:09.315 --> 19:11.985
but...

19:12.026 --> 19:15.113
I'm really hoping...

19:15.154 --> 19:19.200
that this will cause you
to stop and think

19:19.242 --> 19:21.828
next time you're gonna drink.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.845
I'm doing this
'cause I care about you.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.818
Huskies are
notorious escape artists.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.279
-Mm. -You know, if you were
gonna have a husky,

19:56.321 --> 19:58.990
-you've got to have a fence
that's high -

19:59.032 --> 20:01.492
-and a lock on it, 'cause...
-Hello?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.828
-Oh, hi. Oh, my.
-Hi.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.997
-How's it going? Um...

20:06.039 --> 20:07.999
-Come on.
-You want, you want to do that?

20:08.041 --> 20:11.044
-Yeah. All right.
-Okay. Yep.

20:11.085 --> 20:14.380
Um, so, can I get a copy
of the witness statement

20:14.422 --> 20:16.382
and the police report,
if you have it?

20:16.424 --> 20:19.260
Yeah, you sure can.
Let's see here.

20:25.934 --> 20:29.312
Hmm. Where is it You been good?

20:29.354 --> 20:30.563
-Who, me?
-Uh-huh.

20:30.605 --> 20:31.814
I have been great.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.442
-Been working for Postmates.
-Oh.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.153
I, uh... I'm getting
my degree in criminal justice,

20:37.195 --> 20:39.030
so I've been studying for that.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.449
-Nice.
-And, uh, hanging out here,

20:41.491 --> 20:43.618
getting reacquainted
with Brittany.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.787
-Okay. Nice. All right.
-There you go.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.373
-Thanks, Patty. -Yep, thank you.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.627
That went better than
I thought that it would.

20:52.669 --> 20:56.589
Whatever. I don't give a shit.

21:05.306 --> 21:08.142
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.561
-Hi. -I'm sorry I'm late.
The parking guy was a whore.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.188
Do I have time for a smoke?

21:12.230 --> 21:14.774
-Sure. Why not?
-God.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.153
What's wrong with you?

21:19.195 --> 21:20.822
Nothing.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.074
Just getting geared up,
that's all.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.326
Morning, Billy.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.328
So you decided to take the case.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.622
Yeah.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.833
Hope you're ready.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.543
Who was that?

21:33.584 --> 21:36.170
That's the prosecution.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.924
He's, like,
super attractive, right?

21:39.966 --> 21:41.759
I've been up against him before.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.971
-We should go.
-And?

21:45.013 --> 21:47.181
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.600
-Tell me now.
-We got a hearing, honey.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.353
-I don't want to tell you now.
-Talk fast. Tell me now.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.147
Julio was at home that evening

21:54.188 --> 21:56.691
practicing his cello
in his room.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.318
His father, Oscar,
was downstairs, and...

21:59.360 --> 22:01.320
Your Honor,
this is, this is hearsay

22:01.362 --> 22:02.822
from a non-percipient witness.

22:02.864 --> 22:04.866
This is reliable hearsay,
Your Honor.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.744
-I'm a notary public.
-Look, I'm sure Mrs. Jefferson

22:07.785 --> 22:10.413
is a, is a wonderful notary
public, but the question here

22:10.455 --> 22:12.749
is whether what Mr. Suarez
told her is reliable.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.543
This is not a trial.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.712
There's no jury.

22:17.754 --> 22:21.382
The court can hear
inherently reliable evidence.

22:21.424 --> 22:24.177
Mr. McBride,
the state has a point.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.012
They cannot
cross-examine Mr. Suarez.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.306
What makes this testimony
trustworthy?

22:28.347 --> 22:30.892
Your Honor, Julio Suarez
is a really good kid.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.102
His academics are pristine.

22:33.144 --> 22:35.021
He's lost his father,
he's lost his brothers.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.440
An alibi,

22:37.482 --> 22:40.151
Your Honor, by a man
who's willing to say anything

22:40.193 --> 22:41.694
to save his son's life
is not trustworthy.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.696
The burden of proof
is on the state.

22:43.738 --> 22:46.449
-What did they put up today?
-We have motive.

22:46.491 --> 22:49.327
Okay? His brothers were
supposedly killed by the victim.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.037
We have an eyewitness
that places the defendant

22:51.079 --> 22:52.705
-at the scene. -This is
all speculation. Marcos Peña

22:52.747 --> 22:55.124
was a known gang member.
He's got a lot of enemies.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.876
And in terms of
this so-called eyewitness,

22:56.918 --> 22:59.754
he was across the street,
under the overpass,

22:59.796 --> 23:01.339
walking his dog.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.341
His view was obstructed.
It was late at night.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.301
There were barely
any streetlights.

23:05.343 --> 23:06.969
Finally, they got
no murder weapon

23:07.011 --> 23:08.805
or any physical evidence
whatsoever

23:08.846 --> 23:10.973
to tie Julio to the crime scene.

23:11.015 --> 23:12.725
This is inadmissible hearsay.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.560
The witness is excluded.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.979
-You can step down.
-Okay.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.690
Mr. Rashad,
do you have anything else?

23:19.732 --> 23:21.526
Yes, yes.
Um, we actually do.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.112
We just received some footage
from a security camera from

23:24.153 --> 23:26.197
one of the... the neighbor's
house down the street.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.449
-Do you mind if we play it?
-Mm. Go ahead.

23:32.411 --> 23:36.958
23 p.m.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.335
That was just moments
after the murders occurred.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.591
And that...

23:45.633 --> 23:47.343
is Julio Suarez.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.720
That is Julio Suarez,

23:49.762 --> 23:53.891
who is clearly not at home with
his father, playing the cello.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.353
It seems that
there is a handgun,

23:57.395 --> 24:00.022
not a cello,
in Julio's waistband,

24:00.064 --> 24:02.441
as he runs from
the scene of the murders.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.617
That went pretty well, yeah?

24:11.659 --> 24:13.703
I happen to know that,
without a murder weapon,

24:13.744 --> 24:15.872
you can never count
Billy McBride out.

24:15.913 --> 24:17.665
So find it.

24:20.877 --> 24:23.838
Get back to your office.
I need you to contact...

24:28.467 --> 24:30.803
I didn't do it. I swear.

24:30.845 --> 24:33.514
Well, we just saw videotape
of you running away with a gun.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.850
But I didn't kill anybody.

24:35.892 --> 24:39.604
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life in prison?

24:39.645 --> 24:43.149
If you lie to me, that's
what's gonna happen to you.

24:43.191 --> 24:45.193
You're gonna spend the rest
of your fucking life in jail.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.028
-Think about that.
-We're not gonna get anywhere

24:47.069 --> 24:49.530
until you tell us the truth.
Do you understand that?

24:51.032 --> 24:53.492
What's the story with the tape?

24:55.494 --> 24:57.622
I was at Marcos's place.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.082
Right. Why were you there?

25:00.124 --> 25:03.294
I was...

25:03.336 --> 25:06.797
I was gonna kill Marcos, but...

25:06.839 --> 25:08.883
I heard some gunshots,
then I ran away.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.927
Where's the gun?

25:13.638 --> 25:15.598
I threw it in the ocean.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.059
I ran home, and then
I went into my room,

25:18.100 --> 25:19.936
-but I couldn't do it.
-Julio.

25:21.604 --> 25:24.523
Don't ever lie to me again.
Do you understand that?

25:24.565 --> 25:26.234
Yes, sir.

25:26.275 --> 25:29.111
Now, what about the gunshots?

25:29.153 --> 25:31.781
You get a look at the guy?

25:31.822 --> 25:33.574
I didn't see his face.

25:33.616 --> 25:36.619
Well, was he Hispanic or white
or black or what?

25:36.661 --> 25:38.829
-He-he was Hispanic.
-Good.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.832
He-he was short and...

25:41.874 --> 25:44.460
-I mean, he was really short.
-What else?

25:45.962 --> 25:48.256
-That's it.
-That's it?

25:48.297 --> 25:49.548
Yeah.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.597
I know how bad this looks.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.933
Goddamn right, it does.

26:12.655 --> 26:14.782
What the fuck is this?

26:14.824 --> 26:17.535
This is for one guy.
I don't do two-for-one specials.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.620
Keep your voice down.

26:19.662 --> 26:23.040
Yeah. Well, nobody
told you to, okay?

26:23.082 --> 26:27.086
This was one and done.
Just blondie.

26:27.128 --> 26:29.922
You want problems?
That's fine.

26:29.964 --> 26:31.882
I can make problems.

26:31.924 --> 26:35.469
Trust me,
nobody here wants problems.

26:35.511 --> 26:36.929
Then you're half short.

26:36.971 --> 26:39.557
-Who's short?
-Try me, pendejo.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.563
Okay. I'll get you
the rest of the money

26:45.604 --> 26:47.565
when you give me the gun.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.941
I fucking tossed it, ese.

26:48.983 --> 26:50.526
You told me to get rid of it.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.321
Right. And now
I'm telling you I need it.

26:53.362 --> 26:56.407
Well, I threw it
in some Dumpster.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.367
Which fucking Dumpster?

26:58.409 --> 27:00.870
I don't fucking know.

27:37.531 --> 27:39.283
Stay here.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.952
You got it.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.253
What's up, JT

27:54.882 --> 27:58.302
My magnetic personality
is irresistible.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.346
You want to try it?
Come on out.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.681
-You know how I feel
about water. -

28:02.723 --> 28:05.684
I know how you feel about water.
I'll be in.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.645
All right.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.648
Come on inside, Billy.
Come on inside.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.024
It stinks.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.694
You want something to drink?

28:15.736 --> 28:19.323
I'll get it, unless you
stripped my cupboard bare.

28:19.365 --> 28:22.076
There she is.

28:22.118 --> 28:25.037
-Yeah.
-See you got a new radio.

28:25.079 --> 28:27.373
Santa Barbara Police Department.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.166
They were just gonna
throw it away.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.918
Perfectly good condition,

28:30.960 --> 28:33.129
and they were gonna toss it
in the trash. It makes no sense.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.506
You know Santa Barbara;
they like new shit up there.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.508
-Yeah, they do. Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.135
How's the Suarez case going?

28:39.176 --> 28:40.803
-I've been watching that one.
-Yeah?

28:40.845 --> 28:43.305
Well, actually,
that's why I'm here.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.307
-Okay.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.685
My client saw the shooter
run away from the scene.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.687
Didn't get a good look at him.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.773
All we know is he's a brown guy,
short brown guy.

28:52.815 --> 28:55.693
Evidently, really short
brown guy.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.903
-You're looking for
a short brown guy. -Yeah.

28:57.945 --> 29:01.198
-So you come to a-an expert.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.534
You want a chaparro,
a cabrón negrito.

29:03.576 --> 29:06.370
You know, I know 200 guys
that fit that description.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.039
-I know.
-It's not a, not a lot to go on.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.749
I'm sorry, bud,
that's all I got.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.793
Well, I will work my people.

29:12.835 --> 29:14.795
-They are there for me.
-Cool.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.089
-See what I can do. Yeah.
-Okay.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.260
-Hey, Billy.
-Yeah.

29:21.302 --> 29:23.053
Don't go in the ocean.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.097
Lot of chatter
on the Coast Guard radio

29:25.139 --> 29:26.807
about chum in the water.

29:26.849 --> 29:28.809
-You know what I mean?
-No.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.645
Evidently, the, uh, drug cartel
dumped a bunch of bodies

29:31.687 --> 29:34.648
and body parts in the--
a little close to the shore,

29:34.690 --> 29:37.651
so, uh, watch out
for sharks, Billy.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.737
Appreciate the advice.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.572
All right, man.
Love you, buddy.

29:41.614 --> 29:43.616
-I love you.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.420
Okay, here she comes.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.798
-Miss Silva. Miss Silva.
-There she is.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.633
Miss Silva. Excuse me.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.219
Councilwoman. Did you visit
Julio Suarez in jail?

30:45.261 --> 30:47.054
What is your relationship
with Julio Suarez?

30:47.096 --> 30:49.223
-And how long have you known
him

30:49.265 --> 30:51.016
In fact, do you think
he's a killer?

30:51.058 --> 30:53.394
The only reason this case
has gotten so much attention

30:53.435 --> 30:55.896
is because a white kid
from Brentwood was killed.

30:55.938 --> 30:57.898
And it's easy to blame
the brown kid

30:57.940 --> 31:01.360
and chalk it up into
gang violence, but...

31:01.402 --> 31:04.363
That's why the community center
is so important,

31:04.405 --> 31:07.700
for these kids to know they have
people who believe in them,

31:07.741 --> 31:10.494
just like I believe
in Julio Suarez.

31:14.582 --> 31:17.626
-Wait!
-No more questions.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.025
Hola.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.318
-Hola, Billy.
-What's up, honey?

31:42.359 --> 31:43.986
How you doing?

31:44.028 --> 31:45.988
Sorry. Uh, that's my upbringing.

31:46.030 --> 31:48.699
-We call everybody "honey."

31:48.741 --> 31:50.784
-I think it's cute.
-Yeah.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.871
Uh, not much. I've just been
here waiting for you

31:53.912 --> 31:57.291
for, like, two hours, I think.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.835
-Well, do you want to come up?
Come on. -Yeah. I...

31:59.877 --> 32:01.879
You know, the-the kids
at the community center

32:01.920 --> 32:05.299
-signed this card for Julio.
-Yeah.

32:05.341 --> 32:07.468
-Come on, let's go, let's go.
-Yeah, and, uh,

32:07.509 --> 32:10.220
I was thinking that you

32:10.262 --> 32:13.932
could deliver this to him,
now that you're his lawyer.

32:15.893 --> 32:17.895
-You heard about that, huh?
-Yes, and I'm so happy.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.229
Stop it.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.482
I feel much better
about everything.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.942
-Yeah?
-Yes.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.821
Good.

32:27.863 --> 32:30.157
-So, uh, would you give it
to him? -Of course.

32:30.199 --> 32:32.701
-Yeah, yeah. It's no sweat.
-I-I would, but...

32:32.743 --> 32:34.370
No, I get it.

32:34.411 --> 32:36.538
Next time I see him,
I'll give it to him.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.582
Thank you.

32:42.670 --> 32:46.590
Sorry, I-I haven't called you
about the drink, I know.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.634
No, you never have.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.931
I got some glasses in there.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.851
I mean, can't promise you
how clean they are.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.104
I don't care. I can...

33:00.145 --> 33:03.190
drink out of a bottle
behind closed doors.

33:05.234 --> 33:07.861
I'm fucked, aren't I?

33:09.905 --> 33:13.367
We are both fucked.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.411
Come on, let's go.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.792
Okay.

34:40.704 --> 34:44.041
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

35:39.555 --> 35:42.474
-Let's go.
-Geez, what do you want?

35:42.516 --> 35:45.394
-Come on, let's go.
-Hey. Ow.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.104
You want to tell me
what's going on?

35:47.145 --> 35:49.690
Quiet.

35:49.731 --> 35:51.775
I'm going. Jesus.

36:13.964 --> 36:15.924
This is Wyatt.

36:15.966 --> 36:18.343
Did you
have a good workout, Tom?

36:18.385 --> 36:21.597
Jesus, Gabriel.
You scared the shit out of me.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.307
How are you, my friend?

36:23.348 --> 36:25.559
Me, uh, I'm not
a gym person, you know?

36:25.601 --> 36:28.145
I like to be outside
in the fresh air.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.813
Listen, if this is about, uh...

36:29.855 --> 36:31.565
Let me finish, Tom.

36:31.607 --> 36:34.484
You know I don't like
to be interrupted.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.194
I'm sorry. Of course.

36:36.236 --> 36:37.988
I need you to focus, Tom.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.532
You said everything was
under control, and it's not.

36:40.574 --> 36:42.451
The DEA is getting too close.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.453
And I hear this
high-profile lawyer

36:44.494 --> 36:46.163
Billy McBride's on the case.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.081
Now, this is the kind of
attention I don't want.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.667
-Do you understand?
-Hey, I a hundred percent agree.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.295
-And I-I promise you, this is...
-Oh, enough with the promises.

36:53.337 --> 36:56.673
Get Marisol Silva under control.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.884
I will, but if you could...

36:58.926 --> 37:02.679
Tom, interrupt me again.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.681
Get Marisol Silva
to shut her mouth.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.600
We need the kid to be convicted

37:06.642 --> 37:09.645
so this investigation is over,
you understand?

37:13.857 --> 37:15.817
You give me two days,

37:15.859 --> 37:17.903
you won't even know
this ever happened.

37:17.945 --> 37:19.780
I'm telling you,
you give Tom Wyatt two--

37:19.821 --> 37:22.199
Gabriel? Hello.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.411
Fuck.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.222
Fucking disgusting. Fuck!

37:45.263 --> 37:47.349
Shit.

37:47.391 --> 37:49.851
Shut the fuck up.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.728
Find the fucking thing,
goddamn it.

37:51.770 --> 37:55.232
I can't see shit! Fuck.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.234
How do you know this is
the right fucking Dumpster?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.444
-I don't know. -Do you have
any fucking idea where we are?

37:59.486 --> 38:00.946
-I don't...
-You don't know, do you?

38:00.988 --> 38:02.864
-You don't fucking have any
idea! -I thought it was here!

38:02.906 --> 38:05.200
-Where the fuck is it?
-Shh.

38:05.242 --> 38:06.827
-Where...?
-I put it right here.

38:06.868 --> 38:09.121
-God fucking...
-Don't fucking know where it is.

38:09.162 --> 38:11.248
-Fuck!
-What?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.166
-Where the fuck it go?
-I don't know!

38:13.208 --> 38:15.043
-Where is it? -I don't know
where the fuck it is!

38:15.085 --> 38:16.962
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

38:19.006 --> 38:20.966
Danny. Danny.

38:21.008 --> 38:23.385
Danny. Hey, Danny.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.141
Oh, shit.

38:29.182 --> 38:30.684
W-What the fuck happened, man?

38:30.726 --> 38:32.811
Some creepy fuck
with a fucking hook hand

38:32.853 --> 38:35.188
-just kidnapped me. Fuck!
-Who

38:35.230 --> 38:37.441
I-I don't know. It was one
of Gabriel's fucking guys,

38:37.482 --> 38:39.151
and he said he's gonna kill me.

38:39.192 --> 38:40.944
-Fucking dead!
-Okay, okay. Calm-calm down.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.863
What did he say -Fuck. Fuck.

38:42.904 --> 38:44.865
"What did he say?"
Jesus Christ, Danny.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.491
I don't give a fuck
what he said.

38:46.533 --> 38:49.119
Fucking Marisol. Fuck, man!

38:49.161 --> 38:50.912
-I told her. I told her.
-Okay. Okay.

38:50.954 --> 38:52.831
She didn't fucking lay in you,
motherfucker.

38:52.873 --> 38:55.500
-I gave you one fucking job!
-Stop fucking hitting me, man!

38:55.542 --> 38:56.835
You said you were
gonna handle this, huh?

38:56.877 --> 38:58.253
-You like this fucking car?!
-Stop fucking...

38:58.295 --> 38:59.713
-Stop fucking hitting me, man!
-You like all this shit

38:59.755 --> 39:01.006
I've given you, motherfucker?

39:01.048 --> 39:03.341
-Fucking made you!
-I'm trying to fucking drive!

39:03.383 --> 39:05.052
-I gave you everything, fucker!

39:06.803 --> 39:09.139
-Fuck you! Fuck you, man!

39:09.181 --> 39:11.141
Nobody tells me what to do!

39:11.183 --> 39:13.977
Get the fuck off me!

39:14.019 --> 39:17.814
Get me to a shower, you fuck!

39:23.653 --> 39:26.490
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.450
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

40:15.914 --> 40:18.500
Hang on a sec.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.544
I tried the bar first.

40:24.965 --> 40:28.301
Look, McBride,
I'm here out of respect.

40:28.343 --> 40:32.389
I'd like to put a plea offer
on the table.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.350
The kid was at the crime scene,
but he didn't kill anybody.

40:35.392 --> 40:37.352
-He told you that?
-Yeah, and I believe him.

40:37.394 --> 40:39.604
Yeah, I know you do,
because you want to believe it.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.231
I hope you don't have
some big speech planned.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.858
We don't have an audience here.

40:42.899 --> 40:45.485
I'm offering
voluntary manslaughter.

40:45.527 --> 40:49.030
11 years. Uh, good behavior,
he'll be out in maybe seven.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.032
By that time,
he's only 23 years old.

40:51.074 --> 40:52.659
-That's enough...
-You know what happens to a kid

40:52.701 --> 40:54.119
when they put him in jail
for seven years.

40:54.161 --> 40:55.620
It's a fair offer.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.497
You're gonna do him
more harm than good

40:57.539 --> 40:59.416
if you don't take it.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.419
He didn't do it.

41:04.421 --> 41:07.465
The offer is on the table.

41:07.507 --> 41:11.344
You have an obligation to take
that offer to your client.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.180
I don't want this case
being overturned

41:13.221 --> 41:15.515
for ineffective assistance
of counsel.

41:17.559 --> 41:19.936
No chance.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.980
Good.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.360
$50 million?

41:27.402 --> 41:29.070
Okay.

41:29.112 --> 41:31.156
You know,
I don't get to keep it all.

41:31.198 --> 41:32.908
You know how that works.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.951
Yeah, I can tell.

41:53.720 --> 41:57.849
That's for you.
A gift from Miss Silva.

43:27.689 --> 43:30.066
Oh, I remember
you had the salmon ravioli,

43:30.108 --> 43:32.068
and I had the lamb chop,
and I very clearly remember

43:32.110 --> 43:33.903
telling you to distance yourself

43:33.945 --> 43:35.989
-from Julio Suarez.
-He is innocent.

43:36.031 --> 43:38.658
Kids like Julio are
the cornerstone of my campaign.

43:38.700 --> 43:41.202
Okay, this-this is not
about the fucking election!

43:41.244 --> 43:43.330
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny.

43:43.371 --> 43:46.416
Th-Then just tell me
what's going on.

43:46.458 --> 43:49.627
The floor is yours.

43:49.669 --> 43:52.297
When you tipped us off
about the DEA raids,

43:52.339 --> 43:54.257
we had to do some housecleaning.

43:54.299 --> 43:57.635
That's your fucking business.
I did you a favor.

43:57.677 --> 43:59.721
I probably shouldn't have.

43:59.763 --> 44:03.058
But I'm not involved
in whatever mess this is.

44:03.099 --> 44:05.518
Okay, here's-here's how
you're involved.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.228
Hunter what's-his-name,
the white kid?

44:07.270 --> 44:08.813
He was one of ours.

44:08.855 --> 44:11.232
Okay? This is where
it gets real fucking real.

44:11.274 --> 44:13.943
We needed to get rid of him.

44:15.779 --> 44:18.698
Y-You had him killed?

44:22.035 --> 44:24.871
All I did was pass along a tip
so you can clean up

44:24.913 --> 44:26.164
whatever mess
you needed to clean up,

44:26.206 --> 44:27.791
not fucking kill people.

44:27.832 --> 44:30.210
Well, regardless, Julio Suarez
getting picked up for it

44:30.251 --> 44:32.003
is good for us.

44:32.045 --> 44:34.506
There it is,
crystal fucking clear.

44:37.550 --> 44:39.552
No, I...

44:42.222 --> 44:44.182
I never meant...

44:44.224 --> 44:47.185
Well, intention or not,
it's what happened,

44:47.227 --> 44:49.396
and we need
to fucking deal with it.

44:49.437 --> 44:52.357
I mean, Jesus, you're the one
that introduced Tom to La Mano.

44:52.399 --> 44:56.319
Through a friend of a friend.
I-I don't know the guy at all.

44:56.361 --> 44:58.738
And I never would've been
involved in anything like this.

44:58.780 --> 45:01.324
Can I say something, please?

45:01.366 --> 45:03.993
Okay? Excuse me.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.620
This is just bad luck.

45:05.662 --> 45:07.163
Okay? This is a kid you know

45:07.205 --> 45:09.165
who was in the wrong situation
at the wrong...

45:09.207 --> 45:10.542
-He's not just a kid, Tom.
-No, no, no, we get it.

45:10.583 --> 45:11.876
-We get it.
-He won't stop. He's perfect.

45:11.918 --> 45:13.294
He's a good kid. He's innocent.

45:13.336 --> 45:15.130
We've seen you
on the fucking news

45:15.171 --> 45:17.132
night after night,
saying just that!

45:17.173 --> 45:19.384
And we're not
the only ones watching.

45:19.426 --> 45:21.761
What does he mean?

45:29.644 --> 45:32.021
Mm-hmm.

45:35.108 --> 45:37.694
All I did...

45:37.735 --> 45:40.029
was arrange for you to meet.

45:40.071 --> 45:42.407
Okay?

45:42.449 --> 45:45.618
All I did was arrange
for you to meet.

45:45.660 --> 45:48.496
I did. I did.

45:48.538 --> 45:51.458
Um, I had a-a gun in my back

45:51.499 --> 45:53.877
with my balls hanging out
in a towel

45:53.918 --> 45:56.421
in the back
of a black fucking Escalade.

45:56.463 --> 45:59.007
-And the... I think the henchman

45:59.048 --> 46:00.842
had a hook hand, and he told me

46:00.884 --> 46:05.472
he was gonna cut
my fucking dick off!

46:07.515 --> 46:10.685
Yeah.

46:10.727 --> 46:12.395
-Yeah, I'd say Julio's your...
-Come on, don't be, don't be...

46:12.437 --> 46:14.022
-No, I-I would.
-Don't...

46:14.063 --> 46:15.899
-Yeah.
-Let's be helpful.

46:15.940 --> 46:18.359
Let's be helpful. Okay?
We're here to help you.

46:18.401 --> 46:21.571
We're here to help us.
We're a team. Right?

46:21.613 --> 46:23.781
I'm sorry.

46:23.823 --> 46:25.366
This is not your fault.

46:25.408 --> 46:27.327
Danny's sorry. Okay?

46:27.368 --> 46:30.580
He knows this is
a shitty situation.

46:30.622 --> 46:32.999
But th-there's
a bottom line here.

46:33.041 --> 46:35.710
If Julio goes to jail,

46:35.752 --> 46:38.171
we are in the clear.

46:38.213 --> 46:41.007
Julio goes free,

46:41.049 --> 46:44.052
we all go down.

46:44.093 --> 46:47.138
I know you.

46:47.180 --> 46:51.184
And you are stronger
than you think you are.

46:53.895 --> 46:56.022
-You got this.

47:05.615 --> 47:08.034
-Good night, Miss Elena.
-Good night.

47:08.076 --> 47:11.246
-What happened to your face?
-Uh, basketball.

47:11.287 --> 47:13.289
No.

47:17.627 --> 47:19.837
Is everything okay?

47:19.879 --> 47:22.173
Yes, all is good.

47:22.215 --> 47:25.176
Great. Uh, one quick thing.

47:25.218 --> 47:27.428
Uh-huh.

47:27.470 --> 47:29.639
-Tomorrow...
-Yeah.

47:29.681 --> 47:31.182
...during the teacher's union
meeting,

47:31.224 --> 47:33.059
it might be nice
if you don't only take photos

47:33.101 --> 47:34.852
with the billionaire boys club.

47:34.894 --> 47:38.147
Maybe take some shots with
the people in the community.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.400
We don't want them forgetting
where you're from.

47:40.441 --> 47:43.152
You don't have any idea
where I'm from.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.947
-Um, I apologize.
-Just...

47:45.989 --> 47:48.992
Can you please close the door?
Thank you.

47:49.033 --> 47:51.327
Sure.

48:00.336 --> 48:03.047
Hey.

48:03.089 --> 48:05.091
Hi.

48:07.176 --> 48:10.138
Are you okay?

48:10.179 --> 48:12.181
What's wrong?

48:12.223 --> 48:14.225
Nothing.

48:28.448 --> 48:30.742
Politics.
