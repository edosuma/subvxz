01:12.197 --> 01:13.739
You wanna hear the real story?

01:13.740 --> 01:16.469
I'm the one you wanna talk to:
Tommy DeVito. Wasn't for me,

01:16.470 --> 01:19.704
we would have wound up in the trunk of
somebody's car with a bullet in our head.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.581
There's even a street named after me.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.165
Of course, it don't come easy.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.419
You gotta have talent
and skill and vision.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.946
And luck.

01:30.048 --> 01:33.497
<i>Just like a wandering sparrow</i>

01:34.011 --> 01:38.166
<i>One lonely soul</i>

01:38.515 --> 01:42.545
<i>I'd walk the straight and narrow</i>

01:42.686 --> 01:46.511
<i>To reach my goal</i>

01:47.065 --> 01:49.684
Frankie. Where's my single?

01:49.943 --> 01:52.016
Coming up, Mr. DeCarlo.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.741
Vito, when are you gonna give
my boy here his own chair?

01:56.742 --> 01:58.326
Ah, he's not ready yet, Gyp.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.230
- Here you go.
- Frankie, you wanna give me a shave?

02:01.455 --> 02:03.122
Yeah, sure.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.321
Give him the razor. Go ahead.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.585
Be careful.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.032
All right.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.005
Soave, Louie.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.341
He's not gonna cut my throat.
Are you, Frankie?

02:13.342 --> 02:15.801
Heh. No, Mr. DeCarlo.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.553
Lot of people would like to, eh?

02:17.554 --> 02:19.422
Get nice and close.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.182
- Hello.
- Ooh.

02:21.183 --> 02:22.767
Party time.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.602
<i>- Dio mio.</i>
- Shit.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.721
- What?
- No, no, no.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.314
It's nothing.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.968
Can you hand me the witch hazel?

02:31.443 --> 02:33.766
Well, I'm sorry.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.363
It's a nick.

02:35.364 --> 02:36.864
I'm sorry, Mr. DeCarlo.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.367
Maybe you should phone ahead, Tommy?

02:39.368 --> 02:41.202
I'm sorry, Gyp, I didn't figure...

02:41.203 --> 02:43.651
I know. You usually don't.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.206
- Gimme.
- It's a nick.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.833
- I'll finish it.
- Calm down, Vito.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.612
What's a little blood
between friends?

02:51.338 --> 02:53.631
- I'm sorry, Mr. DeCarlo.
- It's all right.

02:53.632 --> 02:54.840
<i>Gyp DeCarlo.</i>

02:54.841 --> 02:58.871
Sure, they had elections. But you wanted
something done or undone in Jersey...

02:59.221 --> 03:01.214
Gyp was the man.

03:01.515 --> 03:05.135
And I gotta say, I had a
special relationship with him.

03:05.268 --> 03:10.564
- Tommy. You pick up my dry cleaning?
- Sure thing, Gyp. It's already at your house.

03:10.565 --> 03:15.403
- Okay. Drop Frankie. Then take me home.
- Right away.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.272
You doing your exercises?

03:17.489 --> 03:18.698
Yeah.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.852
A voice like yours,
it's a gift from God.

03:22.327 --> 03:25.105
The world is gonna hear
that voice. You understand?

03:25.288 --> 03:27.707
Sure, Mr. DeCarlo. It's just...

03:27.708 --> 03:29.155
What?

03:29.418 --> 03:32.412
I don't know. I just wish
things would start to happen.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.964
- Impatient, huh?
- Heh.

03:34.965 --> 03:38.551
Don't worry. You work hard,
everything follows.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.219
Am I right, Tommy?

03:40.220 --> 03:43.794
Bigger than Sinatra, Gyp.
My hand to God.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.851
There were three ways
out of the neighborhood:

03:46.852 --> 03:49.880
You join the Army,
maybe you get killed.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.857
You get mobbed up,
you might get killed that way.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.692
Or you get famous.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.937
For us, it was two out of three.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.214
It's gonna be good.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.492
- Be careful, huh?
- Bye, Mr. DeCarlo. Yeah.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.520
You know what I don't understand?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.814
I don't understand the infatuation...

04:33.815 --> 04:36.233
with these <i>mamaluke</i> bums.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.194
Because that's what
they are, Frankie.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.989
You hang outwith them,
you either end up dead or in jail.

04:41.990 --> 04:45.910
Eh. She's right, huh? Just listen.
Learn something.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.287
I gotta go.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.039
- Finish your dinner.
- I finished.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.625
I didn't want anybody
to get up. Hello.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.210
- Hey, Tom.
- Mrs. Castelluccio.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.909
- You hungry?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.048
- Where you going?
- We got rehearsal.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.091
We got a rehearsal for this Friday.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.636
- It's a dance at the high school.
- Uh-huh.

05:03.637 --> 05:07.712
- You better not be drinking or using drugs.
- Him? Forget it. He's an angel.

05:08.016 --> 05:11.644
Sounds like one too. Who does he
get that from, you or your wife?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.638
- Not me.
- Not you?

05:14.898 --> 05:16.357
What's that?

05:16.358 --> 05:17.983
- Please.
- What?

05:17.984 --> 05:19.944
You keep an eye on Frankie.

05:19.945 --> 05:23.197
I'll never let anything happen
to Frankie. My hand to God.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.783
For later. Frankie <i>non mang</i>.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.276
Gimme a kiss.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.913
- The two of you. Be careful.
- Meatballs. Mama.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.692
- I want you home 11:00.
- Come here. I love you.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.459
- No later.
- Yeah, good night.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.087
- Okay, be careful you two, please.
- Yeah.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.755
Eleven o'clock, Frank.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.006
Good night.

05:50.016 --> 05:53.269
All right, Frankie. You look,
you listen. You understand?

05:53.270 --> 05:55.047
What's the high sign?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.881
"Silhouettes."

05:57.357 --> 05:59.225
All right. Come on.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.698
All right, don't screw this up.
Understand? It's for real.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.521
Real casual-like.

06:19.087 --> 06:22.131
Come on, come on, go. Push.
Push the fucking thing.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.834
I am pushing the fucking thing.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.352
<i>Took a walk and passed your house</i>

06:35.353 --> 06:36.896
<i>Late last night</i>

06:36.897 --> 06:38.981
<i>From within, a dim light cast...</i>

06:38.982 --> 06:41.984
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey, Officer Mike. How you doing?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.611
What's with the concert?

06:43.612 --> 06:44.987
Oh, it's, um...

06:44.988 --> 06:48.115
Good acoustics, so the sound
bounces off the wall there.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.451
Aren't you supposed to be home by 11?

06:50.452 --> 06:51.785
You want the truth?

06:51.786 --> 06:54.538
It's my girl. She lives there.
I'm wooing her.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.415
- Wooing, huh?
- Yeah.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.083
Making love with music.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.002
<i>Silhouettes

07:03.715 --> 07:05.007
<i>Silhouettes

07:05.008 --> 07:08.332
Hey! Down there! Shut the hell up!
We're trying to sleep!

07:08.762 --> 07:10.262
Her mother don't like me.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.766
Okay, nice try. Why don't you get out
of here before I gotta run you in?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.510
Yeah, sure, Mikey.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.046
Sorry for the disturbance.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.598
Watch my... Come on.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.198
- Okay, come on.
- Slow, slow.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.700
You couldn't open it inside,
how you gonna open it at home?

07:31.701 --> 07:33.702
- We can't open up...
- Shut up and push.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.071
- Get in, get in.
- Come on.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.239
Fuck! Your mother's ass!

07:41.878 --> 07:43.746
Come on. Go, go, go!

07:45.131 --> 07:48.250
Come on. Frankie,
step on the fucking gas.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.580
Shit. Oh, shit.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.931
- What are you doing?
- Frankie!

07:53.932 --> 07:56.892
Straighten it out! Frankie,
what are you doing? Frankie!

07:56.893 --> 07:58.519
- I can't!
- Stop the fucking car!

08:02.232 --> 08:03.899
- Frankie!
- Jackass!

08:03.900 --> 08:05.317
Oh, man!

08:12.242 --> 08:13.826
Holy shit.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.856
Come on, come on, let's go!

08:20.625 --> 08:22.242
You all right?

Thank you very much,

09:14.054 --> 09:17.139
Before I bring out the Vienna
Boys Choir and Topo Gigio...

09:20.018 --> 09:23.062
I would love to introduce you
to a new discovery of mine:

09:23.063 --> 09:24.680
Little Frankie Castelluccio.

Frankie, get on up here.
Come on, don't be shy.

You want your shot? Fucking sing.

Come on.

09:35.950 --> 09:42.232

He is so good.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.638
Go ahead. Just say "good night."

10:39.639 --> 10:41.165
Good night.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.643
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.888
Thank you all for coming.
Hope you enjoyed your evening.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.065
Anybody seen my lighter?

10:50.066 --> 10:51.275
Look who it is.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.235
- What do you want?
- Hey, Frankie.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.612
You sang good tonight.
It was good, not great.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.030
They seemed to like it.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.117
Yeah? Look what we got over here.
We got an audience expert.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.286
- I'll tell you when they like it.
- I'm just saying.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.955
Maybe you shouldn't say so
much and start listening, huh?

11:04.956 --> 11:06.582
- Move, move.
- What?

11:06.583 --> 11:08.542
You see the redhead in the front row?

11:08.543 --> 11:10.195
It's not under there.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.996
I seen her clocking you.
You can get in.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.424
- Nah. She was with somebody.
- Oh, yeah?

11:16.718 --> 11:19.667
- So you take her for a spin.
- Like in what?

11:19.929 --> 11:21.831
Taking her in the Plymouth.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.017
- You gonna lend me your car?
- I might lend you the car.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.226
Bullshit.

11:26.227 --> 11:30.063
Just don't wrap yourself around a tree.
I don't have to fill out a lot of forms.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.690
Look. He's chomping at the bit.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.595
What's a matter with you? Sit. There's
a couple things you gotta know first.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.029
I don't have time for this shit.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.781
There's two types of women.
There's Type A and Type B.

11:39.782 --> 11:43.535
Type A, they're real easy. They jump
right into bed with you. Boom, boom, boom.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.412
Then later on, they break your balls.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.789
Then there's Type B.
Ask Nicky about Type B.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.083
Tell him about Type B.
You gotta wine them, dine them.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.336
- Then what do they do?
- Break your balls.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.865
They bust-a the balls.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.715
- I don't get it.
- You don't get it.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.592
You see this face? He don't get it.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.135
Don't worry. You will.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.221
- You want the car? Huh?
- Yeah.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.307
Yeah? Look at him. He's going for it.
What do you wanna do? Oosh!

12:05.308 --> 12:07.643
- Oh, Frankie. Oh, Frankie.
- Oh.

12:07.644 --> 12:11.730
What's a matter? Come on, you wanna fight?
You wanna go, big man with the ladies?

12:11.731 --> 12:14.149
- Come here. Let's go. Like this.
- Come on, Tommy.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.235
Like this. Like this.
He's hooking. He's hooking.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.697
- What happened?
- Don't do that. Don't hit me, man.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.742
- Oh, there he is.
- Don't do that. Don't hit me.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.827
He took a swing. Ha-ha-ha.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.247
- All right. He's a slugger.
- Come on, man.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.790
- Let go of me!
- Eh. Eh!

12:29.791 --> 12:31.568
Listen to me, all right?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.445
Come on, little brother.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.255
I ain't your little brother.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.882
Frankie. Calm down.

12:38.883 --> 12:42.427
This kid takes everything so serious.
You want the car? Take the car.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.679
Here. It's on me. Here.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.128
You have the car. All right?
Enjoy yourself.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.426
Enjoy the little porcelain doll.
All right?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.646
So where you wanna go?

12:52.647 --> 12:55.015
I don't know. Where do you wanna go?

12:55.692 --> 12:56.900
Mexico?

12:58.069 --> 13:00.529
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey, Officer Mike.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.103
Detectives would like to
have a word with you.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.414
That jog your memory?

13:10.415 --> 13:13.041
You're underage. Hanging
around the jewelry store.

13:13.042 --> 13:16.128
You give the officer some bullshit
about doing a Romeo act.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.672
I don't know what you're
talking about. Aah!

13:18.673 --> 13:21.216
Tommy and his brother already
gave you up, numbnuts.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.743
Yeah, bullshit.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.921
All right, asshole. Have it your way.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.498
Come on.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.144
How old are you?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.479
Uh, 16, Your Honor.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.316
Your Honor, please, the kid
didn't know what he was doing.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.969
I conned him into it.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.612
I'm letting you off with a warning.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.357
I suggest you get yourself
a new set of friends.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.493
If I see you back in my courtroom
again you're going away.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.362
Now get out of here.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.192
Frankie, sing good, huh?

13:57.337 --> 14:00.206
Frankie. You're the devil.
You know that, Tommy?

14:00.214 --> 14:02.883
Oh, holier than art thou.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.801
Just stay away from my son. Okay?

14:04.802 --> 14:06.636
You stay away from my son, Tommy.

14:06.637 --> 14:08.414
<i>Earth angel</i>

14:13.728 --> 14:16.897
As for you, let's see.
"Gaetano DeVito.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.983
<i>Breaking and entering,
possession of stolen property.</i>

14:19.984 --> 14:22.319
Possession of stolen property,
breaking and entering.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.072
Possession of a forged document,
breaking and entering.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.573
Illegal gaming."

14:26.574 --> 14:28.146
That's quite a résumé.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.270
Thank you, Your Honor.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.523
So the kid's a singer?

14:34.082 --> 14:35.654
He's a good singer.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.293
And he's getting better every day.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.994
Then he ought to be great by the
time you get out. Six months.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.773
- Teach him.
- Yeah, okay.

14:59.774 --> 15:03.428
And watch him. Anything happens
to Frankie, you got a problem with me.

15:04.445 --> 15:08.698
So it's back to the joint. Rahway Correctional.
They got a revolving door on this place.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.101
Somebody from the
neighborhood's always inside.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.285
Welcome back, Tommy.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.787
- You get a promotion?
- Yeah.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.372
- How's life?
- Not too bad.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.957
- Yourself?
- All right.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.250
You're looking good.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.903
Who's the new guy?

15:23.214 --> 15:24.673
Nicky.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.551
For God's sakes, I thought
we were going to the movies.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.136
Relax, will you?

15:29.137 --> 15:31.138
But I wanna see The Blob.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.932
Two minutes. Sit down.
Read the Bible. Improve your mind.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.676
Frankie, come on.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.396
Ooh.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.439
Nicky!

15:50.658 --> 15:52.784
- Okay, you remember the words?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.984
Now don't push. A little
more from the inside.

15:59.625 --> 16:05.782
<i>I want a</i>

16:07.425 --> 16:10.578
<i>Sunday kind of love</i>

16:11.471 --> 16:17.799
<i>A love to last past Saturday night</i>

16:17.935 --> 16:23.808
<i>I'm glad to know
It's more than love at first sight</i>

16:24.150 --> 16:27.269
<i>I want a Sunday kind of love</i>

16:28.279 --> 16:32.824
<i>Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh</i>

16:32.825 --> 16:36.203
<i>- I do my Sunday dreaming
- I do my Sunday dreaming</i>

16:36.204 --> 16:38.872
<i>- And all my Sunday scheming
- And all my Sunday scheming</i>

16:38.873 --> 16:40.332
<i>- Every minute

16:40.333 --> 16:42.125
<i>- Every hour
- Every hour</i>

16:42.126 --> 16:45.212
<i>- Every day

16:45.213 --> 16:48.340
<i>- I'm hoping to discover

16:48.341 --> 16:51.051
<i>- A certain kind of lover
- A certain kind of lover</i>

16:51.052 --> 16:53.220
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

16:57.433 --> 16:58.642
There.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.894
I told you it wasn't no vision.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.021
Hey, Nicky. Frankie.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.566
- Hey, Stanley. Sister, looking good.
- What, you breaking into a church?

17:06.567 --> 17:09.319
- You're on parole, for chrissake.
- Come on, Stanley.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.946
- Gimme your hands.
- I guess this means good night.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.491
At least I'll know where
your hands are gonna be.

17:14.492 --> 17:18.036
- Need some help there, Stanley?
- You take him, you gotta take me too.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.414
- Aren't you supposed to be home?
- Don't bend the suit. It's imported.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.875
Work on that B flat, Frankie.
Chest voice.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.835
And do your exercises.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.547
Stanley, take it easy.
We're walking out of a church.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.200
Let's get out of here.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.594
- Hey, easy.
- Come on. Out. Out.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.338
Hey, princess.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.682
Hey, Tommooch.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.255
Machoch.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.936
So as I'm getting out,
Nick is going in.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.397
And the Variety Trio is now a single.

17:45.398 --> 17:49.109
Ain't gotta be no Einstein to see there
ain't no future for me as a single.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.278
So I make an executive decision.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.405
I put Frankie in the band.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.824
Hey, Greg. How are you?

18:01.706 --> 18:07.502
<i>My arms need someone to enfold</i>

18:07.503 --> 18:10.797
<i>To keep me warm when</i>

18:10.798 --> 18:13.701
<i>Mondays are cold</i>

18:14.468 --> 18:16.136
Come on. Let's get out of here.

18:16.137 --> 18:19.086
Hey. Cool your <i>coglioni</i>.
I'm listening.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.756
Look at that son of
a bitch over there.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.313
- Where?
- That guy. The big guy. Hitting on my girl.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.685
That's not your girl.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.571
She will be as soon as she meets me.

18:34.572 --> 18:39.102
That's Mary Delgado. She'll eat you alive.
They'll send you home in an envelope.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.995
Come on, Tommy. I'm in love.

18:41.996 --> 18:45.081
<i>I want a Sunday</i>

18:45.082 --> 18:52.491
<i>Kind of love</i>

18:55.092 --> 18:58.762
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
We hope you enjoyed the evening.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.264
Special night having
you here and drink up.

19:04.268 --> 19:07.387
And then, get lost.
We got a second show at 10.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.599
Come on. Can you introduce
me now, or what?

19:12.943 --> 19:16.017
Do me a favor. <i>'Stu cazzo</i>
in the red tie? Get rid of him.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.826
- Okay, friend. It's your bedtime.
- Who are you?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.570
I'm Mother Goose.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.196
Mary.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.963
Hey, Tommooch.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.911
Mr. Subtle, huh?

19:36.217 --> 19:38.301
And you didn't even bat an eye.

19:38.302 --> 19:42.332
Frankie, this is Mary Delgado.
Mary Delgado, this is Frankie Vally.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.795
Hi.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.425
How are you?

19:45.559 --> 19:48.061
All right. Slow down, okay?
The kid's barely legal.

19:48.062 --> 19:50.385
Since when do you care about legal?

19:51.607 --> 19:53.259
Hey, come here. Come on.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.943
Listen to me.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.237
This is Type A,
you understand? Type A.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.891
- Yeah, yeah. I got it.
- This is a hit-and-run.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.150
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, man.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.229
Have a good time.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.195
You know, that's a
nice color for you.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.612
- You should always wear that.
- Thanks for the fashion tip.

20:15.089 --> 20:19.084
So, what do you say
we get out of here?

20:29.603 --> 20:33.098
- So this is a pretty nice place, huh?
- Yeah.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.306
They don't sell slices.
That's how you can tell.

20:37.278 --> 20:40.147
- So that's your real name? Vally?
- No.

20:40.156 --> 20:43.742
Castelluccio. Francis Castelluccio.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.535
Kind of long for a marquee.

20:45.536 --> 20:50.191
- That's why I changed it. Vally. V-A-L-L-Y.
- No.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.334
- V-A-L-L-I.
- How come?

20:53.335 --> 20:55.128
Because "Y" is a bullshit letter.

20:55.129 --> 20:58.578
It doesn't know what it is.
Is it a vowel? Is it a consonant?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.717
Never thought about it.

21:00.718 --> 21:03.871
Plus which, you're Italian.
You gotta end in a vowel.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.673
Delgad-O. Castellucci-O.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.266
Pizz-A.

21:08.267 --> 21:12.513
Valli with an "I." It says "This is who I am.
You don't like it, go fuck yourself."

21:14.940 --> 21:16.649
Ah.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.394
That's a very unusual fragrance.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.447
I never smelled that before.
What do you call it?

21:22.448 --> 21:23.895
Soap.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.786
Tommy warned me about you.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.287
Yeah? What'd he say?

21:29.288 --> 21:32.532
- He said I couldn't handle you.
- That's because he couldn't.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.211
So your group...?

21:36.212 --> 21:38.797
- The Varietones.
- Yeah. Just you and Tommy?

21:38.798 --> 21:39.964
And his brother, Nick...

21:39.965 --> 21:42.493
- ...and this other guy, Nicky.
- So where were they?

21:43.052 --> 21:45.329
They went away for a while.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.297
What for?

21:47.890 --> 21:49.837
They did some things.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.925
With friends like that, maybe you should
just change your name to Sinatra.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.606
I'm gonna be as big as Sinatra.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.884
Only if you stand on a chair.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.893
Hey, why you gotta
say that kind of stuff?

22:04.114 --> 22:07.742
Look, first of all, Sinatra wouldn't
be caught dead in that jacket.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.244
Where'd you get it?

22:09.245 --> 22:12.372
- I don't know. Tommy got it off a truck.
- Exactly.

22:12.373 --> 22:16.368
Tommy's a two-bit hustler.
He doesn't see the big picture.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.029
Yeah? So what do I do?

22:19.588 --> 22:21.080
Come here.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.961
You got a nickel?

22:35.563 --> 22:36.771
Yeah.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.516
Call your mother.
You're gonna be home late.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.405
All right!

23:01.797 --> 23:04.465
- Attaboy, Frankie.
- You look beautiful, Mary!

23:04.466 --> 23:07.540
Quick and painless.
Quick and painless.

23:17.146 --> 23:20.023
Mary had a couple of years on
him and they both wanted out.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.357
Up and out.

23:21.358 --> 23:24.652
Mary saw Frankie as her chance,
and she poured it all into him.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.145
Love?

23:26.155 --> 23:29.699
I'll be honest with you.
I never knew what that was.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.226
Marriage?

23:31.452 --> 23:33.445
Marriage is not love.

23:33.871 --> 23:38.777
Marriage is you take a shave while your
wife sits on the can and clips her toenails.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.755
<i>Anyway, Frankie's married.</i>

23:43.756 --> 23:46.674
<i>We're playing nights,
Frankie's cutting hair in the daytime.</i>

23:46.675 --> 23:50.303
<i>And it's their anniversary, and he
decides to get Mary some jewelry.</i>

23:50.304 --> 23:52.889
<i>So he goes shopping, Jersey style.</i>

23:52.890 --> 23:56.225
I don't understand. Why can't this
guy bring stuff over the house?

23:56.226 --> 23:57.769
He's a little nervous.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.896
Your wife's gonna love
this shit, Frankie.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.856
Couple of watches. Nice diamonds.

24:01.857 --> 24:05.068
He got it out of some house in Saddle River.
He had to smack the broad around.

24:05.069 --> 24:07.187
- But she'll live.
- Would you shut up?

24:07.905 --> 24:10.148
He don't need to know all that.

24:10.324 --> 24:12.408
Frankie's cool. Right, Frankie?

24:12.409 --> 24:13.952
Yeah, no problem.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.570
Wait a minute.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.748
This isn't Bloomfield.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.083
No, it's Fairfield.

24:20.084 --> 24:23.419
Not Fairfield, you fucking asshole.
Bloomfield.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.754
You said Fairfield.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.090
Why would I say Fairfield
if it was Bloomfield?

24:27.091 --> 24:30.051
Maybe your brain is fucked up.
And don't call me an asshole.

24:30.052 --> 24:32.804
Why? It's what you are.
A piece of shit fucking asshole.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.139
- Hey, fellas, it's okay.
- You stay out of this!

24:35.140 --> 24:36.975
Hey! Don't get out of line.

24:36.976 --> 24:41.020
No! Fuck him! And fuck you! Okay?
I'm not the asshole! You're the asshole!

24:41.021 --> 24:42.981
Don't you call me
an asshole, asshole!

24:42.982 --> 24:45.900
Oh, yeah. And what are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

24:45.901 --> 24:47.777
- What am I gonna do about it?
- Asshole.

24:47.778 --> 24:50.101
- Yeah, yeah.
- How about this?

24:54.702 --> 24:56.703
Holy shit!

24:56.704 --> 24:58.162
What are you, crazy?

24:58.163 --> 25:00.156
Now who's the asshole?

25:01.166 --> 25:03.918
- Jeez, Donnie, my God!
- Get out. Get out!

25:03.919 --> 25:08.119
Get out! I'll call you tomorrow.
Come on. I'll take care of this. Go!

25:08.132 --> 25:10.159
Go! Go! Frankie, go!

25:20.102 --> 25:23.146
Aw. You should have seen his face.
I almost felt sorry for the kid.

25:23.147 --> 25:26.691
Yeah, well, don't. We gotta
lean on him. And hard.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.985
We need that money, Donnie. Okay?

25:28.986 --> 25:30.319
Asshole.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.222
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha. Get in the front.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.369
What are you, deaf? Open it.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.364
Put the plate down
and open it. Open it!

25:41.457 --> 25:42.749
What if it's your wife?

25:42.750 --> 25:45.573
Don't worry about it.
Just open the fucking door.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.320
Tommy.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.290
Tommy, something
terrible just happened.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.244
Agh. Slow down.

25:53.844 --> 25:56.137
So he shot somebody in your car...

25:56.138 --> 25:58.765
and they charge you $20,000
to make it go away?

25:58.766 --> 26:00.213
Twenty-five.

26:01.769 --> 26:05.093
Sweetheart, gimme a kiss,
go powder your nose.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.804
So let me ask you something.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.027
If he shot the guy,
why should you pay?

26:11.028 --> 26:14.530
What are you, nuts? It's my car.
There's a dead guy in it.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.492
My prints are all over. The cops are
gonna trace it. It's a murder rap.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.327
Frankie, it's a scam.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.620
What?

26:20.621 --> 26:23.956
They fake a murder in your car,
then charge you to make it go away.

26:23.957 --> 26:26.530
There was blood.
I saw it with my own eyes.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.753
Eh?

26:28.754 --> 26:30.827
- Or fake blood, like in the movies.
- Huh?

26:31.131 --> 26:34.008
- Shit.
- Let me explain something to you, all right?

26:34.009 --> 26:37.095
You shoot somebody, you gotta
shoot all the witnesses too.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.513
That's a basic rule.

26:38.514 --> 26:43.142
I bet you $100 your car is sitting in his
driveway right now. Hundred dollars, I bet you.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.170
But Donnie's my friend.

26:45.187 --> 26:47.480
And I'm not your friend? Huh?

26:47.481 --> 26:49.774
- I'm your friend.
- All right.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.392
Fuck Donnie.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.845
Now go home. I'll take care of it.

26:55.656 --> 26:59.867
- What are you gonna do, call Gyp?
- Are you <i>stunade</i> ? You mention that name?

26:59.868 --> 27:03.021
You don't bother Gyp DeCarlo
with two-bit bullshit.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.907
I said I'll take care of it,
all right? Go home.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.667
Take care of your wife.

27:07.668 --> 27:10.196
Thanks, Tommy. I owe you.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.426
What am I gonna do with you?

27:17.427 --> 27:19.329
Huh?

27:19.471 --> 27:20.963
Stupid.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.462
You said it, Gyp.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.259
Take off your hat.

27:32.484 --> 27:37.738
Okay, I'll say it once, so get
it through your thick skulls.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.824
Frankie is my friend. <i>Capisce?</i>

27:39.825 --> 27:43.578
You don't touch him, you don't speak
to him, you don't even dream about him.

27:43.579 --> 27:47.483
If you see him coming toward you,
you cross the street.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.869
But if he trips, you better
be there to catch him.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.379
Hmm?

27:53.380 --> 27:55.703
And now, get out of here.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.120
You're being watched, friends.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.797
Thank you, Tommy.

28:11.148 --> 28:16.600
<i>God's gift from up above</i>

28:16.737 --> 28:21.984
<i>A real unselfish love</i>

28:22.534 --> 28:28.282
<i>I've found in my</i>

28:28.957 --> 28:33.533
<i>Mother's eyes</i>

28:43.388 --> 28:46.007
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.263
He's good. Yeah. He's very good.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.258
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.

29:00.781 --> 29:05.076
I appreciate you sang that, Frankie.
It was my mother's favorite song.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.161
Oh, please. My pleasure, Mr. DeCarlo.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.705
By the way, you get your car back?

29:09.706 --> 29:11.040
My car? Yeah.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.417
Those guys, they went away?

29:13.418 --> 29:14.794
Yeah.

29:14.795 --> 29:17.163
You're a good boy, Frankie.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.260
Frankie, here's your claim check.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.762
Anytime you got a problem...

29:24.763 --> 29:26.836
you reach out to me.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.961
- Mm?
- All right.

29:31.561 --> 29:33.838
- Beautiful tonight.
- Thanks.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.025
You got something to say? Huh?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.973
Hmm?

29:40.195 --> 29:41.687
Good.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.867
For years, I'm humping DeCarlo's
laundry, he treats me like a bum.

29:46.868 --> 29:50.288
Frankie sings one song,
he gets a claim check.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.832
I'll tell you,
it's good to be lead singer.

29:52.833 --> 29:56.157
Anyway, Nick Massi finally
revolves out of Rahway.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.629
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.415
Look at you.

30:02.092 --> 30:04.176
Look at this guy.
Like you never left.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.553
Tom mooch.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.206
Frankie.

30:08.307 --> 30:12.018
So it's me, Nick and Frankie. And it's
up to me to keep us out of the gutter.

30:12.019 --> 30:15.343
But nobody's hiring trios anymore.
Trios are dead.

30:15.897 --> 30:19.608
The fact is, I'm all out of ideas.
But I could still do math.

30:19.609 --> 30:23.904
Three Lovers equals zero bookings. So to
generate some walking around money...

30:23.905 --> 30:28.060
I'm working with this kid on a
project at a local establishment.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.452
<i>- Who wears short shorts?
- We wear short shorts</i>

30:38.211 --> 30:40.329
<i>They're such short shorts</i>

30:42.799 --> 30:45.593
- Hey, you listening?
- Yeah. Tommy, I'm working. Come on.

30:45.594 --> 30:46.802
You being a wiseass?

30:46.803 --> 30:50.473
After the fifth frame you start
spotting the pins like we said. Right?

30:50.474 --> 30:52.501
Yeah, I know, a little off.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.978
So listen. We got this
jazz group, you know.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.522
We're playing up in
Bergenfield with this kid.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.776
Tommy, this kid. He plays like
a madman. He writes songs.

31:01.777 --> 31:04.111
I'm thinking this is the
guy you're looking for.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.654
- Yeah, for what?
- "For what?"

31:05.655 --> 31:08.157
For the group. The band,
the Lovers, the Romans...

31:08.158 --> 31:13.439
whatever the hell the name is
this week. Tommy, this is his song.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.498
<i>Who wears short shorts</i>

31:15.499 --> 31:18.125
<i>Boom, boom, boom
We wear short shorts</i>

31:19.878 --> 31:23.464
I told you! I warned you! I swear I'm
gonna come over, you motherfucker!

31:23.465 --> 31:26.342
Lucky you got a split!
I'm gonna split open your head!

31:26.343 --> 31:29.303
Joey. Pay attention, huh?
Can we take care of our business?

31:29.304 --> 31:32.515
We take care of business,
then we talk about you being a scout.

31:32.516 --> 31:33.974
Yeah, sure, Tommy.

31:33.975 --> 31:37.595
Listen. You don't screw this up,
there's a C-note in it for you.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.522
What's his name?

31:39.523 --> 31:43.484
Gaudio. Bob Gaudio. If you want,
I can arrange a sit-down.

31:43.485 --> 31:46.388
I handle the sit-downs.
Keep taking care of the pins.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.865
Tommy, the kid's a genius.
You're gonna thank me for this.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.158
And don't forget:

31:51.159 --> 31:52.936
I discovered him.

31:53.829 --> 31:55.830
Yeah, that Joe Pesci.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.957
The film actor. Who knew?

31:57.958 --> 32:01.335
I played the thing down about Gaudio.
I like to keep my game face on.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.921
But in here, bells are
going off big time.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.715
Some kid from outta nowhere
who sings, plays and writes?

32:06.716 --> 32:09.635
Come on. You sign him up, man.
You just hit the trifecta.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.643
Bobby, listen. Three Lovers
looking for a fourth.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.437
- Who?
- The Three Lovers.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.773
They got rid of this yutz who was
doing monkey songs or some shit.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.109
- Ha, ha, ha. That's funny.
- Funny how?

32:25.110 --> 32:27.445
No, I... Look, why are
you telling me this?

32:27.446 --> 32:30.406
Because I told him you're
a freaking genius.

32:30.407 --> 32:33.784
Hey. Don't forget. I discovered you.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.912
Good. Uh, look, I'm in the middle
of something right now, okay?

32:36.913 --> 32:39.123
- Are you kidding me? Let's go.
- Now?

32:39.124 --> 32:41.125
Yeah. No, next week.
Yeah, we gotta go.

32:42.878 --> 32:46.338
<i>I'm in the mood for love</i>

32:46.339 --> 32:51.886
<i>Simply because you're near me</i>

32:51.887 --> 32:54.346
Joey, come on. This is
like for my grandparents.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.639
Wait. Will you relax?

32:55.640 --> 32:56.932
Trust me.

32:56.933 --> 33:02.305
<i>I'm in the mood for love</i>

33:06.443 --> 33:10.196
<i>There I go, there I go, there I go</i>

33:10.197 --> 33:13.020
<i>There I go</i>

33:13.200 --> 33:20.164
<i>Pretty baby, you are the soul
Who snaps my control</i>

33:20.165 --> 33:23.489
<i>Such a funny thing
But every time I'm near you</i>

33:23.668 --> 33:26.170
<i>I never can behave</i>

33:26.171 --> 33:31.467
<i>You give me a smile
And then I'm wrapped up in your magic</i>

33:31.468 --> 33:32.843
I heard them all:

33:32.844 --> 33:36.305
Jackie Wilson, Johnny
Mathis, Dinah Washington.

33:36.306 --> 33:39.266
But I never heard a voice
like Frankie Valli's.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.340
After 30 seconds...

33:41.811 --> 33:44.930
I know I need to
write for this voice.

33:46.566 --> 33:50.061
<i>I'm in the mood for</i>

33:50.487 --> 33:55.438
<i>Love</i>

33:57.869 --> 33:59.361
All right.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.372
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.820
- Right?
- Yeah.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.209
<i>Hey, fellas.</i>

34:05.210 --> 34:06.752
Fabulous. Man, what a set.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.754
Bob Gaudio, the guy
I was talking about.

34:08.755 --> 34:11.632
Tommy DeVito, Bobby. I run
the group. You're out late, huh?

34:11.632 --> 34:14.467
I was telling him about how you
guys were looking for a...

34:14.469 --> 34:16.719
Joey. Don't get overexcited, huh?

34:16.721 --> 34:18.293
Yeah, sorry.

34:19.181 --> 34:21.835
Nick Massi, Frankie Valli,
Bob... What is it?

34:22.060 --> 34:24.212
- Gaudio. Hi.
- Where you from?

34:25.021 --> 34:27.063
Uh, Bergenfield.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.649
Somebody said you write?

34:28.650 --> 34:31.402
I told you. "Short Shorts."
Number two with a bullet.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.679
Sorry. Shut up, Joey.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.241
All right, call me.
We'll set up a meet.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.159
Hey, come on. Kid's here,
we're here, let's do it.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.621
Yeah, Tommy, he's got a new one.
This stuff just pours out of him.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.320
I'm just saying.

34:49.462 --> 34:50.879
All right, do what you do.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.327
Thank you.

35:05.562 --> 35:09.637
<i>I cried for you</i>

35:11.610 --> 35:14.058
<i>Now cry for me</i>

35:17.157 --> 35:22.995
<i>No, no, I don't love you anymore</i>

35:22.996 --> 35:28.208
<i>Cry for me</i>

35:28.209 --> 35:30.669
<i>Well, you had your fun</i>

35:30.670 --> 35:33.869

35:33.965 --> 35:36.300
<i>With someone new</i>

35:36.301 --> 35:39.678
<i>Don't go, baby</i>

35:39.679 --> 35:41.764
<i>Girl, now you want
me to take you back</i>

35:41.765 --> 35:45.392
<i>Don't go, baby</i>

35:45.393 --> 35:49.548
<i>We're all through</i>

35:50.190 --> 35:54.766
<i>'Cause now I'm leaving</i>

35:56.071 --> 35:58.519
<i>No, no, make believin'</i>

36:02.118 --> 36:05.943
<i>You made a fool of me</i>

36:06.081 --> 36:11.794
<i>So now I'm leaving you</i>

36:11.795 --> 36:13.379
<i>I</i>

36:13.380 --> 36:15.339
<i>Love you so</i>

36:15.340 --> 36:18.243
<i>Don't go, baby</i>

36:18.677 --> 36:21.011
<i>Much more than you'll ever know</i>

36:21.012 --> 36:24.640
<i>Don't go, baby</i>

36:24.641 --> 36:27.059
<i>But you just cheated and you lied</i>

36:27.060 --> 36:29.645
<i>Don't go, baby</i>

36:29.646 --> 36:34.472
<i>Go on and cry for me</i>

36:34.776 --> 36:38.779
<i>Well, you knew it from the start</i>

36:38.780 --> 36:42.658
<i>Someday you'd break my heart</i>

36:42.659 --> 36:45.411
<i>Now we're all through</i>

36:45.412 --> 36:46.829
<i>Go on and</i>

36:46.830 --> 36:49.358
<i>- So cry

36:50.667 --> 36:52.501
<i>- Cry for me

36:52.502 --> 36:53.669
<i>- Cry
- For me baby?</i>

36:53.670 --> 36:55.212
<i>Won't you cry for me, baby?</i>

36:55.213 --> 36:56.463
<i>Cry</i>

36:56.464 --> 36:58.966
<i>- Just the way I cried for you
- Cry, Cry</i>

36:58.967 --> 37:01.093
<i>Won't you cry for me, baby?</i>

37:01.094 --> 37:03.595
<i>- Cry
- Just the way I cried over you</i>

37:03.596 --> 37:07.141
<i>- Cry

<i>Ooh, ee, ooh, ee, ooh</i>

37:29.497 --> 37:30.706
Right? Yeah.

37:30.707 --> 37:33.360
- Give us a minute, all right?
- Yeah. Thank you.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.423
What do you think?

37:39.424 --> 37:42.873
Well, I don't know.
He writes and he sounds great.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.250
What do you think, Tommy?

37:45.722 --> 37:46.930
Thanks.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.208
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

37:49.350 --> 37:53.854
Hi. Um. So I was just
wondering if, um...

37:53.855 --> 37:56.774
Who's, like, the girl in your song?

37:56.775 --> 37:59.234
I mean, do you have a girlfriend?

37:59.235 --> 38:02.780
Oh, no. No. It's any girl,
it's every girl.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.616
It's what T.S. Eliot calls
"the objective correlative."

38:05.617 --> 38:08.285
I felt like you were singing to me.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.662
You're not from around here, are you?

38:10.663 --> 38:12.790
Probably somewhere
really exotic, though.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.459
- Like Europe.
- All right, we gotta talk.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.961
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, ladies.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.214
- Hi, how are you?
- So good.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.840
Good. I'll tell you what.

38:21.841 --> 38:24.635
I'm gonna shut my eyes,
and I'm gonna count to three.

38:24.636 --> 38:30.509
When I open them, you're gonna disappear.
Ready? One. Two. Three.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.437
- And they're gone.
- Heh.

38:35.438 --> 38:38.649
So you got an agent? A manager?
Somebody does your deals?

38:38.650 --> 38:40.192
It's okay. You can talk to me.

38:40.193 --> 38:42.641
- You sure?
- Yeah.

38:42.946 --> 38:46.073
Tell you what. We're gonna hire
you on a trial basis, all right?

38:46.074 --> 38:50.229
Let's say three weeks, $25 a
week and we see how it goes.

38:50.954 --> 38:53.247
- Oh, that's not gonna work.
- And why not?

38:53.248 --> 38:55.616
I was thinking I would come in equal.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.042
Really?

38:57.043 --> 38:59.419
Plus, I retain publishing
on anything I write.

38:59.420 --> 39:03.450
And we can work out a favored nations
on any mechanical and ancillary rights.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.295
Excuse me a minute.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.809
- Forget it.
- Why?

39:13.810 --> 39:16.061
He wants a four-way split.
In his dreams.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.772
Well, Tommy, this kid's good.

39:18.773 --> 39:22.442
You think this kid is the golden goose?
He wrote one fucking song.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.112
Gonna cut him in equal?
There's a million out there.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.321
Where?

39:26.322 --> 39:28.532
- Where what?
- The million guys. Where?

39:28.533 --> 39:30.534
- Can I just say something here?
- No.

39:30.535 --> 39:34.121
- Tommy, I like him.
- You got a hard-on for this kid?

39:34.122 --> 39:36.039
Look at him. He can't drink,
he can't smoke.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.375
He ain't never been laid before.
What good is he?

39:38.376 --> 39:41.211
You think he's green, take him under
your wing like you did with me.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.588
You want to cut him in equal?

39:42.589 --> 39:47.085
If it works, there'll be enough for everybody.
If it doesn't, what's the difference?

39:48.344 --> 39:52.514
I'll tell you what, we don't need a keyboard.
That's my decision. That's the end of it.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.009
All right. Then go get
another lead singer.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.175
What'd you say?

39:59.689 --> 40:01.857
I said get yourself
another lead singer.

40:01.858 --> 40:05.307
What's the matter with you?
What you want, a fucking smack? Huh?

40:05.528 --> 40:07.100
What is this?

40:08.823 --> 40:10.395
Oh, I see.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.117
All right.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.368
I'll tell you what.

40:13.369 --> 40:18.195
We cut him in equal and it goes up in
smoke, don't fucking blame me, all right?

40:20.293 --> 40:23.993
- You all right with this?
- Yeah. Let's give it a try.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.881
I'm gonna deal with you later.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.090
What did I do?

40:27.091 --> 40:28.634
- Gaudio.
- Yeah?

40:28.635 --> 40:30.082
Come here.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.840
You're in the group.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.768
Oh.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.263
Great. Thank you. Thanks.

40:43.066 --> 40:44.513
Let's grab a drink.

40:44.943 --> 40:49.029
Music business is a jungle, kid.
You need anything, come to me, all right?

40:49.030 --> 40:50.238
Okay.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.491
- Any time, any place.
- Yeah.

40:52.492 --> 40:54.576
What's your shoe size?

40:54.577 --> 40:55.911
Um...

40:55.912 --> 40:57.484
Ten and a half.

40:57.914 --> 41:01.443
All right. Come over the house
some time. I'll straighten you out.

41:03.419 --> 41:05.754
- So, what size are you again?
- Ten and a half.

41:05.755 --> 41:07.130
Ten and a half.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.091
Look at this. Right here.
Meant to be.

41:09.092 --> 41:10.539
What?

41:11.052 --> 41:12.302
Uh...

41:12.303 --> 41:14.388
Tommy, this is one shoe.

41:14.389 --> 41:17.724
Yeah, it's a left. Yeah,
that's how they ship them. The lefts.

41:17.725 --> 41:21.561
Then a couple of weeks later,
different dock, from Italy, the rights.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.885
The rights are coming in next week.

41:24.232 --> 41:26.441
Tommy, I got enough shoes. Really.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.360
Thank you. I got them.

41:28.361 --> 41:31.196
You want something for your
mother, maybe a nice fur coat?

41:31.197 --> 41:33.490
- Maybe some pearls?
- The pearls are gone.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.243
- Gone? You moved the pearls?
- Yeah, yesterday.

41:36.244 --> 41:37.911
- What'd you do, a Nicky Special?
- Yeah.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.748
Get her a coat, a nice blazer.

41:41.749 --> 41:44.243
Tommy, look, look.
No stolen goods, all right?

41:44.502 --> 41:46.795
Stolen goods?
What, are you kidding me?

41:46.796 --> 41:48.588
- These fell off a truck.
- Big truck.

41:48.589 --> 41:52.426
Look at this kid. Saint Bobby over here,
Nicky, huh, looking down on all of us.

41:52.427 --> 41:53.927
Oh.

41:53.928 --> 41:57.707
This kid. All right, I'll tell you what.
Let's have a toast.

41:58.266 --> 41:59.883
To the group.

42:01.644 --> 42:02.894
Thank you.

42:02.895 --> 42:04.688
There you go. Right to the top.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.440
Chin-chin. A hundred years.

42:07.608 --> 42:09.860
- Cheers.
- Eyes, eyes.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.308
Eyes, Nicky.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.854
I'm gonna jinx the whole damn thing.
I got some good news.

42:16.242 --> 42:17.659
I laid on a limo.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.411
We're going down to Atlantic City.

42:19.412 --> 42:22.873
I got a suite at the Traymore,
we're gonna take in a couple of shows...

42:22.874 --> 42:26.626
- ...have a little party, make a bunch of connects.
- We're gonna pass, Tommy.

42:26.627 --> 42:29.379
What do you mean, pass?
What are you, a quarterback now?

42:29.380 --> 42:33.091
You pass on things? Is that what you do?
When you ever pass on Atlantic City?

42:33.092 --> 42:35.927
- We sent out those demos, you know?
- We who?

42:35.928 --> 42:39.047
Me and Bobby. We're gonna
go into town and follow up.

42:39.182 --> 42:40.432
Oh, you and Bobby?

42:40.433 --> 42:42.476
Nobody's getting any younger
around here, Tommy.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.895
I don't wanna go to a party.
I don't wanna go to Traymore.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.397
I wanna get a record
contract and feed my family.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.766
Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.

42:49.776 --> 42:53.028
What do you think, I'm trying to
take food off your plate? Huh?

42:53.029 --> 42:54.988
All right, go out with the demos.

42:54.989 --> 42:58.784
But you gotta do things the right way.
You talk to me before you do anything.

42:58.785 --> 43:01.912
- Of course, Tommy.
- I'm sorry, was I speaking to you?

43:01.913 --> 43:05.916
Mr. Bobby Businessman. All right, you know
what? You go out with the demos too.

43:05.917 --> 43:09.366
And when you're done, maybe you
could take over General Motors.

43:11.214 --> 43:14.299
All right, Tommy, take it easy.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.077
- We going?
- Yeah, let's go.

43:26.479 --> 43:28.301
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

43:37.907 --> 43:41.743
<i>- Knock me off my feet
- Best years I've shared</i>

43:41.744 --> 43:44.246
<i>And raindrops fell</i>

43:52.547 --> 43:54.415
Oh.

43:57.927 --> 44:00.512
Hi. We're the Four Lovers.
We sent you a demo.

44:00.513 --> 44:02.085
Not interested.

44:05.726 --> 44:07.310
Hi. We're the Four Lovers.

44:07.311 --> 44:09.463
- We sent you a demo...
- Sorry.

44:14.569 --> 44:17.904
- Hi. We're the Four Lovers. We sent you...
- You're the Four Lovers?

44:17.905 --> 44:19.739
- Yeah.
- Well, two of them.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.617
- No, no. Four Lovers is a colored group.
- No, that's us.

44:22.618 --> 44:25.620
<i>I love you so</i>

44:25.621 --> 44:26.788
Not bad.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.566
Come back when you're black.

44:30.543 --> 44:33.420
Get out here, you chickenshit.
I'll rip your throat out!

44:33.421 --> 44:35.839
Hey, Toto, watch your mouth.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.841
You're not in Newark anymore.

44:37.842 --> 44:39.050
Crewe. Ha-ha-ha.

44:39.051 --> 44:43.054
As I live and breathe,
Frankie Castelluccio!

44:43.055 --> 44:46.349
No, it's Valli now. Frankie Valli.
With an "I."

44:46.350 --> 44:47.684
And why not?

44:47.685 --> 44:50.020
- What are you doing here?
- I'm making hit records. You?

44:50.021 --> 44:52.924
We got a new group.
The Four Lovers. Here, take a demo.

44:53.149 --> 44:54.399
Who's your friend?

44:54.400 --> 44:56.735
Ah. The next Otis Blackwell. Heh.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.729
Bob Crewe, Bob Gaudio.

44:59.447 --> 45:02.157
- He's got the best ears in the business.
- They're all right.

45:02.158 --> 45:03.730
Well, hello, young man.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.744
You young, young...

45:06.913 --> 45:09.736
young, young man.

45:11.167 --> 45:12.459
Scorpio.

45:12.460 --> 45:13.752
Gaudio.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.962
No, no, no, silly goose.
Your birthday.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.660
November 17th.

45:17.673 --> 45:19.325
November 12th.

45:20.176 --> 45:23.345
Oh, it's a sign.
The stars are in alignment.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.013
Follow me, boys.

45:25.014 --> 45:27.291
Destiny awaits.

45:28.059 --> 45:31.686
I remember thinking at the time there
was something off about this guy.

45:31.687 --> 45:34.022
I mean, this was like, 1959.

45:34.023 --> 45:36.983
People thought Liberace
was just, you know...

45:36.984 --> 45:38.636
theatrical.

45:41.614 --> 45:44.574
Welcome to civilization, <i>mes enfants.</i>

45:48.871 --> 45:51.831
- Where did he get his drink?
- Vassar.

45:51.832 --> 45:53.279
Hi.

45:54.710 --> 45:56.503
So this is where the magic happens?

45:56.504 --> 45:59.339
No, darling. The magic
happens in the bedroom.

45:59.340 --> 46:02.384
It's not the back seat, but I
prefer a roof over my head.

46:02.385 --> 46:05.345
I'm joking. Go make some friends
and don't get into trouble.

46:05.346 --> 46:08.044
- He's so serious.
- Holy shit.

46:08.182 --> 46:11.226
It's like Jane of the jungle
over there, times two.

46:11.227 --> 46:13.937
- Is that vodka?
- Uh-huh.

46:13.938 --> 46:15.355
Give me a triple.

46:15.356 --> 46:16.803
I'll take a whiskey.

46:18.317 --> 46:21.015
- How much is that?
- Oh, it's free.

46:24.490 --> 46:26.616
It's fascinating, isn't it?

46:26.617 --> 46:28.326
He has such...

46:28.327 --> 46:29.774
freedom.

46:30.121 --> 46:32.148
Hmm.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.207
They should take it away.

46:34.208 --> 46:36.576
- The painting?
- His freedom.

46:42.091 --> 46:45.802
So looks like I forgot
my gold head wrap.

46:46.971 --> 46:49.764
- The best of the best.
- Ah.

46:49.765 --> 46:51.508
So, what do you do?

46:51.600 --> 46:54.378
- Me, I'm a hairdresser.
- Professionally?

46:55.479 --> 46:57.063
Well, during the day.

46:57.064 --> 46:59.149
At night, I put on a
cape and fight crime.

47:00.776 --> 47:04.180
- You're funny. That's funny.
- Thanks.

47:07.283 --> 47:08.935
Good thing I'm married.

47:09.910 --> 47:12.954
So you two room together, is that it?

47:12.955 --> 47:14.998
We do everything together.

47:14.999 --> 47:17.125
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

47:17.126 --> 47:18.743
How old are you?

47:19.545 --> 47:21.504
Together, or separately?

47:32.516 --> 47:35.135
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Shut up.

47:35.644 --> 47:37.020
Like he'll miss it.

47:38.314 --> 47:40.482
<i>Crewe introduced us
to a whole new world.</i>

47:40.483 --> 47:44.527
<i>He signed us to a record contract and
it seemed like we were on our way.</i>

47:44.528 --> 47:46.571
- That was good.
<i>- But we had a problem.</i>

47:48.574 --> 47:49.949
<i>Still care</i>

47:49.950 --> 47:52.702
<i>Still care</i>

47:52.703 --> 47:54.662
<i>I still care for you</i>

47:54.663 --> 47:57.874
<i>- Still care
- Still care</i>

47:57.875 --> 47:59.793
<i>Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i>

47:59.794 --> 48:01.836
We never read the fine print.

48:01.837 --> 48:06.299
The contract had us as backup singers
with an option to record four of our songs.

48:06.300 --> 48:07.592
Crewe's option.

48:07.593 --> 48:11.543
So we spent the next year being the
musical equivalent of room service.

48:11.931 --> 48:18.853
<i>Even in the dark of night
Knowing that you're not in sight</i>

48:18.854 --> 48:23.066
<i>- I still care
- I still care</i>

48:23.067 --> 48:28.473
<i>Maybe if you love me</i>

48:28.531 --> 48:33.076
<i>You'll give me another chance</i>

48:33.077 --> 48:35.578
<i>Chance, I</i>

48:35.579 --> 48:38.498
<i>'Cause I still care</i>

48:38.499 --> 48:43.905
<i>I still care for you</i>

48:51.804 --> 48:54.127
Sorry. We won't... Sorry.

48:54.265 --> 48:55.837
Did you get all that?

48:55.975 --> 48:59.299
Billy Dixon and the Topix.
"Trance." Take three.

48:59.895 --> 49:03.898
<i>Late last night
Strolling down the street</i>

49:03.899 --> 49:05.400
<i>I saw a ghost that...</i>

49:06.986 --> 49:08.278
Stop the tape.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.697
You guys are not
hearing it like I do.

49:10.698 --> 49:13.199
I'm sorry, Crewe. How do you hear it?

49:13.200 --> 49:16.319
I'm hearing it in sky blue.
You're giving me brown.

49:17.329 --> 49:20.373
- Maybe that's because you're paying us shit.
- Excuse me?

49:20.374 --> 49:23.376
I'm sorry. Famous ears clogged up?
I'll say it into the mike.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.545
Maybe because you're
paying us fucking shit.

49:25.546 --> 49:27.547
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah.

49:27.548 --> 49:29.746
Let's see what the
goddamn problem is.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.461
We got his attention.
He's coming down.

49:32.970 --> 49:34.512
It's about fucking time.

49:34.513 --> 49:37.265
Are our sessions cutting
into your time at the track?

49:37.266 --> 49:39.851
- Let me tell you the problem.
- Here's the problem:

49:39.852 --> 49:43.521
You said you'd record us. That was a
year ago. When are you gonna record us?

49:43.522 --> 49:45.523
- Give me a hit.
- I've given you 10 hits.

49:45.524 --> 49:47.275
They're all derivative.

49:47.276 --> 49:51.196
Find yourselves a name and a sound and
then maybe we can make something happen.

49:51.197 --> 49:53.948
How do you know what's a hit
until you get it out there?

49:53.949 --> 49:57.827
Okay. You want me to produce
four songs? Get me the money.

49:57.828 --> 50:00.079
- What are you talking about?
- I am tapped out.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.373
You want a session,
it's gonna cost you $3500.

50:02.374 --> 50:04.292
Eight rooms on Park Avenue,
he's tapped out.

50:04.293 --> 50:07.378
Ten, Sam Spade. And I've got
certain personal obligations.

50:07.379 --> 50:09.497
Yeah. No, I saw him.

50:09.882 --> 50:12.535
Don't get me started, baby.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.458
Perfect.

50:16.263 --> 50:17.847
Could use a little more color.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.849
Thanks a lot.
Pleasure working with you.

50:19.850 --> 50:22.268
Yeah, maybe powder blue.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.770
Royal blue.

50:23.771 --> 50:25.218
Bullshit.

50:25.564 --> 50:28.183
Crewe's right about one thing.
Your songs are derivative.

50:29.109 --> 50:30.318
Really?

50:30.319 --> 50:32.362
You don't think I know
what that means?

50:32.363 --> 50:34.364
It means they all sound
like each other.

50:34.365 --> 50:37.769
Lay off. Let Bob write the songs,
you make the bookings, okay?

50:38.118 --> 50:41.120
Okay, okay, okay.
I talked to the manager.

50:41.121 --> 50:43.915
You do two sets.
It's a cool $350 a night.

50:43.916 --> 50:45.750
Ten nights, you got your session.

50:45.751 --> 50:48.654
- And I'm only gonna take 5 percent.
- What?

50:48.879 --> 50:51.247
Or not. Joking.

50:53.384 --> 50:55.593
- How about it?
- Okay, let's do it.

50:55.594 --> 50:57.220
- Good.
- Uh...

50:57.221 --> 50:58.429
Okay.

50:58.430 --> 50:59.956
It's good.

51:06.897 --> 51:08.799
Wait, wait, wait.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.817
What's your name?

51:10.818 --> 51:12.470
- The Romans.
- The Topix.

51:12.528 --> 51:13.975
- The Varietones.
- The Topix.

51:13.988 --> 51:15.822
- The Four Lovers.
- No, no, no.

51:15.823 --> 51:17.574
You. I know you.

51:17.575 --> 51:20.410
You used to come in here.
You had some kind of scam going.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.579
Spotting pins and
betting on the games.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.373
- I never been here before.
- I never forget a face.

51:25.374 --> 51:28.209
Get out. All of you.
Come on, let's go.

51:28.210 --> 51:30.837
Come on, before Jesus gets back.
Let's go. Move.

51:30.838 --> 51:32.630
You have a memory like an elephant.

51:32.631 --> 51:34.783
I don't need a band, I got a jukebox.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.801
Someday we'll be on
that fucking jukebox.

51:36.802 --> 51:39.053
I'm not gonna hire you,
I got no slots left.

51:39.054 --> 51:41.877
The Four Lovers.
You look like the Four Felons.

51:42.308 --> 51:44.051
That went well.

51:44.852 --> 51:46.686
Hey, Joey, you're a real prick.

51:46.687 --> 51:48.980
This is crazy. We gotta find a club.

51:48.981 --> 51:51.524
Forget the clubs. What we
want is a record contract.

51:51.525 --> 51:54.519
What contract? We can't even
book a lousy bowling alley.

51:54.695 --> 51:57.196
Maybe this is a good time
to start my own group.

51:57.197 --> 52:00.491
You're not starting any groups.
You're in this group, Nicky.

52:00.492 --> 52:03.536
Yeah, which one? The Topix?
The Romans? The Lovers?

52:03.537 --> 52:05.330
Who we gonna be next, Tommy?

52:10.294 --> 52:12.162
Frankie.

52:13.505 --> 52:14.952
What?

52:17.051 --> 52:19.249
It's a sign, Tommy.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.622
Ooh.

52:22.181 --> 52:24.333
I still like the Four Felons.

52:24.683 --> 52:27.006
Yeah, but we still need the $3500.

52:27.811 --> 52:31.814
Don't worry about it, all right?
I'll take care of it. That's what I do.

52:31.815 --> 52:33.842
Now just write us a goddamn hit.

52:34.902 --> 52:36.599
Put that in the trunk.

52:37.363 --> 52:41.449
<i>So I lock myself in my room and I
write four new songs in two days.</i>

52:41.450 --> 52:43.693
<i>No, not songs.</i>

52:44.203 --> 52:45.650
<i>Hits.</i>

52:46.372 --> 52:47.789
Norman.

52:47.790 --> 52:49.316
What's up?

52:51.210 --> 52:52.782
You're late.

52:53.671 --> 52:55.421
I couldn't find parking for my canoe.

52:55.422 --> 52:57.824
Heh. Five thousand.

52:58.384 --> 52:59.910
Let's see.

53:01.220 --> 53:04.248
The 11 grand you owe me,
plus this five...

53:05.349 --> 53:07.642
It's getting heavy.
You're up to 16 grand.

53:07.643 --> 53:09.811
Don't worry. We just
signed with RCA Victor.

53:09.812 --> 53:11.020
That's good.

53:11.021 --> 53:14.857
- You don't wanna get behind on the vig.
- I don't wanna get behind on anything.

53:14.858 --> 53:16.067
I'll send you a record.

53:16.068 --> 53:18.641
Better yet, send me three
grand by next Friday.

53:19.822 --> 53:21.030
Three grand?

53:21.031 --> 53:24.059
- I thought it was like a thousand.
- Three grand.

53:27.371 --> 53:29.831
<i>- So you like the new name?</i>
- I love the new name.

53:29.832 --> 53:31.666
- All right.
- And so did Vivaldi.

53:31.667 --> 53:33.126
What? Who?

53:33.127 --> 53:37.171
- Some guy stole our name? I'll go talk to him.
- It's okay, Tommy. He's already dead.

53:37.172 --> 53:38.756
What about the songs?

53:38.757 --> 53:41.676
The songs? I love the songs.
The songs are great.

53:41.677 --> 53:44.262
- But we still have a problem.
- What?

53:44.263 --> 53:45.835
The <i>scarols?</i>

53:46.014 --> 53:47.348
Here.

53:47.349 --> 53:48.966
It's 3500.

53:49.393 --> 53:51.060
DeVito delivers.

53:51.061 --> 53:52.678
Fuck Vivaldi.

53:53.981 --> 53:55.507
I'll drink to that.

54:04.533 --> 54:06.526
Let me see. "Sherry."

54:09.163 --> 54:10.610
Oh, shit!

54:10.873 --> 54:12.248
Stop!

54:12.249 --> 54:14.000
This is bullshit, Frankie.

54:14.001 --> 54:16.335
Most important day of
his life and he's late.

54:16.336 --> 54:19.213
- It's not like Bobby to be late.
- That's Tommy's territory.

54:19.214 --> 54:21.174
All right, <i>stronzo</i>, get off my case.

54:21.175 --> 54:23.342
Lay off the booze while you're at it.

54:23.343 --> 54:26.337
Hey, watch your mouth in my house.

54:26.638 --> 54:29.974
Francine. Francine. Come here, baby.

54:29.975 --> 54:31.684
All right, go with your mommy.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.227
- Beautiful.
- She wasn't listening.

54:33.228 --> 54:34.854
- That way.
- She was drawing.

54:34.855 --> 54:36.063
Shut up.

54:36.064 --> 54:38.307
- Pretty pictures, Francine.
- Come on.

54:38.942 --> 54:40.151
Leave that.

54:40.152 --> 54:41.611
- Come on.
- Asshole.

54:41.612 --> 54:44.106
Oh, real nice. Real nice.

54:44.281 --> 54:45.978
Hypocrite.

54:48.327 --> 54:51.913
- Hey. Here's the song.
- What is this? Are you kidding me?

54:51.914 --> 54:54.457
He comes in with a piece of
paper he wrote 15 minutes ago.

54:54.458 --> 54:56.155
Gimme.

54:57.044 --> 55:00.379
- This looks good.
- No, it's an insult. It's a slap in the face.

55:00.380 --> 55:02.507
Don't take it personal.
It looks good.

55:02.508 --> 55:04.717
- I'm on the hook.
- We do the four we rehearsed.

55:04.718 --> 55:07.261
We're not taking votes here,
all right? I run the group.

55:07.262 --> 55:10.139
We don't have enough time.
Crewe's got the ears. Let him decide.

55:10.140 --> 55:14.010
Crewe's gonna tell you the same thing.
You put me in a real pinch, Frankie.

55:14.061 --> 55:16.312
You got another song?
Come on, let's try it.

55:16.313 --> 55:19.482
- I don't now.
- Let me see. All right. I'll take the bottom-.

55:21.068 --> 55:22.401
Bob Crewe.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.278
- Middle?
- Hey, uh, Crewe.

55:24.279 --> 55:27.490
I'm sorry we're late. Listen,
we got something for you, all right?

55:27.491 --> 55:29.659
<i>- Right now?</i>
- No, just listen. Just listen.

55:29.660 --> 55:30.868
Here we go.

55:30.869 --> 55:33.079
One, two, three, four...

55:33.080 --> 55:35.998
<i>Sherry</i>

55:35.999 --> 55:39.418
<i>Sherry baby
Sherry</i>

55:39.419 --> 55:41.712
<i>Sherry baby</i>

55:41.713 --> 55:44.090
- Set up the eight-track.
- What for?

55:44.091 --> 55:47.051
We're gonna double Frankie's voice.
It's gonna explode off the radio.

55:47.052 --> 55:51.173
- I never heard of that before.
- Because it's never been done before. Heh.

55:51.223 --> 55:53.349
I'm a fucking genius.

55:53.350 --> 55:56.310
- What does he think?
- That's good, right? Right, Crewe?

55:56.311 --> 55:58.759
- Get over here now.
- We'll be right over.

55:59.731 --> 56:04.402
You're listening to me,
Barry Belson, WCFA Radio.

56:04.403 --> 56:06.571
We're in our 17th hour...

56:06.572 --> 56:09.907
locked inside the studio, and yes...

56:09.908 --> 56:12.869
we're still playing the same song.

56:12.870 --> 56:15.580
I mean, is that a
different sound, or what?

56:15.581 --> 56:16.873
Who are these people?

56:16.874 --> 56:19.208
Four black guys?
Three guys and a girl?

56:19.209 --> 56:22.783
What can I say?
I love this record! Ha-ha-ha.

56:22.838 --> 56:25.965
Whoo! We're gonna see this go
right to the top, my friends.

56:25.966 --> 56:30.636
<i>And we're gonna see it happen this
Saturday on American Bandstand.</i>

56:30.637 --> 56:33.639
<i>Oh, what the hey,
I'm gonna play it again.</i>

56:33.640 --> 56:38.811
<i>So put down that girl and lend
an ear to The Four Seasons!</i>

56:41.690 --> 56:43.316

56:43.317 --> 56:44.901

Come out tonight</i>

<i>Sherry, can you come out tonight?</i>

57:16.183 --> 57:18.684
<i>Why don't you come out?</i>

57:18.685 --> 57:21.103
<i>- Come out
- To my twist party</i>

57:21.104 --> 57:22.480
<i>Come out</i>

57:45.629 --> 57:47.797
<i>Why don't you come out?</i>

57:47.798 --> 57:50.075
<i>- Come out
- With your red dress on</i>

57:50.258 --> 57:51.425
<i>Come out</i>

57:51.426 --> 57:53.970
<i>Mm, you look so fine</i>

<i>Come</i>

58:51.611 --> 58:54.363
- Hey. What's going on? You got the song?
- Hey.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.437
No. Not yet, not yet.

58:57.284 --> 59:00.411
What've you been doing? It's three weeks.
The company's going nuts.

59:00.412 --> 59:02.955
- So, what's in the bag?
- Chinese. Gotta eat to work.

59:02.956 --> 59:05.541
Oh, my gosh. Shush, shush.
Bobby, Bobby. Come here, come here.

59:05.542 --> 59:07.084

Come on. What are you doing?
Working or watching the tube?

59:13.258 --> 59:14.508
- Shh. Come on.
- Get forks.

59:14.509 --> 59:15.801
"I feel like smiling."

59:15.802 --> 59:17.219
<i>I feel like smiling.</i>

59:17.220 --> 59:19.588
<i>You heard me. Get it off.</i>

59:20.307 --> 59:21.974
- "Make me."
- That's right.

59:21.975 --> 59:23.350
Watch this.

59:23.351 --> 59:24.560
<i>Make me.</i>

Oh, he will.

Oh.

<i>Said goodbye</i>

59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.054
<i>My, oh, my</i>

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:04.183
<i>My girl didn't cry</i>

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:06.352
<i>I wonder why</i>

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.853
<i>Silly boy</i>

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.939
<i>Told my girl we had to break up</i>

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.565
<i>Silly boy</i>

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:13.651
<i>Hoped that she would call my bluff</i>

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:15.027
<i>Silly boy</i>

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:18.239
<i>Then she said to my surprise</i>

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.867
<i>Big girls don't cry</i>

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:24.620
<i>Maybe</i>

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:27.206
<i>I was cruel</i>

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:28.608
<i>I was cruel</i>

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:33.254
<i>Baby, I'm a fool</i>

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:35.464
<i>I'm such a fool</i>

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.924
<i>Silly girl</i>

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:38.384
<i>"Shame on you"</i>

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.511
<i>- Your mama said
- Silly girl</i>

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.680
<i>Shame on you
You cried in bed</i>

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:45.209
<i>- Silly girl
- Shame on you</i>

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:47.351
<i>You told a lie</i>

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:51.021
<i>Big girls do cry</i>

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:53.774
<i>Big girls</i>

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:56.485
<i>Don't cry</i>

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.696
<i>They don't cry</i>

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:02.366
<i>Big girls don't cry</i>

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:05.870
<i>That's just an alibi</i>

01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:09.206
<i>Big girls don't cry</i>

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:12.710
<i>Big girls don't cry</i>

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:17.036
<i>Big girls don't cry</i>

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:27.433
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
We're the Four Seasons.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.351
Thank you. Thank you.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:32.062
On bass guitar,
we have Mr. Nick Massi.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.884
Keyboard, we have Bob Gaudio.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.061
I'm Tommy DeVito.

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:40.613
And this is Mr. Frankie Valli.

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:46.861
Thank you very much. You've been
a wonderful crowd. Thank you.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:50.331
- It's just, I don't get it.
- What don't you get, Tommy?

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:53.083
- The title, "Walk Like a Man."
- So?

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:55.452
As opposed to what, a woman?

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:58.297
No, it's for boys, Tommy.
Teenage boys.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:00.132
We're telling them to act like men.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:01.842
Instead of like girls.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:04.261
Yeah, instead of like...
No! Instead of like boys.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:06.722
- Come on. Why're you doing this?
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:07.973
Miss Congeniality.

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.183
It's a metaphor.

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:13.437
It's an anthem for every guy who's ever
been twisted around a girl's little finger.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.773
If I'm explaining that to
you, we're in trouble.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:17.983
Now knock off the bullshit
and sing the song.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:20.136
Roll the tape, Phil.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.934
"Walk Like a Man."

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.606
Take one.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:51.043
Merry Christmas. Come on in.

01:02:56.982 --> 01:02:59.233
Look. They're organized
the way he likes them.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:00.567
What's your name?

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:02.695
- Steven.
- Steven?

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:04.405
<i>Said give her up, don't bother</i>

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:06.490
<i>The world isn't coming to an end</i>

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:07.700
<i>He said</i>

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:08.867
<i>Walk like a man</i>

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:10.160
- Nicky.
- Yeah, what?

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.204
How much is he Gaudio?

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:16.125
- Hey, who invited the brother along?
- It's the little brother. Baby Gaudio.

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:20.421
Come on. Take off the jacket.
You look like you're working.

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:21.914
What's the matter?

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.512
Loosen up that bow tie.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:32.087
Where's Bobby? Bobby's gotta
see this face. Look at this face.

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:35.227
I'll say this about Tommy.

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:38.605
He had his issues, but he
sure knew how to run a party.

01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:40.482
<i>Fast as I can</i>

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:43.306
<i>Walk like a man from you</i>

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:52.411
I bring the boy to the party.
Now I bring the party to the boy.

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:54.189
Oh, hello.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:56.832
Enjoy yourselves.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.280
We will.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:14.713
Uh...

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:18.270
Hi, I'm Bob.

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:21.265
Shh. I'm your Christmas present.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:38.582
Yes! Well done!

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:41.210
- Well done!
- All right. Congratulations.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:42.828
You were right.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.297
It is more fun with another person.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.221
- Yeah, hello.
- Frankie.

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:54.973
Come on. Come here.
We're still going. Jump in your car.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.796
You'll be here in 10 minutes.

01:04:57.519 --> 01:04:59.061
I got a present for you.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.480
You know, Tommy. We just
got back from church.

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:04.100
You don't even understand, Frankie.

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.318
You are missing all the fun.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:10.644
No, I think I got as much fun as
I can handle here. Right, Toni?

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.351
All right. Bye.

01:05:15.453 --> 01:05:20.582
<i>Like a man</i>

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:24.294
<i>Like a</i>

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:28.325
<i>Man</i>

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:51.363
Did I not say the stars
were in alignment?

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.073
Three number ones in a row.

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:56.076
- You are always right, Crewe.
- There's that.

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:59.121
- Where's Tommy and Nicky? Get them.
- Hey, come on in here.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.707
Over here. He's got golden
ears, he's blind as a bat.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:04.209
- Come on! Three number ones!
- Right?

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.879
- That's what I'm saying.
- Who's the best fucking team?

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.748
- All right.
- Come on, Frankie. Aah.

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.675
Well, maybe we should
make an investment.

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:14.178
- In what? In art?
- Mm-mm. In us.

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:15.796
What do you mean?

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.599
Well, you got the voice.
I got the songs.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.975
Yeah, so?

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:24.771
So we make a partnership. I give
you half of everything I write...

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:28.025
and you give me half of everything
you record outside the group.

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:30.428
Why would I ever record
outside the group?

01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:33.560
I don't know. Things happen.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.949
What about Tommy and Nick?

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.951
Nicky's really the
one got me singing.

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:40.120
Tommy, we wouldn't be here
if it weren't for him.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:43.582
- It won't cut into their share. I'd never do that.
- We gotta tell them.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.235
Yeah, of course.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.781
If things work out,
think we could talk about a sax?

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:54.418
If things work out, we can talk
about a whole horn section.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.295
Okay, I'm in.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.711
All right.

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:02.601
I'll have somebody
draw up a contract.

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:05.479
What, you mean like sign a
piece of paper from a lawyer?

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.523
- Yeah.
- You wanna do this thing?

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:09.691
- But we gotta get something on paper.
- So we do it.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:10.943
You want a contract?

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.391
Here.

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:15.143
A Jersey contract.

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:27.000
<i>He went away and you hung around</i>

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:29.278
<i>And bothered me every night</i>

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.506
<i>And when I wouldn't go outwith you</i>

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:36.593
<i>You said things that
weren't very nice</i>

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:39.930
<i>My boyfriend's back
And you're gonna be in trouble</i>

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.683
<i>Hey-la, hey-la</i>

01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:44.643
<i>- My boyfriend's back
- You see him comin'</i>

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:46.520
<i>Better cut out on the double</i>

01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:49.898
<i>Hey-la, hey-la
My boyfriend's back</i>

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.985
<i>You been spreading
lies that I was untrue</i>

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:56.071
<i>Hey-la, hey-la
My boyfriend's back</i>

01:07:56.072 --> 01:08:00.200
<i>So look out now 'cause he's comin' after you</i>

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:01.368
<i>Hey-la, hey-la</i>

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:03.662
I like the one on the right. Yeah.

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.122
No, no. No dibs.

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:07.446
- What?
- Share and share alike.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:19.136
Hey, Tommy, you put that 10
grand back in the tax account?

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:22.086
Come on, Nicky.
Get off my back, all right?

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:26.810
Well, it's adding up. Plus the 3500 you
dropped at the track last Saturday...

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:28.645
What are you, a ledger? Huh?

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:31.064
Forget it. From now on
there's a new arrangement.

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.483
Frankie rides with me.
You ride with the genius.

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:36.694
- That's kind of up to Frankie, isn't it?
- Stick to what you know.

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:37.904
Come on.

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:41.450
Isn't it up to Bobby too? I mean,
the two of them are always together.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:42.826
They're like a pair of...

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.411
um, what do you call them...

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:46.029
Chinese twins.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:51.819
Try not to say anything the rest
of the day. All right, sweetheart?

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:00.886
Everybody has a girlfriend,
honey. Everybody.

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:04.014
I don't understand. Why did you
get married in the first place?

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:08.310
- Are you kidding? Family is everything.
- Oh.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.145
Well, that makes sense.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:13.231
- Here we go. All right.
- This looks like the place.

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:15.760
- Okay, Bobby, I'll call you.
- Yep.

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:19.571
- Get your stuff?
- I got it.

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:21.599
- Have a good one.
- Take it easy.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:31.832
You show up for a couple of days
and think that makes you a father?

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.627
At least when I'm here,
I'm here. I'm not stoned.

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:37.964
- Think the kids don't know?
- You wanna switch places? Anytime!

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:41.259
- There's the kitchen and washing!
- Go. We'll live off what you make!

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.679
No, thanks. I wouldn't
wanna cramp your style.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.555
The road is the road.
I'm there to provide for this family.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:49.393
- Certain things are none of your business!
- Your family's out there!

01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:51.395
You think I don't know what goes on?

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:53.563
Here. Unh!

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:55.691
Give it to one of your
"special friends."

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:58.944
Go tour outer space.
You'll still be what you always were:

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:03.441
A dumb wop from Jersey who never
even graduated high school.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.194
Mr. Vally with a "Y."

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.772
Give me a fucking break.

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:12.115
Pick that up.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.152
Pick that up.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.392
Is Mommy very sick?

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:41.179
What do you mean?

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.949
Well, sometimes she drinks a lot of medicine
and then goes to sleep on the couch.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.576
Medicine, huh?

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.445
Hmm.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:52.948
Well, you know, Francine...

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:58.113
sometimes that medicine
makes Mommy really tired.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:01.741
Daddy, do you love me?

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.760
Of course I love you.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.834
But do you like me?

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:09.165
Do I like you?

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:14.144
Are you crazy? Yes, I like you.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:17.230
I like you more than the stars
and the moon and the sun...

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:20.384
and everything all thrown
in together, okay?

01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:23.195
Will you go to sleep now?

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:24.893
Sing me.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.648
<i>My eyes adored you</i>

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:36.068
<i>Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you</i>

01:11:36.918 --> 01:11:42.165
<i>Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you</i>

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.501
<i>So close</i>

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:49.835
<i>So close and yet so far</i>

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.419
Here.

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:53.922
Like this.

01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:55.727
- You cozy?
- Mm-hm.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:57.187
Okay?

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:58.635
Good.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.030
- Be good. Okay?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.074
Come on.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:28.793
Thanks, Francine.

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:20.395
It's a puppet who's a mouse with
an accent. I don't get it either.

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:23.148
You are not playing to the house.
You're playing to the camera.

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:25.609
Don't move around too much.
And don't look down.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:28.763
And smile. Hey, it's <i>Ed Sullivan</i>,
not a funeral.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:30.447
One minute.

01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:32.115
Hey, Frankie!

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:35.952
You guys are fabulous. You guys just
keep getting better and better.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:38.038
- Thanks.
- Is Tommy around?

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:39.456
Who wants to know?

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:41.985
Norman Waxman, Frankie.
A friend of Tommy's.

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:45.242
- Listen. What's this about?
- Money.

01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:49.090
- Listen, Mr....
- Waxman.

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.425
Norman Waxman.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.136
You got business, talk to
our attorney. Excuse me...

01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:55.972
No, no, no. You got a
little success now, right?

01:13:55.973 --> 01:13:59.309
You got the records, the TV,
the personal appearances.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:00.810
We're all very proud of you.

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:02.354
Excuse me. You can't be here.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:04.598
Tommy's put me in
this awkward position.

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:08.985
I've stalled my people as long
as I can, but he's in too deep.

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:11.279
They want their money. Now.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.150
Before something unfortunate happens
and it all goes up in smoke.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:16.910
This is bullshit.

01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:18.578
How much does Tommy owe you?

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:20.997
- 150 large.
- Excuse me?

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:24.402
- One hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
- Jesus.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:28.372
Hey. Did you think I
wasn't gonna make it?

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.578
Hey, Normie.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.961
- What's up?
- Hey, Tommy,

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:35.553
You're on.

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.171
The guy said we had 5.

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:39.212
Well, we're on now.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:50.485
<i>For all of the youngsters in
the country, The Four Seasons.</i>

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.696
<i>So let's have a pleasant
intro for them.</i>

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:18.304
<i>I'll be working my way
back to you, babe</i>

01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:21.850
<i>With a burning love inside</i>

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:25.596
<i>Hey, I'm working my
way back to you, babe</i>

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:28.940
<i>And the happiness that died</i>

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:32.652
<i>I let it get away</i>

01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:34.446
<i>Been paying every day</i>

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.076
Bob will tell you it
was smooth sailing...

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:44.732
right up until we hit the iceberg
with Tommy and the $150,000.

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:47.042
That's Bob.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:49.419
He was always looking so
far into the future...

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.699
he never saw what was
going on under his nose.

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:56.843
Fact is, the trouble didn't
start at the Sullivan Show.

01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:59.137
It started long before that.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:02.307
<i>Oh, for every day
I made you cry</i>

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:12.859
<i>Ooh, Dawn, go away back where you belong</i>

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.737
<i>Girl, we can't</i>

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:18.448
<i>Change the places where we were born</i>

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:21.493
<i>Before you say</i>

01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:22.911
<i>You say</i>

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:25.064
<i>That you want me</i>

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.612
<i>I want you to think</i>

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:30.376
<i>- Think, think
- What your family would say</i>

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:33.505
<i>- Think, think
- Think what you're throwing away</i>

01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:37.383
<i>Now think what the future would be
With a poor boy</i>

01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:40.762
<i>Like me</i>

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:43.723
<i>Me</i>

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:46.017
<i>Dawn</i>

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:49.771
<i>Go away, I'm no good for you</i>

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:55.902
Dawn, go away

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:02.064
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll see you again next year.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.644
Wonderful time.

01:17:04.411 --> 01:17:06.538
- Great show, fellas!
- Thank you!

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:08.456
- Welcome to Cleveland!
- Thank you!

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:10.279
You're under arrest.

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:12.877
- What?
- For what?

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:15.922
- Defrauding an innkeeper.
- What?

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:17.632
You fellas played here last year?

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:19.080
Yeah.

01:17:19.343 --> 01:17:20.995
You stay at a Holiday Inn?

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:23.721
- I don't remember.
- Well, they do.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:25.557
You skipped without paying the bill.

01:17:25.558 --> 01:17:27.892
- You owe $120.
- For crying out loud...

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:30.478
A minor oversight. I can
take care of that right now.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.381
Take that up with the judge.

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:35.847
Come on, officer, can't we
deal with this privately?

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:38.937
You wouldn't be offering
a bribe, would you?

01:17:41.949 --> 01:17:44.659
All right, all right. My friend,
my friend, my friend.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.233
Every man is looking for a queen.
Where is she?

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.250
Oh, with another man.

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:56.129
What're you gonna do? It happens.
We're all winners here. That's 40 you owe me.

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:59.174
Hey, Nicky, you remember when
we couldn't get arrested?

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:01.467
When was that? When you were 3?

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:03.428
All right. Calm down, genius, huh?

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:06.598
It's not the end of the world.
We'll be out in a couple of days.

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:10.128
This may come as a shock to you,
but I don't have a police record.

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:13.396
Oh, no? Well, it's never
too late to start, right?

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:16.774
Hey, who knows, maybe you guys
come up with a hit song out of it.

01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:18.276
Right, Frankie, huh?

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:20.805
<i>Oh, me, oh, my-o</i>

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:22.447
Come on, Frankie.

01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:26.284
<i>Did some time in old Ohio</i>

01:18:26.285 --> 01:18:27.785
Tommy, can it.

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:30.788
Come on. Calm your friend down.
He's about to shit his pants.

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:34.159
I'm not gonna calm down.
I'm in a jail cell with a...

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:37.462
--person.

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.253
Hello.

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:48.598
Over here.

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:50.046
Hey, hi.

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:52.018
Thank you very much.

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:53.478
You have a very nice jail.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.688
Bob never forgave Tommy
for that weekend.

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:58.608
Me, I let it slide because
the group comes first.

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:00.886
We're all in this together, right?

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:03.238
Here, beautiful.

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:04.686
Right.

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:07.575
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.577
- Of course, of course.
- We love Ohio.

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.625
We shouldn't be drawing
on this account.

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:17.752
We gotta set something
aside for Uncle Sam.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.797
Lou, this is November.
April's what, nine months away?

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:24.342
- Six, actually.
- And that's why you're the accountant.

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:26.511
Yes. And that's why
I think it's important...

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:28.346
Don't think. I'm the client.

01:19:28.347 --> 01:19:30.640
Twenty thousand,
Bellevue Apartments, I.N.C.

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:31.849
What's "GAVA"?

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:33.851
- It's a fruit, like your brother.
- Hey.

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:35.895
Bobby and Frankie's partnership.

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:38.648
- What partnership?
- Some kind of cockamamie partnership.

01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:39.899
About what?

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:42.694
Frankie sings, Bobby writes,
some kind of split.

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:44.988
- And you knew about this?
- Yeah, so?

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:46.614
So when were you gonna tell me?

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:49.826
All right. Don't make a <i>braciola</i>, uh?
Doesn't cut into your share.

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:53.204
I don't know. A group is a group.
It's not two guys with a side deal.

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:54.580
And I agree with you.

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:57.450
You think it's gonna work
with those two egos?

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.544
I think I should start my own group.

01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:01.879
- You're not starting anything.
- Why not?

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.424
You gotta wake up before
noon to start your own.

01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:06.293
Lou, you're a gentleman.

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:12.140
So I let that slide too.

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:16.394
I mean, we were doing good.
Concerts, club dates, cover of Cashbox.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:20.273
Six more weeks at number one,
that covered a lot of sins.

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:21.941
Until we hit Detroit.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:25.445
<i>This reporter comes to do a feature
on us, and Frankie falls hard.</i>

01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:29.771
So tell me a little bit about
where you grew up.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.620
I'm from Belleville, New Jersey.
Right outside of Newark.

01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:36.147
Mm-hm.

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:38.446
Here, look.

01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:43.990
I got some pictures here.

01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:46.499
That's my mother.

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:50.162
Best meatball sandwiches
in all of America.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.221
Five-foot-two,
but don't mess with her.

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:56.642
She really wanted me out
of that neighborhood.

01:20:56.643 --> 01:21:01.147
Course, she's still right there in the
same projects but I can't get her out.

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:03.524
She doesn't wanna leave
her friends. I tell her:

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.818
"Take them with you,
I'll move them all." She says no.

01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:07.445
Send her cash, it goes in the drawer.

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:09.947
The washing machine breaks,
she won't spend money.

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:11.407
Goes to the laundromat.

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:14.285
Tells everybody she's
Frankie Valli's mother.

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:18.111
People think I'm the kind of son that
makes his mother go to a laundromat.

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.705
What else you wanna know?

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:32.804
Then she interviewed Tommy.

01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:34.222
Thing about Tommy is...

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:38.684
he was only used to dealing
with a certain class of woman...

01:21:38.685 --> 01:21:42.814
so when he went up against
Lorraine, it was like, no contest.

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:44.524
What did Frankie say about me?

01:21:44.525 --> 01:21:46.818
Not really much.
More about him and Bobby.

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:49.320
How the group never took
off till Bobby came along.

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:51.689
Did he tell you that I hired Bobby?

01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:54.651
He said it was more
like a group decision.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:58.272
- Oh, he said that, huh?
- Mm-hm.

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:03.611
Did he tell you that before I took him on
he was studying to be a hairdresser?

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:06.045
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:08.039
The kid was lost.

01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:09.632
Between you and me...

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:12.718
and don't print this because
he doesn't want it out there...

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:14.846
I taught him everything he knows.

01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:16.431
- Really?
- Everything.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:19.350
- Ah.
- But not everything I know.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.144
Aah.

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:23.813
I even had to get
him laid the first time.

01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:25.807
Give him a little tutoring.

01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:30.808
Well, you tutored him very well.

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:34.687
Why don't we cut to the
chase here, Lorraine.

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:37.315
How do you mean, Tommy?

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:41.068
Well, I can see you're a big girl.

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:47.378
Look, when you get tired
of high school...

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:50.548
you let me know when you wanna
check out the graduate course.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.097
Okay.

01:22:58.098 --> 01:22:59.307
He hit on you?

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.975
Only, like, with a sledgehammer.

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:03.019
That son of a bitch,
I'm gonna kill him.

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:05.062
- It was funny.
- It's not. You don't do that.

01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:07.148
- He's pathetic. Leave it alone.
- You don't do it!

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.066
Now I'm supposed to
go on stage with him?

01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:13.196
- Sing with him? Make jokes? What is he, crazy?
- He might be stupid. Ever think of that?

01:23:13.197 --> 01:23:16.324
Tommy's not stupid. He's evil.
Did he put his hands on you?

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:17.783
No, of course not.

01:23:17.784 --> 01:23:19.276
This is bad.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:24.070
- Fuck!
- Jesus. What is the matter with you?

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:37.045
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Pick a card, pick a card. No?

01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:40.515
Mr. Big Shot over here.

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:43.169
Hey, everybody, that's Frankie Valli.

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:45.436
<i>He's freezing me out.</i>

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:47.939
I mean, what did I
do so terrible, huh?

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:49.967
Take him off the street?

01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:51.776
Put him in the group?

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:53.694
Hustle with him all these years.

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:56.189
Take him in like this, Nicky.
Like this.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.532
Make him a star.

01:23:57.533 --> 01:24:01.608
And now he won't even look at me.
Like Tommy DeVito's a fucking stain.

01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:03.162
Gimme a break.

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:05.122
For what? For what, I ask you, huh?

01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:07.491
A piece of ass? For that?

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:09.570
Get the fuck out of here.

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:15.049
I mean, is there an ounce of
good that I did? One ounce?

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.872
Hand me that, will you?

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:21.298
There's no towels.
Hand me the fucking towel.

01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:32.892
Am I right, or am I right?

01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:43.857
I want Bobby to handle
cash from now on.

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:45.526
What?

01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:47.983
I want Bobby to handle the cash.

01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:52.366
All right, let me explain something.

01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:54.171
When I leave this group...

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:55.548
or they carry me out...

01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:58.327
Bob can handle whatever
you want Bob to handle.

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:01.804
While I'm in this group, he's not gonna
handle a dime. You understand?

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:04.299
Not a fucking dime.

01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:07.169
Get that through your fucking head.

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:14.309
- Maybe we should put it to a vote.
- What?

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:15.526
What was that?

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:18.521
- Maybe we should put it to a vote.
- A vote?

01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:27.496
All right. I see. I see.
Now we got a democracy.

01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:29.373
All right. Let's put it to a vote.

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:32.376
Should Bob handle the money,
yea or nay? Huh?

01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:34.575
- Huh?
- Hey, hey!

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:37.706
Well, that's my vote.

01:25:38.383 --> 01:25:40.035
Anybody else?

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:45.765
- Tommy...
- Let it go.

01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:47.213
What?

01:25:49.519 --> 01:25:52.138
Oh, looks like the nays have it.

01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:57.553
Tommy won that one, but it was
the beginning of the end.

01:25:57.611 --> 01:26:02.938
Something just snapped and after
that it was just a long slow slide.

01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:07.495
<i>Until Norm Waxman showed up
backstage at the</i> Sullivan Show...

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:09.239
<i>and blew the lid off...</i>

01:26:09.373 --> 01:26:12.652
<i>we had no idea how deep in he was.</i>

01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:16.712
<i>With a burning love inside</i>

01:26:16.713 --> 01:26:20.242
<i>Yeah, I'm workin' my
way back to you, babe</i>

01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:24.053
<i>And the happiness that died</i>

01:26:24.054 --> 01:26:27.173
<i>I let it get away</i>

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:32.061
<i>I let it get away</i>

01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:35.022
<i>I'll be workin' my way back to you</i>

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:49.745
You'd think after everything
that went down...

01:26:49.746 --> 01:26:52.373
Frankie would have cut
Tommy loose right then.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:53.999
If that's what you think...

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.118
you're not from Jersey.

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:04.161
Hey, Gyp.

01:27:04.678 --> 01:27:07.627
- Tommy's in a little trouble.
- How little?

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:12.719
Hundred and fifty thousand.

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:16.715
Oh. Why isn't he standing
here talking to me?

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:20.928
Because he can't sing
"My Mother's Eyes" like I can.

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:26.490
You take care of family,
Frankie. I like that.

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:27.983
Yeah.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.312
I'll see what I can do.

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:48.796
We're here to resolve a problem.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:51.307
We're all gentlemen.

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:53.267
We will act in a civilized manner.

01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:57.509
How much are we talking about?

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:02.234
As of noon today, including the vig:

01:28:02.235 --> 01:28:04.137
One hundred and sixty-two large.

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:06.769
What were you thinking, Tommy?

01:28:07.324 --> 01:28:09.818
I don't know, Gyp. It, uh...

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:13.120
It always felt like I was playing
catch-up. It just crept up.

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:15.569
I'm surprised he's
still walking around.

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:18.626
I'll be honest with you, Gyp.
We like their songs.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:20.878
Anybody else, he'd already
be in the hospital.

01:28:20.879 --> 01:28:23.923
Come on. Gimme a break, huh?
What are you gonna do, huh? You fuck.

01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:26.509
- Sic one of your goons on me?
- Man is trying to work with you.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:28.552
- Hey, whose side are you on?
- Mine.

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:30.095
- Of course you are.
- Asshole.

01:28:30.096 --> 01:28:32.097
- I'm an asshole? You asshole.
- From day one.

01:28:32.098 --> 01:28:33.307
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:34.517
Fuck you, Nicky.

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:38.639
Gentlemen, our friend Mr. Waxman
has a legitimate point.

01:28:39.564 --> 01:28:41.511
Excuse me. All due respect.

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:43.427
He opened it up.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:46.479
I'm gonna say something.

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:51.826
I've been rooming with this guy on
and off for, what is it, 10 years?

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:54.995
This was not a walk in the park.
This was a sentence.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.872
A 10-year sentence.

01:28:56.873 --> 01:28:59.458
The man is a personal nightmare.

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:02.378
He wears the same underwear
three days running.

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:06.215
He takes no pride in his appearance.
In the simple amenities of life.

01:29:06.216 --> 01:29:07.675
You wanna talk about towels?

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:08.884
This isn't the time...

01:29:08.885 --> 01:29:11.303
The man cannot be in a hotel
without using all the towels.

01:29:11.304 --> 01:29:13.764
I'm talking face towels,
bath towels...

01:29:13.765 --> 01:29:16.350
the bathmat, the little washcloths.

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:17.560
Like he's living alone.

01:29:17.561 --> 01:29:20.729
You need a towel, you know
where it is? In a pile on the floor.

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:23.858
I come back to the room one time
the man is pissing in the sink.

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:26.610
- I never pissed in the sink.
- Right in the fucking sink.

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:29.572
I say, "Tommy, what's wrong
with you? There's a toilet."

01:29:29.573 --> 01:29:31.198
He says, "This was closer."

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:34.694
This is what I'm dealing with.
The man is not properly socialized.

01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:38.038
Frankie doesn't have to
deal with it. Gaudio doesn't.

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:41.158
I've had to deal with it 10 years!

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:48.549
Okay, Nick. Thank you
for sharing that.

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:50.050
Now, Norm and me...

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:52.720
we're gonna take a little walk,
work things out.

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:55.670
I want you boys to put
your heads together.

01:29:55.807 --> 01:29:58.130
See what you can come up with.

01:29:58.184 --> 01:29:59.710
And, you.

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:01.270
Hey!

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:03.105
Stay out of my bathroom.

01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:05.053
Pff.

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:24.376
Maybe Gyp can talk
sense into this guy.

01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:26.029
Forget sense.

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:28.243
Forget sense.

01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:32.415
I got a couple of things.

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:34.511
I could work something out.

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:37.264
Pull a job? Roll a 7-Eleven,
like the old days.

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:39.884
Shut your trap, all right,
and drink your wine!

01:30:41.478 --> 01:30:43.880
DeCarlo's not running
this group, I am.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.565
I don't know what we're doing
here, begging for help.

01:30:46.566 --> 01:30:48.317
You make me look like an asshole.

01:30:48.318 --> 01:30:50.945
- You do that all by yourself.
- Can we talk about...?

01:30:50.946 --> 01:30:54.281
You know what'd be nice? Since I was
here before any of you? Respect.

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.659
For what? Getting 162 in the hole?

01:30:56.660 --> 01:31:00.746
You know something? At least I tried, huh?
You think it's easy running the group?

01:31:00.747 --> 01:31:04.166
Dealing with the club owners,
the managers, the record companies?

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.669
Everybody trying to fuck
you five ways from Sunday?

01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:10.415
You don't care how it gets done, Nicky.
I took care of it! Me!

01:31:11.883 --> 01:31:13.409
Sit down.

01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:19.583
Sit down.

01:31:20.016 --> 01:31:21.668
Sit down.

01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:26.438
All right.

01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:30.218
Let's get it all out, right?
Crucify me, right? Come on.

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:31.978
Right, Tommy.

01:31:32.529 --> 01:31:33.737
All right.

01:31:33.738 --> 01:31:36.436
You don't give a shit about
the group. Never have.

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:40.160
It's always been whatever it is you
got going on, and then the group.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.997
Never rehearse, drive Nicky to drink,
put Bob through the wringer.

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:45.833
Forget trying to mess with my head,
which you've done from day one.

01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:49.283
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Be quiet for once.

01:31:50.922 --> 01:31:53.450
You know what the
shame of it is, Tommy?

01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:57.374
You're not a bad musician if you
give a little time. But, nah.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:02.709
You're too busy shooting your mouth off or
buying apartments to keep your girlfriends in.

01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:04.551
But no more.

01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:06.386
All that bullshit is over.

01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:10.471
This is how you talk to your friends?

01:32:10.608 --> 01:32:12.601
Friends, right.

01:32:14.821 --> 01:32:16.973
Not one Christmas present.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.028
Not one Christmas card.

01:32:23.038 --> 01:32:25.831
Not one time we go for a meal
and you pick up the check.

01:32:25.832 --> 01:32:29.202
Not one time do you ask me how my
kids are doing, how I'm doing.

01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:33.911
God help me, Tommy, part of me
would really like to see you hurt.

01:32:35.759 --> 01:32:37.468
Hey! Hey! Don't! Come on! Tommy!

01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:40.262
You talk to me that way?

01:32:40.263 --> 01:32:42.097
Come on! Get off him, get off!

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:44.091
Schoolkids!

01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:46.468
Leave that outside.

01:32:51.858 --> 01:32:53.150
All right?

01:32:53.151 --> 01:32:54.860
Here's how it's gonna go down.

01:32:54.861 --> 01:32:57.639
Excuse me, Mr. DeCarlo. The group...

01:32:58.073 --> 01:32:59.573
We've come to a decision.

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:01.100
We have?

01:33:03.703 --> 01:33:05.871
We're gonna pay back
every penny Tommy owes.

01:33:05.872 --> 01:33:07.899
- Wait a minute.
- Let me handle this.

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:10.542
It's a lousy few hundred grand.

01:33:10.543 --> 01:33:13.003
We got something, it took
a lot of work and years.

01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:14.588
- So?
- The group takes the debt.

01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:17.663
This is his problem.
Why do we take his debt?

01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:20.249
Because we're not gonna
let it come apart.

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:24.544
Is that good enough, Tommy?

01:33:24.974 --> 01:33:26.421
For what?

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:28.685
Frankie's singing was
never good enough.

01:33:28.686 --> 01:33:31.730
His ideas were never good enough.
Nothing was good enough.

01:33:31.731 --> 01:33:34.759
The kid who was never good
enough is bailing you out.

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:36.469
So is that good enough?

01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:39.681
It's a little more
complicated than that.

01:33:40.365 --> 01:33:41.812
Why?

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:43.992
My people are very angry.

01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:47.067
- They want a message sent.
- What message?

01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:51.250
You're moving to Las Vegas.

01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:52.459
What for?

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:55.337
Your health. We're gonna
keep an eye on you.

01:33:55.338 --> 01:33:57.881
We see you outside of
Nevada, it gets ugly.

01:33:57.882 --> 01:34:01.252
No way. No way. Not Nevada.
Better throw me in the river.

01:34:01.803 --> 01:34:03.250
Your choice.

01:34:03.263 --> 01:34:06.014
- Wait a minute. For how long?
- Till it's paid off.

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:09.226
- But we're in the middle of a tour.
- Best I could do.

01:34:09.227 --> 01:34:12.563
- But what happens to the group?
- I'll tell you what happens. Nothing.

01:34:12.564 --> 01:34:16.358
Why? Because it's still on paper that
I own 25 percent. So suck on that.

01:34:16.359 --> 01:34:19.486
I got a better idea.
A clean break. We buy him out.

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:23.141
What? No, no, no. You don't
buy me out. I buy you out.

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:25.397
With what, Tommy?

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:27.661
All right. Fine.

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:29.913
Buy me out. It's over anyway.

01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:32.658
How many more hits you
think you're gonna write?

01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:35.824
All right, wait a minute.

01:34:40.133 --> 01:34:42.126
Anything else we don't know about?

01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:48.883
I maybe borrowed a little
from the tax account.

01:34:50.727 --> 01:34:52.174
How much?

01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:54.438
Half a mil.

01:34:54.439 --> 01:34:56.887
- In that neighborhood.
- Oof.

01:35:03.448 --> 01:35:04.823
We're gonna take that too.

01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:07.443
- What are you...?
- I said let me handle it.

01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:15.864
The loan, the taxes...

01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:19.997
we take it all.

01:35:20.173 --> 01:35:21.790
All right.

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:24.877
That's it, then.

01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:27.755
Norm. Tommy.

01:35:28.765 --> 01:35:30.417
Excuse us.

01:35:38.608 --> 01:35:40.055
Hey, Frankie.

01:35:40.902 --> 01:35:42.349
Frankie.

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:44.976
It's that bad, huh?

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:52.279
Frankie...

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:56.367
you are digging a million-dollar
hole for yourself.

01:35:57.835 --> 01:36:01.364
Tommy took me off the streets, Gyp.
What's that worth?

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:03.958
You'll be on the road till you're 90.

01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:07.261
You want, I could arrange a loan.

01:36:07.262 --> 01:36:12.509
Thanks, Mr. DeCarlo, but I don't want anybody
involved in our future besides me and Frankie.

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:15.102
Hey, I just realized something.

01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:17.396
I don't wanna be in
this group anymore.

01:36:17.397 --> 01:36:19.982
- Not now, Nicky.
- No, forget that. I wanna go home.

01:36:19.983 --> 01:36:21.885
What are you talking about?

01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:23.694
I wanna go home.

01:36:23.695 --> 01:36:26.029
Good idea. After the tour,
we all take a break.

01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:27.447
No. Now.

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:28.895
I quit.

01:36:29.325 --> 01:36:30.993
You can't quit.

01:36:30.994 --> 01:36:33.370
I got his attention. Hi, Bob.

01:36:33.371 --> 01:36:35.914
Nicky, Nicky, we're in
the middle of a tour.

01:36:35.915 --> 01:36:38.292
Yeah. You know, I always
hated the touring.

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:41.295
Fucking hotels.
Those tiny little bars of soap.

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:43.880
You're supposed to wash with that?
Can't even see it.

01:36:43.881 --> 01:36:46.633
You're talking crazy.
Calm down and we'll figure it out.

01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:48.581
I already figured it out.

01:36:48.928 --> 01:36:50.470
I'll make it easy for you.

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:52.681
I don't want money.
I don't want side deals.

01:36:52.682 --> 01:36:54.016
All I want is out.

01:36:54.017 --> 01:36:55.559
You're right about the soap.

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.837
Hey, Nicky. Nicky.

01:36:58.438 --> 01:36:59.646
Nicky!

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:02.891
We're in the middle of a damn tour!
Are you crazy?

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:10.733
Nicky, wait.

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:12.351
Wait up.

01:37:13.536 --> 01:37:14.786
Let me understand.

01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:17.372
You put in all this time,
you have all these hits...

01:37:17.373 --> 01:37:19.416
and yet, you're gonna just walk away?

01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:21.114
That is crazy.

01:37:21.878 --> 01:37:25.589
Me and the wife had a little trouble
last year, so you know what I did?

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:27.758
I put the kids with my parents.

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:30.385
And then I told them, my own kids...

01:37:30.386 --> 01:37:34.461
I made up this thing where I told them
I was really their uncle. Uncle Nick.

01:37:34.557 --> 01:37:36.183
I don't understand.

01:37:36.184 --> 01:37:38.727
So I could screw around, you know.
Do what I wanted.

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:43.474
I figured if I wasn't home to put them to bed,
they wouldn't feel deprived of a father.

01:37:43.649 --> 01:37:45.767
I don't know what to say, Nick.

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:48.612
All due respect, Mr. DeCarlo...

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:52.187
you sell a hundred million records,
see how you handle it.

01:37:52.241 --> 01:37:55.360
Frankie and Bob,
they're gonna take this hard.

01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:57.287
I'm not worried.

01:37:57.288 --> 01:37:59.122
Those guys, with all their talent...

01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:01.275
they'll never even know I'm gone.

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:16.348
You want me to go out there
by myself? Are you nuts?

01:38:16.349 --> 01:38:19.226
Look, there's a lot of great
backup guys out there, right?

01:38:19.227 --> 01:38:21.895
There's Joe Long, Charlie Calello.

01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:24.469
We find two more
and put you in front.

01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:27.609
Get a great drummer. A horn
section like we talked about.

01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:29.694
Like Basie and the Kenton band.

01:38:29.695 --> 01:38:31.279
- What do you do?
- Write and produce.

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.447
I don't like it.

01:38:32.448 --> 01:38:34.074
- Why?
- You're crapping out on me.

01:38:34.075 --> 01:38:36.569
- I thought we had a handshake.
- We do.

01:38:37.078 --> 01:38:40.322
I wake up in the middle of the night,
I don't know where I am.

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:44.531
I think, "What the hell happened?
What's gonna happen? Everybody leaves."

01:38:47.213 --> 01:38:49.206
Why does everybody leave?

01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:51.450
Frankie.

01:38:54.053 --> 01:38:56.080
This is your time.

01:39:00.435 --> 01:39:02.018
How do you do that?

01:39:02.019 --> 01:39:03.466
What?

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:07.099
Get me to agree to stuff.

01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:09.302
It's a gift.

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:18.452
<i>You're only holdin' out your heart
In sympathy</i>

01:39:18.453 --> 01:39:20.579
<i>So while Bob's at
home with his family...</i>

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:24.374
<i>I'm on the road 200 nights a year,
doing anything I can dig up:</i>

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:28.154
<i>Night clubs, hotels,
private parties, anything.</i>

01:39:29.297 --> 01:39:32.757
<i>I'll be blue and I'll be cryin' too</i>

01:39:32.758 --> 01:39:35.886
<i>But, girl, you know
I only want what's best for you</i>

01:39:35.887 --> 01:39:37.914
<i>What good is all my pride</i>

01:40:34.529 --> 01:40:37.148
Yeah, you and me both, pal.

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:40.066
Mr. Valli.

01:40:40.826 --> 01:40:42.944
You got a collect call from Jersey.

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:53.296
- Where is she?
- You tell me. She's your daughter too.

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:55.674
She never knows if you'll visit,
it's always last minute.

01:40:55.675 --> 01:40:57.425
I'm an entertainer. Things get moved!

01:40:57.426 --> 01:40:59.219
- She needs a father!
- How about a mother?

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:00.971
Pull yourself together.

01:41:02.181 --> 01:41:04.333
Shit. Hello.

01:41:08.104 --> 01:41:09.551
Hello?

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:11.565
Can I talk to Mommy?

01:41:11.566 --> 01:41:12.899
Francine.

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:15.902
Where are you, sweetheart?
Your mother and I are worried sick.

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:18.071
I'm in the city, okay?
Don't have a cow.

01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:19.990
<i>Sweetheart, you can't disappear...</i>

01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:22.158
off the face of the earth.
Leave a note.

01:41:22.159 --> 01:41:24.160
<i>Don't yell at me, Daddy.</i>

01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:25.608
Look.

01:41:25.705 --> 01:41:28.699
I just took a plane halfway
across the country.

01:41:28.708 --> 01:41:30.292
You got money for a cab?

01:41:30.293 --> 01:41:32.536
<i>Just get in a cab and come home.</i>

01:41:33.296 --> 01:41:36.290
So now you're gonna be
a father all of a sudden?

01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:38.758
<i>It's two lousy days, Daddy.</i>

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.635
You disappear for months at a time.

01:41:40.636 --> 01:41:43.513
<i>- That's different, Francine.
- I know. You're working.</i>

01:41:43.514 --> 01:41:46.349
You're slaving away so you
can give us a good life.

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:48.977
I've heard it a billion times.
Give me a break.

01:41:48.978 --> 01:41:52.803
<i>- Can I talk to Mom?</i>
- Don't talk to me like that. I'm your father.

01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:57.140
Francine?

01:42:01.282 --> 01:42:02.899
Shit.

01:42:04.493 --> 01:42:07.271
Good job, Dad.

01:42:27.433 --> 01:42:29.517
- Francine?
- Yeah.

01:42:29.518 --> 01:42:33.092
- Your father, he'd like to see you.
- Oh, can I help you?

01:42:33.147 --> 01:42:35.140
No. Come on.

01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:38.097
Who the hell are you?

01:42:38.319 --> 01:42:40.528
Get lost before I snap your neck.

01:42:40.529 --> 01:42:42.806
It's okay. I'll call you.

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:05.291
Thanks, Johnny.

01:43:05.346 --> 01:43:07.089
Anytime, Frankie.

01:43:10.476 --> 01:43:12.298
Sit down, Francine.

01:43:18.401 --> 01:43:20.144
How'd you find me?

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:24.560
I got friends who have
friends on the street.

01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:27.142
You mean your friends in the Mob?

01:43:29.328 --> 01:43:30.829
You want something?

01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:32.277
Coke.

01:43:32.331 --> 01:43:34.449
- Can we get a Coke over here?
- Sure.

01:43:48.597 --> 01:43:50.544
Listen, Francine.

01:43:53.644 --> 01:43:55.717
I made some mistakes.

01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:59.892
I wasn't around enough.

01:44:00.276 --> 01:44:01.928
Your mother...

01:44:02.194 --> 01:44:04.312
We both know about her.

01:44:06.323 --> 01:44:08.475
I should have stepped in...

01:44:11.746 --> 01:44:14.289
but it's hard to balance
the home and the work.

01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:17.910
Maybe someday, you'll have a
family and you'll understand that.

01:44:18.502 --> 01:44:20.904
Hey. All right. Gimme that.

01:44:23.799 --> 01:44:26.952
You wanna be a singer,
first thing is you stop that.

01:44:28.763 --> 01:44:30.915
You could be a great singer.

01:44:32.391 --> 01:44:34.851
You got my chops, you got
your mother's beauty.

01:44:34.852 --> 01:44:36.728
You could have everything you want.

01:44:36.729 --> 01:44:39.097
But you gotta get it together.

01:44:39.899 --> 01:44:41.926
What's wrong with you?

01:44:42.318 --> 01:44:44.436
Running around like this?

01:44:45.362 --> 01:44:47.489
Look, I know how hard it is.

01:44:47.490 --> 01:44:51.520
You got something you wanna share
with the world and nobody gives a shit.

01:44:51.786 --> 01:44:53.995
But then things turn around.

01:44:53.996 --> 01:44:56.915
You have to have patience,
and you gotta keep working.

01:44:56.916 --> 01:44:59.068
We're gonna turn things around.

01:44:59.418 --> 01:45:00.865
All right?

01:45:01.712 --> 01:45:03.489
I'm gonna help you.

01:45:05.466 --> 01:45:08.085
I'm gonna get you in singing lessons.

01:45:08.844 --> 01:45:11.997
You're gonna start eating right,
gonna start exercising.

01:45:12.223 --> 01:45:15.642
I set it up with Bob Crewe, he's
gonna record you a demo. Four songs.

01:45:15.643 --> 01:45:17.260
All you.

01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:21.177
We're gonna get out
of this nightmare.

01:45:22.274 --> 01:45:24.017
You can do this.

01:45:25.486 --> 01:45:28.355
This is what you want, right? Right?

01:45:31.534 --> 01:45:33.106
Come here.

01:45:34.954 --> 01:45:36.480
I believe in you.

01:45:38.541 --> 01:45:40.568
I'm glad you're here with me.

01:45:45.881 --> 01:45:47.090
You know, it's funny...

01:45:47.091 --> 01:45:51.010
back in the day, we almost left Crewe
because he wouldn't record us a demo.

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:52.679
Four songs.

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:55.174
And now he's doing it for Francine.

01:45:57.017 --> 01:46:00.136
I swear, that kid,
she was going under.

01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:02.939
You know what it's like out
there with kids and drugs.

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.191
And her mother, you think
it's about the kid? No.

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:07.735
It's who's winning, who's wrong,
who's right, who screwed up.

01:46:07.736 --> 01:46:10.446
I mean, this woman...
People turn into something.

01:46:10.447 --> 01:46:12.699
- Frankie.
- What?

01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:14.317
I can't do this.

01:46:14.869 --> 01:46:16.521
What do you mean?

01:46:17.288 --> 01:46:21.165
This is a small apartment. There's not
enough room for your whole family.

01:46:21.166 --> 01:46:22.834
Can you stop that for a minute?

01:46:22.835 --> 01:46:25.253
What's the point? I gotta
be out of town next week...

01:46:25.254 --> 01:46:27.422
then I come back and
you're on the road.

01:46:27.423 --> 01:46:30.008
- I don't see you for weeks.
- I'm working. It's not a vacation.

01:46:30.009 --> 01:46:32.135
- It goes on. Nothing changes.
- I need these dates.

01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:35.305
- I got a million-dollar hole.
- That you dug for yourself.

01:46:35.306 --> 01:46:37.390
He was screwing things up.
We had to get him out.

01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:39.934
- Don't talk about things you don't know.
- He used you.

01:46:39.935 --> 01:46:43.354
He ridiculed you. He did everything
he could to destroy the group.

01:46:43.355 --> 01:46:46.258
- And you take his debts?
- He couldn't help himself!

01:46:47.151 --> 01:46:49.224
Oh, my God.

01:46:50.529 --> 01:46:52.614
Saint Francis, is that it?

01:46:52.615 --> 01:46:54.392
Kind to animals?

01:46:56.035 --> 01:47:00.235
I thought if you could get out of the
neighborhood maybe we'd have a shot.

01:47:00.789 --> 01:47:03.362
But you're never
gonna get out, are you?

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:14.085
What if we got married?

01:47:14.261 --> 01:47:17.210
You and Tommy? I don't
think that's legal in Nevada.

01:47:17.514 --> 01:47:20.767
- You don't give an inch, do you?
- I'm never gonna be first in line.

01:47:20.768 --> 01:47:25.674
I'm always gonna be standing behind
Tommy and Bobby and Nicky and Joey.

01:47:26.106 --> 01:47:28.008
Look, I gotta go.

01:47:28.442 --> 01:47:29.859
Go tomorrow.

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:33.013
Come to Boston.
We'll spend the weekend.

01:47:34.865 --> 01:47:36.950
I can't. I got things.

01:47:36.951 --> 01:47:40.620
Yeah, I know. Family and work.
And what's left, Frankie?

01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:43.274
Don't do this. Not now.

01:47:43.374 --> 01:47:44.821
Why?

01:47:45.167 --> 01:47:46.668
So we can have a drink?

01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:48.867
Go around one more time?

01:47:52.675 --> 01:47:54.952
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

01:47:55.886 --> 01:47:58.709
I gotta get off the merry-go-round.

01:47:59.098 --> 01:48:01.546
It's no fun anymore.

01:48:26.959 --> 01:48:31.409
Fourteen nine, 14,950, 15,000.

01:48:31.505 --> 01:48:33.532
Okay, we're good.

01:48:33.674 --> 01:48:35.917
Everybody's whole now, right?

01:48:35.968 --> 01:48:39.137
Frankie, you know it
was nothing personal.

01:48:39.138 --> 01:48:40.585
Norm...

01:48:40.597 --> 01:48:42.089
say goodbye.

01:48:45.477 --> 01:48:47.424
Take care, gentlemen.

01:48:48.772 --> 01:48:51.190
I told you, if you do the work,
everything follows.

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:53.013
Heh.

01:48:57.114 --> 01:48:58.606
Thanks.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.701
- Long life.
- Long life.

01:49:01.702 --> 01:49:03.228
Long life.

01:49:09.084 --> 01:49:12.078
Ah. It's my daughter Francine.
She calls every Friday at 10.

01:49:12.087 --> 01:49:13.296
That's good, Frankie.

01:49:13.297 --> 01:49:15.665
She's playing Victoria's
in Plainfield.

01:49:16.675 --> 01:49:19.761
Francine, just a second, okay?
Just a minute.

01:49:19.762 --> 01:49:21.254
Okay.

01:49:21.722 --> 01:49:23.920
- All right. Call me later.
- All right.

01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:28.674
Thanks again.

01:49:36.195 --> 01:49:38.939
Francine, you'll never
guess who was just here.

01:49:39.239 --> 01:49:41.699
- Excuse me?
<i>- You're the father of Francine Valli?</i>

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.034
Yes, this is her father.

01:49:43.035 --> 01:49:45.358
<i>This is the New York
Police Department.</i>

01:49:45.454 --> 01:49:47.948
Is something wrong? Is she all right?

01:50:06.433 --> 01:50:09.712
For this is our God,
forever and ever.

01:51:17.462 --> 01:51:19.910
Get you a plaque on this booth.

01:51:20.465 --> 01:51:22.082
How you doing?

01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:24.051
Never better.

01:51:24.052 --> 01:51:25.499
Yeah.

01:51:27.681 --> 01:51:30.425
I got something I
think belongs to you.

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.003
Open it.

01:51:38.317 --> 01:51:40.094
Crewe and I got together.

01:51:44.823 --> 01:51:48.898
Bob, I just buried a child.
You want me to sing a love song?

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.148
You gotta climb out
of this, Frankie. It'll kill you.

01:51:55.292 --> 01:51:57.990
She had a bigger range than me.
Did you know that?

01:51:58.921 --> 01:52:01.699
And in here, she had it.

01:52:04.218 --> 01:52:07.041
What was I supposed to do,
put her on a leash?

01:52:07.346 --> 01:52:08.998
Chain her to the bed?

01:52:10.057 --> 01:52:11.557
They grow up, they go out...

01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:16.555
and some stu cazzo with a bottle
of pills is waiting and it's over.

01:52:21.193 --> 01:52:23.220
Don't blame yourself.

01:52:24.238 --> 01:52:25.764
Really?

01:52:25.948 --> 01:52:27.520
Who, then?

01:52:34.373 --> 01:52:35.945
All right, look.

01:52:35.999 --> 01:52:37.821
Do me a favor.

01:52:38.126 --> 01:52:39.823
Just take it home.

01:52:40.087 --> 01:52:41.295
Look at it.

01:52:41.296 --> 01:52:44.757
There's something not right in the
release. Maybe you'll have an idea.

01:52:44.758 --> 01:52:47.786
- Bob, I don't know.
- Just look at it.

01:52:55.936 --> 01:52:58.759
Here. Wear this, would you?

01:52:59.690 --> 01:53:02.218
We don't need you
catching pneumonia too.

01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:17.999
Yeah.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.168
You know, the problem is you're
modulating up after the bridge...

01:53:21.169 --> 01:53:24.797
- ...and I don't think you should. You listening?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

01:53:24.798 --> 01:53:27.341
<i>Yeah, you know, your music...</i>

01:53:27.342 --> 01:53:30.219
and Crewe's lyric,
they're working really well together.

01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:34.625
You know, you goose it up too much,
I don't know, it gets cheesy.

01:53:35.434 --> 01:53:37.882
Maybe a few notes here and there.

01:53:38.061 --> 01:53:40.589
All right. Well, uh...

01:53:40.731 --> 01:53:43.850
Why don't you come over
tomorrow and we'll talk about it?

01:53:45.319 --> 01:53:47.062
Check my schedule.

01:53:48.363 --> 01:53:50.060
Good idea.

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.569
Okay, people, take five.
Five-minute break.

01:54:03.462 --> 01:54:06.047
I sprung for the session.
What else do you want?

01:54:06.048 --> 01:54:07.256
Release the song.

01:54:07.257 --> 01:54:10.509
I don't know what to do with it.
It's too hard for pop, too soft for rock.

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:12.219
But, Al, it's a new kind of song.

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:16.182
You're the president of a record company.
Do the right thing. Find the next thing.

01:54:16.183 --> 01:54:17.933
What are you busting my chops?

01:54:17.934 --> 01:54:21.354
You drag me down to hear some art
song that's never gonna get airplay.

01:54:21.355 --> 01:54:22.605
Okay, listen to me.

01:54:22.606 --> 01:54:25.107
Frankie's going through hell.
We've made you a lot of money.

01:54:25.108 --> 01:54:26.692
Come on. Do the right thing.

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:29.445
Because deep down, very,
very, very deep down...

01:54:29.446 --> 01:54:31.364
I know that you are a
decent human being.

01:54:31.365 --> 01:54:34.909
I'll be candid with you, my friend.
Frankie's okay. He's no Neil Sedaka.

01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:36.577
Then I want out of our contract.

01:54:36.578 --> 01:54:39.401
And I'm taking you to court
to get back our masters.

01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:41.165
You don't have the balls.

01:54:41.166 --> 01:54:42.692
Try me.

01:54:44.127 --> 01:54:47.797
Okay. Call me sentimental.

01:54:47.798 --> 01:54:49.423
Here's the deal:

01:54:49.424 --> 01:54:53.094
You get some stations to play it,
I'll release the damn song.

01:54:53.095 --> 01:54:54.470
They say no...

01:54:54.471 --> 01:54:57.807
you take your work of art and stick
it where the sun don't shine.

01:54:57.808 --> 01:54:59.642
Thank you, Al, you're a class act.

01:54:59.643 --> 01:55:02.922
It's very nice. Say hi to the kids.
Merry Christmas.

01:55:02.979 --> 01:55:04.647
Okay, folks, we're back.

01:55:04.648 --> 01:55:06.524
- So how did that go?
- Good. Very good.

01:55:06.525 --> 01:55:08.692
Noise. So where do you
wanna break the song?

01:55:08.693 --> 01:55:12.238
- Detroit. The Roostertail.
- Detroit. That's WJR.

01:55:12.239 --> 01:55:16.700
I know that guy. Marty something.
Mr. First Nighter.

01:55:16.701 --> 01:55:18.911
Three hundred pounds. Disgusting.

01:55:18.912 --> 01:55:20.496
So we get him in there...

01:55:20.497 --> 01:55:24.792
we lay on the food, we lay on the booze,
we give him the full treatment.

01:55:24.793 --> 01:55:26.794
The guy's a moron,
but he's not stupid.

01:55:26.795 --> 01:55:29.338
He hears the crowd,
you'll get airplay. Don't worry.

01:55:29.339 --> 01:55:31.465
- That's just Detroit.
- Let me finish.

01:55:31.466 --> 01:55:32.967
So we follow up.

01:55:32.968 --> 01:55:37.638
Philly, Boston,
Chicago, San Francisco.

01:55:37.639 --> 01:55:40.516
You start a little movement.
People start talking.

01:55:40.517 --> 01:55:43.269
They talk more.
It's a chain reaction.

01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:45.968
"Where did you find that song?"

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:49.275
All right.

01:55:49.276 --> 01:55:51.360
Stations start getting calls.

01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:53.696
"We wanna hear that song."

01:55:53.697 --> 01:55:55.281
"Where is that song?"

01:55:55.282 --> 01:55:57.241
"What is wrong with you people?"

01:55:57.242 --> 01:55:58.451
Okay, everybody.

01:55:58.452 --> 01:56:01.620
"Play the fucking song already!"

01:56:17.721 --> 01:56:22.297
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

01:56:22.726 --> 01:56:27.097
<i>Can't take my eyes off you</i>

01:56:27.481 --> 01:56:32.728
<i>You'd be like heaven to touch</i>

01:56:32.736 --> 01:56:37.323
<i>I wanna hold you so much</i>

01:56:37.324 --> 01:56:42.244
<i>At long last love has arrived</i>

01:56:42.245 --> 01:56:47.025
<i>And I thank God I'm alive</i>

01:56:47.209 --> 01:56:52.080
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:56.842
<i>Can't take my eyes off you</i>

01:56:56.843 --> 01:57:00.179
<i>Pardon the way that I stare</i>

01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:04.183
<i>There's nothing else to compare</i>

01:57:04.184 --> 01:57:07.645
<i>The sight of you leaves me weak</i>

01:57:07.646 --> 01:57:12.066
<i>There are no words left to speak</i>

01:57:12.067 --> 01:57:15.194
<i>But if you feel like I feel</i>

01:57:15.195 --> 01:57:18.948
<i>Please let me know that it's real</i>

01:57:18.949 --> 01:57:22.660
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

01:57:22.661 --> 01:57:27.111
<i>I can't take my eyes off you</i>

01:57:42.806 --> 01:57:45.516
<i>I love you, baby</i>

01:57:45.517 --> 01:57:49.478
<i>And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby</i>

01:57:49.479 --> 01:57:51.355
<i>To warm the lonely nights</i>

01:57:51.356 --> 01:57:53.649
<i>I love you, baby</i>

01:57:53.650 --> 01:57:58.112
<i>Trust in me when I say</i>

01:57:58.113 --> 01:58:01.115
<i>Oh, pretty baby</i>

01:58:01.116 --> 01:58:04.827
<i>Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby</i>

01:58:04.828 --> 01:58:09.623
<i>Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, baby</i>

01:58:09.624 --> 01:58:13.377
<i>Let me love you</i>

01:58:13.378 --> 01:58:17.047
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

01:58:17.048 --> 01:58:20.926
<i>Can't take my eyes off you</i>

01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:24.888
<i>You'd be like heaven to touch</i>

01:58:24.889 --> 01:58:28.767
<i>I wanna hold you so much</i>

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:32.146
<i>At long last love has arrived</i>

01:58:32.147 --> 01:58:36.025
<i>And I thank God I'm alive</i>

01:58:36.026 --> 01:58:39.396
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

01:58:39.613 --> 01:58:44.109
<i>Can't take my eyes off you</i>

01:58:52.667 --> 01:58:54.960
<i>I love you, baby</i>

01:58:54.961 --> 01:58:58.922
<i>And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby</i>

01:58:58.923 --> 01:59:00.716
<i>To warm the lonely nights</i>

01:59:00.717 --> 01:59:03.010
<i>I love you, baby</i>

01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:07.306
<i>Trust in me when I say</i>

01:59:07.307 --> 01:59:09.550
<i>Oh, pretty baby</i>

01:59:09.893 --> 01:59:12.102

01:59:12.103 --> 01:59:13.854

01:59:13.855 --> 01:59:19.151
<i>Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, baby</i>

01:59:19.152 --> 01:59:24.103
<i>Let me love you</i>

01:59:24.658 --> 01:59:30.736
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

02:00:43.111 --> 02:00:45.184
Wow.

02:00:48.324 --> 02:00:51.398
Nothing's changed except
for Frankie, right?

02:00:52.579 --> 02:00:55.914
Hey, hey. So you guys haven't
sung together in how long?

02:00:55.915 --> 02:00:57.583
- Twenty-five years.
- Twelve years.

02:00:57.584 --> 02:01:00.002
- Since 1912.
- Now that you sing your songs...

02:01:00.003 --> 02:01:01.587
what's different?

02:01:01.588 --> 02:01:04.423
The keys. They're a little lower.
Not for you, but for us.

02:01:04.424 --> 02:01:07.092
Are the songs tougher,
more meaning, different meaning?

02:01:07.093 --> 02:01:10.304
This is the first time we've sung
together tonight in a long time.

02:01:10.305 --> 02:01:11.680
So we'll find out tonight.

02:01:11.681 --> 02:01:13.849
- Good to know. Thanks.
- Is that Tommy?

02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:15.058
Hey, there's Tommy.

02:01:15.059 --> 02:01:16.631
There's Tommy.

02:01:18.271 --> 02:01:19.968
Hello, sir.

02:01:20.982 --> 02:01:23.510
- Good to see you.
- Bobby, good to see you.

02:01:23.693 --> 02:01:25.595
- Tommooch.
- Machoch.

02:01:27.363 --> 02:01:28.572
Good to see you.

02:01:28.573 --> 02:01:31.146
So I haven't seen these guys in ages.

02:01:32.076 --> 02:01:34.319
Good to see you, Frankie.

02:01:36.331 --> 02:01:38.199
How's life, Tommy?

02:01:38.625 --> 02:01:40.698
I can't complain.

02:01:43.797 --> 02:01:45.289
Here.

02:01:47.675 --> 02:01:50.427
All right. All right, Tommy.

02:01:53.389 --> 02:01:55.132
Let's go inside.

02:01:55.433 --> 02:01:57.059
<i>It's been over 20 years...</i>

02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:00.103
since these guys have appeared
on the same stage together...

02:02:00.104 --> 02:02:03.474
and what better stage for
a reunion than this one?

02:02:03.525 --> 02:02:06.276
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

02:02:06.277 --> 02:02:09.822
my old friends and
brand-new Hall of Famers:

02:02:09.823 --> 02:02:12.658
The original Four Seasons!

02:02:19.624 --> 02:02:21.875
<i>Rag doll, ooh</i>

02:02:21.876 --> 02:02:26.922
<i>I love you just the way you are</i>

02:02:26.923 --> 02:02:28.507
<i>Hand-me-down</i>

02:02:28.508 --> 02:02:34.471
<i>When she was just a kid
Her clothes were hand-me-downs</i>

02:02:34.472 --> 02:02:35.639
<i>Hand-me-down</i>

02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:41.520
<i>They always laughed at her
When she came into town</i>

02:02:41.521 --> 02:02:43.230
You know what I do now?

02:02:43.231 --> 02:02:45.107
I work for Joe Pesci.

02:02:45.108 --> 02:02:48.527
Little Joey Fishes. Same kid
I used to smack around.

02:02:48.528 --> 02:02:51.280
Couple of months ago we're driving
through the old neighborhood.

02:02:51.281 --> 02:02:54.825
He says, "Hey, Tommy, how do you
remember yourself back then?"

02:02:54.826 --> 02:02:56.443
I says:

02:02:56.452 --> 02:02:58.829
"I think I was a
pretty stand-up guy."

02:02:58.830 --> 02:03:00.706
He says, "I gotta be honest with you.

02:03:00.707 --> 02:03:02.457
You were a total prick.

02:03:02.458 --> 02:03:06.203
Nobody would have put up with your
shit except we all needed something."

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:09.089
Everybody remembers it the
way they need to, right?

02:03:09.090 --> 02:03:11.049
People always ask the same question:

02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:14.374
"Why'd you do it, Nicky?
Why'd you walk away?"

02:03:14.971 --> 02:03:17.123
Well, let me clear that up.

02:03:17.432 --> 02:03:20.434
It wasn't the side deal.
It wasn't the touring.

02:03:20.435 --> 02:03:24.187
It wasn't the bad food
or rooming with Tommy.

02:03:24.188 --> 02:03:26.590
It just came out of my mouth.

02:03:28.192 --> 02:03:30.139
Once I said it...

02:03:30.445 --> 02:03:32.563
I knew it was what I wanted.

02:03:33.323 --> 02:03:35.316
I wanted to go home.

02:03:35.491 --> 02:03:38.189
They ask you what was the high point?

02:03:38.703 --> 02:03:39.912
Hall of Fame?

02:03:39.913 --> 02:03:41.330
Selling all those records?

02:03:41.331 --> 02:03:43.608
Pulling "Sherry" out of the hat?

02:03:43.791 --> 02:03:45.818
It was all great.

02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:49.379
But four guys under a streetlamp...

02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:51.874
when it was all still ahead of us...

02:03:52.050 --> 02:03:54.384
first time we made that sound...

02:03:54.385 --> 02:03:56.128
our sound...

02:03:56.137 --> 02:04:01.008
when everything dropped away
and all there was was the music...

02:04:06.105 --> 02:04:08.132
That was the best.

02:04:08.483 --> 02:04:10.567
I'm not drawn to the
old neighborhood...

02:04:10.568 --> 02:04:12.903
my life never revolved around
the old neighborhood...

02:04:12.904 --> 02:04:15.853
I don't give a fuck about
the old neighborhood.

02:04:15.907 --> 02:04:18.408
I'm from wherever I happen to be.

02:04:18.409 --> 02:04:21.938
And these days,
that's Nashville, Tennessee.

02:04:21.955 --> 02:04:23.607
Just me...

02:04:23.623 --> 02:04:25.540
my beautiful wife...

02:04:25.541 --> 02:04:27.443
and a good cigar.

02:04:27.627 --> 02:04:29.795
Quiet and peaceful...

02:04:29.796 --> 02:04:31.171
in the knowledge...

02:04:31.172 --> 02:04:33.825
that none of this could
have happened...

02:04:34.968 --> 02:04:36.711
without me.

02:04:37.595 --> 02:04:38.804
By the way...

02:04:38.805 --> 02:04:42.641
you're ever in Vegas, go to any casino,
say the name Tommy DeVito.

02:04:42.642 --> 02:04:44.393
My hand to God...

02:04:44.394 --> 02:04:46.888
you'll be out of there
in about 12 seconds.

02:04:46.938 --> 02:04:49.181
All right, I'll be honest with you.

02:04:49.565 --> 02:04:53.310
It could have been an ego thing.
Everybody wants to be up front.

02:04:54.612 --> 02:04:57.356
But if there's four guys...

02:04:57.615 --> 02:04:59.688
and you're Ringo...?

02:05:03.997 --> 02:05:06.866
Better I should spend
some time with my kids.

02:05:08.042 --> 02:05:13.118
Like that bunny on TV with the battery,
I just keep going and going and going.

02:05:14.549 --> 02:05:16.542
Chasing the music.

02:05:18.386 --> 02:05:20.254
Trying to get home.

02:05:29.731 --> 02:05:33.025
<i>Who loves you pretty, baby?</i>

02:05:33.026 --> 02:05:36.486
<i>Who's gonna help you
through the night?</i>

02:05:36.487 --> 02:05:39.781
<i>Who loves you, pretty mama?</i>

02:05:39.782 --> 02:05:43.201
<i>Who's always there to make it right?</i>

02:05:43.202 --> 02:05:46.538
<i>Who loves you, pretty baby?</i>

02:05:46.539 --> 02:05:49.916
<i>Who's gonna help you
through the night?</i>

02:05:49.917 --> 02:05:53.754
<i>Who loves you, pretty mama?</i>

02:05:53.755 --> 02:05:56.673
<i>Who's always there to make it right?</i>

02:05:56.674 --> 02:05:58.633
<i>Who loves you?</i>

02:05:58.634 --> 02:06:01.678
<i>- Who loves you, pretty baby?
- Who's gonna love you, love you</i>

02:06:01.679 --> 02:06:04.923
<i>Who's gonna love you, Mama?</i>

02:06:05.016 --> 02:06:08.215
<i>Who loves you, pretty baby?</i>

02:06:21.157 --> 02:06:23.950
<i>Sherry</i>

02:06:23.951 --> 02:06:25.827
<i>Sherry baby</i>

02:06:25.828 --> 02:06:28.371
<i>Sherry</i>

02:06:28.372 --> 02:06:30.040
<i>Sherry baby</i>

02:06:30.041 --> 02:06:32.793
<i>Sherry</i>

02:06:32.794 --> 02:06:37.255
<i>- Sherry baby
- Baby</i>

02:06:37.256 --> 02:06:38.882
<i>Sherry baby</i>

02:06:38.883 --> 02:06:43.538
<i>Sherry, can you come out tonight?</i>

02:06:46.891 --> 02:06:49.510
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:06:49.894 --> 02:06:54.356
<i>Late December back in '63</i>

02:06:54.357 --> 02:06:58.693
<i>What a very special time for me</i>

02:06:58.694 --> 02:07:01.905
<i>As I remember what a night</i>

02:07:01.906 --> 02:07:04.825
Hey, Joey! You owe me five bucks.

02:07:04.826 --> 02:07:07.354
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:07:07.411 --> 02:07:12.040
<i>You know I didn't even know her name</i>

02:07:12.041 --> 02:07:16.378
<i>But I was never gonna be the same</i>

02:07:16.379 --> 02:07:18.964
<i>What a lady, what a</i>

02:07:18.965 --> 02:07:20.912
<i>Oh</i>

02:07:22.468 --> 02:07:24.928
<i>Oh, I</i>

02:07:24.929 --> 02:07:31.059
<i>I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room</i>

02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:33.854
<i>Yeah, and I</i>

02:07:33.855 --> 02:07:37.149
<i>As I recall it ended much too soon</i>

02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:38.597
You look marvelous.

02:07:40.319 --> 02:07:42.141
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:07:42.822 --> 02:07:47.409
<i>Why'd it take so long
to see the light?</i>

02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:51.538
<i>Seemed so wrong
But now it seems so right</i>

02:07:51.539 --> 02:07:54.124
<i>Sweet surrender, what a night</i>

02:07:54.125 --> 02:07:55.959
<i>I felt the rush</i>

02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:58.454
<i>Like a rolling bolt of thunder</i>

02:07:58.462 --> 02:08:02.174
<i>Spinning my head around
And taking my body under</i>

02:08:02.175 --> 02:08:03.918
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:09.131
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:13.128
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:08:15.062 --> 02:08:17.135
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:08:19.901 --> 02:08:22.645
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:08:23.863 --> 02:08:25.936
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:08:28.242 --> 02:08:31.111
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:08:32.622 --> 02:08:34.023
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:08:37.043 --> 02:08:39.116
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

02:08:41.422 --> 02:08:43.824
<i>Oh, what a night</i>
