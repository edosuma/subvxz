You X-Men were
allowed to enter,

the pleasure of
introducing you

00:17.500 --> 00:20.333
We can't
deceive and control

00:20.333 --> 00:24.500
Some day she'll discover
the truth, and turn against

use me has opened my eyes!

00:29.500 --> 00:31.375
No! Please!

00:33.250 --> 00:36.833
You had me do evil
to gain you power.

00:36.833 --> 00:40.500
But through this body,
I felt the thrill of
that evil.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.750
Now I thirst for more!

You wish me to
give up the body?

02:36.750 --> 02:38.125
Never!

02:39.750 --> 02:44.000
There is a power
beyond good and
evil,

02:44.000 --> 02:49.416
the power to create
and the power to destroy.

02:49.416 --> 02:51.625
Jean, can you hear me?

02:51.625 --> 02:57.000
Jean Grey
can hear nothing.
Speak only to the Phoenix.

I fear
Xavier's intuition
has proved prescient.

Through
Jean's keen human senses,
the Phoenix has experienced

04:00.125 --> 04:03.125
exhilarating new sensations

04:03.125 --> 04:05.208
I doubt
she wants to
give them up.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.250
(JEAN SCREAMING)

17:15.583 --> 17:20.375
In the battlefield
of the mind,
my will shall prevail!

17:20.375 --> 17:24.166
Do you really think
your puny mind
is a match for mine?

17:35.333 --> 17:40.083
As you once used
the power of the Phoenix
to bind the M'Kraan Crystal,

17:40.083 --> 17:43.375
I now
bind the Phoenix
with the power of...

17:43.375 --> 17:45.583
(XAVIER SCREAMING)

17:55.875 --> 18:00.000
The conceit of you humans,
the arrogance!

18:02.875 --> 18:08.833
Jean. If you can
hear me, help me.
Help me. Help me.

18:10.708 --> 18:15.875
This can't be. I am Phoenix!

18:15.875 --> 18:19.708
I now bind the Phoenix
with the power of my mind!

18:19.708 --> 18:21.458
No!

18:24.708 --> 18:26.875
No!

18:30.458 --> 18:31.708
(XAVIER GROANS)

18:31.708 --> 18:32.750
(JEAN GROANS)

18:34.166 --> 18:35.375
Professor!

18:36.125 --> 18:37.333
CYCLOPS: Jean!

18:44.000 --> 18:46.708
Professor,
will she be all right?

18:46.708 --> 18:48.416
Jeannie.

18:48.416 --> 18:51.625
The Phoenix is contained,
for now.

18:51.625 --> 18:55.708
I could never have defeated
the Phoenix if Jean herself
had not helped me.

18:55.708 --> 18:59.416
The strength of her
mind is truly awesome.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.375
Hi, four-eyes.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.083
Hi yourself, tiger.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.458
ROGUE: We got company.

19:10.458 --> 19:11.583
CYCLOPS: The Shi'ar.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.250
Greetings, Charles.

19:17.250 --> 19:20.291
Lilandra!
What is the matter?

19:20.708 --> 19:23.583
Why didn't you alert
me telepathically?

19:23.583 --> 19:29.583
Charles Xavier, it is
the decision of the High
Council of the Shi'ar Empire

19:29.583 --> 19:33.708
that the being known both
as the Phoenix and as
Jean Grey,

19:33.708 --> 19:36.000
must be destroyed!

19:36.000 --> 19:38.375
Lilandra, stop this!

19:38.375 --> 19:43.625
For the sake
of all that live,
Jean Grey must perish.
