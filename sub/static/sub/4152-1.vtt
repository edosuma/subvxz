01:01.850 --> 01:05.937
Last night I had an ugly nightmare.

01:06.813 --> 01:07.814
Oh, yeah?

01:08.315 --> 01:09.775
What happened, man?

01:10.359 --> 01:14.780
I'm lying down in my bed.
Then I get up...

01:15.405 --> 01:18.909
and there's my mother,
may she rest in peace...

01:19.493 --> 01:23.163
seated in a chair
with a plastic bag over her head...

01:23.288 --> 01:26.541
and she can't breathe.

01:26.958 --> 01:29.837
And I can't help her.

01:30.421 --> 01:32.423
Fuck.

01:50.942 --> 01:52.360
What do we do?

01:52.443 --> 01:54.696
We'll give them a half hour.

02:09.252 --> 02:10.669
Who are they?

02:12.004 --> 02:14.090
Don't worry.
It's just the police.

02:15.717 --> 02:19.137
This is a private road.
You have to have a permit.

02:19.262 --> 02:21.390
- Do you have a permit?
- I don't have a permit.

02:21.682 --> 02:23.392
Do you have a permit?

02:24.601 --> 02:27.062
Well, then, we have a problem.

02:27.146 --> 02:28.856
Can we buy a permit?

02:29.356 --> 02:32.901
Yeah, but it's gonna cost you.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.071
- How much?
- Four hundred pesos.

02:36.947 --> 02:39.074
You too-- 400 pesos.

02:48.834 --> 02:52.212
What's underneath the tarp?

02:52.796 --> 02:55.758
- Boxes of food.
- Show me.

03:16.696 --> 03:21.743
Lay down on the ground, sweetie.
You're under arrest.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.662
Yeah, you guys are screwed!

04:35.401 --> 04:37.069
What's your name?

04:40.239 --> 04:43.701
Javier Rodríguez Rodríguez.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.871
Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.044
You've done an excellent job.

04:55.755 --> 04:59.134
But we'll take over from here.

05:01.887 --> 05:05.474
Put the prisoners in the Suburban
and impound the truck.

05:18.612 --> 05:21.406
How did you find out about this?

05:23.367 --> 05:25.619
A little bird told me.

05:25.744 --> 05:28.038
What's the name
ofyour little bird?

05:30.624 --> 05:32.918
It doesn't have a name.

05:35.253 --> 05:38.048
Those fucking anonymous ones!

05:40.092 --> 05:43.303
For an officer of the state police...

05:44.888 --> 05:47.557
you're very well-informed.

05:56.818 --> 06:00.613
- Hey, was that General Salazar?
- The Big Boss himself.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.200
What is he doing around here?

06:04.325 --> 06:06.703
Up to something. I don't know.

06:08.204 --> 06:11.416
They took our handcuffs, Manolo.

06:13.251 --> 06:17.964
This informant, paid by police,
using taxpayers' dollars...

06:18.047 --> 06:20.633
to continue his felony
drug habit, was the link...

06:20.758 --> 06:23.636
that allowed the police
to raid a private farm,

06:23.761 --> 06:27.932
a working farm where honest
Americans make their living.

06:28.015 --> 06:31.811
The government, in its haste,
has hired an army of criminals...

06:31.894 --> 06:35.148
- whose allegiance to the truth
is at best questionable.
- Mr. Rodman...

06:37.066 --> 06:40.319
it's a shame that your client
didn't use as much sense...

06:40.403 --> 06:42.655
in choosing what he planted...

06:42.740 --> 06:45.159
as he did
in choosing his attorney,

06:45.242 --> 06:47.286
but, lately,
the only variation...

06:47.411 --> 06:51.582
I'm hearing in your argument
is the name of your client.

06:51.707 --> 06:55.335
You can stand here all day and argue
the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates,

06:55.461 --> 06:57.463
but you're not
gonna convince me...

06:57.546 --> 07:02.009
that our government has not sanctioned
the use of anonymous informants.

07:02.134 --> 07:06.638
Furthermore,
there is no sacred protection
of property rights in our country.

07:06.764 --> 07:11.602
You grow marijuana on your farm,
be it an ounce or an acre,

07:11.727 --> 07:14.021
that farm can be seized...

07:14.146 --> 07:16.356
and that farm can be sold.

07:19.318 --> 07:21.278
What the hell is that?

07:21.403 --> 07:25.532
You can tell a lot about somebody
from this stuff.

07:25.657 --> 07:29.620
- It's from your friends
at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
- A fishing rod.

07:29.745 --> 07:33.540
- What do you think they want?
- Depends what state they're from.

07:33.665 --> 07:36.544
Uh... Arizona.

07:36.669 --> 07:39.381
Arizona.

07:39.506 --> 07:41.633
Medicinal marijuana initiative.

07:41.758 --> 07:43.635
Or am I being cynical?

07:43.760 --> 07:47.222
Mark... I'm gonna miss you.

07:47.347 --> 07:49.557
Thank you for all your hard work.

07:58.149 --> 08:00.068
Hi. How are you today?

08:00.151 --> 08:02.904
You've got a daughter.
Why is it important to get
a handle on this drug problem?

08:03.029 --> 08:05.573
Because it's an issue
that affects all families.

08:05.699 --> 08:08.702
- But I'm planning on being
back here as much as I can.
- How do you feel about--

08:37.440 --> 08:39.942
Okay, Gordon, no telltales:
no scratching your nose,

08:40.067 --> 08:42.111
no clearing your throat,
no crossing your legs.

08:42.236 --> 08:44.113
- I got it.
- You got it, babe.

08:44.238 --> 08:47.283
I'm cool, man.
You just don't tell any jokes.

08:47.408 --> 08:50.453
- " Don't tell any jokes"?
- Don't tell jokes.
It's a giveaway, Ray.

08:50.578 --> 08:53.289
- It's not a giveaway.
- Every time you tell a joke,
it's a giveaway.

08:53.414 --> 08:56.292
- Don't tell any jokes.
- You know what the problem is?
You are too uptight, man.

08:56.417 --> 08:58.794
Why don't you loosen up,
take a deep breath?

08:58.919 --> 09:00.963
Breathe in slowly.
A little stretching maybe.

09:01.088 --> 09:02.965
- Come on, man. They're looking at us.
- Come on, man.

09:03.090 --> 09:06.010
We're gonna get these motherfuckers.
We know our shit.

09:06.135 --> 09:08.804
Can I get it?
Can I get it?

09:08.929 --> 09:11.640
- Oh, baby, can I say it?
- Say it. It's show time.

09:16.979 --> 09:20.150
We're looking for Mr. Eduardo Ruiz.
We have a 2:00 appointment.

09:20.275 --> 09:22.819
He's right down the hallway
in the back room.

09:22.944 --> 09:24.821
Thank you.

09:31.036 --> 09:34.247
Come in. Hey, fellas.

09:34.373 --> 09:36.333
Come on, you guys. Get him talking.

09:36.458 --> 09:39.669
- Get him outside.
- How you doing?

09:39.753 --> 09:42.589
- I'm well. How are you?
- I'm good.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.677
Look, what's up, Ed?
We gonna move some white or what?

09:47.803 --> 09:50.514
You guys ever bought
a quarter ton before?

09:50.597 --> 09:52.724
- No?
- I don't think so.

09:52.849 --> 09:56.728
It's a big fucking deal, all right?

09:56.853 --> 09:58.730
It's not like you can stick it
in a condom up some mule's asshole.

09:58.855 --> 10:01.525
How many peasants is that
gonna take? You'd have a line
from here to Mexico City.

10:01.650 --> 10:07.239
You say show up at a time, we show up at
the time and we're fucking sitting here.

10:07.364 --> 10:10.534
- Sure I can't offer you
something to drink?
- I can offer you ajoke.

10:10.659 --> 10:14.038
You want to hear a joke? I got
a joke, I got a joke. Come on, bro.

10:14.122 --> 10:16.374
It's just a joke. Let me tell one joke.
I'm gonna tell you a joke.

10:16.457 --> 10:20.712
All right, why are hurricane
named after women?

10:20.837 --> 10:24.048
- I don't know.
- Because when they arrive,
they're wet and wild.

10:24.173 --> 10:26.968
When they leave, they take
your house and your car.

10:28.678 --> 10:31.305
- It's true.
- You didn't find that funny?

10:31.431 --> 10:33.307
I chuckled. Damn.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.352
- Fellas... that's us.
- Yo.

10:41.232 --> 10:46.571
Okay, that's the van. Don't make
your move until they get Ruiz outside.

10:50.575 --> 10:54.078
I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.249
I got another joke.

10:58.332 --> 11:00.752
- Come on. Please.
-Just one more. Relax.

11:00.877 --> 11:03.254
A guy goes, gets a tattoo
put on his penis.

11:03.379 --> 11:05.966
One side says yes,
the other side says no.

11:06.091 --> 11:08.260
- On his penis?
- Yeah. The words "yes" and "no."

11:08.385 --> 11:13.766
So, his wife says, "Hold it. You tell me
how to cook, how to clean the house--"

11:13.849 --> 11:16.602
- Who the fuck is that?
- That's local.

11:16.727 --> 11:19.521
What the fuck is going--

11:19.646 --> 11:21.857
Shit! Agent down!

11:21.982 --> 11:23.484
Get in there now! Go!

11:36.580 --> 11:40.084
- D.E.A.!

11:48.717 --> 11:50.886
The vest caught it.
Go ahead.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.972
Go. Shit.

12:29.801 --> 12:32.429
Shit!

13:35.659 --> 13:39.205
- I think we lost him, Ray.
- Yeah, I think so too.

13:41.540 --> 13:44.920
- Don't fucking move!
Get your hands-- Move!

13:45.045 --> 13:47.047
Get out, you son of a bitch!
Get out!

13:47.172 --> 13:51.593
Is this what
they wear to go to sleep...

13:51.718 --> 13:54.596
or do they hang out like this
the whole time?

13:54.721 --> 13:58.809
That would be sleep attire.
- It's like a smoking jacket.

13:58.934 --> 14:01.311
He's gonna be smoking
in a minute.

14:01.436 --> 14:04.356
Okay, who's the father of
Greek tragedy? Anyone? Anyone?

14:04.481 --> 14:06.983
Okay, Aeschylus it is.
His trilogy? The Oresteia.

14:07.109 --> 14:11.822
This is fucking beautiful. Can anyone--
Can anyone stop the Seth machine?

14:11.947 --> 14:15.617
- No.
- That's correct. Score.

14:18.578 --> 14:21.123
And "tragedy" is closed out.

14:23.750 --> 14:26.128
- But wait.

14:26.253 --> 14:29.256
- Is he her husband?
- Yes.

14:29.381 --> 14:33.427
Oh, hey, so, uh...
you want to try something?

14:34.594 --> 14:36.514
Yeah.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.818
- What are you doing?
-Just watch.

15:03.916 --> 15:08.171
What you're going to do is
inhale the smoke and hold it.

15:08.296 --> 15:10.339
What is this, like freebase?

15:10.465 --> 15:13.384
Not "like." It is.

15:16.846 --> 15:19.348
Okay, go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.939
Hold it.
Hold it.

15:29.068 --> 15:30.944
See?

15:33.947 --> 15:35.866
Now you see.

16:08.857 --> 16:12.403
Oh, how-- Oh, they're doing great.

16:12.528 --> 16:15.239
Look at how cute they are.

16:15.364 --> 16:18.742
- Helena, he's doing so good.
- Little Tiger.

16:18.867 --> 16:21.830
Little Tiger, I hope.

16:21.955 --> 16:24.582
We'll be very happy if he
becomes the next Tiger Woods.

16:24.666 --> 16:26.584
So will his bank balance.

16:26.668 --> 16:29.587
- My God. Duck?
- Duck. Thank you very much.

16:29.713 --> 16:31.923
- Helena, you never order duck.
- I know, I know.

16:32.048 --> 16:35.760
It's not me who ordered it.
It's somebody else.

16:35.844 --> 16:38.430
Well, he or she
has very good taste.

16:38.555 --> 16:40.807
- I love duck, don't you?
- It's delicious.
Do you want some, Nan?

16:40.932 --> 16:44.978
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
- It's such a fatty bird.

16:45.103 --> 16:47.647
There's good cholesterol,
and there's bad cholesterol,
which is confusing to me.

16:47.772 --> 16:51.443
- Mmm, that's so good.
- You know what they say about red wine.

16:51.568 --> 16:53.695
It's good for you.
There's cholesterol in my wine.

16:53.820 --> 16:56.614
- You're allowed to have your red wine.
- The French do, don't they?

16:56.740 --> 16:58.616
I'm European.
I say that to my doctor.

16:58.742 --> 17:01.786
"I'm European.
I'm allowed to drink red wine."

17:01.911 --> 17:04.122
Oh, my doctor said it was fine
when I was pregnant.

17:04.247 --> 17:07.291
- A glass a week.
- After my amnio,

17:07.416 --> 17:09.627
he said, "Okay, now you can go
and have a glass ofred wine."

17:09.752 --> 17:13.007
- I had two.

17:16.594 --> 17:19.305
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

17:19.430 --> 17:21.307
- Thanks a lot.
- Can I bring the bag
in the backwith me?

17:21.432 --> 17:24.185
- No, sweetheart.
- How about just my putter?

17:24.310 --> 17:26.479
- Give me the putter.
- All right.

17:26.604 --> 17:29.648
In you get. Come on.
We've got to go.

17:29.774 --> 17:32.485
Put this down here, okay?

17:32.610 --> 17:35.112
That's where Tiger Woods keeps it.
Thank you.

17:35.237 --> 17:38.324
- You're welcome.
- Okay.

17:38.449 --> 17:43.996
David, you're gonna have to promise me,
no swinging the club in the car.

17:44.121 --> 17:45.664
Okay.

17:46.290 --> 17:51.003
Until you officially take over the
Office of National Drug Control Policy,

17:51.128 --> 17:54.048
under no circumstances will you speak
to the press unprotected...

17:54.173 --> 17:56.092
without going through this office...

17:56.217 --> 17:58.511
or having someone in the room.

17:58.636 --> 18:00.846
There are a lot of interests
in this town.

18:00.971 --> 18:02.848
Right now,
they're scared of you.

18:02.973 --> 18:07.687
The reason they're scared
of you: Technically, you have
veto powers over their budgets.

18:07.771 --> 18:10.190
You'll also be meeting
senators and congressmen,

18:10.315 --> 18:12.526
each with a specially
prepared question.

18:12.651 --> 18:16.196
They're questions designed for
one thing-- to make them look smart.

18:16.321 --> 18:18.573
If you lecture them,
they won't think you respect them.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.159
If you treat them
with utter humility, they will.

18:21.284 --> 18:24.705
This is about your respect for them
and the president's respect for them.

18:24.830 --> 18:27.708
Speaking of which, when he
gets back from Russia and China,

18:27.833 --> 18:31.211
we'll get you two together for
some face time, let you two catch up.

18:31.336 --> 18:35.298
Also, one month from today,
you will give your first
official press conference.

18:35.424 --> 18:40.220
In it, you will outline the president's
strategy for winning the war on drugs.

18:40.345 --> 18:43.265
Judge, I just want to be
clear about one thing:

18:43.390 --> 18:45.559
I am not a partisan person,
I am an issue person.

18:45.684 --> 18:48.228
Over the course of the next few weeks,
if you allow me,

18:48.353 --> 18:50.897
I will bring you up to speed
on an incredible array of issues,

18:51.022 --> 18:54.317
the most important ofwhich,
in my opinion, Mexico.

18:54.443 --> 18:57.572
I know everyone you're going to meet.
I know what they want and why.

18:57.697 --> 18:59.907
It is important
that they like you.

19:00.032 --> 19:02.243
It is not important
that they like me.

19:02.368 --> 19:04.912
That is why
I can help protect you.

19:05.038 --> 19:07.749
Like you protected Landry?

19:07.874 --> 19:10.084
I see where you're going with that.

19:10.209 --> 19:14.255
If I could say one thing: Basically,
a guy like Landry is so autocratic,

19:14.380 --> 19:16.883
he doesn't even know how
to let himself be helped.

19:17.008 --> 19:21.429
There's a political component
to this job that the general
didn't have any patience for.

19:21.637 --> 19:24.515
General, Bob Wakefield.

19:21.763 --> 19:24.599
General, Bob Wakefield.

19:24.724 --> 19:27.852
-Judge, nice to meet you. Thank you.
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.

19:27.935 --> 19:32.273
-Jeff, you want to excuse us?

19:32.398 --> 19:34.859
Yes, sir.
I'll be right outside.

19:34.942 --> 19:37.445
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

19:37.570 --> 19:39.530
You've done a fine job, General.

19:39.614 --> 19:42.116
The Office of National
Drug Control Policy...

19:42.241 --> 19:44.744
is in better shape
than when you found it.

19:44.869 --> 19:47.955
I'm not sure I made
the slightest difference.

19:48.081 --> 19:51.460
I tried. I really did.

19:51.585 --> 19:54.463
I think there are some positive signs.
The work's just started.

19:54.588 --> 19:56.840
I plan on seeing it through.
You can count on that.

19:56.965 --> 20:00.302
You're here for two years,
three maximum.

20:00.427 --> 20:03.889
What'd they offer you,
a court appointment?

20:03.972 --> 20:07.309
District? Appeals?
Not Supreme.

20:07.434 --> 20:11.647
This is a tough enough job.
I plan on focusing on this.

20:13.774 --> 20:17.361
You know, when Khrushchev
was forced out,

20:17.486 --> 20:20.656
he sat down, he wrote two letters
and gave them to his successor.

20:20.781 --> 20:26.495
He said, "When you get yourself
into a situation you can't get out of,

20:26.620 --> 20:30.165
"open the first letter,
and you'll be saved.

20:30.290 --> 20:33.335
"And when you get yourself into
another situation you can't get out of,

20:33.460 --> 20:35.504
open the second letter."

20:35.629 --> 20:38.841
Well, soon enough, this guy
found himself in a tight place,

20:38.966 --> 20:44.472
so he opened the first letter,
which said, " Blame everything on me."

20:44.597 --> 20:47.350
So, he blamed the old man.
It worked like a charm.

20:47.475 --> 20:50.019
He got himself into a second situation
he couldn't get out of,

20:50.145 --> 20:52.021
and he opened the second letter.

20:52.147 --> 20:56.693
It said, "Sit down
and write two letters."

21:00.655 --> 21:03.408
Yeah.

21:15.045 --> 21:17.213
Don't you want to know
what kind of car it is?

21:17.338 --> 21:22.052
- It's a brown Ford Explorer.
- It was here. It's been stolen.
I want to file a report.

21:22.135 --> 21:25.221
A report will not help you
find your car.

21:25.346 --> 21:28.725
- The police won't find your car.
- You are the police.

21:28.850 --> 21:34.482
- You call this man...
and he'll find your car.
- I don't get it.

21:34.607 --> 21:37.401
How is this guy gonna know
who has our car?

21:37.526 --> 21:39.570
The police will tell him.

21:39.695 --> 21:42.239
Why will they tell him,
and they won't tell us?

21:42.364 --> 21:44.283
Because we pay him, stupid.

21:44.408 --> 21:47.078
Right? And he pays the police,
and suddenly our car appears.

21:47.203 --> 21:50.247
Es correct.
Es correct.

21:50.373 --> 21:53.918
Just give him the money.
Give him the money.

21:54.043 --> 21:56.754
- Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
- Here, take it.

21:56.879 --> 21:59.340
- No. No, no.
- No, please, take it.

21:59.465 --> 22:03.094
Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
Let's go to the sidewalk.

22:03.219 --> 22:06.222
Call the man.
Have a nice day.

22:24.573 --> 22:27.619
-Javier Rodriguez.
- Si.

22:33.125 --> 22:35.627
We want you to come with us.

22:37.003 --> 22:40.090
- Where?
- It's just a short trip.

22:43.301 --> 22:44.219
Follow me.

22:44.302 --> 22:46.221
Bien.

22:57.441 --> 22:59.526
I would say one thing
to you,Judge,

22:59.651 --> 23:02.988
and that's you're never gonna solve
this problem on the supply side.

23:03.113 --> 23:05.657
As long as that demand
is out there in our cities,

23:05.782 --> 23:08.243
Mexico bashing is not gonna do
a damn thing for you.

23:08.326 --> 23:12.664
We in the legal drug business--
Merck and Pfizer and the rest
of my very important clients--

23:12.789 --> 23:16.543
realize that we're not fighting
a war here with a traditional
winner and loser.

23:16.668 --> 23:18.545
I don't know that
you can win this war.

23:18.670 --> 23:20.548
Everybody says we want
to declare war on drugs,

23:20.673 --> 23:24.010
but if 25% of high school seniors
are using drugs--

23:24.135 --> 23:27.013
-If you reduce that to 10,
that's a great improvement.
- Right.

23:27.138 --> 23:29.515
I'll congratulate you.
That would be a phenomenal achievement,

23:29.640 --> 23:32.643
but you'd still have 10%
habitually using drugs.

23:32.769 --> 23:34.937
Can I get a scotch and soda, please?

23:35.021 --> 23:37.356
The price of coke
and heroin has dropped,

23:37.482 --> 23:40.193
but purity has increased.

23:40.276 --> 23:43.738
All this law enforcement
has really achieved is that
kids get better stuff cheaper.

23:43.863 --> 23:46.365
Education, rehabilitation,
prevention--

23:46.491 --> 23:48.367
that's not significant
to these reporters.

23:48.493 --> 23:50.370
- Mm-hmm.
- They want to see people in prison.

23:50.495 --> 23:53.456
They want to see the gory aspect
of the drug problem.

23:53.539 --> 23:55.458
Thank you so much for sharing
your point of view.

23:55.541 --> 23:57.877
- I look forward to working
with you in the future.
- Well, call me.

23:58.002 --> 24:00.380
I have a good bill
on treatment-on-demand.
I could use your help.

24:00.505 --> 24:02.965
- Wonderful. Look forward to it.
Thanks, Senator.
- Okay. Great.

24:03.049 --> 24:05.927
If a judge or a politician is willing
to put a reefer in their mouth,

24:06.052 --> 24:07.929
- I'll do a story on it.
- Right.

24:08.054 --> 24:09.931
- Stand up and be independent.
- Right.

24:10.056 --> 24:12.393
I don't care who's president. I don't
care who the members of congress are.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.395
I don't care
who you have to deal with.

24:14.520 --> 24:19.108
If you're independent and you
use that bully pulpit right,
that's where your power is.

24:19.233 --> 24:21.110
It's the stick of law enforcement
that creates...

24:21.235 --> 24:23.237
the carrot of huge profit
that is economic truth.

24:23.362 --> 24:25.280
Addicts don't vote.

24:31.954 --> 24:33.872
What the hell
are you doing here?

24:36.041 --> 24:38.419
You like your view?

24:38.544 --> 24:42.339
- TV screen big enough?
- How's the food?

24:45.217 --> 24:47.761
Hope it's all good because this
is as good as it's gonna get...

24:47.886 --> 24:50.597
for a long time, Eduardo.

24:50.723 --> 24:54.017
I'm a legitimate businessman.
I've got tuna boats. I'm a fisherman.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.019
- Check it out!
- Shut the fuck up!

24:56.103 --> 24:58.522
- Fucking can it, bitch!
- You can't come in here like that!

24:58.605 --> 25:00.107
- I want to see my lawyer.
- Okay.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.776
It's cool, man.

25:02.901 --> 25:05.947
- Eddie... you're in a lot of trouble.
- It's cool.

25:10.577 --> 25:13.621
You know what? The amount of coke
we found on this creep--

25:13.747 --> 25:17.000
- that's capital punishment
in some states, right?
- Yeah, down in Texas.

25:17.125 --> 25:19.002
- They'll fry him.
- Definitely.

25:19.127 --> 25:21.004
We've got him making
the deal on tape.

25:21.129 --> 25:23.965
We got him bragging
about the quality, about his business.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.468
- We got this motherfucker.
- You're fucked.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.595
No, no, he's fucked.

25:32.432 --> 25:34.434
I only see one way
out of this predicament.

25:42.067 --> 25:44.402
You make us believe
you got a boss, Eddie.

25:46.488 --> 25:48.490
Look, no boss, it's all on you.

25:48.615 --> 25:50.575
No.

25:50.658 --> 25:53.495
No, that's a death sentence.
I'd never make it to the trial.

25:53.620 --> 25:57.500
- Look, we're gonna protect you.

25:57.583 --> 26:00.419
- Who you working for?
- This is coercion.

26:02.505 --> 26:04.507
That's a big word
for a fisherman.

26:04.632 --> 26:07.551
Big-ass word.
Who you working for?

26:07.676 --> 26:10.846
I know another big word.

26:10.971 --> 26:12.973
Immunity.

26:18.979 --> 26:20.940
Take it easy, will you?

26:21.023 --> 26:22.942
What's going on in here?

26:23.025 --> 26:25.027
- We have a warrant
to search your premises.
- What?

26:25.152 --> 26:27.154
Carl!

26:27.279 --> 26:29.365
My husband!

26:29.490 --> 26:31.367
- Relax. Ma'am.
- Carl!

26:31.492 --> 26:33.786
Ma'am, right here.
You can't go any further.

26:33.869 --> 26:36.622
- David, come here!
- Ma'am, I have a search warrant.

26:36.706 --> 26:38.416
He'll be back.

26:38.541 --> 26:42.878
Where are they taking Daddy?

26:43.003 --> 26:44.922
He'll be all right.

26:46.674 --> 26:48.885
He's all right. They're just gonna
take him to the office and talk.

26:49.010 --> 26:50.887
Just relax.
They're not going to hurt him.

26:51.012 --> 26:53.223
- I don't understand what's going on.
- He'll be all right.

26:53.348 --> 26:55.892
- What are they doing to Daddy?
- Daddy's gonna be okay.

26:56.017 --> 26:59.730
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay, baby.

27:15.579 --> 27:17.122
Not you.

27:17.247 --> 27:18.206
You.

27:22.836 --> 27:24.713
I'll wait here.

27:25.630 --> 27:29.092
Five years with the Tijuana police.

27:30.927 --> 27:33.722
Three years in the state police.

27:35.932 --> 27:41.481
Your parents died when their house
flooded in the rains of '93.

27:43.775 --> 27:45.902
How unfortunate.

27:50.615 --> 27:55.578
You make $316 a month.

27:57.830 --> 27:59.916
That's what they pay.

28:00.666 --> 28:02.293
Well, look.

28:05.630 --> 28:09.384
This could be your past.

28:12.220 --> 28:16.015
We can talk about your future...

28:17.892 --> 28:20.853
if you can do me a favor.

28:21.312 --> 28:23.231
If I can.

28:26.901 --> 28:31.948
I want to wipe out
the Tijuana cartel.

28:35.994 --> 28:38.497
What can I do to help?

28:42.334 --> 28:45.254
His name is Francisco Flores.

28:45.879 --> 28:48.173
He's an assassin.

28:48.257 --> 28:51.969
He runs guns for the Tijuana cartel.

28:53.345 --> 28:56.056
I have to talk to him.

28:56.181 --> 29:00.602
I need you to find him
and bring him here.

29:02.020 --> 29:05.357
- This is crazy!
- Don't freak out, Manolo.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.735
Don't you know
who "Frankie Flowers" is?

29:10.112 --> 29:14.366
A hired assassin! A psychopath!
Fucking crazy!

29:14.450 --> 29:18.328
- Who knows how many he's killed!
- Then I'll go by myself.

29:19.037 --> 29:21.290
And we can't ask for help...

29:21.373 --> 29:23.792
because he lives in San Diego.

29:31.676 --> 29:33.553
Ah.

29:33.678 --> 29:38.058
Well... is this
a surprise or what?

29:38.183 --> 29:40.226
An honor.
Thank you.

29:40.351 --> 29:42.562
- Hi, sweetie.
- Good trip?

29:42.687 --> 29:46.566
- How are you?
- Good trip. I'm good.
I just can't believe this.

29:46.649 --> 29:50.236
- What's Washington like?
- It's like, uh--

29:50.361 --> 29:53.406
It's like Calcutta;
surrounded by beggars.

29:53.531 --> 29:56.409
Only these beggars
are wearing $1,500 suits...

29:56.534 --> 29:59.537
and they don't say
"please" and "thank you."

30:01.998 --> 30:04.459
So, we put
the case before the arbitration panel,

30:04.584 --> 30:07.003
none of whom have
any expertise.

30:07.087 --> 30:09.005
"Superfund" is just
one of those words.

30:09.089 --> 30:11.007
People stop paying attention.

30:11.091 --> 30:15.470
- It's frustrating.
- It's so frustrating.

30:15.595 --> 30:17.472
Did you meet the president?

30:17.597 --> 30:20.101
Honey, your father
knows the president.

30:20.226 --> 30:23.104
It just so happens... that
the president of the United States,

30:23.229 --> 30:25.106
my new boss,
the leader of the free world,

30:25.231 --> 30:28.359
has penciled me in
for a little face time.

30:28.442 --> 30:31.779
None of my friends can fucking believe
my dad's actually the drug czar.

30:31.862 --> 30:36.784
- Caroline.
- I'm sorry, but, I mean, come on.

30:36.867 --> 30:39.787
It's great.
It's great, Daddy.

30:39.912 --> 30:43.457
It's just amazing, that's all.

30:49.296 --> 30:51.173
Arnie, thank God.

30:51.298 --> 30:53.634
Helena, I am so--

30:53.718 --> 30:55.803
Please tell me
what's going on here.

30:55.928 --> 30:58.806
What is going on? They came into
the house. They just took him away.

30:58.931 --> 31:01.475
They searched my home.

31:01.600 --> 31:04.019
Let me tell you what's happening.
All right?

31:05.438 --> 31:08.816
First of all, Carl is not here.

31:08.941 --> 31:11.319
The D.E.A. has got him.

31:11.445 --> 31:13.488
They're gonna hang onto him
until his arraignment,

31:13.613 --> 31:15.991
which will probably be tomorrow.

31:16.116 --> 31:19.995
So here you are wasting your time.
All right? Are you with me?

31:20.120 --> 31:23.540
- Yeah.
- Okay. Now, do not discuss anything...

31:23.665 --> 31:26.168
over the telephone.

31:26.293 --> 31:29.504
Don't talk to your neighbors.
Stay out of your yard.

31:29.629 --> 31:32.340
- What is he charged with, Arnie?
- I don't know,

31:32.466 --> 31:37.262
but under no circumstances
am I going to talk about it here.

31:37.345 --> 31:41.516
Now, you go home and be with your son.
All right?

32:36.197 --> 32:38.074
Miss?

32:38.199 --> 32:40.243
Can I have a Budweiser?

32:48.751 --> 32:51.796
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

32:51.921 --> 32:54.966
Can you give me a cigarette?

33:51.483 --> 33:54.778
It would be interesting to know
how you did it so quickly.

33:56.488 --> 33:59.657
We all have our weak side.

34:01.659 --> 34:05.205
The path of the Lord
is very subtle.

34:05.663 --> 34:06.498
Amen.

34:15.465 --> 34:17.342
What a badass.

34:21.346 --> 34:26.184
All I'm saying--
What I'm-- What I'm saying is...

34:26.309 --> 34:30.522
it never seems like anyone ever says
anything that matters to them.

34:30.647 --> 34:35.025
We all look at each other
and nod with these--

34:35.150 --> 34:41.033
these responses
that we've been trained to make.

34:41.117 --> 34:43.202
Responses--
Not real responses.

34:43.327 --> 34:48.373
Social conventions,
like phony, fake smiles;

34:48.498 --> 34:50.543
surface bullshit.

34:50.668 --> 34:52.712
Do I ever just say:

34:52.837 --> 34:56.549
" Hey... I'm uncomfortable
in this crowd."

34:56.674 --> 34:59.051
"I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing either."

34:59.176 --> 35:03.389
"l know you're afraid,
and that's okay, you know, because--"

35:03.514 --> 35:07.226
Hello? Fucking... exactly.

35:07.351 --> 35:09.228
We act like we have all the answers
and we're totally invincible...

35:09.353 --> 35:11.230
like our parents seem
and their parents before them.

35:11.355 --> 35:14.567
I'm sorry I have to be the one
to say this, but it's fucking bullshit.

35:14.692 --> 35:17.403
- For instance?
- I know you jack off
to Caroline every night,

35:17.528 --> 35:19.572
instead of Vanessa,
who you're supposed to be in love with.

35:19.697 --> 35:23.409
Don't even get me started
on that convention.

35:23.534 --> 35:25.411
Because what is that convention?

35:25.536 --> 35:27.788
We're this random collection
of self interests,
and all of a sudden we decide...

35:27.913 --> 35:32.460
that we're gonna walk two-by-two
down the fucking aisle to Noah's Ark?

35:32.585 --> 35:36.256
Actually, for your information,
when I jerk off,

35:36.381 --> 35:39.760
I'm not just thinking about Caroline,
I'm thinking about you with Caroline.

35:39.885 --> 35:42.596
- So, how about that?
- Baby--

35:44.389 --> 35:49.269
That is what
I'm talking about-- sarcasm.

35:49.394 --> 35:52.606
Always fucking sarcasm.

35:52.731 --> 35:56.276
You're afraid, and you think
that if you admit that,

35:56.401 --> 35:58.779
people will think
that you are weak...

35:58.904 --> 36:01.948
or they won't like you...

36:02.074 --> 36:05.619
or whatever it is
you think will happen, but--

36:05.744 --> 36:09.956
Can you shut up for one second
and listen to yourself?

36:10.082 --> 36:11.958
Wh-What?

36:12.084 --> 36:17.339
Because you are so fucking right.

36:17.464 --> 36:19.633
- I'm so fucking high.
- Yeah?

36:19.758 --> 36:22.010
- Yeah.
- Okay, wait.

36:22.135 --> 36:24.137
Why don't we...

36:24.262 --> 36:27.975
change this thing,
this social pattern?

36:28.101 --> 36:29.685
Why don't we be different?

36:29.811 --> 36:33.314
- Yeah.
- But then why are you
even talking about it?

36:33.439 --> 36:35.650
But we're making it,
like, from now on.

36:35.775 --> 36:39.362
You're like,
"Why don't we do something?"

36:39.487 --> 36:41.906
- Why don't you do something?
- That's what I'm saying, Seth.

36:41.989 --> 36:45.410
- You do it yourself--
- I'm saying if you knew it,
you wouldn't even say it.

36:45.493 --> 36:47.412
Vanessa, I'm serious, I feel fucked up.

36:47.495 --> 36:51.707
It's a social pattern, you know?

36:55.336 --> 36:59.507
Spence, baby, are you all right?

36:59.632 --> 37:01.551
He's fucking blue.
He isn't breathing.

37:01.676 --> 37:04.762
Oh, my God, Fucked-up Bowman's
fucked up.

37:04.846 --> 37:08.182
- Wait--
- What the fuck do we do?

37:08.266 --> 37:11.561
- Uh-- Oh, God--
- Fuck!

37:11.686 --> 37:15.565
- Somebody call a doctor!
- Wait, your dad's a doctor. Call him.

37:15.690 --> 37:18.026
No, he's a research--
Call your dad. He's a doctor.

37:18.152 --> 37:20.946
- What kind of research?
- Mapping the fucking pig genome.

37:21.029 --> 37:23.240
Call your dad!
He's a neurosurgeon!

37:23.365 --> 37:25.451
I can't call my dad!
It's 3:00 in the morning!

37:25.534 --> 37:29.538
He's gonna fucking die right here
on the floor if you don't do something!

37:29.663 --> 37:33.667
No, he can't die on the floor!
His parents are in Barbados!

37:43.886 --> 37:45.888
Move! Move!

38:04.073 --> 38:08.243
Okay, nobody has anything
on them, right?

38:08.368 --> 38:10.245
Fuck!

38:18.755 --> 38:22.509
We know that you killed
our chief of intelligence.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.221
We also know that you...

38:26.679 --> 38:32.394
killed police chiefs
in Tijuana and Mexico City.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.439
A question.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.609
Why do you resist?

38:44.280 --> 38:47.033
My father has money.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.537
That is not the correct answer.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.624
We also found out...

38:54.749 --> 38:58.545
that you hunted down
a neighbor of General Salazar.

38:58.628 --> 39:01.172
A poor peasant.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.509
Your people killed
his granddaughter.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.513
That was a stupid thing to do.

39:08.639 --> 39:11.016
- You fucked up.

40:05.030 --> 40:08.200
I'm on the board
of my son's school.

40:08.325 --> 40:14.039
I have fund-raisers
for adult literacy at my own home.

40:15.832 --> 40:20.587
I think I have a right to know if
my husband is a legitimate businessman.

40:20.712 --> 40:23.215
Of course he is.

40:23.340 --> 40:27.511
I've known Carl for 20 years.
He doesn't even jaywalk.

40:31.848 --> 40:37.229
Carl is a very important member of this
community, and when we get through...

40:37.312 --> 40:39.731
suing the police and
the district attorney and the D.E.A.,

40:39.856 --> 40:44.236
they're gonna be renaming
the public parks after your husband.

40:47.824 --> 40:51.577
Carl is very, very good
at his business.

40:54.872 --> 40:59.419
Which is smuggling illegal drugs
into this country.

41:12.682 --> 41:14.934
- They're whispering.
They're whispering.
- I know.

41:15.059 --> 41:18.604
- Can't hear it.
- I know. The fucking bug's
too far away from the room.

41:18.730 --> 41:21.107
It's halfway to the kitchen.
We're not gonna get shit.

41:21.190 --> 41:23.109
They're saying something.

41:23.192 --> 41:25.695
Sounds like they're conspiring
to conspire.

41:25.778 --> 41:28.281
I can feel the lies vibrating
from their home.

41:30.742 --> 41:32.618
I don't think
she's in on it, man.

41:32.744 --> 41:36.289
Come on, I dream about this.
I have actual dreams about this.

41:36.414 --> 41:39.459
About busting the top people,
the rich people.

41:39.584 --> 41:42.296
- White people. Hey.
- White people. I know, I know.

41:42.379 --> 41:45.132
I don't think she's in on it, man.

41:45.257 --> 41:48.135
She knows Arnie Metzger.

41:48.260 --> 41:50.804
So does half of San Diego.

41:50.929 --> 41:53.640
- You want to bet?
- Get in your pocket.

41:53.766 --> 41:55.809
- I got--
- I love it. I love it when you do this.

41:55.934 --> 41:59.813
- How much you want to bet? How much?
- I got-- I got 12 bucks.

41:59.938 --> 42:03.484
- Okay, give me ten. We'll make it even.
- Okay.

42:03.609 --> 42:06.612
- Beautiful.
- Wait a minute. What?

42:10.616 --> 42:13.869
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

42:15.496 --> 42:17.623
Live with your parents?

42:17.748 --> 42:20.125
Yes.

42:20.209 --> 42:22.127
Parents still together?

42:22.211 --> 42:24.129
Yes.

42:25.964 --> 42:29.676
- Do you work?
- I volunteer.

42:29.802 --> 42:33.890
I read to blind people,
one day a week for two hours.

42:35.308 --> 42:37.185
In school?

42:37.310 --> 42:40.021
Yes.

42:40.146 --> 42:42.023
Private?

42:42.148 --> 42:44.025
Yeah.

42:45.777 --> 42:48.196
How are your grades?

42:48.279 --> 42:53.034
- I'm third in my class.
- What does that mean?

42:53.118 --> 42:58.039
- I get A's, all A's.
- You do?

42:58.164 --> 43:00.542
What else do you do?

43:00.667 --> 43:02.877
I'm a National Merit Finalist.

43:03.002 --> 43:06.005
I'm on the Hi-Q Team
and the Math Team.

43:06.131 --> 43:08.716
I'm in the Spanish Club.
I'm a thespian.

43:08.842 --> 43:11.886
I'm vice president of my class.

43:12.011 --> 43:13.888
I'm on the volleyball team.

43:18.351 --> 43:21.146
You want to tell me
what you're doing here, Caroline?

43:40.249 --> 43:42.126
Carol.

43:43.711 --> 43:46.255
Oh, sweetie.

43:49.133 --> 43:51.093
You okay?

43:52.762 --> 43:54.680
It's okay.

43:56.390 --> 43:59.018
Caroline, how well did you know
this boy that overdosed?

43:59.101 --> 44:02.438
He didn't hang around us.

44:02.563 --> 44:05.274
He was like one
of those hippie kids.

44:05.399 --> 44:07.610
I'm not part of that group.

44:09.278 --> 44:14.575
How well did you know this boy Seth,
the one that was driving?

44:16.327 --> 44:19.289
He's a friend.

44:19.414 --> 44:23.585
He's also the only one that was doing
anything about the situation.

44:23.668 --> 44:28.048
He definitely had
a few beers, but...

44:28.131 --> 44:30.300
it's not like
he wanted to drive.

44:30.425 --> 44:32.928
We just didn't know
what else to do.

44:33.053 --> 44:36.640
It wasn't my pot.

44:39.101 --> 44:43.105
Okay, we understand, honey.
We've got to talk.

44:43.230 --> 44:45.273
Alone.

44:53.448 --> 44:56.159
- I think she's lying.
- Me too.

44:56.284 --> 44:58.829
So let's ground her,
clip her wings:

44:58.954 --> 45:02.165
school, scheduled activities
till further notice.

45:02.290 --> 45:07.546
Robert, honey, Caroline
clearly used very bad judgment,

45:07.671 --> 45:12.844
but don't you think spending a night
in jail is punishment enough?

45:12.969 --> 45:16.180
I mean, we've all
had our moments.

45:16.305 --> 45:20.393
- Lord knows, I tried
every drug there was--
- I don't want to hear about that.

45:20.518 --> 45:23.354
You experimented
when you were in college.

45:23.479 --> 45:25.356
Shall we take the quotes off
experiment and call it what it was?

45:25.481 --> 45:27.358
- This is different.
- Why?

45:27.483 --> 45:32.697
- She's 16 years old!
- I think she needs to find out
for herself, on her own.

45:32.822 --> 45:36.367
- We have to allow her room
to figure out--
- You want to give her room?

45:36.492 --> 45:38.619
So she can O.D.
like that other kid?

45:38.703 --> 45:42.874
I am not sending out the message that
our family will accept this behavior...

45:42.999 --> 45:44.876
because we do not.

45:45.001 --> 45:48.296
- Correct?
- Of course, but we don't want
to push her away.

45:48.379 --> 45:53.551
She has to know that we understand
what she's exposed to.

45:53.676 --> 45:56.179
How long have you known
about this?

45:58.681 --> 46:01.059
How long have you known?

46:04.021 --> 46:05.981
Six months.

46:13.197 --> 46:17.076
My technique is more profound
than yours, Javier.

46:18.368 --> 46:20.621
Much more profound.

46:21.163 --> 46:23.999
When he loves me like a father,

46:24.083 --> 46:27.086
he will never tell anyone
he was here.

46:28.796 --> 46:32.174
He will give me
the names of his superiors.

46:32.591 --> 46:37.054
Then we get them
and they too will give us names.

46:39.723 --> 46:45.646
And eventually somebody
will get us to Juan Obregón.

46:47.648 --> 46:52.778
And on that day,
the Tijuana cartel will fall.

47:08.294 --> 47:10.255
What a disgrace.

47:12.257 --> 47:14.801
What a disgrace, Francisco Flores.

47:16.261 --> 47:19.597
It's all right. Salazar is here.

47:21.307 --> 47:24.561
You're among friends now.

47:25.019 --> 47:28.148
This shameful treatment
will stop immediately.

47:28.940 --> 47:30.483
Guard!

47:31.192 --> 47:31.985
Yes, General.

47:35.572 --> 47:38.366
Are you responsible for this?

47:38.491 --> 47:41.536
- We are not savages!
- Yes, General.

47:41.661 --> 47:44.080
- Has he eaten?
- I don't know, sir.

47:44.664 --> 47:48.043
- Go get him some clothes.
- Yes, General.

47:51.338 --> 47:55.009
Your Honor, this is a man who heads
a large criminal organization...

47:55.134 --> 47:59.513
with international contacts
we can only begin to understand.

47:59.638 --> 48:02.183
Our case against him is very strong.

48:02.308 --> 48:06.854
He is not a flight risk.
His flight is assured.

48:06.979 --> 48:10.858
The people ask that Your Honor
deny bail. Thank you.

48:12.151 --> 48:14.195
My client is no more
a flight risk...

48:14.320 --> 48:16.447
than Your Honor
or the able prosecutor.

48:16.530 --> 48:18.532
He's a pillar
of his community;

48:18.657 --> 48:22.536
a family man with a wife and child
living in La Jolla,

48:22.620 --> 48:25.122
the communitywhere he has made
his home for the past 20 years.

48:25.206 --> 48:27.124
As our defense
will quickly show,

48:27.208 --> 48:29.126
my client is guilty
of nothing more...

48:29.210 --> 48:32.129
than being the handy target
of an admitted criminal.

48:32.213 --> 48:35.591
Therefore, we ask that you release
Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.

48:37.176 --> 48:39.053
I'm going to deny bail.

49:10.585 --> 49:13.422
I appreciate you coming in
so early this morning.

49:13.547 --> 49:15.757
Judge Wakefield,
it's an honor to handle it.

49:15.882 --> 49:18.927
She's a minor. It probably would have
expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.

49:19.052 --> 49:23.932
Nevertheless, this is asensitive issue
for me. I'm sure you can understand.

49:24.057 --> 49:27.602
Like I said, open container,
P.I., misdemeanor possession.

49:27.728 --> 49:29.604
It's easy to make it go away.

49:29.730 --> 49:34.944
One thing bothers me: The kid they
dropped off had coke and heroin in him.

49:35.069 --> 49:38.072
Serious amounts.
He's lucky he's alive.

49:38.197 --> 49:40.783
So I've got to ask:
What's your daughter on?

49:40.908 --> 49:43.161
I don't know what you mean.

49:43.286 --> 49:48.541
I mean... have you asked her
what kind of drugs she's tried?

49:52.086 --> 49:53.963
No.

49:54.088 --> 49:56.966
I don't know.

49:57.091 --> 50:00.970
- Is she in any kind of therapy,
professional help?
- No, no, no. No way.

50:01.095 --> 50:04.098
My daughter is one of
the leading students in her school.

50:08.811 --> 50:11.689
Well, I hope it stays that way.

50:20.281 --> 50:22.200
Yeah, hi, it's Robert.

50:22.325 --> 50:26.121
I want you to clean out my schedule
for the next three days.

50:26.205 --> 50:30.292
Because I'm tired of talking to experts
who've never left the beltway.

50:30.417 --> 50:33.170
It's time
to see the front lines.

51:08.163 --> 51:11.208
Carlos Ayala started out
in the family connection business--

51:11.333 --> 51:16.213
real estate in Tijuana,
fishing boats out of Ensenada,
hydroponic strawberries.

51:16.338 --> 51:18.842
Then he met up with the Obregon brothers
ofthe Tijuana cartel.

51:18.967 --> 51:21.386
Using regression analysis,
we made a study...

51:21.469 --> 51:25.390
of the custom lines at the border
and calculated the odds of a search.

51:25.515 --> 51:28.560
The odds are not high, and we found
variables to reduce those odds.

51:28.685 --> 51:31.229
So, you pay off
customs officials?

51:31.354 --> 51:34.899
Well, you know, in Mexico...

51:35.024 --> 51:38.236
law enforcement is
an entrepreneurial activity.

51:38.361 --> 51:40.989
Not so much in the States.
Anyway, we, uh--

51:41.072 --> 51:44.200
We hire drivers with nothing to lose and
throw a lot of product at the problem.

51:44.325 --> 51:47.078
Some get stopped. Enough get through.
It's not difficult.

51:47.203 --> 51:52.250
Look, boys, this has worked for years.
It's gonna continue to work for years.

51:52.375 --> 51:55.837
NAFTA makes things even
more difficult for you because
the border's disappearing.

51:55.920 --> 51:59.424
Do you realize in the next
year or two at the outside
Mexican trucking companies...

51:59.549 --> 52:02.594
are gonna be able to go from the States
to Mexico and back again...

52:02.719 --> 52:06.598
with the same freedom
as U.P.S., D.H.L., FedEx?

52:06.723 --> 52:11.812
- It's gonna be a free-for-all.
- What, are we on Larry King
or something?

52:11.937 --> 52:14.273
Shit.

52:14.356 --> 52:16.776
Tell us something
we don't know, Eddie.

52:16.901 --> 52:20.112
You guys remind me of those Japanese
soldiers left on deserted islands...

52:20.237 --> 52:22.948
who think World War II
is still going on.

52:23.074 --> 52:27.495
Let me be the first to tell you,
your government surrendered
this war a long time ago.

52:27.620 --> 52:30.664
I don't think all this attitude
is gonna help in front of a jury.

52:30.790 --> 52:34.126
- It's really a bad attitude.
- Very bad. Very bad.

52:35.920 --> 52:39.423
Look, Ed, there's only one problem
with all this math. You're in here.

52:42.760 --> 52:44.637
Well, I got greedy, didn't I?

52:44.762 --> 52:46.972
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

52:47.098 --> 52:50.476
Decided to bring a little in on my own
and somebody tipped you off.

52:50.559 --> 52:52.978
Carl never would have
been so stupid.

52:53.104 --> 52:56.857
Well, Carl hired you.
That was a mistake.

52:59.819 --> 53:02.739
Carl and I have been friends
since we were little kids.

53:04.282 --> 53:06.159
He was loyal.

53:10.997 --> 53:12.833
Javi.

53:12.958 --> 53:15.460
A group of us are going to a party.

53:15.585 --> 53:17.295
Who?

53:17.379 --> 53:22.759
Esteban, Guzmán, Tomás,
all of them.

53:23.093 --> 53:25.178
Your new buddies.

53:26.721 --> 53:28.473
Yes.

53:28.557 --> 53:30.183
- Let's go.
- No.

53:30.308 --> 53:33.145
- It'll be fun.
- Another day.

53:37.232 --> 53:40.861
At my house I have
some B&W speakers.

53:41.778 --> 53:45.407
A while ago I bought a CD burner.

53:45.532 --> 53:49.411
I make CDs with the music I want.

53:50.287 --> 53:53.665
Just like I bought them in a store.

53:54.500 --> 53:58.337
You and I have a lot in common.
Not everything, but a lot.

53:58.421 --> 54:02.633
We both studied on the other side
with the gringos.

54:04.010 --> 54:06.512
Your father is an engineer, right?

54:06.596 --> 54:10.141
My father-- may he rest in peace--
was also an engineer.

54:12.060 --> 54:15.688
I've been into stereos
since I was very young.

54:16.814 --> 54:19.233
Most people don't care...

54:19.984 --> 54:24.739
but for me it's very important.

54:35.917 --> 54:38.544
They say in Latin:

54:38.669 --> 54:41.881
In vino veritas.
Wine brings out the truth.

54:45.093 --> 54:47.888
Use this to write down...

54:48.847 --> 54:53.310
the addresses of those bastards
who killed my captains.

54:55.270 --> 54:59.400
And not where they were last week,
but where they are now.

54:59.483 --> 55:02.528
Where they are this minute.

55:02.861 --> 55:06.865
And better yet,
where they are going to be tomorrow.

55:10.786 --> 55:14.915
You know where they are going
to be tomorrow, right?

55:57.083 --> 56:01.087
Reported by the government
news agency, Notimex (NTX) :

56:02.756 --> 56:08.678
"Yesterday, forces of the Mexican Army,
acting on an anonymmous tip...

56:09.846 --> 56:16.102
joined with police to arrest members
of the Obregón brothers drug cartel.

56:17.187 --> 56:23.485
Head of the Federal Drug Forces, Gen.
Arturo Salazar, said in Mexico City...

56:23.568 --> 56:29.324
that the sweep was a crippling blow
to the Obregón brothers...

56:29.407 --> 56:34.997
who reportedly dominate
the narcotics trade...

56:35.122 --> 56:41.337
in the city of Tijuana
and the rest of Baja California state.

56:42.630 --> 56:49.178
General Salazar wen t on to say that
the au thorities were working overtime...

56:50.221 --> 56:57.269
to confirm that Porfirio Madrigal,
head of the rival Juárez cartel...

56:58.104 --> 57:02.983
died last week during
a plastic surgery procedure."

57:05.319 --> 57:07.071
Here it is, here it is.

57:09.782 --> 57:11.826
Get out, asshole.

57:12.576 --> 57:14.620
- Are you going to kill me?
- No.

57:15.454 --> 57:18.374
No, the Obregóns
will do that for us.

57:40.313 --> 57:42.232
The port of San Ysidro, California:

57:42.315 --> 57:46.236
45,000 vehicles on average,
25,000 pedestrians per day.

57:51.783 --> 57:55.620
- In the last six months,
a threefold increase?
- Increase in narcotics seizures.

57:55.704 --> 57:59.416
Would that mean, pro rata, three times
as much drugs is getting in?

57:59.541 --> 58:02.711
That's a scary way to figure it,
but I believe that's true.

58:02.794 --> 58:06.131
In my heart, I'd love to say
that we were getting 60 or 70%.

58:06.256 --> 58:11.052
In the reality, we're more like 40 or
50% of the total that's approaching us.

58:11.136 --> 58:13.388
And it's all big-dollar issues now.

58:13.472 --> 58:15.390
That's the reason you're seeing
a lot of these murders taking place.

58:15.474 --> 58:17.810
It's one organization
fighting another organization.

58:17.935 --> 58:19.812
When things are good,
people don't kill each other.

58:19.937 --> 58:21.981
When things are bad,
when they're losing dope,

58:22.106 --> 58:23.983
when they're losing drivers
and guys are going to jail,

58:24.108 --> 58:26.110
people start killing each other.

58:34.827 --> 58:38.664
- How's David?
- "How's David?"

58:38.790 --> 58:42.376
- Oh, he's terrific, Carl. Terrific.
- Oh, Helena--

58:42.502 --> 58:44.796
He watched his father
being dragged away by federal agents.

58:44.879 --> 58:47.882
- He's just doing fine.
- Okay.

58:48.007 --> 58:50.635
I can't even begin
to tell him where you are...

58:50.718 --> 58:53.304
and when you're coming home,
if you're ever coming home.

58:53.387 --> 58:57.475
Helena... we're gonna get through this.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.519
I promise.

58:59.602 --> 59:04.023
- I'll make it up to you.
- Do you have any idea
what's going on out here?

59:04.148 --> 59:07.235
Huh? Our credit cards are maxed.

59:07.360 --> 59:12.616
The people in the bank--
you should see the way they
look at me when I walk in.

59:12.699 --> 59:14.827
I have a letter
from the government telling me...

59:14.910 --> 59:18.872
anything I sell from the house will be
taken against an income tax lien.

59:18.956 --> 59:22.084
Our fucking friends--

59:22.209 --> 59:25.671
Nobody will help us.
Nobody will take us in.

59:25.796 --> 59:28.799
Nobody wants anything
to do with us, Carl.

59:28.882 --> 59:32.136
So, you just tell me
how you're gonna make it up to me.

59:33.429 --> 59:36.056
Helena--

59:36.181 --> 59:39.184
Just tell me what to do.

59:39.268 --> 59:42.354
I'm not bringing a child into the life
that I was brought up into.

59:42.479 --> 59:44.815
I won't do it, Carl.

59:44.898 --> 59:47.901
I want our life back.

01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:44.667
Yeah, we're smarter.
We know the difference.

01:00:44.793 --> 01:00:48.505
Hello. Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.382
- Hi, folks.
- Hello.
- Hi. Room 310, please.

01:00:51.466 --> 01:00:56.180
- Okay, I need to see some
I.D.s, please, and $28.
- Okay.

01:00:58.015 --> 01:01:00.101
Man, I love this place.

01:01:23.666 --> 01:01:27.461
I wish we could
just stay here.

01:01:27.545 --> 01:01:31.507
Just be here forever
and ever and...

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:34.218
make a little home here.

01:01:45.855 --> 01:01:49.067
I want to, uh...

01:01:49.192 --> 01:01:53.655
I want to have sex and then do a hit
right as we're both coming.

01:02:00.412 --> 01:02:02.330
Okay.

01:02:37.491 --> 01:02:40.203
The first time I got laid
was on a beach just like that.

01:02:41.621 --> 01:02:45.083
- You got a what on a beach?
- Got laid, man.

01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:47.877
Lost my virginity,
was a sophomore in high school.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.338
- That's cool.
- Yeah, it was sweet.

01:02:51.547 --> 01:02:53.424
Did he treat you good?

01:03:09.065 --> 01:03:11.442
- Who's this guy?
- I don't know.

01:03:11.526 --> 01:03:13.778
- I never seen him before.
- He's going right for the kid.

01:03:18.282 --> 01:03:20.159
David!

01:03:22.203 --> 01:03:24.622
David, come back here!

01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:28.709
- Mom, Mom.
- Please, put down my son.

01:03:28.793 --> 01:03:31.213
Shouldn't let
your kid wander off with strangers.

01:03:31.296 --> 01:03:35.175
Karen, if he tries to move
with that kid, you break cover.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:39.763
Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes
a lot of money. Snapping this
kid's neck wouldn't cover it.

01:03:39.888 --> 01:03:42.808
You better come up with it in a hurry
or your kid is gonna disappear,

01:03:42.891 --> 01:03:45.519
and he won't turn up
until the evening news.

01:03:45.644 --> 01:03:49.148
You get only one warning.
First payment is $3 million.

01:04:13.839 --> 01:04:17.885
-Javier.
- Yes?

01:04:20.137 --> 01:04:21.805
What's up, Ana?

01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:26.603
Manolo never came home last night.

01:04:27.228 --> 01:04:29.606
Come in, come in. Sit down.

01:04:35.028 --> 01:04:37.363
I don't know where he is.

01:04:38.198 --> 01:04:40.033
He wasn't with you last night?

01:04:40.116 --> 01:04:42.035
No.

01:04:45.497 --> 01:04:47.165
I'm worried.

01:04:47.248 --> 01:04:49.959
Don't worry too much.
It makes you ugly.

01:04:50.251 --> 01:04:53.421
Do you want a coffee?
Coffee with sugar?

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:55.548
- No.
- No?

01:04:56.925 --> 01:04:59.302
Look, Javier.

01:05:00.595 --> 01:05:02.931
I was going through his clothes
the other day.

01:05:04.933 --> 01:05:07.143
Look what I found.

01:05:10.522 --> 01:05:12.273
What is it?

01:05:19.156 --> 01:05:23.452
- What were you doing?
- I was with friends from work.

01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:27.623
Was Salazar there?

01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:31.252
No.

01:05:31.335 --> 01:05:33.963
The general is going
to Mexico City next week...

01:05:34.088 --> 01:05:36.298
and I'm not going
to get left behind.

01:06:01.407 --> 01:06:03.117
Javier Rodriguez.

01:06:03.242 --> 01:06:06.412
The word is you're not
that happy in your work.

01:06:06.579 --> 01:06:09.332
Maybe we can help.

01:06:27.726 --> 01:06:30.771
-John, how are you?
Bob Wakefield, pleasure.
-Judge, welcome.

01:06:30.896 --> 01:06:33.023
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Long time, no see.

01:06:33.148 --> 01:06:35.776
EPIC is very unique.

01:06:35.901 --> 01:06:39.738
It's a facility that has over 15
different agencies--state and local--

01:06:39.821 --> 01:06:42.240
that participate
in gathering intelligence...

01:06:42.324 --> 01:06:44.659
and making sure
that information gets out...

01:06:44.743 --> 01:06:48.705
to people in the field that need it
to stop drug trafficking.

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:53.668
From here, we have the ability
to track vessels, airplanes, boats,

01:06:53.752 --> 01:06:55.837
anything that carries drugs.

01:06:55.962 --> 01:06:59.341
When the information comes in,
we're able to check
with different databases...

01:06:59.424 --> 01:07:01.344
to see if it's
in the system or not.

01:07:01.427 --> 01:07:04.138
And would most of that energy
be focused on the two cartels?

01:07:04.263 --> 01:07:08.684
The Juarez, the Obregon brothers--
Are those the two that would be
most important?

01:07:08.768 --> 01:07:11.354
Those are the two
clearest threats right now.

01:07:11.479 --> 01:07:14.107
They are the dominant force
in trafficking,

01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:16.275
both on the Mexican side
and in the U.S.

01:07:16.359 --> 01:07:19.487
How are the cartels achieving...

01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:22.740
the level of intelligence and
sophistication that they're showing?

01:07:22.865 --> 01:07:25.827
- Craig, why don't you answer that?
- An unlimited budget.

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:28.496
So, you're saying, actually,
that even a country of our size...

01:07:28.621 --> 01:07:32.333
and the budget that we throw
towards this issue,

01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:35.628
- they can compete at the same level?
- No, they're way beyond us.

01:07:35.711 --> 01:07:39.090
- "Way beyond"?
- Our budgetary process
makes us pale in comparison.

01:07:42.135 --> 01:07:46.431
That house you're looking at over there
used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.

01:07:46.556 --> 01:07:48.891
His nickname was Scorpion.

01:07:49.016 --> 01:07:51.060
I'll let you figure out
what that means.

01:07:51.185 --> 01:07:53.689
Wasn't that the guy
who died during plastic surgery?

01:07:53.772 --> 01:07:56.066
Best of our information, yes.

01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:58.610
Who do you interact with
on that side?

01:07:58.736 --> 01:08:01.029
Nobody.

01:08:01.113 --> 01:08:03.741
Well, who has my job in Mexico?

01:08:03.866 --> 01:08:06.994
Your position doesn't exist
over there yet.

01:08:14.793 --> 01:08:17.504
I want
everyone thinking out of the box...

01:08:17.587 --> 01:08:19.590
for the next few minutes.

01:08:19.673 --> 01:08:22.341
What are we doing about Mexico?

01:08:22.426 --> 01:08:25.679
- Come on, guys, out of the box.
- Unlimited funds?

01:08:25.763 --> 01:08:27.890
Unlimited.

01:08:28.015 --> 01:08:31.852
From a D.E.A. standpoint, we need
a vetted task force and matching funds.

01:08:31.935 --> 01:08:35.606
And cut the red tape on getting them
equipment and training.

01:08:35.731 --> 01:08:37.649
Come on, guys,
I want to hear from everyone:

01:08:37.774 --> 01:08:40.527
F.B.I., customs, treatment.

01:08:42.112 --> 01:08:44.238
- Is there anybody from treatment
on this plane?
- No, Judge.

01:08:44.363 --> 01:08:47.410
Then, I want to know why there isn't
anybody from treatment on this plane.

01:08:47.535 --> 01:08:49.496
Yes, sir.

01:08:49.621 --> 01:08:53.582
We need to take down one of
these cartels--Juarez or Tijuana--

01:08:53.707 --> 01:08:55.752
not because they're a symbol, but--

01:08:55.877 --> 01:09:00.799
Hell, they are a symbol.
But because we need to send a message.

01:09:00.924 --> 01:09:04.594
When Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler
as his legal defense,

01:09:04.719 --> 01:09:07.764
I send Ben Williams
down to San Diego as a prosecutor.

01:09:07.889 --> 01:09:10.809
Why? Because it's a symbol.

01:09:10.892 --> 01:09:14.104
It's a symbol that
we are sending the best.

01:09:14.187 --> 01:09:18.733
It's a message that we're
going after their top guys.

01:09:18.817 --> 01:09:21.319
So...

01:09:21.403 --> 01:09:23.446
right now...

01:09:23.571 --> 01:09:27.117
on this flight only...

01:09:27.242 --> 01:09:29.661
the dam is open...

01:09:29.743 --> 01:09:32.956
for new ideas.

01:09:43.091 --> 01:09:45.803
On a clear day,
you can see Mexico City.

01:09:45.928 --> 01:09:49.473
I have this place swept twice a day,
so just feel free to talk.

01:09:49.598 --> 01:09:53.519
I learned that back
in Miami in '85.

01:09:53.602 --> 01:09:55.646
U.S. shut down
the entire Caribbean.

01:09:55.771 --> 01:10:00.067
- It's a big game of whack-a-mole.
You knock it down in Miami--
- Arnie, I need money.

01:10:00.192 --> 01:10:03.487
Somebody-- I think it was the Obregons--
threatened David.

01:10:03.571 --> 01:10:06.866
They want a first payment
of $3 million.

01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:10.161
Oh, Helena.

01:10:10.286 --> 01:10:13.664
I'd give it to you myself, but I-I-I
just don't have that kind of money.

01:10:13.748 --> 01:10:15.666
Please. Does anyone owe us money?

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:20.337
Yes, there are people that do owe
you money, but nobody's gonna pay.

01:10:20.463 --> 01:10:23.299
Carl's got too much heat on him.

01:10:23.382 --> 01:10:27.511
What about our other businesses,
our legitimate businesses?

01:10:27.636 --> 01:10:31.558
- Don't we own a construction--
- Laundromats wash the money.

01:10:31.641 --> 01:10:33.852
Just tell me something
positive, Arnie.

01:10:33.977 --> 01:10:36.688
Give me some good news,
for Christ's sake.

01:10:36.772 --> 01:10:38.732
I'm sorry.

01:10:43.695 --> 01:10:46.698
I just keep wondering what's
gonna happen if he doesn't get out.

01:10:46.823 --> 01:10:50.285
Just never been
on my own before.

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:54.039
Always had someone. Always.

01:11:01.588 --> 01:11:06.551
I remember the first time
that I saw you--

01:11:06.676 --> 01:11:11.598
little Helen Watts
from the wrong side of somewhere.

01:11:11.723 --> 01:11:17.521
Somehow I knew even then that your
survival skills were pretty well honed.

01:11:17.604 --> 01:11:21.233
Glad you think so, Arnie.

01:11:21.316 --> 01:11:26.030
I just keep picturing a debt-ridden,
30-year-old mother of two...

01:11:26.114 --> 01:11:30.243
whose ex-husband
is being compared to Pablo Escobar.

01:11:32.161 --> 01:11:36.249
I don't know anyone who wants
to be with someone like that.

01:11:38.793 --> 01:11:39.585
Do you?

01:11:39.877 --> 01:11:40.670
Do you?

01:12:14.412 --> 01:12:17.040
You two don't like me, do you?

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:21.754
Miss, with all due respect,
we don't have an opinion.

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:23.964
Maybe it's because
I'm going to have...

01:12:24.089 --> 01:12:26.133
the nicest home you've ever seen
in your miserable lives.

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:30.888
The old man actually
kept his promise.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:35.309
The general is a man of his word.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:40.189
They will say anything
to get what they want...

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:45.486
and then it's always
tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.

01:12:45.569 --> 01:12:48.781
Occupational hazard, I guess.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.974
- The bags?

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:22.524
-My love, it's beautiful! How beautiful!

01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:25.026
How are you feeling? Good?

01:13:26.444 --> 01:13:28.780
How handsome you are.

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:40.041
Listen...

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:42.544
the Scorpion is alive.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:46.506
Get in.

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:53.930
Porfirio Madrigal
isn't dead after all!

01:13:54.681 --> 01:13:58.393
That means that Salazar is working
for the Juárez cartel.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:02.773
I can't believe
this doesn't matter to you.

01:14:04.024 --> 01:14:06.068
This is nothing new, Manolo.

01:14:06.193 --> 01:14:09.697
That's why Salazar is so interested
in cleaning up Tijuana.

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:12.450
And he has plans for Juan Obregón,
the bastard.

01:14:13.701 --> 01:14:15.703
That's right.

01:14:17.413 --> 01:14:20.916
You know how much money
he would pay for this information?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.003
- How much?
- A fuckload of money, partner.

01:14:28.716 --> 01:14:33.262
- What's up, man?
- Take off your glasses.

01:14:33.387 --> 01:14:36.557
Take off your glasses
so I can see your eyes.

01:14:45.691 --> 01:14:49.612
We're going to keep
our mouths shut.

01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:54.618
Okay.

01:15:02.084 --> 01:15:05.128
I think we
may have found our Mexican drug czar.

01:15:05.253 --> 01:15:08.173
General Salazar.

01:15:08.256 --> 01:15:10.801
Be nice to have somebody
to workwith down there.

01:15:12.094 --> 01:15:15.305
Does this mean you're
gonna be gone more?

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:17.641
Possibly, yeah.

01:15:19.851 --> 01:15:23.814
You might want to pencil in
a little face time with your daughter.

01:15:23.939 --> 01:15:26.650
- Barbara--
- Because I'm at the edge
of my capabilities, Robert.

01:15:26.775 --> 01:15:29.945
I think it's important
we maintain a unified front.

01:15:30.028 --> 01:15:32.155
If you start in
on the war metaphors,

01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:34.324
I'm gonna drive this car
into a telephone pole.

01:15:34.449 --> 01:15:37.994
- I am as worried as you are.
- Oh, I don't think so.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.038
"Leave me alone.
Give me some money."

01:15:40.122 --> 01:15:42.499
That's what I get
from our daughter.

01:15:42.582 --> 01:15:46.129
She has a way of shutting me out
that seems very familiar.

01:15:46.212 --> 01:15:51.175
Well, she has a way of self-medicating
that I'm sure is very familiar to you.

01:15:53.553 --> 01:15:55.555
I'm not the one who has
to have three scotches...

01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:57.557
just to walk in the house
and say hello.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.852
I have one drink before dinner
to take the edge off. It's different.

01:16:00.977 --> 01:16:05.189
-Oh, is it?
-Otherwise, I would be dying of boredom.

01:16:21.914 --> 01:16:25.752
Why don't you go in and tell
your daughter how bored you are?

01:17:22.226 --> 01:17:25.437
Caroline, open this door immediately.

01:17:25.562 --> 01:17:28.732
Who is it?
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:17:28.816 --> 01:17:31.194
- Open the goddamn door!
- One minute.

01:17:38.243 --> 01:17:40.453
Excuse me.
I have to go to bed.

01:17:43.665 --> 01:17:46.209
Oh, Jesus.

01:17:51.256 --> 01:17:53.675
You are not going anywhere, young lady.

01:17:53.758 --> 01:17:56.970
You stay right there.

01:18:02.725 --> 01:18:04.686
Where are they?

01:18:05.937 --> 01:18:07.856
Where the hell are the drugs?

01:18:07.939 --> 01:18:09.983
Where are they?

01:18:10.108 --> 01:18:12.026
Fuck you.

01:18:12.152 --> 01:18:14.112
Fuck you.

01:18:14.195 --> 01:18:18.324
I wasn't doing anything.
You're like the Gestapo.

01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:22.872
Fuck me. Fuck me.
Well, fuck you!

01:19:12.421 --> 01:19:14.632
- Javier, good to see you.
- How you doing, partner?

01:19:14.757 --> 01:19:17.886
Did you take the precautions
we discussed about being followed?

01:19:18.011 --> 01:19:20.222
- Yes, of course.
- Will you move to the middle, please?

01:19:20.347 --> 01:19:22.265
- You're not carrying a weapon?
- No.

01:19:22.349 --> 01:19:24.768
- Of course not.
- Where are you taking me?

01:19:24.851 --> 01:19:27.771
- Somewhere safe.
- Where?

01:19:27.854 --> 01:19:30.565
A place we have that we know
is protected. He's good. Let's go.

01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:32.859
- No, no. No, no, no.
- Don't worry. It's really safe.

01:19:32.943 --> 01:19:35.654
No, no, no, no, no.
This is safe. This is safe.

01:19:35.779 --> 01:19:38.240
Come on, Javier, close the door.
Everything is cool, all right?

01:19:38.365 --> 01:19:41.076
- This is safe.
- Come on.

01:19:41.201 --> 01:19:43.620
Allright.

01:19:43.703 --> 01:19:46.248
Where would you like to go?

01:19:46.331 --> 01:19:49.668
- Huh?
- Where do you want to go, Javier?

01:19:58.635 --> 01:20:03.348
I believe it's
important that we work together.

01:20:03.473 --> 01:20:07.102
Mexico and the United States.
One hand washing the other.

01:20:07.227 --> 01:20:10.106
We agree.

01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:13.192
So, maybe you can tell me
about your informants in our operations.

01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:19.449
We thought that maybe you'd have
that kind of information for us.

01:20:20.908 --> 01:20:24.954
This is a very different
proposition, my friend.

01:20:25.079 --> 01:20:28.124
We pay for that kind
of information.

01:20:28.249 --> 01:20:31.794
Is that what
you're talking about, Javier?

01:20:31.878 --> 01:20:33.963
Getting paid?

01:20:37.425 --> 01:20:39.385
You like baseball?

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:47.643
We need lights for the parks
so kids can play at night.

01:20:48.936 --> 01:20:51.355
So it's safe.

01:20:51.439 --> 01:20:54.442
So they can play baseball.

01:20:54.525 --> 01:20:57.528
So they no become--

01:20:57.612 --> 01:20:59.530
Everybody like baseball.

01:20:59.614 --> 01:21:02.618
Everybody likes parks.

01:21:02.701 --> 01:21:06.080
Listen.

01:21:06.205 --> 01:21:10.167
I believe it's important that
the United State take an interest...

01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:12.336
in Tijuana now.

01:21:14.463 --> 01:21:17.925
That's what I'm talking about,
my friends.

01:21:18.467 --> 01:21:20.511
Accountnumber...

01:21:20.636 --> 01:21:25.682
8201-4302-8091...

01:21:25.808 --> 01:21:28.018
2431.

01:21:29.812 --> 01:21:31.855
A cash advance.

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:40.405
How much can I get?

01:21:42.866 --> 01:21:44.785
That's it?

01:21:48.789 --> 01:21:50.874
You ever try the patch, man?

01:21:50.999 --> 01:21:52.919
- The what?
- The patch.

01:21:53.002 --> 01:21:56.714
- That shit doesn't work, bro.
- It worked for my cousin.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:59.717
- No shit?
- Yeah.

01:21:59.801 --> 01:22:02.387
He had to wear five or six
at a time, but it worked.

01:22:02.512 --> 01:22:04.931
- So, how's he doing now?
- Oh, he's dead.

01:22:06.391 --> 01:22:09.519
- He's dead?
- It wasn't from the patch, man.

01:22:09.602 --> 01:22:12.230
- Okay, she's coming out.
- On it.

01:22:12.355 --> 01:22:15.275
- What did he die from?
- His wife shot him.

01:22:15.358 --> 01:22:18.987
She's leaving her property.

01:22:19.112 --> 01:22:20.905
Where the hell is she going?

01:22:21.197 --> 01:22:23.116
Maybe her neighbors.

01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:26.411
No, I don't think the neighbors
are fucking with her too much
right about now.

01:22:26.536 --> 01:22:29.080
What does she have
in her hand there?

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:35.086
She seems to be headed for the van.

01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:42.469
Oh, shit.

01:22:42.552 --> 01:22:46.599
- What-- Wh-What do we do?
- I-l don't know. What do we do?

01:22:46.682 --> 01:22:48.559
- What do you think she wants, man?
- She's your girlfriend.

01:22:48.642 --> 01:22:50.644
You think she'll invite you
to her baby shower?

01:22:50.728 --> 01:22:52.646
-Just say hello. Work it.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:54.940
She's waiting outside the van.

01:22:55.065 --> 01:22:57.610
- Hello?
- Would you like some lemonade?

01:22:57.735 --> 01:23:01.781
- I was just making some.
- You want some lemonade?

01:23:01.906 --> 01:23:03.824
Sure.

01:23:03.908 --> 01:23:08.120
I knowt his is a difficult situation,
and you're only doing your jobs.

01:23:08.245 --> 01:23:11.665
I don't wish you guys
any ill will or anything like that.

01:23:11.749 --> 01:23:13.876
But I have a favor to ask you.

01:23:14.001 --> 01:23:16.128
You're asking us for a favor?

01:23:16.253 --> 01:23:18.464
Some man threatened my child.

01:23:18.589 --> 01:23:20.508
These charges have created
so much attention,

01:23:20.591 --> 01:23:24.637
it seems to be bringing
all the nutjobs out of the nutjar.

01:23:24.762 --> 01:23:27.681
Would you keep an eye out
for anything out of the ordinary?

01:23:28.849 --> 01:23:31.185
- Sure.
- Yeah, of course we will.

01:23:31.268 --> 01:23:33.813
- I'd really appreciate it.
- Sure.

01:23:33.938 --> 01:23:36.524
- Thanks.
- Thank you for the lemonade.

01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:39.027
You're welcome.

01:23:45.617 --> 01:23:49.037
I'm gonna get this analyzed
right away, bro.

01:23:51.873 --> 01:23:54.876
So, it was my birthday...

01:23:55.001 --> 01:23:57.879
and my ex-wife
was getting remarried...

01:23:57.963 --> 01:24:00.882
and I was in some church basement
telling a bunch of strangers...

01:24:00.966 --> 01:24:02.926
it was a good day because...

01:24:03.051 --> 01:24:05.387
I didn't have to eat
out of a Dumpster.

01:24:06.805 --> 01:24:09.724
That was enough to send me
out on a pretty big one.

01:24:09.808 --> 01:24:13.228
I've been thinking a lot
about the first step--

01:24:13.311 --> 01:24:17.023
that I came to believe
I was powerless over alcohol...

01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:19.192
and that my life
had become unmanageable.

01:24:19.317 --> 01:24:22.737
My disease tells me
that I don't have a disease,

01:24:22.821 --> 01:24:25.365
that it's my birthday
and I can have one little beer,

01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:29.202
one little line,
a little Valium.

01:24:29.327 --> 01:24:33.875
Six months later, I wake up
in a sober-living house in Philly.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.544
I'm from Dallas, people.

01:24:36.669 --> 01:24:40.214
It's a disease,
an allergy of the body,

01:24:40.339 --> 01:24:42.759
an obsession of the mind.

01:24:42.842 --> 01:24:45.052
So, my name is Marty,

01:24:45.178 --> 01:24:49.223
and today I'm a grateful,
recovering alcoholic.

01:24:49.348 --> 01:24:54.395
And it's a good day because I
didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.439
Thanks.

01:24:58.858 --> 01:25:01.068
Hi.

01:25:02.528 --> 01:25:07.074
I'm Caroline.
I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.746
I mean...
I don't really like to drink.

01:25:13.539 --> 01:25:18.586
For someone my age, it's a lot easier
to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.

01:25:23.217 --> 01:25:26.637
I guess I'm angry.

01:25:30.057 --> 01:25:33.602
I mean, I think I'm really angry
about a lot of stuff.

01:25:33.727 --> 01:25:37.648
I'm just... not sure what.

01:26:24.863 --> 01:26:27.198
Listen to me.
I built our house...

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:29.451
and I'm not gonna lose it.

01:26:32.370 --> 01:26:34.247
My business--

01:26:34.372 --> 01:26:39.711
that would take a lot
of private study.

01:26:45.508 --> 01:26:49.512
I suggest...
you look into the Coronel.

01:26:49.596 --> 01:26:54.350
- The painting?
- Into selling it.

01:26:54.476 --> 01:26:56.603
If you can stomach it,

01:26:56.728 --> 01:27:00.398
you should look into it.

01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:47.947
Oh, my God.

01:28:44.588 --> 01:28:47.549
Dear Judge,

01:28:47.674 --> 01:28:51.636
I recruited the best men
in Mexico for my task force.

01:28:51.721 --> 01:28:56.976
I make the selection, putting them
under a rigorous screening process.

01:28:57.059 --> 01:29:01.647
And not only physically,
but also psychologically.

01:29:01.731 --> 01:29:05.777
Judge, I'm sorry for boxes
and the paintings and things,

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:10.031
but I have been too busy
to completely settle in here.

01:29:10.156 --> 01:29:12.825
I know you've made very good progress
with the Tijuana cartel.

01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:15.161
- Congratulations, General.
- Muchas gracias.

01:29:15.286 --> 01:29:19.457
I am confident
that before the end of the year,

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:22.835
Juan Obregon is gonna
be taken into custody.

01:29:22.919 --> 01:29:27.673
But you must understand that it's
going to be a very difficult task...

01:29:27.799 --> 01:29:31.427
because of the corruption
in the police force.

01:29:31.552 --> 01:29:34.889
Hopefully, the exchange
of training methods and information...

01:29:34.972 --> 01:29:37.225
between our two countries will help.

01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:39.519
I hope so.

01:29:39.644 --> 01:29:43.481
On another note, General,
we were talking about supply.

01:29:43.564 --> 01:29:46.360
- Mm-hmm.
- What about demand?

01:29:46.485 --> 01:29:49.446
What are your policies
towards treatment of addiction?

01:29:49.571 --> 01:29:52.699
"Treatment of addiction."

01:29:52.783 --> 01:29:55.035
Addicts treat themselves.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:59.248
They overdose, and then there's
one less to worry about.

01:30:05.003 --> 01:30:09.675
What I want you to do right now
is write down five triggers...

01:30:09.758 --> 01:30:11.885
that could lead
to your relapse,

01:30:12.010 --> 01:30:14.430
that could jeopardize
your recovery.

01:30:14.513 --> 01:30:19.435
Five triggers.
Your parents, something they could say.

01:30:19.518 --> 01:30:22.396
Anything that's a trigger for you.
It varies from person to person.

01:30:22.479 --> 01:30:26.900
Some of us
have already discussed--

01:30:26.984 --> 01:30:29.069
Linda, we talked about it
the other day.

01:30:29.194 --> 01:30:31.113
I know you have trouble
with your sister,

01:30:31.196 --> 01:30:35.033
how she's always
kind of outshining you.

01:30:43.793 --> 01:30:46.629
Hey, sugarfoot,
how do you like your new home?

01:30:49.674 --> 01:30:53.636
- You got to be kidding me.
This is not what my lawyers negotiated.

01:30:53.762 --> 01:30:55.638
Please. Fuck your lawyers.

01:30:55.764 --> 01:30:58.475
You're not getting
any goddamn cappuccino or--

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:01.478
- Biscotti.
- Yeah, you ain't getting
none of that shit either.

01:31:01.603 --> 01:31:03.646
- Pick a bed.
- Stay off the phone, Eddie.

01:31:03.772 --> 01:31:05.690
No long-distance calls, all right?

01:31:05.815 --> 01:31:08.902
- Use 1-800-CRIMINAL if you do.

01:31:17.118 --> 01:31:20.121
Mr. Ayala first came
to see me in January.

01:31:20.205 --> 01:31:23.333
That would have been 1987.

01:31:23.458 --> 01:31:26.795
He wanted to rent warehouse space
along the harbor.

01:31:26.878 --> 01:31:31.008
I didn't ask too many questions.
I am a businessman also.

01:31:31.133 --> 01:31:35.679
I was the company's secretary
from 1991 to 1994.

01:31:35.805 --> 01:31:40.017
I supposedly worked for all
six companies, but they weren't--

01:31:40.142 --> 01:31:44.355
I mean, it was just an empty office
with a desk and a telephone.

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:47.399
I never sold anything
the whole time I was there.

01:31:47.525 --> 01:31:50.820
Sometimes people came in,
and they got paid.

01:31:50.903 --> 01:31:53.697
I-I don't really know
what they did.

01:31:53.823 --> 01:31:58.536
- Didn't Mr. Ayala
say where the money came from?
- No.

01:31:58.661 --> 01:32:03.707
-Did you ask where the money came from?
-No.

01:32:03.833 --> 01:32:05.876
Where do you think it came from?

01:32:06.001 --> 01:32:08.379
- Objection. Speculation.
- Sustained.

01:32:08.462 --> 01:32:10.881
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

01:32:11.006 --> 01:32:16.011
Did you feel like you were engaged
in a legitimate enterprise?

01:32:17.721 --> 01:32:20.724
No, not really.

01:32:23.478 --> 01:32:25.397
Thank you.

01:32:52.215 --> 01:32:54.926
You were followed by the police,

01:32:55.051 --> 01:32:59.848
but they won't be able
to hear us over the children.

01:33:01.933 --> 01:33:05.437
I want to use a bomb.

01:33:08.774 --> 01:33:10.776
Are you kidding?

01:33:10.901 --> 01:33:13.612
Can't you just shoot him
or something?

01:33:15.239 --> 01:33:17.450
I don't really like guns.

01:33:17.575 --> 01:33:19.952
You shoot somebody in the head
two, three times...

01:33:20.077 --> 01:33:24.749
and some pinche doctor
is trying to keep him alive.

01:33:26.793 --> 01:33:29.796
When are you gonna do it?

01:33:29.921 --> 01:33:31.798
I don't know.

01:33:34.425 --> 01:33:39.055
Eduardo Ruiz is the only
real witness against Carl.

01:33:39.138 --> 01:33:41.099
Security will be very tight.

01:33:43.434 --> 01:33:48.731
- I may not be able to get to him.
- You'll be able to get to him.

01:33:48.815 --> 01:33:52.485
If they can get to
the pope and the president,
you can certainly get to him.

01:33:54.612 --> 01:33:59.158
Careful. You're starting to sound
like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.

01:34:20.305 --> 01:34:23.684
Nobody saw her leave?

01:34:23.809 --> 01:34:26.186
Hmm.

01:34:26.311 --> 01:34:28.689
No, I understand.

01:34:28.814 --> 01:34:31.358
Okay.

01:34:34.403 --> 01:34:36.864
I gotta go.

01:34:36.989 --> 01:34:39.867
I've got to go home.

01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:42.870
Did you want me to resch--

01:34:42.995 --> 01:34:45.497
Fine.

01:34:58.887 --> 01:35:02.265
What's going on? You seem nervous.

01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:04.642
- Because of Manolo.

01:35:04.726 --> 01:35:08.062
I'm afraid he'll do something foolish
and it's going to get him killed.

01:35:08.146 --> 01:35:09.647
Why?

01:35:09.731 --> 01:35:12.692
He says he's going
to sell information to the DEA.

01:35:12.776 --> 01:35:15.862
They're going to pay him
a lot of money.

01:35:18.281 --> 01:35:21.201
What could he tell the DEA?

01:35:21.659 --> 01:35:23.328
You know...

01:35:23.411 --> 01:35:25.413
about Salazar and Madrigal.

01:35:34.714 --> 01:35:36.591
Javier.

01:35:40.095 --> 01:35:42.222
Where is he right now?

01:35:43.264 --> 01:35:47.310
I don't know.
He took his passport and left.

01:35:51.774 --> 01:35:54.110
Give me a kiss.

01:35:54.193 --> 01:35:55.277
Don't tell him that I told you.

01:35:55.402 --> 01:35:57.279
No.

01:36:27.059 --> 01:36:30.813
What you want? Pot? Rock?
Hey, what you want?

01:37:19.488 --> 01:37:22.699
- Fuck!

01:37:39.175 --> 01:37:41.719
What the fuck do you want?

01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:12.416
Yeah.

01:40:27.221 --> 01:40:30.724
It has come to our attention that
Your Honor, while in private practice,

01:40:30.850 --> 01:40:33.060
previously represented
the town of Seal Beach...

01:40:33.185 --> 01:40:36.063
in their stop-work suit against
the police department of Seal Beach.

01:40:36.188 --> 01:40:38.732
We believe this disqualifies you
from hearing this case,

01:40:38.858 --> 01:40:42.778
and we, therefore, move for a temporary
suspension until it's investigated.

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:45.030
Mr. Adler, this is
a most unusual motion.

01:40:45.156 --> 01:40:47.074
Nonetheless, Your Honor,

01:40:47.158 --> 01:40:50.411
we feel our client deserves
every fairness afforded under the law.

01:40:50.536 --> 01:40:55.541
I hope this is not in anyway designed
to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz.

01:41:00.212 --> 01:41:02.882
We will recess until 9:00 a.m.
on Monday morning,

01:41:02.965 --> 01:41:07.053
and I will see counsel
in my chambers.

01:41:23.737 --> 01:41:26.114
They are coming this way.

01:41:29.534 --> 01:41:32.204
All of them are there.

01:41:32.329 --> 01:41:35.040
They are passing me now.

01:41:40.921 --> 01:41:43.882
Boy, there's a lot of them.

01:41:43.965 --> 01:41:48.804
Listen, would you mind if we
walked back to the hotel today?

01:41:48.887 --> 01:41:51.640
- Walk back?
- Yeah.

01:41:55.602 --> 01:41:57.771
They're not getting into the car.

01:41:59.273 --> 01:42:01.609
What are they doing?

01:42:01.692 --> 01:42:03.945
They're arguing or something.

01:42:06.823 --> 01:42:09.158
It's two blocks.
I could use the fresh air.

01:42:09.283 --> 01:42:11.744
I've been stuck in that piece of shit
hotel room for two weeks.

01:42:11.828 --> 01:42:14.455
I don't give a fuck.
Let's just stop standing around.

01:42:14.539 --> 01:42:16.666
- I want to walk 'cause I want to walk,
not 'cause he wants to walk.
- Let's walk.

01:42:16.791 --> 01:42:18.709
I like that.
Okay, we'll walk.

01:42:21.671 --> 01:42:23.923
They're going past me.

01:42:27.635 --> 01:42:32.140
I-I-I do not know. I think
they're going back to the courthouse.

01:42:32.223 --> 01:42:37.228
This could be the last chance
to do this! Get out of the car
and shoot him in the head!

01:42:56.415 --> 01:42:58.375
You're a fucking big man?

01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:03.755
I'm a real fucking man. I don't fucking
deal drugs to little fucking kids, you--

01:43:07.468 --> 01:43:09.011
Fucking rat.

01:43:09.136 --> 01:43:12.097
- You think you're a badass?
- I am a badass!

01:43:14.016 --> 01:43:17.644
Move, move! Get down!

01:43:25.277 --> 01:43:27.988
- Go, go, go!
We need an ambulance.
- Go, go, go.

01:43:56.893 --> 01:43:59.646
Ray. Ray! Ray!
Wait a minute, Ray!

01:44:46.944 --> 01:44:49.321
Manolito, Manolito, Manolito.

01:44:49.697 --> 01:44:51.824
What's up, Manolo?

01:44:53.826 --> 01:44:56.454
Looks like you're waiting
for someone.

01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:58.622
I'm just looking for the waitress.

01:44:59.331 --> 01:45:01.625
I'm ready to order.
Do you want anything?

01:45:01.709 --> 01:45:04.587
A fucking salad?
Something to drink?

01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:07.631
No, no. Calm down, calm down.

01:45:07.715 --> 01:45:11.719
What are you gonna have, Manolito?

01:45:14.430 --> 01:45:16.474
A steak.

01:45:18.517 --> 01:45:20.644
Well, if you like steak...

01:45:20.770 --> 01:45:23.272
we know a much better place.

01:45:23.647 --> 01:45:26.066
You come with us.

01:45:54.387 --> 01:45:57.224
Javier had nothing to do with this.

01:45:58.558 --> 01:46:01.061
It was all my idea.

01:46:04.231 --> 01:46:06.691
Punish me, not him.

01:46:11.446 --> 01:46:13.907
Do me a favor.

01:46:17.077 --> 01:46:19.496
Don't tell Ana I died like this.

01:46:21.666 --> 01:46:25.211
Tell her it was something else.

01:46:26.587 --> 01:46:29.215
Something official.

01:46:34.428 --> 01:46:36.931
Tell her I died
doing something worthy.

01:46:40.268 --> 01:46:42.478
Forgive me, Javi.

01:46:49.944 --> 01:46:52.363
Put some muscle into it.

01:46:53.448 --> 01:46:55.491
You too, Manolo.

01:47:02.999 --> 01:47:05.376
You're done.

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:07.378
- Get out of there.
- Don't you hear?

01:47:07.462 --> 01:47:10.756
Javier, put the shovel down.

01:47:12.383 --> 01:47:15.012
Get out. Let's go.

01:47:16.513 --> 01:47:19.099
I told you it wasn't his fault.

01:47:19.183 --> 01:47:20.934
Shut up.

01:47:25.355 --> 01:47:27.524
Turn around.

01:47:43.081 --> 01:47:45.334
Let's go, Javier. It's over.

01:48:01.892 --> 01:48:05.187
Don't be alarmed, Javier.

01:48:05.313 --> 01:48:07.607
The old man works like this.

01:48:07.732 --> 01:48:10.819
We had to go
through the same thing.

01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:16.116
We had to do this
to be sure we could trust you.

01:48:16.491 --> 01:48:18.493
Now we see that we can.

01:48:18.618 --> 01:48:21.371
We are family now.

01:49:24.101 --> 01:49:26.437
Sorry about the other night.

01:49:28.397 --> 01:49:30.274
Me too.

01:51:38.489 --> 01:51:44.203
Thank you for coming down here, though I
suspect it has been a pointless journey.

01:51:44.328 --> 01:51:48.332
- Why would you say that?
- Bueno, pues, I hear these stories.

01:51:48.415 --> 01:51:51.752
Your husband in jail,
his business in chaos,

01:51:51.835 --> 01:51:54.963
various people fighting
over the scraps.

01:51:55.088 --> 01:51:58.842
My husband was a victim of an informer
in your organization, not in ours.

01:51:58.926 --> 01:52:01.553
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.

01:52:01.678 --> 01:52:04.473
Your route has been compromised.

01:52:04.598 --> 01:52:07.976
Perhaps it is time for me to deal
with other distributors in California.

01:52:08.102 --> 01:52:10.229
- I don't think you're gonna do that.
- You don't?

01:52:10.354 --> 01:52:13.065
- No.

01:52:13.190 --> 01:52:17.903
My husband was working on something
he called the Project for the Children.

01:52:18.028 --> 01:52:23.909
- Are you aware of this?
- I don't know.
Perhaps I remember something.

01:52:27.371 --> 01:52:31.918
If you want to smuggle narcotics
in Senor Espastico Jacobo,

01:52:32.043 --> 01:52:34.254
that is nothing new, Senora.

01:52:34.379 --> 01:52:38.091
No, not in.
The doll is cocaine.

01:52:38.216 --> 01:52:42.137
High impact,
pressure-molded cocaine.

01:52:44.055 --> 01:52:47.100
It's odorless,
undetectable by the dogs.

01:52:47.225 --> 01:52:50.145
- Undetectable by anyone.

01:52:50.228 --> 01:52:52.480
I don't believe you, senora.

01:53:16.671 --> 01:53:19.382
I'm six months pregnant.

01:53:19.507 --> 01:53:21.427
I won't do it.

01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:24.847
- Then we don't have a deal.
- Yeah, right.

01:53:24.930 --> 01:53:27.349
We don't have a deal.

01:53:28.517 --> 01:53:31.979
Sorry to waste your time,
Mr. Obregon.

01:53:33.606 --> 01:53:35.524
Okay.

01:53:35.608 --> 01:53:37.526
Okay, okay.

01:53:46.786 --> 01:53:50.164
- That's good coke.
- It should be. It's yours.

01:53:52.041 --> 01:53:53.918
I want our debt forgiven,

01:53:54.043 --> 01:53:58.506
I want to be the exclusive
distributor of Obregon brothers'
cocaine in the United States,

01:53:58.631 --> 01:54:03.385
and I want the principal witness against
my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

01:54:10.309 --> 01:54:13.271
Have you told the complete truth
during this interview?

01:54:15.482 --> 01:54:18.235
Yes.

01:54:19.402 --> 01:54:22.030
- Alex?
- Solid.

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:24.574
- That's good shit, Javier.
- You know, Javier,

01:54:24.658 --> 01:54:27.202
they dump those cell phones
every 24 hours.

01:54:27.285 --> 01:54:30.872
Yes, but I have
a contact at MexTel...

01:54:30.997 --> 01:54:35.210
who can get me
his new E.S.N. in 12 hours.

01:54:35.293 --> 01:54:37.254
That's good to know.

01:54:41.341 --> 01:54:44.261
So, now that you have
what you want,

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:47.556
let's talk about how
I get what I want.

01:54:47.681 --> 01:54:49.891
Oh, you don't have
to worry about that.

01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:52.727
You're not gonna have
any problems there.

01:54:52.853 --> 01:54:57.232
Yeah, but first let's talk
about what precautions you're
taking to protect yourself.

01:54:57.315 --> 01:55:01.278
You worry about getting me
what I want.

01:55:01.403 --> 01:55:03.780
I'll worry about myself.

01:55:08.453 --> 01:55:12.915
Oye, Javier,
you should feel good about this.

01:55:16.210 --> 01:55:18.629
I feel like a traitor.

01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:49.012
Helena Ayala just left Club Platinum,
the Obregon brothers' place in Tijuana.

01:56:49.138 --> 01:56:51.182
- Yeah?
- She got stopped at the border.

01:56:51.307 --> 01:56:55.728
She was clean,
and she's back in San Diego now.

01:56:55.812 --> 01:56:57.730
Okay.

01:57:07.991 --> 01:57:11.703
- Hello?
- Robert, it's Jeff Sheridan.

01:57:11.828 --> 01:57:14.038
- D-Did I wake you? I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

01:57:14.164 --> 01:57:16.207
General Salazar has been arrested.

01:57:16.332 --> 01:57:18.751
It turns out he has been working
for Porfirio Madrigal...

01:57:18.835 --> 01:57:20.879
and the Juarez cartel
the entire time.

01:57:21.004 --> 01:57:24.215
That is why he was trying to push
the Obregons out of Tijuana...

01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:26.551
- so he and Madrigal could move in.
- What?

01:57:26.676 --> 01:57:29.679
I thought Madrigal was dead.
I thought that had been verified.

01:57:29.762 --> 01:57:33.057
Apparently not. It is a shitstorm here,

01:57:33.183 --> 01:57:37.228
but the D.E.A. supplied the information
and was part of the sting.

01:57:37.353 --> 01:57:40.774
So, maybe we can spin this a little,
but I don't know what to tell people.

01:57:40.857 --> 01:57:44.069
-So, when are you coming back?
-I'll try to get there as soon as I can.

01:57:44.195 --> 01:57:46.405
- Yeah, okay, but--
- Robert.

01:57:46.530 --> 01:57:50.951
Robert? Robert?

01:57:51.035 --> 01:57:53.245
I gotta call you back.

01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:55.289
- What--

01:57:59.877 --> 01:58:04.924
- My Leica's missing.
- She got the video camera too.

01:58:05.049 --> 01:58:08.093
At least we know she's still alive.
Where are you going?

01:58:08.219 --> 01:58:12.264
Pawn shops open in an hour. Ten minutes
after that, she'll be at her dealer.

01:58:12.389 --> 01:58:15.935
If I can find him,
I should be able to find her.

01:58:25.653 --> 01:58:29.782
Although
ser and estar both mean "to be,"

01:58:29.907 --> 01:58:33.786
they have very specific uses.

01:58:33.869 --> 01:58:36.832
May I help you, sir?

01:58:41.670 --> 01:58:43.463
Excuse me!

01:58:43.588 --> 01:58:47.008
Seth has to be excused.
He's going on a field trip.

01:58:53.098 --> 01:58:56.810
I can't believe you brought
my daughter to this place.

01:58:58.603 --> 01:59:03.316
Whoa, whoa. Why don't you just
back the fuck up, man?

01:59:03.442 --> 01:59:05.485
"To this place"?

01:59:05.610 --> 01:59:07.821
What is that shit?

01:59:07.946 --> 01:59:10.866
Okay, right now, all over
this great nation of ours,

01:59:10.949 --> 01:59:13.660
100,000 white people from the suburbs
are cruising around downtown...

01:59:13.785 --> 01:59:17.497
asking every black person,
"You got any drugs? You know
where I can score some drugs?"

01:59:17.622 --> 01:59:21.543
Think about the effect that has
on the psyche of a black person,
on their possibilities.

01:59:21.626 --> 01:59:25.672
I-- God, I guarantee you,
you bring 100,000 black people
into your neighborhood,

01:59:25.755 --> 01:59:30.011
and they're asking every white
person, "You got any drugs?
Know where I can score some?"

01:59:30.136 --> 01:59:34.348
Within a day, everyone would be
selling--your friends, their kids.

01:59:34.474 --> 01:59:38.186
Here's why: It's an unbeatable market
force, man. It's a 300% markup value.

01:59:38.311 --> 01:59:41.147
You can go out on the street
and make $500 in two hours,

01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:43.232
come back and do whatever you want
with the rest of your day.

01:59:43.316 --> 01:59:47.904
You're telling me that white people
would still be going to law school?

02:00:12.678 --> 02:00:15.890
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

02:00:15.973 --> 02:00:17.892
Caroline.

02:00:17.975 --> 02:00:20.437
She's been here.

02:00:20.521 --> 02:00:22.564
This is a business, man.
Why don't you get the fuck out ofhere?

02:00:22.689 --> 02:00:26.610
I need to find my daughter, all right?
I'll pay you.

02:00:27.694 --> 02:00:30.906
All right.
Okay. Hold on.

02:00:34.034 --> 02:00:38.247
Who in the fuck do you think you are?
Where the fuck do you think you are?

02:00:38.372 --> 02:00:43.418
- Why the fuck shouldn't I just
put your ass in a Dumpster?
- I got money.

02:00:43.544 --> 02:00:46.088
- I got money!
- I got $1,000 in my wallet.

02:00:46.213 --> 02:00:50.259
- It's for you.
- If I want your money, man,
I will take your money.

02:00:52.553 --> 02:00:55.097
Just tell me
where my daughter is.

02:00:55.222 --> 02:00:57.683
Please? Please?

02:01:03.230 --> 02:01:05.441
Don't do that shit again.

02:01:11.906 --> 02:01:16.619
Look, Jesus, man, I'm telling you,
don't do this vigilante thing.

02:01:16.744 --> 02:01:19.789
Either the cops are gonna find her,
or she's gonna call you.

02:01:19.914 --> 02:01:21.833
Okay?

02:01:21.916 --> 02:01:23.835
I promise.

02:01:52.238 --> 02:01:54.157
Ana.

02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:58.536
If Manolo hadn't done what he did...

02:01:59.454 --> 02:02:03.833
they wouldn't have been able
to get Salazar and Madrigal.

02:02:08.422 --> 02:02:11.008
He did something really good.

02:02:14.053 --> 02:02:17.932
What's more, he did
something important for Tijuana.

02:02:19.475 --> 02:02:21.894
I would like to believe you.

02:02:29.527 --> 02:02:32.988
You don't have to believe me...

02:02:35.116 --> 02:02:37.243
because it's the truth.

02:02:38.494 --> 02:02:40.913
The simple truth.

02:02:57.180 --> 02:02:59.891
Tomorrow I'm going
to burn his clothes.

02:03:47.731 --> 02:03:50.902
I know she's in there.
Just let me talk to her.

02:03:50.985 --> 02:03:53.780
Look, I know she's in there, man!

02:03:53.905 --> 02:03:56.449
No, I fucking know she's in there!

02:04:00.244 --> 02:04:02.413
Jesus Christ!

02:04:02.497 --> 02:04:05.166
I-I haven't touched her.

02:04:11.088 --> 02:04:14.300
You get the fuck
out of here right now.

02:04:27.271 --> 02:04:29.190
Hi.

02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:37.990
Hi, Daddy.

02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:43.330
Hi, sweetheart.

02:05:16.822 --> 02:05:20.033
Hey, good morning, Eddie.

02:05:20.159 --> 02:05:22.202
- Good morning.
- Big day.

02:05:23.662 --> 02:05:28.208
You're a star.

02:05:28.333 --> 02:05:30.752
Why don't you go take a shower, man?
You smell.

02:05:32.838 --> 02:05:36.509
- Who is it?
- It's the Mafia.

02:05:36.593 --> 02:05:39.929
- I've got his breakfast.
- Coming.

02:05:43.683 --> 02:05:45.602
- So who's this going to?
- Over here.

02:05:53.359 --> 02:05:56.321
- Ooh.
- Fuck off.

02:05:56.446 --> 02:06:00.658
- Relax, Eddie.
- Yeah, where has the love gone?
Good-bye.

02:06:02.535 --> 02:06:04.579
You know, you're gonna be testifying
for about ten days.

02:06:04.704 --> 02:06:06.915
We could just decide
to stop feeding your ass.

02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:10.960
You expect me to be grateful
for spending the rest of my life
looking over my shoulder?

02:06:11.044 --> 02:06:14.756
Wow, that's--
that's heavy, Eddie.

02:06:17.550 --> 02:06:21.262
Can't you for one second imagine
that none of this had happened,
that my drugs had gone through?

02:06:21.387 --> 02:06:23.306
What would be the harm?

02:06:23.389 --> 02:06:25.600
Huh? What would be the harm?

02:06:25.725 --> 02:06:28.437
A few people get high
who are getting high anyway.

02:06:28.562 --> 02:06:31.607
Your partner's still alive.

02:06:31.732 --> 02:06:35.152
We don't have to have
breakfast together.

02:06:35.236 --> 02:06:37.279
Don't you see this means nothing?

02:06:37.404 --> 02:06:39.615
Your whole life is pointless.

02:06:40.908 --> 02:06:43.327
You're really breaking my heart.

02:06:45.246 --> 02:06:50.793
- The worst part about you, Monty--
- "Monty"?

02:06:50.918 --> 02:06:52.837
The worst part about you, Monty,

02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:56.257
is you realize the futility of what
you're doing, and you do it anyway.

02:06:56.340 --> 02:06:59.135
Wish you could see
how transparent you are.

02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:01.387
This food tastes like shit.

02:07:01.512 --> 02:07:05.307
So, take your stank ass
and go get a shower already.

02:07:07.268 --> 02:07:09.186
Let me tell you something.

02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:12.189
You only got to me because you
were tipped off by the Juarez cartel...

02:07:12.273 --> 02:07:14.191
who's trying to break into Tijuana.

02:07:14.275 --> 02:07:17.695
- You are helping them. Uh-huh.
- Mmm.

02:07:17.778 --> 02:07:20.824
So, remember, you work
for a drug dealer too, Monty.

02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:24.202
- Fuck me.

02:07:24.286 --> 02:07:27.205
- Who is it?
- Breakfast.

02:07:29.791 --> 02:07:31.710
Hurry up.
It's getting cold.

02:07:36.423 --> 02:07:38.341
Okay. One second.

02:07:39.593 --> 02:07:42.179
- Get the fuck down!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:07:42.262 --> 02:07:45.849
- Get down! Get the fuck down!
- Hey, hey, I'm on your side!

02:07:45.932 --> 02:07:49.102
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit. Call an ambulance.

02:07:49.227 --> 02:07:52.189
- Call an ambulance! Fuck!
- Palms up.
Spread your damn hands out.

02:07:52.314 --> 02:07:55.358
- Shit! Eddie!

02:07:57.903 --> 02:07:59.988
Hold on.

02:08:00.071 --> 02:08:03.283
Oh, shit!
Hurry up with that ambulance!

02:08:03.408 --> 02:08:06.036
Shit. Hold on. Hold on.

02:08:08.830 --> 02:08:12.543
Your Honor, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

02:08:12.668 --> 02:08:16.589
because of the sudden death
of Eduardo Ruiz,

02:08:16.672 --> 02:08:20.968
the people have determined
that we cannot continue our case
against Carl Ayala.

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:26.432
Oh! Oh!

02:08:28.935 --> 02:08:31.229
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

02:10:16.628 --> 02:10:19.130
- Yeah?

02:10:19.214 --> 02:10:21.216
Hi.

02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:25.720
I got a copy of your speech.

02:10:25.804 --> 02:10:28.515
It's fantastic.

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:31.184
So, Robert, my genuine thanks.

02:10:31.309 --> 02:10:33.436
You're my choice.
You're gonna be great.

02:10:33.561 --> 02:10:36.356
The president's sorry he hasn't been
able to spend more time with you.

02:10:36.481 --> 02:10:40.026
After the press conference,
he wants to really sit down.

02:10:40.151 --> 02:10:44.364
Oh, and I got to the Post too.

02:10:44.489 --> 02:10:47.200
Don't worry about that thing
with your daughter. It's not news.

02:10:47.325 --> 02:10:51.539
They're willing to treat it
as a family matter, personal matter.

02:10:51.664 --> 02:10:55.584
Anyway, if it came out,
we could turn it into a qualification.

02:10:55.668 --> 02:10:57.711
"I've been in the trenches
of the drug war.

02:10:57.837 --> 02:11:00.756
I've seen the face of the enemy.
Etcetera, etcetera. "

02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:05.678
A sterling reputation
and close friend of the president,

02:11:05.761 --> 02:11:09.390
recently confirmed into the Office
of National Drug Control Policy,

02:11:09.515 --> 02:11:14.228
our new drug czar,
Robert Hudson Wakefield.

02:11:24.697 --> 02:11:28.242
The war on drugs is a war
that we have to win,

02:11:28.367 --> 02:11:31.412
and a war that we can win.

02:11:31.495 --> 02:11:37.251
We have to win this war to save
our country's most precious resource--

02:11:37.376 --> 02:11:40.087
our children.

02:11:40.171 --> 02:11:44.634
Sixty-eight million children
have been targeted...

02:11:44.718 --> 02:11:47.762
by those who perpetrate this war...

02:11:49.222 --> 02:11:54.186
and protecting these children
must be priority number one.

02:11:57.898 --> 02:12:03.445
There has been progress,
and there has been failure.

02:12:03.570 --> 02:12:06.907
But where we have fallen short,

02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:10.452
I see not a problem,

02:12:10.577 --> 02:12:14.331
I see an opportunity.

02:12:17.751 --> 02:12:20.796
An opportunity...

02:12:20.921 --> 02:12:26.593
to correct the mistakes...
ofthe past...

02:12:26.676 --> 02:12:31.139
while laying a foundation
for the future.

02:12:36.771 --> 02:12:39.190
This takes...

02:12:39.273 --> 02:12:42.985
not only new ideas...

02:12:43.110 --> 02:12:46.030
but perseverance.

02:12:46.113 --> 02:12:51.911
This takes not only...
resources, but courage.

02:12:52.036 --> 02:12:53.996
This takes...

02:12:54.122 --> 02:12:57.333
not only... government,

02:12:57.458 --> 02:13:00.002
but families.

02:13:01.963 --> 02:13:04.006
I've laid out a--

02:13:07.426 --> 02:13:11.389
I've laid out
a ten-point plan that--

02:13:26.488 --> 02:13:28.407
I can't do this.

02:13:31.827 --> 02:13:35.873
If there is a war on drugs,

02:13:35.998 --> 02:13:40.043
then many of our family members
are the enemy.

02:13:43.505 --> 02:13:48.719
And I don't know how you wage war
on your own family.

02:14:31.888 --> 02:14:34.599
National Airport, please.

02:15:19.854 --> 02:15:23.983
Hey, Arnie, it's Saturday.
You're working too hard, my friend.

02:15:24.066 --> 02:15:27.319
Carl, I'm running late.
I'm coming right over.

02:15:27.403 --> 02:15:32.366
No, no, no, don't bother, Arnie.
Let me ask you something.

02:15:32.449 --> 02:15:35.369
When were you gonna tell me
about the $3 million...

02:15:35.453 --> 02:15:39.915
we got in from San Francisco
two days after I was arrested?

02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:43.961
Um... I was waiting
for the right time.

02:15:44.086 --> 02:15:47.339
Oh. You didn't think you could trust
my wife with that information?

02:15:47.465 --> 02:15:49.508
I didn't want to risk it.

02:15:49.633 --> 02:15:52.178
That could have been frozen
along with everything else.

02:15:52.261 --> 02:15:54.513
You had it all figured out,
didn'tyou?

02:15:54.638 --> 02:15:56.557
You were gonna move into my house,

02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:00.186
raise my kids, sleep in my bed...

02:16:00.311 --> 02:16:02.521
with my wife.

02:16:02.646 --> 02:16:04.900
Sounds like a nice plan.

02:16:05.025 --> 02:16:06.985
Oh, is it insane?

02:16:07.068 --> 02:16:09.696
Just think about it, okay?
If I was gonna rip you off,

02:16:09.821 --> 02:16:12.032
why wouldn't I just leave town
after Ruiz was killed?

02:16:12.157 --> 02:16:15.327
Why would I sit next to you
in court and listen to a dismissal?

02:16:15.410 --> 02:16:19.706
Let me ask you something.
You think there's a difference
between a reason and an excuse?

02:16:19.831 --> 02:16:22.375
'Cause I don't.

02:16:22.501 --> 02:16:25.796
- Good-bye, Arnie.
- Carl--

02:16:25.921 --> 02:16:27.881
Carl?

02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:37.891
Come on, sweetheart.

02:16:38.016 --> 02:16:41.061
Come outside.
Everyone's waiting for you.

02:16:41.186 --> 02:16:43.605
- Who was that?
- Arnie. He's, uh--

02:16:43.688 --> 02:16:45.898
- He can't make it to the barbecue.
- Oh.

02:16:46.023 --> 02:16:48.567
- Come on.
- Hi, Helena.

02:16:50.236 --> 02:16:52.155
- Hello.
- It's a great party.

02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:54.574
- Who is he, a friend of yours?
- Oh, I'm a nobody.

02:16:54.699 --> 02:16:57.245
I'm the nobody who arrested you.

02:16:57.370 --> 02:16:59.789
- You're--
- How you doing?

02:16:59.871 --> 02:17:02.290
- What are you doing in my house?
- Oh, just looking around.

02:17:02.375 --> 02:17:05.795
You got nice shit. Drug money
buys a lot of nice shit, Carl.

02:17:05.878 --> 02:17:08.214
Listen, you don't want to talk
that way in my house.

02:17:08.297 --> 02:17:10.424
You're fucking a murderer, Carl.

02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:12.968
- Fuck you and fuck your wife.
- Hey, you can't be in here.

02:17:13.052 --> 02:17:16.472
- Get him out.
- You put me out, Carl.

02:17:16.556 --> 02:17:18.558
- I'm a cop.
- I don't care.

02:17:18.641 --> 02:17:21.936
- Get out.
- Hey! Hey, hey!

02:17:28.692 --> 02:17:32.612
- Is that what you wanted?
- A nice little bedtime story, Helena.

02:17:32.697 --> 02:17:34.781
Tell him how you murdered
my partner!

02:17:34.906 --> 02:17:37.450
- You got the wrong--
- His name was Ray Castro, Helena!

02:17:37.576 --> 02:17:40.788
Ray Castro!
You remember that!

02:17:40.871 --> 02:17:43.124
- What's his problem?
- The carpet, sweetheart.

02:17:43.249 --> 02:17:45.168
- No, no, no, I got it.
- I got it.

02:17:48.254 --> 02:17:50.299
- Where did he come from?
- Outside, honey.

02:17:57.097 --> 02:17:59.016
What do you want to do, man?

02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:32.549
On the good days, I feel like I get it.

02:18:32.633 --> 02:18:36.553
Like it all makes sense.

02:18:36.637 --> 02:18:38.972
I can stay in the moment.

02:18:39.056 --> 02:18:43.852
I don't have to control
everything in the future...

02:18:43.977 --> 02:18:49.691
and I believe everything
is gonna work out fine.

02:18:52.986 --> 02:18:54.906
O-On the bad days,

02:18:56.657 --> 02:19:00.870
I just want to grab the phone
and start dialing numbers.

02:19:00.995 --> 02:19:04.707
I want to pull my hair...

02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:09.045
and run through
the streets screaming.

02:19:13.508 --> 02:19:18.555
But thanks to the people
I've met in these rooms,

02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:22.892
like Margaret and Jim...

02:19:23.017 --> 02:19:25.937
and Sarah,

02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:28.565
um...

02:19:28.690 --> 02:19:31.109
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna make it...

02:19:31.191 --> 02:19:33.236
through today.

02:19:44.707 --> 02:19:47.251
Would you like to share?

02:19:48.544 --> 02:19:52.089
Uh... my name is Robert.

02:19:52.214 --> 02:19:55.134
My wife Barbara and I...

02:19:55.217 --> 02:19:59.096
are here to support
our daughter, Caroline,

02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:02.141
and we're hear to listen.
