00:01.752 --> 00:03.754
Hey, how you been?

00:04.088 --> 00:05.631
Forget what happened last week?

00:05.715 --> 00:06.924
I'm not surprised,

00:07.008 --> 00:09.343
with some of that cheap-ass
ganj you've been smoking.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.807
Try some of this good
Canadian shit.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.392
- Little help here!
- Put me down, put me down.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.019
No more. Ah!

00:18.436 --> 00:19.937
<i>- What happened?
- He busted his leg.</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:21.313
- Oh, fuck.
- Is that bone?

00:21.397 --> 00:23.024
Took six plates
and 18 screws,

00:23.107 --> 00:25.526
but I think we got Humpty Dumpty
put back together again.

00:25.609 --> 00:26.861
Drugs.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.029
I went to get a test done,

00:28.112 --> 00:30.489
to find out if I inherited
a genetic mutation from my mom

00:30.573 --> 00:32.575
that means I'm probably gonna
die of breast cancer.

00:32.658 --> 00:33.701
And?

00:33.784 --> 00:35.411
I don't find out the results
for a couple days.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.830
- Liam?
- Liam, you home?

00:39.165 --> 00:40.166
You gonna answer?

00:40.249 --> 00:42.293
It took 'em two days
to realize I was gone.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.669
They can't be too worried.

00:43.753 --> 00:44.795
I think we should break up.

00:44.879 --> 00:47.298
Call me when
you're not so needy.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.924
<i>Why the long face,
little pirate?</i>

00:49.008 --> 00:50.134
<i>I didn't make it
past the first round</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:51.594
<i>of cuts for West Point,</i>

00:51.677 --> 00:53.929
<i>and my lesbian sister's
in love with my girlfriend</i>

00:54.013 --> 00:55.139
<i>trying to turn her gay too.</i>

00:56.307 --> 00:58.059
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.727
I'm not gay.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.645
<i>She doesn't love me.</i>

01:01.729 --> 01:03.856
<i>Kelly's a bitch.
She likes to break hearts.</i>

01:03.939 --> 01:05.316
We should go fuck her up.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.155
Kev?

01:11.238 --> 01:12.907
- Did you just...?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.826
Eight seconds.
Twelve-year-olds last longer.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.787
Have you been sending
two children to our school

01:17.870 --> 01:19.330
for the price of one
for months?

01:19.413 --> 01:20.498
We're very sorry, Sister.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.832
We need a Jesus

01:21.916 --> 01:24.335
for the Festival of St. Felicity
pageant next weekend.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.003
<i>You want Kev to be Jesus?</i>

01:26.796 --> 01:29.632
I saw the "Help Wanted" sign.
I need a job.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.676
- Holy fuck.
- Hi, Max.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.886
Uh, listen.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.221

01:35.304 --> 01:36.305

01:36.388 --> 01:37.389
how much
you have in the partnership.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.517
- A hundred.
- What if I bought you out now?

01:39.600 --> 01:40.810

We'll get it done.

could take six months?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.428
- Six months?
- Yeah.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.014
This morning he asked me
to give him a sponge bath.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.307
What was that like?

07:53.390 --> 07:54.391
Well, I didn't do it.

Oh, and there's
a massive dump

08:05.402 --> 08:07.029
waiting down there
in his bedpan.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.113

08:08.197 --> 08:09.656
Uh-huh.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.826
Well, we could get him
adult diapers, right?

08:12.910 --> 08:14.786

wiping the shit

08:14.870 --> 08:17.080

- Ugh!

- Oh, Christ, what's that smell?
- Ugh.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.107
Yes.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.400
Oxy!

08:45.484 --> 08:46.735
Not for another half hour,
Frank.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.779
I need it now.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.281
If you take too much Oxy,
it's gonna make you constipated.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.283
That hasn't happened yet.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.411
Nice.
What did he eat?

08:56.787 --> 08:59.122
Okay, last one
for eight hours, Frank.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.207
You better enjoy it.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.750
Then two, gimme two.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.293
Nope,
you're only allowed one.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.420
Two!
I won't make it on one!

09:05.504 --> 09:06.630
Sorry, Frank.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.173
So, Frank...

09:08.257 --> 09:09.466
Any ideas?

09:09.550 --> 09:11.176
It's not like we
have that many options.

09:11.260 --> 09:14.179
We can't, like, drug him
and dump him under a bridge.

09:14.263 --> 09:15.556
- Why not?
- We could do real time.

09:15.639 --> 09:16.723
Elder abuse.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.600
Nah, no jury would convict.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.269
We could get him
back on disability.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.604
You know, get the state
to hire somebody to help him.

09:22.688 --> 09:23.564
That could take months.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.440

09:28.860 --> 09:30.779
- About your sorry ass!
- Hey, wait.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.948
Doesn't he still have money
from that Randy guy?

09:33.031 --> 09:34.825
- Who?
- Ingrid's ex.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.951
He paid Frank
to stay away from her.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.578
No Randy money left.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.830
You couldn't have
possibly spent it already.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.123
All gone, no money.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.249
What about the

09:42.332 --> 09:43.667
cash that he made
on that drug deal?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.502
It's my rainy day fund.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.754
Yeah, and this is a

09:47.838 --> 09:49.381

and, uh,

09:49.464 --> 09:51.717
see how much a home
healthcare worker costs.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.884
I got it.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.094
Oh, I don't mind.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.637
No worries,
I'm on it.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.681
Don't need no
healthcare worker.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.974
Yes, you do.

09:59.057 --> 10:02.311
Times like these were
made for families,

10:02.394 --> 10:05.564
caring for loved ones
in their time of need.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.608
Nobody loves you, Frank.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.068
Hey, um, anybody see
Liam last night?

10:10.152 --> 10:12.946
Yeah, he was watching TV
on the sofa with Frank.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.781
- He sleep here?
- I think so.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.408
I didn't tuck him in
or anything.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.660
Here's your bedpan.

10:18.744 --> 10:19.828
Hey.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.413
Catch a meeting later?

10:22.247 --> 10:24.082
I think I'm gonna do an
Al-Anon meeting again today.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.209
Yeah, well, let us know
if you think it's worthwhile.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.878
We could turn it
into a fun-filled activity

10:27.961 --> 10:29.379
for the whole family.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.050
Carl, you want me
to make you some eggs?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.886
Thanks, but I have coffee
and cereal in the morning.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.721
Debbie, scrambled eggs?

10:37.804 --> 10:39.014
Coffee for me.

10:40.849 --> 10:41.892
Excuse me.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.604
Kelly again?

10:46.188 --> 10:48.690
Yup.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.694
So, what are your plans?

10:53.403 --> 10:54.780
Uh, well...

10:54.863 --> 10:56.865
I'm gonna go to that
Al-Anon meeting.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.950
No, not today.
For the future.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.954
I...

11:03.038 --> 11:05.165
I don't really know. I haven't
really thought about it.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.249
Franny needs a real bed.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.668
She's too big for her crib now,

11:07.751 --> 11:09.920
and my room doesn't have
enough space for two beds.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.880
So, I was thinking that
you could take my room,

11:11.963 --> 11:14.299
and Franny and I
could take your old room.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.885
Sure.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.429
Well, I'm gonna go
wake up Franny.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.514
Keep her up there too long,

11:20.597 --> 11:21.807
she won't be able
to sleep at night.

11:30.816 --> 11:33.443
<i>♪♪ Now there was a time ♪♪</i>

11:34.486 --> 11:35.487
Kev.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.114
<i>♪♪ When you loved me so ♪♪</i>

11:37.197 --> 11:38.198
Kevin.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.618
Yeah?

11:41.702 --> 11:42.786
You still haven't?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.038
Nope, how long?

11:45.122 --> 11:47.666
- 47 minutes.
- Oh, baby.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.460
- This is so fantastic.
- Oh, yeah.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.212
It's wonderful, baby.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.215
And I am so
happy for you, baby.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.134
Oh, happy, happy.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.218
Mmm.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.554
But all good things

12:00.637 --> 12:02.055
<i>♪♪ Can't wait till you see ♪♪</i>

12:02.139 --> 12:03.890
Come to an end,
now, Kevin.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.434
You don't wanna try
for 60 minutes?

12:05.517 --> 12:06.810
Nope. Now.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.897
- Do that thing with my balls.
- Mm.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.357
Okay.

12:12.858 --> 12:13.692
This?

12:13.775 --> 12:15.277
No, no, no.
The other thing.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.361
- This?
- Yes.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.947
Yes.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.198
Yes.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.077
<i>♪♪ How you like me now ♪♪</i>

12:28.665 --> 12:30.083

<i>♪♪ Make you love me baby ♪♪</i>

12:39.009 --> 12:41.178
Fuck you, Mr. Vasectomy.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.138
I'm a man again.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.112
Hey. You working today?

12:59.196 --> 13:00.447
Yeah.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.823
Sorry about West Point.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.617
Oh, it's no big deal.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.702
I mean, it was stupid
for me to even apply.

13:05.786 --> 13:06.953
I don't know
what I was thinking.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.830
They're never gonna accept
someone like me.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.333
It's their loss.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.709
Yeah. Fuck 'em, right?

13:13.543 --> 13:15.420
I gotta get to work.
Can't be late.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.172
Who's gonna fry those
fish sticks?

13:28.058 --> 13:31.061
- Ay, Jesus!
- Ugh.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.730
<i>This is nasty.</i>

13:34.356 --> 13:36.441
Any of those beers have
something left in 'em?

13:37.692 --> 13:39.277
No.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.779
Any left in the fridge?

13:40.862 --> 13:42.572
Let me finish this first.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.407
Ooh.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.495
Called a couple home
healthcare worker places.

13:48.578 --> 13:51.248
22 bucks an hour.
30 for overnights.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.582
Totally unnecessary.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.835
Just set me up in here
with my Oxys,

13:54.918 --> 13:56.461
a couple of brews,
and the remote,

13:56.545 --> 13:57.838
and I'm good as gold.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.382
Yeah, you're down here
yelling for us day and night.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.217
Totally need someone
to take care of you.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.718
Easy!

14:03.802 --> 14:05.011
I'm not even supposed
to be doing this.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.805
It's Liam's shift.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.932
Well, then get him down here.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.225
Liam!

14:10.308 --> 14:11.518
He's not here,

14:11.601 --> 14:13.687
and I haven't told anyone
where I hid your Oxy.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.565
So don't think you can bully
Liam into giving you more.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.946
What happened
to that G.I. Jane chick

14:23.029 --> 14:24.114
your brother was banging?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.407
The one you were
trying to steal?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.409
I wasn't trying to steal her.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.785
Sure you were.
You were following her

14:28.869 --> 14:31.079
around like a love-sick puppy.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.164
She broke up with Carl.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.249
So...

14:34.332 --> 14:36.251
she is a carpet-muncher?

14:36.334 --> 14:37.669
Don't be an asshole, Frank.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.129
She was cute.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.256
Smart, too.

14:41.339 --> 14:44.676
I was surprised
she went for a moron like Carl.

14:44.759 --> 14:48.263
He was definitely punching
above his weight on that one.

14:48.346 --> 14:49.598
Kelly isn't gay.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.975
Softball, really?

14:53.643 --> 14:54.895
Bi?

14:55.937 --> 14:59.357
Or maybe you just
weren't tempting enough

14:59.441 --> 15:03.570
for her to risk jumping into
gender experimentation.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.031
Women like smart.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.115
Sorry, sweetheart.

15:07.198 --> 15:09.868
You're not the sharpest
shovel in the shed.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.246
Now, I bet if it had been
your sister, Fiona,

15:13.330 --> 15:14.789
she's not br--hey!

15:14.873 --> 15:17.250
She's not brilliant like Lip,

15:17.334 --> 15:19.586
but she's street smart, quick.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.421
I bet if it had been Fiona,

15:21.504 --> 15:24.507
softball girl would have
taken that for a spin.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.592
Keep it up, Frank.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.385
You'll never see an Oxy again.

15:28.637 --> 15:31.640
Not to mention,
Fiona got Monica's

15:31.723 --> 15:35.060
stripper-on-a-bender
dangerous looks,

15:35.143 --> 15:38.021
not that it's made
Fiona's life easier.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.273
Too much pretty
can really mess you up.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.650
<i>Hi, it's Liam.</i>

15:41.733 --> 15:43.610
- Liam, where are you?
- Better to be like you.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.695
Frank is driving me fucking
crazy and it's your shift.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.364
- Kinda slow.
- Love you, bye.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.659
Keeps you realistic
about your prospects.

16:02.504 --> 16:03.672
Morning.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.298
I'm not late, am I?

16:05.382 --> 16:06.549
He's here.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.842
Who's here?

16:07.926 --> 16:10.095
The captain.
He wants to meet you.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.388
Captain Bob?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.015
I thought he was made up,
like Colonel Sanders.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.850
Colonel Sanders was real.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.102
He was?

16:18.770 --> 16:20.105
Follow me.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.901
Sir.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.611
Ensign Gallagher.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.446
Best fryer mate I ever had.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.157
Pleasure to meet you, Carl.
Have a seat.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.620
- You want a root beer float?
- Uh, no--

16:35.704 --> 16:37.038
Laurie, bring our own
little white panther

16:37.122 --> 16:38.707
- here a root beer float.
- Okay.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.041
- You want some popcorn shrimp?
- No--

16:40.125 --> 16:43.003
- Laurie, popcorn shrimp too.
- Right.

16:43.545 --> 16:46.172
I eat a basket at every
location I visit, Carl.

16:46.798 --> 16:49.259
Quality control is the
name of the shrimp game.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.760
Just look at that.

16:50.844 --> 16:54.264
Nicely battered,
properly crisp.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.767
Mm, mm, mm.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.479
You really saved my ass
the other day, son.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.189
Once word get out
you can rob a franchise,

17:03.273 --> 17:05.066
the sharks descend.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.361
You given much thought
to your future, Carl?

17:08.445 --> 17:09.446
Um, well--

17:09.529 --> 17:10.572
Look, I know,
a young man like you,

17:10.655 --> 17:12.365
it's hard to see
yourself down the road.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.659
But Captain Bob's is growing.

17:14.743 --> 17:16.286
Carl, you own a Winnebago?

17:16.369 --> 17:18.329
- No.
- I do, a Grand Tour.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.247
You got a lake house?

17:19.539 --> 17:20.790
- Mm-mm.
- I do.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.543
Ski boat?
Two brand-new Cadillacs?

17:23.626 --> 17:25.336
You take a two-week
vacation every year

17:25.420 --> 17:26.880
down the Alabama coast?

17:26.963 --> 17:28.089
No, sir.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.340
Well, you're damn straight,
you don't.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.385
But you will, Carl, if you
make the right choice today.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.764
I got a store in
East Garfield Park,

17:35.847 --> 17:37.932
and it's been robbed
six times this month.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.017
You could start tomorrow.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.186
Assistant Manager,
500 bucks a week.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.688
In a year,
you could be manager.

17:43.772 --> 17:44.981
Hell, in ten years,

17:45.065 --> 17:46.983
you can even own
your own franchise.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.068
Huh?

17:48.151 --> 17:49.778
The sky is the limit, son.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.738
Carl, play your cards right,

17:52.197 --> 17:54.282
you could even end up
with your own Winnebago.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.954
So, mystery solved.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.664
Yeah, what mystery's that?

18:01.748 --> 18:04.209
Homer.
He's not drunk somewhere.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.543
Yeah, what happened?

18:05.627 --> 18:07.212
He violated his parole.

18:07.295 --> 18:10.423
Idiot got pulled over
with a.45 under his seat.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.094
Shit, I gotta try and find
a new mechanic.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.388
It might be time to take the
broom out of Jason's hands.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.724
You mean instead of hiring
someone who's qualified,

18:19.808 --> 18:21.893
I should hire the kid
who sweeps up?

18:23.186 --> 18:24.187
Yeah.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.606
All right, Mother Teresa.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.441
Show him how to change
a spark plug

18:28.525 --> 18:29.943
while I try to find someone

18:30.026 --> 18:31.402
who actually knows
what the hell they're doing.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.571
- Hey, thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.116
Yo, Jason!

18:36.574 --> 18:37.742
Hey, come here, man.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.830
Man, you ever change
an air filter?

18:42.247 --> 18:43.248
I've seen you do it.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.042
All right, I want you to finish
detailing the Bagger over there,

18:46.126 --> 18:47.710
then get an air filter
for the Sportster.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.878
All right?
I'll come over there

18:48.962 --> 18:50.213
and I'll teach you
how to change it.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.548
Yeah, all right.

18:55.677 --> 18:56.678
Lip.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.430
Hey, what's up?

19:00.348 --> 19:01.850
Doctor's office called.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.601
They want me
to call 'em back at noon,

19:03.685 --> 19:05.979
uh, go over the result
of my test with them.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.438
What time is it now?

19:08.106 --> 19:09.274
Five of.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.442
I just thought I should, uh,
be with someone

19:11.526 --> 19:12.569
in case I try
to jump off a roof

19:12.652 --> 19:13.695
- or throw myself in front
- Yeah, yeah.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.196
- a bus or something.
- Of course, yeah.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.866
Hey, Tami,
how you doing?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.076
It's none of your
fucking business, Brad.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.870
Okay, come on.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.997
Find someplace
to make that call.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.085
There's gotta be someplace
else you can keep this thing.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.753
It's scaring away the customers.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.005
I tried to get it in the house,

19:32.088 --> 19:33.339
it just wouldn't fit
through the door.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.300
V, I think we can
make some money

19:35.633 --> 19:37.177
renting me out as Jesus.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.386
People rent Jesus?

19:38.469 --> 19:40.013
Yeah, for parties and stuff.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.181
Jesus parties?

19:41.264 --> 19:43.266
I think that's called
church services, Kevin.

19:43.349 --> 19:46.352
Like Santas at Christmas
or Elvis impersonators.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.812
I could work
bachelorette parties,

19:47.896 --> 19:49.981
be one of those
birthday strippers.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.191
A Jesus stripper?

19:51.274 --> 19:52.442
Look at this website.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.610
They got all kinds of people

19:53.693 --> 19:55.570
looking like celebrities
they rent out.

19:55.653 --> 19:56.863
Hi.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.824
What is all that about?

19:59.908 --> 20:01.826
The nuns figured out
we were sending both

20:01.910 --> 20:03.661
of our girls to preschool
for the price of one,

20:03.745 --> 20:05.830
so Kev has to be
Jesus for their parade.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.041
Only now, Kev wants
to be Jesus all the time.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.209
Praise the Lord!

20:10.210 --> 20:12.420
I thought you were taking
some time away from drinking.

20:12.503 --> 20:13.671
May I have a Coke, please?

20:13.755 --> 20:15.173
Absolutely.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.847
What's that?

20:22.931 --> 20:27.018
Well, the zoning went through
on the lot that I invested in,

20:27.101 --> 20:29.229
and Max Whitford bought
me out of the partnership.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.397
No shit, how much?

20:33.942 --> 20:36.152
- A hundred thousand do--
- Ah.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.863
Wow.

20:38.947 --> 20:39.948
Right?

20:40.031 --> 20:41.199
That is fantastic.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.283
So what are you gonna
do with it,

20:42.367 --> 20:43.576
buy a new building?

20:43.660 --> 20:45.995
Oh, hell no.
Fool me once.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.247
So what now?

20:47.330 --> 20:49.165
Well, I quit my job
at the gas station.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.416
Damn right.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.876
And now, I don't know.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.295
I feel like I
got a second chance.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.714
And a third and a fourth.

20:56.798 --> 20:58.466
V, I could have
different costumes

20:58.549 --> 20:59.509
for different occasions.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.052
Wedding Jesus,

21:01.135 --> 21:02.762
Last Supper Jesus,

21:02.845 --> 21:05.056
Bat Mitzvah Jesus.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.558
Last Supper Jesus?

21:07.642 --> 21:10.228
Well, I guess that beats
getting nailed to the cross.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.397
They didn't use
real nails, did they?

21:23.032 --> 21:24.325
Is Liam here?

21:24.409 --> 21:25.410
No.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.369
Really?

21:26.452 --> 21:27.912
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

21:27.996 --> 21:30.039
It's okay, Todd.
I got this.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.084
Hi. Why are you
dressed like that?

21:33.167 --> 21:34.294
Going to church.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.254
- You go to church?
- Yes.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.506
I've been texting
and calling you.

21:38.589 --> 21:39.632
You're supposed to be at the
house right now,

21:39.716 --> 21:40.842
taking care of Frank.

21:40.925 --> 21:41.884
I don't live there anymore.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.928
What?
You can't just move out.

21:44.012 --> 21:44.971
I did last night.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.558
No, absolutely not.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.561
Can I live at Todd's?

21:52.520 --> 21:53.354
Please?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.065
Can somebody get me a beer?

21:56.149 --> 21:57.942
His grandma said I can.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.403
Please, can I
live at Todd's?

22:00.486 --> 22:02.363
Fine, yes, yes.

22:04.365 --> 22:07.243
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.536
I'm going now.

22:08.619 --> 22:09.746
Beer!

22:13.791 --> 22:17.086
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for church.

22:23.426 --> 22:24.927
Yeah, I understand.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.513
Right, great.

22:27.597 --> 22:28.681
Yeah.

22:30.391 --> 22:31.726
No, thank you.

22:37.732 --> 22:39.067
Let me think it over.

22:41.486 --> 22:42.487
Uh-huh.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.545
Positive.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.589
BRCA 1.

23:04.133 --> 23:07.095
That's good,
that's--that's baby good, right?

23:07.178 --> 23:08.805
Yeah, that's baby good.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.973
So, I don't have to worry
about you

23:11.057 --> 23:13.810
trying to find any tall
buildings or anything?

23:14.227 --> 23:15.103
No.

23:15.186 --> 23:17.563
- Okay.
- I'm actually afraid of heights.

23:17.647 --> 23:20.191
Shotgun in the bathtub's
more my style.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.948
Fuck!

23:28.658 --> 23:31.536
I don't wanna have a baby
just to save my tits.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.332
I can't--

23:37.208 --> 23:39.252
I gotta have an abortion.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.796
I mean, I work in a hair salon.
I breathe bleach fumes all day.

23:41.879 --> 23:42.755
This baby is gonna come out

23:42.839 --> 23:44.173
with like five heads
and a dorsal fin.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.175
Tami, Tami, Tami.

23:46.259 --> 23:49.470
Hey, breathe.
Breathe, all right?

23:50.513 --> 23:51.597
Good.

23:52.432 --> 23:56.060
If having the baby
reduces the chances of cancer,

23:56.144 --> 23:59.313
maybe you should have the baby.

23:59.689 --> 24:00.815
And what?

24:01.566 --> 24:04.026
Die on the kid when it's 13
like my mom did to me?

24:04.110 --> 24:05.445
Leave it an orphan?

24:05.903 --> 24:07.405
It wouldn't be an orphan.

24:07.488 --> 24:08.865
Right.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.033
Because you're gonna
take care of it.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.578
Yeah, I would.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.621
And what about when
you die too, Lip?

24:15.705 --> 24:17.081
You know, the way
you smoke cigarettes,

24:17.165 --> 24:19.292
it'll be a miracle
if you make it to 40.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.085
I'll quit.

24:21.169 --> 24:23.212
You'll quit, right.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.679
I was gonna save up
and get my own salon.

24:31.762 --> 24:33.347
- Tami, that's great.
- And then a couple years--

24:33.431 --> 24:35.892
That's great. All right?
You can still do that.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.019
No, I can't, Lip.
I'm gonna be a little busy.

24:38.102 --> 24:41.022
I'm having a baby and then
a double mastectomy.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.574
I need to fuck.
Where can we fuck, huh?

24:51.657 --> 24:53.493
There's gotta be like a
really, really nasty bathroom

24:53.576 --> 24:54.785

25:01.000 --> 25:02.960
You don't wanna fuck me

25:08.090 --> 25:09.258

25:17.892 --> 25:18.893

25:57.306 --> 25:58.307
That's it?

25:58.391 --> 25:59.934
The ADA met with the woman
you punched.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.769
She's not too thrilled
about putting her on the stand.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.563
She's still railing
about the dangerous elements

26:03.646 --> 26:04.855

26:09.902 --> 26:10.903
Yes.

26:10.987 --> 26:12.071
Okay.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.407
All right, I'm gonna come get
you when they call your case.

26:14.490 --> 26:15.741
You stand up, plead guilty,

26:15.825 --> 26:17.868
and apologize to the court
for being an idiot.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.328
Got it.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.163
You seem like
a smart girl, Fiona.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.791
I need another beer.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.968
You watch these

31:46.280 --> 31:47.698
Sure, why not?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.535
Tried and true for scorned
women throughout history.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.250
Yeah, I, um...

32:01.462 --> 32:03.964
I don't think I'm gonna
be okay with that.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.301
Okay with what?

32:08.218 --> 32:09.887
Some kid of mine

32:10.346 --> 32:13.432
out in the world thinking
they weren't wanted, I mean...

32:13.515 --> 32:15.684
For Christ's sake, Lip,
you'd be a shitty father.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.102
Hey, fuck you!

32:17.186 --> 32:18.187
All right? No, I wouldn't.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.438
I give this kid up for adoption,

32:19.521 --> 32:22.483
I wanna get it as far away
from me as possible.

32:22.566 --> 32:23.859
Guam comes to mind.

32:23.943 --> 32:24.777
Guam?

32:24.860 --> 32:27.571
I don't wanna run into
some kid who looks like me,

32:27.655 --> 32:29.323
or worse yet, you,
at the Costco.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.533
All right, so I have the baby,

32:31.617 --> 32:34.578
or you have the baby,
or we have the baby, right?

32:34.662 --> 32:35.829
We?

32:35.913 --> 32:38.082
Oh, what,
are we getting married now?

32:38.165 --> 32:39.249
Want to?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.377
Do you love me?

32:48.133 --> 32:49.510
I like you.

32:51.762 --> 32:54.598
And I think we could end up
loving each other.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.434
Be still, my heart.

32:57.518 --> 32:59.395
- Do you love me?
- Hell no.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.272
I actually think I'm starting
to fucking hate you.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.318
Tami, hey!

33:07.903 --> 33:09.530
Where are you going?

33:25.713 --> 33:27.464
What the hell, Gallagher?

33:27.548 --> 33:29.049
What do you want, Kelly?

33:29.133 --> 33:32.136
19 nails in my tires.
Sugar in my gas tank?

33:32.594 --> 33:34.096
Someone fucked with your truck?

33:34.179 --> 33:35.097
That's terrible.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.182
You gonna try and deny this too?

33:45.482 --> 33:46.775
"Heart beaker?"

33:46.859 --> 33:48.944
You telling me this wasn't you?

33:49.028 --> 33:50.320
I know how to spell.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.116
Carl?

33:57.911 --> 33:59.621
Don't walk away from me!

33:59.705 --> 34:01.665
I thought we were friends!

34:01.749 --> 34:02.750
Is this about you kissing me?

34:02.833 --> 34:04.626
Because I'm sorry I gave you
the wrong signals,

34:04.710 --> 34:06.587
but I'm not gay!

34:07.504 --> 34:10.090
You broke Carl's heart, Kelly.

34:10.174 --> 34:13.594
He may not be able to spell,
but he's a human being,

34:13.677 --> 34:15.721
and he's throwing his life away
because of you.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.181
What are you talking about?

34:17.264 --> 34:18.724
Carl is quitting school

34:18.807 --> 34:20.809
and going to work
at Captain Bob's fulltime.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.144
He's what?

34:22.227 --> 34:25.272
You rejected him,
and West Point rejected him.

34:25.355 --> 34:27.399
He's rejected
and he's giving up.

34:27.483 --> 34:28.734
And that is on you,

34:28.817 --> 34:30.402
for encouraging him to think
that he could ever get in

34:30.486 --> 34:32.362
to fucking West Point
to begin with,

34:32.446 --> 34:34.615
and making him
fall in love with you!

34:34.698 --> 34:38.035
And goddammit, for making me
fall in love with you too!

34:39.203 --> 34:40.662
But this isn't about me.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.623
This is about Carl.

34:42.706 --> 34:45.375
And he is giving up,
and that is on you.

34:45.459 --> 34:49.129
So fuck you and fuck your
dykey ass truck!

35:24.164 --> 35:25.165
Fiona.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.210
Didn't know you
were coming today.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.128
I wasn't.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.046
What, you busy?

35:31.130 --> 35:32.589
Uh...

35:32.673 --> 35:33.924
You know what?
I'll fit you in my schedule.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.261
Hi.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.931
What happened to your head?

35:41.014 --> 35:43.016
Ah, a guy in the
infirmary had lice.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.102
It was easier just to buzz it.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.563
So, you're still working
in the infirmary?

35:47.646 --> 35:50.399
Yeah, well, it beats working
in the laundry like Mickey.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.693
Plus, I get to put my
medical training to use.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.945
Mickey washing undies.

35:55.028 --> 35:56.530
You gotta send me a picture.

35:56.613 --> 35:57.614
Yeah.

36:00.409 --> 36:01.577
Everything okay at home?

36:02.661 --> 36:04.246
Oh, well, the usual.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.291
Frank broke his femur
and is laid up for six months,

36:07.374 --> 36:09.042
driving us all crazy.

36:09.126 --> 36:10.127
Okay.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.129
Lip's girlfriend's pregnant.

36:13.630 --> 36:14.923
Lip has a girlfriend.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.593
Debbie's still convinced
she's gay.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.887
Carl's working at Captain Bob's.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.556
Liam may be missing.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.976
And I'm thinking maybe
it's time for me to go.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.563
Go?

36:29.646 --> 36:31.857
Leave.
Move someplace else.

36:36.028 --> 36:39.198
Shit, I can't believe
I actually said it out loud.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.618
Someplace else, like...?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.661
Somewhere near the Equator.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.955
I'm sick of winters,
you know?

36:47.039 --> 36:50.709
Ice and sleet and
freezing my ass off.

36:52.961 --> 36:55.005
Tell anyone else
about this yet?

36:55.088 --> 36:57.507
I thought I'd try it out
on you first.

37:00.928 --> 37:02.262
You should go.

37:02.679 --> 37:03.555
What?

37:03.639 --> 37:06.266
You should get the fuck out.
You deserve it.

37:06.350 --> 37:09.228
You should go
as far away as you can.

37:10.270 --> 37:13.315
You were hoping that I was gonna
try and talk you out of it?

37:15.442 --> 37:16.485
Maybe.

37:20.822 --> 37:22.115
I'm scared.

37:25.202 --> 37:26.620
And now I'm crying.

37:28.956 --> 37:30.624
When would you leave?

37:33.794 --> 37:36.129
Now. Soon.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.882
Before I chicken out.

37:39.758 --> 37:40.968
Go.

37:42.886 --> 37:45.347
Go as far away from here
as you can,

37:45.430 --> 37:48.100
and don't ever
look back, okay?

37:49.851 --> 37:51.812
We'll always be here for you.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.940
Always.

38:16.253 --> 38:17.963
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.089
Yeah, uh, sorry.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.133
Look, I'll--I'll make up
the hours, alright?

38:21.216 --> 38:22.342
I know you will.

38:23.510 --> 38:24.678
Where is she?

38:24.761 --> 38:25.762
Out front.

38:25.846 --> 38:27.681
Oh, and Oliver Twist is still
waiting for you to show him

38:27.764 --> 38:28.849
how to change a filter.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.267
Fuck.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.144
Hey, Jason.

38:32.227 --> 38:33.353
I'll be right with you,
all right?

38:33.437 --> 38:34.688
- All right.
- All right.

38:45.615 --> 38:48.952
You guys have really shitty
reading material in this dump.

38:49.036 --> 38:51.455
You got a better selection
over at the beauty salon?

38:51.538 --> 38:52.539
Hell yeah.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.499
Gotta keep up
on Brad vs. Angie.

39:05.427 --> 39:06.595
Sorry.

39:07.387 --> 39:08.221
Yeah.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.390
You should be,
you've been kicking my ass

39:10.474 --> 39:11.808
ever since you got pregnant.

39:11.892 --> 39:14.728
I've been kicking your ass
since the first day we met.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.313
I don't know why you like me.

39:16.396 --> 39:18.231
I don't.

39:20.609 --> 39:21.651
I'm hungry.

39:21.735 --> 39:23.236
Do you wanna get
something to eat?

39:26.198 --> 39:27.366
Yeah, I...

39:28.492 --> 39:30.994
I got a couple bikes
I need to finish up.

39:31.495 --> 39:32.621
Cool to wait?

39:32.704 --> 39:35.165
Yeah.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.250
All right.

39:41.630 --> 39:42.631
You know the difference between

39:42.714 --> 39:44.883
perpetual and
periodic inventory?

39:44.966 --> 39:46.093
No idea.

39:46.176 --> 39:48.678
You gotta know your
PAR level on every item.

39:48.762 --> 39:52.474
Bread and butter pickles and
clams are particularly tricky.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.142
Shit.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.690
- Gallagher!
- What are you doing here?

40:03.777 --> 40:04.778
Get off of me!

40:04.861 --> 40:05.946
What do you think you're doing?

40:06.238 --> 40:07.280
Let me go.

40:07.364 --> 40:08.740
You're going back, shithead.

40:08.824 --> 40:10.325
Wait, are you law enforcement?

40:10.742 --> 40:11.785
What?

40:11.868 --> 40:13.495
- Did he skip bail or something?
- No.

40:14.121 --> 40:15.330
Friend.

40:16.373 --> 40:17.416
Fuck you.

40:17.499 --> 40:19.543
You think you could
ruin your life and blame me?

40:19.626 --> 40:20.877
Fuck!

40:23.380 --> 40:24.589
Let me go, Kelly.

40:24.673 --> 40:25.632
Oh, you're Kelly?

40:25.715 --> 40:27.509
You're going back
to school, Carl.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.593
Hey, is he gonna be able
to work

40:28.677 --> 40:29.719
- his dinner shift tonight?
- Yes!

40:29.803 --> 40:31.596
No, he just quit!

40:42.441 --> 40:43.859
Now, that's a woman.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.368
Is Liam back from church yet?

40:53.452 --> 40:54.578
- Yeah.
- Where is he?

40:54.661 --> 40:56.663
- In his room.
- His room?

40:57.330 --> 40:58.457
Liam!

41:00.959 --> 41:02.961
Good afternoon, Deborah.

41:03.336 --> 41:04.463
Enough, Liam.

41:04.546 --> 41:05.714
Come on.
Let's go home.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.175
Have you noticed anything
unusual about me?

41:08.258 --> 41:10.302
- What?
- Like I'm black?

41:10.385 --> 41:12.762
Yeah, I've noticed
that you're black.

41:12.846 --> 41:14.347
And you're not.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.266
Your point?

41:16.349 --> 41:17.934
That you have never made
any attempt

41:18.018 --> 41:21.146
to surround me with my own
cultural and racial heritage.

41:31.698 --> 41:33.408
Whoa, you know who all
these people are?

41:33.492 --> 41:35.911
I've been sleeping here a
couple nights a week all summer,

41:35.994 --> 41:37.412
and no one even noticed.

41:37.913 --> 41:39.039
You know what else?

41:39.122 --> 41:42.292
Mrs. Thompson cooks dinner
every night, real food.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.711
And I get Lucky Charms
for breakfast.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.254
I can buy you Lucky Charms.

41:46.338 --> 41:47.964
Is that really enough,
you think,

41:48.048 --> 41:50.467
for a young, proud man
of African descent

41:50.550 --> 41:53.595
trying to find his identity
in today's white America?

41:58.975 --> 41:59.976
What's this?

42:00.060 --> 42:01.520
My list of demands.

42:01.603 --> 42:04.022
Once agreed upon,
I'll consider coming home.

42:05.565 --> 42:07.234
29 things?

42:07.317 --> 42:09.277
46. There's some on the back.

42:14.324 --> 42:15.408
Book.

42:19.162 --> 42:20.247
Where have you been?

42:20.330 --> 42:23.458
You're daughter's made me read
"The Hungry Goddamn Caterpillar"

42:23.542 --> 42:25.460
like twenty times.

42:26.294 --> 42:27.671
The caterpillar's dead, honey.

42:27.754 --> 42:29.714
Someone stepped on it
and squished it.

42:30.006 --> 42:31.550
So Liam's
down at the Thompson's,

42:31.633 --> 42:33.510
said he's decided he's black
and wants us

42:33.593 --> 42:35.512
to do a bunch of black shit.

42:35.595 --> 42:37.013
Black shit?

42:37.097 --> 42:38.807
His list of demands.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.350
Look at you.

42:43.311 --> 42:44.437
What--?

42:45.397 --> 42:47.107
What is Seamus doing here?

42:47.566 --> 42:49.401
Mrs. Demopolis said we could
borrow him for a few weeks

42:49.484 --> 42:50.694
as long as we feed him.

42:50.777 --> 42:52.654
He took great care of her
when she broke her hip.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.406
Said he loves to
give sponge baths.

42:56.324 --> 42:57.450
Sponge bath?

42:57.534 --> 42:58.577
Yeah!
Come on, Seamus,

42:58.660 --> 43:00.745
let's get you a bucket
of warm water.

43:02.706 --> 43:04.374
I've seen him eat cat feces

43:04.457 --> 43:06.793
out of the sandbox
at the playground.

43:09.504 --> 43:10.964
Book.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.975
Can you undo my hands,
please?

43:22.058 --> 43:23.935
My arm is about to fall asleep.

43:34.738 --> 43:36.114
Can I go now?

43:37.407 --> 43:38.617
Are you going back to school?

43:38.700 --> 43:41.161
- No.
- Shit, Carl.

43:41.745 --> 43:44.414
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
and man up.

43:44.497 --> 43:47.042
So you didn't get into
West Point, so what?

43:47.125 --> 43:49.127
Those guys are a bunch
of pussies anyway.

43:50.211 --> 43:51.338
Go to OTS.

43:51.421 --> 43:52.756
Earn your commission
the old-fashioned way

43:52.839 --> 43:54.341
by being a tough
motherfucker.

43:55.383 --> 43:56.843
Who would you rather
serve under?

43:56.926 --> 43:58.970
Some Westy dipshit
who wrote a paper

43:59.054 --> 44:00.764
on Napoleon's Italian campaign,

44:00.847 --> 44:04.017
or Carl Gallagher,
who can reload a MAC-10

44:04.100 --> 44:06.895
while diving under an Impala
during a drive-by?

44:10.065 --> 44:11.441
Exactly.

44:13.026 --> 44:15.487
So are you done being a pussy,

44:15.570 --> 44:17.906
and ready to get back to
being the man that I love?

44:17.989 --> 44:20.367
Wait, the what?

44:20.909 --> 44:22.160
Damn, you're dense.

44:31.628 --> 44:33.004
Knucklehead.

44:35.006 --> 44:36.424
I need a beer.

44:48.353 --> 44:50.021
You coming, asshole?

44:54.484 --> 44:56.820
Hey, Fiona,
I found Liam.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.238
He's moved out
into Todd's house,

44:58.321 --> 45:01.366
says he's not coming back
unless he gets his own room.

45:07.997 --> 45:09.207
Quick shower and
then we'll go to dinner?

45:09.290 --> 45:10.583
- Lip!
- Okay.

45:10.667 --> 45:11.793
Yeah?

45:11.876 --> 45:12.877
Fiona's leaving.

45:12.961 --> 45:14.963
She's upstairs packing
her stuff right now.

45:15.922 --> 45:16.756
What?

45:22.345 --> 45:24.180
Hey, you guys
know there's a giant dude

45:24.264 --> 45:27.100
in your living room
giving Frank a bath?

45:27.183 --> 45:30.145
Keep your arm up, now,
till I finish under here.

45:53.251 --> 45:54.502
So...

45:56.629 --> 45:57.964
Yeah.

46:03.636 --> 46:04.763
Where to?

46:06.139 --> 46:07.348
Not sure.

46:09.350 --> 46:10.477
You have a...

46:11.478 --> 46:13.480
educated guess, or...?

46:14.522 --> 46:17.400
I'll probably turn around before
I even make it to the airport.

46:17.942 --> 46:19.068
No, you won't.

46:27.994 --> 46:29.162
Baby?

46:30.079 --> 46:31.539

46:35.460 --> 46:36.836

46:45.929 --> 46:47.931
Take care of 'em for me,
will you?

46:49.265 --> 46:50.141
Promise?

46:50.225 --> 46:51.976
Promise.

46:54.479 --> 46:56.564
That giant's
name is Seamus,

46:56.648 --> 46:57.941
and he's trying to
do something to your dad

46:58.024 --> 47:00.527
with salt water
and a turkey baster.

47:02.445 --> 47:03.696
Oh.

47:03.780 --> 47:05.532
Hi.

47:06.950 --> 47:08.243
All right, well,
you're not going anywhere

47:08.326 --> 47:09.869
without a goodbye party,
all right?

47:09.953 --> 47:10.787
- No.
- Yes!

47:10.870 --> 47:12.080
We are throwing you
a party,

47:12.163 --> 47:13.873
so shut the fuck up
and have a good time.

47:13.957 --> 47:15.625
All right, Gallaghers!

47:16.084 --> 47:17.085
<i>Party!</i>

47:19.295 --> 47:21.965
<i>So, Fiona is
going to move away,</i>

47:22.048 --> 47:24.175
<i>so we're throwing
a big ass party, alright?</i>

47:24.634 --> 47:26.135
Going? Going where?

47:26.219 --> 47:27.220
Nobody knows.

47:27.303 --> 47:29.389
Carl, you're on pizza
and beer, yeah?

47:29.472 --> 47:30.431
- I'll drive.
- Okay.

47:30.515 --> 47:31.349
I'll go get Liam.

47:31.432 --> 47:32.684
All right, I'll round up
Kev and V

47:32.767 --> 47:34.519
and get the barbecue from them.
You can drive?

47:34.602 --> 47:36.020
- Yeah.
- Great.

47:36.688 --> 47:38.022
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Okay.

47:38.106 --> 47:39.566
Wait, stop, no.

47:39.649 --> 47:41.109
I can do it, S--
give me the sponge.

47:41.192 --> 47:42.777
I can do it.

47:42.861 --> 47:44.028
Get in there good, now.

47:44.112 --> 47:45.071
I know how to do it.

47:45.154 --> 47:46.239
Mm-hmm.

48:09.429 --> 48:11.180
Going somewhere?

48:17.729 --> 48:19.230
Everybody leave?

48:20.064 --> 48:24.611
They're out gathering supplies
for your bon voyage celebration.

48:27.030 --> 48:28.364
You skipping the fun?

48:29.282 --> 48:32.035
Yeah, afraid if I stay,
I might never leave.

48:36.247 --> 48:38.416
This is getting a little
tepid there, Seamus.

48:38.499 --> 48:40.376
Could you heat up the water?

48:48.509 --> 48:49.677
Seamus?

48:49.761 --> 48:51.346
Debbie's idea.

48:52.305 --> 48:53.681
Free.

49:09.489 --> 49:11.908
Well, I'll see you around.

49:18.164 --> 49:19.999
You did a good job.

49:20.083 --> 49:23.127
Monica wasn't up to it.
You stepped in and helped.

49:23.461 --> 49:24.754
Thanks.

49:29.425 --> 49:30.885
"Helped".

49:34.013 --> 49:36.015
I did it all, Frank.

49:36.516 --> 49:38.810
Yeah, well...

49:39.602 --> 49:42.105
if that helps you sleep better.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.945
See you around, Frank.

49:49.028 --> 49:50.363
I doubt it.

49:50.446 --> 49:53.032
Okay, lift me up.
