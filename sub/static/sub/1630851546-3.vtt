Hello,Premeditated podcast
listeners.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.356
Have you ever heard
of Joe Kelsey?

00:08.399 --> 00:10.575
That was the name given
to a European immigrant

00:10.619 --> 00:12.490
after World War II.

00:12.534 --> 00:16.407
Joe spoke no English,
had no family and no friends,

00:16.451 --> 00:20.455
but in 1950, he landed a job
in a Poughkeepsie factory,

00:20.498 --> 00:24.067
where a watchman was killed
in a robbery.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.895
Joe confessed to the murder.

00:25.938 --> 00:27.505
He was executed
in the electric chair,

00:27.549 --> 00:30.508
leaving behind zero trace
of his existence

00:30.552 --> 00:34.251
except for one box
of evidence.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.340
I tracked that box
through federal,

00:36.384 --> 00:38.342
state and local warehouses,

00:38.386 --> 00:40.692
till it ended up
in government storage

00:40.736 --> 00:42.999
near Horseshoe Bay, Maine,

00:43.043 --> 00:44.914
where as fate would have it,

00:44.957 --> 00:47.960
a listener of
thisPremeditated pod

00:48.004 --> 00:51.138
with municipal connections
has promised

00:51.181 --> 00:52.835
to deliver me that box.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.794
In exchange, I'll be telling
this young woman

00:55.838 --> 00:59.189
everything I've ever unearthed
about the Frozen Hearts Killer,

00:59.233 --> 01:02.540
who-- as I have
frequently predicted--

01:02.584 --> 01:04.325
recently resurfaced.

01:04.368 --> 01:06.327
It's all going down
live at DetectiveCon

01:06.370 --> 01:08.242
in Portland, Maine.

01:08.285 --> 01:11.810
Featuring yours truly,
Laci McAllister.

or just come and find me.

You're fired up
for DetectiveCon?

01:38.968 --> 01:40.839
Personally,

01:40.883 --> 01:42.276
I am not looking forward
to a bunch of

01:42.319 --> 01:44.539

pointing

01:44.582 --> 01:47.019
their magnifying glasses
at me.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.891
But if we want to catch
the Frozen Hearts Killer,

01:48.934 --> 01:50.414
this is a trade
we have to make.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.982
Didn't I recently see you
giving a press conference?

01:53.025 --> 01:54.636
I mean, what's the point
of all this PR

01:54.679 --> 01:56.768
if you can't bask in
the adulation of your people?

01:56.812 --> 02:00.120
The only people that I have
are from Horseshoe Bay.

02:04.646 --> 02:07.823
Not to, you know, dampen

02:07.866 --> 02:10.608

you have for DetectiveCon.

02:10.652 --> 02:14.090
Nah. DetectiveCon can bite
the entirety of my butt.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.961
I'm just stoked to go
anywhere where I don't have

02:16.005 --> 02:17.876
to think about having
Odette's spirit trapped

02:17.920 --> 02:19.530
in my subconscious,

02:19.574 --> 02:22.359
or anywhere where Nick
isn't stressing me out.

02:22.403 --> 02:25.101
Everything okay?No, everything's fine.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.060
Just sometimes the best way
to support someone you love

02:28.104 --> 02:30.106
is to give them the space
to do their thing,

Not our problem.

It's just our ticket

03:00.745 --> 03:02.878

identity confidentially,

03:02.921 --> 03:04.445

Your fiancée yelled,
"Winter of George,"

03:35.737 --> 03:37.869
Yeah, 'cause George and I
both realized

03:37.913 --> 03:39.697
I was stressing her out,
and it'd be better

03:39.741 --> 03:42.265
if I just took this down
the homestretch without her.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.702
And Nancy probably assumed
you had your own stuff going on.

03:44.746 --> 03:47.401
Yeah, well,
that's not accurate.

Are you sure you haven't
seen my youth center list?

03:50.273 --> 03:52.536
It was on a, uh,
a yellow legal pad

He confessed to the murder.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.048
He was executed for it.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.137

11:02.009 --> 11:03.750
Oh, thank you.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.541
"I, Joe Kelsey,

11:12.584 --> 11:14.717

and informed of my rights,

11:14.761 --> 11:16.806
"do hereby waive
my right to a trial.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.374

11:25.728 --> 11:29.689
No. I really don't like
that sound.

11:29.732 --> 11:33.954
"I struck the night watchman
a blow with my hammer."

11:33.997 --> 11:36.478
So, of course, you follow it.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.480
No one cares about George.
Whatever.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.524

11:43.485 --> 11:45.008

That's his hammer.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.710

11:54.409 --> 11:56.541

Dude, I didn't know
you spoke Yiddish.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.725
I don't.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.683
My grandparents did.

12:51.727 --> 12:54.121
I only remember a couple words
here and there.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.384
Something about that reenactment
didn't make sense.

12:56.427 --> 12:59.517
Just one thing?

12:59.561 --> 13:01.171
Joe Kelsey was left-handed.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.434
Or his ghost was
at least.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.175
He swung with his left hand.

13:05.219 --> 13:06.220
And?

13:07.699 --> 13:09.223
And...

13:09.266 --> 13:12.530
the coroner's
report indicates

13:12.574 --> 13:15.707
that the killer swung
with his right hand.

13:15.751 --> 13:18.710
A downward blow
from behind

13:18.754 --> 13:20.582
to the right side of the skull
would be consistent

13:20.625 --> 13:22.671
with a right-handed attack.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.325
Maybe it was left-handed

13:24.368 --> 13:26.283
and just kept hitting
the same spot?

13:26.327 --> 13:27.981
It wouldn't match
the blood spatter on the wall.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.373
So, what the ghost showed us

13:29.417 --> 13:30.940
matches his confession,

13:30.984 --> 13:33.508
but it's not
what actually happened?NANCY: Right.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.727
The evidence can't lie.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.642
But a-a ghost can.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.644
Maybe he wants us
to believe

13:39.688 --> 13:41.864
that he was the murderer.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.387
Uh, we already think that.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.475
Right, the world did.

13:44.519 --> 13:49.089
Based on, what,
a confession

13:49.132 --> 13:51.482
that could have easily been
falsified and written

13:51.526 --> 13:54.050
by cops who spoke
fluent English, unlike Joe.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.443
So, they executed

13:55.486 --> 13:57.271
an innocent man.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.316
Yeah.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.318
But that's not why he's upset.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.930
He's upset about
the lie being exposed

14:03.973 --> 14:06.410
by people looking
too deep into the evidence.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.630
That's why he's trying to
keep it all locked up here.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.893
I mean, but why would a ghost
work so hard

14:10.937 --> 14:13.026
to convince us that he's guilty
if he's not?

14:13.069 --> 14:15.419
I don't know.
That's the question.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.943
Hey.

14:20.424 --> 14:22.905

Joe's personal effects.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.081

14:25.125 --> 14:26.953

14:33.089 --> 14:34.221
All right, what you got?

14:34.264 --> 14:36.440
So, I found an account
in Hannah's files

14:36.484 --> 14:39.443
about a curio shop that was
selling estate sale heirlooms

14:39.487 --> 14:41.706
by a ghost who still wanted
to possess them.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.579
So the shopkeeper burned them
all and the spirit moved on.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.277
Sweet.
Bess says burn it all.

14:47.321 --> 14:48.888
You're on speaker.[phone beeps]

14:48.931 --> 14:51.151
Um, that-that's gonna cause
big problems,

14:51.194 --> 14:53.762
because I promised the evidence
to Laci.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.330
But the ghost doesn't want
the evidence examined.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.332
I mean, does Laci even know
what's in the box?

14:58.375 --> 15:00.160
Okay.
That is a good point.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.552
It's a mystery box.

15:01.596 --> 15:04.338
So if she opens it,
anything that looks 1950s-like,

15:04.381 --> 15:06.514
it should still feel legit.

15:06.557 --> 15:07.732
Exactly.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.125
And there's plenty
of vintage decorations

15:09.169 --> 15:11.040
at the Historical Society
that could fit the bill.

15:11.084 --> 15:14.304
I mean, it's misleading
and not very honest.

15:14.348 --> 15:15.523
Eh...

15:15.566 --> 15:17.177
But in the debate
between what Laci wants

15:17.220 --> 15:18.656
versus what the ghost wants,

15:18.700 --> 15:20.267
I think we should prioritize
the lives we can save

15:20.310 --> 15:21.616
by catching
the Frozen Hearts Killer

15:21.659 --> 15:23.313

I was imagining things,

to this adventure,

I thought that you were
leaving me behind on purpose.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.967
I guess I was feeling
a little bit mothered by you.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.143

I think I made a connection
with Joe Kelsey's ghost.

Maybe because I kept something

24:49.966 --> 24:53.404
Right. So, what do
you know about him?

24:55.450 --> 24:58.845
Well, I did a show
real early in my podcast

24:58.888 --> 25:01.543
where I proposed that FHK
stopped killing three years ago

25:01.587 --> 25:03.980
because he used argon
as a freezing agent

25:04.024 --> 25:05.504
and accidentally froze off
two of his fingers.

25:05.547 --> 25:08.811
I did a deep dive.
I listened to that episode.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.900
Yeah, but you can't listen
to my voice mails.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.686
A listener called in.
Which was remarkable,

25:13.729 --> 25:16.906
because although I get about
100,000 downloads per pod now,

25:16.950 --> 25:19.692
I had no idea I had
any listeners back then.

25:19.735 --> 25:22.608
And he said he liked
the part when I said

25:22.651 --> 25:24.914
that FHK had a lot of pride.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.787
And that he targeted victims
who he felt slighted him.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.658
You did listen.

25:30.833 --> 25:34.620
The caller thanked me
for, quote...

25:34.663 --> 25:36.099
"Getting it right."

25:36.143 --> 25:38.798
Well, he was claiming
to be the killer.Exactly.

25:38.841 --> 25:41.148
I profiled the caller,
I sifted through metadata,

25:41.191 --> 25:42.845
and I tracked
his digital footprint

25:42.889 --> 25:45.544
to the alias Richard Trott.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.937
The eight-fingered man.
I got that far, too.

25:47.981 --> 25:50.374
Did you get his real name?

25:50.418 --> 25:52.768
Rodric T. Hartt.
