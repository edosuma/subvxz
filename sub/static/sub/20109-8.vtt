WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:03.037
Morty, hurry!

00:03.071 --> 00:04.838
Return the Truth Tortoise!

00:04.872 --> 00:07.241
Morty, whatever you do,
don't drop the Truth Tortoise!

00:07.275 --> 00:08.542
Also really important,

00:08.576 --> 00:10.178
whatever you do,
don't look into its eyes!

00:10.211 --> 00:12.846
I... I did look at it, Rick!
I've been looking at it!

00:12.880 --> 00:14.582
Now you're gonna know
everything, Morty!

00:14.615 --> 00:16.517
Good job! Way to go!
You fucked everything up!

00:18.252 --> 00:20.688
It's in my head!

00:20.721 --> 00:22.356
Ah!

00:25.793 --> 00:28.562
Oh, geez, I... I can't get that
Truth Tortoise out of my head.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.564
Yeah, I told you not
to look into its eyes.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.700
Hey, Morty, let's watch some
interdimensional cable.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.235
Remember how we used to do that?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.036
Rick, I can't...
I can't go on.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.372
I-I can't go on like this
with the Truth Tortoise
shit in my head.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.607
I-I wish you could just...

00:39.640 --> 00:41.742
Erase the memory from your mind?

00:41.775 --> 00:43.744
How did you know
I was gonna say that?

00:43.777 --> 00:45.446
Come on, Morty, come with me.

00:45.479 --> 00:48.549
After you.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.418
What the hell is this?!

00:50.451 --> 00:52.019
This, Morty, is my archive

00:52.052 --> 00:54.722
of all the experiences
you've begged me to remove

00:54.755 --> 00:56.757
from your life,
lest you go insane.

00:56.790 --> 01:00.428
I call them
Morty's Mind Blowers.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.063
And we'll be doing this instead
of interdimensional cable.

01:03.097 --> 01:11.097
**

01:13.107 --> 01:21.107
**

01:23.117 --> 01:31.117
**

01:34.795 --> 01:36.964
How long have I been asking you
to remove memories?

01:36.997 --> 01:39.333
Since the first time
your mind was blown.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.668
Ahh, here it is.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.270
Classic.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.637
There's no dust on it because

01:43.671 --> 01:45.105
this isn't the first time
we've done this.

01:45.139 --> 01:49.277
- What?!
- I call this one "Moonspiracy"!

01:54.682 --> 01:57.618
Huh, wow.
That's incredible.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.622
What the heck?

02:01.655 --> 02:03.624
Morty, do you realize how
ridiculous that sounds?

02:03.657 --> 02:05.259
Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.760
Are you serious?

02:06.794 --> 02:08.762
Half the crap we've seen,
and you think that sounds crazy?

02:08.795 --> 02:10.631
I've been to 300 versions
of Earth's moon,

02:10.663 --> 02:12.633
including this one,
and I've never seen signs

02:12.666 --> 02:14.468
of a "regular dude,"
as you describe him,

02:14.502 --> 02:15.703
hanging out up there.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.971
It's probably just
a smudge on the lens.

02:18.005 --> 02:21.041
Smudge on the lens?
Smudge on the lens?!

02:21.074 --> 02:23.477
I know the difference between
a man threatening me

02:23.511 --> 02:25.446
and a smudge on
the goddamn lens, Summer!

02:25.479 --> 02:27.348
Morty, calm down!
Are you feeling okay?

02:27.381 --> 02:29.317
I'm fine!

02:29.350 --> 02:30.784
So sensitive.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.655
Principal Vagina: Kids,
I'd like to introduce you all

02:34.688 --> 02:37.658
to our new guidance counselor,
Mr. Lunas.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.328
I look forward
to helping guide you all

02:40.361 --> 02:42.496
towards a brighter future.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.132
I believe every
student should...

02:45.165 --> 02:47.335
shoot for the moon.

02:47.368 --> 02:51.372
**

02:51.405 --> 02:53.707
Got you now, you son of a bitch.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.178
What's this?

02:58.212 --> 03:00.848
Proof that Mr. Lunas
isn't who he says he is!

03:00.881 --> 03:02.683
He's not a guidance counselor?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.918
I... I assume he's qualified
to be one, who isn't?

03:04.952 --> 03:08.188
But he also lives on the moon.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.823
Okay.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.058
Hmm.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.493
Is that it?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.194
Is he doing anything
to hurt anyone?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.029
Oh, he's up to something.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.165
I think I understand.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.368
"Up to something,"
"lives on the moon."

03:20.401 --> 03:22.270
Okay, I'll talk to him.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.882
What did he say?

03:34.915 --> 03:36.784
Denied the moon stuff,
but that's what pedophiles do,

03:36.817 --> 03:38.419
they deny,
it's their bread and butter.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.720
Pedophile?
You don't think so?

03:39.753 --> 03:41.722
I thought the moon thing
might have been code.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.357
No, he's literally
from the moon!

03:43.391 --> 03:44.692
Well, you saw him react.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.127
Moon or not,
that dude likes 'em young.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.968
Gordon Lunas was a good Marine.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.471
We don't know what drove
him to take his own life,

03:57.505 --> 03:59.573
but we want to remember
the good things.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.375
Like how, from a certain angle,

04:01.409 --> 04:04.278
some people would say
he looked like a smudge.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.051
Oh, my God, what have I done?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.119
What have I done?

04:12.152 --> 04:15.423
Jesus, I made that guy
kill himself!

04:15.456 --> 04:16.824
Only in a literal sense.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.059
Here's one I call
"Morty's Menagerie."

04:19.091 --> 04:21.060
They don't all
have titles, though.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.163
It's not a "Simpsons"
Halloween special,

04:23.196 --> 04:26.166
more like a clip show made
of clips you never saw!

04:27.100 --> 04:29.102
I can't believe we got
put into a menagerie.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.638
So this guy collects
living beings?

04:30.671 --> 04:32.406
Yeah, you know like
commemorative plates,

04:32.440 --> 04:33.941
but less off-putting.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.744
You'll get it when you're still
actively dating in your 40s.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.346
Assess this with
cold indifference,

04:38.379 --> 04:39.613
you beany-headed prick!

04:39.647 --> 04:41.482
Hey, keep it down!

04:41.515 --> 04:43.116
Just our luck, menagerie beneath

04:43.150 --> 04:45.152
the "boulder people"
of Granitor Seven.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.787
I can't take it anymore, Rick!

04:46.820 --> 04:48.288
Relax, Morty!

04:48.322 --> 04:50.324
I can't relax! R-R-Rick, we...
We gotta get outta here!

04:50.358 --> 04:52.292
I don't care what it takes!
Anything!

04:52.326 --> 04:53.794
- Anything?
- Anything!

04:53.827 --> 04:55.663
All right, well, you're gonna
have to take off your shirt.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.631
Not yet.
I'll tell you when.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.338
Dear God.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.806
What?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.975
The signal turned out to be...

05:08.008 --> 05:10.511
There's no other way
to put it...

05:10.544 --> 05:11.979
Instructions.
For?

05:12.012 --> 05:14.982
A vehicle, sir,
an interstellar vehicle.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.985
We'll need a pilot.
I wonder if there's a volunteer.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.186
Mm.

05:19.219 --> 05:22.055
Oh, the schematics specify
a second, smaller pilot.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.157
I mean, they really
specify smaller.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.727
They have to be exactly 5'3".

05:26.760 --> 05:29.196
Chang, you may have majored
in Liberal Arts,

05:29.229 --> 05:31.865
but I think you're about
to make history.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.669
Woman:
Primary systems, check.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.371
Auxiliary systems, check.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.006
See you soon.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.712
Okay, now.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.647
Greetings.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.015
You're...
You look...

05:48.048 --> 05:50.350
We've possessed forms
your mind can accept.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.686
Here are some customary
clothing gifts.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.488
Please, put them on.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.657
- May we?
- Of course, yes.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.091
We followed your instructions.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.861
We have so much
to learn from you.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.531
I know, right?

06:08.469 --> 06:11.171
Hey, how come I was able to see
those other people's memories?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.040
I... I wouldn't have been
around for that.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.073
Yeah, sometimes I gotta do
a little editing, Morty.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.343
It helps the mind blowers

06:16.376 --> 06:18.378
play a little bit better
upon revisiting.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.848
I call this one
"The Whole Enchilada.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.751
Here, Morty, this'll make
your urine drinkable.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.553
Now can we keep shopping?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.254
I am Zikzak.

06:27.287 --> 06:29.790
Ah, shit, Morty, get behind me.
It's a fuckin' alien overlord!

06:29.823 --> 06:31.692
It's okay.
Here.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.026
Oh, I misjudged.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.529
"I am Floop Floopian.
Please kill me."

06:35.563 --> 06:37.130
That's right, Morty.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.867
The Floop Floopians achieve
an eternal orgasmic afterlife,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.902
so long as they're killed
by a great warrior.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.804
I'm flattered, by the way.
Thank you very much.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.205
So you're gonna kill him?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.240
Eh, let's get some lunch first.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.278
**

06:51.311 --> 06:53.246
So, you want to get shot
in the head, or...

06:53.280 --> 06:54.815
Well, as long as
the wound is fatal,

06:54.848 --> 06:56.283
I don't really mind
where you shoot me.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.285
Cool.
I'm gonna go take a quick shit.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.688
Well, I gotta say.
You know, I'm a little envious.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.656
Your species has
an actual afterlife.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.291
That's gotta be nice.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.659
Wh-What do you mean?

07:05.693 --> 07:08.095
Well, you know, here on Earth,
w-we don't know what's going on.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.130
It must be nice for you guys to,
you know, have that...

07:10.163 --> 07:12.365
Have that proof's in
the pudding, you know, evidence.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.471
Evidence?
There's supposed to be evidence?

07:17.505 --> 07:19.940
Um, yeah, uh...

07:19.973 --> 07:23.977
otherwise,
how do you know if it's true?

07:26.313 --> 07:28.582
Wait, you don't...

07:28.616 --> 07:31.685
All right, so you want to do
this here or outside?

07:33.521 --> 07:34.788
Run!

07:36.323 --> 07:37.625
I don't wanna die!

07:42.195 --> 07:44.464
Oh, God, it's all real!
Oh, it hurts!

07:44.498 --> 07:45.966
Oh, I shouldn't have doubted it!

07:45.999 --> 07:48.201
I shouldn't have let
you make me doubt it!

07:48.235 --> 07:51.271
Aah!
I blame you, I blame you!

07:51.304 --> 07:53.140
But he said there
wasn't any evidence!

07:53.173 --> 07:54.608
That was a ton of evidence!

07:54.642 --> 07:55.809
Well, silver lining.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.210
Now I know their
religion's real.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.179
They have a hell,
and it does not look good.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.281
I noticed you never finished
your chimichanga,

08:01.314 --> 08:03.717
so I got some room for it now,
if you know what I mean.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.185
Holy Shit!

08:05.218 --> 08:07.688
How many of these are just
horrible mistakes I've made?

08:07.721 --> 08:09.389
I mean, maybe
I'd stop making so many

08:09.422 --> 08:11.158
if I let myself learn from them!

08:11.191 --> 08:13.060
Don't break your back
creating a lesson, Morty.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.461
It's a freeform anthology.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.296
I'm getting annoyed
you're not hearing that.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.065
As you can see around me,
your mind's been blown

08:18.098 --> 08:21.569
countless times,
and not always by yourself.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.170
Ah, shit, I don't even...

08:23.203 --> 08:24.672
This better not
have been a good one.

08:24.705 --> 08:25.973
What is this?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.841
Great, "Booger AIDS,"
"AIDS Booger."

08:27.875 --> 08:29.409
I gotta start using
real file names.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.144
In the meantime,
enjoy a grab bag

08:31.178 --> 08:35.347
of mind blowers I call
"Poop AIDS underscore copy."

08:35.381 --> 08:37.585
Alien Warlord: I'm not
an unreasonable man, Beth Smith.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.153
I know children are everything
to a mammal.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.989
I will spare one of their lives.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.725
You simply have to choose.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.227
Summer!
Summer.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.898
**

08:50.931 --> 08:52.332
You're not gonna believe this.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.934
I went to Phoebe
instead of Titan.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.203
It's, like, hello, Saturn,
after ten moons,

08:56.236 --> 08:58.872
time to stop naming and start
numbering, you know?

08:58.906 --> 09:01.174
What's... Wh-What's with you
assholes?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.443
Morty, please, don't do this.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.880
Your Morty is gone!

09:06.914 --> 09:08.882
I am Voltamatron,
Destroyer of Worlds!

09:08.916 --> 09:11.418
Grandpa Rick, there must be some
scientific way to save him!

09:11.451 --> 09:13.520
Not scientific,
but there may be a way.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.956
Morty, I know you're in there.
It's me, your grandpa.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.958
I know I can be mean,
but I love you, Morty.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.426
We all do,
you gotta fight this thing.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.361
I know you can.
You're stronger than all of us!

09:21.394 --> 09:23.563
Morty, it's mom! We love you,
you have to fight it!

09:23.597 --> 09:26.133
Come on, Morty!
Fight that stupid worm thing!

09:26.166 --> 09:27.635
We love you!

09:27.668 --> 09:28.936
We love you so much!

09:28.969 --> 09:30.370
Rick: Yes, Morty, come on,
you're doing it!

09:30.403 --> 09:32.940
You're doing it!
You're doing it!

09:34.808 --> 09:36.276
Should we pull it out?

09:36.309 --> 09:38.946
No, don't touch it.
Just keep loving Morty!

09:38.979 --> 09:41.314
We still love you.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.983
But I do have
a thing at 6:00.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.618
Oh, God, do I have
to keep looking?

09:44.652 --> 09:46.920
Geez, Morty, come on,
pinch it off already!

09:49.256 --> 09:52.092
Don't! Oh, God, sorry, Morty,
I love you!

09:53.627 --> 09:55.428
God, is there going
to be an intermission?

09:55.462 --> 09:57.597
Excuse me, but I ordered
the large evil space worm.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.499
I know, it's like,
is that a demon slug

09:59.532 --> 10:01.268
in your stomach,
or are you just happy to...

10:01.301 --> 10:03.336
Sorry!

10:03.370 --> 10:05.973
Well, I guess it's nice to know
the whole family sucks!

10:06.006 --> 10:07.507
So if the blues ones
are my fault,

10:07.540 --> 10:10.277
and the purple ones are my
family's, what are the red ones?

10:10.310 --> 10:12.913
Yeah, d-don't read
into it, Morty!

10:14.481 --> 10:15.783
Ahh.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.185
Shit! We need to find shelter
before the sunset, Morty.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.688
Venzenulon Nine has a night
temperature of 300 below!

10:20.721 --> 10:23.256
We'll freeze, Morty!
W-We'll be dead in seconds!

10:23.290 --> 10:25.025
I... I think I saw
a cave over there.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.626
You've seen
too many movies, Morty.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.262
A cave isn't gonna cut it.
We're gonna have to use Beebo.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.464
Beebo led us to water!
He's our friend!

10:31.498 --> 10:33.767
- He won't even feel it!
- Oh, no, no!

10:36.336 --> 10:39.106
You wanna die, Morty?
Get in Beebo!

10:39.139 --> 10:41.842
Oh, no, no!

10:41.875 --> 10:44.011
Brace for the ice limit.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.646
Here it comes!

10:49.349 --> 10:53.286
Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine
or Venzenulon Seven?

10:53.320 --> 10:56.223
Wait a minute, why would I ask
for that to be removed?

10:56.256 --> 10:58.558
Are the red ones stuff
you wanted removed?

10:58.591 --> 11:01.261
Ooh, that's clever, Morty, but I
don't use color to sort things

11:01.294 --> 11:03.363
because I'm not a mouse in
a European children's book.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.532
Then why are all those
pink ones by the liquor?

11:05.565 --> 11:07.134
Liquor?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.509
Shit, that was close.
We lost Captain Sky.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.311
He gave his life
for the uprising.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.347
Yeah. It really makes
you think, huh, Morty?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.349
We should never take
things for granite.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.051
- What?
- I'm just saying, life's short.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.552
We shouldn't take things
for granite.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.855
- Are you saying "granite"?
- Well, yeah.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.522
It's "granted,"
with a "D."

11:29.556 --> 11:32.425
Take things for granted.
Did you actually think it was...

11:32.459 --> 11:34.094
Jesus Christ, Rick,

11:34.127 --> 11:36.163
what are you, a boulder...
A rock person?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.198
How long have you been saying
that wrong?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.499
Oh, you like that, huh?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.234
I b-b-bet that really
blows your mind.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.702
I mean, yeah,
it's kind of great.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.072
- You want me to erase it?
- What, you can do that?

11:45.105 --> 11:47.707
Ah, shit.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.709
I fuckin' knew it,
you piece of shit!

11:49.743 --> 11:52.212
You... You...
You're a fuckin' asshole, Rick!

11:52.245 --> 11:53.680
Take it easy, Morty, come on.
Just relax.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.393
No, I'm not gonna fuckin' relax!
Come here!

11:55.415 --> 11:57.050
Let go of me, you little bitch!

11:57.084 --> 11:58.952
I'm gonna grab you by
the scruff of your...
Take that!

11:58.986 --> 12:00.821
Ohh!

12:00.854 --> 12:02.422
- Umm.
- Umm. Uhh.

12:02.455 --> 12:03.891
- What...
- What's going on?

12:03.924 --> 12:05.192
- Where am I?
- Who are we?

12:05.225 --> 12:06.393
Who am I?

12:06.426 --> 12:08.361
I think I'm an adolescent boy.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.630
Huh, and I'm an elderly man.

12:10.663 --> 12:15.068
And we appear to be in some kind
of secret confined space.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.569
Yeah, umm...

12:16.603 --> 12:18.205
Don't look at me like that.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.273
For all we know, you could be
the fuckin' weirdo.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.311
Huh, these things are
obviously storage units,

12:24.344 --> 12:26.279
and since we can't remember
what went wrong,

12:26.313 --> 12:29.149
my guess is that the technology
involves memory,

12:29.182 --> 12:32.385
and that this thing on your head
is designed to...

12:32.419 --> 12:34.054
Tell us the code, jagoff!

12:35.688 --> 12:37.090
It's pointless.
He's stonewalling.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.164
Rick, if we don't unlock those
vaccines, Earth dies!

12:39.192 --> 12:41.294
You know, it might be time to
step up your interrogation!

12:41.328 --> 12:42.963
Not sure what
you're implying, Morty,

12:42.996 --> 12:44.798
but some lines I don't cross.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.633
Yeah, well,
I crossed every line I had

12:46.666 --> 12:49.002
when this bastard
tried to kill Jessica!

12:50.971 --> 12:54.607
Okay, see those two fleshy sacs
under his chin, Morty?

12:54.641 --> 12:56.676
Grab 'em.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.611
You remember the codes now?

12:58.645 --> 13:00.013
Twist!

13:01.414 --> 13:03.984
Give us the codes, man!
Twist harder, Morty!

13:04.017 --> 13:05.953
Harder!

13:05.986 --> 13:08.188
Okay, let go, let go,
let him breathe.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.191
He wants to make a deal.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.326
Half the codes now,
half after you finish.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.528
But can we trust...
Wait, what?

13:15.562 --> 13:16.696
F-Finish what?

13:16.729 --> 13:17.931
Y-You know...

13:17.965 --> 13:19.466
I thought I was torturing him!

13:19.499 --> 13:20.834
Oh, and this disappoints you?

13:20.868 --> 13:22.702
Do I tell him we don't
have a deal, Morty?

13:22.735 --> 13:24.371
Because if we can
kill our enemies,

13:24.404 --> 13:26.874
but we can't jack them off, then
how are we better than them?

13:26.907 --> 13:28.842
Well, what did you find out?

13:28.876 --> 13:30.610
We're partners, I guess,

13:30.643 --> 13:32.846
and we fight aliens,
like "Men in Black"?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.714
"Men in Black,"
"Men in Black."

13:34.747 --> 13:36.616
I have "Men in Black 2" in here.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.118
So... So you get
the general idea.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.552
Not quite.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.155
It's basically an endless string
of callbacks to...

13:42.189 --> 13:45.425
All right, save it for Youtube.
I'll keep looking for clues.

13:48.695 --> 13:49.863
What are you doing?

13:49.897 --> 13:51.531
You want your shelf
level or not?

13:51.564 --> 13:54.301
And if I say yes, you're gonna
provide that for me with that?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.368
Yes, see the bubble?

13:55.402 --> 13:57.004
I'm familiar with
the bubble, Morty.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.906
I also dabble in precision,

13:58.939 --> 14:00.941
and if you think
you can even approach it

14:00.974 --> 14:02.509
with your sad, naked,
caveman eyeball

14:02.542 --> 14:05.212
and a bubble of fucking air,
you're the reason this species

14:05.245 --> 14:07.180
is a failure,
and it makes me angry!

14:07.214 --> 14:08.381
You're drunk.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.017
You want to put up a shelf,
put up a shelf.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.219
You want to experience
true level?

14:12.252 --> 14:15.122
- Do you?
- Y-yes.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.599
Ugh, all right, come on.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.741
Wow, it's so...

14:34.774 --> 14:38.946
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh,
Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.548
Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.017
Morty, come on,
we're leaving for school.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.253
Oh, everything's crooked!
Reality is poison!

14:46.286 --> 14:48.021
I want to go back!
I hate this!

14:48.055 --> 14:49.389
What's his deal?
Can't live like this!

14:49.422 --> 14:51.024
Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty,
Morty, Morty.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.926
Go to school, Summer.
I'll go in Morty's memory

14:52.960 --> 14:54.361
and do a little...

14:54.394 --> 14:56.729
Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!

14:56.763 --> 14:58.131
Well?

14:58.165 --> 15:01.634
You seem to be in charge
of what I get to remember.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.802
Why?

15:02.835 --> 15:04.437
Good question.

15:04.471 --> 15:07.140
Morty, I need darkness to prime
these optical inductors.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.476
Hit the leftmost light switch
by the door for me.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.777
The left.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.719
Okay, lights on.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.091
So, did I just hear three
distinct light switch clicks?

15:24.124 --> 15:25.592
W-W-What do you mean?

15:25.625 --> 15:28.295
I feel like the three sounds
I heard could be explained

15:28.328 --> 15:30.930
by an initial erroneous flipping
of a switch on the right

15:30.964 --> 15:32.765
followed by a hasty,
corrective flipping

15:32.799 --> 15:34.401
of the requested switch.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.669
Then during the resultant
darkness and silence, a third,

15:36.703 --> 15:39.639
shameful unflipping of
the initially flipped switch.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.341
Is my assessment accurate?

15:41.374 --> 15:44.677
Yeah, that's... that's basically
how... how it all shaked out.

15:44.711 --> 15:45.912
I'm sorry.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.148
Ugh.
All right, come on.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.151
What?!
Come on!

16:03.796 --> 16:06.299
Grab a shovel.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.035
W-What is...

16:08.068 --> 16:10.437
Grab a shovel!

16:11.804 --> 16:13.406
What was that?

16:15.242 --> 16:18.211
I can't find a goddamn
zip tie anywhere!

16:18.245 --> 16:20.647
All right, fuck it!

16:25.252 --> 16:27.520
Ahh, zip tie.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.738
Why are you making me
do this for you again?

16:45.772 --> 16:48.308
Who doesn't wish they could
talk to animals, Rick?

16:48.341 --> 16:49.409
Most humans!

16:49.442 --> 16:51.511
There, I'm done,
just stay out of trouble!

16:52.912 --> 16:54.414
Gotta keep moving.
Can't stop.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.483
Up, down, down, up, up, up,
down, up, stop, down.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.518
The queen needs food.
The babies need food.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.653
The queen makes babies.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.189
The situation in Argentina

17:02.222 --> 17:03.890
has proven less convenient
than predicted.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.025
We'll have to re-destabilize
their economy,

17:06.059 --> 17:08.328
refocus labor class outrage
from upper to middle,

17:08.361 --> 17:10.762
foster a coup, and install
a compliant regime.

17:10.797 --> 17:11.931
Same as Guatemala?

17:11.964 --> 17:13.165
Yes, but you can double time it.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.601
We need a quorum
to pick a new pope,

17:14.634 --> 17:16.703
in case the Exxon/Monsanto thing
falls through in Africa.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.239
Why not use chemtrails?
Put a canopy on Uganda.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.241
They're set to agitate
any mo... What?

17:21.273 --> 17:23.009
That kid is watching us.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.178
So, we're squirrels, he's a kid.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.946
He's watching us like he hears
what we're saying.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.550
Hey, kid. Young man?
Come here, little boy.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.553
Tell Daphne to run a 199
on a possible Dolittle.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.721
Little boy!

17:34.754 --> 17:36.523
We'll give you wishes
if you can hear us!

17:36.556 --> 17:38.625
We can make you fly
and get candy.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.035
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Fuck me! Fuck me!

17:49.068 --> 17:51.404
Rick!

17:51.438 --> 17:53.806
Ah, shit, Morty,
what did you do?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.747
All right, Morty,
pack your shit!

18:00.780 --> 18:02.615
That's only gonna keep 'em down
for a little bit, Morty!

18:02.649 --> 18:04.151
You fucked with
squirrels, Morty!

18:04.184 --> 18:05.585
We got a good five minutes

18:05.618 --> 18:07.387
before they're backing up
on our ass, Morty!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.656
We have to pack up and move
to a new reality, Morty!

18:09.689 --> 18:12.058
You know I said we could
only do that a couple of times!

18:12.091 --> 18:15.328
We're fucked over here because
of these damn squirrels, Morty!

18:15.362 --> 18:17.330
I don't know what
my reaction is,

18:17.364 --> 18:19.499
but I think I'm mounting
in suspicion of you.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.602
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna remember everything!

18:22.635 --> 18:24.671
Everything!

18:31.378 --> 18:33.480
Yeah!

18:33.513 --> 18:37.484
**

18:37.517 --> 18:40.853
Ow!

18:40.887 --> 18:42.855
Ah!

18:42.889 --> 18:45.024
Ow!

18:46.826 --> 18:53.700
**

18:53.733 --> 18:55.502
Well, what'd you find out?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.604
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what
are you gonna do, kill me?

18:57.637 --> 19:00.373
No, I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill myself!

19:00.407 --> 19:02.275
All those memories just erased!

19:02.309 --> 19:04.377
Sitting in this room
collecting dust!

19:04.411 --> 19:07.347
W-What's the point of going on
if most of everything

19:07.380 --> 19:09.949
that happens just ends up
sitting in here?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.984
All right, kid.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.721
I don't know much aside from
the fact that "Men in Black 2"

19:14.754 --> 19:17.457
is a joyless cash grab, but I do
know that whatever you have

19:17.490 --> 19:19.892
brewing around in your noggin
really connected with you.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.394
I can't deny that,

19:21.428 --> 19:23.863
and I can't deny that I'm
inspired by your passion.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.565
I want in.
Suicide pact!

19:25.598 --> 19:27.534
Yes, yeah, let's do it!

19:27.567 --> 19:30.537
Together, you old son
of a bitch! On three!

19:30.570 --> 19:31.738
One...

19:31.771 --> 19:32.905
Two...

19:32.939 --> 19:35.742
You guys doing
Morty's Mind Blowers?

19:35.775 --> 19:37.744
Morty's Mind Blowers?

19:37.777 --> 19:40.247
Grandpa, is this scenario three?

19:40.280 --> 19:42.849
Uh, w-what's that,
and w-who are you?

19:42.882 --> 19:45.785
Oh, man, it's a scenario four.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.504
Ugh, fucking goddamn it!

20:04.537 --> 20:07.340
I don't get paid enough
for this shit!

20:07.374 --> 20:11.010
There's a Craftsman nearby.
I can smell it.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.045
Whoa, what... what...

20:13.079 --> 20:14.614
Can I help you?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.516
H-How did we fall asleep during
interdimensional cable?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.251
- Yeah, what the hell, Summer?
- Summer, you dumb bitch!

20:18.285 --> 20:19.952
How long were we out,
you dumb bitch!

20:19.986 --> 20:21.788
How much interdimensional cable
did we miss, you stupid bitch!

20:21.821 --> 20:23.890
How many improv TV shows with
commercials did we miss, Summer?

20:23.923 --> 20:25.692
Why did you let us fall asleep?
You dumb bitch!
You stupid bitch!

20:25.725 --> 20:27.294
All right, Morty,
fuck this noise.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.861
Let's get out of here
and go on a classic

20:28.895 --> 20:31.063
Rick and Morty adventure.
- Yeah, right, Rick, I'm all-in.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.965
No wonder you're
constantly fighting

20:32.999 --> 20:34.901
with each other
and behind schedule.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.603
What?
Nothing.

20:36.636 --> 20:44.636
**

20:46.646 --> 20:54.646
**

20:56.656 --> 21:03.830
**

21:03.863 --> 21:05.164
Rick?
Hello?

21:05.197 --> 21:06.899
Just here for my putter.

21:06.933 --> 21:10.136
Jerry's Mind Blowers?

21:10.169 --> 21:13.406
**

21:13.440 --> 21:15.675
Follow the boys!

21:15.708 --> 21:19.579
**

21:19.612 --> 21:21.414
We're charged and aimed
at Alpha Centauri,

21:21.448 --> 21:23.350
ready for transport.

21:23.383 --> 21:26.018
They fell for it!
Let's send Gobo home!

21:26.052 --> 21:27.454
All right!

21:27.487 --> 21:29.288
- Where's dad?
- He should be here any second.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.424
It's funny, Jerry spent his life
seeking attention,

21:31.458 --> 21:33.860
but in the end, humanity's
instinctive dismissal of him

21:33.893 --> 21:35.194
saved an alien's life.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.029
He knows where to go, right?

21:37.063 --> 21:38.931
Yep, any minute now.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.704
Did it work?
Did you guys get Gobo home?

21:44.737 --> 21:47.440
You have Gobo! You were supposed
to bring him to the hill!

21:47.474 --> 21:49.208
As if.
He was in your basket.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.977
He was in your car!

21:55.247 --> 21:56.449
Oh!

21:56.483 --> 21:58.685
Oof!
Dibs on his stuff.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.721
Did you get any of that?
