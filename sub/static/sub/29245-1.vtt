00:20.054 --> 00:22.054
-[DJ] <i> So, Ms. Bellow--</i>
-[Eryn] <i> No relation.</i>

00:22.056 --> 00:24.523
[DJ] <i> That was my first</i>
<i> question, beat me to it.</i>

00:24.525 --> 00:26.025
<i> Big reading you</i>
<i> have ahead of yourself</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:27.493
<i> -at Book Smart Downtown</i>
<i> later today?</i>

00:27.495 --> 00:30.162
[Eryn]
<i> Yeah, that is the sentence.</i>

00:30.164 --> 00:32.765
[DJ] <i> Well, I don't think it'll</i>
<i> be that bad. Book readings</i>
<i> aren't known to end</i>

00:32.767 --> 00:34.633
<i> with the audience</i>
<i> eating the author.</i>

00:34.635 --> 00:37.536
[Eryn] <i> Oh, [chuckles]</i>
<i> but I do like that visual.</i>

00:37.538 --> 00:40.606
<i> Someone trying to appease</i>
<i> a room full of cannibals</i>
<i> with chick lit.</i>

00:40.608 --> 00:43.075
<i> I mean, I can't say that's</i>
<i> the best category or</i>
<i> the strongest genre to tackle</i>

00:43.077 --> 00:48.113
<i> -that sort of room, but...</i>
-[DJ] <i> Well, if not chick lit,</i>

00:48.115 --> 00:51.250
<i> what genre do</i>
<i> you consider yourself?</i>

00:51.252 --> 00:53.352
[Eryn] <i> I don't know, I guess</i>
<i> I don't like to be tied down.</i>

00:53.354 --> 00:56.422
<i> Categories are for</i>
<i> agents and bookstores</i>

00:56.424 --> 00:58.457
<i> as a shortcut when your job</i>
<i> is selling books all day long.</i>

00:58.459 --> 01:00.059
[Carrie laughing]

01:00.061 --> 01:02.261
<i> You know,</i>
<i> readers alphabeticalize.</i>

01:02.263 --> 01:03.796
<i> We look at books differently.</i>

01:03.798 --> 01:07.266
<i> They influence and</i>
<i> authors end up pigeonholed.</i>

01:07.268 --> 01:10.069
<i> I mean the moral of the story</i>
<i> is the good life is</i>
<i> reserved for the readers.</i>

01:10.071 --> 01:12.571
<i> Explore the store,</i>
<i> have fun, be curious.</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:15.607
[DJ] <i> Uh huh,</i>
<i> so is irony your favorite?</i>

01:15.609 --> 01:18.777
[Eryn] <i> Well, the madness is,</i>
<i> in today's world,</i>
<i> no one can know anymore.</i>

01:18.779 --> 01:20.846
[Eryn laughs maniacally]

01:20.848 --> 01:23.082
-Seriously?
-[DJ] <i> Well, what you say--</i>

01:23.084 --> 01:24.483
It sounds like
you're having a meltdown.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.851
If you let them
think you're crazy,

01:25.853 --> 01:27.586
they're going to
think that I'm crazy.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.321
And if I'm crazy,
I can't help you.

01:29.323 --> 01:32.424
I can't even help me myself
and we both lose.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.826
-Whoa!
-[tires screeching]

01:33.828 --> 01:36.795
What the-- What was that about?

01:36.797 --> 01:38.664
[DJ]
<i> Well, that sounds like work.</i>

01:38.666 --> 01:40.599
[Eryn] <i> It's less</i>
<i> work than social media.</i>

01:40.601 --> 01:44.837
<i> I mean, Facebook, Instagram,</i>
<i> Twitter, those are work.</i>

01:44.839 --> 01:48.373
<i> But if people scroll</i>
<i> and scroll all day long,</i>

01:48.375 --> 01:50.375
<i> I mean even when they're</i>
<i>in movies that they paid to see</i>

01:50.377 --> 01:51.777
<i> or with people that they love,</i>

01:51.779 --> 01:53.278
<i> it's like get off your phones!</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:57.249
<i> If we had a way to</i>
<i> track how many words</i>
<i> people read on average today,</i>

01:57.251 --> 01:59.384
<i> I bet you it's more than</i>
<i> War and Peace cover to cover</i>

01:59.386 --> 02:01.620
<i> worth of scrolling every year.</i>

02:01.622 --> 02:05.624
<i> Which, you know,</i>
<i> when you think about it,</i>
<i>it's actually really impressive.</i>

02:05.626 --> 02:10.596
<i> You hand someone a</i>
<i> 1,000 or a 1,300-page book,</i>
<i> tell them to take a year,</i>

02:10.598 --> 02:13.232
<i> for some reason,</i>
<i> they get scared.</i>

02:13.234 --> 02:15.767
<i> It only works out to about</i>
<i> five pages a day, by the way.</i>

02:15.769 --> 02:18.270
[DJ] <i> But people read</i>
<i> 280 characters at a time.</i>

02:18.272 --> 02:20.172
[Eryn] <i> Well, no,</i>
<i> read one sentence at a time.</i>

02:22.743 --> 02:28.680
So I said to him
post-postmodernism is so over.
Come on, tricks are for kids.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.550
-Can you write something
truthful for God sakes?
-[Eryn laughing]

02:34.421 --> 02:37.789
Also, and I'm going to have
to use some pictures from you.
I got to give something

02:37.791 --> 02:41.560
to the publisher.
Nobody's writing blank
million dollar checks anymore.

02:41.929 --> 02:45.197
-[phone buzzing]
-Oh, I'm sorry, do you mind?

02:45.199 --> 02:47.900
No, not at all.
I'm just going to be down there.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.868
-Okay, okay.
-[soft classical music]

02:49.870 --> 02:51.503
Carrie here.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.839
No, you listen to me first!

02:53.841 --> 02:57.910
My client said he hates fucking
three of them, his words!

02:58.612 --> 03:02.281
Well, did your
stupid artist even read

03:02.283 --> 03:04.683
what the title of the book is?

03:04.685 --> 03:07.953
No, no, no, no,
he's done this before to me!

03:08.455 --> 03:10.689
When I see him, I'm going
to personally strangle him.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.193
Oh, so I'll
strangle his attorney, too.

03:19.900 --> 03:24.203
[joyful music]

03:55.502 --> 03:58.303
[librarian]
Oh, that's a fun one.

03:58.305 --> 04:01.340
Written in high school,
published years later.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.808
Pretty pure stuff.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.477
They went no picture.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.246
And it didn't matter,
still did well.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.948
Better when that happens.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.684
Did you like it?

04:14.255 --> 04:15.821
It's an authentic debut.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.257
We'll see when the
next one shows up here.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.492
They all do.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.928
You make this place
sound like it's a pound.

04:23.964 --> 04:28.900
Well, some do tend to get
adopted quicker than others.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.503
[Eryn chuckles]

04:32.306 --> 04:33.605
Thank you.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.713
[people chattering]

04:41.715 --> 04:43.482
[Carrie]
I don't like that cover.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.750
It's all wrong!

04:46.320 --> 04:47.452
Why?

04:47.454 --> 04:50.355
Because [laughs] it appears

04:50.357 --> 04:52.057
as if you're
trying to overcompensate

04:52.059 --> 04:55.427
for the sentences and the book
-deserves better than that.

04:55.429 --> 04:58.597
[Rand] <i> Hey, listen I usually</i>
<i> only check voicemail twice</i>
<i> a day when taking a dump</i>

04:58.599 --> 05:00.999
<i> on a good day.</i>
<i> If you think I'm an animal,</i>

05:01.001 --> 05:05.070
<i> you're the one still</i>
<i> leaving me voicemail, text.</i>

05:07.007 --> 05:11.443
Hey, you know what?
I think we got a bestseller!

05:11.445 --> 05:13.812
Well, they haven't read it yet
and half of them
haven't even bought it yet, so.

05:13.814 --> 05:17.916
All right, so can you
please be in the moment

05:17.918 --> 05:21.720
and appreciate how
special this all is?

05:21.722 --> 05:24.022
Just try and put
on your happy face.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.892
-Turn the frown upside down.
-Mm-hmm [chuckles].

05:26.894 --> 05:31.797
And, also, do not talk anyone
out of buying the book.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.365
-I know, I know.
-Thank you, thank you.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.001
[crowd applauding]

05:37.471 --> 05:39.371
Hi, there.
Actually super disappointed

05:39.373 --> 05:41.573
this mic doesn't
have any feedback on it.

05:41.575 --> 05:42.974
Going to have to
break the ice myself now.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.609
[crowd laughing]

05:45.913 --> 05:50.082
So, guess this is what
an AA meeting feels like.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.750
[crowd laughing]

05:53.120 --> 05:54.886
I'm Eryn Bellow.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.955
I've been in
sentence construction

05:56.957 --> 05:59.691
for over a decade now.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.395
I hope this adds something.

06:07.935 --> 06:11.036
-Hey, I really love
what you wrote.
-Oh, thanks.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.506
But do you get some kind of
thrill out of trying to
hurt us with the story?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.376
Um...

06:17.378 --> 06:20.145
I'm asking out here because
I figured you wouldn't want me

06:20.147 --> 06:23.415
-to ask in there with everyone.
-Right.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.617
Well,
it's not being done at you.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.686
I guess, I thought we were

06:27.688 --> 06:29.521
just trying to work
on something together.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.656
[Carrie] Eryn, come on, come on!

06:32.593 --> 06:35.160
If you don't like it,
you can walk away, right?

06:35.162 --> 06:37.562
But thank you for coming.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.399
[soft upbeat music]

07:02.022 --> 07:04.022
Thank you. [sighs]

07:04.024 --> 07:05.957
Sweetie,
just wanted to tell you,

07:05.959 --> 07:08.126
you were great, great today!

07:08.128 --> 07:10.162
No, no, no, I just,
I thought were you coming.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.064
Oh, no, you know,
I have this [stutters]

07:13.066 --> 07:16.001
such a boring dinner with
my boss and the three amigos.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.437
You can come, welcome to join.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.872
No, I'm good.

07:20.874 --> 07:21.973
-[chuckles]
-Smart you.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.645
[phone ringing]

07:29.183 --> 07:31.683
-Hi.
-[Eryn] <i> Hi.</i>

07:31.685 --> 07:33.952
-How you doing?
-[Eryn] <i> Tired, long day.</i>

07:33.954 --> 07:36.988
Yeah, tell me about it.
How'd it go?

07:36.990 --> 07:39.124
-[Eryn] <i> It was good.</i>
-Yeah, what'd you read?

07:40.093 --> 07:41.526
Same old.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.829
Good old Misnomer, the rant

07:43.831 --> 07:45.630
about words
bouncing off their target.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.099
[chuckles] Yeah,
at least when code doesn't work,

07:48.101 --> 07:50.202
I get instant
feedback when the app crashes.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.137
<i> God, that sounds so good.</i>

07:52.139 --> 07:54.172
<i> I get it down and then</i>
<i> I've got to wait ten years</i>

07:54.174 --> 07:55.707
<i> to see if it mattered.</i>

07:55.709 --> 07:57.075
Not if you win a Pulitzer.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.578
Right,
name the last five winners.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.246
<i> Anyway, listen.</i>

08:01.248 --> 08:03.815
There's a reason that I
wanted to video chat with you.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.217
Oh, yeah?

08:05.219 --> 08:06.952
Well, look
what I was just eyeing.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.955
<i> Keli Onherback romp</i>
<i> is not Kosher, yowza!</i>

08:09.957 --> 08:12.724
Oh, all right, yeah.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.826
<i> I don't know if,</i>
<i> uh, hey, I don't know</i>

08:14.828 --> 08:16.495
<i> if that's funny or offensive.</i>

08:16.497 --> 08:17.662
Anyways.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.564
<i> Yeah, anyway.</i>

08:19.566 --> 08:24.836
I, seriously,
I want you to say hi to Lacey.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.072
-What?
<i>-Now, hear me out. Hear me out.</i>

08:27.074 --> 08:29.241
-What is, what is
she doing there?
-She showed up here.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.943
I told her right away
that I was completely
uncomfortable with it.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.647
<i> -Yeah, yeah, me, too.</i>
-See, the thing is that's why

08:35.649 --> 08:38.216
I was putting this all out
in the open because I don't
want you to think that

08:38.217 --> 08:40.652
I'm hiding anything
because there's
nothing to hide here.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.520
<i> Wait, so why are you</i>
<i> saying all that like that?</i>

08:42.523 --> 08:45.190
[Rand] <i> Because she showed up.</i>
<i> She wanted to talk.</i>

08:45.192 --> 08:47.025
-About?
-Not about that.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.160
<i> About moving, missing us.</i>

08:49.763 --> 08:51.530
About how we made a mistake?

08:52.633 --> 08:53.732
Maybe.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.735
Why didn't you answer
when I called earlier?

08:56.737 --> 08:58.637
Because we were talking.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.739
[-Eryn] Right,
I want to talk to her.
-Yeah, good.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.741
That's why I wanted
to video chat with you

09:02.743 --> 09:05.744
because that way
you can just go ahead

09:05.746 --> 09:08.079
and say whatever,
say whatever, say whatever

09:08.081 --> 09:09.915
you want to say.

09:09.917 --> 09:10.849
Here.

09:11.952 --> 09:12.951
Hi, Eryn.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.819
Hi.

09:15.622 --> 09:19.024
-You okay?
-Yeah. No, yeah, I'm good.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.059
It's just, it's been rough.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.861
[chuckles]

09:22.863 --> 09:25.664
Yeah, are you drinking a beer?

09:26.833 --> 09:32.270
-Yeah.
-So, what you just popped by?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.307
I don't think I'm going
to be here when you get back.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.310
Right, well,
I have a meeting tomorrow,

09:38.312 --> 09:41.112
but I should be
back in a day or two.

09:41.114 --> 09:45.216
No, well, with the way
they've been flying you around.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.819
Look, you're moving, Lacey.
No one's dying.

09:47.821 --> 09:51.957
-Yeah, I know. I'm just,
I don't know.
-[beer sloshing]

09:51.959 --> 09:54.859
Anyway, I got to head out.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.362
[gentle music]

10:02.102 --> 10:04.102
Okay, let me call you back?

10:04.104 --> 10:06.104
Wait, what, why?

10:06.840 --> 10:08.239
Well, what, you want me
to put you on the windowsill,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.375
so you can watch her out?

10:11.778 --> 10:12.911
Fine, call me back.

10:12.913 --> 10:13.845
Okay.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.783
[siren faintly wailing]

10:27.728 --> 10:30.662
-[phone ringing]
-[Eryn grunting]

10:30.664 --> 10:31.730
Shit!

10:34.735 --> 10:35.400
Hello?

10:35.402 --> 10:38.136
[gentle music]

10:40.641 --> 10:42.774
I'll be down in a minute.

10:45.979 --> 10:46.911
Oh, God.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.218
[Eryn grunting]

11:03.830 --> 11:06.264
So just tell him
to go fuck himself.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.734
And then when he realizes
I don't like fucking myself,

11:09.736 --> 11:10.969
I want you to do it for me,

11:10.971 --> 11:13.371
then, you will get Theo back.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.939
Do it!

11:14.941 --> 11:16.808
-This is all day.
-God.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.344
[lively music]

11:24.151 --> 11:25.083
Okay.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.953
[Carrie] All right.

11:28.955 --> 11:29.988
What is this?

11:29.990 --> 11:32.323
Oh, it's a hangover cure.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.792
The best, the best.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.126
Hi, there, the usual.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.361
-[blender whirring]
-[knife clacking]

11:36.363 --> 11:38.063
-[ice clattering]
-[fruit plopping]

11:38.065 --> 11:40.131
[blender whirring]

11:40.133 --> 11:42.233
-Here.
-I just need a macchiato.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.703
No, no, this is much better.
It's a plant-based straw,

11:44.705 --> 11:46.438
and I'll take the usual, too.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.873
[moving to upbeat music]

11:53.013 --> 11:54.245
[elevator bell ringing]

11:54.247 --> 11:56.014
I don't know,
should I be worried?

11:56.016 --> 11:59.150
I mean, is this some
kind of a drinking problem?

11:59.152 --> 12:00.885
[Eryn] Nnn nnn.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.887
-Hi, good morning.
-Yes, hi.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.355
Yes, I'm here with Eryn.

12:05.158 --> 12:08.193
Uh... Yes,
I have you here, Mrs.?

12:08.195 --> 12:09.427
Yes, yes.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.929
Mrs. Yes, right.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.965
Mr. Williams is
telling me that we need to wait

12:13.967 --> 12:15.400
until Ms. Freeman is ready.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.368
Oh, how long
is that going to be?

12:17.370 --> 12:20.138
She's usually 10 minutes behind.
-[Carrie scoffs]

12:20.140 --> 12:22.373
You know what?
That is actually probably
going to be better for us

12:22.375 --> 12:26.311
'cause I, it's like a
literal ball and chain.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.481
Shame, shame!

12:34.020 --> 12:37.322
-[Eryn sighs]
-Are you going to be
okay for this meeting?

12:37.324 --> 12:38.823
Please don't yell at me.

12:38.825 --> 12:43.995
-[office staff chattering]
-[phones ringing]

12:43.997 --> 12:45.430
[Gregg]
Hey, Carrie, we're ready.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.099
Doubtful.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.236
Hi, Eryn, I'm Gregg.

12:51.238 --> 12:54.539
Okay. [sighs]

12:54.541 --> 12:56.775
[Ms. Freeman] So, Eryn,
congratulations on your novel.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.409
I love where it took me.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.979
Such a departure
from your debut.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.348
And I want to thank
you both for coming here
and making time for us

13:03.350 --> 13:06.184
because I know that
you're at the end of your trip.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.086
And, a little birdie
told me that you had been

13:08.088 --> 13:10.288
taking other
production meetings thus far,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.490
so I know that you
have choices, options.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.960
I also heard
something about a series?

13:15.962 --> 13:18.429
Yes, well,
that's why we're interested

13:18.431 --> 13:21.032
in hearing what
you all have to say

13:21.034 --> 13:23.868
because I'm interested
in getting on with lunch.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.237
Lunch? Oh, well,
who are you lunching with?

13:26.873 --> 13:28.439
With Eryn.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.141
[Ms. Freeman] Ah!

13:30.143 --> 13:32.076
-Probably not eating.
-86 it.

13:32.312 --> 13:36.181
We're thinking of
Cruise for the lead.

13:36.183 --> 13:40.318
-But the antagonist is 25.
-[Eryn coughing]

13:40.320 --> 13:43.087
I happen to know Tom Cruise
very well and I think if
he wants to do it,

13:43.089 --> 13:48.159
-we can age him down.
-Hmm, so it wouldn't be
the character that changes.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.061
It would be the actor.

13:50.063 --> 13:53.364
Having him play 25 again
would be a great press move

13:53.366 --> 13:55.500
and I think it would
up the value of the project

13:55.502 --> 13:57.235
to twofold if not more.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.938
[Carrie] Mmm hmm, mmm hmm.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.173
-Wait, who's that?
-[phone vibrates]

14:02.175 --> 14:03.374
-It's me!
-[Eryn shrieks]

14:03.376 --> 14:06.244
Hey! Down, sit down!

14:06.246 --> 14:09.080
You wanted me to give
her the risky business, right?

14:09.082 --> 14:12.050
-Did we offend her?
-No, no, no.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.019
She's just a
little under the weather.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.122
But I'm sure that
she'll feel much better

14:18.124 --> 14:20.892
if you can get your
offer into the mid-sixes.

14:20.894 --> 14:21.960
-[Gregg laughing]
-[Ms. Freeman coughs]

14:21.962 --> 14:23.394
So, I'll be off.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.163
Good day.

14:25.165 --> 14:29.267
-Fire that little brat!
-You're fired.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.903
[birds chirping]

14:34.908 --> 14:36.975
This is so good.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.177
-How do you know?
-How do I know?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.412
That bottle cost a hundred
bucks, that's how I know.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.348
[Eryn chuckles]

14:43.350 --> 14:45.516
Mmm, oh!

14:46.987 --> 14:49.621
Now, they told me that you
opted out for tomorrow's meeting

14:49.623 --> 14:51.623
because you want to
take the red-eye home?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.057
Yeah, I feel like you
don't need my help picking

14:53.059 --> 14:54.592
who's going to
fuck it up the least.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.327
Well, you got that right.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.662
I got stuff I
got to get home to.

14:57.664 --> 15:01.566
-Writing?
-Maybe.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.936
Come on now, you know, I don't
want to be a pain in the ass,

15:04.938 --> 15:07.272
but there is a
deadline on the horizon

15:07.274 --> 15:10.208
-and I know I
don't need to remind you.
-Yeah, no, I know, I know.

15:10.210 --> 15:14.178
I just, I've got some
ideas that I'm noodling.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.282
Oh, good, good!

15:17.284 --> 15:19.017
-Good, good, good, what?
-Yeah.

15:20.186 --> 15:23.054
I'm still working on them,
so I don't want to--

15:23.056 --> 15:24.555
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.492
You can tell me,
friend to friend.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.931
Okay,
so I'm thinking it's a sci-fi

15:32.933 --> 15:35.199
set in the '90s with rap music.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.968
-Oh, no.
-[Eryn] What?

15:36.970 --> 15:39.203
-No, no, no.
-No, why?

15:39.205 --> 15:41.639
No, because
historical sci-fi doesn't work

15:41.641 --> 15:43.374
unless you
happen to be steampunk.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.510
Wait, so we
call this gangster-steam.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.979
Nobody reads steampunk

15:47.981 --> 15:50.581
except for the few
people that read steampunk.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.083
Okay.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.118
No, it's not okay.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.354
The publisher offered you

15:56.356 --> 15:58.589
mid-six figures advance.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.960
That tells you that
they want a lot of people

16:01.962 --> 16:05.396
to read your books,
not just those people.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.432
What do you mean those people?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.466
What do you mean,
what do you mean?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.467
You know what I mean.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.969
It's such a small demographic.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.637
It's a niche demographic.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.372
-That's a thing!
-Niche, shmiche.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.274
Okay, it's a road trip story.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.009
Two best friends
are going to Argentina,

16:18.011 --> 16:19.711
except they can't
go to the next country

16:19.713 --> 16:21.546
until they have sex with someone
in the country that they're in.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.015
It's Country Country, Bang Bang!

16:24.017 --> 16:25.083
Oh, I don't know.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.518
Come up with something else.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.355
That doesn't
singe me like that dress.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.623
Sibling rivalry drama,
brother and sister.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.993
They're both in
love with the same girl.

16:34.995 --> 16:39.464
Believe it or not, I heard
a very similar pitch last week.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.632
-What?
-Same snatch, different day.

16:41.634 --> 16:45.269
How about this?
A coalition of religious leaders
discovers the cure to cancer

16:45.271 --> 16:46.771
which reinstores
value in modern faith

16:46.773 --> 16:49.207
only to reveal the
science behind the coalition.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.276
I got Tiger Portal to move up,
so you should stay
'til tomorrow.

16:52.278 --> 16:55.313
-[scoffs] What, you
didn't like those guys today?
-We could get more.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.749
Well, what about a remake?

16:57.751 --> 17:00.651
That goes fast and then
you won't get writer's block.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.153
Yeah, especially
if I'm plagiarizing.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.255
No, we wouldn't do it like that.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.557
I just want
something that's quick.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.127
Something honest,
something truthful.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.229
Well, I need to have something
that I feel like
is worth the paper.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.131
It's not being printed.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.066
-It's on digital.
-Oh, my God!

17:15.068 --> 17:16.534
It's like an
old-fashioned detective story,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.736
but the detective is an amnesiac

17:18.738 --> 17:21.271
and the criminal has
a photographic memory.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.340
You know,
there is a Swedish fairy tale

17:23.343 --> 17:24.709
that I've always loved,

17:24.711 --> 17:26.611
The Prince Without a Shadow.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.547
We want something
that people actually know.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.049
People know fairy tales.

17:31.051 --> 17:34.419
Not Swedish ones, honey,
not even the Swedes.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.387
The poster had
nothing to do with the story.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.057
Well, at least they
knew chartreuse was green.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.359
The Salem witch trials,

17:42.562 --> 17:45.430
but set in modern day.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.198
Why don't you do a memoir?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.167
-That's a good idea.
-What, no!

17:49.169 --> 17:50.535
'Cause then you could
write about what you know.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.070
I'm not even 30, that's stupid.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.172
And they want to
sell it in the US.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.240
Nobody here is
going to want a fairy tale

17:56.242 --> 17:59.077
that doesn't
have a happy ending.
You can thank Disney for that.

17:59.079 --> 18:02.647
What about a bunch
of girls, all tweens--

18:03.483 --> 18:08.319
No, I hate it.
I haven't even heard it
and I hate it.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.456
[Carrie] Well, that's all I had.
I thought you'd
come up with the rest.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.625
-A remake is a chance
to set the record straight.
-Pass.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.761
-Why?
-Because it's not what they
want.

18:16.763 --> 18:20.331
-Well, what do they want?
-They want something
that they already like.

18:20.333 --> 18:24.702
-Oh, my...
-You don't want to wait until
somebody salacious comes along

18:24.704 --> 18:26.637
and writes his
own version of it.

18:26.639 --> 18:30.274
And you know that they will, and
they always make money at it.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.611
There's used bookstores just
filled with whole sections
of that crap.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.115
-Memoir, it's terrifying
no matter who writes it.
-Thank you.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.183
-Here's your macchiato.
-It's probably better
it's not me.

18:39.185 --> 18:42.220
[phone clicking]

18:51.431 --> 18:54.165
I'm always struck
by that responsibility

18:54.167 --> 18:57.168
that the writer has
because they have such power

18:57.170 --> 18:58.603
and, as we know,
with great power

18:58.605 --> 19:00.872
-comes great responsibility.
-[Gwen] Yes, indeed.

19:00.874 --> 19:03.608
You have the power
to determine the fates

19:03.610 --> 19:06.244
of everyone in this world
that you've created.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.380
It is the power that we
all lack in our own universe,

19:09.382 --> 19:11.682
but the writer completely
controls in his universe.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.153
[plane engine whirring]

19:16.422 --> 19:19.190

[Eryn sighs]

20:21.621 --> 20:22.887
Oh, you look so good.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.555
Thank you, so do you.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.659
[sighs] Wow, it's been a while.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.594
Yeah.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.263
Thank you.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.764
It certainly feels like it.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.900
[people chattering]

20:35.902 --> 20:37.868
-So..
-So?

20:37.870 --> 20:40.471
-Are they going to adapt it?
-Um...

20:40.773 --> 20:43.407
I don't know, I guess
I'd prefer that they didn't.

20:43.409 --> 20:47.011
Oh, come on, what about the
fatty check that'll pay off the
new house before escrow closes?

20:47.814 --> 20:50.348
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm
going to go through with that.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.385
I thought you said your bungalow
wasn't big enough
for the two of you?

20:59.559 --> 21:01.025
Are you guys breaking up?

21:02.462 --> 21:03.394
Are--

21:06.532 --> 21:07.999
Did you guys sleep
together the other night?

21:08.001 --> 21:09.033
No.

21:12.605 --> 21:16.340
No, I just wanted to
say goodbye in person.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.444
I didn't know I'm not allowed
over unless you're home now.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.412
-It's not that.
-You know what?

21:21.414 --> 21:23.681
Maybe you were right.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.583
Sleeping together was a mistake.

21:28.354 --> 21:31.789
Yeah, I just thought
maybe they'll get it out of
their system while I'm around.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.825
And now I'm moving.

21:35.795 --> 21:36.794
So what?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.397
So you won't have to worry.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.889
So you're seriously
you're not going to believe me?

24:19.492 --> 24:22.226
Eryn, we didn't do anything.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.929
I just need you to help me
pack my stuff in the morning.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.634
I mean, could you at
least go sleep on the bed?

24:30.636 --> 24:31.836
No, I can't.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.650
Well, now you don't
have to get rid of this place.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.052
I always gonna miss it.

24:49.121 --> 24:52.189
I don't know how you
could be so illogical!

That's probably
not the right word.

Um, fine,
I will take one of these.

-So?

30:35.835 --> 30:37.000
[Carrie] There's nine pages.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.836
-Yeah.
-That's it?

30:38.838 --> 30:40.404
I just wanted you to get an idea

30:40.406 --> 30:41.572
of what track I was on.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.974
-So, there's no more?

30:43.976 --> 30:46.043

-Just good?

30:46.045 --> 30:48.178
No, the pages suck, honey.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.080
Well, I thought you
wanted me to write a memoir?

30:50.583 --> 30:52.850
It's so depressing.

30:52.852 --> 30:53.984
Thank you.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.419
[Carrie] <i> Sorry.</i>

30:55.421 --> 30:57.988
I mean,
it's a little bit embellished.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.224
Look, you can't
purposely set out

31:00.226 --> 31:02.526
to write a fake memoir.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.394
Well, at least I'm
being upfront about it.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.029
It's like I dare you
to find the truth in it.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.365
Okay, you know what,
forget the memoir.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.033
I'll get a biographer.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.635
You'll have full approval,

31:11.637 --> 31:14.872
-and profit participation.
-What?

31:14.874 --> 31:18.175
Sweetie, you got
to get used to the idea
that you're a public figure.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.978
-You're a brand,
people know you.
-Are you telling me

31:20.980 --> 31:23.380
the only thing you don't
want me to write about is me?

31:23.616 --> 31:26.984
Yes. No fake memoirs.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.119
No Nordic fairy tales.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.387
No gangster-punk.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.456
Something else, fast!

31:32.458 --> 31:35.058
The publishers
are waiting for pages.

31:35.060 --> 31:39.229
And if they don't get them soon,
they're going to sit their asses
down and write you a letter

31:39.231 --> 31:42.399
in the language that
they love most, legalese.

what's on the inside,

That's why I love you.

We'll be
discussing a number of topics

readership going up,

32:35.187 --> 32:36.520
the return of long form.

something we were discussing

32:39.291 --> 32:42.426
before we started recording
and I said, Theo, hold on.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.293
This is good stuff.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.628
Save it for the podcast.

-Nana.
-You should be.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.101
-Well, so should you.
-I am.

32:51.103 --> 32:53.470
And if you were around more,
you'd know that.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.539
[phone vibrating]

32:56.675 --> 32:58.575
It's much better for me

32:58.577 --> 33:01.078
to talk about my
great grandkids than it is

33:01.080 --> 33:03.613
to listen to somebody
else talk about their uncle.

33:03.615 --> 33:04.548
Nana.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.584
You need to visit more.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.386
I have, like, zero time.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.355
You make of time what you want.

33:11.357 --> 33:15.158
And if you don't
make time, young lady,

33:15.160 --> 33:17.995
I'm going to tell
this journalist, or whoever,

33:17.997 --> 33:20.597
that you were
selling drugs in high school.

33:22.434 --> 33:23.367
Don't you dare.

33:23.369 --> 33:24.468
[laughing]

33:24.470 --> 33:26.003
Don't you dare.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.404
So, a few minutes ago,
you were espousing

33:27.406 --> 33:30.273
on a new theory on
young adult readers?

33:30.275 --> 33:32.509
Yes. Who are they,
these young adults?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.344
It's code for easy.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.246
Adults get to feel young again

33:36.248 --> 33:38.482
and the young get a
taste of the sourness

33:38.484 --> 33:40.317
that awaits them as adults.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.719
It's easy,
moves fast, and no big words.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.422
Well, I got news for you,
pizza can be great,

33:45.424 --> 33:49.426
-but they don't award
Michelin stars to pizzerias.
-[Will] No.

33:49.428 --> 33:52.162
[Theo] Simply because it will
never be the greatest
meal in the world.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.398
And what about Eryn Bellow?

33:54.400 --> 33:55.432
Well, who gives a shit?

33:55.434 --> 33:57.567
[Will] [chuckles] Wait, why?

33:57.569 --> 33:59.336
[Theo] Well, she's inauthentic.

33:59.338 --> 34:02.606
She's trying to
decode and decipher our world

34:02.608 --> 34:05.409
from the position of
a quarter-life crisis.

34:05.411 --> 34:08.210
That her publishers
sell her on her last name

34:08.213 --> 34:10.112
where like she's in
the category of O'Conner,

34:10.114 --> 34:11.748
or a little Rand.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.283
Well, pardon me,
but I'm not buying.

34:13.284 --> 34:14.650
[Will] Why?

34:14.652 --> 34:16.652
[Theo] [sighs] Well,
she's about as erudite

34:16.655 --> 34:19.255
as my five-year-old
showing off her new dive,

34:19.257 --> 34:21.757
but unlike my child,
she doesn't belly flop.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.261
She misses the goddamn pool.

34:24.263 --> 34:27.697
And the concrete is hard
especially from those heights.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.533
What are you looking at me
like that for? What, what--

34:29.534 --> 34:34.438
-That doesn't seem fair.
-What's the worst that's going
to happen to her, a concussion?

34:35.306 --> 34:39.476
She'll live, hopefully
with enough amnesia
to forget writing.

Well, hello to you, too.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.299
It's earlier here.

35:02.301 --> 35:03.300
I'm allowed to be cranky.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.734
Are you okay?

35:05.304 --> 35:07.437
Yeah, no,
there's a really nice soft bush

35:07.439 --> 35:09.272
outside the window
of my one-story balcony.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.141
I don't own any rope,
and I don't cook enough

35:11.143 --> 35:12.375
to keep my knives sharp, so--

35:12.377 --> 35:13.844
All right, listen, you got to go

35:13.846 --> 35:17.647
-to Los Angeles right away.
-Why?

35:17.649 --> 35:21.384
-Because I booked you
on Perspective.
-Why?

35:21.386 --> 35:24.688
Because I want you
to shut those critics up

35:24.690 --> 35:26.456
and I want you
to set it straight

35:26.458 --> 35:28.758
and tell everybody your story.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.760
Now, you'll be
flying on my expense account.

35:30.762 --> 35:33.130
While you're at it,
my husband never shuts up

35:33.132 --> 35:35.799
about this
Korean-Persian restaurant.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.634
I said it's Asian fusion.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.169
It's not the [indistinct]
of course,

35:39.171 --> 35:41.705

35:45.377 --> 35:46.510
Fine.

36:52.844 --> 36:55.812
Oh, she's my
favorite designer, British.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.447
Oh, on set.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.715
Hey, Jessica.

36:59.518 --> 37:00.483
You look amazing.

37:00.485 --> 37:01.785
Oh, it's so good to see you.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.253
Good to see you, too.

37:03.255 --> 37:06.656
-You know, I loved <i> Misnomer.</i>
-Oh.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.426
Incredible length. How did you
get all that in there?

37:09.428 --> 37:13.430
Thank you so much.
That means the world
to be coming from you.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.566
I tore through <i> Trophy Life.</i>
I mean, I finished it in the
middle of the night.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.335
Caffeine did not even
cross my mind once.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.770
Oh, my God. The faster you turn
them, the happier they are.

37:20.772 --> 37:24.674
You know, I just get afraid
for when the page scrolling
metrics start shoving up,

37:24.676 --> 37:26.977
-tracking how fast
people scroll.
-Right?

37:26.979 --> 37:28.945
They'll throw
that back in our faces.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.648
So-and-so gets them to read
them at 400 words per minute.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.416
[Eryn] Yeah, so no big words.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.485
And just a list of actions.
[laughs]

37:35.487 --> 37:37.554
I mean, I, for one, would love
it if you did some sort of,

37:37.556 --> 37:39.289
like, cool,
mass market paperback.

37:39.291 --> 37:40.490
I do love it when a book

37:40.492 --> 37:41.891
can fit into my back pocket.

37:41.893 --> 37:42.892
Right, I love that.

37:42.894 --> 37:43.994
So good to see you.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.595
[Eryn] So good to see you, too.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.497
Thank you so much
for coming on the show.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.399
We never thought
we could get you on.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.700
Pleasure to meet you in person.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.636
Put a face to the page proofs.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.838
Oh, I never realize you
you covered that genre.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.340
I've been doing
literary for years.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.776
All right,
shall we all be seated, yes?

38:01.446 --> 38:02.812
[static buzzing]

38:03.715 --> 38:05.615
[TV announcer]
<i> What famous singer is on...</i>

38:05.617 --> 38:07.317
[Nana grunting]

38:07.319 --> 38:08.685
[announcer mumbling]

38:10.489 --> 38:11.788
<i> She was so pleasant, pleasant.</i>

38:11.790 --> 38:13.390
[Nana clapping]

38:13.392 --> 38:15.292
Please hurry,
please, please hurry.

38:15.994 --> 38:19.696
[studio crew]
<i> And three, two, one.</i>

38:19.998 --> 38:23.967
Good evening and welcome
to <i> The Writer Perspective.</i>
I'm your host, Gwen Ginsberg.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.703
-I can't keep--
-Excuse me, Carrie,
clients are on.

38:26.705 --> 38:30.073
All right.
Can you please do something?

38:30.075 --> 38:32.776
Joining me on the stage,
Jessica Morrison.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.611
Most famous for <i> Writes A Wrong,</i>

38:34.613 --> 38:36.513
but most recently,<i> Trophy Life.</i>

38:37.382 --> 38:38.581
[Gwen] And then--

38:38.583 --> 38:39.449
[Nana sighs]

38:39.451 --> 38:40.817
[Gwen mumbling]

38:40.819 --> 38:43.086
And author and screenwriter

38:43.088 --> 38:45.622
of <i> Everyone Loves</i>
<i> Buffoons,</i> Theo Mencken.

38:45.624 --> 38:49.092
And of course,
we are very lucky and grateful

38:49.094 --> 38:53.730
to have her, a very rare
public appearance, Eryn Bellow

38:53.732 --> 38:55.465
who is going to
get my first question.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.668
<i> Why Chartreuse?</i>

38:58.670 --> 38:59.903
[scoffs] Still can't hear them.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.404
Oops, shh.

39:01.406 --> 39:03.506
Well, it is a pale
green French liqueur

39:03.508 --> 39:06.509
-made from 150 herbs.
-[laughs]

39:06.511 --> 39:08.044
It's like wheatgrass alcohol.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.946
[audience laughing]

39:09.948 --> 39:12.015
Well, not
what is it scientifically,

39:12.017 --> 39:15.552
but it's been over a year and
no one can agree on the title.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.420
-It's up to the reader.
-[Gwen] Oh.

39:17.422 --> 39:18.988
<i> -Like it's the first...</i>
-[drowned by Nana shouting].

39:18.990 --> 39:20.056
Oh, look at her!

39:20.058 --> 39:21.891
Oh, isn't she beautiful!

39:21.893 --> 39:24.527
Oh, oh, and look at those legs,
she looks terrific.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.129
-She looks good, right?
-She does.

39:26.131 --> 39:26.996
-No, she looks--
-Yes.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.598
That's my stylist.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.034
I mean, when I remember endings,

39:31.036 --> 39:33.770
I usually don't
remember the rest of the novel.

39:33.772 --> 39:37.707
And to me a novel is a journey,
it's not a result.

39:37.709 --> 39:41.444
And so if a book
doesn't end, but fades out,

39:42.547 --> 39:43.747
I don't know, it makes the stuff

39:43.749 --> 39:45.115
in the middle more important.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.818
-Risky.
-[Eryn chuckles]

39:48.820 --> 39:50.587
-So far so good.
-Yeah, look how

39:50.589 --> 39:51.588
-composed she is.
-Yeah.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.056
So, Ms. Queen of

39:53.058 --> 39:55.492
Suspense and Book Club Fiction.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.026
-Hate that.
-What, book clubs?

39:57.028 --> 40:00.630
No, sorry, I love that people
are reading it, it's just

40:00.632 --> 40:03.666
when it's categorized like that,
I mean, you don't need

40:03.668 --> 40:06.503
a support group to read it.
You just read it.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.138
Yeah, I mean,
it's not like it even paints it

40:08.140 --> 40:10.006
in a certain light.
It's like more like--

40:10.008 --> 40:11.541
-Like a shadow?
-Yeah.

40:11.543 --> 40:14.010
And misconceptions,
they stick on books,

40:14.012 --> 40:15.145
color our judgment.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.014
This is the future
of picture watching?

40:18.016 --> 40:19.983
Danielle Steele
and Jackie Collins?

40:19.985 --> 40:21.117
And Ann Welty.

40:21.119 --> 40:23.052
Oh! [laughs]

40:23.054 --> 40:24.854
The most graphic of them all.

40:24.856 --> 40:25.855
She's just punchy.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.490
She has my heart.

40:28.059 --> 40:31.494
Theo, funny feeling,
she's not yours.

40:31.496 --> 40:32.462
Oh, no.

40:32.464 --> 40:33.797
I can appreciate Welty.

40:33.799 --> 40:36.032
She ogles the rich
and famous like Collins,

40:36.034 --> 40:38.034
but with more artistic punch.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.469
All are straightforward.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.837
Welty offers more.

40:40.839 --> 40:43.440
She's more <i> spirituelle.</i>

40:43.442 --> 40:45.141
[Gwen] Are you
trying to be nice?

40:45.143 --> 40:47.577
Big ideas don't
come from big words.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.846
Well, while you're
off playing word chess,

40:49.848 --> 40:52.682
-you lose your audience.
-What audience?

40:52.684 --> 40:55.952
Well, maybe if Ann Welty
lived a little off the page,

40:55.954 --> 41:00.123
to me she's too much
wonderment of the banal.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.658
But what about John Updike?

41:01.660 --> 41:03.993
Couldn't the same be said
of him? You love him.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.529
Of course. He was <i> risqué.</i>

41:06.531 --> 41:09.032
-Aye.
-Perhaps you could
talk about adaptation.

41:09.034 --> 41:11.868
These ladies are going down
that road for the first time.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.136
It's good for business,
but don't bother

41:13.138 --> 41:14.170
writing the script.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.872
Leave that to the wolves.

41:15.874 --> 41:17.474
Books are different
than movies and both

41:17.476 --> 41:19.008
are different than real life.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.777
Listen, a bit on words.

41:20.779 --> 41:23.813
I know populism
is in these days,

41:23.815 --> 41:27.484
appeal to the ruralites,
but words are important.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.752
They must be handled with care.

41:29.754 --> 41:33.089
Ideas are viruses
that can infect us all.

41:33.091 --> 41:35.492
So, when they are
handled recklessly,

41:35.494 --> 41:38.228
and gain an audience,
as both these young ladies

41:38.230 --> 41:41.231
have been so lucky
to have gained,

41:41.233 --> 41:42.599
words really mean something.

41:42.601 --> 41:44.567
They are paid for their words.

41:44.569 --> 41:47.837
They should use them well
as they build sentences.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.273
And the sentences
reach up to form the rafters

41:50.275 --> 41:54.277
so meaning can
harbor safely in its clasp.

41:55.080 --> 41:59.015
This shelter is
the church of readers.

42:00.085 --> 42:01.718
Did you adapt that
from here is the church,

42:01.720 --> 42:03.553
-here is the steeple?
-[audience chuckling]

42:03.555 --> 42:06.089
Open the doors
then see all the people?

42:06.658 --> 42:08.925
You know,
bad reviews can ruin careers.

42:09.194 --> 42:12.195
-Are you threatening us,
Mr. Mencken?
-Just you, Mrs. Bellow.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.998
-Oh, no.
-Oh, God. God, help me. Maybe
I shouldn't have done this.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.902
So, I think that things
don't have to be
incomprehensible to be great?

42:18.904 --> 42:22.105
No, it doesn't,
but it should at least
aspire for something.

42:22.574 --> 42:25.542
Irving doesn't write until
he knows the last sentence.

42:25.544 --> 42:27.911
Well, that's great, for him.

42:27.913 --> 42:29.946
But, we're all different souls

42:29.948 --> 42:31.781
and assuming
that's where we write from,

42:31.783 --> 42:33.616
it ought to be different.

42:33.618 --> 42:37.887
And distilling 10,000 hours
into a couple hundred pages.

42:38.089 --> 42:40.256
I mean, you can't hide from
yourself when you're alone

42:40.258 --> 42:44.127
-writing for months and months.
-Or years.

42:44.129 --> 42:46.262
Yeah, and then, a reader
takes it down in a couple weeks.

42:46.264 --> 42:47.196
Or a day.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.666
So the publishers hope.

42:49.668 --> 42:50.867
Better to have that bar lower,

42:50.869 --> 42:53.002
and move on so as not to reveal

42:53.004 --> 42:56.973
there is nothing to your
superficial marriageableness.

42:57.175 --> 43:00.843
You say the word soul,
yet your sentences go nowhere

43:00.845 --> 43:03.079
because they
aspire for so little.

43:03.281 --> 43:04.881
And yes, I'm calling you out.

43:04.883 --> 43:06.983
I heart colloquialisms.

43:06.985 --> 43:09.052
Yeah, well,
it's easy to throw stones.

43:09.054 --> 43:11.721
True.
Not easy to crack that glass.

43:11.723 --> 43:13.323
-Now that's just mean.
-[Carrie gasping]

43:13.325 --> 43:14.357
That's just mean.

43:14.359 --> 43:16.225
Well, why don't you show us how?

43:16.861 --> 43:18.895
Right now,
with all the cameras rolling?

43:19.965 --> 43:22.098
And on that note,
we'll be right back.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.733
[break music]

43:24.336 --> 43:27.103
Hide the razor blades,
I'm going to kill myself.

43:30.875 --> 43:31.841
[loud knocking]

43:31.843 --> 43:33.776
[scanner beeping]

43:33.778 --> 43:35.345

43:47.626 --> 43:48.958

44:19.658 --> 44:20.890
His clean collar contrasted

44:20.892 --> 44:22.058
his light amber scruff,

44:22.060 --> 44:24.193
spotless shoes, worn belt holes

44:24.195 --> 44:26.763
showing a recent attention
to fitness, well-tied tie,

44:26.765 --> 44:27.997
perfectly upturned cuff.

44:27.999 --> 44:31.267
All in all,
a well-put together man.

44:46.151 --> 44:47.116
Excuse me.

44:47.752 --> 44:49.152
Are you good at algebra?

44:49.788 --> 44:52.121
Think you could
replace my X without asking Y?

44:52.123 --> 44:54.190
I'm sorry, that sounded
so much better when I read it.

44:55.727 --> 44:56.959
Hi, I'm Brad.

44:58.063 --> 44:59.395
Nice to meet you.

44:59.397 --> 45:01.831
I don't have a
pickup as cheesy as that.

45:01.833 --> 45:02.699
Checkmate.

45:02.701 --> 45:03.900
[chuckles]

45:03.902 --> 45:05.034
Excuse me.

45:05.036 --> 45:06.169
Nice try.

45:06.171 --> 45:07.770
Get back in line.

45:08.773 --> 45:10.273
-She's...
-Nina.

45:10.275 --> 45:11.974
...with me, now.

45:14.245 --> 45:15.912
If this is what
she gives up for coffee,

45:15.914 --> 45:18.014
imagine what she gives up
to get into a club.

45:19.751 --> 45:21.484
[lively music]

45:24.489 --> 45:25.788
[Eryn chuckles]

45:28.159 --> 45:29.092
BRB.

45:36.935 --> 45:38.768
[Eryn voiceover] <i> The</i>
<i> tingle bounced off the inside</i>

So, is this your coffee shop?

46:08.500 --> 46:10.833
You mean, do I come here often?

46:11.836 --> 46:13.503
Yes, I'm afraid so.

46:14.506 --> 46:16.305
And we're past the icebreaker.
[chuckles]

46:16.307 --> 46:18.374
Yeah,
I realize how that sounded.

46:18.376 --> 46:20.409
I just so badly
wanted to say the right thing,

46:20.411 --> 46:23.179
and in the process of throwing
out all the wrong things,

46:23.181 --> 46:25.248
you know,
don't say that, not that one,

46:25.250 --> 46:28.851
definitely not that,
I guess that one

46:28.853 --> 46:30.553
sort of got overlooked.

46:30.555 --> 46:32.421
I'm sorry.

46:36.461 --> 46:37.727
Not sorry.

46:37.728 --> 46:38.994
Do you think love at
first sight is endangered?

46:46.104 --> 46:48.337
[gentle music]

46:52.210 --> 46:54.076
[Eryn sighing]

-This is me.
-Oh.

47:01.452 --> 47:03.486

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:24.906
Your cousin?

01:02:25.743 --> 01:02:27.242
My cousin's brother.

01:02:28.212 --> 01:02:29.811
So, your cousin?

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:33.381
Yeah, no, no. I don't know.

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:35.851
-What, is it the half-brother?
-Who, what?

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:38.453
To the cousin that you're
in this relationship with.

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:43.475
Isn't that what
we're talking about here?

01:02:43.476 --> 01:02:45.126
So, you're not bothered by this?
You're just trying to
figure it out? Like family tree?

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:49.765
-Oh.
-What?

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.099
Oh.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:53.034
Is this incest fetish?

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.240
Wow, you are something else.

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:00.809
Oh, my God.

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:02.344
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:04.045
[somber music]

01:03:04.047 --> 01:03:05.847
[Brad scoffs]

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:16.024
Your jacket!

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:19.528
You're going to catch a cold!

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:43.351
So what are you saying?
You broke up with him?

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:46.521
I was crawling into bed with
someone who was willing to
entertain an incest fetish.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.857
Do you have no
concern for my well-being?

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:53.295
Oh, sweetie, guys are into
much weirder stuff than that.

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:56.198
I just read about a micro
trend that they're doing it

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.166
with dolphins,
believe it or not.

01:03:58.602 --> 01:04:00.268
[Eryn] You are no help.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.170
Your problem is you need to have

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.606
a lot more experience with guys.

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:06.341
Why don't you go on the Tinder

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:09.177
or, uh, that new one, rumble.com

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:14.015
<i> or mash.com</i>
<i> or you poke me and...</i>

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.016
Goodbye.

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:16.885
-Bye.

[people chattering]

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.507
So, um, where did you,

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:41.409
where did you grow up?

01:04:41.912 --> 01:04:43.078
What are you doing?

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.279
Oh.

01:04:44.982 --> 01:04:46.047

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.087
So.

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:05.567
Oh, my God, are you...

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:06.635
I'm sorry.

01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:10.005
-It's hard for me.
-Here.

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:11.172
Oh, um...

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.010
I can't, it's just...

01:05:18.682 --> 01:05:22.083
-You're a writer?
-I mean, everyone's
a writer, technically.

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.084
I guess, I mean...

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:24.586
[Eryn chuckles]

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:25.687
I text a lot.

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:28.690
-I mean, it's not
entirely the same thing.
-No not.

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:31.059
Tell me about you.
What do you do?

01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:34.129
[sighs] Um, you know
I like to think of myself

01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:36.231
as more than just an accountant.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.268
I live a very full life
on the weekends.

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:43.104
Things beyond the numbers,

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:44.572
things beyond numbers.

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:46.708
Oh, wow. It's amazing.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:50.412
Um, would you like
to go out again sometime?

01:05:50.414 --> 01:05:52.180
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:53.949
You, yes,
I would love to, actually.

01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:55.684
Gimme your number.

[crickets chirping]

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.654
I really always
wanted to try this, for real.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.589
Oh, yeah, but cash is dirty.

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:36.424
Ones are the worst.

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:38.293
Oh.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:39.561
Touched the most hands.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.367
You really thought of that?

01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:52.607
[Franklin] Ah.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:14.529
-Hi. Is this your dog?
-Yes.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:15.497
-Ho--
-Thank you so much.

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:16.564

01:07:17.768 --> 01:07:19.467
Yeah, wait, wait I got a treat.

-Look, I don't know how
I can repay you.
-You're welcome.

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:32.080
But can I take you out?
Do you want to maybe come in?

01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:34.215
I would love a glass of water.
That's a heavy dog.

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:37.152
Cool. And maybe we could
like have sex or something?

01:07:38.355 --> 01:07:39.621
-Maybe some--
-How about a glass of water?

01:07:39.623 --> 01:07:41.456
Yeah. Come on.

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:47.829
-I mean, it was great day.
-[Eryn giggling]

01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:49.297
Buckles, thank you, awesome.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:51.366
-You are so welcome.
-Yeah, fantastic.

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:53.601
How's that avocado?

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:55.470
Um, it's good,
I love it [giggles].

-That's good.
Those are good fats.
-Thank you, yeah.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.840
I like guacamole, so.

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.809
-Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
I'm big on the guac.
-Yeah.

01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:03.144
-Oh.
-Had a good workout today.

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:03.812
Great.

01:08:03.814 --> 01:08:05.213
Yeah.

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:06.481
Big WAD.

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:07.415
Big what?

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:08.650
-WAD.
-Big WAD?

01:08:08.652 --> 01:08:09.551
-Yeah.
-Oh.

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:10.819
Workout of the day.

-Oh, workout of the day?
-Yeah.

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:13.154
I don't think
I've heard that before.

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:15.090
Yeah, and hit some PRs.

01:08:15.092 --> 01:08:15.757
What's that?

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:16.724
[Seth] Personal records.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.259
-Nice.
-And PBs, PBs.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:19.794
-PBs? I get it now.
I get that.

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:21.529
-Personal best.
-Personal best?

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:23.298
Yeah, my personal best.
I've always against myself,

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.732
competition
against myself, like--

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:27.535
I like that you
take care of yourself. That's--

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:29.804
Hey, without your health,
you don't have anything.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.840
-Yeah.
-So, yeah.

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:35.877
Health, my dog
and, you know, a lady.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:42.750
Good night.

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:44.652
Listen,
I can't thank you enough.

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:48.423
Is this the part where I
say you can thank me in bed?

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:50.625
I mean, yeah,

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.194
uh, I won't turn you down.

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:54.662
[both laughing]

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:59.367
But that's something that
could wait till the second date

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.635
if you want.

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:04.606
Thanks for saving Buckles.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:07.308
It's just a weird name.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:09.277
I'm sorry. [laughs]

01:09:09.513 --> 01:09:11.813
Listen on second thought,
do you want to just--

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.615
Good night, Seth.

01:09:29.633 --> 01:09:31.166
Everyone, turn 'em over.

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:34.469
All right.
And down the rows, to the left.

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:37.272
I'll take those.

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:39.674
Thank you.

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:43.478

-Hi.
-Good to see you.

-You, too. You look great.
-Thanks.

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:40.595
Do you mind if I sit here?

01:11:40.597 --> 01:11:42.563
Um, yeah, sure. No problem.

01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:44.499
[laughs] Want to
keep my back to the door,

01:11:44.501 --> 01:11:46.000
so I could just focus on you.

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:47.302
Nice.

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:48.670
Ah, I got shots for us.

01:11:48.672 --> 01:11:49.604
Great.

-Um--
-Gains.

01:11:54.077 --> 01:11:58.646
-So, did you work out today?
-Ooh ah. Just got it in.

-I'm still buzzing.

01:12:00.383 --> 01:12:01.916
-Right.
-Every workout,

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:03.384
-making through.
-Yeah, nice.

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:06.587
-Yeah, I hit a major PR today.
-Um--

01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:08.589
-Personal record.
-Right.

01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:09.724
-Yeah, rowing.
-You told me that.

in under four minutes.

-I mean, like, I'm bulging.
-Eryn] Yeah.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.096
Did you know that
when you're working out

01:12:15.098 --> 01:12:18.733
you're actually tearing muscle
fibers like a zipper?

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:23.404
You have the myosin and the
actin, so like you're
tearing them apart

01:12:23.406 --> 01:12:26.441
-and then you rebuild them.
Science.
-So, that is science.

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:28.609
I guess you're
sort of a scientist.

01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:30.411
Yeah, you know,
by proxy, I think so.

01:12:30.413 --> 01:12:31.913
Yeah.

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:34.716
What does your
diet say about shots?

01:12:34.718 --> 01:12:37.585
-Going into a cheat day,
so I say, bring it on.
-Great.

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:40.755
Bartender,
could we get two more each.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:43.775
[Seth] Whoa!

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:44.859
For a little girl,
you can really drink.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:49.630
-So, what else do you do
when you're not working--
-HIIT.

01:12:49.632 --> 01:12:53.101
-HIIT?
-Uh, high intensity
interval training. Cardio.

01:12:53.103 --> 01:12:55.737
-Oh.
-Yeah. I'm really looking
to get ripped right now,

01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:59.006
so that keeps your metabolism
up, gets you shredded.

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:00.875
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.877
[Seth] So basically,
my metabolism,

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.779
off the chain right now.

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:07.014
I'm burning calories
when I'm out of the gym.

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:08.483
Caloric burn.

01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:10.618
[Eryn] So, do you
ever do yoga or--

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.453
Yeah, I think you, as
much as you build up the muscle,

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:13.654
-you got to stretch it.
-What the hell is this?

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:16.824
-Oh, who the hell are you?
-Who the hell are you?

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:18.059
How about that last shot?

01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:20.728
Oh, my gosh. Gains.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.163
Look, I know we got
into some weird stuff,

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:24.499
but this is batshit crazy.

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.968
Oh, eh, don't talk
to the lady like that.

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:29.404
Dude, I bet you
don't even have a clue.

01:13:29.406 --> 01:13:30.872
Did she tell you what
she did with her cousin?

01:13:30.874 --> 01:13:32.774
No,
what'd she do with her cousin?

01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:36.444
Okay, I think it's time to go

01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:38.146
you and your
little incest story.

01:13:38.148 --> 01:13:40.648
I mean, she clearly moved on
and I think you should leave.

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:42.717
Yeah, have fun with this guy.

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:45.420
[tense music]

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:48.423
[people shouting]

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:49.824
[men grunting]

01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.467
[Brad panting]

01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:04.639
Oh, oh, excuse me,
oh, is this for me?

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:06.507
Thank you so much.

01:14:29.232 --> 01:14:30.798
[loud knocking]

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.568
Buckles, sit, sit.

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:37.672
Hey, you, come here. Hey.

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:39.207
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:14:39.209 --> 01:14:42.577
I brought you a hangover cure
and a protein shake,

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:45.546
in case you've already
worked out which knowing you...

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:47.582
Thanks.

01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:50.585
I'll make sure not to
venture too far from the toilet.

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:51.786
Smart.

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:55.223
Look,
I also wanted to apologize.

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:56.624
Don't worry about it.

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:58.526
Listen, it's fine.

01:14:58.528 --> 01:15:00.127
All's well that
doesn't end in death.

01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:02.930
I like that.

01:15:04.234 --> 01:15:07.134
Listen,
I got to get ready for the gym,

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:09.136
unless you want to, uh?

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:12.206
-Fuck?
-Yeah.

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:13.207
No, Seth.

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:15.176
Buckles, come on. Let's go.

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:29.957
Starting here. This one,
this one, this one, this one.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.794
-Who is next one, two,
eight, eight.
-Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:39.033
Hey, what?
What are you doing here?

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:41.536
No, I just, I just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:43.137
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:47.808
-Hey, hey, go to class.
-Oh.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.277
I told the kids
I had eye surgery.

01:15:49.279 --> 01:15:51.546
Third grade and bar brawls
don't go together.

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:55.283
Okay, I also,
I wanted to confess.

01:15:55.285 --> 01:15:57.051
Yeah, I don't read that crap.

01:15:58.121 --> 01:15:59.820
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

01:16:01.658 --> 01:16:08.296
Sorry about what? [sighs]

01:16:08.298 --> 01:16:10.865
You deserve better
than me and my gimmicks, Brad.

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.673
You should leave.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.812
Yeah.

01:16:28.685 --> 01:16:29.717
[Eryn sighs]

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:32.687
[Brad sighs]

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:47.068
[chuckles] Oh, just a phase?

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:48.369
[chuckles] You can call it that.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.805
And, phases come and go,

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.873
Sometimes with the season, huh?

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:57.345
[Eryn chuckling]

01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:00.715
[keyboard clacking]

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:09.056
[sighs]

01:17:48.698 --> 01:17:50.097
[dog whimpering]

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:21.729
[shower curtain rings
clattering]

01:18:21.731 --> 01:18:23.364
[Eryn panting]

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.471
[birds chirping]

01:19:16.853 --> 01:19:18.252
[book thudding]

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:20.387
[Eryn thudding]

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:22.156
[Theo] Yet, Nina was relieved.

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:24.325
She was robbed of nothing.

01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:28.129
Instead, he had set her free.

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:30.798
It was never going
to be a clean break.

01:19:31.234 --> 01:19:33.534
At least, the licking
flames looked beautiful

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:37.238
as the curtains fell
just prior to her third act.

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:42.943
End there,
before it really gets sad.

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:46.347
[audience applauding]

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:51.185
Um, how much of it
is really true?

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:55.856
-None of it. It's a book.
But I did my research.
-[audience applauding]

01:19:56.259 --> 01:19:59.894
-[Carrie] You did a great job.
[Theo] Thank you very much.
You did a great job.

01:19:59.896 --> 01:20:02.363
And now do you think
this will be a new category?

01:20:02.865 --> 01:20:05.466
[chuckles] If it
sells more books, sure.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.935
Everyone's so busy
constructing universes.

01:20:07.937 --> 01:20:10.237
I'm dabbling in the multiverse.

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:12.106
-There you go then.
-[Carrie chuckling]

01:20:12.108 --> 01:20:14.141
-See, that's right.
-It's very cool.

01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:21.148
Uh, any advice for
an aspiring writer, Theo?

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:27.354
Well, there can be a living
in it if you care more about
it than any other living writer

01:20:28.024 --> 01:20:30.858
and just as much as
all those who came before.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.028
Did you work
with Eryn Bellow on it?

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.297
Uh, you know,
if you can't read the cover,

01:20:36.299 --> 01:20:38.933
you probably
shouldn't get the book.

01:20:39.435 --> 01:20:42.102
Then why didn't she
just write her own memoir?

01:20:42.104 --> 01:20:44.071
Because then
it'd have to be true.

01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:46.006
[Theo chuckling]

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:47.875
Don't forget to
tell your friends.

01:20:52.114 --> 01:20:54.081
Spoiler alert,
the line of defamation

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:56.550
is tested as Mr. Mencken
trounces his main character

01:20:56.552 --> 01:20:59.153
in the end bringing
to life Burrough's belief

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:02.056
that heroes and heroines
are meant to be killed.

01:21:02.058 --> 01:21:05.392
In this case not before
the writer wakes from a coma,

01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:08.529
only to discover
she's lost both her hands,

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:10.397
and thus, her will to write.

01:21:38.094 --> 01:21:40.361
[clock ticking]

01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:56.343
Look, just because
it's a sensation doesn't mean

01:21:56.345 --> 01:21:58.345
we have to go nuts
with the second printing.

01:21:58.347 --> 01:21:59.914
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
sorry to intrude.

01:21:59.916 --> 01:22:01.448
-Oh, oh, hi, Carrie.
-Hi.

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:03.117
Can you cover this for me?

01:22:03.119 --> 01:22:05.519
-We may be reissuing it.
-[Kate] Is it any good?

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:09.356
I don't know.
I have no fucking idea. Ugh.

01:22:09.358 --> 01:22:10.591
[bell ringing]

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:15.396
[gasps] Um,
Eryn's in your office.

01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:16.330
Oh?

01:22:22.038 --> 01:22:24.138
All right,
let me know how that goes.

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:28.509
I didn't know
you were in New York.

01:22:30.513 --> 01:22:31.478
Yeah.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:36.550
I don't know what to tell you.

01:22:39.155 --> 01:22:40.421
Tell me something.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:48.095
You were a lot less
likable in the first draft.

01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:51.816
Fuck you.

01:22:51.817 --> 01:22:53.000
[Carrie] Come on.
I'm in it, too.

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:55.669
You didn't lose your hands
and the will to write.

01:22:57.173 --> 01:22:59.506
It's not real, okay?

01:22:59.742 --> 01:23:01.408
It's not real.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:04.211
Plus, I sent you the pages.

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:07.014
I even sent you the ARC to read.

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:10.417
You know life goes on

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:15.122
for us working
people in the real world.

01:23:15.124 --> 01:23:16.991
You hijacked my life.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.694
Those are details you told him.
They could've only
come from you.

01:23:20.696 --> 01:23:23.364
All right,
I edited the hell out of him.

01:23:23.366 --> 01:23:25.199
You, I give carte blanche.

01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:27.167
We couldn't agree on a subject.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.005
When did you become his agent?

01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:33.407
Who do you think got him
on that talk show?

01:23:34.777 --> 01:23:38.178
Listen this,
this is nothing but hype.

01:23:39.782 --> 01:23:42.016
Before you know it,
it's going to be collecting dust

01:23:42.018 --> 01:23:45.486
in those secondhand bookstores
that you love so much.

01:23:45.488 --> 01:23:46.653
Those are an important
part of our ecosystem.

01:23:46.655 --> 01:23:48.188
Okay, fine, I'm sorry.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:49.523
I didn't mean to insult you

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:52.726
or your
secondhand bookstore buddies.

01:23:52.728 --> 01:23:55.329
Why can't you just
think of this as a straw man.

01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:57.765
You're, you're,
you're more than welcome

01:23:57.767 --> 01:23:59.566
to knock it down
whenever you want.

01:24:00.269 --> 01:24:04.304
Can't you just write something

01:24:04.306 --> 01:24:05.672
even if it has imperfections.

01:24:05.674 --> 01:24:07.408
They'll say
you're going Kerouac.

01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:10.477
Just gimme a masterpiece
for God sakes.

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:14.815
Three years,
three years past due.

01:24:17.053 --> 01:24:18.519
You're fired, Carrie.

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:23.424
What?

01:24:23.426 --> 01:24:24.758
Really?

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:25.692
Really.

01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:30.464
How the hell am I'm
supposed to work with you?

01:24:30.466 --> 01:24:32.066
You exploited me.

01:24:33.069 --> 01:24:35.702
Oh, God, so typical.

01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:37.638
I've exploited you.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.074
I've been
freaking breathing life

01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:43.310
into your wasting career,

01:24:43.612 --> 01:24:45.546
keeping you on life support.

01:24:45.548 --> 01:24:48.082
Why can't you
just give me something?

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:50.851
I can put your
career back on track.

01:24:50.853 --> 01:24:53.420
I can get you
freaking published.

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:55.289
You're not the only
person who can do that for me.

01:24:55.291 --> 01:24:57.224
Yes, I am, actually.

01:25:00.096 --> 01:25:02.696
Are you going to give
the publishers back
their advance money?

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:04.765
And how about me?

01:25:05.801 --> 01:25:07.601
Where's my 10%?

01:25:09.572 --> 01:25:11.505
I've been doing my job

01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:14.708
and quite creatively,
I might add.

01:25:20.316 --> 01:25:21.882
Your mom always listened to me.

01:25:22.685 --> 01:25:24.818
You're making a mistake.

01:25:47.543 --> 01:25:50.577
[somber music]

01:25:59.855 --> 01:26:01.655
[Eryn sighs]

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:04.591
You know every time
you look at a memory,

01:26:04.593 --> 01:26:07.194
it changes just a little bit.

01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:10.531
Never stays the same.

01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:14.735
But it can be for the good,

01:26:16.272 --> 01:26:17.804
like anything else.

01:26:19.175 --> 01:26:20.174
Right?

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:25.546
[Eryn sniffles]

01:26:26.282 --> 01:26:27.781
It can, baby.

01:26:47.503 --> 01:26:50.437
[birds chirping]

01:26:55.211 --> 01:26:56.376
[Eryn sighs]

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:58.645
[keyboard clacking]

01:27:20.803 --> 01:27:23.704
[tense orchestral music]

01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:30.677
[phone ringing]

01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:32.412
[phone vibrating]

01:27:32.781 --> 01:27:34.481
Hey, you have something for me?

01:27:34.717 --> 01:27:36.583
I need you to send me
the uncorrected proofs.

01:27:37.453 --> 01:27:39.419
Uh, well,
that's a little hard to do

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:41.455
before you send it to me.

01:27:41.457 --> 01:27:42.656
No, Mencken's.

01:27:43.392 --> 01:27:44.725
Why?

01:27:44.727 --> 01:27:46.026
[Eryn] <i> Before you cut him back.</i>

01:27:46.996 --> 01:27:48.495
[Carrie] <i> Why,</i>
<i> what are you going to do?</i>

01:27:49.398 --> 01:27:50.864
Reply, in kind.

01:27:51.567 --> 01:27:54.735
-Either that
or sue your company.
-The publisher?

01:27:54.737 --> 01:27:58.005
For defamation.
Although I'm pretty sure,
I can prove collusion, too.

01:27:58.007 --> 01:27:59.840
Just send me the proofs.

01:27:59.842 --> 01:28:01.975
Okay.

01:28:02.378 --> 01:28:05.379
Literary revenge, I like it.

01:28:05.381 --> 01:28:08.015
You see, this is why I told them

01:28:08.017 --> 01:28:10.050
not to take
your advance back yet.

01:28:10.052 --> 01:28:12.419
I knew you'd get
struck by something.

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:16.423
They were thinking
lightning but I bet book.

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:18.725
Sweetie?

01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:20.994
Sweetie?

01:28:22.898 --> 01:28:23.864
[loud knocking]

01:28:26.502 --> 01:28:27.668
Hi.

01:28:27.836 --> 01:28:28.769
And you.

01:28:47.923 --> 01:28:51.058
[lighthearted music]

01:28:54.463 --> 01:28:55.929
[Eryn] Hi, is this your dog?

01:28:56.598 --> 01:28:58.699
Yes, ah, Buckles.

01:28:58.901 --> 01:29:02.569
-Thank you so much
for finding Buckles.
-That is such a cute name.

01:29:02.571 --> 01:29:04.838
Listen, I don't know
how could I repay you?

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.807
Maybe with some sex?

01:29:06.809 --> 01:29:07.974
[Eryn chuckles]

01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:09.042
Yeah? To the bed.

01:29:09.044 --> 01:29:10.844
Bellow.

01:29:13.649 --> 01:29:15.082
Is that a caramel macchiato?

01:29:15.918 --> 01:29:17.584
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
that's what you ordered.

01:29:17.586 --> 01:29:18.752
No, I ordered a macchiato.

01:29:18.754 --> 01:29:19.953
It's just foam and espresso.

01:29:22.991 --> 01:29:24.174
With caramel.

01:29:24.175 --> 01:29:25.358
Yeah, but I'm looking for
just foam and espresso.

01:29:25.361 --> 01:29:26.593
-That's it.
-No, it's in the name,

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:28.762
-caramel macchiato.

-Wait, stop, stop!
-Oh, what the--

01:31:40.662 --> 01:31:42.796
-What the?
-Shit, open it!

01:31:42.798 --> 01:31:43.997
Open it!

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:45.165
[Seth] Holy shit.

01:31:45.167 --> 01:31:46.099
Yeah.

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:51.972
Nina? What are you doing?
The sensor's broken.

01:31:51.974 --> 01:31:52.906
Got it.

01:31:52.908 --> 01:31:54.107
And it's Eryn.

01:31:55.511 --> 01:31:56.243
Come on.

01:32:02.117 --> 01:32:03.049
To drink.

01:32:03.051 --> 01:32:04.017
I'm fine.

01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:05.719
Whatever, they're cheap.

01:32:05.721 --> 01:32:06.786
I'm just going to
leave it right here

01:32:06.788 --> 01:32:08.221
in case you change your mind.

01:32:10.759 --> 01:32:13.827
I can't believe
you're not a Nina.

01:32:13.829 --> 01:32:16.763
-I can only see you as a Nina.
-[Eryn chuckles]

01:32:16.765 --> 01:32:19.099
[chuckles] Don't you think
you shouldn't change my name

01:32:19.101 --> 01:32:21.101
to something
better in your version?

01:32:21.103 --> 01:32:22.636
What's your fancy?

01:32:23.205 --> 01:32:26.006
Something like Bartholomew.

01:32:26.542 --> 01:32:27.240
[Eryn laughs]

01:32:27.242 --> 01:32:28.575
It's a good famous name.

01:32:28.577 --> 01:32:30.210
No, it is a shit name.

01:32:30.212 --> 01:32:32.779
You are terrible with names.
That's as bad as Buckles.

01:32:32.781 --> 01:32:34.314
Oh, do you think we
should reiterate the fact

01:32:34.316 --> 01:32:35.949
that you got me drunk

01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:37.784
which is why I lost that fight?

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.819
That and we're supposed
to see that other guy

01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:43.089
-as the good guy and I'm the--
-Dick.

01:32:44.026 --> 01:32:47.060
Now, you are talking.
You're taking the words
right out of my mouth.

01:32:47.663 --> 01:32:50.297
Do you think you could
like craft up a little passage

01:32:50.299 --> 01:32:54.067
about, you know, in like
Charles Dickens-like detail

01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:58.905
about the size, and girth,
and beauty of my [laughs]...

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:00.974
[lively music]

01:33:01.343 --> 01:33:04.611
[keyboard clacking]

01:33:17.693 --> 01:33:20.293
But it's unique. Fine. The first
thing I'm going to share

01:33:20.295 --> 01:33:22.596
is slightly different
than what you're used to.

01:33:38.614 --> 01:33:41.214
[gentle music]

01:33:44.987 --> 01:33:46.653
[light knocking]

01:33:46.655 --> 01:33:47.721
Come in.

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:51.725
Hi.

01:33:53.962 --> 01:33:55.095
Hi.

01:33:55.097 --> 01:33:56.396
Do you have a minute?

01:33:56.398 --> 01:33:58.098
-Nina, uh--
-Eryn.

01:34:00.168 --> 01:34:02.202
This is my place of work.
You can't be here.

01:34:02.204 --> 01:34:06.006
Yeah, I thought this was
a better job for you, okay?

01:34:06.274 --> 01:34:07.807
Still anything we'd discuss here

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:10.176
is probably not
going to be appropriate.

01:34:10.846 --> 01:34:11.845
It's true.

01:34:13.081 --> 01:34:15.281
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

01:34:15.283 --> 01:34:17.150
Mrs. Ortiz,
I'm going to grab a coffee.

01:34:17.152 --> 01:34:19.986
-[Mrs. Ortiz] I made it.
-I need it strong.

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:21.755
If I make it any stronger
it'll kill you.

01:34:21.757 --> 01:34:23.690
[phone ringing]

01:34:33.135 --> 01:34:34.901
I can't believe
your name's not Nina.

01:34:37.039 --> 01:34:39.706
I am known by many names.

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:42.809
[laughs evilly]

01:34:44.913 --> 01:34:46.846
I can't believe
you're not really a teacher.

01:34:47.215 --> 01:34:49.082
Well, in my defense,
you never asked.

01:34:50.352 --> 01:34:52.385
Subbing for a teacher
on maternity leave

01:34:52.387 --> 01:34:54.454
isn't something I bring up
on first dates.

01:34:54.456 --> 01:34:57.190
See, this is why backstories
should never be overlooked.

01:34:57.726 --> 01:35:00.226
That and I don't
fancy sympathy lays.

01:35:01.329 --> 01:35:04.230
You're right. Role-playing
should never be depressing.

01:35:04.766 --> 01:35:07.167
Stalker-rape on the
second date is pretty extreme.

01:35:07.169 --> 01:35:11.771
Yeah, I thought so, too.
But, I mean, at least
you won the fight, right?

01:35:11.773 --> 01:35:13.139
Yeah.

01:35:13.141 --> 01:35:15.108
Do you think they were
rooting for me, too?

01:35:17.145 --> 01:35:19.813
I think that was the design.

01:35:21.483 --> 01:35:23.349
So where from here?

01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:29.856
[Eryn] Do you think it's
possible for things to get
convoluted

01:35:29.858 --> 01:35:31.458
past the point of no return?

01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:33.893
You mean, if we have a chance?

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:36.362
Yeah, well, like, I mean,
I know you're not real but--

01:35:36.364 --> 01:35:37.297
I'm not.

01:35:38.166 --> 01:35:39.966
And yet, here you are.

01:35:39.968 --> 01:35:41.334
So, whatever.

01:35:41.336 --> 01:35:42.736
There's no going back.

01:35:42.738 --> 01:35:44.437
This ship only moves forward.

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:46.973
They invented rewind for VCRs.

01:35:46.975 --> 01:35:48.875
Oh boy, there's something
I'm not nostalgic for.

01:35:50.812 --> 01:35:53.747
Wait. Is there anything
that you would change?

01:35:54.182 --> 01:35:55.515
Let me see it.

01:35:59.888 --> 01:36:01.821
[Eryn] This is dangerous.

01:36:01.823 --> 01:36:02.756
Yeah.

01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:10.263
[gasps] What if I kidnapped you?

01:36:10.799 --> 01:36:12.832
More research for your sequel?

01:36:13.468 --> 01:36:15.301
Stockholm syndrome.
Like Bonnie and Clyde

01:36:15.303 --> 01:36:18.338
but in a steampunk setting
with gangsters.

01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:20.473
I mean, I think we're
really getting somewhere here.

01:36:20.475 --> 01:36:23.143
Let me just tell Ortiz I quit.

01:36:34.823 --> 01:36:36.856
But in the end,
we're from two different worlds.

01:36:39.461 --> 01:36:41.294
Mine's a more perfect universe.

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:44.097
[sighs]

01:36:49.838 --> 01:36:51.838
If I can control it,
it's not real.

01:36:56.211 --> 01:36:57.410
Goodbye, Brad.

01:37:02.050 --> 01:37:03.116
Bye, Eryn.

01:37:04.219 --> 01:37:05.285
Thank you.

01:37:06.154 --> 01:37:08.855

01:37:22.037 --> 01:37:23.102
[sputtering]

01:37:41.489 --> 01:37:44.557
So have you found a new place?
-I'm really still looking.
Yeah.

01:37:44.559 --> 01:37:49.462
I have a few options that
I'm going to decide between.

01:37:49.464 --> 01:37:52.465
I can show you if you want to
help. I could use some,
a little bit of help

01:37:52.467 --> 01:37:56.970
-deciding honestly. Yeah.
-I'd love to, yeah.

01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:08.214
What about like a period
love story, like pre-cellphone.

01:38:08.216 --> 01:38:10.049
There's a lot of
places that I can go with that.

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:14.087
But that's like,
uh, that's what '80s

01:38:14.089 --> 01:38:16.489
or like 1800s?

01:38:16.925 --> 01:38:19.659
Or like I do an 1800s thing
with cell phones.

01:38:20.362 --> 01:38:21.427
Like a mashup.

01:38:21.429 --> 01:38:28.568
-Sci-fi set in the '90s
with rap music.
-No.

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:30.336
And a little
birdie told me that you

01:38:30.338 --> 01:38:32.639
have been
meeting other productions

01:38:32.641 --> 01:38:35.508
and I know you have
your pick of who you want

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:38.044
to make this book
into a film, so...

01:38:38.947 --> 01:38:40.413
[ladle clanking]

01:38:40.582 --> 01:38:41.514
Oh.

01:38:44.152 --> 01:38:45.385

[Mrs. Omnibus]
Oh, that's a fun one.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.567
Written in high school,
published years later.

01:39:02.337 --> 01:39:03.403
Pretty pure stuff.

01:39:03.405 --> 01:39:06.239
It's like two
totally different things.

01:39:06.241 --> 01:39:08.074
-I don't do well--
-Yeah but you like nice things.

01:39:08.076 --> 01:39:09.375
[Eryn] I like nice things but--

01:39:09.377 --> 01:39:10.710
[Carrie] Well,
you got to pay for them.

01:39:10.712 --> 01:39:12.045
-Whoa.
-What the--

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:14.514
[keyboard clacking]

get you some Chartreuse?

Yes.

01:41:25.713 --> 01:41:29.315
-Looking good for
a shotgun wedding.
-Uh, no baby.

01:41:29.384 --> 01:41:33.286
Honeymoon first. I mean, aren't
you the one who accused me
of liking perfect order?

01:41:33.288 --> 01:41:35.822
Or maybe by baby I
meant your next book.

01:41:36.758 --> 01:41:40.793
-Hmm. They are my babies.
-I have to say having me here

01:41:40.795 --> 01:41:42.829
is a bit of a stretch, isn't it?

01:41:42.831 --> 01:41:44.130
No.

01:41:44.132 --> 01:41:47.533
I think I can even make
you fit into my happy ending.

01:41:52.173 --> 01:41:54.841
-Hi, you.
-Hi.

01:41:56.144 --> 01:42:00.847
Now you know, I'm not into
costumes or characters

01:42:00.849 --> 01:42:04.150
or theme weddings,
and yet here I am.

01:42:04.152 --> 01:42:06.786
You got to have your way
with me, why don't I get to
have my way with you?

01:42:06.788 --> 01:42:09.322
I guess I don't
have any choice now, do I?

01:42:09.591 --> 01:42:10.490
No.

01:42:10.492 --> 01:42:11.891
[Carrie chuckling]

01:42:17.866 --> 01:42:19.799
You know what I wish
you talked to me about more?

01:42:19.801 --> 01:42:21.801
[Carrie] What, honey?

01:42:22.904 --> 01:42:24.137
My mother.

01:42:27.175 --> 01:42:28.141
And my father.

01:42:28.376 --> 01:42:30.476
Yes, your mama.

01:42:30.845 --> 01:42:37.884
You know,
before she met your dad
she was into my Frank.

01:42:37.886 --> 01:42:41.888
-[laughs] I know.
-She liked him, but he liked me

01:42:41.890 --> 01:42:44.690
and that made things a little
bumpy between me and her,

01:42:44.692 --> 01:42:46.559
you know, the girlfriend thing.

01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:51.764
But then she met your father
and they fell madly in love.

01:42:52.634 --> 01:42:54.534
And they made you.

01:42:54.536 --> 01:42:56.669
It was such a happy time.

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.420
[camera timer beeping]

01:43:26.267 --> 01:43:28.401

[birds chirping]

01:43:52.827 --> 01:43:56.295
[crying] I will always wonder

01:43:58.733 --> 01:44:01.300
-if that's the reason.
-[Carrie] No.

01:44:01.302 --> 01:44:02.401
Why you helped me publish.

01:44:02.403 --> 01:44:06.806
No, no, I told you I love it.

01:44:06.808 --> 01:44:09.475
And how many times
did I say it to you?

01:44:09.477 --> 01:44:11.310
That I'm the only one
that can bring them back.

01:44:11.312 --> 01:44:12.912
Exactly.

01:44:12.914 --> 01:44:14.580
You know them so well.

01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:16.983
Oh, God know that
they're up in heaven

01:44:16.985 --> 01:44:19.352
smiling down on you, so proud.

01:44:19.854 --> 01:44:21.354
And you know what?

01:44:21.356 --> 01:44:23.422
Stories never die.

01:44:23.424 --> 01:44:25.258
So now they're immortalized.

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:28.461
Isn't that great how life works?

01:44:31.733 --> 01:44:33.933
-Thank you.
-[Carrie chuckles]

01:44:33.935 --> 01:44:35.868
Love you, honey.

01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:36.802
Mmm.

01:44:37.572 --> 01:44:38.838
Sweet girl.

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:40.439
Now be happy.

01:44:40.441 --> 01:44:42.508
This is a great day.

01:45:35.663 --> 01:45:37.363
Easy to say here.

01:45:38.933 --> 01:45:41.000
There's no place more public.

01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:43.602
