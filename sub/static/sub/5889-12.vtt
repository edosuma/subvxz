00:02.080 --> 00:04.651
"Since Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar...

00:04.840 --> 00:07.810
...he and his two daughters
settled in the hill country...

00:08.000 --> 00:10.048
...where he lived in a cave.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.851
The firstborn said to the younger:

00:13.040 --> 00:17.284
'Our father is getting old
and there is not a man in the land...

00:17.480 --> 00:22.361
...to have intercourse with us
as is the custom everywhere.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.363
Come. Let us ply our father with wine
and then lie with him...

00:28.560 --> 00:33.327
...that we may ensure
posterity by our father.'

00:33.520 --> 00:37.081
So that night,
they plied their father with wine.

00:38.480 --> 00:41.882
And the firstborn went in
and lay with her father.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.845
The next day,
the firstborn said to the younger:

00:45.040 --> 00:50.206
'Let us ply him
with wine again tonight.

00:50.440 --> 00:55.128
And then you go in and lie with him.'

00:55.360 --> 01:00.685
So that night too,
they plied their father with wine.

01:00.880 --> 01:06.762
And then the younger one went in
and lay with her father.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.281
And so it was that the two daughters
of Lot became pregnant by their father."

01:13.480 --> 01:18.884
And thus, Lord,
we maketh your word our command!

01:19.080 --> 01:20.286
Amen!

Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here in the sight of God...

01:58.760 --> 02:01.889
...and in the face of this family
to join together this...

02:34.720 --> 02:38.520
What do you feel like, Italian, Thai?

02:38.760 --> 02:42.651
- Are we really gonna do this?
- Do what? I'm hungry.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.367
- Not talk about it.
- I'll probably get turned down.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.964
The trial... Nobody gets in this thing.
It's false hope.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.891
Did you hear what the doctor said?
Were you even listening?

02:53.080 --> 02:56.289
- I mean, he said the prognosis is...
- He said he couldn't predict.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.721
No, he said that the trial
was your best shot.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.890
You don't want to do it, fine.
Do it for me. I can live with that.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.163
- I just want to think about it.
- There's nothing to think about.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.161
I don't care if you get fat.
I don't care if you lose your hair.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.330
You're applying for this trial.
You're gonna be accepted.

03:13.520 --> 03:18.162
Do you understand me?
I am not losing you.

03:19.640 --> 03:23.531
As soon as I get to the office,
I'll make the call.

03:35.760 --> 03:40.926
DMV? Really?
I've never even seen you drive.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.444
That little fella, the one through
the glass, his name is Glen Carter.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.405
His mother calls him Jelly Bean.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.762
A loathsome individual
who, sad to say...

03:51.160 --> 03:54.004
...possesses an uncanny ability
to locate anything.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.851
I presume you've heard
of Justin Kenyon?

04:06.040 --> 04:09.681
The smiling public face of
The Militia Movement. Who hasn't?

04:09.880 --> 04:15.250
Yes. The very voice of reason,
the rebel darling of the fringe right...

04:15.480 --> 04:19.166
...charming, rustic, camera-ready,
the perfect spokesman...

04:19.399 --> 04:23.200
...to spin vile hatred and prejudice
into treacly dross...

04:23.400 --> 04:25.402
...that passes for plainspoken
common sense.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.444
- Forget it.
- Excuse me?

04:28.640 --> 04:31.928
Justice knows exactly who
Justin Kenyon is. We know what he is.

04:32.160 --> 04:36.802
The Church of the Shield is a cesspool
of polygamy, doomsday paranoia...

04:37.040 --> 04:39.202
...ritualized elder and child abuse...

04:39.400 --> 04:42.449
...but he also has four of the most
prominent civil rights attorneys...

04:42.640 --> 04:44.961
...in the country on retainer.
We can't touch him.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.322
How do you suppose he pays
for those lawyers?

04:47.520 --> 04:50.046
- Charitable contributions?
- His church has been audited...

04:50.240 --> 04:54.802
...by the IRS every year for the past
decade. His books are impeccable.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.485
So are mine.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.010
Justin Kenyon,
head of The Church of the Shield...

05:02.200 --> 05:06.842
...a polygamist cult located
on a 15,000-acre reserve...

05:07.040 --> 05:08.451
...in the Smoky Mountains.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.644
Kenyon declared it a nation-state
and petitioned to secede in court...

05:11.840 --> 05:14.002
- ...three decades ago.
- According to Reddington...

05:14.200 --> 05:17.010
...Kenyon has dozens of shipping
containers buried on his property.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.885
Terrorists, cartels and criminals
contract with him...

05:20.080 --> 05:21.923
...to store cargo, no questions asked.

05:22.120 --> 05:25.408
Reddington compiled a partial inventory
from his sources.

05:25.600 --> 05:29.207
It includes all manner of contraband,
from drugs and hot merchandise...

05:29.400 --> 05:33.530
...to military ordnance, antiaircraft guns,
missiles, RPGs, Semtex.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.849
Sounds like a one-stop storage facility
for the criminal underworld.

05:37.040 --> 05:41.523
In 1982, Kenyon published a book
entitled The Silver Bear Prophecies...

05:41.720 --> 05:45.930
...which he purported were delivered to him
by the spirit of an ancient druid elder.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.805
In it, he claims to be
the latter-day incarnation...

05:49.000 --> 05:52.288
...of an entity the Silver Bear
called "the Ken'yon."

05:52.480 --> 05:55.324
- How convenient.
- Ken'yon and his followers...

05:55.520 --> 05:59.764
...will ascend into heaven for six days
and return to, and I quote:

06:00.000 --> 06:04.847
"Rain fire upon the new Babylon,
the defiled States of America...

06:05.040 --> 06:07.520
...and our children shall cleanse
her streets...

06:07.760 --> 06:09.762
...with the blood
of her founder's enemies."

06:09.960 --> 06:13.009
According to Reddington,
Kenyon has fallen off the radar.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.089
His clients have been unable
to reach him...

06:15.280 --> 06:17.567
...or anyone on the compound
since last Saturday.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.491
Which means they don't have access
to their stored goods.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.082
As you can imagine, this makes
a number of very dangerous people...

06:24.320 --> 06:25.765
...very, very nervous.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.209
Not interested. Can't be done.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.846
Glen, you have found things for me
with far less to go on.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.811
Ernie's retirement party's tonight.
I got to pick up the shrimp.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.169
You found Jerry Minkie's wife
after she ran off with the Uber driver...

06:39.360 --> 06:41.761
...the one with the Subaru.
- I don't even like shrimp.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.923
You found the, uh, other guy,
who was that?

06:44.120 --> 06:47.203
That mobster who was hiding out
in Needles.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.131
Glen, look, you and l...

06:50.320 --> 06:54.370
We've had our differences but I have
enormous respect for your abilities.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.126
You know that.
If anyone can help me, it's you.

06:57.320 --> 07:01.928
It's not the shrimp. It's the dip,
that sauce. I don't like sauces.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.050
Forget it. I don't need this.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.608
- What are you so upset about?
- There isn't a retirement party, is there?

07:08.800 --> 07:10.962
You're making it up.
That's what this is about.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.329
This is what you want,
to see me get all lathered up.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.807
You're pathological.
You realize that, right?

07:17.040 --> 07:19.771
Ernie's shrimp platter?
You can't be serious.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.082
Do you even see the irony in that?

07:26.640 --> 07:30.326
- Tell me about the safe.
- Glen, I'm upset.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.410
Your spook friend,
he said it was critical.

07:43.400 --> 07:47.246
As I've already told you, he said
there is a safe in St. Petersburg...

07:47.480 --> 07:51.565
...on the second floor of I don't know
where, a bank, an apartment.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.683
He died before he could tell me more.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.248
The spook, what was his name?

07:58.240 --> 08:02.040
- Alan Fitch.
- Alan...

08:03.480 --> 08:06.211
- Fitch!
- Fitch!

08:08.600 --> 08:10.807
Kenyon's been off the grid
for three days.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.241
According to his own words,
that gives us 72 hours...

08:13.440 --> 08:15.488
...before he delivers his version
of Armageddon.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.722
His counsel has assured us
nothing is amiss...

08:17.920 --> 08:21.242
...and under no circumstances
are we to attempt direct contact.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.649
They already won two civil judgments
on Kenyon's behalf for harassment.

08:24.840 --> 08:26.444
He's sitting on enough ordnance...

08:26.640 --> 08:29.086
...to arm a third-world country.
- This could go south...

08:29.320 --> 08:31.766
...and end up looking very badly.
- I don't give a damn.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.520
Well, that's a luxury we cannot afford,
not after Waco and Ruby Ridge.

08:35.720 --> 08:40.282
We're looking at a tactical nightmare,
78 square miles of virgin forest...

08:40.480 --> 08:43.370
...a mountain stronghold
with enough food and potable water...

08:43.559 --> 08:45.801
...to withstand an armed siege
for months.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.725
And even if by some miracle
we manage to put down resistance...

08:48.960 --> 08:51.201
...and seize that compound
without loss of life...

08:51.400 --> 08:54.961
...without harm coming to
the 26 children who reside there...

08:55.160 --> 08:56.650
...what if Reddington is wrong?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.763
Lizzy, exactly when have I been wrong?

08:58.960 --> 09:01.361
I told you,
there are political considerations.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.080
If we raid Kenyon's compound
and come up empty-handed...

09:04.280 --> 09:06.521
- You will not come up empty-handed.
- But if we do...

09:06.720 --> 09:08.927
...then we'll have validated
Kenyon's allegations...

09:09.120 --> 09:11.487
...that the government
are a pack of jackbooted thugs.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.126
We'll have raised him up
as a martyr for the Constitution.

09:14.360 --> 09:15.850
That's exactly what he wants.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.804
I have gone to considerable lengths...

09:18.000 --> 09:20.401
...to point you and your team
in the right direction...

09:20.600 --> 09:25.606
...and now, due to political
considerations, people will die.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.565
And when they do
and the bureaucrats decide...

09:28.760 --> 09:31.889
...that the loss of innocent lives
trumps their career prospects...

09:32.080 --> 09:34.162
...you be sure to give me a call.

09:42.560 --> 09:46.406
Unit B61 to Dispatch, run a check
on a late-model Chevy van...

09:46.640 --> 09:51.487
...Tennessee plate number
Delta-Oscar-Charlie-7-7-1.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.721
Unit
B261, that tag number is 10-40 stolen...

09:56.920 --> 10:00.049
...registered to a 2005 Jeep Cherokee.
Copy?

10:00.280 --> 10:01.964
Copy that.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.328
Show us your hands!

10:08.960 --> 10:11.247
Hands outside the window now!

10:15.560 --> 10:16.607
What the...

10:17.240 --> 10:20.130
Hold your fire! It's just a...

10:27.120 --> 10:29.885
ATF estimates there was
enough Semtex in that van...

10:30.080 --> 10:31.411
...to level five blocks.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.400
- Anything on the victims?
- Vaporized.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.722
The presumed dead include
two Alabama state troopers...

10:35.920 --> 10:36.967
...and the occupant of the van.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.487
Yeah?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.603
We just got footage of the explosion.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.201
Hold your fire! It's just a...

10:45.400 --> 10:46.606
It's just a what?

10:46.800 --> 10:48.600
VIN numbers on the van's differential...

10:48.720 --> 10:51.007
...match a vehicle
registered to Kenyon's church.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.328
Judge is signing a search warrant
as we speak.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.444
Also, the plates were swapped out
for one stolen off a Cherokee...

10:56.640 --> 10:59.246
...at a truck stop five miles
from the Kenyon compound.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.922
I got a hit on another set of plates
stolen from the same location.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.681
Another van passed through a tollbooth
on the MD 200 headed into D.C.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.840
Reddington was right. If we'd listened...

11:08.880 --> 11:12.521
...we wouldn't have fanatics joyriding
with enough ordnance to level a small city.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.370
Ressler and Keen,
get to that compound.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.210
Warrant should be
sealed and delivered.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.171
Navabi, the van.
Find out everything you can.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.244
Harold Cooper.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.407
Dr. Levin, hello.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.408
Was I accepted?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.604
I see.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.251
You know, Jeff,
you don't owe me an apology.

11:40.440 --> 11:45.731
I know you did everything you could.
Thank you.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.849
Hey, I just got off the phone
with the doctor.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.850
I'm afraid it's bad news.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.691
I am not taking you to St. Petersburg.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.484
You are if you want to know
where the safe is.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.081
- How do I even know you've found it?
- You don't.

12:10.280 --> 12:14.080
But I got two weeks of vacation I got to take
before the end of the year or I lose it.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.362
- It's February.
- We could take your jet...

12:16.560 --> 12:20.406
...have a few laughs on the way, some
of those nuts, the honey-roasted ones.

12:20.600 --> 12:26.130
I want what I paid for,
the location of the safe.

12:26.320 --> 12:29.051
- Can I be honest with you?
- I doubt it.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.444
I've never been out of the country.

12:34.280 --> 12:40.811
My dad, our vacations as a kid, we drove
everywhere, South Dakota, Florida.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.970
But you, I look at you...

12:44.200 --> 12:47.443
...and all the places you go...

12:49.640 --> 12:54.248
...and I'd just like to do that once.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.525
Plus, I think it'd be fun.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.883
I feel like we might have a good time.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.321
I'm screwing with you.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.689
I was born in London
but I've never been on a private jet.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.484
Ahem, anyway, I clock out at 5:30.

13:21.680 --> 13:25.401
I'll need to stop by the house,
grab a shower, feed the turtle.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.604
I can have a bag packed
and be wheels up by 9.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.450
Sheriff, have you met Kenyon?

13:34.640 --> 13:37.120
He makes a habit of coming into town
for breakfast.

13:37.320 --> 13:40.608
He's a bit of a blowhard
but always friendly, cooperative.

13:40.840 --> 13:44.162
Plus, the church has provided
volunteers for community events...

13:44.360 --> 13:46.010
...search-and-rescue operations.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.441
So, what are you suggesting,
we collar this guy...

13:48.680 --> 13:50.364
...at the next Rotary Club breakfast?

13:50.600 --> 13:53.763
I'm suggesting he can
be talked to. He's reasonable...

13:53.960 --> 13:56.247
...and I'm suggesting
you let my boys handle this...

13:56.480 --> 13:59.563
...instead of lighting this mountain up
and starting World War Ill.

13:59.760 --> 14:02.331
What are the odds
we'll be met with armed resistance?

14:02.520 --> 14:04.124
It's a dead certainty.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.921
You step one foot on Kenyon's land
without his express consent...

14:08.120 --> 14:11.329
...he'll put a bullet in you,
badge or no badge.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.164
We've cleared the estimated kill zone,
evacuated surrounding areas.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.681
We're waiting on a sniper team now.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.886
Hold your fire. It's just...

14:29.440 --> 14:31.408
...a kid.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.608
It's just a kid.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.964
- Excuse me, miss?
- Take this.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.606
Hey, hold on. Hey, halt. No!

14:42.760 --> 14:46.685
Return to the firing line.
Do not approach the suspect.

14:46.880 --> 14:51.169
Return to the firing line.
Do not approach the suspect.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.009
Hi.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.724
I'm Samar. What's your name?

15:07.960 --> 15:09.246
Do you know what that does?

15:11.680 --> 15:14.001
You planned on killing
a lot of people today.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.925
Was that your mission?

15:19.520 --> 15:22.444
It's not going to happen. Do you see?

15:24.800 --> 15:26.484
They're all too far away.

15:27.320 --> 15:31.211
There's no point now.
It's just the two of us out here.

15:31.800 --> 15:36.761
If you push that button,
only two of us are going to die.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.680
Do you understand?

15:38.880 --> 15:43.408
Just you and me,
and I don't want to die today.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.683
Do you?

15:58.360 --> 16:01.523
Come on out. Come on.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.845
Come here, give me your hand.
It's gonna be okay.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.520
Kenyon's unaccounted for.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.165
Fifty-three of his followers
slaughtered.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.886
- No sign of him.
- That's puzzling.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.402
It appears all the adults were murdered
and the children are gone.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.685
Kenyon's ideology has always been
about vanquishing the infidels...

17:34.880 --> 17:39.010
...and rising to power, not about killing
their own. This is a group of survivalists.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.481
They might have been attacked
by a rival militia.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.206
We found a number of dead bodies
surrounding the perimeter.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.320
- And the storage containers?
- Located, secured and searched...

17:47.400 --> 17:50.847
...about a dozen of them so far.
They've been pretty much cleaned out.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.441
No weapons, no ordnance.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.361
According to an inventory list,
we're missing small arms, RPGs...

17:57.560 --> 18:03.761
...three Hellfire missiles, plus over a ton
of Semtex, C-4, Demix and Plastite.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.448
- What was that?
- That was a vase.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.085
What about the vehicles?

18:10.280 --> 18:13.329
All the church's vehicles
are accounted for, except for one.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.531
Another bomb.
Something's gone sideways, Lizzy.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.964
Kenyon is the devil we know
but now either others are involved...

18:22.200 --> 18:24.931
...or there's been a complete breakdown
in the organization.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.686
Either way, be careful out there.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.851
- This is the apartment?
- This is the apartment.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.008
- You're positive?
- Your tone is insulting.

18:36.200 --> 18:41.001
My tone?
I endured 13 hours with you on my jet...

18:41.200 --> 18:43.885
...12 of which you had your shoes off.
You snored.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.209
- You insulted my flight attendant.
- I thought she was pregnant.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.051
Glen, the safe.
We haven't found it yet, have we?

18:50.240 --> 18:53.050
I know everything one can possibly
know about Alan Fitch.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.924
I worked on this around the clock...

18:55.120 --> 18:58.283
...and you know how irritable I can be
if I don't get my 10 hours.

18:58.480 --> 19:02.849
I've reviewed six years of bank records
and I traced the cash payment he made...

19:03.040 --> 19:09.002
...to purchase an apartment
in this very building on this very floor.

19:09.440 --> 19:13.126
- Trust me, the safe is here.
- I don't trust you.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.682
- What the hell is this?
- The title to Apartment 221.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.891
Apology accepted.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.287
- What?
- We're in Apartment 212.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.604
You don't know the cross that I bear...

19:37.800 --> 19:40.963
...the things I've had to overcome,
my dyslexia.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.690
- You're not dyslexic.
- Raymond.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.362
Oh, really, doctor?
Is that your professional opinion?

19:46.560 --> 19:48.289
Forgot to pack my medication.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.404
I was shocked when you told me
I could come along. It threw me.

19:51.600 --> 19:55.321
- I left my dyslexia pills on the counter.
- There are no pills for dyslexia.

20:01.440 --> 20:04.410
Get this to Sorenson for a trace
on the number.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.009
- How old is he?
- He's 10.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.043
Ten? What the hell
are we dealing with here?

20:09.240 --> 20:12.210
I've seen this in fanatical sects.
The children are indoctrinated...

20:12.440 --> 20:14.807
...from the time they're born...

20:15.000 --> 20:18.322
...in this case,
the gospel according to Justin Kenyon.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.841
To rain fire upon the new Babylon.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.964
Coroner's preliminary report
on the massacre at the compound.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.840
- What do you got?
- Not a shot fired.

20:25.960 --> 20:29.282
Every single one of those people
was stabbed, strangled, stomped...

20:29.480 --> 20:31.289
...or bludgeoned to death.
- Dear God.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.529
And something else. A field office
in Richmond just got a call...

20:34.720 --> 20:37.849
...from a former cult member,
Dawn Weston.

20:38.040 --> 20:41.169
Swears our truck bomber is her son.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.249
She's our only surviving witness.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.568
Of a crime committed in my jurisdiction.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.849
- That makes her my responsibility.
- These are dangerous people.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.441
We have an entire unit
tasked with providing protection.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.968
There's no point in hashing this out now.
No matter how this shakes down...

20:55.160 --> 20:59.961
...the first thing we need to do is get
that girl safely off this mountain, agreed?

21:11.640 --> 21:14.644
- What are you looking at?
- Watchers.

21:15.520 --> 21:19.286
- Watchers?
- Shh. It's a secret.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.682
- I thought he was dead.
- Your son, Finnian.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.803
Finn, we always called him.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.167
Finn.

21:45.400 --> 21:49.166
There are some things that you need
to understand about Justin...

21:49.360 --> 21:51.124
...about the way that things were.

21:51.320 --> 21:57.202
You see, his word was not just the law.
It was the word of God himself.

21:57.400 --> 22:01.724
Justin was our oracle.
He was our burning bush.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.849
- I understand.
- You don't.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.725
You can't, not unless you were there.
You...

22:07.560 --> 22:11.281
- God, what have I done?
- Tell me.

22:16.800 --> 22:23.524
According to Justin, each man
was to take unto himself three wives.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.961
Which wasn't a problem
in the early days...

22:26.160 --> 22:30.768
...but as we began to have children,
he must've seen the flaw in his plan.

22:30.960 --> 22:34.487
- What flaw?
- There were too many boys, of course.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.684
More than half the children were,
you know, male...

22:37.880 --> 22:42.647
...and so he began the walkabout.
- The Walkabout?

22:42.880 --> 22:47.044
The first new moon in January,
lots would be drawn among the boys.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.210
We would have a great feast
in celebration...

22:50.400 --> 22:53.244
...and the chosen one
would be the guest of honor.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.726
He was treated as a man.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.720
- How old were the chosen?
- Eight or 10.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.968
Just before the onset of puberty.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.891
After the feast,
the boy would be awakened...

23:04.080 --> 23:06.560
...and taken deep into the woods
and then...

23:06.760 --> 23:10.970
You left him there in the
middle of nowhere, in the bitter cold.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.521
He said there were too many.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.890
- You're hurt.
- Ah, I'm okay. Ressler's pinned.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.287
Ressler, talk to me. You injured?

23:31.480 --> 23:34.165
I don't think anything's broke
but I'm stuck. I can't...

23:34.360 --> 23:36.203
I can't budge this thing.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.211
The radio's shot.

23:41.640 --> 23:45.406
- Anybody got cell reception?
- Mine's busted.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.683
- Somebody live back there?
- Not that I know of.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.450
You wait by the car with Amy.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.927
I'll see if I can get help,
check out that smoke.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.407
Keep an eye on that girl.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.289
Shouldn't you be prepping
for your confirmation hearing?

24:14.480 --> 24:18.849
Heh, it's a no-brainer. You're looking
at the next attorney general.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.647
- I'm happy for you, Tom.
- For us, Harold, for us.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.411
I want you to consider
taking the director's chair.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.961
- Tom, I don't know.
- It's what we've always talked about.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.162
A rising tide lifts all boats.

24:34.800 --> 24:38.930
I'm flattered, Tom, but I can't.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.162
I'm not leaving here with a "no."

24:41.360 --> 24:44.523
I'd love to take you up on this, Tom.
You know I would.

24:44.720 --> 24:48.770
But I'm dealing with
some health issues.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.282
What, Harold? Is it serious?

24:52.480 --> 24:56.644
To be honest with you, yeah.
It's very serious.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.443
There was a clinical trial
that held out some hope but, uh...

25:08.280 --> 25:11.170
Look, you didn't come here
to talk about my health.

25:11.400 --> 25:15.564
I'm happy for you. I really am.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.769
- Are you in the FBI?
- Yes, I am.

25:35.960 --> 25:40.045
My daddy says all the people
who work for the FBI are gonna go to hell.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.083
Some days it feels like that,
sweetheart.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.567
He says they're gonna burn
in a lake of fire.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.087
Who's there?

25:51.240 --> 25:52.321
What is it?

25:52.520 --> 25:54.363
Shh.

25:56.560 --> 26:00.610
- Hey, Starkweather!
- Shh, it's them.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.768
- Who?
- The watchers.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.571
Sweetie, come here.

26:13.720 --> 26:14.960
Get down, get down!

26:34.440 --> 26:38.286
The only cure for corruption is disruption.
The only cure for corruption is disruption.

26:38.480 --> 26:42.280
The only cure for corruption is disruption.
The only cure for corruption is disruption.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.326
The only cure for corruption is disruption.
The only cure for corruption is disruption.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.409
The only cure for corruption is disruption.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.443
- The only cure for...
- Finn.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.410
The father said to his servants,
"Quick, put a ring on his finger...

26:54.600 --> 26:57.251
...and sandals on his feet."
- Do you remember me?

27:06.120 --> 27:08.726
- Mama?
- Yes, Finn.

27:15.240 --> 27:19.325
You're telling me that this attack
was masterminded by a bunch of kids?

27:19.520 --> 27:22.683
Not just kids, a tribe,
militarily instructed by their elders...

27:22.880 --> 27:25.963
...from the time they could walk
in tracking, evasion techniques...

27:26.200 --> 27:28.282
...hand-to-hand combat,
firearm training.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.563
- And left to die in the woods?
- Starting with Kenyon's own son, David.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.807
Why?

27:33.040 --> 27:34.769
The gospel according to Kenyon:

27:35.000 --> 27:37.367
"And each man shall
have unto himself three wives."

27:37.560 --> 27:40.723
There were too many boys.
It was the only way to maintain the ratio.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.526
The mountain was supposed
to kill the boys but it didn't.

27:43.760 --> 27:47.003
It was a crucible. The weak died,
injuries, disease, exposure...

27:48.440 --> 27:51.569
...but the strong survived,
perfectly adapted, with their own laws...

27:51.760 --> 27:55.207
...their own society, their own gods,
chief among which was Justin Kenyon.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.522
- "Was"?
- David is their leader.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.927
A few weeks ago,
he declared his father an apostate.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.963
He said Justin had abandoned
his calling...

28:02.200 --> 28:05.044
...and that it was up to them
to fulfill the prophecies of Ken'yon.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.487
He tell you where this
final truck bomb was headed?

28:07.840 --> 28:10.730
The only people who know
are the other drivers and David.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.321
I can't raise Liz or Ressler.

28:14.560 --> 28:18.201
Samar, my dear, bump in the road
I can help smooth over...

28:18.400 --> 28:21.131
...or have the clouds finally parted
and this is a social call?

28:21.320 --> 28:22.810
- She's missing.
- Agent Keen?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.731
And Ressler. They were supposed
to deliver a witness hours ago.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.207
Haven't been seen
since they left Kenyon's compound.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.131
- Have you mounted a search?
- I'm on my way out to assist HRT...

28:31.320 --> 28:33.891
...but there are hundreds
of square miles of rugged terrain.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.411
It could take days.

28:35.600 --> 28:39.969
The weapons. Agent Keen said
there was a complete inventory list.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.561
- Do you have it?
- Well, we have a manifest. Why?

28:42.760 --> 28:44.205
Send it to me.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.611
Ressler?

29:39.120 --> 29:43.170
- Raymond. Ooh!
- Oh, that's a shame.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.728
- Dendrobium?
- My own hybrid.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.845
- I call them Snows of Everest.
- Lovely.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.408
- Friend of yours?
- A small accounting problem.

29:53.640 --> 30:00.444
Ruth. Ruth. I'm afraid I'll need
your undivided attention.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.803
Put on his parka. Tie him
from the back of the snowmobile.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.007
I'll be out in a minute.
Very well. You have my attention.

30:13.320 --> 30:18.724
Ruth, I will be forever indebted to you
if you could be so kind...

30:18.960 --> 30:22.521
...as to provide me with the activation
codes for the Hellfire missiles...

30:22.720 --> 30:25.326
...you have stored
at Justin Kenyon's compound.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.324
Yes.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.725
- Are you Navabi?
- Yeah.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.285
It's for you.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.127
This is Samar.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.891
Agent Navabi, what do you know
about Hellfire missiles?

30:39.080 --> 30:41.200
- What's that have to do with anything?
- Quite a lot.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.368
There were three stolen
from the compound.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.688
I've since acquired
their activation codes.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.848
You're going to launch
three Hellfire missiles?

30:48.040 --> 30:52.011
Heh, don't be silly. We just activated
the cameras in their nose cones.

30:52.240 --> 30:55.449
I've seen quite a lot of activity,
but then, boys will be boys.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.244
- Liz and Ressler?
- Not sure.

30:57.440 --> 31:02.128
I have two other views,
only one of any tactical value.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.847
It looks like they're in some sort
of large hand-built structure.

31:06.040 --> 31:08.088
- Where?
- Funny you should ask.

31:08.280 --> 31:12.888
In standby mode, the guidance systems
ping GPS coordinates every 30 seconds.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.363
- You ready?
- Go.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.929
Hey.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.329
Who are you?

31:39.240 --> 31:40.969
My name's Elizabeth.

32:20.120 --> 32:23.249
This isn't about me or
the others, Father. This is about you!

32:23.440 --> 32:28.685
Your legacy, not mine.
You think I haven't seen it?

32:30.200 --> 32:34.569
Read it?
Prevarications and betrayals.

32:34.960 --> 32:38.885
- Tell me who you are. Who's in charge?
- Ken'yon.

32:39.080 --> 32:42.368
- I want to talk to him.
- Only David talks to Ken'yon.

32:42.600 --> 32:47.481
- You disgust me.
- David! David!

32:48.320 --> 32:53.884
- What? What?!
- The prisoner wants to talk to you.

33:03.280 --> 33:07.330
Caleb, watch the road.
Make sure nobody else comes.

33:09.960 --> 33:14.090
- Where are the others?
- Amy's safe, along with the others.

33:14.280 --> 33:19.969
She's gonna be one of my wives.
We're all gonna get married, all of us...

33:20.160 --> 33:21.889
...as prescribed by Ken'yon.

33:22.080 --> 33:26.449
And the man? Ressler?
What have you done with him?

33:49.000 --> 33:52.686
See? He's alive.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.606
Freeze! Move away from him!
Step away from him!

34:16.360 --> 34:17.565
I said freeze!

34:20.280 --> 34:23.648
- Federal agents! Freeze, freeze!
- Get on the ground!

34:25.600 --> 34:28.570
- Let's go!
- Don't move.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.320
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Kenyon's upstairs.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.568
- Get this guy right here.
- Yeah.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.482
He's gone.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.643
Kenyon.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.527
Stand down. We found the...

34:56.520 --> 35:01.162
- What?
- The third van.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.608
Get these kids out of here.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.723
See if you can locate
those missing girls.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.610
They've got to be around here
somewhere.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.251
- Call for backup.
- No backup.

35:18.440 --> 35:21.410
Just round up these kids with
the personnel we've got and clear out.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.005
Yes, ma'am.

35:24.600 --> 35:28.650
Don't come any closer! I've got
300 pounds of explosives in this van!

35:31.240 --> 35:34.881
Go ahead.
It's what he wanted, isn't it?

35:35.360 --> 35:40.685
- What do you know?
- I know your father wanted you dead.

35:43.640 --> 35:48.851
He sent us out there to make us stronger,
to be warriors, to fulfill his prophecy.

35:49.080 --> 35:53.244
All those boys, they wouldn't have
made it if it weren't for you...

35:53.920 --> 35:57.163
...taking them in,
teaching them how to survive.

35:57.560 --> 36:02.282
Your father never wanted them.
He never wanted you.

36:04.080 --> 36:09.371
But you're not your father, David.
You're better than him.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.248
You're right.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.883
- I am.
- Coward!

36:52.880 --> 36:56.441
ATF's been over the grounds.
They've searched the buried containers.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.770
If you're wondering about
what you stored there, it's long gone.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.922
- What's this?
- A key.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.805
I bought you an apartment
at the Audrey...

37:11.040 --> 37:15.364
...top floor,
splendid view of the Potomac.

37:15.840 --> 37:19.925
- Why?
- It's time to leave the motel behind.

37:23.880 --> 37:27.168
I'm happy where I am. Thank you.

37:27.360 --> 37:31.410
You've been many things lately, Lizzy,
but happy is not one of them.

37:31.640 --> 37:35.850
That motor lodge you call home
crushes the spirit, smothers the soul.

37:36.040 --> 37:38.805
And you think a view
is gonna change that?

37:40.240 --> 37:46.407
I once stayed at a villa in Bali
with a view of the Indian Ocean.

37:47.200 --> 37:51.728
Every morning,
all I saw before me was...

37:53.400 --> 37:55.482
...possibility.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.729
That and a gorgeous housekeeper
named Putu, who...

38:00.960 --> 38:02.405
Thanks, but, no, thanks.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.449
- I wish you'd stop.
- Stop what?

38:09.880 --> 38:14.283
Trying. Stop hoping things
are gonna get better between us.

38:14.520 --> 38:19.845
You and me, it's just business.
That's all it's ever gonna be.

40:11.080 --> 40:15.369
Tom, I thought I was clear. I appreciate
you thinking I'd be a good director but...

40:15.600 --> 40:18.604
Screw the director.
I got you into the trial.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.691
- At Georgetown.
- What?

40:22.720 --> 40:25.530
- How?
- Heh, good questions.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.404
I know a guy who knows a guy.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.885
Wait.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.530
Am I taking another patient's spot?

40:39.720 --> 40:42.007
Because I couldn't accept that.
That wouldn't be right.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.647
Heh. Righteous to the end. Relax.

40:45.880 --> 40:48.929

41:07.480 --> 41:10.404
And may they always be.

41:33.760 --> 41:36.206
The number from the safe
traces to a blind exchange.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.483
We can't identify the party
you'll be speaking to.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.965
Yes?

42:06.920 --> 42:09.446
I'm calling on behalf of Alan Fitch.

42:09.640 --> 42:13.645
The safe. You found the safe?

42:14.960 --> 42:16.962
