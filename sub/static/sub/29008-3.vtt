WEBVTT

00:14.040 --> 00:15.520
Can I have a decaf, please?

00:21.640 --> 00:23.760
"Hello, this is
Mariví's answering machine.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.160
When you hear the beep,
you can leave a message."

00:27.080 --> 00:29.040
Mum, I've just finished. It's...

00:34.240 --> 00:36.640
Excuse me, do you have a phone charger?

00:36.920 --> 00:37.920
No.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.520
Do you want to use mine?

00:46.920 --> 00:49.600
20 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

00:51.920 --> 00:54.200
-Really? Don't you mind?
-No, no.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.240
Are you sure? Thanks.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.240
I have to make a couple of calls.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.680
-It's all right.
-Thanks a lot.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.200
SATURDAY 6:25 AM

01:10.640 --> 01:12.720
Mum, I've just finished, I'm on my way.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.240
"Superintendent Sánchez,
leave your message."

01:20.440 --> 01:23.280
This is inspector Murillo.
I know it's late,

01:23.360 --> 01:26.480
but I wanted to tell that,
if Intelligence is in charge,

01:26.560 --> 01:29.080
due to I don't know
which type of diplomatic interests,

01:29.640 --> 01:33.560
I'm not going to be your figurehead
while those thugs force their way there.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.840
So I feel obliged...

01:36.320 --> 01:38.920
to resign. Good night.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.240
Good morning.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.040
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.200
Excuse me, but you're...

02:03.120 --> 02:04.400
It's you...

02:04.840 --> 02:07.280
"I started telling
the story of a kidnapping,

02:07.440 --> 02:09.760
because everybody will remember
those days of siege

02:09.840 --> 02:11.640
in the Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.

02:11.720 --> 02:15.640
The streets downtown were closed, all TV
channels broadcasted live for 24 hours,

02:15.720 --> 02:17.840
the police burnt their academy manuals

02:17.920 --> 02:20.200
and they didn't know
how to eat that pie in the sky

02:20.280 --> 02:23.360
of those poor wretches trying to print
their own money,

02:23.760 --> 02:26.680
but many other things happened
and nobody remembers them,

02:26.760 --> 02:28.120
things that changed us all

02:28.280 --> 02:30.880
to the point of not knowing
who the bad guys were...

02:31.280 --> 02:32.400
and who the good guys were."

02:32.680 --> 02:34.720
Excuse me,
when you negotiate with those people,

02:34.800 --> 02:37.200
do you give them what they want
or do you just have a chinwag

02:37.280 --> 02:38.560
to buy some time or...?

02:40.040 --> 02:42.640
-Well, don't answer me, I just...
-Every case is different.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.320
Sure, I'm sorry.

02:45.640 --> 02:46.560
But...

02:47.960 --> 02:48.920
But well, yes,

02:49.880 --> 02:52.760
we try to calm things down
and buy some time.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.680
Thanks.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.200
"In fact, we were the ones buying time,

02:57.280 --> 03:00.080
the sentence time is money
had never been better used.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.200
A lot of money.

03:02.760 --> 03:04.960
Every hour we printed eight million euros,

03:05.640 --> 03:08.280
1,400 sheets of paper money
from which we cut

03:08.360 --> 03:10.840
140,000 50 euro notes.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.320
Everything was so calm
during the hours of dawn

03:21.400 --> 03:23.280
that it seemed the plan
was going smoothly.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.760
The Professor was our Big Brother.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.520
He controlled the police radio
and 18 cameras,

03:31.560 --> 03:33.520
so if somebody wanted to fuck us,

03:33.960 --> 03:36.120
we'd know it well in advance.

03:41.080 --> 03:45.400
We took turns to watch the hostages,
the entries and of course the production.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.400
After only 20 hours there

03:47.480 --> 03:50.520
the presses had already spit
52 million euros,

03:51.080 --> 03:53.600
so at that point
we all thought it was possible.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.040
But all that calm
was just the calm before the storm.

03:58.120 --> 04:02.360
Things were going to screw up so much, we
would be on the brink of losing the game.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.720
And if you ask me why,

04:05.360 --> 04:07.520
I'll say it's due to a simple love story.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.320
After all, love is a good reason
to make everything go wrong."

05:36.600 --> 05:37.920
I'd like to ask you a favour.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.520
May I?

05:44.320 --> 05:46.440
"There's movement,
everyone get ready."

05:47.280 --> 05:49.360
Deputy inspector,
they're opening the doors.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.160
"There are seven men,
armed with M-16s, sir."

05:58.320 --> 06:00.000
Don't do anything, all right?

06:00.720 --> 06:03.800
-It's a unique opportunity.
-Don't do anything.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.200
Take off your mask.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.720
I'm begging you, please, not to shoot.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.960
My name's Mónica Gaztambide.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.640
She's a hostage.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.280
I'm just here to read a statement.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.640
I'm speaking on behalf of the robbers.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.080
We're 67 hostages,

06:32.680 --> 06:37.400
all of us in perfect health
and well cared of.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.760
There are no victims or wounded.
We're all dressed alike

06:42.600 --> 06:45.280
and it's impossible to tell us
from the robbers,

06:46.680 --> 06:50.160
so any attempts of assault

06:51.600 --> 06:54.200
-could cost the lives...
-"The Dalí with the megaphone

06:54.280 --> 06:57.080
-is giving her orders.
-The one with the megaphone is a robber."

07:00.440 --> 07:01.960
"I request the green light, sir.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.480
Target in range.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.880
They're coming in, last chance, sir.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.640
Last chance, sir.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.920
They're coming in, I repeat,
they're coming in."

07:15.000 --> 07:16.200
No, don't shoot.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.880
Don't shoot, do you hear me? Let them in,

07:19.960 --> 07:23.280
let them go back in.
Do you hear me? Let them in.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.800
"As we have just seen,
the robbers have read a statement

07:28.880 --> 07:31.880
where they said they regret
having hurt the police officers."

07:31.960 --> 07:34.360
It seems the hostages
are in perfect health

07:34.440 --> 07:37.880
"and the assailants
do not intend to use violence."

07:58.720 --> 08:01.960
"My daughter, I know
you don't like Paula sleeping in your bed,

08:02.240 --> 08:04.640
but she insisted
and I didn't want to argue with her.

08:04.720 --> 08:05.880
Don't get angry."

08:37.360 --> 08:38.840
We're locked up

08:39.560 --> 08:42.640
and we really don't know
how long this could last,

08:42.720 --> 08:46.200
but as long as they don't blow
my head up, I'll take care of you.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.560
As long as you don't try to trick me,
or communicate with the outside,

08:51.360 --> 08:52.400
everything will be fine.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.640
From now on we're getting organized.

08:57.840 --> 09:02.040
We're giving you some tasks
so you don't feel down.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.240
-What's your name?
-Pablo.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.800
Do you do any exercise?

09:09.200 --> 09:11.560
Yes, I'm the athletic captain at school.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.480
Step forward, captain.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.000
Step forward.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.240
Man!

09:29.840 --> 09:30.800
Arturito.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.560
-Did you sleep well?
-Well, yes.

09:35.480 --> 09:38.560
Fine. Tell me, are you good at DIY?

09:38.720 --> 09:41.640
No, no, sir, I'm totally hopeless.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.600
In fact, when I have a flat tyre,
my wife changed it.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.920
Are you telling me you don't have a drill?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.480
-No.
-Think carefully what you say,

09:48.560 --> 09:50.880
because I have
a fucking lie detector right here.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.640
Yes.

10:01.720 --> 10:05.960
Let's see... Second chance.
Are you good at DIY?

10:07.320 --> 10:10.000
-I hold my own.
-Step forward.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.600
Would you feel better
if we brought you a tranquilizer?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.960
-Yes, please.
-Very well.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.680
-Does anyone else need medication?
-Me. I'm diabetic.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.320
-Come with Sonsoles, please.
-And me. I'm taking sertraline.

10:32.640 --> 10:33.560
Anyone else?

10:34.440 --> 10:35.320
Me.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.080
I'd like to ask for an abortion pill.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.160
You said you don't know
how many days we'll be here

10:44.320 --> 10:46.280
and I'd like to sort this out
as soon as possible.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.640
You'll get it today. You, come with me,

10:48.720 --> 10:51.760
I'm taking you to Mr Román's office,
you'll be more relaxed there.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
I also have a request.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.520
Yes?

10:57.720 --> 11:00.240
I'd like to erase a picture
from the internet.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.880
I'm sorry, that's not in my hands.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.400
I've been tricked,
they took me to a toilet

11:04.480 --> 11:06.120
and they got a picture of me naked.

11:07.360 --> 11:10.720
And now my parents, my teachers,
all the media are seeing it.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.880
You can record a message,
a video, so they calm down,

11:14.960 --> 11:16.280
and we'll send it.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.920
All of you will be allowed
to record messages for your families.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.440
Nairobi, come on.

11:30.200 --> 11:34.160
Come on, tough guys,
your hands behind your head

11:34.320 --> 11:36.680
and move to the left in a row,
sticking your chests out

11:36.760 --> 11:39.920
as if you were the national team.
Move, athlete.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.160
Do you see this dotted line?

11:43.040 --> 11:46.960
You're going to break the concrete
not going one centimetre away from it,

11:47.320 --> 11:50.840
as if it were a cut-out for children.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.440
There are 48 metres downward
until you get to the sewer pipe.

11:54.520 --> 11:58.320
The shift will last three hours.
And when you finish your shift

11:58.960 --> 12:01.360
and you go back with the hostages,
not a fucking word

12:01.440 --> 12:03.080
about what we're doing down here.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.360
-Any questions?
-No.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.720
That's good, that means I was clear.

12:08.440 --> 12:12.120
Come on, let's get to work.
You, put on the hearing protection

12:12.720 --> 12:15.160
-and take the hammer.
-I've never used one of those.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.840
There's a first time for everything.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.520
And be careful.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.600
You wouldn't be the first one
to lose a foot with that.

12:42.680 --> 12:46.360
-"Dad, mum, I'm fine."
-In Spanish, please.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.840
Hi, dad. Hi, mum.

12:51.560 --> 12:55.720
I'm fine, they feed us
and I've slept in a bag.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.280
Mum, this is not awful, okay?
There's no violence.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.000
"Mum", mum.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.040
I guess you've seen the photo
I uploaded on the internet.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.320
I didn't upload that photo and it doesn't
have to do with the kidnapping,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.600
it was a classmate who tricked me and...

13:18.880 --> 13:19.760
I can't.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.360
Do not give so much importance
to this photo. It's...

13:23.600 --> 13:26.080
It's just like when you go topless
on the beach, you know?

13:26.160 --> 13:27.040
Nobody cares.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.080
I don't go topless on the beach.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.320
And I don't kiss with boys
in the toilets of a museum.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.800
When my arm was put in a cast
it was the most exciting thing

13:37.880 --> 13:39.120
that happened to me this year.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.320
A kidnapping is more exciting.

13:49.960 --> 13:53.400
Well, think about
what you're telling your parents, okay?

13:54.080 --> 13:57.000
And calm down, I'll wait for you. Here.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.840
-You're serious. What's wrong?
-Why the fuck do you care?

14:09.280 --> 14:12.960
I'm just a child, the bedtime hobby
of the last five months, right?

14:16.400 --> 14:17.600
The silly guy with the badge.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.160
I said you were a child
and that I never would be with you

14:21.240 --> 14:23.320
so that you didn't get a bullet
in your breastbone,

14:23.520 --> 14:25.520
because I don't give a damn
if it's me who gets it.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.720
You don't believe that,
you didn't do it for me.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.400
What's the matter with you all?

14:29.880 --> 14:32.080
Since I came here
you're always making scenes.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.760
They've turned on a phone.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.200
It's Alison Parker's.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.000
Hack it.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.480
You know what's up?
I'm sure you waited for us

14:45.560 --> 14:49.320
to get out of Toledo to start with
all this fucking shit that I'm a child.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.880
She's trying to log in in her profile.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.800
Come on, come on.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.960
If I was your fucking gigolo,
just tell me.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.880
You were my fucking gigolo.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.560
You were everything.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.000
-I'm inside.
-Record it.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.360
I don't want to go on
with this conversation.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.920
You have the fucking nerve
to tell me you're mourning

15:17.000 --> 15:19.360
for your boyfriend, right?
You didn't seem to be mourning

15:19.440 --> 15:21.320
when you asked me
to push you against the wall.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.840
I didn't see the rosary
among your fingers.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.320
If you ever talk to me that way,
I'll smash your face.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.280
Change to selfie camera.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.200
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

15:40.280 --> 15:41.840
-No, no!
-Fucking hell, give me that!

15:41.920 --> 15:42.800
Hold on!

15:43.520 --> 15:44.480
It's offline.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.160
Rewind.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.480
Stop it. Double the pixels.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.240
We've got him.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.320
-They're going to kill us.
-But what are you saying?

16:17.400 --> 16:18.840
-They're going to kill us.
-Hush!

16:18.920 --> 16:22.160
And then they'll run away
using the tunnel we're making for them.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.600
-It'll be a slaughter.
-Shut up, you don't know anything.

16:27.880 --> 16:32.880
Think for a while, huh? Do you think they
are so stupid as to set us free

16:33.080 --> 16:37.400
so we can go to the police station
to identify them? Think, jeez.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.120
-We're fucked.
-Two times they've told me

16:41.200 --> 16:42.440
I'm a dead man.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.400
-Look what's under the canvas.
-Huh?

16:48.480 --> 16:50.880
Look what's under them.
I'm not staying here

16:50.960 --> 16:53.440
waiting like a guinea pig
on my knees to be killed

16:53.520 --> 16:55.720
without doing anything.
Look under the canvas,

16:55.800 --> 16:57.640
see if you find weapons at least, come on.

17:06.080 --> 17:06.960
Hello?

17:07.040 --> 17:10.960
"You call me at 6 in the morning
and leave a confusing message

17:11.040 --> 17:13.800
where you talk about being a figurehead,

17:13.880 --> 17:18.080
thugs and empty words.
Well, I'm not bearing that in mind."

17:18.360 --> 17:21.840
You resign and leave a robbery
with 67 hostages inside.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.800
"I'm phoning you

17:24.880 --> 17:27.400
so you can fucking tell me
that you won't be in charge of the case."

17:28.760 --> 17:30.040
I will be in charge of it.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.920
Raquel, there are things
which are above you.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.080
"National Security,
the Foreign Office, the CNI..."

17:38.440 --> 17:43.000
But, remember well,
you're the only person I know

17:43.720 --> 17:45.720
"who can solve this without violence."

17:48.520 --> 17:49.880
Thanks, superintendent.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.800
And now go back to that tent
and take the lead.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.080
We have the face of one of the robbers.

17:57.640 --> 18:00.400
-I'll cover you, come on.
-No way, no way.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.640
Put your gut into it.
What's the matter, captain?

18:02.720 --> 18:04.480
-No way, no way.
-Weren't you the captain

18:04.560 --> 18:06.160
-of the rugby team?
-Athletics.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.240
Hurry then.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.360
There are containers.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.600
-It's petrol.
-Jesus!

18:29.720 --> 18:32.520
-And ammunition.
-Holy shit!

18:36.480 --> 18:37.440
What's that?

18:40.240 --> 18:41.520
Are they drugs?

18:42.400 --> 18:44.560
This is heroin. It's heroin, man.

18:45.240 --> 18:49.000
Jeez, leave that right now,
it's the fucking plastic explosive.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.240
Leave it, come to dig, come to dig.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.840
Can anybody tell me why that machine

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
-isn't working?
-We're resting.

19:01.080 --> 19:04.400
You'll rest when I tell you.
Or when it's your turn.

19:04.760 --> 19:07.640
Okay, we'll go back to it right now.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.040
Inspector, please.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.840
Inspector, is there a conflict
between Intelligence and the Police?

19:36.920 --> 19:39.880
Were the negotiations cancelled
because of your family situation

19:39.960 --> 19:42.120
-after your complaint for ill-treatment?
-What?

19:42.200 --> 19:43.400
That's all, okay?

19:44.560 --> 19:46.800
-How does that scum know that?
-I don't know.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.000
You're already back?

20:02.080 --> 20:04.120
-Have you got a minute?
-Sure.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.600
Colonel Prieto.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.160
Look, I've been a bit nervous
these last hours,

20:15.240 --> 20:18.480
but I'd like our relationship
to be a little smoother.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.600
I think both of us
can contribute a lot in this crisis.

20:22.360 --> 20:26.080
I appreciate your "mea culpa."
So here I am,

20:26.160 --> 20:29.360
completely at your disposal.
But I want you to know,

20:29.760 --> 20:31.920
before there are any misunderstandings,

20:33.040 --> 20:34.600
that I'm a married man.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.880
Raquel, Raquel.

20:39.680 --> 20:43.000
A male, not older than 25, we recorded him
with Alison Parker's mobile phone.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.160
Identity?

20:44.520 --> 20:47.800
We're on it, facial recognition
are checking the PERPOL.

20:48.040 --> 20:51.360
-I want to see the whole video.
-Play the image.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.800
We couldn't record more than six seconds.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.120
Stop it there.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.840
It looks like a Makarov.

21:02.240 --> 21:05.360
No, it's a Strizh 9mm, it's also Russian.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.640
It's rare to see them here.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.320
Tell the judicial police to question

21:10.400 --> 21:13.400
all the informers from the East
in control of the black market.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.800
-What's that on the wall?
-Telephones.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.640
Play the images of the back camera.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.960
What do the labels say? Enlarge.

21:27.040 --> 21:27.920
The hostage list?

21:33.240 --> 21:34.360
They're their phones.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.680
Recognition can have his identity

21:36.840 --> 21:39.760
-in an hour or two.
-No, we're not waiting so long.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.120
Such a special connection.
Don't you find it striking?

22:36.480 --> 22:39.360
"I was just about to call you,
at this very moment."

22:40.360 --> 22:43.320
Well, considering I'm the negotiator
and you the robber...

22:43.480 --> 22:47.080
But we shouldn't allow this crime
interfere with our relationship.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.200
Don't know about you,
but I see this as a chance.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.680
-"A chance for what?"
-To get to know each other.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.640
"I assure you that if we had met in a bar,

22:54.720 --> 22:56.880
you wouldn't have paid
any attention to me.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.400
Tell me, inspector."

23:01.560 --> 23:03.360
Have you ever faked an orgasm?

23:08.160 --> 23:09.040
No.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.800
Please, inspector,
I beg you, don't lie to me.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.440
Think about it, please.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.000
Maybe yes, maybe I've done it.

23:20.760 --> 23:25.480
Look, men are programmed to ejaculate
within the shortest time.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.600
"Women, to last
the longest time possible."

23:28.760 --> 23:32.560
And that small feature of nature
sometimes is solved with a fake orgasm.

23:32.760 --> 23:36.440
And that's nothing but a small swindle.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.200
A lie.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.200
"Such as last evening's intervention,
with three elite corps.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.960
Inspector, I'm begging you
not to lie to me,

23:46.040 --> 23:47.920
you'll put at risk innocent people."

23:48.040 --> 23:51.840
I won't. And now tell me,
why did you want to call me?

23:51.920 --> 23:55.120
Look, we need food and some medication:

23:55.800 --> 23:59.960
insulin, sertraline, albuterol,
an abortion pill

24:00.040 --> 24:02.280
-"and anxiolytics."
-An abortion pill?

24:03.120 --> 24:04.840
Requests from the hostages.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.680
We all have personal problems,
don't you think?

24:09.880 --> 24:11.840
-You'll get those requests.
-"Fine.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.240
Civil Protection will make the delivery,

24:14.320 --> 24:16.960
in transparent bags
to avoid hidden weapons.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.120
And now tell me,

24:19.720 --> 24:22.680
-you phoned me to..."
-So you surrender immediately.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.120
I've got images from the inside,

24:26.880 --> 24:28.560
"I've got the identity of one of your men.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.120
If I keep on pulling the thread,

24:30.200 --> 24:32.600
I'll know the identity
of the rest of the gang."

24:33.160 --> 24:34.160
Inspector, I think...

24:34.240 --> 24:36.920
"I'm offering you a deal
with the public prosecutor."

24:37.560 --> 24:40.600
I can lower your sentences
from 16 to 8 years,

24:40.880 --> 24:42.280
if you get out of there right now.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.920
"Nobody has died
and that gives me a little margin."

24:45.000 --> 24:47.200
I don't think it's a fair deal,
we lose out.

24:47.280 --> 24:48.320
"You've already lost."

24:48.840 --> 24:52.080
Look, in the unlikely event
you get out of there,

24:52.800 --> 24:54.400
your faces will be in the news,

24:54.560 --> 24:56.080
"police stations and borders.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.240
You're left without a plan B."

24:58.560 --> 25:01.560
-"Then we'll activate plan C."
-You think I'm bluffing, right?

25:01.880 --> 25:02.960
Frankly, yes.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.800
I'll tell you something
so you see I'm not lying:

25:06.080 --> 25:09.520
"you've got 67 mobile phones
attached with velcro on the wall."

25:12.240 --> 25:14.840
I give you one hour to accept my offer.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.040
"Listen, inspec...."

25:26.360 --> 25:29.320
We must call the police
and guide them through the assault.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.320
There's a phone in my office,
in a coat that's hanging

25:32.400 --> 25:33.960
-"from a hanger.
-No way."

25:34.120 --> 25:36.600
-Listen, you've had 40 seconds...
-You go!

25:36.680 --> 25:37.840
I can't, I can't.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.960
You know what'd happen
if there's somebody there?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.360
-They'd shoot me.
-Just like...

25:42.440 --> 25:44.920
I want to hear
that machine working, jeez!

25:45.440 --> 25:49.520
-I don't want to say that again!
-Sorry, sorry, we're sorry.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.160
-He's very tired. Sorry.
-I can't go on.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.240
-Sorry.
-I can't go on.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.800
-I'm going to die, I can't go on.
-Come on, get out of there.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.880
Get out and rest.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.320
"Hello, Professor?"

26:08.360 --> 26:10.840
They have an image
of all the phones on the wall.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.720
There are no security cameras
there, right?

26:14.800 --> 26:17.760
"No, of course not, only the one we set."

26:18.200 --> 26:20.240
So it was one of the hostages.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.040
You missed a phone, so find it

26:24.120 --> 26:26.760
-or we're screwed.
-"Give me permission to punish him.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.800
Either we block them with panic
or they'll keep on playing the heroes."

26:30.800 --> 26:33.000
-What punishment?
-"An exemplary punishment.

26:34.320 --> 26:37.080
-His execution, for example?"
-No.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.640
Find that phone.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.760
Are you really going to abort?

27:06.800 --> 27:08.920
Sorry about what I said yesterday, Mónica.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.000
It was out of place, I was an arsehole.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.840
I've never been a very brave guy,
you know?

27:17.880 --> 27:20.680
I've spent all my fucking life
doing what the others wanted from me,

27:22.800 --> 27:24.360
never what I wanted to do.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.880
And I needed to be
in a situation such as this, jeez,

27:31.440 --> 27:33.480
with guns and bullets,

27:34.480 --> 27:36.320
to realise what I really want.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.760
And I'm going to think about me.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.360
Me and you.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.360
And that baby you have inside.

27:47.760 --> 27:48.880
I love you, Mónica.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.080
I love you so much, that I know.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.480
You're the best
that's ever happened to me.

27:58.960 --> 28:03.160
I want you to continue with the pregnancy
and I want you to let me be his father.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.040
We're going to have a baby.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.800
And I want to form a family with you
if we get out of here.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.680
What do you mean, if we get out?

28:21.040 --> 28:22.960
-They're digging a tunnel.
-What?

28:23.120 --> 28:27.920
Yes, they have a lot of plastic explosive
and petrol containers.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.120
-Stand up!
-It'll be a slaughter.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.520
There's one way: contact the police
and guide them in the assault.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.320
I've got a phone in my office,
in the coat.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.880
I don't know how to get there.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.720
-I'll go.
-No, no, no.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.800
There's always a hero...

28:53.240 --> 28:55.400
who thinks he can save the others.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.760
Who thinks...

29:01.680 --> 29:04.240
nobody will notice that he's plotting

29:04.320 --> 29:07.800
a strategy to contact the police.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.000
Bravo.

29:13.280 --> 29:16.560
Congratulations,
because one of you made it,

29:17.800 --> 29:20.280
recorded an image from the inside

29:21.080 --> 29:22.720
and sent it to the police.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.400
"Aníbal Cortés, born in Getafe."

29:25.760 --> 29:28.040
He's an alarm expert, worked for two years

29:28.200 --> 29:30.960
in security companies,
he's associated with the robbery

29:31.040 --> 29:32.040
of a mansion in Geneva.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.320
He's got a warrant issued by the Interpol.

29:34.800 --> 29:39.720
So I'd like to give him
the chance to step forward

29:39.880 --> 29:42.400
so you can all thank him.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.920
And also give me that phone.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.480
He must have visited the Casa de la Moneda
to study the alarm systems.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.400
Check the hard drives
of the security company.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.640
With a bit of luck, maybe he went there
with some other gang members.

29:56.800 --> 29:57.680
Helsinki.

29:58.520 --> 29:59.560
Undress him.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.200
-Come on.
-Are you sick or what?

30:03.120 --> 30:04.160
Pay attention.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.080
Come on, take off your shirt.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.680
-Come on.
-It was one of you.

30:16.520 --> 30:19.080
I don't know who it was.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.440
Denver, undress her.

30:35.440 --> 30:38.200
You recorded a video

30:40.000 --> 30:41.800
in the phone room, right?

30:50.240 --> 30:52.240
-What's up?
-I can't breathe.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.080
Let me go with the girls.
Let me go with the girls!

30:56.240 --> 30:57.880
Berlin, I'm taking her away.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.200
-Berlin, Berlin.
-What's the matter now?

31:06.400 --> 31:07.600
I know what happened.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.520
I got distracted for a while
and I saw Alison trying

31:11.600 --> 31:14.200
to erase the fucking photo, that's all.
A mistake, that's all.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.480
What's up,
have you got an attention deficit?

31:16.560 --> 31:18.880
Because if you're
one of those children with problems,

31:18.960 --> 31:20.880
I should be the first to know.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.440
I haven't got any problems.

31:25.680 --> 31:29.640
Tokyo came in, all right?
And we argued, that's it.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.080
-It won't happen again.
-Now I see.

31:33.600 --> 31:38.080
One more time, it all comes down
to a sentimental reason.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.640
You don't know
how much you remind me of myself.

31:44.720 --> 31:49.800
I was 18, she was 44,
she was my French teacher,

31:49.880 --> 31:52.160
-I was outstanding.
-I don't know what this is about,

31:52.240 --> 31:55.000
-Tokyo isn't 44.
-She's 15 years older than you.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.960
And when you're young
and you're with a woman

31:59.040 --> 32:01.880
who's halfway through,
everything seems even better.

32:02.440 --> 32:05.200
They've got the experience
teenage girls don't have

32:05.280 --> 32:08.800
and they're even more grateful
than the ugly ones.

32:11.920 --> 32:15.080
My teacher gave me
her mature flesh every time

32:15.160 --> 32:19.080
as if it were my fucking birthday.
You know why?

32:22.160 --> 32:24.600
Because with you
they savour the lost youth,

32:24.960 --> 32:28.640
before tumbling down the slope of age.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.160
Of course...

32:44.800 --> 32:49.400
Of course there's a small difference
between your love story and mine.

32:50.640 --> 32:53.000
In my case, I wasn't
in a robbery with hostages,

32:53.080 --> 32:55.440
endangering my mates' lives.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.280
"An assault
to the epicentre of money,

33:12.360 --> 33:14.080
the most outstanding robbery ever.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.000
Bizarre robbery calls
international attention."

33:17.080 --> 33:18.680
What do you think? Do you want a coffee?

33:18.760 --> 33:20.560
Jesus, we have an officer in the ICU,

33:20.640 --> 33:23.760
67 hostages,
a lot of guys armed to the teeth

33:23.840 --> 33:26.520
and for the reporters
this is something colourful.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.800
I don't care about the headlines,
what worries me

33:28.880 --> 33:31.560
is that they have too much information
and that doesn't help us.

33:31.640 --> 33:32.560
Are you okay?

33:34.120 --> 33:37.240
I'm going out for lunch.
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.840
All right.
Listen, the inspector is coming out.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.960
"Move the paparazzi away."

34:09.120 --> 34:12.440
Leave the boxes on the ground
and go back really slowly.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.600
"I've got a phone
in my office, in the coat."

34:53.240 --> 34:54.400
It's very hot here.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.000
The medicine.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.520
I'm going...

35:32.120 --> 35:33.040
Hey!

35:34.200 --> 35:35.080
May I?

35:41.840 --> 35:42.880
Sit down.

35:44.680 --> 35:45.920
Sit down!

35:58.560 --> 36:00.240
The medicine is here.

36:03.640 --> 36:04.880
Hand them out.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.800
-I'm going to sit down.
-Wait.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.480
Come outside.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.520
Come outside.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.600
You may think
what I'm telling you is bullshit.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.920
I don't think
abortion is a very good idea.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.600
Thanks.

37:13.520 --> 37:17.520
"The kidnappers have been locked up
in the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda...."

37:17.600 --> 37:19.240
They're not leaving that place, right?

37:21.160 --> 37:22.040
Those people, I mean.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.760
You must be desperate
to do something like that, right?

37:25.200 --> 37:27.320
That's what makes them so dangerous.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.840
No, but they don't want to hurt anybody.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.800
Well, that's what they said.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.400
So they wouldn't be armed,
don't you think?

37:37.360 --> 37:38.960
Sure, I guess you're right.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.080
But you don't try to rob

37:42.160 --> 37:44.800
the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre
with a slingshot, right?

37:45.280 --> 37:47.560
"The assailants were surprised by a patrol

37:47.640 --> 37:49.760
while they were trying
to escape with bags of money

37:49.840 --> 37:52.680
and they shot
the two officers who tried to...."

37:53.000 --> 37:54.120
The bill, please.

37:57.960 --> 38:01.040
And...? Do you know how many they are?

38:01.120 --> 38:03.480
Because in some places
they say they're seven.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.480
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.320
Hello?

38:13.800 --> 38:15.880
"Raquel, the boy was at the museum."

38:16.560 --> 38:17.600
How long ago?

38:18.280 --> 38:22.080
"Three months ago, the cameras got him
as part of a guided tour."

38:22.440 --> 38:23.680
Was he alone?

38:23.760 --> 38:27.840
"No, you were right, he was with someone.
Listen, we have the identity

38:27.920 --> 38:30.760
of another robber,
they sent you his picture

38:30.840 --> 38:33.480
from judiciary police,
you should receive it right now."

38:44.680 --> 38:45.600
Ah!

38:46.360 --> 38:47.240
Ah!

38:48.240 --> 38:50.840
-Where have you got it?
-What are you talking about?

38:51.680 --> 38:54.240
-Where is the recorder?
-But what...?

38:54.320 --> 38:56.480
It's a coincidence you're here every day

38:56.560 --> 38:58.360
-asking me questions.
-I don't know...

38:58.440 --> 38:59.720
-Who do you work for?
-Pardon?

38:59.880 --> 39:02.120
-Who the fuck do you work for?
-I'm not a journalist,

39:02.200 --> 39:04.680
my name's Salvador Martín,
look my wallet. Antonio, please.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.680
-What's the matter, Salva?
-I don't know...

39:06.840 --> 39:08.520
I know him, he comes here every day.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.400
You need dough for the baby, right?

39:39.560 --> 39:40.760
-Yes.
-No, no...

39:40.840 --> 39:45.920
Yes. Listen, this is a robbery,
you may get something for you.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.640
No, not really.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.720
Hide this in your underwear now.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.920
20,000 bucks, you can buy nappies for him

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
-until he leaves university.
-It's not that.

39:59.520 --> 40:02.280
It's really not that.
I appreciate it, but...

40:02.360 --> 40:04.200
Give me the pill
and I'm going back inside.

40:08.920 --> 40:09.800
Fine.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.920
So what's up?

40:19.400 --> 40:21.360
-He'll screw up your life.
-Pardon?

40:21.640 --> 40:24.520
Your son.
It's better he screws up your life

40:24.920 --> 40:26.840
rather than any
of these motherfuckers, or me.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.760
-Are you going to screw up my life?
-Life gets screwed up very easily.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.640
One day you're working smoothly,

40:32.240 --> 40:34.480
four lunatics with Dalí masks come in,

40:35.560 --> 40:38.320
one of them goes crazy, he shoots his gun
and everything goes wrong.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.080
This screws up your life.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.040
Not a baby.

40:47.160 --> 40:50.000
What do you know about what screws me
up? What do you know?

40:52.640 --> 40:54.000
My mother wanted to abort me.

40:55.440 --> 40:56.400
But first...

40:56.920 --> 40:59.000
she felt the need to snort
some of the blow my dad had to sell

40:59.080 --> 41:00.600
so they could pay for the abortion.

41:01.200 --> 41:04.920
And the municipal police
arrested her in a shitty portico.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.840
I was born among the jail,
the drugs and the police.

41:09.840 --> 41:10.920
And what do you know?

41:14.560 --> 41:17.640
Because it seems your job
is not one adventure after another,

41:17.720 --> 41:19.560
and when you go out
it isn't a party, either.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.160
-Or do you do "kilates"?
-Pilates...

41:21.320 --> 41:23.200
So I was right.
And you go for a drink on Friday.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.760
Fucking shit, girl,
another plan screwed up due to the baby.

41:25.840 --> 41:28.200
Who do you go out with?
Where are your friends?

41:28.280 --> 41:31.440
I'll tell you. At home, with their babies.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.400
Do they look screwed up? No, right?

41:35.360 --> 41:38.200
What crazy thing do you do
that you can't do with a baby?

41:41.320 --> 41:43.800
If his father is an arsehole
and he misses it, that's better,

41:43.880 --> 41:46.400
all his affection for you.
Do you know how much he can love you?

41:47.880 --> 41:49.600
What are you doing, Denver?

41:51.600 --> 41:53.360
I'm giving her the pill to abort.

41:57.480 --> 41:58.560
What's up?

41:59.360 --> 42:02.200
Does she need you to put it in her mouth
with a little water?

42:02.360 --> 42:03.960
Abortion is a private thing, right?

42:05.320 --> 42:08.240
Women decide,
but not in front of everybody.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.040
Anyway, I'm...

42:12.320 --> 42:14.560
I'll think about it
until we get out of here.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.720
Wonderful.

42:27.760 --> 42:31.160
I'm glad you want to continue
with the pregnancy. Really.

42:33.320 --> 42:36.200
Now go back to the office with the others.

43:37.640 --> 43:39.600
Did you just come from a stag party?

43:41.040 --> 43:42.120
Or were you going there?

43:47.880 --> 43:50.160
"That wasn't the first time
Berlin put his hand

43:50.240 --> 43:51.920
in the knickers of an honest woman,

43:53.000 --> 43:55.840
but it'd be the first time
he'd take it out so soon.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.960
Maybe Mónica would have preferred
him to let himself go,

43:59.040 --> 44:01.120
follow his instinct
and forget about the phone

44:01.200 --> 44:04.520
that had rung between her legs,
but it wasn't so ."

44:08.600 --> 44:09.560
Denver.

44:12.240 --> 44:15.880
What will happen with our authority
when I tell the others?

44:17.400 --> 44:21.800
"Even Berlin could
distinguish pleasure from duty."

44:23.040 --> 44:24.160
Kill her.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.160
You heard me.

45:01.440 --> 45:02.440
Let's see.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.680
"For the first time I realised
there was something

45:40.760 --> 45:42.800
that had always been wrong
in all my love affairs.

45:44.320 --> 45:45.880
They had always taken care of me.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.800
But this time it'd be different."

46:02.400 --> 46:05.880
What's up? Jesus, Tokyo, Tokyo. Tokyo!

46:06.440 --> 46:08.160
Jesus, go and find Berlin.

46:44.840 --> 46:47.920
"Listen to me. If anybody
touches him again,"

46:48.080 --> 46:49.640
I swear to God that the next shot

46:49.720 --> 46:53.000
will be against Helsinki,
Berlin or against you.

46:55.400 --> 46:58.880
You're out there, free,
while we're risking

46:58.960 --> 47:00.800
"our fucking lives in this mouse trap."

47:00.960 --> 47:02.000
What?

47:08.320 --> 47:09.680
"Helsinki, put the gun down."

47:09.760 --> 47:11.800
What are you doing?

47:13.000 --> 47:13.880
Helsinki.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.720
Helsinki.

47:22.120 --> 47:23.200
Put the gun down.

47:30.080 --> 47:32.000
Don't do it, please.

47:32.080 --> 47:33.920
Why did you have to get
that fucking phone?

47:34.000 --> 47:34.880
Sorry.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.760
Why the hell did you have to trick me?

47:37.280 --> 47:38.440
Tokyo...

47:39.640 --> 47:40.800
Rio, don't!

47:42.160 --> 47:45.840
Where do you think you're going?
You did more than enough today.

47:46.440 --> 47:47.320
Helsinki.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.720
Do you know what will happen
if I don't kill you?

48:02.480 --> 48:04.280
-They'll kill me.
-No...

48:05.200 --> 48:06.920
And then they'll kill you.

48:07.600 --> 48:08.600
So now what?

48:12.120 --> 48:15.160
"I wasn't even listening to my shouts,
I only wanted to write

48:15.240 --> 48:18.880
a fucking love letter.
While the guns and the gazes

48:18.960 --> 48:22.040
were pointing at me,
reality fell like a concrete slab

48:22.120 --> 48:25.560
and I knew the five months
during which I had believed in something

48:25.640 --> 48:26.920
were over."

48:27.160 --> 48:29.640
Your love story has fucked up
your escape plan.

48:31.280 --> 48:32.320
"They've got you."

48:33.960 --> 48:36.080
"And Rio too,
the police know who you are."

48:43.680 --> 48:45.440
"You're in every news programme."

49:04.800 --> 49:06.240
For fuck's sake.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.000
For fuck's sake, man.

49:11.480 --> 49:12.640
Come on, man.

49:15.400 --> 49:16.640
Come on, man.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.280
Ah...

49:19.600 --> 49:20.520
Ah...

49:21.920 --> 49:22.800
On your knees.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.400
No.

49:26.880 --> 49:28.360
Don't look at me.

49:30.840 --> 49:31.920
Don't look at me.

49:32.080 --> 49:34.000
-Please.
-Don't fucking look at me.

49:34.080 --> 49:35.960
Don't fucking look at me.
