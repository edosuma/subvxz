00:02.780 --> 00:05.848
Ariel, I am very impressed.
This is gorgeous.

00:05.850 --> 00:07.650
Oh.

00:09.493 --> 00:11.086
That was totally meant for Theo.

00:11.088 --> 00:12.638
I'm so sorry, Ms. Howland.

00:12.640 --> 00:13.864
Thank you, Kelsey.

00:13.889 --> 00:14.888
Luke,

00:14.913 --> 00:17.196
lucky for you, I'm wearing this.

00:17.216 --> 00:18.902
- So I'm not in trouble?
- Of course you are.

00:18.904 --> 00:20.851
But not nearly as much as
if we were using oil paints.

00:22.855 --> 00:25.255
All right, see you soon.

00:25.257 --> 00:28.066
I'm amazed how well you handled Luke.

00:28.091 --> 00:29.523
Nothing can get to me today.

00:29.525 --> 00:31.014
My stocks are way up.

00:31.054 --> 00:32.086
It's like I hit the lottery.

00:32.088 --> 00:33.321
My broker told me to hold

00:33.323 --> 00:34.856
another week or so, but I'm not greedy.

00:34.858 --> 00:37.559
All I need is enough for
the down payment on this condo.

00:37.561 --> 00:39.894
No more 90-minute commutes to school.

00:40.897 --> 00:41.963
Hang on.

00:41.965 --> 00:44.074
This has to be a mistake.

00:44.768 --> 00:46.412
It's gone.

00:47.637 --> 00:49.037
My money's gone.

00:49.039 --> 00:52.874
$87.26... that's all that's left.

00:52.876 --> 00:55.977
This is all of my savings.

00:57.113 --> 00:58.146
Hey!

00:58.148 --> 00:59.589
Where you think you're going?

00:59.591 --> 01:01.649
I have to talk to my stockbroker!

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.429 --> 01:14.833
I'm calling about your
account at Brannigan Trust.

01:14.835 --> 01:16.231
Great news, you qualify

01:16.233 --> 01:18.694
for our free investment
advisory services.

01:18.754 --> 01:19.819
Yeah, great.

01:19.821 --> 01:20.969
I've reviewed your account

01:20.971 --> 01:22.937
and have a couple of strong
performers to recommend.

01:22.939 --> 01:25.340
Sure, no pressure. Talk to your husband

01:25.342 --> 01:27.121
when he gets home from work.

01:27.123 --> 01:29.244
The stock won't be
at this price tomorrow.

01:29.246 --> 01:30.812
No, no, look, if you're asking me,

01:30.814 --> 01:33.281
you don't want to sell yet.
But that is between us, okay?

01:33.283 --> 01:34.616
And, nope, don't ask me

01:34.618 --> 01:36.784
how I know, just make sure
to send me a postcard

01:36.786 --> 01:38.386
after you've cashed in
and you're docking

01:38.388 --> 01:39.654
your yacht in the Bahamas.

01:39.656 --> 01:40.855
Excuse me.

01:40.857 --> 01:42.457
Hello?

01:42.459 --> 01:44.125
Uh, which one of you is Alex DuBois?

01:44.127 --> 01:45.360
Oh.

01:46.930 --> 01:48.730
No way.

01:49.633 --> 01:51.499
This is unbelievable.

01:51.501 --> 01:53.368
This is a stock scam.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.940
A woman is here.

01:58.942 --> 02:00.742
She's looking for some advice.

02:00.744 --> 02:02.210
Sounds like she got scammed
in one of those

02:02.212 --> 02:03.444
bogus investment deals.

02:03.446 --> 02:04.512
How much did she lose?

02:04.514 --> 02:05.914
$19,000.

02:05.916 --> 02:07.682
That's not really
what we do here, Chunk.

02:07.684 --> 02:09.517
I know, but it looks like it pretty much

02:09.519 --> 02:11.853
wiped out her savings.
Can we help her out?

02:11.855 --> 02:14.254
Well, you could have Benny
take a look at it.

02:14.256 --> 02:16.024
Maybe there's a small claims case.

02:16.026 --> 02:17.525
- Okay.
- Where is Benny?

02:17.527 --> 02:18.560
Late again.

02:18.562 --> 02:20.228
Oh, he's running some errands.

02:21.197 --> 02:22.463
Hmm.

02:22.465 --> 02:25.366
Look, um, her name is Erin Howland.

02:25.368 --> 02:27.068
She went to the U.S. Attorney's Office,

02:27.070 --> 02:29.170
and they turned her down.

02:29.172 --> 02:30.972
We can one-up the feds, right?

02:32.728 --> 02:34.058
Who is she?

02:34.060 --> 02:35.243
Friend of a friend.

02:36.428 --> 02:37.478
If it's that fashion editor

02:37.480 --> 02:40.656
you introduced me to last
month, the answer is no.

02:40.658 --> 02:42.817
No. She's not.

02:43.078 --> 02:44.319
Supermodel?

02:45.640 --> 02:48.189
She's my nephew's fifth grade teacher.

02:51.094 --> 02:52.493
I can't believe this happened to me.

02:52.495 --> 02:54.199
It's humiliating. It's okay.

02:54.201 --> 02:55.532
You can trust Bull.

02:55.534 --> 02:57.480
Just tell him what you told me.

02:58.168 --> 03:00.835
About six months ago,
an investment advisor called me.

03:00.837 --> 03:02.136
He told me about some stocks.

03:02.138 --> 03:04.038
- A sure thing.
- I know what you're thinking,

03:04.040 --> 03:05.740
but I'm not one of those
people. Ask anyone.

03:05.742 --> 03:07.742
Nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.

03:07.744 --> 03:10.078
Well, telemarketers can be persuasive.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.580
They once got me for a 400-buck pen.

03:12.582 --> 03:15.183
It's a valuable lesson
for a ten-year-old, though.

03:15.185 --> 03:16.918
I wasn't looking for a
get-rich-quick scheme.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.853
I thought I was investing responsibly.

03:18.855 --> 03:20.922
As soon as I bought the
stock, the price shot up.

03:20.924 --> 03:22.957
- I was making a huge profit.
- Mm.

03:22.959 --> 03:24.525
On paper. I wanted to sell,

03:24.527 --> 03:28.129
but he told me to hold
on for a few more weeks.

03:28.131 --> 03:31.699
Well, the price crashed, along
with almost my entire savings.

03:31.701 --> 03:32.934
$19,000.

03:33.970 --> 03:36.337
You want us to track this guy down?

03:36.339 --> 03:38.740
I did that already, which is how
I found out it's a scam.

03:38.742 --> 03:40.975
Hmm. Well, you're clearly proactive.

03:40.977 --> 03:42.948
Not a pushover.

03:42.950 --> 03:44.579
So, I'm curious, why would you trust

03:44.581 --> 03:47.281
a stranger with
your entire life savings?

03:47.283 --> 03:49.250
He wasn't a stranger.

03:49.252 --> 03:51.986
He worked at my bank, Brannigan Trust.

03:51.988 --> 03:53.788
<i>The</i> Brannigan Trust?

03:54.256 --> 03:55.755
Yeah.

04:01.364 --> 04:02.797
Well, they cleared out fast.

04:02.799 --> 04:05.299
Looks more like a boiler room
than a bank.

04:05.301 --> 04:07.835
Brannigan Trust has been
around since J.P. Morgan.

04:07.837 --> 04:09.604
Why would they get involved
in a boiler room?

04:09.606 --> 04:11.005
I'm telling you, it was them.

04:11.007 --> 04:13.090
That's where the sign was; it said:

04:13.092 --> 04:15.043
- Alternative Investment Division.
- And this is where

04:15.045 --> 04:17.411
- you were last week?
- As soon as I left, I called the FBI,

04:17.414 --> 04:19.313
the SEC, the U.S. Attorney,

04:19.315 --> 04:20.748
the Better Business Bureau,
the Attorney General,

04:20.750 --> 04:21.849
and Brannigan Trust.

04:21.851 --> 04:23.818
Well, that explains
why they left so fast.

04:23.820 --> 04:25.586
And they all gave me
the runaround. Do you think

04:25.588 --> 04:26.754
there's any chance I get my money back?

04:26.756 --> 04:29.223
First, we have to find out who stole it.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.592
Where did you get that?

04:31.594 --> 04:33.227
Belongs to the notary next door.

04:33.229 --> 04:34.662
We should hurry before

04:34.664 --> 04:35.863
she notices it's gone.

04:35.865 --> 04:37.965
Check your caller I.D.

04:40.670 --> 04:42.370
Brannigan Trust.

04:42.372 --> 04:43.671
See, I told you.

04:43.673 --> 04:45.473
I know somebody who works there.

04:45.475 --> 04:47.108
I'm gonna pay him a little visit.

04:48.278 --> 04:49.210
Oh, are you the notary

04:49.212 --> 04:50.178
from next door?

04:50.180 --> 04:51.379
I was trying to call you.

04:51.381 --> 04:53.014
I-I think I found your phone.

05:04.427 --> 05:05.893
You hungry?

05:05.895 --> 05:08.262
No, I try to stay away from that stuff.

05:08.264 --> 05:10.998
You know, a pastrami sandwich
can usually make things better.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.333
But not today.

05:12.335 --> 05:14.602
Does this have anything to do
with that old case of yours?

05:14.604 --> 05:16.726
Hayden Watkins, yes.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.708
Last night, the appeals court
overturned the verdict.

05:20.710 --> 05:22.844
Apparently, there's new DNA evidence.

05:22.846 --> 05:24.245
The DNA evidence cleared him?

05:24.247 --> 05:26.881
He did nine years for a crime
he didn't commit.

05:27.287 --> 05:28.783
And?

05:29.175 --> 05:32.895
I'm under investigation
by the U.S. Attorney.

05:33.503 --> 05:35.423
Prosecutorial misconduct.

05:35.425 --> 05:37.024
What did you do?

05:38.455 --> 05:39.761
Nothing.

05:39.763 --> 05:42.997
Any time a murder conviction
is reversed, it's reviewed.

05:43.573 --> 05:45.066
First person under a microscope

05:45.068 --> 05:46.534
is the prosecutor.

05:46.536 --> 05:47.969
When are you gonna tell Bull?

05:58.622 --> 06:00.148
Thanks for seeing me, Griffin.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.302
I've been meaning to call.
Are you gonna serve

06:02.304 --> 06:04.051
on the flight museum board
with me again?

06:04.053 --> 06:06.241
Well, if you insist.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.589
So, what was so urgent?

06:08.591 --> 06:11.125
Well, I have this client
who lost 19 grand

06:11.127 --> 06:13.261
in one of your brokerage divisions.

06:13.263 --> 06:14.695
Whose daughter is it?

06:14.697 --> 06:16.931
What trust fund
did she just get access to?

06:16.933 --> 06:19.967
No trust-afarian. She's a schoolteacher.

06:19.969 --> 06:21.669
And it seems she was duped

06:21.671 --> 06:24.839
by an overly aggressive broker
named Alex DuBois.

06:24.841 --> 06:26.374
Well, I've got somewhere
in the neighborhood

06:26.376 --> 06:28.776
of 275,000 employees.

06:28.778 --> 06:31.045
I know you do, but it turns
out that every broker

06:31.047 --> 06:32.513
in this Alternative Investment Division

06:32.515 --> 06:34.182
were operating under that name.

06:34.184 --> 06:35.750
Well, I'll have someone look into it.

06:35.752 --> 06:37.552
She said she got a call from this bank,

06:37.554 --> 06:40.188
offering her the deal of a lifetime.

06:40.190 --> 06:42.023
I've been banking here for 25 years.

06:42.025 --> 06:44.058
I'm just wondering
why no one ever called

06:44.060 --> 06:45.626
and made me that offer.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.466
My client wants her money back.

06:51.468 --> 06:53.401
It's 19 grand, Griffin.

06:53.403 --> 06:54.844
Jason,

06:54.846 --> 06:58.072
they're called "alternative"
investments for a reason.

06:58.074 --> 07:00.141
We can't return money
to everyone who complains

07:00.143 --> 07:02.176
about losing in the market.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.412
There are others?

07:07.183 --> 07:08.751
Griffin.

07:12.188 --> 07:15.556
Cable, do a phone dump
on the outgoing calls

07:15.558 --> 07:17.391
from those empty bank offices.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.493
- Would you?
- What are we looking for?

07:19.495 --> 07:21.529
More victims.

07:22.866 --> 07:24.899
I never invested in the market before.

07:24.901 --> 07:26.767
Figured I'd give it a try.

07:26.769 --> 07:30.304
They conned me out of 12 grand
and lined their pockets.

07:30.306 --> 07:32.340
My own bank took me for a ride.

07:32.342 --> 07:34.842
I worked for the transit
authority for 40 years,

07:34.844 --> 07:37.678
kept all my savings in Brannigan Trust.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.982
72,000 bucks...
just like that, it's gone.

07:40.984 --> 07:43.651
Totally. They told me I was
investing in high-tech drones.

07:43.653 --> 07:45.186
It sounded really cool.

07:45.188 --> 07:48.789
Turns out, the company only has
one customer and really bad R&D.

07:48.791 --> 07:49.857
Yeah, well, you know,

07:49.859 --> 07:52.493
they hustled me out of 37,000 bucks.

07:52.495 --> 07:54.228
I was planning on buying a Sea Ray,

07:54.230 --> 07:56.297
doing some fishing,
you know, on the weekends.

07:56.299 --> 07:57.298
I could kill...

08:00.103 --> 08:01.369
Starts with "A" through "C."

08:01.371 --> 08:02.603
There you go.

08:03.539 --> 08:04.472
Okay.

08:04.474 --> 08:05.673
Chunk.

08:05.675 --> 08:06.774
Hey.

08:06.776 --> 08:07.775
I'm Benny Colón,

08:07.777 --> 08:08.843
TAC's in-house counsel.

08:08.845 --> 08:10.111
Erin Howland.

08:10.113 --> 08:12.914
Oh, so you're the one
responsible for all this.

08:12.916 --> 08:15.016
And Chunk. I-I had no idea

08:15.018 --> 08:17.218
there would be this many people
scammed by the bank.

08:17.220 --> 08:18.653
Got more than we expected.

08:18.655 --> 08:20.087
Are you gonna be handling the trial?

08:20.089 --> 08:21.455
I will, so if you have

08:21.457 --> 08:23.758
any questions at all,
don't hesitate to ask.

08:30.934 --> 08:32.099
Nice turnout.

08:32.101 --> 08:33.678
I have my doubts.

08:34.770 --> 08:37.071
Class actions don't fall
into your lap every day.

08:37.073 --> 08:38.405
It's a contingency case

08:38.408 --> 08:40.341
with 4,000 victims from
across the country.

08:40.342 --> 08:41.808
The costs will be astronomical.

08:41.811 --> 08:42.876
High risk, high reward.

08:42.879 --> 08:44.779
We will have to front all the expenses:

08:44.781 --> 08:48.082
travel, research, depositions,
financial analysis,

08:48.084 --> 08:49.750
trial prep, expert witness fees,

08:49.752 --> 08:51.485
not to mention the
thousands of man-hours

08:51.487 --> 08:53.287
that TAC would invest in the case.

08:53.289 --> 08:54.989
Look, Brannigan Trust is gonna fight.

08:54.991 --> 08:57.058
Hard. We could lose millions.

08:57.060 --> 08:58.192
We could win millions.

08:58.194 --> 08:59.560
Exactly, all or nothing.

08:59.562 --> 09:02.196
You'd be betting the future
of the firm on one case.

09:02.727 --> 09:05.366
You're right. It's a big gamble.

09:06.636 --> 09:09.415
Ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention, please?

09:09.417 --> 09:11.339
My name is Dr. Jason Bull.

09:11.341 --> 09:13.874
Welcome to the class action.

09:22.524 --> 09:25.172
We have to prove

09:25.174 --> 09:27.141
that it was reasonable for our victims

09:27.143 --> 09:28.876
to have relied on the brokers' advice.

09:28.878 --> 09:30.978
That advice was fraudulent

09:30.980 --> 09:32.546
because the brokers had information

09:32.548 --> 09:34.014
that they did not share.

09:34.016 --> 09:36.350
With the operative word
being "reasonable."

09:36.352 --> 09:38.185
Civil trial, federal court...

09:38.187 --> 09:39.253
there's no wiggle room.

09:39.255 --> 09:40.888
I know. Jury has to be unanimous.

09:40.890 --> 09:43.910
Hey, you know that Bull wants
to target Griffin Fuller,

09:43.912 --> 09:45.893
CEO of Brannigan Trust?

09:45.895 --> 09:48.128
He lawyered up as soon
as Bull left his office.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.596
'Cause he's got a lot on the line.

09:49.598 --> 09:51.465
Third largest bank in the world.

09:51.467 --> 09:56.003
5,700 branches, $2.3 trillion in assets,

09:56.005 --> 09:57.571
over 72 million clients.

09:57.573 --> 10:00.808
Well, 4,211 of those clients
are victims.

10:00.810 --> 10:02.209
Yeah, out $100 million.

10:02.211 --> 10:04.045
Well, with the standard contingency fee,

10:04.047 --> 10:06.259
if we win, we win a
third of the judgment.

10:06.261 --> 10:07.247
A third?

10:07.249 --> 10:08.549
Minus our expenses.

10:08.551 --> 10:10.384
Could also win millions
in punitive damages.

10:10.386 --> 10:12.386
This is exactly what
got our victims into trouble.

10:12.388 --> 10:14.088
The fantasy of a massive windfall.

10:14.090 --> 10:15.656
- Fantasy sold to them
- Well...

10:15.658 --> 10:16.857
by a bank they trusted.

10:16.859 --> 10:18.859
Okay, we are already way over budget.

10:18.861 --> 10:20.561
We can't keep digging into reserves.

10:20.563 --> 10:21.829
Fantasy of easy money.

10:21.831 --> 10:23.263
These are the stockbrokers

10:23.265 --> 10:25.032
from Brannigan's Alternative
Investment Division.

10:25.034 --> 10:27.568
Were. They all got pink-slipped
when the division was shut down.

10:27.570 --> 10:28.936
- Where are they now?
- Telemarketing,

10:28.938 --> 10:30.037
sales, brokerage firms.

10:30.039 --> 10:32.506
Wait, Sofia Dern

10:32.508 --> 10:35.909
pulled in nearly $750,000?

10:35.911 --> 10:37.144
Pump-and-dump was very good to her.

10:37.146 --> 10:38.278
Yeah, I know a little

10:38.280 --> 10:40.147
about the stock market,
but my knowledge of

10:40.149 --> 10:42.649
a pump-and-dump doesn't go
beyond that movie <i> Boiler Room.</i>

10:42.651 --> 10:45.552
So how are we gonna explain that
to a jury without the aid of

10:45.554 --> 10:47.354
a young Ben Affleck or Vin Diesel?

10:48.157 --> 10:50.090
Pump-and-dump fraud is as old

10:50.092 --> 10:52.326
as stock brokering itself.

10:52.328 --> 10:54.394
There are three steps.

10:54.396 --> 10:56.897
the buy.

10:56.899 --> 10:59.066
Stockbrokers in Brannigan Trust

10:59.068 --> 11:02.469
purchased millions of dollars
worth of stocks for themselves.

11:02.471 --> 11:05.806
Then they got their clients
to purchase the same stocks,

11:05.808 --> 11:07.474
on a massive scale.

11:07.476 --> 11:09.843
You don't want to buy a stock. No.

11:09.845 --> 11:12.112
You want to buy a life, Jake.

11:12.114 --> 11:14.114
The life you deserve.

11:14.116 --> 11:16.183
Jake, this is your chance.

11:16.185 --> 11:18.952
Buy that life.

11:18.954 --> 11:20.888
Yes!

11:20.890 --> 11:23.056
the pump.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.346
More and more people
invested in this stock.

11:25.348 --> 11:27.761
Let's call it Hagen Tool & Die.

11:27.763 --> 11:30.089
That made the price skyrocket.

11:31.105 --> 11:33.200
A $2 stock was suddenly worth $10.

11:33.202 --> 11:36.003
The clients were thrilled.
So were the brokers.

11:38.140 --> 11:40.207
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug...

11:47.650 --> 11:50.417
All right, let's hear it
for Hagen Tool & Die

11:50.419 --> 11:53.820
closing in at 15 2/10!

11:56.992 --> 11:59.726
the dump.

11:59.728 --> 12:01.295
When the stock is worth many times

12:01.297 --> 12:03.330
what the brokers paid
for their shares...

12:03.332 --> 12:04.598
Sell! Sell!

12:04.600 --> 12:07.367
Yes, all of my shares. Are you deaf?

12:07.369 --> 12:09.970
The sudden flood of supply
made the stock value tank.

12:09.972 --> 12:14.308
<i>But the brokers had already
cashed out tens of millions.</i>

12:14.310 --> 12:16.410
Yes! Oh, yes!

12:17.846 --> 12:20.747
Meanwhile, the clients...
they lost everything.

12:22.017 --> 12:23.917
The mock jury loved the presentation,

12:23.919 --> 12:25.385
but they still found for the bank.

12:25.387 --> 12:27.788
The majority still think
our clients were greedy

12:27.790 --> 12:29.890
or stupid or both.

12:29.892 --> 12:31.992
Well, they haven't heard from Erin.

12:31.994 --> 12:33.527
She'll present well.

12:33.529 --> 12:36.129
Schoolteacher, smart, not out for money.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.327
No, it's not enough.

12:38.701 --> 12:40.467
We have to change the narrative entirely

12:40.469 --> 12:43.503
because this case is all about trust.

12:43.505 --> 12:46.607
These investors trusted their bank.

12:46.609 --> 12:50.110
They'd never give their money
to some fly-by-night operation.

12:50.112 --> 12:53.180
We could target jurors who are
loyal to particular brands,

12:53.182 --> 12:54.281
people who understand

12:54.283 --> 12:56.183
why victims trusted the Brannigan name.

12:56.185 --> 12:58.986
No, brand-loyal jurors
will find for Brannigan.

12:58.988 --> 13:02.289
They want to believe in
their established institutions.

13:02.291 --> 13:03.557
We want the opposite.

13:03.559 --> 13:05.459
Disloyal jurors?

13:05.461 --> 13:07.261
People who aren't attached
to specific brands.

13:07.263 --> 13:10.564
People who know you can't
just blindly rely on a name.

13:10.566 --> 13:12.799
So people how keep their
money under the mattress.

13:12.801 --> 13:15.636
Yeah. They shop in
independent bookstores,

13:15.638 --> 13:18.775
and they eat at mom-and-pop diners.

13:20.943 --> 13:23.677
We want jurors who will accept

13:23.679 --> 13:27.047
that just because it's called
Brannigan Trust

13:27.049 --> 13:29.216
doesn't mean it can be trusted.

13:29.218 --> 13:30.704
Ah.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.590
So what's this?

13:36.592 --> 13:38.492
Your hand.

13:38.494 --> 13:40.494
It's a sign of uncertainty.
That's unlike you.

13:40.496 --> 13:43.630
It's also an indicator of an itchy neck.

13:43.632 --> 13:44.831
Hmm.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.502
I hope it doesn't get any worse.

13:48.504 --> 13:50.070
I'm sure it's just a bite.

13:50.072 --> 13:52.606
I mean this trend of tardiness lately.

13:52.608 --> 13:56.710
Sorry, I didn't even realize
we had an early meeting.

14:02.618 --> 14:04.217
That's good news.

14:04.219 --> 14:07.200
Judge Vortuba is hearing the case.

14:08.023 --> 14:09.648
That's not good news.

14:10.292 --> 14:12.913
Uh, I thought you guys were buddies.

14:13.429 --> 14:14.594
We were.

14:14.596 --> 14:15.796
All rise.

14:15.798 --> 14:18.475
The Honorable Judge
Robert Vortuba presiding.

14:18.477 --> 14:20.107
Good morning, everyone.

14:22.037 --> 14:23.837
Dr. Bull.

14:23.839 --> 14:24.905
Judge.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.539
Uh, before we get started,

14:26.541 --> 14:28.542
I want to disclose
that I keep some of my money

14:28.544 --> 14:30.210
in Brannigan Trust...
I don't think it's a conflict.

14:30.212 --> 14:32.112
But in the interest of fairness,

14:32.114 --> 14:33.213
I'll entertain argument.

14:33.215 --> 14:34.948
- We need a new judge.
- Leave it.

14:34.950 --> 14:37.184
He gave you the stink eye;
that is not a good sign.

14:37.186 --> 14:38.785
If you ask him to recuse himself,

14:38.787 --> 14:41.254
he'll turn you down, and then
he'll hold it against you

14:41.256 --> 14:43.290
- for the rest of the trial.
- What did you do to him?

14:43.292 --> 14:44.324
Long story.

14:44.326 --> 14:45.659
Any objections, Counselor?

14:45.661 --> 14:47.094
Uh, none whatsoever.

14:47.096 --> 14:48.695
We're confident of Your Honor's ability

14:48.697 --> 14:50.797
to be fair and impartial.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.189
We respectfully request
that you recuse yourself.

14:54.191 --> 14:55.502
Your request is

14:55.504 --> 14:56.937
duly noted and denied.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.939
Your Honor, for the record,

14:58.941 --> 15:02.242
I have to state that this
lawsuit is nothing more

15:02.244 --> 15:03.844
than a thinly veiled shakedown.

15:03.846 --> 15:05.879
I think that's for the jury to decide.

15:05.881 --> 15:08.315
Dr. Bull, I wasn't aware
you had a law degree.

15:08.317 --> 15:10.550
No, still just the PhDs.

15:10.552 --> 15:11.786
Oh, good.

15:11.788 --> 15:14.221
Well, we're about to start voir dire,

15:14.223 --> 15:16.890
and I'm not going to allow
anybody to manipulate my jury.

15:16.892 --> 15:18.125
Isn't that the purpose of a trial?

15:18.127 --> 15:20.503
Lawyers try to influence the jury

15:20.505 --> 15:22.162
with facts and arguments?

15:22.164 --> 15:23.630
You'll be allowed back in the courtroom

15:23.632 --> 15:24.664
after we finish voir dire.

15:24.666 --> 15:27.200
Uh, respectfully,

15:27.202 --> 15:29.336
I'd ask the court's indulgence.

15:29.338 --> 15:31.872
Dr. Bull is an integral
part of the team.

15:31.874 --> 15:33.039
I made my ruling.

15:35.007 --> 15:36.176
Hmm.

15:36.178 --> 15:37.210
Have fun.

15:38.087 --> 15:39.212
Your Honor.

15:41.417 --> 15:42.916
Counsel.

15:44.975 --> 15:46.920
Benny did a good job in voir dire,

15:46.922 --> 15:48.588
but we have some problems.

15:48.590 --> 15:50.157
Bull could have been there to help,

15:50.159 --> 15:51.892
if he hadn't ran over the judge's dog.

15:51.894 --> 15:53.660
- It was a cat, actually.
- Oh.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.495
Very old. I'm kidding.

15:55.497 --> 15:56.797
I told you

15:56.799 --> 15:58.632
not to ask him to recuse himself.

15:58.634 --> 16:00.233
I made a judgment call.

16:00.235 --> 16:01.506
That's what worries me.

16:01.508 --> 16:04.004
Juror number one, Sienna White,

16:04.006 --> 16:05.539
she has a PhD in linguistics.

16:05.541 --> 16:07.451
Works as a translator for the U.N.

16:07.453 --> 16:09.176
Hard worker, rule follower.

16:09.178 --> 16:10.944
Bad for us.

16:10.946 --> 16:12.112
She'll think our clients were looking

16:12.114 --> 16:13.280
to make a fast buck.

16:13.282 --> 16:14.614
Juror number three is Larry Dane.

16:14.616 --> 16:15.949
He's a problem.

16:15.951 --> 16:17.551
He'll think our clients are reckless.

16:17.553 --> 16:19.586
But I ran out of strikes.

16:19.588 --> 16:21.263
Well, don't fret, Benny.

16:21.265 --> 16:23.089
We have a secret weapon.

16:23.091 --> 16:25.926
4,211 clients, and we get to select

16:25.928 --> 16:27.894
which ones the jury will see.

16:27.896 --> 16:29.789
- Shopping for witnesses. Fun.
- Mm-hmm.

16:29.791 --> 16:32.699
We get to pick the ones who
appeal to each of our jurors.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.568
We just need a star witness to lead off,

16:34.570 --> 16:36.072
someone with instant appeal

16:36.074 --> 16:38.038
to Sienna and Larry,

16:38.040 --> 16:40.292
someone to cement
our narrative in their minds.

16:40.294 --> 16:42.542
I will run all of our clients
through the algorithm

16:42.544 --> 16:44.077
and narrow it down to 50.

16:44.079 --> 16:46.546
Great. Let's make
a competition out of this,

16:46.548 --> 16:48.013
boiler-room style.

16:48.015 --> 16:50.517
Everyone picks their favorite
candidate and argues their case,

16:50.519 --> 16:52.619
and the mock jury
will decide the winner.

16:52.621 --> 16:53.620
Hmm.

16:53.622 --> 16:55.255
And what's the prize?

16:55.257 --> 16:56.424
$5,000 bonus.

16:56.426 --> 16:58.158
Why don't we just go with Erin?

16:58.160 --> 16:59.860
She brought us the case.

16:59.862 --> 17:01.228
Her demeanor is too amenable, Benny.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.796
The prosecution will

17:02.798 --> 17:05.365
make her out to be a novice
investor, easily pressured.

17:05.367 --> 17:08.001
They'll say she was coaxed
into buying the stocks,

17:08.002 --> 17:09.636
but there was no fraud.

17:09.637 --> 17:10.936
I'll-I'll prep her.

17:10.939 --> 17:13.138
It'll be good for her
to get hour story out.

17:13.141 --> 17:15.242
She can give a victim impact
statement after we win.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.576
Just give me a chance

17:16.578 --> 17:18.211
to see if the mock jury
resonates with her.

17:18.213 --> 17:19.279
Wow.

17:19.281 --> 17:21.748
- You do have a type.
- Come on.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.317
Okay, fine,
in the spirit of competition,

17:24.319 --> 17:26.752
she is now officially
your pick for the finals.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.255
Prove me wrong.

17:33.903 --> 17:36.563
These people should have met
with their financial advisor

17:36.565 --> 17:38.765
before giving away their life savings.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.700
Well, I've never met
my financial advisor.

17:40.702 --> 17:42.502
What... You have a financial advisor?

17:42.504 --> 17:44.571
Yeah, he handles my portfolio.

17:44.573 --> 17:45.705
She has a portfolio.

17:45.707 --> 17:47.274
How much money do you have?

17:47.276 --> 17:48.675
- None of your business.
- Ooh.

17:48.677 --> 17:50.076
What are you invested in?

17:50.078 --> 17:52.379
Okay, if you must know,
I put most of my money

17:52.381 --> 17:53.947
in aggressive S&P index funds.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.882
You know, 'cause I'm young.

17:55.884 --> 17:57.414
Wait a minute, what else
are you invested in?

17:57.439 --> 17:58.542
Medical marijuana.

18:00.889 --> 18:02.289
Hmm.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.660
Hmm.

18:06.662 --> 18:08.261
- Uh-uh.
- Huh.

18:08.263 --> 18:09.529
Who is that? Uh, don't worry about it.

18:09.531 --> 18:10.931
What... You found someone.

18:10.933 --> 18:13.066
- Why didn't you pick Erin?
- I didn't have a chance.

18:13.068 --> 18:14.137
Benny grabbed her up.

18:14.162 --> 18:16.069
Benny, huh? What's going on there?

18:16.071 --> 18:18.438
You got me, but I'll
still find someone to win this.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.408
In your dreams. The five grand is mine.

18:24.246 --> 18:25.412
Hey, hey, hey!

18:25.414 --> 18:27.180
Snooze you lose!

18:28.283 --> 18:29.916
<i>Let the games begin.</i>

18:29.918 --> 18:32.819
Erin Howland, 32.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.288
Single, teacher, fiscally responsible.

18:35.290 --> 18:37.924
<i>- And</i> donates to charity.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:37.926 --> 18:39.593
Bring her home to your
mom, not this jury.

18:39.595 --> 18:40.560
My client, Nell,

18:40.562 --> 18:41.995
and juror number three, Larry,

18:41.997 --> 18:43.563
both have backgrounds

18:43.565 --> 18:44.664
in computer science.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.133
Their analytical
and forward-thinking mindset

18:47.135 --> 18:49.002
will ensure that Larry
can relate to her.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.804
You got Larry,

18:50.806 --> 18:53.406
but the other 11 jurors
are gonna see Nell as nitpicky.

18:53.408 --> 18:54.941
Hank? No.

18:54.943 --> 18:57.177
Trustworthy,
good eye contact and posture.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.412
He looks arrogant and unapproachable.

18:59.414 --> 19:00.780
He'll alienate our best jurors.

19:00.782 --> 19:03.817
My victim has a strong
social media presence.

19:03.819 --> 19:05.452
He's opinionated, articulate.

19:05.454 --> 19:07.153
- Sienna will love him.
- Sienna will hate him.

19:07.155 --> 19:08.722
Your client's a professional victim.

19:08.724 --> 19:10.200
His Yelp posts are all complaints.

19:10.225 --> 19:11.472
Yeah, but they're funny...

19:11.497 --> 19:12.746
unlike your client,

19:12.747 --> 19:14.766
who is blocked by every
celebrity on Twitter.

19:14.791 --> 19:15.895
Jasmine's background check

19:15.897 --> 19:17.998
was spotless...
not even a traffic ticket.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.799
See what the promise of money did?

19:19.801 --> 19:23.003
Just like the stockbrokers,
you exaggerated the positives

19:23.005 --> 19:24.404
and omitted the negatives.

19:24.406 --> 19:27.140
And that is what our jury
has to understand.

19:27.142 --> 19:28.341
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but who wins?

19:28.343 --> 19:29.876
No one, yet.

19:29.878 --> 19:32.178
I want to see them after they've
gone through witness prep.

19:32.180 --> 19:34.714
Oh, well, I can do that.

19:34.716 --> 19:35.782
I don't trust you.

19:36.451 --> 19:37.617
Conflict of interest.

19:37.619 --> 19:39.285
Well, you need someone to lead with.

19:39.287 --> 19:41.021
Want to start with Erin?

19:41.023 --> 19:43.623
No. Doesn't set the right tone.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.325
Break it to her gently.

19:46.595 --> 19:49.029
We might call you to the stand,

19:49.031 --> 19:50.397
just not as the first witness.

19:51.209 --> 19:52.899
I started saving six years ago.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.402
I had $19,000.

19:55.404 --> 19:56.569
Half of it was my mother's.

19:56.571 --> 19:58.104
She was helping me buy a new place

19:58.106 --> 20:00.106
so I don't have to commute
an hour and a half

20:00.108 --> 20:01.563
to school each day.

20:02.077 --> 20:04.144
My mom needs that money.

20:04.799 --> 20:06.356
You can sit next to me

20:06.767 --> 20:09.516
at the plaintiff's table
during the trial.

20:14.856 --> 20:18.625
Did Bull okay you to offer Erin
a seat at the table?

20:18.627 --> 20:21.761
What? You saw her.
It was damage control.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.196
Where's Benny Colón?

20:23.198 --> 20:25.398
Oh, that's me. You are...?

20:25.400 --> 20:27.400
Sofia Dern. Why the hell'd
you send me a subpoena?

20:27.402 --> 20:28.868
You sent her a subpoena?

20:28.870 --> 20:30.437
Bull must have sent it.

20:30.439 --> 20:33.573
Well, uh, you were a broker
at Brannigan Trust,

20:33.575 --> 20:35.175
which means you have
relevant information.

20:35.177 --> 20:37.210
You need to tell the jury what happened.

20:37.212 --> 20:38.611
How much you gonna pay me?

20:38.613 --> 20:39.913
It doesn't work that way.

20:39.915 --> 20:40.971
The SEC involved?

20:40.973 --> 20:43.216
- No one is charging you with a crime.
- Oh.

20:43.218 --> 20:44.551
So I'm an expert witness.

20:44.553 --> 20:46.286
You're lucky you're not
at the defense table.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.888
No money, no testimony.

20:48.890 --> 20:52.192
If you don't show up, you
will be subject to arrest.

20:59.334 --> 21:00.800
Our victims all feel like victims.

21:00.802 --> 21:02.402
We need a predator right off the bat.

21:02.404 --> 21:04.637
What... you got to be kidding me.

21:04.639 --> 21:06.973
No, jury's gonna love her,
especially Sienna and Larry.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.842
Whoa!

21:08.844 --> 21:10.944
Yeah.

21:10.946 --> 21:13.146
We just found our star witness.

21:20.083 --> 21:22.496
We empathize with those who lost money,

21:22.586 --> 21:24.352
but that's the nature of the market.

21:24.406 --> 21:26.442
Mr. Fuller is too much of
a gentleman to say it,

21:26.456 --> 21:27.421
so I'll say it.

21:27.423 --> 21:28.556
The plaintiffs are unwilling

21:28.558 --> 21:31.025
to accept the consequences
of their decisions,

21:31.027 --> 21:32.560
and now they're seeking compensation

21:32.562 --> 21:33.894
from the deepest pockets.

21:33.896 --> 21:36.731
Predictable, trying to paint
our clients as greedy.

21:36.733 --> 21:38.232
We're giving them plenty of ammunition

21:38.234 --> 21:40.468
by starting off with Sofia.

21:40.470 --> 21:42.503
The jury'll see what
our clients were up against.

21:42.505 --> 21:44.105
Prep was a nightmare.

21:44.107 --> 21:45.873
She doesn't want to testify.

21:45.875 --> 21:47.608
Stick with the plan, play to her ego.

21:47.610 --> 21:50.745
She won't be able to resist
bragging about her conquests.

21:50.747 --> 21:53.047
She's gonna help us prove
the elements of fraud.

21:53.049 --> 21:55.082
She is going to be uncooperative.

21:55.084 --> 21:57.151
I'll have to treat her
as a hostile witness.

21:57.153 --> 21:58.419
Vortuba's not gonna let you ask

21:58.421 --> 22:00.354
leading questions, so don't do it.

22:00.356 --> 22:02.039
What is it with you and that judge?

22:02.041 --> 22:03.059
He's not the problem.

22:03.061 --> 22:04.360
I need her cooperative

22:04.362 --> 22:07.161
and not feeling forced;
are you on board?

22:13.829 --> 22:15.328
Where is your star witness?

22:15.330 --> 22:17.764
Building anticipation
for her testimony, no doubt.

22:20.002 --> 22:21.902
Are all parties ready to proceed?

22:21.904 --> 22:24.098
The defense answers ready for trial.

22:26.598 --> 22:28.409
- Mr. Colón?
- Yes, Your Honor.

22:28.411 --> 22:30.377
Our first witness is not here yet.

22:30.379 --> 22:32.145
I'd like to request an arrest warrant

22:32.147 --> 22:33.413
for failure to appear.

22:33.415 --> 22:35.849
It is so ordered. You have
until the end of the day

22:35.851 --> 22:38.373
to find her, but the show must go on.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.065
So we'll have a 30-minute recess,

22:40.067 --> 22:42.055
and then we'll hear opening statements

22:42.057 --> 22:43.790
and go right into witnesses.

22:50.599 --> 22:52.899
You've reached Sofia Dern's office.

22:52.901 --> 22:54.501
Straight to voice mail.

22:54.503 --> 22:56.736
None of the other witnesses
are ready to testify.

22:56.738 --> 22:58.405
- Then stall.
- How?

22:58.407 --> 22:59.339
File a motion.

22:59.341 --> 23:00.807
Argue a point of discovery.

23:00.809 --> 23:03.009
You've done this before.

23:03.011 --> 23:05.145
What... Where are you going?

23:05.147 --> 23:07.214
Shop for a car.

23:07.216 --> 23:09.683
Stall till I get back.

23:09.685 --> 23:11.484
You don't have to come up
with some bogus reason

23:11.486 --> 23:13.520
to stall and annoy the
jury; put me on the stand.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.689
Bull wants to see you
in front of a mock jury first.

23:15.691 --> 23:16.756
I'm ready.

23:16.758 --> 23:18.291
Look, we haven't finished your prep.

23:18.293 --> 23:20.393
Then let's finish it. I'm a quick study.

23:20.395 --> 23:21.928
No, we only have 30 minutes.

23:21.930 --> 23:23.797
Have you ever worked with 11-year-olds?

23:23.799 --> 23:25.498
That's an eternity.

23:26.735 --> 23:29.069
Silver Tempest, my favorite color.

23:29.071 --> 23:30.136
You have good taste.

23:30.138 --> 23:31.605
This is the sexiest car on the lot.

23:31.607 --> 23:33.740
Well, I've been eyeing it for a while.

23:33.742 --> 23:35.308
It's the perfect ride
for people like us.

23:35.310 --> 23:36.443
People like us?

23:36.445 --> 23:37.744
Someone who won't settle for

23:37.746 --> 23:39.512
anything but the best.

23:40.582 --> 23:41.982
Am I wrong?

23:41.984 --> 23:44.417
Well, cars like this
can be temperamental.

23:44.419 --> 23:46.741
I don't want to spend
my whole life in the shop.

23:46.743 --> 23:48.774
Well, that is the best
feature of them all.

23:48.776 --> 23:50.557
It's a brand you can trust.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.626
How about we take it for a spin?

23:52.628 --> 23:53.860
Why don't we?

23:55.497 --> 23:56.696
I trusted them.

23:56.698 --> 23:58.298
I had no reason not to.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.667
I'd been with Brannigan
since I was a teenager.

24:00.669 --> 24:02.936
My babysitting money was in there.

24:02.938 --> 24:04.938
This looks a lot
easier when Bull does it.

24:04.940 --> 24:06.439
I've never fallen
for anything like this.

24:06.441 --> 24:07.807
Fool me once.

24:07.809 --> 24:09.242
How's it going?

24:09.244 --> 24:10.277
Sienna's tilting her head.

24:10.279 --> 24:11.745
It looks like she's warming to Erin.

24:11.747 --> 24:12.879
I can relate.

24:12.881 --> 24:14.848
Pretty much every teenage
girl on the planet

24:14.850 --> 24:16.149
earned money babysitting.

24:16.151 --> 24:17.117
Not me.

24:17.119 --> 24:18.652
- Why not?
- All my siblings were older.

24:18.654 --> 24:19.819
They babysat me.

24:19.821 --> 24:21.021
My parents made me come up

24:21.023 --> 24:23.323
with more creative ways to make money.

24:23.325 --> 24:24.991
- Like hacking?
- Maybe.

24:24.993 --> 24:27.160
Years ago, Ms. Howland,

24:27.162 --> 24:31.031
you donated to the
Humanitarian Fund of America.

24:31.479 --> 24:32.799
I think that was the name of it.

24:32.801 --> 24:34.367
Uh, is there a point to this,
Your Honor?

24:34.369 --> 24:35.802
Charity was a fraud.

24:36.168 --> 24:39.039
Shut down by the IRS three years ago.

24:39.041 --> 24:40.540
Wait, why did Erin not tell us

24:40.542 --> 24:41.641
that she'd been conned before?

24:41.643 --> 24:43.743
By the looks of it, she just found out.

24:43.745 --> 24:46.780
It's not like we have a list
of every charity she donated to.

24:46.782 --> 24:49.215
We need to prove that her
actions were reasonable.

24:49.217 --> 24:50.417
Like Bull predicted,

24:50.419 --> 24:52.185
he's making her look uninformed,

24:52.187 --> 24:53.653
like she doesn't do her homework.

24:53.655 --> 24:54.988
HFOA was a fraud?

24:54.990 --> 24:57.157
- Are you sure?
- So I guess it's...

24:57.159 --> 25:00.193
fool you twice, isn't it, Ms. Howland?

25:00.195 --> 25:01.421
Objection!

25:04.166 --> 25:06.333
We still have other witnesses.

25:06.335 --> 25:08.601
How am I so gullible?

25:08.603 --> 25:09.636
Hey.

25:10.226 --> 25:12.505
We all make mistakes.

25:12.507 --> 25:15.547
Sometimes well-meaning,
but still life-changing.

25:16.545 --> 25:20.080
I recently had a case resurface.

25:22.159 --> 25:23.883
I sent a man to prison for nine years

25:23.885 --> 25:25.685
for a crime he didn't commit.

25:26.730 --> 25:28.089
So...

25:28.623 --> 25:30.778
I know what you're dealing with.

25:32.327 --> 25:35.969
Look, you are not a fool.

25:36.398 --> 25:37.731
Okay?

25:37.733 --> 25:39.566
You are a kind

25:39.568 --> 25:40.800
and beautiful woman,

25:40.802 --> 25:43.737
whose kindness got taken advantage of.

25:43.739 --> 25:44.971
Yeah?

25:44.973 --> 25:46.373
Yeah.

25:54.627 --> 25:56.449
I bet you love the control.

25:57.071 --> 25:58.590
Indescribable.

26:00.288 --> 26:01.812
This isn't my normal route,

26:01.814 --> 26:03.723
but we're having fun, right?

26:04.244 --> 26:06.126
Right.

26:10.098 --> 26:11.231
Why are we stopping here?
What's going on?

26:11.233 --> 26:14.182
Well, that man has
a warrant for your arrest.

26:14.184 --> 26:16.458
You're supposed to appear
in court and testify.

26:16.460 --> 26:19.305
In fact, you have about five minutes.

26:19.307 --> 26:20.673
If you hurry, you can make it.

26:20.675 --> 26:21.808
What about my car?

26:21.810 --> 26:23.576
Oh, don't worry, it's in good hands.

26:23.578 --> 26:25.311
I'll keep it warm for you.

26:27.916 --> 26:28.982
Tell the truth.

26:28.984 --> 26:30.483
Sofia Dern, come with me.

26:37.215 --> 26:38.914
Uh, Ms. Dern,

26:38.916 --> 26:42.131
so you were one of the top stockbrokers

26:42.156 --> 26:43.555
at Brannigan Trust?

26:43.557 --> 26:44.752
Are you serious?

26:44.785 --> 26:46.719
I was <i> the</i> top earner.

26:46.721 --> 26:48.621
Which means what? You were making about

26:48.623 --> 26:50.464
$300,000 a year?

26:50.466 --> 26:53.209
Last year, I netted over $750,000.

26:53.907 --> 26:55.745
Did you disclose

26:55.747 --> 26:57.433
your own interest in the stocks
to your clients?

26:57.435 --> 26:58.713
It was part of the pitch.

26:58.738 --> 27:00.147
What about when you
were planning to sell?

27:00.149 --> 27:01.041
Did you disclose that?

27:01.043 --> 27:02.027
Sometimes.

27:02.029 --> 27:03.105
But I never said I would.

27:03.107 --> 27:04.874
You used the name
"Brannigan Trust" as bait.

27:04.876 --> 27:06.008
Objection. Leading.

27:06.010 --> 27:07.009
Sustained.

27:07.011 --> 27:08.292
Would it surprise you to learn

27:08.294 --> 27:10.579
that you mentioned Brannigan Trust

27:10.581 --> 27:14.283
an average of seven times per call?

27:15.268 --> 27:17.158
You have to lead with
your strongest suit.

27:17.910 --> 27:19.322
Biometrics are telling me

27:19.324 --> 27:21.628
that even though we proved
the elements of fraud,

27:21.630 --> 27:23.693
the mirrors for Sienna and Larry

27:23.695 --> 27:25.528
don't think they'd fall for her pitch.

27:25.530 --> 27:27.063
They want more than the law requires.

27:27.065 --> 27:29.157
They need to see it
wasn't just fraudulent,

27:29.159 --> 27:30.577
but malicious as well.

27:34.172 --> 27:35.571
Excuse me, Your Honor.

27:45.049 --> 27:47.550
Were specific Brannigan
clients targeted?

27:47.552 --> 27:48.851
We call them leads.

27:48.853 --> 27:51.598
Oh. People like Erin Howland

27:51.600 --> 27:52.922
and first-time investors.

27:52.924 --> 27:53.989
Who else?

27:53.991 --> 27:55.358
Elderly clients near retirement,

27:55.360 --> 27:57.860
so we could pitch them
on a last push into wealth

27:57.862 --> 27:59.495
before they have to dip
into their savings.

28:00.119 --> 28:02.131
Sienna's getting uncomfortable.

28:02.133 --> 28:03.699
She thinks Sofia's deceptive.

28:03.701 --> 28:05.067
But our projections indicate that

28:05.069 --> 28:06.836
six of our jurors
won't hold their ground.

28:06.838 --> 28:09.801
They'll cave to Larry within
the first day of deliberations.

28:09.803 --> 28:12.575
And these leads... were they on a list?

28:15.319 --> 28:16.419
Yes.

28:16.606 --> 28:18.214
And what was that list called?

28:25.733 --> 28:27.533
The Sucker's List.

28:31.272 --> 28:33.272
<i>The Sucker's List landed on the jury.</i>

28:33.274 --> 28:34.573
Sofia's really going to help us.

28:34.575 --> 28:35.975
Why'd you call Erin to the stand?

28:35.977 --> 28:37.443
You said stall.

28:37.445 --> 28:40.679
Was anything I said unclear
when we discussed this?

28:40.681 --> 28:43.182
I didn't think she'd sway
the jury, and she didn't.

28:43.184 --> 28:44.483
Now we need a new strategy.

28:44.485 --> 28:46.218
- Why?
- I... I was in a jam.

28:46.220 --> 28:47.286
You can't lie to me,

28:47.288 --> 28:48.733
- so don't try.
- Fine!

28:48.735 --> 28:49.806
Fine.

28:49.808 --> 28:51.468
I thought she'd do better.

28:51.470 --> 28:52.625
But come on.

28:52.627 --> 28:55.361
We just started our attack, okay?

28:55.363 --> 28:57.799
- Sofia went well.
- Not well enough.

28:58.266 --> 28:59.698
We need to call Fuller.

28:59.700 --> 29:00.853
Brannigan's CEO?

29:00.878 --> 29:01.965
Mm-hmm.

29:01.967 --> 29:05.004
If we call him, Glauster
will get to cross-examine him

29:05.006 --> 29:06.138
with softball questions.

29:06.140 --> 29:07.744
Let the defense call him to the stand.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.264
We have to call him;
otherwise, it'll look like

29:09.266 --> 29:10.960
we're afraid of what he has to say.

29:11.033 --> 29:13.166
Worse, it'll look like he's
a witness for the defense.

29:13.168 --> 29:15.235
- He is.
- But it won't look that way

29:15.237 --> 29:16.903
if we call him as a witness
for the prosecution.

29:16.905 --> 29:18.205
He's smooth.

29:18.207 --> 29:20.463
Expose him for who he is:

29:20.465 --> 29:22.843
a man who made $76 million last year,

29:22.845 --> 29:24.945
while his clients lost everything.

29:24.947 --> 29:28.982
His company targeted these
people and stole their money.

29:28.984 --> 29:31.218
I need aggro-Benny. Pit bull.

29:31.220 --> 29:34.154
All right. I hear you.

29:34.156 --> 29:35.155
Do you?

29:35.157 --> 29:36.323
Yes!

29:39.228 --> 29:41.962
Brannigan Trust has a long-standing

29:41.964 --> 29:43.630
tradition of excellence.

29:43.632 --> 29:45.265
It's a respected institution,

29:45.267 --> 29:47.768
part of the fabric of so many lives.

29:47.770 --> 29:49.703
We offer small business loans...

29:49.705 --> 29:54.107
Eh, let's-let's focus on your
Alternative Investment Division,

29:54.109 --> 29:55.485
where Sofia Dern worked.

29:55.487 --> 29:58.232
Ms. Dern is an overly
aggressive salesperson.

29:58.234 --> 30:00.414
- But your company hired her.
- And we fired her.

30:00.416 --> 30:03.283
Because she was involved
in a pump-and-dump

30:03.285 --> 30:04.851
supported by Brannigan Trust.

30:04.853 --> 30:05.919
Objection. Leading,

30:05.921 --> 30:07.654
compound and badgering.

30:07.656 --> 30:10.357
Sustained, sustained and sustained.

30:10.359 --> 30:11.858
Benny's invading Fuller's space.

30:11.860 --> 30:13.093
Well, you said pit bull.

30:13.095 --> 30:14.695
Did you close the division?

30:14.697 --> 30:18.065
It was folded into another division.

30:18.067 --> 30:19.599
It was a corporate decision made

30:19.601 --> 30:21.001
due to several factors,

30:21.003 --> 30:22.869
all in the best interest
of our shareholders.

30:22.871 --> 30:24.271
But not your clients.

30:24.273 --> 30:25.887
- Is there a question coming?
- Yes, sure.

30:25.889 --> 30:27.301
Here's one:

30:27.303 --> 30:30.043
Putting all the corporate
babble aside, isn't it true

30:30.045 --> 30:32.079
that the division was nothing more than

30:32.081 --> 30:33.280
a boiler room in a high-rent office?!

30:33.282 --> 30:34.381
Objection!

30:34.383 --> 30:35.782
Sustained. Last warning.

30:35.784 --> 30:37.317
He's supposed to make
Fuller look like the bully,

30:37.319 --> 30:38.351
not the other way around.

30:38.353 --> 30:40.487
The high volume

30:40.489 --> 30:42.055
and the timing of the sale

30:42.057 --> 30:44.958
clearly shows intent to defraud,
don't you agree?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.326
No, I don't.

30:46.328 --> 30:48.261
Our brokers didn't sell penny stocks,

30:48.263 --> 30:50.530
which are what you normally associate

30:50.532 --> 30:52.632
with the boiler rooms
you're talking about.

30:52.634 --> 30:54.835
All stocks were listed on NASDAQ

30:54.837 --> 30:56.436
and the New York Stock Exchange.

30:56.438 --> 31:01.141
More than 4,000 people
lost their entire savings.

31:01.143 --> 31:03.443
And tens of thousands made money.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.512
Now, I do feel for your clients,

31:05.514 --> 31:07.514
but in the same way
that I feel for those

31:07.516 --> 31:09.783
who lose their savings in Vegas.

31:09.785 --> 31:12.052
It's about personal responsibility.

31:12.054 --> 31:14.387
You buried the fact
that you targeted Erin,

31:14.389 --> 31:16.356
all of these victims,
who were referred to

31:16.358 --> 31:18.492
as "suckers," because
they were vulnerable.

31:18.494 --> 31:21.328
Objection! Again, where's the question?

31:21.330 --> 31:22.362
Sustained.

31:22.364 --> 31:24.030
Larry's checked out.

31:24.032 --> 31:26.017
He's made up his mind,
and it's not in our favor.

31:26.019 --> 31:27.400
Your Honor, let me rephrase.

31:27.402 --> 31:28.368
We've rephrased enough.

31:28.370 --> 31:29.936
Sit down.

31:30.988 --> 31:33.707
By the way, costs are
double our initial estimate.

31:33.709 --> 31:34.975
We'll make it back.

31:34.977 --> 31:37.778
Well, if not, you may need
to hit Fuller up for a loan.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.651
Hey, we should talk.

31:43.653 --> 31:45.171
I-I know. I didn't mean
to look embarrassed

31:45.173 --> 31:46.787
in front of the jury,
but I didn't know you were gonna

31:46.789 --> 31:48.522
call me out for being vulnerable.

31:48.524 --> 31:52.159
It wasn't scripted, and I
was a little out of control.

31:54.062 --> 31:55.962
That kiss should've never happened.

31:55.964 --> 31:57.597
I know. You're right.

31:57.599 --> 31:59.699
Can't happen again.

31:59.701 --> 32:01.234
It was unprofessional.

32:01.236 --> 32:03.370
And fun.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.641
You are my client.

32:08.413 --> 32:10.443
And you're going through a lot.

32:10.445 --> 32:12.345
I don't want to take advantage of that.

32:13.758 --> 32:16.449
Maybe you're the one
who can't handle it.

32:18.987 --> 32:21.354
Congratulations. You could
sell water to a whale.

32:21.356 --> 32:22.489
Whales need water.

32:22.491 --> 32:24.424
Thanks for taking care
of my arrest warrant.

32:24.426 --> 32:25.559
Thanks for your testimony.

32:25.561 --> 32:26.626
So we're even.

32:26.628 --> 32:28.094
- Yeah.
- I'll see you around.

32:28.513 --> 32:30.797
I was hoping, uh, we
could make one more deal.

32:30.799 --> 32:32.199
I don't think so.

32:32.201 --> 32:33.733
You might enjoy it.

32:33.735 --> 32:35.502
Whatever it is, it'll cost you.

32:35.504 --> 32:38.605
We have one juror who was not
convinced by your testimony.

32:38.607 --> 32:39.706
Oh, really?

32:39.708 --> 32:41.408
Mm. Thinks he's immune to being sold.

32:41.410 --> 32:44.244
You convince him that it's not
just suckers who get scammed,

32:44.246 --> 32:45.612
you can name your price.

32:45.614 --> 32:46.880
One provision.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.583
You cannot, under any
circumstances, discuss the case.

32:49.585 --> 32:51.799
Because that would be tampering?

32:53.021 --> 32:55.021
Here's the way I think this works.

32:55.924 --> 32:58.191
It's all about the approach.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.393
At least, that's what
they taught us at the FBI.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.862
You know, one time I spent a month

33:01.864 --> 33:03.430
jogging on the same path as a target

33:03.432 --> 33:05.398
until it felt natural
to introduce myself.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.067
Sofia's on the accelerated plan.

33:07.069 --> 33:09.669
She doesn't need him to get
to turn state's witness.

33:09.671 --> 33:10.871
All she needs to do is convince him

33:10.873 --> 33:13.273
that not only suckers get conned.

33:15.677 --> 33:17.110
Didn't I see you in court?

33:17.112 --> 33:18.144
Yeah.

33:18.146 --> 33:19.212
I'm Sofia.

33:19.214 --> 33:20.380
Larry.

33:20.382 --> 33:21.911
You're not gonna get
that cake pop, are you?

33:21.913 --> 33:23.348
Oh, no.

33:23.719 --> 33:24.851
Deferential.

33:24.853 --> 33:26.052
Good first step.

33:26.054 --> 33:27.120
Very appealing to Larry.

33:27.122 --> 33:28.421
You know, it's so funny.

33:28.423 --> 33:31.524
I get to stand up there and
you get to hear all about me,

33:31.526 --> 33:33.793
but I don't get to know
anything about you.

33:33.795 --> 33:35.862
We won't get in trouble
for talking, will we?

33:35.864 --> 33:38.064
- As long as we don't talk about the case.
- Oh.

33:38.066 --> 33:39.232
I'm an accountant.

33:39.234 --> 33:41.668
You know, I love numbers.

33:41.670 --> 33:43.670
Finance is my passion.

33:47.209 --> 33:48.623
Mint?

33:49.678 --> 33:52.612
Best way to solidify trust
is to offer something.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.547
If they accept and offer
something in return,

33:54.549 --> 33:56.182
a bond has been formed.

33:56.184 --> 33:57.384
Hmm.

33:57.386 --> 33:58.685
My-my treat.

33:58.687 --> 34:00.387
And there it is.

34:04.404 --> 34:05.834
And now he'll trust her
no matter what she says.

34:05.859 --> 34:07.205
There's a table.

34:07.207 --> 34:08.728
Uh, sorry. I have to be back in court.

34:08.730 --> 34:10.730
Oh, no. No, you don't. Not yet.

34:10.732 --> 34:12.364
- You have at least 15 minutes.
- Really?

34:12.367 --> 34:13.565
Yeah.

34:15.370 --> 34:16.735
Judge. Hello.

34:16.737 --> 34:17.971
Ms. Dern?

34:17.973 --> 34:19.371
Exactly what are you two doing?

34:19.373 --> 34:22.275
Uh, we're allowed to talk, aren't we?

34:23.145 --> 34:24.945
Oh.

34:24.947 --> 34:26.246
Hey, Judge Vortuba.

34:26.875 --> 34:28.308
That's not good.

34:31.335 --> 34:33.436
Oh, don't give me that.
I know this was you, Bull.

34:33.438 --> 34:37.370
I know it was you!
Disgraceful. More cheating.

34:37.456 --> 34:40.024
I didn't, and I don't cheat, Judge.

34:40.025 --> 34:41.659
And I can have <i> you</i> disbarred.

34:41.661 --> 34:44.262
Your Honor, I had no idea
Ms. Dern was with one of the jurors.

34:44.264 --> 34:46.797
Oh, their witness was
clearly trying to influence him.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.260
The defense moves
for an immediate dismissal,

34:49.306 --> 34:50.186
with prejudice.

34:50.219 --> 34:51.985
Do you have any proof
that there was misconduct?

34:51.987 --> 34:53.286
I would be delighted to hear it.

34:53.288 --> 34:55.003
Res ipsa loquitur. It speaks for itself.

34:55.005 --> 34:57.424
If I find a scintilla

34:57.426 --> 34:59.092
of proof that there was
jury tampering...

34:59.094 --> 35:01.228
Tuba, you know better than that.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.138
Now, the prudent thing to do is to have

35:03.140 --> 35:04.998
juror number three
removed from the panel

35:05.000 --> 35:06.099
and replaced with an alternate.

35:06.101 --> 35:07.334
You've got to be kidding me!

35:07.336 --> 35:09.085
You want to be rewarded
for what you've done?

35:09.087 --> 35:12.839
Even absent any evidence
that they discussed the case,

35:12.841 --> 35:14.040
or that his opinion was altered,

35:14.042 --> 35:16.176
you still have the option
of removing the juror.

35:16.178 --> 35:17.911
No, thank you, Your Honor.

35:17.913 --> 35:19.913
Fine. We'll move to closing arguments.

35:19.915 --> 35:22.684
And you are barred from my courtroom.

35:27.956 --> 35:30.457
Well, your plan was inventive.

35:30.459 --> 35:32.125
I'll give you that.

35:32.127 --> 35:34.961
Judge Vortuba hasn't been in
a coffee shop in two years.

35:34.963 --> 35:36.896
Today he decides to
get his own beverage?

35:36.898 --> 35:38.898
Vortuba already hated us.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.367
I'm worried about Larry.

35:40.369 --> 35:43.570
We need a unanimous vote,
and we humiliated him.

35:43.572 --> 35:45.157
Total backfire.

35:45.159 --> 35:47.107
Not necessarily.

35:47.109 --> 35:49.376
True, he's embarrassed.

35:49.378 --> 35:51.711
And he's gonna blame it on me.

35:51.713 --> 35:54.681
As an unintended consequence,
we almost got Larry booted.

35:54.683 --> 35:57.384
All we have to do is
spin this in our favor.

35:57.386 --> 35:58.752
Bull.

35:58.754 --> 36:00.487
Our juror is angry.

36:00.489 --> 36:02.255
We tried to trick him.

36:02.257 --> 36:04.424
Tried.

36:04.426 --> 36:07.894
To prove fraud, we don't need
Larry to have fallen for this.

36:07.896 --> 36:10.063
All we need is to show
him he fell for Sofia,

36:10.065 --> 36:11.097
so he can still

36:11.099 --> 36:12.866
identify with our victims.

36:12.868 --> 36:16.803
shame, then anger.

36:16.805 --> 36:18.338
We got this, Benny.

36:19.675 --> 36:24.711
These plaintiffs knew
exactly what they were doing.

36:24.713 --> 36:27.647
They played the market, and they lost.

36:27.649 --> 36:29.794
So now they're suing the bank?

36:31.856 --> 36:33.386
I mean, what next?

36:33.388 --> 36:37.957
Suing the lottery
when you don't win the jackpot?

36:37.959 --> 36:39.926
That's not reasonable.

36:39.928 --> 36:43.330
Investors have to take responsibility

36:43.332 --> 36:45.598
for their own decisions.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.567
He's effective.

36:47.569 --> 36:49.402
Sienna's mirror is wavering.

36:49.404 --> 36:54.641
Being the victim of a scam
is a frustrating

36:54.643 --> 36:59.479
and embarrassing experience,
whether you fall for it or not.

37:00.849 --> 37:03.917
That's no reason to blame the victim.

37:03.919 --> 37:07.620
Blame the people
who manipulated the system

37:07.622 --> 37:09.689
with target research

37:09.691 --> 37:14.661
and sophisticated marketing
tools to con the people

37:14.663 --> 37:16.396
that they didn't think
had the wherewithal

37:16.398 --> 37:17.797
to take on the system.

37:17.799 --> 37:20.033
Brannigan Trust,

37:20.035 --> 37:21.968
a name we all thought we can trust,

37:21.970 --> 37:26.573
committed fraud
simply by making the offer.

37:26.575 --> 37:28.975
You don't have to buy into it to see it.

37:28.977 --> 37:32.112
We proved it, their brokers admitted it.

37:32.114 --> 37:34.047
Any reasonable person

37:34.049 --> 37:37.484
can see their misrepresentation
of the facts.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.555
They've been out for five hours.

37:42.557 --> 37:43.990
Bull would say that's a good thing.

37:43.992 --> 37:45.703
How much money
did we spend on this trial?

37:45.705 --> 37:47.446
A... lot.

37:48.198 --> 37:49.896
Are we gonna be okay if we lose it?

37:49.898 --> 37:51.197
What are you worried about?

37:51.199 --> 37:53.472
With your joint ventures
and your bank accounts?

37:53.474 --> 37:56.026
I told you, I don't talk about
personal finance at work.

37:56.028 --> 37:57.279
Okay, we're fine.

37:57.281 --> 37:59.739
You have nothing to worry about.

38:03.476 --> 38:04.644
Jury's back.

38:06.448 --> 38:08.848
What is it with you and this judge?

38:08.850 --> 38:11.050
TP his house or something?

38:11.052 --> 38:12.519
Chunk, no.

38:12.521 --> 38:13.920
That's very juvenile.

38:13.922 --> 38:15.174
Did you sleep with his wife?

38:15.176 --> 38:16.489
No.

38:16.491 --> 38:18.625
He thinks I kicked
my ball out of the rough.

38:18.627 --> 38:19.699
It was just an acorn.

38:19.701 --> 38:20.879
This is about golf?

38:20.881 --> 38:22.562
- Isn't everything?
- Oh, man.

38:22.564 --> 38:23.730
You cheated?

38:23.732 --> 38:25.031
I don't need to cheat with him.

38:25.033 --> 38:27.400
Vortuba's eyes are failing.

38:27.402 --> 38:28.568
He won't get checked.

38:28.570 --> 38:29.969
That's what I think
this is really about.

38:29.971 --> 38:31.838
Maybe you can give him a session
before this verdict.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.039
- Here they come!
- Can you tell us the verdict?

38:33.041 --> 38:34.409
Did they find in your favor?

38:34.411 --> 38:35.408
We won!

38:35.410 --> 38:36.887
Brannigan Trust is guilty!

38:40.749 --> 38:42.060
Excuse me.

38:43.118 --> 38:45.252
Hi. Thank you.

38:46.121 --> 38:47.554
Thank you so much.

38:47.556 --> 38:48.688
You're welcome.

38:48.690 --> 38:50.332
Thank you for everything.

38:54.529 --> 38:56.180
Be careful with her.

38:56.632 --> 38:58.798
What? No, no, no.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.700
You got it all wrong. We're not...

39:00.702 --> 39:02.168
Looks like you are.

39:04.306 --> 39:05.738
I thought about it.

39:05.740 --> 39:07.006
I wanted to.

39:07.008 --> 39:08.808
Not the right time.

39:10.078 --> 39:13.379
You tell Bull about the
Hayden Watkins thing yet?

39:14.232 --> 39:16.983
Don't want to bother the boss
with my little problems.

39:16.985 --> 39:19.118
It's not little, Benny.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.854
It's great.

39:20.856 --> 39:22.088
I'm so happy.

39:22.090 --> 39:24.023
Well, good. You deserve it.

39:24.025 --> 39:26.159
So I get my $19,000 back?

39:26.161 --> 39:28.495
And add a zero for punitive damages.

39:29.865 --> 39:30.830
That's amazing.

39:30.832 --> 39:32.098
Spend some of it on yourself.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.233
And my mom.

39:33.235 --> 39:34.501
And your mom.

39:34.503 --> 39:37.170
But you should go out
and get what you really want.

39:37.813 --> 39:39.713
Buy yourself a house.

39:39.975 --> 39:42.775
Cut down on that hour-long
commute to school.

39:45.113 --> 39:46.546
By the way,

39:46.548 --> 39:49.382
you never told me
how you got Sofia to cooperate.

39:49.384 --> 39:51.417
Easy. She's transactional by nature.

39:51.419 --> 39:52.986
Just had to come up
with the right offer.

39:52.988 --> 39:55.054
Luckily, I needed a new car.

39:55.056 --> 39:56.189
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:56.191 --> 39:57.891
Enjoy it.

39:57.893 --> 39:58.992
Thanks.

39:58.994 --> 40:01.194
Come on, I'll give you a lift home.

40:15.510 --> 40:18.101
You want to tell me
what's going on with you?

40:19.120 --> 40:20.286
It's nothing.

40:20.415 --> 40:23.316
Well, it... It's this thing
with my co-op,

40:23.318 --> 40:26.280
and it's not even worth getting into.

40:27.355 --> 40:29.593
So you'll tell me when you're ready.

40:30.665 --> 40:31.809
It's nothing.

40:35.625 --> 40:36.991
Benny.

40:37.016 --> 40:38.515
Yeah.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.807
Get it together.

40:54.716 --> 40:57.817
A wise man told me
to go after what I want.

40:57.819 --> 40:59.986
So here I am.
