<i>Customer service, how can I help you?</i>

00:14.914 --> 00:17.952
Yeah. Hi, my name's Phil
and I'm a filmmaker,

00:18.018 --> 00:19.622
and I just bought your camera.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.394
And I think it's broken,
to tell you the truth, 'cause it's...

00:22.455 --> 00:23.957
<i>What exactly is the problem?</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:25.799
Well, there's no picture, okay, bud?

00:25.859 --> 00:28.169
It's just... I'm just seeing black.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.834
These buttons don't seem to be
doing anything, you know?

00:30.897 --> 00:32.740
<i>Sir, did you remove the lens cap?</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:37.905
<i>Did that fix if?</i>

00:38.438 --> 00:41.146
No. Thanks, though, it's...
I'll figure it out.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.219
Hi. My name's Phil.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.555
I live here with my wife Daphne.
She's a great gal.

00:48.615 --> 00:51.926
Daphne's little sister, Elissa...

00:51.985 --> 00:54.556
Hot. She's getting married
to this great guy named Jon.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.795
Jon, man, you're marrying
my wife's sister,

00:57.857 --> 01:00.929
which makes us brothers.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.667
They're doing a destination wedding.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.538
That means, you go somewhere
and you get married.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.474
And they're going to Nicaragua,

01:06.599 --> 01:08.010
which means
they're going to Nicaragua.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.572
I thought, "Hey, let's get
a whole mess of cameras",

01:11.638 --> 01:13.549
"send them to, you know,
out to all the friends"

01:13.606 --> 01:16.052
"and just have 'em film
all the craziness we get into."

01:16.109 --> 01:17.144
Put it all together in, like,

01:17.210 --> 01:18.587
a nice little wedding video
for the guys 'cause...

01:18.645 --> 01:20.090
- Phil?
- They're both special to me.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.524
- That's Daph.
- Hey!

01:22.782 --> 01:23.817
Where are you?

01:24.918 --> 01:25.953
<i>- Hey-
- Hey-</i>

01:26.019 --> 01:28.295
- Hey. How are you?
- What's going on?

01:28.354 --> 01:30.129
- What's that? A camera?
- Yes, isn't that <i>cool?</i>

01:30.190 --> 01:31.328
Where'd you get a camera?

01:31.391 --> 01:33.552
I got a camera at Best Buy,
where electronics are sold.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.664
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:34.727 --> 01:35.762
How did the interview go?

01:35.829 --> 01:37.831
Well, I got a camera.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.843
So you got the job?

01:39.899 --> 01:41.776
They're gonna... It's on file.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.974
Why did you buy
a ton of cameras today?

01:44.037 --> 01:46.540
I told you, I wanted to do
a Jon and Elissa video.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.108
I'm gonna make them
an epic wedding video...

01:48.174 --> 01:49.312
No, you're not. No, you're not.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.410
- I'm returning these.
- ...with the cameras.

01:50.477 --> 01:52.718
- I'm returning them.
- Hey, no, you're not, 'cause I...

01:52.779 --> 01:54.986
I threw out all the boxes,
and there are only receipts.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.585
Okay, well,
I'll sell 'em on Craigslist, then.

01:57.650 --> 01:58.856
Baby, don't do that!

02:07.594 --> 02:08.595
What's up, everyone?

02:08.661 --> 02:11.038
Johnny and I, we've been boys ever since
we were roommates in college.

02:11.097 --> 02:12.940
You getting married, brother. I love you.

02:12.999 --> 02:15.878
Sarah here with
my fantastic boyfriend, Ivan.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.437
I can't believe
you're actually getting married.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.643
- Have you seen my passport?
- No, I haven't.

02:19.706 --> 02:20.946
They live eight blocks away,

02:21.007 --> 02:23.851
but they have to get married
in Central America.

02:23.910 --> 02:24.945
- Baby?
- Yeah?

02:25.011 --> 02:27.321
Who's making the trip to Nicaragua?

02:27.380 --> 02:28.882
- Fancy shirt.
- Yeah.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.484
We're gonna have a good time
this weekend, aren't we?

02:30.550 --> 02:31.858
Yeah, yeah.

02:31.918 --> 02:33.363
You've got, like, yogurt.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.022
Tammy!

02:35.088 --> 02:36.999
- Hey! What's up, dude?
- How you doin', man?

02:37.056 --> 02:38.933
- It's been a long time, look at you.
- Give me a hug.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.300
<i>It's so good to see you.</i>

02:40.360 --> 02:43.398
I am tearing that ass apart
this weekend.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.984
Okay, it's rolling. Get out here.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.313
Yeah, baby.

04:08.214 --> 04:09.249
- Come on.
- Is that good?

04:09.315 --> 04:10.350
It's... Yeah.

04:12.385 --> 04:15.025
- We're getting married.
- I know.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.123
Get on the bed.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.327
- Let's turn the camera off.
- No.

04:18.391 --> 04:19.461
Seriously? You wanna make a sex tape?

04:19.524 --> 04:20.526
Yeah, babe.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.935
- You're...
- So cute...

04:21.995 --> 04:23.030
Sorry.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.234
That was really hard!

04:24.297 --> 04:25.674
I'm a slut.

04:26.399 --> 04:27.434
You're a slut.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.571
You're such a big slut right now.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.680
I am. Don't laugh at me.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.240
- I am marrying a slut.
- You are.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.814
You ready to meet my oldest
and best friend in the whole world?

04:35.875 --> 04:37.548
Hell, yeah.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.988
Oh, my God, it's incredible here.

04:42.081 --> 04:43.287
Oh, my God.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.496
What are you doing?

04:51.424 --> 04:54.405
It's a wedding! It's a wedding!

04:54.460 --> 04:55.530
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck, dude!

04:55.595 --> 04:57.939
We are getting married!

04:57.997 --> 04:59.704
- Are you naked?
- Come on, Linc.

04:59.766 --> 05:00.972
- Are you naked?
- Get the fuck out.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.035
I'm gonna kill you!

05:02.101 --> 05:03.808
- Man, it's good to see you.
- Get off!

05:03.870 --> 05:06.680
- Dude, I've got a boner.
- I know. I can feel it.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.377
I couldn't wait any longer.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.079
You fucking sick bastard.

05:10.576 --> 05:11.782
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi.

05:11.844 --> 05:13.346
Hi, I'm sorry about this.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.620
I mean, we're used to it with Linc.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.003
Wait, what flight did you get in?

05:17.016 --> 05:18.552
We didn't fly. I drove.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.894
Down through Texas,
crossed the border at Ciudad JuÃ©rez.

05:20.953 --> 05:21.988
Dude, you drove to Nicaragua?

05:22.055 --> 05:23.898
Yeah, been on the road three weeks.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.126
I didn't have money.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.865
I didn't have 800 bucks
to spend on a plane ticket.

05:27.927 --> 05:30.007
- I'm not gonna miss your wedding.
- I love you, man.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.269
Hey!

05:36.336 --> 05:37.542
Boss!

05:39.205 --> 05:41.185
So you and Jon have
known each other a long time, yeah?

05:41.240 --> 05:42.981
Long time. Since our tween years, right?

05:43.042 --> 05:45.545
But you're meeting these other guys,
like, for the first time, like me?

05:45.611 --> 05:46.715
- Like these guys?
- There he is!

05:46.779 --> 05:47.814
- What's up?
- Hi.

05:47.880 --> 05:48.915
- Yeah!
- What's on?

05:48.981 --> 05:50.517
We all know what happens
when this guy's around.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.927
Yeah, we've ripped it before,
spring breaks, ski trips.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.487
Shit's gotta get weird this weekend.

05:54.554 --> 05:55.589
I want you on lock, Linc.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.066
Here's the key, my man.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.002
Totally. Yeah, take my key, too, man.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.901
Hey!

06:03.363 --> 06:05.043
- Everybody take a shot.
- One shot for me.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.737
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- Yes.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.268
You are.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.408
Yes, Nicaragua.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.576
The thing about this group of friends is,
we were kids together, you know?

06:13.639 --> 06:16.586
And now you guys are the first ones
in the group to get married.

06:16.642 --> 06:20.215
That's like a wake-up call.
We're adults now.

06:20.279 --> 06:22.623
Look at that hot little boy.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.059
I wanna sit on his face.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.994
- Yup.
- Maybe.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.328
We met on the way down
at a bar in Las Cruces.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.130
Yeah, you got so charming
after the shot of mescal.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.295
So are you, like, together now?

06:33.359 --> 06:34.929
- Sort of.
- Yeah, it's a flexible situation.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.770
Well, I'm a monogamous, <i>so</i> hands off.

06:37.830 --> 06:38.831
Okay-

06:38.898 --> 06:41.071
Look at those
pretty Bloom sisters together.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.238
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:42.301 --> 06:44.110
Six blessed years.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.650
- Six years?
- We've been together for six years.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.277
Gee, that's two years longer
than Jon and Elissa, right?

06:49.342 --> 06:51.151
They're getting married.

06:53.379 --> 06:54.740
Thanks for your observation, Phil.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.991
Well, hello, tiny dancer.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.722
- You liking it?
- Let's see. Turn around.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.561
Hold me closer, Cal.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.524
You look amazing.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.091
Runner up, Miss Cuba.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.127
Gotta love it.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.571
- You have no bulge.
- This is perfect.

07:09.629 --> 07:10.903
It's not a vagina, guys.

07:10.963 --> 07:12.363
- My man, you know what?
- It's a...

07:15.001 --> 07:16.002
Yeah!

07:16.068 --> 07:17.103
Poor Ivan.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.649
- I'm gonna party!
- Oh, my God.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.314
Honey, where's your phone?

07:28.514 --> 07:30.118
It's in my collar pocket.

07:33.019 --> 07:36.000
- Stupid move.
- Well, I didn't do it on purpose, Daphne.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.494
Jon, seriously,

07:40.560 --> 07:43.837
how did this strange person
beat me out for best man?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.144
- Really? Really?
- You never had a chance!

07:46.199 --> 07:49.271
I had a lunchbox in middle school
with Beavis on it.

07:49.335 --> 07:52.282
It is a spitting image
of this guy right here.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.045
Do it, do it.

07:59.512 --> 08:00.547
It's really good.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.551
Yeah, yeah, it's... Oh, yeah.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.320
Baby, they're here, they're here!

08:06.385 --> 08:07.455
Hey!

08:10.323 --> 08:12.599
- Mrs. Carr. Mrs. Carr?
- Hi.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.667
<i>Good.</i>

08:18.197 --> 08:19.232
Right there.

08:19.298 --> 08:20.936
- Mr. Bloom, it's amazing, sir!
- It's gorgeous.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.206
It's fucking paradise.

08:22.268 --> 08:23.611
Let's cut the crap, you guys.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.030
I know you're nothing but trouble.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.277
I know your reputation.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.546
Whenever you guys are around,
bad things happen.

08:28.608 --> 08:31.111
I know about Nassau,
I know about the motorcycle incident,

08:31.177 --> 08:33.350
- I know about the fire at Sugarbush.
- That wasn't our fault.

08:33.412 --> 08:34.890
I saw the police report, Linc.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.393
You know, Elissa's my little princess.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.020
- She's great. Beautiful girl.
- Fell from heaven.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.621
And this Wedding's gonna be perfect.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.895
And I don't want you jackasses
to do anything to ruin it.

08:43.956 --> 08:44.991
Mr. Bloom?

08:45.558 --> 08:46.725
He got nicer.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.241
- We're home, boys.
- What?

08:51.297 --> 08:53.334
This is what I'm talking about.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.174
This is crazy stuff.

08:55.234 --> 08:56.713
- That is so...
- You know what? Stop it.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.146
- No, no.
- Stop it.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.047
- We are staying here.
- I know.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.983
- Oh, my God.
- That is just not real.

09:05.177 --> 09:07.521
Can I get a minute,
and then I'll take these upstairs?

09:07.580 --> 09:10.561
You forgot one of the bags
down at reception.

09:10.616 --> 09:11.890
Thanks for doing that, baby.

09:25.631 --> 09:26.871
Guy just tried to sell me hookers.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.379
Getting that good stuff, you know.

09:29.435 --> 09:31.676
Here's to the end of a long career.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.943
To my man, Seabiscuit.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.912
There were girls in high school
that never knew his real name.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.421
Do not say that name around Elissa.

09:38.477 --> 09:39.979
- Give me that.
- Okay.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.719
You really done everything
you've wanted to do?

09:41.781 --> 09:43.419
Dude, my life now is so much better.

09:43.482 --> 09:44.517
That's bullshit.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.793
Did you ever bang twins, you know?
You ever fucked in a boat?

09:47.853 --> 09:49.230
You ever had a golden shower?

09:50.756 --> 09:52.463
Golden shower?
Some chick peeing on you?

09:52.525 --> 09:54.505
Hey, it's all about
having life experiences, guys.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.234
Yeah, Jon, have you ever
seduced a vagrant?

09:58.297 --> 10:00.334
Do not rob yourself
of life experiences, Jon.

10:00.399 --> 10:01.520
Cal will back me up on this.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.481
I'm sure you could find
plenty of down-on-their-luck vagrants

10:04.537 --> 10:05.743
in this seaport town.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.807
Let's just have a great time.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.682
Fucking Phil.

10:09.742 --> 10:11.688
What? Come on.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.553
- He's sweet.
- Okay.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.991
No, he is a motherfucking pussy.

10:16.048 --> 10:18.358
- Let me tell you something, guys.
- I don't know how I feel about that.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.419
- Let me tell you something.
- Okay. What?

10:20.486 --> 10:22.432
He has been faking orgasm.

10:22.488 --> 10:23.865
What?

10:23.923 --> 10:25.163
- Yeah, he's been faking.
- Oh, God.

10:25.224 --> 10:26.601
How do you even know
that he's faking it?

10:26.659 --> 10:27.694
Because I checked.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.603
- Your vagina?
- No, I didn't check my vagina.

10:29.662 --> 10:32.370
I used a condom,
and I checked in the condom,

10:32.431 --> 10:34.342
and there was no cream in the Twinkie.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.311
Sounds like you're not turning him on.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.905
Do you know
how to get him in the mood?

10:37.970 --> 10:39.972
Yeah. I don't need help, thank you.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.815
This is Nica, baby.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.220
We in Nica, boys.

10:46.278 --> 10:47.882
Let's get crazy!

10:49.248 --> 10:50.609
Come on, this is sacred territory.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.527
- Hello, I'm sorry.
- Come in.

10:52.885 --> 10:54.831
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Golden shower, baby.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.389
Give it a chance.

10:59.425 --> 11:00.836
So, we took this ski trip to Vermont.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.933
I was in my room
about to bang this hot-ass waitress

11:02.995 --> 11:04.770
that had the biggest fucking titties
you've ever seen.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.403
Ivan comes in with a fucking camera
and ruined the whole damn thing.

11:08.467 --> 11:09.639
Payback's a bitch, bro.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.739
You guys hear that shower? Right?

11:11.804 --> 11:13.125
Classic Ivan. All through college

11:13.139 --> 11:14.618
he'd run the shower
while he was having sex with Sarah

11:14.674 --> 11:15.675
so nobody would hear him.

11:15.741 --> 11:16.742
Come. Come.

11:17.209 --> 11:18.517
Yeah.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.254
- Oh, shit.
- What the phooey, bro.

11:21.313 --> 11:22.917
What the fuck are you doing?

11:22.982 --> 11:24.325
- Shut the fuck up.
- What are you doing?

11:24.383 --> 11:25.418
Get the fuck out of here.

11:25.484 --> 11:26.724
Are you jacking off?

11:26.786 --> 11:28.527
No. What? Are you crazy?

11:28.587 --> 11:30.328
- Look, it was just...
- Guys, get out!

11:30.389 --> 11:32.096
- Get out! Get out.
- Don't touch me.

11:32.158 --> 11:33.466
- Go, go, go. Get the fuck out.
- She touched me.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.164
- Were you jacking off?
- No, I'm not even...

11:35.227 --> 11:37.468
- You get out!
- Can you do it for camera?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.009
- Just get the fuck out of here.
- What were you doing?

11:39.065 --> 11:40.100
Come on.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.474
- Fucking two hands?
- Get out!

11:41.534 --> 11:42.877
Did you see that?

11:43.803 --> 11:45.578
She just rocked the door frame.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.618
I don't know anybody
that does it two-handed.

11:47.673 --> 11:48.879
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:48.941 --> 11:52.445
I'm in there all hot and wet, and hoping
maybe you'll come in after me.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.649
- I didn't know...
- Instead you're out here

11:53.713 --> 11:54.919
watching fucking porn?

11:54.980 --> 11:57.586
- It's just porn.
- Old poon. You fucking perv.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.096
Okay, you know what?
Let's have sex right now.

12:00.152 --> 12:01.392
I'm not gonna have sex
with you right now.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.660
Let's have sex... Why not?
Let's have sex...

12:02.722 --> 12:03.894
No, I don't want
any pad of your porn dick.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.060
Makes no difference.
Let's have sex right now.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.195
No, that's disgusting. No, I don't want it.

12:07.259 --> 12:08.533
- You just said...
- No. No.

12:08.594 --> 12:10.835
You know what?
I will see you fucking later.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.105
Fuck you guys!

12:15.868 --> 12:18.007
Man, stand and deliver.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.875
Can I just ask something?
Why two-handed?

12:21.941 --> 12:23.011
- Really, why?
- It's that big?

12:23.075 --> 12:26.454
Why two... Why like...
I've never seen that. And standing up?

12:26.512 --> 12:29.459
Let's all laugh it up.
Let's all really enjoy it.

12:29.515 --> 12:32.257
'Cause you are in for some serious shit.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.264
Phil, where are you, baby?

12:34.320 --> 12:35.663
Are you in here?

12:37.123 --> 12:39.103
- Hey. Baby-
- Hey.

12:40.025 --> 12:42.767
You're wearing fancy shirt.
Looking nice.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.570
- Looks pretty good, right?
- Yeah.

12:47.032 --> 12:48.067
Hey.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.445
You brought your Xbox to Nicaragua?

12:50.503 --> 12:51.573
I was just gonna go see

12:51.637 --> 12:55.312
if the guys wanted to
have a quick game before dinner.

12:55.374 --> 12:56.478
Okay-

12:56.542 --> 12:57.577
If that's <i>cool?</i>

12:57.643 --> 12:59.316
Sure. Totally. That's fine with me.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.379
Cool.

13:00.446 --> 13:04.394
But I was going to blow you on camera.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.926
- I was...
- Yeah, let's do that.

13:07.987 --> 13:10.365
Never mind. You gotta go play Xbox
with your buddies so...

13:10.689 --> 13:12.464
No, I don't, I don't.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.596
- This is... That can wait.
- Love you, honey.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.606
- Have fun playing Xbox.
- Daph, come on.

13:17.730 --> 13:18.765
What's up, dudes?

13:18.831 --> 13:20.504
- Nice ball cap, Jon.
- Thank you.

13:20.566 --> 13:21.636
- Hey, mates.
- Yeah, man.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.373
I like yours, too, Isaac.

13:23.435 --> 13:24.743
My name's Ivan.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.576
Ivan. I'm sorry.
Do you wanna play Xbox?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.779
Phil, there are no TVs in the resort.

13:33.112 --> 13:34.614
You look so nice!

13:35.014 --> 13:36.925
Sewing it together.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.189
- Yes, to the ladies.
- Yes.

13:40.319 --> 13:43.528
They walked in on us.
Like, right at the really big pad.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.034
The come pad.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.364
Daphne!

13:46.425 --> 13:48.632
That's sick.

13:48.694 --> 13:51.072
Can we also raise a glass
to Daphne's husband,

13:51.130 --> 13:52.290
for getting us these cameras?

13:52.298 --> 13:53.834
- Yeah, so...
- Wait a second.

13:53.899 --> 13:55.845
He had no business buying those.
He doesn't have a job.

13:55.901 --> 13:57.505
Okay, well, at least he married you

13:57.570 --> 13:59.140
instead of jacking off
while you were in the shower.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.075
- I'm fine with that.
- It's okay, S.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.087
- Yeah.
- I like that idea.

14:04.143 --> 14:09.217
So, I just wanna say that I've known,
you know, Elissa a longtime.

14:09.281 --> 14:11.852
She's my sister-in-law. Beautiful girl.

14:12.985 --> 14:17.934
I actually was fortunate enough
to see her boobs.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.567
- One time. On, like, a trip.
- What do you mean?

14:22.628 --> 14:26.440
We went to the lake
and I saw her changing.

14:26.498 --> 14:29.479
Might have...
I took a picture with my phone.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.345
- And I...
- Don't say this, man. Don't say...

14:32.404 --> 14:34.315
- I jerk off to your wife.
- Don't say that.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.876
Still. I still do this.

14:51.757 --> 14:54.670
Everyone, can I
have your attention, please?

14:54.727 --> 14:57.901
We couldn't get married
without you guys, and...

14:57.963 --> 15:01.775
We're in Nicaragua,
which I don't know if all of you know,

15:01.834 --> 15:06.408
but Jon and I have been here before,
and it's where we fell in love.

15:06.472 --> 15:10.147
Lissy, you're my younger sister,

15:10.209 --> 15:14.419
but in a lot of ways,
I look up to Lissy as my older sister.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.860
We all knew that the reason the boys
downstairs wanted to be friends with us

15:18.918 --> 15:20.398
was because we were friends with her.

15:20.452 --> 15:24.161
Jon, I... You grew on me, buddy.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.899
I grew up with three sisters.

15:29.962 --> 15:32.499
And growing up
I always wanted a brother

15:32.564 --> 15:35.545
to run around and get into trouble with.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.013
You've always been
very supportive of me

15:38.070 --> 15:41.108
and really nice to me,
and it's, you know...

15:41.173 --> 15:42.846
You didn't have to be that nice to me.

15:42.908 --> 15:45.787
There's no denying this guy's
an incredibly handsome man, right?

15:45.844 --> 15:47.881
I mean, just look
at those little baby blues.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.483
The ladies, they've always loved him.

15:49.548 --> 15:50.618
Seabiscuit.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.921
All right, all right, come on.

15:53.886 --> 15:54.887
And then he met you.

15:55.721 --> 16:00.295
And being around a good, grounded girl
really did something to him.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.168
I mean, seriously, it changed him.

16:02.227 --> 16:03.900
You are so much better because of her.

16:03.963 --> 16:08.139
Last year, when Ivan got bedbugs
and then came over to my place,

16:08.200 --> 16:11.079
and promptly gave my apartment
bedbugs as well,

16:11.136 --> 16:14.982
they were generous enough to have me
on their couch for about two weeks.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.112
And every morning
Jon would make coffee,

16:18.177 --> 16:19.383
which seemed like a simple thing,

16:19.445 --> 16:22.426
and then we would all get up
and have breakfast together.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.485
And it wasn't until the third or fourth day
that I realized

16:25.551 --> 16:27.462
that Jon doesn't drink coffee.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.056
Elissa does.

16:30.122 --> 16:33.797
But every morning, Jon makes coffee
for Elissa because he loves her.

16:51.643 --> 16:53.452
- Ready to hit the town, baby.
- Yeah!

16:53.512 --> 16:54.547
Yeah!

17:04.890 --> 17:06.061
I just wanna...

17:06.791 --> 17:08.669
There you go. I got this.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.799
Anybody want a Vicodin?

17:10.863 --> 17:11.897
Yeah.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.840
- All right. Upstairs, upstairs.
- Yeah.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.448
Can we get shots of tequila?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.755
For you, Phil. My man.

17:29.348 --> 17:31.294
One shot here for my good buddy Isaac.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.454
Come on, dude.

17:32.518 --> 17:33.963
Yeah, leave him alone.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.657
All right, guys, come on, let's do this.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.064
Yeah, cheers.

17:37.122 --> 17:41.502
Okay, Phil, no more shots, babe.
You can't handle it.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.630
No more.

17:42.694 --> 17:43.934
Phil's pad of the gang now, all right?

17:43.996 --> 17:46.596
We always do two shots of tequila
before we get the night started.

17:46.598 --> 17:47.633
It's our tradition.

17:47.699 --> 17:49.042
Come on, Phil.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.348
<i>Yeah, I'm good. Man, I'm good.</i>

17:52.404 --> 17:53.610
Cheers.

17:55.541 --> 17:56.781
Come on, yeah!

17:56.842 --> 17:57.877
No!

17:57.943 --> 17:59.081
Yeah!

18:03.449 --> 18:04.484
That's the guy from the resort, right?

18:04.550 --> 18:05.722
Should go say hi, man.

18:18.163 --> 18:19.484
Can you tell me what he's saying?

18:22.968 --> 18:24.208
Okay, I'm not repeating that.

18:40.919 --> 18:42.830
Damn, I'm so tapping that ass tonight.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.993
Really? 'Cause I think she's vibing me.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.401
Dude, I can tell you right now,
she is not vibing you.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.564
Tammy and I have had this whole thing
brewing since college, bro.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.108
Yeah? You've been trying since college,
and you never hit that?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.972
This girl's not
your typical piece of ass, bro.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.910
She's fucking mysterious. Look at her.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.003
The whole time we've known her,

18:57.069 --> 18:58.309
she's never hooked up
with anyone we knew.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.646
I know.
We thought she was into the ladies.

19:00.706 --> 19:03.619
Yeah, 'cause she has shod hair,
like a boy?

19:04.676 --> 19:06.053
Like a hot boy?

19:06.111 --> 19:08.071
- Let me show you how it's done, bro.
- All right.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.649
You still haven't sent in
your med school applications?

19:18.657 --> 19:20.295
First off, I gotta get my MCATs up.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.566
And then I wanna concentrate on
getting some more enrichment credits

19:22.628 --> 19:23.732
from the University of Phoenix online.

19:23.795 --> 19:26.799
Dude, I fell like that's holding up
your entire life.

19:26.865 --> 19:27.969
What about Sarah?

19:28.033 --> 19:29.478
You gonna finally pull the trigger?

19:29.535 --> 19:31.947
That's a big question, my man.
That's running around in here.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.039
You gotta figure it out, you know.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.176
She's a great girl,
she's not gonna hang around.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.119
How'd you know
that Elissa was the right one?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.281
You know, did it come to you
in a dream?

19:39.344 --> 19:41.153
Did you have a vision quest?

19:42.347 --> 19:44.452
No, I don't know. I just...

19:45.184 --> 19:50.224
I asked myself whether I could
imagine my life without her, you know?

19:50.289 --> 19:52.599
And the answer was clear.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.001
That makes sense.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.901
What do you think
my answer to that question would be?

20:00.566 --> 20:02.512
Dude, how the fuck should I know?

20:02.568 --> 20:04.013
- I'm sorry!
- Honestly, come on!

20:04.069 --> 20:06.481
- I need your help, man.
- You're fucking hopeless.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.881
Yes, I am.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.445
Looks like
Tammy left her phone behind.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.448
- Ivan...
- What's up?

20:13.512 --> 20:14.752
Tammy left her phone behind.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.458
Watch your step.

20:20.619 --> 20:21.757
Hey.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.740
"What's up hottay?"

20:34.766 --> 20:39.181
How about a sensual massage?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.809
I want you face down.

20:41.873 --> 20:43.147
Lights off.

20:45.344 --> 20:46.550
And bare-assed.

20:51.483 --> 20:52.826
Oh, my God. He's so excited.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.295
Yes. Yes.

20:54.353 --> 20:55.923
He's going. He's on his way.

20:55.988 --> 20:56.989
HE'S going?

20:57.055 --> 20:58.261
All right. All right.

21:00.292 --> 21:01.327
All right, let's go.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.032
- Look at him go.
- Go my friend.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.008
Go to your date with destiny.

21:07.332 --> 21:08.538
Come on, boy.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.772
This is incredible.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.781
You want to bust in on me, asshole?

21:11.837 --> 21:12.872
Give him two minutes,

21:12.938 --> 21:14.898
then we'll round everybody up
and follow him back.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.320
Make sure
you keep shooting. Everything.

21:22.681 --> 21:23.682
What's going on?

21:24.449 --> 21:26.793
It is time for you
to unlock your inner mad man, Linc.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.297
I gave you the key, man.

21:28.353 --> 21:29.923
Guys, just don't break anything.

21:29.988 --> 21:31.365
I can promise you,

21:31.423 --> 21:33.767
that we will not ruin your wedding, Jon.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.998
But things are going to get
very, very rough for Cal right now.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.769
- You ready?
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.150
Hey, baby.

21:52.210 --> 21:54.121
It's dark, just like you said.

21:57.582 --> 21:59.528
I wanna feel those soft hands.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.133
No oil?

22:09.661 --> 22:11.197
Dirty girl.

22:11.263 --> 22:12.936
God, you feel amazing.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.376
Fuck.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.985
Yeah, I want that fucking tongue
all over me,

22:28.046 --> 22:29.548
you sexy little bitch.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.389
God, I'm so fucking huge right now.

22:47.666 --> 22:48.906
Oh, my God.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.351
Shit. He's going to fuck him in the ass?

23:01.646 --> 23:02.750
What's he doing?

23:10.288 --> 23:12.598
All right, you know what?
Just go slow, okay?

23:12.657 --> 23:14.568
He's hosing him down.

23:16.027 --> 23:17.507
No, no. Hold on. That's way too much.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.265
Linc!

23:19.331 --> 23:20.935
What the fuck? Fuck!

23:20.999 --> 23:23.445
- I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
- Why?

23:23.502 --> 23:25.709
- I'm so sorry.
- What do you have to gain from that?

23:27.739 --> 23:28.740
Fuck!

23:29.674 --> 23:30.709
I'm so sorry.

23:30.776 --> 23:32.881
I'm so sorry. It was Ivan's idea.

23:32.944 --> 23:34.821
You are still pissing right now.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.247
I can't stop.

24:12.384 --> 24:13.863
Come here, give me a hug.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.126
It's just a joke. Come on.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.258
It was hilarious.

24:24.696 --> 24:26.937
Ivan, that motherfucker is going down.

24:26.998 --> 24:27.999
What's the plan, man?

24:28.066 --> 24:30.569
Linc, get the fuck out of here!

24:30.635 --> 24:32.239
Dude, it was Ivan's idea.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.305
Yeah, but you did it.

24:33.371 --> 24:35.180
Bro, you pissed on me!
Who the fuck does that?

24:35.240 --> 24:37.686
Cal, do you know
where your linen closet is?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.478
Phil.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.062
Look what I got.

24:59.831 --> 25:00.832
Ivan.

25:10.575 --> 25:11.918
Holy shit.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.690
Oh, my God.

25:19.451 --> 25:20.452
Oh, no.

25:32.163 --> 25:34.268
I would like to say something.

25:34.332 --> 25:36.903
Quickly, if everyone could...

25:36.968 --> 25:38.572
Could listen for a second.

25:38.637 --> 25:44.986
To my girlfriend, my beautiful girlfriend
of six wonderful years.

25:46.111 --> 25:47.818
I want to marry you

25:48.547 --> 25:51.960
more than anything I've ever wanted
in my entire life.

25:52.017 --> 25:54.122
- We haven't talked about this.
- I'm so sorry.

25:54.286 --> 25:58.029
I have not thanked you
every single second of every single day

25:58.089 --> 26:00.091
for how you change my life.

26:00.158 --> 26:01.899
I have taken you for granted.

26:04.596 --> 26:05.904
Marry me.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.409
I love you so much.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.309
- Yes.
- Yeah?

26:11.369 --> 26:13.610
Like, yes? Really yes, though.

26:13.672 --> 26:14.878
- Yes.
- Absolutely?

26:14.940 --> 26:15.975
Yes.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.327
Thank you.

26:30.388 --> 26:31.423
Thank you so much.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.797
Cal, come and show us.

26:49.007 --> 26:50.247
Hey!

26:50.308 --> 26:52.345
You were doing shots,
you were doing shots.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.617
- No. No.
- Yes.

26:54.679 --> 26:56.522
Yeah. Okay.

26:56.581 --> 26:59.289
- Guys, is my wife beautiful?
- Yeah.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.386
Thank you.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.590
Very beautiful.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.297
Okay. No. All right. No.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.664
You need water, he needs water.

27:05.724 --> 27:08.204
No, I need tattoos?

27:08.259 --> 27:09.294
Yeah!

27:09.361 --> 27:10.738
I must get tattoos.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.775
Jon, in college, I was, like, this close

27:12.831 --> 27:14.936
to getting a huge cobra tattoo
on my chest.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.673
It would have looked so fucking stupid.

27:16.735 --> 27:19.739
It would look pretty fucking Phil, right?

27:19.804 --> 27:21.181
Yeah!

27:27.812 --> 27:29.849
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

27:29.914 --> 27:31.359
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

27:31.416 --> 27:32.793
- I'm good.
- You?

27:32.851 --> 27:33.886
You're having fun?

27:33.952 --> 27:36.125
I'm having so much fun. You're so great.

27:36.187 --> 27:37.757
- Thank you.
- I love you.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.233
- I love you.
- I love you.

27:39.290 --> 27:41.395
- I love you.
- I can't wait

27:41.459 --> 27:44.440
- until we're brother and sister.
- Me, too.

27:47.365 --> 27:49.038
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

27:49.100 --> 27:50.511
What the fuck, Phil!

27:50.568 --> 27:51.842
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

27:51.903 --> 27:53.177
Okay, no, Phil...

27:53.238 --> 27:54.683
Stupid!

27:54.739 --> 27:56.446
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.548
- That's all right.
- Phil.

27:58.643 --> 28:01.180
I can feel it. It's,
like, pooling in my bra.

28:01.579 --> 28:04.321
Okay, I think I need to go to bed.

28:04.382 --> 28:05.486
You are going to go, too, right?

28:05.550 --> 28:07.552
I'm going to go to bed really soon, okay?

28:08.486 --> 28:10.124
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.725
Okay, I'm just going to go
wash my boobs.

28:12.791 --> 28:14.793
- Okay.
- Elissa.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.668
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.441
It's so gross.

28:20.498 --> 28:22.307
- I'm so happy for you guys.
- Thank you.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.870
I'm so happy. I mean, you did it.
You tamed him.

28:24.936 --> 28:26.711
You tamed the Seabiscuit.

28:26.771 --> 28:29.342
- Wait, what is Seabiscuit?
- Oh, my God! You don't know.

28:29.407 --> 28:31.011
Seabiscuit, Jon's nick name
in high school.

28:31.076 --> 28:32.077
What does it mean?

28:32.143 --> 28:34.714
It's like, the horse, like he's a stallion.

28:34.779 --> 28:37.919
A guy loses his virginity at age 13.
He deserves a nickname.

28:37.982 --> 28:39.290
- Thirteen, really?
- Thirteen.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.091
I'm serious. It's incredible, right?

28:41.152 --> 28:43.758
And I feel like it's a good thing,
'cause he started so young

28:43.822 --> 28:46.564
and he fucked so much,
he got it all out of his system.

28:46.624 --> 28:47.830
And then he met you.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.270
And, like, everything
in the world changed.

28:51.529 --> 28:52.735
You get some sleep, okay?

29:01.239 --> 29:02.843
Jon-Jon.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.581
Come on, man.
We're back together one last time.

29:05.643 --> 29:07.020
It's a dream team. You owe us it.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.887
- Okay, one shot.
- Yeah!

29:10.682 --> 29:11.752
Yeah!

29:28.700 --> 29:31.943
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

29:54.125 --> 29:55.729
What's up, dude?

30:00.932 --> 30:02.969
Jon! God, you're...

30:16.047 --> 30:17.458
How handsome are you?

30:31.396 --> 30:32.397
Whoops.

30:34.065 --> 30:35.339
Look, you're ready
to get married, right now?

30:35.400 --> 30:36.777
I think I'm gonna go down
into the village

30:36.835 --> 30:39.076
and try to see if I can find
like a medicine man

30:39.137 --> 30:40.275
or a shaman or something.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.249
Come back up here and see
if we can just make things official.

30:42.307 --> 30:43.308
You fucking idiot.

30:43.374 --> 30:44.512
She loves me.

30:44.576 --> 30:45.577
She loves me.

30:45.643 --> 30:47.054
It's beautiful.

30:48.379 --> 30:50.381
I don't believe you, but thank you.

30:50.448 --> 30:52.758
So, how long do you think
he's been planning to ask you?

30:52.817 --> 30:54.353
I don't know. I'm just in shock.

30:54.419 --> 30:55.864
You know?
I just, like, stared at him all night,

30:55.920 --> 30:56.921
I couldn't even sleep.

30:56.988 --> 30:59.161
Jon-Jon, wake up.

30:59.490 --> 31:00.525
<i>Jenny BOY -.</i>

31:00.592 --> 31:02.873
- good morning, sunshine.
- Let's go, Johnny boy. Big day.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.037
Johnny boy.

31:05.997 --> 31:07.635
- You're okay?
- You're okay.

31:08.066 --> 31:09.067
Shit.

31:10.735 --> 31:11.873
- Get up my man.
- Man.

31:11.936 --> 31:14.007
This is gonna be a great wedding.

31:14.072 --> 31:17.110
And look who it is.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.177
Girl, come here.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.190
Good morning.

31:21.246 --> 31:23.123
Beautiful bride, yeah!

31:24.582 --> 31:25.652
What the fuck?

31:30.088 --> 31:31.089
Phil?

31:37.428 --> 31:38.600
Stop it.

31:38.663 --> 31:40.006
Come here, Phil.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.909
Wake up.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.815
Jeez, man.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.354
This is the worst day of my life.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.947
Jon, get up!

31:55.680 --> 31:57.091
Dude, come on.

31:58.716 --> 32:00.696
- What's that man?
- Hello.

32:01.119 --> 32:02.598
Yo, what is that? Is that a scrape?

32:02.654 --> 32:04.634
It's probably just a scratch
or something.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.191
Stop staring at my dick.

32:07.025 --> 32:08.368
That's a bite mark.

32:08.893 --> 32:09.894
It's not a bite mark.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.339
Listen Jon, I know a bite mark
when I see it. Okay?

32:12.397 --> 32:13.535
I've studied this shit.

32:13.598 --> 32:16.477
They are tooth marks,
there is no doubt about that.

32:16.534 --> 32:17.569
All right?

32:17.635 --> 32:18.943
You had a human mouth on your penis.

32:19.003 --> 32:20.641
You had a blow job last night.

32:22.407 --> 32:23.909
Shit.

32:23.975 --> 32:25.249
You think Elissa did it?

32:25.310 --> 32:27.449
I was in the casita all night.
Elissa never left.

32:27.512 --> 32:28.889
Really?

32:28.947 --> 32:30.051
Holy shit.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.321
- I slept very well.
- Yes, you did.

32:32.383 --> 32:34.488
- I'm getting married today.
- You are.

32:34.552 --> 32:35.758
I feel amazing.

32:35.820 --> 32:37.891
- You look beautiful.
- This place is magical.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.560
- Seriously.
- Who sucked your dick?

32:39.624 --> 32:41.103
I don't know. I can't remember.

32:41.159 --> 32:42.467
I could never do that to my fiancÃ©e.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.200
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?

32:44.262 --> 32:46.868
- Asshole.
- Just saying, it's a sacred commitment.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.569
Man.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.507
Look who just arrived.

32:51.569 --> 32:52.843
Yeah, man.

32:52.904 --> 32:55.282
You got drunk
and slept in that bathroom.

32:55.340 --> 32:56.444
Who does that, man?

32:56.507 --> 32:58.714
- Phil does, baby.
- You do.

32:58.776 --> 33:00.756
Jon, you got a blow job?

33:00.812 --> 33:03.383
This is nuts, you guys.

33:03.448 --> 33:05.086
- All right, I'm out of here.
- Pally down, Phil.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.992
- I got to go.
- Yeah.

33:07.051 --> 33:09.224
See the old ball and chain.
Get ready for the wedding.

33:09.287 --> 33:11.358
- Phil. Phil. Phil?
- What's up, man?

33:11.422 --> 33:13.342
You know you can't tell Daphne
about this, right?

33:13.391 --> 33:15.428
Dude, you can count on me, man.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.473
I'm going to be your brother-in-law.

33:17.528 --> 33:19.769
It's going in the Bank of Phil,

33:19.831 --> 33:22.710
filed under "B" for bros.

33:22.767 --> 33:25.577
I feel like I'm dreaming. I don't know.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.443
Ivan just posted something
to our video blog.

33:28.506 --> 33:31.043
I bet it's like a little wedding message
from the boys.

33:31.876 --> 33:34.083
<i>Johnny boy. Good morning, sunshine.</i>

33:34.145 --> 33:36.421
<i>Hey, wake up, it's your wedding day.</i>

33:37.648 --> 33:39.321
Is he puking?

33:39.384 --> 33:40.761
Let's turn that off.

33:40.818 --> 33:42.229
<i>Wake up!</i>

33:44.088 --> 33:45.624
<i>This is the worst day of my life.</i>

33:45.890 --> 33:47.370
Wait, what happened? Turn it back on.

33:47.725 --> 33:49.705
It says "file not found."

33:50.261 --> 33:52.741
Worst day of his life?
Did you hear that?

33:53.564 --> 33:55.669
What kind of night did he have? What...

33:56.100 --> 33:57.807
It's... I'm sure it's fine.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.870
- Yeah, it's fine.
- It's fine.

33:58.936 --> 34:01.075
It's no big deal.
They were just drinking a little.

34:01.739 --> 34:02.979
I'm an idiot.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.179
I uploaded it by mistake.

34:04.242 --> 34:06.688
- I don't need this, buddy. Okay?
- Don't worry, I deleted it.

34:06.744 --> 34:08.417
Let me just get this.

34:09.013 --> 34:10.286
Rice thing worked.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.956
Speak of the she-devil.
Hey, Daph-Daph.

34:15.018 --> 34:17.522
- Hello, what are you doing?
- Just hanging with the dudes.

34:17.588 --> 34:20.262
- Nothing. Nothing is wrong or anything.
- Put it down.

34:20.824 --> 34:22.600
- Babe, I'm not hiding anything.
- Put it down, mate.

34:22.659 --> 34:24.661
- Babe, what do you think I'm hiding?
- Shut up.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.369
- Phil.
- Nothing bad happened last night.

34:27.799 --> 34:28.800
Hey. Daphne?

34:28.866 --> 34:32.837
Phil's a little embarrassed about his...
His shirt got ruined last night.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.007
- Yeah?
- Yeah, fancy shirt.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.949
- What?
- He completely destroyed.

34:36.007 --> 34:39.250
So, we have a lot of getting ready to do,
we'll see you at the ceremony.

34:39.310 --> 34:40.618
- Is it ruined?
- Yeah.

34:40.678 --> 34:41.884
It's just some stains.

34:41.946 --> 34:44.222
Just have to run it to the drycleaners.
Fancy shirt will be fine.

34:44.282 --> 34:46.558
There's a big stain
right on the back. Yeah.

34:46.617 --> 34:47.618
Right... What?

34:47.851 --> 34:49.922
- There.
- What the heck, man?

34:52.989 --> 34:54.128
What the heck?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.134
Now, she thinks that's what
you're lying about, man.

34:58.196 --> 35:00.198
Look what you did to fancy shirt!

35:00.498 --> 35:01.602
Are you okay, Daphne?

35:01.666 --> 35:03.767
I just... I really loved fancy shirt.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.175
He has changed a lot
in the last few years.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.682
But the second he gets with those guys,
it's like...

35:07.738 --> 35:09.240
I mean, he just needed to meet you.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.287
- This good girl.
- Sarah, no.

35:11.342 --> 35:13.379
I'm not always a good girl.

35:14.178 --> 35:16.180
Why did he and his friends
get to have all the fun?

35:16.247 --> 35:18.955
I mean, no one even asked me.
I would have stayed out.

35:19.016 --> 35:21.587
I would have gotten so smashed.

35:21.652 --> 35:24.633
I mean, I didn't even let you guys
throw me a bachelorette party.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.691
Now I'm getting married.

35:26.757 --> 35:27.861
So, let's do it.

35:27.925 --> 35:29.734
Let's have a bachelorette party,
right now.

35:29.794 --> 35:30.932
- Yes.
- Yes.

35:30.995 --> 35:33.407
- Yes.
- That's exactly what we are going to do.

35:33.464 --> 35:35.102
I'm getting married in five hours.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.967
We can't let those jackasses
have all the fun.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.038
Yeah, let's have some fun.

35:38.102 --> 35:39.782
I got some fruit salad back in my casita-.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.340
Yeah, or alcohol.

35:42.073 --> 35:43.108
I have an idea.

35:43.174 --> 35:45.017
I mean, what if she finds out?

35:45.076 --> 35:46.397
How could she ever find out, man?

35:46.711 --> 35:48.156
- I don't know.
- Stop worrying.

35:48.212 --> 35:49.919
We are fine. Let's go put on suits.

35:50.281 --> 35:51.282
Phil?

35:52.984 --> 35:54.258
What's up, man?

35:54.318 --> 35:55.661
Phil, what are you doing?

35:56.087 --> 35:57.088
What's going on?

35:58.022 --> 35:59.262
You were being really funny last night.

35:59.323 --> 36:03.203
You were drunk, it was like great,
classic wedding material kind of stuff.

36:03.261 --> 36:04.535
It was...

36:04.595 --> 36:07.701
I thought it would be good
to get hidden camera stuff, so I...

36:07.765 --> 36:09.301
I set up a camera right here.

36:09.367 --> 36:10.641
- You left it running?
- Holy shit.

36:10.701 --> 36:12.374
What the fuck is wrong with you.

36:12.436 --> 36:15.246
I'm going to talk to security.

36:15.306 --> 36:17.616
'Cause that's... That's theft.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.416
Are you kidding me? For real?

36:23.581 --> 36:25.561
So, some girl blew me,
swiped Phil's camera,

36:25.616 --> 36:27.459
and now she is gonna
show it to everyone.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.519
I'm fucked.

36:28.586 --> 36:31.362
We've been filming this?
All of this? Turn it off.

36:31.422 --> 36:32.833
Ivan, turn it off! Okay?

36:32.890 --> 36:34.096
- Let's not be hasty, though, Jon.
- Jesus!

36:34.158 --> 36:36.263
Delete everything
from this morning, please.

36:36.327 --> 36:39.900
I don't like hearing that, though,
because this is some good back...

36:39.964 --> 36:41.684
You might want this later.
That's all I'm...

36:41.699 --> 36:43.804
- That's all I'm saying.
- Will I?

36:43.868 --> 36:46.075
- Really? Will I want this later?
- Shut the fuck up.

36:46.137 --> 36:48.014
- No, I don't think so. Sit down.
- Shut the fuck off.

36:48.072 --> 36:49.278
- Turn it off.
- Turn off the camera.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.512
Ripped Phil's shirt.

36:50.575 --> 36:52.953
- I got final cut, man.
- Shut this thing off.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.325
For room... What room are we?

37:00.451 --> 37:01.794
Hey, come up in four right now.

37:01.852 --> 37:04.958
You have basically handed over
your entire relationship to this girl.

37:05.022 --> 37:06.126
Do you understand that?

37:06.190 --> 37:07.567
She's driving the whole thing.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.696
You're just in the back seat
riding like a little bitch.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.434
Phil, you don't want to be a little bitch.
Do you?

37:12.496 --> 37:14.016
No, I don't want to be a little bitch.

37:14.031 --> 37:15.339
You're a whipped man, Phil.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.935
Okay, so what do I do?

37:17.001 --> 37:19.641
Okay, what's something
that she hates about herself?

37:21.706 --> 37:23.549
She thinks her arms are too fat.

37:23.608 --> 37:26.350
Okay. Next time
she starts giving you shit,

37:26.410 --> 37:29.220
you're gonna look at her in the face
and you are going to say,

37:29.280 --> 37:31.453
"Hey, you've put on some weight."

37:31.515 --> 37:33.756
And Phil the man,
he doesn't like that shit.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.989
You just want me to
start a fight with her?

37:36.053 --> 37:37.327
Exactly.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.527
See, this way,
if you start fighting with her,

37:39.590 --> 37:41.310
she'll forget the fact that you were lying.

37:41.325 --> 37:42.736
Then we're just, like,
yelling at each other.

37:42.793 --> 37:44.204
Come on dude, toughen up.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.037
You need to seriously get it together.

37:46.998 --> 37:50.002
I do have it together, man. But she...

37:50.568 --> 37:51.979
Look at yourself in the mirror.

38:02.913 --> 38:04.722
Let's have some fruit salad.

38:30.608 --> 38:31.985
Now don't be shy.

38:32.510 --> 38:35.013
- Don't be shy.
- Guys, you got me shots?

38:35.479 --> 38:37.686
It's getting crazy in the house.

38:38.115 --> 38:39.321
Just you wait.

38:44.388 --> 38:45.765
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.665
What's happening?

38:48.826 --> 38:50.271
Oh, my God.

38:50.361 --> 38:51.465
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

38:51.529 --> 38:53.873
You said you wanted
a bachelorette party!

38:55.700 --> 38:57.270
Wait, isn't he the busboy?

38:57.335 --> 38:59.008
Not today, he's not.

39:08.679 --> 39:09.987
Yeah!

39:12.216 --> 39:13.217
Yes!

39:19.423 --> 39:20.925
Yeah.

39:21.459 --> 39:22.961
Yeah!

40:08.672 --> 40:10.083
Yeah!

40:20.351 --> 40:21.386
Oh, my God!

40:26.924 --> 40:28.403
I came.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.063
I came everywhere.

40:30.127 --> 40:32.004
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

40:45.276 --> 40:46.380
Give me your excited strut.

40:47.511 --> 40:49.855
- That's horrible.
- I'm just excited, guys.

40:49.914 --> 40:51.484
- To Johnny.
- To Jon, boy.

40:51.549 --> 40:53.324
Jon-o-lis. Yeah!

40:53.384 --> 40:54.692
You guys can have my leftovers tonight.

40:54.752 --> 40:55.856
- Thank you, thank you.
- How about that?

40:55.920 --> 40:57.729
I have to work so hard,
this guy gets it all.

40:57.788 --> 40:59.028
<i>- Yeah.
- Go, go, go.</i>

40:59.089 --> 41:00.159
Johnny boy.

41:00.224 --> 41:01.794
What if this girl already
showed somebody the video?

41:01.859 --> 41:04.430
That's not an option,
we would have found out by now.

41:04.495 --> 41:06.736
I just think I should probably
tell Elissa before she sees it.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.437
- No.
- I think that's the only move, Jon.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.275
I can never keep something like that
from my fiancee.

41:10.334 --> 41:12.405
What the fuck are you saying? Shut up.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.074
- It was a fake engagement ring, dude.
- Guys, guys.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.981
Guys, guys, guys, this was our bad.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.110
We're gonna make it right, okay?

41:17.174 --> 41:19.279
We're gonna find out who did it.
We're gonna keep it under wraps.

41:19.343 --> 41:21.380
- Yeah.
- We're gonna muzzle this dick-sucker.

41:23.214 --> 41:24.249
Come on.

41:26.417 --> 41:29.830
Hey, guys, last night got crazy, right?

41:29.887 --> 41:32.197
Did it get crazy for you?
'Cause it got crazy for me.

41:32.256 --> 41:34.862
It was like I couldn't even control myself.

41:34.959 --> 41:35.994
You... Did you get like that?

41:36.060 --> 41:39.098
Some beautiful women like yourselves,
you just went to bed early?

41:39.163 --> 41:40.198
I'm not buying that shit.

41:40.264 --> 41:41.743
Hi. Love your dress.

41:41.799 --> 41:43.142
Do you mind if I look at your teeth?

41:43.200 --> 41:44.201
Gorgeous teeth.

41:44.268 --> 41:45.303
- Well, thank you.
- Can I see them for a sec?

41:45.369 --> 41:46.677
Can I just look at your goddamn teeth
for a second?

41:46.737 --> 41:48.182
- All right.
- I think I hooked up with someone.

41:48.239 --> 41:50.776
I don't even remember.
Did you hook up with anybody?

41:50.841 --> 41:52.320
You didn't spend time
on your knees last night?

41:52.376 --> 41:55.516
Could I offer you a taste of
one of the most beautiful fruits on earth,

41:55.579 --> 41:57.149
found here in Nicaragua?

41:57.214 --> 41:58.522
It's juicy this time of year.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.351
Okay-

42:02.887 --> 42:04.423
All right, open.

42:04.922 --> 42:07.493
Open. Open up there.

42:07.558 --> 42:09.094
Okay, thank you.

42:09.159 --> 42:10.536
Dude, what the hell was that?

42:11.028 --> 42:12.598
This is Cheryl's bite mark.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.839
And this is Jon's penis.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.701
Dude, come on!

42:16.767 --> 42:18.371
- It's a <i>cool</i> dick.
- Yeah.

42:19.069 --> 42:20.776
As you can see,
the spread just does not match.

42:20.838 --> 42:22.977
Cheryl has been vindicated
by the evidence.

42:23.374 --> 42:26.253
- What about Linc's girl?
- No, she was with me all night.

42:26.310 --> 42:28.256
You told me you were blacked out.

42:29.013 --> 42:30.253
- Come on.
- Guys.

42:30.648 --> 42:31.752
Quick question for you.

42:31.815 --> 42:32.987
Have you tried
the tropical fruit down here?

42:33.050 --> 42:35.052
- It is divine.
- Knock it off, dude.

42:35.119 --> 42:37.463
- I need her bite mark, goddamn it.
- What is going on?

42:37.521 --> 42:38.659
It's kind of a long story.

42:38.722 --> 42:41.066
We think someone might have
blown Jon last night.

42:42.826 --> 42:44.362
Do you know something?

42:44.428 --> 42:45.429
No, nothing.

42:45.496 --> 42:46.770
Maggie.

42:46.830 --> 42:48.550
Did you just see her face?
It's totally her.

42:48.599 --> 42:51.842
It's not her, okay?
I know her, she's not like that.

42:51.902 --> 42:55.179
You told me that she fellated you
10 minutes after you met her.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.741
- It's different.
- Yeah.

42:56.807 --> 42:58.718
We had an emotional connection.

42:58.776 --> 43:01.780
- Hey, you guys.
- Dude, get down. Jon's coming.

43:01.845 --> 43:02.915
I'm freaking out.

43:02.980 --> 43:04.550
I'm about to get married, okay.

43:04.615 --> 43:06.219
I can't hide this from her.
I have to tell her.

43:06.283 --> 43:08.092
No, no, no, dude, dude, dude.
Dude, listen to me.

43:08.152 --> 43:09.722
I know you want to
do the right thing here,

43:09.787 --> 43:11.767
but you tell her right now,
you're just gonna ruin her wedding.

43:11.822 --> 43:13.782
Seriously, it's the most selfish thing
you can do.

43:13.824 --> 43:14.825
Fuck.

43:15.426 --> 43:16.837
I'm such an asshole.

43:18.662 --> 43:19.868
That's a surprising bit of wisdom

43:19.930 --> 43:22.570
from a man who 12 hours ago
urinated in Cal's mouth.

43:22.633 --> 43:23.703
Shut the fuck up.

43:51.562 --> 43:55.169
I'm just saying, I don't think people
take an option of fish

43:55.232 --> 43:56.939
at a wedding, seriously.

43:57.001 --> 44:00.380
If you allow me to take the reins on this,
I'm thinking two meats...

44:00.437 --> 44:01.472
Baby.

44:01.538 --> 44:03.279
Think two meats,
maybe a vegetable medley.

44:04.541 --> 44:06.248
How's fancy shirt?

44:06.310 --> 44:07.482
Ruined.

44:07.544 --> 44:09.285
It's totally ruined. I ruined it.

44:09.346 --> 44:10.586
Awesome.

44:30.501 --> 44:31.775
This is a mistake.

44:33.637 --> 44:34.843
What is, the wedding?

44:34.905 --> 44:36.475
Yeah, the wedding.
She's making a mistake.

44:36.540 --> 44:37.883
Jon's a great guy.

44:37.941 --> 44:40.182
He didn't look great when
he was puking this morning, saying that,

44:40.244 --> 44:42.349
- "This is the worst day of his life".
- How do you know about that?

44:42.413 --> 44:45.758
Because one of you morons posted it
on some video blog or something.

44:46.450 --> 44:48.691
- And you saw it?
- Yeah, we saw it, Phil.

44:48.752 --> 44:49.924
We all saw it.

44:51.221 --> 44:53.724
- Phil, what the fuck? Christ.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44:54.625 --> 44:55.933
You guys look really nice.

44:55.993 --> 44:57.631
I think the video is online
from this morning.

44:57.695 --> 45:00.141
She said they saw it.
Daphne said they saw it.

45:00.197 --> 45:02.517
- It's, like, him puking and stuff.
- How much did she see?

45:02.566 --> 45:04.045
I don't know.

45:04.101 --> 45:05.808
I don't know.

45:05.869 --> 45:07.314
Elissa is standing up there right now.

45:07.371 --> 45:10.318
I don't think she would be up there
if she saw that whole video.

45:16.246 --> 45:18.658
- Hey, remember what we talked about.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.923
- Jesus, keep your fucking mouth shut.
- Sorry.

45:23.220 --> 45:24.756
What was that about?

45:25.656 --> 45:26.657
Nothing.

45:28.058 --> 45:29.503
I know you're lying to me.

45:31.161 --> 45:33.072
Yeah, I know you're lying to me.

45:33.130 --> 45:35.130
Such a fucking bad liar,
I know you're lying to me.

45:35.132 --> 45:36.133
No.

45:37.901 --> 45:40.021
- What's going on? What's going on?
- Nothing, Daphne.

45:40.104 --> 45:42.675
- Honey, what the fuck is going on, Phil?
- Nothing, Daphne.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.811
- What the fuck is going on?
- You're being a cunt!

45:45.409 --> 45:46.752
You've been a cunt.
You're being a cunt!

45:46.810 --> 45:48.312
Everybody thinks you're a cunt.

45:48.378 --> 45:49.880
You're being a cunt right now!

45:58.989 --> 46:00.434
- We're screwed.
- She's gonna find out.

46:00.491 --> 46:01.595
We gotta do something,
she's gonna find out.

46:01.658 --> 46:02.659
She already broke him.

46:02.726 --> 46:05.138
Daph, I'm sorry.

46:07.998 --> 46:10.103
Yes, yes. Gracias.

46:13.937 --> 46:15.575
This will knock her right on her ass.

46:16.406 --> 46:18.818
- I'm sorry.
- Guys, don't wanna get dehydrated.

46:46.170 --> 46:48.013
Just ignore me, guys. Just gonna...

46:49.339 --> 46:51.114
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

46:51.175 --> 46:53.416
- I know you're lying to me.
- Just leave me alone.

46:53.877 --> 46:55.413
- I know something...
- Stop being a cunt.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.390
If you don't tell me,
I'm gonna fucking divorce you,

46:57.447 --> 46:58.721
I swear to God.

46:58.782 --> 47:00.455
Jon got a blow job last night.

47:02.786 --> 47:03.787
Fuck.

47:08.158 --> 47:09.193
What the fuck is wrong with you?

47:09.259 --> 47:10.795
Get over there and tell her something.

47:10.861 --> 47:12.204
- Okay.
- Go.

47:13.063 --> 47:14.064
Shit.

47:14.431 --> 47:16.536
You can't say anything to anyone.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.273
Don't say anything, I'll talk to him.

47:28.078 --> 47:29.523
Friends and family.

47:29.580 --> 47:31.890
We are here today
to celebrate the union

47:31.949 --> 47:33.792
of Jon and Elissa in marriage.

47:34.351 --> 47:35.762
We will begin the ceremony

47:35.819 --> 47:38.959
with a reading
from the bride's older sister, Daphne.

47:46.463 --> 47:48.841
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

47:48.899 --> 47:49.900
Daph...

47:51.635 --> 47:52.909
Watch her head. Watch her head.

47:53.937 --> 47:55.041
Is she all right?

47:55.572 --> 47:56.846
- Is she all right?
- Oh, God.

47:57.641 --> 47:59.052
- She's gonna be okay.
- All right.

47:59.843 --> 48:01.686
I got her. I got her.

48:03.146 --> 48:05.251
I've seen this a thousand times,
she's gonna be fine.

48:05.315 --> 48:08.728
Dehydration, mild hypovolemia, guys.
That's it.

48:08.785 --> 48:11.197
Phil, two to three quarts of liquids,
pump some electrolytes in there.

48:11.255 --> 48:14.327
She's gonna be dancing in no time
with everybody else.

48:14.391 --> 48:15.995
Come on, enjoy this.

48:16.360 --> 48:17.805
Oh, God.

48:21.565 --> 48:25.035
Jon and Elissa will now
read each other their vows.

48:28.505 --> 48:32.009
I, Jonathan Peter Carr,

48:32.075 --> 48:36.251
take you, Elissa Gabrielle Bloom,
to be my wife.

48:37.714 --> 48:39.990
To have and to hold
from this day forward...

48:51.795 --> 48:52.796
Sorry.

49:04.808 --> 49:06.185
Until death do us pad.

49:09.012 --> 49:13.154
I, Elissa Gabrielle Bloom...

49:28.966 --> 49:30.343
Watch the step.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.001
I can't believe
you guys drugged my wife.

49:32.002 --> 49:33.845
Well, you told your wife a secret, Phil.

49:33.904 --> 49:35.281
Fucking moron.

49:35.339 --> 49:36.647
Why are you filming this, Linc?

49:36.707 --> 49:38.209
You said, "Film everything."

49:38.275 --> 49:39.276
Turn it off!

49:39.343 --> 49:41.289
- Not gonna happen.
- Come on, come on, come on.

49:41.345 --> 49:43.382
Let's go. Let's put her down, Phil.

49:43.447 --> 49:44.653
- Come on.
- Sorry, baby.

49:44.715 --> 49:46.092
- Let's go.
- She's gonna be fine.

49:46.149 --> 49:48.527
I gave her a pill. Wears off in an hour.

49:49.586 --> 49:50.587
What're you doing?

49:50.654 --> 49:52.600
What do you mean, "What am I doing".
I'm locking her in there.

49:52.656 --> 49:53.760
Why are you locking her
in the bathroom?

49:53.824 --> 49:55.235
You know why I'm locking her in there?

49:55.292 --> 49:57.169
'Cause this shit was supposed to be
in the Bank of Phil.

49:57.227 --> 49:58.604
So think about that.

49:59.363 --> 50:02.242
- It was in the Banco de Phil.
- It was in the Banco de Phil?

50:02.299 --> 50:03.869
What, did some fucking bandits
come in?

50:05.802 --> 50:06.837
Come on.

50:06.903 --> 50:08.314
I have to talk to you.

50:09.773 --> 50:11.309
- What?
- Fuck, fuck.

50:12.242 --> 50:16.384
Last night was really crazy
and I got really drunk and...

50:16.446 --> 50:17.720
Jon, I know.

50:19.082 --> 50:20.356
What do you mean?

50:21.485 --> 50:23.556
I mean, I saw the video.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.497
You saw the video?

50:25.555 --> 50:27.091
No, the video?

50:27.758 --> 50:28.759
Yeah.

50:29.559 --> 50:30.697
Fuck.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.266
It's okay.

50:34.331 --> 50:35.571
It wasn't that bad.

50:35.632 --> 50:37.873
I don't want to look back
at our wedding weekend

50:37.934 --> 50:43.350
and always remember
how you got wasted, and you know...

50:44.274 --> 50:46.083
You serious?

50:46.143 --> 50:48.714
I don't know, because
it didn't seem that important.

50:48.779 --> 50:50.156
Really?

50:50.614 --> 50:52.321
That's how I feel.

50:52.382 --> 50:53.554
- That's how I feel.
- I love you.

50:53.617 --> 50:55.778
- I love you. I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

50:57.287 --> 50:58.891
God, thank you.

50:58.955 --> 51:01.663
- Thank you, you're the best.
- I am so happy.

51:01.725 --> 51:03.432
- We just got married!
- We're married.

51:03.493 --> 51:05.632
We're, like, freaking married. It's...

51:08.031 --> 51:09.510
I love you.

51:09.566 --> 51:13.275
Okay, I am gonna go and get wasted.

51:13.336 --> 51:14.474
Okay, whatever you say.

51:14.538 --> 51:15.539
- Not you though.
- Okay.

51:15.605 --> 51:16.948
You have to watch me inside.

51:17.007 --> 51:18.213
I will. I will.

51:31.621 --> 51:33.100
- Love you.
- All right, that's it.

51:47.838 --> 51:49.078
- Cal?
- Everything good?

51:49.139 --> 51:50.859
Yeah, everything's fine,
we took care of it.

51:50.941 --> 51:53.945
Dude, she knows about the blow job
and she doesn't care.

51:54.010 --> 51:55.045
- What?
- She said it's okay.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.217
I know, I just married the coolest
fucking woman in the universe.

51:57.280 --> 51:58.588
- Wait, are you fucking serious?
- Yeah.

51:58.648 --> 52:00.321
Round of blow jobs, please.

53:00.510 --> 53:03.889
Wish you all the happiness
and the best,

53:03.947 --> 53:06.553
'cause now you're on your own.

53:06.616 --> 53:07.890
Okay-

53:07.951 --> 53:09.225
Hear, hear.

53:14.157 --> 53:16.103
Mr. and Mrs. Bloom, everybody.

53:16.159 --> 53:19.163
And it was senior year,
senior in high school,

53:19.229 --> 53:23.541
my parents had just gone through
a very long overdue divorce.

53:23.600 --> 53:27.309
I was supposed to move to Connecticut
and leave the home that I grew up in,

53:27.370 --> 53:29.509
and the friends that I made and Jon.

53:29.573 --> 53:33.521
And I think
it really made us both really sad.

53:33.577 --> 53:35.250
And I remember, Jon came over

53:35.312 --> 53:37.349
and we were packing up
everything that I grew up with,

53:37.414 --> 53:38.654
all my possessions,

53:38.715 --> 53:41.719
and instead of packing the boxes
into the moving van,

53:41.785 --> 53:43.628
Jon packed 'em
into the back of his truck.

53:43.687 --> 53:45.860
And we drove to his house,

53:45.922 --> 53:49.267
where I lived for the next six months
and got to finish high school.

53:49.326 --> 53:50.805
And I don't even think
he told his parents.

53:50.860 --> 53:52.999
I think you guys were as surprised
as anyone

53:53.063 --> 53:54.542
when I showed up at your door.

53:54.598 --> 53:58.136
But you welcomed me
and for that I am so thankful.

53:58.201 --> 54:01.011
And now, as we welcome you guys
into your new family,

54:01.071 --> 54:04.484
I just hope that
I'm lucky enough to participate.

54:04.541 --> 54:06.646
'Cause I wanna be crazy Uncle Linc.

54:07.410 --> 54:09.151
But not in a creepy way.

54:36.339 --> 54:38.148
She's saying you had sex
with her husband last night.

54:38.208 --> 54:39.619
No, I didn't, that's ridiculous.

54:45.081 --> 54:46.583
She said she saw you guys last night,

54:46.650 --> 54:49.331
that her husband got home
at 6:00 in the morning, smelling like sex.

54:52.155 --> 54:55.034
Okay, okay, I fucked him.

54:55.091 --> 54:56.764
Okay? But I didn't know he was married.

54:56.826 --> 54:58.601
- Wait, you fucked him?
- Holy shit.

55:03.233 --> 55:06.009
He's saying that
you forced yourself upon him.

55:06.069 --> 55:07.605
That's bullshit, he begged me for it.

55:07.671 --> 55:09.810
Also, he said he was single
and his wife is dead.

55:15.178 --> 55:17.988
I'm not doing this right now.
Just take this outside, okay?

55:19.215 --> 55:20.717
Okay, enough.

55:22.252 --> 55:23.754
Okay, okay.

55:24.054 --> 55:25.795
I don't know what you people think...

55:28.558 --> 55:29.866
Oh, my God!

55:31.027 --> 55:33.234
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

55:33.296 --> 55:35.367
Oh, my God. I am so...
I didn't mean to do that.

55:35.432 --> 55:37.434
I didn't think that was gonna happen.
Cal...

55:37.500 --> 55:38.774
I am so sorry.

55:39.836 --> 55:41.372
I am so sorry.

55:41.438 --> 55:43.611
I'm so sorry.

55:43.673 --> 55:45.448
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

55:45.508 --> 55:47.613
I saw her having shots
with Elissa's mom.

55:48.144 --> 55:49.885
I can't believe that just happened
in front of everyone.

55:49.946 --> 55:52.085
I can't believe I just punched
that poor woman in the face.

55:52.148 --> 55:54.059
Thank you for having my back.

55:54.117 --> 55:56.495
I honestly thought
she might have hurt you.

55:56.553 --> 55:59.124
- I mean, she looked fierce.
- Fierce?

55:59.189 --> 56:01.328
Shit. I wasn't here, okay?

56:02.726 --> 56:03.932
Have you seen Linc?

56:03.993 --> 56:06.030
- No.
- I'm gonna kill that guy.

56:06.096 --> 56:07.097
Linc?

56:07.530 --> 56:08.838
Hey.

56:09.499 --> 56:10.773
It's Phil.

56:13.136 --> 56:14.240
Just wanted to talk.

56:15.138 --> 56:18.210
Ivan's a jerk, okay! Ivan's a jerkwad,

56:18.274 --> 56:19.548
number one.

56:19.609 --> 56:23.284
Jon, you know, he fucked up.

56:23.346 --> 56:26.020
Why is it my fault?
I didn't suck his dick, man.

56:26.082 --> 56:29.928
I'm just gonna check on her real quick,
just to make sure she's okay.

56:34.290 --> 56:35.928
Thank God.

56:35.992 --> 56:37.733
I'm so sorry.

56:37.794 --> 56:39.364
- Hi.
- Where am I?

56:39.429 --> 56:40.772
You're in the bathroom.

56:40.830 --> 56:41.865
Just...

56:41.931 --> 56:43.672
Just stay there, though.

56:45.869 --> 56:47.041
Please!

56:47.103 --> 56:48.776
- Open the door, Phil!
- Daph...

56:50.173 --> 56:51.846
Really, you fucked that guy?

56:51.908 --> 56:53.114
Here we go.

56:53.176 --> 56:55.417
Baby, I'm just saying,
how could you possibly fuck that guy

56:55.478 --> 56:57.082
when you got this
standing right in front of you?

56:57.147 --> 56:59.855
Cal, every time we're together,
I can pretty much guarantee

56:59.916 --> 57:01.418
you're gonna try to make this happen.

57:01.484 --> 57:04.431
It's 'cause we got
some crazy chemistry going.

57:04.487 --> 57:06.160
I know you feel that, right?

57:06.222 --> 57:08.998
Come on, this is like animal magnetism
that happens every...

57:09.058 --> 57:11.231
Okay, okay, fine.

57:12.796 --> 57:14.366
Fine, like, you'll think about it?

57:14.431 --> 57:16.308
Fine, like, you've worn me down,
so let's do this.

57:16.366 --> 57:18.039
My casita, 10 minutes.

57:20.870 --> 57:23.111
All right, it needs to go behind.

57:25.675 --> 57:27.985
- You think I was fucking born yesterday?
- What are you talking about?

57:28.044 --> 57:30.684
Tammy just told me
to go up to her casita.

57:31.114 --> 57:32.855
She wants to fuck.

57:32.916 --> 57:34.054
Really?

57:34.117 --> 57:37.155
Well, then you should go up
to her casita and fuck her.

57:37.220 --> 57:39.291
- That's awesome.
- Ivan, I'm not fucking with you right now.

57:39.355 --> 57:41.562
- This is not a joke.
- We don't do stuff like this anymore.

57:41.624 --> 57:43.831
I'm a married man, dude,
I mean, that's in the past.

57:43.893 --> 57:45.201
- Fuck.
- We're couple of dudes.

57:45.261 --> 57:48.003
What the fuck am I thinking?
Of course, she wants to fuck me.

57:48.064 --> 57:50.544
- Fucking tap that ass.
- Congratulations.

57:51.601 --> 57:53.342
Nicaragua, baby!

57:53.403 --> 57:55.781
It's amazing to me that he's gonna go
have sex with Tammy.

57:55.839 --> 57:59.150
Also, it's crazy that I am getting married

57:59.209 --> 58:00.847
after you guys

58:00.910 --> 58:05.689
put a fucking ring
in my girlfriend's sundae

58:05.748 --> 58:07.386
without me even knowing about it.

58:07.450 --> 58:08.690
What?

58:10.487 --> 58:12.057
What did you just say?

58:14.324 --> 58:16.326
- No, no.
- It was a prank?

58:17.927 --> 58:20.999
- No, it wasn't a prank.
- It was a fucking prank.

58:21.064 --> 58:23.374
- No, it started...
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

58:23.433 --> 58:25.470
It started off as a prank, Sarah. But it...

58:25.535 --> 58:26.946
Are you fucking kidding me, Ivan?

58:27.003 --> 58:29.074
- I'm not kidding you anything.
- Stop the bullshit.

58:29.138 --> 58:30.344
Stop your fucking bullshit.

58:30.406 --> 58:32.886
You fucking got engaged to me
on a prank.

58:32.942 --> 58:35.149
People can't be pushed to do something
they don't really wanna do.

58:35.211 --> 58:37.054
What's wrong with you? Shut up, Ivan.
Shut the fuck up.

58:37.113 --> 58:38.683
And I thought
for once in your fucking life,

58:38.748 --> 58:41.627
that you were making a decision
based on something that was real.

58:41.684 --> 58:43.095
But instead, you were just going along

58:43.152 --> 58:44.597
with whatever the fuck
was in front of you,

58:44.654 --> 58:45.860
like you always do.

58:45.922 --> 58:49.233
You're a fucking shitty, stupid,
fucking coward.

58:49.292 --> 58:51.431
And you're not funny,
you have terrible jokes!

58:51.494 --> 58:53.804
And I can't get this fucking ring off!

58:53.863 --> 58:55.308
And I don't want to be
with you anymore, okay?

58:55.365 --> 58:56.366
You cannot end this.

58:56.432 --> 58:58.309
- I don't wanna be with you anymore.
- I don't want this to end.

58:58.368 --> 59:00.143
And when I see you again,
don't fucking talk to me.

59:00.203 --> 59:02.706
This is yours, you keep it.
Why would I have this?

59:07.076 --> 59:09.852
I found a camera, too, Phil!

59:09.913 --> 59:13.952
And I am here to tell everyone out there

59:14.017 --> 59:16.964
that my husband locked me
in the bathroom like a psycho.

59:17.020 --> 59:20.399
Well, I'm gonna tell everyone
that you were gonna ruin the wedding.

59:20.456 --> 59:21.935
- No...
- So, I didn't really have a choice.

59:21.991 --> 59:25.131
Phil, let me out of here,
or I swear to God...

59:25.194 --> 59:26.229
You listen to me, okay?

59:26.296 --> 59:28.071
Jon's a nice guy.

59:28.131 --> 59:31.510
And he got a blow job on accident,
that happens.

59:31.568 --> 59:34.674
He cannot get erect by accident,
it's called cheating.

59:34.737 --> 59:37.911
It's called a mistake, you banshee
of a woman! She's a banshee.

59:37.974 --> 59:40.284
Goddamn it, Phil,
you're being a fuck face!

59:40.343 --> 59:42.584
You're the fuck face,
if you think about it!

59:43.046 --> 59:44.286
Now, open it!

59:44.347 --> 59:45.485
- Baby!
- What?

59:45.548 --> 59:47.653
You're gonna break my rig
that I have out here.

59:48.818 --> 59:50.559
I know you've been faking it, Phil.

59:51.321 --> 59:52.857
- What?
- Your orgasms?

59:52.922 --> 59:54.959
Yeah, I know you've been faking it.

59:55.024 --> 59:56.332
What kind of husband does that?

59:56.392 --> 59:58.432
He fakes an orgasm.
He can't even fuck his own wife.

59:58.494 --> 01:00:01.475
You're a fucking pussy, Phil. You're...

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.704
Don't call me a pussy.
Don't talk to me like that.

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:06.438
<i>I'm</i> a <i>man, okay? I'm</i> a <i>real man.</i>

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:09.642
I've got penis.
I've got testicles, all right?

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:11.151
Get on the bed!

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:17.517
Get on the bed.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.684
Get up.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.824
- Is this what you want?
- Yeah.

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:27.424
- You want Phil?
- Yeah.

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.163
- You want Phil?
- Phil...

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:30.863
I'm holding you, stay down there.

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.770
- You feel that passion?
- Yeah.

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:34.706
You feel the heat?

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:36.334
What's up, sports fans?

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.777
As ya'll can tell,
I'm a little tied up right now.

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.178
But guess who's on top of me?

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.692
So you really wanna know
what it's like to fuck Tammy?

01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:45.811
Are you kidding me, baby?

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.877
I've wanted to fuck you since college.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:50.119
Did I say you could
put your mouth on me?

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:52.056
That's not okay. Did I say that?

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:54.527
You little... You little
dirty little bitch.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.490
You like it rough.

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:57.929
Is that too rough?

01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:59.091
Goddamn!

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:00.293
Shut up.

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.094
Stay down.

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:06.970
Linc, dude, what the fuck?

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.977
Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:11.068
Hey, bro!

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.273
Looks like the best man won, right?

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.906
Wait, Linc!

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:16.041
Get back in here!

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.311
Is this the surprise?

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:19.182
- You got it, baby.
- What surprise?

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.053
You'll see.

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.189
No, no, no.

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.021
No, Linc, you are not watching, dude.

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:27.425
Sorry, bro, I'm not into that shit.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.928
He's not watching.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.131
Hell, yes!

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.997
Wait.

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:36.833
- Get over here, baby.
- Wait, wait, hey, hey, hey.

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:39.032
Hey, dude, come on.
Hey, put your pants back on.

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:41.905
What the fuck is going on right now?

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:43.866
Linc.

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.935
- You're such a <i>cool</i> dude.
- Oh, my God.

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:47.948
I think you're such a <i>cool</i> dude.

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:49.005
Oh, my God.

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:52.944
Dude, stop looking at me.

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:54.249
- Bros!
- No, we're not bros.

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:55.510
- We're bros!
- We're not bros.

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:58.458
- You're fucking bros!
- We're fucking bros!

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.926
You like it? You like it?

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:03.293
- Stop touching me.
- I'm close, I'm close.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.456
Yeah!

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.357
- It's so pretty.
- These candles are amazing.

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.663
- We're married.
- Really?

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:11.967
We're married.

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:13.234
I'm making a movie.

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:15.899
- I'm excited.
- Yeah?

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.911
Oh, my God.

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:22.514
Get on the bed.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.483
Come here. I've a surprise for you, baby.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.486
- You have a surprise?
- Yeah.

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:27.748
What is this?

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:34.488
Shit. I forgot.

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.620
What is that?

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.792
Are you okay?

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:39.491
It's a...

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:40.932
It's a bite mark.

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:44.964
A bite mark?
Why is there a bite mark on your dick?

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:46.432
I'm really sorry.

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:47.531
Oh, my God.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:50.942
You just thought
that you could just get away with that?

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:56.112
Get out of here.

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:26.462
I know that was unexpected
but it was also beautiful.

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:29.271
And I'm just gonna say it.
That was pretty intimate, man.

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:30.572
Linc.

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:32.306
Why are you so upset?

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:35.281
You said you wanted to
bang Tammy for years.

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:36.612
Not like that, bro.

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:39.948
What happened to
new experiences, bro?

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:43.183
You know, there was a moment
when we were both thrusting,

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.725
I felt your tip, man.

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:47.322
We touched tips.

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:32.364
- Hey, baby, we're rolling.
- Yeah?

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.669
We missed the wedding.

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.038
I don't really care.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:37.133
I don't care either.

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:38.405
I know you don't care.

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:45.014
It's Nicaragua, sf?

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:49.053
Please tell me
your wedding is gonna be this nuts.

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.419
There is no wedding.

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:52.516
Phil, we're not getting married.
I fucked it up. It's done.

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.618
What? Get it together, maybe.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.288
Take a page out of the book of Phil.

01:05:56.352 --> 01:05:57.632
If you know what's good for you.

01:05:57.653 --> 01:06:00.361
Stand up straight,
fasten your big-boy pants,

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:02.061
you go over there and you get her back.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:07.271
- Tam-Tam, what's going on, girl?
- Not much.

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:09.469
How you doin'? Where is everyone?
Where's Jon?

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:13.002
I don't know. I just spent the last hour
looking for Elissa.

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:15.379
After last night, they could be anywhere.

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:16.542
What does that mean?

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:17.640
Ivan, I can't do this right now.

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:19.948
I don't want to have this conversation.
I just wanna get home.

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:21.010
- Sarah.
- Just go.

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:25.423
When I watched you look down and see
that fake two-dollar ring in that sundae,

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:26.789
something happened to me.

01:06:26.849 --> 01:06:29.090
I wanna believe you so bad.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:35.166
See, that's what I'm saying to you.
It was all real. All of it.

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:36.794
I love you. I wanna marry you, Sarah.

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:54.787
Wait, wait, wait, I'm so sorry.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.482
How could you get that drunk?

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.417
I don't know. I don't know. I...

01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:03.024
I was with those guys again and...

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.198
I don't know.

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:06.892
Look, I made a terrible mistake.

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:09.664
But it's not me anymore, okay?
It's not me.

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:11.966
That's who I used to be
before I met you.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:14.065
Before I tamed you, right.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:17.210
The crazy guy. The Seabiscuit.

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:20.008
He meets a sweet, great,
down-to-earth girl

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:21.844
who just changes him into a better man.

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.247
Wait, baby, baby, wait.
You didn't change me.

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:24.841
I changed myself
because I fell in love with you.

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:26.944
I wanted to be a better person.

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:31.052
You made me so happy
that I wanted to change.

01:07:31.113 --> 01:07:34.117
I'm sorry. I need you.

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:36.424
I can't be myself without you.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.908
This is so beautiful.

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.910
That was breathtaking, to witness that.

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.912
Jon just ran down there and...

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:29.046
Laid it all on the line, you know,

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.278
and Lissy had some things to say.

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:34.218
They worked it out.

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:37.781
They're gonna be fine.

01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:39.724
Everybody's gonna be happy.

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:44.087
I'm really happy and they're having sex.

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.468
I should probably leave them to the...

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.599
Lovemaking.

01:08:56.064 --> 01:08:57.510
Yeah, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.278
Phil, where were you?

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.171
We're good.

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:03.774
They're having sex on the beach.

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:06.551
- Really?
- And it's gonna be hot

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:07.644
- 'cause I've taped it.
- Okay.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.246
Phil, that's not appropriate.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:10.915
Babe, not for the main cut, okay.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:14.426
But maybe like an unrated,
kind of like, you know, version.

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:17.157
Well, I know another good scene
for the unrated version.

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:19.062
You should ask Cal about it.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.533
Because you guys...

01:09:23.024 --> 01:09:24.026
Cal!

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:26.764
Cal! Cal, Cal.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.103
Tell me some stories. What's goin' on?

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:29.524
What happened? How was your night?

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:30.703
I've got no stories.

01:09:30.765 --> 01:09:32.301
Bullroar.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.109
Come on, lay it on me. You're Cal.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.649
What I...
I heard there was some sex with Tam?

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.009
Phil, I don't wanna talk about it.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.453
You okay?

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:46.621
Cal?

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:48.952
Did you get raped?

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:52.055
I tell you what. We get back to LA,
we can have another threesome.

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:54.965
And this time we can have
a really hot girl.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.163
- Tammy, stop playing games.
- No, I swear to God.

01:09:58.394 --> 01:09:59.600
That'd be nice.

01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:02.040
- Hey, you two. Everything cool?
- We're okay.

01:10:02.097 --> 01:10:03.838
- So?
- We're fine.

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:04.968
Don't do that anymore.

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.206
- Don't do that.
- Yeah.

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:07.338
Don't do... No fighting.

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:08.473
- Thank you.
- All right.

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:10.946
Did you just get laid?

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:14.548
Girl, yeah!

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:17.284
So, who actually did it? Who blew Jon?

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:18.848
Nobody knows. I mean...

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:21.394
Guess what happens in Nicaragua
stays in Nicaragua.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.952
That's Las Vegas, though.

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:25.259
But we can't use that in the movie.
That's copyrighted.

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:28.326
Yes.

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:30.126
- Bye.
- Bye, I love you, man.

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:32.872
- Okay, guys, come on.
- I don't wanna say goodbye to you.

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:36.067
Bye!

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.721
That's a cut.

01:10:55.784 --> 01:10:56.785
That's a...

01:10:56.852 --> 01:10:58.086
- Wrap.
- It's a wrap.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.769
- What's up, guys? Come on in.
- How are you, Phil?

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:08.706
- Okay, guys, I'm gonna be right back.
- All right.

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:10.444
Oh, my God.
Are these the "save the dates"?

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.003
These are amazing.

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.239
This is incredible.

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:15.248
We're doing it, guys.
Life is pretty good right now.

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.079
- That's not funny.
- I'm just sayin', dude.

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:19.210
- My tip misses your tip.
- Linc.

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:22.186
Guys, a week ago

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:24.884
I got a little package in the mail
from Nicaragua.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.585
I think it's the BJ tape.

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:27.821
Oh, my God.

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.920
I haven't even watched it yet.
I was saving it for you guys.

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:32.261
I just made us some popcorn.
Daph's not here.

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:33.561
- Yes, do it!
- Let's do it.

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.328
Thank you.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.631
And if you don't mind,

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:39.604
grabbing some reactions
while we watch it.

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:40.732
I think that'd be pretty.

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:42.639
You want us to film each other
while we watch this video?

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:44.371
Yeah, man, outtakes. It'll be hilarious.

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:46.379
- You all know it was Linc's chick?
- No, it wasn't.

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.880
She was just a girl I met in Mexico.

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:50.382
Come on, that woman
has shark teeth in her mouth.

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:53.443
Guys, Linc, come on.

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:54.886
- There we are.
- Guys...

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:56.786
Maggie and her sleeping prey.

01:11:56.845 --> 01:12:00.224
- She's gonna do it.
- Open wide, Mag, and go fast.

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:01.584
You know you're going to.

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:04.920
It's a goat.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:06.864
Oh, my God. What's that goat doing?

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.162
Come on, goat, do it.

01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:09.896
I buy it. Goats are docile creatures.

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.460
- Maggie's makin' a comeback here.
- Bullshit.

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.666
That's goat's gonna suck that dick.
Suck that dick, goat.

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.208
Yeah, suck that dick, goat.

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:16.598
- Wait, what happened?
- What?

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:17.666
What is that?

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:18.939
I think someone's blocking the camera.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:21.003
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.071
Who are you?

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:23.480
That's the woman
you punched in the face.

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:25.883
- What? You punched that hefty gal?
- Yeah.

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:28.142
- She's gonna do it, man.
- No way. It was Linc's chick.

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:30.248
No, no, watch, watch, watch.
Big fun's coming.

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:33.156
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my...

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:35.126
- Got it.
- Oh, my God.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.562
- Open that big mouth!
- Oh, my God.

01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:39.588
<i>Phil.</i>

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:40.725
Wait, is that Daphne?

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.802
- What?
- Wait, what?

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:43.859
<i>I can't keep doing this, Phil.</i>

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:44.927
What's she doing in Jon's room?

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:47.200
<i>I need a man that can get hard.</i>

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:49.936
No, I mean, we fixed that.
This whole information.

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:51.375
<i>I can make people come.</i>

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:52.554
God, what is wrong with her?

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.046
She's tripping balls.

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:56.709
I did give her the Mexican Ambien
for her night terrors.

01:12:57.873 --> 01:13:00.149
<i>I bet Jon can come.</i>

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.155
<i>I bet I can make Jon come.</i>

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.884
- What?
- God, please don't blow him.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:06.792
No, no, no.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.251
Holy shit.

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:11.056
Fuck. What the fuck?

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.827
- That's coming out.
- I <i>don't</i> feel good.

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:21.037
Phil, bro,
that wasn't even a blow job, man.

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:22.097
Seriously, she just bit him.

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:24.110
That was the exact medical procedure
that you would follow

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.886
if Jon had gotten a snake bite
on his penis.

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:30.246
- You okay, Phil?
- Hey, guys.

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:32.049
- Daphne.
- Phil showed you the wedding video?

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:34.519
- Yes, he did.
- My gosh. It's so good, right?

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:36.783
- Tour de force.
- Yeah.

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:37.915
It's so outrageous.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.015
I can't believe
some of the things you did.

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:40.082
It was wild.

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:41.992
- It got a little out of control.
- Yeah.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.290
You guys should be
a little embarrassed.

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:45.161
- Yeah.
- It was humiliating, man.

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.464
Baby, you okay?

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:48.797
You're not talking a lot.

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.165
- Why don't we take off?
- Yeah.

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:52.000
- Hey, enjoy your night.
- Here you go.

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:53.871
- Holy shit.
- That was fucked up.

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.306
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:57.468
Guys...

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:58.876
Everything cool, babe?

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:01.007
- What's he gonna do?
- I don't know. Look at him.

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:03.413
- Jesus Christ.
- He looks fucking pissed.

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:04.678
He's furious.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.377
- No.
- Holy shit.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.185
You've been a naughty girl, Daph.

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:14.127
Seems you've been bad. You know?

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:15.821
I've been a bad girl.

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:18.325
- Dude, he's channeling his rage.
- What?

01:14:18.387 --> 01:14:19.388
- Yeah.
- Look at him.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.526
- That is pretty fucking Phil.
- Yeah.
