WEBVTT

00:00.534 --> 00:03.737
[music playing]

00:08.276 --> 00:10.478
So Fred and I were talking,
and we decided this year

00:10.511 --> 00:12.213
for Halloween instead
of candy, we're going

00:12.246 --> 00:13.581
to give out carrot sticks.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.782
Yeah, we're going healthy too.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.918
We're giving out
filtered cigarettes.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.387
Hey, Rose.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.488
Trick or Treat, honey.

00:20.521 --> 00:24.225
No, she don't turn
tricks at work no more.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.759
I'll get your lunches.

00:25.793 --> 00:28.396
Well, if it's noon
and it's 40 pounds,

00:28.429 --> 00:30.898
it must be the city garage boys.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.266
Hello, Fred.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.667
Leon.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.902
Your fries will
be out in a minute.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.505
You know, I don't know
how you eat like this

00:37.538 --> 00:41.475
and still maintain that body.

00:41.509 --> 00:45.279
[chuckling].

00:45.313 --> 00:46.180
Just lucky, I guess.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.648
Right, honey?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.117
I have to say
she's the lucky one.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.823
Well, remember ladies, we close
at 2 tomorrow, so I can prepare

00:55.856 --> 00:58.259
for my Halloween soiree.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.461
You might want to use that
time to work on your costumes

01:00.494 --> 01:02.930
because this is
not going to be one

01:02.963 --> 01:05.399
of your lame little
lodge parties.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.668
Hey, our lodge
parties were not lame.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.170
The cops had to come every year.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.874
Please, Roseanne,
everyone knows

01:13.907 --> 01:16.009
that Halloween is our holiday.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.545
I can't believe
the breeders are

01:17.578 --> 01:18.846
trying to take back Halloween.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.614
Yeah.

01:20.648 --> 01:21.682
Oh, please.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.485
I was doing Halloween
since before there

01:24.518 --> 01:27.121
even were any gay people.

01:27.155 --> 01:33.194
Roseanne, Leon is
the Queen of Halloween.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.129
You wish.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.664
I'm the Queen of
Halloween, and I'm

01:36.697 --> 01:39.167
not about to give up my crown
to any Mary Come Lately.

01:43.171 --> 01:46.440
Well, I certainly hope
that you can make the party.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.808
I don't think so.

01:47.841 --> 01:51.245
I'm really not much for parties,
and besides, I have a thing.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.280
Well, that's perfect.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.381
They're looking for
guys with things.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.986
Hey, don't worry big guy.

01:59.019 --> 02:01.121
We don't bite.

02:01.155 --> 02:04.525
Hard as it is not to sometimes.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.660
You know Leon, I'm
not coming to the party.

02:06.694 --> 02:10.598
And if I did come, I'd come
with my wife, who I sleep with,

02:10.631 --> 02:11.765
and I have sex with.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.868
Lots of sex, the
old fashioned way.

02:14.902 --> 02:18.406
So just give me some space.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.240
Yes, sir.

02:31.752 --> 02:36.156
Me thinks young Fred
doth protest too much.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.191
What's he mean?

02:37.225 --> 02:38.792
Well, you know what
they say about guys

02:38.826 --> 02:40.928
who whine about gay men?

02:40.961 --> 02:42.530
No, what do they say?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.732
The squeaky wheel
wants to get greased.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.137
Ooooh!

02:50.170 --> 02:52.206
Ghosts, goblins, and ghouls!

02:52.240 --> 02:53.106
Spooky!

02:53.140 --> 02:55.576
Spooky!

02:55.609 --> 02:58.546
Mom, shouldn't you be
home, drinking alone?

03:01.715 --> 03:04.485
FYI Nancy's fixing
me a take out.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.355
And you're not the only
prankster afoot this year.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.190
I've cooked up a little scheme
for each of my daughters.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.960
So boogie, boogie, boogie.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.228
I hope you're
not going to fake

03:14.262 --> 03:15.429
your death again this year.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.898
God, that was such
a disappointment.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.701
Why, Roseanne, I see you're
already getting into costume.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.204
You've got a big patch
of gray, right there.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.172
Oh, I get it.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.007
Yeah, my hair is gray.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.542
My refrigerator's running.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.244
I have Prince Albert in a can.

03:30.278 --> 03:33.180
God, will it never
cease with you, mother?

03:33.213 --> 03:34.181
Oh, piffle.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.684
That gray hair
certainly isn't my work.

03:36.717 --> 03:42.189
My little trick on you will
put the O in Halloween.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.492
Here you go Bev, we
ran out of napkins,

03:44.525 --> 03:46.960
so I threw in a couple
extra buns for you.

03:46.994 --> 03:51.198
If I'm going to eat all this,
I certainly don't have room

03:51.231 --> 03:52.866
for this can of peanut brittle.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.235
Jackie used to be so fond of it.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.570
Have some--

03:56.604 --> 03:59.540
Hey, Mom, and we got you
your favorite macadamia nuts.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.411
Macadamia nuts, they are,
you know, my absolute favorite.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.845
Yummy, yummy yum--

04:04.878 --> 04:05.779
(SCREAMING) Oh, snakes!

04:05.813 --> 04:06.614
Oh!

04:10.083 --> 04:14.355
Fine, you've ruined
an old woman's prank.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.557
I hope you're happy.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.559
[crying] Why must
you torment me?

04:18.592 --> 04:19.393
Why?

04:23.431 --> 04:24.932
Well, Mom's crying.

04:24.965 --> 04:29.102
Halloween has officially begun.

04:29.136 --> 04:32.506
[theme music]

05:20.187 --> 05:21.822
I can't believe you let
Mom talk you into coming

05:21.855 --> 05:23.391
to her old biddy salon.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.224
Look at these women.

05:27.395 --> 05:30.130
You know, they say your hair
keeps growing after you die.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.166
And apparently, it's true.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.502
Hey, Jackie.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.403
Kyle!

05:35.436 --> 05:36.236
Hi!

05:39.339 --> 05:40.541
Good to see you, girlfriend.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.809
Good to see you.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.749
Is that your old boyfriend?

05:48.782 --> 05:50.451
No, it's a buddy of Fred's.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.586
I think they play
softball together.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.487
Oh, really?

05:53.521 --> 05:55.122
Was Fred pitching or catching?

05:58.125 --> 05:59.693
You know, Leon is wrong.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.695
Fred does not have a
problem with gay people.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.564
He's been friends
with Kyle for years.

06:03.597 --> 06:07.134
KYLE: Doll, those
streaks are to die!

06:07.167 --> 06:08.235
Well.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.737
Maybe he just didn't
know that he was gay.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.574
Hi, I'm Antonio.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.543
How much color are
we talking today?

06:15.576 --> 06:16.844
Well, not a lot.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.847
I just want to go back to
my natural color, Hawaiian.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.487
Boy, you really do have
a lot of gray up there.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.321
Our mother went
gray very suddenly.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.590
Oh, really?

06:29.623 --> 06:31.291
Well, yeah, that was the
day she found my underwear

06:31.324 --> 06:33.393
in the glove compartment.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.096
No, what I meant is, hair
is hereditary on the mother's

06:36.129 --> 06:38.331
side, so whatever
happened to your mom

06:38.365 --> 06:40.934
is probably going
to happen to you.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.002
Oh, great.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.871
I'm going to find a
Buffalo Head Nickel

06:43.904 --> 06:47.541
and talk about it for 25 years.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.676
Oh, look at these.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.744
I guess there's worse
things than going gray.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.180
That looks just like mom's hair.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.616
Roseanne, that is
exactly like Mom's hair.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.786
Same exact color,
same exact style.

06:58.819 --> 07:02.355
Roseanne, that is Mom's hair.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.591
Our mom wears a wig.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.158
You think she's bald?

07:05.192 --> 07:06.359
No way.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.962
If she's bald, that means
that we could go bald.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.831
This is her hair.

07:10.864 --> 07:14.635
Look at, look at, look at this.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.569
(MOTHER'S VOICE) Oh, Roseanne.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.408
(MOTHER'S VOICE) A
woman of your size

07:21.441 --> 07:23.376
shouldn't wear
horizontal stripes.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.446
You should wear
black or stay home.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.749
And another thing, dear,
I don't mean to alarm you,

07:28.782 --> 07:30.718
but I think your little
DJ might be retarded.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.324
[upbeat music playing]

07:39.827 --> 07:42.295
Hey, Mark, how come
everybody's talking

07:42.329 --> 07:44.197
about Leon's Halloween
party like it's

07:44.231 --> 07:45.232
going to be so different?

07:45.265 --> 07:47.234
What's the big deal?

07:47.267 --> 07:49.102
Well, see they're going
to be a lot of people there

07:49.136 --> 07:50.437
that are, you know--

07:53.373 --> 07:55.375
DJ, get out of here now.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.343
Wait a minute.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.377
Mark, that's terrible.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.846
Why don't you just
tell him the truth?

07:58.879 --> 08:01.582
Because I can't
tell him about that.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.416
Hey, any guy who's
comfortable with himself

08:03.450 --> 08:04.785
doesn't have a problem
talking about this.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.287
DJ sit down.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.623
What Mark meant to tell you,
is that Leon's party is going

08:09.657 --> 08:11.725
to be different because there's
going to be a lot of gay people

08:11.759 --> 08:12.626
there.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.161
Oh.

08:14.194 --> 08:14.995
What does gay mean?

08:24.104 --> 08:26.574
Well, that's a
fine question, DJ.

08:29.543 --> 08:34.414
Uh, see, sometimes
boys have boyfriends,

08:34.447 --> 08:37.751
and sometimes girls
have girlfriends,

08:37.785 --> 08:40.453
and these people are called gay.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.255
Well, I have boys
who are friends.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.423
What's the difference?

08:46.326 --> 08:56.203
All right, um, see
boys who have boyfriends,

08:56.236 --> 09:00.507
do things with their
friends that a boy who

09:00.540 --> 09:02.976
has a friend who just
happens to be a boy

09:03.010 --> 09:04.044
would probably never do.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.751
I don't understand.

09:10.784 --> 09:11.919
[clears throat]
Yeah, me neither.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.386
Oh!

09:13.420 --> 09:24.865
Um, uh, see when two
men love each other,

09:24.898 --> 09:28.501
they, like everybody
else, they like

09:28.535 --> 09:35.008
to share each other's
feelings for one another

09:35.042 --> 09:44.952
through beautiful expressions
of uh, physical love.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.019
How they do that?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.358
Hey, if a guy's
comfortable with himself,

09:51.391 --> 09:53.260
he isn't afraid to talk
about this, you fruit.

09:55.663 --> 09:56.463
Uh.

09:59.232 --> 10:13.681
See, one guy will, uh,
uh, he and the other guy,

10:13.714 --> 10:22.155
they, uh, see what
they do is, uh, Oh,

10:22.189 --> 10:23.824
god, I don't know what they do!

10:23.857 --> 10:24.692
Leave me alone, DJ.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.030
That was great!

10:30.063 --> 10:32.800
I thought he was
gonna start crying.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.267
Let's go down to the arcade.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.669
We can listen to it
again on the way.

10:35.703 --> 10:39.639
[tape recorder rewinding]

10:39.673 --> 10:44.611
[upbeat music playing]

10:44.644 --> 10:48.081
[jazzy music playing]

10:48.115 --> 10:49.582
Hey, how's it going?

10:49.616 --> 10:51.051
Hey, how ya doing?

10:51.084 --> 10:52.552
Good to see ya.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.420
Hey, how ya doing, bud?

10:56.724 --> 10:58.625
Roseanne, I think these
guys are checking me out.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.928
No one can tell we're a couple.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.395
Our costumes should
have had a theme.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.296
They do.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.033
I'm Prince, and you're the Duke.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.236
Hey, there's Mom.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.571
Look, I told you that,
that hair cannot be real.

11:11.604 --> 11:12.806
Look at that.

11:12.840 --> 11:17.210
Even William Shatner would
make fun of that piece.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.347
Come on, Roseanne, it's the
same hair she's always had.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.015
Well, that is
precisely my point.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.084
I mean, her face looks
like a dried up old apple,

11:24.117 --> 11:26.754
and she's got the same
hairdo for 20 years.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.722
Go over there and start talking
to her and distract her,

11:28.756 --> 11:30.057
so I can get in there
for a closer look.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.125
Oh, don't make me talk to her.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.795
How about if I just
knock her unconscious

11:34.828 --> 11:37.130
and you rip her off?

11:37.164 --> 11:40.801
Yoohoo, Roseanne!

11:40.834 --> 11:44.738
Forget about going bald, worry
about inheriting that voice.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.440
What do you think
of my hobo costume?

11:47.474 --> 11:48.876
Well, I think it's great.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.078
But, um, you should let me
straighten up your hair,

11:51.111 --> 11:52.612
cause it's kind of messy.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.547
It's supposed to be messy.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.515
I'm a vagabond.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.152
I ride the rails
and live by my wits.

11:59.186 --> 12:02.222
I know, but let me straighten
it, cause it's tilted.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.057
I do not need your help.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.834
Well.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.837
Well, your party
is in full swish.

12:16.870 --> 12:20.440
(CHUCKLING) Let's
see, all in purple.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.242
Let me guess.

12:22.275 --> 12:26.413
You're either one of the
California Raisins or Barney?

12:29.682 --> 12:31.084
And I know who you are.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.352
You're Becky's gym teacher.

12:35.022 --> 12:38.491
No, I think you know who I am.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.661
Many in Washington feel
I have too much power

12:41.694 --> 12:44.965
and I control the president.

12:44.998 --> 12:48.535
I always wear sensible,
but feminine dresses.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.402
J Edgar Hoover?

12:54.341 --> 12:57.510
No, I'm Hillary
Rodham Clinton.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.213
Hoover would never wear taupe.
He was an autumn.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.930
Holy rented costumes, Batman!

13:16.964 --> 13:18.465
It's the only way I
could get him to come.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.201
He thinks that a superhero
costume makes him look macho.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.104
Fred, stop hiding
behind the cape.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.841
I don't want these guys
checking out my utility belt.

13:27.875 --> 13:28.808
Hey, Fred.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.878
Hey, how ya doing?

13:30.911 --> 13:31.778
Can we go now?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.381
No, we're having fun.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.315
[sighs]

13:35.348 --> 13:36.884
How's it going, Fred?

13:36.917 --> 13:37.717
Hey, Dave.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.092
Excuse me.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.335
That's a great
costume, uh, Dave is it?

13:55.368 --> 13:56.236
Uh-huh.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.371
How long have you known Fred?

13:58.405 --> 14:00.273
Well, I used to know him
before he stopped coming

14:00.307 --> 14:03.510
to the bars and everything.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.413
Are you trying to tell
me that Fred is gay?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.448
[chuckling] Honey,
I can't believe

14:08.481 --> 14:09.416
he's trying to be straight.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.255
[music playing]

14:15.288 --> 14:17.690
[upbeat music playing]

14:17.724 --> 14:18.992
Have you seen Fred?

14:19.026 --> 14:20.760
Um, no.

14:20.793 --> 14:23.196
I-- I have to find Dan.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.398
DAN: The old squad out of
this crab style [inaudible]..

14:25.432 --> 14:26.599
Bop!
Bop!

14:26.633 --> 14:28.568
Dan, Dan, Dan, I got to
you alone in the kitchen,

14:28.601 --> 14:29.836
right now.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.404
(JOHN WAYNE VOICE WAYNE
VOICE) Well, Sure little lady.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.806
This cowpoke wouldn't mind
a little ride on the range.

14:40.780 --> 14:41.581
Oh.

14:45.185 --> 14:48.321
Dan, Fred is gay.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.656
What?

14:49.689 --> 14:51.824
I was just talking
to this Diana Ross guy,

14:51.858 --> 14:54.561
and he said the
Fred used to be gay.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.595
Fred?

14:55.628 --> 14:58.365
Fred's not gay.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.499
Fred is gay, OK?

14:59.532 --> 15:00.400
He's the gayest.

15:00.433 --> 15:04.504
He's gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.639
I get it.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.341
Well, ole Danny
Boy is not falling

15:08.375 --> 15:10.643
for the ole Fred is gay prank.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.979
You did a lot
better when you got

15:12.012 --> 15:14.881
that doctor to tell your mom
she only had a week to live.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.986
Dan, that is not my prank
because this is my prank.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.992
Wow, good prank, Roseanne.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.693
Mrs. Connor, can
I get down now?

15:26.726 --> 15:30.097
I can't feel my toes.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.598
Shut up!

15:31.631 --> 15:33.033
Now, do you believe me?

15:36.636 --> 15:38.171
First of all, I
don't believe you.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.807
Second of all, it's
none of your business.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.043
Jackie has to know, Dan.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.078
I mean, you can go stick your
head in the sand all you want,

15:45.112 --> 15:47.247
but I would not do it
around Fred if I was you.

15:54.054 --> 15:57.824
[upbeat music playing]

15:57.857 --> 16:00.593
Um, hey, Leon,
where's Jackie and Fred?

16:00.627 --> 16:03.296
Fred ran out, and
Jackie ran after him.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.566
I think the Caped Crusader
was afraid of being unmasked.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.801
Oh, Leon, put a sock in it.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.003
Don't need to.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.743
[upbeat music playing]

16:18.311 --> 16:19.212
[knocking on door]

16:19.246 --> 16:22.115
Yeah?

16:22.149 --> 16:23.750
What are you doing here?

16:23.783 --> 16:27.620
Um, well I heard that you
and Fred ran out of the party,

16:27.654 --> 16:30.323
and so I was just
kind of worried and--

16:30.357 --> 16:31.624
Are you guys OK?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.060
Yeah, he went straight to bed.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.195
I don't-- something
upset him at the party.

16:35.228 --> 16:38.065
Well, I, uh, want to ask
your advice about something.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.934
Um, at the party tonight,
you know, there was this guy,

16:41.968 --> 16:47.607
you know, and um, I, um, found
out that he's really gay.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.544
I mean, he's a nice guy,
see, but he's married,

16:51.578 --> 16:54.481
and I don't think he's
told his wife the truth.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.015
Oh, wow.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.985
Yeah, so do you think
I should tell her?

16:59.018 --> 16:59.886
Well, I don't know.

16:59.919 --> 17:00.787
That's a hard one.

17:00.820 --> 17:01.754
No, I wouldn't.

17:01.788 --> 17:02.655
Well, I would.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.490
Fred is gay.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.495
What are you talking about?

17:08.528 --> 17:09.929
Just a lot of
guys at the party,

17:09.962 --> 17:12.199
they know Fred, like
you know him, you know?

17:12.232 --> 17:14.801
I mean, a different side of him.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.403
That's ridiculous!

17:16.436 --> 17:20.006
Please, there's no way
that Fred could be gay.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.875
I mean, there are certain
things that a wife

17:22.909 --> 17:24.311
knows about her husband.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.446
OK, just think about
it for a minute, Jackie.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.781
Haven't you ever noticed
anything a little odd

17:28.815 --> 17:29.682
about Fred?

17:29.716 --> 17:31.784
No, like what?

17:31.818 --> 17:36.156
Like when he came back from
Chicago with that hair cut?

17:36.189 --> 17:39.359
Fred likes to try new
things with his hair,

17:39.392 --> 17:41.861
only with his hair.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.330
Well, you know he's
only slept with three

17:43.363 --> 17:44.731
women in his whole life, right?

17:44.764 --> 17:46.533
So that leaves a
lot of free nights,

17:46.566 --> 17:49.169
and you know that he's always
admiring your boyish figure.

17:49.202 --> 17:52.172
That doesn't prove
anything, Roseanne.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.307
Didn't he take
you to see That's

17:54.341 --> 17:55.775
Entertainment Part Three?

18:05.718 --> 18:06.986
Oh my god!

18:18.598 --> 18:19.466
Go away!

18:19.499 --> 18:20.467
Go away!

18:20.500 --> 18:21.468
Leave us alone.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.403
We are as god made us.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.409
[cheering]

18:29.442 --> 18:30.910
We're everywhere, Roseanne.

18:30.943 --> 18:35.348
DAN: OK, I propose a toast to
the all-time greatest prank

18:35.382 --> 18:36.916
in the history of the universe.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.652
Roseanne, come on!

18:39.686 --> 18:41.554
Come on back!

18:41.588 --> 18:43.022
Think we went too far?

18:43.055 --> 18:44.123
I don't know.

18:44.157 --> 18:47.727
Dan, do you think we
should have worn Pants?

18:47.760 --> 18:49.829
Not now, Fred, we'll talk
about it in the shower.

18:49.862 --> 18:53.065
Roseanne, come on, don't be mad!

18:53.099 --> 18:54.334
It was just a joke.

18:54.367 --> 18:57.370
Great pictorial for
the employee newsletter.

19:04.944 --> 19:08.348
[upbeat music playing]

19:12.452 --> 19:14.354
Hey, Dan, if
you're still gay, I

19:14.387 --> 19:18.658
could go for a mimosa
and some Eggs Florentine.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.926
I don't cook for you.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.928
I'm Fred's bitch.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.497
Admit it,
Roseanne, we got you.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.233
You were totally freaked.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.035
You know, the really amazing
thing was not that Dan was gay,

19:29.068 --> 19:32.305
but that he would be
attracted to Fred.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.475
I have a bone to
pick with you, Missy.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.677
You know, Mom, no one
writes letters anymore,

19:37.710 --> 19:41.681
and I think you're just the
person to revive that lost art.

19:41.714 --> 19:45.785
I understand that you
went to my beauty parlor

19:45.818 --> 19:50.790
yesterday and asked
Antonio about my hair!

19:50.823 --> 19:52.959
You went back there?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.026
Oh, chill out, Mom.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.395
He didn't tell me anything.

19:55.428 --> 19:58.798
You've got the only hairdresser
in town that doesn't dish.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.634
How could you do
something like that?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.936
I mean, it's one
thing to embarrass

20:03.970 --> 20:08.341
me in front of my family, but
in front of my hairdresser?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.109
Honey, don't you
have any decency?

20:10.142 --> 20:11.678
How dare you!

20:11.711 --> 20:13.079
Well, Mom, it's no big deal.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.647
I was just curious.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.116
Do you really
want to know what's

20:17.149 --> 20:19.319
going on under this hair?

20:19.352 --> 20:20.587
You want the truth?

20:20.620 --> 20:22.922
- Well, yeah.
- Fine.

20:22.955 --> 20:27.159
Face your future, Roseanne.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.661
Ahhhhh!

20:28.695 --> 20:31.163
[crying]

20:31.197 --> 20:33.666
Ahhhhh!

20:33.700 --> 20:39.138
[crying]

20:39.171 --> 20:41.207
Don't feel bad, Roseanne.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.208
You won't be bald alone.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.678
MOTHER: [crying]

20:45.712 --> 20:47.614
I'm with ya too, Sis.

20:47.647 --> 20:51.451
MOTHER: [laughing]

20:59.826 --> 21:03.730
God, Mom, I didn't know
that you had that in you.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.766
Admit it, Roseanne, you're
not the cleverest trickster

21:06.799 --> 21:07.900
in this family anymore.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.404
[laughing]

21:11.438 --> 21:17.544
Well, I guess you guys showed
me this Halloween, didn't ya?

21:17.577 --> 21:20.947
Seven bald people in my kitchen.

21:20.980 --> 21:21.848
I'm just so ashamed.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.751
I have nothing to top that with.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.153
Oh, except for--

21:41.668 --> 21:43.636
[music playing]

21:55.147 --> 21:57.917
[music playing]
