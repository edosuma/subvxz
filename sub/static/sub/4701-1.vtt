For those who haven't,
uh, read the plaque,

01:06.959 --> 01:08.617
we'll read the plaque.

01:08.719 --> 01:11.337
"Here men
from the planet Earth

01:11.439 --> 01:13.740
first set foot
upon the moon

01:13.839 --> 01:15.757
July 1969.

01:16.559 --> 01:19.079
We came in peace
for all mankind."

02:26.255 --> 02:28.557
<i>~ It's the end</i>
<i>of the world ~</i>

02:28.655 --> 02:30.149
<i>~ As we know it ~</i>

02:30.256 --> 02:33.038
<i>~ It's the end</i>

02:39.247 --> 02:41.484
<i>~ And I feel fine... ~~</i>

02:55.151 --> 02:57.191
If this isn't an insanely
beautiful woman,

02:57.295 --> 02:58.855
I'm hanging up.

02:58.959 --> 03:01.260
Sir, I... I... I think you
should listen to this.

03:06.159 --> 03:07.817
Aah! Aah.

03:09.039 --> 03:10.381
- God damn it!
- Sir?

03:10.479 --> 03:12.137
- Sir?
- Damn!

03:12.239 --> 03:14.062
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

03:14.159 --> 03:15.654
Come on, baby. Come on.

03:15.759 --> 03:16.706
This better not be

03:16.802 --> 03:18.213
another damn Russian
spy job.

03:18.319 --> 03:20.457
Boys from Air Traffic RES
say skies are clear.

03:20.559 --> 03:21.901
It's the real thing.

03:21.999 --> 03:24.682
A radio signal
from another world.

03:24.783 --> 03:26.212
Let... Let's not jump
the gun here.

03:26.319 --> 03:27.945
Get on-line
with Space Command.

03:28.047 --> 03:29.541
They're gonna want
to know about...

03:29.647 --> 03:31.174
Jeez, what's
with the golf balls?

03:31.279 --> 03:32.230
You're gonna
kill me here.

03:32.326 --> 03:33.896
Wait. wait.
This can't be right.

03:33.999 --> 03:36.006
The calculated
distance from source

03:36.111 --> 03:39.886
is only
375,000 kilometers.

03:41.839 --> 03:43.879
It's coming
from the moon.

03:56.847 --> 03:58.669
Who else knows
about this?

03:58.767 --> 04:00.775
S.E.T.I. in New Mexico
identified a signal,

04:00.879 --> 04:03.181
but, uh, they're
even more confused

04:03.279 --> 04:04.424
than we are, sir.

04:05.487 --> 04:06.446
Excuse me.

04:10.447 --> 04:11.394
Major?

04:11.490 --> 04:12.401
Yes, sir.

04:12.497 --> 04:14.342
Radar reception
has been impaired,

04:14.447 --> 04:16.748
but we were able
to get these.

04:16.846 --> 04:18.189
And we estimate

04:18.286 --> 04:21.069
that it has a diameter
of over 550 kilometers

04:21.166 --> 04:24.428
and a mass roughly
1/ 4 the size of our moon.

04:24.527 --> 04:26.120
What the hell is it?

04:26.223 --> 04:27.169
A meteor?

04:27.265 --> 04:28.176
No, sir.

04:28.272 --> 04:29.452
No.
Definitely not.

04:29.551 --> 04:30.827
How do you know?

04:30.927 --> 04:33.131
Well, sir, it's...
slowing down.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.508
It's what?

04:34.607 --> 04:36.679
It's, uh...
it's slowing down, sir.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.701
Get me the secretary
of defense.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.196
Then wake him!

04:53.103 --> 04:54.248
Hello.

04:54.351 --> 04:55.693
Hi. It's me.

04:55.791 --> 04:56.726
Hi.

04:56.822 --> 04:58.791
What time is it there?

04:58.895 --> 05:00.750
It's 2:45
in the morning.

05:00.847 --> 05:02.189
I know I didn't
wake you.

05:02.287 --> 05:04.589
As a matter of fact,
you did.

05:04.687 --> 05:05.646
Liar.

05:07.535 --> 05:09.357
I have a confession
to make.

05:09.455 --> 05:13.033
I'm sleeping next to
a beautiful young brunette.

05:13.135 --> 05:14.477
You didn't let her

05:14.575 --> 05:16.265
stay up all night
watching TV...

05:16.367 --> 05:17.314
did you?

05:17.409 --> 05:18.669
Of course not.

05:18.767 --> 05:21.068
You're gonna come home right
after the luncheon, right?

05:21.167 --> 05:22.345
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.394
Mommy?

05:23.490 --> 05:24.749
Here's your mother.

05:26.671 --> 05:27.980
Hi, honey.

05:28.079 --> 05:29.420
Hi. I miss you.

05:29.519 --> 05:30.474
I know.

05:30.569 --> 05:32.168
President Whitmore's
approval ratings

05:32.271 --> 05:34.093
have slipped
below 40%.

05:34.191 --> 05:36.013
Even his crime bill
failed to pass.

05:36.111 --> 05:39.526
Are the salad days over for
President Whitmore? Morton?

05:39.630 --> 05:42.086
Leadership as a pilot
in the Gulf War

05:42.191 --> 05:44.558
is completely different
from leadership in politics.

05:44.655 --> 05:46.267
Daddy let me watch
Letterman.

05:46.363 --> 05:47.322
Traitor.

05:48.239 --> 05:49.189
That's the problem.

05:49.285 --> 05:50.236
They elected a warrior,
and they got a wimp.

05:51.436 --> 05:52.745
Good morning,
George.

05:52.844 --> 05:54.186
Good morning,
Mr. President.

05:54.285 --> 05:56.107
That game couldn't
have been pretty.

05:56.205 --> 05:57.863
Ha ha.
Thank you, sir.

05:59.405 --> 06:02.023
Connie, you're up awfully
early this morning.

06:03.724 --> 06:05.699
They're not attacking
your policies.

06:05.805 --> 06:07.430
They're attacking
your age.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.834
"Whitmore seems
less like the president

06:09.932 --> 06:12.234
and more like
the orphan child Oliver

06:12.333 --> 06:15.529
asking, 'Please, sir,
I'd like some more.'"

06:15.628 --> 06:16.575
That's clever.

06:16.670 --> 06:18.082
Yeah, well,
I'm not laughing.

06:18.189 --> 06:19.301
Age was never an issue

06:19.405 --> 06:20.965
when you stuck
to your guns.

06:21.069 --> 06:22.629
You were thought of
as young, idealistic.

06:22.733 --> 06:25.515
Now the message
has gotten lost.

06:25.613 --> 06:28.395
It's just too much politics.
It's too much compromise.

06:28.493 --> 06:29.834
Isn't it amazing

06:29.932 --> 06:32.518
how quickly everyone
can turn against you?

06:36.204 --> 06:37.163
It's a fine line

06:37.260 --> 06:39.016
between standing
behind a principle

06:39.117 --> 06:40.905
and hiding behind one.

06:41.004 --> 06:42.826
You can tolerate
a little compromise

06:42.924 --> 06:44.102
if you're
actually managing

06:44.205 --> 06:46.114
to get something
accomplished.

06:46.220 --> 06:50.443
Well... the Orange County Dispatch
has voted you

06:50.540 --> 06:53.671
one of the 10 sexiest men...
of the year.

06:55.116 --> 06:56.327
That's...

06:58.892 --> 07:01.259
That's accomplishing
something.

07:01.356 --> 07:02.436
Excuse me, Mr. President.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.679
It's the secretary
of defense.

07:06.957 --> 07:07.916
Yes.

07:10.637 --> 07:12.873
Can you say that again?

07:42.394 --> 07:43.258
Station WXBY
out here in Brooklyn.

07:43.354 --> 07:44.625
Station WXBY
out here in Brooklyn.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.032
The temperature is
95 degrees in Central Park.

07:47.131 --> 07:48.473
What it is here
in the borough,

07:48.570 --> 07:49.517
God only knows.

07:49.613 --> 07:50.610
Let's go to NickJones.

07:50.715 --> 07:53.748
He'll give us a traffic
report to the beaches...

07:53.851 --> 07:55.509
So why are you
waiting? Hmm?

07:55.611 --> 07:57.585
My social security
will expire,

07:57.691 --> 07:59.513
you'll still
be sitting there.

07:59.611 --> 08:00.887
I'm thinking.

08:00.986 --> 08:02.328
Yeah, well,
think already.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.123
Dad, do you have any idea

08:11.227 --> 08:12.787
how long it takes for
those cups to decompose?

08:12.891 --> 08:14.167
If you don't move
soon,

08:14.267 --> 08:15.282
I'm gonna start
to decompose.

08:15.386 --> 08:16.321
OK.

08:16.417 --> 08:17.352
Ah. Ah.

08:21.050 --> 08:22.065
Listen, David,

08:22.170 --> 08:24.887
I've been meaning
to talk with you.

08:24.986 --> 08:27.670
It's nice that you see
me so much now, but...

08:27.770 --> 08:28.981
Don't... Don't start, Dad.

08:29.082 --> 08:30.064
I'm only saying
it's been, what,

08:30.171 --> 08:31.381
four years?

08:31.483 --> 08:32.977
You're still wearing
your wedding band?

08:33.082 --> 08:34.033
Three years.

08:34.129 --> 08:36.212
All right, three, four.
You're divorced.

08:36.313 --> 08:37.875
Come on, move on.
This is not healthy.

08:37.977 --> 08:40.051
No, this is not healthy.
Smoking is not healthy.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.396
Checkmate.

08:45.498 --> 08:46.578
Wait a minute,
wait a minute,

08:46.683 --> 08:48.112
wait a minute.

08:48.219 --> 08:49.713
Wait, wait, wait.
This is not...

08:49.819 --> 08:50.833
This is not
checkmate.

08:50.939 --> 08:51.953
See you
tomorrow, Pop.

08:52.059 --> 08:54.514
Now, just hold on.
This is not checkmate.

08:56.859 --> 08:58.452
Ahh, checkmate.

08:58.555 --> 08:59.394
Yes, we've got
everybody we have

08:59.490 --> 09:00.098
Yes, we've got
everybody we have

09:00.194 --> 09:00.826
working on the problem.

09:00.922 --> 09:02.255
We are doing every...

09:02.363 --> 09:04.665
I love X-Files, too.
I hope you get to see it.

09:04.762 --> 09:06.257
Good morning.
Compact Cable.

09:06.362 --> 09:07.704
Anna will take care of you.
David. David.

09:07.803 --> 09:09.144
What the hell's the point
of having a beeper

09:09.242 --> 09:10.355
if you're not gonna
turn it on?

09:10.458 --> 09:12.116
It was turned on.
I was ignoring you.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.234
Hello.
What's the, uh...

09:13.338 --> 09:14.680
What's
the big emergency?

09:14.779 --> 09:16.120
It started this morning.

09:16.218 --> 09:18.040
Every station's making
like it's the 1950s.

09:18.138 --> 09:19.960
We got static.
We got snow.

09:20.058 --> 09:21.236
All kinds
of distortions.

09:21.338 --> 09:22.516
- Nobody knows...
- Marty...

09:22.619 --> 09:23.601
What the hell
are you doing?

09:23.706 --> 09:24.657
There's a reason

09:24.753 --> 09:25.714
we have bins
labeled "recycle."

09:25.818 --> 09:27.160
What the hell
is going on?

09:27.259 --> 09:28.205
My God in heaven.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.001
So sue me. David!
We got a problem.

09:31.099 --> 09:33.400
Did you try to switch
transponder channels?

09:33.498 --> 09:35.320
Oh, please.
You think I'd be this panicked

09:35.418 --> 09:36.760
if it was something simple?

09:36.859 --> 09:39.062
OK. Let's point the dish
at another satellite.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.780
We tried that.
It didn't work.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.053
It's almost as though
they weren't even there.

09:44.154 --> 09:46.740
All right. All right.
What've we got here?

09:51.323 --> 09:52.665
This is impossible.

09:52.762 --> 09:55.545
We created
a race of robots.

09:55.642 --> 09:56.589
Their function...

09:56.685 --> 09:58.512
Miguel, the signal's
all screwed up.

09:58.618 --> 10:00.145
Stop it.
Just leave it alone.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.811
You're gonna break it,
all right?

10:01.914 --> 10:03.060
It's so fuzzy.

10:10.074 --> 10:11.417
Oh, no.

10:16.379 --> 10:18.517
Good morning, Lucas.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.960
You see these?

10:20.059 --> 10:22.393
I got a whole god damn
crop full of these.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.313
If your father's
not in the air

10:24.411 --> 10:25.720
in 20 minutes...

10:25.819 --> 10:27.477
I'm getting
someone else.

10:34.394 --> 10:35.353
Hey!

10:36.122 --> 10:37.069
Russell!

10:37.165 --> 10:38.741
Hey, Miguel!

10:40.250 --> 10:42.138
Ha ha ha ha ha!

10:42.234 --> 10:43.769
Whoaaaa!

10:45.402 --> 10:46.937
Whooooo!

10:49.242 --> 10:51.413
Yahhhh-hoooo!

10:51.514 --> 10:53.783
Russell!
What are you doing?

10:53.882 --> 10:54.841
Whoo!

11:08.890 --> 11:11.126
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

11:11.226 --> 11:12.173
Whoa! Ohh!

11:12.269 --> 11:13.216
Oh!

11:15.066 --> 11:16.560
It's the wrong field,
you idiot.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.285
Lucas' farm is
on the other side of town.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.632
Are you sure?

12:01.146 --> 12:03.448
CNS is running a story
that we're covering up

12:03.547 --> 12:05.041
some type of nuclear
testing experiment.

12:05.146 --> 12:06.488
Tell them to run with it

12:06.587 --> 12:07.928
if they want to
embarrass themselves.

12:08.026 --> 12:09.848
NASA's been on my butt
all morning.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.288
They want to know
our position.

12:11.387 --> 12:12.728
Our official position is

12:12.826 --> 12:14.168
we have no official
position.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.089
Connie,
what is going on here?

12:16.187 --> 12:18.009
Come on, would I keep you
out of the loop?

12:18.107 --> 12:19.568
- Yes, absolutely.
- In a second.

12:19.674 --> 12:21.365
What? I can't hear you.

12:21.466 --> 12:22.710
At the moment,

12:22.810 --> 12:24.152
our satellites are
somewhat unreliable.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.209
Isn't it possible

12:25.306 --> 12:27.128
that this thing may
just pass us by?

12:27.226 --> 12:29.048
What if it doesn't
"pass us by"?

12:29.146 --> 12:31.699
Let's retarget some ICBMs
to blow it outta the sky.

12:31.802 --> 12:33.144
And risk turning one
dangerous falling object

12:33.242 --> 12:34.290
into many?

12:34.394 --> 12:35.341
We don't yet know
enough

12:35.437 --> 12:36.434
about what
we're dealing with

12:36.539 --> 12:38.361
to make any kind
of intelligent judgments.

12:38.459 --> 12:40.281
Luckily, the press is
making up their own story

12:40.379 --> 12:41.361
at this point.

12:41.466 --> 12:43.124
But that's not
gonna keep.

12:43.226 --> 12:45.528
We may need to upgrade
to Defcon Three.

12:45.626 --> 12:46.968
Absolutely.
General, contact NORAD.

12:47.066 --> 12:48.953
You tell them we've upgraded
to Defcon Three.

12:49.050 --> 12:51.090
That's not what
the president said.

12:51.195 --> 12:52.141
That's a little
premature.

12:52.237 --> 12:53.157
I don't think so.

12:53.253 --> 12:54.967
We have more than 50%
of the armed forces

12:55.066 --> 12:56.017
out on weekend leave,

12:56.113 --> 12:58.327
not to mention
the commanders and troops

12:58.427 --> 12:59.507
that are in town
for the 4th ofJuly parade.

12:59.610 --> 13:00.887
Go ahead, Commander.

13:00.986 --> 13:02.001
Our intelligence
tells us

13:02.107 --> 13:03.219
the object has settled
into a stationary orbit.

13:03.323 --> 13:04.664
Well, that's
good news.

13:04.762 --> 13:05.907
Uh, not really, sir.

13:06.010 --> 13:07.122
Part of it
has broken off

13:07.226 --> 13:08.262
into nearly three
dozen other pieces...

13:08.358 --> 13:09.317
smaller than
the whole, sir,

13:10.726 --> 13:13.792
yet over 15 miles
in width themselves.

13:17.446 --> 13:18.788
Where are
they heading?

13:18.887 --> 13:21.189
They should be entering
our atmosphere

13:21.286 --> 13:23.109
within
the next 25 minutes.

13:31.655 --> 13:33.694
Take us to Defcon Three.

13:40.711 --> 13:42.533
Please tell me we're
gettin' somewhere.

13:42.631 --> 13:44.224
Oh, there's good news,
and there's bad news.

13:44.326 --> 13:45.887
All right,
what's the bad news?

13:45.990 --> 13:47.452
The bad news is that
you're in meal penalty

13:47.558 --> 13:48.573
for disturbing my lunch.

13:48.678 --> 13:50.817
And the good news is
you're not gonna charge me.

13:50.919 --> 13:53.253
Uh, no. The good news is
that I've found the problem.

13:53.351 --> 13:54.693
It's not our equipment.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.700
There's some kinda weird signal
embedded in the satellite feed.

13:56.806 --> 13:57.757
And that's the good news?

13:57.853 --> 13:59.141
Yeah, 'cause this signal

13:59.238 --> 14:00.253
has a definite
sequential pattern,

14:00.359 --> 14:02.017
so as soon as I find
the exact binary sequence,

14:02.118 --> 14:03.941
then I can calculate
the phase reversal

14:04.038 --> 14:04.998
with that analyzer

14:05.094 --> 14:06.371
I built you for your
birthday and apply it,

14:06.471 --> 14:08.478
we should be able to
block it out completely.

14:08.582 --> 14:10.437
And then we'll be
the only guys in town

14:10.535 --> 14:11.844
with a clear picture?!

14:11.943 --> 14:13.285
Yes! Yes! Yes!

14:13.382 --> 14:14.548
Oh, David,
that's why I love you!

14:14.644 --> 14:15.591
I know.
That's unnecessary.

14:15.687 --> 14:16.609
Oh, yes! Yes!

14:16.705 --> 14:17.637
You're too kind.

14:45.797 --> 14:46.975
This better be good.

14:47.077 --> 14:48.255
Captain on deck!

14:51.046 --> 14:53.828
Sir, we're looking
at a total radar blackout

14:53.926 --> 14:55.268
over a 13 kilometer area.

14:55.365 --> 14:56.707
Let's do a diagnostic
check...

14:56.806 --> 14:57.820
Excuse me, sir.

14:57.925 --> 14:59.267
The radar may be
malfunctioning,

14:59.365 --> 15:00.325
but the infrared

15:00.421 --> 15:02.080
is totally
off the map.

15:05.894 --> 15:06.853
Jeez.

15:09.286 --> 15:11.326
Get me Atlantic Command
on the line.

15:14.565 --> 15:15.907
Hang on, sir.

15:16.006 --> 15:17.500
Sir, we have
visual range

15:17.605 --> 15:19.100
with incoming
over Iraqi airspace.

15:19.205 --> 15:20.285
Second sighting?

15:20.390 --> 15:23.423
Yes, sir. This just came in
from the Persian Gulf.

15:23.526 --> 15:24.573
Correction, sir.

15:24.677 --> 15:26.500
We now have two
confirmed visual contacts.

15:26.597 --> 15:27.808
That's affirmative.
Mr. President.

15:27.909 --> 15:30.211
They're tracking another one
off the California coastline.

15:31.269 --> 15:33.091
All right, go ahead.
Put it on.

15:33.189 --> 15:35.011
General, you might
want to watch this.

15:37.222 --> 15:38.563
Ladies and gentlemen...

15:38.661 --> 15:40.003
ladies and gentlemen,

15:40.102 --> 15:41.531
we are interrupting
our regular broadcast

15:41.637 --> 15:43.131
to bring you
extraordinary events

15:43.238 --> 15:45.147
taking place
in the Russian Republic.

15:45.254 --> 15:46.595
This unexplained disturbance

15:46.693 --> 15:47.806
and the hysteria
that it's causing

15:47.909 --> 15:48.956
are incredible.

15:49.061 --> 15:50.403
How
would you describe

15:50.502 --> 15:51.452
what you're seeing?

15:51.548 --> 15:53.315
It is clearing
the mountains...

15:53.413 --> 15:55.202
moving too slowly

15:55.302 --> 15:57.603
to be a comet
or meteor.

15:57.701 --> 16:00.996
Widespread panic has
gripped the countryside

16:01.093 --> 16:03.362
as thousands have
taken to the streets.

16:03.461 --> 16:04.803
It is confirmed.

16:04.901 --> 16:06.462
The unexplained
phenomenon

16:06.565 --> 16:07.907
is headed
for Moscow.

16:08.005 --> 16:08.952
Mr. President,

16:09.047 --> 16:10.307
we have an AWAC
off the West Coast.

16:10.405 --> 16:13.474
three minutes.

16:13.637 --> 16:15.460
I don't
understand it, sir.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.504
Side radar
doesn't see it.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.340
I know. It's blind, sir.

16:18.437 --> 16:19.779
Nothing is registering.

16:19.877 --> 16:22.179
Negative.
We have zero visibility.

16:22.277 --> 16:23.619
Visibility is at...
zero.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.888
Command, this is
Eagle Eye 370.

16:25.989 --> 16:28.771
Captain,
the president is listening.

16:28.869 --> 16:30.756
Repeat what
you just told me.

16:32.198 --> 16:34.653
We still have
zero visibility.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.339
Instrumentation
is malfunctioning.

16:39.397 --> 16:41.219
We can't get
any kind of reading

16:41.317 --> 16:42.430
of what's
in front of us.

16:42.533 --> 16:43.515
Wait a minute.

16:45.157 --> 16:46.684
May be clearing.

16:54.053 --> 16:55.515
Pull up! Pull up!

16:59.365 --> 17:00.324
- Aah!
- Aah!

17:05.957 --> 17:07.135
Line's gone, sir.

17:07.237 --> 17:09.059
Two more have been spotted
over the Atlantic.

17:09.156 --> 17:10.301
One's moving
toward New York,

17:10.405 --> 17:11.359
the other's
headed this direction.

17:11.455 --> 17:12.391
How much time
do we have?

17:12.487 --> 17:13.387
Less than 10 minutes.

17:13.482 --> 17:14.843
Alex, organize
a military escort.

17:14.949 --> 17:16.258
Mr. President,
I strongly recommend

17:16.358 --> 17:18.016
we move you to a secure
location immediately.

17:18.117 --> 17:19.426
Connie, can we expect

17:19.525 --> 17:21.314
the same kind of panic
we saw in Russia?

17:21.413 --> 17:22.460
More
than likely.

17:22.566 --> 17:24.867
We can discuss this
on the way.

17:24.964 --> 17:26.394
I'm not leaving.

17:26.501 --> 17:28.257
We have to maintain
a working government...

17:28.357 --> 17:30.179
I want you to get
the vice president,

17:30.277 --> 17:31.619
the whole cabinet,
and joint chiefs,

17:31.718 --> 17:33.627
and take them
to a secured location.

17:33.734 --> 17:34.684
I'm staying.

17:34.780 --> 17:36.700
I don't want to add
to a public hysteria

17:36.805 --> 17:38.780
that's gonna cost lives.

17:38.885 --> 17:39.832
Connie.

17:39.928 --> 17:40.873
Yes, sir?

17:40.969 --> 17:41.912
We'll initiate

17:42.008 --> 17:42.932
the Emergency
Broadcast System.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.061
We'll advise people
not to panic.

17:44.165 --> 17:45.987
The best idea
right now

17:46.085 --> 17:47.678
is to stay
in their homes.

17:47.782 --> 17:49.123
Yes, sir.
Roy. Dean.

17:49.221 --> 17:51.043
And, Alex, you contact
the cabinet members.

17:51.141 --> 17:52.096
Have them rendezvous here.

17:52.192 --> 17:53.245
We'll take them to NORAD.

17:53.349 --> 17:55.454
Mr. President,
with your permission,

17:55.557 --> 17:58.176
I'd like to remain
at your side.

17:59.237 --> 18:01.310
I had a feeling
you would.

18:03.717 --> 18:06.335
And what happens if they
do become hostile?

18:08.357 --> 18:10.495
Then God help us.

18:10.629 --> 18:12.930
There it is, the strange
atmospheric phenomenon.

18:13.029 --> 18:14.851
It is apparently
what has been causing

18:14.949 --> 18:16.378
all the distortions
in our broadcasts.

18:16.486 --> 18:17.980
David, are you
watching this?

18:19.653 --> 18:21.476
Not to react

18:21.573 --> 18:23.035
in a manner
of cold fear.

18:23.141 --> 18:24.483
We have no evidence

18:24.581 --> 18:26.883
that these phenomena
are endangering anyone.

18:26.981 --> 18:29.436
Thus far,
reports of aggression...

18:29.541 --> 18:30.883
Marty, listen to this.

18:30.982 --> 18:32.804
I got a lock on the pattern
of that signal,

18:32.902 --> 18:34.014
so we can filter it out.

18:34.118 --> 18:35.711
But if my calculations
are right,

18:35.813 --> 18:38.115
it's going to be gone in,
like, seven hours anyway.

18:38.213 --> 18:40.187
It's reducing itself
every time it recycles,

18:40.293 --> 18:42.529
so eventually
it's gonna disappear...

18:42.629 --> 18:43.579
You listening?

18:43.675 --> 18:45.181
Can you
believe this?

18:46.950 --> 18:49.153
David, haven't you
been watching?

18:49.253 --> 18:50.300
David!

18:50.405 --> 18:52.323
General.

18:52.453 --> 18:53.948
Good afternoon.

18:54.053 --> 18:56.770
So far, the phenomenon has
not caused any damage.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.105
We have to ask you
to try to stay calm,

18:59.205 --> 19:00.831
and it's important
for everyone not to panic.

19:00.933 --> 19:03.105
We have a fix on three
of the occurrences

19:03.205 --> 19:04.285
about to appear
over American cities.

19:04.389 --> 19:05.633
It's just unreal.

19:05.733 --> 19:07.075
Hey, Miguel,
come here.

19:07.173 --> 19:08.995
One is headed
towards Los Angeles.

19:09.093 --> 19:11.165
The other two are
on our eastern seaboard

19:11.269 --> 19:13.557
headed towards New York
and Washington, D.C.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.529
headed towards New York
and Washington, D.C.

19:14.625 --> 19:15.465
Marty.

19:15.561 --> 19:16.867
Marty.Jamie says

19:16.966 --> 19:18.788
this building has
an old bomb shelter.

19:18.886 --> 19:20.708
We're heading
down there now.

19:20.806 --> 19:23.555
All right. Um, everybody,
head down to the basement.

19:23.653 --> 19:25.147
Take it slow.
Don't run.

19:25.253 --> 19:26.911
Walk down
to the basement.

19:28.805 --> 19:30.627
There's no shame
in hiding.

19:30.725 --> 19:33.027
Oh, I better
call my mother.

19:41.861 --> 19:44.033
- Hoo hoo!
- Ha ha ha!

19:44.133 --> 19:46.751
Well, look who
we have here.

19:49.573 --> 19:50.915
Hey, Russ, I heard

19:51.013 --> 19:52.802
you had a little
trouble this morning.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.716
Dusted the wrong field.

19:55.813 --> 19:58.563
I know you're probably
still a little confused

19:58.661 --> 20:00.155
from your hostage
experience.

20:00.261 --> 20:01.208
Hostage experience?

20:01.304 --> 20:03.971
Did something happen
to you, Russ?

20:04.069 --> 20:05.792
Oh, yeah. Seems
years back,

20:05.893 --> 20:06.852
our boy was kidnapped
by aliens.

20:06.949 --> 20:08.771
Did all kinds
of experiments on him.

20:08.869 --> 20:10.691
Tell them about it,
Russ.

20:10.789 --> 20:12.065
Get a couple beers
in him,

20:12.165 --> 20:13.180
he'll tell you
all about it.

20:13.285 --> 20:15.140
Crazy stuff.
Won't you, Russ?

20:15.237 --> 20:16.192
Russ...

20:16.288 --> 20:18.432
when they took you
up in their spaceship,

20:18.533 --> 20:19.875
did they do any...

20:19.973 --> 20:21.795
sexual things,
do you recall?

20:21.893 --> 20:23.234
Do you recollect?

20:23.333 --> 20:25.059
Ha ha ha!

20:25.445 --> 20:27.550
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

20:27.653 --> 20:28.599
Oh, Russ!

20:28.695 --> 20:30.882
Ha ha ha ha ha!

20:40.997 --> 20:42.338
Let's get
outta here.

20:42.437 --> 20:44.892
What's going on?

20:51.141 --> 20:52.636
What's that?

20:52.741 --> 20:54.628
Let's get outta here.
Come on.

20:57.413 --> 20:58.395
Oh, wow.

20:59.461 --> 21:00.890
Oh, my God.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.033
Mommy! Lookit!

21:21.125 --> 21:22.084
Mmm...

21:23.621 --> 21:26.043
It's too early, baby.

21:31.493 --> 21:32.835
Is it a earthquake?

21:32.932 --> 21:35.234
Not even
a four pointer.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.675
Go back to sleep.

21:36.772 --> 21:37.787
Mmm...

21:52.165 --> 21:53.124
Daddy!

21:55.621 --> 21:57.660
What are you
doing here?

21:57.765 --> 21:59.587
You should be
down in the shelter.

21:59.685 --> 22:00.895
What's going on?

22:19.333 --> 22:21.634
Come on!
Pass it over here, man!

22:21.733 --> 22:23.075
Come on! Come on!

22:23.173 --> 22:24.132
Unh!

22:33.285 --> 22:34.267
Aren't you coming,
David?

22:34.372 --> 22:35.485
No. I gotta see this.

22:55.013 --> 22:56.355
That's cool, man!

23:35.716 --> 23:36.993
You jerk!

23:37.093 --> 23:38.052
Whoa!

23:58.821 --> 23:59.998
The signal.

24:01.701 --> 24:02.660
My God.

24:19.012 --> 24:21.314
Now what do we do?

24:21.413 --> 24:22.755
Address the nation.
There's gonna be

24:22.852 --> 24:26.431
a lot of frightened
people out there.

24:26.533 --> 24:27.492
Yeah.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.107
I'm one of them.

24:32.612 --> 24:34.074
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.482
He's just
trying to impress you.

24:36.581 --> 24:39.363
If you want to impress me,
you need to get a job

24:39.461 --> 24:41.697
and stop slobbering
all over my shoe.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.883
I don't believe this.
Jasmine.

24:58.980 --> 25:00.835
Neighbors moving out.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.650
Guess they finally got tired
of all these quakes.

25:05.860 --> 25:07.966
A little shake,
and they running.

25:08.069 --> 25:09.531
Police and
the fire departments

25:09.637 --> 25:12.671
are asking everyone
to stay off the phone.

25:12.772 --> 25:15.074
Baby, there's something
on the news about the quake.

25:15.173 --> 25:17.474
The police are asking
us not to call 911.

25:17.572 --> 25:18.620
What's up, man?

25:18.725 --> 25:20.252
What you been
doing out there?

25:20.356 --> 25:22.495
Shooting the aliens.

25:22.597 --> 25:23.644
Oh, you shooting aliens,
right?

25:23.748 --> 25:24.894
You think
you tough, huh?

25:24.997 --> 25:27.779
What you got? Turn around.
Let me see what you got.

25:27.877 --> 25:28.824
Come on, Boomer.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.836
Let's get you
something to eat.

25:29.931 --> 25:31.290
Mmm. Uh, nnnnn...
Oh, now, watch out.

25:31.397 --> 25:32.575
Watch it now, baby.

25:32.677 --> 25:34.084
I'll go grab
the paper.

25:34.181 --> 25:35.196
All right.

25:36.676 --> 25:37.635
Ow!

25:37.797 --> 25:38.756
Darn...

25:51.493 --> 25:52.769
Honey, let's go!

26:07.748 --> 26:10.683
Babe, you want
some of this coffee?

26:10.788 --> 26:11.747
Babe.

26:15.109 --> 26:16.353
Boom! Boom! Boom!

26:18.629 --> 26:20.451
Pentagon officials

26:20.549 --> 26:21.858
are reporting more ships
have just arrived

26:21.956 --> 26:23.298
over the capitals
of India,

26:23.397 --> 26:24.739
England, and Germany,

26:24.836 --> 26:27.619
bringing estimates up to
anywhere from 10 to 15

26:27.716 --> 26:29.953
of these city-sized
spacecraft.

26:30.053 --> 26:31.362
I know, Ma.

26:31.461 --> 26:32.737
Just try
and stay calm.

26:32.837 --> 26:34.659
Tell her to pack up
and leave town.

26:34.757 --> 26:36.066
Why? What happened?

26:36.165 --> 26:37.506
Just do it!

26:37.605 --> 26:38.947
Oh, Ma.
Ma, listen.

26:39.045 --> 26:41.500
Get your stuff together
and head for Aunt Esther's.

26:41.604 --> 26:43.579
Don't argue with me.
Just go!

26:43.684 --> 26:47.263
David, why did I just
send my mother to Atlanta?

26:47.364 --> 26:48.379
David.

26:48.484 --> 26:49.859
David, talk to me.

26:49.957 --> 26:51.266
Did you hear me tell you

26:51.364 --> 26:52.674
that the signal hidden
in the satellite feed

26:52.772 --> 26:54.114
is slowly recycling down
to extinction?

26:54.213 --> 26:55.152
Not really.

26:55.248 --> 26:56.450
It's a countdown.

26:56.549 --> 26:57.564
A countdown?

26:57.668 --> 27:00.123
Wait. A countdown
to what, David?

27:00.229 --> 27:01.887
Uh, it's like in chess:

27:01.989 --> 27:04.290
First you strategically
position your pieces,

27:04.388 --> 27:06.210
then, when
the timing's right,

27:06.308 --> 27:07.290
you strike.

27:07.397 --> 27:08.356
See?

27:08.805 --> 27:11.423
They're positioning themselves
all over the world

27:11.524 --> 27:14.208
using this one signal
to synchronize their efforts.

27:14.309 --> 27:15.650
In approximately six hours,

27:15.749 --> 27:16.699
the signal's going
to disappear,

27:16.795 --> 27:18.202
and the countdown's
going to be over.

27:18.309 --> 27:19.770
And then what?

27:21.989 --> 27:23.515
Checkmate.

27:25.637 --> 27:26.651
Oh, my God.

27:26.757 --> 27:27.902
Oh, my God!

27:28.005 --> 27:29.531
I've got to call
my brother.

27:29.637 --> 27:30.979
I'd better call
my housekeeper.

27:31.076 --> 27:32.418
I gotta call
my lawyer.

27:32.517 --> 27:33.859
Eh, forget
my lawyer.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.779
Ladies and gentlemen,

27:35.876 --> 27:37.665
the president
of the United States.

27:37.765 --> 27:38.942
Good afternoon.

27:39.045 --> 27:41.500
My fellow Americans,

27:41.605 --> 27:45.347
a historic and unprecedented
event has occurred.

27:45.445 --> 27:46.786
The question
of whether or not

27:46.884 --> 27:48.161
we're alone in the universe

27:48.260 --> 27:49.667
has been answered.

27:49.764 --> 27:51.106
Although
it's understandable

27:51.205 --> 27:54.303
that many of us feel a sense
of hesitation or even fear,

27:54.405 --> 27:56.772
we must attempt
to reserve judgment...

27:56.869 --> 27:59.651
He says
he's your husband.

27:59.749 --> 28:01.283
Oh, God.

28:04.389 --> 28:05.501
What do you want?

28:05.605 --> 28:07.514
You got to leave
the White House.

28:07.621 --> 28:09.028
This is hardly
the time nor the place

28:09.124 --> 28:10.368
to be having that
same old discussion!

28:10.469 --> 28:11.428
You don't understand.

28:11.525 --> 28:12.475
You got to leave
Washington.

28:12.571 --> 28:14.622
Well, in case you
haven't noticed,

28:14.724 --> 28:16.066
we are having
a little crisis here.

28:16.165 --> 28:17.506
They're communicating
with a hidden signal.

28:17.604 --> 28:18.782
They're going to attack.

28:18.885 --> 28:20.128
You are just
being paranoid!

28:20.228 --> 28:21.187
Shh!

28:21.348 --> 28:22.777
It's not paranoia.
The embedding's very subtle.

28:22.885 --> 28:24.062
It's probably
been overlooked. If...

28:31.685 --> 28:33.310
Marty, what
are you doing?

28:33.412 --> 28:34.721
Get out of town
as soon as you can.

28:34.821 --> 28:36.348
- Please.
- OK, OK.

28:36.452 --> 28:37.630
My staff and I will
remain in the White House

28:37.733 --> 28:39.391
as we attempt
to establish communication.

28:40.581 --> 28:43.363
If you feel compelled
to leave these cities,

28:43.461 --> 28:45.533
please do so
in an orderly fashion.

28:50.660 --> 28:52.002
Hey! What's
going on?

28:53.188 --> 28:54.135
Excuse me.

28:54.231 --> 28:55.178
Coming through.

28:56.805 --> 28:58.212
The arrival
of the alien visitors

28:58.309 --> 29:00.131
has caused over 10,000
fender-benders

29:00.229 --> 29:01.473
in just
a few seconds' time,

29:01.572 --> 29:03.001
but this is just
the beginning...

29:03.109 --> 29:04.309
Uh-uh. Come on, now,
you can't go.

29:04.404 --> 29:05.323
Uh-uh. Come on, now,
you can't go.

29:05.419 --> 29:06.272
You got to call them back.

29:06.368 --> 29:08.896
I'm not going to do this
with you, Jasmine.

29:08.996 --> 29:10.458
I've got to report
to El Toro.

29:10.564 --> 29:12.419
But you said you was
on leave for the 4th.

29:12.517 --> 29:13.727
Yeah, well,
they canceled it!

29:16.037 --> 29:18.076
Look, why are you
acting like this?

29:18.180 --> 29:19.139
Why?

29:23.236 --> 29:24.251
That's why.

29:33.444 --> 29:34.622
Look...

29:34.724 --> 29:36.219
I really don't think

29:36.324 --> 29:37.950
they flew 90 billion
light years

29:38.052 --> 29:39.427
to come down here
and start a fight

29:39.524 --> 29:41.859
and get all rowdy.

29:41.957 --> 29:44.323
Look, why don't you
just relax?

29:44.420 --> 29:46.176
I'm going to report
to El Toro

29:46.276 --> 29:48.032
and find out
what's going on.

29:51.365 --> 29:52.510
What are you doing
in there, man?

29:52.612 --> 29:53.954
Nothing.
I'm just driving.

29:55.780 --> 29:56.795
Honk honk!

29:56.900 --> 29:58.395
Look. Here,
I got these for you.

29:58.500 --> 29:59.515
Firecrackers.

29:59.620 --> 30:00.798
Now, you be careful.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.851
Steve, wait.

30:01.947 --> 30:03.354
I want to tell you
something.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.053
What is it, Jasmine?

30:08.100 --> 30:10.402
You take care
of yourself, you hear?

30:13.029 --> 30:14.851
Look, um...

30:14.949 --> 30:17.087
why don't you get
some things packed,

30:17.189 --> 30:19.131
and you and Dylan come stay
with me on the base.

30:21.092 --> 30:22.685
And you will see that

30:22.789 --> 30:23.966
there is nothing
to be scared of.

30:24.068 --> 30:25.181
Really?

30:26.469 --> 30:27.810
You don't mind?

30:27.908 --> 30:29.250
Well, I mean, uh...

30:29.349 --> 30:32.480
We'll have to let all
my other girlfriends know

30:32.580 --> 30:34.107
that they can't
come over, you know,

30:34.213 --> 30:36.035
and got to postpone
a little freaky-deaky.

30:36.133 --> 30:37.474
There you go.

30:37.572 --> 30:38.914
There he goes,
thinking you all that.

30:39.013 --> 30:40.354
But you are not

30:40.452 --> 30:42.241
as charming as you
think you are, sir.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.250
Yes, I am.

30:44.357 --> 30:46.560
Them big ol' Dumbo ears.

30:46.660 --> 30:48.700
Well, look at you
with them chicken legs.

30:48.805 --> 30:49.917
Baw-caw.

30:56.260 --> 30:58.748
Come on, Dylan,
honey.

31:02.372 --> 31:04.379
Look out!
Look out!

31:11.653 --> 31:12.599
- What?
- Hey!

31:12.695 --> 31:13.954
The television said

31:14.052 --> 31:15.427
they started
the looting already.

31:15.524 --> 31:16.637
Vultures.

31:16.740 --> 31:17.788
You still have
the Plymouth?

31:17.892 --> 31:19.747
You want
to borrow the car?

31:19.845 --> 31:21.536
David, you don't
have a license.

31:21.636 --> 31:22.583
You're driving.

31:22.679 --> 31:24.418
Yeah, I'm driv... I'm driving?

31:24.516 --> 31:25.475
Come on, come on.

31:26.565 --> 31:29.565
I really want you
out of Los Angeles.

31:29.668 --> 31:31.294
You're staying there
to keep people calm.

31:31.396 --> 31:32.673
It's the right
thing to do.

31:32.773 --> 31:34.366
I'm not going to let them
criticize you for it.

31:34.468 --> 31:35.962
I appreciate your
trying to help me.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.530
Liar. Stick
to the truth.

31:37.636 --> 31:39.098
It's what
you're good at.

31:39.204 --> 31:40.163
All right.
I'll tell you the truth.

31:40.260 --> 31:41.569
I don't want you in
any one of those cities.

31:42.852 --> 31:44.925
I'll leave as soon as
the interviews are done.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.036
All right. There's
a helicopter waiting.

31:47.140 --> 31:48.798
They're going to take
you to Nellis.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.078
And the munchkin?

31:50.180 --> 31:51.228
She's going
to meet you there.

31:51.332 --> 31:52.314
All right.

31:52.421 --> 31:54.177
I love you.

31:54.276 --> 31:55.683
I love you.

31:55.780 --> 31:56.731
Bye.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.081
Communication
attempts in 30 languages

31:58.181 --> 31:59.490
over all common frequencies
have failed.

31:59.588 --> 32:00.547
Bye.

32:02.340 --> 32:04.162
It's the White House,

32:04.260 --> 32:05.215
for crying out loud.

32:05.311 --> 32:06.975
You can't just drive up
and ring a bell.

32:07.077 --> 32:08.670
Can't this thing
go any faster?

32:08.772 --> 32:10.114
What, you think they don't
know what you know?

32:10.213 --> 32:11.260
They know.
Believe me, they know.

32:11.364 --> 32:12.379
She works for the president.

32:12.485 --> 32:13.695
They know everything.

32:13.797 --> 32:15.007
They don't know this.

32:15.109 --> 32:16.515
Oh, oh. You're going
to educate them, huh?

32:16.612 --> 32:17.954
So tell me something.

32:18.052 --> 32:19.002
You're so smart,

32:19.098 --> 32:20.222
how come you spend
eight years at M.I.T.

32:20.325 --> 32:21.535
to become a cable
repairman?

32:21.637 --> 32:22.913
All I'm saying is
they got people

32:23.012 --> 32:24.419
who handle these things,
David.

32:24.517 --> 32:26.491
They want HBO,
they'll call you.

32:26.596 --> 32:28.985
Look at these people.
Look. Huh?

32:29.092 --> 32:30.039
Vultures.

32:30.135 --> 32:31.165
They take,
and then they go.

32:31.268 --> 32:32.215
Yeah. They're going.

32:32.311 --> 32:33.227
They're going faster
than we are.

32:33.323 --> 32:34.365
Look at this.
We're in the fast lane.

32:34.469 --> 32:35.614
They're cutting me
off here.

32:35.716 --> 32:37.211
No one's cutting you off.
We're going to get a ticket.

32:37.316 --> 32:38.298
They're getting
in front of me.

32:38.405 --> 32:39.452
I can't go any faster.

32:39.556 --> 32:40.636
All right. All right.
I don't want to argue.

32:40.740 --> 32:43.009
Let's just get there
as quickly as possible.

32:43.109 --> 32:44.059
What's the rush?

32:44.155 --> 32:45.213
You think we'll
get to Washington,

32:45.316 --> 32:46.942
it won't be there?

32:47.045 --> 32:48.506
A local crop duster

32:48.644 --> 32:49.724
was arrested today

32:49.829 --> 32:51.869
as he papered city hall
with leaflets from the air.

32:51.972 --> 32:53.019
Everybody's
leaving.

32:53.124 --> 32:54.071
Can you give us
some of your time?

32:54.166 --> 32:55.082
Do you want to make
a statement?

32:55.178 --> 32:56.222
We've got to stop them!

32:56.324 --> 32:59.106
I was kidnapped by space
aliens 10 years ago.

32:59.204 --> 33:01.092
They did all kinds
of experiments on me.

33:01.189 --> 33:02.847
They've been studying us
for years,

33:02.948 --> 33:04.159
finding out our weaknesses.

33:04.260 --> 33:05.602
We've gotta stop them!

33:05.700 --> 33:07.522
They're gonna kill us all!

33:07.620 --> 33:08.962
Some people

33:09.060 --> 33:10.369
attribute his
eccentric behavior

33:10.468 --> 33:11.810
to post-traumatic
stress syndrome

33:11.909 --> 33:13.981
from his service
as a pilot in Vietnam.

33:14.085 --> 33:16.452
Others, however,
have a more unusual theory.

33:16.548 --> 33:18.075
How would you
describe Mr. Casse?

33:18.180 --> 33:19.522
- Private.
- Keeps to himself.

33:19.620 --> 33:20.962
- Real quiet.
- Quiet.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.718
When they took him up
in the spaceship,

33:22.821 --> 33:25.439
the aliens abused him...

33:25.540 --> 33:26.947
sexually.

33:27.044 --> 33:28.866
Mr. Casse is
in the county lockup

33:28.964 --> 33:30.077
this evening...

33:30.180 --> 33:31.838
Pack up.
We're leaving.

33:31.940 --> 33:33.696
Due to extenuating
circumstances,

33:33.796 --> 33:35.155
he may be released
later tonight.

33:35.251 --> 33:37.059
Miguel, what about Dad?

33:38.430 --> 33:40.819
This could be our
last night on Earth.

33:42.333 --> 33:44.635
You don't want
to die a virgin...

33:44.734 --> 33:45.680
do you?

33:45.776 --> 33:47.155
Come on. We're going.

33:47.262 --> 33:49.084
No. I'm not
going anywhere.

33:49.182 --> 33:50.524
Miguel!

33:50.781 --> 33:51.829
Stop it!

33:56.189 --> 33:57.684
Thanks a lot, partner.

33:59.965 --> 34:02.420
You read my mind!

34:02.526 --> 34:04.444
Stay here.

34:04.638 --> 34:07.125
We got to get as far away
from these things as we can.

34:07.230 --> 34:08.572
They let you out?

34:08.668 --> 34:10.011
You're damn right.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.899
They got bigger fish
to fry now,

34:11.996 --> 34:13.241
believe you me.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.967
Come on, boy.

34:15.069 --> 34:17.719
We're leavin'... without you.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.539
We're going to live
with Uncle Hector in Tucson.

34:22.141 --> 34:24.116
Ha ha ha ha! Hector?

34:24.221 --> 34:25.782
Like hell you are.

34:25.885 --> 34:27.543
I'm still your father.

34:27.646 --> 34:29.850
No, you're not.

34:29.949 --> 34:32.469
You're just the man
who married my mother.

34:32.574 --> 34:33.915
You're nothin' to me.

34:34.014 --> 34:34.973
Oh.

34:37.405 --> 34:38.364
Oh...

34:40.126 --> 34:41.981
Well, what about Troy?

34:42.078 --> 34:43.024
Troy?

34:43.120 --> 34:44.040
Yeah.

34:44.136 --> 34:45.077
For once in your life,

34:45.181 --> 34:47.799
why don't you think about
what's best for him?

34:47.902 --> 34:49.047
Just who in the hell
has to beg for money

34:49.150 --> 34:52.018
to buy him medicine when you
screw up, huh?! Who?! Who?!

34:52.125 --> 34:54.842
You stop it right now!

34:54.940 --> 34:57.592
I'm not a baby anymore!

34:57.694 --> 34:59.766
And I don't want
your stupid medicine,

34:59.870 --> 35:01.692
'cause I'm
so sick of medicine!

35:01.790 --> 35:04.604
Do you know what
this stuff costs?

35:04.701 --> 35:06.611
Do you want
to get sick again?

35:06.717 --> 35:08.060
Do you?

35:09.566 --> 35:10.405
Once again, the L.A.P.D.
is asking Los Angelenos

35:10.501 --> 35:12.444
Once again, the L.A.P.D.
is asking Los Angelenos

35:12.542 --> 35:15.258
not to fire their guns
at the visitor spacecraft.

35:15.357 --> 35:18.139
You may inadvertently
trigger an interstellar war.

35:18.237 --> 35:20.310
Think we can find
something better

35:20.413 --> 35:21.755
to do with our time,
gentlemen?

35:21.854 --> 35:23.676
Where you been, Stevie?

35:23.774 --> 35:25.115
Man, this
is unbelievable.

35:25.213 --> 35:26.555
This is, like, huge.

35:26.654 --> 35:27.995
They've recalled
everybody.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.948
Oh. Well, looks like
the mail's still working.

35:31.837 --> 35:32.852
Oh. Oh, oh.

35:34.508 --> 35:36.963
Uh, you got to do
the honors for me, man.

35:37.068 --> 35:38.410
You're a wuss.

35:38.508 --> 35:40.330
Yeah, whatever.
Shut up and read it.

35:40.428 --> 35:41.507
It says...

35:41.612 --> 35:43.434
"Captain
Steven Hiller,"

35:43.532 --> 35:44.612
loser.

35:44.715 --> 35:46.090
"United States
Marine Corps..."

35:46.188 --> 35:47.333
Blah blah blah
blah blah blah.

35:47.436 --> 35:50.218
"We regret to inform you

35:50.316 --> 35:53.000
that despite your excellent
record of service..."

35:55.308 --> 35:56.715
I'm sorry, man.

35:56.812 --> 35:59.332
You know what
you need to do?

35:59.436 --> 36:01.923
You need to, like,
kiss some serious booty

36:02.028 --> 36:03.238
to get ahead
in this world, man.

36:03.340 --> 36:04.802
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

36:04.908 --> 36:06.730
See, I like
the one-knee approach

36:06.828 --> 36:08.650
because it puts
the booty, like,

36:08.748 --> 36:10.090
right in front
of the lips...

36:11.276 --> 36:12.618
What's this?

36:12.716 --> 36:13.763
- That's nothing.
- Hold on.

36:13.867 --> 36:14.826
Hold on, man.
What is this?

36:14.924 --> 36:16.746
Jasmine kind of has
a thing for dolphins.

36:16.844 --> 36:18.153
I don't know.

36:18.252 --> 36:20.805
Stevie, this is
a wedding ring.

36:24.556 --> 36:26.890
I thought you said
you were going

36:26.988 --> 36:28.810
to break the whole
thing off.

36:28.908 --> 36:30.250
Yeah...

36:32.140 --> 36:34.279
Man, you know I really
like Jasmine.

36:34.379 --> 36:35.786
You know that, right?

36:35.884 --> 36:37.226
Man, you're never going

36:37.324 --> 36:39.779
to get to fly
the Space Shuttle

36:39.884 --> 36:41.226
if you marry a stripper.

36:47.916 --> 36:49.290
Barry Nolan On TV:

36:49.387 --> 36:50.816
..."it could only happen
in California" file,

36:50.924 --> 36:52.746
here's Wendy Walsh
with a special report.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.666
Below us,

36:54.764 --> 36:56.040
we can see hundreds
of UFO fanatics

36:56.140 --> 36:57.962
who have gathered
on rooftops

36:58.060 --> 36:59.238
here
in downtown Los Angeles

36:59.339 --> 37:00.965
to welcome
the new arrivals.

37:01.067 --> 37:03.369
Oh, God! I hope
they bring back Elvis!

37:03.468 --> 37:05.889
I just came in to get
my check tonight,

37:05.996 --> 37:07.240
and I got talked
into working.

37:07.340 --> 37:09.445
Oh, I must have
been tripping.

37:09.547 --> 37:10.856
It's being called

37:10.956 --> 37:12.298
the party event
of the century,

37:12.396 --> 37:14.184
and everyone is invited,
especially you know who.

37:14.284 --> 37:15.658
This is so cool.

37:15.756 --> 37:16.738
Girl, please.

37:16.844 --> 37:20.837
Oh, hey. I made it
before I came in tonight.

37:20.940 --> 37:23.111
Check it out.

37:23.212 --> 37:25.034
Now I know you're not

37:25.132 --> 37:26.309
thinking about
joining those idiots.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.211
Oh, I am going over there
as soon as I get off.

37:29.307 --> 37:30.254
You want to come?

37:30.350 --> 37:31.297
Tiffany,
listen to me a sec.

37:32.570 --> 37:34.545
I have got a really
bad feeling about this.

37:34.650 --> 37:36.505
I don't want you to go.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.424
Oh, like the really
bad feeling you got

37:38.522 --> 37:40.245
when I went to Las Vegas?

37:40.346 --> 37:41.556
Yeah, and I was right.
You didn't get the job,

37:41.658 --> 37:43.567
and you lost
all your money gambling.

37:43.674 --> 37:47.568
Yeah, but I wasn't in L.A.
for the earthquake.

37:47.674 --> 37:50.095
Tiff, I really don't
want you to go up there.

37:50.202 --> 37:51.544
Now promise me
you won't.

37:51.642 --> 37:52.585
Oh.

37:52.681 --> 37:54.609
Come on, girl,
promise me.

37:55.706 --> 37:57.593
I promise.

37:57.690 --> 37:58.649
OK.

37:59.770 --> 38:03.223
Look... I'm goin'.

38:03.450 --> 38:04.912
I'm out of town
for a while.

38:05.018 --> 38:05.965
Later.

38:06.061 --> 38:07.008
Bye.

38:07.386 --> 38:10.681
Hey, there's my angel.
Come on.

38:10.778 --> 38:12.207
Come on, Boomer.
Let's go, y'all.

38:12.315 --> 38:14.453
Hey. Come on. Talk
to your boyfriend later.

38:14.554 --> 38:17.237
Hey, what the hell is the kid
doin' here, huh... Oh!

38:17.338 --> 38:19.225
You try finding
a sitter today.

38:19.322 --> 38:21.013
Hey, where do you think
you're goin'?

38:21.114 --> 38:22.060
You leave, you're fired.

38:22.156 --> 38:24.463
Nice workin'
with ya, Mario.

38:24.570 --> 38:25.529
Come on, Boomer.

38:32.186 --> 38:33.200
Everyone in the world

38:33.306 --> 38:34.265
is trying to get out
of Washington.

38:34.362 --> 38:35.398
We're the only schmucks
trying to get in.

38:35.494 --> 38:36.453
Radio:... should establish
some line of communication.

38:38.250 --> 38:39.297
What the hell is that?

38:39.402 --> 38:42.071
Pops, this is every
phone book in America.

38:42.167 --> 38:43.114
You think an important
person like Constance

38:43.210 --> 38:44.158
is going to be listed?

38:45.432 --> 38:47.701
She always keeps
her portable phone

38:47.800 --> 38:49.360
listed for emergencies.

38:49.464 --> 38:50.773
Sometimes it's just
her first initial.

38:50.873 --> 38:52.695
Sometimes it's her nickname.

38:52.793 --> 38:54.102
Sometimes it's just her...

38:54.201 --> 38:55.607
Oy, my God!

38:55.704 --> 38:57.111
Hey, hey, hey!
Slow it down!

38:57.208 --> 38:58.550
Tell them!

38:58.649 --> 39:00.852
Where are they going,
all these people?!

39:00.952 --> 39:02.610
- Stop!
- Tell them! Tell them!

39:04.761 --> 39:06.321
Slow it down!

39:07.768 --> 39:09.775
Oh! Oh! Oh!

39:09.880 --> 39:12.051
Slow it down!
Watch out, boy!

39:12.152 --> 39:14.039
All right! We made it!
We made it!

39:14.136 --> 39:15.095
My goodness.

39:17.816 --> 39:18.961
Nice driving, Pops.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.407
Well...

39:21.560 --> 39:23.567
So, not listed, huh?

39:23.672 --> 39:25.679
No, no. I just
haven't found it yet.

39:25.785 --> 39:29.134
Um... I tried C. Spano
and Connie Spano...

39:29.240 --> 39:30.353
Spunky Spano...

39:30.456 --> 39:31.799
Spunky?

39:32.632 --> 39:33.712
College nickname.

39:33.817 --> 39:35.605
Ah... cute.

39:35.704 --> 39:37.078
You try Levinson?

39:37.176 --> 39:39.413
No. She didn't take my name
when we were married.

39:39.512 --> 39:40.560
Uh, why would she...
What are you talking about?

39:40.664 --> 39:41.611
Try it.

39:41.707 --> 39:44.046
It isn't here. Look.

39:47.928 --> 39:51.376
Uh-huh. So what
do I know, hmm?

40:01.688 --> 40:04.372
So... you want
to ring the bell

40:04.472 --> 40:05.552
or should I?

40:07.576 --> 40:08.511
Hmm?

40:08.607 --> 40:09.681
Oh, perfect.
She's using it.

40:09.784 --> 40:11.061
Perfect. What's perfect?
It's busy.

40:11.161 --> 40:12.721
Yeah. I can use her
signal to triangulate

40:14.373 --> 40:16.446
to triangulate her exact position
in the White House.

40:16.549 --> 40:18.371
You can do that?

40:18.469 --> 40:19.428
Yeah.

40:19.749 --> 40:21.756
All cable repairmen
can, Pops.

40:21.861 --> 40:23.421
The visitors have arrived,

40:23.525 --> 40:25.118
but the president remains
at the White House.

40:25.221 --> 40:29.858
Are Mr. Whitmore's
actions A... ultra brave...

40:31.077 --> 40:32.419
or B... foolhardy?

40:32.517 --> 40:33.463
What?

40:33.559 --> 40:35.778
Now,
don't hang up, sweetie.

40:35.877 --> 40:37.306
David. How did you
get this number?

40:37.412 --> 40:38.787
Do me a favor.
Walk to the window.

40:38.885 --> 40:41.568
And I'm looking for what?

40:41.669 --> 40:43.523
You'll see.

40:43.621 --> 40:45.476
Over here.

40:46.660 --> 40:47.607
See us?

40:47.703 --> 40:48.668
We're here.

40:48.773 --> 40:51.075
How does he
do that?

40:51.173 --> 40:53.955
Reporting live
from Andrews Air Force Base

40:54.053 --> 40:55.744
just outside
Washington, D.C...

40:55.845 --> 40:58.049
Yes, that's right, Tom,
an amazing moment.

40:58.149 --> 41:00.004
We're reporting from
Andrews Air Force Base...

41:00.100 --> 41:01.278
Now in light of our
apparent inability

41:01.381 --> 41:02.690
to communicate
with the visitors,

41:02.789 --> 41:03.803
Pentagon officials

41:03.909 --> 41:05.916
have retrofit
this skylift helicopter

41:06.021 --> 41:08.508
with a type of visual
communications device.

41:08.613 --> 41:09.660
Mr. President.

41:09.765 --> 41:10.715
Be seated.

41:10.811 --> 41:12.219
This is not
a military aircraft...

41:12.324 --> 41:13.666
Where are we now?

41:13.765 --> 41:15.390
They're just
commencing liftoff.

41:15.493 --> 41:16.835
Reporter:... and refitted

41:16.933 --> 41:18.176
with these enormous
light panels that are

41:18.277 --> 41:20.928
attached to the hull
and onto the sides.

41:21.029 --> 41:21.988
Echo One,

41:22.085 --> 41:23.035
Welcome Wagon
is in the air.

41:23.131 --> 41:25.084
I repeat.
Welcome Wagon is in the air.

41:25.189 --> 41:26.465
Roger, Welcome Wagon.

41:26.565 --> 41:28.475
Echo One
right beside you.

41:28.581 --> 41:29.540
This is something

41:29.637 --> 41:30.584
I would never believe
in my lifetime,

41:30.679 --> 41:32.004
that I would be
in the White House.

41:32.101 --> 41:33.442
Look at this.

41:33.541 --> 41:35.199
If I knew I was going
to meet the president,

41:35.301 --> 41:36.959
I would have
worn a tie.

41:37.061 --> 41:38.916
I mean, look at me.
I look like a schlemiel.

41:39.013 --> 41:40.354
You look fine, Pops.

41:40.453 --> 41:42.242
Oy, my God.

41:42.340 --> 41:43.999
David, I don't know how happy
he's going to be to see you.

41:44.101 --> 41:45.149
That's right.
I'm telling you,

41:45.253 --> 41:46.200
we're wasting time.

41:46.296 --> 41:47.207
He's not going
to listen to me.

41:47.303 --> 41:48.178
We should go.

41:48.274 --> 41:49.138
Why wouldn't
he listen?

41:49.234 --> 41:50.098
'Cause last time
I saw him,

41:50.194 --> 41:51.058
we, uh, we got
into a fight.

41:51.154 --> 41:52.018
You walked in the room

41:52.114 --> 41:52.978
and punched him in the head.

41:53.074 --> 41:53.958
You punched
the president?

41:54.054 --> 41:55.100
He wasn't
the president then.

41:55.205 --> 41:56.994
I punched him,
he fought back.

41:57.092 --> 41:58.434
We wrestled around.
It was a fight.

41:58.533 --> 41:59.580
A fight
that you started,

41:59.685 --> 42:00.635
because David thought that
I was having an affair.

42:00.731 --> 42:01.658
With the president?

42:01.754 --> 42:02.690
Which, of course,
I wasn't.

42:03.956 --> 42:05.036
You know, either
go get him,

42:05.141 --> 42:06.188
or we should head
back to the car.

42:06.292 --> 42:07.754
All right. I'll get him.
You wait here,

42:07.860 --> 42:09.322
and don't touch anything.

42:09.429 --> 42:11.600
You punched the president?

42:11.700 --> 42:13.227
Mein Gott!

42:21.044 --> 42:22.899
Nearing point of contact,
Echo One.

42:22.996 --> 42:24.011
We're closing in.

42:24.116 --> 42:25.075
Roger that.

42:25.172 --> 42:26.765
You're a go to commence
sequence when ready.

42:29.012 --> 42:31.314
This I like.

42:31.669 --> 42:33.010
Look at this.

42:33.108 --> 42:37.167
You know what famous people
have been here, hmm? Hmm?

42:37.268 --> 42:39.756
Politicians, actors...

42:39.861 --> 42:42.130
baseball players, singers...

42:42.229 --> 42:43.822
and now me.

42:43.924 --> 42:45.168
Imagine that. Look,
a poor immigrant like me.

42:45.300 --> 42:46.243
- It's a dream!
- Shh! Shh!

42:46.339 --> 42:47.283
David, please!

42:48.852 --> 42:50.674
The three choppers
are steadily approaching

42:50.772 --> 42:53.554
what has been unanimously
agreed to be

42:53.652 --> 42:54.602
the front
of these spaceships,

42:54.698 --> 42:56.749
a parabolic indentation
9 city blocks...

42:56.851 --> 42:58.029
You're leaving now?

42:59.156 --> 43:00.268
David, see if they
got those pens

43:00.372 --> 43:01.452
that they give away.

43:01.555 --> 43:02.766
Dad, what?

43:05.939 --> 43:07.183
I don't have time
for this.

43:07.284 --> 43:08.713
- Two minutes, Tom.
- Connie...

43:08.819 --> 43:09.766
Mr. President.

43:09.861 --> 43:11.372
Julius Levinson.
David is my son.

43:11.476 --> 43:12.752
I told you
he wouldn't listen.

43:12.852 --> 43:14.543
David, you have
to tell him.

43:14.643 --> 43:15.594
Connie.

43:15.690 --> 43:17.064
David, tell him!

43:19.507 --> 43:22.475
Uh, I know why we have
satellite disruption.

43:25.267 --> 43:26.413
All right. Go ahead.

43:26.515 --> 43:27.450
OK.

43:27.546 --> 43:28.481
Um...

43:29.235 --> 43:32.464
Let's say that you want to
coordinate with spaceships

43:32.563 --> 43:34.319
on different sides
of the Earth.

43:34.420 --> 43:36.973
You couldn't send
a direct signal, right?

43:38.131 --> 43:39.887
You're talking about
line of sight.

43:39.987 --> 43:41.329
Yeah, that's right.
Exactly.

43:41.427 --> 43:43.020
The curve of the Earth
prevents it.

43:43.123 --> 43:44.367
You'd need satellites
to relay that signal

43:44.467 --> 43:46.355
in order to reach
each ship.

43:46.452 --> 43:48.786
Well, I found a signal

43:48.883 --> 43:52.495
hidden inside our own
satellite system.

43:53.843 --> 43:55.272
Excuse me, Mr. President.

43:55.379 --> 43:57.583
They're starting.

43:59.539 --> 44:02.800
They're using our own
satellites against us...

44:06.259 --> 44:07.568
and the clock is ticking.

44:11.827 --> 44:13.136
Bringing it in to hover.

44:13.235 --> 44:14.181
Welcome Wagon,
Echo One.

44:14.277 --> 44:16.267
Approaching
alien ship.

44:18.132 --> 44:20.172
Initiating communications
sequence, Echo One.

44:21.460 --> 44:24.045
Welcome Wagon
has commenced.

44:29.459 --> 44:31.434
General Grey, coordinate
with the Atlantic Command.

44:31.539 --> 44:33.361
Tell them to evacuate
as many people

44:33.459 --> 44:35.281
out of the cities
as they can.

44:35.379 --> 44:36.394
Yes, sir.

44:36.499 --> 44:37.677
Get those helicopters
away from the ship.

44:37.780 --> 44:39.121
Call them back
immediately.

44:39.219 --> 44:40.561
What the hell's going on?

44:40.660 --> 44:42.089
We're leaving.
Kim, my daughter.

44:43.379 --> 44:45.932
Uh, there's something
happening here.

44:49.651 --> 44:50.598
They're responding.

44:50.694 --> 44:51.605
Something's opening.

44:51.701 --> 44:53.164
Something
is happening.

44:56.083 --> 44:57.577
It looks like there's some
kind of activity here.

44:57.683 --> 44:59.626
This may be some type
of response, Echo One.

44:59.731 --> 45:01.673
We see it, too.
Can't identify it.

45:13.171 --> 45:14.513
We are evacuating.

45:14.611 --> 45:15.558
I repeat.

45:15.654 --> 45:16.749
We are evacuating
the White House.

45:16.851 --> 45:18.923
Load the rest
of the staff

45:19.027 --> 45:21.612
in the second
helicopter.

45:21.715 --> 45:23.406
Who should we pick?

45:23.508 --> 45:25.264
Is my wife
in the air?

45:25.363 --> 45:26.476
She will be shortly.

45:26.579 --> 45:27.757
Nice. Very nice.

45:27.859 --> 45:30.095
OK. Buckle up.
Latch secure.

45:30.195 --> 45:32.683
Look, we have
our own phone.

45:35.795 --> 45:37.104
Let's move
outta here!

45:39.059 --> 45:40.881
The president's
ordered an evacuation.

45:40.979 --> 45:42.321
We have to leave now.

45:42.419 --> 45:43.761
And our prayers go out

45:43.859 --> 45:44.939
to the wives and children
of those brave pilots.

45:45.043 --> 45:47.377
Indeed, God help us all.

45:47.475 --> 45:48.817
The visitors responded

45:48.915 --> 45:50.028
with terrifying...

45:50.131 --> 45:51.954
Authorities
have called for

45:52.051 --> 45:53.874
a complete evacuation
of Los Angeles County.

45:53.971 --> 45:55.313
People are advised

45:55.411 --> 45:56.753
to avoid the highways
wherever possible.

45:56.851 --> 45:59.186
Oh, yeah. Great.
Now he tells me.

46:04.531 --> 46:05.873
This is

46:05.971 --> 46:07.247
the Los Angeles
Police Department.

46:07.347 --> 46:10.544
Please vacate the premises
immediately

46:10.643 --> 46:12.531
for your own safety.

46:14.227 --> 46:15.242
Take me!

46:15.347 --> 46:16.362
Take me!

46:28.051 --> 46:29.327
Can we move it along?

46:30.547 --> 46:31.562
Dr. Katz's
office.

46:31.667 --> 46:32.845
Hello. Let me speak
to Dr. Katz, please.

46:32.947 --> 46:34.125
I'm sorry.
He's not available.

46:34.227 --> 46:35.405
Listen, for $300 an hour,
you can put me through

46:35.507 --> 46:36.936
to his house
in the Hamptons!

46:44.404 --> 46:47.251
This is the Los Angeles
Police Department.

46:47.347 --> 46:48.286
Please vacate the premises
immediately

46:48.382 --> 46:50.066
Please vacate the premises
immediately

46:50.164 --> 46:51.724
for your own safety.

46:53.843 --> 46:54.802
Mrs. Whitmore.

46:56.243 --> 46:58.031
You must leave now.

47:03.955 --> 47:05.810
First lady secured.
We're on the move.

47:14.803 --> 47:15.758
Look!

47:15.854 --> 47:17.137
They're opening up!

47:28.915 --> 47:30.923
It's so pretty.

47:56.979 --> 47:58.386
We gotta get
the hell outta here!

48:11.603 --> 48:13.905
Go ahead, pilot. We're ready
to take off right now.

48:14.003 --> 48:16.392
Can you get a blanket
for Patricia?

48:20.339 --> 48:21.298
Here.

48:23.923 --> 48:24.882
Over there?

48:36.115 --> 48:37.326
Time's up.

49:01.779 --> 49:02.738
Get down!

49:38.483 --> 49:40.209
Oh, crap.

51:13.714 --> 51:14.665
Oh, my God.

51:14.761 --> 51:15.852
Come on, Dylan.
We gotta go.

51:15.955 --> 51:17.199
Come on, Boomer.

51:55.827 --> 51:57.169
Boomer!

52:00.915 --> 52:01.874
Boomer!

52:28.083 --> 52:29.425
Reports are unclear

52:29.523 --> 52:31.563
as to the extent of
the devastation,

52:31.667 --> 52:33.009
but, from all accounts,
Los Angeles, Washington,

52:33.107 --> 52:35.049
and New York have been
left in ruins...

52:35.155 --> 52:36.881
Good God!

52:37.299 --> 52:38.760
I been saying it.

52:38.867 --> 52:40.939
I been saying it
for 10 damn years.

52:41.043 --> 52:43.628
Ain't I been
saying it, Miguel?

52:43.731 --> 52:45.160
Huh?
I been saying it.

52:45.266 --> 52:47.787
Dad, I'm sick.
I don't feel good.

52:47.891 --> 52:49.036
Pull it over, man.

52:57.331 --> 52:59.186
We're going to be
all right, Troy.

52:59.283 --> 53:00.624
Leave me alone, man.
I got it.

53:04.403 --> 53:05.746
Miguel.

53:06.163 --> 53:08.072
Look at all that.

53:29.523 --> 53:33.167
We could have evacuated
the cities hours ago.

53:35.602 --> 53:38.701
That's the advantage
of being a fighter pilot.

53:38.803 --> 53:40.745
In the Gulf War,

53:40.850 --> 53:42.377
we knew what
we had to do.

53:44.307 --> 53:49.544
It's just...
not simple anymore.

53:49.650 --> 53:51.952
A lot of people
died today.

53:56.403 --> 53:59.273
How many didn't have to?

54:01.395 --> 54:03.631
Any news
on my wife yet?

54:05.043 --> 54:07.978
The helicopter never
made it to Nellis.

54:09.683 --> 54:11.090
No radio contact.

54:18.483 --> 54:20.490
Come on, Dylan.
Stay close.

54:29.523 --> 54:30.864
Here it is.

54:54.643 --> 54:57.163
What happened, Mommy?

54:58.739 --> 55:01.488
I don't know, baby.

55:01.586 --> 55:02.928
You men will be

55:03.027 --> 55:03.986
the first wave
in our counterattack.

55:04.083 --> 55:06.449
Our target
is to the north

55:06.546 --> 55:09.743
centered above what remains
of downtown Los Angeles...

55:09.843 --> 55:12.911
You scared, man?

55:13.043 --> 55:14.002
No.

55:14.578 --> 55:15.537
You?

55:16.498 --> 55:17.457
Nope.

55:17.618 --> 55:19.757
We will fix on
our target positions...

55:19.859 --> 55:20.873
Hold me.

55:20.979 --> 55:22.801
Hey, pay attention.

55:22.899 --> 55:24.721
Something you want to
add to this briefing,

55:24.819 --> 55:25.931
Captain Hiller?

55:26.035 --> 55:27.922
No, sir. I'm just a little
anxious to get up there

55:28.018 --> 55:29.447
and whup E.T.'s ass,
that's all.

55:31.187 --> 55:33.162
And you'll get
your chance.

55:33.266 --> 55:35.600
You'll all
get your chance.

55:35.698 --> 55:37.389
Good hunting.

55:37.491 --> 55:38.898
Dismissed.

55:38.994 --> 55:41.296
Let's kick the tires
and light the fires,

55:41.395 --> 55:42.354
big daddy.

55:45.875 --> 55:47.052
Let's bring it home.

55:47.155 --> 55:48.497
Let's bring that
bad boy home, Captain.

55:48.594 --> 55:49.541
You loose?

55:49.637 --> 55:50.548
Yes, sir.

55:50.644 --> 55:51.856
You got
your victory dance?

55:51.955 --> 55:54.094
Well, I got it
right heeere.

55:54.194 --> 55:55.153
Yeah!

55:55.314 --> 55:57.137
Hey, hey. Don't get
premature on me, soldier.

55:57.234 --> 55:59.057
We don't light up
till the fat lady sings.

55:59.154 --> 56:00.649
I'm all ears,
brother.

56:09.394 --> 56:10.507
You the man!

56:15.091 --> 56:17.131
All right, gentlemen,
we're on.

56:17.234 --> 56:19.885
General, it's NORAD.

56:19.987 --> 56:21.263
General Grey here.

56:21.363 --> 56:22.322
Al?

56:22.546 --> 56:24.968
All satellite, microwave,
and ground communications

56:25.074 --> 56:26.122
with the cities are down.

56:26.226 --> 56:27.753
All systems go.

56:27.859 --> 56:29.517
We believe we're looking
at a total loss.

56:29.618 --> 56:32.106
How about our boys?
Where are they?

56:32.211 --> 56:34.796
ETA to target,
four minutes.

56:42.835 --> 56:44.329
I shouldn't have
left her.

56:44.435 --> 56:46.223
Don't worry about it,
big man.

56:46.323 --> 56:48.527
I'm sure she got out of here
before it happened.

56:48.627 --> 56:52.750
Or, as the good reverend
would say,

56:54.291 --> 56:56.658
"Why we're on this particular
mission we'll never know.

56:56.754 --> 57:00.683
But I do know, here today,
that the Black Knights

57:00.786 --> 57:02.826
will emerge victorious
once again."

57:02.931 --> 57:04.556
Amen, man.

57:04.659 --> 57:05.903
Amen, Reverend.

57:18.866 --> 57:20.592
Holy God.

57:24.467 --> 57:26.289
Lock and load.

57:29.074 --> 57:30.021
Roger that.

57:30.117 --> 57:31.032
Los Angeles
Attack Squadron

57:31.128 --> 57:32.553
has Amraam missiles
locked on target.

57:32.658 --> 57:35.341
Washington and New York
squadrons reporting lock on.

57:35.442 --> 57:36.522
Fire at will.

57:36.626 --> 57:37.573
Fire at will.

57:37.669 --> 57:38.616
Fire at will.

57:40.179 --> 57:41.389
Knights,
we are red and free.

57:41.491 --> 57:43.946
Knight 1, Fox 3.

57:44.050 --> 57:45.065
Knight 3, Fox 3.

57:46.322 --> 57:47.281
Knight 7, Fox 3.

57:49.810 --> 57:50.769
Missiles
have been fired.

58:10.706 --> 58:12.113
Are they not
getting through?

58:12.211 --> 58:13.737
No, sir. Not one.

58:13.842 --> 58:15.402
Command, Knight 1.
Command, Knight 1.

58:15.506 --> 58:16.815
Switching to sidewinders.
Moving in.

58:20.434 --> 58:23.501
Knight 3, Love 50.
Notch reference 1-2-0.

58:24.626 --> 58:26.601
Knight 7.
1-2-0.

58:26.707 --> 58:27.983
Knight 1.
Sweet luck.

58:28.083 --> 58:29.130
Echo, Fox 2.

58:29.235 --> 58:30.194
Knight 7, Fox 2.

58:34.866 --> 58:35.825
Come on. Come on.

58:41.619 --> 58:42.764
They must have some kind
of protective shield

58:42.866 --> 58:43.825
over their hull.

58:43.922 --> 58:44.937
Knights!
Pull up! Pull up!

58:50.290 --> 58:51.370
Knight 3, pull up!

58:51.475 --> 58:53.362
Controls are showing
complete failure of the stats.

58:53.458 --> 58:54.993
Pull up!

58:55.218 --> 58:56.177
Aah!

59:02.866 --> 59:04.459
Blow through!
Blow through!

59:04.563 --> 59:06.254
There's so many
of them!

59:07.762 --> 59:08.721
Aah!

59:09.426 --> 59:10.986
They got
another one, sir.

59:14.259 --> 59:17.106
Oh, no. You did not shoot
that green shit at me.

59:19.954 --> 59:20.936
I've got you covered,
big daddy.

59:25.618 --> 59:26.731
Damn. They got
shields, too.

59:37.586 --> 59:38.863
Let's go, Knights.
Move, Knights, move!

59:42.674 --> 59:43.633
Aah!

59:43.986 --> 59:45.137
Jesus.

59:45.746 --> 59:47.818
They got another one, sir.
Two more just went down.

59:47.922 --> 59:49.002
They're dropping
like flies.

59:49.106 --> 59:50.121
We're losing them.

59:50.227 --> 59:51.917
All right. Get them
out of there.

59:52.018 --> 59:54.025
Squadron leaders, retreat
to fallback positions.

59:54.131 --> 59:55.887
Abort mission right away.
Do you read me?

59:55.986 --> 59:56.946
Do you copy?

01:00:00.146 --> 01:00:02.285
We're going to have to make
a run for this one here.

01:00:02.386 --> 01:00:03.564
Let's get low.
Let's get fast.

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.609
I got you, big daddy.
Let's get them.

01:00:05.714 --> 01:00:06.673
Whoo!

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:09.009
Watch the deck.

01:00:17.298 --> 01:00:19.054
Squadron Leader,
do you read?

01:00:19.154 --> 01:00:20.943
This isn't happening
fast enough.

01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:22.024
Get them out of there!

01:00:28.562 --> 01:00:30.701
What's with the monitor?
Where's the picture?

01:00:30.803 --> 01:00:31.817
We've lost
the satellite.

01:00:35.794 --> 01:00:37.899
We got two R-6,
Jimmy. Check them.

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:39.153
Roger.

01:00:40.659 --> 01:00:42.382
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move!

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:45.356
He's on me like white
on rice, big daddy.

01:00:45.459 --> 01:00:46.413
They ain't got
nothing for us.

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:48.075
Let's push it.
We've got to go.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:49.837
I can't shake him.
I can't shake him.

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:51.313
Yes, you can.
Just the way I showed you.

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:53.385
Check me out. I'm going
to try something.

01:00:53.491 --> 01:00:54.865
Don't do nothing stupid
over there.

01:00:54.963 --> 01:00:55.909
You know me.

01:00:56.005 --> 01:00:57.330
That's what
I'm talking about.

01:00:57.426 --> 01:00:59.630
Jimmy, what are you doing?
You can't bank at that speed.

01:01:00.786 --> 01:01:01.745
Jimmy, he's closing on you!

01:01:05.267 --> 01:01:07.089
Put your mask back on!
That's an order!

01:01:07.187 --> 01:01:08.364
I can't breathe!

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:10.801
Jimmy!

01:01:12.146 --> 01:01:13.297
Jimmy!

01:01:15.698 --> 01:01:17.040
Jimmy! No!

01:01:17.139 --> 01:01:18.665
That's affirmative.
We have incoming.

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:19.716
Let me have it, son.

01:01:19.812 --> 01:01:21.486
You got it.

01:01:21.587 --> 01:01:23.313
Friendly?

01:01:23.698 --> 01:01:24.909
Sergeant?

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:26.319
I don't think so.

01:01:30.802 --> 01:01:32.362
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:01:53.298 --> 01:01:54.640
Come on and get me!
Come and get me!

01:01:58.354 --> 01:02:00.176
Oh, what are you
shooting at?

01:02:01.394 --> 01:02:03.915
Where you at, baby?
Come on! Come on!

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.315
Aw, you can't hit nothing!

01:02:14.578 --> 01:02:15.537
Aah!

01:02:16.498 --> 01:02:17.841
Ha! Ha!

01:02:26.802 --> 01:02:28.624
Whoa! Low bridge!

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.606
See if you can fly
that thing undercover.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:40.847
Ha ha. Hope you got
an air bag.

01:02:42.642 --> 01:02:43.601
Whoa!

01:03:04.658 --> 01:03:06.349
Aah! Unh!

01:03:08.946 --> 01:03:10.539
Aah! Unh!

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.448
Son of a bitch.

01:03:20.498 --> 01:03:21.457
Aah!

01:03:22.514 --> 01:03:24.619
That's right!
That's right!

01:03:24.723 --> 01:03:26.413
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

01:03:26.514 --> 01:03:27.921
That's what you get!

01:03:28.018 --> 01:03:29.905
Ha ha!
Look at you!

01:03:30.002 --> 01:03:31.496
Ship all banged up!

01:03:31.602 --> 01:03:32.846
Who's the man?

01:03:32.946 --> 01:03:34.473
Huh? Who's the man?

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:35.952
Wait until I get
another plane!

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:38.439
I'm lining all your friends
up right beside you!

01:03:39.954 --> 01:03:41.198
Where you at, huh?

01:03:41.298 --> 01:03:42.574
Huh? Where you at?

01:03:53.522 --> 01:03:55.944
Welcome to Earth.

01:04:05.714 --> 01:04:08.583
Now, that's what I call
a close encounter.

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:13.636
Baby,
stay right here.

01:04:13.732 --> 01:04:15.144
Stay right here
with Boomer.

01:04:24.178 --> 01:04:25.137
Keys.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.085
Come on. Keys.

01:04:27.186 --> 01:04:28.121
Yes!

01:04:28.217 --> 01:04:30.018
Come on, baby.
Come on.

01:04:30.114 --> 01:04:31.060
Come on.

01:04:31.156 --> 01:04:32.104
Yes!

01:04:33.321 --> 01:04:34.979
Reports indicate
that this battle

01:04:35.081 --> 01:04:36.804
has repeated itself
all over the world

01:04:36.905 --> 01:04:38.727
with the exact
same results.

01:04:38.825 --> 01:04:41.192
You're just like your
mother, you know that?

01:04:41.289 --> 01:04:43.428
She was stubborn, too.

01:04:43.529 --> 01:04:45.351
Had to twist her arm

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:47.750
to get her
to take her medicine.

01:04:47.849 --> 01:04:49.791
You're gonna
be all right.

01:04:49.897 --> 01:04:50.911
You're gonna be fine.

01:04:53.321 --> 01:04:57.030
See, Troy? You're
feeling better already.

01:04:57.129 --> 01:04:59.431
I couldn't find anything.

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:01.122
Everyone's packing up.
They're leaving.

01:05:01.225 --> 01:05:03.134
They said there's a spaceship
heading this way.

01:05:03.241 --> 01:05:04.615
We'd better leave,
too, then.

01:05:06.504 --> 01:05:07.455
Penicillin.

01:05:07.551 --> 01:05:09.220
At least it'll help
keep his fever down.

01:05:09.321 --> 01:05:10.268
Oh, thank you.

01:05:10.364 --> 01:05:12.420
It's really nice
of you to help us.

01:05:12.521 --> 01:05:14.855
I wish I could do more,
but we're moving out.

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:17.157
I-I'm going with you.

01:05:19.913 --> 01:05:21.735
Um... Well, I... I just...

01:05:21.833 --> 01:05:23.971
I mean, that... that
we're going, too.

01:05:24.073 --> 01:05:25.032
Cool.

01:05:25.257 --> 01:05:28.224
Tell that punk to shut
the door. We're outta here.

01:05:28.329 --> 01:05:29.704
Go sniff around
somewhere else.

01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:30.760
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:05:35.783 --> 01:05:36.934
Uhh...

01:05:39.111 --> 01:05:41.020
It's Air Force One,
for crying out loud.

01:05:41.127 --> 01:05:42.082
Still he gets sick.

01:05:42.178 --> 01:05:44.126
Oh, boy.
I don't feel so good.

01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:45.987
Look at me, huh?
Like a rock.

01:05:46.087 --> 01:05:47.363
Could be bad weather,
could be good weather.

01:05:47.463 --> 01:05:48.478
It doesn't matter.

01:05:48.583 --> 01:05:49.860
We could go up.
We could go down.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.650
We can go back.
We can go forward.

01:05:51.751 --> 01:05:52.831
We can go
side to side...

01:05:55.911 --> 01:05:56.870
What'd I say?

01:05:58.919 --> 01:06:00.926
He still
gets airsick, huh?

01:06:01.032 --> 01:06:01.991
Yeah.

01:06:02.503 --> 01:06:05.601
Julius, with
all of this, I, uh...

01:06:05.703 --> 01:06:08.998
I didn't get a chance
to thank you two.

01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:11.234
All he could think of
was getting to you.

01:06:13.991 --> 01:06:16.130
There's still love there,
I think.

01:06:18.664 --> 01:06:20.452
Love was never
our problem.

01:06:20.551 --> 01:06:23.301
"All you need is love."

01:06:23.399 --> 01:06:24.414
John Lennon.

01:06:24.519 --> 01:06:25.534
Smart man.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.494
Shot in the back.
Very sad.

01:06:29.191 --> 01:06:30.598
We've moved
as many of our forces

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:32.288
away from our bases
as possible,

01:06:32.391 --> 01:06:34.693
but we've already
sustained heavy losses.

01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:36.613
I spoke with the joint chiefs
when they arrived at NORAD.

01:06:36.711 --> 01:06:39.100
They agree we must launch
a counteroffensive

01:06:39.207 --> 01:06:40.865
with a full
nuclear strike.

01:06:40.967 --> 01:06:42.429
Over American soil?

01:06:42.535 --> 01:06:43.550
You're saying,
at this point,

01:06:43.655 --> 01:06:44.833
we should sacrifice
more innocent

01:06:44.936 --> 01:06:46.758
American civilians?
Is that right?

01:06:46.856 --> 01:06:48.099
Sir, if we don't
strike soon

01:06:48.199 --> 01:06:49.988
there may not be much
of an America left to defend.

01:06:50.088 --> 01:06:51.975
Sir, they've
taken out NORAD.

01:06:52.071 --> 01:06:53.017
What?

01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:54.045
It's gone, sir.

01:06:54.141 --> 01:06:55.462
My God.

01:06:55.975 --> 01:06:58.342
The vice president,
joint chiefs.

01:06:58.439 --> 01:07:00.806
Mr. President,

01:07:00.904 --> 01:07:02.333
we must launch.

01:07:02.439 --> 01:07:03.966
A delay now
would be more costly

01:07:04.071 --> 01:07:06.821
than when you waited
to evacuate the cities.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.381
No, no. You're not going
to launch nuclear weapons.

01:07:08.487 --> 01:07:10.461
You're going to kill them
and us at the same time.

01:07:10.567 --> 01:07:11.909
If we fire nukes,

01:07:12.007 --> 01:07:12.954
then everybody else
is going to fire them.

01:07:13.050 --> 01:07:13.970
You are a guest here.

01:07:14.065 --> 01:07:14.965
Ever hear of
nuclear winter?

01:07:15.061 --> 01:07:16.675
It's the end of life
as we know it.

01:07:16.775 --> 01:07:17.721
Do you hear what
they're talking about?

01:07:17.817 --> 01:07:18.728
Don't even think
about it.

01:07:18.824 --> 01:07:19.721
I don't have to go.

01:07:19.817 --> 01:07:20.737
It can't be allowed.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:22.433
Shut up! Captain,
get him out of here!

01:07:22.535 --> 01:07:23.615
Hey, don't tell him
to shut up!

01:07:25.639 --> 01:07:28.770
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David.

01:07:28.871 --> 01:07:30.431
None of you did anything
to prevent this.

01:07:30.535 --> 01:07:31.779
There was nothing
we could do.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.116
We were totally
unprepared for this.

01:07:34.215 --> 01:07:35.524
Aw! Don't give me
unprepared.

01:07:35.623 --> 01:07:36.582
Come on, Julius.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.429
It was in the 1950s.
You had that spaceship.

01:07:39.527 --> 01:07:40.678
Dad.

01:07:40.967 --> 01:07:43.618
Yeah, that thing
that you found in New Mexico.

01:07:43.719 --> 01:07:45.824
Dad, no.
Not the spaceship.

01:07:45.927 --> 01:07:47.137
Roswell.
Roswell, New Mexico. Yeah.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.606
You had the spaceship,
and you had the bodies.

01:07:49.703 --> 01:07:50.718
They were all
locked up in a bunker.

01:07:50.824 --> 01:07:51.936
Where was that?

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.527
David?
In Area 51, right?

01:07:54.631 --> 01:07:55.973
Area 51.

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.827
You knew then,
and you did nothing.

01:07:59.303 --> 01:08:00.645
Sir, regardless of what

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:03.743
you may have read
in the tabloids,

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:05.822
there have never been
any spacecraft

01:08:05.927 --> 01:08:07.683
recovered
by our government.

01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:10.401
Take my word for it,
there's no Area 51.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:12.358
There's no
recovered spaceship.

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:15.455
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. President?

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:19.301
That's not
entirely accurate.

01:08:23.943 --> 01:08:26.560
What? Which part?

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:33.859
Hold on, everybody!
Hold on!

01:08:35.046 --> 01:08:36.197
Sorry.

01:08:53.638 --> 01:08:55.493
The end hath come!

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:59.005
He spaketh His word,
and the end hath come!

01:08:59.109 --> 01:09:00.057
Hop on!

01:09:00.153 --> 01:09:02.307
We're heading out
to El Toro.

01:09:02.406 --> 01:09:05.952
You cannot defy
what hath come.

01:09:06.053 --> 01:09:07.515
It is the end!

01:09:12.934 --> 01:09:14.660
El Toro?!

01:09:20.981 --> 01:09:22.803
Can you
give me a hand?

01:09:22.901 --> 01:09:23.916
Yeah, sure.

01:09:31.573 --> 01:09:32.533
Oh, my God.

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.261
OK, OK. Let's...
Let's get this off.

01:09:41.365 --> 01:09:42.926
Here. Let me help you.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.404
She's hurt
pretty badly.

01:09:52.212 --> 01:09:56.490
You know, this was supposed
to be my weekend off.

01:09:56.598 --> 01:09:57.940
But no.

01:09:58.901 --> 01:10:01.716
You got me out here
dragging your heavy ass

01:10:01.813 --> 01:10:03.275
through
the burning desert,

01:10:03.381 --> 01:10:04.723
with your dreadlocks

01:10:04.822 --> 01:10:05.999
sticking out the back
of my parachute.

01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:08.883
You've got to come down here
with an attitude,

01:10:08.981 --> 01:10:10.956
acting all big and bad.

01:10:13.014 --> 01:10:16.047
And what the hell
is that smell?!

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:17.109
Aah!

01:10:19.573 --> 01:10:21.068
I could've been
at a barbecue!

01:10:22.774 --> 01:10:23.919
But I ain't mad.

01:10:24.022 --> 01:10:25.876
It's all right.

01:10:25.973 --> 01:10:27.402
That is all right.

01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:42.964
Hey!

01:10:43.221 --> 01:10:44.181
Hey!

01:10:45.109 --> 01:10:46.068
Hey!

01:10:51.318 --> 01:10:52.277
Hey!

01:11:04.758 --> 01:11:06.830
You need a lift,
soldier?

01:11:06.934 --> 01:11:08.243
When I flew overhead,

01:11:08.342 --> 01:11:09.803
I saw a base
not too far from here.

01:11:12.917 --> 01:11:13.876
It ain't on the map.

01:11:13.973 --> 01:11:17.039
Trust me. It's there.

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:33.166
Ten-hut!

01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:39.088
Mr. President.
General.

01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:40.847
Welcome to Area 51.

01:11:40.949 --> 01:11:41.931
Please follow me.

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:45.871
We're now 24 floors
beneath the surface,

01:11:45.973 --> 01:11:48.690
and here's our main
research facility.

01:11:48.789 --> 01:11:49.748
Let's see it.

01:11:49.845 --> 01:11:50.804
I'm sorry, sir.
It's a clean room.

01:11:50.901 --> 01:11:52.111
We have to keep it
static-free.

01:11:52.213 --> 01:11:53.163
If we'll all
go to decontamination...

01:11:53.259 --> 01:11:55.344
Open the door.

01:11:57.237 --> 01:11:58.350
Yes, sir.

01:12:18.965 --> 01:12:21.965
My God. Why the hell wasn't
I told about this place?

01:12:22.069 --> 01:12:23.563
Two words,
Mr. President:

01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:26.419
plausible
deniability.

01:12:32.661 --> 01:12:34.156
I don't understand.

01:12:34.261 --> 01:12:35.603
Where does all this
come from?

01:12:35.702 --> 01:12:38.003
How do you get funding
for something like this?

01:12:38.101 --> 01:12:39.443
You don't actually think

01:12:39.542 --> 01:12:40.785
they spend $20,000
on a hammer,

01:12:40.885 --> 01:12:43.252
$30,000 on a toilet seat,
do you?

01:12:45.302 --> 01:12:47.691
Mr. President,
this is Dr. Okun.

01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:48.909
He's been heading up
the research department

01:12:49.013 --> 01:12:50.988
on this project
for the last 15 years.

01:12:53.173 --> 01:12:54.580
How do you do.

01:12:54.677 --> 01:12:57.361
Mr. President.

01:12:57.461 --> 01:12:58.420
Wow.

01:12:59.637 --> 01:13:03.282
This...
What a pleasure.

01:13:03.381 --> 01:13:05.072
As you can imagine,

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:06.766
they don't let us
out much.

01:13:08.309 --> 01:13:10.000
I can understand that.

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:14.612
Well, I guess
you'd like to see

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:16.619
the big tamale, huh?

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:18.035
Follow me.

01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:09.010
She's a beaut,
ain't she?

01:14:11.349 --> 01:14:12.309
As you can see
from the repairs,

01:14:12.405 --> 01:14:14.031
we've been trying
to put her back together

01:14:14.134 --> 01:14:16.435
since the late 1960s.

01:14:16.533 --> 01:14:17.548
Don't tell me

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:18.604
you've had this
for 40 years,

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.623
and you don't know
anything about them?

01:14:19.719 --> 01:14:20.750
Oh, hell, no. No, no.

01:14:20.854 --> 01:14:22.893
We know tons about them.

01:14:22.997 --> 01:14:24.720
But the neatest stuff...
the neatest stuff

01:14:24.821 --> 01:14:28.531
has only happened
in the last few days.

01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:30.866
See, we can't duplicate
their type of power,

01:14:30.965 --> 01:14:33.234
so we've never been able
to experiment.

01:14:33.334 --> 01:14:34.643
But since these guys
started showing up,

01:14:34.741 --> 01:14:38.898
all the little gizmos
inside turned on.

01:14:38.997 --> 01:14:41.779
The last 24 hours have
been really exciting.

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:44.146
Exciting?
People are dying out there.

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:45.555
I don't think "exciting"

01:14:45.653 --> 01:14:48.468
is the word I'd choose
to describe it.

01:14:48.565 --> 01:14:50.572
You guys are hoping
to fly this thing, huh?

01:14:50.677 --> 01:14:52.913
You said you can repair
their technology.

01:14:53.013 --> 01:14:54.704
Can you tell us anything
useful about them?

01:14:54.805 --> 01:14:56.234
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:56.341 --> 01:14:57.683
Well, I mean,

01:14:57.781 --> 01:14:59.636
they're not all that
dissimilar from us.

01:14:59.733 --> 01:15:01.588
Breathes oxygen.

01:15:01.685 --> 01:15:03.856
Comparable tolerances
to heat, cold.

01:15:03.957 --> 01:15:05.298
Probably why
they're interested

01:15:05.397 --> 01:15:07.502
in our planet.

01:15:07.605 --> 01:15:08.564
Hey.

01:15:09.173 --> 01:15:10.132
Hey.

01:15:12.405 --> 01:15:13.615
You guys
want to see them?

01:15:14.965 --> 01:15:15.925
Hmm?

01:15:23.125 --> 01:15:26.987
This is...
This is the vault,

01:15:27.093 --> 01:15:30.574
or as some of us have
come to call it,

01:15:30.677 --> 01:15:31.628
"The Freak Show."

01:15:31.724 --> 01:15:33.938
Ha ha ha ha ha.

01:15:34.037 --> 01:15:34.996
"The..."

01:15:53.365 --> 01:15:55.373
When we found them,

01:15:55.477 --> 01:15:59.252
they were wearing some sort
of biomechanical suits,

01:15:59.349 --> 01:16:00.308
but once we got them off,

01:16:00.405 --> 01:16:02.445
we learned a great deal
about their anatomy.

01:16:02.549 --> 01:16:05.964
Eyes, ears,
no vocal chords.

01:16:06.069 --> 01:16:08.011
We're assuming they
communicate with each other

01:16:08.117 --> 01:16:09.808
through some other means.

01:16:09.909 --> 01:16:10.924
You're obviously
not thinking about

01:16:11.029 --> 01:16:13.168
hand signals
and body language.

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:14.216
It's
some kind of

01:16:14.312 --> 01:16:15.985
extrasensory
perception.

01:16:16.085 --> 01:16:17.362
Telepathy.

01:16:18.613 --> 01:16:19.572
So...

01:16:21.653 --> 01:16:23.693
It's an organic life form.

01:16:25.621 --> 01:16:28.490
Can they be killed?

01:16:28.597 --> 01:16:30.190
Their bodies are
just as frail as ours.

01:16:30.293 --> 01:16:32.301
These two
died in the crash.

01:16:32.405 --> 01:16:34.642
This one,
a few weeks later.

01:16:34.741 --> 01:16:35.723
You just...

01:16:35.829 --> 01:16:37.771
You have to get through
their technology,

01:16:37.877 --> 01:16:40.627
which is,
I'm sorry to say,

01:16:40.725 --> 01:16:41.837
far more advanced.

01:16:43.125 --> 01:16:46.508
David, you unlocked
part of that technology.

01:16:46.613 --> 01:16:47.595
You cracked the code.

01:16:47.701 --> 01:16:48.651
Oh, no, no.

01:16:48.747 --> 01:16:51.115
All I did was stumble
onto their signal.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:54.068
I don't know
how helpful I can be.

01:16:54.165 --> 01:16:58.027
Why don't you show them
what you've discovered so far,

01:16:58.133 --> 01:17:01.330
figure out what they haven't
thought of yet,

01:17:01.429 --> 01:17:02.770
and we'll see

01:17:02.869 --> 01:17:05.935
if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

01:17:15.541 --> 01:17:16.882
What code?

01:17:36.213 --> 01:17:37.293
Captain Steven Hiller,

01:17:37.397 --> 01:17:38.412
United States
Marine Corps.

01:17:38.517 --> 01:17:40.589
I'm sorry, Captain.
This is a restricted area.

01:17:40.693 --> 01:17:41.969
I can't let you pass
without clearance.

01:17:42.069 --> 01:17:44.754
OK. Come here.

01:17:45.045 --> 01:17:46.670
You want to see
my clearance?

01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:51.041
Maybe I'll just leave
this here with you.

01:17:51.137 --> 01:17:52.096
Let them pass.

01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:54.349
Let them pass.

01:17:54.445 --> 01:17:56.412
Get the hell
out of the way.

01:17:58.019 --> 01:17:59.360
Did you see that?

01:17:59.459 --> 01:18:00.298
Come on down.

01:18:00.394 --> 01:18:01.233
Come on down.

01:18:02.402 --> 01:18:03.361
Watch your step.

01:18:04.867 --> 01:18:08.544
Well, obviously, this cockpit
was designed to seat three,

01:18:08.643 --> 01:18:11.032
though how they sat on that,
I don't know.

01:18:11.138 --> 01:18:12.085
Gently.

01:18:12.181 --> 01:18:14.520
Uh, you see
these gizmos flashing?

01:18:14.626 --> 01:18:15.573
Yeah.

01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:16.764
We've been working
around the clock

01:18:16.867 --> 01:18:18.689
trying to get a fix
on all this crap.

01:18:18.787 --> 01:18:20.380
Some stuff we
figured out right away.

01:18:20.482 --> 01:18:22.304
Uh, this,
we're pretty sure,

01:18:22.402 --> 01:18:24.857
is the life support
system for the cabin.

01:18:24.963 --> 01:18:26.337
And, uh,

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.377
this doohickey
is connected to...

01:18:28.482 --> 01:18:31.101
Oh... Well, it was

01:18:31.202 --> 01:18:32.413
connected
to the engine.

01:18:32.514 --> 01:18:34.424
Here.
Take that, will ya?

01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:38.011
Uh, these configurations,
uh...

01:18:39.746 --> 01:18:41.121
Well, to be honest,

01:18:41.219 --> 01:18:44.448
we... we... we don't know
what the hell this crap is.

01:18:44.546 --> 01:18:46.913
But this is
clearly what they use

01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:49.432
to guide and navigate
their craft.

01:18:49.538 --> 01:18:51.196
Ha ha. Neat, huh?

01:18:51.299 --> 01:18:53.274
That's very good.
Somebody grab my laptop there?

01:18:53.378 --> 01:18:56.826
Dr. Isaacs, can I just have
the computer inside there?

01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:58.873
See these patterns here?
They're repeating sequentially,

01:18:58.979 --> 01:19:00.670
just like
their countdown signal.

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:02.909
They're using that frequency
for computer communications.

01:19:03.011 --> 01:19:03.970
Huh?

01:19:04.163 --> 01:19:06.235
See? That's how they're
coordinating their ships.

01:19:06.339 --> 01:19:08.957
Huh. Ya know...

01:19:09.059 --> 01:19:11.480
you're really starting
to make us look bad.

01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:20.251
They got one!

01:19:20.354 --> 01:19:21.532
They got one alive!

01:19:21.634 --> 01:19:22.747
They got one. Alive.

01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:26.199
Jesus! Look, will you
be OK by yourself, Dave?

01:19:26.307 --> 01:19:27.649
Fine, Dr. Okun.

01:19:27.746 --> 01:19:29.121
Yeah... Uh, don't
touch anything.

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:34.113
Why is he always telling me
not to touch anything?

01:19:34.210 --> 01:19:36.283
Yeah. There.

01:19:37.571 --> 01:19:39.643
Oh... that's why.

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:50.749
Right here. We got her
in the back of the pickup.

01:19:55.138 --> 01:19:56.186
How you doin', sir.

01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:59.290
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:00.704
Guess who's comin'
to dinner.

01:20:00.803 --> 01:20:03.453
I need a doctor!

01:20:03.554 --> 01:20:05.343
I need a doctor!

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:08.181
Oh, boy.

01:20:08.277 --> 01:20:09.188
Oh, boy.

01:20:09.284 --> 01:20:10.160
How long has it been
unconscious?

01:20:10.256 --> 01:20:11.120
About three hours.

01:20:11.216 --> 01:20:12.089
Let's get him into
containment, stat.

01:20:12.184 --> 01:20:13.920
My son, he's very sick.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.447
He needs immediate
attention.

01:20:15.555 --> 01:20:16.501
He's drying out.

01:20:16.597 --> 01:20:17.791
I want him sprayed
down with saline.

01:20:17.891 --> 01:20:19.931
He has a problem with his
adrenal cortex.

01:20:20.034 --> 01:20:21.376
Please!

01:20:24.322 --> 01:20:26.045
If you don't do something
about it right now,

01:20:26.146 --> 01:20:27.093
my son will die!

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:28.448
OK! Just help him!

01:20:28.547 --> 01:20:31.264
OK. O'Haver, Miller,
you come with us.

01:20:31.362 --> 01:20:32.857
You take us to him,
OK?

01:20:32.962 --> 01:20:34.140
Let's go.

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:37.920
OK. Move it!
Move it! Move it!

01:20:39.459 --> 01:20:40.974
As the former head
of the C.I.A.,

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:42.029
you knew about this place.

01:20:43.632 --> 01:20:44.810
When were you planning on
informing the rest of us?

01:20:44.912 --> 01:20:46.537
It had been deemed
classified.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.982
You should have
told us about this

01:20:48.079 --> 01:20:49.421
when they first arrived.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.862
You should have warned us

01:20:50.959 --> 01:20:52.301
before we launched
a counterattack

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:55.018
that cost us the lives of
hundreds of American pilots!

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.070
There was no way

01:20:56.166 --> 01:20:57.086
we could have known
that our fighters

01:20:57.182 --> 01:20:58.058
would have been
that ineffective

01:20:58.154 --> 01:20:59.013
against their attackers.

01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:00.136
Mr. President.

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.476
The little bit
of information that we have

01:21:02.576 --> 01:21:04.715
comes directly into
this room, Mr. President.

01:21:04.816 --> 01:21:06.790
Atlanta, Chicago,
and Philadelphia...

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:08.073
destroyed.

01:21:08.176 --> 01:21:09.670
We've learned that NATO

01:21:09.776 --> 01:21:11.401
and Western Allied
Installations

01:21:11.504 --> 01:21:13.359
were the first
to be taken out.

01:21:13.456 --> 01:21:14.797
Then we were hit.

01:21:14.896 --> 01:21:17.930
They knew exactly
where and how to hit us.

01:21:18.032 --> 01:21:19.374
And our forces?

01:21:19.472 --> 01:21:21.294
We're down to 15%.

01:21:21.392 --> 01:21:23.399
If you calculate
the time it takes

01:21:23.503 --> 01:21:25.129
to destroy a city
and move on,

01:21:25.232 --> 01:21:27.533
we're looking at
the worldwide destruction

01:21:27.632 --> 01:21:29.705
of every major city...

01:21:29.808 --> 01:21:33.191
in the next 36 hours.

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:36.395
We're being exterminated.

01:21:39.344 --> 01:21:40.391
Mr. President.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.342
This is
Captain Steven Hiller.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.387
Captain.

01:21:44.482 --> 01:21:45.427
Mr. President.

01:21:45.523 --> 01:21:46.467
Well done.

01:21:46.563 --> 01:21:48.236
Where is it now?

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.678
We have it isolated

01:21:49.775 --> 01:21:51.117
down in the containment
lab, sir.

01:21:51.216 --> 01:21:52.809
I'd like to go see it.

01:21:58.192 --> 01:22:01.869
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

01:22:03.823 --> 01:22:05.579
Hasn't anyone told you?

01:22:08.528 --> 01:22:11.397
El Toro has been
completely destroyed.

01:22:58.928 --> 01:23:00.271
Oh, no.

01:23:01.616 --> 01:23:02.958
We were lucky.

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:06.381
Today was the first time
I used the subway.

01:23:06.479 --> 01:23:08.138
Thank God
for the metro rail.

01:23:08.239 --> 01:23:09.766
These should last us
a while.

01:23:09.872 --> 01:23:11.628
Don't move.
I'll get it for you.

01:23:11.727 --> 01:23:13.288
Stay still.

01:23:14.832 --> 01:23:17.199
He's your son?

01:23:17.295 --> 01:23:18.856
He's my angel.

01:23:18.959 --> 01:23:21.993
Was his father
stationed here?

01:23:22.095 --> 01:23:24.397
Nah, he, uh...

01:23:24.496 --> 01:23:26.318
he wasn't his father.

01:23:26.416 --> 01:23:27.758
But I was kind of hoping

01:23:27.855 --> 01:23:30.311
he wanted the job,
though.

01:23:32.847 --> 01:23:35.302
So what do you do
for a living?

01:23:35.408 --> 01:23:37.383
I'm a dancer.

01:23:37.488 --> 01:23:38.447
Ah.

01:23:38.767 --> 01:23:40.110
Ballet?

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.199
No.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.858
Exotic.

01:23:44.048 --> 01:23:45.007
Oh.

01:23:45.808 --> 01:23:46.959
Sorry.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:48.589
Don't be.

01:23:48.688 --> 01:23:49.670
I'm not.

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:51.117
It's good money.

01:23:51.216 --> 01:23:52.171
Besides,

01:23:52.267 --> 01:23:53.582
my baby's worth it.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:54.626
Dylan.

01:23:54.722 --> 01:23:55.633
Come here.

01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:58.382
I want you to meet
the first lady.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.439
Ohh.

01:24:01.999 --> 01:24:03.150
Hello.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.399
Hi.

01:24:04.879 --> 01:24:07.727
I didn't know
that you'd recognized me.

01:24:07.823 --> 01:24:09.646
Well, I didn't want
to say nothing.

01:24:09.743 --> 01:24:11.304
I voted for
the other guy.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.786
All right,

01:24:14.882 --> 01:24:16.141
life support
monitors recording.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.542
So if we screw up,
it's all on tape.

01:24:18.639 --> 01:24:19.785
OK, come on, come on.

01:24:19.887 --> 01:24:20.934
Let's get this biomechanical
suit off him.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.414
Put the spreader
right here.

01:24:22.511 --> 01:24:24.748
Right along
the ridge.

01:24:24.847 --> 01:24:26.603
Microprobe thingamajig
goes right here,

01:24:26.703 --> 01:24:28.045
pick there. Good.

01:24:28.144 --> 01:24:30.478
All right, now spread it
very, very gently.

01:24:30.576 --> 01:24:31.917
Let me get in.

01:24:32.015 --> 01:24:33.128
Uh-huh.

01:24:38.383 --> 01:24:41.001
Gentle, gentle.
That's it.

01:24:41.103 --> 01:24:43.885
That's right... easy.

01:24:50.096 --> 01:24:51.208
All right. OK.

01:24:51.311 --> 01:24:52.718
Let's proceed.

01:24:52.816 --> 01:24:55.183
Now comes the, uh,

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.392
the really icky part.

01:24:56.496 --> 01:24:57.455
Ugh.

01:24:58.959 --> 01:25:00.388
Oh, boy.

01:25:00.496 --> 01:25:01.957
This is one smelly,

01:25:02.064 --> 01:25:04.169
disgusting...

01:25:11.823 --> 01:25:13.067
Oh, look at it.

01:25:13.168 --> 01:25:16.266
It doesn't look alive,
does it?

01:25:19.632 --> 01:25:21.038
The arm is moving.

01:25:29.648 --> 01:25:30.583
Aah!

01:25:30.679 --> 01:25:31.578
Doctor!

01:25:31.674 --> 01:25:32.598
Aah!

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:33.679
Aah!

01:25:35.535 --> 01:25:36.494
Doctor! Doctor!

01:25:37.872 --> 01:25:38.818
Get it off!

01:25:38.914 --> 01:25:41.482
Don't move!
Don't move!

01:25:41.583 --> 01:25:42.696
Help me! Help me!

01:25:43.984 --> 01:25:44.943
Aah!

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.399
Aah!

01:25:48.559 --> 01:25:50.534
Open up that door!

01:25:50.639 --> 01:25:51.982
My God!

01:26:23.631 --> 01:26:24.776
Dr. Okun.

01:26:50.544 --> 01:26:51.721
Open the door.
Get him out of there.

01:26:51.823 --> 01:26:52.782
No, wait.

01:27:06.479 --> 01:27:08.589
Release me.

01:27:12.399 --> 01:27:13.358
Now!

01:27:21.008 --> 01:27:22.830
I know there is much

01:27:22.928 --> 01:27:24.684
we can learn
from each other

01:27:24.783 --> 01:27:27.566
if we can negotiate
a truce.

01:27:27.663 --> 01:27:30.446
We can find a way
to coexist.

01:27:30.543 --> 01:27:33.096
Can there be a peace
between us?

01:27:33.199 --> 01:27:34.350
Peace?

01:27:36.655 --> 01:27:38.382
No peace.

01:27:45.264 --> 01:27:47.369
What is it
you want us to do?

01:27:49.552 --> 01:27:50.511
Die.

01:28:00.368 --> 01:28:01.518
Die...

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:04.686
Uh! Uh!

01:28:04.847 --> 01:28:06.382
Uh! Aah!

01:28:07.055 --> 01:28:08.582
Mr. President...

01:28:08.687 --> 01:28:10.662
Is that glass
bulletproof?

01:28:10.767 --> 01:28:12.302
No, sir.

01:28:12.559 --> 01:28:13.518
Ah!

01:28:30.832 --> 01:28:32.871
Are you all right?

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:34.317
I saw his thoughts.

01:28:34.415 --> 01:28:37.263
I saw what
they're planning to do.

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:40.589
They're like locusts.

01:28:40.688 --> 01:28:44.233
They're moving
from planet to planet,

01:28:44.336 --> 01:28:45.994
their
whole civilization.

01:28:46.096 --> 01:28:48.365
After they've consumed
every natural resource,

01:28:48.463 --> 01:28:50.957
they move on.

01:28:51.919 --> 01:28:53.380
And we're next.

01:29:04.336 --> 01:29:05.830
Nuke 'em.

01:29:07.023 --> 01:29:09.194
Let's nuke the bastards.

01:29:20.111 --> 01:29:23.111
Just my luck.
No ice.

01:29:23.215 --> 01:29:25.354
I take it you've heard.

01:29:25.456 --> 01:29:27.594
Hey, a toast.

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:29.767
To the end
of the world.

01:29:29.871 --> 01:29:32.238
He didn't come to
this decision lightly.

01:29:32.336 --> 01:29:34.092
He didn't have
any other choice.

01:29:34.191 --> 01:29:35.138
Yeah.

01:29:35.234 --> 01:29:37.355
You still believe in him.

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:39.430
Yeah. Well,
he's a good man.

01:29:39.535 --> 01:29:40.877
Whoa... ha ha.

01:29:40.976 --> 01:29:42.317
He better be.

01:29:42.415 --> 01:29:44.237
You left me for him.

01:29:44.335 --> 01:29:46.604
Or, you know,
for your... career.

01:29:46.703 --> 01:29:48.525
You know, it wasn't
just my... career.

01:29:48.623 --> 01:29:51.558
It was the biggest
opportunity of my life.

01:29:51.663 --> 01:29:53.965
I wanted my life
to make a difference.

01:29:54.063 --> 01:29:56.364
I wanted my life
to mean something.

01:29:56.463 --> 01:29:57.805
Yeah, and, um,
hmm,

01:29:57.903 --> 01:29:58.885
I wasn't, um...

01:29:58.991 --> 01:30:00.202
ambitious enough
for you?

01:30:00.303 --> 01:30:02.824
David, you could have done
anything that you wanted.

01:30:02.927 --> 01:30:03.874
Research,

01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:05.065
development...

01:30:05.168 --> 01:30:06.760
Oh, honey, I was
happy where I was.

01:30:06.863 --> 01:30:08.205
Haven't you ever wanted

01:30:08.304 --> 01:30:12.427
to be part of something
special?

01:30:12.527 --> 01:30:15.178
I was part
of something special.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.981
Well, if it makes
any difference,

01:30:32.079 --> 01:30:33.835
I never stopped
loving you.

01:30:33.935 --> 01:30:37.164
But that wasn't enough,
was it?

01:30:54.063 --> 01:30:56.365
Let's pick it up,
men.

01:30:56.463 --> 01:30:59.245
We're on a tight schedule,
now. Let's go.

01:31:03.183 --> 01:31:05.005
Let's pick it up, men.

01:31:05.103 --> 01:31:06.412
We're working on
a tight schedule. Let's go!

01:31:06.512 --> 01:31:09.228
Pick it up, man!
Pick it up!

01:31:12.687 --> 01:31:13.963
What the hell
are you doing?

01:31:14.063 --> 01:31:15.918
Get out of there!

01:31:16.016 --> 01:31:17.357
Look, I got something
I got to handle.

01:31:17.455 --> 01:31:18.535
I'm just borrowing it.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:19.752
No, you're not, sir.

01:31:19.919 --> 01:31:22.221
Do you really
want to shoot me?

01:31:24.303 --> 01:31:25.896
Just tell them
I hit you.

01:31:31.599 --> 01:31:33.159
Command,
this is Retel Op.

01:31:33.263 --> 01:31:35.172
The squadron
is in the air.

01:31:35.279 --> 01:31:37.646
We are on station and
awaiting instructions.

01:31:37.743 --> 01:31:39.401
Roger. Break formation,
head to targets.

01:31:43.343 --> 01:31:44.494
Sir...

01:31:45.071 --> 01:31:46.597
they're breaking formation.

01:31:46.703 --> 01:31:49.256
Mr. President,
we're initiating sequence code.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.701
Verification,

01:31:50.799 --> 01:31:51.754
Alpha Zulu 6-8-9er.

01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:53.547
Which city will be
reached first?

01:31:53.647 --> 01:31:54.594
Houston, Texas.

01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:56.909
ETA six minutes
and counting down.

01:31:57.007 --> 01:31:57.953
Houston.

01:31:58.049 --> 01:31:59.822
The major cities
have been deserted.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:04.327
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.095
Command,
this is Neighborhood Watch.

01:32:09.199 --> 01:32:10.541
We are in position.

01:32:10.639 --> 01:32:13.028
Tracking monitors
are locked on.

01:32:13.135 --> 01:32:15.437
We are going
to visual recon.

01:32:15.536 --> 01:32:17.445
Roger that, TCW.

01:32:21.103 --> 01:32:22.117
They have confirmation.

01:32:22.223 --> 01:32:23.368
Launch code confirmed.

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.609
Alpha Zulu 6-8-9er.

01:32:25.711 --> 01:32:27.205
Standing by.

01:32:29.039 --> 01:32:32.108
Laser targeting.

01:32:32.303 --> 01:32:33.710
Locked on.

01:32:33.807 --> 01:32:35.149
We're locked on, sir.

01:32:35.247 --> 01:32:37.035
Do you wish to deploy?

01:32:40.079 --> 01:32:42.861
Mr. President,
if you wish to deploy,

01:32:42.959 --> 01:32:44.781
the time is now.

01:32:49.615 --> 01:32:51.175
Mr. President.

01:32:51.279 --> 01:32:52.326
Deploy.

01:32:52.431 --> 01:32:53.772
That's a go.

01:32:53.871 --> 01:32:55.180
Alpha Zulu 6-8-9er,
that is a go.

01:32:55.279 --> 01:32:56.588
Here we go.

01:33:04.591 --> 01:33:06.053
Bird's away.

01:33:06.159 --> 01:33:07.982
We have visual confirmation
of the missile.

01:33:08.079 --> 01:33:09.127
It's on target...

01:33:09.231 --> 01:33:11.336
approaching...

01:33:11.439 --> 01:33:12.999
May our children
forgive us.

01:33:13.103 --> 01:33:15.045
5 seconds to impact.

01:33:15.151 --> 01:33:16.086
3...

01:33:16.182 --> 01:33:17.117
2...

01:33:17.231 --> 01:33:18.190
1...

01:33:20.367 --> 01:33:22.025
Oh, yeah, it's a hit!

01:33:26.063 --> 01:33:27.438
Lock it down!

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:28.779
I said lock it down!

01:33:28.879 --> 01:33:31.497
Can I confirm that
the target was destroyed?

01:33:31.599 --> 01:33:33.421
Get the tank commander
on the line.

01:33:33.519 --> 01:33:35.374
I want confirmation that
the target was destroyed.

01:33:35.471 --> 01:33:36.485
Yes, sir. Red Arrow
Alpha 9er 7-2-3,

01:33:36.591 --> 01:33:37.550
can you read?

01:33:38.831 --> 01:33:39.976
Repeat, Commander,
you're breaking up.

01:33:40.079 --> 01:33:41.672
We have lost visual.

01:33:41.775 --> 01:33:43.019
Roger that.

01:33:43.119 --> 01:33:44.712
We're looking
for confirmation.

01:33:50.703 --> 01:33:52.590
We got the bastards.

01:33:52.687 --> 01:33:53.996
Yeah! Good job,
everyone.

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:55.469
Congratulations.

01:33:56.719 --> 01:33:58.345
Commander,
do you have visual?

01:33:58.447 --> 01:34:00.836
I repeat, we need
visual confirmation.

01:34:00.943 --> 01:34:02.469
Has the target
been destroyed?

01:34:16.303 --> 01:34:17.285
Negative.

01:34:19.663 --> 01:34:22.281
Target remains.

01:34:23.919 --> 01:34:25.927
I repeat...

01:34:26.031 --> 01:34:28.300
target remains.

01:34:30.991 --> 01:34:32.814
Call the other
planes back.

01:34:32.911 --> 01:34:35.050
One of the bombers
might have more luck.

01:34:35.151 --> 01:34:36.558
Sir, we shouldn't
just give up on this!

01:34:36.655 --> 01:34:38.827
I said call them back.

01:34:41.487 --> 01:34:42.434
Abort.

01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:44.007
All right, abort mission.

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:45.453
Issue the abort codes
right away.

01:34:45.551 --> 01:34:47.045
This is an abort.
Full abort.

01:34:47.151 --> 01:34:49.158
Do you read?
Abort mission right away.

01:35:24.943 --> 01:35:26.285
Jasmine?

01:35:30.607 --> 01:35:32.333
Yes. Yes!

01:35:38.511 --> 01:35:39.787
You're late.

01:35:39.887 --> 01:35:42.887
Well, you know I like
to make an entrance.

01:35:50.063 --> 01:35:51.307
Right this way.

01:35:51.407 --> 01:35:52.585
Where are we going?

01:35:52.687 --> 01:35:53.865
Right through there,
sir.

01:35:53.967 --> 01:35:54.981
Mr. President,

01:35:55.087 --> 01:35:56.069
your wife is
resting comfortably

01:35:56.175 --> 01:35:57.222
at the moment.

01:35:57.327 --> 01:35:58.309
Great.

01:35:58.415 --> 01:36:00.389
Perhaps if we had
gotten to her earlier...

01:36:00.495 --> 01:36:02.088
Hey, there she is.
Go on.

01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:05.612
She doesn't look too good.

01:36:05.711 --> 01:36:06.987
Your wife is
bleeding internally,

01:36:07.087 --> 01:36:08.041
Mr. President.
Perhaps if we'd

01:36:08.137 --> 01:36:09.834
gotten to her
earlier...

01:36:09.935 --> 01:36:12.236
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

01:36:12.335 --> 01:36:14.157
We can't stop
the bleeding.

01:36:14.255 --> 01:36:15.684
If we'd...

01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:19.052
There's nothing
we can do for her.

01:36:19.151 --> 01:36:20.744
We were worried.

01:36:20.846 --> 01:36:23.148
We didn't know
where you were.

01:36:23.247 --> 01:36:25.102
I didn't know
where I was either.

01:36:27.823 --> 01:36:30.408
You got bigger,
I think.

01:36:30.511 --> 01:36:31.662
I did?

01:36:32.110 --> 01:36:33.453
Mm-hmm.

01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:36.747
Just keep growing
and growing.

01:36:38.191 --> 01:36:40.078
I can't...

01:36:41.839 --> 01:36:42.798
Hey.

01:36:43.278 --> 01:36:46.061
Can you, uh, wait outside
for a little bit

01:36:46.158 --> 01:36:47.817
so Mom can get a rest?

01:36:47.919 --> 01:36:49.326
Hey.
Come on, munchkin.

01:36:57.615 --> 01:37:00.332
I'm so sorry
that I didn't come home

01:37:00.431 --> 01:37:02.253
when you asked me to.

01:37:02.351 --> 01:37:03.502
Ohh...

01:37:03.983 --> 01:37:04.930
Ohh...

01:37:05.026 --> 01:37:05.973
It's OK.

01:37:08.238 --> 01:37:10.627
The doctors...

01:37:10.735 --> 01:37:12.709
think that you're...

01:37:12.815 --> 01:37:15.237
gonna be just fine.

01:37:17.615 --> 01:37:18.574
Liar.

01:38:13.231 --> 01:38:15.173
Is Mommy sleeping now?

01:38:16.815 --> 01:38:18.157
Yeah...

01:38:19.630 --> 01:38:21.867
Mommy's sleeping.

01:38:24.719 --> 01:38:25.678
Hey.

01:38:56.079 --> 01:38:57.229
David!

01:38:57.422 --> 01:38:59.015
What the hell
are you doing?

01:38:59.119 --> 01:39:00.974
I'm making a mess!

01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:02.597
Yeah, this I can see.

01:39:02.703 --> 01:39:04.263
We gotta burn
the rain forest,

01:39:04.367 --> 01:39:05.479
dump toxic waste,

01:39:05.583 --> 01:39:07.884
pollute the air,
and rip up the ozone,

01:39:07.982 --> 01:39:09.324
'cause maybe if we

01:39:09.423 --> 01:39:11.245
screw this planet up
enough...

01:39:11.343 --> 01:39:13.066
they won't want it
anymore.

01:39:13.167 --> 01:39:14.181
Wait, wait, wait.
David, David!

01:39:14.287 --> 01:39:15.629
Don't do this
to yourself.

01:39:15.726 --> 01:39:16.709
Listen to me.

01:39:16.815 --> 01:39:18.025
Are you listening
to me?

01:39:18.127 --> 01:39:19.469
Everyone loses faith

01:39:19.566 --> 01:39:21.127
at some point
in their life.

01:39:21.230 --> 01:39:23.434
David, look at myself.

01:39:23.535 --> 01:39:27.310
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

01:39:29.487 --> 01:39:30.446
Yes.

01:39:32.623 --> 01:39:33.965
But see, sometimes,

01:39:34.062 --> 01:39:36.877
we have to remember
what we still have.

01:39:36.975 --> 01:39:38.893
Like what?

01:39:42.063 --> 01:39:43.404
Well...

01:39:43.502 --> 01:39:45.128
you still have
your health.

01:39:46.671 --> 01:39:49.060
Come on, David, David.
You need your rest.

01:39:49.166 --> 01:39:50.955
Come on. Get off
this freezing concrete floor

01:39:51.055 --> 01:39:52.001
before you catch cold.

01:39:52.097 --> 01:39:53.045
Come on.

01:39:54.767 --> 01:39:56.523
What did you just say?

01:39:56.623 --> 01:39:57.965
You mean about faith?

01:39:58.062 --> 01:39:59.404
Well, you see,

01:39:59.503 --> 01:40:00.615
a man can live
his entire life...

01:40:00.719 --> 01:40:02.061
After that.
The other part.

01:40:02.158 --> 01:40:03.105
What? What?

01:40:03.201 --> 01:40:05.126
I don't want you
to catch cold.

01:40:08.047 --> 01:40:09.006
Duh!

01:40:09.103 --> 01:40:10.445
What is that?

01:40:10.542 --> 01:40:11.524
What's the matter
with you?

01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:12.973
Genius.

01:40:14.638 --> 01:40:15.981
Genius?

01:40:16.111 --> 01:40:18.314
My dad... a total genius.

01:40:19.855 --> 01:40:21.196
Jim, wake up.

01:40:21.295 --> 01:40:23.117
We got work to do.

01:40:23.215 --> 01:40:25.419
Get everybody down here
right away.

01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:26.478
What?

01:40:29.038 --> 01:40:30.249
Look at that.

01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:31.692
Wow! Does that thing

01:40:31.791 --> 01:40:33.613
really fly
in outer space?

01:40:33.711 --> 01:40:35.053
It most certainly does.

01:40:35.150 --> 01:40:37.005
Sure doesn't
look like it.

01:40:37.103 --> 01:40:39.242
Hey,
they're here.

01:40:39.342 --> 01:40:40.684
All right, Connie,
what's this all about?

01:40:40.783 --> 01:40:41.830
I have no idea.

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:43.276
Get everybody
off of it.

01:40:43.375 --> 01:40:44.717
All right, everybody,
clear the platform.

01:40:44.815 --> 01:40:46.408
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:47.972
Major Mitchell,

01:40:48.078 --> 01:40:49.736
do you have
a pistol?

01:40:49.839 --> 01:40:51.181
- What?
- You got a gun?

01:40:51.279 --> 01:40:52.555
Sergeant,
your sidearm.

01:40:53.646 --> 01:40:54.988
See that, uh, Coke can

01:40:55.087 --> 01:40:56.909
on top of
the alien craft?

01:40:57.007 --> 01:40:59.178
Think you can
shoot that thing off?

01:40:59.279 --> 01:41:00.937
Do it. Shoot it.

01:41:01.039 --> 01:41:01.998
Sir?

01:41:02.542 --> 01:41:03.884
Go ahead.

01:41:09.743 --> 01:41:11.685
What the hell
are you doing?

01:41:11.790 --> 01:41:12.968
I'm sorry. My fault.

01:41:13.071 --> 01:41:14.118
My fault.

01:41:14.223 --> 01:41:16.165
That Coke can was protected
by the craft's shield,

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:18.125
and we can't penetrate
their defenses.

01:41:18.223 --> 01:41:19.717
We know that already.
What's your point?

01:41:19.822 --> 01:41:21.164
Right. My point is,

01:41:21.263 --> 01:41:22.222
if we can't beat
their defenses,

01:41:22.319 --> 01:41:24.206
then we gotta
get around them.

01:41:24.302 --> 01:41:27.717
Major, one more time.
Anytime.

01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:39.208
How did you
do that?

01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:41.317
I gave it a cold.

01:41:41.423 --> 01:41:44.205
I gave it a virus.

01:41:44.303 --> 01:41:46.343
A computer virus.

01:41:46.446 --> 01:41:47.397
Are you telling us

01:41:47.493 --> 01:41:48.617
you can send out
a signal

01:41:48.718 --> 01:41:50.660
that will disable
all their shields?

01:41:50.767 --> 01:41:51.781
That's right.

01:41:51.887 --> 01:41:53.545
Just like they used
our satellites against us,

01:41:53.647 --> 01:41:55.948
we can use their own
signal against them.

01:41:56.046 --> 01:41:58.828
If we plant a virus
into that mother ship,

01:41:58.926 --> 01:42:00.748
it's gonna then filter down

01:42:00.846 --> 01:42:02.537
into all the corresponding
ships below.

01:42:02.639 --> 01:42:04.461
I... I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

01:42:04.559 --> 01:42:05.900
Just how, exactly,

01:42:05.998 --> 01:42:07.340
do we infect
the mother ship

01:42:07.439 --> 01:42:08.780
with this virus?

01:42:08.878 --> 01:42:10.221
Well...

01:42:10.798 --> 01:42:12.227
we're going to, uh...

01:42:12.335 --> 01:42:13.676
have to, um, ahem,

01:42:13.774 --> 01:42:15.596
fly their alien craft
out of our atmosphere

01:42:15.694 --> 01:42:16.938
and dock with it.

01:42:17.039 --> 01:42:18.380
We can enter here,

01:42:18.478 --> 01:42:19.755
as shown in these
satellite photos.

01:42:19.854 --> 01:42:21.677
We then upload the virus.

01:42:21.774 --> 01:42:24.076
We then set off
some kind of explosion,

01:42:24.175 --> 01:42:25.517
which will disable it,

01:42:25.614 --> 01:42:26.956
and that'll disorient
the smaller ships below,

01:42:27.055 --> 01:42:29.837
and that could buy,
I think, at least some time

01:42:29.935 --> 01:42:31.080
to, uh...

01:42:31.183 --> 01:42:32.590
to take 'em...

01:42:32.686 --> 01:42:34.028
take 'em out.

01:42:34.127 --> 01:42:35.305
Take 'em down.

01:42:35.406 --> 01:42:36.353
Do your...

01:42:36.449 --> 01:42:37.360
do your stuff.

01:42:37.456 --> 01:42:38.668
This is ridiculous.

01:42:38.767 --> 01:42:41.068
How long would
their shields be down?

01:42:41.166 --> 01:42:42.125
Uh...

01:42:42.382 --> 01:42:44.804
I don't know.
A matter of minutes.

01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:46.733
You want us to
coordinate

01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:48.139
a massive
worldwide counterstrike

01:42:48.238 --> 01:42:49.994
with a window
of only a few minutes?

01:42:50.095 --> 01:42:52.462
With the shields down,
that might be possible.

01:42:52.559 --> 01:42:53.573
Oh, please.

01:42:53.679 --> 01:42:54.694
We don't have
the manpower

01:42:54.798 --> 01:42:55.753
or the resources

01:42:55.849 --> 01:42:57.644
to launch that kind
of a campaign.

01:42:57.742 --> 01:42:59.084
Not to mention

01:42:59.183 --> 01:43:00.129
that this whole
cockamamie plan

01:43:00.225 --> 01:43:01.899
is dependent
on a machine

01:43:01.999 --> 01:43:03.787
that no one
in this world

01:43:03.887 --> 01:43:04.833
is qualified
to operate.

01:43:04.929 --> 01:43:06.123
I wouldn't say that, sir.

01:43:06.222 --> 01:43:07.684
I've seen these things
in action,

01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:09.895
and I'm well aware of their
maneuvering capabilities.

01:43:09.999 --> 01:43:11.428
With your permission,
General,

01:43:11.534 --> 01:43:13.989
I'd like the opportunity
to try.

01:43:14.095 --> 01:43:16.713
That thing
is a wreck.

01:43:16.815 --> 01:43:19.204
Crash-landed
back in the fifties.

01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:20.652
We don't even know

01:43:20.751 --> 01:43:22.027
if it's capable
of flying.

01:43:22.127 --> 01:43:24.014
Jim, uh, remove the clamps.

01:43:45.550 --> 01:43:46.925
Any questions?

01:43:51.279 --> 01:43:52.839
Let's do it.

01:43:56.718 --> 01:43:57.678
You heard
the president.

01:43:57.774 --> 01:43:58.952
Let's get this thing
prepped and ready.

01:43:59.055 --> 01:44:00.069
Good luck, pilot.

01:44:00.175 --> 01:44:01.866
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:44:01.966 --> 01:44:03.501
A virus.

01:44:03.855 --> 01:44:05.677
Your idea.

01:44:05.775 --> 01:44:07.236
That's right.

01:44:13.103 --> 01:44:14.444
You really think

01:44:14.542 --> 01:44:16.036
you can
fly that thing?

01:44:16.142 --> 01:44:17.484
You really think

01:44:17.582 --> 01:44:20.844
you can do all that bullshit
you just said?

01:44:26.414 --> 01:44:27.373
Hoo.

01:44:28.398 --> 01:44:29.740
I understand
you are upset

01:44:29.838 --> 01:44:31.180
over the death
of your wife,

01:44:31.278 --> 01:44:32.620
but that's no excuse

01:44:32.718 --> 01:44:33.798
for making another
fatal mistake.

01:44:33.902 --> 01:44:35.495
The only mistake
I ever made

01:44:35.598 --> 01:44:37.289
was to appoint a sniveling
little weasel like you

01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:38.341
as secretary of defense.

01:44:38.437 --> 01:44:39.691
I don't think
you understand...

01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:42.507
However, that is one mistake
I'm thankful to say

01:44:42.607 --> 01:44:44.908
that I don't have to
live with.

01:44:45.006 --> 01:44:46.184
Mr. President...

01:44:46.286 --> 01:44:48.109
Mr. Nimziki... you're fired.

01:44:51.022 --> 01:44:53.324
Let's organize every plane
we can find

01:44:53.423 --> 01:44:55.976
and get us some
goddamn pilots to fly 'em.

01:44:56.078 --> 01:44:57.025
Yes, sir.

01:44:57.121 --> 01:44:58.599
He can't do that.

01:44:58.702 --> 01:45:00.263
Well, he just, uh...

01:45:00.366 --> 01:45:01.325
did.

01:45:04.079 --> 01:45:05.355
Command has attempted

01:45:05.455 --> 01:45:06.796
to compile a list
of casualties and losses,

01:45:06.894 --> 01:45:09.196
but information
is sketchy at best.

01:45:09.295 --> 01:45:10.636
Well, we know we've lost

01:45:10.734 --> 01:45:12.425
the Belgian contingent
in the Sinai.

01:45:12.527 --> 01:45:13.868
There's a strong
possibility

01:45:13.966 --> 01:45:15.308
there may be
more reinforcements

01:45:15.407 --> 01:45:17.229
hiding
in the Golan Strait.

01:45:19.118 --> 01:45:20.460
What the hell's
he saying?

01:45:20.559 --> 01:45:21.868
It seems
they're getting a signal.

01:45:21.967 --> 01:45:22.926
Old Morse code.

01:45:34.862 --> 01:45:36.650
It's from
the Americans.

01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:40.332
They want to organize
a counteroffensive.

01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:41.772
It's about bloody time.

01:45:41.871 --> 01:45:43.780
What do they plan to do?

01:46:05.102 --> 01:46:07.590
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions

01:46:07.695 --> 01:46:09.734
in Europe, the Middle East,
and Asia.

01:46:09.838 --> 01:46:10.797
That's impressive,

01:46:10.894 --> 01:46:13.447
considering it's all
being done with, uh...

01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:14.761
Morse code.

01:46:14.862 --> 01:46:16.204
Are our forces here?

01:46:16.302 --> 01:46:17.644
We have sufficient
aircraft

01:46:17.742 --> 01:46:18.888
for the battle plan,
but...

01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.937
But what, General?

01:46:20.033 --> 01:46:21.892
Pilots are
coming up short.

01:46:21.999 --> 01:46:23.340
Well, then find 'em.

01:46:23.438 --> 01:46:26.504
Ham radio operators
from New York to Japan

01:46:26.606 --> 01:46:28.515
trade rumors of military
forces in hiding,

01:46:28.622 --> 01:46:31.851
unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation...

01:46:33.486 --> 01:46:35.242
What we're planning
at this time

01:46:35.342 --> 01:46:36.288
is to launch
a counteroffensive.

01:46:36.384 --> 01:46:37.578
However,
with our depleted manpower,

01:46:37.678 --> 01:46:39.020
we're asking that anyone

01:46:39.118 --> 01:46:40.428
with any flight experience
come forward.

01:46:40.526 --> 01:46:41.868
Military training
is preferable,

01:46:41.966 --> 01:46:45.959
but anyone who can fly
a plane would be useful.

01:46:46.062 --> 01:46:47.404
I can fly.

01:46:47.502 --> 01:46:49.029
I'm a pilot.

01:46:50.862 --> 01:46:52.684
All right, guys,
listen up.

01:46:52.782 --> 01:46:54.604
All right,
pay close attention.

01:46:54.702 --> 01:46:56.044
These F-18s
are very different

01:46:56.142 --> 01:46:57.419
than the jets
you've piloted before.

01:46:57.519 --> 01:46:58.566
It's kind of strong.

01:46:58.670 --> 01:47:00.012
You'll have to forgive
the expression,

01:47:00.110 --> 01:47:01.157
but you're about to get

01:47:01.262 --> 01:47:02.439
a crash course
in modern avionics.

01:47:02.542 --> 01:47:04.265
Ugh! Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.

01:47:04.366 --> 01:47:05.321
OK. You got it.

01:47:05.417 --> 01:47:07.278
All right, listen up.
Before we can begin,

01:47:07.375 --> 01:47:08.716
we're going
to have to get

01:47:08.814 --> 01:47:10.156
a little background
information

01:47:10.255 --> 01:47:11.214
on your flight experience.

01:47:11.311 --> 01:47:12.871
Uh, let's start with you.

01:47:12.975 --> 01:47:13.925
Who, me?

01:47:14.021 --> 01:47:14.972
Uh...

01:47:15.534 --> 01:47:18.087
Well, I'm, uh, ahem,
Russell Casse, sir.

01:47:18.190 --> 01:47:19.531
Um... and, uh,

01:47:19.630 --> 01:47:23.558
after 'Nam, I, uh,
got into crop-dusting.

01:47:23.662 --> 01:47:26.793
And, uh, been doing
that ever since.

01:47:26.894 --> 01:47:29.228
Oh, and on a, uh,
personal note, sir,

01:47:29.326 --> 01:47:32.010
I'd just like to add
that, uh...

01:47:32.110 --> 01:47:33.866
ever since I was
kidnapped by aliens

01:47:33.966 --> 01:47:35.395
10 years ago,

01:47:35.502 --> 01:47:37.477
I've been dying
for some payback,

01:47:37.583 --> 01:47:40.103
and I just want you
to know that, uh,

01:47:40.206 --> 01:47:42.443
I won't let you down.

01:47:42.542 --> 01:47:44.931
You have one
tactical nuclear missile

01:47:45.038 --> 01:47:46.860
we're loading
into this launcher

01:47:46.958 --> 01:47:48.202
we're installing
under the right wing.

01:47:48.302 --> 01:47:50.244
This is
the firing mechanism,

01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:52.489
to be attached to
the ship's main console.

01:47:52.591 --> 01:47:54.794
Just like the Amraam
launch pad on the Stealth.

01:47:54.894 --> 01:47:57.861
Except the nuke will not
detonate at impact.

01:47:57.966 --> 01:48:00.748
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses

01:48:00.846 --> 01:48:02.308
out of there.

01:48:02.414 --> 01:48:03.788
Good luck, gentlemen.

01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:05.857
30 seconds.

01:48:05.953 --> 01:48:06.873
Tell me. Tell me.

01:48:06.968 --> 01:48:07.868
It was the strongest
radio transmitter

01:48:07.964 --> 01:48:08.852
we could get.
It'll tell us

01:48:08.948 --> 01:48:10.341
when you've uploaded
the virus.

01:48:10.446 --> 01:48:12.268
30 seconds. Don't you
think that's cutting it

01:48:12.366 --> 01:48:13.381
a little too close?

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:16.268
Oh, we're gonna be well
on our way back home

01:48:16.366 --> 01:48:18.471
before we shoot
that thing off.

01:48:18.574 --> 01:48:19.520
Why you?

01:48:19.616 --> 01:48:20.685
David!

01:48:21.198 --> 01:48:22.278
I don't... Excuse me.

01:48:22.382 --> 01:48:23.724
I don't understand

01:48:23.822 --> 01:48:24.934
why you can't
show someone else

01:48:25.038 --> 01:48:27.307
how to plant the virus,
someone who is trained...

01:48:27.407 --> 01:48:29.349
No, no.
Something may go wrong.

01:48:29.454 --> 01:48:30.731
I may have
to think quickly,

01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:31.910
adjust the signal.

01:48:32.014 --> 01:48:33.290
Who knows?

01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:35.692
Hey, you know how,
like, I'm always trying

01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:37.678
to save the planet?

01:48:40.239 --> 01:48:41.253
Here's my chance.

01:48:44.398 --> 01:48:46.438
Now he gets ambitious.

01:48:46.542 --> 01:48:47.381
It's too tight.

01:48:47.477 --> 01:48:48.150
It's too tight.

01:48:48.246 --> 01:48:49.956
Well,
I had to borrow it.

01:48:50.062 --> 01:48:52.615
Let me see. OK. I guess
that's good enough.

01:48:52.719 --> 01:48:55.468
So, how do I look?

01:48:55.566 --> 01:48:57.671
Oh, thank you.
You're a lot of help.

01:49:00.782 --> 01:49:01.895
You're late.

01:49:01.998 --> 01:49:03.340
Well, you know me.

01:49:03.438 --> 01:49:05.292
I know. You like
to make a big entrance.

01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:06.732
Let me help you.

01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:07.844
Um, listen...

01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:09.259
before we do this,

01:49:09.358 --> 01:49:10.951
I just want to say
I'm sorry.

01:49:11.054 --> 01:49:12.942
Sorry for what,
babe?

01:49:13.038 --> 01:49:15.274
I should have done this
a long time ago.

01:49:15.374 --> 01:49:17.349
Do you have the ring?

01:49:17.454 --> 01:49:18.632
Uh, yes, sir.

01:49:18.734 --> 01:49:21.517
Here. Make yourself useful.

01:49:21.614 --> 01:49:22.573
Ow.

01:49:24.974 --> 01:49:25.920
Witnesses?

01:49:26.016 --> 01:49:27.843
- Uh...
- Um...

01:49:27.950 --> 01:49:29.510
Sorry.
We got hung up.

01:49:29.614 --> 01:49:32.461
Well, let's get this show
on the road.

01:49:32.558 --> 01:49:33.508
Dearly beloved,

01:49:33.604 --> 01:49:35.939
we're gathered here
in the sight of God

01:49:36.046 --> 01:49:38.566
and in the presence
of these witnesses

01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:40.939
to join this man
and this woman

01:49:41.038 --> 01:49:42.183
in holy matrimony.

01:49:42.286 --> 01:49:44.229
Any person who can show
good cause

01:49:44.334 --> 01:49:46.243
why these two
should not wed,

01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:49.863
please speak now, or forever
hold your peace.

01:49:52.206 --> 01:49:56.003
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife,

01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:57.452
to live together with her

01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:58.662
in the holy state
of matrimony?

01:49:58.766 --> 01:50:01.930
Will you love her,
comfort her,

01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:04.103
honor and keep her
in sickness and in health?

01:50:04.206 --> 01:50:07.435
And, forsaking all others,
keep yourself only for her

01:50:07.534 --> 01:50:10.251
as long as you
both shall live?

01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:11.528
I will.

01:50:13.614 --> 01:50:14.574
Whew.

01:50:23.886 --> 01:50:25.380
Good morning.

01:50:29.006 --> 01:50:31.308
They're a little young.

01:50:31.406 --> 01:50:32.780
That they are.

01:50:34.702 --> 01:50:36.393
They look
a little nervous.

01:50:36.494 --> 01:50:38.349
I'm gonna need
all flight crews

01:50:38.446 --> 01:50:40.682
to report to their
designated areas immediately.

01:50:41.742 --> 01:50:43.564
Major, can I borrow that?

01:50:43.662 --> 01:50:44.621
Sir.

01:50:45.966 --> 01:50:46.925
Good morning.

01:50:49.518 --> 01:50:50.565
Good morning.

01:50:52.590 --> 01:50:54.957
In less than an hour,
aircraft from here

01:50:55.054 --> 01:50:59.810
will join others
from around the world,

01:50:59.918 --> 01:51:03.180
and you will be launching
the largest aerial battle

01:51:03.278 --> 01:51:05.383
in the history of mankind.

01:51:07.118 --> 01:51:09.901
Mankind. That word
should have new meaning

01:51:09.998 --> 01:51:13.227
for all of us today.

01:51:13.326 --> 01:51:14.668
We can't be consumed

01:51:14.766 --> 01:51:18.148
by our petty differences
anymore.

01:51:18.254 --> 01:51:21.036
We will be united
in our common interests.

01:51:21.134 --> 01:51:26.763
Perhaps it's fate that today
is the 4th ofJuly,

01:51:26.862 --> 01:51:31.139
and you will once again be
fighting for our freedom...

01:51:31.246 --> 01:51:34.246
not from tyranny, oppression,
or persecution...

01:51:36.686 --> 01:51:38.246
but from annihilation.

01:51:39.694 --> 01:51:42.083
We are fighting
for our right to live.

01:51:43.726 --> 01:51:45.068
To exist.

01:51:45.166 --> 01:51:48.909
And should we win the day...

01:51:49.006 --> 01:51:52.268
the Fourth ofJuly
will no longer be known

01:51:52.366 --> 01:51:54.341
as an American holiday...

01:51:54.446 --> 01:51:57.348
but as the day when the world
declared in one voice,

01:51:57.454 --> 01:52:00.683
we will not go quietly
into the night!

01:52:00.781 --> 01:52:04.229
We will not vanish
without a fight!

01:52:04.334 --> 01:52:06.276
We're going to live on!

01:52:06.382 --> 01:52:09.230
We're going to survive!

01:52:09.326 --> 01:52:13.449
Today we celebrate
our independence day!

01:52:37.230 --> 01:52:38.176
Let's go!

01:52:38.272 --> 01:52:40.012
Mr. President,
right this way, sir.

01:52:40.110 --> 01:52:41.932
We got your gear over here.

01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:43.371
I got a jumpsuit for you,

01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:44.877
and the rest of your gear's
squared away in this duffel.

01:52:44.974 --> 01:52:46.697
You got your choice
of helmets.

01:52:49.294 --> 01:52:51.116
Mr. President,
I'd sure like to know

01:52:51.214 --> 01:52:52.326
what you're doing.

01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:54.535
I'm a combat pilot,
Will.

01:52:56.590 --> 01:52:58.630
I belong in the air.

01:53:04.942 --> 01:53:07.244
OK, sir.
Let's get you airborne.

01:53:07.342 --> 01:53:09.513
Right over here.

01:53:09.614 --> 01:53:12.134
You know,
as soon as I get back,

01:53:12.238 --> 01:53:14.605
we're gonna light
those fireworks, right?

01:53:20.590 --> 01:53:21.572
Here.

01:53:22.798 --> 01:53:23.757
Take these.

01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:28.419
Just in case.

01:53:28.526 --> 01:53:30.020
Where's... Where's, um...

01:53:40.654 --> 01:53:42.410
Just in case.

01:53:44.942 --> 01:53:46.502
I'm very proud of you.

01:53:57.805 --> 01:53:59.944
So be careful, OK?

01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:07.492
It's time.

01:54:13.006 --> 01:54:14.086
I love you.

01:54:14.190 --> 01:54:15.815
I love you.

01:54:20.910 --> 01:54:21.990
Oh, damn!

01:54:22.094 --> 01:54:23.556
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait.

01:54:23.662 --> 01:54:24.775
We got to find
some cigars.

01:54:24.878 --> 01:54:26.252
Here! Here!

01:54:26.349 --> 01:54:27.296
Take these.

01:54:27.392 --> 01:54:29.098
My last two.

01:54:29.198 --> 01:54:31.369
You are a lifesaver.

01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:34.601
Almost put a hex
on the whole damn thing.

01:54:59.694 --> 01:55:01.188
Missile launched.

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:02.788
Oh, crap!

01:55:02.894 --> 01:55:04.836
What... What did I hit?

01:55:07.277 --> 01:55:09.514
I picked a hell of a day
to quit drinking.

01:55:24.366 --> 01:55:26.886
This is
our victory dance.

01:55:26.989 --> 01:55:28.899
Not until
the fat lady sings.

01:55:29.005 --> 01:55:31.307
Oh! Yes. OK.

01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:33.036
This is important.

01:55:33.134 --> 01:55:34.563
Mm. Fat lady.

01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:35.717
I gotcha.

01:55:36.781 --> 01:55:39.148
Open launch tunnel.

01:55:56.558 --> 01:55:57.987
Shaky, huh?

01:55:58.094 --> 01:55:59.029
Is it gonna do this
the whole way?

01:55:59.125 --> 01:56:00.021
Is it gonna do this
the whole way?

01:56:00.117 --> 01:56:01.387
Just make sure

01:56:01.486 --> 01:56:02.501
your seat backs
and tray tables

01:56:02.605 --> 01:56:03.587
are in their upright
and locked position.

01:56:03.694 --> 01:56:04.970
Yeah... Is it?

01:56:08.654 --> 01:56:09.734
Let's rock 'n' roll.

01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:13.229
Oh!

01:56:13.421 --> 01:56:14.380
Aah!

01:56:16.334 --> 01:56:17.293
Oops.

01:56:17.582 --> 01:56:18.662
Oops? What does that mean?

01:56:18.766 --> 01:56:19.748
What do you mean...

01:56:19.854 --> 01:56:20.868
Nah. I... I got it.

01:56:20.974 --> 01:56:22.086
Some jerk didn't
put the...

01:56:22.190 --> 01:56:23.946
I know what I mean
when I say it.

01:56:24.046 --> 01:56:25.507
What do you mean
saying "oops" there?

01:56:25.614 --> 01:56:28.003
What do you say we try
that one again, huh?

01:56:28.110 --> 01:56:29.057
Yes, yes.

01:56:29.152 --> 01:56:30.663
Yes,
without the "oops."

01:56:30.766 --> 01:56:33.187
There's the... thataway.

01:56:33.294 --> 01:56:34.240
- Oof!
- Ooh...

01:56:34.336 --> 01:56:39.207
- Whaa... Hoo!
- Aah... Oh!

01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:41.317
I have got to get me
one of these!

01:56:50.094 --> 01:56:52.233
No... No. What was that?
Don't do that.

01:56:52.333 --> 01:56:53.511
Just trying to get
a feel for the old girl,

01:56:53.614 --> 01:56:54.560
that's all.

01:56:54.656 --> 01:56:56.167
Oh, no... no, don't.
Leave her alone.

01:56:56.269 --> 01:56:57.676
Look! No hands.

01:56:57.774 --> 01:56:58.721
Steve!

01:56:58.817 --> 01:56:59.847
Ha ha ha ha!

01:57:02.446 --> 01:57:03.787
You're all secured, sir.

01:57:03.886 --> 01:57:05.413
Grey, do you read me?

01:57:05.517 --> 01:57:06.859
Roger, Eagle One.

01:57:06.958 --> 01:57:08.780
Your primary target
has shifted course.

01:57:08.878 --> 01:57:10.056
Which way are they headed?

01:57:10.157 --> 01:57:13.506
I think our secret's out.
They're headed straight for us.

01:57:13.614 --> 01:57:15.980
ETA 26 minutes.

01:57:19.022 --> 01:57:20.844
Still with me
over there?

01:57:20.942 --> 01:57:23.080
What the hell
was I thinking?

01:57:33.294 --> 01:57:36.229
I've been waiting
for this my whole life.

01:57:47.405 --> 01:57:48.420
Head straight for it.

01:57:54.158 --> 01:57:55.500
What the hell...

01:57:55.597 --> 01:57:57.288
Don't touch them!
No, no, don't!

01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:59.146
I was counting on this.

01:57:59.246 --> 01:58:01.068
They are bringing us in.

01:58:01.166 --> 01:58:04.548
When the hell was you
gonna tell me?

01:58:04.654 --> 01:58:05.613
Oops.

01:58:05.774 --> 01:58:08.457
We're going
to have to work

01:58:08.558 --> 01:58:09.900
on our communication.

01:58:23.789 --> 01:58:25.131
We have visual.

01:58:25.230 --> 01:58:27.783
Do not engage
until we've confirmed

01:58:27.885 --> 01:58:29.708
the package
has been delivered.

01:58:29.805 --> 01:58:30.765
Roger.

01:58:36.046 --> 01:58:37.388
Major, what happens

01:58:37.485 --> 01:58:39.078
if... if that thing
gets here...

01:58:39.181 --> 01:58:41.003
before the virus
is planted?

01:58:41.101 --> 01:58:42.148
Well, ma'am,

01:58:42.254 --> 01:58:43.912
this facility's buried
deep within the mountain.

01:58:44.014 --> 01:58:45.639
It should provide us
some protection.

01:58:45.742 --> 01:58:48.742
Great. What about
the people outside?

01:58:56.206 --> 01:58:58.246
Lieutenant Sayle,
we got incoming.

01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:56.586
Oh, my God.

02:00:28.558 --> 02:00:29.802
Look at that.

02:00:39.534 --> 02:00:41.127
There must be
thousands of them,

02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:42.188
millions of them.

02:00:42.285 --> 02:00:43.976
What the hell
are they doing?

02:00:44.078 --> 02:00:46.729
Looks like they're
preparing an invasion.

02:01:13.261 --> 02:01:14.603
Hey, I don't like this.

02:01:14.701 --> 02:01:16.075
This is stupid.
They can see us!

02:01:16.173 --> 02:01:17.123
Oh, no, no, no.

02:01:17.219 --> 02:01:18.180
This thing comes
fully loaded.

02:01:18.286 --> 02:01:21.068
AM-FM radio, reclining
bucket seats, and...

02:01:21.166 --> 02:01:22.988
power windows.

02:01:36.493 --> 02:01:38.151
Come on, baby.

02:01:38.253 --> 02:01:39.595
Come on, baby.

02:01:41.613 --> 02:01:42.824
We're in.

02:01:42.925 --> 02:01:43.884
Oh.

02:01:48.494 --> 02:01:50.763
Oh, do it. Do it.

02:01:50.862 --> 02:01:52.012
Do it.

02:01:52.238 --> 02:01:53.086
Sir, he's uploading
the virus.

02:01:53.181 --> 02:01:54.088
Sir, he's uploading
the virus.

02:01:54.189 --> 02:01:56.645
Eagle One, the package
is being delivered.

02:01:56.749 --> 02:01:58.691
Stand by to engage.

02:02:00.110 --> 02:02:02.662
Roger. Eagle One.
Check left.

02:02:06.221 --> 02:02:07.168
Hey, listen up.

02:02:07.264 --> 02:02:08.458
We have
an emergency situation.

02:02:08.558 --> 02:02:10.696
We need everyone to grab
everything they can.

02:02:10.797 --> 02:02:12.139
Only what you can carry.

02:02:12.238 --> 02:02:14.310
We need to get you inside
immediately.

02:02:17.837 --> 02:02:18.819
The virus is in.

02:02:24.845 --> 02:02:27.365
All we can do now
is... pray.

02:02:28.621 --> 02:02:29.831
Delivery complete.
Engage.

02:02:29.934 --> 02:02:32.072
Delivery complete.
It's a go. It's a go.

02:02:32.173 --> 02:02:34.312
Eagle One. Fox Three.

02:02:38.414 --> 02:02:39.843
Gentlemen, this is it.

02:02:42.349 --> 02:02:44.805
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

02:02:51.502 --> 02:02:52.461
God.

02:02:57.421 --> 02:02:59.243
Virus ineffective.
Disengage.

02:02:59.341 --> 02:03:01.196
Get your people
out of there.

02:03:01.293 --> 02:03:04.195
Disengage.
Rear flank, follow suit.

02:03:04.301 --> 02:03:05.643
Hold on,
Command.

02:03:07.149 --> 02:03:08.938
I want another
shot at it.

02:03:09.038 --> 02:03:10.379
Sir, I strongly recommend
you disengage.

02:03:10.477 --> 02:03:12.395
Eagle One.

02:03:13.005 --> 02:03:13.964
Fox Three.

02:03:26.733 --> 02:03:28.358
Direct hit!

02:03:28.461 --> 02:03:30.217
Squadron leaders,
fire at will! Fire at will!

02:03:30.317 --> 02:03:31.844
Fire at will!

02:03:31.949 --> 02:03:34.731
We're going in.
Squadron leaders, take point.

02:03:36.174 --> 02:03:37.124
Eagle Six at seven.

02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:38.144
Eagle Five at three.

02:03:38.239 --> 02:03:39.127
Eagle One...

02:03:39.222 --> 02:03:40.090
Fox Two!

02:03:40.186 --> 02:03:41.322
Eagle 20. Fox Two!

02:03:50.029 --> 02:03:50.976
Evasive maneuvers!

02:03:51.071 --> 02:03:53.706
Squadron leaders,
evasive maneuvers!

02:03:53.806 --> 02:03:54.983
Prepare to engage!

02:04:00.045 --> 02:04:03.209
All right,
Mr. President, here we go!

02:04:03.309 --> 02:04:05.065
All right, baby,
I've got you.

02:04:07.246 --> 02:04:08.675
Payback's a bitch,
ain't it?

02:04:11.309 --> 02:04:13.414
OK, job's done.
Let's go home.

02:04:13.517 --> 02:04:14.859
Gladly.

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:20.064
What's up?

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:21.736
We're stuck.

02:04:21.837 --> 02:04:22.784
What?

02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:23.943
It's not responding.
It's stuck.

02:04:24.045 --> 02:04:25.158
Then try again.

02:04:39.534 --> 02:04:41.192
Come on! Come on!

02:05:12.685 --> 02:05:14.179
Steve! Steve!

02:05:19.757 --> 02:05:21.317
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

02:05:21.421 --> 02:05:22.376
It's not me.

02:05:22.472 --> 02:05:23.557
They're overriding
the system.

02:05:23.661 --> 02:05:24.611
Oh... shit!

02:05:24.707 --> 02:05:25.639
Um...

02:05:25.734 --> 02:05:26.674
hide.

02:05:32.621 --> 02:05:33.963
Everybody hold
someone's hand.

02:05:34.061 --> 02:05:35.020
Hold hands!

02:05:36.045 --> 02:05:37.004
Come on in.

02:05:40.525 --> 02:05:41.866
I'm not Jewish.

02:05:41.965 --> 02:05:42.980
Nobody's perfect.

02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:48.079
God!

02:05:48.624 --> 02:05:49.638
Where are they?

02:05:58.032 --> 02:06:00.137
This could be our
last night on Earth.

02:06:03.312 --> 02:06:05.320
I... I don't want
to die a virgin.

02:06:10.897 --> 02:06:12.620
If we do...

02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:14.313
we'll both die virgins.

02:06:14.416 --> 02:06:16.042
But at least
we'll be together.

02:06:24.144 --> 02:06:26.302
Are you scared?

02:06:26.398 --> 02:06:27.357
Me, too.

02:06:30.112 --> 02:06:31.290
Eagle Seven. Fox Two.

02:06:31.391 --> 02:06:32.853
Eagle Three. Fox Two.

02:06:39.648 --> 02:06:41.174
We're running
out of missiles, sir.

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:43.003
We're just not
causing enough damage.

02:06:43.104 --> 02:06:44.598
It's settling
directly over us.

02:06:53.727 --> 02:06:56.029
They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon!

02:06:56.128 --> 02:06:59.706
Then let's take it out
before it takes us out.

02:07:03.839 --> 02:07:05.530
Target at 12 o'clock.

02:07:07.679 --> 02:07:08.988
My God,
they're everywhere.

02:07:10.239 --> 02:07:12.028
Bandits on our tail!
They're locked on!

02:07:12.127 --> 02:07:13.086
I see 'em!

02:07:16.288 --> 02:07:18.426
All right, squadron leaders,
I want weapons check.

02:07:19.872 --> 02:07:21.148
You're outta time!

02:07:21.248 --> 02:07:22.328
You've gotta disable
it now!

02:07:25.792 --> 02:07:28.661
I'm in range.
Locking on.

02:07:28.768 --> 02:07:31.135
I've got tone.
Eagle One. Fox Two!

02:07:40.607 --> 02:07:42.134
That is a negative impact.

02:07:42.239 --> 02:07:44.247
That is an N.I.
Negative impact.

02:07:44.351 --> 02:07:47.199
I'm out of missiles.
Eagle Two!

02:07:47.295 --> 02:07:48.254
I'm on it.

02:07:50.463 --> 02:07:52.568
Oh! Oh! Jesus!

02:07:54.944 --> 02:07:56.253
Sir, all missiles
have been fired.

02:07:56.352 --> 02:07:57.298
You're out of time!

02:07:57.394 --> 02:07:58.424
Get your ass
out of there!

02:07:58.528 --> 02:07:59.640
We're not done yet!

02:07:59.744 --> 02:08:00.921
Get as far away
as you can!

02:08:01.023 --> 02:08:02.911
Doesn't anyone have
any missiles left?

02:08:03.007 --> 02:08:04.982
Sorry I'm late,
Mr. President!

02:08:08.576 --> 02:08:09.950
Kinda got hung up
back there.

02:08:10.048 --> 02:08:11.771
Pilot, you armed?

02:08:11.872 --> 02:08:13.213
Armed and ready, sir.

02:08:13.311 --> 02:08:14.686
I'm packin'.

02:08:16.064 --> 02:08:17.010
Who is that guy?

02:08:17.106 --> 02:08:18.715
Put him
on speaker.

02:08:18.815 --> 02:08:19.762
Pilot,
identify yourself.

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:22.164
It's me. Russell Casse, sir.

02:08:22.272 --> 02:08:24.890
I told you I wouldn't
let you down.

02:08:24.991 --> 02:08:26.814
Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds,

02:08:26.911 --> 02:08:28.057
will ya?

02:08:28.159 --> 02:08:30.396
OK.
Echo-9er, Echo-7.

02:08:30.495 --> 02:08:31.442
Take flanking positions.

02:08:31.538 --> 02:08:32.950
I want you to look
after this guy.

02:08:33.055 --> 02:08:36.371
All right, boys, let's
give Mr. Casse some cover.

02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:40.189
Gentlemen...
let's plow the road!

02:08:47.232 --> 02:08:49.119
We'll draw 'em off,
and it'll be all yours!

02:08:49.216 --> 02:08:52.118
Whoa-hoo!
Look out! Comin' through!

02:08:53.791 --> 02:08:55.035
I've got tone.

02:08:57.215 --> 02:08:59.517
Eagle 20. Fox Two.

02:09:06.848 --> 02:09:08.124
Eagle 20. Fox Two.

02:09:11.775 --> 02:09:12.757
It's jammed!

02:09:12.864 --> 02:09:15.352
It won't fire.

02:09:18.495 --> 02:09:19.772
Damn it!

02:09:30.144 --> 02:09:31.551
Do me a favor.

02:09:33.887 --> 02:09:35.894
Tell my children...

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.455
I love them very much.

02:09:40.544 --> 02:09:42.748
All right,
you alien assholes!

02:09:42.847 --> 02:09:46.262
In the words of
my generation...

02:09:46.367 --> 02:09:48.093
up yours!

02:09:50.271 --> 02:09:51.897
Dad!
What's he doing?

02:09:51.999 --> 02:09:53.341
Come on, baby!

02:09:53.439 --> 02:09:55.032
Come on, baby! Come on!

02:09:58.463 --> 02:09:59.707
Good luck, buddy.

02:10:07.999 --> 02:10:10.104
Hello, boys!

02:10:10.208 --> 02:10:11.934
I'm back!

02:10:32.095 --> 02:10:33.502
He did it!

02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:35.869
The son of a bitch did it!

02:10:38.783 --> 02:10:39.798
All right!

02:11:01.759 --> 02:11:05.207
What your father did
was very brave.

02:11:05.311 --> 02:11:07.067
You should be
proud of him.

02:11:07.167 --> 02:11:08.126
I am.

02:11:26.335 --> 02:11:28.757
Now we know how
to take them out, General.

02:11:28.863 --> 02:11:30.238
Spread the word.

02:11:32.895 --> 02:11:34.237
Get on the wire

02:11:34.336 --> 02:11:36.408
to every squadron
around the world.

02:11:36.511 --> 02:11:40.220
Tell 'em how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

02:11:52.799 --> 02:11:54.228
What do you think?

02:11:56.191 --> 02:11:57.533
Checkmate.

02:12:21.376 --> 02:12:22.717
Wow, it's funny.

02:12:22.815 --> 02:12:24.157
I always thought
that things like these

02:12:24.256 --> 02:12:25.303
would kill me.

02:12:29.056 --> 02:12:30.015
Thank you.

02:12:38.879 --> 02:12:40.734
It's been a pleasure.

02:12:40.831 --> 02:12:42.424
Steve, you, too.

02:12:46.623 --> 02:12:48.399
There's only one thing
left to do.

02:12:48.495 --> 02:12:49.454
There's only one thing
left to do.

02:12:53.823 --> 02:12:54.974
Ready?

02:12:55.551 --> 02:12:56.958
Yes, sir.

02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:04.306
Hey! All right!

02:13:04.402 --> 02:13:05.367
Hey, hey!

02:13:05.471 --> 02:13:06.519
Look at us!

02:13:06.623 --> 02:13:07.965
Take a look
at the Earthlings.

02:13:08.064 --> 02:13:09.790
Good-bye!

02:13:09.984 --> 02:13:10.966
Y'all take care,
all right?

02:13:11.071 --> 02:13:12.893
Nothin' but love
for ya.

02:13:12.991 --> 02:13:15.064
Do you think
they have any clue

02:13:15.167 --> 02:13:16.989
what's about
to happen to 'em?

02:13:17.087 --> 02:13:18.265
Oh, not a chance
in hell.

02:13:18.368 --> 02:13:19.327
Good night.

02:13:26.207 --> 02:13:27.166
Peace!

02:13:33.887 --> 02:13:34.846
Ohh!

02:13:40.255 --> 02:13:41.201
We're loose.

02:13:41.297 --> 02:13:42.208
Can you get us
out of here

02:13:42.304 --> 02:13:43.180
in 30 seconds?

02:13:43.276 --> 02:13:44.247
I ain't heard
no fat lady!

02:13:44.351 --> 02:13:45.297
Forget the fat lady.

02:13:45.393 --> 02:13:46.304
You're obsessed with
the fat lady.

02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:47.324
Drive us outta here.

02:13:54.144 --> 02:13:55.867
Ohh! They're
chasing us.

02:13:55.967 --> 02:13:56.926
Oh, really? You think?

02:14:05.056 --> 02:14:06.135
Oh, that was a hit.
I took a hit.

02:14:06.239 --> 02:14:07.319
We're not hit!
We're not hit!

02:14:07.423 --> 02:14:08.568
Stop side-seat driving.

02:14:12.384 --> 02:14:13.330
Left, left.
Tunnel, tunnel.

02:14:13.426 --> 02:14:14.587
Exit, exit. Left!

02:14:14.687 --> 02:14:15.832
Where the hell
do you think I'm going?

02:14:15.935 --> 02:14:17.309
Ok, we-we-we're, uh...

02:14:34.431 --> 02:14:35.478
Uh-oh, they're
closing up on us.

02:14:35.583 --> 02:14:36.859
Is that closing?

02:14:36.959 --> 02:14:38.039
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

02:14:38.143 --> 02:14:40.248
Must go faster.
Must go faster.

02:14:40.351 --> 02:14:42.009
- Go, go, go, go!
- Aaaaahh!

02:14:42.111 --> 02:14:43.645
Aaaaahh!

02:14:52.191 --> 02:14:53.150
Aah!

02:14:53.535 --> 02:14:55.607
Elvis has left
the building!

02:14:57.151 --> 02:14:59.671
Ohh!
I love you, man.

02:16:26.399 --> 02:16:28.538
They're going down
all over the world, Tom.

02:16:28.639 --> 02:16:29.817
We got 'em beat.

02:16:29.919 --> 02:16:32.121
How about our two
delivery boys?

02:16:32.223 --> 02:16:33.401
Any word from them?

02:16:36.094 --> 02:16:37.404
We lost contact

02:16:37.503 --> 02:16:40.186
with Captain Hiller
and Levinson

02:16:40.287 --> 02:16:41.628
nearly 20 minutes
ago.

02:16:44.767 --> 02:16:45.722
Hold it!

02:16:45.816 --> 02:16:46.753
Hold on, sir.

02:16:46.848 --> 02:16:48.343
I've got something
on radar.

02:17:34.207 --> 02:17:35.865
Sorry, sir.

02:17:35.967 --> 02:17:36.913
Good job.

02:17:37.009 --> 02:17:38.007
Thank you.

02:17:38.111 --> 02:17:39.058
Well done, Captain.

02:17:39.154 --> 02:17:40.249
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:48.830
David...

02:17:51.359 --> 02:17:52.537
not bad.

02:17:55.519 --> 02:17:57.341
Thank you,
Mr. President.

02:17:58.590 --> 02:18:01.012
Not too bad at all.

02:18:02.271 --> 02:18:04.093
Oh, so this is healthy?

02:18:04.191 --> 02:18:06.493
Oh, I could
get used to it.

02:18:23.967 --> 02:18:26.170
Happy 4th ofJuly,
Daddy.

02:18:26.271 --> 02:18:28.245
Same to you,
munchkin.

02:18:29.630 --> 02:18:32.281
Didn't I promise you
fireworks?

02:18:32.383 --> 02:18:33.342
Yeah.
