00:16.830 --> 00:18.595
I hate being the new girl.

00:18.815 --> 00:20.106
You'll be fine.

00:22.059 --> 00:23.749
What if nobody likes me?

00:23.930 --> 00:25.856
Why wouldn't they like you?

00:26.496 --> 00:28.294
- I don't know.
- Just...

00:28.972 --> 00:30.036
be yourself.

00:33.262 --> 00:34.269
Myself.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.488
You know, Nicole's kids go here.

00:36.669 --> 00:37.979
Kyle's your age.

00:38.447 --> 00:39.842
I don't know Kyle.

00:39.994 --> 00:41.752
I bet you two have a lot in common.

00:41.872 --> 00:43.360
- How would you know?
- I don't,

00:43.490 --> 00:45.408
but you won't make friends
if you don't try.

00:49.509 --> 00:50.516
Okay.

00:57.843 --> 00:58.964
Have a nice day.

01:02.933 --> 01:04.319
Well, that's subtle.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.864
Nice rims.

01:06.704 --> 01:10.088
Josh, the car is not on display
for you to admire its accessories.

01:10.208 --> 01:11.279
Somebody died in it.

01:11.437 --> 01:14.687
Somebody who shouldn't have guzzled
a bucket of vodka before driving.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.959
- Check out that stereo.
- You're diseased.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.683
Kyle, knock some sense into him.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.153
I'm sorry I haven't fixed your radio.

01:25.290 --> 01:27.846
You have been remiss
in your boy genius duties.

01:28.670 --> 01:30.221
I've had a lot on my mind.

01:30.784 --> 01:31.981
I think I'm in a gunk.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.040
- A what?
- A guy funk.

01:35.070 --> 01:36.356
It's your word.

01:36.870 --> 01:39.624
<i>Oh, yeah. No,"gunk" is over.
You have the ennui.</i>

01:40.536 --> 01:42.514
<i>Ennui? Isn't that French?</i>

01:42.671 --> 01:44.749
<i>Ennui is the new gunk. Trust me.</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:15.672
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 7:
Free To Be You And Me</font>

02:19.320 --> 02:21.194
<i>I was surrounded by people,</i>

02:21.530 --> 02:23.163
<i>many of them friends,</i>

02:23.883 --> 02:26.009
<i>but none who knew the real me.</i>

02:29.700 --> 02:32.562
<i>Foss had made it clear that
he was the only one I should trust,</i>

02:32.714 --> 02:35.857
<i>and I had allowed him to set the rules
for how I lived my life.</i>

02:36.249 --> 02:39.021
<i>But now all I felt was doubt and regret.</i>

02:44.184 --> 02:45.191
These are for you.

02:47.460 --> 02:48.681
- Why?
- Well, let's see.

02:48.811 --> 02:51.634
A piano mysteriously appeared
in my living room last night.

02:52.002 --> 02:53.401
- Really?
- When I asked Mom

02:53.521 --> 02:55.977
how it got there,
she rolled her eyes in annoyance.

02:56.230 --> 02:57.713
- She did?
- The only person

02:57.868 --> 03:00.093
who could annoy her like that is you.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.049
- True.
- Ergo, flowers.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.433
Actually, tap-rooted
perennial herbaceous plant.

03:09.372 --> 03:11.013
I love them. Thank you.

03:11.133 --> 03:13.212
Are you kidding? Thank you.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.577
You've been such a good friend
to me through everything.

03:16.950 --> 03:18.564
You've been a good friend to me, too.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.911
And I was thinking maybe
that I should return the favor.

03:23.052 --> 03:24.457
You want to give me a piano?

03:24.753 --> 03:25.760
No.

03:26.260 --> 03:29.448
But I thought we could go
to the Spring Fling dance together.

03:29.650 --> 03:31.226
I mean, if you wanted to.

03:32.958 --> 03:34.268
Your mom won't like that.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.458
My mom left this morning for a week.
The cat's away.

03:38.255 --> 03:39.280
You don't have a cat.

03:40.685 --> 03:42.887
No. I mean I can do whatever I want.

03:43.159 --> 03:45.432
She's not around to control my life,

03:45.552 --> 03:47.673
to tell me who to hang out with.

03:49.180 --> 03:50.364
My cat's away, too.

03:51.459 --> 03:53.623
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

03:54.370 --> 03:56.382
Great. That's great.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.061
Okay, well, I'll... I'll see you later.

04:02.937 --> 04:03.943
See you later.

04:08.310 --> 04:11.200
<i>A single bright moment
in an otherwise dark time.</i>

04:11.388 --> 04:13.777
<i>With Foss not around to dictate my days,</i>

04:13.897 --> 04:17.036
<i>I could finally pursue the very thing
he'd wanted me to give up:</i>

04:17.168 --> 04:18.608
<i>a life.</i>

04:20.817 --> 04:22.829
- Thank you.
- There you go, sir. You're welcome.

04:22.988 --> 04:25.152
- Yes, Madam?
- Hi. Uh, can I get

04:25.329 --> 04:27.243
a large latte double shot?

04:27.657 --> 04:29.119
Start the day off with a jolt, huh?

04:29.364 --> 04:30.693
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

04:30.893 --> 04:33.571
Yeah. I just dropped my sister off

04:33.704 --> 04:35.546
for her first day at a new school.

04:36.248 --> 04:37.685
She's nervou, I'm nervous.

04:37.805 --> 04:39.535
I figured I'd drown myself in caffeine.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.600
- What school?
- Beachwood.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.328
Oh, my kids go there.

04:43.496 --> 04:45.140
- Yeah?
- What's her name?

04:45.270 --> 04:46.602
Jessi Hollander.

04:46.722 --> 04:48.682
And I'm Emily, in case you forgot.

04:48.802 --> 04:50.410
It's Stephen, right?

04:50.560 --> 04:51.890
Stephen Trager.

04:52.331 --> 04:53.337
Trager.

04:53.716 --> 04:55.444
Any relation to Nicole?

04:56.530 --> 04:57.770
She's my wife.

04:57.927 --> 04:58.934
No.

05:00.506 --> 05:01.702
Unbelievable.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.391
Jessi's been taking
some private therapy sessions with her.

05:04.562 --> 05:05.799
- You're kidding.
- No.

05:05.935 --> 05:07.476
She has been so great with her.

05:08.690 --> 05:12.000
So, how are you enjoying
life at Madacorp?

05:12.120 --> 05:13.527
Oh, well, so far, so good,

05:13.647 --> 05:16.674
although I don't understand
half of what they do here.

05:17.248 --> 05:19.811
We're building the foundations
for tomorrow.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.359
- Right.
- Yes, we're very important.

05:22.582 --> 05:25.887
- I tell my kids to watch your sister.
- Oh, that would be great.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.689
She's had a rough time,
but she's a really good kid.

05:29.215 --> 05:30.544
Well, maybe they can be friends.

05:31.688 --> 05:32.694
I hope so.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.370
- Wel, I got to go.
- Okay.

05:36.490 --> 05:38.715
- I'll see you around.
- Bye.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.026
You're off the hook.

05:46.519 --> 05:48.702
I didn't know I was on a hook.

05:48.835 --> 05:50.550
I know you have a secret burning desire

05:50.710 --> 05:52.330
to ask me to the dance,

05:52.460 --> 05:53.462
but I can't go.

05:53.591 --> 05:56.873
And why, perchance,
has this hideous fate befallen me?

05:57.264 --> 06:00.429
I got nabbed for trying to borrow
the stereo from the drunk-driving car.

06:00.685 --> 06:03.191
You tried to steal
a dead person's radio?

06:03.545 --> 06:04.552
Borrow.

06:04.758 --> 06:06.201
So you can't go to the dance.

06:06.404 --> 06:07.676
I was ordered to clean-up duty.

06:07.796 --> 06:09.171
- Sucks.
- Totally.

06:09.294 --> 06:12.228
What sucks even more is that you have
to clean up after me and my dates.

06:12.750 --> 06:13.801
Your who?

06:14.389 --> 06:15.395
Dates.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.527
You have multiple dates for the dance?

06:18.540 --> 06:19.581
Uh, yeah.

06:20.445 --> 06:21.452
Is that a problem?

06:21.635 --> 06:22.722
No, I just thought...

06:22.861 --> 06:25.938
That I had a secret burning
desire to ask you?

06:26.619 --> 06:27.625
Yeah. No.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.548
How's a girl supposed to combat PMS

06:31.710 --> 06:33.627
when the chocolate machine's
on the fritz?

06:33.876 --> 06:36.583
- Did you buy the dance tickets?
- They wouldn't sell them to me.

06:36.762 --> 06:37.768
Why not?

06:38.370 --> 06:39.604
Because you're a girl.

06:40.620 --> 06:42.309
- And?
- And that's it.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.197
They won't sell same-sex couple tickets.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.130
But we're not a same-sex couple.

06:46.290 --> 06:48.238
We're just two girls
who currently hate men.

06:48.472 --> 06:49.765
I tried to explain that,

06:49.917 --> 06:51.714
then they told me
to buy two single tickets,

06:51.834 --> 06:53.308
which were more expensive.

06:53.449 --> 06:55.404
Then I got all PMS-y on them.

06:55.542 --> 06:57.172
They told me to go away.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.397
That's stupid.

06:58.556 --> 06:59.572
Whatever.

07:00.775 --> 07:01.782
Yes.

07:03.617 --> 07:04.624
Hi.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.301
Hi, mood swing.
What's got you all peppy?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.041
I'm going to the dance with Amanda.

07:09.216 --> 07:10.564
Oh, the hypocrisy.

07:10.779 --> 07:13.057
You have a date with Amanda?

07:13.575 --> 07:14.885
Oh, no. It's not a date.

07:16.410 --> 07:17.519
How do you know?

07:17.818 --> 07:19.318
She told me she's doing me a favor.

07:19.753 --> 07:21.070
A favor?

07:21.190 --> 07:23.803
Kyle, what exactly did she say?

07:24.639 --> 07:27.586
She said, "You've been such a good
friend "to me through everything,

07:27.718 --> 07:30.404
and I was thinking maybe
that I should return the favor.

07:30.524 --> 07:32.897
I thought we could go
to the Spring Fling dance together."

07:33.020 --> 07:34.550
I mea, if you wanted to."

07:34.689 --> 07:36.512
And then she said something about a cat.

07:37.173 --> 07:40.496
Oh, you sweet, clueless little muffin.

07:40.617 --> 07:42.570
You better put on your dancing shoes

07:42.724 --> 07:44.813
because you have a date.

07:48.454 --> 07:49.460
I do?

07:50.311 --> 07:51.659
You totally do.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.051
Dibs on the new girl.

08:05.660 --> 08:07.087
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.844
- You go here?
- Yes.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.968
I'm, uh, I'm Charlie Tanner.

08:13.139 --> 08:15.589
I'll happily be your one-man
welcoming committee.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.141
Maybe later we could hang out.

08:19.617 --> 08:21.003
I'd like to do more kissing.

08:25.740 --> 08:27.573
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

08:27.743 --> 08:28.750
Who's that?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.845
One of my mom's troubled teens.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.696
She looks like trouble.

08:33.275 --> 08:35.659
You say that because
she's totally smoking hot and sexy

08:35.789 --> 08:37.210
and hitting on my ex-boyfriend.

08:37.419 --> 08:38.427
Pretty much.

08:38.957 --> 08:40.837
I think I have to hate her.

08:41.116 --> 08:42.332
<i>Au contraire.</i>

08:42.899 --> 08:44.588
Keep your friends close

08:44.822 --> 08:46.815
and your enemies even closer.

08:47.142 --> 08:48.850
Make that girl your "frenemy."

09:07.516 --> 09:09.707
- What's the matter?
- I have a date with Amanda.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.167
Well, that's great.

09:12.581 --> 09:13.854
No, it's terrible.

09:14.403 --> 09:16.260
- Why?
- Because I feel sick.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.166
When did that start?

09:19.033 --> 09:20.419
When I found out it was a date.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.617
It's just anxiety.

09:23.410 --> 09:25.930
But why am I anxious? I like her.

09:26.101 --> 09:27.983
I've liked her
since the first time I saw her.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.571
That's precisely why you're scared.

09:31.010 --> 09:33.891
If you weren't,
then you'd have reason to worry.

09:37.180 --> 09:38.206
You feel better?

09:39.359 --> 09:40.385
Working on it.

09:41.095 --> 09:43.373
Take a minute. I'll get us some water.

09:46.442 --> 09:47.809
Jessi, hi.

09:48.247 --> 09:49.254
Hello.

09:49.393 --> 09:51.422
I'm sorry. I didn't hear
the back doorbell ring.

09:51.542 --> 09:52.617
Do we have a session today?

09:52.785 --> 09:55.044
Hey, Mom. I invited Jessi over.

09:55.483 --> 09:56.489
Oh.

09:56.887 --> 09:57.951
That's nice.

09:58.518 --> 09:59.923
Lore, do you have a second?

10:00.119 --> 10:02.398
Sure. Make yourself at home.

10:07.845 --> 10:09.155
Since when are you two friends?

10:09.307 --> 10:11.546
She's not my friend. She's my "frenemy."

10:12.398 --> 10:13.890
Regardless of semantics, Lori,

10:14.040 --> 10:15.826
I really don't think
this is appropriate.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.210
I need to keep an eye on her.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.070
She's all over Declan,

10:36.199 --> 10:38.382
and I just don't think
they're a good match.

10:38.793 --> 10:42.125
Well, I don't think pretending to be
her friend is the mature choice.

11:13.361 --> 11:14.956
You're crossing boundaries here.

11:15.329 --> 11:17.237
Your job is what brought
Kyle into this house.

11:17.390 --> 11:19.939
Don't you think you should be
a little flexible on the matter?

11:41.263 --> 11:42.279
Hi.

11:42.833 --> 11:43.840
Hi.

11:44.530 --> 11:45.653
You're Kyle.

11:46.266 --> 11:47.291
You're in my tub.

11:49.374 --> 11:50.685
It's comfortable.

11:50.897 --> 11:53.081
You didn't think it's strange
I sleep in a tub?

11:54.253 --> 11:55.260
Is it?

11:56.050 --> 11:57.360
Maybe a little.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.305
You must be Jessi.

12:05.140 --> 12:06.270
You're here for Nicole.

12:06.420 --> 12:07.699
You call your mom Nicole?

12:08.467 --> 12:09.910
She's my guardian.

12:10.392 --> 12:11.987
She used to be my therapis, too.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.851
Were you troubled?

12:16.246 --> 12:17.253
I'm troubled.

12:17.710 --> 12:18.717
Why?

12:20.765 --> 12:21.961
I'm not sure.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.419
Have we met before?

12:35.943 --> 12:37.367
I don't think so.

13:10.070 --> 13:11.240
Sweet. Pizza.

13:11.380 --> 13:12.877
I thought you liked when I cooked.

13:13.021 --> 13:15.794
Yeah, but ever since you got good at it,
we never get cool food.

13:16.022 --> 13:18.661
I'll try to remember that.
Where is everybody?

13:20.175 --> 13:21.182
Finally.

13:21.316 --> 13:22.854
Uh, I'll take that.

13:23.140 --> 13:25.920
Principal Hooper called.
You won't be needing this for a while.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.945
I blame you.
If you'd fixed this a week ago,

13:29.083 --> 13:30.261
I wouldn't have been tempted.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.317
I didn't fix it. Jessi did.

13:32.668 --> 13:33.674
Jessi did?

13:34.630 --> 13:36.990
Who's Jessi?
And is she hot or just smart?

13:37.164 --> 13:39.860
She's one of my patients.
She's off-limits on all fronts.

13:40.141 --> 13:43.236
Here we go again.
Mom's setting boundaries.

13:43.396 --> 13:44.592
Mom's rights.

13:45.117 --> 13:48.126
Twice in one day people are telling
me who I'm allowed to hang out with.

13:48.259 --> 13:51.275
The stupid school won't sell us
same-sex couple dance tickets.

13:51.408 --> 13:53.247
What? Well, that's ridiculous.

13:53.449 --> 13:55.006
What's wrong with same-sex couples?

13:55.279 --> 13:56.286
Nothing...

13:56.881 --> 13:58.154
if they're girls.

13:58.335 --> 13:59.350
Neanderthal.

13:59.470 --> 14:00.792
Why are girls okay and not guys?

14:00.912 --> 14:02.141
Both should be okay.

14:03.308 --> 14:04.537
Why is the school saying no?

14:04.657 --> 14:07.655
Apparently, they're still living
in the 20th Century.

14:08.499 --> 14:09.810
Sweet. Pizza.

14:10.002 --> 14:11.293
I'm never cooking again.

14:11.430 --> 14:13.139
Dad, thank God you're here.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.322
<i>Dinner was becoming an episode of Oprah.</i>

14:16.351 --> 14:19.721
Hey, guys, I have a coworker whose
sister just started at your school.

14:19.957 --> 14:21.400
It's your patient, Jessi Hollander.

14:22.005 --> 14:24.186
- Emily works at Madacorp?
- Mm-hmm.

14:24.319 --> 14:26.085
I told her you'd
keep an eye out for Jessi.

14:26.242 --> 14:27.248
Ha!

14:28.170 --> 14:30.375
Stephen, you have terrible timing.

14:38.621 --> 14:39.893
Is Lori your friend?

14:40.785 --> 14:43.750
- You want to talk about Lori?
- Well, she's being nice to me,

14:43.910 --> 14:45.986
and my sister said
that I should make friends.

14:47.036 --> 14:48.042
You are.

14:50.870 --> 14:53.189
- What about Kyle?
- What about him?

14:53.521 --> 14:54.546
Is he your friend?

14:55.149 --> 14:56.383
He used to be.

14:56.675 --> 14:58.315
I don't really have any friends.

14:58.444 --> 15:00.172
Well, they're overrated.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.266
You're lonely.

15:05.660 --> 15:06.977
I'm lonely, too.

15:15.859 --> 15:16.865
What's going on?

15:19.670 --> 15:21.048
Jessi, what are you doing?

15:21.168 --> 15:22.170
Making friends.

15:23.068 --> 15:24.397
Hi. I'm...

15:24.530 --> 15:25.536
Leaving.

15:35.710 --> 15:36.999
Who the hell was that?

15:37.231 --> 15:38.237
Declan.

15:38.685 --> 15:39.995
You are not seeing him again.

15:41.162 --> 15:42.415
But I like him.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.756
We have a lot in common,
there's a dance this...

15:44.876 --> 15:46.342
No. You are not going with him.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.425
Jessi, what is it?

15:54.316 --> 15:55.322
My head.

15:56.862 --> 15:58.552
You said I should meet people.

15:59.195 --> 16:00.866
Not him. That's not who I meant.

16:01.434 --> 16:02.592
Then who did you mean?

16:05.760 --> 16:06.767
Jessi,

16:07.356 --> 16:09.730
stop being so dramatic,
and just do what you're told.

16:16.949 --> 16:17.956
Hi.

16:18.425 --> 16:20.608
- Hi.
- I saw you from my window.

16:21.291 --> 16:23.056
What are you doing out here?

16:23.298 --> 16:24.437
Can't sleep.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.171
What are you doing?

16:27.323 --> 16:30.148
My mom said I'm supposed to be in bed
by 10 while she's out of town.

16:30.488 --> 16:32.425
- It's 11.
- Exactly.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.141
Are you okay?

16:44.600 --> 16:45.710
Not really.

16:47.996 --> 16:49.002
Kyle,

16:50.080 --> 16:53.318
it's okay if you don't want
to go with me to the dance.

16:53.479 --> 16:56.536
I didn't mean to make you
uncomfortable by asking you.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.254
I do want to go to the dance with you.

16:59.350 --> 17:01.420
Then why are you acting so weird?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.907
Nicole says it's because I like you.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.234
You do?

17:12.428 --> 17:13.491
Of course.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.416
Don't you like me?

17:18.761 --> 17:20.051
Well, yeah.

17:21.021 --> 17:22.027
Yea, I do.

17:24.619 --> 17:25.722
I like you.

17:28.690 --> 17:31.111
So we're going to the dance together.

17:32.890 --> 17:34.143
And you're okay with that?

17:36.630 --> 17:39.429
It's the best thing
that's happened to me in a long time.

17:59.530 --> 18:02.367
Hey, potentially sane Trager
and perky blonde girl.

18:02.553 --> 18:04.356
In the mood for a little
civil disobedience?

18:04.477 --> 18:05.617
Does it involve drinking?

18:05.779 --> 18:08.475
Only if rehab's your idea
of social activism.

18:08.682 --> 18:12.334
It's your chance to overcome the obvious
genetic deficiencies in your family.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.522
"Beachwood bias"?

18:13.642 --> 18:15.099
You're protesting the dance policy?

18:15.327 --> 18:16.827
Yes, the dance policy.

18:17.005 --> 18:19.966
A bunch of us are ditching first period
to plaster the school with these.

18:20.124 --> 18:21.377
We need more bodies.

18:21.704 --> 18:23.081
Yeah, we're not,

18:23.594 --> 18:26.081
you know, of the lesbionic variety.

18:26.202 --> 18:28.404
I don't really think
that's the point, Hils.

18:28.898 --> 18:30.872
You heard about us
getting denied dance tickets?

18:31.001 --> 18:32.615
She made a little bit of a scene.

18:32.818 --> 18:34.641
What? I was cranky. Sue me.

18:34.841 --> 18:37.360
Anyway, I thought you guys
might be into taking a stand,

18:37.530 --> 18:39.894
having a voice, that kind
of important life stuff.

18:40.029 --> 18:42.526
But maybe I pegged you
wrong. Whatever. No big.

18:42.671 --> 18:44.094
He, wait. Hold on.

18:44.655 --> 18:46.098
You said you need more bodies?

18:46.317 --> 18:47.362
Yeah. Why?

18:47.780 --> 18:49.878
You know anyone who wants
to help change the world?

18:51.090 --> 18:52.253
As a matter of fact, I do.

18:52.386 --> 18:54.113
I can't believe I'm skipping class.

18:54.242 --> 18:55.951
And you're skipping class.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.090
I got a hall pass.

18:58.086 --> 18:59.478
Your teacher give you a hall pass?

18:59.598 --> 19:02.591
Mr. Miller's an advocate for
the principles of nonviolent resistance.

19:02.711 --> 19:04.204
I need more flyers.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.414
Hillary and I are gonna
wrap the flagpole.

19:06.570 --> 19:08.132
She wanted to chain herself to it naked

19:08.290 --> 19:10.516
with the words "I heart gay"
written on her body, but

19:10.636 --> 19:11.976
this seemed like a better plan.

19:12.096 --> 19:13.281
You're really enjoying this.

19:13.726 --> 19:15.526
I'm embracing my inner activist.

19:15.661 --> 19:17.339
That little Andy's a spitfire.

19:17.510 --> 19:19.352
She definitely knows
how to rile people up.

19:19.557 --> 19:22.405
I know. Poor Josh.
She'll eat him alive...

19:22.599 --> 19:23.605
not literally.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.546
Long live civil disobedience.

19:29.371 --> 19:30.377
Crap.

19:34.510 --> 19:37.437
Where does this school get off
denying same-sex couples?

19:37.890 --> 19:39.817
It is the administration's prerogative

19:39.950 --> 19:41.748
to uphold certain moral standards.

19:42.232 --> 19:45.404
Certain moral standards
or your own personal prejudices?

19:45.537 --> 19:48.154
Mrs. Trager,
I am principal of this school.

19:48.306 --> 19:50.044
If you think you can do a better job,

19:50.224 --> 19:51.534
I invite you to try,

19:51.679 --> 19:53.653
but given the fact
you've managed to raise

19:53.794 --> 19:55.233
two vandals and a petty thief,

19:55.353 --> 19:58.045
I recommend you stay focused
on your own children,

19:58.298 --> 20:01.601
none of whom will be allowed
to attend the dance.

20:09.634 --> 20:11.116
Sorry you got busted.

20:11.301 --> 20:13.617
Oh, whatever. It was worth it.

20:13.907 --> 20:15.105
I feel bad for Kyle, though.

20:15.251 --> 20:16.906
He really wants to go to the dance.

20:17.058 --> 20:18.820
Which brings me to Phase 2.

20:19.234 --> 20:20.468
There's a Phase 2?

20:20.741 --> 20:21.785
There is now.

20:23.050 --> 20:24.325
Not that I don't appreciate

20:24.481 --> 20:26.977
your commitment to the cause,
but why this one, specifically?

20:27.219 --> 20:28.662
I get it from my moms.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.090
Moms?

20:30.430 --> 20:31.436
Yes.

20:31.797 --> 20:32.810
Plural.

20:34.706 --> 20:36.891
Let's just say
I don't have a lot of tolerance

20:37.024 --> 20:38.638
for other people's closed-minded crap.

20:39.710 --> 20:42.435
I don't understand
how you tolerate my brother, then.

20:42.584 --> 20:45.489
I like to think of Josh
as a perpetual work in progress.

20:45.823 --> 20:48.139
Changing the world
one moron at a time, huh?

20:48.684 --> 20:50.013
Something like that.

20:51.457 --> 20:54.609
Well, then, count me in for Phase 2,

20:54.768 --> 20:56.173
except I can't get suspended.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.706
I don't think SuperMom
could bail me out twice in one week.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.797
Speaking of SuperMom,
mine are both booked,

21:02.016 --> 21:05.267
so do you think yours would be willing

21:05.403 --> 21:07.340
to chaperone
a non-school-sponsored event

21:07.469 --> 21:08.912
the same night as the Spring Fling?

21:09.085 --> 21:10.756
Well, like an alterna-dance?

21:11.747 --> 21:13.323
Something where everyone's welcome,

21:13.538 --> 21:15.303
no matter who their date is.

21:15.491 --> 21:16.985
The Swing Spring Fling.

21:17.105 --> 21:19.117
I love it, and so will my mom.

21:19.261 --> 21:21.500
She's dying to put
Principal Hooper in his place.

21:21.661 --> 21:24.206
There's hope for you Tragers after all.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.546
What's up, buddy?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.305
Lori's planning another dance.

21:32.795 --> 21:33.802
I heard.

21:33.936 --> 21:36.784
And according to Mom,
I'm still on clean-up duty.

21:36.951 --> 21:38.470
There's no justice.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.983
I need dancing shoes.

21:41.747 --> 21:43.892
As opposed to any other kind of shoes?

21:44.129 --> 21:47.015
Hillary said I need to put on
my dancing shoes for Amanda,

21:47.199 --> 21:48.339
except I don't have any.

21:48.576 --> 21:49.970
Dude, it's just an express...

21:50.120 --> 21:52.366
Expression. I knew that.

21:52.997 --> 21:54.004
Sure.

21:54.499 --> 21:55.505
Except...

21:55.961 --> 21:56.967
Yes?

21:57.457 --> 21:59.356
If there's no shoes to help me dance,

21:59.594 --> 22:01.512
- how do I do it?
- Do what?

22:02.132 --> 22:04.448
- Dance.
- You don't know how to dance?

22:04.681 --> 22:06.102
I don't know. I've never tried.

22:06.222 --> 22:08.496
Well, then, my large-brained friend,

22:08.997 --> 22:10.459
allow me to teach you.

22:23.420 --> 22:24.996
You're the smart one.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.049
Music is made of beats.

22:27.290 --> 22:29.341
Get the beats, you'll get the rhythm.

22:39.710 --> 22:41.050
Uh, right, uh...

22:42.750 --> 22:44.491
you got to, you know...

22:45.231 --> 22:46.351
feel it.

22:47.509 --> 22:48.515
I feel it.

22:49.147 --> 22:51.324
4/4, 4/4, bop, bop, bop.

22:51.476 --> 22:53.373
No, I mean feel the song.

22:53.956 --> 22:56.387
Express yourself. Dancing is freedom.

23:03.195 --> 23:05.246
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

23:10.464 --> 23:12.591
Uh, you're not feeling it, man.

23:13.168 --> 23:16.684
You'll be fine if you dance next to
people who know what they do. Otherwise,

23:17.009 --> 23:20.075
I think we found the first thing
you suck at. Check it.

23:34.648 --> 23:35.712
We're dancing together.

23:36.036 --> 23:37.137
I'm dancing.

23:37.508 --> 23:38.514
You're copying.

23:41.480 --> 23:44.749
So why do you have a problem
with other guys dancing together?

23:44.917 --> 23:46.664
- Totally different, dude.
- Why?

23:47.281 --> 23:49.369
We're not having one
of those conversations now.

23:49.707 --> 23:51.017
I know why you don't like it,

23:51.463 --> 23:53.931
but you're the one who said
dancing's all about freedom.

23:54.126 --> 23:55.930
So shouldn't everybody
be able to enjoy it?

24:03.870 --> 24:07.757
Jessi, you want to be my first
ticket buyer for the alterna-dance?

24:07.975 --> 24:09.760
I assume you're going with Declan.

24:11.179 --> 24:12.261
I'm not going.

24:13.300 --> 24:14.303
Oh?

24:14.659 --> 24:16.311
My sister won't let me go with him.

24:17.148 --> 24:18.154
Why not?

24:19.320 --> 24:21.059
She has a lot of rules.

24:22.248 --> 24:23.331
She's stric, huh?

24:23.483 --> 24:24.660
She's really strict.

24:24.943 --> 24:26.747
She's always telling me what to do.

24:28.795 --> 24:30.466
Where are your parents?

24:31.650 --> 24:34.069
My mom's crazy, and
my dad couldn't handle it,

24:34.240 --> 24:35.778
so Emily takes care of me now.

24:36.802 --> 24:38.378
Wow. That's rough.

24:39.237 --> 24:41.060
Yea, we haven't always
had the easiest life.

24:41.742 --> 24:43.109
And Emily's all I have.

24:44.340 --> 24:46.862
She loves me, and that's
why I have to listen to her.

24:51.140 --> 24:52.933
But I really want to go to the dance.

24:56.510 --> 24:58.168
I am a horrible person.

24:58.674 --> 25:00.098
- You are? - Yes.

25:00.590 --> 25:03.191
I'm sorry. I have not
been very nice to you.

25:03.611 --> 25:04.617
You've been nice.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.620
Not inside my head.

25:09.020 --> 25:10.337
Let me make it up to you.

25:10.458 --> 25:12.130
Nobody should have to sit at home alone

25:12.270 --> 25:14.814
when everyone else
is out with their friends.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.514
You can come with me and Hillary.

25:20.118 --> 25:21.124
I can?

25:21.904 --> 25:22.919
Sure.

25:23.138 --> 25:24.153
Why not?

25:24.550 --> 25:25.792
We'll be a threesome.

25:30.543 --> 25:31.550
Dinner's in ten.

25:31.673 --> 25:34.532
I have to dine and dash.
I got to meet the decorating committee.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.279
I think I like activist Lori.
She reminds me of someone I know.

25:39.250 --> 25:40.506
By the wa, Mom,

25:40.639 --> 25:42.534
I invited Jessi
to come to the dance with me.

25:42.654 --> 25:44.202
- Lori...
- I know you don't like it,

25:44.322 --> 25:45.832
and believe me, I'm surprising myself,

25:45.952 --> 25:48.287
but she's like a lost little
puppy or something.

25:48.453 --> 25:50.276
I just feel sorry for her.

25:51.460 --> 25:52.713
Must be genetic.

25:56.190 --> 25:58.773
She just used heredity
as an excuse not to obey her mother.

25:58.944 --> 26:00.140
Yeah, well, she's good.

26:00.939 --> 26:03.612
The situation with Jessi is different
than it was with Kyle.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.940
There's something about her
that worries you?

26:07.510 --> 26:10.080
I couldn't discuss it even if
there were. That's my point.

26:11.538 --> 26:14.263
Point made, although I think
Lori's instincts are pretty good.

26:14.423 --> 26:15.752
Must be genetic.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.413
Whoa. Nice moves.

26:19.553 --> 26:22.306
I taught him everything
he knows, literally.

26:23.234 --> 26:25.189
- Excited about your big date?
- Yes.

26:25.324 --> 26:28.194
Uh-oh. Here comes Dad's
fatherly advice about dating.

26:28.345 --> 26:30.074
Well, let's hope it lands
better on Kyle,

26:30.194 --> 26:31.858
seeing as how yours never happened.

26:33.223 --> 26:34.615
A dagger in the heart, Dad.

26:34.748 --> 26:36.268
You know, I'm really impressed that

26:36.421 --> 26:38.747
your friend Andy helped
put the whole night together.

26:38.885 --> 26:41.334
She probably only did it
so I wouldn't get off garbage duty.

26:41.706 --> 26:42.808
Somehow I doubt that.

26:43.173 --> 26:45.280
Plus, if you hadn't felt it
necessary to steal...

26:45.433 --> 26:46.800
- Borrow.
- Whatever.

26:47.118 --> 26:48.257
You could be going with her.

26:48.723 --> 26:50.375
Why would I want to go with her?

26:52.530 --> 26:53.968
You're all crazy.

27:03.094 --> 27:04.100
What happened?

27:05.186 --> 27:08.413
Principal Hooper called my mom,
and she came home early.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.750
I'm grounded, I can't go to dance.

27:27.570 --> 27:29.165
People actually came.

27:29.798 --> 27:32.114
Hils, you are such a pessimist
about the human condition.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.751
We got our message out there.
Of course people came.

27:34.871 --> 27:37.815
Yeah, plus we sold our tickets
for half the price of the other dance.

27:38.104 --> 27:39.471
Yeah, that helped.

27:41.188 --> 27:42.745
What are we doing here again?

27:42.960 --> 27:44.061
Supporting Lori.

27:45.607 --> 27:46.614
Why?

27:47.811 --> 27:49.709
Because the other night
I made out with Jessi

27:49.842 --> 27:53.063
while Lori was in the next room
singing a song about our breakup.

27:54.390 --> 27:56.067
Whoa, that's, uh...

27:56.548 --> 27:58.560
- that's a move worthy of me.
- Great.

27:59.339 --> 28:01.048
Now I really feel good about myself.

28:05.060 --> 28:08.109
Uh, I'm... I'm gonna need
something stronger if that's...

28:10.827 --> 28:13.201
When did you two hop
on the lesbian granola bus?

28:14.131 --> 28:16.580
I don't know. Hils,
you want to give it a try?

28:16.724 --> 28:19.817
Yeah, I've always wanted
to be a granola lesbian...

28:25.920 --> 28:29.493
...if only to never kiss
homophobic cheating jerks like you.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.969
You busted your new moves yet?

28:42.186 --> 28:43.420
I don't think I like dancing.

28:44.412 --> 28:46.026
Because you're not feeling it,

28:46.479 --> 28:49.555
which is understandable,
given your dateless status.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.026
But you're more than welcome
to join me on clean-up duty.

28:54.119 --> 28:55.809
These Sour Patch Kids are different.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.456
They're extreme... like my punishment.

29:04.750 --> 29:07.227
People, the Earth is not your trash can.

29:15.300 --> 29:16.300
Ow.

29:16.999 --> 29:18.518
Static electricity.

29:19.435 --> 29:21.930
An electrical charge
caused by an imbalance of electrons

29:22.090 --> 29:23.460
on the surface of a material.

29:25.144 --> 29:26.264
You like science.

29:26.766 --> 29:27.772
I guess.

29:29.094 --> 29:30.841
How did you know
how to fix Josh's radio?

29:31.444 --> 29:33.457
Sometimes I just know things.

29:36.030 --> 29:37.036
Me, too.

29:40.150 --> 29:41.157
You made it.

29:41.336 --> 29:42.343
I snuck out.

29:42.571 --> 29:43.577
Hi, Declan.

29:44.423 --> 29:45.430
Hey.

29:46.010 --> 29:47.709
- You thirsty?
- Sure.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.624
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:57.766 --> 29:59.892
I see I'm not the only
workaholic in the company.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.482
Oh, all work, no play.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.657
Well, it looks like
your evil plan is working.

30:07.590 --> 30:08.594
What?

30:08.970 --> 30:11.286
Jessi. She and my daughter Lori
really hit it off.

30:11.868 --> 30:13.738
Oh, yeah. That's great.

30:13.881 --> 30:16.410
I'm going to the dance now to help out
Nicole. You can join us

30:16.530 --> 30:18.618
and check out the budding
friendship for yourself.

30:19.389 --> 30:20.623
Jessi's not there.

30:22.127 --> 30:24.311
I'm pretty sure she is.
Lori said she was going.

30:31.690 --> 30:33.332
Social as ever, I see.

30:38.290 --> 30:40.507
- You missed something.
- Where?

30:43.840 --> 30:44.848
There.

30:46.049 --> 30:47.074
Very funny.

30:50.704 --> 30:52.185
So how's the hot dates?

30:52.472 --> 30:55.339
I guess you'll just have
to see for yourself, won't you?

30:55.806 --> 30:58.424
I hope the view from the garbage cans
is good enough.

30:59.710 --> 31:02.948
- It's not really my scene anyway.
- What about it isn't your scene?

31:03.373 --> 31:05.728
- You know.
- You don't like gay people.

31:06.760 --> 31:07.900
That's not what I meant.

31:09.039 --> 31:10.918
Oh. I see. You're gay.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.064
What? No.

31:13.476 --> 31:16.191
It's coo, though. I'm hip with the gays.

31:16.586 --> 31:17.592
I'm not gay.

31:18.315 --> 31:20.366
Bummer. It might make you cooler.

31:46.596 --> 31:48.115
- You're here.
- I am.

31:48.820 --> 31:49.884
How? Why?

31:50.124 --> 31:52.763
I snuck out.
Long live civil disobedience.

31:53.706 --> 31:54.902
Come on. Let's dance.

32:02.233 --> 32:03.239
She's good.

32:05.100 --> 32:06.112
Yeah.

32:06.564 --> 32:08.557
Shame you can't be out there.

32:09.057 --> 32:10.064
Yeah.

32:10.458 --> 32:13.470
I guess if you agreed to some
community service at my discretion,

32:13.620 --> 32:16.299
I could lift your punishment
for one dance.

32:17.710 --> 32:20.324
I don't know.
She looks a little busy with her dates.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.223
Uh, somehow I think
she'll make the time.

32:29.332 --> 32:30.339
Go.

32:54.926 --> 32:55.933
Go for it.

33:36.970 --> 33:39.700
Oh. I think it's a hundred
degrees in here.

33:39.830 --> 33:42.414
This is fun. Thank you for inviting me.

33:46.481 --> 33:48.323
That's a really pretty necklace.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.200
Thanks. It's a remnant
from my Declan days.

33:55.536 --> 33:56.542
He gave it to you?

33:56.994 --> 33:58.001
Yeah.

34:01.155 --> 34:03.130
Do you wish
that you were still with him?

34:05.200 --> 34:07.200
Honestl, sometimes.

34:08.230 --> 34:09.561
We didn't end very well, so

34:09.694 --> 34:12.771
there's always gonna be part of me
that wishes things were different.

34:12.931 --> 34:15.913
But he's moved on, obviously.

34:19.780 --> 34:21.384
Anyway, back to work.

34:38.139 --> 34:39.696
You're a good dancer.

34:40.650 --> 34:42.074
This part's easy.

34:42.666 --> 34:44.223
- Slow dancing is...
- No.

34:45.770 --> 34:47.203
Dancing with you.

35:09.710 --> 35:12.900
I don't think Charlie's very happy
to see us dancing.

35:13.658 --> 35:15.652
Who cares what Charlie thinks?

35:17.062 --> 35:18.296
Do you mean that?

35:22.053 --> 35:23.287
You mean that.

35:27.039 --> 35:29.052
Lori still wants to be with you.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.004
I don't think so.

35:32.238 --> 35:34.307
Do you still want to be with her?

35:34.892 --> 35:36.601
I'm with you, aren't I?

35:41.110 --> 35:42.187
You made it.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.096
- Emily.
- Hi.

35:45.953 --> 35:46.997
We have a little problem.

35:49.774 --> 35:51.748
- Jesse! What did I tell you?
- Oh!

35:51.886 --> 35:53.481
- Hey!
- Stay out of this.

35:54.327 --> 35:55.808
You're not supposed to be here.

35:56.054 --> 35:57.383
You're hurting my arms.

35:57.679 --> 35:59.722
- Emil, why don't we all...
- I'll handle this.

35:59.842 --> 36:00.843
Get your things.

36:01.098 --> 36:03.010
- You're coming home now.
- I don't want to.

36:03.170 --> 36:05.024
You don't get to make those decisions.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.636
- Did you see that?
- No.

36:08.356 --> 36:10.141
- The lights.
- What lights?

36:13.996 --> 36:15.002
Oh.

36:17.816 --> 36:18.823
Whoa.

36:24.554 --> 36:25.731
Jess, we're leaving.

36:26.544 --> 36:28.063
You can't tell me what to do!

36:45.687 --> 36:48.330
Doesn't look like the power's
gonna come back on.

36:48.750 --> 36:50.893
It's for the best anyways.
It's pumpkin hour.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.113
Time for me to get home,

36:53.271 --> 36:55.322
unless I want to be
grounded until I'm 50.

36:56.169 --> 36:57.707
Well, I hope that doesn't happen.

36:59.660 --> 37:01.720
I'd like to go out with you again,

37:01.880 --> 37:02.936
before you're 50.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.028
I'd like that, too.

37:10.810 --> 37:11.825
Good night.

37:13.530 --> 37:14.546
Good night.

37:28.057 --> 37:29.975
Go ahead. Throw
the trash at my feet again.

37:32.590 --> 37:35.268
- What are you doing?
- I think it's called cleaning.

37:36.076 --> 37:38.373
No. You're being nice.
You're never nice.

37:38.645 --> 37:40.202
I'm totally nice.

37:40.968 --> 37:42.731
You make fun of me, you put me down,

37:42.851 --> 37:44.951
and you always have
to have the last word.

37:45.149 --> 37:47.276
I thought that was... our thing.

37:48.710 --> 37:49.748
We have a thing?

37:49.990 --> 37:51.793
Well, not like a "thing" thing,

37:51.947 --> 37:53.067
but you know...

37:53.523 --> 37:54.529
a vibe.

37:55.347 --> 37:56.391
A pattern.

37:57.669 --> 37:58.676
A thing.

37:59.380 --> 38:00.380
Yeah.

38:01.570 --> 38:02.570
Cool.

38:04.762 --> 38:06.243
Oh, yeah, your dates, they're...

38:06.399 --> 38:07.842
Gay, yes.

38:09.270 --> 38:12.340
Actually, I was gonna say
they're pretty cool guys.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.816
Go ahead. Get in the last word.

38:18.900 --> 38:19.906
No need.

38:30.604 --> 38:32.787
Thwarted by an electrical snafu.

38:36.866 --> 38:38.916
Other than the drama,
it was a pretty great night.

38:39.076 --> 38:40.443
You were certainly enjoying it.

38:41.053 --> 38:42.648
Sarcasm, party of one.

38:44.189 --> 38:46.202
It's okay. I deserve it.

38:46.767 --> 38:49.539
What, because,
on top of everything else,

38:49.699 --> 38:53.155
you bailed on me right before
my first ever live performance?

38:53.530 --> 38:55.467
Yeah. Not your best moment.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.030
I'm really sorr, Lori.

38:58.223 --> 38:59.325
I wanted to be there.

38:59.476 --> 39:00.767
You were there.

39:01.171 --> 39:03.697
And then... suddenly you weren't.

39:06.130 --> 39:08.147
I can't explain what happened.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.129
I've been in a bad place for so long,

39:11.771 --> 39:13.859
and then Jessi was there, and

39:14.703 --> 39:16.715
somehow it was an escape from it all.

39:17.036 --> 39:18.593
She makes you feel better.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.095
She makes me... forget.

39:24.290 --> 39:25.324
Forget me?

39:26.059 --> 39:27.350
I don't want to forget you.

39:29.334 --> 39:30.644
But with everything else...

39:32.650 --> 39:34.662
being with her
feels better than being alone.

39:40.730 --> 39:42.224
What exactly happened

39:42.794 --> 39:43.990
between you and Kyle?

39:44.210 --> 39:46.432
I never understood
what went wrong with you two.

39:48.442 --> 39:49.638
Besides you...

39:50.950 --> 39:53.289
Kyle was the only real friend
I ever had.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.317
I guess...

39:57.410 --> 39:59.563
we didn't trust each other
as much as we thought.

40:01.663 --> 40:03.201
Romance interrupted.

40:04.030 --> 40:05.207
You and your words.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.268
Let there be light.

40:10.905 --> 40:12.728
Ladies and gentlemen,

40:13.651 --> 40:14.847
boys and boys,

40:15.781 --> 40:19.446
thank you so much
for coming out... literally...

40:19.642 --> 40:21.598
to this very gay event.

40:22.586 --> 40:23.706
And by gay,

40:24.730 --> 40:27.090
I... I don't... I don't mean happy.
I mean,

40:27.280 --> 40:29.623
oh, so very homosexual.

40:32.720 --> 40:33.897
Knock it off.

40:34.604 --> 40:35.952
Why? I'm just messing around.

40:36.170 --> 40:37.252
No, you're being an idiot.

40:39.731 --> 40:41.440
You should remember
who your friends are.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.183
You're right.

40:48.930 --> 40:49.938
I should.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.085
Declan.

41:09.798 --> 41:10.804
What's up?

41:12.475 --> 41:13.747
I want to tell you everything.

41:17.480 --> 41:18.860
I don't get it. Why now?

41:19.424 --> 41:21.905
There's someone else who knows
my secret. I thought

41:22.027 --> 41:24.096
- he was the only one I could rely on.
- Tom Foss.

41:24.607 --> 41:25.613
How do you know that?

41:27.556 --> 41:29.236
I think there's something
you should see.

41:38.350 --> 41:41.423
Saw the two of you together.
Started digging around.

41:42.238 --> 41:43.624
He left these for me...

41:45.635 --> 41:46.812
as a warning.

41:48.373 --> 41:50.291
- A warning?
- To back off.

41:56.944 --> 42:00.198
- Foss did this?
- He obviously doesn't want me involved.

42:00.578 --> 42:02.952
But I'm in this. I always have been.

42:04.420 --> 42:06.595
If you want me to know the truth,

42:06.840 --> 42:08.433
I'm ready to hear it.

42:11.331 --> 42:12.337
Okay.

42:13.305 --> 42:19.876
