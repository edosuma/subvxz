hanging out or something.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.873
I did knock.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.875
Turn that crap down

00:51.719 --> 00:53.952
Who's gonna rape you, fool?

00:53.954 --> 00:55.787
A crack-head?

00:55.789 --> 00:57.723
Ha, laugh it up.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.125
You know I got honeys
lining up for me anyways.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.026
Right.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.662
What do you want fool?

01:05.432 --> 01:07.566
Have you seen my Maxim?

01:07.568 --> 01:08.467
No.

01:09.770 --> 01:13.605
How about that old Playboy
you had lying around?

01:13.607 --> 01:16.675
Nah man, I threw that
out like two weeks ago.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.477
The pages got sticky.

01:19.546 --> 01:23.048
Why, what are you
trying to do with it?

01:23.050 --> 01:25.450
You know that chick I
had over here last night?

01:25.452 --> 01:28.020
Yeah bro, she looked cool.

01:28.022 --> 01:30.422
She cut out after
using the bathroom.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.057
Hey, you ain't
blaming me, right?

01:32.059 --> 01:33.125
I went straight to my room.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.626
I didn't cock block.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.762
Nah, it wasn't you.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.630
It's just like, I
don't understand.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.232
She was all over me.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.668
She had me hard as a villain,

01:42.670 --> 01:45.537
then she excused herself,
used the restroom.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.306
You know, I thought
she was gonna like,

01:47.308 --> 01:49.241
freshen up or something.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.742
But then she cut out on me

01:50.744 --> 01:52.577
and left me with this
raging case of blue balls.

01:52.579 --> 01:53.779
What?

01:53.781 --> 01:54.813
Bitch didn't
even say bye, dude.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.815
That's cold-blooded, fool.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.117
But that's the one thing
a girl won't put up with.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.086
A dirty toilet.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.855
Bro, you're the one that
pisses all over the place.

02:03.857 --> 02:07.359
Hey, I can't help it if I
piss sideways in the morning.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.728
It's the boner,
it's not my fault.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.897
It's your crooked dick, bro.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.800
Didn't your parents teach
you to piss on the Cheerio?

02:14.802 --> 02:17.602
Piss on the Cheerio,
what the fuck is that?

02:17.604 --> 02:19.171
Yeah, piss on the Cheerio.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.373
That's how parents
potty train little boys.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.808
They put a Cheerio in there,

02:22.810 --> 02:25.677
and they tell the boys to aim,

02:25.679 --> 02:27.379
make it into a little game.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.481
And that's how you learned?

02:29.483 --> 02:32.084
No man, they were
always at work.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.719
My sister raised me.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.153
And they were always too lazy

02:35.155 --> 02:36.421
to show me how to do it right,

02:36.423 --> 02:38.023
so I just learned how
to piss sitting down,

02:38.025 --> 02:39.458
the way they did.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.194
Damn bro, you better
keep that shit to yourself.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.328
TMI for real.

02:44.431 --> 02:47.032
What do you need the
magazines for, anyway?

02:47.034 --> 02:51.970
Fuck, my nuts are fucking
killing me right now, man.

02:51.972 --> 02:55.941
I'm just gonna fucking go to
the pot and bust a quick one.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.076
Again, homie, TMI, TMI.

02:59.847 --> 03:04.082
Hey, what about those
department store ads?

03:04.084 --> 03:07.119
You know, JC Penney,
Or Macy's or something.

03:07.121 --> 03:10.622
The department store
ads, what the fuck?

03:10.624 --> 03:12.758
The bra ads man, titty.

03:13.594 --> 03:14.960
You got issues, bro.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.662
It's a good things
I threw those out.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.398
Man.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.470

some chick on the cover.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.371
Oh yeah?

03:27.141 --> 03:28.407

03:28.409 --> 03:30.575

the side of the couch.

03:30.577 --> 03:32.377

03:32.379 --> 03:33.612

09:41.715 --> 09:44.015
I still don't know why he
wanted to become a priest.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.216
But he sure looks
like he's ready

09:45.218 --> 09:47.352
to take some confessions.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.688
He looks official.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.123
You're right, though.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.259
This motherfucker probably
only became a priest

09:54.261 --> 09:56.961
to listen to these
bitches' dirty confessions.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.497
That's what I would do.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.422
to go green, right?

11:31.424 --> 11:34.058
Yeah, but now
they going all white.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.193
It does snow there.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.196
Yeah, it's gonna snow
like a motherfucker

11:38.198 --> 11:39.597
there this year.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.467
Hey so, this long
ass break you're on.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.302
You ever gonna
come help me work?

11:44.304 --> 11:46.971
Man, I told you
I'm constipated.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.540
When I stand up it hurts, man.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.842
It's only been 30 minutes.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.844
Besides, right here on the box

11:52.846 --> 11:55.580
it says you gotta
take two pills.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.882
Oh so you want me shitting
my ass all day, right?

11:57.884 --> 11:58.716
That's the whole point.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.486
Then why don't you
stop slacking off

12:01.488 --> 12:02.754
and answer that damn phone.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.222
Says the motherfucker
sitting on his ass

12:04.224 --> 12:06.357
not doing nothing,
not helping me clean.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.159
You're damn right, and I'm
gonna sit on my black ass.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.694
I got another five minutes,

12:09.696 --> 12:11.296
so why don't you
shut the fuck up

12:11.298 --> 12:12.830
and answer the phone?

12:12.832 --> 12:14.399
You always seem
to be on break.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.800
Hey man.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.135
Bombalicious.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.537
Products for the
mind, body, and soul.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.638
Soul!

12:20.640 --> 12:22.106
What it do, boy?

12:22.108 --> 12:24.509
Hey what's up, Arnie?

12:24.511 --> 12:25.777
I'm just here trying to get

12:25.779 --> 12:26.978
this lazy bastard
to get off his ass

12:26.980 --> 12:29.681
and help me do something.

12:29.683 --> 12:32.583
Man, that's just
Jimmy being Jimmy.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.452
He won't do shit
unless it involves

12:34.454 --> 12:36.421
money, bitches, and weed.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.957
It is true, that's true.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.592
I know that fucking
crazy ass Mexican

12:41.594 --> 12:43.361
ain't talking about
someone being lazy

12:43.363 --> 12:44.595
as much as he is.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.197
Hey hey, relax Spike Lee.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.598
He just described you to a T.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.500
Money, bitches, weed.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.035
Well yeah, I don't need it in

12:51.037 --> 12:53.371
that particular order, you
know what I mean?

12:53.373 --> 12:54.639
So what's up?

12:54.641 --> 12:56.174
I just wanted to roll through

12:56.176 --> 12:59.744
and pick up a Bumble sack
of that Blueberry Purp.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.813
You guys are not out, are you?

13:01.815 --> 13:04.315
That fat motherfucker didn't
wipe you out again, did he?

13:04.317 --> 13:05.650
Blueberry Purp.

13:05.652 --> 13:06.951
Yeah he better get over here.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.220
We got a lot in right
from East Palo Alto.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.488
Better hurry up
before Zuckerburg

13:10.490 --> 13:11.522
gets it all, man.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.757
He's been wiping us out.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.926
Nice, I'll be
through in about 30.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.895
Just gonna pick up some
breakfast burritos first.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.130
Do you want any?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.598
No no, I don't
want any burritos.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.799
Hey, and when you get here,

13:21.801 --> 13:23.401
you better have some
fetti too, okay?

13:23.403 --> 13:25.036
'Cause this shit ain't free.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.604
Yeah.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.406
Player's price though, right?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.508
Of course man, you're fam.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.044
Cool, don't trip
man, I got you.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.612
I just got paid.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.080
What do you mean paid?

13:36.082 --> 13:38.349
Paid like you got a job?

13:38.351 --> 13:39.484
Yeah man.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.651
He says he has a job.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.153
No.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.755
Yeah man.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.757
It pays hella good.

13:45.759 --> 13:48.259
I only work on weekends.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.527
Okay I'll bite.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.728
Doing what?

13:50.730 --> 13:53.398
Man, I ain't telling you shit.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.966
You always hatin'.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.168
You dress up like a clown

13:57.170 --> 13:59.203
doing kids birthday parties.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.071
No.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.709
You just said you only
work on the weekends.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.045
Stop being a pussy,
just tell me.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.447
Damn, all right man, shit.

14:10.817 --> 14:13.284
I work at the old folks home.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.352
That's it?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.753
That's it.

14:15.755 --> 14:18.189
What'd he say?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.190
You're lying.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.792
Anyways, when you get here,

14:20.794 --> 14:22.527
I'll get it out
of you, trust me.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.361
Oscar.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.295
Yes.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.530
You're telling me to hurry,

14:25.532 --> 14:27.265
but you're taking
up all my time.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.533
Just hurry up.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.701
Hey you better save me
some of that Blueberry.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.170
I got you.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.237
All right.

14:33.239 --> 14:34.238
All right.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.073
Late.

14:35.075 --> 14:35.907
Later.

14:35.909 --> 14:36.774
Is he coming?

14:36.776 --> 14:37.809
He's coming.

14:37.811 --> 14:38.976
Fucking weirdo.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.246
Give me my towel back.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.751
Go man, do something!

14:46.753 --> 14:47.819
Damn dude.

14:47.821 --> 14:48.920

So, how many years did
your twin brother serve?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.263
My twin brother only
served three years.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.764
I got 10.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.566
I was a cop.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.236
They wanted to make an example.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.239
10 long years.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.276
But I'm almost done.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.378
Been in this
pre-release unit for,

15:47.380 --> 15:49.313
I don't know, a week?

15:49.315 --> 15:51.716
Any moment now, I
get my life back.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.718
How about you?

15:53.720 --> 15:57.221
Those whackas gave
me seven bloody years

15:57.223 --> 15:59.056
in this hell hole.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.459
All I could wish for
was the destruction

16:01.461 --> 16:04.095
of Barney Bumble
and his ghetto crew.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.397
I won't have my life back
until I've destroyed his.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.932
You ain't gotta tell me.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.767
I'd kill every single one
of those motherfuckers,

16:09.769 --> 16:12.003
if I'd get my hands on 'em.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.771
I don't know about
the Barney fella,

16:13.773 --> 16:15.473
but because of his friends,

16:15.475 --> 16:17.942
I lost my job, got
sent to prison,

16:17.944 --> 16:20.478
and all the money me
and my brother ever made

16:20.480 --> 16:22.914
was gone just like that.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.415
I was smart about that.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.752
I put my assets in my
family's name overseas.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.221
I used what I could in
here to make friends.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.089
The only friend I
had was my brother.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.691
Where's your brother now?

16:33.693 --> 16:35.860
Eh, he moved back east.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.029
East Oakland?

16:39.032 --> 16:40.498
No, East Coast.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.802
Couldn't stand
California anymore.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.671
Poor bastard had to
toss a few salads

16:46.673 --> 16:48.639
to survive in here, ah.

16:48.641 --> 16:53.711
We've all had to do some
undesirable things in this place.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.880
So, what about you?

16:55.882 --> 16:58.015
How did a ex-cop
survive in here?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.617
Are you kidding me?

16:59.619 --> 17:02.620
They put me in protective
custody as soon as I touched down

17:02.622 --> 17:04.521
Lucky Bobby.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.026
Bobby?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.595
I forget how
misinformed you Yanks are.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.796
Bobby is,

17:11.798 --> 17:13.731
what do you that
call in your, hood?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.366
Po Po, Police, yes.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.336
I don't know about that.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.238
I might have been a
PC but I had to grow

17:20.240 --> 17:22.006
eyes in the back of my head.

17:22.008 --> 17:25.076
seemed like every single
inmate had it out for me.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.911
But I've been lucky, I guess.

17:26.913 --> 17:30.848
If you want to call it luck
being locked up 23 hours

17:30.850 --> 17:32.583
a day in a single cell.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.218
Shit!

17:34.220 --> 17:36.487
So How could your
brother feel now

17:36.489 --> 17:39.490
about those white guys
that locked him up?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.459
Is he still is livid as you are?

17:41.461 --> 17:43.661
I don't think so.

17:43.663 --> 17:44.895
He moved on.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.097
He started a family.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.766
I barely hear from him anymore.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.869
Every once in a while he
puts money on my books

17:51.871 --> 17:53.271
for my birthday.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.373
I miss him.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.644
Well, let me tell
you something, Evans.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.680
I'm in the P.C unit as
well, awaiting release.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.783
I have a friend outside who
was released a few months back.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.685
I set him up.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.755
We have a place
to stay and a car.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.824
And first thing I'm
doing is the undoing

18:13.826 --> 18:16.560
of the Bumble and
his ghetto friend.

18:16.562 --> 18:18.029
Will you join me?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.998
Hell fucking
yes I'll join you.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.833
Pip pip and all
the good stuff.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.935
Chap, chapity chap, chap!

18:24.937 --> 18:25.936
Right on.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.489
What are you doing?

18:45.491 --> 18:47.058
Cruisin' cousin.

18:47.894 --> 18:48.859
Yeah, but

18:50.063 --> 18:51.562
why are you bobbing your head?

18:51.564 --> 18:52.997
There's no music on.

18:52.999 --> 18:56.233
The music is in
my head, Yadadamean?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.004
That's fucking crazy man.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.139
You don't hear it bro?

19:04.911 --> 19:06.577
This shit slammin'.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.782
I wanna put some real
music on 'cause people

19:11.784 --> 19:14.852
are gonna think
we're weird, man.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.238
Turtle!

20:08.641 --> 20:09.540
Oh shit.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.878
Relax bro, I come in peace.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.179
I'm bearing gifts.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.717
Proceed.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.685
I know I only owe you
two bucks but I figured

20:21.687 --> 20:25.923
$50 should cover the interest
and we could be good.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.591
Oh, is that what you thought?

20:27.593 --> 20:30.961
Man that's 11 years,
that's 50 bucks, take it?

20:30.963 --> 20:31.862
Truce?

20:38.104 --> 20:38.936
Fuck it.

20:38.938 --> 20:39.770
Truce.

20:39.772 --> 20:40.704
Yeah, awesome.

20:40.706 --> 20:41.972
Can't wait.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.541
I've been wanting to
come here so long.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.310
Heard you guys got the fattest
stacks and best weed in Cali.

20:46.312 --> 20:47.611
That is true.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.015
All right man, what
can we do for you?

20:51.017 --> 20:52.550
I don't know, what
do you recommend?

20:52.552 --> 20:53.818
How much you got?

20:53.820 --> 20:56.287
I got two stacks right now.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.359
Two stacks.

21:02.361 --> 21:05.629
All right, well, we're gonna
start him with some Einstein.

21:05.631 --> 21:06.764
'cause that shit is lit.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.932
True.

21:07.934 --> 21:08.866
Then
we're gonna move on

21:08.868 --> 21:10.100
to the blueberry adits, nice.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.268
Don't forget
about the blueberry.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.170
Why is it called blueberry?

21:13.172 --> 21:15.339
A few years back some
brothers buried some bud,

21:15.341 --> 21:16.874
next to a blueberry bush.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.342
So now that shit
comes up smelling

21:18.344 --> 21:19.543
and tasting like blueberry.

21:19.545 --> 21:20.377
So good.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.212
For real?

21:21.214 --> 21:22.146
Yeah.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.114
But but, last but not least,

21:24.116 --> 21:25.816
you gotta get the
Bumble broccoli.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.284
That's the shit that
put us on the map.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.385
Best weed ever.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.087
I heard of that shit bro,

21:30.089 --> 21:31.489
whatever happened to Bumble,

21:31.491 --> 21:32.923
I heard he's a legend
around these places.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.627
Yeah, he's still our
partner but we run the shop.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.996
Well, he's got other
things on his plate.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.965
He found a higher calling.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.032
Oh shit.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.267
He's a fucking priest?

21:43.269 --> 21:45.202
Well, at least that's
what he says he is.

21:45.204 --> 21:48.005
The Bay Area's high
society is now working

21:48.007 --> 21:50.708
for a higher authority.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.009
That's legit.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.478
Yeah.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.547
You know what, I just
thought of something.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.216
Being that it's his
first time here.

21:59.218 --> 22:00.885
I think we should hook him up

22:00.887 --> 22:03.087
with a free edible,
on the house.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.856
Go get the weed, I'll get
your edible for you buddy.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.625
Thanks, I appreciate it, bruh.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.593
Not a problem.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.395
All right, let's see.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.600
I'ma hook you up man.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.971
That's awesome, appreciate it.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.649
Here you go, man.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.783

22:32.785 --> 22:33.717
Hey, don't be smoking this

22:33.719 --> 22:34.785
shit all in all one day, okay.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.020
It might get you sick.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.054
Yeah man make sure
you choose a variety.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.789
A lot of passion in reason.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.791
For sure, for sure and again,

22:40.793 --> 22:43.060
I really appreciate it and
I'm glad were good man.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.062
Hey, we're good.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.605
You're a fucking
dick dude, I'm serious.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.472
Fuck him.

22:55.474 --> 22:56.774
He deserves it.

22:56.776 --> 22:57.608
Man he came here
with a truce man,

22:57.610 --> 22:58.442
Why would you do that?

22:58.444 --> 22:59.777
Still, fuck him.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.011
Yeah.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.346
Wait, what's the worse
that's gonna happen?

23:02.348 --> 23:03.581
He'll shit a little.

23:03.583 --> 23:06.283
Man how many pills
did you put in there?

23:06.285 --> 23:07.117
Six.

23:07.119 --> 23:07.952
Six?

23:07.954 --> 23:09.219

23:09.221 --> 23:12.356
Man, I just took one

23:12.358 --> 23:13.457
No shit?

23:13.459 --> 23:14.491
Pun intended.

23:15.428 --> 23:16.160
I'll see you in two hours.

23:16.162 --> 23:16.994

23:46.626 --> 23:47.858
Comin' or what?

23:47.860 --> 23:49.393

23:49.395 --> 23:51.629
Roll up some of this weed.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.265
Get me an egg and a
chorizo on a flour though.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.166
Yeah.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.104

34:28.000 --> 34:29.165
These white people.

35:03.969 --> 35:05.068
This is my good friend.

35:05.070 --> 35:05.969
Tommy Boy.

35:07.139 --> 35:09.072
Hey, nice to meet you.

35:09.074 --> 35:10.273
Likewise.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.008
Why do they call
you Tommy Boy?

35:12.010 --> 35:14.110
When I was first locked
up when I was 18,

35:14.112 --> 35:16.313
the inmates said I looked 12.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.682
First names Tommy,
hence Tommy Boy.

35:18.684 --> 35:21.017
Wow, that must have
been hard on you.

35:21.019 --> 35:24.487
It was pretty rough, till
I learned to defend myself.

35:24.489 --> 35:25.388
How so?

35:26.525 --> 35:28.258
I made shanks out of
anything I could find.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.492
Dirty razors.

35:29.494 --> 35:31.261
I didn't give a
fuck, throwaways.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.396
Cut a few dicks off literally.

35:33.398 --> 35:35.465
They learned after that.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.335
Enough with the
formalities, Tommy.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.937
What do you have on Bumble?

35:40.939 --> 35:43.239
Not gonna believe
this one, Larry.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.342
Well, let's have it.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.610
Word has it he's
in seminary school.

35:47.612 --> 35:49.679
What the hell is
seminary school?

35:49.681 --> 35:52.716
It's where one goes
to become a priest.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.417
You've got to be kidding.

35:54.419 --> 35:57.153
Barney Bumble the priest?

35:57.155 --> 35:59.389
Not kidding you, Larry.

35:59.391 --> 36:03.159
Word has he has a dispensary
opened up with a couple guys

36:03.161 --> 36:07.163
from his crew, the black
guy and the big fellow.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.966
And I guess Barney
joined the priesthood

36:09.968 --> 36:11.501
and called it his calling.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.170
Well, is the shop still open?

36:15.807 --> 36:19.776
Yes, its one of
Oakland's most finest.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.244
Well holy shit!

36:22.347 --> 36:23.680
No pun intended.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.981
I'm gobsmacked.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.183
Here you go again.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.386
What the hell is gobsmacked?

36:29.388 --> 36:31.788
Its astonished, astounded.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.624
You guys need
to speak English.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.494
How far is place
you've found us?

36:37.496 --> 36:42.332
It's about 20 minutes from
here, you wanna take a look?

36:43.602 --> 36:46.803
No, this establishment,
what's it called?

36:48.140 --> 36:52.909
You're gonna love this one,
it's called Bombalicious.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.445
The fuck is a a Bombalicious?

36:55.447 --> 36:58.848
Bumble and his ghetto
crew, I hate them.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.487
Bombalicious, ghetto.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.196
What's up man?

37:13.198 --> 37:15.165
Arnie, what's up man?

37:16.268 --> 37:17.133
Burrito?

37:17.135 --> 37:18.334
Hell no man.

37:18.336 --> 37:20.603
I had my steel cut
oatmeal this morning.

37:20.605 --> 37:21.871
Oatmeal?

37:21.873 --> 37:25.141
Yeah, that's why
I'm fucking cute.

37:25.143 --> 37:26.543
Anyway where's Jimmy at?

37:26.545 --> 37:29.546
In the shitter, for
the past 30 minutes.

37:29.548 --> 37:32.549
He was hella constipated
I gave him some ex-lax.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.517
he's finally catching up.

37:34.519 --> 37:37.353
I told that poo to stop
smoking so much weed, man,

37:37.355 --> 37:38.822
its gonna clog you up, you know?

37:38.824 --> 37:40.323
That's what that I said too

37:40.325 --> 37:42.392
but when you got all this on
display every day in your face

37:42.394 --> 37:43.593
makes it kinda hard.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.828
Shit!

37:44.830 --> 37:47.030
You guys got the whole
smorgasbord up in here.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.498
Smorgasbord bro.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.766
It's cool, You don't
have to use big words.

37:49.768 --> 37:50.834
You're good.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.237
It's the Einstein, gives
you brain power, you know?

37:54.239 --> 37:55.972
Brainpower.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.240
Whoa, what's up Arnie?

37:57.242 --> 37:59.275
Woo, man, I feel
so much better now.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.210
Look who it is.

38:00.212 --> 38:01.211
What's up, bruh?

38:01.213 --> 38:02.412
Hey, man, I told you.

38:02.414 --> 38:05.949
one of these for the
occasional constipations

38:05.951 --> 38:07.417
which you needed, correct?

38:07.419 --> 38:09.185
You sound like a damn
commercial all the time man.

38:09.187 --> 38:10.487
Stop it.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.354
Burrito?

38:11.356 --> 38:12.822
No, no, no, man.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.658
Oh no it's like already gotta
shit again already, so no.

38:15.660 --> 38:19.062
Why are you trying so hard
to get rid of that burrito?

38:19.064 --> 38:20.663
Its a long story, bro.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.198
I lost my appetite.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.368
Fucking bum pissed all over my
car at the fucking taco shop.

38:25.370 --> 38:26.903
Oh that's nasty, man.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.304
You always get through
the weirdest shit.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.539
You do.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.674
Yo, speaking of some
weird shit, remember

38:31.676 --> 38:33.576
that dude named Turtle?

38:33.578 --> 38:36.679
Oh yeah, Oscars always
had been chasing him.

38:36.681 --> 38:39.048
Yeah check it out.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.550
He did him wrong.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.785
What d'you do?

38:42.787 --> 38:44.487
Look he came in
here earlier okay.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.788
I haven't seen him in forever.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.857
Tryna to shake my
hand and make peace.

38:47.859 --> 38:50.727
I didn't want to do
it and I thought,

38:50.729 --> 38:52.962
why don't we just make
some money off of him?

38:52.964 --> 38:54.531
And then I gave him
an edible for free

38:54.533 --> 38:55.798
'cause I'm a nice guy.

38:55.800 --> 38:59.302
Yeah, and he shoved
ex-lax in the edible.

38:59.304 --> 39:00.570
What the...

39:00.572 --> 39:01.404
No!

39:01.406 --> 39:02.906
Yeah, fuck him man.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.541
Remember one time he
sprayed us with mace?

39:04.543 --> 39:06.075
Yeah.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.011
No man, he came in here
and made a truce with you.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.312
You shook his hand.

39:09.314 --> 39:11.915
You took $50, you're
going to hell, man.

39:11.917 --> 39:16.352
And then I changed my mind,
I said fuck him, whatever.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.287
Oh, wow.

39:17.289 --> 39:18.354
Where's the Blueberry?

39:18.356 --> 39:19.756
It's right here.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.591
Cool, let
me get a Bumble sack

39:21.593 --> 39:23.459

39:23.461 --> 39:26.996
All right, that's
back there so, be back.

39:26.998 --> 39:29.132
You might get a
discount, we'll see.

39:29.134 --> 39:30.600
So where's your cousin?

39:30.602 --> 39:31.834

39:31.836 --> 39:34.203
Probably deep in
some pussy by now.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.307
That dude is always
fucking anybody, anything.

39:37.309 --> 39:38.207
Nasty.

39:40.612 --> 39:43.246
You've been a bad boy.

Not what you were expecting?

41:01.593 --> 41:03.192
Fuck no.

41:03.194 --> 41:06.863
Relax, I was
born with both of them

41:06.865 --> 41:09.699
but I identify
myself as a woman.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.771
You like these, don't you?

41:15.707 --> 41:17.006

44:23.428 --> 44:25.428
What about the telly?

You're gonna call them?

44:28.032 --> 44:29.866
No, Tommy Boy's
gonna call them,

44:29.868 --> 44:32.802
they might recognize our voices.

44:32.804 --> 44:35.004
Hey Google, what's
number for Bombalicious?

44:35.006 --> 44:39.976
Bombalicious can

munch" sign is genius bro.

44:58.062 --> 44:59.195

Whenever we need
take a smoke break

45:02.133 --> 45:04.267
we just put that sign out there.

45:04.269 --> 45:06.402
Let's get to the point.

45:06.404 --> 45:09.372
This new job the old

Yeah.

45:14.545 --> 45:15.745
Wait.

45:15.747 --> 45:18.047
You two bastards think
I can't get a job?

45:18.049 --> 45:19.548
It's not that you

45:19.550 --> 45:21.150
you keep getting jobs
but you just keep

45:21.152 --> 45:22.485
getting fired from all jobs.

45:23.721 --> 45:27.023
Man you confusing
me with my cousin bro.

45:27.025 --> 45:28.724
Okay, wait a minute,
what about that job

45:28.726 --> 45:30.359
you had at Rasputins?

45:30.361 --> 45:32.261
Got caught stealing CDs.

45:32.263 --> 45:34.697
I didn't steal
shit, I told you guys.

45:34.699 --> 45:37.300
Look the Darkroom Familia
guys were over there

45:37.302 --> 45:39.268
signing the autographs and shit.

45:39.270 --> 45:42.071
Dude gave me an autographed CD.

45:42.073 --> 45:45.274
Fucking manager guy
stole that shit.

45:45.276 --> 45:47.610
What about the time
that you somehow got a job

45:47.612 --> 45:50.846
at a daycare and
some kid almost died?

45:53.251 --> 45:56.319
What fucking kid
doesn't like PB&J?

45:56.321 --> 45:57.720
How the fuck would
I know the little

45:57.722 --> 46:00.256
bitch had a peanut allergy?

46:00.258 --> 46:03.392
She had a medical
bracelet on, man.

46:04.529 --> 46:05.728
Thought it was jewelry.

46:06.931 --> 46:08.197
It was one of those
EPI pen thingies.

46:08.199 --> 46:09.498
And then he still
couldn't do shit.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.467
Some kid from the
class had to save her

46:11.469 --> 46:12.802
and give her a shot.

46:15.039 --> 46:16.305
I'm afraid of needles.

46:16.307 --> 46:17.840
Look, I don't care.

46:17.842 --> 46:19.375
What do you do there?

46:19.377 --> 46:20.876
All right.

46:20.878 --> 46:25.181
I don't want you guys giving
me any shit for it either.

46:25.183 --> 46:28.517
I'm in charge of
retrieving and washing

46:29.354 --> 46:31.253
the soiled beddings.

46:31.255 --> 46:32.888
That's it.

46:34.592 --> 46:36.759
So you're saying we don't
have to give you shit anymore

46:36.761 --> 46:38.461
'cause you keep getting
it from these seniors.

46:41.065 --> 46:43.532
But I'm getting 30
bucks an hour for that shit.

46:43.534 --> 46:45.801
Okay, whatever that
you getting from that,

46:45.803 --> 46:47.036
but let me ask you a question.

46:47.038 --> 46:50.106
What's the worst shit
you've seen of all?

46:50.108 --> 46:51.273
Do I want to hear this?

46:51.275 --> 46:52.108
I don't know if I do.

46:53.611 --> 46:55.011
That's easy.

46:55.013 --> 46:57.413
Last week, this 90
nine year old lady

46:57.415 --> 46:59.148
shat herself everywhere.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.517
So they called me to go
retrieve her beddings

47:01.519 --> 47:03.386
and so when I get there,
the nurse already pulled

47:03.388 --> 47:05.154
her to the side and
was holding her,

47:05.156 --> 47:06.889
she'd just took off her diaper.

47:06.891 --> 47:09.125
So all you can see is
this dripping, sagging,

47:09.127 --> 47:12.361
wrinkled, white ass
smothered in shit.

47:14.298 --> 47:18.167
As I was pulling her shit-wet
sheets from underneath her,

47:18.169 --> 47:21.170
the fucking crow
goes at it and again.

47:21.172 --> 47:23.706
Look like fucking purple prune
juice coming out of there.

47:23.708 --> 47:25.841
So I panicked and I just
bunched up the sheets

47:25.843 --> 47:28.177
to try to shut her asshole,

47:29.247 --> 47:30.312
but that shit didn't work.

47:30.314 --> 47:31.580
It just came out

47:31.582 --> 47:33.983
the side and top of the sheet.

47:33.985 --> 47:36.085
Please tell me
that you had gloves

47:37.155 --> 47:38.654
The little latex thing?

47:38.656 --> 47:39.488
Anything?

47:39.490 --> 47:40.689
Something?

47:40.691 --> 47:42.992
It goes up to my
elbows and that shit.

47:44.295 --> 47:45.428
Its disgusting dude.

47:45.430 --> 47:46.662
Fucking nasty.

47:46.664 --> 47:48.264
Yeah but I got
overtime for that.

47:49.467 --> 47:52.268
Man I don't think that
$3000 is worth that.

47:52.270 --> 47:54.437
Ain't the
only time it happened.

47:54.439 --> 47:56.872
You know somethin' man, you
messed me up so bad right now.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.107
I think I'm constipating again.

47:58.109 --> 47:59.442
My crap just called up my ass.

47:59.444 --> 48:00.709
The phone's ringing, c'mon.

48:02.413 --> 48:03.245
Bombalicious.

48:03.247 --> 48:04.113
Mind, body and soul.

48:04.115 --> 48:04.980
Soul!

48:06.284 --> 48:07.216
Hello.

48:07.218 --> 48:08.317
Hey, how's it going brother?

48:08.319 --> 48:09.552
My name is Rocky Robbins.

48:09.554 --> 48:11.654
I'm a reporter from
"High Times" Magazine.

48:11.656 --> 48:13.722
Is the owner available?

48:13.724 --> 48:16.192
Hey man, It's a reporter's

48:16.194 --> 48:17.026

48:17.862 --> 48:19.395
I'm Jim with two Ms.

48:19.397 --> 48:22.932
Well, Jimmy, I want to do
an exclusive on the shop.

48:22.934 --> 48:26.102
If the editor likes what he
sees, maybe even a cover story.

48:26.104 --> 48:29.605
I understand you're very
popular in the Bay Area.

48:29.607 --> 48:31.974
Oh, that's right,
we Oaktown's finest.

48:31.976 --> 48:33.209
Its what I hear.

48:33.211 --> 48:34.743
Would it be possible
to do an interview

48:34.745 --> 48:38.147
with your partners
sometime tomorrow?

48:38.149 --> 48:39.615
Yeah,

48:39.617 --> 48:42.852
they wanna interview
me and my partners.

48:42.854 --> 48:44.186
Yeah, but it's just us though.

48:44.188 --> 48:46.122
Barney is not even here.

48:46.124 --> 48:48.757
Hey, look well, tomorrow's
fine, but just it's gonna be

48:48.759 --> 48:50.426
you know, it's
only me and Oscar.

48:50.428 --> 48:52.128
Barney is not here.

48:52.130 --> 48:54.630
Oh, is that Mr. Bumble?

48:54.632 --> 48:55.865
Yeah, yeah.

48:55.867 --> 48:56.999
He's at a seminary
school somewhere

48:57.001 --> 48:58.601
in Sacramento, you know.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.536
I understand.

49:00.538 --> 49:02.938
And that will be fine
if it's just two.

49:02.940 --> 49:05.541
I'm sure you can fill me
in and about Mr. Bumble.

49:05.543 --> 49:06.909
Oh yeah.

49:06.911 --> 49:09.678
Oh, I'd like to take
some pictures as well.

49:09.680 --> 49:11.413
That'd be fine.

49:11.415 --> 49:14.116
Okay, sir try for 12.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.317
I'll phone you when I get in,

49:15.319 --> 49:16.819
if that's all right, yeah?

49:16.821 --> 49:17.653
Yeah man.

49:17.655 --> 49:18.487
That's good.

49:18.489 --> 49:19.355
That's good.

49:19.357 --> 49:20.389
Thank you.

49:20.391 --> 49:21.891
Oh, no sir.

49:21.893 --> 49:23.259
Thank you.

49:23.261 --> 49:24.860
Huh?

49:26.097 --> 49:27.830
How did I do?

49:27.832 --> 49:30.799
Brilliant my man, brilliant.

49:30.801 --> 49:32.301
Oh I have a plan.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.336
But first we must drive
to Sacramento to make sure

49:34.338 --> 49:38.240
our green umbrella fella
is becoming a priest.

49:43.948 --> 49:45.814
Hey, welcome to Bombalicious.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.183
Come on in, man.

49:47.185 --> 49:48.384

49:48.386 --> 49:50.119

49:52.557 --> 49:54.790
Don't ask me I can't sign?

49:55.993 --> 49:57.326
Oh shit.

49:57.328 --> 49:59.028
Don't worry guys,
I got this guys.

49:59.030 --> 50:01.497
I knew a mute in high school.

50:06.871 --> 50:09.171
Sorry, we're out of weed.

50:10.341 --> 50:12.341
How can I help you bro?

50:13.344 --> 50:15.344
Thank you, brother.

50:15.346 --> 50:16.979
Glad you know sign.

50:18.382 --> 50:20.950
I want bumble sack of cookies.

50:27.158 --> 50:30.226
He wants a bumble
sack of cookies.

50:31.762 --> 50:32.595
What are you waiting for?

50:32.597 --> 50:33.429
Get him some weed man.

50:33.431 --> 50:35.798
Okay, okay.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.701
Hey, tell him

50:38.703 --> 50:41.537

sorry for the wait.

50:42.807 --> 50:46.175
It's on the house,
sorry for the wait.

50:49.213 --> 50:50.179
Thank you.

51:05.029 --> 51:06.562
What the fuck
did I just watch?

51:06.564 --> 51:07.997
Why are you talking like that?

51:07.999 --> 51:10.266
Hey man, what's up
with you with that guy?

51:10.268 --> 51:11.367
What did I do?

51:11.369 --> 51:12.801
I just signed with the guy.

51:12.803 --> 51:14.803
No man, you was sounding
like Marlee Matlin.

51:14.805 --> 51:17.039
I don't know and who
the fuck is Marlee Matlin?

51:17.041 --> 51:19.942
It's the deaf actress who
signs and talks like that.

51:19.944 --> 51:21.443
What the fuck are
you talking about?

51:21.445 --> 51:23.145
That's how all the mutes talk.

51:23.147 --> 51:25.681
It's not mute
asshole, it's deaf.

51:25.683 --> 51:26.582
All right deaf.

51:26.584 --> 51:27.816
What the fuck dude.

51:27.818 --> 51:30.252
I helped you guys out
and you guys talk shit?

51:30.254 --> 51:32.488
It took everything I had not
to crack up before that guy.

51:33.858 --> 51:35.391
Yeah, me too man.

51:35.393 --> 51:36.392
Yeah man it sound like you were

51:36.394 --> 51:38.460
making fun of that guy.

51:38.462 --> 51:41.163
Well, I can't help it.

51:41.165 --> 51:43.799
I met some guy in high
school and I can't help

51:43.801 --> 51:46.602
it if I talk like that
when I sign language.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.271
That's how I talk, when I sign.

51:54.011 --> 51:55.644
You're a dick.

51:57.748 --> 51:59.615
That's some fucking shit.

51:59.617 --> 52:02.651
Yeah, it's some
real fucked up shit.

52:02.653 --> 52:05.487
You're such a dip shit bro.

52:05.489 --> 52:07.389
Get your ass off me.

52:10.895 --> 52:12.361
Hey guys, about
one block away.

52:12.363 --> 52:14.563
I told you we'd be
here before six.

52:14.565 --> 52:17.566
This baby's accurate to
the minute and miles.

52:17.568 --> 52:20.269
Technology today is
absolutely amazing.

52:20.271 --> 52:24.506
We didn't even have the
I-cellphone when I got locked up.

52:24.508 --> 52:27.743
It's iPhone bro, just iPhone.

52:27.745 --> 52:29.211
Whatever, dude.

52:36.053 --> 52:37.219
There it is guys.

52:37.221 --> 52:38.887
All Saints Seminar.

52:43.461 --> 52:44.793
How are you gonna
find him, Larry?

52:44.795 --> 52:46.962
Are you just gonna
walk in and ask?

52:46.964 --> 52:48.397
No, Evans.

52:48.399 --> 52:51.367
I had Tommy Boy here call
while he was scrubbing your ass

52:51.369 --> 52:53.001
and inquire about Bumble.

52:53.003 --> 52:56.372
Yeah, apparently
he's going in some

52:56.374 --> 52:59.641
Narcotics Anonymous class
every weeknight at six.

52:59.643 --> 53:02.077
Poor bastard's having
trouble kicking the weed.

53:02.079 --> 53:03.579
Yet he still owns a pot shop.

53:03.581 --> 53:04.947
the irony.

53:04.949 --> 53:07.182
Yeah, well
business is business.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.817
That is correct.

53:08.819 --> 53:11.120
So if Tommy got the
word from the street,

53:11.122 --> 53:14.289
his own partners tell you,
why do you still insist

53:14.291 --> 53:16.892
on seeing this
prick as a priest?

53:16.894 --> 53:19.395
I have to see things
with my own eyes.

53:19.397 --> 53:21.597
Even though I despise
Bubble and his crew.

53:21.599 --> 53:23.966
I must respect the
man's higher calling.

53:23.968 --> 53:25.834
With all the sinning
I've done in my life,

53:25.836 --> 53:28.270
I hope the Lord has a
small place for me through

53:28.272 --> 53:30.172
those pearly gates
and I can't ruin that

53:30.174 --> 53:32.141
by killing a man of God.

53:32.143 --> 53:33.675
Damn bro.

53:33.677 --> 53:35.210
That's some deep shit!

53:35.212 --> 53:37.913
Maybe you wanna turn
over a new leaf?

53:37.915 --> 53:39.648
Don't get it,
what do they say,

53:39.650 --> 53:41.283
twisted, Tommy Boy.

53:42.119 --> 53:44.186
I may not hurt him physically.

53:44.188 --> 53:46.255
But if I can hurt
him financially,

53:46.257 --> 53:49.658
then I'll have it
all, will have it all.

53:50.428 --> 53:52.728
Well its 10 to six.

53:52.730 --> 53:55.030
Look there's someone now.

53:57.868 --> 54:00.035
No, it can't be, is it?

54:04.275 --> 54:07.409
If hadn't seen it
with my own peepers.

54:09.380 --> 54:11.580
Well, we still have
his asshole friends.

54:11.582 --> 54:13.282
That's where I
wanna get back at.

54:13.284 --> 54:17.586
Yeah, I'm afraid Bumble
gets a pass for now.

54:17.588 --> 54:20.989
But those friends,
those wankers do not.

54:26.163 --> 54:27.729
I know what that face means,

54:27.731 --> 54:29.731
you have a plan right?

54:29.733 --> 54:30.966
If you want to hurt someone,

54:30.968 --> 54:33.335
you hurt them where
it hurts the hardest.

54:33.337 --> 54:34.703
And where does it
hurt the hardest?

54:34.705 --> 54:35.971
In their wallet.

54:35.973 --> 54:39.208
So tomorrow we shall
have our payback!

54:40.211 --> 54:42.177
What do you wanna do now?

54:42.179 --> 54:44.279
We need some supplies.

54:44.281 --> 54:45.747
What kind of supplies?

54:45.749 --> 54:48.250
Surplus, tactical, costume.

54:49.487 --> 54:50.919
Do you know any?

54:50.921 --> 54:52.454
I know of one.

54:52.456 --> 54:54.723
There's one in Marina, one
in Berkeley or some shit,

54:54.725 --> 54:56.191
Party Haven?

54:56.193 --> 54:57.426
Excellent.

54:57.428 --> 54:58.560
Off you go, my good man.

54:58.562 --> 54:59.862
Now, listen up.

55:12.109 --> 55:14.743
Hey bro, hang this up for us.

55:16.146 --> 55:17.880
Its barely six o'clock,
you guys closing already?

55:17.882 --> 55:20.449
Yeah, we always
close this time man.

55:20.451 --> 55:21.817
Why?

55:21.819 --> 55:24.386
Because the freaks definitely
do come out at night.

55:24.388 --> 55:25.587
Yeah man, all them types

55:25.589 --> 55:27.322
and bad apples they
come on at night

55:27.324 --> 55:30.058
man so we closed
right at sunset.

55:30.060 --> 55:32.160
You guys don't lose
business that way?

55:32.162 --> 55:33.662
I don't think so.

55:33.664 --> 55:35.564
We open up shop at seven a.m.
for the wake and bake crowd

55:35.566 --> 55:37.799
and by four o'clock everyone
already has their weed

55:37.801 --> 55:41.904
because they wanna
smoke on 4:20, yada?

55:41.906 --> 55:43.338
Makes sense.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.340
Besides man, most
robberies happen at night

55:45.342 --> 55:47.876
and I sure in the hell
don't wanna get robbed

55:47.878 --> 55:50.712
by no ratchet ass
Oaktown niggas at night.

55:50.714 --> 55:52.247
True.

55:52.249 --> 55:53.682
Are you coming
with us or what?

55:53.684 --> 55:56.552
No, man that was Mario.

55:56.554 --> 55:57.953
He needs a ride.

55:59.423 --> 56:01.156
Are you tellin' me that
nigga still aint got no car

56:01.158 --> 56:02.758
or nothing like that?

56:02.760 --> 56:03.725
Nah bro.

56:03.727 --> 56:06.028
He barely makes rent as it is.

56:06.030 --> 56:08.130
so he don't have any
kind of job at all.

56:08.132 --> 56:09.331
Nah bro.

56:09.333 --> 56:11.233
Not after that a
crop dusting thing.

56:11.235 --> 56:12.868
He says his job is pimping hoes

56:12.870 --> 56:14.670
and using bitches like ATM.

56:14.672 --> 56:16.405
Man, he don't want him
getting the clap or the herps

56:16.407 --> 56:17.673
or something like that.

56:17.675 --> 56:19.341
He got
the clamps last year

56:19.343 --> 56:20.809
after fucking with some bitch.

56:20.811 --> 56:23.946
And then check this out after
using all the antibiotics,

56:23.948 --> 56:26.448
you know, to cure
his little thing,

56:26.450 --> 56:29.184
he went right back to this
bitch because she worked

56:29.186 --> 56:31.620
at Krispy Kreme's and
always bought him donuts.

56:31.622 --> 56:32.688
Dude, that's
fucking disgusting.

56:32.690 --> 56:35.090
What the fuck are the clams?

56:36.460 --> 56:37.893
Chlamydia, bro.

56:37.895 --> 56:40.562
He had, green goo dripping
out of his pee pee.

56:40.564 --> 56:41.697
Okay, that's enough.

56:41.699 --> 56:42.898
I've had enough.

56:42.900 --> 56:44.232
You've been say some
nasty shit all day, bro.

56:44.234 --> 56:45.200
A lot of nasty shit bro.

56:45.202 --> 56:46.835
Just hang the sign and leave.

56:46.837 --> 56:48.337
Yeah, really gone bro.

56:49.573 --> 56:50.973
Hey, just
hang the sign and go.

56:50.975 --> 56:52.140
Yeah, got go.

56:52.142 --> 56:53.175
All right, guys.

56:53.177 --> 56:54.676
Catch up with you guys later.

56:54.678 --> 56:55.544
All right.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.479
That's your friend.

56:57.481 --> 56:58.880
No man, that's
your friend man.

56:58.882 --> 56:59.681
Its your fucking
friend, you're the one who

56:59.683 --> 57:00.616
introduced me to him

57:00.618 --> 57:01.550
When?

57:01.552 --> 57:03.051
You slept with his sister.

57:03.053 --> 57:05.520
I didn't know him then,
you slept with his Mom.

57:05.522 --> 57:06.622
Yeah then I
gotta be his friend.

57:06.624 --> 57:08.090
You gotta be as fuck.

57:08.092 --> 57:09.858
Look you have to be his
friend or I can't be yours.

57:09.860 --> 57:11.393
That's true, fuck!

57:24.642 --> 57:26.475
Did I wear you out?

57:29.246 --> 57:30.779
I think you broke my dick.

57:32.483 --> 57:33.715
Is that all?

57:35.352 --> 57:36.385
My back too.

57:42.960 --> 57:43.859
Damn.

57:44.828 --> 57:45.661
Can you get that for me?

57:46.930 --> 57:48.664
It's on your side.

57:51.402 --> 57:52.300
Okay,

57:53.203 --> 57:54.603
one, two, three.

58:01.712 --> 58:03.378
Stop it.

58:03.380 --> 58:06.448
Mario, I've seen
all of you today.

58:07.351 --> 58:08.750
Inside, outside,

58:12.589 --> 58:13.555
everywhere.

58:14.525 --> 58:15.791
Shh!

58:15.793 --> 58:17.025
Its my cousin.

58:18.929 --> 58:20.629
Whats up cuz?

58:20.631 --> 58:23.098
What up boy, you ready?

58:23.100 --> 58:25.500

58:25.502 --> 58:27.736
Let me just put my
shirt on real quick.

58:27.738 --> 58:30.005
All right, man but hurry up.

58:30.007 --> 58:32.541
I wanna get home before
"The Bachelor" starts.

58:32.543 --> 58:34.509
It's the season finale.

58:35.546 --> 58:38.180
Just give me
like, five minutes.

58:39.516 --> 58:41.583
Damn boy, you're all right?

58:41.585 --> 58:43.952
Sound beat up or something.

58:43.954 --> 58:46.955
Yeah, cuddy,
I'll be right out.

58:46.957 --> 58:47.856

59:35.739 --> 59:38.540
I don't know,
I don't see them.

59:38.542 --> 59:40.842
Maybe you're lying on them.

59:44.014 --> 59:45.847
Nah they're not right there.

59:48.085 --> 59:49.017
Oh shit!

59:49.019 --> 59:51.019
I think they're up my feet.

59:51.021 --> 59:52.387
And?

59:52.389 --> 59:53.522
Babe!

59:53.524 --> 59:55.390
Don't do me like that.

59:55.392 --> 59:56.391
Get them for me?

59:56.393 --> 59:57.626
You gotta be kidding me.

59:57.628 --> 59:59.795
You're acting like an old man.

01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.932
I feel
like an old man.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.735
And hurry up.

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:08.270
"The Bachelor" is coming
on and I don't wanna

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:09.838
miss the last one.

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:16.077
Being a bachelor isn't
all it's cracked up to be.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.029
Back to my self.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:36.565
I'm back.

01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:41.837
What a bloody, long day!

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.271
Tell me about it.

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:44.906
This morning we were
eating grits and runny eggs

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:47.242
with assholes in
orange jumpsuits.

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:49.744
And now we're
planning a robbery?

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:52.948
It's funny how
life works, isn't it?

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:55.550
Please tell me we're not
gonna end up back in orange.

01:00:55.552 --> 01:00:58.153
Got a point, you
sure about this, Larry?

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:01.890
I'm willing to bet my freedom
on it's a brilliant plan.

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:04.426
First we pull up in the sedan,

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:07.596
lights flashing.

01:01:07.598 --> 01:01:11.132
Three federal agents step
out, one, two, three,

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.368
fully covered in FBI gear.

01:01:14.938 --> 01:01:17.539
We hank up those
bastards to the floor.

01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:18.740
When they're unable to move,

01:01:18.742 --> 01:01:21.376
we'll rob them of every
ounce of Mary Jane.

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:24.246
Disappear without an issue,
and vanish without a trace.

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.248
And we'll have enough
merchandise to start

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:27.315
our own operation.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:29.618
All on those wankers' dime.

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:31.987
But weed's legal
in California now,

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:33.822
why would they think
it's a real raid?

01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:36.391
That's true its
legal in California,

01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:38.860
but according to the federal
government, it's illegal.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:41.029
They serve federal
seizures all the time,

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:45.533
for tax issues or the
selling of illegal narcotics.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.335
That's why it's a
federal seizure.

01:01:47.337 --> 01:01:51.506
With the FBI serving it,
it makes it legit, right?

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:53.041
You're right.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.143
But how much stuff do you
think we can leave with?

01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:56.444
All of it?

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:58.580
They must have over
80 to $100,000 worth

01:01:58.582 --> 01:02:00.882
of sweet Mary Jane.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.717
Yeah, I could believe that.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.220
It's reasonable,
maybe even more.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.489
I heard all they
have is quality shit.

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:09.157
I like the sound of that.

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:11.159
I also like the tactical gear.

01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:12.794
Right in our faces.

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:14.262
Good plan.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:15.730
It's fool proof.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.165
I hope you're right, brother.

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:18.967
I hope you're right.

01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:23.138
Hold on, don't look at these.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.482
Poppins, you are without
a doubt a pure genius.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.254
You're gonna have to work
on your American accent.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:41.456
Oh, you don't have to
worry about that, buddy.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:46.027
I watched enough American
television to get that done.

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:47.562
Freeze motherfucker!

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:49.698
Excellent.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.267
Legit man, straight legit.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.337
Love it, love it.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:21.863
About time.

01:03:21.865 --> 01:03:22.697
20 minutes.

01:03:22.699 --> 01:03:24.599
What happened to five?

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.304
I'm sorry, cuz.

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:33.208
Don't serve with that
fucking shotgun cuddy.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.877
Shit, It got dark,
this is Oakland.

01:03:35.879 --> 01:03:38.279
Bro you know I'm on probation.

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.581
Put that chopper
on the trunk before

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:42.517
we get pulled over or somethin'.

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.252
All right but when I get back

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:48.123
you gonna tell me what
happened, all right?

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:49.691
Go bro, just go.

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.497
I aint going nowhere until
you tell me what happened.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:57.232
Fuck "The Bachelor".

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:21.589
So what happened?

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:23.992
Look bro, I'm sorry
it took so long okay?

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:26.461
Nah man, that's
not what I mean bro.

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:29.364
What happened with
the chick, bro?

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:31.599
She aint like you

01:04:32.803 --> 01:04:35.637
You look like you were
in the battle royal boy.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:37.105
I feel like I was too, cuddy.

01:04:37.107 --> 01:04:38.006
For real.

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:41.176
The fuck, what happened?

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.213
Did you hit it or not?

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.714
Did you?

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:47.615
Yeah.

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:50.919
Was it good?

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:53.855
Everything you expected?

01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:55.323
Was it bomb bro?

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:56.591
Tell me the truth.

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:59.661
I don't know, I
haven't decided yet.

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:02.397
What the fuck does that mean?

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:05.166
The girl clearly worked you out.

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:07.335
Its complicated.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:08.970
Complicated?

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:11.739
Bro, this morning
you were all excited.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:14.175
You were finally going
to get some pussy.

01:05:14.177 --> 01:05:15.410
What happened?

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:21.683
I've never seen anybody
so upset they got laid.

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:27.722
She had a dick or somethin'?

01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:32.660
She had a dick?

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:34.429
Just go bro.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.297
"The Bachelor" is on, fuck.

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:37.432
All right dude.

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:40.969
She had a dick.

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:43.505
Yeah.

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:52.947
Lets go.

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:58.019
We're late.

01:06:01.224 --> 01:06:02.123
Come on!

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:08.363
What are you doing?

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:10.431
Give me a minute, bro.

01:06:12.903 --> 01:06:14.502
What were you
doing in there, man?

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:16.838
Man, I told you

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.018
It's a trip right?

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.619

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:32.854

But hey, you wanna

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:47.335

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.346
and give you all the
protein you need.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:00.548
That's what you want
in your body right now.

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.450
No man, this shit

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:03.451
It tastes good.

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:04.953
Just eat it and you'll be fine.

01:07:04.955 --> 01:07:06.621

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.766
Man that's Turtle.

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:54.302
You know what you

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:57.672
Man, what the
fuck is he doing here?

01:07:57.674 --> 01:07:58.940
Hey, I don't know,
but if I were you

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:01.976
I wouldn't get out
of no fucking car.

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:05.280
What's up?

01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:06.447

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:08.816

Get out the car li'l bitch.

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:16.791
Don't get the

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:17.792
I'm telling you man.

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:19.661
Fuck is your problem, Turtle?

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:22.563
This is shit six, seven

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:24.098
Oh shit.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.433
That's for the
ex-lax brownie, shitface.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:28.703
Not a fucking word.

01:08:28.705 --> 01:08:29.569
Don't say shit.

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:31.072
No man, I'm not.

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.307
But I know one thing, you
need to brush your teeth

01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:34.008
'cause they really
do smell like shit.

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.876
Fuck hard!

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.578
Fuck!

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.823
Hey Mario, are you up?

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.330

interview, you want to come?

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:09.277
No!

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:12.346
All right.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:17.819
Well, I left you some chorizo

01:09:23.193 --> 01:09:25.359

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.109
You know the rule.

01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:44.178
Don't ever let
anybody get you down.

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.388
Man!

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:56.824

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:02.130
and now you're using
up Lysol wipes.

01:10:02.132 --> 01:10:03.664
Man you clean, bro.

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.800
I swear to god, as soon
as that interview is over,

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:07.235

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:08.636
and you're gonna
help me, we're gonna

01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:10.638
hunt that motherfucker down.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.906
Who we hunting down?

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:12.740

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:14.275
Okay, all right bro.

01:10:14.277 --> 01:10:15.443
Like turtle, you know what

01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:16.644
I know who you

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:19.647
Relax bro, it's all right.

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:21.549
Why would we hunt

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.118
I can still smell it!

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:24.986
Fuck!

01:10:24.988 --> 01:10:25.887
Man.

01:10:28.525 --> 01:10:29.690
Come on man, I'm just
messing with you bro.

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:31.225
We gotta get cleaned up, man.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.294
100% nice and clean because
we got "High Times" Magazine

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:34.529

pictures at 12.

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:36.330
We got to get
cleaned up, come on.

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:37.465
What time did they say
that they're gonna come.

01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:38.666
It's almost noon.

01:10:38.668 --> 01:10:40.067
Yeah they said it'd
be about 12, man.

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.269
But you know they've
gotta come in at airport

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:42.503
and shit like that, bro.

01:10:42.505 --> 01:10:43.771
All right, you know,
it just take time

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.239
for them to get
here, that's all,

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.641
You know.

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:48.976
Hey, did you clean
your nose out?

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.311
Yes, I cleaned my
fucking nose out.

01:10:50.313 --> 01:10:51.646
Okay?

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:52.914
I put the water hose
up my fucking nose.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.482
I had water coming
out of my eyeballs.

01:10:54.484 --> 01:10:56.384
Did shit come out
of your eyeballs?

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.486
I'm just playing, man.

01:10:58.488 --> 01:11:00.021
Stop getting so crazy, bro.

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:01.422
All right.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:02.824
Damn dude, and you know

01:11:02.826 --> 01:11:05.827

lemon shit too now.

01:11:05.829 --> 01:11:06.694
Ow, man.

01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:10.331
Karma is a bitch, huh?

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:11.899
Shut up.

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:29.283
Bombalicious, products
for the mind, body and soul.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.785
Soul!

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.086
What it to do, man?

01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:33.955
Hey, what's up, Arnie?

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:35.890
I'm like
one minute away, bro.

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:38.025
Any word on the interview?

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:38.860
The interview?

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:39.861
I don't know.

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:41.329
You gotta ask Jimmy.

01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:46.067
According to him, it's gonna
happen sometime this afternoon.

01:12:08.024 --> 01:12:09.390
Actually hold on for a second.

01:12:09.392 --> 01:12:10.324
All right.

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:11.792
Put the "out to munch" sign

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:13.661
so that the customers don't
interrupt the interview.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:14.729
All right.

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:17.398
So what were you saying?

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.966
Yeah, what's up.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:21.569
Oh shit, its the Feds!

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:22.403
Hey man!

01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:23.237
What the fuck?

01:12:23.239 --> 01:12:24.171
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.339
Freeze motherfuckers!

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:26.107
Is Anybody
else in here?

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:27.041
No man, no!

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:27.875
My hands are up, don't shoot.

01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:30.044
Oh my god!

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:31.145
Its anybody

01:12:31.147 --> 01:12:32.413
No man!

01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:33.915
Hey bro

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:36.484
I'm pulling up right now.

01:12:36.486 --> 01:12:39.520
Leave the phone
on so I can hear.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:41.055
This is
a federal warrant.

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:42.823
We're seizing your shop
for us narcotics violation

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.625
of the US Penal Code.

01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:45.793
Don't move
a fucking finger

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:47.662
or I'll put one
through your fat head.

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:48.863
This is bullshit man.

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.131
Marijuana is legal
in California.

01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:51.632
Last time I checked,

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:54.068
California is part of the
United States and narcotics

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:55.836
are illegal in the US.

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.104

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:58.172

01:12:58.174 --> 01:12:59.340

01:13:00.176 --> 01:13:01.008
Get on your knees!

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:01.842
Get on your knees!

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:02.710
Damn.

01:13:04.447 --> 01:13:06.013

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.916
Okay, all

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.019

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:18.025

01:13:23.633 --> 01:13:25.833
The interview's the least
of our problems right now.

01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:27.702
You mean your
interview with a "High Times"

01:13:27.704 --> 01:13:29.804
star reporter Rocky Robins?

01:13:29.806 --> 01:13:31.172

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:32.306
You fucking wanker.

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:33.975
Hi guys.

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:38.946
This aint a raid.

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:40.514
This is a robbery.

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.059
Do you
have an emergency?

01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:52.960
Hello, 911?

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:54.195
Yes.

01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:55.463
There's a robbery

Hurry up!

01:14:01.738 --> 01:14:02.803
They're on their way.

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:04.338
They're dressed like feds.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.339
Got it.

01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:06.374
All right.

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:13.114
This sucks.

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:15.783
Ow, okay, all right, all right.

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:18.653
They just taking
all our weed, man.

01:14:18.655 --> 01:14:20.955
C'mon man this is bullshit.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.160
All right man, damn.

01:14:26.162 --> 01:14:28.295
You're lucky I'm cuffed,

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.997
Yeah, you dumb fucks!

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:32.700
We just wanted to get

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:36.037
Now just stay there,
we're almost done.

01:14:38.374 --> 01:14:39.940
