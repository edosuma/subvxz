[narrator] Previously
in90 Day Fiance
The Other Way.

00:03.206 --> 00:05.689
[Jenny] So, do we have
your blessings to marry?

00:09.551 --> 00:10.689
I understand.

00:11.931 --> 00:14.379
They're not going to stop us
and that's good enough for me.

00:15.310 --> 00:16.689
[chuckling]

00:18.793 --> 00:20.896
[Evelin] Ah, Corey!

00:21.000 --> 00:22.793
Why do you do
these cute things?

00:22.896 --> 00:25.275
Cause I'm
re-proposing to you again.

00:25.379 --> 00:27.275
[Corey] I don't think
Evelin will ever fully

00:27.379 --> 00:30.103
forget the past,
but I'm hoping that

00:30.206 --> 00:32.379
she's ready to move forward
in the relationship.

00:32.482 --> 00:33.517
Yeah, I say yes.

00:33.620 --> 00:34.965
Yeah! [chuckles]

00:47.724 --> 00:48.793
He's in the car.

00:48.896 --> 00:50.034
Yay!

00:50.137 --> 00:51.206
[chuckles]

00:52.827 --> 00:54.034
[tense music playing]

01:00.000 --> 01:01.931
[Steven] The truth is
if it was up to me

01:02.034 --> 01:03.896
and the circumstances
were different,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.379
I would've preferred
to not rush into a marriage.

01:07.482 --> 01:10.103
I am ready. And we can still
make it to Russia together.

01:13.862 --> 01:15.344
I want you to be nice to me.

01:18.586 --> 01:21.517
[Ellie] I would never claim
to know what you went through.

01:21.620 --> 01:26.448
[Victor] It's not
an easy place to start
again from zero.

01:26.551 --> 01:29.379
[Ariela] There was
a lot of people sleeping in
and out of my house.

01:31.241 --> 01:33.896
[Ariela] He doesn't want
to take responsibility
for anything.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
If he doesn't see that
he's done something wrong,
then there's nothing I can do.

01:38.103 --> 01:40.793
[crying] I am very,
very sorry for you.

01:40.896 --> 01:43.034
And the life
that you're gonna have.

01:48.758 --> 01:52.965
[upbeat music playing]

02:08.137 --> 02:09.517
[Jenny] Of all
the visits we've had,

02:09.620 --> 02:11.517
this one right here
is the most important.

02:11.931 --> 02:13.275
[Sumit] Yeah.

02:13.379 --> 02:17.862
I just hope
that the time is favorable
for us to get married.

02:17.965 --> 02:20.413
[Jenny] Yeah, I hope so.
I hope he says, "Yeah,

02:20.517 --> 02:23.103
you guys are good to go
just so go for it."

02:23.206 --> 02:25.241
Since Sumit's parents
said they're not gonna object

02:25.344 --> 02:28.482
to us getting married,
we're gonna go ahead and
move forward with the wedding.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.206
[Sumit] So, I just want
a good life with you

02:32.310 --> 02:34.793
so he can read our chart

02:34.896 --> 02:37.620
and tell us to the best time
to get married.

02:39.655 --> 02:41.586
I just hope that,

02:41.689 --> 02:43.896
like, as we already
waited for long time

02:44.000 --> 02:47.482
to star seeing,
the planets seeing,
and everything changes.

02:52.517 --> 02:54.448
[tense music playing]

03:18.068 --> 03:19.586
Sumit, good to see you.

03:19.689 --> 03:21.758
[Sumit] He said the time
is not good, your...

03:21.862 --> 03:25.000
stars are not
aligned properly.

03:25.103 --> 03:29.068
Maybe still time
is not favor to the marriage.

03:29.172 --> 03:31.862
And that's why we
are going to see him

03:31.965 --> 03:34.344
and find out what's
the best time to get married.

03:35.724 --> 03:38.137
[Khalid] It's a great
achievement to see you happy.

03:38.241 --> 03:39.793
Yeah, you can see it
in our faces.

03:39.896 --> 03:41.241
Yeah, true.

03:41.344 --> 03:44.068
-[Jenny] Yeah.
-So, how was it later
once I left ?

03:44.172 --> 03:45.931
They had such
a big turnaround, I mean,

03:46.034 --> 03:49.551
all thanks to you they're
not gonna fight us anymore.

03:49.655 --> 03:51.275
They know we wanna marry.

03:51.379 --> 03:54.103
His mom seems to still be
having a problem with that,

03:54.206 --> 03:57.344
um, but his father said,
"We are not going
to stop you."

03:57.448 --> 03:59.655
That's really good,
really good news.

04:00.689 --> 04:02.551
So, what are
the next new plans?

04:02.655 --> 04:07.517
[Jenny] Well,
we are here just to find out
if it's okay for us to marry.

04:07.620 --> 04:08.620
The next chapter.

04:08.724 --> 04:10.172
[Jenny] Yes.

04:10.275 --> 04:12.000
[Khalid] Well, last time,
when I told you to wait

04:12.103 --> 04:14.413
-it was because the stars
were quite negative.
-[Sumit] Yeah.

04:15.241 --> 04:16.103
[Khalid] Let's see.

04:17.068 --> 04:19.068
What all stars have
in store for you?

04:20.793 --> 04:23.241
This is the lunar
system of astrology.

04:23.344 --> 04:25.379
Basically,
what happens is we have

04:25.482 --> 04:28.655
seasonal changes because
of the earth's rotation.

04:28.758 --> 04:31.000
[tense music playing]

04:31.103 --> 04:35.482
Since many, many years there
have been lot of hurdles,
what have they been doing?

04:36.482 --> 04:38.241
But the moon
is changing rapidly.

04:42.068 --> 04:44.206
Yeah, 22nd Jan., 1988.

04:47.241 --> 04:48.620
[Jenny] Yeah.

05:16.068 --> 05:18.931
[laughs]

05:19.034 --> 05:22.206
I feel so much relieved.
Like, I... I don't know.

05:22.310 --> 05:23.448
This is amazing.

05:23.551 --> 05:25.310
Yes, this is amazing.

05:30.344 --> 05:32.551
And you may
get married after a month,

05:32.655 --> 05:34.310
two months,
that doesn't make difference.

05:38.586 --> 05:40.482
[Jenny] Okay, so,
that's means the 10th then.

05:40.586 --> 05:44.448
[Sumit] Yeah. If it's...
if it's... if it's possible.

05:44.551 --> 05:46.275
And you have to be
specifically clear

05:46.379 --> 05:49.551
about this, that we're not
doing the temple thing here.

05:49.655 --> 05:53.379
The stars do not allow him
to have a ceremonial wedding.

05:53.482 --> 05:56.827
So, if you will have a formal
marriage, that won't last.

06:10.896 --> 06:13.689
Basically,
keeping it to you two only.

06:14.655 --> 06:16.448
We don't want him
to have another divorce.

06:17.758 --> 06:19.689
God willing,
everything will go good.

06:19.793 --> 06:20.793
Okay.

06:20.896 --> 06:22.103
[tense music playing]

06:22.206 --> 06:23.103
[Sumit] Oh, my God.

06:37.448 --> 06:39.275
I'm just so happy
for you tell us

06:39.379 --> 06:42.137
that it is okay
for us to marry,
this is what we've wanted,

06:42.241 --> 06:45.000
-but I've been
wanting to hear, of course.
-Yeah.

06:45.103 --> 06:48.586
It's all God plan.
We call it God's master plan.

06:51.103 --> 06:55.241
[instrumental music playing]

07:05.931 --> 07:08.000
-Why do you let cars pass you?
-I...

07:08.103 --> 07:09.448
Cause I don't wanna crash it.

07:09.551 --> 07:11.517
It's a van,
they don't go fast.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.793
[Corey] I'm
really excited to do this.

07:15.896 --> 07:18.448
I'm excited to see
what you've planned for this.

07:18.551 --> 07:20.448
[Corey] Since Eve and I
agreed a few weeks to move

07:20.551 --> 07:22.620
forward with the wedding,
we picked the wedding date,

07:22.724 --> 07:25.965
it was a few months later
than the original wedding day.

07:26.068 --> 07:29.689
I've never done this before,
so I don't really know
what to expect really.

07:29.793 --> 07:31.586
Today we're going to meet
with the wedding planner.

07:31.689 --> 07:33.551
I've been doing most of
the wedding planning myself

07:33.655 --> 07:36.068
because Evelin told me
it was important for me
to take the lead.

07:37.344 --> 07:39.103
We'll be going over,
like, the cake

07:39.206 --> 07:43.000
and desserts
and what all we wanna have.

07:43.103 --> 07:44.931
I know that we are already
legally married

07:45.034 --> 07:47.241
but it's gonna be really great
now that, you know,

07:48.586 --> 07:50.344
that we have this...

07:50.448 --> 07:52.241
-Hands on the wheel.
-Real wedding.

07:52.344 --> 07:54.551
[chuckles] I don't know,
I won't say that like...

07:54.655 --> 07:56.344
[sighs]

07:56.448 --> 07:58.137
[Evelin] To me,
the meaning of this wedding

07:58.241 --> 08:02.137
is the fact that I'm publicly
giving you a second chance.

08:03.689 --> 08:06.965
I thought, you know, like,
you were excited for me
planning this wedding.

08:07.068 --> 08:09.517
I am going along with this.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.896
Giving you
the chance you asked for.

08:18.551 --> 08:20.896
I'm even making you mad
in your dreams, apparently.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.758
Yeah, [bleep]

08:22.862 --> 08:24.172
What happened in the dream?

08:27.413 --> 08:29.000
I saw the Jenny.

08:30.068 --> 08:32.517
She was telling me
that you were the one.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.827
And I just kept slapping her,
and then I went
and slapped you,

08:35.931 --> 08:37.655
and slapped you so hard
until I woke up

08:37.758 --> 08:39.862
'cause my hands were hurting.

08:39.965 --> 08:43.034
So, I can't even do anything
right even in your dreams.

08:50.586 --> 08:55.103
I've been having dreams
about this Jenny situation.

08:55.206 --> 08:58.310
I wake up super mad at him.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.034
Trust me, I'm trying very
hard to forget about Corey

09:01.137 --> 09:03.586
and this other woman
but I'm a human

09:03.689 --> 09:05.517
and even though
I try so hard to forget,

09:05.620 --> 09:07.482
sometimes
I still get upset about it.

09:22.310 --> 09:25.241
Just like a normal person.

09:25.344 --> 09:29.413
You know how important it is,
not only to your family
but also to my family

09:29.517 --> 09:32.034
the importance
of God and religion.

09:32.137 --> 09:33.586
I just don't wanna get married

09:33.689 --> 09:35.862
in my family's religion
because they believe

09:35.965 --> 09:38.517
that if you get
married through God...

09:38.620 --> 09:41.689
-Yeah...
-It's till death do apart.

09:41.793 --> 09:44.448
That is marriage, Evelin!

09:46.310 --> 09:49.241
It's... to me it's sounds
like, "Okay, great.
I can have this...

09:49.344 --> 09:56.172
this wedding, but any point
I just can divorce Corey
because it's not through God."

09:56.275 --> 09:59.517
You get married
when your relationship
is at their best time.

09:59.620 --> 10:03.413
And I felt like we did that
our first time, but right now?

10:04.931 --> 10:08.827
It's just like trying
to fix a big hole

10:09.620 --> 10:10.862
and we're trying
to fix it with...

10:10.965 --> 10:13.448
I don't know,
a very cheap tape.

10:16.793 --> 10:20.482
It's like you're
already assuming divorce.

10:20.586 --> 10:24.275
If you're a good husband
there is no reason
for me to divorce you.

10:24.896 --> 10:29.862
[tense music playing]

10:29.965 --> 10:33.137
I'm not trying
to be mean to Corey
or trying to punish him,

10:33.241 --> 10:35.586
I just feel like one
of my biggest fears

10:35.689 --> 10:38.413
is giving him the opportunity
to hurt me again.

10:54.206 --> 10:56.137
[Armando] I'm concerned that
my dad won't be comfortable

10:56.241 --> 10:58.137
attending the wedding,
we're going to kiss,

10:58.241 --> 10:59.724
we're going to have
our first dance

10:59.827 --> 11:01.724
and I know
he's not gonna like it.

11:08.655 --> 11:11.379
[Janice] Ari left,
and her apartment was turned

11:11.482 --> 11:15.137
into this crazy place with all
these girls coming in and out.

11:15.724 --> 11:17.068
Let's be real, okay?

11:17.172 --> 11:20.517
Let's talk about reality,
did you cheat on Ari?

11:25.241 --> 11:27.275
[music playing]

11:43.413 --> 11:45.344
[Madison] Watch where
you're going, Cooper.

11:45.448 --> 11:47.689
[Kenny] How far away are they?

11:47.793 --> 11:49.551
Oh, my God.
They are at the front gate.

11:50.827 --> 11:52.034
They're here.

11:52.931 --> 11:55.241
-Tan tada dan.
-I'm nervous.

11:56.689 --> 11:58.206
[Kenny] It's two days
before our wedding

11:58.310 --> 12:02.310
and all of our family members
are arriving today,
including Armando's dad.

12:03.379 --> 12:05.379
[Armando] I didn't really
expect my dad to come

12:05.482 --> 12:09.068
to the wedding, let alone, you
know, days before the wedding.

12:09.172 --> 12:10.965
I hope everything goes smooth

12:11.068 --> 12:14.413
-and there's
no awkwardness or any...
-Yeah.

12:14.517 --> 12:16.965
Negativity or anything,
you know?

12:18.896 --> 12:19.896
Fingers crossed.

12:21.655 --> 12:23.103
[Armando] It is a relief
to know that my dad

12:23.206 --> 12:24.482
will be coming to the wedding,

12:24.586 --> 12:28.241
but since my dad
never responded to me,
never said he was coming,

12:28.344 --> 12:30.586
as a whole,
I am a little fearful

12:30.689 --> 12:32.620
that he's only coming
pressured by my mom,

12:32.724 --> 12:34.620
that she forced him
to be here, um,

12:34.724 --> 12:37.103
'cause I wanted him
to be here on his own accord.

12:37.206 --> 12:40.034
[tense music playing]

12:40.137 --> 12:41.413
[Kenny] Is this them?

12:41.517 --> 12:42.551
[Armando] Oh, yeah.

12:44.482 --> 12:45.482
They're here.

12:46.896 --> 12:47.862
[chuckles]

13:11.241 --> 13:12.586
-[Madison] Cooper come here.
-Copper!

13:12.689 --> 13:14.965
-[Madison] Say hi.
-Hi.

13:15.965 --> 13:18.827
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

13:18.931 --> 13:20.689
Hi, thank you for coming.

13:31.896 --> 13:33.206
How was the trip, mom?

13:33.310 --> 13:35.206
Oh, yes.

13:38.137 --> 13:39.517
[Armando] Let's go inside.

13:41.206 --> 13:43.896
I'll take you downstairs
so you can get settled.

13:46.103 --> 13:49.482
It's a great feeling
to be able to hug my dad,
to know he's here.

13:49.586 --> 13:51.068
But in the back of my head...

13:54.379 --> 13:56.172
and not knowing
what he really is feeling.

13:57.793 --> 14:00.344
He seems happy
and I hope that's the case.

14:10.896 --> 14:13.551
[Armando] We rented
the condo below us,
so my family could be close,

14:13.655 --> 14:15.689
and we could all be together
for the wedding weekend.

14:26.310 --> 14:27.689
[Armando] Uh, okay.

14:38.793 --> 14:41.620
[Armando] I definitely
wish my dad was able
to talk to me more openly.

14:41.724 --> 14:43.965
Him coming
without saying anything,

14:44.068 --> 14:48.034
I'm okay with it,
but I wish he
would open himself up

14:48.137 --> 14:51.586
to tell me exactly
what he's feeling.

14:51.689 --> 14:55.137
It's always easier
to talk to my mom and sister
than it is with my dad.

15:32.827 --> 15:34.517
I sent him a message.

15:34.620 --> 15:38.034
I said the conversation didn't
go as I thought or planned.

15:39.103 --> 15:40.758
I can assure you
that if you had something

15:40.862 --> 15:44.172
important in your life
that really mattered to you,
I'd be there for you.

16:35.275 --> 16:36.758
[Armando] I'm still
concerned that my dad

16:36.862 --> 16:38.413
won't be comfortable
attending the wedding

16:38.517 --> 16:40.068
because we're going to kiss,

16:40.172 --> 16:41.793
we're going
to have our first dance

16:41.896 --> 16:43.724
and I know
he's not gonna like it.

17:04.482 --> 17:08.344
[cheerful music playing]

17:29.000 --> 17:30.620
The diaper bag and that's...

17:30.724 --> 17:31.931
Hey, mom, what are you doing?

17:32.034 --> 17:34.413
Just straightening up
the things that the baby and I

17:34.517 --> 17:36.482
were playing with
all over the floor.

17:36.586 --> 17:38.413
[Ariela] Bini and I got
into a big fight yesterday

17:38.517 --> 17:40.034
when I tried to confront him
about the things

17:40.137 --> 17:43.103
that he's been doing
since I was in America.

17:43.206 --> 17:46.724
So, at this point I'm not sure
there's any hope for us.

17:48.137 --> 17:49.965
So, did he finally
go down for the nap?

17:50.068 --> 17:51.965
-He's asleep now?
-Yeah, he's asleep.

17:53.310 --> 17:55.000
What are you gonna do?

17:55.103 --> 17:57.896
I'm a little bit tired,
I try to sleep when he sleeps.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.310
You're gonna go take a nap?

17:59.413 --> 18:00.586
-Hmm.
-Okay. Well, that's good.

18:00.689 --> 18:03.724
Cause it gives me some time
to spend talking to Biniyam.

18:04.310 --> 18:05.517
All right. Enjoy.

18:05.620 --> 18:06.689
All right, have a good nap.

18:06.793 --> 18:07.862
I'll see you guys.

18:09.551 --> 18:12.275
What do you say
we go down by the beach?
I haven't seen it.

18:12.379 --> 18:14.517
I know there's some
cute little places

18:14.620 --> 18:16.448
to get some food, you want to?

18:18.241 --> 18:19.551
Okay, good. Let's do it.

18:19.655 --> 18:21.620
We can get to know
a little bit of the town.

18:22.551 --> 18:26.034
[cheerful music playing]

18:39.758 --> 18:41.793
[Janice] The interpreter's
gonna meet us here.

18:41.896 --> 18:43.620
[Janice] I texted her to come,
I hope you don't mind,

18:43.724 --> 18:46.965
so, you know, you can
understand what I'm saying.

18:47.068 --> 18:49.137
[Janice] I say a lot of slang.

18:49.241 --> 18:52.689
Biniyam has been
acting very differently
since Ari left Ethiopia,

18:52.793 --> 18:54.620
so I'd like to know

18:54.724 --> 18:59.068
what is going on in his mind
and what the future holds.

19:02.310 --> 19:03.310
Hi, how are you?

19:04.172 --> 19:05.793
I'm so glad you could come.

19:22.793 --> 19:24.620
[Janice] So,
Ari explained to me

19:24.724 --> 19:27.931
that one of the reasons
she wanted to come to Mombasa

19:28.034 --> 19:31.034
was because you had
such a great experience

19:31.137 --> 19:35.793
and that she wanted maybe
to start a new relationship
here with you.

19:40.827 --> 19:42.931
[Janice] But Bini, look...
But let's be real, okay?

19:43.034 --> 19:44.448
-Let's talk about reality.
-[Biniyam] Okay.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.275
[Janice] Ari came home
to have Avi's surgery,

19:47.379 --> 19:49.344
and she was home
for two months, right?

19:49.448 --> 19:55.068
And her father and I
were really nervous
because she cried so much,

19:55.172 --> 19:58.344
every time she was
on the phone she was fighting,

19:58.448 --> 20:00.275
she... I don't know
all the details,

20:00.379 --> 20:03.275
but I know that we got
a lot of messages

20:03.379 --> 20:06.379
from people
about what was going on.

20:06.482 --> 20:08.896
I even got messages
from family,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I'm not gonna
say which family.

20:12.275 --> 20:15.724
The messages we got
were that her house,

20:15.827 --> 20:19.103
her apartment was turned
into this crazy place

20:19.206 --> 20:21.172
with all these girls
coming in and out.

20:22.206 --> 20:25.172
So, we thought maybe
you were not interested

20:25.275 --> 20:27.655
in being with Ari anymore
because when she left

20:28.448 --> 20:29.896
you had a different life,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.655
-so you understand
what I'm saying?
-Yeah.

21:17.241 --> 21:20.000
[Janice] So, he turned
the house into a music studio?

21:20.103 --> 21:21.068
Okay.

21:27.655 --> 21:29.206
She looks very upset.

21:33.896 --> 21:35.586
[Janice] So,
she lost trust in you

21:35.689 --> 21:37.275
because she didn't know
what was happening

21:37.379 --> 21:41.103
and then she thought
you didn't love her anymore
and you had somebody else.

21:41.206 --> 21:42.517
That's what she thought.

21:42.620 --> 21:46.310
So, I have a question for you,
and it can be
yes or no answer,

21:46.413 --> 21:51.137
maybe you're gonna start
like being upset with me
but the question is,

21:51.241 --> 21:54.931
when you were...
when Ari was gone,
did you cheat on Ari?

22:03.310 --> 22:04.620
I just had to ask.

22:11.137 --> 22:13.103
So, there's not
another girl in your life?

22:15.517 --> 22:18.068
Yes! That's the question.

22:18.172 --> 22:21.137
I believe he's telling me
the truth that he did not
cheat on Ari.

22:23.275 --> 22:27.034
There's a lot of visual ques
to someone's answer,

22:27.137 --> 22:30.413
so I feel relieved
that he said no

22:30.517 --> 22:33.137
and that his eyes
said no also.

22:37.137 --> 22:38.827
But why wasn't
she trusting you?

22:43.482 --> 22:46.586
[Janice] But... telling
the truth is always better.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.896
One advice I'm gonna give you,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.448
if you're planning something
you tell Ari first.

23:28.551 --> 23:31.655
Don't tell Frasier
and Wish and Mimi.

23:31.758 --> 23:35.793
Tell Ari first because
what happens is they tell her,

23:35.896 --> 23:38.551
and then she says,
"Biniyam didn't tell me."

23:38.655 --> 23:40.448
When she hears
something from your friend,

23:40.551 --> 23:43.275
or your family
and you didn't tell her...

23:44.655 --> 23:46.448
done. You're done.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.172
That's gonna help you.

23:48.275 --> 23:52.275
That's my only advice
I'm giving you right now.
If you need advice you ask me.

23:58.310 --> 23:59.586
[Janice] Well,
she loves you a lot.

23:59.689 --> 24:03.620
She cried for almost
two months, cried every day.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.586
I'm praying
that it all works out.

24:53.862 --> 24:54.965
[tense music playing]

24:55.068 --> 24:58.034
[Victor] Coming back here
makes me have an emotion

24:58.137 --> 25:00.137
that I'm still
in the hurricane.

25:05.517 --> 25:06.862
Oh, [bleep]

25:06.965 --> 25:09.862
[Ellie] I'm having
a hard time knowing
how to help him.

25:09.965 --> 25:14.137
How do you help somebody
that went through
that kind of experience?

25:15.862 --> 25:17.275
Let's just go down
to the courthouse

25:17.379 --> 25:19.931
and just go ahead and do
the agreement to marry.

25:20.034 --> 25:21.551
We shouldn't keep waiting.

25:21.655 --> 25:24.344
[Sumit] We fight
for this for nine years but...

25:28.448 --> 25:30.482
I'm not pressuring you, right?

25:34.965 --> 25:38.275
[tense music playing]

25:50.827 --> 25:51.862
[Ellie] There's
like more trees

25:51.965 --> 25:54.068
than I thought
that survived, you know?

25:54.517 --> 25:56.482
Like look around.

25:56.586 --> 25:58.379
It's probably
gonna take a while

25:58.482 --> 26:03.000
to get rid of all the wreckage
and fix everything up.

26:05.862 --> 26:08.620
[Victor] Ellie and I are
off to Providence yesterday,

26:08.724 --> 26:11.689
but we have
a little clash and we fight.

26:11.793 --> 26:13.931
Man, the airport
got really destroyed.

26:23.206 --> 26:27.034
Man, this area
looks extra smashed up.

26:27.137 --> 26:31.931
[Victor] I'm taking
Ellie at the place
where we passed the hurricane.

26:32.517 --> 26:34.000
Okay, babe, let's go.

26:35.965 --> 26:41.517
I definitely hope
that this could bring us
together, you know?

26:41.620 --> 26:44.448
[Ellie] All right, careful.
Don't step on any nails.

26:55.137 --> 26:58.758
We are right now
in my sister house.

27:10.172 --> 27:15.000
You know, it was started
to get terrified and think...

27:16.448 --> 27:20.000
there was like a ceiling here
and when the roof went off

27:21.275 --> 27:24.586
the water started
to drip inside here,

27:24.689 --> 27:27.379
the ceiling started
to come down, to come down.

27:30.068 --> 27:32.310
We don't know what to do,

27:32.413 --> 27:35.517
um, my mom and my sister
wanted to run out.

27:36.724 --> 27:38.137
Uh, you can see
this door here?

27:38.241 --> 27:39.206
Yeah.

27:46.034 --> 27:47.758
Oh, [bleep]

27:47.862 --> 27:50.862
Victor, he had
told me a few details,

27:50.965 --> 27:54.793
but I've never heard
that complete explanation,

27:54.896 --> 27:57.172
like just walking
from room to room.

27:57.275 --> 27:59.413
It just makes it,
you know, even more real.

28:00.862 --> 28:03.586
How scary
that would have been.

28:04.620 --> 28:08.172
There's no escape.
There's nowhere to go.

28:08.275 --> 28:12.724
The feeling of no control
is so scary,
that feeling of no control.

28:14.310 --> 28:19.586
I'm gonna show you like
this spot that saved our life.

28:20.965 --> 28:21.965
Oh.

28:25.103 --> 28:27.310
[Victor] My sister
was sitting here.
I was sitting here,

28:27.413 --> 28:29.413
the two kids
was here and my mom.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.103
And the dog too, right?

28:41.827 --> 28:43.310
Oh, my God.

28:46.241 --> 28:47.206
Jesus.

28:50.827 --> 28:53.896
I think about if I was
ever gonna see you again,

28:55.103 --> 28:57.172
I think it was the end.

28:57.275 --> 29:00.482
[Ellie] I could see
how much it's affecting him

29:00.586 --> 29:03.517
and kinda like re-living
through this experience

29:03.620 --> 29:05.689
and It breaks my heart.

29:06.896 --> 29:09.034
I'm having a hard time
actually

29:09.137 --> 29:13.103
knowing how to help him
because it was so insane

29:13.206 --> 29:16.034
what he went through,
like, how do you help somebody

29:16.137 --> 29:19.310
that went through
that kind of experience?

29:19.413 --> 29:21.931
[Victor] If we
wasn't under here, we...

29:22.034 --> 29:25.620
probably would have just get
the roof on top of our head.

29:29.655 --> 29:31.793
That must have been so scary.

29:32.482 --> 29:33.896
No words. Yeah.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.620
It was a horrible moment.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.206
Man, I'm sorry.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.137
Yeah, of course.

29:43.241 --> 29:44.482
I'm sorry, baby.

29:48.206 --> 29:50.413
[Victor] This the first time
I ever come back here.

29:50.517 --> 29:53.827
After seeing that place
that save our life...

30:03.896 --> 30:05.655
But I definitely think

30:06.586 --> 30:09.965
she will never,
ever get to understand

30:10.068 --> 30:12.551
what happened here
that night in the hurricane.

30:14.344 --> 30:16.965
But I think
she did good to come,

30:17.689 --> 30:20.310
to come and see this.

30:22.241 --> 30:25.965
When I saw the island
after that I couldn't
believe the damage.

30:43.413 --> 30:46.103
[calm music playing]

30:46.206 --> 30:48.965
[Ellie] I'm understanding
his mindset right now,

30:49.068 --> 30:52.793
it's only been like
two weeks today that
it happened.

30:52.896 --> 30:55.206
And so, of course
you're gonna be on edge

30:55.310 --> 30:58.413
and I have to be
more sensitive to that.

30:58.517 --> 31:01.931
I just like have
to not take it so personally.

31:02.931 --> 31:05.620
Seeing this and seeing
what you've gone through

31:05.724 --> 31:08.275
I think like it
put things into perspective,

31:09.793 --> 31:12.931
like, there's just
so much more important stuff.

31:13.034 --> 31:15.517
I will have
more patience with you.

31:16.620 --> 31:20.310
I don't wanna add on
to what you're having already.

31:20.413 --> 31:22.586
I just wanna be
like on your side.

31:27.793 --> 31:29.275
Thank you for showing me.

31:30.724 --> 31:33.379
[Ellie] Hm,
I still love you too.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.275
Hey,
this is my oldest son Bryson.

31:39.379 --> 31:40.517
Nice to meet you.

31:40.620 --> 31:41.793
[woman] Finally.

31:41.896 --> 31:43.448
[Kenny] Tonight's
a really big night because

31:43.551 --> 31:45.620
Armando's family
and my family are meeting

31:45.724 --> 31:48.965
for the first time,
they're gonna be all together.
So, it's very exciting.

31:49.068 --> 31:50.068
[laughs]

31:58.413 --> 32:01.379
[Mexican music playing]

32:13.310 --> 32:14.655
[Kenny] I'm coming out front.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.172
[Cassidy] What do
we say at the gate?

32:16.275 --> 32:17.344
We are here for Kenny?

32:17.448 --> 32:20.758
Yeah, just say you are here
for Kenny and Armando.

32:21.896 --> 32:24.000
Earlier today
Armando's family arrived

32:24.103 --> 32:27.103
and we're very excited
that his dad decided to come.

32:27.965 --> 32:29.344
All right.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.172
I'll see you in a second.

32:31.275 --> 32:33.448
Words cannot describe
how I excited I am

32:33.551 --> 32:35.586
to see all my children
here together.

32:36.586 --> 32:37.896
Your auntie is coming.

32:38.931 --> 32:40.793
-Cassidy.
-Everybody is coming.

32:40.896 --> 32:42.310
[Armando] You wanna see them?

32:42.413 --> 32:46.310
So, this is the first time
you're gonna meet my son,
Bryson.

32:46.413 --> 32:48.482
Everybody is
going to be together.

32:48.586 --> 32:50.862
-And with Coop and with you.
-[Armando] Are you excited?

32:50.965 --> 32:51.965
-Yes.
-Happy?

32:52.068 --> 32:53.586
-[Cooper] And you.
-And me.

32:55.310 --> 32:58.379
It's been difficult not being
able to see my children.

32:59.620 --> 33:02.068
The last time I saw
all of my kids together

33:02.172 --> 33:04.206
was actually the rearview
mirror of the car

33:04.310 --> 33:07.758
as I was driving away
to move to Mexico.

33:07.862 --> 33:09.482
You want me to pick you up?

33:11.172 --> 33:13.689
It was one
of the worst days of my life.

33:14.275 --> 33:15.655
I was devastated.

33:17.206 --> 33:18.724
[calm music playing]

33:18.827 --> 33:20.172
[Kenny] I think
they're coming.

33:20.965 --> 33:21.827
Wave to them.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.448
[chuckles]

33:25.551 --> 33:29.000
[Kenny] Bryson and everybody.

33:29.551 --> 33:31.827
-It's everybody.
-Hi!

33:31.931 --> 33:33.413
-Hi!
-Long time no see.

33:37.137 --> 33:38.551
Scoop-scoop.

33:38.655 --> 33:39.931
Come here.

33:40.344 --> 33:42.310
[chuckles]

33:43.620 --> 33:45.241
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:46.827 --> 33:49.931
It is just so wonderful
for me to see all my kids

33:50.034 --> 33:52.172
pour out of that car
and us all being together

33:52.275 --> 33:54.931
for the first time
in a year and a half.

33:57.034 --> 33:59.206
This is Armando.
This is my son Bryson.

33:59.310 --> 34:00.724
Nice to meet you.

34:00.827 --> 34:01.827
Finally.

34:01.931 --> 34:03.172
The two shy guys.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.379
[laughs]

34:05.689 --> 34:07.689
It's absolutely incredible
to finally meet Kenny's son,

34:07.793 --> 34:11.206
Bryson, his girlfriend Crystal
and Cassidy's boyfriend, Josh.

34:11.310 --> 34:14.965
I've been waiting for this,
the whole family is here,
and I couldn't be happier.

34:15.068 --> 34:17.413
How are you doing here?
You having fun?

34:17.517 --> 34:19.379
He's been having a blast.

34:19.482 --> 34:20.517
Look at you.

34:20.620 --> 34:23.034
-Miss grumpy.
-Yeah.

34:23.137 --> 34:25.103
[Kenny] Seeing Cassidy
pregnant for the first time

34:25.206 --> 34:28.000
is amazing for me
and I'm so happy for her

34:28.103 --> 34:31.758
but it really does show
how much time
I really have missed with her.

34:31.862 --> 34:33.689
So, it is very hard for me.

34:35.034 --> 34:37.241
Is it funny
to see them all here?

34:41.344 --> 34:43.758
Um, we have tacos
down by the pool.

34:43.862 --> 34:44.827
We're hungry.

34:44.931 --> 34:45.965
We... we are. [chuckles]

34:46.068 --> 34:48.586
[upbeat music playing]

34:48.689 --> 34:49.827
Do you need help?
I'll help you.

34:49.931 --> 34:51.137
Aw, thank you sweetheart.

34:55.551 --> 34:56.827
[Kenny] Is everybody
excited for this?

34:56.931 --> 34:58.275
Yeah.

34:58.379 --> 34:59.551
Over the top.

34:59.655 --> 35:00.758
[laughs]

35:01.827 --> 35:03.344
[Kenny] Tonight is
a really big night

35:03.448 --> 35:06.689
because Armando's family
and my family are meeting
for the first time

35:06.793 --> 35:09.103
and they're gonna be
all together,
so it's very exciting.

35:09.896 --> 35:10.793
This is...

35:16.000 --> 35:17.275
[laughs]

35:18.275 --> 35:19.482
Hi.

35:19.586 --> 35:21.862
[Kenny] That's Taylor.
That's Armando's sister Debby.

35:21.965 --> 35:23.000
[Both] Hi.

35:23.103 --> 35:24.344
[Armando] Taylor, my dad.

35:24.448 --> 35:26.206
-Hi.
-[Kenny] That's Josh.

35:26.310 --> 35:27.482
Now you've met everybody.

35:27.586 --> 35:28.448
[chuckles]

35:28.551 --> 35:29.551
Hi.

35:30.482 --> 35:32.068
-Who's hungry?
-Me.

35:32.172 --> 35:33.724
-[laughs]
-We have tacos.

35:33.827 --> 35:34.758
Yeah.

35:42.689 --> 35:44.896
Okay, so they
have pork and beef.

35:48.758 --> 35:50.896
[Kenny] Looking out
and seeing Armando's family

35:51.000 --> 35:54.241
and my family interacting,
it warms my heart.

35:54.344 --> 35:55.551
This is my sister Celine.

35:55.655 --> 35:57.000
Hi.

35:57.103 --> 36:00.000
[Kenny] We're really
starting to feel
like a blended family.

36:00.655 --> 36:01.862
Hey, hey, hey.

36:04.137 --> 36:05.551
[Kenny] Armando and I
have been talking

36:05.655 --> 36:07.482
about growing our family more,

36:07.586 --> 36:11.724
but I haven't found
the right time to talk
to my kids about it yet.

36:11.827 --> 36:13.827
It's not like I'm trying
to keep it secret from them,

36:13.931 --> 36:15.896
I just want to tell them
all together and

36:16.000 --> 36:17.758
I want to tell them
face to face,

36:17.862 --> 36:20.448
not over a phone
or over a videocall.

36:20.551 --> 36:22.172
I want it to be face to face.

36:25.241 --> 36:27.586
I don't have a baby yet.
Not yet.

36:27.689 --> 36:28.724
Cooper is the only baby.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.620
[Kenny] I'm nervous
to talk to them

36:31.724 --> 36:34.551
because they really
don't expect it,

36:34.655 --> 36:38.758
I think they think
I'm passed that point
and Hannah would be enough,

36:38.862 --> 36:41.137
but they don't realize,
you know, I have a...

36:41.241 --> 36:43.965
younger soon-to-be husband

36:44.068 --> 36:46.034
and his happiness
and his dreams

36:46.137 --> 36:48.655
need to be fulfilled,
and I want their support

36:48.758 --> 36:50.448
and it really
would be devastating

36:50.551 --> 36:52.172
if I don't have their support.

36:56.655 --> 36:57.586
[tense music playing]

36:57.689 --> 36:59.413
Divorce changed me
as a person.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.034
The person I was before
and now is a big difference.

37:11.068 --> 37:12.344
I'm scared of that.

37:16.827 --> 37:19.620
[Indian music playing]

37:32.551 --> 37:34.517
Gosh, it's so warm out here.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.793
Yeah.

37:35.896 --> 37:38.896
I got spoiled inside
that AC in there.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.931
Earlier today,
Sumit and I went and met
with his family astrologer,

37:43.034 --> 37:45.379
and he gave us the green light
to go ahead and get married.

37:45.482 --> 37:46.896
Yay!

37:47.793 --> 37:49.448
Everything sounds great to me.

37:49.551 --> 37:52.965
-Me too, like--
-He told us
when we can marry

37:53.068 --> 37:57.241
and now we have a lot
of tension up and gone.

37:57.344 --> 38:01.206
I think once
we don't have to worry
about the visa thing anymore,

38:01.310 --> 38:04.034
things for us
are just gonna get better.

38:04.137 --> 38:07.827
So, the astrologist
said nine days from now
would be the earliest, so I...

38:07.931 --> 38:10.793
what I would like
to do is on the tenth day

38:10.896 --> 38:12.448
let's just go down
to the courthouse

38:12.551 --> 38:15.103
and just go ahead and do
the agreement to marry.

38:15.206 --> 38:18.000
And then we'll find out
what we need to do.

38:18.103 --> 38:21.379
We shouldn't keep waiting
because you don't know
what can happen.

38:21.482 --> 38:24.103
And let's not let your mom
change her mind, please.

38:24.206 --> 38:25.482
Yeah, hopefully not.

38:25.586 --> 38:27.482
[Jenny] So,
I suggest the tenth day.

38:27.586 --> 38:28.448
Yeah, okay.

38:28.551 --> 38:29.965
[Jenny] Okay.

38:30.068 --> 38:31.103
Okay.

38:31.931 --> 38:34.034
I'm not pressuring you, right?

38:34.137 --> 38:36.103
I mean, you want
this also like I do?

38:36.206 --> 38:38.000
[Sumit] Yeah. If I say,
like, I love you.

38:38.103 --> 38:41.172
I know you love me.
We both are in love.

38:41.275 --> 38:43.379
We want to stay together,
be together.

38:43.482 --> 38:46.310
But I feel like I'm nervous

38:46.413 --> 38:50.965
because the time which I spent
in my last marriage

38:51.068 --> 38:55.034
and the time I spent,
uh, fighting for divorce was

38:55.137 --> 38:59.275
very bad, like, it was
very hard for me. Like...

38:59.379 --> 39:03.758
I know you're scared, okay?
It's normal.
It's a normal thing.

39:03.862 --> 39:05.689
Everything is gonna be fine.

39:07.931 --> 39:09.931
[Sumit] We fight
for this for nine years,

39:10.034 --> 39:13.379
we fight everything,
I was married, I got divorced,

39:13.482 --> 39:15.275
I go through all
this trouble just,

39:15.379 --> 39:18.068
you know,
to get married with Jenny.
Just to be with Jenny.

39:23.379 --> 39:25.000
But this is the way I feel.

39:27.482 --> 39:30.862
Sometimes you do get mad.

39:30.965 --> 39:35.379
And you do said,
"I'm going back to America.
I'm not gonna live with you."

39:35.482 --> 39:38.103
Like if it's something
happened, like, there were...

39:38.206 --> 39:41.172
you will decide,
I wanna go then

39:41.275 --> 39:44.379
I'd have to go do something
which I'm scared of.

39:44.482 --> 39:47.586
I'm frankly
telling you I'm scared of.

39:47.689 --> 39:49.862
-Yeah.
-[Sumit] Like, you can say
you're scared of marriage,

39:49.965 --> 39:52.275
I don't wanna be
a part of any marriage,

39:52.379 --> 39:54.413
I don't wanna go to court,
I'm scared of that.

40:05.724 --> 40:07.655
-Do you understand
where I'm coming from?
-[Jenny] Yes.

40:10.275 --> 40:11.965
-No, I understand you.
-[Sumit] Yeah.

40:12.068 --> 40:14.482
[Jenny] I mean,
I watched you go through hell.

40:14.586 --> 40:16.931
And that broke my heart.

40:17.034 --> 40:18.793
Divorce changed me
as a person.

40:18.896 --> 40:22.482
The person I was before
and now it's like,
there's a big difference.

40:33.689 --> 40:35.275
What's happening, baby?

40:39.931 --> 40:41.413
Are you okay?

40:43.620 --> 40:46.137
What's happening, baby?
What's happening?

40:47.517 --> 40:50.586
[sad music playing]

40:50.689 --> 40:53.137
It's okay to talk about it,
you need to.

41:10.103 --> 41:12.965
You never will.

41:13.068 --> 41:16.137
I'm not going anywhere,
you can't get rid of me
even if you tried.

41:17.758 --> 41:22.586
I love you so much, I love you
just more than anything and...

41:22.689 --> 41:27.000
Don't worry,
don't have any doubt
in your mind about me, okay?

41:27.103 --> 41:28.793
I will always
be the best for you,

41:28.896 --> 41:33.241
I will always love you
unconditionally forever,

41:33.344 --> 41:37.034
I will never stop loving you,
I will never leave you.

41:37.137 --> 41:40.137
[Sumit] Jenny is
the only person I have
in my life, like...

41:40.241 --> 41:43.000
Jenny is family,
Jenny is my friend,
Jenny is my love.

41:43.103 --> 41:46.448
Jenny is everything to me,
Jenny is the one I talk with,

41:46.551 --> 41:51.172
Jenny is the one I hang out,
shop with, eat, drink, party.
Everything with Jenny.

41:51.275 --> 41:54.689
And if I lose somebody
like that then I don't know,
like, what...

41:58.379 --> 42:00.689
If it happens again
I think I'm gonna be very bad.

42:00.793 --> 42:02.379
It's not gonna
happen again, baby.

42:02.482 --> 42:03.827
You know how much I love you.

42:04.655 --> 42:06.689
I know, I know you love me.

42:06.793 --> 42:09.965
I know... I know I love you.

42:10.068 --> 42:12.655
I'm not happy to hear
that Sumit is afraid

42:12.758 --> 42:16.206
to get married to me,
but I understand his fear.

42:16.310 --> 42:19.344
I know how traumatic
Sumit's first marriage
and divorce was.

42:19.448 --> 42:22.586
I mean, it's only natural
that Sumit might feel
some anxiety,

42:22.689 --> 42:24.551
some fears
about getting married again.

42:24.655 --> 42:26.551
But we are
also getting married

42:26.655 --> 42:29.310
after nine days
and he needs to know that.

42:30.586 --> 42:33.620
I promise you,
don't be afraid, have no fear.

42:37.965 --> 42:40.827
[instrumental music playing]

42:56.620 --> 42:57.931
-Hi, Ari.
-[Ariela] Hi, Mom.

42:58.034 --> 42:59.586
Hey, Avi.

42:59.689 --> 43:01.931
-Grandma's here.
-[Avi mumbling]

43:02.034 --> 43:04.517
Ah, he's talking to me.

43:04.620 --> 43:06.482
Bini and I have been in Kenya
for a few days

43:06.586 --> 43:08.517
and things are not going well.

43:09.103 --> 43:10.931
So, what did you guys do?

43:11.034 --> 43:15.482
We had coffee and just talked
for a long time.

43:15.586 --> 43:17.448
But my mom has been
trying to encourage me

43:17.551 --> 43:19.172
to reconcile with Bini, so,

43:19.827 --> 43:21.965
if she wants to mediate then

43:22.068 --> 43:25.310
maybe Bini and I could repair
our relationship.

43:25.862 --> 43:26.827
What did you talk about?

43:26.931 --> 43:28.862
[Janice] We talked about

43:28.965 --> 43:32.413
the last couple of months,
what's been going on?

43:32.517 --> 43:35.482
I asked Bini, like,
a million questions,

43:35.586 --> 43:37.827
trying to resolve
some of the questions I had.

43:39.103 --> 43:40.000
What do you think?

43:43.517 --> 43:45.413
We're talking about
how do we fix it?

43:47.103 --> 43:48.551
[speaking foreign language]

44:04.103 --> 44:06.862
I explained to him
how we felt and,

44:06.965 --> 44:10.241
uh, he told me
sort of what he was thinking

44:10.344 --> 44:13.241
and it was,
I think it was good.

44:13.344 --> 44:15.310
I guess, does
that make you feel better?

44:16.068 --> 44:17.275
Well, I talked about,

44:17.379 --> 44:20.413
I mean, if you want
me to get specific,
I talked about

44:20.517 --> 44:22.655
how we couldn't communicate
with him.

44:22.758 --> 44:24.689
We didn't know where he was

44:24.793 --> 44:28.551
and a lot of the information
that we got, sent to us was

44:28.655 --> 44:30.689
very disturbing
about his behavior

44:30.793 --> 44:32.931
and how he had changed

44:33.034 --> 44:34.689
and, you know, I just wanted
to get that all out

44:34.793 --> 44:36.413
and talk to him
about it because

44:36.517 --> 44:37.758
I said, you know, this,

44:37.862 --> 44:39.655
I didn't feel
it was the same Biniyam

44:39.758 --> 44:43.206
I had met a year ago,
that he was totally different
when you left.

44:43.310 --> 44:45.724
I'm talking about him
while he's sitting here,

44:45.827 --> 44:47.689
but I actually asked him,
was there somebody else?

44:47.793 --> 44:50.137
Was there another relationship
that he was interested?

44:50.241 --> 44:51.551
I mean, I, you know me.

44:51.655 --> 44:56.137
I didn't spare any words,
right, I asked you everything.

44:56.241 --> 44:57.137
Yes.

44:58.172 --> 44:59.896
[Ariela] I guess,
that's my question again.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.620
Are you satisfied
with, with every answer
that you got today?

45:02.724 --> 45:04.965
Do you feel that
his answers gave you hope

45:05.068 --> 45:06.655
that things can be fixed?

45:08.241 --> 45:09.275
Yes.

45:10.482 --> 45:11.931
After conversing with Biniyam,

45:12.034 --> 45:15.137
I feel very good
about what he told me
and his answers.

45:15.241 --> 45:18.724
And I'm hoping that he uses
the conversation we had

45:18.827 --> 45:21.034
to work with Ari

45:21.137 --> 45:23.103
and have a little
more realization

45:23.206 --> 45:25.241
of the things that he could do

45:25.344 --> 45:27.103
to make her trust him more.

45:28.862 --> 45:31.793
Right now,
this is the important moment

45:31.896 --> 45:33.620
-you're here together.
-[Ariela] Mom.

45:33.724 --> 45:35.034
We'll be, I'll be going soon.

45:35.137 --> 45:37.275
It will be just
the two of you with Avi,

45:37.379 --> 45:40.448
and you're going to have
to talk to each other about
what you guys want.

45:40.551 --> 45:42.310
You have your life
and he's got his,

45:42.413 --> 45:43.862
is it going to be together
with Avi?

45:43.965 --> 45:45.275
Is it going to be separate?

45:46.206 --> 45:48.551
If you guys
are gonna work it out

45:48.655 --> 45:51.586
then he has to regain
your trust.

45:51.689 --> 45:53.551
Because sometimes
he doesn't tell the truth,

45:53.655 --> 45:55.275
so not to have a fight.

45:55.379 --> 45:57.448
-And I told them, that's not,
-I know that,
but that's not okay.

45:57.551 --> 46:00.068
Lot of people do that.
It's not okay.

46:00.172 --> 46:02.655
It's actually one
of the things that's ruining
our relationship.

46:02.758 --> 46:04.310
That's a killer,
that's a killer.

46:04.413 --> 46:06.689
It's better to tell the truth,
face the music right away.

46:06.793 --> 46:09.103
An ugly truth is better than
a beautiful lie.

46:11.379 --> 46:14.448
Clearly my mom's
conversation with Bini
was productive

46:14.551 --> 46:17.931
and although
I'm not sure what I think

46:18.034 --> 46:20.310
I do feel good
knowing that my mom

46:20.413 --> 46:22.862
came away
from talking with Bini
with a positive feeling.

46:24.137 --> 46:25.896
[Biniyam speaking]

46:34.931 --> 46:37.551
I recognized that I could be,

46:37.655 --> 46:39.758
I could try to speak
more calmly.

46:39.862 --> 46:41.310
But the truth is that,

46:41.413 --> 46:43.551
problems don't get solved
by talking.

46:43.655 --> 46:45.448
Talking is just part of it.

46:45.551 --> 46:47.896
People need to
change behavior.

46:52.241 --> 46:53.517
Of course. Of course.

46:53.620 --> 46:57.310
[Janice]
The important thing is to know
that there's problems,

46:57.413 --> 47:00.689
to admit to see
that you have problems

47:00.793 --> 47:02.793
and then to decide
how to fix them.

47:04.103 --> 47:06.655
There's a lot of work
that needs to be done

47:06.758 --> 47:07.862
to rebuild the trust.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.103
But it's really up to him
to show me that

47:11.206 --> 47:15.000
he values the relationship
enough not to make
the same mistakes.

47:16.034 --> 47:17.551
[Janice] The story
is not written yet, Ari,

47:17.655 --> 47:19.758
it's for you guys
to write that story.

47:26.517 --> 47:28.103
[Indian music playing]

47:42.620 --> 47:44.448
[Jenny] Yes, are you ready?

47:45.758 --> 47:46.931
All right. Let's go.

47:48.275 --> 47:51.413
Yesterday, Sumit and I
went and met
with his astrologer

47:51.517 --> 47:54.068
and he told us that our stars
will be favorable for us

47:54.172 --> 47:56.172
to marry in nine days.

47:56.275 --> 47:58.620
And if we wait too long,
then, you know,

47:58.724 --> 48:00.758
the stars
and the planets change.

48:00.862 --> 48:04.206
So, I'm thinking,
let's just go get married
right away then,

48:05.862 --> 48:07.172
per the astrologer.

48:12.172 --> 48:13.689
So today, Sumit and I
are going to meet

48:13.793 --> 48:15.931
with the marriage lawyer
that we met with last year.

48:17.206 --> 48:18.482
Are you ready for this?

48:19.448 --> 48:20.482
I'm excited about it.

48:20.586 --> 48:22.206
I'm happy
to finally be doing it.

48:52.344 --> 48:54.103
[Jenny] So you remember
this lawyer, right?

48:54.206 --> 48:56.620
We already
talked to him before.

48:56.724 --> 48:59.137
You remember, okay,
so you remember the last time

48:59.241 --> 49:02.068
he told us that we could,
you guys can get married
no problem.

49:17.172 --> 49:19.413
[Jenny] Now we need to go back
and ask him what we do now

49:19.517 --> 49:22.379
because we're told
to go to the court
get married that way.

49:22.482 --> 49:24.551
So hopefully, he'll have
some answers for us.

49:25.620 --> 49:27.551
The astrologer
is telling us that

49:27.655 --> 49:29.413
we shouldn't marry
in the temple

49:29.517 --> 49:31.551
because it will cause
our marriage to break.

49:31.655 --> 49:34.000
So, we need to get married
in court

49:34.103 --> 49:36.310
but Sumit and I've been down
this road before.

49:36.965 --> 49:37.793
Hello.

49:38.482 --> 49:39.482
Namaste.

49:39.586 --> 49:42.000
We've been told
over and over again

49:42.103 --> 49:44.517
that it's a long
and complicated process

49:44.620 --> 49:46.241
because I'm a foreigner.

49:46.344 --> 49:48.206
So, I don't know
what our lawyer is gonna say.

49:50.241 --> 49:51.413
[Sumit speaking]

49:52.724 --> 49:53.758
Uh...

49:55.965 --> 49:56.965
Mmm-hmm.

50:28.379 --> 50:29.275
Okay.

50:57.931 --> 50:59.482
Okay.

50:59.586 --> 51:00.931
[Jenny] So is
the Special Marriage Act

51:01.034 --> 51:04.206
definitely the only way
that we can get married

51:04.310 --> 51:05.896
because now we have
to wait 30 days.

51:07.344 --> 51:08.689
[Sumit speaking]

51:10.758 --> 51:14.275
That process takes 30 days,
God damn it.

51:14.379 --> 51:15.482
I'm a little worried.

51:15.586 --> 51:19.103
And I still don't completely
100% trust

51:19.206 --> 51:21.413
the parents, that they're not
going to stop us.

51:21.517 --> 51:23.793
I mean, there's still
a visa situation.

51:23.896 --> 51:25.448
Anything can go wrong.

51:28.241 --> 51:29.275
-Mmm-hmm.
-Okay.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
Okay.

51:35.206 --> 51:37.000
Then let's file
the application today.

51:37.862 --> 51:38.862
Okay.

51:47.379 --> 51:49.034
Hey, no nervous.

52:01.758 --> 52:02.965
[Sumit speaking]

52:29.034 --> 52:30.344
[Jenny] Okay.

52:30.448 --> 52:34.344
I'm satisfied, I'm happy
and thank you so much
once again.

52:34.448 --> 52:36.379
At least, this time
we got somewhere.

52:38.862 --> 52:39.965
Yay!

52:41.758 --> 52:43.379
It's about time.

52:43.482 --> 52:45.068
I'm excited
and happy right now.

52:45.172 --> 52:48.586
This is the first step to
starting our marriage process.

52:56.310 --> 52:57.586
So, I was thinking

52:57.689 --> 52:59.413
-since the wedding
is in a couple of weeks...
-[Corey] Yeah?

53:02.827 --> 53:06.344
No one is closer more to me
than my sister Lesly.

53:07.551 --> 53:09.862
I am definitely 100%
not on board with this.

53:14.965 --> 53:16.103
Uh...

53:23.310 --> 53:24.620
[sighs]

53:28.413 --> 53:29.448
[pleasant music playing]

53:42.551 --> 53:44.724
[Evelin] Hey,
you're cleaning the car?

53:44.827 --> 53:46.793
[Corey] Of course,
it's so dirty.

53:46.896 --> 53:49.517
Yesterday, Evelin and I
met with our wedding planner

53:49.620 --> 53:51.551
to discuss the final plans
for the wedding.

53:51.655 --> 53:54.448
And it finally feels like
things are back on track.

53:54.551 --> 53:56.344
There's really
nice things here, huh?

53:56.448 --> 53:57.620
-[Evelin] Yes.
-You like it, Evelin?

53:57.724 --> 53:59.413
[Evelin] Yeah,
it looks very nice.

53:59.517 --> 54:01.034
[woman speaking]

54:01.137 --> 54:02.551
-It is?
-Yes, it is.

54:02.655 --> 54:04.862
We get flowers. All right.

54:04.965 --> 54:07.862
So cute. Corey,
this is all so beautiful.

54:07.965 --> 54:08.896
Thank you for this.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.068
-You have done amazing.
-Thank you.

54:11.827 --> 54:13.310
-Oh, gross,
-Don't spray me.

54:13.413 --> 54:14.862
[groaning]

54:16.034 --> 54:17.137
My new shoes.

54:18.965 --> 54:21.275
A few weeks before
the wedding, um,

54:21.379 --> 54:25.241
still hesitant
but I am also excited

54:25.344 --> 54:28.689
and back on track
with this wedding planning.

54:28.793 --> 54:31.655
-Oh, Engabao,
that's what happens here.
-Yeah.

54:33.448 --> 54:35.896
So I was thinking
since the wedding
is in a couple of weeks...

54:36.000 --> 54:36.931
Yeah?

54:40.275 --> 54:42.241
Like, I was really hoping
that you would be open

54:42.344 --> 54:44.827
to using
your grandma's pastor.

54:45.689 --> 54:47.241
We are legally married.

54:48.344 --> 54:50.896
But, to me,
that wasn't a wedding.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.862
It was a secret between
me and Evelin

54:52.965 --> 54:56.344
and I think marriage
should be taken seriously.

54:56.448 --> 54:59.448
I know that if we get married
through Evelin's church,

54:59.551 --> 55:02.344
Evelin will also take it
more seriously.

55:03.379 --> 55:05.344
I don't want to get married
through religion

55:05.448 --> 55:07.655
if our marriage
is going to end up
on the divorce, Corey.

55:07.758 --> 55:08.689
You're saying,

55:10.275 --> 55:11.586
it's gonna end in divorce.

55:11.689 --> 55:13.482
-Like, why would you
even say that?
-I'm not saying

55:13.586 --> 55:15.000
it's going
to end it on divorce?

55:15.103 --> 55:16.068
I say if.

55:16.758 --> 55:17.896
-Yeah.
-We'll get divorced.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.827
You're like
putting it out there.

55:19.931 --> 55:21.827
Like, it's a possibility.

55:21.931 --> 55:24.862
I'm just being honest
with you, okay?

55:24.965 --> 55:27.517
I don't want to get divorced.
And it sounds like that--

55:27.620 --> 55:29.344
I don't want to get
divorced, either.

55:29.448 --> 55:30.896
That if I feel that
our relationship

55:31.000 --> 55:32.068
is not strong enough,

55:32.172 --> 55:33.758
I'm going to be prepared
for a bad ending,

55:33.862 --> 55:35.000
if it happens.

55:36.517 --> 55:38.068
You saying...

55:38.172 --> 55:39.724
"If we get divorced,"

55:39.827 --> 55:41.517
does not make me
feel comfortable.

55:42.862 --> 55:45.724
I'm just taking my protections

55:45.827 --> 55:47.586
in case something goes wrong.

55:47.689 --> 55:50.310
You know, that I'm always
prepared for the worst.

55:50.413 --> 55:51.413
Yeah, but...

55:54.344 --> 55:56.931
My family is not okay
with divorce at all.

55:57.034 --> 55:59.793
But the problem is
that it will be way worse

55:59.896 --> 56:02.379
if this is part of the church
as well.

56:03.620 --> 56:04.862
So, you're essentially
saying that

56:04.965 --> 56:07.103
it's just an easier option
to get divorced.

56:08.413 --> 56:10.758
Seriously, like, even when
I go to an airplane,

56:10.862 --> 56:13.379
like I checked
for the exits, first thing.

56:14.931 --> 56:18.068
I need to look
for my exits of this thing.

56:18.172 --> 56:21.000
Not because I'm expecting
the airplane to fall

56:21.103 --> 56:23.000
or I'm expecting
something to happen.

56:23.103 --> 56:26.689
It's just so I know
where the exits are.

56:26.793 --> 56:29.517
So you're basically
saying, you're setting up

56:29.620 --> 56:31.551
our marriage
to have a nice exit,

56:31.655 --> 56:32.793
a smooth exit?

56:32.896 --> 56:34.482
That's what scares me so much.

56:37.137 --> 56:38.068
Sounds really bad

56:38.172 --> 56:40.551
when, you know,
when you talk that way.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.482
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna
say it anymore.

56:44.586 --> 56:46.310
I want you to feel okay,
you're right.

56:46.413 --> 56:47.827
I should have thought about

56:47.931 --> 56:50.034
how it feels
on the other side.

56:50.137 --> 56:51.931
I need to be nicer with

56:52.034 --> 56:55.137
-the way I express.
-Thank you, I appreciate that.

56:55.241 --> 56:57.724
I really do hope that you're
as into this as I am.

56:57.827 --> 57:00.655
-I am.
-Okay, yeah, it's just...

57:00.758 --> 57:03.758
I'm just really stressed
and I'm worried

57:03.862 --> 57:05.482
and got a lot of emotions
going on about this.

57:05.586 --> 57:07.137
-Me, too, Corey.
-So like I just
wanna make sure

57:07.241 --> 57:09.068
we're on the same page here,
you know?

57:09.172 --> 57:11.310
-Yeah. Okay, good.
-Yeah.

57:15.413 --> 57:17.482
We should have someone
that we care about

57:17.586 --> 57:19.896
-and they cares
for us and...
-Yeah.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.413
Someone close and no one
is closer more to me

57:23.517 --> 57:25.275
than my sister Lesly.

57:26.551 --> 57:27.586
So, I was thinking,

57:27.689 --> 57:29.482
-I mean...
-Lesly, your sister?

57:29.586 --> 57:30.931
She's not a pastor, obviously.

57:31.034 --> 57:32.275
[Corey] That doesn't
even make sense.

57:32.379 --> 57:33.448
Yes, it does.

57:35.241 --> 57:36.758
I think, it's cool because

57:36.862 --> 57:40.620
it will be more meaningful
for me than some random
stranger doing it.

57:43.448 --> 57:44.482
Um...

57:45.862 --> 57:47.655
It doesn't make
any sense at all.

57:48.551 --> 57:50.103
That's like the last person
on earth

57:50.206 --> 57:52.241
that I would want to be
officiating our wedding.

57:52.344 --> 57:54.379
-The last person?
-It's the last
person on earth,

57:54.482 --> 57:55.551
that makes sense.

57:55.655 --> 57:57.931
She doesn't even want
us to get married.

57:58.034 --> 57:59.551
What the heck?

57:59.655 --> 58:02.034
Why would you pick her
to be in charge of that?

58:02.137 --> 58:04.000
I think it should be somebody
who respects both of us

58:04.103 --> 58:06.655
because she doesn't want
us to be together,

58:06.758 --> 58:08.896
like that cannot
be more clear.

58:10.241 --> 58:12.965
That's on you
because she has seen
all the stupid things

58:13.068 --> 58:14.103
that you have done.

58:14.206 --> 58:15.517
They have hurt me.

58:15.620 --> 58:17.344
She's a protected sister.
I will do that.

58:17.448 --> 58:19.310
-Exactly!
-I will be worse,

58:19.413 --> 58:23.172
if I saw the boyfriend of her
doing what you've been doing.

58:23.275 --> 58:25.758
That guy were probably
murdered already. So...

58:26.758 --> 58:28.724
I said, I never want
to be engaged.

58:28.827 --> 58:30.965
You make me be engaged.
I never want to be married.

58:31.068 --> 58:32.275
You got me to be married.

58:32.379 --> 58:34.551
Now I'm agreeing
to a public wedding.

58:34.655 --> 58:36.379
At least give me one thing.

58:42.551 --> 58:45.206
But I think
Lesly is our best option.

58:45.310 --> 58:48.724
And I'm hoping that
Corey and her can get along

58:48.827 --> 58:51.413
and we can all
have a nice wedding
and a good relationship.

58:52.862 --> 58:54.758
My family is your family now.

58:58.482 --> 59:01.931
I am definitely 100%
not on board with this.

59:02.034 --> 59:04.896
But I feel like
I need to let Evelin
call the shots here

59:05.000 --> 59:07.413
because I feel like
I am just super lucky

59:07.517 --> 59:11.413
that she's even agreeing
to go through
with the wedding.

59:11.517 --> 59:14.517
My biggest fear about Lesly
being our officiant is,

59:14.620 --> 59:15.931
she'll just think it's a joke.

59:17.103 --> 59:19.034
I don't know if Lesly
is gonna say something

59:19.137 --> 59:23.206
at the altar that is
disrespectful towards me.

59:23.310 --> 59:26.724
She could really humiliate
me in front of everybody.

59:26.827 --> 59:30.620
So, I really don't like Lesly
having that power

59:30.724 --> 59:33.137
because I have no idea
how she's going to use it.

59:38.379 --> 59:42.586
We actually went
to some orphanages.

59:43.379 --> 59:45.000
Adopting a baby?

59:46.000 --> 59:48.275
I'm worried
to lose him altogether.

59:52.724 --> 59:54.206
[Mexican music playing]

1:00:14.172 --> 1:00:16.758
[Kenny] I appreciate you guys
coming to this wedding

1:00:16.862 --> 1:00:19.517
and you making the effort
to do it.

1:00:19.620 --> 1:00:21.068
It's a lot of money.
It's a lot.

1:00:21.172 --> 1:00:23.551
You know, it's a long way.
It's a destination wedding.

1:00:23.655 --> 1:00:27.310
You're coming 3,000 miles.
It's, I know it's not easy.

1:00:27.413 --> 1:00:28.620
You were always there for us.

1:00:28.724 --> 1:00:31.275
So we're definitely
gonna be here for you.

1:00:31.379 --> 1:00:34.310
Having all my children
in Mexico,
all at the same time

1:00:34.413 --> 1:00:37.379
to celebrate our wedding
is very surreal for me.

1:00:37.482 --> 1:00:40.137
It's like truly old times,

1:00:40.241 --> 1:00:42.620
and just everything is rolling
through my head

1:00:42.724 --> 1:00:45.137
after missing them so much.

1:00:45.241 --> 1:00:47.206
It's like, 20 some years
just flew by

1:00:47.310 --> 1:00:48.827
and it just feels like
home again

1:00:48.931 --> 1:00:50.103
having them all around me.

1:00:51.241 --> 1:00:52.241
I know it's,

1:00:54.103 --> 1:00:56.206
been a lot of changes
and stuff

1:00:56.689 --> 1:00:58.620
and... [sniffs]

1:01:01.862 --> 1:01:03.172
I love being your dad.

1:01:03.793 --> 1:01:05.275
Aw. We love you.

1:01:06.379 --> 1:01:08.275
You know, I always wanted
to be a father.

1:01:08.379 --> 1:01:09.689
I always wanted
to be a parent.

1:01:09.793 --> 1:01:11.620
It was my main goal in life,

1:01:13.275 --> 1:01:14.793
was to have kids
and I remember...

1:01:15.655 --> 1:01:17.000
[sighs]

1:01:19.689 --> 1:01:23.000
I realized, I was gay
oh, God, I can't have kids.

1:01:25.793 --> 1:01:27.275
How long did that
thought last,

1:01:27.827 --> 1:01:28.758
like, for you?

1:01:28.862 --> 1:01:30.068
A little while, I thought.

1:01:31.344 --> 1:01:33.103
You know, how,

1:01:33.206 --> 1:01:35.896
because I thought,
do I just go
and marry somebody

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.758
and then get out of it later
or what do I do?

1:01:39.896 --> 1:01:41.724
But I thought I can do
whatever I want to do.

1:01:41.827 --> 1:01:43.793
I'm going to figure it out.
I'm gonna have kids

1:01:44.827 --> 1:01:47.931
and after I had Bryson, um...

1:01:48.034 --> 1:01:49.448
Oh, my God, when I had Bryson,

1:01:50.137 --> 1:01:51.965
you made my dream come true.

1:01:53.551 --> 1:01:56.724
[Bryson] I think it's exciting
watching you put down roots

1:01:56.827 --> 1:01:58.862
and just to get to see you
experience that again
with Hannah.

1:01:59.620 --> 1:02:00.827
It's really exciting.

1:02:01.482 --> 1:02:03.310
Perfect segue.

1:02:03.413 --> 1:02:05.827
And about
what you just said...

1:02:07.724 --> 1:02:09.689
-[Kenny] Huh?
-You're adopting Hannah?

1:02:09.793 --> 1:02:13.586
There's a few things
in the mix.

1:02:13.689 --> 1:02:14.896
Yeah.

1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000
Yes, adopting Hannah would be

1:02:18.206 --> 1:02:19.689
a next step, too.

1:02:20.965 --> 1:02:25.551
But we actually
went to some orphanages here.

1:02:27.827 --> 1:02:29.137
Adopting a baby?

1:02:30.758 --> 1:02:33.310
Why do you want to do that
when you have Hannah

1:02:33.413 --> 1:02:35.172
and you have other kids?

1:02:35.275 --> 1:02:38.793
I have a future husband
that may want it.

1:02:38.896 --> 1:02:41.620
And remember Armando's 32,

1:02:41.724 --> 1:02:45.000
maybe all of his dreams
aren't fulfilled, either yet.

1:02:46.931 --> 1:02:48.413
How's that gonna
work out, though?

1:02:48.517 --> 1:02:50.724
Because it was so hard
getting a marriage license.

1:02:50.827 --> 1:02:52.241
-Well...
-Exactly! Yes.

1:02:52.344 --> 1:02:54.000
...it wouldn't be
an easy road.

1:02:54.103 --> 1:02:56.482
There's still
a lot of unknowns about it.

1:02:56.586 --> 1:02:59.413
But for the most part adoption
would take a while.

1:03:01.620 --> 1:03:04.206
He even brought up
like in vitro and all of that,

1:03:04.310 --> 1:03:07.551
and surrogacy, too,
because it, um,

1:03:09.137 --> 1:03:11.655
would be a shorter process
if you did like that...

1:03:15.241 --> 1:03:16.206
...to...

1:03:18.448 --> 1:03:19.413
I'm just...

1:03:23.413 --> 1:03:25.448
I'm just really shocked,
I'm sorry.

1:03:35.655 --> 1:03:37.724
I don't think he can keep
up with everything.

1:03:37.827 --> 1:03:39.655
If you adopt a kid,
you're gonna get

1:03:39.758 --> 1:03:41.724
so wrapped up in that
like you're gonna forget
about us,

1:03:41.827 --> 1:03:43.379
forget about my kid,

1:03:43.482 --> 1:03:45.482
Forget about future grandkids.

1:03:45.586 --> 1:03:48.172
There's nothing about
the kids that are coming
into your life.

1:03:48.275 --> 1:03:50.344
Like, is he gonna come
and see everyone

1:03:50.448 --> 1:03:52.344
or we're going to have to come
to Mexico all the time?

1:03:52.448 --> 1:03:54.103
It's not gonna work
out like that.

1:04:02.172 --> 1:04:03.379
I miss my dad.

1:04:05.724 --> 1:04:07.103
The old times,

1:04:07.862 --> 1:04:09.379
the simpler times, you know.

1:04:09.965 --> 1:04:11.413
[sniffles]

1:04:11.517 --> 1:04:13.379
My dad and I would just go

1:04:14.310 --> 1:04:16.965
to coffee shops and hang out

1:04:17.068 --> 1:04:19.137
and just sit there
for a couple hours

1:04:19.241 --> 1:04:20.896
drink our coffee and talk

1:04:21.586 --> 1:04:23.379
just about life, anything

1:04:24.206 --> 1:04:26.000
and it wasn't so complicated.

1:04:27.586 --> 1:04:29.724
I think I've lost
a little bit of him,

1:04:30.068 --> 1:04:31.103
for sure.

1:04:31.206 --> 1:04:32.758
[sniffs]

1:04:32.862 --> 1:04:35.655
And I'm worried
to lose him altogether.

1:04:35.758 --> 1:04:37.310
[Kenny] This isn't going
to happen tomorrow,

1:04:37.413 --> 1:04:40.379
but it's something
to think about--

1:04:40.482 --> 1:04:43.034
It's a lot for your own kids
to think about

1:04:43.137 --> 1:04:45.275
when you're thinking about
having another kid.

1:04:45.379 --> 1:04:46.655
I think it's just

1:04:47.689 --> 1:04:50.068
kind of crazy.
I think it's crazy.

1:04:50.172 --> 1:04:53.103
Like, not in a bad way,
but it's just, whoa!

1:04:53.206 --> 1:04:54.517
Never would have thought.

1:04:54.862 --> 1:04:56.862
I do see

1:04:56.965 --> 1:04:58.896
where Taylor is coming from.

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.344
You won't have as much time
for us anymore.

1:05:02.448 --> 1:05:06.620
And like, Cooper and her baby,

1:05:06.724 --> 1:05:10.448
like brings me back,
to like the resentment
that I had.

1:05:10.551 --> 1:05:12.793
You're right, I might not be
able to come back

1:05:12.896 --> 1:05:15.172
for his birth or whatever,
here or there.

1:05:15.275 --> 1:05:18.034
Things are not
going to always be like that.

1:05:18.137 --> 1:05:20.448
But no matter what
I would do in my life,

1:05:23.275 --> 1:05:25.137
I always know who my kids are

1:05:25.241 --> 1:05:28.034
and what they mean to me
and that I would never forget

1:05:28.137 --> 1:05:29.896
any of you ever.

1:05:32.620 --> 1:05:35.206
I'll admit,
I'm a little bit disappointed

1:05:35.310 --> 1:05:37.000
in some of their reactions.

1:05:38.068 --> 1:05:40.344
I thought it would be
a little more supportive

1:05:40.448 --> 1:05:41.689
than what it was.

1:05:41.793 --> 1:05:45.241
So, it does kind
of snap my heart a little bit

1:05:47.655 --> 1:05:49.724
because I honestly thought
they'd be a little more

1:05:49.827 --> 1:05:52.344
on board with it
and a little more supportive.

1:05:54.448 --> 1:05:55.965
You know, I love you,

1:05:56.068 --> 1:05:59.344
I love everybody
more than anything.

1:05:59.448 --> 1:06:01.827
This is a difficult
position for me to be in

1:06:01.931 --> 1:06:03.172
because I've always
been programmed

1:06:03.275 --> 1:06:05.586
to put my children first
and they were the priority.

1:06:05.689 --> 1:06:08.241
And now, to put
my soon to be husband first

1:06:08.344 --> 1:06:09.689
is really hard on me.

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:20.000
Being in this position now
with expanding our family,

1:06:20.103 --> 1:06:21.275
I'm struggling with,

1:06:22.103 --> 1:06:23.206
who do I listen to?

1:06:23.310 --> 1:06:26.068
Do I listen to my heart?
Do I listen to Armando's?

1:06:27.137 --> 1:06:29.034
Do I take into consideration

1:06:29.137 --> 1:06:30.896
what my children
are saying to me

1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:32.793
and their concerns on it?

1:06:34.034 --> 1:06:36.206
Now, I'm really struggling

1:06:36.310 --> 1:06:38.586
like in my brain
and in my heart

1:06:38.689 --> 1:06:41.413
exactly how to really navigate
through this.

1:06:50.517 --> 1:06:53.482
This is too expensive
and the other thing
is too expensive.

1:06:53.586 --> 1:06:54.793
Money is not everything.

1:06:54.896 --> 1:06:57.689
Okay, if it's not everything
I'll stop giving you money.

1:06:57.793 --> 1:06:59.275
You don't have
to give me money.

1:06:59.379 --> 1:07:03.379
I don't feel like,
I'm here right now today
because of you.

1:07:03.862 --> 1:07:05.137
Wow.

1:07:05.241 --> 1:07:07.172
You know, I'm just going
to take a break.

1:07:08.034 --> 1:07:09.724
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

1:07:14.103 --> 1:07:15.000
[slow instrumental
music playing]

1:07:30.448 --> 1:07:32.724
Babe, can I pour you a drink,
do you want to drink?

1:07:32.827 --> 1:07:34.413
[Ellie] Yeah, what you got?

1:07:34.517 --> 1:07:36.000
I got some Colombian rum.

1:07:36.931 --> 1:07:38.068
It's nice.

1:07:38.172 --> 1:07:39.965
-[Ellie] I would love
that, thank you.
-All right.

1:07:57.103 --> 1:08:00.103
Our little house,
looking nice already.

1:08:00.206 --> 1:08:03.344
Yeah, I love this place.
I feel like it's home.

1:08:03.448 --> 1:08:04.862
Just need some roof.

1:08:06.551 --> 1:08:08.551
Do you think love
is holding it together?

1:08:08.655 --> 1:08:09.655
I think so.

1:08:09.758 --> 1:08:11.793
-I think love...
-[chuckling]

1:08:11.896 --> 1:08:12.931
...is holding it together.

1:08:14.965 --> 1:08:17.413
Hopefully, when we get
to San Andres we can

1:08:17.517 --> 1:08:19.655
-get what we need to...
-Come back.

1:08:19.758 --> 1:08:22.137
Come back and start
living here.

1:08:22.241 --> 1:08:23.310
Yeah.

1:08:30.241 --> 1:08:32.413
-We've been here for
at least forever.
-Yeah.

1:08:33.413 --> 1:08:35.931
-Forever. [laughs]
-Yeah.

1:08:36.034 --> 1:08:39.068
Imagine that.
It's gonna be a nice amazing.

1:08:39.862 --> 1:08:40.896
Yeah. [laughs]

1:08:42.931 --> 1:08:46.448
But I've been thinking about
like proposing to Ellie,

1:08:46.551 --> 1:08:48.793
from a long time
on the beach that we met.

1:08:48.896 --> 1:08:51.068
Ellie and I used to talk about

1:08:51.172 --> 1:08:52.241
like getting married

1:08:52.344 --> 1:08:55.517
and having a kid
so we can give Allego,

1:08:55.620 --> 1:08:58.068
my daughter, a little
brother or a sister.

1:08:58.724 --> 1:09:00.068
But then the pandemic hit

1:09:00.172 --> 1:09:03.241
and then we never talk
about that anymore.

1:09:03.344 --> 1:09:07.586
I'm just waiting
on the right moment
to bring it up again.

1:09:08.068 --> 1:09:10.896
To... Our house.

1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.413
-To our house.
-And our future...

1:09:13.517 --> 1:09:16.275
Our future and much more
nice thing that's coming up.

1:09:16.379 --> 1:09:17.448
Yeah.

1:09:17.551 --> 1:09:21.344
It can only go up from here.
I don't think we can

1:09:21.448 --> 1:09:23.034
hit anymore bottom.

1:09:23.137 --> 1:09:25.310
If we go any [bleep] lower
than this, it's hard.

1:09:25.413 --> 1:09:26.379
That would be real low.

1:09:26.482 --> 1:09:27.551
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:09:29.655 --> 1:09:32.448
[Victor] This is making us
a little bit more closer
to each other.

1:09:32.793 --> 1:09:33.793
You think,

1:09:34.931 --> 1:09:37.551
you're ready
to have a kid with me?

1:09:38.655 --> 1:09:41.620
I mean, we have talked about
that before.

1:09:41.724 --> 1:09:44.724
You know that I would try

1:09:44.827 --> 1:09:47.724
but I just, you know,
I don't know like if

1:09:47.827 --> 1:09:50.000
I'm able to get pregnant.

1:09:50.103 --> 1:09:52.827
Well, if we don't try,
you don't know.

1:09:52.931 --> 1:09:55.482
Well, I feel like
we have been trying.

1:09:55.586 --> 1:09:56.896
Yeah.

1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:01.689
We can try and be, you know,
be serious with it.

1:10:01.793 --> 1:10:03.758
Oh, you know, start tonight.

1:10:03.862 --> 1:10:06.758
We're going to start tonight,
last night, every night.

1:10:07.482 --> 1:10:08.965
[both laugh]

1:10:12.482 --> 1:10:15.896
[Ellie] Victor wants
to have kids, really a ton.

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.379
-But, you know, I...
-But, you don't wanna?

1:10:19.482 --> 1:10:20.724
No. I do. I do.

1:10:20.827 --> 1:10:24.241
I'm just, like, I'm not going
to get my hopes up

1:10:24.344 --> 1:10:28.448
because I know my probability
goes down with age.

1:10:30.172 --> 1:10:32.482
I'm kind of like at the age
like it's harder

1:10:32.586 --> 1:10:34.655
-to get pregnant, you know.
-Yeah.

1:10:36.793 --> 1:10:40.689
-Like, this house is
perfect for us.
-Yeah.

1:10:40.793 --> 1:10:44.655
But where are we going
to put another person?

1:10:44.758 --> 1:10:47.034
For the first few months,

1:10:47.137 --> 1:10:50.551
I would have a problem
sleeping with us.

1:10:50.655 --> 1:10:51.827
Yeah, of course.

1:10:51.931 --> 1:10:55.482
Then I definitely think
we have to make an investment

1:10:55.586 --> 1:10:56.896
and build another room.

1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.689
I mean, have you thought
like logistically about

1:10:59.793 --> 1:11:04.655
things, like, how much
it costs to, like,
raise a baby?

1:11:04.758 --> 1:11:07.103
Like, babies cost
a lot of money, you know.

1:11:07.206 --> 1:11:08.724
Yeah, that's true.
That's true.

1:11:08.827 --> 1:11:11.206
I know baby
cost a lot of money

1:11:11.310 --> 1:11:13.724
and we need to work.

1:11:13.827 --> 1:11:16.827
But, that's why we're gonna
make a bar,

1:11:17.551 --> 1:11:19.103
work hard

1:11:19.206 --> 1:11:20.896
every day, make money.

1:11:22.034 --> 1:11:23.413
I'm just wondering like,

1:11:23.517 --> 1:11:26.620
I wonder when tourism
will come back

1:11:26.724 --> 1:11:29.965
because we can get this place
ready pretty quickly.

1:11:30.068 --> 1:11:31.724
But even if we're
completely ready

1:11:31.827 --> 1:11:33.896
and we're ready
to sell drinks and food,

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.379
like if there's nobody
to buy them, you know?

1:11:39.586 --> 1:11:41.344
We don't know when tourism
is gonna come up.

1:11:42.689 --> 1:11:44.275
[Ellie] Victor and I
had a plan,

1:11:44.379 --> 1:11:46.655
open on beach bar
in Providencia

1:11:46.758 --> 1:11:50.586
and just like,
live a really chill
island lifestyle.

1:11:50.689 --> 1:11:53.724
That plan has totally got
blown up with the hurricane.

1:11:53.827 --> 1:11:57.482
There's no tourists right now,
like, people on the island

1:11:57.586 --> 1:12:00.241
it's not like they're going
to a bar right now.

1:12:00.344 --> 1:12:03.413
It's going to be really
difficult to support
ourselves.

1:12:04.655 --> 1:12:08.000
As long as they have
electricity and flights come.

1:12:08.103 --> 1:12:10.206
Well, they need places
to stay, too.

1:12:11.310 --> 1:12:13.310
We're only thinking
about tourists

1:12:13.413 --> 1:12:16.000
and if tourists doesn't come,
what then we starve, we dead?

1:12:17.413 --> 1:12:19.379
That was the whole like

1:12:20.482 --> 1:12:22.172
concept of our place.

1:12:22.275 --> 1:12:24.862
So, of course,
I have to care about that.

1:12:24.965 --> 1:12:27.448
The whole concept
of our place is a bar.

1:12:28.379 --> 1:12:30.275
The bar is for everyone.

1:12:31.137 --> 1:12:32.724
You're just focused
on tourists.

1:12:32.827 --> 1:12:36.206
-I'm not just focused
on tourists...
-I live here, I live here,

1:12:36.310 --> 1:12:37.965
I'm focused on reality.

1:12:41.137 --> 1:12:44.551
Ask everyone here
that's been through Covid

1:12:44.655 --> 1:12:46.862
and hasn't had that income

1:12:46.965 --> 1:12:49.965
-for seven months--
-They still survive.

1:12:50.068 --> 1:12:51.862
-And it was hard, wasn't it?
-They still survive.

1:12:51.965 --> 1:12:54.206
Who was sending,
who was sending you money?

1:12:54.310 --> 1:12:57.689
I was, because you couldn't
make any money from tourism.

1:12:57.793 --> 1:12:59.103
-Thank you for that.
-Yeah.

1:12:59.206 --> 1:13:02.413
You did only sending me money
for me to eat or live.

1:13:02.517 --> 1:13:05.586
You know, you're sending
me money for us
to build this project.

1:13:12.448 --> 1:13:14.827
You always get so defensive.

1:13:16.137 --> 1:13:18.275
I asked like normal questions

1:13:18.379 --> 1:13:21.172
that every normal adult
would ask.

1:13:25.793 --> 1:13:26.827
Okay.

1:13:32.689 --> 1:13:36.206
He's denying what's really
right in front of him.

1:13:36.310 --> 1:13:37.793
That's how he worked,

1:13:37.896 --> 1:13:40.931
he worked in a bar
where there were tourists

1:13:41.034 --> 1:13:42.379
and that's how he made money.

1:13:42.482 --> 1:13:45.103
Like, I don't know
why he's being so stubborn.

1:13:47.931 --> 1:13:49.586
You have a money problem.

1:13:49.689 --> 1:13:51.344
-That's your point.
-Yeah. Really.

1:13:51.448 --> 1:13:52.931
I think you have
a money problem.

1:13:53.034 --> 1:13:55.000
And all you thinking
about is money

1:13:55.103 --> 1:13:56.379
and this is too expensive,

1:13:56.482 --> 1:13:57.758
and the other thing
is too expensive.

1:13:57.862 --> 1:13:59.689
And how much
this is going to cost,

1:13:59.793 --> 1:14:02.068
how much that is
going to cost?

1:14:02.172 --> 1:14:04.448
If tourists doesn't come,
we're not going to sell.

1:14:04.551 --> 1:14:07.103
You think money is everything.
Money is not everything.

1:14:07.206 --> 1:14:10.000
Okay, if it's not everything
I'll stop giving you money.

1:14:10.103 --> 1:14:11.517
You don't have
to give me money.

1:14:11.620 --> 1:14:12.965
You don't have to give
me any money.

1:14:13.068 --> 1:14:14.896
I can work and get
my own money.

1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:16.517
Really, because that's not
all you--

1:14:16.620 --> 1:14:18.310
-[Victor] I can work
and get my own money.
-Okay.

1:14:19.206 --> 1:14:20.448
I can play my music.

1:14:20.551 --> 1:14:23.448
I make my own money.
Before I met you, I survived.

1:14:23.551 --> 1:14:27.517
Don't feel like I'm here
right now today because
of you.

1:14:31.724 --> 1:14:33.000
Really, you want to add it up?

1:14:33.103 --> 1:14:34.413
It's been quite a lot.

1:14:34.517 --> 1:14:37.000
Maybe if you send me
the amount of money

1:14:37.103 --> 1:14:39.137
I would just have a bike
at least.

1:14:39.241 --> 1:14:40.172
[scoffs]

1:14:40.275 --> 1:14:42.827
Oh, Lord. Wow!

1:14:42.931 --> 1:14:43.965
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1:14:44.068 --> 1:14:46.965
You know, I'm just gonna
take a break and relax.

1:14:47.068 --> 1:14:48.379
That's probably a good idea.

1:14:49.931 --> 1:14:51.137
[scoffs]

1:14:52.206 --> 1:14:53.137
Okay.

1:14:55.448 --> 1:14:59.517
I don't like people
like showing [bleep] in
my face like that, you know?

1:14:59.620 --> 1:15:01.379
I've been doing this
with my heart.

1:15:01.482 --> 1:15:03.034
You know, you can see
what I've been doing.

1:15:04.931 --> 1:15:07.758
Oh, you're gonna be
such a [bleep].

1:15:16.448 --> 1:15:18.551
[Neeraj speaking]

1:15:18.655 --> 1:15:20.310
[Sumit speaking]

1:15:39.034 --> 1:15:40.344
[Indian music playing]

1:15:51.896 --> 1:15:54.000
[Indian song playing]

1:16:12.724 --> 1:16:14.103
[speaking Hindi]

1:16:16.241 --> 1:16:17.689
[in English]

1:17:11.275 --> 1:17:13.068
[Sumit laughs]

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:23.172
Uh...

1:19:12.827 --> 1:19:14.448
[Sumit speaking]

1:20:43.586 --> 1:20:45.655
[dramatic music playing]

1:20:53.068 --> 1:20:54.827
[Sumit stammering]

1:22:19.241 --> 1:22:20.758
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1:22:37.931 --> 1:22:39.344
[sighs]

1:22:55.310 --> 1:22:56.965
[Neeraj speaking]

1:23:16.586 --> 1:23:17.862
[sighs]

1:23:20.206 --> 1:23:23.068
[narrator] Next time on
90 Day Fiance: The Other Way.

1:23:23.172 --> 1:23:24.896
[Steven] The universe
is telling us to get married

1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.068
so we're gonna get married.

1:23:26.172 --> 1:23:27.862
[speaking foreign language]

1:23:42.689 --> 1:23:44.448
[Corey] I'm just
calling to find out

1:23:44.551 --> 1:23:46.793
if you're able to make it
to the wedding or not.

1:23:53.896 --> 1:23:57.586
I get married one time,
and I'm the only one here.

1:23:57.689 --> 1:23:58.896
If it's important
enough to you,

1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:00.206
you're gonna make it happen.

1:24:02.551 --> 1:24:04.793
I'd like us
to try to go to the U.S.

1:24:04.896 --> 1:24:06.344
If you'd like to do that,
then I think

1:24:06.448 --> 1:24:08.241
we could have
a really successful marriage

1:24:08.344 --> 1:24:10.103
and a happy life together.

1:24:10.206 --> 1:24:11.758
[speaking foreign language]

1:24:14.827 --> 1:24:16.448
It's wedding day.

1:24:16.551 --> 1:24:17.724
I didn't wake up this morning

1:24:17.827 --> 1:24:20.344
and I did kind of get
a little bit sick
to my stomach,

1:24:20.448 --> 1:24:23.206
just thinking
of my dad seeing us.

1:24:23.310 --> 1:24:25.758
I don't want them
to be, like, disgusted
or anything like that.

1:24:25.862 --> 1:24:28.000
[Kenny] I'm about to marry
the man of my dreams.

1:24:28.103 --> 1:24:30.758
So, I don't like discussing
in our first kiss

1:24:30.862 --> 1:24:32.344
to be in the same sentence.

1:24:33.344 --> 1:24:35.344
[Victor speaking]

1:24:36.172 --> 1:24:37.275
[Ellie] I never even,

1:24:37.379 --> 1:24:40.344
I never even said
I wanted it back.

1:24:43.275 --> 1:24:47.379
I want to magically
not be here anymore.

1:24:47.482 --> 1:24:50.172
[crying]

1:24:50.275 --> 1:24:52.724
We're gonna be able
to marry in about 30 days.

1:24:53.448 --> 1:24:55.586
[Sumit speaking]

1:24:59.103 --> 1:25:01.551
[Jenny] This is stupid,
I'm not doing this anymore.

1:25:01.655 --> 1:25:04.241
Don't let him use you,
the day you leave,

1:25:04.344 --> 1:25:06.344
he will make a decision.

1:25:06.448 --> 1:25:08.862
If I want Sumit to know
how serious I am

1:25:08.965 --> 1:25:10.586
then probably I should go.

1:25:11.413 --> 1:25:12.310
Just walk away.
