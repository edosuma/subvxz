00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching on 123Movies.to

02:13.200 --> 02:18.910
The monk you sent
to find your wife is dead.

02:18.955 --> 02:22.500
Did you hear?

02:47.650 --> 02:50.240
When I was nine years old...

02:50.280 --> 02:56.620
...my father took me to the Merkit clan
to choose a bride.

02:56.660 --> 02:59.080
He stole my mother from the Merkits...

02:59.120 --> 03:04.125
...and they never forgot it.

03:06.545 --> 03:08.460
Now he needed peace...

03:08.505 --> 03:14.340
...so I had to take a Merkit bride.

03:17.430 --> 03:22.850
I couldn't say no to my father.

03:27.690 --> 03:31.195
My friend Dai Sechen lives here.

03:31.236 --> 03:36.324
Let's stop here for a night!

03:55.760 --> 03:57.387
Welcome, my friend Esugei!

03:57.429 --> 04:01.266
Good to see you!

04:02.934 --> 04:06.897
Your son got big!

04:13.486 --> 04:15.697
What's your name?

04:15.739 --> 04:17.072
Temudgin.

04:17.115 --> 04:22.329
It's me that should ask first.

04:24.623 --> 04:26.708
How old are you?

04:26.750 --> 04:29.336
Nine.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.091
You're even younger than me!

04:35.133 --> 04:36.843
By a lot?

04:36.885 --> 04:39.888
By a whole year.

04:39.930 --> 04:42.140
Why did you come here?

04:42.182 --> 04:44.893
I'm going to the Merkits
to choose a bride.

04:44.935 --> 04:47.354
I'm here for the night.

04:47.395 --> 04:52.817
Smart people choose our brides.

04:53.944 --> 04:57.906
Goodbye, Temudgin.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.117
Wait!

05:01.159 --> 05:02.577
What's your name?

05:02.619 --> 05:03.912
Borte.

05:03.954 --> 05:05.747
Temudgin!

05:05.789 --> 05:10.168
You should choose me!

05:30.021 --> 05:31.731
Let's fight, Targutai!

05:31.773 --> 05:36.778
I'm drunk, you can beat me.

05:51.418 --> 05:57.340
You're not just a fool, you're weak!

06:21.114 --> 06:26.077
These mosquitoes are hungry!

06:26.119 --> 06:31.458
I want to look for a bride here.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.337
This clan's weak.

06:37.088 --> 06:40.842
People come here for brides.

06:40.884 --> 06:46.598
I must make peace with the Merkits.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.895
I want to practice.

06:51.937 --> 06:56.733
You can't just practice.
They'll be offended.

06:56.775 --> 07:02.822
If they're weak,
let them be offended.

07:05.450 --> 07:09.329
Listen carefully to what I tell you.

07:09.371 --> 07:14.876
Don't make a mistake
when you choose a bride.

07:14.918 --> 07:20.048
Her face has to be flat like a salt lake.

07:20.090 --> 07:24.886
Her eyes have to be narrow.

07:24.928 --> 07:28.765
Evil spirits dive into big eyes...

07:28.807 --> 07:33.603
...and she will go mad...

07:34.479 --> 07:38.608
...seeing things that aren't there.

07:38.650 --> 07:42.946
And most important:
Don't forget to look at her legs.

07:42.988 --> 07:48.827
A woman has to have strong legs...
to make a man happy.

07:48.869 --> 07:52.080
Understand?

08:17.564 --> 08:20.066
I choose you.

08:20.108 --> 08:23.028
I agree.

08:27.449 --> 08:31.912
I have chosen my bride.

08:40.962 --> 08:43.423
I'll give a sable coat for her.

08:43.465 --> 08:49.054
Your son made a good choice, Esugei.

08:49.095 --> 08:52.349
For sure he saved us time.

08:52.390 --> 08:56.228
We can ride back home now.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.687
You're right!

08:57.729 --> 09:03.109
For my clan, it is a great honor.

09:03.151 --> 09:08.240
They can marry in five years.

09:10.742 --> 09:13.328
This is a wishbone from a white raven.

09:13.370 --> 09:18.166
Rub it and make your wish.

09:20.168 --> 09:25.090
I'll be back in five years.

09:27.467 --> 09:34.140
Why didn't you listen to me?
You're stubborn.

09:34.182 --> 09:38.144
I saw her and I knew she's my wife.

09:38.186 --> 09:41.106
What will I say to the Merkits now?

09:41.147 --> 09:50.574
My head hurts thinking about it.
Merkits will never forget this offense.

09:50.615 --> 09:53.827
We rode back home.

09:53.869 --> 09:58.248
My father didn't talk.

10:00.250 --> 10:03.170
Finally he said to me:

10:03.211 --> 10:10.093
"You did good.
A man has to choose his wife."

10:12.554 --> 10:15.765
I didn't know that day...

10:15.807 --> 10:21.229
...would change my life forever.

10:43.460 --> 10:46.296
Scared?

10:46.922 --> 10:48.798
Yes.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.134
Thunder means...

10:51.176 --> 10:54.846
...our God Tengri is angry.

10:54.888 --> 11:00.101
All Mongols are afraid of it.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.628
Enemies.

11:26.670 --> 11:28.338
So what?

11:28.380 --> 11:34.511
You can't spill blood by a rest place.

11:55.657 --> 11:57.993
Accept this milk from my master.

11:58.034 --> 12:01.371
Thanks. Sit.

12:19.890 --> 12:23.018
Thank you.

12:28.523 --> 12:34.654
Esugei, let the servant drink it first.

12:34.779 --> 12:39.576
See how they're looking at us.

12:39.618 --> 12:42.621
They're our enemies.

12:42.662 --> 12:46.082
But if I, Khan Esugei,
start breaking the customs...

12:46.124 --> 12:51.880
...the world will turn upside down.

13:19.866 --> 13:22.244
Are you sick, Esugei?

13:22.285 --> 13:24.871
Let's stop.

13:24.913 --> 13:30.836
Shut up! It's not for you to decide.

13:53.859 --> 13:58.655
They've poisoned our Khan!

14:05.078 --> 14:09.249
You little bastard!

14:20.760 --> 14:22.762
I'm leaving you, my son.

14:22.804 --> 14:26.433
You'll be Khan now.

14:26.474 --> 14:29.227
Be strong...

14:29.269 --> 14:34.274
...and ask our Lord of the Blue Sky,
Great Tengri...

14:34.316 --> 14:38.069
...to help you.

15:18.068 --> 15:21.821
Take everything!

15:29.162 --> 15:31.289
Don't you dare!

15:31.331 --> 15:36.545
That's the herd of your Khan!

15:37.462 --> 15:40.340
He protected you!

15:40.382 --> 15:45.595
Get away from there! Stop it!

15:51.810 --> 15:57.023
You ungrateful piece of shit!

15:59.818 --> 16:02.320
You're not afraid to steal, Targutai?

16:02.362 --> 16:05.949
No! Khan Esugei is dead!

16:05.991 --> 16:11.955
My son is Khan now! He'll avenge us!

16:15.625 --> 16:20.297
You want me to kill him?

16:23.842 --> 16:25.969
Run! Quick!

16:26.011 --> 16:27.929
Catch him!

16:27.971 --> 16:30.473
Run!

16:43.069 --> 16:45.405
You have the devil in you!

16:45.447 --> 16:47.949
Targutai!

16:47.991 --> 16:52.287
What's come over you?

17:02.672 --> 17:06.425
Mongols don't kill children!

17:06.468 --> 17:08.094
I curse you!

17:08.136 --> 17:11.556
Rot in hell!

17:16.685 --> 17:18.396
As Esugei said:

17:18.438 --> 17:24.277
Never break the customs,
even if you want to.

17:24.319 --> 17:29.741
When he grows up, I'll kill him.

17:47.592 --> 17:50.428
He will grow up soon.

17:50.470 --> 17:56.226
We'll come after him in the winter.

18:04.025 --> 18:06.653
Someday...

18:06.695 --> 18:11.700
...you'll have to kill him.

18:14.536 --> 18:19.124
But save yourself first.

18:27.090 --> 18:32.929
That winter I had no place to hide.

18:39.269 --> 18:42.981
I went to the Sacred Mountain...

18:43.023 --> 18:48.528
...to ask our God Tengri to help me.

18:48.570 --> 18:52.240
I was on my own.

18:52.282 --> 18:56.786
The mountain was far away.

18:56.828 --> 19:01.333
And I ran for my life.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.272
Hey!

20:11.486 --> 20:13.363
I'm Jamukha.

20:13.405 --> 20:16.116
What's your name?

20:16.157 --> 20:20.328
My name is Temudgin.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.505
A Mongol has to be on a horse.

20:30.547 --> 20:36.720
My enemy Targutai took all our horses.

20:48.356 --> 20:52.944
Will you be my brother?

21:30.106 --> 21:34.611
Taichar, give me a rag.

21:43.912 --> 21:46.957
We're blood brothers now.

21:46.998 --> 21:50.168
When I become Khan,
I'll make you my second-in-command.

21:50.210 --> 21:52.379
Jamukha...

21:52.420 --> 21:56.424
...I must kill my enemy Targutai first.

21:56.466 --> 22:01.888
How can you? You have no horse.

22:06.852 --> 22:11.523
My bride has strong legs.

22:12.440 --> 22:16.820
Who cares about legs?

22:19.030 --> 22:24.452
My father said it makes a man happy.

22:24.494 --> 22:30.333
You need a horse more than a woman.

22:53.273 --> 22:55.775
Run!

23:49.496 --> 23:52.541
Targutai!

23:55.418 --> 23:59.965
Tell people I don't want to be Khan.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.633
You're a dog.

24:01.675 --> 24:05.470
Nobody cares about you anymore.

24:05.512 --> 24:08.223
Why do you still want to kill me?

24:08.265 --> 24:11.685
I'll sleep better.

24:11.726 --> 24:15.272
I'll kill you!

24:15.647 --> 24:19.234
I'll kill you first.

24:19.276 --> 24:22.195
Bastard!

24:45.594 --> 24:50.056
You need to be strong.

24:50.432 --> 24:52.934
Eat!

24:54.811 --> 24:57.522
Drink.

25:04.946 --> 25:10.368
These flies... suck your blood.

25:12.454 --> 25:14.748
Temudgin!

25:14.789 --> 25:17.125
Your family is safe.

25:17.167 --> 25:20.504
Don't worry.

25:23.298 --> 25:25.759
Jamukha! Find my bride.

25:25.800 --> 25:30.514
Tell her to wait for me.

25:36.353 --> 25:37.979
He's still short.

25:38.021 --> 25:40.148
Feed him more!

25:40.190 --> 25:45.820
When I get back, I want him grown.

27:10.238 --> 27:12.699
Great Tengri, Lord of the Blue Sky!

27:12.741 --> 27:19.080
I bow before you.
Free me, Great Tengri!

29:53.735 --> 29:57.155
No matter how far the wolf runs...

29:57.197 --> 30:01.910
...he comes home one day.

30:24.850 --> 30:27.894
Temudgin.

30:33.525 --> 30:36.486
I've been waiting for you.

30:36.528 --> 30:39.990
I'm Khan now.

30:40.073 --> 30:44.494
I'm smarter than your father.

30:44.536 --> 30:47.080
He was a fool.

30:47.122 --> 30:51.209
You call yourself Khan?

30:51.251 --> 30:55.422
Shit is always shit.

30:56.631 --> 31:04.264
I won't just kill you.
I'll kill you piece by piece.

31:06.558 --> 31:10.061
You see the wooden donkey?

31:10.103 --> 31:13.982
I'll nail you to it myself!

31:14.024 --> 31:18.612
It takes a week to die!

31:38.632 --> 31:42.886
Come closer, old man.

31:46.681 --> 31:50.227
You scare me!

31:56.983 --> 31:58.693
If I don't die...

31:58.735 --> 32:00.737
...I'll forgive all of you.

32:00.779 --> 32:05.909
You won't forgive any of us.

32:31.893 --> 32:33.436
Come here.

32:33.478 --> 32:37.023
Give me water.

32:38.483 --> 32:40.235
You idiot.

32:40.277 --> 32:41.236
Shut up!

32:41.278 --> 32:46.491
I'll show you who's an idiot.

33:44.758 --> 33:47.969
Don't move!

33:59.856 --> 34:01.191
I'm Temudgin.

34:01.233 --> 34:03.193
I'm Boorchu.

34:03.235 --> 34:05.153
Why are you helping me?

34:05.195 --> 34:07.072
I know who you are.

34:07.113 --> 34:10.659
Take my horse.

34:13.453 --> 34:18.458
I won't forget you, Boorchu.

34:44.150 --> 34:50.824
Great Tengri watched over me
and I survived.

34:50.907 --> 34:59.249
I was ready to face my enemies
and take back what was mine.

35:00.750 --> 35:07.090
But first I had
to find my bride, Borte.

35:17.225 --> 35:20.228
I thought you were dead.

35:20.270 --> 35:22.147
I'm not.

35:22.189 --> 35:25.317
You know why I came.

35:25.358 --> 35:29.196
You chose her years ago.

35:29.237 --> 35:35.619
I don't know...
if Borte still wants you.

35:50.383 --> 35:54.763
My Temudgin came back.

35:54.888 --> 35:56.431
Father...

35:56.473 --> 36:01.811
...I have to go with Temudgin.

36:04.272 --> 36:09.277
Bring the sable coat. Quick!

36:10.000 --> 36:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:45.730 --> 36:50.151
Don't you want to touch me, Temudgin?

36:50.193 --> 36:55.615
My touch will break you in two.

37:06.543 --> 37:10.630
My son... Temudgin.

37:22.142 --> 37:25.353
I like you.

37:26.605 --> 37:31.109
You're strong, like me.

37:32.235 --> 37:35.697
You're good.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.290
This is my dowry. Take it.

37:45.332 --> 37:48.460
For me...

37:49.669 --> 37:53.340
It's too much.

38:01.723 --> 38:05.560
This is for you.

38:22.702 --> 38:26.373
Brother, when will you
put up your yurt?

38:26.414 --> 38:28.083
Tomorrow.

38:28.124 --> 38:31.962
It's good to have our brother back.

38:32.003 --> 38:37.300
And with such a beautiful wife.

39:01.700 --> 39:03.410
I caught you.

39:03.451 --> 39:07.956
0nly because I let you.

39:08.331 --> 39:10.500
I'll make a good wife.

39:10.542 --> 39:13.336
I know.

39:20.719 --> 39:23.221
Stay here!

39:23.263 --> 39:25.974
0elun!

39:30.353 --> 39:31.938
0elun!

39:31.980 --> 39:34.399
0elun!

39:34.441 --> 39:37.110
Chiledu?

39:37.152 --> 39:40.530
You remember my voice?

39:40.572 --> 39:43.533
A woman never forgets
her first husband!

39:43.575 --> 39:48.246
Get down! I want to see your face.

39:48.288 --> 39:52.000
Why should I look at you, old woman?

39:52.042 --> 39:54.669
I want Temudgin's bride!

39:54.711 --> 39:58.006
Get out of here! Leave us alone!

39:58.048 --> 40:01.009
They're not here! Go!

40:01.051 --> 40:03.970
Shut up!

40:21.196 --> 40:25.158
Khasar, watch out!

40:28.495 --> 40:32.874
Where are they? Speak!

40:32.958 --> 40:36.002
I found their tracks.

40:36.044 --> 40:39.172
Let's go!

40:45.178 --> 40:51.017
Temudgin, I waited so long for you.

40:51.101 --> 40:52.727
I rubbed this wishbone so many times.

40:52.769 --> 40:55.689
I had only one wish:

40:55.730 --> 41:00.527
That you would come back.

41:01.570 --> 41:06.825
I always want to be with you, Temudgin.

41:06.867 --> 41:09.995
I promise.

41:16.877 --> 41:19.796
Merkits.

43:02.858 --> 43:05.861
Go home!

43:53.700 --> 43:59.956
When Temudgin's father
stole my bride...

44:00.665 --> 44:03.084
...I swore revenge.

44:03.126 --> 44:06.129
You're mine now.

44:06.171 --> 44:09.216
Take her!

44:21.770 --> 44:24.564
My son.

44:25.774 --> 44:28.985
My brother.

44:34.574 --> 44:39.246
What did they do to you?

45:04.437 --> 45:10.068
How are you, Jamukha, my brother!

45:15.782 --> 45:20.453
I'm glad you're alive, brother.

45:20.495 --> 45:25.083
Accept my gift, brother.

45:45.770 --> 45:52.527
When I heard that the Merkits
had stolen your wife...

45:52.569 --> 45:56.698
...my liver began to ache.

45:56.740 --> 46:01.244
I want to talk to you.

46:05.499 --> 46:09.211
Mongols don't make war over a woman.

46:09.252 --> 46:17.260
I'll tell Taichar now
and he'll bring you two new wives.

46:18.428 --> 46:22.390
I want Borte back.

46:24.518 --> 46:31.191
Temudgin, have you
never tried another one?

46:31.691 --> 46:39.074
And you think she's the only one
with strong legs?

46:40.033 --> 46:43.870
My time is short.

46:55.549 --> 46:58.885
Say welcome.

47:02.597 --> 47:05.392
Taichar...

47:05.433 --> 47:11.273
...Merkits have offended my brother.

47:20.949 --> 47:23.827
How many warriors can you bring?

47:23.869 --> 47:28.415
I have my sword and some people.

47:28.456 --> 47:31.293
That's not enough, brother.

47:31.334 --> 47:36.131
That's why I came to you.

48:02.908 --> 48:06.244
I'll do it.

48:08.330 --> 48:10.832
Next year.

48:10.874 --> 48:14.711
That's too late.

48:16.296 --> 48:19.799
Next year's better.

48:19.841 --> 48:22.761
We wait.

48:29.601 --> 48:36.566
Don't tell anyone we went to war
over a woman.

48:55.126 --> 48:59.798
This is Merkit territory.

52:07.110 --> 52:11.489
Who the hell are you?

53:23.979 --> 53:29.192
I knew you would come for me.

53:31.611 --> 53:37.325
Borte, I can't stay away from you.

53:49.045 --> 53:52.716
This is my son.

54:04.769 --> 54:07.480
I see.

54:52.192 --> 54:58.240
Are you happy
to have your wife back?

55:00.909 --> 55:06.665
I wouldn't sleep with such a woman.

55:10.460 --> 55:13.922
You're brave.

55:16.466 --> 55:19.678
Very brave!

55:31.648 --> 55:34.484
I want to thank you, brother.

55:34.526 --> 55:39.114
You'll stay with me now.

55:39.322 --> 55:44.870
I'm used to being my own master.

55:46.413 --> 55:51.835
You don't know Mongols.
You won't survive on your own.

55:51.877 --> 55:57.174
You'll be my second-in-command.

55:58.633 --> 56:02.554
Temudgin, your people are waiting.

56:02.596 --> 56:06.975
- I have to go.
- Go.

56:17.194 --> 56:23.867
Temudgin, I grabbed
the best sword for you.

56:24.159 --> 56:26.369
Jamukha took most of the plunder.

56:26.411 --> 56:32.167
Tell us how to divide what's left.

56:34.836 --> 56:36.505
I'll take a tenth portion.

56:36.546 --> 56:39.424
Divide the rest between the warriors.

56:39.466 --> 56:44.095
Don't forget the families
of the warriors who died.

56:44.137 --> 56:50.602
- This is for you.
- Thank you, Temudgin.

56:50.936 --> 56:57.817
Listen, everyone!
Temudgin is generous to us!

57:00.737 --> 57:05.534
Everyone gets their share!

57:09.663 --> 57:16.253
Look at him!
He gave away all his plunder.

57:16.753 --> 57:18.338
Next time he'll take it all.

57:18.380 --> 57:23.218
He's taking
a Merkit child into his yurt.

57:23.260 --> 57:25.136
Don't speak ill of my brother.

57:25.178 --> 57:31.935
What brother is he to you?
I'm your brother!

58:56.811 --> 59:01.066
You can't cook
two ram heads in one pot...

59:01.107 --> 59:04.444
...Temudgin.

59:10.534 --> 59:13.453
Wake up!

59:23.296 --> 59:28.927
My brother left me. He's stubborn!

59:36.101 --> 59:38.895
Get up!

59:40.981 --> 59:44.651
Daritai!
Altan!

59:49.781 --> 59:52.701
Daritai!

59:55.412 --> 59:58.331
Taichar!

59:59.207 --> 01:00:03.753
Where is Daritai?
Where is Altan?

01:00:03.795 --> 01:00:09.426
They should be close to my boots.

01:00:10.093 --> 01:00:14.514
They left with Temudgin.

01:00:14.556 --> 01:00:17.142
What?

01:00:18.143 --> 01:00:22.731
They left with Temudgin.

01:00:53.386 --> 01:00:59.184
Brother! You didn't say goodbye to me.

01:00:59.226 --> 01:01:04.231
You were sleeping, brother.

01:01:05.774 --> 01:01:11.363
My people are with you now.
Why, brother?

01:01:11.404 --> 01:01:18.578
Mongols can change their
master if they wish to.

01:01:21.414 --> 01:01:25.043
Daritai, Altan!

01:01:26.002 --> 01:01:29.339
Why have you deserted me?

01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:33.009
Temudgin is fair to his warriors.

01:01:33.051 --> 01:01:34.386
Give us back our horses!

01:01:34.427 --> 01:01:40.475
You gave me this horse, so it's mine.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.814
Daritai, I'm the law.

01:01:46.189 --> 01:01:49.651
I'll tear your rotting liver out.

01:01:49.693 --> 01:01:52.195
Try!

01:01:52.279 --> 01:01:57.492
My liver has a new master now.

01:02:10.255 --> 01:02:13.091
I can't send them back to you, brother.

01:02:13.133 --> 01:02:18.763
Mongols have the right to choose.

01:02:41.244 --> 01:02:47.083
Look after our horse. I'll be back!

01:02:55.258 --> 01:03:02.349
Daritai!
Thieves are stealing Temudgin's horses!

01:03:51.064 --> 01:03:57.362
Jamukha's people tried
to steal your horses.

01:03:57.404 --> 01:04:01.908
We killed one of them.

01:04:09.249 --> 01:04:12.752
We killed Jamukha's brother.

01:04:12.794 --> 01:04:15.714
Taichar.

01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:19.593
Who killed him?

01:04:20.135 --> 01:04:24.723
I did. I didn't recognize him.

01:04:24.764 --> 01:04:31.271
You saved the horses,
but you brought us war.

01:04:31.313 --> 01:04:37.903
Forgive me, lord.
Send my head to Jamukha.

01:04:48.496 --> 01:04:52.042
He guarded your herd well.

01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:58.757
If you hand him over,
what will people say?

01:05:31.081 --> 01:05:36.920
I've heard of your sorrow, Jamukha.

01:05:45.595 --> 01:05:50.475
I'll help you get revenge.

01:05:58.275 --> 01:06:02.863
I want to tie Temudgin's head
to the tail of my horse.

01:06:02.904 --> 01:06:05.699
Do it.

01:06:10.787 --> 01:06:15.083
Without you, I can't.

01:06:23.216 --> 01:06:28.013
Are you afraid, Targutai?

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:36.730
What kind of Khan are you?

01:06:36.771 --> 01:06:42.485
There are only two strong Mongols
in the steppe.

01:06:42.527 --> 01:06:47.407
Me and my brother Temudgin.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.912
Understand?

01:06:52.579 --> 01:06:59.377
I'll bring all my horsemen.
Give me Temudgin!

01:07:47.217 --> 01:07:51.471
Temudgin,
Jamukha is following your tracks.

01:07:51.513 --> 01:07:56.601
- There will be 10 of them for each of us.
- Tell us what to do.

01:07:56.643 --> 01:07:58.395
I will not abandon our families.

01:07:58.436 --> 01:08:07.112
If we survive we'll get back for them.
We haven't any other choice.

01:08:07.153 --> 01:08:10.240
Altan, Daritai.
You trusted me with your families.

01:08:10.282 --> 01:08:19.040
Jamukha will show them no mercy.
Are you ready to abandon them?

01:08:19.541 --> 01:08:23.920
You decide, Temudgin.

01:08:24.296 --> 01:08:26.881
Temudgin.

01:08:26.923 --> 01:08:31.511
Leave us. Save yourself!

01:08:33.305 --> 01:08:37.600
Do what Mongols
always do.

01:08:37.642 --> 01:08:39.269
Everyone will understand.

01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:42.229
Not me.

01:08:51.281 --> 01:08:56.286
Go to the mountains, quick!

01:09:03.877 --> 01:09:08.089
Let's move, Jamukha!
What are you waiting for?

01:09:08.131 --> 01:09:11.218
What's the rush, Targutai?

01:09:11.259 --> 01:09:18.058
Temudgin will run away.
We'll never find him!

01:09:19.643 --> 01:09:24.523
You don't know my brother.

01:09:44.667 --> 01:09:50.506
- Are you ready?
- Ready, Temudgin.

01:09:59.307 --> 01:10:02.102
Khasar!

01:10:02.602 --> 01:10:08.942
Take enough men
to protect our families!

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:42.267 --> 01:10:47.814
Temudgin, we're staying with you.

01:11:04.122 --> 01:11:07.959
It's time to go.

01:11:08.043 --> 01:11:11.171
Look after yourself and our son.

01:11:11.213 --> 01:11:15.509
Stay alive, Temudgin.

01:11:28.313 --> 01:11:32.067
Don't forget us.

01:12:37.132 --> 01:12:40.427
You see how smart my brother is?

01:12:40.468 --> 01:12:45.682
It won't be easy to take him.

01:12:58.403 --> 01:13:01.239
Attack!

01:14:54.477 --> 01:14:58.857
I want Temudgin alive!

01:14:59.107 --> 01:15:02.027
Me too!

01:15:57.207 --> 01:16:01.586
You promised, he's mine!

01:16:01.628 --> 01:16:09.553
Everything here is mine, Targutai.
And you're mine too.

01:16:39.791 --> 01:16:43.628
You say nothing.

01:16:48.049 --> 01:16:52.929
At least beg me for mercy.

01:16:53.555 --> 01:16:58.435
You want to die, Temudgin?

01:17:03.607 --> 01:17:08.486
I'm not a beggar, brother.

01:17:12.157 --> 01:17:16.536
Beg me for your life.

01:17:18.121 --> 01:17:21.041
I can't.

01:17:24.628 --> 01:17:28.298
I'm asking you.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.846
Forgive me brother!

01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:41.394
I am not your brother.

01:17:42.187 --> 01:17:45.732
I'm your Khan.

01:17:51.029 --> 01:17:55.408
And you are my slave.

01:17:57.452 --> 01:18:00.455
Take him!

01:18:30.277 --> 01:18:33.196
Hold on!

01:18:37.742 --> 01:18:41.371
I can't go on.

01:18:42.289 --> 01:18:47.502
Forgive me, I lost the battle.

01:18:47.794 --> 01:18:51.673
You fought well.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:56.136
You saved our families.

01:18:56.178 --> 01:19:02.225
Now Mongols know your name,
Temudgin.

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:30.295
Get up!

01:19:32.964 --> 01:19:36.092
Go! Push!

01:19:37.093 --> 01:19:40.722
I'm finished...

01:20:20.679 --> 01:20:23.515
How are you, Garrison Chief?

01:20:23.557 --> 01:20:26.768
Stop here.

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:29.729
Want to buy slaves?

01:20:29.771 --> 01:20:32.399
How much?

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.734
0ne rope of Tangut money.

01:20:34.776 --> 01:20:38.613
That one is two.

01:20:45.704 --> 01:20:49.166
And that one... five ropes!

01:20:49.207 --> 01:20:52.919
Too high. Three.

01:20:52.961 --> 01:20:59.593
I can't go lower.
This one killed my best guard.

01:20:59.634 --> 01:21:02.762
Don't buy that one.
He will bring sorrow upon us.

01:21:02.804 --> 01:21:10.103
What sorrow can a slave bring?
We have thousands of them.

01:21:10.145 --> 01:21:14.232
He'll never forgive the humiliation.
Let him go.

01:21:14.274 --> 01:21:16.902
Foolish talk, old monk.

01:21:16.943 --> 01:21:22.699
He's a slave, and he'll die a slave.

01:21:22.741 --> 01:21:25.869
I see hordes of Mongol horsemen...

01:21:25.911 --> 01:21:31.249
...ravaging your land, death...

01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:42.469
Hey, Mongol!
You want to destroy my kingdom?

01:21:49.017 --> 01:21:54.022
I know what to do with him.

01:22:30.517 --> 01:22:35.730
I haven't been paid in months.

01:22:37.566 --> 01:22:42.654
Listen. Let's sell the beast!

01:22:44.364 --> 01:22:47.909
Who'd buy him?

01:23:14.603 --> 01:23:17.439
Hey, Mongol! Show us your teeth!

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:24.237
"M0NG0L WH0 WANTED
T0 DESTR0Y TANGUT KINGD0M"

01:23:46.468 --> 01:23:49.721
Forgive us!

01:23:59.397 --> 01:24:03.693
Mongols die in cages.

01:24:06.154 --> 01:24:09.282
I'm alive.

01:24:10.242 --> 01:24:13.537
Your spirit is strong.

01:24:13.578 --> 01:24:16.331
I am here to ask you...

01:24:16.373 --> 01:24:25.048
...when the terrible time comes,
do not destroy our monastery.

01:24:25.715 --> 01:24:29.094
Kill the guard tonight...

01:24:29.135 --> 01:24:33.306
...bring me the key.

01:24:34.266 --> 01:24:38.520
My faith does not allow me to kill.

01:24:38.562 --> 01:24:42.107
My faith does.

01:24:43.191 --> 01:24:50.657
The monastery has many sacred books.
They must be saved.

01:24:50.699 --> 01:24:54.160
I can't read.

01:24:58.498 --> 01:25:02.335
Go to the merchants
who trade with Mongols.

01:25:02.377 --> 01:25:08.341
Ask them to find Temudgin's clan
and give this bone to Borte.

01:25:08.383 --> 01:25:12.345
Remember... Borte.

01:25:19.102 --> 01:25:22.439
I'll do it.

01:25:25.692 --> 01:25:31.281
In Mongolia, everyone gets robbed.

01:25:31.323 --> 01:25:34.576
Among us merchants,
only Golden Earring goes there.

01:25:34.618 --> 01:25:37.370
But he's a thief himself.

01:25:37.412 --> 01:25:44.085
Nobody knows when he comes
or when he goes.

01:25:45.128 --> 01:25:50.342
Nobody can help you, old monk.

01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:40.118
Juchi. Juchi!

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.496
We must go.

01:29:07.122 --> 01:29:12.043
I know how to bury a monk.

01:29:17.883 --> 01:29:22.846
- What are you waiting for?
- A caravan.

01:29:22.888 --> 01:29:26.057
This is the last caravan...

01:29:26.099 --> 01:29:31.188
...and I won't be back soon.

01:29:38.403 --> 01:29:42.782
Take us with you now!

01:29:44.409 --> 01:29:51.374
It's a long road.
I can see you have no money.

01:29:56.588 --> 01:30:04.095
- How will you pay me?
- You know how I'll pay you.

01:32:58.728 --> 01:33:03.733
- It is not enough.
- We had a deal.

01:33:03.775 --> 01:33:12.450
- He wants more. 0r he'll tell on me.
- I haven't got anymore.

01:33:13.243 --> 01:33:18.874
You don't look like a poor woman.

01:33:21.835 --> 01:33:24.963
Hey, wait!

01:33:25.589 --> 01:33:28.717
I want to talk.

01:33:28.758 --> 01:33:33.263
Don't try to cross me!

01:33:34.472 --> 01:33:38.226
Give me the key.

01:34:59.599 --> 01:35:02.686
What's her name?

01:35:02.727 --> 01:35:05.564
Mongen.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:13.071
I am your father, Mongen.

01:35:17.242 --> 01:35:20.328
Where is my other father?

01:35:20.370 --> 01:35:26.209
Forget him. This is your father now.

01:36:46.122 --> 01:36:49.668
Go and sleep.

01:38:13.293 --> 01:38:18.423
Don't worry, he's our father.

01:39:30.287 --> 01:39:34.958
Do you want to play too?

01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:48.680
Father. Why don't you braid your hair?

01:39:48.722 --> 01:39:53.101
Shouldn't a man always braid his hair?

01:39:53.143 --> 01:39:56.062
Not me.

01:40:09.743 --> 01:40:14.748
- We call this meat.
- Meat.

01:40:24.132 --> 01:40:29.763
Someday,
everyone will understand Mongol.

01:40:29.804 --> 01:40:36.144
Listen to how beautiful it sounds:
Meat!

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.606
Meat!

01:40:49.616 --> 01:40:53.995
- Jochi, how old are you?
- Ten, Father.

01:40:54.037 --> 01:40:59.125
You must choose a bride soon.

01:40:59.167 --> 01:41:01.753
How do I choose?

01:41:01.795 --> 01:41:07.425
I will teach you because finding
a good woman is the hardest thing.

01:41:07.467 --> 01:41:10.387
I agree.

01:41:13.932 --> 01:41:23.859
- I told you not to be scared.
- I'm not scared. 0ur father is very funny.

01:41:28.530 --> 01:41:35.203
I have names for the sons
you will bear me.

01:41:35.328 --> 01:41:39.958
Don't you know what Mongols are like?

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.045
I'm Mongol. I know.

01:41:45.505 --> 01:41:49.551
They are worse than ever.
All they do is kill and steal.

01:41:49.593 --> 01:41:55.348
They don't even spare the children.

01:42:05.483 --> 01:42:10.906
I know what to do with Mongols.

01:42:17.537 --> 01:42:22.876
Take the children and go home.

01:42:29.466 --> 01:42:35.931
When will you be back?
A year? Two years?

01:42:43.688 --> 01:42:49.110
I won't see you soon, Temudgin.

01:43:24.312 --> 01:43:30.110
Lord of the Blue Sky, Great Tengri!
I bow before you.

01:43:30.151 --> 01:43:34.447
Give me the strength.

01:43:55.802 --> 01:44:00.974
Mongols need laws.
I will make them obey...

01:44:01.016 --> 01:44:07.272
...even if I have to kill half of them.

01:44:19.576 --> 01:44:27.125
0ur laws will be simple.
Don't kill women or children.

01:44:27.167 --> 01:44:31.755
Don't forget your debts.

01:44:33.256 --> 01:44:37.844
Fight enemies to the end.

01:44:37.886 --> 01:44:42.766
And never betray your Khan.

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:09.876
Many warriors came under my banner.

01:45:11.253 --> 01:45:19.469
They knew I wanted to unite
all Mongols to make us strong.

01:45:25.559 --> 01:45:31.398
But Jamukha tried to tear us apart.

01:45:31.731 --> 01:45:41.116
The time came for our final battle
to decide who would rule Mongolia.

01:45:51.251 --> 01:45:54.462
Jamukha's army was bigger.

01:45:54.504 --> 01:46:01.178
But I had my strategy
and I knew how to win

01:46:04.222 --> 01:46:09.060
I still needed Tengri...
Lord of the Blue Sky...

01:46:09.102 --> 01:46:13.398
...to be on my side.

01:46:34.961 --> 01:46:40.592
My brother's warriors shoot well.

01:46:42.802 --> 01:46:47.182
Let's attack, Jamukha!

01:46:49.392 --> 01:46:54.689
My brother is crafty as a wolf.

01:47:03.406 --> 01:47:07.244
First detachment.

01:51:40.517 --> 01:51:43.353
Attack!

01:52:14.009 --> 01:52:16.511
Go!

01:54:31.688 --> 01:54:35.817
Temudgin!
We throw our Khan at your feet.

01:54:35.859 --> 01:54:39.738
He tried to run, but we killed him.

01:54:39.779 --> 01:54:45.952
- Who is this?
- Your enemy, Targutai.

01:54:54.127 --> 01:54:58.798
- Kill them!
- For what?

01:55:00.967 --> 01:55:05.263
Altan! What did we do wrong?

01:55:05.305 --> 01:55:11.603
You broke the law.
You betrayed your Khan!

01:55:11.645 --> 01:55:15.482
We didn't know...

01:55:22.697 --> 01:55:25.825
How are you, old man?

01:55:25.867 --> 01:55:32.332
Thank you for remembering,
Khan Temudgin.

01:55:35.961 --> 01:55:44.177
Give him one hundred horses
and put his yurt next to mine.

01:55:46.596 --> 01:55:51.935
Take all these men into my army.

01:55:51.977 --> 01:55:56.565
Temudgin. We caught him.

01:56:14.207 --> 01:56:17.210
Temudgin.

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:25.051
Now you're Khan and I'm at your feet.
Are you happy?

01:56:32.726 --> 01:56:39.316
- I forgive you, brother.
- It's too late.

01:56:41.776 --> 01:56:47.616
I'll always be a rock in your boot.

01:56:53.288 --> 01:57:00.712
I want to ask you:
All Mongols fear the thunder...

01:57:01.254 --> 01:57:05.008
...but not you?

01:57:06.092 --> 01:57:12.140
I had no place to hide
from the thunder...

01:57:12.182 --> 01:57:17.521
...so I wasn't afraid anymore.

01:57:25.946 --> 01:57:32.619
What are you going to do with me,
Temudgin?

01:57:33.036 --> 01:57:37.082
What would you do?

01:57:39.793 --> 01:57:44.589
I would kill you, brother.

01:58:00.897 --> 01:58:03.400
Go!

01:58:13.201 --> 01:58:18.415
You're letting your enemy go.

01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:23.920
I'm letting my brother go.

01:58:31.678 --> 01:58:34.431
Father!

01:58:34.472 --> 01:58:40.770
When will we go to choose my bride?
You must keep your promise.

01:58:40.812 --> 01:58:44.482
We'll go soon.

01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:59.956
See how well I chose your mother.

01:58:59.998 --> 01:59:04.377
Temudgin, I chose you.

01:59:10.717 --> 01:59:13.303
True!

01:59:36.618 --> 01:59:42.123
I have to finish what I started.

01:59:50.757 --> 01:59:55.637
You're a good wife, Borte.

02:00:06.565 --> 02:00:11.987
You know I'll always come back.

02:00:29.671 --> 02:00:33.425
Don't be afraid.

02:00:46.897 --> 02:00:52.527
You know your future, Great Khan.

02:01:01.077 --> 02:01:08.376
Temujin was acknowledged
as ruler of all Mongols.

02:01:18.887 --> 02:01:24.559
The Tungus Kingdom was erased
from the face of the earth.

02:01:24.601 --> 02:01:30.023
But the monastery was preserved.
