00:04.969 --> 00:07.129
[Gasping]

00:09.280 --> 00:13.584
I should never have let her
move into that apartment.

00:13.585 --> 00:19.485
I started to think that almost every corner
of this house held some kind of secret.

00:21.126 --> 00:23.706
The fear was...

00:24.161 --> 00:27.221
Just eating me alive.

00:28.066 --> 00:31.001
[Ominous piano music]

00:31.002 --> 00:32.136
[Woman sobbing]

00:32.137 --> 00:34.205
The sound of a woman crying...

00:34.206 --> 00:35.773
You're hurting me!

00:35.774 --> 00:39.110
A woman void of all hope.

00:39.111 --> 00:41.212
[Rope strains]

00:41.213 --> 00:44.782
Cast into hell Satan and all evil spirits!

00:44.783 --> 00:46.350
Cast them into hell!

00:46.351 --> 00:47.584
[Crashing and banging]

00:47.585 --> 00:48.719
[Woman sobbing]

00:48.720 --> 00:49.521
[Sobs]

00:49.522 --> 00:51.355
Stop!

00:51.356 --> 00:56.876
There were thousands and
thousands of pictures of women.

01:01.363 --> 01:05.983
I always felt like there were others there.

01:21.352 --> 01:24.472
[Acoustic guitar music]

01:49.878 --> 01:54.576
It was July of 1970, and Marsha and
I had been married three years.

01:54.577 --> 01:58.193
And we were happily gonna
have our first child.

01:58.194 --> 02:01.432
We were joyous, excited.

02:01.433 --> 02:05.335
We were just... we were on a cloud.

02:05.336 --> 02:07.554
And we thought nothing could go wrong.

02:07.555 --> 02:09.771
Life was exactly the way it should be.

02:09.773 --> 02:11.426
[Door closes]

02:11.427 --> 02:14.607
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Ed.

02:16.212 --> 02:18.046
[Groans]

02:18.047 --> 02:19.147
What's the matter?

02:19.148 --> 02:21.139
I went to pay the rent to my landlady.

02:21.140 --> 02:23.952
And happily announced that
we were gonna have a baby.

02:23.953 --> 02:25.244
You'll never believe it.

02:25.245 --> 02:28.704
And she sternly looked at me and
said, no children. No pets.

02:28.705 --> 02:30.050
No children. No pets.

02:30.051 --> 02:32.227
She wants us out.

02:32.228 --> 02:34.032
What?

02:34.033 --> 02:36.363
There was only about two
months before the baby.

02:36.364 --> 02:39.964
So there was a real urgency.

02:43.473 --> 02:47.073
I desperately started looking.

02:48.357 --> 02:54.049
About a month later, an ad popped
out that said, heir estate.

02:54.050 --> 02:58.010
So I took off to the inner city.

03:03.527 --> 03:05.661
It was a two-flat building...

03:05.662 --> 03:09.442
One living area on the first floor
and one living area above it.

03:09.443 --> 03:12.234
Mr. Becker, I'm Dave. Nice to see you.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.836
This is the place we're talking about.

03:13.837 --> 03:16.104
Would you like to have a look inside?

03:16.105 --> 03:19.345
- Sure.
- Let's do it.

03:25.415 --> 03:28.655
So this is the hallway.

03:29.686 --> 03:30.720
[Door clicks open]

03:30.721 --> 03:32.438
You sons of bitches!

03:32.439 --> 03:35.021
Get out of our home.
We don't want you here.

03:35.022 --> 03:36.540
You don't belong here.

03:36.541 --> 03:40.032
She just came out screaming
hysterically and swearing obscenities.

03:40.033 --> 03:42.437
You sons of bitches.

03:42.438 --> 03:44.433
We don't want you here.

03:44.434 --> 03:45.774
You have no right.

03:45.775 --> 03:48.570
We own this building.
You'll never own this building.

03:48.571 --> 03:50.004
- Myra...
- Get out!

03:50.005 --> 03:54.529
You can't have our house!
You'll never have our house.

03:54.530 --> 03:56.870
It's ours.

03:59.516 --> 04:00.912
Who was that?

04:00.913 --> 04:04.019
That's Myra. Pay no attention to her.

04:04.020 --> 04:06.522
Her family is gonna have her put in a home.

04:06.523 --> 04:10.650
He said, well, she's the last remaining
member of the family that owned,

04:10.651 --> 04:15.751
built, occupied this building
since, uh, beginning.

04:18.935 --> 04:21.995
Sorry about the mess.

04:24.073 --> 04:25.608
Have a look around.

04:25.609 --> 04:30.229
Take as much time as you need, Mr. Becker.

04:32.205 --> 04:37.665
My first impression was that
vandalism had taken place.

04:39.190 --> 04:42.682
What I saw was paper, rubbish, clothes,

04:42.683 --> 04:48.023
utensils scattered in all
directions around the floor.

04:52.401 --> 04:54.466
It needs a lot of work.

04:54.467 --> 04:57.640
But it does have great potential.

04:57.641 --> 05:01.196
He was selling me, and I was buying
it because I needed to buy it.

05:01.197 --> 05:03.200
I needed to have a roof over my head.

05:03.201 --> 05:07.783
I needed to have somewhere to
take my wife and my child.

05:07.784 --> 05:10.384
Have you seen enough?

05:10.385 --> 05:13.385
Can I see the rest?

05:16.301 --> 05:19.481
Let's do this quickly.

05:25.368 --> 05:28.070
She looked at me straight in the eyes.

05:28.071 --> 05:32.448
And I thought, there's no way I'm
taking possession of the building.

05:32.449 --> 05:35.629
With this woman inside.

05:36.508 --> 05:39.782
But he assured me.
He said, don't worry about her.

05:39.783 --> 05:44.703
Myra would be gone on
the day of the closing.

05:46.686 --> 05:49.218
I figured we'd rent the
first-level apartment.

05:49.219 --> 05:52.661
It would help us pay the mortgage,
and then we could live upstairs.

05:52.662 --> 05:54.244
I'll take it.

05:54.245 --> 05:57.833
I was relieved. I was happy.
I was gonna own something.

05:57.834 --> 06:02.507
It was gonna be ours.
We were gonna make a home there.

06:02.508 --> 06:04.507
There you go, buddy.

06:04.508 --> 06:06.247
Thanks.

06:06.248 --> 06:09.177
The bedroom on the left. Thanks.

06:09.178 --> 06:11.118
- How are you doing?
- Good.

06:11.119 --> 06:13.482
This is so exciting.

06:13.483 --> 06:16.952
The day we moved in, I felt
like we finally had a home.

06:16.953 --> 06:19.886
We had a little baby and
named her Christine.

06:19.887 --> 06:24.104
- Want to go inside?
- And I was happy.

06:24.105 --> 06:27.165
The pressure was off.

06:37.801 --> 06:40.676
In the first few days, I was so busy.

06:40.677 --> 06:42.711
There was not time to think.

06:42.712 --> 06:48.472
I was cleaning, still unpacking,
just setting up the house.

06:49.318 --> 06:52.931
My pride and joy was this
beautiful candy dish.

06:52.932 --> 06:56.487
One of the few really nice
wedding presents we got.

06:56.488 --> 07:01.588
I'd always leave it in
the middle of the table.

07:07.762 --> 07:13.662
All of a sudden, the candy dish was
on the other side of the table.

07:13.694 --> 07:18.074
I don't even know how to explain that.

07:22.385 --> 07:24.687
We hadn't been living there very long.

07:24.688 --> 07:27.748
We're home at night.

07:34.130 --> 07:35.963
What's wrong, Ed?

07:35.964 --> 07:39.744
It's probably just the circuit.

07:43.753 --> 07:46.438
It was almost in rhythm.

07:46.439 --> 07:51.209
The flashing had a rhythm,
almost like morse code.

07:51.210 --> 07:52.481
Fast flashes...

07:52.482 --> 07:54.153
[Fluttering]

07:54.154 --> 07:57.094
And then one flash.

08:00.857 --> 08:03.659
I don't like it, Ed.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.000
It's okay.

08:11.910 --> 08:13.770
See?

08:30.920 --> 08:35.626
It was after a month or so, and I'd
get up at 5:00 in the morning.

08:35.626 --> 08:38.386
And off to work.

08:42.532 --> 08:43.962
Of course, the first thing you want to do.

08:43.964 --> 08:45.781
Once, you know, I got a
break and I was able to...

08:45.782 --> 08:51.682
Is get to the telephone, call
Marsha, and say, how's it going?

08:51.994 --> 08:54.514
[Line beeping]

08:54.830 --> 08:56.712
The phone's busy.

08:56.713 --> 09:02.233
I figured, well, she's probably
calling family, friends.

09:06.123 --> 09:07.672
A few hours later, I call again.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.222

09:09.223 --> 09:10.473

09:26.843 --> 09:28.744
All day, I never got through,
and now I'm burning.

09:28.745 --> 09:33.215
It's like, you know, what
the heck is wrong with her?

09:33.216 --> 09:37.619
Who the hell... I couldn't even think
of who she could talk to all day long.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.480
Hey.

09:39.916 --> 09:43.216
Hey, honey. How are you?

09:43.659 --> 09:46.995
I got home, and I said...
I've been trying to call you all day.

09:46.996 --> 09:48.330
Who have you been talking to?

09:48.331 --> 09:51.037
She looked at me, and she was
just totally bewildered.

09:51.038 --> 09:52.878
And I said, who would I call?

09:52.879 --> 09:55.110
I don't know anyone here.

09:55.111 --> 09:57.348
Marsha, I've been calling all day.

09:57.349 --> 10:00.289
It's busy all day.

10:07.686 --> 10:10.442
The phone was on the table.

10:10.443 --> 10:15.124
But the cord and the receiver
earpiece was on the floor.

10:15.125 --> 10:18.425
It's been off the hook.

10:19.146 --> 10:21.764
All day and you didn't notice it?

10:21.765 --> 10:24.633
I didn't understand why
he was upset with me.

10:24.634 --> 10:26.668
I didn't take the telephone off the hook.

10:26.669 --> 10:30.749
He should know me better than that.

10:40.349 --> 10:43.334
I was busy with the baby.

10:43.335 --> 10:49.235
Being a new mom's a whole lot harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

[Clattering, soft ringing]

10:54.130 --> 10:55.547
[Dial tone humming]

10:55.548 --> 10:59.121
I didn't understand what was going on.

10:59.122 --> 11:02.437
But I knew something was wrong.

11:02.438 --> 11:05.738
Something was very wrong.

11:15.785 --> 11:18.276
Every morning, I was in the habit of,

11:18.277 --> 11:23.437
washing the breakfast dishes
and putting them away.

11:32.303 --> 11:34.177
And I turned around...

11:34.178 --> 11:37.598
The cabinet door was open.

[Gasping]

12:04.429 --> 12:06.802
It scared me to death.

12:06.803 --> 12:09.704
And it felt dangerous...

12:09.705 --> 12:12.705
Very, very dangerous.

12:30.897 --> 12:34.037
The first people to respond
were Dan and Diane White.

12:34.038 --> 12:37.014
So we live on the second floor.

12:37.015 --> 12:41.215
But I'll show you the kitchen first.

12:43.046 --> 12:44.826
This is my wife, Marsha.

12:44.827 --> 12:46.061
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Diane.

12:46.062 --> 12:48.063
There were about our age.

12:48.064 --> 12:50.966
Brand-new baby the same age as Christine.

12:50.967 --> 12:53.935
- Who is this?
- This is my little one.

12:53.936 --> 12:55.422
Oh, so sweet.

12:55.423 --> 12:57.880
I was very excited about the apartment.

12:57.881 --> 13:02.062
I could see that Diane was
really thinking of it as home.

13:02.063 --> 13:03.463
Hi, baby.

13:03.464 --> 13:07.000
I just felt connected to
Diane almost immediately.

13:07.001 --> 13:12.901
She was sweet and smiling, and she
had a kind look about her eyes.

13:13.025 --> 13:16.789
Diane and Marsha had very good chemistry.

13:16.790 --> 13:20.213
All I could think about
was, I won't be alone.

13:20.214 --> 13:22.404
She's gonna be downstairs.

13:22.405 --> 13:25.944
If I need help and I scream,
they're gonna hear.

13:25.945 --> 13:27.620
- Ed?
- Yeah?

13:27.621 --> 13:30.154
I'm gonna show Diane the living room, okay?

13:30.155 --> 13:32.154
- Okay.
- Right this way.

13:32.155 --> 13:34.327
We couldn't turn Diane and Dan away.

13:34.328 --> 13:36.162
They were perfect.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.791
We just called them the next day and said,

13:37.792 --> 13:42.772
you know, move in, you
guys, whenever you want.

13:45.072 --> 13:47.052
Diane?

13:47.616 --> 13:51.823
Soon after we moved into the apartment,
I would come home from work.

13:51.824 --> 13:54.764
Diane would be out.

13:56.634 --> 13:59.574
[Chandelier creaking]

14:00.128 --> 14:05.091
And I started seeing the chandelier
swinging back and forth...

Back and forth, back and forth.

14:07.495 --> 14:10.375
[Creaking continues]

14:12.133 --> 14:15.435
I didn't worry about it.

14:15.436 --> 14:20.296
I thought it was them
walking around upstairs.

14:29.529 --> 14:31.351
So this is what Dan's mom just got us.

14:31.352 --> 14:32.936
- It's a little jumper.
- So cute.

14:32.937 --> 14:35.821
One afternoon, I was downstairs
just talking to Diane.

14:35.822 --> 14:39.292
I'm surprised she has such good
taste, and I think it'll...

14:39.293 --> 14:43.396
Diane had put her baby into a walker.

14:43.397 --> 14:44.997
Her legs did not reach the floor.

14:44.998 --> 14:50.403
Baby was very tiny, very petite, not
crawling or walking or doing anything.

14:50.404 --> 14:52.864
[Eerie music]

15:06.437 --> 15:11.837
Out of the corner of my eye,
I see something moving.

15:20.834 --> 15:25.572
My mind didn't accept
that she was doing that.

15:25.573 --> 15:29.233
I knew she couldn't do that.

15:37.451 --> 15:39.791

[Baby crying]

15:58.972 --> 16:02.175
I felt it was my fault.

16:02.176 --> 16:07.036
I should have told her
the house was haunted.

16:10.901 --> 16:16.801
And when Ed came home from work, I
said, we need to talk about this.

16:16.802 --> 16:22.128
I know this sounds crazy, Ed,
but this house is haunted.

16:22.129 --> 16:24.664
Come on, Marsha. You're being paranoid.

16:24.665 --> 16:26.366
She got angry with me.

16:26.367 --> 16:30.267
She told me I didn't understand.

16:31.472 --> 16:36.309
She told me there was something in
the basement that wasn't right.

16:36.310 --> 16:39.010
[Stairs creaking]

16:49.151 --> 16:51.791
It was a cave.

16:55.669 --> 16:58.969
It was filled with junk.

17:07.273 --> 17:09.794
[Can clatters]

17:19.815 --> 17:23.234
I was examining everything.

17:24.300 --> 17:27.781
And what I saw was a jar.

17:36.699 --> 17:41.799
Inside of it were old
Monopoly pieces and things.

17:42.842 --> 17:46.802
But then I noticed something else.

17:50.871 --> 17:55.371
There were bullets in there, live bullets.

17:57.299 --> 18:01.209
It bothered me, because if someone
here in this house had bullets.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.296
There must have been a gun.

18:03.297 --> 18:09.197
If there was a gun, who had the gun?
And why would they have needed a gun?

18:20.486 --> 18:26.386
I looked to the back of the basement, and
there was a door that opened to a room...

18:35.709 --> 18:40.089
Filled floor to ceiling with shoe boxes.

18:40.646 --> 18:44.606
And the other side was magazines...

18:48.542 --> 18:53.780
Girlie magazines of early day,
going back to the '30s.

18:53.781 --> 18:59.681
The name Ben Verdere was written
almost on every magazine I picked up.

19:02.323 --> 19:08.023
I went to the shoe boxes, and
I started opening them up.

19:14.668 --> 19:19.138
It was the most amazing
thing that I had ever seen.

19:19.139 --> 19:23.279
There were little clippings of paper.

19:26.980 --> 19:31.780
Thousands and thousands
of pictures of women...

19:33.112 --> 19:36.871
Uh, maybe a tight sweater, maybe
a skirt blowing up in the air.

19:36.872 --> 19:42.772
He cut that picture out, and he
put it into these shoe boxes.

19:47.601 --> 19:53.361
I had a picture of this Ben
Verdere being quite perverted.

19:53.634 --> 19:56.154
And disturbed.

19:57.478 --> 19:58.978
He obviously treasured this.

19:58.979 --> 20:04.879
He obviously enjoyed looking at it, and
he probably pleasured himself in secret.

20:09.523 --> 20:12.555
I didn't want to tell Marsha about
what I found because I felt,

20:12.556 --> 20:15.261
this would definitely add to her fears.

20:15.262 --> 20:19.822
I just felt, nothing good can come of it.

20:21.067 --> 20:23.647
[Water running]

20:25.873 --> 20:27.756
Every morning, when I
put Christine down for

20:27.757 --> 20:29.932
her morning nap and Ed
had gone off to work.

20:29.933 --> 20:33.893
That was my time to get my bath.

21:00.941 --> 21:03.581
[Faint creaking]

21:12.085 --> 21:17.065
All of a sudden, I felt
a little uncomfortable.

21:20.107 --> 21:24.007
I just felt like I'm not alone.

21:25.499 --> 21:27.959

[Panting softly]

21:48.188 --> 21:51.428
There was nothing there.

22:00.634 --> 22:02.794
[Screams]

22:06.206 --> 22:09.266
I completely lost it.

22:12.546 --> 22:14.706
[Screams]

22:15.289 --> 22:19.184
Something has actually attacked me.

22:19.185 --> 22:22.725
It's touched me. [Screaming]

22:31.462 --> 22:33.463
[Screams]

22:33.464 --> 22:34.764
[Door slams]

22:34.765 --> 22:37.345
[Clock ticking]

22:41.963 --> 22:47.320
I didn't belong to the church, but
I just instinctively wondered...

22:47.321 --> 22:53.049
If some kindly old priest would
come over and fix my house.

22:53.050 --> 22:55.607
He would take the evil out.

22:55.608 --> 22:58.428
[Door clicks shut]

22:59.056 --> 23:01.290
Father, you know my wife, Marsha.

23:01.291 --> 23:03.565
- Hello, Marsha.
- Thank you for coming.

23:03.566 --> 23:05.526
She believed it would put
an umbrella of protection,

23:05.527 --> 23:08.531
over some of these things
that were going on.

23:08.532 --> 23:12.601
I just thought, this is a bunch of crap.

23:12.602 --> 23:15.602
I don't believe it.

23:30.097 --> 23:33.757
And he reached into his robe.

23:34.618 --> 23:40.518
And he pulled out this brass
dispenser, a holy water dispenser.

23:40.554 --> 23:43.734
And he started praying.

23:43.833 --> 23:47.973
Dear Lord, we pray to you, oh, God.

23:48.262 --> 23:50.573
For this home, its occupants...

23:50.574 --> 23:53.668
I looked to Marsha, and she was frightened.

23:53.669 --> 23:55.088
Like something was gonna happen.

23:55.089 --> 24:00.830
Heavenly due in good measure as well
as an abundance of earthly needs.

24:00.831 --> 24:03.848
He who dwells in the shelter...

24:03.849 --> 24:09.729
Of the most high who abides in
the shadow of the almighty...

24:12.127 --> 24:15.607
My refuge and my fortress...

24:16.365 --> 24:18.601
My God in whom I trust.

[Dispenser shatters] [Screams]

Poof.

24:23.039 --> 24:24.306
[Dispenser pieces clattering]

24:24.307 --> 24:26.742
It shattered.

24:26.743 --> 24:29.011
There's no way that can happen...

24:29.012 --> 24:30.713
Even I understand that.

24:30.714 --> 24:35.002
Brass does not shatter, and this shattered.

24:35.003 --> 24:37.285
Blessed Archangel Michael...

24:37.286 --> 24:39.021
This man was frightened.

24:39.022 --> 24:44.905
I mean, something had attacked him in
such a way that he recognized the danger.

24:44.906 --> 24:47.666
Protect us! Amen!

24:48.832 --> 24:51.266
[Door opens, closes]

24:51.267 --> 24:56.338
We had just seen a symbol of God
burst into midair... be destroyed.

24:56.339 --> 25:02.239
All of a sudden, I was starting to
acknowledge it and admit it and that...

25:02.835 --> 25:08.735
We were dealing with something that
was real, that I couldn't explain.

25:10.053 --> 25:13.170
Her non believing husband
all of a sudden said...

25:13.171 --> 25:18.571
Yeah, we're dealing with
something beyond our control.

25:20.743 --> 25:24.432
I decided, I'm gonna go investigate
the history of the house.

25:24.433 --> 25:29.204
And I figured if anybody could give me any
information, it'd be Walter, my neighbor.

25:29.205 --> 25:30.205
He said...

25:30.206 --> 25:36.106
I'm so sorry for you, that you moved
into that house with a young child.

25:38.915 --> 25:42.417
I had so many questions that were really,
you know, buzzing around my mind.

25:42.418 --> 25:46.141
I lived next to these people for 50 years.

25:46.142 --> 25:48.362
50 years.

25:48.558 --> 25:51.978
They were a very... [sighs]

25:52.042 --> 25:55.363
Very, very strange, very strange.

25:55.364 --> 25:58.734
He told me that the Verdere family
had built the house around 1900.

25:58.735 --> 26:04.439
It had never been occupied by
anybody other than family members.

26:04.440 --> 26:07.260
They never smiled.

26:07.643 --> 26:12.380
They never spoke to me, never
spoke to me or my wife.

26:12.381 --> 26:14.481
Nothing.

26:15.251 --> 26:16.551
Strange.

26:16.552 --> 26:21.976
He explained that the Verdere family
had three sons and a daughter.

26:21.977 --> 26:24.999
Ben was the second son.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.656
A daughter named Myra.

26:27.657 --> 26:31.221
And then a young son who died young.

26:31.222 --> 26:33.502
Now, Ben...

26:35.868 --> 26:39.386
He was the dominant man in the house.

26:39.387 --> 26:44.187
He controlled that house
and everybody in it.

26:51.054 --> 26:55.254
He was some piece of dirt, that man.

26:55.658 --> 26:58.424
Next, he told me that Ben Verdere...

26:58.425 --> 27:01.592
Had passed away in the
bathtub in our apartment.

27:01.593 --> 27:04.293
Massive coronary.

27:10.740 --> 27:14.342
Now, it... it became a revelation.

27:14.343 --> 27:17.946
I started to attribute...
whether I was correct or not...

27:17.947 --> 27:23.547
But I started to attribute all
my activity to Ben Verdere.

27:23.548 --> 27:25.613
I assumed that we were living with Ben.

[Crying]

27:46.475 --> 27:48.395
Stop!

27:48.711 --> 27:52.414
My first thought was that it
was Diane and Dan downstairs.

27:52.415 --> 27:53.782
I didn't know them that well.

27:53.783 --> 27:58.120
I figured all couples have arguments,
but this was too violent.

27:58.121 --> 28:01.623
Oh, my Lord, Ed. We got to do something.

28:01.624 --> 28:04.526
He's really hurting her.

28:04.527 --> 28:07.107
Just leave it.

28:07.396 --> 28:11.636
I couldn't understand that, because,
to me, they were a very loving couple.

28:11.637 --> 28:13.334
It's their business.

[Shouting and clattering]

29:13.296 --> 29:16.153

29:16.154 --> 29:19.094
It sounded terrible.

[Woman screaming]

29:25.041 --> 29:27.876

It stopped.

29:45.746 --> 29:48.866
There's nothing there.

29:56.472 --> 29:58.973
But once I knew it wasn't Dan and Diane,

29:58.974 --> 30:04.014
I realized that I had to
tell Marsha everything.

30:08.285 --> 30:14.165
I told Marsha about Ben and his
secret pornographic hideaway.

30:15.691 --> 30:17.731

30:17.760 --> 30:19.894
I told her about Ben's wife.

30:19.895 --> 30:22.895
Amelia, is that you?

30:27.907 --> 30:31.879
Walter had told me she
was of Spanish descent.

30:31.880 --> 30:35.643

to ever live in that house.

30:35.644 --> 30:37.894

32:09.003 --> 32:14.207

hearing the arguing on the stairs.

32:14.208 --> 32:18.108
The... the anguish and the crying.

32:20.349 --> 32:24.453
I realized that the ghost of this family...

32:24.454 --> 32:28.741
The Verdere family...
was occupying our house.

32:28.742 --> 32:33.722
It was built by them.
Some of them died there.

32:34.697 --> 32:38.597
The words of Myra began echoing...

32:38.598 --> 32:41.308
[Echoing] You'll never have our house!

32:41.309 --> 32:42.967
Never.

32:42.968 --> 32:44.870
Never!

32:44.871 --> 32:50.771

they weren't gonna give it up.

33:12.307 --> 33:16.657
I'd get up at 5:00 in the
morning and off to work.

Marsha was home all day with the baby.

[Baby crying]

33:25.958 --> 33:27.809
She was losing sleep.

33:27.810 --> 33:32.551
Her mood wasn't as upbeat
and jovial and smiling.

33:32.552 --> 33:36.452
Kind of, I thought, a depression.

33:39.117 --> 33:42.885
To me, it just seemed like a common thread.

33:42.886 --> 33:46.665
Of this family and of
their effect on people.

33:46.666 --> 33:50.026
Was driving people insane.

33:53.815 --> 33:57.084
Diane had always been a bubbly person.

33:57.085 --> 33:59.820
She would always be laughing.

33:59.821 --> 34:03.447
Now she looked like she was troubled.

34:03.448 --> 34:08.188
She wasn't her normal
outgoing self anymore.

34:14.926 --> 34:18.286
She would just sit there.

34:21.510 --> 34:24.512
I was constantly on the move.

34:24.513 --> 34:27.936
I would walk around the
apartment and check.

34:27.937 --> 34:31.074
Is this still there? Is that still okay?

34:31.076 --> 34:33.656
The fear was...

34:34.045 --> 34:37.106
Just eating me alive.

34:43.532 --> 34:47.920
Whatever she was experiencing
and not telling me.

34:47.920 --> 34:51.521
Was uh, ruining our marriage.

34:58.647 --> 35:02.359
I was starting to argue
with Diane about it and...

35:02.360 --> 35:06.560
She decided that she was gonna leave.

35:07.923 --> 35:11.523
She took our baby and moved.

35:18.533 --> 35:21.802
When Diane left, I was devastated.

35:21.803 --> 35:25.283
I really felt I had lost...

35:25.421 --> 35:29.921
The last of someone there that understood.

35:37.853 --> 35:42.473
I always felt like there were others there.

35:49.263 --> 35:53.968
Later that night, I came home, and
Marsha was in a serious mood.

35:53.969 --> 35:59.869
She sat down. She gave me dinner.
And she was being very quiet.

[Door creaks open]

- I got angry. I got up.

[Rattling]

36:33.241 --> 36:36.577
- Got a piece of heavy string.
- You're only gonna make it worse.

36:36.578 --> 36:41.649
I tied it around the doorknob, and I
said, now open the door, you pervert.

became manic and angry.

- And I was gonna torment him.

Leave us alone! This is not your house!

37:13.882 --> 37:16.717
- Ed, please!
- Come on, Ben, you old pervert.

37:16.718 --> 37:18.819
- Come on!
- Stop it!

37:18.820 --> 37:21.529
- Come on!
- Please, please!

37:21.530 --> 37:24.458
- This is our house.
- Stop, please, Ed!

37:24.459 --> 37:27.719
- Come on! Come on!
- Please! Please!

37:27.720 --> 37:30.960
Yeah, come on. Come on.

37:31.833 --> 37:37.733
Come on... you can't do it.
You can't do it, you old pervert.

37:51.686 --> 37:57.024
I felt in despair because
there was nothing I could do.

37:57.025 --> 38:00.234
I sat there, I cursed...

38:00.235 --> 38:02.963
Ben, I cursed the whole Verdere family.

38:02.964 --> 38:07.344
I felt that they were ruining our life.

38:12.118 --> 38:14.134
Marsha had had enough.

38:14.135 --> 38:17.354
And, she came to the conclusion
that we couldn't get out of it.

38:17.355 --> 38:19.334
We had no money to move.

38:19.335 --> 38:24.178
And I said, Eddie, there just
has to be somebody out there...

38:24.179 --> 38:26.386
That knows what they're doing.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.031
This is serious.

38:28.032 --> 38:33.932
So Marsha tried the yellow pages and found
a category called psychic research.

38:33.935 --> 38:35.295
Okay, yeah.

38:35.296 --> 38:38.666
Joseph Delouise is a psychic.
He talked to Ed.

38:38.667 --> 38:41.242
Church of England, okay.

38:41.243 --> 38:43.826
I'll have to talk to my wife.

38:43.827 --> 38:45.747
Yeah.

38:45.874 --> 38:47.794
Okay.

38:49.236 --> 38:53.047
Joe Delouise said we
would have an exorcism.

38:53.048 --> 38:58.095
And in fact, he informed me that he was
gonna bring along a professional exorcist.

38:58.096 --> 39:01.689
They want to put it on TV.
NBC wants to film it.

39:01.690 --> 39:06.435
He told NBC that we have a
very unusual situation.

39:06.436 --> 39:08.295
What do you think?

39:08.296 --> 39:12.335
I wasn't much for ridicule, and so...

39:12.336 --> 39:15.653
I didn't know what to do. Uh...

39:15.654 --> 39:18.906
But this was very serious, and
it's something that had hurt us.

39:18.907 --> 39:20.827
Okay.

39:21.711 --> 39:24.171
So I agreed.

39:27.248 --> 39:29.559
The day of the exorcism arrived.

39:29.560 --> 39:33.103
There were people all over the place,
and camera people and sound people,

39:33.104 --> 39:35.105
and people coming in and out.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.991
And I lost track of who everybody was.

39:37.992 --> 39:40.493
- Buddy, can I have some help?
- Yeah.

39:40.494 --> 39:46.394
I helped a sound man close every
single window in the house.

39:46.667 --> 39:49.955
NBC told us that this was going to be,

39:49.956 --> 39:53.496
the first televised exorcism.

39:59.207 --> 40:03.217
Those of you who are staying know
you will be here for the duration.

40:03.218 --> 40:09.083
Reverend Derl-Davis, the exorcist, turned
to us and the observers, and he said...

40:09.084 --> 40:12.444
You must hold a crucifix.

40:17.031 --> 40:21.411
We all had crucifixes. We all took one.

40:22.503 --> 40:28.403
And we hoped we were protected
against whatever was gonna happen.

40:29.150 --> 40:31.610
Let's begin.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.444
Joe Delouise, the psychic,

40:38.445 --> 40:42.114
pulled up a chair and sat to
the side of the altar quietly.

40:42.115 --> 40:45.657
Reverend Davis then explained that
Joe was gonna go into a trance.

40:45.658 --> 40:51.558
And what he was gonna attempt to do
is to communicate with the spirits.

41:03.044 --> 41:06.944
It was very quiet at that point.

41:07.995 --> 41:10.597
Dear Lord, we humbly pray.

41:10.598 --> 41:12.636
Father, we are powerless,

41:12.637 --> 41:16.790
and we recognize our utter
dependence on you and your power.

41:16.791 --> 41:19.293
[Shuffling and creaking]

41:19.294 --> 41:21.661
And all of a sudden, Joe Delouise...

41:21.662 --> 41:25.082
We could see his movement.

41:33.090 --> 41:38.478
Look with mercy upon us and all
those who will dwell in his house.

41:38.479 --> 41:42.588
Do not look upon our sins, dear
Lord, but rather the sufferings...

41:42.589 --> 41:47.054
We were starting to get extremely nervous,
especially that poor sound man.

41:47.055 --> 41:49.935
Did you hear that?

41:49.958 --> 41:52.392
But rather on the suffering
of your beloved son...

41:52.393 --> 41:55.743
He could hear sounds that we couldn't hear.

41:55.744 --> 42:00.500
Whose bitter sacrifice and death
has reconciled us to you.

42:00.501 --> 42:03.337
[Muffled groaning and choking]

42:03.338 --> 42:05.372
By the victory of the cross...

42:05.373 --> 42:10.788
He shot out his right hand,
showing the cross in the mirror.

42:10.789 --> 42:13.227
Protect all those who
will live in this house.

42:13.228 --> 42:16.228
[Gasping and choking]

42:20.154 --> 42:22.314
[Gasping]

42:22.556 --> 42:24.358
A gust of wind just blew through...

42:24.359 --> 42:27.059
[Blinds rattling]

42:27.561 --> 42:29.729
And the venetian blinds rattled.

42:29.730 --> 42:31.498
[Rattling continues]

42:31.499 --> 42:35.402
There was no doubt in my mind that
there was something in this apartment.

42:35.403 --> 42:37.470
Be gone, evil spirits!

42:37.471 --> 42:41.167
Cast them into hell by the blood
of your son Jesus, dear Lord!

42:41.168 --> 42:44.611
Send your holy Angels to protect
us and to watch over us.

42:44.612 --> 42:46.772
[Choking]

42:50.218 --> 42:52.019
All of a sudden, we start to hear it.

42:52.020 --> 42:54.021
[Cacophony of voices and screaming]

42:54.022 --> 42:55.855
The noise was overwhelming.

42:55.856 --> 42:59.636
[Shouting and rattling continues]

43:00.161 --> 43:02.921
[Breathes sharply]

43:02.997 --> 43:06.597
[Wings flapping, crows cawing]

43:14.213 --> 43:16.853
[Wings flapping]

43:27.728 --> 43:32.288
There was thousands of birds in the trees.

43:32.406 --> 43:34.107
All screaming at the same time.

43:34.108 --> 43:36.890
Getting louder and louder.

43:36.891 --> 43:40.094
Cast into hell Satan and all evil spirits!

43:40.095 --> 43:43.630
By the blood of your son
Jesus, cast into hell.

43:43.631 --> 43:47.834
Cast them into hell Satan
and all evil spirits.

43:47.835 --> 43:50.381
By the blood of your son Jesus,

43:50.382 --> 43:55.882
send your holy Angels to watch
over us and to protect us.

43:55.883 --> 43:58.583
[Crows shrieking]

44:07.922 --> 44:09.723
[Grinding]

44:09.724 --> 44:11.884
[Gasping]

44:18.365 --> 44:20.525
[Choking]

44:36.131 --> 44:39.371
This house is now pure.

44:49.330 --> 44:52.886
I knew that they honestly tried their best.

44:52.887 --> 44:58.787
They really did believe they were doing
the work that needed to be done.

45:00.488 --> 45:06.304
My only thought at that point was, if
this exorcism don't change things.

45:06.305 --> 45:10.152
I'm gonna do whatever I can.
I'll give my blood. I'll do whatever.

45:10.153 --> 45:13.093
We're out of here.

45:19.071 --> 45:22.629
This whole experience
was tormenting my life.

45:22.630 --> 45:26.170
I had to get out of there.

45:29.437 --> 45:33.517
So I took off and never came back.

45:37.545 --> 45:39.379
And along comes my sister.

45:39.380 --> 45:41.563
It's not happening.
It's just not gonna happen.

45:41.564 --> 45:45.304
Please, Ed, come on. It'll be like
old times, like when we were kids.

45:45.305 --> 45:48.158
I don't think it's a good idea, April.
You know what's been happening here.

45:48.159 --> 45:51.759
April saw the footage on TV.

45:51.814 --> 45:54.494
And she decided she wanted to live
in the first-floor apartment.

45:54.495 --> 45:57.231
- Please, Ed? Come on.
- It's dangerous.

45:57.232 --> 46:00.934
After what we just went through, I didn't
want to face that again, so I said...

46:00.935 --> 46:02.436
April, I don't think it's a good idea.

46:02.437 --> 46:03.637
[Sighs]

46:03.638 --> 46:05.357
I know how to take care of those ghosts.

46:05.358 --> 46:07.433
[Chuckles]

46:07.434 --> 46:10.151
I just... I really...
I really want to live here.

46:10.152 --> 46:13.054
She was just insistent that
she had to live there.

46:13.055 --> 46:14.756
[Sighs]

46:14.757 --> 46:16.750
You're not gonna take no
for an answer, are you?

46:16.751 --> 46:18.924
Is that a yes?

46:18.925 --> 46:20.824
So I finally agreed, okay.

46:20.825 --> 46:23.585
- Yes.
- Ah! Oh!

46:23.692 --> 46:28.252
Thank you! Thank you! Oh, I'm so excited!

46:28.718 --> 46:31.838
Oh, I love this room.

46:32.102 --> 46:36.320
April brought in an old piano.
I said, April, do you play?

46:36.321 --> 46:39.540
And she said, no, I just love pianos.

46:39.541 --> 46:43.861
She said, I always wanted to have one.

47:10.571 --> 47:13.998
It wasn't long after that
she came and said...

47:13.999 --> 47:17.792
Our chandelier moves frequently, a lot.

47:17.793 --> 47:20.733
[Chandelier creaking]

47:21.339 --> 47:24.788
And she said, is that the ghost?

47:24.789 --> 47:27.669
[Creaking continues]

47:29.098 --> 47:30.274
[Sighs]

47:30.275 --> 47:32.195
Gosh.

47:34.003 --> 47:39.040
She was too flippant about
it, too excited about it.

47:39.041 --> 47:42.210
And to her, this was like a ghost party.

47:42.211 --> 47:43.478
[Giggles]

47:43.479 --> 47:44.839
Aren't you excited?

47:44.840 --> 47:47.048
- I guess.
- This is gonna be so creepy.

47:47.049 --> 47:49.851
My brother keeps telling me about all
this stuff that keeps happening,

47:49.852 --> 47:53.247
like, over in the other apartment
and upstairs, like, you know?

47:53.248 --> 47:55.323
It's, like, crazy. Like...

47:55.324 --> 47:57.158
[Laughter]

47:57.159 --> 48:00.992
I went downstairs one day because
I heard a lot of commotion.

48:00.993 --> 48:05.433
And here's my sister-in-law whooping
it up, a whole bunch of girls.

48:05.434 --> 48:08.765
Like, the water is always running...

48:08.766 --> 48:11.305
[Whispering] Anyway, okay, let's...
come on.

48:11.306 --> 48:12.949
Okay, so you just put
your fingers on...

48:12.950 --> 48:18.182
They put out a Ouija Board,
and they had their hands out.

48:18.183 --> 48:19.966
And then April said...

48:19.967 --> 48:25.307
So we want to know if there's
anyone here with us.

48:37.700 --> 48:39.560
Yes.

48:42.838 --> 48:45.238
Who's here?

48:47.983 --> 48:49.723
H.

48:51.940 --> 48:53.680
E.

48:56.127 --> 48:57.867
N.

49:01.042 --> 49:04.582
It was spelling out a name.

49:11.860 --> 49:13.600
R.

49:24.812 --> 49:26.552
Y.

49:31.520 --> 49:33.500
Henry.

49:33.929 --> 49:35.679
Henry?

49:35.680 --> 49:38.140
Who's Henry?

49:39.908 --> 49:42.096
What are you doing, April?

49:42.097 --> 49:44.099
I'm just having a little bit of fun.

49:44.100 --> 49:46.360
[Scoffing and laughter]

49:46.361 --> 49:49.270
Okay, that's a little creepy.

49:49.271 --> 49:51.369
Ed's reaction was very angry.

49:51.370 --> 49:53.341
[Door opens]

49:53.342 --> 49:57.320
When I heard that she was using
the Ouija Board, I flipped.

49:57.321 --> 49:59.848
I was in a blind rage.

49:59.849 --> 50:04.154
I just starting ripping it,
bending it, folding it.

50:04.155 --> 50:07.255
And tearing it into pieces.

50:07.256 --> 50:08.689
So I warned her. I said...

50:08.690 --> 50:12.608
You bring anything like this into
this house again and you're gone!

50:12.609 --> 50:15.549
Do you... understand?

50:15.831 --> 50:21.411
You just kind of knew that
April was playing with fire.

50:21.536 --> 50:23.936
[Door slams]

50:25.683 --> 50:28.263
Who was Henry?

50:39.808 --> 50:42.505
I needed to find out about this spirit.

50:42.506 --> 50:45.970
And the one person that could
probably tell me give me a hint,

50:45.971 --> 50:49.015
or an indicator was my neighbor Walter.

50:49.016 --> 50:51.285
There was another man in the house.

50:51.286 --> 50:55.081
I believe he was the youngest son.

50:55.082 --> 50:58.022
His name was Henry.

50:58.048 --> 51:01.870
I think the family were ashamed of him.

51:01.871 --> 51:03.682
Why?

51:03.683 --> 51:08.543
The exact words Walter
used was, he was evil.

51:10.687 --> 51:12.973
His own family didn't like him.

51:12.974 --> 51:17.874
They restricted his travel, and
they kept him in the house.

51:17.875 --> 51:23.775
I only ever saw him looking out
the window on the second floor.

51:25.987 --> 51:30.849
If his own family felt he
was dangerous to them.

51:30.850 --> 51:36.250
How dangerous was he that
they had to lock him away?

51:39.263 --> 51:42.146
The last thing I wanted April to do...

51:42.147 --> 51:46.360
Was to conjure the spirit of Henry Verdere.

51:46.361 --> 51:50.833
That would be opening up a can of worms
that's just totally unpredictable.

51:50.834 --> 51:53.654
Uh, and dangerous.

52:04.852 --> 52:07.732
[Piano key strikes]

52:12.902 --> 52:15.842
[Bass notes playing]

52:19.887 --> 52:25.787
April started confiding in me that
her piano was playing itself.

52:27.524 --> 52:30.584
Marsha, what's wrong?

52:32.202 --> 52:34.035
Marsha?

52:34.036 --> 52:35.990
I don't want to talk about it.

52:35.991 --> 52:38.691
Marsha, tell me.

52:38.893 --> 52:41.275
It's your sister.

52:41.276 --> 52:45.845
Marsha said she was worried
about April, and I said, why?

52:45.846 --> 52:49.672
April told Marsha that she felt...

52:49.673 --> 52:52.199
She had established this connection.

52:52.200 --> 52:56.750
And she was actually
excited by the connection.

52:56.751 --> 53:02.651
And April told her she started
hearing voices from the basement.

54:00.009 --> 54:04.269
I felt I was definitely being watched.

54:15.908 --> 54:19.063
I started to worry for my sister.

54:19.064 --> 54:22.930
Because I saw this huge
change come over her.

54:22.931 --> 54:25.511
[Piano playing]

54:26.268 --> 54:30.438
All of a sudden, the piano
that was such a novelty.

54:30.439 --> 54:34.096
Started to become more of a torment.

54:34.097 --> 54:35.217
Ding...

54:35.218 --> 54:36.609
Ding...

54:36.610 --> 54:38.530
Ding.

54:39.613 --> 54:45.513
Like at a cadence, like, notice me,
notice me, I'm here, I'm here.

54:49.609 --> 54:52.909
[Disjointed notes playing]

55:00.769 --> 55:02.929
[Sobbing]

55:08.377 --> 55:10.107
[Sobs]

55:10.108 --> 55:16.008
April started to tell me that she was
being touched in very inappropriate ways.

55:16.449 --> 55:19.089
Leave me alone!

55:19.633 --> 55:22.033
Get off me!

55:22.722 --> 55:25.362
Leave me alone!

55:26.459 --> 55:28.619
[Screams]

55:34.379 --> 55:37.318
My wife saw April talking to herself.

55:37.319 --> 55:43.199
Uh, she claimed she was hearing
voices saying, kill yourself.

55:48.574 --> 55:51.634
So I was in despair.

55:58.773 --> 56:01.953
[Ominous melody playing]

56:25.658 --> 56:28.298
[Glass shatters]

56:48.408 --> 56:53.868
I didn't know what she was
capable of by that point.

57:18.553 --> 57:22.633
What would put her in such despair?

57:32.340 --> 57:34.320
April?

57:35.454 --> 57:41.154
April claimed she was hearing
voices saying, kill yourself.

57:44.726 --> 57:49.826
And I started having real,
real terrible thoughts.

57:53.239 --> 57:57.619
Amelia had hung herself in the basement.

58:23.302 --> 58:29.202
On the back wall of the basement,
which I thought was the back wall...

58:30.742 --> 58:33.562
There was a door.

58:41.146 --> 58:45.046
It had a huge heavy, heavy hasp.

59:13.051 --> 59:15.571
It was empty.

59:28.167 --> 59:34.067
I realized that whoever lived in
this room was locked in this room.

59:35.674 --> 59:40.654
Piece by piece, this puzzle
was coming together.

59:50.930 --> 59:53.930
[Piano notes playing]

59:55.373 --> 59:59.273
Now, it... it became a revelation.

01:00:09.074 --> 01:00:13.394
This was where Henry was locked inside.

01:00:18.252 --> 01:00:21.312
What happened to him?

01:00:27.759 --> 01:00:29.754
[Gun cocks]

01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:31.996
I find bullets...

01:00:31.997 --> 01:00:34.547
You know, I think he died mysteriously.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:38.508
Was he shot? Did his own family...

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.420
Put him to death?

01:00:49.348 --> 01:00:52.948
[Gunshot, light bulb shatters]

01:01:16.667 --> 01:01:18.574
At that moment, I made the decision that

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:20.852
there was only one way out
and that was to sell.

01:01:20.853 --> 01:01:24.633
To leave, to get out of there.

01:01:33.314 --> 01:01:35.548
I was afraid of being pulled back in.

01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:37.850
I knew... I had a feeling...

01:01:37.851 --> 01:01:42.831
That house would not
voluntarily let us all go.

01:01:46.193 --> 01:01:51.113
I did not want to believe
that I was leaving.

01:01:51.165 --> 01:01:55.343
As a man, as a Father, as a husband.

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:59.672
You feel lacking, you feel inadequate.
You feel...

01:01:59.673 --> 01:02:03.873
Somehow I wasn't able to do my job.

01:02:07.783 --> 01:02:11.263
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:17.757
We never owned that house.
The Verdere family owned that house.

01:02:17.758 --> 01:02:23.658
They're always gonna own that house,
and we were just the tenants.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.890
It was about three weeks later
that the police found her.

01:02:50.891 --> 01:02:53.951
Are you April Becker?

01:02:54.128 --> 01:02:56.164
I have no doubt...

01:02:56.165 --> 01:03:00.033
That whatever she saw or experienced
and what she conjured...

01:03:00.034 --> 01:03:03.334
Changed her life forever.

01:03:13.111 --> 01:03:18.511
I should never have let her
move into that apartment.

01:03:38.387 --> 01:03:41.226
This house... this house has been purified.

01:03:41.227 --> 01:03:44.107
Let that be known.

01:03:44.178 --> 01:03:46.012
The house is clean.
