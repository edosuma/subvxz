Hey, guys.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.375
Mandy: Hi.
Hi, honey.

00:09.377 --> 00:10.542
What's that smell?

00:10.544 --> 00:12.378
Takeout
from emperor's garden.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.146
We're getting
our won ton on.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.115
Sorry, honey.
I didn't have time to cook.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.149
Hey.
All right.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.152
Another American job
outsourced to the chinese.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.121
So,
what's all this mess?

00:22.123 --> 00:24.023
Uh, the pta
Halloween fundraiser.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.657
I thought we were done
with that pta stuff.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.226
Isn't that the upside
of being grandparents?

00:27.228 --> 00:29.695
You don't have to deal
with all the school crap?

00:29.697 --> 00:30.729
You mean improving

00:30.731 --> 00:33.065
The educational environment
for my child?

00:33.067 --> 00:36.035
Yeah. School crap.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.469
No, honey,
Kristin and I got suckered

00:37.471 --> 00:38.871
Into running
the haunted house

00:38.873 --> 00:40.873
Because
nobody else volunteered.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.174
Suckered into it?

00:42.176 --> 00:43.575
Your hand shot up
as soon as it was m--
well -- no --

00:43.577 --> 00:44.910
You might have
even yelled "dibs."
okay.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.478
Let me
explain something.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.080
If your mom
wasn't the type

00:48.082 --> 00:49.815
To volunteer
for unpleasant jobs,

00:49.817 --> 00:51.250
None of you
would exist.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.555
Kristin, listen,
this move is gonna be great

00:56.557 --> 00:58.157
For your pta career.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.324
Can't I just sit back
and mock people

00:59.326 --> 01:01.693
Who say things
like "your pta career"?
No -- I --

01:01.695 --> 01:04.663
You nail the fall fundraiser,
you're a hero.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.166
You can just coast
until the easter-egg hunt.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.001
[ groans ]
easter eggs are disgusting.

01:09.003 --> 01:11.870
I would never eat anything
that came out of a rabbit.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.672
Oh,
look at these, uh --

01:13.674 --> 01:15.040
Look at these
pumpkin lights, mom?

01:15.042 --> 01:17.076
Those are cute. Yeah?
Oh, yay, yeah.

01:17.078 --> 01:20.779
Those would be great
if our theme was "lame."

01:20.781 --> 01:22.848
How come the haunted house
has to be scary?

01:22.850 --> 01:25.417
Because otherwise
it's just a house

01:25.419 --> 01:28.087
And we'd be realtors.

01:28.089 --> 01:32.124
Come on. The goal is
to scare the heck out of kids.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.560
I thought the goal
was to raise money.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.595
Yeah, by scaring the heck
out of kids.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.863
You know,
when I was pta president,

01:37.865 --> 01:41.066
My haunted houses
always made money.

01:41.068 --> 01:44.603
Last year, helen potts and
her geniuses barely broke even.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.405
You know
what their theme was?

01:46.407 --> 01:48.607
Happy,
happy mermaids.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.043
I'm just concerned
'cause little kids Boyd's age

01:51.045 --> 01:52.311
Are so sensitive,
you know?

01:52.313 --> 01:54.213
Boo!
Ohh!

01:54.215 --> 01:55.414
Classic!

01:55.416 --> 01:56.982
Getting people
to stain their skivvies --

01:56.984 --> 01:59.218
That's what Halloween
is all about.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.086
That is the reason
for the season.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.922
Yeah, see, Kristin? Getting
scared is fun. I love it.

02:03.924 --> 02:04.923
Boo!

02:04.925 --> 02:06.558
You got to work
on the timing.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.127
[ doorbell rings ]

02:08.129 --> 02:09.962
All right, now go see if you can
scare your aunt Mandy.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.130
And remember
everything I said, okay?

02:11.132 --> 02:15.400
Awesome! Aunt Mandy,
I'm not coming upstairs!

02:17.137 --> 02:19.938
It's a --
it's a timing thing.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.974
Hey, fellas.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.275
Hey, Mike.
Hey, mr. B.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.978
Come on in.
I got my coffin
in the back of Kyle's van.

02:25.980 --> 02:29.615
So, I was right about
that weird-looking mole.

02:29.617 --> 02:34.019
Vanessa wanted to look in
my coffin for her haunted house.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.688
Vanessa,
your coffin is here.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.123
Vanessa: Great. Yeah.
Just a minute.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.691
Why do you have
a coffin?

02:39.693 --> 02:42.594
Oh. Mr. Alzate
got it at costco.

02:43.930 --> 02:47.466
They have everything.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.868
Well, you see, Kyle and I were
shopping for our camping trip,

02:49.870 --> 02:52.037
And I-I bought
the jumbo-sized bacon,

02:52.039 --> 02:54.506
And it got me thinking
about mortality.

02:54.508 --> 02:58.877
Why would you cut back on bacon
when coffins are so cheap?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.479
Oh, and it's --
it's a beauty, too --

03:00.481 --> 03:02.981
20-gauge steel construction,
gold swing-bar handles,

03:02.983 --> 03:05.350
And a white,
crepe interior.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.386
The sausalito.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.988
All right. Let me get a look
at this pine box.
Yeah.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.791
Hey, Ed, thanks.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.893
Oh, hi.
Ooh. Hey, honey.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.128
Hey, dad.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.529
Mr. Alzate,
it's good to see you.
Hey, kiddo.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.132
Sweet coffin outside.
Who died?

03:20.134 --> 03:21.132
[ chuckles ]

03:21.134 --> 03:24.136
Ed if he doesn't have
that mole looked at.

03:24.138 --> 03:26.538
"s.P." what's that?
Shore patrol?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.207
School safety police.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.409
Yeah, I get to bust heads
and take names.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.978
I also get called names.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.347
Now you're a narc,
huh?

03:35.349 --> 03:37.316
Well, I'd love
to get a narco bust.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.651
But so far,
my collars have been tardies,

03:39.653 --> 03:42.487
Talking in a library,
and a lot of dsos.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.991
Disrespecting
safety officers.
Ooh.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.359
Those kids will need
a home loan one day

03:47.361 --> 03:49.995
And that dso --
come back to haunt them.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.397
Keep on joking, dad, but when
your math book goes missing,

03:52.399 --> 03:54.166
Ask a hippie
to find it.

03:54.168 --> 03:58.370
Now, Ed, that coffin is great,
but, uh, you know what?

03:58.372 --> 04:00.072
Did you notice
there's a scratch on it?

04:00.074 --> 04:02.574
Yeah, I know. I know.
It's a return.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.079
You should have seen
the scratch marks on the inside.

04:11.017 --> 04:13.719
Mike, I, uh --
[ clears throat ]

04:13.721 --> 04:17.522
I really admire Eve's moxie
with this junior r.O.T.C. Thing.
Right.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.692
But there's nothing teenagers
hate worse than a snitch.

04:20.694 --> 04:24.296
Don't want their dads giving
them a kiss at drop-off either.

04:24.298 --> 04:27.132
I was -- I was an m.P.
In vietnam, yeah?
Yeah.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.801
Yeah, and the troops
despised us, more than the v.C.,

04:29.803 --> 04:32.804
More than hanoi jane, more than
that idiot disc jockey.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.707
There were no good mornings
in vietnam.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.176
But other than that,
the war was fun, right?

04:39.979 --> 04:42.080
You know, Kristin,
you're -- you're so busy

04:42.082 --> 04:43.982
With work and Boyd,
why don't you let me

04:43.984 --> 04:45.817
Deal with all
the boring details.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.819
So, I let you
do everything your way

04:47.821 --> 04:49.388
And just
keep my mouth shut.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.989
That would be so helpful.

04:50.991 --> 04:54.960
Boo!

04:54.962 --> 04:56.228

Hey.

Ahh.
Welcome to tonight's
pre-Halloween dress rehearsal.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.014
I hear mom's makeup
looks great.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.416
What do you mean
you hear it's great?

05:17.418 --> 05:18.684
Aren't you in charge
of this thing?

05:18.686 --> 05:20.485
No, the only thing
she let me be in charge of

05:20.487 --> 05:21.687
Was hanging up the posters.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.922
And even then,
I used the wrong tape.

05:23.924 --> 05:27.326
Well, I just need to get back
in time to stop those jerks

05:27.328 --> 05:29.261
Who always t.P. Our house
on mischief night.

What's mischief night?

Tonight. The --
the night before Halloween.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.100
Kids go around
vandalizing stuff.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.236
[ laughing ] oh.
You mean cabbage night.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.940
What? That's what we call it
up in winnipeg?

05:41.942 --> 05:44.976
What do you call the night
when everyone eats cabbage?

05:44.978 --> 05:46.378
Ah, canada.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.947
They are building that wall
on the wrong border.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.549
Yeah,
we feel the same way.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.783
We're just too polite
to say it.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.153
Come on, Boyd.
Let's ditch these hosers, eh?

05:55.155 --> 05:58.156
Hey, ma! Come on!

05:58.158 --> 06:00.225
Let's get this show on the road.
I got a party to get to.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.027
Oh, yeah?
What's your costume this year?

06:02.029 --> 06:05.397
Yeah. Slutty nurse,
slutty cop, slutty narwhal?

06:05.399 --> 06:07.966
Yeah. Actually, I'm --
I'm not wearing a costume.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.302
Oh, so slutty...
College student?

06:11.838 --> 06:13.572
Uh, babe, one of your posters
fell down again.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.675
Fine, okay? I admit it.
She was right about the tape.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.677
Hey, Eve,
you know, um,

06:18.679 --> 06:20.479
It's not really cool
making women feel bad

06:20.481 --> 06:22.214
About their modes
of sexual expression.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.015
We were talking about it
in sociology class.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.584
It's called
slut-shaming.

06:25.586 --> 06:29.054
And you were there
as a visual aid?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.022
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Oh, my god, you're so funny.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.391

to worry about

the house tonight.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.395
I'm not worried.

with the toilet paper

to watch their backs.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.265
Yeah.
You don't get it.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.933
See, the only reason
why we got t.P.'d

06:41.935 --> 06:44.002
Was because I was still
in high school.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.538
But I thought
you were so popular.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.572
I was.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.874
See, at woodbridge,
getting t.P.'d

06:48.876 --> 06:50.942
Is a sign that the cool kids
really like you, so...

06:50.944 --> 06:53.378
Oh, I'd like to see what they do
if they don't like you.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.847
Oh, you will.
You'll just get ignored.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.998
Hey!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.166
[ sighs ]

08:55.168 --> 08:57.168
I said "beware."

08:57.170 --> 08:59.571
[ laughs ] if you could get Ryan
to do that every time,

08:59.573 --> 09:01.506
This place
would make a fortune.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.707
Honey!
No, no, no.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.049
All right,
I put Boyd to bed,

09:11.051 --> 09:12.684
But I'm already late
for work.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.252
C-can't you just stay
with him?

09:14.254 --> 09:16.054
I can't.
I got the strike meeting.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.089
Look, don't worry.
Boyd is gonna be fine.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.391
If he's
anything like me,

09:19.393 --> 09:21.192
He's gonna stop crying
in an hour

09:21.194 --> 09:23.828
And just be scared of spiders
for the rest of his life.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.498
I got to go.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.666
Love you.
Love you, too.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.067
All right. There.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.236
His, uh,
pants are clean and dry.

09:31.238 --> 09:35.574
God. Has he ever wet himself
like that before?

09:35.576 --> 09:37.943
Every time he's seen
a spider twice his size.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.444
So, no, never.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.780
I know.
I am so sorry.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.682
You know, I-I think you should
run the haunted house.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.051
Where did Ryan just go?
Strike meeting.

09:46.053 --> 09:49.087
Boy, on cabbage night?
Is nothing sacred?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.923
You know, clearly,
today was all my fault.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.391
Honey, I-I just
made that haunted house

09:53.393 --> 09:54.593
Too scary
for little kids.

09:54.595 --> 09:55.927
The haunted house
wasn't too scary,

09:55.929 --> 09:57.195
And this
is not your fault.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.464
Whose fault is it
then? What...

09:59.466 --> 10:00.765
Me?!

10:00.767 --> 10:03.101
All I did was put up posters
with the wrong tape, okay?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.469
How is this my fault?

10:04.471 --> 10:06.905
You don't deal with that kid
being afraid of anything.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.040
He can't sleep at night,
so you leave the light on.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.209
He won't go to bed, so
you let him sleep with you guys.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.446
You take him to a petting zoo,
and you shoo away the goats.

10:15.715 --> 10:18.917
You know
about the goat trauma.
Oh, yeah.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.853
Tries to milk a male goat?
I'm with the male goat on this.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.056
You got to teach that kid to
deal with uncomfortable things.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.791
Otherwise,
he'll be sitting on that couch,

10:26.793 --> 10:28.593
He'll learn that hillary's
running for president,

10:28.595 --> 10:30.228
He's gonna
wet the couch.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.465
I don't think
that's gonna happen, honey.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.334
Oh, trust me,
she's running.

10:38.237 --> 10:40.071
I'm sorry, dad, okay,

10:40.073 --> 10:41.806
But I am not taking Boyd
to school tomorrow.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.608
I don't want him going through
that haunted house again.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.809
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.479
He runs into stuff
that's unpleasant,

10:47.481 --> 10:49.114
You rob him of the chance
to overcome it.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.448
All right,
I have to, okay?

10:50.450 --> 10:52.250
What if he chickens out
in front of his friends

10:52.252 --> 10:55.086
O-or, even worse,
pees his pants again?

10:55.088 --> 10:58.089
Hey, hey. What if
we put him in a costume
that's really absorbent?

10:59.358 --> 11:03.094
Wasn't -- wasn't he spongebob
a few years ago?

11:03.096 --> 11:06.698
Here's an idea --
let's put him back in there,

11:06.700 --> 11:08.700
He can face that spider,
and maybe come out there

11:08.702 --> 11:09.868
Feeling
like a little hero.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.036
Yeah. That --
that would be great.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.370
But -- but what if
it doesn't work?

11:12.372 --> 11:14.039
You remember
when you were his age?

11:14.041 --> 11:15.507
You didn't want to
take swim lessons.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.975
You were afraid
to go off the diving board,

11:16.977 --> 11:18.443
And I wouldn't let you
stop the swim lessons.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.611
Remember why?

11:19.613 --> 11:22.047
Yeah, 'cause you already
paid that guy 40 bucks.

11:24.316 --> 11:25.884
I didn't want
you to quit.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.385
Yeah, I remember.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.154
You -- you climbed up there,
wrapped your arms around me,

11:29.156 --> 11:30.989
And we jumped
off the board together.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.525
We pretty much invented
synchronized diving, you and I.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.327
But if you hadn't done it
and faced your fear,

11:36.329 --> 11:38.363
You would have never become
the good diver you became.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.065
Okay, dad, if you can get Boyd
to face his fear,

11:40.067 --> 11:41.566
Then we'll go to the
haunted house tomorrow, okay?

11:41.568 --> 11:43.368
Good night. Mwah.
Good night.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.170
Let's, uh,
try not to traumatize him

11:45.172 --> 11:46.871
Any more than necessary.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.074
Well, w-which one of us
was that directed at?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.275
Exactly.

11:53.145 --> 11:55.547
You.
You.

11:55.549 --> 11:59.150
It's you.
You with the big spider.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.355
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for outdoor man,

12:04.357 --> 12:08.359
Where the knives, machetes,
and axes are all real.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.161
But don't be afraid

12:10.163 --> 12:11.930
'cause during
this Halloween holiday,

12:11.932 --> 12:15.366
They're also 20% off.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.002
You know, fear --
interesting thing.

12:18.004 --> 12:22.774
Fdr said, "the only thing
we have to fear is fear itself."

12:22.776 --> 12:25.176
Of course, that big old
socialist might have added

12:25.178 --> 12:27.579
"you should also fear
the massive government programs

12:27.581 --> 12:29.581
I'll saddle
this country with forever!"

12:29.583 --> 12:31.583
[ chuckles ]

12:31.585 --> 12:33.384
Frank herbert's book "dune"

12:33.386 --> 12:35.954
Had a great sci-fi hero,
paul muad'dib.

12:35.956 --> 12:39.190
He said,
"fear is the mind killer.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.794
Fear is the little death
that brings total obliteration."

12:42.796 --> 12:43.962
If you get really terrified,
of course,

12:43.964 --> 12:46.965
You obliterate
your long johns --

12:46.967 --> 12:49.567
Also on sale here
at outdoor man.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.569
But I think
mark twain said it best.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.706
"real courage
is the mastery of fear,

12:54.708 --> 12:56.741
Not the absence of fear."

12:56.743 --> 12:58.276
Our first responders
and firemen

12:58.278 --> 12:59.911
Aren't brave
because they don't feel fear.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.312
Of course they do.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.315
They're brave because they run
into burning buildings anyway.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.750
That's the kind of courage

13:05.752 --> 13:07.752
We should be striving for
for all of us.

13:07.754 --> 13:08.920
And no matter
what you're afraid of,

13:08.922 --> 13:11.556
I promise you we carry something
at outdoor man

13:11.558 --> 13:13.625
That will kill it.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.296
[ knock on door ]
hey, Boyd, I really want
you to try to sleep

13:18.298 --> 13:20.131
Without the light on,
all right?

13:20.133 --> 13:24.068
I'm still thinking
about that scary spider.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.270
It's kind of silly.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.505
In these walls alone,
there's thousands of spiders

13:27.507 --> 13:29.841
Far more dangerous
than that one.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.309
That's probably
not very helpful, is it?

13:31.311 --> 13:35.113
None of that stuff was real
in there, kid.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.915
You know that,
don't you?

13:36.917 --> 13:39.617
I dressed you up
like frankenstein --
you're not a monster

13:39.619 --> 13:41.753
'cause real monsters
are ticklish.

13:41.755 --> 13:43.054
And you're not ticklish.
[ laughing ]

13:46.525 --> 13:49.093
Listen, everything you saw
in that house was fake.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.129
So nobody ever had an ax
in his head?

13:51.131 --> 13:53.264
Well, given all the axes
in the world and all the heads,

13:53.266 --> 13:55.767
Odds are someone has an ax
in their head.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.335
But I got a catalog
that we get at the house,

13:57.337 --> 13:59.938
And look what I found --
a jumping spider, $79.99.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.539
It's made
out of plastic.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.976
$79.99?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.144
Your grandma paid 80 bucks
for that thing?

14:06.146 --> 14:08.713
I'm gonna pee
in <i>my</i> pants.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.115
It's just filled with all
the stuff you saw in there.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.952
"crawling monster hand --
buy one, get one free."

14:13.954 --> 14:16.354
Yeah,
crawling monster hand --

14:16.356 --> 14:20.124
That's what the girls
used to call me in high school.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.894
There's nothing in here
for you to be scared of,

14:22.896 --> 14:25.063
And there's nothing in there
to be scared of.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.398
Would you think about going
in that haunted house again?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.634
I don't know.
What if I went with you?

14:29.636 --> 14:30.635
And I will go with you.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.637
I'll hold your hand,
you and I together.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.138
Okay.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.974
Okay.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.809
It takes a brave man
to face his fears.

14:37.811 --> 14:38.977
It really does.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.145
And you're a brave man,
Boyd Baxter.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.513
All right.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.717
Just you sleep tight.
I'm gonna shut the lights off.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.085
And as my grandma says,
"sleep tight,

14:47.087 --> 14:49.921
And don't let
the bedbugs bite."

14:49.923 --> 14:53.258
Bedbugs?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.867
Sports!

15:02.869 --> 15:06.304
Hey,
who's out there?!

15:07.773 --> 15:11.376
Because you're just in time
for batting practice.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.077
Eve, it's me, Mandy.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.879
What's our
home phone number?

15:14.881 --> 15:17.248
Star-4.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.716
[ sighs ] it is you.

15:18.718 --> 15:22.520
Okay, why are you t.P.'ing
your own house?

15:22.522 --> 15:25.089
Did you forget
where you live again?
No.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.926
No, these, um -- these, like,
big football players came by,

15:27.928 --> 15:29.060
And I scared them off,

15:29.062 --> 15:31.362
So I had to take the stuff
away from them.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.932
Nice try, Mandy, but
if the football team was here,

15:33.934 --> 15:36.901
You would have invited them
into the bushes with you.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.903
All right,
you know what?

15:38.905 --> 15:40.705
I was actually out here
because I felt bad

15:40.707 --> 15:42.874
For being mean to you earlier,
but I don't anymore,

15:42.876 --> 15:43.875
Because you deserve it.

15:43.877 --> 15:46.878
Wait.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.248
So, you're saying you've been
out in the cold

15:50.250 --> 15:52.083
Trying to make it
look like we got t.P.'d

15:52.085 --> 15:54.986
Because you want to
protect my feelings?

15:54.988 --> 15:56.788
Yeah,
but it was a stupid idea,

15:56.790 --> 15:58.656
Thinking
that you had feelings.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.058
Thank you.

16:01.493 --> 16:02.927
What?

16:02.929 --> 16:06.931
I said, "thank you."

16:06.933 --> 16:09.500
That was a nice thing
you couldn't quite do.

16:09.502 --> 16:14.739
T.P.'ing is not as easy
as it looks.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.908
You're not as easy
as you look, Mandy,

16:16.910 --> 16:19.143
Despite all my killer slams
on the topic.

16:20.946 --> 16:24.983
Sometimes I say
that stuff because...

16:24.985 --> 16:27.118
It just bugs me
how popular you are.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.320
Hey, you could be popular,
too,

16:29.322 --> 16:31.122
If you just changed
every single thing

16:31.124 --> 16:34.025
That you do
in high school.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.094
Well, I'm pretty popular
with my crowd.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.496
Mm.
The unpopular kids.

16:38.498 --> 16:42.000
[ smacks lips ]
yep. That's my posse.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.801
Hey,
who needs cool kids

16:43.803 --> 16:44.969
When you have
an awesome big sister

16:44.971 --> 16:48.172
Willing to t.P. Her own yard
for you, hmm?

16:49.975 --> 16:51.576
I love you.
I love you, too.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.848
Vanessa: Hey, Mike?
Hmm?

16:56.850 --> 16:57.982
You need to go
to the store.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.050
I don't think
we have enough candy

16:59.052 --> 17:01.119
For the trick-or-treaters
tonight.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.854
Oh, there's plenty.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.655
You just got to use an old trick
my dad taught me.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.357
You put one in, right?
Uh-huh.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.993
And while they're not looking,
you take two out.

17:08.995 --> 17:10.561
Oh, stop.
That's terrible!

17:10.563 --> 17:12.730
Aren't you supposed to be
on your broomstick about now?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.332
[ sighs ] no, no.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.367
Uh, Kristin's gonna run
the haunted house tonight.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.136
No, I meant
your real broomstick.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.738
This place is looking
like a pigsty.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.040
Oh, cut it out,
cut it out!

17:22.042 --> 17:25.043
I'm just
trying to cheer you up.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.744
Yeah, and you stink at it.
Y-you know what?

17:26.746 --> 17:28.379
I feel bad enough
about the haunted house.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.847
I really --
I don't want to go.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.015
Honey,
you did all the work.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.084
Yeah,
and I screwed it all up.

17:33.086 --> 17:36.320
I got all caught up trying
to relive my pta glory days.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.688
[ chuckles ]

17:37.690 --> 17:40.858
A geology career just wasn't
as fulfilling as you thought.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.027
You trying to
cheer me up again?

17:43.029 --> 17:45.163
I never understood why you did
all that pta work anyway.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.564
Honey, you know what?

17:46.566 --> 17:47.999
It's just --
it's such a rush

17:48.001 --> 17:49.167
Doing something
with the kids

17:49.169 --> 17:52.036
And -- and having it turn out
really well.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.404
You should go.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.842
No. You know what?
It's -- it's not mine anymore.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.010
It's Kristin's pta,

17:59.012 --> 18:01.679
And then it should be
her haunted house.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.081
It's probably full

18:03.083 --> 18:07.118
Of boring pumpkin lights
and mermaids, but...

18:07.120 --> 18:09.720
But you do this to support the
people you love. You should go.

18:09.722 --> 18:13.124
Well, want to come
and support me?

18:13.126 --> 18:17.128
Boy, I painted myself
into that corner.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.230
Did you guys
see the yard?

18:19.232 --> 18:21.432
What?
We got hit
on mischief night.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.135
What? No.
Yeah. Come here.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.908
Oh, for crap's sake.

18:30.910 --> 18:35.446
Oh!
It's a winter wonderland!

18:35.448 --> 18:37.915
I know!
It's a mess!

18:37.917 --> 18:41.352
Wouldn't it be cool
if the google car drove by now?

18:45.090 --> 18:47.325
Mandy: Where did all this
come from?

18:47.327 --> 18:49.961
It's from my junior
r.O.T.C. Platoon.

18:49.963 --> 18:53.664
And they left
their calling card.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.066
I can't get too mad.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.135
They bought these
at outdoor man.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.304
Honey, somebody
took those pants off

19:00.306 --> 19:02.106
In your daughter's
front yard.

19:02.108 --> 19:05.109
All right, I'm mad.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.011
Hey, Mandy,
this is way more toilet paper

19:07.013 --> 19:08.079
Than you got
last year.

19:08.081 --> 19:09.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take it down a notch.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.115
Act like
you've been there before.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.283
All right.
You know what, Mike?

19:12.285 --> 19:14.152
This is a big job.
We'd better get started.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.154
Just let her enjoy it
a little bit.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.992
And then we'll make her
clean it up all by herself.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.927
[ laughs ]

19:30.135 --> 19:31.369
Sweetie,
you look amazing! Wow!

19:31.371 --> 19:34.705
Oh, please.
I am half the hag you are.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.307
Now, come on.
Don't fight, girls.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.476
You're both
tremendous hags.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.312
Hold on.
Boyd, Boyd, Boyd!

19:41.314 --> 19:42.780
So, um,
did you change a lot?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.715
You probably got rid
of the big spider, right?

19:44.717 --> 19:46.117
No, mom.
It's still your haunted house.

19:46.119 --> 19:48.953
The kids all love it
exactly the way it is.

19:48.955 --> 19:52.723
Aww.
The Baxter pta legacy
is secure.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.959
Well, you know, who cares
about the Baxter legacy?

19:54.961 --> 19:57.962
I mean, it --
it's really all for the...Kids.

19:57.964 --> 20:01.532
I guess it's time
for Boyd to face his fears.
Hey. There he is.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.533
All right, frank,
you ready?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.068
Just like we talked about.
Ready?

20:04.070 --> 20:06.904
No, grandpa. I don't want to.
Yes, we're going.
No, stop, stop.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.306
Listen, I told you, it's all
phony stuff. It's fake.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.807
We've looked at the catalog,
remember?
I know.

20:09.809 --> 20:13.844
That's why...
I want to go in alone.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.180
Yeah? Really?
Are you sure?

20:16.182 --> 20:18.316
He's going in.
You're going in by yourself.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.384
We're right out here.
Kristin: Good luck, sweetie.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.689
Dismembered lumberjack --
$64.99!

20:24.691 --> 20:28.693
Drop-down
spooky ghost -- $49.99.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.929
$50
for a freaking ghost?!

20:31.931 --> 20:33.130
You've got to be
kidding me!

20:34.266 --> 20:35.766
I-I heard
you guys got hit

20:35.768 --> 20:37.001
Pretty bad
for cabbage night, huh?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.402
We were slawed.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.571
Why was Eve happy
about being t.P.'d?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.939
You wouldn't understand,
dad, okay?

20:41.941 --> 20:44.008
You were never
a teenage girl.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.376
You don't know
everything about me.

20:45.378 --> 20:48.045
The '70s were a time
of experimentation.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.214
[ laughing ] okay.

20:50.216 --> 20:53.050
Uh, that -- that cowboy went in
with Boyd and he's already out.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.386
I-I wonder if Boyd's okay.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.587
You don't think
he got stuck again

20:56.589 --> 20:57.922
Staring
at that stupid spider?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.090
No, no. No,
he's frankenstein.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.090
He's probably
being chased around

21:00.092 --> 21:01.192
By the villagers
with torches, you know?

21:01.194 --> 21:04.395
[ stammers ]
oh, stay there. I'm on it.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.597
Boyd -- hey, Boyd.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.798
Boyd!

21:07.800 --> 21:10.034
Come on, Boyd.
It's grandpa. It's okay.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.102
Boyd, come on out.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.638
Boo!
[ whimpers ]

21:13.640 --> 21:15.406
It's fun to be scared.
Isn't it, grandpa?

21:15.408 --> 21:18.809
Is it?
Is it really fun?

21:18.811 --> 21:21.679
Was my arm numb
when we walked in here?

21:23.415 --> 21:25.216
Whoa.

21:25.218 --> 21:26.817
Hey, you see there?

21:26.819 --> 21:29.153
That spider
is not that scary.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.288
And not worth
80 bucks.
