01:05.625 --> 01:06.867
Good morning.

01:19.917 --> 01:21.342
Hey, Cutter.

01:21.667 --> 01:22.917
Your lawyer is here.

01:34.083 --> 01:37.000
There is literally nothing left for me to do,
your appeal was denied.

01:37.375 --> 01:39.792
Look, you got a little shy of eleven months...

01:39.875 --> 01:40.625
Ten months!

01:40.708 --> 01:42.175
Ten months. Whatever...

01:42.208 --> 01:43.375
That's better, right?

01:43.792 --> 01:45.667
Just ride it out.
You are going to do the time right.

01:45.750 --> 01:46.833
Call Keegan.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.500
- No.
- Call him.

01:50.583 --> 01:51.583
No.

01:51.875 --> 01:55.542
As your attorney, I advise you just to ride out
the eleven months.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.688
Ten months! Martin, call him.

01:57.713 --> 01:58.600
Today!

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
SUV huh?

02:21.167 --> 02:22.533
You know Daphne.

02:22.917 --> 02:24.383
What are you going to do?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.292
So, what the fuck, Ray?

02:27.458 --> 02:30.375
Nine months to go and what.
You called Keegan?

02:30.667 --> 02:31.667
Why would you do that?

02:32.333 --> 02:34.500
That's such a wicked price to pay,
you know.

02:41.042 --> 02:42.125
Fuck.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.083
You're still going to tell me what's going on, right?

02:55.167 --> 02:57.125
Oh yeah.
I'll tell you.

03:23.917 --> 03:25.208
Jesus Christ!

03:25.917 --> 03:27.333
What the hell are you doing here?

03:28.042 --> 03:29.250
You're not on the run, are you?

03:29.333 --> 03:30.917
Yeah pop, I tunnel out.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.467
Oh, that's funny.

03:32.583 --> 03:33.783
Where is he?

03:34.167 --> 03:35.367
Upstairs.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.583
How the fuck did you get out, Raymond?

04:09.875 --> 04:10.975
Yeah?

04:12.625 --> 04:13.725
Hey.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.225
Dad?

04:21.708 --> 04:22.808
Right.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.167
How did you get out?

04:26.375 --> 04:29.458
I know it's hard to believe but,
judge granted my appeal.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.675
I don't know you are into all this.

04:38.417 --> 04:40.450
What are you working on?
That's good.

04:44.833 --> 04:46.500
It's just plastic pieces.

04:46.917 --> 04:50.167
Yeah, but you got to put them together and
paint all the details...

04:50.250 --> 04:51.250
Dad.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.942
Let's not do this, okay?

05:04.167 --> 05:05.467
Yeah...

05:06.833 --> 05:08.133
Okay.

05:15.292 --> 05:16.833
<i>So?
How did it go?</i>

05:24.292 --> 05:25.592
Well...

05:27.250 --> 05:28.500
He has some tests..

05:30.042 --> 05:31.342
.. tomorrow.

05:37.667 --> 05:40.250
I like to think you didn't do something foolish...

05:41.000 --> 05:42.250
Just to be here.

05:46.792 --> 05:48.192
Oh, fuck it.

06:33.308 --> 06:34.608
Excuse me.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.667
Excuse me.
Thank you.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.875
Guys, got to get through.
Excuse me.

06:39.208 --> 06:40.208
Excuse me.
Miss.

06:43.625 --> 06:44.625
Tommy.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.000
I was just now standing there,
with my dick in my hand,

06:48.083 --> 06:49.488
I'm shaking it off and
thinking to myself.

06:49.513 --> 06:51.566
Wonder when the forger is going to
walk through my door?

06:51.625 --> 06:52.625
- Tommy.
- What?

06:53.333 --> 06:54.333
Right there.

06:55.434 --> 06:56.434
Jesus.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.408
Can't tell from the camera angle of this guy right here.

06:58.492 --> 07:00.400
He's got huge fucking balls.

07:00.417 --> 07:02.092
Dealing product from behind my bar.

07:02.976 --> 07:03.976
I got him.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.333
Got to deal with this.

07:05.417 --> 07:06.833
Fucking chuck town junkie.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.300
So.

07:15.325 --> 07:16.524
Ray.

07:17.208 --> 07:18.651
You calling me with
ten months to go.

07:18.676 --> 07:19.524
Cos what... ?

07:19.583 --> 07:20.583
You're bored?

07:21.500 --> 07:23.458
I really appreciate what you did for me but,

07:24.292 --> 07:26.792
- I need a little time.
- 50K, Ray.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.333
It's the going rate for judges.

07:29.417 --> 07:30.717
And time?

07:31.625 --> 07:33.708
No.
It's something you don't got.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.875
Don't..
Don't look like that alright.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.583
Since you went away.
I've been in business with some guys. It's...

07:43.083 --> 07:45.100
These chain saws.
Ray.

07:46.875 --> 07:49.050
Compared to them,
I am a fucking manitarian

07:50.917 --> 07:52.114
You know this painting?

07:52.139 --> 07:52.907
Yeah.

07:53.542 --> 07:54.742
Do it.

07:54.792 --> 07:56.375
Do it?
What do you mean, do it?

07:57.625 --> 07:59.250
You mean forge it?

08:02.333 --> 08:04.167
It's a Monet.
What the fuck for?

08:05.500 --> 08:07.383
So you can steal the real one.

08:08.292 --> 08:09.803
Steal?
What are you talking about?

08:09.828 --> 08:11.091
Steal the real one?

08:11.167 --> 08:12.667
In three weeks...

08:12.750 --> 08:14.625
It's going to be on display right here.

08:14.917 --> 08:17.750
And the guy who wants it.
He's going to be in Boston too.

08:17.875 --> 08:19.475
For one night only.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.142
That's impossible.

08:21.183 --> 08:23.767
Three weeks.
I can't do that.

08:23.850 --> 08:25.308
Look, it's either yes...

08:26.292 --> 08:27.633
Or I make a phone call.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.325
And you go back to prison.

08:30.333 --> 08:32.500
Yes or no.
You have 48 hours to make a decision.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.883
Welcome home, Ray.

08:42.167 --> 08:43.500
- Jesus!
- I'm so sorry.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.916
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

08:44.917 --> 08:47.083
Where are you going?
I have not seen you around here before.

08:47.167 --> 08:48.267
I'm Catherine.

08:48.292 --> 08:49.117
I'm Ray.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.458
Ray.
Nice to meet you Ray.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.042
Hey, you know Tommy?

08:52.417 --> 08:53.417
Tommy?

08:55.417 --> 08:56.417
Yeah.

08:56.792 --> 08:58.167
Well, I got to...

08:59.000 --> 09:00.250
Want to go somewhere?

09:02.458 --> 09:03.500
Oh, thank you.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.708
Wow, is this your car?

09:08.208 --> 09:09.208
So cool.

09:09.333 --> 09:10.750
Can I drop you off somewhere?

09:11.292 --> 09:12.403
- Drop me?
- Yeah.

09:12.708 --> 09:15.375
Yeah, I got things to do
and you don't want to be in there.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.156
Stay out of there.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.024
And stay away from Tommy Keegan.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.975
Okay.
There are better people and better places.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.125
Hey!

09:29.458 --> 09:30.783
Are you serious?

09:48.833 --> 09:49.833
Hey.

09:50.167 --> 09:51.367
You hungry?

09:53.750 --> 09:55.050
Not for those.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.333
Okay.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.700
Well, eggs it is.

10:11.542 --> 10:12.542
Where's gramps?

10:13.583 --> 10:15.833
He's out.
But I'm going to take you today.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.250
Because of it's location in the mid section

10:27.333 --> 10:28.567
of the brain stem.

10:28.650 --> 10:31.042
It makes it very difficult to remove surgically.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.583
I'm sorry, Mr. Cutter.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.725
I know this is difficult.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.042
- You have any questions?
- Yeah, I do.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.375
What do you do now?

10:41.450 --> 10:43.433
I mean.. you know.
What is the plan?

10:43.500 --> 10:44.576
- The plan?
- Yeah!

10:44.700 --> 10:47.417
Is he going to be in pain?
I mean, what's going to happen?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.708
What we should focus on is...

10:49.792 --> 10:53.083
Keeping William as comfortable as possible
during the process.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.383
Then what?

10:57.917 --> 11:00.833
Well you know it's..,
it's impossible to say.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.208
Each patient is very different.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.250
- So?
- So.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.508
So?
So what?

11:19.750 --> 11:21.050
What they say?

11:25.667 --> 11:26.808
Gramps took it out.

11:26.875 --> 11:28.075
He took it out?

11:28.167 --> 11:29.908
Why did he take it out?

11:30.167 --> 11:32.483
He hit it too many times.
Sprained his wrist.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.042
So, the chemo.
Will it cure me?

11:42.292 --> 11:44.292
- What the fuck he took it out for?
- Dad.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.700
Fuck.

11:46.917 --> 11:48.167
Will the chemo cure me?

11:48.976 --> 11:49.976
Oh, Will.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.942
Daddy, for once in your fucking life.
Can you just tell me the truth.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.875
I don't know.

12:38.851 --> 12:39.851
<i>Can I help you?</i>

12:39.875 --> 12:41.417
<i>I like to see the man in charge.</i>

12:42.125 --> 12:43.425
<i>In here.</i>

12:46.500 --> 12:48.000
Hey, gramps.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.467
Can I have one of those?

12:51.458 --> 12:53.208
<i>I want to report a murder.</i>

12:53.500 --> 12:54.800
<i>Sit down.</i>

12:57.208 --> 12:59.283
<i>The name's Bigelow, Frank Bigelow. </i> ?

13:02.250 --> 13:03.833
<i>Where was this murder committed?</i>

13:04.250 --> 13:06.008
<i>San Francisco. . Last night</i>

13:06.750 --> 13:08.417
<i>Who was murdered?</i>

13:11.500 --> 13:12.800
<i>I was</i>

13:14.708 --> 13:17.042
Sean Mcgill.
Lived in Cambridge.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.042
- 28 years old today.
- I knew him.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.017
Bartender at the Palace.

13:21.042 --> 13:23.550
Talked to him the night before last.
Watched him got fired.

13:24.333 --> 13:24.993
Finn Gerrity..

13:25.018 --> 13:27.232
Told him to walk.
Right when he came on shift.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.875
Like they caught him in something.
He looked scared.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.500
- Anyway we can this to Keegan?
- Love to.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.750
Alright, guys,
Come on in here and do your jobs.

13:34.833 --> 13:37.283
Get that new trace heroin to the lab,
see if we can match it.

13:37.667 --> 13:38.605
Do me a favour, won't you.

13:38.630 --> 13:40.624
Finger print the fuck
out of this place, huh.

13:40.833 --> 13:43.833
You know what's hard?
Relying on local law enforcement to connect the dots.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.350
Well, it's tough all over.
You want me to get you a tissue?

13:47.792 --> 13:49.283
What you want to to know?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.667
There's a guy.
Ray.

13:51.917 --> 13:53.542
Met with Keegan that night.

13:53.625 --> 13:57.167
Buick skylark, license plate 'J433K6'.

13:58.917 --> 14:00.667
Okay.
What's so special about this guy?

14:00.750 --> 14:02.375
I don't know.
Something.

14:03.417 --> 14:05.000
- I think he made me.
- Made you?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.208
Like..
DEA made you?

14:08.583 --> 14:10.633
- Just a cop.
- Oh, just a cop.

14:14.208 --> 14:15.908
You talked to Keegan?

14:18.167 --> 14:19.367
What did he want?

14:19.375 --> 14:21.333
One answer.
Tomorrow.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.867
About what?
About a job?

14:25.042 --> 14:26.042
Yeah.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.158
What do you want?

14:30.833 --> 14:32.333
What I want...

14:35.083 --> 14:36.667
What I've always wanted, Carl.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.408
Go to Tahiti and live like Gauguin.

14:40.292 --> 14:41.692
In Tahiti?

14:46.042 --> 14:47.742
What's Will want?

14:53.417 --> 14:55.017
I don't know.

15:07.250 --> 15:08.975
Hey, Will.
Check it out.

15:10.667 --> 15:11.950
Don't even think about it.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
What?

15:13.833 --> 15:14.733
You're not going to sign me

15:14.758 --> 15:15.691
up for something like that.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.850
- What? You don't want to meet nobody?
- No.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.082
I don't want to meet at all.

15:19.107 --> 15:21.232
Or go to Disneyland,
or meet Tom Brady.

15:21.375 --> 15:22.375
Why not?

15:22.458 --> 15:24.625
Because dad, it's embarrassing.
What's the point?

15:25.042 --> 15:26.458
What?
You don't want to do anything?

15:26.542 --> 15:28.042
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

15:28.125 --> 15:30.000
Hi, handsome.
You been waiting long?

15:30.542 --> 15:32.042
No, not long.

15:42.667 --> 15:43.967
What if I did that?

15:45.542 --> 15:46.792
Dad, just dropped it.

15:47.101 --> 15:48.101
No, I mean it.

15:48.125 --> 15:51.125
What if you..
you made a wish.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.708
You could even make like three wishes.
Like a genie.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.208
Dad, a genie?

15:55.292 --> 15:56.875
You are not a genie.
Jesus Christ.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.125
No, seriously.
Will.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.333
You make..
make any.. anything.

16:02.417 --> 16:03.800
Anything you want.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.408
Like you would follow through with it.

16:09.458 --> 16:11.542
What do you know?
I might surprise you.

16:11.708 --> 16:13.092
Give me a chance.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.050
Alright then.

16:15.633 --> 16:16.783
You know what I wish for?

16:16.808 --> 16:18.324
I wished I didn't have cancer.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.550
Is that fair?

16:27.875 --> 16:30.933
I do not know, dad, you tell me.
You're the genius, right?

16:46.875 --> 16:49.775
Look at you.
I think those girls were checking you out.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.175
Dad, stop.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.092
They are like 20 something.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.625
I was just joking.

16:59.292 --> 17:01.458
So, you have a girlfriend, right?

17:01.583 --> 17:03.833
Like Tracy.. or Trixie..
or something like that.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.259
How do you know about her?

17:07.284 --> 17:08.340
Gramps

17:08.375 --> 17:10.875
I asked about you all the time
when I was away.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.567
You talking about Tricia?

17:19.500 --> 17:20.992
Yeah, Tricia.. You're...

17:21.017 --> 17:23.491
How long did you
go out with her?

17:24.666 --> 17:25.666
Dad...

17:25.750 --> 17:27.349
Dropped it huh.

17:28.458 --> 17:31.325
I got to go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.698
Look, my son is
sitting over there.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.607
If you could, give him
anything he wants.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.250
And I'll have a cheese burger and a coffee.

17:48.833 --> 17:51.633
- Guess what today is, Cutter?
- I know what day it is.

17:51.875 --> 17:54.167
Now look.
I'm having lunch with my son.

17:54.833 --> 17:56.427
So why don't you
just tell Tommy.

17:56.452 --> 17:57.957
That I'll see him later okay?

17:58.208 --> 17:59.633
I have not forgotten.

17:59.708 --> 18:01.108
Fuck you, Cutter.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.667
So whose the guy you followed into the bathroom?

18:16.750 --> 18:17.750
What guy?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.242
Dad, I saw you followed the guy in there.

18:20.750 --> 18:23.000
Hamburger, no onions and a grilled cheese.

18:23.042 --> 18:23.992
Anything else you need?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.417
No, that's it.
Thanks.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.083
Grilled cheese, that's all?

18:28.917 --> 18:30.217
- Yeah
- Why?

18:30.250 --> 18:31.250
Dad, I don't know.

18:31.292 --> 18:32.533
My stomach hurts.

18:32.542 --> 18:33.842
Don't worry about it.

18:35.792 --> 18:37.832
So you really not going to tell me who the guy was?

18:40.500 --> 18:43.301
I owe his boss money and he came to remind me.
That's it.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.700
How much you owe him?

18:47.583 --> 18:49.583
You know,
I really don't want to burden you with this stuff.

18:49.667 --> 18:51.283
Dad, I don't care.
You can tell me.

18:51.292 --> 18:53.892
I don't see why you're so scared
to tell me things.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.283
Fifty grand.
Okay.

18:57.417 --> 18:59.333
- Holy shit, fifty thousand dollars?
- Yeah.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.642
How did you owe him 50 thousands dollars?
For what?

19:09.167 --> 19:11.399
Because we had to pay
the judge to bride him.

19:11.424 --> 19:13.224
In order to get out early, so...

19:16.250 --> 19:19.175
So I can spend some time with you.

19:41.583 --> 19:43.792
I want to meet my mother.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.075
What?

19:47.792 --> 19:49.533
I want to meet my mother.

19:49.801 --> 19:50.901
Your mother?

19:50.925 --> 19:51.824
Yeah, dad.

19:51.849 --> 19:54.166
Yeah I want to meet her.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.543
- Oh jee, Will...
- Am I talking to the genie or what?

19:59.625 --> 20:01.208
But I don't know where she is.

20:01.292 --> 20:03.750
I thought you said she moved away,
to that fancy condo.

20:03.833 --> 20:06.325
Yeah, exactly .
You know.. the condo, right.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.800
Okay then.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.292
That's my first wish.

20:20.542 --> 20:21.942
Agent Paisley.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.792
I got your guy.
Raymond Cutter

20:24.000 --> 20:25.417
Five years forgery.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.833
Fresh out of Northport.
Ten months early for good behavior.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.625
Forgery?
You don't hear that everyday.

20:29.708 --> 20:32.375
You do not.
Busted back in '87 for art fraud.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.071
And then nothing, until someone
dropped a dime on him.

20:34.096 --> 20:34.999
Who?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.400
Tommy Keegan.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.850
That's right.
Your bad guy.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.208
They say Cutter took the fall.

20:41.417 --> 20:42.500
The Buick...

20:42.583 --> 20:45.417
Is registered to his dad,
Joseph Cutter.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.333
Old school conman, pickpocket, petty thief.

20:48.417 --> 20:50.583
He stretches up and down the east coast .

20:50.708 --> 20:52.708
Buy me a drink and
I'll read you his rap sheet.

20:52.792 --> 20:53.885
And Keegan is a felon.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.342
So Cutter violated his parole when
he went visited him.

20:56.425 --> 20:57.542
You want to bring him in?

20:57.625 --> 20:59.667
No.
I want to watch him.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.042
Who is the buyer?

21:08.125 --> 21:10.508
Buyer?
There is no buyer.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.167
He's just a guy...

21:13.375 --> 21:14.758
And he wants it.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.569
I got to pay for a
fucking what is it?

21:17.594 --> 21:18.824
Appraiser.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.425
Do you believe in that shit?

21:20.458 --> 21:22.175
Making me pay.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.250
I don't know...

21:25.042 --> 21:26.583
You know any?

21:27.250 --> 21:28.592
For stolen art?

21:28.667 --> 21:29.967
Yeah.

21:30.458 --> 21:31.758
Legit?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.567
I don't know.
Maybe...

21:36.042 --> 21:38.250
Maybe Owensby,
from Minnesota.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.533
Something like that.

21:39.625 --> 21:40.825
Minnesota...

21:40.968 --> 21:42.268
So, how much?

21:42.292 --> 21:43.633
Nothing, Ray.

21:45.042 --> 21:48.083
I'm getting you out of a jam,
and you getting me out of one.

21:49.083 --> 21:51.125
Do you want to go back to prison?

21:51.750 --> 21:53.533
Or you want just to do this thing?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.083
What do you want?

22:04.208 --> 22:07.033
I'll need a painting of the same year.

22:07.458 --> 22:08.758
Same size.

22:09.583 --> 22:11.708
And uh.
When I find it.

22:13.417 --> 22:14.191
Whatever it cost.

22:14.216 --> 22:16.299
You got to be ready
to pay for it.

22:20.167 --> 22:22.642
Yeah, yeah.
This is Ronald Chambers.

22:23.292 --> 22:24.492
Chambers .

22:25.000 --> 22:27.133
Yeah, I'm looking for something specific

22:27.458 --> 22:29.200
I'm looking for something French.

22:29.250 --> 22:31.050
Circle 1875.

22:32.042 --> 22:33.725
40 inches by 32 inches.

22:33.792 --> 22:35.092
Let's go, boy.

22:35.542 --> 22:37.167
No, that doesn't matter,
doesn't matter.

22:37.208 --> 22:40.208
It's period and size.

22:42.167 --> 22:43.467
Hey, gramp.

22:43.750 --> 22:44.917
What was grandma like?

22:45.583 --> 22:47.200
Your grandmother was a Saint.

22:47.625 --> 22:50.200
She never lies,
she never gossip.

22:50.792 --> 22:54.467
And she give you the last ..
dime in her pocket.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.200
I don't know...

22:57.292 --> 22:59.742
She didn't deserved to suffer her life with me,
I tell you.

22:59.792 --> 23:01.100
Jesus Christ!

23:03.125 --> 23:05.792
- How old was dad when she died?
- Four.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.842
So, it's just you two then.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.200
You guys get along?

23:12.250 --> 23:14.100
What kind of a question is that?

23:14.667 --> 23:16.325
I just..
just wondering.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.083
Wondering..
wondering why?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.417
I don't know, I guess
I've never see you guys hug or...

23:23.625 --> 23:25.367
Or say you love each other.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.300
Yeah, I don't do that.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.667
But he knows.

23:31.101 --> 23:32.101
You sure?

23:32.125 --> 23:35.000
I didn't tell your grandmother either,
but she knew.

23:35.500 --> 23:39.000
Why?
Because words don't mean a shit in this world. Will.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.200
It's what a person does feel that counts.

23:47.875 --> 23:48.675
Well.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.000
What about my mother?

23:50.250 --> 23:51.250
You ever meet her?

23:51.458 --> 23:54.608
Oh, that's what this is all about.
Is it?

23:55.333 --> 23:56.333
Yeah.

23:57.208 --> 23:59.900
Sad asked me what I wanted
and I told him...

24:00.542 --> 24:02.363
I want to meet my mother.

24:02.458 --> 24:03.708
Yeah?
Well, fuck that.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.500
Get in the car.

24:09.583 --> 24:12.375
All I know is that one of Keegans' guys
got busted.

24:12.667 --> 24:14.417
Lost an entire load of H.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.458
Now Tommy owes someone.

24:16.750 --> 24:17.750
Who?

24:18.708 --> 24:19.708
I don't know.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.750
But that's a lot of dope.

24:23.375 --> 24:25.458
Any fucking idea what you are doing?

24:26.625 --> 24:27.475
No.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.549
Oh.

24:30.208 --> 24:31.208
Good.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.458
Hey.

24:38.684 --> 24:39.684
Uncle Carl.

24:39.708 --> 24:40.708
Hey, Will.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.767
How you're doing, buddy?

24:42.917 --> 24:44.208
- Alright.
- Good to see you.

24:44.333 --> 24:45.042
Alright, alright.

24:45.333 --> 24:46.875
You, upstairs.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.025
You, get into the wind.

24:49.167 --> 24:50.667
You, out back.

24:50.917 --> 24:51.756
Call me tomorrow.

24:51.781 --> 24:52.274
Why?

24:52.333 --> 24:53.633
Out back!

24:54.633 --> 24:55.833
So.

24:56.258 --> 24:57.558
What are you doing?

24:57.583 --> 24:59.842
Promising that he can see his mother.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.458
Well, how do you think he is going to feel
if you don't deliver?

25:02.792 --> 25:04.333
And god forbid if you do.

25:04.417 --> 25:05.350
Bullshit!

25:05.417 --> 25:07.167
Whatever you are going to say is bullshit!

25:09.867 --> 25:11.875
Four years we've been here, Ray.

25:12.792 --> 25:14.292
Me and Will.

25:14.292 --> 25:15.892
And we are doing fine.

25:16.083 --> 25:18.542
And you come catapulting out of prison.

25:18.792 --> 25:20.092
Jesus!

25:21.000 --> 25:22.842
You tell me the truth.

25:23.417 --> 25:25.200
How did you get out.

25:28.083 --> 25:29.283
Keegan.

25:29.375 --> 25:31.092
Oh, fuck me.

25:31.833 --> 25:32.875
Tell me you're lying.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.167
Tell me you're not in it for
Tommy fucking Keegan!

25:36.250 --> 25:38.542
Jesus, Mary and me!

25:38.833 --> 25:39.833
How much?

25:39.917 --> 25:42.167
How much in it for him?
Don't, don't, don't..

25:43.042 --> 25:44.325
Don't tell me.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.217
I don't want to her it.

25:46.726 --> 25:47.726
Go.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.275
Take Will and...

25:49.417 --> 25:51.350
Get the fuck out of town.

25:54.333 --> 25:56.333
I need your help, pop.

25:56.458 --> 25:58.058
You know something?

26:02.333 --> 26:04.592
You should have stayed inside.

26:43.375 --> 26:44.375
It's closed, man.

26:44.458 --> 26:45.875
Rodney, remember me?

26:46.351 --> 26:47.351
Ray.

26:47.375 --> 26:48.375
No.

26:48.542 --> 26:49.542
Kim's ex.

26:51.208 --> 26:52.250
What the fuck do you want?

26:52.417 --> 26:54.000
I need to know where she is.

26:54.024 --> 26:54.791
No.

26:54.792 --> 26:55.992
I haven't seen her.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.667
Oh come on,
you know where she is.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.042
Told you, Ray.

26:59.292 --> 27:01.458
I haven't see that fucking bitch in years.

27:01.833 --> 27:04.000
Look, Rodney.
I not here to cause any trouble.

27:04.042 --> 27:06.000
- Are you here to cause any trouble?
- I just wanna know where she is.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.708
Come on.
This ain't the kind of night, is it.

27:07.742 --> 27:10.417
Hey!
Get this guy out of my fucking shop!

27:10.500 --> 27:11.917
- Give me a fucking break.
- Get the fuck out, Ray.

27:11.941 --> 27:13.441
Let's go buddy.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.008
Never liked you, Ray!

27:20.032 --> 27:22.032
Never liked you!

27:51.000 --> 27:52.708
Come on!
I'm going to get you!

28:03.167 --> 28:04.167
Fuck!

28:09.591 --> 28:11.291
Fucking fucker.

28:12.092 --> 28:12.784
Where?

28:12.809 --> 28:13.809
Fuck you!

28:13.833 --> 28:14.479
Last time.

28:14.504 --> 28:15.149
Where?

28:15.351 --> 28:16.351
Fuck you!

28:16.375 --> 28:18.658
That's it.
I'm not asking again.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.625
You want Ray in your fucking forehead?

28:20.708 --> 28:21.708
Fuck off!

28:22.792 --> 28:24.292
- I'm going to ask you again.
- Fuck you!

28:24.292 --> 28:25.642
- Fuck!
- Where?

28:27.042 --> 28:28.542
Prescott road!

28:28.833 --> 28:30.233
It's in Braintree.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.500
That's where she is,
I swear.

28:32.167 --> 28:33.667
I do..

29:47.042 --> 29:48.758
How did you find me?

29:48.833 --> 29:49.458
Rodney.

29:49.667 --> 29:50.667
Fuck.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.117
That was easy.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.775
Not really.

29:59.292 --> 30:00.692
What do you want?

30:01.458 --> 30:02.354
Your son,
Will.

30:02.379 --> 30:03.691
He wants to see you.

30:07.208 --> 30:09.067
What is he now?
12?

30:09.125 --> 30:10.425
Try 15.

30:13.875 --> 30:15.617
Does he remember me?

30:18.000 --> 30:18.886
I mean what?

30:18.911 --> 30:20.967
All the sudden he
wants to see me?

30:21.500 --> 30:23.000
This isn't you ...

30:23.042 --> 30:25.658
- Trying to hook me back into you and your dad...
- Your son is sick.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.150
He's got cancer.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.688
He's got a stage 4
tumor in his head.

30:29.713 --> 30:30.925
Okay.

30:32.375 --> 30:34.425
So I need you to clean yourself up.

30:34.792 --> 30:36.600
Put your best face on.

30:36.625 --> 30:38.683
And have lunch with us on Wednesday.

30:38.750 --> 30:39.375
I can't do that.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.875
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

30:41.208 --> 30:43.768
Wait a minute, I just told you that
your son is dying.

30:44.125 --> 30:45.375
And you say,
you can't do this?

30:46.700 --> 30:48.000
Who are you?

30:48.875 --> 30:49.875
You are going to do this.

30:50.042 --> 30:51.680
Or I'm going to make
your fucking life

30:51.705 --> 30:53.374
more miserable than
it already is.

30:53.750 --> 30:56.192
I'll be back at noon.
You be ready.

31:02.375 --> 31:03.775
Hold... hold still now.

31:05.583 --> 31:07.167
Oh, did it hurt, Ray?

31:07.458 --> 31:09.425
- Just get on with it, will you.
- Heh, heh.

31:10.458 --> 31:12.150
Will you be needing a tissue?

31:13.667 --> 31:15.167
Are you done?

31:15.333 --> 31:16.925
Yeah, done.

31:17.583 --> 31:18.583
So.

31:19.292 --> 31:20.592
It was Keegan.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.408
Rodney.

31:23.792 --> 31:25.378
Oh..Christ,

31:25.403 --> 31:26.741
Ray.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.800
I'm sorry, dad.

31:36.417 --> 31:38.017
You were right.

31:39.167 --> 31:40.467
Alright.

31:40.875 --> 31:42.467
What can I do?

31:43.583 --> 31:44.983
Is Will okay?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.100
He's sleeping.

31:46.167 --> 31:48.667
It was a tough night for the Cutter boys.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.542
What do you need?

31:52.833 --> 31:54.133
Ivan.

31:54.208 --> 31:55.948
He still in business?

31:56.042 --> 31:57.242
Ivan?

31:57.875 --> 31:59.375
Of course, he is.

31:59.458 --> 32:01.292
That rusky is like a cockroach.

32:01.316 --> 32:03.816
- Heh, heh...
- Heh..

32:06.325 --> 32:08.650
And here he comes..

32:08.726 --> 32:09.726
Swing..!

32:09.750 --> 32:11.050
A hit.

32:13.274 --> 32:14.774
Oh man.

32:15.292 --> 32:16.333
Whose the victim?

32:16.417 --> 32:17.125
Rodney Hunter.

32:17.208 --> 32:18.000
Three time loser .

32:18.083 --> 32:21.292
Spouse abuse, identity fraud
and possession of methamphetamine.

32:21.833 --> 32:23.083
What's he got to say about this?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Nothing.

32:25.167 --> 32:27.466
According to Mr. Hunter,
your Raymond Cutter was

32:27.491 --> 32:29.342
looking for someone
they had in common.

32:29.351 --> 32:30.351
Who?

32:30.375 --> 32:31.042
His ex-wife.

32:31.208 --> 32:32.208
Kim o'Halloran.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.467
I'm running her down now.
But so far..

32:35.375 --> 32:39.833
Your boy has violated his parole like
one, two... five counts now.

32:42.542 --> 32:43.867
What do you want to do?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.658
I want to know why.

32:48.042 --> 32:49.042
Here.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.800
Yeah, that's her.

32:54.042 --> 32:55.975
So why is she got such a hot on
for you anyway.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.075
No, it's Keegan she wants.

32:58.792 --> 33:01.717
She just saw me come out of his office
and probably thought i was...

33:01.875 --> 33:04.617
You know.
Hanging with another felon and shit.

33:05.583 --> 33:07.150
If Rodney dropped the dime on me.

33:07.167 --> 33:08.167
Fucked!

33:08.458 --> 33:09.698
I don't got time for this.

33:09.792 --> 33:10.617
Yeah.

33:10.667 --> 33:12.683
Come on.
I want to show you something.

33:16.083 --> 33:18.542
You know a lot of these old buildings
have hidden rooms left over

33:18.625 --> 33:19.333
from the proper vision.

33:19.417 --> 33:22.183
You can't even get to them
from the inside.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.800
Wicked cool, huh?

33:40.833 --> 33:42.133
It's good

33:43.792 --> 33:45.083
It's a stupid plan.

33:46.417 --> 33:47.717
What part?

33:47.825 --> 33:49.167
No, I'm serious.

33:49.250 --> 33:51.250
What makes you think
you can pull it off?

33:51.333 --> 33:53.250
You've not painted anything for fucking years.

33:54.143 --> 33:55.143
You're right, I haven't.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.000
But it doesn't mean I ever wanted to.

33:57.833 --> 33:58.852
In fact, up till now,

33:58.877 --> 34:01.066
it's the only thing I
ever thought about.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.175
Are you good?

34:05.542 --> 34:06.842
Let's go.

34:14.625 --> 34:15.789
Can you tell Ivan that..

34:15.790 --> 34:18.375
Joseph Cutter is here
to see him, please?

34:18.875 --> 34:19.875
Ivan is not here.

34:20.917 --> 34:22.117
Oh yeah, he is.

34:22.208 --> 34:23.817
I watched him come back from the deli.

34:23.942 --> 34:25.042
He's back there right now.

34:25.125 --> 34:27.750
Feeding his fat face,
with a fucking corn beef sandwich.

34:28.083 --> 34:29.375
Take a walk old man.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.600
Tell you what.

34:30.833 --> 34:31.833
If I win.

34:32.833 --> 34:34.283
Take me to Ivan.

34:34.750 --> 34:36.250
If uh,
you win.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.400
You got this.

34:40.083 --> 34:42.125
- Alright.
- On the count of three.

34:43.833 --> 34:44.833
One

34:45.650 --> 34:46.650
Two.

34:46.917 --> 34:47.917
Three.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.800
Son of a bitch.

34:54.583 --> 34:56.750
I told you never to come in here again, Cutter.

34:56.833 --> 35:00.583
I just happened to have in my possession
a little shopping list.

35:01.042 --> 35:03.292
You see I'm not selling.
I'm buying.

35:03.583 --> 35:06.375
Your services as a procurement specialist.

35:06.542 --> 35:09.667
You know, scrounger,
king fucking rat.

35:12.792 --> 35:14.133
Copper acetate.

35:14.559 --> 35:15.559
Cadmium.

35:15.583 --> 35:16.908
Arsenic sulfide.

35:16.958 --> 35:18.017
Cinnabar...

35:18.333 --> 35:20.042
What the fuck?
These are chemicals.

35:20.167 --> 35:21.167
And minerals.

35:21.542 --> 35:23.775
And a lot of them fucking poisonous .

35:24.500 --> 35:25.900
Read it carefully.

35:26.300 --> 35:27.992
We're got to need it all,

35:28.083 --> 35:29.833
and we need it quick.

35:33.625 --> 35:34.925
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:35.208 --> 35:36.208
Ronald Chambers.

35:36.250 --> 35:37.892
- Oh, dude! Awesome.
-Yeah.

35:38.117 --> 35:39.207
Great to meet you.

35:39.267 --> 35:40.167
Yeah, wow.

35:40.208 --> 35:41.833
Yeah, I'm gutting the place.

35:41.917 --> 35:43.000
It was my grandparents'.

35:43.042 --> 35:44.250
Oh.
And now it's yours?

35:44.333 --> 35:45.633
Now, it's mine.

35:53.167 --> 35:54.467
It's epic.

35:56.333 --> 35:59.575
This guy was an inventor.

36:00.250 --> 36:01.758
He was a philosopher.

36:02.792 --> 36:05.675
He was a..
patron of the arts...

36:06.458 --> 36:08.250
Not a good painter.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.300
But he's friend with Degas.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.317
- No shit!
- No shit.

36:15.292 --> 36:17.283
So, how much for the bad one?

36:18.667 --> 36:19.667
This one?

36:20.375 --> 36:21.375
That one.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.583
Would you look at this?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.800
What am I looking at?
Paper fucking numbers?

36:29.875 --> 36:33.575
Evidence.
From Cutter's 1987 conviction.

36:34.083 --> 36:36.917
Most of the stuff were auctioned off as lesser
unknown pieces by Paul Gauguin,

36:37.125 --> 36:38.717
except for this one.

36:39.583 --> 36:41.333
Which is in a museum in Paris.

36:41.583 --> 36:43.000
So, so why would he forged it?

36:43.025 --> 36:43.874
And like..

36:43.875 --> 36:45.458
Why would someone steal a famous painting?

36:45.542 --> 36:48.075
You can't.. sell it.
You can't exactly show it to people.

36:48.125 --> 36:49.225
Status.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.375
Look at this.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.583
Raul Carlos, head of the arroyo cartel.

36:52.875 --> 36:55.006
It is reported to have
the largest private art collection

36:55.031 --> 36:56.715
in Latin America.

36:56.750 --> 36:59.992
You think that Keegan and Cutter
are trying to run a scam on your boy?

37:00.042 --> 37:01.042
Scam?

37:02.750 --> 37:04.283
Carlos is a bad guy.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.800
I sure as hell wouldn't.

39:43.292 --> 39:44.492
Kim?

39:46.417 --> 39:47.717
You up?

39:50.025 --> 39:51.733
Mother fucker!

40:01.708 --> 40:02.708
So?

40:12.917 --> 40:14.217
You look nice.

40:28.875 --> 40:29.875
You coming in?

40:29.917 --> 40:30.917
No.

40:31.125 --> 40:32.767
I think you should.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.300
Well, Kim.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.542
Just look at you.

40:50.167 --> 40:51.567
- Look at you.
- Pops

40:56.292 --> 40:57.248
Hi.

40:57.849 --> 40:59.275
Hi.

41:02.167 --> 41:03.717
Okay, we should go.

41:04.250 --> 41:05.550
- Yeah
- Let's go.

41:16.516 --> 41:17.516
So uh.

41:17.542 --> 41:19.317
Where in New York do you live?

41:21.242 --> 41:23.233
Right near Times Square.

41:29.125 --> 41:31.005
I hope you're not a Yankees fan.

41:31.092 --> 41:33.092
Ha!
Not really.

41:33.442 --> 41:34.063
Good.

41:34.064 --> 41:36.533
Cos I don't know if I could be your son any more
if you were.

41:44.125 --> 41:45.325
So..

41:48.083 --> 41:49.933
Do you have a girlfriend?

41:52.875 --> 41:54.075
No.

42:05.125 --> 42:06.758
Excuse me a minute.

42:37.625 --> 42:38.925
You okay?

42:39.417 --> 42:40.542
- What?
- You okay?

42:40.750 --> 42:41.750
Yeah.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.500
You like her?

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Yeah.

42:46.083 --> 42:47.383
She's nice.

43:21.575 --> 43:22.875
I'm starving.

43:22.917 --> 43:23.917
What's good here?

43:24.417 --> 43:25.667
The grill salmon is good.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.792
Is that what you are getting?

43:28.917 --> 43:29.917
I think so.

43:30.583 --> 43:33.192
That's what I'll have too.

43:34.917 --> 43:36.217
Okay.

43:53.375 --> 43:54.375
So...

43:54.583 --> 43:55.750
What's New York like?

43:56.042 --> 43:57.917
Like Boston, only bigger.

43:59.542 --> 44:01.317
No one,
drives.

44:01.750 --> 44:04.075
Everyone takes a taxi or the subway.

44:04.542 --> 44:06.083
So do you live in a nice building?

44:06.250 --> 44:07.550
I like it.

44:08.167 --> 44:10.250
- We have a game room.
- Nice.

44:11.083 --> 44:13.767
- A hot tub on the roof.
- Oh wow.

44:16.583 --> 44:18.050
I would love to see that.

44:18.125 --> 44:20.283
When you get better, you should come visit.

44:20.583 --> 44:21.750
Yeah.
Yeah.

44:23.083 --> 44:24.083
I will.

44:37.250 --> 44:39.092
These are really hot.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.400
Thank you, sir.

44:52.825 --> 44:54.125
Pretzel.

44:56.792 --> 44:58.492
Here you go.

45:12.075 --> 45:13.375
Dip in.

45:18.417 --> 45:20.300
Wish you won't going so soon.

45:20.925 --> 45:22.517
Wish you could stay longer.

45:25.417 --> 45:27.000
So.
Why aren't you flying?

45:27.017 --> 45:27.835
Ha ha.

45:27.836 --> 45:31.308
You don't have wings, you
got to get in a plane.

45:35.083 --> 45:36.583
Goodbye, William.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.017
I had a really great day.

45:39.333 --> 45:40.933
Yeah.
Me too.

46:00.542 --> 46:01.942
Wait here.

46:20.542 --> 46:21.842
Thanks.

46:27.125 --> 46:28.325
Okay.

46:28.917 --> 46:30.833
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46:39.917 --> 46:41.317
She is nice.

46:43.917 --> 46:45.608
- She was nice, dad..
- Yeah

46:46.542 --> 46:47.942
Yeah, I told you.

46:54.833 --> 46:56.817
Thanks.
Thanks for pretending.

46:57.750 --> 46:59.800
What do you mean pretending?
Pretending what?

47:00.292 --> 47:01.792
Yeah, you know.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.600
About her
living in New York and ...

47:05.642 --> 47:08.075
not being a drug addict.

47:14.750 --> 47:17.000
Glad I got to meet her.

47:31.500 --> 47:32.500
You okay?

47:32.583 --> 47:33.583
Yeah.

47:33.625 --> 47:34.625
Feeling sick?

47:34.708 --> 47:35.708
No, I'm fine.

47:35.733 --> 47:37.233
Just.
You know.

47:37.833 --> 47:39.375
Gramps breakfast.

47:41.542 --> 47:43.233
- We ready to go?
- Yeah.

47:44.792 --> 47:45.792
What it feels like?

47:45.875 --> 47:46.500
What?

47:46.792 --> 47:48.092
The chemo.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.592
I don't know.
It feels like shit.

47:58.792 --> 47:59.992
You okay?

48:02.042 --> 48:03.842
What's going on?

48:08.417 --> 48:09.617
Alright.

48:11.292 --> 48:13.825
Promise
you're not going to laugh.

48:14.208 --> 48:15.908
I'm not going to laugh.

48:21.500 --> 48:23.200
I want to have sex.

48:25.792 --> 48:27.792
That's my second wish.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.250
So the bad news is that
they got the gallery mast up.

48:44.500 --> 48:47.000
They got wireless sensors on
all the doors and windows...

48:47.167 --> 48:49.141
And each painting is
equipped with a battery..

48:49.142 --> 48:51.708
..operated magnetic sensor
behind the frame.

48:52.083 --> 48:54.100
If it is moved.
The detector sets off an alarm...

48:54.183 --> 48:57.825
And we are looking like a
six minutes response time.

48:57.917 --> 49:00.867
And they send their alarm signal
directly to the cops.

49:01.375 --> 49:03.408
The whole thing is keypad controlled.

49:03.583 --> 49:05.458
Oh keypads,
just call pops.

49:05.542 --> 49:06.542
Yeah,
roger that.

49:07.208 --> 49:08.925
How about security guards?
How about that?

49:09.000 --> 49:10.167
Five at night.

49:10.250 --> 49:11.083
Top of the hour.

49:11.167 --> 49:13.467
They do rounds on foot
after they locked up.

49:14.875 --> 49:16.417
Okay, so what's the good news?

49:16.742 --> 49:17.742
Oh.

49:21.417 --> 49:23.242
Here.
Call in advance.

49:23.458 --> 49:26.000
Ask for Melanie.
She will take good care of Will.

49:26.125 --> 49:27.783
- Where did you get this?
- You know, it's online.

49:27.867 --> 49:30.133
It's a site like Yelp,
but for hookers.

49:30.142 --> 49:31.642
No, no, no...
Forget it.

49:31.875 --> 49:33.833
There's got to be a better way than that.

49:34.542 --> 49:36.875
If there is, you be sure to let me know
okay.

49:37.833 --> 49:39.083
What do you want him to do, Ray?

49:39.417 --> 49:42.000
Meet some girl,
and take her out on a date.

49:42.250 --> 49:44.417
Maybe fall in love,
meet the family.

49:45.083 --> 49:46.500
Some day have sex.

49:46.583 --> 49:49.958
In the back seat of the Buick,
on the banks of the Charles (river)?

49:51.000 --> 49:52.375
Yeah, Carl.
I do.

49:55.583 --> 49:57.333
Alright.
Thanks.

50:24.042 --> 50:25.708
Six parole violations.

50:25.792 --> 50:29.067
And now he is taking a minor
to a whore house.

50:29.125 --> 50:30.325
You know at this point, if..

50:30.792 --> 50:33.658
we don't fucking arrest him,
then we aren't doing our jobs.

50:34.625 --> 50:36.208
So uh.
This Melanie,

50:36.292 --> 50:37.333
She is a friend of Carl's?

50:37.625 --> 50:38.625
Yeah.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.200
You okay?

50:40.833 --> 50:42.333
You got any questions?

50:42.792 --> 50:44.092
I don't think so.

50:44.292 --> 50:45.292
No?

50:45.792 --> 50:47.367
Just remember what I said,
you know.

50:47.417 --> 50:49.833
Wear your raincoat.
No fancy stuff.

50:51.500 --> 50:52.792
2C,
2D...

50:53.625 --> 50:54.750
2B.
Here we go.

50:57.667 --> 50:58.667
Melissa?

50:58.917 --> 50:59.583
Melanie.

50:59.667 --> 51:00.057
Melanie.

51:00.058 --> 51:01.475
Yeah. Come on in.

51:01.500 --> 51:03.200
Carl explained everything.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.117
So, you must be William.
Hi.

51:08.150 --> 51:09.317
Hi.

51:11.458 --> 51:13.492
We're fine.
We'll see you in an hour.

51:14.750 --> 51:15.750
Okay.

51:16.250 --> 51:18.167
- Okay... good
- Okay.

51:45.708 --> 51:47.000
Will, open up!

51:48.125 --> 51:49.417
Hey, what..
Everythings fine.

51:49.500 --> 51:51.492
I'm sorry, we got to go.
The cops are here.

51:51.500 --> 51:53.067
Look.
Here's your money.

51:53.542 --> 51:55.792
They're going to ask me questions,
I can't answer.

52:04.083 --> 52:06.117
I got this.
Go, go, go.

52:07.625 --> 52:09.000
Left.
Left.

52:09.667 --> 52:11.458
Go up.
Up, up, up.

52:26.100 --> 52:27.883
Oh.
Fuck.

52:28.375 --> 52:29.500
Dad, dad
let's jump over.

52:29.583 --> 52:31.208
No, we can't jump.
We're not jumping.

52:31.292 --> 52:32.750
Dad, what?
What are you, scare?

52:32.833 --> 52:34.375
You can't..
You can't..

52:34.458 --> 52:35.791
You don't think I can make it?

52:35.792 --> 52:37.700
Let me..
Let me find the fire escape.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.175
Come on.

52:53.750 --> 52:55.250
Shit.
Oh.

53:18.083 --> 53:19.692
A whore house.

53:22.333 --> 53:23.375
Why are you laughing?

53:24.167 --> 53:26.058
Gramps.
It's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

53:26.142 --> 53:28.717
Well, that's what it's supposed to be.
Heh, heh, heh...

53:29.250 --> 53:30.417
No, no.
Gramps.

53:30.833 --> 53:32.458
We jumped to a whole another building.

53:32.542 --> 53:33.583
On the top of the roof.

53:33.667 --> 53:35.708
And then
he picks the lock.

53:35.767 --> 53:38.392
And I'm so nervous,
my stomach was just doing somersault.

53:38.875 --> 53:39.875
But him...

53:40.583 --> 53:41.580
He's so calm.

53:41.581 --> 53:43.042
No, I wasn't calm on the inside.

53:43.167 --> 53:46.742
So, you never got ..
You never got to finish it.

53:46.875 --> 53:47.875
Hey, pop, pop!

53:48.250 --> 53:51.000
Why don't you go call Carl
and have him pick up the Buick.

53:51.083 --> 53:53.083
Alright.
And then what?

53:54.250 --> 53:56.583
Go walk the imaginary dog or
some other fucking thing.

53:56.875 --> 53:59.667
- If you wanted time to be alone together
- You're too much.

53:59.692 --> 54:01.416
Fucking take it.

54:01.417 --> 54:04.625
No need to patronize me,
you.. fucker.

54:04.833 --> 54:06.667
Oh,
you're too much.

54:09.875 --> 54:11.000
Hey, Will.

54:11.292 --> 54:12.708
I'm sorry about Melanie.

54:13.917 --> 54:15.317
You kidding me?

54:16.208 --> 54:17.208
Dad...

54:18.333 --> 54:19.792
Today was awesome.

54:20.042 --> 54:20.767
Yeah?

54:20.833 --> 54:22.033
Yeah!

54:31.208 --> 54:33.458
How come you broke up with that girl?

54:34.208 --> 54:35.708
- Tricia?
- Yeah.

54:39.917 --> 54:43.525
She would smile at every guy
that walked past her.

54:43.617 --> 54:44.712
And it ..

54:45.813 --> 54:47.867
It just, you know
drove me nuts.

54:48.250 --> 54:50.542
But that's. That's it?
She just smiled ?

54:51.167 --> 54:53.042
She's trying to make me jealous or something.

54:53.043 --> 54:54.599
But.. but..

54:54.625 --> 54:57.383
What if she is just friendly?

54:58.250 --> 55:00.142
Why don't you just call her?

55:07.950 --> 55:09.925
The kid.
It's his son.

55:12.125 --> 55:13.425
William.

55:13.492 --> 55:16.166
Cutter took him out of school,
the day after he got out of prison.

55:16.167 --> 55:17.200
Ask me why.

55:18.375 --> 55:19.542
Okay, why?

55:20.167 --> 55:21.167
Medical.

55:22.042 --> 55:23.908
William Cutter got cancer.

55:24.500 --> 55:25.800
Jesus.

55:28.167 --> 55:31.725
Lab test result on the trace heroin
found on the dead bartender's hotel room.

55:32.125 --> 55:34.992
Spoiler alert.
Matches the shit you are after.

55:38.167 --> 55:39.333
Okay.
Um..

55:40.008 --> 55:42.382
Find out who granted Cutter's parole...
And uh..

55:42.408 --> 55:43.917
Give me Keegan's rap sheet.

55:44.642 --> 55:45.691
Please.

55:54.092 --> 55:55.292
Wow.

55:55.792 --> 55:57.292
What's the occasion?

55:57.333 --> 55:58.833
Here, sit down.

56:03.417 --> 56:04.767
Can't believe it.

56:07.833 --> 56:09.550
I figured out my third wish.

56:09.708 --> 56:13.217
- But you didn't get your second wish yet.
- It's alright. We can come back to it.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.079
Okay.

56:15.080 --> 56:16.517
Lay it on me.

56:17.434 --> 56:18.434
Well.

56:18.458 --> 56:20.000
I know you're planning something...

56:20.333 --> 56:22.500
Something to get the money
to pay that guy back.

56:22.583 --> 56:24.542
- Gramps tell you that?
- No.

56:26.375 --> 56:28.125
Look, Will.
You know...

56:28.208 --> 56:30.300
Dad.
I want to help you.

56:32.458 --> 56:33.929
Getting you laid.

56:33.954 --> 56:37.116
And having you meet your mother
is one thing.

56:37.375 --> 56:39.036
- But this is ain't your problem.
- Dad...

56:39.667 --> 56:41.208
You have this problem because of me.

56:41.292 --> 56:42.592
That is not true.

56:43.333 --> 56:46.067
I was in the whole way
before you came along.

56:46.750 --> 56:47.950
Dad, I...

56:49.792 --> 56:52.833
I never done anything
that's so exciting as I did yesterday.

56:52.917 --> 56:54.042
And you and gramps...

56:54.583 --> 56:56.333
You guys have really lived it.

56:56.800 --> 56:58.400
I want to experience that,
you know?

56:58.442 --> 57:00.900
Oh no.
No, no, no...

57:02.042 --> 57:03.442
Trust me.

57:08.625 --> 57:10.025
I don't ...
I..

57:11.100 --> 57:14.083
I knew you weren't going to follow through
the fucking wishes.

57:14.092 --> 57:17.100
All you are..
is a liar and a fake.

57:35.333 --> 57:36.633
Will?

57:39.667 --> 57:41.167
Will,
open up!

57:47.792 --> 57:48.892
Hey.

58:23.083 --> 58:24.383
Hi, pal.

58:32.292 --> 58:33.392
Hey.

58:35.500 --> 58:36.800
What happened?

58:37.458 --> 58:40.208
The doctor said that you had a seizure.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.608
I guess it's kind of normal for this thing.

58:45.417 --> 58:46.717
Hello, boy.

58:58.458 --> 58:59.758
Dad, please.

58:59.917 --> 59:01.592
Please, please, please.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.592
What is it you want, William?

59:07.792 --> 59:09.092
Please.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
So this is Claude Monet.
He is an Impressionist.

59:18.458 --> 59:21.792
The word came from the name of one of his paintings.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.083
Called the impression sunrise.

59:25.408 --> 59:28.625
He's not trying to be exact like a photograph.

59:28.708 --> 59:29.708
a picture

59:29.792 --> 59:30.917
He is trying to..

59:32.583 --> 59:34.342
He is trying to paint the feeling.

59:35.875 --> 59:37.400
Like Paul Gauguin?

59:38.500 --> 59:39.700
Yeah.

59:40.292 --> 59:41.592
Like Gauguin.

59:41.851 --> 59:42.851
Yeah.

59:42.875 --> 59:44.125
It's a sunny day.

59:45.667 --> 59:47.625
It's spring time.

59:48.750 --> 59:51.200
Camille is looking at Monet.

59:52.083 --> 59:53.292
And Jean...

59:53.417 --> 59:54.417
Wait.

59:55.583 --> 59:56.883
Who are they?

59:57.000 --> 59:59.217
Camille is Monet's wife.

59:59.417 --> 01:00:01.875
And Jean,
is his eight year old son.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.167
So, it's going to be hard to fake?

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:12.500
No, you don't fake this.

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:14.500
I mean..
You can't copy it.

01:00:14.501 --> 01:00:16.058
You have to..

01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:19.525
You have to get inside it.
You know.

01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:21.167
It's hard to explain.

01:00:23.792 --> 01:00:25.047
But if I could..

01:00:25.072 --> 01:00:26.357
If I could..

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:29.908
Feel what he was feeling...

01:00:30.417 --> 01:00:32.667
You know, maybe..
Maybe I could do it.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:38.467
It's beautiful.

01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:41.758
It is.

01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:44.208
You ever going to Tahiti
like Paul Gauguin?

01:00:44.458 --> 01:00:45.758
I don't know.

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:56.100
Okay,
you just keep grinding.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.000
See all these minerals are pure.

01:00:58.042 --> 01:01:01.000
Like back in the day 1875,
There was no pollution, you know.

01:01:01.667 --> 01:01:04.908
Then, you know.
Factories came along and cars...

01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:09.633
They put little.. like black specks in the minerals.
So..

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:13.783
And you can't use that.
That's why I can't use my paints.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.200
Let's see how you are doing there.

01:01:16.292 --> 01:01:17.292
Good.

01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:18.333
Now uh, okay.

01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:19.458
Some oil.

01:01:19.875 --> 01:01:20.875
Hold still.

01:01:22.268 --> 01:01:23.268
Okay.

01:01:23.292 --> 01:01:24.708
Now, use this...

01:01:25.601 --> 01:01:26.601
Stir it up.

01:01:26.625 --> 01:01:29.408
- You want me to do it?
- Yeah. Go ahead, do it.

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:32.583
- See that?
- Yeah.

01:01:33.542 --> 01:01:36.892
And watch it becomes paint
right in front of your eyes.

01:02:19.292 --> 01:02:20.292
Hey.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.583
You take your meds?

01:02:23.417 --> 01:02:24.817
- Yup.
- Good.

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:32.092
Hey, dad.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:35.692
What you did today...

01:02:37.417 --> 01:02:39.142
It's pretty crazy.

01:02:41.292 --> 01:02:42.492
Thanks.

01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:46.292
Yeah, you know.
I could dunk my whole life.

01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:48.008
Should have.

01:02:52.042 --> 01:02:53.442
Why don't you?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.600
Let's get through all this.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.517
Tomorrow we start fresh.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.300
Alright.

01:03:09.375 --> 01:03:11.300
- Night.
- Night.

01:03:20.726 --> 01:03:21.726
Yeah.

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:24.825
Cutter's granted parole was signed by judge Jacob Brooks.

01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:28.583
Same judge who acquitted Keegan
of the second felony charge back in 03.

01:03:28.667 --> 01:03:30.583
So Keegan puts Cutter in prison...

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.825
And four years later,
gets him out.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.125
Why?
Cos he feel bad?

01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:36.500
Tommy Keegan doesn't know how to feel bad.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Yeah, Ray.

01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:40.275
She's coming right at you.

01:03:41.167 --> 01:03:42.467
Catherine.

01:03:43.583 --> 01:03:44.883
You want to talk?

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:47.467
It's okay.

01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:50.167
We're alone.

01:03:50.458 --> 01:03:52.792
I mean it's okay for both of us.

01:03:52.917 --> 01:03:55.042
How did you made me at Keegan's?

01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:56.633
I don't know.

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:58.125
You know.
You were asking a lot of questions.

01:03:58.149 --> 01:03:59.249
So...

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:01.000
This is really about Tommy Keegan, right?

01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:02.083
Maybe.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.392
I can't tell you nothing about him..

01:04:04.792 --> 01:04:07.650
Not that I care about him,
because I don't.

01:04:08.625 --> 01:04:10.200
But,
I'm not a snitch.

01:04:10.208 --> 01:04:12.833
- Never have been, never will be.
- Tommy Keegan was.

01:04:13.125 --> 01:04:14.950
Put you away for five years, huh.

01:04:15.025 --> 01:04:16.950
Keegan is in a serious debt
to the arroyo cartel.

01:04:17.133 --> 01:04:18.550
Do you know what that means?

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:21.083
Have you seen this man before?

01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:21.792
No.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:04:23.208 --> 01:04:26.600
His name is RaÃºl Carlo and
he is a real patron of the arts.

01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:28.500
Painting again, Ray?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.500
I need time.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.925
I need privacy.

01:04:36.292 --> 01:04:37.692
Because of your son?

01:04:37.718 --> 01:04:38.518
Yeah.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:40.375
Look, whatever you think
you owe Keegan.

01:04:41.917 --> 01:04:44.967
It's just going to destroy the time
you have left with Will.

01:04:46.167 --> 01:04:48.350
Help me to help you.

01:05:09.667 --> 01:05:10.967
You okay?

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.783
I just had a dream and...

01:05:25.533 --> 01:05:27.233
I'm here.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:29.758
Come here.

01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:46.758
Dad,
I'm scare.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.300
I know.

01:06:14.292 --> 01:06:15.492
Hey, Ray.

01:06:17.333 --> 01:06:18.833
How're we doing?
Huh.

01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:21.653
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:06:21.792 --> 01:06:23.683
I told you I get you the painting.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:24.750
My goodness.

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:27.042
Is that little William?

01:06:27.792 --> 01:06:30.300
Hey, you know what?
You got a phone call young man.

01:06:30.317 --> 01:06:31.908
Who is Tricia?

01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:34.417
Okay, go upstairs.
Go, go, go.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.708
Come on bro, are you getting some?

01:06:37.167 --> 01:06:38.825
He turned into a good looking young man.

01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:39.875
But he's a..

01:06:40.226 --> 01:06:41.226
I don't know.

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:42.042
Looking a little peakin.

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:45.500
I told Finn I'll break his fucking neck,
if he came near my son.

01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:47.042
And that goes for the three of you.

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:48.779
And stab him to death with a
fucking paintbrush, right?

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:49.941
Why, why the hostility?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Hostility?

01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:52.917
- Don't fucking move.
- Jesus Christ!

01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:54.375
Okay, pop, it ain't that kind of night.

01:06:54.399 --> 01:06:55.191
Okay.

01:06:55.292 --> 01:06:57.850
- Joe, come on, we're partners.
- Not with me, you're not.

01:06:57.875 --> 01:06:58.875
And this is my house...

01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:00.542
And I didn't invite you.

01:07:00.575 --> 01:07:03.017
Tommy, Tommy.
Why don't you take Collin and Finn...

01:07:03.042 --> 01:07:04.417
Tell them to wait in the car...

01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:06.425
And we'll talk, okay?

01:07:07.542 --> 01:07:09.167
- Tomorrow is D day .
- Yeah, I know it.

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:10.000
You ready?

01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:11.195
- No, it's not ready.
- Is it done?

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.090
But it will be done.

01:07:12.292 --> 01:07:15.383
The museum closes at 9:45.
I'll get it to you by midnight.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:18.640
You can bagged that up.

01:07:18.665 --> 01:07:20.599
Because I need to have it
at Copley (plaza) by midnight.

01:07:20.625 --> 01:07:22.292
Give it to me by eleven.

01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:23.950
For the..
For the buyer?

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.375
In person.

01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:30.033
And the appraiser.
Fuck.

01:07:31.133 --> 01:07:31.896
The appraiser.

01:07:31.921 --> 01:07:34.108
You got the contact
number for that guy?

01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:37.167
How much is this going to cost me?

01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:38.575
How the fuck should I know.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.983
I have not done this in years.

01:07:42.333 --> 01:07:44.042
- Fucking Minnesota.
[J.Ownsby-Appraiser-Minneapolis Division]

01:07:44.292 --> 01:07:45.217
Jesus!

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:47.692
You're really in trouble with this guy,
aren't you?

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.700
Yeah.

01:07:58.083 --> 01:08:00.217
- Tomorrow night. 11pm
- Yeah.

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:22.957
You should be so proud of Ray.

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:25.417
I know they are saying that..

01:08:25.875 --> 01:08:28.042
He's a better dad than me.
I ain't saying anything.

01:08:28.125 --> 01:08:29.625
But..
but there it is.

01:08:30.125 --> 01:08:31.250
And your grandson...

01:08:32.082 --> 01:08:33.082
Well,

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:36.125
He's just as tough as you were.

01:08:37.625 --> 01:08:38.625
So...

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:41.582
When you meet him.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.375
Take good care of him, will you.

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.850
I love you,
that's a fact.

01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:00.207
Yes.

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:02.675
Yes, it's me.

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:05.008
Whose calling?

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:32.000
Okay. Three 15 minutes bakes.
Five minutes apart.

01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:33.825
And 375.

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.008
Think we are okay.
The restaurant opens in an hour.

01:10:41.333 --> 01:10:42.750
Are you ready for this, boy?

01:10:45.167 --> 01:10:46.417
I'm just studying.

01:10:46.667 --> 01:10:48.708
Yeah, good.
Good, good.

01:10:49.417 --> 01:10:50.857
Alright, you guys got any questions?

01:10:50.917 --> 01:10:52.083
No.
No..

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:54.950
Well,

01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:57.367
I want to smoke these uh.. now.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
By a way of...

01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:02.592
celebrating our coming success.

01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:05.442
It's a sort of toast.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.525
Life is short...

01:11:09.792 --> 01:11:11.300
And things go wrong.

01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:13.175
May we always have enough.

01:11:18.333 --> 01:11:19.633
He's here.

01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:21.383
Just got ping by ICE

01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:25.367
Start with the top 3 hotels.

01:11:25.392 --> 01:11:27.474
Let me know when you find out
where he is headed.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.500
I'm on Cutter.

01:11:28.583 --> 01:11:30.242
Get someone on Keegan.

01:11:54.609 --> 01:11:55.609
Yeah.

01:11:55.633 --> 01:11:58.433
Okay, so. Carlos and two captains
just checked into the Conway.

01:11:58.458 --> 01:11:59.458
Shit!

01:12:02.042 --> 01:12:03.333
Whoa.
Lady, watch out.

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:05.375
This is a neighborhood,
there is children here.

01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:07.167
Sir, I need you to move your car.
Right now.

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.042
Really, you going to pull a badge?
Like what, you going to arrest me?

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:11.217
- For pulling out of my driveway.
- Sir, move your car.

01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:52.050
Sir.
You can't have drinks in here.

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:53.083
Damn.
What's that?

01:12:53.167 --> 01:12:54.850
You can't.
You can't have drinks in here.

01:12:54.917 --> 01:12:55.917
Oh, I don't know.

01:12:57.083 --> 01:13:00.000
- Sir, give me that sir. Give me the soda please.
- I'm thirsty, boy.

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:01.517
- Give me that. Give me that.
- The corridors are so long and such a long walk.

01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:03.750
- No, give me that. Give me that.
- Alright, let's go.

01:13:04.108 --> 01:13:05.908
Let's go.
Come on.

01:13:05.932 --> 01:13:07.432
Let's go.

01:13:18.867 --> 01:13:20.467
Thank you. Thank you.

01:13:20.467 --> 01:13:22.450
I was leaving anyway.

01:13:28.858 --> 01:13:29.748
Aye.

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:31.041
Sir, it's 9:30.

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.883
We are closing in fifteen minutes.

01:13:33.458 --> 01:13:34.458
Alright.

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:36.992
You have to leave now.

01:14:04.901 --> 01:14:06.101
Can I help you?

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:06.976
Federal police.

01:14:07.001 --> 01:14:08.816
- We need to take a look around.
- Yeah.

01:14:09.817 --> 01:14:11.125
Anything unusually?

01:14:11.208 --> 01:14:12.208
No.

01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:15.842
Just some old man who spilled a soda
in the European wing.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.117
I got to call Will.

01:14:26.417 --> 01:14:27.908
- Hey.
- Will.

01:14:28.167 --> 01:14:29.667
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:31.575
We're moving.
You got three minutes.

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:32.967
Alright.

01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:39.750
Hey.
What's the score, guys?

01:15:00.292 --> 01:15:01.875
Let me take that.

01:15:20.792 --> 01:15:23.175
- In the European wing.
- Show us.

01:15:23.458 --> 01:15:24.458
Sure.

01:15:30.833 --> 01:15:31.833
Right here.

01:15:32.667 --> 01:15:34.417
We have already mopped it up.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.800
What did he look like?

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.000
Just an old man.

01:15:39.375 --> 01:15:40.875
A little demented.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.300
Sad..

01:16:28.892 --> 01:16:30.292
Let's do a ride around.

01:16:30.333 --> 01:16:32.167
Thanks, guys.
Let's go.

01:16:34.042 --> 01:16:35.242
Now.

01:16:38.476 --> 01:16:39.476
Still on.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.500
Fuck.

01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:46.700
What the fuck?

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.542
Shit.

01:17:22.766 --> 01:17:23.966
Shit.

01:17:44.842 --> 01:17:46.392
The door is stuck.

01:17:46.475 --> 01:17:47.908
Get the fucking flashlight.

01:17:48.292 --> 01:17:49.458
Hit it.
Hit it.

<i>CAlling all units in the vicinity

Hey!
Hey!

01:18:21.792 --> 01:18:22.992
Stop!

01:18:29.292 --> 01:18:30.592
Come on!

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:34.000
Go, go, go...!

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.500
Holy shit!

01:18:47.208 --> 01:18:49.417
The police are on the scene here
at the MFA...

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.125
After an apparent break in.

01:18:51.208 --> 01:18:53.833
A small group of suspects
were able to disable the alarm.

01:18:53.917 --> 01:18:55.692
However, nothing was taken.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.200

01:19:06.625 --> 01:19:07.925
So what now?

01:19:08.208 --> 01:19:09.208
Now?

01:19:10.333 --> 01:19:13.033
Now, Finn is going to take this
to the guy.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.458
Along with this.

01:19:15.583 --> 01:19:17.783
And I am off the hook.

01:19:17.842 --> 01:19:19.742
Okay.
What about me?

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:21.475
When I leave here.

01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:23.083
I don't see you anymore, right?

01:19:23.167 --> 01:19:24.367
Not exactly.

01:19:28.167 --> 01:19:29.467
Fuck you!

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.600
I know you, Ray.

01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:36.583
So.

01:19:38.333 --> 01:19:40.158
After my man.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:43.300
Gets out of town with that stupid fucking picture.

01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:45.150
I'm going to make a call,

01:19:45.225 --> 01:19:47.612
They are going to take
one look at whatever the fuck

01:19:47.637 --> 01:19:49.528
it was,
you put on that wall.

01:19:49.553 --> 01:19:52.024
And they are going
to put you away.

01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:53.125
Again.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.492
So now,
why don't you get up.

01:19:59.792 --> 01:20:01.800
And get out the fuck out of here.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.583
- Yeah.
- Hey.

01:20:11.642 --> 01:20:14.208
I got eyes on Finn Gerrity
walking into the Copley Plaza.

01:20:14.292 --> 01:20:15.292
Jesus.

01:20:15.875 --> 01:20:18.783
- You need backup?
- No. I got DEA in the lobby.

01:20:24.007 --> 01:20:25.507
Here you go.

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:48.425
<i>Senor Ownsby..</i>

01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:53.292
I'll call you back.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.300
Catherine.

01:20:58.542 --> 01:21:00.383
Let this play out.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.375
If you want to bust this guy Carlos.

01:21:03.042 --> 01:21:05.075
Just let it play out.

01:21:19.167 --> 01:21:22.217
Do you have the payment
for Mr.Owensby?

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:25.500
Yeah, I got the payment.

01:21:34.792 --> 01:21:36.442
One hundred thousand dollars.

01:21:37.417 --> 01:21:38.458
Yeah, it's all there.

01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:39.625
So...

01:21:40.292 --> 01:21:44.425
This guy comes all the way from
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

01:21:45.542 --> 01:21:48.592
To tell me that Tommy Keegan
is a fool.

01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:52.542
What the fuck does that suppose to mean?

01:21:52.625 --> 01:21:54.825
I always thought that Mr. Keegan
was stupid.

01:21:55.042 --> 01:21:57.075
But I didn't know he was
this stupid.

01:21:57.083 --> 01:21:58.925
Bullshit!
Wait a minute.

01:22:00.851 --> 01:22:01.851
Oh, what the fuck?

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:03.583
Let's go visit Tommy Keegan.

01:22:03.667 --> 01:22:04.667
Fuck that!

01:22:05.667 --> 01:22:07.200
Mr.Owensby?

01:22:15.833 --> 01:22:18.042
- Mr...uh.. Carlos.
- Carlos.

01:22:19.767 --> 01:22:21.567
I'm.. sorry.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.950
Not only is this a forgery.

01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:29.150
It's a bad one at that.

01:22:31.242 --> 01:22:33.275
So it's worth nothing?

01:22:39.083 --> 01:22:40.083
It's for you.

01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:55.375
- Here they are.
- Oh shirt!

01:22:55.458 --> 01:22:56.542
No.
Don't, don't, don't...

01:22:56.625 --> 01:22:58.050
He's coming back.

01:22:58.125 --> 01:23:00.016
Okay, he's going to
pay someone a visit.

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:01.032
He'll be back.

01:23:01.083 --> 01:23:02.917
You don't have anything on him anyway.

01:23:05.208 --> 01:23:06.508
Can't wait.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Pop!

01:23:26.158 --> 01:23:27.458
Geronimo.

01:23:28.083 --> 01:23:29.083
What did you do?

01:23:29.133 --> 01:23:30.783
Okay.
There's a painting upstairs.

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:32.767
It's a Monet.
It's the real thing.

01:23:32.917 --> 01:23:33.750
When they come back.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.141
You arrest them.
Read them their rights..

01:23:35.166 --> 01:23:36.698
- ..whatever you guys do.
- That's right.

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:38.310
Wait a minute.
Nothing was taken.

01:23:38.333 --> 01:23:39.533
Trust me.

01:23:39.542 --> 01:23:41.208
You just be very careful
with the painting.

01:23:41.292 --> 01:23:42.658
Bring it back to the museum

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:44.242
They'll know exactly what to do.

01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:45.333
Yeah.

01:23:46.667 --> 01:23:48.361
I thought you didn't snitch.

01:23:48.386 --> 01:23:49.232
I don't.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.758
It's just this guy Carlos
ain't from here.

01:23:53.167 --> 01:23:54.708
We have to go.
Okay.

01:24:12.708 --> 01:24:14.000
Jesus!

01:24:17.208 --> 01:24:19.308
Any sign of Finn Gerrity and Collin Corley?

01:24:19.458 --> 01:24:20.800
No, not a trace.

01:24:22.375 --> 01:24:25.125
It's been over an hour.
Why is he taking so long?

01:24:25.917 --> 01:24:28.217
When I was his age,
two minutes tops.

01:24:28.542 --> 01:24:30.292
This is fucking ridiculous.

01:24:36.792 --> 01:24:38.192
Goodbye, Tricia.

01:24:51.583 --> 01:24:52.883
Hey, pop.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.125
Thanks for taking care of him
while I was away.

01:24:55.208 --> 01:24:56.750
- Oh, stop it.
- Yeah, you know.

01:24:59.292 --> 01:25:00.333
- Well?
- Hey!

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
How did it go?

01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.740
Gramps.

01:25:04.965 --> 01:25:06.332
That's none of your business.

01:25:06.417 --> 01:25:07.917
Alright, sergeant.

01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:35.267
- Carl.
- Goodbye.

01:25:39.333 --> 01:25:41.333
Bet he wishes he was going.

01:25:41.917 --> 01:25:43.450
Okay, here we are.

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.500
Dad.

01:25:47.008 --> 01:25:48.114
You sure, huh ?

01:25:48.139 --> 01:25:50.099
Yeah, this is the real thing.

01:25:51.083 --> 01:25:52.383
Here we go!

01:25:53.167 --> 01:25:54.467
Thank you.

01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:05.800
- Have a nice flight.
- Yeah, thanks.

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:07.550
Thanks.

01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:30.367
I have never seen him this happy.

01:26:42.042 --> 01:26:43.542
Hey, dad.

01:26:45.167 --> 01:26:47.250
If you had one wish.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
What would you wish for?

01:27:04.083 --> 01:27:06.708
Come on in.
You two pantsies.

01:27:09.208 --> 01:27:11.467
Join me. The water is fine.
For Christ sake.

01:27:12.458 --> 01:27:13.858
Hey, Will.

01:27:14.875 --> 01:27:17.792
What do you say we explore Polynesia, huh.

01:27:18.083 --> 01:27:20.250
We go to..
We go to Fiji,

01:27:21.083 --> 01:27:22.458
We go to Tonga.

01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:26.317
We go to Marquesas.
That's where Gauguin lived.

01:27:29.875 --> 01:27:31.075
We got time.

01:27:31.667 --> 01:27:32.867
What do you think?

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:35.889
Jump in and join me.
