WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:03.068
Previously on The.

00:03.336 --> 00:04.870
Amazing Race, for the first

00:05.005 --> 00:06.238
time ever, 22 strangers formed

00:06.373 --> 00:08.140
11 teams at the starting line.

00:08.274 --> 00:09.441
I pick Sara.

00:09.576 --> 00:10.376
Woo hoo.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.343
I'm Matt.

00:11.478 --> 00:12.911
You cool with being on my team?

00:13.046 --> 00:14.279
Absolutely.

00:14.414 --> 00:15.547
In Sao Paulo, Liz

00:15.682 --> 00:16.382
cleaned up.

00:16.516 --> 00:17.282
Woo!

00:17.417 --> 00:19.118
Liz, you are a rock star!

00:19.252 --> 00:20.085
Giving her and

00:20.220 --> 00:21.353
Michael the comeback win.

00:21.488 --> 00:22.588
You are team number 1!

00:25.291 --> 00:26.392
Shamir lost his cool.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.526
He did break it.

00:27.594 --> 00:28.327
I need a doctor.

00:28.461 --> 00:29.161
I need an ambulance.

00:29.295 --> 00:30.029
But Jessica and

00:30.163 --> 00:30.863
Francesca lost the leg.

00:30.997 --> 00:31.697
You have been eliminated

00:31.831 --> 00:32.531
from the race.

00:32.665 --> 00:33.499
Nine teams remain,

00:33.633 --> 00:35.434
who will be eliminated next?

00:35.568 --> 00:36.368
What a day.

00:36.503 --> 00:37.503
Smokin'!

01:26.019 --> 01:27.139
I said from the beginning

01:27.187 --> 01:28.520
that no matter who my partner is

01:28.655 --> 01:29.888
I'm going to make the best out

01:30.023 --> 01:31.890
of this.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.125
And I think that I'm being

01:33.259 --> 01:34.426
tested for sure.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.563
Yo, dude.

01:37.697 --> 01:40.632
We were welcomed by this huge

01:40.767 --> 01:41.567
group of incredible individuals

01:41.701 --> 01:43.168
and then he goes in the corner

01:43.303 --> 01:44.380
and starts talking about his

01:44.404 --> 01:45.137
junk again.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.472
Every subsequent thing that

01:46.606 --> 01:48.107
I went down hurt more and it all

01:48.241 --> 01:48.974
was the harness.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.576
I went back up after... you know

01:50.710 --> 01:52.444
I got some ice and he fixed my

01:52.579 --> 01:53.819
harness, I went down three more

01:53.947 --> 01:54.646
times no problem.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.281
How do you feel now though?

01:56.416 --> 01:57.426
Like seriously, are you okay?

01:57.450 --> 01:58.584
I have to keep going.

01:58.718 --> 01:59.852
I don't like drama and

01:59.986 --> 02:01.186
there's already a lot of drama

02:01.221 --> 02:02.354
going on in some of these

02:02.489 --> 02:03.188
other teams.

02:03.323 --> 02:04.490
We are definitely not

02:04.624 --> 02:05.668
getting on each other's nerves

02:05.692 --> 02:07.092
and not getting caught up in any

02:07.227 --> 02:07.926
of the BS.

02:08.061 --> 02:08.759
Good job, guys.

02:08.895 --> 02:09.595
Strong work.

02:09.729 --> 02:10.429
Good job.

02:10.562 --> 02:11.263
Thank you.

02:11.397 --> 02:12.064
Woo.

02:12.198 --> 02:12.931
Woo. Yay.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.333
We are getting along

02:14.467 --> 02:15.167
tremendously.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.568
We really haven't had any

02:16.703 --> 02:17.369
arguments.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.071
I'm very happy with my partner.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.772
I think I made the right

02:20.907 --> 02:21.640
decision.

02:21.774 --> 02:22.441
That's wild.

02:22.575 --> 02:23.408
We definitely are

02:23.543 --> 02:24.243
learning each other's

02:24.377 --> 02:25.077
personalities.

02:25.211 --> 02:26.291
It's not like we've been

02:26.412 --> 02:27.246
friends for years. You know

02:27.380 --> 02:28.447
you don't know the ins and

02:28.581 --> 02:29.882
outs of how to deal with someone

02:30.016 --> 02:30.883
and this is super high-stress

02:31.017 --> 02:31.717
situation.

02:31.851 --> 02:33.152
We have to work together to

02:33.286 --> 02:33.986
win a million dollars.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.160
Everybody, deep inhale,

02:35.188 --> 02:36.255
and exhale.

02:40.426 --> 02:41.527
Fly to the city.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.496
Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania.

02:44.631 --> 02:47.166
Liz and Michael will be the

02:47.300 --> 02:49.535
first to fly more than 6,000

02:49.669 --> 02:51.069
miles to the east coast of

02:51.204 --> 02:52.404
Africa and the nation of

02:52.539 --> 02:54.606
Tanzania.

02:54.741 --> 02:55.818
Once there they must head to.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.209
Askari Monument, a statue

02:57.343 --> 02:58.677
commemorating the African

02:58.811 --> 03:00.112
soldiers that fought in.

03:00.246 --> 03:01.246
World War I.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.348
Teams will find their next clue

03:03.483 --> 03:04.483
nearby buried somewhere

03:04.551 --> 03:05.551
in the news.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.286
You have $320.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.700
Just beware of the race caution:

03:08.821 --> 03:09.861
Blind double U turn ahead.

03:09.989 --> 03:11.256
Well, right on, right on,

03:11.391 --> 03:12.224
let's go. Let's boogie.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.126
Fly to the city of Dar Es.

03:14.260 --> 03:14.960
Salaam in Tanzania.

03:15.094 --> 03:15.861
Blind double U-turn

03:15.995 --> 03:16.695
ahead.

03:16.829 --> 03:17.529
God.

03:17.664 --> 03:18.363
Okay, let's go.

03:18.498 --> 03:19.231
Let's go.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.365
Let's go, let's go,

03:20.433 --> 03:21.133
let's go.

03:21.267 --> 03:21.967
We're having a blast.

03:22.101 --> 03:23.179
Yeah, there's no drama with

03:23.203 --> 03:23.902
this team because we're

03:24.037 --> 03:24.703
team man.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.271
We like a lot of the teams

03:26.406 --> 03:27.773
but also a lot of these teams we

03:27.907 --> 03:29.018
like are, you know, are strong

03:29.042 --> 03:29.708
competition.

03:29.842 --> 03:30.882
So it's a blind U-turn.

03:30.910 --> 03:31.610
We're U-turning somebody, dude.

03:31.744 --> 03:32.444
Maybe Seth and Olive.

03:32.579 --> 03:33.278
It's a race.

03:33.413 --> 03:34.653
You know we're not here to make

03:34.714 --> 03:35.480
friends.

03:35.615 --> 03:36.815
We're probably going to.

03:36.950 --> 03:37.649
U-turned.

03:37.784 --> 03:38.984
Absolutely, I mean we're

03:39.118 --> 03:39.818
a strong team.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.753
Other teams want to try to get

03:41.888 --> 03:43.689
ahead of us so I definitely see

03:43.823 --> 03:44.823
that as a possibility.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.658
My initial thought would be.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.961
U-turn Matt and Redmond as

03:49.095 --> 03:49.861
payback and they won't even

03:49.996 --> 03:51.163
know it.

03:51.297 --> 03:52.731
We've got to get Ashton and.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.099
Vanck on our side in case

03:54.234 --> 03:55.234
they're in front of us.

03:55.368 --> 03:56.568
It's the only team I'm worried

03:56.703 --> 03:57.502
about maybe U-turning us.

03:57.637 --> 03:58.877
We had a handshake agreement

03:58.938 --> 04:00.018
leaving Panama that we were

04:00.073 --> 04:01.573
going to toss a coin once we

04:01.708 --> 04:03.108
both got to the heli park to

04:03.243 --> 04:04.509
determine who was going to be

04:04.644 --> 04:06.044
first and who was going to be

04:06.179 --> 04:06.878
second.

04:07.013 --> 04:08.057
And they just totally ditched

04:08.081 --> 04:08.780
on that.

04:08.915 --> 04:09.915
They're not here, so.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.216
I don't know what happened.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.918
I'm sorry, we love you team,

04:13.052 --> 04:14.052
but...

04:14.721 --> 04:15.988
We may have been jerks a

04:16.122 --> 04:16.822
little bit.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.523
I just don't like it when

04:18.658 --> 04:19.858
people screw me over.

04:21.961 --> 04:23.662
Fly to the city of...

04:23.796 --> 04:26.465
Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania, dude.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.699
Let's go, Becca, let's go.

04:27.834 --> 04:28.533
Let's do it.

04:28.668 --> 04:29.468
We going to Tanzania.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.335
We're going to!

04:30.470 --> 04:31.303
Is Tanzania quiche?

04:31.437 --> 04:33.305
My God, I still don't know

04:33.439 --> 04:34.106
what it means.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.307
I'm not participating.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.042
Quiche means you're hotter

04:37.176 --> 04:39.511
than hot yet still cool.

04:39.646 --> 04:40.979
I'm too old for this.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.447
No you're not.

04:43.983 --> 04:44.983
She is.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.386
I'm just kidding.

04:48.588 --> 04:49.454
Yeah, I think we're team

04:49.589 --> 04:50.666
fun and we're team adorable, so

04:50.690 --> 04:52.124
I think, I think, I'm personally

04:52.258 --> 04:53.392
not that worried about the

04:53.526 --> 04:54.226
blind U-turn.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.794
I think our communication is

04:55.928 --> 04:57.396
amazing and every time we talk

04:57.530 --> 04:58.964
about our skills we just find

04:59.098 --> 05:00.565
out more how we complement each

05:00.700 --> 05:01.433
other.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.302
Exactly.

05:03.436 --> 05:04.970
It's actually absurd.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.406
If we need to use the U-turn

05:07.540 --> 05:08.617
we're going to use the U-turn.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.641
I'm not here to make best

05:09.776 --> 05:10.475
friends.

05:10.610 --> 05:11.643
I'm here to win a million

05:11.778 --> 05:12.477
dollars for my family.

05:12.612 --> 05:13.652
Up until this point nobody

05:13.780 --> 05:15.080
really knew much about us,

05:15.214 --> 05:15.914
you know.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.192
Yeah, we've been kind of...

05:17.216 --> 05:18.050
He's a Boston cop.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.304
He's got a lot of experience

05:19.352 --> 05:20.592
under his belt and I think they

05:20.720 --> 05:23.255
just thought I was a mom.

05:26.092 --> 05:26.792
That hurt.

05:26.926 --> 05:27.626
Are you okay?

05:27.760 --> 05:28.760
That's a great way to

05:28.861 --> 05:29.861
start the day.

05:30.530 --> 05:31.229
Airport hub.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.604
The last leg I was injured a

05:32.699 --> 05:34.199
bit and just really frustrated

05:34.334 --> 05:36.201
with how the day went, but I'm

05:36.336 --> 05:38.170
just ready to tackle on this leg

05:38.304 --> 05:39.348
and just really get back to

05:39.372 --> 05:40.372
the top.

05:43.009 --> 05:43.742
Back to Africa.

05:43.876 --> 05:44.876
Africa.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.184
So everyone's on this flight

05:46.279 --> 05:47.519
and we're all headed to Africa.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.147
It's a big even field right

05:49.282 --> 05:49.981
now.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.883
It's going to be a mad dash from

05:52.018 --> 05:53.218
the airport once we get there.

06:05.465 --> 06:06.164
Taxi.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.165
Taxi, taxi stand.

06:07.300 --> 06:07.966
Go, go.

06:08.101 --> 06:08.867
Taxi stand, boom!

06:09.001 --> 06:10.001
Go, go, go, go, go!

06:10.069 --> 06:10.802
The Askari Monument.

06:10.937 --> 06:11.603
Okay.

06:11.738 --> 06:12.471
Do you know?

06:12.605 --> 06:13.271
Yes, I know.

06:13.406 --> 06:14.106
Excellent. Let's go.

06:14.240 --> 06:14.940
Change.

06:15.074 --> 06:15.941
Okay, let's go, let's go,

06:16.075 --> 06:16.775
let's go.

06:16.909 --> 06:17.776
Watch your head, watch your

06:17.910 --> 06:18.910
head, watch your head!

06:19.579 --> 06:20.445
Dude, this is so sick.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.613
We're in Tanzania.

06:21.748 --> 06:22.781
We are in Tanzania

06:22.915 --> 06:23.915
right now.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.854
There's Redmond and Matt.

06:28.988 --> 06:30.655
No way, not today.

06:30.790 --> 06:31.523
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:31.657 --> 06:32.424
Not today, pretty

06:32.558 --> 06:33.258
boy.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.633
We're going to get up there.

06:34.694 --> 06:35.961
You guys just hold on a second.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.095
Sir, would you let us-

06:37.830 --> 06:38.530
It's pretty awesome.

06:38.664 --> 06:39.798
I never in a million years

06:39.932 --> 06:41.333
thought I would be here.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.334
This is like, bucket list type

06:42.468 --> 06:43.201
stuff right now.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.436
My gosh, I know.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.904
Hopefully we won't have to do

06:46.038 --> 06:46.705
any driving around here.

06:46.839 --> 06:47.850
That would be a nightmare.

06:47.874 --> 06:48.573
I know, right.

06:48.708 --> 06:49.718
My handy-dandy compass is

06:49.742 --> 06:50.753
working properly and we are

06:50.777 --> 06:51.777
headed in the exact right

06:51.811 --> 06:52.811
direction.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.847
We're looking for

06:55.982 --> 06:56.681
a newspaper stand.

06:56.816 --> 06:58.350
I see it right there.

06:58.484 --> 06:59.785
We'll get out right here.

06:59.919 --> 07:00.619
Okay, okay, okay.

07:00.753 --> 07:01.453
Yup, yup.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.854
Okay, it's this way.

07:02.989 --> 07:03.722
It's this way. Okay.

07:03.856 --> 07:04.556
Go, go, go.

07:04.690 --> 07:05.690
What do we got?

07:05.825 --> 07:07.025
What are we looking for?

07:07.160 --> 07:07.926
I don't know.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.728
Open it and look for a clue.

07:10.763 --> 07:11.496
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:11.631 --> 07:12.330
Alright.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.465
Right here, got it.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.710
"Travel to Zanzibar for your

07:14.734 --> 07:15.434
next clue."

07:15.568 --> 07:16.935
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

07:17.069 --> 07:17.836
Travel to Zanzibar.

07:17.970 --> 07:18.981
Right here, right here.

07:19.005 --> 07:19.738
Let's go.

07:19.872 --> 07:20.883
No, Becca, Becca, guys,

07:20.907 --> 07:21.606
guys.

07:21.741 --> 07:22.441
, it's this way.

07:22.575 --> 07:23.775
We're going to the ferry

07:23.910 --> 07:24.987
terminal. Let's go this way.

07:25.011 --> 07:25.744
Are you sure?

07:25.878 --> 07:27.012
Yes.

07:27.146 --> 07:28.380
Sorry, guys, excuse me.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.248
Sorry, sorry, thank you.

07:30.383 --> 07:31.683
We're right behind you, okay?

07:31.818 --> 07:34.486
Hi, two to, Zanzibar.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.821
Wait, how are they skipping

07:35.955 --> 07:36.988
the line?

07:37.123 --> 07:38.924
Hey guys, there's a line here.

07:39.058 --> 07:39.758
Are you kidding?

07:39.892 --> 07:40.592
They just cut everybody

07:40.726 --> 07:41.426
in line.

07:41.561 --> 07:42.427
It's all going to be

07:42.562 --> 07:43.261
the 7 o'clock ferry.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.095
If not we'll throw them

07:44.230 --> 07:45.230
overboard.

07:45.898 --> 07:46.598
Yeah, fastest.

07:46.732 --> 07:47.432
Early.

07:47.567 --> 07:48.687
We're sure were all going

07:48.734 --> 07:49.734
to be on 7?

07:50.403 --> 07:51.069
Okay, well whatever.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.737
I mean now it's just... now it is

07:52.872 --> 07:53.605
a matter of principle.

07:53.739 --> 07:54.850
This is mark number two against

07:54.874 --> 07:55.607
them.

07:55.741 --> 07:56.852
Because they screwed you with

07:56.876 --> 07:57.576
the helicopter?

07:57.710 --> 07:59.010
They so... it didn't end up

07:59.145 --> 07:59.845
mattering, but again, it's

07:59.979 --> 08:00.679
principle.

08:00.813 --> 08:01.613
There's some bickering going

08:01.747 --> 08:02.447
on in line.

08:02.582 --> 08:03.849
We just kept our mouth shut.

08:03.983 --> 08:04.683
Thank you.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.585
This is the wrong time to get in

08:06.719 --> 08:07.752
an argument with a team.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.221
We got that U-turn coming up.

08:09.355 --> 08:10.755
We don't want a U-turn, so.

08:10.890 --> 08:11.590
Blind double.

08:11.724 --> 08:13.391
We're going to play it safe,

08:13.526 --> 08:14.646
sneak on through that thing.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.747
We're going to Zanzibar.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.502
Zanzibar.

08:23.636 --> 08:24.402
It's beautiful.

08:24.537 --> 08:25.203
Look at that.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.172
If I would've woke up 20 days

08:27.306 --> 08:29.207
ago and you told me I'd be in

08:29.342 --> 08:30.609
Africa today I'd call you a

08:30.743 --> 08:31.743
liar.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.312
Bye, Dar El Salaam.

08:34.447 --> 08:35.881
Look at the beach.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.015
Holy cow, look at

08:37.149 --> 08:37.849
the people.

08:37.984 --> 08:38.984
Wow, wow!

08:39.085 --> 08:40.085
This is surreal.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.953
We're all friends

08:42.087 --> 08:43.087
right now and...

08:43.188 --> 08:45.790
Once we get off the

08:45.925 --> 08:46.625
boat...

08:46.759 --> 08:47.759
It's game time.

08:50.329 --> 08:51.196
Woo!

08:51.330 --> 08:52.531
Go, go, go, go!

08:52.665 --> 08:54.099
Go, go, go, go, go!

08:54.233 --> 08:54.933
Joey.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.067
Excuse me, excuse me.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.235
Let's find a taxi.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.103
Let's find a taxi.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.538
The Mkokotoni Market and

08:59.672 --> 09:00.972
there is a U-turn directly ahead

09:01.107 --> 09:02.407
so we've got to get there fast.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.075
Teams are about to face a

09:04.210 --> 09:05.477
blind U-turn, the first

09:05.611 --> 09:07.012
opportunity that teams have to

09:07.146 --> 09:08.914
slow down another team, forcing

09:09.048 --> 09:10.649
them to perform both sides of

09:10.783 --> 09:11.483
the detour.

09:11.617 --> 09:12.784
Yeah, one of the.

09:12.919 --> 09:13.919
U turns this season so,

09:13.986 --> 09:15.420
son of a bitch, let's use it.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.755
You know what I mean?

09:16.889 --> 09:17.889
Let's be the bad guys.

09:17.990 --> 09:18.990
You can pass anyone.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.559
We don't care how fast you go.

09:20.693 --> 09:21.860
Are we going to U-turn

09:21.994 --> 09:22.694
somebody?

09:22.828 --> 09:24.229
The fire fighter and the cop,

09:24.363 --> 09:25.374
Seth, and Olive, they're so

09:25.398 --> 09:26.097
strong.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.599
This is where we make our move.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.733
If we're there first.

09:28.768 --> 09:29.768
Pass this taxi, yeah,

09:29.835 --> 09:30.835
pass this taxi.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.704
No!

09:34.073 --> 09:35.774
Hi. See ya!

09:35.908 --> 09:37.576
Vanck and Ashton, that's

09:37.710 --> 09:38.843
seriously the only team I'm,

09:38.978 --> 09:41.646
worried about.

09:44.183 --> 09:44.916
Joey!

09:45.051 --> 09:45.750
Here's the board,

09:45.885 --> 09:46.585
here's the board.

09:46.719 --> 09:47.419
Yeah.

09:47.553 --> 09:48.253
Vanck, come on.

09:48.387 --> 09:49.087
Come on, Mike.

09:49.221 --> 09:50.288
We're team number two.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.523
Do you see them?

09:51.657 --> 09:52.357
Yeah.

09:52.491 --> 09:53.825
We choose to U-turn Seth and.

09:53.960 --> 09:54.659
Olive.

09:54.794 --> 09:55.914
We knew from the get go that

09:55.995 --> 09:56.695
they were probably the

09:56.829 --> 09:57.529
strongest.

09:57.663 --> 09:58.840
They're in a league of their

09:58.864 --> 10:00.042
own and we wanted to, you know,

10:00.066 --> 10:01.266
give them a taste of what it's

10:01.300 --> 10:02.460
like to be, you know, back in

10:02.501 --> 10:03.168
the pack.

10:03.302 --> 10:04.382
We choose to U-turn Matt

10:04.503 --> 10:05.503
and Redmond.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.707
Detour, build it or weave it.

10:08.841 --> 10:09.985
It doesn't matter where you

10:10.009 --> 10:11.710
go in the world, education is a

10:11.844 --> 10:14.379
priority...

10:17.550 --> 10:18.617
And here in Tanzania

10:18.751 --> 10:20.251
school supplies and desks like

10:20.386 --> 10:22.754
this are in short supply.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.656
Teams can now help provide a

10:24.790 --> 10:26.024
valuable seat for the students

10:26.158 --> 10:27.258
by piecing together these

10:27.393 --> 10:29.227
donated supplies.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.662
When the carpenter approves of

10:30.796 --> 10:31.596
their handiwork they must

10:31.731 --> 10:33.198
deliver the desks to a classroom

10:33.332 --> 10:36.134
for a quick Swahili lesson.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.802
There are more than a million

10:37.937 --> 10:39.537
plastic bags use around the

10:39.672 --> 10:41.373
world every minute.

10:41.507 --> 10:43.274
These toxic bags are now banned

10:43.409 --> 10:44.909
on the island of Zanzibar.

10:45.044 --> 10:46.511
Locals have replaced them with

10:46.646 --> 10:48.113
a green sustainable solution

10:48.247 --> 10:51.449
made with coconut leaves.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.151
Each team must weave two baskets

10:53.285 --> 10:55.086
to get their next clue.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.521
To reach both detours, teams

10:56.656 --> 10:57.989
will travel across the bay in a

10:58.124 --> 10:58.823
traditional sailing vessel

10:58.958 --> 10:59.658
called a dhow.

10:59.792 --> 11:00.492
We're building it.

11:00.626 --> 11:01.760
We're going to build it,

11:01.894 --> 11:02.594
definitely.

11:02.728 --> 11:03.728
We're going to do

11:03.763 --> 11:04.462
building.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.296
Can't use weaving.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.097
Build it?

11:06.232 --> 11:06.965
Yeah.

11:07.099 --> 11:08.466
We're going to do build it.

11:08.601 --> 11:09.267
My gosh.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.135
Good God.

11:10.269 --> 11:10.935
We are not u-turn!

11:11.070 --> 11:12.203
We are not u-turn.

11:14.006 --> 11:14.739
We're u-turn.

11:14.874 --> 11:15.540
It's definitely

11:15.675 --> 11:16.408
Ashton and Vanck.

11:16.542 --> 11:17.622
We're going to build it.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.943
We're going to do build it.

11:19.078 --> 11:20.345
We're going to do build it.

11:20.479 --> 11:21.179
That's okay.

11:21.313 --> 11:22.180
We can deal with this.

11:22.314 --> 11:23.014
Let's weave it.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.015
We're going to weave it.

11:24.150 --> 11:24.849
Yes.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.518
I can weave it like no other.

11:26.652 --> 11:27.829
On the dock, straight ahead.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.187
Do you see it?

11:29.321 --> 11:30.321
There's a flag.

11:30.456 --> 11:31.489
Let's go, Joe.

11:31.624 --> 11:32.957
Hey, Vanck and Ashton,

11:33.092 --> 11:33.825
where are you?

11:33.959 --> 11:35.060
We'll get you!

11:37.029 --> 11:37.862
Okay, we've been u-turned.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.107
So, let's get the next clue.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.432
We have to do both detours.

11:40.566 --> 11:41.232
They've been u-turned.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.100
They u-turned?

11:42.234 --> 11:43.394
Obviously one of the teams

11:43.436 --> 11:44.102
that got here first

11:44.236 --> 11:44.969
u-turned us.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.304
We've just got to deal with

11:46.439 --> 11:47.172
that and move on.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.606
We're going to get you guys,

11:48.741 --> 11:49.741
you know that, right?

11:50.743 --> 11:52.110
Yeah, but we are going to

11:52.244 --> 11:53.545
get you, look at me, Vanck, I

11:53.679 --> 11:55.947
hope you're scared,

11:56.082 --> 11:57.115
are you scared?

11:57.249 --> 11:58.583
Because you should be scared.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.019
Redmond, stop.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.273
You only u-turn if you're

12:02.354 --> 12:03.474
weak, so, you guys are weak.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.789
It's over here, Joey.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.424
Grab this one, the first one,

12:06.559 --> 12:07.959
it's marked and no one's on it.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.596
I'm in, okay, we're ready.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.731
I'm stuck.

12:14.633 --> 12:15.767
My god...

12:15.901 --> 12:17.061
Do you want to hold hands?

12:17.103 --> 12:18.336
Sure.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.738
I can't believe they

12:19.872 --> 12:20.572
u-turned.

12:20.706 --> 12:21.406
That's messed up.

12:21.540 --> 12:22.407
That is messed up.

12:22.541 --> 12:23.241
There's Seth and Olive.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.242
Better them than us.

12:24.376 --> 12:25.387
Did you hear Redmond going

12:25.411 --> 12:26.478
off on Ashton?

12:26.612 --> 12:27.912
Dude, those guys are pissed.

12:28.047 --> 12:29.581
The claws are going to be out.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.954
Vanck and Ashton u-turned

12:36.088 --> 12:36.955
us.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.333
They're just so afraid of us,

12:38.357 --> 12:39.190
because we're so much stronger

12:39.325 --> 12:40.024
than they are.

12:40.159 --> 12:40.859
And they're really just

12:40.993 --> 12:41.659
a weak pathetic team.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.094
He's trying to be hateful and

12:43.229 --> 12:44.372
he's trying to be aggressive and

12:44.396 --> 12:45.676
he's trying to get inside of our

12:45.798 --> 12:46.464
head right now.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.776
That's what he's trying to do.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.067
We're going to be neck and

12:49.201 --> 12:50.502
neck with Redmond and Matt.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.504
It is what it is now.

12:52.638 --> 12:53.638
Yup.

12:53.706 --> 12:54.750
Seth and Olive got u-turned

12:54.774 --> 12:56.141
so they're a tough team, so you

12:56.275 --> 12:57.876
know what we are going to have a

12:58.010 --> 12:59.054
good competition on our hands.

12:59.078 --> 12:59.778
Hey, Joey.

12:59.912 --> 13:01.152
You guys u-turn Seth and Olive?

13:01.213 --> 13:02.247
No we didn't.

13:02.381 --> 13:03.615
You're lying.

13:03.749 --> 13:04.749
You had to have.

13:04.850 --> 13:05.850
Not even.

13:05.885 --> 13:06.751
Who did?

13:06.886 --> 13:07.986
I don't know.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.320
Boldfaced liars.

13:11.190 --> 13:11.890
Right here.

13:12.024 --> 13:12.791
Okay, there we go.

13:12.925 --> 13:13.925
Get out.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.260
You with me, Floyd?

13:15.394 --> 13:16.261
I'm here.

13:16.395 --> 13:17.395
Wet feet, okay.

13:17.496 --> 13:18.163
Come on.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.330
What are we doing?

13:19.465 --> 13:20.131
Keep going.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.065
To the right.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.967
Red, what do you want to do

13:23.102 --> 13:23.768
first?

13:23.903 --> 13:25.403
We've got to do both of them.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.237
Go weaving.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.071
Weaving. Alright.

13:27.206 --> 13:27.906
We don't want Matt

13:28.040 --> 13:28.740
and Redmond to see us.

13:28.874 --> 13:29.574
If we go fast, it's

13:29.708 --> 13:30.719
going to light a fire under

13:30.743 --> 13:31.442
them to go faster.

13:31.577 --> 13:33.478
We are only racing Matt and.

13:33.612 --> 13:34.479
Redmond right now.

13:34.613 --> 13:35.780
Build it.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.356
Tara, Tara, right here,

13:38.417 --> 13:39.751
come over here.

13:39.885 --> 13:40.652
This one, right here.

13:40.786 --> 13:41.486
Joey.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.320
Hey, Scott!

13:42.454 --> 13:43.154
Yeah?

13:43.289 --> 13:44.022
Let's take that one.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.190
Is there an example

13:45.324 --> 13:46.090
somewhere to go on?

13:46.225 --> 13:47.305
No, there's no examples.

13:47.426 --> 13:48.426
We have to build two.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.294
What are we build...

13:49.428 --> 13:50.128
We're building desks?

13:50.262 --> 13:52.230
Just turn 'em all out and

13:52.364 --> 13:53.698
look at what we've got.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.166
So, there's a hole here,

13:55.301 --> 13:56.601
so, we go like this?

13:56.735 --> 13:57.802
Okay, you hold it.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.007
I'm good at building but I've

14:03.142 --> 14:03.842
never seen anything like this.

14:03.976 --> 14:04.676
Look, watch me.

14:04.810 --> 14:05.510
Okay.

14:05.644 --> 14:06.344
Got a couple of

14:06.478 --> 14:07.178
little pegs, like this.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.012
Yeah.

14:08.147 --> 14:08.847
Follow my lead.

14:08.981 --> 14:09.681
Okay.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.149
I come from a long line of

14:11.283 --> 14:12.283
carpenters so I'd better

14:12.318 --> 14:13.318
be good at this.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.058
No way.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.293
That's so cool.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.262
How cool is that?

14:32.538 --> 14:34.272
Butterfly is climbing this

14:34.406 --> 14:35.440
palm tree to get us

14:35.574 --> 14:37.008
some tools.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.510
Alright, look.

14:39.645 --> 14:40.445
Look what he's

14:40.579 --> 14:41.379
doing here, Red.

14:41.513 --> 14:42.247
My gosh.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.514
This is going to be hard.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.416
Okay.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.551
Butterfly?

14:50.222 --> 14:51.389
Hi, Butterfly.

14:51.523 --> 14:52.557
Hello.

14:52.691 --> 14:53.691
Hello!

14:55.928 --> 14:57.262
Look at him up there.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.396
Wow.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.530
So, we start out with it

14:59.665 --> 15:00.999
facing down, then we

15:01.133 --> 15:02.600
cross them over.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.235
I'm an artist and I crochet

15:04.370 --> 15:06.437
crazy things out of yarn.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.606
I started out just because I

15:08.741 --> 15:10.541
love to crochet so much, now I

15:10.676 --> 15:12.110
create content for big brands

15:12.244 --> 15:13.811
all over the country.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.079
So, when I saw the weaving

15:15.214 --> 15:16.447
challenge I was like, we got

15:16.582 --> 15:17.348
this nailed, super competent.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.523
London's about to weave

15:18.617 --> 15:19.697
circles around all of these

15:19.752 --> 15:20.451
fools.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.220
Yeah.

15:22.354 --> 15:23.588
Okay.

15:23.722 --> 15:24.422
Got it?

15:24.556 --> 15:25.256
Okay, yup.

15:25.391 --> 15:26.090
They go right down there.

15:26.225 --> 15:26.991
Good?

15:27.126 --> 15:27.926
Yup, exactly.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.327
Want me to bang these in?

15:29.461 --> 15:31.429
There were a limited number of

15:31.563 --> 15:32.730
parts, they had to go in a

15:32.865 --> 15:34.098
certain order, and they had to

15:34.233 --> 15:35.900
go in a certain direction, or it

15:36.035 --> 15:36.768
wouldn't fit together.

15:36.902 --> 15:37.568
Lemme see.

15:37.703 --> 15:38.970
This is how it goes.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.138
Just like this.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.472
That's it right there.

15:41.607 --> 15:42.607
Around the next facing

15:42.708 --> 15:43.508
forward, so this is what

15:43.642 --> 15:44.909
the people see.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.244
I got you, got you.

15:46.378 --> 15:47.412
1, 2, 1, 2, 3.

15:47.546 --> 15:48.823
Just pull, just pull, just pull.

15:48.847 --> 15:49.547
Pull, pull.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.082
Damn, this does not want to

15:51.216 --> 15:52.617
line up, I don't know what to

15:52.751 --> 15:53.831
do, I'm getting frustrated.

15:53.919 --> 15:54.919
Don't get frustrated,

15:55.020 --> 15:55.753
it's just dowels and holes,

15:55.888 --> 15:56.888
that's it.

15:56.922 --> 15:57.956
I'm going in.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.090
No.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.158
No.

16:03.262 --> 16:04.382
You're okay, you're okay.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.097
I know, I know you got a

16:06.231 --> 16:06.931
splinter.

16:07.066 --> 16:08.066
No pain, no gain.

16:12.504 --> 16:13.504
I thought I would be

16:13.572 --> 16:14.739
good at this.

16:14.873 --> 16:15.707
You've just got to focus,

16:15.841 --> 16:16.975
that's all you got to do.

16:17.109 --> 16:17.809
I'm freaking out.

16:17.943 --> 16:19.477
And I shouldn't, that doesn't

16:19.611 --> 16:20.778
help anything.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.246
Whomp-whomp.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.681
It's not working.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.216
It all fell apart.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.185
Logan, are they doing it?

16:27.319 --> 16:28.186
Yeah.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.587
Dude, I got this.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.789
Just stick it up.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.044
You really can't do this?

16:33.092 --> 16:34.135
Just worried that I'm not

16:34.159 --> 16:35.393
getting the technique and I

16:35.527 --> 16:36.728
don't want to be here too long

16:36.862 --> 16:38.796
and then another team show up.

16:38.931 --> 16:39.664
We need to switch.

16:39.798 --> 16:40.465
You want to?

16:40.599 --> 16:41.332
Yes.

16:41.467 --> 16:42.133
Okay, let's go.

16:42.267 --> 16:43.427
Yeah, we're going to go to

16:43.469 --> 16:44.135
build it.

16:44.269 --> 16:45.003
Dammit, dammit, dammit.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.437
We're, switching.

16:46.572 --> 16:47.849
This is kind of embarrassing but

16:47.873 --> 16:49.173
I got nervous.

16:49.308 --> 16:50.675
But we don't want to waste any

16:50.809 --> 16:51.509
more time.

16:51.643 --> 16:52.844
Wow, they just switched

16:52.978 --> 16:54.212
detours.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.457
Decided it would make more

16:55.481 --> 16:56.247
sense because then it's not

16:56.382 --> 16:57.081
sticking out.

16:57.216 --> 16:58.326
That's going to come out,

16:58.350 --> 16:59.550
it's going to hook in with the

16:59.685 --> 17:00.795
end pieces right there over that

17:00.819 --> 17:01.519
flat one.

17:01.653 --> 17:02.797
This side's facing up, right?

17:02.821 --> 17:03.521
Should be?

17:03.655 --> 17:04.689
The side should be

17:04.823 --> 17:05.823
facing that way.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.791
This is not going to work.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.260
It's going to pop right out.

17:09.395 --> 17:10.261
Brooke is very negative.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.396
Like, this is designed

17:11.530 --> 17:12.195
to fail.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.265
I'm glad that we've got a

17:14.400 --> 17:15.400
positive team.

17:15.501 --> 17:16.644
Where's a marked workstation?

17:16.667 --> 17:17.468
It's down here.

17:17.603 --> 17:18.636
There it is.

17:18.771 --> 17:19.537
You guys switched?

17:19.671 --> 17:20.505
Yeah, it's hard.

17:20.638 --> 17:21.638
Wow.

17:21.673 --> 17:22.673
All right. One more.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.008
We're crushing this, Liz.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.143
We're doing good.

17:25.243 --> 17:26.411
We just have to flip this

17:26.545 --> 17:27.244
around.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.378
So the round part

17:28.480 --> 17:29.180
is against the back.

17:29.314 --> 17:30.014
Yes.

17:30.149 --> 17:31.349
And we will be good to go.

17:31.483 --> 17:32.560
I'm glad you're my partner.

17:32.584 --> 17:33.751
I do alright in a pinch.

17:33.886 --> 17:34.585
Okay, that's it.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.920
That's as good as

17:36.055 --> 17:37.055
it's going to get.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.357
We need an inspector.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.559
Hopefully he'll be lenient.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.200
No good.

17:49.334 --> 17:50.068
No good?

17:50.202 --> 17:50.868
Okay.

17:51.003 --> 17:51.869
There is a peg missing.

17:52.004 --> 17:52.737
Peg missing, Mike.

17:52.871 --> 17:53.905
It dropped out when he

17:54.039 --> 17:54.739
was banging on it.

17:54.873 --> 17:55.973
What do you think?

17:56.108 --> 17:56.808
We good?

17:56.942 --> 17:57.942
I think so.

17:57.976 --> 17:58.810
Found it.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.311
Found peg, found peg, found peg.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.380
Check, please.

18:10.389 --> 18:11.389
Thank you.

18:11.523 --> 18:12.323
We need an inspector

18:12.458 --> 18:13.157
over here!

18:13.292 --> 18:14.469
We've got to bring two desks

18:14.493 --> 18:15.193
over.

18:15.327 --> 18:16.027
They've finished?

18:16.161 --> 18:16.861
How did they finish?

18:16.995 --> 18:17.695
Get underneath it.

18:17.830 --> 18:18.496
I am underneath it.

18:18.630 --> 18:19.363
Ready?

18:19.498 --> 18:20.698
Let's just go down here.

18:25.404 --> 18:26.270
Good.

18:26.405 --> 18:27.405
Yes!

18:27.539 --> 18:28.406
Thank you, my friend.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.475
Thank you, my friend!

18:32.478 --> 18:35.046
Right now, Matt's working on

18:35.180 --> 18:37.248
finishing that first one and

18:37.382 --> 18:39.383
I've gotten better so I'm just

18:39.518 --> 18:40.685
going to start weaving this

18:40.819 --> 18:42.086
second baskets.

18:42.221 --> 18:43.221
I think we're going to go

18:43.355 --> 18:44.355
a lot faster now.

18:44.389 --> 18:45.156
Want to jog?

18:45.290 --> 18:46.290
Or are you good?

18:46.325 --> 18:47.325
I'm good.

18:47.993 --> 18:48.693
Which fence,

18:48.827 --> 18:49.527
that one or this one?

18:49.661 --> 18:50.528
Go right through that fence

18:50.662 --> 18:51.362
right there.

18:51.497 --> 18:52.163
My gosh.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.030
You can't do it

18:53.165 --> 18:54.031
with one hand!

18:54.166 --> 18:55.433
I sure can, but you've

18:55.567 --> 18:56.567
got to talk to me.

18:58.570 --> 18:59.670
Be gentle.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.638
He is smacking ours

19:00.772 --> 19:01.539
really hard.

19:01.673 --> 19:02.673
Why?

19:02.741 --> 19:03.741
No.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.176
No good?

19:05.310 --> 19:06.310
We're missing a dowel.

19:06.411 --> 19:07.845
There was a big piece

19:07.980 --> 19:09.147
I just had.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.481
Check!

19:13.252 --> 19:14.519
Yes!

19:14.653 --> 19:16.354
We're drowning right now.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.922
No we're not.

19:18.056 --> 19:18.789
Everybody's ahead of us.

19:18.924 --> 19:19.724
Look.

19:19.858 --> 19:20.591
This goes like...

19:20.726 --> 19:21.859
Yes we are.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.194
We can do this.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.729
I'm glad we switched.

19:24.863 --> 19:25.963
Me too.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.242
I see the classroom, right

19:27.266 --> 19:28.366
ahead.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.200
Mkokotoni, that's it.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.601
Yeah?

19:30.736 --> 19:32.603
Coming down, good job.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.573
Hello!

19:37.309 --> 19:38.009
Watch the kids,

19:38.143 --> 19:39.310
watch the kids.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.488
Okay, bring it down slowly.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.679
Thank you.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.247
Good job.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.484
We have to learn four phrases.

20:06.104 --> 20:07.538
Thank you.

20:07.673 --> 20:08.773
Okay, other side, to the

20:08.907 --> 20:09.774
baskets.

20:09.908 --> 20:11.876
I'm already expecting that

20:12.010 --> 20:13.277
Seth Olive the are going to

20:13.412 --> 20:15.079
get to our station first.

20:15.214 --> 20:15.913
First, yup.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.748
We did not want to go against

20:17.883 --> 20:18.916
them if we were getting

20:19.051 --> 20:19.750
u-turned, and

20:19.885 --> 20:20.651
unfortunately, they are the

20:20.786 --> 20:21.896
other team that got u-turned.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.687
There they are.

20:22.821 --> 20:23.854
This the head guy?

20:23.989 --> 20:25.189
Dammit.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.125
Seth Olive are a very

20:28.260 --> 20:30.094
strong team but Seth, he might

20:30.229 --> 20:31.762
not do well on this because his

20:31.897 --> 20:33.197
cop skills are going to come

20:33.332 --> 20:34.332
into play.

20:34.466 --> 20:35.132
Eight palm fronds,

20:35.267 --> 20:35.967
and four palm sprigs.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.668
I think is going to try and

20:37.803 --> 20:38.803
shoot this or arrest it.

20:38.870 --> 20:39.570
You want shade?

20:39.705 --> 20:40.438
Yes.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.906
He's going to try to detain

20:42.040 --> 20:42.740
the basket.

20:42.874 --> 20:44.275
He's just not going to know what

20:44.409 --> 20:45.409
to do.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.678
Let's see how they start it.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.013
They start from the bottom.

20:51.149 --> 20:52.149
I just heard

20:52.217 --> 20:52.917
"hakuna matata".

20:53.051 --> 20:54.518
He's just letting us know, we

20:54.653 --> 20:55.353
should have no worries.

20:55.487 --> 20:56.187
Hello.

20:56.321 --> 20:59.490
I'm going at your pace.

21:00.859 --> 21:02.003
I'm not a dude, I'm sorry.

21:02.027 --> 21:02.760
I know. I know.

21:02.894 --> 21:03.628
My God.

21:03.762 --> 21:04.872
Watch the big step, yeah?

21:04.896 --> 21:06.097
Hi, hello.

21:07.399 --> 21:08.399
Got it?

21:08.433 --> 21:09.500
I'm in.

21:09.635 --> 21:10.701
Excuse me!

21:10.836 --> 21:12.670
Coming through, look at you

21:12.804 --> 21:14.272
guys, you're so beautiful.

21:14.406 --> 21:15.106
Wow.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.274
Hello, everybody.

21:16.408 --> 21:18.342
Thank you.

21:18.477 --> 21:19.844
Let's get this thing down.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.453
Safari njema!

21:30.589 --> 21:31.455
Yeah!

21:31.590 --> 21:32.790
Thank you very much.

21:32.924 --> 21:33.924
Thank you.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.926
Okay, one, two...

21:36.061 --> 21:37.295
"Travel by taxi to Darajani."

21:37.429 --> 21:38.696
Market; Once there, search for

21:38.830 --> 21:40.064
your clue near the front

21:40.198 --> 21:41.065
"entrance."

21:41.199 --> 21:42.199
Yep, okay.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.601
Alright, nice job.

21:43.735 --> 21:44.568
Judge?

21:44.703 --> 21:45.936
Master Weaver?

21:46.071 --> 21:47.805
They look great?

21:47.939 --> 21:49.206
Look at those!

21:49.341 --> 21:50.408
Yeah.

21:52.878 --> 21:53.744
Good?

21:53.879 --> 21:54.745
Yeah?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.714
Thank you, let's go.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.216
Kwaherini.

21:59.285 --> 22:00.384
"Kwaherini."

22:01.586 --> 22:02.653
Yeah, whoo!

22:02.788 --> 22:03.654
You're wonderful.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.323
Thank you so much.

22:05.457 --> 22:06.524
Thank you.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.093
That was awesome!

22:09.227 --> 22:10.294
They're so cute!

22:10.429 --> 22:11.529
There it is.

22:11.663 --> 22:12.830
We're almost there.

22:12.964 --> 22:14.065
It's not over yet.

22:14.199 --> 22:15.633
No.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.735
It's the boys.

22:17.869 --> 22:19.704
This looks good.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.173
That one was loose.

22:22.307 --> 22:23.384
The other one's loose, too.

22:23.408 --> 22:24.408
I think it's good.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.677
Yeah, nice.

22:26.812 --> 22:27.855
Where do we start, guys?

22:27.879 --> 22:29.039
We've got to get a section

22:29.147 --> 22:30.014
thing.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.388
We showed up expecting to be

22:31.450 --> 22:32.316
last...

22:32.451 --> 22:33.451
To be alone.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.385
And we weren't.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.653
That was such a confidence

22:35.787 --> 22:36.654
booster.

22:36.788 --> 22:38.656
If we can beat a team, that

22:38.790 --> 22:39.890
would be amazing right now.

22:40.025 --> 22:40.891
I'm dying.

22:41.026 --> 22:41.892
You're amazing.

22:42.027 --> 22:42.893
Look, we did it.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.128
Good job on the building.

22:44.262 --> 22:45.730
We didn't do anything yet.

22:46.865 --> 22:47.732
Are you okay?

22:47.866 --> 22:48.699
What are you ing?

22:48.834 --> 22:49.700
Nothing, keep going.

22:49.835 --> 22:50.701
Good!

22:50.836 --> 22:52.937
Good, thank you.

22:54.072 --> 22:57.441
Yeah!!!

22:57.576 --> 22:58.442
Yes!

22:58.577 --> 22:59.443
Thank you!

22:59.578 --> 23:00.778
Thank you, thank you, thank

23:00.846 --> 23:01.712
you.

23:01.847 --> 23:02.857
Okay, bang that through.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.281
You don't want to make the

23:04.416 --> 23:05.282
hole too big.

23:05.417 --> 23:06.657
I know, but we've got to get

23:06.752 --> 23:07.618
it through.

23:07.753 --> 23:08.619
You see my point?

23:08.754 --> 23:09.620
You see my point?

23:09.755 --> 23:10.621
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

23:10.756 --> 23:11.622
Yeah, you see my point?

23:11.757 --> 23:12.890
Okay!

23:13.024 --> 23:16.327
Asante sana, thank you!

23:16.461 --> 23:17.294
Asante!

23:17.429 --> 23:18.295
Come on, Brooke.

23:18.430 --> 23:19.697
I'm right behind you.

23:19.831 --> 23:20.831
Go, I'm running.

23:22.434 --> 23:23.300
Straight, keep going.

23:23.435 --> 23:24.595
Don't answer your phone right

23:24.703 --> 23:25.703
now, please, keep going!

23:25.737 --> 23:26.737
Keep going, straight.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.506
We want to stop right in front

23:28.640 --> 23:29.507
of that umbrella.

23:29.641 --> 23:30.681
"Who's ready to do some"

23:30.776 --> 23:31.642
"market research?"

23:31.777 --> 23:33.711
Due to a lack of

23:33.845 --> 23:35.045
refrigeration, most locals buy

23:35.180 --> 23:37.314
their dinner fresh daily in

23:37.449 --> 23:39.116
vibrant marketplaces like this.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.419
Following a shopping list, teams

23:41.553 --> 23:43.721
must purchase an assortment of

23:43.855 --> 23:45.756
local items, then deliver it all

23:45.891 --> 23:47.391
to the family chef for their

23:47.526 --> 23:48.392
next clue.

23:48.527 --> 23:50.561
Alright, Joey!

23:51.696 --> 23:53.063
I'll do it, it might be food.

23:53.198 --> 23:54.031
I need leg money.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.032
You need leg money?

23:55.167 --> 23:56.534
I know what most of the stuff

23:56.668 --> 23:57.902
is, so I just gotta find it.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.136
Nyanya chungu?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.404
What is that?

24:00.539 --> 24:03.140
I have never in my life seen

24:03.275 --> 24:05.676
or heard of anything like this.

24:05.811 --> 24:06.944
I'm really worried about the

24:07.078 --> 24:07.945
language issue here.

24:08.079 --> 24:09.346
Let's try to focus on just

24:09.481 --> 24:10.591
this, there's nothing we can do

24:10.615 --> 24:11.759
about anything else but work the

24:11.783 --> 24:13.083
best we can right now and not

24:13.218 --> 24:14.084
get aggravated.

24:14.219 --> 24:15.085
Just racing against

24:15.220 --> 24:16.086
ourselves.

24:16.221 --> 24:17.755
Let's go.

24:17.889 --> 24:19.423
Safari njema.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.059
Habari yako?

24:22.194 --> 24:23.661
Habari yako.

24:24.830 --> 24:27.031
Thank you, thank you.

24:27.165 --> 24:28.232
Thank you, asante.

24:28.366 --> 24:29.233
Taxi!

24:29.367 --> 24:30.234
Taxi?

24:30.368 --> 24:31.602
Where can we get a taxi?

24:31.736 --> 24:33.637
She has a clue for us.

24:33.772 --> 24:34.638
Yay!

24:34.773 --> 24:35.639
Asante sana!

24:35.774 --> 24:36.640
Asante sana.

24:36.775 --> 24:37.942
Thank you so much.

24:39.845 --> 24:41.212
Wait, this is the seat...

24:41.346 --> 24:42.413
Wait, this is the seat.

24:42.547 --> 24:43.414
Is it?

24:43.548 --> 24:46.050
It is, it is, it is.

24:46.184 --> 24:47.184
Judge, judge?

24:47.319 --> 24:48.552
Good job, guys!

24:48.687 --> 24:50.287
You guys killed that.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.288
Thanks!

24:51.423 --> 24:52.990
Put it at the same time.

24:53.124 --> 24:54.124
Hold on, hold on.

24:54.259 --> 24:55.993
We're good, we're good, we're

24:56.127 --> 24:57.228
good about this one.

24:57.362 --> 24:58.429
Don't leave me hanging.

24:58.563 --> 24:59.563
There we go.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.702
Yeah!

25:04.836 --> 25:05.836
Wow, that was so fast.

25:05.904 --> 25:06.770
That's okay.

25:06.905 --> 25:08.182
We have to get some traction.

25:08.206 --> 25:09.073
We're not moving right now.

25:09.207 --> 25:10.207
Come on!

25:10.342 --> 25:11.709
Just keep going.

25:11.843 --> 25:12.843
Yeah, bud!

25:12.978 --> 25:15.045
It's not over, we're killing it.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.050
I think you're doing it

25:20.185 --> 25:21.051
right.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.286
I don't know, Seth, I'm

25:22.420 --> 25:23.287
getting wicked stressed now.

25:23.421 --> 25:24.621
Seth and Olive are finished

25:24.723 --> 25:26.123
and they're on the other one, so

25:26.258 --> 25:27.301
right now we're very behind.

25:27.325 --> 25:28.325
Sara, come on, push.

25:28.460 --> 25:29.793
You realise I haven't

25:29.928 --> 25:30.794
stopped, right?!

25:30.929 --> 25:31.929
We're in last!

25:32.030 --> 25:33.430
If somebody finishes that weave,

25:33.565 --> 25:34.565
we're out!

25:38.303 --> 25:39.403
How's it going?

25:39.538 --> 25:40.971
I'm doing good, yeah?

25:41.106 --> 25:42.206
Okay, good, yeah.

25:42.340 --> 25:43.974
We're just going to get these

25:44.109 --> 25:45.609
baskets tied up and then have

25:45.744 --> 25:46.610
them checked.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.245
And then hopefully we make

25:48.380 --> 25:49.880
good enough time that we stay

25:50.015 --> 25:50.881
in.

25:51.016 --> 25:52.716
We are completing our second

25:52.851 --> 25:54.218
table, and I'm hoping that

25:54.352 --> 25:55.219
they're both perfect, because

25:55.353 --> 25:56.987
we've been at this for a while.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.693
Do you have white snapper?

26:02.827 --> 26:03.827
I need one, please.

26:03.962 --> 26:05.129
Very good.

26:05.263 --> 26:06.263
This is all food.

26:06.331 --> 26:07.197
Yeah.

26:07.332 --> 26:08.409
Mike knows everything about

26:08.433 --> 26:09.600
it, so he's gonna nail it.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.001
I love it here.

26:11.136 --> 26:12.436
I feel like I'm at home.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.437
This is awesome.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.805
A live chicken?

26:14.940 --> 26:15.806
Make it halal?

26:15.941 --> 26:17.174
What does that mean?

26:17.309 --> 26:18.442
Live chicken, live?

26:18.577 --> 26:19.443
Some chickens...

26:19.578 --> 26:21.879
I don't usually do the shopping

26:22.013 --> 26:23.047
for my family.

26:23.181 --> 26:24.248
This is insane.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.819
Come on, Vanck, come on.

26:28.954 --> 26:29.820
"Shop..."

26:29.955 --> 26:31.455
You've got this, this is you.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.590
Okay, I've got it.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.258
Can I have a basket?

26:34.392 --> 26:35.225
Thank you.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.994
One pomelo, one nyanya chungu?

26:37.128 --> 26:38.796
I don't know what all of these

26:38.930 --> 26:39.797
things are.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.298
My god, this is... this

26:41.433 --> 26:42.299
doesn't look quite right.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.702
Red bananas, red bananas?

26:44.836 --> 26:46.604
These are yellow bananas.

26:46.738 --> 26:47.738
Fast fast fast.

26:47.806 --> 26:49.573
I think we may have even beat

26:49.708 --> 26:51.175
Seth and Olive, but if not,

26:51.309 --> 26:52.743
we're in front of Shamir and

26:52.877 --> 26:54.345
Sara right now, so that's huge.

26:54.479 --> 26:56.213
We're not in last place, and

26:56.348 --> 26:57.214
that is huge.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.216
Wow, that took a long time.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.551
I know it did.

27:01.686 --> 27:02.553
Yes?

27:02.687 --> 27:03.554
Thank you, thank you!

27:03.688 --> 27:04.521
It's happening.

27:04.656 --> 27:05.833
How about you carry it from

27:05.857 --> 27:06.690
the bottom?

27:06.825 --> 27:07.945
I'm going to hold it from

27:08.026 --> 27:08.892
here, come to the back... just

27:09.027 --> 27:09.893
hold the back.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.028
Hold... hold the back!

27:11.062 --> 27:11.929
I got it.

27:12.063 --> 27:12.930
You have to help too.

27:13.064 --> 27:13.897
Sara!

27:14.032 --> 27:14.898
, it's gonna drop.

27:15.033 --> 27:16.433
No no no no no, I've got it,

27:16.568 --> 27:17.434
I've got it.

27:17.569 --> 27:18.435
Sara, hold on, you're pushing

27:18.570 --> 27:19.436
me down.

27:19.571 --> 27:20.437
You're pushing me... you're

27:20.572 --> 27:21.438
adding 85 million pounds!

27:21.573 --> 27:22.439
What are you doing?

27:22.574 --> 27:23.440
I'm holding it up.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.376
I think we're pretty close.

27:25.510 --> 27:27.611
We're, going to get a check

27:27.746 --> 27:29.279
here; Just waiting for Olive to

27:29.414 --> 27:30.414
get her handle on.

27:30.548 --> 27:32.049
"Who's ready to do some"

27:32.183 --> 27:33.050
"market research?"

27:33.184 --> 27:34.418
I do finance; Okay, me.

27:34.552 --> 27:35.419
I'm ready.

27:35.553 --> 27:36.597
"Search the markets for the"

27:36.621 --> 27:37.488
ingredients for tonight's

27:37.622 --> 27:38.666
"dinner," I'm going to do it.

27:38.690 --> 27:39.556
Hey, you guys.

27:39.691 --> 27:40.557
Let's do it together.

27:40.692 --> 27:41.769
Alright, okay, we have to

27:41.793 --> 27:42.660
bang this out.

27:42.794 --> 27:45.129
How many packets of mchicha?

27:45.263 --> 27:46.397
Two bunches.

27:46.531 --> 27:47.731
If we can get everything here,

27:47.766 --> 27:48.846
like, that I can, that'd be

27:48.967 --> 27:50.267
great; I'll pay you all at once.

27:50.402 --> 27:51.562
Looks like I may have hit the

27:51.636 --> 27:52.503
jackpot.

27:52.637 --> 27:53.648
I'm telling a couple of guys

27:53.672 --> 27:54.538
what I need, and they're

27:54.673 --> 27:55.539
grabbing everything for me.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.674
Do you have matches?

27:56.808 --> 27:57.675
Matchbox?

27:57.809 --> 27:58.676
Yeah, matches.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.177
Can you bring it, too?

28:00.311 --> 28:02.146
Wow, these guys are awesome.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.580
I need a chicken.

28:03.715 --> 28:04.825
Chicken market, chicken chicken

28:04.849 --> 28:05.929
chicken chicken, excuse me.

28:05.984 --> 28:07.518
I'm after one live chicken.

28:08.820 --> 28:09.820
Yeah, is that halal?

28:09.954 --> 28:10.988
Yeah, this is halal.

28:11.122 --> 28:11.989
Halal chicken, yes.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.624
Is it going to run away?

28:13.758 --> 28:14.902
How much will six bunches be,

28:14.926 --> 28:15.793
sir?

28:15.927 --> 28:16.794
Ten thousand only?

28:16.928 --> 28:18.128
I'm going to do everybody's

28:18.229 --> 28:19.373
mchicha, and someone's going to

28:19.397 --> 28:20.397
pay for the next thing.

28:20.465 --> 28:21.331
Ten dollar.

28:21.466 --> 28:22.626
Yeah, that's $20 American,

28:22.667 --> 28:24.001
you know how much that is?

28:24.135 --> 28:25.736
That can't be $10 for just that.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.638
$45 for all.

28:27.772 --> 28:29.039
Forty-five dollars?

28:29.174 --> 28:30.974
I don't know if I can give you

28:31.109 --> 28:32.376
$45; Can I get $1 back?

28:32.510 --> 28:33.377
Please, please?

28:33.511 --> 28:34.511
Help a brother out.

28:34.579 --> 28:35.446
Thanks.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.314
Thank you, thank you so much.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.850
Man, there are so many

28:39.984 --> 28:40.851
umbrellas.

28:40.985 --> 28:41.852
It's right here.

28:41.986 --> 28:43.130
Alright, Matt's going to do

28:43.154 --> 28:44.154
this one.

28:44.189 --> 28:45.489
I'm going to do this one.

28:45.623 --> 28:46.490
Alright.

28:46.624 --> 28:47.491
Okay, here we go.

28:47.625 --> 28:48.492
I already paid for that.

28:48.626 --> 28:49.493
Wait, hold on.

28:49.627 --> 28:50.928
I may need some of you guys to

28:51.062 --> 28:51.895
chip in on this.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.130
I just paid $10 for 30

28:53.264 --> 28:54.098
bananas.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.392
Yeah, but I paid 10,000 on

28:55.467 --> 28:56.800
the last thing, and I got us six

28:56.935 --> 28:57.801
different ingredients.

28:57.936 --> 28:58.802
Snapper, coconut, red

28:58.937 --> 28:59.803
bananas; I think we're

28:59.938 --> 29:00.804
definitely still in it.

29:00.939 --> 29:02.339
This is huge for us, especially

29:02.474 --> 29:04.141
if I can knock this one out

29:04.275 --> 29:05.142
right now.

29:05.276 --> 29:06.143
One.

29:06.277 --> 29:07.478
Just one... that's a pomelo?

29:07.612 --> 29:08.479
Yeah, pomelo.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.080
Let's see if this is it.

29:10.215 --> 29:11.315
There's Joey.

29:11.449 --> 29:12.316
Where?

29:12.450 --> 29:14.418
Yay, Joey, nice chicken!

29:14.552 --> 29:15.552
Did you see Mike?

29:15.620 --> 29:16.954
I didn't see him at all.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.088
It's a maze in there.

29:18.156 --> 29:19.256
Good job, Joey!

29:19.390 --> 29:21.225
Are you sure that you have

29:21.359 --> 29:22.226
everything?

29:22.360 --> 29:24.428
I... I got everything.

29:24.562 --> 29:25.429
All done?

29:25.563 --> 29:26.563
No, that... halal.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.232
This isn't... this needs to be

29:28.366 --> 29:29.233
halal chicken?

29:29.367 --> 29:30.734
The guy said it was halal.

29:30.869 --> 29:33.537
One, one please, halal.

29:33.671 --> 29:34.671
Halal?

29:34.739 --> 29:35.739
Yeah.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.341
Yeah, yeah, please.

29:37.475 --> 29:38.342
Alright, no problem.

29:38.476 --> 29:39.343
Let's go.

29:39.477 --> 29:40.344
Halal?

29:40.478 --> 29:41.345
Halal, halal.

29:41.479 --> 29:42.479
Halal is the method of

29:42.580 --> 29:43.447
slaughtering.

29:43.581 --> 29:44.982
A lot of people get freaked out,

29:45.116 --> 29:46.517
but where do you think it came

29:46.651 --> 29:48.018
from when you get it in the

29:48.153 --> 29:49.019
grocery store, dude?

29:49.154 --> 29:50.521
It was alive one day; At least

29:50.655 --> 29:51.655
this is honest about it.

29:51.723 --> 29:52.767
Okay; Right here, my friend,

29:52.791 --> 29:53.657
thank you.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.159
Sara, Sara, hold on, this

29:55.293 --> 29:56.693
desk is smashing into my face.

29:56.828 --> 29:57.694
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:57.829 --> 29:58.695
Thank you!

29:58.830 --> 29:59.990
Thank you guys, thank you!

30:00.031 --> 30:01.565
"Travel by taxi to the Darajani.

30:01.699 --> 30:02.566
Market in Stone Town."

30:02.700 --> 30:03.901
Hold that, let's go.

30:04.035 --> 30:04.902
Saeed!

30:05.036 --> 30:06.236
Yeah, thank god.

30:06.371 --> 30:08.305
The only possible team that

30:08.439 --> 30:11.008
could still be doing a detour is

30:11.142 --> 30:12.009
Seth and Olive.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.410
If not, we're in last.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.279
Check, please.

30:20.385 --> 30:21.919
Thank you very much.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.655
This is him.

30:24.789 --> 30:26.029
We're going to Darajani Market.

30:26.057 --> 30:27.157
Very fast, if possible,

30:27.292 --> 30:28.158
please.

30:28.293 --> 30:29.159
Very, very fast.

30:29.294 --> 30:30.294
We fell behind.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.996
Way to go, way to go!

30:33.131 --> 30:33.997
One halal chicken.

30:34.132 --> 30:35.766
White snapper, whole.

30:35.900 --> 30:39.303
Did you do it?

30:39.437 --> 30:40.304
Yes!

30:40.438 --> 30:41.438
Thank you very much.

30:41.573 --> 30:42.853
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

30:42.974 --> 30:43.841
We the first?

30:43.975 --> 30:44.842
Yep, we're first.

30:44.976 --> 30:46.577
"Make your way to the next"

30:46.711 --> 30:47.578
"pit stop."

30:47.712 --> 30:50.380
Zanzibar is famous for its

30:50.515 --> 30:51.381
rooftop hotels.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.017
This one, built in the 1870s,

30:54.152 --> 30:56.253
overlooks Stone Town and is now

30:56.387 --> 30:57.855
the pit stop for this leg of the

30:57.989 --> 30:58.856
race.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.325
The last team to check in here

31:01.459 --> 31:02.459
may be eliminated.

31:02.493 --> 31:03.794
I'm so proud of you.

31:03.928 --> 31:04.761
Knuckles.

31:04.896 --> 31:06.496
We've just got to get there

31:06.631 --> 31:07.497
before Joey and Tara.

31:07.632 --> 31:08.632
Yes!

31:08.733 --> 31:11.268
You did it, whoa!

31:11.402 --> 31:12.870
Thank you.

31:14.005 --> 31:15.973
Okay, I've got a taxi.

31:16.107 --> 31:17.307
Alright, let's go.

31:17.442 --> 31:18.442
I have one more thing.

31:18.576 --> 31:19.443
Halal chicken.

31:19.577 --> 31:20.657
I actually know what it is,

31:20.745 --> 31:21.612
actually, because in New York.

31:21.746 --> 31:22.613
State, there's Halal Chicken.

31:22.747 --> 31:23.614
One banana tea.

31:23.748 --> 31:24.615
Haluwa, good.

31:24.749 --> 31:25.749
Box of matches, okay.

31:25.783 --> 31:26.783
Is tungule dogo.

31:26.818 --> 31:27.684
Okay.

31:27.819 --> 31:29.186
I bring you one pomelo and a

31:29.320 --> 31:30.187
red banana, okay?

31:30.321 --> 31:31.398
Okay, very fast, very fast.

31:31.422 --> 31:32.289
I'm doing pretty well.

31:32.423 --> 31:33.623
Only got a few left, so that's

31:33.725 --> 31:34.558
pretty awesome.

31:34.692 --> 31:35.893
I paid 50,000 for my chili.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.160
I've been paying American

31:37.295 --> 31:38.695
dollars and I think I've been

31:38.830 --> 31:39.696
getting screwed.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.031
That's... that's $250, $250.

31:41.132 --> 31:42.499
Okay, we good?

31:42.634 --> 31:44.635
Make it $300.

31:44.769 --> 31:45.769
$250.

31:45.803 --> 31:46.803
Please.

31:47.805 --> 31:48.849
We're running low on money.

31:48.873 --> 31:49.873
"Use your leg money to"

31:49.908 --> 31:50.774
purchase the items on your

31:50.909 --> 31:51.775
"list."

31:51.910 --> 31:52.776
My god.

31:52.911 --> 31:53.777
Shoot.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.879
I'm gonna run out of money.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.080
We're booking it!

31:57.215 --> 31:59.483
Alright, now we gotta get to the

31:59.617 --> 32:00.484
roof.

32:00.618 --> 32:02.753
Come on, Mike, you got it.

32:02.887 --> 32:03.754
Help!

32:03.888 --> 32:06.023
It's like climbing a mountain up

32:06.157 --> 32:07.157
here, isn't it?

32:08.126 --> 32:09.660
Welcome to Zanzibar.

32:09.794 --> 32:11.795
Thank you very much.

32:11.930 --> 32:12.996
This is beautiful.

32:13.131 --> 32:13.997
Listen, Michael, I am pleased

32:14.132 --> 32:15.292

And I have some great

news for you...

32:20.538 --> 32:21.605
That's two in a row!

32:21.739 --> 32:23.040
As the winners of this leg

32:23.174 --> 32:24.675

32:24.809 --> 32:25.819

32:25.843 --> 32:26.923

32:29.748 --> 32:31.148
You're going to spend

32:34.987 --> 32:36.753

Well, it's official... so far

32:46.864 --> 32:48.432
you are the best performing team

32:48.566 --> 32:49.299
on this race.

32:49.434 --> 32:51.568
Not bad for as terrible as we

32:51.703 --> 32:53.270
were on the first lay?

32:53.404 --> 32:54.404
Ashton, we're done!

32:55.073 --> 32:55.772
Yeah, Vanck!

32:55.907 --> 32:56.940
Will I find fish that

32:57.075 --> 32:57.774
way?

32:57.909 --> 32:58.608
Yeah, yeah, you can

32:58.743 --> 32:59.443
find it there.

32:59.577 --> 33:00.277
Find fish? Okay.

33:00.411 --> 33:01.278
Then I need one more thing.

33:01.412 --> 33:02.612
4,000? Can I do three,

33:02.747 --> 33:03.981
because I have a long list

33:04.115 --> 33:05.315
and I don't have much money?

33:05.450 --> 33:06.149
Okay, okay.

33:06.284 --> 33:07.284
Thank you so much.

33:07.418 --> 33:08.698
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

33:08.820 --> 33:09.519
thank you. Asante.

33:09.654 --> 33:10.387
We need small

33:10.521 --> 33:11.254
tomatoes.

33:11.389 --> 33:12.389
Now is not the season.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.557
Now is not the season?

33:13.691 --> 33:14.992
Yeah, not the season of these

33:15.126 --> 33:16.126
tomatoes.

33:17.595 --> 33:18.595
Okay, I need eight.

33:18.696 --> 33:19.363
Eight.

33:19.497 --> 33:20.697
Where do we get them?

33:20.832 --> 33:21.832
Okay, here we go.

33:21.899 --> 33:22.939
I think we got everything.

33:22.967 --> 33:23.700
Good job, Matt.

33:23.835 --> 33:24.534
Killing it.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.402
Matt's getting it.

33:25.536 --> 33:26.236
He's, like, almost done.

33:26.371 --> 33:28.572
You're doing fantastic, Matt.

33:28.706 --> 33:29.406
Yeah!

33:29.540 --> 33:30.774
Thank you!

33:32.310 --> 33:33.010
Alright, woo.

33:33.144 --> 33:34.144
How did he finish?

33:34.212 --> 33:35.445
Warning, the last team to

33:35.580 --> 33:36.660
check in may be eliminated.

33:36.714 --> 33:37.447
Alright, we're ready.

33:37.582 --> 33:38.281
Let's go.

33:38.416 --> 33:39.916
Two Detours and a Roadblock

33:40.051 --> 33:41.585
before all of us did one

33:41.719 --> 33:42.419
of each.

33:42.553 --> 33:43.253
What?

33:43.388 --> 33:44.521
Come on.

33:44.655 --> 33:45.422
Down here, right?

33:45.556 --> 33:47.024
I think so.

33:47.158 --> 33:47.891
Here it is.

33:48.026 --> 33:48.825
Emerson on Hurumzi.

33:48.960 --> 33:49.693
Woo!

33:49.827 --> 33:50.827
My god.

33:50.862 --> 33:51.528
Yeah.

33:51.662 --> 33:52.396
Come on.

33:52.530 --> 33:53.196
Woo!

33:53.331 --> 33:54.031
Hi, Phil.

33:54.165 --> 33:55.432
How are you doing?

33:55.566 --> 33:56.333
Woo!

33:56.467 --> 33:58.402
Wow.

33:58.536 --> 33:59.236
There you go.

33:59.370 --> 34:00.570
Tara and Joey, I am pleased to

34:00.705 --> 34:01.745
tell you that you are team

34:01.839 --> 34:02.539
number two!

34:02.673 --> 34:03.373
Yes!

34:03.508 --> 34:04.508
Congratulations.

34:04.575 --> 34:06.276
Good job today, partner.

34:06.411 --> 34:07.744
Good work.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.112
Thank you.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.181
Thank you so much.

34:12.315 --> 34:13.717
Yeah, girl!

34:13.851 --> 34:14.951
Thank you.

34:15.085 --> 34:15.786
Let's go.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.054
Taxi!

34:17.188 --> 34:18.188
Abdul!

34:18.856 --> 34:19.856
Yes, Abdul! Abdul!

34:20.491 --> 34:21.771
Alright, go up a little more.

34:21.893 --> 34:22.692
The red and yellow umbrella

34:22.827 --> 34:23.493
right there.

34:23.628 --> 34:24.393
Let's go, Olive!

34:24.529 --> 34:25.228
Right there.

34:25.362 --> 34:26.063
Olive Right there.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.431
I have a thousand dollars.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.799
That is not enough.

34:28.933 --> 34:29.632
Shoot.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.168
I have to go and see if they'll

34:31.302 --> 34:32.379
give me money back from the

34:32.402 --> 34:33.443
other places that I bought

34:33.538 --> 34:35.072
because I ran out of money.

34:35.206 --> 34:35.906
This sucks.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.507
I have $20 on me, so...

34:38.643 --> 34:40.110
Give him Brazilian...

34:40.244 --> 34:40.976
Okay, okay.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.179
Let's go, Olive!

34:42.313 --> 34:43.313
Go!

34:43.414 --> 34:44.114
I need help.

34:44.248 --> 34:44.981
Yeah, I'll help you.

34:45.116 --> 34:46.260
You guys charged me too much

34:46.284 --> 34:47.460
because the rest of the stuff is

34:47.485 --> 34:48.629
cheaper and I ran out of money.

34:48.652 --> 34:49.797
Seth and Olive just showed

34:49.821 --> 34:50.520
up.

34:50.655 --> 34:51.321
Sara's having some problems.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.722
We ran out of money, so she's

34:52.857 --> 34:53.690
trying to negotiate with these

34:53.824 --> 34:55.158
people here and see if she can

34:55.293 --> 34:56.126
get the remaining items she

34:56.260 --> 34:56.993
needs.

34:57.128 --> 34:57.794
Very stressful.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.106
If they push through this right

34:59.130 --> 34:59.830
now, we're done.

34:59.964 --> 35:01.465
I would like some money back.

35:01.599 --> 35:02.666
No, no, no.

35:02.800 --> 35:03.834
Please, please, please.

35:03.968 --> 35:05.268
I don't have any money.

35:10.308 --> 35:12.042
I did good business.

35:12.176 --> 35:13.210
I did good business.

35:13.344 --> 35:14.845
So what can I help you?

35:14.979 --> 35:16.446
I would like some money back.

35:16.581 --> 35:17.614
No, no, no.

35:17.748 --> 35:18.548
Please, please, please.

35:18.683 --> 35:19.783
I ran out of money.

35:24.255 --> 35:24.955
Please.

35:25.089 --> 35:26.623
I don't have any money; I don't

35:26.757 --> 35:27.491
have any money.

35:27.625 --> 35:28.692
What is this?

35:28.826 --> 35:29.626
Pomelo.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.094
This is a pomelo; Okay.

35:31.229 --> 35:32.562
Nutmeg. Four, five... I need one

35:32.697 --> 35:34.030
more of those. These guys are

35:34.165 --> 35:34.998
helping me out huge.

35:35.133 --> 35:35.966
Thank god for them.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.367
You know what can I do.

35:39.403 --> 35:40.103
Good, good, good.

35:40.238 --> 35:40.937
Yay! Thank you!

35:41.072 --> 35:42.249
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

35:42.273 --> 35:42.973
Matt and Redmond...

35:43.107 --> 35:43.807
They're here already?

35:43.941 --> 35:44.641
No, they're done.

35:44.775 --> 35:46.076
They did this one too?

35:46.210 --> 35:46.910
Yes.

35:47.044 --> 35:48.044
Who's behind us?

35:48.146 --> 35:48.879
No one.

35:49.013 --> 35:49.713
We're last.

35:49.847 --> 35:50.847
We're dead last.

35:50.948 --> 35:52.516
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.017
Come on, Vanck, come on.

35:54.152 --> 35:54.885
Hakuna matata.

35:55.019 --> 35:56.019
Hakuna matata.

35:56.954 --> 35:58.155
Thank you, Abdul.

35:58.289 --> 35:59.756
Go, go, go, go.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.892
I see it, I see it.

36:02.026 --> 36:02.759
Emerson. Okay, we've

36:02.894 --> 36:04.261
got to go to the roof.

36:06.731 --> 36:07.430
Hey, Phil.

36:07.565 --> 36:08.398
Tell us what

36:08.533 --> 36:09.332
happened when you got to

36:09.467 --> 36:10.167
the U-Turn board today.

36:10.301 --> 36:11.001
We U-Turned

36:11.135 --> 36:11.835
Matt and Redmond.

36:11.969 --> 36:13.049
There was some bad blood

36:13.171 --> 36:14.314
between us and them from earlier

36:14.338 --> 36:15.038
in the race.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.239
I don't see why they're so

36:16.374 --> 36:17.073
surprised by it, honestly.

36:17.208 --> 36:18.208
We have another team

36:18.342 --> 36:19.042
coming in.

36:19.177 --> 36:19.943
It's right here.

36:20.077 --> 36:20.777
Okay.

36:20.912 --> 36:21.611
What's up, buddies?

36:21.746 --> 36:22.445
Good job.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.280
How's it going?

36:23.414 --> 36:25.115
This weak team next to us is

36:25.249 --> 36:26.716
two minutes ahead of us, and we

36:26.851 --> 36:28.091
did both Detours, so next time,

36:28.219 --> 36:29.419
I don't feel good for them.

36:29.554 --> 36:30.687
Why did you guys do that?

36:30.821 --> 36:31.861
You made the most sense

36:31.923 --> 36:32.589
to U-Turn because you

36:32.723 --> 36:33.456
lied to our faces.

36:33.591 --> 36:34.291
We didn't.

36:34.425 --> 36:35.158
Yes, you did.

36:35.293 --> 36:36.533
This is cool. I didn't think

36:36.561 --> 36:37.761
I was going to have any drama.

36:37.895 --> 36:38.595
Everybody likes us...

36:38.729 --> 36:39.429
Except for her.

36:39.564 --> 36:40.263
Well, except whenever

36:40.398 --> 36:41.398
you lie to my face.

36:41.432 --> 36:42.866
I live Vanck; I just

36:43.000 --> 36:43.700
don't like Ashton.

36:43.834 --> 36:45.035
I have plenty of

36:45.169 --> 36:45.869
other friends.

36:46.003 --> 36:46.703
Cool, great.

36:46.837 --> 36:47.537
We're fourth.

36:47.672 --> 36:48.371
I'm stoked.

36:48.506 --> 36:50.106
Hey, I think we're even now,

36:50.241 --> 36:50.941
right?

36:51.075 --> 36:51.775
Sure.

36:51.909 --> 36:52.609
Sure.

36:52.743 --> 36:53.743
Come on under

36:53.878 --> 36:54.578
the mat, guys.

36:54.712 --> 36:55.412
Nice!

36:55.546 --> 36:56.246
Yeah!

36:56.380 --> 36:57.180
Good job!

36:57.315 --> 36:58.682
Becca and Floyd, where's the

36:58.816 --> 36:59.616
fun metre fight now?

36:59.750 --> 37:00.817
Off the chart.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.586
You just had to make an

37:02.720 --> 37:03.386
adjustment.

37:03.521 --> 37:04.321
Yeah, yeah.

37:04.455 --> 37:05.822
Has anybody got a

37:05.957 --> 37:06.790
bigger smile than Becca,

37:06.924 --> 37:07.657
seriously?

37:07.792 --> 37:08.658
Five dollar.

37:08.793 --> 37:10.060
Five dollar?

37:10.194 --> 37:11.027
Okay, thank you.

37:11.162 --> 37:12.395
Yep, that's it.

37:12.530 --> 37:13.230
That's everything.

37:13.364 --> 37:14.364
There you go.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.700
From Brazil; It's worth more

37:16.834 --> 37:17.534
than you asked.

37:17.668 --> 37:18.668
Same exchange...

37:19.470 --> 37:20.470
It's $30 U.S., yep.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.140
Same thing.

37:24.275 --> 37:26.176
A box of matches.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.410
Thank you. Asante.

37:27.545 --> 37:28.612
Woo! Let's go!

37:28.746 --> 37:30.247
Come on, Sara!

37:30.381 --> 37:31.448
Let's go, Sara!

37:31.582 --> 37:34.217
Come on, Brooke!

37:34.352 --> 37:35.518
Get over here.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.421
My gosh.

37:38.556 --> 37:39.289
Hi, Phil!

37:39.423 --> 37:40.857
How are you doing?

37:40.992 --> 37:41.825
I'm tired.

37:41.959 --> 37:42.759
We did it.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.060
What a day?

37:44.195 --> 37:44.894
What a day!

37:45.029 --> 37:46.429
So am I good to go?

37:46.564 --> 37:47.397
No problem, no problem.

37:47.531 --> 37:48.398
Okay, alright, thank

37:48.532 --> 37:49.232
you.

37:49.367 --> 37:50.066
Let's go!

37:50.201 --> 37:51.334
Come on, come on.

37:55.139 --> 37:56.706
Thank you, thank you,

37:56.841 --> 37:57.540
thank you!

37:57.675 --> 37:58.675
Saeed!

37:59.343 --> 38:00.354
For free because we've got no

38:00.378 --> 38:01.077
dough left.

38:01.212 --> 38:01.911
Yeah.

38:02.046 --> 38:02.746
Thank god!

38:02.880 --> 38:03.580
You saved us.

38:03.714 --> 38:04.414
We were so nervous.

38:04.548 --> 38:05.548
If Olive comes out

38:05.583 --> 38:06.593
and they go through that market

38:06.617 --> 38:07.617
now, we're done.

38:08.286 --> 38:08.985
Watch out. Watch out,

38:09.120 --> 38:09.819
watch out, watch out.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.021
Thank you. Excuse me.

38:12.923 --> 38:14.324
Yes, you can change

38:14.458 --> 38:15.458
it. Yes, you can.

38:15.526 --> 38:16.693
Yes, right on the corner.

38:16.827 --> 38:18.028
We're three minutes behind.

38:18.162 --> 38:18.828
Shamir and Sara.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.230
We're going to try the running

38:20.364 --> 38:21.404
route rather than the taxi

38:21.532 --> 38:22.799
route, see if that'll get us

38:22.933 --> 38:23.633
there faster. Olive,

38:23.768 --> 38:24.601
let's go, let's go!

38:24.735 --> 38:26.269
That's all I have; That's all

38:26.404 --> 38:27.470
I have for you guys.

38:27.605 --> 38:28.438
You can change it right

38:28.572 --> 38:29.339
at the corner.

38:29.473 --> 38:30.540
Get the clue, get the

38:30.675 --> 38:31.675
clue, get the clue.

38:32.343 --> 38:33.043
I have no money.

38:33.177 --> 38:33.877
We can't take a cab.

38:34.011 --> 38:34.711
If we haven't settled

38:34.845 --> 38:35.545
it, we can't check in.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.823
I settled it. They know that

38:36.847 --> 38:37.547
it's Brazilian money. They're

38:37.682 --> 38:38.692
just asking if they can exchange

38:38.716 --> 38:39.716
it. I said, "Yes, I can"

38:39.750 --> 38:40.450
exchange it at the corner."

38:40.584 --> 38:41.595
It's okay? You can exchange.

38:41.619 --> 38:42.319
You can exchange it.

38:42.453 --> 38:43.186
You can exchange.

38:43.321 --> 38:43.987
Thank you.

38:44.121 --> 38:45.132
Thank you, thank you, thank

38:45.156 --> 38:45.889
you, thank you.

38:46.023 --> 38:47.290
It's faster to run, okay?

38:47.425 --> 38:48.491
Okay, that's what we

38:48.626 --> 38:49.292
have to do.

38:49.427 --> 38:50.126
Follow me.

38:50.261 --> 38:51.294
My god.

38:51.429 --> 38:52.506
Becca and Floyd, when you

38:52.530 --> 38:53.640
checked in, you thought you had

38:53.664 --> 38:54.431
your passports; Is that correct?

38:54.565 --> 38:55.265
Yes.

38:55.399 --> 38:56.166
You've discovered that

38:56.300 --> 38:57.500
you don't have your passports?

38:58.035 --> 38:59.235
I cannot check you in until

38:59.270 --> 38:59.969
you have your passports.

39:00.104 --> 39:00.804
Okay.

39:00.938 --> 39:02.115
So whatever you need to do,

39:02.139 --> 39:02.839
go do it.

39:02.973 --> 39:03.673
Okay.

39:03.808 --> 39:04.507
Okay. Thank you.

39:04.642 --> 39:05.642
We need to call him.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.145
You are an absolute

39:09.280 --> 39:11.047
idiot, dude. Zip your fanny

39:11.182 --> 39:13.350
pack. Are you kidding me?

39:13.484 --> 39:15.618
Let's call him, let's call him.

39:15.753 --> 39:17.253
So down that alley.

39:17.388 --> 39:18.588
We're going to go

39:18.723 --> 39:19.723
over there to the right?

39:19.824 --> 39:21.224
Okay. Let us out, let us out.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.058
Shamir, Shamir,

39:22.193 --> 39:22.926
I'm losing you.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.227
Come on, come on!

39:24.362 --> 39:25.795
Olive, are you with me?

39:25.930 --> 39:26.996
Stay ahead of me, Olive.

39:27.131 --> 39:27.797
There you go.

39:27.932 --> 39:29.142
Did anyone turn a passport in

39:29.166 --> 39:29.866
here?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.801
Emerson Hurumzi?

39:31.936 --> 39:32.802
This way?

39:32.937 --> 39:34.070
Thank you so much!

39:34.205 --> 39:35.205
Excuse me. Olive,

39:35.272 --> 39:36.005
stay up. Come on.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.507
My god, I'm going

39:37.641 --> 39:38.641
to have a heart attack.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.310
It's okay.

39:41.512 --> 39:42.679
That's right by the market.

39:42.813 --> 39:43.813
Come on!

39:43.881 --> 39:45.348
Let's go; Almost there!

39:45.483 --> 39:46.649
Sara, push, push.

39:46.784 --> 39:47.484
Come on!

39:47.618 --> 39:48.818
I'm coming!

39:48.953 --> 39:49.819
Abdul.

39:49.954 --> 39:51.187
No; Are you Abdul?

39:52.123 --> 39:54.524
Thank you, Abdul; Thank you!

39:58.662 --> 39:59.763
You with me?

39:59.897 --> 40:01.097
I'm with you.

40:02.066 --> 40:02.766
Hi.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.334
Hi there.

40:04.468 --> 40:05.301
Hello.

40:05.436 --> 40:06.302
I'm Zara.

40:06.437 --> 40:07.437
Welcome to Zanzibar.

40:07.538 --> 40:08.538
Thank you.

40:08.572 --> 40:09.773
Shamir and Sara,

40:09.907 --> 40:11.074
you're team number seven.

40:11.208 --> 40:12.208
Congratulations!

40:12.877 --> 40:14.511
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

40:14.645 --> 40:15.812
My god! What a day!

40:15.946 --> 40:17.280
It's been so much fun

40:17.415 --> 40:18.114
for me.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.582
Hold on a second... we've got

40:19.717 --> 40:20.417
another team.

40:20.551 --> 40:21.671
Come on under the mat, guys.

40:25.723 --> 40:27.023
Alright, Becca and Floyd,

40:27.158 --> 40:29.058
what would you like to tell me?

40:29.193 --> 40:31.461
I'd like to tell you that the

40:31.595 --> 40:33.229
passport is right here, so we

40:33.364 --> 40:34.063
found it.

40:34.198 --> 40:35.498
It's the first time that I

40:35.633 --> 40:36.966
have not seen a huge smile on

40:37.101 --> 40:38.111
your face. Where's the fun

40:38.135 --> 40:38.835
metre right now because...

40:38.969 --> 40:39.669
It's not high.

40:39.804 --> 40:40.503
I'm getting over it.

40:40.638 --> 40:42.205
I lost a lot of trust in that

40:42.339 --> 40:43.039
moment.

40:43.174 --> 40:44.541
I will be holding on to this

40:44.675 --> 40:45.375
from now on.

40:45.509 --> 40:46.553
You lose that passport, your

40:46.577 --> 40:47.277
race is over.

40:47.411 --> 40:48.111
Exactly.

40:48.245 --> 40:49.446
And he has a broken nose.

40:50.414 --> 40:51.881
And he has a broken nose.

41:04.428 --> 41:05.628
Seth and Olive, you are the

41:05.763 --> 41:07.964
last team to arrive, and

41:08.098 --> 41:09.365
unfortunately you have been

41:09.500 --> 41:10.667
eliminated from the race.

41:10.801 --> 41:13.069
U-Turn took you down.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.971
U-Turn, and we thought we may

41:15.105 --> 41:16.706
have a chance at the end, but...

41:16.841 --> 41:18.041
There's nothing we

41:18.175 --> 41:18.975
really I could have done.

41:19.109 --> 41:20.310
Ran as hard as we could.

41:20.444 --> 41:21.644
We made as many friends as we

41:21.779 --> 41:22.479
could.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.047
I wish that we were here to

41:24.181 --> 41:25.325
stay longer and could, you know,

41:25.349 --> 41:27.116
fight till the end, but at the

41:27.251 --> 41:28.751
end of the day it's a

41:28.886 --> 41:29.966
competition, and people are

41:30.020 --> 41:31.454
going to U-Turn you to benefit

41:31.589 --> 41:32.322
themselves.

41:32.456 --> 41:33.122
It's definitely disappointing,

41:33.257 --> 41:34.491
but it was still great.

41:34.625 --> 41:35.458
No regrets.

41:35.593 --> 41:36.726
This has been a great

41:36.861 --> 41:37.527
experience.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.362
I never had a moment where I

41:39.497 --> 41:40.597
regretted picking her as a

41:40.731 --> 41:42.565
partner.

41:59.783 --> 42:01.084
Stay tuned for scenes

42:01.218 --> 42:02.886
from our next episode.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.787
Next week on a two-hour

42:04.989 --> 42:06.166
episode of The Amazing Race...

42:06.190 --> 42:07.524
Hi, welcome to hell.

42:07.658 --> 42:08.858
Vanck and Ashton

42:08.993 --> 42:10.153
work on their communications.

42:10.261 --> 42:12.128
No. Vanck, please, come on.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.263
I don't want to keep

42:13.297 --> 42:13.963
on running.

42:14.098 --> 42:14.864
No. Okay, whenever we

42:14.999 --> 42:16.176
come in not first, this is why.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.066
And Brooke hits her

42:17.201 --> 42:18.201
breaking point.

42:18.235 --> 42:19.302
The problem is I am not

42:19.436 --> 42:20.870
strong enough and my jackass

42:21.005 --> 42:22.972
partner nominated me to do it.

42:23.107 --> 42:24.440
I'm trying, but I have no

42:24.575 --> 42:25.375
strength left.

42:25.509 --> 42:26.309
We're going to have to

42:26.443 --> 42:27.443
take a penalty.
