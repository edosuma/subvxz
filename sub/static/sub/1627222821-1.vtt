00:27.158 --> 00:29.928
<i>We have received
a request to visit Earth.</i>

00:29.961 --> 00:33.832
<i>Beware because Earth is not a
part of the galactic conglomerate.</i>

00:33.865 --> 00:36.101
<i>It can be a violent place</i>

00:36.134 --> 00:38.570
<i>or a place of many wonders.</i>

00:42.575 --> 00:45.345
<i>And it's not just
for anal probing anymore.</i>

00:47.880 --> 00:50.249
<i>Or maybe a reason
for the cows-loos.</i>

00:50.281 --> 00:51.650
<i>Beautiful,</i>

00:51.683 --> 00:52.951
<i>sexy,</i>

00:52.984 --> 00:54.353
<i>cow-loos.</i>

00:54.386 --> 00:56.089
<i>Whatever your purpose,</i>

00:56.121 --> 00:58.091
<i>you'll need to transform
your identity.</i>

00:58.124 --> 01:01.426
<i>The earthlings
are the scary and horrible.</i>

01:01.460 --> 01:03.396
<i>Stupid earthlings.</i>

01:03.429 --> 01:06.832
<i>You must choose a form
that is more familiar to them.</i>

01:06.865 --> 01:08.668
<i>Or your trip will not go well.</i>

01:08.700 --> 01:11.403
<i>Krep-Nu to you,
and travel well.</i>

02:03.155 --> 02:04.823
We're not... We're not
actually gonna go far with this.

02:04.856 --> 02:06.792
We're just gonna jump the fence,
we're gonna take our pictures.

02:06.825 --> 02:09.162
- <i>We're gonna GPS it, screenshot it, and we're...</i>
- <i>Wait.</i>

02:09.193 --> 02:10.395
We're not sneaking in.

02:10.429 --> 02:12.298
- Bro, we're sneaking in.
- No, we are sneaking in

02:12.330 --> 02:15.634
I know you didn't put on
tin-foil to not sneak in.

02:38.790 --> 02:41.661
<i>Bro, the guy who made the
Area 51 page is a pussy, bro.</i>

02:41.693 --> 02:44.963
I think they just changed it
last minute to a music festival.

02:44.997 --> 02:46.732
Guys, I think this is it.

02:46.764 --> 02:47.866
Oh, we're here.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.770
Oh, yo,
we're fuckin' here.

02:50.802 --> 02:52.437
What if I just drive through?

02:56.709 --> 02:59.045
Why are you driving
so fuckin' close, bro?

03:35.614 --> 03:38.317
- Wait. Is it if I step over there?
- No, hell no.

03:38.349 --> 03:41.419
- No, no, no, no.
- Yo, bro, get back in the car!

03:41.453 --> 03:44.824
One of the fuckin' alien is out!

03:44.856 --> 03:47.794
- That's gotta be a cow.
- Do you know where Area 50...

03:49.294 --> 03:51.363
Sir?

03:51.396 --> 03:52.897
I'm not the only one
seeing that, right?

03:52.931 --> 03:54.332
Do you fuckin' see
that shit, bro?

03:54.366 --> 03:55.668
What the fuck?

03:58.736 --> 04:00.305
Right there, bro. What is that?

04:00.338 --> 04:01.806
Someone's calling me...

04:01.840 --> 04:04.075
- I don't have any service.
- Does anyone have service?

04:04.109 --> 04:05.745
I left my phone in the...

04:32.904 --> 04:34.472
And so it begins.

04:34.505 --> 04:36.207
Area 51 weekend.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.512
Earnest here,
with Earnest's video log.

04:39.545 --> 04:42.348
Vlog. Vlog?

04:42.380 --> 04:44.483
It kinda sounds like crap,
doesn't it?

04:45.216 --> 04:46.551
What about...

04:47.185 --> 04:49.754
Earnest's video diary?

04:49.788 --> 04:51.591
Yeah, that's much better.

04:52.658 --> 04:54.093
I'm starting this vlog

04:54.125 --> 04:56.127
to document something major.

04:56.161 --> 04:59.798
This weekend, I'm going
to the Area 51 raid.

04:59.831 --> 05:04.002
Now, is it for the hopes of becoming
an alien fighting Will Smith?

05:04.036 --> 05:06.706
No, it's much more major
than that.

05:06.738 --> 05:08.540
And I'm not going alone.

05:08.574 --> 05:09.375
That's right.

05:09.408 --> 05:11.210
I'm going with Molly.

05:11.242 --> 05:13.646
And Jason. But Molly
is the important one.

05:14.913 --> 05:18.484
This weekend, I'm finally gonna
tell her how I feel.

05:18.516 --> 05:20.418
It's gonna be my moment
of man-up,

05:20.451 --> 05:23.154
be bold, and be honest.

05:23.187 --> 05:25.024
Oh, crap. There she is.

05:25.057 --> 05:27.492
Hey, Molly,
lemme get your luggage.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.216
How the hell did this happen?

06:24.081 --> 06:25.584
When the activist
knocked out our power,

06:25.617 --> 06:28.052
it killed the containment
system for a few seconds.

06:28.086 --> 06:29.655
Unfortunately, that was enough.

06:29.687 --> 06:31.790
How does some hippy,
tree-hugging activist

06:31.824 --> 06:34.360
knock out an entire mil spec
security system

06:34.392 --> 06:36.262
and power grid?

07:04.156 --> 07:06.091
These will come in handy.

07:07.692 --> 07:09.027
Over there.

07:09.060 --> 07:11.129
- What is it?
- Vault 237.

07:11.163 --> 07:12.631
The energy signature.

07:12.663 --> 07:13.733
It could be her.

07:14.266 --> 07:15.535
Watch my back.

07:24.810 --> 07:25.877
Freeze!

07:26.612 --> 07:27.580
Or what?

07:27.612 --> 07:30.048
This tranquilizer can put down
a baby elephant.

07:32.517 --> 07:33.852
So?

07:38.656 --> 07:40.725
Thanks for the hospitality.

07:52.971 --> 07:55.074
Whoo-wee!

07:55.107 --> 07:57.009
Look what the cat drug in.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.944
It's a pussy!

07:59.978 --> 08:01.614
A cat? Seriously?

08:01.646 --> 08:03.915
I don't know
what gave you that idea.

08:04.916 --> 08:06.084
You want some dick?

08:06.117 --> 08:07.719
Your name is "Dick?"

08:07.752 --> 08:09.921
No, it's Dave.

08:11.122 --> 08:12.457
Nice spandex.

08:12.490 --> 08:13.591
Okay, out of my way, Dave.

08:13.625 --> 08:14.994
I'm on a mission
to save the galaxy.

08:15.026 --> 08:17.997
- Ooh, that's hot.
- Oh, no, thanks.

08:23.869 --> 08:27.673
Sorry, I left my wallet in space.

08:34.346 --> 08:37.850
Ooh, all right, missy,
you're in for it.

08:37.883 --> 08:39.352
Kill 'em.

08:40.952 --> 08:42.254
I have two hands.

08:45.524 --> 08:47.725
This is only on
like four or five.

08:47.759 --> 08:49.495
It goes to 11.

08:53.432 --> 08:55.834
I'm dying.

08:57.635 --> 09:00.139
I need to
get that girl pregnant.

09:13.217 --> 09:15.820
Run.

09:18.056 --> 09:21.160
Bye-bye, Earth.
Thanks for the good times.

09:21.192 --> 09:23.062
Take me home.

09:40.879 --> 09:43.882
<i>I have detected
Sheera's energy signature.</i>

09:43.914 --> 09:45.750
It's about time.

09:45.783 --> 09:47.986
I'm coming for you, Sheera.

10:01.832 --> 10:03.434
Follow her.

10:03.467 --> 10:05.203
As you wish, Admiral Sklarr.

10:18.216 --> 10:20.418
I think I have something.

10:20.451 --> 10:22.287
Where is this?

10:22.320 --> 10:24.724
Northern perimeter. Sector D-3.

10:25.890 --> 10:27.192
Bingo.

10:28.527 --> 10:29.595
Hey, everybody.

10:29.628 --> 10:30.863
Mark your calendars.

10:30.895 --> 10:32.130
'Cause it has finally happened.

10:32.163 --> 10:35.833
Everything I predicted
has finally come true.

10:35.866 --> 10:38.370
When I was a kid,
growing up in Nevada,

10:38.403 --> 10:41.240
my mom was married
to an asshole...

10:41.273 --> 10:43.676
A supposed "scientist"

10:43.708 --> 10:46.144
abducted me.
He took me to what I know

10:46.177 --> 10:48.279
was Area 51

10:48.312 --> 10:50.048
where they put me in a lab,

10:50.081 --> 10:51.450
strapped me to a table,

10:51.482 --> 10:53.251
drugged me,

10:53.284 --> 10:55.353
and implanted a chip
in my brain.

10:55.386 --> 10:56.554
This is Curly G.

10:56.587 --> 10:58.589
And this is the <i>Curly G Show.</i>

10:58.623 --> 11:00.192
Today's show isn't about comedy.

11:00.225 --> 11:02.561
It's not about who my family is.

11:02.594 --> 11:05.397
There's something personal
going on here.

11:05.429 --> 11:08.066
There's aliens.
They're coming for me!

11:08.100 --> 11:09.268
Why?

11:09.301 --> 11:11.403
Because I have
royal blood, okay?

11:11.436 --> 11:13.471
I... I don't know.
Is it my DNA they want?

11:13.504 --> 11:16.174
Is it my loved man juice?
I don't really know.

11:16.207 --> 11:17.241
Oh, yeah!

11:17.274 --> 11:18.810
I'm going to Area 51.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.646
And I'm wearing a backpack,

11:20.678 --> 11:22.146
and I'm wearing a vest.

11:22.179 --> 11:24.315
Aliens are real!

11:24.349 --> 11:26.518
We're not the only ones here!

11:26.551 --> 11:28.487
Get it through your heads!

11:28.519 --> 11:30.456
Curly G warned you.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.158
Curly G out.

11:33.557 --> 11:35.793
Aliens are real.

11:35.826 --> 11:39.664
I don't know how many more
of these videos I have to do...

11:39.697 --> 11:42.735
to get the word out there
and let everybody know

11:43.368 --> 11:44.670
what's true.

11:44.702 --> 11:47.472
I got this shirt from an
alien tour a few years ago

11:47.505 --> 11:49.640
where I got to meet
the interloper,

11:49.673 --> 11:51.610
the Alien Warrior Comedian.

11:51.643 --> 11:53.612
They're in different forms.

11:54.578 --> 11:56.815
I understand some are cats.

11:57.682 --> 11:58.984
And I...

11:59.017 --> 12:01.620
I think it's trying
to assimilate me.

12:01.653 --> 12:03.654
Oh, God.

12:03.687 --> 12:06.225
If I was to look directly at it,

12:06.258 --> 12:08.026
it would start to assimilate...

12:08.058 --> 12:09.694
my body.

12:09.727 --> 12:11.763
I don't have a cat.

12:11.797 --> 12:14.166
All of a sudden out from behind
the hills

12:14.198 --> 12:17.301
came a big lion, just rising up.

12:17.335 --> 12:18.870
And I said
what the hell is that?

12:18.903 --> 12:20.773
Old Billy Bob,
he got a little bit afraid

12:20.806 --> 12:24.777
seeing that happen, one of them there tractor
beams came shooting out of that ship.

12:24.809 --> 12:26.644
And they took Old Billy Bob.

12:26.677 --> 12:28.514
So, you come back
to your old buddy

12:28.547 --> 12:29.782
and you beware

12:29.815 --> 12:31.416
and we're gonna keep reporting

12:31.448 --> 12:32.884
every sighting of the big E

12:32.918 --> 12:35.520
And, now, we gotta
look for them grays

12:35.553 --> 12:37.923
and all them other alien types.

12:37.956 --> 12:40.325
And I'll keep reporting
the news to you.

12:40.357 --> 12:41.626
You take care!

12:44.629 --> 12:48.134
Worst... raid... ever.

12:48.799 --> 12:50.701
I can't believe we failed.

12:50.735 --> 12:52.870
Well, of course, we failed.

12:52.903 --> 12:55.173
How are we going to beat
the government?

12:55.206 --> 12:58.076
Mol, the rest of the crowd
took us a little more seriously

12:58.109 --> 13:01.346
as opposed to treating it like some
sort of off-season birding, man,

13:01.379 --> 13:03.048
then maybe this would've worked.

13:03.081 --> 13:05.250
Would you like to go back
and try again?

13:05.283 --> 13:07.619
Are you serious, Molly?

13:07.652 --> 13:09.754
- Jason?
- Earnest.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.224
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea!

13:12.256 --> 13:14.959
Maybe this time
we can actually get arrested.

13:14.993 --> 13:19.064
Ooh! Or get an anal probe if
they're partnering with the aliens.

13:20.197 --> 13:22.934
- Are you into that?
- What's so funny?

13:24.668 --> 13:26.004
Aliens?

13:26.037 --> 13:28.540
I mean, come on,
there's no such thing as aliens.

13:28.572 --> 13:30.107
Not true.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.910
Statistically speaking,
there should be about...

13:32.943 --> 13:34.913
I think 3,000 intelligent races

13:34.946 --> 13:36.514
within in a 30-year flight plan.

13:36.548 --> 13:38.283
Yeah, but those are just stats.

13:38.316 --> 13:40.319
I mean... Where's the proof?

13:41.385 --> 13:43.288
Thirty years in the spaceship?

13:43.788 --> 13:45.224
No, thank you.

13:45.256 --> 13:46.691
They can come to us.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.894
Is it too early
to start drinking?

14:02.440 --> 14:05.310
Commander.
Are you there, Sheera?

14:05.342 --> 14:06.711
Yes, Kyra.

14:06.745 --> 14:07.980
Did you retreat the device?

14:08.013 --> 14:09.748
What do you think?

14:09.780 --> 14:12.116
Preparing extraction plan now.

14:19.524 --> 14:20.759
Oh, no.

14:20.792 --> 14:22.127
What is it?

14:22.159 --> 14:23.261
They followed me.

14:23.294 --> 14:24.596
Sklarr?

14:24.629 --> 14:26.697
I think so.

14:26.730 --> 14:28.500
It's charging
some kind of device.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.034
The energy signature...

14:33.038 --> 14:34.273
Kyra?

14:36.274 --> 14:37.408
Kyra, are you there?

14:42.313 --> 14:45.884
I think that was
a person... once.

14:45.917 --> 14:48.153
What a horrible way to die!

14:48.820 --> 14:50.855
I wish we had that filmed.

14:51.822 --> 14:54.425
For scientific purposes,
of course.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.960
Of course.

14:56.827 --> 14:58.362
Do you think she did it?

14:58.395 --> 15:00.966
Can you think of anything else
that would do that?

15:02.267 --> 15:05.037
Not unless something else
escaped from our lab.

15:08.605 --> 15:09.942
Let's go.

15:19.650 --> 15:20.885
What was that?

15:20.918 --> 15:22.853
I... I don't know.
A meteor, maybe?

15:22.886 --> 15:25.456
Oh, come on. That seems
a little coincidental.

15:26.524 --> 15:28.059
It's pretty close, though.

15:28.659 --> 15:30.094
Let's go check it out.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.068
Make it night.

15:37.101 --> 15:37.903
Day.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.538
- Night.
- Day.

15:39.571 --> 15:40.772
- Night.
- Day.

15:40.804 --> 15:42.340
You still got it.

15:56.653 --> 15:58.456
I think it's this way.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.491
I hope
there's some of the meteor left.

16:00.524 --> 16:01.793
You think
we could sell it?

16:01.826 --> 16:03.829
Or collect it.
I don't have one of those.

16:03.861 --> 16:06.163
Screw that.
I could just use the cash.

16:06.197 --> 16:08.933
- For what?
- Replica collectibles.

16:08.966 --> 16:10.936
Not worthless rocks.

16:17.408 --> 16:18.509
Molly.

16:20.577 --> 16:22.213
Wow.

16:22.246 --> 16:26.350
Uh, it's okay.
We're not gonna hurt you.

16:26.384 --> 16:28.754
Yeah, we're harmless.

16:28.787 --> 16:30.155
Do I look worried?

16:30.889 --> 16:32.090
Where am I?

16:32.123 --> 16:34.259
Just outside of Groom Lake.

16:34.859 --> 16:36.628
I need the coordinates.

16:36.660 --> 16:42.066
Uh, -115.798936

16:42.767 --> 16:47.706
by 37.276675.

16:47.739 --> 16:49.341
How do you know that?

16:50.774 --> 16:52.010
Of course.

16:53.977 --> 16:55.346
Okay, thank you.

16:57.849 --> 16:59.384
Oh, no.

16:59.417 --> 17:01.787
I'm on a mission

17:01.820 --> 17:04.923
to save the galaxy.

17:12.363 --> 17:13.932
I think she has a pulse.

17:13.964 --> 17:16.300
Hey, maybe she needs
mouth-to-mouth.

17:16.334 --> 17:17.469
No.

17:17.501 --> 17:18.935
Perv.

17:20.771 --> 17:23.307
Okay, maybe you're right.

17:29.747 --> 17:32.250
No means no.

17:33.585 --> 17:34.920
Whoa.

17:34.952 --> 17:37.321
She really can
take care of herself.

17:37.355 --> 17:39.658
Come on. Let's see
if we can move her.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.327
We can't just leave her here.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.297
I've got a bad back.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.066
Seriously?

17:49.433 --> 17:52.471
Ugh, fine, I'll try.

18:57.568 --> 18:59.270
Oh!

19:00.672 --> 19:03.575
What kind of ritual is this?

19:08.313 --> 19:14.086
Ah, I think I should
investigate further.

19:31.435 --> 19:32.471
Hello.

19:33.304 --> 19:34.172
Hi.

19:34.204 --> 19:36.008
What's your costume?

19:36.941 --> 19:38.309
Costume?

19:38.343 --> 19:40.479
Ooh, a method actor?

20:06.871 --> 20:08.640
Oh.

20:26.290 --> 20:28.960
Well, she doesn't look like
she's from around here.

20:28.992 --> 20:31.663
Nah. And I've definitely
never seen an outfit

20:31.695 --> 20:33.163
like that before.

20:33.196 --> 20:35.600
What the fudge
happened to the sky?

20:55.920 --> 21:00.292
So her last words were
"Mission to save the galaxy."

21:01.291 --> 21:03.661
What if she's not from Earth?

21:03.694 --> 21:07.631
So we just made first contact
with an alien lifeform?

21:07.664 --> 21:10.368
I mean, that's why we're here,
isn't it?

21:11.368 --> 21:13.804
I think whoever tried to get in,
something or...

21:13.837 --> 21:15.874
someone got out.

21:15.906 --> 21:17.274
Maybe we could sell her.

21:17.307 --> 21:18.643
Sell her back to the government.

21:18.675 --> 21:19.977
Maybe there's a reward.

21:20.010 --> 21:22.079
Ah, no.

21:22.113 --> 21:24.249
That is definitely
human trafficking.

21:24.281 --> 21:27.018
Oh, yeah, but, by the way,
you put it

21:27.050 --> 21:29.855
- she's not even a human.
- Oh!

21:36.794 --> 21:40.699
The bottom line is,
what do we do with her?

21:40.731 --> 21:43.167
I say we leave her here
and head home.

21:44.434 --> 21:46.471
I say I take her home with me.

21:46.503 --> 21:48.572
I'm sure my mom
would be cool with it.

21:50.007 --> 21:52.009
You guys can do
whatever you want.

21:52.042 --> 21:54.111
But I'm not leaving here or her

21:54.144 --> 21:56.480
until I know exactly
who or what she is.

22:11.429 --> 22:12.831
Mmm.

22:13.998 --> 22:16.534
That was my lunch.

22:16.567 --> 22:22.207
Oh, this is good. Are there more?
Can we get more? They're so yummy.

22:23.039 --> 22:24.442
What happened to our daylight?

22:24.474 --> 22:26.810
It's three in the afternoon,
and it's dark.

22:26.844 --> 22:28.546
Mmm. No, that's Sklarr.

22:28.578 --> 22:30.280
He controls the day
and the night.

22:30.314 --> 22:31.983
He can turn day into night,
night into day.

22:32.016 --> 22:33.884
Night into night.
Can I get more cake?

22:37.154 --> 22:39.691
Mmm.

22:48.865 --> 22:50.301
What the...

22:52.236 --> 22:56.475
What do you call this?
It... feels so good.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.710
It's called dancing.

23:00.478 --> 23:01.513
Mmm.

23:02.012 --> 23:04.182
Oh, it feels like

23:04.214 --> 23:08.352
I'm in a maiden pod...
Or seed collection.

23:10.855 --> 23:12.557
Are you a virgin?

23:12.589 --> 23:13.858
What's a virgin?

23:16.693 --> 23:19.964
No. No. No.

23:21.132 --> 23:23.602
No. No. No.

23:24.101 --> 23:26.371
Yes. Yes.

23:26.938 --> 23:28.840
Yes. No, no.

23:29.707 --> 23:31.342
No.

23:31.375 --> 23:34.546
You have made me harvest my seed
without permission.

23:35.212 --> 23:37.315
It's a crime in my world.

23:37.347 --> 23:40.617
Well, we're not
on your world, are we?

23:43.186 --> 23:46.557
Uh, no. No, no. We're not.
As if...

23:47.357 --> 23:51.729
If this is your... Oh, my God.

23:51.761 --> 23:55.066
This is a custom I suppose
I should learn

23:55.098 --> 23:58.369
if I'm to conquer your world.

24:02.472 --> 24:04.241
Does that include spanking?

24:06.844 --> 24:12.217
So, how many times in a night
can you harvest your seed?

24:12.250 --> 24:15.553
Oh, well, my personal best
is 206.

24:15.586 --> 24:18.088
I'm not trying to beat
your personal best.

24:18.122 --> 24:20.025
- Okay.
- Hey!

24:21.858 --> 24:23.961
Where do you think
you're going with my girlfriend?

24:23.994 --> 24:25.529
All because I gave you
a handjob

24:25.563 --> 24:28.700
doesn't mean
I'm your girlfriend, Jerry.

24:28.732 --> 24:31.435
Well, you're picking a really bad
time to break up with me, then.

24:32.869 --> 24:34.838
What are you, some kind of
wannabe Darth Vader?

24:34.872 --> 24:36.908
It's not even a good
Darth Vader costume.

24:36.941 --> 24:40.310
I mean, did your mommy buy an
off-brand one from Big Lots?

24:40.344 --> 24:41.946
Good one.

24:41.979 --> 24:44.850
Seriously, dude. You're not
leaving this party with my girl.

24:45.415 --> 24:46.851
Or her friend.

24:48.719 --> 24:50.020
So,

24:50.054 --> 24:52.223
what happens now?
Do I shoot first

24:52.256 --> 24:54.425
or do one of you have the guts

24:54.458 --> 24:56.261
to make the first move?

24:56.294 --> 24:58.229
Do I look scared to you,
Big Lots blaster?

24:58.261 --> 25:00.798
- You did that joke already.
- It's a callback.

25:03.467 --> 25:04.669
Cool ray gun.

25:10.273 --> 25:11.408
Is he dead?

25:11.442 --> 25:15.579
Oh, no, no. It's set to stun.

25:15.613 --> 25:19.217
Look, maybe we got off
to a bad start here,

25:19.250 --> 25:22.819
I'm, uh, not looking
for a confrontation.

25:22.853 --> 25:26.291
I'm simply trying to find
my travelling companion.

25:26.324 --> 25:28.093
Maybe you could help me
find her.

25:29.359 --> 25:30.527
"Her?"

25:30.560 --> 25:32.596
What the actual fucker.
Are you married?

25:32.630 --> 25:35.000
No, it's not like that.

25:35.967 --> 25:37.602
It's not like that at all.

25:37.634 --> 25:40.838
I'm hunting her. Like an animal.

25:44.141 --> 25:46.844
I hate these misogynist freaks.

25:46.876 --> 25:48.645
Let's get 'em.

25:48.679 --> 25:50.749
Run!

26:04.362 --> 26:05.663
What are you doing?

26:05.695 --> 26:07.531
I'm shooting for the Gram.

26:07.565 --> 26:09.500
You'll probably go viral.

26:10.401 --> 26:12.737
I'm... I'm kind of like
an influencer.

26:13.304 --> 26:14.405
What's your hashtag?

26:14.438 --> 26:16.975
I've won 360,000 followers.

26:18.409 --> 26:20.145
I usually charge for this.

26:21.479 --> 26:23.715
This Gram thing cannot be good.

26:25.281 --> 26:27.519
I have to rethink my plan.

26:32.856 --> 26:33.791
Text me.

26:35.393 --> 26:36.594
He was cute.

26:43.401 --> 26:46.104
Hello, I'm Sklarr.

26:46.136 --> 26:49.906
<i>You may know me from my many
interstellar accomplishments,</i>

26:49.940 --> 26:53.411
such as the Ram Blood
Colony Extinctions.

26:53.443 --> 26:55.012
<i>I don't like to brag,</i>

26:55.046 --> 27:00.718
but I do have over 6,000
anal probings to my credit,

27:00.750 --> 27:05.256
that is 6,000 anal probings
that I performed on other...

27:05.288 --> 27:08.326
I've never actually been probed.

27:08.358 --> 27:11.228
Just wanna get... clear that up.

27:11.261 --> 27:14.264
<i>My idea of a perfect date? Hmm.</i>

27:14.298 --> 27:17.234
Well, I do like to pack
a travel pod

27:17.268 --> 27:19.903
with a Koondorp offspring

27:19.936 --> 27:23.173
and whisk off to the lava storms
of Me Clan

27:23.207 --> 27:25.476
to listen to the mind screams.

27:25.509 --> 27:29.480
Or perhaps a day trip to
the Roomrod asteroid belt

27:29.512 --> 27:31.816
for some radiation burns.

27:31.848 --> 27:34.818
A lot of my friends
are content to just stay home

27:34.852 --> 27:38.089
and cover themselves
in borp feces

27:38.122 --> 27:40.191
and watch the dust clouds.

27:41.325 --> 27:42.259
Not me.

27:43.059 --> 27:44.895
I like to get up

27:45.895 --> 27:46.964
and enjoy life.

27:47.932 --> 27:50.101
No more mating pods
for this guy.

27:50.134 --> 27:53.171
I'm just looking for that
special someone

27:53.203 --> 27:56.039
<i>to enjoy life with,</i>

27:56.073 --> 27:57.809
<i>and have adventures</i>

27:57.842 --> 28:01.646
and eventually, to do the...
To do the dancing.

28:03.180 --> 28:04.816
I really like dancing.

28:08.051 --> 28:09.219
Come find me.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.692
I don't think he's from
around here.

29:21.724 --> 29:22.759
Really, Henry?

29:22.792 --> 29:23.827
Which one of your degrees
did you use

29:23.861 --> 29:25.696
to come to that conclusion?

29:25.729 --> 29:27.932
Obviously, he's a new player.

29:28.531 --> 29:30.201
I recognize that clearing.

29:30.233 --> 29:31.234
Let's head west.

29:31.268 --> 29:33.538
Grab the electromagnetic scanner
from the truck.

29:33.570 --> 29:35.339
It's underneath the furry
unicorn costume.

29:40.144 --> 29:43.381
I'm from another planet,
another universe, in fact.

29:43.413 --> 29:45.249
My species has found
that simplicity

29:45.281 --> 29:47.117
is the safest way to live.

29:47.151 --> 29:49.353
Right on. Peace and love.

29:49.385 --> 29:50.354
Yes, that's us.

29:50.386 --> 29:51.855
We are a peaceful race.

29:51.888 --> 29:54.291
But when pushed,
we can defend ourselves.

29:54.325 --> 29:56.326
- Yeah.
- Noted.

29:56.359 --> 29:58.962
And we work with our planet
instead of against it.

29:58.996 --> 30:01.499
Symbiosis between the two
has provided us

30:01.531 --> 30:04.801
with great prosperity
and unmatched power.

30:04.835 --> 30:07.971
The planet itself has come up
with a way to keep out invaders.

30:08.372 --> 30:10.041
How?

30:10.074 --> 30:13.443
It's a natural biological agent
that causes them to become ill,

30:13.477 --> 30:15.780
even with their protective
bio suits.

30:15.813 --> 30:18.516
And it makes
their weapons unusable.

30:18.548 --> 30:19.817
How does that work?

30:19.849 --> 30:21.151
We haven't been able
to figure that out,

30:21.184 --> 30:24.120
but we have been able to
harness it and use it off world.

30:24.153 --> 30:25.289
So how did you get here?

30:25.756 --> 30:26.891
I had a spaceship,

30:26.923 --> 30:28.392
but it was destroyed in a crash.

30:28.424 --> 30:30.493
And I was captured
by your military.

30:30.527 --> 30:32.462
Recently, when there was
a loss of power,

30:32.496 --> 30:33.698
I managed to escape.

30:33.730 --> 30:34.999
I may have done that.

30:36.099 --> 30:37.434
Excuse me?

30:37.468 --> 30:38.836
I think you were being held

30:38.868 --> 30:41.805
in a research lab
called Area 51.

30:41.838 --> 30:45.909
We think that they're holding
a lot of extra-terrestrials.

30:46.676 --> 30:47.878
They are.

30:48.979 --> 30:49.913
Right on.

30:50.647 --> 30:51.982
Who's chasing you?

30:52.516 --> 30:53.451
Chasing me?

30:54.151 --> 30:55.820
When you crashed...

30:55.853 --> 30:58.423
or did you just forget how to
drive your ship?

30:59.556 --> 31:01.292
I did not forget
how to drive my ship.

31:01.791 --> 31:03.461
His name is Sklarr.

31:03.493 --> 31:04.694
Who's Sklarr?

31:04.728 --> 31:06.497
The bad guy, obviously.

31:06.529 --> 31:08.598
He's part of
the Andovian Empire.

31:08.632 --> 31:10.701
They control most
of our planetary system,

31:10.733 --> 31:14.271
but not my planet... yet.

31:14.305 --> 31:15.873
Well, better get comfortable

31:15.905 --> 31:18.442
'cause you don't have a ship.

31:20.611 --> 31:21.913
I have this.

31:28.384 --> 31:31.055
360,000 followers?

31:32.256 --> 31:33.458
It's impossible.

31:36.693 --> 31:37.961
I'm going to kill her.

31:38.996 --> 31:41.900
I will show her an influencer.

31:42.833 --> 31:44.402
Damn it, where's my weapon?

31:47.637 --> 31:48.906
I'll use my axe.

31:49.906 --> 31:52.842
This is a bio info pod.

31:52.875 --> 31:55.913
I retrieved it from
your Area 51.

31:55.945 --> 31:58.281
That was the real purpose
of my mission.

31:58.315 --> 32:01.052
They recovered it from
a previous crash here on Earth.

32:01.652 --> 32:03.921
- Roswell?
- That's the one.

32:03.953 --> 32:05.889
It contains plans
to Sklarr's ship,

32:05.923 --> 32:08.326
a map of my
home planet's defenses,

32:08.358 --> 32:13.196
60,000 songs and 25,000 videos
you call movies.

32:13.663 --> 32:14.932
It's an iPod.

32:15.898 --> 32:18.668
No, it's a bio info pod.

32:18.701 --> 32:20.770
Can your iPod do this?

32:39.455 --> 32:42.125
Apart from him,
there are four other officers.

32:44.361 --> 32:45.229
Hey, wait up.

32:49.799 --> 32:51.201
What is that?

32:51.234 --> 32:52.235
Bad guy's gun.

32:57.273 --> 32:58.275
Patrick?

33:04.981 --> 33:07.151
- And that's what I'm up against.
- Hm.

33:08.251 --> 33:10.553
Why does this guy Sklarr
hate you so much?

33:10.586 --> 33:12.088
He has a score to settle.

33:12.122 --> 33:14.191
I wounded him
and he never forgot it.

33:14.223 --> 33:16.426
His plan is to take me back
to his home planet

33:16.460 --> 33:18.962
and have me publicly
executed as an example.

33:18.996 --> 33:21.265
Sounds like a pretty
dangerous man.

33:21.298 --> 33:22.199
He's not a man.

33:22.231 --> 33:24.568
He's part humanoid
and part nanotechnology.

33:25.803 --> 33:27.605
I wounded him last time.

33:27.637 --> 33:29.472
I can kill him this time.

33:29.506 --> 33:31.009
Can he invade our planet?

33:32.009 --> 33:33.443
He probably doesn't have
the troops

33:33.477 --> 33:34.979
or the firepower with him.

33:36.413 --> 33:37.414
Probably?

33:39.715 --> 33:42.385
He does have
the Starburst weapon.

33:42.419 --> 33:45.389
And what is the Starburst
weapon?

33:45.422 --> 33:48.159
It's a weapon capable
of emitting a radioactive burst

33:48.192 --> 33:50.294
that can destroy
all life on a planet.

33:50.693 --> 33:51.828
Right.

33:51.862 --> 33:52.897
That doesn't sound too good.

33:52.930 --> 33:54.832
No, and after
they kill everyone,

33:54.865 --> 33:56.733
they strip the planet
of its resources

33:56.767 --> 33:58.068
and anybody who's left alive,

33:58.102 --> 34:00.237
is turned into a slave
or used for breeding.

34:00.269 --> 34:03.641
Well, I guess
that's something.

34:04.474 --> 34:06.176
No, no, in my world,

34:06.210 --> 34:08.045
sex for pleasure
is a thing of the past.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.148
The breeding pods
give very little pleasure

34:11.181 --> 34:13.150
and are only used on slaves.

34:14.818 --> 34:19.056
- Oh.
- So, you've never had sex?

34:20.456 --> 34:22.292
No, I haven't.

34:23.126 --> 34:26.197
Well, what a coincidence!

34:26.230 --> 34:28.666
We have so much in common.

34:32.235 --> 34:35.440
Sklarr!

34:37.106 --> 34:38.309
Leave as soon as you can.

34:38.342 --> 34:40.411
He will capture or kill you
if he finds you,

34:40.443 --> 34:42.246
especially since
you were helping me.

34:43.547 --> 34:44.648
I'll track him.

34:44.681 --> 34:46.951
I knew this was a bad idea.

34:46.983 --> 34:48.052
What are you doing?

34:48.085 --> 34:49.853
I'm getting the hell
out of here.

34:49.887 --> 34:51.722
We can't just leave her.

34:51.755 --> 34:52.690
Well, watch me.

34:53.789 --> 34:55.927
Oh, so you're running too?

34:57.594 --> 34:58.762
We're out of our league here.

34:58.795 --> 35:01.798
I... I mean, this is between her
and the ones up there.

35:01.831 --> 35:03.134
- No.
- The bad ones.

35:03.166 --> 35:05.369
The ones up there
can destroy us.

35:05.402 --> 35:06.237
You heard her.

35:06.269 --> 35:08.371
Molly, we don't know
if that's true.

35:09.373 --> 35:11.976
Okay. So how do you
explain that?

35:12.009 --> 35:13.543
Static electricity?

35:14.610 --> 35:15.980
I'm not going anywhere.

35:17.681 --> 35:19.750
It's always the women
who are willing to sacrifice

35:19.782 --> 35:20.717
for the good of all.

35:21.351 --> 35:22.920
Hey!

35:22.952 --> 35:24.355
They're really trying
their best.

35:24.387 --> 35:26.891
- Thank you.
- That wasn't a compliment.

35:26.923 --> 35:27.992
We could use more weapons

35:28.025 --> 35:30.860
and possibly
an interstellar comm unit.

35:30.893 --> 35:33.096
Okay, I have no idea
how to do that,

35:33.130 --> 35:35.266
but, at least
I'm willing to try.

35:38.235 --> 35:42.039
So, are you in or out?

35:43.840 --> 35:46.242
Fine, I'll go.

35:47.811 --> 35:48.713
What?

35:50.280 --> 35:51.649
Uh, fine.

35:53.050 --> 35:55.786
I'll go.

35:55.818 --> 35:58.556
This is the last time I'm gonna
listen to the both of you.

36:01.592 --> 36:04.162
I'll work on that.

36:04.827 --> 36:06.998
I've got him.

36:11.367 --> 36:13.536
Hello, Sklarr. Are you okay?

36:13.570 --> 36:20.010
I was in battle with a...
129 earthlings.

36:20.043 --> 36:21.311
They rushed me,

36:22.012 --> 36:23.647
and did get my weapon,

36:23.679 --> 36:27.817
but in the end,
I emerged victorious, of course.

36:27.851 --> 36:29.452
Do you need additional troops?

36:29.485 --> 36:30.721
<i>Uh, no, no.</i>

36:30.753 --> 36:33.123
<i>Uh, just another dissolver.</i>

36:33.155 --> 36:34.592
The battle's almost won.

36:35.224 --> 36:37.027
Once we find Sheera

36:37.059 --> 36:39.730
and the stolen plans,
we can return home.

36:42.164 --> 36:45.302
Oh, I am feeling
a little peckish.

36:45.335 --> 36:47.204
Send a snack, will you?

36:47.804 --> 36:48.739
Yes, Admiral.

36:55.244 --> 36:56.112
Oh.

37:06.623 --> 37:07.557
Mm.

37:09.925 --> 37:11.228
Mm.

37:23.005 --> 37:24.240
I've got a lock.

37:24.273 --> 37:26.543
The source of that noise
is about a mile behind us.

37:29.146 --> 37:30.681
Should we call for backup?

37:31.181 --> 37:32.717
Not this time.

37:43.126 --> 37:45.763
Jerry, the dweeb loser.
Where's your girlfriend?

37:48.065 --> 37:49.767
Oh, you...
You have a ray gun now?

37:51.134 --> 37:52.402
It's not a toy, Bryce.

37:54.538 --> 37:56.873
You're the same loser you were
in high school.

38:34.143 --> 38:35.878
School is out forever.

38:47.757 --> 38:49.359
NPC Clone number three.

38:49.393 --> 38:50.927
Prepare the interrogation.

38:56.233 --> 38:58.302
Help, help!

38:58.335 --> 39:00.037
That was a lot of screams.

39:00.070 --> 39:01.505
The festival?

39:01.538 --> 39:03.139
Well, that doesn't make sense.
Why would Sklarr attack a party,

39:03.172 --> 39:04.474
especially if I'm not there?

39:04.507 --> 39:05.842
But what if it's not Sklarr?

39:06.976 --> 39:08.010
Let's check it out.

39:25.728 --> 39:26.829
Yes, Admiral?

39:26.862 --> 39:29.198
Did you launch an attack?
I hear dissolvers.

39:29.231 --> 39:30.967
We're not attacking, Admiral.

39:32.335 --> 39:34.405
Scan the area.
Send me the results.

39:37.974 --> 39:39.309
Stop.

39:40.710 --> 39:42.713
This is great. I could
kill everyone with this.

39:43.213 --> 39:44.582
Give me that.

39:45.114 --> 39:46.282
Idiot!

39:46.782 --> 39:48.018
I'm here for Sheera.

39:48.050 --> 39:50.586
You puny Earthlings
are irrelevant.

39:50.619 --> 39:52.355
What'd she do?

39:52.389 --> 39:54.291
Don't bother me
with your questions.

39:55.358 --> 39:56.760
Take me with you.

39:58.494 --> 39:59.362
Where?

39:59.829 --> 40:00.898
To your planet.

40:01.697 --> 40:02.465
Why?

40:02.498 --> 40:04.467
Because I hate it here.

40:04.501 --> 40:08.138
I could be of use to you,
tell you all about Earth.

40:08.170 --> 40:11.975
You would help us
to conquer your own planet?

40:13.143 --> 40:14.378
Yes.

40:14.411 --> 40:16.313
How well do you know this land?

40:16.980 --> 40:17.981
I know it.

40:21.818 --> 40:22.887
I see.

40:23.552 --> 40:25.822
Well, then hang on to this.

40:26.623 --> 40:27.691
You may need it.

40:29.291 --> 40:30.994
This is for stealing it.

40:41.304 --> 40:42.806
You may go.

40:42.838 --> 40:43.873
But Vice Admiral,

40:43.907 --> 40:45.809
the Admiral told me
to stay with the prisoner.

40:45.842 --> 40:48.612
I'm the ranking officer
on this ship.

40:48.644 --> 40:51.380
You may go.

40:51.414 --> 40:53.016
I don't want there
to be any witnesses

40:53.048 --> 40:54.351
to what I'm about to do.

40:55.751 --> 40:56.786
Yes, sir.

41:03.059 --> 41:05.496
It's okay.
I'm here to rescue you.

41:05.528 --> 41:07.864
- What?
- Sheera's father Klak-Nu

41:07.898 --> 41:10.834
saved my father's life
at the battle of Greep-Nur.

41:10.867 --> 41:12.202
I'm repaying a debt.

41:12.235 --> 41:13.303
Where is Sheera?

41:13.335 --> 41:14.604
She's alive and on Earth.

41:14.637 --> 41:16.405
Sklarr is there as well,
attracting her.

41:16.438 --> 41:17.740
We need to help her.

41:17.773 --> 41:20.443
And we'll do that
by taking control of the ship.

41:20.476 --> 41:22.913
There are three other guards
besides me.

41:22.945 --> 41:24.681
- Get me a weapon.
- In time.

41:24.713 --> 41:28.052
But first, we need to fake
a chemical interrogation.

41:28.717 --> 41:29.853
Trust me.

41:42.831 --> 41:45.469
Looks like someone gave up
on the party.

41:45.501 --> 41:48.005
Oh, just take what you can
that's not damaged.

41:52.375 --> 41:54.411
Some of this looks like
it's worth money.

41:55.277 --> 41:56.546
What's money?

41:57.280 --> 41:59.283
It's stuff you use to buy stuff.

42:05.454 --> 42:07.056
Take what you can
and let's leave.

42:09.291 --> 42:10.627
Done. Go.

42:15.731 --> 42:16.833
She's been here.

42:18.802 --> 42:20.403
And she's wounded.

42:20.436 --> 42:21.871
How can you tell that?

42:24.273 --> 42:25.976
You have low blood sugar.

42:27.978 --> 42:30.079
And a low sperm count.

42:30.112 --> 42:31.347
Okay, I get it.

42:31.380 --> 42:33.416
Where would they be
hiding around here?

42:34.516 --> 42:36.052
There's a cabin up this way.

42:53.570 --> 42:56.807
Wait. We need that door knob.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.742
Earnest, do you still
have the lock picks?

43:03.980 --> 43:05.182
All right.

43:08.385 --> 43:09.720
<i>Voila!</i>

43:23.565 --> 43:25.534
We need to contact
Sklarr's ship.

43:25.568 --> 43:27.504
- How are you gonna do that?
- With this.

43:27.536 --> 43:28.871
It's a comm unit.

43:28.905 --> 43:31.307
I need to modify it,
make contact

43:31.340 --> 43:33.210
and convince him
to let us aboard.

43:34.911 --> 43:36.579
Us?

43:36.612 --> 43:38.881
Yes. There are only
five crew members aboard.

43:38.914 --> 43:42.085
If we can overpower them,
all our problems are solved.

43:44.420 --> 43:45.688
Don't you think
you should ask us

43:45.722 --> 43:48.225
before taking us
on your suicide mission?

43:48.257 --> 43:49.525
This is your chance for glory.

43:49.559 --> 43:51.495
How would we know that?

43:51.527 --> 43:54.897
Huh? We only know
your side of this story.

43:54.931 --> 43:58.135
Okay? What if
you're the bad guy, hmm?

43:58.168 --> 44:00.804
What if you're the one
who's escaped from prison?

44:00.836 --> 44:03.072
And maybe that's why
this guy's hunting you.

44:04.974 --> 44:06.276
Admit it.

44:06.309 --> 44:08.045
The only reason
you believe her story

44:08.077 --> 44:09.478
is because she's a woman.

44:09.512 --> 44:11.248
Or a lady, or whatever she is.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.616
- That's not true!
- Like hell it isn't.

44:13.650 --> 44:16.086
If this was some sort of guy
or a male,

44:16.119 --> 44:17.287
you'd be a lot more hesitant

44:17.320 --> 44:19.155
and a little more skeptical
like me.

44:22.125 --> 44:23.693
Yeah, that's what I thought.

44:23.726 --> 44:26.896
We've been believing her story
from the very start,

44:26.929 --> 44:29.799
and maybe this Sklarr guy
isn't as bad as she says.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.668
All right, maybe
she's an escaped prisoner

44:31.701 --> 44:34.570
and Earth isn't
in any danger at all.

44:34.603 --> 44:37.773
Right? Maybe this guy
hunting her is a bounty hunter,

44:37.806 --> 44:39.975
or a galactic killer. Who knows?

44:40.009 --> 44:42.679
All I know is I'm not
hopping on some spaceship

44:42.711 --> 44:44.414
and flying to who-knows-where.

44:44.447 --> 44:46.048
Maybe this is a test.

44:46.081 --> 44:47.284
What kind of test?

44:47.317 --> 44:50.353
A test to see what humans do
under different circumstances.

44:50.385 --> 44:53.789
See how we react
to different stimuli.

44:53.822 --> 44:56.859
Okay, Jason,
I know you're a psych major,

44:56.893 --> 44:58.762
but even that's
a little far-fetched.

44:59.061 --> 45:00.362
Why?

45:00.396 --> 45:01.698
Why is that far-fetched?

45:01.731 --> 45:03.967
It's no more crazy
than her story.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.003
Okay, I was wrong
to involve you guys. I'll leave.

45:07.036 --> 45:08.739
No, don't.

45:08.771 --> 45:11.240
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

45:11.273 --> 45:13.609
but what I do know is, I just
heard a bunch of screaming,

45:13.643 --> 45:15.545
and I haven't heard
party noises since.

45:15.577 --> 45:17.480
So who would like/
to test out Jason's theory

45:17.514 --> 45:18.749
and go down to the party?

45:22.652 --> 45:24.086
That's what I thought.

45:24.119 --> 45:25.188
I'll do it.

45:27.056 --> 45:29.492
And if something happens,
then we'll know,

45:29.525 --> 45:31.094
and we'll know not to trust her.

45:32.061 --> 45:33.396
It's not safe.

45:33.429 --> 45:34.631
Maybe it is safe.

45:34.664 --> 45:36.567
Maybe they still have corn dogs.

45:37.132 --> 45:38.668
If I'm not back soon,

45:40.903 --> 45:43.139
then we'll know I was wrong
and she was right.

45:49.646 --> 45:53.083
<i>Earnest vlog...
Video Diary number two.</i>

45:53.115 --> 45:54.684
<i>So this just happened.</i>

45:54.717 --> 45:56.353
<i>I just stood up to Sheera.</i>

45:57.519 --> 45:59.755
<i>Sorry, Sheera is this super hot
alien chick</i>

45:59.789 --> 46:03.527
<i>and why did I stand up to her?
To impress Molly.</i>

46:03.559 --> 46:05.695
<i>And no, I haven't really
made my move yet.</i>

46:05.728 --> 46:07.864
<i>But don't worry. I'm...
I'm going to, all right?</i>

46:07.896 --> 46:09.799
<i>I just need to go down
to this festival</i>

46:09.833 --> 46:11.934
<i>and prove that
nothing bad is happening.</i>

46:11.967 --> 46:13.536
<i>And the screams were just,</i>

46:13.570 --> 46:16.039
<i>I don't know,
people having fun?</i>

46:16.072 --> 46:17.707
<i>And I got to prove
that this Sklarr guy</i>

46:17.739 --> 46:19.542
<i>isn't as bad as she says.</i>

46:19.576 --> 46:20.844
<i>"He's the bad guy."</i>

46:20.876 --> 46:23.246
<i>Allegedly. I mean, aliens?</i>

46:23.278 --> 46:25.148
<i>Come on.</i>

46:26.449 --> 46:27.818
<i>I'm gonna need a gun.</i>

46:34.356 --> 46:35.625
Oh.

46:36.793 --> 46:38.628
Your planet is quite pretty.

46:40.329 --> 46:41.664
You're thinking of the ship?

46:41.697 --> 46:44.000
No. Kyra, my first officer.

46:44.032 --> 46:46.235
She came to rescue me
and got captured.

46:46.936 --> 46:48.004
Huh.

46:48.036 --> 46:50.272
You know, I think
you have every right

46:50.306 --> 46:51.942
to be frightened and confused.

46:51.974 --> 46:52.842
Oh.

46:52.876 --> 46:55.112
I'm a warrior.
I'm not frightened.

46:57.179 --> 46:58.347
Just confused.

46:59.949 --> 47:02.219
- You care about her?
- Of course.

47:03.253 --> 47:04.521
If she's still alive,

47:04.554 --> 47:06.690
she's probably
being tortured right now.

47:07.257 --> 47:08.358
Don't worry.

47:08.391 --> 47:10.159
I'm sure she's a warrior, too.

47:47.597 --> 47:49.332
- Sklarr.
- What do we do?

47:49.364 --> 47:51.333
We prepare to defend ourselves.

47:51.367 --> 47:52.903
But Earnest is still out there.

47:52.936 --> 47:54.170
Sklarr may have
already found him.

47:54.202 --> 47:55.938
That was the sound
of a disassembler.

47:55.972 --> 47:57.874
- Well, that doesn't sound good.
- It isn't.

47:57.907 --> 48:00.443
How long do you think
before this Sklarr guy finds us?

48:00.476 --> 48:03.012
Not long.
We need to set a trap.

48:03.045 --> 48:04.213
With what?

48:04.246 --> 48:05.281
With this.

48:17.092 --> 48:18.194
Bingo.

48:27.302 --> 48:28.438
He's here.

48:29.838 --> 48:33.876
Come out, you won't be harmed.

48:33.909 --> 48:36.512
You could make a deal with me
like your friend here.

48:36.545 --> 48:37.980
He's not my friend.

48:38.014 --> 48:40.784
Then maybe you can
take his place.

48:44.619 --> 48:45.822
What do you say?

48:45.855 --> 48:47.324
Would you like to make a deal?

48:48.157 --> 48:50.827
The female prisoner
has escaped us.

48:50.860 --> 48:52.296
She's not of your world.

48:53.295 --> 48:56.165
I just want to take her
back to our planet

48:56.199 --> 48:58.134
for a nice trial.

48:58.166 --> 49:00.903
Very safe and very fair trial.

49:00.936 --> 49:04.407
No torture, no anal probes.

49:05.407 --> 49:07.476
Just a nice, fair trial.

49:08.143 --> 49:09.411
What did she do?

49:09.445 --> 49:10.880
That is none of your concern.

49:10.913 --> 49:12.916
I'm making it my concern.

49:12.949 --> 49:14.918
Well, she's... She's a traitor.

49:14.951 --> 49:16.452
How about that?

49:16.485 --> 49:19.822
Look up the word "traitor"
in the dictionary,

49:19.856 --> 49:25.028
then you'll see a pretty darn
good description of her.

49:25.061 --> 49:26.829
Funny how
one government's traitor

49:26.862 --> 49:28.297
can be another one's hero.

49:28.331 --> 49:31.034
Ah! So you've met Sheera.

49:31.833 --> 49:35.571
Who do you trust more,
her or me?

49:35.605 --> 49:37.240
You almost had me, asshole.

49:37.739 --> 49:39.575
Look at this place.

49:39.608 --> 49:42.778
What happened to all
the people that were here, huh?

49:42.811 --> 49:45.014
They came looking
for alien life,

49:45.047 --> 49:47.416
and look what they got
in return.

49:47.449 --> 49:49.284
I didn't do this.

49:49.318 --> 49:50.988
Your friend Jerry did.

49:51.487 --> 49:52.956
What?

49:53.655 --> 49:55.224
Why, Jerry?

49:55.257 --> 49:58.561
You know.
You were bullied by them too.

50:00.329 --> 50:04.434
Well, he's not laughing
at either of us anymore.

50:05.434 --> 50:06.835
You're welcome.

50:06.869 --> 50:08.972
Did he make you do this?

50:09.005 --> 50:11.807
Did you do this
to Jerry, Sklarr?

50:11.840 --> 50:14.277
Oh, I didn't
have to do anything.

50:15.644 --> 50:17.514
He's naturally gifted.

50:17.547 --> 50:19.315
Where's Patrick, Jerry?

50:19.815 --> 50:20.884
What do you mean?

50:20.916 --> 50:23.519
You and Patrick
are always together.

50:23.552 --> 50:25.321
Everyone in school knows that.

50:26.755 --> 50:28.391
Did you do it?

50:28.423 --> 50:30.059
Did Sklarr kill him?

50:30.092 --> 50:32.795
No, that was me.
We had a falling out.

50:32.829 --> 50:34.597
I always thought
you had a screw loose.

50:45.541 --> 50:46.610
Hello?

50:47.976 --> 50:50.012
Is one of you is still alive?

50:50.679 --> 50:52.815
That's a very loud weapon.

50:52.849 --> 50:54.651
Loud and effective.

50:54.684 --> 50:56.887
Oh. Is Jerry dead?

50:58.320 --> 51:00.257
- Yep.
- Too bad.

51:00.822 --> 51:02.425
He was quite useful.

51:03.126 --> 51:04.294
At what?

51:04.960 --> 51:07.129
Helping me find you.

51:11.199 --> 51:13.035
Well, that wasn't
one of your weapons.

51:13.068 --> 51:14.471
No, that was a gunshot.

51:14.503 --> 51:15.904
Had to be Earnest.

51:15.938 --> 51:17.039
But we don't have any guns.

51:17.072 --> 51:19.442
No, but Earnest knows
how to use one.

51:19.474 --> 51:22.144
And knowing him, the first thing
he did was manage to find one.

51:22.577 --> 51:23.746
I hope so.

51:23.778 --> 51:25.447
That last one
was a non-lethal blast.

51:25.481 --> 51:26.516
He could still be alive.

51:26.882 --> 51:28.250
Thank you.

51:28.284 --> 51:30.019
But that might not be good news.

51:30.052 --> 51:31.653
Sklarr spared him for a reason.

51:31.686 --> 51:32.788
Like what?

51:32.822 --> 51:34.090
Torture.

51:34.123 --> 51:36.326
That means we might still
have a chance to save him.

51:36.358 --> 51:37.293
Not for long.

51:37.326 --> 51:39.329
Come on,
we have to save Earnest.

51:41.797 --> 51:44.266
It's an impressive
little weapon.

51:45.201 --> 51:47.137
For a human, of course.

51:48.503 --> 51:50.906
It's a bit loud...

51:50.940 --> 51:52.541
for my liking,

51:52.574 --> 51:55.311
but I'm guessing that's
what you're going for, yeah?

51:57.280 --> 52:00.550
Let's see. How does this work?

52:01.884 --> 52:03.420
Please don't.

52:05.922 --> 52:07.157
Then...

52:07.789 --> 52:09.592
tell me where Sheera is.

52:10.525 --> 52:12.161
- Who?
- Ah!

52:12.728 --> 52:14.797
See, now, you...

52:14.829 --> 52:17.400
You're forcing me
to perform a small

52:17.432 --> 52:20.036
yet painful act of violence
on you

52:20.068 --> 52:23.105
to let you know I mean business.

52:26.976 --> 52:30.079
Oh, yeah, that was painful.

52:30.112 --> 52:33.916
I liked that.
Let's try another one,

52:33.949 --> 52:36.051
- the way it was intended.
- No.

52:36.085 --> 52:38.420
Stop.

52:38.454 --> 52:41.124
- Stop.
- Then tell me where she is.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.163
Oh, no.

52:46.695 --> 52:48.297
You're in pain.

52:49.632 --> 52:51.334
Tell you what I'm going to do.

52:56.137 --> 52:59.108
I'm gonna show some mercy

52:59.775 --> 53:01.144
and make it quick.

53:02.244 --> 53:04.079
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

53:05.213 --> 53:06.750
I've seen the plans.

53:07.849 --> 53:09.418
What plans?

53:10.753 --> 53:12.355
Sheera's planet's defenses.

53:13.556 --> 53:14.657
So?

53:15.657 --> 53:18.060
So don't you have a thing
that can, like,

53:18.094 --> 53:19.563
read my mind or something?

53:21.496 --> 53:22.665
I do.

53:25.300 --> 53:27.135
Hmm.

53:27.168 --> 53:29.271
I can't believe
Jerry did all this.

53:29.304 --> 53:31.139
Well, you'd be surprised

53:31.172 --> 53:33.442
what power can do to the mind.

53:34.409 --> 53:37.045
Once he saw
what he could do with this,

53:37.079 --> 53:40.883
he couldn't wait to use it
on his fellow Earthlings.

53:40.916 --> 53:44.054
Yeah, well,
he was bullied a lot.

53:45.387 --> 53:47.356
Here and in high school too.

53:47.889 --> 53:49.125
High school?

53:49.157 --> 53:51.627
Yeah, it's a place
where people go to learn.

53:52.762 --> 53:53.896
Or be tortured.

53:53.929 --> 53:55.898
Oh, yes, yes.

53:55.931 --> 53:58.835
We have such institutions
where I'm from.

53:59.601 --> 54:00.902
But on ours,

54:00.936 --> 54:03.106
we kill the weak
and the useless.

54:04.172 --> 54:05.841
Glad I didn't go there.

54:21.123 --> 54:23.126
Oh, thank you, thank you.

54:23.525 --> 54:24.559
Don't go.

54:24.592 --> 54:25.694
He's wounded.

54:25.728 --> 54:27.496
There's nothing more dangerous
than a wounded animal.

54:27.530 --> 54:28.931
You have to look after his leg.

54:28.963 --> 54:31.000
- We have to get him out of here.
- I have to go after Sklarr!

54:31.032 --> 54:32.335
She's right.

54:32.367 --> 54:34.371
Uh... Collect his weapons.

54:37.139 --> 54:38.341
Nice knots.

54:38.873 --> 54:40.242
Untie me.

54:40.275 --> 54:42.177
Dude, I don't know if I can.

54:44.679 --> 54:46.715
Ugh, damn it!

54:48.050 --> 54:50.952
The women on this planet...

54:50.985 --> 54:52.788
First, they take my seed,

54:53.956 --> 54:55.625
and then shoot me in the leg.

54:58.494 --> 55:00.463
If anyone finds out about this,

55:00.496 --> 55:03.700
I'll be the laughing stock
of this galaxy.

55:05.201 --> 55:07.070
Oh, look, a squirrel.

55:26.655 --> 55:29.559
Sklarr's probably calling an
intergalactic Uber right now.

55:31.159 --> 55:32.428
He won't.

55:32.862 --> 55:34.163
Why not?

55:34.195 --> 55:35.797
Because I've wounded him twice.

55:35.831 --> 55:37.066
This is personal.

55:37.099 --> 55:38.234
He wants me dead.

55:39.034 --> 55:41.137
What did you do to my leg?

55:41.170 --> 55:42.438
It was broken. And now it's not.

55:42.471 --> 55:43.806
That's all you need to know.

55:43.838 --> 55:45.708
If he really wanted to harm you,
he would have.

55:45.740 --> 55:48.009
He probably wanted you
for a trophy.

55:48.043 --> 55:49.711
So what do we do now?

55:49.744 --> 55:51.179
I know what I'm gonna do.

55:51.213 --> 55:53.350
Earnest, don't start.

55:55.016 --> 55:56.385
I'm not.

55:57.186 --> 55:59.189
I'm gonna apologize to Sheera.

56:00.422 --> 56:02.758
You were telling the truth
and I didn't believe you.

56:03.925 --> 56:05.628
I'm sorry.

56:05.661 --> 56:08.563
You are a male and you remain
true to your fellow male.

56:08.597 --> 56:10.800
It is what happens
with our people too.

56:10.833 --> 56:13.735
It's always a battle
that never makes any sense.

56:13.768 --> 56:14.936
So we gonna go after him?

56:14.969 --> 56:16.705
- No.
- No?

56:16.739 --> 56:19.208
No. We will remain here
and he'll come to us.

56:19.240 --> 56:21.476
We're much stronger together
than we are apart.

56:21.510 --> 56:24.147
Okay, then we'll stick
to our original plan.

56:24.179 --> 56:26.382
We'll go back to camp
and set up traps.

56:26.414 --> 56:27.949
And if things go sideways,

56:27.983 --> 56:30.553
we'll go with Sheera to the ship
and help her take it over.

56:31.253 --> 56:33.389
When did you become so macho?

56:33.422 --> 56:35.224
I just needed
the right motivation.

56:36.057 --> 56:36.960
Can you walk?

56:37.960 --> 56:39.362
Yeah.

56:39.394 --> 56:41.431
You're pretty good at this.

56:42.530 --> 56:44.366
Okay, let's keep an eye out
for Sklarr.

56:44.400 --> 56:46.202
Hey, it's a brave
new world, buddy.

56:46.235 --> 56:47.903
Tell me about it.

56:55.177 --> 56:56.278
<i>Yes, Admiral Sklarr?</i>

56:56.311 --> 56:58.647
- <i>Do you have her?</i>
- Not yet.

56:58.681 --> 57:01.117
Admiral, may I remind you
of the time.

57:01.150 --> 57:02.585
- We must get...
- <i>Shut it!</i>

57:02.617 --> 57:04.987
I'm aware of what we must do.

57:05.019 --> 57:09.891
Just send me a TS-7 vial
and injection cylinder, please.

57:09.925 --> 57:10.726
Are you injured?

57:10.759 --> 57:13.596
Did I not just ask
for a TS-7 vial

57:13.628 --> 57:15.498
- and injection cylinder?
- <i>Yes.</i>

57:15.530 --> 57:17.666
Of course I'm injured!

57:17.699 --> 57:21.236
<i>I was in a battle
with a very large beast.</i>

57:21.269 --> 57:22.371
Several, actually.

57:22.403 --> 57:25.240
And it injured...
They injured my leg.

57:25.273 --> 57:28.577
Uh, I emerged victorious,
of course.

57:28.610 --> 57:31.780
But I need to replenish
the nanobots in my system.

57:31.813 --> 57:34.250
But the TS-7 is for
emergency priority one,

57:34.282 --> 57:35.518
or combat only.

57:35.550 --> 57:36.652
Should I send down support?

57:36.684 --> 57:38.721
Just... Just send
what I asked for. Please?

57:38.753 --> 57:42.692
I don't need any help
capturing a girl,

57:42.724 --> 57:46.695
<i>who could never injure my leg
in a million years, by the way.</i>

57:47.695 --> 57:49.731
She's traveling
with three humans.

57:49.764 --> 57:51.000
I want you to scan
for life forms

57:51.032 --> 57:52.935
and let me know
when you have their location.

57:59.275 --> 58:01.510
Admiral Sklarr, I presume?

58:03.012 --> 58:05.381
- Hello.
- I knew it.

58:08.083 --> 58:09.485
We don't have much time.

58:09.818 --> 58:10.953
Ooh.

58:12.021 --> 58:13.689
Ah, greetings

58:13.722 --> 58:18.461
to all of my fellow
alien lovers out there.

58:18.494 --> 58:20.796
It is I, Star Meadow,

58:20.829 --> 58:24.734
otherwise known as
Princess Andromeda.

58:24.766 --> 58:26.801
You're joining me here
once again

58:26.835 --> 58:28.570
in my off-grid cabin

58:28.603 --> 58:31.273
where I've been living
for the last seven years

58:31.306 --> 58:35.544
with the sole purpose
of connecting deeper

58:35.577 --> 58:39.248
with our brothers and sisters
from outer space.

58:39.280 --> 58:43.052
And I have some
exciting news for you.

58:43.085 --> 58:47.222
Once again, I, Star Meadow,

58:47.255 --> 58:50.525
otherwise known as
Princess Andromeda,

58:50.559 --> 58:52.862
was visited last night

58:52.894 --> 58:55.498
by our alien friends.

58:55.530 --> 58:58.867
I was chosen to be the vessel

58:58.900 --> 59:02.605
within which new life
will be brought forth.

59:02.637 --> 59:05.540
Not human life, not alien life,

59:05.574 --> 59:08.978
but a blend.
A beautiful, beautiful blend!

59:09.010 --> 59:13.983
Last night, the captain
took me aboard the ship,

59:15.083 --> 59:17.819
and I am now carrying his child.

59:18.753 --> 59:24.059
I don't recall
the actual insemination.

59:25.561 --> 59:28.698
But there is no doubt
that I am pregnant.

59:30.798 --> 59:31.833
You know,
this kind of reminds me

59:31.867 --> 59:34.570
when my dad
used to take me hunting.

59:34.603 --> 59:37.039
He always got pissed 'cause
I was never really that into it.

59:38.039 --> 59:39.275
Oh, me too.

59:39.307 --> 59:41.576
My dad always wanted
a tough guy for a son,

59:41.610 --> 59:43.413
but ended up with me.

59:45.179 --> 59:48.416
Who knows? They probably would
have been happier with daughters.

59:48.449 --> 59:50.552
We both did okay out there.

59:50.585 --> 59:53.188
You faced up to Sklarr.
And got rid of Jerry. I...

59:53.222 --> 59:56.359
Who knows how many more
he would have killed, man?

59:56.391 --> 59:59.394
Yeah, that's what worries me.

59:59.427 --> 01:00:00.762
The same thing happened to us.

01:00:00.795 --> 01:00:02.464
I mean, we were bullied,
just like he was.

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.700
We... We don't all handle it
the same way.

01:00:04.733 --> 01:00:07.637
Maybe having dads
is what mattered for us.

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:09.038
Yeah.

01:00:10.838 --> 01:00:12.541
How long do you think we have?

01:00:12.574 --> 01:00:14.577
Have until what?

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:17.981
Come on.
Until that Sklarr guy kills us.

01:00:19.347 --> 01:00:22.050
Sheera wounded him twice.
We have a chance.

01:00:23.485 --> 01:00:25.054
You know,

01:00:26.355 --> 01:00:27.722
if she gets stranded here,

01:00:27.755 --> 01:00:29.858
we could get a lot of money
for that crystal.

01:00:30.759 --> 01:00:32.827
Man, that's always your angle,
isn't it?

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:34.663
What about
the rest of the world?

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.599
Why?

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:38.768
They get the plans,
they'll save the world

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.170
and we get rich.
What's wrong with that?

01:00:45.474 --> 01:00:46.676
Come on.

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.378
I'm Dr. Jill Landress.

01:00:49.411 --> 01:00:50.846
Oh.

01:00:50.878 --> 01:00:52.480
I assumed that.

01:00:52.514 --> 01:00:54.650
I've enjoyed our conversations.

01:00:54.682 --> 01:00:56.018
Am I what you pictured?

01:00:56.385 --> 01:00:58.087
Oh, my God.

01:00:58.887 --> 01:00:59.889
Better.

01:01:01.356 --> 01:01:03.225
When does the invasion begin?

01:01:03.257 --> 01:01:06.828
As soon as we get rid of
the one person who can stop it.

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:10.865
Did you find them yet?

01:01:10.898 --> 01:01:11.833
Yes, Admiral.

01:01:11.867 --> 01:01:13.803
I'm sending the location
to you now.

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:18.074
Perfect.

01:01:26.581 --> 01:01:28.016
You have a cute laugh.

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:33.923
So, how are you feeling?

01:01:34.456 --> 01:01:35.892
I feel good.

01:01:38.059 --> 01:01:39.195
What's wrong?

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:41.864
I don't know. It just...
It seems so unrealistic

01:01:41.896 --> 01:01:43.898
that with only a few minutes
of training,

01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:47.802
I'm gonna help take down
an intergalactic badass?

01:01:47.835 --> 01:01:50.171
It hasn't been
just a few minutes.

01:01:50.204 --> 01:01:52.708
How young were you
the first time you felt tough?

01:01:54.076 --> 01:01:56.112
I always felt tough.

01:01:56.445 --> 01:01:58.114
Exactly.

01:01:58.146 --> 01:02:01.217
You may not realize this, but you've
been training for this your whole life.

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.085
And this may be your moment.

01:02:03.117 --> 01:02:05.054
Your moment.

01:02:05.086 --> 01:02:07.190
And after this,
nothing will be the same.

01:02:08.456 --> 01:02:10.492
Just remember
Sklarr's part nanotech

01:02:10.525 --> 01:02:12.260
and full of surprises.

01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:15.664
So let's just be prepared
and not take him for granted.

01:02:17.132 --> 01:02:18.067
We got this.

01:02:25.106 --> 01:02:26.509
This is a nerve agent.

01:02:26.541 --> 01:02:28.576
I'm going to inject you
with a few drops.

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:31.680
You will feel pain
like you've never felt.

01:02:31.713 --> 01:02:33.883
The pain will dissipate.

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:37.253
If you tell me the truth,
I'll end things quickly.

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:41.023
If not, I'll inject you
with a few more drops,

01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:43.858
and then a few more,

01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:45.527
and once
I've drained the syringe,

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:47.263
it will be too late for you

01:02:47.295 --> 01:02:48.330
and you will be dead.

01:02:49.331 --> 01:02:50.633
Are we clear?

01:02:51.733 --> 01:02:52.935
Hold her arm down.

01:02:58.907 --> 01:03:01.710
Well, that was truly horrible.

01:03:01.742 --> 01:03:03.246
Better him than you.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.215
Well, we're committed now.

01:03:07.248 --> 01:03:09.451
There are two other guards
to take out on this ship.

01:03:09.483 --> 01:03:11.353
Then we'll grab Sheera
and go home.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:13.155
What about Sklarr?

01:03:13.188 --> 01:03:14.590
Strand him on Earth.

01:03:14.623 --> 01:03:17.259
We can't do that.
He'll destroy this planet.

01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:19.929
This planet is an isolated
speck in the galaxy.

01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:22.597
No planet is an isolated speck
in the galaxy.

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:25.166
You know that.
It's all intertwined.

01:03:25.199 --> 01:03:26.835
Well, then you better hope
Sheera takes care of him

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.637
before he summons
the battle cruisers.

01:03:29.237 --> 01:03:30.172
Wait.

01:03:30.204 --> 01:03:31.206
Battle cruisers?

01:03:31.239 --> 01:03:34.576
I have ships positioned
throughout the galaxy.

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:37.413
This trip was meant
to be a recon

01:03:37.445 --> 01:03:40.815
and to get rid of the obstacle.

01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:43.686
She does not seem to be
that big of an obstacle.

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:46.722
Oh, you'd be surprised.

01:03:46.755 --> 01:03:50.326
Even she hasn't realized
her full potential.

01:03:50.358 --> 01:03:52.194
You can destroy her, right?

01:03:53.327 --> 01:03:54.329
Yeah.

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:59.068
Don't worry,
I will emerge victorious.

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:16.352
Oh, in case you guys
didn't know,

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:19.153
I feel a tad defenseless
compared to you guys.

01:04:19.186 --> 01:04:20.221
You're our backup.

01:04:20.255 --> 01:04:22.191
If this goes well,
you shouldn't see any combat.

01:04:22.224 --> 01:04:23.926
Yeah, I'm not gonna see
any combat

01:04:23.958 --> 01:04:25.594
'cause my eyes are gonna be
closed the whole time.

01:04:25.626 --> 01:04:27.228
- Quiet, you!
- Ha.

01:04:29.331 --> 01:04:30.298
Don't run.

01:04:30.331 --> 01:04:33.134
He's deliberately
making his presence known.

01:04:33.168 --> 01:04:36.472
It's a battle tactic designed to
terrorize the enemy and make him flee.

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:37.706
Yeah, I'm not gonna flee,

01:04:37.739 --> 01:04:39.474
but I'm gonna shit myself,
if that's all right.

01:04:39.507 --> 01:04:41.176
- Earnest!
- Sorry.

01:04:44.646 --> 01:04:45.914
Oh... fuck!

01:04:45.947 --> 01:04:47.750
No, no. Don't move! Don't move!

01:04:50.018 --> 01:04:52.353
<i>Okay, video log...
I mean, uh...</i>

01:04:52.387 --> 01:04:53.622
<i>Earnest Di...</i>

01:04:53.655 --> 01:04:55.624
<i>Whatever. Number three.</i>

01:04:55.657 --> 01:04:58.059
<i>I was wrong
about everything, okay?</i>

01:04:58.092 --> 01:05:00.728
<i>Sklarr is a bad guy
and super dangerous.</i>

01:05:00.762 --> 01:05:02.831
<i>Sheera is actually
a good alien.</i>

01:05:02.864 --> 01:05:05.434
<i>And Molly doesn't like me
like that, so...</i>

01:05:25.052 --> 01:05:26.821
Well, there goes Earnest.

01:05:28.757 --> 01:05:30.092
Follow me.

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.032
Make it night.

01:05:36.697 --> 01:05:39.867
- Sklarr!
- Oh, Sheera.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.803
Love your suit.

01:05:42.304 --> 01:05:43.806
This ends now!

01:05:44.306 --> 01:05:46.375
Yes. Yes, it does.

01:05:46.407 --> 01:05:49.877
Because I'm going to take that
home with me

01:05:49.911 --> 01:05:53.782
and then use it to destroy
your wretched little planet.

01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:55.818
Not today.

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:58.086
No, no. Technically,
it'd be tomorrow

01:05:58.119 --> 01:05:59.954
because of the time difference
and all.

01:05:59.987 --> 01:06:02.357
Oh, funny.

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:05.394
Let's settle this like men.

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:07.563
Dance off!

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:21.277
<i>You don't have the power
to stop me.</i>

01:06:22.577 --> 01:06:24.780
<i>Are we having fun yet?</i>

01:06:24.813 --> 01:06:26.816
<i>Are we having fun yet?</i>

01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:28.584
<i>Are we having...</i>

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:55.378
<i>Are we to believe</i>

01:06:56.411 --> 01:06:57.880
<i>we're getting up?</i>

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.851
<i>I need the fuel to fight.</i>

01:07:02.617 --> 01:07:05.187
<i>Tomorrow becomes today.</i>

01:07:06.353 --> 01:07:08.523
<i>Shining the light.</i>

01:07:09.324 --> 01:07:11.626
<i>Memory trance.</i>

01:07:11.659 --> 01:07:13.461
<i>You know, it's hard.</i>

01:07:13.494 --> 01:07:14.963
<i>Just another day.</i>

01:07:15.963 --> 01:07:18.733
<i>And more. And more.</i>

01:07:18.766 --> 01:07:20.301
<i>And more.</i>

01:07:22.036 --> 01:07:24.005
Admiral Sklarr,

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:28.310
you have fallen at the hands
of our great warrior, Sheera.

01:07:28.342 --> 01:07:30.178
Because you are
a worthy opponent,

01:07:30.211 --> 01:07:32.713
I'll perform
the ritual of Gregara

01:07:32.746 --> 01:07:34.849
to cleanse your essence.

01:07:34.882 --> 01:07:37.118
Then you will be welcomed
into the next realm

01:07:37.152 --> 01:07:39.788
of Secara and eternal peace.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.458
But first, some gifts

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:45.527
to commemorate your strengths
as a warrior.

01:07:47.061 --> 01:07:50.833
Crystals from the mines
of Me Clan

01:07:50.865 --> 01:07:52.601
to help show you your way.

01:07:55.436 --> 01:07:57.072
I'll just put this here.

01:07:58.739 --> 01:08:00.942
Some nourishment
for your journey.

01:08:04.179 --> 01:08:06.282
Well, it'd end up here anyway.

01:08:07.581 --> 01:08:10.219
And an arm of Langdor

01:08:10.251 --> 01:08:12.121
to help you record
your journey.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.529
And we're down
to your final gift,

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.096
a full makeover.

01:08:27.702 --> 01:08:30.072
Looking a little ashy.

01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:40.483
Is this all that's left of him?

01:08:41.048 --> 01:08:42.484
Pretty much.

01:08:43.585 --> 01:08:45.688
Who are you?

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.688
I'm Venaka.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.490
From the Galactic Council.

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:52.461
I've been placed here to keep
an eye on the humans' Area 51.

01:08:52.493 --> 01:08:55.029
Were you aware of my mission
to retrieve the orb?

01:08:55.462 --> 01:08:56.163
Of course.

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.033
My race is clairvoyant.

01:08:58.064 --> 01:08:59.701
I'm here to make sure
that you stay safe

01:08:59.734 --> 01:09:01.203
until the designated time.

01:09:01.935 --> 01:09:03.005
Holy shit!

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:05.707
Area 51 is run by aliens.

01:09:07.006 --> 01:09:08.277
Can you help me get home?

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.446
You won't need
my help for that.

01:09:29.831 --> 01:09:31.500
Put your hands down.

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:32.768
I just saved your lives.

01:09:35.036 --> 01:09:36.238
Where's Kyra?

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:37.706
She's taking the bridge.

01:09:44.444 --> 01:09:49.652
NPC clone. NPC clone.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:55.324
NPC clone.

01:10:03.765 --> 01:10:05.501
- Kyra!
- Sheera!

01:10:06.533 --> 01:10:07.969
- Thank God you're alive!
- Thank God.

01:10:08.002 --> 01:10:10.639
- You're okay. I was so worried.
- Me, too.

01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:13.408
Do you how to fly this ship?

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.810
Oh, yeah. It's, uh...
It's a T-89.

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:17.378
Wrong. It's a T-69.

01:10:17.412 --> 01:10:18.914
- She's got it.
- Same difference.

01:10:18.947 --> 01:10:20.583
Fine. Everyone, man a station.

01:10:21.716 --> 01:10:23.852
You mean, woman a station.

01:10:23.885 --> 01:10:26.088
Don't make me sorry I saved you.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:27.922
Who's this?

01:10:27.956 --> 01:10:29.324
Oh, new friend from Earth.

01:10:29.356 --> 01:10:31.460
She helped kill Sklarr.

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:33.362
You know, don't worry.
She's one of us.

01:10:33.962 --> 01:10:35.264
Bad-ass.

01:10:36.664 --> 01:10:38.966
Vice Admiral, what about
Sklarr's warships?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.769
Sklarr ruled with fear.

01:10:40.801 --> 01:10:42.403
And his soldiers
were his slaves.

01:10:42.436 --> 01:10:46.073
Once news of his death spreads,
a truce will be negotiated.

01:10:46.106 --> 01:10:48.042
Now let's get out of here.

01:10:48.076 --> 01:10:49.444
Full speed ahead.

01:11:11.131 --> 01:11:13.335
- Where are we?
- We're home.

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:18.073
Thank you all.

01:11:18.105 --> 01:11:20.842
I'm sorry we had to meet
under such circumstances.

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:24.613
So this is space.

01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:27.815
This is space.

01:11:27.849 --> 01:11:31.386
Is it true that your planet
is governed by females?

01:11:31.418 --> 01:11:35.056
Yes, but we're more
what your past ancestors

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:36.757
would call a commune.

01:11:36.791 --> 01:11:38.393
We live in harmony with nature

01:11:38.426 --> 01:11:41.330
and we care for our planet
as it cares for us.

01:11:44.231 --> 01:11:46.201
Sounds wonderful.

01:11:47.502 --> 01:11:49.604
You know, why...
Why did you help us?

01:11:49.636 --> 01:11:51.005
Help me.

01:11:51.038 --> 01:11:54.809
Your father saved his father
at the Battle of Greep-Nur.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:57.445
My father wasn't a warrior.

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:59.815
- What?
- He was a farmer.

01:12:00.314 --> 01:12:02.384
Ah, hands down.

01:12:02.417 --> 01:12:04.186
I know what they can do.

01:12:04.786 --> 01:12:05.854
Thank you.

01:12:05.886 --> 01:12:09.023
This is exactly what I need
to turn things around

01:12:09.056 --> 01:12:10.658
and make it a special success.

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:14.395
But you didn't know
my hands could do that, bitch.

01:12:16.096 --> 01:12:17.198
Nice one.

01:12:17.231 --> 01:12:18.701
Let's get out of here for real.

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:23.939
You're shaking.

01:12:23.971 --> 01:12:25.606
Are you reconsidering
your decision?

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:28.911
No, it's... It's not that.

01:12:30.211 --> 01:12:31.780
It's the friends you lost.

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:38.019
I don't know. I guess it's just
all hitting me right now.

01:12:38.051 --> 01:12:40.288
It's gonna take time
for that to pass.

01:12:40.954 --> 01:12:42.757
And sometimes it never does.

01:12:44.391 --> 01:12:45.827
You're one of us now.

01:12:49.764 --> 01:12:50.932
Too soon.

01:13:14.154 --> 01:13:18.559
Hi. Most of you know me as
Dr. Jill Landress from Area 51,

01:13:18.592 --> 01:13:21.829
but really, I'm Venaka
from the Galactic council.

01:13:21.863 --> 01:13:25.133
I was hoping to broker a peace
between Sheera and Sklarr,

01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:26.467
but that didn't work out.

01:13:26.501 --> 01:13:28.970
So I'm going to launch
an invasion of Earth.

01:13:29.002 --> 01:13:32.039
If any of you aren't dead or
turned inside out when it's over,

01:13:32.073 --> 01:13:33.742
I'd love to be your friend.

01:13:33.774 --> 01:13:35.344
Bye. Thanks for watching.

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:22.454
