HELP ME!
Someone help me, please!

00:13.638 --> 00:16.563
Will you shut the fuck up?

00:21.488 --> 00:24.907
No, Pando, please.
I'm not fucking bullshitting.

00:24.951 --> 00:26.652
I'm telling you
the truth!

00:26.655 --> 00:28.535
Ring Deirdre.
We're doing this job.

00:28.540 --> 00:30.558

10 grand back.

00:30.568 --> 00:33.526
I'll give you 15.
I promise you.

00:33.531 --> 00:35.386
I'm gonna get
fucking money.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.790
Ring Deirdre!

00:36.831 --> 00:40.097
Alright, Jimmy.
What's her number?

00:40.190 --> 00:43.254
93891...

00:43.354 --> 00:45.423
Fuck, no! She's at
her mom's place.

00:45.425 --> 00:48.546
Fuck, I don't know
her number.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.200
-Call 013.
-What's it under?

00:53.684 --> 00:56.882
Fletcher! Crusher C.

00:56.927 --> 01:01.818
Fuck, that was his nickname!
What was his real name?

01:01.830 --> 01:06.829
-John or something.
-Robert Henry Fletcher, yeah.

01:07.094 --> 01:10.059
Robert! It was
Robert Fletcher.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.190
Hallo! Could I have a number for
a Robert Fletcher in...

01:20.250 --> 01:21.308
Bottany.

01:21.580 --> 01:23.523
What street?

01:25.437 --> 01:30.300
No, fuck! I don't know.
I've been there a million times,

01:30.324 --> 01:32.643
...but know how to
get there.

01:32.662 --> 01:38.100
Somewhere in Bottany.
Bottany Road?

01:38.273 --> 01:41.256
There's a P. Fletcher
in Bottany Road.

01:41.336 --> 01:44.930
No. They live down on
one of them back street.

01:44.950 --> 01:49.019
Anything else
under "R" in Bottany?

01:49.516 --> 01:52.531
Ah, nothing.
Thanks very much.

01:52.550 --> 01:54.173
Nothing.

01:55.087 --> 01:58.054
Must be a silent number.

01:59.274 --> 02:01.471
Sorry, Jim.

02:05.005 --> 02:08.982

03:47.860 --> 03:51.000
If you're going through
some sort of shit in your life...

03:51.030 --> 03:54.190
...chances are someone else has been
through the same thing before you.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.550
And they've written it down.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.640
Some poet or philosopher has been
through the same type of crap...

04:00.650 --> 04:02.824
...and they've
written about it.

04:02.850 --> 04:07.700
And when you find that poem or
that piece of writing and you think:

04:07.800 --> 04:12.400
Bloody hell! This bastard
just summed it all up.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.900
It's kind of comforting.
Know what I mean?

04:20.356 --> 04:22.261
Yeah, fuck it!

04:22.964 --> 04:27.300
The chinese reckon
that man is a bridge...

04:27.348 --> 04:30.020
...between heaven and hell.

04:30.050 --> 04:33.770
The middle ground between
the yin and the yang.

04:34.452 --> 04:35.787
The yin...

04:36.294 --> 04:38.979
...and the yang.

04:39.710 --> 04:42.450
Me and my little brother
Jimmy here...

04:42.500 --> 04:45.240
...we got these
tattoos one day.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.210
One side is white with
a little bit of black...

04:48.220 --> 04:52.465
...and the other side is black
with a little bit of white.

04:52.828 --> 04:58.110
See, something that's good
can have a little bit of bad in it...

04:58.120 --> 05:03.100
...and something that's bad,
still has a little bit of good.

05:16.669 --> 05:17.700
Times of evil!

05:17.750 --> 05:21.950
We'll come tumbling down
like the walls of Jericho!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.373
Seek salvation in the Lord!

05:26.732 --> 05:29.750
I was talking to Pando.

05:29.770 --> 05:32.820
Yeah? What were you
talking about?

05:32.840 --> 05:37.000
-You know, a few things.
-Fucking mates with Pando, eh?

05:37.050 --> 05:41.000
-What do you mean?
-He knows about you and Kiwi Bob.

05:41.050 --> 05:44.200
-How does he know that?
-Pando fucking knows.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.950
-Did he talk about your bloody work?
-Nah, come on.

05:47.960 --> 05:52.400
-Wouldn't be surprised.
-Boys! Boy's night out, eh?

05:53.550 --> 05:55.506
We got fucking
beautiful girls.

05:55.685 --> 05:58.535
-Les, got a cigarett?
-Yeah, alright.

05:59.725 --> 06:01.990
-Come and look, mate.
-No, mate.

06:03.306 --> 06:06.900
Jimmy, can you roll it
for me? Can't roll.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.900
-Hey, Les!
-Rocket.

06:10.910 --> 06:11.940
Hi, Jim!

06:12.876 --> 06:16.370
-This is my sister Alex.
-I didn't know you had a sister.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.940
I got four sisters, mate.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.870
-Are you from Mudgey, love?
-Yeah, just got here.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.010
-Fucking nuthouse, isn't it?
-Yeah.

06:25.020 --> 06:28.000
If this fucker gives you
trouble, you let me know.

06:28.010 --> 06:30.120
I fucking sort him out.

06:30.130 --> 06:33.330
-You still cool for tomorrow night?
-Sure, whatever.

06:33.340 --> 06:36.320
-You make sure cause...
-I'll fucking be there, alright.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.506
You make sure, ok!

06:38.522 --> 06:41.600
Jim! I ran into
Kiwi Bob's mrs.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.980
She wants to give you
a fucking medal.

06:43.990 --> 06:47.874
That jaw shut.
She loves the peace and quiet.

06:50.130 --> 06:52.068
Hey, fellows!

06:53.648 --> 06:56.242
We got some beautiful
women in here.

06:57.572 --> 07:01.847
-Beautiful, uh? Oh, no.
-Where are you going, fellows?

07:01.862 --> 07:05.238
What are you thinking?
Jesus, fucking pooftas.

07:09.003 --> 07:11.730
-Let's go get a beer, eh?
-Yeah.

07:11.740 --> 07:15.290
-See you later, boys.
-Yeah, alright.

07:15.295 --> 07:16.295
Fuck!

07:16.300 --> 07:20.110
How's an ugly bastard like Rocket
get a goodlooking sister like that?

07:20.120 --> 07:22.373
Oi, Jimmy!

07:27.328 --> 07:30.760
-Good day, Jimmy.
-Good day, Pando. Hey, Acko.

07:30.761 --> 07:35.300
-Busy tomorrow, Jimmy?
-Not much going on.

07:35.302 --> 07:39.576
-Why, what's up?
-Got a bit of work if you wanna.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.685
-Yeah, alright. What is it?
-Come and see me tomorrow, alright.

07:43.690 --> 07:46.000
-10 o'clock.
-Alright.

07:46.010 --> 07:50.840
-You wont be late, will you mate?
-No, I'll be there. No worries.

07:50.847 --> 07:53.800
Alright then, mate.
See you then.

07:53.801 --> 07:57.050
Yeah, alright.
Well thanks, ay.

08:09.060 --> 08:13.600
-So, what did he say?
-He's got a job for me. Tomorrow.

08:14.130 --> 08:16.890
What kind of a job?
Like a job-job?

08:16.900 --> 08:19.250
I don't know. He didn't say.

08:19.300 --> 08:23.660
There you go, mate. What did I tell you?
You're on your way.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.680
What?

08:24.690 --> 08:26.755
It's your fucking break, mate!

08:26.800 --> 08:31.050
Yeah, but it's probably something small.
I mean, it's my first-

08:31.100 --> 08:34.030
Of course it's something small.
What did you expect?

08:34.039 --> 08:38.570
But mate, you're with Pando now.
So, fucking great.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.740
Yeah, I suppose.

08:41.845 --> 08:45.640
So you wanna play
with the big boys, do you?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.725
Little brother.

08:49.405 --> 08:53.290
You're back on HOT-FM and here's
the weather forecast for today.

08:53.294 --> 08:57.094
It's gonna be a hot one.
35 degrees in the shade.

08:57.095 --> 08:59.780
A light afternoon storm coming in.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.779
Til then, looks like you
gotta sweat it out.

09:02.790 --> 09:05.714
Ok, folks. Let's get
back to the rock.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.270
Busy tomorrow, Jimmy?
Well, I got some work for you.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.816
If you wanna.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.300
Oh, fuck.

09:50.095 --> 09:52.480
Hey, Jimmy!

09:52.500 --> 09:56.250
-Good morning, mrs Jones.
-That tapper's driving me mad.

09:56.260 --> 09:59.580
-Got time to look at it?
-Why don't you ask Goldie?

09:59.590 --> 10:02.470
That prick's no use for
anything. I owe him rent.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.920
Ok, don't worry.
I'll fix it for you.

10:04.930 --> 10:06.600
But now I've got to
go to a meeting, ok.

10:06.610 --> 10:08.480
-Can I come back later?
-Ok, love.

10:08.490 --> 10:10.570
Alright then. Bye.

10:50.814 --> 10:52.650
Good day!

10:52.680 --> 10:55.480
Do you remember me
from last night? Jimmy.

10:55.510 --> 10:59.160
-Yeah, yeah. Alex.
-Yeah, yeah. I know.

11:00.230 --> 11:03.900
-So, you're from the country?
-Yeah, pretty much.

11:03.910 --> 11:07.040
-What's it like out there?
-I don't know.

11:07.050 --> 11:11.660
-Less buildings. More cows.
-Do you got a horse? You ride?

11:11.664 --> 11:12.715
No.

11:14.290 --> 11:18.250
-Then what do you do?
-Not much, really.

11:18.260 --> 11:23.050
Just mock around.
It's pretty boring.

11:23.060 --> 11:27.110
-So, you're like a stripclub-guy?
-Yeah, yeah.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.700
No. I'll been doing it
for a while but...

11:29.710 --> 11:33.000
...I got a new job and you
could say I'm moving on.

11:33.010 --> 11:35.920
-Yeah, what are you doing?
-I'm a...

11:35.930 --> 11:40.500
I'm working for a guy.
Doing odd jobs here and there.

11:40.550 --> 11:45.500
-That sort of thing.
-Oh, right. Like a handyman?

11:45.567 --> 11:47.210
Yeah, yeah.

11:47.220 --> 11:51.950
-How about you? Got any photos?
-No, not really.

11:53.230 --> 11:57.810
Hey, let me take one of you.
Come on, let me take one!

11:57.820 --> 12:02.120
I promise you I'm not gonna
run off with your camera.

12:09.470 --> 12:13.130
-Well, you gotta do something.
-What do you want me to do?

12:13.140 --> 12:16.100
I don't know.
Something.

12:51.836 --> 12:55.197
-Here's your camera.
-Thanks.

12:57.016 --> 13:00.110
So, when are you gonna
get them done? Developed.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.420
I don't know.
Probably just later on.

13:04.100 --> 13:09.100
-Do you want to show them to me?
-Yeah, ok.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.570
Alright, I'll call you
or something maybe.

13:12.580 --> 13:15.130
Yeah! Alright.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.100
I'll give you my number!

13:26.800 --> 13:31.140
It's a tripple way score.
So, what do we got here?

13:31.150 --> 13:35.200
2, 1O, 2O, 27.

13:35.300 --> 13:38.000
That's...81.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.250
And I used all my letters.
It makes 131.

13:43.804 --> 13:45.595
Fuck.

13:48.006 --> 13:51.469
Where's that fucking Jimmy?
Wasn't he supposed to be here by now?

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
-Did you get held up, mate?
-Yeah, sorry.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.600
So, what's you
been doing?

14:16.610 --> 14:19.600
You did a nice job
on Kiwi Bob.

14:19.622 --> 14:22.190
Dropped him with an
upper cutter, I hear.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.790
Yeah. I'd seen him
leaving himself open to it...

14:24.800 --> 14:27.600
...so I thought I get in there
and give it a go.

14:27.610 --> 14:30.440
A nice little effort.
Kiwi Bob's no fucking softy.

14:30.460 --> 14:34.450
-Wally cleaned up on that, didn't you Wall?
-Yeah, two grand.

14:34.460 --> 14:37.520
We got the dopey bastard
to do a job for us.

14:37.530 --> 14:40.230
I sent him down
to Wollongong.

14:40.235 --> 14:43.590
To boot a load car radios
to drop on some wog down there.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.650
The wog's at the back
laying a turd.

14:46.660 --> 14:48.770
Bob thinks he's not there,
stupid prick.

14:48.780 --> 14:51.390
Turns around,
drives all the way home.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.590
Deal's blown. I'm left with
4O fucking car radios.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.120
Don't need a car radio,
do you mate?

14:58.148 --> 15:00.236
No, I don't have a car.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.990
Fair enough.

15:06.008 --> 15:10.220
-Like working with your hands, do you?
-Yeah, I'm good with my hands.

15:10.230 --> 15:14.150
I was wondering if you want
to do a bit of work. 5OO bucks.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.720
-5OO?
-Not enough for you?

15:17.730 --> 15:20.740
No, that's five...
That's great.

15:20.750 --> 15:23.880
Good. I want you to
go down Bondi.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.030
See a chick
called Sharon.

15:26.039 --> 15:28.810
-Drop a big pile of cash on her.
-How much?

15:28.820 --> 15:31.400
-1O grand.
-What's it for?

15:35.080 --> 15:40.079
What's it for? It's not yours
to be asking that, mate.

15:40.080 --> 15:43.962
Yeah, right. I didn't mean it.
I shouldn't have said anything.

15:43.980 --> 15:46.490
You just go down to Bondi.
You drop cash on this chick.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.510
-Then you bring the car back.
-Yeah. No worries.

15:49.520 --> 15:54.000
You got your keys, mate?
Give him your fucking keys.

15:54.002 --> 15:56.414
He's not taking
my fucking car.

15:56.573 --> 15:59.750
It's only gonna take 20 minutes.
He needs a car. Give the fucking keys.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.740
I just got the gearbox done.

16:01.750 --> 16:05.990
Good, it means it fucking works.
Now give him the keys.

16:13.269 --> 16:17.628
Put one ding in that car and you
know what will happen, don't you?

16:17.629 --> 16:19.398
He's not gonna
ding your car.

16:19.403 --> 16:22.616
-Are you, Jimmy?
-No, I wont.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.939
Here's the address.

16:30.233 --> 16:34.970
Gee, I thought 10 grand
would be a lot heavier than this.

16:36.012 --> 16:39.210
You're gonna be alright with this,
aren't you Jimmy?

16:39.220 --> 16:41.310
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna be fine.

16:41.320 --> 16:44.217
That's a shock, mate.
Off you go.

16:51.017 --> 16:52.575
Your go.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.050
That ship must have
come back in last night.

17:10.069 --> 17:13.329
You know, blackfellas used to
go fishing and stuff round here.

17:13.338 --> 17:16.000
-What are you talking about?
-All that used to be bush.

17:16.010 --> 17:18.670
Probably right here, used to be
a camp for blackfellas.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.710
-What happend to them?
-Died of colds.

17:21.720 --> 17:25.400
Whitefellas came here
and gave them colds.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.670
Since the blackfellas
never had colds before...

17:27.680 --> 17:31.000
...they just died of colds.
-Bullshit.

17:31.020 --> 17:34.850
It's true. Murphy told me.
He used to be history teacher.

17:34.860 --> 17:37.220
How can he be a dero
and a history teacher?

17:37.230 --> 17:38.860
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

17:38.880 --> 17:43.693
-You fucking little shit!
-What are you doing?

17:43.750 --> 17:46.455
Fucking Johnny saw you
fucking take my wallet.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.119
Where the fuck is it?

17:48.226 --> 17:49.430
I'll stick you!

17:49.440 --> 17:53.672
-Fuck you!
-Fucker, let him go!

18:05.533 --> 18:09.214
You two are
fucking dead!

18:09.316 --> 18:11.500
Nah, not you, sir.

20:49.517 --> 20:53.328
Don't think anyone's home, mate.

20:59.583 --> 21:00.857
Shit.

21:06.712 --> 21:09.250
It's ok, I should be back.

21:09.773 --> 21:12.628
Just gonna kill some time.

22:29.540 --> 22:34.290
Sometimes small things can
magnify themselves...

22:34.300 --> 22:37.337
...into big things.

22:38.906 --> 22:41.880
The flap of a butterfly wing...

22:41.890 --> 22:45.678
...can turn itself into a
raging tornado.

22:46.091 --> 22:49.950
A tiny little ripple
can end up as a...

22:49.960 --> 22:52.250
...devastating
tidal wave.

22:52.260 --> 22:56.664
Thieves go to the beach too.
Keep your belongings safe.

22:57.101 --> 22:59.620
One careless decision...

22:59.630 --> 23:04.634
...can effect the way the rest
of your life will unfold.

23:14.663 --> 23:18.190
The trick is
to think very hard...

23:18.200 --> 23:20.998
...before you take
the highroad...

23:21.005 --> 23:23.947
...or the low road.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.810
Because the wrong choice...

23:28.820 --> 23:31.476
...can really
fuck you up...

23:31.620 --> 23:34.565
...big time.

24:04.529 --> 24:07.570
Did you see someone
go through my stuff?

24:07.576 --> 24:09.730
Someone stole my fucking stuff!
Did you see?

24:09.740 --> 24:12.740
No, I didn't see anything.

24:18.859 --> 24:19.923
Shit!

24:23.879 --> 24:25.960
Fuck. Fuck.

24:38.528 --> 24:40.328
FUCK!

24:50.056 --> 24:52.942
-Would you look at that.
-D.

24:53.397 --> 24:56.020
Shit, Jimmy.
What happend?

24:56.030 --> 24:58.585
Maybe I should go and talk to him.
He probably understand.

24:58.590 --> 24:59.850
Are you out of your head?
He'll kill you.

24:59.860 --> 25:02.820
-He wont kill me, D.
-There are no two ways about this.

25:02.825 --> 25:05.915
If you dont find the 10 grand,
he'll kill you.

25:05.925 --> 25:08.140
Rhett Slater was done
for 800 bucks.

25:08.150 --> 25:11.700
They cut his head off.
You're no problem.

25:11.710 --> 25:16.800
We've got to take you out of here.
I'll have to take you to mum's.

25:16.825 --> 25:20.970
I don't even know why you want
to do this bullshit for Pando.

25:20.980 --> 25:23.000
He's a bad man.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.639
No, Pando is a good bloke.

25:41.714 --> 25:43.920
We got to put this
somewhere.

25:43.930 --> 25:46.940
Maybe stick it round the corner
in one of those backstreets.

25:46.945 --> 25:49.760
-Has it got an alarm?
-Yeah. A stearing wheel too.

25:49.766 --> 25:53.650
-It will be perfectly safe then.
-Them locks are so easy to break.

25:53.658 --> 25:57.289
Jimmy, just park the car
and don't talk to me.

25:58.355 --> 26:03.320
Back to 2HOT. Tomorrow is the big day
when one lucky listener...

26:03.330 --> 26:07.210
...will recieve 10 000 dollars cash.
That's right, folks.

26:07.214 --> 26:10.938
All you have to do is pick yourself up
a 2HOT to handle bumpersticker.

26:10.939 --> 26:12.740
The spot team will be up
and about the streets.

26:12.749 --> 26:16.470
So keep listening tomorrow
between 9 and 12.

26:16.475 --> 26:21.472
-Have you one of those stickers, D?
-No, Jimmy. I don't.

26:24.504 --> 26:27.471
-Hi, mom!
-Good day, mrs Fletcher.

26:28.569 --> 26:33.381
Just doing some work, mum.
Jimmy is in the shit again.

26:36.801 --> 26:41.200
Good day, Acko. It's Jimmy.
Can I talk to Pando?

26:41.211 --> 26:44.270
Yeah, I've got your car here.

26:44.281 --> 26:47.270
No, I can't say where I am.

26:47.279 --> 26:51.280
Look, can I please
speak to Pando?

26:51.293 --> 26:54.935
Pando. Yeah, I'm at
a friends place.

26:55.031 --> 26:57.265
No, I can't say where I am.

26:57.266 --> 27:00.510
No, no. I went down
to the flat and I knocked...

27:00.516 --> 27:03.590
...but there was
no answering.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.940
No, I haven't got it.

27:05.946 --> 27:08.874
Well, someone ripped it off.

27:08.875 --> 27:11.330
I went down to the beach...

27:11.335 --> 27:16.330
...to wait for her to come back
and I went for a swim... A swim.

27:17.557 --> 27:22.553
Well, someone ripped it off
when I was in the water.

27:22.558 --> 27:26.371
-Get over here!
-I got to go.

28:00.451 --> 28:01.749
Cactus.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.550
So I get old Jack
to have a look.

28:04.560 --> 28:07.650
And he swears to God.
A heart attack.

28:07.655 --> 28:11.960
What's going on?
I can't fucking believe that a...

28:11.965 --> 28:15.510
...35 year old women
can die of natural causes.

28:15.518 --> 28:17.550
You'll be surprised, Pando.

28:17.556 --> 28:20.520
Heart disease is biggest
killer in Australians...

28:20.530 --> 28:23.230
...over the age of 30.
-Is that true?

28:23.240 --> 28:26.495
That's what they say.

28:27.559 --> 28:30.360
Hallo? Hi, doll.

28:30.375 --> 28:34.410
No, one of those days.
Having a bloody crisis.

28:34.420 --> 28:36.260
One of the new guys.

28:36.270 --> 28:39.450
First day on the job and
he rips me off 10 grand.

28:39.460 --> 28:42.790
Yeah, we gonna have to
find the cunt and do him.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.580
I could be here all bloody day.

28:45.590 --> 28:47.179
Yeah, I know. Put him on.

28:47.180 --> 28:49.129
Do you want me to
find the cunt or what?

28:49.130 --> 28:52.480
You better make some inquiries.
See his hiding.

28:52.485 --> 28:56.120
Hallo, matey.
How are you? Did you?

28:56.125 --> 29:00.580
The origami show, is it?
I tell you what. Be a good boy and...

29:00.590 --> 29:03.980
...when I come home, I'll help you
with your origami.

29:03.990 --> 29:08.574
Ask mummy for some paper.
It's in the kitchen. Ask mummy.

29:08.575 --> 29:11.658
Alright, I'll see you
when I come home later.

29:11.659 --> 29:14.873
Bye, son. Bye.

29:18.672 --> 29:20.609
Kids.

29:32.188 --> 29:35.050
-Where did you get the clothes?
-What?

29:35.060 --> 29:37.890
-Where did you get the clothes?
-My auntie.

29:37.897 --> 29:41.300
-What auntie?
-She's part of the royal family.

29:41.306 --> 29:42.492
Bullshit!

29:42.749 --> 29:44.870
You want a hundred bucks?

29:44.876 --> 29:48.590
Give us a hundred. Joys.

29:52.620 --> 29:56.400
Your auntie really
in the royal family?

30:00.801 --> 30:04.314
-What have you done?
-Nothing.

30:04.549 --> 30:06.910
-You're going out?
-Yeah.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.360
-Where are you going?
-Just taking photos.

30:10.370 --> 30:12.710
You gonna be back
later tonight?

30:12.720 --> 30:15.155
Yeah. Why?

30:16.368 --> 30:18.264
No reason.

30:24.094 --> 30:27.270
-I got to do a job, D.
-Bloody hell.

30:27.279 --> 30:29.350
How else am I
gonna get 10 grand?

30:29.360 --> 30:31.430
You never pulled a job before.

30:31.435 --> 30:35.130
Look, D. Can you get me
in on something?

30:35.139 --> 30:40.120
Jimmy! This isn't play school.
We're talking about robbing a bank.

30:40.125 --> 30:41.899
Yeah, I know.

30:42.868 --> 30:44.570
Ok, Jimmy.

30:44.573 --> 30:47.347
I've never
told you this before.

30:47.351 --> 30:49.810
The day your
brother disappeared...

30:49.815 --> 30:52.454
...he was in this
really weird mood.

30:52.459 --> 30:55.750
He said he was in some type of shit.
He didn't tell me what it was...

30:55.755 --> 31:00.300
...but I just knew he's done
something really bad.

31:00.325 --> 31:05.320
He made me promise that I'd
keep you out of all this shit, Jimmy.

31:07.773 --> 31:10.800
Got no choice, D.

31:29.386 --> 31:31.760
Is Bill here?

31:31.766 --> 31:35.163
-Yeah, who the fuck are you?
-I'm a mate of Colin.

31:35.164 --> 31:39.803
He said I should talk to Bill
about selling my car.

31:40.052 --> 31:44.706
Hang on for a second.
I'll see if he wants to have a look.

31:53.374 --> 31:55.120
Hey, Bill!

31:55.320 --> 31:59.994
It's a cunt in here who just
knicked Acko's car.

32:23.250 --> 32:27.104
Good day. Is Acko there?

32:27.105 --> 32:28.466
It's Bill.

32:49.039 --> 32:53.270
You should've seen him. He had his
blood coming out of his mouth and stuff.

32:53.276 --> 32:55.380
And Johnny he's
done some martial arts.

32:55.384 --> 32:58.820
He's kicking him and punching him.
He was really killing him and he was-

33:15.742 --> 33:17.585
Shit!

33:28.827 --> 33:31.437
Jesus Christ, Acko.

33:34.568 --> 33:37.679
Back in the fucking car, Wally.

35:02.557 --> 35:06.000
Sorry to plant the little
buggers on you like this.

35:06.009 --> 35:09.350
Got my sister's kids here,
so couple of extra's no problem.

35:09.357 --> 35:13.370
Nolin had to work,
so I'm stuck with them tonight.

35:13.375 --> 35:17.580
-So, do you know Pando?
-Not personally but know who he is.

35:17.586 --> 35:21.910
Did some work with that crowd a few
years back, but wouldn't now then.

35:21.913 --> 35:24.470
-Why not?
-Pando is a fucking dipshit.

35:24.478 --> 35:28.363
-I've heard bad stories about him.
-He's ok once you get to know him.

35:28.364 --> 35:31.440
-Jimmy, the guy's trying to kill you.
-Yeah, I know but...

35:31.446 --> 35:35.430
-Anyway. You know how to shoot?
-Yeah, I can shoot.

35:35.439 --> 35:37.740
-You're trained up?
-Yeah, mainly boxing.

35:37.745 --> 35:39.930
Good. Crowd is
a piece of cake.

35:39.934 --> 35:42.280
You'll have to take the
security guard, but its's easy.

35:42.287 --> 35:44.470
They're usually useless, fat pricks.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.620
-What do we got, D?
-Hopeless, yeah. Useless, fat buggers.

35:47.629 --> 35:50.768
They're always fat. Anyway,
gun to their throat.

35:50.770 --> 35:54.350
Keep him looking up. That way he
won't see when you get his gun.

35:54.360 --> 35:57.520
Don't worry about it too much.
I'll help you out there.

35:57.530 --> 36:01.310
You hold the fucker's back
and I go over the canner, ok?

36:01.315 --> 36:02.515
Righto.

36:02.520 --> 36:05.400
Every now and then you'll
come across a smart-ass.

36:05.406 --> 36:09.540
The trick is do it quick on him.
Built the Christ out of the bugger.

36:09.546 --> 36:13.450
You don't want to kill him but
a good fuck with the shotie.

36:13.458 --> 36:15.380
You give me a shotie?

36:15.395 --> 36:19.710
-Yeah, why? You don't like shot-guns?
-No. Shotie's alright.

36:19.714 --> 36:22.750
-Yeah, shoties are good, man.
-Give me that truck!

36:22.755 --> 36:25.600
Kelv, what's going on
in there, mate?

36:25.610 --> 36:27.720
Be a good boy and
share your toys.

36:27.729 --> 36:31.720
-Dad, he took my truck!
-Play with your raygun.

36:37.848 --> 36:40.320
What were we saying?

36:40.327 --> 36:41.986
Shot-guns.

36:41.990 --> 36:43.310
Oh, yeah.

36:43.322 --> 36:46.800
Fire off a shot if you like.
It's always good for crowd work.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.710
Remember old Blue? He always
used to fire off a cartridge.

36:49.717 --> 36:54.270
He used to shoot the cameras.
It was pretty funny.

36:54.283 --> 36:56.251
Here we go!

36:56.823 --> 36:58.960
Thanks a lot, mrs Fletcher.

36:59.245 --> 37:03.400
-Another cup of tea, Craig?
-Thanks very much, mrs Fletcher.

37:06.075 --> 37:09.840
Hey! What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

37:09.845 --> 37:11.440
I was just taking a photo.

37:11.449 --> 37:13.727
Why the fuck do you want to
take my photo for?

37:13.737 --> 37:17.909
Sorry. I just wanted to
take your photo. I'm sorry.

37:17.910 --> 37:21.388
You're such a
good looking bastard.

37:21.389 --> 37:24.487
Well, that's different.

37:27.285 --> 37:29.710
Righty. I've got quite a few.

37:29.720 --> 37:33.320
But I think we can narrow it down
to these three here.

37:33.325 --> 37:36.170
This is the Commonwealth
Bank in Rooty Hill.

37:36.173 --> 37:39.840
Quite a good bank. There's
no screens. Fat guard.

37:39.845 --> 37:42.745
A pretty easy bank but
there's not a lot of cash there.

37:42.750 --> 37:46.875
The main branch is a couple of case
down the road. More cash there.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.600
-What's this one?
-That's my personal peak.

37:49.610 --> 37:52.650
The guard is a young bloke
but he's thick as shit and fat.

37:52.655 --> 37:56.305
The good thing about that one is that
they look after bread factory payroll.

37:56.309 --> 37:58.400
They get loaded
on thursdays.

37:58.405 --> 38:01.770
It's a bit of a drive out there
but it's probably worth it.

38:01.775 --> 38:03.580
-Screens?
-No.

38:03.590 --> 38:05.520
Looks like a beauty.

38:05.530 --> 38:09.900
-How much reckon they got there?
-I don't know. Could be a hundred.

38:09.905 --> 38:12.860
That would be nice.
What do you reckon, Jimmy?

38:12.870 --> 38:16.220
-Yeah, sounds pretty good.
-That's the one then.

38:16.225 --> 38:18.590
-What are we riding in, Craig?
-Commodores.

38:18.595 --> 38:23.040
-Today's wednesday. Tomorrow then?
-Yeah, if that suits you blokes.

38:23.045 --> 38:24.185
Yeah, suits me.

38:24.190 --> 38:26.380
Shit! I'll have
the kids again.

38:26.385 --> 38:28.500
Wozz, you silly bugger.
I'll look after them.

38:28.510 --> 38:31.080
Thanks, D. You're getting
another car then, Craig?

38:31.090 --> 38:34.400
Yeah, I can do that. I might go
for a drive and check it out.

38:34.410 --> 38:37.625
Alrighty then. This should be fun.
Are you excited, Jimmy?

38:37.630 --> 38:39.130
Yeah, I guess.

38:39.135 --> 38:42.075
I'll better piss off home. Get some
dinner to those bloody kids of mine.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.160
I'll see you all tomorrow.

38:44.192 --> 38:47.910
Jesus Christ. They'll laugh
on our bloody heads off.

38:47.915 --> 38:51.280
This is gonna be
a fucking ripper.

38:59.024 --> 39:01.569
Did you see anything?

39:02.851 --> 39:05.537
Did you see the vehicle?

39:06.015 --> 39:08.849
Did you see the
young lad get hit?

39:12.059 --> 39:13.670
Have you seen Ron?

39:13.680 --> 39:17.500
-What do you want him for?
-I just fucking want him!

39:17.510 --> 39:20.990
-Have you seen him?
-I think he's at Phil's.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.280
-What?
-Is Ron here?

39:31.290 --> 39:34.680
-What do you want him for?
-I just want to talk to him.

39:34.690 --> 39:37.542
-Fuck off.
-Wait.

39:43.103 --> 39:45.297
Alright. Come on.

39:47.759 --> 39:50.570
God day, Wall.
How're you going?

39:50.575 --> 39:53.160
-Have you seen Jimmy?
-Not since last night.

39:53.170 --> 39:56.150
-Thought he was with you fellows.
-You've heard nothing from him?

39:56.155 --> 39:59.600
-No. What's happend?
-Pando is keen to catch up with him.

39:59.610 --> 40:04.060
-Fuck! Jimmy bullshitted you did he?
-Just let us know if you hear anything.

40:04.070 --> 40:06.533
Pando would be
happy for any info.

40:06.771 --> 40:09.450
No, I don't know
nothing, mate.

40:09.455 --> 40:11.900
Have you checked his place?

41:08.050 --> 41:12.385
-Hi! Alex. How are you, love?
-I'm alright.

41:12.395 --> 41:15.020
-Is Rocket here?
-No, he's not back yet.

41:15.030 --> 41:18.940
-But he said it wont be long.
-Alright.

41:19.650 --> 41:24.640
Mind if I come in and wait for him?
Is that alright?

41:34.200 --> 41:38.680
-So, how's your first time here?
-It was alright.

41:38.690 --> 41:41.810
Yeah. Good looking girl like you
should have no probs.

41:41.820 --> 41:45.100
The queen of the town
before too long.

41:45.156 --> 41:47.620
Are you going out tonight?

41:47.625 --> 41:49.960
I don't know. Probably.

41:49.961 --> 41:52.016
Where are you going?

41:52.116 --> 41:54.170
I'm not sure yet.

41:54.180 --> 41:58.430
Alright. Like the pictures, do you?

41:58.440 --> 42:00.490
I thought all girls
like the pictures.

42:00.500 --> 42:03.158
Tom Cruise.
I bet you like him, ay?

42:03.159 --> 42:06.290
Brad Pitt?
What about him?

42:06.750 --> 42:10.590
-Guess there aren't the flicks at you?
-No, we've got them.

42:10.610 --> 42:14.790
-Gee, you go out much?
-A bit.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.490
Fuck!

42:16.582 --> 42:19.461
Maybe we should get
a flick sometime?

42:19.511 --> 42:23.181
What about tonight?
We can catch a flick tonight.

42:23.995 --> 42:26.993
I'm not sure.

42:28.250 --> 42:30.250
Hallo!

42:30.260 --> 42:32.220
-Alex?
-Yeah.

42:32.230 --> 42:36.100
-Hi! It's me, Jimmy.
-Hi. How are you?

42:36.102 --> 42:39.520
-Yeah, good. How are you?
-I'm alright.

42:39.525 --> 42:41.320
-What are you doing?
-Not much.

42:41.328 --> 42:43.900
I just thought I give you a call, you know.
See what you're doing.

42:43.910 --> 42:46.480
I didn't know if you
gonna call or not.

42:46.485 --> 42:49.670
-So what are you doing tonight?
-I don't know.

42:49.680 --> 42:52.440
-What are you up to?
-I don't know.

42:52.448 --> 42:56.700
I was eager to go to China Town.
Have you ever been there?

42:56.705 --> 42:58.140
Yeah, I've been there.

42:58.145 --> 43:02.040
I was thinking about going down there
for a while and checking it out.

43:02.049 --> 43:06.749
I was wondering if you want to
meet me or something. If you want to.

43:06.760 --> 43:09.427
I don't know if I can.

43:09.622 --> 43:12.018
Oh, ok.

43:12.218 --> 43:16.580
No, it's not that I don't
want to or anything but...

43:16.586 --> 43:19.093
It's just that I've...

43:23.255 --> 43:27.220
Well, there's a pub down
near China Town.

43:27.229 --> 43:29.710
It's called the Star Hotel.

43:29.716 --> 43:34.440
-On Goulburn Street.
-The Star Hotel.

43:34.747 --> 43:37.856
-I can meet you there, if you want.
-Alright.

43:37.906 --> 43:42.910
-Ok, I'll see you there.
-I'll see you there. Bye, Jimmy.

43:45.077 --> 43:48.527
-You're going out somewhere, are you?
-Yes.

43:58.428 --> 44:02.360
D, I was just thinking about
popping out for a while.

44:02.364 --> 44:06.040
What? Why are you
wearing those clothes?

44:06.044 --> 44:08.440
I was gonna go see
mum and Mal.

44:08.449 --> 44:11.910
What are you talking about?
You haven't seen them in five years.

44:11.911 --> 44:15.890
I was speaking to mum on the phone
and I promised go around and see her.

44:15.895 --> 44:17.892
It will only be an hour or two.

44:17.902 --> 44:19.990
-Jimmy, are you out of your head?
-I'll be fine, D.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.510
Go on, love.
Go and see your mum.

44:22.518 --> 44:26.615
Jesus Christ, Jimmy.
Are you completely insane?

44:26.620 --> 44:29.490
-It will be a couple of hours, alright.
-Pando is bloody looking for you!

44:29.495 --> 44:31.770
You know what will happen
when he finds you, don't you?

44:31.774 --> 44:35.020
-I'll be fine, alright.
-Let him go, D.

44:35.029 --> 44:38.020
-Go and see your mother, Jimmy.
-Mum!

44:38.025 --> 44:40.240
I'll see you later, mrs Fletcher.
Thanks for your hospitality.

44:40.244 --> 44:43.680
Been a pleasure, Jimmy.
I'll leave the light on for you, love.

44:43.690 --> 44:44.879
SHIT!

44:50.065 --> 44:51.236
Shit.

46:34.709 --> 46:37.210
-Hey.
-Hallo.

46:37.215 --> 46:39.820
-How are you?
-Not bad.

46:39.830 --> 46:42.430
-So, how did it go today?
-It was alright.

46:42.437 --> 46:45.170
Had a look around.
Took some photos.

46:45.179 --> 46:47.985
-Do you wanna see them?
-Yeah, yeah.

46:53.053 --> 46:57.205
-You look good in photos.
-But not in real life though, ay?

46:57.217 --> 47:01.205
-This is one of me. Bad.
-Hey, hang on.

47:02.086 --> 47:04.571
That's alright.

47:04.753 --> 47:07.937
You can have it if you want.

47:09.649 --> 47:12.799
Here's another one of you.

47:15.388 --> 47:18.569
I didn't know
you took that one.

47:18.725 --> 47:21.328
Who's the guy in the car?

47:21.505 --> 47:25.401
-That's Pando.
-Pando?

47:25.657 --> 47:28.541
Sounds like a teddybear.

47:30.292 --> 47:33.055
So, who is he?

47:34.648 --> 47:38.476
Pando is a guy...
He's a big guy in the cross.

47:38.709 --> 47:41.070
Friend of yours?

47:41.090 --> 47:43.600
Well, no. Not exactly.

47:43.610 --> 47:46.094
Is he an asshole?

47:47.672 --> 47:51.836
No, Pando is a good bloke. He...

47:54.273 --> 47:58.233
Yeah well, I guess
he is an asshole.

47:58.254 --> 48:01.160
See, in the cross...

48:01.170 --> 48:03.590
...they all wants to be
mates with Pando.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.573
If you're in with Pando,
you're set.

48:05.575 --> 48:09.515
When Pando comes up to me
and he ask me if I want to do a job for him,

48:09.550 --> 48:12.138
I'm thinking: Great!

48:12.460 --> 48:15.269
But it's all bullshit.

48:17.448 --> 48:22.092
What did you wanna be
when you were a little kid?

48:22.123 --> 48:25.280
I don't know.
Some shit kicking thing.

48:25.290 --> 48:28.800
No, what did you
really wanna be?

48:28.809 --> 48:33.028
I guess I just wanted to do
something with my hands.

48:33.056 --> 48:36.951
Not like fighting. I don't wanna
be a fighter or anything but...

48:37.079 --> 48:39.820
...you know, just fixing things.

48:39.828 --> 48:43.380
Making things. You know,
that sort of stuff.

48:43.385 --> 48:47.280
You should talk to my uncle.
He's a boatbuilder in the north coast.

48:47.289 --> 48:50.280
He's been looking to take someone on.
Like an apprentice or something like that.

48:50.284 --> 48:54.600
-What is it?
-He just learn how to make boats.

48:54.604 --> 48:58.700
-Boats? Making boats?
-Yeah.

48:58.710 --> 49:03.710
-That would be alright, ay?
-Better than hang around assholes.

49:03.715 --> 49:05.345
Yeah!

49:24.103 --> 49:26.590
Good day, it's Les.

49:26.600 --> 49:29.600
Les Watson.
Yeah, that's alright.

49:29.608 --> 49:33.550
-Got some information.
-What?

49:33.560 --> 49:36.310
Where? Where?

49:44.862 --> 49:48.514
To this end, mate.
That's it.

49:57.110 --> 49:59.885
Yes, soft folds.
Not hard, mate.

49:59.985 --> 50:02.572
That's good, boy.

50:05.827 --> 50:09.370
-Morris! Phone.
-Oh, shit.

50:09.375 --> 50:13.340
You keep making the
pterodactyl, mate.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.770
Hallo.

50:17.790 --> 50:20.680
Yeah? Fucking where?

50:20.686 --> 50:24.615
Rightyo, then.
Where is Acko?

50:25.129 --> 50:27.940
Ok, see you there.

50:29.420 --> 50:34.340
-Look, dad.
-That's a beauty, Jake.

50:34.346 --> 50:38.906
That's a lovely looking
pterodactyl.

50:40.100 --> 50:44.500
"Next time we make dog."
-Yeah, dog!

50:44.550 --> 50:49.543
-Nice dog.
-He's the same as my old dog.

50:51.706 --> 50:55.180
When do you reckon you'll be able
to give your uncle a call?

50:55.190 --> 50:58.230
I don't know. Tomorrow?

50:58.240 --> 51:00.450
How about tonight?

51:00.459 --> 51:04.920
I don't have the number with me.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.884
Why? You're kinda keen to
get out of town or something?

51:09.919 --> 51:12.741
I know this bloke. It's Koki.

51:12.744 --> 51:15.583
Bloody Les in the
background there.

51:15.617 --> 51:17.450
I don't like him.
He's disgusting.

51:17.460 --> 51:22.380
He was at my place. Tried to crack
onto me. Scratching his balls.

51:22.390 --> 51:24.770
I was glad you rang when you did.

51:24.775 --> 51:27.160
So, he was there when
I was talking to you?

51:27.170 --> 51:29.365
Yeah, just sitting and
staring at me.

51:29.375 --> 51:32.513
-And what did he do?
-Nothing.

51:32.533 --> 51:37.400
But I think he was pissed off when
he knew I was going out with you.

51:37.455 --> 51:39.349
Oh, shit!

51:49.053 --> 51:51.165
Check the dunnys!

52:08.170 --> 52:10.790
-He's not in there.
-FUCK!

52:11.654 --> 52:14.000
Hallo? What?

52:14.100 --> 52:18.215
-What's the matter, Jimmy?
-Nothing.

52:18.450 --> 52:22.766
He's around the corner
up ahead of me. Yeah, I will.

52:22.768 --> 52:27.000
Fuck, the batteries
are gone. I don't know.

52:27.050 --> 52:30.280
Yeah, where the fuck would
you've been without me?

52:30.300 --> 52:34.418
Hey, hallo? Hallo!
FUCK! FUCK!

52:35.522 --> 52:37.480
Have you been
on the monorail?

52:37.500 --> 52:41.700
-No.
-Let's go for a ride. Come on!

52:59.100 --> 53:00.470
Shit.

53:07.845 --> 53:09.230
Fuck!

53:10.499 --> 53:11.720
Fuck!

53:15.580 --> 53:19.048
Hey man,
what are you doing?

53:44.669 --> 53:47.539
What's happened, Jimmy?

53:50.641 --> 53:54.660
You know how I was
telling you about Pando?

53:57.881 --> 54:00.018
He's after me.

54:00.098 --> 54:04.259
I did a job for him. I stuffed
it up and he's after me.

54:04.408 --> 54:05.826
Shit.

54:08.007 --> 54:09.777
I'm sorry.

54:11.164 --> 54:12.418
Why?

54:13.022 --> 54:17.929
You know, it's gonna be alright.
I'm gonna be fine.

54:18.451 --> 54:22.426
I just didn't want to get you
messed up in all this shit.

54:24.005 --> 54:28.969
Why don't you just go away?
Just go up north tonight.

54:29.298 --> 54:33.320
Get a night train
and get out of here.

54:33.350 --> 54:37.750
-I don't know.
-What's stopping you?

54:42.260 --> 54:45.389
Do you wanna come with me?

56:41.612 --> 56:45.518
Get him. Get him up!
Come on!

56:47.054 --> 56:49.285
HELP ME!

56:49.320 --> 56:53.827
Get him in. Come on!
Get him in!

57:18.115 --> 57:20.970
You're Rocket's little sister,
aren't you?

57:20.980 --> 57:23.350
We just need to talk to
Jimmy about a few things.

57:23.360 --> 57:26.100
So, you best piss off home.

57:26.150 --> 57:28.874
Do you got enough for a taxi?

57:33.030 --> 57:36.683
20 dollars should see
you home alright.

57:38.980 --> 57:43.169
You get a cab up the road there.

57:59.869 --> 58:02.257
You got my keys, Jimmy?

58:02.300 --> 58:05.300
It's quarter past the hour...

58:05.330 --> 58:07.920
...and the storm is closing in.

58:07.930 --> 58:09.510
So snuggle down...

58:09.520 --> 58:12.500
...and get very, very cosy
and warm because...

58:12.540 --> 58:17.400
...this beautiful song is for all
the lovers throughout the world.

58:18.970 --> 58:20.940
I love this song.

58:21.380 --> 58:25.550
"You say this sky...

58:27.000 --> 58:32.480
...this sky's in love with you."

58:35.000 --> 58:37.990
Jesus Christ, Pando!
You can't do this to me!

58:38.000 --> 58:41.530
I've been 100% fair to you!

58:41.540 --> 58:44.100
Have I ever bullshitted you, have I?

58:44.102 --> 58:46.220
-I don't know, Jimmy.
-I haven't.

58:46.230 --> 58:49.280
I've never bullshitted you.
Please Pando...

58:49.300 --> 58:52.400
-I don't wanna fucking die.
-Jesus fucking Christ!

58:52.410 --> 58:55.170
I'm doing a job tomorrow.
I'm gonna get your fucking money back.

58:55.180 --> 58:59.300
You've never done a job in your fucking
life. You wouldn't know where to start.

58:59.335 --> 59:02.740
A friend, Deirdre. You know
Crusher Fletcher's daughter?

59:02.750 --> 59:06.000
-Yeah.
-She's organized a job for me.

59:06.020 --> 59:09.980
-I'm gonna get your fucking money.
-Can't you see this from my point of view?

59:09.990 --> 59:13.060
You can tell me you're
the king of fucking Sweden.

59:13.068 --> 59:15.220
I let one cunt off once.
What was his name?

59:15.230 --> 59:17.350
-Robo.
-Yeah, Robo.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.760
I let this cunt off. He goes straight
to the police. I couldn't believe it.

59:19.770 --> 59:23.480
What had I done to deserve this?
Lucky for me he went to Phil Rogers.

59:23.490 --> 59:27.980
So we got the cunt back. But
that was a valuable fucking lesson.

59:27.990 --> 59:32.000
And I'm not gonna get burnt a second time.
You should be able to understand that.

59:32.020 --> 59:35.840
-I swear on my mother's fucking grave!
-Shut the fucking mouth!

59:40.500 --> 59:43.610
I'm not fucking bullshitting.
I'm telling you the truth!

59:43.615 --> 59:46.040
Ring Deirdre!
We're doing this job.

59:46.050 --> 59:49.530
I'm gonna get your 10 grand back.
I'll give you 15, I promise.

59:49.540 --> 59:53.850
Just ring her, please. I'm gonna
get your fucking money back.

59:56.860 --> 59:58.580
Sorry, Jimmy.

01:00:07.766 --> 01:00:11.670
-Fucking thing.
-Give me a look at it.

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:14.742
Get the torch over here, Wall.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.120
Ouch! Fuck! Shit!

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:26.250
Fucking old, mate.
This gun's fucking filthy.

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:28.670
Jesus, look what's
happened here.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.680
The cap's fizzed out...

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:34.030
...and fused the
fucking chamber.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.070
Unbelievable.

01:00:39.306 --> 01:00:41.840
What's happened
to these bullets?

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:44.860
They're bloody rusty
or something.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.700
I accidently put them
through the wash.

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:49.760
You what?

01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:53.290
I had them in my shorts
and I washed them.

01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:56.859
Of course they're fucked if you put
them through the washing machine.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.900
No, water shouldn't
fuck them up, Pando.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.990
But they fizz like that
if they're old.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.490
How old are these?

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.120
Not that old.

01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:13.920
You loaded your gun with old bullets
you put through the fucking wash?

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:18.360
Well, righto. I shot with them
fucking bullets, didn't I?

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:22.900
You're the one who told me to put
20 rounds through Rhett Slater.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.850
-Do you got any more bullets?
-No.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.350
Shit!

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.860
-Anyone got another gun?
-Yeah.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.050
-Where is it?
-It's in the car.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:36.500
Well, fuck off and get it!

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:38.685
Fuck.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.160
-This is where we planted his brother.
-Ay?

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:49.400
Fucking Michael.
We stuck him right here.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.330
The dam wasn't here.
The dam was dry.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.980
But that's where we
stuck him. Right there.

01:01:54.989 --> 01:01:56.360
Is it?

01:01:59.331 --> 01:02:01.845
Yeah, right.
It was.

01:02:07.055 --> 01:02:08.243
Gee!

01:02:20.219 --> 01:02:22.033
Fuck. My nuts.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:45.976
Go around, that way!

01:04:01.197 --> 01:04:04.537
That torch is fucking useless.

01:04:05.805 --> 01:04:08.621
Just pissing down.

01:04:09.316 --> 01:04:11.696
Fuck this rain!

01:06:40.514 --> 01:06:43.110
You're on your own now, Jimmy.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.435
Look after yourself.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:58.270
-I don't want to.
-You got to get out of here.

01:06:58.275 --> 01:07:00.745
Pando is not the type of guy
you want to fuck with.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.750
-What are we gonna do about Jimmy?
-Forget Jimmy!

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.990
Just pack your
bloody suitcase!

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.520
-They are gonna kill him!
-Fuck him, alright!

01:07:24.227 --> 01:07:25.802
Please!

01:07:31.558 --> 01:07:33.882
Fuck. Don't you see?

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.727
Come on, woman!

01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:41.861
Fuck it! You fucked with Pando,
don't you understand?

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:17.000
Look what the fucking
cat dragged in!

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:19.899
Jesus Christ, Jimmy.
Where have you been?

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.600
I don't know.

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.560
-You look like shit!
-Yeah?

01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:32.444
Are you ok?

01:08:33.564 --> 01:08:34.712
Yeah.

01:08:36.064 --> 01:08:39.010
You're gonna be
ok for today?

01:08:40.654 --> 01:08:43.794
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:08:47.884 --> 01:08:50.868
Harry King hears about it
of one of the boys...

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:53.200
...that Phil's been fooling
around with his mrs.

01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:56.950
Everybody says: Shit, man.
You know Harry King?

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.670
He's built like a fucking brick supermarket,
he's mader than a cut snake.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.880
We're all sitting in the pub
one night and Harry walks in.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:07.600
He walks straight up to Phil.
He throws a .22 bullet on his lap.

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:09.689
He stares him straight
in the eye and says:

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:13.950
The next one's coming
a lot fucking quicker.

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:16.390
Phil is just fucking
shitting himself.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:20.800
He's out of town.
We haven't seen him since.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:38.450
Alrighty, then. Let's go, ay?
Any last questions?

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:41.830
What if we see any cops?

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.640
What do you mean?

01:09:44.649 --> 01:09:47.630
What if a cop comes on?

01:09:47.639 --> 01:09:50.029
You shoot him.

01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:55.900
Look, man. They fucking shoot you,
alright. You shoot the bastards.

01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:57.700
Are you alright?
Are you ok?

01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:00.452
Mate, just try to have
some fun with this.

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.620
-You're alright?
-Yeah.

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.994
Ok. Mask up, mate.

01:10:07.526 --> 01:10:10.349
Let's fuck this puppy!

01:10:17.601 --> 01:10:19.770
Get down on the fucking floor!

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:23.540
Everyone down!
There's a fucking hold-up!

01:10:28.299 --> 01:10:29.758
Nice.

01:10:30.955 --> 01:10:34.930
Unlock the drawer.
All of you, open the drawers!

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:38.550
Get the moneybag filled up! Come on,
move it! Get the money up!

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.400
You stay there, dickhead.
Give me the bag! Money in!

01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:47.580
Where's the fucking safe, mate?
Come on, fuck it, move!

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.250
Get on the fucking floor!
Come on, dickhead!

01:10:52.469 --> 01:10:54.533
Come on, open it!
Open it!

01:10:59.479 --> 01:11:01.950
Get down, you fucking arsehole!

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.330
Yeah, righto killer.
Settle down.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.760
Get down, asshole!

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:31.625
Oi!

01:12:20.883 --> 01:12:22.027
Shit.

01:12:33.461 --> 01:12:35.015
(What?)

01:12:37.867 --> 01:12:39.260
(What?!)

01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:51.730
-Wozza's bloody out cold. Give us a hand.
-He's what?

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:55.080
-Bloody, give us a hand!
-Fuck!

01:13:13.224 --> 01:13:14.264
Come on!

01:13:16.347 --> 01:13:18.930
What the fuck is going on?

01:13:19.858 --> 01:13:23.680
We better get out of here!
Where's Craig?

01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:25.650
Where's Craig, Jimmy?

01:13:31.035 --> 01:13:32.682
Fuck this!

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.203
We’ve got to get
another car, digger!

01:13:49.479 --> 01:13:50.554
What?

01:13:50.615 --> 01:13:54.432
The car's fucked.
We got to piss off out of here.

01:13:58.568 --> 01:14:02.677
1, 2, 3. Go! GO!

01:14:10.311 --> 01:14:13.879
Steve, I don't want to go
into that right now, mate.

01:14:15.216 --> 01:14:18.283
No, it's not a question
of that, it's just...

01:14:18.559 --> 01:14:22.591
-Give me your keys!
-No, not her! Him!

01:14:22.832 --> 01:14:25.676
Steve, I might have to
call you back, alright.

01:14:30.286 --> 01:14:33.273
-Get the fuck out!
-Ok, ok.

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:46.690
You're listening to radio 2HOT.
Time now folks for the big give away.

01:14:46.728 --> 01:14:50.480
10 000 dollars is what we're
gonna give away.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.000
Larry Pinkerton, our man
on the streets...

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.340
...is out there spotting the
2HOT to handle bumperstickers.

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:57.265
-Larry, can you hear me?
-Hallo, Ian.

01:14:57.275 --> 01:14:59.810
What a glorious summer morning
we have on our hands.

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:02.350
Yeah. Now, where are we
today, Larry?

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.012
Cruising down Parramatta Road, Hombush.

01:15:06.212 --> 01:15:11.209
We have spotted a grey Celica,
registration LAB 823.

01:15:11.359 --> 01:15:15.203
And I can see the 2HOT
to handle sticker on the bumper.

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:18.320
Ok, grey Celica LAB 823.
If you're listening,

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:20.850
...all you have to do
is wave to Larry...

01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:24.415
...and you've scored yourself
10 000 dollars cash.

01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:29.270
We're driving right next to
mr LAB, now!

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:36.360
He's seen us!
He's seen us!

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:38.590
Congratulations, mr LA-

01:15:42.122 --> 01:15:43.896
Look out for the...

01:15:45.565 --> 01:15:48.410
Okey-dokey. It looks like we've, uhh...

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.610
We've lost Larry.

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:55.610
Kelvin! I told you before, mate.
It's not a toy, alright.

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:58.149
Listen, I really got to go.

01:15:58.208 --> 01:15:59.244
Listen...

01:16:01.011 --> 01:16:03.174
I'd like to just...

01:16:03.379 --> 01:16:06.589
...propose a moment's
silence for Craig.

01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:09.127
He was a good mate.

01:16:09.128 --> 01:16:14.126
He was a bloody good driver.
He was a top mechanic.

01:16:14.517 --> 01:16:16.758
Saw him once...

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.850
...switching twin barrel
carbies butt, yeah...

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.105
...with a beer in his hand.

01:16:23.488 --> 01:16:26.630
He could do a 450 car
on a 350 donk.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:31.400
He get back in that car
in less than a day.

01:16:31.835 --> 01:16:33.219
So...

01:16:34.581 --> 01:16:37.648
...a bit of silence, ay?

01:16:49.286 --> 01:16:52.918
Christ, Kelvin!
I told you about that!

01:16:52.919 --> 01:16:56.341
Dad's got a splitting
bloody headache!

01:17:00.206 --> 01:17:01.410
Oh, shit!

01:17:04.414 --> 01:17:05.963
Jimmy!

01:17:09.948 --> 01:17:12.352
What are you doing?

01:17:29.792 --> 01:17:31.926
(Don't you fuck!)

01:17:59.018 --> 01:18:00.686
Oi, Jimmy!

01:18:43.553 --> 01:18:47.256
Watch it! I think he's got
something down his pants.

01:18:55.049 --> 01:18:57.057
He's got a gun!

01:19:07.009 --> 01:19:09.453
Fuck me dead.
Look at that!

01:19:12.356 --> 01:19:15.046
How much is there?

01:19:15.047 --> 01:19:17.028
Bloody hell.

01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:23.577
So you did it, mate.
You did your fucking job.

01:19:23.657 --> 01:19:27.274
Wasn't bullshitting after all, ay?

01:19:41.428 --> 01:19:45.440
Was that you on that
Bankstown job today?

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.680
Yeah.

01:19:48.486 --> 01:19:53.380
Jesus. My testicles are like
a pair of piklership bastard.

01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:56.393
He cracked one of my ribs,
you know Jimmy?

01:19:56.403 --> 01:19:58.600
Didn't know you could
handle yourself so well.

01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:00.155
We were pretty impressed.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.050
It was a very tidy display. Very tidy.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:07.702
Now listen, Jimmy.
I got a lot of work coming up.

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:12.725
Wally's going to Melbourne for 2 months,
so I could use another set of hands.

01:20:13.813 --> 01:20:15.607
No, thanks.

01:20:15.861 --> 01:20:18.950
I'm not talking 500 bucks a pop.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.975
I'm talking serious fucking bucks.

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:38.000
Jimmy, I...

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.980
...appreciate the trouble
you went through...

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.640
...to get my cash back but-

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.094
Pando, your queen's in
some deep shit now.

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:37.601
Shut your fucking mouth, Wally!

01:22:43.672 --> 01:22:45.822
Hey, I'll be fucked!

01:23:01.523 --> 01:23:03.594
Fuck.

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:09.890
-Is that you, Jimmy?
-How are you, mrs Jones?

01:24:09.899 --> 01:24:11.930
There's been people at your flat.

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:14.970
They've messed it all up.
I've seen them.

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:18.504
-They didn't hurt you, did they?
-No.

01:24:18.915 --> 01:24:23.902
Jimmy, I think there's
someone in there now.

01:24:40.203 --> 01:24:44.769
-Your room's a bit of a mess.
-Yeah.

01:25:02.491 --> 01:25:07.483
You're in luck. There are two seats
together in 15 B and C.

01:25:08.284 --> 01:25:09.642
Yeah, good.

01:25:10.287 --> 01:25:15.201
North coast is very popular
this time of year with school holidays.

01:25:15.955 --> 01:25:18.998
How would you like
to pay for it, sir?

01:25:19.014 --> 01:25:21.334
What do you mean?

01:25:21.336 --> 01:25:24.639
What would you like to
pay your tickets with?

01:25:24.641 --> 01:25:26.500
Money.

01:25:27.439 --> 01:25:30.144
Cash or credit card, sir?

01:25:30.779 --> 01:25:34.468
Yeah, cash. Thanks.

01:25:41.033 --> 01:25:42.147
What?

01:25:43.519 --> 01:25:46.790
What are you smiling about?

01:25:46.798 --> 01:25:50.525
Did you think you could pay
with bananas or something?

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:53.380
Yeah well, I don't know, do I.

01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:56.539
I've never been on
an aeroplane before.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.728
