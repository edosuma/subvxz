02:33.680 --> 02:35.039
Excuse me.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.287
Shithead.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.319
You shouldn't be here.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.799
I know. Ask for at
least $1,000, okay?

02:57.800 --> 03:00.799
I'll get as much
as I can. You hide.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.759
His wife took his kid
and a couple of million,

03:03.760 --> 03:05.759
and we won't get a thousand.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.279
Shut up and stay hidden.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.006
I told him I was coming alone.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.879
Hey, Mr. Crisp.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.519
How's it going?

04:07.520 --> 04:10.519
You said you had information
about my family.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.768
Yeah, yeah, I do.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.361
Well, let's have it.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.039
Well, it's going to cost you.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.719
Like $1,000?

04:25.480 --> 04:28.519
Okay, that's obviously
not my final offer.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.245
750 would be fine.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.199
I mean, more than fine.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.483
Just tell me what you have, Danny,
and I'll take good care of you.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.159
Okay.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.771
That sounds fair.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.928
I was doing a delivery for Corky last week
out of state, and I ran into your ex.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.640
How'd she look?

04:50.120 --> 04:52.084
She looked great, Mr. Crisp. Yeah.

04:52.320 --> 04:56.206
She changed her hair and stuff, but
she looked like a million dollars.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.766
In fact, she looked
like about $3 million.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.045
Did she see you?

05:03.400 --> 05:06.080
No. I was changing a tire,

05:06.480 --> 05:10.363
and suddenly, there she was across the
street, taking her kid into this school.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.599
My boy?

05:12.600 --> 05:13.759
Looked great.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.530
He looked very healthy.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.479
It's a real nice, healthy
place where they're living.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.364
It snows in winter there.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.930
Danny,

05:23.840 --> 05:25.451
where are they?

05:26.280 --> 05:28.130
At the school where I saw them...

05:29.720 --> 05:31.331
Astoria Elementary School.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.079
That's...

05:33.080 --> 05:35.965
It's in Astoria, Oregon.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.087
All right.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.399
Did you tell anyone else this?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.204
No. No way.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.962
Hey, I'm not stupid, Mr. Crisp.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.599
You're not?

06:04.280 --> 06:05.845
Danny.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.083
Danny! No!

06:08.360 --> 06:10.085
Danny!

06:11.680 --> 06:13.079
Danny!

06:13.080 --> 06:14.327
Get up!

06:16.720 --> 06:18.524
Don't you die on me!

06:19.800 --> 06:21.879
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.039
Was it Crisp?

06:23.040 --> 06:24.799
I don't know.
I didn't see anything.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.519
I was in a box over there...

06:26.520 --> 06:28.719
What are you doing?

06:28.720 --> 06:30.479
Hey, hey, hey!

06:30.480 --> 06:31.719
Stop it! Don't do that!

06:31.720 --> 06:32.999
Don't go anywhere.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.359
Let me go!

06:34.360 --> 06:36.799
No! Let me off of him!

06:36.800 --> 06:39.839
I don't like what you've done.
I really don't like it.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.519
It feels terrible, and
it looks dreadful.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.919
I'm trying my best.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.479
Maybe your best isn't good enough.

06:45.480 --> 06:46.799
I'm back.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.519
Oh, great. Well, that was fast.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.324
It was easy.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.319
I have some great, exciting,
wonderful news, Mother.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.679
Oh, you always exaggerate, Cullen.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.959
Everything is always
great, terrific.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.919
So, what's so great?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.199
I just found out where
they're hiding.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.210
Are you serious?
You really know where he is?

07:05.680 --> 07:07.370
Manicure, Mr. Crisp?

07:07.480 --> 07:10.399
Oh, how could I say no to you?

07:10.400 --> 07:11.639
Tell me.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.080
What's happened?

07:13.360 --> 07:15.679
Just let me handle
this myself, Mother.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.439
I know what I'm doing.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.244
Everything is under control.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.679
It's all right. I'm
a police officer.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.479
Crisp, you're under arrest.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.079
Put your hands on
your head and get up!

07:34.080 --> 07:35.519
Kimble, not again!

07:35.520 --> 07:36.719
Your hands!

07:36.720 --> 07:39.639
They're up. When will
you leave me alone?

07:39.640 --> 07:42.479
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

07:42.480 --> 07:45.331
Hey, I'm a police officer.
This is an arrest.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.479
This man's crazy. Look at him.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.839
He'll kill me. You're just
going to stand there?

07:49.840 --> 07:51.087
Freeze!

07:51.880 --> 07:53.241
I'm a cop!

07:53.440 --> 07:56.039
I'm Detective John Kimble.
This man is under arrest.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.844
I'm checking.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.239
You can't just walk in here
and put a gun in my face.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.408
I'm trying to get a manicure.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.650
I have witnesses.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.685
I have a witness, too.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.482
It's murder one this time.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.400
Now you're mine.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.848
The bastard handcuffed
me to a dead man!

08:16.200 --> 08:17.399
A dead man!

08:17.400 --> 08:19.045
Come on. Sit down.

08:19.760 --> 08:24.079
Now, did Danny ever say what
Crisp's wife looked like?

08:24.080 --> 08:25.279
No.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.839
Did he ever say what name
she was using in Oregon?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.639
He didn't say anything.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.399
Look, I just want to go home.

08:31.400 --> 08:36.359
After the lineup, I'll drive you
home. I'll even buy you dinner.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.599
I'll even cook you dinner.

08:38.600 --> 08:43.488
I'm not doing any lineup, and there
ain't jack shit you can do about it!

08:43.640 --> 08:47.359
I've been after Crisp for four years, and
she's letting my key witness walk away?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.039
Kimble, sit down!

08:49.040 --> 08:50.119
Sit down.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.481
- Sit.
- Sit.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.119
Now listen to me. He
killed your boyfriend.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.719
All you have to do is point your finger,
and we can put him away for 30 years.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.685
He wasn't my boyfriend.
I hardly knew the guy.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.605
I know you're in there.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.119
I know what you want,
but you ain't getting it.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.079
No lineup, no testimony.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.839
So shove your handcuffs
up your ass!

09:18.840 --> 09:20.371
Now let me out of here!

09:20.840 --> 09:22.371
Slow down!

09:22.640 --> 09:24.251
Open it and let me out!

09:30.000 --> 09:32.248
O'Hara, meet Kimble.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.679
Kimble's been on this a long time.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.799
Hi.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.039
Let me take care of Cindy.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.765
She'll make Crisp. I guarantee it.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.524
What are you going to do, handcuff her
to your car and take her for a ride?

09:43.640 --> 09:46.047
I'm not going to offer
to cook her dinner.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.762
Kimble, hold on a second. I...

09:49.720 --> 09:51.439
Difficult man. Got
to get to know him.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.971
Oh, I can't wait.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.479
Aah!

10:16.400 --> 10:17.806
Hey, baby.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.330
What you mean, "Hey, baby?"

10:29.880 --> 10:31.081
Shit!

10:32.520 --> 10:34.399
Oh, excuse me.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.523
I forgot to introduce myself.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.679
My name is John Kimble,

10:41.080 --> 10:42.799
And I love my car.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.968
I'll keep an eye on it for you.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.330
You got a beautiful ride.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.399
Shit. Who does he think he is?
He's lucky I didn't kick his ass.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.839
Open up.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.485
You can't come in.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.407
Thank you.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.245
What the fuck?

11:53.800 --> 11:57.129
All right, party's over.
Everyone go home.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.690
Next time, my place.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.486
So who are you, man?

12:03.880 --> 12:05.161
Shit!

12:07.240 --> 12:08.726
I'm the party-pooper.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.966
Hi, Cindy.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.484
Do you mind if I sit down?

12:18.040 --> 12:20.208
No. Sit down, man.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.239
Oh, it's so nice to see you again.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.920
What are you doing
here, you asshole?

12:29.120 --> 12:31.800
Cindy, I don't like you
using foul language,

12:32.040 --> 12:34.004
not a classy girl like you.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.962
Don't you have
anything better to do?

12:37.200 --> 12:38.890
You don't understand.

12:39.160 --> 12:43.445
I have nothing else to do, and
I have nowhere else to go.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.679
Why are you staring
at me like that?

12:47.680 --> 12:49.639
I like you, Cindy.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.639
I'm going to be around you a lot.

12:51.640 --> 12:55.079
Days, nights, weekends, holidays.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.959
No. No, you can't.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.359
Yes, I can.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.319
I'm going to hang out with you

13:01.320 --> 13:03.648
until the end of time.

13:04.240 --> 13:07.410
All right, move it in. Let's go.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.610
Step onto the numbers.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.241
Face front.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.169
Everybody, hands to your side.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.371
That's the creep.

13:18.680 --> 13:19.919
Who?

13:19.920 --> 13:22.521
Number five. That's him.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.771
Good. Very good.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.879
Mr. Crisp, you will be remanded
into custody until your trial.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.889
Bailiff, remove the prisoner.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.400
Shh. Don't say anything. Just take it
easy. I'll take care of it. Trust me.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.719
You know what to do?

13:47.720 --> 13:50.002
I'm your mother, aren't I?

13:59.440 --> 14:01.479
Mind if I talk to my
friend a little bit?

14:01.480 --> 14:03.967
I'm not talking to anybody
without my lawyer.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.726
He's right in here.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.719
You give me the names of your
drug suppliers and distributors,

14:15.720 --> 14:19.606
and I'll tell the judge what a
nice, cooperative killer you are.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.719
You think the jury's
going to convict me

14:21.720 --> 14:23.604
on the testimony of that junkie?

14:25.160 --> 14:26.964
You could be right.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.079
But what about your wife?

14:34.080 --> 14:36.089
You remember her?

14:36.520 --> 14:39.849
All that hard-earned drug
money she stole from you?

14:40.440 --> 14:43.484
How much was it, $3 million?

14:44.440 --> 14:47.041
I bet she would make a
much better witness.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.639
Kimble, you've wasted
years chasing after me,

14:49.640 --> 14:52.199
and what has it gotten you, hmm?

14:52.200 --> 14:53.319
Nothing.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.639
I'll be out in a week,

14:54.640 --> 14:57.684
and you'll still be eating take-out
food in that dump you live in.

14:58.280 --> 15:02.279
Yeah, I know all about you, Kimble.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.324
Without me, you wouldn't
even have a life.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.439
My old lady left
'cause of the money.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.361
Yours left because she just
couldn't stand the sight of you.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.519
I've never seen anyone
so little eat so much.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.239
Yeah, I know. I'm hypoglycemic.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.488
If I don't eat regularly,
I get a little nuts.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.719
So, where you from?

15:24.720 --> 15:26.319
Austria.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.249
How long you been a cop?

15:29.480 --> 15:31.279
I been a cop for 12 years.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.799
My father was a cop,
my brother was a cop,

15:33.800 --> 15:36.199
my mother was a cop's wife.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.399
And I have no hobbies.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.599
Good news.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.639
You two are booked on the first
flight to Portland tomorrow.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.559
Locate Crisp's wife and
offer her immunity

15:45.560 --> 15:47.683
in exchange for her
testimony against him.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.087
No offense to O'Hallahan,

15:51.520 --> 15:54.759
but this is my case,
and I work alone.

15:54.760 --> 15:57.639
He works alone. Not anymore.

15:57.640 --> 16:01.128
She's going in undercover as a
substitute kindergarten teacher.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.479
Not exactly a job for you.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.599
I used to be a teacher.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.839
We'll be fine.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.199
What do I do?

16:08.200 --> 16:10.679
She locates the kid, you find
the mother and the cash,

16:10.680 --> 16:14.439
and Crisp spends his life
making license plates.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.085
Bon voyage.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.803
Oh, and Kimble, the name's O'Hara.

16:24.840 --> 16:28.279
Okay. Here's the wife at 17.
Real name's Rachel Myatt.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.639
She's from Hannibal,
Missouri, class of '76.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.319
Cheerleader, first violin
in the school orchestra,

16:33.320 --> 16:35.519
captain of the girls'
softball team.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.719
Her ambition was "To travel,

16:38.720 --> 16:41.599
"experience life, and
meet interesting people."

16:41.600 --> 16:43.450
Like Crisp.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.531
Okay.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.319
Relax.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.488
Don't let him get to you.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.359
That's her 10 years later.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.239
It's a great shot of an ear.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.959
You get in touch with her parents?

16:59.960 --> 17:01.439
They're both dead.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.405
The only relative she's
got left is the kid.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.164
Hey.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.279
Okay. This is the only
picture we have of him.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.324
Cullen Jr., aged 3 months.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.959
That helps much.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.239
It's the best I could do.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.719
Breakfast, sir? Ma'am?

17:21.720 --> 17:23.959
- Please.
- No. No, no.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.763
That's a first.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.679
Listen, I was just thinking.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.999
Maybe we should take a wild stab
at getting to know each other

17:33.000 --> 17:35.328
before we have to
pretend we're married.

17:35.560 --> 17:36.799
What do you want to know?

17:36.800 --> 17:38.729
How long have we been married?

17:39.960 --> 17:41.199
A long time.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.006
People won't expect us to
talk much to each other.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.999
I want to read it, too. Stop it.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.599
Please? Let me take a look.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.325
Hey, come here.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.810
If you don't stop screwing around back
there, this is what I'll do with you.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.799
Ohh.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.199
What's the matter?

18:05.200 --> 18:06.559
I don't know.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.999
I just don't feel so good.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.519
You hungry?

18:09.520 --> 18:11.290
I got to get out of here right now.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.119
Get those tree stumps out of my
way before I vomit all over them.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.563
Is your wife okay, sir?

18:24.200 --> 18:25.845
Compared to what?

18:33.360 --> 18:38.199
Maybe it was the burrito. Or
it could've been the sausages.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.679
I don't think it was
the crab salad.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.719
It couldn't have been the donuts.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.765
Excuse me.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.922
Oh, I hate feeling like this.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.411
I hate it, too.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.199
Uh-oh.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.759
Uh-oh what?

18:56.760 --> 18:58.919
Uh-oh, pull over.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.039
Now?

19:00.040 --> 19:02.129
Yeah. Please hurry.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.484
The key! Give me the key!

19:48.880 --> 19:50.491
Do you need a hand?

20:10.840 --> 20:11.959
You okay?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.241
I'm fine.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.799
I'll be fine.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.079
Class starts at 9:00
in the morning.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.725
I'll be fine.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.999
You look much better already.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.319
Oh. Kindergarten, 6-year-olds.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.839
That's why I quit
teaching, you know.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.799
I got so sick of
other people's kids.

20:44.800 --> 20:49.324
I was afraid that I'd never
want to have any of my own.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.490
I have a son.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.690
He's 13.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.649
I remember when he was 5.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.839
He lives with his
mother and stepfather.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.519
Aah!

21:10.520 --> 21:11.719
What's the matter?

21:11.720 --> 21:14.810
What... is... that?

21:15.440 --> 21:18.928
Oh, excuse me. I forgot to
tell you. This is my ferret.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.439
He doesn't bite. Don't worry.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.719
Come on. Come on out.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.359
This is all I need, an obstacle.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.039
A goddamn obstacle.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.879
He sends me an obstacle.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.081
Here.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.129
Oh, God.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.919
Don't worry.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.565
I'm going to make it.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.126
I just need a minute.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.679
I'll be ready in just a minute.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.405
I just got...

22:14.080 --> 22:16.089
Oh, God.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.729
How do I look?

22:29.440 --> 22:31.642
Take off the gun.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.325
That's a good idea.

22:38.800 --> 22:42.482
The little bastards are
going to eat you alive.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.599
Get some rest, and don't worry.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.599
I've been working
undercover for a long time.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.122
They're 6-year-olds. How
much trouble can they be?

22:54.360 --> 22:56.439
On second thought,

22:56.440 --> 22:58.130
take the gun.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.519
Matthew...

23:28.520 --> 23:32.439
I sent you to the principal's
office because you punched Jenny.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.291
I know. She poisoned your hamsters.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.519
She told me all about it,
and she's very sorry.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.564
And I'm sorry that I
didn't believe you.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.839
- But you shouldn't punch people.
- But she...

23:46.840 --> 23:49.850
Mr. Kimble, Miss Schlowski
will see you now.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.485
Let's go back to class.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.681
Can I help you?

23:58.720 --> 24:01.526
I'm John Kimble, your new
kindergarten teacher.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.207
We were expecting a Miss O'Hara.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.564
There's been a change of plan.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.839
Four weeks into the new semester,

24:12.840 --> 24:17.159
my superintendent told me I
had to replace Mrs. Hagley,

24:17.160 --> 24:20.762
a kindergarten teacher
of 25 years' experience,

24:20.880 --> 24:24.846
with an undercover police officer,
and he wouldn't even tell me why.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.842
I don't suppose you would do me
the courtesy of filling me in.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.799
I can't do that.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.128
Oh. You can't do that.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.765
I'm watching you.

24:36.160 --> 24:41.079
All I have to do is tell my parents
that you're with the police,

24:41.080 --> 24:45.759
and they'll yank their kids out of this
school so fast, we'd have to close.

24:45.760 --> 24:50.170
And don't you think I won't if I
feel my children are in any danger.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.806
They're not in danger.

24:55.760 --> 25:00.045
I assume you have some
teaching experience.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.522
They wouldn't have
sent me otherwise.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.527
Just wait here a minute.

25:20.760 --> 25:24.681
Everybody sit down on the carpet!

25:30.160 --> 25:32.759
Good morning, everyone.

25:32.760 --> 25:36.521
Good morning, Miss Schlowski.

25:36.880 --> 25:41.639
Your teacher, Mrs. Hagley, had
to go on an important trip.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.959
Where'd she go?

25:42.960 --> 25:44.479
That doesn't matter.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.879
Did she die?

25:45.880 --> 25:49.479
No, Lowell. She went
to see someone.

25:49.480 --> 25:50.839
Did they die?

25:50.840 --> 25:52.849
No, Lowell.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.645
Everyone dies, you know.

25:54.760 --> 25:58.799
I know, but not for
a long, long time.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.759
Now, until Mrs. Hagley comes back,

26:01.760 --> 26:05.203
we have someone special to help.

26:05.640 --> 26:10.448
This is Mr. Kimble, your
new kindergarten teacher.

26:18.520 --> 26:23.399
Now, let's everybody say,
"Good morning, Mr. Kimble."

26:23.400 --> 26:27.810
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.646
Good morning.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.447
They're all yours.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.603
I'll be watching you.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.361
Hi.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.245
How are you?

26:47.560 --> 26:49.489
I'm very happy to be here.

26:50.520 --> 26:53.679
First, I would like to
just get to know you.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.521
Quiet.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.361
I'm going to ask you a
bunch of questions.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.447
I want to have them
answered immediately.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.449
How many of you were
born in Astoria?

27:14.680 --> 27:16.689
Raise your hands. Let's see them.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.439
Okay, hmm.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.639
Now, anyone that was
not born in Astoria,

27:25.640 --> 27:28.320
somewhere outside like
California, raise your hands.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.239
Yes.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.681
I need to go to the bathroom.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.924
Okay. You can go.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.919
Boys have a penis.
Girls have a vagina.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.965
Thanks for the tip.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.119
Yes?

27:57.120 --> 27:59.079
I need to go to the bathroom,

27:59.080 --> 28:01.806
and I can't get these things off.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.439
I'll get someone to help you.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.210
I'll be right back, okay?

28:21.560 --> 28:23.999
You've learned that the
"E" is often silent

28:24.000 --> 28:27.090
when it immediately
follows another vowel.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.848
Now write and say these words...

28:32.600 --> 28:33.919
Oh, um...

28:33.920 --> 28:36.079
Class, uh, Catherine,

28:36.080 --> 28:37.930
can you take over for me, please?

28:38.200 --> 28:39.561
Thank you.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.968
"E" is the fifth letter
of the alphabet.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.319
Yes, can I help you?

28:45.320 --> 28:47.045
I have a problem.

28:47.440 --> 28:52.079
Mr. Kimble, I need to go real bad.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.479
First day?

28:54.480 --> 28:55.727
Yes.

28:56.440 --> 28:57.679
I'll take care of her.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.041
Thank you.

29:01.760 --> 29:04.167
You know, kindergarten
is like the ocean.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.484
Don't turn your back on it.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.959
They're okay.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.799
Don't worry. Everything
is under control.

29:15.560 --> 29:16.761
No.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.761
Monsters.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.362
What are you doing with this?

29:45.840 --> 29:47.769
Aren't you going to break it up?

29:48.040 --> 29:51.881
No. Two more days of
this, and he'll quit.

30:00.720 --> 30:04.083
Shut up!

30:05.720 --> 30:07.959
Shut up! Shut up!

30:07.960 --> 30:09.199
Shut up.

30:15.160 --> 30:17.681
No. Don't start this.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.441
Oh, no.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.082
Aah!

30:48.280 --> 30:49.641
Attention!

30:53.800 --> 30:56.810
This is your new class mascot.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.169
What happened to your dog?

30:59.400 --> 31:00.639
This is not a dog.

31:01.800 --> 31:02.959
This is a ferret.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.571
What's a ferret?

31:04.960 --> 31:06.239
That's a ferret.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.799
Oh!

31:07.800 --> 31:10.799
If he bites you, you
get rabies and die.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.639
No. That's not true.
He never bites.

31:13.640 --> 31:14.959
Can I pet him?

31:14.960 --> 31:17.322
Sure, but one at a time, okay?

31:17.840 --> 31:20.168
Good. Okay, next one. Come on.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.640
Yes.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.562
Good. Yeah.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.159
Good. Now we're having fun.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.919
What's that supposed to mean?

31:56.920 --> 31:59.771
Mrs. Hagley is a lot
better than you.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.806
Is she?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.884
Is she really?

32:06.800 --> 32:09.207
My mom's a teacher in this school,

32:09.800 --> 32:11.839
and she's a lot
better than you, too.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.087
Great.

32:13.520 --> 32:17.519
On Monday nights, my mom tutors
and Mrs. Quinn takes care of me.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.484
She's better than you, too.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.081
Great.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.483
And Frankie, my swimming teacher,

32:23.680 --> 32:27.407
and Gus, my T-ball coach,
are better than you, too.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.168
I really appreciate your honesty.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.927
You happen to know someone
that's not better than me?

32:38.320 --> 32:40.568
I don't know that many people.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.039
John?

32:54.200 --> 32:55.640
Are you there?

33:00.240 --> 33:02.090
How did it go?

33:04.120 --> 33:05.606
Go away.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.763
It went that well, huh?

33:11.080 --> 33:13.123
You take over tomorrow.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.443
And blow our cover?

33:16.040 --> 33:17.446
Can't do it.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.645
They're horrible.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.290
Tell me about it.

33:39.920 --> 33:44.364
He's gay. What kind of a man teaches
kindergarten? He's obviously gay.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.370
A male kindergarten teacher
isn't what I'm used to.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.768
Samantha calls him "The Giant."

33:53.440 --> 33:54.519
There he is.

33:54.520 --> 33:55.801
Where, honey?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.039
Holy cow, is that your new teacher?

34:03.040 --> 34:04.119
Yeah.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.845
Oh, my God.

34:06.960 --> 34:08.279
What are you doing?

34:08.280 --> 34:11.079
- I'm not wearing makeup.
- None of us are.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.239
You're married. You're
allowed to look like slobs.

34:13.600 --> 34:17.079
Be good. I'll be
back to pick you up.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.599
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

34:18.600 --> 34:19.759
Good morning.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.719
I told you he was big.

34:21.719 --> 34:23.409
Play with the kids, honey.

34:26.639 --> 34:28.799
Hi. I'm Jillian, Sylvester's mom.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.686
Do you have a minute?
I'd like to speak with you.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.839
Sure. Please.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.280
Thank you.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.688
A male kindergarten teacher.
That's unusual.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.478
You're not from
around here, are you?

34:44.480 --> 34:46.559
No. I'm not.

34:46.560 --> 34:47.759
Neither am I.

34:47.760 --> 34:49.007
Huh.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.559
Anyway...

34:51.560 --> 34:52.839
Um...

34:52.840 --> 34:54.679
I have a small problem.

34:54.679 --> 34:55.958
Yes?

34:55.960 --> 34:59.403
You see, Sylvester's father
doesn't live with us anymore

35:00.360 --> 35:03.439
and I've just been
worried about Sylvester.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.039
He's been acting a
little strange lately.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.730
You know, doing odd things.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.401
Like what?

35:09.520 --> 35:14.760
Well, it seems that's he's becoming a
little obsessed with playing with dolls.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.446
You know, it's weird.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.799
I think I can help you with that.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.606
- Really?
- He uses the dolls to look up girls' skirts.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.009
I caught him doing it yesterday.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.839
Oh. Oh, well, that's a relief.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.759
But I'll keep an eye on him, okay?

35:30.760 --> 35:32.485
Thank you.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.248
Does Sylvester ever see his father?

35:36.760 --> 35:41.841
No. No, not since he was two.
His father lives in California.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.279
That is far away.

35:45.280 --> 35:46.719
Mmm-hmm.

35:46.720 --> 35:50.208
Well, if you give me
his name and number,

35:50.720 --> 35:53.764
I could talk to him about taking
more interest in his son.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.327
That's very kind, but
I don't think so.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.121
But it's tough on
Sylvester, don't you think?

35:59.400 --> 36:00.519
No.

36:00.520 --> 36:04.327
No, what's tough on Sylvester is his
father left us for another man.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.726
Are you married, Mr. Kimble?

36:10.400 --> 36:11.931
No, I'm not.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.721
He's not married, Mom!

36:18.080 --> 36:19.599
Welcome to Astoria,

36:19.600 --> 36:21.919
the single-parent
capital of America.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.479
Thank you for your time.

36:23.480 --> 36:28.083
I pledge allegiance to the flag

36:28.520 --> 36:32.239
of the United States of America,

36:32.240 --> 36:37.924
and to the republic for which it
stands, one nation under God,

36:40.080 --> 36:42.039
indivisible

36:42.040 --> 36:45.847
with liberty and justice for all.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.011
Are these all your lunches?

36:56.200 --> 36:58.004
You mean you eat other
people's lunches?

36:58.200 --> 36:59.606
Stop it!

37:04.800 --> 37:08.119
Now we're going to do
something extremely fun.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.919
We're going to play a game called,

37:10.920 --> 37:13.691
"Who is my daddy and
what does he do?"

37:13.800 --> 37:14.999
Yes?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.599
Is your daddy a fireman?

37:16.600 --> 37:19.239
He's probably big.
Is he a wrestler?

37:19.240 --> 37:20.319
A basketball coach?

37:20.320 --> 37:22.363
No, no.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.079
What's the matter?

37:24.080 --> 37:25.679
I have a headache.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.039
It might be a tumor.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.685
It's not a tumor!

37:29.000 --> 37:30.565
It's not a tumor at all.

37:33.280 --> 37:39.328
What I meant was you tell me, who
is your daddy and what does he do?

37:39.720 --> 37:41.160
Oh.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.759
Get it?

37:42.760 --> 37:44.610
We start right here. You.

37:44.720 --> 37:49.448
My dad repairs cars driven
by women who are pinheads.

37:51.760 --> 37:55.885
My dad doesn't do
anything since the crash.

37:57.360 --> 38:01.451
My dad gives money to people
that doesn't have money,

38:01.840 --> 38:03.883
and then people use that money,

38:04.360 --> 38:06.279
then they give other money back

38:06.280 --> 38:09.848
and they give the same amount
of money back to my dad.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.039
My dad doesn't live
with us anymore.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.925
He lives in New York
and drives a taxi.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.209
My mom hopes he's going
to die real soon.

38:23.560 --> 38:26.491
My dad watches TV all day long.

38:26.960 --> 38:30.846
My dad works on computers,

38:32.080 --> 38:34.931
and he's, um, the
boss of his company,

38:36.760 --> 38:40.407
and, um, he has a
mustache and a beard.

38:40.760 --> 38:41.999
Mm-hmm.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.119
Yeah.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.519
He doesn't have that
much hair because...

38:46.520 --> 38:51.408
And he... His head is so big
that he can't wear any hats.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.690
My dad's divorced.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.963
My mom's divorced.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.279
My dad, um, is a psychologist,

38:59.280 --> 39:05.931
and he helps people that are hurt or
lost their feelings, and, um, that's it.

39:06.560 --> 39:10.970
Our mom says that our dad
is a real sex machine.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.926
Good.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.324
I don't know what my dad does.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.288
I haven't seen him in a long time.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.485
He lives in France.

39:27.800 --> 39:33.689
My dad is a gynecologist, and he
looks at vaginae all day long.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.005
Thank you. Very good.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.999
Okay. Next, uh...

39:46.000 --> 39:48.043
What's his name with
his back to me?

39:48.640 --> 39:50.239
His name's Zach Sullivan.

39:50.240 --> 39:52.599
He doesn't like anyone
to talk to him.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.959
He's a poo-poo head.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.719
He's a poo-poo face.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.684
He's a ca-ca poo-poo.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.119
He's a poo-poo ca-ca.

40:00.120 --> 40:05.679
Poo-poo ca-ca!

40:05.680 --> 40:07.803
Quiet. That's enough.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.201
Hey, Zach.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.724
Did your daddy teach you this game?

40:18.200 --> 40:22.246
Come on, Zach. Let's all play
together. It's so much more fun.

40:22.800 --> 40:23.999
Leave me alone!

40:25.720 --> 40:27.081
What's that?

40:27.840 --> 40:29.326
It's a fire alarm!

40:29.680 --> 40:31.799
Come on, come on.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.479
Everyone together! Come on.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.839
I'm on fire!

40:34.840 --> 40:36.839
Come on. All together!

40:36.840 --> 40:38.405
I'm on fire!

40:45.920 --> 40:48.248
Very straight. Very straight.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.319
Come on, come on. Get all together.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.363
Everything together. Come on.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.159
Come on. Quiet.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.839
Quiet! Come on.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.769
Shh! Quiet.

41:09.200 --> 41:13.119
Well, we're all glad the
kindergarten class could join us.

41:15.360 --> 41:19.531
That's four minutes. You should
be ashamed of yourselves.

41:21.280 --> 41:24.799
All the other grades, your
times were an improvement,

41:24.800 --> 41:27.606
but they're still not good enough.

41:27.760 --> 41:29.883
I'm very disappointed.

41:31.360 --> 41:33.961
All right, let's get
back into school.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.081
Mrs. Sullivan!

42:00.600 --> 42:02.006
Mrs. Sullivan!

42:08.440 --> 42:11.119
So the doctor says
it's a stomach flu.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.687
I'm fine. I can eat
anything I want.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.279
Let's find a restaurant.

42:15.280 --> 42:17.599
Can we talk business?

42:17.600 --> 42:19.799
There are 14 boys in the classroom.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.924
So far I have three possible
suspects, one likely.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.719
Here's a picture. You listening?

42:24.720 --> 42:26.159
I'm listening.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.959
His name's Zach Sullivan.
What do you think?

42:27.960 --> 42:30.999
He's cute. Doesn't
anybody eat around here?

42:31.000 --> 42:34.090
Listen, he's a dead
ringer for Crisp. Look.

42:35.920 --> 42:39.010
Maybe. Come on, John. I'm hungry.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.642
A table for two.
Thank you very much.

42:41.800 --> 42:42.919
Two hot dogs.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.119
Two hot dogs?

42:44.120 --> 42:45.839
Mr. Kimble! Mr. Kimble!

42:45.840 --> 42:47.039
Dominic.

42:47.040 --> 42:48.526
It's him, Mom.

42:49.040 --> 42:50.519
Joyce.

42:50.520 --> 42:51.639
Hello, Joyce.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.839
Dominic has been a great help.
He's a good kid.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.239
Who's that?

42:56.240 --> 42:57.359
Who?

42:57.360 --> 42:58.641
Her.

42:58.960 --> 43:02.119
Oh, that? Uh, that is, uh...

43:02.120 --> 43:03.759
I am his sister.

43:03.760 --> 43:07.039
Oh, really? I wouldn't
have guessed.

43:07.040 --> 43:10.119
You have to excuse my brother.
He has no manners.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.639
My name is Ursula.
Wonderful to meet you.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.559
I'm visiting here from Austria.

43:14.560 --> 43:17.319
I'm Joyce Palmieri.
I work at John's school.

43:17.320 --> 43:18.399
Ah.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.039
And this is Dominic.

43:20.040 --> 43:21.651
Nice to meet you.

43:21.840 --> 43:24.359
Would you like to
join us for dinner?

43:24.360 --> 43:25.759
- No.
- Ja.

43:25.760 --> 43:26.999
Ja.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.248
Yes, of course.
That would be great.

43:30.840 --> 43:32.759
Hi. There will be four of us.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.200
Table 27.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.479
Why did you tell her
you were my sister?

43:36.480 --> 43:39.604
Relax, butch. The
love doctor is here.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.402
Come to me. I want to start.

43:43.720 --> 43:49.479
Okay. I want a rib eye steak with mashed
potatoes and a large green salad.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.728
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

43:51.840 --> 43:55.559
I want to start with the
spicy chicken wings.

43:55.560 --> 43:58.199
Are they the tiny
ones without meat?

43:58.200 --> 44:00.119
Actually, it's quite
a large serving.

44:00.120 --> 44:01.559
Ah, good.

44:01.560 --> 44:03.285
Ooh, good arms.

44:03.560 --> 44:07.759
And a large bowl of
the clam chowder.

44:07.760 --> 44:11.567
Uh, and the blueberry pie with
ice cream for dessert. Ja.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.403
I like how they talk.

44:19.080 --> 44:23.559
I've been trying to get to know the
parents, but some of them are avoiding me.

44:23.560 --> 44:28.799
Some of them are like that. It's a strange
town that way, especially with new arrivals.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.079
What do you mean?

44:30.080 --> 44:32.639
I think a lot of people
that come to small towns

44:32.640 --> 44:37.479
are trying to get away from something,
or they're hiding something.

44:37.480 --> 44:38.841
Like what?

44:39.920 --> 44:42.519
Well, for example,
what brought you here?

44:42.520 --> 44:45.759
Me? Well, there was an opening
for a kindergarten teacher.

44:45.760 --> 44:50.519
Yeah, but what made you become a kindergarten
teacher? I mean, it is a bit unusual.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.563
John is a bit unusual.

44:53.080 --> 44:54.639
- Well...
- You are.

44:54.640 --> 44:59.959
I was born in Austria. My father was
a teacher. My mother was a teacher.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.079
So is Ursula.

45:01.080 --> 45:02.279
Ja.

45:02.280 --> 45:06.166
We have a tradition in Austria where we
follow the footsteps of our parents.

45:06.360 --> 45:08.239
So, when I moved to this country,

45:08.240 --> 45:12.479
I taught geography and
physical education in Arizona,

45:12.480 --> 45:17.607
and then I coached basketball at an
all-girls school in Rhode Island, but

45:19.000 --> 45:20.964
none of it made me really happy.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.479
Why weren't you happy?

45:23.480 --> 45:25.879
Ja. Why weren't you happy?

45:27.360 --> 45:30.199
Well, I got tired of
teaching teenagers.

45:30.200 --> 45:34.485
Because by the time they came to me, I felt
there wasn't much I could do with them.

45:34.720 --> 45:37.526
I realized that the real
action is in kindergarten.

45:38.840 --> 45:41.088
How long have you been
teaching kindergarten?

45:41.520 --> 45:42.799
It's my second day.

45:42.800 --> 45:43.959
Oh.

45:46.800 --> 45:51.528
Ooh, excuse me, but
it's good. It is good.

45:51.880 --> 45:53.679
Thanks again.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.999
Nice to meet you.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.519
- Thank you.
- Bye.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.679
I had a great time.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.359
Ja, me, too.

46:00.360 --> 46:03.719
Well, Kimble, I think you scored.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.399
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:08.400 --> 46:10.359
What are you talking about?

46:10.360 --> 46:13.679
I'm only interested in her
because she works at the school.

46:13.680 --> 46:15.759
She knows the children
and the parents.

46:15.760 --> 46:18.279
If you were any stiffer,
we could take you surfing.

46:18.280 --> 46:21.399
Now, I know you like that woman.
What is your problem?

46:21.400 --> 46:24.279
The only problem I've got
is that I'm doing your job.

46:24.280 --> 46:28.439
You should be cleaning up the paint and
reading stories about bears that go shopping.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.839
I'm stuck with your job.

46:30.840 --> 46:31.959
Yeah. You are.

46:31.960 --> 46:33.400
That's right. I am.

46:34.200 --> 46:37.519
Look, you're going to be
out of here in a few days.

46:37.520 --> 46:39.961
You told me yourself you
had a few good leads.

46:40.400 --> 46:43.843
You'll be back dealing with
junkies and murderers in no time.

46:55.400 --> 46:57.284
They're pushing me around.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.719
Who?

46:59.720 --> 47:01.081
The kids.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.884
They're walking all over me.

47:11.400 --> 47:15.639
Listen, Kimble. You got to handle
this like any other police situation.

47:15.640 --> 47:18.605
You walk into it showing
fear, you're dead,

47:19.720 --> 47:22.002
and those kids know you're scared.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.651
No fear.

47:29.920 --> 47:31.281
No fear.

47:34.440 --> 47:36.919
Today we're going to
play a new fun game.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.964
It's called "police school."

47:40.640 --> 47:42.079
I'm going to be your sheriff.

47:42.080 --> 47:44.559
You're going to be
my deputy trainees.

47:47.160 --> 47:49.647
Come on. Stop whining.

47:51.320 --> 47:54.842
You kids are soft.
You lack discipline.

47:56.400 --> 47:57.919
Well, I've got news for you.

47:57.920 --> 48:00.279
You are mine now. You belong to me!

48:02.240 --> 48:05.279
You're not going to have your
mommies here to wipe your tushies.

48:05.280 --> 48:06.479
Oh, no.

48:06.480 --> 48:09.365
It's time to turn this
mush into muscles.

48:11.800 --> 48:15.686
No more complaining. No more,
"I have to go to the bathroom."

48:16.800 --> 48:18.684
There is no bathroom!

48:22.160 --> 48:24.799
Now, the first thing the
deputy trainees have to learn

48:24.800 --> 48:27.890
is to freeze whenever
you hear this.

48:31.640 --> 48:33.683
Now, the next time you
hear this whistle,

48:34.360 --> 48:36.519
each one of you get one toy.

48:36.520 --> 48:37.639
How many?

48:37.640 --> 48:39.159
One!

48:39.160 --> 48:42.519
Good. Then bring it back
to the carpet, pronto.

48:42.520 --> 48:43.801
Ready?

48:43.840 --> 48:45.079
Wait for it.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.566
Wait for it.

48:47.720 --> 48:49.126
Sit down.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.047
Ready?

48:53.240 --> 48:55.519
Go quickly. Get your toy.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.279
Go. Go for it.

48:57.280 --> 48:59.239
Yes. Very fast.

48:59.240 --> 49:02.999
Good. Quickly. Bring the
toy back to the carpet.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.919
Bring it back to the carpet.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.521
Quick, quick, quick.
Back to the carpet.

49:08.080 --> 49:09.520
Quickly.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.606
Emma.

49:15.720 --> 49:19.239
Emma, take your toy to the carpet.

49:19.240 --> 49:22.489
I'm not a policeman.
I'm a princess.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.402
Take your toy back to the carpet.

49:26.720 --> 49:28.843
I'm not a policeman!
I'm a princess.

49:29.480 --> 49:30.841
Take it back!

49:32.040 --> 49:33.765
All right.

49:42.280 --> 49:44.079
Very good.

49:44.080 --> 49:45.691
You did very well.

49:46.240 --> 49:48.124
Now we're going to
play another game.

49:48.480 --> 49:53.439
When you hear two whistle blows,
take your toy back where you got it

49:53.440 --> 49:55.079
and come right back.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.279
How many whistle blows?

49:56.280 --> 49:57.959
Two!

49:57.960 --> 49:59.359
Good. Ready?

50:00.960 --> 50:02.241
Go.

50:02.440 --> 50:03.599
Come on.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.399
Come right back to the carpet.

50:05.400 --> 50:08.599
Yes. It works. This is great.

50:08.600 --> 50:14.250
Faster, faster. Come on. Yes. Come
back. Terrific. This is working. Wait.

50:15.160 --> 50:17.966
I mean, you're very good deputies.

50:20.520 --> 50:22.484
Your sheriff is proud of you.

50:30.360 --> 50:34.639
One, two, three, four.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.719
One, two, three, four.

50:36.720 --> 50:38.763
One, two, three, four.

50:42.800 --> 50:45.446
Wait! Take me.

50:46.520 --> 50:48.879
Down. Up. Down.

50:48.880 --> 50:51.199
Yes, yes, yes! You've got it.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.529
Yes, Wanda. Good.

50:56.600 --> 50:57.959
Very good.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.919
Big circles. Big circles. Good.

51:00.920 --> 51:06.081
Now do the same thing. Way back.
And down in big circles. Big circles.

51:16.280 --> 51:17.561
Yes.

51:25.800 --> 51:27.959
This is a fire drill!

51:27.960 --> 51:29.519
This is a fire drill.

51:29.520 --> 51:30.881
Run to the door.

51:32.560 --> 51:37.846
Dominic, don't forget Ferret.
Yes. It's a fire drill. Come on.

51:38.960 --> 51:41.049
Oh, this is terrible.

51:41.360 --> 51:43.562
Come on. Come on.

51:44.960 --> 51:47.159
29.

51:47.160 --> 51:48.519
30.

51:48.520 --> 51:50.559
31.

51:50.560 --> 51:52.319
32.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.885
33.

51:54.520 --> 51:58.759
One more. Come on.
Down and up. Yes!

51:58.760 --> 52:02.759
Yes! Zach is the winner.
Come on, you guys.

52:10.320 --> 52:13.959
March, two, three, four.
March, two, three, four.

52:13.960 --> 52:16.679
Swing your arms, two, three, four.

52:16.680 --> 52:19.279
Swing them high. Two, three, four.

52:19.280 --> 52:23.610
One, two, three, four.

52:24.440 --> 52:25.846
Wow.

52:25.920 --> 52:28.119
One, two, three, four.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.079
Reading, writing, arithmetic.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.559
Reading, writing, arithmetic!

52:32.560 --> 52:34.719
Too much homework makes me sick.

52:34.720 --> 52:37.239
Too much homework makes me sick!

52:37.240 --> 52:39.399
When it's time to pass the test...

52:39.400 --> 52:41.879
When it's time to pass the test...

52:41.880 --> 52:43.999
Kindergarten is the best.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.199
Kindergarten is the best.

52:48.960 --> 52:52.039
E-I-E-I-O

52:52.040 --> 52:56.239
And on that farm he had a duck

52:56.240 --> 52:59.091
E-I-E-I-O

53:03.080 --> 53:04.930
All right. Take your milk.

53:05.080 --> 53:07.248
It makes you big and strong.

53:11.320 --> 53:13.599
It's story time, Mr. Kimble.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.719
All right.

53:14.720 --> 53:20.279
We all like this one and if you read us a
story now, everybody will go to sleep.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.481
All right.

53:32.400 --> 53:34.159
I used to read this to my son.

53:34.160 --> 53:35.879
What's his name?

53:35.880 --> 53:36.999
Who?

53:37.000 --> 53:38.486
Your son.

53:38.960 --> 53:41.159
Oh, Alex is his name.

53:41.160 --> 53:42.691
Where is he?

53:43.120 --> 53:44.845
He lives with his mother.

53:52.400 --> 53:55.919
You see, his mother
and I, we are...

53:55.920 --> 53:57.519
Divorced. I know.

53:57.520 --> 53:59.324
What's a divorce?

53:59.400 --> 54:04.159
It's when your daddy lives someplace
else and comes over to take you places,

54:04.160 --> 54:06.727
and your mommy says
he's a deadbeat.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.999
No. It's when the daddy doesn't
want to see his little boy anymore.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.759
That's not what it is.

54:12.760 --> 54:16.203
Why don't you want to see
your little boy? Was he bad?

54:17.040 --> 54:19.049
No, he was not bad.

54:20.280 --> 54:22.050
It wasn't his fault at all.

54:23.560 --> 54:28.129
You see, his mommy and
I, we just nev...

54:36.600 --> 54:38.325
Just sit down, okay?

54:39.880 --> 54:41.639
Let me just start reading.

54:41.640 --> 54:43.490
Why don't you all lie down?

54:44.200 --> 54:45.401
Okay.

54:45.960 --> 54:47.969
Good. And rest.

54:51.160 --> 54:54.409
"If you were a bird
and lived on high

54:54.920 --> 54:57.964
"you'd lean on the wind
when the wind came by.

54:58.640 --> 55:01.684
"You'd say to the wind
when it took you away,

55:01.760 --> 55:04.281
"that's where I wanted to go today.

55:05.400 --> 55:08.763
"Where am I going?
I don't quite know.

55:09.280 --> 55:12.051
"What does it matter
where people go?

55:12.560 --> 55:15.411
"Down to the wood where
the bluebells grow.

55:16.040 --> 55:20.609
"Anywhere. Anywhere. I don't know."

56:03.440 --> 56:04.559
Hi.

56:05.600 --> 56:06.847
Hi.

56:12.440 --> 56:14.005
I didn't mean to startle you.

56:18.040 --> 56:19.890
I must have dozed off.

56:20.760 --> 56:23.042
I can't believe you got
them all to sleep.

56:25.280 --> 56:27.005
I worked them hard.

56:28.800 --> 56:34.006
I was wondering if you'd like to come
to my place for dinner tomorrow night.

56:35.680 --> 56:37.370
I would like that.

56:37.760 --> 56:39.166
Yes.

56:39.360 --> 56:42.086
Great. Well, here
are the directions.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.770
How about 6:30, 7:00?

56:45.560 --> 56:47.046
That would be fine.

56:53.280 --> 56:54.527
What?

56:55.640 --> 56:56.887
Um...

56:57.720 --> 57:00.446
You... You've got a
little mustache.

57:01.760 --> 57:04.042
Oh, it must be from the milk.

57:09.720 --> 57:12.366
Well, I'd better get back to class.

57:14.680 --> 57:16.359
I'll see you tomorrow.

57:16.360 --> 57:18.130
See you tomorrow.

58:13.760 --> 58:14.919
Freeze!

58:14.920 --> 58:16.246
No!

58:17.920 --> 58:19.281
No.

58:19.920 --> 58:24.250
This is Henry Shoop, my fiancé.

58:25.240 --> 58:26.521
Hi.

58:27.480 --> 58:28.639
Your fiancé?

58:28.640 --> 58:30.439
Yeah, my fiancé.

58:30.440 --> 58:34.999
Henry, this is obviously
my partner, John Kimble.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.884
Oh, jeez. Uh...

58:37.400 --> 58:38.559
- Hi.
- How you doing?

58:38.560 --> 58:41.491
Let me get this,
and I'll be right out.

58:41.960 --> 58:43.079
Oh!

58:43.080 --> 58:44.770
It's okay, honey.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.765
I'll be right out.

58:46.960 --> 58:48.119
It's my birthday.

58:48.120 --> 58:49.439
Well, congratulations.

58:49.440 --> 58:52.119
Thanks. He came up here
just to surprise me.

58:52.120 --> 58:56.211
And he made me my
favorite. Pasta a olio.

59:01.800 --> 59:03.959
I love you, Henry.

59:03.960 --> 59:05.279
I love you, too, Phoebes.

59:05.280 --> 59:08.159
Uh... Well, I've got
to head back tonight.

59:08.160 --> 59:09.679
I've got to work.

59:09.680 --> 59:11.279
Henry's a chef.

59:11.280 --> 59:12.639
I'm a chef.

59:12.640 --> 59:13.959
You're marrying a chef?

59:13.960 --> 59:15.839
I'm marrying a great chef.

59:15.840 --> 59:17.159
That figures.

59:17.160 --> 59:19.479
You mean that, a great chef?

59:19.480 --> 59:21.319
Of course. You're a genius, Henry.

59:21.320 --> 59:22.719
Not just a good chef?

59:22.720 --> 59:26.199
Well, nice to meet you.
Congratulations. Happy birthday.

59:26.200 --> 59:27.479
Thanks. You want some of this?

59:27.480 --> 59:29.319
It wasn't overcooked?

59:29.320 --> 59:30.479
You're the best.

59:30.480 --> 59:32.966
It wasn't a little overcooked?
No. Al dente.

59:43.400 --> 59:44.647
Zach.

59:47.920 --> 59:50.439
Excuse me. I'm John
Kimble, Zach's teacher.

59:50.440 --> 59:53.439
I didn't know he was following me.

59:53.440 --> 59:57.159
Hi. I've been leaving
messages on your machine.

59:57.160 --> 59:58.919
I'm sorry. Things have been hectic.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.610
What about now?

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.411
Uh...

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:08.283
Go for a little walk. Your
teacher and I have to talk.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.040
Uh...

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.444
I know what this is about.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.007
I suppose you saw the
bruises on Zach's legs?

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.159
My husband has started
counseling about this.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.964
He's been going for
three weeks now.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.243
Please don't bring the school system
into it. It will make matters worse.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.531
He's beating you, too?

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.999
If he wasn't going to counseling, I could
see the point of saying something.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.680
But I'm sure there won't
be any more occurrences.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.124
You won't say anything, will you?

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.520
Please?

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.689
If he does it again,
I press charges.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.286
Zach.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.761
You got the stuff?

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.961
Thanks, man.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.687
Here, lady. I gave her your stuff.
Where's the rest of my money?

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.570
Who are you, old lady?

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.844
Your fairy godmother.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.801
Come in.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.639
Hi. It took all day, but I found out
Zach Sullivan and his mother...

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.491
- Aren't related to Crisp.
- I just found out.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.239
Oh. I got a bottle of
wine for your big date...

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.119
It's not a date, I know.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.199
But Joyce shouldn't think that.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.999
Thanks. I don't think
it's a good idea.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.201
Why not?

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.359
Quickest way to slip up
doing undercover work

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.211
is doing things you
normally wouldn't do.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.919
Wait a minute.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:37.559
You mean you wouldn't take wine to a
woman who's invited you for dinner?

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.845
Of course you would. And
flowers as well. Here you go.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.367
She'll love them.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.400
Well, here we are.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.208
Wow. This is quite a place.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.999
They must be paying you a lot
more than they're paying me.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.559
I wish it was my house. It
belongs to a friend of mine.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:18.322
After the divorce, he said we could stay
here in exchange for keeping the place up.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.879
You must have nice friends.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.241
Yes, I do.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.931
Dinner won't be ready
for a few minutes.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.811
Can you start a fire?

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.079
It shouldn't be a problem.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.839
I'll show you where the wood is.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.041
All right.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.610
Come on. Come on!

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.961
Right here.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.006
In here.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.399
This is my secret hiding spot.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.399
Wow. This is amazing.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.090
I made it myself.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.399
- What's this?
- Don't touch that!

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.285
It's a laser, and it'll burn
a hole right through you.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.806
Okay. I'll be careful.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.439
Oh, don't shoot.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.519
Boom! Boom!

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.639
Don't shoot.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.250
I put up these lasers
to protect us.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.919
To protect you from what?

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.804
The bad people.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.323
Do you want to see something else?

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.766
Come on.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.359
What?

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.289
See that?

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.006
You mean the tower?

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.330
I'm going to plant one of
my lasers on that antenna.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.959
But I'll have to do it at night.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:41.004
Otherwise the bad people
will know where it is.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.004
Last one to the table
is a rotten banana!

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.999
Have you guys had fun?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.770
- Yeah.
- Be right out!

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.679
What you doing in there?

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.564
I'm lost. Where is the dining
room? This house is huge.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.928
Follow me, silly.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.927
These are beautiful pictures
of you and Dominic.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.767
Thank you.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.922
When I was putting Dominic to bed,
he mentioned you had a son, too.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.891
That's right. But I'm divorced.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.919
I'm lucky. My ex got remarried
to a very nice man.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.884
He's really good to my son.

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.290
I see him a lot.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.599
What about your ex-husband?
Does he see Dominic a lot?

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.486
Uh, no. After the divorce,
he moved back to France.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.970
What about child
support and alimony?

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.359
Does he take care of you?

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.483
I'm sorry about being so personal.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:48.169
I was so glad to see him go I
didn't worry about that part.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.439
Dominic doesn't even remember him.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.369
I prefer it that way.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.246
Are you sure?

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.801
Yeah.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.319
Why?

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:06.482
Well, Dominic was talking to me
about having to move around a lot

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.650
to keep the bad people away.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.199
Bad people?

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.359
Something about having to leave
in the middle of the night

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.050
and leave his toys behind.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.005
Oh, God.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.322
I thought he'd
forgotten about that.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.846
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to upset you.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.765
It's not your fault.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:35.091
The truth is, my ex-husband
is a walking nightmare.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.608
He didn't leave us, we left him.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.531
He found out where we were
and tried to kidnap Dominic.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.043
He doesn't know where we are now,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:56.040
Of course. I'm glad he's in
France and doesn't live nearby.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.489
He doesn't live in France.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.406
I told Dominic that
he lived in France.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.724
I didn't know who my ex-husband
was when I married him.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.563
I was young and stupid,
and I made a mistake.

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:25.721
I don't want Dominic to pay for it.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.564
Look, nobody around here
knows anything about this.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.402
I can't even believe I told you.

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:44.086
You have to promise me
you won't tell anyone.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.404
You can trust me.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:58.319
That's very good. Perfect.
Okay. Let's try it again.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:00.118
Mary, you first.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.238
Four scores and seven years ago.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.921
Four scores and seven years ago.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.328
Our forefathers brought...

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.960
Four fathers?

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:15.759
Mr. Kimble, did Lincoln
have four fathers?

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.078
Uh...

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.519
I had three fathers.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.609
One named Walt, two named Ralph.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.644
Did Lincoln have four mothers?

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.238
As a matter of fact,
he had two mothers.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.442
Unfortunately, the first one died.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.319
I knew it.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.599
Um... Okay.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.519
Let's take a break. Come on.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.651
I want you to walk
around in a circle. Go.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.091
Start. Come on.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.919
Well, Joyce's story about
the house checked out.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:57.439
It belongs to a guy who only
uses it during the ski season.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.039
She's got under $1,000 in the
bank, no stocks, no bonds,

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.639
no other assets under the
name Joyce Palmieri.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.287
Her teacher's salary is less
than mine, which is pathetic.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.839
Keep looking. Check for offshore
accounts under Dominic's name...

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.328
She doesn't live like someone
with millions of dollars.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.839
She doesn't even seem the type.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.247
Kimble, this might not be her.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.799
It's got to be her.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.005
Why? Because she doesn't want to have
anything to do with her ex-husband?

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.199
I know it's her.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.639
Know what I think?

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.842
You want it to be her.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:35.004
You really like her,
and it's scaring you.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.599
Excuse me!

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.919
Surprise!

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.999
Ladies!

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.725
Ladies, surprise.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.119
Obviously, I'm not
into baking cakes,

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:48.679
so I brought these little things
to donate for the raffle prizes.

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.319
Who the hell is that?

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.319
She's the one I was
telling you about.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.205
Her husband ran away
with another guy.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.249
It's been terrible for her.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.519
You're not getting
mellow on me, are you?

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.679
Three, four.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.199
- Hi.
- One, two, three...

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.319
Hi.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.679
Come on. One, two, three, four.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.564
Come on. Go, go.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.879
I see they stuck you with the
Gettysburg Address this year.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.730
They sure did.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.245
Company, halt!

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.241
Um...

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.924
About last night...

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.484
I've been thinking about it, and...

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.602
I'm glad I told you
all those things.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.651
So am I.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.919
Um, I... I better get going.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.441
Yeah. I have to get going, too.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.599
Is everything okay?

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.881
Yeah.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.610
See you tomorrow at the fair.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.850
I'm looking forward to it.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.759
What are you looking at?

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.087
Shh!

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.045
March! One, two, three, four.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.281
I was just talking to the
teacher, that's all.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.599
Yeah. Don't laugh.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.759
Okay. I'm proud of you. Keep going.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.008
I'm sorry Zach's late.
The car wouldn't start.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.286
You be a good boy. I love you.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.879
Hi, champ.

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:38.127
Oh!

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.731
What's the matter?

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.886
Oh, no.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.890
I fell down again.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.730
Hey, wait a minute.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.286
Uh...

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.959
I forgot to close the door to the
basement, and Zach had a bad fall.

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.719
The doctor says it's not
as bad as it looks.

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.599
You all say the same
thing, "He fell down."

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.599
Don't you have anything
better to say?

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.679
It's true!

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.201
I don't have to justify
myself to you!

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.928
You have no right talking
to me like that.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.999
How are you doing?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.159
You must be the Mr. Kimble
we hear so much about.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.479
You hit the kid, I hit you.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.011
You bastard!

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.045
You're not worth it.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.882
I'm pressing charges against you.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.728
Excuse me, everybody.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.479
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have hit the man,
especially in front of the children.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.045
It was a mistake.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.325
I checked you out.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.199
There is no record of you ever
having taught at any public school,

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.368
in California or anywhere else.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:12.801
Mr. Kimble, you have no teaching
experience whatsoever, do you?

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.359
Someone finally noticed.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.079
I thought the introduction of
a ferret was a horrible idea,

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.850
but the children seemed to like it.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.719
I thought the use of your police
whistle was outrageous...

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.199
That's all I could think of.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.244
Please allow me to finish.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.126
Sorry.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.610
But it worked.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.684
I have no idea what kind
of police officer you are,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.807
but you're a very good teacher.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.205
Thank you.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.404
Now, will you tell me
something? Don't lie.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:03.121
What did it feel like to
hit that son of a bitch?

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.882
It felt great.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.646
Yeah.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.279
Well, tomorrow morning.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.279
Bright and early.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.519
Thank you.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.881
Yeah.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.085
Yeah, that's her.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.885
And there goes our goddamn case.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.159
Tell O'Hara and Kimble their witness
is dead, so Crisp is going to walk.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.039
We want them back here.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.049
We've got lots of
other cases to clear.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.759
O'Hara says they think
they've located the wife.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.959
And the money?

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.479
They're looking into it.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.559
Bullshit.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.559
Have them tell the wife we're letting
Crisp go, and he knows where she is.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.919
If she wants police protection,
she'll produce the money.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.121
Yes, sir.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.719
Sorry it took so long, Cullen.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.285
Hey, you're looking great.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.525
I love you, Mother.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.849
We're going to be a
family again, son.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.007
Go!

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.399
Fourscore and seven years ago...

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.199
Fourscore and seven years ago...

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.239
Our forefathers brought
forth on this continent...

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.399
Our forefathers brought
forth on this continent...

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.879
A new nation...

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.879
A new nation...

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.119
Conceived in liberty...

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.719
Conceived in liberty...

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.319
And dedicated to the proposition...

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.439
And dedicated to the proposition...

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.559
That all men are created equal...

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.999
That all men are created equal...

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.759
And that government...

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.959
And that government...

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.199
Of the people...

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.279
By the people...

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.759
And for the people...

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:58.203
Shall not perish from this earth.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.009
Thank you very much.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.119
Oh!

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.530
I'd like to introduce you to
our kindergarten teacher.

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.959
He came to us as a
substitute teacher,

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:32.131
and he's proven to be
a wonderful asset.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.959
Let's welcome him
into our community

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:39.085
and hope that he considers
staying on a permanent basis.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.319
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.879
Mr. John Kimble.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.439
Nice town.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.801
Hmm.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.201
Ahh! Smell that fresh air.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.199
We should think about
buying something up here,

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.722
like some log cabin in
the woods near a lake.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:36.119
Kids love that outdoor
kind of stuff.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.049
I'll be in the pharmacy.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.129
Try not to step in anything.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.799
I'd like to help you.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.082
But we're pretty much out
of the race cars, unless...

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.609
This is the last one.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.559
It's still in great shape.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.479
If you don't mind
waiting, I'll wrap it up.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.919
I'll knock 10% off...

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.919
I have a better idea.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.248
I'll pay you twice
what he's charging.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:18.046
I promised my boy I'd get him one.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.439
I'd love to help you, but my kid's
been bugging me since Christmas.

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.679
I'll pay you four times
what it's worth.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.769
Get your kid something even better.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.441
Sorry. Can you gift-wrap it?

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.159
Hanna, could you wrap that, please?

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.600
No harm in trying.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.847
Tourists.

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:45.079
Great, Dominic. You're doing well.

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.199
I'll wait over here for you, okay?

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.401
Okay.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.919
Great day, huh?

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.719
We've run out of time.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.048
We've got to press Joyce now.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.759
What do you mean?

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.279
Cindy O.D.'d last night.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.399
Shit.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.439
They released Crisp this morning.
He's probably on his way here.

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.599
Salazar told me to tell you this.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.199
If Joyce is Crisp's wife,

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.959
she's got to cooperate
about the money,

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.959
or she gets no police protection.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.279
Bastard.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.290
Ursula, how are you?

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.761
What?

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:35.004
I've got to tell you the truth.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.479
Her name's not Ursula.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.125
She's not my sister.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.879
I beg your pardon?

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.809
We're not who you think we are.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.206
What is this?

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.125
We're police officers.

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.239
We know who you are...

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.319
Rachel.

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.519
This is a joke, right?

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.639
No. This is no joke.
You took $3 million.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.719
I think...

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:04.241
Crisp knows where you are.
He could be here any minute.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:06.919
Where's Dominic?

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:11.519
You'll get immunity for your
testimony, but we need you to help us.

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.839
Where's Dominic?

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.399
On a pony.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.679
We'll offer protection if you
tell us about the money.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.279
There's no money,
you son of a bitch.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.720
There never was!

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.199
No, it's not fair!

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.719
I'm not finished yet!

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.679
The bad people have found us.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:30.519
What do you mean, "no money?"

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:31.879
Why are you mad at Mr. Kimble?

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.570
Because he's a jerk.

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.004
Leave me alone!

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.919
Joyce, wait! Wait!

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.919
If you didn't take the
money, why is he after you?

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.849
He doesn't want me.
He wants Dominic.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.919
She's going to run again.

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.246
Yeah.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.879
Unless we do something about it.

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.445
Yeah.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.762
Hey, snap out of it!

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.119
Daryl. Daryl.

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:17.479
I'm sorry. I wanted to
give you a second chance.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:18.886
$200 cash.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.770
What is wrong with you?

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.559
I'm still not getting through
to you, am I, Daryl?

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:35.639
Mother, got this great
surprise for Junior.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.599
That'll be $57.90.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.599
$57.90.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:45.409
Children's aspirin, children's
decongestant, antihistamine.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.279
A thermometer?

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.759
A lot of flu going around, right?

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.119
It is the season.

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.639
The boy's not sick.

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.599
Doesn't hurt to take precautions.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:01.159
Mother, you are going
to make him sick.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.439
You stuffed all this crap into
me, and nothing was wrong.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.166
That's why there was
nothing wrong with you.

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.925
Now, how can you argue with that?

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.127
Joyce!

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.648
Joyce! Dominic!

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.239
You bastard! Where's Dominic?

01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.559
I don't know. What happened?

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.039
You led him here. If he has
Dominic, I'll kill you.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.599
Let go of me!

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.559
We'll find him. Stop it.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.719
We'll find him.

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.399
Dominic!

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.679
Did he say anything before he left?

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:17.399
He said something about
getting his lasers.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.571
Lasers? I think I know where he is.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.044
Aah! Help!

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.604
Help! Help!

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:02.439
Somebody! Help!

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.519
Hold on!

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.119
I'll get him down.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.319
Help!

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.319
Hold on. I'm right here.

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:09.639
Good boy.

01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.759
All right. Just hold on.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.599
Okay. Just hold on.

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:16.599
Oh, good. Okay.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.239
I was going to put the
lasers in the antenna.

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.408
I know. Don't worry
about anything now.

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.079
I got you. Just hold on tight now.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.691
Hold on tight, okay?

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:28.961
Good.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.599
If I lost Dominic, I don't
think I could go on living.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.199
You're not going to lose him.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.767
That's right. I'm not.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.846
Cullen said I stole his money so these
creeps would follow us for a reward.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.439
You don't know what he's like.

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.479
Oh, yes, I do. I know him well.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.479
That's why I don't want
him to get you two.

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.479
Can't trust you or anybody.

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.839
You can trust me.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.644
That's what you said before.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.090
And you turned out to be a cop.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.365
I... I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.799
I wish I was a
kindergarten teacher,

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.809
but I'm not.

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.159
I'm a cop.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.089
That's all I know how to be.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.290
I have to get out of here.

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.886
You have a son.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.249
If you were me, you'd
do the same thing.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.524
I have a son I've hardly
seen in seven years.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.369
I don't mean anything to him.

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.845
My ex-wife got remarried.

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.451
She doesn't want me
to be part of his life.

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.522
I lost my family.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.039
I should never have let it happen.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:02.242
Why are you telling me all of this?

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.248
I don't want to lose you.

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.324
I don't want to lose Dominic.

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:20.325
I swear you'll never have
to run from him again.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:37.879
Don't worry about anything, okay?
We're going to be right across the hall.

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.399
Everything's going to be fine.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.359
We just want to be extra careful.

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.479
Thanks.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.761
Don't worry.

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.126
All right, all right. Settle down.

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.399
Good morning.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:01.571
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.959
Sit down.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:06.999
It's very nice to
see you all again.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.959
Meet my very good
friend, Phoebe O'Hara.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.279
Good morning, Phoebe.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:17.279
Miss O'Hara is going to talk to you
about something very important.

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:21.759
So pay attention to what
she has to say, okay?

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.119
Remember, no fear.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.129
Thanks.

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.286
Yeah?

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:33.679
Boys have a penis.
Girls have a vagina.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.359
Well, you taught them the basics.

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.159
That's important.

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:48.479
Okay, now, today
we're going to talk

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.519
about something else
that's really important.

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:53.929
Today we're going to
talk about strangers.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:59.645
If a stranger knocks on your
door, never answer the door.

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.239
Because we never talk to strangers.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.679
Let's say that together.

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.439
We never talk to strangers.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.559
Right.

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.999
Can we talk to kids?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.599
Yeah, it's okay.
You can talk to kids.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.245
What about dogs?

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.839
Huh?

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.799
Can we talk to dogs?

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:21.239
Yeah, you can talk to dogs.

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.239
But what you can't do,

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:26.759
what you must never ever do is...

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:31.090
Never talk to strangers.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.919
On the kindergarten level,

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:37.439
we try to emphasize the three C's:

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:41.486
Caring, courtesy and courage.

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:44.799
Courage.

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.359
That's my philosophy, too.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.359
Are you a single parent, Mr. Green?

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.043
No, my wife had to stay behind to
complete the sale of our home.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:58.560
I'm checking the schools
before we buy a home here.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.039
Most kindergarten
children can't read yet.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.279
My son can.

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.319
He reads at 6? That's good.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.719
And writes. I taught him myself.

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.888
He sounds like a special child.

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:12.799
He is. He's a great athlete.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.479
Here's what you've waited
for. The kindergarten.

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:16.999
Have a look.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.039
Oh, Dominic, Dominic,

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:22.599
Dominic is king of the mountain!

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:25.119
Way to go, Dominic.

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.679
Here's your crown.

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:27.879
Congratulations, Dominic.

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:29.759
The king of Mount Kimble!

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.119
Dominic.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.919
Ahh!

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.999
He looks odd, but he's
a wonderful teacher.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.039
Yes, I'm sure he is.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.279
Did you see Cullen Jr.?

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.639
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:53.239
She calls him Dominic.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.599
She'd always wanted
to name him Dominic.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.439
What a dumb name.

01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:00.120
Put that cigar out.
It's unhealthy for the kid.

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.848
Then you make your airplane
go up into the clouds.

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:03.039
Check it out.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.359
Right.

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.999
Okay, stay calm.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.079
Okay, it's probably a fire drill.

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.279
Oh, man.

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.679
Kimble, the hallway's
full of smoke.

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:15.679
Okay, this is a fire drill.
Come on.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.239
This is the real thing.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.919
Just the way we practiced.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:21.279
Go out there.

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.529
Fast. Just the way we practiced it.

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:30.564
Come on.

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.199
Come on.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.926
It's only water. Don't be scared.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.999
Stay close to the wall. Let's go.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.159
Come on. Come on.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.679
Dominic, stay close to me, okay?

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:51.559
Stay close to me.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.759
Stay behind me.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:58.246
Don't get separated.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.559
Aah!

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.639
Are you all right?

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.519
Come on. Let's go.

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.165
Dominic, wait!

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.762
Dominic!

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:26.759
Help! Somebody help me!

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:27.879
Help!

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.999
Stranger!

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.599
- Stranger!
- Stranger!

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.759
Stranger!

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.959
Dominic! Where's Dominic?

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:38.650
Dominic!

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.319
Okay, stay together. Stay together.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.279
Stay together. Hold
onto your partner.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.839
Okay, don't lag behind.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.319
Hold onto my hand.

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.599
Stay together.

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.039
Where's Dominic?

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.279
He's inside. Kimble's
looking for him.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.481
Joyce!

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:20.887
Joyce!

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:51.679
Help!

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.439
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.563
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:57.839
It's okay.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.799
I'm a fireman.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.650
I help people.

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:08.047
Well, where's your hat?

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:10.406
My hat?

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.891
I love this.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:17.679
I can't fool my own boy.
He's just 6 years old.

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:21.805
You're right. I'm no jerk fireman.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.279
I'm going to tell you
something, Dominic.

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.279
It's going to be hard
for you to understand,

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:32.211
but you got to believe me.

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:40.319
I'm your father, Dominic.

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.409
Your father.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.408
Don't you recognize me?

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.279
No.

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.799
Sure you do. It's me.

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:52.970
Don't you remember twinkle,
twinkle, little star?

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:56.599
We have the same kind of hands.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.359
Don't you remember?

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:01.839
You're not my father.
My father lives in France.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.319
Your mother told you that,
but that's not true!

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.759
I'm your father!

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:09.239
I've been searching for
you for five years.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:12.119
Help! Help!

01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:13.639
Dominic, I'm your father.

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:17.242
You're going to have to do what
I say. Do you understand?

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:21.919
Freeze!

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:25.079
Don't you know there's a fire?

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:26.839
We thought it was another drill.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.405
Well, get out!

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:29.801
Yes, sir.

01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.679
Whoa, honey.
That's a fire in there.

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:54.519
I got a kid in there. I'm a cop.

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:57.039
If I need a ticket
fixed, I'll call you.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.959
In the meantime, stay out. Go on.

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.241
All right.

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:39.202
Quiet, you hear me? Quiet.

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:46.999
No!

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.399
Rachel!

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.679
Let go!

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.039
Just what I need.

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:52.559
Please, let him go.

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.039
Let him go!

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.288
How the hell do you
get out of here?

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.288
Please, please, don't do this!

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.119
You're scaring him!

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:06.359
Scared? Of course he's scared.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.439
You told him lies about me.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.159
My son doesn't know
me because of you.

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.399
Listen! Just listen.

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.399
You stole him from me!

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:17.039
Please, give him back.

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:18.559
Don't touch him!

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.889
Dominic, I had to do it!

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.039
I didn't want to do it.
She made me.

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.925
Everything's going
to be okay, Dominic.

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:30.399
Dominic?

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.761
Come back.

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:35.650
We're getting out of here. Dominic?

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:39.486
Going to start a whole new family.

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.366
Dominic!

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:47.119
Gotcha!

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.448
I love you. Do you understand?

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.999
Tell me you understand that.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.079
Say it. Say it!

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.965
I understand.

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.004
Daddy.

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.199
Daddy.

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:06.199
Hold it! Right there.
Drop it! Hurry!

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.799
Don't. Don't.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.559
He's not your hostage.
He's your son.

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.039
Drop it. On the floor.

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:13.959
You'll do this to your own son?

01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:16.959
Drop it! I'm losing it! Hurry!

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.079
Relax. I'm putting it down.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.327
Hurry!

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.599
Here it is. Here it is.

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:25.201
Just don't harm the boy, okay?

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.199
Good. Good. That's smart.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.119
All right.

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:34.159
Why don't you let the boy go now?

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:35.639
The boy is mine!

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.159
He's my boy!

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.839
You get your own goddamn family!

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.687
No!

01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.279
Are you okay?

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.999
I'm okay. Get Dominic.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.999
Okay. Dominic!

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.519
Dominic!

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.322
Where's my grandson?

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:00.450
I don't know.

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.399
Where's my grandson?

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:07.170
Go to hell.

01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:12.764
That's where you're going,
you son of a bitch!

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.289
You're not so tough without
your car, are you?

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:40.406
Mr. Kimble, are you all right?

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:26.162
Oh, I hate this.

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:33.359
Nah, he doesn't want to eat that.

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.879
He's a tough guy.

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.039
Tough guys don't eat Jell-O.

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.199
I'll come back later.

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.279
Hi.

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.970
Hi. How you feeling?

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.839
Much better.

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.359
How about you?

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:45.719
I'll live.

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.919
Check out of here.
This stuff will kill you.

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:50.039
Just don't throw up on me.

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:54.928
I'm not going to throw up on
you, but I am going to kiss you.

01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:58.599
Phoebe.

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.211
Thanks.

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:03.083
Thanks, partner.

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:05.359
Sure.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.839
How's everybody feeling today?

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.079
I brought goodies. Did I do that?

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.884
Give me the flowers.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.439
I got some goodies and...

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.919
I got it caught.

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:17.559
And something I cooked myself.

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:21.319
I almost didn't recognize you
with all your clothes on.

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.010
You look good yourself.

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:26.919
Did I... I'm sorry.

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.279
The wedding.

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.919
Yeah. Uh...

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.122
You're coming to the
wedding, right?

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.890
Is it safe?

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:39.241
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.401
So...

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:45.363
Where do we send the invitation?

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:47.244
Hmm?

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.362
They're all yours.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.759
Hi, kids.

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:38.359
Mr. Kimble!

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:39.839
I'm back.

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.159
Didn't join the union until...

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.839
Class, excuse me.

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:23.250
Uh-oh. They're going to do it.
