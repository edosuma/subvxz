00:08.609 --> 00:10.781
Cyd, Shelby, I'm happy to
do this experiment for you

00:10.781 --> 00:13.914
to see if a turtle can
chew bubble gum, but as
I explained to you before,

00:13.914 --> 00:18.589
the turtle you saw
do it in that commercial
is a cartoon.

00:18.589 --> 00:20.391
He's totally gonna do it.

00:20.391 --> 00:23.894
Get it, Kyle!
Be the turtle
that chewed!

00:23.894 --> 00:25.396
Go! Go! Go!
Come on, we believe
in you, Kyle.

00:25.396 --> 00:28.329
ALL: Go! Go! Go!

00:28.329 --> 00:30.631
(WHOOPING AND APPLAUSE)

00:30.631 --> 00:33.664
Technically, he didn't
chew. That bubble came
out the wrong end.

00:34.765 --> 00:36.837
Watching Kyle eat gum
is making me hungry.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.339
I wish we'd ordered
a pizza earlier.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.471
We can!

00:40.471 --> 00:41.912
It should be
here any second.

00:41.912 --> 00:43.844
You jumped back
30 minutes and
ordered a pizza?

00:43.844 --> 00:46.347
Forty five. Ray's car
is always breaking down.

00:46.347 --> 00:49.950
Here's your pizza.
Sorry I'm late,
my car broke down.

00:51.582 --> 00:53.384
Maybe you should
get a new car.

00:53.384 --> 00:56.287
Oh, hadn't thought
of that every time my
butt-faced manager

00:56.287 --> 00:58.329
tells me to
get a new car.

00:58.329 --> 01:02.233
If you couldn't tell,
his name is Glenn,
and I hate him.

01:04.834 --> 01:07.638
You two shouldn't
use time travel for
such frivolous things.

01:07.638 --> 01:09.740
Are you familiar with
the butterfly effect?

01:09.740 --> 01:11.542
Of course I know
what it is.

01:11.542 --> 01:14.805
But maybe you could just
explain it in simple,
easy to understand language

01:14.805 --> 01:16.807
for the sake of anyone
who may not know.

01:16.807 --> 01:17.978
I know what it is.
Me, too.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.911
Just let him explain it.

01:20.911 --> 01:23.754
The butterfly effect
is the phenomenon in
which small actions

01:23.754 --> 01:25.516
lead to big consequences.

01:25.516 --> 01:27.988
A butterfly flapping
its wings causes
a chain reaction

01:27.988 --> 01:30.961
that leads to a giant storm
halfway around the world.
Around the world.

01:30.961 --> 01:34.965
See? Exactly. Now
everyone's up to speed.

01:34.965 --> 01:38.269
The point is, nine times
out of 10, there may be
no butterfly effect,

01:38.269 --> 01:41.432
but that 10th time,
you could make a small
change in the past

01:41.432 --> 01:44.405
that causes a huge
change in the future.

01:44.405 --> 01:47.878
Okay, we'll only use
time travel for things
that are worth the risk.

01:47.878 --> 01:50.741
Like having seasonal
beverages any time we want.

01:50.741 --> 01:53.284
Or jumping forward
to when those cute
boots go on sale.

01:56.447 --> 02:00.621
Aw, shuds! You did
not just jump forward
and get those boots.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.523
That's, that's right,
we didn't.

02:03.894 --> 02:06.026
And this isn't
a seasonal beverage.

03:11.662 --> 03:13.864
Oh, no.
What's wrong, Barry?

03:13.864 --> 03:17.728
I just got a news alert
that the famous scientist
Dr. Julius Fleming died.

03:17.728 --> 03:19.900
He was my hero since
I was a young laddie.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.773
He was also Scottish,
which is why I referred
to myself as a laddie.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.507
I'm sorry, Barry.
That's a shame.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.939
Well, the real shame
is he died of old age.

03:28.939 --> 03:30.981
He should have perished
like a true scientist,

03:30.981 --> 03:34.315
blasted by neutron
radiation that turns
him into a giant monster

03:34.315 --> 03:37.087
that ravages a small
desert town until he's
brought down

03:37.087 --> 03:41.021
by airplanes and tanks
and the love of
a foxy news reporter.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.254
That's how I wanna go.

03:45.125 --> 03:50.461
Aw! Barry's fantasy death
has a romance subplot.

03:50.461 --> 03:53.304
I can't believe I missed
out on the chance
to meet my hero.

03:53.304 --> 03:57.207
I got to meet my hero.
One time, Abraham Lincoln
came into my room at night

03:57.207 --> 03:58.539
and said we
should go fishing.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.210
Naldo, that was
probably a dream.

04:00.210 --> 04:01.742
Then how I did get
this fishing license

04:01.742 --> 04:04.445
with Abraham Lincoln's
name on it?

04:05.616 --> 04:09.620
I made fake fishing
licenses for all
the presidents.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.353
I almost met
Dr. Fleming when
I was in fourth grade.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.784
He came to speak
at the high school,

04:13.784 --> 04:15.486
but when the doors
opened for his lecture,

04:15.486 --> 04:19.089
the big kids pushed me
out of the way and
I couldn't get in.

04:19.089 --> 04:22.993
I never got to meet him.
And now I never will.

04:22.993 --> 04:24.234
I guess I'm a little sad.

04:24.234 --> 04:25.596
I got this.

04:25.596 --> 04:29.600
(SCREAMS) Was that
to take my mind off
of Dr. Fleming?

04:29.600 --> 04:31.702
Oh, no, there was
a spider on your foot.

04:31.702 --> 04:33.604
Oh, we should really get
some ice on that toe.

04:38.649 --> 04:41.612
Barry's really upset
about Dr. Fleming.

04:41.612 --> 04:43.714
You know what I'm thinking?

04:43.714 --> 04:45.716
That we should jump back
to the fourth grade so
Barry can meet him?

04:45.716 --> 04:48.218
That exactly what I'm
thinking! But you know
what I'm worried about?

04:48.218 --> 04:50.260
That we could butterfly
effect and make
one little change

04:50.260 --> 04:52.022
that causes something
really bad to happen?

04:52.022 --> 04:55.165
That exactly what I'm
worried about! But you
know how I'm feeling?

04:55.165 --> 04:57.728
A little nauseous from
mixing pizza with eggnog?

04:57.728 --> 05:00.901
That exactly
how I'm feeling!

05:00.901 --> 05:04.505
Shelbs, we got to do this.
This is one of those things
that's worth the risk.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.007
It's a chance to use
our power to do
something nice for Barry.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.809
He's always doing
nice things for us.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.412
I know. He made
a turtle fart gum for us.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.385
You're the man, Kyle!

05:18.789 --> 05:20.921
We should have
realized jumping into
our fourth-grade bodies

05:20.921 --> 05:23.724
would put us five
blocks from here at
the elementary school.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.827
I can't believe
you dragged me out
right before snack time.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.629
And it was
pudding day, Shelby.

05:28.629 --> 05:33.634
The only day better than
"substitute teacher playing
a movie in class" day.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.966
Ooh, let's take a time
selfie and see
what we look like.

05:37.808 --> 05:40.571
Oh, that was my
 hip-hop phase.

05:40.571 --> 05:42.312
I was pretty fly
 for a fourth grader.

05:43.814 --> 05:45.746
Why did I always
 wear pink?

05:45.746 --> 05:48.849
'Cause you looked
 heck-a dope, son.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.220

compliments.

I don't know, Bret.

06:00.290 --> 06:02.362
Boys, I...
Maybe we should ask him.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.566
Boys, I...
Maybe he doesn't
want to talk about it.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.869
Norm, what are
you doing home?

06:08.869 --> 06:11.872
Well, I just...
He doesn't want
to talk about it.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.343
I have the afternoon off.

06:13.343 --> 06:16.777
So I thought I would
come home, lie down
and close my eyes.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.809
Dad sounds sad.
Boys, your father just...

06:18.809 --> 06:21.782
I think he misses
his work friends.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.415
I don't think he...
Let's cheer him up, Bret.

06:24.415 --> 06:26.457

to the park, Chet!

football! (GRUNTING)

06:29.860 --> 06:34.364

I'm going to play football
in the park with my sons.

06:34.364 --> 06:36.897
Be careful, honey.
The boys can get
a little rough.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.531
Oh, come on, Astrid.
They're kids.
How bad could it be?

06:40.531 --> 06:44.234
It can be really bad!

06:44.234 --> 06:48.879
Norm, you're responding
to a question you asked
before you left the house.

That's the last
thing I remember.

06:51.381 --> 06:53.514

get hurt when you
play with them?

06:53.514 --> 06:56.917

could hurt more than
giving birth to them.

I am making a lot
of friends today.

07:30.921 --> 07:33.854

how Barry described.

loud enough we'd get fans.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.505
All right!

08:55.505 --> 08:58.008
I can't see them.
I have hair in my eyes.

09:05.816 --> 09:07.347
What are you guys doing?

is changing the face of rock.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.053

Uh, former pizza guy.
I quit to join
Heart Rocket.

When I called my manager,
Glenn, to tell him I was
out of the pizza game,

09:31.602 --> 09:33.043
he quit too.

09:33.043 --> 09:35.806

manager of our band.

changed their whole lives.

of color in Barry's hair

09:49.790 --> 09:52.823
but still, this is terrible.

09:52.823 --> 09:54.725

everything for the better.

greatest band.

to all your science stuff?

I hate science.

10:23.293 --> 10:26.056
Ever since I met my
former "hero," Dr. Fleming,

10:26.056 --> 10:29.129
I shared some of my
scientific theories with
him and he patronized,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.101
mocked and
castigated me.

10:31.101 --> 10:32.933

Bring that up!

10:53.353 --> 10:55.886
Why'd you girls do that?
Why'd you girls!

10:55.886 --> 10:57.657
Why'd you girls!
Why'd you...

11:01.591 --> 11:06.336
Norm, the boys feel
really bad about how banged
up you got playing football.

11:06.336 --> 11:07.938
We feel really bad.

11:07.938 --> 11:10.140
About how
banged up you got.

11:11.441 --> 11:13.804
So we're just gonna
let you stay here and nap

11:13.804 --> 11:16.046
and I'll go have father-son
time with the boys.

11:16.046 --> 11:19.009
No, no, no, I want to
spend time with you guys.

11:19.009 --> 11:20.781
Maybe football
was a little rough,

11:20.781 --> 11:22.913
but there are plenty of other
things we can do together.

11:22.913 --> 11:24.614
Like softball.
And mini-golf.

11:24.614 --> 11:28.719
And lunch.
From a well-reviewed
restaurant!

11:28.719 --> 11:31.621
The only thing that
could hurt is my wallet.
(LAUGHING)

11:33.964 --> 11:35.295
Oh, we laugh.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.999
Let's go.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.000
I'll take pictures.

11:53.243 --> 11:59.089
I can't believe I got
injured doing softball,
mini-golf, and lunch.

11:59.089 --> 12:01.691
I mean, I went to college
on a lunch scholarship.

12:01.691 --> 12:05.625
That was just
a meal plan, Norm.

12:05.625 --> 12:09.559
On the bright side, I posted
those pictures online and
you've become a meme.

12:09.559 --> 12:12.362
Failure to Lunch.

12:12.362 --> 12:14.364

12:38.328 --> 12:40.530

12:40.530 --> 12:42.232
All right, so what's
the game plan?

12:42.232 --> 12:44.164
Oh, so that's what
goes on in huddles?

12:44.164 --> 12:47.868
I always thought it was
more of a casual side hug.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.901
I'm starting to think that
Barry was right about this
whole butterfly effect thing.

12:50.901 --> 12:53.173
Their music is terrible.
We've ruined their lives.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.146
Calm down. Plenty of
people have terrible
bands in high school.

12:56.146 --> 12:58.708
It's not like this band
is their whole life.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.610
It's official.
We're dropping
out of high school

13:00.610 --> 13:02.512
to make this band
our whole life.

13:02.512 --> 13:04.184
ALL: Yeah!

13:04.184 --> 13:06.186
I'm with you, Barry.
I've been with this guy

13:06.186 --> 13:08.218
ever since I met him
on my first day of school.

13:08.218 --> 13:11.221
I get it. I'll never be
as close as you two. Man!

13:13.864 --> 13:16.026
Shelbs, huddle up.

13:16.026 --> 13:19.900
What's the game plan, Cyd?
'Cause that's what
you do in huddles.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.973
They're dropping out
of school. This is
worse than we thought.

13:22.973 --> 13:25.475
We have to go back in
time and keep Barry from
meeting Dr. Fleming,

13:25.475 --> 13:28.278
make sure he doesn't
turn out like this.

13:28.278 --> 13:31.141
Sorry, Heart Rocket,
time for you
guys to never exist.

13:31.141 --> 13:33.583
ALL: Aw!
Wait, what?

13:38.048 --> 13:40.090
And you said
I couldn't eat 10
butterscotch puddings.

13:40.090 --> 13:42.292
I said you
shouldn't eat 10
butterscotch puddings.

13:42.292 --> 13:43.553
Oh, that makes sense, then.

13:46.056 --> 13:48.458
Okay, we have to keep
Barry from getting in
and meeting his hero,

13:48.458 --> 13:52.102
no matter what happens.
Whatever it takes.
We cannot fail.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.137
Aw, shuds!

13:57.137 --> 13:58.438
Well, that was easy.

14:03.413 --> 14:08.348

Do I ask them to leave?

14:19.029 --> 14:22.032
I choose neither.

14:22.032 --> 14:24.834
We didn't reverse
the butterfly effect.
We made it worse.

14:24.834 --> 14:29.639
And where did he get
that fake accent?
Ball-jankistan?

14:29.639 --> 14:33.243
This accent is the only
voice that matches
my internal bleakness.

14:33.243 --> 14:35.375
Even my flatulence
has lost hope.

Shelby and Cyd.

14:52.262 --> 14:55.525
Forget it, we butterfly

even know who we are.

14:55.525 --> 14:59.669
I know who you are,
neighbor girl and
neighbor girl's friend.

14:59.669 --> 15:01.771
At least I think
that's who you are.

15:01.771 --> 15:05.805
I purposely wear the wrong
prescription. I find the
eye strain challenging.

15:07.877 --> 15:11.511
If Barry's like this,
I wonder what
happened to Naldo.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.943
Barry, where's Naldo?

15:12.943 --> 15:14.614
Why would I know
where he is?

15:14.614 --> 15:16.616
We have nothing to
do with each other.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.048
Aren't you guys friends?

15:18.048 --> 15:22.222
I have no friends. Ha!
Pardon me, that was a burp.

15:22.222 --> 15:26.326
Even my belches
have disdain for
your silly questions.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.428
We need to go back
and fix whatever we did.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.932
We can't live in a world
where burps are has
and farts are whys.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.464
But we don't
know what we did.

15:34.464 --> 15:36.366
Why go back and risk
making things worse

15:36.366 --> 15:38.238
if we don't even
know what to look for?

15:38.238 --> 15:41.641
If a man were to eat
his own stomach,
would he be full?

15:41.641 --> 15:44.814
These are the things
that I think about.

15:48.418 --> 15:51.721
Come on, Dad.
You said we could do
timber sports with you.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.387
I know I banged my
head a few times today,

15:57.387 --> 16:01.561
but there is absolutely
no way I said anything
about timber sports.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.763
Maybe we said that
to each other, Bret.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.335
That does sound
like us, Chet.

16:06.966 --> 16:07.998
Take a knee, boys.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.942
Guys, I've always had
a good time with you,

16:12.942 --> 16:14.844
but we're all
getting older.

16:14.844 --> 16:17.507
And one of us
can't keep up.

16:17.507 --> 16:22.182
You got to take better
care of yourself, Bret.

16:22.182 --> 16:26.456
No, no, no. I'm saying
we just can't roughhouse
the way we used to.

16:26.456 --> 16:30.290
Maybe our days of playing
together like when you
were little are over.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.822
We just wanted to
spend time with you.

16:32.822 --> 16:35.595
We were so excited
you were home.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.768
I like spending time
with you guys, too.

16:38.768 --> 16:40.800
I'll figure out something
where I won't get hurt.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.002
I have an idea of
what we can do, Chet.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.374
I like it already, Bret.

16:47.037 --> 16:51.481
Oh! Boys, wait.
I can't get up.

16:51.481 --> 16:54.614
Wow, hearing it out
loud makes it real.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.496
It's relaxing and
won't hurt you.

17:06.496 --> 17:08.998
I know. I was here
the whole time you
were setting up.

17:08.998 --> 17:10.530
Can someone
please help me?

17:15.365 --> 17:19.108
See? This seaweed wrap
doesn't hurt, does it?

17:19.108 --> 17:23.613
Nope. Doesn't hurt.
Smells like a mermaid's
porta potty.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.346
Where did you get it?

17:26.346 --> 17:29.619
From the docks.
I got to ride a tugboat.

17:30.950 --> 17:34.084
Just leave it on
for 45 minutes.

17:34.084 --> 17:38.358
And your skin will
be seaweed smooth.

17:39.689 --> 17:44.894
Oh, Norm, you smell
like an oyster's armpit.

17:44.894 --> 17:49.499
Yep. I just figured out a way
to spend a whole hour with
the boys without getting hurt.

17:49.499 --> 17:54.504
Smell like a manatee's
jock strap, but it
made them happy.

17:54.504 --> 17:58.448
That's so sweet.
When you're done,
hose off in the yard.

17:58.448 --> 18:01.751
You smell like
squid diarrhea.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.819
Huh! Naldo, there you are.

18:09.819 --> 18:11.121
We've been looking for you.

18:11.121 --> 18:13.263
Why? Am I lost?
Ugh, not again.

18:14.724 --> 18:17.527
We need to talk to
you about why Barry
is the way he is.

for preventing me from
meeting Dr. Fleming.

18:25.405 --> 18:29.108

your creations to
fall under my control.

But look at
the joy on my face.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.529
Naldo, we need to figure
out what's going on here.

19:19.529 --> 19:21.991
Why didn't you and Barry
become friends on your
first day of school?

19:21.991 --> 19:24.294
All I remember from
that day is I got
on the wrong bus

19:24.294 --> 19:25.965
and ended up at the
high school by mistake,

19:25.965 --> 19:28.698
and there were a lot
of kids there to see
some famous scientist.

19:28.698 --> 19:30.670
But I don't remember
anything about Barry.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.672
Now can you please
help me down from here?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.544
Don't worry.
Once we go back
and change the past,

19:34.544 --> 19:37.677
this you will never
get wedgied because
you'll cease to exist.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.748
Cool. Wait, what?

19:40.980 --> 19:43.283
Get this, the day
Barry and Naldo met

19:43.283 --> 19:45.485
is the same day
we went back and
messed around with.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.217
We must have prevented
them from meeting somehow.

19:47.217 --> 19:48.588
Oh, we need to go
back and fix it.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.890
And quick, because
Burnt Popcorn-Bot
is about to...

19:58.498 --> 20:00.199
Aw, shuds!

20:00.199 --> 20:03.633
Okay, so far so good.
But where's Naldo?

20:03.633 --> 20:04.734

20:04.734 --> 20:06.236
How do we know for sure?

20:06.236 --> 20:07.777
Hi, I'm Naldo.

20:07.777 --> 20:10.179
Also, he's wearing a hat.

20:10.179 --> 20:12.812
Floor pudding! Score!

20:12.812 --> 20:15.385
I need a spoon.

20:15.385 --> 20:17.487
The Science Club
will pay for this.

20:17.487 --> 20:20.250
They set me on a path
to supervillain-hood.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.752
Look. If it wasn't for
that floor pudding cup,

20:22.752 --> 20:24.524
they would've
noticed each other.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.195
That's where they were
supposed to have met.

20:26.195 --> 20:28.528
So that how we
butterfly effected.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.929
All we have to do is
go back and pick up

20:29.929 --> 20:31.831
the pudding cup
before Naldo gets it.

20:31.831 --> 20:35.805

20:53.623 --> 20:56.286
Hi, there.
You seem sad.

20:56.286 --> 20:57.927
Do you like salt
and vinegar chips?

20:57.927 --> 21:02.732
Yes, I do.
We're gonna be
good friends.

21:02.732 --> 21:05.765
Hey, I can help
you with the whole
supervillain thing.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.598
You know something,
suddenly being
a supervillain

21:08.598 --> 21:10.900
doesn't seem so
important anymore.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.742
I'm Naldo.
I'm Barry.

21:12.742 --> 21:14.774
Is Naldo short
for Renaldo?

21:14.774 --> 21:17.877
No.
From now on, it will be.

21:21.110 --> 21:23.513
Our work here is done.

21:23.513 --> 21:26.556
If we go back to the present
and somehow Barry and Naldo
are turned into vampires,

21:26.556 --> 21:27.787
I say we just...
Let 'em turn us.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.718
...stake 'em in the heart.

21:28.718 --> 21:31.491

21:31.491 --> 21:33.923
The butterfly effect
is the phenomenon in
which small actions

21:33.923 --> 21:35.725
lead to big consequences.

21:35.725 --> 21:37.196
A butterfly
flapping its...
Yeah, yeah, we get it.

21:37.196 --> 21:38.668
We already learned
our lesson.

21:38.668 --> 21:40.770
You guys butterfly
effected something?

21:40.770 --> 21:42.432
I cannot believe
you would be so
irresponsible...

21:42.432 --> 21:44.604
Barry, relax,
everything's fine.

21:44.604 --> 21:47.437
It's not like
I grew a third
nipple or something.

21:47.437 --> 21:49.278
Whoa! A third nipple?

21:49.278 --> 21:50.740
Oh, it just a pepperoni.

21:53.112 --> 21:56.516
Renaldo, that third
nipple talk has
calmed my fury.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.448
Once again, your
cool head prevailes.

21:58.448 --> 22:00.450
My cool head's
why I wear a hat.

22:02.352 --> 22:04.253
It's kind of sweet
how Naldo's friendship

22:04.253 --> 22:06.456
keeps Barry from
going off the deep end.

22:06.456 --> 22:08.057
Hey, Barry, we're
out of orange juice.

22:08.057 --> 22:10.329
Can I drink this?
Nope, that will
make you explode.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.461
Okay.

22:11.461 --> 22:14.263
And Barry keeps
Naldo alive.
