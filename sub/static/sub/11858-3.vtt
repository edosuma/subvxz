WEBVTT

00:21.583 --> 00:24.917
- Get in the car, home-girl!
- Yeah, it's party time, yo!

00:25.000 --> 00:26.417
They're here!

00:30.291 --> 00:31.834
You don't have to go, Anna.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.917
Not every Amish person
leaves for Rumspringa.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.166
Mom.

00:37.250 --> 00:39.000
That's why you never
got to see the ocean

00:39.083 --> 00:41.000
like you always wanted.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.125
Today is my birthday.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.875
I'm-I'm-I'm 16.

00:44.959 --> 00:46.583
I didn't forget.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.750
It's soil from the garden.

00:52.834 --> 00:54.291
So you won't forget
where home is.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.291
Couldn't find any sand.

00:56.375 --> 00:59.041
Don't worry, mom.
I'm gonna see the real
ocean.

01:02.041 --> 01:04.875
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:15.542 --> 01:16.667
Get in, get in.

01:18.458 --> 01:20.625
Put this in. It's great.

01:20.709 --> 01:21.834
Write to me every day.

01:21.917 --> 01:23.083
Tell me what it's
like out there.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.417
Every single day!
I promise.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.083
Whoo! Let's do it.

01:41.083 --> 01:43.041
How fast can you get us
to the train station?

01:43.125 --> 01:44.166
The train station?

01:44.250 --> 01:46.333
We're going
to Philadelphia, Rachel.

01:46.417 --> 01:48.166
Philadelphia?
That's a city.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.667
A big city.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.125
The bigger, the better.

01:58.583 --> 01:59.458
Anna.

03:14.166 --> 03:16.000
(Vera)
'City kicked in
for some new windows.'

03:16.083 --> 03:19.166
Only took them
five months.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.375
Nice not having
that constant reminder.

03:23.166 --> 03:27.083
Heard IAD came by last week
and...talked to Scotty.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.709
Yeah, he talk to you
anything about it?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.792
- No.
- 'You're detectives.'

03:30.875 --> 03:32.417
Right?

03:34.583 --> 03:36.959
- And you are?
- Sarah Gunden.

03:37.041 --> 03:38.834
My sister Anna
disappeared a year ago.

03:38.917 --> 03:41.750
We deal in homicides,
not missing persons.

03:41.834 --> 03:43.333
She wrote to me every day.

03:43.417 --> 03:45.125
Just like she promised.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.083
And then her
letters
just stopped.

03:50.709 --> 03:52.458
And what was your sister
doing in Philly?

03:52.542 --> 03:55.959
She came here on Rumspringa.
Mine started today.

03:56.041 --> 03:58.458
Rumspringa. That's that
Amish-kids-gone-wild thing?

03:58.542 --> 04:01.750
The day we turn 16,
all rules stop.

04:01.834 --> 04:03.458
We're allowed to go
into the world.

04:03.542 --> 04:06.291
Do English things...
till we decide to go back.

04:06.375 --> 04:07.834
Maybe your sister
liked our ways better.

04:07.917 --> 04:09.333
Anna wouldn't have
just disappeared

04:09.417 --> 04:11.875
without telling
me.
I just know.

04:13.875 --> 04:15.625
Something happened to her.

04:19.166 --> 04:22.875
Last one's dated
August 20, 2006.

04:22.959 --> 04:24.333
It's a Kensington postmark.

04:24.417 --> 04:26.625
Ain't exactly the
tea-and-crumpets part of town.

04:26.709 --> 04:28.083
You know who she was
staying with?

04:28.166 --> 04:29.458
Her friend.

04:29.542 --> 04:30.834
She didn't use names.

04:30.917 --> 04:32.834
Anna ever have
any broken bones?

04:32.917 --> 04:35.125
Dental work?
Something to identify her?

04:35.208 --> 04:37.667
She's missing a
tooth
in the back.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.000
The way our
dentist
fixes cavities.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.083
Is there a number
we can reach you?

04:45.583 --> 04:46.667
Verkler's?

04:46.750 --> 04:47.792
It's a farm supply store

04:47.875 --> 04:49.375
down the road
from my home.

04:49.458 --> 04:50.500
They'll find me.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.875
How? Smoke signals?

04:55.625 --> 04:56.875
You're not
staying in Philly?

04:56.959 --> 04:59.625
The only reason I
care
about Rumspringa..

04:59.709 --> 05:01.709
...is to find out
what happened to my
sister.

05:06.208 --> 05:09.250
Amish kid in Philadelphia.

05:09.333 --> 05:10.709
A babe in the woods.

05:10.792 --> 05:12.917
Should've stayed
where she belonged.

05:48.542 --> 05:50.792
(Valens)
Talked to IAD.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.959
'Guy's a real
son of a bitch.'

05:53.041 --> 05:54.709
(Stillman)
'No kidding.'

05:54.792 --> 05:56.750
Yeah, and he knew about
the Burrell job..

05:56.834 --> 05:59.250
...what went down,
and for the life of me

05:59.333 --> 06:02.250
I can't figure out
how he found out about that.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.917
I don't know either.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.458
A lot of smoke and
mirrors,
these investigations.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.250
Sure about that, boss?

06:11.792 --> 06:14.583
You want to
rephrase
that, Scotty?

06:14.667 --> 06:16.750
Is that in my file?

06:16.834 --> 06:18.792
Vigilante dad
tried
to kill Burrell

06:18.875 --> 06:21.792
based on info
you gave him.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.417
You think no one's
gonna figure that
out?

06:23.500 --> 06:25.792
Are you saying...
everyone knows?

06:25.875 --> 06:27.583
Your own fault, Scotty.

06:29.208 --> 06:30.333
You screwed up.

06:40.375 --> 06:41.834
No shortage of Jane Does

06:41.917 --> 06:43.834
in the City of Brotherly Love.

06:43.917 --> 06:48.041
What happens when you got 406
homicides in a calendar year.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.041
Here's something.

06:49.125 --> 06:50.875
16-to-18-year-old female.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.041
Missing molar.

06:52.125 --> 06:53.500
DOD between August 10

06:53.583 --> 06:55.500
and September 10, 2006.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.166
The postmark date
of
Anna's last letter
fits.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.750
City demolition crew found
her body in the basement

07:00.834 --> 07:03.000
of an abandoned apartment
building in Kensington.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.375
Emerald Street.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.333
Surface
abrasions
on her heels.

07:06.417 --> 07:08.834
Carpet fibers.
Well, she was dragged
there.

07:08.917 --> 07:11.834
I'll check real estate
files for owners.

07:11.917 --> 07:14.625
Cause of death is
a five-inch serrated knife.

07:14.709 --> 07:15.709
Ouch.

07:15.792 --> 07:17.250
No signs of sexual trauma.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.542
No drugs or alcohol
in her system.

07:19.625 --> 07:20.667
And no suspects.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.750
Case went cold
almost from day one.

07:22.834 --> 07:24.041
What's an Amish girl doing

07:24.125 --> 07:25.625
in an abandoned
apartment
building

07:25.709 --> 07:27.166
in Kensington?

07:27.250 --> 07:29.291
Dressed like this.

07:29.375 --> 07:31.291
'That don't look
so Amish to me.'

07:31.375 --> 07:34.041
Maybe she runs out of
money,
turns to the streets?

07:34.125 --> 07:35.417
Gets killed by a John?

07:35.500 --> 07:37.458
Roller coaster Rumspringa.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.208
We get anything from
those letters she wrote?

07:39.291 --> 07:41.667
Nah, just the typical
teenage angst.

07:41.750 --> 07:44.875
Kid that age, ain't easy
survivin' a brand-new
culture.

07:44.959 --> 07:47.542
And you would know?

07:47.625 --> 07:51.709
My dad...he came here
from Cuba when he was 15.

07:51.792 --> 07:53.834
This type of thing
changes a person.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.667
We, uh...Photoshop
her picture

07:59.750 --> 08:02.709
with Amish clothes,
recirculate it, maybe get
lucky.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.959
Well, who's going
to Lancaster..

08:05.041 --> 08:06.959
...see if the family
can make an ID?

08:07.041 --> 08:09.834
I hear the Amish don't like
outsiders too much.

08:09.917 --> 08:11.834
Not into chasing some
horse and buggies?

08:13.333 --> 08:14.625
Hell, no.

08:16.792 --> 08:18.500
No, don't look at me.

08:18.583 --> 08:19.709
So, who's going?

08:23.208 --> 08:24.917
What the hell these
people do all day?

08:25.875 --> 08:27.792
'No TV, phone.'

08:27.875 --> 08:30.208
'Place is like a
Colonial day reenactment.'

08:30.291 --> 08:32.875
Quit gawking.

08:32.959 --> 08:35.166
And they're looking at us
like we're the weirdoes.

08:40.542 --> 08:42.083
May I help you?

08:42.166 --> 08:43.959
Philly PD,
Mrs. Gunden.

08:46.667 --> 08:47.834
We're here about
your daughter.

08:47.917 --> 08:49.750
You found Anna?

08:49.834 --> 08:51.291
You brought these
outsiders here?

08:54.291 --> 08:55.542
Where is my sister?

08:55.625 --> 08:57.792
We have a photo
we'd like you to look
at.

08:57.875 --> 08:59.667
For identification purposes.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.875
Identification purposes?

09:01.959 --> 09:03.500
A Jane Doe.

09:03.583 --> 09:06.458
A girl without a name.

09:06.542 --> 09:07.834
We think it might be her.

09:19.125 --> 09:22.125
We'd like to ask a few
questions
about the day she left.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.625
No.

09:23.709 --> 09:25.250
Ma'am?

09:25.333 --> 09:29.125
Whatever...happened
to my daughter..

09:29.208 --> 09:31.583
...it was God's will.

09:31.667 --> 09:33.250
It's not our place
to interfere.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.959
[scoffs]
It's the Amish way.

09:37.375 --> 09:40.125
It's our job to get to
the truth of what
happened.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.500
We need your help.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.750
She left with Rachel Wagler..

09:46.834 --> 09:48.166
...her best friend.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.417
She lives down the road.

09:51.208 --> 09:53.166
I'd like to
see my daughter.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.667
We'll make arrangements
to get her back to you

09:54.750 --> 09:56.250
as soon as possible.

09:56.333 --> 09:59.041
My baby...has to come home.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.834
(Vera)
'Philly PD.'

10:10.917 --> 10:12.917
Is this Rachel Wagler's home?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.667
Yes.
She's inside.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.875
You can wait here...sir.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.542
Rachel?

10:38.709 --> 10:40.834
I'm Detective Rush.

10:40.917 --> 10:42.041
Philly Homicide.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.583
Homicide?

10:43.667 --> 10:44.875
I don't understand.

10:44.959 --> 10:46.875
I'm here about Anna Gunden.

10:48.166 --> 10:50.625
Her family just
identified her body.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.375
Is there some way
I can help you?

10:58.458 --> 11:01.542
Understand the two of you
went to the city together.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.875
I barely even remember that.

11:03.959 --> 11:06.792
Must have been some reason
the two of you split up.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.250
I...wanted to come home.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.917
- She didn't.
- Why?

11:28.834 --> 11:30.291
Mighty quiet around here.

11:32.333 --> 11:33.750
Might want to give me a hand.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.875
You must miss her a lot.

11:44.959 --> 11:47.000
It's a real tragedy.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.083
She's better off
in the afterlife.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.959
I was talking about you.

11:52.041 --> 11:54.959
And not having your
best friend around.

11:55.041 --> 11:57.542
And she never even got
to meet your baby.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.583
Of course, I miss her.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.667
So help me find
the person who killed her.

12:06.709 --> 12:08.709
[sighs]
I hated it out there.

12:10.417 --> 12:12.750
The cars, the noise..

12:12.834 --> 12:15.792
And the people...
one minute they're happy

12:15.875 --> 12:17.625
the next they're mad.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.792
You never knew what
was gonna happen next.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.375
Anna didn't mind?

12:22.583 --> 12:24.125
No way.

12:24.208 --> 12:25.500
She loved chaos.

12:26.458 --> 12:27.750
Blasting music.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.000
No rules.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.917
What happened when you
went to the city?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.875
Anna was in heaven.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.208
But for me..

12:39.291 --> 12:40.959
...it might as well
have been another planet.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.291
Jakob!

13:10.417 --> 13:11.333
Hey!

13:12.458 --> 13:14.458
- Anna!
- No! Please!

13:21.959 --> 13:24.041
A-Amish in the house!

13:24.125 --> 13:26.709
- What's up, home-girl?
- What's up? We made it.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.709
Alright. Got's any news
from the homestead?

13:28.792 --> 13:30.375
My parents still
lame as always?

13:30.458 --> 13:33.000
Well, I haven't seen them
since
I called you from Verkler's.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.458
Yeah, no worries.

13:34.542 --> 13:36.792
So, ready to par-tay
or what?

13:36.875 --> 13:38.458
Definitely!
What about the beach?

13:38.542 --> 13:40.875
Shh. Relax,
female-lady-girl.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.166
Every damn Amish kid
want to see the ocean.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.667
First, we got's
a scene to check.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.625
- Alright? Come on.
- Okay.

13:47.709 --> 13:49.417
Did you hear
that?
A party.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.500
But...aren't you scared?

13:51.583 --> 13:52.875
Nothing's the same as home.

13:52.959 --> 13:55.083
And no one's telling
us
what to do either.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.417
"Keep your voices down, girls."

13:56.500 --> 13:58.041
"Don't be so proud, girls."

13:58.125 --> 13:59.250
It's hard to
figure out who you
are

13:59.333 --> 14:00.542
when you're just
following rules.

14:00.625 --> 14:02.750
- You promise to stay close?
- Yes.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.166
And if you get
scared,
just remember

14:04.250 --> 14:06.083
"Life is not
a dress
rehearsal."

14:16.542 --> 14:19.417
I wish I could
take it all back.

14:19.500 --> 14:22.625
Say I never cracked a beer,
tried other things.

14:22.709 --> 14:24.750
This Jakob character..

14:24.834 --> 14:26.375
...he Anna's connection
to the city?

14:26.458 --> 14:27.709
He left during Rumspringa

14:27.792 --> 14:31.166
and decided not
to be Amish anymore.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.166
He loved the
English
world.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.583
Couldn't understand why
anyone
would want to come back.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.458
And you girls
were staying with him?

14:37.542 --> 14:38.959
At his apartment.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.750
Recall where that was?

14:42.333 --> 14:45.625
- Frankford Avenue.
- In Kensington?

14:45.709 --> 14:48.083
He said that was his hood.

14:48.166 --> 14:49.208
Why?

15:00.583 --> 15:02.709
You ready to go?

15:02.792 --> 15:04.625
[clearing throat]
Yeah, let's get outta
here.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.458
(Jeffries)
'Had me fooled, homeboy.'

15:27.542 --> 15:30.166
Never would've pegged
you for Amish.

15:30.250 --> 15:33.291
Amish? I-I said goodbye to
those backward folks forever.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.792
So you're English
to the core now?

15:36.875 --> 15:37.875
Word.

15:37.959 --> 15:39.500
Got me a PlayStation

15:39.583 --> 15:42.166
'250 channels
of satellite TV'

15:42.250 --> 15:44.208
and a fridge full of 40s.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.583
Yeah...that your bait..

15:46.667 --> 15:48.583
...luring Amish
girls out to their death?

15:50.417 --> 15:51.875
I didn't kill Anna.

15:51.959 --> 15:53.542
I was helpin' her out.

15:53.625 --> 15:56.125
She wanted in, I took her
to all the dope places.

15:56.208 --> 15:58.291
This relationship sexual?

15:58.375 --> 15:59.834
Man, she was Amish!

15:59.917 --> 16:01.834
You think I mess around
with farm-raised tail?

16:01.917 --> 16:03.417
You talk that way
around your mother?

16:06.792 --> 16:08.458
I'm just sayin'..

16:08.542 --> 16:10.875
...maybe I could've eased
her
into the scene gentle.

16:10.959 --> 16:13.125
You know, given her
a chance to
accumulate.

16:15.125 --> 16:16.458
Anna..

16:16.542 --> 16:18.709
...get herself into trouble
her first night out?

16:18.792 --> 16:22.375
[clicks tongue]
Nah, that was my bad.

16:22.458 --> 16:24.250
Girl had no business
being in that punk's crib

16:24.333 --> 16:25.959
and I should've knew it.

16:37.542 --> 16:40.208
- Rachel still won't wake up.
- Word!

16:40.291 --> 16:42.250
One adult beverage,
that whale is beached.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.083
I promised I'd
look out for her.

16:44.166 --> 16:46.166
I don't even know how long
she's been passed out up
there.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.333
[laughs]
It ain't your
fault

16:48.417 --> 16:50.583
female-lady-girl
slams her booze.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.041
Now, you ready
to
party or what?

16:58.291 --> 17:00.250
What the hell's
Vince coming over
for?

17:00.333 --> 17:02.250
- Who's that?
- You don't want to know.

17:02.333 --> 17:03.542
He's crazy.

17:03.625 --> 17:06.542
Hope it's cool, uh,
I heard about your party.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.125
Name is Jakob.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.959
- Damaged freak.
- I'll be back.

17:25.041 --> 17:27.250
Yo!
What the hell you doing?

17:27.333 --> 17:28.667
Living!

17:33.083 --> 17:34.917
Girl had some
kinda death wish.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.291
I should've looked out
for her better.

17:37.375 --> 17:40.000
- Well, what about that
knife?
- Big-ass thing.

17:40.083 --> 17:42.625
You know, with them
nasty jags on the side.

17:42.709 --> 17:43.959
Freak always had it on him.

17:44.041 --> 17:45.458
Is that right?

17:45.542 --> 17:47.500
Word on the street is that
he did some time in juvie

17:47.583 --> 17:49.041
for stabbing a kid to death.

18:16.917 --> 18:18.792
This isn't your thing, right?

18:18.875 --> 18:20.041
Therapy.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.333
Talking.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.000
Uh, I gotta
put in my
hours.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.333
Standard protocol.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.041
Right.

18:29.458 --> 18:30.542
'Your daughter?'

18:32.583 --> 18:33.959
Yes.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.417
Her name is Jessica.

18:39.667 --> 18:43.125
If you just want to, you
know,
fill out the paperwork.

18:43.208 --> 18:44.583
Say I was here?

19:06.291 --> 19:08.750
- Okay.
- 'Lilly?'

19:08.834 --> 19:10.291
There's a reason
it's required

19:10.375 --> 19:12.375
to talk to someone
after a shooting.

19:12.458 --> 19:13.667
Sure.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.583
A traumatic event
like that, yeah.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.709
Are you having
any trouble sleeping?

19:17.792 --> 19:18.875
Nightmares?

19:20.750 --> 19:21.792
No.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.250
Okay.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.834
See you next week.

19:40.667 --> 19:43.000
- Looks like him right here.
- Yeah.

19:43.959 --> 19:45.417
Vince Patrielli?

19:47.041 --> 19:49.417
- Who's asking?
- Philly PD.

19:51.750 --> 19:52.959
Son of a bitch!

19:58.333 --> 20:00.500
- Wanna try it again, dumbass?
- I didn't do nothing!

20:00.583 --> 20:02.375
- So why you running?
- Felt like a workout.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.000
And I checked
your juvie
records.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.542
Ain't nothing about
you knifing a guy.

20:05.625 --> 20:07.917
Bunch of bull to make you
seem like a badass.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.083
You off Anna Gunden to
prove
you were some kind of man?

20:14.208 --> 20:17.208
- She's dead?
- Aw, nice touch.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.291
Hustler like you,
acting like you give a crap

20:19.375 --> 20:20.500
about the Amish girl?

20:20.583 --> 20:22.083
It ain't like
you think it was.

20:22.166 --> 20:25.125
Then clue us in,
'cause the meter's running.

20:25.208 --> 20:27.583
She may have looked Amish..

20:27.667 --> 20:29.125
...but she sure
didn't act like it.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.125
I have a spot like this too.

20:58.542 --> 21:01.208
I have six
brothers
and sisters.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.166
Louder than tornadoes.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.500
I bet it's even
better
up on the roof.

21:06.583 --> 21:08.417
Ain't getting up there
in that muumuu.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.500
So fix it.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.291
Make me look
English,
not Amish.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.458
My clothes, they're..

21:14.542 --> 21:15.583
Stupid.

21:18.166 --> 21:19.542
Fix them.

21:20.333 --> 21:22.375
With this.

21:31.834 --> 21:34.583
How do you know
I won't do more?

21:34.667 --> 21:35.834
Like cut you?

21:37.625 --> 21:39.291
(Anna)
'Because you believe in God.'

21:42.583 --> 21:44.208
Yeah, right.

21:45.709 --> 21:48.625
If God exists, he was taking
work off the day I was born.

21:52.875 --> 21:54.875
Your parents don't
live here, do they?

21:54.959 --> 21:56.458
What's you problem?

21:56.542 --> 21:59.166
I just meant you're
alone,
aren't you?

22:01.500 --> 22:02.542
Maybe.

22:04.417 --> 22:06.291
So, why do you have
a spot like this?

22:07.917 --> 22:09.583
Guess I just don't
like people much.

22:12.667 --> 22:14.208
Maybe I was
waiting for you.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.375
Turn.

22:44.583 --> 22:46.250
- I look..
- Sick.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.542
You can't tell I'm Amish?

22:48.625 --> 22:49.709
No way.

22:52.166 --> 22:53.417
Well, maybe a little.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.458
We partied together 24/7..

23:13.542 --> 23:15.917
...maybe two, three weeks.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.875
Then she split.

23:17.959 --> 23:18.959
No goodbye, nothing.

23:19.041 --> 23:20.834
That's a nice story, Vince.

23:20.917 --> 23:22.250
Your summer of love.

23:22.333 --> 23:25.458
Those Amish kids,
they always go back, right?

23:25.542 --> 23:26.625
I thought
that's what happened.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.208
Where'd this knife
of yours go?

23:28.291 --> 23:29.583
Someone stole it.

23:30.542 --> 23:32.542
Around the time
Anna took off.

23:32.625 --> 23:34.417
Didn't seem like
an odd coincidence?

23:34.500 --> 23:37.500
Not till you telling me
she's dead.

23:39.208 --> 23:40.959
- Can I go now?
- Nah.

23:41.041 --> 23:42.542
I think I'll hang on
to you for a while.

23:44.792 --> 23:46.875
Valens.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.792
Yeah, right.

23:48.875 --> 23:51.792
Pharmacist in
Kensington
ID'd Anna's photo.

23:51.875 --> 23:53.500
(male #1)
'She came into the store
about a year ago'

23:53.583 --> 23:55.834
but she wasn't the one
sporting the Amish-wear.

23:55.917 --> 23:57.208
She was with a friend?

23:57.291 --> 23:58.583
Yeah, kind of a mousy girl.

23:58.667 --> 24:00.750
Brown hair,
maybe five foot three.

24:00.834 --> 24:03.542
- Sounds like Rachel Wagler.
- Mm.

24:04.750 --> 24:07.125
And Anna was the one
wearing normal clothes?

24:07.208 --> 24:08.792
I don't know if you'd
call them normal.

24:08.875 --> 24:11.834
The dress was all ripped up,
kind of dirty looking.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.875
But you know kids these days.

24:13.959 --> 24:15.333
You have a
pretty
good memory.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.959
I remember
all my shoplifters.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.417
This color is sick.

24:26.500 --> 24:29.000
- Don't you think?
- Sick?

24:29.083 --> 24:31.917
- You should hear yourself.
- What's wrong?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.375
Are you mad at me
or something?

24:33.458 --> 24:35.083
(Rachel)
'I want to go home.'

24:35.166 --> 24:38.291
We're just
starting
to have fun.

24:38.375 --> 24:40.208
You mean you and Vince.

24:42.291 --> 24:45.417
Well, I think
I'm..
You know.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.208
What, in love?

24:47.291 --> 24:49.500
Why are you
acting like
this?

24:49.583 --> 24:52.458
God, why did I
listen to you?

24:52.542 --> 24:53.709
About coming here?

24:53.792 --> 24:55.291
We didn't want
any more rules.

24:55.375 --> 24:57.125
You didn't want rules.

24:57.208 --> 24:59.750
I like rules.
I like being Amish.

24:59.834 --> 25:02.125
It's not my fault nothing's
good enough for you.

25:02.208 --> 25:03.417
Alright, young lady.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.583
- I didn't do anything.
- I was talking to her.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.125
I knew you wouldn't
pay for that.

25:11.041 --> 25:12.583
A pregnancy test?

25:15.333 --> 25:18.417
But...who was it?

25:18.500 --> 25:20.750
If you tell anyone,
I'll kill you.

25:20.834 --> 25:23.083
I swear, Anna,
I'll kill you.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.333
Wouldn't usually expect
the dowdy one to have

25:28.417 --> 25:29.709
the sticky fingers, but..

25:29.792 --> 25:32.083
You press charges?

25:32.166 --> 25:35.375
Girl in a predicament
like that, Amish and all..

25:35.458 --> 25:37.709
I figured she had
enough problems.

25:37.792 --> 25:40.250
Well, her problems
just got a whole lot worse.

25:44.625 --> 25:47.667
So, if Rachel's pregnant
in August '06.

25:47.750 --> 25:50.542
What's term...40 weeks?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Don't look at me.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.208
Well, maybe this son of hers

25:54.291 --> 25:55.875
ain't so Amish after all.

25:55.959 --> 25:57.250
(Vera)
'If you want to split
hairs'

25:57.333 --> 25:58.667
her kid won't decide
if he's Amish

25:58.750 --> 26:00.041
till after Rumspringa.

26:02.291 --> 26:04.125
Thanks.

26:04.208 --> 26:05.667
Been needing one of these.

26:05.750 --> 26:08.000
Yeah, I heard
about shop class, Nick.

26:08.083 --> 26:09.250
You going native on us?

26:09.333 --> 26:10.834
You should take
a trip out there.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.667
No, thanks.

26:12.750 --> 26:14.500
(Vera)
'You ever notice
when the power goes out'

26:14.583 --> 26:16.667
all the buzzing stops?

26:16.750 --> 26:18.417
Streetlights, refrigerators

26:18.500 --> 26:21.166
'stuff you didn't even
know makes noise?'

26:21.250 --> 26:24.041
That's what it's like.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.000
Pure silence.

26:26.083 --> 26:27.834
He is goin' native.

26:30.375 --> 26:33.000
So, Rachel gets back
to the farm pronto.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.667
Passes the kid off
as her new husband's.

26:35.750 --> 26:36.625
Mose.

26:36.709 --> 26:37.667
And no one's the wiser

26:37.750 --> 26:39.166
unless Anna threatens to tell.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.417
Now that's a secret
worth killing for.

26:45.208 --> 26:46.333
We're a happy family.

26:46.417 --> 26:48.291
Why can't you just
leave us alone?

26:48.375 --> 26:49.959
If you'd been straight
with me the first time

26:50.041 --> 26:51.000
I wouldn't be here.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.792
I answered your questions.

26:52.875 --> 26:54.166
Forgot the part where
you got pregnant

26:54.250 --> 26:55.375
on Rumspringa?

26:59.792 --> 27:01.917
- I didn't mean to lie.
- Course not.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.709
I didn't want to talk about
the worst night in my life.

27:04.792 --> 27:06.709
Night you killed Anna
to keep her quiet?

27:06.792 --> 27:09.041
"Tell anyone,
and I'll kill you."

27:09.125 --> 27:12.375
- Your words.
- I was scared.

27:12.458 --> 27:14.166
She wouldn't have
told anyone.

27:14.250 --> 27:17.834
- You've got motive, no
alibi--
- We were like blood!

27:17.917 --> 27:21.208
We came from the same place.

27:21.291 --> 27:24.000
It was the English
who were heartless.

27:27.959 --> 27:29.792
I can't believe
I'm gonna see the ocean.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.083
And the ocean's
gonna see you.

27:33.166 --> 27:34.375
Come on, let's just go.

27:34.458 --> 27:35.709
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

27:35.792 --> 27:38.166
Are you sure?

27:38.250 --> 27:39.125
Just go.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.333
My God.

27:52.417 --> 27:53.917
It's so beautiful.

28:07.041 --> 28:08.667
Anna?

28:10.333 --> 28:12.917
I'm sorry what I
said to you.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.959
- I was scared.
- Did you take the test?

28:16.041 --> 28:17.333
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.834
Have you ever seen
water so big?

28:24.917 --> 28:27.875
Just the pond behind
the schoolhouse.

28:27.959 --> 28:31.125
Do you think there's
another world out
there?

28:31.208 --> 28:33.208
Something better
than this one?

28:33.291 --> 28:36.125
I don't know. I..

28:36.208 --> 28:38.125
I doubt it.

28:38.208 --> 28:41.417
Rachel, if you tell me
who it is, maybe I can
help.

28:43.542 --> 28:46.000
[laughing]
What's up, home-girls?

28:46.083 --> 28:49.208
Don't even say Jakob
doesn't deliver, bitches!

28:49.291 --> 28:50.834
Look at this scene!

28:50.917 --> 28:53.083
You're wasted.
always

28:53.166 --> 28:55.959
[laughing]
I wanna be English forever!

28:56.041 --> 28:58.291
Being Amish sucks!

28:58.375 --> 29:00.291
Amish say they helpin',
but they ain't.

29:00.375 --> 29:03.583
Livin' in the 1600's,
all pious and crap.

29:03.667 --> 29:06.000
Can't tell me
what to do no more.

29:08.166 --> 29:09.959
Wait..
You and Jakob?

29:10.041 --> 29:13.333
- No.
- Then who?

29:18.792 --> 29:19.834
Vince.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.333
What?

29:23.417 --> 29:24.625
It was Vince.

29:24.709 --> 29:26.834
But..

29:26.917 --> 29:28.375
...how could you do that?

29:28.458 --> 29:30.208
I didn't do anything.
He did.

29:30.291 --> 29:31.417
I was drunk.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.542
You promised to stay close,
but you didn't.

29:35.917 --> 29:39.000
And all I can see is
his face on top of me.

29:39.083 --> 29:41.333
The night we got to Philly?

29:41.417 --> 29:44.875
He's not the person
you think he is, Anna.

29:44.959 --> 29:46.208
None of them are.

30:06.458 --> 30:08.542
Anna thought that monster

30:08.625 --> 30:10.375
was her knight
in shining
armor.

30:10.458 --> 30:12.041
And the baby?

30:12.125 --> 30:14.208
I asked Anna to come
home with me..

30:16.792 --> 30:18.041
but she said she
wasn't gonna let
him

30:18.125 --> 30:19.291
get away with it.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.625
Will you testify
against him?

30:24.792 --> 30:25.875
My husband..

30:25.959 --> 30:29.000
...loves my boy
like his own.

30:29.083 --> 30:30.959
Please, don't make me.

30:36.041 --> 30:38.917
You know, how did I know I'd
be
talkin' to you again, bitch?

30:39.000 --> 30:41.375
Don't know.
Woman's
intuition?

30:41.458 --> 30:42.625
Yeah?

30:45.250 --> 30:47.000
Enough!

30:47.083 --> 30:48.458
Scotty.

30:52.917 --> 30:56.417
It wasn't all hunky-dory
with you and Anna like you
said.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.250
Unless...raping her
best friend

30:58.333 --> 30:59.583
is part of your
courting ritual.

30:59.667 --> 31:00.750
You got a son out there.

31:00.834 --> 31:02.083
Boy doesn't know
who you are.

31:07.792 --> 31:09.542
Cry me a river.

31:09.625 --> 31:11.500
Kid's living
on some sunny-day farm.

31:11.583 --> 31:13.083
You're going away for this.

31:13.166 --> 31:14.750
You saying that Amish
loser's gonna hop on
her

31:14.834 --> 31:16.208
horse and buggy
and testify?

31:16.291 --> 31:18.125
She already agreed to it.

31:18.208 --> 31:19.375
Said she's been
living for the day

31:19.458 --> 31:21.041
she takes you down.

31:21.125 --> 31:23.458
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

31:23.542 --> 31:25.375
I just bit first this time.

31:25.458 --> 31:28.500
(Stillman)
'We're talking about more than
rape charges here, Vince.'

31:28.583 --> 31:30.083
Try murder one.

31:31.542 --> 31:34.041
I told you...
I didn't kill
Anna.

31:34.125 --> 31:35.834
She knew what you
did to Rachel.

31:35.917 --> 31:38.834
She called you out,
didn't she?

31:38.917 --> 31:41.166
Girl like that..

31:41.250 --> 31:42.583
...she wasn't
afraid
of anything.

31:42.667 --> 31:43.792
Not even you.

31:50.333 --> 31:52.333
For a while, I..

31:52.417 --> 31:55.125
...thought it could
have been different.

31:55.208 --> 31:57.250
You know..

31:57.333 --> 31:59.250
[clicks tongue]
...if I met her
sooner.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.834
Like before you
raped her best friend.

32:03.792 --> 32:05.750
Bottom line is,
Anna wanted to go home.

32:08.291 --> 32:09.625
(Vince)
'What's with the silent
treatment all the way'

32:09.709 --> 32:11.500
from the shore?

32:11.583 --> 32:13.000
Anna, come on.
What's with you?

32:13.083 --> 32:15.125
I thought I knew you.

32:15.208 --> 32:16.834
I thought you were special.

32:16.917 --> 32:17.959
You do know me.

32:18.041 --> 32:19.750
She told me, alright?

32:21.750 --> 32:22.959
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.625
Rachel..

32:24.709 --> 32:26.583
I know what you did to her.

32:26.667 --> 32:28.583
It was just a joke,
'cause she's lame and all.

32:28.667 --> 32:29.834
'Somebody dared me.
It was dumb.'

32:29.917 --> 32:31.250
I-I didn't
even
know you
yet.

32:31.333 --> 32:33.583
I can't believe
how stupid I was.

32:33.667 --> 32:35.166
Believing in you and me

32:35.250 --> 32:38.125
and-and thinking
it was fate.

32:38.208 --> 32:39.250
- Anna, come on.
- Don't!

32:39.333 --> 32:40.834
Just don't!

32:41.875 --> 32:43.834
Grow up, Amish bitch.

32:43.917 --> 32:45.709
This is the real world.

32:45.792 --> 32:48.208
Everyone was
right about you.

32:48.291 --> 32:49.917
You are a damaged freak.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.208
Yeah, but you're the pathetic
whore who came begging for it!

32:52.291 --> 32:54.166
- You're hurting me!
- 'Anna!'

32:57.000 --> 32:58.041
Mom?

33:11.375 --> 33:13.166
So, Anna's mother was there?

33:15.583 --> 33:17.542
She forgot to tell us
about this field trip.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.500
Next thing you
know,
Anna's dead.

33:20.792 --> 33:22.792
Wouldn't be the first
Christian to kill.

33:43.291 --> 33:46.333
Isn't losing my
daughter
punishment enough?

33:46.417 --> 33:47.542
Not if you killed her.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.917
Lying to us about
being in Philly..

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
...makes us think you did.

33:51.083 --> 33:53.291
And if I told you..

33:53.375 --> 33:54.959
...would that have
brought Anna back?

33:55.041 --> 33:57.709
Your daughter was trying
to figure out a lot of things

33:57.792 --> 33:59.625
while on Rumspringa.

33:59.709 --> 34:02.750
To be or not to be Amish.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.125
Tough question
to answer at that age.

34:06.208 --> 34:10.792
But...it looks like she was
starting to figure it out.

34:10.875 --> 34:12.208
"I see mom

34:12.291 --> 34:14.542
"practically locked
in the kitchen

34:14.625 --> 34:17.417
"raising seven children,
and I don't know

34:17.500 --> 34:20.125
if that's what I want
from my life."

34:20.208 --> 34:21.917
You were losing her.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.291
You couldn't let
that happen.

34:23.375 --> 34:25.625
The example she'd be
setting for Sarah..

34:25.709 --> 34:26.792
...your other daughters.

34:26.875 --> 34:28.834
Something Anna used to say..

34:28.917 --> 34:29.959
"Life is not--"

34:30.041 --> 34:31.542
"A dress rehearsal."

34:35.375 --> 34:37.834
I saw that on a..

34:37.917 --> 34:40.709
...bumper sticker.

34:40.792 --> 34:43.792
I knew Anna would
appreciate it.

34:43.875 --> 34:46.000
She was..

34:46.083 --> 34:48.625
...everything
I wanted to
be..

34:49.417 --> 34:50.542
...but couldn't.

34:52.750 --> 34:54.291
She was..

34:54.375 --> 34:56.333
...fearless.

34:56.417 --> 34:59.083
Strong.

34:59.166 --> 35:01.542
Anna's death..

35:01.625 --> 35:04.917
...was my fault.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.250
I should have
let her come
home.

35:13.834 --> 35:15.208
(Anna)
'Why did you come here?'

35:16.667 --> 35:20.250
I heard Rachel came
back,
so I went to see her.

35:20.333 --> 35:23.500
And then I was
worried about
you.

35:23.583 --> 35:25.500
Why?

35:25.583 --> 35:27.333
A woman doesn't have seven
babies without knowing

35:27.417 --> 35:29.375
what a pregnant
girl
looks like, Anna.

35:31.208 --> 35:34.917
I thought there was
something for me here.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.542
But I was wrong.

35:37.417 --> 35:38.583
I'm coming home with you.

35:41.208 --> 35:43.291
- Mrs. Gunden?
- Jakob.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.917
Do my parents know
that you're here?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Did they send you?

35:48.083 --> 35:50.792
I thought maybe they
were
worried or something.

35:50.875 --> 35:52.417
My mom, maybe?

35:54.542 --> 35:55.834
Mom?

35:55.917 --> 35:57.083
He's talking to you.

35:57.166 --> 35:59.041
Jakob Beachy is in ban.

35:59.125 --> 36:01.417
'We are forbidden
to talk to him.'

36:06.792 --> 36:08.250
Goodbye, Mrs. Gunden.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.542
Tell my folks
I miss them, okay?

36:22.291 --> 36:23.834
This is for you.

36:24.792 --> 36:26.667
It's real sand.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.375
You saw the ocean?

36:34.291 --> 36:36.041
I know you think
there's some..

36:36.125 --> 36:38.125
...big world
beyond it or whatever.

36:38.208 --> 36:39.917
But..

36:40.000 --> 36:41.458
...it was just pretty.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.500
That's all it was.

36:44.583 --> 36:46.000
Are you sure?

36:46.834 --> 36:48.291
Did you really look?

36:52.875 --> 36:55.959
I don't want you to come
home out of fear, Anna.

36:57.375 --> 37:00.083
I've seen people give up.

37:00.166 --> 37:01.333
But never you.

37:03.291 --> 37:05.542
Why are you saying
these things?

37:07.375 --> 37:09.125
It's like you
want me to stay.

37:09.208 --> 37:11.500
I never had the chance.

37:13.875 --> 37:16.959
But there is
another
world out there.

37:17.041 --> 37:20.750
A world much bigger..

37:20.834 --> 37:23.291
...than this one.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.208
You just have
to
really look.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.875
All this time

37:34.959 --> 37:37.667
I thought she'd
found
something better.

37:39.208 --> 37:40.542
But I was wrong.

37:42.250 --> 37:45.250
You said Jakob Beachy
was banned?

37:45.333 --> 37:47.375
Excommunicated.

37:47.458 --> 37:50.583
But still, he'd come
back late at nights

37:50.667 --> 37:52.250
on drugs.

37:52.333 --> 37:55.166
Begging to be let back.

37:55.250 --> 37:58.792
And so the church
gave him an
ultimatum.

37:58.875 --> 38:01.000
Which was what?

38:01.083 --> 38:03.834
Clean up his act for good or..

38:03.917 --> 38:05.500
...never come back again.

38:11.959 --> 38:13.458
So Jakob gets hooked.

38:13.542 --> 38:16.000
Has no idea
what to do about it.

38:16.083 --> 38:18.041
What happens when you
send your 18th century
kid

38:18.125 --> 38:21.000
into a 21st century world?

38:21.083 --> 38:23.208
Do you want
to take a ride?

38:23.291 --> 38:25.041
Where are we going?

38:25.125 --> 38:27.125
Chase some horse
and buggies.

38:40.375 --> 38:41.750
Fools got me on LoJack?

38:41.834 --> 38:44.500
Ain't hard to find
someone in your shoes.

38:44.583 --> 38:47.375
Easiest place to
score in Kensington.

38:47.458 --> 38:49.917
You're a far cry
from home, huh, Jake?

38:53.333 --> 38:56.000
You know,
my family's from
Cuba.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.792
You know where that is?

38:57.875 --> 38:59.000
Yeah, I guess.

39:02.166 --> 39:04.125
Guy named Castro..

39:04.208 --> 39:07.083
...takes over, 1959.

39:07.166 --> 39:09.250
Throws anyone
who objects in jail.

39:09.333 --> 39:11.208
Or worse.

39:11.291 --> 39:12.917
My family's one
of
the lucky ones.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.375
'But no matter how long
they've been in this
country..'

39:16.458 --> 39:19.208
...it still ain't...home.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.250
You spend New Year's Eve
with any Cuban..

39:23.333 --> 39:25.041
...you hear them
give the toast.

39:25.125 --> 39:26.959
<i>"El año que viene en Cuba."</i>

39:28.834 --> 39:31.375
"Next year in Cuba."

39:31.458 --> 39:34.500
But...1959?

39:37.458 --> 39:38.917
You do the math.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.500
Been waiting a long time.

39:41.875 --> 39:43.625
You tell me your life story..

39:43.709 --> 39:45.041
...I'll tell you mine?

39:46.709 --> 39:48.208
I'm thinking they're
one
and the same.

39:48.291 --> 39:50.375
I mean, you lost your home

39:50.458 --> 39:53.250
your family,
everything you've ever known.

39:53.333 --> 39:56.250
I know what that
does to a person.

39:56.333 --> 39:58.125
How it makes them feel inside.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.208
'Lost.'

40:04.208 --> 40:05.709
So you pretended
to love the English world

40:05.792 --> 40:09.041
'but...deep down
you were scared.'

40:12.500 --> 40:15.583
I just wanted to go home so bad.

40:15.667 --> 40:18.417
They want you to come home,
Jakob, your parents.

40:21.458 --> 40:22.542
They do?

40:22.625 --> 40:24.333
I just talked to them.

40:24.417 --> 40:25.917
They miss you too.

40:28.417 --> 40:30.709
Yeah, just like
Anna's parents miss her.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.458
I didn't mean to hurt her.

40:39.041 --> 40:41.583
She had a chance
to get out of this place.

40:42.417 --> 40:45.083
And hear the quiet again.

40:45.166 --> 40:47.417
But she didn't even care.

40:54.083 --> 40:55.500
Jakob?

40:55.583 --> 40:57.250
What's wrong?

40:57.333 --> 40:59.041
- Where's your mother?
- She went home.

40:59.125 --> 41:02.000
How come you get
to go home, and I
don't?

41:02.083 --> 41:03.667
Why don't they love me too?

41:03.750 --> 41:05.125
I'm not going home.

41:05.208 --> 41:08.166
- Just stop lying.
- I changed my mind.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.500
I'm gonna do Rumspringa
the way we're supposed to.

41:10.583 --> 41:13.041
I don't care.

41:13.125 --> 41:15.125
I just wanna go home.

41:15.208 --> 41:17.375
You can. You've just got
to quit partying.

41:17.458 --> 41:19.166
I don't know how!

41:21.417 --> 41:23.000
I'm gonna go back with you.

41:23.083 --> 41:24.667
You're gonna tell
my folks I'm
better.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.083
You're gonna tell them
that I stopped doing bad
things.

41:27.166 --> 41:28.375
They'll believe you.

41:28.458 --> 41:31.125
- I'm not going back.
- No, you have to!

41:31.208 --> 41:34.208
- It's the only way.
- No..

41:34.291 --> 41:35.709
Stop!

41:35.792 --> 41:37.709
Jakob, I'm going.

41:37.792 --> 41:39.000
Get out of my way.

41:45.041 --> 41:46.375
Oh!

41:47.166 --> 41:48.166
'Come on.'

41:48.250 --> 41:50.458
Stand up.

41:50.542 --> 41:53.542
We're gonna go home.
We're gonna go home.

41:53.625 --> 41:55.542
We're gonna go home.
No, no..

41:56.792 --> 41:58.333
We're gonna go home.

42:01.709 --> 42:03.917
We're gonna go home.
We're gonna go home.
