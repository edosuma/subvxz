It was definitely my records?

Yeah.

- She asked about me in class?
- Oh, well, she was just taking attendance.

15:07.472 --> 15:11.170
So when you weren't there,
she asked the class if anyone knew you.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.110
- So she's looking for me.
- I don't know what's going on, Michael.

15:14.179 --> 15:17.376

- Thanks.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.474
- Sure.
- Listen.

Not the candy, Einstein.

Liz, I don't think
you should do this, okay?

23:14.624 --> 23:16.683
I mean, we don't know
what can happen. I mean...

23:16.759 --> 23:19.057
the guy touched you,
and you saw into his soul.

23:19.129 --> 23:21.063
How do we know what happens
if he kisses you?

23:21.131 --> 23:24.499
How do we know what it is to be
kissed by a Czechoslovakian? You don't.

23:24.567 --> 23:27.093
Okay, Maria, no one
is kissing anyone here.

23:27.170 --> 23:30.470
I mean, Max isn't even
the least bit interested in me.

23:30.540 --> 23:32.804
He said that things werejust
like they used to be before.

23:32.876 --> 23:36.278
Nothing's changed.
He said that.

23:36.346 --> 23:40.214
Oh, my God. It's not just kissing
that goes on in the eraser room, Liz.

23:40.283 --> 23:42.615
She's got that right.

23:42.685 --> 23:44.779
All right, the eraser room
does two things-

23:44.854 --> 23:47.551
cleans erasers
and takes our innocence.

23:47.624 --> 23:50.594
Do you know what I mean by
“takes our innocence,“ Liz?
