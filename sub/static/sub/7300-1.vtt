02:39.034 --> 02:41.412
Let's go!

02:43.163 --> 02:45.336
Everybody in!

02:46.124 --> 02:48.110
All right, you guys okay?

02:48.210 --> 02:50.929
All right, go! Go!

04:05.287 --> 04:07.689
He's going out and burning
all the evidence!

04:07.789 --> 04:10.025
- Urgent! Urgent!
- I want to go!

04:10.125 --> 04:11.902
Where's Lin? Lin Braddock.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.028
She left.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.722
- Do you know where she went?
- I don't know.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.748
Lin, is your man
really taking you to America?

04:24.848 --> 04:27.522
Yes, of course.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.469
What about all this?

04:37.569 --> 04:39.854
I can't take everything.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.381
What about this?

05:14.481 --> 05:17.360
Please, take it. Take anything you want.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.971
Stay back! Stay back!

05:21.071 --> 05:22.973
I can't lift you!

05:23.073 --> 05:25.121
Visas first!

05:25.283 --> 05:28.645
I can't help you all! We have no room!

05:28.745 --> 05:31.022
Captain, has a Lin Braddock
come to the gate?

05:31.122 --> 05:34.568
If you work for the embassy,
have your papers ready!

05:34.668 --> 05:39.174
If you work for the embassy,
have your papers ready!

05:39.339 --> 05:40.323
Not yet, Colonel.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.617
- You're a friend of Lin?
- I'm her husband.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.139
She went to her home!

05:44.302 --> 05:45.370
When?

05:45.470 --> 05:49.350
One hour, maybe two.
She had to get her papers.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.527
The dress is so beautiful! Thank you!

06:02.821 --> 06:05.348
Good-bye, Mimi. Take care.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.870
Bye.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.311
Yeah!

07:58.228 --> 07:59.963
- Hold it.
- We found her upstairs.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.815
Do you know her?

08:06.778 --> 08:09.122
My God.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.258
Guess what I've got.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.338
- All right, hit it!
- Roger!

10:29.629 --> 10:33.033
I said, get the hell off of here!

10:33.133 --> 10:35.010
I can't find her!

10:39.097 --> 10:42.959
I'm Lin Braddock! Look at the list!

10:43.059 --> 10:45.482
I work for the embassy!

10:45.645 --> 10:47.130
Lin Braddock!

10:47.230 --> 10:48.447
- Captain!
- What is it?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.449
She says she's on the list.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.761
- What name?
- Lin Braddock!

10:52.861 --> 10:55.221
I'm a translator for the embassy!

10:55.321 --> 10:58.683
- Give me your papers!
- I lost them! They stole them!

10:58.783 --> 11:00.435
- Please! Look at the list!
- Oh, come on.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.353
I need your papers!

11:02.453 --> 11:06.399
I told you, somebody stole them!
You have to believe me, please!

11:06.499 --> 11:08.401
Well, there's nothing I can do about that!

11:08.501 --> 11:11.237
- Please, look at the list!
- Wait a minute.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.740
Colonel Braddock... This morning,
you were supposed to be here?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.387
Yes!

11:26.895 --> 11:28.397
Get them down!

11:41.993 --> 11:43.836
Stand aside! Move!

11:45.413 --> 11:49.668
Come on, Junior, get these down!
Hold him back!

11:51.878 --> 11:53.721
Get off me! Get out of the way!

11:54.797 --> 11:56.299
Move!

12:05.016 --> 12:06.417
Let's go!

12:06.517 --> 12:12.445
Please! Wait, stop! Please!

12:14.776 --> 12:18.531
Wait, please! Please!

12:19.948 --> 12:21.541
Please!

12:35.922 --> 12:38.050
Keep your heads down. Don't crowd.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.787
Commander, please!
I give you a thousand dollars!

12:42.887 --> 12:45.606
Please! I love America! Come on!

12:45.765 --> 12:48.484
Hey! Let me go up!

12:57.110 --> 12:58.436
Hey!

12:59.404 --> 13:00.872
Let me go! Hey!

13:03.491 --> 13:04.993
Hey, take off!

13:12.625 --> 13:14.527
Don't worry, we got you, Colonel!

13:14.627 --> 13:15.737
Make space! Nice and easy.

13:15.837 --> 13:19.032
- There you go, Colonel, it's okay.
- Get him in.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.475
All right, move 'em out! Move!

14:25.740 --> 14:26.992
- Hi, Cindy.
- Hey.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.844
I should run for president.

14:29.944 --> 14:31.604
- What did you say?
- I didn't think...

14:31.704 --> 14:33.263
Oh, really?

14:55.561 --> 14:58.881
- Mr. Braddock?
- That's right.

14:58.981 --> 15:02.110
Colonel James Braddock?

15:03.528 --> 15:06.657
- What can I do for you?
- Could I have a few moments of your time?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.410
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

15:15.289 --> 15:19.135
Please, could we please talk
more privately?

15:22.338 --> 15:23.990
Yeah, sure.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.933
Thank you.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.690
Here you go.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.133
Would you like something to drink?

15:42.233 --> 15:43.509
No, no, thank you.

15:43.609 --> 15:48.389
I'm Reverend Polanski from the Amerasian
Children's Mission in Vietnam.

15:48.489 --> 15:52.101
Officially, I come to this country
to raise funds for the mission.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.354
I was hoping I could find you
before I went back.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.627
Find me. Why?

15:57.415 --> 16:00.651
About a year ago, a young Amerasian child

16:00.751 --> 16:03.654
came to the mission, begging for help.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.324
He told me that his mother was sick.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.159
I went to see if there was
anything I could do

16:08.259 --> 16:12.288
and found out she worked
for the U.S. Embassy during the war.

16:12.388 --> 16:16.814
She has been severely punished
by the Vietnamese Government.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.921
Having a half-American son,
it made things even worse for her.

16:20.021 --> 16:24.217
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
but what's that got to do with me?

16:24.317 --> 16:29.514
The woman's married name is
"Mrs. James Braddock."

16:29.614 --> 16:31.140
What did you say?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.518
I'm talking about your wife, Mr. Braddock.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.837
- Lin Tan Cang.
- You're mistaken.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.939
No, there is no mistake.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.274
My wife died during the fall of Saigon.

16:40.374 --> 16:43.069
Your wife is alive. I know her quite well.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.988
Your son's name is Van.
He's now 12 years old.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.157
My wife and I didn't have a son.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.285
Why is it so hard for you to believe me?

16:51.385 --> 16:54.247
Because I saw my wife's body
burnt to a crisp, that's why!

16:54.347 --> 16:57.125
You may have seen a body,
but it wasn't your wife!

16:57.225 --> 17:00.104
Lin Tan Cang is alive!

17:01.521 --> 17:05.465
Believe whatever you want, Reverend.
I know better.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.443
Your few moments are up.

17:23.041 --> 17:27.488
Even if you did believe me, I doubt
if there's anything you could do.

17:27.588 --> 17:31.492
I've already gone to the State Department,
and they will do nothing.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.765
But I had to let you know.

17:34.845 --> 17:39.316
Good-bye, Mr. Braddock. God be with you.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.318
Braddock?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.341
C.I.A.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.222
Please come with us.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.139
Wait outside.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.412
It's been a long time, Colonel Braddock.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.934
How've you been?

19:00.097 --> 19:02.771
You know how I've been, Littlejohn.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.983
Now, what do you want?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.739
You just met with a Reverend Polanksi.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.383
So?

19:10.483 --> 19:14.095
Did he tell you some kind of crazy story

19:14.195 --> 19:16.664
about your wife being alive?

19:21.202 --> 19:22.374
Is that a crazy story?

19:22.536 --> 19:24.209
Of course it is!

19:32.254 --> 19:34.882
Big mistake, Littlejohn.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.807
I didn't believe it until now.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.443
What are you going to do
about getting them out?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.396
Nothing.

19:48.562 --> 19:52.442
If I don't get them out,
they're going to die.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.995
People die every day.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.604
Braddock! I'm warning you.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.334
Don't step on any toes.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.840
I don't step on toes, Littlejohn.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.552
I step on necks.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.768
Welcome to Bangkok.

20:43.868 --> 20:48.089
We hope you enjoyed your flight
and will fly with Thai Airlines again.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.682
Take me downtown.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.070
40 baht, please.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.860
Now, look here, mate,
I said I need more room.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.018
Now, beat it!

21:38.881 --> 21:41.325
Oh, well, you're strong!

21:44.136 --> 21:47.060
Woo, you can take me home!

21:48.974 --> 21:50.476
You want to try knocking me off?

21:51.727 --> 21:53.650
How the hell are you, Braddock?

21:54.396 --> 21:55.631
Did you get everything?

21:55.731 --> 21:57.967
Oh, geez.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.844
Yes, I got everything!

21:59.944 --> 22:01.762
But it sure as hell wasn't easy.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.014
That's why I appreciate it, Mik.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.809
That's what friends are for, Braddock.

22:06.909 --> 22:09.583
Which reminds me, got my money?

22:18.087 --> 22:19.822
- Let's go.
- No, no, no!

22:19.922 --> 22:23.134
No need to hurry! The plane
won't be loaded for several hours yet.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.018
We got a long drive out of town.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.436
Oh, shit, here comes trouble.

22:33.727 --> 22:37.356
- Go get the car and pull out front.
- Agh, okay.

22:38.816 --> 22:39.800
Hey!

22:39.900 --> 22:42.094
You're not going anywhere, Mikelchyk.
Take him to the car.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.806
Geez! Hey, loosen up a little bit!
Watch my beer, man!

22:45.906 --> 22:49.956
I warned you, Braddock,
not to fuck with us.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.980
Don't try to stop me, Littlejohn.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.926
You're stopped. Come on.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.974
Freeze, asshole, or you're dead!

23:21.150 --> 23:22.652
Excuse me, girls!

23:24.028 --> 23:24.950
Braddock!

23:33.579 --> 23:37.049
Cut him off! Cut him off! Braddock!

23:44.214 --> 23:45.615
Braddock!

23:48.636 --> 23:50.559
Stop right there.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.402
Braddock, freeze!

24:31.679 --> 24:32.726
You actually made it!

24:35.474 --> 24:37.450
- Uh-oh.
- Shit!

24:45.526 --> 24:47.620
Get in your cars and go after him! Hit it!

24:48.445 --> 24:50.243
Oh, no!

24:58.706 --> 25:00.754
Way to go, man!

25:25.399 --> 25:30.012
Jesus, Braddock! Couldn't you have
lined up just a... just a teeny bit?

25:30.112 --> 25:32.014
I mean, I got to live here!

25:32.114 --> 25:34.333
You've got a one-way ticket out!

25:34.491 --> 25:36.459
Oh! Ah!

25:56.638 --> 25:58.464
Jesus, Braddock!

25:59.224 --> 26:01.022
Hey, watch it!

26:09.026 --> 26:10.243
Whoa!

26:12.404 --> 26:14.702
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

26:25.918 --> 26:27.886
Hey!

26:38.013 --> 26:40.040
Oh, shit, Braddock!

26:40.140 --> 26:43.877
We'll have the whole damn
police force after us!

26:43.977 --> 26:45.254
How far is it to the plane?

26:45.354 --> 26:47.715
It's quite a ways out of Bangkok.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.614
No, it'll be daylight before we get there.

27:01.411 --> 27:05.041
Get us going, man!

27:06.208 --> 27:08.757
Let's go, let's go!

27:17.511 --> 27:19.121
Are you sure this thing
will get off the ground?

27:19.221 --> 27:21.415
Oh, relax!

27:21.515 --> 27:24.209
Sit back, enjoy the ride!

27:24.309 --> 27:25.982
It's like Coney Island.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.650
Ah...

27:58.343 --> 28:01.163
Okay, Braddock.

28:01.263 --> 28:05.250
Are you gonna tell me where we're
going now, as if I didn't know?

28:05.350 --> 28:09.105
Along the coast. Qan Rai Bay.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.968
We're going to have to skim the waves
when we get there,

28:15.068 --> 28:17.412
to stay underneath their radar.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.939
Hey, Braddock, you've clone some flying.

28:27.039 --> 28:30.734
Why don't you take the controls, eh?
Give me a rest.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.508
Let's see if you can fly
as well as you can drive, eh?

28:33.670 --> 28:36.115
- It's been a long time.
- You can do it.

28:36.215 --> 28:41.016
I tell you, it's a lot calmer up here
than it is in your automobile.

28:48.143 --> 28:52.089
You know, when we get to the drop zone,
I'm gonna pull her up into a climb,

28:52.189 --> 28:55.843
and you'll have about five seconds to make
the drop before I put her into a dive.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.220
I'll need ten seconds.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.414
Well, if you're a good boy,
I'll give you ten seconds.

29:05.869 --> 29:09.940
Vietnam. I never thought
I'd be coming back.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.338
I guess we never really can leave, can we?

29:14.503 --> 29:17.473
Oh, come on, get your ass
back there. I'll take it.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.928
Okay, Braddock, you've got 30 seconds!

29:52.874 --> 29:55.002
Good luck, mother.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.402
See you in hell, you crazy bastard.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.720
Come on!

33:36.890 --> 33:40.815
Let us each give thanks in our own way.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.245
Amen.

33:55.492 --> 33:58.061
Thank you Father, wise and good,

33:58.161 --> 34:01.606
for home, and friends, and daily food.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.443
Bless, dear Lord, the food we take,

34:04.543 --> 34:06.216
and keep us all...

34:07.796 --> 34:09.342
Oh, my God!

34:12.132 --> 34:16.036
And keep us all home and safe.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.706
Amen.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.683
Amen.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.571
Please start without me.
I'll be right back.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.597
Braddock!

34:33.697 --> 34:35.348
How on earth did you get here?

34:35.447 --> 34:37.851
- Where's my wife?
- She doesn't live very far.

34:37.951 --> 34:39.351
Can you tell me how to get there?

34:39.452 --> 34:41.420
I'll take you there.

34:41.955 --> 34:44.940
Here. Wear this.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.295
There is a curfew.
We must be very careful.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.776
I tried to tell you how bad it was.

35:03.852 --> 35:05.587
You'd better go, Reverend.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.047
And thanks.

35:07.147 --> 35:08.381
Good luck.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.575
And God bless you.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.691
I didn't know. I thought you were...

36:49.791 --> 36:52.510
It's not important.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.489
I prayed you would come for us.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.575
And you are here.

36:58.675 --> 37:02.179
That is all that matters to Van and I.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.569
This is your son, Jim.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.196
Hello, Van.

37:14.816 --> 37:16.551
Van...

37:16.651 --> 37:18.574
I speak English, Braddock!

37:21.322 --> 37:25.018
For years, he dreamed about you.

37:25.118 --> 37:28.521
Sometimes, in very difficult moments,

37:28.621 --> 37:31.983
I would find him talking to you
as if you were there.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.612
And somehow you
would make things right for him.

37:35.712 --> 37:39.491
But one day, he stopped believing.

37:39.591 --> 37:43.662
I tried to keep you alive in his heart.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.560
I tried.

37:54.564 --> 37:58.068
I guess I know how you feel, Van.

37:58.735 --> 38:00.553
Thinking that I deserted you
and your mother.

38:00.653 --> 38:03.827
But... I want you to know that...

38:04.032 --> 38:05.784
Van, please!

38:07.076 --> 38:12.440
If I'd known that you
and your mother were alive,

38:12.540 --> 38:14.087
there's nothing in the world
that would have stopped me

38:14.250 --> 38:16.469
from coming for you before now.

38:39.359 --> 38:41.657
You've suffered so much.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.792
I know I have changed, Jim.

38:49.536 --> 38:53.712
I'm sorry I am no longer pretty for you.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.049
You'll always be beautiful to me.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.978
We have to go now.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.444
We are ready.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.383
Let me check the street first.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.228
Van, hurry!

41:28.569 --> 41:30.412
Come on!

41:32.448 --> 41:34.246
Hurry, hurry!

41:53.344 --> 41:54.846
The boat's right down there.

42:07.734 --> 42:10.803
It might be a tight squeeze, but I think
you're going to enjoy the ride, Van.

42:10.903 --> 42:13.452
If you say so, Braddock!

42:16.826 --> 42:18.169
Please be patient.

42:19.078 --> 42:21.898
We've only had each other for 12 years.

42:21.998 --> 42:24.092
And now...

42:25.752 --> 42:28.947
It is very difficult for him.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.970
He will need some time.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.768
We have all the time in the world.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.558
I love you very much, James Braddock.

43:00.203 --> 43:03.582
I think I should talk to our son
for a moment.

43:04.248 --> 43:05.795
I'll go get the boat ready.

43:12.340 --> 43:14.308
Van.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.831
Van, all right.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.184
Everything will be all right.

43:22.350 --> 43:24.794
You don't care about me now.

43:24.894 --> 43:26.146
You only care about him!

43:26.896 --> 43:28.673
That is not true.

43:28.773 --> 43:31.676
It is our love that brought you
into this world.

43:31.776 --> 43:34.053
Your father loves you as I do.

43:34.153 --> 43:37.056
If you will only give him a chance.

43:37.156 --> 43:39.830
Please try, Van.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.767
Mama... I'm very scared.

43:59.428 --> 44:01.977
I know you are.

44:02.765 --> 44:07.003
But once we get to America,
everything will be better,

44:07.103 --> 44:09.071
I promise.

44:12.233 --> 44:14.802
Your father promises.

44:14.902 --> 44:16.495
Lin, we have to get out of here! Hurry!

44:42.847 --> 44:44.123
Foolish.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.795
Very foolish to come back.

44:48.895 --> 44:52.149
I am General Quoc.

44:54.358 --> 44:57.220
How do you do, Madame Braddock?

45:00.656 --> 45:03.643
And this must be your son, Van.

45:03.743 --> 45:05.620
Very good-looking boy.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.441
When I received the report

45:10.541 --> 45:14.195
that a strange-looking boat
had outrun my gunboats

45:14.295 --> 45:16.739
and heading towards Ho Chi Minh City,

45:16.839 --> 45:22.411
I took the privilege of assuming
it was you, Colonel Braddock,

45:22.511 --> 45:26.958
since Reverend Polanski had just
returned from your country.

45:27.058 --> 45:31.359
But now, Braddock...

45:33.231 --> 45:37.844
...you must pay for the crimes
that you have committed

45:37.944 --> 45:40.367
against my beloved country.

45:40.780 --> 45:42.515
They have nothing to do with this.

45:42.615 --> 45:46.791
You are absolutely right.

45:54.126 --> 45:55.548
No!

45:55.711 --> 45:59.056
Mom!

47:03.362 --> 47:08.619
You will find your first test
quite challenging.

47:13.205 --> 47:14.707
Out!

48:29.198 --> 48:34.170
Usually we use people
who are a little bit taller.

49:04.775 --> 49:07.470
I have tested many before, Braddock,

49:07.570 --> 49:11.474
and no one has lasted even an hour.

49:11.574 --> 49:14.685
Maybe you can be the first, eh?

49:14.785 --> 49:17.229
I'll do whatever you want.

49:17.329 --> 49:19.548
Just let the boy go.

49:21.584 --> 49:27.216
You will do what I want anyways.

51:10.901 --> 51:12.845
Well done.

51:12.945 --> 51:14.472
Well done, Colonel Braddock.

51:14.572 --> 51:18.918
You are every bit as tough
as your reputation.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.603
I like that.

51:20.703 --> 51:22.922
I like that!

51:36.885 --> 51:39.388
You have not disappointed me, Braddock.

52:31.815 --> 52:33.783
No!

52:39.740 --> 52:42.914
This has gone on long enough!

55:44.842 --> 55:46.640
Braddock!

55:50.097 --> 55:52.976
- Van!
- I'm in here!

55:54.726 --> 55:56.820
Let's go, come on!

56:34.808 --> 56:36.668
- Can you make it?
- Yeah.

56:36.768 --> 56:38.770
Go to the mission.

57:32.032 --> 57:33.955
Braddock!

59:17.763 --> 59:20.248
What's wrong? What are you doing?

59:20.348 --> 59:22.626
Where is Braddock?

59:22.726 --> 59:24.399
Where is Braddock?!

59:24.561 --> 59:26.880
I don't know where Braddock is, General.

59:26.980 --> 59:29.841
You lie, Priest! You lie!

59:29.941 --> 59:31.885
We know you help Braddock!

59:31.985 --> 59:34.304
I? You must be mistaken.

59:39.117 --> 59:40.602
You lie!

59:40.702 --> 59:45.549
Perhaps a change of environment
will help you to think more clearly?

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:18.156
Monkey eyes. Take him!

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:23.979
Please, no! I can't leave my children!
They need me!

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:25.981
Of course!

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.816
I wouldn't want to separate you

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:32.612
from your half-breed
American bastard children!

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:36.323
Take them all! Take them all!

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:53.218
Priest, your new home
will be Go Dau Ha prison!

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:54.100
Mm?

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.172
Ow!

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:08.051
Ay! Ay!

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:10.702
No! No!

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:12.787
No!

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:17.076
No! No!

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:21.087
No! No!

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.089
No...

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:27.252
No! No!

01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:45.778
Stop! Stop!

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.488
Stop!

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:01.930
Kids, in the truck!

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:10.212
Van, where's the Reverend?

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:13.424
I know! I'll get him, Braddock!

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:26.518
Braddock! Braddock!

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.606
Come on, Reverend!

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:53.959
Thank God, Braddock!

01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:39.901
Braddock!

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:42.984
Braddock!

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.266
Heads down, children!

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.383
Reverend, get the kids out of here!

01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:05.938
Out! Hurry!
We must get away from the truck!

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:47.645
Get down, Reverend!

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:25.808
It's okay.

01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:36.201
90 kilometers to the border.

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:40.181
You don't expect these children
to walk 90 kilometers!

01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:42.704
I don't expect a damn thing, Reverend!

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:46.504
But walk or crawl, we're going to make it!

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:48.255
Come on, kids!

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:57.765
Come on, Reverend.

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:28.538
Braddock... Braddock...

01:18:32.499 --> 01:18:36.153
The children are dead tired.
We must stop to rest.

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:41.100
Please, Braddock!
They are not very strong, look.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:54.526
Wait here.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.306
Reverend! Reverend! Bring the kids! Hurry!

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:49.036
Come, come, children. Quiet. Be quiet.

01:21:58.664 --> 01:22:01.583
Braddock! Braddock!

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:17.100
Come, children! Hurry! Hurry!

01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:22.504
Come, children!

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:24.948
Be careful! Be careful!
Don't hurt yourselves!

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:28.698
Come!

01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:31.287
Go, go!

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:46.378
Come on, kids! Hurry!

01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:57.773
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry up!

01:23:05.772 --> 01:23:07.615
Thomas!

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:16.541
Hurry!

01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:33.926
Sit down and hold on!

01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:40.269
Damn it!

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.854
Come on!

01:24:23.684 --> 01:24:25.402
Hold on!

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:40.559
Braddock, I will kill you,
and I will burn your filthy children!

01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:42.409
Braddock!

01:24:56.675 --> 01:24:58.494
Hold on.

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.893
Oh, my God!

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:09.275
Get back there with the kids, Reverend.

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:13.950
It's gonna get rough.

01:25:17.237 --> 01:25:20.161
It's going to be tough.

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:47.084
Mayday, mayday!

01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:48.544
Mayday, mayday!

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:50.128
This is Colonel James Braddock,

01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:53.507
calling American Military
Assistance Command.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:57.157
Come in! Mayday, mayday!

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:00.622
Take a seat.

01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:04.810
Mayday, mayday! This is Colonel Braddock.

01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:06.958
I'm in a crippled C-47.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.940
I have a planeload of Amerasian children.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.316
Losing fuel.

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:15.011
I'm approximately 80 miles
east of the Thai border.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:18.198
If anyone can hear me,
please transfer the message

01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:21.598
to the American Military
Assistance Command.

01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:24.600
Is everyone okay back there?

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:26.811
Are you okay?

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.668
I'm fine. How are you?

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:31.941
I'm fine, too.

01:26:57.587 --> 01:26:59.906
Reverend! We're going down!

01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:02.054
Children! Get down!

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:05.938
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

01:27:14.354 --> 01:27:15.631
We're gonna die!

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:17.358
Just hold on!

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:14.631
Come on, Van.

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.425
Help the kids.

01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:14.124
Everybody down.

01:29:14.224 --> 01:29:15.771
Reverend!

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:24.676
My God! Braddock, there is the border!

01:29:24.776 --> 01:29:26.887
As soon as I take the guards out,

01:29:26.987 --> 01:29:29.615
you get the kids over the bridge
as fast as you can.

01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:33.289
Did you hear what I said?

01:30:04.357 --> 01:30:08.495
On my way over here,
I was wondering what you would be like.

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:12.536
I want you to know,
you're everything I wanted in a son.

01:30:14.117 --> 01:30:15.835
And I'm very proud of you.

01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:27.138
I love you.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.394
All right, men, let's go!

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.706
What the hell is happening, Dan?

01:31:17.806 --> 01:31:20.959
Braddock and the children.
We intercepted a radio message.

01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:23.232
They crashed somewhere near here.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.167
Oh, shit!

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.828
Van!

01:33:10.335 --> 01:33:11.211
Don't go!

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.739
I can't leave him, Dan. I got to help him.

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:16.950
Leave it alone, General. He's on his own.

01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:18.597
No one crosses the border.

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.204
All right!

01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:12.484
- Daddy!
- Don't go!

01:34:16.526 --> 01:34:17.823
Christ!

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:45.981
I got you, Braddock! I got you!

01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:47.248
Daddy!

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:49.250
- Oh, no! No, Van! Get back!
- Daddy!

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.818
Get back! No! No, please!

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:57.717
You're finished, Braddock! I've won!

01:35:12.582 --> 01:35:15.256
They will not dare to cross.

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:30.979
What's he doing?

01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:39.238
Hold your position!

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:45.415
He makes one wrong move,
we'll climb up his ass!

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:47.809
You got it.

01:35:47.909 --> 01:35:53.382
The Americans are bluffing.
They will not dare do anymore.

01:36:13.142 --> 01:36:15.440
Fire! Fire!

01:37:03.568 --> 01:37:05.241
There he is!

01:37:26.424 --> 01:37:28.097
Oh, Braddock!

01:37:30.178 --> 01:37:32.601
Thank God you're alive!

01:37:39.645 --> 01:37:41.488
Come on, children!

01:37:58.289 --> 01:38:00.166
Thank you.

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:04.304
Thank you.
