00:35.469 --> 00:39.140

01:08.202 --> 01:10.171

01:22.916 --> 01:24.118

(school bell ringing)

02:48.001 --> 02:50.204
(children laughing)

03:10.758 --> 03:13.361
(applause and cheering)

03:40.354 --> 03:42.623
(girl whining)

03:50.664 --> 03:52.700
(crowd cheering and applauding)

04:13.854 --> 04:16.423
(distorted):
Lucy?

04:16.457 --> 04:20.793
("The Washington Post March"
plays over P.A.)

04:50.858 --> 04:53.327
("TheWashington Post March"
continues)

05:25.526 --> 05:28.028
(three gunshots,
people screaming)

05:31.565 --> 05:35.403
* Uncomfortable silence

05:35.436 --> 05:39.039
* I'll kill it
if you want me to *

05:42.810 --> 05:46.113
* I'm like ultra violence

05:46.146 --> 05:50.551
* I'll kill it
if you want me to *

05:53.521 --> 05:56.957
* Out of sight, out of mind

05:56.990 --> 05:58.892
* I'm not the hurting kind

05:58.926 --> 06:01.895
* I'll make you surrender

06:01.929 --> 06:05.533
* I'll make you surrender,
I'll make you surrender *

06:05.566 --> 06:07.901
* I'll make you surrender

06:07.935 --> 06:11.071
* Stop when
the red lights flash *

06:11.104 --> 06:13.040
* I'll trade you blood
for dirty cash *

06:13.073 --> 06:16.810
(car horn beeping)

06:16.844 --> 06:21.415
* I'll make you surrender,
I'll make you surrender. *

06:51.512 --> 06:52.980
(gunshot)

07:06.527 --> 07:08.729

07:51.639 --> 07:55.909
* Out here in the fields

07:55.943 --> 07:59.847
* I fight for my meals

07:59.880 --> 08:04.618
* I get my back into my living

08:06.920 --> 08:09.022
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.230

siren briefly)

(two gunshots, glass shattering)

09:34.174 --> 09:36.176
*

09:41.649 --> 09:44.852
* Is your heart singing
out of tune? *

09:44.885 --> 09:48.856
* Are your eyes
just singing the blues? *

09:48.889 --> 09:52.793
* Dirty records
from another time *

09:52.826 --> 09:56.830
* Some bloodstains
on your shoes *

09:56.864 --> 10:01.001
* No one really knows
about your soul *

10:01.034 --> 10:04.705
* And I barely really know
your name *

10:04.738 --> 10:07.708
* Burning rhythms
and posting lies *

10:07.741 --> 10:11.111
* And a bunch of fools
drown in shame *

10:11.144 --> 10:14.815
* Amy, don't you go

10:14.848 --> 10:20.087
* I want you around

10:20.120 --> 10:23.423
* Singing, "Whoa-oa-oa,
please don't go" *

10:23.456 --> 10:27.160
* Do you want to be
a friend of mine? *

10:27.194 --> 10:31.298
* Do you want to
be a friend of mine? *

10:39.006 --> 10:41.875
* Did you tattoo a lucky charm

10:41.909 --> 10:46.146
* To keep you out
of harm's way? *

10:46.179 --> 10:49.883
* Warding off all evil signs

10:49.917 --> 10:54.021
* But it never
really kept you safe *

10:54.054 --> 10:57.024
* Now you're too young
for the golden age *

10:57.057 --> 11:01.261
* 'Cause the record bin's
been replaced *

11:01.294 --> 11:05.165
* 27 gone without a trace

11:05.198 --> 11:08.769
* And you walked away
from your drink *

11:08.802 --> 11:12.439
* Amy, don't you go

11:12.472 --> 11:16.343
* I want you around

11:16.376 --> 11:21.014
* Singing, "Whoa-oa-oa,
please don't go" *

11:21.048 --> 11:24.451
* Do you want to be
a friend of mine? *

11:24.484 --> 11:28.355
* Do you want to
be a friend of... *

11:28.388 --> 11:33.226
* Amy, please don't go

11:36.263 --> 11:42.235
* Amy, please don't go

11:44.271 --> 11:46.306
* Is your heart
singing out of tune? *

11:46.339 --> 11:50.944
* Are your eyes
just singing the blues? *

11:50.978 --> 11:54.748
* Dirty records
from another time *

11:54.782 --> 11:59.219
* Some bloodstains
on your shoes *

11:59.252 --> 12:02.289
* May I have this last dance?

12:02.322 --> 12:07.160
* By chance if we should meet

12:07.194 --> 12:10.463
* Can you write me a lullaby

12:10.497 --> 12:14.167
* So we can sing you to sleep?

12:14.201 --> 12:17.470
* Amy, don't you go

12:17.504 --> 12:21.441
* I want you around

12:21.474 --> 12:26.146
* Singing, "Whoa-oa-oa,
please don't go" *

12:26.179 --> 12:29.850
* Do you want to be
a friend of mine? *

12:29.883 --> 12:33.987
* Do you want to
be a friend of mine? *

12:34.021 --> 12:36.824
* Do you want to be
a friend of mine? *

12:36.857 --> 12:38.859
(heavy breathing)

12:48.401 --> 12:49.436
(knock on door)

13:01.381 --> 13:03.116
(knocking)

13:23.170 --> 13:24.471
(people screaming)

13:53.566 --> 13:55.035
(sighs)

14:24.131 --> 14:26.133

14:32.539 --> 14:34.241

14:55.595 --> 14:58.298

15:20.287 --> 15:22.289

15:36.269 --> 15:38.271
(monitor beeping)

16:02.229 --> 16:05.032
*

16:34.527 --> 16:36.596
(elevator chimes)

16:50.543 --> 16:52.545
*

17:15.835 --> 17:18.037
(sniffs)

17:30.150 --> 17:32.119
* Taking a ride

17:32.152 --> 17:35.488
* To my old haunt

17:35.522 --> 17:37.757
* She's in my blood

17:37.790 --> 17:40.793
* I reside in my nightlife

17:40.827 --> 17:44.631
* My favorite color's
candy apple girl *

17:44.664 --> 17:48.401
* And she resides
in my mind *

17:48.435 --> 17:50.570
* And my nightlife

18:11.258 --> 18:15.195
* Well, I am rollin',
strollin' into town *

18:15.228 --> 18:16.463
* Come inside *

18:16.496 --> 18:21.201
* Is it me
or am I going crazy? *

18:21.234 --> 18:22.469
* It's just you *

18:22.502 --> 18:25.372
* This dirty city
is my sugar town *

18:25.405 --> 18:26.373
* Sugar town *

18:26.406 --> 18:28.475
* My little angel of death

18:28.508 --> 18:31.344
* Is my nightlife...
(clattering)

18:47.894 --> 18:49.896
*

19:02.842 --> 19:08.181
* Where in the world's
the forgotten? *

19:09.582 --> 19:14.687
* They're lost inside
your memory *

19:16.989 --> 19:19.359
* You're dragging on

19:19.392 --> 19:23.930
* Your heart's been broken

19:23.963 --> 19:28.601
* 'Cause we all go
down in history *

19:32.305 --> 19:34.241
* Where in the world

19:34.274 --> 19:37.277
* Did the time go?

19:39.312 --> 19:44.317
* It's where your spirit
seems to roam *

19:46.586 --> 19:52.325
* Like losing faith
to our abandon *

19:52.359 --> 19:54.927
* Or an empty hallway

19:54.961 --> 19:58.631
* From a broken home...

20:00.367 --> 20:02.369
(music stops abruptly)

20:09.008 --> 20:11.210
(indistinct chatter,
phones ringing)

20:15.815 --> 20:18.351
(screaming)

20:21.688 --> 20:23.590
(clatter, horns honking)

20:32.665 --> 20:34.667
*

21:02.094 --> 21:03.463
(two gunshots)

21:05.064 --> 21:07.334
(gunshot)

21:26.653 --> 21:28.655
(gunshot, crowd gasping)

21:59.452 --> 22:01.454
(computer beeping)

22:05.558 --> 22:06.726
(beeping)

22:34.421 --> 22:35.455
TAYLOR:
Speak.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.823
Say something. Anything.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.024
I need an explanation.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.158
Tell me how a gun

22:39.191 --> 22:40.893
registered in your name

22:40.927 --> 22:42.094
was used to fire shots

22:42.128 --> 22:44.564
at you this afternoon.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.965
That's not possible.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.000
It happened.

22:49.836 --> 22:50.937
Casings found at the scene

22:50.970 --> 22:53.039
were a match to those

22:53.072 --> 22:54.507
registered in your name,

22:54.541 --> 22:55.908
and to your weapon in CoBIS.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.546
Then my gun was stolen.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.614
And you didn't report it?

23:01.648 --> 23:03.416
I thought I had misplaced it.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.484
What, it wasn't in
your sock drawer,

23:04.517 --> 23:06.686
so you figured it was where?
With your golf clubs?

23:09.055 --> 23:10.490
When did you notice
it was missing?

23:10.523 --> 23:11.524
About six months ago.

23:11.558 --> 23:12.959
Someone broke into my boat.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.828
They stole a few items.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.797
I wasn't even sure
the gun had been there.

23:17.830 --> 23:18.798
Obviously,
it must have been.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.534
At the time, I thought
it was at my beach house.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.202
I looked for it,
and I didn't find it.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.105
That's when you should have
reported it stolen.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.875
I-I just...

23:28.908 --> 23:31.711
The best way to explain it?

23:31.744 --> 23:32.979
Bad timing.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.782
You mean you were
running for the Senate.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.450
That complicates things.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.284
Yes.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.052
However, the priority here,
gentlemen,

23:40.086 --> 23:41.954
is the fact
that a man shot at me.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.456
FLACK:
For you, maybe.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.924
For me, it's the fact
that a little girl

23:44.957 --> 23:46.092
was shot and killed
with your gun.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.627
What?

23:47.660 --> 23:49.662
Guy who took a shot
at you dumped the gun.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.030
Two kids found it.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.832
A little girl was shot.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.867
She died.

23:57.604 --> 23:58.771
I-I'd like to call her family.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.540
FLACK:
Nice. Nice.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.475
Maybe you could take
a couple photos

24:02.509 --> 24:03.610
with her grieving mother.

24:03.643 --> 24:04.844
A nice photo op
for the campaign.

24:04.877 --> 24:05.845
TAYLOR:
Hey, hey, hey.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.880
Take a break.
Come on.

24:10.717 --> 24:12.685
(door shuts)

24:12.719 --> 24:15.087
(sighs)

24:15.121 --> 24:16.489
So now what?

24:17.790 --> 24:21.260
We just need you to answer
one little question.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.130
Who would want you dead,
Mr. Hamilton?

24:24.163 --> 24:25.732
Nobody.

24:28.167 --> 24:31.237
Or any number of people,
I suppose.

24:31.270 --> 24:34.006
My politics are a bit
threatening to some.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.175
And before you decided
to run for office?

24:37.209 --> 24:40.179
I was a successful businessman.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.114
Who pissed a few people off.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.651
Well, let me narrow down
the list for you.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.919
It's someone you invited
onto your boat,

24:46.953 --> 24:48.154
or into your home.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.722
Someone bold enough

24:49.756 --> 24:51.924
to steal your weapon
with the intent to kill.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.230
ROSS:
Blood on the chain-link fence

24:58.264 --> 25:00.667
is a match to the hairs
I found in the baseball cap.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.570
ROSS:
But no match

25:03.603 --> 25:04.904
to anything
in the database.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.706
I also got a partial print

25:06.739 --> 25:08.741
on a bullet from the magazine.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.278
But not enough ridge detail

25:12.311 --> 25:14.013
to even waste our time
with an AFIS search.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.182
Then we got to chase the gun.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.884
Hamilton says it was stolen.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.619
IBIS search came up
with nothing.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.253
It doesn't connect us
with any crimes.

25:21.287 --> 25:23.122
So it looks like what it is.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.257
The guy who stole the gun
shot the gun.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.826
But this is what I don't get:

25:26.859 --> 25:29.228
If he was able to get onto
Hamilton's boat to steal it,

25:29.261 --> 25:31.898
why not just lie in wait
and shoot him there?

25:31.931 --> 25:32.899
Why wait six months?

25:32.932 --> 25:34.200
Nerve.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.935
You've got to talk
yourself into it.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.103
Then there's the planning.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.906
You don't want to mess up.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.173
Or maybe the public event.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.142
The publicity is
something he's after.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.177
Well, he messed up.
He missed.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.648
Well, and then there's
the elephant in the room.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.082
The irony that
a man could be shot

25:50.116 --> 25:51.818
with his own stolen gun.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.152
Yeah.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.187
Well, what if it's
part of a bigger plan?

25:55.221 --> 25:56.789
Hamilton's down
in the polls,

25:56.823 --> 25:59.992
the campaign needs
a little kick...

26:00.026 --> 26:01.160
You know? It just...

26:01.193 --> 26:04.864
Just explain to me why he was
only grazed with the bullet.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.700
HAWKES:
Why?

26:07.734 --> 26:09.836
Because he wasn't the target.

26:09.869 --> 26:12.138
HAWKES:
I took photos and
processed the scene.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.706
And it just didn't
make any sense.

26:13.740 --> 26:17.844
This... is an animated
simulation based on

26:17.877 --> 26:21.213
location of spent casings,
trajectory and bullet recovery,

26:21.247 --> 26:23.650
which helped me calculate
the likely placement

26:23.683 --> 26:24.984
of our shooter in the crowd.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.787
Hamilton entered
from the shooter's left,

26:27.820 --> 26:30.923
moving left to right
towards the podium.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.826
The first shot struck Hamilton
in the right shoulder.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.862
He was slightly grazed.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.163
The next two shots

26:37.196 --> 26:39.198
hit much further
to the left,

26:39.231 --> 26:40.332
damaging the
teleprompter

26:40.366 --> 26:42.001
and the sound speaker.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.103
ROSS:
That's at least two feet
from the first bullet,

26:44.136 --> 26:45.037
and near the ground.

26:45.071 --> 26:48.007
Could somebody have
that bad of a shot?

26:48.040 --> 26:50.142
Fortunately, in this case, yes.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.945
But it doesn't rule out
the possibility

26:52.979 --> 26:54.647
that he was never
aiming for Hamilton.

26:54.681 --> 26:57.249
No, it just introduces
one more problem.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.751
Our shooter might have had

26:58.785 --> 26:59.819
more than one target.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.353
Hamilton, and someone else.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.990
Adam, go over
the news camera footage

27:04.023 --> 27:04.991
and call campaign headquarters.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.125
We need to find out

27:06.158 --> 27:07.794
who was standing
on that stage.
Got it.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.837
(Lindsay sighs)

27:21.908 --> 27:24.143
Hey, Montana.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.411
Hey.

27:25.444 --> 27:28.314
You haven't called me
that in a long time.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.184
How you feeling?

27:32.218 --> 27:34.286
Headache.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.655
You remember anything?

27:38.224 --> 27:40.226
(cheering, applauding)

27:42.795 --> 27:44.063
Lucy.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.098
She's fine.

27:46.132 --> 27:49.702
I dropped her off with
my mother this morning.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.303
Where was she last night?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.239
She was with me, of course.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.341
Yeah, but... when you were here.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.977
Come on, babe, um...

27:58.010 --> 27:59.211
it was hectic here yesterday.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.280
The doctors and
the nurses were in and out.

28:01.313 --> 28:02.949
You were knocked out
the whole time,

28:02.982 --> 28:05.351
so I kissed you good-bye,

28:05.384 --> 28:07.186
and I took Lucy home with me.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.222
No, but later.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.159
You were standing by the window,

28:13.192 --> 28:16.796
holding vigil for
your poor, injured wife.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.164
Who was Lucy with?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.033
I think you might
have been dreaming.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.135
Was I naked
in that, uh, moment?

28:23.169 --> 28:25.738
(laughing):
No.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.041
(sighs)

28:29.075 --> 28:30.977
Did you catch the shooter?

28:31.010 --> 28:33.112
No. All those people...

28:33.145 --> 28:34.747
and not one positive I.D.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.248
What do you mean?

28:36.282 --> 28:37.416
No one saw this guy's face.

28:38.450 --> 28:39.752
I did.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.988
Hmm?

28:42.021 --> 28:43.756
I looked right into his eyes.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.491
He looked right into mine.

28:45.524 --> 28:48.727
This guy knows
that you saw his face.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.832
What time did you say
I was here last night?

28:56.969 --> 28:58.070
Yeah.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.239
That's definitely
what he looks like.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.474
Just got off the phone
with the night shift.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.276
They said there was
a man in here last night

29:04.310 --> 29:05.411
after visiting hours,

29:05.444 --> 29:07.980
and they gave me
a basic description.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.016
Six, one;
brown hair above the ears;

29:10.049 --> 29:11.984
short on the neck;
square jaw.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.219
Couldn't give me eye color

29:13.252 --> 29:14.887
or complexion;
it was too dark.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.123
DANVILLE:
Let's whip out another
one without the hat,

29:17.156 --> 29:17.990
and get these out ASAP.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.158
We're looking into
hospital surveillance.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.260
DANNY:
You know what, look into
the hospital security.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.395
How the hell did
this guy get up here?

29:23.429 --> 29:24.396
Yeah, I know.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.564
We got unis outside right now.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.532
We'll have them at your place,

29:26.565 --> 29:29.168
and your mother's.
Is that really necessary?

29:29.201 --> 29:31.437
DANVILLE:
There was a reason
he was here, Linds.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.572
You saw him, and he knows it.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.008
(sighs)

29:40.046 --> 29:41.914
Do that again, Danny.
What?

29:41.948 --> 29:44.216
Fog the window.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.517
Move your coffee cup across it.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.324
Wow.

29:52.358 --> 29:55.227
We might have a possible print
on the glass here.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.596
Are we seeing letters here?

29:57.629 --> 29:59.932
Does that say "RR"?

29:59.966 --> 30:02.468
DANVILLE:
I think so.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.170
Looks like an...

30:04.203 --> 30:06.205
an "M..."

30:07.173 --> 30:09.308
DANVILLE:
"R-R..."

30:09.341 --> 30:11.911
"Y."

30:11.944 --> 30:13.946
What do you got there, Don?

30:15.247 --> 30:17.583
Well, buying a vowel,
it looks to me

30:17.616 --> 30:19.185
like "I'm sorry."

30:28.460 --> 30:30.096
DANNY:
I'll bet you he's sorry.

30:30.129 --> 30:32.331
He left a print.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.106
The partial I lifted

30:40.139 --> 30:41.874
got us a match to Evan Wescott.

30:41.908 --> 30:43.042
All right?
Unfortunately for him,

30:43.075 --> 30:45.111
all public school
teachers are printed.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.246
So Flack's got units
heading to his house,

30:47.279 --> 30:50.082
to the school, tracking all
his credit card activity.

30:50.116 --> 30:51.317
Got his name and face

30:51.350 --> 30:53.652
to all transportation
headed out of the city.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.354
So far,
he's made no moves.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.588
Any connection
to Grant Hamilton?

30:56.622 --> 30:57.957
Not directly.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.625
Wescott never made
a contribution,

30:59.658 --> 31:01.460
never made a complaint.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.628
Hamilton, on the other hand,

31:02.661 --> 31:04.296
is a big supporter
of public schools--

31:04.330 --> 31:05.998
more specifically,
public school teachers.

31:06.032 --> 31:07.266
So I'm not seeing motive.

31:07.299 --> 31:08.434
DANVILLE:
Okay.

31:08.467 --> 31:09.668
I appreciate it.

31:09.701 --> 31:10.903
Thank you.

31:10.937 --> 31:11.938
All right.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.674
Beverly McCord.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.276
Public school supervisor.

31:17.309 --> 31:18.677
Check this out.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.913
(beeping)

31:22.181 --> 31:24.416
HAWKES:
She's one of Hamilton's VIPs.

31:24.450 --> 31:25.684
Standing just to
Hamilton's right.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.020
Which would be to
the shooter's left.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.221
TAYLOR:
So, if she was Wescott's target,

31:29.255 --> 31:32.224
that explains the misdirection
of the two additional shots.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.960
DANNY:
Right, okay, okay,
but why her?

31:33.993 --> 31:35.094
What's Wescott's beef?

31:35.127 --> 31:36.095
DANVILLE:
Three years ago,

31:36.128 --> 31:38.430
when she was
principal of PS 423,

31:38.464 --> 31:40.166
she had the school board
investigate

31:40.199 --> 31:41.633
one of her elementary
school teachers.

31:41.667 --> 31:44.070
That would be our shooter,
Evan Wescott.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.605
Don't know the details,
but do know that he was

31:46.638 --> 31:48.174
definitely laid off
from his job.

31:48.207 --> 31:49.541
Well, it had to be something big

31:49.575 --> 31:51.543
to make such a public
attempt at revenge.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.980
I get the feeling,
if we find her, we'll find him.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.948
DANNY:
What makes you think he's
gonna go after her again?

31:55.982 --> 31:57.183
Well, for 24 hours,

31:57.216 --> 31:58.650
no one knew his name,
where he lived

31:58.684 --> 32:00.286
or what he looked like,

32:00.319 --> 32:02.054
so he had plenty of time
to get out of town.

32:02.088 --> 32:03.322
But he didn't.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.291
Means he's got
unfinished business.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.728
*

32:09.761 --> 32:11.630
* Ooh...

32:16.168 --> 32:19.671
* Walking after dark

32:19.705 --> 32:22.441
* In the New York City park...

32:22.474 --> 32:23.442
Evan!

32:23.475 --> 32:25.377
Shut up and walk.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.279
(siren whoops)

32:27.313 --> 32:29.715
* ...in the holiest of holes

32:29.748 --> 32:31.550
* Onward,
Christian soldiers... *

32:31.583 --> 32:33.219
Don't even think
about screaming.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.488
* The blood left
on the dance floor *

32:36.522 --> 32:38.590
* Running, running red
Walk.

32:38.624 --> 32:39.591
Just go.
No!

32:39.625 --> 32:41.060
You don't want to do this.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.562
* ...is killing you to death
unless you... *

32:43.595 --> 32:45.464
Flack, Beverly McCord's
not at home or her office,

32:45.497 --> 32:46.698
and she's not
answering her cell,

32:46.732 --> 32:48.467
but it's live
and we're tracking it now.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.102
Hold on.
Three seconds.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.203
Two seconds.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.739
Ooh! 1726 West 48th.
1726 West 48th.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.707
Stop. Evan...

32:55.741 --> 32:58.610
Please. Please!

32:58.644 --> 32:59.611
Move!
(grunts)

32:59.645 --> 33:01.347
We can talk about this.
Shut up!

33:01.380 --> 33:03.182
Just shut up.
I tried talking to you,

33:03.215 --> 33:06.385
but frankly, you have
a hard time understanding me.
Please!

33:06.418 --> 33:08.254
I'm sorry.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.356
Please, think about
your future!

33:10.389 --> 33:12.358
Future?
What future, huh?

33:12.391 --> 33:14.793
My future?
The one that you ruined?!

33:14.826 --> 33:16.495
Yeah-yeah!

33:16.528 --> 33:17.529
High five.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.631
High five!
Yeah! High five.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.267
Whoa. Slow down, guy.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.001
Are you okay?
Here, hop up.

33:24.570 --> 33:27.139
Hop up! Let me take
a look at that.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.208
That hurt?
Yeah.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.410
You're gonna be okay.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.379
Hurt?
Yeah.

33:35.281 --> 33:36.415
(chuckles)

33:36.448 --> 33:38.517
You have a good day,
all right?

33:38.550 --> 33:40.052
Bye.

33:41.553 --> 33:44.523
(mouthing)

33:46.858 --> 33:49.395
(gate rattles)

33:49.428 --> 33:50.429
(gasping)

33:50.462 --> 33:52.398
(hushed):
Shut up!

33:52.431 --> 33:54.566
Come on.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.836
* Someone kill the DJ,
shoot the ... DJ*

33:57.869 --> 34:03.342
* Someone kill the DJ,
shoot the ... DJ*

34:03.375 --> 34:07.413
* Someone kill the DJ,
shoot the ... DJ*

34:07.446 --> 34:11.850
* Someone kill the DJ,
shoot the ... DJ*

34:11.882 --> 34:14.485
* Someone kill the DJ...

34:14.520 --> 34:16.322
Drop the knife, Wescott.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.724
* Someone kill the DJ,
shoot the ... DJ*

34:18.757 --> 34:20.859
Do it!

34:20.891 --> 34:23.762
* Someone kill the DJ,
shoot the ... DJ*

34:23.795 --> 34:26.331
Hey, hold it right there!

34:26.364 --> 34:28.667
(grunting)

34:28.699 --> 34:30.636
Don't move!

34:30.668 --> 34:35.873
* Voices in my head are saying,
"Shoot that ... down." *

34:35.907 --> 34:38.110
This is the last time
you're making me run.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.585
Thank you.

34:47.619 --> 34:48.820
MAN:
Mac?

34:48.853 --> 34:50.556
Kevin.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.291
Here, I bought
you a coffee.

34:52.324 --> 34:55.261
Oh, thank you.

34:55.293 --> 34:56.428
Look, thanks for
meeting me.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.230
I know you have
a busy practice.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.432
It's no problem.
It's great to see you.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.800
It's been a while.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.503
I do have to say
I'm a little concerned, though.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.639
You sounded,
um, not yourself.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.708
I'm having a bit
of a tough time.

35:09.741 --> 35:13.445
Aftermath of the
shooting, the surgery.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.746
That's common.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.282
It's only been
eight months.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.184
What is it, pain?

35:18.217 --> 35:19.651
Aphasia.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.420
I can't remember the
simplest things.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.790
It can come and go,
but my guess is

35:24.823 --> 35:25.657
it's getting worse.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.793
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have called me.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.595
No. I don't know.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.897
They... gave me

35:31.930 --> 35:36.535
those coloring book
pictures and name games.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.470
They gave me a bunch
of exercises

35:38.504 --> 35:40.406
that don't seem
to be working.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.209
I just... I just
want to fix this.

35:43.242 --> 35:46.245
Mac, it doesn't work that way.

35:46.278 --> 35:50.216
You're past the window
of "temporary aphasia."

35:50.249 --> 35:52.518
So you're going to have
to retrain your brain.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.220
It's like learning
everything all over again.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.422
It takes time.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.689
I can't name
simple words.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.691
Simple objects I've known
my whole life.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.693
Look, I... I'm in charge
of people, Kevin.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.429
I've got a very demanding job.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.797
I should be able
to name the color red.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.466
I can understand
your frustration, but...

36:07.499 --> 36:08.700
No, don't do that!

36:08.734 --> 36:11.403
I don't want your
understanding.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.974
I... I'm sorry, Kevin.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.244
I-I just want this to go away.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.712
There's got to be something
medically that we can do.

36:20.746 --> 36:24.950
No. And out of respect, I'm not
gonna sugarcoat this for you.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.652
There is no quick fix,

36:26.685 --> 36:28.554
no pill, no surgery.

36:28.587 --> 36:31.457
There's just word games
and exercises.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.927
You know, your greatest gift
is Christine.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.798
I haven't told her yet.

36:39.831 --> 36:42.334
Have you told anyone?

36:42.368 --> 36:44.536
This is my problem.

36:44.570 --> 36:49.841
I just want a schedule
and a plan that I can stick to.

36:49.875 --> 36:54.313
And I'll... I'll get better,
and it will all go away.

36:54.346 --> 36:56.448
I can appreciate your optimism,

36:56.482 --> 36:59.885
but, you know,
you cannot do this alone.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.256
Look, I... I got to go.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.891
Thanks.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.459
I'll call you later.

37:07.493 --> 37:08.827
Thank you.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.675
OFFICER:
Shoulder to shoulder.
Heads up.

37:23.709 --> 37:24.910
Look forward.

37:28.980 --> 37:32.784
That's him,
number four.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.387
That's the shooter.
All right.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.455
Let's bring Lonnie in.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.028
You can go in now.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.540
Hey, Lonnie. I want you
to stand up here

37:54.573 --> 37:57.476
and tell me if you see
the face of the man

37:57.509 --> 37:59.811
who threw the gun
in the Dumpster, okay?

37:59.845 --> 38:02.681
Just take your time.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.486
He can't see you.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.396
Say the number.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.398
Four.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.367
You're sure?

38:30.008 --> 38:32.744
Yeah, that's him.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.984
Okay.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.752
I didn't mean to hurt Aimee.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.088
I know that.

38:43.121 --> 38:45.023
We were just playing around,
you know?

38:46.392 --> 38:49.761
She was my best friend.

38:49.795 --> 38:51.730
Thanks for trying to save her.

38:51.763 --> 38:54.065
Yeah, you're welcome, Lonnie.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.504
Am I going to jail
for what I did?

38:58.537 --> 39:02.340
No. We're all gonna make sure
that doesn't happen.

39:14.653 --> 39:18.056
Where'd you get the gun, Evan?

39:18.089 --> 39:21.126
I stole it.

39:21.159 --> 39:22.861
There was a party

39:22.894 --> 39:25.864
at Grant Hamilton's
beach house, a...

39:25.897 --> 39:29.000
It was a fund-raiser
for schools.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.803
Several teachers were invited,
and I was one of them.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.641
Had a little bit to drink,

39:35.674 --> 39:37.743
and I started snooping
through drawers.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.178
There it was.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.614
It was the answer to my problem.

39:42.648 --> 39:44.182
You've been planning this
for some time.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.452
Beverly McCord decided

39:46.485 --> 39:48.053
that I was doing something
to kids.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.522
Something that I wasn't.

39:50.556 --> 39:53.058
It was a hug. She was crying.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.025
It was inappropriate.

39:54.059 --> 39:57.529
The placement of your hands
was inappropriate.

39:57.563 --> 40:00.532
Did Audrey came to you?
I mean, did her parents call?

40:00.566 --> 40:02.100
No. I witnessed it.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.803
Evan, you tend to show...

40:04.836 --> 40:07.539
a certain degree
of uninhibited affection,

40:07.573 --> 40:08.974
and it's got to stop.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.943
It making me and others
uncomfortable.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.545
Others.
You're having conversations

40:13.579 --> 40:15.681
about my behavior with others?

40:15.714 --> 40:17.816
Touching the children
in any way is dangerous.

40:17.849 --> 40:19.918
Affection is dangerous?

40:19.951 --> 40:22.454
Frankly, I don't understand
why you don't get this.

40:22.488 --> 40:23.522
Oh, I get it.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.857
I get that this is your problem,
Beverly, not mine.

40:25.891 --> 40:27.659
Your sick imagination
took an action

40:27.693 --> 40:29.828
that was so innocent,
and you made it perverted.

40:29.861 --> 40:33.465
And you know what? That...
that makes me uncomfortable.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.234
I was laid off for six months

40:36.267 --> 40:38.570
without pay and denied benefits.

40:38.604 --> 40:42.774
Two months later, they...
I was cleared of any suspicion,

40:42.808 --> 40:47.045
and it took another year
to get back into the school.

40:47.078 --> 40:48.847
But that didn't matter.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.584
I couldn't shake the skepticism,
and I... I still can't.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.853
There was never
any proof.

40:54.886 --> 40:57.723
Just her accusations.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.258
I wanted to stop it.
I had to stop it.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.594
The rally just seemed
like the perfect time.

41:02.628 --> 41:03.695
Lot of people.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.230
I could get lost
in the crowd.

41:05.263 --> 41:07.933
And the fact that it
was Grant Hamilton's gun

41:07.966 --> 41:10.969
and his event
is just an ironic fluke.

41:12.638 --> 41:15.974
I would never do anything
to hurt a child.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.009
(clapping)

41:18.043 --> 41:21.046
Yeah, I suppose I deserve that.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.948
You could have made
a different choice, Evan.

41:22.981 --> 41:26.852
But instead, you brought a gun
to a public place

41:26.885 --> 41:28.820
with the intention
of murdering someone.

41:28.854 --> 41:32.290
And when you fired
that weapon,

41:32.323 --> 41:36.127
you changed the lives
of every person there.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.697
You violated their sense
of security,

41:38.730 --> 41:41.132
but worse than that...

41:41.166 --> 41:44.202
you hurt a child,
and you don't even know it.

41:48.574 --> 41:49.975
What are you talking about?

41:50.008 --> 41:54.746
You dropped that gun
in that Dumpster,

41:54.780 --> 41:57.783
and it was found...

41:57.816 --> 42:00.752
and it was fired.

42:03.589 --> 42:05.657
And this little girl was killed.

42:09.227 --> 42:11.597
Her name was Aimee DeSilva.

42:18.303 --> 42:20.271
(door opens, closes)

42:46.331 --> 42:48.333
(giggling)

42:52.804 --> 42:54.973
* Well, don't look away

42:55.006 --> 42:59.845
* From the arms of a bad dream

42:59.878 --> 43:02.280
* Don't look away

43:02.313 --> 43:08.219
* Sometimes you're better lost
than to be seen *

43:11.056 --> 43:13.324
* Don't look away

43:13.358 --> 43:17.896
* From the arms of a moment

43:17.929 --> 43:20.331
* Well, don't look away

43:20.365 --> 43:25.671
* From the arms of tomorrow

43:25.704 --> 43:27.906
* Don't look away

43:27.939 --> 43:31.276
* From the arms of a moment

43:31.309 --> 43:33.278
* Don't look away

43:33.311 --> 43:35.881
* From the arms of love.
