<i>...share of transports in gross domestic

will surely affect the level of our...</i>

00:44.713 --> 00:46.547
Close the windows, close the windows!

01:08.672 --> 01:10.630
- Oh, hello...
- No. Ma, Ma, Ma! Ma.

01:10.713 --> 01:12.588
- What?
- They are seriously fighting outside.

01:15.463 --> 01:17.505
Should we throw him on the ground?

01:18.130 --> 01:19.130
Stop this!

01:21.088 --> 01:22.005
Stop it!

01:22.088 --> 01:24.463
Who's in charge here?
Stop it!

01:25.797 --> 01:26.922
Hey, quiet.

01:27.005 --> 01:28.005
Put him down.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.463
Igwe, put the fool down.

01:31.922 --> 01:32.755
Go inside.

01:32.838 --> 01:36.130
Since morning, we've been
bringing passengers to this park.

01:36.713 --> 01:38.630
Please give us our money so we can leave!

01:38.713 --> 01:41.338
Or else no bus will leave this park.

01:45.755 --> 01:47.338
You children of the rich...

01:48.005 --> 01:49.672
coming back from America.

01:50.672 --> 01:52.005
Please let me ask you...

01:53.130 --> 01:54.838
is this how your conduct your business?

02:01.005 --> 02:04.005
When you come to Nigeria,
you act like a Nigerian.

02:04.088 --> 02:05.880
Correct!

02:05.963 --> 02:07.047
Or else...

02:08.338 --> 02:11.172
This behavior of yours,
who does it benefit?

02:12.213 --> 02:13.213
Who?

02:14.047 --> 02:15.880
Look at all the faces

02:16.338 --> 02:17.838
of everybody's life

02:17.922 --> 02:19.713
you are stopping right now.

02:21.005 --> 02:22.005
For what?

02:22.047 --> 02:23.463
What is our business?

02:23.797 --> 02:27.172
Taking people from one destination
to the other.

02:28.005 --> 02:29.838
Contributing to society.

02:30.713 --> 02:31.713
So...

02:33.130 --> 02:35.838
you say you're a Nigerian? Hm?

02:36.630 --> 02:38.630
Yeah, we're Nigerian.

02:39.630 --> 02:41.172
Act like a Nigerian,

02:41.672 --> 02:44.255
and come back and we'll talk
like civilized human beings.

02:45.588 --> 02:47.338
Go. We'll give you your money

02:47.547 --> 02:49.297
but please go home,

02:50.047 --> 02:52.005
and let's get on with our lives.

02:54.255 --> 02:55.297
Good speech, Ma.

02:55.380 --> 02:57.088
Did you hear her?

02:57.255 --> 02:59.672
In due time
we'll see what happens.

03:00.505 --> 03:01.713
My brothers, let's go.

03:01.797 --> 03:04.380
You've not been generous to us.

03:04.463 --> 03:06.505
We'll be back.

03:07.713 --> 03:10.672
Are you no longer "The Obiagus"?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.005
Let's go,.

04:36.630 --> 04:37.838
Good morning, sir.

04:37.922 --> 04:39.922
Hello. You're welcome.

04:47.297 --> 04:49.005
I think we should start now.

04:49.588 --> 04:53.880
I know just as much as Adaeze
regarding this presentation.

04:54.047 --> 04:55.630
She can join us later on.

05:02.797 --> 05:06.130
Good morning, gentlemen. Chief.
You're welcome.

05:06.213 --> 05:07.755
- How are you?
- Welcome.

05:12.005 --> 05:13.505
We have to start.

05:16.755 --> 05:20.422
- Alright, alright. Okay. We can start.
- Okay.

05:20.505 --> 05:22.630
Right, so regarding the pr...

05:22.713 --> 05:24.547
- Sorry.
- There she is.

05:25.047 --> 05:27.963
Apologies for the lateness, gentlemen.
Sorry.

05:30.172 --> 05:31.172
Okay.

05:31.922 --> 05:32.963
Sorry, dad.

05:38.297 --> 05:39.672
Okay.
Shall we?

05:42.838 --> 05:45.005
<i>Lionheart's transport.</i>

05:45.088 --> 05:48.172
<i>Your number one transport service
in Nigeria.</i>

05:48.797 --> 05:53.713
<i>With over 200 buses and 50,000 passengers
catered to weekly,</i>

05:53.797 --> 05:57.088
<i>we've built a strong reputation
for safety and comfort.</i>

05:57.672 --> 06:00.880
<i>From Enugu to any of the 36 states
in Nigeria,</i>

06:00.963 --> 06:04.463
<i>we are more than prepared to grow
with the coast city.</i>

06:05.047 --> 06:09.755
<i>This is where we are best suited
for the proposed Bus Rabbit Transit,</i>

06:09.838 --> 06:13.422
<i>BRT system, being developed
for Enugu State.</i>

06:13.838 --> 06:18.380
<i>Our fleet is extensive,
and our personnel experienced.</i>

06:18.547 --> 06:22.088
<i>Lionheart Transport,
the right way to travel.</i>

06:25.255 --> 06:26.505
That was...

06:26.755 --> 06:28.380
really impressive.

06:28.463 --> 06:30.672
I must say, the best we have seen so far.

06:31.963 --> 06:35.505
We'll set up a meeting with the minister
for the final phase.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.588
I think we have something on our hands.

06:38.672 --> 06:41.713
Chief, you must be a proud father.

06:42.963 --> 06:45.213
Of course, I'm immensely proud
of my daughter.

06:45.297 --> 06:47.463
She's her father's daughter.

06:47.547 --> 06:48.880
Congratulations.

06:49.463 --> 06:50.463
The most beautiful.

06:52.963 --> 06:54.922
Alright, we'll both be going. Yeah.

06:55.130 --> 06:57.088
- I'm cool.
- Hey.

06:58.005 --> 07:00.005
- Chief.
- Daddy, Daddy?

07:00.088 --> 07:01.963
Daddy? Daddy, what's wrong?

07:02.047 --> 07:03.172
- Chief.
- What's wrong?

07:03.255 --> 07:04.630
- Get someone.
- Wait.

07:04.713 --> 07:06.505
- Daddy?
- Chief, sir.

07:06.588 --> 07:09.028
- Daddy, wh...
- Call his doctor. Call his...

07:10.755 --> 07:12.672
Your company, IG Motors,

07:12.755 --> 07:15.130
and Lionheart are both the front runners

07:15.213 --> 07:18.547
for the recently announced
Enugu State BRT contract.

07:18.797 --> 07:20.422
Sir, but in recent light

07:20.505 --> 07:23.547
of the unfortunate incident
with Mr. Obiagu,

07:23.672 --> 07:26.297
do you think this puts your company
at an advantage?

07:26.380 --> 07:28.338
Oh, stop that young man.

07:29.130 --> 07:31.005
<i>This is not the place or time.</i>

07:32.630 --> 07:35.505
<i>However, let me make this point.</i>

07:36.047 --> 07:40.213
Our transport division is one of the most
successful in the entire state.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.422
For your information,

07:44.880 --> 07:46.338
IG Motors

07:46.630 --> 07:49.380
has the capacity to take on new contracts

07:49.922 --> 07:51.880
or new companies as the case may be,

07:51.963 --> 07:53.463
<i>for the benefit of the people.</i>

07:53.630 --> 07:56.630
<i>By companies,
are you referring to Lionheart company?</i>

07:59.047 --> 08:00.088
Young woman.

08:01.172 --> 08:03.963
This is not the time, or the place.

08:04.338 --> 08:07.838
However, my deepest condolences...

08:07.922 --> 08:10.088
Sorry, my best wishes to him...

08:10.172 --> 08:12.380
Can you imagine
what this fool is saying?

08:12.463 --> 08:16.297
I've told you so many times
to take it easy.

08:16.380 --> 08:18.713
He sends his condolences.

08:19.338 --> 08:22.838
Take it easy.

08:22.922 --> 08:26.672
I've begged you multiple times.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.380
He obviously paid these journalists.

08:30.255 --> 08:32.547
He wants to buy my company
while I'm still alive.

08:33.005 --> 08:34.380
That'll be over my dead body.

08:34.462 --> 08:36.130
What do you mean by "Over my dead body"?

08:36.337 --> 08:37.712
Company this, company that.

08:37.837 --> 08:40.337
Let them take your company
if that will keep you alive.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.587
That's enough.

08:43.672 --> 08:47.672
Ada, wait, I'm telling you,
this is next level shit...

08:47.880 --> 08:50.130
Once I shoot this video,
everything will change.

08:50.338 --> 08:52.463
I'll be successful, I'm telling you.

08:52.922 --> 08:54.713
Just help me out, talk to daddy.

08:54.797 --> 08:57.047
You said this, these last two videos.

08:57.630 --> 09:00.088
We gave you four million,
and that went nowhere.

09:00.255 --> 09:01.963
How is this different?

09:02.088 --> 09:05.005
[in HausaAre you really saying this?
Is this how you're seeing it?

09:05.088 --> 09:08.922
Don't see things this way, trust me.
Just help me talk to him.

09:09.005 --> 09:11.422
[in English I'll talk to daddy,
but no promises.

09:11.588 --> 09:13.797
I suggest you talk to mummy,
to talk to him too.

09:14.005 --> 09:16.797
No, but you know he only listens to you.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.297
Not true, he listens to mummy too.

09:20.713 --> 09:22.963
Talk to your dad. Talk to him!

09:24.130 --> 09:25.588
Daddy, what have you done?

09:26.338 --> 09:28.213
Tell him to get some rest.

09:29.505 --> 09:31.297
Oh, daddy, you need to rest.

09:31.380 --> 09:34.797
I will not rest until I've dealt
with Igwe Pascal.

09:35.588 --> 09:36.797
Then I will rest.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.172
What has he done this time?

09:39.130 --> 09:40.963
Nothing about work here. No.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.380
Mummy.

09:43.172 --> 09:45.005
Mummy, let's have a chat.

09:55.630 --> 09:57.588
Tell me, what about Igwe Pascal?

09:58.130 --> 10:00.297
He's gunning for the contract, isn't he?

10:01.755 --> 10:02.755
I thought so.

10:03.547 --> 10:05.380
Come, come, come...

10:05.463 --> 10:07.213
- No, I'm not doing anything.
- Yeah,

10:07.297 --> 10:10.005
- I promise you. Daddy wh...
- My friend, come.

10:10.172 --> 10:11.630
Okay, dad, bye bye.

11:00.213 --> 11:02.588
- <i>Good morning, GM.
- Good morning, madam.</i>

11:02.672 --> 11:03.672
Thank you.

11:03.922 --> 11:06.880
- Is LH33 running now?
- Since yesterday, madam.

11:06.963 --> 11:08.213
- Okay, good.
- But...

11:08.297 --> 11:11.797
Enugu-Sagamu route is running low
on passengers.

11:11.963 --> 11:12.797
Why?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.963
I don't know. It has been happening
for some time.

11:16.422 --> 11:18.088
Okay, how about Enugu-Auchi?

11:18.172 --> 11:19.172
It's booming.

11:19.838 --> 11:21.797
- Port Harcourt?
- It's okay.

11:22.755 --> 11:25.380
Alright, well, re-route
some of their buses to those areas

11:25.463 --> 11:26.963
and I'll see what's going on.

11:27.047 --> 11:29.963
- Alright, madam.
- Meanwhile, please, service LH45.

11:30.047 --> 11:32.547
- I don't like the way it's sounding.
- That we'll do, madam.

11:32.630 --> 11:33.880
Okay. Thank you.

11:35.672 --> 11:37.588
Good morning.

11:37.672 --> 11:39.380
- Good morning, Ma'am.
- Morning.

11:39.880 --> 11:40.880
- Thank you.
- Yes, Ma.

11:40.963 --> 11:42.443
The conference call is in 15 minutes.

11:42.505 --> 11:44.981
The board members are already gathering
in the conference room.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.005
- Okay.
- Yes, madam.

11:46.047 --> 11:48.588
And your meeting with the external
auditors is at one o'clock.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.380
I think you're going to be
a very good MD, Ma.

11:57.505 --> 11:59.588
I mean there's no Lionheart without you.

11:59.672 --> 12:01.672
No disrespect to the Chairman.

12:02.047 --> 12:04.213
My father is still very much alive,
Onyinye.

12:04.630 --> 12:05.672
But thank you.

12:11.005 --> 12:12.005
Anything else?

12:12.380 --> 12:15.380
No, no, Ma... Fifteen minutes.

12:17.922 --> 12:21.422
<i>As you all know,
right now I'm not...</i>

12:21.505 --> 12:25.422
<i>in the best of health to carry out
my responsibilities.</i>

12:25.505 --> 12:30.547
<i>But Lionheart will have to soldier on,
until I get back on my feet.</i>

12:30.630 --> 12:33.297
<i>You will need new leadership,</i>

12:33.380 --> 12:37.838
<i>so that Lionheart doesn't fall behind</i>

12:37.963 --> 12:42.130
<i>on the perfect service we provide
to our customers.</i>

12:42.338 --> 12:45.297
Chief, if I may interrupt here.

12:46.463 --> 12:51.672
I believe I speak for the rest
of the members of the board when I say

12:51.755 --> 12:55.588
that we really respect your judgment.

12:57.338 --> 13:00.463
We all have contributed to the success
of this company,

13:00.547 --> 13:02.505
even though some more than others.

13:02.963 --> 13:04.588
But, but you, you are right.

13:04.922 --> 13:10.047
This company needs someone
with the right kind of vision and drive

13:10.130 --> 13:12.380
to take the wheel of this company.

13:12.588 --> 13:17.547
<i>You've always been very articulate Samuel,
we are all a family.</i>

13:17.713 --> 13:23.338
<i>And family is the ideal
on which I started this company.</i>

13:24.713 --> 13:28.672
<i>In that spirit, I now name my replacement.</i>

13:31.505 --> 13:35.047
<i>Chief Godswill Obiagu,
my younger brother.</i>

13:37.130 --> 13:40.463
<i>For those of you who don't know,</i>

13:41.047 --> 13:44.880
<i>Godswill is the MD of our Owerri
headquarters.</i>

13:45.338 --> 13:49.213
<i>Effectively immediately, he will oversee
the day-to-day running</i>

13:49.297 --> 13:50.963
<i>of the various departments,</i>

13:51.047 --> 13:58.047
<i>while my daughter, Adaeze, will remain
as Director of Logistics and Operations.</i>

13:59.713 --> 14:03.255
<i>Goodbye, everyone, and good luck.</i>

14:03.505 --> 14:04.797
Hello, everyone.

14:10.755 --> 14:12.630
Wish you the very best.

14:12.755 --> 14:13.755
You're welcome.

14:22.338 --> 14:23.422
Sorry, Chief.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.922
My name is Samuel Akah,

14:26.005 --> 14:28.838
the director of Engineering Services.

14:30.172 --> 14:33.838
Please permit me to congratulate you
on your appointment.

14:34.172 --> 14:38.213
If there's anything you need,
just remember me as your Man Friday, sir.

14:38.547 --> 14:39.755
I'm impressed.

14:41.755 --> 14:42.755
Yes, sir.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.422
Well, once again, welcome, sir.

14:48.380 --> 14:49.380
Uncle.

14:54.130 --> 14:57.130
Adaeze!

14:57.672 --> 14:59.047
You're looking good.

14:59.213 --> 15:01.463
- I haven't seen you for some time.
- Yes.

15:01.547 --> 15:04.505
You know you could go for a beauty
contest now and win.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.922
Thank you, uncle, but I have

15:07.005 --> 15:09.755
- my hands full with... the company.
- Yes I can see that.

15:09.963 --> 15:11.672
- Looking good.
- How's aunty and the kids?

15:11.922 --> 15:13.255
Well, they are doing great.

15:14.838 --> 15:16.297
- They're fine.
- Okay. Welcome.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.255
- Yeah.
- Congratulations, and...

15:18.463 --> 15:20.088
I have to go and...

15:21.047 --> 15:22.838
I have some catching up to do.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.380
No, no, no, feel free.
Do whatever you want to do.

15:25.505 --> 15:28.713
I'm just going to go round the company
to see things for myself.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.380
Okay. See you.

16:07.547 --> 16:09.380
I'm so sorry, Ma.

16:10.130 --> 16:13.255
I really thought your father was going
to make <i>you </i> the next MD.

16:15.880 --> 16:16.880
So did I.

16:19.755 --> 16:20.755
So did I.

16:23.630 --> 16:26.547
Ma, should I reschedule your... meeting?

16:49.838 --> 16:51.463
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

16:54.922 --> 16:55.922
Ada.

16:56.338 --> 16:57.338
You are not at work?

16:57.380 --> 16:58.922
Good morning, mummy.
I'm going to work.

16:59.005 --> 17:00.547
I just need to see daddy briefly.

17:02.088 --> 17:03.838
Your daddy's resting.

17:03.963 --> 17:05.713
I know, mummy, but it's urgent.

17:05.797 --> 17:07.255
I know, I know...

17:08.047 --> 17:09.755
But if it concerns work,

17:10.463 --> 17:12.422
please speak to your uncle first.

17:12.505 --> 17:14.422
It, it's about uncle and... Wait.

17:14.755 --> 17:16.505
You knew Uncle Godswill was coming?

17:17.422 --> 17:20.297
Well, your daddy and I discussed it.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.505
I don't understand. What is he doing here?

17:22.588 --> 17:23.838
Don't slouch!

17:25.547 --> 17:28.172
Come on. Let's go talk.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.172
- I, I don't get it.
- Let's go talk.

17:31.963 --> 17:32.797
Sit.

17:32.880 --> 17:33.880
Ada.

17:38.047 --> 17:39.088
Ada...

17:40.463 --> 17:43.422
Your uncle is just here to supervise.

17:43.797 --> 17:45.755
Who is he supervising, mummy?

17:46.380 --> 17:49.547
If he is doing all the supervision,
then of what use am I?

17:51.130 --> 17:52.130
My daughter,

17:52.838 --> 17:55.588
a second hand always helps.

17:56.297 --> 17:59.380
Your father started this company
with your uncle, you know.

17:59.463 --> 18:02.588
Yes, but I've been working side by side
with daddy for over seven years.

18:02.755 --> 18:04.588
<i>I</i> should be acting MD.

18:05.963 --> 18:09.630
I'm sure he has his reasons,
and you're just gonna have to trust him.

18:11.547 --> 18:14.463
I bet those reasons would not exist
if Obiora were in my shoes.

18:17.713 --> 18:18.713
Sit up.

18:19.463 --> 18:20.797
And then shut up.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.630
Think before you speak.

18:24.713 --> 18:25.713
Think.

18:27.297 --> 18:30.838
Your father loves and appreciates you,
and you know it.

18:31.630 --> 18:34.463
His reasons have nothing to do
with you being a woman.

18:37.463 --> 18:39.005
Just doesn't seem fair.

18:39.463 --> 18:41.380
I work really, really hard.

18:43.213 --> 18:44.213
It's okay.

18:44.505 --> 18:46.088
It's okay.

18:46.172 --> 18:49.088
Your uncle is just here to support you.

18:49.172 --> 18:50.630
And support I shall.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.963
- Goddy.
- Abigail.

18:54.172 --> 18:57.338
So you are visiting
because you heard Ernest is ill?

18:57.422 --> 19:00.297
Is this how you welcome me?

19:00.380 --> 19:04.088
If you wanted to see me,
you would have come to Owerri.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.755
Okay, you win.

19:06.838 --> 19:08.598
But remember you won't be
so lucky next time.

19:08.630 --> 19:10.755
- Till then.
- But it's good to see you.

19:10.838 --> 19:12.838
Look at you. Handsome.

19:14.797 --> 19:17.437
Ada-nna, you didn't tell me
you were leaving the office.

19:17.463 --> 19:19.963
You know we both can't be out
at the same time.

19:21.297 --> 19:22.838
You see?

19:22.922 --> 19:24.005
I'm leaving.

19:24.838 --> 19:27.172
Oh, now you're leaving?

19:27.255 --> 19:28.755
Is it because I reminded you?

19:29.088 --> 19:30.088
Wait.

19:30.422 --> 19:32.797
We'll leave together.

19:32.880 --> 19:37.463
Listen, there's food.
Bitterleaf soup and pounded yam.

19:37.588 --> 19:39.588
I can't eat right now.

19:39.672 --> 19:44.088
Let me see Chief first
then we can talk about food later.

19:44.172 --> 19:45.172
Okay.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.047
What about Obiora?

19:48.130 --> 19:51.588
Obiora sleeps in the studio.
That's where he lives.

19:51.672 --> 19:53.922
It's all part of the hussle.

19:54.213 --> 19:56.172
Uncle, daddy's resting.

19:57.588 --> 19:59.172
Let me go and rest with him.

20:02.213 --> 20:03.713
But you said he was resting.

20:04.047 --> 20:06.422
Don't ever come between two brothers.

20:07.713 --> 20:08.713
Wh...?

20:15.422 --> 20:17.213
Chief, are you there?

20:29.630 --> 20:30.755
I have come!

20:30.880 --> 20:33.422
- Welcome. How is your family?
- They are all fine.

20:34.172 --> 20:35.213
Good morning, daddy.

20:35.297 --> 20:38.255
- Adaeze my daughter, how are you?
- I'm fine.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.047
How are you?

20:40.672 --> 20:44.838
Well, I think I am doing well
by the grace of God,

20:45.047 --> 20:48.213
and the inspiration
I get from my brother sitting here.

20:50.047 --> 20:51.172
It's a better day.

20:52.713 --> 20:55.547
Do you have anything to tell me?
Want to tell me something?

20:56.547 --> 20:58.755
No, I just came to check up on you.

20:59.005 --> 21:00.797
That's very thoughtful of you.

21:01.047 --> 21:02.755
Thanks, honey, and God bless you.

21:02.838 --> 21:05.438
- I'll head back to the office now.
- That's my daughter.

21:05.463 --> 21:06.713
Uncle, see you.

21:08.922 --> 21:13.797
Odogwu... I don't... I think something
is disturbing... she's not happy.

21:15.755 --> 21:17.797
I know that she's not happy.

21:19.255 --> 21:21.380
And I can understand why.

21:23.630 --> 21:29.422
Adaeze needs to understand
that life doesn't always go as planned.

21:31.213 --> 21:35.463
I brought you over so that you can be
of assistance to Adaeze.

21:35.588 --> 21:37.505
To come and be of assistance to her.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.672
It's a good decision.

21:39.755 --> 21:43.588
When it comes to family,
we are all on the same journey.

21:43.672 --> 21:44.672
True.

22:22.088 --> 22:23.130
Where's everybody?

22:24.463 --> 22:26.838
<i>♪ In the morning ♪</i>

22:27.005 --> 22:29.380
<i>♪ Early in the morning ♪</i>

22:29.672 --> 22:31.588

22:31.672 --> 22:34.255

22:34.338 --> 22:35.172

22:35.255 --> 22:37.380

22:37.505 --> 22:39.922

22:42.088 --> 22:44.672

22:47.755 --> 22:50.297

22:52.380 --> 22:55.047

22:55.130 --> 23:00.130
You see, I am going to change
a lot of things in this establishment.

23:00.963 --> 23:05.047
Prayers will have to be one of them.
Okay.

23:05.380 --> 23:07.505
Now that you have been invigorated,

23:07.588 --> 23:09.505
you have now been showered,

23:09.838 --> 23:12.922
some blessings from God
and that will make you agile.

23:13.005 --> 23:15.047
I want you to go back to your posts now

23:15.130 --> 23:17.463
as people who have received blessing.
Amen!

23:17.547 --> 23:18.380
Amen.

23:18.463 --> 23:19.463
Back, back, back...

23:19.505 --> 23:20.838
Praise the lord.

23:22.088 --> 23:23.088
Ada-nna.

23:25.338 --> 23:26.338
Ada-nna.

23:28.005 --> 23:29.047
Morning.

23:30.005 --> 23:32.963
You know I wonder why
and I was, I was...

23:33.047 --> 23:36.088
trying to admonish them to be doing this.

23:36.172 --> 23:39.547
It's not all about money.
God is the provider of money.

23:39.630 --> 23:41.230
Do you know what I'm saying?

23:41.880 --> 23:43.630
No, I can see that.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.547
Made lots of improvement.

23:45.755 --> 23:47.088
Just to warm the place up.

23:47.172 --> 23:50.380
So, what's on your schedule, like, today?

23:50.463 --> 23:52.297
What is the order of business for today?

23:52.630 --> 23:55.713
Well, first things first,
we have to get you settled in.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.255
I haven't forgot I'm supposed
to have an office.

23:58.338 --> 24:01.838
You know, naturally you will be in daddy's
office which is right there.

24:01.963 --> 24:03.963
Odogwu's office, don't go there.

24:04.130 --> 24:06.380
Ogodwu is the oracle of this company,

24:06.505 --> 24:09.255
I am not qualified to take his seat, no.

24:09.588 --> 24:11.838
Look, I don't need anything elaborate.

24:11.922 --> 24:14.338
This place is, this is perfect for me now.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.588
This is good, yes it is.

24:21.297 --> 24:22.297
This is good.

24:26.297 --> 24:27.672
Uncle, are you sure?

24:28.380 --> 24:31.588
Look, Ada-nna, if you want
to spray insecticides

24:31.672 --> 24:34.547
on cockroaches, snakes and scorpions,

24:34.630 --> 24:37.172
you take yourself, get yourself
a vantage position.

24:37.422 --> 24:41.963
Here is a vantage position,
so I can have my lens all over them.

24:43.172 --> 24:44.172
Don't worry.

24:48.130 --> 24:49.963
Okay. If you insist.

24:50.047 --> 24:51.047
I insist, my dear.

24:52.047 --> 24:54.088
No problems. I'll work here.

24:54.213 --> 24:55.213
Ma?

24:55.755 --> 24:59.463
The external auditors
are coming upstairs now. Right now.

25:00.630 --> 25:02.297
Okay. I will be in my office.

25:07.963 --> 25:11.380
Uncle, I have a meeting
with the external auditors.

25:11.463 --> 25:13.297
I don't know if you would like to join me.

25:13.630 --> 25:18.047
- Is it necessary? Well, if it is...
- Yes, so please. Please.

25:18.130 --> 25:19.130
Alright.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.422
Chameleon. Very good.

25:38.047 --> 25:39.422
Thank you for coming.

25:39.630 --> 25:41.922
So, given our current situation

25:42.005 --> 25:44.088
can you tell us how bad the numbers are?

25:44.172 --> 25:45.172
Bad.

25:45.672 --> 25:47.297
Try abysmal, madam.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.063
But I could have told you that yesterday

25:50.088 --> 25:52.630
if you hadn't cancelled our appointment
scheduled at...

25:52.713 --> 25:54.255
12:00 p.m., West African time.

25:56.963 --> 25:58.005
I apologize.

25:58.547 --> 26:00.422
I had an emergency so I had to...

26:00.505 --> 26:03.963
We all have emergencies, Miss Obiagu.

26:04.422 --> 26:08.047
For instance, I had an emergency
appointment with a doctor today at...

26:08.130 --> 26:10.088
9:00 a.m., West African time.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.755
Again, I apologize.

26:14.838 --> 26:16.255
Now if we can get back to...

26:16.338 --> 26:17.713
No, no. Wait.

26:17.797 --> 26:21.047
You said you had an emergency
with the doctor.

26:21.130 --> 26:24.047
Could you tell us what the emergency was?

26:24.172 --> 26:25.672
Teeth whitening.

26:27.630 --> 26:28.713
With what paint?

26:28.922 --> 26:31.088
This thing I'm seeing, it can't be whiter.

26:32.422 --> 26:33.838
Throwing away your money.

26:34.922 --> 26:36.755
Back to the numbers.

26:37.255 --> 26:38.255
Yes.

26:38.463 --> 26:40.088
Lionheart is in severe debt.

26:40.172 --> 26:41.005
Debt?

26:41.088 --> 26:42.838
You people are owing.

26:43.713 --> 26:46.463
Nine hundred and fifteen million Naira.

26:46.547 --> 26:47.547
What?

26:48.463 --> 26:50.005
That's almost one billion!

26:50.172 --> 26:53.297
- No.
- Nine hundred and fifteen million Naira.

26:53.422 --> 26:57.130
Your father took a loan
from various banks last year.

26:57.713 --> 26:59.047
What was the loan for?

26:59.130 --> 27:00.463
Against our advice.

27:00.547 --> 27:03.588
Chairman took a loan to acquire...

27:03.713 --> 27:06.005
One hundred luxurious buses.

27:06.088 --> 27:09.422
For the BRT contract
and now it's time to pay up.

27:10.297 --> 27:11.297
Okay.

27:12.338 --> 27:15.338
Okay. Let's not panic. So what do we do?

27:15.463 --> 27:16.797
Pay up your debt.

27:16.880 --> 27:17.922
In 30 days.

27:18.005 --> 27:20.172
Or, risk losing everything.

27:21.755 --> 27:22.755
Good day.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.880
Now, wait, auditor. Auditor.

27:25.505 --> 27:26.505
Auditor.

27:26.630 --> 27:28.838
No, wait, I have something to chip in.

27:31.505 --> 27:32.505
One billion!

27:32.797 --> 27:35.047
Why would Ernest go to borrow
one billion? What for?

27:35.130 --> 27:36.338
And without telling me.

27:36.755 --> 27:37.922
In this recession.

27:38.630 --> 27:41.255
Are you sure these people
are telling the truth?

27:42.047 --> 27:43.797
Well we have to find out. I...

27:44.005 --> 27:46.130
No, it's time to... Let's reach Odogwu.

27:48.255 --> 27:52.005
So, daddy, the external auditors
showed up today,

27:52.505 --> 27:54.963
talking about a loan
that you took last year.

27:57.630 --> 28:00.172
Nine hundred and fifty million Naira,
daddy.

28:00.255 --> 28:01.505
Yes, Odogwu.

28:02.422 --> 28:08.338
I don't know how you took
such an amount without telling anybody.

28:08.422 --> 28:09.422
My God.

28:12.880 --> 28:17.963
"A man's response to an urgent matter

28:18.922 --> 28:21.172
determines his character."

28:21.463 --> 28:22.963
Do you understand what I mean?

28:23.047 --> 28:26.088
We needed buses
to improve our fleet.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.047
Agreed.

28:27.130 --> 28:28.547
That meant money.

28:28.755 --> 28:32.672
I had no choice but to go to the bank
and collect some money.

28:32.755 --> 28:33.880
- But, daddy...
- You know.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.880
I think you took a huge gamble.

28:35.963 --> 28:38.547
It's not like we've been guaranteed
the BRT contract.

28:38.630 --> 28:41.755
That's another thing.
You see, what's so important to me

28:41.838 --> 28:45.213
is the loan, and how the bank
is going to recover...

28:45.297 --> 28:47.897
Their approach is different
when recovering their loan.

28:47.922 --> 28:50.047
They will go for your blood
when they come back.

28:50.588 --> 28:53.713
There should have been alternatives.

28:53.797 --> 28:57.338
I agree with what you've said.

28:58.630 --> 29:00.838
I got into this business,

29:01.880 --> 29:07.088
principally to take people
to various destinations in comfort...

29:08.047 --> 29:09.047
in style.

29:10.630 --> 29:13.047
It has become a legacy with our company.

29:13.172 --> 29:16.963
If we lose that legacy,
we have lost everything.

29:17.047 --> 29:20.880
Daddy, but right now it seems like
we have risked everything.

29:21.588 --> 29:22.963
You've put us...

29:23.338 --> 29:26.130
We've been put in such a vulnerable
position right now, daddy,

29:26.213 --> 29:28.172
and we don't have
that much time on our side.

29:28.547 --> 29:29.713
Because of that,

29:29.797 --> 29:33.255
I've decided to invite your Uncle Godswill

29:33.505 --> 29:35.755
to be a part of this establishment,

29:35.838 --> 29:40.005
because I believe that two heads
are better than one.

29:42.588 --> 29:44.713
Let's see what comes out of the fridge,
uh?

30:09.505 --> 30:10.755
- Morning.
- Good morning, Ma.

30:11.172 --> 30:12.172
Morning.

30:21.672 --> 30:22.838
Good morning, uncle.

30:22.963 --> 30:24.630
You missed the morning devotion.

30:25.588 --> 30:28.880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I was working all night.

30:29.255 --> 30:31.547
I came up with a plan, uncle.

30:32.338 --> 30:35.380
It's something I call
my three-point agenda.

30:37.255 --> 30:39.463
Okay. This is good.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.088
- Honestly, I must confess.
- Yeah, thank you.

30:42.172 --> 30:43.547
And, here...

30:44.297 --> 30:45.297
take a look.

30:46.963 --> 30:49.338
I've been doing some research myself.

30:50.130 --> 30:52.713
A transport company in Kano

30:52.797 --> 30:58.047
needs a merger with another company
from Southeast,

30:58.130 --> 31:01.380
and we must not miss this.

31:02.297 --> 31:05.588
I don't think a merger is what we need
right now, uncle.

31:05.672 --> 31:06.672
Really?

31:07.297 --> 31:08.297
So what do we need?

31:09.547 --> 31:10.547
Trust me.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.880
This is a plan that has been
tried and tested.

31:14.005 --> 31:15.047
It works.

31:15.380 --> 31:19.380
So the first thing we need to do,
is get an extension on the 30-day loan.

31:19.588 --> 31:21.630
I mean, technically 29 now,

31:22.172 --> 31:25.630
and I've asked the accountant to set up
meetings with all the banks that we owe.

31:26.172 --> 31:28.713
And I have one for today which is at...

31:29.713 --> 31:31.838
now, so I have to go.

31:32.380 --> 31:33.588
<i>We </i> have to go.

31:35.213 --> 31:37.213
No, no, uncle, it's okay, I've got this.

31:37.338 --> 31:41.255
And, besides, <i>you </i> said one of us needs
to stay here so...

31:41.338 --> 31:43.255
It doesn't apply here. Listen.

31:43.797 --> 31:47.588
if we have to fight this war, Ada-nna,
we have to fight it together,

31:47.672 --> 31:48.963
unless we want to lose.

31:49.047 --> 31:51.630
So... I'm at your service nationwide.

31:52.922 --> 31:53.922
Let's go.

31:55.588 --> 31:56.588
Okay.

32:10.088 --> 32:12.838
I'm afraid I can't give you an extension.

32:16.213 --> 32:19.255
I can assure you we have a
solid chance at the deal,

32:19.338 --> 32:20.713
we just need more time.

32:20.922 --> 32:24.172
I'm just asking for you to be patient
with us.

32:24.755 --> 32:25.880
We're definitely going...

32:26.672 --> 32:27.672
Keep talking.

32:27.755 --> 32:29.672
Go ahead and talk.

32:37.838 --> 32:39.422
I am so sorry.

32:39.672 --> 32:41.588
It wasn't approved.

32:52.422 --> 32:54.130
<i>Use that against them.</i>

32:54.213 --> 32:55.088
Okay, sir.

32:55.172 --> 32:57.297
<i>But don't rush. Take your time.</i>

32:57.380 --> 32:58.755
Yeah. Okay, sir.

32:58.838 --> 33:01.713
<i>- The minute they get there.</i>
- Yeah, I think they're here already.

33:01.797 --> 33:03.880
<i>Good. Waste their precious time.</i>

33:03.963 --> 33:04.838
I'll handle it.

33:04.922 --> 33:07.422
<i>- I do not want to be disturbed.</i>
- I'll take care of it, sir.

33:09.463 --> 33:12.380
So, how can I help you,
Mr. and Mrs. Obiagu?

33:13.047 --> 33:15.755
No, no. He's my uncle.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.172
Yes, she's my niece.

33:18.255 --> 33:19.547
Okay, I see.

33:19.630 --> 33:22.713
Anyway, we would like to apply for a loan.

33:23.547 --> 33:25.005
We have the track record.

33:25.547 --> 33:26.713
We have collateral.

33:26.963 --> 33:30.505
But most importantly,
we have an impeccable reputation.

33:31.297 --> 33:32.547
Lionheart.

33:38.755 --> 33:40.588
Impeccable reputation indeed.

33:41.547 --> 33:43.147
I'm sorry, what's that supposed to mean?

33:43.172 --> 33:48.130
Of course, everyone knows that Lionheart
is presently facing bankruptcy.

33:48.672 --> 33:51.088
Plus your father,
he's owing so many banks.

33:51.338 --> 33:53.422
So how come you're asking for a new loan?

33:53.505 --> 33:54.630
Well...

33:54.713 --> 33:56.963
We are not facing bankruptcy.

33:57.047 --> 33:59.922
It's just... it's just the times
that we're in.

34:00.005 --> 34:02.838
It's a minor setback, we'll pull through.

34:02.922 --> 34:04.838
It's okay, I expect you to say that.

34:05.088 --> 34:06.963
Listen, as the manager,

34:07.422 --> 34:10.505
we know the process of obtaining loans.

34:10.588 --> 34:11.922
We're not kids.

34:12.505 --> 34:16.297
Just tell us what it will take
for us to get this loan. Finished. Simple.

34:16.422 --> 34:19.380
Well, I really don't understand.

34:19.672 --> 34:22.047
What don't you understand,
for Kingdom's sake?

34:23.547 --> 34:25.213
Look, I give you, you give me.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.047
It's give and take.
Everything has a price.

34:27.130 --> 34:29.505
Even life has a price.
Tell us what it will take.

34:30.005 --> 34:31.965
- Uncle, what are you doing?
- I'm doing business.

34:32.255 --> 34:36.672
It's okay, sir, but I hope
you are not trying to bribe me.

34:36.755 --> 34:38.547
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no, no... He's not...

34:38.630 --> 34:40.213
Look, what do you mean by bribe?

34:40.297 --> 34:42.088
Tell us what you're waiting for,

34:42.172 --> 34:45.338
I will give it to you.
I've told you name any price.

34:45.422 --> 34:47.963
It's okay, it's okay. Calm down. You mean?

34:48.130 --> 34:49.713
- Name anything.
- My price?

34:49.797 --> 34:50.963
Yes, your price.

34:59.755 --> 35:00.755
Well...

35:02.338 --> 35:04.547
your niece here is not looking bad at all.

35:05.338 --> 35:06.338
Excuse me?

35:07.422 --> 35:08.838
I mean, she's good.

35:10.047 --> 35:11.047
My price.

35:26.547 --> 35:29.088
Uncle, you shouldn't have.

35:31.797 --> 35:35.213
Abomination.

35:42.172 --> 35:43.172
Yes.

35:45.422 --> 35:46.422
Yes.

35:50.047 --> 35:51.088
Yes.

35:52.047 --> 35:53.380
He punched you?

35:54.047 --> 35:55.672
What a savage.

35:58.630 --> 35:59.630
I see.

36:02.338 --> 36:03.672
Which police station?

36:04.213 --> 36:05.213
Hey!

36:06.213 --> 36:07.672
Excuse me.

36:08.088 --> 36:11.338
Do you know the people
that you are toying with? Do you?

36:11.422 --> 36:12.547
You're finished.

36:12.630 --> 36:15.130
Uncle, please,
let's not make things any worse.

36:15.463 --> 36:18.172
- They are right, we are wrong.
- Says who?

36:18.255 --> 36:21.088
You can't go about bribing
and punching people.

36:21.713 --> 36:24.797
Did I punch him? Was a very sluggish jab.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.231
If I had punched him,
he would have been in hospital by now.

36:27.255 --> 36:28.422
He doesn't mean it.

36:28.630 --> 36:32.588
At times a jab, one good punch will make
a man come back to his senses.

36:32.672 --> 36:33.672
Sarge.

36:38.547 --> 36:41.338
Ada. Relax. I know what I'm doing.

36:41.422 --> 36:43.922
Don't keep blaming me in their presence.

36:44.463 --> 36:47.343
Your father knows what I can do
and that was why he brought me into this.

36:47.422 --> 36:49.422
Relax. If I blow hot, you blow cold.

36:49.547 --> 36:51.047
So, no one has come for them.

36:51.172 --> 36:52.380
Nobody. Nobody.

36:55.963 --> 36:58.130
- Okay, I'm going for a brief meeting.
- Okay, sir.

36:58.213 --> 36:59.630
- I'll be back.
- Yes, sir.

37:30.922 --> 37:32.505
Onyinye! Thank God you're here.

37:32.588 --> 37:35.463
I can't believe they would actually
lock you up in here, like...

37:35.547 --> 37:37.387
Do you know who she be?
Do you have any idea...

37:37.463 --> 37:39.213
It's, okay, Onyinye, it's fine. I'm okay.

37:39.297 --> 37:42.130
- Just pay the bail money and let's go.
- We have a slight problem, Ma.

37:42.255 --> 37:45.172
There's an emergency board meeting
going on right now at the office.

37:45.713 --> 37:47.588
- Why? What for?
- I don't know.

37:47.672 --> 37:48.922
Approved by who?

37:49.338 --> 37:51.672
Samuel.
And Igwe Pascal is in the building.

37:52.713 --> 37:54.838
Snakes! Scorpions!

37:54.922 --> 37:57.547
Hurry. Pay the money
and let's get out of here.

37:58.505 --> 37:59.505
Samuel.

38:01.297 --> 38:05.255
Ada-nna, who's this Igwe Pascal,
and what does he want?

38:05.463 --> 38:08.297
Uncle, I don't know, but whatever it is,
I'm sure it's not good.

38:08.463 --> 38:10.063
Madam, he's not letting me pay the bail.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.088
- Why?
- I don't know.

38:12.172 --> 38:13.172
What's the problem?

38:13.588 --> 38:15.422
Madam,
my superior is not around.

38:15.505 --> 38:18.172
And I can't grant bail
if he's not around to sign.

38:18.255 --> 38:20.422
So, if your boss
suddenly dies,

38:20.505 --> 38:22.255
we will die here
because he's not around.

38:22.338 --> 38:24.630
Well, that's ridiculous.
We're ready to go.

38:24.713 --> 38:28.797
Madam, please be patient.
He'll be back soon.

38:28.880 --> 38:31.755
Come on, release us! Are you crazy?

38:31.838 --> 38:34.606
- Release my madam, Officer.
- We're ready to pay for bail.

38:34.630 --> 38:38.047
Okay, listen, this is an emergency.
We need to leave this place so...

38:38.213 --> 38:39.893
Look, whatever it takes, what do you want?

38:39.922 --> 38:42.322
Just name your price, but we need
to get out of here, please.

38:42.463 --> 38:45.547
Ada-nna, is that your voice? You...

38:46.172 --> 38:47.172
bribe?

38:48.963 --> 38:51.880
Uncle, this is different.
Okay, talk to me.

38:52.338 --> 38:54.463
Madam, I understand.

38:54.922 --> 38:56.130
But the problem is...

38:56.213 --> 38:59.253
If my superior comes in
and he doesn't see a man and a woman here,

38:59.297 --> 39:02.255
- he will dismiss me.
- So your arrest is based on arithmetic.

39:02.588 --> 39:04.088
One man, one woman.

39:04.422 --> 39:06.047
Is that what you're telling me?

39:07.255 --> 39:10.297
Don't worry. A man and a woman right?
He will meet a man and a woman.

39:10.380 --> 39:11.713
Just open the gate.

39:23.547 --> 39:24.755
My name is...

39:25.672 --> 39:28.463
Igwe Pascal.

39:34.963 --> 39:37.088
It is no more a secret,

39:38.213 --> 39:41.463
that I have an interest in Lionheart.

39:47.505 --> 39:48.963
Unfortunately...

39:50.630 --> 39:51.630
this company...

39:52.922 --> 39:54.213
has lost its vision

39:55.338 --> 39:56.588
and purpose.

39:57.172 --> 40:01.547
Its <i>modus operandi</i> is out of the '40s.

40:02.255 --> 40:03.880
Gentlemen and ladies,

40:04.463 --> 40:07.672
I am here to bring the change.

40:09.505 --> 40:10.505
Sarge.

40:11.005 --> 40:12.005
Salute!

40:32.172 --> 40:33.963
What is he doing here?

40:34.755 --> 40:36.922
And in my father's chair.

40:37.338 --> 40:38.713
Calm down, calm down.

40:39.797 --> 40:44.630
Mr. Igwe Pascal is here
because I invited him to come here.

40:45.130 --> 40:46.880
And also because he...

40:47.005 --> 40:49.505
has something very important
to share with the board.

40:49.588 --> 40:51.505
Shut that pipe you call mouth!

40:51.588 --> 40:54.731
These no other person that will betray
the company except an albino rat like you.

40:54.755 --> 40:57.547
The board knows
about the default on the loan.

40:58.005 --> 41:02.088
How could you keep this from them?
How could you be so irresponsible?

41:02.172 --> 41:04.547
I... can explain.

41:04.630 --> 41:08.005
It's just a minor setback
which we have under control.

41:08.088 --> 41:09.588
Unfortunately,

41:09.922 --> 41:13.963
Daniel has come to judgment
in the person of Mr. Pascal Igwe.

41:14.422 --> 41:17.963
Now Mr. Pascal Igwe has drawn out
a very generous proposal,

41:18.838 --> 41:22.630
to buy out Lionheart
and incorporate it into IG Motors.

41:23.047 --> 41:26.380
A three billion Naira buy-out.

41:28.505 --> 41:31.755
I, for one would take
this course of action

41:32.130 --> 41:35.297
very, very quickly given the limited time
we have left.

41:35.380 --> 41:38.463
And, let's not forget the recent failures
of the Obiagus.

41:38.547 --> 41:40.505
- I beg your pardon!
- But!

41:40.755 --> 41:42.838
I cannot honestly say that I can...

41:42.922 --> 41:45.505
trust the Obiagus' ability to...

41:46.380 --> 41:49.380
provide the kind of leadership
this company needs.

41:49.463 --> 41:53.338
I was calling you a scorpion,
you're worse than a scorpion.

41:54.005 --> 41:55.005
You're a snake.

41:55.588 --> 41:56.505
You're a vampire.

41:56.588 --> 41:59.922
Gentlemen, there is no need
for name-calling.

42:01.338 --> 42:04.297
I am a busy businessman.

42:04.963 --> 42:06.630
I haven't got time for this.

42:08.130 --> 42:11.005
The bank has given you two weeks.

42:11.755 --> 42:16.213
I give you ten days to make up your mind.

42:16.588 --> 42:17.588
Good day, gentlemen.

42:17.672 --> 42:20.297
I'll see you off as well.

42:21.130 --> 42:23.630
No, leave him. That's how traitors do.

42:25.297 --> 42:26.963
Sir, Madam.

42:27.547 --> 42:29.338
Please do not listen to this man.

42:29.880 --> 42:34.130
Look, my father built this company
on the core values of courage and trust,

42:34.213 --> 42:36.922
and I implore you right now to trust me.

42:37.047 --> 42:39.005
My uncle and I have this under control.

42:39.088 --> 42:40.713
You ask us to trust you.

42:41.463 --> 42:46.047
Your family has been less than forthcoming

42:46.130 --> 42:48.005
- with the board.
- Exactly.

42:48.088 --> 42:52.838
Look, finding out about a loan
from an outsider is not encouraging.

42:53.630 --> 42:54.630
It's not.

42:55.338 --> 42:57.297
- We respect your father.
- That's right.

42:57.380 --> 43:00.297
But... for the sake of the future
of this company,

43:01.463 --> 43:05.130
We have no choice but to consider
Mr. Pascal's offer.

43:05.213 --> 43:06.880
Who said you don't have a choice?

43:06.963 --> 43:10.505
We have a choice. Look...
And we have just one choice,

43:11.172 --> 43:13.172
- reject his proposal.
- No.

43:13.255 --> 43:14.797
- Refuse his offer.
- No!

43:14.922 --> 43:19.213
Please, look, if this company falls
into the hands of Igwe Pascal,

43:19.755 --> 43:23.713
I can assure you it will be
a shadow of itself.

43:23.922 --> 43:27.047
Lionheart will not be the company
as you know it today.

43:27.130 --> 43:28.130
Yes.

43:28.755 --> 43:32.422
So, please give us a chance to make
things right, please.

43:32.547 --> 43:33.547
Please.

43:37.088 --> 43:40.672
Igwe gave you ten days,
Igwe Pascal.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.630
- Take ten days.
- Yes.

43:43.713 --> 43:46.213
- Ten days is okay.
- That's okay.

43:46.297 --> 43:49.255
- No, Chief, even ten days will...
- We'll take it.

43:49.755 --> 43:52.088
- Ten days?
- I think is rather impromptu...

43:52.213 --> 43:56.338
And, sorry, but in the foreseeable
future, gentlemen...

44:11.005 --> 44:12.005
So...

44:13.047 --> 44:15.672
You don't have to be moody at all.
You have...

44:16.172 --> 44:19.838
You have done the best any woman,
any man can do.

44:20.297 --> 44:22.630
In fact, what you need now is rest.

44:22.797 --> 44:25.297
Rest? Uncle, this is not the time to rest.

44:25.380 --> 44:28.213
- Why?
- Igwe Pascal is a ruthless business man.

44:28.797 --> 44:31.463
He doesn't care about Lionheart,
or its people, just its assets.

44:32.255 --> 44:34.255
If that man becomes the owner
of this company,

44:34.338 --> 44:36.922
many people will lose their jobs,
I can assure you.

44:37.088 --> 44:38.005
God Forbid!

44:38.088 --> 44:40.088
He cannot be.
That's number one.

44:40.963 --> 44:43.963
- What would the families begin to do?
- Exactly.

44:45.463 --> 44:50.213
You know you were telling
me about your plans.

44:50.463 --> 44:52.213
I want to know all your plans, now.

44:52.380 --> 44:54.130
I assume that this one is plan one.

44:55.130 --> 44:58.963
Well, I was hoping that the BRT contract
would go through.

44:59.047 --> 45:00.338
Actually I'm very positive it...

45:00.422 --> 45:04.463
Ada-nna, the BRT is like a
a corporate job. It can't be relied on.

45:04.547 --> 45:06.380
It can go away at any time.

45:06.463 --> 45:11.172
Just like marriages of the past...

45:11.255 --> 45:15.588
where the woman is idle and eats up
the wealth of the man.

45:15.672 --> 45:16.872
Unlike what is obtainable now.

45:16.922 --> 45:19.362
Anyway,
you might not understand what I'm saying.

45:19.422 --> 45:21.422
No, I understand fully, uncle.

45:21.505 --> 45:24.439
That's why I work hard for my money.
I'm not here to depend on any man to...

45:24.463 --> 45:26.213
Don't get angry,
I didn't mean it that way.

45:26.297 --> 45:28.630
I'm not getting angry
but I've dated men that...

45:29.255 --> 45:30.547
You've dated men that did what?

45:30.630 --> 45:31.856
Did anyone hurt you?

45:31.880 --> 45:33.480
Talk to me, I'm your uncle.

45:33.505 --> 45:35.425
- You have dated men that...
- No, thanks, uncle.

45:35.838 --> 45:36.838
But…

45:37.547 --> 45:39.463
I think I know a man we can rely on.

45:40.338 --> 45:41.338
Are you sure?

45:41.463 --> 45:42.463
Arinze!

45:42.963 --> 45:44.130
Who is Arinze?

45:55.880 --> 45:56.922
Excuse me.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.880
Excuse me. Sorry, where's Arinze?

46:00.338 --> 46:01.338
Thank you.

46:01.880 --> 46:02.880
Uncle?

46:03.130 --> 46:05.922
You know what, you can just wait here.
I'll be back.

46:06.005 --> 46:07.645
- No, let me go with you.
- No, it's fine.

46:07.713 --> 46:09.731
- He's alright. It will only take a minute.
- Really?

46:09.755 --> 46:12.297
- Yes.
- Okay. Are you sure you'll be safe?

46:16.088 --> 46:17.172
Hello, how are you?

46:17.338 --> 46:18.338
I'm alright.

47:10.547 --> 47:12.130
- Hey!
- Hey.

47:12.213 --> 47:14.380
What a pleasant surprise.

47:14.505 --> 47:16.005
- Hi.
- Look at you.

47:19.088 --> 47:23.755
I and my partner, we can supply you
with all the vehicles you need.

47:25.005 --> 47:27.380
This is our inventory.
You can go through it.

47:27.463 --> 47:29.255
All the model numbers are there.

47:29.422 --> 47:31.047
We can supply to you

47:31.755 --> 47:35.255
only if you can pay that 30% deposit.

47:35.338 --> 47:36.213
Okay.

47:36.297 --> 47:38.505
- Well, how is your dad?
- Yeah...

47:38.588 --> 47:41.338
- Hope he's recovering?
- Oh, he's much better. Thank you.

47:41.422 --> 47:42.255
Thank God.

47:42.338 --> 47:46.588
Okay, I won't, uh, take much of your time
so you can get back to your stuff.

47:49.005 --> 47:50.380
Lionheart is in trouble.

47:51.297 --> 47:52.297
Yeah.

47:52.963 --> 47:54.630
And I need a loan.

47:55.338 --> 47:57.547
Please can you tell him to hurry up.

47:57.630 --> 47:59.797
I want to buy myself a new car.

48:01.505 --> 48:04.338
He should pay up fast.

48:04.505 --> 48:08.588
I'm not playing here.
I'm a hustler.

48:09.588 --> 48:10.963
What did he say?

48:11.047 --> 48:13.005
Oh, he was saying that...

48:13.088 --> 48:17.338
you have a sense of business,
he likes your personality.

48:17.547 --> 48:20.963
- Ah, thank you, sir.
- That you have an eye for good business.

48:21.047 --> 48:22.505
Thank you. I appreciate it.

48:23.422 --> 48:26.505
We are in debt of 950 million.

48:27.463 --> 48:30.713
Yeah. I'm hoping to raise
at least a third of it,

48:30.838 --> 48:34.088
and if I'm able to get that, then...

48:34.172 --> 48:35.630
I will give you 500.

48:36.547 --> 48:37.547
What?

48:37.963 --> 48:39.047
You heard me right.

48:39.963 --> 48:42.338
I will give you 500.

48:44.463 --> 48:47.588
You have 500 million
just lying about Arinze, really?

48:47.672 --> 48:50.672
Not really, but I can always
work things out.

48:50.755 --> 48:51.880
Are you serious?

48:52.338 --> 48:53.755
Of course, I'm very serious.

48:55.672 --> 48:58.713
30% is a little over 100 million.

48:59.047 --> 49:02.047
Sounds too good to be true. I don't know.

49:02.505 --> 49:05.172
It's not like that, I'm just doing
just a giveaway,

49:05.255 --> 49:07.505
because this is my first business
with you.

49:07.797 --> 49:11.422
You need to be mindful
of the money so we know our share.

49:11.505 --> 49:13.838
Remember Arinze has a cut.

49:14.005 --> 49:19.255
I'm aware. If I had known,
I would have added more money.

49:19.338 --> 49:22.380
Because he's a nice man.
That's why I'm giving it to him.

49:22.463 --> 49:24.505
That's giving a good price.
You understand?

49:24.588 --> 49:25.838
Once he pays...

49:25.922 --> 49:26.922
Hey!

49:27.630 --> 49:30.547
Arinze! My God. Thank you!

49:31.338 --> 49:35.630
Thank you. I promise you
I will pay back every penny.

49:35.963 --> 49:38.172
- There is this contract that we're...
- Ada.

49:38.255 --> 49:42.922
Ada, be cool.
Enough of all this business talk.

49:44.005 --> 49:46.380
What would you like to drink?

49:46.463 --> 49:50.463
No, I have to go back
to the office, I'm on duty so...

49:50.547 --> 49:53.547
Like, seriously, you go to work like this.

49:53.630 --> 49:56.422
This is, this is a long story.
Don't even ask.

49:57.130 --> 49:58.672
Now you look so tense.

49:58.922 --> 50:00.422
Arinze I'm not, I'm not tense. I'm...

50:00.922 --> 50:02.297
You are tense.

50:02.922 --> 50:03.922
I'm not tense.

50:04.255 --> 50:05.255
You're not?

50:05.755 --> 50:10.255
I don't know you,
but if you like your life, you leave now.

50:10.338 --> 50:12.064
I don't... What are you talking about?

50:12.088 --> 50:15.047
These people are not what you think
they are.

50:15.130 --> 50:17.330
They are swind...
What do you call "shit" at your place?

50:18.088 --> 50:19.088
<i>Kashi.</i>

50:19.130 --> 50:21.422
These are two pieces of <i>kashi.</i>
Very bad ones.

50:21.672 --> 50:25.255
The are swindlers. They are here to...
I was here, listening to them in Igbo.

50:25.338 --> 50:28.005
You don't understand Igbo.
So they are playing you in Igbo.

50:28.088 --> 50:29.797
- You know what?
- Hm?

50:30.838 --> 50:34.213
I think I have something
to get you more relaxed.

50:34.922 --> 50:36.005
Like, like what?

50:37.172 --> 50:38.547
Wait. I'm coming.

50:38.797 --> 50:39.797
Arinze?

50:44.088 --> 50:45.672
- Don't listen to this man.
- Sorry.

50:45.755 --> 50:47.630
- You can see this man is drunk.
- No, no.

50:47.713 --> 50:49.356
- Let's do... We can do this business.
- No.

50:49.380 --> 50:51.380
Save your life. Save your money.

50:51.463 --> 50:53.047
Mr. Hamza.
Please, just hold on.

50:53.130 --> 50:54.922
- We can do this business.
- No, no.

50:59.755 --> 51:03.130
Look at what you are doing,
all this stupid business.

51:03.213 --> 51:05.838
Tarnishing the image
of the Igbo people.

51:05.922 --> 51:08.064
Why don't you go to the secretariat
and look for a job?

51:08.088 --> 51:09.963
Change your clothes and go into farming.

51:10.047 --> 51:12.797
Agriculture is thriving right now.

51:13.505 --> 51:15.797
Go and farm.
You are painting us black.

51:15.880 --> 51:16.880
Aren't you ashamed?

51:20.130 --> 51:21.255
No, no. no.

51:26.880 --> 51:29.463
Where are you going?

51:29.547 --> 51:32.047
Where are you going?
Have you become a security man?

51:33.088 --> 51:35.248
You want to run away
after disrupting our deal?

51:36.213 --> 51:37.380
Let me tell you...

51:37.463 --> 51:40.130
We are all Igbo people.

51:41.338 --> 51:42.380
So, Ada...

51:43.672 --> 51:44.672
Ada?

51:44.880 --> 51:48.838
You will have to pay us
30% of the money.

51:49.380 --> 51:50.213
Really?

51:52.088 --> 51:54.047
Yes. You hit him well.

51:54.297 --> 51:56.137
- Ada-nna.
- Uncle, we need to go.

51:56.213 --> 51:57.130
Yeah, good idea.

51:57.213 --> 51:59.505
Remain on the ground.
Stupid man.

52:41.547 --> 52:42.547
Director.

52:43.005 --> 52:44.588
Hello, sir, good afternoon.

52:44.797 --> 52:47.963
I was just coming to see you.
Did you get my e-mails?

52:48.088 --> 52:50.755
- Yes, yes I did.
- Okay.

52:52.463 --> 52:53.838
But unfortunately,

52:54.380 --> 52:56.463
there's little I can do right now.

52:56.755 --> 52:59.922
The EFCC is investigating us as we speak.

53:00.963 --> 53:03.797
The Perm Sec has been placed
on compulsory leave,

53:04.672 --> 53:08.047
and between you and me,
he's not coming back.

53:08.172 --> 53:10.088
So, as it stands now,

53:11.005 --> 53:15.172
I don't have idea of the fate
of the BRT project.

53:18.338 --> 53:19.255
Oh, my God.

53:19.338 --> 53:23.297
It's only God that can save us
from this mess.

53:27.505 --> 53:28.672
Thank you.

53:33.213 --> 53:36.047
Madam, I'm very sorry.

53:36.505 --> 53:38.213
My apologies to your father.

53:40.547 --> 53:43.005
This is the change we all believe in.

54:21.297 --> 54:22.588
Good morning, Ma.

55:46.172 --> 55:47.963
Hello. Onyinye?

55:48.047 --> 55:50.172
Is anything wrong?

55:50.422 --> 55:52.255
She didn't come to work?

55:56.630 --> 55:58.338
Leave me alone.

56:00.963 --> 56:02.297
I'm not hungry.

56:02.755 --> 56:04.380
My friend, I'm coming in.

56:05.130 --> 56:06.130
Mummy?

56:06.338 --> 56:07.338
Yes, dear.

56:07.922 --> 56:09.880
I heard you didn't go to work.

56:10.047 --> 56:12.005
I'm not feeling well.

56:13.005 --> 56:14.255
You're not feeling well.

56:16.713 --> 56:18.672
Onyinye called me.

56:22.963 --> 56:24.713
I'm so tired, mummy.

56:26.463 --> 56:27.505
I'm exhausted.

56:29.755 --> 56:31.588
What is really the problem?

56:34.463 --> 56:36.588
I can't get an extension on the loans.

56:37.255 --> 56:39.338
BRT contract is not forthcoming.

56:40.338 --> 56:41.463
And if this...

56:41.547 --> 56:44.463
Igwe Pascal man gets a hold
of our company,

56:44.547 --> 56:45.880
everyone will lose their jobs.

56:46.838 --> 56:50.297
And they are depending on me,
and I feel like I'm failing.

56:51.963 --> 56:55.797
You have not started
and you feel like such a failure?

56:59.338 --> 57:03.088
Do you know what your father
put into setting up this company?

57:03.630 --> 57:07.505
The challenges, the mistakes, the failures
he had to face?

57:07.588 --> 57:09.297
And yet he made it.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.130
What is it they say?

57:11.213 --> 57:12.797
It's not over till it's over.

57:12.880 --> 57:16.213
Yes but, mummy, I'm running out of ideas.
I don't know what to do.

57:18.713 --> 57:23.255
God never gives you a burden
he has not equipped you to carry.

57:30.255 --> 57:31.297
What should I do?

57:32.672 --> 57:33.672
What can I do?

57:35.755 --> 57:40.588
You have your father's business brains.
You're a businesswoman.

57:40.672 --> 57:43.005
Do away with the sentiments
and the emotions.

57:44.130 --> 57:46.380
And get the job done. You have it in you.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.297
Dig deep and get it.

57:48.963 --> 57:51.922
You've always been able to do
anything you put your mind to.

57:52.255 --> 57:53.588
You can do this.

57:58.463 --> 57:59.505
Thank you, mummy.

58:01.630 --> 58:03.838
You can do this, you're gonna be alright.

58:05.463 --> 58:08.713
Listen, get dressed, come to the house

58:08.838 --> 58:10.547
and let's have a nice meal.

58:10.672 --> 58:14.172
Your auntie Chioma is around
and she's been asking for you.

58:14.255 --> 58:15.630
- She is?
- Yeah.

58:15.713 --> 58:18.088
She came to see her husband.
You know those two,

58:18.172 --> 58:21.047
they never stay away from each other
for too long.

58:21.672 --> 58:23.463
Come on, get dressed.

58:23.880 --> 58:26.547
- Okay, I'll see you there.
- Alright.

58:43.338 --> 58:44.255
Good evening.

58:44.338 --> 58:46.713
- Oh, Ada-nna.
- Aunty.

58:49.588 --> 58:51.505
Ada...
You are looking beautiful.

58:51.797 --> 58:52.797
Thank you.

58:54.130 --> 58:55.047
What?

58:55.130 --> 58:56.880
She looks tiny.
Are you people feeding her?

58:56.963 --> 58:59.963
Can't you see food everywhere?
You ask if she is being fed.

59:00.047 --> 59:02.588
Don't allow your father and uncle
to tear you apart.

59:02.672 --> 59:03.547
Take it easy.

59:03.630 --> 59:05.510
Please don't blame anybody.
She goes to the gym.

59:06.672 --> 59:07.505
Gym?

59:07.630 --> 59:09.838
Fashion. That's the trend these days.

59:09.922 --> 59:10.922
Fitness.

59:17.047 --> 59:20.588
I heard the first daughter of John Bosco

59:21.172 --> 59:23.130
is getting married next month.

59:24.713 --> 59:28.255
John Bosco looked at his son-in-law

59:28.547 --> 59:30.130
and felt he looked really skinny.

59:31.380 --> 59:34.505
He then asked him,

59:34.588 --> 59:37.505
"Can you take care of my daughter
looking this way?"

59:39.380 --> 59:41.130
He replied,

59:41.713 --> 59:44.922
"My in-law, it is all in God's hands."

59:45.422 --> 59:47.380
John Bosco replied, "I have heard you."

59:47.755 --> 59:49.922
Let me tell you the truth…

59:50.005 --> 59:52.422
You don't understand
what the son-in-law meant...

59:52.505 --> 59:55.297
The God he was referring to,
was John Bosco.

59:55.380 --> 59:57.463
He will call him God-John Bosco
if you let him.

59:58.005 --> 59:58.880
It's not a lie.

59:58.963 --> 01:00:01.047
That's young men of today.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:04.338
Saying it is in the hands of God implies
it is in the hands of John Bosco.

01:00:04.422 --> 01:00:05.463
John Bosco is God.

01:00:05.547 --> 01:00:07.755
Let me tell you,
that's what we suffer nowadays.

01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:12.838
When a young man wants to marry...

01:00:14.422 --> 01:00:19.588
he'll first ask around
if the parents are wealthy.

01:00:19.922 --> 01:00:22.963
If both the parents are not wealthy,
he disappears.

01:00:23.963 --> 01:00:25.005
He's gone.

01:00:26.338 --> 01:00:29.547
My sister, it is just tiring.
It's too much.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.005
That's how a child will carry on something
too heavy to handle.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:37.547
My dear, if such a man comes for you...
run!

01:00:37.713 --> 01:00:40.797
Make sure your feet hit your ears
as you run.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.240
It is not that you see a man
and start running...

01:00:44.255 --> 01:00:47.713
because you might be in this sort of race
and run past your future husband...

01:00:47.797 --> 01:00:49.713
then, we won't get to drink
on your wedding day.

01:00:50.463 --> 01:00:54.047
How it is done is that, first,
you study the man...

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:59.838
if he is a reasonable person,
you accept him.

01:00:59.963 --> 01:01:05.338
But if it's any of those men that sag
their trousers to their knees...

01:01:05.505 --> 01:01:06.630
Run!

01:01:07.255 --> 01:01:12.213
Because these children feel like
they are of marriageable age...

01:01:12.463 --> 01:01:15.880
"If a child tried to tie a wrapper
before maturity, when the wind comes...

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:19.255
It will blow him away along
with the wrapper."

01:01:21.005 --> 01:01:25.338
Obiora, you have heard what they said.
What do you want to do with your life?

01:01:27.422 --> 01:01:29.380
What sort of question is that?

01:01:29.463 --> 01:01:31.047
He asked you a question.

01:01:31.422 --> 01:01:33.713
So the music I am into isn't
beneficial to my life?

01:01:33.797 --> 01:01:37.713
I'm a musician. You've always known
this is what I do.

01:01:41.172 --> 01:01:42.922
Music is your choice of profession?

01:01:44.047 --> 01:01:45.922
You know you are Igbo?

01:01:46.463 --> 01:01:48.838
Essentially, every day you move around
with an instrument

01:01:48.922 --> 01:01:50.172
all in the name of music?

01:01:50.255 --> 01:01:51.735
Was Osadebe not an Igbo man?

01:01:54.005 --> 01:01:56.130
Is it not his music you always play
in this house?

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.588
Chief, he got you there!

01:01:58.422 --> 01:01:59.422
You win.

01:02:01.297 --> 01:02:03.213
You win, before I choke.

01:02:03.297 --> 01:02:06.630
At least I have not gone to jail
like Ada and Uncle Goddy.

01:02:07.338 --> 01:02:08.630
Leave me out of it.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.880
Obiora,

01:02:11.672 --> 01:02:12.880
you cannot go to jail.

01:02:13.755 --> 01:02:16.172
You look like
a new baby's bath water.

01:02:16.255 --> 01:02:19.005
If you go to jail,
will you come out alive?

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.213
See your beard looking
like that of Nebuchadnezzar.

01:02:23.297 --> 01:02:25.713
It will be the first thing they shave
with a bottle.

01:02:25.797 --> 01:02:28.005
At least I look like my father
with the beard.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.755
You know I support you,
but I'm just telling you the truth.

01:02:32.838 --> 01:02:35.713
Are you saying I don't work hard?

01:02:35.797 --> 01:02:38.547
Please, let's eat, before I choke
on pepper.

01:02:44.463 --> 01:02:45.547
Hi daddy.

01:02:45.922 --> 01:02:47.547
Ada, how are you?

01:02:48.922 --> 01:02:50.380
I'm good.

01:02:51.213 --> 01:02:52.213
How are you?

01:02:54.797 --> 01:02:57.005
Well, I am grateful to God for my life.

01:02:59.338 --> 01:03:01.672
But you see there comes a time
in the life of a man

01:03:01.755 --> 01:03:03.422
when he decides to take stock.

01:03:04.963 --> 01:03:09.338
I've come to realize that most men
invest all their time

01:03:10.755 --> 01:03:13.547
in matters of transient value,

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:18.297
at the expense of what they should
cherish,

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.505
what they should value,

01:03:21.713 --> 01:03:22.755
like love,

01:03:23.797 --> 01:03:24.797
life,

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.380
family.

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:32.297
I waited eight years for you to be born.

01:03:34.463 --> 01:03:36.672
Those were years of trepidation.

01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:43.630
And you came and you became a source
of pride and joy to me.

01:03:44.838 --> 01:03:46.630
I have watched you grow,

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:50.755
and I'm so confident in your ability.

01:03:52.338 --> 01:03:53.922
The biggest legacy...

01:03:54.838 --> 01:03:56.963
I would leave for posterity...

01:03:58.213 --> 01:03:59.213
is you.

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:01.172
My daughter.

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:04.630
I'm not thinking about death, but...

01:04:06.047 --> 01:04:09.005
Marie Connely said, "In the midst of life
we are in death,"

01:04:09.088 --> 01:04:13.755
so occasionally when we talk about life,
there's always death hovering around.

01:04:14.005 --> 01:04:17.672
You are the pendulum of my life.

01:04:18.547 --> 01:04:20.255
If you stop swinging,

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:22.297
then I am done.

01:04:23.547 --> 01:04:27.297
I'm proud of you. You mean so much to me.
Come on. Come on.

01:04:30.338 --> 01:04:31.755
Thank you, daddy.

01:04:32.463 --> 01:04:34.672
I'm proud of you, I'm proud of you.

01:04:35.297 --> 01:04:37.880
I'm proud of you. Yeah. Sit down.

01:05:55.463 --> 01:05:56.713
Please help me.

01:05:56.797 --> 01:05:59.630
Madam, if you want to go
straight to Lagos, get into the bus.

01:05:59.713 --> 01:06:02.463
But if you intend on stopping in Sagamu,
then go to Lionheart.

01:06:02.547 --> 01:06:05.963
This bus is going straight to Lagos.
We are not stopping over at Sagamu.

01:06:06.047 --> 01:06:09.088
Why will you tell me to go to Lionheart
and pay 6,000 Naira

01:06:09.172 --> 01:06:11.338
when my destination is Sagamu?
Am I going to Lagos?

01:06:12.338 --> 01:06:13.338
Madam.

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:16.314
Since you knew you were going to Sagamu,
you should have come here on time.

01:06:16.338 --> 01:06:18.564
The vehicles that travel to Sagamu
left the park already.

01:06:18.588 --> 01:06:22.880
If you want to go to Lagos, then get
into the bus. If not, please leave.

01:06:22.963 --> 01:06:27.255
This is the Peace Express to Lagos.
We don't make multiple stops.

01:06:29.755 --> 01:06:31.672
- Morning, morning.
- Morning, Ma.

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:33.255
Not now. Get the GM.

01:06:33.338 --> 01:06:36.005
I want all available drivers assembled
in the meeting hall. Now.

01:06:36.088 --> 01:06:37.547
- Okay.
- Morning.

01:06:38.588 --> 01:06:40.338
They're faster.

01:06:41.047 --> 01:06:43.005
We can't navigate those narrow roads.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.672
Ask the small bus drivers,
they know!

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:51.922
The small buses are
always at full capacity.

01:06:53.713 --> 01:06:55.713
Our fares are too expensive.

01:06:55.797 --> 01:06:57.880
How much is it?

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.880
Our big buses cannot compete.

01:07:00.963 --> 01:07:04.172
Not on speed, routes, rates... nothing!

01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:07.755
Our passengers are becoming impatient.

01:07:10.547 --> 01:07:13.463
The small bus companies
are killing us right now.

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:25.963
To reduce our rates,
we should invest in small buses.

01:08:07.463 --> 01:08:08.838
Ada-nna.

01:08:11.047 --> 01:08:13.963
You look moody. Why?

01:08:16.005 --> 01:08:17.171
Let's just say...

01:08:17.505 --> 01:08:20.130
I now understand what you've
been talking about all this while.

01:08:21.796 --> 01:08:24.255
Well, I'm happy you eventually realize it.

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:28.337
The major thing is to understand
at your own time. It's good.

01:08:30.046 --> 01:08:32.212
Where we going to get small buses from?

01:08:32.962 --> 01:08:35.505
We can't afford to buy any more buses
at this time.

01:08:35.587 --> 01:08:37.880
Yes, we can't afford to buy it,
but where...

01:08:38.296 --> 01:08:39.755
we can achieve it.

01:08:42.046 --> 01:08:43.046
You know.

01:08:44.837 --> 01:08:46.630
I talked to you once.

01:08:50.755 --> 01:08:52.087
Maikano Motors.

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:55.587
They have been looking for a way
to enter the East.

01:08:56.505 --> 01:09:01.046
Maybe if we push for the merger
with them, it's solved.

01:09:03.796 --> 01:09:06.796
Maikano Motors is a very big transport
company, uncle.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880
I know.

01:09:08.255 --> 01:09:10.630
I don't know if they'll go with the idea
of a merger.

01:09:11.087 --> 01:09:12.087
Why not?

01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:14.439
Listen, this is one thing
that they have been looking for,

01:09:14.462 --> 01:09:16.462
for a very long time, to enter the East.

01:09:17.171 --> 01:09:20.880
Preferably with a reputable
and big transport company,

01:09:20.962 --> 01:09:22.087
which we are.

01:09:22.587 --> 01:09:23.587
So...

01:09:24.171 --> 01:09:25.587
They find what they're looking for,

01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:28.712
and they have the small buses
we are looking for, so...

01:09:28.796 --> 01:09:31.505
"Since the food is delicious,
the soup looks good,

01:09:31.587 --> 01:09:33.587
what stops the visitor from eating?"

01:09:37.462 --> 01:09:38.587
Okay.

01:09:39.837 --> 01:09:41.255
I think it's worth a try.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.380
Good.

01:09:42.962 --> 01:09:45.296
I'll get them to set up a meeting
and then we'll...

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.880
No, no, no, no...

01:09:48.087 --> 01:09:50.505
- Don't be so fast, Ada.
- What?

01:09:50.587 --> 01:09:53.171
[in Hausa "You need to
take out the log of wood from the top

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:54.963
before the one below."

01:09:55.047 --> 01:09:57.005
If you understand my gist.

01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:00.713
- No, no, no!
- Odogwu...

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:03.588
Nobody will take my company
away from me. Nobody! No.

01:10:03.672 --> 01:10:06.463
It is a merger. Nobody's taking
your company away from you.

01:10:06.547 --> 01:10:09.880
What is the difference between a merger,
and what Igwe Pascal propose? Tell me.

01:10:09.963 --> 01:10:11.672
Well, Igwe Pascal wants to buy us out.

01:10:11.755 --> 01:10:14.155
And we both know that will be the end
of Lionheart if he did.

01:10:14.213 --> 01:10:15.255
But with a merger

01:10:15.338 --> 01:10:16.630
with Maikano we can still,

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.630
have some sort of control
over our destiny.

01:10:18.713 --> 01:10:21.505
Chief, listen to what
your daughter is saying.

01:10:21.588 --> 01:10:25.422
Listen to her.
We have run out of options completely.

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:27.922
They will not grant us extension
on this loan.

01:10:28.005 --> 01:10:31.422
And no bankers want to give us
any other loan as it stands now.

01:10:31.713 --> 01:10:36.047
So it's either Maikano, or Igwe Pascal,
which we don't want.

01:10:37.172 --> 01:10:38.213
And, they are Hausa?

01:10:38.297 --> 01:10:40.922
Daddy, come on, this is business.

01:10:42.088 --> 01:10:43.088
Alright.

01:10:43.755 --> 01:10:46.713
What if Maikano does not accept
our terms? You tell me.

01:10:46.797 --> 01:10:48.797
Oh, daddy, leave that to me.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880
Leave that to us.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.713
"Throw the bone to us dogs and leave
the fight to us and the spirits."

01:10:54.047 --> 01:10:56.422
We can do it. You have said it yourself.

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:01.422
Odogwu.

01:11:03.172 --> 01:11:04.172
Yeah.

01:11:13.463 --> 01:11:16.463
...such as for...

01:11:19.505 --> 01:11:20.880
...we request...

01:11:27.213 --> 01:11:29.005
They have to apply... the application...

01:11:29.088 --> 01:11:30.255
Sorry to interrupt you.

01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:33.088
You remember me?

01:11:34.463 --> 01:11:36.588
The house with the pool
with all the women.

01:11:37.297 --> 01:11:39.838
- House with the pool...
- You saved me from being duped

01:11:39.922 --> 01:11:41.922
by those fraudsters.

01:11:43.338 --> 01:11:44.630
- How are you?
- I'm very well.

01:11:44.713 --> 01:11:45.922
It's a small world.

01:11:46.005 --> 01:11:48.588
Hey, you know, I never got a chance
to thank you the other day.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.463
- Yes.
- I'm glad I have the opportunity

01:11:50.547 --> 01:11:52.523
- to express my gratitude now.
- No, you don't need

01:11:52.547 --> 01:11:55.505
to worry yourself. Just do good
to any human being you see anywhere

01:11:55.588 --> 01:11:57.828
because you never know what tomorrow
will turn out to be.

01:11:58.130 --> 01:12:00.314
- You're right. Thank you very much.
- It turned out well.

01:12:00.338 --> 01:12:01.338
Thank you.

01:12:02.422 --> 01:12:05.297
Sorry. Meet my niece. Adaeze.

01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:08.630
- It's a pleasure.
- Pleased to meet you.

01:12:11.088 --> 01:12:12.547
So where are you both headed?

01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:14.630
We are... actually, we're going to Kano.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.755
Oh wow. I hope all is well.

01:12:17.047 --> 01:12:21.130
All is well. We want to meet...

01:12:21.547 --> 01:12:23.838
one business mogul in Kano.

01:12:24.255 --> 01:12:26.713
You know, Alhaji Maikano.

01:12:26.838 --> 01:12:29.088
Want to see if we can strike a deal
with him.

01:12:29.172 --> 01:12:30.380
Have you met him before?

01:12:30.463 --> 01:12:33.713
No, no, no, no. But I intend to see him
when I get to Kano.

01:12:33.922 --> 01:12:35.005
- Wow.
- Yes.

01:12:35.547 --> 01:12:38.755
Well, let me introduce myself.
My name is Hamza Maikano.

01:12:39.422 --> 01:12:41.005
- Hamza who?
- Yes.

01:12:41.088 --> 01:12:44.422
The man over there is my father.
Alhaji Danladi Maikano.

01:12:45.047 --> 01:12:46.963
Maikano of Maikano Transport?

01:12:47.047 --> 01:12:47.880
Yes.

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:49.922
- What?
- We are actually on our way to Kano.

01:12:50.047 --> 01:12:53.297
So you can come with us.
I will make an introduction.

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:57.755
- And I can help you with your bags.
- Yes, yes.

01:12:57.838 --> 01:12:58.838
Wow!

01:13:36.672 --> 01:13:38.297
Not now, uncle, wait.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.547
Ada-nna.

01:13:39.755 --> 01:13:44.713
You will discuss with this man
alone. I will stay on the flank.

01:13:45.672 --> 01:13:47.523
But uncle, we are meant to be
in this together.

01:13:47.547 --> 01:13:48.838
I know we are in this together.

01:13:48.922 --> 01:13:51.203
But look, you are a leader.
He sees a leader.

01:13:51.255 --> 01:13:52.963
Leadership is not easy.

01:13:53.255 --> 01:13:54.922
Talk with him one on one.

01:13:55.005 --> 01:13:56.922
The head of one organization

01:13:57.005 --> 01:13:59.088
versus the head
of the other organization.

01:13:59.172 --> 01:14:02.297
Go, don't be scared. I am around.

01:14:02.505 --> 01:14:03.505
Okay.

01:14:04.213 --> 01:14:05.463
Don't be scared.

01:14:10.255 --> 01:14:12.047
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, thank you.

01:14:33.463 --> 01:14:35.047
Do have a seat, Miss Obiagu.

01:14:35.588 --> 01:14:37.338
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:40.047
So, how is your father?

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:44.838
I've not met him,
but he has quite a reputation.

01:14:45.422 --> 01:14:48.047
Well, he's doing very well.
Thank you for asking.

01:14:48.297 --> 01:14:49.797
So what can I do for you?

01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:55.297
Well, sir, I'm aware you are trying
to enter the Eastern region.

01:14:56.255 --> 01:14:57.755
Well, I'm here to let you know

01:14:57.838 --> 01:15:02.463
Lionheart Transport is willing to make
your transition a smooth one.

01:15:03.255 --> 01:15:04.255
Really?

01:15:06.505 --> 01:15:10.713
Yes, we have a fleet of 200 buses

01:15:10.838 --> 01:15:13.838
and cater to over 50,000 people weekly,

01:15:13.963 --> 01:15:17.422
not to mention 30 years of experience
that we have under our belt.

01:15:18.463 --> 01:15:20.463
So I think that...

01:15:21.047 --> 01:15:26.505
if there was some sort of merger
between your company and ours,

01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:29.422
I think the sky will be the limit, sir.

01:15:31.005 --> 01:15:33.838
That sounds like a well-rehearsed
pitch, my dear.

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:36.838
It's not a pitch, sir.

01:15:37.588 --> 01:15:41.755
Then convince me. Why should my company
match with yours?

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:51.880
Well, sir...

01:15:54.255 --> 01:15:55.797
I grew up in a bus park.

01:15:56.547 --> 01:15:59.713
My father started taking me to work
way before I could crawl.

01:16:02.547 --> 01:16:04.255
I saw people come and go,

01:16:05.963 --> 01:16:08.172
each with their own different agendas.

01:16:09.463 --> 01:16:10.463
You see,

01:16:10.797 --> 01:16:14.255
family is a core value
upon which Lionheart was built.

01:16:15.755 --> 01:16:19.088
I understood this early
and as I've grown older,

01:16:19.922 --> 01:16:23.713
I have realized that our growth is based
on how we treat others.

01:16:23.838 --> 01:16:25.838
The same way you have, sir.

01:16:30.255 --> 01:16:33.963
Your grandfather built Maikano Motors
65 years ago.

01:16:34.463 --> 01:16:38.255
Then he passed it on to your father
and now, you wear the crown.

01:16:40.588 --> 01:16:45.338
You do understand the importance
of succession and longevity.

01:16:47.047 --> 01:16:48.797
You've done quite some research.

01:16:50.213 --> 01:16:51.213
Sir.

01:16:56.130 --> 01:16:59.297
Maikano motors is one of the leading
transport companies.

01:16:59.922 --> 01:17:01.922
I mean with emphasis to the North.

01:17:02.297 --> 01:17:07.463
But, Lionheart Transportation is the heart
and the soul of the Southeast.

01:17:08.255 --> 01:17:09.922
My belief is that...

01:17:10.713 --> 01:17:12.213
with your capital

01:17:12.755 --> 01:17:14.172
and our technical know-how,

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.880
if we come together as one,

01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:22.213
we would be a force to be reckoned
within the transportation business.

01:17:23.047 --> 01:17:26.338
And not to mention...

01:17:27.255 --> 01:17:29.838
most importantly, we share
the same values.

01:17:36.463 --> 01:17:38.213
So, how did it go with my father?

01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:41.338
Reasonably well, I believe.

01:17:41.755 --> 01:17:45.422
Though he says he has to think on it,
so, fingers crossed.

01:17:45.505 --> 01:17:47.505
He's never been one
to make hasty decision.

01:17:47.672 --> 01:17:49.338
No, he said the same thing.

01:17:49.547 --> 01:17:53.255
But I really do believe that this would be
a mutually beneficial deal

01:17:53.338 --> 01:17:54.755
if it does go through.

01:17:55.213 --> 01:17:56.922
I... I think so too.

01:18:00.838 --> 01:18:02.297
So thank you.

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.922
I don't know if I have thanked you
for everything.

01:18:05.463 --> 01:18:08.213
We wouldn't have come this far
if you hadn't, you know...

01:18:08.297 --> 01:18:12.880
Stop. Stop thanking me. I know exactly
what it's like to be in your shoes.

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:15.672
Is that so? How come?

01:18:16.047 --> 01:18:19.047
You see, for starters, this isn't
just a business for you.

01:18:19.463 --> 01:18:20.713
This is personal.

01:18:22.047 --> 01:18:23.088
This is your family.

01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:28.255
This is about proving your worth to anyone
who matters, especially your dad.

01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:35.255
I know what it's like to be living
under their shadows.

01:18:36.005 --> 01:18:39.172
They've done so much for us on a platter,
and the only way...

01:18:39.255 --> 01:18:43.130
to pay them back is to show that we can
actually bring something to the table.

01:18:43.588 --> 01:18:47.255
How did you think I ended up in Enugu,
almost scammed in a business

01:18:47.338 --> 01:18:50.088
I hoped would solve our in-roads
to the East?

01:18:51.463 --> 01:18:54.380
I wanted to impress him so bad
and earn his respect.

01:18:55.672 --> 01:18:56.838
So yes, I understand.

01:18:57.130 --> 01:18:59.130
So no need to keep thanking me.

01:19:01.255 --> 01:19:03.213
I'm sure your father is proud of you.

01:19:05.047 --> 01:19:06.297
We have to be going.

01:19:06.505 --> 01:19:08.463
it's getting late and...

01:19:08.547 --> 01:19:11.023
we can't make the last flight
so we have to check into a hotel.

01:19:11.047 --> 01:19:13.106
- Can you rec...
- No, no, your things are in the car.

01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:15.922
I have instructed the driver to take you
to our guest house.

01:19:16.172 --> 01:19:19.588
- No, please, you've done enough already.
- I insist.

01:19:21.547 --> 01:19:22.547
Thank you.

01:19:23.922 --> 01:19:25.172
You're welcome.

01:19:26.713 --> 01:19:28.130
Thank you.

01:19:28.213 --> 01:19:32.672
Thank you so much and Alhaji
and we'll be hoping to hear from you.

01:19:32.755 --> 01:19:33.588
- It's okay.
- Yes.

01:19:33.672 --> 01:19:34.672
Alright, Adaeze.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.547
Did they provide transportation for us?

01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:38.713
Yes. It's taking us to their guest house.

01:19:38.797 --> 01:19:41.797
Thank you, Alhaji. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:20:39.338 --> 01:20:40.338
<i>Kola.</i>

01:20:46.047 --> 01:20:47.047
Thank you.

01:21:02.838 --> 01:21:04.672
What's going on?

01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:06.630
Nothing.

01:21:08.338 --> 01:21:11.838
Honestly, your father is so stubborn.

01:21:22.255 --> 01:21:23.755
I heard you're getting better.

01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:26.422
Of course I'm getting better.
Can't you see that?

01:21:26.672 --> 01:21:28.797
I'm not expected to die anytime soon.

01:21:29.255 --> 01:21:30.547
I'm getting better.

01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:51.713
The way things are turning out,
I'll have to sleep over in this town.

01:21:54.797 --> 01:21:57.672
If you need a place to stay,
I also have a guest house.

01:22:02.172 --> 01:22:03.422
You understand Hausa?

01:22:06.713 --> 01:22:08.713
I was born in Zaria.

01:22:08.797 --> 01:22:11.505
I studied there.

01:22:12.297 --> 01:22:14.797
We roamed the city.

01:22:21.213 --> 01:22:25.838
To be honest, I enjoyed the yoghurt...
and the millet cakes.

01:22:28.047 --> 01:22:28.963
That's surprising.

01:22:29.047 --> 01:22:30.297
It was us against the world.

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.814
You have to do something,
because we're going to...

01:22:32.838 --> 01:22:35.130
O... kay.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.130
I promise you, they weren't doing
that a minute ago.

01:22:41.588 --> 01:22:44.547
Ada-nna, why do you get
yourself worked up for nothing?

01:22:44.672 --> 01:22:46.797
They are laughing.
They are smiling, they are happy.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:47.880
I see that.

01:22:49.713 --> 01:22:51.505
No worries, let me join them.

01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:07.130
Right, I think it's about time
we started this meeting.

01:23:07.213 --> 01:23:09.838
- There's no point in waiting any longer.
- Yes.

01:23:09.963 --> 01:23:12.213
- Go ahead.
- Three billion now is not something,

01:23:12.297 --> 01:23:13.963
you know, to pass on.

01:23:16.755 --> 01:23:20.380
Not so fast, not so fast.

01:23:26.047 --> 01:23:27.797
Get out of this seat. Come on.

01:23:29.172 --> 01:23:30.547
- Out.
- Out of this seat.

01:23:32.213 --> 01:23:33.338
Please, sit.

01:23:34.255 --> 01:23:36.922
- Mr. Chairman, welcome.
- Thank you very much.

01:23:37.172 --> 01:23:38.172
Chief.

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.505
What a surprise, Sir.

01:23:40.713 --> 01:23:43.588
Yes, a wonderful surprise.

01:23:44.505 --> 01:23:45.838
Anybody who is on trial

01:23:46.838 --> 01:23:50.005
is offered an opportunity
to defend himself

01:23:50.338 --> 01:23:53.130
before his accusers, don't you think so?

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:57.588
Yes, Chief, but you are not
under any trial here sir.

01:23:58.088 --> 01:24:00.338
No, no, no. Come on, I'm under trial.

01:24:01.422 --> 01:24:02.713
You...

01:24:03.755 --> 01:24:06.255
you accused my family of...

01:24:07.922 --> 01:24:10.797
incompetence, of ineptitude,

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:14.547
and not satisfied with that,

01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:16.297
to make matters worse,

01:24:17.088 --> 01:24:22.422
you bring into my family this,
this poor chap, this, this, this rascal.

01:24:23.713 --> 01:24:24.713
Chief Obiagu,

01:24:25.713 --> 01:24:28.172
there is no need for name-calling here.

01:24:28.547 --> 01:24:30.297
This is business.

01:24:30.505 --> 01:24:31.588
No hard feelings.

01:24:32.963 --> 01:24:34.713
No hard feelings.

01:24:34.797 --> 01:24:37.505
Pascal, you're an animal.

01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:41.255
Insult me all you want. But...

01:24:42.463 --> 01:24:46.463
it will not change
what is about to happen here.

01:24:47.297 --> 01:24:50.005
My offer is up...

01:24:50.838 --> 01:24:53.130
and you have lost.

01:24:54.463 --> 01:24:57.838
If I were you, I wouldn't be too sure.

01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:05.130
You read it carefully.

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:07.172
Sorry, what, what, what's this?

01:25:07.255 --> 01:25:08.422
It might help if you read.

01:25:08.505 --> 01:25:11.880
Contract papers. We have a new offer
on the table.

01:25:16.963 --> 01:25:18.463
In the past 30 years,

01:25:18.922 --> 01:25:20.963
my family has...

01:25:22.297 --> 01:25:25.672
faced up to all sorts of challenges.

01:25:25.797 --> 01:25:27.838
We are faced with another challenge.

01:25:28.213 --> 01:25:31.130
The challenge, more trying this time,

01:25:32.047 --> 01:25:33.213
the challenge of change.

01:25:33.297 --> 01:25:36.463
This talks about expansion.

01:25:38.547 --> 01:25:41.130
You don't have the capital for that.

01:25:42.463 --> 01:25:43.463
You think so?

01:25:43.547 --> 01:25:44.922
Yes, I know so.

01:25:45.047 --> 01:25:46.047
Adaeze.

01:25:46.422 --> 01:25:48.880
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce to you

01:25:48.963 --> 01:25:50.963
the newest shareholder of Lionheart.

01:25:53.005 --> 01:25:56.797
Alhaji Danladi Maikano,
and his son, Hamza.

01:25:57.213 --> 01:25:58.213
That's impossible.

01:25:58.672 --> 01:25:59.672
Really?

01:26:01.172 --> 01:26:05.380
We've struck a deal with Maikano Motors,
to combine our fleet.

01:26:05.588 --> 01:26:07.255
If you look at the contracts before you,

01:26:07.755 --> 01:26:11.297
you will see that this is a mutually
beneficial merger.

01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:15.255
One that allows us to explore
and expand beyond the shores

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:17.297
without having to buy small buses.

01:26:17.755 --> 01:26:19.213
But, most importantly,

01:26:19.755 --> 01:26:24.297
it allows us to retain
control of Lionheart.

01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:29.213
Beautiful. Wonderful.

01:26:32.047 --> 01:26:33.172
This is...

01:26:33.547 --> 01:26:36.255
absolute rubbish.

01:26:39.838 --> 01:26:40.838
Sam.

01:26:41.297 --> 01:26:42.497
Are you still here?

01:26:42.922 --> 01:26:45.047
...Get up! And out.
- Your continued stay

01:26:45.130 --> 01:26:47.505
is an extension of your irrelevance.

01:26:48.547 --> 01:26:49.963
Could you leave, please?

01:26:52.547 --> 01:26:53.922
Beautiful baby.

01:26:55.088 --> 01:26:56.838
Beautiful baby.

01:27:00.338 --> 01:27:01.338
Please.

01:27:11.422 --> 01:27:12.505
Welcome, Maikano.

01:27:12.588 --> 01:27:14.505
Thank you, my brother.

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:18.963
At this point, I must have to make
an announcement.

01:27:21.338 --> 01:27:24.380
I want to retire from my position

01:27:24.963 --> 01:27:27.255
of MD and CEO

01:27:28.047 --> 01:27:29.505
of this company.

01:27:29.963 --> 01:27:33.713
I think I have groomed a successor,

01:27:34.255 --> 01:27:36.505
my daughter Adaeze,

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:39.547
because I believe she has all the virtues

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:41.797
required to run this company.

01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:46.672
In order to ensure
that I am not inflicting her on you,

01:27:46.755 --> 01:27:50.047
you just must might put this to vote,
if you'd like to.

01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:52.356
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- But I recommend her heavily.

01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:53.505
Why not.

01:27:54.755 --> 01:27:56.672
All in support say "aye."

01:27:56.755 --> 01:27:58.088
Aye.

01:27:58.172 --> 01:27:59.880
The ayes have it.
There's no "nay."

01:28:05.463 --> 01:28:06.463
Well...

01:28:10.713 --> 01:28:13.963
- My daughter.
- Thank you, daddy.

01:28:17.672 --> 01:28:18.838
Ada-nna.

01:28:18.922 --> 01:28:20.338
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:22.505
Yes.

01:28:29.963 --> 01:28:30.963
May I?

01:28:33.422 --> 01:28:34.672
Congratulations.

01:28:48.588 --> 01:28:49.588
Hello.

01:28:56.088 --> 01:28:57.088
Hello.

01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:00.963
Alhaji. I hope you enjoy yourself.

01:29:01.047 --> 01:29:03.380
- I intend to enjoy myself.
- Beautiful.

01:29:08.005 --> 01:29:10.130
Can I get something...

01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:12.880
What is it? Okay.

01:29:19.338 --> 01:29:20.338
I'm tired.

01:29:21.838 --> 01:29:22.838
By the way,

01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:26.005
I want to change the carpet
in that office.

01:29:26.672 --> 01:29:29.213
That burgundy just does my head in.

01:29:29.963 --> 01:29:31.963
- Blue...
- I think you have an admirer, Ma.

01:29:32.047 --> 01:29:33.047
What?

01:29:39.922 --> 01:29:41.380
Stop staring, Onyinye.

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:46.880
Hi, Adaeze.

01:29:47.297 --> 01:29:48.838
Hamza, hi.

01:29:49.005 --> 01:29:50.005
How are you?

01:29:50.255 --> 01:29:53.547
Very well. Are you...
Are you having a good time?

01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:55.005
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:30:00.755 --> 01:30:03.047
I'm Onyinye. Leaving.

01:30:03.338 --> 01:30:04.338
Okay.

01:30:15.588 --> 01:30:18.630
I thought he's into hip-hop?

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:22.255
Is this going to be good?

01:30:22.588 --> 01:30:27.630
You don't know your son.
You'll soon see what he'll do.

01:30:35.672 --> 01:30:37.338
- My brother!
- Oh, okay.

01:30:37.422 --> 01:30:39.297
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

01:30:39.963 --> 01:30:44.463
First of all, I just want to say
a big congratulations to my dad...

01:30:44.547 --> 01:30:45.963
on his retirement.

01:30:49.588 --> 01:30:52.338
And I have a special song for you...

01:30:52.422 --> 01:30:54.422
It's titled Obiagu.

01:31:00.005 --> 01:31:01.005
Wow.

01:33:54.505 --> 01:33:55.922
Open the gate.

01:33:56.005 --> 01:33:58.005
You always underrate me!

01:33:58.755 --> 01:34:00.547
Isn't it the same work we do?

01:34:00.630 --> 01:34:02.880
Yet, you ask me to open the gate.

01:34:03.088 --> 01:34:04.755
Are you talking to me in that manner?

01:34:04.838 --> 01:34:06.922
It seems something is wrong with you.
