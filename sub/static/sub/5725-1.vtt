new breed of criminal--

hiding in the deep web.

But these guys are amazing.

01:26.870 --> 01:30.720
I mean, they've been around

01:42.060 --> 01:44.700
It communicates with
the roach's antenna.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.740
And then the whole thing
is controlled wirelessly.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.290
I mean, the possibilities
are endless.

01:48.290 --> 01:48.990
All right.

How much are these cyber

02:01.170 --> 02:04.640

Well, it's probably
for the best.

You took down three of

I'm not sure I'm ready to
become a member of the brass.

Our hacker could have simply
gone to the doll company

three burglaries and cashed in.

would have dismissed

34:37.790 --> 34:41.210
But there was one database
bursing with him info.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.350

34:47.420 --> 34:49.340
the chip is so sensitive
that it records

34:49.340 --> 34:50.470

So you're going to tell
us ow these vibrations

34:52.400 --> 34:54.080

- Yeah.

Well, those numbers
represent a vibration.

right to, left top the bottom--
