WEBVTT

02:14.592 --> 02:19.014
-We're being hailed. It'sâ€¦ Rex.

02:27.564 --> 02:32.402
Hello, boys. Sorry to cut right to it,
but I could use your help.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.987
What do you need, Captain?

02:34.070 --> 02:36.823
I received a distress signal
from a clone trooper,

02:36.906 --> 02:39.659
but I'm a bit tied up at the moment
to retrieve him.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.453
You want us to recover a reg?

02:41.536 --> 02:44.706
He's an old friend, and he's in trouble.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.083
I need you to get him out.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.795
Out of what exactly?

02:52.589 --> 02:55.592
Can't talk right now.
Sending you his signal. I'll be in touch.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.928
What was that about?

02:59.012 --> 03:04.392
The distress signal sent by CC-5576
is originating from Daro,

03:04.476 --> 03:08.355
a terrestrial planet in the Outer Rim with
no known settlements or installations.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.273
What's he doing all the way out there?

03:10.357 --> 03:11.608
Well, does it matter?

03:11.691 --> 03:14.361
We've gone on missions before
without much intel.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.862
But this would be stretching it.

03:15.945 --> 03:19.115
Rex wouldn't ask us for help
if it wasn't urgent.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.326
Echo's got a point.

03:21.409 --> 03:25.205
May I remind you that
we are in the middle of a job for Cid.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.916
If we deviate, we will not be compensated.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.918
No money means no food.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.254
Oh, yeah. Tech's got a point.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.215
But Rex's friend is in trouble.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.176
That's more important than getting paid.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.929
Well, the kid's got a point.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.563
Fine. We'll check things out.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.649
â€¦I don't like it.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.956
The operation is ahead of schedule.

04:08.540 --> 04:12.252
Good.
Ensure every viable clone is mobilized.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.052
And the Kaminoans?

04:21.886 --> 04:23.138
We have our orders.

04:24.139 --> 04:27.475
Keep an eye on themâ€¦
until the time is right.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.645
Mistress Nala Se,

04:30.729 --> 04:33.356
isn't leaving the facility
against protocol?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.984
Your training will continue elsewhere.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.987
We'll still be soldiers, won't we?

04:39.070 --> 04:43.033
Of course. That is what you were made for.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.541
You best hurry. I will join you later.

05:03.053 --> 05:06.222
The Empire has canceled
all of our contracts.

05:10.018 --> 05:14.230
Our success with the clone army
is known galaxy-wide.

05:14.814 --> 05:21.196
Surely, we will find other clients
who value our scientific advancements.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.407
The Empire is not like the Republic.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.744
We have empowered them
to our own detriment.

05:28.328 --> 05:33.750
I fear they will destroy us rather
than allow this operation to continue.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.754
We must leave to ensure our survival.

05:38.505 --> 05:42.926
Gather those essential.
I will arrange for our departure.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.222
Yes, Prime Minister.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.401
We are approaching Daro's atmosphere.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.570
I'll bring us in low to avoid
any possible tracking scanners.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.699
We're banking a lot on a clone
we don't even know.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.911
-Rex trusts him. And I trust Rex.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.351
The signal is coming from that direction.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.941
-The beacon should be right ahead.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.320
Found it.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.659
So, where's this reg?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.173
We're already too late.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.134
The clone was being hunted.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.470
He was dragged.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.680
That way.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.776
Hang on.

07:27.947 --> 07:32.243
There's something here,
inside that mountain.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.288
-I believe you are right.
-

07:35.372 --> 07:36.790
My scans are being jammed.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.501
You said there was nothing on this planet.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.795
That data appears to be inaccurate.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.963
Wrecker, you and Omega wait on the ship.

07:44.047 --> 07:44.881
Wait, why can't--

07:44.964 --> 07:48.802
Coming here was up for debate. This isn't.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.608
What is it?

08:05.235 --> 08:06.569
A shuttle landed here.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.075
What exactly is in that mountain?

08:12.158 --> 08:15.328
Only one way to find out.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.819
This looks like
some sort of military base.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.738
Not one that I've ever heard of.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.625
Come on. Let's get a closer look.

09:20.852 --> 09:24.647
I'm clocking a couple of commandos
and squads of clone troopers.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.650
And they've updated their armor.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.402
Let me see.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.405
The mountain's natural composition

09:32.489 --> 09:35.575
makes this base well-fortified
and nearly impenetrable.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.580
This is no longer
just a simple extraction.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.999
Let's get back to the Marauder
and leave word for Rex.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.877
But what about the mission?

09:47.629 --> 09:51.216
We do not know for certain
if CC-5576 is even in thereâ€¦

09:52.008 --> 09:53.843
or if he is still alive.

09:54.469 --> 09:57.055
We'd be going in blind
without any reinforcements.

09:57.806 --> 10:01.101
You did that on Skako Minor
when you rescued me.

10:01.184 --> 10:04.020
I'd still be trapped in that place
if you hadn't.

10:04.104 --> 10:08.149
If there's a chance that trooper's
being held against his will,

10:08.233 --> 10:10.235
we have to try to get him out.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.157
It's still your turn.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.577
-I know. I'm thinking.
-

10:19.661 --> 10:21.746
- Wrecker, do you copy?

10:21.830 --> 10:24.249
Yeah, we hear ya. Did you find the reg?

10:24.332 --> 10:25.667
Not yet.

10:25.750 --> 10:29.004
But we did find an Imperial base
built inside this mountain.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.630
We're going in.

10:30.714 --> 10:31.965
Wait for us!

10:32.048 --> 10:33.174
We'll help.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.678
Negative. Stay on the ship.
You're our backup.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.848
Comms will be jammed once we're inside,
so keep alert.

10:40.473 --> 10:45.645
I'll need to tap into the central database
to pinpoint CC-5576's location.

10:45.729 --> 10:49.274
There are entry points we can access
in the lift shaft. That's our way in.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.835
Get ready to jump.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.032
Anything?

11:39.115 --> 11:42.327
This encryption's new.
This might take a while.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.232
This doesn't make any sense.

12:12.315 --> 12:17.654
The muster report lists 50 clone
commandos and 1,000 TK troopers.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.988
TK trooper?

12:19.572 --> 12:21.533
I'm not familiar with that designation.

12:21.616 --> 12:22.784
How much longer?

12:22.867 --> 12:25.370
Almost got it.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.665
Found him. Cellblock 25, four levels down.

12:42.554 --> 12:47.142
Hey, newbie, how about you be useful?
Get me some food.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.019
Quiet, traitor!

12:49.102 --> 12:51.187
That's Captain Traitor.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.190
Insubordinate plebe.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.525
-

12:58.695 --> 13:00.572
Are you CC-5576?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.324
That depends. Who's askin'?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.577
- Rex sent us.

13:07.537 --> 13:12.292
In that case, the name's Gregor.
Now let's move out.

13:54.876 --> 13:58.296
They're gathered for inspection.
There's no way past 'em.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.132
If we can't reach the lifts,
we can't get out of here.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.467
I can redirect them.

14:05.970 --> 14:10.266
Armor like that,
I take it you're CCs like me?

14:10.809 --> 14:12.185
CT-99s.

14:15.730 --> 14:20.819
If you ask me, it's the ones who want
to stay here who are really defective.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.195
What was your assignment?

14:22.278 --> 14:25.448
-I was an instructor--
-

14:25.532 --> 14:26.741
What's going on, Tech?

14:26.825 --> 14:28.827
I keyed a Code-16
to redirect their forces.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.120
I don't know what happened.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.873
Clone codes don't work here.
You just triggered a security alert.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.711
Intruders on level six!

14:51.641 --> 14:53.184
Is there another way off this base?

14:53.268 --> 14:56.521
Only one way out. Up.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.482
Look at this.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.110
These are not clone troopers.

15:02.193 --> 15:05.238
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

15:05.321 --> 15:09.576
These are our replacements.
If you can believe that.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.347
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

15:30.430 --> 15:33.558
Hey, I'm the one who escaped here before.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.893
And you were captured.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.978
After I made it out.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.528
I thought you said
you trained these guys?

15:45.612 --> 15:49.532
I didn't teach them everything.
That wouldn't be very smart, would it?

16:05.674 --> 16:07.801
- We need an authorization code.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.427
Got it.

16:16.893 --> 16:21.773
These new troopers,
what do you mean they're our replacements?

16:21.856 --> 16:26.111
Well, we clones are soldiers
of a Republic that doesn't exist.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.780
These recruits come
from all over the galaxy.

16:28.863 --> 16:31.825
They swear loyalty to the Empire.

16:31.908 --> 16:35.495
They're not as skilled,
but there's an endless supply of 'em.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.330
Numbers aren't everything.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.755
You were saying?

16:46.506 --> 16:49.092
We'll, uh, take a detour.

16:59.144 --> 17:01.146
How can you be so relaxed?

17:01.229 --> 17:06.860
Oh, I'm preparing.
I'm chargin' up before I charge in.

17:07.402 --> 17:10.739
We should've heard from them by now.
What if something went wrong?

17:10.822 --> 17:13.575
I'm sure
they got everything under control.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.998
Hunter!

18:02.499 --> 18:04.209
- How bad?

18:04.292 --> 18:08.088
Ha! Don't worry about me. This is nothing.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.256
I got blown up once and survived.

18:13.343 --> 18:16.262
They have all access points
to the central ring blocked off.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.558
There. Those pipes are reactor conduits.

18:20.642 --> 18:21.685
And?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.771
Well, they should lead to
the main reactor's external exhaust port.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.315
That is our path to the outside.

18:27.399 --> 18:30.193
The exhaust vent's
halfway up the mountain.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.570
We can't survive that jump.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.240
No,
but we would be able to signal our ship.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.044
-

18:50.630 --> 18:53.049
How did you even end up in this place?

18:54.551 --> 18:56.720
I was sent here with other commandosâ€¦

18:57.929 --> 19:01.349
â€¦and quickly realized I wanted out.

19:02.851 --> 19:07.564
It turns out the Empire
doesn't take too kindly to desertion.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.066
Yeah, no kidding.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.197
- Wrecker, Omega, come in.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.824
-It's them!
-

19:17.907 --> 19:18.908
We read you, Hunter.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.411
We have the target,
but we ran into some trouble.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.163
-We need a pickup.
-On our way!

19:36.301 --> 19:38.136
They're escaping through the reactor port!

19:45.185 --> 19:48.396
Glad we're not going that way.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.190
- We are on approach!

19:51.191 --> 19:52.442
We see you.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.539
Keep it steady, kid.

20:06.623 --> 20:07.874
I'll do my best.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.882
Little closer!

20:18.968 --> 20:20.178
Come on!

20:30.438 --> 20:31.940
I can't hold it!

20:32.023 --> 20:33.858
That is sufficient.
I'll take it from here.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.235
Wrecker, get on the tail gun.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.137
Shields are down. We're losing power!

21:08.309 --> 21:10.145
Gonky, we need you!

21:15.442 --> 21:17.569
It's working! Systems are back online.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.716
We're coming back around. Be ready!

21:44.179 --> 21:45.096
Jump!

21:55.357 --> 21:56.566
Hunter!

22:18.672 --> 22:20.298
-Multiple system failures!

22:20.382 --> 22:22.801
We cannot take many more hits!

22:40.402 --> 22:42.237
-Get the ship out of here.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.322
I'll find another way back.

22:44.406 --> 22:47.200
Negative. The odds of escape
are not in your favor.

22:50.495 --> 22:53.456
Go, Tech! That's an order!

23:05.385 --> 23:09.180
No! Turn around!
We have to go back for him!

23:09.264 --> 23:13.101
Hunter, tell them to come back!
Order them to come back!

23:13.601 --> 23:16.604
Sorry, kid. I can't do that.

23:36.416 --> 23:39.085
Admiral, what can I do for you?

23:40.712 --> 23:42.797
I am disappointed, Prime Minister.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.217
You promised the Empire
your full cooperation.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.595
That is what I have given.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.430
Mmm.

23:50.513 --> 23:53.266
A disturbing matter
has been brought to my attention.

23:54.684 --> 23:59.856
Your Chief Scientist was gathering
medical personnel to flee Kamino.

24:00.899 --> 24:03.151
This is most surprising.

24:04.736 --> 24:07.906
I will ensure a proper punishment.

24:08.573 --> 24:12.077
While I never found your clone troopers
to be overly impressive,

24:12.160 --> 24:15.163
I do believe you will be of great service
to the Empire.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.291
A scientist, I have use for.

24:19.250 --> 24:22.170
A politician, I do not.

24:22.712 --> 24:25.215
I'm afraid
your services are no longer needed.

24:50.949 --> 24:53.034
I figured you'd show up.

24:57.997 --> 25:03.003
I was hoping for the whole squad,
but you'll do.
