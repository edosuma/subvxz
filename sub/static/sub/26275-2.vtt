WEBVTT

00:05.615 --> 00:07.417
Was that box here yesterday?

00:07.450 --> 00:09.252
I think these things
are multiplying.

00:09.286 --> 00:12.955
Yeah, well, your dad
did have a lot of stuff.

00:12.989 --> 00:14.524
I think the Egyptians
had it right; when they died,

00:14.557 --> 00:17.760
they were buried
with all their crap.

00:17.794 --> 00:19.195
You know, it's been
four months and you haven't

00:19.228 --> 00:20.397
even gone through this stuff.

00:20.430 --> 00:21.764
How do you know it's crap?

00:21.798 --> 00:23.065
Because it's my dad's.

00:24.901 --> 00:26.969
My garage is where I work
on my truck to de-stress.

00:27.003 --> 00:30.139
Now I can't do that. It's like
he did this on purpose.

00:30.172 --> 00:34.477
Oh, honey. I really don't think
your father died to prank you.

00:34.511 --> 00:35.878
I wouldn't put it past him.

00:35.912 --> 00:37.714
But joke's on him.

00:37.747 --> 00:40.583
Goodwill's coming this Saturday
to take all this stuff away.

00:40.617 --> 00:42.585
-Don't you want
to keep anything?
-No.

00:42.619 --> 00:44.721
Now, w-what about this? What
about his favorite chair, huh?

00:44.754 --> 00:47.156
I mean, every time I see it,
I imagine Bud sitting here,

00:47.189 --> 00:48.925
holding a glass of whiskey.

00:48.958 --> 00:50.293
Yeah.

00:50.327 --> 00:52.161
That's why it's going.

00:52.194 --> 00:54.631
I really think you should
keep something, just... here.

00:54.664 --> 00:56.299
I don't think--
whoa, wait a minute.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.402
(grunts):
How about this?

00:59.436 --> 01:02.505
His bowling shoes.

01:02.539 --> 01:05.675
Wasn't he wearing those the
night he had his heart attack?

01:05.708 --> 01:07.644
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:07.677 --> 01:10.613
So, obviously, they're lucky.

01:12.449 --> 01:14.451
*

01:19.221 --> 01:21.190
-Hey. What's cooking?
-Hi.

01:21.223 --> 01:22.425
Wow.

01:22.459 --> 01:24.160
And I mean that in both ways,

01:24.193 --> 01:26.262
as in, "What's new?"
and also the literal question,

01:26.295 --> 01:29.832
"What food are you preparing?"

01:29.866 --> 01:32.134
My God, you're exhausting.

01:32.168 --> 01:34.337
Shrimp scampi.
Do you want to stay?

01:34.371 --> 01:36.839
Farm-raised shrimp
or wild-caught?

01:36.873 --> 01:38.975
Trapped at the border.

01:40.643 --> 01:41.678
What's up?

01:41.711 --> 01:42.979
You know,
when I agreed to look after

01:43.012 --> 01:44.714
your dad's pot dispensary,

01:44.747 --> 01:47.384
didn't think there'd be
quite this much business stuff.

01:47.417 --> 01:50.487
So, that is the new lease,
the insurance premium schedule.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.121
Oh, and we had
a building inspection

01:52.154 --> 01:53.523
and we have
some structural issues,

01:53.556 --> 01:55.658
so when can you meet
with the city engineer?

01:55.692 --> 01:57.627
Look at all this stuff.
This is insane.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.328
Yeah. You're preaching
to the choir, man.

01:59.362 --> 02:02.899
All that paper is a leading
cause of deforestation.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.702
I hate this shop.

02:05.735 --> 02:08.671
Really? Wow,
you never mentioned it.

02:09.706 --> 02:11.207
All it attracts is potheads,

02:11.240 --> 02:13.676
just like the Democratic party.

02:15.077 --> 02:16.245
You know what? That's it.

02:16.278 --> 02:17.346
He's gone. That's it.

02:17.380 --> 02:19.416
Let's just get rid of all of it.

02:19.449 --> 02:20.750
Including Bud's Buds?

02:20.783 --> 02:22.051
You're damn right, Bud's Buds.

02:22.084 --> 02:23.720
I'll sell Bud's Buds.

02:23.753 --> 02:25.922
And if you act now,
I'll toss in a lumpy chair

02:25.955 --> 02:29.892
and 20 boxes of mystery crap.

02:29.926 --> 02:32.094
Wait, you want to sell the shop?
I work there.

02:32.128 --> 02:33.730
Okay. Act now,

02:33.763 --> 02:36.933
you get a slightly used,
irritating son-in-law.

02:42.138 --> 02:44.541
Pardon me, I'm new in town.

02:44.574 --> 02:47.209
Is there where a poor gal
might find work?

02:47.243 --> 02:50.613
Yes, ma'am. And you're in luck,
because I do the hiring.

02:50.647 --> 02:52.081
And you're married to me.

02:52.915 --> 02:54.183
Let's start your interview.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.618
(chuckles)
Kyle, you're so funny.

02:55.652 --> 02:57.420
I've never had to interview
for a job.

02:57.454 --> 02:59.622
Oh, yeah.
I always forget you're hot.

02:59.656 --> 03:04.393
So, how was your first day
in the personnel department?

03:04.427 --> 03:06.829
Great. I think
I'm getting the hang of it.

03:09.899 --> 03:12.435
Sorry, Brenda. It's just me.

03:12.469 --> 03:13.970
Again.

03:16.506 --> 03:18.775
You seem nervous.

03:18.808 --> 03:20.543
I feel a little out of place.

03:20.577 --> 03:22.712
I mean, look at these people.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.981
Everybody's dressed
like a lawyer.

03:25.014 --> 03:27.383
Especially the lawyers.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.052
Ooh, we could upgrade your look.
The rule of thumb

03:30.086 --> 03:32.789
is that you should always dress
for the job you want.

03:32.822 --> 03:36.125
Oh, no. I can't come to work
dressed like an astronaut.

03:37.594 --> 03:39.161
You are married

03:39.195 --> 03:41.297
to an up-and-coming
fashion designer, Kyle.

03:41.330 --> 03:42.765
And I'm gonna give you a look

03:42.799 --> 03:44.767
that will fill you
with confidence.

03:44.801 --> 03:47.269
Yeah. Confidence.

03:47.303 --> 03:49.005
I like the sound of that.

03:50.973 --> 03:52.975
Sorry, Brenda.

03:53.009 --> 03:55.778
-Hey, Dad. You busy?
-MIKE: Hey.

03:55.812 --> 03:56.946
Always.

03:56.979 --> 03:58.247
Can I talk to you anyway?

03:58.280 --> 03:59.816
Always.

03:59.849 --> 04:02.952
So, uh, Ryan told me

04:02.985 --> 04:05.154
that you're thinking
of selling the pot shop.

04:05.187 --> 04:07.524
I'm not thinking about it.
I'm selling the pot shop.

04:07.557 --> 04:10.627
Okay. Well, uh,
I know that you're too busy

04:10.660 --> 04:12.495
to deal with it,
so Ryan and I decided

04:12.529 --> 04:14.430
that we could take over
all the responsibilities.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.999
That way you don't have to sell.

04:17.033 --> 04:18.434
Do you or Ryan know

04:18.467 --> 04:21.437
how complicated
the drug business is?

04:21.470 --> 04:24.406
I know business, okay?
I run the Grill.

04:25.407 --> 04:26.776
With your help.

04:26.809 --> 04:28.711
Okay. How about this?

04:28.745 --> 04:30.012
You're looking
at a financial statement.

04:30.046 --> 04:31.347
Do you know the difference

04:31.380 --> 04:34.551
between accrual basis
and cash basis?

04:34.584 --> 04:38.287
Well, they're both basis... es.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.022
Only...

04:40.056 --> 04:42.024
you know, different.

04:42.058 --> 04:44.060
Look, I appreciate your help,
but you guys can't run it alone,

04:44.093 --> 04:45.361
and I'm not gonna do it.

04:45.394 --> 04:47.664
Dad, it's Grandpa's.

04:47.697 --> 04:49.566
Well, Grandpa's not here.

04:49.599 --> 04:53.235
He's at that big hookah bar
in the sky.

04:53.269 --> 04:55.071
But it meant the world to him.

04:55.104 --> 04:56.906
H-He told me it was his legacy.

04:56.939 --> 04:58.975
You know what?
I want the Baxter legacy

04:59.008 --> 05:01.010
to be the love
of the great outdoors,

05:01.043 --> 05:05.414
not a strain of weed
named after Miley Cyrus.

05:05.447 --> 05:06.883
So you're just gonna
throw it all away?

05:06.916 --> 05:08.751
After all of his hard work?

05:08.785 --> 05:10.720
I don't know what to tell you,
kiddo. We have to get rid of it.

05:10.753 --> 05:13.055
No, we don't have to.
You want to.

05:13.089 --> 05:16.058
Can't believe I care more
about your father than you do.

05:16.092 --> 05:18.094
(door closes)

05:23.966 --> 05:25.735
I've been thinking.
Now that Tom Petty's gone,

05:25.768 --> 05:29.405
that makes Bob Dylan the only
surviving Traveling Wilbury.

05:29.438 --> 05:31.708
You know,
it's amazing the conversations

05:31.741 --> 05:35.011
I'm willing to have
in this office for free scotch.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.846
-ED: Hi, Mikey.
-Hey.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.380
Mike, I saw Kristin
come out of your office

05:38.414 --> 05:41.117
looking a little agitated.
Is everything okay?

05:41.150 --> 05:44.086
I tell you, it was weird.
She just marched in my office

05:44.120 --> 05:48.057
and told me she cared more
about my dead dad than I did.

05:48.090 --> 05:49.759
So, were you angry with her

05:49.792 --> 05:51.961
or impressed
at how well she knows you?

05:53.062 --> 05:54.463
To be honest with you,
it bugs me.

05:54.496 --> 05:56.065
You know,
I'm glad she loves my dad,

05:56.098 --> 05:57.767
but it was easy for her.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.401
She didn't have to do
her homework

05:59.435 --> 06:03.305
locked in his car
outside of Jolly Jack's.

06:03.339 --> 06:05.708
Sad day when that gin mill
closed down.

06:05.742 --> 06:07.710
Jack, by the way, was not jolly.

06:07.744 --> 06:10.312
It was just one
of those ironic nicknames.

06:10.346 --> 06:12.048
My dad was good to her.

06:12.081 --> 06:14.416
He came to a lot of her games,
her recitals.

06:14.450 --> 06:17.086
(chuckles softly): You know
where he was on my graduation?

06:17.119 --> 06:18.587
Oh. Jolly Jack's.

06:18.621 --> 06:20.089
Yeah. It was Balloon Night.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.459
It's time my daughter found out

06:23.492 --> 06:25.427
the type of guy
her grandpa really was.

06:25.461 --> 06:27.329
-Oh, oh, oh. No.
-No, no, no.
That's a bad idea, buddy.

06:27.363 --> 06:29.398
-That's a bad idea.
-Do not go there, Baxter.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.801
Do not speak ill of the dead.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.636
Really? Coming from you?

06:33.670 --> 06:35.805
Didn't you tell me you saw
your dad at the funeral parlor,

06:35.838 --> 06:37.506
lying there
with a smile on his face,

06:37.539 --> 06:40.109
and you actually said,
"Who's this guy?"

06:40.142 --> 06:42.278
(chuckles): Yeah,
but I didn't say it to my son.

06:42.311 --> 06:44.747
I let him believe
his grandpa was a great guy

06:44.781 --> 06:46.649
who knew Muhammad Ali

06:46.683 --> 06:49.351
and may have dated
Obama's mother.

06:49.385 --> 06:52.855
I'd smile and say,
"Well, she did like black guys."

06:54.891 --> 06:56.425
Look,
Kristin only knows the myth.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.594
Think it's about time
she got to know the man.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.096
You just don't understand

07:00.129 --> 07:02.198
your father's generation,
my generation.

07:02.231 --> 07:04.600
We didn't set out
to make you kids miserable.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.269
Hell, we hardly thought
about you at all.

07:07.303 --> 07:08.771
Got that.

07:08.805 --> 07:11.173
To my dad,
I was just a pain in the ass.

07:11.207 --> 07:12.742
Not just to your dad.

07:14.010 --> 07:15.611
You modern fathers
changed the game.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.447
Now dads feel things, you know?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.149
You know, a-and they cry and...

07:20.182 --> 07:22.051
But don't-don't hold us
to the same standard.

07:22.084 --> 07:24.220
No. We were men.

07:25.855 --> 07:27.323
I just want her to know
the whole truth, you know?

07:27.356 --> 07:28.725
And it's not all bad. It's...

07:28.758 --> 07:31.160
(chuckles) It's fifty-fifty.

07:31.193 --> 07:33.863
Eh, sixty-forty.

07:33.896 --> 07:36.565
Seventy-thirty.

07:36.598 --> 07:39.401
If we're gonna be talking
about our dead dads in here,

07:39.435 --> 07:42.438
you are gonna have to start
buying better scotch.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.911
I think it says, "I'm in charge.

07:48.945 --> 07:51.080
I'll decide who works here."

07:57.887 --> 08:00.589
Do you love it?

08:00.622 --> 08:02.992
(sighs) Um...

08:03.025 --> 08:06.395
I don't love it.

08:06.428 --> 08:09.598
But that might be
because I don't like it.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.602
Okay, let's see.

08:18.574 --> 08:20.609
Uh, you didn't like
the one-piece.

08:20.642 --> 08:23.012
Ugh.

08:23.045 --> 08:25.247
You didn't like
the Nehru jacket.

08:25.281 --> 08:28.617
-Mm.
-Still may fight you on that.

08:28.650 --> 08:30.887
Uh, oh,
and-and what did we decide

08:30.920 --> 08:32.454
on the drop crotch pants?

08:34.490 --> 08:37.927
Well, the length of that zipper
is a little intimidating.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.898
H-Hey, what if I just wear

08:41.931 --> 08:44.133
my regular shirt
with this tie I have?

08:44.166 --> 08:46.769
It's shaped like a fish.

08:46.803 --> 08:49.438
No, I-I thought
you wanted me to help you

08:49.471 --> 08:51.240
feel more comfortable
around those people at work.

08:51.273 --> 08:52.608
I do, but...

08:55.644 --> 08:58.614
You know, I-I need to feel
more than just comfortable.

08:58.647 --> 09:00.749
I need to feel confident.

09:00.783 --> 09:05.154
No matter what I do,
I just feel like Kyle.

09:05.187 --> 09:06.388
Oh, honey.

09:06.422 --> 09:08.457
This is a process.

09:08.490 --> 09:10.426
We'll find something.

09:12.261 --> 09:14.230
Now, just to be clear,

09:14.263 --> 09:18.767
it's a tie,
but it looks like a fish.

09:18.801 --> 09:21.170
Oh, wait. Did you say a fish?

09:21.203 --> 09:23.605
-Yes!
-No.

09:27.343 --> 09:28.310
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:28.344 --> 09:29.745
-You're home early.
-Yeah.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.147
Hope I didn't make your
boyfriend jump in the bushes.

09:31.180 --> 09:34.516
(chuckles):
No, he's gone.

09:34.550 --> 09:37.453
Took my heart with him.

09:37.486 --> 09:39.421
Oh, Goodwill's coming tomorrow.
I'm gonna go inventory

09:39.455 --> 09:41.357
-those boxes.
-Oh, great.

09:41.390 --> 09:43.259
Um, Kristin's coming to dinner.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.794
Said she needs to talk to you.

09:45.828 --> 09:47.629
Well, great, 'cause I need
to talk to her, too.

09:47.663 --> 09:49.298
That's sweet,
you both need to talk.

09:49.331 --> 09:50.766
What's wrong?

09:50.799 --> 09:53.502
She gave me
all this stuff yesterday

09:53.535 --> 09:55.437
about her caring more
about my dad than me.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.039
I thought I raised my daughters

09:57.073 --> 10:00.042
to be annoyed by the same people
that I was annoyed by.

10:00.076 --> 10:03.645
Well, they all agree on Geraldo.

10:03.679 --> 10:07.116
So, what are you
going to say to her?

10:07.149 --> 10:08.784
I'm gonna tell her the truth
about Bud.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.119
He wasn't just
this fuzzy grandpa

10:10.152 --> 10:12.221
that gave her five bucks
on her birthday.

10:12.254 --> 10:14.190
Hmm, hmm. Actually,
it was 20 bucks.

10:14.223 --> 10:15.791
-What?
-Honey...

10:15.824 --> 10:18.494
-Okay, so he bought her love.
-Okay.

10:18.527 --> 10:20.129
Y-You know,
maybe this isn't the best time

10:20.162 --> 10:21.497
to talk to her about it,

10:21.530 --> 10:23.499
because you-you seem
pretty worked up.

10:23.532 --> 10:26.502
Okay, I-I'm at my best
when I'm pretty worked up.

10:26.535 --> 10:28.204
Look, you have barely spoken

10:28.237 --> 10:30.006
-about Bud in four months.
-Oh, come on, come on, come on.

10:30.039 --> 10:31.908
This could be the longest
conversation we've had about him

10:31.941 --> 10:33.475
since the night he died.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.077
Well, what's to say about him,
you know?

10:35.111 --> 10:36.378
He was a lousy father.

10:36.412 --> 10:38.547
He dropped dead
at a bowling alley.

10:38.580 --> 10:40.216
And?

10:40.249 --> 10:42.351
-And it was a tragedy.
-Yeah.

10:42.384 --> 10:44.720
'Cause he was on his way
to bowling 220.

10:46.022 --> 10:47.890
All right, look.

10:47.924 --> 10:49.491
You know, I-I'm just worried
because you haven't grieved.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.093
-I don't-- Honey. Honey.
-And-- But it's fine. It's fine.

10:51.127 --> 10:52.661
-I'm-I'm good with...
-Everybody grieves

10:52.694 --> 10:54.230
in their own time,
but maybe you should put off

10:54.263 --> 10:57.866
any dramatic revelations
until you have.

10:57.900 --> 11:01.370
Here's a dramatic revelation:
I'm good. I'm good.

11:01.403 --> 11:04.273
It's Kris that needs to know
the truth about my dad.

11:08.410 --> 11:09.878
This ought to be good.

11:09.912 --> 11:13.449
I can't wait to hear
the truth about me.

11:13.482 --> 11:15.484
(sighs)

11:24.927 --> 11:28.965
I forgot how comfortable
this chair was.

11:28.998 --> 11:31.700
All right, Michael, let's hear
all the awful things you have

11:31.733 --> 11:34.236
to say about your dear,
departed dad.

11:34.270 --> 11:37.806
I don't think we should get into
this, it's kind of a long list.

11:37.839 --> 11:42.644
Well, it's not like I have
any place to be.

11:42.678 --> 11:45.547
Come on, hotshot. Spill it.

11:45.581 --> 11:48.717
Dead and still cranky.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.587
Okay, you know, as a boy,

11:51.620 --> 11:53.889
I don't remember a lot of pats
on the back.

11:53.922 --> 11:57.159
It was, more literally,
kicks in the ass.

11:57.193 --> 11:59.962
That's because you were
kind of a knucklehead.

12:01.497 --> 12:03.499
But you became a big success.

12:03.532 --> 12:05.134
You're welcome.

12:05.167 --> 12:07.970
Whoa, nice try, Dad,
but I am who I am

12:08.004 --> 12:10.439
despite how you raised me,
not because of it.

12:10.472 --> 12:11.640
Next.

12:13.142 --> 12:15.111
You said it was a long list.

12:15.144 --> 12:16.678
You were distant.

12:16.712 --> 12:19.648
Holy crap, I sound horrible.

12:19.681 --> 12:22.084
Did I wear black socks
with shorts, too?

12:22.118 --> 12:23.652
At my wedding.

12:25.221 --> 12:27.689
You just weren't that involved
in my life, Dad.

12:27.723 --> 12:30.359
Well, I was kind of busy
living mine.

12:30.392 --> 12:33.195
I worked, came home tired
and went to bed.

12:33.229 --> 12:37.433
Repeat, repeat, repeat,
drop dead in a bowling alley.

12:37.466 --> 12:40.836
I work, too; I get tired, too;
I like to bowl, too.

12:40.869 --> 12:44.573
At least I used to, now it's
just a bit too creepy.

12:46.242 --> 12:48.477
But I made time for my kids.

12:48.510 --> 12:50.879
I am getting
the distinct feeling

12:50.912 --> 12:53.615
that you are trying to say
you're a better dad than me.

12:53.649 --> 12:56.452
That's because I'm saying it.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.620
Well, guess what?

12:58.654 --> 13:01.623
I said I was a better dad
than mine, too.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.792
I thought he was
a miserable bastard.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.795
You think I'm
a miserable bastard.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.231
Now Kristin thinks you're
a miserable bastard.

13:09.265 --> 13:12.201
That's being a dad.

13:12.234 --> 13:14.536
Maybe on a pirate ship.

13:16.238 --> 13:18.006
Kris is upset with me,

13:18.040 --> 13:20.842
but she loves me
and she knows I love her.

13:20.876 --> 13:22.511
That's being a dad.

13:22.544 --> 13:24.080
Ah.

13:24.113 --> 13:27.383
I think we're getting
to the real issue, kid.

13:27.416 --> 13:30.152
I tell my kids I love them
all the time.

13:30.186 --> 13:32.921
I don't think I ever remember
you saying that.

13:32.954 --> 13:35.824
(exhales)

13:35.857 --> 13:38.727
I feel the need to say something
to you right now.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.332
Really?

13:43.365 --> 13:45.401
Go ahead, say it.

13:45.434 --> 13:48.104
(sharp inhale) Boo-hoo!

13:49.805 --> 13:52.241
I didn't know that was part
of the job.

13:52.274 --> 13:54.009
I did the best I could.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.877
What a waste of time.

13:55.911 --> 13:57.346
Isn't there a bowling alley

13:57.379 --> 13:58.880
you should be haunting
right about now?

13:58.914 --> 14:00.349
Hey, wise guy.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.084
Did you ever think about this?

14:02.118 --> 14:05.921
I also don't remember
you ever saying you loved me.

14:15.997 --> 14:18.334
I was going to.

14:19.601 --> 14:21.770
Yeah, me, too.

14:21.803 --> 14:26.142
Funny how life doesn't wait
for us sometimes, huh?

14:40.522 --> 14:41.823
Yeah.

14:41.857 --> 14:43.625
Kyle, I've ju--

14:44.760 --> 14:47.163
Kyle, my boy, look at you,

14:47.196 --> 14:49.665
sitting there with your suit
and tie.

14:49.698 --> 14:52.368
You look like one of those
Mad Men.

14:54.303 --> 14:56.172
Well, thank you, sir.

14:56.205 --> 14:58.240
Mandy and I worked
on this together.

14:58.274 --> 15:00.742
Well, this is, this is a cause
for celebration.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.077
Come up to my office
for a drink.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.479
You've earned it. Come on, son.

15:03.512 --> 15:05.481
Uh, you know what? I still have
some work to do.

15:05.514 --> 15:08.317
Kyle, it's the end of the day,
son. It's all right, come on.

15:08.350 --> 15:10.419
Come on. (chuckles)

15:10.452 --> 15:13.689
Come on, come on, son.

15:19.295 --> 15:22.964
Blistering barnacles
in a hot pot of coffee.

15:22.998 --> 15:24.300
-Chuck, come in here, quick.
-What?

15:28.504 --> 15:30.839
Oh, hell no.

15:32.674 --> 15:34.109
(laughing)

15:34.142 --> 15:36.712
It's what they're wearing
in London right now.

15:36.745 --> 15:38.947
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.483
Just admiring Kyle's
new ensemble.

15:41.517 --> 15:42.951
-Yeah, isn't it fun?
-Mm-hmm.

15:42.984 --> 15:46.522
(laughing): It's the most fun
I've had all day.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.957
Excuse us.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.492
Hey, just ignore them.

15:50.526 --> 15:52.861
This is an outfit
that really says something.

15:52.894 --> 15:54.863
Yeah. It says,

15:54.896 --> 15:58.367
"This guy forgot his pants."

15:58.400 --> 16:00.902
Well, you know, in sort of
a clever twist,

16:00.936 --> 16:04.540
tomorrow you'll be in long pants
with a sleeveless jacket.

16:04.573 --> 16:06.007
No, Mandy. I've made up my mind.

16:06.041 --> 16:07.809
I want to wear
what I want to wear.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.812
Where did that come from?

16:10.846 --> 16:15.016
I don't know. I-I'm sorry.

16:15.050 --> 16:17.219
No, it was great.

16:17.253 --> 16:19.921
You were all bossy
and sure of yourself.

16:21.523 --> 16:24.760
Yeah, wow.
I guess I really was.

16:24.793 --> 16:26.495
That's confidence.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.096
And it looks great on you.

16:28.129 --> 16:29.865
Not as great
as the Nehru jacket,

16:29.898 --> 16:31.933
but that ship has sailed.

16:31.967 --> 16:33.869
Thank you, Mandy.

16:33.902 --> 16:35.837
This is what I've been missing.

16:35.871 --> 16:39.475
Wouldn't feel this way unless
you made me dress like a dork.

16:41.277 --> 16:43.679
Yeah, do me a favor and don't
say that in my Yelp review.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.382
You know, the new confident Kyle

16:46.415 --> 16:48.584
-is taking you out to dinner.
-(gasps)

16:48.617 --> 16:50.752
And if they try to leave onions
on my burger,

16:50.786 --> 16:52.888
oh, they're getting
a piece of my mind.

16:54.490 --> 16:56.191
Oh, babe,
I just had a great idea

16:56.224 --> 16:57.726
for what you can wear tomorrow.

16:57.759 --> 17:01.563
It's a tie,
but it looks like a fish.

17:01.597 --> 17:03.299
I think you have one of those.

17:03.332 --> 17:06.568
One? I have a whole school
of fish ties.

17:13.575 --> 17:14.543
-Dad?
-(screams)

17:14.576 --> 17:16.478
(yells indistinctly)

17:16.512 --> 17:18.280
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, man!

17:18.314 --> 17:20.449
-I didn't mean to scare you.
-You didn't scare me.

17:20.482 --> 17:22.784
I was working on this
and so it-- Whoa.

17:22.818 --> 17:24.653
Okay.

17:24.686 --> 17:27.323
Uh, but I'm glad you're here
'cause I think we need to talk.

17:27.356 --> 17:29.257
Oh, okay.
Uh, me first. Please?

17:29.291 --> 17:30.792
Okay.

17:30.826 --> 17:33.094
I had no right to say

17:33.128 --> 17:35.431
what I said to you yesterday
in your office.

17:35.464 --> 17:38.934
It was really thoughtless, Dad,
and I'm so sorry.

17:38.967 --> 17:41.570
Thanks. Kristin,
I appreciate that.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.839
What did you want to tell me?

17:43.872 --> 17:46.141
Okay. You had no right to say

17:46.174 --> 17:48.844
what you said to me
in the office the other day.

17:48.877 --> 17:51.947
-It was wrong and you should be
so, so sorry.
-(laughs)

17:51.980 --> 17:53.815
Well, I'm glad we took care
of that.

17:53.849 --> 17:56.452
Actually, what I want to say is,

17:56.485 --> 17:59.421
if you and Ryan think
you can run Bud's Buds...

17:59.455 --> 18:02.090
Oh, my gosh, yes.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.925
It's going to be a lot of work

18:03.959 --> 18:05.594
and a real pain in the ass,
honey.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.763
I know, I don't care.
Oh, thank you.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.498
I'm a... I'm available
for consultation.

18:09.531 --> 18:11.333
I'm not going to run this place.

18:11.367 --> 18:13.969
-Yes, this is so cool. Oh.
-Okay.

18:14.002 --> 18:16.638
It's like, it's like
Grandpa's still with us.

18:16.672 --> 18:20.041
Yeah, I know just what you mean.

18:22.344 --> 18:24.646
He was, uh...

18:24.680 --> 18:28.116
He was kind of special to you,
wasn't he?

18:28.149 --> 18:30.719
He was my hero.

18:30.752 --> 18:33.522
Huh.

18:33.555 --> 18:35.724
And yet, I remember pulling you
out of the river

18:35.757 --> 18:39.160
when you fell out of the canoe,
but he's your hero.

18:39.194 --> 18:42.364
So, huh.

18:42.398 --> 18:45.200
You're my all-time hero, Dad.

18:45.233 --> 18:47.235
Grandpa was my...

18:48.670 --> 18:50.539
Your what?

18:56.512 --> 18:59.047
(chuckles)

18:59.080 --> 19:01.216
I'm 17.

19:01.249 --> 19:04.152
In my backpack,
I've got a pregnancy test

19:04.185 --> 19:06.588
with a neon,
blinking plus sign on it

19:06.622 --> 19:08.490
the size of a manhole cover.

19:08.524 --> 19:10.992
(laughs) I'm thinking,
"I'm dead.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.761
My life is over."

19:12.794 --> 19:15.030
And I'm driving to get pizza
with Grandpa,

19:15.063 --> 19:18.233
and he pulls over
and he looks at me and says,

19:18.266 --> 19:20.869
"What the hell's
with you today?"

19:20.902 --> 19:25.340
All the tact of
a construction boot.

19:25.373 --> 19:28.176
And so I look at him...

19:28.209 --> 19:30.412
and I tell him.

19:30.446 --> 19:33.281
I tell him everything.

19:34.650 --> 19:36.885
My dad was the first person
you told?

19:36.918 --> 19:39.387
Yep.

19:39.421 --> 19:41.457
-And he didn't kill Ryan?
-(chuckles)

19:41.490 --> 19:44.626
He offered.

19:44.660 --> 19:47.596
Mostly we-we talked about how
scared I was to tell you.

19:47.629 --> 19:51.066
How I was afraid
you'd be ashamed of me.

19:52.968 --> 19:56.472
But he said, "Kristin,
I know your father,

19:56.505 --> 20:01.109
"and he will love you even more
than he loves you now.

20:01.142 --> 20:04.446
'Cause that's the kind
of dad he is."

20:06.482 --> 20:09.918
H-Huh. Hmm.

20:09.951 --> 20:13.455
-And he was right.
-Yeah.

20:13.489 --> 20:14.890
You know what?

20:14.923 --> 20:16.925
-I'm gonna fix this.
-Okay.

20:18.293 --> 20:21.630
I hate--
Don't want anybody hurt in here.

20:21.663 --> 20:23.665
I'll-I'll see you
at dinner, okay?

20:23.699 --> 20:25.967
Okay.

20:26.001 --> 20:28.604
Oof... Uh, Kris?

20:28.637 --> 20:30.338
Yeah.

20:30.371 --> 20:33.074
I love you.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.776
You know that.

20:34.810 --> 20:36.812
Always.

20:42.718 --> 20:44.720
(sighs)

20:53.394 --> 20:55.463
Look at that.

20:55.497 --> 20:58.934
Finally getting my garage back,
and baby, you look great.

20:58.967 --> 21:02.003
(chuckles) I'd say get a room,
but your girlfriend is a room.

21:02.037 --> 21:03.639
Mmm, mmm, mmm-- Oh, no.

21:03.672 --> 21:05.607
The bust of Ronald Reagan,
that stays.

21:05.641 --> 21:08.009
In the garage.
It stays in the garage.

21:09.210 --> 21:11.379
-The chair going?
-No. It stays.

21:11.412 --> 21:13.682
In the living room.
In the living room.

21:16.918 --> 21:18.887
I'm glad, honey.
I'm really glad.

21:20.589 --> 21:24.192
This is the most uncomfortable
chair I've ever sat on.

21:24.225 --> 21:27.362
Now I know why my dad
was so grumpy all the time.

21:27.395 --> 21:30.999
You guys need any hel--
Oh, my God.

21:31.032 --> 21:32.400
(chuckles)
You look just like Grandpa.

21:32.433 --> 21:37.005
Oh, boy! Take the chair!
Hey! Take the chair!

21:38.540 --> 21:40.008
(chicken clucking)

21:40.041 --> 21:42.010
