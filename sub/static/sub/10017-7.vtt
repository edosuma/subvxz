00:13.386 --> 00:14.875
Coming through.

00:18.391 --> 00:19.823
Thank you.

00:20.426 --> 00:22.256
God, what a day.

00:22.460 --> 00:23.655
ER.

00:24.095 --> 00:26.222
Yes, I know they're late,
but I can't...

00:26.531 --> 00:29.500
Okay, I'm on my way.
They're on their way up.

00:55.824 --> 00:59.658
No, this isn't ER.
This is Patrick.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.464
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.768
Are you the new desk clerk?

01:14.909 --> 01:16.398
Yeah. Right.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.744
- Who are you?
- Patrick.

01:18.946 --> 01:21.005
Okay, Patrick, where is everybody?

01:23.216 --> 01:26.674
My dad went to the bathroom.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.720
You go sit over here.
You can't sit here.

01:33.959 --> 01:35.085
Don't turn.

01:39.331 --> 01:40.525
Hi, this is John Carter.

01:40.733 --> 01:43.166
I'm calling about your ad
for the apartment.

01:43.368 --> 01:44.768
Got anything to eat?

01:46.137 --> 01:47.126
I'm sorry?

01:47.338 --> 01:49.805
- Perfect. I'm starved.
- It's been taken.

01:50.008 --> 01:51.339
Mr. Carter?

01:51.542 --> 01:53.567
This is great.
Where'd these come from?

01:53.777 --> 01:57.144
Taglieri. He brought them in
for Carol Hathaway, I think.

02:02.886 --> 02:05.252
There's a woman who needs
stitches in her face.

02:05.455 --> 02:08.685
The plastic surgery boys are there.
Go in and back cleanup.

02:08.890 --> 02:11.655
Give her a really good scar.
Just kidding.

02:11.861 --> 02:15.024
EMT's at the back door with
a 20-year-old stabbing victim.

02:15.231 --> 02:18.223
- It doesn't sound good.
- All right. Notify the O.R.

02:18.433 --> 02:20.833
Tell the blood bank
I need eight units O-neg.

02:21.036 --> 02:22.526
You still doing
the total gastrectomy?

02:22.737 --> 02:24.728
I have an interview
with Morgenstern and Bradley.

02:24.939 --> 02:26.770
- Starzl Fellowship?
- Yep.

02:26.941 --> 02:27.930
- What?
- Nothing.

02:28.143 --> 02:29.974
Langworthy said only
third-year residents get it?

02:30.178 --> 02:31.337
- Exactly.
- In her dreams.

02:31.545 --> 02:33.479
Tell Morgenstern to meet me
at Trauma 2.

02:33.681 --> 02:35.672
- What do we got?
- Stab wounds to the neck.

02:35.883 --> 02:39.114
- Pulse is 150 and thready, BP's 50 palp.
- What else?

02:39.319 --> 02:43.585
Couldn't tube him, too much blood.
This guy's circling the drain.

02:43.790 --> 02:46.055
I love that about you.
You're all optimism.

02:46.259 --> 02:49.159
All right, let's take the turn.
Get him in Trauma 2.

02:49.362 --> 02:53.195
Move it. Let's not lose him, all right?
Here we go. Follow me.

03:00.439 --> 03:02.270
All right, unstrap him.

03:04.975 --> 03:07.239
We're gonna do this
like we always do.

03:08.846 --> 03:12.680
We're gonna do it on my count.
One, two, three.

03:13.184 --> 03:15.311
Let's go to work.
Pulse ox?

03:15.752 --> 03:17.913
It's only 70, and he's cyanotic.

03:18.121 --> 03:20.146
All right, let's go.
Here we go.

03:23.193 --> 03:25.717
No airway. Intubation tray.
Move!

03:26.396 --> 03:28.489
- Seven and a half?
- Yes.

03:35.237 --> 03:36.864
Come on. Come on.

03:37.306 --> 03:39.773
I can't see anything in here.
Suction!

03:40.042 --> 03:42.976
Come on. I need some suction.
Let's get it in here.

03:43.178 --> 03:45.577
All right, we got a
full out gusher here.

03:45.780 --> 03:48.977
One more minute, he'll have
brain damage. Let's do a crike.

03:49.183 --> 03:51.117
- You sure?
- As the day is long. Let's move.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.980
Doing a surgical airway here.

03:53.187 --> 03:56.314
Give me the numbers.
Count it out nice and loud.

03:56.523 --> 04:00.118
BP still 60 over 40, pulse 160.

04:00.326 --> 04:01.658
All right. Trach tube.

04:01.862 --> 04:02.988
Thank you, doctor.

04:03.997 --> 04:06.226
Syringe. Come on.

04:15.039 --> 04:17.132
Let's see what we got here.

04:23.782 --> 04:25.146
I like the way it sounds.

04:25.350 --> 04:28.808
All right, I believe we
have ourselves a breather here.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.419
Welcome back, sir.
Can you ventilate him?

04:31.622 --> 04:33.852
- Good morning, Peter.
- Breathing easy.

04:34.057 --> 04:35.251
What've you got?

04:35.526 --> 04:37.391
A stab wound to the neck.

04:37.594 --> 04:41.462
Unable to intubate due to bleeding.
I performed a stat cricothyrotomy.

04:41.665 --> 04:45.600
Airway established. Good bilateral
breath sounds. The patient is stable.

04:45.802 --> 04:48.702
What do you need me for?
Let's get him up to the O.R.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.539
Excellent.

04:53.742 --> 04:57.178
Excellent work.
Sound judgment. A solid execution.

04:57.379 --> 04:58.437
Excellent.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.843
I'll see you at the Starzl interview
this afternoon.

05:02.050 --> 05:03.347
Right.

05:05.420 --> 05:06.750
Pretty cool.

06:01.904 --> 06:02.893
ER.

06:03.540 --> 06:04.836
Yeah, hold on.

06:05.675 --> 06:08.006
Carter, phone for you.

06:08.878 --> 06:09.936
For me?

06:15.417 --> 06:16.577
Thanks, Jerry.

06:18.286 --> 06:21.187
Yes, I did call about the one bedroom.

06:23.024 --> 06:25.492
No. What about the studio?

06:26.227 --> 06:27.693
Garage?

06:27.928 --> 06:30.795
No, I don't think I want a gara...
Hello?

06:34.101 --> 06:35.864
- That's good.
- Looking for an apartment?

06:36.069 --> 06:40.334
Yeah. I've been living at home,
and my dad thinks I'm a freeloader.

06:40.540 --> 06:43.532
Mine did too.
I found my own place six months ago.

06:43.743 --> 06:46.735
- Through the paper?
- No, through a patient.

06:46.946 --> 06:49.505
Eighty-five-year-old guy
has a heart attack.

06:49.715 --> 06:51.705
He crumped, I jumped.

06:51.918 --> 06:54.909
- Are you saying that he died and...
- Dr. Benton?

06:55.620 --> 06:59.180
Dr. Morgenstern called. He wanted me
to tell you that your...

06:59.356 --> 07:01.381
...Stertzle?
- Starzl.

07:01.793 --> 07:04.192
The interview's been pushed to 3:00.

07:05.296 --> 07:06.888
Oh, man.

07:07.298 --> 07:09.266
A boy with a laceration in 1.

07:09.633 --> 07:12.032
Carter's having a light day.
Let him take it.

07:12.836 --> 07:14.234
I'd rather you do it.

07:21.210 --> 07:23.770
Carter, see the kid in 1.

07:23.979 --> 07:26.345
I gotta go to Recovery
to see a patient.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.685
A 96-year-old stroke victim
in Curtain Area 3.

07:30.886 --> 07:33.116
- You might want to check it out.
- Check it out?

07:33.422 --> 07:36.619
Yeah. He lives at
1680 North Lakeshore Drive.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.655
Great location.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.191
More sleep.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.029
More sleep.

07:48.369 --> 07:49.699
Say it ain't so, Joe.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.734
It ain't so, Joe.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.565
Oh, God. It's 7:00.

07:53.773 --> 07:56.640
My shift starts in a half an hour.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.904
You're gonna be late.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.510
I am?

08:02.148 --> 08:04.615
I called the hospital
and told them...

08:04.817 --> 08:07.615
...you're too busy
having sex with your wife.

08:09.121 --> 08:11.954
And you want me to make
an honest woman out of you?

08:17.195 --> 08:19.686
Okay, that takes care of the cut.

08:19.897 --> 08:21.660
I fell off a ladder.

08:21.866 --> 08:23.094
Yeah, I know.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.200
Let's check your elbow.

08:25.636 --> 08:27.661
I fell off a stool...

08:27.872 --> 08:31.204
...but I didn't hurt my head.

08:31.408 --> 08:33.467
It stays on, see?

08:33.977 --> 08:35.307
Go like this.

08:38.615 --> 08:40.639
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

08:41.049 --> 08:43.143
- Patrick.
- Patrick who?

08:44.754 --> 08:46.483
Me, Patrick.

08:47.956 --> 08:51.620
Okay. I think it's probably fine,
but just to be sure...

08:51.826 --> 08:53.691
...l'll have someone
take an x-ray.

08:54.396 --> 08:55.420
X-ray?

08:56.531 --> 08:59.090
It's like a picture of your bones.

09:01.835 --> 09:03.029
Can I keep it?

09:03.237 --> 09:04.431
Sure.

09:05.339 --> 09:07.136
Thank you.

09:09.742 --> 09:11.301
You're welcome, Patrick.

09:13.147 --> 09:15.808
I'll be back to check on you, okay?

09:16.015 --> 09:17.744
Take him up to X-ray.

09:19.986 --> 09:21.010
Sweet kid.

09:21.220 --> 09:24.916
I think I should be going out
with patients instead of doctors.

09:25.124 --> 09:28.287
Doctors? I don't know.
Shrinks aren't too bad.

09:28.493 --> 09:30.552
- So the rumors are true.
- What rumors?

09:30.762 --> 09:32.662
That you've been dating Div Cvetic.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.660
Oh, just now and then.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.765
- For two months.
- Oh, jeez.

09:36.968 --> 09:39.367
Was it a secret?
You eat with him every day.

09:39.570 --> 09:42.539
Malik, did you get blood samples
from the lady in 5?

09:42.740 --> 09:45.299
- Already at the lab.
- Great. Thanks.

09:46.209 --> 09:47.335
So everyone knows?

09:47.544 --> 09:51.844
He's taking you to a birthday dinner
and asked you to wear that black dress.

09:52.082 --> 09:54.550
Oh, my God! Did he put it
in the newsletter?

09:54.751 --> 09:56.183
The bulletin board.

09:57.286 --> 09:58.720
Just kidding.

09:59.656 --> 10:00.680
I will...

10:00.890 --> 10:02.356
...kill him...

10:03.225 --> 10:04.852
...after dinner.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.850
Jerry, you got anything to eat?

10:07.062 --> 10:09.029
Bagels in the lounge.

10:09.431 --> 10:12.024
Never mind.
Did Linda Farrell come by yet?

10:12.501 --> 10:16.334
Linda Farrell of the pizza,
Armani suit, Novell Pharmaceuticals?

10:16.537 --> 10:19.335
- Yes, Jerry.
- Haven't seen her.

10:25.245 --> 10:27.110
I'm a little confused.

10:27.314 --> 10:30.112
Is Slice your first name
or your middle name?

10:31.084 --> 10:32.641
Slice is his street name.

10:32.852 --> 10:34.081
Right.

10:34.287 --> 10:37.847
Street name.
And how did this happen?

10:38.057 --> 10:39.581
Cops beat me up.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.625
He put his foot through a window
breaking and entering.

10:42.828 --> 10:45.262
Who's the nurse
on the phone out there?

10:45.463 --> 10:48.160
That's Nurse Wright. Lydia Wright.

10:48.367 --> 10:49.765
She married?

10:49.968 --> 10:51.560
I have no idea.

10:52.270 --> 10:54.795
This is probably gonna sting
a little bit.

10:55.073 --> 10:56.097
What's that?

10:56.306 --> 11:00.800
That's an EKG caliper. We use it
to measure distances on a cardiogram.

11:02.312 --> 11:06.304
A cardiogram measures
the electrical activity of the heart.

11:06.517 --> 11:08.985
You probably shouldn't be doing that.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.495
Grab Lydia and Jerry,
and meet me at the ambulance bay.

11:20.663 --> 11:21.652
You bet.

11:36.611 --> 11:39.579
Radial head looks okay.
No fat-pad sign.

11:39.781 --> 11:41.111
I think he's in the clear.

11:41.315 --> 11:44.216
EMT's pulling in right now.
Motorcycle versus semi.

11:44.418 --> 11:46.715
- Who's on?
- Benton and Ross.

11:53.326 --> 11:55.191
Surprise!

11:55.794 --> 11:59.356
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

11:59.565 --> 12:02.693
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12:03.535 --> 12:08.404
<i>Happy birthday, dear Susan</i>

12:09.507 --> 12:14.035
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12:16.379 --> 12:18.871
Birthday Jell-O in the lounge.

12:19.817 --> 12:22.478
- I hate this.
- That's why we did it. That's for you.

12:22.686 --> 12:24.950
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

12:25.156 --> 12:26.554
Hey, Carol.

12:30.994 --> 12:33.827
I thought we'd crawl in here
and escape for an hour.

12:34.030 --> 12:37.863
You did? What if they find us in
a compromising position? Then what?

12:38.068 --> 12:40.433
Then how about a more exotic locale?

12:41.770 --> 12:43.293
I have seven minutes.

12:43.505 --> 12:44.529
Come on.

12:47.375 --> 12:50.708
I don't know if "exotic" is the word
I would've picked.

12:52.113 --> 12:53.102
Well, I mean...

12:53.314 --> 12:57.943
We'll put the pool in over there,
maybe a little wet bar, a putting green.

12:58.151 --> 13:00.847
- A putting green?
- Hey, I'm a doctor.

13:01.054 --> 13:04.114
Golf's easy. I could teach you
how to play this afternoon.

13:04.324 --> 13:05.813
I have four minutes.

13:06.193 --> 13:08.457
Maybe there's not
enough time for that.

13:09.463 --> 13:11.930
If you moved in,
there'd be more than enough time.

13:12.131 --> 13:14.395
You mentioned something
about that, right?

13:14.600 --> 13:16.500
Yeah, two weeks ago.

13:17.136 --> 13:19.536
The silence of no answer
is getting deafening.

13:19.905 --> 13:21.930
Oh, God, Tag.

13:22.173 --> 13:24.438
So much has happened, you know?

13:24.843 --> 13:26.504
And we've gotten through that.

13:27.279 --> 13:30.339
I just...
I want to move slowly and feel sure.

13:30.547 --> 13:31.775
About us?

13:32.650 --> 13:34.209
About me.

13:34.985 --> 13:38.250
I think we have moved slowly,
and I am sure about it all.

13:39.823 --> 13:41.848
Look, I'm a good guy, Carol.

13:42.059 --> 13:43.685
And I love you.

13:44.761 --> 13:48.424
If you have a problem with us,
I need you to deal with it.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.447
Knock, knock.

14:13.654 --> 14:14.882
Was that Patrick?

14:15.089 --> 14:17.751
Yeah. As a precaution,
Dr. Lewis has asked him...

14:17.958 --> 14:20.826
...to sit in a wheelchair
until his father gets here.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.793
Some precaution.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.991
Linda Farrell.
Still haven't seen her.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.828
Jerry, do you like your job?

14:31.036 --> 14:34.700
However, when I do, I'll track you down
no matter where you are.

14:34.907 --> 14:38.206
Well, and a good late morning to you.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.544
I had car trouble.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.908
I did. I had car trouble.

14:44.115 --> 14:45.549
How is Jennifer, Mark?

14:46.317 --> 14:47.444
She's great.

14:47.652 --> 14:50.416
Yeah, I'll bet. What's this for?
Later on tonight?

14:52.556 --> 14:53.853
Keep it up.

14:56.994 --> 14:59.462
She's adorable.

14:59.930 --> 15:01.955
She's almost 13 now.

15:02.332 --> 15:04.926
And this is Ralph.

15:05.135 --> 15:07.262
Have you ever seen anything so cute?

15:07.470 --> 15:09.404
Miniature schnauzers.

15:09.805 --> 15:11.102
Very cute.

15:12.842 --> 15:14.070
Is Mookie down there?

15:14.275 --> 15:15.641
Carter's stitching him up.

15:15.845 --> 15:17.471
Carter? Where's Benton?

15:17.680 --> 15:18.772
Don't know.

15:19.748 --> 15:22.581
That is one sorry paint job.

15:24.652 --> 15:27.985
The hospital saves the big bucks
for the doctors' salaries.

15:29.557 --> 15:32.457
I'm not even talking about myself.
I'm not a resident...

15:32.659 --> 15:34.855
...so they don't pay me anything.

15:35.429 --> 15:37.329
You're telling me you're a freebie?

15:40.701 --> 15:43.693
Where's Dr. Benton?
He's supposed to be stitching him up.

15:43.904 --> 15:45.838
Pawned me off on a freebie?

15:46.039 --> 15:49.998
Not one word out of you, Mookie James.
You've done enough for one day.

15:50.209 --> 15:52.005
- How do you two...
- Where is Benton?

15:52.211 --> 15:54.338
He had to go up to Recovery.

15:55.581 --> 15:57.640
Son of a bitch!

15:58.984 --> 16:01.817
You casually mentioned our dinner?

16:02.020 --> 16:03.248
To Doug Ross?

16:03.455 --> 16:06.048
Yeah. What's the problem?

16:06.258 --> 16:09.351
He's like Dr. Intercom.

16:09.561 --> 16:11.858
Biggest gossip in the hospital.

16:12.063 --> 16:14.793
The cafeteria workers probably know.

16:15.099 --> 16:18.556
But you do look great
in that black dress.

16:20.136 --> 16:21.865
This isn't working.

16:22.539 --> 16:23.563
Dr. Cvetic?

16:23.773 --> 16:25.707
- What?
- The patient I mentioned is over here...

16:25.909 --> 16:27.240
Three times you mentioned him.

16:27.443 --> 16:30.378
Three times I told you
I didn't have time to see him.

16:31.713 --> 16:32.805
What was your name?

16:33.015 --> 16:35.381
Div.
Malik, why don't I just take...

16:35.584 --> 16:37.312
Malik! That's right.

16:37.519 --> 16:40.385
And I told you that
three times too, Div.

16:40.823 --> 16:43.723
- Listen, son. You better...
- Okay, enough. Stop.

16:43.992 --> 16:47.017
- What will you do now? Arm wrestle?
- No, of course not.

16:47.228 --> 16:51.129
Look, I've had five admissions today.

16:51.331 --> 16:54.562
Two attempted suicides, two bipolars
who forgot to take lithium...

16:54.769 --> 16:58.727
...and a 40-year-old from the street
claiming to be dead, all before lunch.

17:00.740 --> 17:03.709
Your patient will have to
wait for the afternoon shift.

17:14.953 --> 17:17.147
Boat collision.
12-year-old in the wreck.

17:17.356 --> 17:19.550
- How long?
- EMT's pulling up now.

17:19.758 --> 17:23.021
Connie, clear Trauma 1,
notify the O.R. Now, please.

17:23.228 --> 17:24.888
His parents are with him.

17:25.463 --> 17:28.432
- Are they hurt?
- Thrown free, but they came with him.

17:28.633 --> 17:29.929
Give me O.R.

17:30.134 --> 17:33.865
- Oscar, what do you got?
- David Adler, 12, found unconscious.

17:34.071 --> 17:36.835
- Please help him.
- Mr. And Mrs. Adler, I'm Dr. Ross.

17:37.040 --> 17:41.170
- We're taking your son to Trauma.
- He went under. We couldn't find him.

17:41.378 --> 17:42.969
BP 70, pulse 140.

17:43.179 --> 17:44.840
Jerry will tell you where to wait.

17:45.047 --> 17:47.845
- Can we stay with him?
- We'll do everything we can.

17:48.050 --> 17:50.348
- Couldn't start an IV or intubate.
- Come with me.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.389
Okay. All right, here we go.
Get that.

17:56.591 --> 18:00.789
On three. Hit that buckle.
On three. One, two, three.

18:02.931 --> 18:04.091
All right.

18:07.568 --> 18:09.661
- Pass me the lidocaine.
- Airway.

18:10.905 --> 18:12.463
- Here you are.
- You got it.

18:17.745 --> 18:20.043
- All right, give me a...
- Six and a half.

18:23.650 --> 18:26.174
All right. Come on.

18:39.931 --> 18:42.923
Heart rate's low. Let's give him
atropine and epinephrine.

18:43.134 --> 18:45.125
- O-negative's here.
- You ordered it?

18:46.971 --> 18:47.960
Internal jugular?

18:48.506 --> 18:50.565
Have to.
His peripheral vein's collapsed.

18:50.740 --> 18:51.729
Here we go.

19:02.252 --> 19:04.651
Connie, will you move them
out of the hall?

19:10.125 --> 19:11.149
Perfect.

19:30.078 --> 19:31.669
Okay, here we go.

19:37.283 --> 19:38.774
Here it comes.

19:43.656 --> 19:45.056
I think we got this baby.

19:45.258 --> 19:46.987
O.R.'s prepped.
Benton will take him.

19:47.192 --> 19:50.594
- They can x-ray his C-spine upstairs.
- Let's take him on up.

19:52.798 --> 19:55.231
- Paddles!
- Two hundred?

19:57.302 --> 19:58.667
And clear.

20:00.538 --> 20:02.164
- Again.
- Three hundred?

20:02.507 --> 20:03.633
Clear.

20:04.743 --> 20:06.835
- Give me 360.
- Charging.

20:07.044 --> 20:08.375
And clear.

20:21.324 --> 20:23.884
Okay, he's stabilized.
Let's go!

20:31.066 --> 20:33.899
- Let's go! Come on.
- You'll need at least six units.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.831
All right, we got him. Let's go.

20:39.507 --> 20:41.805
- We just pulled that one out.
- Yes, we did.

20:42.009 --> 20:44.500
- That was like clockwork.
- I wish they all were.

20:44.712 --> 20:46.646
We haven't done a save like that
in a while.

20:46.847 --> 20:47.939
So smooth!

20:48.149 --> 20:51.447
You were great.
You anticipated every move, every beat.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.642
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yes, I mean it.

20:53.853 --> 20:57.118
I do. Yeah. I do.

21:00.392 --> 21:01.621
I do.

21:20.712 --> 21:23.180
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

21:26.551 --> 21:28.211
You didn't do it alone.

21:43.232 --> 21:45.200
Listen, I gotta go.

21:49.838 --> 21:52.068
All right, Patrick.
You'll be all right.

21:55.377 --> 21:56.503
Going home, Patrick?

21:58.046 --> 21:59.274
His father's here.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.643
And you're going to take it easy
for the next few days.

22:04.319 --> 22:07.310
Pick a card, any card.

22:13.559 --> 22:15.925
Oh, pick a card, any card.

22:16.096 --> 22:17.084
Here.

22:17.663 --> 22:19.790
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:19.999 --> 22:21.830
Let's find your dad.

22:22.168 --> 22:23.760
Let's go, Patrick.

22:24.137 --> 22:25.603
- All right.
- Going home.

22:26.839 --> 22:28.203
Going home?

22:28.407 --> 22:29.704
Where am I going?

22:29.975 --> 22:32.239
Can I come back and visit?

22:47.023 --> 22:51.426
Doug, I got a three-year-old with
a fever in 2, a six-month-old in 4.

22:51.629 --> 22:54.461
His mother says he's not
keeping anything down.

22:54.697 --> 22:56.494
Okay, I'll be right there.

22:56.832 --> 22:58.925
I'm sorry,
I still haven't seen her.

22:59.134 --> 23:01.695
- Seen who?
- Linda Farrell.

23:02.805 --> 23:05.330
Oh, right, Jerry.
Okay, thank you.

23:14.115 --> 23:18.108
Michael Carson, age 35, victim of
a five-mile-an-hour car accident.

23:18.319 --> 23:20.412
Not a scratch.
No clue why he's comatose.

23:20.620 --> 23:21.609
Results of the CT?

23:21.823 --> 23:24.985
Normal. No improvement
with glucose and narcan.

23:25.926 --> 23:28.224
Well, he's non-surgical.

23:28.762 --> 23:33.165
- He's all yours.
- The differential diagnosis of coma, huh?

23:33.399 --> 23:36.233
- Good luck.
- You too, on your interview.

23:40.606 --> 23:43.837
Well, let's see what
we can come up with.

23:46.745 --> 23:49.178
I asked you to take that boy
with the laceration.

23:49.380 --> 23:51.712
- Haleh, what are you doing here?
- Why didn't you?

23:51.916 --> 23:53.781
Carter could handle it.
What's the problem?

23:53.985 --> 23:56.545
The problem is
I asked you to treat him...

23:56.754 --> 23:58.847
...and hoped maybe you'd talk to him.

23:59.057 --> 24:02.184
- I had a patient to see in Recovery.
- The hell you did.

24:02.392 --> 24:04.690
You just didn't want to be involved.

24:04.929 --> 24:06.953
Okay. Whoa, wait a minute.

24:07.664 --> 24:09.859
Am I supposed to be
the Big Brothers program?

24:10.066 --> 24:13.900
I'm supposed to turn every gang kid
in here into Nelson Mandela?

24:14.103 --> 24:16.162
I know you'd never do that, Peter.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.397
That's why I never asked you before.

24:19.809 --> 24:22.902
I've known Mookie
since he was four years old...

24:23.111 --> 24:26.012
...and he was a sweet kid.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.375
And maybe someone
will get through to him...

24:28.583 --> 24:31.108
...and he will be that again someday.

24:31.685 --> 24:35.452
Probably wouldn't be half as tough
as getting through to you.

24:42.329 --> 24:46.425
What about metabolic causes?
Hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis?

24:46.633 --> 24:50.535
Blood tests rule that out. We know
it can't be arrhythmia or an MI.

24:50.737 --> 24:53.797
Negative CT rules out mass lesion
and trauma. Benton gave him narcan?

24:54.007 --> 24:55.338
And an amp of D-50.

24:55.541 --> 24:58.033
The blood was normal except
for the elevated white count.

24:58.244 --> 24:59.904
Up to 14,500.

25:00.113 --> 25:04.048
Pulse is slowing. It's down to 50.
And his BP's dropping.

25:04.250 --> 25:08.982
Well, speed up the IVs and give him
300cc bolus of saline.

25:09.187 --> 25:10.653
What about atropine?

25:10.856 --> 25:13.790
Yeah. Point 5 IV push.

25:14.159 --> 25:16.592
Maybe he had a seizure.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.061
Connie, get a temperature.

25:21.966 --> 25:25.696
He's got a slight abrasion on
his tongue, probably from biting it.

25:26.736 --> 25:28.499
Partially compensated
metabolic acidosis.

25:28.705 --> 25:30.138
You see that with seizures.

25:30.473 --> 25:32.338
101.5.

25:32.975 --> 25:34.443
Meningitis?

25:35.144 --> 25:36.703
Yeah, could be.

25:36.912 --> 25:39.574
We'll have to do a lumbar puncture.
You ever done one?

25:39.782 --> 25:42.182
No, no. But I've seen it done.

25:42.384 --> 25:44.375
See one, do one, teach one.

26:07.341 --> 26:09.241
- Benton.
- Hey, Sarah.

26:09.443 --> 26:10.909
You changed clothes.

26:13.045 --> 26:14.171
Yeah.

26:15.982 --> 26:18.041
- Who's in there now?
- Dalton.

26:18.250 --> 26:19.740
George Dalton?

26:20.152 --> 26:23.484
The guy can't close a door,
much less an incision.

26:23.722 --> 26:25.053
Yeah, who are you telling?

26:25.257 --> 26:28.487
I once saw him try to connect
a ureter to a sigmoid colon.

26:28.693 --> 26:29.717
You think that's bad?

26:29.928 --> 26:34.330
I watched him do a beautiful right
fem-pop bypass on a femoral artery.

26:34.531 --> 26:36.965
The left femoral artery.

26:38.569 --> 26:40.195
What'd he say to the patient?

26:40.404 --> 26:43.635
"There's some good news and, well,
there's some bad news."

26:43.841 --> 26:46.708
"Well, sir, the operation
was a success."

26:46.910 --> 26:49.309
"But it was the wrong leg."

26:56.118 --> 26:58.518
That was terrific.
Thank you, Dr. Dalton.

26:59.154 --> 27:01.281
It was good. It really was.
Thanks a lot.

27:01.490 --> 27:05.187
Dr. Benton, you don't mind if we take
Dr. Langworthy first, do you?

27:05.394 --> 27:07.918
She's scrubbing on
a small bowel at 4:30.

27:08.129 --> 27:09.960
Oh, no. Not at all.

27:10.164 --> 27:12.132
- Sarah, you ready?
- Yeah, sure.

27:12.333 --> 27:13.630
Come on in.

27:15.069 --> 27:18.664
Insert it between L-4 and L-5.

27:23.577 --> 27:27.137
Tilt it slightly upwards
so it's parallel with the bed.

27:29.615 --> 27:33.313
Advance it slowly between
the vertebrae...

27:33.520 --> 27:35.510
...then you'll feel a slight pop...

27:35.721 --> 27:39.122
...when the tip punctures
the spinal canal.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.889
- I felt it.
- Okay, you're not done yet.

27:46.131 --> 27:48.997
Now remove the stylet
from the needle...

27:49.200 --> 27:51.031
...and check for fluid.

27:56.774 --> 27:59.140
Perfect. Bingo.

27:59.443 --> 28:01.604
Perfect on the first shot.

28:02.579 --> 28:04.376
Crystal clear, Mr. Carter.

28:04.581 --> 28:06.481
That's one hell of a champagne tap.

28:06.683 --> 28:08.014
Champagne tap?

28:08.217 --> 28:11.152
Perfect hit the first time,
resident owes you a bottle.

28:11.353 --> 28:14.083
No, no, not the resident, the nurse.

28:14.356 --> 28:17.689
Dr. Greene, your wife asked if
you could meet her at Doc's.

28:17.893 --> 28:19.485
Okay. Thanks, Jerry.

28:45.017 --> 28:46.780
Couldn't wait till tonight?

28:46.986 --> 28:48.214
I wish.

28:50.223 --> 28:53.658
Judge Franklin called.
He said my zoning opinion...

28:53.859 --> 28:57.761
...wasn't what he'd hoped for
from a University of Chicago graduate.

28:57.963 --> 29:00.329
- The guy's nuts.
- He's an appellate judge.

29:00.599 --> 29:04.865
So what? It's the first thing
you've written. What do you expect?

29:05.070 --> 29:06.298
Something better...

29:06.504 --> 29:09.701
...which he'll personally lead me in
at tonight's meeting.

29:14.278 --> 29:18.009
I called my mom. She's going to
bring Rachel up in the morning.

29:18.414 --> 29:20.575
I'll have to use the car again.

29:21.118 --> 29:23.483
It's all right. I'll take the EI.

29:27.624 --> 29:29.683
Jen, you'll do fine.

29:30.359 --> 29:31.519
How do you know?

29:31.728 --> 29:34.389
This is a "make it or break it" job.

29:34.596 --> 29:36.689
I mean, if I blow this chance...

29:41.737 --> 29:43.534
I wanted to spend the night with you.

29:45.373 --> 29:46.932
Well, you'll be back Monday.

29:48.342 --> 29:51.003
Rachel's daycare's
having a Halloween party Monday.

29:54.682 --> 29:57.275
- What about Tuesday?
- I work Tuesday.

29:58.819 --> 30:00.377
Well, maybe you can get off.

30:10.396 --> 30:14.264
We'll figure this all out.
It's just gonna take a little time.

30:16.202 --> 30:18.329
I'll call you when I get up there.

30:43.060 --> 30:45.187
I'll see you tomorrow
on that hemicolectomy.

30:45.394 --> 30:49.023
You bet. Dr. Benton, thank you
so much for waiting. You ready?

30:49.231 --> 30:50.357
Good.

30:52.367 --> 30:56.770
This is Dr. Bradley. He's in charge of
the Starzl Fellowship this year.

30:56.973 --> 31:00.203
Yes. Please be seated, Dr. Benton.
Pleasure.

31:00.408 --> 31:01.568
Thank you.

31:04.144 --> 31:08.342
It isn't often we entertain the
candidacy of a second-year resident.

31:08.817 --> 31:11.683
Yes, I know.
I feel very appreciative...

31:11.886 --> 31:14.821
...that you feel my qualifications
are worthy of consideration.

31:15.021 --> 31:16.455
Excellent recommendations.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.886
Obviously solid achievement.

31:19.259 --> 31:23.161
As you know, the Starzl Fellowship
allows you to study...

31:23.363 --> 31:26.457
...with transplant teams.
Have you researched that area?

31:26.666 --> 31:29.998
Well, not directly,
but I've done some...

31:30.235 --> 31:32.795
Any extracurricular activities?

31:33.005 --> 31:34.495
Yes.

31:35.073 --> 31:37.473
I believe it says... Excuse me...
Right there.

31:38.443 --> 31:40.377
The AO A Honor Society.

31:40.678 --> 31:44.011
Right. Back in medical school.
Anything more recent?

31:46.350 --> 31:47.476
No.

31:47.718 --> 31:50.743
Peter has shown superior commitment,
leadership.

31:50.955 --> 31:53.650
His students come out
stronger than any I've seen.

31:53.857 --> 31:55.257
Well, that's very good.

31:55.458 --> 31:57.050
That's very good indeed.

31:57.460 --> 31:58.620
Thank you.

31:59.296 --> 32:03.493
Thank you for taking the time to
go through the qualifying process.

32:03.699 --> 32:06.566
We won't make a decision
for another two weeks...

32:06.769 --> 32:08.669
...but you'll hear from us then.

32:11.540 --> 32:12.700
Thank you.

32:16.178 --> 32:17.439
Thank you.

32:18.379 --> 32:19.539
Thank you.

32:24.619 --> 32:26.450
Thanks, Peter. You did great.

32:39.700 --> 32:42.760
Hey, Lydia. Will you give
this message to Carter for me?

32:42.969 --> 32:45.733
Sure. I didn't know he was
looking for an apartment.

32:45.938 --> 32:48.997
- There's two in my building.
- Yeah? That makes three.

32:49.208 --> 32:52.005
- Good night, ladies.
- Good night, Jerry.

33:12.429 --> 33:14.555
I hired Mookie today.

33:15.132 --> 33:16.928
That gang kid.

33:17.401 --> 33:20.130
CitiKids Intern Program.

33:20.536 --> 33:23.903
He does volunteer work,
they suspend his sentence...

33:24.107 --> 33:26.166
...and he stays out of juvenile hall.

33:27.609 --> 33:29.907
He starts next week.

33:31.713 --> 33:34.511
I put you down as his supervisor.

33:36.618 --> 33:38.882
- You don't mind?
- It's been a long day.

33:39.087 --> 33:40.816
I could use a quiet night at home.

33:41.023 --> 33:44.151
The lecture's on advances
in cardiomyopathy.

33:44.358 --> 33:46.292
A room full of cardiologists.

33:46.494 --> 33:48.462
I could hit my quota in one night.

33:48.662 --> 33:51.186
Then it's an opportunity
that you shouldn't miss.

33:51.398 --> 33:53.059
I'll make it up to you this weekend.

33:53.266 --> 33:55.564
After last weekend, I believe you.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.336
What?

34:04.544 --> 34:06.374
Since when are you so eager
to be stood up?

34:06.645 --> 34:08.670
Even I need rest.

34:08.914 --> 34:13.009
This is the Murdock chart that
I've been looking for all afternoon.

34:13.552 --> 34:17.545
Call me crazy, but the black dress
looks better without the lab coat.

34:17.755 --> 34:21.452
Just shut up. I can barely
sit here dictating charts like this.

34:21.659 --> 34:22.784
You can in my book.

34:25.163 --> 34:27.255
Happy birthday, Susie-cakes.

34:27.465 --> 34:31.331
<i>Happy birthday to you
Everybody! Come on.</i>

34:31.536 --> 34:34.868
<i>Happy birthday
You live in a zoo</i>

34:35.072 --> 34:36.437
Hey, Billy, this is Susie.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.005
All right. Happy birthday.

34:38.873 --> 34:40.399
Hey! Hi to you too.

34:40.609 --> 34:42.076
This is my sister, Chloe.

34:43.746 --> 34:46.179
- Oh, and this is Billy.
- And, Billy.

34:46.581 --> 34:47.742
Hi, Billy.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.774
Now, we've come to celebrate.

34:50.985 --> 34:52.815
Oh, man. Chloe!

34:53.554 --> 34:57.389
I know this really cool club
where there's dancing. You'll love it.

34:57.592 --> 34:59.617
I'm gonna go take a look at these.

34:59.828 --> 35:00.852
Why don't you come?

35:01.428 --> 35:02.554
I gotta work.

35:02.764 --> 35:03.856
Come on!

35:08.535 --> 35:10.059
Congratulations.

35:10.269 --> 35:11.464
Good night.

35:19.045 --> 35:23.140
Jerry said to give this to you.
There's a couple in my building too.

35:26.451 --> 35:28.613
Wow. This is like the perfect day.

35:31.723 --> 35:34.351
What else are you guys on?
Vodka and what else?

35:34.559 --> 35:38.016
Nothing. I just wanted to
wish you a happy birthday.

35:38.229 --> 35:41.323
So you showed up drunk
with a guy you met an hour ago?

35:41.532 --> 35:43.591
Oh, I did not!

35:43.801 --> 35:46.429
Billy cares about me...

35:46.637 --> 35:48.729
...so just leave him out of it.

35:48.938 --> 35:50.838
I think he is already out of it.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.373
Is he staying at my place too?
Did he help you steal the TV?

35:54.578 --> 35:56.238
Oh, you shut up.

35:56.446 --> 35:57.777
You just shut up, Susie.

35:57.981 --> 36:01.882
You are just like Mom.
You're just like Dad.

36:02.085 --> 36:04.712
You just always hate
everything that I do.

36:05.120 --> 36:06.712
That is not true and you know it.

36:06.922 --> 36:09.857
Nothing was any different at home
for me than it was for you.

36:10.058 --> 36:12.322
- Sure!
- Oh, my God.

36:12.527 --> 36:15.019
I don't know why
I'm having this conversation.

36:15.230 --> 36:18.926
They never thought I could
do anything, you know?

36:19.133 --> 36:22.694
Do you think they thought
I could become a doctor?

36:22.904 --> 36:26.203
I had to prove it to them.
Sometimes I still have to, every day.

36:26.406 --> 36:29.864
You don't know anything
about every day!

36:30.577 --> 36:31.874
You don't know.

36:32.078 --> 36:34.706
You don't have to worry about
paying the rent.

36:34.915 --> 36:37.679
You don't have to worry about
where you'll sleep.

36:37.884 --> 36:41.910
You don't have to worry about
getting a job!

36:52.163 --> 36:53.494
Calm down.

36:54.566 --> 36:56.295
It's gonna be okay.

36:57.702 --> 36:59.693
You're safe here, Chloe.

36:59.903 --> 37:01.462
Do you understand?

37:05.842 --> 37:08.538
Dr. Benton's going to fix your hand.

37:08.979 --> 37:13.643
And then, if you want, you and I
can talk through all this. Okay?

37:43.110 --> 37:44.337
You are pathetic.

37:45.012 --> 37:48.243
What are you doing back?
I thought Jennifer was in town.

37:48.548 --> 37:49.674
So did I.

37:49.883 --> 37:52.350
I thought you had a date
with the drug lady.

37:53.353 --> 37:56.413
She went to a lecture
on cardiomyopathy instead.

37:56.623 --> 37:57.817
Wow. That stings.

37:58.223 --> 37:59.816
Actually, I'm glad.

38:00.026 --> 38:02.186
She might be a little perky for me.

38:03.295 --> 38:04.991
Perky? I thought you liked perky.

38:05.197 --> 38:07.096
Well, this is true. But lately...

38:07.299 --> 38:11.793
...l've found myself attracted to
sullen and withdrawn and confused.

38:13.471 --> 38:16.201
- You ought to go out with me.
- I am out with you.

38:16.407 --> 38:18.102
Oh, my. Oh, my.

38:19.176 --> 38:21.542
Come on! I'm the short guy out here.

38:21.746 --> 38:25.272
There's nothing, you know,
wrong with a little infantile...

38:25.483 --> 38:28.782
...schoolyard competition
to kind of boost the spirits.

38:30.287 --> 38:33.279
Here we go. A little game
of one-on-one, to 21.

38:33.490 --> 38:35.617
- A buck a point.
- You're on.

38:35.824 --> 38:37.086
All right, you ready?

38:40.195 --> 38:41.457
Through the legs.

38:46.502 --> 38:48.470
They're stitching her up now.

38:49.505 --> 38:51.597
She can sleep it off tonight
in Room 3...

38:51.806 --> 38:54.274
...and Benton will find somewhere
to throw Billy.

38:54.475 --> 38:56.739
He ought to find somewhere
to lock him up.

38:57.879 --> 38:59.403
Told you, I don't like surprises.

38:59.746 --> 39:02.579
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. I'm used to it.

39:03.617 --> 39:05.551
Come on, let me get you out of here.

39:05.752 --> 39:07.242
We can still grab some dinner.

39:08.387 --> 39:10.617
No, I don't really feel like it.

39:11.158 --> 39:13.058
I think I'll go up top,
grab some air.

39:13.260 --> 39:15.557
You want some company?

39:16.196 --> 39:17.822
Can I come over later?

39:20.666 --> 39:21.963
Maybe.

39:23.668 --> 39:26.501
I don't know, Div. I'll call you.

39:30.241 --> 39:31.765
So...

39:32.544 --> 39:34.705
...you and Doug were great today.

39:35.512 --> 39:36.536
What?

39:36.748 --> 39:38.807
The 12-year-old, boating accident.

39:39.016 --> 39:40.847
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

39:41.051 --> 39:43.542
Another 10 minutes,
we would've lost him.

39:44.455 --> 39:45.887
I'll see you later.

40:01.436 --> 40:03.199
Hey. Come on in.

40:05.440 --> 40:06.930
Word came down from the O.R.

40:07.142 --> 40:10.804
The kid from the boating accident
came through well. He'll be fine.

40:11.213 --> 40:12.907
That's great news.

40:14.648 --> 40:16.479
Pretty strange day, huh?

40:16.951 --> 40:18.475
You could say that.

40:18.819 --> 40:21.616
I could live the whole thing
all over again.

40:26.826 --> 40:28.817
Doug, John asked me
to move in with him.

40:29.028 --> 40:31.929
I thought I should tell you
that I told him I would.

40:36.969 --> 40:38.800
Did you decide this this afternoon?

40:39.004 --> 40:40.562
We talked about it for a while.

40:40.773 --> 40:44.299
- But did you decide to tell him today?
- It doesn't matter.

40:44.509 --> 40:47.138
What happened with us this afternoon,
does that matter?

40:47.378 --> 40:49.539
What happened was an accident.

40:50.314 --> 40:52.282
There are no accidents.

40:57.387 --> 40:58.616
Look, it's great.

40:58.823 --> 41:01.757
Really, it's great.

41:05.395 --> 41:06.794
Thanks for letting me know.

41:51.370 --> 41:53.702
I can't find anybody
to drink this with me.

41:54.874 --> 41:57.274
I don't know that I'm
the best candidate.

41:57.476 --> 42:00.343
- You are the only one with a birthday.
- Oh, please.

42:00.545 --> 42:03.274
However, you're not the only one
with a crazy family.

42:05.817 --> 42:09.776
My dad says you should never, ever
do this with a bottle of champagne.

42:10.956 --> 42:12.923
Now, if that's not crazy...

42:15.459 --> 42:16.892
Are you ready?

42:17.094 --> 42:19.995
I don't think so, but okay.

42:25.134 --> 42:26.829
- Here.
- Thanks.

42:27.036 --> 42:30.971
You know, Carter, this is a whole side
of you I've never seen before.

42:31.808 --> 42:34.503
What do you mean?
I come up here a lot.

42:35.077 --> 42:36.374
You do?

42:36.578 --> 42:40.139
If you were Dr. Benton's student,
you'd come up here a lot too.

42:41.116 --> 42:45.382
However, today was an excellent day.
I performed my first lumbar puncture.

42:45.587 --> 42:48.020
- How was it?
- Really scary.

42:48.256 --> 42:50.952
Dr. Greene talked me through it.
The patient did have meningitis.

42:51.158 --> 42:54.025
Now he'll be okay.
I guess that's worth a scare.

42:55.028 --> 42:57.497
You know, you can call us
by our first names.

42:57.697 --> 42:58.789
You call me Carter.

42:59.766 --> 43:01.961
Yeah, well, that's different...

43:02.568 --> 43:04.002
...somehow.

43:04.737 --> 43:08.435
So your sister, she's really stuck
on this guy with the greasy hair?

43:08.641 --> 43:10.871
I doubt she knows his last name.
Why?

43:11.076 --> 43:12.270
I was gonna ask her out.

43:14.013 --> 43:15.037
Who are you?

43:15.247 --> 43:16.406
I'm just kidding...

43:16.614 --> 43:18.014
...Susan.

43:18.350 --> 43:19.839
I get it...

43:20.052 --> 43:21.416
...John.

43:22.487 --> 43:24.955
No, it doesn't sound right.

43:25.790 --> 43:28.417
Okay. Call me Carter.
