WEBVTT

00:05.849 --> 00:07.350
Oh, my God! What is that?

00:07.368 --> 00:09.535
I don't want to hear it, okay?
My mother sent it to me.

00:09.570 --> 00:10.653
It belonged to my father.

00:10.687 --> 00:12.071
We have the same exact butt.

00:12.122 --> 00:14.523
- What are you wearing?
- What are <i>you</i> wearing?

00:14.541 --> 00:16.315
I'm dressed for my Booty
Burn Boot Camp class.

00:16.341 --> 00:17.435
I know what you're thinking.

00:17.461 --> 00:19.362
It's not because I need it.
I go to inspire the others.

00:19.380 --> 00:21.881
Please take that thing off.
You look like a homeless pencil.

00:21.915 --> 00:23.549
I will not take it off.
I have a pass.

00:23.584 --> 00:26.202
- A pass? What kind of pass?
- A Dead Dad Pass.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.204
Which means I can do
what I want when I want

00:28.222 --> 00:29.872
and no one can say
anything about it.

00:29.890 --> 00:33.176
Like right now, I want to
tap dance, and you, Jess,

00:33.210 --> 00:35.595
you cannot tell me
that this isn't tap.

00:40.766 --> 00:42.399
Nick, that's just not tap!

00:42.436 --> 00:44.387
- My dad died!
- I'm sorry. It's just not.

00:44.405 --> 00:47.523
Hey, y'all.
Look at these fancy invites.

00:47.557 --> 00:49.442
Do you think it's to a gala event?
I've always wanted to go

00:49.493 --> 00:50.893
- to a gala event.
- Yeah.

00:50.911 --> 00:52.412
What the hell are you wearing?

00:52.446 --> 00:53.613
Dead Dad Pass.

00:53.664 --> 00:55.064
Oh, my God! It's Cece's wedding.

00:55.582 --> 00:56.699
Wait a minute.

00:56.733 --> 00:58.618
It's in three weeks?

00:58.969 --> 01:00.953
- She didn't tell me it was in three weeks.
- Cece didn't

01:01.005 --> 01:03.122
give me a plus-one. How dare
she not give me a plus-one.

01:03.173 --> 01:05.408
You can't invite an ex
to a wedding and not give him

01:05.426 --> 01:07.877
the dignity of consolation sex.
Girl better recognize.

01:07.911 --> 01:10.096
Schmidty gonna go get
his plus-one.

01:11.748 --> 01:13.916
Ew, Nick, what are you doing?

01:14.934 --> 01:16.386
Dead Dad Pass.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.439
♪ Hey, girl

01:19.473 --> 01:21.557
♪ What you doing?

01:22.291 --> 01:24.593

01:38.375 --> 01:41.244
I have not technically been
asked to be maid of honor,

01:41.278 --> 01:42.778
but I am throwing Cece's

01:42.796 --> 01:45.081
surprise bachelorette party
here tonight,

01:45.115 --> 01:47.583
and the only males invited
are strippers,

01:47.617 --> 01:50.002
so oil up or get out, guys.

01:50.754 --> 01:52.922
Seriously though, this is
a really big deal for her.

01:52.956 --> 01:54.807
Some girls plan their weddings,

01:54.842 --> 01:56.759
Cece planned
her bachelorette party.

01:56.793 --> 01:59.679
I want to have the dirtiest
bachelorette party of all time.

01:59.730 --> 02:01.630
Then you better have it
in a pigpen.

02:03.901 --> 02:05.968
No, I mean I want strippers
and a mechanical bull

02:05.986 --> 02:07.603
and balloons in the
shape of ding dongs,

02:07.637 --> 02:09.198
and I want to wear
the kind of underwear

02:09.239 --> 02:11.274
that goes between your cheeks.

02:11.308 --> 02:12.808
I'm also gonna need your help.

02:12.826 --> 02:13.943
- Oh, God. We could've left.
- See. You know what?

02:13.977 --> 02:15.661
We had ample opportunity
to leave.

02:15.696 --> 02:17.330
- I saw it coming miles away and did nothing.
- Me, too.

02:17.364 --> 02:18.814
No. I just need you
to kidnap Shivrang

02:18.832 --> 02:20.450
so I can get Cece alone.

02:20.484 --> 02:22.034
Roughhouse him a little bit,
drop him off in the desert

02:22.086 --> 02:23.286
till he don't breathe no more?

02:24.421 --> 02:26.005
What?!

02:26.039 --> 02:27.490
I'm so happy

02:27.508 --> 02:28.875
you guys could come help.

02:28.926 --> 02:30.393
All the way from India.

02:33.179 --> 02:35.512
Aw, look at all the ladies
bonding.

02:36.049 --> 02:38.634
This is so exciting.
You know, Grandmother

02:38.668 --> 02:41.001
and Ankita Auntie just couldn't
wait to meet you.

02:41.568 --> 02:42.522
Yeah...

02:44.023 --> 02:45.691
Just a little overwhelmed.

02:45.726 --> 02:47.026
- I'm gonna take a...
- I know.

02:48.060 --> 02:49.111
Wait, listen.

02:49.112 --> 02:50.813
Look, babe. Just think.

02:50.847 --> 02:52.482
When all of this madness
is over,

02:52.516 --> 02:54.567
you and I will finally get to,
you know...

02:56.019 --> 02:57.820
What are you doing?

02:57.854 --> 02:59.822
- Freaking me out.
- You know, make love.

02:59.856 --> 03:02.208
Which I am personally
looking forward to greatly.

03:02.242 --> 03:04.410
And we'll already
be married forever.

03:04.461 --> 03:06.302
I'll-I'll get it.

03:08.298 --> 03:10.699
Hello... Shivrang? What
are you doing here?

03:10.717 --> 03:12.752
I, uh...
You stole my question.

03:12.803 --> 03:13.796
Hi. How are you doing?

03:13.822 --> 03:15.555
My invitation didn't
have a plus-one.

03:15.589 --> 03:17.039
If this is a mistake,
I would just like an apology

03:17.057 --> 03:18.418
for the pain
that you've caused me.

03:18.425 --> 03:20.343
Also reimbursement
for all travel expenses.

03:20.377 --> 03:22.178
Not a mistake.
There's no plus-one.

03:22.212 --> 03:23.712
- Who is this?
- I'm Gérard Depardieu.

03:23.730 --> 03:25.881
Do you think I am, lady?
I'm Schmidt.

03:25.899 --> 03:29.232
- Get in my room right now, Schmidt. Move.
- I'm going to your room right now.

03:31.255 --> 03:33.222
Hey, you listen to me. That is
my future family, okay?

03:33.240 --> 03:35.057
You cannot speak like that
in front of them.

03:35.075 --> 03:38.408
And, no, you cannot
have a plus-one.

03:38.495 --> 03:40.530
This wedding has a budget.

03:40.564 --> 03:43.897
Plus-ones are for spouses
and serious partners only.

03:44.901 --> 03:47.253
So you just assume that I won't
have a serious partner by then?

03:47.287 --> 03:48.621
I know for a fact you won't,
okay? You're not

03:48.672 --> 03:49.922
a relationship guy,
and that is fine.

03:49.957 --> 03:51.574
I can do anything I put
my mind to.

03:51.592 --> 03:53.092
I once figured out
Alyssa Milano's phone number

03:53.126 --> 03:54.743
just by randomly
choosing numbers.

03:54.761 --> 03:56.745
Every girl that
I've ever slept with

03:56.763 --> 03:59.131
wants to be my girlfriend.
It's just the way that it is.

03:59.183 --> 04:01.551
If you have a real girlfriend
by the time of the wedding,

04:01.585 --> 04:03.553
- I will happily give you a plus-one.
- Challenge accepted.

04:03.587 --> 04:04.150
Not a challenge.

04:04.176 --> 04:05.830
Time to go make some
dreams come true.

04:05.856 --> 04:07.657
I...

04:07.691 --> 04:09.108
<i>Hey, ladies.</i>

04:09.142 --> 04:11.760
I just want to thank you all
for coming on such short notice

04:11.778 --> 04:14.247
- for Cece's last night of freedom.
- Hi, models.

04:14.281 --> 04:15.931
- Hi.
- I'm a lawyer.

04:15.949 --> 04:16.949
Hi.

04:16.983 --> 04:17.817
I'm Sadie.

04:17.868 --> 04:19.051
I'm a lesbian.

04:19.086 --> 04:20.435
- Hi.
- Hi, lesbian.

04:20.454 --> 04:23.439
I'm 39 weeks large right now.

04:23.957 --> 04:26.075
I can't stand
for more than 60 seconds

04:26.109 --> 04:29.442
but just wanted to say
I'm-I'm so excited to be raging

04:29.546 --> 04:31.280
with you all.

04:31.298 --> 04:34.500
So bring on the cranberry juice,
right?

04:34.551 --> 04:35.951
I need this.

04:35.969 --> 04:37.587
It's really weird.

04:37.621 --> 04:38.921
You're acting really weird.

04:38.955 --> 04:40.789
- So many models.
- I know. I know.

04:40.807 --> 04:42.291
So many.

04:42.309 --> 04:43.926
You can look. Don't touch.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.145
One more thing?
I am a doctor

04:46.179 --> 04:48.981
if anyone's got any areas
they want... looked at.

04:49.016 --> 04:51.317
I'm fine to take a peek.
That's too much.

04:51.351 --> 04:53.102
Don't make me call your wife.

04:53.136 --> 04:55.137
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

04:55.172 --> 04:58.505
Cece's here. Everybody
assume surprise positions!

05:02.078 --> 05:04.530
She's coming. Cece'soming.

05:04.581 --> 05:06.515
I don't get what's happening.

05:06.550 --> 05:07.633
I'm just gonna run upstairs

05:07.668 --> 05:09.669
and quickly grab a CD from Jess.

05:09.703 --> 05:12.655
- I'll come, too.
- That's okay. I... I'll be really fast.

05:12.673 --> 05:13.973
I want to see
what your friends are like.

05:14.007 --> 05:15.824
- Have fun.
- Okay.

05:15.842 --> 05:18.678
- It's gonna be great. It's just Jess.
- Okay.

05:19.212 --> 05:20.680
Bye.

05:21.214 --> 05:22.715
I-I'll be right here.

05:26.970 --> 05:28.337
- Hey.
- Whoa.

05:28.355 --> 05:30.473
Hey, Nick. Sorry,
I thought you were Jane Lynch.

05:30.507 --> 05:33.075
- Jane Lynch. Nice... nice wheels, man.
- Yeah, thank you.

05:33.110 --> 05:34.567
- I'm a bit of a car man myself.
- Right on.

05:34.593 --> 05:36.253
- Well, you know I decided to...
- Good for you.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.681
Too far!

05:38.699 --> 05:40.349
Winston! Oh, take the car.
Take the car.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.485
I'm gonna beat your ass
with an athletic stick, boy!

05:42.519 --> 05:44.570
Winston! Winston!

05:44.621 --> 05:46.706
Jess said to kidnap him,
so that's what I'm doing.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.357
It's a figure of speech,
you idiot.

05:48.375 --> 05:50.025
- You nervous?
- Uh-huh.

05:51.544 --> 05:54.196
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

05:54.214 --> 05:56.215
It's your bachelorette party!

05:56.249 --> 05:58.050
- Jess, I...
- Love it? I know.

05:58.085 --> 05:59.702
Complete
with your favorite game,

05:59.720 --> 06:01.370
Pin the Dong on the Shivrang!

06:01.988 --> 06:05.721
Pin the dong! Pin the dong!

06:06.310 --> 06:08.177
- Oh. Hello.
- Oh.

06:08.211 --> 06:11.680
Um, Jess, this is Ankita-ji,

06:11.714 --> 06:14.547
Shivrang's aunt
all the way from India.

06:15.235 --> 06:16.719
Hello.

06:16.737 --> 06:18.938
Ankita-ji, this is Jess,

06:18.989 --> 06:20.269
my non-blood related
best friend.

06:20.273 --> 06:23.606
Welcome... to California.

06:24.077 --> 06:25.894
May I please use your restroom?

06:25.912 --> 06:27.730
I need to wash my hands.

06:27.748 --> 06:29.898
Yes, of course. It's down
the hall. Um, also

06:29.916 --> 06:32.918
there's a very sexually
aggressive message on the mirror

06:32.953 --> 06:34.920
and I apologize for that.

06:36.757 --> 06:38.829
- Pin the dong.
- Pin it.

06:38.855 --> 06:40.115
I can't.

06:40.627 --> 06:42.094
Come on, Cece.
Get the bull's-eye.

06:44.263 --> 06:45.581
I haven't seen Shivrang's penis.

06:48.985 --> 06:50.102
Oh.

06:50.137 --> 06:51.303
It's that small?

06:52.972 --> 06:55.424
You still know
where it goes though.

06:58.074 --> 07:00.558
It just hit me. I'm about
to commit the rest of my life

07:00.592 --> 07:02.126
to a man
that I have never seen naked.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.078
Cece, chances are he has, like,

07:04.112 --> 07:06.463
a standard
garden-variety penis.

07:06.998 --> 07:09.416
And if we're all really
honest with ourselves,

07:09.450 --> 07:12.136
isn't it all about the gonads?

07:12.170 --> 07:14.955
- Am I right, ladies?
- No.

07:14.973 --> 07:17.291
I'm trying to
make her feel better.

07:17.309 --> 07:19.677
And Ankita cannot hear anything
about this, all right?

07:19.728 --> 07:22.129
She will not understand.
You guys have to promise

07:22.147 --> 07:24.815
to keep it G-rated tonight.

07:24.849 --> 07:26.650
Cece, you've dreamt
of this party your whole life.

07:26.685 --> 07:28.102
I wouldn't want to change it.

07:28.136 --> 07:30.104
- No.
- Really?

07:30.138 --> 07:31.855
- I can't.
- Really?

07:31.907 --> 07:33.140
I can't.

07:34.858 --> 07:35.376
Okay.

07:35.410 --> 07:37.611
Cece, what if it looks
like an old carrot?

07:37.645 --> 07:39.479
What if it's curly?

07:39.497 --> 07:41.332
- Oh, God.
- If he's using it right,

07:41.366 --> 07:44.518
no one's seeing his penis.

07:44.553 --> 07:47.121
Okay, I'm gonna fix this.

07:47.155 --> 07:50.488
So, if Jess is throwing Cece
a surprise bachelorette party,

07:50.508 --> 07:52.876
does that make this
my surprise bachelor party?

07:52.928 --> 07:54.345
You shut that pretty mouth
of yours, Romeo,

07:54.379 --> 07:56.213
before I fill it with fire!

07:56.264 --> 07:58.882
Hey, you got to ease up, Winston.

07:58.916 --> 08:00.017
I got to go.

08:00.051 --> 08:02.376
- Oh, no, no, no. No, don't.
- I got a call.

08:02.402 --> 08:03.212
Please.

08:05.506 --> 08:08.225
I need a picture
of Shivrang's penis.

08:08.276 --> 08:11.511
- Dead Dad Pass! New topic!
- Cece's really freaking out.

08:11.529 --> 08:14.014
- She hasn't seen his penis.
- For the love of God,

08:14.032 --> 08:15.515
Dead Dad Pass.

08:15.533 --> 08:16.650
And I need it to scale,

08:16.684 --> 08:18.152
so please put, like,

08:18.186 --> 08:20.354
a nickel or a big toe

08:20.372 --> 08:23.705
or a golf pencil in there
for reference.

08:23.908 --> 08:25.492
It's not gonna happen!

08:25.526 --> 08:26.860
One picture
and you can come home.

08:26.878 --> 08:28.912
Give me 20 minutes.

08:29.764 --> 08:32.445
If you want to end this, we need to
get a photo of Shivrang's penis.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.418
- There it is.
- Cool.

08:34.469 --> 08:37.721
Hey, Shivrang!
We're liars, man!

08:37.756 --> 08:39.222
We are throwing you

08:39.256 --> 08:42.058
a good old-fashioned
American bachelor party!

08:42.092 --> 08:43.028
Whoops!

08:43.092 --> 08:44.428
Bachelor party! Yeah!

08:44.479 --> 08:47.714
- Whoa! Whoa
- Hey! What are you...

08:47.732 --> 08:49.366
What is wrong with you?!

08:49.401 --> 08:51.385
♪ Come on, come on
♪ <i>Yeah...</i> ♪

08:52.403 --> 08:53.553
I know.

08:53.571 --> 08:55.522
Why don't we talk about
some of the things

08:55.556 --> 08:57.024
that we love about Shivrang?

08:57.558 --> 08:58.725
I'll start. Um...

08:59.243 --> 09:01.011
he has really good
taste in magazines.

09:01.012 --> 09:03.563
- This sucks!
- Boring!

09:03.581 --> 09:04.149
So lame.

09:04.175 --> 09:06.421
Jess, let's put in the slideshow
that you made for Cece.

09:06.451 --> 09:07.734
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:07.752 --> 09:10.237
- Yes! Time for porn cinema.
- No!

09:10.255 --> 09:12.089
Oh, my God, no!

09:12.123 --> 09:14.875
- Oh...
- Oh, my God. No. Guys, guys...

09:15.999 --> 09:18.242
How are we gonna get a
picture of Shivrang's junk?

09:20.197 --> 09:21.965
Well, spoiler alert:

09:22.017 --> 09:23.801
- Women are liars.
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:23.852 --> 09:25.636
They're supposed to want
commitment, right?

09:26.187 --> 09:28.639
But then I offer it to them
on a silver platter

09:28.690 --> 09:31.091
and they throw it back
in my face like a comedy pie.

09:31.109 --> 09:33.260
I know this is awkward
because we slept together,

09:33.278 --> 09:34.445
and I never returned

09:34.479 --> 09:35.779
any of your phone calls,

09:35.814 --> 09:37.264
so this might come
as a shock to you,

09:37.282 --> 09:39.950
but... will you
be my girlfriend?

09:40.984 --> 09:42.403
Oh, God.

09:42.437 --> 09:45.406
I thought you had herpes.

09:45.940 --> 09:48.709
But no to the girlfriend,
you dick.

09:49.777 --> 09:51.328
Do you remember two years ago

09:51.379 --> 09:53.464
when we were watching coverage
of the BP oil spill

09:53.498 --> 09:55.115
and doing it
during the commercials

09:55.133 --> 09:57.334
and then you asked me if
I wanted a serious relationship

09:57.335 --> 10:00.087
and I laughed in your face?

10:00.121 --> 10:03.454
Well, my new answer... is yes.

10:05.894 --> 10:07.177
Be my girlfriend!

10:10.482 --> 10:12.466
What's that all about?

10:13.901 --> 10:16.103
Cream cheese in bulk?

10:16.137 --> 10:17.471
I mean, it's possible
that Cece's right.

10:17.489 --> 10:18.939
I mean, maybe I'm just not

10:19.473 --> 10:21.442
a serious relationship
kind of guy.

10:21.476 --> 10:22.609
What are you talking about?

10:22.643 --> 10:24.611
You dated Elizabeth
for, like...

10:24.645 --> 10:26.113
- for years.
- Yeah.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.698
Elizabeth?

10:27.749 --> 10:29.700
Yeah, but Elizabeth
doesn't count.

10:29.751 --> 10:31.335
She was during
my "Big Guy" period.

10:32.871 --> 10:35.172
So you like the foot rub?
Softer? Harder?

10:35.206 --> 10:36.540
That's perfect, Big Guy.

10:36.591 --> 10:38.509
Look at all these little toes.

10:38.543 --> 10:41.795
All my little toesies feel so
good when you rub 'em, though.

10:41.829 --> 10:44.548
This little... this
little one went to market.

10:44.599 --> 10:46.049
If Elizabeth doesn't count,

10:46.101 --> 10:48.385
then why is it seared
into my brain forever?

10:48.436 --> 10:50.020
You were awfully
salty about that.

10:50.054 --> 10:51.004
She counts.

10:51.022 --> 10:52.339
We need to make Cece jealous,

10:52.357 --> 10:53.724
and I don't think that's the route
we want to take.

10:53.775 --> 10:55.008
Then go to the wedding alone.

10:55.026 --> 10:56.810
- Oh.
- Well, then, go with Elizabeth.

10:56.844 --> 10:58.529
Great idea, Winston.
I'm gonna ask Elizabeth.

10:58.563 --> 11:00.731
Yeah. You were of no help
to me, Nick.

11:00.782 --> 11:02.516
That's what... my whole
thing about the whole thing

11:02.534 --> 11:04.067
with Elizabeth was that
I was also suggesting...

11:04.119 --> 11:05.819
- Thanks, guys.
- You're an idiot, dude.

11:05.853 --> 11:07.204
You're the worst.
You guys were...

11:07.238 --> 11:08.489
How did you know we were here?

11:08.523 --> 11:11.208
Oh! Oh, I just couldn't decide.

11:11.242 --> 11:13.076
Your country's refusal
to embrace Robbie Williams

11:13.128 --> 11:14.545
will forever baffle me.

11:14.579 --> 11:16.046
Well, I got to say,
we're really glad

11:16.080 --> 11:17.548
you're back at the table
with us, Shivrang.

11:17.582 --> 11:19.533
- <i>Shivrung.</i>
- Let's play a classic

11:19.551 --> 11:21.885
- bachelor party game right now.
- Mm-hmm, all right.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.837
- I'm gonna take a photo of my junk.
- Oh, no, you're not.

11:23.871 --> 11:24.371
Yeah, I am.

11:24.397 --> 11:26.373
- What?
- 'Cause this is what we do in America, Shivrang.

11:26.391 --> 11:27.591
- Don't think that's much of a competition
- Oh...

11:27.642 --> 11:29.563
I work here. It doesn't matter.
They're not gonna fire me.

11:29.589 --> 11:30.043
Oh, okay.

11:30.061 --> 11:31.428
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

11:31.479 --> 11:33.013
- Okay. Yup.
- Just...

11:33.047 --> 11:35.065
That is my junk
in a photo. Okay.

11:35.099 --> 11:36.733
It's your turn, Shivrang.
Take a photo of your junk.

11:36.768 --> 11:37.851
Oh, no. No, thanks.

11:37.885 --> 11:38.936
We're all doing it.

11:38.987 --> 11:40.555
- No, it's not... Absolutely not.
- I'm begging you.

11:40.581 --> 11:41.964
But I will get us
another round of drinks.

11:41.990 --> 11:42.906
- Take the photo...
- Take the picture, Shivrang.

11:42.941 --> 11:44.691
Who fancies a shandy?

11:44.725 --> 11:45.725
What the hell is that?

11:45.743 --> 11:47.394
It's a drink.

11:47.412 --> 11:50.364
Two for you guys
coming right up.

11:51.248 --> 11:52.866
Cece actually designed
that toilet.

11:54.085 --> 11:55.902
Cece was a volunteer nurse,
and, um...

11:56.920 --> 11:58.705
No bottoms?

11:59.239 --> 12:02.072
You know, what-what happens
in Orlando stays in Orlando.

12:02.760 --> 12:03.544
Nadia,

12:03.578 --> 12:04.628
seriously, turn it off.

12:06.579 --> 12:07.965
Cece, is this how you like

12:08.016 --> 12:09.416
to spend time with your friends?

12:09.434 --> 12:11.418
Is this the kind of wife
you want to be?

12:11.436 --> 12:13.053
No, no. It's not at all, okay?

12:13.087 --> 12:14.754
I didn't even know
this party was happening.

12:14.772 --> 12:16.306
It was a surprise.

12:16.357 --> 12:18.809
I promise you,
this is so not me.

12:18.860 --> 12:21.428
I didn't want any of it.

12:26.266 --> 12:29.402
Cece, you wanted a bachelorette
party ever since I've known you.

12:29.436 --> 12:31.271
Why do you have to pretend
to be somebody you're not?

12:31.306 --> 12:32.192
What are you saying?

12:32.218 --> 12:34.608
I'm just saying, this is all
moving really, really fast,

12:34.626 --> 12:36.360
and maybe you need to get to
know Shivrang a little bit more,

12:36.412 --> 12:37.812
and maybe you need
to slow this down

12:37.910 --> 12:39.113
so he can get to know you.

12:39.447 --> 12:40.648
I'm getting married
in three weeks.

12:40.682 --> 12:43.002
Are you saying that I shouldn't
get married in three weeks?

12:43.501 --> 12:45.636
- No. I'm just saying that maybe you should...
- I knew it! I knew it!

12:45.670 --> 12:48.305
You have been against this
wedding from the beginning.

12:48.339 --> 12:51.057
Fine! I don't think
you should marry Shivrang

12:51.075 --> 12:54.060
if it means you
have to change who you are.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.298
Yeah, well, I don't need
to take relationship advice

12:58.316 --> 13:00.350
from a girl who's in the middle
of a seventh grade debacle

13:00.401 --> 13:02.102
with a boy across the hall!

13:02.136 --> 13:04.688
- Oh!
- "Oh, I'm a single adult, and I kissed another

13:04.739 --> 13:06.656
single adult.
What's gonna happen?"

13:06.690 --> 13:07.608
"Does Nick like me?

13:07.642 --> 13:09.476
"I better go pick out
a party dress.

13:09.494 --> 13:11.311
- I wear pajama sets!"
- You question

13:11.329 --> 13:14.314
my pajamas, you make me question
our entire friendship.

13:14.332 --> 13:14.975
Let's say it, Jess!

13:15.001 --> 13:16.667
You never asked me to
be your maid of honor.

13:16.701 --> 13:18.001
It's awful hot in here.

13:18.036 --> 13:19.119
Who wants to cool down

13:19.153 --> 13:20.537
with a double scoop

13:20.588 --> 13:22.005
of Alfredo?

13:22.040 --> 13:24.324
- Not now, Alfredo!
- Seriously?

to the candy shop ♪

13:26.910 --> 13:29.543

13:36.170 --> 13:38.438
Congratulations, Cece.

13:41.419 --> 13:43.419
Well, chaps, I guess
we'll just have to make our own.

13:43.454 --> 13:45.705
But first, I have
to use the bathroom.

13:46.256 --> 13:48.657
See you in a minute.
This is fun.

13:48.675 --> 13:50.094
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

13:51.075 --> 13:51.994
Yeah.

13:52.829 --> 13:54.964
- Fire...!
- Oh!

13:54.998 --> 13:57.133
- Real fire. This fire is real.
- Fire!

13:57.167 --> 13:58.334
Whoa!

13:58.352 --> 13:59.969
What are you doing? You were
supposed to take the picture.

14:00.003 --> 14:01.387
Aah! It's burning so fast!

14:01.438 --> 14:03.839
- Go put it out!
- You... Oh!

14:03.857 --> 14:06.025
Look, you guys are acting
really, really peculiar.

14:06.026 --> 14:06.943
What is going on?

14:06.977 --> 14:10.229
What is going on...
is that, uh...

14:11.280 --> 14:12.949
recently I've been
one-half orphaned.

14:13.983 --> 14:14.743
- I'm sorry.
- My-my

14:14.785 --> 14:16.152
dad passed away.

14:16.186 --> 14:17.536
We orphans, man!

14:17.571 --> 14:19.038
And it would mean the world

14:19.072 --> 14:21.373
to us-- not so much--

14:21.408 --> 14:23.042
- if, uh...
- I miss Walt so much.

14:23.076 --> 14:24.710
If we can get a
photo of your penis.

14:24.744 --> 14:26.412
Wait. What? I'm sor...

14:26.463 --> 14:27.663
It would help with the
grieving, it would just...

14:27.697 --> 14:28.798
For Walt, man.

14:28.832 --> 14:29.915
All right, all right, enough!

14:29.966 --> 14:31.300
Okay.

14:31.334 --> 14:34.667
We need a photo
for... for Cece.

14:35.305 --> 14:35.922
Cece?

14:35.948 --> 14:38.390
Yeah. She's freaking out 'cause
she's never seen you naked.

14:38.425 --> 14:40.593
And she's afraid
it looks all funky.

14:40.644 --> 14:42.978
So just show us that it looks
regular, and we all go home.

14:43.013 --> 14:44.647
She's freaking out?

14:44.681 --> 14:47.016
Look, guys, I've-I've got to go.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.101
I have... I have to talk to her.

14:49.152 --> 14:51.404
Oh, you're... We're all in
the same car. Ugh!

14:51.438 --> 14:53.072
You know, I'm gonna
take care of this.

14:53.106 --> 14:54.240
How are you gonna take of this?

14:54.274 --> 14:56.409
Crop, rotate,
rotate... and send.

14:56.443 --> 14:57.911
- What are you doing?
- I mean, this.

14:57.945 --> 14:59.471
- I just send a picture of your penis to Jess
- No!

14:59.497 --> 15:00.997
- ...and told her it was Shivrang's.
- No!

15:01.032 --> 15:03.032
- So now, we good.
- You did not just do that.

15:03.066 --> 15:04.500
Oh.

15:05.769 --> 15:08.253
- Shivrang.
- What, Shivrang? Shivrang, what?

15:08.288 --> 15:09.755
- What?
- No, nothing. It's nothing. Don't.

15:09.789 --> 15:11.840
- Oh, my God.
- "Shivrang's Shiv"?

15:11.874 --> 15:13.892
You got your idiot roommates to kidnap

15:13.943 --> 15:16.260
- my fiancé to take a picture of his penis?
- Well, you were freaking out!

15:16.261 --> 15:18.262
Well, see...
Three more weeks of winter.

15:18.315 --> 15:19.432
Oh, my God.

15:20.467 --> 15:22.718
- What are you doing?
- Get out!

15:22.769 --> 15:26.102
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
I immediately regret that.

15:26.106 --> 15:27.808
- Show me!
- Okay.

15:35.615 --> 15:39.401
You are scared because you haven't seen
your future husband's manhood?

15:39.652 --> 15:42.785
Where I come from,
women cry about this for days.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

16:03.908 --> 16:05.010
This is real.

16:05.244 --> 16:06.979
This is not a dream.

16:08.214 --> 16:10.399
Look, I've kept off the weight.

16:10.433 --> 16:14.266
You knew me when action sandals
were my necessary footwear.

16:14.888 --> 16:16.989
- What do you want?
- Why do you think I want something?

16:17.024 --> 16:18.524
Because I dated
you for four years.

16:18.558 --> 16:20.826
I know when you want
something. What do you want?

16:20.861 --> 16:23.162
I would like to take you
to a wedding, because I miss you

16:23.196 --> 16:25.031
- so much...
- No, I can't take you seriously

16:25.065 --> 16:26.749
when you're wearing
such tight pants.

16:26.783 --> 16:28.501
Get to the point.

16:28.535 --> 16:32.368
Okay, look, my model
ex-girlfriend

16:32.456 --> 16:34.924
is getting married
to some small little Indian man

16:34.958 --> 16:36.425
who I just don't understand.

16:36.460 --> 16:39.461
Okay, and I want you
to pretend to be my girlfriend

16:39.512 --> 16:41.547
so she gets very sad, and then,
breaks off the wedding,

16:41.581 --> 16:42.965
and then, runs away with me.

16:43.016 --> 16:44.216
- No. Not a chance.
- No?

16:44.500 --> 16:45.884
Wait, wait, wait, please.

16:45.936 --> 16:47.353
Elizabeth?

16:47.387 --> 16:49.104
I'm only gonna say this once.

16:49.139 --> 16:51.357
You were the greatest boyfriend.

16:51.391 --> 16:53.225
I loved Big Guy.

16:53.276 --> 16:56.609
But then, you lost weight,
and you got mean.

16:58.231 --> 17:00.733
You stopped listening to me.

17:00.784 --> 17:02.534
You changed completely.

17:03.069 --> 17:04.536
You stopped paying
for my dinner.

17:06.156 --> 17:08.123
Elizabeth, to be fair,

17:08.157 --> 17:11.410
at that point, you were eating
the lion's share of the food.

17:11.461 --> 17:13.628
And you were sitting there
eating one basil leaf,

17:13.663 --> 17:15.497
looking like an
idiot panda bear.

17:15.531 --> 17:18.717
- Well...
- Look, I loved Big Guy

17:18.752 --> 17:20.469
with all my heart.

17:20.502 --> 17:24.839
But I have no interest in helping the guy
who's standing in front of me now.

17:24.874 --> 17:28.207
I hate your hair.

17:28.328 --> 17:31.661
And I looked, and I looked, and
I couldn't find it. Where is it?

17:31.765 --> 17:33.148
And then, I realized,

17:33.183 --> 17:35.267
uh-oh.

17:35.318 --> 17:38.103
That is not his leg.

17:40.857 --> 17:43.025
Oh, hey, uh, Jess,
uh, please tell me...

17:43.059 --> 17:45.861
Hey... that nobody's looked
at your photos in your phone.

17:45.895 --> 17:48.163
Um... you're too late.

17:48.198 --> 17:49.415
Cece looked at it.

17:49.449 --> 17:51.700
We all looked at it.

17:51.734 --> 17:53.419
Prize hog, Shivrang.

17:53.453 --> 17:55.621
- Yeah...
- I'm so sorry

17:55.672 --> 17:57.089
- they made you do it.
- Oh, it's okay.

17:57.124 --> 17:58.941
Actually, it wasn't mine.

17:59.476 --> 18:00.984
- What?!
- What?! Whose was it?

18:01.011 --> 18:02.127
It was mine.

18:02.178 --> 18:04.263
What?! No way!

18:04.297 --> 18:05.798
- Yeah, it was, uh... Those were my privates.
- Are you serious?

18:05.849 --> 18:08.267
I'm serious. Give me my phone.
I want it back now.

18:08.301 --> 18:09.685
I have a Dead Dad Pass.
I have a Dead Dad Pass!

18:09.719 --> 18:11.053
No! No! It's my property!

18:11.087 --> 18:12.554
What is going on here?

18:12.588 --> 18:14.723
And why is Alfredo crying
in the elevator?

18:14.757 --> 18:17.559
- Hello, you.
- What's up, Nadia?

18:20.027 --> 18:22.778
It's just... it's just that
there's so much we don't know

18:22.779 --> 18:25.414
- about each other, and I...
- It's fine. That's it. I'm showing it to you.

18:25.448 --> 18:26.631
I'm showing you my software.

18:26.666 --> 18:28.500
No, no, no! No, no!

18:28.551 --> 18:30.135
- It's called hardware, Jack.
- Yeah.

18:30.169 --> 18:31.803
If it run, I catch it.

18:31.838 --> 18:33.518
I mean, I don't want to see it.
I do. Okay.

18:33.556 --> 18:36.141
But not-not... not here.

18:36.175 --> 18:37.759
I'm sorry.

18:37.794 --> 18:39.644
It's just, you know, I-I...

18:39.679 --> 18:41.797
Sometimes it feels like
we're just moving so fast,

18:41.831 --> 18:43.815
and I feel crazy
that we're just...

18:44.350 --> 18:47.683
jumping in blindly.

18:47.803 --> 18:50.588
But maybe that's what
makes this special.

18:51.123 --> 18:53.858
It's just a real
leap of faith, Shivrang.

18:53.909 --> 18:56.444
Yeah, uh, but look,
the first thing

18:56.478 --> 18:58.530
that you need to
know about me is

18:58.581 --> 19:01.649
that it's actually
pronounced <i>Shivrung.</i>

19:01.667 --> 19:03.788
I don't know how to
pronounce your name?!

19:03.814 --> 19:06.171
No, no. You were just so pretty,
I didn't want to correct you.

19:06.172 --> 19:07.539
But look, the most
important thing

19:07.573 --> 19:10.041
is that I am gonna do my best

19:10.075 --> 19:12.510
to make you the happiest woman
on the face of the earth.

19:20.553 --> 19:22.771
Shavvy's getting nasty.

19:23.305 --> 19:24.722
Shavvy a dog.

19:24.756 --> 19:25.890
Shavvy?

19:25.908 --> 19:27.425
We're friends now.

19:27.443 --> 19:29.110
Dead Dad Pass.

19:33.482 --> 19:34.115
Hey.

19:35.784 --> 19:37.702
Look, Cece...

19:37.737 --> 19:39.654
I just wanted to say that

19:39.705 --> 19:41.823
if I was ever selfish
in our relationship...

19:41.874 --> 19:44.442
What do you mean, "if," and what
do you mean, "relationship"?

19:44.960 --> 19:47.612
That's fair. Um...

19:47.880 --> 19:50.298
if I was...

19:50.332 --> 19:52.834
I sincerely apologize.

19:52.868 --> 19:56.170
So, challenge unaccepted.
I don't want a plus-one.

19:57.706 --> 19:59.507
I'm really happy for you.

19:59.541 --> 20:02.143
Thank you.

20:05.147 --> 20:06.365
Good night, Schmidt.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.783
Schmidty out.

20:09.051 --> 20:10.985
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:11.020 --> 20:13.387
I just want to say, um,
I'm really sorry about...

20:13.405 --> 20:15.773
No. I'm-I'm...
I'm sorry.

20:16.324 --> 20:17.558
And there's, uh...

20:18.076 --> 20:20.078
There's something I've
been wanting to ask you.

20:20.112 --> 20:22.396
It's not traditional
in Indian weddings

20:22.414 --> 20:24.866
to have a maid of honor, but...

20:24.900 --> 20:27.401
I would really love it
if you would be mine.

20:27.419 --> 20:29.754
Yeah. I mean, I don't know...

20:29.788 --> 20:31.405
What?!

20:31.423 --> 20:34.756
Yes! Oh, my God, thank you
so much for asking me!

20:38.213 --> 20:40.748
I paid. All yours,
no judgments.

20:40.766 --> 20:42.300
Why'd you come back, Schmidt?

20:42.351 --> 20:44.052
The Big Guy is...

20:44.086 --> 20:45.970
Well, he's still
somewhere inside

20:46.021 --> 20:48.756
this... perfect body.

20:48.774 --> 20:51.559
He needs you to coax him out
a little bit.

20:51.593 --> 20:53.227
Please tell him
what to do next.

20:53.261 --> 20:54.212
Eat the pizza.

20:54.247 --> 20:56.030
Eat all the pizza...

20:56.065 --> 20:58.900
while I watch... right now.

21:00.434 --> 21:01.886
Okay.

21:03.605 --> 21:05.226
Oh. It's so greasy.

21:05.805 --> 21:07.226
So many carbs.

21:08.005 --> 21:10.226
Hey guys...
Oh boy.

21:11.952 --> 21:14.754
Welcome home, melted cheese.

21:15.088 --> 21:17.239
Oh.

21:20.845 --> 21:23.296
I don't even know
what pepperoni's made of.

21:23.347 --> 21:25.598
It's so good.

21:25.633 --> 21:27.434
Is that your happy
dance, big boy?

21:27.468 --> 21:29.385
I love it.

21:29.419 --> 21:30.937
- Oh, there he is.
- Yup.

21:30.971 --> 21:32.921
There's my big guy.

21:32.939 --> 21:35.274
It's like waking up
from a bad salad dream.

21:35.309 --> 21:37.377
