00:00.320 --> 00:02.400
Previously on "The Rookie"...
Bianca, right? Heroin?

00:02.400 --> 00:03.810
You're gonna become
an informant.

00:03.810 --> 00:05.740
I've been instructing
Officer West about how patrol

00:05.770 --> 00:07.140
can leverage
lower-level criminals.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.480
Perhaps earn some goodwill
prior to your detectives exam?

00:09.480 --> 00:11.400
What's wrong?
Jason is in ICU.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.810
Think this will
move you down the list?

00:12.810 --> 00:14.100
Are you kidding?
I'm off the list.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.640
Ripper.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.600
You used to hang with Eva.
Yeah, for a minute.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.520
Because she stole from me.
We got to get in there.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.730
Eva already
caught her beating.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.520
But since you're feeling
so generous,

00:22.520 --> 00:23.980
I do have a job
you could help with.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.690
Whoa!
That's my old man.

00:25.690 --> 00:27.100
Walk away.
Make me.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.100
See you around.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.850
Mr. Singer.
Step out, please.

00:33.850 --> 00:35.980
Releasing me so soon?

00:35.980 --> 00:37.770
I was just
getting comfortable.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.140
Nope.
It's lineup time.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.400
But don't worry.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.900
Once you get ID'd,
you'll have plenty of time

00:41.900 --> 00:43.060
to get comfortable
in prison.

00:43.060 --> 00:44.060
Let's go.

00:44.060 --> 00:46.060

I'm just not sure.

01:28.560 --> 01:30.600
It's okay.
We appreciate your help.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.270
Thank you.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.400
Officer Chen,
release the lineup.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.520
You were saying something
about a "long-term" stay?

01:39.730 --> 01:40.810
She ID you?

01:40.810 --> 01:43.900
Nope. Hit 'em hard,

Yeah.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.730
Nice.
Wait! That's entrapment!

02:00.730 --> 02:02.270
Uh, you're wrong.

02:02.270 --> 02:04.600
There's no legal
expectation of privacy
within a police station.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.140
Anything you say here
can be used against you.

02:06.140 --> 02:08.770

02:08.770 --> 02:10.810

after episode 12.

02:23.770 --> 02:27.440
Oh. So only nine more hours
of being bored out of my mind.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.520
Pass.

02:28.520 --> 02:29.730
I like it.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.140
I think it's subtle

02:31.140 --> 02:32.810
and nuanced.

02:32.810 --> 02:34.980
I suppose you'd rather
watch "Action Heist"?

02:34.980 --> 02:36.730
Any day.

02:36.730 --> 02:38.730
Okay, they have a shark attack
on an elevator, Sterling.

02:38.730 --> 02:40.600
And it was awesome.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.480
You know what? It doesn't
even matter what we watch,

02:42.480 --> 02:44.600
because I won't be
looking at the screen anyway.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.560
Sugarfish?
You guys are the best!
W--

02:46.560 --> 02:48.060
Come on, let me in!
Let me in!
Uh...

02:48.060 --> 02:49.350
I thought you were hanging out
with Rachel tonight.

02:49.350 --> 02:51.140
Yeah, no.

02:51.140 --> 02:54.310
I canceled because tonight is
a new episode of "Action Heist."

02:54.310 --> 02:56.190
Bam!

02:56.190 --> 02:58.440
Previously on "Action Heist"...

02:59.730 --> 03:02.060
Lastly, the brass
wants us to increase

03:02.060 --> 03:04.270
our social media presence
within the community.

03:04.270 --> 03:05.980
We're cops,
not influencers.

03:05.980 --> 03:08.140
Like it or not,
Officer Bradford, you're both.

03:08.140 --> 03:11.350
A strong relationship with
the public makes us all safer.

03:11.350 --> 03:13.020
So let's show them
we're people, too.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.270
Get out there,
take a few selfies.

03:15.270 --> 03:16.520
Yes, Officer Nolan?

03:16.520 --> 03:18.690
Back in Foxburg,
I knew most of the cops by name.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.020
Because there were
four of them.

03:21.270 --> 03:22.810
Five, but the number
didn't matter.

03:22.810 --> 03:25.270
It's just that they spent
most of their time on foot.

03:25.270 --> 03:27.230
I mean, how are we supposed
to take a selfie with someone

03:27.230 --> 03:28.810
when we're trapped in our shop
most of the day?

03:28.810 --> 03:30.480
That's a good point.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.270
We do spend too much time
locked inside our shops.

03:33.270 --> 03:35.060
New plan.

03:35.060 --> 03:37.230
Everyone spends the morning
on foot patrol.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.850
Good one, Officer Nolan.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.770
I can tell
what you're thinking.
Doubt it.

03:51.770 --> 03:53.060
You're working out
how to kill me

03:53.060 --> 03:54.640
without your body cam
catching it.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.480
Yeah, actually,
that is what I was thinking.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.310
Mommy! Policeman!

03:58.310 --> 03:59.440
Hi, there, buddy.
What's your name?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.140
Sam.
Is that a real gun?

04:01.140 --> 04:02.600
It sure is.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.770
Can I hold it?
Oh!

04:03.770 --> 04:05.770
No. That's, uh --
That's against the rules.

04:05.770 --> 04:09.350
But I do have some stickers
here for you.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.640
Thanks!
You bet, buddy.
Have a good day.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.940
See? That was great!

04:13.940 --> 04:15.770
There are four felonies an hour
in Los Angeles.

04:15.770 --> 04:18.190
But, no,
that was a good use of time.

04:19.899 --> 04:22.230
I've got no problem
with community engagement.

04:22.230 --> 04:24.560
Citizens play a vital role
in policing.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.730
The more they like us,
the more they help us.

04:26.730 --> 04:28.730
That's a surprisingly
enlightened attitude.

04:28.730 --> 04:31.640
Yo -- Yo, officers.
Uh, I got a legal question.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.020
Sorry, we're not real cops.
We're extras.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.480
There's a movie shoot
down the street.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.770
Oh.

04:36.770 --> 04:38.600
Cool. Thanks.

04:40.190 --> 04:43.020
What am I? Google?
Do your own research.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.020
Look, don't get me wrong.

04:45.020 --> 04:47.270
I love hanging out with Lucy,
and I know she's, like,

04:47.270 --> 04:50.100
slow-rolling back
to the dating scene, but...

04:50.100 --> 04:51.310
I miss my boyfriend.

04:51.310 --> 04:52.730
So tell her that.
I can't.

04:52.730 --> 04:54.940
She's still in,
like, a delicate place.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.440
Then forget about
having any alone time

04:56.440 --> 04:57.980
in the foreseeable future.

04:57.980 --> 05:01.230
7-Adam-07, attaching
you to a possible 187.

05:01.230 --> 05:03.690
Husband arrived home to find
wife bleeding and unresponsive.

05:03.690 --> 05:05.020
Detectives en route.
Thank God.

05:05.020 --> 05:06.940
7-Adam-07,
show us responding.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.640
How much did you pay Dispatch
to give us the first call?

05:08.640 --> 05:10.140
A bottle of
Wesley's fancy wine.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.640
So worth it.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.440
Police!

05:14.810 --> 05:16.810
Police officers!
Is there anyone here?

05:20.850 --> 05:22.400
Jackson.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
Sir?

05:30.230 --> 05:32.810
I came home
to surprise her.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.230
Who would've done this?

05:34.230 --> 05:36.440
7-Adam-07,
Code 4 at our location.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.940
Copy. Detectives are
on their way.

05:37.940 --> 05:39.900
Sir, you have to
let her go and come with us.

05:39.900 --> 05:40.940
Come on.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.310
What do we got?
Watch him.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.100
Detective Calderon,
we just got here. We have --

05:54.100 --> 05:55.690
What's he doing here?

05:55.690 --> 05:57.350
This is a crime scene.
He's a suspect.

05:57.350 --> 05:58.770
Yes, ma'am.
We were just about --

05:58.770 --> 06:00.310
Forget it.
I'll deal with him.

06:00.310 --> 06:01.850
You two,
go and canvass the neighbors.

06:05.230 --> 06:06.730
What's her problem?

06:06.730 --> 06:08.520
I have no idea.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.350
Say "Waste
of Police Resources."

06:10.350 --> 06:11.850
Cheese!

06:13.730 --> 06:16.480
Thank you, sir. We'll be sure
to tag you in the post.

06:16.480 --> 06:20.480
You know,
attitude is everything.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.940
Drug deal.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.400
Without the shop,
there's no way

06:25.400 --> 06:27.140
we can roll up on them
without them seeing us.

06:27.140 --> 06:28.600
Wrong.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.230
Put your hand
over your collar, like this.

06:31.230 --> 06:32.520
You're saying
if we cover our badges,

06:32.520 --> 06:33.690
they're not
gonna notice us?

06:33.690 --> 06:34.940
Yep. Watch.

06:41.770 --> 06:43.770
Hi, there!

06:43.770 --> 06:45.350
Cops!

06:46.900 --> 06:48.350
Bianca?

06:48.350 --> 06:49.520
John.

06:53.060 --> 06:54.270
I can explain.

06:54.270 --> 06:56.690
You just got
your 30-day chip.

06:56.690 --> 06:58.770
I know. I know.

06:58.770 --> 07:00.730
But I'm making
minimum wage.

07:00.730 --> 07:02.770
My mom's sick,
and the medication's expensive.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.810
That's rough.
You're under arrest.

07:04.810 --> 07:06.560
Please. I can help,
like last time.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.520
You mean when you bailed out
the window and then you OD'd?

07:08.520 --> 07:10.770
Yeah,
that was such a help.

07:10.770 --> 07:11.940
Hook her up.

07:11.940 --> 07:12.850
Turn around.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.100
It's different now,
okay?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.980
I'm clean.

07:15.980 --> 07:17.850
I know about
a huge score.

07:17.850 --> 07:19.310
A ton of fentanyl.

07:22.060 --> 07:24.230
Don't lie to me, Bianca.

07:24.230 --> 07:26.020
I would never lie to you,
John.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.640
Who's selling
the fentanyl?

07:29.640 --> 07:30.690
Uh, Curtis.

07:30.690 --> 07:31.980
Curtis have a last name?

07:31.980 --> 07:34.980
I don't know it,
but everyone calls him Ripper.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.640
Do you think
Rachel's disappointed

07:39.640 --> 07:40.690
I canceled last night?

07:40.690 --> 07:42.190
Don't know.

07:42.190 --> 07:43.350
Man, I felt bad.

07:43.350 --> 07:44.940
She found this bartender

07:44.940 --> 07:47.440
that tailors cocktails
to your astrological sign.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.730
It sounded cool.
I just --

07:48.730 --> 07:50.310
I was tired,
and I needed a night in.

07:50.310 --> 07:52.520
She gets that, right?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.940
You might find this surprising,
but we don't talk about you.

07:54.940 --> 07:56.190
Ever.
Wow.

07:56.900 --> 07:57.980
Police!

08:10.690 --> 08:12.400
Control, 7-Adam-19.
Requesting an RA unit.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.690
He came out of nowhere!
Palmetto and Mateo.

08:14.690 --> 08:16.690
Head verse vehicle. CT.

08:16.690 --> 08:18.600
Okay, stay still.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.690
Oh, man, I think
it got into an artery.

08:19.690 --> 08:20.980
There's a lot of blood.

08:20.980 --> 08:22.560
Okay.
Aah!

08:22.560 --> 08:23.980
Here.

08:23.980 --> 08:27.600
You can use this scarf and pen
to make a tourniquet.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.690
Thank you.

08:29.690 --> 08:32.190
Place it two inches
above the wound.

08:34.980 --> 08:35.980
Okay.

08:41.309 --> 08:43.100
Alright,
the bleeding's stopped.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.980
Am I gonna get a badge
for this?

08:47.520 --> 08:48.640
So...

08:48.640 --> 08:50.190
...been hanging
with Bianca?

08:50.190 --> 08:52.100
Hanging? Well,
I got her into a program.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.770
Kept an eye on her.
Pulled back once she got clean.

08:54.770 --> 08:56.100
Didn't want her
to get confused.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.940
I don't think that worked.

08:57.940 --> 08:59.640
Girl just got arrested,
but she seems more upset

08:59.640 --> 09:01.140
that she disappointed you.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.310
I didn't see that.

09:02.310 --> 09:04.350
I did.

09:04.350 --> 09:07.020
Still, I wonder if she would've
slipped if I'd been around.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.520
Don't do that.

09:08.520 --> 09:09.900
This is on her, not you.

09:14.690 --> 09:16.600
So, you sure this tip
is solid?

09:16.600 --> 09:18.100
I know how badly
you want to get Ripper.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.850
Judge thought so.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.310
Gave us a no-knock warrant
based on Nolan's CI.

09:22.310 --> 09:24.940
Bianca insists Ripper is sitting
on a huge supply of fentanyl.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.810
I didn't know
he was that big of a player.

09:26.810 --> 09:28.100
He didn't used to be.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.480
Looks like he's making a move
for the big time.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.400
You ready, Sergeant?

09:35.100 --> 09:37.270
Alright.
Let's go get this guy.

09:43.730 --> 09:45.480
What the hell?

09:52.310 --> 09:54.350
DEA.

09:54.350 --> 09:56.060
Who's in charge here?

09:56.060 --> 09:57.060
Michael?

09:57.060 --> 09:58.190
Nyla?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.900
I heard you were back on patrol,
but I didn't believe it.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.400
Okay, can we do
this reunion thing

10:03.400 --> 10:06.350
after you tell me why
you just landed in my operation?

10:06.350 --> 10:09.310
Because you're about to
blow my operation.

10:09.310 --> 10:11.060
So I'm shutting you down.

10:18.860 --> 10:20.530
Nine minutes, Lang?

10:20.530 --> 10:22.740
You guys are usually
much faster than that.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.650
Bradford's your TO?

10:26.650 --> 10:28.650
Yeah.
My condolences.

10:28.650 --> 10:30.280
That's what everyone says.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.070
Emmett.

10:31.070 --> 10:33.200
Lucy.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.400
All this over a few boxes
of Marsh Yellows?

10:35.400 --> 10:37.280
Right?
They couldn't get Pim-Pams?

10:37.280 --> 10:38.200
Who made the tourniquet?

10:38.200 --> 10:39.440
I did!

10:39.440 --> 10:41.070
Officer Lucy helped.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.820
Well, excellent work!

10:42.820 --> 10:44.200
Thank you.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.280
Uh...help.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.900
Oh. Right.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.900
In early September,
our sources in Mexico

10:52.900 --> 10:54.360
identified
a shipment of fentanyl

10:54.360 --> 10:56.490
being driven from Michoacán

10:56.490 --> 10:58.400
across the border
into California.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.110
Rather than stopping it,
we decided to follow the drugs,

11:01.110 --> 11:02.900
use the intel we collected

11:02.900 --> 11:04.860
to arrest
the entire smuggling network.

11:04.860 --> 11:07.110
A controlled delivery. That's
what you used to do undercover.

11:07.110 --> 11:09.570
Yes, Agent Banks and I
worked together on them

11:09.570 --> 11:11.240
on the Narcotics Task Force.

11:11.240 --> 11:14.360
Nyla was the most hardcore UC
I've ever seen.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.530
She could lie to God Himself
and get away with it.

11:16.530 --> 11:18.200
You don't say.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.740
That's surprising, 'cause
she always tells me the truth.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.150
Right, Detective?
Absolutely, sir.

11:22.150 --> 11:24.700
The truck was ambushed in
the desert outside Ocotillo.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.360
We were monitoring
with satellites.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.940
Seven minutes later,
the entire shipment was gone.

11:28.940 --> 11:30.280
And you think
Ripper stole it.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.530
We don't think it.

11:31.530 --> 11:32.860
We know it.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.240
So, why'd you shut us down?

11:35.240 --> 11:36.740
'Cause the drugs
aren't stored

11:36.740 --> 11:38.530
at the location
that you were about to hit.

11:38.530 --> 11:39.530
Where are they?

11:41.860 --> 11:44.490
You don't know, which is why
you're talking to us right now.

11:44.490 --> 11:46.780
We've been on Ripper
and his crew for two weeks.

11:46.780 --> 11:48.110
They haven't gone
near the fentanyl.

11:48.110 --> 11:49.490
So, what kind of weight
are we talking?

11:49.490 --> 11:50.940
20 kilos, uncut.

11:50.940 --> 11:53.490
Street value --
roughly $10 million.

11:53.490 --> 11:56.360
That is a morgue full of ODs
in the making.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.110
So, what's the plan
to keep it off the street?

11:58.110 --> 11:59.400
Honestly,
we didn't have one,

11:59.400 --> 12:01.320
till we got wind
of your warrant.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.240
You've given us a way in --
your CI.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.700
We can use her to introduce me
as a straw buyer to Ripper.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.200
Uh, all due respect, sir,

12:09.200 --> 12:10.940
I-I don't think
Bianca's ready for that.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.490
Then you can make her ready.

12:12.490 --> 12:14.400
Every hour that goes by
increases the risk

12:14.400 --> 12:15.940
that those drugs
end up on the street.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.200
Detective Calderon.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.940
We're done
with the canvass.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.030
Neighbors report seeing
a suspicious vehicle

12:24.030 --> 12:25.740
speeding down the street
around 11:00 a.m.

12:25.740 --> 12:27.700
Now, the guy on the corner
identified it as a blue sedan.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.280
Said he's never seen it
in the neighborhood before.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.610
And...?

12:30.610 --> 12:31.740
And the timeline
fits the TOD.

12:31.740 --> 12:33.570
Plus, it's a cul-de-sac.

12:33.570 --> 12:35.320
They don't get a lot of random
traffic driving through here.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.200
That's weak,
Officer Lopez,

12:37.200 --> 12:39.150
even if we didn't already
have a prime suspect.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.990
The husband?

12:40.990 --> 12:43.570
Patrol has responded to
six domestics at this residence

12:43.570 --> 12:45.360
over the past three years.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.860
Then there's the withdrawal slip
I found in the victim's purse.

12:47.860 --> 12:51.240
Mrs. Cook took $100,000 in cash
from their account

12:51.240 --> 12:52.610
first thing this morning.

12:52.610 --> 12:54.320
My guess is
she was getting ready

12:54.320 --> 12:55.940
to leave her abusive husband,
but he found out,

12:55.940 --> 12:57.650
stopped her in her tracks
permanently.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.200
Where's the money?
Don't know yet.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.030
Husband might have hid it,
or the victim did

13:01.030 --> 13:02.860
before she came home
to get the rest of her stuff.

13:02.860 --> 13:04.490
Either way,
we're done here.

13:04.490 --> 13:06.700
I still think
we should follow up on the car.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.360
Are you the detective here,
Officer Lopez?

13:09.360 --> 13:11.570
No, ma'am.
If I need more scut work,
I'll call you.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.030
You sure you're up for this?
Yeah.

13:16.030 --> 13:17.440
Okay, this isn't
just a handoff, Bianca.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.150
You have to look Ripper
in the eye

13:19.150 --> 13:20.990
and make him believe
you have a buyer for the drugs.

13:20.990 --> 13:22.400
I know. I can do it.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.240
Okay. Prove it.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.490
Sell me.

13:25.490 --> 13:26.240
What?

13:26.240 --> 13:27.780
Now.

13:27.780 --> 13:29.940
Okay.

13:29.940 --> 13:32.440
H-Hey, Ripper. I heard
you scored some fentanyl.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.610
Heard from where?

13:33.610 --> 13:35.320
You know.
No, I don't know.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.320
People.

13:37.320 --> 13:40.070
Anyway, I got you a buyer
out of Chicago.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.360
Kansas City, not Chicago.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.860
What difference
does it make?

13:42.860 --> 13:46.110
Because Kansas City is where
the DEA set up the fake buyer.

13:47.650 --> 13:48.860
I'm sorry.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.280
I'll do better.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.860
I promise
I won't let you down.

13:54.860 --> 13:56.530
Okay, this isn't about me,
Bianca.

13:56.530 --> 13:59.440
One wrong word,
and Ripper will kill you.

14:02.490 --> 14:04.700
I love how much
you care about me.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.030
Stay here.

14:10.030 --> 14:11.360
David, will you watch her
for a minute?

14:11.360 --> 14:12.570
Thank you.

14:12.570 --> 14:14.320
Excuse me, sir.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.740
Do you have a minute?

14:15.740 --> 14:17.700
Sure. Everything good to go
with your CI?

14:17.700 --> 14:19.940
Uh...actually, no.

14:19.940 --> 14:22.530
Bianca's a mess. I think Ripper
will see right through her.

14:22.530 --> 14:24.280
You tell Agent Banks?

14:24.280 --> 14:25.650
Not yet,
but there's more.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.610
Um...uh...

14:27.610 --> 14:30.400
it's become clear to me
that, uh, Bianca feels

14:30.400 --> 14:32.400
that the concern
I've shown for her

14:32.400 --> 14:34.780
means that
I have feelings for her.

14:34.780 --> 14:36.990
Yeah, yeah,
that is a problem.

14:36.990 --> 14:38.940
And I've tried to maintain
boundaries, but it's...

14:38.940 --> 14:40.200
apparent I've failed.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.110
No, no, no.
It's not your fault.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.940
CIs, by definition,
are in crisis.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.900
They've endured
a series of hardships

14:46.900 --> 14:50.150
and made a lot of bad choices
to end up in this station.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.320
Then we come along
and help them back up,

14:52.320 --> 14:54.360
giving them
the first sympathetic ear

14:54.360 --> 14:56.400
that some of them
have ever had.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.820
If you think Bianca's
unprepared, you got to pull her.

14:58.820 --> 15:00.240
I can do that?

15:00.240 --> 15:02.110
She's your CI,
which means it's your call,

15:02.110 --> 15:03.400
even as a rookie.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.070
But know this --

15:05.070 --> 15:07.820
Agent Banks will be pissed.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.740
Agent Banks?

15:13.740 --> 15:15.530
Good.
Let's wire her up.

15:15.530 --> 15:16.780
She's not up for this.

15:16.780 --> 15:18.110
Yes, I am.

15:18.110 --> 15:20.030
No. You're not.

15:20.030 --> 15:21.740
As Bianca's handler,
it's my decision

15:21.740 --> 15:23.490
whether to put her
in harm's way,

15:23.490 --> 15:26.280
and I can't allow her
to proceed with this operation.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.280
You can't?

15:28.280 --> 15:31.530
I make one phone call, you'll
never put on that uniform again.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.200
So wire her ass up.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.940
No, sir.

15:34.940 --> 15:36.700
And If you pull your head
out of your ass for a minute,

15:36.700 --> 15:38.030
you'll see that I'm right.

15:38.030 --> 15:40.490
If Ripper thinks for one second
this is a setup,

15:40.490 --> 15:42.530
you'll lose your only chance
to intercept those drugs,

15:42.530 --> 15:45.650
and the ODs that will follow --
those will be on your head.

15:51.490 --> 15:53.280
Get her out of here.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.650
Let's go.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.070
Why are you
sending me away?

16:00.070 --> 16:01.650
Because you're confused
about things.

16:01.650 --> 16:03.700
No, I want to help you!
Stop.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.570
I'm your handler,
not your friend.

16:07.570 --> 16:09.400
Then why did you
take me to NA?

16:10.940 --> 16:12.320
Help me find a job?

16:12.320 --> 16:15.900
That's what cops do
with their CIs, alright?

16:15.900 --> 16:18.320
We show a little kindness
to help keep you in line.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.200
Now, I should've been clearer
about that. That's on me.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.070
But you need to get the idea
out of your head

16:22.070 --> 16:23.780
that I have feelings
for you.

16:36.650 --> 16:39.320
Thank you so much.
I'll give these to the nurses.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.400
Oh, she got you good.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.610
Yeah,
that Emily kid's a hustler.
Uh-huh.

16:44.610 --> 16:46.820
I'm handing them out to
my favorite nurses so I
don't have to eat them all.

16:46.820 --> 16:48.780
Oh, man, I do not have
that kind of will power.

16:48.780 --> 16:51.030
I'm gonna eat three boxes
while I binge-watch
"Action Heist" tonight.

16:51.030 --> 16:52.030
Whoa, hold on.
You watch that?

16:52.030 --> 16:52.820
Yes.

16:52.820 --> 16:54.570
Man, I love that show!

16:54.570 --> 16:57.030
The second Harry showed up with
that mustache, I knew he was --

16:57.030 --> 16:59.240
He was the evil twin!
Yes!

16:59.240 --> 17:01.820
Yeah, mustache equals evil.
That's Bad Guy 101.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.200
Exactly.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.940
Yeah.
Good work.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.440
Well...

17:06.440 --> 17:08.109
if you like action and heists,
there happens to be

17:08.109 --> 17:10.150
a Rupert Payne marathon
at the Aero.

17:10.150 --> 17:12.530
And I have an extra ticket
for Saturday night,

17:12.530 --> 17:14.569
if you wanna...
come with me.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.280
Cool.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.530
Um...

17:19.990 --> 17:22.530
Actually, Saturday
is bad for me.

17:22.530 --> 17:24.319
But, uh...

17:24.319 --> 17:25.700
thank you for asking.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.030
Of course.

17:27.030 --> 17:28.650
Let's hit it, Boot.

17:28.650 --> 17:30.030
Later, Lang.
Alright, Bradford.

17:30.030 --> 17:31.570
Lucy.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.110
He seems nice.

17:39.110 --> 17:40.200
Sure.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.820
Do you know him well?

17:41.820 --> 17:43.780
Play a little
pick-up basketball together.

17:43.780 --> 17:45.150
Oh.

17:46.740 --> 17:48.400
No.
What?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.650
No. Forget it.
What?!

17:49.650 --> 17:51.610
Your social life
is not my responsibility.

17:51.610 --> 17:53.200
I learned that lesson
the hard way.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.610
You wanna vet Emmett,
you go to somebody else.

17:55.610 --> 17:56.860
It was the right call.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.110
I know.

17:58.110 --> 18:02.280
But since your boot
pulled the plug on my way in...

18:02.280 --> 18:03.940
we're gonna need
a new one.

18:03.940 --> 18:05.900
Uh, I don't have any CIs
that fit the bill,

18:05.900 --> 18:08.610
but I can ask Narcotics.

18:08.610 --> 18:10.070
We don't have time
for that.

18:10.070 --> 18:11.990
Ripper could flip the shipment
this afternoon.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.030
I need someone
that Ripper knows --

18:14.030 --> 18:16.320
someone who can
lie to God Himself.

18:17.610 --> 18:19.110
Mike.
Come on.

18:19.110 --> 18:20.530
Mi--

18:20.530 --> 18:23.070
You saved my ass before.

18:23.070 --> 18:25.440
I wouldn't ask
if lives weren't at stake.

18:26.990 --> 18:29.360
This isn't months undercover.
It's a quick in-and-out.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.070
Look, even if
I were to say yes,

18:31.070 --> 18:33.400
Ripper knows Crystal
as a junkie.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.110
There's no way he would trust me
to act as a go-between.

18:36.110 --> 18:37.900
True.

18:37.900 --> 18:41.440
You'd need someone to pose as
a link to the Kansas City buyer.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.860
Ideally, Ripper
would already know them.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.440
Nolan!

18:50.490 --> 18:51.900
What's up?

18:51.900 --> 18:53.490
We've got a new plan
to get Ripper.

18:53.490 --> 18:54.700
I'm going in as Crystal.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.240
And you're coming with me.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.280
What are you doing?

19:04.280 --> 19:05.940
I ran that blue car
through the CGIC

19:05.940 --> 19:07.110
and got a bunch of hits.

19:07.110 --> 19:08.110
Look at this.

19:08.110 --> 19:09.200
Lopez.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.860
I hear you've been pulling
robbery files?

19:13.860 --> 19:15.400
Yes, ma'am.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.200
Even though I told you
to stand down.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.940
Yes, ma'am.

19:19.940 --> 19:22.700
Here's the thing,
Nancy Drew.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.990
Your little hunch,
the files you pulled,

19:24.990 --> 19:27.110
the notes you're writing --
all of that is discoverable.

19:27.110 --> 19:29.320
I know you're sleeping
with the enemy,

19:29.320 --> 19:31.570
but I didn't think
you'd be one of them yourself.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.530
Sleeping with the enemy?

19:33.530 --> 19:34.990
This is about Wesley?

19:34.990 --> 19:36.110
Joanna Kelly.

19:36.110 --> 19:38.820
Murdered coming home from school
back in '18.

19:38.820 --> 19:41.440
Took us months for us to crack,
but we had him cold.

19:41.440 --> 19:44.400
And then your boyfriend gets it
tossed on some procedural crap.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.820
If you'd done the work
to make the case bulletproof,

19:45.820 --> 19:47.110
he wouldn't have
been able to.

19:47.110 --> 19:48.610
What did you say?
You heard me.

19:48.610 --> 19:50.610
Hey! Hey!
Let's call it a night, yeah?

19:50.610 --> 19:52.200
Listen to your boot.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.030
There were
three other burglaries

19:56.030 --> 19:58.440
in the same vicinity
as this murder.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.530
At all of them, a blue sedan
was seen leaving the scene.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.280
That's thin.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.280
Except that each victim also
withdrew a large sum of cash

20:04.280 --> 20:06.240
from the same bank
the same day they were robbed.

20:07.490 --> 20:09.030
It's all in here.

20:09.030 --> 20:11.820
So, unless you want to get
embarrassed on the stand again,

20:11.820 --> 20:13.440
you should take a look,
Detective.

20:30.030 --> 20:31.740
Well.

20:31.740 --> 20:32.990
Look who it is.

20:35.780 --> 20:37.070
Nice place.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.900
Crown jewel
of my empire.

20:38.900 --> 20:40.280
How's the food?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.570
Oh, it's great, especially
if you hate your colon.

20:42.570 --> 20:43.780
Yeah.

20:43.780 --> 20:45.490
But, uh, bet you got
one of those Michigan stars

20:45.490 --> 20:46.820
for laundering money,
am I right?

20:46.820 --> 20:48.200
Yeah.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.110
You know,
I was surprised you called.

20:50.110 --> 20:51.900
Especially after the way
we left it, you know?

20:51.900 --> 20:54.740
Yeah, no, I get that,
but, um

20:54.740 --> 20:56.650
money trumps a grudge
any day.

20:56.650 --> 20:58.150
Hmm.
And, uh...

20:58.150 --> 21:01.820
I got a deal that's gonna
make us both a lot of it.

21:01.820 --> 21:03.900
I don't do deals
with tweakers.

21:03.900 --> 21:06.740
I wouldn't, either.
But that ain't me no more.

21:06.740 --> 21:08.030
Mm.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.650
You see, my old man,
he got me clean.

21:09.650 --> 21:11.400
So now
I'm on the supply side.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.610
So, what, you, uh --
you want a job?

21:14.610 --> 21:15.990
Nah.

21:15.990 --> 21:17.320
Huh.

21:19.150 --> 21:22.030
I heard you came across
a big-time load of fentanyl.

21:25.860 --> 21:27.110
You heard?

21:30.280 --> 21:31.700
Right.

21:35.490 --> 21:36.610
Who told you that?

21:38.200 --> 21:39.530
Dude.

21:40.940 --> 21:42.360
It's all over the street.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.530
Hmm.

21:43.530 --> 21:44.990
But today
is your lucky day.

21:44.990 --> 21:46.030
Hmm.

21:46.030 --> 21:48.150
Because I got a buyer
for it all.

21:48.150 --> 21:52.070
Mm-hmm. A heavy hitter
outta Kansas City.

21:52.070 --> 21:53.400
Kansas City.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.530
Yeah.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.400
And who's this heavy hitter?
Hmm?

21:56.400 --> 21:58.030
He's my old man's cousin.
Hmm.

21:58.030 --> 22:00.490
They grew up together.
They did time together.

22:00.490 --> 22:01.900
But, yo, he is solid,

22:01.900 --> 22:05.110
and he is eager to
buy everything you have got.

22:05.110 --> 22:06.740
He's eager?

22:06.740 --> 22:08.700
Ohh.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.940
I'll pass.

22:11.940 --> 22:12.940
Throw her out.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.110
Don't be an idiot, yo!
Let's go.

22:14.110 --> 22:16.360
Y-You bit off way more
than you can chew --

22:16.360 --> 22:17.940
ripping off
a damn cartel?!

22:21.320 --> 22:22.530
You trying to move weight

22:22.530 --> 22:25.150
you ain't even got the manpower
to step on.

22:25.150 --> 22:27.070
I am trying to put millions
in your pocket

22:27.070 --> 22:29.490
and your problems
in your rearview.

22:29.490 --> 22:31.070
But you know what?

22:31.070 --> 22:33.150
Nah, you right.
Throw my ass out.

22:33.150 --> 22:35.400
How do I know
you're for real? Huh?

22:38.940 --> 22:41.240
Let's go meet my old man
in the back.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.700
Just you.

22:45.070 --> 22:46.240
Just me?

22:46.240 --> 22:48.530
Mm-hmm.

22:50.940 --> 22:52.150
Okay.

22:54.650 --> 22:56.240
After you.

23:07.860 --> 23:10.150
You expect me to believe
you got millions,

23:10.150 --> 23:12.150
driving around
in this low-rent ride?

23:12.150 --> 23:13.780
I thought you told me
he was smart.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.200
What's that mean?

23:17.200 --> 23:19.820
You wanna be a cop magnet?
Drive around in a flashy car.

23:19.820 --> 23:22.780
You learn that in KC?
Working corners in Brookside?

23:22.780 --> 23:24.990
I look like a Brookside guy
to you? I'm from Blue Parkway.

23:24.990 --> 23:26.700
And before you start
quizzing me on ribs,

23:26.700 --> 23:27.900
it's LC's all the way.

23:29.150 --> 23:30.150
Alright.

23:30.150 --> 23:31.740
Just had to check.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.570
Okay, so,
can we talk numbers now?

23:33.570 --> 23:35.780
20 keys uncut.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.570
Selling at 400 per.

23:37.570 --> 23:38.780
Hell no.

23:38.780 --> 23:40.650
Nah, 250.

23:40.650 --> 23:43.110
We're buying your entire load,
so we ain't paying retail.

23:43.110 --> 23:44.530
300.

23:44.530 --> 23:46.320
Best and final.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.280
That's a million,
just to prove we're for real.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.320
Alright.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.940
Careful.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.150
Relax, KC.
It's a sample.

24:03.150 --> 24:06.320
But cut that at least five times
before you taste it,

24:06.320 --> 24:08.650
or whoever does will be dead
before they hit the floor.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.070
So, it's a deal.
Maybe.

24:12.070 --> 24:13.400
We still got to do
a little background check

24:13.400 --> 24:14.780
on your man here.

24:14.780 --> 24:15.700
Alright.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.440
Well, you got my number.

24:17.440 --> 24:20.030
But you make us wait too long,
it goes back to 250.

24:25.110 --> 24:26.700
Is this gonna work?

24:26.700 --> 24:28.530
If Banks doesn't screw up
your paper trail.

24:28.530 --> 24:29.820
And if he does?

24:29.820 --> 24:31.440
We pray the body count
doesn't include us.

24:34.860 --> 24:36.200
Hey.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.280
Um, so,
I texted Sterling.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.440
We are going to
binge-watch "The Bachelor"

24:40.440 --> 24:42.320
and eat
all of these cookies.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.650
Yeah, Lucy, look --

24:43.650 --> 24:45.490
No, please. I cannot watch
"The Cardinal" again.

24:45.490 --> 24:46.860
It is so boring.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.110
"A" --
It is subtle and nuanced.

24:49.110 --> 24:50.280
Mm...
But, "B" --

24:50.280 --> 24:53.440
Look, it's not even
about what we watch.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.030
Okay.

24:55.030 --> 24:57.940
Sterling and I
love hanging out with you,

24:57.940 --> 25:02.030
but we really need
our alone time, too.

25:02.030 --> 25:04.820
Oh, my God.
I am the third wheel.

25:04.820 --> 25:07.320
Uh, beautiful, talented,
badass third wheel.

25:07.320 --> 25:08.400
I --

25:08.400 --> 25:09.900
Chen.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.700
Grey needs another team
on the DEA op.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.150
You wanna put in
some OT?

25:13.150 --> 25:14.990
Sure. Yeah.
I'm not doing anything.

25:14.990 --> 25:16.320
I'll go get changed.
Alright, let's go.

25:16.320 --> 25:17.900
Hey, Lucy.

25:17.900 --> 25:18.990
We're okay, right?

25:18.990 --> 25:20.240
Yeah. Yeah.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.940
Why wouldn't we be?

25:31.320 --> 25:32.820
Now what?

25:32.820 --> 25:35.030
I went through the file --
all the evidence you gathered.

25:35.030 --> 25:36.740
And it only took
two phone calls

25:36.740 --> 25:38.400
to ID the bank teller

25:38.400 --> 25:40.780
who handled
all the cash withdrawals

25:40.780 --> 25:42.530
for Mrs. Cook
and the other victims.

25:43.990 --> 25:47.070
Which means
you were right.

25:47.070 --> 25:48.860
And I owe you an apology.

25:48.860 --> 25:50.030
Yeah, you do.

25:50.030 --> 25:52.110
You're not gonna be gracious
about this, are you?

25:52.110 --> 25:53.280
Why should I be?
You were out of line.

25:53.280 --> 25:54.360
Fair enough.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.490
But there is a teller
in interrogation.

25:57.490 --> 25:58.900
You think
you got what it takes

25:58.900 --> 26:00.070
to get a confession
out of this guy?

26:04.860 --> 26:05.940
Watch me.

26:07.990 --> 26:10.200
Oh!

26:10.200 --> 26:12.150
Finally, someone's gonna
tell me what I'm doing here.

26:12.150 --> 26:13.860
Sorry to keep you,
Mr. Dugan.

26:13.860 --> 26:15.530
We just need your help
with a case we're investigating.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.240
Yeah. Of course.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.400
It's just, you know,
I have someplace to be, so...

26:19.400 --> 26:21.900
I'll try
and move things along.
Great.

26:21.900 --> 26:24.200
Do any of these people
look familiar?

26:24.200 --> 26:25.440
Nope.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.780
They're all customers
at your bank.

26:27.780 --> 26:29.610
Okay.
If you say so.

26:29.610 --> 26:31.570
In fact, they all made
large withdrawals

26:31.570 --> 26:33.860
and got robbed
later that same day.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.280
I'm sorry.
W-W-What does this
have to do with me?

26:36.280 --> 26:38.650
I was just hoping
you might have some insight

26:38.650 --> 26:40.070
on your fellow employees.

26:40.070 --> 26:41.280
Oh.

26:41.280 --> 26:42.900
Are any of them
having financial problems?

26:42.900 --> 26:44.700
Uh, Candice is always
stressed about money.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.070
She's moving back in
with her mom.

26:46.070 --> 26:47.860
And Roy drinks. A lot.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.110
What kind of car
do you drive?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.200
What? My car? A Honda.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.280
What color?

26:54.280 --> 26:57.110
I'm sorry,
but I do have to go.

26:57.110 --> 26:59.530
It's --
One last thing.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.320
I understand that you waited on
Mrs. Cook this morning.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.740
That isn't Mrs. Coo--

27:04.780 --> 27:06.400
So, you do know
the victims.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.700
No.

27:07.700 --> 27:10.110
U-Uh, I mean...y-yes.
I-I-I --

27:10.110 --> 27:12.570
Maybe you should sit down,
Mr. Dugan.

27:12.570 --> 27:14.530
I was at the crime scene.

27:14.530 --> 27:18.700
It's clear Mrs. Cook fought back
before she was killed.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.780
Are we gonna find marks
under your sleeves?

27:24.530 --> 27:26.360
Can I give you
a little advice, Mr. Dugan?

27:26.360 --> 27:27.610
Sure.

27:27.610 --> 27:29.320
You'll feel better
when you confess.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.030
I have nothing
to confess to.

27:31.030 --> 27:32.240
Okay.

27:33.530 --> 27:34.700
Listen to me.

27:36.030 --> 27:39.070
All that stress and fear
you're feeling --

27:39.070 --> 27:40.490
the overwhelming
need to vomit --

27:40.490 --> 27:42.820
that's never gonna go away
until you tell the truth.

27:42.820 --> 27:44.240
So, tell me...

27:45.900 --> 27:47.740
...did you mean
to kill her?

27:51.490 --> 27:53.940
It was an accident.

27:55.530 --> 27:57.610
She surprised me.

27:57.610 --> 28:00.030
And -- And -- And I-I --
I didn't want to --

28:00.030 --> 28:03.440
I need you to write that all
down, exactly how it happened.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.400
Why hasn't Ripper called
to confirm the meeting yet?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.030
He's doing his homework,

28:15.030 --> 28:16.940
making sure
the story checks out.

28:16.940 --> 28:18.320
...got a lot
on the line here.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.820
I'll tell him
you said so.

28:19.820 --> 28:20.990
What if I blew it?

28:20.990 --> 28:21.860
Okay.

28:21.860 --> 28:23.700
You didn't.
Alright. Good.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.940
Speak of the devil.

28:27.110 --> 28:28.610
Ripper. What's up?

28:28.610 --> 28:30.280
Hey. You and your boys
check out.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.940
Tell me something
I don't know.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.940
Deal's on. Meet me behind
Rock N Roll Ralph's tomorrow.

28:33.940 --> 28:34.990
11:00 a.m.

28:34.990 --> 28:36.610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll be seeing you.

28:36.610 --> 28:38.110
See? Told you he'd call.

28:38.110 --> 28:39.570
Don't get excited yet,
Boot.

28:39.570 --> 28:41.240
We still have a long night
ahead of us,

28:41.240 --> 28:43.110
making sure that
he does not change his mind

28:43.110 --> 28:45.030
and sell the drugs
out from under us.

28:45.030 --> 28:47.400
You up for a coffee run,
Officer Nolan?

28:47.400 --> 28:49.030
Uh, yeah, sure.
Coffee?

28:49.030 --> 28:51.110
Wouldn't be a proper stakeout
without coffee.

28:51.110 --> 28:52.780
I'm on it.

28:52.780 --> 28:54.740
First round's on me.

28:54.740 --> 28:55.900
You bet.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.700
I mean, obviously,

29:02.700 --> 29:04.860
I've been using Jackson
and Sterling as a crutch.

29:04.860 --> 29:07.900
Together, they kind of make
the perfect boyfriend.

29:07.900 --> 29:09.650
More importantly,
they're safe, and --

29:09.650 --> 29:11.240
Who are you talking to?

29:11.240 --> 29:12.400
Rachel.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.780
Hey.

29:13.780 --> 29:15.780
Just going for a coffee run.
Can I get you guys anything?

29:15.780 --> 29:17.530
Uh, chai tea latte,
please.

29:17.530 --> 29:19.610
This is a stakeout.
He's not going to Starbucks.

29:19.610 --> 29:20.990
Two coffees. Black.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.610
I'll try to find you
some vanilla creamer.

29:23.700 --> 29:25.030
Rachel? I'm back.

29:25.030 --> 29:28.150
Yeah, I totally see
what they're saying,

29:28.150 --> 29:29.650
and -- and they're right.

29:29.650 --> 29:32.070
I don't know if I'm ready.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.150
It's --

29:33.150 --> 29:34.320
Oh.

29:38.070 --> 29:39.400
Hello?

29:39.400 --> 29:41.280
Hello?

29:41.280 --> 29:42.860
Rachel is
in a staff meeting,

29:42.860 --> 29:44.820
which means you are
talking to no one.

29:49.030 --> 29:50.610
Not no one.

29:50.610 --> 29:52.700
Me.

29:52.700 --> 29:55.070
I talk things out
to process them,

29:55.070 --> 29:56.820
and I knew you wouldn't do it
with me, so --

29:56.820 --> 29:57.940
Why would you even care
what I think?

29:57.940 --> 29:59.030
What?

29:59.030 --> 30:00.900
The last time I gave you
romantic advice,

30:00.900 --> 30:02.530
I-I pushed you
towards Caleb,

30:02.530 --> 30:05.780
and...you almost died.

30:05.780 --> 30:08.320
That's --
That's ridiculous.

30:09.570 --> 30:11.530
There was no reason
to suspect anything.

30:11.530 --> 30:13.150
What happened --

30:13.150 --> 30:15.110
What happened
wasn't your fault.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.530
W-Wasn't mine, either.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.900
Look, I-I wouldn't
ask your advice

30:21.900 --> 30:23.570
if I didn't
value your opinion.

30:27.650 --> 30:29.320
You can do better than Emmett.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.780
What?

30:30.780 --> 30:33.030
Why --
Why would you say that?

30:33.030 --> 30:34.940
He's a firefighter,
for God's sakes.

30:34.940 --> 30:37.990
I know! He's hot!
Okay, no. No.

30:37.990 --> 30:39.900
See, if you're gonna act
all contrarian, I am done
with this conversation.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.490
I'm not being
a contrarian.

30:42.490 --> 30:45.990
You know, I-I think you're
threatened by his hunkiness.

30:45.990 --> 30:48.030
Hunkiness?
Mm-hmm.

30:48.030 --> 30:48.990
That's not even a word.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.160
This is nice.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.870
Working together again.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.830
Reminds me
of the old days.

31:01.290 --> 31:03.250
Except back then,
I would be the one in the house

31:03.250 --> 31:05.040
with the target,
wearing the wire.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.040
I like this better.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.290
Having you close.

31:08.290 --> 31:10.490
Are you flirting
with me?

31:10.490 --> 31:11.540
No.

31:12.750 --> 31:16.410
I just think your talents
are being wasted back on patrol.

31:16.410 --> 31:17.620
Really?

31:17.620 --> 31:20.330
'Cause I got talents
you don't even know about.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.990
Now you're flirting
with me.

31:27.490 --> 31:30.330
So, tell me --

31:30.330 --> 31:31.580
why is it
we never hooked up?

31:33.540 --> 31:35.490
'Cause I was married.

31:35.490 --> 31:37.370
Yeah.

31:37.370 --> 31:39.370
Well, you're not married
anymore.

31:42.250 --> 31:43.870
Hot coffee is --

31:45.540 --> 31:47.080
You want me
to come back later?

31:47.080 --> 31:48.370
No. Give me
the damn coffee.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.750
Whoa.
We got a bogey.

31:51.750 --> 31:53.330
Neighbor?

31:53.330 --> 31:55.660
Seems nervous.
Keeps moving around.

31:55.660 --> 31:56.750
Could it be
one of Ripper's carriers?

31:56.750 --> 31:57.580
Doubt it.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.120
No backpack, no bag.

32:02.540 --> 32:04.080
It's Bianca.

32:07.370 --> 32:08.830
What the hell
is she doing here?

32:08.830 --> 32:10.040
Double-crossing us.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.410
That would be suicide.

32:11.410 --> 32:13.410
Ripper would know it was her
that gave him up.

32:13.410 --> 32:15.410
What was that quote
about a woman scorned?

32:15.410 --> 32:16.790
Uh, point to all units.

32:16.790 --> 32:18.410
Be advised a friendly just
walked into the target house.

32:18.410 --> 32:19.830
Repeat,
friendly is on scene.

32:19.830 --> 32:22.040
Can we get some audio
on this?

32:22.040 --> 32:23.790
What the hell do you want?

32:23.790 --> 32:25.200
The cops are onto you.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.580
Say that again?

32:26.580 --> 32:28.200
I said
the cops are onto you.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.660
How much do they know?

32:29.660 --> 32:31.660
I don't know.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.870
See anything?

32:40.870 --> 32:42.540
No. But that doesn't mean
they're not out there.

32:42.540 --> 32:44.330
We've been made.
We got to get in there.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.620
Negative.
We hold here.

32:45.620 --> 32:46.990
Ow! Let go of me!

32:46.990 --> 32:48.790
Screw that!

32:48.790 --> 32:50.620
Nolan's right.
He's gonna kill her.
You gave me up!

32:50.620 --> 32:51.830
He's not gonna kill her
in his house.

32:51.830 --> 32:53.450
If he thought
we were onto him,

32:53.450 --> 32:55.910
he'd create a distraction,
make a run for it.

33:00.660 --> 33:01.830
He's making a run
for it.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.290
Negative.
That's a decoy vehicle.

33:07.290 --> 33:09.490
He's looking to split
our resources and our perimeter.

33:09.490 --> 33:11.120
All units,
stay with the house.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.490
Prepare to make entry,
10 seconds.

33:13.490 --> 33:14.910
Decoy could be
going for the drugs.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.830
Bradford, Chen.

33:16.830 --> 33:19.790
Let the SUV get out of the area
and then stop that vehicle.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.700
7-Adam-19, suspect vehicle
spotted heading east on Midland.

33:22.700 --> 33:23.790
Pursuing.

33:40.450 --> 33:42.290
C-side perimeter, hold.

33:42.290 --> 33:44.120
All other units,
collapse on our location.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.330

Still clearing upstairs.

35:07.910 --> 35:09.870
Downstairs clear.
No Ripper. No Bianca.

35:09.870 --> 35:11.660
They're in
the decoy vehicle.

35:11.660 --> 35:14.990
7-Adam-19, be advised.
Ripper is in the decoy vehicle.

35:14.990 --> 35:18.080
I repeat,
he is in the decoy vehicle.

35:22.830 --> 35:24.990
Coming up on the vehicle
heading northeast on Beaudry,

35:24.990 --> 35:27.750
approaching
4th Street intersection.

Yeah, I think so.

36:05.230 --> 36:07.020
Harper, Bradford.

36:07.020 --> 36:08.890
Go to Harper.
Was Ripper in the SUV?

36:08.890 --> 36:11.150
Unknown. We got ambushed
by a second vehicle.

36:11.150 --> 36:12.310
Brown pickup truck.

36:12.310 --> 36:13.770
Both vehicles got away.

36:19.060 --> 36:20.520
Ripper's gonna head
straight for the fentanyl.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.060
He'll kill Bianca.

36:22.060 --> 36:23.560
I thought you ID'd
all of Ripper's crew.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.890
So, who was in
the intercept vehicle?
No idea.

36:25.890 --> 36:28.980
We've only been up on Ripper
since he hijacked the shipment.

36:28.980 --> 36:30.770
New guy must have been
laying low on purpose,

36:30.770 --> 36:32.520
staying close to the drugs.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.230
How could they
possibly coordinate an
intercept so quickly?

36:34.230 --> 36:35.600
Cellphone.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.150
We're up on
all of Ripper's phones.

36:37.150 --> 36:38.190
Not the burners.

36:40.770 --> 36:42.940
Looks like
he buys them in bulk.

36:42.940 --> 36:45.520
If we can find
the number Ripper used,
we can ping his location.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.150
It's the only empty box.
That's got to be the one.

36:47.150 --> 36:48.520
Call the phone carrier.

36:48.520 --> 36:49.940
Tell them
we have an in-progress,

36:49.940 --> 36:53.020
life-threatening,
exigent circumstance.

37:10.850 --> 37:12.560
Boss, I'm in bad shape.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.850
I think my leg's broken.

37:14.850 --> 37:16.690
You shouldn't have hit 'em
straight on.

37:16.690 --> 37:18.020
Now you're a problem
for me.

37:18.020 --> 37:18.890
No!

37:23.850 --> 37:26.350
I don't see Bianca.
We need to get in there.

37:26.350 --> 37:28.100
Not until we locate
the fentanyl.

37:52.310 --> 37:53.940
Boss.

37:53.940 --> 37:56.310
Boss!
Let's drop this chick
and get outta here.

37:56.310 --> 37:57.600
Go ahead.

38:04.020 --> 38:05.350
Police!

38:05.350 --> 38:07.270
Get those hands up!

38:12.150 --> 38:14.020
Crystal.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.690
You even twitch
towards that gun,

38:15.690 --> 38:17.390
and it'll be
the last thing you do.

38:17.390 --> 38:18.600
I knew you were all wrong.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.190
No, you didn't.

38:20.190 --> 38:21.440
Turn around!

38:28.440 --> 38:31.560
Thank God.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.020
I was so scared.

38:34.230 --> 38:35.730
Put your hands on the car.

38:38.230 --> 38:39.440
What are you doing?

38:39.440 --> 38:41.310
Arresting you.

38:41.310 --> 38:43.730
Wait. No.

38:43.730 --> 38:44.770
I screwed up.

38:44.770 --> 38:46.980
I was hurt, angry.

38:46.980 --> 38:49.440
Look, I just lost my mind.
I'm sorry.

38:49.440 --> 38:50.770
I am, too.

38:52.390 --> 38:53.850
Alright.

38:53.850 --> 38:55.850
We've gotta stop
meeting like this.

38:55.850 --> 38:57.980
That's not funny.

38:57.980 --> 38:58.850
Hi.

38:58.850 --> 39:00.060
It's a little funny.

39:00.060 --> 39:01.850
Let me see.

39:01.850 --> 39:03.810
It's not that deep.

39:03.810 --> 39:05.390
You got lucky.

39:07.020 --> 39:09.560
Um...

39:09.560 --> 39:11.480
Can I tell you
something?

39:11.480 --> 39:13.690
Well, I like to think that we
have that kind of relationship.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.560
I, uh...

39:18.560 --> 39:21.600
I lied about being busy
on Saturday.

39:21.600 --> 39:25.020
My social life is
kinda complicated right now.

39:25.020 --> 39:27.230
No worries.

39:27.230 --> 39:31.100
But just so that you know,
when it gets less complicated,

39:31.100 --> 39:32.770
I'll still be interested.

39:36.190 --> 39:37.520
Oh! Ow!

39:37.520 --> 39:39.480
Oh, don't be such a baby.
Come on.

39:39.480 --> 39:40.810
I'm not a baby!

39:40.810 --> 39:42.150
You're acting like it
right now.

39:42.150 --> 39:44.310
Okay,
watch how tough I am.

39:46.940 --> 39:48.230
Nice job tonight.

39:48.230 --> 39:49.270
Thanks.

39:49.270 --> 39:50.600
Hey.

39:50.600 --> 39:53.150
You ever thought about
becoming a detective?

39:53.150 --> 39:54.940
I took the exam
last year.

39:54.940 --> 39:56.650
Scored in the top three,

39:56.650 --> 39:59.890
but then I fell down on a case,
lost my luster.

39:59.890 --> 40:03.060
Well, I might be able
to smooth that over.

40:03.060 --> 40:05.190
Get you back on the fast track
if you want.

40:05.190 --> 40:06.310
Seriously?

40:06.310 --> 40:07.940
Yeah.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.940
Then I'd have to take back

40:09.940 --> 40:11.560
all the nasty things
I said about you.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.390
Yes, you would.

40:14.890 --> 40:16.150
I'll be in touch.

40:17.810 --> 40:21.730

40:21.730 --> 40:24.480
Hear me out.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.310
As a case officer.

40:26.310 --> 40:28.150
No more undercover.

40:28.150 --> 40:30.270
Company car,

40:30.270 --> 40:32.810
government plane
at your disposal 24-7.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.190
Any other, uh, perks?

40:37.190 --> 40:39.810
Well, you'd be
working closely with me.

40:39.810 --> 40:41.730
Hmm.

40:41.730 --> 40:44.190
That is tempting.

40:45.690 --> 40:46.770
I'm gonna have to say no.

40:48.850 --> 40:51.390
I just got my life
back on track.

40:51.390 --> 40:53.810
And that plane you're offering
also comes with

40:53.810 --> 40:57.480
3:00 a.m. phone calls
and 15-hour days, and...

40:59.060 --> 41:01.480
I'm happy, Mike.

41:01.480 --> 41:04.060
Happier than I've been
in a really long time.

41:04.060 --> 41:08.100
So, uh, I'm gonna say no
to the job.

41:10.020 --> 41:11.520
But I wouldn't say no
to dinner.

anything wrong.

41:50.150 --> 41:51.890
Yes, sir.

41:53.190 --> 41:56.150
I'm gonna do something
I never thought I would.

41:56.150 --> 41:58.100
I'm gonna buy you a beer.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.100
Sir. Wow.

42:01.350 --> 42:03.310
I'm touched
that you would even offer --

42:03.310 --> 42:05.190
You gonna make this weird?
'Cause I can take it back.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.690
No. I'm shutting up about it
right now.

42:07.690 --> 42:10.270
You want to grab a bite to eat,
too? Because there's --

42:10.270 --> 42:12.190
You know what? Just a beer.
That's fine. I'm busy, too.
