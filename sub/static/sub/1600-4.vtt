and was being forced
to work as a prostitute.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.484

it was real,

16:39.600 --> 16:41.090

Shelby was involved

16:41.160 --> 16:42.764

16:42.840 --> 16:44.126

in his basement.

go into Zack's house?

16:46.720 --> 16:47.801

16:48.600 --> 16:49.647
You told me to.

told you that.

16:52.760 --> 16:53.966
Yes, you did.
You sat on my bed,

16:54.040 --> 16:55.530

what I needed to do,

16:55.600 --> 16:56.806
that I needed to
get back the belt.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.050

That's not true.
It's true.

17:11.880 --> 17:15.327
I don't want you to worry, but
you've done this for a while.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.403

34:22.960 --> 34:24.085
Raped her.

34:25.239 --> 34:26.241
What?

34:28.520 --> 34:30.123
I was out.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.929
I came home and found
her in the kitchen,

34:32.000 --> 34:33.161
her clothes torn off,

34:33.440 --> 34:35.090
her head
pushed into the table.

34:37.360 --> 34:41.284
I picked up this doorstop and hit
him on the head, and he passed out.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.366
She... She was
bleeding real bad.

34:44.440 --> 34:47.364
She cut her arm, I guess, so I
ran to get the first-aid kit.

34:48.840 --> 34:51.844
When I came back in the
room, she was stabbing him.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.525
Not once, like 30 times.
She totally lost it.

34:56.679 --> 35:00.082
She didn't want to call the cops, even
though I told her that we should.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.531
I'm so scared, Dylan.

35:04.480 --> 35:07.404
Every minute I've lived here,
every second, just total fear.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.891
And that Sheriff's totally
suspicious of her, and...

35:12.120 --> 35:14.043
And it's my fault.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.285
I... I did this
really stupid thing.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.130
Keith Summers,
he was, uh...

35:20.200 --> 35:23.283
He was wearing this, like, police
belt when he attacked Mom,

35:23.360 --> 35:24.521
and I kept it.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.726
I hid it under my bed.
I don't know why.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.681
And, uh...

35:32.880 --> 35:35.850
And Shelby, when they searched
the house, he found it,

35:35.920 --> 35:37.524
and he's got it, and
he won't give it back,

35:37.600 --> 35:39.409
and now he's got
Mom doing stuff,

35:40.240 --> 35:41.480
'cause she's afraid,
I guess.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.882
That's why you
broke into his house?

35:44.440 --> 35:45.965
Was to get that?
Yeah.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.241
Yeah, well,
what I found there...

35:48.320 --> 35:50.482
Well, at least what I
thought I found there

35:50.560 --> 35:53.040
was this girl.
This Asian girl.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.570
He was keeping her
locked in the basement.

35:58.800 --> 35:59.926
I couldn't get her
out of there.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.207
I told her I'd come
back and get her out.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.531
I'm gonna help you.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.081
Thank you.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.040
Is that a girl?

36:17.440 --> 36:18.521
Is she pretty?

36:19.640 --> 36:20.801
You like her?

36:22.320 --> 36:24.049
Text her right now and tell
her you're coming over.

36:24.320 --> 36:26.322
I... I can't do that.
It just says, "Hey."

36:26.640 --> 36:28.768
Sure you can. What if she
doesn't want me to come over?

36:29.080 --> 36:31.287
Girls don't text you
at 10:00 at night

36:31.360 --> 36:32.964
because they don't want
you to come over.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.731
Go ahead. Trust me.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.008
I got laid when I was 12.
(CHUCKLES)

36:38.520 --> 36:41.126
Seriously, just text her.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.887
Oh, my... I can't
believe I just...

36:50.960 --> 36:52.724
I should never have
done that.

Come over."

Well, I can't go now.

Not with all the...
It's crazy.

thing that is not crazy.

Come on, leave!

to my room?

38:17.880 --> 38:19.120
Sedated.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.090
You can sit on the bed.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.248

helping me so much.

38:58.720 --> 38:59.767
Sure.

I'm just...

39:13.120 --> 39:14.770
Tired of being sad.

39:16.880 --> 39:19.770
I want to feel something
else for a little while.

No, I don't think
you're weird.

What the hell are you talking
about, "Out with a girl"?

41:13.720 --> 41:15.848
What girl?
He's with a girl, Norma.

41:16.760 --> 41:18.444
He's a 17-year-old kid,

41:18.520 --> 41:20.090
and he's out
with a girl he likes.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.003
And I hope to God
he's getting laid,

41:22.080 --> 41:23.366

hell deserves it

never say anything bad about me.

He said plenty.
What would he say?

Enough for him to be
taken away from you.

away from me.
