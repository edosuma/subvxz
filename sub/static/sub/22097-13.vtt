WEBVTT

00:02.838 --> 00:05.398
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:37.939 --> 00:39.463
Just do it.

00:41.710 --> 00:43.302
<i>Boomer, this could be it.</i>

00:43.378 --> 00:46.040
<i>This is the little planet that
solves all of our problems.</i>

00:46.114 --> 00:47.274
What did you see?

00:47.349 --> 00:50.113
A dome-like structure
with six roads leading out of it.

00:50.185 --> 00:52.619
This planet is Kobol.

00:52.821 --> 00:55.813
Organize a ground survey team.
Three Raptors.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.193
They're everywhere!
Get us out of here!

01:00.695 --> 01:04.563
We need a way to take out the base
ship before we can attempt a rescue.

01:04.699 --> 01:08.157
If you go back to Caprica
and bring me the arrow...

01:09.337 --> 01:10.929
I will show us the way.

01:11.273 --> 01:12.706
What are you doing, Starbuck?

01:13.008 --> 01:15.374
<i>Galactica. Apollo.
She just jumped away.</i>

01:15.443 --> 01:17.377
Where the hell did she go?

01:18.013 --> 01:19.002
Home.

01:30.692 --> 01:33.183
Over here. Now, come on.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.626
Now come on!

01:34.696 --> 01:36.755
Everybody up!

01:36.831 --> 01:38.799
Come on! Go!

01:39.334 --> 01:41.894
Come on, move! Out!

01:42.771 --> 01:44.762
Come on,
get him out of the chair.

01:44.839 --> 01:45.828
Drag him out.

01:46.341 --> 01:48.639
Look at me. I got him!

01:48.743 --> 01:50.938
For Gods' sakes, hurry! Come on!

01:51.012 --> 01:52.502
I got his legs.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.842
I got him!

01:53.915 --> 01:55.678
Try it on your shoulder.

01:57.953 --> 02:01.411
Doc! Come on, Doc!

02:01.489 --> 02:02.513
Crash!

02:02.590 --> 02:03.682
Doc!

02:15.036 --> 02:16.663
Take my hand.

02:19.174 --> 02:21.404
Gaius, take my hand.

02:36.725 --> 02:39.592
Hey, come on! Wake up!
Stay with me! We gotta go!

02:39.661 --> 02:41.151
Stay with me, Doc! Come on!

02:41.229 --> 02:43.823
Come on! Bring him
outside! It's gonna blow!

02:47.836 --> 02:49.201
Get down!

02:59.114 --> 03:00.741
Stay down.

03:01.149 --> 03:02.707
You okay?

03:04.252 --> 03:06.686
We got full tanks.
Let's see what we get.

03:06.755 --> 03:08.017
Getting them down.

03:13.595 --> 03:15.028
You all right? You okay?

03:15.096 --> 03:17.030
Get the supplies before
they burn up. Go.

03:17.098 --> 03:18.224
Right away.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.291
We crashed both tanks. The
gas is gone. It's all gone.

04:55.163 --> 04:56.790
It's a museum. So what?

04:58.166 --> 05:01.397
It's more than that. It's the
home of the arrow of Apollo.

05:02.036 --> 05:03.435
What the hell is that?

05:04.205 --> 05:05.604
You never liked history.

05:06.107 --> 05:10.305
Come on, Helo. It's supposed to be the
only clue as to the location of Earth.

05:10.645 --> 05:13.375
Earth? What are you
talking about?

05:13.781 --> 05:16.682
Who's going to Earth?
It doesn't even exist.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.412
<i>I'm trying to get back
to Galactica.</i>

05:20.388 --> 05:23.789
What I need from you is a way off
this planet, and a way back to my ship.

05:23.858 --> 05:25.758
If you don't do that,
I'll blow your head off.

05:25.827 --> 05:27.727
Why don't you just
shut up for a change?

05:28.062 --> 05:30.724
You're only alive because
I've kept you alive.

05:30.832 --> 05:33.323
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be dead by now.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.066
Whether you like it or not...

05:35.136 --> 05:37.161
I'm your only hope of
getting off this planet.

05:37.238 --> 05:39.706
If I were you, I'd take that
tough guy attitude of yours...

05:39.774 --> 05:40.934
and shove it up your ass.

05:44.679 --> 05:47.443
We can't move around the city
during daylight.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.745
So we hole up and
we wait till dark.

06:06.167 --> 06:07.657
Unbelievable.

06:08.169 --> 06:09.500
She's crossed
the line before...

06:09.571 --> 06:11.436
but this is so far
beyond the pale...

06:11.506 --> 06:14.634
She wouldn't have done this
on her own. She was coerced.

06:14.842 --> 06:18.437
No one coerces Starbuck.
Believe me, I've tried.

06:19.647 --> 06:23.083
Commander, I have
the President on the line.

06:23.985 --> 06:26.545
Bear witness.
Put on your headset.

06:32.227 --> 06:34.354
<i>Madam President, moments ago...</i>

06:34.429 --> 06:37.023
<i>Lt. Thrace
took the Cylon Raider...</i>

06:37.098 --> 06:39.828
<i>on an unscheduled and
unauthorized jump.</i>

06:39.901 --> 06:40.890
Yes.

06:41.603 --> 06:44.094
Do you have any knowledge
of this incident?

06:44.305 --> 06:47.900
Let's save some time here, Commander.
The question you really want to ask me...

06:47.976 --> 06:51.605
is whether or not I asked Lt.
Thrace to take the Raider to Caprica.

06:51.946 --> 06:54.141
<i>The answer to
your question is: yes.</i>

06:58.186 --> 07:00.177
You and I had talked
about this.

07:00.255 --> 07:01.586
Yes, we had.

07:01.656 --> 07:05.092
<i>We both decided
it was a military decision.</i>

07:06.961 --> 07:10.397
My responsibility as President
is first and foremost...

07:10.465 --> 07:13.593
to protect and preserve
this fleet and its future.

07:13.868 --> 07:17.565
<i>In the end, that outweighs any
other consideration. It has to.</i>

07:17.672 --> 07:19.435
By taking the Raider...

07:19.507 --> 07:23.341
you've placed our people on the
surface of Kobol in direct danger.

07:23.745 --> 07:27.909
I'm very aware of the danger our
men and women are in on Kobol.

07:27.982 --> 07:31.611
I am also deeply aware of the danger
this civilization will be in...

07:31.686 --> 07:34.746
if I ignore the pursuit
of this arrow.

07:41.729 --> 07:45.893
I'm going to have to ask you for
your resignation, Madam President.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.467
<i>No.</i>

07:48.903 --> 07:52.031
Then I'm terminating your
presidency as of this moment.

07:53.741 --> 07:58.371
Commander Adama, I will exercise
the authority of this office...

07:58.479 --> 07:59.946
until I am unable to do so.

08:00.014 --> 08:03.245
So if you want to
stage a coup...

08:03.384 --> 08:05.818
you're gonna have to come
over here and arrest me.

08:05.887 --> 08:07.855
I don't want any bloodshed.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.913
Of course you don't.
Neither do I.

08:09.991 --> 08:14.553
Neither does the press.
They're here, by the way.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.061
The press.

08:17.031 --> 08:18.726
They're recording
every minute.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.185
<i>Order the Cap to isolate
Colonial One.</i>

08:43.257 --> 08:44.349
Mr. Gaeta.
Sir.

08:44.425 --> 08:47.053
<i>Jam any transmissions in or
out of Colonial One immediately.</i>

08:47.128 --> 08:49.358
Yes, sir.
Prepare a strike team.

08:50.131 --> 08:52.258
As long as she's President,
she's dangerous.

08:52.333 --> 08:55.427
If she can turn Starbuck against
us, she's capable of anything.

08:55.503 --> 08:56.470
Yes, sir.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.663
She's bluffing.

08:57.739 --> 08:58.933
Well, let's hope so.

08:59.574 --> 09:02.099
There's also a Cylon base ship
out there to deal with.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.467
Leave that to me.

09:04.879 --> 09:07.074
This government survived
a Cylon attack.

09:07.148 --> 09:09.116
It will survive William Adama.

09:09.350 --> 09:11.011
I think he's bluffing.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.814
But just in case,
we need to be prepared.

09:16.057 --> 09:18.958
I know their security detail.
They will defend that ship.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.586
We'll have to take her down
compartment by compartment.

09:21.696 --> 09:23.129
Mr. Gaeta?
Sir.

09:23.197 --> 09:26.394
Am I correct in assuming that I
have two Cylon transponders left?

09:26.467 --> 09:29.300
Yes, sir. But only one of them
is fully functional.

09:29.370 --> 09:30.837
One will do.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.470
Now I need a pilot.

09:37.111 --> 09:39.579
Sir.
As you were.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.914
How are you feeling?

09:44.318 --> 09:46.183
It looks worse
than it is, sir.

09:47.355 --> 09:50.586
Things are moving very quickly
and I need every pilot.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.056
I'm ready, sir.

09:53.461 --> 09:55.361
I have a very special mission
for you...

09:55.430 --> 09:56.954
and I won't kid around.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.158
It's high risk,
extremely high risk.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.560
I understand.

10:00.635 --> 10:04.571
I need you to light-jump to Kobol
and take care of this base star.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.139
We're placing a Cylon
transponder aboard your Raptor.

10:09.277 --> 10:14.112
In theory, it should allow you to approach
the base star without getting fired upon.

10:14.215 --> 10:18.743
<i>But we'll still be ID'd as Colonial
Raptors once we're in visual range.</i>

10:18.820 --> 10:21.789
For all they know, you
could be two Cylon agents...

10:21.856 --> 10:24.256
returning with
a captured Raptor.

10:25.126 --> 10:28.095
Once you're inside
the defense perimeter...

10:28.463 --> 10:31.660
I need you to make them think
you want to dock.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.502
You have to fire your nuke
into the loading bay...

10:37.638 --> 10:41.130
and then jump back home
immediately. Do you understand?

10:41.943 --> 10:43.274
I understand.

10:44.278 --> 10:46.678
I can do it, sir.
I know I can.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.605
You have to.

10:52.954 --> 10:54.251
Yes, sir.

11:29.624 --> 11:31.649
This doesn't look good.

11:32.026 --> 11:34.756
Please tell me this was
not all for nothing.

11:46.340 --> 11:47.807
I'm good.

11:48.943 --> 11:50.604
I am really good.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.408
I'm home.

11:57.285 --> 11:58.809
Wow, I'm home.

12:09.530 --> 12:14.126
Gaeta, please tell me that you're
right about this transponder thing.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.194
Stop. Stop that.

12:48.735 --> 12:49.929
I'm nervous.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.840
Like anything scares you.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.842
Things scare me, Helo.
I have feelings.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.878
You have software.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.179
I don't know if you can
hear this or not, Helo...

13:04.251 --> 13:07.277
but what we had between us
was important.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.251
It was very important.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.218
Why?

13:12.693 --> 13:15.059
Because it was the next step.

13:15.129 --> 13:17.290
Because it brings us
closer to God.

13:17.498 --> 13:19.557
Don't mock the Gods.
It's a human belief.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.225
I'm human.
They're our gods.

13:22.736 --> 13:27.571
But beyond that, I just want you to know
that I genuinely feel something for you.

13:33.347 --> 13:34.837
I don't care.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.480
I don't love you.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.387
I loved what I thought
was you.

13:44.858 --> 13:48.225
Helo, I think there's something
else that you should know.

13:50.397 --> 13:51.989
I'm pregnant.

13:58.972 --> 14:02.806
<i>Galactica, Apollo. We
have visual ID on Colonial One.</i>

14:04.178 --> 14:06.646
Tell Apollo he's cleared
to begin the assault...

14:06.713 --> 14:09.443
to contact us when
he has soft-seal on the hull.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.349
Aye, sir.

14:12.486 --> 14:16.752
Commander, Boomer and Racetrack are in
the air, ready for their jump to Kobol.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.020
Put them through down here.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.624
<i>Boomer, Galactica Actual.</i>

14:27.201 --> 14:29.761
<i>I just wanted to say
good luck, good hunting...</i>

14:29.836 --> 14:31.929
<i>and I have complete faith
in the both of you.</i>

14:32.005 --> 14:34.872
<i>Thank you, Actual.
We won't let you down.</i>

14:35.809 --> 14:38.243
<i>Racetrack,
start the jump clock.</i>

14:41.348 --> 14:42.610
<i>Clock is running.</i>

14:49.656 --> 14:52.147
<i>Galactica.
Apollo. We have soft-seal.</i>

14:53.026 --> 14:55.494
I know Commander Adama and
I'm counting on the fact...

14:55.562 --> 14:58.030
that when push comes to shove,
he is the kind of man...

14:58.098 --> 15:00.089
who will not want bloodshed.

15:01.335 --> 15:04.702
Nevertheless, this may not be
the safest place.

15:05.339 --> 15:08.467
Billy, how many civilians
are in the cargo hold?

15:08.642 --> 15:10.166
176.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.209
There is room in the cargo
hold and I implore you...

15:13.280 --> 15:14.611
to find refuge there...

15:14.681 --> 15:17.673
with the other civilians.
This is my choice.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.314
This is my choice.

15:22.456 --> 15:24.356
You do not have to
come with me.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.016
We stand with our President.

15:35.869 --> 15:37.393
Yes?

15:40.240 --> 15:41.707
Right.

15:44.778 --> 15:49.044
Security commander reports sounds
of someone cutting through the hull.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.485
The Raptors are cutting
through the hull, sir.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.222
Get the President on the line.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.108
<i>You think this thing
is working?</i>

17:27.581 --> 17:29.481
<i>We're about to find out.</i>

17:50.404 --> 17:52.133
<i>I guess so.</i>

17:52.672 --> 17:53.798
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:08.088 --> 18:10.818
How are we doing on that?
It's not responding, sir.

18:10.891 --> 18:13.359
Are you even trained
to use this thing?

18:15.762 --> 18:18.094
How's he doing, Chief?

18:24.070 --> 18:26.834
Not doing so good. I don't now
if his lungs are burned or what.

18:26.907 --> 18:30.343
He's a tough kid.
He's gonna pull through.

18:31.044 --> 18:33.171
Get those wounds
looked at, Chief.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.441
Yeah. Lieutenant?

18:40.587 --> 18:42.817
Shouldn't we be moving out?

18:43.156 --> 18:45.215
You have a plan for
tactical deployment?

18:45.292 --> 18:47.260
Plan for tactical deployment,
Chief?

18:47.327 --> 18:51.696
Get to the high ground. It'll be our best
chance of being seen by a search party.

18:51.765 --> 18:55.292
High ground is also our best
chance of being seen by the Cylons.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.064
They're flying around, sir.
They might land the troops...

18:58.138 --> 19:00.106
before we get rescued.

19:02.042 --> 19:03.509
That's true.

19:03.577 --> 19:04.669
Yeah.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.302
Sir, if I may...

19:07.414 --> 19:10.850
suggest that we take cover
on the ground...

19:10.917 --> 19:12.885
maybe somewhere
we won't be seen from the air?

19:12.953 --> 19:15.319
Okay, yeah. Chief, that's...

19:16.957 --> 19:18.254
Carry on, Chief.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.115
<i>Launch the nuke
and prepare to jump.</i>

19:46.620 --> 19:47.848
<i>Frack.</i>

19:48.889 --> 19:50.083
<i>What?</i>

19:50.423 --> 19:53.085
<i>The bomb release is jammed.
I can't free it.</i>

20:07.474 --> 20:09.499
<i>We can dock inside the ship.</i>

20:10.443 --> 20:11.603
<i>Excuse me?</i>

20:12.012 --> 20:14.572
<i>They think we're Cylons.
They'll let us dock.</i>

20:15.415 --> 20:19.408
<i>We can release the bomb manually and
drop the nuke inside the ship itself.</i>

20:20.787 --> 20:22.948
<i>It'll work. I know it.
Oh, my Gods.</i>

20:44.844 --> 20:46.368
Petard, Felix?

20:47.047 --> 20:49.675
Can I get a hand up
here, please? Yes, sir.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.551
Cally, how's he doing?
Not good, sir.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.019
Get a blanket on him.
Keep him warm.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.946
How are you?

21:01.061 --> 21:02.619
Alive.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.626
You saved me.

21:11.071 --> 21:13.164
You saved my life.

21:14.174 --> 21:16.199
Care to return the favor?

21:16.543 --> 21:18.636
Are you in need of saving?

21:19.613 --> 21:22.275
You wondered why
you were chosen?

21:22.716 --> 21:27.176
Why God chose you above all other
humans to survive and serve his purpose?

21:29.022 --> 21:31.047
Now is the time
to find out why.

22:22.574 --> 22:24.599
Lords of Kobol,
hear our prayer.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.839
Bring us out of the darkness
and into the light.

22:27.913 --> 22:30.643
Give us the strength to show
mercy to those who are merciless...

22:30.716 --> 22:32.343
The President says
she will not yield.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.579
... hearts
that they may find peace.

22:34.653 --> 22:37.451
The President says
she will not yield.

22:39.625 --> 22:40.956
So be it.

22:47.266 --> 22:50.167
Come on, D, tell me he's not
actually gonna do this.

22:51.136 --> 22:53.604
Tell me she's not gonna
make him do it.

22:54.073 --> 22:57.531
Redeem our hearts that they may
find peace in the midst of war.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.204
What's going on?

23:00.879 --> 23:02.244
They're in.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.142
Quickly.

23:10.589 --> 23:11.817
Billy?

23:13.926 --> 23:15.359
Billy?

23:18.864 --> 23:21.094
Sir, they're in.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.025
Pretty, isn't it?

24:28.934 --> 24:30.561
Hello, Lieutenant.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.903
Something I can help you with?

25:29.394 --> 25:31.191
<i>I'm setting her down.</i>

25:52.551 --> 25:54.075
<i>Open the hatch.</i>

25:58.957 --> 26:01.187
<i>I'll release the bomb.</i>

26:01.260 --> 26:04.252
<i>Keep the engines warm and ready
for takeoff the second I get back.</i>

26:04.329 --> 26:06.627
<i>Yes, sir.
Close the hatch after me.</i>

26:06.899 --> 26:09.925
<i>If I'm not back in five
minutes, just go. You got it.</i>

26:49.241 --> 26:50.708
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

27:09.594 --> 27:12.358
Welcome back to Caprica, Lieutenant.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.626
Like what we've done
with the place?

28:34.413 --> 28:35.778
<i>Sharon.</i>

28:48.293 --> 28:50.853
<i>The frack are you doing?
Where are you going?</i>

28:51.596 --> 28:53.291
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

28:54.733 --> 28:56.098
<i>Okay.</i>

29:19.658 --> 29:21.683
<i>Sharon.</i>

29:41.446 --> 29:43.175
<i>This isn't happening.</i>

29:43.515 --> 29:45.142
Come on, Starbuck.

30:09.174 --> 30:10.903
Got anything left?

30:55.220 --> 30:56.710
Starbuck?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.823
Madam President,
no one needs to get hurt here.

31:06.898 --> 31:09.458
Then why don't you get off
my ship, Colonel?

31:09.935 --> 31:12.267
I'm placing you
under arrest.

31:23.515 --> 31:26.814
No. We're not doing this.
I'm in command here, Captain.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.945
Colonel, this is wrong.
You're relieved. Fall back.

31:30.121 --> 31:31.952
Madam President,
I wish to...

31:32.657 --> 31:35.751
Men, lay down your weapons.
Have you lost your fracking mind?

31:35.827 --> 31:38.261
Colonel, tell these Marines
to fall back.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.428
This is mutiny. You
know that. Yes, I do.

31:44.669 --> 31:47.433
But you can tell my father
I'm listening to my instincts.

31:47.505 --> 31:50.372
And my instincts tell me we
cannot sacrifice our democracy...

31:50.442 --> 31:53.240
just because the President
makes a bad decision.

31:59.784 --> 32:01.615
Put your guns down.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.282
Madam President, stand back.
Put your gun down, Captain.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.987
I will not have bloodshed,
neither your men nor my people...

32:10.128 --> 32:13.564
<i>on the Colonial One.
Put your gun down. All of you.</i>

32:16.635 --> 32:18.865
Please, put your gun down.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.173
Let's go.

32:27.012 --> 32:28.570
Let's go, Captain.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.655
Let's go.

32:52.504 --> 32:55.132
You're confused.
And scared.

32:56.341 --> 32:58.002
But it's okay.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.582
I'm not a Cylon.

33:08.353 --> 33:11.720
I'm Sharon Valerii.
I was born on Troy.

33:12.123 --> 33:15.854
My parents were
Katherine and Abraham Valerii.

33:18.029 --> 33:21.692
You can't fight destiny,
Sharon. It catches up with you.

33:21.766 --> 33:23.597
No matter what you do.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.367
Don't worry about us.
We'll see you again.

33:29.607 --> 33:33.008
We love you, Sharon.
And we always will.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.680
Boomer!
Come on! Lets go.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.748
What took you so long?
Go!

33:46.825 --> 33:48.486
Where's your helmet?

33:50.028 --> 33:52.622
Close the hatch.
Don't turn around.

34:24.095 --> 34:26.256
He put his weapon
right to my head.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.196
Said to tell you he was
following his instincts...

34:29.267 --> 34:31.167
whatever the hell that means.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.996
Bring him here.

34:34.305 --> 34:35.897
<i>What about Roslin?</i>

34:38.476 --> 34:40.569
We put her in the brig.

34:44.182 --> 34:47.379
Dradis contacts! It's
Boomer and Racetrack, sir.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.711
Put them on the speakers.

34:50.221 --> 34:52.815
<i>Galactica, Boomer.
Mission accomplished.</i>

34:52.891 --> 34:56.258
<i>Repeat, mission accomplished.
The base star is history!</i>

35:02.534 --> 35:05.697
There's some good news.
Bring them home, D.

35:06.571 --> 35:09.563
It's great to hear your voice,
Boomer. Come on home.

35:26.724 --> 35:28.351
It's okay.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.027
I can't believe it.

35:31.629 --> 35:34.359
You are like the last person
I expected to see.

35:36.067 --> 35:38.331
I could say the same thing
about you.

35:41.306 --> 35:43.433
You okay?
Yeah, thank you.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.053
I missed you.

36:10.435 --> 36:12.130
Hey, I...

36:14.339 --> 36:16.136
She's a Cylon!
No!

36:17.976 --> 36:20.638
You can't! She's pregnant.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.617
No!

36:53.545 --> 36:56.412
I know this place.
Of course you do.

37:07.091 --> 37:08.683
Go inside.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.975
I don't understand.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.080
Life has a melody, Gaius.

38:12.256 --> 38:14.724
A rhythm of notes
that become your existence...

38:14.792 --> 38:17.625
once they're played in harmony
with God's plan.

38:19.430 --> 38:22.888
It's time to do your part
and realize your destiny.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.330
Which is what, exactly?

38:25.436 --> 38:27.165
You are the guardian
and protector...

38:27.238 --> 38:29.798
of the new generation
of God's children.

38:33.044 --> 38:36.980
The first member of our family
will be with us soon, Gaius.

38:38.716 --> 38:41.048
It's time to make your choice.

38:41.886 --> 38:44.616
But I don't understand
what you're talking about.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.088
Really, I don't understand.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.684
Come. See the face of
the shape of things to come.

39:06.644 --> 39:08.839
Isn't she beautiful, Gaius?

39:40.645 --> 39:42.135
Open the cell.

39:52.356 --> 39:53.823
Close cell.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.171
Well done, Lieutenant.
Thanks.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.772
Hey, nice work.
Thanks. What's going on?

40:19.884 --> 40:22.546
A lot happened
while you were gone.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.654
Congrats.
Thanks.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.217
Congratulations
to both of you.

40:55.653 --> 40:58.816
You carried out a very difficult
and dangerous mission...

40:59.590 --> 41:01.057
and you did it...

41:01.125 --> 41:04.959
despite any personal misgivings
you may or may not have had.

41:05.830 --> 41:08.162
And for that, I'm very proud.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.326
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

41:11.869 --> 41:13.666
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

41:58.816 --> 42:01.011
Someone get a doctor!

42:03.087 --> 42:04.679
Hold his head.
