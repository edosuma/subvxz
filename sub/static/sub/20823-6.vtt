00:06.640 --> 00:09.529
** Woke up this morning *

00:09.570 --> 00:12.130
- There you go.
One black coffee for Angie,

00:12.180 --> 00:14.239
and one heart attack
In a cup for you.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.646
- Just go with cream
and sugar dad. It's a tad more

00:16.680 --> 00:19.376
customer-friendly.
- I see you're sporting

00:19.420 --> 00:22.116
a Full Windsor today. That's
pretty spiffy, even for you.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.118
- I got a meeting with a client.
Some Iavwer Angie wants

00:24.150 --> 00:26.789
to make friendly with.
Mel something. Apparently

00:26.820 --> 00:29.323
he's a big deal.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.453
- Front page big.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.720
Don't tell me he's repping her.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.228
- You've been following
the trial?

00:36.270 --> 00:38.261
- Everybody's following it!
You can't change the channel

00:38.300 --> 00:40.268
without seeing her psycho mug.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.530
She carved up her husband
in cold blood.

00:42.570 --> 00:44.435
- I'm not sure
which side he's on.

00:44.470 --> 00:46.370
All I know is I'm late.
Thanks for these.

00:46.410 --> 00:49.140
: Not so fast,
young man. I can't let someone

00:49.180 --> 00:51.205
so handsome escape
without a couple croissants!

00:51.250 --> 00:53.673
- You look like a movie star!

00:53.720 --> 00:55.847
Now come on Shona,
be honest. Is it too sew?

00:55.880 --> 00:59.509
- It's not the tie.
It's genetics.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.183
What?

01:05.230 --> 01:07.448
- Nothing, dad.
!

01:07.500 --> 01:09.593
- Nothing at all!

01:09.630 --> 01:11.621
***

01:11.670 --> 01:13.638
- Thank you, Mrs. Blunton.

01:13.670 --> 01:16.264
And how many glasses of wine
had you had

01:16.310 --> 01:20.201
when the argument started?
- Two, I think. Maybe three.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.641
***

01:30.320 --> 01:32.754
- I told Kyle I wanted
a divorce.

01:34.890 --> 01:37.222
- He locked himself
in his man cave.

01:37.260 --> 01:41.629
I went to my bedroom
and took a couple diazepam.

01:41.660 --> 01:44.663
The rest of the night is a blur.
- Not according to your

01:44.700 --> 01:47.396
neighbours, who heard you two
arguing until almost midnight.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.908
Or your cleaning lady, who came
in the next morning to find

01:49.940 --> 01:52.534
Kyle stabbed to death, and
you passed out in the bedroom,

01:52.580 --> 01:54.775
holding the bloody knife.
- Objection.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.347
- Sustained.
- I didn't kill him,

01:57.380 --> 01:59.314
I swear!_
You have to believe me.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.874
- It's not me you have
to convince, Mrs. Blunton,

02:00.920 --> 02:04.640
it's them. And I don't think
you're doing a very good job.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.681
- Your Honour!
- I'll withdraw.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.258
This is a witness statement

02:11.290 --> 02:13.394
signed by two neighbours

02:13.430 --> 02:15.455
who overheard the Bluntons
argumg at 11:40 PM,

02:15.500 --> 02:17.491
shortly after Mrs. Blunton
told her husband

02:17.530 --> 02:19.498
she wanted a divorce.

02:19.540 --> 02:23.704
- Nancy, can you please read
your husband's final words.

02:25.710 --> 02:29.407
- You'll take my money...
over my dead body.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.817
Nothing further, Your Honour.

02:32.850 --> 02:34.841
***

02:40.290 --> 02:43.418
- That was painful. I almost
felt bad for Naughty Nancy.

02:43.460 --> 02:46.349
- A good prosecutor knows
when not to pull her punches.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.356
- She wasn't just good,
she was scary-good.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.561
Kind of like, the love child
of the Glenn Close character

02:50.600 --> 02:52.568
in Damages and a barracuda.
- Shade--

02:52.600 --> 02:54.568
- I mean, not that she looked
like a barracuda.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.568
That woman could
work a power surt.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.566
Is it wrong
that I found her sexy?

02:58.610 --> 03:00.737
- Shade--
- I mean, on the one hand

03:00.780 --> 03:02.839
I was terrified, on the other
I was kinda turned on.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.201
- Shade!
- OK. Sorry.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.445
Alright, so where is
this Mel guy we're meeting?

03:07.480 --> 03:09.789
- Matt Shade,
meet Melanie Parker.

03:09.820 --> 03:12.709
Our client.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.287
- ...nice suit.

03:16.330 --> 03:20.699
- ** I see you and you see me

03:20.730 --> 03:23.995
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're makin' a scene *

03:24.030 --> 03:26.863
* Oh boy, you've got to know

03:26.900 --> 03:29.460
* What my head overlooks

03:29.510 --> 03:32.809
* The senses will show
to my heart *

03:32.840 --> 03:37.800
* When it's watching for lies
'cause you can't escape my *

03:37.850 --> 03:41.616
- * Private Eyes
They're watching you *

03:41.650 --> 03:44.744
* Private Eyes

03:44.790 --> 03:46.018
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

03:46.050 --> 03:48.382
* Watching you *

03:51.330 --> 03:53.821
- I am so sorry. If my partner
had actually listened

03:53.860 --> 03:56.021
when I explained who we were...
- It's okay, Ms. Everett.

03:56.060 --> 03:58.028
I just need you to serve some
papers, even a jock

03:58.070 --> 04:00.368
can't screw this up. Excuse me.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.561
- "Even a jock
can't screw this up?"

04:04.610 --> 04:06.578
This is an important
relationship for us.

04:06.610 --> 04:08.578
- Alright, I'll just focus on
her good qualities. She's got

04:08.610 --> 04:10.578
plenty of those.
- Do not even think about

04:10.610 --> 04:12.919
going there. Promise me that
you will keep this professional.

04:12.950 --> 04:15.874
OK? Prosecutors
are an endless source of work.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.842
Aren't you the one
who wants to grow the business?

04:17.890 --> 04:19.858
- Yeah, grow as in big cases,
not serving papers

04:19.890 --> 04:22.586
and bogus skip trace work.
- Baby steps.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.825
Today we serve papers,
tomorrow we do something real.

04:30.630 --> 04:36.068
- Have a seat.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.078
A shady realtor eluding the law?

04:40.110 --> 04:42.305
- I don't need you to serve
papers. This is more delicate.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.545
That's why I was hoping
you'd be alone.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.411
- Hey, delicate
is my middle name.

04:46.450 --> 04:48.418
- Actually, it's Kevin.
And someone who got

04:48.450 --> 04:51.942
244 penalty minutes during
his final season of pro hockey

04:51.990 --> 04:54.584
is not a man I'd describe
as "delicate."

04:54.620 --> 04:57.350
- You seem to know a lot
about me for a woman who thinks

04:57.390 --> 04:59.494
so little of me.
- Shade's my partner,

04:59.530 --> 05:01.350
and he can be trusted.
You have my word.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.398
- This is Graham Barker,

05:06.440 --> 05:09.568
juror number five.
He's thirty-eight, married,

05:09.610 --> 05:12.602
practicing Catholic.
His brother sells stocks,

05:12.640 --> 05:14.972
just like Kyle Blunton,
our murder victim.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.069
- Sounds like a dream juror.
- That's what we thought.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.442
My team of jury specialists
have him as a near-lock

05:19.480 --> 05:21.448
to hand in a guilty verdict.
And yet,

05:21.480 --> 05:23.789
the defence didn't execute
their right to strike him.

05:23.820 --> 05:26.118
- Maybe they made a mistake.
- It's possible.

05:26.150 --> 05:28.118
But we've been watching him
throughout the trial.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.128
He's been twitchy, nervous,
avoiding eye contact.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.698
Signs of guilt.
- You suspect jury tampering.

05:33.730 --> 05:35.698
- I'm not using that phrase yet.

05:35.730 --> 05:38.460
Sidney Woods is a very decent
and moral defence attorney,

05:38.500 --> 05:40.468
and I have to believe

05:40.500 --> 05:42.730
that he would not be behind
a stunt like this.

05:42.770 --> 05:44.738
But considering the scale and
importance of this case,

05:44.770 --> 05:46.704
I need to be certain.

05:46.740 --> 05:49.106
- So you want us to follow him.
Juror number five.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.472
- I want you to confirm if he's
been meeting with the defence.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.444
Don't interfere,
just observe and report.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.984
Here are some fake summons.
If anyone asks,

05:57.020 --> 05:58.544
you're serving papers.

05:58.590 --> 06:00.558
And no matter what happens,

06:00.590 --> 06:03.889
this can never
be linked back to me.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.592
- I knew it!
I had 229 penalty minutes

06:06.630 --> 06:09.622
my final season.
She was way off.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.025
- OK. Congratulations.
Can we focus on the case now?

06:12.070 --> 06:14.664
- This guy
is the dullest man alive:

06:14.700 --> 06:16.736
banker, married
his high school sweetheart,

06:16.770 --> 06:19.500
drives a mini-van,
owns a duplex in the burbs...

06:19.540 --> 06:22.941
- His photos are so wholesome my
gag reflex has been activated.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.902
- Well, unless you count

06:24.950 --> 06:27.441
churc_h barbecues and
volunteering at a soup kitchen.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.779
- Well, Graham Barker might
be nice. But that doesn't mean

06:30.820 --> 06:34.051
we have to be.
- I like where this is going.

06:34.090 --> 06:36.650
***

06:43.930 --> 06:45.192
- Oh!

06:45.230 --> 06:47.664
Why did I not choose paper?

06:47.700 --> 06:49.668
- Paper or plastic,
the modern dilemma.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.735
I bring my own bags
to subvert the system.

06:51.770 --> 06:53.601
Here, you can have this.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.471
- Yeah, I have a spare.

06:55.510 --> 06:58.673
Yeah, OK.

06:58.710 --> 06:59.972
There you go.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.409
- Thank you.

07:03.850 --> 07:06.182
It's nice to know there are
kInd people In the world.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.188
- Kindness is its own reward,
miss.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.620
***

07:17.730 --> 07:19.664
- We have ears.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.668
- Never trust a woman
wrth spilled frUIt.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.509
***

07:27.010 --> 07:29.672
Delicious casserole, honey.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.678
Is it time for The Bachelor yet?

07:31.710 --> 07:33.678
That's tomorrow, sweetie.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.676
Let's just watch the news.
: Not while

07:35.720 --> 07:37.187
I'm on jury duty.
Maybe there's a new rom-com

07:37.220 --> 07:39.188
on The Netflix.
- It's like listening to reruns

07:39.220 --> 07:40.949
of the Brady Bunch,
without the edge.

07:40.990 --> 07:43.527
- I didn't even know that people
ate tuna casseroles anymore.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.528
: On second thought,
I'm gonna go hit

07:45.560 --> 07:47.551
the squash court.
Work off some of this casserole.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.068
- It's an odd time
for a squash fix.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.125
- Unless squash
is code for bribe,

07:52.170 --> 07:54.263
and he's playing
with the defence.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.699
- I knew this guy was too nice.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.264
Here he comes.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.528
***

08:05.250 --> 08:07.673
***

08:09.550 --> 08:11.484
***

08:14.060 --> 08:17.882
: Where's he going?

08:20.700 --> 08:23.669
That doesn't
look much like a YMCA.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.258
- Not to mention
he didn't take his racquet.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.868
Do you recognize this place?
- No, I've never been here

08:28.900 --> 08:31.039
in my life. Looks like
some kind of club.

08:31.070 --> 08:33.868
- Something tells me this isn't
listed in the Yellow Pages.

08:33.910 --> 08:36.299
Hahaha! I know, I know.

08:36.340 --> 08:38.900
- Hm...
He sounds in a good mood.

08:38.950 --> 08:41.077
- I think that I'd be happy too
if I was about to receive

08:41.120 --> 08:43.145
a sweet payoff
from a corrupt defence attorney.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.650
- We lost the mic.

08:48.690 --> 08:50.658
You think he's onto us?
- No. Sometimes they fall off.

08:50.690 --> 08:53.818
We need to get inside.
- Here.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.318
I'll try to find us
a way in.

08:59.370 --> 09:02.737
***

09:06.710 --> 09:08.678
: Do you see anybody?

09:08.710 --> 09:10.678
- No, but I hear something.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.871
It sounds like... Rossini?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.046
- I thought you didn't listen
to classical.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.219
- Well, I do when it's Bugs
Bunny. Have you never seen

09:16.250 --> 09:17.148
The Rabbit Of Seville?

09:17.190 --> 09:19.909
- Hmm, I'm
more of a Simpsons girl myself.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.929
- I found a door,
but it's locked.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.228
***

09:29.230 --> 09:31.721
***

09:34.840 --> 09:36.330
You've got company.

09:36.370 --> 09:37.837
That guard's headed your way.

09:37.870 --> 09:40.134
***

09:42.010 --> 09:44.979
- Almost got it!

09:45.010 --> 09:49.117
***

09:54.160 --> 09:56.082
***

10:00.700 --> 10:03.897
- I think I know_
why we lost our mic.

10:11.440 --> 10:15.137
- Shade!

10:15.180 --> 10:17.398
- Guess I didn't
meet their dress code.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.271
- She put you up to this,

10:20.320 --> 10:21.844
didn't she?

10:21.880 --> 10:23.780
- Debbie, my wife.
She paid you to follow me!

10:23.820 --> 10:26.311
- No, she didn't hire me
to follow you.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.750
Look, my name is Bugs Rossini,
I'm a reporter.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.156
I heard this building
was Selena Gomez's

10:31.190 --> 10:33.021
recording studio.
- There is not

10:33.060 --> 10:34.925
a recording studio here.
You have the wrong address.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.861
- My bad. I didn't mean to
interrupt your little sex club.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.664
It is a nudist club,

10:40.700 --> 10:43.407
where we're free to be in our
natural state as God intended.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.432
- I believe that God intended
you to keep your boys zipped up.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.208
I've been stressed as of late.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.912
Yeah, this place?
This club get me to relax.

10:53.950 --> 10:56.942
I haven't been able to so
since, you know, jury duty.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.117
Well, you seem
pretty relaxed to me.

10:59.150 --> 11:01.084
So, if you wouldn't mind...

11:08.330 --> 11:10.992
: The defence
didn't get to juror number five.

11:11.030 --> 11:14.932
He's a regular Dudley Do-Right,
with one minor eccentricity.

11:14.970 --> 11:16.938
- Barker likes
to let his boys out

11:16.970 --> 11:18.938
for a little afternoon samba,
if you know what I'm saying.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.074
- He's part of a nudist club,

11:21.110 --> 11:23.476
and his wife doesn't know.
He hasn't been to the club

11:23.510 --> 11:25.478
since he started jury duty,
which most likely explains

11:25.510 --> 11:29.173
his odd behaviour. So,
you have nothing to worry about.

11:31.020 --> 11:34.387
I believe the word you're
looking for is congratulations.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.958
- I can think of another word.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.959
This arrived in my office
10 minutes ago.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.427
And how do they know
we're working for you?

11:45.470 --> 11:47.768
You're the P.I.s.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.337
All I know is that_ _
that's leverage for a mistrial.

11:50.370 --> 11:53.373
- Make Nancy's charges disappear
or this goes to the press.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.970
Whoever's wrote that wants Nancy
to go free, and I'm not about

11:56.010 --> 11:57.978
to be blackmailed
because of your incompetence.

11:58.010 --> 12:00.877
- Just give us 24 hours.
We'll figure this out.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.888
- You're damn right you will.
Because if this

12:02.920 --> 12:04.888
ends up sinking
the biggest case of my career,

12:04.920 --> 12:07.855
you're both going down
with the ship.

12:12.560 --> 12:17.293
***

12:17.330 --> 12:19.389
- Morning, Jules.
- Morning, Dad.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.398
You want in on the pool?

12:21.440 --> 12:23.408
- Since when _
are you into gambling?

12:23.440 --> 12:25.408
- We're making bets on when
Grandpa and Shona have their

12:25.440 --> 12:28.136
first kiss. 10 buck buy-in,
winner take all. I've got

12:28.180 --> 12:31.149
Saturday, Mom next Thursday,
and Liam the following Friday.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.148
- It's never gonna happen.
Dad knows the cardinal rule:

12:33.180 --> 12:35.546
never dip your pen
in the company ink.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.879
- Alright.
Um, he's wearing cologne.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.457
- Put me down for Tuesday.

12:44.190 --> 12:45.782
- Good. Anybody want this
more than me?

12:45.830 --> 12:47.991
: What?

12:48.030 --> 12:50.794
- Well, it just...
it smells like you're wearing--

12:50.830 --> 12:52.297
- Old Spice.
No woman can resist.

12:52.330 --> 12:54.469
- Nothing.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.298
Just wondering how things
are going with you and Shona?

12:57.340 --> 12:59.467
- Well, there's nothing going on
between Shona and me.

12:59.510 --> 13:01.478
- Methinks

13:01.510 --> 13:04.001
he doth protest too much.
- Oh, yeah.

13:04.050 --> 13:07.838
- Oh, I can't make pizza night
on Saturday.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.587
I got a thing with my boys.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.588
- Hmm. A thing
with your "boys," huh?

13:12.620 --> 13:14.451
Where exactly
is this thing happening?

13:14.490 --> 13:16.458
- Oh, it's
this little place downtown

13:16.490 --> 13:18.458
called_none of
your freaking busmess.

13:18.490 --> 13:21.129
Now if you'll excuse me...

13:21.160 --> 13:23.469
- Score one for Jules!

13:23.500 --> 13:26.094
- Jules!
- Get used to it, old man.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.330
- Hey, what's your take
on workplace romances?

13:30.370 --> 13:32.930
- There's not enough tequila
in the world, Shade.

13:32.980 --> 13:36.609
: No, no. Not me
and you. My Dad and Shona.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.404
They run a business together

13:39.450 --> 13:41.338
and things are heating up. It's
upsetting the laws of nature.

13:41.380 --> 13:44.087
- Well, maybe they just like
to hang out.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.486
Or maybe they're soulmates.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.488
- That they
had instant chemistry.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.385
That they're better together
than apart.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.227
That they're the kind of people
that connect so well they--

13:52.260 --> 13:55.093
- I was gonna say

13:55.130 --> 13:58.395
"complete each other".

13:58.430 --> 14:02.161
- The angle's about right.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.169
- That tree back there would
make a pretty good tripod.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.337
***

14:11.480 --> 14:14.244
- This is exactly
where it was taken.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.168
Wait a minute.

14:16.220 --> 14:19.383
What's this?
- "Wildebeest".

14:19.420 --> 14:21.513
- It's one
of those gross energy drinks.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.279
- So our culprit's
a 20

14:26.160 --> 14:28.128
- Menthol.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.390
- Who smokes menthols
these days?

14:30.430 --> 14:33.558
- I have a pretty good idea.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.466
Employees got their hands
in the company kitty?

14:38.510 --> 14:41.434
As Friedrich Nietzsche said,

14:41.480 --> 14:45.473
"the best weapon against an
enemy is another enemy".

14:45.510 --> 14:47.410
40 years on the job.
I'll bust your case wide open.

14:47.450 --> 14:50.510
So remember my name.
Norm Glinski.

14:50.550 --> 14:52.438
I put the dick in private dick.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.412
***

14:54.460 --> 14:56.416
There's no way

14:56.460 --> 14:59.588
that guy's a real P.I.
- Oh, he's real alright.

14:59.630 --> 15:02.121
Used to do work for my dad
back in the day.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.264
- Glinski was

15:04.300 --> 15:06.268
a forensic accountant
for the RCMP.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.268
After he retired,
my dad

15:08.300 --> 15:10.165
hired him
to work a few P.I. cases.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.030
- He liked to cut corners.

15:12.070 --> 15:14.038
My father did not.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.571
- Right.
- My dad finally cut him loose

15:16.610 --> 15:18.578
and Glinski never forgave him.
Then one day my dad's cousin

15:18.610 --> 15:21.215
got swindled
by his financial advisor.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.184
- I know the feeling.
- We investigated on his behalf,

15:23.220 --> 15:26.314
but... couldn't get any traction
because the advisor

15:26.350 --> 15:28.659
hired a private investigator
to run interference.

15:28.690 --> 15:30.624
- A former accountant who knew
how to cover his tracks.

15:30.660 --> 15:33.595
- Norm Glinski's entire P.I.
career is a middle finger to

15:33.630 --> 15:36.724
my father. He will lie, cheat,
and steal for whoever's paying.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.228
- A shortcut guy.
- Exactly. There's a right way

15:39.270 --> 15:41.192
and a wrong way to win a case.
My dad taught me that.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.505
There he is.

15:44.540 --> 15:47.509
- The question is, why is he
following around a juror?

15:49.680 --> 15:51.671
- Let's find out.

15:51.710 --> 15:55.441
***

16:02.020 --> 16:03.681
- Please state your full name

16:03.730 --> 16:07.518
and occupation for the record.
- Eleanor Brown.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.755
Founder of Eleanor Brown
Investment Securities.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.634
I'm... I was
Kyle Blunton's boss.

16:13.670 --> 16:17.766
- A year ago I went through

16:17.810 --> 16:21.439
an ugly divorce. Kyle and Nancy
helped me through it.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.449
We became friendly.
- So far your old buddy

16:24.480 --> 16:26.539
hasn't made eye contact
with anyone.

16:26.580 --> 16:30.584
- Glinski's too smart_ to show us
who he's working for.

16:30.620 --> 16:33.180
- Or whoever he's working for
isn't here.

16:33.220 --> 16:36.383
- And how would you describe
Kyle and Nancy's relationship?

16:36.420 --> 16:39.127
- Well, like any marriage,
it had its ups and downs,

16:39.160 --> 16:42.493
and Kyle sometimes
said he had two wives,

16:42.530 --> 16:45.590
Nancy and his job.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.064
But Nancy understood that.

16:48.100 --> 16:51.809
You know,
she would never... have...

16:51.840 --> 16:54.377
- I know that this is difficult,
Ms. Brown,

16:54.410 --> 16:56.605
but I need your help
to give context.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.200
The night Kyle was murdered,

16:59.250 --> 17:01.343
he called you at 10:40 PM.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.416
How did he sound?

17:03.450 --> 17:05.441
- Scared.

17:05.490 --> 17:08.118
I'd never heard him
like that before.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.788
I heard Nancy yelling
in the background. I...

17:10.830 --> 17:14.618
I assumed they were
having a fight.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.525
I never thought that she...

17:18.600 --> 17:21.569
- He was calling to ask me

17:21.600 --> 17:24.307
for the name of my...
divorce attorney.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.243
- Glinski's on the move.

17:30.280 --> 17:34.171
This is where
we divide and conquer.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.485
***

17:39.690 --> 17:41.658
: It doesn't
make any sense.

17:41.690 --> 17:44.579
If Glinski's working for the
defence, then where is he going?

17:44.630 --> 17:47.827
- All I know is if it's Glinski,
he's up to no good.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.100
- Whoa. I lost him. Hang tight.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.571
- Rookie mistake, Everett.

18:08.620 --> 18:11.589
Didn't your daddy ever teach you
how to do a proper tail?

18:11.620 --> 18:13.588
When following a mark,

18:13.620 --> 18:15.588
always tuck behind
another vehicle.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.520
- Thanks for the tip, Glinski.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.778
- If I catch you
tailing me again,

18:19.830 --> 18:21.798
you're gonna be...

18:21.830 --> 18:24.867
a punchline in heels
at the next P.I. convention.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.437
You got that?
And here's something else.

18:27.470 --> 18:30.598
"Better a diamond with a flaw

18:30.640 --> 18:32.858
than a pebble without."

18:32.910 --> 18:35.629
Confucius.

18:40.750 --> 18:45.687
***

18:45.720 --> 18:48.382
- He fell for it.
Got him?

18:48.420 --> 18:50.786
- I got him.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.786
***

19:01.840 --> 19:04.263
***

19:11.580 --> 19:14.140
***

19:16.880 --> 19:19.542
Hey Angie.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.717
Nancy Blunton
lives in Forest Hill, right?

19:24.290 --> 19:26.485
- Because I think that's where
your buddy Glinski's going.

19:28.530 --> 19:31.419
Oh wait. Hold the phone.
He's going down the street.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.438
152 Wembly.

19:33.470 --> 19:36.291
- Nobody on the juror's list
lives there.

19:38.610 --> 19:42.706
***

19:42.740 --> 19:45.641
- It looks like the neighbour's
handing Glinski money.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.614
Hold on.

19:59.630 --> 20:01.450
Alright, here we go.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.468
Uh, 152 Wembly.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.219
It's a Jerry Macklehearn.
He lives alone.

20:06.270 --> 20:08.932
Why would this guy hire Glinski?
- I'm gonna find out.

20:08.970 --> 20:10.858
- Shade...

20:10.910 --> 20:15.677
Shade?
Don't do anything stupid.

20:17.650 --> 20:21.017
***

20:21.050 --> 20:24.486
Where the hell are you?
- I'm in the house.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.488
What part of "there's a
right way and a wrong way to win

20:26.520 --> 20:29.887
a case" don't you understand?
- Just give me a minute.

20:39.930 --> 20:41.932
***

20:48.040 --> 20:51.840
Oh, this is so worth it!
Turns out our friendly neighbour

20:51.880 --> 20:54.269
may not be so friendly
after all.

20:59.450 --> 21:02.954
Dude. We need to talk.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.058
- I had nothing to do
with the murder.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.728
I was at a Jays game that night.
Look, I swear, man.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.726
Nancy and I are just friends.
- Looks like

21:12.770 --> 21:15.034
more than a friend to me.
- I'm an architect.

21:15.070 --> 21:17.038
I offered her some advice
on a house rede5ign,

21:17.070 --> 21:18.935
and we became close.

21:18.970 --> 21:20.870
I even helped her
kick her diazepam habit.

21:20.910 --> 21:22.878
- Well, you did a bang-up job,
considering she popped a couple

21:22.910 --> 21:24.946
the night
she murdered her husband.

21:24.980 --> 21:27.448
- She didn't murder Kyle.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.619
- Ijust do. It's...

21:29.650 --> 21:32.915
Nancy shared everything with me.

21:32.950 --> 21:35.316
- Exactly how close
were you two?

21:35.360 --> 21:37.453
- Nothing happened between us,
if that's what you mean.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.879
We both agreed to wait
'til after her divorce.

21:39.930 --> 21:41.659
- You knew she was planning
a divorce?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.588
- I was the one
who suggested it.

21:43.630 --> 21:45.894
Kyle was a dirt bag.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.932
You know, every time Nancy

21:47.970 --> 21:49.938
went to go visit her mom,
or spend the weekend

21:49.970 --> 21:52.006
horseback-riding, he'd bring
over one of his mistresses.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.076
So I decided
to get some evidence.

21:54.110 --> 21:56.408
- Hence these photographs.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.408
- I realized he_ must have been
sneaking them

21:58.450 --> 22:00.771
in through the back.
So I hid outside and took these.

22:04.550 --> 22:06.711
- I don't know.

22:06.750 --> 22:09.583
- And why didn't you
show these to the cops?

22:09.620 --> 22:12.453
- I was worried I would look
like a crazed Peeping Tom,

22:12.490 --> 22:14.458
which would only
make things worse for Nancy.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.721
- So you're not connected
to the defence team at all?

22:18.770 --> 22:20.738
- No.

22:20.770 --> 22:22.738
But I couldn't just stand by
and do nothing.

22:22.770 --> 22:24.931
So I found a P.I. who promised
to turn things around

22:24.970 --> 22:26.938
for Nancy in exchange
for five grand.

22:26.970 --> 22:30.007
- Thanks.

22:33.180 --> 22:36.513
You're not gonna believe what
your pal Glinski's been up to.

22:38.520 --> 22:45.050
- 2000 years ago Aristotle said,
"We are what we repeatedly do."

22:45.090 --> 22:47.957
- Hey!

22:48.000 --> 22:49.991
A client presents you
with information

22:50.030 --> 22:51.998
that could impact a murder trial
and your first move

22:52.030 --> 22:53.839
is to rig the jury?

22:53.870 --> 22:57.067
- Don't come in here all high
and mighty, Everett.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.068
- Oh, you are interfering
with this justice system

22:59.110 --> 23:01.578
and you know it.

23:01.610 --> 23:03.646
Media's already

23:03.680 --> 23:06.604
declared Nancy guilty,
her lawyer incompetent...

23:06.650 --> 23:09.141
- So you thought you'd take
matters into your own hands,

23:09.180 --> 23:11.148
is that it?
Just rig the verdict

23:11.190 --> 23:14.114
and blackmail some poor juror
with naked photos?

23:14.160 --> 23:16.617
- Oh! That's what Barker
was d0ing.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.651
- You took our picture
and sent it to Mel!

23:18.690 --> 23:22.057
- Don't lecture me, Everett!
So I was planning

23:22.100 --> 23:24.068
a little jury tampering.
So what?

23:24.100 --> 23:26.193
You were planning
the same thing.

23:26.230 --> 23:30.633
- We were investigating you!
- Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

23:30.670 --> 23:34.071
- These games stop now. Or I'm
gonna get your licence revoked.

23:34.110 --> 23:37.671
- Forget it, Everett.
You've got nothing on me.

23:37.710 --> 23:40.008
...Everett. So I was planning

23:40.050 --> 23:41.915
a little jury tampering.

23:41.950 --> 23:43.884
So what? You were planning
the same thing.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.808
- Rookie mistake, Glinski.

23:45.850 --> 23:47.818
Never shoot your mouth off
unless you know who's listening.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.556
- For you to leave

23:50.590 --> 23:52.524
the jurors alone.
And stop threatening Mel.

23:52.560 --> 23:53.527
- You got it.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.494
- And get and air freshener.

23:55.530 --> 23:57.669
It reeks in here.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.931
- Well done, Everett.

24:00.970 --> 24:02.835
Just ignoring one thing:

24:02.870 --> 24:04.565
Nancy Blunton

24:04.610 --> 24:06.635
didn't kill her husband.
- Are you actually trying

24:06.670 --> 24:08.103
to convince me that you care
about this woman?

24:08.140 --> 24:10.973
- How many murders have you seen
committed on diazepam?

24:11.010 --> 24:13.570
Downers don't ignite anger,

24:13.620 --> 24:15.576
it suppresses it.
- Well, you should get a bowl

24:15.620 --> 24:17.645
of them handy for your clients.
- Funny, Everett!

24:17.690 --> 24:19.840
That's funny. In the meantime,
Nancy gets to spend

24:19.890 --> 24:23.212
25 years of her life in jail
for a crime she didn't commit.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.997
- Glinski won't be a problem
anymore.

24:38.170 --> 24:40.536
- Well, you get this crinkle
in your brow when you worry.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.275
- OK, fine.

24:42.310 --> 24:44.278
Look, Glinski
might be a cheater,

24:44.310 --> 24:46.278
but he's got good instincts.
He made a good point

24:46.310 --> 24:48.813
about the diazepam. If he thinks
Nancy Blunton's innocent,

24:48.850 --> 24:50.818
there might be something to it.

24:50.850 --> 24:53.080
- So we present the evidence,
let the courts sort it out.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.088
- By the time that happens,
Nancy will be convicted.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.088
An appeal could take years.

24:58.990 --> 25:00.719
- We need to find
something concrete.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.628
- Are you suggesting we try to
dig up evidence to help Nancy?

25:04.670 --> 25:07.639
Our client, the prosecutor,
isn't going to like that much.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.934
- Mel doesn't need to know.
- But all we have to go on

25:09.970 --> 25:13.303
is a blurry photograph of Kyle's
supposed lover. How are we

25:13.340 --> 25:15.638
supposed to find her?
- Eleanor Brown said that

25:15.680 --> 25:17.648
work was Kyle's second wife.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.671
Maybe there was a reason
for that.

25:19.710 --> 25:22.941
I think I need
to pay her a visit.

25:33.830 --> 25:36.321
- Angie Everett,
Everett Investigations.

25:36.360 --> 25:39.158
Do you know this woman?
- Well, that's Sadie Tufts.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.191
What's this about?

25:41.240 --> 25:44.107
- I'm tying up some loose ends
for Prosecutor Mel Parker.

25:44.140 --> 25:46.165
Did Ms. Tufts work with Kyle?

25:46.210 --> 25:49.134
- Well, she was his assistant.
But he fired her months ago.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.772
- Because they were having
an affair.

25:50.810 --> 25:53.973
- I am not at liberty to discuss
the private lives

25:54.020 --> 25:56.011
of my former employees.
- Please, Ms. Brown.

25:56.050 --> 25:58.712
It's possible that Nancy Blunton
didn't murder Kyle.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.183
- Well, you think
Sadie Tufts did?

26:00.220 --> 26:01.983
- Was she upset
about being fired?

26:02.020 --> 26:03.954
Could she have been
holding a grudge?

26:03.990 --> 26:05.958
- I'm not sure about that.
- If Nancy's innocent,

26:05.990 --> 26:07.924
don't you think that every lead
should be followed?

26:10.160 --> 26:12.128
Thanks for coming in, Sadie.
Can you tell us about

26:12.170 --> 26:15.059
your relationship with Kyle?
- Sure.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.136
Kyle and I had a fling, but I
was the one who called it off.

26:17.170 --> 26:19.161
- And then you were fired.
That must have been

26:19.210 --> 26:21.337
quite the gut punch.
- Well, it was actually

26:21.380 --> 26:23.336
a relief. I knew it was coming.

26:23.380 --> 26:25.871
When I ended the affair, Kyle
turned everyone against me.

26:25.910 --> 26:29.118
I got so paranoid I started
secretly backing up my files.

26:29.150 --> 26:32.642
- The old build-up-ammo-
in-case-you-get-fired trick.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.658
- Exactly, but then
the company gave me

26:34.690 --> 26:36.817
a generous severance package
and I had no reason to use it.

26:36.860 --> 26:38.953
- Doesn't mean that you weren't
still pissed at Kyle.

26:38.990 --> 26:40.958
- I know where this is going,
and I was in Edinburgh

26:41.000 --> 26:44.128
when he was murdered.
Cousin's wedding.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.990
- Did you ever notice Kyle
acting odd?

26:46.030 --> 26:47.861
Worried about something?
Somebody?

26:47.900 --> 26:49.333
- Because of the alarm thing
you mean?

26:49.370 --> 26:52.339
- His house alarm.

26:52.370 --> 26:55.828
He was obsessed with it.
He'd turn it on as soon

26:55.880 --> 26:57.848
_ as we were inside.
As if anyone would want to steal

26:57.880 --> 26:59.848
one of his stupid brass tigers.
- He would arm the alarm

26:59.880 --> 27:01.973
even when he was home?
- Always.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.012
I had to text him whenever I'd
arrived so he could shut it off.

27:05.050 --> 27:08.019
He made me park
at a nearby ice rink.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.881
- Wouldn't_it have been easier
just to give you the code?

27:10.930 --> 27:12.852
- He didn't trust anyone
with that code.

27:12.890 --> 27:15.199
Not even his cleaning lady.

27:15.230 --> 27:17.152
- One day he gets this call
at work.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.668
She triggered the alarm
by accident.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.134
He wouldn't even text her
the code then.

27:22.170 --> 27:26.766
He drove over there
just to deal with it himself.

27:26.810 --> 27:28.903
: Nancy Blunton
may be innocent.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.908
- We have two new witnesses
who claim Kyle was paran0id,

27:30.950 --> 27:34.909
his mistress and a neighbour.
Apparently his alarm
was on all the time.

27:34.950 --> 27:37.168
- What does this have to do with
you and the picture

27:37.220 --> 27:39.188
of juror number five?
- Nothing. We took care of that.

27:39.220 --> 27:41.780
- But we discovered the cleaning
lady didn't have the alarm code,

27:41.820 --> 27:43.981
which suggests that someone
turned it off during the night.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.328
- Which means Kyle may have
let in his own murderer.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.794
- We were just being thorough.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.866
- You work for me,
not the defence.

27:50.900 --> 27:53.061
- But you might be sending
an innocent woman to jail.

27:53.100 --> 27:56.137
Look at all the evidence!
- The unsubstantiated accounts

27:56.170 --> 27:58.468
of a jilted ex-lover
and a stalker?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.831
- Isn't this at least worth
taking a look at?

28:00.880 --> 28:03.474
I mean, don't you wanna file
a... get an injunction to...

28:03.510 --> 28:05.808
to... stop the court

28:05.850 --> 28:07.909
from doing what it does?

28:07.950 --> 28:11.078
- I am a prosecutor.
It's my job to convict her,

28:11.120 --> 28:13.213
not to root around
for conspiracy theories.

28:13.250 --> 28:15.810
- So you're
not gonna do anything?

28:15.860 --> 28:18.328
- Now that you mention it, I am:

28:18.360 --> 28:20.328
You're fired.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.328
- Joke's on her.
The job was already over.

28:24.370 --> 28:28.192
Look, I know you were hoping
for a long-term relationship,

28:28.240 --> 28:30.196
but we're better off
without her.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.060
- We don't need Mel. We need
evidence that proves our theory.

28:32.110 --> 28:33.998
- You're still convinced
Nancy's innocent.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.974
- I don't know. But I won't
be able to sleep at night

28:36.010 --> 28:37.898
without knowing for sure.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.906
- We talk to her.
- We tried that already.

28:39.950 --> 28:42.111
- Not Mel. Nancy.

28:47.220 --> 28:48.812
- This is highly unorthodox.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.487
- You got another ace
up your sleeve?

28:50.520 --> 28:52.727
We only need five minutes.

28:56.030 --> 28:59.022
What's going on?
- It's OK.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.236
Here we go.

29:03.270 --> 29:07.058
- I'm Angie Everett.
This is my partner, Matt Shade.

29:07.110 --> 29:09.271
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

29:09.310 --> 29:12.108
- The alarm in your house.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.243
Was it on the night
that Kyle was killed?

29:14.280 --> 29:16.771
- Well, I'm sure it was.
- And you didn't

29:16.820 --> 29:19.345
turn it off?
To leave, take a walk?

29:21.860 --> 29:24.454
- I wasn't lucid enough
to leave my room,

29:24.490 --> 29:26.458
let alone the front door.
- When the maid

29:26.490 --> 29:28.458
arrived in the morning,
the alarm was switched off.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.559
Now according to our sources,
she didn't have the code.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.068
- So if you didn't disable it,

29:33.100 --> 29:36.797
then Kyle most likely did.
Possibly to let someone in.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.865
- Wait, are you saying--
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

29:38.910 --> 29:41.936
Just stop right there, OK?
The interview's over. Guard!

29:41.980 --> 29:43.948
- Sid...
- It's OK. No. No.

29:43.980 --> 29:46.574
It's fine. Would you take
Mrs. Blunton back to her cell?

29:46.610 --> 29:48.475
- No, Sid, wait, please--
- No. No. No.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.317
They're... no. It's OK.

29:50.350 --> 29:54.252
Trust me. It's OK.
- OK.

29:56.190 --> 29:58.556
- How dare you give my client
false hope like that?

29:58.590 --> 30:02.549
Her alarm--
- Was turned off. At 11:17 PM.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.568
- From the alarm company

30:04.600 --> 30:06.864
records. I'm her defence
attorney. What the hell

30:06.900 --> 30:08.868
do you think I've been doing?
- Then why haven't you raised it

30:08.900 --> 30:10.492
in court?
- Nancy Blunton doesn't remember

30:10.540 --> 30:13.566
a single thing that happened
after 9:30 PM.

30:13.610 --> 30:17.171
IfI bring up the alarm,
the prosecution will attack

30:17.210 --> 30:19.906
her character all over again,
and that works against

30:19.950 --> 30:22.214
everything I'm building.
- You think she did this.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.480
- My job is not to judge.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.409
My job is to deliver the best
possible outcome for my client.

30:27.450 --> 30:30.010
- By throwing in the towel and
gunning for a lesser sentence.

30:30.060 --> 30:32.949
- That woman may be innocent,
and you're leaving out

30:32.990 --> 30:35.629
the fact that Kyle
may have let someone else in.

30:35.660 --> 30:39.369
- A reasonable doubt only exists
when there's another suspect.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.628
You want to help Nancy?

30:40.670 --> 30:43.491
Find someone else
who could have done this.

30:43.540 --> 30:47.465
Otherwise, I suggest you stay
the hell away from this court.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.141
***

31:02.590 --> 31:05.457
- Whoa. A three croissant
morning. Trouble in lavwer land?

31:05.490 --> 31:08.550
- No, it's all good, dad.
By all good I mean we got fired.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.420
- Oh, I'm sorry, Matt.

31:10.460 --> 31:12.928
I assume there's
a prinCIpled reason.

31:12.970 --> 31:15.461
- What if I told you
I believe Nancy is innocent?

31:15.500 --> 31:17.468
- Considering that you were
working for the prosecution,

31:17.500 --> 31:19.639
I'd say this whole getting-fired
thing is starting to make sense.

31:19.670 --> 31:23.003
- Angie and I found evidence in
her favour, but it's not enough.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.008
- Som_e mountains
are too big to climb, son.

31:25.050 --> 31:29.077
Take it from me, a man needs to
know when to cut his losses.

31:33.220 --> 31:37.350
- Yeah, it uh...
remains unexplored territory.

31:37.390 --> 31:38.926
- And what about your date
on Saturday?

31:38.960 --> 31:40.928
- No, there is no date.
Turns out she just wanted me

31:40.960 --> 31:44.020
to go over next year's
business plan for the Red Bird.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.026
- Well, it's a long game, Dad.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.038
You still have time
for a comeback.

31:48.070 --> 31:50.129
- Yeah, well...
probably just as well.

31:50.170 --> 31:52.138
You called it, son.

31:52.170 --> 31:55.628
business and pleasure
don't mix.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.046
***

32:02.350 --> 32:04.386
: Sidney said we needed

32:04.420 --> 32:07.139
to find another suspect
for Kyle's murder, right?

32:07.190 --> 32:09.579
What if the motive wasn't
personal, it was busmess?

32:09.620 --> 32:13.226
- He screwed someone at work,
but not in the literal sense?

32:13.260 --> 32:15.251
- Eleanor Brown said,
"Work was his other wife"

32:15.300 --> 32:17.097
What if he pissed off
the wrong client?

32:17.130 --> 32:19.963
- Sadie Tufts said she secretly
copied all his files.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.968
Maybe she still has them
on a hard drive?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.139
- Alright, I'll give her a call.
I'll see you at the agency.

32:24.170 --> 32:27.469
Thanks, dad.
- OK. Have a good one.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.671
: Sadie didn't tell you

32:29.710 --> 32:31.701
what any of this stuff was?
- No. She didn't know.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.048
She just copied it
off Kyle's computer.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.116
- Well, this is hopeless!
I mean, none of us

32:36.150 --> 32:38.380
know anything about finance.
- Then let's get some help.

32:38.420 --> 32:40.388
Who do you know who's an expert

32:40.420 --> 32:42.354
at screwing people over
financially?

32:42.390 --> 32:44.984
- No. No way.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.250
Do not make me do this.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.398
- "Happiness is a continuation
of happenings

32:55.440 --> 32:58.500
which are not resisted."
Deepak Chopra.

32:58.540 --> 33:00.405
- I need _
your accounting expertise,

33:00.440 --> 33:02.305
not a philosophy lesson.

33:02.340 --> 33:04.774
- You flat_ter me. _
But you're wasting your time.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.778
There's the exit.
- You said yourself

33:06.810 --> 33:09.745
that Nancy didn't do it.
I managed to track down

33:09.780 --> 33:11.748
Kyle's work files. I've got bank
records and trade confirmations,

33:11.790 --> 33:15.157
loan contracts...
- And you think

33:15.190 --> 33:18.455
that I'm going to magically find
a new suspect in there?

33:18.490 --> 33:20.651
- It's worth a shot.
I mean,

33:20.690 --> 33:24.023
you know more about this than
anyone on Sid's defence team.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.766
If we can produce new evidence

33:26.800 --> 33:28.768
that Kyle left
a shady finance trail,

33:28.800 --> 33:31.166
then maybe we can raise
the spectre of other suspects.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.179
- Myjury tampering plan
was so much simpler.

33:36.610 --> 33:39.602
- For you, a special rate.
Double.

33:39.650 --> 33:43.677
You know, there was a time
when my dad believed in you.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.280
Guess I thought
there was a soul in there.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.550
Boy, did I think wrong.

33:48.590 --> 33:50.581
***

33:56.230 --> 33:58.221
: Zoe, what's
the status with the jury?

33:58.270 --> 34:01.194
- They're on recess, but they're
about to start final arguments.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.333
- Damn it. OK, call us
if anything changes.

34:03.370 --> 34:05.406
Alright. Let's go through this
one more time.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.431
- Alright. 6 PM,

34:07.470 --> 34:09.438
Kyle sets the alarm.
9:30, Nancy tells him

34:09.480 --> 34:11.698
she wants a divorce,
and a fight breaks out.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.218
- And Kyle locks himself
in his man cave,

34:14.250 --> 34:16.172
Nancy goes to the bedroom.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.586
She pops a few diazepam say,
10:00.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.713
- 10:40, Kyle
calls his boss Eleanor

34:20.750 --> 34:22.786
to ask her
for her lawyer's name.

34:22.820 --> 34:25.653
11:17, Kyle shuts off the alarm.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.726
- 11:40, Kyle yells,

34:27.760 --> 34:29.728
"You'll take my money
over my dead body."

34:29.760 --> 34:31.591
- Except...

34:31.630 --> 34:35.396
Kyle was broke.
- Norm Glinski.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.829
I hear you do a pretty good
impression of a private eye.

34:37.870 --> 34:40.464
- Matt Shade. I heard you did a
good impression

34:40.510 --> 34:42.535
of a hockey player.
- Hey! You don't get to make fun

34:42.580 --> 34:45.401
of my partner, that's my job.
- What do you mean,

34:45.450 --> 34:46.644
Kyle was broke?
- I looked through

34:46.680 --> 34:51.140
the prospectus documents on the
stocks that Kyle was peddling.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.885
- Ponzi scheme!

34:52.920 --> 34:55.889
Except I don't think
Kyle knew about it.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.888
He transferred two hundred grand

34:57.920 --> 34:59.854
of his own funds
into company bonds;

34:59.890 --> 35:03.223
nobody working a Ponzi scheme
would use his own money.

35:03.260 --> 35:06.661
- What if Kyle found out that
night his bonds were worthless?

35:06.700 --> 35:09.134
- By talking to Eleanor.

35:09.170 --> 35:11.138
Asking if he could cash them out

35:11.170 --> 35:12.762
in order to hide his assets
from Nancy in the divorce.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.675
- Kyle finds out

35:14.710 --> 35:16.632
that his wife's gonna
take him to the cleaners.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.648
So he calls Eleanor at 10:40

35:18.680 --> 35:21.615
to help him hide his assets.

35:21.650 --> 35:23.709
- But by then,
Nancy's out like a light.

35:23.750 --> 35:26.787
- So he invites Eleanor over
to approve the transaction.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.482
Shuts off the alarm
to let her in.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.488
- Once there,
she's forced to admit

35:31.530 --> 35:33.486
that the portfolio is worthless.
If I'm Kyle,

35:33.530 --> 35:35.498
I demand payment,

35:35.530 --> 35:38.226
using my knowledge
of her scam as leverage.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.226
- And if I'm Eleanor,

35:40.270 --> 35:42.238
I'm gonna want to shut him up.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.500
Ideally forever.
- Holy crap.

35:44.540 --> 35:46.405
Are we saying
what I think we're saying?

35:46.440 --> 35:48.408
- If we're right,

35:48.440 --> 35:50.408
at 11:40,

35:50.440 --> 35:52.408
when people said Kyle yelled

35:52.450 --> 35:54.372
"You'll take my money
over my dead body..."

35:54.420 --> 35:56.615
- He wasn't yelling at Nancy,

35:56.650 --> 35:59.687
he was yelling
at the real murderer...

35:59.720 --> 36:03.281
Eleanor Brown.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.459
- Oh yeah, that big murder case.

36:05.490 --> 36:08.721
The house is just around
the corner from here.

36:08.760 --> 36:11.820
- This woman. We need to know if
she ever parked here.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.826
It would have been
maybe two months ago?

36:13.870 --> 36:15.895
- Yeah, I remember her.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.760
Yeah, she parked
right over there.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.836
White luxury sedan.

36:19.870 --> 36:22.304
- Hard to forget,

36:22.340 --> 36:25.343
she was acting strange.
She was wearing a big fur coat,

36:25.380 --> 36:27.439
but she came back with it
rolled up under her arms,

36:27.480 --> 36:30.517
even though it was freezing out.

36:30.550 --> 36:34.281
- Yeah. I checked to see if she
was drunk, but she seemed fine.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.481
Said she just spilt wine on it,

36:36.520 --> 36:39.455
I kept wondering
why she didn't wear it anyways.

36:39.490 --> 36:42.527
- Thanks, you've been
a big help.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.790
- Hundred bucks
says that wasn't Wine

36:44.830 --> 36:46.798
on that coat. That was blood.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.798
- Kyle made her park here, just
like Sadie Tufts. He didn't want

36:48.840 --> 36:50.796
his neighbours to know
he was hiding his money.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.808
- We need to go see Mel.
- Not without proof.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.808
- We've got the Ponzi scheme
which implies motive,

36:54.840 --> 36:56.808
evidence that the alarm
wasn't set, and now this guy

36:56.840 --> 36:58.808
puts Eleanor here
on the night of the murder.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.806
There's a right way

37:00.850 --> 37:02.772
and a wrong way to win a case.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.845
- Texting Zoe. If Eleanor's
at the court again,

37:04.890 --> 37:08.610
there's a parking lot
we need to visit.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.616
- Eleanor's still here. The jury

37:10.660 --> 37:12.628
started deliberating an hour
ago, but the judge hasn't

37:12.660 --> 37:15.254
released anyone yet. They're
saying it could be any minute.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.599
- Well, that doesn't sound good.
- Keep us posted, Zoe.

37:18.630 --> 37:21.667
- We need to get there before
the jury comes back.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.333
- Well, it's the only
white luxury sedan here.

37:28.380 --> 37:32.373
- Hold this up
as high as you can.

37:32.410 --> 37:33.479
- Why am I standing here
like an idiot?

37:33.510 --> 37:35.910
- Well, I need you to be
my amplifier. The idiot part

37:35.950 --> 37:38.919
I can't help you with. We're
directly under the courtroom.

37:38.950 --> 37:40.918
So this will amplify the signal
from the key

37:40.950 --> 37:43.054
in Eleanor's pocket.
- What happened to the whole

37:43.090 --> 37:46.059
"right way, wrong way" thing?
- It's time sensitive.

37:46.090 --> 37:48.752
Higher.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.858
- You really think
this car is going to get hacked

37:49.900 --> 37:52.323
by some cheap piece of--

37:52.370 --> 37:54.838
- Thank you, mother Russia.

37:57.700 --> 38:01.636
- Luminol spray.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.808
Look! It's blood!

38:04.850 --> 38:06.875
- OK, gotta go.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.777
- Got it.

38:09.820 --> 38:13.938
- Ladies and gentlemen,
have you reached your verdict?

38:13.990 --> 38:16.015
***

38:21.460 --> 38:23.325
- We have, Your Honour.
- Here!

38:25.870 --> 38:28.464
- Stop! Hold the court!

38:28.500 --> 38:29.569
- Order!

38:29.600 --> 38:33.331
Order!
- Your honour, please.

38:33.370 --> 38:35.975
- Um... look!
- Shade,

38:36.010 --> 38:39.571
what the hell are you doing?
- This is the trunk

38:39.610 --> 38:42.670
of Eleanor Brown's car. She went
to go see Kyle that night.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.688
You gotta trust us.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.712
- Your Honour,
I need to request a recess.

38:47.750 --> 38:49.957
- On the grounds

38:49.990 --> 38:52.049
of needing time
to process fresh evidence.

38:52.090 --> 38:54.524
If this proves to be valid,

38:54.560 --> 38:56.596
it would not
be in the public interest

38:56.630 --> 38:58.928
to continue prosecution
against Nancy Blunton.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.858
- Request granted.
Court adjourned.

39:06.570 --> 39:09.038
- Officer, don't let her leave!

39:15.620 --> 39:18.885
In a stunning'development,

39:18.920 --> 39:21.912
charges against Nancy Blunton
have been dropped while

39:21.960 --> 39:25.020
a new suspect emerges in Eleanor
Brown, Kyle Blunton's boss.

39:25.060 --> 39:27.119
Ms. Brown is believed
to have been operating

39:27.160 --> 39:29.526
a Ponzi scheme
which the victim threatened

39:29.560 --> 39:31.892
to expose when--
- Something tells me we

39:31.930 --> 39:33.761
haven't heard the last
of this case.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.665
- There's an online pool
about who's gonna play Nancy

39:35.700 --> 39:37.634
in the movie.

39:37.670 --> 39:39.638
- Yeah.
- Honey, maybe you should

39:39.670 --> 39:41.934
lay off the gambling for a
while, you know...

39:41.980 --> 39:45.609
given Gramps and Shona, and...
- I still can't believe it.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.606
They had chemistry.
And the cologne!

39:47.650 --> 39:49.572
I was definitely seeing lip-lock
on Saturday.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.645
- Yeah, well...
- You're not the only one.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.487
- Don't look so guilty,

39:53.520 --> 39:55.158
I knew what you guys were doing.

39:55.190 --> 39:57.715
I almost put a tenner down
on Saturday myself.

39:57.760 --> 40:01.184
- Oh, crap. I'm late.
Gotta go, don't wait up!

40:01.230 --> 40:03.198
- Have fun!
- Take care!

40:03.230 --> 40:07.667
- Angie hates that one.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.759
- The way he's going,
I'll put a tenner on never.

40:17.980 --> 40:21.541
***

40:21.580 --> 40:23.616
- Worth every penny.

40:23.650 --> 40:25.811
How did it feel to be one
of the good guys again?

40:25.850 --> 40:27.841
- Don't get sentimental on me,
Everett.

40:27.890 --> 40:29.858
It was a one shot deal.

40:29.890 --> 40:31.858
- Well, you didn't
charge me double, so...

40:31.890 --> 40:33.858
Maybe there's a soul in you yet.

40:33.890 --> 40:36.495
- You did most of the work,

40:36.530 --> 40:38.919
and as a wise man once said,

40:38.970 --> 40:41.837
"A good work ethic

40:41.870 --> 40:45.567
is the only investment
that never fails."

40:45.610 --> 40:47.703
- Which of your gurus
is it this time?

40:47.740 --> 40:49.879
- No, it was a man I should've
listened to more often

40:49.910 --> 40:51.878
when he was around.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.969
Your father.

40:54.010 --> 40:58.549
***

40:58.590 --> 41:02.014
Oh, the hockey player!

41:10.530 --> 41:13.863
- Meh. I needed
the tax write off.

41:13.900 --> 41:15.868
- That crinkle-in-your-brow
thing, you're doing it again.

41:15.900 --> 41:19.666
- Ijust... Ifeel bad
about how things ended with Mel.

41:19.710 --> 41:21.905
We blew the biggest case
of her career.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.931
- Well, let me see
what I can do.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.005
- No, Shade...
- Oh, come on!

41:26.050 --> 41:27.972
We're partners now. You vouched
for me going into this.

41:28.010 --> 41:30.649
Let me see ifI can fix it.

41:30.680 --> 41:33.888
***

41:35.920 --> 41:38.525
- Mr. Shade. Shut the door.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.528
Sit down.

41:42.830 --> 41:46.527
- The police executed a search
warrant of Eleanor Brown's house

41:46.570 --> 41:48.868
this morning. They found a fur
coat, dry cleaned the day

41:48.900 --> 41:50.663
after the murder.
Tag still on it.

41:50.700 --> 41:53.260
- Oh. Sounds like someone's
covering their tracks.

41:53.310 --> 41:55.301
- Not well enough. Forensics
can detect blood months later.

41:55.340 --> 41:57.228
And the blood splatter you found

41:57.280 --> 41:59.771
sealed the case.
- Hm.

41:59.810 --> 42:01.778
- Now look at us
making small talk.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.175
- Without all
that chirpy lipping

42:04.220 --> 42:06.643
you were so famous for
on the ice.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.817
You really know how to get under
a person's skin.

42:08.860 --> 42:13.251
- I'm sorry for losing you
your case.

42:13.290 --> 42:16.589
- Don't apologize for doing
your job. That's what

42:16.630 --> 42:17.995
I hired you for.
- And then you fired us.

42:19.970 --> 42:23.337
Wait a second. Was that part
of your plan?

42:23.370 --> 42:25.258
- Don't make me
smarter than I am.

42:25.310 --> 42:27.562
All I know is that emotions

42:27.610 --> 42:29.339
push people to work harder,

42:29.380 --> 42:31.644
and I needed
the evidence to be airtight.

42:35.620 --> 42:38.987
Besides, when justice prevails,
we all win, right?

42:42.620 --> 42:44.929
Join me for a drink?

42:44.960 --> 42:46.928
- Uh... yeah.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.928
Love to.
