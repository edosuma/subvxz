WEBVTT

00:02.625 --> 00:05.333
FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS
HAVE AN INEXPLICABLE WAY

00:05.333 --> 00:07.166
OF MANIFESTING THEMSELVES
IN SUBCONSCIOUS

00:07.166 --> 00:09.667
AND NOT ALWAYS
SELF-AWARE BEHAVIOR.

00:09.667 --> 00:12.500
YOUR VERBAL DECONSTRUCTION
OF TEEN ANGST

00:12.500 --> 00:14.458
IS REALLY OUTDATED, COLBY.

00:14.458 --> 00:17.166
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON
BETWEEN ME AND PETEY.

00:17.166 --> 00:19.000
HE'S JUST A FRIEND,

00:19.000 --> 00:21.959
YOUR BEST FRIEND,
I MIGHT ADD.

00:21.959 --> 00:25.792
I HAVE NO SUBCONSCIOUS
SUBLIMINAL INTENTIONS
TOWARDS HIM.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.959
JUST A FRIEND, HUH?

00:28.959 --> 00:32.333
YES. THAT'S ALL.

00:32.333 --> 00:36.667
PERIOD. END OF SENTENCE,
DISSERTATION, AND POST-MODERN
DIATRIBE.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.792
NOW CAN WE GO TO SLEEP?

00:41.333 --> 00:44.041
Colby on TV: SO IS PETEY
A FRIEND THE SAME WAY

00:44.041 --> 00:46.667
YOU AND I ARE JUST FRIENDS?

00:48.041 --> 00:49.542
Sam: YEAH...

00:49.542 --> 00:51.875
OF COURSE.

00:53.208 --> 00:55.583
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS AFRAID OF.

01:06.041 --> 01:07.917
Man:
THANK GOD THAT'S OVER.

01:07.917 --> 01:11.417
TREAD LIGHTLY,
BOOK BOY.

01:12.542 --> 01:15.708
WATCH THIS.
THIS'LL BE FUN.

01:15.708 --> 01:18.375
OH!

01:18.375 --> 01:19.542
(SIGHS)

01:19.542 --> 01:22.166
BACK TO INTELLIGENT LIFE
AS WE KNOW IT.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.750
YEAH, YOU KNOW
THAT SHOW?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.917
IT'S LIKE BAD
AIRPLANE FOOD.

01:25.917 --> 01:27.125
YOU KNOW,
THE TEEN HYPERBOLE,

01:27.125 --> 01:28.542
IT'S HARD ON
THE STOMACH,

01:28.542 --> 01:31.625
AND THE WRITERS
MUST SIT AROUND
WITH A THESAURUS

01:31.625 --> 01:34.417
JUST SEEKING OUT
4 SYLLABLE WAYS

01:34.417 --> 01:37.041
TO ABUSE THE
ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

01:39.375 --> 01:41.208
WELL, I ONLY WATCH IT
TO TORTURE YOU.

01:41.208 --> 01:43.041
YEAH, WELL,
IT WORKS.

01:43.041 --> 01:45.041
I MEAN, WHO TALKS
LIKE THAT COLBY GUY?

01:45.041 --> 01:47.417
HE'S LIKE
SOME MUTANT
ENGLISH PROFESSOR

01:47.417 --> 01:49.208
PSYCHO THERAPIST
FREAK.

01:49.208 --> 01:53.208
WE CAN'T ALL BE BRILLIANT
LITERARY SNOBS LIKE YOURSELF.

01:53.208 --> 01:55.208
YOU SHOULD READ
SOME OF THE CRAP
I HAVE TO EDIT.

01:55.208 --> 01:57.417
YOU EDIT MY STUFF.

02:02.083 --> 02:04.041
(WHISPERING)
Except your stuff.

02:07.959 --> 02:09.834
OK, OK, OK, OK.
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

02:09.834 --> 02:12.875
I HAVE TO FINISH THIS,
AND I HAVE 2 MORE AFTER THAT.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.417
GO WRITE A BOOK
OR SOMETHING.

02:14.417 --> 02:16.750
I CAN'T. THAT SHOW
HAS OFFICIALLY DESTROYED

02:16.750 --> 02:19.083
SOME VERY NECESSARY
BRAIN CELLS.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.333
GET OVER IT.

02:22.333 --> 02:26.166
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
SO I LIKE A TEEN SOAP.
SO WHAT?

02:26.166 --> 02:27.625
THE WAY IT POSSESSES YOU

02:27.625 --> 02:29.291
IS WHAT FRIGHTENS ME,
HONESTLY.

02:29.291 --> 02:31.625
EVERY WEDNESDAY AT 8:00,

02:31.625 --> 02:35.750
YOU ENTER THIS
SUPERNATURAL PORTAL
OF TEEN ANGST.

02:35.750 --> 02:39.083
I HAVE AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
TO IT YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

02:39.083 --> 02:41.667
WILL SAM AND COLBY
EVER GET TOGETHER?

02:41.667 --> 02:44.083
WILL SAM CHOOSE PETEY?
WILL SAM CHOOSE COLBY?

02:44.083 --> 02:47.291
FIND OUT NEXT WEEK AS WE
CONTINUE TO BEAT A DEAD DOG

02:47.291 --> 02:49.333
ALL THE WAY
INTO SYNDICATION!

02:49.333 --> 02:51.875
YOU KNOW, I THINK
SUBCONSCIOUSLY,

02:51.875 --> 02:54.500
YOU LIKE THE SHOW
JUST AS MUCH AS I DO.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.208
SPOKEN VERY MUCH

02:56.208 --> 02:59.000
LIKE THE INDECISIVE
NONCOMMITTAL CHARACTER
OF SAM.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.542
HOW DARE YOU?

03:12.542 --> 03:14.625
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I SOUND LIKE HER?

04:05.375 --> 04:07.041
Dawson: WE'LL HAVE TO LOOP
COLBY'S VIRGIN SPEECH
IN THE THIRD ACT.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.417
HIS MUMBLING'S OUT OF CONTROL.

04:08.417 --> 04:10.542
AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT
THE NETWORK NOTES.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.125
THEY DID NOT CLEAR
MASTURBATE AS
ACCEPTABLE DIALOGUE.

04:13.125 --> 04:14.417
IT'S A CLINICAL TERM.

04:14.417 --> 04:15.917
THEY SUGGESTED
"WALKING YOUR DOG."

04:15.917 --> 04:17.375
WALKING
YOUR DOG?

04:17.375 --> 04:19.041
AND YOU HAVE TO TALK
TO BEN TODAY.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.083
HE HAS NO IDEA
THAT HIS CHARACTER'S
COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.750
HE'S GOING TO LOSE IT.

04:22.750 --> 04:23.917
AFTER LUNCH.

04:23.917 --> 04:25.417
I'VE GOTTA STEP IN
WITH THE WRITERS.

04:25.417 --> 04:28.250
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
SONY PICTURES TELEVISION, INC.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.250
Man: THEY'RE SOUL MATES.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.250
THEY HAVE TO END UP
TOGETHER.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.917
AH, BUT NOT IN
THE FIRST SEASON.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.125
YOU GOT NOWHERE TO GO
AFTER THAT.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.208
WHAT ARE WE TALKIN' ABOUT?

04:36.208 --> 04:37.917
THE PERPETUAL
DILEMMA, DAWSON.

04:37.917 --> 04:39.583
DOES SAM HOOK UP
WITH FEISTY PETEY

04:39.583 --> 04:41.792
OR SOUL MATE COLBY
IN THE SEASON
CLIFFHANGER?

04:41.792 --> 04:42.834
Woman:
IF SHE CHOOSES PETEY,

04:42.834 --> 04:45.125
IT WILL BREAK CONVENTION
AND SURPRISE THE AUDIENCE.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.542
Man: SURPRISE,
NOT SATISFY.

04:47.542 --> 04:50.875
COLBY IS SAM'S SOUL MATE.
IT'S DESTINY.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.458
Second man: THIS SHOW
IS ABOUT TWISTING
THE CONVENTION, RIGHT?

04:52.458 --> 04:55.125
LET'S BREAK THIS NOTION
OF DESTINY AND FATE.

04:55.125 --> 04:58.458
DAWSON, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:00.792 --> 05:02.333
I THINK YOU GUYS
ARE ONTO SOMETHING.

05:09.458 --> 05:10.625
Assistant:
LOOK, I'VE GOTTA GO.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.750
HERE HE COMES.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.417
I PICKED UP YOUR SUIT
FOR THE WEDDING.

05:14.417 --> 05:16.083
IT'S HANGING ON THE BACK
OF YOUR DOOR,

05:16.083 --> 05:18.625
AND DON'T FORGET THAT THE CAR
IS GOING TO COME AND PICK YOU UP

05:18.625 --> 05:21.125
FOR THE AIRPORT TOMORROW
AT NOON.
RIGHT.

05:21.125 --> 05:23.792
AND REBECCA CALLED
TO CONFIRM DINNER.

05:23.792 --> 05:25.083
OHH, POSTPONE IT. AGAIN.
AND DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

05:25.083 --> 05:26.417
WHAT LOOK?

05:26.417 --> 05:27.792
FOR THE RECORD,

05:27.792 --> 05:30.000
I'M A NICE GUY...
I'M JUST LATE FOR EDITING.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.542
(SIGHS)

05:32.542 --> 05:34.625
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

05:36.458 --> 05:39.417
(SIREN)

06:04.000 --> 06:06.166
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
IN QUITE THE HURRY
THIS MORNING.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.625
SHERIFF DOUG,
HEY, LOOK, I'M SORRY.

06:08.625 --> 06:11.000
I'M LATE AND I'M TRYING
TO GET TO CLASS.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.041
WELL, I HAVE NO CHOICE

06:13.041 --> 06:14.500
BUT TO ISSUE YOU
A CITATION

06:14.500 --> 06:15.667
FOR DOING 40 IN A 25.

06:15.667 --> 06:19.417
LOOK, I ALREADY HAVE
ALL THESE POINTS
AGAINST MY LICENSE.

06:19.417 --> 06:21.750
YOU THINK MAYBE
THERE'S SOMETHING
I COULD DO

06:21.750 --> 06:24.708
TO GET YOU TO LOOK
THE OTHER WAY?

06:26.542 --> 06:28.125
MAY I REMIND YOU,
MR. McPHEE,

06:28.125 --> 06:31.166
THAT ATTEMPTING TO BRIBE
A PUBLIC OFFICIAL

06:31.166 --> 06:32.208
IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE?

06:32.208 --> 06:35.834
UH, YOU KNOW, I WAS
JUST HOPING THAT MAYBE, UM...

06:35.834 --> 06:38.917
I COULD APPEAL TO YOUR
GREATER SENSE OF COMPASSION.

06:46.041 --> 06:47.333
ALL RIGHT.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.750
JUST THIS ONCE,
I'LL LET YOU GO

06:48.750 --> 06:50.166
WITH A WARNING.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.458
THANKS, HONEY.

06:51.458 --> 06:54.041
NO, NO, NEVER, NEVER
CALL ME HONEY.

06:54.041 --> 06:57.333
DUDE, IT'S A DESERTED ROAD.
CHILL.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.917
DON'T CALL ME DUDE,
EITHER.

06:58.917 --> 07:01.250
ALL RIGHT, TONIGHT?
DINNER LATER?

07:01.250 --> 07:02.458
YEAH. I'LL COOK.
MY PLACE.

07:02.458 --> 07:05.083
GREAT. I'LL BRING
THE HANDCUFFS.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.792
KIDDING.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.083
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:08.083 --> 07:09.083
I'LL SEE YOU.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.375
YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.583
JACK...

07:12.583 --> 07:13.750
SLOW DOWN.

07:13.750 --> 07:14.875
YOU GOT IT.

07:14.875 --> 07:16.834
ALL RIGHT.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.792
(ENGINE STARTS)

07:35.583 --> 07:37.417
I GOT THAT,
MR. WITTER.

07:37.417 --> 07:38.583
YOU'RE THE BOSS,
REMEMBER?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.250
I'M JUST TRYING
TO LEND A HAND.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.792
THE RUSH TODAY WAS CRAZY.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.875
KA-CHING.
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

07:43.875 --> 07:47.125
YEAH, 6 MONTHS AND GOING STRONG.
NO COMPLAINTS, RIGHT?

07:49.458 --> 07:50.792
OH, PACEY, THERE YOU ARE.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.000
I'VE GOT YOUR
NEW MENU DESIGNS

07:52.000 --> 07:53.750
ALONG WITH
ALL YOUR REVISIONS.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.750
EXCELLENT. I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THOSE.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.291
HEY, CORY,
I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE

07:57.291 --> 07:58.291
IF ANYBODY'S LOOKING
FOR ME, OK?

07:58.291 --> 07:59.291
YEAH.

07:59.291 --> 08:00.625
SHALL WE?

08:14.542 --> 08:16.000
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND
A NEW PRETENSE TO MEET.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.417
THIS IS...THE THIRD TIME

08:17.417 --> 08:19.542
I'VE HAD TO REVIEW
THE MENU DESIGN.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.333
I'M SURE NO ONE
SUSPECTS A THING.

08:24.333 --> 08:27.834
I'M NOT EXACTLY THE MOST
INVISIBLE GUY IN
CAPESIDE THESE DAYS.

08:27.834 --> 08:30.500
I'M SURE SOMEBODY'S
STARTING TO SUSPECT.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.166
AS LONG AS
IT'S NOT MY HUSBAND.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.667
"WE TWO BOYS
TOGETHER CLINGING...

08:36.667 --> 08:38.457
"ONE THE OTHER,
NEVER LEAVING...

08:38.457 --> 08:40.667
"UP AND DOWN,
THE ROADS GOING

08:40.667 --> 08:42.457
NORTH AND SOUTH
EXCURSIONS MAKING..."

08:44.500 --> 08:46.208
Jack: MR. HAMPTON...

08:46.208 --> 08:47.959
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

08:47.959 --> 08:49.542
DO I HAVE TO
KEEP READING?

08:49.542 --> 08:51.834
WELL, THE POEM'S
NOT FINISHED.

08:51.834 --> 08:53.291
NO, OFFENSE,
MR. McPHEE,

08:53.291 --> 08:56.458
BUT THIS IS
A POEM BY A GUY
ABOUT ANOTHER GUY.

08:56.458 --> 08:58.208
IT'S LIKE,
A GAY POEM.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.542
(STUDENTS LAUGH)

09:00.542 --> 09:02.667
I WASN'T AWARE THAT POEMS
HAD SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.000
(STUDENTS LAUGH)

09:05.000 --> 09:06.208
SEE, THIS GAY POEM

09:06.208 --> 09:09.041
AND OTHERS LIKE IT ACTUALLY
GOT WHITMAN FIRED FROM HIS JOB.

09:09.041 --> 09:11.875
SEE, HE WAS AN OUTCAST
MOST OF HIS LIFE.

09:11.875 --> 09:13.917
BUT HE DIDN'T CARE.
HE LOVED HIS COUNTRY.

09:13.917 --> 09:15.667
HE LOVED THE FREEDOM
THAT IT STOOD FOR,

09:15.667 --> 09:16.917
AND HE CELEBRATED
THE AMERICAN SPIRIT

09:16.917 --> 09:20.542
EVERY CHANCE
THAT HE GOT.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.500
AND HERE WE ARE
150 YEARS LATER,

09:22.500 --> 09:24.542
AND WE'RE STILL
LAUGHING AT HIM.

09:24.542 --> 09:27.458
YOUR ASSIGNMENT
FOR THIS WEEKEND:

09:27.458 --> 09:30.000
IS TO FIND A WAY TO SAY
THROUGH THE CONVENTIONS
OF POETRY

09:30.000 --> 09:30.875
WHAT YOU ARE AFRAID TO SAY.

09:30.875 --> 09:32.375
I WANT YOU GUYS
TO WRITE ABOUT SOMETHING

09:32.375 --> 09:35.208
THAT YOU'RE SCARED OF.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.750
WE'RE GONNA READ
THESE THINGS OUT LOUD
ON MONDAY TO EACH OTHER,

09:37.750 --> 09:40.375
SO I WOULD HOPE
THAT YOU GIVE THE SAME
COURTESY TO EACH OTHER

09:40.375 --> 09:41.875
THAT YOU DID NOT GIVE
TO MR. WHITMAN TODAY.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.208
HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND.

09:43.208 --> 09:43.917
HEY, HEY, HEY.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.583
HI.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.917
OH, LET ME SEE
MY GODDAUGHTER.

09:48.917 --> 09:50.166
HEY, GORGEOUS.

09:51.542 --> 09:52.542
OH, MY GOD.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.583
(LAUGHS)

09:54.583 --> 09:56.250
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
SO ARE YOU.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.708
HI, SWEETHEART.

09:57.708 --> 09:58.708
GOD, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

09:58.708 --> 09:59.750
YOU, TOO.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.583
AHH, TOO LONG.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.917
SO I JUST CAUGHT
SOME OF YOUR ACT.

10:05.917 --> 10:08.333
LOOKS LIKE CAPESIDE
FINALLY HIRED A GOOD TEACHER.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.959
GOOD TEACHERS ARE JUST
TRAUMATIZED STUDENTS

10:09.959 --> 10:11.750
TRYING TO ERASE
WHATEVER WENT WRONG

10:11.750 --> 10:13.458
WITH THEIR OWN
HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.750
DO YOU THINK THAT
YOU COULD ERASE MY MEMORIES
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?

10:15.750 --> 10:17.417
THAT WOULD BE A LIFETIME
IN A NUNNERY.

10:19.708 --> 10:21.750
SO, WHAT'S ON YOUR AGENDA
TONIGHT, HUH?

10:21.750 --> 10:24.041
WELL, I GOTTA HAVE
DINNER WITH THE SHERIFF,

10:24.041 --> 10:25.917
BUT IF YOU WANT TO
CATCH A DRINK LATER?

10:25.917 --> 10:27.959
YEAH, SURE.
GOSH, 6 MONTHS IN,

10:27.959 --> 10:29.792
YOU TWO ARE ALREADY
AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE, HUH?

10:29.792 --> 10:31.917
YES, BUT WITH
THE ADDED ELEMENT

10:31.917 --> 10:33.125
OF PRETENDING
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER

10:33.125 --> 10:34.625
EVERY TIME WE PASS
ON THE STREET.

10:34.625 --> 10:36.125
OH, STILL?

10:36.125 --> 10:37.291
YEAH,
WHAT CAN I SAY?

10:37.291 --> 10:39.792
HE'S A PARANOID,
CLOSETED FREAK...

10:39.792 --> 10:44.125
BUT HE'S MY PARANOID
CLOSETED FREAK.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.125
YOU STAYING AT
THE POTTER B&B?

10:45.125 --> 10:47.750
MM-HMM. I'LL BE THERE,
AWAITING YOUR PHONE CALL.

10:47.750 --> 10:48.959
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE

10:48.959 --> 10:50.166
BEFORE YOU MAKE ME LATE
FOR MY NEXT CLASS.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.458
OK, SORRY.

10:52.458 --> 10:53.750
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.000
HMM.

11:05.959 --> 11:08.583
YOU'RE HERE!

11:08.583 --> 11:11.708
YAY!

11:11.708 --> 11:13.333
OH, LOOK AT YOU.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.792
YOU GET MORE HANDSOME
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU.

11:14.792 --> 11:16.333
MOM, I LOOK TERRIBLE.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.125
I'VE AGED 10 YEARS
IN THE PAST 9 MONTHS.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.125
WELL, YOU WEAR IT WELL.

11:20.125 --> 11:22.458
SO, HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT?

11:22.458 --> 11:23.959
OH, IT WAS OK.

11:23.959 --> 11:25.667
I'VE GOT 5 SCENES
TO WRITE BY TOMORROW

11:25.667 --> 11:26.792
AND THE SEASON FINALE
SHOOTS IN A WEEK,

11:26.792 --> 11:28.000
I STILL DON'T
HAVE AN ENDING,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.500
BUT OTHER THAN THAT...

11:30.500 --> 11:32.458
I'M JUST SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

11:32.458 --> 11:35.834
AND MISS MY MOM'S WEDDING?
NOT A CHANCE. NOT A CHANCE.

11:35.834 --> 11:38.166
Lily: DAWSON!

11:38.166 --> 11:39.000
LILY.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.542
HEY, YOU GOT TALL!

11:44.542 --> 11:47.500
DAWSON, I JUST GOT
ANNIE HALL  ON DVD.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.875
WANNA WATCH IT WITH ME?

11:48.875 --> 11:50.166
SURE. GO SET IT UP.

11:54.041 --> 11:55.583
ANNIE HALL?

12:17.041 --> 12:17.959
HMM.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.750
HMM.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.208
HEY, I'M SORRY
TO INTERRUPT YOU
WHILE YOU GUYS ARE EATING,

12:42.208 --> 12:44.125
BUT THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.917
EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING
FOR PACEY WHITTER.

13:08.917 --> 13:10.959
JOEY POTTER
AS I LIVE AND BREATHE!

13:10.959 --> 13:12.083
HI.

13:12.083 --> 13:15.458
OH, GOOD GOD, WOMAN,
YOU'RE HEAVY!

13:15.458 --> 13:17.667
WATCH IT, WHITTER.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.500
I'M JUST KIDDING.
THEY TOLD ME YOU WEREN'T
GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

13:19.500 --> 13:23.667
OH, LONG STORY.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.792
EVERYBODY!

13:25.792 --> 13:28.291
THIS IS
JOSEPHINE POTTER,

13:28.291 --> 13:30.500
OFFICIAL TALENT ALUMNI
AND QUALITY CAPESIDE STOCK,

13:30.500 --> 13:34.291
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GIVE HER A NICE,
WARM WELCOME HOME, HUH?

13:34.291 --> 13:37.083
(APPLAUSE)

13:39.083 --> 13:41.458
PACEY, IS THIS ALL YOURS?

13:41.458 --> 13:44.333
MINE, THE BANK'S,
SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERS.
YOU HUNGRY?

13:44.333 --> 13:46.417
I'M STARVING.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.792
LOOK AT YOU.
I GOTTA GIVE YOU
ANOTHER HUG.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.458
GOD, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU!

13:50.458 --> 13:51.792
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

13:51.792 --> 13:54.834
IT HAS BEEN
WAY TOO LONG, JO.

13:56.792 --> 13:57.917
HEY.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.041
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY! HEY!

14:13.041 --> 14:17.125
HEY, GIRL!
HEY, PRETTY MAMA!

14:17.125 --> 14:19.875
WHAT'S UP?!

14:19.875 --> 14:21.625
GOD, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, MAN!

14:21.625 --> 14:22.625
HOW ARE  YOU?!

14:22.625 --> 14:23.792
GOOD. I'M GREAT.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.000
HANDSOME!

14:25.000 --> 14:28.041
OK, IN HONOR OF THIS
MOMENTOUS OCCASION,

14:28.041 --> 14:29.750
OPEN BAR FOR EVERYONE!

14:29.750 --> 14:31.500
GIVE IT UP!
WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

14:37.166 --> 14:39.583
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME
I PAINTED YOU IN THE NUDE?

14:39.583 --> 14:42.542
OH, YOU GOT EXCITED
AND YOU SPROUTED--

14:42.542 --> 14:44.083
OH, WHOA, HEY, HEY!

14:44.083 --> 14:45.750
A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN I BARGAINED FOR.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.041
WHATEVER.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.250
IT'S ALL GOOD.
IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.417
BESIDES, DAWSON PROBABLY
WOULD EVENTUALLY KILL ME

14:50.417 --> 14:52.333
FOR TAKING HIS ONLY
SOUL MATE, RIGHT?

14:58.083 --> 14:59.667
HEY, WHAT'S UP
WITH AUDREY, ANYWAY?

14:59.667 --> 15:00.542
ANYBODY
TALK TO HER LATELY?

15:00.542 --> 15:02.667
AUDREY'S SINGING BACKUP
FOR JOHN MAYER.

15:02.667 --> 15:06.166
SHE'S TOURING EUROPE,
AND SHE'S GOT SOME BOYFRIEND

15:06.166 --> 15:07.834
SHE CALLS THE ANTI-PACEY.

15:07.834 --> 15:09.875
HE'S TOTALLY BORING AND...

15:09.875 --> 15:11.708
REALLY SWEET OR SOMETHING.

15:11.708 --> 15:15.250
AND "REALLY SWEET,"
AS OPPOSED TO THE ACTUAL PACEY?

15:15.250 --> 15:18.583
AND THAT FROM
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND, NO LESS.

15:18.583 --> 15:23.125
PACEY...THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR REOPENING THIS PLACE.

15:23.125 --> 15:26.458
I DID NOT KNOW
HOW MUCH I MISSED IT.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.458
MAYBE IF YOUR DADDY
HADN'T HAVE BURNED IT DOWN
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

15:28.458 --> 15:29.917
IT'D STILL BE YOURS.

15:29.917 --> 15:32.041
Joey: OHH, NICE,
PACEY. NICE.

15:32.041 --> 15:34.417
I COULDN'T WRITE THIS STUFF
IF I TRIED.

15:34.417 --> 15:35.917
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

15:35.917 --> 15:37.708
NOT LONG ENOUGH,
APPARENTLY.

15:37.708 --> 15:39.917
DAWSON...

15:39.917 --> 15:41.917
REMEMBER WHEN I
DE-VIRGINIZED YOU?

15:41.917 --> 15:43.583
Pacey: WHAT?!

15:43.583 --> 15:46.583
OK, UH, YEAH,
ON THAT NOTE,

15:46.583 --> 15:49.041
MAYBE WE SHOULD DEPART.

15:49.041 --> 15:50.417
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.166
WE'RE JUST GETTING
TO THE GOOD STUFF.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.917
YEAH, I'M AFRAID
SHE'S GONNA DIVULGE
A LITTLE TOO MUCH INFO.

15:53.917 --> 15:54.917
OH, MY GOODNESS.

15:54.917 --> 15:55.917
HERE, I'LL
GIVE YOU A RIDE.

15:55.917 --> 15:58.000
I'M SORRY. OH, NO!

16:00.458 --> 16:02.291
WE'RE OUT.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.583
HEY, GUYS,

16:03.583 --> 16:05.625
REMEMBER THE TIME
WHEN MY BOYFRIEND

16:05.625 --> 16:08.000
KNOCKED ME UP AND LEFT ME
TO RAISE A BABY ON MY OWN?

16:11.250 --> 16:13.625
OK, SEE YOU
AT THE WEDDING.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.667
WAIT, STOP.
ONE MORE THING.

16:15.667 --> 16:18.500
OH, GOD, YOU GUYS
ARE THE BEST FRIENDS
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.667
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

16:21.291 --> 16:22.500
Jen: THAT IS ALL.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.708
GOOD NIGHT.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.625
Jack: WE'LL SEE YOU.

16:27.625 --> 16:29.125
GOOD NIGHT.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.125
GOOD NIGHT.

16:31.125 --> 16:32.792
AND ON THAT NOTE,

16:32.792 --> 16:34.083
GET THE HELL OUT
OF MY RESTAURANT.

16:34.083 --> 16:36.792
I GOTTA CLEAN UP.
YOU GUYS NEED A RIDE?

16:36.792 --> 16:38.291
I'M GONNA WALK.

16:38.291 --> 16:39.458
I CAN DRIVE YOU.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.208
THAT'S OK. IT'S RIGHT
DOWN THE BLOCK.

16:42.208 --> 16:43.667
IT'LL SOBER ME UP.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.000
ALL RIGHT.

16:45.000 --> 16:45.875
GOOD NIGHT, DAWSON.

16:51.291 --> 16:53.041
PACE, THANK YOU.

16:53.041 --> 16:55.000
A PLEASURE,
AS ALWAYS, DARLIN'.

16:57.291 --> 16:58.291
WALK SAFE.

16:58.291 --> 16:59.834
I WILL.

16:59.834 --> 17:01.166
BYE, BOYS.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.666
MY GOD,
THAT WOMAN'S AMAZING.

17:08.666 --> 17:10.834
YEAH.

17:10.834 --> 17:13.000
MAN, THAT GIRL
YOU CAST
ON YOUR SHOW

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
CANNOT HOLD
A CANDLE TO HER.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.834
I KNOW.
I DID NAIL PETEY, THOUGH.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.250
THAT'S PERFECT CASTING.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.040
YEAH, WELL, HE DOES HAVE

17:20.040 --> 17:24.208
THE CERTAIN REQUISITE
ROGUISH CHARM, I GUESS.

17:24.208 --> 17:27.375
WHEW. MAN...

17:27.375 --> 17:28.875
A LOT'S CHANGED.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.917
YOU'VE CHANGED.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.208
YEAH, WELL,
LIFE HAPPENS.

17:35.375 --> 17:37.208
SO, ARE YOU HAPPY?

17:37.208 --> 17:39.542
YOU KNOW, WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED, YOU HAPPY?

17:39.542 --> 17:41.500
THE STOCK ANSWER'S
A RESOUNDING YES.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.917
ANYTHING ELSE,
I'D SOUND LIKE

17:42.917 --> 17:44.583
A WHINY HOLLYWOOD BRAT,
RIGHT?

17:46.208 --> 17:50.417
YEAH, BUT RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.

17:50.417 --> 17:51.542
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

17:51.542 --> 17:53.375
I HAVEN'T GIVEN IT
MUCH THOUGHT.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.000
YOU?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.041
HEH.

17:57.041 --> 18:00.083
UH...

18:00.083 --> 18:02.708
OH, YOU KNOW ME,
I'D BE MISERABLE
IF I WAS HAPPY.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.792
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO HELP ME DO THIS.

18:07.792 --> 18:09.166
IT'S MY JOB, REMEMBER?

18:11.875 --> 18:13.250
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, DAWSON.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.583
YOU, TOO.

18:14.583 --> 18:15.959
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
AT THE WEDDING.

18:15.959 --> 18:16.959
ALL RIGHT.

18:16.959 --> 18:17.917
WELCOME HOME.

18:27.375 --> 18:31.417
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED,
THIS WAS NOT ON THE LIST OF
GODPARENT JOB REQUIREMENTS.

18:31.417 --> 18:32.417
(CRYING)

18:32.417 --> 18:33.750
THAT'S OK, THAT'S OK.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.208
YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.208
IS SHE ALWAYS
THIS SAD NAKED?

18:41.917 --> 18:44.041
WHAT'S THIS?

18:44.041 --> 18:47.583
OH, THEY'RE GRAMS'.
I JUST KEEP IT ON HAND
IN CASE SHE FORGETS IT.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.250
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
STILL ON PAINKILLERS.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.625
SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S IN GOOD HEALTH.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.125
LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING
THAT WAY.

18:55.125 --> 18:57.792
OH, IT'S OK, IT'S OK.

18:57.792 --> 18:59.458
THERE YOU GO.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.291
MMM...

19:01.291 --> 19:04.166
YOU EVER WONDER IF
YOU COULD SURVIVE
WITHOUT HER?

19:04.166 --> 19:06.125
THINK YOU COULD REALLY
DO THIS ALONE?

19:06.125 --> 19:08.125
I USED TO THINK
I COULDN'T,

19:08.125 --> 19:11.417
BUT, UH, REALLY I DON'T
FEEL THAT WAY ANYMORE.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.291
IT'S REALLY WONDERFUL--
PARENTING.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.250
I MEAN, I CAN'T
PROGRAM MY TiVo,

19:21.250 --> 19:23.083
BUT I CAN TAKE CARE
OF A CHILD.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.792
YOU'VE CHANGED THE MOST.

19:29.792 --> 19:32.875
OUT OF ALL OF US.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.834
IF I HAVE,
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ME.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.333
AMY CHANGED ME.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.166
I MEAN, I'M JUST ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.

19:41.250 --> 19:43.083
(SIGHS)

19:44.959 --> 19:47.625
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

19:47.625 --> 19:49.333
I MEAN, WHAT SANE
GAY MAN OF THIS ERA

19:49.333 --> 19:51.625
MOVES BACK TO A SUBURB?

19:51.625 --> 19:53.625
JACK...

19:53.625 --> 19:55.834
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS ABOUT CAPESIDE.

19:55.834 --> 19:56.834
I THINK YOU'RE--

19:56.834 --> 19:58.792
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED
WITH DOUG.

19:58.792 --> 20:00.291
I KNOW.

20:00.291 --> 20:03.041
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE I'M
BACK IN THE CLOSET, JEN.

20:03.041 --> 20:05.208
ALTHOUGH THIS TIME IT'S
NOT EVEN MY CLOSET.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.000
WELL, YOU HAVE
TO GIVE HIM SOME TIME.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.333
WHY SHOULD I?

20:08.333 --> 20:09.250
I MEAN, COME ON,
IT'S NOT MY FAULT

20:09.250 --> 20:11.959
MY BOYFRIEND LIVES BACK
IN THE STONE AGE.

20:11.959 --> 20:14.208
I KNOW,
BUT HE'S SO SCARED.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.708
WHAT'S THERE
TO BE SCARED OF?

20:15.708 --> 20:17.250
OF WHAT'S REAL.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.208
IT TERRIFIES US.
ALL OF US.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.250
AND YOU SAY
THAT I'VE CHANGED.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.542
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:21.542 --> 20:24.667
BUT, I MEAN, I WENT
KICKING AND SCREAMING.

20:24.667 --> 20:27.834
AND IF YOU THINK THAT ANYTHING
OF ANY VALUE IN THIS WORLD

20:27.834 --> 20:30.333
COMES AT AN EASIER PRICE,
YOU'RE WRONG.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.083
YOUR WISE
SAGE SUPERPOWERS

20:34.083 --> 20:36.542
HAVE INCREASED
WITH MOTHERHOOD.

20:36.542 --> 20:40.083
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
TO BUY YOU A CAPE
PRETTY SOON.

20:40.083 --> 20:43.542
YOU CAN BE
MY SIDEKICK, HMM?

20:43.542 --> 20:45.583
MY BOY WONDER.

20:45.583 --> 20:47.250
ANYTIME.

20:55.959 --> 20:57.834
(THUD)

21:05.583 --> 21:07.750
OH! OW!

21:07.750 --> 21:09.583
OW.

21:09.583 --> 21:11.417
YOU SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

21:11.417 --> 21:14.583
THAT'S NOT AS EASY
AS IT ONCE WAS.

21:14.583 --> 21:17.208
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
BROKEN SOMETHING.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.291
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:19.291 --> 21:21.583
WELL, I WAS, UM...

21:21.583 --> 21:24.250
WALKING TO THE B&B,
AND I JUST DECIDED

21:24.250 --> 21:25.458
TO KEEP WALKING.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.750
I HAVEN'T BEEN HOME
FOR SO LONG AND...

21:28.750 --> 21:30.750
DID YOU KNOW THEY PUT UP
A McDONALD'S ON HUDSON?

21:30.750 --> 21:33.125
WE'VE OFFICIALLY
BEEN INVADED, DAWSON.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.000
WE ARE ONE OLD NAVY AWAY
FROM BEING DESTROYED.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.125
ARE YOU OK?

21:37.125 --> 21:40.125
OH, YEAH. I'M FINE.

21:40.125 --> 21:42.959
SO, I, UM...

21:42.959 --> 21:45.250
I KEPT WALKING
AND THEN...

21:45.250 --> 21:46.959
IT WAS TOO LATE
TO RING THE BELL

21:46.959 --> 21:49.667
AND I SAW THE LIGHT ON,
SO I THOUGHT, "WHY NOT?"

21:49.667 --> 21:51.291
WERE YOU SLEEPING?

21:51.291 --> 21:52.500
BECAUSE I CAN LEAVE.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.458
NO, NO.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

21:53.458 --> 21:54.959
WE DIDN'T REALLY GET
MUCH ALONE TIME TONIGHT.

21:54.959 --> 21:56.583
THERE'S SO MUCH I WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT YOU

21:56.583 --> 21:58.625
AND NEW YORK AND...

21:58.625 --> 21:59.708
EVERYTHING.

22:01.625 --> 22:05.291
OW. THAT DID  HURT.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.750
(LAUGHING)

22:07.750 --> 22:09.208
SEE YOU LATER, BOSS.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.166
GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.

22:11.166 --> 22:12.041
GOOD NIGHT.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.291
I'M SORRY.

22:17.291 --> 22:18.458
WE'RE ALL CLOSED UP
FOR THE NIGHT.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.166
OH.

22:25.166 --> 22:28.125
I'M GUESSING
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

22:28.125 --> 22:29.333
(SIGHS)

22:29.333 --> 22:31.333
WELL, IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT...

22:31.333 --> 22:34.458
SLEEPING WITH YOUR WIFE,
MAYBE?

22:34.458 --> 22:35.583
OK, WELL,
I'LL MAKE IT EASY ON YOU.

22:37.458 --> 22:38.542
I DESERVE IT.
DO YOUR WORST.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.125
(FOOTSTEPS)

22:42.125 --> 22:43.500
Pacey: HEH HEH.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.333
OH, NOW, LOOK.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.708
I'VE BEEN DRINKING
A BIT TONIGHT,

22:46.708 --> 22:48.542
SO YOU COULD PROBABLY
TAKE ME OUT ALL BY YOURSELF.

22:48.542 --> 22:51.000
YEAH, WHAT'S
THE FUN IN THAT?

22:53.834 --> 22:54.625
(SIGHS)

22:59.834 --> 23:00.875
AAH!

23:08.250 --> 23:09.375
UNH!

23:19.083 --> 23:22.625
WELL, I MET CHRISTOPHER
WHEN I WAS ASSIGNED
TO PROOF HIS BOOK.

23:22.625 --> 23:24.834
THIS WAS BEFORE
I GOT PROMOTED
TO JUNIOR EDITOR.

23:24.834 --> 23:25.834
OK.

23:25.834 --> 23:27.542
AND WE BICKERED
AND ARGUED SO MUCH

23:27.542 --> 23:29.083
SO WE NATURALLY
STARTED DATING,

23:29.083 --> 23:32.750
AND WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING
EVER SINCE.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.333
IS IT SERIOUS?

23:36.000 --> 23:36.917
UM...

23:39.375 --> 23:41.208
WELL, WE'RE--
WE'RE DEFINITELY...

23:41.208 --> 23:45.417
AT THAT MOMENT WHEN
IT EITHER IS OR ISN'T.

23:45.417 --> 23:47.708
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

23:47.708 --> 23:49.250
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

23:49.250 --> 23:51.417
ANYTHING GOING ON
IN L.A.?

23:51.417 --> 23:52.875
(SIGHS)

23:52.875 --> 23:55.750
I'M ABSOLUTELY,
100%,

23:55.750 --> 23:58.208
INTENSELY COMMITTED
TO MY SHOW...

23:58.208 --> 24:00.208
AND NOTHING ELSE.

24:00.208 --> 24:01.917
WELL...

24:01.917 --> 24:04.500
THAT'S TODAY.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.458
IT'S NOT ALWAYS GONNA
BE LIKE THAT, DAWSON.

24:06.458 --> 24:07.667
I...

24:09.417 --> 24:10.750
I'M NOT COMPLAINING,

24:10.750 --> 24:11.375
BUT...

24:13.458 --> 24:15.083
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE...

24:17.208 --> 24:19.417
"WHAT AM I DOING?"

24:19.417 --> 24:22.667
YOU KNOW, I WANTED
TO BE SPIELBERG.

24:22.667 --> 24:25.959
DREAMS AREN'T PERFECT,
DAWSON.

24:25.959 --> 24:28.458
THEY COME TRUE,
NOT FREE.

24:29.959 --> 24:31.750
NICELY PUT.

24:31.750 --> 24:33.792
SOMEONE FAMOUS SAID IT.

24:33.792 --> 24:35.166
HMM.

24:40.458 --> 24:43.417
I'M JUST SO TIRED.

24:43.417 --> 24:44.959
I'LL GO. I'LL LET YOU
GET SOME SLEEP.

24:44.959 --> 24:47.792
NO, NO. I MEANT JUST
TIRED IN GENERAL.

24:49.542 --> 24:52.417
WELL, I SHOULD GO ANYWAY.

24:52.417 --> 24:54.083
IT'S LATE.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.125
WE HAVE A WEDDING TOMORROW.

24:56.125 --> 24:57.625
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL DRIVE YOU.

25:00.959 --> 25:04.291
(YAWNING)

25:04.291 --> 25:06.834
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
NO, I WON'T.

25:06.834 --> 25:08.500
GO TO SLEEP.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.125
WHAT?

25:10.125 --> 25:13.458
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.
THAT'S YOUR SIDE.
THAT'S MINE.

25:13.458 --> 25:15.333
LIE DOWN
AND GO TO SLEEP.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.625
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

25:16.625 --> 25:18.166
DAWSON, I CAN'T.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.125
HEY, YOU ALREADY CLIMBED
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

25:20.125 --> 25:22.000
IT'S ONLY FITTING,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

25:23.834 --> 25:25.667
NO ONE'S PINING AWAY
FOR EACH OTHER

25:25.667 --> 25:26.834
OR MASKING
THEIR FEELINGS.

25:26.834 --> 25:28.500
SO, JUST SLEEP
FOR SLEEP'S SAKE.

25:30.291 --> 25:32.166
WORKS FOR ME.

25:32.166 --> 25:34.125
WE ARE ADULTS.

25:49.959 --> 25:51.000
(SIGHS)

25:54.333 --> 25:55.708
GOOD NIGHT, DAWSON.

25:55.708 --> 25:57.500
GOOD NIGHT, JOEY.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.500
(SIGHS)

26:18.542 --> 26:20.542
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH, DAWSON.

26:20.542 --> 26:24.875
SO MANY GOOD TIMES
AND BAD.

26:24.875 --> 26:28.250
WHEN I LOVED YOU,
YOU LOVED JEN.

26:28.250 --> 26:31.708
AND WHEN YOU LOVED ME,
I NEEDED TO BE ON MY OWN.

26:31.708 --> 26:34.708
SO, I LEFT YOU FOR JACK,

26:34.708 --> 26:37.291
AND THEN HE REALIZED
HE WAS GAY.

26:37.291 --> 26:38.250
AND THEN I CONVINCED YOU

26:38.250 --> 26:40.250
TO TURN YOUR DAD IN
FOR TRAFFICKING COCAINE

26:40.250 --> 26:43.917
AND...YOU SAID YOU'D
NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

26:43.917 --> 26:45.542
BUT I DID.

26:45.542 --> 26:48.291
I OFFERED MYSELF
TO YOU AT THAT PARTY

26:48.291 --> 26:50.083
AFTER YOU CRASHED
YOUR DAD'S BOAT.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.458
AND I REFUSED...

26:52.458 --> 26:54.542
FOR SOME REASON.

26:54.542 --> 26:56.208
AND SO
YOU FELL FOR PACEY.

26:56.208 --> 26:58.458
AND YEARS PASSED...

26:58.458 --> 27:00.917
UNTIL FINALLY
HERE WE ARE...

27:00.917 --> 27:03.500
SAYING, "I DO."

27:03.500 --> 27:05.291
THE WAY IT SHOULD BE...

27:05.291 --> 27:08.458
THE ONLY WAY IT CAN BE
FOR STAR-CROSSED,

27:08.458 --> 27:10.917
ILL-FATED SOUL MATES.

27:12.750 --> 27:14.625
SO, I DO.

27:14.625 --> 27:16.333
I DO, TOO.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.000
Dawson: CUT!

27:46.417 --> 27:47.250
(SIGHS)

27:56.208 --> 28:00.000
HEY, I BOOKED US A ROOM
FOR NEXT WEEKEND

28:00.000 --> 28:01.708
AT STONYBROOK LODGE.

28:01.708 --> 28:04.458
YOU KNOW, I FIGURED
WE COULD DO A LITTLE HIKING,

28:04.458 --> 28:05.875
SOME MOUNTAIN BIKING,
AND, YOU KNOW,

28:05.875 --> 28:08.708
OTHER VARIOUS ACTIVITIES.

28:10.625 --> 28:12.750
DON'T LOOK SO EXCITED.

28:14.667 --> 28:16.166
I--I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

28:16.166 --> 28:17.542
DO YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW,

28:17.542 --> 28:20.375
ANOTHER WEEKEND AWAY
FROM CAPESIDE?

28:20.375 --> 28:23.000
OH, I'M SORRY I MADE
THE MISTAKE OF PLANNING
SOMETHING NICE FOR US.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.500
NO, I APPRECIATE IT.
I DO.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.625
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST

28:25.625 --> 28:26.667
I'D LIKE IT
A LITTLE BIT BETTER

28:26.667 --> 28:28.166
IF WE WERE
HANGING OUT HERE.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.417
LOOK, YOU KNEW
WHEN WE STARTED
SEEING EACH OTHER

28:29.417 --> 28:31.542
THAT I WASN'T READY
FOR ALL OF CAPESIDE
TO KNOW MY BUSINESS.

28:31.542 --> 28:33.542
DOUG, THAT WAS
6 MONTHS AGO.

28:33.542 --> 28:36.542
YOU KNOW, WE DO
LIVE IN A POST-
WILL & GRACE  WORLD.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.500
I MEAN, DO YOU REALLY
THINK PEOPLE STILL CARE
WHO YOU SLEEP WITH?

28:38.500 --> 28:41.041
YEAH. YEAH, I DO.

28:41.041 --> 28:42.750
WHY DO YOU EVEN
CARE WHAT ANYBODY
THINKS ANYWAY?

28:42.750 --> 28:43.750
I MEAN,
YOUR FAMILY KNOWS.

28:43.750 --> 28:44.792
THEY HAVE
NO PROBLEM WITH IT.

28:44.792 --> 28:45.917
PACEY,
HE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

28:45.917 --> 28:47.875
THAT'S BECAUSE PACEY
GETS THE LAST LAUGH.

28:47.875 --> 28:49.250
NO, IT'S BECAUSE
PACEY LOVES YOU,

28:49.250 --> 28:51.375
AND SO DO I.

28:51.375 --> 28:53.375
DOUG, THIS REALLY
SUCKS THAT WE HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS.

28:53.375 --> 28:54.542
I MEAN, HOW MANY
WEEKENDS AWAY

28:54.542 --> 28:55.542
ARE WE GONNA HAVE
TO GO ON

28:55.542 --> 28:58.542
BEFORE WE CAN
BE TOGETHER LIKE
A NORMAL COUPLE?

28:58.542 --> 29:00.542
IT'S LIKE WE'RE HAVING
SOME KIND OF AFFAIR,

29:00.542 --> 29:02.250
YET NEITHER ONE OF US
ARE EVEN MARRIED.

29:02.250 --> 29:04.834
NOT ALL OF US
WERE FAGS AT 15, JACK.

29:04.834 --> 29:06.834
IT'S NOT SO EASY
FOR SOME OF US.

29:11.375 --> 29:14.417
I--I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAID THAT.

29:14.417 --> 29:16.500
I'M--I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T--

29:16.500 --> 29:17.792
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

29:17.792 --> 29:18.417
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE DIFFERENCE IS

29:18.417 --> 29:20.417
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
DOUG?

29:20.417 --> 29:23.917
YOU WERE A FAG AT 15.

29:23.917 --> 29:25.792
YOU JUST HAVEN'T STOPPED
HATING YOURSELF FOR IT.

29:38.708 --> 29:40.583
(CHUCKLES)

29:40.583 --> 29:42.834
(APPLAUSE)

29:51.458 --> 29:53.333
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.250
AND DAD WOULD BE TOO.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.583
THANKS, HONEY.

30:10.625 --> 30:12.834
(MOUTHING)

30:20.792 --> 30:22.125
HEY...

30:22.125 --> 30:23.125
OOP...

30:23.125 --> 30:24.834
WHAT ARE YOU TAKING?

30:24.834 --> 30:26.458
OH, YOU CAUGHT ME.
I'M MEDICATING.

30:26.458 --> 30:29.375
I'M AN ANXIETY-RIDDEN MOTHER.
THEY HELP.

30:31.291 --> 30:32.750
THANK YOU.

30:32.750 --> 30:35.375
YOU, UH...MIND SHARING?

30:35.375 --> 30:37.375
'CAUSE I COULD REALLY
USE IT TODAY.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.041
OH, NO.

30:39.041 --> 30:40.000
OH, YES.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.917
OH...

30:58.333 --> 31:00.750
SO, ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME
HOW YOU GOT THAT SHINER,

31:00.750 --> 31:04.166
OR AM I GONNA HAVE TO ASSUME
YOU BEAT UP THE PRIEST
BEFORE THE CEREMONY?

31:04.166 --> 31:05.917
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
MISTAKES WERE MADE.

31:08.500 --> 31:12.291
WHAT'S GOING ON, PACE?

31:12.291 --> 31:14.166
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:14.166 --> 31:17.667
WHAT'S GOING ON IS
THAT I FORGET HOW MUCH FUN
I HAVE WHEN I'M WITH YOU,

31:17.667 --> 31:19.959
AND IT'S REALLY, REALLY NICE
TO BE REMINDED.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.917
HEY. LET'S SWITCH.
DAWSON WON'T LET ME LEAD.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.542
Pacey: OK.

31:26.542 --> 31:28.125
HEY.
HEY.

31:30.875 --> 31:34.000
YOU LEFT IN A HURRY
THIS MORNING.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.542
YEAH. WELL, I HAD
TO GET READY.

31:37.542 --> 31:43.000
PLUS YOU WERE SNORING,
PLUS THE DEJA VU THING
WAS KINDA HARD TO TAKE.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.375
I MEAN, IT WAS KINDA
LIKE AN ACID FLASHBACK

31:44.375 --> 31:45.458
WITHOUT ALL THE COLORS
AND STUFF.

31:45.458 --> 31:47.166
I MEAN, I GUESS.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.708
NOT LIKE I'VE ACTUALLY
EVER DONE ACID.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.375
I'M GLAD YOU'RE NERVOUS, TOO.

31:51.375 --> 31:53.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:53.000 --> 31:53.959
YOU RAMBLE
WHEN YOU'RE NERVOUS.

31:55.875 --> 31:58.417
IS THIS RAG ON
JOEY POTTER DAY?

31:58.417 --> 32:00.583
I LIKE THAT YOU RAMBLE
WHEN YOU'RE NERVOUS.

32:00.583 --> 32:03.125
I LIKE THAT I KNOW
THAT YOU RAMBLE
WHEN YOU'RE NERVOUS.

32:03.125 --> 32:05.333
I LIKE THAT I STILL
MAKE YOU NERVOUS.

32:09.792 --> 32:11.208
(LAUGHING)
PACEY'S STEPPING
ON MY TOES.

32:11.208 --> 32:13.500
WOULD YOU TAKE HIM
BACK, PLEASE?

32:13.500 --> 32:14.708
IT'S A CONSPIRACY.

32:14.708 --> 32:16.083
NEW SHOES, I THINK.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.250
NEW SHOES.
MUST BE THE NEW SHOES.

32:30.708 --> 32:31.917
AHEM.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.750
PACEY, I THINK
WE HAVE AN AUDIENCE.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.792
OH, BOY...

32:41.792 --> 32:44.333
NICE TO SEE SOME THINGS
NEVER CHANGE.

32:44.333 --> 32:45.750
STILL BREAKING HEARTS?

32:45.750 --> 32:48.166
YEAH.
HER HEART, MY JAW.

32:50.125 --> 32:52.000
IT'S ALL STARTING
TO MAKE SENSE.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.500
DO YOU WANT TO
HELP ME OUT HERE?

32:58.500 --> 32:59.583
HOW?

33:19.458 --> 33:20.750
THANKS.

33:25.834 --> 33:28.375
Dawson:
WHOA, WHOA, JEN.

33:28.375 --> 33:29.667
WE WERE DANCING.
SHE JUST COLLAPSED.

33:29.667 --> 33:30.667
JEN!

33:32.500 --> 33:34.458
MY GOD.
SOMEBODY GET HER BAG.

33:34.458 --> 33:35.708
'CAUSE SHE NEEDS HER PILLS.

33:35.708 --> 33:36.959
I JUST SAW HER
TAKE ONE.

33:36.959 --> 33:40.125
OH. DEAR LORD, THIS
SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.

33:40.125 --> 33:42.125
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HURRY UP,
GET AN AMBULANCE.

33:42.125 --> 33:43.458
OK. WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER?

33:43.458 --> 33:44.750
FOR GOD'S SAKE, HURRY UP.

33:44.750 --> 33:46.208
SHE NEEDS TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL NOW!

33:46.208 --> 33:47.542
GRAMS, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

33:47.542 --> 33:48.333
Grams: SHE'S SICK.

33:48.333 --> 33:49.959
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SICK?
SHE WAS FINE.

33:49.959 --> 33:52.041
SHE'S NOT FINE.
SHE'S VERY SICK.

33:52.041 --> 33:56.250
IT'S HER HEART.
OH, DEAR GOD.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.458
MY BABY JEN.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.333
OH, JEN.

34:25.917 --> 34:27.375
IT'S BEEN HOURS.
WHY WON'T THEY TALK TO US?

34:27.375 --> 34:28.708
WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:28.708 --> 34:30.542
WELL, THEY'RE
MONITORING HER.

34:30.542 --> 34:32.542
HER VITALS HAVE
BEEN COMPROMISED.

34:32.542 --> 34:35.708
AND, UH, THEY NEED
TO CONFER WITH HER
NEW YORK DOCTORS

34:35.708 --> 34:37.208
BEFORE THEY CAN
TELL US ANYTHING.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.333
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER?

34:38.333 --> 34:39.542
YOU KNOW,
DON'T YOU?

34:42.375 --> 34:46.417
IT'S A SMALL PROBLEM, REALLY.
IT-IT'S BEEN THERE ALL ALONG.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.958
W-WE JUST DIDN'T NOTICE IT
UNTIL THE PREGNANCY.

34:48.958 --> 34:51.917
THERE'S AN ABNORMALITY
IN HER HEART,

34:51.917 --> 34:54.125
WHICH IS WHY SHE FAINTED.

34:54.125 --> 34:57.125
IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS,
REALLY.

34:57.125 --> 35:00.417
I MEAN SHE'LL BE MORE
EMBARRASSED THAN ANYTHING ELSE
WHEN SHE WAKES UP.

35:00.417 --> 35:01.792
REALLY?

35:01.792 --> 35:03.458
YES, REALLY.

35:11.083 --> 35:12.708
JACK, DID YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

35:14.792 --> 35:16.208
NO.

35:16.208 --> 35:19.041
WHAT IS A HEART ABNORMALITY?

35:19.041 --> 35:20.917
IS THAT LIKE A MURMUR
OR SOMETHING?

35:20.917 --> 35:23.208
'CAUSE I DON'T MEAN
TO BE AN ALARMIST, BUT THAT
SOUNDS SERIOUS TO ME.

35:25.458 --> 35:29.625
ALL RIGHT.
SHE'S STABLE.

35:29.625 --> 35:33.750
SHE FAINTED FROM
A PALPITATION CAUSED
BY HER MEDICATION.

35:33.750 --> 35:36.291
WE WON'T KNOW
ANYTHING MORE FOR NOW.

35:36.291 --> 35:39.625
UM, SO THERE'S NOTHING
MUCH ELSE TO BE DONE...

35:39.625 --> 35:42.667
AT THE MOMENT.

35:42.667 --> 35:45.291
LOOK, I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD ALL JUST
GO HOME AND REST.

35:45.291 --> 35:49.125
IT'S BEEN...DRAMATIC,
AND I--I...

35:49.125 --> 35:51.834
PLEASE JUST--
JUST GO NOW.

35:51.834 --> 35:53.458
IS SHE GONNA BE OK?

35:53.458 --> 35:55.792
OF COURSE SHE'S
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

35:55.792 --> 35:58.583
HER MOTHER'S IN EUROPE.
I, UH...

35:58.583 --> 36:00.792
I REALLY NEED T-TO CALL
AND...

36:00.792 --> 36:02.333
EXCUSE ME.

36:15.667 --> 36:16.959
I'M WORRIED.

36:16.959 --> 36:18.333
Joey:
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

36:18.333 --> 36:20.792
WH...
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.
RIGHT?

36:20.792 --> 36:22.667
I MEAN WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
LET'S NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.

36:22.667 --> 36:25.667
YEAH. AND SHE'S YOUNG.
SHE'S HEALTHY.

36:25.667 --> 36:27.333
BEST THING WE CAN DO IS
JUST BE OURSELVES--

36:27.333 --> 36:29.834
CARRY ON IN OUR TYPICAL,
USUAL, DISTRACTING...

36:29.834 --> 36:31.625
SORDID
LOVE TRIANGLE WAYS.

36:31.625 --> 36:34.625
(GUFFAWS)

36:34.625 --> 36:38.000
LEAVE IT UP TO YOU TO SAY
THE MOST INAPPROPRIATE
THING POSSIBLE.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.542
AW, I'M ALWAYS
DEPENDABLE,
MY FRIEND.

36:39.542 --> 36:40.583
SO VERY NOT FUNNY.

36:46.875 --> 36:48.333
HI, CHRISTOPHER.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.333
AND THE TRIANGLE
BECOMES A SQUARE.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.917
WELL PUT.

37:30.917 --> 37:31.625
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

37:38.375 --> 37:39.625
HEY YOU.

37:39.625 --> 37:40.792
HEY.

37:43.583 --> 37:45.208
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
IT'S LATE.

37:45.208 --> 37:48.000
DOESN'T THIS HOSPITAL
HAVE VISITATION HOURS?

37:51.583 --> 37:53.959
I, UH...

37:53.959 --> 37:57.000
FLIRTED WITH A NURSE.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.417
QUITE CHARMING
WHEN I WANNA BE.

37:59.417 --> 38:01.917
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SHE
FINDS OUT YOU'RE GAY?

38:01.917 --> 38:02.792
IT'S A MALE NURSE.

38:05.125 --> 38:06.208
CUTE?

38:07.750 --> 38:09.417
LOOK, JEN...

38:12.583 --> 38:15.625
I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE
THAN TO ENGAGE

38:15.625 --> 38:21.291
IN OUR PATENTED, MEANINGLESS,
GOOD-HUMORED JACK-JEN
FAG-HAG BANTER, BUT...

38:21.291 --> 38:25.792
FIRST I WAS KINDA WONDERING,
I MEAN, SINCE YOU'RE LYING HERE
IN THIS HOSPITAL BED

38:25.792 --> 38:29.041
AND YOU'RE HOOKED UP
TO ALL THESE MACHINES...

38:30.959 --> 38:33.083
HOW COME?

38:33.083 --> 38:36.834
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
'CAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS
YOUR BEST FRIEND?

38:36.834 --> 38:40.166
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO BE WORRIED.

38:42.750 --> 38:45.417
I WAS ALREADY
WORRYING ENOUGH.

38:45.417 --> 38:50.125
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IF I
PRETENDED IT DIDN'T EXIST,

38:50.125 --> 38:52.166
IT WOULD JUST GO AWAY.

38:54.125 --> 38:55.625
BECAUSE I LIKE IT.

38:55.625 --> 39:02.417
I LIKE OUR PATENTED,
MEANINGLESS,
FAG-HAG BANTER,

39:02.417 --> 39:05.625
AND 'CAUSE I WAS SCARED
IF I SAID IT OUT LOUD,

39:05.625 --> 39:10.166
IT WOULD BE TRUE
BECAUSE I WAS JUST--
I WAS JUST SCARED.

39:10.166 --> 39:11.375
'CAUSE I WAS AN IDIOT.

39:11.375 --> 39:13.000
YOU ARE AN IDIOT.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.625
I--I COULD'VE HANDLED IT.
I COULD'VE HELPED YOU
HANDLE IT.

39:16.625 --> 39:18.583
WELL, YOU WILL HELP ME
HANDLE IT.

39:22.542 --> 39:24.000
I NEED YOU.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.583
JEN, STRAIGHT UP.

39:27.542 --> 39:29.500
HOW BAD IS IT?

39:29.500 --> 39:35.834
DECREASED LEFT
VENTRICULAR-SYSTOLIC
FUNCTION.

39:35.834 --> 39:40.667
IT'S A WHOLE
BLOOD NOT PUMPING RIGHT
TO MY HEART.

39:40.667 --> 39:44.583
AND IT'S CAUSING A LOT
OF PROBLEMS IN MY LUNGS.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.542
IT'S CALLED
PULMONARY CONGESTION.

39:48.625 --> 39:50.834
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
DO WE DO ABOUT IT?

39:50.834 --> 39:54.041
I MEAN, WHAT--SURGERY?

39:54.041 --> 39:54.750
TREATMENT? WHAT?

39:54.750 --> 39:56.500
NOTHING.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.834
I HAVE BEEN DOING
EVERYTHING.

40:00.041 --> 40:02.250
AND AT FIRST,
THE ODDS WERE GOOD.

40:04.583 --> 40:05.458
BUT...

40:07.208 --> 40:09.542
YOU KNOW ME AND ODDS.

40:09.542 --> 40:12.375
JEN, THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

40:12.375 --> 40:14.166
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT
A SPECIALIST?

40:14.166 --> 40:15.667
I'VE BEEN THERE,
REPEATEDLY.

40:17.667 --> 40:19.875
I'M SO SORRY LAYING THIS
ALL ON YOU LIKE THIS.

40:19.875 --> 40:22.750
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT
I'D MAKE IT TO CAPESIDE
AND BACK IN ONE PIECE.

40:22.750 --> 40:24.583
YEAH. YEAH.

40:27.250 --> 40:30.458
BEEN TRYING TO GET OK
WITH THIS, BUT I CAN'T
DO IT ALONE ANYMORE.

40:35.083 --> 40:37.000
'CAUSE I AM GONNA DIE,
JACK.

40:40.625 --> 40:44.083
AND LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
IN MY LIFE, I DON'T REALLY
KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

40:44.083 --> 40:48.708
BUT I'D LIKE TO NOT
SCREW IT UP.

40:48.708 --> 40:51.125
I'D LIKE IT TO BE
SOMETHING I GET RIGHT
FOR ONCE.

40:51.125 --> 40:53.583
I'M HERE.

40:53.583 --> 40:56.250
I WILL DO ANYTHING
THAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.750
RIGHT NOW...

40:57.750 --> 41:01.625
I WANT YOU TO GET
IN BED WITH ME

41:01.625 --> 41:03.625
AND TELL ME ALL
ABOUT THIS CUTE NURSE

41:03.625 --> 41:05.959
AND MAKE ME FORGET
EVERYTHING THAT I
JUST TOLD YOU.

41:05.959 --> 41:06.625
YEAH.
COME HERE.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.625
YEAH. COME HERE.

41:14.625 --> 41:15.625
IT'S OK.

41:17.417 --> 41:18.625
NOW TELL.

41:21.458 --> 41:23.792
(CRYING)
HIS NAME'S MAX.

41:23.792 --> 41:24.959
MM...

41:24.959 --> 41:26.250
I LIKE MAX.

41:27.959 --> 41:29.792
HE HAS A GOATEE.

41:29.792 --> 41:31.583
HMM.

41:33.959 --> 41:35.375
WE COULD WORK ON THAT.
