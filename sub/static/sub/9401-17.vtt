00:00.688 --> 00:03.310
Alex has to be better, or we're
gonna be in serious trouble here.

00:03.435 --> 00:04.253
She will be.

00:04.378 --> 00:07.235
I'm letting everyone down, and
I don't get drunk when I'm sad.

00:07.360 --> 00:08.576
I sleep with boys.

00:08.701 --> 00:09.677
You want to get out of here?

00:09.802 --> 00:11.078
My name is Millicent.

00:11.203 --> 00:13.647
I keep telling everybody I'm fine,

00:13.772 --> 00:15.249
and I'm not fine.

00:15.374 --> 00:16.983
So, let me get this straight.

00:17.108 --> 00:18.918
You don't want to make a record
because it's too personal?

00:19.043 --> 00:21.387
- That's right.
- Personal sells albums.

00:21.512 --> 00:22.288
So, make a record with me.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.776
I loved you so much, Sara.

00:24.901 --> 00:28.537
You were perfect with me...
and you always will be.

00:30.232 --> 00:31.099
Are you okay, mom?

00:31.224 --> 00:32.383
I have cancer.

00:32.508 --> 00:35.049
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's pancreatic.

00:35.174 --> 00:36.745
So I've accepted it.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.027
You're giving up.

00:38.152 --> 00:39.691
No, I am not giving up.

00:39.816 --> 00:41.174
Maybe Quinn can take a picture of it.

00:41.299 --> 00:42.667
We can just add it to this stupid box.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.194
Taylor. Tay.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.193
I, uh, know that we haven't had

01:19.318 --> 01:20.260
a family breakfast in a long time,

01:20.478 --> 01:22.330
but, um, I seem to remember

01:22.455 --> 01:25.011
that there used to be
at least some talking

01:25.136 --> 01:26.687
and, uh, you know, eating

01:26.812 --> 01:28.697
the last few times we've done this.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.169
I don't know. Call me crazy.

01:30.294 --> 01:31.644
I'm sorry, mom. It's
just hard for us to...

01:31.769 --> 01:34.591
I know, honey, but...

01:34.716 --> 01:36.362
I just want to enjoy a breakfast

01:36.487 --> 01:38.271
with my favorite people in the world.

01:38.396 --> 01:40.583
Okay?

01:40.708 --> 01:42.758
Okay.

01:42.883 --> 01:44.019
Good.

01:45.224 --> 01:47.241
There he is.

01:47.366 --> 01:50.522
Finally, someone with a personality.

01:50.647 --> 01:51.860
Ahh!

01:51.985 --> 01:53.600
So, what's for breakfast?

01:53.725 --> 01:55.775
For you, a little bit of everything.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.536
Ooh, my favorite.

02:01.584 --> 02:03.490
What's everyone staring at?

02:05.532 --> 02:08.820
I think it's because that
was the last piece of bacon.

02:08.945 --> 02:12.330
But don't you worry about
it. They had their chance.

02:12.455 --> 02:15.573
Come with me. I want to
show you something, okay?

02:15.698 --> 02:18.083
I would like to thank all of you

02:18.208 --> 02:21.394
for this scintillating
breakfast conversation.

02:21.519 --> 02:23.300
You know, it's moments like these

02:23.425 --> 02:25.899
that we're supposed to remember.

02:37.901 --> 02:39.446
Hey, come back to bed.

02:39.571 --> 02:41.385
Why are you still here?

02:41.510 --> 02:43.491
Ouch. Well, someone's a little feisty.

02:43.616 --> 02:45.329
I like it.

02:45.454 --> 02:47.771
You know, to be honest, we could've
used a little more of that last night.

02:47.896 --> 02:49.709
What's that supposed to mean?

02:49.834 --> 02:51.781
Well, you got to admit,
I did most of the work.

02:51.906 --> 02:53.618
It's okay, though.

02:53.743 --> 02:55.590
I mean, I slept like a baby.

02:55.715 --> 02:58.264
Good for you. You know who
didn't sleep like a baby? Me.

02:58.389 --> 03:00.103
I got exactly 26 minutes of sleep,

03:00.228 --> 03:01.941
and I'm filming eight scenes today.

03:02.066 --> 03:04.646
Well, I refuse to apologize
for my exceptional stamina.

03:04.771 --> 03:07.955
I'm not talking about that!
I'm talking about that.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.424
The horrible noise.

03:09.549 --> 03:11.396
I think it's called music.

03:11.521 --> 03:14.403
No, when it comes
through a hotel-room wall,

03:14.528 --> 03:16.608
it's called noise.

03:16.733 --> 03:18.982
So, you're not coming back to bed?

03:19.107 --> 03:21.722
Let me try to explain this to you.

03:21.847 --> 03:23.324
I'm filming a movie right now,

03:23.449 --> 03:25.229
so I need this thing called sleep.

03:25.354 --> 03:28.069
And when I don't get sleep,
I get bags under my eyes.

03:28.194 --> 03:31.309
- And those bags are gonna be
documented on film forever.
- Yeah.

03:31.434 --> 03:32.813
- Got it?
- Got it.

03:32.938 --> 03:34.785
Hey, well, look on the bright side.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.424
I mean, odds are no one's
even gonna see this film.

03:37.549 --> 03:40.822
Seriously, why are you still here?

03:45.834 --> 03:47.781
Have I been replaced already?

03:47.906 --> 03:49.350
What?

03:49.475 --> 03:51.120
You're sitting in my chair.

03:51.245 --> 03:52.991
Oh.

03:53.116 --> 03:54.694
I'm sorry. I thought you...

03:54.819 --> 03:57.624
No, no. Just a poorly timed joke.

03:59.129 --> 04:00.507
You're here early.

04:00.632 --> 04:02.311
Oh, I know. I couldn't sleep.

04:02.436 --> 04:03.948
So... figured I'd come in

04:04.073 --> 04:05.217
and try to steal your job.

04:05.342 --> 04:07.421
Um...

04:07.546 --> 04:09.358
Can I ask you something

04:09.483 --> 04:11.629
I'm not really allowed to ask anyone else?

04:11.754 --> 04:13.733
Of course.

04:13.858 --> 04:15.838
Am I doing okay?

04:15.963 --> 04:18.106
Are you kidding?

04:18.231 --> 04:20.140
You're doing great.

04:20.265 --> 04:23.265
Everyone is so proud of you,
especially your dad and...

04:24.933 --> 04:26.500
and me.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.211
I do have one major complaint, though.

04:30.336 --> 04:32.278
You need to start dressing warmer.

04:32.403 --> 04:34.680
'Cause if you don't,
you're gonna get sick,

04:34.805 --> 04:37.015
and then you'll get all
sluggish like you do,

04:37.140 --> 04:39.283
and then you'll grouch
and you'll whine a little,

04:39.408 --> 04:40.618
and nobody wants that.

04:40.743 --> 04:41.751
I don't grouch.

04:41.876 --> 04:43.553
Yes, you do. And whine.

04:43.678 --> 04:45.054
I do whine.

04:45.179 --> 04:46.455
A little.

04:46.580 --> 04:47.814
Yeah.

04:51.251 --> 04:55.030
Okay, well, you probably have
a million fires to put out,

04:55.155 --> 04:57.499
so I'm gonna get out of your way.

04:57.624 --> 05:00.267
Thanks for letting me sit in your chair.

05:00.392 --> 05:02.059
Anytime.

05:20.844 --> 05:22.921
You okay?

05:23.046 --> 05:24.522
No, I'm not.

05:24.647 --> 05:26.224
She's acting like there's nothing wrong,

05:26.349 --> 05:27.725
like she's fine.

05:27.850 --> 05:30.193
She's just trying to be
strong for everyone, Haley.

05:30.318 --> 05:32.262
By giving up?

05:32.387 --> 05:34.864
No. By accepting the
situation that she's in.

05:34.989 --> 05:37.199
- She seems at peace with it.
- Well, I'm not.

05:37.324 --> 05:38.433
It's not over. She's still here.

05:38.558 --> 05:40.034
I'm not ready to let her stop fighting.

05:40.159 --> 05:42.236
Haley, I know this is
hard, but this is her life,

05:42.361 --> 05:44.872
and the doctors told her she
doesn't have much time left.

05:44.997 --> 05:48.007
So, let's get a second
opinion or third or fourth.

05:48.132 --> 05:49.509
And what happens if
they say the same thing?

05:49.634 --> 05:51.711
- What if they don't?
- Haley.

05:51.836 --> 05:55.647
What? I... I have to believe
in something right now,

05:55.772 --> 05:58.883
because without hope, I
wouldn't be able to breathe.

05:59.008 --> 06:01.118
So, just let me have that, okay?

06:01.243 --> 06:03.954
If we can't find someone to help her,

06:04.079 --> 06:06.789
then at least I'll know
we did everything we could.

06:06.914 --> 06:10.459
But until we know for sure, I
just... I... I need that hope.

06:10.584 --> 06:12.418
Okay.

06:17.756 --> 06:19.965
Just a few months ago,

06:20.090 --> 06:23.534
I had everything I ever wanted.

06:23.659 --> 06:27.171
But now all that seems like forever ago,

06:27.296 --> 06:29.339
because, one day, I lost my way,

06:29.464 --> 06:32.475
and I forgot who I was.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.668
But I'm trying to find my way back.

06:36.970 --> 06:39.138
I just hope I can get there someday.

06:42.709 --> 06:43.875
Thanks.

06:55.586 --> 06:59.365
Do you recognize this handsome guy?

06:59.490 --> 07:01.867
That's you Christmas morning.

07:01.992 --> 07:03.933
Look how little you were.

07:04.058 --> 07:06.468
Yeah. I was a kid back then.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.003
Look, that's when I got Fletcher.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.971
He was my favorite stuffed animal.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.872
Do you still have Fletcher?

07:11.997 --> 07:13.040
Somewhere.

07:13.165 --> 07:15.108
Chester chewed his head off once.

07:15.233 --> 07:16.576
Mom sewed it back on.

07:16.701 --> 07:18.978
And he kind of looks weird now.

07:19.103 --> 07:23.482
This was my favorite Christmas.

07:23.607 --> 07:25.817
I will never forget it.

07:25.942 --> 07:27.986
Because you got lots of good presents?

07:28.111 --> 07:30.521
Well, you could say that.

07:30.646 --> 07:32.756
I was surrounded by family,

07:32.881 --> 07:35.391
by all the people that
I love most in the world.

07:35.516 --> 07:39.093
And that's the best gift
anyone could ever give me.

07:39.218 --> 07:44.965
And I got to spend one last
Christmas with your grandpa.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.201
That was a good day.

07:47.326 --> 07:49.537
He got you Fletcher.

07:49.662 --> 07:54.097
I don't really remember him.

07:55.966 --> 07:59.578
Yeah, well, you were
pretty small when he died.

07:59.703 --> 08:01.713
But, boy...

08:01.838 --> 08:05.683
He loved you so much.

08:05.808 --> 08:07.684
Do you miss him?

08:07.809 --> 08:10.320
Every second of every day.

08:10.445 --> 08:13.122
But you know what I do to remember him?

08:13.247 --> 08:17.559
When I listen to your
mom, I can hear his laugh.

08:17.684 --> 08:23.264
And when I look at your
aunt Quinn, I see his eyes.

08:23.389 --> 08:26.033
And then I look at you,

08:26.158 --> 08:30.294
and I see his beautiful smile.

08:32.196 --> 08:34.496
There it is.

08:38.301 --> 08:40.145
Maybe Christmas this
year will be even better.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.604
I hope so.

08:44.473 --> 08:46.283
But, um...

08:46.408 --> 08:50.453
I'm not gonna be with
you this Christmas, Jamie.

08:50.578 --> 08:52.855
Where will you be?

08:52.980 --> 08:57.383
I'm... going to be with your grandpa.

09:07.073 --> 09:09.016
Recorded a bunch of songs, lost the girl,

09:09.141 --> 09:11.217
and now you're afraid
to make another record.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.418
Is that accurate?

09:12.543 --> 09:13.986
Yep, those are pretty much

09:14.111 --> 09:16.354
the bullet points of my painful existence.

09:16.479 --> 09:17.922
And thank you, by the way,

09:18.047 --> 09:21.491
for reminding me with such
a cold and brief synopsis.

09:21.616 --> 09:23.460
- Can I give you some advice?
- If I say no, will you...

09:23.585 --> 09:24.661
Get over it.

09:24.786 --> 09:26.662
The girl, the big bad record executives

09:26.787 --> 09:30.065
who hurt your feelings...
just get over it.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.334
I wish it were that simple.

09:32.459 --> 09:34.068
So, you're telling me there is no chance

09:34.193 --> 09:35.937
I'm gonna get you to
make a record with us?

09:36.062 --> 09:39.239
- I don't think so.
- Not even 1%?

09:39.364 --> 09:41.641
Well, there's a 1% chance
I'd do anything with you.

09:41.766 --> 09:44.777
Excellent. That's all I need.

09:47.538 --> 09:50.273
Let's negotiate.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.952
You wrote the script, remember?

09:54.077 --> 09:55.253
If it's putting you to sleep,

09:55.378 --> 09:57.188
you have no one to blame but yourself.

09:57.313 --> 09:58.889
I'm sorry. I was up all night.

09:59.014 --> 10:00.124
Who was he?

10:00.249 --> 10:03.182
It wasn't a he. It was a bunch of hes.

10:04.753 --> 10:06.539
Did your mind really just go there?

10:06.799 --> 10:08.882
- No.
- Yeah, right.

10:09.098 --> 10:12.429
There's a convention in town
for patio furniture sales men.

10:12.721 --> 10:14.314
Yes, apparently there are those.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.077
And lucky me, the suite right next to mine

10:16.202 --> 10:18.476
is party central for 200 middle-aged men

10:18.601 --> 10:20.176
who get to be single for a few days.

10:20.301 --> 10:22.774
They haven't stopped
raging since they got here.

10:22.899 --> 10:24.107
Okay, so just switch rooms.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.872
I've tried. The stupid
hotel is completely booked.

10:26.997 --> 10:29.305
I hate patio furniture.

10:29.430 --> 10:30.670
Me too. It always gets so dirty.

10:30.795 --> 10:31.803
Rehearsal's up!

10:31.928 --> 10:33.559
Alex, we have a big day today.

10:34.127 --> 10:37.234
I know. I'll be fine. I
wrote the script, remember?

10:37.359 --> 10:38.300
Good.

10:44.523 --> 10:46.200
Hey.

10:46.325 --> 10:49.235
So, I, uh... I just
spoke with our team doctor.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.201
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

10:51.326 --> 10:54.766
Actually, um, I talked
to him about your mom,

10:54.891 --> 10:56.365
and as it turns out,

10:56.490 --> 10:58.165
he knows one of the best
oncologists in the world,

10:58.290 --> 11:00.631
and he's offered to take
a look at Lydia's case.

11:00.756 --> 11:02.798
That's great.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.030
Haley, I just want to make sure
that you don't get your hopes up...

11:04.155 --> 11:05.254
you don't have to say it.

11:06.421 --> 11:09.129
Just... thank you.

11:09.254 --> 11:11.352
You're welcome.

11:20.718 --> 11:23.491
So, here it is.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.214
Kind of great, huh?

11:27.716 --> 11:28.891
It's perfect.

11:29.016 --> 11:31.656
A little empty.

11:31.781 --> 11:34.789
I'm sorry. That was a stupid joke.

11:34.914 --> 11:38.124
I just wish everything wasn't
so hard with my mom right now.

11:38.249 --> 11:41.223
You know I'm the poster
boy for suffering alone.

11:41.348 --> 11:43.289
But you don't have to.

11:43.414 --> 11:45.088
You know, I'm here.

11:45.213 --> 11:47.587
I know. Thanks.

11:47.712 --> 11:49.020
I'm not avoiding it.

11:49.145 --> 11:51.676
I'm just trying to figure
it all out, you know?

11:53.044 --> 11:55.185
You know, for what it's worth,

11:55.310 --> 11:56.985
you have an opportunity.

11:57.110 --> 11:59.819
You know, you still have
the chance to say goodbye.

11:59.944 --> 12:03.685
I didn't have that with
Sara, and I wish I did.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.985
You know, I wish I had that one moment.

12:06.110 --> 12:07.208
Thanks.

12:08.475 --> 12:10.849
So, when do you leave for
your tennis tournament?

12:10.974 --> 12:12.249
I decided not to go.

12:12.374 --> 12:14.449
I want to stay here with you.

12:14.574 --> 12:15.814
Clay, I love that,

12:15.939 --> 12:17.748
but we both know you're
building something here, okay?

12:17.873 --> 12:19.881
You have a business, and
you have a client list.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.147
It's important, and you have to go.

12:22.272 --> 12:23.679
Stop. It's not an option.

12:23.804 --> 12:24.946
Come on.

12:25.071 --> 12:28.444
I promise, if anything happens,
you'll be my first call.

12:28.569 --> 12:29.577
Go.

12:29.702 --> 12:31.234
Oh.

12:33.301 --> 12:34.943
Okay. First call.

12:35.068 --> 12:36.066
First call.

12:45.164 --> 12:48.506
Hello, Brooke. It's a
lovely day, isn't it?

12:48.631 --> 12:51.740
Oh! You look beautiful!

12:51.865 --> 12:54.574
Mother... you're glowing.

12:54.699 --> 12:56.307
Am I?

12:56.432 --> 12:59.108
Yes. In fact, you've
been glowing for days.

12:59.233 --> 13:01.073
It's getting weird.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.706
Well... I suppose...

13:04.831 --> 13:06.806
it's because I've taken a lover.

13:06.931 --> 13:08.205
Here we go.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.706
Oh, he's a gentle, passionate lover.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.730
Okay, I don't need details. Please.

13:14.431 --> 13:15.972
It's Paul, right?

13:16.097 --> 13:18.373
I've seen you two flirting
with each other on set,

13:18.498 --> 13:20.239
and I just... ugh!

13:20.364 --> 13:22.305
A lady doesn't kiss and tell, honey.

13:22.430 --> 13:24.938
Well, it seems to me like you're
kissing and telling right now.

13:25.063 --> 13:27.871
Well, no. You asked why I
was glowing, so I told you.

13:27.996 --> 13:30.738
You're right. My mistake.

13:30.863 --> 13:33.928
I'm gonna get back to work now

13:34.295 --> 13:39.403
and try to extract a certain
horrifying image from my mind.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.203
Good luck with that. Me?

13:41.328 --> 13:46.866
I'm going to go and try to keep a
certain image very much in my mind.

13:46.991 --> 13:49.664
Gross!

13:49.789 --> 13:52.187
Say hi to gentle Paul for me.

13:53.255 --> 13:55.426
Hey, Millie, wait up.

13:55.551 --> 13:57.758
I got to be honest...

13:57.883 --> 13:59.723
I didn't expect to see
anybody I knew here.

13:59.848 --> 14:01.355
Well, look, if it's weird for you,

14:01.480 --> 14:03.653
we can arrange it so we're
here on separate days.

14:03.778 --> 14:06.456
No. It's...

14:06.581 --> 14:08.991
I should be happy to see you.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.081
It's so hard to get up in
front of bunch of strangers

14:11.206 --> 14:14.683
and explain to them how you made
a complete mess of your life.

14:14.808 --> 14:17.724
Actually, it's comforting to know

14:17.849 --> 14:21.360
that you have someone there listening,

14:21.485 --> 14:24.262
someone who understands
what you're going through.

14:24.387 --> 14:25.630
I'm proud of you

14:25.755 --> 14:27.432
for standing up there
and sharing your story.

14:27.557 --> 14:30.267
Thanks.

14:30.392 --> 14:32.769
I still don't know how I
let it get to this point.

14:32.894 --> 14:35.272
I don't know. It all becomes a blur.

14:35.397 --> 14:40.109
The amazing thing is you realized
that your life was unmanageable.

14:40.234 --> 14:43.979
Just being here is the
biggest step you've ever taken.

14:44.104 --> 14:46.748
Thanks, Owen.

14:46.873 --> 14:49.016
You have no idea how much that helps.

14:49.141 --> 14:50.751
Actually, I do.

14:50.876 --> 14:55.555
Look, you ever need someone
to lean on, you can call me.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.323
I'll be there.

14:57.448 --> 14:59.659
Okay.

15:05.888 --> 15:08.199
Dude, I told you to cover
me with a sniper rifle.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.034
Why are you equipped with an RPD?

15:10.159 --> 15:12.035
Really? I should shut the hell up?

15:12.160 --> 15:15.405
Why don't you take a look at my
kill ratio and see who owns you?

15:15.530 --> 15:16.630
Yeah, that's what I thought.

15:19.933 --> 15:21.176
Who you talking to?

15:21.301 --> 15:22.377
Sorry.

15:22.502 --> 15:24.646
Uh, that was... that was Skills.

15:24.771 --> 15:26.581
Oh.

15:26.706 --> 15:28.483
We, uh... we get a little competitive.

15:28.608 --> 15:30.151
Yeah, no, I can see that.

15:30.276 --> 15:33.421
You think he's checking out
your kill ratio right now?

15:33.546 --> 15:35.589
Yeah, just, uh, pretend
you didn't hear that.

15:35.714 --> 15:38.091
Um, thanks for picking
up lunch, by the way.

15:38.216 --> 15:40.660
Sure.

15:40.785 --> 15:43.529
- How's he doing?
- He's good.

15:43.654 --> 15:46.130
I mean, he's not good at
this game, obviously, but...

15:46.255 --> 15:47.798
wait, are you two not talking?

15:47.923 --> 15:49.132
Yeah, not so much.

15:49.257 --> 15:51.600
And when we do talk,
it's not really the same.

15:51.725 --> 15:53.601
But, I mean, that's okay.

15:53.726 --> 15:55.803
Guess it's only natural
we'd drift apart, right?

15:55.928 --> 15:57.504
Distance is hard.

15:57.629 --> 15:59.372
It's all hard. I mean,
look at me and Millie.

15:59.497 --> 16:02.008
We live together, but
she feels so far away.

16:02.133 --> 16:04.543
I mean, I felt closer
when I lived in Omaha.

16:04.668 --> 16:06.211
Maybe you're right.

16:06.336 --> 16:09.848
It's just, the idea of starting
over sounds so scary to me.

16:09.973 --> 16:12.584
I will probably just stop dating.

16:12.709 --> 16:14.985
I had a date the other night.

16:15.110 --> 16:16.687
- Really?
- Yeah. It was bizarre.

16:16.812 --> 16:19.289
It was like this weird kind of '80s movie.

16:19.414 --> 16:21.191
But I don't know. She was cool.

16:21.316 --> 16:23.092
She even wants to go out again,

16:23.217 --> 16:25.594
but it just doesn't feel
right because of Millie.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.296
That's understandable.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.597
You know what?

16:28.722 --> 16:30.365
When you're ready, you'll just know.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.401
And until then, you do have that
pretty impressive kill ratio.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.474
Hey, buddy. Where's grandma?

16:40.599 --> 16:42.943
She's resting.

16:43.068 --> 16:45.946
You doing okay what's wrong?

16:46.071 --> 16:48.472
I don't want grandma to die.

17:09.191 --> 17:10.967
- Are you stalking me now?
- Relax.

17:11.092 --> 17:13.301
Brooke needed me here to do
some adjustments to the wardrobe.

17:13.426 --> 17:16.107
I'm here strictly on business.

17:16.232 --> 17:18.641
Unless, of course, you want
to go play in your trailer.

17:18.766 --> 17:21.300
Nothing sounds worse to me right now.

17:28.273 --> 17:30.975
Actually, I take that back.

17:55.127 --> 17:58.104
Did you see Brooke Davis's mom?

17:58.229 --> 17:59.839
I would totally hit that.

17:59.964 --> 18:01.340
I'm not even kidding.

18:01.465 --> 18:03.876
Right now, today, I would hit that.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.344
That is so sweet.

18:05.469 --> 18:07.847
Is there a woman out there
you wouldn't sleep with?

18:07.972 --> 18:09.650
Eh, depends on the day.

18:09.775 --> 18:12.218
And while we're on the subject, actually,

18:12.343 --> 18:14.691
I have something kind of sensitive
I need to talk to you about.

18:14.816 --> 18:17.160
Our love scene today... it's
supposed to be pretty hot.

18:17.285 --> 18:20.630
I hope it doesn't bother you
if I get a little excited.

18:20.755 --> 18:24.834
It's involuntary, and let's face it,

18:24.959 --> 18:26.202
you kind of do it for me.

18:26.327 --> 18:28.370
Josh.

18:28.495 --> 18:30.172
Let me be very clear with you.

18:30.297 --> 18:34.239
If I feel anything brushing up
against me under those sheets,

18:34.364 --> 18:36.905
you will remember the
pain that I inflict on it

18:37.030 --> 18:38.406
for the rest of your life.

18:38.531 --> 18:40.299
Got it?

18:41.768 --> 18:44.178
She's kind of feisty.

18:44.303 --> 18:46.313
Yeah, tell me about it.

18:46.438 --> 18:48.115
Okay, you're officially worse than Antwon,

18:48.240 --> 18:49.616
and that is saying a lot.

18:49.741 --> 18:51.151
No, no, no, no. The left trigger aims.

18:51.276 --> 18:54.053
The right trigger shoots.
So you just want to...

18:54.178 --> 18:56.255
and you're dead... again.

18:56.380 --> 18:58.147
Don't worry, you'll re-spawn any second.

18:59.582 --> 19:02.460
Why don't I get a headset?

19:02.585 --> 19:04.294
Trust me, you're not ready for that.

19:04.419 --> 19:06.996
Oh, I think I am.

19:07.121 --> 19:08.697
Okay.

19:08.822 --> 19:10.298
Do not say you weren't warned.

19:10.423 --> 19:14.135
Okay, this is officially the most
uncool thing that I have ever done.

19:14.260 --> 19:15.536
I love it.

19:15.661 --> 19:17.904
Hey, what do I say? Should
I brag about my kill ratio?

19:18.029 --> 19:19.506
I would stay away from that one.

19:19.631 --> 19:21.274
Okay.

19:21.399 --> 19:25.810
Um, h... hello, other
players in the shooting game.

19:25.935 --> 19:27.312
Anybody there?

19:27.437 --> 19:29.480
Oh, hi! Yeah, yeah, I'm a girl.

19:29.605 --> 19:31.348
Um, jeans.

19:31.473 --> 19:33.950
What do you mean, what kind
of underwear am I wearing?

19:34.075 --> 19:37.520
Oh, my God.

19:37.645 --> 19:39.822
Oh, that's disgusting!

19:39.947 --> 19:41.056
You had enough?

19:41.181 --> 19:43.358
Who are these people? They are pure evil.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.826
- And you're one of them.
- No!

19:44.951 --> 19:45.994
Yes, you are.

19:46.119 --> 19:48.262
I'm sorry.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.455
I didn't mean to interrupt.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.167
Uh, I'll be right back.

19:54.292 --> 19:56.436
You know what? I... I have
some things I need to do.

19:56.561 --> 19:57.727
I'll just see you later. Okay.

20:03.033 --> 20:05.577
Hey. You okay?

20:05.702 --> 20:06.911
Yeah. I'm fine.

20:07.036 --> 20:09.281
I just didn't realize you
and Lauren were so close.

20:09.406 --> 20:10.982
- We're just friends.
- Okay.

20:11.107 --> 20:12.250
It's none of my business anyway.

20:12.375 --> 20:13.951
You can be friends with whoever you want.

20:14.076 --> 20:17.354
Besides, it's not like we're
together anymore, so who really cares?

20:17.479 --> 20:20.680
I guess just me.

20:30.956 --> 20:33.291
She told Jamie.

20:37.395 --> 20:39.105
How is he?

20:39.230 --> 20:41.807
He's okay. He's sleeping.

20:41.932 --> 20:45.911
Well, that's her decision, Haley.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.936
We're his parents. It
should be our decision.

20:49.739 --> 20:51.415
He's just a kid, you know?

20:51.540 --> 20:53.951
He shouldn't have to
deal with all this pain.

20:54.076 --> 20:55.820
Aren't we supposed to be protecting him

20:55.945 --> 20:57.122
from this kind of stuff?

20:57.247 --> 20:59.724
Maybe it's good for him to be prepared,

20:59.849 --> 21:02.860
to know that he doesn't have
a lot of time with his grandma.

21:02.985 --> 21:04.762
And what if she gets better?

21:04.887 --> 21:07.687
I'm not gonna get better, Haley.

21:13.086 --> 21:14.429
Hey, Nathan, would you mind, um...

21:14.554 --> 21:16.664
Yeah, sure.

21:26.765 --> 21:29.175
You're angry because I told Jamie.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.877
Not angry.

21:31.002 --> 21:33.145
I'm just upset...

21:33.270 --> 21:36.481
About everything.

21:36.606 --> 21:38.783
I needed him to know the truth, hales.

21:38.908 --> 21:41.585
Okay.

21:41.710 --> 21:43.711
I just wish we could've done it together.

21:45.447 --> 21:47.090
Mom, he's been through a lot.

21:47.215 --> 21:49.259
I get that.

21:49.384 --> 21:50.860
I'm sorry.

21:50.985 --> 21:53.286
Okay.

21:55.288 --> 21:57.165
I know that you think I've given up.

21:57.290 --> 21:59.900
You just seem so okay with all of this.

22:00.025 --> 22:01.868
No, I'm not okay.

22:01.993 --> 22:05.738
I'm... I'm at peace with it.

22:05.863 --> 22:11.642
You know, I fought hard.
I... God, I promise you, I...

22:11.767 --> 22:13.510
And then, one day, I just...

22:13.635 --> 22:15.879
I realized that I had to stop fighting

22:16.004 --> 22:21.649
and I had to start enjoying
the time that I had left.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.917
And that's all I'm trying to do.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.485
Can I ask you for
something, even though I know

22:26.610 --> 22:28.920
it's something that
you don't want to hear?

22:29.045 --> 22:32.526
Will you please let me
give your medical records

22:32.651 --> 22:34.863
to Nathan's doctor so that
somebody can take a look at it?

22:34.988 --> 22:37.332
It's just... it's not
gonna make any difference.

22:37.457 --> 22:40.668
It may not, but I'm not
ready to lose you yet, mom,

22:40.793 --> 22:43.470
so if there's anybody out
there who can do something,

22:43.595 --> 22:45.105
I have to take that chance.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.231
Will you please do that for me?

22:50.501 --> 22:51.944
Okay.

22:52.069 --> 22:54.513
You can give him my medical records...

22:54.638 --> 22:56.114
on one condition.

22:56.239 --> 23:01.552
When he comes back
with the same diagnosis,

23:01.677 --> 23:04.020
I need you to accept it, okay?

23:04.145 --> 23:06.089
Like I've accepted it.

23:06.214 --> 23:10.092
And, hopefully, then we can at least try

23:10.217 --> 23:12.294
to enjoy the time I have left...

23:12.419 --> 23:14.262
together, all of us.

23:14.387 --> 23:15.354
Please?

23:16.789 --> 23:19.333
Do that for me?

23:26.797 --> 23:28.540
Oh, hey, there you are.

23:28.665 --> 23:30.475
You kind of disappeared for a while.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.477
I was just trying to stay out of your way.

23:32.602 --> 23:34.846
I don't remember telling
you to stay out of my way.

23:34.971 --> 23:36.982
Well, you had to shoot

23:37.107 --> 23:39.051
that big sex scene with Alex and Josh,

23:39.176 --> 23:41.120
and I didn't really want
to be around for that.

23:41.245 --> 23:42.755
Ohh.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.423
It turned out pretty well, I think.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.625
Although, at one point,

23:45.750 --> 23:47.360
Josh did let out a girlish shriek,

23:47.485 --> 23:49.962
and then Alex stormed off to
her trailer for 10 minutes.

23:50.087 --> 23:51.397
Not really sure what that was.

23:51.522 --> 23:52.731
Actors.

23:52.856 --> 23:53.956
Yeah.

23:56.126 --> 23:58.003
So, thanks for the sweater.

23:58.128 --> 23:59.938
Yeah, it's no big deal.
I mean, it's yours.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.096
I figured you might want it.

24:03.033 --> 24:05.209
So, get this.

24:05.334 --> 24:09.745
I think that my mom and your dad

24:09.870 --> 24:13.348
have become lovers.

24:13.473 --> 24:15.350
We did kind of see this coming.

24:15.475 --> 24:16.617
Yeah.

24:16.742 --> 24:19.486
Apparently, your dad is quite gentle.

24:19.611 --> 24:20.720
What?

24:20.845 --> 24:24.619
Not to mention extremely passionate.

24:24.744 --> 24:26.087
Why are you doing this to me?

24:26.212 --> 24:27.922
Because I had to suffer through it alone.

24:28.047 --> 24:29.857
Now we can at least
be equally traumatized.

24:29.982 --> 24:31.091
Thank you.

24:31.216 --> 24:32.326
Yeah.

24:32.451 --> 24:36.229
Wouldn't it be weird if
they ended up together?

24:36.354 --> 24:37.997
Honestly, I'm kind of envious of them.

24:38.122 --> 24:39.956
At least they're going for it, right?

24:42.392 --> 24:44.192
Yeah.

24:46.662 --> 24:47.938
All right, I gotta run,

24:48.063 --> 24:50.239
but thanks again for the sweater, Brooke.

24:50.364 --> 24:51.931
Mm-hmm.

24:57.635 --> 24:59.578
Okay, you'll have
complete creative control,

24:59.703 --> 25:01.046
you'll keep publishing,

25:01.171 --> 25:03.614
and here's where we got
a little overly generous.

25:03.739 --> 25:06.985
51% of profits and 35% of merchandising.

25:07.110 --> 25:08.788
Uh, m... merchandising?

25:08.913 --> 25:10.893
You're gonna make t-shirts
with my face on them?

25:11.018 --> 25:13.596
We're gonna make a lot of
things with your face on them.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.431
We can talk about the beard later.

25:15.556 --> 25:18.801
All you have to do is sign right here.

25:18.926 --> 25:21.937
Well, you haven't heard
my list of demands yet.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.228
What else?

25:28.200 --> 25:30.910
What the hell is that?

25:31.035 --> 25:33.478
Pickled eggs, of course.

25:33.603 --> 25:35.547
Why would something like that exist?

25:35.672 --> 25:38.016
For times like this.

25:38.141 --> 25:41.218
My first demand... eat one.

25:41.343 --> 25:44.144
You can't be serious.

25:45.413 --> 25:46.813
You're serious.

26:02.294 --> 26:05.405
Hey, buddy.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.406
Look at all this cool stuff.

26:07.531 --> 26:09.875
Yeah, I'm just going
through some old things.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.110
Okay.

26:12.235 --> 26:13.678
Now we're talking.

26:13.803 --> 26:17.215
Did I ever tell you that
I'm a wiffle ball legend?

26:17.340 --> 26:19.150
Yeah, a bunch of times.

26:19.275 --> 26:20.685
Right.

26:20.810 --> 26:22.920
You know, when I was your age,

26:23.045 --> 26:24.288
your grandpa Dan...

26:24.413 --> 26:26.523
he built me a miniature
Fenway park in the backyard.

26:26.648 --> 26:30.593
Even had a green monster, a pesky pole.

26:30.718 --> 26:32.828
It was pretty awesome.

26:32.953 --> 26:35.564
And then Grandma Deb made you tear
it down because it was so ugly.

26:35.689 --> 26:38.257
Guess I need so new stories.

26:40.226 --> 26:42.002
You all right, buddy?

26:42.127 --> 26:44.137
Is there anything you want to talk about?

26:44.262 --> 26:47.030
I'm fine. I'm just a
little busy right now.

26:48.499 --> 26:50.066
Don't worry. I still like your stories.

26:53.637 --> 26:55.680
If you need me, I'm here.

26:55.805 --> 26:56.705
Okay?

27:07.382 --> 27:08.990
Mouth.

27:09.115 --> 27:10.381
Owen.

27:11.617 --> 27:13.260
What are you doing here?

27:13.385 --> 27:16.329
I'm here to pick up Millie.

27:16.454 --> 27:18.366
Right.

27:23.651 --> 27:26.095
Arrgh, me Matey.

27:26.220 --> 27:28.296
All right, that... that was terrible.

27:28.421 --> 27:30.931
And you are gonna have to
work on your pirate speak.

27:31.056 --> 27:32.499
But at least we're getting somewhere.

27:32.624 --> 27:34.734
You know, I did everything on
your made-up list of demands.

27:34.859 --> 27:36.570
- I ate that disgusting egg...
- It doesn't sound to me

27:36.695 --> 27:39.206
like you're working on your pirate speak.

27:39.331 --> 27:42.576
I ate the egg.

27:42.701 --> 27:44.478
I washed your mugs with me hands.

27:44.603 --> 27:46.246
Even though they were perfectly
clean and didn't need it.

27:46.371 --> 27:47.514
There were few water spots.

27:47.639 --> 27:49.348
And I called your voicemail

27:49.473 --> 27:51.416
pretending to be a very
satisfied sexual partner

27:51.541 --> 27:53.317
begging for one more night.

27:53.442 --> 27:56.420
I can't wait to play that in public.

27:56.545 --> 27:57.721
There. You happy?

27:57.846 --> 27:59.989
I did everything you
asked me to. So we're good?

28:00.114 --> 28:01.581
We're up to a single.

28:02.850 --> 28:05.494
Most people would kill
for a record contract.

28:05.619 --> 28:07.262
Here's the thing, Miranda.

28:07.387 --> 28:09.097
Writing and performing
music for me is like...

28:09.222 --> 28:10.598
it's like standing naked in a crowd.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.767
You're being a little dramatic.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.403
Okay, maybe I'm in my underwear.

28:15.528 --> 28:18.441
But the point is, I'm still vulnerable.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.644
And it wasn't just about a girl.

28:20.769 --> 28:22.779
It was about the guy that I became.

28:22.904 --> 28:25.515
I didn't like him, and
neither did anyone else.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.641
And I would rather not see him come back.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.189
Hello?

28:34.314 --> 28:36.024
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:36.149 --> 28:37.725
Oh, who's playing?

28:37.850 --> 28:40.694
Syracuse and Virginity Tech.

28:40.819 --> 28:43.261
Okay, that sounds like
an intriguing match-up.

28:43.386 --> 28:44.662
Who's winning?

28:44.787 --> 28:45.796
Owen.

28:45.921 --> 28:47.631
And Owen is...

28:47.756 --> 28:49.465
The guy who's out with Millie right now.

28:49.590 --> 28:50.799
Ahh. And I take it you're jealous?

28:50.924 --> 28:52.334
Of course I'm jealous.

28:52.459 --> 28:53.635
But mostly I'm just worried,

28:53.760 --> 28:54.969
because she doesn't need to be

28:55.094 --> 28:56.537
hanging out with an addict right now.

28:56.662 --> 28:58.572
Especially not the same
addict who took her virginity.

28:58.697 --> 28:59.940
Oh.

29:00.065 --> 29:01.776
Ohh, is that why you said
Syracuse was playing...

29:01.901 --> 29:03.768
- Yeah.
- Got it.

29:05.271 --> 29:07.348
Look, Mouth...

29:07.473 --> 29:09.616
You broke up with her, right?

29:09.741 --> 29:12.087
So she's gonna live her life.

29:12.212 --> 29:14.022
And she should.

29:14.147 --> 29:16.190
She can see whoever she wants.

29:16.315 --> 29:19.493
But if that bothers
you, then just tell her.

29:19.618 --> 29:22.385
Because maybe that means
it's not over for you yet.

29:24.354 --> 29:27.799
So, you really think it's
over between you and Mouth?

29:27.924 --> 29:29.700
Honestly, I try not to think about it,

29:29.825 --> 29:31.668
'cause there's nothing I can do right now.

29:31.793 --> 29:33.770
You sure about that?

29:33.895 --> 29:35.237
I don't know.

29:35.362 --> 29:38.005
I mean, the reason we
broke up is all my fault,

29:38.130 --> 29:40.041
so my hands are pretty much tied.

29:40.166 --> 29:42.377
All I can do is wait to be forgiven.

29:42.502 --> 29:45.446
I can tell you what I hope will happen,

29:45.571 --> 29:47.948
but I have no way of
knowing if he'll ever be able

29:48.073 --> 29:49.573
to look at me the way he used to.

29:51.676 --> 29:53.553
That's why I try not to think about it.

29:53.678 --> 29:55.288
You know, we should do something fun.

29:55.413 --> 29:57.089
Like what?

29:57.214 --> 29:59.124
I don't know. We'll figure something out.

29:59.249 --> 30:00.916
Come on.

30:05.119 --> 30:06.762
Aww.

30:06.887 --> 30:09.197
Oh, my gosh! Where did you find this?

30:09.322 --> 30:10.998
Was it in those boxes?

30:11.123 --> 30:12.867
Yeah, grandma gave it to me.

30:12.992 --> 30:15.102
Yeah. I haven't see this photo in forever.

30:15.227 --> 30:16.836
Look at my hair.

30:16.961 --> 30:19.062
I mean, I know it was
early morning, but geez.

30:22.332 --> 30:25.209
Hey, listen, buddy.

30:25.334 --> 30:28.245
I know how hard this must be for you.

30:28.370 --> 30:31.805
So, if you need to cry, it's okay.

30:34.240 --> 30:37.618
I'm not crying for me. I'm crying for you.

30:37.743 --> 30:39.711
Your mom's gonna die.

30:44.182 --> 30:47.661
The one thing I never want
to lose is you or daddy.

30:47.786 --> 30:50.396
We're not going anywhere.

30:50.521 --> 30:52.789
I promise.

30:59.094 --> 31:02.696
You're taking good care of my daughter.

31:04.131 --> 31:06.075
Ooh, I remember the day

31:06.200 --> 31:08.712
you came to ask our
permission to marry her.

31:08.837 --> 31:11.147
You were so nervous.

31:11.272 --> 31:14.217
Yeah.

31:14.342 --> 31:17.052
But I looked into your eyes,

31:17.177 --> 31:19.088
and I just knew.

31:19.213 --> 31:20.990
What did you know?

31:21.115 --> 31:24.117
That were gonna change my daughter's life.

31:25.686 --> 31:27.654
And I was right.

31:30.658 --> 31:32.735
You we responsible for raising the woman

31:32.860 --> 31:35.871
that changed my entire world.

31:35.996 --> 31:39.564
I'll never forget that, Lydia, ever.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.533
Thank you for saying yes.

31:53.973 --> 31:56.084
Oh, come on!

31:56.209 --> 31:57.585
That's just not possible.

31:57.710 --> 31:59.053
What's not possible?

31:59.178 --> 32:02.222
Are you referring to my
three consecutive strikes

32:02.347 --> 32:04.124
or just that particular strike?

32:04.249 --> 32:06.393
All of the above. Ah!

32:06.518 --> 32:08.327
Just glad we didn't put money on it.

32:08.452 --> 32:11.130
This was a bad idea.

32:11.255 --> 32:12.899
No, this was a really good idea.

32:13.024 --> 32:15.224
Thanks for cheering me
up, Owen. I needed it.

32:21.263 --> 32:22.997
God!

32:26.166 --> 32:28.767
I can't even remember
the last time I laughed.

32:33.205 --> 32:34.538
You know he's not gone yet.

32:36.474 --> 32:37.750
Mouth.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.552
You shouldn't give up on him.

32:39.677 --> 32:42.454
And you can't just sit around
waiting for him to forgive you.

32:42.579 --> 32:44.689
Look, I understand.

32:44.814 --> 32:46.224
As an addict,

32:46.349 --> 32:50.660
I've ruined a lot of important
relationships in my life.

32:50.785 --> 32:53.696
That's why, if he's important to you,

32:53.821 --> 32:55.864
you got to at least try to get him back.

32:58.491 --> 33:00.436
I don't know how to get him back.

33:03.364 --> 33:06.809
Just remind him of the
girl he fell in love with.

33:06.934 --> 33:08.844
Show him you're still that girl...

33:08.969 --> 33:12.046
Or that you're working
hard to try to find her.

33:12.171 --> 33:14.616
You do that,

33:14.741 --> 33:17.075
I guarantee he'll look
at you the way he used to.

33:20.177 --> 33:21.921
Do you mind if we get going?

33:22.046 --> 33:24.180
Not at all. You're killing me anyway.

33:25.349 --> 33:27.792
This is embarrassing.

33:30.219 --> 33:31.252
Thank you, Owen.

33:33.555 --> 33:34.797
How's it going?

33:34.922 --> 33:36.565
This place is crawling with agents.

33:36.690 --> 33:37.733
They're like vultures.

33:37.858 --> 33:40.736
Well, just remember, you're one of them.

33:40.861 --> 33:42.504
Are you circling anyone right now?

33:42.629 --> 33:44.305
I've had a few meetings.

33:44.430 --> 33:47.175
I really missed you. I
needed to hear your voice.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.409
Really?

33:48.534 --> 33:49.576
Yeah.

33:49.701 --> 33:52.111
I like that. And I miss you, too.

33:52.236 --> 33:53.812
Hey, babe, I gotta go.

33:53.937 --> 33:55.447
I have a few more players to meet with,

33:55.572 --> 33:56.682
but I'm coming home tomorrow.

33:56.807 --> 33:58.550
I'll be waiting. Bye.

33:58.675 --> 34:00.184
All right, bye.

34:00.309 --> 34:01.919
Hey, that was a great match.

34:02.044 --> 34:03.520
Hey, Grubbs.

34:03.645 --> 34:04.787
Miranda says you're torturing her.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.322
Knock it off, okay?

34:06.447 --> 34:08.347
- Really?
- No. I'm kind of loving it.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.592
Hi, friendly faces.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.793
Do you guys mind if I play
third wheel for a little while?

34:13.918 --> 34:15.262
I'm not ready to go home yet.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.996
Yeah, you just missed my Millie rant.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.331
I want to hear the Millie rant.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.600
Oh, we've moved on to the Julian rant.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.168
Ooh, great. Can you at least
start from the beginning?

34:23.293 --> 34:24.804
You didn't miss much.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.704
I was just saying

34:26.829 --> 34:32.310
that sometimes our relationship
seems so simple and easy.

34:32.435 --> 34:35.212
But no matter what, it
just turns into a big mess.

34:35.337 --> 34:39.215
And there are days that I
want to dive into that mess,

34:39.340 --> 34:42.685
but then, other days,
I can't help but wonder

34:42.810 --> 34:47.222
if maybe we're just two people
who don't work as a couple.

34:47.347 --> 34:49.224
But you love him, right?

34:49.349 --> 34:51.659
Like you don't even know.

34:51.784 --> 34:53.761
Then don't wait.

34:53.886 --> 34:56.063
Life's too short to play games.

34:56.188 --> 34:58.431
If you love somebody and
you want to be with them,

34:58.556 --> 34:59.833
then go get them.

34:59.958 --> 35:02.702
Deal with the mess later.

35:02.827 --> 35:05.270
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.

35:05.395 --> 35:08.839
Well... here I am.

35:08.964 --> 35:11.199
Standing in front of a
crowd in my underwear.

35:15.070 --> 35:16.670
Whoa.

35:18.873 --> 35:20.482
Feeling vulnerable?

35:20.607 --> 35:22.451
I'm hot, and you're talented.

35:22.576 --> 35:24.309
And if I can do it, so can you.

35:25.745 --> 35:27.855
Which is the reason I'm standing here...

35:27.980 --> 35:30.023
because I believe in you.

35:30.148 --> 35:33.383
Maybe it's time for you
to believe in yourself.

35:35.752 --> 35:38.053
Bugger off.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.767
Mmm.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.802
Wow.

35:45.927 --> 35:49.505
Sorry. Bad habit.

35:49.630 --> 35:51.406
You're forgiven. It was a long day.

35:51.531 --> 35:53.107
But at least we got through it, right?

35:53.232 --> 35:55.109
Barely. I'm so tired.

35:55.234 --> 35:56.777
Hopefully tomorrow I'll be better-rested.

35:56.902 --> 35:58.746
I can't believe a bunch
of patio-furniture salesmen

35:58.871 --> 36:00.180
kept you up all night.

36:00.305 --> 36:04.117
Actually, it wasn't just
the patio-furniture guys.

36:04.242 --> 36:06.552
I kind of slept with Alexander last night.

36:06.677 --> 36:09.254
Oh.

36:09.379 --> 36:11.689
"Oh"? Why'd you say it like that?

36:11.814 --> 36:13.191
How did I say it?

36:13.316 --> 36:15.359
I don't know, kind of sad-sacky,

36:15.484 --> 36:16.894
like maybe you're a little jealous.

36:17.019 --> 36:18.061
Alex...

36:18.186 --> 36:19.996
I'm kidding. Relax.

36:20.121 --> 36:22.031
Let's change the subject.

36:22.156 --> 36:23.556
How are things with Brooke?

36:25.292 --> 36:26.902
Obviously, we still love each other.

36:27.027 --> 36:29.971
But every time we get too
close, one of us puts up a wall.

36:30.096 --> 36:32.707
And it's not easy being on
the other side of that wall.

36:32.832 --> 36:34.575
So tear down the wall.

36:34.700 --> 36:36.009
You don't understand.

36:36.134 --> 36:37.744
When Brooke Davis puts up a wall,

36:37.869 --> 36:39.946
that thing's not coming
down until she's ready.

36:40.071 --> 36:42.614
And you have to wait. That's fair.

36:42.739 --> 36:44.373
I got to get some sleep.

36:46.309 --> 36:50.521
Julian, if I thought you and
Brooke were really just friends,

36:50.646 --> 36:52.747
Alexander wouldn't have been
the one in my bed last night.

36:55.216 --> 36:57.718
Good night.

37:00.821 --> 37:03.866
Alex...

37:03.991 --> 37:06.125
I'll walk you to your room.

37:22.009 --> 37:23.236
Hmm.

37:29.297 --> 37:30.974
Can I help you?

37:31.099 --> 37:32.309
I lost my key.

37:32.434 --> 37:35.636
I'm staying with my
boyfriend, Julian Baker.

37:39.074 --> 37:43.053
Oh, well, um, it says
here you guys broke up.

37:43.178 --> 37:46.390
Oh, please, that story is so last week.

37:46.515 --> 37:48.492
Oh, thank God.

37:48.617 --> 37:50.594
You know what? Can I tell you a secret?

37:50.719 --> 37:52.062
I wish you wouldn't.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.130
I've always rooted for you two.

37:53.255 --> 37:54.598
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:54.723 --> 37:56.591
Can I get that key?

38:04.264 --> 38:06.198
Hey. What's up?

38:08.834 --> 38:12.012
Just heard from the doctor.

38:12.137 --> 38:16.046
There's nothing they can do for her.

38:18.139 --> 38:20.115
Okay.

38:21.973 --> 38:24.016
- I just thought...
- I know.

38:24.141 --> 38:26.250
I know. I'm so sorry, baby.

38:28.175 --> 38:30.484
I wish I could change this for you.

38:49.691 --> 38:51.701
Hey, I know it's late.

38:51.826 --> 38:54.470
I was just thinking...

38:54.595 --> 38:56.771
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.

38:56.896 --> 38:58.539
Sometimes you just have to go for it,

38:58.664 --> 39:00.841
and that's what I'm doing.

39:00.966 --> 39:03.176
I want to go out with you...

39:03.301 --> 39:04.744
on a date.

39:04.869 --> 39:08.280
Um...

39:08.405 --> 39:10.538
promise me one thing.

39:12.742 --> 39:14.552
If I start to change

39:14.677 --> 39:18.154
or if I start to become
that guy that nobody likes...

39:18.279 --> 39:20.355
you won't.

39:20.480 --> 39:24.393
I'm gonna make sure u
stay exactly who you are...

39:24.518 --> 39:28.129
'Cause that's a person worth protecting.

39:44.990 --> 39:47.491
Excuse me. Are you Katie Ryan?

40:37.164 --> 40:39.031
Now we can spend Christmas together.

41:04.651 --> 41:06.862
It's okay, sweetheart.

41:19.430 --> 41:21.073
Show me what we got here.

41:21.198 --> 41:22.573
Oh, thanks, buddy.

41:25.366 --> 41:27.276
You got a sword. Oh, thank you.
