00:06.628 --> 00:08.546
The Chumash Indians told tales

00:08.548 --> 00:11.698
of large, hairy creatures
who roam these woods.

00:11.700 --> 00:14.034
We're in
the Angeles National Forest,

00:14.036 --> 00:16.670
and tonight,
we'll try to find one.

00:16.672 --> 00:18.055
I'm Brad Ross,

00:18.057 --> 00:20.007
and you're watching
<i>Bigfoot Hunters.</i>

00:20.009 --> 00:21.141
Cut.

00:21.143 --> 00:22.426
What was wrong with that one?

00:22.428 --> 00:24.178
Give me more.

00:24.180 --> 00:25.579
Less is more.

00:25.581 --> 00:27.932
In cheesy paranormal shows,
less is less.

00:27.934 --> 00:30.050
You are not David Attenborough.

00:30.052 --> 00:31.551
I have a degree in biology.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.520
And I used to work on <i>Survivor.</i>

00:33.522 --> 00:35.105
So I guess
we're both slumming it.

00:35.107 --> 00:36.941
All right, just do
the damn intro again.

00:36.943 --> 00:38.058
Let's get on with it.

00:38.060 --> 00:39.559
I'm freezing my butt off.

00:44.032 --> 00:47.418
The Chumash Indians told tales

00:47.420 --> 00:50.788
of large, hairy creatures
that roamed...

00:53.409 --> 00:54.842
What was that?

00:54.844 --> 00:56.410
Shh.

00:56.412 --> 00:58.846
Let's find out. Come on.

00:58.848 --> 01:00.214
Uh, uh, wait.

01:07.974 --> 01:09.756
Hey, over there.

01:20.619 --> 01:22.486

Al-Qaeda has a base

01:52.601 --> 01:53.800
My daughter's school
is doing

01:53.802 --> 01:55.102
a living history book.

01:55.104 --> 01:57.571
All the parents are dressing up
as historical figures

01:57.573 --> 01:59.139
and talking
about their accomplishments.

01:59.141 --> 02:00.691
And you're going
as Neil Armstrong.

02:00.693 --> 02:02.443
Nah, Guy Bluford.

02:03.311 --> 02:04.811
First black astronaut in space.

02:04.813 --> 02:06.413
Sorry.

02:06.415 --> 02:09.483
The only black astronaut I know
is Lando Calrissian.

02:10.703 --> 02:12.536
This job keeps me too busy
to do all the things

02:12.538 --> 02:14.922
I'd like with my daughter,
so I'm gonna go all out

02:14.924 --> 02:16.340
and make her feel special.

02:16.342 --> 02:17.458
Nice.

02:17.460 --> 02:18.592
I want her to think

02:18.594 --> 02:19.760
I'm the coolest dad there.

02:19.762 --> 02:22.012
I called in a favor
and got a real space suit.

02:22.014 --> 02:24.348
That's a real space suit?

02:24.350 --> 02:26.166
Mike Collins wore it.

02:26.168 --> 02:28.385
Mike... Who's Mike Collins?

02:28.387 --> 02:30.003
First lunar mission.

02:30.005 --> 02:32.022
He's the guy who stayed
up in the command module

02:32.024 --> 02:34.058
while Armstrong
and Aldrin walked on the moon.

02:34.060 --> 02:36.026
You really know your astronauts.

02:36.028 --> 02:37.194
You got to respect a man

02:37.196 --> 02:38.862
who takes one for the team
like that.

02:38.864 --> 02:41.681
Went 250,000 miles just to wait
in the car.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.518
Can I try it on?
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want

02:44.520 --> 02:47.321
your greasy mop contaminating
my nice, clean space helmet.

02:47.323 --> 02:50.240
You're obviously jealous
of my beautiful, flowing locks.

02:50.242 --> 02:51.408
Hey, will you sign this?

02:51.410 --> 02:53.160
Yeah, of course. Who's it for?

02:53.162 --> 02:55.079
Morgan, he's retiring.

02:56.548 --> 02:58.665
Morgan?

03:01.586 --> 03:03.837
Which-which one's Morgan?

03:03.839 --> 03:05.672
Um, I don't actually know.

03:05.674 --> 03:07.007
Just sign it and pass it around.

03:07.009 --> 03:10.377
Morgan, you will be missed.

03:10.379 --> 03:12.229
Seems a little disingenuous.

03:12.231 --> 03:14.314
I cannot wait to retire.

03:14.316 --> 03:16.567
You know, you actually got
to do some work

03:16.569 --> 03:18.352
before you can retire
from something, Deeks.

03:18.354 --> 03:20.604
Just gonna sit on that beach
with my dog,

03:20.606 --> 03:23.390
Monty Junior, Junior.

03:23.392 --> 03:25.826
You know, just checking out
the lady birds in their bikinis.

03:25.828 --> 03:28.862
See, you're only young once,
but you can be immature forever.

03:28.864 --> 03:30.164
Preach it, sister.
What about you?

03:30.166 --> 03:32.566
After my second term
as president...

03:32.568 --> 03:34.368
Your second term?

03:34.370 --> 03:35.602
No way she's a one-termer.

03:35.604 --> 03:37.921
No way. Two terms.

03:37.923 --> 03:39.757
After my second term
as president,

03:39.759 --> 03:42.259
I am going to retire
and run my non-profit.

03:42.261 --> 03:43.910
Oh, yeah? What's your cause?

03:43.912 --> 03:46.296
Getting creeps
off our nation's beaches.

03:46.298 --> 03:48.766
See, somebody's got to protect
those girls in bikinis

03:48.768 --> 03:50.517
from leering octogenarians
such as Deeks.

03:50.519 --> 03:51.751
I'll see you there.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.720
Sam, what about you?

03:53.722 --> 03:55.272
I'm just gonna take it easy,

03:55.274 --> 03:57.775
watch my grandkids
play football.

03:57.777 --> 03:59.926
What if your grandkids
are girls?

03:59.928 --> 04:02.279
Under the Blye administration,
girls are gonna play football.

04:02.281 --> 04:03.530
They could...

04:03.532 --> 04:05.115
Don't make a wide receiver joke.

04:05.117 --> 04:06.567
Furthest thing from my mind.

04:06.569 --> 04:07.618
What about you, G?

04:07.620 --> 04:09.703
I would never make
a wide receiver joke.

04:09.705 --> 04:11.238
Thank you.
Tight end, maybe.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.456
No, retirement plans.

04:12.458 --> 04:13.657
What about your private island?

04:13.659 --> 04:16.326
Uh, yeah, I don't think my 401k

04:16.327 --> 04:18.128
is gonna pay
for a private island.

04:19.498 --> 04:22.216
It's from Morgan's
retirement party,

04:22.218 --> 04:24.501
and we've got a case.

04:24.503 --> 04:26.136
Is that a real space suit?

04:26.138 --> 04:27.254
Yep.

04:27.256 --> 04:29.473
Awesome.

04:29.475 --> 04:31.291
See, children think it's cool.

04:31.293 --> 04:33.677
Told you.

04:33.679 --> 04:36.180
This is footage
from a television show

04:36.182 --> 04:37.964
called <i>Bigfoot Hunters.</i>

04:37.966 --> 04:41.151
They were filming in the Angeles
National Forest last night.

04:41.153 --> 04:43.153
Bigfoot, seriously?

04:43.155 --> 04:44.804
He prefers Sasquatch

04:44.806 --> 04:47.324
'cause, uh,
Bigfoot's offensive,

04:47.326 --> 04:49.860
Don't mock, Mr. Deeks.

04:51.312 --> 04:54.081
During my second summit
up Everest,

04:54.083 --> 04:57.817
I was hopelessly lost
in a blizzard

04:57.819 --> 05:00.170
when I came face-to-face

05:00.172 --> 05:03.757
with something
that only could have been

05:03.759 --> 05:05.292
the legendary yeti.

05:05.294 --> 05:06.460
What happened next?

05:06.462 --> 05:09.463
What happened
next, Miss Blye,

05:09.465 --> 05:10.997
is a story for another day.

05:10.999 --> 05:12.799
Today we're focused

05:12.801 --> 05:14.351
on the case at hand.

05:22.310 --> 05:24.194
That is not Bigfoot.

05:24.196 --> 05:26.280
Dean Albertson,
he'd been wanted for acts

05:26.282 --> 05:28.699
of domestic terrorism
since the early '70s.

05:28.701 --> 05:30.868
Albertson was a founding member
or the terrorist group

05:30.870 --> 05:32.819
called "The GBP."

05:32.821 --> 05:34.288
GBP?

05:34.290 --> 05:35.855
Gun Barrel Party.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.792
Named after something
Mao Tse-tung said.

05:38.794 --> 05:42.296
"Political power grows
out of the barrel of a gun."

05:42.298 --> 05:44.248
Right on, Mr. Callen.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.583
The GBP was wanted for a string
of bombings

05:46.585 --> 05:48.468
which took place
up and down the west coast

05:48.470 --> 05:51.871
at police stations, courthouses,
and military bases.

05:51.873 --> 05:55.041
Several of the members did time
on the FBI's Most Wanted list,

05:55.043 --> 05:56.226
including Albertson.

05:56.228 --> 05:58.228
His fingerprints
were found at the scene

05:58.230 --> 06:01.348
of a 1973 explosion
at Naval Base San Diego.

06:01.350 --> 06:03.066
Killed three sailors.

06:03.068 --> 06:05.435
Albertson hadn't been heard
from since.

06:05.437 --> 06:07.387
Any reason to think his death
is connected

06:07.389 --> 06:08.855
to his former activities?

06:08.857 --> 06:10.741
Well, we found this.

06:10.743 --> 06:14.328
It's a manifesto claiming
that the Gun Barrel Party

06:14.330 --> 06:15.579
plans to, quote,

06:15.581 --> 06:18.365
"reemerge from the shadows
to attack institutions

06:18.367 --> 06:21.451
"of American injustice
and fire the first shots

06:21.453 --> 06:25.372
in a revolution that will bring
about our own Arab Spring."

06:25.374 --> 06:28.074
So, if the GBP is coming back,
it's a...

06:28.076 --> 06:29.909
Matter of national security.

06:29.911 --> 06:33.297
It certainly
is, Mr. Hanna.

06:33.299 --> 06:35.632
It certainly is.

06:45.070 --> 06:46.121
The manifesto was posted

06:46.123 --> 06:47.622
from a coffee shop
in the Valley,

06:47.624 --> 06:49.240
so it could've been anyone
on their Wi-Fi.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.675
If the Gun Barrel Party
is thinking

06:50.677 --> 06:52.127
about making a comeback,

06:52.129 --> 06:54.345
it's not gonna be easy to put
the band back together.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.247
So there were eight
members of their group.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.633
Albertson died last night.

06:58.635 --> 07:01.803
Flatt went down in a shootout
with police 20 years ago.

07:01.805 --> 07:05.690
Franklin, he died of cancer
in the '90s.

07:05.692 --> 07:08.393
And these four all died
when bombs they were making

07:08.395 --> 07:10.278
exploded at a cabin in Oregon.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.430
Okay, so this guy's
the only one left.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.932
So he's our number one suspect.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.318
Not quite. Jim Mullins
is serving life at Oakville

07:17.320 --> 07:19.954
for killing two people
during a bank robbery in 1979.

07:19.956 --> 07:21.456
Well, we got to
start somewhere.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.742
All right, Sam and I will go
visit Mullins, see what he knows.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.326
Kensi, Deeks, why don't you
check out the crime scene?

07:25.328 --> 07:26.411
See if LAPD missed anything.

07:26.413 --> 07:29.214
All right,
I'll get my hiking boots.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.499
Um, see, no.

07:31.501 --> 07:33.334
See, this is...
this is not cool.

07:33.336 --> 07:34.469
What's the problem, Deeks?

07:34.471 --> 07:35.970
Crime scene's out in
the middle of the woods.

07:35.972 --> 07:37.672
You know how I feel
about the woods.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.224
You want to go to a prison?

07:39.226 --> 07:40.458
Uh, actually, yeah.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.811
Okay, I'll play you rock,
paper, scissors for it.

07:42.813 --> 07:44.345
Seriously?
Why not?

07:44.347 --> 07:46.564
All right, ready?

07:49.351 --> 07:50.852
Boom! Kensi,
put on your prison shoes,

07:50.854 --> 07:52.136
'cause we're going to prison.

07:53.906 --> 07:55.657
Why are you celebrating?
Paper beats rock.

07:55.659 --> 07:56.908
Paper beats rock?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.076
Rock tears paper.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.944
Since when?

07:59.946 --> 08:01.746
Since always.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.164
That's not how we played it.

08:03.166 --> 08:04.499
Well, you were raised out here.

08:04.501 --> 08:05.784
I play East Coast rules.

08:05.786 --> 08:06.984
East Coast rules?

08:06.986 --> 08:08.119
Yeah, step your game up.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.672
Don't be a sore loser, Deeks.

08:10.674 --> 08:12.423
All right, have fun at prison.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.159
East Coast rules, really?

08:15.161 --> 08:16.845
Don't worry,
it's all part of my plan.

08:16.847 --> 08:18.663
What plan?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.215
Pretend inferiority

08:20.217 --> 08:22.684
and encourage his arrogance.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.472
This was you
pretending inferiority?

08:27.474 --> 08:29.107
That's classic Sun Tzu.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.476
Since when do you read Sun Tzu?

08:31.478 --> 08:34.679
Since Hetty gave me
<i>The Art of War</i> for Christmas.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.482
Hetty also gave me an ancient
textbook for Christmas.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.033
She did? What'd she give you?

08:39.034 --> 08:41.785
I'm not gonna tell you.

08:41.788 --> 08:45.356
She gave you <i>Kama Sutra,</i>
didn't she?

08:47.660 --> 08:50.027
Come on, was it <i>Kama Sutra?</i>

08:50.029 --> 08:51.195
Are you serious?

08:51.197 --> 08:53.548
Please tell me
it's <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

08:53.550 --> 08:57.302
Maybe we should start
a book club, just you and I.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.308
Okay, so Albertson fell here.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.144
What was he doing? Hiking?

09:06.146 --> 09:08.680
Nothing good happens
this deep in the woods.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.649
Out here, it's nothing but
banjo-playing rednecks

09:11.651 --> 09:14.218
and mass murderers
in hockey masks.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.520
Well, according
to the coroner's report

09:15.522 --> 09:18.740
that Eric sent, the cause
of death was a heart attack.

09:18.742 --> 09:20.275
So the knife didn't kill him?

09:20.277 --> 09:22.827
Maybe he heard banjo music
and died of fright.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.863
No, the knife did do it,
it just took a while.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.948
It turns out the blade missed
all the important stuff

09:26.950 --> 09:28.082
and nicked the pericardium.

09:28.084 --> 09:30.368
Pericardium-- look at you.
Triple word score.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.287
The blood filled the sack
around the heart.

09:32.289 --> 09:33.504
Eventually pressure

09:33.506 --> 09:35.757
caused cardiac arrest.
Ouch.

09:35.759 --> 09:37.842
Yeah, that would explain why
there's no blood on the ground

09:37.844 --> 09:39.177
and no splatter leading in.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.912
So this guy could have been
walking for miles,

09:40.914 --> 09:42.714
just looking for help.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.684
What do you got there,
Pocahontas?

09:46.686 --> 09:48.636
Albertson came from there.

09:48.638 --> 09:50.855
Came from... what? Where?
Where are you going?

09:50.857 --> 09:52.724
I am backtracking.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.642
Finding out where he came from.

09:54.644 --> 09:56.227
How can you even see his trail?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.095
I am at one with nature.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.898
Yeah, no, I'm one with nature.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.098
Oh!

10:01.100 --> 10:02.584
Oh, my God.

10:04.487 --> 10:06.371
Oh, come on!

10:06.373 --> 10:07.906
People who are at one
with nature

10:07.908 --> 10:10.041
do not step in number two.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.043
That is so gross,
and this is so huge.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.127
Maybe there is Bigfoot out here,

10:13.129 --> 10:14.746
'cause I think I just stepped in
his poo.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.381
No, it is not a Bigfoot.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.967
That belongs to a black bear.

10:18.969 --> 10:20.284
Wow, you really know your poo.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.086
Wait, are there really bears
out here?

10:22.088 --> 10:23.588
And mountain lions.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.957
See, this is why
I don't leave the city.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.809
Kens?

10:27.811 --> 10:28.826
Kensi!

10:28.828 --> 10:30.645
All right.

10:30.647 --> 10:32.964
Open 3.

10:36.468 --> 10:38.319
Sit down.

10:38.321 --> 10:41.639
Well, it's been a while

10:41.641 --> 10:43.858
since I had a couple pigs
visit me.

10:43.860 --> 10:47.829
Clearly, since no one's used
the word "pig" since 1978.

10:49.114 --> 10:52.116
Old friend of yours,
Dean Albertson, turned up

10:52.118 --> 10:55.670
last night with a knife
sticking out of his chest.

10:55.672 --> 10:57.956
Well, I'm pretty sure I got
a good alibi.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.123
Me, too.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.758
But an online manifesto claims

11:00.760 --> 11:02.160
your former terrorist
organization's

11:02.161 --> 11:03.344
making a comeback.

11:03.346 --> 11:04.829
Maybe as a charter member,

11:04.831 --> 11:06.798
they'll give me a break
on the dues.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.516
You have anything to do with it?

11:08.518 --> 11:10.668
What little computer time
I do get here

11:10.670 --> 11:12.520
is pretty closely monitored.

11:12.522 --> 11:14.522
You check with Big Brother.

11:14.524 --> 11:15.690
You have any idea where

11:15.692 --> 11:17.008
Dean Albertson's been
all these years?

11:17.010 --> 11:21.446
Who might want
to kill him?

11:21.448 --> 11:24.348
You don't seem too
broken up about it.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.653
How many lives have you taken?

11:29.705 --> 11:31.489
What?

11:31.491 --> 11:33.190
You're a soldier.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.192
I can smell it on you.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.880
How many lives have you taken?

11:38.882 --> 11:42.750
I prefer to think
about the lives I've saved.

11:42.752 --> 11:44.502
Me, too.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.038
You murdered
two security guards.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.723
Casualties of war.

11:48.725 --> 11:51.476
War? It was a bank robbery.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.727
No, an expropriation.

11:52.729 --> 11:55.013
I was stealing money
from the enemy government.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.347
Keep telling yourself that.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.716
Look, somebody stabs
and old buddy of yours,

11:58.718 --> 12:01.152
and they may be using
the Gun Barrel Party's name

12:01.154 --> 12:02.570
for their own purposes.

12:02.572 --> 12:05.239
I'd think you'd want to be
a part of this investigation.

12:05.241 --> 12:07.492
Albertson stopped
being a buddy of mine

12:07.494 --> 12:09.494
the day he deserted the cause.

12:09.496 --> 12:12.864
As far as the GBP's
resurrection goes,

12:12.866 --> 12:16.918
I got a feeling
it's in pretty good hands.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.838
So... if you have
more questions,

12:20.840 --> 12:22.540
ask my lawyer.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.909
We're through here.

12:27.746 --> 12:28.930
Open it up.

12:36.021 --> 12:37.355
He knows something.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.489
Guy's got life without parole.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.941
We don't have any leverage
on him.

12:39.943 --> 12:42.110
Somebody reached out to him.

12:42.112 --> 12:45.029
Such a pleasant guy, I can't
imagine why they wouldn't have.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.948
Eric.
G.

12:46.950 --> 12:48.699
Get me a list of Mullins'
recent visitors.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.935
Yeah, I'm on it.
Thanks.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.870
Albertson was
seriously out here.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.288
There isn't anything
for miles.

12:54.290 --> 12:56.774
Yeah, this place could
really use a sushi bar

12:56.776 --> 12:59.043
or a mini mall,
like a movie theater.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.128
Or a cabin.

13:00.130 --> 13:02.130
I was thinking more
of a sushi bar,

13:02.132 --> 13:03.631
you know what I mean?

13:03.633 --> 13:06.250
A little slice of salmon, but
whatever tickles your pickle.

13:06.252 --> 13:07.502
No, dummy. Cabin.

13:07.504 --> 13:08.920
Right. Now I see it.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.555
Wait. "Tickles
your pickle"?

13:10.557 --> 13:13.474
I wast trying it out.
What do you think?

13:13.476 --> 13:14.675
I think it's
inappropriate.

13:14.677 --> 13:17.962
I think it's strong
to moderately strong.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.915
So, what does Sun Tzu say

13:20.917 --> 13:22.299
about breaking
in doors?

13:22.301 --> 13:24.552
He says,
"Left side, safe.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.354
"Right side, safe.

13:26.356 --> 13:27.522
Middle, squished
like a grape."

13:27.524 --> 13:29.440
I'm pretty sure
that's not Sun Tzu.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.658
That's <i>Karate Kid.</i>

13:30.660 --> 13:31.926
It's still damn good advice.

13:31.928 --> 13:34.495
Ready?
One, two, three.

13:34.497 --> 13:36.981
Federal agents!

13:38.283 --> 13:39.817
This is nicer
than your apartment.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.120
Cleaner, too.
What?!

13:42.122 --> 13:44.122
"What?"

13:45.124 --> 13:46.323
You have a point.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.126
I happen
to like my stuff.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.627
That's what the hoarders say.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.328
I'll tell you one thing,

13:51.330 --> 13:53.431
Albertson was definitely
living here.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.302
And I don't think he was alone.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.504
Could have been
a cross-dresser.

14:01.523 --> 14:03.340
What? Never judge a man

14:03.342 --> 14:05.643
till you walk a mile
in his pumps.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.846
Oh, I don't think so.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.350
Hey! Federal agent!

14:13.352 --> 14:15.286
Federal agent! Stop!

14:18.524 --> 14:20.875
Get down!

14:20.877 --> 14:23.194
Uh, good, good, you got her.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.829
Hold still!
I'm coming. I just... ah...

14:24.831 --> 14:26.664
Give me your hands.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.199
How you feeling, buddy?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.634
That is a stupid question.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.502
Looks like she tickled
your pickle.

14:33.006 --> 14:37.091
That's, uh, that's clever.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.759
Yeah?

14:38.761 --> 14:39.777
How you doing?

14:39.779 --> 14:41.095
What are you looking at?
No!

14:41.097 --> 14:43.881
Young girl.

14:48.203 --> 14:50.571
He was
pronounced dead at the scene.

14:50.573 --> 14:52.406
I'm sorry.
I just need a minute.

14:52.408 --> 14:55.026
Of course.
Take your time.

14:55.028 --> 14:59.780
Leah Dewhurst, 52 years old,
no permanent address.

14:59.782 --> 15:02.950
She was arrested on shoplifting
and drug charges a few times,

15:02.952 --> 15:05.703
but... nothing violent.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.572
Anything in there about her
being a former Rockette

15:08.574 --> 15:10.574
or a placekicker
for the Giants?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.909
That's right.
Laugh it up.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.010
Mock my trauma.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.681
You heard it. She was
Albertson's girlfriend, and she

15:16.683 --> 15:19.267
had no idea that he had died
until I told her.

15:19.269 --> 15:20.268
You believe her?

15:20.270 --> 15:23.921
Yeah, I do.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.281
Here you go.

15:38.904 --> 15:41.205
I shouldn't have
left him.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.823
Where did you go?

15:42.825 --> 15:46.494
Into town for supplies.

15:46.496 --> 15:49.113
He wasn't feeling good,
so I went alone.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.781
It's a long trip.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.449
And I spent the night
at the shelter.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.884
Which one?

15:53.886 --> 15:57.621
The Santa Clarita
Women's Center.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.873
Nell, did you get that?

15:58.875 --> 16:00.558
Checking.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.127
Who would have wanted
Albertson dead?

16:05.630 --> 16:07.481
Leah, we know his past.

16:07.483 --> 16:11.185
Then you tell me.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.271
He wouldn't talk about it.

16:13.273 --> 16:19.026
The Dean Albertson I knew
was a sweet man.

16:19.028 --> 16:22.163
Whatever he did
back then was all behind him.

16:22.165 --> 16:23.581
Yep, her story checks out.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.649
She was at the shelter
during the time

16:25.651 --> 16:27.184
the coroner says
Albertson was killed.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.320
So, we're back to square one.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.788
Maybe not.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.823
I talked to Oakville Prison.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.892
Mullins had
two visitors recently.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.295
One was his sister,
who lives in Ohio.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.547
The other was a Glen Forest
University

16:39.549 --> 16:42.633
history professor, Dr. Roy Hale.

16:44.002 --> 16:46.137
Sam and I will pay him a visit.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.722
Deeks, why don't you help Kensi

16:47.724 --> 16:49.774
get Albertson's girlfriend
squared away?

16:49.776 --> 16:51.525
You might want to wear a cup.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.347
So, you met Jim Mullins.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.367
He's a charming guy.

16:59.369 --> 17:00.785
Why'd you go see him?

17:00.787 --> 17:02.953
I'm writing a book
on the Gun Barrel Party.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.789
One of my areas
of research interest

17:04.790 --> 17:06.156
is civil disobedience.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.540
The Gun Barrel Party's
disobedience

17:07.542 --> 17:09.226
was hardly civil.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.162
They liked to stir the pot.

17:11.164 --> 17:15.333
Stir the pot? You're talking
bombings and mass murders.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.667
They believed they had
the moral high ground

17:17.670 --> 17:20.221
which justified their
actions, however extreme.

17:20.223 --> 17:22.089
It's the same thing
al-Qaeda's selling.

17:22.090 --> 17:24.508
I'm merely explaining
their point of view.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.676
Did you talk
to Dean Albertson?

17:26.679 --> 17:27.845
My understanding is

17:27.847 --> 17:30.214
that no one's seen him
since the '70s.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.232
Until last night.

17:31.234 --> 17:34.352
He was found stabbed to death.

17:34.354 --> 17:38.222
Really?

17:38.224 --> 17:40.241
Do you know what happened?

17:40.243 --> 17:41.725
We're working on it.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.778
Well, I'm sure whatever you find

17:43.780 --> 17:46.580
will make for a very interesting
chapter in my book.

17:46.582 --> 17:48.666
Time for class, Dr. Hale.

17:48.668 --> 17:49.950
Oh, thank you, David.

17:49.952 --> 17:54.205
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me,
I have a lecture hall

17:54.207 --> 17:55.339
filled with fresh young minds

17:55.341 --> 17:59.794
waiting to ignore me
and text incessantly.

17:59.796 --> 18:01.262
Nice to meet you.

18:01.264 --> 18:03.130
Nice to meet you.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.551
Why do I feel
like everyone we've talked

18:07.553 --> 18:09.437
to today knows more
than they're saying?

18:09.439 --> 18:11.088
What else is new?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.607
G, take a look at this.

18:15.610 --> 18:18.229
Occupy rally on campus.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.697
Recognize the tag?

18:23.118 --> 18:24.935
I'll send that Eric.

18:25.987 --> 18:28.322
Graffiti belongs
to an anarchist group

18:28.324 --> 18:30.124
called Red Tide.

18:30.126 --> 18:32.609
LAPD has had trouble
with these guys before.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.044
They show up
and rampage through

18:34.046 --> 18:35.779
otherwise peaceful
demonstrations.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.047
Assault, vandalism.

18:37.049 --> 18:40.301
Not unlike the early tactics
of the Gun Barrel Party.

18:40.303 --> 18:42.586
Look at this.

18:45.290 --> 18:49.176
"The revolution is not
a warm fire in the hearth.

18:49.178 --> 18:51.178
"It's an inferno that
consumes the world.

18:51.180 --> 18:53.314
"Today at Glen Forest
University,

18:53.316 --> 18:56.484
the Gun Barrel Party
strikes the match."

18:56.486 --> 18:57.768
Where'd it come from?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.303
Uploaded to an anarchy board

18:59.305 --> 19:01.572
via a Wi-Fi server
at the university.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.574
Ms. Blye, Mr. Deeks,
it looks like

19:03.576 --> 19:06.193
you're going back to school.

19:15.313 --> 19:16.746
Try this on, Ms. Blye.

19:16.747 --> 19:19.414
See if it makes you feel
like a student again.

19:19.416 --> 19:21.883
Great.
That's fantastic. What about me?

19:21.885 --> 19:23.802
You get to make
yourself useful.

19:23.804 --> 19:26.954
Really? We're at this stage
in our relationship now?

19:26.956 --> 19:29.841
What stage might
that be, Deeks?

19:29.843 --> 19:32.177
The stage where I just stand
around holding your purse.

19:32.179 --> 19:33.928
Does that threaten
your manhood?

19:33.930 --> 19:37.065
No. Not unless the purse matches
my shoes.

19:37.067 --> 19:39.634
What?
Nothing.

19:39.636 --> 19:43.271
Totally secure out here
with my man purse. My murse.

19:43.273 --> 19:46.024
Hetty, what do you, uh,
what do you got for me?

19:46.026 --> 19:48.610
Am I gonna be a brainiac
or a jock

19:48.612 --> 19:49.778
or lazy college senior?

19:49.780 --> 19:51.696
How about custodial engineer?

19:51.698 --> 19:53.031
Ha!

19:53.033 --> 19:55.500
Really? I'm a janitor again?
Come on!

19:55.502 --> 19:57.786
Oh, Mr. Deeks,
don't complain.

19:57.788 --> 19:59.504
It's a noble profession.

19:59.506 --> 20:02.957
And besides, this is
the perfect camouflage

20:02.959 --> 20:04.709
for you to slip in and out

20:04.711 --> 20:08.329
of Professor Hale's office
unnoticed.

20:08.331 --> 20:09.681
Also a fantastic way for you

20:09.683 --> 20:11.132
to amortize the price
of the disguise.

20:11.134 --> 20:14.803
I believe that's called
a win-win.

20:14.805 --> 20:16.471
Yeah, for you, maybe.

20:16.473 --> 20:17.689
That's a nice purse, Deeks.

20:17.691 --> 20:19.391
Yeah, it matches
your shoes.

20:19.393 --> 20:22.027
The damage from that kick must
have been worse than we thought.

20:22.029 --> 20:24.896
It's cute.

20:24.898 --> 20:27.115
Hetty, could I please have
a tool belt or something

20:27.117 --> 20:29.851
to wear with this? With,
like, a belt sander on it?

20:31.654 --> 20:33.705
Hey, nice pants.

20:37.961 --> 20:40.311
Guy up ahead is
Hale's TA, David.

20:40.313 --> 20:42.897
Copy.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.884
Hey, David.

20:45.886 --> 20:47.285
Yeah. You are...?

20:47.287 --> 20:50.705
Uh, Laura. I am in
Dr. Hale's History 101.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.058
I'm pretty sure
I'd remember you.

20:53.060 --> 20:55.894
Aren't there, like, 300
of us in that class?

20:55.896 --> 20:57.595
Still.

20:57.597 --> 20:59.597
Okay. Well, maybe
I shouldn't tell you this,

20:59.599 --> 21:01.433
'cause you're the
class TA and all,

21:01.435 --> 21:03.918
but, um, sometimes
I miss classes.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.237
A lot, actually.
Sorry.

21:06.239 --> 21:08.523
When I was an undergrad,
there were some classes

21:08.525 --> 21:10.692
I only went to on exam day.
Ah.

21:10.694 --> 21:12.660
What's your last name?
I'll check you in.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.329
Check me in?

21:14.331 --> 21:16.731
Extra credit for coming
to this thing.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.249
It's why you're here, right?

21:18.251 --> 21:22.537
Yeah, of course. Duh. Chomsky.

21:22.539 --> 21:24.422
There it is. Laura Chomsky.

21:24.424 --> 21:27.375
See? I'm not that memorable.

21:27.377 --> 21:29.094
You're not related
to Noam Chomsky?

21:29.096 --> 21:30.712
Yeah. He's my dad's
second cousin.

21:30.714 --> 21:32.964
His books changed my life.

21:32.966 --> 21:35.767
They're-they're why I stopped
skipping class.

21:35.769 --> 21:38.269
His potato salad
changed my life.

21:38.271 --> 21:41.389
Um, it's the reason why I don't
eat mayonnaise anymore.

21:41.391 --> 21:44.893
Family reunion, 1995.
Absolutely disgusting.

21:44.895 --> 21:46.561
A day which will live in infamy.

21:46.563 --> 21:49.280
Dr. Hale hosts some of us

21:49.282 --> 21:50.932
once a week at his house.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.234
The discussion gets
a lot more interesting

21:53.236 --> 21:54.536
than what you hear in class.

21:54.538 --> 21:56.571
It's supposed to be
for grad students only,

21:56.573 --> 21:58.740
but I'm sure he'd make
an exception.

21:58.742 --> 22:01.126
Um, I don't know.

22:01.128 --> 22:02.460
The bar is always well-stocked.

22:02.462 --> 22:03.912
Mm...

22:03.914 --> 22:05.330
We never serve
potato salad.

22:05.332 --> 22:06.331
Done.

22:06.333 --> 22:07.882
Okay, give me
your phone.

22:07.884 --> 22:10.585
All right.

22:11.387 --> 22:13.788
Here's my number.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.974
Text me and I'll send you
the details.

22:15.976 --> 22:17.008
Great, thanks.

22:17.010 --> 22:18.159
Just don't mention
to the professor

22:18.161 --> 22:19.144
all the classes
you've skipped.

22:19.146 --> 22:21.229
I will not.

22:21.231 --> 22:23.297
Um, speaking of which--
where is Dr. Hale?

22:23.299 --> 22:24.265
Oh, no, he doesn't

22:24.267 --> 22:25.266
come to these things.

22:25.268 --> 22:26.851
He gave up
on the Occupy Movement.

22:26.853 --> 22:27.969
Why?

22:27.971 --> 22:29.136
Well, last year
there were hundreds

22:29.138 --> 22:31.439
of protesters
and now there's what-- 20?

22:31.441 --> 22:33.158
Guess Occupy's
already over.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.642
Yeah.

22:35.644 --> 22:37.028
Okay, well, um,

22:37.030 --> 22:38.246
thank you.
Yeah, thank you.

22:38.248 --> 22:40.365
See you later.
I'll see you there.

22:48.624 --> 22:51.626
All right, I'm
in Professor Hale's office.

22:51.628 --> 22:55.346
Wow, looks like this guy
and Kensi share a decorator.

22:57.099 --> 23:01.970
All right, let's see
what he's not telling us.

23:02.822 --> 23:04.355
Eric, you ready for this?

23:04.357 --> 23:08.175
'Cause it's coming your way.
Oh, yeah.

23:08.177 --> 23:10.195
I-Is this a new computer?

23:12.031 --> 23:14.148
Uh...

23:14.150 --> 23:15.483
Gonna have to

23:15.485 --> 23:17.819
go with no on that one.

23:17.821 --> 23:20.321
Why?
Uh, there's nothing on it.

23:20.323 --> 23:21.372
That's odd.

23:21.374 --> 23:23.124
See what else you can find.

23:23.126 --> 23:25.410
I'll keep digging...
literally digging.

23:25.412 --> 23:27.328
Think I probably should've
brought a shovel.

23:27.330 --> 23:29.363
I was in that office.

23:29.365 --> 23:31.532
You should've brought a backhoe.

23:36.505 --> 23:38.223
Red Tide?

23:38.225 --> 23:41.142
Unless Albert Pujols is having
a really bad day.

23:41.144 --> 23:42.176
Red Tide!

23:43.964 --> 23:46.147
Red Tide!

24:14.543 --> 24:16.177
Hey, hey...

24:24.587 --> 24:27.405
Turn over.

24:27.407 --> 24:30.925
Put your hands
behind your back.

24:30.927 --> 24:32.259
Uh... guys?

24:32.261 --> 24:33.611
Wee kind of busy, Deeks.

24:33.613 --> 24:35.863
Yeah, but I found something.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.765
Yeah, it better be
a smoking gun.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.433
I can do better than that.

24:39.435 --> 24:40.935
I got a ticking bomb.

24:41.870 --> 24:43.705
I got an explosive device.

24:43.707 --> 24:47.458
Dynamite, propane and wires.

24:47.460 --> 24:48.543
You see a timer?

24:48.545 --> 24:49.777
No, but it's got
a cell phone trigger.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.162
This thing could go
at any second.

24:51.164 --> 24:53.047
We got to get people out
of that building.

24:53.049 --> 24:54.666
With pleasure.

24:54.668 --> 24:56.283
Bomb squad's on its way.

24:56.285 --> 24:57.502
You get out, too, Deeks.

24:57.504 --> 24:59.220
Copy that, I don't want to leave

24:59.222 --> 25:00.955
little Monty Junior, Junior
all alone

25:00.957 --> 25:02.590
on that future beach by himself.

25:02.592 --> 25:04.959
Let's go, people.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.294
Let's go, now, everybody out--
there's a bomb in the building.

25:07.296 --> 25:08.563
Come on, people, we got
to go right now.

25:08.565 --> 25:10.848
We got a bomb in the building--
everybody out!

25:10.850 --> 25:13.601
Hey, David said
Professor Hale

25:13.603 --> 25:15.403
never comes to
these rallies.

25:15.405 --> 25:16.571
Well, maybe someone knew that
and counted

25:16.573 --> 25:17.822
on him being in his office.

25:17.824 --> 25:19.607
Hale's phone is turned off.

25:19.609 --> 25:20.775
Somebody wants him dead.

25:20.777 --> 25:21.909
We'll check his house.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.310
Okay.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.758
The professor's car is
still in the driveway.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.010
Maybe this guy poked
the wrong hornet's nest.

25:39.012 --> 25:40.428
There's a right
hornet's nest?

25:40.430 --> 25:41.596
That's a good point.

25:47.052 --> 25:48.836
Whoa.

25:48.838 --> 25:51.305
That was really
the wrong hornet's nest.

26:04.946 --> 26:07.113
Maybe I should
be a fireman.

26:07.115 --> 26:08.531
Fire's hot.

26:08.533 --> 26:10.683
And they don't
firemen shoot guns.

26:10.685 --> 26:12.184
I mean
for my daughter's school thing.

26:12.186 --> 26:13.852
Instead of an astronaut.

26:13.854 --> 26:15.321
Kids love firemen.

26:15.323 --> 26:18.524
What did you find out about
the bomb in Hale's office?

26:18.526 --> 26:21.627
Updated version of the same type
used by the Gun Barrel Party.

26:21.629 --> 26:24.413
Eric found a death threat from
the GBP on Hale's hard drive.

26:24.415 --> 26:26.532
So Hale's doing research
for his book on the GBP,

26:26.534 --> 26:28.334
obviously finds something
they didn't want found.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.670
Whoever's reviving the group
sent Hale a threat,

26:30.672 --> 26:33.306
he didn't stop whatever
it was he was doing,

26:33.308 --> 26:34.507
so they blew him up.

26:34.509 --> 26:35.925
They tried to--
we still don't know

26:35.927 --> 26:37.810
for sure if he
was in there.

26:37.812 --> 26:39.812
We need to know what Hale found
out about the Gun Barrel Party.

26:39.814 --> 26:41.180
Anything else
on that hard drive?

26:41.182 --> 26:42.715
Eric's still looking.

26:42.717 --> 26:44.734
How does Dean Albertson's murder
fit into all this?

26:44.736 --> 26:47.320
I wish I knew.

26:48.238 --> 26:49.939
- What do you got, Nell?
- Well,

26:49.941 --> 26:52.441
it turns out one of the
members of Red Tide you busted,

26:52.443 --> 26:54.076
he's a grad student of Hale's--

26:54.078 --> 26:55.528
Alan Sanderson.

26:55.530 --> 26:56.662
According to his transcript,

26:56.664 --> 26:59.332
Hale gave Alan a "D"
last semester.

26:59.334 --> 27:02.084
That's motive to plant a bomb
in the professor's desk?

27:02.086 --> 27:03.619
When I was a kid
if we had a bad teacher,

27:03.621 --> 27:04.954
we put a tack on their seat.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.290
This isn't Sanderson's
first offense.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.626
Charges predate his suspected
involvement with Red Tide.

27:10.628 --> 27:13.212
Assault, drugs, drunk driving.

27:13.214 --> 27:14.864
His parents bailed him out.

27:14.866 --> 27:16.749
His father owns
Sanderson Genesis.

27:16.751 --> 27:18.684
It's one of the largest
construction companies

27:18.686 --> 27:19.752
in Southern California.

27:19.754 --> 27:20.803
Yeah, they just got the contract

27:20.805 --> 27:22.138
to build
the new football stadium.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.590
So we tracked the serial numbers
on the dynamite

27:24.592 --> 27:26.776
from the bomb in Hale's office.

27:26.778 --> 27:29.278
It was reported missing
from a building site.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.864
Guess what company's working
on the construction?

27:31.866 --> 27:32.982
Daddy's?

27:32.984 --> 27:34.267
Circle takes the square.

27:34.269 --> 27:35.985
Here's the scary part.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.103
We estimate that the bomb
in Hale's office

27:38.105 --> 27:39.905
and the blast
at his house account

27:39.907 --> 27:42.658
for only a fraction
of the missing explosives.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.910
There's a good chance
there are more bombs out there.

27:44.912 --> 27:46.128
Send Sanderson
to the boatshed.

27:46.130 --> 27:47.630
Okay.
Sam and I are on our way.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.782
I'll talk to Hale's T.A.,
find out what he knows.

27:49.784 --> 27:52.117
Deeks, see if Albertson's
girlfriend knows Sanderson.

27:52.119 --> 27:53.502
Maybe we can tie him to this.

27:53.504 --> 27:54.904
Uh, or I got a better idea.

27:54.906 --> 27:57.306
I could talk to Sanderson,
you can go talk to Leah.

27:57.308 --> 27:59.091
You afraid she's
gonna kick you again?

27:59.093 --> 28:00.977
Maybe.

28:00.979 --> 28:02.795
I tell you what.

28:02.797 --> 28:04.730
I'll rock, paper, scissors you
for it.

28:05.682 --> 28:07.850
Okay.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.068
You ready for this?

28:09.070 --> 28:10.186
I'm always ready.
Round two, baby.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.087
Let's do it.

28:11.089 --> 28:12.772
Boom.

28:12.774 --> 28:14.423
Rock beats paper-- I win.

28:14.425 --> 28:15.641
You win?

28:15.643 --> 28:16.609
Paper covers rock.

28:16.611 --> 28:18.327
What about
your East Coast rules?

28:18.329 --> 28:20.145
You said you wanted to play
West Coast style.

28:20.147 --> 28:21.580
You...

28:21.582 --> 28:23.249
I didn't... we're...

28:23.251 --> 28:25.935
Try and do a
guy a favor.

28:25.937 --> 28:28.921
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

28:30.674 --> 28:32.291
You do know <i>Art of War</i>

28:32.293 --> 28:34.293
is Sam's favorite book, right?

28:34.295 --> 28:35.594
It's all part
of my master plan.

28:35.596 --> 28:37.880
Don't you worry.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.598
Okay.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.683
Let's go Sun Tzu.

28:40.685 --> 28:43.969
What? I do--
I have a master plan here.

28:45.338 --> 28:46.689
You broke my nose.

28:46.691 --> 28:48.474
You tried to hit me with
a Louisville Slugger.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.809
That's police brutality.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.527
Do I look like
a cop to you?

28:51.529 --> 28:53.279
Does this look
like a police station?

28:53.281 --> 28:55.514
I want my lawyer.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.233
You want
your lawyer?

28:57.235 --> 29:00.319
This isn't like all the other
times you were in trouble, Al.

29:00.321 --> 29:01.704
Red Tide
has been listed

29:01.706 --> 29:03.739
by the government as
a terrorist organization.

29:03.741 --> 29:05.691
Means you're a threat
to national security.

29:05.693 --> 29:08.377
That means you're ours
until we say otherwise.

29:09.579 --> 29:12.415
People like you are what

29:12.417 --> 29:15.801
makes people like me necessary.

29:15.803 --> 29:17.887
People like him?

29:17.889 --> 29:20.139
Does he mean
trust fund anarchists?

29:20.141 --> 29:21.173
I think he means people who have

29:21.175 --> 29:23.726
no idea how much trouble
they're in.

29:26.897 --> 29:29.815
Tell us about the bomb
in Dr. Hale's office, Al.

29:29.817 --> 29:31.817
What bomb?

29:35.021 --> 29:37.440
So, what kind
of cop are you?

29:37.442 --> 29:40.242
NCIS-- it's a federal agency.

29:40.244 --> 29:41.994
Have you found Dr. Hale?

29:41.996 --> 29:44.113
Not yet.

29:45.616 --> 29:47.950
Were you guys close?

29:47.952 --> 29:49.401
He saved me.

29:49.403 --> 29:52.088
How?

29:52.090 --> 29:54.540
My dad was basically murdered
a few years ago.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.842
When something
like that happens,

29:56.844 --> 29:59.378
it can push you
to a dark place.

29:59.380 --> 30:00.679
What happened to him?

30:00.681 --> 30:03.466
The insurance company denied him

30:03.468 --> 30:05.417
a treatment
that would've saved his life.

30:05.419 --> 30:08.521
Just so they could make a
couple extra dollars profit.

30:08.523 --> 30:09.555
The stuff Dr. Hale

30:09.557 --> 30:11.056
was saying in class
started making

30:11.058 --> 30:13.559
a whole lot more sense
after that.

30:13.561 --> 30:16.312
I talked to him about it and he
kind of took me under his wing.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.732
I don't think I could've gotten
through it without him.

30:21.902 --> 30:23.369
He was writing a book

30:23.371 --> 30:25.955
about the Gun Barrel Party,
right?

30:25.957 --> 30:29.041
Not that I know of.

30:32.712 --> 30:34.663
I don't recognize him.

30:34.665 --> 30:36.832
Maybe it's the busted nose.

30:37.968 --> 30:40.970
All right, try this.

30:42.389 --> 30:43.672
That's him.

30:43.674 --> 30:46.008
No, I never saw him before,
but I know the guy next to him

30:46.010 --> 30:47.009
on the right.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.094
He came out to see
Dean a few times.

30:49.096 --> 30:51.313
That's Professor Hale.

30:51.315 --> 30:53.983
No, Dean called him, um...

30:53.985 --> 30:55.901
Johnson.

30:56.736 --> 30:58.521
You're sure?

30:58.523 --> 31:00.022
Yeah.

31:01.241 --> 31:04.810
Oliver Johnson was a member
of the Gun Barrel Party.

31:04.812 --> 31:06.529
Now, I thought
he died years ago.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.030
Well, according to this,

31:08.032 --> 31:09.849
Johnson was one of the four
members of the GBP

31:09.851 --> 31:11.083
who were killed when

31:11.085 --> 31:12.084
bombs they were building

31:12.086 --> 31:13.752
exploded at the cabin in Oregon.

31:13.754 --> 31:15.337
He could've survived--
I mean, I saw a guy blow

31:15.339 --> 31:17.173
himself up at a carnival
once-- Human Bomb.

31:17.175 --> 31:20.158
It was almost as cool as
this monkey they had riding

31:20.160 --> 31:21.377
on the back of a dog.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.595
He had these little chaps,
this little vest,

31:22.597 --> 31:24.380
cute little hat.
I mean, he was hilarious.

31:24.382 --> 31:25.531
Hmm, maybe not.

31:25.533 --> 31:27.666
No, it was-- they put
a clip up on YouTube.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.185
No, no, I mean Johnson's death.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.854
It says here that the hikers
came upon the scene

31:31.856 --> 31:35.024
and notified authorities weeks
after it had happened.

31:35.026 --> 31:38.360
So with the explosion,
then the fire,

31:38.362 --> 31:40.563
animal scavengers and the
natural decomposition,

31:40.565 --> 31:43.566
the bodies would be
very difficult to identify.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.700
Let me try something.

31:44.702 --> 31:47.736
I'm gonna run
age progression software.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.998
Professor Hale
is Oliver Johnson.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.249
How did we miss that?

32:00.251 --> 32:02.668
Those 40 years
took a toll on him.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.870
That and the whole
"he died in the '70s" thing.

32:04.872 --> 32:06.673
- Well, there is that.
- And I just got word

32:06.674 --> 32:07.806
from crime scene techs.

32:07.808 --> 32:10.175
The professor's body
was not in the house.

32:11.678 --> 32:14.647
Human Bomb does it again.

32:27.689 --> 32:30.691
We know Professor Hale
is Oliver Johnson.

32:30.693 --> 32:32.676
He getting back into
the terrorism business

32:32.678 --> 32:33.861
with you and your buddies?

32:33.863 --> 32:35.779
The men who founded this country
were terrorists,

32:35.781 --> 32:37.865
but you call them heroes.

32:37.867 --> 32:40.034
I must've skipped that day in
history class where they talked

32:40.036 --> 32:43.070
about Thomas Jefferson
blowing up innocent people.

32:43.072 --> 32:46.356
Were you there when they talked
about John F. Kennedy?

32:46.358 --> 32:49.159
He said, "Those that make
peaceful revolution impossible

32:49.161 --> 32:52.079
only make violent
revolution inevitable."

32:52.081 --> 32:53.881
Your professor teach you that?

32:53.883 --> 32:55.599
Yeah, he taught me
a lot of things.

32:55.601 --> 32:57.501
Did he teach you
that Kennedy also said,

32:57.503 --> 32:59.803
"Only respect for the law
makes it possible

32:59.805 --> 33:02.506
for free men to dwell together
in peace and progress"?

33:06.428 --> 33:07.761
Well, he taught me about
the Fifth Amendment

33:07.763 --> 33:09.096
to the Constitution.

33:09.098 --> 33:10.981
So I think I'll exercise
my right

33:10.983 --> 33:12.399
to remain silent now.

33:12.401 --> 33:13.550
What do you got, Eric?

33:13.552 --> 33:14.852
Looks like our professor

33:14.854 --> 33:16.353
might be running again.

33:21.826 --> 33:23.077
All right, go ahead.

33:23.079 --> 33:24.695
His neighbor reported
his car stolen.

33:24.697 --> 33:27.247
Police spotted and
then lost it in Culver City.

33:27.249 --> 33:29.750
LAPD thinks there's a
print center down there

33:29.752 --> 33:31.251
that makes
fake IDs.

33:31.253 --> 33:34.038
I checked security cam
footage from the parking lot.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.507
And it looks like
Hale picked one up.

33:36.509 --> 33:38.241
Sending some of the video
to your phone.

33:38.243 --> 33:39.293
Where is he now?

33:39.295 --> 33:40.794
I'm running
a Kaleidoscope search.

33:40.796 --> 33:41.795
All right.

33:41.797 --> 33:42.763
Keep us in the loop.

33:42.765 --> 33:43.797
Will do.

33:49.137 --> 33:50.471
There's your mentor,

33:50.473 --> 33:52.022
getting himself
a new identity.

33:52.024 --> 33:54.892
He's running away,
just like he did 40 years ago.

33:54.894 --> 33:57.144
Leaving you holding the bag.

33:57.146 --> 33:59.530
He'll be sittin' pretty
while you rot away at Gitmo.

33:59.532 --> 34:01.932
You can't do that.

34:01.934 --> 34:03.484
Apparently Professor
Hale didn't teach you

34:03.486 --> 34:04.768
about current events.

34:04.770 --> 34:07.788
You should read the National
Defense Authorization Act.

34:08.873 --> 34:10.324
We <i>can</i> do that.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.127
You still want to exercise

34:13.129 --> 34:15.379
your right to remain silent?

34:17.498 --> 34:20.217
Sanderson said Hale has
a storage unit in Hollywood.

34:20.219 --> 34:21.385
I sent you the address.

34:21.387 --> 34:22.753
Checking
security cameras.

34:22.755 --> 34:24.004
Well, check it fast.

34:24.005 --> 34:25.806
That's where he
keeps the explosives.

34:25.808 --> 34:26.907
Look, according to Sanderson,

34:26.909 --> 34:28.291
Hale plans on blowing up

34:28.293 --> 34:30.427
a Southern California
Fortune 500 company.

34:30.429 --> 34:31.678
The kid didn't know which one.

34:31.679 --> 34:34.348
That makes at least ten
to 15 possible targets,

34:34.350 --> 34:37.400
but if you factor in satellite
offices, it means...

34:37.402 --> 34:39.268
If we lose him, people die.

34:39.271 --> 34:42.188
Hale is at the storage
facility now.

35:07.382 --> 35:09.299
Deeks, you know that thing's
full of dynamite, right?

35:09.301 --> 35:10.434
I just hope he knows it.

35:10.436 --> 35:12.052
I don't think he's gonna stop.

35:20.145 --> 35:21.612
Freeze!

35:21.614 --> 35:23.030
Damn it!
Guys, next alley!

35:23.032 --> 35:23.947
Roof?

35:23.949 --> 35:25.782
Beats going around.

35:32.740 --> 35:34.908
Don't move.

35:34.910 --> 35:37.127
Put 'em up!

35:38.046 --> 35:39.663
The Gun Barrel Party
is finished.

35:39.665 --> 35:42.633
Looks like Morgan's not
the only one retiring today.

35:44.419 --> 35:46.170
I still don't know
which one's Morgan.

35:47.005 --> 35:49.506
Let's go.

35:53.228 --> 35:55.762
I wasn't at the cabin
when it exploded.

35:55.764 --> 35:58.315
Police found my things
at the wreckage

35:58.317 --> 36:00.100
and assumed
I was dead.

36:00.102 --> 36:02.319
I saw it
as an opportunity.

36:03.605 --> 36:05.656
I'd realized that

36:05.658 --> 36:08.192
both the generation
in charge of this country

36:08.194 --> 36:10.494
and my own
were lost causes.

36:10.496 --> 36:11.745
I wanted to
reach the ones

36:11.747 --> 36:14.248
who weren't
born yet.

36:14.250 --> 36:16.066
So I got myself
a new identity,

36:16.068 --> 36:17.918
went back
to school

36:17.920 --> 36:19.703
and became a
history teacher.

36:21.956 --> 36:24.341
What made you decide to get
your hands dirty again?

36:24.343 --> 36:26.426
I realized that
the current generation

36:26.428 --> 36:28.745
needed a more direct approach.

36:28.747 --> 36:30.931
Big Business takes
over this country

36:30.933 --> 36:32.766
while they tweet about

36:32.768 --> 36:36.787
the latest episode of
<i>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.</i>

36:36.789 --> 36:38.305
So you came out of retirement

36:38.307 --> 36:41.091
and recruited Sanderson and his
anarchist buddies to help you.

36:42.060 --> 36:44.194
What about Dean Albertson?

36:45.029 --> 36:47.597
That was a terrible accident.

36:47.599 --> 36:51.268
I went out to ask him
to join us.

36:51.270 --> 36:53.620
I didn't realize
his mind was going.

36:53.622 --> 36:55.572
He pulled a knife.

36:56.541 --> 36:58.775
We struggled,
he fell on it.

36:58.777 --> 37:00.911
Nothing I could do.

37:00.913 --> 37:02.496
Except let your friend die

37:02.498 --> 37:04.464
so that you didn't
draw attention to yourself.

37:04.466 --> 37:07.050
But we showed up
in your office anyway.

37:07.052 --> 37:09.086
So you faked a death threat,

37:09.088 --> 37:12.589
blew things up to cover
your tracks as you ran away.

37:12.591 --> 37:16.843
To return and fight another day.

37:16.845 --> 37:19.296
Your fighting days are over.

37:19.298 --> 37:20.597
Maybe.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.634
But I sowed many seeds

37:24.636 --> 37:26.903
during those years
in the classroom.

37:26.905 --> 37:32.109
Some... might yet take root.

37:43.338 --> 37:45.539
There you are, Mr. Callen.

37:48.593 --> 37:50.544
Hale confessed to the
crimes he committed

37:50.546 --> 37:53.297
with the Gun
Barrel Party.

37:53.299 --> 37:56.183
In addition to the explosives
he was carrying,

37:56.185 --> 37:58.352
we found photos and blueprints
in his car.

37:58.354 --> 37:59.553
Mm.

37:59.555 --> 38:01.471
He was planning
an attack,

38:01.473 --> 38:04.358
and we have enough to put him
away for the rest of his life.

38:04.360 --> 38:08.028
And yet you don't seem
entirely satisfied.

38:10.348 --> 38:11.815
It's just something Hale said,

38:11.817 --> 38:14.117
about influencing kids.

38:15.570 --> 38:17.237
How much damage
could he have done?

38:20.124 --> 38:23.960
Did you ever hear of...
Dietrich Eckart?

38:23.962 --> 38:28.031
What, uh...
Hitler's mentor?

38:28.033 --> 38:31.251
Yes.

38:31.253 --> 38:32.869
Eckart's twisted beliefs

38:32.871 --> 38:35.672
molded Hitler into the monster
he became.

38:35.674 --> 38:37.174
Without him,

38:37.176 --> 38:40.227
there might never have
been a Holocaust.

38:40.229 --> 38:42.479
<i>That's just it.</i>

38:43.981 --> 38:45.432
<i>Hale taught...</i>
<i>how many classes,</i>

38:45.434 --> 38:46.600
<i>for how many years?</i>

38:46.602 --> 38:50.437
<i>Touched the lives</i>
<i>of how many students?</i>

38:50.439 --> 38:53.440
<i>He had the potential</i>
<i>to be the wrong influence</i>

38:53.442 --> 38:54.941
<i>at the right moment,</i>

38:54.943 --> 38:56.943
for someone at a tipping point.

39:00.115 --> 39:02.666
One nudge from him, and some...

39:02.668 --> 39:04.067
<i>confused, lonely kid</i>

39:04.069 --> 39:06.370
<i>goes down a very dark path.</i>

39:07.906 --> 39:10.173
<i>That may be,</i>

39:10.175 --> 39:12.909
but I'd like to think that

39:12.911 --> 39:15.095
the opposite is also true.

39:23.771 --> 39:25.355
Hi, David.

39:25.357 --> 39:27.140
Hi.

39:27.142 --> 39:30.310
Just wondering if you wanted
to go for coffee, talk?

39:36.951 --> 39:38.285
Okay.

39:39.137 --> 39:41.071
Okay.

39:41.073 --> 39:43.256
I'll grab
my coat.

39:55.336 --> 39:57.671
<i>A good friend</i>
<i>at just the right time...</i>

39:57.673 --> 39:59.622
Ready?

39:59.624 --> 40:02.225
<i>...can make all the</i>
<i>difference in the world.</i>

40:02.227 --> 40:03.810
Speaking of which,

40:03.812 --> 40:06.313
all your friends
are just out there,

40:06.315 --> 40:09.850
enjoying Mr. Morgan's
retirement party.

40:09.852 --> 40:11.334
A little, um,

40:11.336 --> 40:13.820
social interaction
wouldn't hurt.

40:14.972 --> 40:16.523
I'm interacting with you.

40:18.243 --> 40:19.476
And when I'm gone?

40:19.478 --> 40:22.412
You know, I
will retire

40:22.414 --> 40:23.997
one of these days, Mr. Callen,

40:23.999 --> 40:25.782
and when I do,

40:25.784 --> 40:29.503
I don't want to be thinking
about you alone.

40:29.505 --> 40:30.871
He won't be.

40:30.873 --> 40:32.756
He'll be right next
to me in the stands

40:32.758 --> 40:34.207
at one of those
football games.

40:34.209 --> 40:35.459
My man!

40:35.461 --> 40:36.877
Thank you.
You're welcome.

40:36.879 --> 40:39.045
That is, if you have time
for football games.

40:39.047 --> 40:40.180
Yeah?

40:40.182 --> 40:41.848
Because you two will be serving
on the cabinet

40:41.850 --> 40:43.767
in the Blye-Jones
administration.

40:43.769 --> 40:46.970
And somebody's got to help me
walk Monty Junior, Junior.

40:46.972 --> 40:48.522
Deeks, you're walking
your own dog.

40:48.524 --> 40:49.973
Fair enough. Wait...

40:49.975 --> 40:51.942
is that the last piece of cake?

40:51.944 --> 40:53.226
Yep.

40:53.228 --> 40:54.444
Mm-hmm.

40:54.446 --> 40:55.562
Uh...

40:55.564 --> 40:58.315
I'll, uh, rock, paper, scissors
you for it.

40:58.317 --> 40:59.733
Oh...

41:02.187 --> 41:03.987
Okay.

41:03.989 --> 41:06.406
But this time, when I win,

41:06.408 --> 41:07.574
you gotta shave your head.

41:07.576 --> 41:08.658
Shave my head?

41:08.660 --> 41:10.126
Yeah.

41:10.128 --> 41:11.745
And the eyebrows.
Done.

41:11.747 --> 41:13.713
Ah!
Okay.

41:13.715 --> 41:14.798
West Coast rules.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.966
West Coast rules.

41:15.968 --> 41:17.867
I just want you to know
that I am gonna be, uh,

41:17.869 --> 41:19.052
throwing rock.

41:19.054 --> 41:20.253
You ready?

41:22.173 --> 41:24.007
Go.

41:24.258 --> 41:25.875
Ah...

41:25.877 --> 41:28.061
Rock beats scissors.

41:28.063 --> 41:29.012
A little chocolate cake.

41:29.014 --> 41:30.597
How's it taste?
It all right?

41:30.599 --> 41:32.182
Mm-hmm.

41:32.184 --> 41:34.384
"All war is based
on deception."

41:34.386 --> 41:36.653
One of the main principles
of Sun Tzu.

41:36.655 --> 41:37.904
And when you're dealing
with somebody

41:37.906 --> 41:39.906
who knows the <i>Art of War</i>
as well as you do,

41:39.908 --> 41:41.691
I guess the best deception
sometimes is just

41:41.693 --> 41:43.827
telling the truth.

41:45.113 --> 41:46.830
Who moved the party in here?

41:46.832 --> 41:49.749
Wait, Sam, how was the thing
at your daughter's school?

41:49.751 --> 41:50.784
Oh, yeah. Were you the, uh,

41:50.786 --> 41:52.285
coolest dad?

41:52.287 --> 41:54.204
I was the second coolest dad.

41:54.206 --> 41:55.372
Uh, who could impress

41:55.374 --> 41:56.540
a bunch of kids
more than

41:56.542 --> 41:58.262
the father who came
dressed as an astronaut?

41:59.990 --> 42:02.908
The guy dressed
as a Navy SEAL.
