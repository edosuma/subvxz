00:17.267 --> 00:20.186
Once upon a time,
fairy tales were awesome.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.731
We know, you don't believe us.

00:22.814 --> 00:26.359
You think fairy tales are cute
and pink and full of fairies.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.154
-Well, they're not.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.197
-Real fairy tales are scary.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.995
Follow two children
as they venture off into a dark tale.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.496
-A scary tale.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.331
-A strange tale.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.667
A… Wait a minute.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.919
-Are you even old enough for this?

00:45.003 --> 00:46.921
You really think you can handle it?

00:59.059 --> 01:03.480
Once upon a time, a young girl emerged
from the deep dark woods

01:03.563 --> 01:05.523
feeling that things were looking up.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.613
Yes, she still thought
her brother was dead…

01:11.696 --> 01:14.157
-…but she had made it to safety.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.784
Or so she thought.

01:25.752 --> 01:29.047
Such a sweet coo.

01:32.258 --> 01:36.846
This is fine. Nothing to think about here.
Totally normal place to have a party.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.016
It's going to be really fun, and maybe…

01:40.100 --> 01:41.810
maybe we'll hold hands.

01:41.893 --> 01:42.769
Maybe.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.108
That place looks like
it's haunted and smelly.

01:48.191 --> 01:51.694
I wouldn't go anywhere near it,
and I sleep in a half-empty skull.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.739
Oh, I don't wanna know
what it's half-full of.

01:54.823 --> 01:55.657
Quiet!

01:56.324 --> 01:59.494
While Gretel wrestled
her common sense into submission,

02:00.787 --> 02:03.373
things weren't looking
any better for Hansel…

02:04.207 --> 02:07.544
Although you have won our bet,
you will see there is nothing of value

02:07.627 --> 02:09.295
in front of that fireplace.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.840
Perhaps a stool or an old rug or…

02:11.923 --> 02:14.134
-Hansel!

02:14.217 --> 02:17.178
-Hello.
-Nothing of value, you say? Hmm.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.722
-Indeed.

02:19.806 --> 02:23.434
I'm sorry.
I know the library is off-limits, but--

02:23.518 --> 02:24.853
What have you done?!

02:24.936 --> 02:28.106
You shouldn't be in here!
You're supposed to be in your room!

02:28.189 --> 02:29.149
It's a rule!

02:29.232 --> 02:33.653
What a coincidence that this boy
would be right in front of the fireplace.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.656
Oh…

02:36.739 --> 02:38.658
A superlious vintage.

02:38.741 --> 02:41.327
Innocent, without a trace of guile.

02:42.078 --> 02:45.456
Ugh, you smell
like burnt hair and hot chimneys.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.000
Oh, well, thank you.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.543
Oh. Ugh.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.296
It's pure goodness. Ugh! So good! Ugh.

02:51.379 --> 02:55.175
It makes me sick! If I were to touch you,
I might not ever get the smell off.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.676
-Oh!
-Irregardlessly,

02:56.759 --> 02:59.596
-I am glad that this boy is mine.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.513
-What?

03:00.597 --> 03:03.558
Sadly, tsk, I cannot take him right now.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.560
There's a certain wolf I must collect.

03:05.643 --> 03:09.522
Apparently, he pretended
to be somebody's grandmother.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.732
Ah… Can you imagine?

03:10.815 --> 03:13.985
I mean, what kind of idiot
would fall for that?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.321
Lord Meister?

03:17.697 --> 03:18.531
-Boy…

03:18.615 --> 03:21.075
…you will report to Hell
in three days' time

03:21.159 --> 03:22.118
to begin your…

03:22.202 --> 03:24.579
…eternity of suffering!

03:25.371 --> 03:26.247
Hmm?

03:27.582 --> 03:29.459
-And I will make sure you are…

03:29.542 --> 03:31.628
-Ah!
-…in unbearable pain forever.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.380
And it will never, ever stop.
Even if you say…

03:34.464 --> 03:36.591
-…"Pretty please with a cherry on top."

03:36.674 --> 03:37.926
-Ah! Ah!

03:40.220 --> 03:45.183
No! I know I wasn't supposed to be
in the library, but I'm a good boy!

03:45.266 --> 03:46.684
I learned all the rules!

03:46.768 --> 03:49.729
And Lord Meister would never
let anything bad happen to me!

03:49.812 --> 03:51.731
About that…

03:51.814 --> 03:54.734
-Oh, my dear boy.

03:54.817 --> 03:57.654
Your beloved Lord Meister lost you

03:58.404 --> 04:00.156
to me… in a bet!

04:01.741 --> 04:04.369
But I was good.

04:08.456 --> 04:11.584
Ah, these are the moments
that make life worthwhile.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.295
I'll see you in three days.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.513
-Don't make me come looking for you.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.223
-You'll regret it.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.225
And so will your sister.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.893
-Gretel! No!

04:29.936 --> 04:31.980
You weren't supposed to be here.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.022
It's a rule.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.025
So this is really all your fault.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.443
My fault? But I…

04:38.820 --> 04:40.029
Aw.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.088
It's fine. It's fine.

04:57.171 --> 05:00.800
That young man will be here,
and everything will be perfect.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.802
There might even be dancing.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.559
It doesn't look like much of a party.

05:10.268 --> 05:13.146
-You'd think he'd have cleaned up the…

05:13.229 --> 05:14.188
…skulls.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.859
-Ah!
-Oh!

05:17.942 --> 05:21.779
What are you screaming for?
You're the one who didn't knock.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.365
I… I'm sorry.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.908
I'm here for the party?

05:26.617 --> 05:29.245
Oh, uh, my son's party.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.664
Oh, right, of course.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.416
You're one of my son's vict--

05:34.250 --> 05:35.668
friends.

05:35.752 --> 05:39.672
Victfriends… is a word I just made up.

05:39.756 --> 05:43.760
-Um… I… Is this the wrong day?

05:43.843 --> 05:46.888
Oh, no, no. You're just early, dear.
Have a seat…

05:49.599 --> 05:50.558
-…somewhere.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.978
Or maybe just stand.

05:54.062 --> 05:57.190
It is hard to be hospitable
in here, isn't it? 

05:57.273 --> 06:00.610
Now, how about some refreshments?

06:00.693 --> 06:03.780
-Let's see, fizzy denture water…

06:03.863 --> 06:06.699
…floating eyeball, rat tea?

06:06.783 --> 06:08.743
-Uh…

06:08.826 --> 06:11.162
No, thank you. I'm not thirsty.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.499
Gaze upon
the mystic eye of--

06:14.582 --> 06:15.792
-Oh no!

06:15.875 --> 06:19.504
Oh, that looks so painful.
Let me help you get out of those chains.

06:19.587 --> 06:23.966
No, no, no, no, just be a dear
and hop up on that table to wait.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.428
These are really digging into your ankles.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.222
-Who did this to you?
-What?

06:29.305 --> 06:31.599
Oh, I did.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.394
Yes, it helps me build up my calf muscles.

06:34.477 --> 06:38.231
-I'm going to be a figure skater.
-Do you know where the key is?

06:38.856 --> 06:40.900
Or do you have a chicken bone?

06:41.526 --> 06:44.278
-Stop moving, I'm trying to help you.

06:44.779 --> 06:48.491
Why would you help me?
What do you care, huh?

06:48.574 --> 06:49.659
You're in pain.

06:49.742 --> 06:53.037
Only a monster would watch
someone suffer and do nothing.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.789
Then…

06:55.456 --> 06:56.457
Then…

06:56.541 --> 06:59.127
I am a monster!

07:01.003 --> 07:02.672
I'm sorry!

07:02.755 --> 07:05.383
I'm so sorry!

07:05.466 --> 07:09.429
I've seen so much suffering
and done nothing.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.057
You like my son, don't you?

07:13.891 --> 07:17.270
-You shouldn't. He's not what he seems.

07:17.353 --> 07:20.690
He's a fiend, a murderer, a warlock!

07:20.773 --> 07:23.276
He can't be the same young man.

07:23.359 --> 07:26.946
He's so nice and… and handsome.

07:27.029 --> 07:31.325
He steals the souls of young girls
to power his magical golden twine.

07:31.909 --> 07:34.078
Then he uses it to fix things for people,

07:34.162 --> 07:36.789
but only to trick them,
to earn their trust,

07:36.873 --> 07:39.876
to lure them in, to steal their souls,

07:39.959 --> 07:42.712
to power his twine, to lure them in,

07:42.795 --> 07:45.465
to steal their souls, to power his…

07:45.548 --> 07:48.384
Now that I think about it,
it's a bit of a vicious circle.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.720
No, no, no, no, this isn't possible.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.890
Oh, he's gotten away with it
for a hundred years.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.476
But his dark magic keeps him young.

07:56.559 --> 08:01.063
And it also erases
everyone's memories of his victims.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.233
-No one remembers they ever existed.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.569
But it's all my fault.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.530
I taught him this magic.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.867
-And now I'm his prisoner.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.328
-Why are you telling me this?

08:15.411 --> 08:17.830
-Oh, you were kind.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.917
No one has ever tried to help me before.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.880
Oh, I can't bear to see him hurt you
the way he hurt all the others.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.258
I deserve to be hurt.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.468
I was stupid.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.679
I followed my heart instead of my head,

08:33.763 --> 08:35.306
and it led me here.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.102
I should just give up.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.146
I let my brother be killed.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.023
Now I can join him.

08:45.191 --> 08:50.154
My child, your brother Hansel

08:50.238 --> 08:52.406
is not dead.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.283
-What?

08:54.367 --> 08:57.662
I saw him die! How do you know his name?

08:57.745 --> 09:00.164
Don't question me!
I'm obviously a witch, girl!

09:00.248 --> 09:03.042
See the pointy nose and the wart? Behold!

09:04.377 --> 09:06.963
-Oh…

09:08.047 --> 09:10.925
The bowl of scrying.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.725
I might as well go to the Devil.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.812
-I'm bad. I'll always be bad.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.273
No one has ever cared about me.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.691
Except Gretel.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.068
And she'll never wanna see me again.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.823
You can't come with me, Jehorsephat.

09:33.906 --> 09:37.827
Stay here where you can get fed
and get your nose patted every day,

09:37.910 --> 09:38.911
like you deserve.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.585
-Oh, and if you get a chance,

09:45.668 --> 09:48.004
kick Lord Meister right in the butt.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.889
Ugh, how could things get any worse? Wah!

10:02.143 --> 10:04.812
He needs me! I have to go to him.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.607
Yes! Do it! Get out of here!

10:07.690 --> 10:09.942
Run away before my son gets back!

10:10.026 --> 10:13.446
-Right this way.
-It's too late! Hide!

10:18.326 --> 10:20.620
Here we are, Hannah. Come on in.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.581
Oh, hello, son.

10:24.373 --> 10:25.499
Um…

10:25.583 --> 10:27.251
Where are the other guests?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.053
Oh, you'll join them, soon enough.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.555
Zah!

10:43.184 --> 10:45.770
Your soul is mine.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.275
Ugh!

10:51.359 --> 10:53.986
-That was so nasty!
-What's the problem?

10:54.070 --> 10:57.031
That guy just helped that bird
by pulling it out of that girl!

10:57.114 --> 10:58.616
He's a hero!

10:58.699 --> 11:01.285
Also, she should really
start chewing her food.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.288
That's not what happened!
That dove was her soul.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.290
Birds are souls?!

11:06.791 --> 11:09.710
Am I somebody's soul?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.754
Oh my God, I hope not.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.132
No, I mean the warlock
turned her soul into a dove,

11:15.216 --> 11:17.635
after draining its magic into some twine!

11:19.720 --> 11:21.597
Forget it. Can I move on?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.849
Maybe someday. With therapy.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.935
It's not gonna be easy.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.713
-Meanwhile--
-Why you interrupting?

11:53.796 --> 11:56.298
-I'm building tension!
-Okay.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.383
Who are you?

11:57.466 --> 11:58.718
Don't be afraid.

11:59.468 --> 12:02.763
I am your friend.
I'm sorry that I've been following you--

12:02.847 --> 12:05.558
Wait. You've been… following me?

12:05.641 --> 12:07.643
Perhaps we got off on the wrong foot.

12:07.727 --> 12:11.188
Hi, I'm Johannes,
and I can help you go to Hell.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.401
Oh, that did not sound better.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.779
I can find my own way there.
Why should I trust you anyway?

12:18.863 --> 12:20.114
You definitely shouldn't.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.993
Trusting strangers hasn't worked out
great for you so far, has it?

12:24.076 --> 12:25.703
No, it hasn't.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.330
Good, be smart, learn from your mistakes.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.542
But why should I follow you?
You wanna take me to Hell.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.795
Don't you need to go to Hell?

12:37.256 --> 12:40.676
That's a good point.
Johannes, can I call you JoJo?

12:41.260 --> 12:42.762
Hmm…

12:42.845 --> 12:43.721
Nope.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.515
-Please?
-Uh-uh.

12:47.057 --> 12:50.227
At the same time,
Gretel was in terrible danger.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.523
Mother, are you hiding something?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.066
No, son.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.360
-Just cooking.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.364
Oh, well, if you're not hiding anything,

13:02.448 --> 13:04.950
then you won't mind if I do… this!

13:06.994 --> 13:09.330
What are you doing?

13:09.413 --> 13:11.081
-Aha!

13:18.214 --> 13:20.132
-Oh, my!

13:20.716 --> 13:22.593
-Uh, whoops.
-Mumsy!

13:22.676 --> 13:25.596
Dearie me.
I'm such a butterfingers.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.473
-You ruined my potion!

13:27.556 --> 13:31.018
Now I'm gonna have to go back out
into the forest and get more wolfsbane!

13:41.237 --> 13:44.532
-Get out! Go! As fast as you can!

13:44.615 --> 13:47.409
You should be safe
if you run towards the village!

13:53.082 --> 13:54.375
What about you?!

13:54.458 --> 13:57.253
-The-- the shackles are enchanted.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.797
They can't be opened while he's alive.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.173
Forget me.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.801
-Just get to safety.

14:04.593 --> 14:05.511
Thank you.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.024
How can there be so many?

14:23.821 --> 14:25.823
I can't just leave you here.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.618
No, you can't free us!

14:29.702 --> 14:32.913
The cages won't open
as long as the warlock lives!

14:32.997 --> 14:34.498
-You must go!

14:34.582 --> 14:38.460
But please tell our families
what has happened!

14:38.544 --> 14:41.380
It's bad enough
to be a soul trapped forever,

14:41.463 --> 14:43.674
but to be forgotten is unbearable!

14:43.757 --> 14:45.885
Tell me your names.

14:45.968 --> 14:46.969
I'll remember.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.012
-Aurora!
-Deborah!

14:48.095 --> 14:49.096
-Sybil!
-Annabelle!

14:49.179 --> 14:50.180
-Clotilda!
-Phillipa!

14:50.264 --> 14:51.098
-Jane!
-Susanna!

14:51.181 --> 14:52.182
-Katherine!
-Guinevere!

14:52.266 --> 14:53.267
-Sarah!
-Edna!

14:53.350 --> 14:54.184
-Aurora!
-Audrey!

14:54.268 --> 14:55.227
-Go!
-Go!

14:55.311 --> 14:56.562
I will remember!

14:56.645 --> 14:57.855
-Go!

14:57.938 --> 15:01.400
-Annabelle, Deborah, Eva…

15:02.651 --> 15:06.864
Once upon a time, an old man
led a young boy to see the Devil.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.825
After much travel, they came to a village.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.203
Go away. Can't you read the sign?

15:16.665 --> 15:20.210
Please. I'm a little boy
on my way to meet the Devil in Hell.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.213
Every day
is Hell in this village.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.842
We have a magic fountain that used
to provide unlimited melted chocolate.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.219
Chocolate? Mmm.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.262
Everyone would come…

15:30.846 --> 15:32.181
-Whoa!

15:32.264 --> 15:35.559
…dip their fruit, marshmallows,
small pieces of cake.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.854
But now everything stinks
because it stopped working.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.898
-Devil knows why.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.316
Oh. He does?

15:42.399 --> 15:45.569
-Then I'll ask him.
-No, kid, it's an expression.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.614
Well, I'm gonna see him anyway.
It's really no trouble.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.658
So, is there any cake left?

15:50.741 --> 15:52.826
Yeah, gross, dry cake.

16:02.795 --> 16:08.008
The next day, they continued on,
and came to a gold foundry.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.135
-Go away!

16:10.219 --> 16:11.804
I have to report to Hell.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.932
Please give me a place to rest
before I'm damned for all eternity.

16:15.015 --> 16:19.937
Okay. But if you steal anything,
I'll chop your head off!

16:20.020 --> 16:20.938
Been there.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.690
I'm sorry I'm so suspicious.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.149
-Whoa.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.778
We have a beautiful apple tree
that used to give us an unlimited supply

16:27.861 --> 16:29.321
of golden apples.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.740
One day, it stopped bearing fruit.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.368
-The Devil knows why.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.078
I'll ask him when I see him.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.246
Thanks, kid.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.791
You seem really nice,
but maybe not so smart.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.627
I'm going there anyway.
It's really no trouble.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.972
The next day
was Hansel's last day on Earth.

16:56.098 --> 17:00.561
And on that day, he and Johannes
came upon a ferryman

17:01.353 --> 17:02.438
at a river.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.202
All aboard who's going to Hell.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.758
Oh, man. I hate my job.

17:30.841 --> 17:33.135
I hate my life.
I hate everything. I hate water.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.595
I hate this boat.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.846
I hate this paddle.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.599
You seem sad. Don't you like your job?

17:38.682 --> 17:39.850
It seems fun.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.810
Fun? Fun?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.813
I never get to leave this boat.
I'm stuck here.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.942
I don't sleep, there's nothing to eat
but raw fish, there's no coffee breaks,

17:49.026 --> 17:52.321
and don't even get me started
about going to the bathroom.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.740
I'm trapped. The Devil knows why.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.327
-I'll be meeting him soon, I'll ask him.
-Right.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.080
I'm sure you'll have nothing
better to talk about.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.596
Uh, Sybil, uh, Juliana,

18:17.679 --> 18:20.349
Jane, Clarice, Constance…

18:20.432 --> 18:22.392
-Uh… Oh, oh…

18:22.476 --> 18:24.394
Edna, uh, Sandra!

18:24.478 --> 18:27.898
I warned you.
But did you listen to me?

18:28.482 --> 18:29.650
No.

18:29.733 --> 18:34.029
That tree in the wood of life
was right, you are dumb.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.280
Shut up!

18:35.364 --> 18:36.907
No one likes smug weather!

18:36.990 --> 18:41.036
-I'm not smug, you're smug.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.540
Amanda, Charlotte,
Audrey, Felisha, Susanna!

18:50.045 --> 18:53.674
I must really be bad
if I wound up here.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.426
Even when I was trying
my hardest to be good.

18:56.510 --> 19:00.139
No, Hansel, even while
you were on your way to Hell,

19:00.222 --> 19:03.142
you were still trying to help people.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.645
Only a very good person would do that.

19:07.521 --> 19:11.358
I might as well be here.
I can never see my sister again.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.318
-Why not?
-I…

19:14.236 --> 19:16.029
I tried to kill her.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.990
She must be so mad at me.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.784
She didn't seem that mad when I saw her.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.619
You saw Gretel?

19:22.703 --> 19:23.912
Yes.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.289
She seemed sad.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.791
She was holding this toy.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.502
A dragon… A dragon, I think.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.172
That's my dragon! That's mine!

19:33.255 --> 19:36.133
If she kept it, that means she misses me!

19:36.216 --> 19:38.177
Maybe she forgives me!

19:38.260 --> 19:39.678
I could see her again!

19:40.596 --> 19:42.723
But… I have to be here.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.644
I have to go to Hell
when I could be with Gretel.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.729
There's still hope.

19:48.812 --> 19:52.065
I know a secret way to escape from Hell.

19:52.149 --> 19:55.652
Seems like something
you could've mentioned earlier.

19:55.736 --> 20:01.241
Hansel, if you can steal three golden
hairs from the Devil's head,

20:01.325 --> 20:06.163
he will have no power over you
and you might be able to get away.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.748
I can just run out?

20:07.831 --> 20:10.834
He can still stab you
with his pitchfork or whatever.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.878
You'll still have to get past the demons,

20:12.961 --> 20:16.506
but none of them will be
able to use their magic against you.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.009
You'll have a ghost of a chance.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.595
The very faintest.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.766
But won't plucking the Devil's hairs
make him mad?

20:25.849 --> 20:28.227
That sounds like
it would just make things worse!

20:28.310 --> 20:29.937
Why should I trust you?

20:32.105 --> 20:35.150
Because I was in Hell.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.569
-And while I was there,

20:37.653 --> 20:39.196
I learned a thing or two.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.573
And you got nothing else, kid.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.585
I'm sorry, I can't go with you.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.380
But I will wait for you right here.

20:58.882 --> 21:01.677
Welcome to Hell. My name is Asmodeus.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.554
So, you'll be taking me to see the Devil?

21:04.638 --> 21:07.307
No. I will be showing you around,

21:07.391 --> 21:09.810
then I will be boiling you alive.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.397
-Then the Devil?
-Get a move on, kiddo!

21:14.690 --> 21:17.609
On your left,
there are people being tortured.

21:17.693 --> 21:21.613
If you look a little past that,
you will see people being tortured.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.284
Up ahead, there are people being tortured.

21:26.410 --> 21:30.247
Now follow me, and I will show you
some people being tortured.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.666
It's always about the torment
with you, Asmodeus.

21:32.749 --> 21:35.168
Couldn't you point out
our newly remodeled break room?

21:36.545 --> 21:38.255
And work on your delivery, mate.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.924
How is he supposed
to be interested, if you're not?

21:41.591 --> 21:43.260
Ooh! Whoa!

21:44.720 --> 21:47.055
I, for one,
found his delivery fascinating.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.432
Please, continue.

21:48.515 --> 21:49.391
Thank you.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.476
Oh, suck up.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.479
On your left,
you will see people being tortured.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.900
Hey, more pee in the pool!

22:01.320 --> 22:03.572
-Hi, Mrs. Baker.
-Stop! Please, stop! Oh!

22:03.655 --> 22:06.158
Pretty please with a cherry on top?

22:06.742 --> 22:08.493
Let me think about that. Hmm.

22:09.745 --> 22:13.290
No! I think instead of stopping,
we'll have more torment!

22:13.373 --> 22:15.542
-No!

22:15.625 --> 22:17.044
-No!

22:17.127 --> 22:21.590
Oh, Hansel!
I'm so sorry for what I did! Oh!

22:21.673 --> 22:24.676
I know I deserve to be here!

22:25.177 --> 22:26.887
Yes, you do.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.890
Excuse me.

22:29.973 --> 22:32.142
-She did some terrible things,

22:32.225 --> 22:33.643
but she's sorry.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.063
Can't you let her go? Please?

22:36.730 --> 22:40.025
Let her go? What kind of Hell
would this be if we did that?

22:40.108 --> 22:43.111
Wait, aren't you the one who killed her?

22:43.904 --> 22:45.530
Well, I was there.

22:45.614 --> 22:49.326
It is written in The Great
and Terrible Book of Hell,

22:50.118 --> 22:51.787
no takesie backsies.

22:54.581 --> 22:55.415
Hansel!

22:55.499 --> 22:58.668
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said about stopping.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.003
And it gave me an idea.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.519
So, am I gonna see the Devil now?

23:15.602 --> 23:19.398
-No. You're way too low level.
-We're going to be torturing you.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.149
-Take that.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.567
-And that.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.652
Ha!

23:23.735 --> 23:25.404
-Take that.
-Ha!

23:25.487 --> 23:27.239
-Ha!
-Ha, ha!

23:27.322 --> 23:30.242
-Huh. You'd think torment would hurt.
-Ha!

23:30.325 --> 23:32.327
-Ha, ha, ha!
-And some more of that.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.000
-Ha!

23:39.668 --> 23:40.877
-Ha!

23:42.879 --> 23:44.756
Maybe you don't understand.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.049
We're torturing you.

23:46.591 --> 23:47.592
Oh, no, I get it.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.719
It's most painful and frightening.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.681
Yes, you're very good at it.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.310
Can't you at least scream?

23:58.061 --> 24:00.939
Ah…

24:01.523 --> 24:04.151
I get very uncomfortable
when they don't scream.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.570
Yeah. This has gone all kinds of wrong.

24:07.237 --> 24:10.157
Well, you might have
to take me to your boss.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.160
No, no, no.
We just gotta try something else.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.293
Phew.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.004
Ooph!

24:46.985 --> 24:50.071
I don't even feel
like a real demon anymore.

24:50.155 --> 24:53.241
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
you're still very frightening.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.826
Don't let him get to you.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.287
Look at what you did to him.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.205
He's a mess!

24:58.288 --> 25:00.874
I'm sorry. Should I try screaming again?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.044
Your screams are lies!

25:06.880 --> 25:08.465
Look, it's not you.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.467
-You guys are both great.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.177
I mean, terrible.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.847
It's just that I've suffered so much,
none of this seems so bad.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.349
No one's suffered that much.

25:17.432 --> 25:20.644
I have.
First my parents chopped off my head.

25:20.727 --> 25:23.271
Who would do such a thing?

25:23.355 --> 25:25.815
Then I was almost cooked
and eaten by Mrs. Baker.

25:25.899 --> 25:26.858
Nah. Really?

25:26.942 --> 25:29.528
Then I turned into a monster
and almost killed my sister,

25:29.611 --> 25:31.905
and my adopted father
gambled me away to the Devil.

25:31.988 --> 25:33.865
-Ooh, that's low!

25:33.949 --> 25:37.536
Okay, keep going, keep going.
These are great ideas.

25:37.619 --> 25:41.623
And I got killed by hunters, but I came
back when they cut me out of my own belly.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.125
I'm gonna be sick.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.919
And the worst thing of all is

25:46.628 --> 25:49.172
-I'll never see my sister again.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.884
Compared to all that,
what you're doing is nothing.

25:54.052 --> 25:58.056
I'm sorry I'm not being tortured right.
I really am trying, but…

25:59.891 --> 26:02.227
I guess I'll have to see your boss now.

26:03.603 --> 26:04.854
Yeah, he's right.

26:08.149 --> 26:09.859
We're gonna have to take him to…

26:10.610 --> 26:12.445
the Devil himself.

26:20.537 --> 26:23.665
Up ahead, you will see the Devil's house.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.959
It was built of human bones.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.712
The Devil harvested them all himself.

26:29.629 --> 26:32.549
Those bones are still alive, by the way.

26:32.632 --> 26:36.720
If you listen closely,
you can hear them screaming.

26:47.147 --> 26:50.150
I'm safe! I'm safe! I'm safe!

26:50.650 --> 26:51.943
Oh…

26:52.027 --> 26:56.031
Oh, Drago,
if he knew I was there he'd kill me.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.909
But it's okay, I can find Hansel now.

26:59.993 --> 27:04.331

27:04.414 --> 27:06.124
-No!

27:06.708 --> 27:10.045
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-No, no, no, no, no!

27:11.046 --> 27:12.213
No!

27:12.297 --> 27:13.840
-Well, Mother…

27:13.923 --> 27:15.634

27:23.433 --> 27:24.809
But on the plus side…

27:29.898 --> 27:31.024
Oh!
