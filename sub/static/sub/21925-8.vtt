00:49.507 --> 00:54.846
I was hoping to get a high-ranking Vulcan,

00:54.929 --> 00:57.891
but this is so much better.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.558
General Kol.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.773
The scar is an improvement, L'Rell.

10:07.982 --> 10:11.110
Earned in battle. I wear it with pride.

10:11.694 --> 10:15.406
Congratulations. House after house
has vowed their allegiance to you.

10:15.489 --> 10:21.996
Do not mistake me
for your fallen idol T'Kuvma.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.789
He sought unity.

10:24.332 --> 10:29.712
I seek only Klingon supremacy
under my rule.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.048
The dissemination
of the cloaking technology

10:32.131 --> 10:33.924
has earned you many loyalists.

10:34.467 --> 10:39.096
I wish to count myself,
my house, among them.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.432
Your loyalty isn't enough.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.602
What else can you offer me?

10:45.311 --> 10:47.938
My skills as an interrogator.

10:48.481 --> 10:53.569
My spies tell me you have a prisoner
who refuses to speak.

10:54.278 --> 10:59.325
Bring me some information
that will add to my glory,

10:59.408 --> 11:02.745
and I will consider your request.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.430
L'Rell, where are you taking the prisoner?

25:18.892 --> 25:21.228
She took my blade and tried to escape.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.563
I will dispose of the body.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.412
Grafk.

29:57.253 --> 29:58.338
Torath.

30:00.673 --> 30:01.674
Silrek.

30:05.261 --> 30:07.222
I will end Kol.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.059
I will avenge you all.

30:12.727 --> 30:15.730
I swear it to you.

36:07.874 --> 36:11.502
Before her escape,
the human confirmed that  Discovery

36:11.586 --> 36:13.337
possesses a powerful technology.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.883
Were it replicated,
your conquest could reach far beyond

36:16.966 --> 36:19.343
the limits of our empire.

36:19.802 --> 36:22.430
I had hoped for more. You were reckless.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.933
-I was effective.
-She got away from you.

36:26.434 --> 36:29.270
Not for long.

36:29.353 --> 36:33.357
General Kol, if you don't see my value,

36:33.441 --> 36:35.651
I will take my leave now.

36:39.071 --> 36:39.906
Stop!

36:42.033 --> 36:42.867
L'Rell.

37:02.345 --> 37:05.389
There will be more prisoners...

37:06.557 --> 37:09.810
before this war finds its end.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.772
A skilled interrogator will be crucial...

37:16.150 --> 37:21.614
as long as you vow allegiance

37:22.281 --> 37:25.159
to House Kor.

37:32.458 --> 37:36.420
My Lord, I would be honored to serve you.

37:39.423 --> 37:44.095
Did you think
I would not see through your deceit?

37:44.553 --> 37:49.433
Show her how House Kor treats liars.

37:52.561 --> 37:53.688
My Lord!

37:53.771 --> 37:56.148
We have intercepted a massive signal.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.943
From a planet called Pahvo.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.945
A message?

38:02.863 --> 38:04.073
An invitation.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.661
Set a course for Pahvo.
