WEBVTT

00:02.180 --> 00:03.300
he was hitting on me.

00:03.310 --> 00:04.800
You are so full of yourself.

00:04.810 --> 00:08.070
Chad barry has had,like,ten
girlfriends in the last year.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.510
They say when you are a drug addict,

00:09.520 --> 00:12.280
you're supposed to think of
something that you want to live for.

00:12.290 --> 00:14.370
The thing I live for is.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.420
is my family.

00:15.430 --> 00:17.090
My staff made assumptions about us.

00:17.106 --> 00:18.600
So you hijacked my date.

00:18.612 --> 00:19.749
I thought you'd find it charming.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.160
I can't date you.

00:21.174 --> 00:22.088
I know.

00:22.099 --> 00:23.491
So you are gay.

00:23.508 --> 00:25.022
No,man.

00:25.325 --> 00:27.830
But it doesn't mean I don't think you're hot.

00:29.867 --> 00:31.141
We were having fun.That's all

00:31.156 --> 00:33.562
well, I want us to have fun, and we don't.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.063
Not like we used to.

00:35.237 --> 00:37.000
Are you dating kitty walker?

00:37.017 --> 00:39.173
How long have you two been seeing each other?

00:41.555 --> 00:43.702
It's a picture frame.

00:43.718 --> 00:44.952
It's so.

00:44.965 --> 00:47.190
shiny and pretty.

00:47.207 --> 00:49.191
It's just what I wanted for my birthday.

00:49.208 --> 00:50.330
She hates it.

00:50.348 --> 00:51.763
Well, we just thought with the baby coming...

00:51.776 --> 00:54.200
No, no, no. You can never
have enough picture frames.

00:54.217 --> 00:55.873
I love it.Thank you so much.

00:55.887 --> 00:58.293
Sarah, this cake is so delicious.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.762
I know, and it's store-bought.

01:00.775 --> 01:02.823
Mom, I-I really wanted to bake, but,

01:02.835 --> 01:04.680
you know, it's been really busy at work,

01:04.694 --> 01:07.713
and Cooper's had this horrible flu
literally projectile vomiting.

01:08.535 --> 01:09.373
Eating. Eating.

01:09.387 --> 01:10.843
Sorry, guys.

01:10.858 --> 01:12.723
Sarah, you don't have to make excuses.

01:12.735 --> 01:15.321
I love store-bought white coconut cake.

01:15.336 --> 01:16.901
It's my favorite. And besides that,

01:16.915 --> 01:19.333
you know I didn't want a big birthday party.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.402
No, I-I don't need anythingancy.

01:21.418 --> 01:22.122
I know,I know.

01:22.138 --> 01:23.850
Oh, my dear sister, you are many things,

01:23.866 --> 01:25.730
bulow maintenance certainly ain't one of them.

01:25.747 --> 01:27.053
Oh, Sauly, come on.

01:27.068 --> 01:31.430
Now you know I was the one that insisted we do
something low-key and intimate and quiet.

01:31.448 --> 01:32.842
This is perfect.

01:32.856 --> 01:35.411
Oh, mother. You wanted a party.

01:35.426 --> 01:37.242
No, I didn't. I don't!

01:37.256 --> 01:39.140
- I told you. Didn't I tell you?
- Yeah

01:39.156 --> 01:42.650
You know, in our defense, mom,
you were really quite convincing.

01:42.665 --> 01:45.611
Kev, you don't have to apologize
for listening to me.

01:45.626 --> 01:46.971
This isn't a-a wedding.

01:46.985 --> 01:48.293
It's not a bar mitzvah.

01:48.305 --> 01:49.600
It's just aging.

01:49.618 --> 01:52.140
I'm 60.

01:55.718 --> 01:56.822
More cake?

01:56.835 --> 01:59.300
I can't believe she thought that was her party.

01:59.317 --> 02:01.593
I know. I almost felt sorry for her.

02:03.226 --> 02:07.892
Did you see that look of devastation
when we brought her the cake from Aisle Six?

02:08.978 --> 02:11.042
oh, my god, it was total genius.

02:11.058 --> 02:13.850
Okay, come on. Let's not pat
ourselves on the back quite yet.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.753
We still have a surprise party to pull off.

02:15.767 --> 02:16.962
Okay. 1:00 P.M.

02:16.978 --> 02:20.481
Kitty leaves the house with mom
to take her to the matinee of "wicked"

02:20.496 --> 02:21.492
Really? Not Kevin?

02:21.505 --> 02:24.061
Didn't you use to date one
of those flying monkeys?

02:24.388 --> 02:27.340
Don't laugh.One of those flying
monkeys got them house seats.

02:27.358 --> 02:29.550
Excuse me. Who are you
texting so frantically?

02:29.565 --> 02:31.401
Nothing frantic about it.
I have fast thumbs.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.101
Great. I'll put them to
use in the kitchen.

02:33.117 --> 02:34.333
I need you here by 9:00.

02:34.348 --> 02:35.670
What...whoa,9:00?

02:35.687 --> 02:37.372
Aren't I supposed to meet,

02:37.386 --> 02:39.681
uh, Sparky's party
people at mom's house?

02:39.696 --> 02:41.090
Uh-huh, in the afternoon.

02:41.105 --> 02:42.960
Well, that's the whole day.

02:42.978 --> 02:44.082
Come on, I have work to do.

02:44.098 --> 02:46.402
How...look...how come Kitty
got out of this?

02:46.485 --> 02:48.633
That would be a dead giveaway
if she left with us.

02:48.648 --> 02:49.291
She lives there.

02:49.305 --> 02:50.373
- Oh,yeah.
- Exactly.

02:50.386 --> 02:52.670
Now, Saul, how are we doing
with the R.S.V.P.S?

02:52.688 --> 02:55.211
41. Our usual closest
friends and relatives.

02:55.227 --> 02:57.530
Good. Tommy, do we have
enough liquor for 40-plus?

02:57.545 --> 02:58.591
Yeah,we're swimming in the stuff.

02:58.608 --> 03:02.190
That vineyard Holly wants to buy, they're
just sending over crates of wine.

03:02.207 --> 03:02.851
Great.

03:03.216 --> 03:04.852
Okay, 2:00 P.M. Julia.

03:04.866 --> 03:06.340
I know,I pick up the cake at Millie's.

03:06.356 --> 03:08.930
Yeah, and I'm off to malibu
to get justin from rehab.

03:08.947 --> 03:12.053
Report back to base
camp at 1700 hours, sir!

03:12.065 --> 03:13.751
- Great.
- I gotta go.

03:13.765 --> 03:14.481
Wait, wait, wait.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.881
- Did we all leave ourvideo testimonials?
- Yes, I did it.

03:16.896 --> 03:19.881
Mine's on that chair in the dining room.

03:21.655 --> 03:23.083
Drive safe.

03:23.447 --> 03:27.021
okay, Rachel Ray, time for bed.

03:27.036 --> 03:28.103
No,no,no.

03:28.115 --> 03:30.860
You can't get out of this.
We have a video to make.

03:33.215 --> 03:34.763
You don't have to go, you know.

03:34.776 --> 03:37.000
I have a whole pint of
ice cream in the fridge.

03:37.018 --> 03:39.180
I guess you don't eat ice cream, right?

03:39.197 --> 03:40.833
More of a sorbet man?

03:41.257 --> 03:43.570
I just gotta get a good
night's sleep, that's all.

03:43.588 --> 03:45.383
I have a big scene tomorrow.

03:45.397 --> 03:49.451
My father's old mafia boss is trying
to kill me with a poisoned latte.

03:49.518 --> 03:51.463
- I hope you live.
- I do.

03:51.478 --> 03:53.280
My girlfriend Krista drinks it instead.

03:53.296 --> 03:56.131
Oh,she's the...she's the nurse
with the huge breasts, right?

03:56.265 --> 03:58.821
I thought you never watch the show, Mr Snob.

03:58.835 --> 04:00.391
I just started tivoing it.

04:00.405 --> 04:01.651
You did?

04:03.507 --> 04:04.500
So what do you think?

04:04.516 --> 04:05.792
I think you're great.

04:05.807 --> 04:08.322
My sister Sarah's been filling
me in on who's who.

04:08.677 --> 04:10.581
She used to watch it all the
time when she was pregnant.

04:10.597 --> 04:12.701
She can't get over the
fact we're hanging out.

04:12.946 --> 04:14.850
You told your sister about us?

04:14.867 --> 04:17.560
Just...yeah,just that we're
friend it's...it's fine.

04:17.575 --> 04:19.361
Don't worry. It's fine.

04:19.987 --> 04:22.650
It's just, we gotta be careful, dude.

04:22.666 --> 04:25.112
This is career suicide for me.

04:25.485 --> 04:27.251
- You understand, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

04:27.268 --> 04:30.412
You know, you're a tv heartthrob
with a girlfriend. Come on.

04:30.427 --> 04:32.341
It'd be stupid for me to think that this is,

04:32.357 --> 04:34.410
you know, anything more
than what it is. It's fine.

04:35.127 --> 04:36.710
Don't be like that.

04:37.495 --> 04:41.300
Look, I've been with other guys 
before, but never more than once.

04:42.787 --> 04:44.710
This is a big deal for me.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:54.347 --> 04:56.563
You should get a good night's rest.

04:56.697 --> 05:00.070
I wouldn't want you to accidentally
drink the poisoned latte.

05:01.298 --> 05:02.991
Cool.

05:05.857 --> 05:06.722
I'll text you good night?

05:06.736 --> 05:09.312
Nothing says good night like a text.

05:10.465 --> 05:12.193
Hey, mom.

05:12.206 --> 05:14.083
Uh, happy birthday.

05:14.506 --> 05:17.400
You taught me to be a
friend and a mother.

05:17.948 --> 05:20.832
I'm definitely my mother's daughter...
the good,the bad and the ugly.

05:21.148 --> 05:23.310
Not that there's anything ugly.

05:23.547 --> 05:24.902
Oh, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

05:24.916 --> 05:25.892
What? That was okay.That was good.

05:26.008 --> 05:28.320
Stop. I gotta...I gotta do it again.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.519
Go again.Just give me a second.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.130
Happy birthday, mom.

05:32.144 --> 05:34.518
Ah,keep prac...keep practicing.Just a sec.

05:34.529 --> 05:36.503
60 years old. 60 years young.

05:37.057 --> 05:38.711
Quiet on the set, please.

05:38.728 --> 05:42.300
Sarah's toast to her mom, take 16.

05:42.318 --> 05:43.342
It's not fair.

05:43.358 --> 05:45.141
Kitty has such an advantage.

05:45.156 --> 05:46.193
She had her own tv show.

05:46.207 --> 05:48.492
Yeah. Um, you can do it.

05:48.507 --> 05:49.560
- Come on.
- Okay.

05:49.575 --> 05:52.473
Make love to the camera, baby.

05:52.485 --> 05:53.851
Oh,stop it. Cut it out.

05:53.866 --> 05:55.610
Oh,yeah.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.041
What are you doing?

05:57.055 --> 05:58.033
That's what I'm talkin' about.

05:58.045 --> 06:00.350
What? Joe!

06:00.845 --> 06:02.231
Come on!

06:02.345 --> 06:03.911
We're not.

06:03.925 --> 06:06.880
making a sex video.

06:06.897 --> 06:08.912
Oh, hey. There's an idea.

06:08.926 --> 06:10.202
Yeah.You're insane.

06:10.216 --> 06:13.110
You know, you said that you
wanted to have more fun.

06:13.348 --> 06:14.273
This would be fun.

06:14.285 --> 06:16.032
Yeah. Yeah,right.

06:16.048 --> 06:21.280
We do it right here on the couch with the kids upstairs
and Cooper about to wake up at any moment to puke.

06:21.297 --> 06:24.182
That is so hot.

06:26.976 --> 06:28.492
You're serious.

06:28.557 --> 06:30.241
Joe! Come on.

06:30.256 --> 06:33.683
This is the same tape as my
mother's 60th video tribute.

06:33.696 --> 06:35.270
I put in a new tape.

06:35.285 --> 06:36.531
You did?

06:42.258 --> 06:43.962
if this ends up on the internet--

06:43.977 --> 06:45.691
we'll make a million.

06:50.706 --> 06:54.732
No, no, Betty, it was exactly what I wanted.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.991
You remember Renee Baumann's 60th?

06:57.006 --> 06:58.321
It was a total debacle.

06:58.338 --> 07:01.033
Half the neighborhood ended
up with food poisoning.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.371
I...Betty, there's someone at the door.

07:03.385 --> 07:04.562
I have to go.

07:04.575 --> 07:06.611
I'll call you right back. Bye-bye.

07:09.607 --> 07:11.060
Mom.

07:11.078 --> 07:12.633
Oh, my god, mom!

07:12.648 --> 07:15.030
Well, Nora, please get out of the doorway.

07:15.048 --> 07:16.911
It's cold out there.

07:17.668 --> 07:19.591
Mother, what are you doing here?

07:19.608 --> 07:20.562
Well, it's your birthday, Honey.

07:20.575 --> 07:24.207
What do you think I'm doing here? 
Actually, my birthday was two days ago.

07:24.207 --> 07:25.490
You're a little late.

07:25.507 --> 07:28.620
Late? The party is not till tonight.

07:29.186 --> 07:30.342
What party?

07:30.355 --> 07:33.791
Well, your birthday party, obviously.

07:34.395 --> 07:38.122
I have the feeling it was supposed
to be a surprise, mother.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.201
A surprise party.

07:42.297 --> 07:45.143
- I see.
- It's okay. That's okay, mother.

07:45.158 --> 07:46.351
Maybe you didn't know.

07:46.367 --> 07:49.241
These things can happen, I guess.

07:49.517 --> 07:52.002
So it's my fault now?

07:53.597 --> 07:55.042
Would you get my bag?

07:55.057 --> 07:58.290
The cab driver left it out at the curb.

07:59.106 --> 08:01.693
Oh, my god.

08:06.378 --> 08:08.473
Brothers And Sisters 113
"Something Ida This Way Comes"

08:09.447 --> 08:12.001
Right. One second. One second.

08:13.146 --> 08:15.241
I told you I did not want a big to-do!

08:15.258 --> 08:17.410
Are you crazy, Nora? It's your 60th birthday.

08:17.425 --> 08:19.470
Did you think we really were
gonna stop at coconut cake?

08:19.487 --> 08:22.660
I certainly didn't think you would
invite our mother to a surprise party

08:22.676 --> 08:24.970
which I was very clear about
not wanting in the first place!

08:24.986 --> 08:26.330
Not that clear.

08:26.347 --> 08:29.402
I mean, she calls me every sunday
night.What am I supposed to do?

08:29.418 --> 08:31.643
I mean, if I thought that
she was actually gonna come...

08:31.657 --> 08:33.501
Well, of course she would come!

08:33.515 --> 08:35.081
You invited her!

08:35.097 --> 08:37.030
I did not invite her!

08:38.027 --> 08:39.351
She's here because she loves you.

08:39.366 --> 08:41.701
No, don't...don't...

08:41.717 --> 08:44.632
She never even came to
my husband's funeral!

08:44.645 --> 08:45.883
What kind of mother is that?

08:45.897 --> 08:47.890
- Just calm down.
- I'm calm.

08:48.248 --> 08:50.143
- All right, let's go.
- All right, fine.

08:51.987 --> 08:54.053
Hi,mom. I'll make you some coffee.

08:55.406 --> 08:57.702
You have so many fancy gadgets here.

08:57.715 --> 08:59.662
Do you even use half this stuff?

08:59.677 --> 09:01.123
I like to cook, mom.

09:01.138 --> 09:04.352
it's not cooking when you use all this stuff.

09:04.478 --> 09:05.952
It's cheating.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.110
Yeah.

09:14.165 --> 09:17.030
Here she comes, people, our fearless leader.

09:17.046 --> 09:19.732
Your kitchen awaits.

09:21.275 --> 09:22.341
Hon, you okay?

09:22.355 --> 09:24.820
Yeah, I just--um, my tummy's a little off.

09:25.418 --> 09:27.283
No,don't. Don't "uh-oh" me.

09:27.298 --> 09:28.681
I'm not gonna get sick.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.091
You look green.

09:30.106 --> 09:32.933
like Kermit the frog, green.

09:32.948 --> 09:35.460
I am cooking for 40-plus.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.261
I do not have time to get sick.

09:37.275 --> 09:38.991
Okay.

09:39.835 --> 09:42.682
- Where do you want the...the
- oh, god.

09:44.207 --> 09:45.692
Lamb?

09:46.778 --> 09:49.231
What? No. No, no. You're kidding
me. You can't be sick.

09:49.245 --> 09:51.572
I already told myself
that, kevin. It didn't work.

09:51.588 --> 09:54.472
Look, the party's in 9
hours and 33 minutes.

09:54.488 --> 09:56.363
I am really sorry, guys.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.170
Oh, Sarah, this is so not your fault.

09:58.188 --> 09:59.803
Yes, it is her fault! I told her to...

09:59.818 --> 10:01.283
I told you to get a flu shot!

10:01.298 --> 10:02.510
How is this helping?

10:02.528 --> 10:03.492
It's not.

10:03.508 --> 10:04.921
Well, look, I can't cook for everybody.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.112
Well, clearly, we do have to find a caterer.

10:08.126 --> 10:09.302
For tonight?

10:09.315 --> 10:11.260
Okay, guys, just calm down.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.491
Where the hell is Kitty?

10:12.508 --> 10:14.520
What--she's not doing anything for this party.

10:14.537 --> 10:17.313
Kitty is already making calls from her office.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.033
The bulk of the planning is already done.

10:19.046 --> 10:24.201
I just...I need you guys to just...
to step up and take the reins,

10:24.228 --> 10:25.822
okay, and communicate with each other.

10:25.835 --> 10:28.813
Now can I trust that you can handle this, guys?

10:28.826 --> 10:30.150
- Yes.
- yeah

10:30.165 --> 10:33.290
Good,because I'm gonna go and throw up now.

10:34.956 --> 10:36.792
You're strictly kosher?

10:37.356 --> 10:40.910
Well...well,just...just say that I
wanted to get , like, a cream sauce on--

10:40.925 --> 10:42.733
well, okay.

10:42.746 --> 10:43.922
Okay, okay.

10:43.938 --> 10:45.912
I--it--it.

10:46.988 --> 10:48.111
Good shabbas?

10:48.407 --> 10:51.322
Don't ask. It's my mother's
60th birthday party tonight.

10:51.337 --> 10:52.870
Ah,the big 6-0.

10:52.887 --> 10:56.433
Yeah, and, uh, we are suddenly without food.

10:56.838 --> 11:01.332
So the big 6-0 is about to become a big fast
unless I can find a caterer, and I can't.

11:01.347 --> 11:02.810
Use mine.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.880
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, I have a small catering staff at the ranch.

11:05.895 --> 11:06.932
Of course you do.

11:06.948 --> 11:08.521
Pietro is world-class.

11:08.538 --> 11:10.882
His crab cakes are unbelievable.

11:10.897 --> 11:12.371
Not kosher, but.

11:12.387 --> 11:14.033
Pietro, it's Robert.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.741
Listen,I have a little
bit an emergency.

11:15.757 --> 11:16.732
There's an event in L.A.

11:16.746 --> 11:18.270
Tonight, and I need you.

11:18.287 --> 11:20.121
Okay. I'll call you back with the info.

11:20.536 --> 11:21.940
Crisis averted.

11:21.956 --> 11:23.003
Uh, thank you.

11:23.018 --> 11:24.090
- It's nothing.
- No.

11:24.107 --> 11:24.943
No, it's not nothing.

11:24.955 --> 11:26.263
You just saved me--
well,saved--

11:26.278 --> 11:29.810
you saved all of us from giving my
mother a second horrible birthday party.

11:29.828 --> 11:31.052
And,you know, um

11:32.706 --> 11:34.152
you should come.

11:34.627 --> 11:35.403
Thank you.

11:35.417 --> 11:37.491
No, no. I'm--I'm serious.

11:37.878 --> 11:42.242
You can come and eat crab
cakes and...and "cake" cake and,

11:42.257 --> 11:43.910
you know, you'd meet the whole
entire crazy family.

11:43.926 --> 11:47.571
Well, not that it's gonna be one of those
small, intimate family dinner parties.

11:47.588 --> 11:51.130
My mother is actually shockingly popular,

11:51.146 --> 11:55.353
but, you know, there'll be lots of
people, and, well, mostly democrats.

11:55.776 --> 11:57.620
That's okay, you'll blend in,

11:57.637 --> 12:00.252
you know, unless, of
course, you have plans already.

12:00.538 --> 12:03.232
Just fraternizing with the enemy.

12:04.487 --> 12:05.933
Well, good.

12:07.245 --> 12:08.652
So you know how this is gonna work, right?

12:08.665 --> 12:12.202
Yeah, I'm his, uh, his chaperone, kind of.

12:12.218 --> 12:13.303
Not "kind of" Tommy.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.533
We're releasing
justin under your supervision.

12:15.547 --> 12:17.783
It's really important that
you're with him at all times.

12:17.798 --> 12:20.752
Is there any chance of me getting
an anklet like Martha Stewart?

12:21.248 --> 12:22.530
Just kidding.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.263
We need you to sign these papers.

12:24.276 --> 12:25.862
It's mostly for the insurance company.

12:25.875 --> 12:29.413
It sys that you're gonna be assuming all
liabilities for the time he's not under our roof.

12:29.426 --> 12:30.110
Sure.

12:30.128 --> 12:34.830
Also that you will not be taking Justin anyplace
where drugs or alcohol will be readily available.

12:36.358 --> 12:37.612
Is that a problem?

12:38.048 --> 12:38.990
Uh, no, no, no.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.453
Not a problem.

12:41.468 --> 12:43.621
Just--uh,just bring it all in
and set it down anywhere.

12:43.636 --> 12:45.780
That'd be great. Thank you very much.

12:45.887 --> 12:47.111
What are-- what are those?

12:47.125 --> 12:48.132
Oh, these goblets?

12:48.146 --> 12:49.840
Aren't they fabulous?

12:49.856 --> 12:51.072
What.

12:51.477 --> 12:52.142
What's..what's going.

12:52.155 --> 12:53.173
Who's in charge here?

12:53.188 --> 12:54.650
Uh, Sparky's in the dining room.

12:54.668 --> 12:56.372
What--excuse me!

12:57.185 --> 12:58.993
Um, are--are you Sparky?

12:59.005 --> 13:00.080
Doesn't this look great?

13:00.098 --> 13:02.400
It's your family's personalized coat of arms.

13:02.416 --> 13:03.263
Okay,stop.

13:03.275 --> 13:04.911
What--I'm sorry. What are you talking ab--

13:04.928 --> 13:07.632
what's with the gob-- why does it look
like the set of "camelot" in here?

13:07.647 --> 13:09.030
It's the medieval package.

13:09.047 --> 13:09.731
It's not what you ordered?

13:09.745 --> 13:12.231
No, no, no. We ordered the mid-level package.

13:12.247 --> 13:13.511
There's no such thing.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.211
You must have checked the wrong box.

13:15.226 --> 13:16.031
It says in the contract--

13:16.048 --> 13:18.050
Okay, okay. It's my mother's 60th, okay?

13:18.066 --> 13:21.482
Throwing her a party with a middle-aged theme
would be a little on the nose, don't you think?

13:21.927 --> 13:22.971
uh, sir, the wine?

13:22.987 --> 13:24.392
Yeah, yeah, 30 seconds.

13:24.407 --> 13:26.492
- Hello?
- I'm just double-checking.

13:26.508 --> 13:30.113
Are you sure you want to include
all this footage on your mom's tape?

13:30.265 --> 13:32.163
What--uh,uh,yes.Why?

13:32.178 --> 13:34.273
Uh, well, this one tape, it's a little

13:34.286 --> 13:36.433
uh, hold on a second. I have another call.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.173
Tommy, where are you?

13:38.205 --> 13:39.143
You're not gonna believe this.

13:39.156 --> 13:40.951
We can't have alcohol at the house.

13:40.966 --> 13:41.512
What?

13:41.525 --> 13:43.763
It's the only way they'll
allow Justin to be there.

13:43.775 --> 13:45.741
Okay.It's now officially a nightmare.

13:45.755 --> 13:47.283
Hey, it's not my rule.

13:47.298 --> 13:48.911
Don't get defensive. Just get here.

13:49.057 --> 13:49.611
You were saying?

13:49.626 --> 13:50.792
What I'm trying to tell you is,

13:50.806 --> 13:52.670
- one of these tapes is too racy
- sir, I'm on a schedule.

13:52.686 --> 13:53.983
Ok, that's great. You can just
put it back on the truck.

13:53.998 --> 13:56.282
Guys! You can just put it back on the truck.

13:56.298 --> 13:58.291
- Excuse me, Mr.Walker, this is too racy
- My job is to deliver, not take away.

13:58.307 --> 14:00.812
Okay, fine. Deliver it upstairs.Anything.

14:00.848 --> 14:02.460
Upstairs is extra.

14:02.478 --> 14:03.992
Whatever you have,just put it on there.

14:04.005 --> 14:06.313
I don't have time for this now,
okay? Thank you, bye.

14:08.488 --> 14:10.711
- Mr.Walker?
- Yeah?

14:10.728 --> 14:12.932
We're senator McCallister's security detail.

14:12.947 --> 14:14.772
Right,and--and you're here because?

14:14.786 --> 14:17.300
the senator will be attending
a party here this evening.

14:17.318 --> 14:18.472
Says who?

14:18.487 --> 14:19.992
His schedule.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.921
Did my sister invite him?

14:21.935 --> 14:23.313
We don't deal with his personal life.

14:23.325 --> 14:24.693
We're just here to sweep the house.

14:24.708 --> 14:25.452
Right.

14:25.468 --> 14:26.710
You won't even notice we're here.

14:26.726 --> 14:28.272
I doubt that.

14:32.646 --> 14:34.770
I love going to a matinee.

14:34.788 --> 14:35.982
I really, really loved it.

14:35.998 --> 14:40.130
I tell you what,I don't know why
kevin ended things with that flying monkey.

14:40.148 --> 14:41.470
He was just adorable.

14:41.485 --> 14:42.393
What are you doing?

14:42.406 --> 14:43.612
My lips are dry.

14:44.695 --> 14:46.541
This weather is so weird.

14:47.125 --> 14:49.021
All right. Shall we go?

14:49.038 --> 14:50.420
No, I'll get the door.

14:50.436 --> 14:51.891
Okay.

14:58.206 --> 15:01.562
So what are we gonna-- surprise!

15:06.387 --> 15:07.513
Oh, my goodness!

15:07.528 --> 15:10.473
Oh, my. Well,I--I'm just.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.342
Is that a coat of arms?

15:13.358 --> 15:14.881
Well, yeah, yeah.

15:14.896 --> 15:16.473
You...well, we know how you like them.

15:16.486 --> 15:17.911
Oh,yes. It's

15:17.928 --> 15:19.491
pretty.

15:24.178 --> 15:27.382
I-I can't believe what you pulled off, truly.

15:27.396 --> 15:30.112
Ah, well, Sarah deserves most of the credit.

15:30.127 --> 15:31.380
What did I do all day?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.682
Sarah got the flu from the kids.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.382
She's hoping to make it for cake.

15:35.037 --> 15:36.272
And, Justin!

15:36.288 --> 15:39.702
Oh, Justin, having you here is the
biggest gift of them all.

15:39.716 --> 15:41.360
Happy birthday, mom. You look great.

15:41.377 --> 15:44.672
Nora, a peasant girl told
me there is no alcohol.

15:44.686 --> 15:46.370
What is going on here?

15:46.385 --> 15:49.642
I'll--I'll get you a sparkling
cranberry juice, grandma.

15:51.475 --> 15:54.851
Well, who's the movie star?

15:57.136 --> 15:59.250
Senator McCallister, you came. Great.

15:59.267 --> 16:00.223
Hi.
- I Told you.

16:00.238 --> 16:01.931
So much for just fitting in.

16:01.947 --> 16:03.460
Oh, yeah.

16:03.475 --> 16:05.801
Is this a costume party?

16:05.817 --> 16:07.271
Apparently it is.

16:07.285 --> 16:10.693
But, you know, our house doesn't usually,

16:10.706 --> 16:11.933
you know, look like this.

16:11.946 --> 16:14.331
Nora, very happy birthday.

16:14.346 --> 16:16.242
I am so sorry to just be getting here,

16:16.257 --> 16:18.231
but you know the rule-- be early or late.

16:18.247 --> 16:20.482
Anything in the middle risks ruining the surprise.

16:20.935 --> 16:23.062
- Well, it wouldn't have mattered anyway,
- because I already-- mother.

16:23.076 --> 16:24.912
Yeah, well, you know,

16:24.926 --> 16:27.251
Senator McCallister, when sarah got sick,

16:27.265 --> 16:29.443
he-- he generously gave us his chef.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.883
Just an act of culinary bipartisanship.

16:31.895 --> 16:34.032
Well, thank god for you.

16:34.048 --> 16:36.660
or there'd be nothing to eat either.

16:36.677 --> 16:39.203
Uh, Kevin, do you think maybe
you could show grandma the couch?

16:39.215 --> 16:41.253
Sure. Like I haven't done enough today.

16:41.265 --> 16:42.623
Come on, grandma.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.131
Look at you.

16:48.145 --> 16:50.361
You are so handsome.

16:50.987 --> 16:52.843
Why are you still a bachelor?

16:52.858 --> 16:54.082
How is your love life?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.422
Are you dating anybody?

16:55.438 --> 16:56.701
Uh, I d--I don't--no. It's-- see,

16:56.717 --> 16:59.412
you just haven't met the
right girl yet, that's all.

16:59.428 --> 17:01.100
It's gonna happen.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.143
That's--grandma, the thing is, I'm--

17:04.157 --> 17:06.291
oh, look at you blushing.

17:06.306 --> 17:09.630
If I was your age, I would date you.

17:09.645 --> 17:11.330
You know what? I'm gonna get us some wine.

17:11.345 --> 17:13.282
Just, uh, just keep it on the D.L.

17:14.277 --> 17:16.391
Yeah. Keep it on the D.L.

17:16.896 --> 17:19.532
- A spinach custard.
- Kind of a custard? Kind of.

17:20.305 --> 17:23.141
A-- You, come with me now.

17:23.295 --> 17:24.741
Excuse me.

17:28.185 --> 17:29.522
Here I come.

17:30.668 --> 17:32.120
Where did they hide the booze?

17:32.135 --> 17:33.891
Tell me. Really, I'm not joking.

17:33.908 --> 17:35.911
Nora, if I knew where it was, I'd be drunk by now.

17:35.926 --> 17:37.711
Mom is driving me crazy.

17:37.727 --> 17:40.792
I'm gonna end up institutionalized
on my 60th birthday.

17:40.807 --> 17:42.071
Why do you let her get to you?

17:42.087 --> 17:43.232
Why don't you just walk away?

17:43.247 --> 17:45.761
Oh,where would I go? She's like
a heat-seeking missile.

17:45.777 --> 17:48.481
What am I gonna do with the two of you?
You're both behaving like children.

17:48.497 --> 17:50.282
How? How am I behaving like a child?

17:50.295 --> 17:53.071
You both blame each other for
the same thing, Nora.

17:53.276 --> 17:55.272
- What has she been telling you?
- Nothing.

17:55.286 --> 17:57.850
There's just so much misunderstanding
going on here.

17:57.867 --> 18:00.013
Oh, no, I understand everything she says.

18:00.025 --> 18:01.471
I wish I didn't.

18:01.485 --> 18:02.511
All right, tell me something.

18:02.527 --> 18:04.490
Did you tell her not to
come to William's funeral?

18:04.507 --> 18:06.341
She told me that you didn't want her there.

18:06.356 --> 18:08.183
I can't believe you listen to her.

18:08.647 --> 18:12.583
She asked me if it would be all right
if she went on a cruise to the bahamas.

18:12.596 --> 18:17.052
What was I supposed to say "no, mother, I really think
it's a better idea if you come to my husband's funeral"?

18:17.065 --> 18:20.021
Well, maybe she just wanted you to
tell her that you wanted her to come.

18:20.037 --> 18:22.383
You know what? It was not about her.

18:22.395 --> 18:23.963
My husband died.

18:23.976 --> 18:27.420
It was not my responsibility
to make her feel better.

18:28.295 --> 18:29.843
Why do you always take her side?

18:29.856 --> 18:31.860
I don't take anyone's side.

18:38.146 --> 18:39.351
All right.

18:42.475 --> 18:44.233
Oh, senator, hello.

18:44.268 --> 18:47.210
Excuse me. I just want to
see how everyone's doing.

18:50.608 --> 18:54.371
No, um, don't I know you? I feel like I.

18:54.388 --> 18:57.942
Yes. I cooked at a benefit
for the children's wish.

18:58.195 --> 19:00.423
Oh, that's right!

19:01.518 --> 19:03.742
Ah, that was my husband's favorite charity.

19:03.758 --> 19:04.890
It's being threatened, you know.

19:04.905 --> 19:06.143
A consortium of businessmen--

19:06.157 --> 19:10.973
they've, uh, figured out a way to manipulate eminent
domain to knock down the church and build a supermarket.

19:10.985 --> 19:12.443
It's appalling.

19:12.457 --> 19:15.093
I didn't think you republicans
cared about things like that.

19:15.107 --> 19:17.383
You know, Nora, I bet you and I
could find a lot to agree on.

19:17.397 --> 19:21.832
In fact, I'm sure you're in complete
agreement on what an astonishing woman kitty is.

19:23.227 --> 19:24.553
Ah, you know, you should relax.

19:24.565 --> 19:26.330
You're never gonna get her vote.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.623
Oh, I don't know. I-I think he's
my favorite republican,

19:29.637 --> 19:30.701
right behind Abe Lincoln.

19:30.716 --> 19:32.181
Any more ravioli left?

19:32.198 --> 19:34.010
The senator's thugs.

19:34.026 --> 19:36.570
Kevin, have you met senator mccallister?

19:36.586 --> 19:39.222
Uh, no, not officially, although
I am familiar with his politics.

19:39.238 --> 19:40.822
Hi, I'm kevin, the gay brother.

19:40.838 --> 19:41.342
How you doing?

19:41.357 --> 19:45.141
It is the senator here who provided us
with this fabulous feast for tonight.

19:45.157 --> 19:47.611
Maybe we can leave the
political debate alone for a while?

19:47.626 --> 19:48.923
Oh, absolutely, of course.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.831
Maybe one day, he can even
cater my wedding,

19:50.845 --> 19:53.733
although he'd have to be voted out of
office for that to happen, right?

19:53.748 --> 19:54.922
Not necessarily.

19:54.935 --> 19:57.241
My senatorial duties don't
preclude catering.

19:57.257 --> 19:59.091
Kevin, talk.

19:59.105 --> 20:01.601
Now, please.

20:02.337 --> 20:03.871
Take your time.

20:03.926 --> 20:07.080
The one contribution you made to this
party is to bring senator homophobe.

20:07.097 --> 20:09.091
Kevin, I really thought that you
and I were done with this.

20:09.105 --> 20:10.801
Oh, god, you miss the point!

20:10.817 --> 20:12.091
Okay, okay.

20:12.107 --> 20:15.911
It is one thing to go and work for the
guy, which I have finally come around to.

20:15.927 --> 20:19.080
But to bring him to m--our house,
to my mother's birthday party?

20:19.095 --> 20:21.051
He gave us his chef.

20:21.066 --> 20:22.261
It was the nice thing to do.

20:22.278 --> 20:23.900
Oh,you know what? You have no room to talk.

20:23.935 --> 20:25.991
What--what, sleeping with a closeted actor?

20:26.005 --> 20:27.011
Who told you?

20:27.027 --> 20:29.540
Uh, Tommy did.

20:29.558 --> 20:30.582
- What?
- I never said a word.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.641
You're the one blabbing to the entire family.

20:32.655 --> 20:34.191
Okay,whatever. Look,where did you hide the wine?

20:34.207 --> 20:36.051
I need to get grandma a drink ASAP.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.072
It's in the closet.

20:37.085 --> 20:39.233
You put the wine in my closet?

20:40.986 --> 20:42.270
Is your little boyfriend in there?

20:42.285 --> 20:44.591
he's not my boyfriend!

20:44.938 --> 20:46.453
Keep it down. What's wrong with you?

20:46.846 --> 20:48.520
all right, we're about to start the video.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.131
Where's Justin?

20:50.336 --> 20:51.691
If he does something stupid tonight--

20:51.705 --> 20:53.071
Tommy, we have to trust him.

20:53.087 --> 20:54.982
We can't, Kitty. That's why he's in rehab.

20:54.996 --> 20:56.702
No, he's in rehab to get better,

20:56.718 --> 21:00.213
and that involves taking responsibility
for things that he's already done,

21:00.226 --> 21:02.910
and he told me that he had to go see tyler.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.152
Wait. He--he what?

21:04.165 --> 21:06.673
Yeah. Yeah, I guess he had
to go apologize to her,

21:06.686 --> 21:07.922
you know, face-to-face.

21:07.938 --> 21:09.920
Kitty, you--you-- you let him go?

21:09.935 --> 21:12.271
No. No, I pinned him down
and I gave him a wedgie,

21:12.287 --> 21:13.920
but I just couldn't keep him there.

21:13.938 --> 21:15.692
What was I supposed--
of course I let him go.

21:15.705 --> 21:18.963
- I don't know.maybe
- you have to try and trust him,okay?

21:18.978 --> 21:20.921
Okay, fine, but if anything happens,

21:20.938 --> 21:22.971
it's-- it's on your hands.

21:22.988 --> 21:24.060
Kids, kids, come on.

21:24.076 --> 21:25.273
They're gonna show your video.

21:25.287 --> 21:27.293
Come on. Come on.

21:39.456 --> 21:42.111
You're like a fine wine, Nora Walker.

21:43.108 --> 21:45.243
- Happy birthday,mom.
- Happy birthday,nora.

21:45.725 --> 21:47.913
- Love you.
- We love you.

21:50.496 --> 21:52.692
if this ends up on the internet--

21:55.447 --> 21:56.951
are they...?

21:58.396 --> 22:00.230
Uh,where's the remote?

22:00.626 --> 22:02.061
How do you stop--come on!

22:02.077 --> 22:04.690
How do you--how do you-- no,no,no!

22:05.985 --> 22:07.473
Tommy, how do you turn this thing off?

22:07.485 --> 22:09.001
I can't believe this is happening.

22:09.017 --> 22:10.503
Senator, please don't watch.

22:10.516 --> 22:12.712
Please, I'm in politics.

22:12.726 --> 22:14.211
I've pretty much seen everything.

22:14.227 --> 22:18.070
there's nothing-- it doesn't--
it doesn't...

22:18.208 --> 22:21.132
- oh,joe.
- Ah,boy.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.511
Hey, Jack.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.202
Sarah.

22:40.218 --> 22:42.070
Hey, Sarah.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.151
What are you doing here?

22:44.165 --> 22:46.423
I said I'd try and make it if I felt okay.

22:46.435 --> 22:47.603
Joe, what's going on?

22:47.618 --> 22:49.112
What are you talking about?

22:49.127 --> 22:49.941
Yeah, sure.

22:49.958 --> 22:51.400
Why are there cops here anyway?

22:51.416 --> 22:53.352
And who the hell are those guys?

22:53.367 --> 22:55.323
Oh, those are serfs.

22:55.336 --> 22:58.760
Senator, would--would you like some wine?

22:58.777 --> 22:59.712
I thought this was a dry party.

22:59.725 --> 23:02.470
Mm-hmm, but I-- I know a guy.

23:02.487 --> 23:04.211
Come on.This--this way.

23:04.546 --> 23:05.612
Thanks for coming.

23:05.627 --> 23:07.750
You--you look great.

23:08.547 --> 23:10.062
I don't have a lot of time.

23:10.076 --> 23:11.240
I-I won't keep you.

23:11.255 --> 23:13.253
I-I need to get back to my mom's party anyway.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.870
I just.

23:16.296 --> 23:18.382
I came to apologize.

23:18.796 --> 23:22.352
I'm not here to make an excuse, because
there is no excuse for what I did.

23:24.417 --> 23:26.013
But I--I'm in rehab.

23:26.026 --> 23:27.512
So you're out making amends,huh?

23:27.528 --> 23:29.692
That's part of the program, isn't it?

23:30.737 --> 23:32.421
How high up am I on your list?

23:32.436 --> 23:34.540
You're right under my family.

23:35.895 --> 23:37.953
Look, that night I got high at the hotel,

23:37.966 --> 23:39.131
I don't even remember much.

23:39.148 --> 23:41.233
And--and that girl, honestly,

23:41.248 --> 23:42.482
she's just someone I used to use with.

23:42.498 --> 23:44.940
We just try to forget
about stuff together.

23:44.956 --> 23:47.542
What were you trying to
forget about that day,me?

23:47.555 --> 23:48.611
No. Tyler, look,

23:48.627 --> 23:51.391
you were the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

23:51.406 --> 23:53.511
What do you want me to say?

23:53.958 --> 23:57.233
Justin, you may have
been high, but I wasn't.

23:58.047 --> 24:00.081
And I remember everything.

24:00.097 --> 24:02.511
God, look, I am so sorry.

24:04.778 --> 24:05.973
I get out in a week.

24:05.987 --> 24:07.390
- C-can I see you?
- Justin

24:07.407 --> 24:08.803
look, it doesn't have to be a date,right?

24:08.818 --> 24:10.612
You--you can bring one of my family members.

24:10.628 --> 24:11.613
Just pick one.I--

24:11.627 --> 24:13.533
I'm seeing someone.

24:15.528 --> 24:17.842
That--I--that's great.

24:18.705 --> 24:21.950
That's great. I'm--I'm--I'm-- I'm
really-- I'm really happy for you.

24:24.856 --> 24:26.711
What are you gonna do after rehab?

24:27.375 --> 24:29.152
I'm going back.

24:29.618 --> 24:31.322
Uh, to the middle east.

24:31.335 --> 24:33.871
They--they called me to iraq.

24:34.495 --> 24:36.292
Oh,my god.

24:38.646 --> 24:41.112
You found out that day, didn't you?

24:41.127 --> 24:42.533
Why didn't you tell me?

24:42.547 --> 24:44.381
I didn't want to use it as an excuse.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.132
Oh, justin.

24:50.397 --> 24:51.750
Uh,yeah,you know,you--you should go.

24:51.767 --> 24:53.473
I don't want to keep you.

24:54.707 --> 24:56.093
Yeah.

25:00.757 --> 25:02.810
um, tell your mom I said happy birthday.

25:02.828 --> 25:04.361
Yeah.

25:11.047 --> 25:13.653
this is where you keep the wine,
where do you keep your clothes?

25:14.558 --> 25:17.612
Oh,just shut your mouth and
come on. Shut the door.

25:23.395 --> 25:27.041
I am having, like, a fifth grade
flash back of dina segerson

25:27.055 --> 25:28.940
and seven minutes in heaven.

25:29.206 --> 25:30.432
Have you always been a closet drinker?

25:30.447 --> 25:31.212
Are you done?

25:31.225 --> 25:32.992
No, I'll--I'll think of some more.

25:35.407 --> 25:37.823
This is quite a collection.

25:37.838 --> 25:39.680
Oh, yeah.

25:40.388 --> 25:43.052
If only my shoes could talk.

25:43.128 --> 25:44.531
These are sufficiently slutty.

25:44.546 --> 25:46.352
What's their story?

25:47.076 --> 25:49.020
Hamptons, 2002,

25:49.038 --> 25:52.302
broke a heel dancing on a table,
got sandwiched in between this,

25:52.805 --> 25:55.880
uh, club promoter and some
tortured playwright.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.290
Do you want to explain those?

25:58.305 --> 26:00.103
oh,my god.

26:00.117 --> 26:02.623
Yes. Halloween two years ago.

26:03.678 --> 26:07.671
tribeca loft party, uh, Jonathan
and I went as sonny and cher.

26:07.688 --> 26:08.642
Jonathan?

26:08.655 --> 26:09.650
Uh,yeah.

26:09.665 --> 26:11.651
Uh, jonathan, my

26:11.697 --> 26:13.250
ex-fiance.

26:13.267 --> 26:15.963
Yeah,I'd rather talk about my shoes.

26:16.555 --> 26:18.252
Understood.

26:18.266 --> 26:21.453
You know, tonight was unusually
bizarre, even for my family.

26:21.467 --> 26:23.311
Are you kidding me? It's been fantastic.

26:23.326 --> 26:26.231
It's like dinner theater or the circus.

26:26.855 --> 26:29.752
Well, you certainly managed to
charm the pants off thringleader.

26:29.768 --> 26:33.491
I think my mother was actually
batting her eyelashes at you.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.551
There was no batting.

26:34.567 --> 26:37.043
Senator, there was, and you don't
have to be modest with me.

26:37.055 --> 26:39.652
Please, we're in a closet. Call me robert.

26:39.957 --> 26:43.810
Okay, well, robert, so now that you've
managed to make my mother fall in love with you,

26:43.827 --> 26:47.433
why don't you just tell kevin
that you have a gay brother?

26:48.048 --> 26:50.253
Mm, because I don't trade in
that kind of currency.

26:50.267 --> 26:53.470
I'm no gonna use my brother to
get your brother's approval.

26:55.217 --> 26:57.690
well, it would make things a lot easier.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.020
Make what easier?

27:06.515 --> 27:08.763
Mm, sorry.

27:11.156 --> 27:13.463
You know, we've been in here
for, like, over a minute now,

27:13.478 --> 27:14.591
and we haven't even done anything.

27:14.607 --> 27:17.531
I've gotten more action from Dina
Segerson in the fifth grade.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.030
I can't.

27:19.688 --> 27:20.882
And it's not that I don't want to--

27:20.895 --> 27:22.951
I don't mean that I-- I do want to.

27:22.965 --> 27:25.242
It's just that even if I did want to,

27:25.255 --> 27:26.541
I couldn't.

27:26.556 --> 27:29.252
With that kind of logic,are you
sure you're not a democrat?

27:29.568 --> 27:31.612
Besides,I'm on a fast.

27:32.418 --> 27:36.870
My.my mom and I made a pact,a man-fast.

27:36.888 --> 27:37.983
- A man-fast?
- emm

27:37.995 --> 27:39.843
- Meaning?
- No men.

27:39.965 --> 27:41.463
You know, temporarily.

27:41.478 --> 27:44.353
Well, as you can see, I've--I've
worn a lot of shoes in my life.

27:44.368 --> 27:48.980
So now it's just time to focus on
me for a while and go barefoot.

27:48.998 --> 27:50.793
Okay.

27:51.845 --> 27:54.482
But hypothetically speaking?

27:54.495 --> 27:56.320
You mean hypothetically if
I didn't work for you?

27:56.337 --> 27:57.760
Hypothetically speaking,of course.

27:57.775 --> 28:00.200
You'd be the first pair I'd try on.

28:04.336 --> 28:06.803
I just don't understand. I'm out
of commission for eight hours,

28:06.817 --> 28:08.973
and the party turns into
a medieval circus.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.712
Yeah, well, you ordered
this medieval circus,

28:10.727 --> 28:12.510
which happens to be the
most expensive package.

28:12.525 --> 28:15.560
No, I-I ordered the med-- the mid-

28:15.575 --> 28:16.943
- the mid-level.
- Ding.

28:16.957 --> 28:18.352
Oh, my god.

28:18.877 --> 28:21.562
Oh, mom, I am so sorry about your party.

28:21.576 --> 28:23.932
Sweetie, no one really saw anything.

28:23.946 --> 28:25.062
Well,speak for yourself.

28:25.075 --> 28:26.673
Uh,uh,uh, the theme.

28:26.686 --> 28:28.223
She's--she's upset about the theme.

28:28.235 --> 28:29.733
The theme is so festive.

28:29.747 --> 28:30.883
- Oh,come on,mom.
- It's so festive.

28:30.895 --> 28:32.880
There is armor on the wall.

28:32.895 --> 28:34.413
There are serfs in the bathroom.

28:34.427 --> 28:36.220
and where's all the wine?

28:36.236 --> 28:38.703
I mean, isn't that all they did
in the middle ages, drink wine?

28:38.715 --> 28:40.163
And what's with all the state troopers?

28:40.175 --> 28:42.882
Oh, they are state troopers,
and they're my fault.

28:42.897 --> 28:43.590
Senator.

28:43.608 --> 28:44.530
How you doing?

28:44.548 --> 28:47.572
And we had to promise no wine
when we took justin out of rehab.

28:47.588 --> 28:48.661
Out of where?

28:48.678 --> 28:50.022
mother.

28:50.037 --> 28:51.950
Justin is in a rehab program.

28:51.965 --> 28:52.962
He's a drug addict.

28:52.975 --> 28:54.761
Oh, mom, a little more discretion.

28:54.777 --> 28:56.463
We are in the presence of a U.S.Senator.

28:56.478 --> 28:57.870
Well, it's nothing to be embarrassed of.

28:57.887 --> 28:59.121
Oh, but homosexuality is?

28:59.135 --> 29:00.912
oh, kevin, you know, please, enough.

29:00.925 --> 29:03.680
Can you just please tell him
that you have a gay brother, too?

29:03.696 --> 29:05.081
Who's gay?

29:05.735 --> 29:07.951
I think you just outed two
brothers for the price of one.

29:07.968 --> 29:09.070
Thanks, Kitty. That would be me,

29:09.088 --> 29:10.352
grandma.I'm gay.

29:10.366 --> 29:12.012
Oh, you're not gay.

29:12.027 --> 29:12.871
Justin, maybe.

29:12.888 --> 29:15.952
But you-- oh,I-I-I-I am,uh,gay.

29:15.965 --> 29:17.603
I swear. I am.

29:17.988 --> 29:19.820
Oh, mother, stop acting so horrified.

29:19.838 --> 29:21.521
You are loving every second of this.

29:21.535 --> 29:24.073
Pietro, do that pick up?

29:24.086 --> 29:26.872
Why is everybody in the kitchen, huh?

29:27.198 --> 29:28.480
Is everything okay?

29:28.497 --> 29:29.403
Well, hardly.

29:29.416 --> 29:32.090
Justin is an addict, Kevin is gay,

29:32.105 --> 29:35.330
and--and this one is shooting
pornographic movies.

29:35.346 --> 29:36.791
Pornographic what?

29:36.805 --> 29:39.821
The sex tape that you and Joe shot,

29:39.835 --> 29:41.881
it ended up on my video.

29:42.027 --> 29:43.541
- Oh,no.
- Yeah.

29:43.555 --> 29:45.860
- No,it didn't.
- yes,it did.

29:46.508 --> 29:48.300
Joe.

29:48.576 --> 29:49.943
Joe.

29:50.197 --> 29:51.611
Why didn't you tell me about the tape?

29:51.627 --> 29:54.152
Hon, I was gonna tell you after the party.

29:54.168 --> 29:57.842
- I didn't to ruin your party here.
- We're supposed to be a team.

29:58.246 --> 29:59.930
Uh,we were a team.

29:59.947 --> 30:01.351
It's not funny!

30:01.368 --> 30:03.970
What else don't I know about this family?

30:03.988 --> 30:05.003
Ma,let's go sit down,okay?

30:05.017 --> 30:05.901
No, no, Saul.

30:05.915 --> 30:07.842
She wants to know so I'm gonna tell her.

30:08.395 --> 30:12.053
Mother, William cheated on me.

30:12.065 --> 30:14.083
Yes! Is that what you wanted to hear?

30:14.096 --> 30:17.043
William had an affair with another
woman for almost half my marriage--

30:17.058 --> 30:19.663
and not only that,hold on--
he was an embezzler.

30:19.675 --> 30:21.782
As it turns out,a very
successful embezzler,

30:21.796 --> 30:23.810
but an embezzler nonetheless.

30:23.826 --> 30:25.131
So it turns out you were right.

30:25.146 --> 30:26.311
Are you happy now?

30:26.326 --> 30:27.913
Of course I'm not happy.

30:27.925 --> 30:30.923
I'm not surprised,but I'm not happy.

30:30.935 --> 30:32.571
- What are you--you-
- okay,okay,okay,mom.

30:32.585 --> 30:33.611
That's it,that's it.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.862
Let's go. That's enough.

30:34.877 --> 30:35.710
Where?

30:35.726 --> 30:38.212
I'm taking you to my house, and
tomorrow morning you're flying home.

30:38.227 --> 30:39.443
Well,what did I do?

30:39.456 --> 30:41.740
It's Nora's birthday, mom.

30:41.755 --> 30:45.121
She's had a terrible year, and you haven't
been nice to her since you got here.

30:45.465 --> 30:47.383
I'm sorry I invited you.

30:48.187 --> 30:49.993
I really am.

30:51.455 --> 30:53.112
I have never

30:53.126 --> 30:54.772
understood this family.

30:54.787 --> 30:57.123
That's because you never even tried.

31:03.496 --> 31:04.912
- Mom-
- no,nora.

31:04.925 --> 31:06.561
It's--it's okay.

31:15.347 --> 31:16.822
that was some serious family drama.

31:16.835 --> 31:19.002
I think you finally drove off McCallister

31:19.017 --> 31:20.272
and his band of merry me

31:20.287 --> 31:23.302
Good. I'm sure kitty's apologizing
for us all right now.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.361
Oh,whatever.

31:24.375 --> 31:27.621
At least your asses weren't
plastered all over a plasma.

31:27.638 --> 31:29.342
Don't laugh. It's not funny.

31:29.356 --> 31:31.220
I can't even look at you people anymore.

31:31.235 --> 31:32.503
Imagine how we feel.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.053
Yeah. Bold choice with the couch.

31:34.067 --> 31:35.783
- Oh, stop it.
- Have you been doing yoga?

31:35.798 --> 31:37.321
Okay, that's enough.

31:37.336 --> 31:39.151
Meanwhile, can we talk about
grandma for a second?

31:39.168 --> 31:40.410
I know, I know.

31:40.428 --> 31:41.852
I mean, you know she's nice to us,

31:41.867 --> 31:43.771
but I forget with mom, she's joan crawford.

31:43.788 --> 31:45.380
Can you imagine having that as your parent?

31:45.397 --> 31:46.881
You gotta hand it to her. I mean,

31:46.895 --> 31:48.943
she turned out pretty well considering.

31:48.957 --> 31:51.482
- Yeah.
- To mom.

31:53.025 --> 31:54.483
Justin.

31:54.745 --> 31:56.223
And I'm the one in rehab.

31:56.235 --> 31:58.302
Uh,where--where the hell have you been?

31:58.318 --> 32:00.532
Not been drinking, unlike you drunk bastards.

32:00.545 --> 32:02.143
Wait, come in. Shut the door.

32:02.155 --> 32:03.582
It's like a speakeasy in here.

32:03.598 --> 32:05.680
We were just-- just getting wasted.

32:05.696 --> 32:07.300
Relax. I'm not gonna ground you.

32:07.318 --> 32:10.053
So, uh, how'd it go with Tyler?

32:10.065 --> 32:12.873
She's great. She's seeing someone already.

32:13.676 --> 32:15.450
To Tyler!

32:15.467 --> 32:17.663
You suck. Both of you.

32:20.066 --> 32:23.280
Mother, stop it. Now stop packing. Stop it.

32:23.297 --> 32:27.480
You.are...not going anywhere tonight.

32:28.676 --> 32:30.822
I know you never liked him...William.

32:30.838 --> 32:32.703
What--what was it you always called him,

32:32.718 --> 32:35.530
the...the charmer, the...the

32:35.548 --> 32:37.690
- operator.
- The operator.

32:37.708 --> 32:40.782
Yes, the operator.

32:40.795 --> 32:42.130
You didn't want me to get hurt.

32:42.147 --> 32:43.980
You were being my mother.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.171
When I think of somebody hurting my kids.

32:46.827 --> 32:48.611
but,mother,listen to me.

32:48.626 --> 32:52.780
Grown-up kids make big old grown-up mistakes.

32:53.615 --> 32:55.571
And you were right, weren't you?

32:57.215 --> 33:01.000
I've tried to imagine why he needed somebody else.

33:02.158 --> 33:04.442
I don't think I'll ever understand it.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.832
But I want you to know,

33:06.846 --> 33:08.830
mother,we had a good marriage.

33:08.847 --> 33:09.763
I know.

33:09.775 --> 33:11.033
You do?

33:11.045 --> 33:12.511
Your father.

33:12.755 --> 33:15.833
spent all of his life in the office.

33:15.847 --> 33:17.491
Or at least,that's what he said.

33:17.856 --> 33:21.720
In any case,it was hardly a great marriage.

33:21.737 --> 33:23.573
Not even a good one.

33:24.275 --> 33:26.422
And when I looked at yours,

33:26.868 --> 33:28.890
I could see the difference.

33:30.256 --> 33:32.560
There were times when I...I almost left.

33:32.576 --> 33:34.233
Why didn't you?

33:35.746 --> 33:37.750
You and saul.

33:37.768 --> 33:41.352
And. I didn't want to be alone.

33:42.455 --> 33:46.383
I realize no that I am anyway.

33:48.528 --> 33:52.602
Now, Nora, I wanted to come to William's funeral.

33:52.998 --> 33:57.120
I thought that since I'd said
so many terrible things about him

33:57.138 --> 33:58.930
you wouldn't want me there.

33:59.297 --> 34:05.373
So I told you about the cruise because I
wanted to give you an easy way for you to say

34:05.387 --> 34:07.113
"don't come."

34:07.275 --> 34:09.431
Oh, mother.

34:13.147 --> 34:15.371
I should've insisted that you come.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.811
I just didn't want to take
care of you that day.

34:17.826 --> 34:20.541
I wanted somebody to take care of me.

34:24.568 --> 34:27.913
Here. I didn't have a chance to go shopping.

34:28.936 --> 34:29.992
I got that--

34:30.005 --> 34:33.882
that frame through one
of those catalogs.

34:36.437 --> 34:38.301
That's you.

34:39.306 --> 34:42.302
That's the oldest picture I could find.

34:43.695 --> 34:46.143
You were so beautiful

34:46.158 --> 34:48.060
even as an infant.

34:48.074 --> 34:50.203
There wasn't a day I
didn't hear someone say

34:50.217 --> 34:53.590
you looked like a sears roebuck doll.

34:54.527 --> 34:56.260
Thanks, mom.

34:59.747 --> 35:02.503
Now if you don't mind, I'm just
gonna lie down for a little while.

35:02.936 --> 35:05.472
I don't feel like going back to that party.

35:05.486 --> 35:06.720
All right.

35:07.515 --> 35:10.963
If there's cake, do you
want me to come get you?

35:13.506 --> 35:15.293
Not so much.

35:15.307 --> 35:16.843
All right.

35:19.557 --> 35:23.023
Nora, you must've done something right.

35:23.035 --> 35:26.673
You've got a house full of children.

35:26.688 --> 35:29.952
If I didn't call Saul on sundays,

35:29.968 --> 35:33.451
I don't think I would ever hear
from either one of you.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.132
That's not true.

35:41.838 --> 35:43.830
I'm glad you came,mom.

36:27.368 --> 36:28.402
You made coffee.

36:28.418 --> 36:30.923
I was hoping to take you to
Jinky's for breakfast.

36:30.938 --> 36:33.512
Oh, it's much cozier here. Don't you think?

36:33.945 --> 36:35.713
Oh, thank you.

36:35.918 --> 36:38.232
If you're hungry, I have
some leftover birthday cake.

36:38.248 --> 36:39.353
Oh,that's right.

36:39.367 --> 36:41.830
How was the party? I never asked.

36:41.848 --> 36:43.482
it was insane.

36:43.496 --> 36:48.000
It was kinda like this huge
family meltdown, only really fun.

36:48.937 --> 36:50.990
Oh, senator McCallister was there.

36:51.006 --> 36:51.670
You're kidding.

36:51.687 --> 36:52.910
No.

36:52.925 --> 36:54.071
His brother is gay,you know?

36:54.085 --> 36:55.151
Yeah,I know.

36:55.165 --> 36:57.033
He cruised me once at the gym.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.163
It must be almost impossible
for you to work out.

37:02.286 --> 37:04.043
hang on a second.

37:04.825 --> 37:06.083
hey.

37:06.978 --> 37:08.831
Ah, just at some friend's house.

37:08.848 --> 37:10.770
Yeah, I'd love to shoot some hoops later.

37:10.786 --> 37:12.432
I'll give you a call?

37:12.447 --> 37:13.751
Right on.

37:15.497 --> 37:17.153
sorry about that.

37:17.167 --> 37:19.551
Well,of course. That's where you are now.

37:19.827 --> 37:21.660
Some friend's house.

37:22.015 --> 37:23.141
- Kev
- no,I know.

37:23.156 --> 37:26.430
It's just, I'm--I'm not used to
being this guy, you know?

37:26.446 --> 37:28.390
I've always been the one with intimacy issues.

37:28.408 --> 37:30.630
I've always been the one feeling bad

37:30.647 --> 37:32.703
because I've let someone down.

37:35.937 --> 37:38.383
Come on, let's go to Jinky's.

37:39.765 --> 37:41.182
Really?

37:42.128 --> 37:44.732
Breakfast in the outside world?

37:44.746 --> 37:46.442
Gee, I'm the luckiest guy in town.

37:46.455 --> 37:47.723
Don't make fun of me.

37:47.738 --> 37:49.151
Come on. Let me look in my closet.

37:49.168 --> 37:51.690
Maybe I can find you a little disguise.

37:52.877 --> 37:54.661
Oh, god.

37:55.956 --> 37:57.010
Bro,you okay?

37:57.026 --> 37:58.870
Okay, first thing, let's--

37:58.886 --> 38:01.590
let's retire "bro" from the bedroom.

38:01.606 --> 38:03.762
And second...oh, excuse me.

38:04.855 --> 38:06.732
Tommy,just come here.

38:06.745 --> 38:10.403
The last thing in the world you want
to do is get julia and the fetus sick.

38:10.898 --> 38:12.051
All right,"baby."

38:12.067 --> 38:14.111
Whatever. Just come here.

38:14.935 --> 38:16.763
Okay, I'll see you soon.

38:16.777 --> 38:18.340
Tommy's got it,too.

38:18.355 --> 38:19.313
How's your sister?

38:19.325 --> 38:20.731
Oh, she's not moving.

38:20.746 --> 38:23.040
We all spent too much time in the closet.

38:23.056 --> 38:24.342
How do you feel?

38:24.356 --> 38:25.382
Better.

38:25.395 --> 38:27.973
Now that your grandmother is
on her way to the airport.

38:27.988 --> 38:30.512
Oh,yeah.We've all decided we--

38:30.526 --> 38:33.013
We all feel terrible about your childhood.

38:33.028 --> 38:35.142
Well, that's a reversaL.

38:36.315 --> 38:39.101
I just hope I'm not like her.

38:41.005 --> 38:42.351
But I think I am a little like her.

38:42.366 --> 38:44.800
I mean, I'm opinionated like her and stubborn

38:44.816 --> 38:47.453
and she says whatever the
hell comes to her mind like--

38:47.468 --> 38:51.363
Yeah, not such a bad role
model for a girl in the '50s,

38:51.378 --> 38:52.790
or a gay man now.

38:52.808 --> 38:55.132
Genetics-- very strong thing.

38:55.558 --> 38:56.951
You look awful.

38:56.965 --> 38:58.531
Thank you, Ida.

38:58.646 --> 39:00.300
- Good morning.
- Morning.

39:00.317 --> 39:01.843
- Is she off?
- Yep.

39:02.676 --> 39:05.300
She's headed back to the desert
with the rest of the scorpions.

39:05.318 --> 39:06.040
Oh, don't.

39:06.058 --> 39:07.883
They're like little mini lobsters.

39:07.896 --> 39:09.430
Saul!

39:10.528 --> 39:12.401
Oh,honey.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.390
I'll bring you some tea when you're finished.

39:14.407 --> 39:16.572
I should be wearing a mask.

39:22.168 --> 39:23.692
Saul.

39:23.976 --> 39:27.843
Thank you for last night
and everything with mother.

39:29.546 --> 39:31.820
You haven't done that since.

39:31.835 --> 39:35.590
right after my seventh grade
christmas recital. Remember?

39:35.608 --> 39:37.520
Yeah. She said you couldn't sing.

39:37.535 --> 39:40.161
Well, I can't sing, but she
didn't have to tell me.

39:40.176 --> 39:41.582
Right.

39:42.555 --> 39:45.321
You're a good big brother, then and now.

39:45.908 --> 39:49.712
I couldn't pick a better person
know for every chapter of my life.

39:49.955 --> 39:51.650
We both lucked out.

39:52.428 --> 39:54.032
- Here.
- Okay.

39:55.146 --> 39:58.900
You have to rinse those before
you put 'em in the dishwasher.

39:59.478 --> 40:00.380
- Nora.
- All right.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.201
- Shut up.
- Okay.

40:02.218 --> 40:03.782
Fine.

40:05.047 --> 40:06.602
I'll wash 'em again later.

40:06.615 --> 40:08.251
Just go ahead.

40:15.508 --> 40:16.750
okay.

40:16.766 --> 40:18.912
How is everybody doing?

40:18.928 --> 40:20.091
I think I'm dying.

40:20.106 --> 40:21.692
This is all Sarah's fault.

40:21.707 --> 40:23.501
Is this what happens when people have kids?

40:23.515 --> 40:24.880
They spread disease?

40:24.896 --> 40:27.830
Tommy, you're building your immune
system. It's very important.

40:27.847 --> 40:30.483
Now I've got saltine crackers, I've got ginger ale,

40:30.495 --> 40:32.161
- I've got applesauce.
- Oh, god.

40:33.856 --> 40:36.320
Oh,thomas,be nice.

40:36.336 --> 40:38.502
Mother, you're really enjoying this,aren't you?

40:38.518 --> 40:41.040
No.No.

40:41.255 --> 40:42.981
Doorbell.

40:43.048 --> 40:44.411
Who could be at the door?

40:44.427 --> 40:46.072
Hare krishnas.

40:47.608 --> 40:50.442
Nora. I come bearing soup.

40:50.457 --> 40:52.433
Whoa, senator, that's so sweet of you,

40:52.447 --> 40:53.993
and un-senatorial.

40:54.006 --> 40:57.180
Well, uh, the house was smack
between speaking engagements.

40:57.195 --> 40:58.473
Really,where?

40:58.966 --> 41:00.730
San Diego and San Francisco.

41:00.747 --> 41:05.030
So I stopped at Feinberg's and I
got you 2 gallons and bagel chips.

41:05.138 --> 41:06.870
Kitty's upstairs.

41:07.475 --> 41:09.063
Oh, okay. Uh,

41:09.076 --> 41:13.501
tell her that last night was
the perfect dose of family,

41:13.517 --> 41:16.343
and that I really needed it.

41:16.356 --> 41:20.812
Well, thank you for the soup and for Pietro.

41:21.597 --> 41:24.170
And one more thing, if you don't mind.

41:24.308 --> 41:28.441
Please tell Kitty to let me know when
she's ready to go shoe shopping again.

41:29.136 --> 41:30.810
My, you are a friendly boss.

41:30.827 --> 41:33.333
Yes,I-I certainly will do that, senator.

41:33.346 --> 41:36.260
And now please go fumigate yourself.

41:36.878 --> 41:38.652
- Good to see you.
- Bye.

41:48.298 --> 41:50.551
- He brought soup.
- Oh, big whoop.

41:50.565 --> 41:53.221
Maybe he could use it as his next campaign.

41:53.238 --> 41:55.370
"Vote for me-- get soup."

41:58.108 --> 41:59.622
ooh, chicken noodle. Sweet.

41:59.636 --> 42:00.762
Oh, you're such a hypocrite, Kevin.

42:00.775 --> 42:03.750
I'm eating it doesn't mean I have to like him.

42:05.277 --> 42:07.742
You kids just eat your soup, really slowly.

42:07.756 --> 42:09.410
A chip?

42:10.457 --> 42:13.193
Oh I want a chip.
