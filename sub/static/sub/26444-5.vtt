12:46.808 --> 12:49.937
You see? I knew
they'd be happy to help.

12:50.980 --> 12:53.440
Here are just a few things Sammy
might need.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.902
A change of clothes, bottles,
binkies,

12:56.110 --> 12:57.695
snacks, toys, teething ring,

12:57.903 --> 13:01.157
extra binkies, extra snacks,
extra clothes.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.868
Igor, would you mind holding Sammy
while I get the rest of her things?

13:06.120 --> 13:07.162
There's more?

13:07.580 --> 13:10.207
How can someone so little
need so much stuff?

13:10.415 --> 13:12.083
I have no idea!

13:12.250 --> 13:14.587
[Sammy babbling]

13:14.920 --> 13:19.467
But we want little Sammy Lammy
to have everything she needs.

13:19.675 --> 13:21.552
-[Sammy babbling]
-Yes, we do,

13:21.760 --> 13:23.553
don't you--

13:23.762 --> 13:24.763
Oh!

13:26.432 --> 13:27.642
[Drac shivers]

13:28.725 --> 13:30.102
Pink snow?

13:30.310 --> 13:31.770
Amazing!

13:31.853 --> 13:33.647
You know what's really amazing?

13:33.730 --> 13:35.858
My new magic trick!

13:36.067 --> 13:38.318
-Oh, how cute!
-Aww!

13:40.905 --> 13:44.950
Oh, pink snow? That means
Sammy is happy.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.372
[Drac shivering]

13:50.497 --> 13:52.833
What happens if Sammy isn't happy?

13:53.125 --> 13:56.587
When she's unhappy her snow
starts to turn blue.

13:56.878 --> 13:59.882
And you really don't want to see
purple snow.

14:00.132 --> 14:01.467
Hehehe, good to know.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.178
Oh, I almost forgot.

14:05.262 --> 14:09.098
Sammy needs to take a nice, long nap
at midnight, or she'll get cranky.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.018
Very, very cranky.

14:11.477 --> 14:12.812
Goodbye, Super Monsters!

14:13.103 --> 14:16.523
-[Mrs. Snow] Thanks again!
-[all] Bye, Mrs. Snow!

14:17.440 --> 14:19.610
She's so cute!

14:19.902 --> 14:22.780
I can't believe we get to watch her
all night!

14:23.155 --> 14:24.865
I mean, she's cute and all.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.408
[Sammy babbling]

14:26.783 --> 14:29.537
But, she doesn't really do anything,
does she?

14:29.953 --> 14:30.955
[Sammy screams]

14:31.830 --> 14:32.998
-Oh!
-Oh!

14:34.123 --> 14:36.127
[Sammy babbling]

14:37.670 --> 14:41.257
On my first day, Cleo showed me
where everything was.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.342
Now, I can show you!

14:45.468 --> 14:47.137
[Sammy babbling]

14:48.388 --> 14:49.598
[Drac shivering]

14:50.307 --> 14:51.308
Cold!

14:54.812 --> 14:57.147
Pink snow means she's happy!

14:57.438 --> 14:58.982
-Come on!
-[Sammy babbling]

14:59.065 --> 15:00.650
This is the toy box.

15:01.277 --> 15:05.238
And over here is our art cubby.

15:07.992 --> 15:09.327
Glorb, Henri!

15:09.535 --> 15:11.453
Wanna see my new magic trick?

15:11.662 --> 15:12.997
[Glorb and Henri nod]

15:13.247 --> 15:14.915
Prepare to be...

15:15.165 --> 15:16.958
Amazed!

15:17.417 --> 15:20.503
Sammy, say hello to Henri and Glorb.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.673
[Glorb chirping]

15:26.218 --> 15:27.385
Really, guys?

15:27.887 --> 15:28.928
Oh!

15:29.095 --> 15:31.890
[Sammy babbling]

15:35.935 --> 15:37.270
[Sammy sneezing]

15:39.690 --> 15:40.690
Again.

15:42.233 --> 15:46.447
Look! Now her snow is pink and blue!
Cool!

15:46.822 --> 15:50.993
Hmm. If I make pink paint with
blue paint, I can make purple paint.

15:51.368 --> 15:52.368
So...

15:52.577 --> 15:56.290
If Sammy has pink snow,
and blue snow,

15:56.748 --> 15:59.292
It might turn into purple snow?

15:59.543 --> 16:02.128
Oh, no! We don't want purple snow!

16:02.420 --> 16:03.547
What do we do?

16:03.922 --> 16:05.173
Maybe she's hungry.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.675
Oh!

16:06.758 --> 16:09.345
Apple sauce! I know just what to do.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.390
Zoom, zoom, zoom!

16:13.682 --> 16:15.683
Here comes the witchy
witch on a broom!

16:15.767 --> 16:17.518
With a spoon!

16:18.645 --> 16:19.772
Oh!

16:20.230 --> 16:23.233
-[Katya laughing]
-[Drac] I'm glad that wasn't me.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.237
Woah!

16:26.445 --> 16:27.612
Really?

16:29.030 --> 16:30.865
If Sammy doesn't want a snack,

16:31.075 --> 16:32.702
what does she want?

16:34.077 --> 16:36.872
My crown? You want my crown?

16:37.832 --> 16:39.708
[Sammy chewing]

16:41.543 --> 16:43.212
Ugh, droolsicles.

16:43.587 --> 16:46.173
That's kind of gross.
But also kind of cool.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.592
-[Frankie] Ah?
-[Sammy babbling]

16:49.885 --> 16:51.010
Oh, no!

16:53.930 --> 16:55.307
[Drac shivering]

16:55.765 --> 16:56.850
[Drac laughing]

16:57.142 --> 16:58.560
Every time!

16:58.852 --> 17:02.230
Frankie. I think Sammy
wants to play with you.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.732
Are you sure?

17:04.065 --> 17:07.027
But I'm afraid I may accidentally
step on her.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.612
[Frankie stomps]

17:09.530 --> 17:11.657
-[Frankie laughs]
-[Sammy babbling]

17:15.077 --> 17:17.662
Not gonna move...

17:18.955 --> 17:21.417
Oh, so adorable!

17:22.208 --> 17:23.918
She sure seems happy up there.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.172
And now she seems unhappy!

17:27.547 --> 17:29.717
That snow looks almost purple!

17:30.008 --> 17:31.093
-Oh!
-Oh!

17:31.302 --> 17:34.012
[Sammy babbling]

17:34.220 --> 17:36.807
Uh. Any ideas, Super Monsters?

17:38.433 --> 17:42.145
My abuelita used to make shadow
puppets for me and my cousins.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.772
[Lobo panting]

17:44.397 --> 17:46.108
Once there was a werewolf

17:46.317 --> 17:50.237
who loved to howl at the moon!
[Lobo howling]

17:50.820 --> 17:53.615
And he had a super-fast
mommy and daddy, and

17:53.823 --> 17:55.742
and a brother, and sister,

17:55.992 --> 17:57.995
and they were super-fast too!
Zoom!

17:58.203 --> 17:59.497
[Lobo laughing]

17:59.788 --> 18:02.082
[Sammy crying]

18:03.208 --> 18:04.752
I have an idea!

18:06.795 --> 18:08.380
Peek-a-Boo!

18:08.630 --> 18:11.342
[Sammy babbling]

18:11.592 --> 18:13.760
I see a little bit of you!

18:15.012 --> 18:16.180
[Sammy babbling]

18:18.557 --> 18:20.183
Ah-choo!

18:21.768 --> 18:24.228
[Sammy sneezing]

18:27.983 --> 18:29.443
-Bottle?
-[Sammy] No!

18:29.527 --> 18:30.777
-Binkie?
-[Sammy] No!

18:31.068 --> 18:32.445
-Crown?
-[Sammy] No!

18:32.653 --> 18:33.947
-Rattle?
-[Sammy] No!

18:34.322 --> 18:36.242
-Apple sauce?
-[Sammy] No!

18:36.492 --> 18:37.783
-Ball?
-[Sammy] No!

-Blankie?
-[Sammy] No!

-Wand?
-[Sammy] No!

18:41.788 --> 18:43.165
[Sammy crying]

18:43.957 --> 18:45.708
Maybe she needs to be changed.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.462
Great idea! We need a change,
and make it funny,

18:49.713 --> 18:52.257
let's turn Sammy into a bunny!

18:54.300 --> 18:57.595
Aw, she's a cute little bunny!

18:59.055 --> 19:00.348
Good job, Katya.

Goodness! It's almost midnight,
Time for her nap.

Aren't you cold?

19:24.540 --> 19:26.458
Nah, I'm kind of getting used to it.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.085
[Sammy crying]

19:30.295 --> 19:31.588
You sure are loud.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.675
My dad always says that I
was a really loud baby too.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.468
And I didn't like naps either.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.470
Do you like magic tricks too?

19:41.097 --> 19:42.515
Ho-ho!

19:42.807 --> 19:45.393
See my hat? It's empty, right?

19:47.728 --> 19:48.897
Or is it?

19:49.105 --> 19:53.235
Watch what happens when I say
the magic word "Abrah-kadavrah!"

20:20.428 --> 20:23.723
I just wish I had a magic trick
that could help you sleep.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.475
No, no nap!

20:25.683 --> 20:27.978
Hey! I know a song you might like!

20:28.187 --> 20:31.022

I couldn't sleep.
