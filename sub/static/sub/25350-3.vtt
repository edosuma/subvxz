WEBVTT

00:10.611 --> 00:13.879
I see a dead man and a child.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.748
Grim reapers for children?

00:15.750 --> 00:17.616
My children
are being attacked.

00:17.618 --> 00:21.019
I've seen, like, these hands
come out of the bed.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.489
They're trying to get us.

00:23.491 --> 00:26.925
It's chaos out there,
all hell breaking loose.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.296
Can you imagine the kids
getting pushed like that?

00:31.298 --> 00:33.432
They're wanting
to take my child.

00:33.434 --> 00:37.769
Females tend to not
last long here.

00:37.771 --> 00:40.372
And I just feel...fear.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.240
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.510
This is like
Grand Central Station

00:44.512 --> 00:45.577
for the dead.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.711
I see dead people.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.914
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.849
I speak to dead people.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.718
She hates them --
<i>hates</i> them.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.988
And they speak to me.

00:55.990 --> 00:59.391
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.859
It's a demon.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.994
It's Satan.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.529
I rely on my partner.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.197
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.333
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:08.335 --> 01:09.668
What was the body count?
What happened?

01:09.670 --> 01:13.472
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.673
I don't know if it's
a demon or not,

01:14.675 --> 01:16.408
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.043
It's my job to reveal them.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.546
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.347
But Steve and I never speak...

01:22.349 --> 01:24.416
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.818
...until the very end.

01:25.820 --> 01:27.752
I want to show
you this.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.021
...when we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:30.023 --> 01:32.357
I just don't want anything to
happen to my mother.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.692
Or time to get out.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.294
You have to get out.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.041 --> 01:49.574
I'm out here
in Blue Springs, Missouri.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.910
It's about 20 minutes east
of Kansas City.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.978
I got a call from a young mom
named Amber

01:53.980 --> 01:55.580
who sounded really desperate.

01:55.582 --> 01:57.983
She's got a little girl
who's gone through not one,

01:57.985 --> 02:00.586
but three open-heart surgeries.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.121
And whatever's in the house
is picking on this poor kid.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.990
Frankly, it pisses me off.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.191
With all the medical bills,

02:06.193 --> 02:08.660
these guys can't even
afford to move.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.527
I really hope we can
help them out.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.334
Before Amy arrives,

02:15.336 --> 02:19.271
I sweep the house
for any leading information.

02:19.273 --> 02:23.575
Family photographs, artwork,
and religious symbols

02:23.577 --> 02:26.478
can influence her findings,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.747
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.952
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:42.630 --> 02:47.099
A bad thing happened here,
and it still lingers.

02:47.101 --> 02:50.502
Fear is the dominant
emotion here.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.171
Fear, fear, fear.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.840
I'm hearing, "This is not a safe
place for children,

02:55.842 --> 02:58.042
whether they be alive or dead,"

02:58.044 --> 03:00.245
and then I hear,
"Children go missing."

03:10.257 --> 03:11.657
Amber, when we spoke
on the phone,

03:11.659 --> 03:14.058
you had desperation
in your voice.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.861
I mean, what's going
on here?

03:15.863 --> 03:17.795
It just feels
like pure evil.

03:17.797 --> 03:22.066
Whatever is here is literally
coming after my family.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.336
My children
are being attacked.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.405
Who exactly lives here?

03:26.407 --> 03:29.274
I do have a picture.

03:29.276 --> 03:32.544
This is Daniel,
my husband, Baylee,

03:32.546 --> 03:36.881
Destiny, Jacob,
Makaya, and Kailin.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.684
How long have you lived
in the house?

03:38.686 --> 03:40.219
A little
over seven years.

03:40.221 --> 03:43.488
Okay, now was the activity
this intense right away?

03:43.490 --> 03:45.223
No, we had little things
here and there,

03:45.225 --> 03:47.292
but nothing
like it is now.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.694
What changed?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.895
Baylee, my youngest, had
her third open-heart surgery,

03:50.897 --> 03:52.831
and it seemed
around that time

03:52.833 --> 03:56.034
that things just started getting
worse and worse and worse.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.571
So, Baylee's heart condition,
what exactly's wrong?

03:59.573 --> 04:02.841
She has something called
hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

04:02.843 --> 04:06.178
In layman's terms, it pretty
much means she has half a heart.

04:06.180 --> 04:07.779
And how's she doing now?

04:07.781 --> 04:12.251
She's doing really well
physically.

04:12.253 --> 04:15.120
Mentally,
spiritually, not so well.
Okay.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.122
She's been at my sister's house
for 21/2 weeks.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.524
She won't sleep here.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.994
It's hard not having my baby
here with me.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.062
And so I'm used to,
like, holding her

04:24.064 --> 04:25.863
and, like,
feeling her heart beat.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.865
And she's already
overcome so much.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.937
There's nothing
that we can do.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.706
That's why
we called you guys.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.678
Okay, so, give me a list
of what activity

04:39.680 --> 04:40.945
is going on
in the house.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.815
Well, things move
on their own...
Okay.

04:43.817 --> 04:48.152
...physical attacks,
mood changes,

04:48.154 --> 04:50.088
my health is declining.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.423
What are
we talking about?

04:51.425 --> 04:55.427
I get extremely dizzy
to where I almost faint.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.095
My head is
constantly pounding,

04:57.097 --> 05:00.232
and I have pain back here
on a daily basis.

05:01.901 --> 05:04.569
It's just literally
a never-ending list.

05:04.571 --> 05:07.706
I mean, that's issues
for a 70-, 80-year-old woman.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.642
Right, and I feel like
I am that age.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.111
Okay.
And I'm 30 years old.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.846
It's sucking the life
out of me.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.450
So, I know about Baylee's issues
and your health issues.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.319
Anybody else
being affected?
Daniel definitely.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.989
Last Thanksgiving,
he suffered from a stroke.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.324
Stroke?
How old is he?

05:26.326 --> 05:29.060
He was 33 at the time.

05:29.062 --> 05:32.263
So, you mentioned your husband's
a vet. What branch?
Army.

05:32.265 --> 05:36.401
Being a vet myself and thinking
about another vet coming home

05:36.403 --> 05:38.603
after being in combat
and having to deal with this,

05:38.605 --> 05:40.872
this kind of pisses me
off a little bit.-

05:40.874 --> 05:42.473
How are you dealing
with it emotionally?

05:42.475 --> 05:44.542
It's difficult.

05:44.544 --> 05:47.612
The four oldest kids
all sleep in the same room.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.481
They don't want to
be alone.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.284
It's just stressful around here,
so it's hard to be happy.

05:52.286 --> 05:53.485
So, what do you think
it is?

05:53.487 --> 05:56.021
I mean, what do you think
it wants from you?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.023
I think it wants
to hurt Baylee.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.932
It's overwhelming
in this room, the emotions.

06:10.104 --> 06:11.503
I feel panic.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.572
I feel fear in this room,
and I think this is all the,

06:14.574 --> 06:18.509
you know, living's emotions,
what they're feeling.

06:18.511 --> 06:22.047
I'm hearing,
"Aneurysm, male, young."

06:25.652 --> 06:28.252
I'm getting a lot of, like,
turmoil in here,

06:28.254 --> 06:29.921
a lot of turmoil in here.

06:33.126 --> 06:39.197
Anxiety, panic attacks,
nightmares, crying,

06:39.199 --> 06:41.332
being sick a lot,

06:41.334 --> 06:44.736
like, wanting to run away.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.005
And I hear a male's voice say,
"Leave this place now."

06:55.549 --> 06:58.016
Okay, Amber, so what's
going on in the kitchen?

06:58.018 --> 07:01.953
That stock pot right there
was filled with boiling water

07:01.955 --> 07:03.154
when Baylee
and I were cooking,

07:03.156 --> 07:05.891
and we both saw it
moving towards Baylee.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.159
This pot?
Yeah.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.361
Well, it's not
a light pot.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.296
This is kind of sturdy.
Yeah.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.831
Now, I've seen a pot
when the water gets really

07:12.833 --> 07:15.166
going and boiling kind
of shake a little bit.-

07:15.168 --> 07:16.501
Could it have been that?
No.

07:16.503 --> 07:19.437
It moved diagonally,
like, 4 inches.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.306
And you're convinced it
was moving towards Baylee?

07:21.308 --> 07:23.575
It <i> was</i> moving
towards Baylee.
Okay.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.709
Alright,
so, anything else?

07:24.711 --> 07:27.579
Yeah, Baylee was shoved
in here.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.180
Okay, so, explain
what happened.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.582
Baylee was just standing
in a chair

07:30.584 --> 07:32.250
trying to get something
out of the microwave,

07:32.252 --> 07:33.718
heard her say,
"Not scared of you,"

07:33.720 --> 07:36.121
and I see her shoved.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.455
You sure
she didn't trip?

07:37.457 --> 07:40.058
There's no way that she could
have went from the chair

07:40.060 --> 07:44.262
all the way with her head
almost near the dishwasher.

07:44.264 --> 07:48.332
She thinks that she's
being hurt for a reason.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.868
She doesn't know why,
but she feels

07:49.870 --> 07:52.003
like something's
after her.

07:56.743 --> 07:59.678
There's, like, a smart-ass here,
this guy who's here.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.879
There's a male here.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.682
He's just a real smart-ass,
real smart-ass.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.287
You know, I think, you know,

08:09.289 --> 08:14.826
he's got a really strong
presence and personality,

08:14.828 --> 08:16.694
not real cool with women.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.164
The living might feel agitated.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.038
I know there's a telepath here.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.107
I want to say it's this
**** guy.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.376
This person can get
in your mind,

08:31.378 --> 08:34.179
like, giving people nightmares.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.447
He doesn't like women

08:35.448 --> 08:38.448
and in a way
that he likes to scare them,

08:38.451 --> 08:40.650
he likes to make them
feel afraid.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.655
He's very physical --
being forced down,

08:43.657 --> 08:45.256
being pushed down --

08:45.258 --> 08:48.659
so females tend
to not last long here.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.568
Okay, so, what's going on
in here?

08:56.570 --> 08:58.270
Nightmares.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.338
You're having nightmares?
Yeah.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.673
Okay, what kind?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.741
Things happening
with my family.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.677
Could it be a side effect
from some of the medication?

09:05.679 --> 09:06.678
Have you looked into that?
No.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.746
Nope, doesn't go
with any of that.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.882
Anybody else having
the dreams you are?

09:10.884 --> 09:14.486
Yes, Baylee has them
every single night.

09:14.488 --> 09:15.820
Anything else?

09:15.822 --> 09:17.622
Sleep paralysis.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.757
Okay,
so what happens?

09:19.759 --> 09:23.828
Heavy pressure on my chest,
I can't breathe,

09:23.830 --> 09:25.496
I can't talk,
I can't move.

09:25.498 --> 09:29.100
That's pretty scary.
Yeah, it is scary.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.234
Anything else?

09:30.236 --> 09:34.572
I wake up with scratches.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.173
Looks like
an animal attack.

09:38.645 --> 09:41.379
I mean,
you got pets here?

09:41.381 --> 09:42.514
Yeah, we do.

09:42.516 --> 09:45.383
We have two cats
and some bunnies,

09:45.385 --> 09:47.385
but they're not allowed
in this room.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.721
'Cause this is no way
to live.
Mnh-mnh.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.189
Now we're here.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.257
What are you hoping
we can do for you?

09:53.259 --> 09:57.195
I just want my health
to get better.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.498
I want my child to come
back home at night

10:00.500 --> 10:03.134
and not be afraid
to be here.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.201
I just want peace.

10:04.203 --> 10:05.737
I just want my home back,

10:05.739 --> 10:08.539
and I just want them
to get the **** out.

10:12.478 --> 10:18.216
Alright, so, this dude, he makes
people unhappy generally.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.352
Yeah, there's too
much activity in the bed.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.687
He's, like,
shaking somebody around.

10:22.689 --> 10:25.623
He's pushing somebody around.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.825
He's getting rough with somebody
in the bed.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.496
And they know it.

10:32.498 --> 10:33.998
This is a living,
I believe, woman.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.168
Waking her up and pushing her
around, you know.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.837
This is on
a pretty consistent basis,

10:39.839 --> 10:43.441
whispering nasty stuff
into her ear

10:43.443 --> 10:45.110
just like,
"You're gonna die,"

10:45.112 --> 10:49.180
like, wicha-wicha-wicha
"**** you're gonna die."

10:49.182 --> 10:50.581
So, what does he want
from her?

10:50.583 --> 10:52.050
For her to leave.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.986
It seems like he tends
to run females out of here.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.857
What would happen to her
if she stayed?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.725
She might go missing.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.194
That's what he says.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.796
"She might go missing."

11:31.324 --> 11:34.075
So, Dan, I spoke with your wife today.

11:34.076 --> 11:36.827
Sounds like whatever's going on
in this house is pretty dangerous.

11:36.828 --> 11:38.761
- You agree with that?
- Yeah, I do.

11:38.763 --> 11:41.097
I don't like my kids
being scared.

11:41.099 --> 11:42.298
She was talking
about Baylee,

11:42.300 --> 11:44.967
and you got to be
very concerned about that.

11:44.969 --> 11:47.570
I'm very concerned.
That's my little buddy.
Yeah.

11:47.572 --> 11:49.238
I want to find out a way
to protect her.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.107
It's hard, man.

11:51.109 --> 11:54.176
I think
about it all the time.

11:54.178 --> 11:56.378
So, have you had
your own experiences?

11:56.380 --> 11:58.380
Yeah.
What happened?

11:58.382 --> 12:01.717
Well, my first one was,
I was going down these stairs,

12:01.719 --> 12:05.854
and I felt like
I got pushed or shoved.

12:05.856 --> 12:07.056
You boozing at all?

12:07.058 --> 12:08.924
No.
Now, how did it feel?

12:08.926 --> 12:12.795
It felt like a one-handed palm
right in the middle of the back.

12:12.797 --> 12:15.131
Well, this is pretty loose.
Did this cause the fall?

12:15.133 --> 12:17.933
No, I grabbed it whenever
I was falling down

12:17.935 --> 12:20.468
and kind of pulled it.

12:20.470 --> 12:22.404
So, you fell so hard that you
ripped this out of the --

12:22.406 --> 12:24.073
Yeah, I'm not
a little guy.

12:24.075 --> 12:25.807
Did it ever happen again?

12:25.809 --> 12:29.277
Yeah, it happened about two
years later, the same thing.

12:29.279 --> 12:30.679
It was pretty bad.

12:30.681 --> 12:32.948
I had three discs explode,

12:32.950 --> 12:35.817
and I had to go
in for a surgery.

12:35.819 --> 12:38.287
Can you imagine the kids
getting pushed like that?

12:38.289 --> 12:39.488
No, I can't.

12:39.490 --> 12:42.224
It pisses me off
any time they're scared.

12:42.226 --> 12:43.692
Anything else?

12:43.694 --> 12:48.230
Just go from being in a decent
mood to irritated, angry.

12:48.232 --> 12:50.098
Do you feel that way
when you're not home?

12:50.100 --> 12:51.700
Not near as bad.

12:51.702 --> 12:53.769
Amy may tell you,
you have to leave.

12:53.771 --> 12:55.237
Now, how would you take
that information?

12:55.239 --> 12:57.906
I'd pack my kids up, and we'd
get the hell out of here.

13:01.579 --> 13:04.580
This angry guy won't
stop following me.

13:04.582 --> 13:11.386
This dude is influencing males
to be nasty to the females.

13:11.388 --> 13:14.389
But, I mean, really bad,
you know, like, bad.

13:17.195 --> 13:20.930
I know that men here
are being manipulated.

13:20.932 --> 13:23.199
They become this guy.

13:23.201 --> 13:28.737
I want to say this guy was
living here at some point,

13:28.739 --> 13:33.208
and he's left such a huge part
of his personality,

13:33.210 --> 13:35.677
and they
become that.

13:37.614 --> 13:39.281
After speaking
with Amber and Dan,

13:39.283 --> 13:41.683
I met with their kids
in the living room.

13:41.685 --> 13:43.485
What experiences
have you had?

13:43.487 --> 13:44.753
I saw, like, this, like,

13:44.755 --> 13:46.888
man figure just, like,
staring at me.

13:46.890 --> 13:49.091
Out of nowhere, I got shoved
into the vacuum,

13:49.093 --> 13:52.827
and then I got scratched
on both legs.

13:52.829 --> 13:56.164
That's what it looked like.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.767
All of them are having
bad experiences.

13:58.769 --> 14:03.839
Every once in a while,
I feel...drained.

14:03.841 --> 14:07.976
I was sleeping, and I just
randomly saw little figures

14:07.978 --> 14:10.045
crawling on the ground.

14:10.047 --> 14:11.647
What do you think's going on
in the house?

14:11.649 --> 14:14.049
There's lots
of evil things.

14:14.051 --> 14:15.451
Something bad.

14:15.453 --> 14:17.986
All I know is
they're trying to get us.

14:17.988 --> 14:20.055
And I want to get
out of this house.

14:23.861 --> 14:25.861
I'm seeing three corpses.

14:28.666 --> 14:33.468
One of the corpse dudes says,
"We have been dead a long time."

14:33.470 --> 14:38.073
He says, "We are trying
to find all the kids."

14:46.016 --> 14:48.616
The one guy's saying, "You
know, we collect all children.

14:48.618 --> 14:50.285
That's our duty."

14:50.287 --> 14:51.553
Could people see them?

14:51.555 --> 14:53.822
I think so, yeah.

14:53.824 --> 14:55.424
The men are always present.

14:55.426 --> 14:56.558
They're always here.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.960
They're always watching.

14:58.962 --> 15:01.897
They're saying,
"There's one we want here."

15:12.910 --> 15:15.177
So, Baylee,
I was talking to Mommy,

15:15.179 --> 15:17.245
and she was telling me
you're having a tough time here.

15:17.247 --> 15:19.248
You don't like
what's going on.
No.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.449
And I know you had to go
to the doctor

15:20.451 --> 15:23.451
for some things that --
for your chest, right?

15:23.453 --> 15:25.054
You feeling okay now?

15:25.056 --> 15:27.856
So, can you tell me about some
of the things that scare you?

15:27.858 --> 15:30.125
I have bad dreams
every night.

15:30.127 --> 15:31.459
You know what the dreams
are about?

15:31.461 --> 15:34.530
Creepy things that always eat
my family.

15:34.532 --> 15:37.199
But now you're at your
aunt's house and --
Yeah.

15:37.201 --> 15:40.602
And I don't
have any bad dreams.
Okay.

15:40.604 --> 15:43.271
Alright, what else
is happening to you?

15:43.273 --> 15:47.943
I've seen, like,
these shadows.

15:47.945 --> 15:49.411
Where do you see them?

15:49.413 --> 15:51.547
I saw them
inside the hallway.

15:51.549 --> 15:52.481
More than one?

15:52.483 --> 15:54.883
Yeah, I saw three.

15:54.885 --> 15:57.353
They sometimes move.

15:57.355 --> 16:01.957
Like, if I blink,
they're in a different spot.

16:01.959 --> 16:03.759
Anything else going on?

16:03.761 --> 16:07.563
I've seen, like, these hands
come out of the bed.

16:07.565 --> 16:10.432
The hands that were from
the bed reached out for me.

16:10.434 --> 16:11.900
Okay.
That's really scary.

16:11.902 --> 16:15.304
That's even scary
for a big guy like me.

16:15.306 --> 16:17.439
So, this is
a pretty cool room.

16:17.441 --> 16:18.840
Do you want
to come back here?

16:18.842 --> 16:19.975
Mnh-mnh.
No?

16:19.977 --> 16:21.243
What if we were able
to get rid

16:21.245 --> 16:23.245
of whatever's here
that's scaring you?

16:23.247 --> 16:25.714
I mean, like, I would still
want to live here,

16:25.716 --> 16:28.217
but then I would have
bad memories.

16:28.219 --> 16:30.385
Yeah, I'm sorry, honey.

16:30.387 --> 16:32.454
Alright, well, we're gonna
try to fix it anyway.

16:32.456 --> 16:34.323
Is that okay?

16:34.325 --> 16:36.058
Okay.

16:37.261 --> 16:41.262
So, these three corpses collect
a bunch of kids over time,

16:41.264 --> 16:43.732
so I'm asking, like, you know,
"Where did you come from?"

16:43.734 --> 16:44.867
The one guy's saying,
"You know, it really

16:44.869 --> 16:46.201
doesn't matter who sent us.

16:46.203 --> 16:50.138
We got a job to do.
It's not personal."

16:50.140 --> 16:53.408
They're saying they're here
for a child because it's sick.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.076
The kid's sick.

16:55.078 --> 16:58.347
I kind of think it's
a little girl.

16:58.349 --> 17:00.415
Do you know where
they want to take her?

17:00.417 --> 17:03.018
A better place.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.487
I mean,
they're not Death itself.

17:05.489 --> 17:07.790
They're just sent by Death.

17:09.893 --> 17:11.893
They're grim reapers
for children.

17:31.713 --> 17:33.980
Amber's convinced
the scratches on her body

17:33.982 --> 17:37.451
came from something paranormal,
but I'm not so sure about that.

17:37.453 --> 17:38.785
So I'm heading back there
to meet

17:38.787 --> 17:40.654
with some pest-control expert

17:40.656 --> 17:42.856
to see if maybe some
sort of animal could be

17:42.858 --> 17:45.058
leaving those marks
on Amber and her kids.

17:50.599 --> 17:51.798
Hey, Mike.
How you doing?

17:51.800 --> 17:53.333
Thanks for coming out,
appreciate it.

17:53.335 --> 17:55.002
The reason I called you,
I got a family of seven

17:55.004 --> 17:56.469
that live here.
Yeah.

17:56.471 --> 17:57.804
They're complaining
about hearing some really

17:57.806 --> 18:00.139
strange noises and attacks

18:00.141 --> 18:01.942
on them that look
like scratch marks.

18:01.944 --> 18:04.211
Can that come
from an infestation?

18:04.213 --> 18:05.679
That can happen.

18:05.681 --> 18:07.614
So, what I want to do is make
sure that there's nothing

18:07.616 --> 18:10.016
in the house
that could cause that.
Okay.

18:10.018 --> 18:11.218
Give the house a once-over,

18:11.220 --> 18:13.286
do the inspection,
and then get back to me.
Sure.

18:13.288 --> 18:14.354
Alrighty?
Yep.

18:14.356 --> 18:15.288
Alright, cool.
Thanks, buddy.

18:15.290 --> 18:16.323
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

18:18.693 --> 18:21.195
I never know what Amy's gonna
find during her walk.

18:22.697 --> 18:24.097
But when you work a homicide,

18:24.099 --> 18:26.699
you have to rule out
the obvious first,

18:26.701 --> 18:28.402
and that's exactly
what I'm doing here.

18:30.372 --> 18:32.105
So, if there are rodents
in the house,

18:32.107 --> 18:35.041
it could explain what Amber and
her family are going through.

18:35.043 --> 18:36.376
We'd exterminate those suckers,

18:36.378 --> 18:38.245
and everyone
would be good to go.

18:40.916 --> 18:42.315
How'd it go?

18:42.317 --> 18:44.817
Well, I mean, a few bird nests
on the outside of the house,

18:44.819 --> 18:47.988
a couple flies on the inside,
no rodent droppings whatsoever.

18:47.990 --> 18:50.723
Okay, so there's nothing
in there that could cause

18:50.725 --> 18:54.460
any kind of injuries
to the people living here?
No.

18:54.462 --> 18:58.065
Alright, so I know it's
nothing to do

18:58.067 --> 18:59.933
with something
you might have found...
No.

18:59.935 --> 19:01.334
...which means
I got another problem.
Yeah.

19:01.336 --> 19:02.870
Okay.

19:07.609 --> 19:09.275
I don't like this.

19:09.277 --> 19:13.346
I feel somebody being physically
assaulted in this room,

19:13.348 --> 19:18.085
being forced down, maybe pushed
down, being held down.

19:20.689 --> 19:22.822
I'm thinking it's the dead male.

19:22.824 --> 19:26.960
He's very physical,
especially with women.

19:26.962 --> 19:30.964
I just don't think women...

19:30.966 --> 19:32.498
do well here.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.301
I think they're just ****
tortured and played with.

19:38.073 --> 19:39.973
So, I just got a call
from the local sheriff.

19:39.975 --> 19:42.842
He was doing some research on
Amber and Daniel's land for me,

19:42.844 --> 19:44.444
and he hit the mother lode.

19:44.446 --> 19:46.579
Turns out another couple
who owned the property

19:46.581 --> 19:48.515
never made it out
of there alive.

19:54.856 --> 19:57.323
Well, Sheriff, I appreciate
you coming out to meet me.

19:57.325 --> 19:59.058
Before we get
to the murder-suicide,

19:59.060 --> 20:01.261
what do you know
about these people?

20:01.263 --> 20:04.263
Lois Bowlie purchased
the property in 1959.

20:04.265 --> 20:06.599
She was a successful
real estate professional.

20:06.601 --> 20:10.670
It was soon thereafter
she married Louis David Cramer.

20:10.672 --> 20:12.272
He owned a local
construction company.

20:12.274 --> 20:14.942
Okay, so, now, was this their
first marriage to each other?

20:14.944 --> 20:17.677
No, this is the fourth marriage
for both of them.

20:17.679 --> 20:19.880
They were both married
four times?
Yes, four times.

20:19.882 --> 20:21.281
They were
both married four times.

20:21.283 --> 20:24.351
Okay, so that's their
first mistake right there.

20:24.353 --> 20:25.685
What else do you know
about Lois?

20:25.687 --> 20:28.155
She was a quiet woman,
involved in the local church.

20:28.157 --> 20:29.423
What about the husband?

20:29.425 --> 20:31.024
You find anything else
about him?

20:31.026 --> 20:33.159
Yes, he was a good-looking guy,
liked to drink a lot,

20:33.161 --> 20:37.431
and he was a womanizer,
according to the family.

20:37.433 --> 20:39.566
Alright, he was
a good-looking guy.

20:39.568 --> 20:41.701
Basically, we got
a drinking womanizer

20:41.703 --> 20:43.103
marrying a churchgoing woman.

20:43.105 --> 20:44.972
Yes, opposites.

20:46.708 --> 20:49.776
This angry dead guy
has a really bad temper.

20:49.778 --> 20:52.179
Have you been able to get
anything on who he was in life?

20:52.181 --> 20:54.847
You know,
he might drink too much,

20:54.849 --> 20:56.783
might do drugs occasionally.

20:56.785 --> 20:58.719
You know, "I'm gonna drink,
and I'm gonna ****

20:58.721 --> 20:59.952
smack you upside the head,

20:59.954 --> 21:01.654
and you're going
to shut the ****."

21:01.656 --> 21:04.391
He's kind of always
in a state of agitation.

21:04.393 --> 21:07.193
"It's my way or the highway"
kind of dude.

21:07.195 --> 21:11.397
You know, hot to temper,
short fuse,

21:11.399 --> 21:13.934
kind of a fighting kind of guy.

21:17.006 --> 21:19.138
That's this guy's deal.

21:19.140 --> 21:21.407
That's this guy's personality.

21:24.479 --> 21:26.879
Okay, so obviously, this doesn't
end well for either one of them,

21:26.881 --> 21:29.282
so take me to that day
and what happened.

21:29.284 --> 21:31.151
On March 2, 1962,

21:31.153 --> 21:34.020
one of Lois' employees shows up
at the house.

21:34.022 --> 21:35.755
Okay.
So she walks in,

21:35.757 --> 21:40.427
and she finds Louis David Cramer
dead in the hallway.

21:40.429 --> 21:43.029
He was suffering from three
gunshot wounds to the chest.

21:43.031 --> 21:45.899
Now what?
The worker goes
into the bedroom and finds Lois

21:45.901 --> 21:47.467
in the bed
with a single gunshot wound

21:47.469 --> 21:50.637
to the head with a handgun
still in her grips.

21:50.639 --> 21:52.905
So, the police believed
she killed him?

21:52.907 --> 21:53.974
Yes.

21:53.976 --> 21:55.842
Then went into the bedroom
and shot herself?

21:55.844 --> 21:59.712
Yes. I have the death
certificates here.

21:59.714 --> 22:02.182
This just come out of the blue?
I mean, what happened?

22:02.184 --> 22:04.050
Not really.
She had filed for divorce twice

22:04.052 --> 22:06.719
during their short marriage,
but she withdrew both times.

22:06.721 --> 22:09.656
So obviously, these guys had
a very troubled marriage

22:09.658 --> 22:11.658
in a very short period
of time.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.126
Any idea what
those troubles were?

22:13.128 --> 22:14.727
According to the relatives,
it's possible

22:14.729 --> 22:18.265
that he could have been
physically abusive to Lois also.

22:18.267 --> 22:19.933
Okay.

22:23.072 --> 22:26.072
I'm overhearing a female
and a male fighting.

22:26.074 --> 22:28.741
"I'm gonna leave you
and this **** house."

22:28.743 --> 22:32.679
There's somebody getting hit
in the stomach here.

22:32.681 --> 22:34.014
Somebody's getting hit.

22:36.551 --> 22:40.554
Also, I'm getting head pain --
like, severe.

22:40.556 --> 22:42.088
This is a female.

22:42.090 --> 22:45.892
This isn't a headache.
This is...

22:45.894 --> 22:48.761
This is trauma to the head.

22:48.763 --> 22:51.031
**** man.

and we'll help

23:22.563 --> 23:25.363
So far, I've got a family
being physically assaulted

23:25.365 --> 23:27.499
by God knows what
on a property

23:27.501 --> 23:30.568
where a brutal murder-suicide
took place.

23:30.570 --> 23:32.304
But I want to see
if there's anything else.

23:34.642 --> 23:37.442
Combing through old records,
I find a cyclone that ripped

23:37.444 --> 23:40.979
through Amber and Dan's property
in the late 1800s.

23:40.981 --> 23:42.313
The damage was so bad,

23:42.315 --> 23:44.716
it devastated the family
who lived on the land.

23:46.653 --> 23:48.253
Well, I managed to track
down a local descendant

23:48.255 --> 23:50.722
of this poor family that was
wiped out by that storm.

23:50.724 --> 23:53.458
I'm heading over to her house
now, and she says the cyclone

23:53.460 --> 23:56.194
was fast, unexpected,
and deadly.

24:02.802 --> 24:04.870
So, Diane, I appreciate you
taking the time to meet with me.

24:04.872 --> 24:06.338
Thank you.

24:06.340 --> 24:08.473
I know the cyclone hit
in 1879.

24:08.475 --> 24:10.342
Now, who was living
on the property then?

24:10.344 --> 24:13.945
Marion Harris and his wife,
Phoebe, and their four children.

24:13.947 --> 24:15.680
Can you take me through
what happened that day?

24:15.682 --> 24:19.083
Well, it was
May 30, 1879,

24:19.085 --> 24:23.688
and the cyclone hit
about 7:00 p.m.

24:23.690 --> 24:26.091
So, this is 1879.

24:26.093 --> 24:28.793
There was no warning
systems that...
No.

24:28.795 --> 24:29.828
...anybody would know of,
right,

24:29.830 --> 24:31.363
so how'd they know
it was coming?

24:31.365 --> 24:32.764
Just when they hear it.

24:32.766 --> 24:35.099
It's supposed to sound
like a freight train.

24:35.101 --> 24:37.101
Okay, so I know this thing
was deadly.

24:37.103 --> 24:38.437
What happened?

24:38.439 --> 24:40.839
Phoebe grabbed the 8-year-old
daughter, Lilly,

24:40.841 --> 24:44.710
and the cyclone
threw them 200 yards,

24:44.712 --> 24:46.845
and they died instantly.

24:46.847 --> 24:48.647
Marion had grabbed
the baby.

24:48.649 --> 24:50.047
Ernest was 8 months old.

24:50.049 --> 24:52.383
They were thrown 150 yards,

24:52.385 --> 24:54.385
and they lived just
a short time.

24:54.387 --> 24:56.788
They died
within a few weeks.

24:59.793 --> 25:01.526
I know you said
they had four kids.

25:01.528 --> 25:02.994
What happened
to the other two?

25:02.996 --> 25:04.595
The other two lived.

25:04.597 --> 25:08.199
The boy was thrown
into a hayrick. He survived.

25:08.201 --> 25:11.870
And the girl survived,
but we don't know how.

25:11.872 --> 25:14.005
Now, Diane, you lived here
your whole life, right?
Yes.

25:14.007 --> 25:16.541
So, how often have you seen
or heard

25:16.543 --> 25:18.810
about these tornadoes
being that big?

25:18.812 --> 25:21.279
I've only heard of two
in my lifetime.

25:21.281 --> 25:23.948
You can't run fast enough
to get shelter.

25:27.287 --> 25:33.825
It's really loud,
so much going on outside.

25:33.827 --> 25:36.695
It's like **** ruckus, man.

25:36.697 --> 25:38.163
It's chaos out there.

25:38.165 --> 25:40.298
There's, like, men yelling
and, you know,

25:40.300 --> 25:42.400
all hell breaking loose.

25:45.238 --> 25:48.840
I see a dead man
and a child fall.

25:48.842 --> 25:51.776
The man has this baby
or this child, like,

25:51.778 --> 25:53.511
wrapped in his arms.

25:53.513 --> 25:58.316
Then I'm seeing this little
girl, long, straight hair --

25:58.318 --> 26:00.719
getting a pain
right side of my head.

26:00.721 --> 26:02.921
Man, that's, like, a hammer.

26:02.923 --> 26:05.590
This is a male being hit.

26:07.327 --> 26:09.594
Lord.

26:09.596 --> 26:13.665
Yeah, he got hit in the back
of the head pretty damn hard.

26:17.737 --> 26:19.804
I think he was caught off guard.

26:29.016 --> 26:31.950
I saw several horrifying things
during my walk,

26:31.952 --> 26:34.553
but one really stood out.

26:34.555 --> 26:37.622
It involved three males...

26:37.624 --> 26:39.724
...in a bedroom.

26:39.726 --> 26:44.429
Two of the males are standing
to the left side of the bed.

26:44.431 --> 26:47.232
Both of their heads
were decomposing.

26:49.703 --> 26:53.705
The other guy, he had a lot
of blood all on him,

26:53.707 --> 26:57.241
like blood and gore, really,
no bottom lip here.

26:57.243 --> 27:00.645
His nose definitely
was out a bit more.
Okay.

27:04.918 --> 27:08.186
Amy, is this what
you saw?

27:08.188 --> 27:09.320
Yes.

27:35.413 --> 27:38.348
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:38.350 --> 27:40.617
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:40.619 --> 27:43.352
and our clients
for the first time.

27:43.354 --> 27:47.223
So, Amy, I want you to meet
Amber and her husband Dan.

27:47.225 --> 27:51.027
Now, they're raising a blended
family of five kids here.

27:51.029 --> 27:52.762
Here's a picture
of everyone.

27:56.034 --> 28:00.903
Everyone is scared, and we
are literally their last hope.

28:00.905 --> 28:03.373
So, now that Amy knows
who you guys are,

28:03.375 --> 28:05.508
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

28:08.579 --> 28:11.514
During my walk,
I went to the backyard,

28:11.516 --> 28:13.716
and it's, like,
insane back there.

28:13.718 --> 28:18.121
And whatever was going on
was really stressful and crazy.

28:18.123 --> 28:20.990
I could hear people yelling
and freaking out.

28:20.992 --> 28:24.794
There was a dead man
holding a little baby.

28:24.796 --> 28:27.530
All of this residual,
it's causing a lot of stress

28:27.532 --> 28:31.200
and anxiety
for people who live here.

28:31.202 --> 28:32.802
This might be a shot
in the dark,

28:32.804 --> 28:35.805
but you saw people freaking out
and a dead man holding a child.

28:35.807 --> 28:37.540
During my research,
I came across a cyclone

28:37.542 --> 28:39.809
that hit this place in 1879.

28:39.811 --> 28:42.011
Now, this thing was about
100 yards wide.

28:42.013 --> 28:44.213
It came through the area
without warning.

28:44.215 --> 28:46.949
So, a family of six lived
on your land back then.

28:46.951 --> 28:49.952
So, the Dad picked up the baby
and tried to run.

28:49.954 --> 28:54.023
The winds tossed them 150 yards,
so the father and son died,

28:54.025 --> 28:55.892
and then Mom tried
to run to safety

28:55.894 --> 28:57.627
with an 8-year-old daughter,

28:57.629 --> 29:01.030
and they were thrown 200 yards
and killed instantly.

29:01.032 --> 29:03.499
Holy ****!

29:03.501 --> 29:07.236
Miraculously, two of their
other kids survived somehow.

29:07.238 --> 29:09.239
Damn, cyclone!

29:12.177 --> 29:14.109
So, what else?

29:14.111 --> 29:19.448
When I went into the house,
I got a lot of turmoil.

29:19.450 --> 29:22.518
The emotions in this
particular room

29:22.520 --> 29:25.187
were absolutely overwhelming.

29:25.189 --> 29:30.259
I got lots of crying, illness,
vomiting, panic attacks,

29:30.261 --> 29:33.263
people being sick a lot.

29:33.265 --> 29:34.397
Tell her about your illnesses.

29:34.399 --> 29:37.466
I get pains in the back
of my head.

29:37.468 --> 29:41.337
I get bad stabbing pain.

29:41.339 --> 29:42.605
It's nonstop.

29:42.607 --> 29:47.009
Like, I feel like
I'm 70 years old, and I'm 30.

29:47.011 --> 29:49.979
Now, you see Dan looks like
a pretty healthy guy, right?

29:49.981 --> 29:51.080
Yeah.

29:51.082 --> 29:53.215
Yeah, tell her about
what happened to you.

29:53.217 --> 29:57.420
Last Thanksgiving,
I had a ministroke.

29:57.422 --> 29:58.755
He what?
What are you, 33?

29:58.757 --> 30:00.223
34.
34 years old.

30:00.225 --> 30:01.824
And it was
in the house?

30:01.826 --> 30:03.626
Yeah.
Man.

30:07.699 --> 30:10.633
So, the next person
I meet is a male.

30:10.635 --> 30:12.168
I don't like him.

30:12.170 --> 30:18.441
He is psychologically bothering
you guys, but also physically.

30:18.443 --> 30:21.844
I'm gonna start off
with the psychological torture

30:21.846 --> 30:23.112
that he's doing.

30:23.114 --> 30:25.148
First off,
he's a telepath...

30:27.385 --> 30:30.386
...which means he can
control and influence

30:30.388 --> 30:34.924
the way living people
think and feel.

30:34.926 --> 30:38.060
And the problem with that
is that this guy

30:38.062 --> 30:42.865
is a smart-ass
and a misogynistic jerk.

30:42.867 --> 30:49.272
So an individual can start
acting completely different

30:49.274 --> 30:52.474
from the way
that they've always been.

30:52.476 --> 30:54.010
He can manipulate moods.

30:54.012 --> 30:57.547
He can make people unhappy,
and his focus is on males.

30:57.549 --> 31:04.820
He likes to get men to act
like he does against females.

31:04.822 --> 31:07.823
I get home from work in a good
mood, come in the door,

31:07.825 --> 31:11.961
and it's just like,
just get irritated,

31:11.963 --> 31:16.365
pissed off,
just want to be by myself.

31:16.367 --> 31:17.767
We're close,
and we love each other,

31:17.769 --> 31:23.439
but we can be at each other's
throats for no reason at all.

31:23.441 --> 31:25.708
The other thing he showed me
was him manipulating people

31:25.710 --> 31:29.445
while they're sleeping,
causing nightmares.

31:29.447 --> 31:34.851
I have nightmares of, like,
my family getting hurt somehow.

31:34.853 --> 31:40.056
My daughter, she has them
every single night.

31:40.058 --> 31:41.524
Which one is this?

31:41.526 --> 31:43.993
Baylee, the youngest.

31:43.995 --> 31:45.528
Yeah.

31:45.530 --> 31:50.933
She woke up, and a black hand
was over her stomach squeezing.

31:50.935 --> 31:55.204
She cried all morning
'cause she said it felt so real.

31:55.206 --> 31:57.606
This is not good.

31:57.608 --> 32:01.811
They're so bad that she's not
even staying at the house.

32:01.813 --> 32:04.681
She hasn't
for three weeks.

32:04.683 --> 32:09.552
So, getting into, like,
the physical aspect of this guy,

32:09.554 --> 32:15.291
what I saw was him picturing
a female falling

32:15.293 --> 32:17.159
down the stairs,

32:17.161 --> 32:21.897
and because of that,
that woman actually does it.

32:21.899 --> 32:25.034
So now, it didn't happen
to Amber,

32:25.036 --> 32:28.637
but Dan got pushed down
the staircase twice.

32:28.639 --> 32:29.972
<i>You</i> did?
Yeah.

32:29.974 --> 32:31.240
Really?

32:31.242 --> 32:33.709
The second time, I ended up
blowing out three discs,

32:33.711 --> 32:36.779
and I had to go in
for surgery.

32:36.781 --> 32:38.647
That's interesting.

32:38.649 --> 32:41.584
Now, a female <i> was</i> pushed.

32:41.586 --> 32:44.387
Tell her what happened
to Baylee in the kitchen.

32:44.389 --> 32:47.390
Baylee was standing
on a chair.-

32:47.392 --> 32:52.327
And she heard something say,
"I'm gonna get you,"

32:52.329 --> 32:53.796
and she said,
"I'm not scared,"

32:53.798 --> 32:56.665
and she went flying
across the kitchen.

32:56.667 --> 33:02.438
He likes to have females
feel fear.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.739
Little girls, too?

33:03.741 --> 33:06.742
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

33:06.744 --> 33:10.546
He also likes to spend time
in the master bedroom.

33:10.548 --> 33:12.681
So, I'm back there,
and I'm looking at the bed,

33:12.683 --> 33:17.887
and I'm seeing this guy, like,
attacking the living woman.

33:17.889 --> 33:20.089
He's, like,
shaking somebody around.

33:20.091 --> 33:23.025
He's pushing somebody around.

33:23.027 --> 33:25.227
He's getting rough
with somebody in the bed.

33:30.902 --> 33:32.702
Well, you were scratched
in bed.

33:33.771 --> 33:36.105
I woke up with a bunch
of scratches.

33:36.107 --> 33:38.107
Take a look at some
of these scratches.

33:40.845 --> 33:42.178
So, as far
as the scratches go,

33:42.180 --> 33:43.913
I brought in a pest-control
expert to see

33:43.915 --> 33:45.581
if there was something else
that might have caused it,

33:45.583 --> 33:47.316
but he found nothing.

33:47.318 --> 33:50.052
Any idea who this guy might
have been when he was alive?

33:50.054 --> 33:51.654
Honestly, I didn't get
much on him,

33:51.656 --> 33:56.992
but he was on the thinner side,
thick, short brown hair,

33:56.994 --> 34:00.395
definitely into drugs
and drinking, bad temper,

34:00.397 --> 34:02.431
especially with women,
violent,

34:02.433 --> 34:04.734
especially when
he'd drink alcohol.

34:04.736 --> 34:07.070
Couldn't really tell
if he died here,

34:07.072 --> 34:10.406
but I felt like he had
at some point lived here.

34:10.408 --> 34:14.944
So a womanizer, drinker,
used to live on this property...

34:14.946 --> 34:16.945
I might know
who you're talking about.

34:16.947 --> 34:19.681
This guy's name
was Louis David Cramer.

34:19.684 --> 34:23.018
In 1959, he married
the owner of this property,

34:23.021 --> 34:24.687
and her name was Lois Bowlie.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.088
So, I spoke
to the local sheriff,

34:26.090 --> 34:29.291
and he told me
Cramer was as Amy described.

34:29.293 --> 34:31.159
He was a womanizer,
he was a drinker,

34:31.161 --> 34:33.027
and according to relatives,

34:33.030 --> 34:35.565
he was physically
abusive to women.

34:35.567 --> 34:37.433
Nobody knows exactly
what happened,

34:37.435 --> 34:41.170
but on March 2, 1962,

34:41.172 --> 34:44.239
the two had a violent argument,
Lois grabbed a gun,

34:44.242 --> 34:47.710
shot him in the chest
three times, killing him.

34:47.712 --> 34:50.246
She went into the bedroom,
put the gun to her head,

34:50.248 --> 34:52.248
blew her brains out.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.116
I got both their death
certificates here.

34:54.118 --> 34:55.985
My gosh.

34:55.987 --> 35:00.456
This is his, gunshot wounds
to the chest -- three --

35:00.458 --> 35:03.192
and then this is her
bullet wound to the head,

35:03.194 --> 35:04.927
so we had a murder-suicide.

35:04.929 --> 35:06.795
Now, I couldn't get
a photo of Lois,

35:06.797 --> 35:10.199
but the sheriff I spoke
to gave me a photo of Cramer.

35:13.671 --> 35:17.339
So, is it possible that it was
Cramer that you saw?

35:17.341 --> 35:19.875
The personality
is pretty right on.

35:19.877 --> 35:22.411
That's just
**** weird.

35:22.413 --> 35:25.648
That pisses me
the **** off.
Yeah.

35:28.353 --> 35:30.019
Is there anything else?

35:30.021 --> 35:33.956
So, I met these three guys,
and I called them the corpses.

35:33.958 --> 35:36.492
They have been dead
for a long time.

35:36.494 --> 35:39.561
They have a bunch
of dead kids with them.

35:39.563 --> 35:44.433
They hover around
the last bedroom to the left.

35:44.435 --> 35:47.503
That's the kids' room,
right?

35:47.505 --> 35:52.041
Baylee talks about the three
shadows that are behind her

35:52.043 --> 35:54.410
when she walks down
out of that room.

35:54.412 --> 35:57.313
She's drawn pictures
of it.

35:57.315 --> 35:59.448
Baylee gave me
these drawings earlier today.

36:01.118 --> 36:03.051
Here's what Baylee drew.

36:03.053 --> 36:04.587
My God.

36:04.589 --> 36:06.188
Wow.

36:09.193 --> 36:13.663
So, what exactly do these three
corpses want with the kids here?

36:13.665 --> 36:18.067
What <i> they</i> told me was that,
"We're just here doing our job."

36:18.069 --> 36:21.270
They just do
what they're told

36:21.272 --> 36:25.241
and that they're here to collect
one little girl in particular.

36:27.278 --> 36:30.079
They ain't collecting
any of my kids.

36:30.081 --> 36:32.615
I did have a sketch done
of what I saw.

36:46.497 --> 36:48.097
My God.

36:51.769 --> 36:54.837
Baylee, she describes ****
like this to us all the time.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.274
That's even how she sits
in the bed.

36:59.643 --> 37:02.979
I don't like my little girl
having to see that crap.

37:02.981 --> 37:05.714
The corpses, they were saying
that they're here

37:05.716 --> 37:08.317
for the child
who is sick.

37:12.589 --> 37:14.457
She has half a heart.

37:14.459 --> 37:16.525
What?

37:16.527 --> 37:19.595
She's had three open-heart
surgeries,

37:19.597 --> 37:22.365
and she's doing good.

37:22.367 --> 37:24.367
I knew something was going on
with her.

37:28.139 --> 37:29.805
And what makes me angry is,
like,

37:29.807 --> 37:34.076
they're wanting to take my child
when she's fought.

37:34.078 --> 37:37.380
She deserves to be here,
so **** them.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.750
So, who are
these creeps?

37:40.752 --> 37:43.285
They're basically Death.

37:43.287 --> 37:45.554
Death is their boss,

37:45.556 --> 37:48.424
and so they come
and they wait and they watch.

37:48.426 --> 37:51.560
So they just watch her
all the time?

37:51.562 --> 37:53.562
Yeah.

37:53.564 --> 37:56.832
Everything you're telling me
is Baylee's okay.
Yeah.

37:56.834 --> 37:58.633
They know something
we don't?

37:58.635 --> 38:00.703
All I know
is what I report.

38:00.705 --> 38:02.138
This is what I saw.

38:05.309 --> 38:06.509
That's her baby.

38:06.511 --> 38:08.911
That's my little buddy
and her best friend.

38:08.913 --> 38:11.246
I mean, with this,
it's not an ISIS terrorist.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.849
This is something
we can't handle.

38:13.851 --> 38:15.651
Now my anxiety's
flaring up.

38:15.653 --> 38:17.920
Just, like, is my child
just gonna pass away?

38:17.922 --> 38:21.123
They just said,
"We're here because she's sick."

38:21.125 --> 38:23.592
They're watching
and waiting.

38:23.594 --> 38:24.593
They're gonna be waiting
and watching

38:24.595 --> 38:26.462
for a long
**** time.

38:50.786 --> 38:52.320
So, Amber, Dan,

38:52.322 --> 38:55.856
I'm really sorry you've had
to hear all of this tonight.

38:55.858 --> 38:58.192
You have a great kid,
a great family,

38:58.194 --> 38:59.994
and all you want to do
is live together

38:59.996 --> 39:02.730
in health and peace,
right?-

39:02.732 --> 39:05.265
Now we're gonna find out
if that's even possible.

39:05.267 --> 39:06.601
For that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:09.939 --> 39:13.541
Okay,
so first thing is,

39:13.543 --> 39:17.611
you need to set a perimeter
around the land.

39:17.613 --> 39:19.547
Get a large bag
of salt,

39:19.549 --> 39:22.884
and take that around
first the yard

39:22.886 --> 39:25.285
and then
around the house.

39:25.287 --> 39:27.621
Then I want you
to take this,

39:27.623 --> 39:31.358
and I want you to go to the four
corners of the property.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.795
Go ahead and spray that right
around the ground there.

39:34.797 --> 39:36.297
What is this stuff?

39:36.299 --> 39:39.967
It's a combination of various
things taken from voodoo,

39:39.969 --> 39:41.635
so it's super potent.

39:41.637 --> 39:44.972
The salt and this thing's gonna
keep the dead people at bay.

39:44.974 --> 39:46.307
Yes.

39:46.309 --> 39:51.178
Once that's done, I have a team
that I can get out here.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.581
Who exactly is on this team
you're talking about?

39:53.583 --> 39:55.916
They're an eclectic mix
of individuals.

39:55.918 --> 39:57.718
You've got mediums,
Reiki.

39:57.720 --> 40:00.321
You got
the whole shebang here.

40:00.323 --> 40:04.191
They are going to focus
on the interior of the house

40:04.193 --> 40:07.595
and getting rid of the dead
that have, like,

40:07.597 --> 40:10.731
basically planted
themselves firmly in here.

40:10.733 --> 40:13.333
That includes
our telepathic nutjob?

40:13.335 --> 40:14.302
Yes.

40:16.539 --> 40:20.408
But what about these
three corpses?

40:20.410 --> 40:21.942
The thing about Baylee,

40:21.944 --> 40:24.478
she's always gonna be
with the dead, you know,

40:24.480 --> 40:27.948
and she's basically
open in every way.

40:27.950 --> 40:30.484
People like her
are gateways.

40:30.486 --> 40:32.119
What's that mean?

40:32.121 --> 40:35.689
Just that they
are essentially functioning

40:35.691 --> 40:38.692
on two planes
at the same time --

40:38.694 --> 40:41.695
the living plane,
the dead plane.

40:41.697 --> 40:44.065
She's always gonna be
dealing with this, alright?

40:44.067 --> 40:47.435
It's kind of unnerving,
hearing about them

40:47.437 --> 40:49.503
just kind of lingering
around my child,

40:49.505 --> 40:50.971
but, I mean --

40:50.973 --> 40:53.040
That's kind of something
we've always known,

40:53.042 --> 40:56.110
like, the way she talks
and everything.

40:56.112 --> 40:57.311
But these guys being here

40:57.313 --> 40:59.046
doesn't mean
Baylee is sick again?

40:59.048 --> 41:00.481
No.

41:02.385 --> 41:05.319
So if they do all this
and follow your advice,

41:05.321 --> 41:06.920
I mean, will life be
a lot better for them

41:06.922 --> 41:09.523
in a couple months?
It'll be
a lot better.

41:09.525 --> 41:13.861
So this is
actually good news.

41:13.863 --> 41:15.663
We know what's going on,
who's causing it,

41:15.665 --> 41:16.864
how to get rid of it.

41:16.866 --> 41:18.465
So no more scratches,
no more getting thrown

41:18.467 --> 41:20.067
down the stairs,

41:20.069 --> 41:24.138
and she can pretty much --
for a kid with a half a heart --

41:24.140 --> 41:26.006
She can have
a normal childhood.

41:26.008 --> 41:28.142
She kicks ass.
She can handle anything.

41:28.144 --> 41:30.210
She does. She's great.
I got to ask.

41:30.212 --> 41:32.079
Are you guys gonna follow
Amy's advice?

41:32.081 --> 41:34.548
Absolutely.
Yeah, definitely.

41:34.550 --> 41:35.816
Absolutely.

41:35.818 --> 41:40.087
We ain't gonna wait
to do any of it either.

41:40.089 --> 41:46.160
I am very thankful, like,
very thankful.

41:46.162 --> 41:48.762
I'm ready for her
to come home.

41:52.368 --> 41:54.568
It's going to take
a lot of work,

41:54.570 --> 41:57.371
but if Amber and Dan
follow my advice,

41:57.373 --> 42:01.375
I'm confident they'll be able
to live in their home in peace.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.314
We followed all
of Amy's advice.

42:07.316 --> 42:10.584
Her team came out
and helped clear the house.

42:10.586 --> 42:12.453
It feels so great
in here.

42:12.455 --> 42:16.590
It's literally like light
replaced the darkness.

42:16.592 --> 42:18.859
And I have good dreams
every night,

42:18.861 --> 42:21.662
and I get to sleep
in my own room.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.597
Yeah, she doesn't have
any more nightmares.

42:23.599 --> 42:25.599
We're just very thankful
for the experience

42:25.601 --> 42:27.301
and to Amy and Steve for
everything that they've done.
