WEBVTT

00:01.512 --> 00:03.026
Previously on "Arrow"...

00:03.029 --> 00:04.915
I had no idea you were one of them.

00:08.382 --> 00:09.915
The District Attorney's Office

00:09.918 --> 00:12.017
will not be pressing
charges on your friends.

00:12.020 --> 00:15.003
Tomorrow, you will issue
one of these to each of them.

00:15.006 --> 00:16.996
They'll each be
deputized like Mr. Queen.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.849
Felicity used to force this stuff on me.

00:18.851 --> 00:20.559
There's another solve.

00:20.561 --> 00:23.654
This could be the key
to finding our mom.

00:23.656 --> 00:25.823
I want our children to know

00:25.825 --> 00:28.029
that they are the most
important thing to us.

00:28.032 --> 00:29.486
You said, "children."

00:29.489 --> 00:31.087
I'm pregnant.

00:31.089 --> 00:32.977
Ha ha!

00:33.936 --> 00:36.018
Becoming part of the SCPD is

00:36.021 --> 00:38.075
a great responsibility.

00:38.078 --> 00:39.670
The whole city will be watching you,

00:39.672 --> 00:41.672
holding you to the highest standard.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.432
And now that you're working with us,

00:43.434 --> 00:45.601
you need to learn how we do things.

00:45.603 --> 00:47.586
We have rules, protocol.

00:47.588 --> 00:49.847
And abiding by them is critical.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.850
The use of excessive force
will not be tolerated.

00:52.852 --> 00:55.093
Your objective is to
defuse the situation,

00:55.095 --> 00:56.612
not escalate it.

01:03.312 --> 01:04.861
Firearms should only be used

01:04.864 --> 01:06.290
as a last resort.

01:06.293 --> 01:08.976
Do not discharge your weapon
unless you are fired upon,

01:08.979 --> 01:11.868
or your life is in danger.

01:11.871 --> 01:14.464
All evidence against a
suspect must be gathered

01:14.467 --> 01:16.790
within the parameters of the law.

01:16.793 --> 01:19.326
Any evidence obtained not in that manner

01:19.328 --> 01:21.712
will be deemed inadmissible.

01:21.714 --> 01:25.975
In tactical situations,
avoid suspect-based decisions.

01:25.977 --> 01:28.335
This only leads to chaos and confusion.

01:28.337 --> 01:30.295
And, above all, follow the orders

01:30.297 --> 01:32.797
of the commanding officer on-site.

01:32.799 --> 01:34.871
Wearing the uniform of an SCPD officer

01:34.874 --> 01:36.090
is an honor.

01:36.093 --> 01:37.812
It isn't just a uniform.

01:37.815 --> 01:41.848
It's a symbol of the law, of justice,

01:41.850 --> 01:43.558
of transparency.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.144
Thank you, Sergeant Bingsley.

01:46.146 --> 01:48.813
Any questions?

01:48.815 --> 01:50.115
Rene.

01:50.118 --> 01:53.630
He does know we have
our own uniforms, right?

01:53.633 --> 01:54.920
Heh heh.

01:56.408 --> 02:01.436

02:02.421 --> 02:03.846
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

02:03.848 --> 02:05.422
Oh, hey!

02:05.424 --> 02:07.775
How's my favorite new
team of recruits doing?

02:07.778 --> 02:10.300
Missing the good old days
when catching a bad guy

02:10.303 --> 02:11.929
didn't involve homework.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.449
Ah. Well, this is uncharted territory,

02:14.452 --> 02:16.021
so the SCPD just wants to make sure

02:16.024 --> 02:17.711
we're on the same page.

02:17.714 --> 02:19.839
It's a lot, but it'll be worth it.

02:19.842 --> 02:21.624
I mean, we can finally work together

02:21.627 --> 02:23.025
and on the right side of the law.

02:23.028 --> 02:24.822
Wait. Does that mean that
the Black Canary's back?

02:24.824 --> 02:28.185
Well, I did get a clean bill
of health from the doctor.

02:28.188 --> 02:29.348
You all are deputized,

02:29.351 --> 02:32.224
so no reason I can't be
captain and Black Canary.

02:32.227 --> 02:34.382
Within the confines
of the law, of course.

02:34.385 --> 02:35.884
Of course.

02:35.887 --> 02:37.194
I want to be clear.

02:37.197 --> 02:38.789
Just because you've been deputized

02:38.791 --> 02:40.896
doesn't mean you have
the latitude to operate

02:40.899 --> 02:42.046
the way you once did.

02:42.049 --> 02:44.147
You work for the SCPD now.

02:44.150 --> 02:47.168
And this arrangement is
on a provisional basis.

02:47.171 --> 02:49.498
Your actions will
determine how long it lasts.

02:49.501 --> 02:50.643
Mm-hmm.

02:53.305 --> 02:55.496
I think she's starting to like us.

02:57.617 --> 02:59.759
Well, that was a different
type of workday for us.

02:59.761 --> 03:02.157
Can you believe that Pollard
made us go through all that?

03:02.160 --> 03:04.889
Well, I know we're not
used to doing things

03:04.891 --> 03:08.741
by the book, clearly,
but this partnership is

03:08.744 --> 03:09.948
what's best for the city.

03:09.951 --> 03:11.252
But she's seen what you can do.

03:11.255 --> 03:12.734
I mean, she knows what we're capable of.

03:12.736 --> 03:14.899
Just trust me. There's no
use arguing with the mayor.

03:14.901 --> 03:17.235
- Can...
- You hungry?

03:17.237 --> 03:19.510
Want a tartine, some sautéed broccolini,

03:19.513 --> 03:20.609
something like that?

03:20.612 --> 03:23.115
As much as I appreciate
the "Master Chef" initiative

03:23.118 --> 03:24.446
that you got going on here,

03:24.449 --> 03:26.262
are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

03:26.264 --> 03:29.289
Because you are 100% agreeable and Zen

03:29.291 --> 03:31.008
about this whole police 101 thing.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.676
I want this partnership to be done right

03:32.678 --> 03:34.461
and to be legitimate from the beginning

03:34.463 --> 03:36.475
for our baby

03:36.478 --> 03:38.936
because I did not get
that chance with William.

03:38.939 --> 03:40.017
This partnership's not gonna work

03:40.019 --> 03:41.356
if she forgets who she's hired.

03:41.359 --> 03:43.187
The partnership has to work, Felicity,

03:43.190 --> 03:45.471
because working with the SCPD

03:45.474 --> 03:47.265
and not hiding in the shadows,

03:47.267 --> 03:50.360
I truly believe

03:50.362 --> 03:52.904
that's what's best for the city.

03:52.906 --> 03:54.606
Then we can stay here,

03:54.608 --> 03:56.867
and our children can grow up safely.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.503
Well, if you believe

03:58.506 --> 04:00.871
that this is what's best for the city

04:00.873 --> 04:03.646
and what is ultimately
best for our family,

04:03.649 --> 04:05.208
then I agree.

04:05.210 --> 04:06.710
We're a team, too.

04:06.712 --> 04:09.120
Always.

04:09.122 --> 04:11.498
Except maybe we don't, you know,

04:11.500 --> 04:14.353
until the city's safe and our family is

04:14.356 --> 04:15.644
really secure,

04:15.646 --> 04:17.462
that we don't, you know, tell anybody

04:17.464 --> 04:20.482
about what's happening in here.

04:20.483 --> 04:22.175
Because I think it's too early,

04:22.177 --> 04:23.635
and I don't want
anybody crying and asking

04:23.637 --> 04:24.826
about, like, if it's a boy...

04:24.829 --> 04:26.961
- For the... for the city.
- Yeah, for the city.

04:26.964 --> 04:29.825
And for our family.

04:29.827 --> 04:31.851
It's for a better future.

04:31.853 --> 04:33.120
Yay.

04:34.824 --> 04:37.066
So about that tartine.

04:37.076 --> 04:42.129
I'm starving. I'm also nauseous.

04:53.709 --> 04:57.168
Are they all staring at you or me?

04:57.170 --> 05:00.097
Both. You reek of money,

05:00.099 --> 05:02.382
and, well, I'm undefeated.

05:02.384 --> 05:04.833
Don't wander off. Don't talk to anyone.

05:04.836 --> 05:06.168
Let me handle this.

05:06.171 --> 05:07.839
You don't even know
what we're looking for.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.557
Sure I do. It's a tape mini thingy.

05:10.559 --> 05:14.111
A microcassette player
or an answering machine,

05:14.113 --> 05:15.562
old tech from the eighties.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.954
It's the only thing that'll let us

05:16.957 --> 05:18.873
listen to the message
Felicity left for us.

05:18.876 --> 05:21.083
Right. I'm gonna talk to my contact.

05:21.086 --> 05:22.258
Look, I know these people.

05:22.261 --> 05:25.530
They're lowlifes, criminals, like me.

05:25.532 --> 05:29.885
Just stay here and don't do anything.

05:29.887 --> 05:31.220
W...

05:43.734 --> 05:47.111
Bingo.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.354
Something catch your eye?

05:51.150 --> 05:55.202
Uh, yeah. How much
for this piece of junk?

05:56.914 --> 05:59.748
Our best microcassette player.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.442
It's incredibly rare.

06:02.444 --> 06:04.778
I'll give it to you cheap.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.329
$1,000.

06:06.331 --> 06:07.600
Cheap?

06:08.747 --> 06:10.408
Look, you and I both know

06:10.410 --> 06:12.232
that no one else is interested in this.

06:12.235 --> 06:14.412
Except you, it seems.

06:14.414 --> 06:16.080
700.

06:16.082 --> 06:17.415
- 400.
- 600.

06:17.417 --> 06:20.177
500. Final offer.

06:20.179 --> 06:21.812
We have a deal.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.760
Good doing business with you.

06:34.226 --> 06:38.028
Let go. Let go. Ugh!

06:38.030 --> 06:40.285
You're making a big mistake, man.

06:40.288 --> 06:42.851
You're stupid if you think
you can come at Los Halcones.

06:42.854 --> 06:44.868
Stop talking!

06:44.870 --> 06:46.778
Him next.

06:46.780 --> 06:48.279
Hey, what the hell...

07:08.468 --> 07:12.846
15 seconds. Impressive.

07:12.848 --> 07:14.406
Let's try a leg next.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.149
Last night, 4 Los Halcones Gang members

07:30.152 --> 07:32.329
were found dead in a warehouse.

07:32.332 --> 07:35.586
Whoa. That's some "Face/Off"
level weirdness right there.

07:35.588 --> 07:36.551
Do we know what caused it?

07:36.553 --> 07:38.191
The bodies had bullet wounds,

07:38.194 --> 07:40.067
but there were no shells
found at the scene.

07:40.070 --> 07:43.426
Autopsy revealed traces of
an unidentified substance,

07:43.429 --> 07:45.838
which caused a chemical
reaction with the blood

07:45.840 --> 07:46.881
that resulted in tox...

07:46.883 --> 07:48.561
Their skin melting off.

07:48.564 --> 07:52.270
The proper term is toxic
epidermal necrolysis.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.469
- But, basically, yes.
- Yeah.

07:53.472 --> 07:54.847
Okay, how can a bullet just disappear?

07:54.849 --> 07:56.276
There have been rumors of a new weapon

07:56.278 --> 07:57.561
making its rounds on the street.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.080
Toxicology is working up labs now.

07:59.082 --> 08:01.253
We should have a better idea of
what's going on in the next few hours.

08:01.255 --> 08:03.132
Or I could just put it into
my trusty mass spectrometer

08:03.134 --> 08:04.379
and then compare it to all
the government databases

08:04.381 --> 08:07.020
that I've hacked... Um,
accidentally tapped into.

08:07.023 --> 08:07.985
It would just be so much faster.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.593
I'm sure it would,
but, um, I think we're

08:09.596 --> 08:11.909
just gonna wait to get
results when we get them.

08:11.912 --> 08:14.015
In the meantime, let's talk suspects.

08:14.018 --> 08:16.788
The Blackout Gang. Never heard of them.

08:16.791 --> 08:18.098
Right. They came onto the scene

08:18.101 --> 08:19.698
about a month or so
after you went to prison.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.372
They are some bad dudes.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.613
And with the vigilantes gone,

08:22.616 --> 08:24.946
they've been causing a lot
of trouble in The Glades.

08:24.949 --> 08:28.306
You know, that place
you guys tend to forget.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.583
Los Halcones are their main rival.

08:30.586 --> 08:32.068
So we're looking at a gang war.

08:32.071 --> 08:33.570
It seems that way.

08:33.572 --> 08:35.929
All right. I want everybody
working their contacts, okay?

08:35.932 --> 08:38.400
And I want eyes on the
hideouts for both gangs.

08:38.403 --> 08:40.403
You think maybe we should pay a visit

08:40.405 --> 08:41.602
to the Los Halcones?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.636
I don't think so. You heard Pollard.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.399
She's looking for any opportunity

08:45.402 --> 08:46.774
to disband this partnership.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.835
Got to run our leads the SCPD way.

08:54.374 --> 08:55.712
Oh, sorry.

08:55.715 --> 08:56.862
That's okay.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.955
I thought I told you to stay put.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.143
If I had, I wouldn't have found this.

09:04.146 --> 09:06.762
I know you think I'm just
some rich idiot, but I...

09:06.765 --> 09:08.587
Had it.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.798
The cassette player. It was right here.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.184
Let me guess. Little
girl bumped into you.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.010
Seemed cute, innocent.

09:15.012 --> 09:19.115
Felix... he played you.

09:19.117 --> 09:22.393
You couldn't have just
listened to me, could you?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.561
Wait.

09:24.563 --> 09:25.800
Blackstar.

09:25.803 --> 09:27.304
Screw you, Felix.

09:27.307 --> 09:29.200
You might think twice

09:29.202 --> 09:31.652
before you swing that right hook at me.

09:35.695 --> 09:40.327
One word from me, and
you'll be in SCPD custody.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.638
Ha ha!

09:41.640 --> 09:43.778
No problem, sir, right, Blackstar?

09:43.781 --> 09:45.323
We're just passing through.

09:48.462 --> 09:51.630
District Attorney Laurel Lance.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.370
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

09:54.373 --> 09:55.860
Put the prisoner through.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.403
I don't know what you
thought was gonna happen here,

10:05.405 --> 10:07.427
but you're wasting my time.

10:07.430 --> 10:09.856
There's no way that I'm...

10:14.863 --> 10:17.697
Fine. I'll be right there.

10:26.961 --> 10:29.128
Visitors aren't typically allowed entry

10:29.131 --> 10:30.463
in the cell block.

10:30.466 --> 10:32.689
Slabside doesn't say no to this D.A.

10:32.691 --> 10:36.609
So, tell me, what
exactly am I doing here?

10:45.895 --> 10:49.897
Ricardo Diaz is dead.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.066
Why hasn't this been reported yet?

10:52.068 --> 10:53.627
Well, you, of all people, know

10:53.630 --> 10:55.621
Slabside's under some major scrutiny,

10:55.624 --> 10:57.649
so they're trying to cover it up,

10:57.652 --> 11:00.574
saying he was shivved by another inmate,

11:00.577 --> 11:02.034
but that's a lie.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.333
And you know the truth.

11:03.336 --> 11:06.431
Better. I know who killed him.

11:10.877 --> 11:15.046
Oh. Oh, I get it. You have demands.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.758
Oliver made me a promise
before he left here.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.052
He said he'd get me my freedom.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.724
Where is it?

11:21.727 --> 11:22.971
We're working on it.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.571
Work faster.

11:24.574 --> 11:27.059
The terms of your
sentence are rock solid.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.103
There's a lot of red tape,

11:29.105 --> 11:30.868
especially when A.R.G.U.S. is involved.

11:30.871 --> 11:33.124
Well, then I guess we're done here.

11:37.286 --> 11:40.180
Ricardo Diaz died the
death that he deserved.

11:40.183 --> 11:42.449
I don't care who did it.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.096
Yeah, but you're still here.

11:44.099 --> 11:46.377
I told you I can't get you out of here

11:46.380 --> 11:48.539
any faster.

11:48.541 --> 11:53.511
Then I want to see my son,

11:53.513 --> 11:56.347
and not through a wall of glass.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.150
I want him here with me.

12:00.970 --> 12:04.155
Do that, and then we'll talk.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.459
One of my officers just
received word from a contact

12:16.461 --> 12:18.641
the Blackout Gang will be
convening for a weapons buy

12:18.644 --> 12:19.946
tonight in Orchid Bay.

12:19.949 --> 12:21.780
Sounds like our best chance to
get our hands on the new weapon.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.466
Take down the supplier
while we're at it.

12:23.468 --> 12:24.950
Get the unit ready to move out.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.260
- Whoa. SCPD's coming with us?
- Yeah.

12:27.263 --> 12:29.596
Look, that's really
gonna cramp our style.

12:29.599 --> 12:33.309
No. We just need to
learn to suit up together.

12:33.311 --> 12:36.343
About that. Pollard
really wants to make sure

12:36.346 --> 12:39.129
that we're treated the
same as any other officer.

12:39.132 --> 12:40.600
But we're not like any other officers.

12:40.602 --> 12:41.984
No, that's true.

12:41.986 --> 12:44.222
But for now, we still
have something to prove.

12:44.225 --> 12:48.348
And so we will be wearing, um, this...

12:48.351 --> 12:50.339
Out in the field.

12:50.342 --> 12:52.458
Pollard's taking away our threads?

12:52.461 --> 12:56.072
Look, it could be worse. She
wanted to put you in standard blues.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.775
That's also not all.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.888
We can't use our normal weapons.

13:01.891 --> 13:04.498
I know. We have to use
SCPD standard issue.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.428
We'll make it work.

13:11.141 --> 13:12.981
We got to make it work.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.364
Alpha Team's in position.

13:28.366 --> 13:30.658
No sign of the seller yet.

13:35.206 --> 13:39.208
Bravo's in position. Overwatch,
do we have eyes, please?

13:39.210 --> 13:40.840
Hold on. Pulling up thermal now.

13:40.843 --> 13:42.194
From satellite?

13:42.196 --> 13:43.789
What did I tell you about
off-the-books hacking?

13:43.791 --> 13:45.381
You said no public resources.

13:45.383 --> 13:47.216
This is private. Loophole.

13:47.218 --> 13:49.910
Yeah, looks like you got incoming.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.166
Looks like a vehicle.

13:51.169 --> 13:52.889
That's our supplier.

14:14.578 --> 14:16.411
Where's Mr. Midas?

14:16.414 --> 14:18.989
He was unable to make it,
but he sends his regards.

14:18.991 --> 14:23.068
Midas, as in the big
cheese CEO at Midas Medical?

14:23.070 --> 14:25.112
I trust you were happy with your sample.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.756
Very.

14:26.758 --> 14:29.425
We'll take as many of those
bullets as you have to sell.

14:29.427 --> 14:32.504
Start moving in. Do not engage
until the buy is complete.

14:32.507 --> 14:34.863
All 4 of us can't go in
together. We'll be spotted.

14:34.866 --> 14:36.957
We don't split up. That's protocol.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.139
On my signal.

14:38.142 --> 14:39.808
Have you seen all the blind spots?

14:39.811 --> 14:41.420
We need to maintain
the element of surprise.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.662
This isn't up for debate.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.985
Now. SCPD! Freeze!

14:49.948 --> 14:51.948
Go! Move!

14:57.771 --> 14:59.330
Let's get out of here.

15:01.317 --> 15:05.152
I'll get the supplier.
You guys take that case.

15:08.916 --> 15:12.617
Hey! Uh!

15:12.619 --> 15:15.120
They're using the poison bullets!

15:15.122 --> 15:18.474
Damn it. Fall back! All units fall back!

15:30.916 --> 15:33.310
Overwatch, the SUV's heading south.

15:33.313 --> 15:34.985
Can you track it?

15:34.988 --> 15:38.869
No, I can't, because this
dinosaur of a system just crashed.

15:47.605 --> 15:50.345
Did you not listen to
anything I said in training?

15:50.348 --> 15:52.991
Following protocol is not optional.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.253
Your protocols are flawed.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.177
That's not the problem.

15:57.180 --> 15:59.831
The problem is your refusal
to participate in our system.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.461
We don't need a lecture on how
to handle ourselves on the field.

16:02.464 --> 16:03.922
Clearly, there was a miscommunication.

16:03.924 --> 16:05.103
Is that what you'd call it?

16:05.106 --> 16:06.241
I'd call it a disaster.

16:06.244 --> 16:07.490
Okay. We just need to simmer down.

16:07.492 --> 16:09.050
Because of you, we have no evidence.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.393
Without the evidence,

16:10.395 --> 16:12.539
we'll be lucky to put
them away for a year.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.064
How we do things matters!

16:14.066 --> 16:16.867
Then you're doing things the wrong way.

16:22.232 --> 16:25.608
And you're putting this on us?

16:25.610 --> 16:28.620
Sending two teams into the field

16:28.622 --> 16:30.238
was a mistake.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.791
You should've listened to me

16:32.793 --> 16:34.959
and let us do things our way.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.911
This is our way now, Oliver.

16:36.913 --> 16:40.390
And I'm sorry. But we're all gonna
just have to get used to that.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.854
Excuse me.

16:48.305 --> 16:50.823
Oh. Sorry. Heh.

16:50.826 --> 16:52.901
So I'm sensing some tension here,

16:52.904 --> 16:55.141
but I'm just gonna cut right to it
because CSIs were able to recover

16:55.143 --> 16:57.407
the bullet that went
into the officer's armor.

16:57.409 --> 16:58.603
Thank God he was wearing that, right?

16:58.605 --> 17:01.852
I mean, nobody wears helmets anymore.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.153
Anyhoo, I ran a tox screen on it

17:04.156 --> 17:06.315
to see why it was making people
go all Wicked Witch of the West.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.459
I'm melting.

17:07.461 --> 17:08.752
I'm melting. Oh, what a world!

17:08.753 --> 17:11.237
Ahem. Hey. What'd you find?

17:11.239 --> 17:13.781
Chlormethine is a cytotoxic
agent derived from mustard gas.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.608
But that chemical weapon
was banned decades ago.

17:15.611 --> 17:16.910
Except when it's used
for medicinal purposes,

17:16.912 --> 17:17.906
like chemotherapy.

17:17.909 --> 17:20.654
Let me guess. All roads
lead back to Midas Medical.

17:20.656 --> 17:22.747
It is one of 4 labs in
Star City that still uses

17:22.750 --> 17:24.935
chlormethine as an active ingredient.

17:24.936 --> 17:27.595
And the buck stops with
this guy, James Midas.

17:27.597 --> 17:30.465
I met this guy at an SCPD fundraiser.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.468
He's got deep pockets.
It does benefit the SCPD.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.051
Okay. We got to bring him in.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.305
Not until we have proof
that he's behind this.

17:37.307 --> 17:40.191
Dinah, he got name dropped at the buy.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.860
His company produces the chemical.

17:41.862 --> 17:43.311
How much more proof do you need?

17:43.313 --> 17:45.655
The concrete kind.

17:45.657 --> 17:47.913
After what this department went
through last year with Diaz,

17:47.915 --> 17:49.484
we have all eyes on us.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.444
We just need actionable intel.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.945
Then we can get a warrant,
search his company.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.780
You get a warrant, he's
gonna know we're coming,

17:54.782 --> 17:56.282
and I know that you know that.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.090
I know that if we don't
do things the right way,

17:58.092 --> 17:59.636
then everything we've worked for

17:59.638 --> 18:02.163
since you got out of
prison will be for nothing.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.933
Is that a risk you're willing to take?

18:15.479 --> 18:18.397
Well, that could've gone better.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.064
All the training, the
rules. And now this?

18:20.066 --> 18:21.974
We are not gonna be able
to make Star City safe

18:21.977 --> 18:24.332
if we're constantly being
micromanaged by the SCPD.

18:24.335 --> 18:26.167
Well, that was our first time
out in the field all together.

18:26.169 --> 18:27.174
Maybe it'll get easier.

18:27.177 --> 18:28.523
What if it doesn't
get easier? What, then?

18:28.525 --> 18:29.666
Well, we go after Midas our way.

18:29.668 --> 18:30.896
No, you heard Dinah.

18:30.899 --> 18:34.152
We do things their way, or this
whole agreement is just gonna blow up.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.880
We just have to prove to the SCPD

18:35.883 --> 18:37.198
that our way is better,

18:37.200 --> 18:38.658
and then they will be
adapting to our side

18:38.660 --> 18:40.010
instead of the other way around.

18:40.012 --> 18:42.124
All they want to do
is bring this guy in.

18:42.127 --> 18:45.265
We deliver Midas, everybody wins.

18:46.927 --> 18:49.093
Have I told you lately
how smart you are?

18:49.095 --> 18:51.535
Well, I never get tired of hearing it.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.975
I want mint chip.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.699
Do we really expect one of these boxes

19:02.701 --> 19:05.831
to magically connect Midas
to those poison bullets?

19:05.834 --> 19:07.787
There's always a paper trail.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.163
How many more boxes are there?

19:11.166 --> 19:13.482
Monroe's about to bring
up another half-dozen

19:13.485 --> 19:14.786
from the file room.

19:14.788 --> 19:16.904
So #Readfaster.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.402
You know, Felicity was right.

19:19.405 --> 19:22.219
We should've digitized
these files years ago.

19:22.221 --> 19:25.538
Maybe Oliver was right, too.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.391
Maybe we go after
Midas the vigilante way.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.212
There is no more vigilante way, okay?

19:33.214 --> 19:35.381
There is only the SCPD way.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.258
It's my job to enforce it.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.237
Look, I get it. You're the captain,

19:40.239 --> 19:42.221
but you're also the Black Canary.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.389
I thought that came first.

19:43.391 --> 19:44.718
- It doesn't.
- Since when?

19:44.721 --> 19:48.393
Since I stuck my neck out to
make this partnership work.

19:48.396 --> 19:52.749
Vigilantes cannot operate
without SCPD sanction.

19:52.751 --> 19:54.911
The sooner all of us understand that,

19:54.914 --> 19:56.655
the better it's gonna be for all of us.

19:56.658 --> 19:58.482
Everyone's got something
at stake here, D.

19:58.485 --> 20:02.042
But if this fails, I'm
the one who loses my job.

20:02.045 --> 20:03.711
It's my ass on the line.

20:03.714 --> 20:04.949
I don't understand why this is

20:04.952 --> 20:07.788
so hard for all of you to understand.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.084
Captain Drake.

20:12.086 --> 20:17.632
Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah,
I'll be right there.

20:17.634 --> 20:20.301
That was Monroe. He
found us probable cause.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.237
I'm going to get my warrant.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.871
I just got the first quarter reports.

20:27.874 --> 20:30.645
We're already up 60% from last year.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.809
Yeah, I wanted you to hear it from me.

20:32.812 --> 20:34.353
See you tomorrow.

20:36.795 --> 20:41.947
James Midas, you have failed this city.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.659
You have some balls showing up here.

20:44.661 --> 20:45.918
You know who I am?

20:45.920 --> 20:47.637
Chlormethine.

20:47.639 --> 20:49.664
You've been weaponizing it.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.549
Now I want to hear you say it.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.924
I press one button,

20:52.927 --> 20:54.894
the whole city comes to my rescue.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.734
Yeah. Not with that circa 2017
first build security system.

21:01.737 --> 21:03.696
I don't understand why people
don't just click "update"

21:03.698 --> 21:04.933
when it says "update."

21:04.936 --> 21:06.295
Try again, James.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.974
I'm not telling you
anything. You can't touch me.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.481
Really? Come here.

21:10.484 --> 21:12.258
Stop! You'll regret this.

21:12.261 --> 21:13.521
Not as much as you.

21:13.523 --> 21:16.691
Now tell me what you
know about chlormethine.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.043
Go to hell!

21:20.029 --> 21:21.134
Wrong answer.

21:21.137 --> 21:22.848
Wait. Wait!

21:22.851 --> 21:24.391
I'll tell you everything.

21:24.394 --> 21:26.867
I did it, okay? I've been using
chlormethine to make the bullets,

21:26.869 --> 21:29.203
and then I've been selling
them to rival gangs.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.472
Good.

21:30.474 --> 21:33.165
Overwatch, you get all that?

21:33.167 --> 21:35.259
Signed, sealed, delivered.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.964
Good. James Midas, by
the authority of the SCPD,

21:37.967 --> 21:40.357
you are under arrest. Come here.

21:44.991 --> 21:47.866
Again, James, you have
my personal promise.

21:47.869 --> 21:50.725
There will be consequences
for this egregious mistake.

21:50.728 --> 21:52.683
I appreciate that, Emily.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.728
I used to have such faith in the police.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.922
I'd hate to think Star City's finest

21:56.925 --> 21:58.567
have become nothing more

21:58.569 --> 22:00.961
than a bunch of bullying thugs.

22:05.642 --> 22:07.308
So you're just cutting him loose?

22:07.311 --> 22:09.052
We have no grounds to hold him.

22:09.055 --> 22:10.412
He confessed.

22:10.414 --> 22:11.747
While you were dangling him

22:11.749 --> 22:13.547
over a vat of hydrofluoric acid.

22:13.550 --> 22:15.092
Okay, he was never in any danger.

22:15.095 --> 22:16.709
Yeah, well, that's not his story.

22:16.712 --> 22:18.086
You know, instead of using this case

22:18.088 --> 22:19.563
to work within the confines of the law,

22:19.565 --> 22:20.688
you all went rogue.

22:20.691 --> 22:23.704
And you, you let him.

22:23.707 --> 22:27.146
It's time for you to make a choice.

22:27.148 --> 22:30.032
Are you the captain
or are you a vigilante?

22:34.228 --> 22:35.987
I'm the captain.

22:35.990 --> 22:38.416
Then start acting like it.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.096
I asked you to be patient.

22:52.098 --> 22:53.146
It wasn't working.

22:53.149 --> 22:55.006
Well, it would've. I had a warrant.

22:55.009 --> 22:56.378
If you had listened to me,

22:56.381 --> 22:58.793
we could be searching
Midas's house right now

22:58.796 --> 23:01.286
instead of being told to
stay 5 miles away from him.

23:01.289 --> 23:03.232
But now we have nothing.

23:13.861 --> 23:15.578
Go on.

23:23.963 --> 23:26.822
Oh! Connor.

23:26.824 --> 23:29.157
Hi, Dad.

23:29.159 --> 23:31.051
Come here, my little hawk.

23:33.454 --> 23:36.664
I missed you so much, little man.

23:36.674 --> 23:38.483
Thank you.

23:39.962 --> 23:42.221
Go take a seat on the bed.

23:42.223 --> 23:44.690
Dad owes Ms. Lance a chat.

23:52.516 --> 23:54.307
I don't know what to say.

23:54.309 --> 23:56.016
I'm a woman of my word.

23:56.019 --> 23:59.688
And I'm a man of mine.

23:59.690 --> 24:01.857
The night Diaz died,

24:01.859 --> 24:05.244
I was serving another stint in solitary.

24:05.246 --> 24:07.487
The guard forgot to close the meal slot

24:07.489 --> 24:09.248
after delivering dinner.

24:09.250 --> 24:11.250
So when I heard yelling,

24:11.252 --> 24:14.011
I got up to get a better look.

24:14.013 --> 24:17.497
The killer walked right by my cell,

24:17.499 --> 24:19.016
wearing green leather,

24:19.018 --> 24:21.710
but it wasn't Oliver Queen.

24:21.712 --> 24:24.023
Whoever's been running around dressed up

24:24.026 --> 24:27.716
as the Green Arrow,
that's your murderer.

24:27.718 --> 24:29.944
They killed Diaz.

24:36.797 --> 24:41.207
"I'm the captain"? Really?

24:41.218 --> 24:43.093
I've know you a long time, D,

24:43.096 --> 24:44.448
and I've never seen you roll over

24:44.451 --> 24:45.784
the way you just did with Pollard.

24:45.786 --> 24:47.736
She's the mayor, Rene.

24:47.738 --> 24:49.905
And she can put an end
to this whole operation

24:49.907 --> 24:51.882
anytime she wants.

24:51.884 --> 24:53.458
That's not the point.

24:53.460 --> 24:55.270
You've been yelling at me,

24:55.273 --> 24:56.622
been yelling at Oliver,

24:56.625 --> 24:57.718
and pretty much acting weird

24:57.720 --> 24:59.402
ever since the weapons buy.

24:59.405 --> 25:03.751
So what's up, D? What's going on?

25:03.754 --> 25:07.064
At the weapons buy,
I tried to use my cry,

25:07.066 --> 25:08.899
but something went wrong.

25:08.901 --> 25:12.069
It didn't work right. It...

25:12.071 --> 25:14.218
It hurt like someone was scraping knives

25:14.221 --> 25:16.115
along the inside of my throat.

25:19.269 --> 25:21.102
I'm sorry.

25:21.104 --> 25:23.730
Being captain is the
only thing I have left.

25:23.732 --> 25:27.710
I can't be the symbol
of being on both sides,

25:27.712 --> 25:30.921
both SCPD and vigilante, because I am...

25:30.923 --> 25:35.951
I'm not the Black Canary.

25:35.953 --> 25:37.928
Not anymore.

25:37.930 --> 25:40.890
That's a bunch of crap, and you know it.

25:42.292 --> 25:44.768
Your cry doesn't make you the Canary.

25:44.770 --> 25:47.942
Did you know that the pin you gave Zoe,

25:47.945 --> 25:50.274
she wears to school every day?

25:50.276 --> 25:51.775
You think she wears that pin

25:51.777 --> 25:53.513
because of your cry? No.

25:53.516 --> 25:55.942
She looks up to you
because you're the person

25:55.945 --> 25:58.281
who will go above and
beyond to do what is right

25:58.284 --> 26:00.475
no matter the personal consequences.

26:00.477 --> 26:03.829
That's who you are no matter what.

26:06.125 --> 26:09.126
Even if that's true, it
doesn't matter anymore.

26:09.128 --> 26:10.869
Of course it does.

26:10.871 --> 26:14.948
You say you can't be the
symbol of being on both sides.

26:14.950 --> 26:17.593
That's exactly what you are.

26:23.175 --> 26:24.849
You really fixed this place up.

26:24.852 --> 26:26.334
Yeah, I thought we'd need it

26:26.336 --> 26:28.003
once the whole team got sanctioned.

26:28.005 --> 26:31.840
Oh, it's good to be
back. So good to be back.

26:31.842 --> 26:34.300
How long till we're up and running?

26:34.302 --> 26:35.986
Just a couple minutes.

26:35.988 --> 26:39.180
I can't believe that
confession got dismissed.

26:39.182 --> 26:40.706
Hey.

26:40.709 --> 26:43.810
I had a feeling I'd find you two here.

26:43.812 --> 26:47.911
So I take it you are going after Midas.

26:47.914 --> 26:49.372
He knows we're on to him,
so we need to move fast

26:49.374 --> 26:50.627
before he dumps the evidence.

26:50.630 --> 26:52.178
Right. And what about
working with the cops?

26:52.180 --> 26:53.703
Oh, you've seen what a train wreck

26:53.706 --> 26:54.751
that's been?

26:54.754 --> 26:57.081
We all know that we
operate better on our own.

26:57.084 --> 26:59.821
Now, I would like for you
to be onboard with this,

26:59.824 --> 27:01.667
but if you're not, I would just...

27:01.670 --> 27:03.496
I would ask you to stay out of our way.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.505
Oliver, I will always have your back,

27:05.508 --> 27:07.308
but you're giving up on this partnership

27:07.311 --> 27:08.927
before you're really giving it a chance,

27:08.930 --> 27:12.272
as if you're up against a
clock I don't know about.

27:13.940 --> 27:16.542
So what don't I know about?

27:21.891 --> 27:23.849
We're having a baby.

27:23.852 --> 27:26.036
Really?

27:26.038 --> 27:27.330
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:27.333 --> 27:29.337
It's a little early. We're
not telling anybody yet.

27:29.340 --> 27:32.784
That's amazing! This is wonderful!

27:32.786 --> 27:35.120
It would also explain a hell of a lot.

27:35.122 --> 27:37.715
We don't want a child
born into a city like this.

27:39.217 --> 27:41.153
Our mission is not complete.

27:41.156 --> 27:42.461
So we're going to go about this

27:42.463 --> 27:43.592
the only way that we know how,

27:43.594 --> 27:46.297
without politicians
and without a precinct.

27:46.300 --> 27:49.468
We're going to do this
the Team Arrow way.

27:49.470 --> 27:51.136
Okay, and that would work

27:51.138 --> 27:52.754
for a while.

27:52.756 --> 27:54.820
And then, uh, then I have to say,

27:54.823 --> 27:56.749
we will be right back to
where we started, Oliver,

27:56.751 --> 27:59.978
without a team, you in
prison, us on the run,

27:59.980 --> 28:03.056
and a city no closer to being
saved than where we started.

28:03.058 --> 28:04.867
Our partnership with the force

28:04.870 --> 28:06.559
is not working.

28:06.561 --> 28:08.418
Then we have to find
a way to make it work.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.939
Compromise, do whatever you have to do

28:10.941 --> 28:13.383
because if you want a new
future for this baby of yours,

28:13.386 --> 28:16.111
it won't come by doing the
same thing we used to do.

28:16.114 --> 28:18.350
We have to... we have
to be something else...

28:20.750 --> 28:22.642
Something better.

28:26.089 --> 28:27.955
You should've let me take him

28:27.958 --> 28:29.222
and the cops.

28:29.225 --> 28:31.134
I can handle a couple
of poorly-trained goons

28:31.137 --> 28:33.164
who don't know their
right from their left.

28:34.459 --> 28:36.601
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

28:36.604 --> 28:37.845
Nothing.

28:37.848 --> 28:39.134
Spit it out.

28:39.136 --> 28:40.760
I just half-expected you to shout,

28:40.762 --> 28:42.780
"Felix, you have failed this city."

28:42.782 --> 28:45.932
Well, that's a dumb thing to say.

28:45.934 --> 28:47.725
That's what our dad used to say.

28:47.727 --> 28:49.953
Oh.

28:49.955 --> 28:52.539
You reminded me of him back there.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.818
So how do you suggest we
get this cassette player

28:57.821 --> 29:00.780
if you're not gonna let me
beat the living hell out of him?

29:00.782 --> 29:03.008
I have an idea.

29:14.004 --> 29:17.314
Got it. Only cost me my next two fights.

29:17.316 --> 29:18.820
Better be worth it.

29:18.823 --> 29:20.651
Oh, this is perfect.

29:20.653 --> 29:23.228
Care to share the plan?

29:23.230 --> 29:25.957
What is the one thing the
SCPD wants more than anything

29:25.960 --> 29:27.185
in this city?

29:27.188 --> 29:29.560
- To kill vigilantes.
- Exactly.

29:29.563 --> 29:31.643
So let's hope this works.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.526
I got a Canary sighting on the
south side of the Star City bazaar,

29:38.528 --> 29:40.069
headed east.

29:40.071 --> 29:41.913
Let's go!

29:42.689 --> 29:45.082
- Heh heh.
- You're a genius.

29:45.085 --> 29:47.177
I am, like, literally.

29:51.349 --> 29:54.091
I warned you to stay away.

29:54.094 --> 29:55.894
We are not good listeners.

29:57.651 --> 29:59.764
Your friends are off chasing a Canary.

29:59.767 --> 30:02.508
Well, that's what they think anyway.

30:02.511 --> 30:04.404
You'll regret this.

30:07.057 --> 30:09.515
- Dick.
- Nice punch.

30:09.517 --> 30:11.076
Yeah.

30:14.231 --> 30:15.497
Thank you.

30:19.377 --> 30:22.620
Wow. The place looks great.

30:22.623 --> 30:24.697
Wow.

30:24.699 --> 30:26.625
Why did you guys call us here?

30:26.627 --> 30:28.691
To apologize.

30:28.694 --> 30:30.721
We shouldn't have gone off-book

30:30.724 --> 30:32.055
to go after Midas.

30:32.058 --> 30:33.724
I appreciate that.

30:33.726 --> 30:36.631
And while we're clearing the air here,

30:36.634 --> 30:39.045
I'm... I'm sorry, too.

30:39.047 --> 30:42.816
Okay? I was hard on you. I was too hard.

30:45.245 --> 30:46.795
You guys want to hug or something?

30:46.798 --> 30:48.213
Why don't we save the hugging

30:48.216 --> 30:49.907
until after we catch Midas?

30:49.909 --> 30:51.658
The second reason that
we called you here.

30:51.660 --> 30:54.435
We found a lead. Or
Felicity found a lead.

30:54.437 --> 30:56.079
In trying to find where Midas is storing

30:56.081 --> 30:58.081
his skin-melting poison,
I was able to alter

30:58.084 --> 31:00.782
my security system
algorithm to track DNA

31:00.785 --> 31:02.419
anywhere in Star City.

31:02.422 --> 31:04.179
You have Midas's DNA?

31:04.182 --> 31:06.341
Well, it turns out he's not
as squeaky clean as we thought.

31:06.343 --> 31:08.462
I got his DNA from the SCPD archive.

31:08.465 --> 31:10.134
He was arrested 15 years ago.

31:10.137 --> 31:11.836
Thank goodness the police
have record hoarders.

31:11.838 --> 31:14.305
And since he has a record
and we work for the SCPD,

31:14.308 --> 31:15.595
voilà!

31:15.598 --> 31:17.967
I interfaced with the
SCPD's surveillance system

31:17.970 --> 31:19.877
and was able to legally
monitor everywhere

31:19.879 --> 31:21.680
Midas has been in the last two weeks.

31:21.682 --> 31:23.685
Country club, office, home, and...

31:23.688 --> 31:24.927
And a warehouse registered

31:24.930 --> 31:26.850
to what is clearly a shell corporation?

31:26.853 --> 31:29.333
Obviously, he's keeping
the chemicals there.

31:29.336 --> 31:30.993
And look whose DNA is there right now.

31:30.995 --> 31:33.404
Midas is probably trying to
destroy the evidence as we speak.

31:33.407 --> 31:35.448
He can try, but he's not
gonna get away with it.

31:35.451 --> 31:36.828
We're gonna get him.

31:39.625 --> 31:42.459
We want to do things
the right way this time.

31:42.461 --> 31:45.111
That means doing a
few things differently.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.279
What did you have in mind?

31:46.281 --> 31:48.823
First things first...

31:48.825 --> 31:50.050
Suit up.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.172
I want all of this gone,

32:04.175 --> 32:06.342
not a single drop left behind.

32:06.344 --> 32:08.227
Overwatch to Team Arrow.

32:08.229 --> 32:09.899
I have confirmation on Midas

32:09.902 --> 32:11.864
and a crapload of gun-toting goons.

32:13.078 --> 32:14.221
What about the chemicals?

32:14.224 --> 32:16.242
Being loaded into the back of a truck.

32:16.245 --> 32:18.186
Dinah, what's your status?

32:18.189 --> 32:19.525
Almost in position.

32:19.528 --> 32:21.357
Take it to the reservoir.

32:21.359 --> 32:24.335
Anyone tries to stop you...
I don't care who it is...

32:24.337 --> 32:25.795
Kill them.

32:27.380 --> 32:30.101
Guys, you may want to speed things
up. They're about to move out.

32:30.104 --> 32:31.407
If those chemicals reach the reservoir,

32:31.409 --> 32:32.850
everyone in Star City will be at risk.

32:32.852 --> 32:34.661
We can't let that truck leave.

32:34.663 --> 32:36.914
No, we won't.

32:36.916 --> 32:39.392
Hyah! Hyah...

32:43.315 --> 32:45.690
You have the right to remain silent.

32:45.692 --> 32:46.899
Now!

33:01.918 --> 33:03.802
Get me out of here,

33:03.805 --> 33:05.488
and I'll double your salaries.

33:13.244 --> 33:14.381
Bad news, guys.

33:14.384 --> 33:17.794
Midas is about two minutes
away from being a free man.

33:17.797 --> 33:19.863
Got go stop him.

33:19.866 --> 33:21.800
You go. I'll secure the evidence.

33:44.275 --> 33:46.608
We're taking heavy fire! We're cornered!

33:58.598 --> 34:00.840
Man, I really missed our toys.

34:02.176 --> 34:04.602
The chemicals are secure. Where's Midas?

34:15.097 --> 34:16.947
James Midas,

34:16.949 --> 34:19.130
you are under arrest.

34:19.132 --> 34:20.952
Not tonight.

34:20.954 --> 34:23.788
You think this is gonna work
out better than last time?

34:23.790 --> 34:28.859
Because now I'll have your
badge and your costume.

34:30.272 --> 34:31.871
Uh!

34:31.873 --> 34:33.822
I don't think so.

34:33.824 --> 34:36.708
Thanks to all those
chemicals we just confiscated,

34:36.710 --> 34:39.879
you're going away for a long time.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.139
Like I said...

34:43.643 --> 34:46.143
You're under arrest.

34:56.632 --> 34:59.516
James Midas is in SCPD lockup.

34:59.518 --> 35:01.067
We got what we need to put him away

35:01.069 --> 35:02.685
for a very long time.

35:02.687 --> 35:04.687
Thank you for doing it the legal way.

35:04.689 --> 35:06.481
Thank you for letting us do it our way.

35:06.483 --> 35:07.982
And for joining us.

35:07.984 --> 35:09.242
We missed you, Canary.

35:09.244 --> 35:11.027
I missed her, too.

35:11.029 --> 35:12.820
Thank you for reminding me of that.

35:12.822 --> 35:14.154
Wait. Why do I get the feeling

35:14.156 --> 35:16.397
the Canary flight was a
one-night-only kind of thing?

35:16.400 --> 35:21.416
I'll be back in the field,
just, uh, without my cry.

35:23.309 --> 35:26.308
When my nerve was ruptured,
it created lasting damage.

35:26.311 --> 35:29.306
I'm... I'm sorry, Dinah.

35:29.309 --> 35:32.594
Well, Dinah, cry or no cry,
you are the Black Canary.

35:32.597 --> 35:34.657
You proved that tonight.

35:34.660 --> 35:36.937
Thank you.

35:36.939 --> 35:38.551
You know what else we did tonight?

35:38.554 --> 35:40.723
We forced Pollard's hand.

35:40.725 --> 35:43.017
I leveraged her relationship with Midas

35:43.019 --> 35:44.945
to convince her to sign off on creating

35:44.947 --> 35:47.045
a special vigilante task force.

35:47.048 --> 35:49.473
We're still sanctioned by the SCPD,

35:49.476 --> 35:51.309
but we're operating as our own unit

35:51.312 --> 35:54.195
out of the bunker in our suits.

35:54.197 --> 35:55.982
And the anti-vigilante law?

35:55.985 --> 35:58.922
It's on her desk for
repeal. She's gonna sign it.

35:58.925 --> 36:01.740
So we're like the Black
Ops for the SCPD now?

36:01.743 --> 36:02.838
That's cool.

36:02.841 --> 36:04.350
I'm just glad we're all back.

36:04.353 --> 36:05.518
It feels right.

36:05.521 --> 36:06.541
I'll second that.

36:06.543 --> 36:08.334
It's nice to be part of a team again.

36:08.336 --> 36:10.303
And be here at the bunker...

36:10.305 --> 36:12.064
The sweet bunker.

36:12.066 --> 36:14.915
Do you guys feel like hitting
up the, uh, "sweet" bar?

36:14.918 --> 36:16.085
You guys go ahead.

36:16.088 --> 36:17.644
I ate something that's not
gonna mix well with alcohol.

36:17.646 --> 36:20.239
Yeah. I'm gonna hang back, too, guys.

36:20.241 --> 36:21.632
Okay.

36:26.771 --> 36:29.990
I got you something.

36:29.992 --> 36:32.066
Gee, you shouldn't have.

36:32.068 --> 36:34.235
Well, it was the only
thing that Lyla said

36:34.237 --> 36:35.737
helped her with her nausea.

36:35.739 --> 36:37.280
They're ginger candy chews.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.441
Oh, God. I'll try anything.

36:39.444 --> 36:41.649
Morning sickness or not, Felicity,

36:41.652 --> 36:43.670
you have not missed a beat.

36:43.672 --> 36:46.076
You were absolutely
amazing out there today.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.432
Your tech was phenomenal.

36:47.434 --> 36:49.989
Well, Curtis would've had 5
ideas to make it better, but...

36:49.992 --> 36:51.103
Well, maybe...

36:51.105 --> 36:52.587
But if Curtis was still at A.R.G.U.S.,

36:52.589 --> 36:53.921
I would've asked him to buy your tech.

36:53.923 --> 36:55.279
And I'm sure A.R.G.U.S. wouldn't be

36:55.281 --> 36:58.350
the only corporation hunting for it.

36:58.353 --> 37:00.720
And I think that's more
than a security system

37:00.722 --> 37:02.472
you're working on.

37:02.474 --> 37:05.075
I think you're on to something big.

37:18.656 --> 37:20.631
Thank you for coming in.

37:20.634 --> 37:23.468
I'm Laurel Lance, District Attorney.

37:23.470 --> 37:25.495
I know who you are.

37:25.497 --> 37:28.048
And I know who you are, too.

37:28.050 --> 37:30.809
Emiko Adachi.

37:30.811 --> 37:32.757
Your mother was killed a year ago.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.709
Your father is Robert Queen.

37:34.712 --> 37:37.171
And for the last 7 months,

37:37.174 --> 37:39.650
you've been running around the city

37:39.653 --> 37:41.255
dressed like your brother.

37:41.258 --> 37:43.537
And you've also managed
to endear yourself

37:43.540 --> 37:45.181
to Oliver and his team.

37:45.183 --> 37:47.141
I also know that you were at Slabside

37:47.143 --> 37:49.185
the night that Ricardo
Diaz burned to death.

37:49.187 --> 37:51.237
What's your point?

37:51.239 --> 37:53.907
That you're lying about
who you really are.

37:53.909 --> 37:55.834
You're not a hero.

37:55.836 --> 37:58.361
And I wonder how Oliver
and his team will feel

37:58.363 --> 38:00.530
when they find out that
their new vigilante friend

38:00.532 --> 38:03.917
murdered Diaz in cold blood.

38:03.919 --> 38:06.202
I'm guessing family dinners are gonna be

38:06.204 --> 38:07.679
a little bit more awkward.

38:07.681 --> 38:11.091
And, uh, what makes you think

38:11.093 --> 38:15.044
they will believe a word you say,

38:15.046 --> 38:17.481
Black Siren?

38:25.531 --> 38:28.682
Do you think I'm showing,
just even a little?

38:28.692 --> 38:31.627
I think you look exactly the same.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.453
How you feeling?

38:35.456 --> 38:37.149
Oh, I feel like I
could sleep for 2 weeks.

38:37.152 --> 38:39.452
Oh, yeah.

38:39.454 --> 38:43.364
Hey, so in between
updating the SCPD's tech

38:43.366 --> 38:45.366
and taking down evil CEOs,

38:45.368 --> 38:48.369
I was brainstorming baby names today.

38:48.371 --> 38:49.537
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:49.539 --> 38:51.056
Any frontrunners?

38:51.058 --> 38:54.134
For a boy, I've always liked Lucas.

38:54.136 --> 38:56.919
Yeah. Lucas.

38:56.921 --> 38:59.139
That's good.

38:59.141 --> 39:03.202
I may have thought of a name for a girl.

39:03.205 --> 39:04.471
Yeah?

39:07.573 --> 39:09.073
Mia.

39:09.076 --> 39:11.034
Short for Moira.

39:12.512 --> 39:15.221
Sweet and fiery.

39:16.775 --> 39:18.274
I love it.

39:18.276 --> 39:20.660
And regardless of whether we have

39:20.662 --> 39:22.849
a boy or a girl...

39:24.113 --> 39:25.782
I just want to make sure that...

39:25.784 --> 39:29.619
she or he end up...

39:29.621 --> 39:32.262
growing up in a better
and safer Star City

39:32.265 --> 39:33.456
than I did.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.933
Yeah.

39:34.935 --> 39:37.335
I want that for both of our children.

39:40.632 --> 39:42.965
They'll always have
each other to lean on.

39:42.967 --> 39:44.943
And we'll always have us.

39:49.402 --> 39:51.235
What are you waiting for?

39:51.238 --> 39:53.136
Let's play the damn thing.

39:53.139 --> 39:54.880
I don't know. What are you waiting for?

39:54.883 --> 39:56.580
Fine.

40:00.488 --> 40:01.913
Maybe I should do it.

40:01.916 --> 40:03.147
It's not as easy as it look...

40:03.150 --> 40:04.750
Just give it to me.

40:09.739 --> 40:12.257
This is some, like,
feelings thing, isn't it?

40:12.260 --> 40:14.664
Well, I haven't heard Felicity's voice

40:14.666 --> 40:18.501
in almost two decades, so, yeah, it is.

40:18.503 --> 40:21.395
Look, whatever she says on there,

40:21.398 --> 40:24.390
it's clear she wanted
both of us to hear it...

40:24.392 --> 40:26.401
Together.

40:29.037 --> 40:31.763
All right. Let's just
get this over with.

40:34.703 --> 40:36.563
William and Mia,

40:36.566 --> 40:38.038
you know, this is the first time

40:38.040 --> 40:39.956
I've ever said your names together?

40:39.959 --> 40:42.908
20 years, and I avoid ever saying
your names in the same sentence.

40:42.911 --> 40:46.043
It feels like the work of a
paranoid, overprotective mother.

40:46.046 --> 40:47.921
I guess we really do
turn into our parents.

40:47.924 --> 40:49.415
I'm rambling. Sorry.

40:49.417 --> 40:50.896
Not just for the rambling.

40:50.899 --> 40:54.661
For everything, but mostly for
keeping the two of you apart.

40:54.664 --> 40:57.257
I'm not asking for your forgiveness,

40:57.259 --> 41:00.501
but just know that your father
and I did it to protect you.

41:00.503 --> 41:02.459
We did it because we love you.

41:02.462 --> 41:04.203
Now that you've found each other,

41:04.206 --> 41:06.265
I just have one request.

41:06.268 --> 41:08.693
Give these coordinates to the team:

41:08.695 --> 41:14.244
47.6119 North, 122.3301 West.

41:14.247 --> 41:16.431
And then get the hell out of Star City.

41:16.434 --> 41:19.601
And whatever you do,
don't come looking for me.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.542
So we're ignoring her.

41:25.545 --> 41:27.169
Definitely.

41:30.033 --> 41:32.217
I know where these lead.

41:35.747 --> 41:38.306
That's where.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.047
We're going over the wall...

41:46.049 --> 41:47.732
to The Glades.
