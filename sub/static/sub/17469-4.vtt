00:10.243 --> 00:12.553
It is magical, though, isn't it?

00:12.712 --> 00:15.454
That something so large can stay aloft?

00:15.615 --> 00:17.219
It's not magic, it's physics.

00:17.384 --> 00:18.419
Thrust, drag, lift.

00:19.085 --> 00:20.655
I gotta make a phone call.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.323
I thought we agreed
to set aside work for the day.

00:23.490 --> 00:25.697
You suggested it.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.736
I remained silent.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:37.871 --> 00:39.646
<i>Don't tell me they canceled your trip.</i>

00:39.806 --> 00:41.581
The first direct flight
from New York to London?

00:41.741 --> 00:43.550
Pan Am wouldn't cancel this
for the Second Coming.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.589
- So you're checking <i>up on</i> me?
- Damn right. How's my magazine?

00:46.746 --> 00:49.522
Well, Back of the Book's
given me shit-all.

00:49.682 --> 00:53.357
Front copy's more white than black,
and I'm waiting for a photo dump...

00:53.520 --> 00:55.158
<i>...from Stockton. Typical Saturday.</i>

00:55.321 --> 00:57.460
- Where's Art stand on the cover?
- Almost there.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.570
I, um...

00:59.926 --> 01:01.906
I have some lingering concerns.

01:02.529 --> 01:07.103
- About the cover art or about my story?
- Your story is a smear piece.

01:07.267 --> 01:10.043
Five hundred Vietnamese civilians
were murdered, unprovoked.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.546
<i>That warrants smearing.</i>

01:11.704 --> 01:14.048
We do not have confirmation
from the military.

01:14.207 --> 01:17.051
My source has seen
the Army's preliminary report.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.486
Look, in a matter of weeks
this is public record.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.149
<i>Let's wait ti“ then.
I want to know we're right...</i>

01:22.315 --> 01:24.659
<i>...before we start tarnishing
these men's careers.</i>

01:24.818 --> 01:28.061
<i>We got Cafley, Mitchell, Bernhardt.</i>

01:28.221 --> 01:30.098
<i>Jesus, Bernhardfs 23 years old.</i>

01:30.256 --> 01:33.100
- I don't care if he's in diapers.
- Finn.

01:34.961 --> 01:37.703
We've been scooped on Songmy
before because you preached caution.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.339
<i>If you need substantiation
to sleep at night...</i>

01:40.500 --> 01:44.141
...get General Peers on the phone,
then run my fucking story.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.607
Okay, Chief.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.481
<i>When the galley's locked,
wire it to London.</i>

01:49.642 --> 01:51.986
I'll head to the bureau
as soon as we touch down.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.349
Motherfucker. Angie.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.394
Get General William Peers,
U.S. Army, on the phone.

01:59.552 --> 02:02.897
Tell him I need a confirmation
of a story before we go to press tonight.

02:04.023 --> 02:06.264
Finn's centerpiece on Songmy?

02:06.526 --> 02:07.937
Yes.

02:08.094 --> 02:09.630
<i>Know what gets me? The arrogance.</i>

02:09.795 --> 02:12.504
We can disagree.
It's not as if I'm above discourse.

02:12.665 --> 02:16.704
He doesn't like it when I dust off
my press pass and write about Vietnam.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.144
He's a hawk.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.339
A military apologist.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.681
Here you go.

02:30.950 --> 02:34.830
I read that there's a lounge
in the upper deck with a full bar.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.299
Fire off this Editor's Page on the flight,
wire it home when we land.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.995
Hopefully sneak it
into this week's issue.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.055
Where do you wanna start?

04:07.213 --> 04:10.626
I don't know. Cindy, I am so excited.

04:10.783 --> 04:13.787
If we talk to two girls a day,
we can have the entire magazine...

04:13.953 --> 04:16.024
...in a couple of weeks.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.533
Oh, what about Vivian?

04:18.690 --> 04:19.761
Um...

04:19.926 --> 04:22.736
She calls me Cindy Lou Who.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.101
In a rude way.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.711
We're gonna have to talk to a lot of girls.
That means even the rude ones.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.409
Why don't you talk to Dottie in Theater?

04:32.305 --> 04:33.750
I don't really know Dottie.

04:34.407 --> 04:35.477
She's on your yes list.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.923
Because she is always complaining,
not because we're friends.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.115
I can't do all the recruitment on my own.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.654
Oh, I know.

04:42.815 --> 04:43.919
I know.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.892
Oh, I'll talk to Beverly.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.793
That'll give us half of Foreign.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.068
I think she's making it with her reporter.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.465
Well, maybe, but she gave me
her tuna crunch casserole once...

04:54.627 --> 04:55.765
...and it was delicious.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.032
Mm.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.876
What about Jane?

05:00.033 --> 05:02.035
You know, a lot of the girls
look up to her.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.040
I talked to Jane.

05:06.205 --> 05:07.411
I don't think she's ready.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.118
Oh...

05:09.275 --> 05:12.347
All right, well, I will focus on Beverly.

05:17.617 --> 05:18.618
Cindy, what is that?

05:21.254 --> 05:22.824
Oh, it's--

05:23.890 --> 05:27.531
They were handing them out
at the last consciousness-raising...

05:27.694 --> 05:32.905
...and it is about giving
and receiving pleasure.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.545
My little girl is all grown up.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.675
I can't read more
than a paragraph at a time...

05:37.837 --> 05:39.475
...because it makes me blush.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.849
It's happening now, isn't it?

05:45.044 --> 05:46.148
Damn it.

06:10.336 --> 06:12.543
- Those my profiles?
- Eldridge Cleaver...

06:12.705 --> 06:15.015
...David Hilliard, Angela Davis.

06:15.174 --> 06:16.744
Nice suit. Who died?

06:16.909 --> 06:19.753
Oh, James P. Kelly, 63rd precinct.

06:19.912 --> 06:23.553
PD got into a gunfight with a group
of Black Panthers in Midwood.

06:23.716 --> 06:27.095
- One of the officers died.
- Oh, boy.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.001
You have something. What is it?

06:39.165 --> 06:40.667
Do you know anyone in Vietnam?

06:41.267 --> 06:45.010
- I could find a list of active servicemen.
- No, personally. Do you know any vets?

06:45.738 --> 06:48.446
The boys I grew up with
went to college to avoid the war.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.645
- Did Finn sign off on a story?
- Sort of.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.620
On his way out last night,
he came over, tapped on my desk...

06:53.780 --> 06:55.555
...and said,
"When Our Boys Come Home."

06:55.715 --> 06:57.388
And then he walked out the door.

06:57.550 --> 06:58.756
"When our boys come home"?

06:58.918 --> 07:01.626
- How is that an investigative piece?
- I have no idea.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.261
When were you gonna tell me
you had a boyfriend?

07:04.424 --> 07:05.425
What?

07:05.892 --> 07:08.236
Townley Investments? Chad, is it?

07:09.328 --> 07:10.705
Who told you?

07:10.863 --> 07:11.864
Not you.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.070
Four Panthers were killed too.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.511
They don't mention that
till the last paragraph.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.981
It's articles like this
that give them a bad name.

07:21.140 --> 07:24.952
I think it's dead policemen
that give the Panthers a bad name.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.591
Are you writing
a pro-law enforcement article now?

07:28.080 --> 07:31.789
- Patti, I'm not gonna argue with you.
- I'm not arguing. I'm just asking.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.794
I'm not writing a pro-anything article.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.524
There's violence on both sides.
I'm not gonna ignore it.

07:39.358 --> 07:41.770
So, what time is the funeral?

07:41.928 --> 07:43.839
Tonight at 6, near Prospect.

07:43.996 --> 07:45.942
Rhodes, you're going
to a funeral tonight?

07:47.500 --> 07:48.672
Yeah.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.212
You need something to do?

07:50.670 --> 07:52.149
We publish on a Saturday.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.410
You planning on bringing a typewriter
to the funeral parlor?

07:54.574 --> 07:57.145
We're not publishing tonight.
Finn gave us leeway on the deadline.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.448
- Leeway?
- I'm sorry...

07:58.611 --> 08:00.113
...that sounds like
an investigative piece.

08:00.279 --> 08:02.122
Really?
Doug, does that sound...

08:02.281 --> 08:03.453
...like an investigative piece to you?

08:03.616 --> 08:07.029
You know, I hadn't thought of it, Patti,
but it kind of does.

08:07.353 --> 08:08.661
But that's Sam's assignment.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.733
Right.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.233
How's that coming along?

08:13.025 --> 08:14.663
An ongoing story is a privilege.

08:14.827 --> 08:18.639
It's not something that you back into
when you can't close on deadline.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.277
Reporters.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.504
In my office.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.957
We may need an alternative
from the feature well...

08:34.113 --> 08:36.150
...in the next few hours.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.085
I thought the Peers report
was our centerpiece.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.691
It was, but that story might not make it.

08:40.852 --> 08:45.666
So I wanna go around here
and see which story you might have...

08:45.825 --> 08:46.929
...that we can slot in.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.573
Why would Finn ix-nay his own story?

08:51.097 --> 08:53.168
Nobody is ix-naying anything.

08:53.332 --> 08:56.370
I'm preparing a contingency
in case this story unravels...

08:56.536 --> 08:57.742
...at the eleventh hour.

08:57.904 --> 09:01.545
Does Finn know
that you're preparing a contingency?

09:01.707 --> 09:03.186
He's on an airplane.

09:03.342 --> 09:06.186
I am in charge.
And I'm gonna make damn sure...

09:06.345 --> 09:10.452
...that this magazine lives up
to its sterling reputation.

09:11.584 --> 09:14.190
- Who's got something?
- You think somebody's fired?

09:14.353 --> 09:16.697
If Wick was letting a reporter go,
he wouldn't call them all in.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.063
- Unless they're all fired.
- Don't be ridiculous.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.761
That happened at The Register.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.066
They fired everyone but the typesetter
and the guy on Obits.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.402
But they hired them all back
the next day.

09:25.598 --> 09:28.078
Angie, what's going on up there?

09:28.234 --> 09:30.373
All hands on deck.
I'm sure your reporters will fill you in.

09:30.536 --> 09:31.708
Angie.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.553
Wick is working on a backup
for the Songmy story.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.622
He wants everything
Ned has from the week.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.691
Why? Finn's story was brilliant.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.026
Wick doesn't think it'll hold water.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.494
I know. But once Finn lands,
this will all get sorted out.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.828
Looks like for now it's double duty.

09:53.292 --> 09:54.930
Thank you, gentlemen.

10:00.132 --> 10:01.975
Captions?

10:02.134 --> 10:03.204
This is scandalous.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.905
Captions are Cindy Reston's job.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.744
Wick needs more than she can handle.

10:06.906 --> 10:10.046
You don't take the magazine's
star reporter and assign him captions.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.314
Which is why I need you to do it.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.786
Wick's letting Doug follow
his investigative track...

10:14.947 --> 10:16.949
...while Adam and Ralph
prep their features.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.120
That's generous.
Doug hasn't had a cover in months.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.358
Yeah, it means I really need
to get my vets piece up and running.

10:23.522 --> 10:25.798
Okay. Well, I'll call the VA...

10:25.958 --> 10:28.029
...and I'll have something set up
with their press office.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.936
Actually, I'm gonna work
with Naomi on this one.

10:31.697 --> 10:32.698
Ralph's Naomi?

10:32.865 --> 10:35.402
She's got a husband in Da Nang.
She might have insight.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.570
And you don't know
anyone in Vietnam, right?

10:37.737 --> 10:39.341
- But I could--
- Hey, captions.

10:55.955 --> 10:58.265
We set off on a...

11:00.493 --> 11:05.101
Terry, what's a $5 word
for trip or journey?

11:05.264 --> 11:07.710
- Uh, traverse?
- A noun, not a verb.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.473
Like, "We set out on a..." On a what?

11:11.103 --> 11:12.104
How about a sojourn?

11:12.972 --> 11:15.145
- Too sanctimonious.
- Odyssey.

11:17.376 --> 11:18.821
Venture.

11:19.245 --> 11:22.249
Pilgrimage, peregrination.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.895
Although peregrination
is a $10 word.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.621
What's going on with you?

11:28.487 --> 11:30.899
I don't know why I imagined
this would be different.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.833
What would be different?

11:35.494 --> 11:36.666
You said vacation.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.532
- That's what you said.
- Talia--

11:38.698 --> 11:41.702
They give the magazine these tickets
in exchange for a story.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.643
That's how quid pro quo works.

11:46.138 --> 11:49.745
And thank you.
"Pilgrimage" was the word.

11:56.148 --> 11:58.856
This is not what I told you to write.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.258
This is exactly
what you told me to write.

12:00.419 --> 12:02.695
If it's what I told you,
I didn't mean it. Go, go.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.232
Come on.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.432
- Vivian, hi.
- Yes?

12:08.594 --> 12:11.302
Your article
on the Milan Bank Bombing.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.876
- I really dug it.
- Swell. Thanks. But I just got--

12:14.033 --> 12:17.276
"It's as if Jupiter himself
cast his thunderous judgment...

12:17.436 --> 12:19.643
...upon the Piazza Fontana."

12:19.805 --> 12:22.081
Just guessing that JP didn't write that.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.584
The man's a bonobo.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.651
Sometimes he writes,
"Insert metaphor here" in his copy.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.817
- I'd like to insert a metaphor somewhere.
- Wow.

12:30.983 --> 12:33.987
Listen, some of the girls and I
are getting together after work.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.689
Just to blow off some steam.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.495
It's at that place on Madison,
the Women's Commerce Shop?

12:38.657 --> 12:41.501
- That little craft store?
- Yeah, they have good sandwiches.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.038
The guys never go,
so it's a good place to talk...

12:44.196 --> 12:47.871
...if you like sandwiches
and you want to get away from JP.

12:48.367 --> 12:49.539
Sure.

12:49.702 --> 12:50.840
Hey, Vivian.

12:51.370 --> 12:52.576
Um...

12:52.738 --> 12:54.411
Don't mention this to anyone, okay?

13:00.913 --> 13:02.392
You have to imagine I'm looking
at a bunch of people...

13:02.548 --> 13:04.585
...with sweaty chests.
All I see are sweaty chests.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.354
And in front of me is Willie Reed.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.398
So he's just talking.
He's jawing with his buddies...

13:09.555 --> 13:11.193
...and what I didn't realize...

13:11.357 --> 13:13.496
...is that his girlfriend
was right behind me.

13:13.659 --> 13:15.161
- Uh-huh.
- So his eyes light up.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.732
He puts out his arms,
and I just-- I go right in.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.605
You did not hug Willis Reed.

13:20.766 --> 13:24.043
I did.
I completely misread the situation.

13:24.203 --> 13:26.979
Okay, you need to tell me
what does Willis Reed smell like.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.641
Who's Willis Reed?

13:30.609 --> 13:32.486
Uh, a three-time All-Star.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.484
- The center for the Knicks.
- Oh.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.219
And how does he relate
to "When Our Boys Come Home"?

13:39.552 --> 13:41.691
Well, we sort of hit
a standstill on the story.

13:41.921 --> 13:42.991
A standstill.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.894
My husband won't be back
for eight months.

13:46.058 --> 13:48.299
Glad to see you're not
too broken up about it.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.497
Would you like me to call the VA now?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.507
No. I don't want anyone
hand-picked by the military.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.804
<i>Okay-</i>

13:54.967 --> 13:57.379
- Could you review my captions?
- Sure. I'll swing by in a minute.

13:57.536 --> 13:59.982
I'm meeting my mother
for lunch in 20 minutes.

14:00.139 --> 14:03.143
Well, then, clearly we need
to expedite these captions.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.587
Okay. Let me see where you stand.

14:08.547 --> 14:09.924
Thank you.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.417
Thanks for your help.

14:13.652 --> 14:14.892
He's frustrated.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.055
That's all.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.725
Finn rejected all of his proposals
for the investigative piece...

14:18.891 --> 14:20.802
...and then gave him
a nothing assignment.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.798
I mean, "When Our Boys Come Home"?

14:23.963 --> 14:26.409
That's an idea. It's not a story.

14:27.132 --> 14:29.772
We don't know any
Vietnam veterans, do we?

14:30.569 --> 14:32.480
I wish your father
had gotten you a job...

14:32.638 --> 14:35.118
...at a less Jewish magazine.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.449
I know you find the newsroom dynamic.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.887
Mommy, none of the editors
at News of the Week are Jewish...

14:41.046 --> 14:43.117
...and only a few of the reporters are.

14:43.282 --> 14:44.625
Yours is.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.225
Anyway...

14:52.892 --> 14:53.962
I stopped by the pharmacy...

14:54.126 --> 14:56.970
...and Dr. Simpson gave me
an extra prescription of Obetrol.

14:57.763 --> 15:00.369
He says it is better
than your Aminorex, stronger.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.677
You take a pill
a half hour before meals...

15:03.836 --> 15:06.373
...and it'll curb your appetite. Heh.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.915
You know, I'm really sorry.
I have to run.

15:12.444 --> 15:15.482
It's deadline day,
and I should get back to the office.

15:15.714 --> 15:17.887
Thank you for lunch, Mommy.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.424
Give Daddy my best.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.327
Cindy. Hi.

15:56.488 --> 15:57.796
Do you need something?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.698
Yeah, l...

16:00.559 --> 16:03.768
<i>Have you read the new
Ladies' Home Journal?</i>

16:03.929 --> 16:06.967
There's a terrific
Chicken é Ia King recipe.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.133
Chicken é Ia King?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.576
Beverly, you will never guess
what the secret is.

16:10.736 --> 16:12.010
Pimento peppers.

16:12.171 --> 16:14.742
It's the same thing
that they stuff in olives.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.251
<i>- I'll</i> check it out.
- I can bring it in for you.

16:17.409 --> 16:19.389
To tell the truth,
I'm swamped right now.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.957
I've got Dennis's regular columns
plus the captions.

16:22.114 --> 16:25.118
I think it's unfair that the boys here
get all the credit...

16:25.284 --> 16:27.321
...even though the girls do lots of work.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.167
Well, they write the articles.

16:31.757 --> 16:34.465
Yeah, I know, I know, but...

16:34.927 --> 16:36.929
Sometimes I think
that we could probably...

16:37.096 --> 16:39.042
...write them just as well.

16:39.198 --> 16:44.272
You know, I've seen some of your files,
and they are as good as the final copy.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.313
Why are you looking at my files?

16:47.072 --> 16:48.244
Huh?

16:48.407 --> 16:49.943
Oh, I don't--

16:50.109 --> 16:54.387
I don't remember what I saw
or why I saw it.

16:54.546 --> 16:57.049
I was just trying
to give you a compliment.

16:57.216 --> 17:00.322
I think that you are good at your job.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.795
Thanks.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.731
Any time.

17:18.737 --> 17:19.909
Will you hold this?

17:20.071 --> 17:21.813
Get my wallet out.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.718
We're heading first
to my office in Mayfair...

17:24.877 --> 17:27.380
...where you'll wait,
then off to the Hyde Park Hotel.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.924
- Will that be enough?
- Hell, this'll get you to Milton Keynes...

17:30.082 --> 17:31.083
-...and back.
- Good.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.457
Finn, I would like to go
directly to the hotel.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.394
A quick stop at the bureau,
say some hellos, proof the galley.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.797
- I would like to go directly to the hotel.
- Alistair wants to see you.

17:38.957 --> 17:41.369
He always asks about you and the girls.
We're heading straight to Mayfair.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.234
He asks about us to be polite, Finn.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.837
- Talia--
- Alistair is a colleague.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.706
And just because he has
good manners doesn't mean...

17:48.867 --> 17:51.177
...I want to sit in an office
for hours making small talk.

17:51.336 --> 17:53.942
- I never said hours.
- Don't.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.486
Well, we're all loaded up then?

17:57.643 --> 17:59.714
Can you give us a minute, please?

18:01.246 --> 18:03.385
I'll run in, drop off the story, run out.
Five minutes.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.752
Five becomes 10, 10 becomes 20.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.730
Okay, enough with the histrionics.
Jesus Christ.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.299
Now I see.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.068
You see what?

18:20.599 --> 18:21.839
Why Rebecca left you.

18:35.414 --> 18:37.758
Do you wanna resolve this here?

18:37.916 --> 18:39.520
In the rain?

18:39.952 --> 18:42.990
On the sidewalk of
Heathrow fucking Airport?

18:45.824 --> 18:47.098
Get in the cab.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.601
Talia, please get in the cab.

19:09.448 --> 19:10.927
Talia.

19:12.618 --> 19:13.619
Honey, look at me.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.593
I have hundreds of employees...

19:18.757 --> 19:20.862
...in dozens of cities
across five continents.

19:21.026 --> 19:24.405
- We never know when the news--
- I know the speech.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.407
"The news never stops."

19:27.566 --> 19:29.239
I know it.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.514
I'm not going to quit.

19:36.608 --> 19:40.112
You only hear two things.
Work hard or don't work at all.

19:40.279 --> 19:42.122
But it's not binary.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.693
I will never ask you to quit.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.852
Then what do you want?

19:48.554 --> 19:53.196
That when you're here,
you're here with me.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.432
That's all.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.303
That's all I want.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.187
Change of plans.
We're going to Knightsbridge.

20:16.348 --> 20:17.725
Right.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.686
It's so dry in here.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.258
Thirsty.

21:04.396 --> 21:05.704
Dottie, hi.

21:05.964 --> 21:06.965
Hi, Patti.

21:07.132 --> 21:09.476
I read your article
on The Great White <i>Hope.</i>

21:09.635 --> 21:11.012
I really dug it.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.834
Your high school yearbook.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.632
Morris High, class of '59.

21:41.199 --> 21:42.200
And?

21:42.367 --> 21:45.246
Just because I don't know any veterans
doesn't mean you don't.

21:46.204 --> 21:48.115
I went down to the morgue,
pulled your yearbook...

21:48.273 --> 21:49.877
...and compared it
with the Army registry.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.988
And I got 11 hits.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.785
Clifford Rifkind, Stanley Sacks,
Benjamin Hammer--

21:55.947 --> 21:57.654
Me and Bennie
had homeroom together.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.954
He got shot down over Phuoc Vihn.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.026
So your interview subject is...

22:05.190 --> 22:06.430
...Noah Benowytz.

22:06.758 --> 22:07.998
Jesus.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.161
Noah.

22:10.295 --> 22:11.330
He went to Nam?

22:11.496 --> 22:14.477
Two tours, but he's back now.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.971
For a while there, we were like this:

22:18.136 --> 22:19.274
How'd you know?

22:19.438 --> 22:20.974
It's my job.

22:23.709 --> 22:24.915
Heh.

22:25.544 --> 22:29.822
And you're set to meet him downtown
in 30 minutes, so you'd better hurry.

22:30.048 --> 22:31.152
Jane.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.257
Nice work.

22:34.252 --> 22:36.254
As long as I'm here,
I'm here for you.

22:38.457 --> 22:39.834
Then come with me.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.335
Unless you'd rather be doing captions.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.084
Hey, are you taking off? It's still early.

22:54.239 --> 22:57.743
If we hurry, we can swing by your place
before we head to Brooklyn.

22:59.511 --> 23:01.047
You can't wear that to a funeral.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.857
Really?

23:03.014 --> 23:06.621
There's gonna be dozens of cops there.
Family members, city officials.

23:07.486 --> 23:10.365
Wait a second. Since when
do you need my help with interviews?

23:10.522 --> 23:13.901
Since it's me and potentially
200 interview subjects.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.206
And the fact
I'm delightful to be around...

23:16.361 --> 23:18.739
...that doesn't weigh
into your decision?

23:19.097 --> 23:20.405
Not even for a minute.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.543
- Let's go.
- Hey.

23:22.701 --> 23:26.444
I need to talk to Cindy for one second.
I'll meet you in the lobby.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.278
I really wanna go with him, Cindy.

23:31.443 --> 23:33.514
It's the closest I can get to reporting.

23:33.678 --> 23:37.490
- Okay, let's just postpone the meeting.
- No. You can do this.

23:37.649 --> 23:39.925
You are not only sensuous,
you're strong.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.691
Patti, I couldn't even convince
Beverly Buckley.

23:42.854 --> 23:45.596
But Vivian and Dottie
want this lawsuit, Cindy.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.794
They just don't know it yet.

23:47.959 --> 23:50.838
All you have to do is open their eyes.

23:50.996 --> 23:52.373
<i>Okay-</i>

23:53.965 --> 23:56.138
<i>Okay-</i>

24:01.706 --> 24:03.185
Yes, sir.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.624
Yes, sir.

24:08.814 --> 24:11.420
I understand completely.

24:11.616 --> 24:12.617
Yes, sir.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.554
Thank you.

24:15.420 --> 24:17.093
Have a good night.

24:23.061 --> 24:24.472
Did General Peers confirm?

24:24.629 --> 24:28.805
He said if Bom Laird or Dick Nixon
don't get advanced notice...

24:28.967 --> 24:31.948
...then News of the Week
doesn't either.

24:34.005 --> 24:35.040
Anything from Finn?

24:35.207 --> 24:37.983
Alistair Cullen said
a cabbie dropped off his Editor's Page.

24:39.411 --> 24:40.617
A cabbie?

24:41.646 --> 24:43.523
He's just jaunting around London'?

24:54.626 --> 24:56.196
All right.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.910
Fuck all. Try him one more time,
then get printer on the phone.

25:04.135 --> 25:05.136
Do it.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.957
You should have let me
buy you that coat.

25:15.113 --> 25:17.354
I don't need a coat.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.688
It's cold.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.227
Here.

25:20.919 --> 25:22.865
I'm in a three-piece.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.497
Thank you.

25:27.225 --> 25:29.102
Perfect 36.

25:35.500 --> 25:40.176
Remember our old place
over the Indian restaurant?

25:41.706 --> 25:45.119
I remember you screaming
at that poor man in Hindi.

25:45.277 --> 25:48.224
He was not a poor man.
He was a monster.

25:48.914 --> 25:52.123
You should hear the things
he said about you.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.523
He was just jealous.

25:54.686 --> 25:56.666
Because I was married to you.

25:59.791 --> 26:02.431
I was so happy there, Finn.

26:08.199 --> 26:10.201
I'm gonna give this guy
a little something.

26:10.368 --> 26:11.403
I'll be right back.

26:14.940 --> 26:17.580
I wonder if he'll take a request.

26:28.987 --> 26:31.263
I adore this song.

26:36.962 --> 26:38.202
I know.

26:39.898 --> 26:41.377

30:27.025 --> 30:29.266

32:05.957 --> 32:06.958

32:10.161 --> 32:14.906

We only raise the threat of a lawsuit
if they don't comply.

35:41.272 --> 35:42.615
Remember Lizzie Green?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.476
She complained
that her department head...

35:44.642 --> 35:46.815
...showed up at her house
in the middle of the night drunk...

35:46.978 --> 35:48.616
...and she got fired.

35:48.779 --> 35:51.191
- That scares me.
- Look, this is different.

35:51.349 --> 35:54.125
It's an official complaint.

35:54.285 --> 35:57.732

in front of the whole staff.

35:58.256 --> 35:59.394

35:59.790 --> 36:03.363

36:05.530 --> 36:06.736

Well, good for her then, but--

36:10.301 --> 36:12.212

36:12.370 --> 36:14.372

No. Look, you don't know
what you want.

36:34.959 --> 36:38.065
I did something new today.

36:38.462 --> 36:42.342
Something that,
if you had asked me yesterday...

36:42.500 --> 36:44.639
...I wouldn't have said I was missing...

36:44.802 --> 36:48.773
...because I didn't even know it was a...

36:48.940 --> 36:50.044
...thing.

36:50.208 --> 36:54.588
But now it's all I can think about.

36:54.745 --> 36:56.520
I am telling you...

36:56.681 --> 37:00.458
...life outside the pit is a thing.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.133
I mean, like, Vivian, you--

37:06.290 --> 37:09.294
You might wanna be
an editor someday.

37:09.460 --> 37:13.374
And maybe you would like
to be a reporter...

37:13.531 --> 37:16.410
...or a foreign correspondent or--

37:16.567 --> 37:20.242
How-- How could we know?

37:22.673 --> 37:25.654
Oh, and it's-- It's claret lemonade.

37:26.177 --> 37:29.056
It's half lemonade, half wine.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.251
And it is a revelation.

37:39.523 --> 37:42.333
My dad was born
not two miles from here.

37:42.493 --> 37:44.530
In Winslow Terrace.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.474
I grew up in that house.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.775
And God willing,
my boys will grow up there too.

37:51.969 --> 37:52.970
You see, us Kellys?

37:54.505 --> 37:56.382
We're from here.

37:56.774 --> 37:59.414
When my ma got pregnant,
my dad was all set to follow...

37:59.577 --> 38:01.079
...his old man into woodwork.

38:01.979 --> 38:04.619
But by then Brooklyn was changing.

38:05.182 --> 38:09.153
New people, new faces...

38:10.421 --> 38:12.367
My dad said
if he was gonna bring a kid...

38:12.523 --> 38:16.335
...into this world,
he wanted her to be safe.

38:17.995 --> 38:20.999
Twenty years he spent on the beat.

38:21.198 --> 38:22.506
Most of youse knew him.

38:23.501 --> 38:26.607
Some of you even helped him home
on a Sunday when the Dodgers lost.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.846
Before O'Malley screwed the pooch.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.822
We don't wanna lose our way of life.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.391
We don't want our streets
took away from us.

38:41.052 --> 38:46.798
I know that's why you, like my father,
put on that badge every day.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.599
And I thank you for that.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.665
God bless.

38:59.136 --> 39:02.345
"Brooklyn was changing"?
"We don't want to lose our way of life"?

39:02.506 --> 39:06.249
- How can you not see that as racism?
- She just lost her father, Patti.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.287
I know, and that is sad.

39:08.446 --> 39:10.585
But he gunned down innocent people.

39:10.748 --> 39:14.389
- We don't know that they were innocent.
- The FBI is inflating crime stats.

39:14.552 --> 39:16.259
Inflating, not fabricating.

39:16.420 --> 39:18.024
The Panthers do set off bombs.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.191
They do kill police officers in Brooklyn.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.998
It is a response to systemic racism.

39:23.260 --> 39:26.935
I'm not writing an article about racism.
I'm writing an article about violence.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.668
One is a reaction to the other.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.746
Are you trying to tell me what to write?

39:31.902 --> 39:35.042
I am suggesting, Doug...

39:35.206 --> 39:37.447
...that you write a story
about the Panthers...

39:37.608 --> 39:40.555
...that we haven't heard before.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.748
That means you have to...

39:42.913 --> 39:44.790
...write something meaningful.

39:44.949 --> 39:48.419

41:09.600 --> 41:11.273
...more seriously than a board game.

41:13.237 --> 41:14.716
They take it serious, all right.

41:16.373 --> 41:17.784
They fucking hate us.

41:18.242 --> 41:20.188

41:22.146 --> 41:25.457
It's not like I started the fucking war.
You see?

41:27.251 --> 41:29.356
You asked me about my hair.

41:29.520 --> 41:33.798
You know, a couple of us figure
if we look like hippies...

41:33.958 --> 41:36.336
...then maybe they won't
give us so much grief.

41:37.027 --> 41:39.439
And then it's harder for you to get a job.

41:39.597 --> 41:41.304
So you're damned if you do--

41:42.132 --> 41:45.079
The VA has a placement program.
Have they not been able to help?

41:45.903 --> 41:48.110
Yeah, a couple of my buddies
tried that.

41:48.272 --> 41:50.252
They're still looking for work.

41:50.407 --> 41:52.978
The dailies need drivers

41:53.143 --> 41:54.417
Maybe Sam can make a few calls.

41:54.778 --> 41:56.689
- I guess that'd be good.
- Of course.

41:56.847 --> 41:57.951

I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

43:28.505 --> 43:30.849
But it's <i>I</i> Dream of Jeannie.

43:32.076 --> 43:34.147
Not tonight, Lenny.

43:37.147 --> 43:40.822
<i>Really? Well,
I'd better tell Major Nelson.</i>

43:41.418 --> 43:42.829
<i>Darling, may we dance, please?</i>

43:42.987 --> 43:45.365
<i>Oh, I'd love to.</i>

43:45.522 --> 43:46.728
<i>Here we go.</i>

43:46.890 --> 43:50.997
<i>Major Nelson, Patricia,
what a coincidence.</i>

46:04.461 --> 46:06.441
Room 212.

46:07.064 --> 46:09.135
Can you please patch me through
to the London bureau...

46:09.299 --> 46:11.108
...of <i>News of the Week?
On Haymarket.</i>

46:11.268 --> 46:12.611
Thank you.

46:14.838 --> 46:18.012
Alistair, you old coot, you're in early.

46:18.175 --> 46:21.247
I wanted to make sure
you received my Editor's Page.

46:23.180 --> 46:25.888
No. Talia and I decided to--

46:26.049 --> 46:28.222
We decided to take in the town,
see the sites.

46:29.086 --> 46:31.123
Why? Is some--

46:33.824 --> 46:34.859
What?

46:37.795 --> 46:38.933
Finn?

46:41.799 --> 46:43.506
Is everything all right?

47:02.286 --> 47:03.390
DIVHIS PE RS]
Patti, Patti.

47:19.536 --> 47:20.537
What's up?

47:22.940 --> 47:24.647
Vivian and I are in.

47:25.409 --> 47:26.615
Oh, thank God.

47:26.777 --> 47:29.053
Ladies, I really need this.

47:30.848 --> 47:34.022
- So, what happens now?
- Okay, now we need to just get...

47:34.184 --> 47:37.063
...as many girls together,
but try to be discreet about it.

47:37.221 --> 47:39.997
If anyone were to find out
about this it'd be all over.

47:43.293 --> 47:44.397
All right, what is this?

47:45.329 --> 47:46.706
What's what?

47:46.930 --> 47:50.776
Patti, please. I wasn't born on a farm.
The four of you are up to something.

47:50.934 --> 47:54.245
We're not up to anything.
What would we even be up to?

47:54.638 --> 47:55.810
What are you up to, Jane?

47:56.473 --> 47:57.850
A tinkle.

47:59.009 --> 48:00.249
Wick!

48:00.477 --> 48:02.354
Wick fucking McFadden!

48:07.684 --> 48:10.164
Get the fuck down here.

48:14.224 --> 48:15.862
Where is he?

48:16.193 --> 48:17.365
Where the hell is he?

48:20.797 --> 48:21.969
You son of a bitch.

48:25.002 --> 48:26.413
You goddamn prick.

48:28.305 --> 48:30.148
You got some gall.

48:30.307 --> 48:31.445
What the hell is this?

48:33.877 --> 48:34.912
We tried to reach you.

48:35.078 --> 48:37.285
We tried you at the London bureau,
the hotel...

48:37.447 --> 48:39.427
Repeatedly.
- How was I not clear?

48:40.384 --> 48:43.831
What part of, "Run the fucking story"
did you misunderstand?

48:43.987 --> 48:47.400
General Peers would not confirm
or deny your story.

48:47.557 --> 48:50.436
So you write, "No comment,"
and you fucking run it.

48:50.594 --> 48:53.268
Tomorrow, Time Magazine
will have Songmy on the cover...

48:53.430 --> 48:56.843
...and you know what I've got?
The goddamn Week In Photos!

48:57.000 --> 48:58.809
It's a question of liability.

48:58.969 --> 49:02.678
I am the editor at large.
It is a question of insubordination.

49:02.839 --> 49:06.013
But you wanna write
the fucking magazine, don't you?

49:06.176 --> 49:08.053
You know, that's what you want.

49:08.211 --> 49:10.623
You want to write the magazine,
well, here you go.

49:10.781 --> 49:12.692
Because you know what's best,
don't you?

49:13.183 --> 49:14.662
Take the typewriter!

49:16.119 --> 49:17.655
This is unnecessary.

49:17.821 --> 49:20.461
Take the fucking typewriter,
you cocksucker.

49:21.091 --> 49:23.162
I am not taking
the goddamn typewriter.

49:23.327 --> 49:25.898
Then stop trying to do my fucking job!

49:31.868 --> 49:33.176
Get out of my newsroom.

49:34.304 --> 49:36.147
- Woodhouse--
- You're fired.

49:43.146 --> 49:45.649
Angie, have one of the girls
collect my belongings--

49:45.816 --> 49:48.194
We'll call for a courier.
Get the fuck out.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.203
Anyone else have a problem...

50:31.361 --> 50:33.341
...with the way things
run around here?
