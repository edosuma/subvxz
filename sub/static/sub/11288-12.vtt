00:18.318 --> 00:19.820
JUST LIKE
EVERY CHRISTMAS‐‐

00:19.886 --> 00:22.355

00:22.422 --> 00:23.724
NOW, KHADIJAH

00:23.790 --> 00:27.293
MAX DID HANG THE STOCKINGS

THE GIFT CERTIFICATE IS WORTH
A WHOPPING FIVE DOLLARS!

00:59.893 --> 01:02.603
MAX, I KNOW IT'S
THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS

01:02.669 --> 01:05.171
BUT WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

01:05.238 --> 01:06.707
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M...

01:06.773 --> 01:08.708

03:15.281 --> 03:16.717
WHAT DO YOU KNOW

03:16.783 --> 03:17.984
ABOUT THE NUMMY?

03:18.051 --> 03:20.120
I USED TO DATE A NEUROSURGEON.

03:20.186 --> 03:23.323
I LEFT HER WHEN SHE
STARTED WORKING MY NERVES.

03:23.389 --> 03:25.626
HEY, I HAVE

HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

03:40.641 --> 03:42.108
HE SAID THE "NUMMY"

03:42.175 --> 03:44.444
NOT "RICH MEN
WAITING FOR ME."

03:44.511 --> 03:46.780
RUSSELL, GIVE ME
THEM TICKETS.

03:46.847 --> 03:48.114
IF ONLY I COULD

03:48.181 --> 03:51.885
BUT I MUST FIGURE OUT
WHO TO TAKE.

03:51.952 --> 03:53.854
TAKE ME.

03:55.856 --> 03:57.123
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

03:57.190 --> 04:00.066
HOW LONG I'VE WAITED
TO HEAR THOSE WORDS.

04:01.802 --> 04:03.069
ALL RIGHT, RUSSELL

04:03.136 --> 04:05.138
I WILL LET YOU
SERVE AS MY ESCORT

04:05.205 --> 04:07.841
PROVIDED THAT YOU
DO NOT SCRATCH, ADJUST

04:07.908 --> 04:10.844

THEN I GET
TO CHOOSE YOURS.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.589
FIRST OFF, THIS
IS NOT BRA WEATHER.

04:24.290 --> 04:26.527
KHADIJAH, LET'S NOT
GO TO THIS THING.

04:26.593 --> 04:28.995
I HATE HANGING OUT
WITH SOCIETY PEOPLE.

04:29.062 --> 04:31.197
YOU SHOULD BE
USED TO IT BY NOW.

04:31.264 --> 04:32.733
YOUR MOTHER WAS
A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.

04:32.799 --> 04:34.233
YOUR FATHER'S
AN AMBASSADOR.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.602
I LOVE MY PARENTS

04:35.669 --> 04:38.972
BUT I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE
AVOIDING THEIR FRIENDS.

04:39.038 --> 04:40.874
THOSE PEOPLE
ARE THE OPPOSITE

04:40.941 --> 04:42.909
OF EVERYTHING
I'VE TRIED TO BE.

04:42.976 --> 04:46.813
I PUT MYSELF THROUGH SCHOOL,
I WORK AT A COMMUNITY HOSPITAL

04:46.880 --> 04:50.016
AND THE ONLY CLUB I BELONG TO
IS THE PRICE CLUB.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.518
OH, BABY, I UNDERSTAND

04:51.585 --> 04:54.087
BUT YOU CAN'T LET
THOSE PEOPLE STOP YOU

04:54.154 --> 04:56.189
FROM GETTING
WHAT'S YOURS.

04:56.256 --> 04:59.025
I DON'T LIKE THE PEOPLE
AT THE WAFFLE BARN

04:59.092 --> 05:01.067
BUT I STILL GETS
MY BREAKFAST.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.936

05:03.003 --> 05:05.038

05:09.409 --> 05:10.911
GOOSE LIVER
AND VENISON?

05:10.977 --> 05:12.178
MM‐HMM.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.748

05:14.815 --> 05:18.885
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO GIVE MAXINE
AN ELECTRIC CHAIR.

05:18.952 --> 05:22.689
I'LL BE DAMNED
IF SHE DIDN'T
BEAT ME TO IT.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.991
THIS IS WORSE
THAN THE CAKE

05:25.058 --> 05:27.728
SHE GAVE HERSELF
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

05:27.794 --> 05:31.832
MERRY DAMN CHRISTMAS,
THAT'S WHAT I GOT TO SAY.

05:31.898 --> 05:33.333
LET'S NOT BE TOO HARSH.

05:33.399 --> 05:36.703
MAX GAVE THE CHAIR TO HERSELF,
BUT SHE HAD IT DELIVERED HERE.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.005
OBVIOUSLY, SHE WANTS US
TO ENJOY IT TOO.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.340
CHECK THIS OUT.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.875
"FROM MAX TO MAX.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.277
"P.S. STOP READING MY CARD

05:44.344 --> 05:47.413
AND KEEP YOUR CHEEKS OFF
MY CHAIR."

05:47.480 --> 05:49.415
OH! OKAY, THAT'S IT.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.884
FIRE IT UP, OBIE.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.786

05:55.288 --> 05:57.390
ALL RIGHT, TRY SOME
OF THIS RIGHT HERE.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.625

OBIE, I THINK I'M
CHEATING ON YOU.

06:08.208 --> 06:10.677
HERE, BABY.

06:10.744 --> 06:13.046
MOMMY'S HERE
TO TAKE YOU HOME.

06:13.113 --> 06:14.515
SYNCLAIRE, GET UP.

06:14.581 --> 06:15.916
GET OFF. COME ON.

06:15.982 --> 06:18.885

GO GET YOUR DOLLY

06:18.952 --> 06:21.955
SO I CAN GET MY BABY
ACROSS THE STREET.

06:22.022 --> 06:24.891
OH, I LEFT MY DOLLY
IN THE VAN

06:24.958 --> 06:27.227
AND I LEFT MY VAN, UM...

06:27.293 --> 06:30.597
UH, WHERE DID

06:30.664 --> 06:32.799
PORTUGAL.

06:32.866 --> 06:34.568
OH, I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

06:34.635 --> 06:35.902
WELL, FORGET YOU.

06:35.969 --> 06:38.104

MAXINE, OUR CONSTANT
BICKERING NOTWITHSTANDING

06:46.279 --> 06:49.683
I REALLY DO HATE SEEING
YOU IN DIRE STRAITS.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.985
SO LET'S JUST
SIT BACK, RELAX

06:52.052 --> 06:55.188
AND TRY TO THINK
OF A SOLUTION, SHALL WE?

06:55.255 --> 06:57.190

WHICH CLIP‐ON TIE GOES BEST
WITH HIS BERMUDA SHORTS.

07:16.082 --> 07:18.051
EITHER DONALD TRUMP

AND TIED UP
IN A BROOM CLOSET

09:38.104 --> 09:41.041
HE'S DANGEROUSLY CLOSE
TO THE EMERGENCY EXIT.

09:41.107 --> 09:43.309
WHO'S THE LUCKY YOUNG MAN

09:43.376 --> 09:45.512
THAT HAD THE GOOD SENSE
AND GREAT FORTUNE

09:45.579 --> 09:46.947
TO ESCORT YOU HERE?

09:47.013 --> 09:48.314
DR. CHARLES ROBERTS.

09:48.381 --> 09:49.550
GOOD MAN.

09:49.616 --> 09:53.053
NEVER KNEW ANYONE
MORE DESERVING OF A NUMMY.

09:53.119 --> 09:55.488
YOU KNOW, IT SURE
WOULD BE NICE

09:55.556 --> 09:58.358
TO TOAST HIM WITH
A CHOCOLATE SODA.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.137
IF THIS DOESN'T
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER

10:04.204 --> 10:06.239
CONSULT YOUR PHYSICIAN.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.749
THANK YOU, MELANIE...

10:15.816 --> 10:17.551
ALTHEA...

10:17.618 --> 10:19.085
COMMISSIONER.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.790
RUSSELL, HOW DO YOU
KNOW THESE PEOPLE?

10:23.857 --> 10:26.392
MY SECOND WIFE
WAS A BLUE BLOOD.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.994
OR WAS IT MY THIRD?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.663
I GET THEM CONFUSED.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.198
IT WAS A PRETTY
CRAZY SUMMER.

10:32.265 --> 10:36.737
RUSSELL, HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN INTRODUCING ME AROUND?

10:36.803 --> 10:41.207
'CAUSE I'M A SENSITIVE MAN
AND YOU CALLED ME A PERVERT.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.776
I'M SORRY.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.778
NO. TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.047
JUST WALK AWAY.

10:47.113 --> 10:51.317
AH, AH, PUT A LITTLE
SHIMMY IN IT.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.189
KHADIJAH, I WAS
JUST TELLING ALISON

10:56.256 --> 10:58.224
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE
FLAVOR MAGAZINE PROJECT.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.426
OH, IT'S JUST
A LITTLE HOBBY

11:00.493 --> 11:03.637
THAT'S GOTTEN ME
FOUR JOURNALISM AWARDS.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.038
CAN I HAVE A COPY?

11:05.105 --> 11:07.440
I SPONSOR A YOUNGSTER IN BELIZE

11:07.508 --> 11:10.110
AND HE'LL REAL ANYTHING
IN ENGLISH.

11:10.176 --> 11:12.445
ALISON, DON'T
INSULT THE WOMAN.

11:12.513 --> 11:15.248
I'M SURE SHE NEEDS
EVERY COPY SHE HAS

11:15.315 --> 11:16.650
FOR THE HOOD.

11:19.185 --> 11:20.521
OH, EXCUSE US.

11:22.322 --> 11:25.792
GREETINGS ALL,
AND WELCOME TO
MY RUMPUS ROOM.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.828
THIS YEAR'S
NUMMY AWARD RECIPIENT

11:27.894 --> 11:29.763
IS LIKE THE SON
I'VE NEVER HAD

11:29.830 --> 11:32.533
WHICH, OF COURSE,
SAVED ME A BUNDLE IN TUITION.

11:32.599 --> 11:36.236
PLEASE,
WELCOME DR. CHARLES ROBERTS.

11:40.073 --> 11:44.210
WHEN I FIRST HEARD
I WAS RECEIVING THIS AWARD

11:44.277 --> 11:46.880
I WAS THRILLED AND HONORED.

11:47.981 --> 11:51.417
THEN I FOUND OUT THAT IT COMES
FROM A GROUP OF PEOPLE

11:51.484 --> 11:53.754
THAT TREAT ANYBODY
WITHOUT A PEDIGREE

11:53.820 --> 11:55.656
LIKE SOME EXHIBIT IN A ZOO.

11:55.722 --> 11:57.758
( crowd murmuring )

11:57.824 --> 12:00.701
FORGIVE ME. I'M, UH, RAMBLING.

12:00.767 --> 12:02.703
SO, IN CONCLUSION...

12:02.769 --> 12:05.572
TAKE YOUR AWARD AND SHOVE IT.

12:07.473 --> 12:11.411
AND, OH‐‐ I WOULD LIKE
TO THANK GOD AND MY MOTHER.

12:16.249 --> 12:17.518
RUSSELL‐‐

12:17.584 --> 12:19.786
THIS IS A THANK‐YOU
BASKET OF PRESERVES

12:19.853 --> 12:22.122
THAT WE LADIES
OF PRIVILEGE

12:22.188 --> 12:23.924
BESTOW UPON SOMEONE WHO
HAS DONE US A FAVOR.

12:24.591 --> 12:28.161
MAY I SMEAR SOME JAM
UPON YOU IN RETURN?

12:28.228 --> 12:30.831
AFTER I REALIZED
THAT YOU WERE WELL‐CONNECTED

12:30.897 --> 12:33.834
I BEGAN TO MENTION YOUR NAME,
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT

12:33.900 --> 12:37.270
I HAD AN INVITATION TO DINE
WITH ALISON AND HER FRIENDS.

12:37.337 --> 12:39.806
AND AS WE ALL KNOW,
LADIES WHO LUNCH

12:39.873 --> 12:41.875
KNOW THE MEN
WHO BUY DINNER.

12:41.942 --> 12:43.276
DON'T, REGINE.

12:43.343 --> 12:45.278
THOSE WOMEN ARE SHARKS.

12:45.345 --> 12:48.615
THEY'LL EAT YOU ALIVE
AND SPIT UP YOUR WIG.

12:48.682 --> 12:52.152
I'M TELLING YOU,
THOSE ARE SKINNY,
EVIL WOMEN.

12:52.218 --> 12:55.488
YOU HEARD HOW THEY ATTACKED
CHARLES AND KHADIJAH.

12:55.556 --> 12:57.157
WHO WAS ATTACKING
CHARLES?

12:57.223 --> 12:59.425
AND WHO THE HELL
WAS ATTACKING ME?

12:59.492 --> 13:01.401
REGINE'S LUNCH BUDDIES.

13:01.467 --> 13:03.504
TELL HER, LADY MARMALADE.

13:03.570 --> 13:05.706
ALL RIGHT, SPILL IT.

13:05.772 --> 13:07.373
I‐IT WAS NOTHING REALLY.

13:07.440 --> 13:10.243
I MEAN, IT WAS JUST
A FEW INNOCENT COMMENTS

13:10.310 --> 13:12.946
ABOUT... HOW CHARLES
DESTROYED HIS CAREER

13:13.013 --> 13:15.649
AND HOW HE'LL HAVE
TO TRADE IN HIS SCRUBS

13:15.716 --> 13:17.918
FOR A SQUEEGEE
AND SOME NEWSPAPER.

13:17.984 --> 13:19.853
CHARLES HAD EVERY RIGHT

13:19.920 --> 13:21.154
TO TELL OFF
THAT BOURGIE CROWD.

13:21.221 --> 13:23.156
KHADIJAH, WE ARE TALKING

13:23.223 --> 13:27.193
ABOUT VERY POWERFUL
AND INFLUENTIAL
PEOPLE, HONEY.

13:27.260 --> 13:29.796
I MEAN, PEOPLE WHO
HOLD CHARLES'S CAREER

13:29.863 --> 13:31.497
IN THE PALM
OF THEIR HANDS

13:31.565 --> 13:33.433
AND HE TOLD THEM
TO SHOVE IT.

13:33.499 --> 13:36.670
WHY DID WE HAVE TO GO
TO THAT STUPID PARTY, ANYWAY?

13:36.737 --> 13:38.939
MM‐MM, GIRL.

13:39.005 --> 13:40.473
YOU KNOW
THAT YOU TALKED HIM INTO GOING.

13:40.541 --> 13:43.109
DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY
CAN RUIN CHARLES'S CAREER?

13:43.176 --> 13:44.344
SWEETIE...

13:44.410 --> 13:46.913
THESE PEOPLE ARE SHALLOW

13:46.980 --> 13:50.551
THEY'RE PATRONIZING,
THEY'RE VINDICTIVE.

13:50.617 --> 13:53.887
OH, AND I'M LATE
FOR LUNCH WITH THEM.

13:53.954 --> 13:55.221
SMOOCHES.

13:57.891 --> 14:00.160
♪ TAKE THE CHAIR
WITH MY OWN DOLLY ♪

14:00.226 --> 14:03.369
♪ FA‐LA‐LA‐LA‐LA
YOU CAN'T BEAT MAX. ♪

14:09.543 --> 14:11.377
( groans )

14:11.912 --> 14:13.213
HEY...

14:13.279 --> 14:15.682
WHAT THE FREAK DID
YOU DO TO MY CHAIR?

14:15.749 --> 14:17.217
TECHNICALLY, NOTHING.

14:17.283 --> 14:19.586
WE DID, HOWEVER,
DRILL FIVE HOLES

14:19.653 --> 14:21.988
AND KIND OF BOLT IT
TO THE FLOOR.

14:22.055 --> 14:24.625
ALL RIGHT. OKAY,
UNBOLT THIS THING RIGHT NOW.

14:24.691 --> 14:27.160
I'M A LAWYER,
AND THAT IS MALICIOUS BOLTING

14:27.227 --> 14:28.461
WITH INTENT TO SCREW.

14:28.529 --> 14:30.363
OH, MAX, PLEASE.
YOU OWE US.

14:30.430 --> 14:33.600
YOU'VE BEEN RAIDING
OUR REFRIGERATOR FOR YEARS

14:33.667 --> 14:35.235
WATCHING OUR TELEVISION

14:35.301 --> 14:37.771
AND I DO BELIEVE
THOSE ARE MY SOCKS.

14:37.838 --> 14:39.039
IN OTHER WORDS

14:39.105 --> 14:41.374
THIS IS A LITTLE
THING CALLED

14:41.441 --> 14:43.009
"TIT FOR TAT."

14:43.076 --> 14:45.045
TALK TO HER, TAT.

14:45.111 --> 14:48.014
ASSUMING THAT EACH MASSAGE
IS WORTH A DOLLAR

14:48.081 --> 14:49.616
AT 20 MASSAGES PER WEEK

14:49.683 --> 14:52.753
YOU SHOULD PAY OFF YOUR DEBT
TO THIS HOUSEHOLD

14:52.819 --> 14:55.556
IN EXACTLY
FOUR MONTHS AND THREE DAYS.

14:55.622 --> 14:57.157
ALL RIGHT.

14:57.223 --> 15:00.901
THIS ROUND GOES
TO SATAN'S HELPERS.

15:00.967 --> 15:04.905
BUT BE WARNED‐‐
SATAN OWES ME BIG.

15:04.971 --> 15:06.940
ALL RIGHT NOW, YOU SEE THIS?

15:07.007 --> 15:09.676
WE NEVER SHOULD
HAVE DONE THIS, GUYS.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.211
YOU KNOW, THIS IS CHRISTMAS.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.179
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.316
I MEAN, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GIVE THIS CHAIR BACK, YOU KNOW?

15:16.382 --> 15:17.551
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

15:17.618 --> 15:20.020
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY
GIVE THIS CHAIR BACK.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.722
OH, OH, OH, MY BACK.

15:21.788 --> 15:22.956
OH, THIS IS...

15:23.023 --> 15:26.326
OH, HEAVEN MUST BE MISSING
AN EASY CHAIR.

15:26.392 --> 15:27.661
( chuckling )

15:27.728 --> 15:29.129
SO YOU UNDERSTAND, DOC.

15:29.195 --> 15:32.232
THOSE PEOPLE WERE DISRESPECTING
ME AND CHARLES ALL NIGHT.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.935
I MUST SAY, IT'S REFRESHING
TO SEE A YOUNG MAN

15:35.001 --> 15:37.303
SHOW SO MUCH PASSION
FOR HIS PRINCIPLES.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.839
TOO MANY PEOPLE YOUR AGE

15:38.905 --> 15:41.542
ONLY CARE ABOUT BIG HOUSES
AND FANCY CARS.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.676
( intercom buzzing )

15:42.743 --> 15:43.944
Woman:
Dr. Mountebank?

15:44.010 --> 15:46.412
The service is here
to wash your Rolls‐Royce.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.316
IT CAME WITH THE HOUSE.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.152
IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU CAN MAKE SURE

15:52.218 --> 15:54.788
CHARLES HASN'T RUINED
HIS REP WITH THE BIGWIGS?

15:54.855 --> 15:59.425
I'M SURE I CAN ASSUAGE THE HURT
FEELINGS OF THE BIGWIGS.

15:59.492 --> 16:03.570
IF NOT, I'LL... GET THEM DRUNK
AND TAKE PICTURES.

16:03.637 --> 16:05.506
OH, NO.

16:05.572 --> 16:08.241
EXCUSE ME,
DR. MOUNTEBANK.

16:08.308 --> 16:10.176
KHADIJAH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:10.243 --> 16:12.245
BOOKER IS GOING
TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE

16:12.312 --> 16:14.114
AND MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING IS COOL.

16:14.180 --> 16:15.749
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT THEM.

16:15.816 --> 16:18.451
I CARE ABOUT YOU TALKING
TO MY BOSS BEHIND MY BACK.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.020
I'LL JUST BE
OVER HERE.

16:20.086 --> 16:21.722
THAT'S THE THANKS I GET

16:21.788 --> 16:24.858
FOR COMING UP HERE TO SAVE
YOUR UNGRATEFUL BEHIND?

16:24.925 --> 16:27.728
QUEEN TAKES KNIGHT.

16:27.794 --> 16:29.495
I DON'T NEED YOU TO SAVE ME.

16:29.563 --> 16:31.998
IF THE ONLY WAY TO ADVANCE
IN MY CAREER

16:32.065 --> 16:34.234
IS TO BE PHONY, THEN FORGET IT.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.702
SO, WHAT DOES
THAT MAKE ME?

16:35.769 --> 16:36.837
A SELL‐OUT?

16:36.903 --> 16:38.138
( sighs )

16:38.204 --> 16:40.674
LOOK, I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

16:40.741 --> 16:43.910
I HAVE TO GO
RENDER SOMEBODY UNCONSCIOUS.

16:45.612 --> 16:47.714
YOUNG MAN HAS
A SERIOUS PROBLEM‐‐

16:47.781 --> 16:48.982
LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.385
I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE
'ROUND‐THE‐CLOCK FUDGE.

16:54.655 --> 16:58.959
I LIKE MY INTERIOR LATEX SHAKEN,
NOT STIRRED.

17:02.335 --> 17:03.436
OKAY, DUTCH BOY

17:03.504 --> 17:05.872
GET YOUR CAN
OUT OF THAT CHAIR.

17:07.973 --> 17:09.375
DAMN THAT CHARLES.

17:09.442 --> 17:12.345
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW UNGRATEFUL HE IS.

17:12.412 --> 17:15.549
WELL, SINCE THE SUBWAY RIDE HOME
DIDN'T HELP YOUR MOOD

17:15.616 --> 17:17.684
MAYBE MY COLORFUL
LITTLE FABLE WILL.

17:17.751 --> 17:19.484
YOU JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX.

17:20.721 --> 17:22.055
( clears throat )

17:22.122 --> 17:25.626
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU REALLY CARE
ABOUT SOMEONE

17:25.692 --> 17:28.595
IT'S DIFFICULT
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE

17:28.662 --> 17:32.365
BETWEEN HAVING THEIR BACK
AND GOING BEHIND IT.

17:32.432 --> 17:34.367
THAT'S IT?

17:34.434 --> 17:35.736
NO BEARS?

17:35.802 --> 17:39.005
NO PERPETRATING WOLF?

17:39.072 --> 17:41.441
IT WAS LONG, SO
I CUT STRAIGHT
TO THE MORAL.

17:41.508 --> 17:43.544
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING‐‐
I'M WRONG HERE?

17:43.610 --> 17:44.778
MAYBE NOT YOU

17:44.845 --> 17:46.479
BUT THE WELL‐MEANING GOOSE

17:46.547 --> 17:47.914
I CUT FROM THE FABLE.

17:47.981 --> 17:50.450
SHE TRIED TO HELP
HER FRIEND, THE BEAVER

17:50.517 --> 17:52.385
KEEP HIS ANESTHESIOLOGY AWARD

17:52.452 --> 17:53.787
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT IT

17:53.854 --> 17:56.657
BECAUSE IT CAME FROM
SOME BAD, SNOOTY BEAVERS.

17:56.723 --> 17:58.224
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

17:58.291 --> 18:00.400
SEE, THE BEAVER HERE
REPRESENTS...

18:00.466 --> 18:02.235
I GOT IT!

18:03.837 --> 18:05.539
MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO CHARLES.

18:05.606 --> 18:06.873
( doorbell ringing )

18:06.940 --> 18:10.043
WHY, I WONDER
WHO THAT COULD BE?

18:12.713 --> 18:14.080
CHARLES!

18:14.147 --> 18:16.216
WHAT A SURPRISE.

18:16.282 --> 18:18.084
MAYBE I KIND
OF CALLED HIM FOR YOU.

18:20.086 --> 18:21.822
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

18:21.888 --> 18:25.659
NO, SYNCLAIRE AND OVERTON
WANTED YOU TO SEE ME.

18:25.726 --> 18:27.594
GOOD. THEY'RE OPENING UP
A DIALOGUE.

18:27.661 --> 18:28.895
YOU THINK
THEY COULD HAVE

18:28.962 --> 18:30.631
THEIR DIALOGUE
IN THE OTHER ROOM

18:30.697 --> 18:32.032
SO I COULD USE
THAT CHAIR?

18:32.098 --> 18:33.233
COME ON NOW.

18:35.368 --> 18:37.037
( clears throat )

18:38.338 --> 18:40.907
LOOK, THE ONLY REASON
I WENT TO YOUR BOSS

18:40.974 --> 18:43.309
IS BECAUSE I FELT
PARTLY RESPONSIBLE.

18:43.376 --> 18:45.311
WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOUR INTENTIONS

18:45.378 --> 18:46.613
JUST NOT YOUR METHOD.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.081
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

18:48.148 --> 18:49.983
HAVING SOMEONE SPEAK UP FOR ME.

18:50.050 --> 18:51.918
LIKE YOU DID
FOR ME AT THAT PARTY?

18:51.985 --> 18:53.386
AH, TOUCHE.

18:53.453 --> 18:55.889
I MEAN, I SAW MY PARENTS
GET SUCKED IN

18:55.956 --> 18:57.691
BY BOURGIE PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

18:57.758 --> 18:59.893
I DON'T WANT
TO WAKE UP ONE MORNING

18:59.960 --> 19:02.002
AND DISCOVER
THAT I'M SKIPPING SURGERY

19:02.068 --> 19:04.838
TO GO OFF SKEET SHOOTING
OFF THE BACK OF MY YACHT.

19:04.905 --> 19:07.107
WITH YOUR AIM,
YOU COULDN'T HIT THE OCEAN.

19:07.173 --> 19:08.509
( chuckles )

19:08.575 --> 19:10.744
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE LIKE THEM

19:10.811 --> 19:12.646
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE

19:12.713 --> 19:13.747
OF WHAT THEY'VE GOT.

19:13.814 --> 19:15.415
MAYBE YOU'VE
GOT A POINT.

19:15.481 --> 19:17.851
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ME
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE

19:17.918 --> 19:20.153
THE SAME THING I DID
UP AT THAT PODIUM.

19:20.220 --> 19:21.321
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:21.387 --> 19:23.156
I WOULD HAVE DONE
WITH THAT AWARD

19:23.223 --> 19:25.091
WHAT YOU TOLD THEM
TO DO WITH IT.

19:26.693 --> 19:29.295
IT HAS BEEN A WHILE
SINCE SOMEBODY PISSED ME OFF

19:29.362 --> 19:30.463
THE WAY YOU DO.

19:30.531 --> 19:32.232
I LIKE YOU TOO.

19:35.602 --> 19:36.903
UH‐UH. GET UP, MOVE.

19:36.970 --> 19:38.338
GET OUT OF THE CHAIR.

19:38.404 --> 19:39.573
I NEED THIS CHAIR.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.174
GET UP, GET UP, GET UP.

19:41.241 --> 19:43.610
THE SHARKS MADE
SHORT WORK OF HER.

19:43.677 --> 19:46.747
THEY STUCK HER WITH
A FOUR‐FIGURE LUNCH TAB

19:46.813 --> 19:48.549
AT THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM.

19:48.615 --> 19:51.084
MAN, I WAS DRAGGED
INTO THE KITCHEN

19:51.151 --> 19:54.220
AND THEN I WAS MADE
TO SCRUB POTS AND PANS.

19:54.287 --> 19:56.623
HEY, DOES THIS THING
HAVE TURBO?

19:56.690 --> 19:58.625
LUCKILY, WHEN SHE
PHONED <i>FLAVOR</i>

19:58.692 --> 20:00.627
I WAS STILL
DILIGENTLY WORKING.

20:00.694 --> 20:03.937
I RUSHED OVER AND FOUND HER
CLEAVAGE‐DEEP IN SUDS.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.773
SO, I PULLED
SOME STRINGS

20:06.840 --> 20:08.975
WITH MY FRIEND BORIS,
THE MAITRE D'.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.043
THE WAY I SEE IT

20:10.110 --> 20:12.278
SHE'LL BE IN DEBT
TO ME FOR YEARS.

20:13.313 --> 20:17.083
OOH, LET ME WATCH YOU
FOR FIVE MINUTES

20:17.150 --> 20:19.520
AND WE'LL CALL IT EVEN.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.723
LORD, SHAKE
YOUR SHIMMY, NOW.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.758
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

20:28.128 --> 20:29.062
HA‐HA. HA‐HA.

20:29.129 --> 20:30.230
I GET THE CHAIR FIRST.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.732
I BEAT YOU BOTH. WHOO!

20:32.198 --> 20:33.634
THOUGHT YOU HAD HER,
SHORTY

20:33.700 --> 20:36.236
TILL SHE HIP‐CHECKED YOU
INTO THE GARBAGE.

20:36.302 --> 20:37.470
( chuckles )

20:37.538 --> 20:38.639
OH!

20:39.973 --> 20:42.576
ALL RIGHT,
COME ON, OBIE.

20:42.643 --> 20:44.110
HIT ME OFF.

20:44.177 --> 20:47.380
LET'S GO
FOR A LITTLE RIDE.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.584
COME ON NOW, STOP TEASING.

20:50.651 --> 20:51.752
HIT ME OFF.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.253
HIT ME OFF, MAN.

20:53.319 --> 20:56.389
LET'S GET IT
GOING ON. COME ON.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.724
I WISH I WERE, BABY

20:57.791 --> 20:59.760
BUT THE CHAIR'S
NOT WORKING.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.067
IT'S WORKING, ALL RIGHT.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.803
( gasps )

21:02.869 --> 21:04.738
EXCEPT YOU HAVE TO PUT A TOKEN

21:04.805 --> 21:06.873
ON THAT BIG OLD BOX ON THE SIDE.

21:08.274 --> 21:10.711
THEY'RE A BUCK APIECE.

21:10.777 --> 21:12.813
NO SNAPS, NO HAPS.

21:12.879 --> 21:14.447
NO, NO, NO.

21:14.515 --> 21:18.084
YOU WILL NOT EXTORT
ONE THIN DIME FROM ME, WOMAN.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.554
YOU AND THAT CHAIR‐‐
Y'ALL CAN GO TO HELL.

21:21.287 --> 21:23.256
SUIT YOURSELF.

21:23.323 --> 21:26.426
I GUESS YOU'LL JUST BE
RUBBING YOUR BACK UP

21:26.492 --> 21:28.094
AGAINST THE DOORKNOB.

21:30.130 --> 21:31.898
I'M DOWN FOR FIVE.

21:31.965 --> 21:33.066
GIVE ME 20.

21:33.133 --> 21:34.300
UM... UM...

21:34.367 --> 21:37.103
DO YOU TAKE A. T. M. CARDS?

21:39.072 --> 21:43.076
