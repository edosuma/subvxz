00:01.084 --> 00:02.791
[Hannah]
Previously on Designated Survivor...

00:02.920 --> 00:05.912
[Tom] You honestly think
this is worth $7 billion?

00:06.048 --> 00:08.460
- I think it's worth a lot more.
-Damn right.

00:08.592 --> 00:12.256
-I've never seen anyone this good.
-It's not work for him. It's who he is.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.966
Your story is not supposed to end here.
Let me bring you home.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.967
[all cheering]

00:20.103 --> 00:21.764
[Mike] Air Force One,
prepare for departure!

00:21.897 --> 00:24.059
It is imperative that we not become numb.

00:24.191 --> 00:28.401
The people we serve, they have faces,
families, hopes and dreams.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.237
They are worthy of our sacrifice,
our commitment.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.574
Agent Wells, until further notice,
you will be reporting to me.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.408
As long as we're following
the same breadcrumbs,

00:36.537 --> 00:38.278
-we might as well pool our resources.
-Agreed.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.747
[alarm blaring]

00:43.377 --> 00:45.038
You lied to me about everything.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.500
[Tom] These last few days have been awful.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.843
| will take tonight off
and make it up to you.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.133
I'll see you soon.

01:04.982 --> 01:05.972
[inaudible]

01:09.319 --> 01:12.311
[Dr. Louden] Do you have any reaction
to the front-page profile in today's Times

01:12.447 --> 01:14.654
-on Evan Beeman?
- I didn't read it.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.444
But you read the Times, right?

01:16.577 --> 01:17.988
Articles that I'm interested in.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.698
But an article on the man
who killed my wife

01:20.831 --> 01:23.573
because he ran a red light while texting
isn't one of them.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.167
And you didn't attend
his sentencing hearing either, right?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.298
-No.
-Why not?

01:29.423 --> 01:31.505
Because I'm President of the United States.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.802
It wouldn't have brought my wife back.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.592
| still want to talk to you
about your reaction to Alex's death.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.229
-[knock on door]
-Sorry to interrupt, Mr. President.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.897
The delegation is here.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.145
Thank you.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.488
We'll have to reschedule.
My office will be in touch.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.984
-Good. I can suggest another therapist.
-Excuse me?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.860
You wanted to see me after your wife died.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.158
But every time I raise her death,
you change the subject,

02:03.290 --> 02:05.577
cut the conversation short,
reschedule the session.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.700
Just so we're clear,
| didn't want to see you.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.418
My senior staff demanded it,

02:09.545 --> 02:12.129
and, if in case you haven't noticed,
| have a rather busy job.

02:12.257 --> 02:15.170
If you're too busy for our sessions,
then let's discontinue them.

02:15.886 --> 02:18.719
If you want to continue seeing me,
we'll finish this one today.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.215
And we'll talk about what happened
to you when your wife died.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.599
Because that matters.

02:24.728 --> 02:27.595
Fine. You wanna finish today's session,
you'll have to wait.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.564
-I've cleared my schedule.
-Good for you.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.070
I'm still getting questions
about the First Lady's memorial.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.607
-Like what?
-Why isn't there one?

02:35.739 --> 02:37.650
You can't have a memorial
without a headstone.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.569
Other question is
why she doesn't have a headstone.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.283
-It's only been ten weeks.
-[Lyor] Hey,

02:41.411 --> 02:44.073
you know what else has happened
in the past ten weeks? Nothing.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.571
-Lyor--
-He came right back to work

02:45.707 --> 02:49.200
after the First Lady's death,
and now he's President Hamlet.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.201
He's right, Em.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.795
| mean, the military spending bill
is stuck on the President's desk,

02:52.923 --> 02:54.379
judicial nominations are piling up,

02:54.508 --> 02:57.091
and he's put the brakes
on every major policy initiative.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.129
Including foreign ones.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.298
He canceled trips
to Beijing and Jerusalem,

03:00.430 --> 03:02.888
-bailed on the IMF meeting.
-This is turning into the ghost presidency.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.302
Okay, you all need to relax.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.096
The man just lost his wife,
the mother of his children.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.142
-It takes a while to recover from that.
-Understood, but the world keeps moving,

03:10.273 --> 03:12.105
and the White House
is getting left behind.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.724
Not today. It's the Cuban initiative.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.442
-It'll jump-start us.
-Good, 'cause we're flatlining.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.655
The FBI has completed its internal review.

03:24.788 --> 03:25.994
Now, the good news is,

03:26.123 --> 03:29.332
they've officially determined
Damian Rennett was a clean shot.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.451
-Took them ten weeks to figure that out?
-It took them ten weeks to decide

03:32.587 --> 03:34.328
whether to fire you
or put you on probation.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.000
If IAD had a problem with my reaction,

03:36.133 --> 03:38.625
why don't you ask how many of them
have shot someone in the chest.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.252
Or how many of them were sleeping
with the person they shot?

03:41.388 --> 03:44.631
-Oh. Okay, don't need this.
-Hannah...

03:47.936 --> 03:49.051
It's probation.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.978
And before you tell us to stick it,
understand this.

03:52.107 --> 03:55.520
They never found Damian's body or figured out
why he was in league with the Russians.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.940
The one thing we do know is you two
were involved,

03:59.072 --> 04:02.155
which means you're gonna have
to earn our trust back.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.239
[sighs] One more thing, Hannah.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.409
I'm asking...

04:10.250 --> 04:11.786
I'm asking as a friend.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.911
You took out someone you cared for.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.663
Are you okay?

04:18.675 --> 04:21.507
| was okay the second
| shot that son of a bitch.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.184
You ready for Havana?

04:27.309 --> 04:30.051
Yeah, my first job back
and I'm a glorified babysitter.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.019
And I'll be babysitting you.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.855
President Ortega,
this is an historic moment.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.850
Our trade delegation is looking forward
to meeting with you in Havana

04:37.986 --> 04:40.398
to discuss improving bilateral relations.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.522
[Ortega] Thank you, Mr. President.
I hope this is the first step

04:43.658 --> 04:46.867
in the continuing loosening
of financial and travel restrictions.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.577
A new era of cooperation.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.117
We're all hoping for that, sir.
Thank you.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.710
Senator Sanchez, congratulations.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.920
This trip would not be happening
without your tenacity.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.165
And your willingness to listen, sir.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.589
| hope investments can do
what 50 years of failed US policy couldn't.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.338
-So do I. Congratulations, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.305
Congratulations.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.769
Hey! Talking points for the Cuba trip.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.730
The president's getting criticism
for giving Ortega oxygen.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.849
Okay, so we make the trip
about the Cuban people.

05:18.985 --> 05:19.941
Yearning for freedom.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.732
Reaching out to an America
that they hope reaches back.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.775
-You might have a future in this.
-[chuckles]

05:24.908 --> 05:26.865
Hey... Turks and Caicos?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.404
-Haven't looked at the brochure yet.
-Okay.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.404
-Deposit on the villa's due at midnight.
-[sighs]

05:32.415 --> 05:33.405
Come here.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.583
| don't know if I can swing this right now.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.294
-We've talked about a trip for months.
- I know.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.414
And no offense, but your last vacation
involved a horse and buggy.

05:42.551 --> 05:45.589
-Oh!
-You deserve a break. We both do.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.420
-Plus, I'm even more charming on vacation.
-[chuckles]

05:48.557 --> 05:51.891
-You won't be able to handle it.
-The brochure. Got it.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.261
[Dr. Louden] Do you have a strategy?

05:56.940 --> 05:59.523
-A strategy for what?
-For processing everything.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.480
The story you tell yourself
about what happened to Alex.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.818
| know exactly what happened.

06:03.947 --> 06:07.440
But there's what happened
and your consciousness of it.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.442
For example,
who do you blame for Alex's death?

06:09.578 --> 06:11.444
Evan Beeman killed my wife.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.447
That's who's responsible, but who do you blame?

06:15.917 --> 06:18.955
| know this is gonna change
everything for us.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.919
But I have to do it.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.548
If I don't...

06:27.429 --> 06:29.045
| just have to.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.593
You still on my side?

06:34.269 --> 06:36.055
I'm always on your side...

06:37.105 --> 06:38.766
Mr. President.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.435
[Dr. Louden] You wanted to be president.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.685
Given the circumstances, it was my duty.
So, yes.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.608
Do you think Alex'd still be alive,
if you turned the job down?

06:46.740 --> 06:47.696
Yes.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.988
The president of the United States
is asking you to serve.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.986
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.704
We'd have to move.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.369
The kids would have to find new schools,
start over. We all would.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.333
This would really change our lives.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.044
In ways we can't even imagine.

07:02.172 --> 07:06.837
Okay, there are times to say no,
but this is not one of them.

07:06.968 --> 07:07.833
[chuckles]

07:08.678 --> 07:11.215
So Alex was the reason you took the HUD job.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.180
Meaning you wouldn't have been
the designated survi--

07:13.308 --> 07:15.515
You won't get me to blame my wife
for her own death.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.976
-That's not what I'm trying to do.
-Then what are you trying to do?!

07:18.104 --> 07:20.812
Getting you to accept
that causation is complicated,

07:20.941 --> 07:23.399
that every decision has an antecedent.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.610
She...

07:35.413 --> 07:37.666
She was my wife.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.413
She supported me. She had my back.

07:43.838 --> 07:47.001
But the choice was mine.
I'm the reason we stayed here.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.625
That's the only antecedent that matters.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.100
[indistinct chatter]

08:04.359 --> 08:08.444
Now, my Florida district is 32% Cuban,
so I had to take this trip.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.903
That doesn't mean I support
the president and his failed policies.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.990
We need lower taxes, more prisons,
more aircraft carriers,

08:14.119 --> 08:16.281
not a president who suddenly
can't make up his mind.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.995
If he doesn't shut up, I'll shoot him.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.080
Kirkman the Un-Decider.
We should call him that.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.495
Hey, Congressman, if you're feeding
off the president's trough,

08:22.627 --> 08:24.288
ease up on the criticism.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.539
-No offense, Aaron. I just call it as I see 'em.
-Call 'em somewhere else.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.006
Please, this is a trade mission,
not a campaign stop.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.631
-How was that?
- I still think I should shoot him.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.557
[brakes squeal]

08:50.405 --> 08:51.611
[indistinct chatter]

08:58.663 --> 08:59.698
Put that away.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.241
Why?

09:01.374 --> 09:04.287
That guy has a semi-automatic.
The other one's got a Beretta.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.081
-This guy's carrying a Glock.
-Nothing standard issue?

09:07.213 --> 09:08.590
No, they're not CRAF.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.880
-[gun firing]
-[all screaming]

09:20.518 --> 09:23.101
| am General Ramon Bravo,

09:23.229 --> 09:25.391
and you are all prisoners

09:25.523 --> 09:28.561
of the Army for the Liberation
of the People.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.609
[soldier shouting indistinctly]

09:35.742 --> 09:38.609
-Where did you leave your White House ID?
- I left it on the bus.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.416
[speaking Spanish]

10:05.855 --> 10:08.347
[in English] We're very glad to have
a White House official with us.

10:08.483 --> 10:09.598
[laughs]

10:11.361 --> 10:12.692
[soldier speaking Spanish]

10:13.947 --> 10:15.733
[continues speaking Spanish]

10:23.289 --> 10:25.326
[theme music playing]

10:34.884 --> 10:36.545
[speaking Spanish]

10:45.311 --> 10:46.096
[sighs]

10:46.229 --> 10:49.062
[in English] "The United States
once supported the Cuban people

10:49.190 --> 10:50.692
and their democratic aspirations.

10:50.817 --> 10:54.151
But now President Kirkman props up
a brutal and corrupt regime.

10:54.863 --> 10:59.573
The price for this treachery is
$500 million by tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.863
or the delegation of traitors
will be executed.”

11:05.248 --> 11:07.580
-Who are these people?
-We're trying to get a handle on that.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.451
Army for the Liberation of the People.
It's a guerrilla movement. 30,000 soldiers.

11:10.587 --> 11:11.702
-[Tom] Rebels.
-Yes, sir.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.421
40 years of skirmishes,
but they haven't made much headway.

11:14.549 --> 11:18.008
-[Tom] Seems they've upped their game.
-President Ortega is on the line.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.173
Mr. President, how did this happen?

11:20.305 --> 11:23.138
I don't know.
This delegation was a closely held secret.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.223
Maybe the ELP has a spy
in your administration.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.888
Maybe someone in your delegation
publicized the trip.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.978
I'm not interested in assigning blame
right now.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.562
I'm interested in getting our people back.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.685
I have already reached out to Ramon Bravo
through intermediaries,

11:35.820 --> 11:37.356
and he has not responded.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.694
Where are the hostages being held?

11:38.823 --> 11:42.316
The rebel base of operations
is the Sierra de los Organos mountains,

11:42.452 --> 11:44.409
a few hours outside of Havana.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.905
But the leaders move constantly.
They're hard to pinpoint.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.954
Dense tree cover.
Satellite imagery doesn't reveal much.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.042
[Ortega] That region is very difficult
fo access,

11:53.171 --> 11:55.788
especially with the men and resources
at my disposal.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.507
| understand.
We'll need your available intel.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.876
Of course. I'll be in touch.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.970
[Tom] Senator, get the congressional leadership

12:04.098 --> 12:05.964
-over to the White House.
-Yes, sir.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.262
| want options on my desk
as soon as possible, General.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.976
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.896
What are they talking about?

12:17.028 --> 12:18.894
They're talking about killing us.

12:20.907 --> 12:21.988
-Excuse me?
-What are you...

12:22.116 --> 12:24.983
Would you consider releasing
the women and the elderly?

12:25.119 --> 12:26.280
What did you say to me?

12:26.412 --> 12:29.404
You don't need 20 captives.
Half could be released.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.702
The gesture of goodwill
would go a long way.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.872
The assistant to the national
security advisor has a big mouth.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.620
Perhaps I should shut it.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.087
[speaking Spanish]

12:38.216 --> 12:41.083
-[in English] Maybe I'll shut yours, too!
-Stop, please.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.796
Please just stop, okay?
There is no need for this.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.639
We're here to do exactly as you ask.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.722
You're Phillip Cross, the businessman?

12:51.854 --> 12:56.849
Yes, that's right,
and maybe I can help you make a deal.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.271
[Bravo chuckles]

13:00.738 --> 13:03.730
You think I wanna hear what a capitalist pig
like you has to say?

13:03.866 --> 13:05.243
[speaking Spanish]

13:05.368 --> 13:06.733
[in English] Break his finger!

13:06.869 --> 13:10.157
Hannah, keep a low profile.
If they realize who you are, you're dead.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.952
They're not going to.
I'm getting out of here.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.574
[Cross struggling and yelling]

13:16.963 --> 13:22.174
Our fleet's in place. JSOC's recommendation is
a ground assault, backed by our naval assets.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.168
Kendra, what's the legality
of military action

13:24.304 --> 13:25.635
against rebels in another country?

13:25.763 --> 13:28.175
If American lives are at stake,
the rules of war allow it,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.549
especially if the foreign sovereign
is unwilling or unable to act.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.052
With Ortega, can I assume the latter?

13:33.187 --> 13:35.770
No, it's both.
He doesn't have the firepower.

13:35.898 --> 13:39.232
Even if he did, he can't be seen as actively
helping America to attack Cuban citizens,

13:39.360 --> 13:42.694
even those that oppose him. His grip on power
is loose enough as it is.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.860
He won't stand in our way.
I've interfaced with his top advisors.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.528
Ortega has given us access to his ports.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.528
General, is your opinion that military
action will secure the hostages' release?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.701
Sir, our consensus is that a show
of overwhelming force

13:53.833 --> 13:54.948
will bring the rebels to heel.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.951
-You can't guarantee it?
-No, sir, but perhaps a SEAL team--

13:58.087 --> 14:00.249
What other options do I have,
aside from military?

14:00.381 --> 14:02.497
-Ransom--
-Which is a non-starter.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.586
No, Lyor, the killing of Americans is
a non-starter.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.712
We've got congressmen, senators,
business leaders,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.590
my national security advisor.
This is a mess.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.218
We're running out of time.
| want options. Come on, people!

14:14.354 --> 14:17.096
-What about a recon mission?
-That's good. We can buttress our data.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.893
We'll know what we're getting into
if you deploy military assets.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.017
It could still be mistaken as aggression.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.519
What about a camera-equipped drone?

14:24.655 --> 14:28.740
Won't work because of the canopy, but
a Black Hawk, infrared cameras, low altitude...

14:29.327 --> 14:30.943
-A single one?
-Yes, sir.

14:32.830 --> 14:33.991
Okay.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.453
Let's find out what we're really dealing with.
Try it.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.087
He wants assurances.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.548
Guarantees.
You know what that sounds like?

14:45.676 --> 14:47.542
Yeah, a president who's gun-shy,

14:47.678 --> 14:50.386
which is exactly what he's been
since the First Lady's death.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.347
The problem is, if you don't risk anyone...

14:52.475 --> 14:54.762
-You risk everyone.
-Yeah.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.309
Mr. Boone?

15:00.441 --> 15:02.682
-Please don't do that.
-Do what?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.184
I'm carrying hot coffee.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.403
If you startle me and I spill it
on myself, cardiac arrest.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.900
2% of all males under 40 die from
a heart attack triggered by a liquid burn.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.197
- I don't think that's true.
-It could be.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.694
Sir, I'm Tricia Sims.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.038
You're interviewing me
today for the assistant job?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.453
-Come back.
-I've come back three times.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.168
You're obviously good at coming back.
Maybe that's your thing.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.879
| promise I won't take much of your time.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.873
| can promise you that, too.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.876
Mm-hmm.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.587
Yeah.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.976
And... hmm.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.341
You're good on paper.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.718
-You know what else is good on paper?
-No, sir.

15:38.855 --> 15:39.765
Ink.

15:39.897 --> 15:43.060
And ink smudges. It fades.

15:43.734 --> 15:47.022
It's temporary, just like all my assistants,

15:47.155 --> 15:49.362
because this job is very demanding.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.323
It requires perfection.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.988
| understand, sir.

15:56.247 --> 15:59.660
Good. Let's get you started, then,
on a trial basis.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.126
As you may know,
the president is an architect.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.541
He's been searching
for the original blueprint

16:05.673 --> 16:07.630
of the Capitol forever.

16:07.758 --> 16:11.376
-I see why it would mean a lot to him.
-Which is why I want you to hunt it down.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.594
Start with Madge in Records.
She knows everything.

16:13.723 --> 16:16.306
Will do. Thank you, sir.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.549
Mm-hmm.

16:18.936 --> 16:22.895
-Oh, and... Tricia.
-Yes?

16:23.024 --> 16:24.981
You know what else causes heart attacks
in men under 407?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.315
No, sir.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.232
-Failure.
-[phone rings]

16:30.198 --> 16:31.609
Yeah.

16:31.741 --> 16:36.201
No, we'll do the photo op with the CHC
after the delegation returns. After.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.447
[man] Sir, the Black Hawk's on course.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.120
[pilot on radio] This is Tango One.
We're picking up a heat signature.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.835
2-3-7 north by 8-2-4 west.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.169
Tango One, extend your perimeter.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.335
-General?
-It's a pretty remote location.

16:49.467 --> 16:54.553
Something's there, but we can't tell yet whether
it's a generator, furnace or installation.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.932
[pilot] We have incoming--

16:56.057 --> 16:58.014
What just happened?

16:59.227 --> 17:01.434
Tango One, this is Motherboard.
Do you copy?

17:02.104 --> 17:04.686
Tango One, this is Motherboard.
Do you copy?

17:06.651 --> 17:08.267
We just lost Tango One, sir.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.578
There were no casualties, okay?

17:20.705 --> 17:24.915
The crew managed to pilot the damaged
Black Hawk to a nearby carrier. O'Neil?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.125
Why did the rescue mission fail?

17:26.253 --> 17:29.087
It was not a rescue mission,
it was a peaceable recon mission.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.628
Which is no longer secret.
Aren't the hostages in greater danger?

17:32.760 --> 17:35.377
The president's doing all he can
to secure their safe return.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.095
I'll let you know when I have more.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.056
When Corwin asked if the Black Hawk
meant the president wasn't battle-tested,

17:40.184 --> 17:41.925
you said, "No,
because it wasn't a battle."

17:42.061 --> 17:43.893
-Which was accurate.
-But a bit flip.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.137
The Chronicle's coverage of the Administration
has been unfriendly.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.935
-We need to court them a bit more.
-Okay.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.728
When Deveraux asked if the president

17:49.860 --> 17:51.851
was accepting counsel
from the secretary of defense--

17:51.988 --> 17:53.478
| said the president's decision-making--

17:53.614 --> 17:56.982
Isn't for public debate,
which is true, but so combative.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.951
-I was taking fire in there.
-You can't fire back.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.035
My options are limited.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.244
I'm defending an administration

18:02.373 --> 18:04.865
that hasn't taken decisive action
on anything in the last ten weeks.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.958
You can't defend us
if you're taking the bait.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.412
[scoffs] Okay.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.791
Less flip. Don't take the bait.
Don't fire back. Duly noted.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.337
Thank you.

18:20.808 --> 18:24.142
[Alex on recording]
Hello, Tom Kirkman's voicemail.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.261
This is Tom Kirkman's wife,

18:26.397 --> 18:31.267
who is no longer the subject or target
of a federal investigation.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.977
| beat it.

18:34.697 --> 18:35.732
We beat it.

18:36.574 --> 18:41.034
And the only thing I want to say to you
is I love you.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.334
Hello, Tom Kirkman's voicemail.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.871
This is Tom Kirkman's wife,

18:53.007 --> 18:57.797
who is no longer the subject or target
of a federal investigation.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.091
So your kids, how are they handling things?

19:01.223 --> 19:02.805
We're not here to talk about my kids.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.594
We're here to talk about you,

19:04.727 --> 19:07.560
but your kids
are a big part of your life, right?

19:15.279 --> 19:16.269
[sighs]

19:41.847 --> 19:42.803
Penny?

19:44.475 --> 19:46.933
Sweetheart, I need you to wake up.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.551
Dad?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.847
Come here, darling, please. Sit up.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.358
| don't know how to do this.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.402
Dad, what's wrong?

20:04.662 --> 20:06.118
There...

20:07.957 --> 20:10.198
There has been a terrible accident.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.832
Mommy was in a terrible accident.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.083
And sometimes accidents are so bad that...

20:19.218 --> 20:22.927
that the people who are in them,
they can't come home.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.593
Mommy's not coming home?

20:28.519 --> 20:29.975
No, sweetheart.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.142
-She's in heaven now, with the angels.
-[sniffles]

20:33.274 --> 20:36.107
Why isn't Mommy coming home?

20:36.819 --> 20:37.729
[sniffles]

20:38.863 --> 20:42.072
-I'm sorry, sweetheart.
-[sobbing] I want to see my mom.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.691
-I know.
-I want my mommy.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.990
| know. I know. I know.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.283
[Penny sobbing]

20:50.416 --> 20:53.329
[Tom] Penny reacted like you'd expect
any little girl to react,

20:53.461 --> 20:56.078
who had just been told
her mother was Killed.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.963
How did Leo react?

21:03.137 --> 21:04.844
She's gone, Leo.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.131
Come here.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.235
[sobbing] She hated it here.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.440
You should have never brought us here.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.036
| watched his youth vanish before my eyes
in a second.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.874
That must have been difficult.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.210
Yeah, it was.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.832
You know, Tom, there is no one way

21:41.967 --> 21:46.177
for a person in Leo's position to react,
or a little girl.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.296
It's different for everybody.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.091
But what I find interesting is,
ten weeks in,

21:51.227 --> 21:54.310
-you're finally opening up about your kids.
-What are you getting at?

21:54.438 --> 21:56.349
Why were you so reluctant
to talk about your children?

21:56.482 --> 21:58.098
They're not the ones in therapy.

21:58.234 --> 22:02.819
No, you are, and you were protecting them,
which is a way of protecting yourself.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.062
From what?

22:05.157 --> 22:08.149
If you don't share their reactions,
you don't have to share yours

22:08.285 --> 22:10.242
and the one thing
you don't want to confront.

22:10.371 --> 22:11.532
Which is?

22:11.664 --> 22:12.870
Grief.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.098
[Tom] I grieve for my wife every day.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.225
-Do you grieve in public?
-No.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.817
-So, in private?
-Yes.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.778
-Have you cried?
-What the hell does that matter?

22:45.906 --> 22:49.149
Because grief is a ritual,
and if you don't engage in it,

22:49.285 --> 22:52.619
-either in public or--
-What the hell do you expect of me?

22:53.956 --> 22:55.913
It's what you expect of yourself, Tom.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.955
And if you think
your behavior is adaptive,

23:00.087 --> 23:01.873
I'm not sure why you wanna see me.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.748
And don't tell me
it's because your staff made you.

23:07.428 --> 23:10.671
Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.887
[soldier speaking Spanish]

23:12.850 --> 23:13.635
[in English] Yeah.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.757
[speaking Spanish]

23:23.319 --> 23:26.277
[Blutner in English] No, I never voted
with Tom Kirkman for anything.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.397
You can look it up.
I'm one of his fiercest critics.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.960
I'm here for Cuba, not Ortega.

23:43.964 --> 23:44.829
[soldier shouts indistinctly]

23:47.426 --> 23:48.416
[speaking Spanish]

23:49.345 --> 23:50.927
[in English] Unlike Kirkman,
| believe in the rule of the people.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.841
-Unlike President Kirkman?
-[soldiers shouting]

23:52.973 --> 23:55.351
-You son of a bitch!
-Come on!

23:55.476 --> 23:57.308
He doesn't know what he's talking about!

23:57.436 --> 24:00.303
I'll make sure the president knows
what a self-serving traitor you are!

24:00.439 --> 24:02.601
Shut up and sit down now! Shut up!

24:02.733 --> 24:03.689
Sit back down!

24:03.817 --> 24:05.524
Sit back down and shut up!

24:06.654 --> 24:07.894
Stop it!

24:12.576 --> 24:14.567
[Bravo] ...the Caymans are too close.

24:15.371 --> 24:16.406
[chuckles]

24:17.957 --> 24:19.118
Of course.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.035
-[indistinct whispering]
-[Bravo] Okay.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.285
We should go back in.

24:24.421 --> 24:25.673
[speaking Spanish]

24:47.653 --> 24:48.814
[speaking Spanish]

24:49.405 --> 24:50.190
[in English] Okay.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.110
-[speaks Spanish]
-[in English] Okay, okay.

25:06.463 --> 25:07.840
[speaking Spanish]

25:14.304 --> 25:17.217
So, you told the president
there's no legal bar to ransom?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.932
Correct, the executive branch
has absolute discretion.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.926
Which he would set a dangerous precedent
by exercising it.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.144
-Which is exactly what I told him.
-What did he say?

25:24.273 --> 25:27.106
That America hasn't faced
the execution of hostages,

25:27.234 --> 25:29.066
including six senators
and five congressmen.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.276
That he'd rather be criticized
for how he kept them alive

25:31.405 --> 25:33.567
-than how he let them die.
-What did you say?

25:33.699 --> 25:36.191
That the old Tom Kirkman
would have advocated military action.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.943
That his tentative behavior
could get more people killed.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.912
-You didn't tell him that.
-Of course not, I like my job.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.203
Okay, so if it's ransom,
we need congressional support.

25:44.334 --> 25:47.463
-Senator Sanchez is our power broker here.
-She's on her way.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.966
-We're getting Aaron back.
-Yeah, safe and sound.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.424
Let's make it happen.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.275
[soldier] Sit.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.274
[speaking Spanish]

26:19.787 --> 26:21.994
-[in English] Are you all right?
-Yeah.

26:22.122 --> 26:24.989
[speaking Spanish]

26:27.336 --> 26:29.327
-[in English] I want her dead.
-[Cross] Hey, listen.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.625
Don't do that again.
They'll kill you.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.043
| can take care of myself.

26:33.175 --> 26:34.256
Hannah, he's right.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.251
They're talking about
what to do with you next.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.764
None of the options are good.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.220
We have nothing to do with her.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.465
Segregate the cooperatives
from the ones who aren't.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.184
Hey, Congressman, sit down and shut up.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.724
[soldier speaking Spanish]

26:47.856 --> 26:50.894
-[in English] Jackass.
- I know, but he's not the problem, Aaron.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.562
Cross is.

26:52.694 --> 26:55.607
-What are you talking about?
-He's working with them, Aaron.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.994
[Sanchez] I've reached out to congressional
leadership. We feel ransom is ill-advised.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.283
And you've made my case?

27:04.414 --> 27:06.621
| promised my colleagues
I'd make my case to you. Military--

27:06.750 --> 27:09.037
-We already discussed this.
-Mr. President--

27:09.169 --> 27:11.410
My goal is to save lives, not cost them.

27:11.547 --> 27:16.292
Military action will result in casualties.
Writing a check we can afford won't.

27:16.426 --> 27:17.461
You don't know that, sir.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.552
Tell the leadership if this goes south,
I'll take full responsibility,

27:20.681 --> 27:22.297
but this is what we're doing.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.726
Emily, reach out to Treasury.
Put this in motion.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.016
[Emily] Yes, sir.

27:30.107 --> 27:32.849
So, ransom it is.

27:34.236 --> 27:37.649
In the last two months, he's withdrawn
50% of our troops from Iraq and Syria.

27:37.781 --> 27:41.991
He's introduced a bill to double the budget
for Homeland Security. And now ransom.

27:42.119 --> 27:45.862
He's trying to protect everyone.
You know what you call that?

27:45.998 --> 27:47.033
[Dr. Louden] Trauma.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.198
I'm sorry. Is that a question?

27:49.334 --> 27:51.496
Do you think your wife's death
traumatized you?

27:52.754 --> 27:55.837
- I think you know the answer to that.
-But do you?

27:55.966 --> 27:58.424
[Emily] Do you want Alex
to have a state funeral?

28:00.679 --> 28:01.885
No.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.339
-A private one, then?
-Yes.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.852
The existing plot at Westchester Cedars?

28:09.271 --> 28:10.636
That'll be fine.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.150
| have the...

28:17.696 --> 28:19.687
| have the guest list for you to look over,

28:19.823 --> 28:24.442
as well as some flower arrangements
and the obituaries.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.618
I'm sorry, what did you say?

28:29.750 --> 28:32.959
The guest list,
the flowers and the obituaries.

28:34.296 --> 28:36.833
Okay. Thank you, Emily.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.885
Of course my wife's death traumatized me.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.883
Why's it so important
| acknowledge that to you?

28:49.019 --> 28:50.555
Do you think it's important?

28:53.148 --> 28:57.016
| think, for $800 an hour,
you shouldn't ask such obvious questions.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.894
You're right.
You should be asking yourself.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.442
But I will make an observation.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.862
You're the president.
To do your job, you need a clear head.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.531
If you bring unresolved emaotion
into the decisional--

29:08.664 --> 29:09.995
| don't.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.989
Unintentionally, Tom.

29:14.878 --> 29:18.963
But that's the problem.
It's what you're doing unintentionally.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.510
-[officer] Ten-hut!
-[Tom] As you were.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.879
[Emily] Secretary Braden said
the funds have been made available.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.302
All that remains is for you
to okay the wire transfer.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.425
Where do we stand on the release
of the hostages?

29:31.561 --> 29:33.973
We have Ramon Bravo's promise
to put them on a bus

29:34.106 --> 29:37.064
to Marti International Airport,
once he confirms receipt of the funds.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.024
Can we corroborate that there's a bus
at the site?

29:39.152 --> 29:41.610
-No, we cannot.
-We won't be able to corroborate anything.

29:41.738 --> 29:44.230
The essence of ransom is blind faith.

29:44.366 --> 29:47.950
Bravo will either keep his word
or he won't.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.370
Mr. President...

29:56.670 --> 29:59.253
If you bring unresolved emaotion
into the decisional--

29:59.381 --> 30:01.338
-I don't.
-Unintentionally, Tom.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.922
-General, cancel the wire transfer.
-Sir.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.045
-How long to get your men ashore?
-45 minutes.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.047
Bring the fleet in
as close to land as possible.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.436
If a show of force
doesn't get the insurgents to back down,

30:12.561 --> 30:14.552
-send in the Marines.
-Yes, sir.

30:14.688 --> 30:16.304
I'll have a congressional statement of support

30:16.440 --> 30:17.726
-ready to issue.
-Good.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.771
What the hell just happened?

30:21.903 --> 30:24.611
He made the hard decision,
but the right one.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.697
| think the president's back.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.156
Hallelujah.

30:39.629 --> 30:40.755
What are you doing?

30:40.881 --> 30:43.293
| talked to Madge,
who told me to check with Earl--

30:43.425 --> 30:44.290
In the basement?

30:44.426 --> 30:47.293
Yes, and Earl sent me
to the records annex.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.636
-You got these from the annex?
-Mm-hmm.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.756
No one's opened that room in 50 years.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.929
It's a breeding ground for black mold. Look.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.018
-Black mold?
-Stachybotrys chartarum.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.763
It can cause serious respiratory illness.

30:58.899 --> 31:02.767
Do this in a contained environment
with a mask and a hazmat suit.

31:02.903 --> 31:06.112
-The president needs--
-Emily, this is Tricia Sims.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.855
She was down in the annex.

31:08.784 --> 31:12.243
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
| hope you were wearing a hazmat suit.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.830
It was nice meeting you.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.342
-You didn't hear them talking about it.
- I didn't need to.

31:28.470 --> 31:31.804
-Maybe he was trying to broker a deal.
-It was too familiar for that, Aaron.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.387
-Well, they broke his hand.
-Did they?

31:36.520 --> 31:37.806
[solider in Spanish]

31:42.442 --> 31:43.477
[in English] Hey.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.191
-Thanks.
-[soldier] Enough! Sit down!

31:48.323 --> 31:50.234
Everyone sit down.

31:50.367 --> 31:54.281
You're right. He didn't seem to have a problem
with his broken hand.

31:59.876 --> 32:00.911
[Bravo] Get up.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.918
Get up. Get up.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.424
Hey, hey. What...

32:11.388 --> 32:13.345
The payment has not been made.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.805
| see you've moved your fleet into place.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.891
You doubt my resolve.

32:18.019 --> 32:21.011
So, I will begin killing the hostages,

32:21.148 --> 32:24.436
and I'll start with this spy,
Hannah Wells.

32:24.568 --> 32:27.105
Mr. Bravo, I'm prepared to keep
one of two promises.

32:27.237 --> 32:30.355
The first was to act as an arbiter,
between you and President Ortega

32:30.490 --> 32:34.734
-So you could air your grievances.
-Wire the money now or I will kill her.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.487
The second is if you hurt one hostage,
we will hunt you down,

32:37.622 --> 32:41.411
-we will find you and we will kill you.
-[speaking Spanish]

32:41.543 --> 32:43.580
[Cross in English] Wait! Wait, please.

32:43.712 --> 32:45.043
Please, just...

32:45.172 --> 32:46.913
Please, wait.

32:47.048 --> 32:50.632
I'll pay the ransom.
I'll pay the ransom! Every penny of it.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.303
Let her go.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.380
Please just let us go.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.640
Mr. President, Hannah's signaling us.

33:01.771 --> 33:02.636
How do you figure?

33:02.772 --> 33:04.979
She's not Catholic,
but just did the sign of the cross.

33:05.108 --> 33:08.100
The hostage offering
to pay the ransom is Phillip Cross

33:08.236 --> 33:09.818
-of Cross International Development.
-Look into it.

33:09.946 --> 33:10.731
Yes, sir.

33:10.864 --> 33:13.526
General, if the hostages aren't free
in the next 30 minutes,

33:13.658 --> 33:16.901
- I want our troops to make landfall.
-Yes, Mr. President.

33:18.079 --> 33:21.697
Cross' passport shows six visits to Cuba
in the past two years.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.074
-To do what?
- I don't know, but I ran his cell.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.827
Excuse me. Get this.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.708
He's called Ramon Bravo 12 times since August.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.672
His captor. That doesn't make any sense.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.471
Unless they're in on this together.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.337
Cross is a billionaire.
He doesn't need the ransom.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.760
Exactly.
Which is why the ransom could be a ruse.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.181
His company specializes in resorts, right?

33:43.313 --> 33:46.681
Cuba will be the Caribbean Riviera
when it opens for investment.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.899
Maybe he funded the rebels
in exchange for land rights,

33:50.028 --> 33:51.439
which would be worth billions.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.903
But why would he think that Bravo
could give him real estate?

33:54.032 --> 33:57.024
-The ELP hasn't made headway in decades.
-Maybe Cross was hedging his bets,

33:57.160 --> 33:58.901
backing both horses
until one pulled ahead.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.153
You need to check if Cross was also coordinating
with Ortega.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.950
-Is there a way to dump his phones?
-Yup.

34:03.083 --> 34:06.041
We were looking for connections
between Ortega and Cross.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.752
We found something very different.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.172
| don't believe it.

34:16.304 --> 34:22.141
Those phone records prove Ortega and Bravo
conspired to frame the rebels.

34:23.018 --> 34:24.635
That doesn't make any sense.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.353
It does if you put yourself
in Bravo's shoes.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.975
He's 75.
A life of struggle has gotten him nothing.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.351
So, he kidnaps our delegation.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.524
He has to know there will be
a military response,

34:34.656 --> 34:36.021
one that will destroy the rebels.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.487
Ortega is paying him off.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.826
So Bravo gets money,
a financial legacy for his family.

34:40.954 --> 34:44.288
Cross' price for delivering the delegation
is development rights worth billions.

34:44.416 --> 34:48.455
And Ortega gets to hold on to power
just as soon as we destroy the ELP.

34:48.587 --> 34:52.000
| know President Ortega.
He wouldn't endanger Americans this way.

34:52.132 --> 34:55.716
Senator Sanchez,
if you do this long enough,

34:55.844 --> 34:58.302
you realize you don't really know anyone.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.802
I am pleased to announce
the delegation's plane

35:06.938 --> 35:09.179
has left Marti Airport.

35:09.316 --> 35:10.772
I'm very glad to hear it.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.983
But the ELP must be destroyed
for this treachery.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.979
-We need America's help.
-You're not gonna get it, sir.

35:17.574 --> 35:18.609
| don't understand.

35:18.742 --> 35:21.359
Phillip Cross has already been debriefed.
He confessed.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.820
-Confessed to what?
-Your collusion with Ramon Bravo.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.494
The evidence has been uploaded
to the official Cuban news agency website.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.915
Phone records, bank payments.
All for the Cuban people to see.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.788
We don't even have
to bring you both to justice.

35:33.923 --> 35:37.666
We're gonna let your people do it for us.
Good luck, Mr. President.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.725
-Hey.
-[Emily] Hey.

35:47.854 --> 35:51.688
| have the latest draft of talking points
on Cuba for your approval.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.978
"United States supports
Cuban self-determination.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.818
With the overthrow of President Ortega
and the ouster of Ramon Bravo..."

35:56.946 --> 35:59.813
"...we look forward to a democratic future
for the Cuban people.”

35:59.949 --> 36:01.860
I'll make some changes
and get back to you.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.202
All right. So, Turks and Caicos...

36:07.540 --> 36:10.248
- don't think it's a good idea.
- figured you didn't.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.743
It's why you have problems
with my press briefing.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.917
It's why you give me notes
on things you never note.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.416
You're trying to tell me that something's wrong
without telling me.

36:18.551 --> 36:20.212
What are we doing here, Seth?

36:20.345 --> 36:21.460
-We're dating.
-I know.

36:21.596 --> 36:25.305
It was two days a week. And then
the First Lady died and it became five.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.935
If it's too fast, too soon--

36:27.060 --> 36:29.893
No... I like it.
| just don't know what it is.

36:30.480 --> 36:33.768
Alright. Your use of indefinite pronouns
isn't helping here.

36:33.900 --> 36:37.188
It's like we flipped a switch.
And I am not a switch flipper.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.403
Okay. If you're saying that things
are moving too fast,

36:40.532 --> 36:43.900
and you wanna roll it back to once a week,
that's fine.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.322
-That day will be the best day of my week.
-Seth--

36:46.454 --> 36:49.537
But if you're trying to tell me
that you're not sure about it,

36:49.666 --> 36:50.872
about us...

36:51.376 --> 36:53.037
Then I need you to just say that.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.630
I'm saying I don't know.

37:01.594 --> 37:02.755
Well, I do.

37:05.682 --> 37:07.423
And when you do, give me a call.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.471
[Tricia] You wanted to see me?

37:15.984 --> 37:18.021
Yeah. No.

37:18.153 --> 37:21.942
All right, the answer's been no
for six weeks. It's still no.

37:22.782 --> 37:26.150
So, about the blueprint.
You can call off the dogs now.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.617
-I can?
-Yeah.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.158
The point of the task wasn't to find
the blueprint.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.655
-It wasn't?
-No.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.909
This job is about perseverance
and learning to navigate

37:35.044 --> 37:36.330
a mind-numbing bureaucracy.

37:36.463 --> 37:39.751
-An interesting introduction to it--
-Here it is, Mr. Boone.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.044
What?

37:44.596 --> 37:46.837
The papers of the architect
who designed the Capitol

37:46.973 --> 37:50.307
aren't the White House.
They're in the National Archives.

37:50.435 --> 37:54.053
They wouldn't let me take them,
so I took high-res pictures,

37:54.189 --> 37:56.351
had them color corrected and enlarged.

37:56.483 --> 37:57.973
Polychromatic paper.

37:58.109 --> 38:01.192
-Smart.
-Can I tell you something, Mr. Boone?

38:01.946 --> 38:05.530
After finding this blueprint,
you can tell me a few things.

38:05.658 --> 38:09.492
My dad works in construction.
My mom, she cleans houses.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.612
They worked their whole lives
to send me to college,

38:11.748 --> 38:13.705
and now I have a job at the White House.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.657
The White House.

38:16.461 --> 38:19.453
| will find the blueprints to Atlantis
if you ask me.

38:24.928 --> 38:25.838
Oh, I will.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.098
[Tom] She called me, you know.

38:32.227 --> 38:35.436
-When?
-Right before she was killed.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.480
Left me a message.

38:41.236 --> 38:42.726
Said she loved me.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.901
| never got to say it back.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.571
How were things left between you two?

38:52.789 --> 38:55.201
It was a tough time.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.199
We weren't in the best place.

38:57.794 --> 39:00.206
What place do you think you're in now?

39:06.803 --> 39:08.214
| don't know.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.179
| do.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.890
You're standing still.

39:15.687 --> 39:19.146
You console your children, not yourself.

39:20.650 --> 39:23.062
You can't read about your wife's killer.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.769
You can't pick her headstone.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.821
You hold yourself responsible.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.360
You're angry.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.372
I'm not dealing with any of it.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.208
No, you're not.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.926
You need to find a concrete way
to acknowledge your grief.

39:50.054 --> 39:53.263
To move on. If you don't,
you'll just be treading water.

39:53.850 --> 39:57.764
And you know what happens to someone
who treads water for too long?

39:58.646 --> 40:00.353
They drown.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.402
| have to do this on my own, Mike.

40:42.857 --> 40:45.440
Mr. Beeman, given the circumstances,

40:45.568 --> 40:47.525
would you say your treatment here
has been fair?

40:48.112 --> 40:49.364
Yes, sir.

40:49.489 --> 40:51.651
-Food sufficient?
-Yes, sir.

40:52.492 --> 40:55.029
They've protected you from other inmates?

40:56.079 --> 40:57.490
Yes, sir.

40:57.622 --> 40:58.862
Good.

40:59.582 --> 41:02.700
Because your well-being is
of paramount importance to me.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.212
Do you know why?

41:05.254 --> 41:06.119
No, sir.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.170
Because I want you to remember

41:08.299 --> 41:11.212
every single day for the rest
of your life what you took from me.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.591
The one person I lived for, my wife,

41:16.349 --> 41:21.139
mother of my children, my best friend,
the best part of me,

41:21.270 --> 41:24.228
and you did it for nothing,
for absolutely no reason.

41:27.235 --> 41:29.351
And I'm gonna do everything in my power
to make sure

41:29.487 --> 41:30.522
you think about that

41:30.655 --> 41:34.694
every day for the rest of your life.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.195
[gun cocking]

42:17.910 --> 42:19.651
We need to talk.
