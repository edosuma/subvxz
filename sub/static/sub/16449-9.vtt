00:07.424 --> 00:10.259

00:10.302 --> 00:12.803
Hey, dingdongs, we've figured out
what's happened here.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.806
You two are both named Eleanor Shellstrop.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.684
The day you died,
you were both in Phoenix, Arizona

00:18.977 --> 00:21.479
shopping at the same grocery store.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.525
The "Real Eleanor" was attending
a conference on the death penalty

00:25.734 --> 00:29.237
and you stopped by to pick up food
for a local homeless shelter.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.532
And "Fake Eleanor"
was there buying margarita mix

00:32.658 --> 00:37.411
and a magazine called
"Celebrity Baby Plastic Surgery Disasters."

00:37.913 --> 00:42.208
Incredibly, you both died
in the same ten-thousandth of a second

00:42.417 --> 00:44.544
in the same traffic accident.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.838
Because Real Eleanor was trying
to save Fake Eleanor's life

00:47.965 --> 00:50.007
by pushing you
out of the way of the truck.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.343
I guess you really botched that one, huh?

00:52.386 --> 00:55.555
I did. And I am so, so sorry.

00:56.515 --> 00:57.390
It's all good.

00:57.516 --> 01:00.268
So how did you not realise
you had the wrong Eleanor?

01:00.519 --> 01:03.896
Oh, we don't know what people
look like - only names and profiles.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.440
On Earth, they're just dots on a map.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.319
Yeah, whatever, we got our wires crossed.
We picked up the wrong dot.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.863
Bluh-Bluh-Bluh-Bluh-Bluh...
- Not now.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.865
...Bluh-Bluh-Bluh-Bluh-Bluh!

01:14.992 --> 01:17.201
Point is, there are two Eleanors.

01:17.578 --> 01:21.497
The nice, boring one is yours,
the trash bag is ours.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.417
So trash bag, let's go. Let's hit it.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.211
And also, I'm still waiting
on that smile, gorgeous.

01:27.379 --> 01:28.879
Trevor.
- Where's that smile?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.756
Trevor, how about we negotiate.
Maybe give you something else.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.593
What in the world could you have
that we would want?

01:34.261 --> 01:37.388
All right, how about a unicorn! Right?
I bet you don't have one of those.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.432
No, that is true.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.226
Might be fun to skin it alive,
eat its raw flesh

01:42.436 --> 01:44.854
maybe break off the horn,
grind it up, snort it.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.481
Okay, let's keep talking. Yeah.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.157
Fake Eleanor, a word?

01:56.283 --> 01:58.868
It's just me, man.
You can just say Eleanor.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.704
Sorry. It just makes things easier.

02:01.997 --> 02:05.374
Look, I'm not even sure how
it would work for you to stay here

02:05.542 --> 02:06.876
now that we know there's a Real Eleanor.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.962
But in the meantime, stay on your toes.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.006
Don't let Trevor get inside your head.

02:12.591 --> 02:13.549
Can I ask you something?

02:15.093 --> 02:16.469
Why are you helping me?

02:17.012 --> 02:20.389
Well, Chidi made a very good
argument on your behalf.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.682
But it's more than that.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.853
I truly believe that the
Good Place is where you belong.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.230
You're part of our team.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.403
Hi, you must be the new student,
Eleanor Shellstrop.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.781
I'm Gloria, the senior class secretary.

02:36.948 --> 02:37.865
Cool.

02:38.075 --> 02:41.410
Welcome to Adobe High,
home of the "Scorpioties!"

02:41.620 --> 02:43.496
Half the school wanted to be the Scorpions

02:43.664 --> 02:45.915
half wanted to be the Coyotes,
so we compromised.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.542
Why don't I give you
a tour after lunch?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.169
Yeah, no thanks "mop-top."

02:50.629 --> 02:51.504
Uh... sorry?

02:52.589 --> 02:56.092
Don't need your help, don't want to
sign your yearbook in, like, gel pen

02:56.134 --> 02:59.136
don't wanna bedazzle
our college essays, or whatever.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.721
I'm here for like six months

03:01.056 --> 03:02.682
and I'm gonna fly solo.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.850
Beat it, Gloria.

03:05.143 --> 03:09.271
She is like such a dork.
She, like, loves this school so much.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.773
Why don't you come sit with us?

03:10.857 --> 03:13.859
We'll teach you which guys are cute,
and which teachers are secretly "pervs."

03:13.902 --> 03:16.153
Yeah, that's a hard pass as well.

03:16.279 --> 03:19.448
I don't want to get chunky highlights,
make fun of nerds

03:19.491 --> 03:21.492
and steal your mom's flavored vodka.

03:21.660 --> 03:25.121
I get your whole "mean girl" thing,
and I'm all set with it, thanks.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.414
In fact...

03:29.960 --> 03:31.168
Listen up, everyone!

03:31.378 --> 03:33.254
I'm Eleanor, I'm new here

03:33.380 --> 03:36.382
and as a blanket statement for everyone

03:36.675 --> 03:39.385
I don't want to be a part of
whatever little group you've formed

03:39.636 --> 03:41.846
because they're all equally lame.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.806
Everybody cool? Great.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.270
Hey. It was really cool the way
you told all these poseurs...

03:49.312 --> 03:50.187
No!

03:55.193 --> 03:57.111
Tahani? Do you have a moment?

03:57.362 --> 03:58.779
Oh, Michael. Of course, come in.

03:59.656 --> 04:03.784
If I'm going to save Fake Eleanor,
I need some help negotiating.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.453
I don't even know what to offer.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.914
I mean, what do you get somebody
who wants to eat a unicorn?

04:09.666 --> 04:13.043
A unicorn bib! Yes! No. No.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.630
Unicorn holders, you know,
like corn holders, but for unicorns.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.925
But perhaps it'd be better if we just
move away from the unicorn thing altogether.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.429
No, you're right. You're right.
And anyway there's a bigger problem.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.933
The Bad Place Crew, they're all
terrible bullies, and they outnumber me.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.394
They even have their own Bad Janet.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.230
I'll show you. Bad Janet?
- What?

04:34.900 --> 04:38.235
Bad Janet, where's the nearest café?

04:38.361 --> 04:40.154
Oh, that's a good question

04:40.405 --> 04:43.365
it's up your mom's butt, you fat dink.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.995
Bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.207
That's you, Michael.
Okay, that's what you sound like.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.417
Do you hear yourself?
Do you hear him?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.462
It's gross. What is wrong with you?

04:57.172 --> 05:00.925
What is even the purpose of a Janet
who behaves in such a manner?

05:01.051 --> 05:02.927
Unclear. But the point is

05:03.553 --> 05:07.181
I never have to deal with
negative emotion of any sort.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.225
I could use some backup, Tahani.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.643
Oh, Michael, of course.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.436
Why don't you just bring them all here.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.189
Surely this magnificent house
will placate them?

05:15.273 --> 05:16.649
Oh, thank you. I'll be right...

05:19.194 --> 05:22.488
Oh, Tahani, you... you eat junk food?

05:22.739 --> 05:25.616
Oh, uh... it's my cheat day.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.744
Well, you're already dead so go nuts, right?

05:28.995 --> 05:30.079
Yes.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.373
Well, here's your house!

05:33.333 --> 05:36.919
It's beautiful.
I love Icelandic primitive design.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.548
I kinda wish it had a clown nook.
Oh! There it is!

05:40.799 --> 05:44.844
Here's the bedroom. It's kinda hard
to get up on this dumb ledge, though.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.392
You have got to be forking kidding me.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.103
Hey! Fake Eleanor,
we used this same clown painting

05:54.229 --> 05:57.022
to decorate the room you were
supposed to live in down there!

05:57.148 --> 05:58.023
I swear to Bieber!

05:58.233 --> 05:59.483
Wait, what was your house like?

06:00.026 --> 06:03.654
Well, I was living in what I assume
is Eleanor's worst nightmare.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.908
Every day was basically one endless
baby shower, for a woman I didn't know

06:08.451 --> 06:10.661
but also somehow I had to organise it?

06:10.871 --> 06:14.623
And if I didn't remember everyone's name,
I got a very strong electric shock.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.125
Yep, that was my pitch.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.003
And then at night,
it was pretty classic torture

06:19.504 --> 06:22.882
flying piranhas, lava monsters,
college improv

06:23.133 --> 06:25.426
and there was always jazz music playing.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.553
Ugh, I hate jazz!

06:27.971 --> 06:30.389
Every jazz song is forty minutes long.

06:30.432 --> 06:33.559
It's like, we get it,
you can blow on a trumpet

06:33.727 --> 06:35.227
wrap it up, Elton John!

06:35.353 --> 06:36.604
Famously a piano player.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.022
I don't mean to be a bother

06:38.064 --> 06:40.274
but could I possibly get some water

06:40.317 --> 06:43.444
and whatever food doesn't
turn to spiders in your mouth?

06:43.695 --> 06:46.447
Oh! Of course, so sorry.
Let's get some dinner.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.698
Yeah, we'll all go!

06:47.908 --> 06:51.410
Perfect double date - two losers,
a trash bag, and a demon.

06:51.703 --> 06:52.578
Let's hit it!

06:57.292 --> 07:00.044
All right, Michael, we're going to ply them
with delicious food and drink

07:00.086 --> 07:03.005
and then we're going
to subtly segue into negotiation.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.508
They're sure to be in a good mood.
Everything is absolutely beautiful.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.094
This sucks, dude.

07:09.137 --> 07:13.182
Yeah, this food uh... blows.
Yo, Good Janet!

07:13.266 --> 07:14.141
Hi there!

07:14.184 --> 07:16.894
Oh. Get me some jalapeño poppers.
- Sure.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.355
Quick question, what is a "jalapeño?"

07:19.689 --> 07:22.650
Also, what is a "poppers?"
Also, what is "jalapeño poppers?"

07:22.817 --> 07:27.988
Oops! Sorry, guys.
In the confusion, Janet got rebooted

07:28.031 --> 07:31.492
so she hasn't quite uploaded
all of the info she usually knows.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.456
That's hilarious.
She's almost as stupid as people!

07:37.916 --> 07:41.585
Oh! Hey, now, come on.
Let's not insult people, please.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.964
Ugh. You have such
a "stiffy" for human beings.

07:45.882 --> 07:49.885
"I'm Michael, I love idiot humans!"

07:51.096 --> 07:53.347
I gotta admit, that does sound like me.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.475
"I gotta admit, that does sound like me!"

07:56.977 --> 07:59.478
Nailed it again!

07:59.896 --> 08:01.855
Go get me a drink.
- Yes, of course.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.946
Ah, man, this is gonna
make a primo dump later on.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.449
Well, that looks delicious. What is that?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.201
It's Tom Yum Gong soup.

08:14.577 --> 08:18.038
It reminds me of when I was in Thailand,
rescuing victims of human trafficking.

08:18.289 --> 08:22.167
Oh, that sounds so good!
I mean, the soup, not the human trafficking.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.670
I think your grilled eggplant looks so good.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.880
- Should we...
- "Splitsies!"

08:30.301 --> 08:32.594
I can't believe you thought
you could pretend to be Real Eleanor.

08:33.054 --> 08:37.975
She's like a perfect ball of light,
and you're like a wet pile of mulch.

08:38.393 --> 08:41.145
Someone made a person
out of wet mulch and leaves

08:41.187 --> 08:43.772
and dead slugs, and that's you.

08:44.107 --> 08:47.192
Whatever. It's easy
when you're just born perfect.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.529
My parents were both "dirtbags"
who split up when I was eight.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.239
I don't mean to eavesdrop

08:52.282 --> 08:54.074
but did you say your parents got a divorce?

08:54.117 --> 08:56.660
Yeah, and that kind of thing
really changes a person.

08:56.786 --> 09:01.415
I mean, that trauma,
it can explain away a lot of behaviour.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.583
Oh, of course.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.752
Your parents are still together, I guess?

09:05.003 --> 09:09.089
Oh, actually, I'm not sure.
I never met my birth parents.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.133
They put me in an empty fish tank

09:11.259 --> 09:13.010
and abandoned me
at a train station in Bangladesh.

09:13.762 --> 09:18.348
Luckily, I was found and adopted by
a very nice couple - the Shellstrops.

09:18.767 --> 09:19.641
Oh, thank god.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.728
But then they died
when I was four - bird flu.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.980
That's awful.
- Oh, no, it wasn't that bad.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.274
Another orphan taught me
how to read and write.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.612
Although when I was nine I found out she'd
taught me a gibberish language as a prank.

09:31.863 --> 09:35.866
So I had to relearn everything from "snorf."
Sorry, scratch.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.744
Still a few gaps in my language acquisition.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.455
Anyway, the orphanage burned down,
"yadda-yadda-yadda"

09:41.498 --> 09:43.957
made my way to America,
"yadda-yadda-yadda"

09:44.375 --> 09:46.251
learned English from watching Seinfeld

09:46.294 --> 09:49.254
put myself through law school,
and here I am!

09:49.339 --> 09:52.549
Huh. I'm sorry, what is it
you said happened to you?

09:52.842 --> 09:55.344
The same thing that happens to
half of all kids in America?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.056
And for you to have gone through all that

09:59.099 --> 10:01.475
and to end up where you did,
it is just...

10:02.560 --> 10:03.769
it's just amazing.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.773
Oh man, these "horndogs"
are vibing like "mofos!"

10:07.816 --> 10:10.901
Am I right, Fake Eleanor?
- Please stop calling me that.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.153
Oh, you got it, Third Wheel.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.824
Yeah, that wine's no good
I'm sending it back.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.622
Hey, Janet!

10:24.999 --> 10:26.041
You look sad.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.336
People keep asking me questions
that I don't know the answers to.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.338
That was my whole life on Earth.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.633
You know, it doesn't matter
if you know things

10:35.009 --> 10:37.261
all that matters is what's in your heart.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.679
Thanks, Jianyu.

10:39.013 --> 10:42.516
I mean, it does matter if I know things,
because I'm an informational delivery system

10:42.934 --> 10:45.018
and I don't have a heart, but thanks.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.522
Jianyu, I know usually you ask me questions

10:48.565 --> 10:50.149
but can I ask you a question?

10:50.692 --> 10:53.360
Sure.
- What are "jalapeño poppers?"

10:53.862 --> 10:54.987
Oh! I know this one!

10:55.155 --> 10:58.157
Okay. They're deep fried jalapeños
filled with cheese.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.410
One time,
at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Jacksonville

11:01.578 --> 11:03.871
the nice one,
not the one above the gas station

11:04.122 --> 11:06.665
I ate fifty of them in two minutes.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.293
Everyone at the hospital was so impressed!

11:09.586 --> 11:11.044
Got it! Thanks, Jianyu!

11:11.379 --> 11:12.254
You're welcome!

11:17.802 --> 11:18.760
Why did you do that?

11:19.179 --> 11:22.014
Because you're the only person
here that's nice to me.

11:22.891 --> 11:23.765
Okay.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.397
Anyone up for a little icebreaker?

11:30.607 --> 11:32.608
You know, I once did trust falls
with Barry Diller

11:32.650 --> 11:34.693
and it was the beginning
of a lifelong friendship.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.570
And then, once we trust each other

11:36.613 --> 11:39.031
then we can discuss
making a deal for Fake Eleanor.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.910
This sucks! How do you guys eat
without listening to hard-core porn?

11:43.661 --> 11:46.455
Oh, come on, this is the Good Place.
You can do anything you want!

11:46.497 --> 11:50.292
What about throwing a "rager"
and totally trashing this place?

11:50.460 --> 11:52.419
Ooh! Yeah, I'd be into that.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.046
We could totally go to town.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.924
You know, I actually don't think
that's such a good idea.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.300
Let's party!

11:58.468 --> 11:59.885
<i>♪ Who let the dogs out! ♪</i>

11:59.928 --> 12:01.178
Oh my god!

12:01.304 --> 12:04.890
<i>♪ Who-who-who-who-who,
who let the dogs out! Who-who-who. ♪</i>

12:05.808 --> 12:06.975
So, um...

12:07.435 --> 12:09.519
Chidi tells me that
he's teaching you about ethics.

12:09.812 --> 12:14.107
Yeah. Actually, we've had some
interesting and in-depth classes.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.151
He taught me about
Plato and Socrates...

12:16.194 --> 12:18.445
Yeah, cool, shut up.
Let's cut to the chase, here.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.363
You two go to "Poundtown?"

12:20.573 --> 12:23.700
"Poundtown," bro!
You two bang it out? She "hot for teach'?"

12:24.202 --> 12:27.454
Did you pork the dork? Come on, girl,
dish me "dem dirty deets!"

12:27.538 --> 12:31.750
I assure you, our relationship
was "teacher-student". Nothing more.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.127
Chidi, you don't have
to explain anything to me.

12:34.337 --> 12:37.422
Whatever happened before I arrived
is none of my business.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.217
Hey, I'd love to see
the rest of the Neighborhood.

12:40.343 --> 12:43.637
Yes, it's incredible.
There's an amazing library

12:43.680 --> 12:46.723
there's a beautiful, piranha-free lake.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.810
Well, please show me everything.
You ready, Eleanor?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.438
I've seen it all already.
You guys go ahead.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.024
You'd rather be alone, with him?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.151
Fire in the hole.
Watch your heads, ladies.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.279
My dudes tend to
boomerang around the room.

13:01.114 --> 13:07.077
Yeah. I mean, I don't need to walk around and
nerd out about old books.

13:07.120 --> 13:07.995
I'm good.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.664
Okay.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.003
Hey, a bunch of us are gonna go see
"Spider-Man 2" tonight.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.045
Do you wanna come?

13:17.380 --> 13:19.089
They made a second Spider-Man?

13:19.257 --> 13:22.551
What is there left to say?
Sure, whatever, I'm in.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.887
Cool. I'll get tickets for the eight of us,
and you can just pay me back in cash.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.515
So you can get all the points
on your credit card

13:28.641 --> 13:30.892
and the rest of us get screwed?
No way!

13:30.977 --> 13:33.353
No, it's just so we can all
get tickets before they sell out.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.563
Do you want to buy them?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.941
So you guys can never pay me back and I'll be
out 80 bucks?

13:38.026 --> 13:40.902
Nice try! I'll buy my own ticket.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.613
The rest of the group
can do whatever they want.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.035
Where did she end up?

13:51.122 --> 13:54.624
Bought it with points, baby! My points!

13:57.420 --> 13:59.463
I think I need to find a new place to live.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.551
No, no, no. Don't. Don't. All right.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.555
Want a bump?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.599
No, thank you. I don't use cocaine.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.311
Oh, it's not cocaine, idiot.
We're snorting time.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.563
Sorry, you're sorting the concept of time?

14:16.814 --> 14:18.565
Yeah, it'll fork you up.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.485
Yo, monk dude.
You know how to tap a keg?

14:22.445 --> 14:24.279
Karaoke time!

14:25.281 --> 14:27.240
Dana baby, what do you want to do?

14:27.575 --> 14:29.117
Okay, a Mussolini speech?

14:29.285 --> 14:31.370
Ooh, the Mel Gibson Rant - that's a classic.

14:31.913 --> 14:35.874
Ooh let's do the Nixon Tapes.
That's my jam.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.086
<i>"What you always have to remember
with the Irish is they get mean.</i>

14:39.670 --> 14:42.255
<i>Virtually every Irish I've known
gets mean when he drinks."</i>

14:42.465 --> 14:45.008
Whoo!

14:45.385 --> 14:47.219
Michael, tell them to stop!

14:47.637 --> 14:50.097
Oh, I think I've made it pretty
clear that I don't approve.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.349
Hey, idiot! Dance!

14:52.433 --> 14:53.308
You got it!

14:53.351 --> 14:55.977
<i>"It's about damn time that
the Jew in America realises</i>

14:56.020 --> 14:58.230
<i>he's an American first
and a Jew second."</i>

14:59.148 --> 15:02.401
I lit him on fire and he never spoke again.

15:02.568 --> 15:06.154
You know, maybe I'm not
as great as Real Eleanor

15:06.280 --> 15:07.948
but I'm better than I used to be.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.700
I'm medium good.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.246
Why haven't you "forkers"
invented a medium place?

15:14.580 --> 15:18.417
Look, I know you've been trying
to become a "better" person.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.876
You didn't wanna get caught, I get it.

15:19.919 --> 15:24.131
But I read your file.
You don't belong here.

15:24.632 --> 15:28.135
She spent her weekends
breaking up dog fighting rings.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.887
You once saw a meter maid
writing you a ticket

15:30.930 --> 15:33.765
and you barked like a dog
until she ran away.

15:34.183 --> 15:37.102
You burned every bridge.
You cheated on tests.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.729
You once said
that your greatest accomplishment

15:39.772 --> 15:42.774
was inventing a new kind
of high school heavy petting.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.946
Over-the-pants mouth stuff.
That was a real game-changer.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.656
Yeah, I am a fan.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.076
I mean, honestly,
you'll be happier in the Bad Place.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.663
I mean, don't get me wrong,
you'll be miserable, we will torture you.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.290
But you'll also be happier

15:58.708 --> 16:02.836
because you won't have to keep trying
to fit in somewhere you don't belong.

16:06.716 --> 16:07.841
Aight.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.304
Let's go.
- Okay. Hold on, I have to ask.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.473
Is this thing gonna happen?
You and me?

16:14.849 --> 16:16.099
Ew, no. Gross.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.351
Okay. You know I had to ask, babe.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.733
You know it's true. You know it's true.
- No.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.319
Oh! I called it. I called it.
Did you guys go to "Poundtown?"

16:27.361 --> 16:29.905
Did it happen? Did it happen?
- No, no.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.115
We just walked through the sculpture garden

16:32.241 --> 16:34.493
reciting our favourite
Baudelaire verses to each other.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.913
Oh shut up.
- How did you guys spend your night?

16:38.164 --> 16:41.958
Oh, you know... just did a bunch of
Goldschläger shots with this demon.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.252
Well, I'm sure everyone's tired.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.046
I'm happy to sleep on the couch

16:46.464 --> 16:49.299
and Real Eleanor you can
have the guest bedroom.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.052
Oh, no, no.
I am perfectly fine on the floor.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.680
I've been sleeping on hot nails
for so long, it'll be a real treat.

16:56.641 --> 17:00.352
I'll take the couch,
Real Eleanor can take the master.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.688
No. Trevor took the master.
Oh, and he's naked.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.732
Cool.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.901
Bit of an awkward "sitch" here

17:07.944 --> 17:11.321
so you two lovebirds just do whatever

17:11.364 --> 17:12.572
and I'm gonna go sleep in the bathtub.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.449
Oh, that sounds very uncomfortable.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.577
It's cool. You should see some
of the places I've passed out drunk.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.497
My friend and I once
broke into Charles Barkley's house

17:20.540 --> 17:23.208
tried on all his giant shoes,
woke up in the garage

17:23.376 --> 17:25.794
snuck out through the doggie door
and, you know what?

17:26.087 --> 17:29.089
This story actually gets worse
from there so I'm gonna turn in.

17:29.757 --> 17:30.632
Good night.

17:31.634 --> 17:32.842
Good night.
- Good night.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.139
Oh...
- There are stairs now.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.391
Force of habit.

17:49.277 --> 17:53.947
Oh, Tahani, I'm so sorry.
I will obviously clean all of this up.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.533
I don't care about the house, Michael.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.994
I'm just upset that you
let them walk all over you.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.287
I know.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.415
They're the only thing
in the universe that scares me.

18:03.708 --> 18:04.833
I know what I have to do.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.627
I just have to be more accommodating

18:07.837 --> 18:09.337
offer them everything they want.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.048
Give in to all of their demands,
and then they'll have to respect me.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.176
No! You need to stand up for yourself.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.970
I'm going to tell you the same thing

18:17.013 --> 18:19.889
I told Mark Zuckerberg right before
he ousted Eduardo Saverin.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.058
You are smart.
You are capable

18:22.226 --> 18:24.728
and the time has come to hit "Unfriend."

18:25.229 --> 18:27.606
I also told Mark to lose the "the."

18:27.857 --> 18:30.358
You know, just "Facebook."
That was me.

18:41.162 --> 18:43.955
Oh! Oh! My head!

18:44.248 --> 18:45.874
Here. Drink this.

18:46.042 --> 18:49.210
How am I hungover? I thought
there were no hangovers here.

18:49.670 --> 18:53.632
The Bad Place Crew requested
that the hangover filter be turned off.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.843
They like them.
- Ugh. They are the worst.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.053
Yes, they are.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.847
So, Michael said we're meeting
at Tahani's place

19:00.890 --> 19:02.599
in an hour for a negotiation session.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.017
We'll walk over together?

19:05.978 --> 19:08.104
You don't have to come, man. I'm good.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.939
Just hang out with Real Eleanor

19:09.982 --> 19:14.152
and name constellations after each other,
or whatever it is nerds do.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.320
I'm fine on my own.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.531
Eleanor. Just because we have
a new guest in the house

19:18.574 --> 19:21.034
doesn't mean I'm not still going to be there
for you.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.703
I'm in this. We're a team.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.833
So, you've been temping for us for a year now

19:29.085 --> 19:30.460
and we want to bring you
aboard permanently.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.545
We think you'd be
a great addition to the team.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.256
Yeah, no, uh... I'm good.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.008
You're turning it down?

19:37.593 --> 19:41.262
I just don't think
I'm really one of you guys.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.473
You're all obsessed with this place, man.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.851
You love working here,
and talking about working here

19:47.019 --> 19:49.187
and you all hang out
like some kind of cult.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.231
We hang out after work
because we're friends.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.149
I know, it's weird!

19:53.651 --> 19:56.236
If this is how you really feel,
I think I have to fire you.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.905
Severance pay? Love it.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.156
Good looking out, boss!

20:01.742 --> 20:02.784
Peace!

20:03.494 --> 20:04.911
You need me to lie to old people

20:04.954 --> 20:07.747
and scare them into buying
fake allergy medicine, I get it, man.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.208
Which one's my desk?
- That one over there.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.502
All you gotta do is hit your
minimal sales target every week.

20:12.545 --> 20:17.966
Cool. And you guys don't have any
lame mandatory office hangouts, right?

20:18.008 --> 20:19.050
Hell no.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.052
Some people go for a drink after work

20:21.178 --> 20:24.222
and I run the occasional group drill
to see how fast we can shred evidence

20:24.390 --> 20:26.683
but that's it.
Most days you'll be able to avoid

20:26.726 --> 20:28.435
even talking to another person here.
- Perfect.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.603
Happy to be a part of the not-team!

20:30.771 --> 20:32.188
It'll be a pleasure not hanging
out with you.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.568
Alright, let's begin negotiations.

20:36.694 --> 20:40.196
Now we would like to discuss
various trades that we could make.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.364
We're not negotiating.

20:41.490 --> 20:45.034
See, Fake Eleanor and I,
we "bro'd" down pretty hard last night.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.287
We hooked up.
- No we didn't!

20:47.329 --> 20:51.583
Yeah, but who are they gonna believe,
me or a woman?

20:53.544 --> 20:57.380
Point is, she knows that she doesn't
belong here, and she's giving up.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.051
Is this true, Fake Eleanor?
Are you giving up?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.929
Yeah, of course she is.
She knows this place isn't for her.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.973
Let's go, dingdong. Come on.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.479
No. I'm not leaving.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.647
Oh, come on, sweetheart,
we've been through this.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.150
You know you don't belong here.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.860
You're right. I don't.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.323
But I want to.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.576
I used to never want
to be a part of any group.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.870
But I'm a different person now

21:29.955 --> 21:32.791
because of the person who helped me.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.001
And I want to be like him.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.670
I want to be like
all the people who are here.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.547
You can, Eleanor!

21:40.174 --> 21:41.591
Thanks, Real Eleanor!

21:42.259 --> 21:45.386
And I love that you never call me
Fake Eleanor.

21:45.721 --> 21:46.888
You really are great.

21:47.181 --> 21:50.391
Ugh. Unless you two
are gonna make out, shut up.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.519
Look, if you don't come with us

21:52.561 --> 21:55.063
we're gonna have to turn
this matter over to Shawn.

21:55.189 --> 21:57.732
Oh! Oh, no! Um... Shawn? Really?

21:57.775 --> 21:59.818
Wait, who's Shawn?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.821
He's the wise, eternal Judge,
who sits on high

22:03.447 --> 22:06.699
has the final say on all disputes
between our two realms.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.244
And his name is "Shawn?"

22:09.370 --> 22:11.871
Okay, look. I don't want
Shawn involved either.

22:11.914 --> 22:15.124
So how about you blow us away
with an offer so we can end this.

22:16.794 --> 22:17.669
Okay.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.463
Here's my offer.

22:23.509 --> 22:26.052
You get nothing!

22:26.971 --> 22:30.306
We're not letting Fake Eleanor go,
and we're not giving you anything.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.266
Get 'em, Michael!

22:31.308 --> 22:34.310
You can summon every
evil creature you have

22:34.353 --> 22:38.273
every weapon in your arsenal,
every four-headed flying bear

22:38.524 --> 22:39.399
they have them down there

22:39.859 --> 22:41.693
but we are not giving up!

22:41.944 --> 22:45.154
I believe that Eleanor
belongs in the Good Place.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.699
And if I'm wrong,
you can take her to the Bad Place

22:47.741 --> 22:50.326
and punish her all you want,
just really go to town on her!

22:50.452 --> 22:51.536
Gah! Easy, buddy. Easy.

22:51.579 --> 22:52.871
But she's staying here.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.998
Now, all of you

22:56.083 --> 22:58.042
get the fork out of my Neighbourhood.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.300
You're on borrowed time, Fake Eleanor.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.136
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Let's roll, dummies.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.513
Let's get one drink for the road.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.265
Did you guys hear any of that?

23:13.309 --> 23:14.976
Oh, my...

23:15.936 --> 23:18.146
Bravo, Michael! Really!

23:30.242 --> 23:31.576
Hello, Jianyu.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.828
You got sloppy.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.623
I found your junk food
all over the house.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.002
And then last night,
you knew how to tap a keg.

23:41.295 --> 23:45.840
So I thought I would come in here
and investigate your little "meditation den"

23:46.008 --> 23:48.176
and what I found was this.

23:49.219 --> 23:52.055
Now, I don't know who you are

23:52.556 --> 23:56.225
but I do know that you're not
a Buddhist monk.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.354
So let's chat, shall we?
