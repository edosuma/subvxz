The Chi...

00:06.970 --> 00:08.970
You want to take a few extras
to give to your neighbors?

00:09.053 --> 00:11.053
- Have you seen this girl?

00:11.136 --> 00:12.178
All right, if you--
if you hear anything,

00:12.261 --> 00:13.303

00:13.387 --> 00:14.970
- I'm Tomas.
- Jada.

00:15.053 --> 00:16.804
Maybe you'll let me
take you out for a drink.

00:16.887 --> 00:18.720
Look, Sonny closes
the place at 10:00 p.m.,

00:18.804 --> 00:20.428
and it's just sitting
empty for nine hours.

00:20.512 --> 00:21.929
I did a lot of research
and apparently, like,

00:22.011 --> 00:23.261
the after-hour joints
is the ones

00:23.345 --> 00:24.470
that's making all the money.

00:24.553 --> 00:26.261
Okay, then
let's get this money.

00:26.345 --> 00:28.929
I got a house in Kankakee
with a backyard and everything.

00:29.011 --> 00:30.303

to come live with me.

00:30.387 --> 00:33.261
- Hey, baby. Long time no see.

00:33.345 --> 00:35.428
I see your wife is helping you
on the campaign trail.

00:35.512 --> 00:36.804
Mm-hmm.

00:36.887 --> 00:38.637
Why are you running
for mayor anyway?

00:38.720 --> 00:40.845
My teacher, she asked me what
I wanted to be when I grew up,

00:40.929 --> 00:43.637
and I said I wanted to be
just like Harold Washington.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.178
She said,
"You from Englewood.

00:46.261 --> 00:48.178
You better find a trade."

00:48.261 --> 00:50.387
Voice told me
it's my destiny to find Kiesha.

00:50.470 --> 00:52.178
Let me help you
get closer to God.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.178
If you do,
maybe you can hear Him better.

00:54.261 --> 00:56.178
Kev needs your help.
I need your help.

08:53.428 --> 08:54.637
Sorry about the mess.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.470
I just wrapped up
with a few clients.

08:56.553 --> 08:58.011
And what type of business
are you in?

08:58.095 --> 09:00.804
I do hair.

09:00.887 --> 09:03.679
That outlet is
a safety hazard.

09:03.762 --> 09:05.470
- Oh, okay.

09:05.553 --> 09:08.720
- I can get that fixed.
- You're gonna have to.

09:10.553 --> 09:11.970
And what's your relationship
to Mr. Taylor?

09:12.053 --> 09:14.303
She's my wife.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.136
Your application
didn't say you were married.

09:16.220 --> 09:19.178
I mean, we're not married yet,
but she's my wife, basically.

09:19.261 --> 09:21.053
We're planning
on getting married.

09:21.136 --> 09:22.512
Well, until then,

09:22.595 --> 09:24.804
let's just say you live
with your girlfriend.

09:24.887 --> 09:26.387
Got it.

09:26.470 --> 09:29.011
Do you have a business license
to do hair in your home?

09:29.095 --> 09:31.637
I'm working on it.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.512
- What you writing?
- I'm taking notes.

09:34.595 --> 09:36.303
I mean, it just feel like
you real judgy.

09:36.387 --> 09:38.053
Every time we say something,
it's wrong, and you writing.

09:38.136 --> 09:40.679
I'm doing my job.

09:44.053 --> 09:45.970
Why we got to
do this shit anyway?

09:46.053 --> 09:47.053
Excuse me?

09:47.136 --> 09:48.428
Jake is my blood.

09:48.512 --> 09:50.303
I ain't got to
prove shit to you.

09:50.387 --> 09:51.428
You seem easily upset,
Mr. Taylor.

09:51.512 --> 09:53.136
Do you have trouble
managing your anger?

09:53.220 --> 09:54.679
Okay, here we go with
the "angry black man" shit.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.553
Just because you're his blood

09:56.637 --> 09:59.595
doesn't mean you're capable
of taking care of him.

09:59.679 --> 10:03.345
Apply for
a business license ASAP.

10:03.428 --> 10:06.178
Amend your application to say
you're living with a partner

10:06.261 --> 10:07.387
and fix the outlet.

10:07.470 --> 10:09.637
I'll see you in two weeks.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.261
Do I look different?

10:30.345 --> 10:31.428
Looking a little dusty.

10:34.595 --> 10:36.428

just died.

10:36.512 --> 10:39.845

your height.

10:43.261 --> 10:45.261

10:45.345 --> 10:47.345

10:59.553 --> 11:01.387

When I was 16 years old,
my dad caught me in drag.

26:50.595 --> 26:53.762
He pulled a knife on me
and tried to kill me.

27:02.095 --> 27:04.595
All he ever wanted was a son.
