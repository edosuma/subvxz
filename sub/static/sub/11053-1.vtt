She isn't there any more.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.612

I'm Edward Johnson, Aurora's friend.

Pleased to meet you. Vernon Dahlart.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.330
God, isn't she something?

18:03.166 --> 18:04.666
Here she comes.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.295
I met her two weeks ago at church.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.716
I guess you might say
she's God's gift to Vernon Dahlart.

- Then you like her?
- Oh, no. Does it show?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.732
Well, this is what I used to serve
when I lived in Boston.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.361
Vernon, you haven't said a word.

18:33.446 --> 18:37.532
Is that right? I feel like I haven't
stopped talking since I came in.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.994
I guess because
I've been thinking about you so much.

18:41.704 --> 18:45.332
Can I give you a suggestion
on how to handle me, Vernon?

18:45.416 --> 18:47.209
Yes, ma'am.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.086
Don't worship me until I've earned it.

18:50.171 --> 18:54.466
Thank you, ma'am.
I appreciate any advice you can give me.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.029
- I got some good news.
- What's that?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.449
I'm unofficially pregnant.

We haven't gotten the tests back yet,
but you know me. I'm never late.

Yes! Yes! Yes!"

Here I come again. Yes.

34:48.335 --> 34:52.465
Yes.

34:53.507 --> 34:57.511
Oh, God. You just made me wet.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.766
How can you do that with your voice,
just like that?

35:01.850 --> 35:04.685
You just make your voice like that.

God, if Tommy can't hear us,
we can't hear Tommy!

- Don't get pissy. I'll be right back!

This isn't love. It's selfishness.

Well, it's been almost a whole week
since we've been together.

35:54.444 --> 35:57.154
I don't think we've gone
a whole week, Flap.

35:57.239 --> 36:01.242
- Sure, we've gone a week.
- No, only in the real pregnant months.

36:01.660 --> 36:06.038
And you're always getting home so late,
Flap. Forget it. Forget it!

36:06.832 --> 36:08.332
Just do me a favour, Flap.

36:08.416 --> 36:11.126
Don't make me feel silly,
I won't make you feel guilty, all right?

36:11.211 --> 36:13.754
Fair enough. I have to hurry.

36:16.258 --> 36:17.967

Oh! I absolutely love that you came back.
You're saving our lives.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.989
You know you're saving
our lives by doing this.

36:40.073 --> 36:42.241
I love that you came back, Flap. I love it!

36:42.325 --> 36:44.702
Tommy, breakfast will be ready
in a minute. You just wait right there.

I've got to grade those papers.

'Cause I've got to get the boys off,

for me to be on the phone.

I'm all set to have
a nice, good talk with you.

Besides, you've got almost an hour
to get the boys off. What's wrong?

38:03.990 --> 38:06.909
- Nothing.
- Stop right here. Tell me what it is.

38:09.704 --> 38:13.415
Okay, Mother. I need some money.
I need you to loan me some money.

I really and truly need it, so will you?

Mother, please don't be quiet. You know
how hard that was for me to ask you.

38:21.716 --> 38:25.219
You can say no,
but please don't be quiet.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.889
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I was just thinking.

38:29.599 --> 38:30.975

that I may be pregnant again.

Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

38:46.449 --> 38:48.200
And you're going to have it, I suppose?

38:48.284 --> 38:52.705
Yes, of course.
What's happening to you, anyway?

38:52.789 --> 38:55.457
Don't act like that's so terrible, Emma.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.793
I keep hearing about
lots of bright, young women

I don't know why I tell you anything.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.303
I mean, I seem to like you
less and less, Mom.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.432
You know why, Emma?

39:11.516 --> 39:13.892
It is because I am the only person
who tells you the truth.

- All right. If the money would mean...
- No, no, don't give me the money.

- It would make you crazy.
- Yes, it would.

to take my word for it.

Just...

then you may have just sunk to a point
so low that you will never recover.

You may have just panicked, Flap,
and trying to save yourself,

you've thrown out your character
and your principles.

you could possibly redeem yourself

42:16.993 --> 42:18.911

that God intended you to be

you might have been doing last night.

you treating customers so badly.

in the mail if you like.

- To the bank?
- Sure.

47:59.085 --> 48:02.212
You could even use
a cheque-by-mail envelope.

48:02.296 --> 48:06.132
Or you could come in. Whichever.

48:07.510 --> 48:09.761
Maybe I'll come in some time.

48:12.807 --> 48:14.724
Well, that'd be fine.

- No, thanks. I'm used to this.

for a gal named Aurora Greenway.

she still takes my breath away.

as she lights up their sky.

You're the best. Happy birthday.

- Thank you, Edward.
- Excuse me, Aurora.

48:54.682 --> 48:57.684
Thank you. Do you want one, Vernon?

48:58.853 --> 49:00.854
Would you like a kiss?

49:03.482 --> 49:06.067
You're not lying about your age,
are you?

49:07.278 --> 49:08.778
Of course not.

49:08.863 --> 49:12.657
I thought you were 52. She's really 52.

49:12.742 --> 49:15.619
Come on, Aurora, how do you expect
to fool a family doctor?

49:15.703 --> 49:18.622
- It seems to me she said her age.
- Thank you, Vernon. Thank you.

49:18.706 --> 49:21.791
My point is, the number doesn't matter,
but the effort to conceal it does.

49:21.876 --> 49:24.461
- Rosie, why does he keep talking?
- Dr Ratcher...

49:24.545 --> 49:26.838
Damn it,
I'm trying to do some good here!

49:26.922 --> 49:30.216
- Now, the way to adjust to old age...
- ROSIE: Doctor.

49:30.760 --> 49:32.594
Doctor, I think you're a mite confused,

49:32.678 --> 49:34.012

Well, I was just sitting here realising...

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.460
Realising that I had
never shown you my Renoir.

all this stuff to impress girls with.

know what bothers me?

in one room, locked all the doors,

pretend that it wasn't the fun that it was.

I'm looking out the window.

I see a piece of the spacecraft,
and it's whistling along the ground.

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:27.058
It doesn't make a sound.

01:21:08.739 --> 01:21:09.781
Please, come with me.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.908
Em, Em, this is Garrett.

01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:12.992
Oh!

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:14.786
- The one...
- Pleasure to meet you.

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:16.996
I've heard so much about you.

01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:20.291
Your mother's really been
looking forward to this, too.

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:23.836
So, go ahead.

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:29.884
- Anything wrong, Garrett?
- No.

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:32.971
It was very nice to have met you.

01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:35.682
Must be nice to be home, huh?

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:37.976
Oh, it's great. It's great.

01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:40.728
I'll be over later.

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:44.607
They're probably tired anyway
and will get to sleep early,

01:21:44.692 --> 01:21:47.110
and I'd like to get to bed early.
(CHUCKLES)

TEDDY: Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:52.782
Come on. Bye-bye.

01:21:52.866 --> 01:21:55.159
ROSIE: Come on out. All right.

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.954
Whoa! This one likes to squeeze.

01:21:58.038 --> 01:22:00.748
Teddy likes to squeeze.
Tommy likes a squeeze.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:03.084
You both get a squeeze. And...

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:07.213
The baby. Where's the baby?

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:09.757
Oh!

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:12.176
There is my baby.

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:16.514
Look at the baby!

01:22:17.016 --> 01:22:18.016
Oh!

01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:20.518
EMMA: I keep thinking
she looks a little like you.

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:25.690
A little? It's like looking in the mirror.

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:30.320
EMMA: She loved the ride.
She hardly cried at all.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.448
- Mmm!
- (BABBLING)

01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:36.242
- Bring in the suitcases.
- Okay.

01:22:36.327 --> 01:22:39.203
- Mom.
- Well, I talk to you every day.

(MELANIE BABBLING)

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:45.084
- Mother, you look great.
- And you look terrible.

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:49.297
Nobody wants a girl who's washed-out
and tired-looking all the time.

01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:52.383
I just drove about 1,000 miles.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.970
Besides, all the men
love me the way I am, Mother.

01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:59.974
It's just like you that when you finally
take one small step away from Flap,

01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:03.394
it's with a married,
unavailable, older lowan.

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:11.277
- Tell me about the astronaut.
- We have to talk about it.

01:23:11.362 --> 01:23:14.572
Are you going to sleep now,
or are we gonna talk?

01:23:27.753 --> 01:23:30.254
How's the astronaut, Mother?

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.678
- Really?
- (LAUGHING)

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.263
- Oh, really?
- Yes!

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:46.187
- He has a name, though.
- You really like him.

01:23:46.939 --> 01:23:48.189
Yeah.

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:51.984
(LAUGHING)
Well, it's just so...

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:57.240
It's so strange that relatively...

01:23:58.117 --> 01:24:02.787
Relatively late in life,
I've found that sex is so...

01:24:04.123 --> 01:24:06.791
So... So...

01:24:07.835 --> 01:24:09.252
So...

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.296
So fan-fucking-tastic!

01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:16.551
Anyway, that's what he calls it.

01:24:17.845 --> 01:24:19.679

This affair is going to kill me.

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:47.123
No. Maybe not. Why do you say that?

01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:50.877
Come on, Mom.

01:24:52.171 --> 01:24:54.797

I'd start to need him.

Oh.

- Okay.

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:30.416
It was so interesting
dating Jews after the divorce.

01:25:30.501 --> 01:25:32.752
- They are so lively.
- Really?

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:34.045
Yeah.

01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:37.507
In Los Angeles, they were so anxious
to make you feel

01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:40.343
as if they understood your secret
thoughts better than anybody.

Honey, there's a telephone call for you.

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:49.852
Hello.

Oh, hi, Flap. How are you?

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:55.483
I'm fine.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:02.698
- I guess I look older, like everyone else.
- She does not.

01:26:04.243 --> 01:26:07.578
Flap, you sound the same, and I'm not
sure that's such a good thing.

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:08.663
(LAUGHS)

01:26:10.249 --> 01:26:11.415
Yeah, she's right here.

01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:16.254
No, we have not. We have other things
to talk about besides you.

What's up? Feeling contrite?

You don't seem to understand, Flap.
I saw you together.

you're doing this to us.

at Kearney, Nebraska.

I gotta go back.
We're gonna move in a week.

Emma, I don't know why
you don't leave him.

Honestly, I don't know, either. He's cute.

- Sure remembers her daddy.
- Yeah.

So, are you gonna stay mad?

I think being uprooted with my kids
without my consent

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:03.527
is at least worth a pout, don't you?

Come on.

- Aurora?
- Garrett! I'm back here.

Well, hello, stranger.
What's it been, about two days?

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:34.558
GARRETT: Your family still around?

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.311
No, they left.

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:42.900
What?

01:28:56.832 --> 01:29:00.209
You probably know
what I'm going to say.

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:05.464
Maybe not. I hope not.

01:29:10.429 --> 01:29:11.429
Well...

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:18.811
You're some kind of woman,
but I'm the wrong kind of man,

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:24.108
and it doesn't look like my shot
at being the right kind is

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:26.861
as good as I was hoping for.

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:33.743
You don't even know
how much you're gonna miss me.

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:37.872
I don't want to blow smoke up your ass.

Oh.

(CHUCKLES)
What a relief.

01:29:43.503 --> 01:29:46.964
It's just that I'm starting
to feel an obligation here.

01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:51.927
And it makes it rough,
especially living next door.

01:29:52.304 --> 01:29:55.848
I'm starting to think
I gotta watch what I'm doing...

01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:57.808
Blah, blah, blah, blah...

I am gonna miss you.

01:30:16.286 --> 01:30:18.162
And I do feel bad.

01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:24.418
You're lucky.

01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:28.672
I feel humiliated.

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:56.325
Can I have a picture of you?

01:30:56.409 --> 01:30:59.537
Well, yeah, but the only one I have
has Flap in it.

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:01.038
I don't mind.

01:31:01.248 --> 01:31:02.248
(CHUCKLES)

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:24.019
Come here. Give me a kiss.

01:31:57.262 --> 01:32:00.639
When you finish this, I need this
kind of type or something close.

01:32:00.724 --> 01:32:03.058
- Hello, Emma. Hi, baby.
- Hi.

01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:06.437
She wanted her daddy
to see her dressed up

01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:07.521
before she went to the doctor.

01:32:07.606 --> 01:32:09.023
He'll be here any minute.

01:32:09.107 --> 01:32:11.233
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

01:32:14.988 --> 01:32:16.614
Excuse me.

01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:30.085
- Miss?
- Miss?

01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:42.806
Don't make me run after you.
I have a toddler here!

01:33:01.201 --> 01:33:02.201
(GRUNTS)

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:11.835
Are you the reason
that we came to Nebraska?

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.297
I think that Flap should talk to you.

01:33:15.382 --> 01:33:17.258
We discussed that.

01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:21.637
I don't want to say anything
until he does, except that

01:33:21.721 --> 01:33:26.183
I don't think there's an emotion
that you're having I couldn't validate.

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:27.601
(SCOFFS)

01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:35.442
Tell you what.

01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:39.029
If you see Flap,
you tell him that his wife and his baby

01:33:39.114 --> 01:33:41.615
went to the doctor's
to get their flu shots, all right?

01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:43.701
Why don't you do that?

01:33:48.832 --> 01:33:50.040
DR BUDGE: Just hold still.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:53.210
- That's a good girl.
- Ow!

EMMA: Okay? You're all finished,
all right? It's all over.

01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:03.178
If it makes you feel any better,
Mommy's gonna get a shot, too.

01:34:03.263 --> 01:34:05.764
- Can I give her one of those?
- Sure.

01:34:05.849 --> 01:34:08.684
- Here.
- There you go.

01:34:10.687 --> 01:34:14.690
Are they gonna tell me in the other room
if my husband calls?

01:34:15.358 --> 01:34:17.735
You have a lump in your armpit.

01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:20.696
- How long has it been there?
- I don't know.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:22.781
Melanie, stop kicking the cabinet!

01:34:22.866 --> 01:34:26.118
There's two of them.
It's not very big, though.

01:34:27.412 --> 01:34:30.539
I have to be out of town next week,
and I hate to make it wait that long.

01:34:30.623 --> 01:34:32.833
They should come out and be looked at.

01:34:32.917 --> 01:34:35.085
Come out? Should I be scared?

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:38.714
All it means is, if you're scared, why,

01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:40.883
you'll be that much happier
when it turns out to be nothing.

01:34:40.967 --> 01:34:45.637
Dr Budge, Mom should get a pop, too,
for her shot.

01:34:46.806 --> 01:34:49.892
- (CHUCKLING) Right. Here, Mom.
- Thanks, Mel.

01:34:50.894 --> 01:34:52.311
Well, I know what it is.

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:55.606
You don't know how to keep yourself up,
so your sweat glands have clogged up.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:58.400
- It's a cyst.
- So I shouldn't worry, right?

01:34:58.485 --> 01:34:59.860
It's a cyst.

01:34:59.944 --> 01:35:02.279
It's right where your oil glands are,
and they've clogged up.

01:35:02.364 --> 01:35:05.115
You never did know how to eat right,
and you've never learned how to wash.

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.494
You're right. You're right. Thanks.
Talk to Melanie.

01:35:08.578 --> 01:35:09.703
- Say hi.
- Hi.

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:13.499
Hello, how are you? I sent you a blouse.

MELANIE: Bye.

01:35:15.752 --> 01:35:19.421
Okay. Say good...
Say goodbye to your mother.

01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:32.851
- What's her name?
- Janice. What did the doctor say?

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:35.229
I told you, Flap.

01:35:35.313 --> 01:35:38.232
The scariest thing about it
is that he wants to do it so fast.

01:35:38.316 --> 01:35:40.984
Janice. With her little folder
under her arm.

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:45.864
"I can't say anything until he does.
We've discussed it, Flap and I."

01:35:45.949 --> 01:35:50.244
I mean, really, Flap!
"Validate my feelings". Your taste!

01:35:50.328 --> 01:35:53.372
But that thing that the doctor said
about feeling good when it turns out...

01:35:53.456 --> 01:35:54.790
No! No, no. Forget about it.

01:35:54.874 --> 01:35:56.875
I'm not gonna make you feel better.
I'm too mad.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.377
(SHOUTING)
Dinner!

01:36:14.185 --> 01:36:17.521
- (SIGHS) Dear, you have a malignancy.
- Malignancy.

01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:26.905
- Say it again?
- Malignancy.

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:31.618
Rosie.

01:36:33.163 --> 01:36:35.372
Rosie, our girl is in trouble.

01:36:35.457 --> 01:36:38.333
She had a cyst, a kind of a cyst,
and it turned out to be malignant.

01:36:38.418 --> 01:36:42.963
And they're going to take her
to a hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska.

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.221
We'll release her in a few days.

01:36:51.306 --> 01:36:54.099
We do more and more
on an outpatient basis.

01:36:55.351 --> 01:36:59.313
We shouldn't need to take her back
here at all unless the illness escalates.

01:36:59.397 --> 01:37:03.400
- But you're not telling me anything.
- What are you confused about?

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.653
How is she?

01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:10.240
I always tell people to hope for the best
and prepare for the worst.

01:37:12.535 --> 01:37:15.829
And they let you get away with that?

01:37:15.914 --> 01:37:18.373
Look, you're wrong to take the attitude

01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:20.834
that everything is so desperate
and serious now.

01:37:20.919 --> 01:37:24.421
And it won't do your daughter
any good to get those signals, either.

01:37:30.762 --> 01:37:32.429
What's wrong now?

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:37.226
I am so frustrated with that doctor.
But it all boils down to this.

01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:40.687
You're getting out of here tomorrow,
and you don't have to stay here again.

01:37:40.772 --> 01:37:44.942
Unless the illness spreads.
I really don't feel sick.

01:37:45.485 --> 01:37:49.279
Emma. I want you to come to New York
for a visit. My treat.

01:37:50.573 --> 01:37:52.533
Great. I mean, we'll have to see.

You guys have to see
these letters from the kids.

Look, Teddy says that he couldn't sleep
at all, but Melanie slept fine.

01:37:58.998 --> 01:38:03.210
Tommy says that he really doesn't think
there's anything to be concerned about.

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:07.130
Hey, I mean it! You have some time
before you have to see the doctor again.

01:38:07.215 --> 01:38:09.716
Come see New York for a few days.

01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:13.887
I don't think it's a bad idea,
have a vacation by yourself.

Rosie and I are here with the kids.

01:38:16.182 --> 01:38:18.976
- Take advantage of your freedom.
- I know you wanna go.

01:38:22.021 --> 01:38:26.024
This isn't like when they take those kids
to Disneyland right before the end?

- Ow!

- Patsy, I'm kidding!

Okay. Okay.

01:38:36.035 --> 01:38:38.453
Do you feel funny
about leaving the kids?

01:38:38.538 --> 01:38:42.291
I'm not leaving them.
I'm entrusting them to their father.

01:38:43.626 --> 01:38:47.421
Oh, I thought as long as your mother
and Rosie are in town...

01:38:47.505 --> 01:38:49.840
Not them. You.

- Are we there yet?

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:09.026
- Oh, God! I can't believe I'm here!
- Isn't it beautiful?

01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:11.111
Hey, I want you to meet
some of my friends.

Isn't that what I said?

No, you said "Elizabeth" with an "E".
It's Lizbeth.

- Two names? Liz Beth?
- No, no, one. Lizbeth.

- Lizbeth?
- Never mind.

01:39:35.887 --> 01:39:38.972
- And this is Jane.
- Thank heavens!

Yeah, don't think she doesn't know it.

in school before you go back to work?

Oh, I never really worked.

It was a great honour
meeting you, Emma.

- Bye, darling.

- You told them, didn't you?
- You don't mind, do you?

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.137
Of course not.

01:41:02.223 --> 01:41:05.100
Emma, come on. They're jerks.
They don't know anything.

have to act like that?

Emma, talk to me!

It's not you, Patsy. I don't care.
I don't mind them knowing.

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:20.532
In less than two hours, two of them
told me that they'd had abortions.

01:41:21.284 --> 01:41:23.744
Three of them told me
they were divorced.

- Have you seen her yet today?
- Yes.

01:51:49.578 --> 01:51:53.122
I've been with her most of
last night and today, as usual.

01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:58.795
I haven't really talked to the kids yet.

01:52:00.798 --> 01:52:02.215
I'm not sure how much they realise,

01:52:02.299 --> 01:52:05.468
but they know
something bad is happening.

01:52:06.303 --> 01:52:07.303
Flap.

01:52:08.472 --> 01:52:11.849
Patsy wants to raise Melanie
and maybe the boys.

01:52:12.518 --> 01:52:16.270
I think they should be with me,
don't you?

01:52:16.355 --> 01:52:19.273
What can you be thinking about?

01:52:19.358 --> 01:52:23.069
Raising three children,
working full time and chasing women

01:52:23.153 --> 01:52:25.988
requires a lot more energy
than you have.

01:52:26.073 --> 01:52:27.949
You know, one of the
nicest qualities about you

01:52:28.033 --> 01:52:31.536
has always been that you recognised
your weaknesses.

01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:34.455
Don't lose that quality now
when you need it the most.

01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:44.924
You have no right nor any invitation

01:52:45.008 --> 01:52:50.012
to discuss where
or how my children live.

01:53:09.074 --> 01:53:12.869
From what the doctor says,
it's time that we have the talk now.

01:53:14.204 --> 01:53:17.540
Do you know how much I hate
the idea of losing you?

01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:21.377
Yes.

01:53:22.713 --> 01:53:27.592
Well, nobody...
Nobody seems to know that except you.

01:53:29.344 --> 01:53:32.138
- I... Well...
- What?

01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:36.142
(CHUCKLES) I'm thinking
about my identity

01:53:36.226 --> 01:53:38.352
and not having one any more. I mean...

01:53:38.437 --> 01:53:40.813
Who am I, if I'm not the man
who's failing Emma?

01:53:41.190 --> 01:53:44.942
- You didn't fail me, Flap.
- I don't wanna talk about this.

01:53:45.027 --> 01:53:48.237
I feel like I'm sucking after forgiveness,
which I probably am.

01:53:49.531 --> 01:53:52.158
You were no more terrible than I was.

01:53:52.242 --> 01:53:53.784
No. Except for the cheating.

01:53:56.622 --> 01:53:58.956
You're right. Let's not do this.

01:54:01.502 --> 01:54:03.002
Look, we had problems.

01:54:03.086 --> 01:54:06.130
It was never over
whether we loved each other.

01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:15.598
Oh, God! That tie!
I can't believe you wore that!

01:54:16.308 --> 01:54:18.768
God, the mess it must've been
for you to find it.

01:54:18.852 --> 01:54:23.731
The house still isn't in one piece.
It was in the last box I looked in.

01:54:23.815 --> 01:54:25.149
(LAUGHING) I'll bet.

01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:29.445
God, you're easy to please.

01:54:31.114 --> 01:54:33.783
I don't know why I couldn't do more of it.

01:54:34.826 --> 01:54:37.787
I'm so glad we're talking, I just am.

01:54:38.956 --> 01:54:42.333
It just means so much to me that
we can still feel like this, so much.

01:54:43.126 --> 01:54:44.627
I swear...

01:54:48.715 --> 01:54:50.800
Listen, I am getting tired.

01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:56.097
Just tell me, hon,
you really want to raise 'em?

01:55:09.486 --> 01:55:13.614
I never thought I was the sort of man
who'd give up his kids.

01:55:13.699 --> 01:55:15.366
It's a lot of work.

01:55:17.244 --> 01:55:21.330
As hard as you think it is,
you end up wishing it were that easy.

01:55:24.209 --> 01:55:26.043
Where do you want them?

01:55:26.128 --> 01:55:28.796
I don't want them to end up with Janice.

01:55:31.216 --> 01:55:32.967
Well, she's not so bad.

01:55:39.016 --> 01:55:42.435
I really don't think
they should be with you, honey.

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:53.362
Well, to tell you the honest truth,

01:55:56.533 --> 01:55:58.159
I'd probably screw it up.

01:56:02.664 --> 01:56:04.373
I'll really miss them.

01:56:10.714 --> 01:56:13.299
Well, maybe we should let
Patsy take them.

01:56:13.383 --> 01:56:17.720
Because it'd be very easy for me
to work research summers in New York.

01:56:17.804 --> 01:56:22.725
No. Patsy really only wants Melanie.
Mother should have them.

01:56:24.645 --> 01:56:26.646
You can see them any time you want.

01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:29.315
Y'all will decide things
for them and everything.

01:56:29.399 --> 01:56:32.652
- Emma, she can make that very difficult.
- She won't.

01:56:35.822 --> 01:56:36.822
(SIGHS)

01:56:37.824 --> 01:56:41.577
Well, (CLEARS THROAT) I guess
they should be with your mother.

01:56:43.705 --> 01:56:45.581
I probably have that coming.

01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:47.750
(LAUGHING)

01:56:56.593 --> 01:56:57.593
EMMA: Oh!

01:57:04.184 --> 01:57:07.061
Flap, will you bring
the boys by tomorrow?

01:57:08.063 --> 01:57:12.024
I've got that one waiting for me.
I gotta do it.

01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:14.610
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

01:57:25.914 --> 01:57:28.749
EMMA: Come on, Pats. I gotta get ready.

01:57:28.834 --> 01:57:31.502
Patsy. Make-up!

01:57:31.795 --> 01:57:33.254
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:57:35.674 --> 01:57:38.884
Is it terrible for me to say that
I can't stand seeing your mother

01:57:38.969 --> 01:57:40.594
get her hands on that little girl?

01:57:40.679 --> 01:57:43.472
I'd just love to raise that little girl.

01:57:49.604 --> 01:57:52.982
Look, I'd let you,
but Teddy couldn't spare her.

01:57:53.066 --> 01:57:54.066
(SOBS)

01:57:55.235 --> 01:57:57.737
I can't stall any more, all right?

01:57:57.821 --> 01:58:00.656
You go out there and send the boys in.

01:58:01.575 --> 01:58:04.326
- Well, do I get to say something ever?
- No.

01:58:05.495 --> 01:58:06.829
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:11.333
We don't have to do that, right?
Come here.

01:58:16.256 --> 01:58:18.799
You'll be fine. You will.

01:58:24.848 --> 01:58:26.849
(VOICE BREAKING)
It's just this.

01:58:28.018 --> 01:58:29.018
(SOBS)

01:58:30.061 --> 01:58:32.146
You're my touchstone, Emma.

01:58:34.816 --> 01:58:36.025
The boys.

01:59:12.145 --> 01:59:13.604
(BED WHIRRING)

01:59:19.277 --> 01:59:22.071
Hi. Come on.

01:59:23.657 --> 01:59:26.992
I love you. I miss you.
God, I want you to come home.

01:59:28.578 --> 01:59:30.788
Close the door.

01:59:30.872 --> 01:59:33.582
Guys, you both look so gigantic to me.

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:38.587
- I guess I look pretty bad to you.
- Not so bad.

01:59:43.301 --> 01:59:47.137
You both have beautiful eyes,
and your hair's too long.

01:59:47.222 --> 01:59:50.641
I don't care how long it gets in the back,
but keep your bangs cut, okay?

01:59:50.725 --> 01:59:53.561
- It's too long.
- That's a matter of opinion.

01:59:54.896 --> 01:59:57.523
Just keep it short, all right?

01:59:57.607 --> 01:59:58.983
Are you getting well?

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:01.026
Mmm-mmm.

02:00:03.196 --> 02:00:04.280
Look up.

02:00:05.699 --> 02:00:07.867
I'm sorry about this, but I can't help it.

02:00:07.951 --> 02:00:11.745
And I can't talk to you for too long,
or I'll get real upset.

02:00:13.623 --> 02:00:16.125
I want you to make a lot of friends.

02:00:17.127 --> 02:00:19.587
And I want you to be real nice
to the girls,

02:00:19.671 --> 02:00:22.673
'cause they're going to be
real important to you, I swear.

02:00:22.757 --> 02:00:26.427
We're not afraid of girls.
What makes you think that?

02:00:26.511 --> 02:00:29.430
- Well, you may be later on.
- I doubt it.

02:00:29.514 --> 02:00:32.558
- Why don't you shut up? Shut up!
- You shut up.

02:00:33.018 --> 02:00:35.436
Teddy, give me a kiss. Come on.

02:00:39.482 --> 02:00:42.276
Tommy, you be sweet. Be sweet.

02:00:44.321 --> 02:00:48.282
And stop trying to pretend
like you hate me. I mean, it's silly.

02:00:49.618 --> 02:00:50.826
I like you.

02:00:51.494 --> 02:00:53.662
Okay, then will you
listen especially close?

02:00:53.747 --> 02:00:54.747
What?

02:00:54.831 --> 02:00:56.916
- You'll listen real hard?
- I said, "What?"

02:00:59.836 --> 02:01:02.254
I know you like me. I know it.

02:01:04.341 --> 02:01:08.135
For the last year or two, you've been
pretending like you hate me.

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:13.849
I love you very much.
I love you as much as I love anybody,

02:01:14.643 --> 02:01:16.685
as much as I love myself.

02:01:17.354 --> 02:01:19.563
And in a few years,
when I haven't been around

02:01:19.648 --> 02:01:21.607
to be on your tail about something
or irritating you,

02:01:21.691 --> 02:01:23.943
you're gonna remember.

02:01:24.027 --> 02:01:26.111
You're gonna remember that time
I bought you the baseball glove

02:01:26.196 --> 02:01:31.367
when you thought we were too broke,
or when I read you those stories,

02:01:31.451 --> 02:01:36.038
or when I let you goof off instead of
mowing the lawn, lots of things like that.

02:01:37.165 --> 02:01:40.125
And you're gonna realise
that you love me,

02:01:40.210 --> 02:01:44.505
and maybe you're gonna feel badly
because you never told me, but don't.

02:01:47.676 --> 02:01:49.218
I know that you love me.

02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:54.682
So don't ever do that
to yourself, all right?

02:01:54.766 --> 02:01:55.849
Okay.

02:01:57.394 --> 02:01:59.728
- Okay?
- I said, "Okay."

02:02:03.775 --> 02:02:07.194
Okay, you two should run along.
Take care.

02:02:09.864 --> 02:02:11.365
Give me a kiss.

02:02:15.245 --> 02:02:18.789
I was so scared,
but I think it went really well, don't you?

02:02:21.251 --> 02:02:22.334
Yeah?

02:02:35.432 --> 02:02:38.976
Tommy, if you need to talk,
your dad will listen.

02:02:39.853 --> 02:02:42.855
He's a very smart man, you know.

02:02:42.939 --> 02:02:44.356
All you have to do is
go up to him and say,

02:02:44.441 --> 02:02:47.151
"Dad, I'm confused.
I need to have a talk."

02:02:51.781 --> 02:02:55.659
You know, I met this boy
back in River Oaks where I live.

02:02:55.744 --> 02:02:59.121
He was telling me that the Cub Scouts
in Houston are the best ever.

02:02:59.205 --> 02:03:03.125
We were never Scouts. Our mother
was too lazy to check it out.

02:03:05.378 --> 02:03:07.212
No! Stop!

02:03:08.506 --> 02:03:10.340
Come on! Stop it!

02:03:10.425 --> 02:03:11.592
No!

02:03:12.052 --> 02:03:15.929
Listen to me! Listen. It's okay, Tom.

02:03:16.264 --> 02:03:19.975
It's okay. Now... Hey! Stop it!

02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:26.106
I'm sorry, but I just can't have you
criticising your mother around me.

02:03:30.153 --> 02:03:31.528
(TOMMY SOBBING)

02:04:38.138 --> 02:04:42.599
Mr Horton. Mr Horton? She's gone.

02:04:59.409 --> 02:05:01.034
(STIFLED SOBBING)

02:05:10.795 --> 02:05:14.756
Oh, God, I'm so stupid. So stupid.
Somehow I thought...

02:05:15.884 --> 02:05:18.719
Somehow I thought
when she finally went,

02:05:18.803 --> 02:05:20.888
(SOBBING)
That it would be a relief.

02:05:22.765 --> 02:05:25.767
Oh, my sweet, little darling!

02:05:33.193 --> 02:05:37.279
Oh, dear. There's nothing harder.
There's nothing...

02:05:49.125 --> 02:05:50.584
Do you want some cake?

02:06:07.018 --> 02:06:10.646
- Why are you standing over here?
- I don't know.

02:06:12.523 --> 02:06:15.567
Come on. You wanna come over
and sit with me?

02:06:21.241 --> 02:06:23.951
Everything's gonna be all right, Tommy.

02:06:41.344 --> 02:06:45.889
There's fantastic dance schools
in Houston.

02:06:46.599 --> 02:06:51.270
- Tap?
- Tap, ballet, aerobics.

02:06:52.730 --> 02:06:56.692
Anything you want.
Come over here and see your dad.

02:06:56.776 --> 02:06:59.653
He really knows a pretty girl,
doesn't he?

02:07:00.321 --> 02:07:02.322
She's too old for him.

02:07:02.407 --> 02:07:07.369
Are you eating away at bunny? Here.
Better go on over to Dad and eat it.

02:07:18.881 --> 02:07:22.009
Hi, Vern. How are you doing here?

02:07:49.871 --> 02:07:52.080
I understand you're a swimmer.

02:07:53.958 --> 02:07:57.419
- Me, too.
- But you're an astronaut, right?

02:07:58.838 --> 02:08:01.131
I'm an astronaut and a swimmer.

02:08:06.095 --> 02:08:07.596
Pretty good-looking suit, there.

02:08:09.724 --> 02:08:12.100
A little closer. A little closer.

02:08:13.561 --> 02:08:15.103
A little closer.

02:08:15.605 --> 02:08:17.773
Do you want to see my pool?

02:08:18.983 --> 02:08:23.528
Well, I don't know if the time is right.
You know, funeral and everything.

02:08:23.613 --> 02:08:27.032
I think it is. Come on.

02:08:27.116 --> 02:08:32.162
I'll show you the internationally
infamous Breedlove crawl.

02:08:33.623 --> 02:08:36.958
Just a little stroke
I picked up out in space.
