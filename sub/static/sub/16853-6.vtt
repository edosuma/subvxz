08:48.164 --> 08:48.829
Owen: Okay.

08:48.898 --> 08:50.531
Let me try to break this down for you.

08:50.566 --> 08:52.599
You see that hitting other
kids with sticks is wrong.

08:52.634 --> 08:53.733
Richard: Yeah, absolutely.

08:53.769 --> 08:56.436

08:59.474 --> 09:01.808
I see what you're talking about, Owen.

09:01.843 --> 09:03.610
Oh, Richard, you're horrible.

09:03.645 --> 09:04.544
I'm so sorry.

09:04.579 --> 09:06.446
I just got seduced by the money.

09:06.481 --> 09:07.747
I mean, feel this coat.

09:07.816 --> 09:08.648
Lacey: Oh, wow!

09:08.683 --> 09:11.017
Richard: What's the point of
replacing my heart if you're

09:11.086 --> 09:12.652
just gonna tear it up again, Lola?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.354
Lola: Richard, we gave you an
organ that pumps blood, but you

09:15.390 --> 09:17.090
don't have a heart.

09:17.158 --> 09:19.793
Richard: Okay. I get it.

09:19.828 --> 09:21.828
I bid you all farewell, then.

09:21.896 --> 09:22.995
It was nice meeting you all.

Ooh!

09:31.873 --> 09:32.572
Lola: What?!

09:32.641 --> 09:33.473
Sy: Well, okay.

09:33.508 --> 09:34.473
So, they were hugging.

09:34.509 --> 09:34.940
Just hugging.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.642
Carrie: [ Muffled ] I'm in here!

09:36.711 --> 09:38.110
Lola: All right, all right.

09:38.179 --> 09:39.645
Step back. I got this one.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.113

09:55.029 --> 09:56.395
Carrie: Disgusting.

09:56.464 --> 09:57.029

on that helper animal.

a pretty good team.

10:01.569 --> 10:02.201
Lacey: Yeah?

10:02.236 --> 10:04.136
Owen: I'm almost sorry
we can't be together.

10:04.205 --> 10:05.571
Lacey: Oh, we're together.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.740
I had us married during
the recopping ceremony.

Blake: Hey, was that dot-com
billionaire Richard Jarvis I saw

10:10.611 --> 10:11.944

10:11.979 --> 10:12.845
Lacey: Oh.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.480
We should have arrested that guy.

10:14.549 --> 10:15.114

10:15.149 --> 10:16.649
Lacey: Endangerment, kidnapping.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.217
Owen: Conspiracy, fraud,
attempted murder.

10:18.252 --> 10:20.586
Blake: And now we'll never know
where he's been hiding that
