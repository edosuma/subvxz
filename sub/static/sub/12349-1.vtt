give me another lecture,

a good night's sleep

03:13.193 --> 03:14.560

03:18.865 --> 03:21.166

- That's preposterous.
- No, that's libel.

The man was guilty.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.012
Not according to the jury!

03:34.113 --> 03:35.847
That's because the judge
threw out half the evidence.

It doesn't change the fact
that the man was exonerated!

03:38.451 --> 03:40.252
He had expensive lawyers.

Yeah, and now those same

- Oh, really? Why is that?

Then I saw a new heaven
and a new earth,

05:02.368 --> 05:07.039
for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.742
And I heard a loud voice
from the throne saying,

05:10.843 --> 05:15.514
"Behold, the dwelling place
of God is with man.

05:15.615 --> 05:18.583
He will dwell with them,
and they will be His people."

05:18.685 --> 05:21.820
25 years
after her husband James

05:21.921 --> 05:23.989
was taken from us
in a boat accident,

05:24.090 --> 05:26.525
Catherine now stands
at the gates of heaven.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.760
And as the Bible says,

05:28.861 --> 05:31.129
"He will wipe away every tear
from their eyes,

05:31.230 --> 05:34.132
and death shall be no more,

05:34.233 --> 05:38.303
neither shall there be mourning
nor crying

05:38.404 --> 05:39.871
nor pain anymore,

05:39.972 --> 05:42.140
for the old things
have passed away."

05:42.241 --> 05:45.077
So let us take this time
not to mourn Catherine,

05:45.178 --> 05:46.878

18:47.042 --> 18:48.910
He deserves to know
what happened.

18:49.011 --> 18:52.013
Are you sure
that's what this is about?

18:52.114 --> 18:55.550
It has nothing to do with
finding out more information

18:55.651 --> 18:57.385
about the secret man
in her life?

18:57.486 --> 19:00.721
I get it. I do. I know what
it's like to lose parents.

19:00.823 --> 19:04.559
My dad was a fireman.
He died when I was young.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.561
My mom passed away
when I was deployed.

19:06.662 --> 19:08.129
I'm sorry.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.332
If there was information
I could find out about them,

19:11.433 --> 19:14.635
something I didn't know,
I'd feel exactly the same way.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.370
So you'll do it?

19:17.873 --> 19:19.607
I'll try.

19:19.708 --> 19:22.176
There's not a lot to go on,
but I can give it shot.

19:22.277 --> 19:26.280
The least I can do is
run the card for prints.

19:26.381 --> 19:27.815
Can I borrow those?

19:27.916 --> 19:29.684
Sure.

19:35.524 --> 19:38.426
Oh, no, please.
Drink's on me.

19:40.896 --> 19:43.831
Well, it was a pleasure
meeting you, Ms. Clark.

19:43.932 --> 19:47.001
I'll call you
when I have something.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.803
Bye.

19:52.708 --> 19:54.442
[line ringing]

19:54.543 --> 19:55.543
Yeah, it's me.

19:55.644 --> 19:58.246
Yeah, she just left.

21:15.624 --> 21:18.626
- [ringing continues]
- Hold on.

21:29.805 --> 21:30.838
Hi.

21:30.939 --> 21:33.407
Hey. I brought breakfast.

21:33.508 --> 21:35.643
I don't remember telling you
where I live.

21:35.744 --> 21:37.645
I'm a P.I., remember?

21:37.746 --> 21:39.914
Ah. That's creepy.

21:40.015 --> 21:41.315
And Logan told me.

21:41.416 --> 21:42.450
Figures.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.552
Mind if I come in?

21:44.653 --> 21:47.288
Which way is the kitchen?

21:47.389 --> 21:50.024
Please. Help yourself.

21:53.095 --> 21:55.329
Sorry. The place is
a bit of a mess.

21:55.430 --> 21:57.398
I wasn't expecting company.

21:57.499 --> 22:00.668
Don't worry. Just relax.
I'll take care of everything.

22:00.769 --> 22:02.603
Do you have a percolator?

22:02.704 --> 22:03.637
A what?

22:03.739 --> 22:05.272
How about a kettle?

22:05.374 --> 22:07.641
You know, a big metal object
you boil water with?

22:07.743 --> 22:08.943
I don't know.

22:09.044 --> 22:10.144
Do you ever cook?

22:10.245 --> 22:11.612
[chuckles]

22:11.713 --> 22:13.381
Of course you don't.
[laughs]

22:15.217 --> 22:19.086
So I was able to run those cards
you gave me for fingerprints.

22:19.187 --> 22:20.354
Did you find one?

22:20.455 --> 22:22.089
I found too many, actually.

22:22.190 --> 22:24.325
Your mom, the mailman,
the mail sorter.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.127
It'd be impossible
to match them all.

22:26.228 --> 22:29.930
But I was able to find out
where they were sent from.

22:30.032 --> 22:32.433
- Oh?
- Yeah, I used the...

22:32.534 --> 22:34.568
the postmark
on the envelope.

22:34.669 --> 22:37.438
I traced it to this place called
the Hadleyville Postal Place.

22:37.539 --> 22:40.141
It's like one of these
private PO box-type places.

22:40.242 --> 22:42.009
And guess what.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.045
There happens to be a card store
right next door.

22:44.146 --> 22:46.280
You have coffee?

22:46.381 --> 22:47.715
Oh, just up there.

22:47.816 --> 22:50.551
And so I checked,

22:50.652 --> 22:54.121
and it turns out that they're
the only one in the area

22:54.222 --> 22:55.156
that sells that brand of card.

22:55.257 --> 22:56.857
Oh, really.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.793
Of course they don't remember
anything specifically

22:58.894 --> 23:00.061
about the customers,

23:00.162 --> 23:01.729
but when I mentioned
the calligraphy,

23:01.830 --> 23:03.831
they say there's this woman
at the postal place

23:03.932 --> 23:05.533
who's known for doing
address labels.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.536
Wow. So now what?

23:08.637 --> 23:10.905
I think we should go up there.

23:11.006 --> 23:13.841
Show her the cards and see
if she remembers any of them.

23:13.942 --> 23:17.178
You mean go to Hadleyville?
It's four hours away.

23:17.279 --> 23:19.013
You want to solve
the mystery, right?

23:19.114 --> 23:20.347
Wanna find out
who sent the cards?

23:20.449 --> 23:22.683
I was hoping for
an address or an email

23:22.784 --> 23:25.519
so I could let them know
what happened to my mom.

23:25.620 --> 23:26.821
Maybe even a photo.

23:26.922 --> 23:28.422
You're an investigative
reporter.

23:28.523 --> 23:29.723
You should live
for a good mystery.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.625
It's almost Christmas.

23:31.726 --> 23:33.861
I'm still trying to deal
with my mom's estate.

23:33.962 --> 23:35.696
I'm cleaning this place
so I can sell it,

23:35.797 --> 23:37.298
and I can't just leave.

23:37.399 --> 23:41.035
Look, I promise.
I'll have you back by the 25th.

23:41.136 --> 23:43.404
You wanna find this guy,
wanna tell him what happened,

23:43.505 --> 23:45.206
you're gonna have to go
to Hadleyville.

23:45.307 --> 23:49.710
And maybe you can get some
answers while you're there too.

23:49.811 --> 23:51.712
I better go
get dressed then.

23:51.813 --> 23:53.881
All right, great.
Why don't you pack,

23:53.982 --> 23:55.382
and I'll get the coffees to go.

23:55.484 --> 23:56.984
Okay, just one night.

23:57.085 --> 23:58.319
Yeah, of course.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.221
Oh, Rebecca, one more thing.

24:00.322 --> 24:01.489
Yes?

24:01.590 --> 24:03.657
How do you feel about dogs?

24:05.227 --> 24:07.595
Oh, boy.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.563
I knew it.

24:10.565 --> 24:13.100
Hey.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.236
What do you think?

24:15.337 --> 24:19.773
To be honest, when you said dog,
I was imagining something

24:19.875 --> 24:21.976
What, manlier?

24:22.077 --> 24:23.944
I was gonna say bigger.

24:24.045 --> 24:26.080
I found him digging in
the dumpster a couple years ago

24:26.181 --> 24:27.748
behind my apartment building.

24:27.849 --> 24:29.283
No one claimed him,
so I took him in.

24:29.384 --> 24:32.686
Guess I have a soft spot
for orphans.

24:32.787 --> 24:34.522
He doesn't look like much, but
Murray's got it where it counts.

24:34.623 --> 24:36.724
Don't you, buddy?

24:36.825 --> 24:39.860
Look at this face.
He's a vicious tough guy.

24:39.961 --> 24:41.495
He's a real beast.

24:41.596 --> 24:43.130
You can pet him.
He loves the attention.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.166
I'll take your word for it.

24:45.267 --> 24:46.967
All right.

24:47.068 --> 24:49.003
Don't worry, Murray.
You're gonna be in the backseat.

24:49.104 --> 24:50.604
I'll drive.

24:52.774 --> 24:54.208
Let's rock 'n roll, baby.

25:37.519 --> 25:39.653
Here you go, buddy.

25:59.874 --> 26:01.141
Here we are.

26:05.013 --> 26:06.046
What do you think?

26:07.782 --> 26:09.783
REBECCA: It's not really
my scene.

26:09.884 --> 26:12.353
Of course it isn't.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.134
Thanks.

26:29.704 --> 26:31.305
WOMAN: Be right out!

26:31.406 --> 26:34.108
You should have left him
in the car.

26:34.209 --> 26:35.776
Can't leave them in the car.
That's cruel.

26:35.877 --> 26:37.211
Crack a window.

26:37.312 --> 26:39.046
Maybe I should leave you
in the car.

26:41.650 --> 26:42.983
How can I help you folks?

26:43.084 --> 26:45.953
Hi. I'm actually
looking for someone.

26:46.054 --> 26:48.022
I was hoping you might
be able to help.

26:48.123 --> 26:51.358
I traced the postmark here.

26:51.459 --> 26:53.594
But as you can see,
there's no names.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.329
The only thing on the card
is a heart.

26:55.430 --> 26:57.264
The woman next door said
that you do calligraphy

26:57.365 --> 26:58.265
for address labels.

26:58.366 --> 26:59.833
Not too much anymore.

26:59.934 --> 27:01.969
Everyone's doing
too much email these days.

27:02.070 --> 27:04.071
What about these?

27:04.172 --> 27:08.609
Do you have any recollection
who might have sent that?

27:08.710 --> 27:10.911
If you could tell us anything,
anything at all,

27:11.012 --> 27:12.179
it'd be a really big help.

27:12.280 --> 27:14.448
Even I could remember,

27:14.549 --> 27:16.984
our customer information
is private.

27:17.085 --> 27:19.586
I know, but...

27:21.589 --> 27:24.491
Look, it's almost Christmas,

27:24.592 --> 27:26.927
and this poor girl
just lost her mother recently.

27:27.028 --> 27:30.864
Her dad died
when she was very young.

27:30.965 --> 27:33.334
I'm asking
as a retired marine

27:33.435 --> 27:36.537
if there's anything you can do
to help her out...

27:36.638 --> 27:39.440
Alma.

27:39.541 --> 27:42.176
114.

27:42.277 --> 27:45.379
- 114?
- That was his box number.

27:45.480 --> 27:48.415
I remember box numbers
better than I remember names.

27:48.516 --> 27:51.018
You know, he was kind of
a peculiar fella.

27:51.119 --> 27:54.455
Paid every year upfront
in cash.

27:54.556 --> 27:57.157
You said it<i> was</i>
his box number.

27:57.258 --> 28:00.794
Haven't seen him in a while.
I just assumed he moved.

28:00.895 --> 28:02.062
Let me check.

28:06.134 --> 28:08.602
Yup. 114's vacant.

28:08.703 --> 28:09.703
Sorry.

28:09.804 --> 28:11.505
Is there a name in there?

28:11.606 --> 28:14.808
My records only go back
18 months.

28:14.909 --> 28:17.578
Would you remember
anything about him?

28:17.679 --> 28:18.679
What he looked like?

28:20.882 --> 28:24.952
Thick gray hair,
nice smile, kinda quiet.

28:25.053 --> 28:28.822
Did he ever mention anything
about who he sent the cards to?

28:28.923 --> 28:31.425
Like I said, he was quiet.

28:31.526 --> 28:33.360
But now that you bring it up,

28:33.461 --> 28:36.163
he did mention his sweetheart
a couple of times.

28:38.233 --> 28:39.967
Tell you what.

28:40.068 --> 28:42.369
I've got some unclaimed mail
in the back.

28:42.470 --> 28:46.273
Maybe there's something in there
with his name on it.

28:46.374 --> 28:49.109
Just don't tell anyone.

28:49.210 --> 28:51.912
Oh, it'll be
our little secret.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.952
Help yourself.

29:15.570 --> 29:18.972
So now I know what
one of your skills is.

29:19.073 --> 29:20.441
Oh, yeah? What's that?

29:20.542 --> 29:23.210
Charming information
out of elderly ladies.

29:24.879 --> 29:28.015
Maybe she'll even bake you
an apple pie.

29:28.116 --> 29:30.250
Cute.

29:30.351 --> 29:31.618
Any luck?

29:31.719 --> 29:33.320
No, not yet.

29:33.421 --> 29:35.722
This stuff must go back
ten years, at least.

29:37.459 --> 29:39.159
I am curious.

29:39.260 --> 29:42.296
How do you go from the military
to private detective?

29:42.397 --> 29:44.631
I don't know.

29:44.732 --> 29:46.433
Like I said, I guess I'm just
good at reading people.

29:46.534 --> 29:47.534
Like Alma?

29:47.635 --> 29:48.769
What do you want to know?

29:48.870 --> 29:50.537
What can you tell me?

29:50.638 --> 29:54.508
Well, I can tell you
she's a widower,

29:54.609 --> 29:59.480
and that she took over the
business after her husband died.

29:59.581 --> 30:02.516
I know she has a son and
a grandson in the military

30:02.617 --> 30:06.286
and that the grandson is
still stationed overseas.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.021
I know she recently
had a heart attack,

30:08.122 --> 30:09.456
and that's planning
on retiring,

30:09.557 --> 30:11.391
probably 'cause of
doctor's orders.

30:11.493 --> 30:14.294
How can you possibly
know all that?

30:14.395 --> 30:17.164
A magician never
reveals his secrets.

30:17.265 --> 30:19.233
Seriously.

30:19.334 --> 30:20.701
Please.

30:20.802 --> 30:23.170
Okay, uh...

30:23.271 --> 30:25.672
She had a tan line where
her wedding ring used to be,

30:25.773 --> 30:27.207
Now she wears it on her neck,

30:27.308 --> 30:29.376
which means she wants
to keep him close,

30:29.477 --> 30:31.612
yet she's open
to something new.

30:31.713 --> 30:33.213
There were old cards
on the wall

30:33.314 --> 30:36.016
that were sent to Donald
and Alma at this address,

30:36.117 --> 30:37.885
which implies
he used to work here.

30:37.986 --> 30:39.853
And the military?

30:39.954 --> 30:42.189
There was an armed forces
sticker on the window,

30:42.290 --> 30:43.991
which means somebody very close
to them was in the military,

30:44.092 --> 30:45.826
but it was at least
twenty years old.

30:45.927 --> 30:49.396
The postcard on the counter was
from Kabul. It's more recent.

30:49.497 --> 30:51.265
So somebody that's been
in the military for 20 years,

30:51.366 --> 30:53.800
they're not likely stationed
on the frontlines anymore,

30:53.902 --> 30:56.603
so I went with the grandson.

30:57.972 --> 30:59.540
And what about the heart?

30:59.641 --> 31:02.843
I saw four medicine bottles
on her desk,

31:02.944 --> 31:05.279
next to a catalog
for a retirement community.

31:05.380 --> 31:08.749
Lotensin, Toprol,
Lipitor and aspirin.

31:08.850 --> 31:10.717
That's a combination of
medications usually for--

31:10.818 --> 31:12.753
After a heart attack.

31:12.854 --> 31:14.187
Right.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.690
You learned all that
in the military?

31:16.791 --> 31:18.725
No. I had a thing
with a medic.

31:18.826 --> 31:20.727
A thing?

31:21.963 --> 31:24.898
A thing. Like a thing.

31:24.999 --> 31:27.401
Don't they frown upon that?

31:27.502 --> 31:29.503
You gotta find something
to occupy your time

31:29.604 --> 31:33.373
in between getting shot at.

31:33.474 --> 31:34.875
Was she cute?

31:34.976 --> 31:36.643
No, not really.

31:44.586 --> 31:46.186
Hey, I found something.

31:46.287 --> 31:48.221
What?

31:48.323 --> 31:50.290
PO box 114.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.510
- Nothing.
- What do you mean?

32:10.612 --> 32:13.447
He has to be
in there somewhere.

32:13.548 --> 32:16.249
You know you're not supposed to
have dogs in here, don't you?

32:16.351 --> 32:19.820
I'm sorry. We didn't want
to leave him in the car.

32:19.921 --> 32:22.222
We already know Mr. Semral
had a box at the post office

32:22.323 --> 32:23.657
for several years.

32:23.758 --> 32:25.459
He must have lived
around here somewhere.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.161
All I can tell you is that
he didn't pay property taxes,

32:28.262 --> 32:30.430
and he wasn't
registered to vote.

32:30.531 --> 32:31.798
[stifled sneeze]

32:31.899 --> 32:33.667
What about
the social security system?

32:33.768 --> 32:37.971
This guy has to be
in some system somewhere.

32:38.072 --> 32:39.339
That would be confidential.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.643
All right.
Well, thank you for your time.

32:42.744 --> 32:45.345
Wait, that's it?
You just can't give up.

32:45.446 --> 32:47.047
You heard him.
He's not in the system.

32:47.148 --> 32:48.782
He has to be in there.

32:48.883 --> 32:51.652
Sorry. My girlfriend, sometimes
she gets a little worked up.

32:51.753 --> 32:53.687
Girlfriend?

32:53.788 --> 32:55.255
Come on. Let's go.

32:55.356 --> 32:57.057
Not until we get
some answers.

32:57.158 --> 32:58.625
Rebecca, come on.

32:58.726 --> 33:00.827
Fine.

33:00.928 --> 33:03.163
Thank you for your time.

33:03.264 --> 33:04.931
Just go, just go.
Thank you.

33:05.033 --> 33:06.533
Thank you.

33:10.605 --> 33:12.339
What was that all about?

33:12.440 --> 33:14.307
We could have gotten
more information.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.309
For an investigative reporter,

33:16.411 --> 33:18.578
you'd think you'd be a little
bit better at reading people.

33:18.680 --> 33:20.414
What's that supposed to mean?

33:20.515 --> 33:22.516
- He told us everything he knew.
- Which was nothing.

33:22.617 --> 33:24.985
We have to get into
that other database.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.987
Well, unfortunately
he was telling the truth.

33:27.088 --> 33:28.355
Those records
are confidential.

33:28.456 --> 33:30.524
So we're back to square one.

33:30.625 --> 33:33.226
Well...

33:33.327 --> 33:34.995
I wouldn't say that.

33:43.037 --> 33:44.671
Hey, it's lunch.

33:44.772 --> 33:47.641
We're gonna go across the street
and grab a burger.

33:47.742 --> 33:49.309
I'm coming right now.

33:59.253 --> 34:01.621
Hurry up. We don't know what
time they'll be back from lunch.

34:01.723 --> 34:03.490
Relax.

34:15.903 --> 34:16.970
No entry found.

34:32.086 --> 34:33.487
Someone's coming.

34:33.588 --> 34:34.621
I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.

34:51.572 --> 34:52.806
Quick. This way.

34:57.044 --> 34:58.545
I don't know what happened
to my card.

34:58.646 --> 35:00.380
I must have left it
in here somewhere.

35:00.481 --> 35:02.783
I left mine in the cafeteria
two weeks ago.

35:02.884 --> 35:05.385
You know they charged me
40 bucks for it?

35:05.486 --> 35:06.787
- [stifled sneeze]
- Are you getting sick?

35:06.888 --> 35:07.988
I'm allergic to dogs.

35:08.089 --> 35:09.790
- [sneeze]
- Bless you.

35:09.891 --> 35:12.225
Oh, my goodness.
Excuse me.

35:12.326 --> 35:14.094
Oh, here's my card
right here.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.729
Oh, good.

35:19.100 --> 35:22.102
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. I told you not to worry.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.511
[line ringing]

35:32.914 --> 35:34.848
[ringing continues]

35:36.918 --> 35:38.118
Damn.

35:40.121 --> 35:43.156
She's coming back.
I gotta go.

35:43.257 --> 35:45.458
Who was that?

35:45.560 --> 35:49.196
Just a client checking in.
How'd you make out?

35:49.297 --> 35:50.831
No answer.

35:50.932 --> 35:52.699
It's getting pretty late.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.168
We should probably think about
where we're gonna stay tonight.

35:55.269 --> 35:58.605
I think we passed that bed and
breakfast on the way into town.

35:58.706 --> 36:00.674
A bed-and-breakfast?

36:00.775 --> 36:02.042
Come on, it'll be great.

36:02.143 --> 36:04.811
When in Rome, right?

36:24.065 --> 36:27.601

I think I saw some places
out on Route 1. Let's go.

37:23.958 --> 37:26.159
Good idea.

37:27.361 --> 37:30.063
- Can I help you?
- You scared us.

37:30.164 --> 37:33.967
I'm sorry. I was out back.
I didn't hear you.

37:34.068 --> 37:35.568
Can I help you
with something?

37:35.670 --> 37:38.138
We were wondering
if you had any vacancies.

37:38.239 --> 37:39.306
And if you allow dogs.

37:39.407 --> 37:42.309
Ooh, uh...

37:43.878 --> 37:46.880
How many rooms
you looking for?

37:46.981 --> 37:48.048
Two.

37:48.149 --> 37:49.783
I only got one.

37:49.884 --> 37:51.484
Really? You're booked?

37:51.585 --> 37:53.720
Yeah, but...

37:53.821 --> 37:56.323
You can try the Seaview
out on Route 1.

37:56.424 --> 37:59.092
They usually book up quicker
than I do though.

37:59.193 --> 38:02.395
You know what? Murray and I
can sleep out in the car.

38:02.496 --> 38:03.730
No, you can't do that.

38:03.831 --> 38:05.598
- It's fine.
- It's cold.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.967
You know how many stakeouts
I've camped out in that thing?

38:07.068 --> 38:08.401
It's fine, really.

38:08.502 --> 38:10.770
Well, I guess we'll take it.

38:10.871 --> 38:13.239
That'll be $85.

38:20.548 --> 38:21.481
Thank you.

38:21.582 --> 38:24.317
Rebecca Clark.

38:24.418 --> 38:27.420
You know what? Maybe you can
help us with something.

38:27.521 --> 38:29.089
We're looking for somebody.

38:29.190 --> 38:31.691
Jack Semral?

38:31.792 --> 38:33.994
Does that name ring a bell?

38:34.095 --> 38:35.328
No.

38:35.429 --> 38:38.131
No, sorry.

38:38.232 --> 38:41.001
Here you go.
It's upstairs.

38:41.102 --> 38:42.602
First room on your left.

38:42.703 --> 38:43.703
Thank you very much.

38:43.804 --> 38:45.438
Enjoy your stay.

38:51.712 --> 38:53.980
Murray, come on.
Come on, buddy.

39:00.121 --> 39:03.223
Do you mind if I take
a quick shower before we go?

39:03.324 --> 39:05.458
Of course.

39:05.559 --> 39:06.659
Tell you what.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.061
You take your time.

39:08.162 --> 39:10.230
- I'll take Murray for a walk.
- Great.

39:10.331 --> 39:12.132
Come on, Murray.

39:12.233 --> 39:14.367
Come on.
Let's go get some exercise.

39:14.468 --> 39:15.535
Okay, buddy.

39:15.636 --> 39:17.537
See you in a bit.

39:17.638 --> 39:18.805
Yeah.

39:27.014 --> 39:28.548
[line ringing]

39:51.272 --> 39:53.840
So, Murray,
now we're alone,

39:53.941 --> 39:56.676
what can you tell me
about Andrew?

39:56.777 --> 40:00.847
I mean, you're probably closer
to him than anyone else.

40:00.948 --> 40:03.116
Is there anything
I should know?

40:03.217 --> 40:05.218
Is he seeing anyone?

40:05.319 --> 40:08.788
What kind of food
does he like?

40:08.889 --> 40:11.858
What kind of music
does he listen to?

40:11.959 --> 40:13.526
Does he snore?

40:14.662 --> 40:16.129
You're not helping.

40:16.230 --> 40:17.697
Come on.

40:23.904 --> 40:25.138
We're back!

40:25.239 --> 40:27.340
ANDREW: I'm almost done.

40:29.410 --> 40:31.678
I was getting worried there.

40:38.819 --> 40:41.321
Are you hungry?

40:41.422 --> 40:44.958
I thought maybe we could
go get something to eat.

40:45.059 --> 40:48.261
Uh, yeah, that sounds good.

40:48.362 --> 40:52.065
You know, um, why don't you
finish getting ready,

40:52.166 --> 40:55.435
and I can meet you in the lobby
in like 20 minutes?

40:55.536 --> 40:56.870
Sure.

40:56.971 --> 41:01.941
And keep an eye on Murray
for me.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.544
All right.
I'll see you in a bit.

41:34.658 --> 41:38.495
Grownup clothes. I didn't think
you had it in you.

41:38.596 --> 41:41.831
Me? Look at you.
You look absolutely--

41:41.932 --> 41:46.870
Should I remind you that
technically I'm your boss?

41:46.971 --> 41:49.105
- You hungry?
- Starving.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.042
REBECCA: I even left
my cell phone in my room.

41:53.143 --> 41:54.310
ANDREW: Good idea.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.337
So how long did you serve?

42:21.438 --> 42:23.039
Eight years.

42:23.140 --> 42:26.609
I saw the scars.
Are those war wounds?

42:26.710 --> 42:30.380
Uh, yeah, a few of them.

42:30.481 --> 42:34.217
I can't imagine the pain
you must have gone through.

42:34.318 --> 42:35.685
Or still going through.

42:35.786 --> 42:37.353
Yeah, well,
it comes with the job.

42:37.454 --> 42:39.289
I made it.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.990
Some of my buddies didn't.

42:41.091 --> 42:43.693
I'm sorry.

42:43.794 --> 42:46.229
You know, I can't help but
think about their families,

42:46.330 --> 42:48.698
especially this time of year,

42:48.799 --> 42:50.466
being without the ones
they loved.

42:50.568 --> 42:54.203
What about you?
Any special Christmas memories?

42:54.305 --> 42:58.408
No, no. It was always
pretty low key 'cause of my dad.

42:58.509 --> 42:59.576
With the work
and everything.

42:59.677 --> 43:01.244
Ah, fireman. Right.

43:01.345 --> 43:06.849
You know, my mom she used to
write these little notes,

43:06.951 --> 43:08.418
and she'd put them
in his lunches,

43:08.519 --> 43:10.420
and then around Christmas,
she'd...

43:10.521 --> 43:13.656
she'd cut out like pictures
from magazines, newspapers,

43:13.757 --> 43:16.092
anything that reminded her
of the holiday,

43:16.193 --> 43:17.760
and she'd make
a little collage for him.

43:17.861 --> 43:20.330
That's such a romantic thing
to do.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.998
Even after he died,

43:22.099 --> 43:24.601
every single day she continued
to write him a note.

43:24.702 --> 43:26.502
She never wanted
to break the habit.

43:28.906 --> 43:32.175
You know,
they're gone now and...

43:32.276 --> 43:34.010
I don't know.
It's funny.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.112
It doesn't really feel like
Christmas

43:36.213 --> 43:38.214
unless you have someone
to buy gifts for.

43:39.883 --> 43:45.021
My mom and I were a mess
after my dad's accident.

43:45.122 --> 43:48.157
Is that why
you went away to school?

43:48.258 --> 43:50.193
She thought it would
be good for me.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.561
You don't agree.

43:51.662 --> 43:53.863
I don't know.
Just kinda felt like...

43:53.964 --> 43:56.132
Like she was trying
to get rid of you.

43:58.769 --> 44:00.670
Anyway, if it wasn't
for Mary and Logan,

44:00.771 --> 44:03.673
I don't think
we would've made it.

44:03.774 --> 44:06.843
I shouldn't have left things
the way that I did.

44:06.944 --> 44:09.646
- What happened?
- It was a fight.

44:09.747 --> 44:11.514
Over a guy, of course.

44:11.615 --> 44:14.851
She didn't think
I should've ended things.

44:14.952 --> 44:16.352
I thought it was--

44:16.453 --> 44:18.955
It was none of her business?

44:19.056 --> 44:21.190
It was silly.

44:21.291 --> 44:25.061
After, it felt easier to
avoid her than to talk about it.

44:27.131 --> 44:29.832
I never got a chance
to say I'm sorry.

44:29.933 --> 44:33.603
I never got to tell her
how much I loved her.

44:33.704 --> 44:36.005
Kids grow up.

44:36.106 --> 44:39.008
They move on, and they
start lives of their own.

44:39.109 --> 44:41.144
Sometimes parents
forget about that.

44:41.245 --> 44:44.147
You had no idea what was gonna
happen. You couldn't have.

44:44.248 --> 44:47.517
You can't beat yourself up
over it.

44:47.618 --> 44:50.353
She used to have
this expression:

44:50.454 --> 44:52.488
"Ships that pass
in the night."

44:52.589 --> 44:54.924
I always thought she was
talking about my father,

44:55.025 --> 44:59.028
but she might as well have
been talking about us.

44:59.129 --> 45:04.033
"Ships that pass in the night
and speak each other in passing.

45:04.134 --> 45:10.139
Only a signal shown and
a distant voice in the darkness.

45:10.240 --> 45:14.477
So on this ocean of life,
we pass and speak one another.

45:14.578 --> 45:16.379
A look and a voice,

45:16.480 --> 45:19.015
and then darkness again
and the silence."

45:19.116 --> 45:20.016
Wow.

45:20.117 --> 45:21.217
Longfellow.

45:23.654 --> 45:26.255
So you think finding Jack
will mean...

45:26.356 --> 45:29.225
that your mom wasn't
as lonely as you thought.

45:29.326 --> 45:32.495
She might even
have been happy.

45:36.500 --> 45:39.969
You know what? Come on.

45:40.070 --> 45:41.471

some noise, so he called her,

something in there

where Jack went.

I would've hid something.

wasn't just paranoid.

He was being watched.

Why would he leave these behind?

1:01:22.412 --> 1:01:24.546

in some kind hurry.

closer than you thought.

you wouldn't understand.

Maybe she was trying
to protect you.

Yeah. Maybe.

1:02:34.350 --> 1:02:35.751

Yeah, but I don't want you
to get hurt.

1:04:54.156 --> 1:04:56.591
I told Logan
that I'd look after you.

1:04:56.692 --> 1:04:58.827
I owe it to him to bring you
back in one piece.

1:04:58.928 --> 1:05:00.962
I'm going to find him,

1:05:01.063 --> 1:05:03.498
and I'm gonna do it
with or without you,

1:05:03.599 --> 1:05:05.367
although with
would be better.

1:05:07.169 --> 1:05:09.304
What?

1:05:09.405 --> 1:05:10.438
Nothing.

1:05:10.539 --> 1:05:12.474
Just thinking.

1:05:12.575 --> 1:05:15.443
About?

1:05:15.544 --> 1:05:21.016
Whether a big-city reporter and
an ex-military grunt could...

1:05:21.117 --> 1:05:22.183
you know.

1:05:22.285 --> 1:05:23.919
You think too much.

1:05:25.454 --> 1:05:26.755
Do I?

1:05:56.085 --> 1:05:58.186
ANDREW: I don't know.
She's determined.

1:05:58.287 --> 1:06:01.489
No, no, look that is not
part of the deal.

1:06:01.590 --> 1:06:03.758
I'm just supposed
to watch her.

1:06:05.995 --> 1:06:08.163
No, no, we haven't
found him yet.

1:06:08.264 --> 1:06:13.401
Yes, of course,
you'll be the first to know.

1:06:13.502 --> 1:06:15.403
Look, there's something
I've gotta take care of.

1:06:15.504 --> 1:06:17.305
I'll talk to you later, okay?

1:06:17.406 --> 1:06:19.140
All right.

1:06:24.413 --> 1:06:26.881
Is everything okay?

1:06:26.983 --> 1:06:29.284
I'm not sure.

1:06:30.319 --> 1:06:31.619

Hi. It's me.

1:06:39.028 --> 1:06:40.395
You must want the funnies.

1:06:40.496 --> 1:06:42.564

colleagues are here in New York

1:06:46.502 --> 1:06:48.003
freezing our knishes off.

1:06:48.104 --> 1:06:51.439
No. I need your help
with something.

1:06:51.540 --> 1:06:53.908
Do I even wanna ask?

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:55.410
I'm emailing you some photos.

1:06:55.511 --> 1:06:57.746
<i> I found these</i>
<i> hidden in a drawer.</i>

1:06:57.847 --> 1:06:59.881
Can you check the database
for a match?

1:06:59.982 --> 1:07:01.750
Wait. Are you working a story?

1:07:01.851 --> 1:07:03.952
<i> I just need to know</i>
<i> who this guy is.</i>

1:07:04.053 --> 1:07:05.820
Harvey's gonna kill me.

1:07:05.921 --> 1:07:07.789
Which is why you're
not gonna tell him.

1:07:07.890 --> 1:07:09.224
Okay, let's see.

1:07:09.325 --> 1:07:11.459
Remember the days
before computers

1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:13.128
when we used to go through
mug shots by hand?

1:07:13.229 --> 1:07:14.562
Those were the good ol' days.

1:07:18.734 --> 1:07:20.769
Okay, first of all,
it was only $400,

1:07:20.870 --> 1:07:22.604
<i> and secondly</i>
<i> it was for elfin steel.</i>

1:07:22.705 --> 1:07:24.039

1:07:24.140 --> 1:07:25.607

1:07:25.708 --> 1:07:27.075
Is that Clark?

1:07:28.544 --> 1:07:30.378
Um...

1:07:30.479 --> 1:07:31.980
Give it.

1:07:33.716 --> 1:07:35.550
<i> You're a brilliant writer.</i>

1:07:35.651 --> 1:07:38.720

1:07:41.557 --> 1:07:43.925
It's not a story.
He's just helping me out.

1:07:44.026 --> 1:07:46.094
Oh, so he's using
business resources

1:07:46.195 --> 1:07:47.595
for your personal matter.

1:07:47.696 --> 1:07:50.165
Fine. I'll owe you a puff piece
when I get back.

1:07:50.266 --> 1:07:52.100
Make it two.

1:07:52.201 --> 1:07:55.937
Deal. Can you please
give me back to Edward?

1:08:00.543 --> 1:08:02.444
Thank you for that,
by the way.

1:08:04.213 --> 1:08:05.580
Okay, I got it.

<i> Even better. I can tell you</i>

1:08:15.424 --> 1:08:16.925

1:08:17.026 --> 1:08:19.427
Oh! You startled me.

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:22.297
Where'd you go
this morning?

1:08:22.398 --> 1:08:23.665
You left so early.

1:08:23.766 --> 1:08:26.468
Oh, I, uh,
just had to run an errand.

1:08:26.569 --> 1:08:27.936
That's all.

1:08:28.037 --> 1:08:29.637
So did you find anything out
about the guy?

1:08:29.738 --> 1:08:32.073
Actually, no.
He wasn't able to help.

1:08:32.174 --> 1:08:33.842
That's too bad.

1:08:33.943 --> 1:08:36.044
Look, do you mind if I have
a couple of hours

1:08:36.145 --> 1:08:37.645
to myself this morning?

1:08:37.746 --> 1:08:40.215
You know, with everything
that happened yesterday.

1:08:40.316 --> 1:08:42.383
Of course. Take the morning off.
We'll meet up for lunch.

1:08:42.485 --> 1:08:45.553
Dennis says there's a great
pizza place in town.

1:08:45.654 --> 1:08:47.288
Sounds good.

1:09:17.219 --> 1:09:18.653
I'm here to see Frank Johnson.

1:09:52.821 --> 1:09:54.522

I know you were watching him.

1:10:01.397 --> 1:10:03.097
What?

1:10:03.199 --> 1:10:05.567
I know you were watching him.

1:10:05.668 --> 1:10:07.268
I've watched a lot of people.

1:10:07.369 --> 1:10:09.070
Hadleyville.

1:10:09.171 --> 1:10:11.306
Worked in a fish market.

1:10:11.407 --> 1:10:13.241
Rented a house off Hera Drive.

1:10:13.342 --> 1:10:14.909
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You mean the older guy.

1:10:15.010 --> 1:10:17.045
Why were you watching him?

1:10:17.146 --> 1:10:19.447
I think the real question is

1:10:19.548 --> 1:10:21.382
why would a reporter
from the<i> New York Ledger</i>

1:10:21.483 --> 1:10:24.085
travel 3,000 miles
across the country

1:10:24.186 --> 1:10:25.653
to ask questions about him.

1:10:25.754 --> 1:10:27.255
Who hired you?

1:10:27.356 --> 1:10:30.625
Now you're asking
expensive questions.

1:10:30.726 --> 1:10:31.793
How much?

1:10:31.894 --> 1:10:33.528
Why?

1:10:35.598 --> 1:10:37.899
He's...

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.535
a friend of the family.

1:10:43.572 --> 1:10:46.307
So there is no story.

1:10:46.408 --> 1:10:47.976
You know it's a crime
to lie,

1:10:48.077 --> 1:10:51.346
to lie to the warden,
reporter?

1:10:51.447 --> 1:10:53.815
But you're in luck.

1:10:53.916 --> 1:10:55.583
I've got an opening
for a new roommate.

1:10:55.684 --> 1:10:58.419
Just give me a name.

1:10:59.788 --> 1:11:01.122
Give me a reason.

1:11:04.293 --> 1:11:06.928
You lost someone too.

1:11:09.465 --> 1:11:11.065
Who was it?

1:11:12.334 --> 1:11:14.168
Father?

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:15.737
Mother?

1:11:17.573 --> 1:11:19.774
All I need is a name.

1:11:24.813 --> 1:11:28.650
[humming]

1:11:28.751 --> 1:11:32.387
Fine. I see this was
a complete waste of time.

Cayman Savings Bank.

1:11:37.626 --> 1:11:44.198
CD 937-648-N.

1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:48.703
That's account number
the wire transfers came from.

1:11:48.804 --> 1:11:50.271
That's all I know.

1:11:55.411 --> 1:11:59.947
[humming]

1:12:08.891 --> 1:12:10.558
Come on.

1:12:39.421 --> 1:12:40.922
Hah!

1:12:42.925 --> 1:12:45.727
Whoever you are, someone
should really talk to you

1:12:45.828 --> 1:12:48.196
about your internet security.

1:12:52.301 --> 1:12:53.835

<i> because of some</i>
<i> evidential technicality...</i>

1:13:23.832 --> 1:13:26.200
Evidential technicality.

1:13:27.336 --> 1:13:29.404
According to these wires,

1:13:29.505 --> 1:13:33.107
Charles Peterson
paid Logan off.

1:13:33.208 --> 1:13:37.445
Then why were they interested
in Jack Semral?

1:13:40.349 --> 1:13:41.883
Unless...

1:14:17.653 --> 1:14:19.153
Dad.

1:14:20.556 --> 1:14:22.123
What are you doing?

1:14:22.224 --> 1:14:23.958
Stay away from me!

1:14:24.059 --> 1:14:26.227
What? Rebecca.

1:14:26.328 --> 1:14:27.428
Rebecca.

1:14:27.529 --> 1:14:29.297
Help! Somebody!

1:14:29.398 --> 1:14:30.765
Rebecca!

1:14:32.067 --> 1:14:33.434
Rebecca, just--

1:14:33.535 --> 1:14:35.870
Rebecca, wait up.

1:14:35.971 --> 1:14:38.940
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!

1:14:39.041 --> 1:14:40.641
- Why are you acting like this?
- I know!

1:14:40.742 --> 1:14:42.009
Know what?

1:14:42.110 --> 1:14:43.811
About Charles Peterson
and Jack Semral.

1:14:43.912 --> 1:14:45.780
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1:14:45.881 --> 1:14:47.915
You've been working for him
all along, haven't you?

1:14:48.016 --> 1:14:49.851
- Who?
- Logan.

1:14:49.952 --> 1:14:51.185
That's where you went
this morning,

1:14:51.286 --> 1:14:54.021
to tell him
what was going on.

1:14:54.122 --> 1:14:56.524
Yes. He asked me
to look after you.

1:14:56.625 --> 1:14:59.360
But that's it, I swear.

1:14:59.461 --> 1:15:01.796
Where were you?

1:15:01.897 --> 1:15:03.965
Tell me or I'm walking
right now.

1:15:04.066 --> 1:15:06.033
Are you serious?

1:15:07.936 --> 1:15:09.203
Fine.

1:15:09.304 --> 1:15:12.907
I was buying you
a Christmas present.

1:15:13.008 --> 1:15:15.042
Happy?

1:15:18.247 --> 1:15:19.647
It's beautiful.

1:15:19.748 --> 1:15:22.950
Rebecca, what's going on?

1:15:23.051 --> 1:15:24.185
You really have no idea.

1:15:24.286 --> 1:15:25.820
No idea about what?

1:15:25.921 --> 1:15:28.723
Jack Semral is my father.

1:15:33.529 --> 1:15:36.497
I don't believe it.
Logan was being paid off?

1:15:36.598 --> 1:15:40.001
He must have tampered
with the evidence.

1:15:40.102 --> 1:15:42.904
That's how Peterson
got the case dismissed.

1:15:43.005 --> 1:15:45.273
And if my father
figured it out...

1:15:45.374 --> 1:15:47.375
He would've been a loose end.

1:15:47.476 --> 1:15:49.010
He knew they were
coming after him.

1:15:49.111 --> 1:15:50.778
That's why he disappeared.

1:15:50.879 --> 1:15:54.248
So he faked his death.

1:15:54.349 --> 1:15:57.752
Look, Rebecca,
I swear to you,

1:15:57.853 --> 1:16:00.721
Logan, he asked me
to help you.

1:16:00.822 --> 1:16:03.958
He asked me to keep him
informed. That's it.

1:16:04.059 --> 1:16:07.728
<i> I had no idea that</i>
<i> he was being paid off.</i>

1:16:07.829 --> 1:16:10.965
<i> I would never hurt you.</i>

1:16:11.066 --> 1:16:13.768
<i> I was just doing my job.</i>

1:16:13.869 --> 1:16:16.304
REBECCA:<i> Sure. I get it.</i>

1:16:17.706 --> 1:16:20.675
Well, look,
what do you wanna do now?

1:16:20.776 --> 1:16:23.010
I want to go back
to his house.

1:16:27.883 --> 1:16:29.116
Miss Clark, Miss Clark!

1:16:29.217 --> 1:16:31.085
I'm kinda in a hurry.

1:16:31.186 --> 1:16:34.255
Yeah, yeah, um...
can you sign this?

1:16:34.356 --> 1:16:35.823
- Please?
- What?

1:16:35.924 --> 1:16:37.258
My wife and I,

1:16:37.359 --> 1:16:39.327
we moved from New York
a couple years ago.

1:16:39.428 --> 1:16:41.462
She insisted on keeping
a subscription.

1:16:41.563 --> 1:16:42.964
She's a real big fan.

1:16:43.065 --> 1:16:45.933
All this time we thought
you were stalking me.

1:16:46.034 --> 1:16:47.535
What?

1:16:47.636 --> 1:16:49.303
Oh, no, no, no!

1:16:49.404 --> 1:16:52.039
We just don't get a lot of
famous people around here.

1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:54.175
Yeah. What's your wife's name?

1:16:54.276 --> 1:16:55.676
Delores.

1:16:59.982 --> 1:17:01.382
What are we looking for?

1:17:01.483 --> 1:17:04.919
I don't know.
There has to be something.

1:17:05.020 --> 1:17:06.487
You knew the man.
Does anything stand out?

1:17:06.588 --> 1:17:09.890
No. Nothing looks familiar.

1:17:13.395 --> 1:17:14.562
Wait a minute.

1:17:19.601 --> 1:17:20.735
A boat?

1:17:25.073 --> 1:17:26.474
Look at the sweater.

1:17:26.575 --> 1:17:27.775
I thought it was my name,

1:17:27.876 --> 1:17:29.410
but what if it isn't?

I'm running a search for his
boat through AIS right now.

1:17:51.967 --> 1:17:53.100
What's that?

1:17:53.201 --> 1:17:56.871
AIS is a tracking system
for boats.

1:17:56.972 --> 1:18:00.007
Class A is commercial ships,

1:18:00.108 --> 1:18:02.576
freighters, tugboats,
that sort of thing.

1:18:02.678 --> 1:18:05.513
But class B is
recreational boats.

1:18:05.614 --> 1:18:07.882
All we have to do is put in
the name of the vessel,

1:18:07.983 --> 1:18:11.085
and it should tell us
exactly where he's at.

1:18:12.821 --> 1:18:14.722
Huh.

I found them when I was

1:20:38.667 --> 1:20:41.101
I thought she had
a secret admirer,

so I hired Andrew here

1:20:44.573 --> 1:20:47.241
The postmark led us
