00:02.836 --> 00:04.838
We will be having a roast.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.109
- The roast is gonna be
about the Queen of the North.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.478
And I assumed that meant
Priyanka.

00:11.478 --> 00:12.512
(laughing)

00:12.512 --> 00:15.415
- Take in this beauty.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.551
Brooke Lynn, take note.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.820
- Your face, is fucking full,

Shantay, you stay.

00:27.961 --> 00:31.431
Kimora Amour, sashay, away.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.803
(upbeat music)

00:40.274 --> 00:41.275
- [Pythia] So Kimora is gone,

00:41.275 --> 00:46.046
and I'm going to miss
her grandmotherly energy.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.848
- Mother? Out!

00:49.383 --> 00:51.685
God bless that girl.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.487
I'm kind of in shock.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.822
I love you Kimora.

00:55.822 --> 00:59.793
Thank you for bringing so much
heart to this competition.

00:59.793 --> 01:03.096
You sprinkled your star dust on
all of us.

01:03.096 --> 01:05.999
Kimora is gone and she...

01:05.999 --> 01:07.200
- Will be remembered.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.735
(laughing)

01:08.735 --> 01:10.904
- [Gia Metric] She definitely
will be remembered.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.806
- I am feeling heartbroken.

01:12.806 --> 01:16.376
I just have so much respect
for her as a person,

01:16.376 --> 01:17.878
as a friend.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.613
Her presence will be missed
here.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.814
- Forever sisters.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.215
But,

01:22.215 --> 01:23.684
we're top five.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.352
(screaming in excitement)

01:25.352 --> 01:28.188
- Speaking of being on top, Ms.
Kendall.

01:29.156 --> 01:30.324
- [All] Yeah.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.325
- You had a good week.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.560
- Going from so low to so high,

01:33.560 --> 01:35.395
it makes me feel proud of
myself.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.764
I'm feeling real fuckin' happy

01:37.764 --> 01:39.333
and a little bit richer, honey.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.167
(laughing)

01:40.167 --> 01:42.936
I finally have my win,

01:42.936 --> 01:46.406
so now the competition
has really started for me.

01:46.406 --> 01:48.075
- [Icesis Couture] I'm
so happy that the judges

01:48.075 --> 01:49.876
finally liked one of your looks.

01:49.876 --> 01:51.912
(screaming)

01:51.912 --> 01:53.580
- Oh my god, the ass.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.716
- [Gia Metric] Yeah. Give us
a little dance, bitch. Yeah.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.419
- We love to see her go.

01:59.419 --> 02:01.655
- [Icesis Couture] Come on top

02:01.655 --> 02:03.290
- Top five!

02:03.290 --> 02:05.158
- [Kendall Gender] At this
point in the competition,

02:05.158 --> 02:07.094
it is anyone's game.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.064
Each of us in the top five,

02:11.064 --> 02:12.399
all have different strengths.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.434
You wanna beat the best.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.403
And that's exactly what I'm
gonna do.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.740
- Doesn't it look like a turkey?

02:22.209 --> 02:23.710
- [RuPaul] The winner
of Canada's Drag Race

02:23.710 --> 02:25.879

02:46.666 --> 02:49.169
(bright music)

02:49.169 --> 02:51.271
- [Gia Metric] It is a
new day in the work room.

02:51.271 --> 02:54.975
The further along we get, the
win becomes more realistic.

02:54.975 --> 02:59.946
I can see the crown on my
head. It's right there.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.982
Count all of us on one hand,
bitch.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.817
- And we have a group of winners
here.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.085
- It's true.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.787
It's a quite unique top five.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.389
We all represent completely
different sectors of drag.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.758
- We've all had our shining star
moment.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.193
- Musical.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.227
- Comedy.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.263
- I was girl group.

03:16.263 --> 03:17.497
- Acting.

03:17.497 --> 03:18.899
Sewing?

03:18.899 --> 03:21.168
- [Kendall Gender] Oh, you
really had to dig that in.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.235
Doughing, not sewing.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.207
- It's okay.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.609
(siren blaring)

03:29.609 --> 03:31.011
- [RuPaul] Canada.

03:31.011 --> 03:34.081
(speaking indistinctly)

03:34.081 --> 03:38.185
My queens, whether you are a
virgin or going all the way,

03:38.185 --> 03:41.788
tis the season for queen to
slay.

03:41.788 --> 03:45.625
So bless this dress and
snatch that ponytail tight.

03:45.625 --> 03:49.196
Because tonight's the
night to shine your light.

03:52.432 --> 03:53.967
- What is that?

03:53.967 --> 03:56.336
- Bonjour! Hello. Hi.

03:56.336 --> 03:57.804
Our final five.

03:57.804 --> 03:58.638
- Hey!

04:00.507 --> 04:04.377
- You've all made it so
far. You must be so proud.

04:04.377 --> 04:05.545
- Yeah.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.414
- And of course, during the
competition,

04:07.414 --> 04:09.683
you've been cut off from
your family and loved ones.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.686
But I can only imagine how
excited they would be for you.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.222
- Gia Metric, what would your
mama say

04:15.222 --> 04:17.524
when she finds out
you're in the final five?

04:17.524 --> 04:20.093
- She is going to be so proud of
me.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.796
She is my number one fan.
She is my best friend.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.197
- Why don't we just ask her?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.702
- [Gia Metric] Is this live?
Hello?

04:28.702 --> 04:30.103
- Hi!

04:30.103 --> 04:30.937
- Wait, what?

04:30.937 --> 04:34.040
- [Susan] Oh my sweetie. I can
see you.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.209
- Oh my God, hi mom!

04:36.209 --> 04:41.148
- [Susan] I just want you to
know that I'm so proud of you.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.916
You got yourself there.

04:42.916 --> 04:43.750
- I did.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.718
- And you can do it.

04:44.718 --> 04:48.388
- Thank you so much for
always being my number one fan

04:48.388 --> 04:49.789
and my number one supporter.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.392
And I couldn't be here
without the strength

04:52.392 --> 04:54.561
that you have given me.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.096
Fuck. Oh my God.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.798
- [Susan] You've got this.

04:58.798 --> 04:59.799
- [Gia Metric] Thanks mom.

04:59.799 --> 05:00.634
- I love you.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.903
- Oh my gosh, I love you so
much.

05:02.903 --> 05:07.073
- [Susan] Big hugs. Ooh,
big hugs! So proud of you!

05:07.073 --> 05:09.309
Bring that crown home.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.911
- I will!

05:10.911 --> 05:11.745
(clapping)

05:11.745 --> 05:13.446
We all want to make our moms
proud

05:13.446 --> 05:18.418
and to know that I've made her
proud is like, like I've won.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.588
- [Kendall Gender] Of all the
days, why did I wear mascara?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.657
And I thought we were doing
fucking puppets today.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.892
(laughing)

05:26.860 --> 05:29.095
- Adriana look who it is.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.464
- Oh, my!

05:31.464 --> 05:33.099

05:33.099 --> 05:34.434
(speaking foreign language)

05:34.434 --> 05:37.003
- I'm fucking top five...

05:37.003 --> 05:38.405
(laughing)

05:38.405 --> 05:41.241
- Oh my God. That's amazing.

05:41.241 --> 05:44.811
- And it's so much thanks
to you. We're a team

05:44.811 --> 05:48.381
and I'm so glad that I got
to show all that we've worked

05:48.381 --> 05:49.783
together for.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.551
And I am proud of us.

05:51.551 --> 05:54.287
And I cannot wait to come and
hug you.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.426
- [Yannick] Bring back
the crown, slay those,

05:59.426 --> 06:01.861
I don't know who those
bitch are, but slay them.

06:01.861 --> 06:02.929
(laughing)

06:02.929 --> 06:04.397
I can't wait for you to be back,

06:04.397 --> 06:06.766
but don't come back too soon,
okay.

06:06.766 --> 06:07.601
I love you.

06:08.768 --> 06:09.603
Je'taime, baby.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.706
- [Adriana] He's not
just my partner in life.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.642
He's my partner in drag too.

06:15.642 --> 06:18.445
A good part of these
looks are thanks to him.

06:18.445 --> 06:19.813
- He's so hot.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.314
- I know.

06:21.314 --> 06:22.749
- I'm going to hit him up
to make me some costumes.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.851
- [Adriana] He does some
injectables, so.

06:24.851 --> 06:25.719
- Oh!

06:25.719 --> 06:27.254
- Oh, honey, now we're really
talking.

06:27.254 --> 06:30.357
I've never done it personally,
but I hear it's great.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.291
- [Traci Melchor] Kendall,

06:31.291 --> 06:33.827
we have someone very

06:44.871 --> 06:47.307
- You have changed my

06:47.307 --> 06:49.342
And like being away from you,

06:49.342 --> 06:51.378
from this time makes me
realize like, you're,

06:51.378 --> 06:52.512
you're my soulmate.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.447

06:54.447 --> 06:57.684
- I have learned so much
from her as a person.

06:57.684 --> 07:01.021
I have been with her through
her entire transition.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.423
What I learned from her in her
strength

07:03.423 --> 07:07.127
and her perseverance is
unmatched to me.

07:07.127 --> 07:10.764
I am forever in awe of
the person that she is.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.866
- I'm so proud of you and
I'm so excited that you

07:12.866 --> 07:15.335

I miss you literally so much.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.614
I put your like perfume on my
pillow.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.083
(laughing)

07:30.083 --> 07:31.351
- I love you.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.753
- [Patch] I love you so much.

07:34.954 --> 07:39.459
- Just seeing her face makes
me remember why I'm here,

07:39.459 --> 07:42.329
what I'm doing, what I'm
fighting for.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.697
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Okay,
queens.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.765
Who should go home this week and
why?

07:45.765 --> 07:48.034
(laughing)

07:49.602 --> 07:54.240
- Icesis, guess who can't
wait to talk to you right now.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.776

07:56.776 --> 07:57.610
- Hi mum.

07:57.610 --> 07:58.445

I miss you.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.415
- [Icesis Couture] I miss you so
much.

08:03.783 --> 08:04.918
Mom I did it,

08:06.219 --> 08:08.121
I fucking did it.

08:08.121 --> 08:11.324
- I knew you'd do it.
I told you, you could.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.926
- I talk about being a lone
wolf,

08:12.926 --> 08:14.928
but this lone wolf has a pack.

08:14.928 --> 08:18.565
My mom believes in me more as a
drag queen

08:18.565 --> 08:20.500
than sometimes I do myself.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.335
- From the day you started drag,

08:22.335 --> 08:25.238
I knew you were going to be
on something spectacular,

08:25.238 --> 08:26.406
like Drag Race.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.174
You've come really far.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.776
And I love you very much.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.579
And I'm very proud of everything
you do.

08:32.579 --> 08:33.847
And you got this.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.416
You're bringing that crown
home to your mama Icesis,

08:36.416 --> 08:37.517
you know that.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.985
Be who you are,

08:38.985 --> 08:41.621
the iconic Icesis Couture we
know you are.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.357
Bye I love you.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.060
- That was really special.

08:47.060 --> 08:47.894

08:47.894 --> 08:48.728
- So much support.

08:48.728 --> 08:49.863
- [Icesis Couture] I know.

08:52.665 --> 08:53.500
And we're done.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.300
- Yeah, yeah.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.703
- Don't worry Pythia, we
didn't forget about you.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.171
Look who's waiting.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.674
- Oh, Jeffrey, oh my God.

09:01.674 --> 09:04.277
- [Jeffrey] Hey! Long time, no
see.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.779
- [Pythia] Oh my God. I'm
sorry. I couldn't be there

09:05.779 --> 09:06.613
for this.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.082
- I'm great. Don't worry about
the eye.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.384
- He looked so cute. He
just had his surgery.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.987
I'm so sad that I can't be
there to like take care of him.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.188
- [Jeffrey] I miss you so much.

09:15.188 --> 09:18.191
You have no idea how proud I
am of you right now, Christos.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.160
You've worked so hard for this
and I mean,

09:20.160 --> 09:21.961
you're probably the most
deserving person

09:21.961 --> 09:24.764
and honestly, I am so
grateful to be on this journey

09:24.764 --> 09:27.500
with you and I can't wait
for you to be back home.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.805
- I miss you so much. I
can't wait to see you again.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.072
I'm doing this for you.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.207
- [Jeffrey] The only important
thing

09:34.207 --> 09:36.309
is that you fucking win.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.878
We need that tiara, we need that
scepter.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.647
(laughing)

09:40.647 --> 09:42.649
Oh, and a $100.000, I mean, why
not?

09:42.649 --> 09:44.851
- Oh yeah. That'll be a plus.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.086
Bye bye, love you so much. I
miss you.

09:47.086 --> 09:47.921
- Bye.

09:49.856 --> 09:50.824
- Oh my God.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.959
- [Traci Melchor] Thank
you to our friends at Fido.

09:52.959 --> 09:56.196
I hope that filled up your
love tanks and gave each of you

09:56.196 --> 09:59.232
enough fuel to cross the finish
line.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.667
- [Pythia] Like these
people are our rocks, right?

10:00.667 --> 10:02.001
They ground us and they help us.

10:02.001 --> 10:05.071
And they have made us the people
that we are today in a way.

10:05.071 --> 10:08.475
So it's so special to see
everyone reconnected really like

10:08.475 --> 10:10.443
rekindled the fire inside of us.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.678
- All right, queens.

10:11.678 --> 10:14.581
It's time to take a trip down
memory lane,

10:14.581 --> 10:16.583
back to high school.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.984
- Oh my gosh.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.385
- [Traci Melchor] Were
you the teacher's pet,

10:19.385 --> 10:20.787
the class clown?

10:20.787 --> 10:23.990
Or did you spend your days
playing hooky?

10:23.990 --> 10:24.958
Get nookie.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.828
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] No matter
which clique you belong to.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.497
For weirdos like us,

10:30.497 --> 10:34.334
living our authentic
truths was not always easy.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.871
And for some, it was a
time they'd like to forget.

10:37.871 --> 10:42.208
However, the times, they are
a-changing.

10:42.208 --> 10:47.213
Now, many 2SLGBTQI+ high
schoolers are finding their
voices

10:47.814 --> 10:50.517
and are proudly stepping out of
the closet

10:50.517 --> 10:51.918
for all of their peers to see.

10:51.918 --> 10:52.919
- Yay!

10:52.919 --> 10:56.055
- Which brings us to this
week's maxi challenge.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.858
Please help me welcome
to the workroom, Ethan,

11:01.394 --> 11:03.029
Friday,

11:03.029 --> 11:04.597
Mikayla,

11:04.597 --> 11:06.032
Alex, and Clover.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.103
- Hello and welcome to the work
room.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.204
- [Group] Hi!

11:12.839 --> 11:14.641
- [Adriana] I miss having that
skin.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.212
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes]
These five teens are proof

11:19.212 --> 11:21.281
that it not only gets better,

11:21.281 --> 11:23.883
but baby it's already gotten
better.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.686
- [Traci Melchor] Each of
you will play chaperone

11:26.686 --> 11:30.256
and escort them to the
draggiest prom ever.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.125
- A queer prom!

11:32.125 --> 11:34.961
- [Pythia] This couldn't have
happened when I went to prom.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.897
I felt like I couldn't be
myself when I graduated,

11:37.897 --> 11:39.532
I didn't wear the things
that I wanted to wear.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.768
I didn't go to prom with who I
wanted to.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.670
- [Traci Melchor] It's up to
you to give your new daughter

11:43.670 --> 11:47.006
a drag make-over worthy of a
prom queen.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.242
- You will create their
looks using products

11:49.242 --> 11:52.845
from the spectacular Shoppers
Drug Mart beauty display.

11:52.845 --> 11:55.214
And we want your runway to tell
a story.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.051
So you will be judged on how
well you bring your teen's

11:58.051 --> 12:00.186
prom fantasy to life.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.154
- [Traci Melchor] And I should
mention,

12:01.154 --> 12:04.357
you'll also be making
their outfits from scratch.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.158
- Again?

12:05.158 --> 12:07.060
- [Icesis Couture] It's
another design challenge!

12:07.060 --> 12:09.796
(screaming)

12:09.796 --> 12:11.030
- But fear not,

12:11.030 --> 12:13.833
you can help yourself to
fabrics from the fabulous

12:13.833 --> 12:15.168
Fabricland wall.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.270
They have everything you need to
turn out

12:17.270 --> 12:18.404
a winning look.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.574
As well, wigs for your
teens have been provided

12:21.574 --> 12:24.444
by our friends at Wigs & Grace.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.578
- Teenyboppers,

12:25.578 --> 12:28.581
to help you prepare for
your main stage debut,

12:28.581 --> 12:31.351
you'll get a little
coaching session from me.

12:33.186 --> 12:37.256
That's right. Brooke Lynn's
drag academy is now open.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.492
- [Traci Melchor] Kendall
Gender,

12:39.492 --> 12:42.195
as the winner of last
week's maxi challenge,

12:42.195 --> 12:44.230
you'll assign the duos.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.064
- Oh!

12:45.932 --> 12:48.201
- [Traci Melchor] So who's
sending whom to prom?

12:48.201 --> 12:51.037
- I'm going to choose you my
dear,

12:51.037 --> 12:52.005
because as soon as you walked
in,

12:52.005 --> 12:54.107
this kind of looks like a mini
me already.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.342
- You're right!

12:56.342 --> 12:58.244
- He's a little bit more pretty
than me

12:58.244 --> 12:59.212
and younger obviously.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.046
- Oh no.

13:00.046 --> 13:00.880
(laughing)

13:00.880 --> 13:02.415
- [Kendall Gender] Ethan, Gia.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.349
- [Gia Metric] Yay!

13:04.550 --> 13:05.852
- [Kendall Gender] I want
these teams to have the

13:05.852 --> 13:09.188
best time ever. So I'm
assigning them with people

13:09.188 --> 13:11.758
that I think will bring
out the best in them.

13:11.758 --> 13:12.592
Adriana.

13:14.193 --> 13:16.329
I think I'm going to
do Mikayla with Icesis.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.900
- Hi, how are you?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.337
- [Kendall Gender] You too
look like you would be friends

13:24.337 --> 13:25.171
outside of this.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.639
- I was just thinking.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.074
I love your outfit.

13:28.074 --> 13:28.908
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes]
Well, that was a very

13:28.908 --> 13:29.876
Canadian pairing.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.878
- I'm the nice one, I'm
congenial, babe.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.214
- Now remember, this
challenge is all about playing

13:35.214 --> 13:36.416
fairy drag mother.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.519
And helping these teen
sensations achieve their
ultimate

13:39.519 --> 13:40.820
prom drag fantasy.

13:42.021 --> 13:45.024
- [Together] Racers, start your
engines.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.959
And may the best team win.

13:47.794 --> 13:50.396
(screaming)

13:50.396 --> 13:51.564
- For this week's maxi
challenge,

13:51.564 --> 13:55.902
we are giving full drag
make-overs to our teens.

13:55.902 --> 13:58.938
But the catch is we also
have to make the outfit

13:58.938 --> 14:01.207
from head to toe.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.975
When you walked through
that room I was like,

14:02.975 --> 14:04.977
what the hell is going on?

14:04.977 --> 14:07.547
It's like looking into
a younger mirror, girl.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.115
- I was hoping for you.

14:09.115 --> 14:09.949
- I mean duh.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.984
- I was like, not this woman.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.087
- I saw your outfit and I was
like,

14:14.087 --> 14:16.022
God, I hope I get this person.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.123
- Well here we are.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.458
- Have you been to prom before?

14:18.458 --> 14:21.127
- I've never been to prom.
I'm graduating this year.

14:21.127 --> 14:24.063
And COVID ruined our prom,
so I won't be having a prom.

14:24.063 --> 14:25.064
But this is my prom now.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.065
- Yes!

14:26.065 --> 14:28.701
- The history of prom
is actually like really

14:28.701 --> 14:29.602
heteronormative.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.436
- Yes.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.804
- There's a lot of
pressure to like, conform.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.172
This is the opposite of that.

14:33.172 --> 14:36.008
- My drag, to its core,
is very genderfied.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.610
Like sometimes I don't
pad, sometimes I have my

14:37.610 --> 14:41.114
hairy chest out, sometimes I
do clown make-up, club kid.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.315
- Oh my gosh, I love that.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.683
- [Icesis Couture]
Sometimes, I'm a beautiful

14:43.683 --> 14:45.351
glamorous woman, and
that's okay too, right.

14:45.351 --> 14:46.652
You can just be whoever
you want with drag.

14:46.652 --> 14:50.656
- I kind of liked deconstructing
the traditional silhouettes

14:50.656 --> 14:52.625
and then mishmash it back
together.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.328
- I really, really want to
give them a very special night,

14:55.328 --> 14:56.829
something that will stand out.

14:56.829 --> 15:00.266
Something that they will feel
so comfortable and happy in.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.136
- I would see you in a long
dress.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.338
Would that be okay with you?

15:05.338 --> 15:07.173
- I think showing some leg would
be nice.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.808
As a person whose non-binary,

15:08.808 --> 15:10.910
I just feel like I never
actually fit in,

15:10.910 --> 15:14.180
but like I see myself sexy.

15:14.180 --> 15:18.050
I like plastic. I just
feel like a plastic girl.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.853
- They want to serve body

15:20.853 --> 15:24.957
and I am living for it
because I serve body.

15:24.957 --> 15:28.427
- I've been doing drag
since I was in grade nine.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.263
- What made you want
to take drag seriously?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.131
- Prior to me coming out as
trans,

15:32.131 --> 15:34.534
I was doing a lot of drag
related stuff

15:34.534 --> 15:36.235
because it just felt like home.

15:36.235 --> 15:39.338
- My drag mother is trans
and I also have a trans

15:39.338 --> 15:40.173
drag daughter

15:40.173 --> 15:41.073
- [Mikayla] Oh my God.

15:41.073 --> 15:42.675
- I'm so happy that you're here.

15:42.675 --> 15:43.910
And I'm so happy that you're
mine.

15:43.910 --> 15:47.280
So this challenge is prom.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.050
- I always like envisioned
a sparkly red dress.

15:51.050 --> 15:54.921
I feel like red compliments
my skin so well.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.656
So if we have almost like a ball
gown.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.524
- [Icesis Couture] Mine's a
little bit like show girly,

15:58.524 --> 16:00.159
but we don't have to match.

16:00.159 --> 16:02.929
So if you really just want
your prom fantasy to be

16:02.929 --> 16:06.332
whatever color it is,
I want you to be happy.

16:06.332 --> 16:07.767
- When you think about yourself
in drag,

16:07.767 --> 16:09.669
are you thinking about like
this sort of character?

16:09.669 --> 16:11.170
Like, who is she?

16:11.170 --> 16:14.941
- I'm thinking glamorous.
I'm thinking expensive.

16:14.941 --> 16:17.310
- Oh honey. He is expensive.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.513
- Expensive, shiny, Kim K's wet
look.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.347
- Girl.

16:21.347 --> 16:22.315
- Do you remember that?

16:22.315 --> 16:23.149
- Girl!

16:23.149 --> 16:25.618
My fucking drag name is Kendall
Gender,

16:25.618 --> 16:29.522
you think I don't know the
fucking Mugler fantasy bitch?

16:29.522 --> 16:32.725
Alex must have come from my
dreams, honey.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.828
You say Kim K? I say, okay,
bitch.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.397
Are you already my child?

16:38.397 --> 16:40.499
- Since I've never done
something like this,

16:40.499 --> 16:41.334
if I'm going to be a girl,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.336
I want to be the one
that everybody's looking.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.470
I want to be glamorous.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.304
- Okay.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.372
- [Ethan] I want to be super
pretty.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.107
I want like a nice dress.

16:48.107 --> 16:49.675
- God, you're speaking my
language.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.843
- Exactly.

16:50.843 --> 16:54.480
- As soon as anyone says the
word pretty, I'm like, who me?

16:54.480 --> 16:57.116
I was like, well, we're going
to talk about being beautiful.

16:57.116 --> 17:00.286
This is a design challenge
and I am not afraid.

17:00.286 --> 17:03.656
The growth from week one to the
ball,

17:03.656 --> 17:07.994
we are going to make
Ethan the most beautiful

17:07.994 --> 17:09.729
ball gown ever.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.231
So this, yeah.

17:12.231 --> 17:15.034
And like, you can like
really just, there we go.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.603
Ethan is a drag baby.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.572
He has never been in drag.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.207
He has never worn heels.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.174
- Then look back.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.310
- Oh my God.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.812
(laughing)

17:26.812 --> 17:28.614
Oh my gosh, she's a model.

17:28.614 --> 17:29.482
- I am, actually.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.286
- Well, so am I, okay.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.487
Don't take that away from me.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.789
- Well, we'll go to the
balls together, mother.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.858
- They're like photo
shoots that we can do.

17:40.626 --> 17:41.661
- What do you prefer?

17:42.795 --> 17:43.663
(gasping)

17:43.663 --> 17:44.497
- This.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.400
- That one? Okay good,
we can go with that one.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.801
- [Kendall Gender] She's a
theater girl.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.102
Less arms.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.138
(laughing)

17:52.138 --> 17:53.973
Just a little bit less arms.

17:53.973 --> 17:57.243
- [Icesis Couture] Oh, oh! Okay,
okay.

17:59.145 --> 18:02.448
Not a teen showing up
already a drag queen,

18:02.448 --> 18:04.383
with her Merc in the parking
lot.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.419
So we don't need to worry
about you in heels, do we?

18:06.419 --> 18:07.253
- We don't.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.087
- No we don't.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.989
She really said I'm on Canada's
Drag Race,

18:09.989 --> 18:11.724
as contestant number 13.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.993
Does your girl want some help?

18:13.993 --> 18:14.961
- Yes.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.196
(laughing)

18:18.864 --> 18:20.533
- [Pythia] I'm so happy that
you're actually part of this,

18:20.533 --> 18:23.602
with me. It's like non-binary
bodies. Like we're able to,

18:23.602 --> 18:25.604
you know what I mean? To
showcase the world that it's,

18:25.604 --> 18:27.807
it's not just this gay men that
do this.

18:27.807 --> 18:31.877
I perform in underground clubs
in Montreal with drag kings,

18:31.877 --> 18:36.315
trans queens, non-binary
folk, drag things, monsters.

18:36.315 --> 18:39.018
And I want to show them that
there's a whole new world

18:39.018 --> 18:40.486
that they didn't know existed.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.254
This is a possibility for them
too,

18:42.254 --> 18:43.990
they could probably do it in the
future.

18:45.157 --> 18:46.892
- Greetings, loved ones.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.794
- Hi!

18:49.829 --> 18:50.830
- Hello, hello.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.198
Hi Gia.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.966
How's everything going
with your drag daughter?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.935
- Oh, we are having so much fun.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.103
- Do we have a name yet?

18:57.103 --> 18:59.605
- Electric Metric.

18:59.605 --> 19:00.439
- Done.

19:00.439 --> 19:01.273
- Right?

19:01.273 --> 19:02.308
- Like mic drop.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.142
- [Gia Metric] Yes!

19:03.142 --> 19:04.176
And these are the fabrics.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.178
- [Traci Melchor] So pretty,
what a gorgeous color.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.347
- [Gia Metric] One of his
favorite colors is purple.

19:08.347 --> 19:12.551
So we are going with a
purple electric theme.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.620
- The makeup is also a big
part of this challenge.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.689
Are you used to painting
other people's faces?

19:16.689 --> 19:17.656
- [Gia Metric] I've done it a
few times.

19:17.656 --> 19:21.227
Good thing is that we
almost kind of look alike,

19:21.227 --> 19:24.430
so we have like similar bone
structure.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.866
So I have confidence
that I'll be able to like

19:26.866 --> 19:31.170
pull off that glamorous prom
look with Electric Metric.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.438
- [Traci Melchor] I'll
see you two at prom.

19:32.438 --> 19:34.640
- [Gia Metric] Yes!
Thank you so much, love.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.012
- [Traci Melchor] Hello, hello.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.013
You look very excited.

19:41.013 --> 19:41.847
- [Kendall Gender] We are
honestly

19:41.847 --> 19:43.115
a little match made in heaven.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.316
- [Alex] We both have an
obsession,

19:44.316 --> 19:46.986
turns out with Kim K's Met Gala
wet look.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.522
- That was kind of like
where we're basing it off of.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.456
- Do we have a drag name yet?

19:50.456 --> 19:51.390
- Please introduce yourself.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.426
Please welcome to the stage.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.260
- Stormi.

19:55.327 --> 19:56.829
(laughing)

19:56.829 --> 19:58.464
- With an 'i'? Yes.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.467
- [Kendall Gender] Alex's
drag name is Stormi Gender.

20:01.467 --> 20:05.771
And it's a take on Kylie
Jenner's actual child's name.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.473
And then we're going with the
storm,

20:07.473 --> 20:08.774
the wetness it's,

20:08.774 --> 20:11.477
it's very conceptual honey.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.680
- Kendall, how confident are
you with the design challenge?

20:14.680 --> 20:17.516
- Honestly, not super
confident with designing.

20:17.516 --> 20:19.118
It's not in my skillset.

20:19.118 --> 20:20.386
Unfortunately I was in the
bottom

20:20.386 --> 20:21.720
for the last design challenge.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.555
I want to step up.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.790
I came off of a really good high
last week

20:24.790 --> 20:26.459
and it's making me feel
confident.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.094
- Well, I'll see you at prom.

20:28.961 --> 20:29.929
I can't wait.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.669
I'm feeling the heat.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.171
I'm feeling the heat from that
walk.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.005
- You feel it?

20:40.005 --> 20:40.906
- How are you feeling, fabulous?

20:40.906 --> 20:43.008
- I feel amazing.

20:43.008 --> 20:44.777
And being here with Icesis is
like,

20:45.678 --> 20:47.012
I like I'm loving it.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.781
- So let's talk about the look.

20:48.781 --> 20:52.518
- She really wanted the color
red, red is just going to pop.

20:52.518 --> 20:55.287
So even if the silhouette is
simpler.

20:55.287 --> 20:56.589
- But when we think about
Icesis,

20:56.589 --> 20:58.157
we don't usually think about
simple.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.025
- [Icesis Couture] Yes, but
I'm also here to show variety.

21:00.025 --> 21:00.860
- Okay.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.094
- [Icesis Couture] I
have showed you weird,

21:02.094 --> 21:03.863
I've shown you like pretty,

21:03.863 --> 21:06.565
I haven't had a sexy moment.

21:06.565 --> 21:07.967
I'd love to share with her.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.235
- [Traci Melchor] You're
in such good hands.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.069
- [Mikayla] Yeah.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.771
- I mean Icesis, you've
won two design challenges.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.241
- Designing is what I do.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.676
I've never made a prom dress
before,

21:17.676 --> 21:20.246
but I know how to put somebody
together.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.748
- Hi Traci.

21:22.748 --> 21:23.849
- [Traci Melchor] Clover, how
you doing?

21:23.849 --> 21:25.217
- I'm doing so good.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.253
I think this is like a perfect
fit.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.688
- Oh. A match made in hell. It's
perfect.

21:29.688 --> 21:30.990
- What makes it so perfect?

21:30.990 --> 21:34.193
- [Clover] We both had a
similar approach that we wanted

21:34.193 --> 21:35.027
to take with this.

21:35.027 --> 21:39.131
- We both identify as non
binary and we really wanted to

21:39.131 --> 21:41.467
bring that sort of gender
fuck aspect of my drag

21:41.467 --> 21:43.669
into the main stage.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.237
- So when we say gender fuck,

21:45.237 --> 21:46.805
describe what that's gonna look
like.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.908
- [Pythia] I'm going to go with
more of like a goth glamor,

21:48.908 --> 21:51.143
a deconstructed sort of like
tuxedo,

21:51.143 --> 21:53.712
that's both like a very
feminine and masculine shape.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.481
She's going to be wearing pants
and like,

21:55.481 --> 21:57.416
she's going to be wearing
more like a fitted dress.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.652
So she's going to be a cool goth
mom.

21:59.652 --> 22:03.122
I will have to escort
Clover to the prom so

22:03.122 --> 22:05.391
I will be taking it on
myself to make myself

22:05.391 --> 22:07.459
a whole new look to match
theirs.

22:07.459 --> 22:08.894
- [Traci Melchor] Did you
say you're going to create

22:08.894 --> 22:10.763
a second look for yourself?

22:10.763 --> 22:11.597
- Yes.

22:11.597 --> 22:12.431
- That sounds like a lot of
work.

22:12.431 --> 22:13.966
- Oh my God. It's a lot of work.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.801
It's going to be quite intense.

22:15.801 --> 22:16.635
I'm just going to go for it

22:16.635 --> 22:18.971
and pray that we can finish in
time.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.606
- Good luck.

22:20.606 --> 22:22.341
(bright music)

22:22.341 --> 22:24.810
- [Traci Melchor] Friday and
Adriana.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.545
My favorite day of the week.

22:26.545 --> 22:27.379
- It is.

22:27.379 --> 22:28.881
- [Traci Melchor] This
fabric has caught my eye.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.749
- We were so happy when we found
it.

22:30.749 --> 22:33.352
I'm going to go with slick
body-ody.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.487
- Oh yeah, body-ody.

22:35.487 --> 22:38.057
- Yes, look at that body, I
mean.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.758
- How do you feel about
this whole vision, Friday?

22:39.758 --> 22:40.593
- [Friday] I love it.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.861
I've always dreamed of having
a prom where I could like,

22:42.861 --> 22:45.197
have like a beautiful dress and
just like,

22:45.197 --> 22:47.266
make everyone faint when they
look at me.

22:47.266 --> 22:50.536
So, I'm so excited to just serve
this high-fashion realness.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.005
- [Adriana] I am giving
you that high fashion prom

22:53.005 --> 22:55.674
that you want. You are getting
everything,

22:55.674 --> 22:57.343
my little daughter.

22:57.343 --> 22:59.378
- Teens and queens, listen up.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.248
It's going to be a family
affair tomorrow on the runway.

23:02.248 --> 23:06.085
And we'll be joined by
extra special guest judge,

23:06.085 --> 23:07.853
Quebecois icon, Mitsou.

23:10.422 --> 23:13.826
- [Adriana] A Quebecois is
in the judging panel. Yes!

23:13.826 --> 23:15.761
Mitsou is an icon from Quebec.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.630
If a Mitsou song plays in the
club,

23:17.630 --> 23:22.334
you are gonna hear that dance
floor sing their lungs loud.

23:22.334 --> 23:25.471
- Good luck. And don't fuck it
up.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.839
- Thank you.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.341
- [Traci Melchor] Bye kittens.

23:30.476 --> 23:31.310
- Oh, hi.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.481
- [Kendall Gender] It is
time for our teenyboppers

23:35.481 --> 23:38.217
to get a coaching lesson from
Brooke Lynn.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.918
I want a coaching lesson from
Brooke Lynn

23:39.918 --> 23:41.620
on walking the fucking runway.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.523
Where was that week one?

23:44.523 --> 23:47.126
- Welcome drag babies to
the Brooke Lynn Hytes'

23:47.126 --> 23:48.694
academy of drag.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.696
Now I hear you've all been
practicing,

23:50.696 --> 23:52.965
but mama's here to show you how
it's done.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.670
We hit the mark.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.371
We go over here.

23:59.371 --> 24:01.206
We say hello to the judges.

24:01.206 --> 24:02.675
We model the garment again.

24:02.675 --> 24:05.678
We walk back to the center
and don't cut the corners,

24:05.678 --> 24:07.513
ladies, I'm looking at you.

24:07.513 --> 24:09.782
- [Pythia] I have been sawing
past these

24:09.782 --> 24:13.218
corners for so long. I do
not stop. I don't pose.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.587
- Ta-da!

24:15.587 --> 24:17.022
(clapping)

24:17.022 --> 24:19.391
On this runway, it is
all about confidence.

24:19.391 --> 24:20.693
If you aren't feeling yourself,

24:20.693 --> 24:22.127
we are going to feel you.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.829
Are you ready to strut your
stuff?

24:26.799 --> 24:28.600
- [Crowd] Oh, oh!

24:28.600 --> 24:30.035
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Straighten
those knees a little bit.

24:30.035 --> 24:33.172
Oh, do you see the body?

24:33.172 --> 24:34.606
This is definitely your child.

24:34.606 --> 24:36.642
- [Kendall Gender] I'm feeling
so happy

24:36.642 --> 24:39.778
about my pairing with
Alex. He is exactly like me

24:39.778 --> 24:41.547
as soon as he goes on stage

24:41.547 --> 24:43.148
and I can't wait to perform with
him.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.684
- Think of crossing the legs in
front.

24:46.752 --> 24:47.920
You're doing a great job.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.288
Is this is your first time ever
in heels?

24:49.288 --> 24:51.623
- [Alex] Maybe when I was seven,
I wore like princess heels.

24:51.623 --> 24:52.458
Like those rubber heels.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.727
- Well, join the fucking club,
we all did.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.195
(laughing)

24:56.195 --> 24:58.197
Oh, okay.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.500
Feel the fantasy.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.436
- [Icesis Couture] Her walk is
incredible.

25:04.436 --> 25:06.071
That was beautiful.

25:06.071 --> 25:06.905
- Thank you.

25:06.905 --> 25:07.706
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] One
thing I want to see from you

25:07.706 --> 25:09.608
is I want to see a little bit
more hip.

25:09.608 --> 25:11.276
Your mama has a stank walk,

25:11.276 --> 25:14.046
which means you got to have a
stank walk.

25:14.046 --> 25:14.880
There you go.

25:16.648 --> 25:17.649
Walk it, walk it.

25:17.649 --> 25:18.817
Feel it, feel it.

25:20.085 --> 25:22.855
- [Icesis Couture] I am
already confident. We got this.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.556
- So your mom was a supermodel.

25:24.556 --> 25:26.024
You have some big shoes to fill.

25:26.024 --> 25:27.793
Literally and figuratively.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.129
I want panther on the runway.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.831
Sensual, sensuous.

25:32.831 --> 25:36.101
All right. All right.
You got the attitude.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.837
- [Gia Metric] It is the
first time my baby Electric

25:38.837 --> 25:40.739
is walking the runway.

25:40.739 --> 25:43.776
- No hunching over. Shoulders
back, tits out for the boys.

25:43.776 --> 25:44.777
Now let's see again, come on.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.012
- [Gia Metric] I can tell
that she's a little nervous,

25:47.012 --> 25:50.215
but Electric has the Metric
genes.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.884
- We're a model, aren't we?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.619
She's waving to her fans.

25:53.619 --> 25:54.686
(laughing)

25:54.686 --> 25:55.988
- I'm a little nervous.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.589
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] That's
okay. Let's see what you got.

25:57.589 --> 25:59.191
- You can do it baby.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.959
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Yeah. All
right.

26:00.959 --> 26:02.361
- My shoe's falling off.

26:02.361 --> 26:03.195
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] It's okay.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.997
- They haven't really worn heels
before.

26:04.997 --> 26:08.367
- Don't do robot arms.
Let them relax. Have fun.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.302
- [Pythia] I'm quite nervous.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.104
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Oh, oh.
Oh!

26:12.104 --> 26:14.973
She said we're gonna go
backwards.

26:14.973 --> 26:15.808
Yes!

26:17.409 --> 26:18.777
- [Crowd] Yes!

26:18.777 --> 26:20.779
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes]
Give us that attitude.

26:20.779 --> 26:22.448
Don't look down, they're
not going anywhere.

26:22.448 --> 26:23.282
And serve.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.919
It's okay, it's okay.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.555
- [Adriana] Bella Donna is
not walking in very easy heels

26:29.555 --> 26:30.389
right now.

26:30.389 --> 26:31.990
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Legs for
days.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.926
- [Adriana] But we're gonna work
with it

26:33.926 --> 26:38.130
and I'm going to make sure that
they are comfortable on them

26:38.130 --> 26:39.898
and they do not trip.

26:39.898 --> 26:41.033
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] I can
tell you're not very comfortable

26:41.033 --> 26:42.067
walking in heels. So I want to,

26:42.067 --> 26:44.937
I want you to take your
time. You can walk slowly.

26:44.937 --> 26:48.540
There's nothing wrong with
the slow sensual runaway walk.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.576
Your drag mother is very
sensual.

26:51.477 --> 26:56.048
So much better, so much
better. Thank you, Bella Donna.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.484
- [Adriana] Come on, Bella
Donna.

26:58.484 --> 26:59.318
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Drag
babies,

26:59.318 --> 27:02.421
I cannot wait to see you all
transform into prom queens

27:02.421 --> 27:05.390
tomorrow, right here on the main
stage.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.526
Prom is the most magical
night of your life

27:07.526 --> 27:09.628
that you will remember forever.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.365
So make it count. We'll see you
later.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.601
- Thank you so much.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.611
- [Adriana] It's prom night
tonight

27:25.611 --> 27:27.145
and we're giving you the
queerest,

27:27.145 --> 27:32.217
the most fantastic prom
you've ever seen in your life.

27:32.217 --> 27:33.852
- [Gia Metric] I have
to get my look together.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.555
I have to do Ethan's makeup.
I have to do my makeup.

27:36.555 --> 27:40.025
We have to come up with
a mother daughter story

27:40.025 --> 27:43.595
and we have to perform on the
runway.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.738
Drag is a little uncomfortable,
giving you a heads up.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.241
- [Pythia] I think I'm the
only one who has to make

27:56.241 --> 27:59.177
two costumes, so I'm a little
behind.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.280
What if we put it on last
minute and it doesn't work?

28:01.280 --> 28:03.615
What if my dress doesn't
fit? What if it rips?

28:03.615 --> 28:05.317
I am rushing so much to make
this work.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.986
So any little mistake could
send me in the bottom.

28:09.121 --> 28:12.057
- I'm really excited to see
what I look like in drag.

28:12.057 --> 28:14.326
- Basically what I'm
doing is, I'm building up

28:14.326 --> 28:17.062
the outer corner of your eye.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.498
So that's going to give you
depth.

28:19.498 --> 28:22.134
I feel confident doing
someone else's makeup.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.769
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

28:25.671 --> 28:27.806
- Urban Decay, all nighter
setting spray,

28:27.806 --> 28:29.274
my literal favorite.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.144
And what kind of look are we
doing?

28:32.144 --> 28:35.380
I'm thinking like brown
eyeshadows because

28:35.380 --> 28:37.482
she loves the sexy look.

28:37.482 --> 28:39.785
I love using brand new brushes.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.555
- [Pythia] You know, it's so
crazy

28:43.555 --> 28:46.325
to know that you guys get
to live your truest selves.

28:46.325 --> 28:47.159
In high school,

28:47.159 --> 28:50.329
I didn't really feel as
comfortable back then.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.564
You know, there was a lot
of like internalized hate.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.166
- I created this club in my
school.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.068
It's called Love Yourself,
Love Others club.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.537
I wanted to make a space for
people

28:58.537 --> 29:03.141
because when I was personally
discovering who I was,

29:03.141 --> 29:04.676
I felt like I had nobody to talk
to

29:04.676 --> 29:06.178
and I felt completely alone.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.680
I'm very grateful that
I had the opportunity

29:08.680 --> 29:10.248
to make that space for myself

29:10.248 --> 29:12.184
and make that space for other
people too.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.252
- It's so cool to see the
dedication

29:14.252 --> 29:15.120
that these children have

29:15.120 --> 29:16.755
to making a better future for
everyone.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.992
- In my school, I was
lucky enough to have a GSA.

29:19.992 --> 29:23.595
We were able to get a few
gender neutral bathrooms

29:23.595 --> 29:26.031
and like create a safe
space at the school, right?

29:26.031 --> 29:27.399
- So you worked for that?

29:27.399 --> 29:29.401
- [Friday] I like volunteered
like, once a week.

29:29.401 --> 29:33.005
- I just love hearing that
because I think that it's so

29:33.005 --> 29:36.508
important to have those
conversations

29:36.508 --> 29:40.779
and you are helping the ones
that are coming after you.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.280
- [Mikayla] When I was in grade
six,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.716
someone lit my locker on fire.

29:44.716 --> 29:45.550
- Are you serious?

29:45.550 --> 29:46.451
- [Mikayla] Yeah.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.285
- Why?

29:47.285 --> 29:48.487
- [Mikayla] Someone lit my
locker on fire.

29:48.487 --> 29:49.521
- For being hateful?

29:49.521 --> 29:52.157
- I think that's like when
I realized that I like,

29:52.157 --> 29:55.060
I'm very, very different
from everyone else.

29:55.060 --> 29:59.131
And like I'm alone in this
fight, but I don't want to,

29:59.131 --> 30:03.101
sorry. I don't want to feel
alone anymore.

30:03.101 --> 30:04.069
I want other-

30:04.069 --> 30:05.237
God, I'm sorry.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.206
I wasn't going to cry.

30:08.206 --> 30:12.277
- We didn't get to the eyelid.
We're fine. We're fine.

30:12.277 --> 30:14.179
- I understand what it's like to
be alone.

30:14.179 --> 30:16.815
And like, I don't want anyone
else

30:16.815 --> 30:18.417
to have to go through that.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.452
So if I can be there for someone
else,

30:20.452 --> 30:23.889
like I'm going to root for
you as much as possible.

30:23.889 --> 30:25.157
Um, yeah.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.360
- Listen to me, you're now a
part of the house of Couture.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.728
You'll never be alone.

30:29.728 --> 30:32.297
If you ever have any negative
thoughts, if there's any,

30:32.297 --> 30:35.033
anything, or if you literally
just want to talk to somebody

30:35.033 --> 30:36.668
before you leave, I will
give you my phone number,

30:36.668 --> 30:38.470
I'll give you all my contact
information.

30:38.470 --> 30:39.671
You're never going to be alone.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.073
Okay, ever again. I promise.

30:41.907 --> 30:45.911
My high school experience
wasn't as great either.

30:45.911 --> 30:48.547
You kind of expect being bullied
at school

30:48.547 --> 30:50.415
and you really just, when you
get home,

30:50.415 --> 30:52.284
you're expecting that to be a
safe place.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.319
And when the bullying just
continues,

30:54.319 --> 30:58.557
sometimes it just feels like
hopeless.

30:58.557 --> 31:02.160
The only place where I
felt like I had control

31:02.160 --> 31:04.296
was what I did with my body.

31:04.296 --> 31:09.334
So I decided to take it upon
myself

31:09.334 --> 31:11.203
to just like, you know,

31:12.137 --> 31:15.407
just like, girl it was just too
much.

31:15.407 --> 31:18.176
I allowed myself to get to the
point where

31:18.176 --> 31:20.345
I wanted to end my life.

31:20.345 --> 31:24.983
I woke up in a hospital

31:24.983 --> 31:29.254
and then I ended up being

31:31.590 --> 31:32.991
put away for awhile.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.327
Didn't see the outside world.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.795
I had a lot of therapists.

31:36.795 --> 31:39.798
I was being watched constantly.

31:39.798 --> 31:42.067
It was just, yeah.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.335
Bitch, it was, it was hard.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.570
And I completely get your
struggle.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.273
And I know the feeling of
like not wanting to be alone.

31:48.273 --> 31:49.374
So that's why I'm telling you.

31:49.374 --> 31:52.644
You will never be alone, okay? I
promise.

31:52.644 --> 31:56.114
I do not enjoy the things
that have happened to me,

31:56.114 --> 31:58.049
but I wouldn't take them back

31:58.049 --> 32:00.152
because I love the person that I
am today.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.523
- Okay so I'll start
by your foundation now.

32:04.523 --> 32:07.692
- So I've never really
done foundation stuff.

32:07.692 --> 32:09.961
- It's a very high coverage
foundation,

32:09.961 --> 32:13.198
but it's very light for people
with more sensitive skin.

32:13.198 --> 32:14.232
I used to work at a makeup
counter

32:14.232 --> 32:17.536
so I did a lot of people's
makeup for prom actually.

32:17.536 --> 32:21.039
- [Adriana] I am not a
makeup artist like Pythia,

32:21.039 --> 32:24.943
but I think that I do pretty
good makeup.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.712
- [Mikayla] Teenyboppers.
How are you guys feeling?

32:27.712 --> 32:29.614
- [Alex] I'm feeling hotter than
you.

32:31.049 --> 32:31.883
- Girl.

32:31.883 --> 32:32.717
- The delusion is real.

32:32.717 --> 32:33.552
- You don't compare.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.320
- Very Kendall, Kendall
confidence.

Oh, look, it's my dream
queen Traci Melchor.

33:14.893 --> 33:17.262
Traci, may I have this dance?

33:17.262 --> 33:19.130
- Only if it's a slow one,

33:26.004 --> 33:27.138
- Hi Brooke Lynn.

33:27.138 --> 33:28.840
- Did you get lucky on prom
night?

33:28.840 --> 33:31.476
- No. I was saving myself for
marriage

33:31.476 --> 33:33.879
or for somebody to be
interested in me, but.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.413
(laughing)

33:35.413 --> 33:39.117
- And it's French Canadian
pop princess, Mitsou.

33:39.117 --> 33:40.452
- Bonjour, my princess.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.654

younger.

- [Mitsou] Two words. Stage mom.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.942
- [Kendall Gender] She doesn't
care about being prom queen,

35:10.942 --> 35:13.912
she just wants to take selfies,

I'm not ashamed of saying
that I have a sex life.

what I call an overbearing mom.

We cannot have that.

feeling this teenage dream.

36:24.749 --> 36:28.553
- Apollo is wearing their
beautiful gender neutral suit.

36:28.553 --> 36:32.390
Lace, frills, there's
no one way to be queer.

36:32.390 --> 36:35.760
There's no one way to
go to prom and dress.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.462
I'm so happy to have made their
prom

36:37.462 --> 36:38.730
a special night to remember.

36:38.730 --> 36:41.099
No matter what happens,
I feel like I've won.

36:41.099 --> 36:43.601
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes]
Rock on, you crazy kids.

36:43.601 --> 36:46.938
And finally, Gia and Electric
Metric.

36:46.938 --> 36:52.077
- Let me just fix her corsage
and send her on her way.

36:52.077 --> 36:55.713
- [Brad Goreski] It's the
purple rain of Electric Metric.

36:55.713 --> 37:00.718
- The story is this proud mama
who saved up every last penny

37:01.719 --> 37:05.924
to make sure that her little
girl looked the most beautiful

37:05.924 --> 37:07.425
at her prom.

37:07.425 --> 37:11.429
No, honey, this is your
moment. Take the spotlight.

37:11.429 --> 37:13.398
Okay. I'll give them a little
walk.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.633
- [Brad Goreski] She doesn't
even go here.

37:15.633 --> 37:17.302
(laughing)

37:17.302 --> 37:22.006
- I might be a mom, but damn,
am I cool? I still got it.

37:22.006 --> 37:25.143
- [Mitsou] A cougar and her cub.

37:25.143 --> 37:27.612
- Mama is here, everybody.

37:27.612 --> 37:30.515
Don't we look stunning?

37:30.515 --> 37:33.718
I am such a proud mom.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.622
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Welcome
everyone.

37:37.622 --> 37:40.291
On behalf of all of us, may I
just say,

37:40.291 --> 37:42.527
you all look so incredible.

37:42.527 --> 37:46.498
And this was by far the queerest
prom I have ever been to.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.366
(cheering)

37:48.366 --> 37:51.536
It is now time for the judges
critiques.

37:51.536 --> 37:54.472
First up Icesis and Ruby
Couture.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.908
- Hello, hi everybody.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.677
- Ruby Couture. How do you feel
right now?

37:59.677 --> 38:01.713
- Well, first of all, I want to
see y'all.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.381
(laughing)

38:03.381 --> 38:05.016
Oh, you look so good!

38:06.284 --> 38:10.255
I feel amazing. I like feel so
beautiful.

38:10.255 --> 38:15.260
- Hear me when I say you are
an absolute goddess tonight.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.896
The hair, the makeup. You look
stunning.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.230
- [Brad Goreski] This looks like
something

38:19.230 --> 38:20.565
we would see on a red carpet.

38:20.565 --> 38:22.033
Like you look red carpet ready.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.736
- [Traci Melchor] You
had such a beautiful walk

38:24.736 --> 38:27.038
and a confidence and posing.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.073
And the fact that you couldn't
see,

38:29.073 --> 38:31.376
makes it all the more
incredible.

38:31.376 --> 38:34.012
- [Mitsou] I know you didn't
have a prom,

38:34.012 --> 38:38.550
but I think today you went
to the best school ever.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.619
- [Brad Goreski] Icesis,
you look gorgeous as well.

38:41.619 --> 38:44.689
We haven't seen you like
this yet in the competition.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.724
My only criticism is,

38:46.724 --> 38:49.827
is I'm having a hard
time still figuring out

38:49.827 --> 38:51.296
what this story is.

38:51.296 --> 38:55.633
- I am like an old dusty
show girl that just finished.

38:55.633 --> 38:57.969
And she is the prom girl.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.938
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] I
didn't get that on the runway.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.973
A large part of what we're
judging you on

39:01.973 --> 39:03.508
is runway presentation.

39:03.508 --> 39:07.478
And we needed that story of
a mother daughter connection.

39:07.478 --> 39:08.479
You don't have to look alike,

39:08.479 --> 39:11.049
but we have to understand the
story.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.383
But, fuck, you look good.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.187
Kendall and Stormi Gender.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.021
- Hi.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.057
- [Brad Goreski] How was
your first time in drag?

39:19.057 --> 39:21.759
- I feel so stunning.

39:21.759 --> 39:24.395
I mean, my feet are on fire.

39:24.395 --> 39:25.230
- Mood.

39:25.230 --> 39:27.332
- But I feel great. And
I felt super confident

39:27.332 --> 39:28.866
and she knew exactly what I
wanted

39:28.866 --> 39:30.568
and she pulled it off, so.

39:30.568 --> 39:33.338
- I got your story right
from the beginning.

39:33.338 --> 39:36.174
I knew exactly who both of you
were.

39:36.174 --> 39:41.179
I'm loving the Kim K wet
Met Gala inspired hair.

39:41.546 --> 39:44.048
- [Traci Melchor] The
way you painted Stormi,

39:44.048 --> 39:45.783
I mean there is a family
resemblance

39:45.783 --> 39:47.919
and I really, really like your
faces.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.254
- I like our faces too.

39:49.254 --> 39:51.022
(laughing)

39:51.022 --> 39:54.626
- I really love your
Bedrock meets Fifth Element

39:54.626 --> 39:56.294
meets Kris Jenner look.

39:56.294 --> 39:58.229
Something different that
we have not seen from you.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.330
It's a different silhouette.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.065
- [Brad Goreski] I think your
sewing is getting better.

40:01.065 --> 40:01.899
- I am trying.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.635
- [Brad Goreski] The
execution might not have been

40:03.635 --> 40:06.604
as polished as maybe you
would have wanted it to be,

40:06.604 --> 40:09.607
but you sold the
mother-daughter story to me.

40:09.607 --> 40:10.875
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] I had so
much fun

40:10.875 --> 40:11.976
watching the two of you.

40:11.976 --> 40:15.179
- [Mitsou] It is mind
blowing to ever think that

40:15.179 --> 40:17.515
it's the first time
that you're doing drag.

40:17.515 --> 40:19.183
So congratulations.

40:19.183 --> 40:20.184
- Thank you.

40:20.184 --> 40:23.488
- [Traci Melchor] Adriana
and Bella Donna. Gorgeous.

40:23.488 --> 40:25.089
Just stunning.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.758
Bella Donna, how are you
feeling?

40:26.758 --> 40:28.593
- I'm having so much fun,

40:28.593 --> 40:29.727
besides the heels.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.329
- Yes. Fair.

40:31.329 --> 40:32.597
- [Friday] And I just got to
like,

40:32.597 --> 40:34.198
have the prom I never had.

40:34.198 --> 40:36.467
- Bella Donna, you look
beautiful.

40:36.467 --> 40:38.670
I love the jewels. I love the
hair.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.405
The makeup is really beautiful

40:40.405 --> 40:43.408
and you were just shining out
there.

40:43.408 --> 40:44.809
- I love this dress so much.

40:44.809 --> 40:47.245
- I love the simplicity of
it. I love the cut of it.

40:47.245 --> 40:50.248
I love the color. I don't
see any kind of corset line

40:50.248 --> 40:53.184
or tightline or anything on
that. So good job on that.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.752
You also look beautiful.

40:54.752 --> 40:55.887
I really like this outfit.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.822
I love the naughty mommy thing.

40:57.822 --> 41:00.358
My problem comes in with the
presentation on the runway.

41:00.358 --> 41:01.793
I didn't really understand the
connection

41:01.793 --> 41:02.860
between the two of you.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.195
- [Brad Goreski] I wish
that you two kind of

41:04.195 --> 41:05.997
matched up a little bit more.

41:05.997 --> 41:10.301
- [Mitsou] Both looks are
amazing. Maybe more
individually.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.938
Adrianna, you were represented
very well.

41:13.938 --> 41:17.308
You're a Quebec mom and
you still have a sex life.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.576
(laughing)

41:18.576 --> 41:19.477
Right on.

41:20.978 --> 41:21.813
Good job.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.716
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Pythia and
Apollo.

41:24.716 --> 41:27.218
Tell me about your ultimate prom
fantasy.

41:27.218 --> 41:31.356
- In prom wear, you see
a very heteronormative

41:31.356 --> 41:34.859
idea of what a man should wear
and what a woman should wear.

41:34.859 --> 41:39.530
I had this fantasy of
deconstructing the gender roles

41:39.530 --> 41:40.798
in clothing.

41:40.798 --> 41:43.101
- It's a modern day queer prom.

41:43.101 --> 41:46.337
It's gender bending. It's
gender fuck and I love it.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.039
I also totally got the story.

41:48.039 --> 41:50.441
The minute you came out, I
was like, I know that lady.

41:50.441 --> 41:52.610
I know that over the
hill goth rocker chick

41:52.610 --> 41:54.645
who's like yeah I used
to party back in the day,

41:54.645 --> 41:55.880
I have a kid now.

41:55.880 --> 41:58.916
- This outfit that you've made
for Apollo,

41:58.916 --> 42:00.551
I mean, I would literally wear
it.

42:00.551 --> 42:03.221
The cap ruffle sleeves, the
blouse,

42:03.221 --> 42:06.090
the lace, the exaggerated french
cuff,

42:06.090 --> 42:07.291
it's just so cool.

42:07.291 --> 42:08.893
I feel like someone's
going to knock this off.

42:08.893 --> 42:10.461
It's really, really good.

42:10.461 --> 42:12.730
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes]
And it's going to be me.

42:12.730 --> 42:15.400
- [Traci Melchor] It was
such a joy to see both of you

42:15.400 --> 42:18.136
have that mother daughter
storyline.

42:18.136 --> 42:19.837
It was a maternal moment.

42:19.837 --> 42:22.206
- I wanted to give them the
perfect prom.

42:22.206 --> 42:25.243
Like, you know what I mean,
like.

42:25.243 --> 42:27.145
- [Traci Melchor] You being
here and you being on the stage,

42:27.145 --> 42:29.714
you're going to inspire
so many other teens

42:29.714 --> 42:30.748
to live their truth.

42:30.748 --> 42:31.582
- Yeah.

42:31.582 --> 42:35.520
- And you remind me so much of
my kid.

42:35.520 --> 42:40.525
Thank you for putting an
image in flesh, in heart

42:40.725 --> 42:45.730
and in soul, an idea. You're
making it real. Thank you.

42:46.597 --> 42:49.333
- [Clover] I feel so powerful.

42:49.333 --> 42:52.904
I really did not think that
drag could be something that

42:52.904 --> 42:54.138
I could see myself in.

42:54.138 --> 42:56.007
- Drag is for everybody.

42:56.007 --> 42:59.644
Everybody, every shape,
size, gender, whatever,

42:59.644 --> 43:00.812
drag is for you.

43:00.812 --> 43:03.147
- [Clover] I really like that
other people

43:03.147 --> 43:05.583
like me can see themselves in
drag

43:05.583 --> 43:08.453
and in queer culture and queer
history.

43:08.453 --> 43:09.287
- I'm gonna cry.

43:11.756 --> 43:14.625
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Gia
Metric and Electric Metric.

43:14.625 --> 43:16.294
- Electric, how are you feeling?

43:16.294 --> 43:17.695
- This is crazy.

43:17.695 --> 43:20.264
I never thought I would
be on a stage like this.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.866
And I am shook.

43:21.866 --> 43:25.503
- [Brad Goreski] You definitely
look like Gia's daughter,

43:25.503 --> 43:26.938
which is a huge compliment.

43:26.938 --> 43:29.740
I love this look. I think it's
so fun.

43:29.740 --> 43:33.945
I love the mismatch shoe. I
love the little illusion sleeve

43:33.945 --> 43:37.582
with the details on it.
It's purely Gia Metric.

43:37.582 --> 43:38.749
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] I love
this transformation for you.

43:38.749 --> 43:41.719
And I love the story the two
of you told on the runway.

43:41.719 --> 43:43.454
Woman who had a rough life

43:43.454 --> 43:45.056
and wanted better for her
daughter.

43:45.056 --> 43:46.190
And she tried to like push her

43:46.190 --> 43:47.725
and like make her the prom
queen.

43:47.725 --> 43:48.693
And I loved that.

43:48.693 --> 43:50.495
It was very drop dead gorgeous
to me.

43:50.495 --> 43:52.864
- [Mitsou] You were like
the prom queenderella.

43:53.764 --> 43:56.634
Perfect, perfect, perfect.
Perfect acting, you know,

43:56.634 --> 43:58.236
we were entertained.

43:58.236 --> 44:01.339
- I love that you let Electric
go first,

44:01.339 --> 44:03.107
which is something that
I would do as a mother.

44:03.107 --> 44:05.576
But then of course I would
come down like this too.

44:05.576 --> 44:09.647
I love the little hint of
purple, Gia, that connects you

44:09.647 --> 44:10.915
to your daughter.

44:10.915 --> 44:13.651
- I have to say your
look is bringing me back

44:13.651 --> 44:15.286
to my actual prom.

44:15.286 --> 44:20.291
I wore a purple faux fur
blazer that my mom made.

44:20.591 --> 44:23.327
I was the head of the
prom committee that year.

44:23.327 --> 44:26.597
And my night ended with me being
told

44:26.597 --> 44:29.534
that there were a group of
guys that wanted to beat me up.

44:29.534 --> 44:32.703
And so I left the gym and
that's how I left my prom.

44:32.703 --> 44:35.773
That was my entire high school
experience.

44:35.773 --> 44:40.044
So now seeing all of you
up here, living your truth,

44:40.044 --> 44:44.048
my mind is blown. How far we've
come and it does get better.

44:44.048 --> 44:47.285
And it makes me so happy to see
all of you

44:47.285 --> 44:48.953
being who you want to be.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.088
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Thank you
everyone.

44:51.088 --> 44:53.224
While you untuck in the
workroom,

44:53.224 --> 44:56.394
the judges will sign
each other's year books.

45:02.967 --> 45:04.969
- [Kendall Gender] I might
have to be lip syncing tonight.

45:04.969 --> 45:08.406
It all depends on what the
judges are gonna favor.

45:08.406 --> 45:11.175
Is it gonna be the dress
or the performance?

45:11.175 --> 45:12.577
It could go either way.

45:12.577 --> 45:17.682
- [Mikayla] We could never
picture this being our prom.

45:17.682 --> 45:19.684
I'm black, I grew up in the
hood,

45:19.684 --> 45:23.254
I never expected to be like
this.

45:23.254 --> 45:26.791
Like I feel so expensive, so
luxurious.

45:26.791 --> 45:30.328
And to be the face for like
so many other black trans

45:30.328 --> 45:33.497
kids around the world is like,

45:33.497 --> 45:37.001
that means so much to me because
I wish I had that, you know

45:37.001 --> 45:41.339
Just thank you, for all of
this, because I feel amazing

45:41.339 --> 45:44.575
- [Icesis Couture] If I have
to lip sync, I'm okay with that

45:44.575 --> 45:49.747
because she is happy and that
is all that matters, period.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.582
- [Gia Metric] How are
you feeling, my beautiful

45:51.582 --> 45:53.751
purple Electric dream?

45:53.751 --> 45:55.953
- I'm so inspired just
by being in this room

45:55.953 --> 45:58.055
with so many like-minded people.

45:58.055 --> 46:01.058
It was really important to me
to like show other people that

46:01.058 --> 46:03.427
no matter how insecure you
are with your sexuality,

46:03.427 --> 46:05.429
or like no matter who you are,

46:05.429 --> 46:07.765
you can still be yourself
authentically.

46:07.765 --> 46:10.935
- I think going to an all guy
school when I was younger,

46:10.935 --> 46:14.038
put a lot of internalized
homophobia in my mind

46:14.038 --> 46:17.441
and I always thought I couldn't
express myself with makeup

46:17.441 --> 46:20.544
or painting my nails. And now I
feel like

46:20.544 --> 46:22.146
all of you guys have
given me the confidence

46:22.146 --> 46:25.916
to just do whatever I want
because it doesn't matter how

46:25.916 --> 46:28.219
I look. I know I look
gorgeous right now. But,

46:30.621 --> 46:33.224
it just matters that I
do what I want to do.

46:34.258 --> 46:37.161
And thank you all for showing me
that.

46:37.161 --> 46:41.732
- I wish I had you guys as
role models when I was young.

46:41.732 --> 46:45.870
- Every single one of you
guys are the reason why we can

46:45.870 --> 46:48.539
like be here and do this.

46:48.539 --> 46:50.708
- [Clover] I think one thing
that's really beautiful

46:50.708 --> 46:53.911
about the LGBTQ community is you
find that

46:53.911 --> 46:58.282
support through seeing
ourselves in each other.

46:58.282 --> 47:02.586
Seeing myself in you and
seeing that I could do drag

47:02.586 --> 47:05.923
and I do have a place,
was so important to me

47:05.923 --> 47:07.458
and so beautiful.

47:07.458 --> 47:09.860
I won as soon as Kendall
paired us together.

47:11.362 --> 47:14.231
- Same, same. A 100%.

47:14.231 --> 47:19.236
- I am very concerned that I
have to lip sync for my life.

47:20.237 --> 47:23.908
But right now I just feel
the love in the room.

47:23.908 --> 47:25.242
- I walked into this show,

47:25.242 --> 47:28.412
not really having any
expectations.

47:28.412 --> 47:31.582
I was really just excited to
push myself

47:31.582 --> 47:34.385
out of my comfort zone and
really just be the superstar

47:34.385 --> 47:38.189
for like all the kids
who like, were like me.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.124
Oh God, tears.

47:40.124 --> 47:42.093
- [Adriana] You were
already a superstar before,

47:42.093 --> 47:44.295
but I just wanted you to feel
fantastic.

47:44.295 --> 47:46.831
And I think that I did.

47:46.831 --> 47:51.068
- I feel like Michelle Visage.
I look like Michelle Visage.

47:51.068 --> 47:52.436
- Cheers for queers.

47:54.805 --> 47:59.410
- So just between us prom
queens, what do we think?

47:59.410 --> 48:02.246
Let's start with Icesis and Ruby
Couture.

48:02.246 --> 48:04.982
- Icesis is such an incredible
designer.

48:04.982 --> 48:07.818
There were so many gorgeous
details in that gown.

48:07.818 --> 48:11.021
The pleating across the
bodice, the fringe along

48:11.021 --> 48:14.925
the hemline, the gloves.
However, in terms of what we
were

48:14.925 --> 48:17.294
hoping to see tonight on the
runway,

48:17.294 --> 48:20.030
it didn't check all the
boxes of the criteria.

48:20.030 --> 48:22.433
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] I
think Icesis only understood

48:22.433 --> 48:24.201
half of the assignment this
week.

48:24.201 --> 48:26.370
We are judging these
queens on the make-over

48:26.370 --> 48:29.173
of their daughters, but
we are also judging them

48:29.173 --> 48:32.376
on how they present themselves
as mother and daughter

48:32.376 --> 48:33.210
on the runway.

48:33.210 --> 48:35.045
- [Traci Melchor] They really
looked like fabulous friends,

48:35.045 --> 48:36.547
not really mother daughter.

48:36.547 --> 48:40.551
- It was the after prom.
It was the party bus.

48:40.551 --> 48:42.486
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes]
Kendall and Stormi Gender.

48:42.486 --> 48:44.955
- I really like the look
that Kendall gave Stormi.

48:44.955 --> 48:47.925
I saw the mother-daughter
connection.

48:47.925 --> 48:50.561
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] The look
for me was not my favorite

48:50.561 --> 48:51.395
of the night.

48:51.395 --> 48:53.397
- Yeah, it wasn't executed
perfectly,

48:53.397 --> 48:55.733
but I was so into their
performance,

48:55.733 --> 48:58.836
like you got the vibe right
away when she put the coat down

48:58.836 --> 49:00.871
on the ground, like, oh,
they're mother-daughter.

49:00.871 --> 49:03.340
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes]
Adrianna and Bella Donna.

49:03.340 --> 49:07.044
- [Traci Melchor] Adrianna's
real housewife slash latex

49:07.044 --> 49:09.980
cool mom serve was spectacular.

49:09.980 --> 49:14.385
Bella Donna's rose gold, sharp
shoulders, a strong shoulder

49:14.385 --> 49:16.220
look was so great.

49:16.220 --> 49:18.189
- But did you get
mother-daughter from them?

49:18.189 --> 49:19.256
- No.

49:19.256 --> 49:20.257
(laughing)

49:20.257 --> 49:21.859
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes]
Adrianna was giving us naughty

49:21.859 --> 49:24.328
vintage housewife and then
there was nothing vintage

49:24.328 --> 49:26.230
about that look that
Bella Donna was wearing.

49:26.230 --> 49:27.798
It looked like they were
just from different eras.

49:27.798 --> 49:29.800
- I thought Bella Donna looked
beautiful.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.169
I love the silhouette of the
gown.

49:32.169 --> 49:35.873
I did find, it didn't look
as polished as I wanted it to

49:35.873 --> 49:39.143
for somebody who I know, knows
how to sew.

49:39.143 --> 49:39.977
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] I don't
agree.

49:39.977 --> 49:42.413
It's a very thin four way
stretch fabric.

49:42.413 --> 49:43.914
And I was really impressed.

49:43.914 --> 49:47.718
- The hemline going up to the
slit, it was puckering a lot.

49:47.718 --> 49:49.520
- I disagree with you about
the hem because you're wrong.

49:49.520 --> 49:50.354
- [Brad Goreski] If
you stand up right now,

49:50.354 --> 49:51.856
we can see it around your hem
too.

49:51.856 --> 49:53.257
- Oh, you want to see around my
hem?

49:53.257 --> 49:56.927
Where, where? Where's the
puckering.

49:56.927 --> 50:00.064
- I'm not allowed to
put my hand under the-

50:00.064 --> 50:02.099
(laughing)

50:02.099 --> 50:03.801
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Pythia and
Apollo.

50:03.801 --> 50:06.237
- They knew the assignment.

50:06.237 --> 50:08.439
The design was incredible.

50:08.439 --> 50:11.709
The makeup was strong and
dramatic.

50:11.709 --> 50:13.444
I love the mustache.

50:13.444 --> 50:18.449
I was so happy that
Apollo's dream was realized.

50:18.782 --> 50:22.887
- What Pythia did is that
she listened to her kid.

50:22.887 --> 50:26.257
The way parents should
listen to their kids.

50:26.257 --> 50:30.794
- And together, their
story was very apparent.

50:30.794 --> 50:33.163
- I think this was an
incredible week for Pythia.

50:33.163 --> 50:36.367
Gia and Electric Metric.

50:36.367 --> 50:39.203
- Gia was in the bottom two
for our first design challenge

50:39.203 --> 50:43.807
and to get from there to here,
that gown looked fantastic.

50:43.807 --> 50:46.377
And it had Gia's sense of
humor, but the beauty was there.

50:46.377 --> 50:48.412
And the thing that I liked about
it is

50:48.412 --> 50:51.248
even though Gia looked
beautiful as her cool mom

50:51.248 --> 50:54.752
in that look, she really
allowed Electric to shine,

50:54.752 --> 50:58.622
which I know is not
inherent in her personality.

50:58.622 --> 51:00.457
- It's not her first go to, no.

51:00.457 --> 51:02.559
What was really cool for me was
seeing Gia

51:02.559 --> 51:04.495
in a completely different
silhouette.

51:04.495 --> 51:06.730
Like with the breastplate
and with the hip pads,

51:06.730 --> 51:08.032
we've never seen that from her.

51:08.032 --> 51:09.733
I thought she pulled it off
really well.

51:09.733 --> 51:10.567
- Yeah.

51:10.567 --> 51:14.538
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] This
keeps getting harder and harder.

51:14.538 --> 51:16.974
But I think we've made our
decision.

51:16.974 --> 51:19.109
Bring back our queens.

51:20.277 --> 51:22.179
Welcome back, queens.

51:22.179 --> 51:23.747
We have made some decisions.

51:26.283 --> 51:27.785
Gia Metric,

51:27.785 --> 51:30.788
this week, you gave us an
electric shock

51:30.788 --> 51:32.423
and left us buzzing.

51:34.625 --> 51:35.459
You are safe.

51:36.360 --> 51:38.262
You may move to the back of the
stage.

51:38.262 --> 51:40.064
And great job this week.

51:40.064 --> 51:41.065
- Thank you so much.

51:46.537 --> 51:47.771
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Pythia.

51:47.771 --> 51:50.240
This week, you took us to the
dark side

51:51.108 --> 51:52.710
and we saw the light.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.380
Con-drag-ulations.

51:58.015 --> 52:01.485
You are the winner of this
week's maxi challenge.

52:01.485 --> 52:05.289
- [Pythia] I won a makeover
slash design challenge.

52:05.289 --> 52:07.324
Now I can leave Icesis the fuck
alone.

52:08.425 --> 52:12.296
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] You have
won a $2.500 beauty gift card

52:12.296 --> 52:14.631
from our friends at Shoppers
Drug Mart.

52:14.631 --> 52:15.599
- Thank you.

52:15.599 --> 52:16.567
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] As well,

52:16.567 --> 52:20.037
Shoppers Drug Mart will be
making a $5.000 donation

52:20.037 --> 52:21.872
to It Gets Better Canada.

52:21.872 --> 52:22.906
- Yay!

52:22.906 --> 52:23.741
(clapping)

52:23.741 --> 52:25.743
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] It
Gets Better Canada's mission

52:25.743 --> 52:30.214
is to uplift, empower and
connect 2SLGBTQ+

52:30.214 --> 52:32.316
youth across Canada.

52:32.316 --> 52:33.951
- That's amazing, thank you.
Thank you.

52:33.951 --> 52:37.187
What I just got to do
is so important to me.

52:37.187 --> 52:40.357
In their age, I really hated
myself

52:40.357 --> 52:43.594
and I was praying to
God every day to fix me

52:43.594 --> 52:45.462
or to take me out of this life.

52:45.462 --> 52:47.965
So winning this and being able
to showcase

52:47.965 --> 52:49.900
through these kids that it does
get better

52:49.900 --> 52:51.235
and we're fucking fabulous.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.003
- Yeah.

52:53.003 --> 52:55.739
- [Pythia] And I'm so
thankful for this win.

52:55.739 --> 52:56.974
I'm so sorry.

52:56.974 --> 52:57.941
I'm pulling a Gia.

52:59.343 --> 53:01.178
Oscar speeches up in here.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.212
- Shade.

53:02.212 --> 53:03.747
- You may move to the back of
the stage.

53:03.747 --> 53:04.815
- Thank you so much.

53:04.815 --> 53:07.584
(clapping)

53:07.584 --> 53:08.952
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Adrianna.

53:08.952 --> 53:11.188
You're a queen who can dress,

53:11.188 --> 53:14.992
but your execution this
week was a bit of a mess.

53:16.994 --> 53:18.429
I'm sorry, my dear,

53:18.429 --> 53:19.997
but you are up for elimination.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.368
Kendall Gender.

53:24.368 --> 53:26.837
This week, you lost some
thunder,

53:26.837 --> 53:28.238
but you weathered the storm.

53:30.174 --> 53:31.008
You are safe.

53:36.847 --> 53:38.082
Icesis Couture,

53:38.082 --> 53:39.283
I'm sorry, my dear,

53:39.283 --> 53:41.385
but this means you are up for
elimination.

53:46.256 --> 53:48.525
- [Traci Melchor] Two
queens stand before us.

53:49.827 --> 53:50.928
Prior to tonight,

53:50.928 --> 53:53.363
you were asked to prepare
a lip-sync performance

53:53.363 --> 53:58.235
of Mitsou's Everybody Say
Love written by RuPaul.

53:58.235 --> 54:01.538
This is your last chance
to impress the judges

54:01.538 --> 54:04.108
and save yourself from
elimination.

54:06.343 --> 54:10.814
The time has come for you to lip
sync

54:11.815 --> 54:13.817
for your life.

54:16.153 --> 54:19.523
- [Adriana] This is the
battle of Latin America, baby.

54:19.523 --> 54:22.526
- [Icesis Couture] I am not
going down without a fight.

54:22.526 --> 54:23.961
- [Traci Melchor] Good luck.

54:23.961 --> 54:25.896
And don't fuck it up.

54:27.531 --> 54:30.033
(song begins)

56:47.437 --> 56:49.539
(cheering)

56:49.539 --> 56:50.540
- Holy shit!

56:53.143 --> 56:55.279
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes]
That was so much fun.

57:00.350 --> 57:03.186
- [Traci Melchor] We've made our
decision.

57:07.824 --> 57:08.692
Icesis Couture,

57:10.093 --> 57:10.994
shantay, you stay.

57:13.096 --> 57:14.364
- [Mikayla] Oh, thank God.

57:15.599 --> 57:16.767
- [Traci Melchor] You make
your way to the others.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.635
- Thank you so much.

57:18.635 --> 57:20.671
- Oh, I love you, I love you, I
love you.

57:24.374 --> 57:25.509
- [Traci Melchor] Adriana,

57:25.509 --> 57:27.778
you are a magical queen

57:27.778 --> 57:30.647
and we will always be under your
spell.

57:30.647 --> 57:32.916
Now, sashay away.

57:32.916 --> 57:36.019
- Thank you from the bottom of
my heart,

57:36.019 --> 57:37.788
I am very proud of what I showed

57:37.788 --> 57:41.191
and it's just a see you later,
so.

57:41.191 --> 57:42.693
- Do you need a lift?

57:42.693 --> 57:43.527
- Please, yes.

57:44.561 --> 57:45.896
- We love you so much.

57:48.265 --> 57:49.666
- I love you.

57:49.666 --> 57:52.002
Kisses and hugs to everyone.

57:52.002 --> 57:54.671
Now I'm going to have some fun
by myself.

57:54.671 --> 57:56.907
(laughing)

57:58.241 --> 58:02.579
Finally, I don't have to
force myself to speak English.

58:04.247 --> 58:06.750
I cannot believe that I did
this.

58:06.750 --> 58:10.854
I was that little kid in
Columbia and never thought that

58:10.854 --> 58:13.290
I was gonna be here, living my
dream.

58:14.391 --> 58:17.928
I do still have a lot
to show to the world,

58:17.928 --> 58:20.964
but this is just the beginning
and you better be ready.

58:23.800 --> 58:24.968
- [Traci Melchor]
Con-drag-ulations,

58:24.968 --> 58:27.637
you live to slay another day

58:27.637 --> 58:31.608
and remember, stay true
North, strong, and fierce.

58:31.608 --> 58:33.810
Now let the music play.

58:33.810 --> 58:36.380
(bright music)

58:54.231 --> 58:56.600
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] Next
time on Canada's Drag Race.

58:56.600 --> 58:57.434
(siren blaring)

58:57.434 --> 58:58.268
- Wait, what?

58:58.268 --> 58:59.169
- Not the voomail.

58:59.169 --> 59:01.204
- [RuPaul] No queen will be
crowned,

59:01.204 --> 59:03.273
until you're reunited.

59:04.741 --> 59:06.276
- A reunion?

59:06.276 --> 59:08.145
- I'm not doing this.

59:08.145 --> 59:09.246
- [Crowd] Hi.

59:10.580 --> 59:13.016
- [Brooke Lynn Hytes] You
had some tense moments.
