Hey, sweetheart, why are you
hanging out with Victor Stein?

40:54.496 --> 40:56.832
‐ Oh. We're just friends.
‐ Uh‐huh.

40:56.832 --> 41:00.002
‐ I mean, the aliens used our bodies
for a physical release,

41:00.002 --> 41:01.545
but the sex meant nothing.

41:01.545 --> 41:02.546
‐ What?

41:02.546 --> 41:05.799
‐ Also, I am super sorry
for trying to kill you.

41:05.799 --> 41:08.218
DALE: Okay, the killing part
I can understand, I guess,

41:08.218 --> 41:11.597
because you were...
but... you getting giggy with Victor?

41:11.597 --> 41:15.017
I'm thinking we're back
in couples therapy twice a week.

41:15.851 --> 41:17.019
‐ Maybe three times.

‐ Karolina. You know what to do.

41:18.854 --> 41:20.689
‐ Yeah. Light up.

41:23.692 --> 41:25.027
[sighs] I can't.

41:25.027 --> 41:27.279
‐ Just like the Dark Dimension?

41:27.279 --> 41:29.907
‐ Morgan must have some kind of spell.
Powers don't work.

41:30.908 --> 41:32.951
‐ I hate to say it,
but I wish Nico were here.

41:52.429 --> 41:57.351
‐ Permit my entry into night,
and allow the darkness find its light.

41:58.852 --> 42:01.021
[snarling noises]

42:19.206 --> 42:21.750
‐ Who are you?
‐ And what the hell have you done?
