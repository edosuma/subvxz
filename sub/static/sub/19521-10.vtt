two woman hitting the buzzer,

01:57.751 --> 02:00.252

as these athletes
fight for a spot

02:01.989 --> 02:04.156
in the national finals

02:04.158 --> 02:07.793
- And here's who I expect
to rock Cleveland tonight.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.829
<i>First, there's the Weatherman,
Joe Moravsky.</i>

02:10.830 --> 02:14.633
<i>The Connecticut meteorologist
was the fastest in qualifying.</i>

02:14.635 --> 02:16.768
- Whoo!

02:16.770 --> 02:19.671
<i>- Then there's the phenom
from Philadelphia,</i>

<i>Najee Richardson.</i>

02:21.976 --> 02:23.876
<i>- Destroys this course.</i>

02:28.315 --> 02:31.450
<i>- First buzzer for a woman
this season.</i>

02:31.452 --> 02:33.185
<i>- And the other woman
who hit a buzzer</i>

02:33.187 --> 02:35.621
<i>in qualifying,
former track star</i>

02:35.623 --> 02:37.789
<i>Jesse "Flex" Labreck.</i>

02:37.791 --> 02:40.192

02:40.194 --> 02:41.760

four more obstacles

02:41.762 --> 02:43.295

02:43.297 --> 02:44.763
For our first look
at the course,

02:44.765 --> 02:46.598
let's go down
to Kristine Leahy.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.367
- Thanks, guys.
- This course tonight features

02:48.369 --> 02:52.037
ten difficult obstacles
and a few surprises.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.006
<i>The first six are the ones
these athletes</i>

02:54.008 --> 02:55.440
<i>saw in qualifying,</i>

02:55.442 --> 02:57.376
<i>including the wild Rolling Log</i>

02:57.378 --> 03:00.279
<i>and the challenging I-Beam
Gap.</i>

03:00.281 --> 03:01.747
<i>Then it's on
to the four obstacles</i>

03:01.749 --> 03:03.982
<i>added for the finals,
starting with the iconic</i>

03:03.984 --> 03:05.384
<i>Salmon Ladder,</i>

03:05.386 --> 03:08.187
followed by a new obstacle,
the Nail Clipper.

03:08.189 --> 03:11.123
<i>They'll have to work their way
across four rolling cylinders</i>

03:11.125 --> 03:13.225
<i>using only their fingertips.</i>

03:13.227 --> 03:15.861
<i>Right behind it is another
upper-body obstacle,</i>

03:15.863 --> 03:18.830
<i>the Clacker, which debuted
last year in Atlanta.</i>

03:18.832 --> 03:21.133
<i>The final obstacle
is the Elevator Climb,</i>

03:21.135 --> 03:23.035
<i>which has been
so tough this year.</i>

03:23.037 --> 03:25.204
<i>Competitors have to use
their upper body</i>

03:25.206 --> 03:28.774
<i>to pump those handles up
the 35-foot chute to the top.</i>

03:28.776 --> 03:30.609
<i>If they can survive
and hit the buzzer,</i>

03:30.611 --> 03:33.478
they've guaranteed themselves
a spot in Las Vegas.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.214
Guys, back to you.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.216

<i>And we're gonna kick
things off</i>

03:46.060 --> 03:49.394
<i>with our unofficial host here
in the Buckeye State.</i>

03:49.396 --> 03:51.863
<i>This is Worthington,
Ohio's Michelle Warnky.</i>

03:51.865 --> 03:54.833
- O-H!
all: I-O!

03:54.835 --> 03:57.803
<i>- Okay, I see you,
spelling out the O-H-I-O.</i>

03:57.805 --> 04:00.472
<i>- Warnky's always been a
leader in the ninja community.</i>

04:00.474 --> 04:03.242
<i>She was the first woman
to open a ninja gym,</i>

04:03.244 --> 04:06.745
<i>was the elder stateswoman for
the Fantastic Four last year,</i>

04:06.747 --> 04:09.414
<i>and now she's a trendsetter
with her online workouts.</i>

04:11.452 --> 04:12.751
<i>- Hey, everyone.
- Michelle Warnky here</i>

04:12.753 --> 04:14.119
<i>with your Warnky

04:14.121 --> 04:15.687
<i>and today I have
a fun challenge</i>

04:15.689 --> 04:18.089
<i>that will get you ready
to crush that course.</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:19.690
I got to talking
with Jessie Graff.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.560
<i>She was telling me
she thought I would be great</i>

04:21.562 --> 04:24.029
<i>at doing instructional
fitness videos.</i>

04:24.031 --> 04:25.731
<i>- And they're off.</i>

04:25.733 --> 04:27.199
<i>- I began thinking
about it more</i>

04:27.201 --> 04:29.134
<i>and realized
that I love challenges.</i>

04:29.136 --> 04:31.336
<i>Are you guys ready?
So I started recording them</i>

04:31.338 --> 04:32.771
<i>and called them
Warnky challenge Wednesdays.</i>

04:32.773 --> 04:34.072
<i>This is Michelle Warnky</i>

04:34.074 --> 04:35.407
<i>for your Warnky
challenge Wednesday.</i>

<i>Your Warnky challenge
Wednesday.</i>

04:36.744 --> 04:38.243
<i>Your Warnky
challenge Wednesday.</i>

04:38.245 --> 04:40.145
<i>Now I've gotten people
contacting me,</i>

04:40.147 --> 04:42.547
<i>saying they look forward
to it every Wednesday.</i>

04:42.549 --> 04:44.516
<i>Today's challenge is to hold
a one-arm lock off</i>

04:44.518 --> 04:45.951
<i>as long as you can.</i>

04:45.953 --> 04:47.953
<i>There's a lot of ninjas
that do the challenges.</i>

04:47.955 --> 04:49.454
<i>- Go.</i>

04:49.456 --> 04:51.056
<i>- It's been awesome to see
just the community</i>

04:51.058 --> 04:53.191
<i>of ninjas come together.</i>

04:53.193 --> 04:54.626
<i>- Nice.</i>

04:54.628 --> 04:56.228
<i>- We all can
challenge each other</i>

04:56.230 --> 04:58.430
<i>and help each other get
better.</i>

04:58.432 --> 05:00.365
<i>[laughs]</i>

05:00.367 --> 05:02.734
<i>Tonight's Warnky challenge
is to hit that buzzer</i>

05:02.736 --> 05:05.270
<i>and go to Vegas.</i>

05:05.272 --> 05:08.407
<i>- Here in her home state,
Warnky's got a huge crowd,</i>

05:08.409 --> 05:11.043
<i>along with many of her
fellow competitors</i>

05:11.045 --> 05:12.778
<i>and of course her family,</i>

05:12.780 --> 05:16.248
<i>including her dad Chris, who
ran the course in qualifying.</i>

05:16.250 --> 05:17.716
[countdown clock beeping]

05:17.718 --> 05:19.685
<i>And remember,
there are no more wild cards</i>

05:19.687 --> 05:21.019
<i>to the national finals.</i>

05:21.021 --> 05:22.754
<i>You have to earn it.</i>

05:22.756 --> 05:26.325
<i>You must be among the top 15
overall or the top two women,</i>

05:26.327 --> 05:28.126
<i>and it's a loaded field
in Cleveland,</i>

05:28.128 --> 05:30.629
<i>so Warnky's gonna need
a good run to advance.</i>

05:30.631 --> 05:33.231
<i>She's quickly through
the Floating Steps.</i>

05:33.233 --> 05:36.501
<i>Waiting for her, the always
dangerous Rolling Log.</i>

05:36.503 --> 05:38.603
<i>You have to hold on
with arms and legs</i>

05:38.605 --> 05:41.540
<i>to survive this 23-foot ride
down the track.</i>

05:41.542 --> 05:44.476
<i>- Look at the back muscles.
- Everything's engaged, defined.</i>

05:44.478 --> 05:48.513
<i>- And good flexibility,
getting those legs locked.</i>

05:48.515 --> 05:51.717
<i>A lot of spins,
but she survives.</i>

05:51.719 --> 05:53.752
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.520
<i>- She moves on now
to the Razor's Edge,</i>

05:55.522 --> 05:57.823
<i>and you can see,
she is shaken up.</i>

05:57.825 --> 05:59.257
<i>Wow.</i>

05:59.259 --> 06:02.227
- Find your center,
find your center.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.162
<i>- Now facing a balance
obstacle.</i>

06:04.164 --> 06:06.932
<i>You have to run across the
tops of those three blades.</i>

06:06.934 --> 06:08.834
<i>- I want to see her get it,
I want to see her get it.</i>

06:08.836 --> 06:10.469
<i>- Oh, no. Clever, clever.</i>

06:10.471 --> 06:12.137
<i>- I love the adjustment
she made</i>

06:12.139 --> 06:13.905
<i>in midair on Razor's Edge.</i>

06:13.907 --> 06:15.440
- Whoo!

06:15.442 --> 06:17.409
<i>- But now it's the obstacle
that took her out</i>

06:17.411 --> 06:19.811
<i>in qualifying, the Ring Jump.</i>

06:19.813 --> 06:22.347
<i>Has to jump the ring up
and over the pegs.</i>

06:22.349 --> 06:24.516
<i>- I like this; she's going
with the backwards approach.</i>

06:24.518 --> 06:27.352
<i>- She told Kristine
after falling in qualifying</i>

06:27.354 --> 06:29.187
<i>that she should've
tried this technique.</i>

06:29.189 --> 06:32.057
<i>- Two moves, two moves.
- And look at that,</i>

06:32.059 --> 06:34.826
<i>using the momentum, making
that transition so easy.</i>

06:34.828 --> 06:36.628
<i>- The angle is what's
so tricky here.</i>

06:36.630 --> 06:39.398
<i>This is a 30-degree angle
going down.</i>

06:39.400 --> 06:42.901
<i>- But this is the spot
where she fell in qualifying.</i>

06:42.903 --> 06:45.804
<i>Moving through it
a lot more quickly tonight</i>

06:45.806 --> 06:48.473
<i>and now just needs
the dismount,</i>

06:48.475 --> 06:50.275
<i>and she's got it.</i>

06:50.277 --> 06:54.212
<i>It got her in qualifying,
but not tonight.</i>

06:54.214 --> 06:56.681
[crowd chanting]

06:56.683 --> 06:58.083
<i>And the crowd
chanting her name.</i>

06:58.085 --> 07:01.787
- Yes!
- You got it, Michelle.

07:01.789 --> 07:05.490
<i>- Now the I-Beam Gap.
- Has to go upside down</i>

07:05.492 --> 07:08.093
<i>and work her way across
those small ledges</i>

07:08.095 --> 07:10.228
<i>and then jump
across the middle.</i>

07:10.230 --> 07:12.664
<i>Watch those fingertips here
and watch that lower body.</i>

07:12.666 --> 07:14.099
<i>Look at that, locking in.</i>

07:14.101 --> 07:15.834
<i>- And look at the pace
that she's doing.</i>

07:15.836 --> 07:17.903
<i>- Whoa. Come on.</i>

07:17.905 --> 07:21.039
<i>- Look at her. Look at that,
wasting no time.</i>

07:21.041 --> 07:22.374
<i>- And stands right up.</i>

07:22.376 --> 07:25.911
- Whoo!
- All right.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.446
<i>- But now has to make
the backwards</i>

07:27.448 --> 07:33.084
<i>leap to the other side,
6 1/2 feet, 180 in midair.</i>

07:33.086 --> 07:36.154
<i>- It's a big deal, big deal
- Got it.</i>

07:36.156 --> 07:38.490
<i>- Matt, she wants that
Warped Wall again.</i>

07:38.492 --> 07:42.494
<i>It's been a few years. This
will mean a lot to get back.</i>

07:42.496 --> 07:46.331
<i>- Needs the dismount.</i>

07:46.333 --> 07:48.066
And she's done it.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.937
Michelle Warnky is back
to face the Warped Wall.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.305
Well, it was just three years
ago

07:53.307 --> 07:55.574
when Warnky became
only the second woman

07:55.576 --> 07:57.142
to conquer the Warped Wall.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.845
She did it a week
after mighty Kacy Catanzaro

07:59.847 --> 08:02.614
but she hasn't made it back
since season six,

08:02.616 --> 08:05.083
and the wall is now
6 inches taller.

08:05.085 --> 08:08.220
[together]
Beat that wall, beat that wall.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.822
- You can feel the energy.
- She wants it bad, Matt.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.758
All the way up, all the way up.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.093
- Yes!

08:15.095 --> 08:17.496
- That's her, that's her.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.564
[cheers and applause]

08:19.566 --> 08:22.367

of the course,</i>

08:25.205 --> 08:28.306
<i>but this is where it
really gets challenging.</i>

08:28.308 --> 08:32.077
<i>Look at all the hometown
support Warnky's getting.</i>

08:32.078 --> 08:33.477
<i>Well, the last time
she made it up</i>

08:33.480 --> 08:35.046
<i>the Warped Wall, in St. Louis,</i>

08:35.048 --> 08:37.549
<i>she went out on this obstacle,
the Salmon Ladder.</i>

08:37.551 --> 08:40.818
<i>Just didn't get a good
jump off the trampoline.</i>

08:40.821 --> 08:43.321
- This is all you, Michelle.
- You got it.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.623
<i>- She has trained trampolines</i>

08:44.625 --> 08:47.158
<i>relentlessly for
this moment right here.</i>

08:47.160 --> 08:49.594
<i>- Don't think about it.
- Just go for it, Michelle.</i>

08:49.596 --> 08:52.197
<i>Go for it.</i>

08:52.199 --> 08:55.934
<i>- Nice.
- Got it. That was close.</i>

08:55.936 --> 08:58.737
<i>She's smiling,
and her dad's smiling too.</i>

08:58.739 --> 09:03.208
<i>He knows how much
this means to her.</i>

09:03.210 --> 09:05.443
<i>And look at the smile
on her face, Akbar.</i>

09:05.445 --> 09:09.948
<i>- Whoo! You own a gym, and you
just owned the Salmon Ladder.</i>

09:09.950 --> 09:13.852
<i>- This is the farthest she's
ever made it, as she moves on</i>

09:13.854 --> 09:16.321
<i>to this new obstacle,
the Nail Clipper.</i>

09:16.323 --> 09:18.423
<i>You can only use
your upper body</i>

09:18.425 --> 09:20.926
<i>to get across these
four rotating cylinders.</i>

09:20.928 --> 09:23.028
<i>- Let me tell you, this is
gonna be tough for her.</i>

09:23.030 --> 09:24.563
<i>She's only 5'4",
so this would be</i>

09:24.565 --> 09:28.033
<i>a big reach
to that second cylinder.</i>

09:28.035 --> 09:30.602
<i>See where you're going.
Ooh.</i>

09:30.604 --> 09:32.771
<i>- Oh!
- Man.</i>

09:32.773 --> 09:35.340
- Good run!

09:35.342 --> 09:37.676
<i>- What a run
by Michelle Warnky,</i>

09:37.678 --> 09:40.211
<i>gets to the eighth obstacle.</i>

09:40.213 --> 09:42.247
<i>- The crowd is on their feet.
- They get it.</i>

09:42.249 --> 09:45.083
<i>They understand
what she just did.</i>

09:45.085 --> 09:48.486
<i>She waited three years to
get back up the Warped Wall,</i>

09:48.488 --> 09:51.089
<i>and she did it
in her home state of Ohio.</i>

09:51.091 --> 09:52.624
<i>But on the Nail Clipper,</i>

09:52.626 --> 09:55.527
<i>she had the tongue
wagging like Michael Jordan,</i>

09:55.529 --> 09:58.029
<i>but she couldn't reach
across that gap.</i>

09:58.031 --> 10:00.899
<i>But the best run ever
for Michelle Warnky.</i>

10:00.901 --> 10:02.200
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine</i>

10:02.202 --> 10:04.002
<i>for the POM Post Run
Interview.</i>

10:04.004 --> 10:05.804
- Michelle, congratulations.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.772
You look so happy,
as you should be.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.407
I want to go back, though,
to the Ring Jump

10:09.409 --> 10:10.508
that took you out
in qualifying.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.010
How did you get
past it tonight?

10:12.012 --> 10:13.211
- Yeah, in city qualifiers,

10:13.213 --> 10:14.512
I saw a lot of people
going backwards,

10:14.514 --> 10:16.281
and they looked good,
but I wasn't sure.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.783
I'd never tried it before,
so this time I was like,

10:18.785 --> 10:19.985
<i>"I got to go for it."</i>

10:19.987 --> 10:21.920
<i>So it was good.
It worked well.</i>

10:21.922 --> 10:25.056
- You also got some redemption
on the Salmon Ladder.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.093
We all remember that moment.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.862
What was that like for you?

10:30.864 --> 10:32.897
- Yes.
- I knew I'd trained it,

10:32.899 --> 10:34.566
<i>so I was like, "Michelle,
you know you can do this.</i>

10:34.568 --> 10:35.834
<i>You just got to do it."</i>

10:35.836 --> 10:38.470
<i>It felt amazing
to finally do it.</i>

10:38.472 --> 10:39.638
- We'll see if you made it
far enough fast enough

10:39.640 --> 10:40.672
to go to Las Vegas.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.507
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.975
- Guys, back to you.

10:46.647 --> 10:50.782
<i>- Tonight, the rock stars of
"Ninja" take over Cleveland.</i>

10:50.784 --> 10:53.752
<i>We'll see the Weatherman,
Joe Moravsky.</i>

10:53.754 --> 10:55.253
<i>Putting on a show here.</i>

10:55.255 --> 10:57.589
<i>The Phoenix, Najee Richardson.</i>

10:57.591 --> 10:59.424
<i>- That was crazy.</i>

10:59.426 --> 11:02.193
<i>- And Captain NBC, Jamie Rahn.</i>

11:02.195 --> 11:03.928
<i>It ain't a bird.
It ain't a plane.</i>

11:03.930 --> 11:06.231
<i>It's Jamie Rahn.</i>

11:06.233 --> 11:08.833
<i>Plus, we're going back
to school...</i>

11:08.835 --> 11:10.435
all: Go, Ms. Beird!

11:10.437 --> 11:12.937
<i>- With the fifth grade teacher
who can tear it up</i>

11:12.939 --> 11:14.472
<i>on the course.</i>

11:14.474 --> 11:17.308
<i>- ♪ Let me show you

11:17.310 --> 11:19.244
<i>♪ Shake it out ♪</i>

11:19.246 --> 11:21.446
[cheers and applause]

11:21.448 --> 11:23.148

11:23.150 --> 11:25.784
<i>- And later, whether he's

<i>- Or jumping out of planes,</i>

11:29.022 --> 11:31.923
<i>Jon Alexis Jr.

11:31.925 --> 11:35.527
<i>- ♪ Let me show you what

11:35.529 --> 11:39.464
<i>- It's all coming up on
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

11:43.569 --> 11:46.337
<i>- Welcome back to "American
Ninja Warrior" in Cleveland.</i>

11:46.339 --> 11:47.906
.
<i>While we were away,</i>

11:47.908 --> 11:51.443
<i>three more athletes took on
this city finals course.</i>

11:51.445 --> 11:53.478
<i>Pittsburgh school teacher
Mike Shuck</i>

11:53.480 --> 11:56.448
<i>was making his first
appearance in the city finals.</i>

11:56.450 --> 11:57.982
<i>And he's through,
but he didn't</i>

11:57.984 --> 12:00.018
<i>get to enjoy it for long,</i>

12:00.020 --> 12:02.987
<i>as he spun out
on the Rolling Log.</i>

12:02.989 --> 12:05.390
<i>- Oh, no.
- And there it is.</i>

12:05.392 --> 12:06.891
<i>- Rejected.</i>

12:06.893 --> 12:08.827
<i>- Rhode Island's
Fabio Figueiredo</i>

12:08.829 --> 12:11.229
<i>had some smooth moves
on the course.</i>

12:11.231 --> 12:13.732
<i>- I love the dance moves
he's pulling out here.</i>

12:13.734 --> 12:15.400
<i>- But seconds later,</i>

12:15.402 --> 12:18.636
<i>the barber was turned upside
down at the Razor's Edge.</i>

12:18.638 --> 12:23.875
<i>Oh, wow. And the Barber Ninja
snipped out there.</i>

12:23.877 --> 12:27.579
<i>Ohio mailman Cory Cook
came out ready to deliver.</i>

12:27.581 --> 12:29.114
<i>- I see you, Cory Cook.</i>

12:29.116 --> 12:31.549
<i>- And after taking off
the uniform,</i>

12:31.551 --> 12:33.618
<i>Cook made the leap
on the I-beam,</i>

12:33.620 --> 12:35.754
<i>but then his grip gave out.</i>

12:35.756 --> 12:39.657
<i>- Oh! Wow.</i>

12:39.659 --> 12:42.494
<i>- Our next athlete
is truly impressive.</i>

12:42.496 --> 12:44.362
<i>Coming up in
his surgical scrubs,</i>

12:44.364 --> 12:46.831
<i>it's Boston's Alexi Matousek.</i>

12:46.833 --> 12:48.967
<i>He's a surgeon for
the Harvard Medical School,</i>

12:48.969 --> 12:51.936
<i>and he also runs a program
that brings medical care</i>

12:51.938 --> 12:54.806
<i>to the people of Haiti.</i>

12:54.808 --> 12:56.508
<i>- I'm a surgeon at the Brigham
and Women's Hospital,</i>

12:56.510 --> 12:58.643
<i>in Boston, but the
work that I do in Haiti</i>

12:58.645 --> 13:00.879
<i>is absolutely what makes me
feel most alive.</i>

13:02.315 --> 13:05.383
<i>I work in a small mountain
village high up in the hills</i>

13:05.385 --> 13:09.687
that is very far from
any sort of civilization.

13:09.689 --> 13:13.825
<i>The people there are really
cast off and forgotten.</i>

13:13.827 --> 13:15.593
<i>They can't read or write</i>

13:15.595 --> 13:17.762
<i>and have a hard time
getting down to the hospital,</i>

13:17.764 --> 13:20.098
<i>so we started a program
to take them by the hand</i>

13:20.100 --> 13:21.900
<i>and go to the hospital
with them.</i>

13:21.902 --> 13:26.070
<i>We've treated diabetes. We've
treated fractures and tumors.</i>

13:29.943 --> 13:33.278
<i>We've had 240 families
in the last two years</i>

13:33.280 --> 13:34.612
<i>have access to surgical care</i>

13:34.614 --> 13:36.781
<i>that they never
would've gotten.</i>

13:38.251 --> 13:42.353
<i>Being able to use my skills in
Haiti means everything to me.</i>

13:42.355 --> 13:45.623
I know what my purpose is,
and that's what I have,

13:45.625 --> 13:48.827
and they have given it to me,
and I'm forever grateful.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.065
<i>- There are the doctor's wife
and two kids.</i>

13:54.067 --> 13:56.734
<i>They're wearing scrubs
just like dad.</i>

13:56.736 --> 13:58.937
[countdown clock beeping]

13:58.939 --> 14:01.206
<i>Between the charity work,
the hospital work,</i>

14:01.208 --> 14:04.175
<i>and his family, it's amazing
this guy has time to train.</i>

14:04.177 --> 14:06.477
<i>- Well, he got all the way
to the fifth obstacle</i>

14:06.479 --> 14:09.280
<i>until he met his match
with I-Beam Gap,</i>

14:09.282 --> 14:11.883
<i>but he showed in qualifying
that he is no scrub,</i>

14:11.885 --> 14:14.953
<i>even though he was
competing in scrubs.</i>

14:14.955 --> 14:17.655
<i>- Now the wild ride
that is the Rolling Log.</i>

14:17.657 --> 14:18.990
<i>- Look, this is a surgeon
right here,</i>

14:18.992 --> 14:21.326
<i>so you know
he's got good hands.</i>

14:24.431 --> 14:26.264
<i>Good placement.
Oh.</i>

14:26.266 --> 14:27.532
<i>- Thrown off.
- Yeah.</i>

14:30.170 --> 14:31.703
<i>- Well, this guy's
a cardiothoracic surgeon;</i>

14:31.705 --> 14:34.706
<i>he operates
on hearts and lungs,</i>

14:34.708 --> 14:36.808
<i>where one mistake
can mean life or death.</i>

14:36.810 --> 14:40.345
<i>This guy knows pressure,
now facing the Razor's Edge.</i>

14:42.382 --> 14:44.782
<i>No problem. Cuts right
through it.</i>

14:44.784 --> 14:46.818
<i>Rolling right into
the Ring Jump.</i>

14:46.820 --> 14:48.486
<i>- This doctor getting surgical
with it.</i>

14:48.488 --> 14:50.088
<i>He's in a hurry.</i>

14:50.090 --> 14:52.891
<i>- Wow,
skipped three pegs there.</i>

14:52.893 --> 14:56.127
<i>- Just because he's a doctor
doesn't mean he ain't strong.</i>

14:56.129 --> 14:58.429
<i>- Well, the doctor
is operating tonight.</i>

15:01.601 --> 15:03.835
<i>Tremendous power here
out of Matousek,</i>

15:03.837 --> 15:05.870
<i>good control,
great efficiency.</i>

15:05.872 --> 15:08.172
<i>I like it. This is
a good pace, Akbar.</i>

15:08.174 --> 15:12.677
<i>- Somebody spent a lot of time
in the gym during med school.</i>

15:12.679 --> 15:15.546
<i>- Now stepping up to take on
the I-Beam Gap.</i>

15:15.548 --> 15:18.316
<i>This is the obstacle that
took him out in qualifying.</i>

15:18.318 --> 15:19.984
<i>He was able to make
the transition</i>

15:19.986 --> 15:23.087
<i>but just lost his grip
near the end.</i>

15:23.089 --> 15:25.123
- I can't watch.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.293
<i>- 5'10" and 165 pounds.</i>

15:28.295 --> 15:30.461
<i>He said he's been working
on his grip strength.</i>

15:30.463 --> 15:32.096
<i>- The doc is an athlete.</i>

15:32.098 --> 15:33.164
<i>He played college basketball
at Rhodes College.</i>

15:33.166 --> 15:34.866
<i>Go Lynx.</i>

15:34.868 --> 15:37.802
<i>- But struggling a bit here
to get past these gaps.</i>

15:37.804 --> 15:39.904
<i>You can see that
2-foot space there.</i>

15:39.906 --> 15:42.206
<i>Trying to move
his legs around it.</i>

15:42.208 --> 15:45.677
<i>- All right, here we go again.
- There's this pull up here.</i>

15:45.679 --> 15:47.211
<i>That pull up,
you got to go for it.</i>

15:47.213 --> 15:49.314
<i>- Good power.
- Nice, nice.</i>

15:49.316 --> 15:51.582
<i>Come on, doc.</i>

15:51.584 --> 15:53.918
<i>- Oh, he's really working.
- All right, here we go.</i>

15:53.920 --> 15:56.120
<i>Come on, Matousek. All right.</i>

15:56.122 --> 15:57.121
<i>- He's up.</i>

15:57.123 --> 16:00.091
[cheers and applause]

16:00.093 --> 16:01.693
<i>This transition, 6 1/2 feet,</i>

16:01.695 --> 16:05.530
<i>got to flip 180 degrees
in midair.</i>

16:05.532 --> 16:08.366
<i>- Yes.
- But he's not home free.</i>

16:08.368 --> 16:10.368
<i>This is where he fell
in qualifying,</i>

16:10.370 --> 16:12.570
<i>after he made the leap
to the other side.</i>

16:12.572 --> 16:15.573
<i>Still only a 2-inch ledge.</i>

16:15.575 --> 16:17.942
<i>- You know, Matt, I think
he's got it this time.</i>

16:17.944 --> 16:20.044
<i>Just needs the dismount.</i>

16:20.046 --> 16:21.879
<i>- Oh!</i>

16:21.881 --> 16:27.218
- Dang gum!
- Deja vu.

16:27.220 --> 16:31.589
<i>The doctor flatlines once
again on the I-Beam Gap,</i>

16:31.591 --> 16:34.025
<i>just inches away
from the finish.</i>

16:34.027 --> 16:36.060
<i>- He was so close.</i>

16:36.062 --> 16:38.496
<i>He's almost right above
the landing pad.</i>

16:38.498 --> 16:42.233
<i>But watch his fingers.
They just slide right off.</i>

16:42.235 --> 16:44.836
- That was so much fun,
so thankful.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.305
Thank you, guys.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.241
<i>- Coming up, he's Captain NBC,</i>

16:50.243 --> 16:52.877
<i>the ninja world's
favorite superhero.</i>

16:52.879 --> 16:55.213
- I am faster than
a speeding bullet.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.683
<i>- But there's a big change
in Jamie Rahn's future.</i>

16:58.685 --> 17:01.619
<i>And later, she made big moves
on the course</i>

17:01.621 --> 17:03.554
<i>as a history-making rookie.</i>

17:03.556 --> 17:05.223
<i>Yes!</i>

17:05.224 --> 17:06.624
<i>Now Jesse Labreck</i>

17:06.626 --> 17:09.926
<i>is making another
big move off the course.</i>

17:09.929 --> 17:11.529
- I think it's gonna
be really fun.

17:11.531 --> 17:15.199
<i>- That's coming up on
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

17:19.938 --> 17:21.806
<i>- Welcome back to "American
Ninja Warrior" in Cleveland.</i>

17:21.808 --> 17:23.407
.
<i>While we were away,</i>

17:23.410 --> 17:26.511
<i>three more finalists
got their shot at the course.</i>

17:26.512 --> 17:28.579
<i>Nursing student
Annika Nieshalla</i>

17:28.581 --> 17:30.548
<i>looked like she needed CPR</i>

17:30.550 --> 17:33.184
<i>after a wild ride
on the Rolling Log.</i>

17:33.186 --> 17:36.754
<i>- And she collapses.
- It shakes everyone up.</i>

17:36.756 --> 17:39.991
<i>And that seemed to affect her
balance on the next obstacle.</i>

17:39.993 --> 17:41.392
<i>Oh!</i>

17:41.394 --> 17:45.096
<i>Nieshalla cut down
by the Razor's Edge.</i>

17:45.098 --> 17:48.399
<i>Boston police officer
Steve Allen was resourceful</i>

17:48.401 --> 17:51.035
<i>and used his feet
to get through the Ring Jump.</i>

17:51.037 --> 17:52.336
<i>- See, that's the type
of police officer</i>

17:52.338 --> 17:53.671
<i>you want in the field,</i>

17:53.673 --> 17:55.840
<i>somebody who can problem
solve on the go.</i>

17:55.842 --> 18:00.344
<i>- But at the I-Beam Gap,
the 41-year-old needed backup.</i>

18:00.346 --> 18:03.448
<i>- No, no, no.
- Oh.</i>

18:03.450 --> 18:07.118
<i>- Then it was New Jersey
auditor Anthony DeFranco,</i>

18:07.120 --> 18:08.953
<i>who's known for his speed.</i>

18:08.955 --> 18:10.855
<i>- Ooh, look at him go.</i>

18:10.857 --> 18:13.224
<i>- But the former
track star's impressive</i>

18:13.226 --> 18:15.493
<i>run came to an end
at the Nail Clipper.</i>

18:15.495 --> 18:18.763
<i>Oh.</i>

18:18.765 --> 18:22.100
<i>And just starting on the
course, from Maineville, Ohio,</i>

18:22.102 --> 18:25.269
<i>is pharmaceutical sales rep
Naeem Mulkey,</i>

18:25.271 --> 18:27.872
<i>and he's through
the Floating Steps.</i>

18:27.874 --> 18:30.374
<i>As you can see,
this is a big energy guy.</i>

18:30.376 --> 18:32.376
<i>His wife Kellie
on the sideline,</i>

18:32.378 --> 18:36.047
<i>along with a big group
for Team Naeem.</i>

18:36.049 --> 18:38.049
<i>Now steps up
to the Rolling Log.</i>

18:38.051 --> 18:39.851
<i>- This guy is a 37-year-old
rookie,</i>

18:39.853 --> 18:42.687
<i>and let me tell you,
he is a CrossFit beast.</i>

18:42.689 --> 18:46.257
<i>He can dead lift
almost 500 pounds.</i>

18:46.259 --> 18:47.892
<i>- Those feet, though,
not locked.</i>

18:47.894 --> 18:49.227
<i>- Oh, he better watch out.</i>

18:49.229 --> 18:51.229
<i>- Got a little pincer grip.
- Whoa.</i>

18:51.231 --> 18:55.266
<i>- One leg comes flying off,
but somehow Mulkey survives.</i>

18:55.268 --> 18:59.637
<i>- That log will mess
with your head.</i>

18:59.639 --> 19:03.674
<i>Gave it a little kiss.</i>
[laughter]

19:03.676 --> 19:06.744
<i>- Now starts to climb up and
gives a smile to Team Naeem,</i>

19:06.746 --> 19:08.045
<i>including his sister.</i>

19:08.047 --> 19:09.614
<i>And just like him,
she is excited,</i>

19:09.616 --> 19:12.483
<i>but now it's this balance
obstacle, Razor's Edge.</i>

19:12.485 --> 19:15.453
<i>We've already seen a couple
athletes go out here.</i>

19:15.455 --> 19:17.188
<i>- He's from the Buckeye State,</i>

19:17.190 --> 19:19.490
<i>representing
for the Buckeye State.</i>

19:19.492 --> 19:22.160
<i>- A little bow to the
obstacle he just conquered.</i>

19:24.898 --> 19:28.332
<i>And now steps up to take on
the Ring Jump.</i>

19:28.334 --> 19:30.635
<i>These pegs are farther apart
than in qualifying,</i>

19:30.637 --> 19:32.970
<i>so a bigger gap to jump.</i>

19:32.972 --> 19:34.005
<i>- We've seen a lot of
different</i>

19:34.007 --> 19:35.306
<i>techniques on this one.</i>

19:35.308 --> 19:37.175
<i>We've seen people
go backwards,</i>

19:37.177 --> 19:39.577
<i>but Naeem's
going straight ahead.</i>

19:39.579 --> 19:41.679
<i>Get the swing and reach out.</i>

19:41.681 --> 19:44.282
<i>- Good job out
of the 5'7" Mulkey.</i>

19:44.284 --> 19:46.350
<i>- As little time
as possible here.</i>

19:46.352 --> 19:48.686
<i>On the back foot, get up.</i>

19:48.688 --> 19:50.354
<i>And up, up and over.</i>

19:50.356 --> 19:52.657
<i>- There we go.
- Kind of counterintuitive.</i>

19:52.659 --> 19:54.091
<i>You have to do it
on the backswing.</i>

19:54.093 --> 19:57.195
<i>- That backswing and up
and over. Whoo!</i>

19:57.197 --> 19:58.629
<i>- That ring moved with him.</i>

19:58.631 --> 20:00.264
<i>That was good power
out of Mulkey.</i>

20:00.266 --> 20:02.166
<i>- And the fact that he didn't
let go</i>

20:02.168 --> 20:04.368
<i>with all that turbulence.</i>

20:04.370 --> 20:05.570
<i>- But this is where he
went out</i>

20:05.572 --> 20:08.239
<i>in qualifying,
this I-Beam Gap.</i>

20:08.241 --> 20:11.309
<i>He made it halfway
but couldn't pull himself up.</i>

20:11.311 --> 20:15.680
- You got this.
- You got this.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.315
<i>- He's got a lot of muscles,</i>

20:17.317 --> 20:22.286
<i>but this requires
fingers and feet.</i>

20:22.288 --> 20:27.658
<i>Lock in those heels and watch
this 2-foot gap here.</i>

20:27.660 --> 20:28.926
<i>- He is locked in and loaded.</i>

20:28.928 --> 20:31.829
<i>- Whoa. Whoa.
- And there it is.</i>

20:31.831 --> 20:33.164
<i>And the reason
that's important</i>

20:33.166 --> 20:34.999
<i>is that
really taxes the upper body.</i>

20:35.001 --> 20:37.335
<i>- And this is where he fell
in qualifying,</i>

20:37.337 --> 20:39.804
<i>trying to pull himself up.</i>

20:39.806 --> 20:41.138
<i>- These athletes,
they go home,</i>

20:41.140 --> 20:42.640
<i>they train to get better,</i>

20:42.642 --> 20:44.642
<i>and he looks like he's figured
this one out.</i>

20:44.644 --> 20:46.510
<i>Wow.</i>

20:46.512 --> 20:48.646
- Come on, baby.
- You got this.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.148
<i>- And now has to jump over
to the other side.</i>

20:51.150 --> 20:54.919
<i>6 1/2 feet.
He's only 5'7".</i>

20:54.921 --> 20:56.821
<i>He's got it.</i>

20:56.823 --> 20:58.889
<i>Mulkey, though, not home free.</i>

20:58.891 --> 21:00.658
<i>Those hands are sliding down,</i>

21:00.660 --> 21:02.994
<i>just barely able
to catch himself.</i>

21:02.996 --> 21:05.630
<i>- I'm telling you, that can
really wear out your grip.</i>

21:05.632 --> 21:07.598
<i>- Well, really relying
on those fingertips.</i>

21:07.600 --> 21:11.002
<i>- Oh, boy, he's struggling.
- He needs to get off right now.</i>

21:11.004 --> 21:16.540
<i>- And Mulkey gets through,
but he looks exhausted.</i>

21:16.542 --> 21:19.610
Now he's gonna face
his first-ever Warped Wall.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.979
[together] Beat that wall.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.582
- This wall, 14 1/2 feet high.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.184
Can this 37-year-old rookie
get through it?

21:27.186 --> 21:28.552
- So far I like what I see.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.622
Already an impressive run.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.358
- And he makes it.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.861
Naeem Mulkey moving on.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.933
- Hey, Naeem the dream.
- Naeem the dream.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.368
This is your dream.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.370
<i>- But this dream can turn
into a nightmare</i>

21:46.372 --> 21:48.072
<i>as things get hard.</i>

21:48.074 --> 21:49.974
<i>He's facing
the upper-body obstacles</i>

21:49.976 --> 21:51.375
<i>added for the city finals,</i>

21:51.377 --> 21:53.277
<i>starting with
the Salmon Ladder.</i>

21:53.279 --> 21:55.046
- Team Naeem, Team Naeem.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.048
<i>- They just got real
on this back half.</i>

21:57.050 --> 21:59.650
<i>He looks a little winded
from those earlier obstacles.</i>

21:59.652 --> 22:03.187
<i>- He's up. Has to jump
that bar up four rungs.</i>

22:03.189 --> 22:06.557
<i>Oh, misses on one side.
Good correction.</i>

22:06.559 --> 22:08.793
<i>- You got to earn your way.
- One more rung, got it.</i>

22:08.795 --> 22:10.394
<i>- Nice.
- And now moves on</i>

22:10.396 --> 22:12.897
<i>to the eighth obstacle,
the Nail Clipper.</i>

22:12.899 --> 22:15.333
<i>- And I think this is gonna
be trouble tonight.</i>

22:15.335 --> 22:17.001
<i>- Well, we've already seen
how hard it is</i>

22:17.003 --> 22:18.769
<i>to reach around to get a grip.</i>

22:18.771 --> 22:21.339
<i>There are only small
handholds to grab onto.</i>

22:21.341 --> 22:23.741
<i>You can see Mulkey
struggling to figure out</i>

22:23.743 --> 22:25.343
<i>where to place his hands.</i>

22:25.345 --> 22:27.978
<i>Has to reach out
to that second cylinder.</i>

22:27.980 --> 22:30.348
- No!

22:30.350 --> 22:33.551
<i>- Mulkey's grip gives out
as he reaches</i>

22:33.553 --> 22:36.053
<i>for that second cylinder,
but a good run.</i>

22:36.055 --> 22:39.557
<i>We'll have to wait and see if
that keeps him in the top 15.</i>

22:39.559 --> 22:41.459
<i>- He nearly slid off
the I-Beam Gap,</i>

22:41.461 --> 22:44.095
<i>and he used a lot
of upper-body strength</i>

22:44.097 --> 22:45.696
<i>to get through that obstacle,</i>

22:45.698 --> 22:47.465
<i>so when he reached
the Nail Clipper,</i>

22:47.467 --> 22:50.101
<i>watch as he shifts his weight
to the second cylinder.</i>

22:50.103 --> 22:54.171
<i>That's a difficult move,
and he had no grip left.</i>

22:54.173 --> 22:56.540
- I'm so stoked to get this
far on the course.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.877
It's amazing.
What an experience down here.

22:59.879 --> 23:03.280
<i>- Well, up next is a small guy
who came up big in qualifying.</i>

23:03.282 --> 23:08.519
<i>This is 5'4" gym owner
Sean Noel from Hilliard, Ohio.</i>

23:08.521 --> 23:11.222
<i>He changed his life around
by going gluten-free,</i>

23:11.224 --> 23:12.490
<i>and he had a memorable</i>

23:12.492 --> 23:14.325
<i>submission tape
to make his case.</i>

23:18.064 --> 23:21.198
<i>- Oh, hi.
- I'm just rolling through.</i>

23:21.200 --> 23:22.400
<i>I'm sure you're wondering why</i>

23:22.402 --> 23:23.734
<i>all this bread is coming
at me.</i>

23:23.736 --> 23:25.403
<i>Well, that's because
I'm a celiac.</i>

23:25.405 --> 23:28.239
<i>I was diagnosed from celiac
disease at nine years old.</i>

23:28.241 --> 23:31.575
It makes me unable
to digest bread or gluten.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.345
<i>I couldn't eat cake.
I couldn't eat pizza.</i>

23:34.347 --> 23:36.180
<i>I couldn't even
eat burritos, man.</i>

23:36.182 --> 23:37.948
<i>Burritos.</i>

23:37.950 --> 23:41.385
<i>Currently, I eat mainly
fruits, vegetables, and meat.</i>

23:43.856 --> 23:47.425
I am feeling way better.

23:47.427 --> 23:51.529
<i>Uh-uh,
it can't touch any of this.</i>

23:51.531 --> 23:53.697
<i>- And besides
owning his own gym,</i>

23:53.699 --> 23:55.966
<i>Sean also works
at Michelle Warnky's gym,</i>

23:55.968 --> 23:58.302
<i>and she's on the sideline,
cheering him on.</i>

23:58.304 --> 23:59.904
[countdown clock beeping]

23:59.906 --> 24:02.807
<i>We told you Noel's
only 5'4",</i>

24:02.809 --> 24:04.442
<i>the smallest male athlete
competing tonight.</i>

24:04.444 --> 24:06.877
<i>But don't underestimate him.</i>

24:06.879 --> 24:09.547
<i>He had the third-fastest time
in qualifying.</i>

24:09.549 --> 24:11.916
<i>- Yeah, he was right behind
Joe Moravsky.</i>

24:11.918 --> 24:13.551
<i>He's ready to run
with the big boys.</i>

24:13.553 --> 24:15.319
- Yeah!

24:15.321 --> 24:18.022
<i>- This guy is proud
of his upper-body strength.</i>

24:18.024 --> 24:20.157
<i>Says he has the unofficial
Guinness World Record</i>

24:20.159 --> 24:22.960
<i>for pull-ups in a minute, 51.</i>

24:22.962 --> 24:24.328
<i>- He can do a lot of pull-ups,</i>

24:24.330 --> 24:25.596
<i>but he's got to hold
this thing,</i>

24:25.598 --> 24:26.697
<i>so he can spin.</i>

24:29.869 --> 24:32.770
<i>- Oh.</i>

24:32.772 --> 24:36.373
<i>Wow, Michelle Warnky
can't believe it.</i>

24:36.375 --> 24:38.409
<i>And neither can Sean Noel.</i>

24:38.411 --> 24:40.344
<i>We thought he had
the potential to go far.</i>

24:40.346 --> 24:42.913
<i>Instead, he's going home.</i>

24:42.915 --> 24:46.484
<i>- You can't take any obstacle
for granted. Look right here.</i>

24:46.486 --> 24:48.519
<i>The log is above
the landing pad,</i>

24:48.521 --> 24:50.421
<i>and Sean Noel looks safe,</i>

24:50.423 --> 24:52.256
<i>but the force from that
spinning log</i>

24:52.258 --> 24:55.426
<i>just flings him
right back into the water.</i>

24:55.428 --> 24:58.028
<i>- Well, something big is
coming up.</i>

24:58.030 --> 25:00.931
<i>6'6" Jon Alexis Jr.,</i>

25:00.933 --> 25:03.067
<i>the giant, is getting loose.</i>

25:03.069 --> 25:05.803
<i>We'll see his run
when we come back.</i>

25:05.805 --> 25:08.272
<i>But so far, the
Nail Clipper's looking like</i>

25:08.274 --> 25:09.573
<i>the giant killer tonight.</i>

25:09.575 --> 25:11.642
<i>Ooh!</i>

25:11.644 --> 25:13.310
<i>In earlier runs, it knocked
out</i>

25:13.312 --> 25:15.579
<i>Ohio chef Patrick Lavanty...</i>

25:15.581 --> 25:17.681
<i>- It just added up
for the chef.</i>

25:17.683 --> 25:20.050
<i>- New York City's
Jonathan Angelilli...</i>

25:20.052 --> 25:22.219
<i>- That's hard. That is hard.</i>

25:22.221 --> 25:23.821
<i>- And New Jersey auctioneer</i>

25:23.823 --> 25:28.025
<i>Judas Licciardello, who
went out with a big splash.</i>

25:28.027 --> 25:29.760
<i>- Whoa.</i>

25:29.762 --> 25:32.663
<i>- But there's more to come on
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

25:34.165 --> 25:34.198
.

25:36.301 --> 25:37.935
<i>- Welcome back to Cleveland.</i>

25:37.937 --> 25:40.304
<i>Our aerial coverage
is provided by Goodyear,</i>

25:40.306 --> 25:42.072
<i>the tires chosen by experts</i>

25:42.074 --> 25:43.440
<i>for superior performance</i>

25:43.442 --> 25:45.376
<i>in challenging conditions.</i>

25:45.378 --> 25:47.511
<i>Goodyear, more driven.</i>

25:47.513 --> 25:49.880
<i>While we were away,
two more competitors</i>

25:49.882 --> 25:52.983
<i>tried to earn a ticket
to the national finals.</i>

25:52.985 --> 25:55.719
<i>Tori Clement is a former
roommate of fellow</i>

25:55.721 --> 25:57.721
<i>competitor
Jesse "Flex" Labreck.</i>

25:57.723 --> 25:59.657
- Yeah, Tori!

25:59.659 --> 26:02.192
<i>- She made it to the Ring Jump
in qualifying,</i>

26:02.194 --> 26:03.994
<i>but the ninja rookie
rolled off headfirst</i>

26:03.996 --> 26:05.796
<i>on the Rolling Log.</i>

26:05.798 --> 26:08.332
<i>- Oh, I saw it coming.</i>

26:08.334 --> 26:12.403
<i>- Connecticut's Derek Mathews
is known as the Bug Man.</i>

26:12.405 --> 26:15.773
<i>Nicknamed Bug by his mom; said
he looked like a glowworm.</i>

26:15.775 --> 26:17.074
<i>The graphic design student</i>

26:17.076 --> 26:18.609
<i>looked good
until the back half,</i>

26:18.611 --> 26:21.478
<i>when he was eaten up
by the Salmon Ladder.</i>

26:21.480 --> 26:22.546
<i>Look at him up there, one...</i>

26:22.548 --> 26:24.448
<i>both: Oh!</i>

26:27.820 --> 26:30.321
<i>- Up next is one of
the biggest ninja stars.</i>

26:30.323 --> 26:34.291
<i>It's the Giant, 6'6"
Jon Alexis Jr.,</i>

26:34.293 --> 26:37.161
<i>the pride
of Waterville, Maine.</i>

26:37.163 --> 26:39.229
<i>- And he's got the dance moves
going</i>

26:39.231 --> 26:41.298
<i>and now pumping the crowd up.</i>

26:41.300 --> 26:43.567
<i>- This guy ran up
a 19-foot Warped Wall</i>

26:43.569 --> 26:45.336
<i>in our skills challenge
last year,</i>

26:45.338 --> 26:49.740
<i>but he likes
to fly even higher.</i>

26:49.742 --> 26:51.675
<i>- The thing that really drove
me into skydiving</i>

26:51.677 --> 26:55.446
is the desire
to have super powers

26:55.448 --> 26:58.215
<i>and having the ability to fly
or kind of simulate flight.</i>

27:01.354 --> 27:04.722
<i>And it's just, like, a totally
new perspective on the world.</i>

27:04.724 --> 27:07.157
<i>It's pretty high intensity.</i>

27:07.159 --> 27:09.026
<i>Free fall isn't the scariest
part of skydiving.</i>

27:09.028 --> 27:11.061
<i>It's definitely when you
pull the parachute.</i>

27:11.063 --> 27:12.696
<i>Usually you're hoping
it's gonna open right.</i>

27:15.334 --> 27:17.067
<i>Every time I'm jumped,
it's been perfect,</i>

27:17.069 --> 27:21.271
<i>so I just have to make sure
I steer safely to the ground.</i>

27:21.273 --> 27:23.040
<i>- Look at the big fella,
6'6" in the track stance.</i>

27:23.042 --> 27:24.808
<i>- He's going fast.</i>

27:24.810 --> 27:27.277
<i>- In some ways, ninja warrior
is comparable to skydiving.</i>

27:27.279 --> 27:29.246
<i>I feel like I'm in my element
with both of them.</i>

27:29.248 --> 27:31.382
<i>It's something
I really enjoy doing.</i>

27:31.384 --> 27:33.117
<i>- 19 feet!</i>

27:33.119 --> 27:35.819
<i>- I feel so myself and alive
when I'm in the middle of it.</i>

27:35.821 --> 27:37.154
<i>- Look at the big fella,</i>

27:37.156 --> 27:38.756
<i>rolling like he done
lost his mind.</i>

27:38.758 --> 27:40.491
<i>- It's just really cool
to plummet towards the Earth.</i>

27:40.493 --> 27:43.227
<i>I mean, it's pretty crazy,</i>

27:43.229 --> 27:44.361
and I kind of like crazy.

27:47.533 --> 27:49.867
<i>- He's got a big group
of supporters here,</i>

27:49.869 --> 27:52.336
<i>including his dad,
Jon Alexis Sr.,</i>

27:52.338 --> 27:55.239
<i>who himself has competed
on "American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

27:55.241 --> 27:56.674
<i>and Flex Labreck.</i>

27:56.676 --> 27:58.042
<i>They were on
the same high school</i>

27:58.044 --> 27:59.243
<i>track team back in Maine.</i>

27:59.245 --> 28:01.045
- You got this! Let's go!

28:01.047 --> 28:03.280
<i>- Look at this, he's loaded
in his track stance to start.</i>

28:03.282 --> 28:05.616
[countdown clock beeping]

28:05.618 --> 28:08.786
<i>- And the Giant striding
through the Floating Steps.</i>

28:08.788 --> 28:10.487
<i>Always makes me nervous</i>

28:10.489 --> 28:12.089
<i>but just looks
so comfortable there.</i>

28:12.091 --> 28:13.424
<i>- Oh, he's doing
the counter-spin</i>

28:13.426 --> 28:15.359
<i>before he gets
on the Rolling Log.</i>

28:15.361 --> 28:18.796
<i>- He's got an aggressive pace
here.</i>

28:18.798 --> 28:19.830
<i>- I like that.</i>

28:19.832 --> 28:23.133
<i>- 6'6", 190.</i>

28:23.135 --> 28:25.436
<i>Impressive, gets right
through the Rolling Log.</i>

28:25.438 --> 28:27.037
<i>- Look at that.
- Okay, doing the counter-spin</i>

28:27.039 --> 28:29.740
<i>again before
and after Rolling Log.</i>

28:29.742 --> 28:32.009
<i>- Well, he's a former
sprinter. He needs to use</i>

28:32.011 --> 28:36.146
<i>those big strides now
to get across Razor's Edge.</i>

28:36.148 --> 28:39.349
<i>Right through it.</i>

28:39.351 --> 28:42.119
<i>And wasting no time,
on to Ring Jump.</i>

28:42.121 --> 28:44.121
<i>This guy has such
tremendous speed.</i>

28:44.123 --> 28:45.889
<i>- Matt, he turns it up
in the finals.</i>

28:45.891 --> 28:50.427
<i>He didn't look this strong
and fast in the qualifying.</i>

28:50.429 --> 28:53.497
<i>- And makes a quick dismount.</i>

28:53.499 --> 28:55.099
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.500
<i>- Now facing the obstacle
that took him out</i>

28:56.502 --> 28:58.969
<i>in qualifying, the I-Beam Gap.</i>

28:58.971 --> 29:01.105
<i>- And in that run, he got to
the end of the first beam</i>

29:01.107 --> 29:04.541
<i>and just seemed
to really run out of gas.</i>

29:04.543 --> 29:09.379
<i>- He's being careful on these
ledges with those long legs.</i>

29:09.381 --> 29:11.482
<i>- This is the spot where he
had trouble</i>

29:11.484 --> 29:13.117
<i>pulling himself up.</i>

29:13.119 --> 29:14.718
<i>- Well, you can tell these
ninjas have been training</i>

29:14.720 --> 29:16.854
<i>for this since qualifying.</i>

29:16.856 --> 29:19.990
<i>We're seeing a lot more
success, and Alexis is up.</i>

29:19.992 --> 29:21.658
<i>- And he's going right into
the splits</i>

29:21.660 --> 29:23.193
<i>with those daddy long legs.</i>

29:23.195 --> 29:26.096
<i>- Doing some dance moves,
and he just winked.</i>

29:26.098 --> 29:27.698
<i>He winked at our camera.</i>

29:27.700 --> 29:30.734
<i>- I told you. You can see
the confidence in him.</i>

29:30.736 --> 29:32.202
<i>- And look, he's peeking
around the edge</i>

29:32.204 --> 29:33.971
<i>to find the gaps.</i>

29:33.973 --> 29:36.940
<i>- Ooh, ooh. What is he doing?
- He's fishing.</i>

29:36.942 --> 29:38.275
<i>- You can see,
it's hard to see</i>

29:38.277 --> 29:40.577
<i>where the gap's cut
out there.</i>

29:40.579 --> 29:42.880
<i>- Yeah, very close.
- Watch out, watch out.</i>

29:42.882 --> 29:46.750
<i>- 190 pounds, can he get
that dismount? Got it.</i>

29:46.752 --> 29:48.685
And now it's the Warped Wall,

29:48.687 --> 29:51.655
but as we said, this guy ran up
a 19-foot wall

29:51.657 --> 29:53.557
in our all-star
skills challenge,

29:53.559 --> 29:56.960
so this shouldn't be a problem,
and it's not.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.530
He just walks up to the top,

29:59.532 --> 30:02.633
and he gives a bow to the front
half of the course.

30:02.635 --> 30:05.369
Now moving on to the much
more challenging back half.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.538
<i>Can Jon Alexis Jr.</i>

30:07.540 --> 30:09.640
<i>be the first to solve
the Nail Clipper,</i>

30:09.642 --> 30:12.009
<i>perhaps
our first finisher?</i>

30:12.011 --> 30:13.844
- Here we go. Come on.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.646
<i>- Well, the first test
is the Salmon Ladder.</i>

30:15.648 --> 30:18.482
<i>Don't trip.</i>

30:18.484 --> 30:20.617
<i>- Wow, skipping runs.
- I'm telling you,</i>

30:20.619 --> 30:22.753
<i>there's something different
about the Giant.</i>

30:22.755 --> 30:24.454
<i>- And on to the Nail Clipper.</i>

30:24.456 --> 30:26.723
<i>This came from our
Obstacle Design Challenge</i>

30:26.725 --> 30:30.427
<i>and submitted by 16-year-old
Calvin Boyce from Provo, Utah.</i>

30:30.429 --> 30:31.862
<i>If you've got an obstacle
idea,</i>

30:31.864 --> 30:34.231
<i>just go to ANWNation.com.</i>

30:34.233 --> 30:37.167
<i>Four cylinders, no one's even
made it past this second one.</i>

30:37.169 --> 30:40.037
<i>Oh, my. Well,
even with his long reach,</i>

30:40.039 --> 30:43.340
<i>the Giant couldn't get past
the Nail Clipper,</i>

30:43.342 --> 30:45.008
<i>but he had a fast pace
to this point.</i>

30:45.010 --> 30:48.812
<i>We'll see if that run gets him
to the national finals.</i>

30:48.814 --> 30:51.582
<i>- Well, Alexis definitely
had fun out there,</i>

30:51.584 --> 30:53.984
<i>doing a dance
while doing the splits</i>

30:53.986 --> 30:56.920
<i>and then winks to the camera.
Are you kidding me?</i>

30:56.922 --> 30:59.223
<i>And on the Salmon Ladder,
watch this move.</i>

30:59.225 --> 31:02.926
<i>Jumps up and goes
right up two rungs.</i>

31:02.928 --> 31:04.228
- I'm happy. I don't know
if it was fast enough,

31:04.230 --> 31:07.030
but hopefully it was.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.799
<i>- Well, it's looking like a
tough course</i>

31:08.801 --> 31:10.267
<i>here in Cleveland.</i>

31:10.269 --> 31:13.036
<i>Perhaps a superhero
can save the day.</i>

31:13.038 --> 31:15.172
<i>Captain NBC, Jamie Rahn</i>

31:15.174 --> 31:17.574
<i>will hit the course
when we come back.</i>

31:17.576 --> 31:20.777
<i>Plus, can your teacher
do this?</i>

31:20.779 --> 31:22.846
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

31:22.848 --> 31:24.481
<i>Fifth grade teacher
Allyssa Beird</i>

31:24.483 --> 31:27.818
<i>is back
for her final exam.</i>

31:27.820 --> 31:29.186
- This teacher's gonna school
the course.

31:29.188 --> 31:31.488
[together] Go, Ms. Beird!
Go, Ms. Beird!

31:31.490 --> 31:34.091
<i>- When "American Ninja
Warrior" returns.</i>

31:35.627 --> 31:35.659
.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.830
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

31:39.832 --> 31:42.399
<i>coming to you from Public
Square in downtown Cleveland.</i>

31:42.401 --> 31:44.401
We're midway through
the city finals round,

31:44.403 --> 31:46.069
and, Akbar, as we all know,

31:46.071 --> 31:48.171
Cleveland is home to the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame,

31:48.173 --> 31:51.308
but tonight this course has
the ninjas singing the blues.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.809
- Yeah, that's spot-on, Matt,

31:52.811 --> 31:55.145
and there's one obstacle
in particular

31:55.147 --> 31:57.748
that's doing nearly
all the damage.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.018
<i>This Nail Clipper
has been a ninja killer,</i>

32:01.020 --> 32:04.221
<i>and the numbers are
really starting to add up.</i>

32:04.223 --> 32:05.856
<i>Just in the last few minutes,</i>

32:05.858 --> 32:09.726
<i>we saw Vegas veteran
Dan Galiczynski,</i>

32:09.728 --> 32:12.195
<i>last year's hotshot rookie
Michael Torres...</i>

32:12.197 --> 32:13.597
<i>- Oh!</i>

32:13.599 --> 32:16.033
<i>- And college student
Tyler Cravens.</i>

32:16.035 --> 32:17.901
<i>- Oh, my.</i>

32:17.903 --> 32:20.837
<i>- In all, ten competitors
have made it here.</i>

32:20.839 --> 32:25.042
<i>No one has made it
through so far.</i>

32:25.044 --> 32:26.677
<i>- Well, it may take
a superhero</i>

32:26.679 --> 32:28.245
<i>to get past that obstacle.</i>

32:28.247 --> 32:31.014
<i>Luckily, we've got one.</i>

32:31.016 --> 32:34.151
<i>Coming to the starting line
is Captain NBC, Jamie Rahn.</i>

32:34.153 --> 32:36.753
<i>The green-haired gym owner
is a crowd favorite,</i>

32:36.755 --> 32:39.156
<i>and he makes a heart there.</i>

32:39.158 --> 32:40.924
<i>That's for his girlfriend Kim.</i>

32:40.926 --> 32:43.961
<i>They've got some
big news to share.</i>

32:43.963 --> 32:46.496
- A little up.
- Yeah, in that divot.

32:46.498 --> 32:49.032
<i>Me and Kim have been dating
for a little over two years.</i>

32:49.034 --> 32:50.500
Done.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.536
<i>We have a lot of fun together.
You going?</i>

32:52.538 --> 32:54.171
- I'm going swimming
in a waterfall.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.639
- Bye.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.442
Whether it's playing
board games or going for a run

32:58.444 --> 33:02.279
or spending time with the dog
or ninja training.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.914
Whee.

33:03.916 --> 33:06.116
<i>- Jamie's the most thoughtful,
the most creative,</i>

33:06.118 --> 33:08.151
<i>the most loving person I know.</i>

33:08.153 --> 33:09.286
<i>- Very recently,
we got engaged.</i>

33:09.288 --> 33:12.723
<i>both: We're engaged.</i>

33:12.725 --> 33:14.591
- So this is our
storyboard, right.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.126
<i>In terms of planning
the wedding,</i>

33:16.128 --> 33:18.028
<i>it's a lot of me and Kim</i>

33:18.030 --> 33:20.497
trying to figure out what we
like, what we want to do.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.266
I would like this to be, like,
okay, I'm now a superhero.

33:23.268 --> 33:24.735
You're a Disney princess.

33:24.737 --> 33:25.936
<i>- We're definitely throwing
a little bit</i>

33:25.938 --> 33:28.839
of ninja-superhero flair
into it.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.475
And this is where we're tying
in, really, the ninja aspect,

33:31.477 --> 33:33.610
since we're not gonna force
all our guests

33:33.612 --> 33:36.179
to go up the Warped Wall
coming into our reception.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.548
- I mean, I'm for it.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.650
<i>Doogie, our little ninja guy,
will be in the wedding.</i>

33:40.652 --> 33:42.452
<i>We'd like him
to be the ring bearer.</i>

33:42.454 --> 33:44.187
<i>He's already worn
a tux before,</i>

33:44.189 --> 33:48.125
so we know he can
handle looking nice.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.593
<i>About 70 of the 100 people</i>

33:49.595 --> 33:52.329
<i>coming are ninja people
that we're friends with.</i>

33:52.331 --> 33:54.598
<i>We're super excited
to share with our friends</i>

33:54.600 --> 33:56.333
<i>and really just celebrate</i>

33:56.335 --> 33:58.101
<i>all the fun times
we've had together</i>

33:58.103 --> 33:59.870
and that we plan
to have further on.

34:02.074 --> 34:05.409
<i>- Well, congrats to those two,
and Rahn's on the course</i>

34:05.411 --> 34:09.179
<i>finishing up
with the Ring Jump.</i>

34:09.181 --> 34:11.481
<i>And there's his bride-to-be,
Kim,</i>

34:11.483 --> 34:13.016
<i>who's wearing the green wig,</i>

34:13.018 --> 34:15.652
<i>along with Jamie's parents.</i>

34:15.654 --> 34:17.821
<i>- Looks like Jamie's gonna
take off the shirt</i>

34:17.822 --> 34:20.090
<i>before he takes
on the I-Beam Gap.</i>

34:20.092 --> 34:21.690
<i>- The crowd likes it.</i>

34:21.693 --> 34:23.726
<i>They're starting up
the Jamie chant.</i>

34:23.728 --> 34:25.594
<i>- Even Doogie likes it.</i>

34:25.597 --> 34:29.166
<i>- Here he goes on
the I-Beam Gap.</i>

34:29.168 --> 34:32.735
<i>Well, his goal, stage four,
all the way to the top.</i>

34:32.737 --> 34:34.571
<i>- Well, if anyone can do it,
it's Jamie Rahn.</i>

34:34.572 --> 34:37.139
<i>He's got the experience.
He's got the strength.</i>

34:37.141 --> 34:38.975
<i>- And he'll need
that strength here.</i>

34:38.976 --> 34:42.012
<i>This is the tough spot where
you have to pull yourself up.</i>

34:42.014 --> 34:45.549
<i>Look at that power.
He's doing it.</i>

34:45.551 --> 34:47.384
- Take your time.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.186
<i>- Now the jump
to the other side.</i>

34:49.188 --> 34:52.322
<i>- He's a superhero.
- He's probably just gonna fly.</i>

34:52.324 --> 34:53.989
<i>- Whoa-oh-oh!</i>

34:53.992 --> 34:56.827
<i>And he makes it.
Got to be careful though.</i>

34:56.829 --> 34:59.563
<i>It's easy to slide off
these narrow ledges.</i>

35:05.404 --> 35:07.904
<i>Got it.</i>

35:07.906 --> 35:09.806
And the Warped Wall is next.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.976
This should not be
a problem for Jamie Rahn.

35:12.978 --> 35:15.378
The real challenge
will come on the back half.

35:15.380 --> 35:16.446
- Go!

35:20.419 --> 35:24.588
- There it is,
and he just keeps going.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.857
<i>Now the drama begins.</i>

35:26.859 --> 35:28.725
<i>On this back half
of the course,</i>

35:28.727 --> 35:31.128
<i>no one has figured out
the Nail Clipper.</i>

35:31.130 --> 35:32.929
<i>- I think Jamie Rahn
can be the guy</i>

35:32.931 --> 35:34.664
<i>- to break through.</i>
- Come on, Jamie!

35:34.666 --> 35:38.702
<i>- Two members of last year's
Fantastic Four, Rahn's friends</i>

35:38.704 --> 35:40.504
<i>Rachel Goldstein
and Michelle Warnky,</i>

35:40.506 --> 35:42.772
<i>have joined in
to offer support.</i>

35:42.774 --> 35:44.541
<i>First up, the Salmon Ladder.</i>

35:44.543 --> 35:48.378
<i>His experience, Rahn should
be able to fly up this one.</i>

35:48.380 --> 35:50.180
<i>- I want you to watch
the speed that he does here.</i>

35:50.182 --> 35:53.517
<i>He is no joke
on the Salmon Ladder.</i>

35:53.519 --> 35:54.985
<i>Look at that, no joke.</i>

35:54.987 --> 35:56.119
<i>- Right up it.
- He ain't joking around.</i>

35:56.121 --> 35:57.387
<i>That's not the Joker.</i>

35:57.389 --> 35:58.688
<i>- So efficient,
trying to conserve</i>

35:58.690 --> 36:00.657
<i>that energy for this one.</i>

36:00.659 --> 36:02.359
<i>- Here we go.
- It's show time.</i>

36:02.361 --> 36:05.028
<i>Jamie Rahn is smart. He's
been watching others try it.</i>

36:05.030 --> 36:08.865
<i>I think he's got a chance
to figure it out.</i>

36:08.867 --> 36:12.469
<i>- No one tonight's made it
past that third cylinder.</i>

36:12.471 --> 36:15.572
<i>You can see how these
cylinders rotate clockwise.</i>

36:15.574 --> 36:17.274
<i>They'll lock in place as that
top handle</i>

36:17.276 --> 36:19.809
<i>moves to horizontal.</i>

36:19.811 --> 36:21.444
<i>- Look at the ninjas
on the sideline.</i>

36:21.446 --> 36:24.047
<i>They are watching, and they'd
better be taking notes.</i>

36:24.049 --> 36:25.549
<i>He's got the rhythm.</i>

36:25.551 --> 36:27.083
<i>- Oh, my.
- He's got the rhythm.</i>

36:27.085 --> 36:31.121
<i>- Jamie Rahn,
will he be the first?</i>

36:31.123 --> 36:32.422
<i>- Oh, boy.</i>

36:32.424 --> 36:35.792
<i>Jamie Rahn really
is a superhero.</i>

36:35.794 --> 36:39.129
<i>- Just the dismount.</i>

36:39.131 --> 36:43.333
<i>And Jamie Rahn, the first to
complete the Nail Clipper.</i>

36:43.335 --> 36:46.102
<i>This obstacle
looked unbeatable.</i>

36:46.104 --> 36:47.671
<i>Ten straight failures,</i>

36:47.673 --> 36:51.007
<i>but Jamie Rahn just proved
it can be beaten.</i>

36:51.009 --> 36:52.776
<i>- And, Matt, these athletes
learn from watching</i>

36:52.778 --> 36:54.477
<i>other ninjas.</i>

36:54.479 --> 36:56.880
<i>We're gonna see some others
copy what Rahn did here.</i>

36:56.882 --> 36:59.849
<i>- The question now, how far
can Jamie Rahn go?</i>

36:59.851 --> 37:02.619
<i>Up next, the ninth obstacle,
the Clacker.</i>

37:02.621 --> 37:04.688
<i>- I thought it was
the Clapper.</i>

37:04.690 --> 37:06.923
<i>- No, Jamie,
it's not the Clapper.</i>

37:06.925 --> 37:09.893
<i>- Clap on, clap off.
- No, it's the Clacker.</i>

37:09.895 --> 37:11.928
<i>- We saw this last year
in Atlanta.</i>

37:11.930 --> 37:14.497
<i>You have to flip those
levers up and over.</i>

37:14.499 --> 37:16.233
<i>There are ten in all.
You can hear them.</i>

37:16.235 --> 37:18.268
<i>Look at that, really
making good progress.</i>

37:18.270 --> 37:19.803
<i>- And the change here.
- Now he's got to be able</i>

37:19.805 --> 37:22.138
<i>to transfer over,
then try to make that...</i>

37:22.140 --> 37:23.573
<i>oh, going backwards,</i>

37:23.575 --> 37:26.142
<i>showing a little bit
of shoulder flexibility.</i>

37:26.144 --> 37:28.211
<i>- And look at this.
- Jamie Rahn.</i>

37:28.213 --> 37:31.648
<i>- I think he is a superhero.</i>

37:31.650 --> 37:33.350
<i>- And now he's close enough.</i>

37:33.352 --> 37:37.654
<i>He may skip the final ones
and go for the dismount.</i>

37:37.656 --> 37:40.557
<i>He skipped the final handles,</i>

37:40.559 --> 37:44.327
<i>and Jamie Rahn,
35 feet away from a buzzer.</i>

37:44.329 --> 37:45.929
<i>- Oh, man.</i>

37:45.931 --> 37:48.164
<i>- And so now it's this
deadly tenth obstacle,</i>

37:48.166 --> 37:50.500
<i>the Elevator Climb.</i>

37:50.502 --> 37:52.802
<i>The last two weeks,
no one got through it</i>

37:52.804 --> 37:54.771
<i>until the final runner
of the night.</i>

37:54.773 --> 37:57.040
<i>Jamie Rahn trying to get
early success</i>

37:57.042 --> 37:58.475
<i>on this brutal obstacle.</i>

37:58.477 --> 38:00.076
- Let's see it, Jame.

38:00.078 --> 38:03.246
<i>- Has to work those handles
35 feet to the top.</i>

38:03.248 --> 38:04.648
<i>We've only had six people</i>

38:04.650 --> 38:06.483
<i>finish this thing
all season long.</i>

38:06.485 --> 38:08.151
<i>It's that tough.</i>

38:08.153 --> 38:12.155
- Nice and strong.
- Let's see a buzzer.

38:12.157 --> 38:13.923
<i>- And here he goes.</i>

38:13.925 --> 38:15.158
<i>After the Nail Clipper
and the Clacker,</i>

38:15.160 --> 38:18.161
<i>does he have enough left?</i>

38:18.163 --> 38:21.431
<i>- We've had so many gas out
halfway up this thing.</i>

38:21.433 --> 38:23.400
<i>Rahn's taking a slow
and steady approach.</i>

38:23.402 --> 38:25.035
<i>- Come on.
- 15 feet up.</i>

38:25.037 --> 38:26.803
<i>Rahn, though, looking gassed.</i>

38:26.805 --> 38:28.571
<i>- Oh, man, Matt,
he's feeling it.</i>

38:28.573 --> 38:32.242
- Come on, Jamie.
- You got this!

38:32.244 --> 38:34.277
<i>- Jamie Rahn, the first
to even make it here</i>

38:34.279 --> 38:35.879
<i>to this tenth obstacle.</i>

38:35.881 --> 38:38.748
<i>- Smell the victory, smell it.
- You can get there.</i>

38:38.750 --> 38:41.818
<i>- Amazing.
- He dominated nine obstacles.</i>

38:41.820 --> 38:43.987
<i>This tenth obstacle,
the Elevator Climb,</i>

38:43.989 --> 38:48.858
<i>push the button
and get to the penthouse.</i>

38:48.860 --> 38:50.360
<i>- And now he's picking up
the pace.</i>

38:50.362 --> 38:52.195
<i>- Uh-oh, uh-oh. What?</i>

38:52.197 --> 38:54.230
[cheers and applause]

38:54.232 --> 38:58.668
<i>- Somehow still fighting.</i>

38:58.670 --> 39:00.003
<i>Yes!</i>

39:00.005 --> 39:01.604
<i>- He's getting to
the penthouse.</i>

39:01.606 --> 39:04.841
<i>- His feet are up.
- So close.</i>

39:07.612 --> 39:09.713
<i>Yes, he's gonna do it.</i>

39:09.715 --> 39:13.450
<i>- The superhero
is at the penthouse.</i>

39:13.452 --> 39:17.020
<i>- Break out the green wigs.</i>

39:17.022 --> 39:20.824
Jamie Rahn is going back
to Vegas, and he's the first

39:20.826 --> 39:23.860
to hit a buzzer
here in Cleveland.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.328
- Whoo!

39:25.330 --> 39:27.931
<i>- That was big time,
and we're gonna go ahead</i>

39:27.933 --> 39:30.033
<i>and make that our
POM Wonderful</i>

39:30.035 --> 39:31.768
<i>Crazy Healthy Run
of the Night.</i>

39:31.770 --> 39:34.838
<i>Jamie Rahn was the first
to get past the Nail Clipper,</i>

39:34.840 --> 39:37.273
<i>the first to get past
the Clacker,</i>

39:37.275 --> 39:39.976
<i>and the first to hit
the buzzer tonight.</i>

39:39.978 --> 39:41.978
<i>- And he's standing by
with Kristine.</i>

39:41.980 --> 39:44.280
- Jamie, congratulations.

39:44.282 --> 39:47.083
Hi, buddy. He looked like
he was running away.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.685
What was going on?

39:48.687 --> 39:50.353
- No, he's got to pee, I'm
sure. He's been here all night.

39:50.355 --> 39:53.156
- He's just so excited for you,
as are we.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.458
I want to start back
with the Nail Clipper.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.861
How were you able
to make it through?

39:57.863 --> 40:00.096
- I knew I would just keep
moving smooth

40:00.098 --> 40:02.232
<i>if I match, move, match, move,</i>

40:02.234 --> 40:04.367
<i>I was gonna get through
before I got too tired.</i>

40:04.369 --> 40:05.668
- And the Elevator Climb.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.570
It looked like you
almost got a second wind

40:07.572 --> 40:09.439
when you were halfway up.
What was going on?

40:09.441 --> 40:12.242
- It felt like I lost the wind.
- It was good.

40:12.244 --> 40:14.711
<i>I had to close my eyes
and just gut it out.</i>

40:14.713 --> 40:16.646
- Congratulations, Jamie.
- We're so proud of you.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.114
- Oh, thank you so much.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.817
- Guys, back to you.

40:20.819 --> 40:24.087
<i>- So Jamie Rahn's our only
finisher so far.</i>

40:24.089 --> 40:27.690
<i>Remember, only the top 15
competitors and top two women</i>

40:27.692 --> 40:31.127
<i>will move on to
the national finals.</i>

40:31.129 --> 40:33.663
<i>Well, they don't call
her Flex for nothing.</i>

40:33.665 --> 40:36.900
<i>Jesse Labreck is one of our
strongest competitors.</i>

40:36.902 --> 40:39.803
<i>How far can she go
on this course tonight?</i>

40:39.805 --> 40:41.938
<i>Her run is up next.</i>

40:41.940 --> 40:45.875
<i>And later, he was
a breakout star last year.</i>

40:45.877 --> 40:48.211
<i>- Whoo!
- I see you, baby.</i>

40:48.213 --> 40:50.613
<i>- Now the Phoenix,
Najee Richardson,</i>

40:50.615 --> 40:53.016
<i>is ready to fly even higher.</i>

40:53.018 --> 40:55.185
- The Phoenix is gonna fly
through the finals.

40:55.187 --> 40:56.519
<i>- His run's coming up,</i>

40:56.521 --> 40:58.888
<i>when "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

41:01.058 --> 41:01.090
.

41:03.828 --> 41:06.029
<i>- She's a Labreck house.</i>

41:06.031 --> 41:08.665
<i>- Last year,
Jesse "Flex" Labreck</i>

41:08.667 --> 41:10.733
<i>became just the fourth woman
ever</i>

41:10.735 --> 41:12.769
<i>to reach
the ninth obstacle,</i>

41:12.771 --> 41:14.437
<i>and she did it as a rookie.</i>

41:14.439 --> 41:15.538
<i>- Yes!</i>

41:17.342 --> 41:21.244
<i>- This year, she's already
hit one buzzer.</i>

41:21.246 --> 41:24.614
<i>Tonight, she's gunning
for another.</i>

41:24.616 --> 41:27.617
<i>Here she comes, but there
have been some big changes</i>

41:27.619 --> 41:29.886
<i>for Jesse Labreck
in the past few months.</i>

41:29.888 --> 41:31.855
<i>For one, she's got
her new boyfriend,</i>

41:31.857 --> 41:33.823
<i>fellow competitor
Chris DiGangi,</i>

41:33.825 --> 41:35.992
<i>and she's had to leave
Emeline,</i>

41:35.994 --> 41:38.127
<i>the young woman
with cerebral palsy</i>

41:38.129 --> 41:41.197
<i>that she's cared for over
the past two years.</i>

41:41.199 --> 41:42.732
<i>That's because
Flex has followed</i>

41:42.734 --> 41:44.501
<i>her dreams to Illinois.</i>

41:47.172 --> 41:50.406
- Chris and I have moved to
a new gym outside of Chicago

41:50.408 --> 41:53.176
in Naperville.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.478
<i>It's an amazing new job
at United Ninjas,</i>

41:55.480 --> 41:57.614
<i>and I am the classes manager.</i>

41:57.616 --> 42:01.084
- All right, guys, you ready?
- Yeah!

42:01.086 --> 42:03.920
<i>- What I love about my new job
is teaching kids</i>

42:03.922 --> 42:06.055
<i>stuff that they really want
to learn,</i>

42:06.057 --> 42:09.025
<i>fun stuff, like ninja.</i>

42:09.027 --> 42:10.126
- Good job.

42:10.128 --> 42:11.628
<i>- It makes me feel really good</i>

42:11.630 --> 42:13.062
<i>that they're coming
and asking me,</i>

42:13.064 --> 42:16.065
<i>because they've seen
what I can do.</i>

42:16.067 --> 42:17.400
<i>- She's an amazing coach.</i>

42:17.402 --> 42:21.170
I'm completely in awe
of her, constantly.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.939
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's hear it.

42:22.941 --> 42:24.274
Let's hear it.

42:24.276 --> 42:25.775
<i>- Flex Labreck,</i>

42:25.777 --> 42:30.680
<i>and Emeline's smiling;
says it all, really.</i>

42:30.682 --> 42:32.949
<i>- It was definitely really
hard to leave Emeline,</i>

42:32.951 --> 42:34.250
<i>but when I talked with her,
you know,</i>

42:34.252 --> 42:35.919
<i>she was super supportive,</i>

42:35.921 --> 42:38.888
<i>and she was excited for me.</i>

42:38.890 --> 42:40.423
We message all the time.

42:40.425 --> 42:42.659
We talk all the time,
and she loves Chris,

42:42.661 --> 42:45.295
<i>so she was especially happy
that I was moving with him.</i>

42:47.165 --> 42:49.065
Oh, my God.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.633
<i>- It's a great opportunity
for us,</i>

42:50.635 --> 42:53.336
<i>and we're extremely excited
to start a future.</i>

42:53.338 --> 42:54.771
<i>- I'm so excited to have this</i>

42:54.773 --> 42:56.940
<i>new ninja warrior experience
with Chris,</i>

42:56.942 --> 42:58.841
because the couple who ninjas
together

42:58.843 --> 43:00.376
hits buzzers together.

43:04.115 --> 43:07.183
<i>- Chris will be running later,
but he's on the sideline,</i>

43:07.185 --> 43:11.087
<i>and so is Emeline.
She loves being here for Flex.</i>

43:11.089 --> 43:13.356
<i>Michelle Warnky and Allyssa
Beird also watching.</i>

43:13.358 --> 43:15.525
<i>Remember, only two women
are guaranteed</i>

43:15.527 --> 43:17.260
<i>to move on from this region.</i>

43:17.262 --> 43:19.796
<i>Flex is gonna need a good run
to stay ahead of those two.</i>

43:19.798 --> 43:22.632
[countdown clock beeping]

43:22.634 --> 43:24.767
<i>Flex finished the course
in qualifying,</i>

43:24.769 --> 43:26.202
<i>along with Allyssa Beird.</i>

43:26.204 --> 43:27.971
<i>The first time
we've had two women</i>

43:27.973 --> 43:30.373
<i>hit the buzzer in
a city qualifying round.</i>

43:30.375 --> 43:33.443
<i>- Yes, she was impressive
last year as a rookie.</i>

43:33.445 --> 43:34.744
<i>I think she's gonna go
even further here</i>

43:34.746 --> 43:38.381
<i>in her sophomore season.</i>

43:38.383 --> 43:39.916
<i>Well, the way
this night is going,</i>

43:39.918 --> 43:41.250
<i>it looks like
you'll have to get to</i>

43:41.252 --> 43:42.919
<i>at least the Nail Clipper</i>

43:42.921 --> 43:44.854
<i>and get there in a fast time</i>

43:44.856 --> 43:47.290
<i>if you want to get
to the national finals,</i>

43:47.292 --> 43:49.525
<i>but you can't overlook
the Rolling Log.</i>

43:49.527 --> 43:51.127
<i>- Keep it tight.
- Keep your core tight.</i>

43:51.129 --> 43:52.795
<i>Keep your core tight.</i>

43:52.797 --> 43:54.797
<i>- Locked in, tremendous power</i>

43:54.799 --> 43:56.399
<i>out of Flex on
the Rolling Log.</i>

43:56.401 --> 43:58.067
<i>- She's not playing around.</i>

43:58.069 --> 44:01.104
<i>- Labreck was a track star
at the University of Maine,</i>

44:01.106 --> 44:02.739
<i>still holds a lot
of school records there.</i>

44:02.741 --> 44:06.509
<i>Right now needs to sprint
across the Razor's Edge.</i>

44:06.511 --> 44:10.179
<i>- Look at the balance there.
- Ooh. Whoa, whoa.</i>

44:10.181 --> 44:12.248
<i>She ain't playing,
she ain't playing.</i>

44:12.250 --> 44:13.549
<i>- You know, the balance
obstacles can be</i>

44:13.551 --> 44:14.984
<i>such equalizers,
got to be a relief,</i>

44:14.986 --> 44:16.953
<i>and Flex now into
her wheelhouse,</i>

44:16.955 --> 44:20.490
<i>going on to
the Ring Jump here.</i>

44:20.492 --> 44:22.058
<i>What we saw her do
in qualifying,</i>

44:22.060 --> 44:24.594
<i>she did it as well as anyone,
male or female.</i>

44:24.596 --> 44:27.730
<i>What power, right up,
two moves there.</i>

44:27.732 --> 44:30.133
<i>- She ain't playing, Matt.
- She is so strong.</i>

44:30.135 --> 44:31.768
<i>- I'm telling you,
I've got a feeling</i>

44:31.770 --> 44:34.504
<i>she could be the first female
American Ninja Warrior.</i>

44:34.506 --> 44:36.305
<i>- Well, she was
a pentathlete at Maine,</i>

44:36.307 --> 44:39.242
<i>a very well-rounded
athlete, has good upper-</i>

44:39.244 --> 44:42.512
<i>and lower-body strength,
and she's through.</i>

44:42.514 --> 44:44.480
<i>The crowd all on their feet,</i>

44:44.482 --> 44:46.983
<i>eagerly watching Flex Labreck</i>

44:46.985 --> 44:49.385
<i>and now another
upper-body obstacle.</i>

44:49.387 --> 44:52.689
<i>It's the I-Beam Gap.
And by reaching this point,</i>

44:52.691 --> 44:54.957
<i>She's gone farther
than Annika Nieshalla</i>

44:54.959 --> 44:56.459
<i>and Tori Clement,</i>

44:56.461 --> 44:58.294
<i>so she's assured of being
in the top three</i>

44:58.296 --> 44:59.996
<i>among the women.</i>

44:59.998 --> 45:02.565
<i>Right now she's ahead of
Warnky's time to this point,</i>

45:02.567 --> 45:04.467
<i>with Allyssa Beird
still to come.</i>

45:04.469 --> 45:06.302
<i>- This is the tough spot
on the I-beam.</i>

45:06.304 --> 45:09.172
<i>You see how she wasted
no time, was smooth.</i>

45:09.174 --> 45:12.575
<i>You see how she just slid
there like a snake.</i>

45:12.577 --> 45:13.576
<i>- So strong.</i>

45:13.578 --> 45:15.712
[cheers and applause]

45:15.714 --> 45:17.080
<i>- Now she's just got
to shake, rattle,</i>

45:17.082 --> 45:19.749
<i>and roll on this transfer.</i>

45:19.751 --> 45:21.451
<i>- Nice.
- Locked in.</i>

45:21.453 --> 45:26.856
<i>And Flex Labreck continues
to roll here in Cleveland.</i>

45:26.858 --> 45:29.625
<i>- Watch your heels,
watch your heels.</i>

45:29.627 --> 45:32.261
<i>- Just a few more feet
and she can dismount.</i>

45:34.699 --> 45:37.366
Come on, she's got it.

45:37.368 --> 45:42.405
Time now for the Warped Wall
for Flex Labreck.

45:42.407 --> 45:46.275
- You're doing great.
- Great time, great time.

45:46.277 --> 45:48.745
- So far, she's ahead
of Warnky's pace.

45:48.747 --> 45:51.748
Got to get up this wall,
though.

45:51.750 --> 45:53.149
Look at that lean.

45:53.151 --> 45:55.585
- Ooh, look at that lean.
- Look at that track lean.

45:55.587 --> 45:59.188
- And boom, Flex Labreck on
the back half of the course.

45:59.190 --> 46:00.957
- She's showing it all off now.

46:00.959 --> 46:03.226
<i>- And right now, with her
time to this point,</i>

46:03.228 --> 46:05.461
<i>if she gets up
the Salmon Ladder,</i>

46:05.463 --> 46:08.097
<i>she'll move ahead of Warnky
and guarantee herself a spot</i>

46:08.099 --> 46:10.600
<i>in the national finals.</i>

46:10.602 --> 46:12.101
- Come on, Jesse.

46:12.103 --> 46:14.003
<i>- Well, she destroyed
the Salmon Ladder</i>

46:14.005 --> 46:15.972
<i>last year in Philadelphia.</i>

46:15.974 --> 46:17.573
<i>Can she do it again here?</i>

46:18.810 --> 46:22.812
<i>- All right.
- Going with that switch grip.</i>

46:22.814 --> 46:24.514
<i>- Good rhythm.</i>

46:24.516 --> 46:26.048
<i>- Smooth
- Right up it.</i>

46:26.050 --> 46:29.051
<i>Come on.
The power in Flex Labreck.</i>

46:29.053 --> 46:30.853
- Matt, she is
a Labreck house.

46:30.855 --> 46:32.321
Look how strong she is.

46:32.323 --> 46:35.858
- She's going back to Vegas
but now the Nail Clipper.

46:35.860 --> 46:37.293
Can she get through it?

46:37.295 --> 46:40.463
<i>Only Jamie Rahn
has survived this obstacle.</i>

46:40.465 --> 46:42.532
<i>- Watch her get through
Nail Clipper.</i>

46:42.534 --> 46:44.934
<i>- Makes it to
the second cylinder.</i>

46:44.936 --> 46:48.571
<i>- Look at this, reaching around.
- Watch her.</i>

46:48.573 --> 46:50.973
<i>- 5'7",
trying to use those arms.</i>

46:50.975 --> 46:53.743
<i>Oh, but looking fatigued!</i>

46:53.745 --> 46:56.746
<i>- Breathe, breathe, breathe,
Jesse. Breathe, Jesse.</i>

46:56.748 --> 46:58.614
<i>- Oh, my.
- I'm telling you.</i>

46:58.616 --> 47:02.819
<i>- Oh, my, makes it to
the third cylinder.</i>

47:02.821 --> 47:06.656
- Let's go!
<i>- Come on.</i>

47:06.658 --> 47:09.692
<i>She can do this.
Just one more.</i>

47:09.694 --> 47:11.460
<i>- Come on.
- Jesse Labreck.</i>

47:11.462 --> 47:13.629
<i>- Oh!
- No!</i>

47:15.200 --> 47:17.633
<i>- She made it
to the third cylinder.</i>

47:17.635 --> 47:19.936
<i>Looked like she might complete
the obstacle,</i>

47:19.938 --> 47:22.939
<i>but Jesse Labreck
comes up just short.</i>

47:22.941 --> 47:25.942
<i>But that definitely
deserves a kiss.</i>

47:25.944 --> 47:28.811
<i>- Watch her make the move
over to the third cylinder.</i>

47:28.813 --> 47:31.147
<i>She's just the second
to do that tonight.</i>

47:31.149 --> 47:32.882
<i>And look at her face.</i>

47:32.884 --> 47:36.385
<i>She gave it all she had, but
her grip finally gave out.</i>

47:36.387 --> 47:37.653
<i>- Let's go down to Kristine</i>

47:37.655 --> 47:39.222
<i>for the POM Post Run
Interview.</i>

47:39.224 --> 47:41.591
- Jesse, you made it all
the way to the Nail Clipper

47:41.593 --> 47:44.026
and very far
on the Nail Clipper.

47:44.028 --> 47:46.462
Explain to me what goes through
your mind as you're doing that.

47:46.464 --> 47:48.064
- I kept thinking about
how close I was,

47:48.066 --> 47:50.499
and I could just feel
my forearms giving out

47:50.501 --> 47:53.135
and my fingers giving out,
and I wanted it so bad,

47:53.137 --> 47:55.371
and there was nothing
I could do about it.

47:55.373 --> 47:57.273
- I know you and Emeline
don't get to see each other

47:57.275 --> 47:59.775
as much since you've moved now.

47:59.777 --> 48:02.178
How much did her presence
here push you on?

48:02.180 --> 48:04.247
- Oh, her presence pushes me
all the time.

48:04.249 --> 48:05.748
I can hear her cheering.

48:05.750 --> 48:07.683
I can hear her cheering
the whole time,

48:07.685 --> 48:10.086
<i>and it just makes me really
happy that she could come.</i>

48:10.088 --> 48:12.255
- Jesse, I am so excited
to tell you

48:12.257 --> 48:14.790
that you have officially
qualified for Las Vegas,

48:14.792 --> 48:17.660
so we're gonna see you back
there at the national finals.

48:17.662 --> 48:19.528
- Go, Jesse.

48:19.530 --> 48:21.530
- Congratulations,
go celebrate.

48:21.532 --> 48:24.734
Matt and Akbar, back to you.

48:24.736 --> 48:27.336
<i>- Well, there are so many
strong women here tonight;</i>

48:27.338 --> 48:31.140
<i>it's gonna be a real battle
for those final two spots.</i>

48:31.142 --> 48:33.776
<i>Allyssa Beird's run
coming up in a bit.</i>

48:33.778 --> 48:37.246
<i>Plus, we've seen
an engagement, a wedding,</i>

48:37.248 --> 48:39.448
<i>and his first-born child.</i>

48:39.450 --> 48:44.220
<i>Now Joe Moravsky's got
some other big news to share.</i>

48:44.222 --> 48:46.422
<i>The Weatherman's story
is coming up</i>

48:46.424 --> 48:48.357
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

48:50.527 --> 48:50.559
.

48:52.462 --> 48:54.063
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

48:54.065 --> 48:55.898
<i>in downtown Cleveland.</i>

48:55.900 --> 48:58.267
<i>While we were away,
two more competitors</i>

48:58.269 --> 49:01.170
<i>tried to earn their ticket
to the national finals.</i>

49:01.172 --> 49:03.272
<i>Connecticut's Samer Delgado</i>

49:03.274 --> 49:05.007
<i>got spun right out
of his shoes</i>

49:05.009 --> 49:06.409
<i>on the Rolling Log.</i>

49:06.411 --> 49:09.011
<i>- Don't forget your shoes.
- Tie your shoes.</i>

49:09.013 --> 49:11.047
<i>- But the acrobat bounced
back</i>

49:11.049 --> 49:12.682
<i>and made it
to the Nail Clipper,</i>

49:12.684 --> 49:14.483
<i>where he became
the 12th victim.</i>

49:14.485 --> 49:16.185
<i>- Ah!</i>

49:16.187 --> 49:19.021
<i>The Nail Clipper will
definitely cut you off.</i>

49:19.023 --> 49:21.791
<i>- Another rookie,
Matthew Ilgenfritz,</i>

49:21.793 --> 49:24.460
<i>couldn't make it up the
Warped Wall in qualifying,</i>

49:24.462 --> 49:27.063
<i>but he did tonight.
Got it.</i>

49:27.065 --> 49:28.831
- Quick learner.
<i>- The Pennsylvania</i>

49:28.833 --> 49:32.034
<i>construction worker
put together a strong run,</i>

49:32.036 --> 49:34.303
<i>and he became
the 13th competitor</i>

49:34.305 --> 49:35.671
<i>knocked out
by the Nail Clipper.</i>

49:35.673 --> 49:37.340
<i>both: Oh!</i>

49:37.342 --> 49:38.407
- Oh!

49:40.211 --> 49:42.945
<i>- And on the course right now
with a good run going</i>

49:42.947 --> 49:45.181
<i>is six-time ninja veteran
Chris DiGangi.</i>

49:45.183 --> 49:47.483
<i>He was just on
the sidelines minutes ago</i>

49:47.485 --> 49:50.386
<i>for his girlfriend's run,
Jesse "Flex" Labreck.</i>

49:50.388 --> 49:52.221
- Let's go, babe.

49:52.223 --> 49:53.923
<i>- We know Flex is moving on.</i>

49:53.925 --> 49:57.760
<i>DiGangi hasn't been to the
national finals in five years.</i>

49:57.762 --> 50:00.629
<i>He's finished just
outside the top 15,</i>

50:00.631 --> 50:02.832
<i>but training with Labreck
seems to have helped.</i>

50:02.834 --> 50:05.334
<i>He just needs to get up the
Salmon Ladder, and he is in.</i>

50:05.336 --> 50:09.171
<i>- And he fell on this
obstacle back in season five.</i>

50:09.173 --> 50:12.108
<i>That's the last time
he's made it this far.</i>

50:12.110 --> 50:15.678
<i>- Look at that, right up it.</i>

50:15.680 --> 50:17.213
<i>He's done it.
Now the Nail Clipper.</i>

50:17.215 --> 50:19.348
<i>Let's see if he can match
his girlfriend.</i>

50:19.350 --> 50:20.916
<i>- This is the pressure,
though, to do better</i>

50:20.918 --> 50:23.519
<i>than his girlfriend did,
Jesse, on this obstacle.</i>

50:23.521 --> 50:24.887
<i>We've seen a lot of
competitors</i>

50:24.889 --> 50:26.856
<i>go out on the second cylinder.</i>

50:26.858 --> 50:30.226
<i>- Well, you see how they
rotate. They'll lock in place.</i>

50:30.228 --> 50:33.662
<i>- Ooh, somebody really
studied Jesse's notes.</i>

50:33.664 --> 50:36.098
<i>- But now has to reach over
for that third one.</i>

50:36.100 --> 50:38.901
<i>This is where the arms
really start to hurt,</i>

50:38.903 --> 50:41.370
<i>but he gets it,
just like Flex.</i>

50:41.372 --> 50:42.638
<i>Oh!</i>

50:44.742 --> 50:48.077
<i>And DiGangi falls in
the same spot as Flex.</i>

50:48.079 --> 50:51.380
<i>They do everything together.</i>

50:51.382 --> 50:52.415
<i>- I want you to look
at these two</i>

50:52.417 --> 50:54.016
<i>right on top of each other,</i>

50:54.018 --> 50:56.285
<i>and you can see,
they're eerily similar.</i>

50:56.287 --> 50:58.554
<i>They both made it to that
third cylinder</i>

50:58.556 --> 51:00.156
<i>and reached around it.</i>

51:00.158 --> 51:04.160
<i>Jesse hung on a second longer,
but a good run for both.</i>

51:04.162 --> 51:06.262
<i>- And they're now standing by
with Kristine.</i>

51:06.264 --> 51:07.863
- Chris, your girlfriend
Jesse

51:07.865 --> 51:09.698
has already qualified
for Las Vegas.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.101
How much would it mean
to you to get back there?

51:12.103 --> 51:14.003
- Oh, it would mean so much
just to do it with her

51:14.005 --> 51:15.771
and to get back there
since season

51:15.773 --> 51:18.340
four would be...
it would mean a lot.

51:18.342 --> 51:20.276
- Jesse, what about you?
- How much would it mean to you

51:20.278 --> 51:22.278
to have you both
going to Las Vegas?

51:22.280 --> 51:23.846
Oh.

51:23.848 --> 51:26.015
- It got her.
- Why are you crying?

51:26.017 --> 51:28.384
- 'Cause I want him to make it.

51:28.386 --> 51:30.820
- If I told you
he's going to Vegas,

51:30.822 --> 51:32.088
would you stop crying?

51:32.090 --> 51:33.422
- No.

51:33.424 --> 51:34.790
- Well, he's going
to Las Vegas.

51:34.792 --> 51:37.960
You're both going together,
congratulations.

51:37.962 --> 51:39.962
Matt and Akbar, back to you.

51:39.964 --> 51:41.931
<i>- Well, congrats to those
two for making it</i>

51:41.933 --> 51:44.567
<i>to the national finals.</i>

51:44.569 --> 51:46.235
<i>Up next is former pro
volleyball player</i>

51:46.237 --> 51:47.970
<i>Mark Ribeiro.</i>

51:47.972 --> 51:49.305
<i>He lives in New York City,</i>

51:49.307 --> 51:51.807
<i>and his nickname
is Concrete Tarzan,</i>

51:51.809 --> 51:54.343
<i>but he's got a soft spot
for his two nieces.</i>

51:54.345 --> 51:56.912
- Yeah!

51:56.914 --> 51:59.648
<i>- My sister's name is Iris,
and she has two daughters</i>

51:59.650 --> 52:01.484
<i>that are challenged
with autism.</i>

52:01.486 --> 52:03.819
Their names are
Adrianna and Melia.

52:03.821 --> 52:05.821
<i>Adrianna and Melia
are challenged with,</i>

52:05.823 --> 52:07.556
<i>more than anything else,
communication.</i>

52:07.558 --> 52:10.259
- How does she feel?
- Sad.

52:10.261 --> 52:12.027
<i>- Adrianna is doing
a bit better.</i>

52:12.029 --> 52:13.929
<i>She can create sentences.</i>

52:13.931 --> 52:16.699
She can verbalize that
she's hungry, she's tired,

52:16.701 --> 52:18.901
she has to go to the bathroom,
things like that.

52:18.903 --> 52:20.402
<i>Melia, on the other hand,</i>

52:20.404 --> 52:22.238
<i>doesn't put together
sentences as well.</i>

52:22.240 --> 52:24.340
- And going to?
- School.

52:24.342 --> 52:26.475
- School.
- Yay.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.044
<i>- My sister Iris,
everything that she does,</i>

52:29.046 --> 52:30.880
she's always smiling and happy.

52:30.882 --> 52:35.251
<i>The drive which she has daily
to take care of these twins,</i>

52:35.253 --> 52:37.620
she still has a great
attitude about it.

52:37.622 --> 52:41.557
<i>- Ribeiro demolishes
the ascent.</i>

52:41.559 --> 52:44.059
<i>- And on the course,
that is the inspiration.</i>

52:44.061 --> 52:46.962
- Yes!
- I can go farther.

52:46.964 --> 52:49.832
I can keep pushing,
just like my sister.

52:53.171 --> 52:55.271
- Go, Tarzan!
<i>- There's his sister Iris</i>

52:55.273 --> 52:57.239
<i>holding one
of the twins, Adrianna,</i>

52:57.241 --> 52:59.875
<i>but the whole family is here
to watch this run tonight.</i>

52:59.877 --> 53:02.878
[countdown clock beeping]

53:02.880 --> 53:06.015
<i>- Ribeiro is a big guy now,
6'3",</i>

53:06.017 --> 53:07.683
<i>one of the taller
competitors tonight.</i>

53:07.685 --> 53:10.786
<i>- He started out as
a basketball player</i>

53:10.788 --> 53:12.288
<i>but then found volleyball,</i>

53:12.290 --> 53:14.190
<i>ended up becoming
a national champion</i>

53:14.192 --> 53:16.225
<i>at Springfield College.</i>

53:16.227 --> 53:18.561
<i>Explosive hops.</i>

53:18.563 --> 53:22.131
<i>He can use those long arms and
legs here on the Rolling Log.</i>

53:22.133 --> 53:24.099
<i>This is his first season
competing,</i>

53:24.101 --> 53:25.634
<i>not a lot of experience.</i>

53:32.543 --> 53:34.877
<i>- Oh, that almost whipped him
off the log.</i>

53:34.879 --> 53:38.180
<i>- This Rolling Log
being real vicious tonight.</i>

53:38.182 --> 53:39.949
- All day!

53:39.951 --> 53:41.684
<i>- If he wants to move on,</i>

53:41.686 --> 53:43.352
<i>Ribeiro's gonna have to at
least get to the Nail Clipper,</i>

53:43.354 --> 53:45.788
<i>but up next,
the Razor's Edge.</i>

53:47.592 --> 53:50.626
<i>Ribeiro, with long
strides, no problem.</i>

53:50.628 --> 53:52.127
[cheers and applause]

53:52.129 --> 53:54.697
<i>- We got a full moon.
- Let the beast come out.</i>

53:54.699 --> 53:56.765
<i>- Ribeiro played
pro volleyball in Europe</i>

53:56.767 --> 53:59.501
<i>and can use some big hops
here on the Ring Jump.</i>

54:01.739 --> 54:04.006
<i>- Listen to the sound
on Ring Jump.</i>

54:04.008 --> 54:06.075
<i>- An unusual
pull-up technique.</i>

54:06.077 --> 54:08.744
<i>He's got the wingspan
to just reach over.</i>

54:08.746 --> 54:10.246
<i>Seems to be wasting a lot
of energy.</i>

54:10.248 --> 54:12.047
<i>Now he gets it.</i>

54:12.049 --> 54:16.051
<i>- Yeah, efficiency, strategy,
understanding the obstacle,</i>

54:16.053 --> 54:17.953
<i>especially in your
rookie year.</i>

54:17.955 --> 54:20.689
<i>- Making quick work
of these 8-inch pegs,</i>

54:20.691 --> 54:22.558
<i>going for the dismount.</i>

54:22.560 --> 54:26.729
<i>Just barely makes it.</i>

54:26.731 --> 54:31.634
<i>- Oh, he's taking off
the shirt. Tight jean shorts.</i>

54:31.636 --> 54:33.869
- Uncle Mark.
- [inaudible]

54:33.871 --> 54:35.304
Uncle Mark!

54:35.306 --> 54:38.240
<i>- His two nieces,
Adrianna and Melia,</i>

54:38.242 --> 54:39.775
<i>really responding
to Uncle Mark,</i>

54:39.777 --> 54:42.578
<i>but now it's the I-Beam Gap.</i>

54:42.580 --> 54:44.013
<i>This is where his run
ended in qualifying.</i>

54:44.015 --> 54:48.450
<i>Could not pull himself up
the first beam.</i>

54:48.452 --> 54:51.287
<i>His nickname is the Concrete
Tarzan, loves to climb, jump,</i>

54:51.289 --> 54:53.422
<i>and swing on anything.</i>

54:53.424 --> 54:55.457
<i>Really is... you can see that
lower body dropping down.</i>

54:55.459 --> 54:56.792
<i>That's gonna sap
some more energy.</i>

54:56.794 --> 54:58.294
<i>- We saw that before
in qualifying.</i>

54:58.296 --> 54:59.862
<i>He did that twice.</i>

54:59.864 --> 55:01.864
<i>- This is a real challenge
here.</i>

55:01.866 --> 55:04.099
<i>What kind of vise grip
strength can he get,</i>

55:04.101 --> 55:05.601
<i>and he is struggling here.</i>

55:05.603 --> 55:06.902
<i>- All right, let's see if he</i>

55:06.904 --> 55:09.171
<i>learned anything
since qualifying.</i>

55:09.173 --> 55:10.606
<i>- Part of it looks like
the flexibility,</i>

55:10.608 --> 55:12.174
<i>but he is finding a way.</i>

55:12.176 --> 55:14.743
<i>- He is fighting.
- He's being scrappy.</i>

55:14.745 --> 55:19.581
<i>I see you, Concrete Tarzan.</i>

55:19.583 --> 55:23.652
<i>- Now with his height, he may
be able to just step across.</i>

55:23.654 --> 55:24.987
- Let's go.
- There you go.

55:24.989 --> 55:26.422
<i>- There we go.
- He's 6'3",</i>

55:26.424 --> 55:28.957
<i>so he can cheat this here.</i>

55:28.959 --> 55:30.893
<i>Real vulnerable transition.
Look at the core.</i>

55:30.895 --> 55:32.461
<i>Engage the core
so you don't fall.</i>

55:32.463 --> 55:35.130
<i>- There he goes.
- All right, all right.</i>

55:35.132 --> 55:37.866
<i>Showing really good ankle
mobility and flexibility.</i>

55:37.868 --> 55:40.169
<i>- You got to use that
lower body and lock in.</i>

55:40.171 --> 55:43.172
- All right. Watch out.

55:43.174 --> 55:45.674
- That foot is not on.
- Now, watch out, watch out.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.910
Engage the heel and watch out
for the little gap.

55:47.912 --> 55:49.645
- His feet are sliding off.

55:49.647 --> 55:51.246
I think the bigger guy's having
trouble with that flexibility,

55:51.248 --> 55:52.581
really pincering.

55:52.583 --> 55:53.615
- He looked like he was
about to peel off.

55:53.617 --> 55:55.084
- He's going for the dismount.

55:55.086 --> 55:58.754
Whoa!

55:58.756 --> 56:00.923
<i>- Inches away.</i>

56:00.925 --> 56:04.093
- I could feel it and see it.
- It was right there.

56:04.095 --> 56:06.695
- It's all right.
- Yeah.

56:06.697 --> 56:08.897
<i>- Look at how close
he was.</i>

56:08.899 --> 56:10.265
<i>That landing pad is right</i>

56:10.267 --> 56:12.735
<i>in front of him,
but watch his fingers.</i>

56:12.737 --> 56:14.837
<i>He's trying to wind up
for the dismount,</i>

56:14.839 --> 56:17.940
<i>and they just peel right off.</i>

56:17.942 --> 56:19.842
<i>- We've got some big names
still to come here</i>

56:19.844 --> 56:21.276
<i>in Cleveland,</i>

56:21.278 --> 56:24.113
<i>including the Phoenix,
Najee Richardson.</i>

56:24.115 --> 56:26.415
<i>His run's just ahead.</i>

56:26.417 --> 56:29.518
<i>But up next, she rules
in the classroom...</i>

56:29.520 --> 56:31.153
[together]
Go, Ms. Beird.

56:31.155 --> 56:33.389
<i>- And on the course.</i>

56:33.391 --> 56:35.290
<i>Yes!</i>

56:35.292 --> 56:38.794
<i>Allyssa Beird runs next
on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

56:43.066 --> 56:43.098
.

56:45.101 --> 56:47.002
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

56:47.004 --> 56:49.638
<i>coming to you
from Cleveland, Ohio.</i>

56:49.640 --> 56:51.140
<i>Our coverage tonight is
powered</i>

56:51.142 --> 56:54.510
<i>in part by Crazy Healthy
POM Wonderful.</i>

56:54.512 --> 56:57.312
<i>Up next, it's the last of
our women competitors tonight.</i>

56:57.314 --> 56:59.882
<i>From Marlborough,
Massachusetts,</i>

56:59.884 --> 57:02.618
<i>this is fifth grade teacher
Allyssa Beird.</i>

57:02.620 --> 57:04.653
<i>She had a huge run
in qualifying,</i>

57:04.655 --> 57:07.256
<i>making it up the Warped Wall
to hit the buzzer,</i>

57:07.258 --> 57:10.058
<i>and she's become quite
a celebrity to her students.</i>

57:13.097 --> 57:16.465
Yes!
Allyssa Beird.

57:16.467 --> 57:19.168
Yes!

57:19.170 --> 57:21.503
<i>- This was the first buzzer
I have ever hit</i>

57:21.505 --> 57:23.005
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

57:23.007 --> 57:25.507
and that feels
absolutely amazing.

57:25.509 --> 57:27.810
- Here you go. You ready?

57:27.812 --> 57:29.812
- Wow!
- Yes.

57:29.814 --> 57:33.282
<i>An apple for the teacher,
and she earned it.</i>

57:34.952 --> 57:36.585
- What you guys are going
to do is, you're going to be

57:36.587 --> 57:38.854
in groups of two or three,

57:38.856 --> 57:42.191
and you are going to be doing
some ninja frog flipping.

57:42.193 --> 57:43.592
So you have your
note card frogs.

57:43.594 --> 57:45.627
All you do is, you push
the back of it here

57:45.629 --> 57:47.896
and do a flip forward.

57:47.898 --> 57:51.166
I teach fifth grade in
Middleborough, Massachusetts.

57:51.168 --> 57:52.601
There you go.
That was a good one.

57:52.603 --> 57:54.169
<i>It's been pretty cool
going back to work</i>

57:54.171 --> 57:56.705
<i>and having kids in the hall
kind of whisper and wave</i>

57:56.707 --> 57:58.073
<i>and say, "Hi, Ms. Beird.</i>

57:58.075 --> 58:00.476
<i>You're on 'American
Ninja Warrior.'"</i>

58:00.478 --> 58:01.777
I'm not used to being
in the spotlight.

58:01.779 --> 58:04.680
[together]
Go, Ms. Beird! Go, Ms. Beird!

58:04.682 --> 58:07.649
- Working a day job and also
needing a lot of time

58:07.651 --> 58:09.184
to train for ninja,

58:09.186 --> 58:13.055
it's a difficult amount
of stuff to balance.

58:13.057 --> 58:15.190
<i>I drive an hour
to work every day,</i>

58:15.192 --> 58:17.659
<i>and I work 12, 13 hours.</i>

58:17.661 --> 58:18.927
Walk me through
the story a little bit.

58:18.929 --> 58:20.229
So Jack is the main character.

58:20.231 --> 58:21.463
- Yeah.
- Okay, so how is this

58:21.465 --> 58:23.198
starting out?

58:23.200 --> 58:25.834
<i>I head to a gym that's an hour
in a different direction,</i>

58:25.836 --> 58:30.572
train for a couple of hours...

58:30.574 --> 58:33.575
<i>and then drive another
45 minutes home.</i>

58:33.577 --> 58:35.110
So it's a lot to balance.

58:36.514 --> 58:37.880
<i>- Wow!</i>

58:37.882 --> 58:40.382
<i>- Can your fifth grade
teacher do this?</i>

58:40.384 --> 58:44.686
<i>- The next step in my ninja
journey is to crush finals</i>

58:44.688 --> 58:47.422
and bring myself to Vegas
and hit more buzzers there.

58:50.895 --> 58:53.061
<i>- There's her boyfriend,
James "The Beast" McGrath.</i>

58:53.063 --> 58:54.630
<i>He'll run later.</i>

58:54.632 --> 58:57.533
<i>Allyssa's parents and
family are also here,</i>

58:57.535 --> 58:59.701
<i>and watching closely
will be Michelle Warnky.</i>

58:59.703 --> 59:01.904
<i>She's in second place
among the women,</i>

59:01.906 --> 59:04.473
<i>but could be edged out
if Beird has a good run.</i>

59:04.475 --> 59:06.241
[countdown clock beeping]

59:06.243 --> 59:07.676
<i>- All right, it's getting hot
in here, Matt.</i>

59:07.678 --> 59:09.711
<i>This is a real battle
among these women,</i>

59:09.713 --> 59:12.948
<i>Beird, Warnky, and Labreck
fighting for those two spots.</i>

59:12.950 --> 59:15.050
<i>- Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

59:15.052 --> 59:17.352
<i>Nuh-uh, not my teacher.</i>

59:17.354 --> 59:19.254
<i>My teacher's not
going out like that.</i>

59:19.256 --> 59:20.856
<i>- Well, we see it.</i>

59:20.858 --> 59:22.391
<i>You're gonna have a stumble
in Ninja Warrior.</i>

59:22.393 --> 59:25.327
<i>You've just got to be able
to respond and survive,</i>

59:25.329 --> 59:27.963
<i>and Beird no longer smiling.</i>

59:27.965 --> 59:29.531
<i>She is focused now.</i>

59:29.533 --> 59:32.668
<i>It can end so quickly
here on Ninja Warrior.</i>

59:32.670 --> 59:36.471
<i>- Locked down, ready to go.
- 5'4", 125.</i>

59:36.473 --> 59:39.274
<i>- All right, hold on.
- Keep it tight, keep it tight.</i>

59:39.276 --> 59:42.911
<i>- Wow, what a ride.
- That spin is just wicked.</i>

59:42.913 --> 59:45.781
<i>- It's like the merry-go-round
at recess.</i>

59:45.783 --> 59:48.183
<i>Ms. Beird, though,
she's through,</i>

59:48.185 --> 59:51.753
<i>climbing up slowly to
take on the Razor's Edge.</i>

59:51.755 --> 59:55.057
<i>Trying to line it up,
but you can see,</i>

59:55.059 --> 59:57.059
<i>she's got a little blood
on that knee,</i>

59:57.061 --> 59:58.827
<i>cut it on the Floating Steps.</i>

59:58.829 --> 01:00:00.295
<i>- That's all right,
a little blood.</i>

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:02.097
<i>Ninjas like
a little bit of blood.</i>

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:04.366
- Keep it down a little bit.
- Come on back down.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.172
<i>- And she's through.
- I don't know too many</i>

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:11.673
<i>fifth grade teachers
who can do that.</i>

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:14.042
<i>- [inaudible].
- Jesse Labreck, she's already</i>

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:15.777
<i>punched her ticket,</i>

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.747
<i>but Michelle Warnky, even
after that great run earlier,</i>

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:22.084
<i>is in jeopardy of not making
the national finals.</i>

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:24.052
<i>That's how competitive
these women are.</i>

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:26.221
<i>Beird now starting
the Ring Jump.</i>

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:27.422
<i>If she gets to the
Nail Clipper</i>

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:30.592
<i>in less than Warnky's 6:42,</i>

01:00:30.594 --> 01:00:33.929
<i>she'll lock up
that second spot.</i>

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:37.566
<i>- She's using that
backward technique.</i>

01:00:37.568 --> 01:00:38.867
<i>- Good power.</i>

01:00:38.869 --> 01:00:42.704
<i>Oh. Another close call
for Beird.</i>

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:44.539
<i>She's been flirting
with disaster in this run</i>

01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:46.141
<i>but still alive.</i>

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:48.010
<i>- Well, this is
big-time pressure.</i>

01:00:48.012 --> 01:00:50.212
<i>She had an amazing run
in qualifying,</i>

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:52.114
<i>but if she doesn't
deliver tonight,</i>

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:54.883
<i>her season could be over.</i>

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:58.754
<i>- A lot of extra swings here.</i>

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:00.088
- There you go.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.491
You're locked in now.
Let's go!

01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:04.926
<i>- Just needs the dismount.</i>

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:06.862
<i>- She's swinging
side to side.</i>

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:08.063
<i>She's all over the place now.</i>

01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:09.865
<i>She's got to get
north and south.</i>

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:12.434
<i>Good, good.</i>

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:14.736
<i>- A shaky run so far
for Beird.</i>

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:16.672
<i>Now has
to take on the I-Beam Gap,</i>

01:01:16.674 --> 01:01:19.408
<i>and it's very easy
to make a slipup here.</i>

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:21.143
<i>- Matt, this is like geometry.</i>

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:22.778
<i>She got through this
in qualifying.</i>

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.513
<i>She knows how to do it.</i>

01:01:24.515 --> 01:01:27.916
<i>- You can see, at just 5'4",
that 2-foot gap there,</i>

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.986
<i>that is a big stretch,
but she's through it.</i>

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:32.854
<i>Can she make the ascent
once again?</i>

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:35.691
<i>- Now come on up.
- Come on up, come on up.</i>

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:37.626
<i>- What power
out of Allyssa Beird.</i>

01:01:37.628 --> 01:01:40.562
<i>- Man.
- Remarkable strength</i>

01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:43.498
<i>out of the teacher.</i>

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.268
<i>But now this jump
to the other side.</i>

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.739
<i>- Yes!
- Whoo!</i>

01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:53.341
<i>- Well, it's just her second
year of ninja competition,</i>

01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:56.845
<i>and she's established herself
as one of the top women.</i>

01:01:56.847 --> 01:02:00.415
<i>Teachers everywhere got
to be proud of Allyssa Beird.</i>

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:04.753
<i>And she's through.</i>

01:02:04.755 --> 01:02:08.423
Now Beird takes on
the Warped Wall,

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:11.126
and you got to feel
for Michelle Warnky,

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:12.961
made it to the eighth obstacle.

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:15.564
Only a few women
have ever made it further.

01:02:15.566 --> 01:02:16.798
It may not be good enough,
because

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.569
Beird's time is faster
to this point.

01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:22.971
- Beat that wall,
beat that wall.

01:02:22.973 --> 01:02:25.340
- First has to make it up
the wall.

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:27.109
- You got this!
- There's the lean.

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:29.845
Looks like Flex.

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:31.246
- Nice.
- Got it.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.515
- Nice.
- Ms. Beird

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:35.984
on the back half of the course.

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:39.121
Oh, my.

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:41.022
Well, here we go.

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:43.959
<i>At this point, if she gets to
the top of the Salmon Ladder</i>

01:02:43.961 --> 01:02:47.062
<i>faster than 6:42,</i>

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:49.397
<i>she will edge out
Michelle Warnky,</i>

01:02:49.399 --> 01:02:52.100
<i>and she will be going
to Las Vegas.</i>

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:54.336
<i>- That's a lot of pressure.
- That's a lot of pressure,</i>

01:02:54.338 --> 01:02:56.438
<i>and you know that's in
the back of her head too.</i>

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.240
- Take a breather,
take a breather.

01:02:58.242 --> 01:02:59.674
<i>- Her boyfriend James McGrath</i>

01:02:59.676 --> 01:03:02.110
<i>offering some advice.</i>

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:03.512
<i>- She's got to be
conscious of time.</i>

01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:06.047
<i>- She's gonna go
right into this.</i>

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:08.116
<i>- All right, four rungs,
don't get hung.</i>

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:09.451
<i>And she's in.</i>

01:03:13.524 --> 01:03:15.624
<i>- Ooh.
- Really kipping that body.</i>

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:17.092
- Yeah, she's doing everything.

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:18.960
She can't just rely
on the upper body.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.495
She's using the swing.

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:24.699
- Okay, but she still has
to reach out, and she's got it.

01:03:24.701 --> 01:03:28.036
<i>Allyssa Beird, the fifth grade
teacher's going to Vegas,</i>

01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:30.939
<i>but means Warnky
will not be moving on.</i>

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:34.476
<i>But now how far can
Allyssa Beird go?</i>

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:37.179
<i>Flex Labreck
almost got through this.</i>

01:03:37.181 --> 01:03:39.848
<i>- Oh, but she's struggling.</i>

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:40.949
<i>She's fighting it.</i>

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:42.584
<i>- Oh!
- No!</i>

01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:45.187
<i>- Splashes down,
but no matter.</i>

01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:47.722
<i>Allyssa Beird did
what she had to do.</i>

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:49.424
- Great job, Allyssa!

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:52.060
<i>- Give her an apple, Akbar.
- She passed the test.</i>

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:53.395
<i>- Yeah, she did.</i>

01:03:53.397 --> 01:03:55.096
<i>And she also gave us
a scare early</i>

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:56.832
<i>when she stumbled
on the steps,</i>

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.934
<i>but she came through
when it counted.</i>

01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:01.636
<i>She finished the Salmon
Ladder to secure her spot</i>

01:04:01.638 --> 01:04:03.305
<i>in the national finals.</i>

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.173
<i>Then, like so many others,</i>

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:08.677
<i>she couldn't get a grip
on the Nail Clipper.</i>

01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:15.250
<i>- And Allyssa Beird
celebrating with Flex Labreck.</i>

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:17.419
<i>This was a loaded field
of women in Cleveland,</i>

01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:22.023
<i>and those two are
the ones moving on.</i>

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.992
<i>Well, we want another
finisher tonight,</i>

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:26.094
<i>and if anyone can do it,
it's this man,</i>

01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:28.997
<i>five-time ninja veteran,
Joe Moravsky.</i>

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:31.666
<i>The Weatherman almost
always hits the buzzer,</i>

01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:35.370
<i>and his run's coming up
on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.575
<i>- Welcome back to downtown
Cleveland.</i>

01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:42.210
.
<i>While we were away,</i>

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:45.447
<i>two more athletes got
their chance on the course.</i>

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:48.083
<i>Rookie Kevin Weng made it
to the city finals</i>

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:50.285
<i>after less than a year
of training.</i>

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:52.621
<i>Mom and dad so proud
of their son.</i>

01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:55.257
<i>But the IT consultant
went offline</i>

01:04:55.259 --> 01:04:57.425
<i>when he fell at Razor's Edge.</i>

01:04:57.427 --> 01:04:59.160
<i>Wow!</i>

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:02.664
<i>5'6" Mike Meyers managed to
pull off the splits</i>

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:04.332
<i>on the I-Beam Gap.</i>

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:06.301
<i>- Wow!
- Showing off that flexibility.</i>

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:09.804
<i>- But the three-time veteran,
nicknamed the Course Killer,</i>

01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:12.307
<i>became the 16th victim
of the Nail Clipper.</i>

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:14.709
<i>- I think he's gonna get it.
- Oh!</i>

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:17.479
<i>- But he clicked his heels
because his fast time</i>

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:19.948
<i>guaranteed him
a spot in the top 15.</i>

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:23.151
<i>- He's going to Vegas.
- On the course right now</i>

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:25.687
<i>we've got some real drama.</i>

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:28.924
<i>This is seven-time veteran
James "The Beast" McGrath,</i>

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:32.928
<i>but right now he is not
acting like the Beast.</i>

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:34.896
<i>And you can see him
just collapse there.</i>

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:37.232
<i>He's been this way
through the entire run.</i>

01:05:37.234 --> 01:05:39.467
<i>- He's coming off
major shoulder surgery</i>

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:41.102
<i>earlier this year</i>

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.338
<i>and has not been able to train
the way he would like.</i>

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.807
<i>He just doesn't have
any stamina right now.</i>

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:48.276
<i>- There's his girlfriend,
who ran just minutes ago.</i>

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:49.611
<i>And she is looking concerned.</i>

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.346
<i>Well, McGrath now up,</i>

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:53.548
<i>gonna start
the I-Beam Gap.</i>

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:57.419
<i>- He's moving slow.</i>

01:05:57.421 --> 01:05:58.820
<i>- But here's the situation.</i>

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:00.522
<i>With only
a few runners left,</i>

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:03.325
<i>and if McGrath wants to be
in the top 15 and move on,</i>

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:05.660
<i>he needs to at least
finish the Salmon Ladder</i>

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:08.029
<i>in under five minutes.</i>

01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:09.064
<i>- Well, if that's the case,</i>

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:10.398
<i>he needs to pick it up here.</i>

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.268
<i>He's got to get
up this first beam.</i>

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:17.272
<i>All right, look up, stand up,
and don't ever give up.</i>

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:18.606
<i>All right, he's standing up.</i>

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:20.608
- Stretch it out.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.043
<i>- He's 6'2".</i>

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:24.713
<i>He can just step across
this gap.</i>

01:06:24.715 --> 01:06:26.781
<i>Normally he just
attacks the course,</i>

01:06:26.783 --> 01:06:29.985
<i>but tonight looking tentative.</i>

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:32.721
<i>But across safely.
He survives.</i>

01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:34.289
- And the clock keeps
tick-tick-ticking.

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:35.457
- Keep in mind,

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:37.559
this is one of
the all-time greats,

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:40.362
has made it to the national
finals six years in a row,

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:43.732
but tonight not looking
like himself.

01:06:43.734 --> 01:06:49.237
- And look at him.
- He can barely dismount.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:51.940
- And now just collapses again.

01:06:51.942 --> 01:06:54.609
Well, that shoulder injury
really set him back.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:56.211
He wasn't sure he'd even
be able to compete this year,

01:06:56.213 --> 01:07:00.148
and you can see,
the beast is not 100%.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:02.217
<i>Allyssa Beird has to be
worried.</i>

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:04.753
<i>She may be going
to Vegas alone.</i>

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:06.788
<i>Now he's getting up.</i>

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:09.391
<i>Keep in mind, the clock
continues to tick.</i>

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:12.027
- You're all right, James.
- You're all right. You're good.

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:13.628
- This is the guy
we call the Beast.

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:16.765
I've never seen him looking
this vulnerable on the course

01:07:16.767 --> 01:07:19.734
and yet, right up
the Warped Wall.

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:21.436
He is still the Beast.

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:23.204
- Oh, my goodness.
- He looks like he's sick.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:24.873
Yo, James.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:28.109
Yo, James, you feeling a
little sick, a little nauseous?

01:07:28.111 --> 01:07:29.477
- Just tired.
- You're tired?

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:31.546
- I'm just tired.
- Okay.

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.648
Well, you got 40 seconds.
You better get going.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:34.983
- You better get up
that Salmon Ladder, bro.

01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:36.384
The clock's ticking.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:39.521
- You can do it, James.
- Come on, all you got.

01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:41.923
- Well, everyone here
cheering him on,

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:43.792
<i>but he's not gonna make it up
the Salmon Ladder</i>

01:07:43.794 --> 01:07:45.560
<i>in under five minutes,</i>

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.063
<i>which means he'll have to
complete the next obstacle,</i>

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:51.666
<i>the Nail Clipper, which only
Jamie Rahn has done tonight.</i>

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:53.802
- All you got, James.
- Come on.

01:07:53.804 --> 01:07:56.237
<i>- Well, it's definitely tough
to stay in peak condition</i>

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:57.906
<i>when you're coming off
surgery.</i>

01:07:57.908 --> 01:08:00.608
<i>It is gonna be tough to get
through the Salmon Ladder</i>

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:02.777
<i>and the Nail Clipper.</i>

01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:04.512
<i>Oh, okay.
Oh, oh.</i>

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:06.514
<i>- And he just destroyed
the Salmon Ladder,</i>

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:09.451
<i>but now he's put himself
in a tough position, Akbar.</i>

01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:12.320
<i>- Okay, but you know what,
some athletes compete better</i>

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:14.189
<i>when their back
is against the wall,</i>

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:17.125
<i>and James McGrath
might just be that guy.</i>

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:18.693
<i>- Well, he's 6'2",</i>

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:22.397
<i>using that long wingspan
here on the Nail Clipper.</i>

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:25.033
<i>- Okay, he's got it, Matt.
- Here's the veteran.</i>

01:08:25.035 --> 01:08:27.868
- Come on.
- Lock in. Lock it in.

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:29.437
<i>- And look at this.</i>

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:33.073
<i>We thought he was dead,
but look at James McGrath.</i>

01:08:33.076 --> 01:08:35.944
<i>- Look at the confidence.
- Locking it in.</i>

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:38.779
<i>- He ain't playing.</i>

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:41.182
<i>Oh, boy.
The Beast.</i>

01:08:41.184 --> 01:08:45.453
<i>The Beast wants to join
his beauty in Las Vegas.</i>

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:48.089
<i>- Only the second person
to make it this far.</i>

01:08:48.091 --> 01:08:49.890
<i>He's almost got it.</i>

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:51.459
<i>Got to get the dismount.</i>

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.728
<i>- He's turning around.</i>

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:57.999
Oh, no, no!
Oh, my goodness.

01:08:58.001 --> 01:09:04.404
<i>- James McGrath,
the Beast splashes down.</i>

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:07.108
<i>A word of support from his
old roommate Drew Drechsel.</i>

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:08.776
<i>Well, what a run.</i>

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:12.346
<i>And his entire season,
the training, the surgery,</i>

01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:14.916
<i>all of it came down
to just a few inches.</i>

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:17.417
<i>Two inches more
on that dismount</i>

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.621
<i>and he'd be going
to the national finals.</i>

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.956
<i>Instead, his season is done,</i>

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:24.259
<i>and Allyssa Beird
is going to Vegas alone.</i>

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:26.261
<i>- It seemed as if he caught
a second wind</i>

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:29.330
<i>and handled these cylinders
as well as anyone tonight.</i>

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:32.332
<i>But look at that face
as he goes for the dismount.</i>

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.868
<i>He had to do a 180 in midair,</i>

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:37.272
<i>and his feet just missed
the landing pad,</i>

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:40.742
<i>and he can't hang on.
So close.</i>

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:44.812
- Oh, man.

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:47.782
I just...

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:50.350
wasn't strong enough.

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:52.120
<i>- Well, we're getting
near the end,</i>

01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:54.154
<i>and we need another finisher.</i>

01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:56.191
<i>Can the Phoenix,
Najee Richardson,</i>

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:57.358
<i>rise to the occasion?</i>

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.693
<i>We'll see his run</i>

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:01.362
<i>when "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:02.964
.

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:07.869
<i>- Welcome back to
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:10.138
<i>Minutes ago, two more
athletes got their shot</i>

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.840
<i>at this Cleveland
city finals course.</i>

01:10:12.842 --> 01:10:14.242
- [shouts]

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:16.177
<i>- Daniel Arnold,
younger brother</i>

01:10:16.179 --> 01:10:18.213
<i>of ninja veteran Brian Arnold,</i>

01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:20.381
<i>was a surprise
in his rookie season.</i>

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.483
<i>- Daniel's trying to make
his own name out here.</i>

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:24.252
<i>- The Ohio father of four
made it</i>

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:26.120
<i>to the back half of
the course,</i>

01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:29.157
<i>then became the 18th victim
of the Nail Clipper.</i>

01:10:29.159 --> 01:10:31.526
<i>- Oh!
- Wow.</i>

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:34.128
<i>- Right behind him,
firefighter Mike Bernardo</i>

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:36.731
<i>became the 19th competitor
to be taken out.</i>

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:39.334
<i>- Oh!
- But the firefighter's time</i>

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:43.438
<i>was fast enough to guarantee
a spot in the national finals.</i>

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.806
- You are going back
to Las Vegas.

01:10:44.808 --> 01:10:46.040
- Wow!

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:48.676
[cheers and applause]

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:50.712
<i>- Up next, one of
the breakout stars</i>

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:52.046
<i>from last season.</i>

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:53.581
<i>It's the Phoenix,</i>

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:56.484
<i>Philadelphia's 26-year-old
Najee Richardson.</i>

01:10:56.486 --> 01:10:58.786
<i>He was once a top-level
gymnast</i>

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:01.389
<i>but he saw his Olympic dreams
cut short.</i>

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:03.391
<i>Now he's trying
to inspire others</i>

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:05.293
<i>who've faced disappointment.</i>

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:13.901
- I was a former elite-level
athlete in gymnastics,

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:15.703
<i>and that got cut short for me</i>

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:17.805
<i>when I suffered my knee
injury.</i>

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:20.908
I had to retire from the sport
before I was ready to retire.

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:23.444
<i>After my career in gymnastics
ended,</i>

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:24.979
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:27.215
<i>I had no idea
where I was going.</i>

01:11:27.217 --> 01:11:28.983
<i>I didn't know
what my identity was,</i>

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:30.985
and then I found
"American Ninja Warrior."

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:35.890
<i>- Yes, he's got it.</i>

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:38.126
- Yeah!

01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:42.230
And then I was kind of reborn.

01:11:42.232 --> 01:11:46.267
Ninja warrior has really
given me stability in my life,

01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:47.435
<i>and it changed my life
for the better</i>

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:49.504
<i>just because of
the inspiration</i>

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:51.939
<i>and the message that
I've been able to pass on</i>

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:54.242
<i>just to my students
and people of all ages.</i>

01:11:54.244 --> 01:11:55.910
<i>No matter what they're
going through in their life,</i>

01:11:55.912 --> 01:11:57.512
<i>no matter what they've been
through in their life,</i>

01:11:57.514 --> 01:12:01.282
no matter how far
they've fallen, they can rise.

01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:03.651
<i>- Let's see him fly,
Phoenix, fly.</i>

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:04.686
<i>- When one door closes,</i>

01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:06.254
<i>another door can open.</i>

01:12:06.256 --> 01:12:07.822
<i>You just have to be willing
to go through it.</i>

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:10.491
It can be the beginning
of an amazing new journey.

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:15.630
<i>- Najee Richardson destroyed
this qualifying course.</i>

01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:17.465
- And that's what ninja's
done for me.

01:12:20.804 --> 01:12:24.005
<i>- Najee's got his girlfriend
McKenzie on the sidelines,</i>

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:25.873
<i>along with his buddy
Drew Drechsel.</i>

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.608
<i>Drew and Najee bonded after</i>

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:30.411
<i>competing in our all-star
skills special last year.</i>

01:12:30.413 --> 01:12:32.013
[countdown clock beeping]

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:34.082
<i>Najee's story is similar
to Olympian Jonathan Horton.</i>

01:12:34.084 --> 01:12:35.783
<i>Both were elite gymnasts,</i>

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:38.753
<i>now bringing those skills
to "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:12:38.755 --> 01:12:41.422
<i>Najee's quickly through,
headed to the Rolling Log.</i>

01:12:41.424 --> 01:12:42.924
<i>Over the years,
we've seen a lot</i>

01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:44.759
<i>of great athletes
in other sports</i>

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:46.260
<i>come try Ninja Warrior</i>

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:48.396
<i>to continue
their athletic careers.</i>

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:51.299
<i>- Ooh, watch out
for Rolling Log.</i>

01:12:51.301 --> 01:12:53.034
<i>- Good grip here.</i>

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:56.537
<i>Some violent spins on the log,</i>

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.806
<i>but he survives.</i>

01:13:00.243 --> 01:13:02.877
<i>Now stepping up to take on
Razor's Edge,</i>

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:05.046
<i>and he needs to be
conscious of the time.</i>

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:06.614
<i>He'll need to get
to the Nail Clipper</i>

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:09.650
<i>in under five minutes
to be safe.</i>

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:11.452
<i>- Ooh, that boy is smooth.</i>

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:14.255
<i>- No problem.
- On now to the Ring Jump.</i>

01:13:14.257 --> 01:13:17.492
- Just hands.
- Relax your arms.

01:13:17.494 --> 01:13:18.826
<i>- We've seen his power,</i>

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:20.495
<i>tremendous upper-body
strength.</i>

01:13:20.497 --> 01:13:23.231
<i>As a gymnast, this should be
in his wheelhouse.</i>

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:24.565
<i>Oh.</i>

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.134
<i>- Just one jump,
that's all he needs.</i>

01:13:26.136 --> 01:13:29.604
<i>- Wow.
- He's got wings.</i>

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:33.941
<i>- Uh-oh, watch out.
- Good save there by Najee.</i>

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:37.779
<i>- Yeah, this ring will make
you jump, jump.</i>

01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:40.415
<i>Get off there.
All right, Najee.</i>

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:43.384
<i>- What a run out
of Richardson thus far.</i>

01:13:43.386 --> 01:13:46.220
<i>Looking very confident.</i>

01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:47.822
<i>He did a lot of work
in the offseason</i>

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:49.824
<i>to improve his grip strength,</i>

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:51.893
<i>and he can use that here
on the I-Beam Gap.</i>

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:54.395
<i>- Got to have plenty
of grip strength.</i>

01:13:54.397 --> 01:13:56.030
<i>- You can see, 3 inches.</i>

01:13:56.032 --> 01:13:58.099
<i>The ledge goes down to 1 inch
and those gaps,</i>

01:13:58.101 --> 01:13:59.700
<i>those 2-foot gaps.</i>

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:01.169
<i>Watch the lower body.</i>

01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:02.970
<i>Good efficiency there
out of Richardson.</i>

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:04.605
<i>- And this was the tough spot
in qualifying,</i>

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.207
<i>but they've figured it out.</i>

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:08.242
<i>He's doing almost all of it</i>

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:11.479
<i>with just his grip,
barely using his legs.</i>

01:14:11.481 --> 01:14:12.647
<i>- And he's up.</i>

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:16.017
both: Phoenix,
Phoenix, Phoenix.

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:17.685
<i>- Look at him
pointing to the crowd.</i>

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:20.354
<i>Richardson,
he's getting fired up.</i>

01:14:20.356 --> 01:14:23.991
<i>But now has to make the move
to the other side.</i>

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:25.560
<i>- All right, make that turn,
make that turn.</i>

01:14:25.562 --> 01:14:27.094
<i>Lock it, lock it, lock it.</i>

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:30.164
<i>- Good job out of
the gymnast there.</i>

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:32.600
<i>Really shaking out
those forearms though.</i>

01:14:32.602 --> 01:14:34.836
<i>- I'm telling you, Matt,
I really do believe</i>

01:14:34.838 --> 01:14:37.305
<i>he's gonna be the next
American Ninja Warrior.</i>

01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:39.707
<i>- Bold prediction here.</i>

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:42.643
These 2-inch ledges
make this dismount so hard.

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:48.749
Right through it.

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:50.785
But not a real sense
of urgency.

01:14:50.787 --> 01:14:52.386
- And he needs to be
very careful.

01:14:52.388 --> 01:14:54.522
He doesn't want to do
what James McGrath did

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:56.724
and run out of time.

01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:57.992
- Well, this shouldn't be
an issue.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.660
We know he can make it
up the wall.

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:01.863
- Watch him fly up here.
- Watch the Phoenix fly.

01:15:01.865 --> 01:15:02.964
Whoo!

01:15:02.966 --> 01:15:03.998
- Goodness.
- Look at that.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.500
Hang time, hang time.

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:07.602
Looking like LeBron James
up there.

01:15:07.604 --> 01:15:09.437
Looking like LeBron James.

01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:11.772
- Well, he can't joke around
too much.

01:15:11.774 --> 01:15:12.974
<i>He needs to get up
the Salmon Ladder</i>

01:15:12.976 --> 01:15:14.442
<i>in under five minutes</i>

01:15:14.444 --> 01:15:17.845
<i>to assure himself a spot
in the national finals.</i>

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:19.280
<i>This is gonna come down</i>

01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:21.048
<i>to who gets to the Nail
Clipper in a fast time.</i>

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:23.150
<i>James McGrath was too slow.</i>

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:26.153
<i>Najee should be okay
if he keeps moving.</i>

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:27.922
- You got it, babe.

01:15:27.924 --> 01:15:31.025
<i>- Remember, his season ended
on the Down-Up Salmon Ladder</i>

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.793
<i>on stage two last year.</i>

01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:35.196
<i>He wants redemption
right here.</i>

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:38.032
<i>- And he's up.
- Here we go, going reverse.</i>

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.834
<i>We saw Drew Drechsel
talk about this.</i>

01:15:39.836 --> 01:15:41.102
<i>- Bicep, nice.</i>

01:15:41.104 --> 01:15:42.703
<i>- And what they said is it...</i>

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:45.606
<i>I'll better visualize
the placement of the bar.</i>

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:47.909
<i>- All right, now go touch it.
- Touch it, touch it.</i>

01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:49.343
<i>- He's... not yet.</i>

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:52.346
<i>- He hasn't touched it.
- Touch it. Touch it.</i>

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:53.781
<i>- There we go.</i>

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:56.217
<i>Najee Richardson's
going back to Vegas.</i>

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:57.818
<i>- All right, now, this
is gonna be the real test,</i>

01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.220
<i>the Nail Clipper.</i>

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:00.855
<i>It has been as annoying
as a hangnail,</i>

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:02.757
<i>but he's got it going here.</i>

01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:06.160
<i>- Only Jamie Rahn's
gotten through this tonight.</i>

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:07.695
<i>- Come on, Najee.</i>

01:16:07.697 --> 01:16:09.030
<i>- And you can see
the difficulty there</i>

01:16:09.032 --> 01:16:10.431
<i>on the transition.</i>

01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:12.233
<i>Good move out of Najee.
Now it'll rotate.</i>

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:15.770
<i>It only rotates
one direction, clockwise.</i>

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.540
<i>He's got to test it, make
sure it's locked in place.</i>

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:23.377
<i>- I love the strategy.
- He's... because... oh.</i>

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:25.680
<i>- Najee Richardson.</i>

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:27.915
<i>Even a top ninja
like the Phoenix</i>

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:29.650
<i>can't get past
the Nail Clipper,</i>

01:16:29.652 --> 01:16:32.853
<i>but he did secure a spot
in the top 15.</i>

01:16:32.855 --> 01:16:34.855
<i>He's moving on.</i>

01:16:34.857 --> 01:16:37.792
<i>- Najee got big air
on the Warped Wall,</i>

01:16:37.794 --> 01:16:40.661
<i>and then he tried a new
technique on the Nail Clipper.</i>

01:16:40.663 --> 01:16:42.430
<i>Instead of reaching over,</i>

01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:44.799
<i>he just jumped from
one cylinder to another.</i>

01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:46.300
<i>It worked at first,</i>

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.703
<i>but he couldn't hang on
to that third cylinder,</i>

01:16:48.705 --> 01:16:51.138
<i>and down he went.</i>

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.707
- I just didn't have
what it took tonight,

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:54.909
but it's a lot of fun.

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:57.712
I'm glad I got redemption
on the Salmon Ladder.

01:16:57.714 --> 01:16:59.480
<i>- Well, there's a storm
brewing,</i>

01:16:59.482 --> 01:17:01.182
<i>because the last runner
of the night</i>

01:17:01.184 --> 01:17:03.985
<i>is gonna be the Weatherman,
Joe Moravsky,</i>

01:17:03.987 --> 01:17:06.020
<i>and he's gonna be going
for the buzzer.</i>

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:06.087
<i>His run's next on
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:06.253
.

01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:14.061
<i>- Welcome back to Cleveland.</i>

Joe Moravsky.</i>

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:36.684
<i>No one's been more
consistent than this guy.</i>

01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:38.152
<i>In the past five years,</i>

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:40.588
<i>he's had some huge moments
on the course</i>

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:44.225
<i>and some major
life changes off of it.</i>

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:47.194
<i>A 26-year-old weatherman
from Sherman, Connecticut.</i>

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:51.632
<i>- It's really cool seeing
Stephanie and I progress.</i>

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:55.436
Season five was all about me
and my fiancée.

01:17:55.438 --> 01:17:57.104
I love you.

01:17:57.106 --> 01:17:59.073
<i>- Oh, look at him, saying
"I love you" to his fiancée.</i>

01:17:59.075 --> 01:18:00.608
<i>- Look at this!</i>

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:03.577
<i>Joe Moravsky past
the Ultimate Cliffhanger.</i>

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:07.014
<i>- Season six was about me
and my lovely wife.</i>

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:08.916
There's only one thing
left to do.

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:11.652
Honeymoon at the top
of Mount Midoriyama.

01:18:11.654 --> 01:18:14.689
<i>- No!</i>
- [cries]

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:17.458
<i>- Season seven all about the
little baby we have coming.</i>

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:21.595
<i>- Stephanie fighting
a little morning sickness.</i>

01:18:21.597 --> 01:18:23.164
- Whoo!

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:26.267
<i>Last season, I'm a dad.</i>

01:18:26.269 --> 01:18:27.902
<i>- How is it as a dad?</i>

01:18:27.904 --> 01:18:30.037
- It's the greatest
feeling, man.

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:36.077
- Oh!

01:18:36.079 --> 01:18:38.045
<i>- So this season,
the biggest news is,</i>

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:41.882
<i>we're having a second child.</i>

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.350
[both scream]

01:18:43.352 --> 01:18:45.052
It's a boy!

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:46.687
<i>We just get to experience
the best of both worlds now,</i>

01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:48.422
<i>a little boy
and a little girl.</i>

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:55.296
<i>It's so cool, and to have
that documented for us</i>

01:18:55.298 --> 01:18:57.431
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

01:18:57.433 --> 01:18:58.432
it's, like, a dream
come true.

01:18:58.434 --> 01:18:59.500
I love it.

01:19:01.637 --> 01:19:04.038
<i>- And Joe Moravsky
is on the course,</i>

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.507
<i>and he's flying
through it so far.</i>

01:19:06.509 --> 01:19:09.443
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:12.480
<i>You can see, he's waving
to his wife, Stephanie.</i>

01:19:12.482 --> 01:19:14.482
<i>Her due date is coming up,
so she's at home</i>

01:19:14.484 --> 01:19:16.217
<i>watching on FaceTime
with Joe's good friend</i>

01:19:16.219 --> 01:19:18.886
<i>Jesse holding the phone.</i>

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:22.490
<i>Now he steps up
to take on the I-Beam Gap,</i>

01:19:22.492 --> 01:19:26.093
<i>and you can hear the crowd
chanting "Let's go, Joe."</i>

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:28.963
<i>- They want another finisher.
- That's what they want.</i>

01:19:28.965 --> 01:19:30.965
<i>- Moravsky always has
his foot on the pedal</i>

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:34.635
<i>and has a plan in his head,
and look at him go,</i>

01:19:34.637 --> 01:19:37.171
<i>flying up on the I-Beam Gap.</i>

01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:40.007
<i>- He wants it, Matt.
- Good transition.</i>

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:42.209
<i>- Oh, look at that.</i>

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:44.745
<i>Just don't make
a mistake here.</i>

01:19:44.747 --> 01:19:47.081
- He's going for the dismount.

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:48.282
Yes!

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:50.050
He's destroying this course,

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:52.453
ahead of his pace
in qualifying.

01:19:52.455 --> 01:19:55.723
Going after the Warped Wall.

01:19:55.725 --> 01:19:59.193
- This is nothing
for Joe Moravsky.

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:01.495
- No problem for Moravsky,

01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:03.964
and now he moves on
to the back half,

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:06.433
<i>and this is where
the real drama begins.</i>

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:07.902
<i>He must reach the Nail Clipper</i>

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:10.204
<i>to earn his spot
in the top 15.</i>

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:12.773
<i>Then it's a question is,
can he finish?</i>

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:14.809
- You got it,
just straight forward.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:16.610
<i>- Trying to get back
to the national finals</i>

01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:18.813
<i>for the fifth straight year,</i>

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:20.748
<i>and he's up
on the Salmon Ladder.</i>

01:20:23.753 --> 01:20:28.522
<i>Wow. Well, Joe Moravsky's
going back to Vegas,</i>

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:30.791
<i>but he wants to hit a buzzer.</i>

01:20:30.793 --> 01:20:32.259
<i>- You better believe he does.</i>

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:34.361
<i>He's got to get through
the Nail Clipper first.</i>

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:37.531
<i>- 21 ninjas have faced
the Nail Clipper.</i>

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:38.966
<i>Only one has survived it.</i>

01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:40.801
<i>Moravsky hoping
to be the second.</i>

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:45.206
<i>He said he had a plan for it,</i>

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:47.775
<i>talking about this
reverse approach here.</i>

01:20:47.777 --> 01:20:50.911
<i>Moravsky making
short work of it thus far.</i>

01:20:50.913 --> 01:20:52.346
<i>Oh, my.</i>

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:53.914
<i>He came into it with a plan,</i>

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:56.383
<i>and he is executing
it flawlessly.</i>

01:20:56.385 --> 01:20:59.320
<i>- But this dismount is where
James McGrath went down.</i>

01:20:59.322 --> 01:21:01.488
<i>It's hard to get a good swing.</i>

01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:02.723
<i>- And he's done it!</i>

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:05.926
<i>Moravsky made it look easy,</i>

01:21:05.928 --> 01:21:09.363
<i>and the Weatherman
has this crowd on their feet,</i>

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:13.334
<i>as he moves on to face the
ninth obstacle, the Clacker.</i>

01:21:13.336 --> 01:21:14.635
<i>- I know the Nail Clipper is
tough,</i>

01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:16.303
<i>but this is a beast, too.</i>

01:21:16.305 --> 01:21:20.207
<i>- He is well ahead
of Jamie Rahn's pace.</i>

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.576
<i>- He's like a machine.</i>

01:21:22.578 --> 01:21:24.945
<i>- Moravsky, once he gets
on an obstacle,</i>

01:21:24.947 --> 01:21:26.247
<i>he is going full speed.</i>

01:21:26.249 --> 01:21:30.584
<i>And the crowd chanting,
"Let's go, Joe."</i>

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.954
<i>Going for the dismount here.</i>

01:21:33.956 --> 01:21:35.923
<i>And he's got it!</i>

01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:38.392
[cheers and applause]

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:41.495
<i>Joe Moravsky's
going for the buzzer.</i>

01:21:41.497 --> 01:21:44.131
<i>- Matt, he better watch out.
- With all this excitement,</i>

01:21:44.133 --> 01:21:46.367
<i>Stephanie might
go into early labor.</i>

01:21:46.369 --> 01:21:49.069
<i>- And now he'll face this
brutal final obstacle,</i>

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.638
<i>the Elevator Climb,</i>

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.706
<i>35 feet up to the buzzer.</i>

01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:56.143
<i>All season, we've seen great
ninjas come up short here.</i>

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:59.113
<i>Can Joe Moravsky
be our second finisher?</i>

01:21:59.115 --> 01:22:00.614
- Let's go!

01:22:00.616 --> 01:22:02.549
<i>- Here we go.</i>

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:04.551
<i>Will we end the night
with a second buzzer?</i>

01:22:04.553 --> 01:22:06.487
<i>Oh, look at Moravsky.</i>

01:22:06.489 --> 01:22:08.022
<i>- He's got plenty of strength
left in that body.</i>

01:22:08.024 --> 01:22:09.390
<i>- A high pressure front.</i>

01:22:09.392 --> 01:22:12.559
<i>He is rising,
over halfway there.</i>

01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:14.862
<i>- Boy, he's rising high.
- The arms starting to extend.</i>

01:22:14.864 --> 01:22:17.064
<i>You can see him using
his full body.</i>

01:22:17.066 --> 01:22:18.966
<i>- But he's already close
to 30 feet.</i>

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:21.368
<i>Looks like
an altocumulus cloud.</i>

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:24.204
<i>Look at him,
looking real high.</i>

01:22:24.206 --> 01:22:26.140
<i>- And it's gonna be
the Weatherman</i>

01:22:26.142 --> 01:22:27.975
<i>reigning supreme in Cleveland.</i>

01:22:27.977 --> 01:22:31.946
<i>- That's it!</i>

01:22:31.948 --> 01:22:35.249
<i>- The final run of the night,
the fastest run of the night.</i>

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:38.052
<i>Joe Moravsky's
going back to Vegas,</i>

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:40.854
<i>and he's done it in style
here in Cleveland.</i>

01:22:40.856 --> 01:22:44.258
<i>- Joe Moravsky is just
the second person all night</i>

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.293
<i>to get past the Nail Clipper,</i>

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:48.629
<i>and he just crushed
the Clacker,</i>

01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:51.398
<i>then he pumped his way up
the Elevator Climb</i>

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.300
<i>as fast as anyone this season.</i>

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:55.703
<i>- And he's standing by
with Kristine.</i>

01:22:55.705 --> 01:22:57.404
- Joe, you said coming
into this

01:22:57.406 --> 01:23:00.140
that you felt stronger
than ever this year.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:03.644
I mean, was that just
the best way of showing it?

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:05.312
- You know what, I think so.
- It's hard,

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:06.880
because
when you compare seasons,

01:23:06.882 --> 01:23:09.883
they always get harder,
but yeah, I feel great.

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:12.820
<i>I'm definitely sore now,
but I got some time to sleep.</i>

01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:14.722
- Stephanie was watching
on FaceTime tonight.

01:23:14.724 --> 01:23:16.090
It's the first time
that she hasn't been

01:23:16.092 --> 01:23:17.624
on the sidelines for you

01:23:17.626 --> 01:23:19.693
in all the years that you've
competed. What was that like?

01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:22.096
- You know, it's tough not
having her physically here,

01:23:22.098 --> 01:23:25.199
but FaceTime, it's great.
You know, I can't be upset.

01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:27.267
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:29.169
- Guys, back to you.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.171
<i>- So Joe Moravsky
and Jamie Rahn</i>

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:33.107
<i>sit atop our leaderboard.</i>

01:23:33.109 --> 01:23:36.510
<i>They're the only two finishers
in Cleveland tonight.</i>

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:38.579
<i>All the others moving on
are those who made it</i>

01:23:38.581 --> 01:23:40.948
<i>to the Nail Clipper
in a fast time.</i>

01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:43.984
<i>That includes Chris DiGangi,
as well as his girlfriend,</i>

01:23:43.986 --> 01:23:48.155
<i>Jesse "Flex" Labreck,
who ended up in the 15th spot.</i>

01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:50.190
<i>Joining her as the other
woman to advance,</i>

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:52.860
<i>is fifth grade teacher
Allyssa Beird.</i>

01:23:52.862 --> 01:23:54.428
<i>All these competitors
will move on</i>

01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:56.130
<i>to the national finals
in Vegas,</i>

01:23:56.132 --> 01:23:58.165
<i>now just three weeks away.</i>

01:23:58.167 --> 01:24:00.667
<i>We can't wait for that,
but next week,</i>

01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:02.669
<i>we'll be in Kansas City,
Missouri,</i>

01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:05.839
<i>the fifth stop for our
city finals competition.</i>

01:24:05.841 --> 01:24:07.608
Well, that wraps up
an electric night

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:09.410
of competition
here in Cleveland.

01:24:09.412 --> 01:24:11.879
For Akbar Gbajabiamila
and Kristine Leahy,

01:24:11.881 --> 01:24:13.247
I'm Matt Iseman.

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:15.916
We'll see you next time
on "American Ninja Warrior."
