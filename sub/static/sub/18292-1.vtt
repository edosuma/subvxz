01:22.716 --> 01:24.480
Come on.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.383
Just fuck me.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.363
Maybe we should wait.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.327
Wait for what?

01:39.300 --> 01:41.836
The next time we see each other.

01:43.316 --> 01:45.874
- What?
- Oh, now...

01:46.174 --> 01:49.205
Now I just feel like... like a whore.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.280
That's no good.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.987
Is this your go-to move or something?

01:55.817 --> 02:00.555
You just hook me in and make me
believe that you're this gentleman.

02:01.055 --> 02:03.352
I never said I was a gentleman.

02:05.075 --> 02:07.112
But I'm not playing games.

02:07.662 --> 02:10.092
Well, sometimes games can be fun.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.132
Okay.

02:16.837 --> 02:20.308
- Let's do it. Let's fuck.
- No, it's too late.

02:20.408 --> 02:25.390
It's too late.
I think... I think you're right.

02:25.490 --> 02:28.952
- Let's wait. It's a great idea.
- Oh, yeah?

02:38.726 --> 02:42.358
Maybe you could hold me down
while you do it.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.868
- Tighter.
- Tighter?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.711
- <i>Jefe.</i>
- Yeah.

03:29.811 --> 03:34.378
- Luis just finished cleaning up.
- What, you got a party to go to? <i>¿Fiesta?</i>

03:34.478 --> 03:36.037
<i>Sí.</i>

04:08.415 --> 04:11.413
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, sweetheart.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.990
I'm going to the Tiki Bar later
if you wanna come.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.553
Yeah. Maybe. I'll let you know.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.204
<i>Merci.</i>

04:41.081 --> 04:42.978
Happy Halloween.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.397
<i>Voila .</i>

05:10.411 --> 05:12.474
Oh, my God.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.683
Is that caviar?

05:14.783 --> 05:17.313
Osetra. From the Black Sea.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.350
What else is in this? This is...

05:22.523 --> 05:24.559
fucking incredible.

05:24.659 --> 05:26.828
Crème fraîche. French butter.

05:26.928 --> 05:29.925
Sea salt. Chives. Brioche bread.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.948
<i>Actually, the name of your place,
Rue Galilée...</i>

05:47.048 --> 05:49.311
<i>I lived on that block once.</i>

05:50.317 --> 05:52.147
<i>Me too.</i>

05:52.853 --> 05:54.222
<i>No shit.</i>

05:54.322 --> 05:57.230
<i>It's where I learned to cook
when I was a kid.</i>

05:57.592 --> 05:59.294
<i>Dropped out of high school.</i>

05:59.394 --> 06:02.798
<i>Bought a plane ticket with the money
I saved up baking pizzas in Queens</i>

06:02.898 --> 06:05.494
and flew to France.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.901
What?

06:14.675 --> 06:16.706
You're pretty cool, Frank.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.901
I just love this Tequila.
It does wonders to the nerves.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.467
Okay. Lick.

07:33.219 --> 07:35.474
This restaurant is exquisite, Frank.

07:36.890 --> 07:40.562
And you are a doll
for arranging the reservation.

07:40.662 --> 07:44.232
Well, I was the sous chef here
for five years, so they take care of me.

07:44.332 --> 07:46.695
You still haven't told me why you're here.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.504
Tina Turner has a house in Nice,

07:49.604 --> 07:52.808
and Architectural Digest
is sending me to write about it.

07:53.608 --> 07:55.543
I love the south of France.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.780
Tina has a one-night-only show tonight,

07:58.880 --> 08:01.476
so I'm getting a ride on her jet tomorrow.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.753
After Tina, I'm off to Paris for some fun.

08:05.853 --> 08:09.651
- Where are you staying?
- At Alan's spare flat.

08:11.993 --> 08:14.256
He sends his regards, by the way.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.094
Tell him that I say hello.

08:20.701 --> 08:25.507
So, Lola tells me
that you're classically trained.

08:25.807 --> 08:29.377
I mean, I learned on the job in France,
which I guess would qualify.

08:29.477 --> 08:32.647
I didn't go to cooking school.
I started young.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.582
- How young?
- Sixteen.

08:36.006 --> 08:37.919
Quite an image.

08:38.019 --> 08:40.455
I can't wait to taste your food.

08:41.255 --> 08:43.625
It would be my pleasure.

08:43.725 --> 08:46.528
Perhaps I can bring Wayne
before I leave tomorrow.

08:46.628 --> 08:48.262
- Wayne?
- Newton.

08:48.562 --> 08:52.300
- Seriously?
- He's absolutely lovely.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.904
- Would you like to meet him?
- Yeah. I'll be there. Thanks.

08:56.004 --> 08:59.608
- But I'll be at school all day.
- Not my fault, Lola.

09:00.508 --> 09:02.243
You don't need to be there.

09:02.343 --> 09:04.912
- Mother.
- What?

09:05.012 --> 09:07.376
Stop being patronizing.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.312
Frank.

09:11.001 --> 09:13.265
Was I being patronizing?

09:15.121 --> 09:17.552
Yeah, you were.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.589
But that's all right.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.471
You okay?

09:39.913 --> 09:43.612
What you did with my mom...
calling her out.

09:45.202 --> 09:48.267
You really looked out for me.
I'm not used to it.

09:49.773 --> 09:51.803
Well, get used to it.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.496
Good night, Lola.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.239
Do you fall in love easily, Frank?

10:11.511 --> 10:13.405
No. Do you?

10:19.886 --> 10:22.518
I just don't think
I'm gonna be any good at this.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.260
You know...

10:26.360 --> 10:28.590
I've been married.

10:30.464 --> 10:34.895
I'm sure she was the one,
even though I really barely knew her.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.300
And I dove right in.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.105
Do it.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.891
All I'm saying is...

10:57.491 --> 11:00.356
the way you're feeling
right now, this fear...

11:02.729 --> 11:04.673
I'm with you.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.506
She's coming? For real?

12:18.906 --> 12:21.442
Your mother? That's cool. All right.

12:21.542 --> 12:25.633
Well, listen. I... I...
I know how to navigate those waters.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.583
So listen. How about this? How about this?

12:28.683 --> 12:31.619
How about I take you both out?
You and your mother.

12:31.719 --> 12:35.356
Right? 'Cause it's not every day a girl
graduates from college. That's a big deal.

12:35.456 --> 12:38.126
- Well, I graduated last month.
- All right.

12:38.226 --> 12:40.728
And she's doesn't like insurance salesmen.

12:41.572 --> 12:45.534
Really?
Yeah, I don't sell insurance, so...

12:46.134 --> 12:48.603
Well, she's doesn't like men
who look like David Schwimmer.

12:48.703 --> 12:51.139
David Schwimmer? I am David Schwimmer.

12:52.425 --> 12:55.209
I'm just kidding. So, you find a job yet?

12:55.309 --> 12:57.545
'Cause that's tough, right?
Right out of college.

12:57.645 --> 13:01.215
Well, there's not much of a market
for aspiring fashion designers in Vegas

13:01.315 --> 13:04.418
who don't make stripper heels
or thongs, so no.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.288
You are mad funny. Stripper heels.

13:07.388 --> 13:10.225
- I don't know though. I wouldn't be so sure.
- Oh, yeah?

13:10.325 --> 13:12.961
There's a place next door... KVD.
You ever heard of it?

13:13.061 --> 13:14.165
Yeah.

13:14.265 --> 13:17.265
- There's one downtown. Yeah. It's cool.
- So check this out.

13:17.365 --> 13:20.268
The owner's been making a real effort
to showcase Vegas-based talent.

13:20.368 --> 13:23.805
And so he set up this fashion incubator
to help him out with that.

13:23.905 --> 13:26.975
Let me guess, if I come back with you tonight
and you see where the night takes us,

13:27.075 --> 13:29.959
- maybe you'll introduce me to the owner.
- No, but what I will do is,

13:30.059 --> 13:33.314
I'll set you up with the person who decides
who's gonna be the designer for the incubator.

13:33.414 --> 13:35.628
- You know her?
- Do I know her? Yeah, I know her.

13:35.728 --> 13:38.953
She works for me. I'm the owner.

13:40.254 --> 13:43.654
- Is your work any good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:43.754 --> 13:45.924
I... I just had my show, my thesis show.

13:46.024 --> 13:50.064
Oh, for real? All right, well,
yeah, I'll set up a studio visit.

13:50.364 --> 13:54.168
- You're not kidding.
- No. I don't kid about that stuff, no.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.521
Why are you offering me this?

13:56.621 --> 13:59.107
I don't know. Maybe because you're
being mean to me, and I like it.

13:59.207 --> 14:03.941
I like a little sass. And it's not an offer,
okay? It's just an interview.

14:04.041 --> 14:07.615
And I should make it clear that I don't
sleep with anyone who works for me.

14:07.715 --> 14:10.685
I learned that lesson the hard way.
There you go.

14:10.785 --> 14:13.788
- Keith Winkleman.
- That's right.

14:13.888 --> 14:16.557
If you're interested,
call me on Monday, all right?

14:16.657 --> 14:20.021
- If I'm interested, then I will.
- All right.

14:27.868 --> 14:31.127
- Hi, sweetie.
- You're with Patricia?

14:31.227 --> 14:34.675
No, she's still up in her room.
I've been here for over an hour.

14:34.775 --> 14:37.805
- Are you close by?
- Yeah. Turn to your left.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.309
Hello, handsome man.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.453
- Who was the mook?
- The mook?

14:45.553 --> 14:48.583
Yeah, that tool
that was trying to fuck you.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.026
Come on. He was harmless.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.356
I guess it's fine.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.071
You okay?

15:00.171 --> 15:01.702
Well, they closed the deal.

15:01.802 --> 15:05.506
So new owners, new chef, new everything.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.776
- It's done.
- I'm sorry.

15:09.026 --> 15:12.049
- Yeah.
- You knew it was coming.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.482
I'll be fine.

15:14.882 --> 15:16.851
Yeah. Of course you will.

15:17.851 --> 15:20.248
We're gonna miss our reservation.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.452
I'm gonna try shaming her out of her room.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.189
Hey.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.028
You look beautiful.

15:52.017 --> 15:55.189
Is it too late to make
an adjustment to the menu?

15:55.289 --> 15:58.159
I was thinking salmon
might be a nice second option.

15:58.809 --> 16:00.611
Dinner's in two hours.

16:00.711 --> 16:04.198
- Yes.
- That's not gonna happen.

16:04.298 --> 16:07.868
Maybe we could just add
a second entrée option then.

16:07.968 --> 16:11.233
- Without meat.
- No problem.

16:22.348 --> 16:25.849
Yeah. Okay, amazing.

16:25.949 --> 16:28.590
I can't wait. It's... I'm really excited.

16:31.478 --> 16:33.527
Do you wanna get a drink afterwards?

16:33.627 --> 16:37.089
I will try not to be a fuck-up. Okay.

16:37.765 --> 16:39.974
You too. Bye.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.953
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.773
- Who was that?
- My new boss.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.760
- What?
- No, I got a job.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.748
- All right. With who?
- It's working with this fashion incubator,

16:54.848 --> 16:58.013
and they just pay young designers
to come up with clothes for their store.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.485
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

17:07.644 --> 17:09.613
You're not working for that douche bag?

17:09.713 --> 17:13.767
- No. For this woman.
- But it's where he works, right?

17:13.867 --> 17:17.372
He doesn't work there.
He just owns the company.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.409
Why didn't you tell me you were up for it?
That's a little weird.

17:21.509 --> 17:24.645
Because I thought you'd be mad,
which you are.

17:24.845 --> 17:27.114
I'm not mad.
I just don't like that guy. That's all.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.877
Why? He's been very professional.

17:32.051 --> 17:36.290
- How was the banquet?
- Little old rich ladies who lunch.

17:36.390 --> 17:38.391
They're killing me. They booked me again.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.925
- That's really good. That's great.
- It's catering.

17:42.025 --> 17:45.033
Cooking for private parties isn't catering.
You're working almost every day.

17:45.133 --> 17:50.064
Yeah, but nobody knows how to eat anymore.
They all want gluten-free salads.

17:50.770 --> 17:54.558
I might as well open a salad shop
and call it Salad Guy.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.604
Exactly.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.749
Do me a favor.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.852
Tell this boss of yours...
what's his name?

18:04.952 --> 18:07.955
- He's not my boss. Keith.
- Keith.

18:08.355 --> 18:13.621
You tell him you're in love with a man
who owns an extremely sharp set of knives.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.025
I guess we should celebrate.

19:02.158 --> 19:04.321
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hi.

19:05.277 --> 19:09.543
Will's picking us up at 7:00. He wants to be
on the road to LA right after rush hour.

19:09.643 --> 19:12.047
I'll be on time. I promise.

19:15.104 --> 19:16.768
Hey.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.323
I love you.

19:24.013 --> 19:25.877
Me too.

19:30.603 --> 19:34.007
- All right. I got to go.
- Okay. I'll see you at 9:00.

19:34.107 --> 19:37.738
- What?
- Just kidding, dorko. I'll see you at 7:00.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.342
Dorko.

20:10.744 --> 20:13.008
<i>This is Lola. Leave a message.</i>

20:17.183 --> 20:19.103
You know what? You guys should just go.

20:19.203 --> 20:23.368
- Stop. We will wait.
- No, I got this. It's okay. Go ahead.

20:24.757 --> 20:28.289
If something's up, we'll stick around.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.912
Seriously, you guys go ahead. It's okay.

20:45.012 --> 20:47.608
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.417
Hey.

20:50.117 --> 20:51.946
Where were you?

20:57.840 --> 20:59.704
Baby, you okay?

21:02.347 --> 21:05.664
- I was...
- What? What happened?

21:07.567 --> 21:09.965
I... I think we should go inside.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.104
Okay.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.814
You need a...

21:20.914 --> 21:22.843
You want one?

21:23.431 --> 21:25.012
No.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.122
Honey, listen to me.

21:28.722 --> 21:32.494
- I know... I know you're upset, and...
- Do you want to have a seat?

21:33.294 --> 21:36.663
I just wanna know you're okay.
I just wanna know what happened. That's all.

21:36.763 --> 21:40.666
- Please?
- Can you please have a seat?

21:43.036 --> 21:45.300
Okay. All right. Here.

21:50.276 --> 21:53.809
I... I think that...

21:54.709 --> 21:56.978
I made a mistake.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.006
What kind of mistake?

22:21.890 --> 22:22.893
Hello.

22:22.993 --> 22:25.579
<i>Hi. I'm looking for the owner
of this phone.</i>

22:25.679 --> 22:27.508
One second.

22:28.214 --> 22:31.452
I'm with her right now.

22:31.552 --> 22:33.554
I'm sure she'll be relieved.

22:33.654 --> 22:36.489
- <i>May I speak with her?</i>
- By all means.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.586
Who is it?

22:39.925 --> 22:41.455
You.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.768
Hello.

22:47.868 --> 22:50.437
<i>I'm calling from the concierge
desk at the hotel.</i>

22:50.537 --> 22:55.191
<i>A guest said his girlfriend left
her phone in his suite. Is that you?</i>

22:56.976 --> 22:58.912
- Yes.
- <i>This number keeps popping up</i>

22:59.062 --> 23:03.050
<i>as a missed call. Hope your friend
doesn't mind we reached out.</i>

23:03.850 --> 23:05.686
No, it's fine.

23:05.786 --> 23:09.350
<i>And just for security purposes,
what hotel were you visiting?</i>

23:11.624 --> 23:14.828
- I was at the Encore.
- <i>That's us.</i>

23:14.928 --> 23:18.626
<i>You can pick it up at the concierge
any time. Have a lovely evening.</i>

23:22.068 --> 23:24.705
The Encore used to be the Desert Inn.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.219
- Did you know that?
- No.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.339
Well, that was a little before your time.

23:32.712 --> 23:36.617
I was a saucier there for five years
at the best restaurant.

23:37.117 --> 23:41.549
Sometimes after work, a rich woman
would take me up to her room, and...

23:43.222 --> 23:46.260
The older ones,
they taught me how to fuck.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.328
Oh, yeah. So I liked that hotel.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.565
- Stop.
- "Stop"?

23:51.665 --> 23:56.321
I'm just letting you know that I have
fucked some very beautiful women.

23:56.904 --> 24:01.819
Good ones. They don't worry their mommy
is gonna steal me away from 'em.

24:03.276 --> 24:06.520
Two hours ago, I would've crawled
through glass for you. And...

24:06.620 --> 24:09.144
while I was worried sick, you were...

24:11.634 --> 24:13.437
We're done.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.388
No, Frank.

24:15.488 --> 24:18.233
You were only with me
'cause you can't be alone. Right?

24:18.333 --> 24:22.055
- I was alone when I met you.
- Oh, yeah? For what, 24 hours?

24:22.155 --> 24:24.815
No. Of course not.

24:24.915 --> 24:29.780
So you wait till we're together to start
fucking dudes in fancy hotel rooms.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.238
Good plan.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.421
Who was it?

24:35.041 --> 24:38.728
It was... it was no one. It was...

24:41.914 --> 24:46.620
- Who was it?
- It was a guy from California.

24:47.020 --> 24:51.325
And he's already left town.
You know, it was awful. It was nothing.

24:51.425 --> 24:53.373
It meant nothing.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.796
I get it.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.899
This is what you do, right?
I could be anyone.

24:58.999 --> 25:00.833
It's not true.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.370
You are incredible.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.200
You're a real man.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.775
Oh, my God.

25:08.875 --> 25:13.347
Thank you. A real man
would walk the fuck out of here.

25:13.447 --> 25:18.746
No. Please. I'm not gonna
let you go without a fight.

25:41.639 --> 25:44.863
Stop it. You're hurting me.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.945
Look at me.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.749
Don't stare at anyone.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.535
Frank Riley?

26:56.682 --> 27:00.053
Do you remember
when we had dinner with my mother?

27:00.153 --> 27:02.984
She said she was staying
with someone in Paris called Alan.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.461
Kind of. Why?

27:07.761 --> 27:10.163
He's an old boyfriend of hers.

27:10.263 --> 27:13.962
And we lived with him in Paris
for a few years when I was a kid.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.231
And?

27:18.971 --> 27:20.835
He raped me.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.051
When was this?

27:31.551 --> 27:33.720
Over the summer.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.916
Before I came here.

27:38.857 --> 27:40.327
I...

27:40.427 --> 27:42.522
I'm sorry.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.393
I thought I'd tell you.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.963
No one else knows.

27:54.807 --> 27:57.038
You didn't tell your mother?

27:58.477 --> 28:01.961
I was afraid that she wouldn't believe me.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.396
You said his name is Alan?

28:16.396 --> 28:19.260
- Yeah.
- What's his story?

28:20.332 --> 28:22.730
- Why?
- Just tell me.

28:26.305 --> 28:30.511
He comes from a rich Swedish family
who lost all their money.

28:31.311 --> 28:34.608
He moved to France
to start over from nothing.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.946
Then he wrote a book about it.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.682
It was a hit.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.626
He left my mom.

28:46.026 --> 28:49.062
Found a rich wife.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.799
She lets him do what he wants.

28:52.699 --> 28:55.563
It's very, you know, French.

29:03.709 --> 29:07.812
I'm not making an excuse...

29:07.912 --> 29:10.399
for what I did.

29:12.084 --> 29:16.657
It's just what happened
had an effect on me...

29:17.957 --> 29:20.254
that I can't understand.

29:23.245 --> 29:28.462
But you think you wouldn't have done
what you did yesterday if you hadn't...

29:29.753 --> 29:31.555
if you hadn't...

29:31.655 --> 29:34.507
I guess. I... I don't know.

29:34.607 --> 29:38.538
It definitely, like, fucked me up though.

31:05.547 --> 31:07.210
Frank?

31:07.399 --> 31:10.811
- May I borrow you for a moment?
- Yeah. Sure.

31:17.776 --> 31:21.415
This guys walks out, and she gets so...
boils over, and she follows him...

31:21.515 --> 31:24.651
Everyone, this is Frank Riley,

31:24.751 --> 31:26.582
our chef.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.091
I should get back.

31:31.191 --> 31:33.026
Of course.

31:33.226 --> 31:36.997
This is blah, blah, blah from, you know...
from France or whatever,

31:37.097 --> 31:39.962
- from some foreign country.
- Excuse me.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.878
Maybe she likes cheese.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.241
Hey, hey, Lolita!

31:49.141 --> 31:52.239
- Hi.
- Hello.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.876
I should have known that was your food.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.315
- You didn't get my text?
- No.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.259
What are you doing here?

32:06.359 --> 32:08.962
This is Keith's partner's house.
You didn't know?

32:09.062 --> 32:11.564
No. So, are you that fucker's date?

32:12.251 --> 32:15.802
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, my God. There he is.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.822
Bro, you fucking crushed it.

32:18.922 --> 32:22.125
That was phenomenal.
Believe me, I know about good food.

32:22.225 --> 32:25.495
My dad owns fine-dining restaurants
in LA, so I grew up around a lot of it.

32:25.645 --> 32:27.781
And that was one of the best,
the best I've ever had.

32:28.081 --> 32:30.483
Seriously. Incredible.

32:30.583 --> 32:33.848
- Glad you enjoyed it.
- Keith Winkleman.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.058
Nice to meet you.

32:38.758 --> 32:41.161
Sorry, was I interrupting something?
You guys know each other?

32:41.261 --> 32:44.559
This is my boyfriend, Frank Riley.
Frank, Keith.

32:44.659 --> 32:48.219
Shut up. You're kidding me.
You have a boyfriend, and he cooks like this?

32:48.489 --> 32:51.972
Are you kidding me? Why didn't you tell me
about this guy? This dude's amazing.

32:52.072 --> 32:55.241
- Frank, what are you doing here?
- Excuse me?

32:55.341 --> 32:57.524
You need your own restaurant.

32:57.624 --> 33:00.747
- Yeah. That'd be cool.
- Yeah, it would.

33:00.847 --> 33:02.625
That's an understatement.

33:02.725 --> 33:06.313
Frank had his own place. He's just
in between restaurants at the moment.

33:07.419 --> 33:10.757
All right. Not for long,
'cause I'm gonna check around.

33:10.857 --> 33:14.127
You know how Vegas is. These huge
casino joints keep opening and closing.

33:14.227 --> 33:17.992
You really got to stay on top of it. I'll just
get your information from Lola, and...

33:20.198 --> 33:21.635
I'll look around.

33:21.735 --> 33:24.537
- Thanks, Keith. That'd be great.
- Yeah.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.274
I'm gonna head back in, Lola.
So I'll see you in there?

33:27.374 --> 33:30.255
- Cool. I'll see you in there.
- All right, for sure.

33:36.381 --> 33:38.885
Well, that was pretty funny.

33:38.985 --> 33:42.739
It's fucking hilarious, especially the part
where he said he didn't know I existed.

33:43.089 --> 33:46.353
He never asked me about
my personal life, so I didn't tell him.

33:47.893 --> 33:50.124
I kind of owned his ass?

33:51.863 --> 33:56.315
- Yep.
- So now he'll really try to fuck you!

33:57.309 --> 33:58.465
Shit!

34:19.991 --> 34:23.766
- Hey, baby.
- Yo, Frank. It's Keith.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.202
- Who?
- Winkleman.

34:29.101 --> 34:32.540
<i>Your lovely lady's sitting
right next to me. You good?</i>

34:33.639 --> 34:35.342
Yeah. Where are you?

34:35.442 --> 34:38.338
I'm with your girl.
We're at the space. You got a sec?

34:39.277 --> 34:41.375
<i>You ever heard of Henri Ricard?</i>

34:42.246 --> 34:43.315
Of course.

34:43.416 --> 34:47.217
Yeah, dude's got more three-star Michelin
restaurants than anyone in the world.

34:47.318 --> 34:51.458
- Was that a question?
- Now, listen. My dad financed Chloe, right?

34:51.558 --> 34:54.127
Ricard's spot in Santa Monica.
You ever heard of it?

34:54.226 --> 34:55.795
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I've been there.</i>

34:55.895 --> 34:59.099
Now we're all friends, and now he's
opened up a new spot at the Encore.

34:59.199 --> 35:02.436
<i>It's a big fucking deal.
Auditions were in Paris two weeks ago.</i>

35:03.536 --> 35:06.907
- Yeah, cool. I get it. You're connected.
- <i>Well, listen, my man.</i>

35:07.007 --> 35:09.605
He doesn't wanna bring a celebrity
chef to Vegas. It's been done.

35:09.705 --> 35:12.484
People are over it. Gordon Ramsay,
all these people. Blah, blah, blah.

35:12.584 --> 35:15.181
He wants to launch
a new star right here, okay?

35:15.281 --> 35:18.178
<i>But he doesn't like
any of the chefs that he auditioned.</i>

35:19.518 --> 35:21.688
Frank, I got you in.

35:21.788 --> 35:24.701
His mansion. In Paris. This Friday. Boom.

35:24.801 --> 35:27.710
It's gonna be a mystery basket,
so you gotta improvise. I hope that's okay.

35:27.810 --> 35:29.646
Wait a minute.

35:30.096 --> 35:31.664
You... you what?

35:31.764 --> 35:34.568
<i>Yeah. You're cooking for Henri
fucking Ricard in three fucking days.</i>

35:34.668 --> 35:37.470
<i>Don't worry about it. I took care
of the flights, the tickets and all that.</i>

35:37.570 --> 35:41.775
<i>My commission's gonna come out of Ricard's
take. Show up and cook the meal of your life.</i>

35:42.475 --> 35:45.979
- Are you fucking with me?
- He says, "are you fucking with me?"

35:47.179 --> 35:49.369
No, my man, I'm not. What do you think?

35:50.349 --> 35:53.721
It's amazing. I don't know what to say.

35:53.821 --> 35:57.061
Yes. Hey, listen, listen, man.
Thank me when it's all done, okay?

35:57.161 --> 35:59.358
I got a good feeling about this.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.087
All right.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.608
<i>You're gonna kill it out there,
one-handed or not.</i>

36:28.988 --> 36:30.323
Yeah.

36:30.423 --> 36:32.686
- I know it.
- It's not that.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.556
Then what is it?

36:38.997 --> 36:40.894
Is it me?

36:42.368 --> 36:44.850
I just wish I could go back in time...

36:45.205 --> 36:47.802
and protect you from that fucking scumbag.

36:49.308 --> 36:51.605
Then we'd be fine. I know it.

36:55.731 --> 36:57.828
It's me.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.320
I love you.

37:07.292 --> 37:09.123
Don't forget that.

37:13.131 --> 37:14.962
Good luck.

38:24.053 --> 38:26.256
<i>This is Lola. Leave a message.</i>

38:28.106 --> 38:31.563
Hey, it's me.
I'm going into this thing, so...

38:31.663 --> 38:33.877
I just wanted to call and say hey.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.251
Anyway, call me.

38:39.251 --> 38:41.114
I love you.

38:55.500 --> 38:59.772
Mr. Riley?
I'm Charles, Mr. Ricard's attaché.

38:59.872 --> 39:02.875
- Bonjour.
- The house is just across the Plaza.

39:02.975 --> 39:05.037
- Let's walk.
- Okay.

39:11.683 --> 39:15.672
All of the ingredients are in the kitchen.
Anything in the pantry is yours.

39:15.922 --> 39:19.459
We have one sous chef for you.
He speaks English, but French is preferable.

39:19.559 --> 39:23.056
- Okay.
- There'll be two people eating.

39:32.437 --> 39:34.574
Hello, chef. I'm Khalil.

39:34.674 --> 39:37.208
- Bonjour.
- Nice to meet you.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.172
The basket.

39:41.306 --> 39:43.590
All right, all right, all right.

39:51.623 --> 39:54.388
I got this, man. I got this.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.425
- Merci.
- Okay. Bon courage.

40:06.054 --> 40:08.268
- Truffle?
- Oui.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.570
Smell it.

40:13.177 --> 40:14.669
- Great.
- Right?

40:14.769 --> 40:16.309
Yeah.

40:22.212 --> 40:23.667
Okay, chef.

41:25.192 --> 41:26.360
Roast chicken?

41:26.852 --> 41:28.128
Oui.

41:29.588 --> 41:32.051
You know where you are, right?

41:32.757 --> 41:34.074
Oui.

41:36.027 --> 41:37.407
Bon appétit.

41:46.137 --> 41:48.641
- You used truffle, yes?
- Yes.

41:48.741 --> 41:51.744
- That was not the agreement.
- Yeah, I know.

41:51.844 --> 41:53.966
Okay, I have an appointment.

41:54.066 --> 41:56.624
You can show yourself out.
Thank you for your time.

41:56.724 --> 41:59.560
Make me a report
of the ingredients that were used,

41:59.685 --> 42:01.812
and prepare for the next candidate.

43:58.568 --> 44:00.233
Bonsoir.

44:01.606 --> 44:05.411
Okay. Come on, playboy. Try a martini.

44:05.511 --> 44:08.781
- Your aim is getting better.
- I practice.

44:08.881 --> 44:13.085
Yeah, practice your Martini, American style.
Much more important.

44:13.685 --> 44:15.714
American style?

44:16.888 --> 44:19.352
We like 'em dry in America.

44:20.107 --> 44:21.904
Right.

44:23.579 --> 44:25.914
Only a little bit.

44:34.306 --> 44:36.536
Whiskey, s'il vous plaît.

44:39.777 --> 44:41.841
How's it going?

44:43.398 --> 44:46.669
New York? Brooklyn?

44:46.769 --> 44:49.605
It's Queens, right? Queens, yeah?

44:49.705 --> 44:51.801
How can you tell?

44:53.408 --> 44:54.618
Alan.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.090
Keith.

44:57.695 --> 45:00.960
- I'm sorry.
- So what brings you to Paris?

45:02.367 --> 45:04.737
I was on vacation with my girlfriend.

45:04.837 --> 45:07.309
She left. I stayed.

45:07.839 --> 45:10.476
Well, you don't seem
too broken up about it.

45:11.076 --> 45:13.372
These things happen, I guess.

45:13.745 --> 45:15.742
Yeah, I guess you're right.

45:23.821 --> 45:25.609
Très bien.

45:26.188 --> 45:27.944
Merci, beaucoup.

45:28.960 --> 45:31.030
Alan, right?

45:31.130 --> 45:35.334
Yeah. You know, you look so familiar.
I'm trying to place it.

45:35.434 --> 45:37.970
I know I've seen your face before.

45:38.070 --> 45:40.272
No, I doubt that.

45:40.672 --> 45:42.475
I got it.

45:42.875 --> 45:45.044
You're Alan Larsson, right?

45:45.144 --> 45:47.179
Yeah. Have we met?

45:47.279 --> 45:50.776
No, I've seen your picture on the back
of your book. Your memoir.

45:51.482 --> 45:54.554
I studied it in college in northwestern.

45:55.054 --> 45:56.841
Really...

45:56.941 --> 46:00.326
really fucking brainy stuff. Seriously.

46:00.926 --> 46:02.788
Am I right?

46:06.981 --> 46:10.052
Yeah. Oh, thanks for your kind words.

46:10.152 --> 46:13.456
Hey, you know, I'd like to buy you
a drink if you don't mind.

46:13.556 --> 46:16.475
Wait, don't be silly.
You're the one with the heavy heart.

46:16.575 --> 46:20.306
It's not every day you run into a fan,
so cheers to that.

46:21.746 --> 46:22.942
Cheers.

46:26.117 --> 46:27.723
So...

46:27.823 --> 46:31.264
if you're up to it,
I can show you around in Paris.

46:34.425 --> 46:36.383
You know what?

46:36.483 --> 46:38.360
Why the hell not?

46:52.210 --> 46:55.363
So let's grab one more
and then have some fun.

46:55.463 --> 46:57.360
Sounds good.

47:03.204 --> 47:05.335
Make yourself comfortable.

47:20.071 --> 47:22.301
So you live here alone?

47:22.941 --> 47:25.344
Well, occasionally.

47:25.444 --> 47:27.379
I'm married.

47:27.479 --> 47:30.349
So I have this for when I need it...

47:30.993 --> 47:33.579
if you catch my drift.

47:34.619 --> 47:37.350
- Your wife doesn't mind?
- There are rules.

47:38.256 --> 47:40.926
Certain behavior's permitted.

47:41.026 --> 47:43.495
Certain behavior's not.

47:43.595 --> 47:45.224
Cheers.

47:48.583 --> 47:50.813
With other girls, right?

47:52.987 --> 47:55.404
They have to remain strangers.

47:55.624 --> 47:59.401
But my wife has the same privileges.
Just only lovers, no feelings.

48:00.628 --> 48:02.919
You always play by the rules?

48:05.333 --> 48:08.430
You have a lot of questions,
you know that?

48:15.509 --> 48:18.590
- Oh, excuse me.
- No problem.

48:19.548 --> 48:21.144
Hello?

48:38.966 --> 48:40.697
Excuse me.

48:43.604 --> 48:46.636
So, you read my book
at the Northwestern, right?

48:47.891 --> 48:50.663
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

48:50.763 --> 48:53.959
I was an adjunct professor there
for a couple of years.

48:56.283 --> 48:58.420
So where'd you live?

48:58.520 --> 49:00.323
Off campus.

49:00.773 --> 49:03.803
Let me guess.
Marty Summers taught you my book.

49:04.692 --> 49:08.464
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Marty Summers.
He's a great guy.

49:08.564 --> 49:10.626
Yes. Great.

49:16.204 --> 49:19.072
You never went to Northwestern,
did you, Keith?

49:20.541 --> 49:22.211
Why would you ask that?

49:22.411 --> 49:26.085
What are the chances that an American
knowing my book so well?

49:26.185 --> 49:30.386
And then just runs into me
here in Paris at my local bistro.

49:31.086 --> 49:33.956
Marty Summers is my American accountant.

49:34.056 --> 49:35.985
He's not a teacher.

49:41.929 --> 49:43.526
Okay.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.741
What do you want? What have I done to you?

49:51.140 --> 49:53.803
You don't just rape a girl
and get away with it.

49:54.842 --> 49:57.763
I never raped anyone in my whole life.

49:57.863 --> 49:59.796
Now, who told you that?

50:00.215 --> 50:02.952
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it matters. It matters for me.

50:03.052 --> 50:05.765
You have to give me
a chance to defend myself.

50:10.374 --> 50:12.518
Queens, is that where you live?

50:16.297 --> 50:18.194
So let me guess.

50:19.500 --> 50:21.530
It's Las Vegas, right?

50:24.505 --> 50:27.104
I'm starting to know
what this is all about.

50:29.578 --> 50:32.174
Come on. Hey, hey.

50:59.190 --> 51:01.060
<i>Play with her.</i>

51:01.710 --> 51:03.712
<i>Ask me nicely, Alan.</i>

51:03.812 --> 51:07.577
<i>No. I'm not gonna ask you nicely.
Play with her. Do it.</i>

51:10.585 --> 51:12.115
<i>Fine.</i>

51:15.756 --> 51:17.593
<i>Keep going.</i>

51:17.993 --> 51:20.729
<i>Now look at me. Both... both of you.</i>

51:20.829 --> 51:23.198
- <i>I think I know what you want.</i>
- <i>No, you don't.</i>

51:23.298 --> 51:26.869
- <i>Yeah, I do.</i>
- <i>No, you don't.</i>

51:27.069 --> 51:30.333
- Put it back on.
- Could you please put down your knife?

51:32.706 --> 51:34.537
Put it back on.

51:37.478 --> 51:41.683
<i>You want us... to get rough?</i>

51:41.783 --> 51:44.506
<i>You wanna see it really fucking rough?</i>

51:45.086 --> 51:49.191
<i>You wanna be a part of it, but it's just
the two of us and I'd be left out.</i>

51:49.291 --> 51:51.426
<i>No, I'm not getting left out.</i>

51:51.526 --> 51:53.422
<i>Don't lie.</i>

51:53.695 --> 51:57.650
<i>You want us to love it so much, and we will.
We're gonna fucking love it.</i>

51:57.750 --> 52:01.821
- <i>Do you want me to give it to you rough?</i>
- <i>Yeah, I want you to give it to me.</i>

52:02.471 --> 52:04.333
<i>Come here.</i>

52:05.139 --> 52:08.394
<i>Come here, come here, come here.
Come here.</i>

52:32.968 --> 52:35.598
You asked me before
if I ever broke the rules.

52:36.604 --> 52:38.634
I did once, with her.

52:41.008 --> 52:42.978
So it was serious?

52:43.078 --> 52:45.081
I mean, you...

52:46.381 --> 52:48.443
It was real.

52:48.783 --> 52:50.846
Yeah. Quite real.

52:54.355 --> 52:57.906
And I'm dreadfully sorry
that you had to see the tape.

52:58.126 --> 53:00.597
No man should be exposed to that.

53:01.697 --> 53:04.513
Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I had no idea.

53:05.083 --> 53:07.547
She can be very convincing.

53:10.738 --> 53:13.001
Are you two still together?

53:15.776 --> 53:19.842
- Who was the other girl?
- We met her at a club.

53:21.048 --> 53:24.753
I was actually planning
dropping by there tonight.

53:25.253 --> 53:27.650
Maybe you want to come along?

53:35.497 --> 53:36.865
- Hello.
- Come on.

53:36.965 --> 53:39.391
- Enjoy.
- Yeah.

54:27.948 --> 54:30.459
So I have an early appointment.

54:31.086 --> 54:35.390
- You'll be all right by yourself?
- Yeah, man, I'm fine.

54:35.590 --> 54:38.662
I'm coming to Las Vegas
in a while for business.

54:40.961 --> 54:43.860
Here's my card.
I stay at the Encore Hotel.

54:50.471 --> 54:53.303
- Hey, Alan.
- What?

54:55.409 --> 54:56.906
Thanks.

55:20.026 --> 55:21.861
You aren't participating?

55:23.196 --> 55:24.823
Not really my thing.

55:26.616 --> 55:28.535
Then why are you here?

55:29.369 --> 55:31.287
It's where I ended up.

55:32.956 --> 55:36.751
If I'm gonna fuck,
I don't need an audience.

55:37.618 --> 55:39.621
So what do you need?

55:39.721 --> 55:42.657
A floor. A bed. Not this.

55:43.157 --> 55:46.695
And that's why you're here?

55:46.795 --> 55:50.259
To find someone and take her
somewhere more private?

55:52.516 --> 55:54.453
I haven't decided yet.

55:54.553 --> 55:56.821
Let me know if you do.

55:56.921 --> 55:59.105
I might be able to help.

56:13.621 --> 56:15.874
- How much?
- A hundred.

58:23.884 --> 58:27.489
The restaurant I am planning is not small,

58:27.589 --> 58:30.308
and there will be a lot of visibility.

58:30.508 --> 58:33.179
You are very impressive in the kitchen...

58:33.929 --> 58:37.660
but are you strong enough
for the pressure,

58:37.760 --> 58:41.555
the responsibility
of what will be in front of you?

58:48.725 --> 58:50.255
Oui.

59:04.825 --> 59:08.603
Does the ride that just dropped you off
mean what I think it means?

59:08.830 --> 59:12.645
- What?
- I was watching from the balcony.

59:13.433 --> 59:15.503
Yeah. I got it.

59:15.603 --> 59:17.206
Yes!

59:17.906 --> 59:20.002
I knew that you would.

59:31.168 --> 59:33.031
You hungry?

59:35.923 --> 59:37.820
Yeah, sure.

59:38.892 --> 59:41.815
Good. 'Cause I'm taking you out.

59:52.773 --> 59:54.710
You saw him.

59:55.310 --> 59:57.172
In Paris.

01:00:00.414 --> 01:00:02.445
What did he tell you?

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.218
Come on. Let's eat later.

01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:15.924
Do you have any idea...

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:22.271
<i>what it's like to watch
the woman you love...</i>

01:00:23.171 --> 01:00:25.334
take orders like a little whore...

01:00:30.912 --> 01:00:32.975
<i>Down on her hands and knees...</i>

01:00:39.487 --> 01:00:41.950
Oh, what a beautiful cock.

01:00:51.698 --> 01:00:53.962
<i>He showed you the video.</i>

01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:56.898
He knew I was going to hurt him.

01:00:57.688 --> 01:01:00.092
Because of what you said, you know.

01:01:01.142 --> 01:01:03.739
He took me to his favorite club.

01:01:06.847 --> 01:01:08.850
Did you go home with anyone?

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:11.413
Some rich lady and her friend.

01:01:13.553 --> 01:01:15.617
So now I'm rotten.

01:01:18.392 --> 01:01:20.294
So are you.

01:01:20.394 --> 01:01:22.258
So is this.

01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:28.397
I'll come back and get my shit tomorrow.

01:02:11.211 --> 01:02:14.870
You said you'd be gone by 6:00.
It's nearly 7:00.

01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:18.464
I just want to know what happened.

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.956
The truth.

01:02:22.056 --> 01:02:23.886
You know?

01:02:25.725 --> 01:02:27.395
Please.

01:02:27.595 --> 01:02:29.658
He played you.

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.327
You got played.

01:02:34.701 --> 01:02:36.331
What?

01:02:37.437 --> 01:02:39.868
The woman who picked you up in the club...

01:02:40.874 --> 01:02:42.538
what did she look like?

01:02:43.577 --> 01:02:45.413
What difference does it make?

01:02:45.513 --> 01:02:49.344
Did she live in the 7th, in a mansion?

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:53.943
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's Claire. That's his wife.

01:02:54.043 --> 01:02:57.072
Getting her to misbehave
allows him to do whatever he wants.

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:06.634
He's the one you fucked
in the hotel. Right?

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:08.814
Yeah.

01:03:10.003 --> 01:03:11.517
Why?

01:03:15.408 --> 01:03:17.269
Pour me a drink.

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:39.768
I went to Paris to study...

01:03:40.368 --> 01:03:45.134
and Alan was the only person that I knew.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.838
He said that I could have
the place all to myself.

01:03:53.613 --> 01:03:56.485
And I remember my first night there.

01:03:57.685 --> 01:04:00.321
I was sitting in the kitchen...

01:04:01.021 --> 01:04:04.893
and I was looking out the window
over Paris, and I thought...

01:04:05.715 --> 01:04:09.892
"For the first time,
I'm not surrounded by chaos."

01:04:12.399 --> 01:04:14.596
And then I went to bed.

01:04:17.004 --> 01:04:20.008
And when I woke up...

01:04:20.608 --> 01:04:25.265
he had already tied my hands
and my feet to the bed.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:35.806
It wasn't the rape...

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:39.818
and he did rape me...
that turned me into this...

01:04:40.461 --> 01:04:42.891
this crazy person.

01:04:44.831 --> 01:04:49.476
What fucked me up was that I didn't leave.

01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:52.734
I stayed with him.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.710
What fucked me up...

01:04:56.310 --> 01:05:00.778
Was that I... fell in love with him.

01:05:04.017 --> 01:05:06.448
I found out that I was pregnant.

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:10.719
And he just disappeared.

01:05:12.259 --> 01:05:17.081
I freaked out
and started calling the house.

01:05:17.695 --> 01:05:22.103
His wife said to me that if I...

01:05:22.403 --> 01:05:24.666
got an abortion...

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:30.661
if I left France immediately she was going
to write me a check for $400,000.

01:05:36.716 --> 01:05:40.949
So I came here a week later...

01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:48.474
and that's when I met you.

01:05:51.098 --> 01:05:53.168
And that morning...

01:05:54.068 --> 01:05:59.335
he called me, and he was
begging me to let him apologize.

01:06:01.508 --> 01:06:03.578
And I had...

01:06:04.078 --> 01:06:08.110
I had no intention of fucking him.

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:12.280
And then I... I think...

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:16.885
I just... I think I shut down.

01:06:18.958 --> 01:06:21.056
I just let him do it.

01:06:23.964 --> 01:06:26.061
And when it was over...

01:06:28.935 --> 01:06:30.999
I started to panic...

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:36.058
because all I could think about was you...

01:06:38.512 --> 01:06:40.926
and what I just destroyed.

01:06:44.985 --> 01:06:47.816
- Lola...
- I didn't think...

01:06:48.688 --> 01:06:50.986
that you'd just take me back.

01:06:53.193 --> 01:06:55.290
But you did.

01:07:03.903 --> 01:07:07.191
Baby, why didn't you
just tell me this before?

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:11.440
Why did you track him down, Frank?

01:07:15.882 --> 01:07:20.883
You said that what we have is rotten.

01:07:22.589 --> 01:07:25.320
- And you're right.
- No.

01:07:28.161 --> 01:07:30.665
I'm sorry. I'm so...

01:07:30.765 --> 01:07:34.096
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:41.035
I... I just think that it's...
it's time...

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:45.023
that we let each other go.

01:07:48.681 --> 01:07:50.517
No.

01:07:50.617 --> 01:07:53.070
- You can...
- No.

01:07:55.355 --> 01:07:57.886
You can leave your keys on the table.

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:19.174
The new shit comes Monday, right?

01:08:19.879 --> 01:08:21.743
<i>Sí, jefe.</i>

01:08:22.415 --> 01:08:24.685
You think you can handle
that delivery by yourself?

01:08:24.785 --> 01:08:26.881
Yeah, no problem.

01:08:31.692 --> 01:08:33.861
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- Bonjour, Charles.

01:08:33.961 --> 01:08:38.366
- <i>How's everything?</i>
- Oh, yeah, we're here now. No, it's great.

01:08:38.466 --> 01:08:40.162
It's perfect.

01:08:41.768 --> 01:08:45.939
Well, I wanted to come to Paris
and cook Henri the complete menu.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.022
- <i>Yes, of course.</i>
- Yeah.

01:08:48.122 --> 01:08:51.444
- <i>Très bien. When?</i>
- I was thinking maybe next week.

01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:53.337
<i>Terrific.</i>

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.138
Bravo, monsieur.

01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:44.640
- What's your business here?
- I'm here to see Madame Le Tellier.

01:09:44.765 --> 01:09:48.644
- Then give her a call.
- No, it's okay. I know him.

01:09:53.173 --> 01:09:56.277
If I knew we would be talking
about that troublesome little girl,

01:09:56.377 --> 01:09:58.779
I would not have invited you in.

01:09:58.879 --> 01:10:01.509
I understand. I'm sorry, but...

01:10:03.483 --> 01:10:05.480
I need to hear it from you.

01:10:06.486 --> 01:10:11.140
- Because you don't trust her?
- Because I need to know that I can.

01:10:12.626 --> 01:10:15.096
And if I don't want to discuss it?

01:10:15.846 --> 01:10:17.909
That's up to you.

01:10:22.836 --> 01:10:25.332
Yes, Alan got her pregnant.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.669
And, yes, I gave her money to go away.

01:10:31.344 --> 01:10:34.978
You can let yourself out.
And, please, don't come back.

01:10:41.755 --> 01:10:45.109
He came to see her, you know. In Vegas.

01:10:45.209 --> 01:10:47.194
- When?
- December.

01:10:47.294 --> 01:10:50.865
December? He was on business in Chicago.

01:10:50.965 --> 01:10:52.773
Oh, yeah?

01:10:53.433 --> 01:10:55.530
You sure about that?

01:10:55.969 --> 01:10:58.700
Alan can be reckless, but he's not a fool.

01:10:59.572 --> 01:11:01.603
His heart is with me.

01:11:02.575 --> 01:11:06.514
I was very clear about what would happen
if he made another mistake with her.

01:11:06.614 --> 01:11:09.211
Well, why don't we pay him
a visit and let him prove it?

01:11:09.883 --> 01:11:12.636
Impossible. He's traveling.

01:11:13.086 --> 01:11:14.949
Business trip?

01:11:17.057 --> 01:11:19.354
Chicago? Right?

01:11:25.765 --> 01:11:27.768
When did he leave?

01:11:27.868 --> 01:11:29.730
This morning.

01:13:42.135 --> 01:13:43.665
Lola.

01:13:44.704 --> 01:13:46.801
How's Vegas treating you?

01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:59.547
I should have known it would be you.

01:14:00.887 --> 01:14:03.157
Aren't you supposed to be in Chicago?

01:14:03.257 --> 01:14:06.215
As far as Claire is concerned, I am.

01:14:07.261 --> 01:14:09.730
You have a very trusting wife.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.427
I do indeed.

01:14:18.571 --> 01:14:21.542
- Keith...
- My name is Frank, not Keith.

01:14:22.342 --> 01:14:24.372
This is my restaurant.

01:14:28.147 --> 01:14:30.011
Want a drink?

01:14:36.856 --> 01:14:38.752
Yeah, why not?

01:14:43.162 --> 01:14:44.993
Have a seat.

01:14:48.501 --> 01:14:50.331
Or not.

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:58.516
Well, you're very clever, Alan.
You're always one step ahead of me.

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:10.082
Oh, no knife this time.
You want to frisk me?

01:15:11.558 --> 01:15:14.161
I should not have played that tape.
I'm sorry.

01:15:14.861 --> 01:15:17.225
Oh, you loved showing me that tape.

01:15:18.531 --> 01:15:20.360
Come on.

01:15:21.801 --> 01:15:24.138
So, why are you here, man?

01:15:24.238 --> 01:15:28.736
I mean, I know you want to fuck her,
but is it really worth all the...

01:15:28.975 --> 01:15:31.239
Transatlantic travel?

01:15:32.879 --> 01:15:36.550
- I don't think you'd understand.
- Why's that?

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:41.655
Because you're a fucking monkey who lies
to himself about what turns him on.

01:15:41.755 --> 01:15:45.120
I'm not like that, and neither is Lola.

01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:50.998
Lola needs to be left alone.

01:15:51.598 --> 01:15:54.936
She deserves that,
after what we've put her through.

01:15:55.036 --> 01:15:58.588
- Right.
- You're going to go back to Claire.

01:15:59.807 --> 01:16:03.330
You're going to leave Lola alone.
And you're going to do it today.

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:06.774
And if I don't?

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:09.144
You will.

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:16.324
My wife is someone,
a thing, that I tolerate.

01:16:16.924 --> 01:16:19.153
Lola is my prize.

01:16:26.398 --> 01:16:28.669
Your flight's in four hours.

01:16:29.369 --> 01:16:32.967
I'm sorry. That doesn't work.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.105
You see all these?

01:16:38.811 --> 01:16:41.015
They record sound too.

01:16:41.715 --> 01:16:46.687
Claire gave me her e-mail address. She could
be watching all of this in less than an hour.

01:16:47.365 --> 01:16:51.525
- Right.
- You're not 35 years old anymore.

01:16:51.625 --> 01:16:55.332
Getting a little long in the tooth
for this shit. Don't you think?

01:16:56.363 --> 01:16:57.598
Something to think about.

01:16:57.698 --> 01:16:59.600
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:03.638
Just do yourself a favor, pops.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:17:58.991 --> 01:18:00.888
Oh, fuck.

01:18:02.729 --> 01:18:04.359
Okay.

01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:11.532
You got your passport?

01:18:14.508 --> 01:18:16.944
Your fucking passport. Do you got it?

01:18:17.344 --> 01:18:20.059
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:18:20.159 --> 01:18:24.567
I'm going to drive you to the airport,
and you're gonna fucking disappear.

01:18:27.753 --> 01:18:29.840
- Am I clear?
- You're clear.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:31.522
Okay.

01:18:37.097 --> 01:18:40.722
If somebody ate me, all my, like,
rage and my sexual,

01:18:40.822 --> 01:18:45.126
you know, energy will go into that per...
and I got a lot of it, you know?

01:18:47.273 --> 01:18:49.904
- Is she here yet?
- Nope.

01:18:50.443 --> 01:18:53.174
Make sure there's a martini
waiting for her.

01:18:56.899 --> 01:19:00.053
Yo, yo, yo. I want everyone
to stop for one second

01:19:00.153 --> 01:19:03.457
and just look up here, pay your respects
to the man who made this all possible.

01:19:03.557 --> 01:19:06.060
Frank Riley, everyone. Raise a glass.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.818
Frank, you've really outdone yourself.

01:19:09.363 --> 01:19:11.792
Cheers. Thank you, Frank.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.732
All right, now, you just gotta do it, right?
Just toss it in there.

01:19:33.219 --> 01:19:34.755
Thanks.

01:19:36.423 --> 01:19:38.392
Look at you.

01:19:38.492 --> 01:19:42.630
This is pretty cool, Frankie.
This is pretty fucking cool.

01:19:43.230 --> 01:19:46.934
- Yeah, it's all right.
- I'm sorry that I'm late.

01:19:47.034 --> 01:19:48.929
I'm used to it.

01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:52.091
- They need you back there.
- Yeah, I gotta...

01:19:52.191 --> 01:19:55.225
Go. I know. We can talk later.

01:19:55.575 --> 01:19:57.871
Hazel will take care of you.

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:00.447
What should I order?

01:20:00.547 --> 01:20:04.211
The first meal I ever made you.
It's on the menu.

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:32.907
So, I got some other good news.

01:20:33.779 --> 01:20:35.349
Okay.

01:20:35.549 --> 01:20:37.578
I'm back to being me.

01:20:39.585 --> 01:20:42.601
That psycho... I sent him home.

01:20:44.356 --> 01:20:46.660
That's 'cause I'm not around.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.589
That's not true.

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:52.372
Lola...

01:20:52.472 --> 01:20:54.516
Why do you want me back?

01:21:02.541 --> 01:21:07.475
Because all the reasons to stay away...
they don't work.

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:14.515
And every day I tell myself,
"Yeah, you blew it."

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:17.118
"Get over it."

01:21:20.059 --> 01:21:24.125
And every morning when I wake up,
first thing I think of is you.

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.530
Do you still love me?

01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:37.038
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

01:21:40.179 --> 01:21:43.277
It's your... big day.

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:47.828
Now it's your triumph.
It's so well-deserved.

01:22:02.702 --> 01:22:05.599
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go get changed...

01:22:06.272 --> 01:22:08.502
and you think about it.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:14.341
And if you're here when I come back...

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:17.311
I'll have my answer.

01:22:20.219 --> 01:22:21.649
Okay?

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:25.069
Okay.

01:22:33.502 --> 01:22:35.363
I'll be back.

01:22:36.305 --> 01:22:42.379
