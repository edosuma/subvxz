00:32.201 --> 00:34.200
Please tell me
you're on your way.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.200
Yeah, relax, I'll be there
in five minutes.

00:36.201 --> 00:37.450
Well, can you hurry?

00:37.451 --> 00:39.909
Dad is singing Christmas
songs like he's Frank Sinatra.

00:39.910 --> 00:40.909
No.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.785
All right, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

00:48.576 --> 00:50.158
Mia, hi.

00:50.159 --> 00:51.408
Just wanted to come over
to let you know

00:51.409 --> 00:53.450
how terrific everything is.

00:53.451 --> 00:54.741
This is easily the best
Christmas party

00:54.742 --> 00:56.866
you and your family
have ever thrown for us.

00:56.867 --> 00:59.158
The decorations, the music,
the food?

00:59.159 --> 01:00.491
It's all been spectacular.

01:00.492 --> 01:02.699
Well, thank you very much,
it's so sweet of you to say.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.991
We were worried that we wouldn't
have enough staff

01:04.992 --> 01:05.992
so close to Christmas

01:05.993 --> 01:08.033
but I think we filled it
in quite nicely.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.200
Are you kidding?

01:09.201 --> 01:11.199
It's been amazing to watch
your family in action.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.866
Yeah, well we didn't plan
for my dad's singing

01:12.867 --> 01:15.533
but sometimes he can't
help himself.

01:16.700 --> 01:17.617
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:17.618 --> 01:19.157
This is our good friend,
Kate Clark.

01:19.158 --> 01:21.115
Hi, it's nice to meet you, Mia.

01:21.116 --> 01:24.616
And I agree with Jean, you guys
have done an amazing job.

01:24.617 --> 01:26.366
Well, thank you, and...
forgive me,

01:26.367 --> 01:30.366
but are you Kate Clark
who created Fashion Starter?

01:30.367 --> 01:32.407
Well, that depends,
are you a fan?

01:32.408 --> 01:33.200
Oh, absolutely.

01:33.201 --> 01:34.990
The site is addictive.

01:34.991 --> 01:36.657
I uh, actually got this bracelet

01:36.658 --> 01:38.531
from a young
Australian designer.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.615
Oh. It's beautiful.

01:39.616 --> 01:41.366
And your home offices are here
in Seaford.

01:41.367 --> 01:42.699
It's amazing.

01:44.783 --> 01:47.448
Uh... I am so sorry, um,
if you'll excuse me

01:47.449 --> 01:50.115
your cake has arrived and
I'm needed in the kitchen.

01:50.116 --> 01:51.033
Of course.

01:51.033 --> 01:51.866
By all means.

01:51.866 --> 01:52.824
It was nice to meet you, Kate.

01:52.825 --> 01:54.282
Likewise.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.782
How are we doing?

01:56.783 --> 01:58.156
All we need is some red icing
to write "Merry Christmas"

01:58.157 --> 01:59.240
and we're good to go.

01:59.241 --> 02:00.615
Okay, I'll get the doors.

02:00.616 --> 02:01.866
Okay.

02:10.699 --> 02:12.781
Thank you so much,
you're too kind.

02:12.782 --> 02:14.365
You remember my daughter, Mia?

02:14.366 --> 02:15.697
Oh, so nice to see you again.

02:15.698 --> 02:17.073
It's good to see you, too,
Mrs. Morgan.

02:17.074 --> 02:19.031
We were just telling your mother
what an amazing job

02:19.032 --> 02:20.281
your family has done
with this party.

02:20.282 --> 02:22.489
Yes. Well, it's been a lot
of fun to work on.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.198
Oh, looks like we're being
summoned back to our table.

02:24.199 --> 02:26.156
Ah. All right, well here you go.

02:26.157 --> 02:26.949
Thank you.

02:26.949 --> 02:27.823
It was great seeing you both.

02:27.823 --> 02:28.657
Please give my best to Gary.

02:28.658 --> 02:30.490
I will. Bye.

02:31.490 --> 02:33.781
Look at you, hobnobbing
with the mayor.

02:33.782 --> 02:35.364
Oh yeah, well,
you stick with me, kid,

02:35.365 --> 02:37.656
'cause I know all
the important people, see?

02:37.657 --> 02:38.739
Mom, you should bartend
more often.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.072
You look really cute
in your bowtie.

02:40.073 --> 02:41.864
Okay, you can make all the fun
you like but I am happy

02:41.865 --> 02:45.197
to sacrifice my pride so that
my children don't have to.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.447
Consider yourself lucky.

02:46.448 --> 02:47.988
You could be walking around
as Mrs. Claus

02:47.989 --> 02:49.614
if you fit in that suit.

02:49.615 --> 02:51.030
Mm-mmn.

02:51.031 --> 02:52.280
How's everything going?

02:52.281 --> 02:54.572
Even though two eight-year-olds
destroyed our cake,

02:54.573 --> 02:56.113
Jake has managed
to find us another one,

02:56.114 --> 02:57.239
saving the day.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.031
Great.

02:58.031 --> 02:58.822
Uh.

02:58.823 --> 03:00.572
Oh, speaking of, that's my cue.

03:10.198 --> 03:11.404
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:11.405 --> 03:13.780
I am very happy to announce
that Santa has managed

03:13.781 --> 03:17.364
to find us a spare cake
on his sleigh.

03:36.113 --> 03:39.196
Well, that's it, folks.

03:39.197 --> 03:41.904
Our last party of the season
is officially over.

03:41.905 --> 03:43.695
I have to say I think
I'm gonna miss

03:43.696 --> 03:46.071
the Christmas parties the most.

03:46.072 --> 03:47.363
Mom, seriously?

03:47.364 --> 03:48.946
Aren't you the one that always
complains we have to work

03:48.947 --> 03:50.154
twice as hard in December?

03:50.155 --> 03:52.071
Yeah, I know, I do,
but as tough as they are,

03:52.072 --> 03:56.195
I just can only seem to remember
how happy we made everybody.

03:56.196 --> 03:57.528
That's true.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.946
Think of the joy that I brought
everyone singing this evening.

03:59.947 --> 04:00.571
Dad.

04:00.571 --> 04:01.363
You are crazy.

04:01.363 --> 04:02.196
Watch it.

04:02.197 --> 04:03.613
Woah, that's company property.

04:04.696 --> 04:05.946
Well, it's not gonna be the same
without you two.

04:05.947 --> 04:07.445
Honey, we're retiring
but we're only gonna be

04:07.446 --> 04:09.237
one little phone call away
if you need us.

04:09.238 --> 04:11.487
And besides, you two are
practically running the company

04:11.488 --> 04:12.779
by yourselves already.

04:12.780 --> 04:14.362
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
we don't appreciate

04:14.363 --> 04:15.778
still having you around.

04:15.779 --> 04:17.153
I mean, you guys taught us
everything we know

04:17.154 --> 04:18.362
about this business.

04:18.363 --> 04:20.819
And don't you forget it.

04:20.820 --> 04:24.153
Do you realize that
this will be the first time

04:24.154 --> 04:27.736
in seven years that we have
not worked New Year's Eve?

04:27.737 --> 04:29.195
Has it been that long?

04:29.196 --> 04:30.653
Well I certainly hope you two
have some fun plans

04:30.654 --> 04:33.611
for the big night while
we're off in Palm Springs.

04:33.612 --> 04:34.570
Actually, I think Lori and I

04:34.571 --> 04:35.903
we're just gonna
stay in this year.

04:35.904 --> 04:38.028
I mean, she's six months along
in the pregnancy already

04:38.029 --> 04:39.694
and besides it'd be next
to impossible

04:39.695 --> 04:43.945
to find Emily a babysitter
on New Year's Eve.

04:43.946 --> 04:45.194
What about you, Mia?

04:45.195 --> 04:46.402
I don't really have any plans.

04:46.403 --> 04:48.152
Wait, didn't your friend Elise
have some party

04:48.153 --> 04:49.569
she invited you to in Seattle?

04:49.570 --> 04:51.194
I would have thought
you would have a whole list

04:51.195 --> 04:53.110
of events to go to, honey.

04:53.111 --> 04:56.361
Yeah, but do I really want
to spend

04:56.362 --> 04:58.735
my favourite night of the year
packed into a bar

04:58.736 --> 05:00.319
with a bunch of people
I don't know

05:00.320 --> 05:04.402
all hoping to find someone new
for a kiss at midnight?

05:04.403 --> 05:06.027
Yeah, that's a good point.

05:06.028 --> 05:07.526
I'm so happy I don't have
to worry about

05:07.527 --> 05:09.111
that sort of thing anymore.

05:10.028 --> 05:11.069
Right.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.028
All you have to worry about
is remembering

05:12.029 --> 05:13.861
to kiss your wife at midnight.

05:14.861 --> 05:16.194
That happened one time.

05:16.195 --> 05:17.652
One time!

05:17.653 --> 05:19.860
Okay, you're never gonna
let me live that down, will you?

05:19.861 --> 05:22.360
All right.

05:22.361 --> 05:24.944
Don't stay too long.

05:24.945 --> 05:26.236
Yeah.

06:03.151 --> 06:05.651
Leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.

06:05.652 --> 06:07.192
Hey Jake, I've been trying
to get a hold of you guys.

06:07.193 --> 06:09.817
It looks like I'm gonna get to
your place earlier than expected

06:09.818 --> 06:13.150
so if you're not there
I'll just let myself in.

06:13.151 --> 06:15.318
I'll see you soon. Bye.

06:25.609 --> 06:28.567
Jake? Lori? Anyone home?

06:39.484 --> 06:43.442
Jake? Lori? Are you there?

06:59.858 --> 07:00.858
Woah, woah, woah, hey!

07:00.859 --> 07:02.024
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

07:02.025 --> 07:03.025
I'm David!

07:03.025 --> 07:03.691
I'm Jake's friend, okay?

07:03.692 --> 07:05.400
I'm supposed to be here!

07:06.484 --> 07:07.524
Hey, Jake!

07:07.525 --> 07:08.857
Hey man, you made it!

07:08.858 --> 07:10.523
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

07:10.524 --> 07:11.607
Jake, how are ya, man?

07:11.608 --> 07:14.816
Hey, Mia, what's, uh, up
with the golf club?

07:16.483 --> 07:17.358
Oh, hey guys.

07:17.358 --> 07:18.358
Aunt Mia!

07:18.359 --> 07:20.024
Hey, sweetie.

07:20.025 --> 07:22.440
Yeah, so my uh, my flight
got in early

07:22.441 --> 07:23.732
and I just took an Uber here.

07:23.733 --> 07:26.190
I- I did try calling but it just
kept going to voicemail.

07:26.191 --> 07:28.066
Yeah, reception is terrible
around here.

07:28.067 --> 07:30.440
But I see you've met
my sister, Mia.

07:30.441 --> 07:31.482
Yeah.

07:31.483 --> 07:33.899
Wait, have... haven't
you two met before?

07:33.900 --> 07:35.815
Yeah, yeah, no, when
you came to visit me

07:35.816 --> 07:37.273
in my senior year of college?

07:37.274 --> 07:38.565
Yeah.

07:38.566 --> 07:41.273
Wait a minute, wait, wait,
you had shorter hair, right?

07:41.274 --> 07:44.149
Wait, was she-you were
the one who fell in the pool!

07:44.941 --> 07:46.232
She fell in the pool, remember?

07:46.233 --> 07:49.566
Actually, I was... I was pushed.
It's a little different.

07:50.857 --> 07:54.232
Anyhow, who's hungry, huh?

07:54.233 --> 07:54.982
Yeah.

07:54.983 --> 07:56.482
Yeah.

07:58.066 --> 08:01.190
So, David, uh, remind me again
why you're not spending

08:01.191 --> 08:03.106
Christmas and New Year's
with your family in Arizona.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.689
Yeah, so uh, the original plan
was to join my family

08:05.690 --> 08:07.314
on a cruise but then
I got a call

08:07.315 --> 08:08.856
from the United
Documentary Fund.

08:08.857 --> 08:10.564
They give out financing
for projects

08:10.565 --> 08:12.522
for filmmakers like myself.

08:12.523 --> 08:13.482
They want to meet with me

08:13.483 --> 08:14.980
between Christmas
and New Year's.

08:14.981 --> 08:18.272
They're located nearby in
Seattle and now I'm here.

08:18.273 --> 08:20.022
How many people are you
competing against?

08:20.023 --> 08:22.481
Uh, it's between me and
a couple other applicants.

08:22.482 --> 08:24.772
Well I'm surprised they left it
for so late in the year.

08:24.773 --> 08:27.022
Oh, they had actually chosen
someone a few weeks ago

08:27.023 --> 08:31.022
but that director got other
funding so now I got a shot.

08:31.023 --> 08:32.605
Outstanding. Good luck, buddy.

08:32.606 --> 08:35.022
Thanks. Yeah, uh, and...
and don't worry,

08:35.023 --> 08:36.647
I'm gonna be out of your hair
for Christmas.

08:36.648 --> 08:38.272
I'm gonna go to Sullivan's
and watch the basketball game

08:38.273 --> 08:40.147
and you guys can have
your family time.

08:40.148 --> 08:41.313
Absolutely not!

08:41.315 --> 08:44.022
Yeah, David, our house
is your house.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.230
You're not going anywhere.

08:46.231 --> 08:47.189
Are you sure?

08:47.190 --> 08:48.563
We're sure.

08:48.564 --> 08:50.480
There is no way we're leaving
you alone on Christmas, buddy.

08:50.481 --> 08:51.605
Okay.

08:51.606 --> 08:52.688
Well, thank you.

08:52.689 --> 08:55.606
Um, that really means
a lot to me, thanks.

08:57.689 --> 08:59.855
Ooh, I'm so sorry, gang.

08:59.856 --> 09:01.063
I have to run.

09:01.064 --> 09:02.938
I promised mom I'd meet her
at the winter market

09:02.939 --> 09:06.022
to do some last-minute
Christmas gift shopping.

09:08.189 --> 09:09.979
Oh, and don't forget to come
over early on Christmas

09:09.980 --> 09:11.188
to open presents.

09:11.189 --> 09:12.812
Yeah, of course. I'll be there.

09:12.813 --> 09:13.397
All right.

09:13.397 --> 09:14.189
Bye.

09:14.190 --> 09:15.605
Bye.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.438
Yeah, I want that.

09:27.396 --> 09:28.479
Hey, mom.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.687
I'm so sorry, I lost
track of time.

09:29.688 --> 09:30.812
It's ok, honey.

09:30.813 --> 09:32.604
I ran into some friends
so it's perfect timing.

09:32.605 --> 09:33.687
Thank you.

09:33.688 --> 09:35.229
Can you believe that Christmas
is here already?

09:35.230 --> 09:36.354
No, I can't.

09:36.355 --> 09:38.437
This year has gone
incredibly quickly.

09:38.438 --> 09:40.395
Are you and dad excited
for Palm Springs?

09:40.396 --> 09:41.355
Yes, we are.

09:41.356 --> 09:42.853
It's long overdue.

09:42.854 --> 09:43.978
All right, what's the itinerary?

09:43.979 --> 09:45.395
I'm sure you have a million
things planned.

09:45.396 --> 09:47.853
No, actually we are going
to leave our schedule open.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.686
Yeah, we're just gonna
play it by ear.

09:49.687 --> 09:50.728
Oh.

09:50.729 --> 09:52.020
Mom, no way.

09:52.021 --> 09:54.020
Are you sure you're ready
for that level of spontaneity?

09:54.021 --> 09:55.312
Well, we'll soon find out.

09:55.313 --> 09:56.728
Your dad and I just thought
we would like to wing it

09:56.729 --> 09:59.354
and uh, yeah, with after years
of lists and schedules

09:59.355 --> 10:01.895
then we're gonna just go
with the flow.

10:01.896 --> 10:03.020
Ooh.

10:03.021 --> 10:04.728
Oh, we're-we're gonna have
an extra guest

10:04.729 --> 10:06.020
for Christmas this year.

10:06.021 --> 10:07.478
David Campos?

10:07.479 --> 10:08.978
He was Jake's best friend
in college?

10:08.979 --> 10:10.603
He was at their house
this morning.

10:10.604 --> 10:11.479
Campos.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.728
Oh, I do remember David Campos.

10:12.729 --> 10:14.895
They were uh, they were
roommates in senior year.

10:14.896 --> 10:16.770
I remember him being
a very nice young man

10:16.771 --> 10:18.645
who was kinda good looking,

10:18.646 --> 10:20.353
if I'm recalling
the right person.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.061
Okay mom, take it easy.

10:22.062 --> 10:23.852
I just want you to keep
your eyes open, honey.

10:23.853 --> 10:26.019
I appreciate the advice
but I'm fine.

10:26.020 --> 10:28.061
I know you are but I have
been thinking about you

10:28.062 --> 10:29.519
and your brother taking over
the business

10:29.520 --> 10:33.102
and it's very important to keep
a little balance in your life.

10:33.103 --> 10:35.685
Well, speaking of balance I was
thinking of taking a class

10:35.686 --> 10:37.685
on film production in Seattle.

10:37.686 --> 10:39.311
That sounds great.

10:39.312 --> 10:40.270
I like that.

10:40.271 --> 10:42.019
I just don't wanna let Jake down

10:42.020 --> 10:45.144
when he has so many big plans
for the company.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.685
If he had his way there would
be a Pearson Party Planners

10:47.686 --> 10:48.769
in every city.

10:48.770 --> 10:51.144
It's true, he does dream big
and I love that.

10:51.145 --> 10:52.936
And I love that you care about
that but I want you to know

10:52.937 --> 10:54.810
if you decide to take
a different path,

10:54.811 --> 10:57.060
you're not gonna be letting
anybody down.

10:57.061 --> 10:58.728
Okay.

11:00.645 --> 11:01.645
Speak of the devil.

11:01.646 --> 11:03.810
I swear he has us bugged.

11:03.811 --> 11:05.560
Hello, were your ears burning?

11:05.561 --> 11:06.769
Hey, are you with mom?

11:06.770 --> 11:07.770
Uh, yeah, why?

11:07.771 --> 11:08.976
Can you make an excuse
to go some place

11:08.977 --> 11:10.518
where she can't hear you?

11:10.519 --> 11:13.101
Jake? Hello?

11:13.102 --> 11:14.102
I've got-I've got bad service.

11:14.103 --> 11:16.227
I can't hear you.

11:16.228 --> 11:17.601
Jake?

11:17.602 --> 11:19.851
Hello?

11:19.852 --> 11:20.727
Okay, we're all clear.

11:20.728 --> 11:22.143
What's the big secret?

11:22.144 --> 11:24.018
I just got a call
from Kate Clark.

11:24.019 --> 11:26.227
She said she met you at
the Coleman Christmas party?

11:26.228 --> 11:28.893
She wants to meet with us about
a party she wants us to plan.

11:28.894 --> 11:30.643
Well that's great!

11:30.644 --> 11:32.018
Yeah, we'll set it up
for next week.

11:32.019 --> 11:34.351
Yeah, well, she's actually
flying out this evening

11:34.352 --> 11:35.893
and she's gonna be gone
for several weeks

11:35.894 --> 11:39.392
so she wants to meet with us
today at our offices at 6:30.

11:39.393 --> 11:40.310
Oh, come on, Jake.

11:40.311 --> 11:41.935
It's two days before Christmas.

11:41.936 --> 11:44.017
I know, I'm just worried
that if we don't see her today,

11:44.018 --> 11:46.100
she's just gonna find
someone else.

11:46.101 --> 11:48.226
Why don't you wanna tell mom
about this?

11:48.227 --> 11:49.392
Mom and dad are retiring.

11:49.393 --> 11:50.975
We have to get used to working
without them.

11:50.976 --> 11:53.476
And uh, let's not give them
an excuse to cancel their trip

11:53.477 --> 11:55.267
just to help us prep?

11:55.268 --> 11:56.683
Fair enough.

11:56.684 --> 11:58.726
All right, I'll see you then.

12:09.517 --> 12:10.767
What's this?

12:10.768 --> 12:14.059
Hey, did you know Kate Clark's
family's worth millions?

12:14.060 --> 12:15.433
And her company,
Fashion Starter,

12:15.434 --> 12:18.850
is one of Style top 30
to watch this year.

12:18.851 --> 12:20.516
Mmm, not too shabby.

12:20.517 --> 12:22.308
You know, I didn't get to talk
to her much at the party

12:22.309 --> 12:25.850
but she seems pretty cool
and confident.

12:25.851 --> 12:27.516
All we need to do is impress
her guests

12:27.517 --> 12:29.475
and we'll create a whole new
client list

12:29.476 --> 12:31.558
for the future of our company.

12:31.559 --> 12:34.600
Speaking of the future I've been
doing a lot of thinking

12:34.601 --> 12:36.184
about some things
I'd like to do-

12:36.892 --> 12:38.891
Hold that thought.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.099
Hello?

12:40.100 --> 12:43.350
Kate, yeah, no, the door
is open, come on up.

12:43.351 --> 12:46.267
All right. That's her.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.599
All right.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.641
Hi.

12:54.642 --> 12:55.225
Kate.

12:55.226 --> 12:56.432
Welcome, I'm Jake.

12:56.433 --> 12:58.557
Um, sorry about the stairs,
it's an old building.

12:58.558 --> 12:59.641
Oh, no problem.

12:59.642 --> 13:01.057
You remember my sister, Mia?

13:01.058 --> 13:03.015
Yes, it's nice to see you again.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.182
And good to see you, too.

13:04.183 --> 13:06.140
Kate, can I get you a drink?

13:06.141 --> 13:08.265
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thanks.

13:08.266 --> 13:09.641
Well, shall we sit?

13:09.642 --> 13:11.225
Sure.

13:13.141 --> 13:16.182
Well, uh, first of all,
thank you so much

13:16.183 --> 13:17.765
for meeting me so quickly.

13:17.766 --> 13:19.640
It's our pleasure.

13:19.641 --> 13:22.848
So, Jake, I know earlier
on the phone I mentioned

13:22.849 --> 13:24.098
that I'm leaving on
a flight tonight

13:24.099 --> 13:25.848
and I wanted to talk to you
about a party

13:25.849 --> 13:28.265
in late January I wanted
your help with.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.183
Yep.

13:29.184 --> 13:32.681
Well, um, that wasn't
exactly true.

13:32.682 --> 13:34.057
It wasn't?

13:34.058 --> 13:38.015
No, um... I just had to say that
so I didn't scare you both off.

13:38.016 --> 13:39.057
Scare us off?

13:39.058 --> 13:40.514
The real situation is

13:40.515 --> 13:44.431
that I'm not really travelling
anywhere tonight.

13:44.432 --> 13:48.681
I'm here because I just lost
my original party planner

13:48.682 --> 13:51.389
and his entire staff

13:51.390 --> 13:55.889
and everyone he contracted
for my party.

13:55.890 --> 13:58.181
I'm not sure I've ever even
heard of that happening before

13:58.182 --> 14:00.680
with a reputable company.

14:00.681 --> 14:03.014
Yeah, but what's done is done.

14:03.015 --> 14:05.306
The bottom line is
I need your help.

14:05.307 --> 14:07.097
Of course, we would love
to help you,

14:07.098 --> 14:08.764
we just need to know
what the occasion is

14:08.765 --> 14:10.348
and what dates
you were considering.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.430
Of course.

14:11.431 --> 14:13.722
Well, uh, it's one and the same.

14:13.723 --> 14:15.348
New Year's Eve.

14:17.389 --> 14:21.097
You couldn't possibly mean
this New Year's Eve, right?

14:21.098 --> 14:22.472
Yep.

14:22.473 --> 14:24.847
The one eight days from now?

14:24.848 --> 14:26.263
That's the one.

14:26.264 --> 14:28.180
And how many guests
are we talking about?

14:28.181 --> 14:31.555
100, 125-ish.

14:31.556 --> 14:33.013
Uh-huh.

14:33.014 --> 14:35.846
Before you say anything,

14:35.847 --> 14:39.388
you need to understand how
important this night is for me.

14:39.389 --> 14:42.180
I have thrown a New Year's Eve
party every year

14:42.181 --> 14:43.513
for the past six years.

14:43.514 --> 14:45.846
If I cancel this party
the fashion community

14:45.847 --> 14:48.388
will think there's something
wrong with my business.

14:48.389 --> 14:49.596
It could ruin me.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.347
Kate, I am so sorry but
it would be near impossible

14:52.348 --> 14:55.055
and this is the most difficult
week of the year-

14:55.056 --> 14:56.223
Double.

14:59.472 --> 15:00.763
Excuse me?

15:00.764 --> 15:04.972
I will pay you double your
usual rate for one week's work.

15:07.764 --> 15:10.554
Uh, Kate, would-would you
mind if my sister and I

15:10.555 --> 15:13.387
just went and spoke privately
for a minute?

15:13.388 --> 15:15.930
Oh, no, of course.

15:23.555 --> 15:24.430
Don't even think about it.

15:24.431 --> 15:25.845
This is a recipe for disaster.

15:25.846 --> 15:27.304
Just listen to me
for one second.

15:27.305 --> 15:29.095
Good luck finding anyone
who will work New Year's

15:29.096 --> 15:30.803
who isn't already booked.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.428
Hey, just hear me out.

15:32.429 --> 15:34.386
Now, I completely agree
with everything you're saying

15:34.387 --> 15:36.511
and normally I would agree that
we should walk away from this

15:36.512 --> 15:39.221
but as you are aware the last
few months have not been

15:39.222 --> 15:41.095
as busy as we're used to.

15:41.096 --> 15:43.137
And we've got rent, insurance,

15:43.138 --> 15:47.012
and advertising all due
at the start of January.

15:47.013 --> 15:50.178
More importantly, think of
the contacts we're gonna make.

15:50.179 --> 15:51.969
Her guest list is gonna be
a who's who

15:51.970 --> 15:54.178
of Washington's rich and famous.

15:54.179 --> 15:57.178
So, what do you say?

15:57.179 --> 15:59.346
Just do it for your big brother.

16:07.637 --> 16:11.011
Congratulations, you have
yourself some party planners.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.012
Yes?

16:12.013 --> 16:13.178
Yep.

16:13.179 --> 16:15.303
Oh, that's fantastic!

16:15.304 --> 16:16.012
Thank you!

16:16.012 --> 16:16.970
Oh!

16:16.970 --> 16:17.637
Thank you!

16:17.637 --> 16:18.637
Oh...

16:19.221 --> 16:21.344
Great.

16:21.345 --> 16:22.845
Great.

16:38.011 --> 16:39.302
Yes.

16:39.303 --> 16:43.135
Yes, mom, they are treating me
like one of the family.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.010
Uh, I-I got to get inside.

16:45.011 --> 16:47.344
They're starting
to open presents.

16:47.345 --> 16:50.427
Okay, well tell everybody
I said hello, okay?

16:50.428 --> 16:52.843
I love you, too.

16:52.844 --> 16:55.676
Feliz Navidad, madre.

16:55.677 --> 16:57.303
Bye.

17:11.301 --> 17:12.509
Ah-ha-ha.

17:12.510 --> 17:13.510
Look at you guys.

17:13.511 --> 17:15.343
It's like she's the Queen
of England.

17:15.344 --> 17:17.259
Oh, there we go.

17:17.260 --> 17:18.093
She's better.

17:18.094 --> 17:19.925
She's the Princess of Seaford.

17:19.926 --> 17:21.509
Ooh.

17:21.510 --> 17:25.009
Look mom, this one's
for all of us from David.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.344
Oh!

17:30.676 --> 17:31.967
An ice cream machine!

17:31.968 --> 17:33.508
I love it! I love it! I love it!

17:33.509 --> 17:34.592
Thank you!

17:34.593 --> 17:35.385
Of course.

17:35.386 --> 17:36.634
David, you didn't have to.

17:36.635 --> 17:37.551
Oh, come on.

17:37.551 --> 17:38.468
Who doesn't want
an ice cream machine

17:38.469 --> 17:40.177
in the middle of winter, right?

17:41.551 --> 17:44.342
It looks like this family gift
has become an Emily gift now.

17:44.343 --> 17:45.259
Thanks buddy.

17:45.260 --> 17:46.383
Yeah, of course.

17:46.384 --> 17:48.508
All right, it's my turn.

17:48.509 --> 17:49.634
Dun-da-da-da!

17:49.635 --> 17:51.342
Oh, what could that be?

17:51.343 --> 17:52.092
Oh.

17:52.092 --> 17:53.009
Surprise.

17:53.009 --> 17:53.968
Titanium.

17:53.969 --> 17:55.050
You are so beautiful.

17:55.051 --> 17:57.176
Run away with me
to Palm Springs.

17:59.009 --> 18:00.091
I thought he was talking to me.

18:00.092 --> 18:01.258
Of course, I was.

18:01.259 --> 18:03.508
Uh-oh, there may be one here
for you, David.

18:03.509 --> 18:05.467
Oh, you didn't have to do
anything for me.

18:05.468 --> 18:06.841
Yes, we did.

18:06.842 --> 18:09.008
Spending Christmas with
the Princess of Seaford

18:09.009 --> 18:10.633
is more than I could
have asked for...

18:10.634 --> 18:13.258
But thank you very much.

18:13.259 --> 18:17.634
Um... all right.

18:21.176 --> 18:25.508
Top Documentary Filmmakers
of the 21st Century.

18:25.509 --> 18:27.716
This... this really means a lot.

18:27.717 --> 18:30.132
Thanks guys.

18:30.133 --> 18:31.341
It's a book.

18:31.342 --> 18:32.674
See I told you you'd like it.

18:32.675 --> 18:34.674
I love it! Thank you, guys!

18:34.675 --> 18:36.383
Best Christmas ever.

18:42.925 --> 18:44.049
Any left in there?

18:44.050 --> 18:45.425
Yeah.

18:49.799 --> 18:50.508
Thank you.

18:50.509 --> 18:52.715
No worries.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.674
I am going to go outside
and sit by the fire.

19:05.382 --> 19:08.132
Are you coming?

19:08.133 --> 19:09.883
Yeah. Sure.

19:14.674 --> 19:16.007
Ah...

19:18.633 --> 19:22.089
So, when is your meeting at
the documentary fund group?

19:22.090 --> 19:25.131
Well, uh, it's scheduled
for Wednesday right now.

19:25.132 --> 19:26.256
And what happens if you get it?

19:26.257 --> 19:28.632
Where will you shoot
your next documentary?

19:28.633 --> 19:32.423
Okay, I uh, I'm planning
to spend the next six months,

19:32.424 --> 19:34.173
uh, travelling through China.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.465
I really want to document
the panda population.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.381
Oh, that sounds exciting.

19:38.382 --> 19:39.505
Yeah, yeah.

19:39.506 --> 19:41.340
Um... you know,
I've-I've travelled extensively

19:41.341 --> 19:44.505
all throughout southeast Asia,

19:44.506 --> 19:47.006
uh, for pleasure
and for work but I...

19:47.007 --> 19:49.131
I've never been to China.

19:49.132 --> 19:50.505
Crazy.

19:50.506 --> 19:53.090
You're quite the adventurer,
aren't you?

19:55.673 --> 19:57.380
You know, I wasn't when
I was younger.

19:57.381 --> 19:57.965
No.

19:57.965 --> 19:58.965
Uh-uh.

19:58.966 --> 20:00.339
Uh, so right out of college
I joined,

20:00.340 --> 20:03.589
uh, an old girlfriend
for a trip to Thailand,

20:03.590 --> 20:05.422
uh, and on that trip we met
this film crew

20:05.423 --> 20:07.464
and they were documenting
elephants.

20:07.465 --> 20:10.422
And it was-it was unreal.

20:10.423 --> 20:12.505
What happened to the girlfriend?

20:12.506 --> 20:13.713
We broke up.

20:13.714 --> 20:14.880
She went home.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.255
But I stayed, uh, for about
three weeks working

20:17.256 --> 20:22.130
with that film crew and
since then I've been hooked.

20:22.131 --> 20:24.297
That's one way to start
a career.

20:24.298 --> 20:26.005
Yeah.

20:26.006 --> 20:27.172
How about you?

20:27.173 --> 20:29.838
You seem pretty handy
in there with that camera.

20:29.839 --> 20:32.171
I've picked up a trick
or two over the years.

20:32.172 --> 20:33.463
Oh yeah?

20:33.464 --> 20:36.129
Well, how long have you been
making videos?

20:36.130 --> 20:38.463
Oh, since I was a kid.

20:38.464 --> 20:40.755
Um, I used to play around
with my dad's old Super 8

20:40.756 --> 20:41.756
whenever I could.

20:43.339 --> 20:47.338
You ever think about making
a career out of it?

20:47.339 --> 20:51.879
I used to think about it a lot
but as the business took off

20:51.880 --> 20:54.171
and my family needed me
more and more...

20:54.172 --> 20:58.880
I just-I feel like that ship
has sailed.

21:00.671 --> 21:01.504
Hey, you two.

21:01.505 --> 21:02.587
This ain't no free ride.

21:02.588 --> 21:04.254
You got to work for your stuff
around here.

21:04.255 --> 21:05.587
Pearson, you're on table duty.

21:05.588 --> 21:08.378
Campos, I need you
to peel some potatoes.

21:08.379 --> 21:10.213
Can you not see that
we're trying to have a creative

21:10.214 --> 21:12.295
conversation over here?

21:12.296 --> 21:15.462
I'm sure there's plenty of
creative ways to peel a potato.

21:15.463 --> 21:17.338
Come on.

21:23.838 --> 21:27.420
Okay, who's ready for dessert?

21:27.421 --> 21:31.753
I'm stuffed but I can't resist.

21:31.754 --> 21:33.462
I'd like to raise a toast.

21:33.463 --> 21:35.170
Oh dear, here we go.

21:35.171 --> 21:36.961
To disco.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.128
Oh, come on, dad.

21:38.129 --> 21:39.378
How many times do we have
to hear this story?

21:39.379 --> 21:40.586
It was New Year's Eve.

21:40.587 --> 21:41.379
Okay.

21:41.380 --> 21:42.836
I was a waitress
at a local club.

21:42.837 --> 21:45.961
I was wandering through town and
I heard my favourite disco song

21:45.962 --> 21:49.836
coming from the club so
I decided to check it out.

21:49.837 --> 21:52.502
He was early, we had
only just opened.

21:52.503 --> 21:54.128
There she was.

21:54.129 --> 21:58.920
The most beautiful waitress
I have ever laid eyes on

21:58.921 --> 22:01.544
roller-skating towards me
to take my order.

22:01.545 --> 22:02.378
Was that grandma?

22:02.379 --> 22:03.586
That was grandma.

22:03.587 --> 22:05.461
I had just learned how
to roller-skate

22:05.462 --> 22:08.169
and I certainly hadn't learned
how to stop, so...

22:08.170 --> 22:11.835
There she is, coming towards me,
she's getting closer and closer

22:11.836 --> 22:16.127
and I'm thinking hmm,
she's not slowing down.

22:16.128 --> 22:17.502
Nope.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.377
And I crashed right into him and
we both ended up on the floor.

22:20.378 --> 22:21.835
So, it was...

22:21.836 --> 22:24.460
Love at first crash.

22:24.461 --> 22:25.793
Yes, it was.

22:25.794 --> 22:26.919
That's his favourite line.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.585
Oh, wow.

22:28.586 --> 22:29.337
I got it.

22:29.337 --> 22:30.170
No, no.

22:30.171 --> 22:31.835
I'll give you a hand.

22:31.836 --> 22:34.044
I'll supervise.

22:34.045 --> 22:35.335
I'll eat dessert.

22:35.336 --> 22:35.920
Mm-hmm.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.628
Good idea.

22:39.669 --> 22:41.126
Almost finished.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.668
Nice and slow, son. You got it.

22:42.669 --> 22:44.585
Yeah, yeah, not-not too slow
'cause my hands

22:44.586 --> 22:46.168
are about to freeze off, man.

22:46.169 --> 22:47.461
Come on.

22:49.377 --> 22:51.668
You did what?

22:51.669 --> 22:53.918
Mia, what are you thinking?

22:53.919 --> 22:55.585
Mom, it was a spontaneous
decision,

22:55.586 --> 22:57.168
we didn't have a lot of time
to think about it.

22:57.169 --> 22:59.335
But honey, that's-
that's six days from now.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.210
You can't get anything done
in six days.

23:01.211 --> 23:03.667
I get it, but what's done
is done and Jake is right.

23:03.668 --> 23:05.834
This could be a big deal
for the company.

23:05.835 --> 23:07.959
Well, then I don't-I don't see
how your father and I

23:07.960 --> 23:09.834
can possibly go on vacation now.

23:09.835 --> 23:10.835
What-no.

23:10.836 --> 23:12.375
No, mom, you're not
cancelling anything.

23:12.376 --> 23:13.584
You're both gonna go
on this trip

23:13.585 --> 23:18.001
and everything is going
to be fine.

23:18.002 --> 23:18.919
Are you sure?

23:18.920 --> 23:21.001
Yes, I'm sure.

23:21.002 --> 23:22.835
Nothing's going to go wrong.

23:24.543 --> 23:25.543
Watch out! Watch out!

23:26.418 --> 23:27.168
Jake!

23:27.169 --> 23:28.251
Are you okay?

23:36.418 --> 23:38.209
Gary texted that they're
gonna get a bite to eat

23:38.210 --> 23:41.042
after the movie so Emily
will come home after lunch.

23:41.043 --> 23:42.043
Great, thanks.

23:42.044 --> 23:43.791
So, what did the doctor say?

23:43.792 --> 23:45.958
Well, the fracture isn't too bad

23:45.959 --> 23:47.833
but he'll have to wear a cast
for a month.

23:47.834 --> 23:50.917
The worst part he said I have to
keep off it for at least a week.

23:50.918 --> 23:51.958
A week?

23:51.959 --> 23:53.209
I know, it's the biggest job
we've ever had

23:53.210 --> 23:54.791
and I've been benched.

23:54.792 --> 23:56.125
Okay, that makes it official.

23:56.126 --> 23:57.541
We're cancelling our trip.

23:57.542 --> 23:58.459
No way.

23:58.459 --> 23:59.168
We have to.

23:59.169 --> 24:00.374
I... I can handle it,

24:00.375 --> 24:03.541
we just need to hire someone
to fill in for Jake.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.374
We need someone
we can trust, now.

24:05.375 --> 24:06.959
Like today.

24:08.375 --> 24:09.916
Hey guys.

24:09.917 --> 24:13.791
Okay, unfortunately they were
out of tortilla chips

24:13.792 --> 24:16.666
but I got some potato chips.

24:16.667 --> 24:17.791
Uh?

24:21.375 --> 24:22.999
What, can he not eat
potato chips?

24:23.000 --> 24:24.166
Quick question.

24:24.167 --> 24:26.749
You don't have any New Year's
plans yet, do you?

24:26.750 --> 24:28.082
No, why?

24:28.083 --> 24:29.999
Well, as you can see, I'm out of
commission for at least a week,

24:30.000 --> 24:34.665
maybe more, so we were thinking
maybe you could help us

24:34.666 --> 24:37.167
with our New Year's Eve party.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.249
You're kidding, right?

24:47.833 --> 24:50.498
Yeah, look, I would do anything
to help your brother out, right?

24:50.499 --> 24:52.498
He's the only reason why
I graduated college

24:52.499 --> 24:56.332
but I've never planned
a party before.

24:56.333 --> 24:58.415
Well, you've been
to parties, right?

24:58.416 --> 24:59.498
Of course.

24:59.499 --> 25:00.748
So just think about what makes
a party great

25:00.749 --> 25:02.831
and then reverse engineer it.

25:02.832 --> 25:04.831
I think it's a little easier
said than done.

25:04.832 --> 25:06.664
Oh, David, come on.

25:06.665 --> 25:07.831
You have shot, directed,

25:07.832 --> 25:11.456
and produced documentaries
all over the world.

25:11.457 --> 25:14.333
Compared to that this'll be
a piece of cake.

25:15.749 --> 25:17.123
You did some research on me.

25:17.124 --> 25:20.207
Mm... that's our family motto.
Do your homework.

25:20.208 --> 25:22.124
Well I'm very impressed.

25:25.041 --> 25:28.414
And you are not gonna let me
off the hook, are you?

25:28.415 --> 25:30.290
We need your help.

25:34.457 --> 25:36.872
Okay. Okay.

25:36.873 --> 25:38.372
When do we get started?

25:38.373 --> 25:40.123
Now.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.248
All right.

25:45.081 --> 25:46.414
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

25:46.415 --> 25:49.164
We have six days,
but only six days,

25:49.165 --> 25:50.663
to find a decent band

25:50.664 --> 25:52.872
who isn't already booked
on New Year's Eve,

25:52.873 --> 25:54.413
locate a caterer
who is available

25:54.414 --> 25:56.164
on the busiest night
of the year,

25:56.165 --> 25:57.997
find a good florist
in the dead of winter,

25:57.998 --> 26:00.997
oh, and a fireworks team who
has more than just sparklers

26:00.998 --> 26:03.330
which is pretty much all we're
gonna find at this point.

26:03.331 --> 26:04.580
I think that's pretty much
everything.

26:04.581 --> 26:06.080
Any other questions?

26:06.081 --> 26:10.455
Actually, why-why is this party
so important to you guys?

26:10.456 --> 26:11.996
Well, as you may
or may not know,

26:11.997 --> 26:13.622
my parents are retiring soon

26:13.623 --> 26:15.663
and leaving the business
to me and Jake.

26:15.664 --> 26:18.413
This is our first party on our
own and if we don't do well

26:18.414 --> 26:22.871
then people may be wary of
working with us from now on.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.871
Okay, I get it.

26:24.872 --> 26:27.330
And also, it's the first party
of the new year

26:27.331 --> 26:31.038
which I believe sets the tone
for the years to come.

26:31.039 --> 26:32.621
You know, I think-I think
I actually read somewhere

26:32.622 --> 26:37.537
that we celebrate New Year's
because of some Roman god

26:37.538 --> 26:38.662
or something,

26:38.663 --> 26:40.163
I don't know, I might have
just made that up.

26:40.164 --> 26:41.164
No, that's-that's true.

26:41.165 --> 26:43.412
It's the god Janus,
he of two faces.

26:43.413 --> 26:45.079
One face always looking back
into the past

26:45.080 --> 26:48.704
and the other looking forward
into the future.

26:48.705 --> 26:49.829
Okay.

26:49.830 --> 26:54.162
Well, here's to uh, hoping
we have a great party

26:54.163 --> 26:54.954
in our future.

26:54.955 --> 26:56.538
I will toast to that.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.454
Hello?

27:03.455 --> 27:05.329
Pearson Party Planners
here for Kate Clark.

27:05.330 --> 27:07.330
Come in, we're expecting you.

27:24.370 --> 27:26.453
Look at this place!

27:26.454 --> 27:29.995
This place is amazing!

27:29.996 --> 27:31.912
Well, we know she
can afford the caterer.

27:31.913 --> 27:33.412
Yeah.

27:37.495 --> 27:39.161
Hi, I'm Paul.

27:39.162 --> 27:40.827
I'm Kate's assistant.

27:40.828 --> 27:42.369
She's waiting for you inside.

27:42.370 --> 27:43.453
Uh, nice to meet you, Paul.

27:43.454 --> 27:45.494
Uh, is it okay if I uh,
take some photos

27:45.495 --> 27:46.827
and video of the property?

27:46.828 --> 27:50.119
Um... Yes, of course, just
follow the path to the back.

27:50.120 --> 27:50.912
Okay.

27:50.912 --> 27:51.703
We'll meet up with you shortly.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.036
Okay.

27:53.037 --> 27:54.703
This way please.

28:03.037 --> 28:03.912
Hi, Mia, welcome.

28:03.913 --> 28:05.493
Come in, come in.

28:05.494 --> 28:07.161
Sorry I look like such a wreck.

28:07.162 --> 28:08.994
There are a million things going
on with my company,

28:08.995 --> 28:11.077
as if I didn't have enough
to deal with this week.

28:11.078 --> 28:12.327
Can I get you something
to drink?

28:12.328 --> 28:13.577
No, I'm fine.

28:13.578 --> 28:14.660
Paul, just let me know if you
hear from the lawyer.

28:14.661 --> 28:15.827
Mm. Will do.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.535
So, I won't take up too much
of your time,

28:17.536 --> 28:19.118
we just wanted to check
the layout of the house,

28:19.119 --> 28:21.202
the atmosphere, and of course,

28:21.203 --> 28:24.118
make sure that we're all
on the same page.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.826
So, where's your brother?

28:25.827 --> 28:27.243
Wasn't he supposed
to be here as well?

28:27.244 --> 28:29.327
I actually wanted to talk
to you about that.

28:29.328 --> 28:31.368
Jake has had a little accident.

28:31.369 --> 28:33.035
Oh no. Is he ok?

28:33.036 --> 28:33.994
He broke his leg.

28:33.995 --> 28:35.534
Oh, that's terrible. Is it bad?

28:35.535 --> 28:38.327
It's bad enough that he won't be
able to help me with your party.

28:38.328 --> 28:39.576
You're kidding?

28:39.577 --> 28:42.118
I mean, not that we need a man
to help us do anything

28:42.119 --> 28:43.451
as far as I'm concerned

28:43.452 --> 28:46.160
but are you gonna be able
to pull this off by yourself?

28:46.161 --> 28:47.492
I'll be fine.

28:47.493 --> 28:50.744
And just in case I even called
in a family friend to help me.

28:52.785 --> 28:55.035
This is beautiful.

28:55.036 --> 28:56.826
Pretty nice, huh?

28:56.827 --> 28:58.618
I forget how much I take it
for granted

28:58.619 --> 29:01.326
until I show it to people
for the first time.

29:01.327 --> 29:03.243
It really is incredible.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.409
Who is that?

29:06.410 --> 29:08.492
Oh, that's David.

29:08.493 --> 29:09.493
He is Jake's friend.

29:09.494 --> 29:11.326
He'll be the one helping me.

29:11.327 --> 29:12.618
He's cute.

29:14.327 --> 29:15.327
Really?

29:15.328 --> 29:17.909
I mean, yeah, I-I guess.

29:17.910 --> 29:19.491
I never really thought about it.

29:19.492 --> 29:20.700
Oh, so you two aren't-

29:20.701 --> 29:22.117
Oh, no, no.

29:22.118 --> 29:24.533
Our relationship is
strictly professional.

29:24.534 --> 29:26.201
Hmm.

29:26.202 --> 29:29.075
All right, well,
shall we regroup

29:29.076 --> 29:30.825
and talk about the party?

29:30.826 --> 29:31.534
Absolutely.

29:31.534 --> 29:32.534
Right this way.

29:40.492 --> 29:41.159
Hey.

29:41.159 --> 29:41.868
Hi.

29:41.869 --> 29:43.575
I'm... I'm Kate Clark.

29:43.576 --> 29:44.534
You must be David.

29:44.534 --> 29:45.326
Yes.

29:45.327 --> 29:46.742
Uh, so good to meet you.

29:46.743 --> 29:49.824
Your house is...
it's extraordinary.

29:49.825 --> 29:50.949
Thank you so much.

29:50.950 --> 29:52.325
I bought it five years ago.

29:52.326 --> 29:54.908
Thankfully I was able to make
some architectural changes,

29:54.909 --> 29:56.991
make it feel a little more
my style.

29:56.992 --> 29:58.366
Well, my compliments.

29:58.367 --> 30:01.657
It... it's-it's incredible.

30:01.658 --> 30:02.533
Shall we sit?

30:02.533 --> 30:03.201
Yeah.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.532
Yes.

30:04.533 --> 30:08.074
Uh, okay, so I think we should
start with what we have booked

30:08.075 --> 30:10.074
and what we still need
to set up.

30:10.075 --> 30:13.490
With New Year's being so close,
only five days away,

30:13.491 --> 30:15.908
we're gonna have to make some
quick decisions to be on time.

30:15.909 --> 30:16.783
Ok, sounds good.

30:16.784 --> 30:18.407
Uh, so, what's first?

30:18.408 --> 30:22.324
Well, I've managed to secure
a fantastic rental house

30:22.325 --> 30:25.324
for furniture, cloths, napkins,
et cetera.

30:25.325 --> 30:29.657
So we need to decide on a theme,
the most classic being florals,

30:29.658 --> 30:32.073
gold, silver,
and of course white.

30:32.074 --> 30:33.449
Let's go with gold.

30:33.450 --> 30:35.781
It'll pair nicely with
the existing colour palate.

30:35.782 --> 30:39.741
Absolutely, but may I just make
one suggestion?

30:40.991 --> 30:42.240
Of course.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.489
Maybe we consider going
with a black napkin

30:44.490 --> 30:46.740
so that the gold really pops.

30:46.741 --> 30:50.157
I love that idea.
Thank you, David.

30:50.158 --> 30:52.116
Of course.

30:52.824 --> 30:53.948
Okay. And what would you like
for music?

30:53.949 --> 30:56.073
Would you like a live band
or a DJ?

30:56.074 --> 30:57.656
Oh, a band would be nice.

30:57.657 --> 30:58.574
Okay, great.

30:58.575 --> 30:59.698
We'll make that
our top priority.

30:59.699 --> 31:00.990
A lot of people will already
be booked

31:00.991 --> 31:03.656
but don't worry we will find
you someone great.

31:03.657 --> 31:06.365
Well as long as it's not disco,
I'll be happy.

31:09.157 --> 31:11.198
Well, that seems like a great
place to start.

31:11.199 --> 31:14.031
We're going to go meet
with the caterers now.

31:14.032 --> 31:15.780
Um, out of curiosity,

31:15.781 --> 31:17.573
what's your role gonna be
in all this?

31:17.574 --> 31:21.489
Um... I'm gonna help Mia
spend the week

31:21.490 --> 31:23.739
focusing on getting a florist
and of course, my favourite,

31:23.740 --> 31:25.655
uh, someone to handle
the fireworks.

31:25.656 --> 31:26.822
Sounds great.

31:26.823 --> 31:29.405
Well, just keep me updated
every step of the way.

31:29.406 --> 31:30.822
Here's my card.

31:30.823 --> 31:32.322
My personal cell is on the back.

31:32.323 --> 31:34.405
Call me for anything you need.

31:34.406 --> 31:36.697
Um, thank you so much
for coming.

31:36.698 --> 31:38.823
You can show yourselves out.

31:39.281 --> 31:41.656
Paul? Let's roll some calls.

31:45.489 --> 31:46.822
Wow.

31:46.823 --> 31:47.698
Yeah.

31:47.699 --> 31:48.906
Okay.

31:57.739 --> 32:00.821
Look what I found,
thank goodness.

32:00.822 --> 32:03.488
Flying without a neck pillow
is torture.

32:03.489 --> 32:04.821
Well, how did you find that?

32:04.822 --> 32:07.404
I spent ages looking for it
before you guys got here.

32:07.405 --> 32:10.197
You know your mother,
that's her superpower.

32:10.198 --> 32:12.487
Well, I'm glad you guys came
to see me before you left.

32:12.488 --> 32:14.362
Well, and your place is
on the way to the airport

32:14.363 --> 32:16.071
and dad wanted to save
a few bucks.

32:16.072 --> 32:18.821
Drive here and park the car and
take a cab the rest of the way.

32:18.822 --> 32:20.362
Oh, I see how it is.

32:20.363 --> 32:22.154
Two birds, one stone.

32:22.155 --> 32:23.487
It makes me feel so special.

32:23.488 --> 32:26.487
No, we were always gonna
come and say goodbye in person.

32:26.488 --> 32:27.821
Oh, Lori called me.

32:27.822 --> 32:29.613
Apparently, the doctor said
that Jake will be able to walk

32:29.614 --> 32:31.154
on crutches by
the end of the week.

32:31.155 --> 32:31.988
Well, good then.

32:31.989 --> 32:33.154
He can help you with the party.

32:33.155 --> 32:34.237
Ugh, no.

32:34.238 --> 32:35.571
He can make a couple calls
but he still needs

32:35.572 --> 32:37.529
to get his rest and his friend
David is working out

32:37.530 --> 32:39.112
so I think I'll be fine.

32:39.113 --> 32:40.321
David, hmm?

32:40.322 --> 32:40.821
The car is here.

32:40.822 --> 32:42.237
Oh, okay.

32:42.238 --> 32:43.820
Okay.

32:43.821 --> 32:46.778
Honey, you will call me
if you have

32:46.779 --> 32:49.486
any, any questions
or problems, okay?

32:49.487 --> 32:50.113
Okay.

32:50.113 --> 32:50.863
Promise.

32:50.864 --> 32:52.030
I love you.

32:53.155 --> 32:54.196
We love you, dear.

32:54.197 --> 32:56.029
All right, you relax
and have fun, okay?

32:56.030 --> 32:57.030
Okay.

33:04.738 --> 33:07.862
Hey, got any last-minute
opinions on silverware

33:07.863 --> 33:10.361
that you wanted to get out of
the way before tomorrow?

33:10.362 --> 33:11.445
I knew it.

33:11.446 --> 33:13.278
It bothered you when
I spoke up, didn't it?

33:13.279 --> 33:14.653
I'm just kidding with you.

33:14.654 --> 33:17.653
Okay, well trust me, I was not
trying to step on your toes.

33:17.654 --> 33:18.861
I just wanted to help.

33:18.862 --> 33:21.029
I know. I appreciate it.

33:22.029 --> 33:24.153
So what time are we gonna
start tomorrow?

33:24.154 --> 33:27.236
Uh, how about 8:00 am
at the office?

33:27.237 --> 33:29.153
Sounds good. I'll see
you tomorrow.

33:29.154 --> 33:30.819
Okay. Goodnight, David.

33:30.820 --> 33:32.279
Goodnight, Mia.

33:47.153 --> 33:47.904
Yeah, we can do this.

33:47.905 --> 33:50.861
This is... this is doable.

33:50.862 --> 33:51.902
Yeah.

33:51.903 --> 33:53.277
And since I've never planned
a party before

33:53.278 --> 33:56.235
I have no choice
but to believe you.

33:56.236 --> 33:57.985
Are you ready to go try
some food?

33:57.986 --> 34:00.235
Yeah. Where to first?

34:00.236 --> 34:02.818
The kitchen of our go-to chef
Charlene Powell,

34:02.819 --> 34:06.402
and you will see why she is
our first choice.

34:06.403 --> 34:07.527
Okay.

34:12.444 --> 34:14.610
And these are our duck leg
confit tartlets.

34:14.610 --> 34:17.275
They're easy to prep and as
you know a crowd favourite.

34:17.277 --> 34:18.693
For any gluten-free vegans,

34:18.694 --> 34:21.735
I thought the marinated Portobello
mushroom polenta crisps.

34:21.735 --> 34:23.318
We have the blinis and caviar,

34:23.319 --> 34:25.150
scallops stuffed
with pea shoots,

34:25.152 --> 34:27.275
and the Arancini,
and Heirloom tomatoes

34:27.277 --> 34:29.194
topped with Burrata cheese.

34:31.777 --> 34:33.025
It's delicious.

34:33.027 --> 34:35.443
And what are your thoughts
on a raw bar selection?

34:35.444 --> 34:39.193
Uh, I love that idea but let's
also add a charcuterie bar

34:39.194 --> 34:42.610
with some cheeses, cured
meats just to mix it up.

34:42.610 --> 34:43.402
Will do.

34:43.402 --> 34:45.150
Okay, and finally, for dessert,

34:45.152 --> 34:47.234
we could have a selection
of petit fours

34:47.235 --> 34:49.275
and individual
molten chocolate cake

34:49.277 --> 34:51.400
topped with vanilla bean
ice cream.

34:51.402 --> 34:52.525
I love it.

34:52.525 --> 34:53.984
I'll uh, let the client know
and get her approval

34:53.985 --> 34:55.984
and get back to you tomorrow
morning, if that's okay?

34:55.985 --> 34:56.818
Sounds like a plan.

34:56.819 --> 34:57.902
Thanks again.

35:03.651 --> 35:04.276
What's wrong?

35:04.276 --> 35:04.985
Do you not like it?

35:04.986 --> 35:06.817
No, no, I-I liked it.

35:06.818 --> 35:09.317
It was all-it was all good.

35:09.318 --> 35:12.400
It was all safe and familiar.

35:12.401 --> 35:14.108
It's exactly what people
are expecting

35:14.109 --> 35:15.442
at a New Year's Eve party.

35:15.443 --> 35:18.358
Okay Gordon Ramsay,
what's your great idea?

35:18.359 --> 35:19.525
Well, you said it yourself.

35:19.526 --> 35:22.192
You've worked with her
a dozen times, right?

35:22.193 --> 35:27.025
Don't you wanna explore
something new?

35:27.026 --> 35:28.401
I'm listening.

35:32.984 --> 35:35.816
Okay, so I know it's somewhere
on this block.

35:35.817 --> 35:37.318
Well, maybe you
were imagining it.

35:38.358 --> 35:40.858
I never just imagine
good Chinese food.

35:40.859 --> 35:43.274
Well, I hope not,
because this little excursion

35:43.275 --> 35:45.441
is costing us valuable
prep time.

35:45.442 --> 35:46.442
Hey, trust me, okay?

35:46.443 --> 35:50.316
We're close, I can smell it.

35:50.317 --> 35:53.232
Oh, there it is.

35:53.233 --> 35:54.859
Come on.

35:55.983 --> 35:57.150
After you.

36:00.650 --> 36:04.065
Okay, I have to admit it,
this is pretty good.

36:04.066 --> 36:04.900
Yes!

36:04.901 --> 36:07.192
Oh. Uh, excuse me.

36:13.900 --> 36:15.316
Where did you pick that up?

36:15.317 --> 36:17.481
Ah, I started learning
a few months ago.

36:17.482 --> 36:20.315
Getting ready for the trip
to China for the documentary.

36:20.316 --> 36:24.315
I'm not fluent but I know how
to ask for more.

36:24.316 --> 36:27.190
Does it ever get lonely
travelling by yourself?

36:27.191 --> 36:28.815
Eh, I find ways to make friends.

36:28.816 --> 36:31.690
A smile does a lot
of the work for you.

36:31.691 --> 36:33.940
I really believe that
if you have an open mind

36:33.941 --> 36:35.231
and an open heart

36:35.232 --> 36:37.857
you can pretty much connect
with anyone.

36:37.858 --> 36:40.939
Isn't it hard not being with
your family for the holidays?

36:40.940 --> 36:42.939
They live in Arizona
so I do get to see them

36:42.940 --> 36:44.523
two or three times a year.

36:44.524 --> 36:47.981
So it's not all that bad.

36:47.982 --> 36:51.564
But enough about me,
what about you?

36:51.565 --> 36:53.023
What about me?

36:53.024 --> 36:54.814
Well, uh, we didn't get
to finish our conversation

36:54.815 --> 36:56.023
the other night.

36:56.024 --> 36:57.856
I'm still curious why you think
the ship has sailed

36:57.857 --> 36:59.647
on you making movies.

36:59.648 --> 37:02.023
Well, the reality is that Jake
wants to take

37:02.024 --> 37:04.148
Pearson Party Planners
to the next level

37:04.149 --> 37:09.314
and with mom and dad retiring
he needs me to make it work.

37:09.315 --> 37:12.814
I can't just walk out on him.

37:12.815 --> 37:14.980
It sounds like you spend a lot
of time thinking about

37:14.981 --> 37:16.147
what they need

37:16.148 --> 37:19.856
and not enough time thinking
about what you need.

37:19.857 --> 37:23.397
David, no offence but you've
been travelling the world

37:23.398 --> 37:26.647
and living your dream
since you left college.

37:26.648 --> 37:29.980
Your family hasn't relied on you
the way my family relies on me.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.564
You're right.

37:31.565 --> 37:34.439
Forgive me, that... that...
that came across selfish

37:34.440 --> 37:36.439
and that was not my intention.

37:36.440 --> 37:40.189
But more importantly,
what's the verdict on the food?

37:40.190 --> 37:43.147
Okay, well it's certainly
a different direction

37:43.148 --> 37:46.313
and it is delicious...

37:46.314 --> 37:48.730
but my concern is that
not everyone will like it.

37:48.731 --> 37:49.855
Are you kidding me?

37:49.856 --> 37:51.980
Who's not gonna like this?

37:51.981 --> 37:53.396
Oh, excuse me?

37:53.397 --> 37:57.021
Do you-do you guys do catering?

37:57.022 --> 37:58.062
Let me ask the owner.

37:58.063 --> 37:59.605
Okay.

37:59.606 --> 38:00.189
David.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.479
It's worth asking.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.771
I seriously think if you
hire these guys,

38:04.772 --> 38:06.730
Kate's guests will never
forget it.

38:08.647 --> 38:09.230
Hi.

38:09.231 --> 38:10.438
Hi.

38:10.439 --> 38:12.479
Uh, my friend and I are planning
a New Year's Eve party

38:12.480 --> 38:14.812
and we were wondering
if you cater.

38:14.813 --> 38:19.062
It would be roughly
100 people or so.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.770
Unfortunately, not.

38:20.771 --> 38:22.937
We only have the staff
and facilities to handle

38:22.938 --> 38:25.062
a party half that size.

38:25.063 --> 38:27.563
Okay, that's good to know.

38:31.396 --> 38:32.938
Thank you.

38:36.605 --> 38:37.896
Well that was fun.

38:37.897 --> 38:39.812
You got any more hidden gems
you want me to hunt down?

38:39.813 --> 38:41.936
I was just trying to get you
out of your comfort zone.

38:41.937 --> 38:43.020
I like my comfort zone.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.770
There are reliable
caterers there.

38:44.771 --> 38:45.771
Okay.

38:46.396 --> 38:48.645
Oh, uh, hold on.

38:48.646 --> 38:51.103
Oh, the United Documentary
Fund wants to meet with me

38:51.104 --> 38:52.312
in an hour.

38:52.313 --> 38:53.271
Oh, no worries.

38:53.272 --> 38:54.520
Um, I'm meeting with Lori later,

38:54.521 --> 38:56.145
she's picking up some stuff
for Jake,

38:56.146 --> 38:57.936
so we can start fresh tomorrow.

38:57.937 --> 38:58.978
Perfect. Sounds good.

38:58.979 --> 39:00.769
Oh, why don't I give you
a ride there?

39:00.770 --> 39:01.896
I like it.

39:07.896 --> 39:09.728
So how is he doing?

39:09.729 --> 39:10.811
Not bad.

39:10.812 --> 39:12.145
He had a check-up
and the doctor said

39:12.146 --> 39:14.061
that the leg is mending nicely.

39:14.062 --> 39:16.644
He's in a little bit of pain
but nothing too serious.

39:16.645 --> 39:17.895
Well, that's a relief.

39:17.896 --> 39:19.019
But, how are you?

39:19.020 --> 39:20.895
Are you managing
everything okay?

39:20.896 --> 39:21.935
It's fine.

39:21.936 --> 39:24.811
David and I sampled
some food vendors today.

39:24.812 --> 39:25.977
How's it going?

39:25.978 --> 39:27.311
You two getting along?

39:27.312 --> 39:28.977
As well as can be expected
for two people

39:28.978 --> 39:31.685
thrown into the deep end
of the pool together.

39:31.686 --> 39:33.643
And are you sinking or swimming?

39:33.644 --> 39:34.894
It's too soon to tell.

39:34.895 --> 39:36.352
We both have very
different styles.

39:36.353 --> 39:37.935
He wants to try all
the different options

39:37.936 --> 39:41.144
before committing and I want
to go with what I know I like

39:41.145 --> 39:42.894
and just make a decision
on the spot.

39:42.895 --> 39:44.269
Sounds a little bit like
a marriage.

39:44.270 --> 39:47.394
Yeah, it kind of is.
Just minus the romance.

39:49.311 --> 39:50.768
What's that look for?

39:50.769 --> 39:51.935
I didn't say a word.

39:51.936 --> 39:53.185
You didn't have to.

39:53.186 --> 39:53.811
Mia.

39:53.812 --> 39:54.894
What?

39:54.895 --> 39:57.852
I think you have a crush
on David.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.143
Lori.

39:59.144 --> 40:00.435
Oh, come on.

40:00.436 --> 40:02.603
That is the most absurd thing
I've ever heard you say.

40:06.728 --> 40:08.893
So, I was thinking
for the centrepiece

40:08.894 --> 40:11.476
we can do a bold assortment of
calla lilies to really put

40:11.477 --> 40:15.809
a pop of colour on every table.

40:15.810 --> 40:17.351
Okay, go on, what do you think?

40:17.352 --> 40:20.809
Look, well I... I... I um...
I'm no expert, okay?

40:20.810 --> 40:23.351
But I do think that
with our gold theme

40:23.352 --> 40:25.143
and with the colour tones
of the house

40:25.144 --> 40:26.976
we should probably stick
with a... I don't know a...

40:26.977 --> 40:32.392
a monochromatic white or an
off-white floral arrangement.

40:32.393 --> 40:33.144
Oh.

40:33.145 --> 40:35.517
Let me... ah, okay.

40:35.518 --> 40:37.142
Okay.

40:37.143 --> 40:39.058
Now hear me out.

40:39.059 --> 40:42.809
What if we went with
a simple white rose

40:42.810 --> 40:46.809
with Queen Anne's lace.

40:46.810 --> 40:48.560
How do you know about
Queen Anne's lace?

40:49.643 --> 40:51.559
Well, my mom used to make
wedding arrangements

40:51.560 --> 40:53.434
in our kitchen for extra money.

40:53.435 --> 40:55.475
I might have picked up
a thing or two.

40:55.476 --> 40:56.601
I guess so.

40:56.602 --> 40:58.017
So, what do you think?

40:58.018 --> 41:00.100
I think you have the right idea
but the wrong flower.

41:00.101 --> 41:01.475
White roses are so overdone.

41:01.476 --> 41:06.725
We should replace it with... ok.

41:06.726 --> 41:08.142
White lisianthus.

41:08.143 --> 41:09.850
Oh.

41:09.851 --> 41:11.142
Okay.

41:11.143 --> 41:14.224
Similar to the white rose
but with a more ruffled petal.

41:14.225 --> 41:15.308
Mm-hmm.

41:15.309 --> 41:17.474
I like it.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.474
But no flower arrangement
is complete

41:19.475 --> 41:22.099
without the perfect vase, right?

41:22.100 --> 41:25.474
And we need that one.

41:25.475 --> 41:27.932
And voila.

41:27.933 --> 41:30.807
I like it.

41:30.808 --> 41:33.559
You sure you two haven't done
this together before?

41:35.601 --> 41:37.141
Okay, so that'll be
our centrepiece,

41:37.142 --> 41:39.558
we'll pick up 20, New Year's
Eve morning.

41:39.559 --> 41:40.682
Okay.

41:40.683 --> 41:43.184
Hey, it was great to meet you.
Thank you.

41:47.892 --> 41:49.183
Jake knows the owner.

41:49.184 --> 41:51.473
He set it up so they would
let us audition bands here

41:51.474 --> 41:52.433
before they open later.

41:52.434 --> 41:53.599
How many bands are we hearing?

41:53.600 --> 41:55.473
Well, our usuals are all
booked solid of course

41:55.474 --> 41:57.223
but I found a few that were
still available.

41:57.224 --> 41:59.807
Great. Oh, um...
I hope it was okay

41:59.808 --> 42:02.265
that I offered my two cents
back there.

42:02.266 --> 42:05.140
As you can see, I waited
until you asked.

42:05.141 --> 42:07.098
David, I don't mind you giving
your opinion.

42:07.099 --> 42:08.849
In fact, I... I want it.

42:08.850 --> 42:11.599
That's why you're here
but maybe just a little...

42:11.600 --> 42:13.806
a little less 'cause we're on
a schedule and...

42:13.807 --> 42:16.348
Understood. A moderate
amount of opinions.

42:16.349 --> 42:17.183
Exactly.

42:17.184 --> 42:18.432
Got it.

42:18.433 --> 42:19.849
Let's go.

42:29.974 --> 42:32.140
What's this band's name again?

42:32.141 --> 42:33.973
Partiovascular.

42:33.974 --> 42:35.472
What?

42:35.473 --> 42:38.141
The band's called
Partiovascular.

42:49.807 --> 42:51.265
Nice.

42:53.140 --> 42:53.973
That was great, guys.

42:53.973 --> 42:54.848
Thank you very much.

42:54.849 --> 42:57.015
Great work, guys. Thank you.

42:58.723 --> 43:02.097
Look, I'm not saying that I was
in love with either of them

43:02.098 --> 43:04.763
but, you know, the first band
probably appeal

43:04.764 --> 43:06.555
to the kind of crowd
Kate's inviting.

43:06.556 --> 43:07.847
I don't know.

43:07.848 --> 43:09.638
I... I agree that neither of
them set the room on fire

43:09.639 --> 43:12.388
but don't you think
the jazz band

43:12.389 --> 43:13.471
would be a little
more appropriate

43:13.472 --> 43:14.847
for a New Year's Eve party?

43:14.848 --> 43:16.847
No, who knows at this point?

43:16.848 --> 43:17.972
I mean, beggars can't
be choosers

43:17.973 --> 43:19.430
and we have to pick
one of them, so...

43:19.431 --> 43:20.431
Yeah.

43:24.806 --> 43:26.054
Hi, Kate.

43:26.055 --> 43:28.221
Yeah, we just finished listening
to some bands at a club

43:28.222 --> 43:29.805
called Sound Check.

43:29.806 --> 43:32.597
I think we've got
some great options.

43:32.598 --> 43:34.054
Oh, really?

43:34.055 --> 43:36.971
That's only a block away.

43:36.972 --> 43:39.597
Ah. Sure.

43:39.598 --> 43:43.430
Okay, we'll see you soon.

43:43.431 --> 43:45.554
I guess we're sticking around.

43:45.555 --> 43:46.804
Yeah.

43:46.805 --> 43:48.388
Kate was having dinner nearby

43:48.389 --> 43:50.929
and she wants to meet us
to go over everything.

43:50.930 --> 43:53.138
Didn't seem like she was gonna
take no for an answer.

43:53.139 --> 43:54.471
Great.

43:54.472 --> 43:57.512
I just-I wish we had another
option to show her, you know?

43:57.513 --> 43:59.305
Yeah.

44:14.805 --> 44:16.137
Come on.

44:16.138 --> 44:17.637
We won't really know
if they're any good

44:17.638 --> 44:19.554
unless we actually dance
to them.

44:19.555 --> 44:21.137
Are you kidding?

44:21.138 --> 44:24.513
Do I look like I'm kidding?

45:02.470 --> 45:04.052
That was great.

45:04.053 --> 45:06.095
You were wonderful.

45:08.512 --> 45:10.053
Okay.

45:16.345 --> 45:17.179
Hey team.

45:17.180 --> 45:18.343
She's here.

45:18.344 --> 45:18.887
Ooh.

45:18.888 --> 45:20.178
Hey there.

45:20.179 --> 45:21.095
They sounded good.

45:21.096 --> 45:22.219
Yeah, yeah.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.177
They- and they are available
on New Year's Eve.

45:24.178 --> 45:25.969
I think that you should hire
them and then we'll get

45:25.970 --> 45:27.969
a DJ to play in
between their sets.

45:27.970 --> 45:30.969
Well, are the other bands
in the running?

45:30.970 --> 45:32.302
Uh, in my opinion, no.

45:32.303 --> 45:33.802
If you'd like to check
them out though

45:33.803 --> 45:35.635
I can get the links to their
websites sent to you.

45:35.636 --> 45:37.468
No, no. That's okay.

45:37.469 --> 45:38.594
I trust you, Mia.

45:38.595 --> 45:40.886
Great. I will let them know.

45:43.303 --> 45:46.051
Woo!

45:46.052 --> 45:46.802
So.

45:46.803 --> 45:48.843
So. How was the rest of the day?

45:48.844 --> 45:50.260
Today was pretty good.

45:50.261 --> 45:52.968
We uh, went to the florist and
we picked out the centrepieces.

45:52.969 --> 45:55.885
Um... you know,
you're very lucky to have

45:55.886 --> 45:57.426
Mia and her company on board.

45:57.427 --> 46:00.177
She... she has such a good eye.

46:00.178 --> 46:04.178
I agree and a smart man
wouldn't let her get away.

46:06.468 --> 46:07.302
Okay.

46:07.303 --> 46:09.176
It's obvious that you like her.

46:09.177 --> 46:11.427
I won't tell anybody that.

46:12.969 --> 46:16.051
No, no, no, we're just friends.

46:17.427 --> 46:19.676
Oh, hey. Uh, how'd it...
how'd it go?

46:19.677 --> 46:22.467
It was great. Uh, they're in.

46:22.468 --> 46:23.135
Yes.

46:23.136 --> 46:25.426
Great find, Mia.

46:25.427 --> 46:28.593
You guys have really put me
at ease about this whole thing.

46:28.594 --> 46:29.925
Well, thank you very much.

46:29.926 --> 46:33.176
And um, on that note I am
actually going to head home

46:33.177 --> 46:35.466
for the night,
return some emails

46:35.467 --> 46:37.717
and get started on
tomorrow's schedule.

46:37.718 --> 46:39.633
Are you sure that
you don't wanna hang?

46:39.634 --> 46:40.675
Oh, no, you guys stay.

46:40.676 --> 46:41.634
You have fun.

46:41.635 --> 46:43.633
I will catch up
with everyone tomorrow.

46:43.634 --> 46:44.301
Goodnight.

46:44.302 --> 46:45.759
Drive safe.

46:53.259 --> 46:54.885
Just give me a second.

46:58.467 --> 46:59.301
Mia!

46:59.302 --> 47:00.383
Hey, Mia!

47:00.384 --> 47:01.883
I just want to check and see
if you're okay.

47:01.884 --> 47:03.216
Yeah, sure. Fine.

47:03.217 --> 47:04.425
Why?

47:04.426 --> 47:06.508
Well, uh, you-you ran out
of there so quickly so I-

47:06.509 --> 47:08.091
No, not at all.

47:08.092 --> 47:09.341
I just want to take care of,
you know,

47:09.342 --> 47:11.425
contracts and the budget.

47:11.426 --> 47:13.008
Not out of the woods yet.

47:13.009 --> 47:14.091
Okay.

47:14.092 --> 47:15.175
Well hey, look,
if you don't want me-

47:15.176 --> 47:18.674
David, it's fine. Stop it.
Go back in.

47:18.675 --> 47:20.799
Don't worry about me.

47:20.800 --> 47:24.757
I'll stop. I'll stop.

47:24.758 --> 47:25.800
Mia...

47:29.300 --> 47:31.966
it was a good day.

47:31.967 --> 47:33.758
Yeah.

47:35.300 --> 47:37.008
Yeah.

47:51.632 --> 47:53.465
Hey Jake, I have you
on speaker with David.

47:53.466 --> 47:55.340
Hey Jake, uh, what's up, buddy?

47:55.341 --> 47:56.424
How're you feeling?

47:56.425 --> 47:58.132
Well, I'm hanging in there.

47:58.133 --> 48:00.673
I'm sorry if I'm not as helpful
as I had hoped.

48:00.674 --> 48:02.215
Oh, no worries,
we just wanted to,

48:02.216 --> 48:03.798
um, let you know where we're at
before we do

48:03.799 --> 48:05.590
the final walk through
the mansion today.

48:05.591 --> 48:08.048
Well, I read the email you sent,
everything looks good,

48:08.049 --> 48:10.256
just make sure you get
the insurance paperwork

48:10.257 --> 48:12.423
from Global Tent
and Party Rentals.

48:12.424 --> 48:13.091
Got it.

48:13.092 --> 48:14.131
Oh, and great news.

48:14.132 --> 48:15.673
Capozzi Fireworks
out of Seattle,

48:15.674 --> 48:17.131
they'll be able to do
the display

48:17.132 --> 48:19.631
and they said they'd be handling
all of the necessary permits.

48:19.632 --> 48:20.756
Great work, Jake.

48:20.757 --> 48:24.839
Guys, uh, Kate is gonna be
blown away.

48:24.840 --> 48:26.465
'Cause of the fireworks.

48:28.465 --> 48:29.714
Get it?

48:29.715 --> 48:33.214
All right, well uh, it's time
for my mid-morning nap.

48:33.215 --> 48:34.881
Good luck today.

48:34.882 --> 48:35.756
Thanks, Jake.

48:35.757 --> 48:36.965
Later, boss.

48:38.299 --> 48:40.714
Okay, uh... I'm starving.

48:40.715 --> 48:42.131
What kind of food do you guys
got around here?

48:42.132 --> 48:44.755
Um, my parents usually
have something back there

48:44.756 --> 48:46.797
but I can't guarantee
it'll be fresh.

48:46.798 --> 48:48.882
Let's see what I can cook up.

48:53.965 --> 48:56.338
Ooh, actually, you have
everything I need

48:56.339 --> 48:58.881
to make one of
my favourite dishes.

48:58.882 --> 49:04.297
Eggs, peppers, tomatoes,
and olive oil.

49:04.298 --> 49:06.463
Huevos Pericos.

49:06.464 --> 49:07.672
Where did you learn how to cook?

49:07.673 --> 49:08.673
My grandmother.

49:08.674 --> 49:10.130
She was from Venezuela.

49:10.131 --> 49:11.630
Um, get this.

49:11.631 --> 49:13.297
Whenever my grandfather
would make her mad

49:13.298 --> 49:15.172
she would, uh, take really
hot chillies

49:15.173 --> 49:16.880
and throw them in his eggs.

49:16.881 --> 49:18.796
Yeah, seriously.

49:18.797 --> 49:23.629
Uh, unfortunately for her
my grandfather is from Texas

49:23.630 --> 49:26.963
and he absolutely loves
everything and anything spicy

49:26.964 --> 49:28.838
so whatever he was doing
to make her mad,

49:28.839 --> 49:29.964
he just kept doing it.

49:31.380 --> 49:35.963
Remind me not to make you mad.

49:35.964 --> 49:38.379
And we cannot forget
the final touch.

49:38.380 --> 49:42.754
A little for you and
a little for me.

49:42.755 --> 49:44.422
Dig in.

49:50.005 --> 49:51.920
Wow.

49:51.921 --> 49:53.629
This is delicious.

49:53.630 --> 49:54.837
Thank you, sir.

49:54.838 --> 49:59.962
Don't thank me, thank my
hot-tempered grandmother.

49:59.963 --> 50:01.503
I just got to ask you, um...

50:01.504 --> 50:03.962
if-if I was able to pull
some strings

50:03.963 --> 50:09.837
and, I don't know, get you a job
on a TV or film production,

50:09.838 --> 50:10.962
would you do it?

50:10.963 --> 50:12.587
Right, because there's a million
jobs for girls

50:12.588 --> 50:15.087
with no experience who work
as party planners.

50:15.088 --> 50:17.170
Okay, first of all, I got to be
honest and say

50:17.171 --> 50:19.503
that Jake did show me your work

50:19.504 --> 50:21.253
and you are better than half
of the people

50:21.254 --> 50:24.086
that I come across
in my industry.

50:24.087 --> 50:25.461
Oh yeah.

50:25.462 --> 50:27.295
Yeah... you... you have... you
have vision, you have passion,

50:27.296 --> 50:29.003
and those are the most
important things.

50:29.004 --> 50:31.628
And... and as good as you are
at party planning

50:31.629 --> 50:35.044
it just doesn't seem like that's
what you wanna do forever.

50:35.045 --> 50:39.253
So, what is really holding
you back?

50:39.254 --> 50:42.420
My parents built this business.

50:42.421 --> 50:44.627
This company kept a roof
over my head,

50:44.628 --> 50:46.752
put me through school.

50:46.753 --> 50:49.128
If I left I'd be
abandoning them.

50:49.129 --> 50:50.961
I'd be abandoning Jake.

50:50.962 --> 50:54.711
Well, I love Jake like
my own brother, ok?

50:54.712 --> 50:57.294
And you know him,
he's a machine.

50:57.295 --> 50:59.252
He'll figure it out.

50:59.253 --> 51:03.460
Come on. Sometimes you just
got to do what's right for you.

51:03.461 --> 51:06.085
Well, some of us are not as
free-spirited and adventurous

51:06.086 --> 51:07.960
as you are.

51:07.961 --> 51:09.169
Okay.

51:09.170 --> 51:11.294
But in... in... in my defence,
I didn't just wake up

51:11.295 --> 51:15.419
and become this, you know,
jet-setting filmmaker.

51:15.420 --> 51:19.252
I'm just kidding, but I was
so lost coming out of college.

51:19.253 --> 51:21.460
I- I didn't know what I wanted
to do.

51:21.461 --> 51:23.793
And I was travelling so much
'cause I had nothing

51:23.794 --> 51:27.793
worth coming home to.

51:27.794 --> 51:29.085
You know, it's crazy.

51:29.086 --> 51:33.960
Had... had I not met that...
that film crew in Thailand

51:33.961 --> 51:38.960
who knows where I'd be today?

51:38.961 --> 51:41.877
Well, as much as I appreciate
your encouragement,

51:41.878 --> 51:43.501
regardless of what
you may think,

51:43.502 --> 51:47.793
I am happy with my life and
we have to focus on the party.

51:47.794 --> 51:48.877
Hey, hey, hey.

51:48.878 --> 51:50.585
I wasn't trying to...

51:50.586 --> 51:52.418
Really, it's fine.

51:52.419 --> 51:54.835
Uh, we... we are gonna be late,
though.

51:59.502 --> 52:01.751
We're gonna be late.

52:25.960 --> 52:28.292
We have Blue Point oysters,
Maine lobster,

52:28.293 --> 52:32.167
and Alaskan King crab legs
being flown in fresh.

52:32.168 --> 52:33.292
Sounds great.

52:33.293 --> 52:34.584
And there's gonna be a tent
set up right here

52:34.585 --> 52:36.208
to cover this entire area.

52:36.209 --> 52:38.584
Scattered tables will be set up
by the end of the day,

52:38.585 --> 52:41.125
you can give your welcome
speech at 9:00 pm,

52:41.126 --> 52:42.375
and then the band
will start playing.

52:42.376 --> 52:43.458
Did you get that?

52:43.459 --> 52:44.749
We'll have a champagne
fountain set up here

52:44.750 --> 52:46.875
with flutes surrounding it
for midnight toasts.

52:46.876 --> 52:49.875
Your band and DJ will be set up
inside right over there

52:49.876 --> 52:52.208
facing outward
and the dance floor

52:52.209 --> 52:53.624
right at the back of the house.

52:53.625 --> 52:57.208
And the DJ will take over for
the band in between their sets

52:57.209 --> 52:58.916
and then at midnight
when the band leaves

52:58.917 --> 53:02.499
the DJ will play until the last
of your guests also leaves.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.624
You asked me to remind
you about the video.

53:04.625 --> 53:05.708
Oh, yes.

53:05.709 --> 53:08.791
And all of this will be captured
on video, right?

53:08.792 --> 53:10.124
Video?

53:10.125 --> 53:13.708
I don't believe I was made aware
that you needed a videographer.

53:13.709 --> 53:15.124
Oh, absolutely.

53:15.125 --> 53:17.291
I want to send out a post-party
email with a link to the video.

53:17.292 --> 53:19.124
Everyone does it these days.

53:19.125 --> 53:19.958
Of course.

53:19.959 --> 53:22.957
We will find someone.

53:22.958 --> 53:24.457
You never say no.

53:24.458 --> 53:26.040
I love that about you.

53:26.041 --> 53:27.832
Ooh, you have a conference call.

53:27.833 --> 53:29.040
Oh, yes.

53:29.041 --> 53:30.582
I'm sorry, I have
to take a call.

53:30.583 --> 53:32.332
I will catch up
with you guys later.

53:32.333 --> 53:32.791
Okay.

53:32.791 --> 53:33.791
Thank you.

53:34.499 --> 53:35.875
Thank you.

53:36.666 --> 53:38.790
Okay, well don't worry
about the video thing.

53:38.791 --> 53:40.874
If we can't find anybody
I don't mind shooting.

53:40.875 --> 53:43.623
I have won a couple of awards.

53:43.624 --> 53:46.373
You and me will have
our hands full.

53:46.374 --> 53:48.707
You know, we'll just shoot
some key moments

53:48.708 --> 53:50.123
and cut it together next week.

53:50.124 --> 53:51.456
Sounds good.

53:51.457 --> 53:52.790
All right, these guys are gonna
need all the help they can get.

53:52.791 --> 53:54.123
Are you ready to get
your hands dirty?

53:54.124 --> 53:55.499
Let's do it. Come on.

54:36.123 --> 54:38.330
Pretty impressive, Miss Pearson.

54:38.331 --> 54:40.872
Why thank you, Mr. Campos.

54:40.873 --> 54:41.789
We're almost there.

54:41.790 --> 54:42.998
Mm.

54:45.290 --> 54:47.038
Okay, fun fact.

54:47.039 --> 54:49.122
Did you know that in Estonia
on New Year's

54:49.123 --> 54:52.122
it is good luck to eat 12 times
before midnight?

54:52.123 --> 54:53.205
Twelve times?

54:53.206 --> 54:54.788
Mm-hmm.

54:54.789 --> 54:55.455
Can't be true.

54:55.456 --> 54:56.663
Oh, so true.

54:56.664 --> 54:58.955
I was working there a few years
back on New Year's Eve

54:58.956 --> 55:02.080
and I actually ate 12 meals.

55:02.081 --> 55:03.372
Well, what happened then?

55:05.539 --> 55:09.288
For starters, I didn't make it
to midnight,

55:09.289 --> 55:13.038
and I ended up in a local
hospital with food poisoning.

55:14.497 --> 55:16.329
You're laughing?

55:16.330 --> 55:18.413
I am-I am expressing
and sharing a moment

55:18.414 --> 55:20.746
where I almost died and you are
just laughing at my misery.

55:20.747 --> 55:21.954
I'm sorry.

55:21.955 --> 55:23.288
No, it's... it's okay.

55:23.289 --> 55:26.414
I will never share any of
my pain with you ever again.

55:28.581 --> 55:29.954
Okay, your turn.

55:29.955 --> 55:31.954
What was your most memorable
New Year's Eve?

55:31.955 --> 55:36.453
Ooh... senior year of college.

55:36.454 --> 55:39.246
My boyfriend had dumped me
earlier in the week

55:39.247 --> 55:41.954
and I wasn't in a very
festive spirit

55:41.955 --> 55:44.829
so I decided not to go to
any of my friends' parties

55:44.830 --> 55:48.328
and to stay home and eat
a quart of ice cream.

55:48.329 --> 55:50.954
That is so sad.

55:50.955 --> 55:53.620
I was heartbroken,
what do you expect?

55:53.621 --> 55:58.370
Anyway, well, 20 minutes to
midnight the doorbell rang.

55:58.371 --> 55:59.121
Oh.

55:59.122 --> 56:00.495
It was my three best friends.

56:00.496 --> 56:02.537
They had left the biggest
party in town

56:02.538 --> 56:04.662
to spend New Year's with me.

56:04.663 --> 56:06.620
And I remember we all went up
to the roof

56:06.621 --> 56:10.036
and watched the fireworks.

56:10.037 --> 56:14.995
We all had a glass each
of really bad champagne

56:14.996 --> 56:16.120
and I still cried that night

56:16.121 --> 56:20.162
but it was because I was
laughing so hard.

56:20.163 --> 56:22.120
It was a year of
new possibilities.

56:22.121 --> 56:23.786
A fresh start.

56:23.787 --> 56:27.079
It made me feel like everything
was going to be okay.

56:35.537 --> 56:36.537
Mia?

56:40.620 --> 56:41.661
I'm so sorry, Mia.

56:41.662 --> 56:42.952
I don't mean to interrupt,

56:42.953 --> 56:46.161
but the decorators are having
some issues out front.

56:46.162 --> 56:48.619
Ah, duty calls.

56:48.620 --> 56:49.828
Thanks.

56:51.953 --> 56:55.952
Okay, let's see these.

56:55.953 --> 56:59.952
So, it sounds like
congratulations may be in order?

56:59.953 --> 57:00.953
For?

57:00.954 --> 57:02.286
Ah.

57:02.287 --> 57:03.827
Yeah, the phone
call from earlier.

57:03.828 --> 57:06.660
I uh, I got the grant.

57:06.661 --> 57:08.618
David, congratulations.

57:08.619 --> 57:10.160
That's fantastic news.

57:10.161 --> 57:12.618
Thanks, guys.

57:12.619 --> 57:16.910
Is it just me or are you not as
excited as I expected you to be?

57:16.911 --> 57:17.661
Oh, no, no.

57:17.661 --> 57:18.452
No, no.

57:18.453 --> 57:19.951
I'm um, I'm stoked.

57:19.952 --> 57:21.993
I just... I'm gonna have to leave
for China a little bit earlier

57:21.994 --> 57:24.535
than planned now, so...

57:24.536 --> 57:26.243
Hey, should we try these on?

57:26.244 --> 57:27.161
Come here.

57:27.162 --> 57:29.826
But that was always the plan,
right?

57:29.827 --> 57:31.951
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it was.

57:31.952 --> 57:34.034
I just... I guess I didn't
expect to, uh, have

57:34.035 --> 57:35.784
such a good time here this week.

57:35.785 --> 57:37.118
Thanks for helping me, David.

57:37.119 --> 57:38.368
I love them.

57:38.369 --> 57:41.450
Ah, yes, you're very welcome.

57:41.451 --> 57:42.534
Come on, Emily.

57:42.535 --> 57:44.535
Let's go take a photo
for grandma and grandpa.

57:47.785 --> 57:49.617
Hey, David, you know
you're welcome to stay here

57:49.618 --> 57:50.618
as long as you like.

57:50.619 --> 57:52.617
We love having you around.

57:52.618 --> 57:53.784
Thank you.

57:53.785 --> 57:56.617
Thank you. I uh, I really
appreciate that, I do.

57:56.618 --> 57:58.033
But I think it's time.

57:58.034 --> 58:01.659
You know, I got to get to China,
start pre-production.

58:01.660 --> 58:02.701
Yeah.

58:02.702 --> 58:04.950
I should probably get going.

58:04.951 --> 58:06.033
I got to go pick up your sister

58:06.034 --> 58:07.617
and then take her
to the mansion, so...

58:07.618 --> 58:08.867
Hey, buddy.

58:08.868 --> 58:10.284
Thank you for all of the hard
work you've done for us

58:10.285 --> 58:11.617
and good luck today.

58:11.618 --> 58:14.117
And call me if you need
anything, all right?

58:14.118 --> 58:15.284
Thanks, man.

58:15.285 --> 58:16.616
Hey, happy New Year.

58:16.617 --> 58:18.368
Right back at ya.

58:24.617 --> 58:26.033
David take off?

58:26.034 --> 58:29.324
Yeah, he went to pick up Mia.

58:29.325 --> 58:31.867
Let me ask you something.

58:31.868 --> 58:33.950
Do you think he's falling
for her?

58:33.951 --> 58:35.199
Well, let me see.

58:35.200 --> 58:39.324
Your sister is single, smart,
beautiful in every way,

58:39.325 --> 58:41.158
shares similar interests
to David,

58:41.159 --> 58:42.283
and for the past five days

58:42.284 --> 58:44.658
they've basically been joined
at the hip.

58:44.659 --> 58:48.741
So yeah, I'd say he's fallen
for her.

58:48.742 --> 58:51.241
Yeah, I shoulda seen it coming.

58:51.242 --> 58:54.116
Relax. They're gonna be fine.

58:54.117 --> 58:55.700
Trust me.

59:03.783 --> 59:04.783
Ooh.

59:04.783 --> 59:05.616
What are you doing?

59:05.617 --> 59:06.740
This is just another work event.

59:06.741 --> 59:07.824
You're acting like you're going
to prom.

59:07.825 --> 59:09.867
This is ridiculous. Stop it.

59:15.158 --> 59:17.866
Hi, David, I'm just running
a little bit late.

59:17.867 --> 59:19.240
No worries. Take your time.

59:19.241 --> 59:20.949
I'm gonna go grab some coffee
on the corner.

59:20.950 --> 59:22.657
Great. That sounds great.

59:22.658 --> 59:24.199
Okay.

59:36.740 --> 59:38.906
I am so sorry.

59:38.907 --> 59:39.866
I'm usually never late.

59:39.867 --> 59:41.614
Don't worry, we got plenty
of time.

59:41.615 --> 59:43.781
Here, enjoy your New Year's
coffee.

59:43.782 --> 59:44.408
Thank you.

59:44.408 --> 59:45.283
You ready for today?

59:45.284 --> 59:46.866
I am indeed.

59:53.116 --> 59:56.614
It's my mom, this'll just
be a minute.

59:56.615 --> 59:57.448
Hi, mom.

59:57.449 --> 59:58.531
Happy New Year's Eve.

59:58.532 --> 59:59.906
Hi. Hi, honey.

59:59.907 --> 01:00:01.948
I'm just calling to check in
and wish you luck for tonight.

01:00:01.949 --> 01:00:02.949
How are things going?

01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:04.114
It's going well.

01:00:04.115 --> 01:00:05.322
You know, a million things
to worry about,

01:00:05.323 --> 01:00:09.114
as usual, but no major hiccups
just yet.

01:00:09.115 --> 01:00:10.031
How about you?

01:00:10.032 --> 01:00:11.739
You and dad enjoying
Palm Springs?

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.531
Yes. Ye-

01:00:13.532 --> 01:00:15.239
Your father wants
to move here now.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.697
Hey, honey!

01:00:16.698 --> 01:00:17.947
Goodness.

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:21.281
In fact, last night he got up
on stage with the band

01:00:21.282 --> 01:00:23.780
at the bar near our place
and sang with them.

01:00:23.781 --> 01:00:25.488
Oh, those poor locals.

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:27.281
But as much fun as we're having
we're really excited

01:00:27.282 --> 01:00:29.281
to come home and see everybody.

01:00:29.282 --> 01:00:30.613
Well, same here.

01:00:30.614 --> 01:00:31.947
Give my love to dad.

01:00:31.948 --> 01:00:32.906
Happy New Year!

01:00:32.907 --> 01:00:34.280
We love you!

01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:36.030
Happy New Year!

01:00:36.031 --> 01:00:36.948
Happy New Year!

01:00:36.948 --> 01:00:37.823
Bye, mom.

01:00:37.824 --> 01:00:39.530
Bye, honey.

01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:40.364
Sorry about that.

01:00:40.365 --> 01:00:42.865
No, no, all good.

01:00:43.489 --> 01:00:45.864
So how we looking today?

01:00:45.865 --> 01:00:47.071
Good.

01:00:47.072 --> 01:00:48.155
Catering just messaged me,
they've added enough food

01:00:48.156 --> 01:00:49.946
for 20 more guests just in case,

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:51.071
especially since Kate decided

01:00:51.072 --> 01:00:52.697
to invite her neighbours
last minute.

01:00:52.698 --> 01:00:54.655
Yep, thank you for the surprise,
Kate.

01:00:54.656 --> 01:00:57.155
Well, it's better to have
leftovers anyway.

01:00:57.156 --> 01:00:58.613
And for the first time
in my career

01:00:58.614 --> 01:01:01.155
I don't have to worry about
the budget, so it's all good.

01:01:01.156 --> 01:01:03.863
Yes, that uh, that works
for me, too.

01:01:03.864 --> 01:01:06.821
I approved the DJ's playlist
and I told all of the staff

01:01:06.822 --> 01:01:10.113
to arrive an hour early
so they miss bridge traffic.

01:01:10.114 --> 01:01:12.404
And... that should be about it.

01:01:12.405 --> 01:01:13.612
Look at you.

01:01:13.613 --> 01:01:16.279
You got all your bases covered.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.445
Before we get started tonight
I wanted to say thank you

01:01:19.446 --> 01:01:23.112
for agreeing to help us-
help me-

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:24.821
you've been incredibly helpful.

01:01:24.822 --> 01:01:28.028
I... I don't know how
completely true that is

01:01:28.029 --> 01:01:30.904
but you are welcome
all the same.

01:01:33.405 --> 01:01:34.612
I got to say, I... I've...

01:01:34.613 --> 01:01:36.445
I've really enjoyed getting
to know you this way.

01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:38.445
It's been fun.

01:01:38.446 --> 01:01:40.280
Same here.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.279
So, you didn't file the permit
with the city?

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.945
This can't be happening.

01:01:53.946 --> 01:01:55.154
What's going on here?

01:01:55.155 --> 01:01:56.278
Why don't you ask him?

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:57.778
He didn't file the paperwork
with the city

01:01:57.779 --> 01:01:59.278
so we won't have
fireworks tonight.

01:01:59.279 --> 01:02:00.403
It's not my fault.

01:02:00.404 --> 01:02:02.611
We-we filled out all
the necessary paperwork

01:02:02.612 --> 01:02:04.278
and received the permit
from the State.

01:02:04.279 --> 01:02:05.778
How was I supposed to know

01:02:05.779 --> 01:02:08.528
we required additional
authorization from the city?

01:02:08.529 --> 01:02:10.403
Okay, will everybody
just calm down.

01:02:10.404 --> 01:02:11.404
This was a mistake.

01:02:11.405 --> 01:02:12.444
I should have cancelled
the party

01:02:12.445 --> 01:02:13.611
when my first planner quit.

01:02:13.612 --> 01:02:15.278
Now I'm gonna be laughed
at by everyone I know.

01:02:15.279 --> 01:02:17.570
I have never had a problem
with permits before.

01:02:17.571 --> 01:02:19.444
He didn't do his job.
You better hope that I-

01:02:19.445 --> 01:02:20.529
Okay, enough!

01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:25.070
Kate, if you please.

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:29.861
Kate.

01:02:29.862 --> 01:02:32.402
You called us a week away
from New Year's Eve

01:02:32.403 --> 01:02:33.652
to ask for our help.

01:02:33.653 --> 01:02:36.069
Anybody else would have
said no to this gig

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:38.318
and I am using my every
waking breath

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:39.819
to make sure that this party
is something

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:44.527
all of your guests love, but
I need you to calm down,

01:02:44.528 --> 01:02:45.944
to stop making everyone crazy,

01:02:45.945 --> 01:02:48.402
and to go inside and get ready
for your party

01:02:48.403 --> 01:02:50.026
so I can fix this problem.

01:02:50.027 --> 01:02:52.652
Okay?

01:02:52.653 --> 01:02:54.319
Fine.

01:02:55.444 --> 01:02:56.736
Paul?

01:02:58.944 --> 01:03:00.610
Hey, Capozzi.

01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:02.943
Finish setting up the fireworks.

01:03:02.944 --> 01:03:05.860
David, come with me.

01:03:05.861 --> 01:03:07.944
Yes ma'am.

01:03:10.694 --> 01:03:15.277
Okay, so... what now, boss?

01:03:15.278 --> 01:03:19.236
We go visit the one person with
enough power to save this party.

01:03:33.694 --> 01:03:34.776
Hello, Mia.

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:36.234
Uh, what a surprise.

01:03:36.235 --> 01:03:38.276
Uh, it's nice to see you again,
Mrs. Morgan.

01:03:38.277 --> 01:03:39.775
Um, this is my friend, David.

01:03:39.776 --> 01:03:40.817
Nice to meet you, David.

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:41.569
Nice to meet you.

01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:42.569
Come in, come in.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:43.901
Thank you.

01:03:45.235 --> 01:03:47.775
So, what brings you out here?

01:03:47.776 --> 01:03:49.151
Uh, we're planning a party
at the moment

01:03:49.152 --> 01:03:50.650
and we're having a little
bit of trouble

01:03:50.651 --> 01:03:52.151
with the fireworks permit.

01:03:52.152 --> 01:03:56.984
Uh, let me guess, you need
to speak to my husband.

01:03:56.985 --> 01:03:59.484
Come on, he's in his office.

01:04:01.442 --> 01:04:05.191
Remember, we're being picked
up at 4:00.

01:04:05.192 --> 01:04:05.776
Okay.

01:04:05.776 --> 01:04:06.317
Nice to meet you.

01:04:06.318 --> 01:04:07.609
Yeah.

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:10.650
Well, I have to tell you,
attending four parties in a row

01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:14.941
on New Year's Eve is not exactly
my idea of a good time.

01:04:14.942 --> 01:04:17.316
You're the mayor,
can't you just pick one?

01:04:17.317 --> 01:04:18.608
I wish.

01:04:18.609 --> 01:04:21.275
Unfortunately, each party is
more work related than social,

01:04:21.276 --> 01:04:25.483
which I imagine is also
the nature of your visit.

01:04:25.484 --> 01:04:26.858
Uh, yes, sir.

01:04:26.859 --> 01:04:31.607
Um... well, I'm-I'm involved in
the party at Kate Clark's place?

01:04:31.608 --> 01:04:32.401
Ah, yes.

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:33.941
We were invited to that as well.

01:04:33.942 --> 01:04:35.233
Our fireworks vendor,

01:04:35.234 --> 01:04:38.066
he secured a permit
from the State

01:04:38.067 --> 01:04:39.524
but he didn't realize he had
to get a permit

01:04:39.525 --> 01:04:42.066
from your office, as well.

01:04:42.067 --> 01:04:43.232
That's unfortunate, Mia,

01:04:43.233 --> 01:04:45.024
but your parents are well aware
of the rules

01:04:45.025 --> 01:04:46.941
regarding local pyrotechnics.

01:04:46.942 --> 01:04:49.691
I know my father usually handles
this sort of thing

01:04:49.692 --> 01:04:51.774
but my parents just retired
and they're vacationing

01:04:51.775 --> 01:04:54.774
in Palm Springs and
my brother's broken his leg

01:04:54.775 --> 01:04:55.775
and is out of commission

01:04:55.776 --> 01:04:57.898
so I have to handle this one
on my own.

01:04:57.899 --> 01:05:00.940
Ah, I'm truly sorry, but if
I bend the rules for you

01:05:00.941 --> 01:05:03.566
it could easily come back
to haunt me later.

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.566
I just can't take that risk,

01:05:05.567 --> 01:05:09.274
especially not in
an election year.

01:05:09.275 --> 01:05:12.731
Hey, these-these photos
are beautiful.

01:05:12.732 --> 01:05:13.857
Especially these over here.

01:05:13.858 --> 01:05:15.399
They-they look very familiar.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.107
By any chance were these
taken in Wamba?

01:05:19.108 --> 01:05:20.773
Actually, they were.

01:05:20.774 --> 01:05:22.606
I was there a few years ago
with a charity

01:05:22.607 --> 01:05:24.940
that builds schools in Kenya.

01:05:24.941 --> 01:05:25.941
Have you been?

01:05:25.942 --> 01:05:27.189
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.773
I uh, I... I spent 18 months
there working with the uh,

01:05:28.774 --> 01:05:32.356
Endangered Wildlife
Foundation of Africa.

01:05:32.357 --> 01:05:34.148
Ah, that's a great cause.

01:05:34.149 --> 01:05:35.857
You know what else
is a good cause?

01:05:35.858 --> 01:05:38.398
Keeping the largest business
owner in Seaford happy

01:05:38.399 --> 01:05:42.772
on New Year's and
on election year.

01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:46.357
Please, Mayor Morgan,
we need your help.

01:05:57.648 --> 01:06:01.106
This will be a one-time
only favour, Mia.

01:06:01.107 --> 01:06:02.689
And you have to keep
this between us.

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:03.439
I promise.

01:06:03.439 --> 01:06:04.439
Of course.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.481
Okay. Let's do this.

01:06:11.481 --> 01:06:13.063
Well, that went better
than expected.

01:06:13.064 --> 01:06:15.022
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:06:21.481 --> 01:06:24.939
I got to say, for a minute there
I thought it was hopeless.

01:06:25.772 --> 01:06:27.980
I got to say, I think you and I

01:06:27.981 --> 01:06:29.771
worked pretty well together
in there.

01:06:29.772 --> 01:06:31.938
Let's not pat ourselves
on the backs just yet.

01:06:31.939 --> 01:06:33.604
We still have a whole party
to throw

01:06:33.605 --> 01:06:36.647
and only three hours
to get it done.

01:06:49.522 --> 01:06:50.813
Yeah, I mean, for
the most part we're,

01:06:50.814 --> 01:06:51.814
uh, pretty good.

01:06:51.815 --> 01:06:54.062
How's the leg?

01:06:54.063 --> 01:06:55.187
That's good to hear.

01:06:55.188 --> 01:06:57.229
All right, well thanks
for checking in, Jake.

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:59.021
Talk to you later.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:02.688
Very nice.

01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:05.604
Thanks. You clean up pretty
good yourself.

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:07.770
Just the two people
I was looking for.

01:07:07.771 --> 01:07:10.437
So, it turns out we may
have a problem.

01:07:10.438 --> 01:07:13.146
Ms. Clark has let me know that
the head count has increased

01:07:13.147 --> 01:07:15.062
and she requested
that we continue serving

01:07:15.063 --> 01:07:18.854
an hour past midnight,
which we did not plan for.

01:07:18.855 --> 01:07:20.062
Okay, we'll figure
something out,

01:07:20.063 --> 01:07:21.271
you get back to prepping.

01:07:21.272 --> 01:07:22.646
Okay.

01:07:24.147 --> 01:07:26.937
That's not good.

01:07:26.938 --> 01:07:27.604
Wait.

01:07:27.605 --> 01:07:29.478
What're you thinking?

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:31.062
Why don't you call
that Chinese restaurant

01:07:31.063 --> 01:07:32.895
and see if they can help us out?

01:07:32.896 --> 01:07:34.354
That's a good idea.

01:07:35.354 --> 01:07:36.354
Oh, the band has just arrived.

01:07:36.354 --> 01:07:37.187
I'm gonna help them set up.

01:07:37.188 --> 01:07:39.062
I'll take care of the food.

01:07:44.854 --> 01:07:45.646
Hey, guys.

01:07:45.646 --> 01:07:46.604
Welcome.

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:48.103
Your stage is gonna
be right in there,

01:07:48.104 --> 01:07:49.186
so you can set up.

01:07:49.187 --> 01:07:50.854
Thanks again, Mia.

01:07:52.937 --> 01:07:54.979
Ok, so I need you to check on...

01:07:57.603 --> 01:08:00.270
Oh, no!

01:08:00.271 --> 01:08:01.686
It's okay.

01:08:01.687 --> 01:08:02.520
It's fine.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.436
It was my fault.

01:08:03.437 --> 01:08:07.311
Keep doing what you were doing.

01:08:08.603 --> 01:08:10.227
It's fine.

01:08:10.228 --> 01:08:12.728
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

01:08:15.603 --> 01:08:19.102
Yeah, I'm gonna need
75 pieces of Ho Ga.

01:08:19.103 --> 01:08:19.895
Mm-hmm.

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:22.394
And 75 more of Char Siu Bao.

01:08:22.395 --> 01:08:23.103
And I'm also gonna-

01:08:23.103 --> 01:08:23.812
David?

01:08:23.812 --> 01:08:24.770
Oh, hold on.

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:25.852
Sorry, but have you seen
Mia anywhere?

01:08:25.853 --> 01:08:26.977
Uh, last time I saw her
she was headed

01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:28.435
through the back room
through the foyer.

01:08:28.435 --> 01:08:29.893
Okay. Thanks.

01:08:29.894 --> 01:08:32.852
Sorry, uh, I'm gonna have
somebody come pick it up.

01:08:32.853 --> 01:08:33.685
Okay.

01:08:33.687 --> 01:08:35.435
Happy New Year.

01:08:38.644 --> 01:08:39.894
Okay.

01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:41.769
Mia?

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:45.269
Mia, it's Kate.

01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:47.935
Are you in there?

01:08:47.935 --> 01:08:49.310
I really-

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.350
Oh, I knew we were going
for a gold theme tonight

01:08:52.352 --> 01:08:54.184
but that's a little much,
don't you think?

01:08:54.185 --> 01:08:57.852
I had a run-in with a tray
of gold paint.

01:08:57.853 --> 01:08:59.810
I can see that.

01:09:01.935 --> 01:09:03.435
Come on.

01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:04.475
Where are we going?

01:09:04.477 --> 01:09:05.810
I can't exactly have
my party planner

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:10.268
walking around like
an Oscar statue, can I?

01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:12.185
Let's get you changed.

01:09:13.768 --> 01:09:15.434
Um, Kate, I'm really sorry
about earlier.

01:09:15.435 --> 01:09:18.975
Oh, don't worry, it's fine.

01:09:18.977 --> 01:09:20.767
But I mean I wouldn't usually-

01:09:20.768 --> 01:09:23.100
Mia, it's fine.

01:09:23.102 --> 01:09:25.600
I was out of line and you
took control of the situation.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.559
It's exactly what
I would have done.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.684
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

01:09:28.685 --> 01:09:31.268
I thought you were gonna
fire me on the spot.

01:09:34.893 --> 01:09:36.600
I'm not sure if you know this

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.767
but I grew up with four
older brothers.

01:09:38.768 --> 01:09:40.934
My late father groomed
each of them to follow

01:09:40.935 --> 01:09:44.809
in the family business while
he bought me horses to ride.

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:48.725
I think he loved me very much
but he didn't really know me.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:51.933
So eventually I took my life
into my own hands

01:09:51.934 --> 01:09:53.600
and got an MBA.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.766
A few years later I launched
my first company.

01:09:57.767 --> 01:09:59.100
That's incredible.

01:09:59.101 --> 01:10:01.309
I wish I had that confidence.

01:10:02.851 --> 01:10:07.267
Confidence comes from stepping
outside your comfort zone.

01:10:07.268 --> 01:10:09.183
Once you take a leap of faith

01:10:09.184 --> 01:10:12.766
you'll find yourself
where you wanna be.

01:10:12.767 --> 01:10:15.933
Sounds like something David
would say.

01:10:15.934 --> 01:10:19.100
Speaking of David...

01:10:19.101 --> 01:10:21.432
when are you two gonna
get together?

01:10:21.433 --> 01:10:24.599
And don't give me
that surprised look.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.015
I won't pretend that there
isn't something between us

01:10:27.016 --> 01:10:30.266
but David's first love is his
work and wherever in the world

01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:32.558
that takes him and I don't
think he has room

01:10:32.559 --> 01:10:37.057
for anything else right now.

01:10:37.058 --> 01:10:39.307
Well, it's New Year's Eve.

01:10:39.308 --> 01:10:42.932
Anything could happen.

01:10:42.933 --> 01:10:43.933
Put this on.

01:10:43.934 --> 01:10:45.266
Oh. Okay.

01:10:45.267 --> 01:10:47.850
Put those on, and those.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:50.932
And this.

01:10:50.933 --> 01:10:53.723
Help yourself to all my make-up
and hair products

01:10:53.724 --> 01:10:55.890
and I will meet you downstairs.

01:10:55.891 --> 01:10:57.391
Kate.

01:10:58.975 --> 01:11:00.849
Thank you.

01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:02.265
You're welcome.

01:11:02.266 --> 01:11:03.932
Now hurry up.

01:11:03.933 --> 01:11:06.099
We've got a party to throw.

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:45.932
Hey, has uh, has anyone
seen Mia?

01:12:03.973 --> 01:12:05.514
Wow.

01:12:05.515 --> 01:12:09.305
You... you look incredible.

01:12:09.306 --> 01:12:10.429
Thanks.

01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:11.763
Uh, you don't think
it's too much?

01:12:11.764 --> 01:12:12.888
No.

01:12:12.889 --> 01:12:18.263
No, I, uh... I wouldn't change
a thing.

01:12:18.264 --> 01:12:20.097
So, how's it been going
down here?

01:12:20.098 --> 01:12:22.263
Oh, well I've got some good news
and some bad news.

01:12:22.264 --> 01:12:23.721
Uh, the good news is
the Chinese restaurant's

01:12:23.722 --> 01:12:27.221
having a slow night so they
will absolutely help us out

01:12:27.222 --> 01:12:28.638
with the extra food.

01:12:28.639 --> 01:12:32.555
The bad news is they have
no one to deliver it to us.

01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:35.513
Well, Jake's place is
half a mile from there.

01:12:35.514 --> 01:12:37.346
Lori could drive one
of the company vans.

01:12:37.347 --> 01:12:38.762
She wouldn't have
to do anything.

01:12:38.763 --> 01:12:41.096
The restaurant staff could load
the van and then our staff

01:12:41.097 --> 01:12:43.720
could unload it, she would
just have to drive.

01:12:43.721 --> 01:12:46.721
Okay. I mean, it
couldn't hurt to ask.

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:52.428
The party's in an hour and... I
think we're gonna pull this off.

01:12:52.429 --> 01:12:54.805
I got to say, I think
you're right.

01:13:01.429 --> 01:13:05.680
Of course.

01:13:14.096 --> 01:13:15.804
How's everything looking
down here?

01:13:15.805 --> 01:13:18.387
Well, we overloaded
the electrical system.

01:13:18.388 --> 01:13:19.595
I'm trying to get us
on the generator

01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:23.179
but I can't find the manual
override switch.

01:13:27.346 --> 01:13:28.263
Found it.

01:13:28.264 --> 01:13:29.803
Yes, you did.

01:13:29.804 --> 01:13:32.011
Oh, wait. Hang on.

01:13:32.012 --> 01:13:33.761
Sorry. Thank you.

01:13:33.762 --> 01:13:35.762
Can't take you anywhere.

01:13:39.179 --> 01:13:39.887
The party.

01:13:39.887 --> 01:13:40.554
Yeah.

01:13:40.554 --> 01:13:41.428
After you.

01:13:41.429 --> 01:13:43.138
Thanks.

01:14:11.053 --> 01:14:13.552
Lovely to see you.

01:14:13.553 --> 01:14:14.760
For you, Ms. Clark.

01:14:14.761 --> 01:14:16.428
Thank you, Paul.

01:14:17.761 --> 01:14:20.845
Bryan, so nice to see you.

01:14:24.178 --> 01:14:25.760
So, uh, two questions.

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:28.718
Is that extra food coming and
do you have any extra staff

01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:30.010
you could spare to help us?

01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:32.760
Four of my servers didn't make
it because of traffic.

01:14:32.761 --> 01:14:36.218
I will check on the food
but unfortunately, we're uh...

01:14:36.219 --> 01:14:39.926
a little thin on staff but
I will see what I can do.

01:14:39.927 --> 01:14:41.635
Okay. Let me know if you
hear anything.

01:14:41.636 --> 01:14:43.469
Absolutely.

01:14:48.635 --> 01:14:49.759
David.

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.093
I've been looking for you.

01:14:51.094 --> 01:14:52.426
What're you up to?

01:14:52.427 --> 01:14:54.009
I'm waiting for the van because
Lori's coming with the food.

01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:55.343
Well, she better get here soon.

01:14:55.344 --> 01:14:56.592
The guests are eating up a storm

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:59.261
and Charlene just told me
that she's understaffed.

01:15:03.052 --> 01:15:06.759
What could you possibly
be smiling about right now?

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.260
Come here.

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:15.218
What is this?

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:16.884
Mom? Dad?

01:15:16.885 --> 01:15:17.552
Look at you.

01:15:17.553 --> 01:15:20.634
You look stunning.

01:15:20.635 --> 01:15:22.259
Well, we understand
you need a little help,

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:23.093
is that true?

01:15:23.094 --> 01:15:24.259
Fair warning, we're not cheap.

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.093
But I don't understand.

01:15:25.094 --> 01:15:26.758
How are you even here?

01:15:26.759 --> 01:15:29.175
Well, we talked to you
and then we talked to Jake

01:15:29.176 --> 01:15:30.800
and then we were wanting
to be with you

01:15:30.801 --> 01:15:32.259
on New Year's Eve, so...

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.300
It wasn't until we landed
that your brother found out

01:15:34.301 --> 01:15:35.967
that you might need
a few extra hands,

01:15:35.968 --> 01:15:37.050
so here we are.

01:15:37.051 --> 01:15:38.092
It's true.

01:15:38.093 --> 01:15:39.550
Lori filled me in
on the food situation.

01:15:39.551 --> 01:15:42.675
I called Charlene and she told
me about the lack of staff.

01:15:42.676 --> 01:15:44.883
We know that you can do this
on your own

01:15:44.884 --> 01:15:48.633
but while we're here you might
as well put us to work.

01:15:48.634 --> 01:15:50.092
We're your family.

01:15:50.093 --> 01:15:51.093
No matter where we are,

01:15:51.094 --> 01:15:53.341
we're here for you, honey.

01:15:53.342 --> 01:15:56.383
I love you guys.

01:15:56.384 --> 01:16:00.174
Ok, um, mom, dad, Charlene
definitely needs you

01:16:00.175 --> 01:16:03.258
immediately in the food tent,
it's right out back.

01:16:03.259 --> 01:16:04.924
Lori, why don't you find some
of the catering staff

01:16:04.925 --> 01:16:06.716
and get them to help you unload
the Chinese food

01:16:06.717 --> 01:16:07.634
you just brought?

01:16:07.634 --> 01:16:08.634
Ok.

01:16:08.635 --> 01:16:10.258
And Jake, should you even
be on that?!

01:16:10.259 --> 01:16:12.091
Well, I'm limited in what
I can do physically

01:16:12.092 --> 01:16:14.424
but I can always schmooze.

01:16:14.425 --> 01:16:16.590
All right, you get inside
and you start schmoozing.

01:16:16.591 --> 01:16:18.424
All right.

01:16:18.425 --> 01:16:20.092
Be careful.

01:16:23.925 --> 01:16:26.924
And you had nothing to do
with this?

01:16:26.925 --> 01:16:28.883
My lips are sealed.

01:16:36.424 --> 01:16:38.341
Okay.

01:16:45.758 --> 01:16:46.881
Oh, speak of the devil.

01:16:46.882 --> 01:16:48.382
This is my sister, Mia,
I was telling you about.

01:16:48.383 --> 01:16:50.090
She's the real hero of
the evening.

01:16:50.091 --> 01:16:51.215
Happy New Year.

01:16:51.216 --> 01:16:53.550
Happy New Year!
Have a great night!

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:56.756
So how is networking going?

01:16:56.757 --> 01:16:58.090
Do you need more business cards?

01:16:58.091 --> 01:17:00.589
Very funny, but I actually
did run out.

01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:02.714
I'm not even kidding.

01:17:02.715 --> 01:17:06.257
Mia, this is all because of you.

01:17:06.258 --> 01:17:07.548
You did this.

01:17:07.549 --> 01:17:09.006
Oh, come on.

01:17:09.007 --> 01:17:10.090
You helped, too.

01:17:10.091 --> 01:17:11.422
You made a couple phone calls,
didn't you?

01:17:11.423 --> 01:17:12.756
No, I'm being serious.

01:17:12.757 --> 01:17:15.965
You made this whole night happen
without me or mom or dad,

01:17:15.966 --> 01:17:18.881
and I think it's gonna take
this company to the next level.

01:17:18.882 --> 01:17:21.089
Well, this was
an important night

01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:24.880
and I didn't wanna
let you guys down, and...

01:17:24.881 --> 01:17:27.464
Yeah?

01:17:27.465 --> 01:17:31.298
And I wanted to leave the
company in a good position.

01:17:34.756 --> 01:17:38.339
This is your last party,
isn't it?

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:41.922
Jake, this has been an
incredible week for me.

01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:45.256
It's helped me realize what I-
what I want in life

01:17:45.257 --> 01:17:48.880
and I feel like I have to follow
my heart and move on.

01:17:48.881 --> 01:17:51.255
I hope you understand.

01:17:51.256 --> 01:17:53.213
Of course, I do.

01:17:53.214 --> 01:17:56.755
I'm just surprised it took you
this long to tell me.

01:17:56.756 --> 01:17:57.631
Really?

01:17:57.632 --> 01:17:59.588
Yeah, really.

01:17:59.589 --> 01:18:02.880
Look, I... I love how we've
all been able to work

01:18:02.881 --> 01:18:05.421
so well together as a family
all of these years,

01:18:05.422 --> 01:18:07.922
but it's mostly because of you.

01:18:09.047 --> 01:18:11.088
Stop it. You'll make me cry.

01:18:11.089 --> 01:18:17.754
Look... I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

01:18:17.755 --> 01:18:21.046
you go follow that dream.

01:18:21.047 --> 01:18:22.047
I'm gonna be fine.

01:18:22.048 --> 01:18:24.420
Pearson Party Planners
is gonna live on

01:18:24.421 --> 01:18:26.588
even with just one remaining
band member.

01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:35.004
Hey, it's almost midnight.

01:18:35.005 --> 01:18:37.463
Don't you have someone
you should be with?

01:18:49.463 --> 01:18:50.296
Hey.

01:18:50.297 --> 01:18:52.420
Hey.

01:18:52.421 --> 01:18:53.962
Thank you.

01:18:53.963 --> 01:18:57.087
I... I guess you pulled it off,
huh?

01:18:57.088 --> 01:19:00.420
I'll be happier
after it's midnight.

01:19:00.421 --> 01:19:02.129
Hey, did you see Jake?

01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:03.545
He broke his leg
less than a week ago

01:19:03.546 --> 01:19:05.129
and he's still
out there hustling.

01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:07.628
Even a broken leg can't keep
that guy down.

01:19:07.629 --> 01:19:09.212
Oh, no, no.

01:19:09.213 --> 01:19:09.921
Cheers.

01:19:09.922 --> 01:19:11.213
Cheers.

01:19:14.587 --> 01:19:17.045
So good to see you.

01:19:17.046 --> 01:19:19.586
You know, I've been thinking
about something.

01:19:19.587 --> 01:19:21.044
I'm listening.

01:19:21.045 --> 01:19:24.628
Well, I came here, you know,
to get money for my film,

01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:26.753
and the plan was for me to get
on a plane afterwards

01:19:26.754 --> 01:19:32.253
and fly to some faraway place
like I always do.

01:19:32.254 --> 01:19:34.170
But then I met you.

01:19:35.962 --> 01:19:41.836
Something's changed in me and...
nothing else matters anymore.

01:19:41.837 --> 01:19:45.585
All I ever think about is you.

01:19:45.586 --> 01:19:47.627
What do you think about this?

01:19:47.628 --> 01:19:53.752
Okay, if you want to stay here,
I'm gonna stay here with you.

01:19:53.753 --> 01:19:55.419
But if you wanna come
to China with me

01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:01.544
we can make a film together and
have the adventure of our lives.

01:20:01.545 --> 01:20:04.794
It's funny.

01:20:04.795 --> 01:20:06.085
When you got here,

01:20:06.086 --> 01:20:09.001
I thought to myself how am I
going to spend a whole week

01:20:09.002 --> 01:20:12.418
with this guy?

01:20:12.419 --> 01:20:15.502
But now I, um...

01:20:15.503 --> 01:20:18.085
I can't imagine my life
without you.

01:20:18.086 --> 01:20:22.669
So, if you're asking me if
I'm ready to follow my dreams...

01:20:24.336 --> 01:20:25.668
six, five, four...

01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:26.876
I'm in.

01:20:26.877 --> 01:20:28.584
Three, two, one!

01:20:28.585 --> 01:20:30.584
Happy New Year everybody!

01:20:30.585 --> 01:20:32.460
Happy New Year, Mia.
