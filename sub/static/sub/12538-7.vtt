WEBVTT

00:03.232 --> 00:04.985
Previously on Rogue...

00:04.996 --> 00:07.283
You want me to go talk to Alec Laszlo

00:07.724 --> 00:10.381
- and ask him for police information?
- That's correct.

00:10.416 --> 00:13.484
You think you can fit a remote access
Trojan to a two-gig thumb drive?

00:13.519 --> 00:16.588
- Are you gonna bug their computer?
- Gotta get those boys their murder files.

00:16.622 --> 00:19.924
It cost me a lot to get these files.

00:20.207 --> 00:22.993
- Hmm. Back up.
- Okay! We're up!

00:24.308 --> 00:27.280
- What did he just do?
- He deleted the report

00:27.300 --> 00:30.535
about those garage CCTV
cameras breaking his alibi.

00:30.603 --> 00:32.302
His friends don't know he's lying.

00:32.338 --> 00:35.923
He's always lying to his friends for other
reasons, doing a little business on the side.

00:35.963 --> 00:38.610
Hey! Why do you keep coming around here?

00:38.633 --> 00:41.150
- This is definitely not Massoud.
- Okay, who the fuck is this Massoud?

00:41.205 --> 00:41.823
Hey.

00:41.943 --> 00:43.882
You need to get up here.

00:43.916 --> 00:45.197
Then what happened?

00:45.317 --> 00:48.419
He just starts asking for the rest of the
money. He starts asking for Massoud's money.

00:48.454 --> 00:49.664
He said Massoud?

00:49.784 --> 00:51.456
- Okay, go.
- Yeah.

00:51.490 --> 00:53.825
Why don't you move your
families, put them in a hotel?

00:53.859 --> 00:55.486
Downtown, somewhere safe.

00:56.938 --> 00:58.527
Please stop.

00:58.764 --> 01:00.870
Come on, don't be such a kid.

01:01.145 --> 01:02.667
Stop!

Smile, motherfucker.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.990
Ray! What are you doing?

01:59.692 --> 02:00.992
Ray!

02:01.510 --> 02:03.060
Ray!

02:04.363 --> 02:05.964
Hey, come on, man, get moving.

02:05.998 --> 02:07.699
Hey, what's going on?

02:14.740 --> 02:16.958
What's wrong? What's going on?

02:17.480 --> 02:18.879
What is that?

02:20.045 --> 02:21.721
- Ray, what is that?
- Hey.

02:40.278 --> 02:44.459
Are you sure this is a... a good idea?

02:44.687 --> 02:48.812
I am not losing another operative.
Now, get up there and check on her.

02:49.074 --> 02:50.641
Okay, um...

02:51.227 --> 02:53.605
What do I say?

02:54.195 --> 02:57.648
You're a Quantico trained field agent.
You can't deliver a fucking pizza?

03:21.395 --> 03:23.430
No, you really killed this.

03:27.846 --> 03:29.414
This is dead.

03:30.421 --> 03:31.916
Just leave it.

03:33.085 --> 03:35.620
Whoa. Is that necessary?

03:36.655 --> 03:38.748
You'll be glad I have it
if our friends show up.

03:38.803 --> 03:42.045
Okay. What kind of friends
are we talking about?

03:42.165 --> 03:43.756
The wrong guys, loan sharks.

03:49.101 --> 03:50.735
And how deep in the hole are you?

03:50.828 --> 03:53.078
Well, enough for them to
want to make an example of us.

03:53.125 --> 03:56.174
I never saw any of the money,
so why they got a beef with me?

03:56.408 --> 03:58.209
Because they think you're with me.

04:00.550 --> 04:04.215
- Did you tell 'em that?
- No. They have pictures of us together.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.431
- They've been watching us.
- Great.

04:07.537 --> 04:09.151
Let's go.

04:09.751 --> 04:11.355
Let's go.

04:19.930 --> 04:21.466
1204.

04:27.026 --> 04:29.161
Calimani's pizza.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.880
Over there.

05:27.579 --> 05:29.099
Damn.

05:38.110 --> 05:39.661
I think we got it wrong.

05:40.228 --> 05:41.770
What do you mean?

05:41.780 --> 05:44.515
- I think we're safe.
- You think? Or you know, Ray?

05:44.550 --> 05:46.484
I'm at the office. We need to talk.

05:46.518 --> 05:48.514
All right. I'll see you in a second.

05:52.257 --> 05:54.842
You should go home. That was
Ray. Some things have changed.

05:55.959 --> 05:58.162
- Are we safe?
- Yeah, I think so.

05:58.197 --> 06:01.933
- I'll call you when I know something.
- No, you can't dick me around like this.

06:01.967 --> 06:03.601
Is there a target on my back or not?

06:03.635 --> 06:05.937
I said I'll call you when I know something.

06:21.119 --> 06:23.988
So you don't think he
spilled the wine on purpose?

06:24.323 --> 06:25.723
I didn't see it.

06:26.158 --> 06:27.458
Shit.

06:27.710 --> 06:31.210
Look, he was nervous, and his bags were
packed, he wanted to get out of there.

06:31.318 --> 06:34.821
- It could've been an accident.
- Why was he leaving? Where was he going?

06:34.941 --> 06:36.717
Some cabin two hours north.

06:36.969 --> 06:39.170
And he said that loan
sharks were after him.

06:40.105 --> 06:42.295
Do you think this is the Massoud
they've been talking about?

06:42.342 --> 06:44.079
You know what, I think
it's a bunch of crap.

06:44.109 --> 06:47.645
Why would loan sharks be doling out
flagged bills from the government?

06:47.846 --> 06:50.381
Whoever they're afraid
of, it's not loan sharks.

06:52.251 --> 06:54.852
Did he say anything else?

06:55.220 --> 06:58.889
Ray called and then two minutes later,
he's telling me everything's fine.

07:00.292 --> 07:01.826
Let's get a tail on him.

07:02.127 --> 07:04.829
I think he's going back to
Excelsior, we can listen in there.

07:04.916 --> 07:07.652
- All the microphones are dead.
- What?

07:07.833 --> 07:09.448
Since when? When did that happen?

07:09.735 --> 07:12.503
- Since Spud died two nights ago.
- Shit.

07:14.746 --> 07:16.899
I've never seen him like that.

07:17.476 --> 07:19.275
I think we're close to something.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.168
Really close.

07:23.903 --> 07:25.632
He didn't make me, Leni.

07:40.622 --> 07:42.199
Jesus Christ.

07:42.319 --> 07:43.942
I know.

07:44.363 --> 07:45.933
He's a student.

07:46.677 --> 07:49.777
What if this is his cover? Maybe
his family doesn't even know.

07:49.777 --> 07:52.518
- That's what I thought.
- And now?

07:52.788 --> 07:55.339
Spud said the guy flew in
from Pakistan two weeks ago.

07:55.366 --> 07:56.747
That guy...

07:57.349 --> 08:00.262
That guy's a grad
student at USF. Spud lied.

08:02.894 --> 08:07.121
I've been turning it over and over in my
mind, why would he lie? Why about that?

08:09.428 --> 08:11.128
He was covering something up.

08:11.997 --> 08:14.699
- You think that Spud is capable of...
- Killing Cheat?

08:17.202 --> 08:18.502
He loved him.

08:18.622 --> 08:21.433
Yeah, but he never forgave him
for what happened over there.

08:24.418 --> 08:27.011
So he poisons him? Come on, Ray.

08:27.126 --> 08:29.447
He gave Kendra bad drugs
to party with Cheat.

08:29.524 --> 08:31.932
She doesn't partake. He
has to tie up loose ends.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.207
What about this kid?

08:33.235 --> 08:35.823
He needed us to believe Massoud's
men were coming after us.

08:36.701 --> 08:38.590
There's no way. There's no way.

08:38.724 --> 08:40.091
You got a better version?

08:41.804 --> 08:43.302
Let's hear it. Go ahead.

08:43.339 --> 08:45.362
Because right now, I want
to wring his fucking neck.

08:45.396 --> 08:46.698
Hold on, hold on.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.158
Listen to me.

08:49.698 --> 08:51.408
We need to be sure, Ray.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.997
Once we say it,

08:53.997 --> 08:56.137
there's no coming back. And you know it.

09:02.314 --> 09:04.323
He'll be wondering where we are.

09:07.889 --> 09:09.854
Okay. Call him.

09:24.372 --> 09:26.359
Hey, where are you guys? Did you get lost?

09:26.864 --> 09:28.164
Hey, listen,

09:28.373 --> 09:30.007
Alice is running a really bad fever.

09:30.041 --> 09:32.949
Donna wants to give her the night.
We're gonna be up there tomorrow.

09:33.012 --> 09:35.745
I'm sorry, man, must be something she ate.

09:35.778 --> 09:37.047
How are things up there?

09:37.115 --> 09:39.051
Yeah. Yeah, they're great. Uh...

09:39.271 --> 09:40.723
Where's Ethan?

09:40.919 --> 09:43.220
He's with us. Safer to travel together.

09:43.853 --> 09:45.355
Right.

09:45.691 --> 09:48.793
Well, I'm sorry that
she's sick, man. That's...

09:49.588 --> 09:51.094
Poor kid.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.264
What a day, huh?

09:53.298 --> 09:54.665
Yeah, that's for sure.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.868
Stay safe, man. See you tomorrow.

09:57.903 --> 09:59.375
Yeah, you got it, man.

10:05.255 --> 10:07.121
I should call the boy's mother.

10:07.241 --> 10:09.389
See what kind of confirmation we can get.

10:11.721 --> 10:14.318
We need to see her,
look in her fucking eyes.

10:14.383 --> 10:15.683
Well, it's late.

10:15.804 --> 10:17.988
We'll do it first thing
in the morning, 0800.

10:18.023 --> 10:19.404
I'll get an address.

10:23.428 --> 10:25.029
Right now, I'm going home.

10:26.849 --> 10:29.954
- Give my girls a kiss.
- I'll see you then.

10:48.085 --> 10:49.553
Fuck off.

10:52.704 --> 10:54.391
Hey!

11:01.600 --> 11:04.091
Hey, cool down. Remember where you are.

11:04.302 --> 11:05.870
Fuck you, Grace.

11:08.907 --> 11:10.274
Remember where you are.

11:10.308 --> 11:11.608
Fuck you, Grace.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.093
Fuck you, Grace.

11:31.897 --> 11:34.202
Mmm. You're looking perky.

11:34.229 --> 11:36.306
Heavy night?

11:36.544 --> 11:38.119
Black, two sugars.

11:39.169 --> 11:41.372
So I got your text yesterday.

11:42.490 --> 11:44.118
What was it this time, Mother?

11:44.238 --> 11:45.426
We out of soya milk?

11:45.450 --> 11:48.032
I don't know what you're talking
about. I didn't send a text.

11:50.282 --> 11:52.016
Would you know if you even did?

11:52.825 --> 11:55.213
I think I prefer it when you're not around.

11:55.554 --> 11:58.029
Oh, and there I was thinking
we had nothing in common.

11:59.786 --> 12:02.643
- Evie?
- She just left for school.

12:02.961 --> 12:05.494
It's not even 7:30. Evie!

12:05.805 --> 12:07.431
What did I just say?

12:08.667 --> 12:10.501
Hey, it's Evie. Leave a message.

12:10.644 --> 12:12.311
Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

12:13.186 --> 12:15.205
Did you send me a text yesterday?

12:16.524 --> 12:18.019
I, uh...

12:19.122 --> 12:20.513
Will you just call me?

12:20.813 --> 12:23.479
Um... I just want to know
that you're all right.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.276
Love you.

12:27.261 --> 12:30.802
You're supposed to be looking out
for her. That's why you're here.

12:30.922 --> 12:33.564
If you smother her, she'll just pull away.

12:34.924 --> 12:36.509
You're guessing, obviously.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.044
I ran Ethan's photo through
the Minute Rides database.

12:46.137 --> 12:49.403
He has multiple accounts under
different aliases. But here's the thing.

12:49.851 --> 12:51.571
The night of Cheat's murder,

12:51.955 --> 12:54.288
he took a car to Carson City.

12:55.925 --> 12:57.745
Holy shit.

12:57.781 --> 13:00.214
Which means he didn't kill Sarah.

13:01.286 --> 13:04.388
And we've we been chasing
the wrong guy the whole time?

13:04.952 --> 13:07.001
Just because he wasn't physically there

13:07.028 --> 13:08.821
does not mean he wasn't involved.

13:09.694 --> 13:12.997
So why is he lying to his friends
about going to Carson City?

13:14.748 --> 13:16.685
Gambling problem?

13:17.538 --> 13:20.868
Not according to the GPS
coordinates from the company.

13:20.905 --> 13:23.077
They have him visiting this house

13:23.197 --> 13:25.084
in the suburbs.

13:25.510 --> 13:28.121
That's four hours from here.

13:28.752 --> 13:30.708
I can be there by lunchtime.

13:31.383 --> 13:33.961
No, you can't go and talk to
them. What if they know Ethan?

13:34.081 --> 13:35.749
It'll blow your cover.

13:36.755 --> 13:39.965
- I don't think you should go on your own.
- Okay, let's go.

13:45.874 --> 13:48.627
You have reached Ethan
Kelly. Please leave a message.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.313
Where are you? You should have
been here 15 minutes ago. Call me.

14:16.828 --> 14:18.783
- Jason?
- Yes.

14:19.001 --> 14:20.582
Come in. Come in.

14:20.765 --> 14:22.166
Thank you.

14:39.614 --> 14:41.553
How're you doing, Mrs. Benowitz?

14:41.673 --> 14:43.629
This must be very hard for you.

14:44.196 --> 14:45.812
Have you seen him?

14:46.483 --> 14:47.984
Have you talked to him?

14:48.733 --> 14:50.529
No, not for a few days.

14:50.900 --> 14:53.068
It doesn't make any sense.

14:53.098 --> 14:55.071
Well, if there's anything I can do...

14:56.901 --> 14:58.736
How do you know Amir?

14:59.809 --> 15:04.308
You look a little old to be a student.

15:04.505 --> 15:05.955
Oh, I'm not.

15:06.075 --> 15:07.364
We're friends.

15:09.214 --> 15:11.582
What are the police saying?
Do they have any leads?

15:11.639 --> 15:15.052
They, they... they won't
even say he's missing. They...

15:15.086 --> 15:17.265
they're not taking it seriously.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.687
I'm sure they know what they're doing.

15:18.807 --> 15:20.480
I know my boy.

15:20.744 --> 15:22.212
I know my boy.

15:22.775 --> 15:25.457
And he calls me every day.

15:26.910 --> 15:30.434
I'm wondering if there's some place
he might have gone? Does he have...

15:31.469 --> 15:34.191
you know, family somewhere else?

15:34.839 --> 15:36.757
No. No.

15:37.275 --> 15:40.177
He... he... he grew up here.

15:40.868 --> 15:42.503
I mean, I have

15:42.537 --> 15:44.883
- a brother in Be'er Sheva.
- Be'er Sheva?

15:45.606 --> 15:47.215
Israel.

15:50.179 --> 15:51.721
Look...

15:52.857 --> 15:55.826
Are you friends with Amir or

15:56.133 --> 15:58.529
friends with Amir?

15:59.481 --> 16:01.281
What?

16:02.051 --> 16:04.750
Oh. No, friends. Just...

16:05.107 --> 16:06.735
Just friends.

16:06.771 --> 16:09.232
It is none of my business.

16:16.274 --> 16:18.798
We'll find him, Mrs. Benowitz.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.445
We'll find him.

16:37.941 --> 16:40.575
You have reached Ethan
Kelly. Please leave a message.

16:40.724 --> 16:43.090
Where the fuck are you, man? You
need to call me back right now.

16:43.110 --> 16:44.778
This is not looking good.

16:50.233 --> 16:52.994
- Hey, bud.
- Hey, how's Alice?

16:53.644 --> 16:57.339
Yeah, all good. The temperature's
back down. She's fine, thanks.

16:57.722 --> 16:59.982
Good, good. So, you guys are on your way?

17:00.458 --> 17:03.723
Yeah, just putting the last few things
together. You need us to bring anything?

17:03.821 --> 17:05.321
No, just get here.

17:06.101 --> 17:07.804
All right. See you soon.

17:10.253 --> 17:13.837
Hi. They're coming. They're
gonna come. They're all coming.

17:42.998 --> 17:44.533
What do you want?

17:44.588 --> 17:45.568
I'm looking for Alec.

17:45.586 --> 17:48.220
I stopped by his office. Lloyd said
I might be able to find him here.

17:48.473 --> 17:50.616
Well, he ain't here. Who are you?

17:51.110 --> 17:52.575
I'm just a friend.

17:52.894 --> 17:54.228
And you are?

17:54.458 --> 17:55.967
A wife.

17:55.980 --> 17:57.481
Alec doesn't have friends.

17:57.982 --> 17:59.323
He owe you money?

17:59.443 --> 18:01.207
No, no, nothing like that,

18:01.230 --> 18:03.921
I just had a few questions
about a woman that he knows.

18:04.122 --> 18:05.863
Wanna be a little more specific?

18:05.983 --> 18:07.061
Yeah.

18:08.341 --> 18:09.983
You know who that is?

18:11.882 --> 18:13.738
Yeah. We know the bitch.

18:21.823 --> 18:23.840
She's a fucking cop.

18:26.708 --> 18:28.180
Oh, yeah?

18:29.799 --> 18:32.182
- You sure about that?
- Of course I'm sure.

18:33.385 --> 18:35.652
She killed Alec's brother
and got away with it.

18:35.726 --> 18:38.527
Fucked her way into his dad's
business and left us in the shit.

18:40.459 --> 18:42.336
Well, you don't seem to be doing so badly.

18:42.361 --> 18:44.494
I got a husband who didn't
come home last night,

18:44.529 --> 18:48.173
I'm about to get evicted, and it takes
two of these to get me through breakfast.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.167
So don't tell me how I'm doing.

18:50.442 --> 18:51.557
Okay.

18:53.030 --> 18:54.838
What do you want with her anyway?

18:56.036 --> 18:57.658
She playing you, too?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.946
Take care.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.640
- Hello.
- Mrs. Hicks?

19:32.377 --> 19:34.544
I'm with the Carson City Police Department.

19:34.579 --> 19:37.113
And I was wondering if I could
have a moment of your time.

19:37.734 --> 19:39.335
Is this about the tree?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.332
I'm sorry?

19:42.558 --> 19:45.255
Uh, no. No, it is not about the tree.

19:46.157 --> 19:47.677
We're looking into a person of interest

19:47.692 --> 19:50.222
that's been identified as
having been in your neighborhood.

19:50.725 --> 19:52.229
Prowler?

19:56.034 --> 19:57.701
Do you recognize this man?

20:00.128 --> 20:01.820
Ginny?

20:02.908 --> 20:04.706
Ginny.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.133
Do we recognize this man?

20:10.052 --> 20:12.398
No, Mum. We don't.

20:12.732 --> 20:14.551
No?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.521
Okay.

20:18.056 --> 20:20.387
Thank you for your time.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.135
You get anything?

20:32.770 --> 20:35.354
- Not sure.
- What do you mean?

20:39.902 --> 20:41.894
I recognize that guy.

20:42.680 --> 20:43.980
How?

20:44.969 --> 20:48.318
Listen, anything you can
tell us would really help.

20:50.045 --> 20:52.089
Will we have to give our money back?

20:53.923 --> 20:55.959
- What's your name?
- Ginny.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.414
Ginny, if you tell us what you know,

20:58.534 --> 21:00.463
you'll be helping a lot of people.

21:00.665 --> 21:02.833
And I promise you, you
don't need to be afraid.

21:07.472 --> 21:09.341
That guy, in the picture,

21:09.567 --> 21:12.395
I don't know who he is, but
he's been leaving us cash.

21:12.910 --> 21:15.812
Five grand, every month for the past year.

21:15.947 --> 21:17.581
Sometimes 10.

21:17.701 --> 21:20.117
We get packages at night and stuff.

21:21.244 --> 21:23.056
Do you have any idea why?

21:23.411 --> 21:25.731
I figure it has something
to do with my brother.

21:25.865 --> 21:27.200
Your brother?

21:27.858 --> 21:30.494
- Think we could talk to him?
- I doubt it.

21:31.162 --> 21:32.496
He's dead.

21:34.014 --> 21:35.732
Hey, I'm sorry.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.269
You mind me asking how he died?

21:40.171 --> 21:41.638
Afghanistan.

21:42.006 --> 21:43.707
Helicopter crash.

21:44.976 --> 21:46.270
Was he shot down?

21:46.390 --> 21:48.895
No. He was going on leave.

21:49.213 --> 21:52.231
The chopper had some kind
of mechanical failure.

21:55.911 --> 21:57.621
Do you have a photo?

21:57.922 --> 21:59.723
Yeah, sure.

22:02.633 --> 22:04.535
It's all I've got left.

22:04.829 --> 22:06.696
I keep it with me everywhere I go.

22:08.295 --> 22:09.999
Wayne Hicks?

22:10.196 --> 22:11.991
Special Ops, huh?

22:12.069 --> 22:13.078
Yeah,

22:13.407 --> 22:15.264
mom was pretty proud of that.

22:15.730 --> 22:18.742
Until all they sent us
back was his stuff in a bag.

22:20.157 --> 22:21.786
Thank you, Ginny.

22:21.906 --> 22:23.416
Thank you.

22:28.535 --> 22:30.787
We hired her because
she had no credibility.

22:30.955 --> 22:33.557
You know, unfortunately,
there was a reason for it.

22:34.225 --> 22:35.859
Reinstate her.

22:36.260 --> 22:39.477
- I'm sorry?
- This is a clandestine operation, Elliot.

22:39.597 --> 22:42.232
Last thing we need is
to bring someone else in.

22:42.776 --> 22:44.000
It's already done.

22:44.035 --> 22:45.802
Well un-do it. You're supposed to be

22:45.836 --> 22:47.304
controlling her, not firing her.

22:47.338 --> 22:50.573
How can I control her when you've
had me hamstrung from the beginning?

22:50.846 --> 22:53.025
Well, If you can't handle your authority...

22:53.080 --> 22:55.289
I have no authority because
they know I'm lying to them.

22:55.314 --> 22:59.316
All agents work on operations where
they're not privy to certain information.

22:59.350 --> 23:01.654
That's why we have
clearance levels, Elliot.

23:01.953 --> 23:04.287
And how high does my clearance have
to be before you tell me why this

23:04.322 --> 23:06.289
task force was set up in the first place?

23:06.538 --> 23:10.148
You keep asking questions like
that and you'll never get there.

23:10.312 --> 23:12.546
The bureau didn't instigate
this operation, did they?

23:12.890 --> 23:14.366
I'm going to stop you right there.

23:14.413 --> 23:16.891
God dammit, who am I really working for?

23:16.937 --> 23:18.693
CIA? Pentagon?

23:18.736 --> 23:20.737
Whose ass am I covering?
Because I sure as shit know

23:20.771 --> 23:24.490
this isn't about us tracking down some
money sent to Afghanistan for reconstruction.

23:26.410 --> 23:30.113
As far as I've seen, Elliot,
you don't know anything for sure.

23:30.381 --> 23:33.236
So get in line, do your job, a

23:33.291 --> 23:35.986
Nd find out how those boys
ended up with that money.

23:37.187 --> 23:41.240
Oh, Elliot, go make nice with Kastner,

23:41.826 --> 23:43.636
I hear that's what you're good at.

24:38.322 --> 24:40.494
- Hey, where have you been?
- I'm sorry, Ray.

24:40.548 --> 24:42.786
What? You don't answer the calls?

24:42.867 --> 24:44.801
You don't show at the meet. Where were you?

24:45.189 --> 24:48.792
Look, I woke up this
morning and couldn't move.

24:50.328 --> 24:52.544
I guess there's a part of me that just

24:52.664 --> 24:54.346
doesn't want to know.

24:57.931 --> 24:59.569
Yeah.

25:02.614 --> 25:04.489
I guess I know how you feel.

25:06.114 --> 25:08.482
Right. Give me the news.

25:09.738 --> 25:11.230
It wasn't a cover.

25:11.515 --> 25:13.817
That kid we buried, Spud's assassin.

25:14.695 --> 25:17.137
- He wasn't working for Massoud.
- And you're sure?

25:17.148 --> 25:19.689
Yeah, of course I'm sure. His mother
asked me if I was his boyfriend.

25:19.714 --> 25:21.555
Does that sound like the Taliban to you?

25:21.675 --> 25:24.519
Spud faked a hit on himself
to throw us off the scent.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.539
- You know it and I know it.
- No, that still doesn't make sense.

25:26.569 --> 25:28.871
Come on, it makes $2.5 million
of sense, and you know what?

25:28.905 --> 25:30.967
Why don't you quit pretending you
haven't already thought about that...

25:31.001 --> 25:34.337
- Spud was never about the money.
- In the end, everybody's about the money.

25:38.622 --> 25:40.217
We were.

25:44.082 --> 25:45.353
OK.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.307
- We talk to him.
- No, fuck that.

25:48.085 --> 25:50.146
We get Cheat's money back
from him, I'm done with him.

25:50.171 --> 25:52.269
We give him a chance to explain.

25:52.668 --> 25:53.968
He deserves it.

25:54.959 --> 25:56.740
We talk to him first, Ray.

25:57.025 --> 25:58.721
You hear me?

26:00.016 --> 26:01.765
Understand?

26:06.409 --> 26:08.666
Yeah, okay.

26:09.039 --> 26:10.339
Good.

26:30.528 --> 26:33.587
You really think Spud's capable of that?

26:33.707 --> 26:34.913
Spud?

26:37.062 --> 26:39.932
I think you never really know anyone.

26:42.211 --> 26:43.867
Connie know?

26:45.486 --> 26:48.611
Connie doesn't know much
past People magazine. Come on.

26:51.292 --> 26:52.435
Why?

26:53.990 --> 26:56.567
Why would he do it?

26:58.070 --> 27:00.877
Well, that's the $2.5 million question.

27:02.223 --> 27:04.582
- What?
- Cheat's money is missing.

27:04.862 --> 27:06.192
I told you,

27:06.192 --> 27:07.757
I always said,

27:07.775 --> 27:09.741
you and Ethan should have kept the money.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.165
- I knew you couldn't trust the other two.
- Yeah.

27:17.408 --> 27:18.808
You have to get it back.

27:25.115 --> 27:27.562
Look, Ethan's waiting
outside in the car, all right?

27:27.602 --> 27:29.752
I need you to stay here with the
girls. We'll be back tomorrow.

27:29.787 --> 27:32.218
No, like hell! No, we're coming with you.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.596
Absolutely not. We don't
know what Spud is capable of.

27:34.625 --> 27:37.441
Ray, If you two show up without us,

27:37.459 --> 27:39.215
he'll make a run for it.

27:40.011 --> 27:41.809
We're coming with you.

27:51.275 --> 27:56.993
Cpl. Wayne Hicks. Born June,
13th, 1985 in Carson City, Nevada.

27:57.281 --> 28:00.259
Died September 5th, 2013, when his Chinook

28:00.286 --> 28:03.599
failed mechanically over
Jalalabad, Afghanistan.

28:03.685 --> 28:05.749
- Twenty-two dead.
- Yeah.

28:05.984 --> 28:07.146
A word?

28:07.723 --> 28:09.085
Grace?

28:18.826 --> 28:20.905
You found my replacement yet?

28:21.450 --> 28:23.782
Yeah. Yeah, got a couple of names.

28:24.139 --> 28:26.243
Lucero, Bland,

28:26.363 --> 28:27.916
maybe O'Dell.

28:28.602 --> 28:30.761
Lucero won't work outside of Washington.

28:30.770 --> 28:33.203
Bland barely lives up to his name,

28:33.551 --> 28:35.654
and there is a reason
O'Dell's always available

28:35.672 --> 28:37.081
after she fell off that motorcycle.

28:37.201 --> 28:40.437
- At least I can trust them.
- You can trust me, you just didn't.

28:41.267 --> 28:43.299
Don't tell me you weren't
after my job from the start.

28:43.327 --> 28:46.195
Oh, come on. Everybody
is after everyone's job.

28:53.170 --> 28:55.683
If I keep you around are
you going to get on board?

28:58.565 --> 29:00.623
If I stick around,

29:00.743 --> 29:02.626
are you going to have my back?

29:07.181 --> 29:08.952
What'd you find in Carson City?

29:10.400 --> 29:12.222
Dead end.

29:15.038 --> 29:16.759
All right.

29:18.121 --> 29:19.963
Keep going.

29:47.682 --> 29:51.825
Who's that? Huh? Who's that? Who's that?

29:52.730 --> 29:54.364
Huh? Who is this?

29:55.465 --> 29:56.866
Who's that?

29:57.934 --> 29:59.511
All right, buddy.

29:59.958 --> 30:01.994
- Hey, thought you guys would never get here.
- Uncle Spud!

30:02.114 --> 30:03.836
Hey!

30:03.956 --> 30:05.945
- How you feeling?
- Huh?

30:06.065 --> 30:10.290
She's fine. You know how resilient
little kids are, they bounce right back.

30:10.314 --> 30:11.881
- How was the drive up?
- It was good. It was fine.

30:11.909 --> 30:12.705
- It was good?
- Yeah.

30:12.732 --> 30:15.110
- I was worried about you.
- You don't have to worry about us.

30:15.167 --> 30:17.452
- Can you help me with the bags?
- Yeah.

30:19.623 --> 30:20.923
Whoa!

30:25.593 --> 30:28.965
No, honey, that was April's christening.

30:29.030 --> 30:31.065
Yeah, it was April's, you're right.

30:33.224 --> 30:35.838
Actually, I think that's
the first time we met.

30:36.173 --> 30:39.475
You were so shy. She was so shy.

30:39.510 --> 30:40.950
I don't think you said
five words all night.

30:40.996 --> 30:43.594
- I was nervous. Please.
- Nervous about what?

30:43.714 --> 30:45.148
He proposed two weeks later.

30:45.182 --> 30:49.252
Yeah, and if I had known then what I
know now, I never would have said yes.

30:49.286 --> 30:51.230
Hey, what is that supposed to mean?

30:51.255 --> 30:53.782
It's because he was
already married to you guys.

30:53.809 --> 30:54.797
Hoo-rah.

30:54.816 --> 30:56.829
Who was the girl that you
brought to the wedding?

30:56.829 --> 30:58.648
That skinny thing. What was her name?

30:59.271 --> 31:00.652
What was her name?

31:07.671 --> 31:09.138
I'd like to make a toast.

31:09.173 --> 31:12.608
Everyone in the world that
I love is at this table.

31:13.319 --> 31:14.782
And...

31:14.902 --> 31:17.453
just to have us here together,

31:18.552 --> 31:19.919
safe...

31:22.365 --> 31:26.453
You guys aren't the family that I was
born into, but you're the family that I...

31:26.851 --> 31:28.950
That I found along the way. And...

31:29.774 --> 31:32.005
And that's the best kind of family.

31:33.970 --> 31:36.843
And I love you guys very much.

31:38.755 --> 31:41.069
Who's been feeding this guy wine? Connie?

31:42.172 --> 31:44.208
No, no, no. I want him to drink more.

31:44.245 --> 31:46.590
Can't I just be happy for once?

31:46.710 --> 31:48.544
- Can I be happy for once?
- To absent friends.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.614
To absent friends.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.406
Where's daddy? Where's daddy?

32:07.464 --> 32:09.665
Where's your daddy? Where's Daddy?

32:09.699 --> 32:11.267
There he is!

32:18.669 --> 32:20.890
What time did Evie say she was coming home?

32:21.010 --> 32:23.379
Oh, she's eating at a friend's tonight.

32:23.580 --> 32:26.854
- What? Why didn't you tell me?
- You didn't ask.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.515
Oh, none for me thanks.

32:33.635 --> 32:35.134
I'm having a white day.

32:35.459 --> 32:38.015
- I'm sorry?
- It's the latest thing.

32:38.228 --> 32:39.990
You just eat white food.

32:40.110 --> 32:42.954
-  It's supposed to be very purifying.
- Jesus Christ.

32:52.146 --> 32:54.881
Oh. Hey, Billy. Come on in.

32:55.324 --> 32:57.814
- There's plenty of food.
- Hi, Billy.

32:58.004 --> 32:59.438
Is Evie here?

33:00.029 --> 33:03.265
No. Is everything all right?

33:03.587 --> 33:05.864
She's not returning my calls.

33:06.330 --> 33:08.790
- Did something happen?
- No, nothing.

33:09.293 --> 33:11.260
Then why isn't she returning your calls?

33:11.295 --> 33:14.168
- Stop interrogating the poor kid.
- It's okay.

33:14.665 --> 33:17.333
- Billy.
- We... we had a bit of a fight.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.939
- Did Evie do that to your face?
- Yeah. But...

33:20.404 --> 33:22.371
I deserved it. I was being kind of a dick.

33:22.406 --> 33:25.541
- Is she okay?
- No, no, I'm the only one with bruises.

33:25.576 --> 33:27.465
This happen yesterday, right?

33:28.312 --> 33:29.678
That was the text.

33:29.962 --> 33:31.709
Where the hell were you?

33:32.182 --> 33:35.961
Don't blame me if you're feeling guilty
because you're not around for your daughter.

33:40.205 --> 33:43.726
I'm sorry, I just wanted to
come over to apologize to Evie.

33:44.229 --> 33:45.955
Could you pass on the message?

33:45.958 --> 33:49.112
You wanna tell me what happened?

33:51.142 --> 33:52.594
I fucked up.

33:52.946 --> 33:56.239
I've been fucking up everything lately.

33:57.876 --> 33:59.375
I just really miss him.

33:59.706 --> 34:02.400
Come here.

34:10.853 --> 34:13.755
I miss your dad too. God.

34:15.273 --> 34:17.260
He was such a good man.

34:19.096 --> 34:22.873
- And he loved you so much, Billy.
- Why did you make him work for you?

34:26.167 --> 34:27.717
I...

34:28.078 --> 34:30.007
No, you used him.

34:30.697 --> 34:32.898
You used him because you knew you could.

34:33.833 --> 34:36.034
- That he liked you.
- No.

34:36.556 --> 34:38.781
It wasn't like that.

34:39.917 --> 34:42.257
He'd still be alive if it wasn't for you.

34:49.525 --> 34:51.364
He was the only one who believed me.

34:51.603 --> 34:53.286
And I was right.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.465
And by the end, he wanted to
find out what happened to Sam.

34:56.500 --> 34:59.302
I don't care about Sam, all
right? I just want my dad back.

35:00.091 --> 35:01.737
I know.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.298
I want him back too.

35:04.499 --> 35:05.972
I do.

35:09.338 --> 35:12.181
I'm tired of feeling like this.

35:13.107 --> 35:15.472
I feel bad all the time.

35:20.824 --> 35:22.992
Come here.

35:25.546 --> 35:29.644
You're gonna be okay. I promise you.

35:31.702 --> 35:33.887
I promise you. You're going to be okay.

35:34.317 --> 35:36.305
You're going to be okay.

35:36.340 --> 35:38.040
You're going to be okay.

35:40.033 --> 35:41.944
What are you doing?

35:42.924 --> 35:46.098
- I'm sorry. I...
- No, you can't do that.

35:46.116 --> 35:48.951
- I'm sorry. I promise you...
- It's all right.

35:48.986 --> 35:50.353
But go.

35:51.467 --> 35:53.241
- Now.
- Okay.

36:10.386 --> 36:12.902
And he's over-tired. It's
been a big day for him.

36:13.022 --> 36:14.465
I'm gonna put him to bed.

36:14.811 --> 36:17.063
- Good night.
- Night-night.

36:22.552 --> 36:24.153
- Night, Daddy.
- Night, buddy.

36:27.572 --> 36:30.393
All right, Kyle. Get some rest, little man.

36:34.552 --> 36:36.065
Give me a sec, will you?

36:37.275 --> 36:38.615
- I'm off.
- All right, honey.

36:38.649 --> 36:40.436
- Okay, girls, come on.
- Hey!

36:40.808 --> 36:42.471
Night, girls.

36:42.873 --> 36:44.407
They're so cute.

36:48.390 --> 36:49.757
- Hey.
- It's me.

36:50.801 --> 36:53.091
Where have you been? I've been
trying to get a hold of you.

36:53.366 --> 36:55.643
Oh, family shit.

36:57.619 --> 37:00.889
- Yeah, well there's a lot of that going around.
- So, what's going on?

37:01.195 --> 37:02.564
Are we safe?

37:03.070 --> 37:05.127
- Yeah. For now.
- What happened?

37:06.400 --> 37:09.811
It's complicated, but it's being resolved.

37:10.133 --> 37:13.702
- Uh, what do you mean?
- It means you don't need to worry about it.

37:15.336 --> 37:19.378
Is that because you paid back the
money or because I'm gonna get killed?

37:20.512 --> 37:22.698
I bet you wish you
didn't steal that car now.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.545
That's because you didn't drive it.

37:28.313 --> 37:30.686
What are these, Cuban?

37:31.222 --> 37:33.589
I don't know, how do you
tell the difference? I can't.

37:36.737 --> 37:38.164
You know what, man?

37:38.284 --> 37:40.341
- You know what's weird?
- What?

37:41.787 --> 37:43.378
I'm kind of excited,

37:43.498 --> 37:44.878
you know what I mean?

37:45.102 --> 37:46.735
Just going somewhere new.

37:47.411 --> 37:49.939
- Starting over.
- Sure.

37:52.039 --> 37:55.079
Where do you want to go, man?
Somewhere out east, maybe DC?

37:55.178 --> 37:57.015
DC's where the action is, man.

37:57.047 --> 38:00.445
- Yeah.
- San Francisco's small potatoes.

38:02.585 --> 38:04.620
Hey, you know, Cheat...

38:05.732 --> 38:08.119
Cheat would have loved Washington.

38:08.239 --> 38:09.857
Know what I mean?

38:10.972 --> 38:13.414
Know what I mean? All those hookers.

38:14.009 --> 38:15.998
Right?

38:17.072 --> 38:20.546
Oh... God, I miss the man every day.

38:24.105 --> 38:27.709
You know, I still can't get over
my kids' pictures on that wall.

38:28.979 --> 38:30.613
Yeah, man. Me too.

38:41.474 --> 38:43.377
You know, if nothing else, Nina,

38:43.422 --> 38:45.178
you certainly aren't boring.

38:46.697 --> 38:48.334
Is that why you like me?

38:48.782 --> 38:50.365
Who said I liked you?

38:50.886 --> 38:52.535
What's there not to like?

38:53.737 --> 38:55.797
I think you're a little
too dangerous for me.

38:55.807 --> 38:58.349
Come on, you can live a little.

38:59.072 --> 39:00.764
So when am I going to see you again?

39:01.120 --> 39:02.309
Soon.

39:02.803 --> 39:04.813
Yeah, I think I'd like that.

39:05.749 --> 39:07.338
Hey, Nina?

39:08.118 --> 39:09.741
What?

39:13.039 --> 39:14.657
Aah, nothing.

39:15.445 --> 39:16.964
I'll call you.

39:33.243 --> 39:35.110
Hey. Have you seen Spud?

39:35.412 --> 39:37.846
No, he hasn't come up yet.

39:49.125 --> 39:53.098
I'm just gonna be glad when all
this stuff is behind us, man.

39:57.619 --> 39:59.368
You know?

40:06.336 --> 40:09.396
You wanna go back to the house,
get out of this fucking rain?

40:18.309 --> 40:21.876
_

40:23.159 --> 40:24.727
Where'd you get that?

40:25.425 --> 40:27.630
They were all over the neighborhood.

40:29.879 --> 40:32.200
Fuck.

40:35.486 --> 40:37.946
The lengths that these
people are gonna go through

40:38.115 --> 40:40.350
to cover their tracks, man, look at that.

40:40.710 --> 40:42.474
If I didn't know the truth, I would

40:42.594 --> 40:44.794
think that that was an ordinary guy.

40:44.914 --> 40:47.359
You said he arrived in the
country two weeks ago, right?

40:52.864 --> 40:55.291
Yeah, I must have gotten the dates wrong.

40:57.145 --> 40:59.461
Fuck. I can't believe that.

40:59.889 --> 41:01.908
I met his mother.

41:08.231 --> 41:09.938
You met his mother?

41:10.238 --> 41:14.313
He was a Jewish art student, Spud.

41:16.146 --> 41:18.714
That's a pretty good cover, right?

41:19.929 --> 41:21.810
I mean, I wouldn't have ever known.

41:22.133 --> 41:23.715
Why?

41:26.923 --> 41:27.817
Why?

41:29.292 --> 41:31.226
Cheat... Cheat.

41:32.747 --> 41:34.878
He was out of control.

41:35.966 --> 41:37.978
He was gonna get us caught.

41:38.583 --> 41:41.578
That's the fucking chair,
man. That's the fucking chair.

41:44.341 --> 41:46.308
So you killed him?

41:47.254 --> 41:49.077
You killed Cheat?

41:49.622 --> 41:51.146
Ray.

41:54.729 --> 41:56.664
Ray, we're fucking dads.

41:57.988 --> 41:59.909
We have fucking families.

42:01.336 --> 42:03.492
Cheat never understood that.

42:06.348 --> 42:08.264
I didn't want to do it.

42:12.535 --> 42:14.169
I didn't want to do it, but I...

42:14.517 --> 42:17.239
I can't let Kyle grow
up without a father, man.

42:17.273 --> 42:21.310
You can't let April and Alice grow up
without a father. What choice did I have?

42:21.413 --> 42:24.113
- You could've talked to him.
- No, man, we tried.

42:24.147 --> 42:27.264
- It's not gonna make a fucking difference.
- You could've talked to us.

42:27.318 --> 42:30.119
I know what you guys think
of me. I'm the joke, right?

42:30.153 --> 42:31.920
- I'm the runt, I'm the joke.
- Spud!

42:31.955 --> 42:35.057
No, man, I know. Why couldn't
I just take care of business?

42:35.617 --> 42:37.092
For once?

42:38.136 --> 42:41.204
I did it for you, man. I did
it for Ethan, I did it for us.

42:41.231 --> 42:44.109
We're family, man. I did it for us.

42:44.229 --> 42:47.679
You did this for his fucking
money, and you fucking know it.

42:47.710 --> 42:51.268
No, man, I didn't... That's not
true. I didn't take the money.

42:51.278 --> 42:54.047
- I didn't care about the money. I did it for us.
- And Kendra?

42:54.793 --> 42:56.402
That fucking guy that was with her?

42:56.464 --> 42:58.747
That poor fucking kid we
put in a fucking grave?

42:58.782 --> 43:00.399
You did all that for us too, huh?

43:00.485 --> 43:03.094
I didn't want to do any of
that. It just got too fucked up.

43:03.219 --> 43:06.555
It just got so fucked up. I don't
know how it got so fucked up.

43:07.531 --> 43:10.351
You have to fucking believe
me, man, you have to believe me.

43:10.393 --> 43:12.891
- Fuck you.
- I didn't have a fucking choice, man.

43:12.929 --> 43:14.296
- I didn't.
- Fuck you.

43:14.330 --> 43:16.615
- I didn't have a choice!
- Fuck you.

43:17.355 --> 43:18.863
Hey, Spud!

43:19.340 --> 43:20.483
Ray?

43:25.613 --> 43:28.043
Ray, don't fucking do this, man.

43:28.511 --> 43:30.312
Ray, don't fucking do this, please.

43:31.314 --> 43:33.282
Listen to me. I'm so sorry.

43:34.417 --> 43:35.918
I'm so sorry, okay?

43:36.252 --> 43:39.982
I'm sorry, I don't know what
the fuck I did. I'm so sorry.

43:41.524 --> 43:42.824
It's going to be okay.

43:43.059 --> 43:44.784
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

43:47.748 --> 43:49.531
Spud?

43:53.536 --> 43:54.836
Ray?

43:55.238 --> 43:56.538
It's okay, buddy.

43:57.461 --> 43:59.556
What are we gonna tell Ethan?

44:01.211 --> 44:03.553
I can't... You gotta help me.

44:06.349 --> 44:08.037
It's gonna be okay.

44:08.184 --> 44:09.484
I can't...

44:14.245 --> 44:15.724
I'm so sorry.

44:19.629 --> 44:21.230
What are you doing?

44:22.098 --> 44:23.398
I...

44:23.821 --> 44:25.500
Ray. Ray.

44:26.857 --> 44:29.144
Ray. Ray.

44:38.092 --> 44:39.714
Spud?
