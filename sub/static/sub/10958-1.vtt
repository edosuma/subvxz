04:21.200 --> 04:23.919
<i>Michelle,
please don't hang up.</i>

04:24.680 --> 04:28.673
<i>Just talk to me, okay?
I can't believe you just left.</i>

04:29.840 --> 04:31.068
<i>Michelle.</i>

04:31.920 --> 04:33.273
<i>Come back.</i>

04:35.200 --> 04:36.872
<i>Please say something.</i>

04:38.360 --> 04:40.555
<i>Michelle, talk to me.</i>

04:41.800 --> 04:43.950
<i>Look, we had an argument.
Couples fight.</i>

04:44.040 --> 04:46.713
<i>That is no reason
to just leave everything behind.</i>

04:49.040 --> 04:51.349
<i>Running away isn't gonna help it any.
Michelle, please...</i>

04:59.200 --> 05:00.394
More details on that.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.675
<i>Elsewhere today,
power has still not been restored</i>

05:02.760 --> 05:04.637
<i>to many cities on the southern seaboard</i>

05:04.720 --> 05:07.280
<i>in the wake of
this afternoon's widespread blackout.</i>

05:07.360 --> 05:09.715
<i>While there had been
some inclement weather in the region,</i>

05:09.800 --> 05:11.472
<i>the problem seems linked to
what authorities are calling</i>

05:11.560 --> 05:14.552
<i>a catastrophic power surge
that has crippled traffic in the area.</i>

07:54.400 --> 07:55.469
No.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.079
No!

08:49.040 --> 08:50.189
Damn.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.551
Okay. Okay, please.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.314
Please.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.112
Please don't hurt me.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.354
Please.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.870
Just let me go, okay?
I won't tell anybody.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.357
I promise, okay?
Please just let me go. Please.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.910
You need fluids.
You were in shock.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.630
What are you going to do to me?

10:46.880 --> 10:49.030
I'm going to keep you alive.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.030
Work on getting handy with these.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.755
My boyfriend was expecting me.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.551
He'll send the cops looking.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.959
I'm sorry.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.150
But no one is looking for you.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.836
You've got some fight in you.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.759
I can respect that.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.392
But don't even think
about trying that again.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.229
You're lucky to be here at all.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.995
And my generosity only extends so far.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.148
Eggs.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.598
Toradol to help with your pain.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.239
Please.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.990
Please, just let me go. Please.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.196
There is nowhere to go, Michelle.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.553
I looked through your wallet.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.996
Given as how I saved your life,
I think that's acceptable.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.036
You're lucky to be here at all.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.439
What do you mean?

15:46.520 --> 15:50.354
I found you, and I saved your life
by bringing you here.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.711
I don't understand. I...

16:05.880 --> 16:07.791
There's been an attack.

16:10.680 --> 16:11.680
What?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.470
An attack. A big one.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.952
I'm not sure yet
if it's chemical or nuclear,

16:18.680 --> 16:20.159
but down here, we're safe.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.550
- And where are we exactly?
- Underneath my farmhouse.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.913
Forty miles outside of Lake Charles.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.708
I was driving north of here.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.791
You were in an accident.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.955
You were turned over
on the side of the road.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.873
I was driving by and I saw...

16:43.240 --> 16:45.037
I saved your life, Michelle.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.755
I couldn't just leave you there.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.429
Okay.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.434
Well,

16:54.920 --> 16:57.593
thank you so much

16:57.680 --> 16:59.830
for saving my life.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.149
I guess I should go to a hospital now.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.953
You can't leave.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.114
An attack means fallout.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.349
Which contaminates
the air above ground.

17:16.440 --> 17:17.953
That's how it works.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.031
How long do we have to wait
until it's safe?

17:20.119 --> 17:22.236
Depends on the proximity
of the closest blast.

17:22.319 --> 17:23.435
One year, maybe two.

17:26.319 --> 17:29.949
And that's if we're talking
about weapons that we know of.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.996
Russians are developing
some nasty stuff.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.470
And if the Martians
finally figured out a way to get here,

17:35.560 --> 17:39.997
their weapons will make
the Russkies' look like sticks and stones.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.479
Luckily,

17:45.480 --> 17:47.436
I've prepared for this.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.635
Right.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.755
Well, I'll need to use your phone then

17:59.840 --> 18:02.832
to call my family
and tell them that I'm safe here

18:02.920 --> 18:05.195
and make sure they're okay.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.350
Michelle, they're not okay.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.593
How do you know that?

18:14.720 --> 18:17.109
Everyone outside of here is dead.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.673
But what about you?
Don't you have a family?

18:32.040 --> 18:33.268
Who's that?

18:34.640 --> 18:35.640
Excuse me.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.032
What did you do?

18:58.600 --> 19:01.319
You know what, Michelle?
I'm gonna tell you what I told him.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.071
You need to eat, you need to sleep,

19:04.160 --> 19:07.675
and you need to start
showing me a little bit of appreciation.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.399
My name is Howard, by the way.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.231
Oh, God! Oh, shit.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.513
I'm sorry.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.673
I'm sorry about that.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.955
Uh, I didn't mean to scare you.

20:12.640 --> 20:13.959
Are you, um...

20:14.440 --> 20:15.634
Here. You hungry?

20:21.360 --> 20:23.749
So, how are you doing? You okay?

20:25.400 --> 20:27.789
- What is this?
- It's a bunker.

20:28.720 --> 20:33.157
Your room's a little bit of a fixer-upper,
but at least you got a door.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.035
A scary door, but you still got a door.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.436
How long have you been down here?

20:39.520 --> 20:41.078
Couple of days, I think.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.953
You know,
it's actually kind of hard to tell

20:43.040 --> 20:46.157
with no windows or sunlight
or anything.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.037
I mean,
how do we get out of here?

20:50.480 --> 20:52.072
Oh, he didn't tell you?

20:53.040 --> 20:54.189
About...

20:57.760 --> 21:00.433
Getting out of here
is the last thing you want to do.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.911
Because the air up there,

21:03.360 --> 21:04.554
it's contaminated.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.038
I see you've met Emmett.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.028
What happened to him?

21:13.120 --> 21:14.997
He did that to himself.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.960
And his stumbling around
isn't helping anything.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.152
What you heard earlier,

21:19.240 --> 21:23.199
was him knocking over a shelf
with a whole week's worth of food,

21:23.280 --> 21:25.236
which he's sorry for, correct?

21:27.880 --> 21:29.029
Totally.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.830
Let's go. Bathroom time.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.912
This is the common area.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.798
Good for R & R.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.553
As you can see,
I've planned for a long stay.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.470
The aquaponics system
cleans the air and keeps it fresh.

21:59.200 --> 22:02.909
This is the living room.
Help yourself to any reading.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.790
If you like to watch films,
I have some on DVD and VHS cassette.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.676
Just make sure you put them back
in their sleeve when they're done.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.635
The kitchen's fully functional.

22:14.720 --> 22:19.077
Has an electric stove,
refrigerator, freezer, silverware.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.158
And that table's a family heirloom,

22:21.240 --> 22:22.832
which means watch your glasses.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.071
Always use coasters and placemats.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.271
Keep your hands to yourself!

22:31.600 --> 22:32.919
Understand?

22:33.760 --> 22:35.193
No touching.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.200
Take a seat.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.269
This way.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.395
This is my private space.

23:09.880 --> 23:13.156
Off-limits, unless
I give express permission.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.188
Go ahead.

23:17.640 --> 23:20.359
- I don't need to.
- You will, though.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.113
And I've got to pace
these things out, so please.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.159
I need privacy.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.231
You're welcome to close the curtain.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.230
I can't with you standing there.

23:35.760 --> 23:38.433
And I can't trust you
not to burn this place down.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.516
This is for my own safety.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.513
I'm not some pervert! Just go.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.110
Don't flush
unless you've gone!

24:02.040 --> 24:03.678
We can't afford wasted flushes.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.954
Take a seat. Are you hungry?

24:21.040 --> 24:23.031
Those are Megan's.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.797
She never went anywhere
without two or three of those things.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.199
Who's Megan?

24:28.720 --> 24:30.870
Megan's not with us anymore.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.349
Don't worry. Just the generator.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.718
Maybe it's a car outside.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.712
That's not possible.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.400
I heard one earlier. Above my room.

24:51.480 --> 24:54.677
If you had heard a car,
the driver would be long dead by now.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.955
Well, shouldn't we at least try

24:57.040 --> 25:01.079
to call the police or someone
to find out what actually happened?

25:01.160 --> 25:02.991
There's no one left to call.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.230
See that? Nothing's coming through.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.113
You think I sound crazy.

25:17.760 --> 25:20.433
I mean, it's amazing. You people...

25:21.160 --> 25:23.390
You wear helmets
when you ride your bikes.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.675
You have seat belts in your cars.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.955
You have alarm systems
to protect your homes.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.190
But what do you do
when those alarms go off?

25:31.720 --> 25:36.032
"Crazy" is building your ark
after the flood has already come!

25:43.640 --> 25:46.677
I think maybe it's time
you met Frank and Mildred.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.553
Closest I could get to an airlock.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.996
See?

27:09.360 --> 27:11.078
What happened to them?

27:11.160 --> 27:13.071
They weren't as lucky as you.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.039
It's the air, Michelle.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.395
That's what happens
when you get exposed.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.834
I keep this door sealed at all times.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.672
No one comes in or out.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.478
Met Frank and Mildred, huh?

28:00.840 --> 28:02.353
It's funny, right?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.194
The whole world ends

28:04.280 --> 28:07.158
and the thing he's most upset about
is a pair of dead pigs?

28:09.040 --> 28:11.156
You in need of some reading material?

28:12.200 --> 28:13.758
I took all the quizzes. Sorry.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.554
But I did learn
how to do a French braid, so,

28:25.680 --> 28:28.956
you know, if you want me
to do that for you, just let me know.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.792
What do you know about him?

28:39.440 --> 28:41.749
He was in the Navy, I know that.

28:42.720 --> 28:46.190
I guess he did, uh,
some stuff with satellites.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.998
What kind of stuff?

28:49.720 --> 28:51.472
Satellite stuff.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.998
Well, what brought him out here?

28:55.680 --> 28:57.113
I'm not sure.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.829
He bought this property a while back.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.038
But I never paid much attention

29:03.120 --> 29:05.998
till he hired me to help him
get this place set up.

29:07.200 --> 29:11.159
The work was entertaining, though,
that's for sure.

29:12.520 --> 29:15.830
You know, Howard's like a black belt
in conspiracy theory.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.556
Plus, you know, how often
do you get hired to help build

29:19.640 --> 29:21.358
a doomsday bunker?

29:22.160 --> 29:23.388
So, he didn't

29:24.920 --> 29:26.273
kidnap you?

29:27.360 --> 29:28.998
No!

29:30.440 --> 29:32.874
What about your arm?
Weren't you trying to escape?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.479
I was trying to get in.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.035
I watched Howard build this place,
piece by piece, for years.

29:40.120 --> 29:42.156
He was always talking about,

29:42.240 --> 29:43.958
you know, possible attacks from

29:44.960 --> 29:47.599
Al Qaeda, Russia, South Korea.

29:47.720 --> 29:48.948
You mean North Korea.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.712
Is that the crazy one?

29:52.040 --> 29:53.758
So, yeah, that one.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.554
And, uh, you know,
poured all his money into this place.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.790
Took to it like his life depended on it.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.030
Which, you know,

30:03.720 --> 30:05.358
that stays with you.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.554
So...

30:12.760 --> 30:14.273
He told you all this

30:16.240 --> 30:18.276
while you're building his bomb shelter.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.237
And now he says that

30:20.320 --> 30:23.153
the air is contaminated
and everybody's dead.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.876
Yeah, I know what you're getting at,
but there's more to it.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.313
Howard abducted me.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.150
He drove me off the road
and he dragged me here.

30:35.520 --> 30:39.638
So, whatever he's telling you
about the air, some big attack,

30:39.720 --> 30:42.359
the purpose of this shelter, is a lie.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.839
No. No way.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.277
The attack, I saw it myself.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.793
What do you mean?

30:49.920 --> 30:51.990
I was on my way home from work.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.676
And it looked like a flash.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.873
Bright red.

30:58.760 --> 31:01.194
Like an explosion, from way far off.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.678
It wasn't like fireworks.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.591
Naw, this was more like
something you'd read about in the Bible.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.990
So, what, you saw, what,
a flash of light? Lightning?

31:17.840 --> 31:19.353
A fire that flared up?

31:19.480 --> 31:20.629
I'm not explaining it right.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.950
This wasn't like anything I'd ever seen.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.109
And so, my first thought
was to come here.

31:26.200 --> 31:29.431
And when I got here,
Howard was closing the door.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.795
And I could see it,
right there on his face,

31:31.880 --> 31:33.472
he knew something was happening.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.753
Something bad.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.151
And so, I fought my way in.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.114
I heard a car.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.391
Right here. Above us.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.673
You heard someone?

31:57.760 --> 31:59.239
Right above us.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.393
That isn't possible.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.117
- The air is...
- What, contaminated?

32:10.040 --> 32:12.952
- How do you know that?
- Because I told him.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.759
Dinner's ready.

32:31.640 --> 32:34.234
I see you two are getting along.

32:55.560 --> 32:56.560
Hmm.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.913
How's that sauce?

33:09.880 --> 33:10.880
It's fine.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.190
As cooks go, I'm okay.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.151
Not great, but okay.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.791
Megan was a good cook.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.231
You'll learn to love cooking.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.154
Mmm...

33:30.880 --> 33:32.154
Mmm.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.593
It's delicious.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.591
That's the best sauce I've ever tasted.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.673
Are you being funny?

33:39.760 --> 33:41.159
No, I mean,

33:41.920 --> 33:44.593
considering the alternative,
which is, you know,

33:44.680 --> 33:48.434
getting burnt up in a chemical attack,
or nuclear,

33:48.920 --> 33:51.878
I'd say being alive and down here would

33:51.960 --> 33:54.269
make a fried turd taste pretty good, so...

33:56.000 --> 33:57.752
Best damn sauce I ever had.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.596
That's not a bad point.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.671
And, please,
watch your language at table.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.074
Right?

34:11.880 --> 34:14.553
You know what I haven't been able to
get out of my head, for some reason?

34:14.639 --> 34:16.471
Ever since I got down here.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.473
Tattoos.

34:20.239 --> 34:21.878
Always wanted one.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.639
But I never got any.
'Cause everybody always said,

34:24.719 --> 34:27.199
"No, no, Emmett, you'll never get
a decent job if you do that."

34:27.560 --> 34:28.675
Whatever.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.431
Like that matters now, right?

34:31.679 --> 34:33.636
T ell you what,
if I had known this was coming,

34:33.719 --> 34:37.156
I would've gotten, like,
50 of them. I swear, man.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.675
I would look like a circus freak,
or something.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.239
I'd just be covered head to toe.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.594
Tattoos all over my...
You know, everywhere. Face?

34:43.679 --> 34:46.592
Sure. Right there. Across my forehead.

34:47.159 --> 34:49.674
Just my name. "Emmett."

34:50.600 --> 34:51.918
Or, you know,

34:52.760 --> 34:54.478
"Thug Life."

34:54.800 --> 34:55.835
"YOLO."

34:55.920 --> 34:57.069
I don't even know what that means,

34:57.160 --> 34:58.673
but, you know,
I hear people saying it all the time,

34:58.760 --> 35:00.000
so, it must be cool.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.834
Hey, what about you, Howard?

35:09.520 --> 35:11.351
Anything you wish you'd done?

35:15.160 --> 35:16.912
In all honesty, no.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.275
No?

35:20.760 --> 35:22.990
No crazy nights in Vegas?

35:24.960 --> 35:27.428
Maybe, uh, take a pilgrimage to Waco?

35:29.880 --> 35:32.075
Everything I wanted to do, I did.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.757
I focused on being prepared.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.439
And I was.

35:38.040 --> 35:39.519
And here we are.

35:51.320 --> 35:52.958
Oh, my goodness.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.473
Is that Monopoly?

35:56.080 --> 35:57.559
There we go!

35:57.640 --> 35:59.517
Yeah, that's how we kill the time.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.477
What would you say, Howard,
we're gonna be down here,

36:01.560 --> 36:03.915
what, like, a year? Two? Maybe?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.672
I bet you if we started a game right now,

36:06.760 --> 36:08.432
we might even
get halfway finished by the time...

36:08.560 --> 36:09.754
Stop talking!

36:18.080 --> 36:21.390
You don't need to make jokes about
how long we're going to be down here

36:21.480 --> 36:23.948
when nobody knows
how long that's going to be.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.670
Your humor is not funny.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.671
I don't appreciate it
while I'm trying to eat,

36:28.760 --> 36:29.800
and neither does Michelle.

36:30.120 --> 36:33.271
Now, please shut up
and let us eat in peace.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.149
Hmm.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.640
Emmett?

37:04.480 --> 37:06.152
Would you pass me a napkin?

37:14.200 --> 37:15.474
Thank you.

37:15.560 --> 37:19.075
I know what you're saying.
I never could finish <i>Monopoly.</i>

37:19.840 --> 37:22.274
That game really
does take forever, right?

37:23.440 --> 37:25.158
For me, though, it was, um...

37:25.840 --> 37:27.353
<i>Chutes and Ladders,</i>

37:27.880 --> 37:29.029
uh...

37:29.720 --> 37:31.233
<i>Sorry!,</i>

37:31.320 --> 37:33.072
and <i>Trouble.</i>

37:33.160 --> 37:35.754
You know, the thing with the dice
and the thing that you pressed,

37:35.840 --> 37:37.558
- what was that called?
- The...

37:37.640 --> 37:40.234
Pop-O-Matic bubble! Yeah.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.920
Did you ever play that, um...
What was that, <i>Operation?</i>

37:43.000 --> 37:44.274
- Loved <i>Operation!</i>
- I'm telling you, man,

37:44.360 --> 37:45.429
I couldn't play that game.

37:45.520 --> 37:46.669
- It terrified me.
- Why...

37:46.760 --> 37:50.275
That noise that thing would make
when you hit that edge. I mean...

37:50.360 --> 37:52.590
- Good Lord!
- It was pretty scary.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.680
Could you hand me the salt?

37:58.520 --> 37:59.589
Please?

38:04.880 --> 38:06.074
Ah, shoot! I'm sorry.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.198
I'm gonna need the pepper also.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.632
What exactly do you think you're doing?

38:18.720 --> 38:19.755
I'm asking for pepper.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.239
Like hell you were! What was that?

38:21.360 --> 38:22.713
I don't know what you're
talking about, Howard.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.109
Are you trying to insult me?

38:25.240 --> 38:29.153
Here, in the shelter that I built
that's keeping you alive?

38:29.240 --> 38:32.073
You don't think I see what you just did?

38:32.680 --> 38:35.478
Is that how you thank me
for saving your life?

38:35.560 --> 38:36.760
- Howard, calm down.
- Shut up!

38:37.080 --> 38:39.355
Shut up and stay in your seat!

38:46.080 --> 38:47.195
Is it?

38:47.560 --> 38:49.391
Now, let me tell you,

38:50.040 --> 38:52.349
I know what a traitor looks like.

38:52.440 --> 38:53.793
Understand?

38:55.760 --> 39:00.231
I have shown you nothing,
but generosity and hospitality.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.751
I want you to apologize.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.955
To tell me you're going to behave.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.268
I will.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.273
You will what?

39:21.960 --> 39:23.473
I'll behave.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.797
And I'm so sorry.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.640
Sit.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.279
Ah...

39:56.480 --> 39:58.277
Have to stay hydrated.

39:59.640 --> 40:00.709
Hmm.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.710
That's easy to forget down here.

40:15.360 --> 40:16.588
What's wrong?

40:18.120 --> 40:19.314
Nothing.

40:30.680 --> 40:31.715
Where are my keys?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.317
Michelle!

40:51.040 --> 40:53.156
Michelle! Stop!

41:05.720 --> 41:07.392
Give me those keys!

41:08.880 --> 41:10.871
- Come on.
- No! Don't!

41:21.360 --> 41:22.679
Stop!

41:25.600 --> 41:28.319
No! No, don't! Don't!

41:28.400 --> 41:29.400
Don't open that door!

41:33.920 --> 41:35.319
There's a car!

41:35.400 --> 41:37.834
- There's a car! I see a car!
- No!

41:38.400 --> 41:40.994
Here! Here! Here!

41:41.080 --> 41:43.594
Michelle,
listen to me, don't do this!

41:46.760 --> 41:48.796
Oh, God! Thank God!

41:50.360 --> 41:52.510
- There's a woman.
- Open the door!

41:52.920 --> 41:55.832
It's okay.
I just want to come inside.

41:55.920 --> 41:57.990
She looks hurt.
She wants me to let her in.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.548
Do not let her in!

42:00.640 --> 42:03.393
- Look at her face, Michelle!
- No!

42:03.480 --> 42:06.790
No, no, no!

42:07.280 --> 42:08.554
No!

42:08.640 --> 42:11.438
Oh, my God, I'm fine. I really am fine.

42:11.520 --> 42:14.034
- No, please, I'm okay.
- There's...

42:14.120 --> 42:17.237
It really only...
It only touched me a little. A little!

42:17.320 --> 42:20.392
So, could you open the door? Open it!

42:20.800 --> 42:23.314
- She's begging me.
- You can't help her!

42:23.400 --> 42:24.515
No one can!

42:24.600 --> 42:26.636
Let me in. I'll be okay.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.837
I'll be okay.
It really hardly touched me at all.

42:31.160 --> 42:33.754
- Open the door!
- Don't listen to her!

42:33.840 --> 42:36.912
God! Open the door, you bitch!

42:37.000 --> 42:38.479
Let me in!

42:39.640 --> 42:41.949
Let me in! Let me in!

42:42.320 --> 42:44.197
Let me in! Let me in!

42:46.320 --> 42:47.639
You!

42:48.120 --> 42:51.271
You! You! You!

42:52.480 --> 42:53.629
You!

43:22.320 --> 43:23.435
I know it's hard,

43:25.360 --> 43:27.476
realizing they're all gone.

43:29.960 --> 43:31.598
The ones you love.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.429
I have something to confess to you.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.556
I crashed into your car.

43:48.360 --> 43:49.475
Your accident

43:51.040 --> 43:52.758
was my fault.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.151
When I found out about
the incoming attack,

43:58.280 --> 43:59.952
I got frantic.

44:00.040 --> 44:02.759
I knew I needed to get back here
as soon as possible,

44:02.840 --> 44:05.115
so I was driving like a maniac.

44:08.720 --> 44:10.711
I tried to pass you,

44:11.280 --> 44:12.429
and

44:14.920 --> 44:17.229
I'm the reason you went off the road.

44:19.240 --> 44:22.073
I mean, I know I seem
like a sensible guy,

44:22.600 --> 44:25.353
but at the time, I wasn't myself.

44:27.400 --> 44:30.551
It was an accident, but it was my fault.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.672
I was afraid to tell you,

44:35.760 --> 44:36.909
and,

44:39.080 --> 44:40.433
I'm sorry.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.668
Um...

44:50.760 --> 44:52.352
You should shower.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.078
Even the smallest amount of air

44:54.160 --> 44:56.993
that came through the hinges
could be toxic.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.273
These were Megan's.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.028
If you want.

45:07.800 --> 45:10.394
I recognized that woman's car.

45:10.520 --> 45:12.556
Her name was Leslie, I think.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.279
You knew her?

45:16.720 --> 45:18.278
She was a neighbor.

45:19.320 --> 45:22.232
Emmett wasn't the only one
who knew about this place.

45:23.240 --> 45:26.789
If any others somehow survived,
they could be coming here, too.

45:29.800 --> 45:33.509
As of Friday, kindness and generosity
are antiquated customs.

45:41.160 --> 45:43.151
I'm going to need some stitches.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.958
What? You want me to...

45:55.040 --> 45:56.678
This is your doing, isn't it?

45:57.680 --> 45:59.477
I mean, I don't think I'm really qualified.

45:59.560 --> 46:01.357
I'll walk you through it.

46:05.520 --> 46:06.520
Here.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.233
Have a drink.

46:14.360 --> 46:15.509
What is it?

46:16.400 --> 46:19.198
Technically, it's vodka.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.639
Ah! It's safe. I distilled it myself.

46:35.760 --> 46:36.840
I just said I distilled it,

46:36.880 --> 46:38.996
I didn't say anything about it
actually tasting good.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.196
- Yeah, that's awful.
- You want it on the rocks?

46:45.920 --> 46:47.600
Little trick I taught myself
as a young man

46:47.680 --> 46:50.069
stationed on a ship
with way too much free time.

46:50.720 --> 46:53.757
Every now and again,
if the C.O. was working us too hard,

46:53.840 --> 46:55.512
we'd freeze and snap the knob off

46:55.600 --> 46:57.750
the bathroom door
while he was still inside.

46:58.840 --> 47:01.354
It usually took him an hour or two
to get out.

47:04.920 --> 47:07.309
- I'm good.
- Suit yourself. Cheers.

47:10.120 --> 47:11.439
Ah...

47:16.800 --> 47:18.279
This is clean.

47:18.640 --> 47:20.835
All you need to do is stitch.

47:43.720 --> 47:45.073
You're doing fine.

47:48.960 --> 47:51.190
Some stuff
I grabbed from your car.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.272
I didn't have time
to bring in the booze. Sadly.

47:58.280 --> 47:59.793
What is all that?

48:03.640 --> 48:05.551
I wanted to design clothes.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.915
No wonder you were so good
with the stitches.

48:10.480 --> 48:12.357
Megan wanted to be an artist.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.673
She was your daughter?

48:17.200 --> 48:18.349
Yes.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.991
She was smart.

48:25.760 --> 48:28.957
Loved to read.
The magazines were just for fun.

48:29.280 --> 48:32.272
She inhaled books. Anything with Paris.

48:32.600 --> 48:35.478
She liked their movies,
their culture, you know.

48:36.120 --> 48:37.155
We used to have this little joke.

48:37.240 --> 48:39.515
Every once in a while I'd ask her,

48:39.600 --> 48:41.716
"What do you want to be
when you grow up?"

48:43.040 --> 48:44.268
You know what she'd say?

48:46.360 --> 48:47.679
"French."

48:49.680 --> 48:53.468
Anyway, her mother
turned her against me.

48:53.560 --> 48:55.471
Took her off to Chicago.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.191
People are strange creatures.

49:00.040 --> 49:03.316
You can't always convince them
that safety is in their own best interest.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.591
You don't know they're gone.

49:10.200 --> 49:13.510
Anyway, at least I tried to help them.

49:22.240 --> 49:24.196
Hey.

49:26.200 --> 49:29.397
There was nothing
you could've done for that woman.

49:30.080 --> 49:32.753
Even if you let her in,
she still would've died.

49:38.600 --> 49:42.388
You asked earlier about regrets?

49:44.680 --> 49:46.398
Yeah, I've got some of those.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.798
Welcome to the club.

49:59.280 --> 50:02.511
I mean,
I lived my life in a 40-mile radius.

50:03.960 --> 50:07.396
And that was by design.
I made sure that happened.

50:08.840 --> 50:10.671
I was so fast in high school,

50:10.760 --> 50:13.479
I even managed to outrun
my bad grades.

50:17.640 --> 50:21.633
I was All-State track three years in a row.

50:23.800 --> 50:27.110
Caught a full ride to Louisiana Tech,
up there in Ruston.

50:31.440 --> 50:34.637
I remember I spent
the last two weeks of that summer

50:35.280 --> 50:39.159
showing off the bus ticket they sent me
to anybody who'd take a look at it.

50:40.760 --> 50:43.877
And then came the night before
I was supposed to leave.

50:47.680 --> 50:49.511
And I just got so worried

50:52.800 --> 50:55.473
about how bad I was gonna do up there

50:55.800 --> 50:57.677
with all those smart kids.

51:01.520 --> 51:03.431
So, I went out of my way

51:04.480 --> 51:07.278
to get just piss-wasted so bad

51:07.360 --> 51:10.432
that I knew there was no chance
I was waking up in the morning.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.392
So, I missed the bus.

51:17.360 --> 51:19.920
And I didn't buy a ticket for the next one.

51:20.880 --> 51:22.393
Or the one after that.

51:25.880 --> 51:28.599
Well, if you'd gone,
you might be dead now.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.352
Yeah, lucky me, right?

51:33.120 --> 51:34.473
Lucky us.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.948
A few years ago,

51:43.560 --> 51:45.551
I was at a hardware store.

51:46.520 --> 51:49.796
And there was this little
girl with her dad.

51:51.280 --> 51:54.033
And he was in a hurry,
and she wasn't keeping up.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.319
So, he kept

51:57.440 --> 51:59.317
yanking on her arm.

52:00.520 --> 52:02.636
But really hard, you know?

52:03.960 --> 52:05.279
Too hard.

52:09.400 --> 52:11.072
I know that feeling.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.676
When my dad got that way,

52:17.640 --> 52:21.030
my brother Colin was always there
to take the worst of it

52:21.800 --> 52:23.153
for me.

52:25.640 --> 52:27.471
And I thought, seeing this little girl,

52:27.560 --> 52:31.075
I thought maybe I could do that

52:31.880 --> 52:33.233
for her.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.391
But I just kept watching.

52:41.760 --> 52:44.399
And they're about to leave,
and I've done nothing.

52:47.480 --> 52:50.119
And she slips.

52:51.800 --> 52:54.473
And it throws him off-balance,
and he hits her.

52:56.760 --> 52:59.638
And I wanted so badly to do something

52:59.720 --> 53:01.438
to help her, but...

53:01.880 --> 53:04.599
I did what I always do
when things get hard.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.474
I just panicked and ran.

53:14.760 --> 53:16.876
Look, we're here.

53:17.680 --> 53:19.193
We're alive.

53:20.400 --> 53:22.231
And that means something.

53:25.280 --> 53:26.713
It's gotta.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.359
- You've got to be kidding me.
- What?

55:02.800 --> 55:04.791
We're missing pieces here.

55:05.560 --> 55:09.235
Look at this poor cat.
He's been deformed. He's got one eye.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.870
He's about to go snorkeling
and everything, too.

55:15.400 --> 55:16.674
What are you doing?

55:21.080 --> 55:22.672
Ooh!

55:22.760 --> 55:25.320
Cornering the market on
post-apocalyptic fashion, huh?

55:25.400 --> 55:26.400
Mmm-hmm.

55:26.520 --> 55:28.795
You need more axes and chain saws.

55:28.880 --> 55:30.757
For what? She has a shotgun.

55:30.840 --> 55:32.910
Yeah. But what if up there it's like...

55:33.960 --> 55:35.837
What? Lumberjacks?

55:35.920 --> 55:36.955
Zombies.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.914
Though even Howard doesn't think
that one's plausible.

55:41.400 --> 55:44.551
But you should hear his theory
about mutant space worms.

55:49.840 --> 55:51.273
What is that? Howard!

55:51.360 --> 55:53.430
Stay calm. We're okay.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.749
- What was that?
- Quiet.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.591
That sounds like helicopters.

56:08.280 --> 56:09.554
Could be military.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.673
But not ours.

56:12.240 --> 56:15.038
- How can you tell?
- Fourteen years in the Navy.

56:15.120 --> 56:16.997
What's happening up there?

56:17.080 --> 56:18.274
My guess?

56:19.400 --> 56:22.437
Those flashes that kicked this all off?

56:22.800 --> 56:24.472
That was phase one.

56:25.120 --> 56:27.793
Take out your opponent's
population centers

56:27.880 --> 56:30.678
with big hits, all at once, fast.

56:31.480 --> 56:32.959
And then for round two,

56:33.480 --> 56:35.118
ground sweeps.

56:35.200 --> 56:38.829
A satellite log showed an increase
in coded traffic recently.

56:39.200 --> 56:41.395
Possibly extraterrestrial signals.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.231
I bet what we just heard
were airborne patrols

56:45.320 --> 56:48.232
sent to hunt down
the remaining signs of life.

56:49.280 --> 56:50.599
Like us.

56:56.360 --> 56:58.555
Okay. Oh, boy.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.433
That's bad.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.512
And that's worse.

57:08.720 --> 57:10.199
What's up there?

57:10.840 --> 57:12.876
Air filtration system.

57:13.720 --> 57:15.039
I can't...

57:15.680 --> 57:17.671
Something blocking the hatch.

57:20.240 --> 57:23.869
If we can't get it back on, we're gonna
run out of breathable air fast.

57:31.880 --> 57:34.075
You're the only one
small enough to reach it.

57:34.720 --> 57:35.789
Reach what?

57:35.880 --> 57:38.678
The filtration system.
Through there, the main duct.

57:38.760 --> 57:41.638
Someone needs to get in there
and restart it.

57:45.360 --> 57:46.475
Give me a hand.

57:47.200 --> 57:49.400
Let me go. She's not gonna
know her way around the unit.

57:49.480 --> 57:51.789
You won't fit. Plus your arm.
She'll be fine.

57:52.480 --> 57:56.632
Now, to restart the unit,
you just swing the handle off,

57:56.720 --> 57:59.029
then on, off, then on.

58:00.200 --> 58:01.679
That should do it.

58:04.400 --> 58:07.915
And neither of us will be able to go in
and help you if you get stuck.

58:11.600 --> 58:12.953
Don't get stuck.

58:54.280 --> 58:55.633
Michelle!

58:56.120 --> 58:57.314
Everything okay up there?

58:59.280 --> 59:01.191
It looks like a dead end.

59:01.280 --> 59:02.633
That's the incline.

59:02.720 --> 59:05.393
Climb up that and you're almost there.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.513
Ah, this sucks.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.828
What's wrong?

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.148
Howard.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.271
He lied, he lied about Megan.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.113
What do you mean?

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.110
I think he did something horrible to her.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.948
No, his family moved
to Chicago years ago.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.233
What's this?

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.632
Is that blood?

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.793
Here, come with me.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.876
Wait, that... That's not Megan.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.559
What do you mean?

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.232
Yeah. Her name is Brittany.
I remember her.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.470
She went to high school
with my little sister.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
She...

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.588
She went missing. Two years back.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.795
It was on the news and everything.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.791
Most people just thought
she skipped town.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.991
There was a message up there.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.075
It said "Help."

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.390
It was scratched
on the inside of the window.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.480
And this earring...

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.357
This earring was with it.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.113
Did she ever show back up
after she went missing?

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.752
He said to me... He said to my face,
that this was his daughter.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.671
He said this was Megan.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.272
He took her and he killed her.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.317
All right, let's just think.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.873
Maybe we take away his gun.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.160
Tie him up, get him to confess
to whatever it is he's done.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.430
Confess to who? The police?

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.118
Look, like I said,
we can't be the only survivors, right?

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.392
The woman,
she was able to get around, right?

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.480
At least a little.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.312
Yeah, until she died.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.960
Directly above us,
making choking noises.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.480
Of all the people to save us...

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.556
Now, that was
a great example of teamwork.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.758
Very well done. I feel like some music.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.712
Problem solving always puts me
in a musical mood.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.279
Michelle,

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.555
you should go shower, just in case.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.600
Sure.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.752
I think I might have an idea.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.993
"Ten Better Ways to Style My Bangs"?

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.832
No, not the article. This.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.790
I think I can only make one,
but it's a start.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.233
No kidding.

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.556
<i>What are you doing up?
I didn't wake you up yet.</i>

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.120
<i>Well, I'm fixing your breakfast.</i>

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.838
<i>One egg over medium.</i>

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.269
Hey, Howard.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.714
What is this?
You re-watching <i>Sixteen Candles?</i>

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.438
<i>Pretty in Pink.</i>

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.634
It was one of Megan's favorite movies.
Can I help you with something?

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.755
No.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.798
No, I'm just grabbing some water.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.228
Say, um...

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.715
You know, I was just thinking...

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.757
Not that I'm trying to tell you
how to run this place or anything.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.638
I'm just a little curious.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.388
Michelle...

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.799
Say, how close do you think she got
to that air filtration unit?

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.518
You think she touched it?

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.398
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she touched it.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.319
Well, I know she cleaned up
after and everything,

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.516
but I'm just thinking,

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.878
given that unit filters
God knows what through from outside,

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.748
if she tracked anything back in with her,
it'd be pretty concentrated.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:41.116
And, I mean, it could be
all over the shower and the sink

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.077
in your bathroom, right now.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.032
Anyway, it's just a thought.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.750
Not bad so far, partner.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.308
If Howard finds this,
he's gonna kill us.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.678
All right, so,
we get the gun away from him.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:32.193
All right. We tie him up,
make sure he isn't going anywhere.

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:35.430
And then one of us just

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.310
goes out and looks for help.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.068
Um...

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.709
First word.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.109
Uh...

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.349
Tiny.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:00.992
Small. Pygmy. Um...

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.828
- Little.
- Yep! Mmm-hmm.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:05.390
All right, uh, second word.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.511
Ooh! Michelle is a...

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.639
A girl.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.711
A girl. A child. Um...

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.240
A girl.

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:25.754
No, she's older, see, so she is a...

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:29.399
"Little Princess"?

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:38.749
Um... No, it was woman.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.673
Um, Little Women.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.318
Wow. Little woman.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.117
Next time,
try being a little more specific.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.033
Let's see here.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.592
I'm always watching.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.829
Always.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.319
Um...

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.279
God.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.437
I go wherever I want.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.915
Uh...

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.718
I mean... Well, I don't know.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.394
I know what you're doing.
I see what you're doing.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920
Um...

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.468
I know what you're up to.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.521
Look, Howard,
I don't know what you're getting at, but...

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.318
I see you when you're sleeping.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.993
I know what you're doing,
and I'm always watching.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.469
Always watching! I'm always watching!

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.828
Santa Claus!

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.748
You're Santa Claus.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.958
Yeah, Michelle, that's great.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.076
Except it was Emmett's turn.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.434
Sorry, I just got a little excited.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.351
Yeah, well, I'm keeping that point.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.993
Totally. You earned it.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.709
Emmett?

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.275
Hey.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.231
I need your help with something.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.589
Sure.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.115
You.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.199
On deck.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.233
What is this?

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.635
The barrel.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.839
What's in it?

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.511
Move it into the bathroom.

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.510
This is perchloric acid.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.153
Do either of you know what that is?

01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:00.875
It's usually produced as a precursor
to ammonium perchlorate,

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.513
a fuel

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.153
used for launching
naval satellites into orbit.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.791
It's highly corrosive.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.192
Dissolves most biological
material on contact.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:23.153
With humans, right down to the bone.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.155
Hey, Howard, uh,
what are you showing this to us for?

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.911
You think I'm an idiot?

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.232
Uh...

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.753
Howard, please,
you're gonna have to tell us

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.114
what it is that you're talking about.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.760
I'm talking about
getting rid of some waste.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.996
Tell me what you two
were doing with these.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.031
You tell me what you two
were planning, right now!

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.832
Howard, listen, just take it easy.
Take it easy.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.239
Howard, come on, please.

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.276
No. I'm giving you one chance.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.355
Hey.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.069
Howard, just calm down.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.948
One chance to answer
with some dignity, or I swear to God,

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.474
you're going into this barrel
while you're alive to feel it.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.754
It was me.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.038
All right? Not her. It's just me.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.633
- No, no, no, we...
- Stay out of this, all right?

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.870
She doesn't have a clue
what you're talking about.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.199
I wanted your gun.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.398
And so, I was thinking
about making a weapon

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.711
to get it from you.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.997
I want her to respect me
the way that she respects you.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.675
I'm not saying that I was right, okay?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.479
And I'm sorry.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.148
You're sorry?

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.593
I'm sorry.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.038
I accept your apology.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.513
Listen to me.
You heard him. You heard him.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.194
He was making a weapon.
He was gonna hurt us.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.794
He was gonna hurt you. And it's okay.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.593
This was the way
it was always supposed to be.

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:32.829
You're safe.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.390
Now it's just you and me.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.353
It's okay, you know.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.114
You should go to your room now.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.274
This next part isn't something
you need to see.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.349
Okay.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.269
Go on.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.999
Michelle?

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.749
Hey.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.560
I thought we'd change things up tonight

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.190
and have dessert before dinner.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:55.080
After all,
we can do whatever we want now.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:04.030
Would you like a cone or a bowl?

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.277
Megan always wanted hers in a bowl.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.396
She said the cones were too messy.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.913
I know that this isn't
the life you'd prefer,

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.032
that it isn't easy for
you living down here,

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.069
but I want us to be a happy family.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.233
You and me.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.071
The mess is all taken care of.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.675
So, just hang loose
and I'll go get dinner started.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.074
Michelle?

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.469
Everything all right?

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.030
Yeah, I was just about
to do some reading.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.714
Hmm.

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.632
It's time to set the table.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.313
Supper's ready.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.840
Yeah.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.600
Okay.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.430
It keeps doing that.
I don't know why.

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.080
Michelle, why is this loose?

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.836
- Get up.
- Why?

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.480
Get off the mattress now!

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.995
Oh, shit!

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.509
Michelle!

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.273
Stop! Goddamn it, get back here!

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.640
You gonna walk out on me?

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:20.389
After I saved you and kept you safe,
this is how you repay me.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.229
No.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.554
This is.

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.120
Michelle!

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.234
Stop!

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.235
You don't know what's out there.

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.631
You can't run from them!

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.033
Stay with me!

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.033
Let me go!

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.108
Oh, come on.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.837
Keys, keys, keys.

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.588
Come on, damn it!

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.358
Come on. Come on.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.070
Help! I'm out here! Help!

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.075
Oh, God.

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.559
Oh, fuck.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.358
<i>The military

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:22.431
