WEBVTT

00:02.870 --> 00:06.374
Oh, I don't know, do you want me
to hold your paintball trophy

00:06.474 --> 00:07.741
-while you open the door?
-Oh.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.078
Trophy-holding's
only for winners.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.180
Ouch.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.548
No, but, seriously,
today was so fun.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.850
What are you up to tomorrow?
You want to grab dinner?

00:16.950 --> 00:18.919
Uh, actually I can't.
I have to go to a thing

00:19.019 --> 00:21.289
with another woman.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.858
And now it's my turn
to say, "Ouch."

00:24.958 --> 00:26.360
I-It's my nonna.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.162
Uh, she's old-school Italian,

00:28.262 --> 00:30.131
so the two of us always do
Sunday dinner together.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.499
Uh, don't get jealous,

00:31.599 --> 00:33.467
but she does always
kiss me good night.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.403
I lived in Italy
for a few years.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.573
Sì, uh...

00:42.976 --> 00:45.746
[chuckles] Okay, someone only
learned the food words.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.482
Well, I couldn't cook.
How else was I supposed to eat?

00:48.582 --> 00:51.018
Tell me more
about this Sunday dinner.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.987
Nonna goes all out-- I mean,
Sunday sauce, handmade pasta.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.257
She spends the entire day
in the kitchen.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.959
How cool.
You know, I love dinner.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.795
And I'd love to meet
your grandmother.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.531
Uh... yeah.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.166
I'm not sure we're there yet.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.235
Oh, really?

01:07.335 --> 01:09.036
I mean, I just thought we were.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.239
Uh, yeah, no, it's ju--
it's just that her place is

01:11.339 --> 01:13.674
really, really small, so...

01:13.774 --> 01:15.809
Well, I'll make Sunday dinner.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.412
Didn't you just say
you can't cook?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.314
Well, I couldn't cook then,

01:20.414 --> 01:22.883
but now... I'm amazing.

01:22.983 --> 01:26.019
Handmade pasta?
I'm a master at that...

01:26.120 --> 01:28.422
cranky machine thingy.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.491
Come on, it'll be fun.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.959
Tomorrow night.

01:32.059 --> 01:34.094
Okay... sure. Yeah, uh,

01:34.195 --> 01:37.131
we'll see you tomorrow night
for dinner at Carly's Cucina.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.367
That means kitchen.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.202
Yes, it does.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.536
* I know *

01:42.636 --> 01:44.004
* You see *

01:44.104 --> 01:46.540
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

01:46.640 --> 01:49.610
* And be so wonderful *

01:49.710 --> 01:53.381
* So wake up
the members of my nation *

01:53.481 --> 01:55.583
* It's your time to be *

01:55.683 --> 01:58.619
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

01:58.719 --> 02:01.322
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

02:01.422 --> 02:04.592
* Of every situation *

02:04.692 --> 02:06.327
* Some things are meant to be *

02:06.427 --> 02:09.963
* So give your best
and leave the rest to me. *

02:11.999 --> 02:15.002
Spencer, can I host
a really important dinner party

02:15.102 --> 02:17.238
here tomorrow night,
so I can meet Wes's grandma?

02:17.338 --> 02:18.572
I can? Thank you.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.841
Ooh! Meeting the family?

02:20.941 --> 02:22.943
Sounds like you're
getting serious,

02:23.043 --> 02:25.379
like me and Maeve
and our perfect relationship.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.449
Oh, there's my Sleeping Beauty,

02:28.549 --> 02:31.051
freshly risen
from dozing the day away.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.820
Mmm. Well...

02:32.920 --> 02:35.589
I wouldn't need a nap
if my sweet baby

02:35.689 --> 02:37.591
didn't snore all night.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.594
Oh. I could've sworn
I was the one up all night,

02:40.694 --> 02:44.232
thanks
to your ocean noise machine.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.834
-Nothing more soothing than
the sounds of seagulls. -Mm.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.136
-Squawk! Squawk! [chuckles]
-Mmm.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.704
I love those birds.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.573
Maybe more than I love you.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.275
[chuckles softly]
Just kidding.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.943
[both laughing]

02:56.043 --> 02:58.846
-Bye. [chuckles]
-[both smooching]

03:00.581 --> 03:02.516
[smooches]

03:03.317 --> 03:04.385
See?

03:04.485 --> 03:06.153
Aren't we adorable?

03:06.254 --> 03:07.555
That was my nightmare.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.458
Seems like you burned right
through the honeymoon phase,

03:10.558 --> 03:11.992
and now you're
on to the next one.

03:12.092 --> 03:12.826
Which is what?

03:12.926 --> 03:14.462
The "smean" phase--

03:14.562 --> 03:16.196
where everything's mean...

03:16.297 --> 03:18.165
but with a smile.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.837
Carly, check it out--
the perfect look

03:23.937 --> 03:27.040
for Double Dutch's first music
video with a real budget.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.244
It's kaleidoscope like
her first single "Kaleidoscope."

03:30.344 --> 03:33.414
And it's tattered like
her second single "Tatters."

03:33.514 --> 03:35.583
And it's elegant
like her third single...

03:35.683 --> 03:37.585
-"Ugly."
-Uh...

03:37.685 --> 03:39.253
yeah, so ugly.

03:39.353 --> 03:42.122
Wow, the disrespect.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.425
Double Dutch is on the rise,

03:44.525 --> 03:47.261
and she's counting on me to help
her get to the next level.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.730
Like, where would Gaga be
without her meat dress?

03:49.830 --> 03:52.266
Or where would Katy Perry be
without her cupcake bra?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.902
Wait, should I be doing
something with food?

03:55.002 --> 03:57.338
I don't know, I don't want
to think about food.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.908
I invited Wes and his
grandmother over for dinner,

04:01.008 --> 04:03.611
and he said
we weren't there yet.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.178
But you've been on nine dates.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.847
I know. So after that,

04:06.947 --> 04:08.816
I pushed him just a little...

04:08.916 --> 04:11.419
and he said, "Sure."

04:11.519 --> 04:13.086
Ooh.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.355
I know.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.956
Now I have to make
this gourmet feast.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.025
-You don't cook.
-So I can impress his grandma.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.660
Who he didn't want you to meet.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.329
And then maybe
he'll define the relationship

04:21.429 --> 04:22.730
and ask me to be his girlfriend.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.097
You two haven't done that yet?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.567
Oh, I mean, yes!

04:26.667 --> 04:28.736
Great plan. Manifest, queen.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.372
But, look, you don't have
to pretend to cook.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.173
Just be your authentic self.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.775
[phone rings]

04:36.009 --> 04:37.345
[British accent]:
Hello, Harper Designs,

04:37.445 --> 04:39.813
Miss Pennyfeathers speaking.
How may I help you?

04:39.913 --> 04:40.948
[normal voice]:
It's Dutch.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.618
[British accent]: I'll see
if Miss Harper's available.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.820
Aw, Miss Pennyfeathers,

04:46.920 --> 04:48.922
the hardest-working
fake assistant in the biz.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.958
[normal voice]:
Mm-hmm. Dutch!

04:51.058 --> 04:52.526
How are you?

04:53.226 --> 04:55.062
I hear you're having
a dinner party,

04:55.162 --> 04:56.997
which is perfect timing because

04:57.097 --> 04:59.199
I just finished the beta version
of the app I'm developing.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.535
Can I give you
the Barracuda Boardroom pitch?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.604
Fine. I'll pretend
to be a wealthy,

05:03.704 --> 05:05.473
overly judgmental investor

05:05.573 --> 05:07.174
that can make or break you.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.443
[clears throat]

05:09.543 --> 05:11.278
Freddie Benson is
an app designer

05:11.379 --> 05:12.580
from Seattle, Washington.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.181
He's cool with fish,

05:14.281 --> 05:16.384
cruel with bedtimes,
and he's come here today

05:16.484 --> 05:19.653
to share an app that's going
to revolutionize cooking.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.855
Hey, Barracudas.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.657
Whipping up a big meal is hard.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.760
With all the different recipes
and ingredients and timing,

05:26.860 --> 05:28.596
who can keep it straight?

05:28.696 --> 05:31.131
That's why I created
Bon Appe-timer,

05:31.231 --> 05:34.001
the app that takes the guesswork
out of kitchen work.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.770
Just drag in your recipes
and the app alerts you

05:36.870 --> 05:38.606
every step of the way.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.908
This is exactly what I need.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.777
-Well, I'm in.
-You're right.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.647
Kaleidoscope, tatters,
elegance-- it's so passé.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.016
I don't know
why my assistant pulled that.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.218
[British accent]: Please
don't fire me, Miss Harper.

05:51.318 --> 05:54.522
I need this job
to feed me family.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.824
[normal voice]: All right,
I'll give you one last chance.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.727
Yeah, girl,
she been messing up a lot.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.934
I got to say, Freddie's app
is saving my butt.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.837
I couldn't decide between
rigatoni, ziti, or spaghetti,

06:09.937 --> 06:11.872
so I found a recipe
that uses them all.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.341
It's called Raviolo Maximo.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.710
It's the Turducken of pasta.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.812
Yeah, Turducken, yum.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.682
Wow, the disrespect.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.284
Sorry, I'm distracted.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.054
Dutch has hated the last five
looks I've shown her.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.022
If this one's not a hit,
I'm probably fired.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.558
Do you think she'll like this?

06:30.658 --> 06:32.826
Reminder, I am very fragile.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.595
Yeah, she's gonna love it.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.765
But if she doesn't, are you
just gonna bail on it again?

06:37.865 --> 06:39.232
If I want to keep my job!

06:39.332 --> 06:41.201
I can't just tell
Double Dutch what I think.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.937
But isn't that exactly
what you're hired to do?

06:44.037 --> 06:45.506
Carly...

06:45.606 --> 06:47.140
sweet Carly.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.776
You know nothing.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.513
I've been saying that for years.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.449
Oh, that reminds me.
Millicent, I am begging you,

06:55.549 --> 06:57.017
please be nice to me tonight.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.986
You got it, Aunt Carly.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.755
Wes really hit the jackpot
when he met you.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.758
Already bribed her?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.594
Yep. I wanted you to be able

07:06.694 --> 07:08.128
to focus on what matters
the most tonight.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.797
Defining my relationship
with Wes?

07:09.897 --> 07:11.799
No, the real star
of this evening--

07:11.899 --> 07:13.133
my app.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.635
[bell dings]

07:14.735 --> 07:16.403
-Ooh, pasta's ready.
-Great news!

07:16.504 --> 07:19.072
Figured out how to stay
in the honeymoon phase.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.742
I found this book How to Stay
in the Honeymoon Phase.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.043
Listen.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.745
"The first thing
you should know is that

07:24.845 --> 07:26.747
"for every relationship,
the honeymoon phase

07:26.847 --> 07:28.749
ends at some point."

07:28.849 --> 07:31.251
This book was written
by a mean liar.

07:32.185 --> 07:32.886
[knocking]

07:32.986 --> 07:34.688
Okay, he's here.

07:34.788 --> 07:38.291
Uh, remember, this dinner is
really important to me,

07:38.391 --> 07:40.994
so everyone be
on their best behavior.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.197
Welcome.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.734
Uh, sorry,
I came straight from work.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.669
Carly, this is my nonna Sylvia.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.437
[CARLY]:
It is so nice to meet you.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.640
Uh, this is my brother
Spencer, that's Freddie

07:52.740 --> 07:55.342
and his daughter Millicent,
and my roommate Harper.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.946
[ALL]:
Hello!

07:59.046 --> 08:02.650
What a nice-looking
bunch you are.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.653
And, Carly,
aren't you a stunner.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.254
Thank you, Sylvia.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.622
Oh, call me Nonna.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.358
-I'm gonna change real quick.
-I'll take your coat.

08:11.458 --> 08:14.094
-I'll finish setting the table.
-I'll get drinks.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.332
Well, I guess it's just me
and you, Nonna. [chuckles]

08:19.432 --> 08:22.770
Oh, good, because I have
something to tell you.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.938
I don't like you.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.379
This is a disaster.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.081
Wes's nonna hates me.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.316
If she doesn't like me, there's
not gonna be a relationship.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.085
-[bell dings]
-Aah!

08:38.185 --> 08:41.021
Time to layer the three pastas
inside the raviolo!

08:41.121 --> 08:44.091
Uh, Spencer, Harper,
go entertain Nonna.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.026
You got it.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.395
Don't leave it to the amateurs
when you've got

08:48.495 --> 08:51.198
a pro in the house.
Grannies can't resist

08:51.298 --> 08:53.366
this.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.303
Carly, I will not let you down.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.640
Wow. What did you
bribe her with?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.642
Bon Appe-timer stock options.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.744
She said it would round out
her portfolio.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.047
Hi, Nonna Sylvia. I'm Millicent.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.949
Want to see me do a cartwheel?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.317
I'd love to.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.985
Why don't you do
a few out in the hallway?

09:12.085 --> 09:14.087
But then you won't be able
to see me.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.989
Exactly.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.694
Yeah, you're screwed.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.163
[gasps] Oh!

09:23.263 --> 09:26.133
Here's my handsome Wesley!

09:26.233 --> 09:28.401
Carly? You're the angel

09:28.501 --> 09:31.705
I prayed would land
on this earth

09:31.805 --> 09:33.707
for my grandson.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.310
-She's really into praying.
-[chuckles]

09:37.410 --> 09:38.879
To who?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.249
-[bell dinging]
-Oh. Uh...

09:42.349 --> 09:45.018
Time to put the raviolo
in the oven.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.321
Wait, this doesn't make sense.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.057
How am I supposed
to put the raviolo in

09:50.157 --> 09:52.359
when the garlic bread's already
baking at another temperature?

09:52.459 --> 09:54.594
-Hang on a second.
-Okay.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.230
-Uh, here.
-[phone rings]

09:57.330 --> 09:58.666
Oh.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.400
[British accent]:
Hello, Harper Designs.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.302
May I place you on a brief hold?

10:02.402 --> 10:04.905
[vocalizing]

10:09.176 --> 10:10.277
At least Spencer's still there.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.512
-[MAEVE]: Spencer!
-Got to go.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.516
Great news,
nothing wrong with the app.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.218
It was user error.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.921
How do people on TV make
dinner parties look so easy?

10:21.021 --> 10:24.024
That Barefoot Contessa is
a lying she-devil.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.058
Do you need some help, chef?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.559
Oh, no need.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.361
Everything's running smoothly.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.363
I'm very impressive.
[chuckles]

10:31.364 --> 10:32.933
Wow.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.236
Look at all these people that
no one told me were coming over,

10:36.336 --> 10:38.772
my little social butterfly.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.341
It's almost like you heard them,
knew they were here,

10:41.441 --> 10:43.276
and chose not to say hi,

10:43.376 --> 10:45.012
my precious hermit crab.

10:45.112 --> 10:48.115
What a fun, little play
you must be rehearsing for.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.451
Since nobody fights
at important dinner parties.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.622
[BOTH]:
Love you! [smooching]

10:59.192 --> 11:00.493
Big problem.

11:00.593 --> 11:01.962
There's a problem?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.330
-Here, I can help you.
-Oh, no. No, you can't.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.431
'Cause there's no problem.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.399
You're not gonna leave, are you?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.836
Of course not.
Dutch is coming here.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.438
-What? When?
-[knocking]

11:11.538 --> 11:13.774
Now-ish? Look,

11:13.874 --> 11:15.308
I promise it'll be real quick.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.144
She insisted on seeing
her video outfit in person.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.013
Carly, if I don't nail this
assignment, I could lose my job.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.916
Okay,
just keep it inconspicuous.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.618
Of course. Nonna won't
even know that she's here.

11:26.619 --> 11:32.592
* Hello... *

11:32.692 --> 11:35.228
I assume everyone knows
who I am. No.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.696
I don't need your names.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.631
I will call all of you
Josephine,

11:38.732 --> 11:41.701
after my sister,
whoms I don't like.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.172
Please-please tell me this is
not the outfit you wanted me

11:45.272 --> 11:46.807
-to see.
-Uh... [laughs]

11:46.907 --> 11:48.842
This dumb thing?
[scoffs]

11:48.942 --> 11:50.811
No! No.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.580
I don't think it's dumb.
I think it...

11:53.680 --> 11:55.315
It's smoking!

11:55.415 --> 11:57.650
It's on fire!

12:00.687 --> 12:03.090
Dinner is moments away.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.724
[chuckles]

12:04.825 --> 12:06.860
You screwed me, Benson.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.529
You had the garlic bread
too close to the broiler.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.564
That's not on me.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.103
Ugh! Where is my outfit?

12:16.203 --> 12:17.871
The shoot is tomorrow.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.440
Um, I'm gonna be
totally honest with you.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.377
My assistant Miss Pennyfeathers
is on her way with it.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.179
Okay, well, how far is she?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.448
'Cause I was already hungry,
and now the smell

12:28.548 --> 12:31.584
of charred garlic bread
has me ravenous.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.320
Oh, well, do you want to...?

12:33.420 --> 12:34.687
Stay for dinner?

12:34.788 --> 12:36.824
Oh, I would love to!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.826
* Feed me, feed me *

12:38.926 --> 12:40.593
* If you really need me! *

12:40.693 --> 12:41.995
That just came out of me.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.696
Carly...

12:43.797 --> 12:45.799
do you mind if Dutch stays
for dinner?

12:45.899 --> 12:47.700
Oh, cool.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.702
An unexpected guest,

12:49.803 --> 12:52.572
who also happens to be a
high-maintenance indie darling,

12:52.672 --> 12:55.976
at the most important dinner
of my life.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.611
[laughing]

12:59.379 --> 13:01.614
We're having fun!

13:03.616 --> 13:06.386
Um, I'm not a huge fan
of tomatoes,

13:06.486 --> 13:08.288
so I'm not gonna do the pasta.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.857
Um, but it's okay. Don't worry.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.392
I will just take whatever
the chef's alternate meal is.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.962
[smooches]
Thank you, Josephine.

13:17.664 --> 13:20.267
You screwed me, too,
Bettencourt.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.538
[chuckles] Carly,
if you don't let me help,

13:25.638 --> 13:27.207
I'll never come over again.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.741
Okay, fine.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.944
Um, could you just make sure
that there...?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.880
Serving spoons? Already got 'em.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.749
What are you wearing?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.351
Something downright adorable

13:38.451 --> 13:40.253
to make that old broad like me.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.554
Ah.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.094
Well, hello, Mrs. Wes's Grandma.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.062
I was hoping that we could
sit next to each other

13:49.162 --> 13:51.764
during dinner, and you could
tell me about the good old days.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.666
Oh, I would love to.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.768
There was this glorious time

13:55.869 --> 13:57.604
a few minutes ago

13:57.704 --> 13:59.606
when you weren't here.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.342
It's official.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.077
I've lost my mojo.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.581
[bell dings]

14:09.616 --> 14:12.185
"Meal complete. You are done."

14:12.285 --> 14:14.221
I am? That was so fast!

14:15.155 --> 14:17.690
-[sighs]
-Moment of truth.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.201
Uh... is it supposed to be...

14:28.301 --> 14:29.937
pulsating?

14:30.037 --> 14:32.906
The pulsating's
how you know it's done.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.208
I did it.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.844
I can't believe I did it.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.880
Everyone, let's eat!

14:41.748 --> 14:42.882
Oh!

14:42.983 --> 14:45.885
This is a beautiful table!

14:45.986 --> 14:49.556
And look at the pulsation
on that raviolo!

14:49.656 --> 14:52.159
Thank you, Nonna.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.428
Uh, Maeve, my sweet love, would
you like to sit next to me?

14:55.528 --> 14:56.629
No.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.633
I'm really happy we did this.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.403
I knew we were ready.

15:04.104 --> 15:07.274
I just love seeing all your
faces around the table.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.508
It's so great that...

15:08.608 --> 15:10.978
-[coughing]
-She's choking!

15:11.078 --> 15:13.813
Nonna's choking! Here, get up!

15:13.913 --> 15:16.883
Okay.
[screaming]

15:18.851 --> 15:20.720
Let go of me!

15:20.820 --> 15:22.689
[whimpering]

15:22.789 --> 15:24.157
What are you doing?

15:24.257 --> 15:25.558
You were choking!

15:25.658 --> 15:27.660
-Are you okay?
-I wasn't choking.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.696
I ate a bite of raw sausage

15:29.796 --> 15:32.966
and was trying to spit it out,
when this one jumped on me!

15:33.066 --> 15:35.035
I thought you were dying!

15:35.135 --> 15:38.205
I'm sorry, did you say
"raw sausage"?

15:42.009 --> 15:43.943
I have a broken rib.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.379
And I have a broken app.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.848
I am so, so sorry.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.018
I need to lie down.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.286
Uh, you can use my place.
Here, I'll take you.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.887
Aah! Don't touch me!

15:54.988 --> 15:57.890
Yeah, Carly. I'll take her.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.030
[DUTCH]:
So...

16:03.130 --> 16:05.398
do you think it's safe
to eat the salad?

16:11.071 --> 16:12.772
Well, this seals it.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.941
I don't think Wes wants
to be in a relationship

16:15.042 --> 16:17.110
with an elder abuser.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.046
Come on, I'm sure
his grandma's fine.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.614
That's why we have so many ribs.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.583
Oh, I could go for some ribs!

16:23.683 --> 16:25.418
I'm just gonna say
what everyone's thinking.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.754
-Outback.
-Chili's.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.860
Okay, I can't just sit here
feeling sorry for myself.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.030
I'm gonna go apologize
to Wes and Sylvia.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.366
[dog whines]

16:40.300 --> 16:42.202
Aw! Who's this little guy?

16:42.302 --> 16:44.104
Her name is Kevin.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.806
And she lives in my purse.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.408
And now...

16:48.508 --> 16:51.611
she lives in my lap.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.546
Can I talk to you
really quick over...?

16:53.646 --> 16:55.014
Oh, yeah.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.783
You want to order a pizza?
Anything but pineapple.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.319
Unless you like pineapple,
in which case, mahalo.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.953
I'm starting to think
that your assistant

17:01.054 --> 17:02.355
isn't coming with my outfit.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.023
No, she's coming.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.725
Uh, maybe
her quintuplets got sick.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.195
Or she had to take her baby
to the airport.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.462
Look, if you and I
can't work together

17:09.562 --> 17:11.198
like a well-oiled machine,

17:11.298 --> 17:12.732
I'm gonna have
to hire someone else.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.068
Well-oiled machine?

17:15.168 --> 17:17.704
Wes's coveralls. Wait, hold
that thought. I need to work.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.640
-If-if that's okay with you.
-Yes, go!

17:20.740 --> 17:24.311
I'll fire Miss Pennyfeathers
when she gets here.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.515
Nonna Sylvia?

17:28.615 --> 17:31.551
I'll let you sleep.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.554
I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

17:36.022 --> 17:39.859
And... I lied about
knowing how to cook.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.896
I just wanted to impress Wes.

17:43.996 --> 17:47.600
And you, 'cause you mean
so much to him.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.037
And I like him a lot.

17:51.138 --> 17:53.606
Like, a lot a lot.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.842
Sorry, maybe that's
too many lots.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.444
I like him a sane amount.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.550
I just really hope that maybe
you can forgive me.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.352
And...

18:05.452 --> 18:06.853
Oh, no.

18:06.953 --> 18:10.723
Why is your hand
so cold and clammy?

18:10.823 --> 18:13.160
Nonna? Nonna?

18:13.260 --> 18:15.094
Oh, my God.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.896
This can't be happening.

18:16.996 --> 18:19.266
Okay, I-I can do this.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.868
I saw a CPR video online once.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.506
-Clear!
-[both screaming]

18:27.607 --> 18:29.742
-Get off of me!
-Oh, my God!

18:29.842 --> 18:31.444
Wes!

18:31.544 --> 18:32.945
She tried to kill me again!

18:33.045 --> 18:35.114
No! No, no, no.
I was trying to save you.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.649
Carly, what are you doing?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.551
I-I'm sorry.
I thought she was dead!

18:38.651 --> 18:40.653
-Well, I'm not!
-A-And I'm glad!

18:40.753 --> 18:42.855
I am so glad you're not dead.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.157
[chuckles]

18:44.257 --> 18:45.958
Again.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.427
Come on, Harper.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.762
Let's see it.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.967
May I present...

18:55.067 --> 18:56.536
Greased Lightning.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.171
Aah! No, you may not.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.572
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.842
I don't love Grease.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.444
First of all,

19:04.544 --> 19:07.480
you need to put some respect
on Olivia Newton-John's name.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.949
-Oh.
-And second of all,

19:10.049 --> 19:11.618
this is the look.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.221
It says you are
the well-oiled machine.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.088
You're in the driver's seat.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.690
-Skrr, skrr.
-Oh. Oh.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.692
-You leave the competition
in the dust. -Ooh.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.661
Honey, you're miles ahead.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.996
Oh! Okay, enough car puns.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.766
I'm into it.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.801
You are? Um, I mean,
of course you are.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.203
It's so Dutch.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.371
Oh!

19:31.471 --> 19:33.105
I love Dutch.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.743
Where has this Harper been
this whole time?

19:36.843 --> 19:39.111
Terrified of losing her job.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.748
Aw. Well...

19:42.649 --> 19:45.652
...maybe she can be
slightly less terrified.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.854
She loves that for her.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.127
There you are.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.765
This is where I go
when I need to get some air.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.369
Did we move too fast?

20:02.469 --> 20:04.871
Only according
to everyone we know.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.439
[chuckles]

20:06.539 --> 20:08.475
I mean, I built you the Titanic
for our first date.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.543
Do you think
that was a bad omen?

20:12.011 --> 20:15.114
I love you, Maeve,
but I think we need some space.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.083
Hmm. Of course we do.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.652
Because my immature sweetie
has never been

20:19.752 --> 20:22.389
in a real relationship before.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.924
Because my honey bunny
has trust issues

20:25.024 --> 20:27.360
from lying to her friends
and family for four years.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.895
[chuckles]

20:30.663 --> 20:33.900
I guess we both got
some growing up to do.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.036
Maybe one day we can grow back
towards each other.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.439
Hmm. I'd like that.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.674
I'm not gonna live
on a boat. No.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.384
You okay, Spence?

20:51.484 --> 20:53.853
[both coughing]

21:06.333 --> 21:08.668
Nonna's waiting in the car.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.571
So... I should head out.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.641
I'd say today was fun, but...

21:14.741 --> 21:16.409
I know it wasn't.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.545
And I'd say see you later,

21:18.645 --> 21:21.448
but I know you're
never gonna call me.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.583
You were right.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.184
We weren't ready.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.586
Carly...

21:26.686 --> 21:28.721
no one is ready
to meet my nonna.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.257
You probably didn't notice
'cause I told her

21:31.358 --> 21:33.826
to be on her best behavior...

21:33.926 --> 21:36.496
but she can be a serious pill.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.698
I don't think so.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.067
Most pills have
healing properties.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.435
[chuckles]

21:42.535 --> 21:43.970
You know...

21:44.070 --> 21:46.506
my last girlfriend
would have let her choke.

21:46.606 --> 21:50.176
Are you saying
that I'm your girlfriend?

21:51.678 --> 21:54.080
Does this answer your question?

21:58.317 --> 22:01.688
-Not really. I mean, am I your
girlfriend? -How about this?

22:05.057 --> 22:06.526
[horn honking]

22:06.626 --> 22:09.095
Damn it, Nonna,
stop salting my game.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.200
Mmm.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.469
Can't go wrong
with spaghetti tacos.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.805
Mm-hmm.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.408
This was so worth the wait.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.043
You know what, I get it now.

22:24.143 --> 22:27.847
* Feed me, feed me
a spaghetti taco *

22:27.947 --> 22:29.682
-Yes.
-* But not *

22:29.782 --> 22:32.051
* In that outfit. *

22:32.919 --> 22:34.754
Kevin, I know we just met
a few minutes ago,

22:34.854 --> 22:36.689
but would you be interested
in moving in with me?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.791
I'll build you a boat.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.394
Kevin's more
of an independent woman,

22:41.494 --> 22:43.129
but if you want,

22:43.229 --> 22:45.031
you can watch her tomorrow
during my video shoot.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.833
[gasps]
I would love that.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.401
This little lady's
gonna help me through

22:48.501 --> 22:49.636
the toughest day of my life.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.571
You know, studies have shown

22:51.671 --> 22:53.773
that petting a dog
is very therapeutic.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.508
Unless your allergic.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.677
Then you'll just get hives.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.547
And too bad there's no way
to connect people who need

23:00.647 --> 23:02.381
pet sitters with...

23:02.482 --> 23:04.617
people who need
therapy animals.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.987
Like an Airbnb but for pets.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.556
[gasps]

23:09.656 --> 23:11.424
I'll call the app...

23:11.524 --> 23:13.760
Kevin.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.963
Yeah, I need her back now.
