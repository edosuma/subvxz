02:11.131 --> 02:12.464
Yeah, baby.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.819
Hi, I'm Dixie. Dixie Normous.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.576
I may just be a small-town
FBI agent-slash-single mother...

02:40.827 --> 02:43.662
...but I'm still tough and sexy.

02:44.289 --> 02:48.834
Well, Miss Normous, shall we shag now...

02:49.002 --> 02:50.252
...or shag later?

02:50.420 --> 02:53.505
Oh, Austin, behave.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.303
Hey, Powers.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.306
You better watch your frigging self...

03:02.474 --> 03:06.894
...because this is one doctor
who does make house calls.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.107
Right, Mini Me?

03:12.484 --> 03:14.526
Hey, assholes.

03:16.821 --> 03:21.033
I'm right over here. I'm Mini Me.
Come and get me.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.209
And cut.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.211
That's a cut, everybody.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.421
Moving on. Check the gate, please.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.219
So, Austin, what'd you think
of the opening credits?

03:40.387 --> 03:42.554
Well, I can't believe
Sir Steven Spielberg...

03:42.722 --> 03:45.057
...the grooviest filmmaker
in the history of cinema...

03:45.225 --> 03:48.227
...is making a movie about my life.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.771
Very shagadelic, baby. Yeah.

03:52.774 --> 03:56.068
Having said that,
I do have some thoughts.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.736
Really?

03:57.904 --> 04:01.657
Uh, my friend here
thinks it's fine the way it is.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.826
Well, no offense, Sir Stevie...

04:03.994 --> 04:07.830
...but you've got to have mojo, baby.
Yeah.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.581
Hit it.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.653
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Quincy Jones.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.825
Yeah.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.540
This is where the movie
gets its mojo, baby.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.918
Groovy, yes.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.475
Quiet, everybody. Music video, take two.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.310
It's Britney Spears.

06:45.238 --> 06:50.033
Oops, I did it again, baby. Yeah.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.421
I love you!

07:15.268 --> 07:16.935
Yeah.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.915
Welcome back, Herr Doctor.
How was space?

07:38.082 --> 07:40.918
Space was cool. Wasn't it, Mini Me?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.880
Dr. Evil, while you were in space...

07:45.048 --> 07:48.634
...I created a way for us to make
huge sums of legitimate money...

07:48.801 --> 07:52.387
...and still maintain the ethics
and the business practices...

07:52.555 --> 07:54.389
...of an evil organization.

07:54.557 --> 07:58.977
I have turned us into a talent agency:
The Hollywood Talent Agency.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.147
- Really?
- By charging A-list clients 9 percent...

08:02.315 --> 08:05.734
...rather than the traditional 10 percent,
we've been able to sign such stars...

08:05.902 --> 08:07.444
...as George Clooney...

08:07.612 --> 08:09.321
Julia Roberts...
- Hey.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.073
...and Leo DiCaprio.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.574
Leo.

08:12.742 --> 08:17.496
And the best part of the whole scheme
is we all get our own assistants.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.498
Hi, I'm Number Three.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.458
Whoa!

08:21.876 --> 08:24.753
I'm really excited to be part of the team
here at HTA.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.588
Very impressive, Number Two...

08:27.590 --> 08:30.676
...but I finally have the perfect plan.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.471
In the '70s, there lived
a Dutch metallurgical hedonist...

08:34.639 --> 08:36.139
...by the name of Johann van der Smut.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.683
He loved gold so much...

08:38.851 --> 08:42.145
...he even lost his genitalia
in an unfortunate smelting accident.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.231
Hence the name...

08:44.524 --> 08:45.774
...Goldmember.

08:47.151 --> 08:49.111
He invented a cold-fusion power unit...

08:49.279 --> 08:52.197
...for a "tractor beam"...

08:53.366 --> 08:54.950
"Tractor beam"...

08:55.159 --> 08:57.494
...powerful enough
to pull a meteor to Earth.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.121
The meteor was called...

08:59.747 --> 09:02.040
..."Midas 22."

09:02.709 --> 09:04.209
It's made of solid gold.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.836
Is he sleeping?

09:06.379 --> 09:07.713
Well, that's okay.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.423
I guess Mini Me won't get any...

09:09.590 --> 09:11.258
...chocolate!

09:13.177 --> 09:16.388
You want down, Mini Me?
Use your words like a big boy clone.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.810
He's okay.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.063
Here's the chocolate.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.400
It's from Bruges. That's in Belgium.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.777
That's where Daddy's from. Yeah.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.908
Check out Mini Me.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.746
Yeah. He's gone mental
on account of the chocolate.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.582
It's like fricking catnip for clones.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.960
- Your chair, Dr. Evil.
- Thank you.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.754
Whoa!

09:58.848 --> 10:01.099
Thanks. Skedaddle. Right.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.851
You know, when you have kids...

10:03.019 --> 10:05.812
...I think you're gonna find
that all kids are different, eh?

10:11.611 --> 10:14.613
For example, Mini Me loves chocolate.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.114
Scotty don't.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.450
- What, I like chocolate fine, I just...
- Scotty don't.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.787
Well, this is very familiar. Hang on,
let me do what I do. "Uh, would you stop?"

10:23.289 --> 10:24.623
How about I what?

10:24.999 --> 10:26.541
What are you...?

10:26.709 --> 10:29.461
I don't even... Honestly, isn't this...?

10:29.629 --> 10:32.172
How about you don't?
Ladies and gentlemen, Scotty Don't.

10:32.340 --> 10:36.885
Ahem. Dr. Evil, perhaps it's time
that you finished unveiling your plan.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.472
Yes, thank you, Number Two.
Ladies and gentlemen, my plan is...

10:40.640 --> 10:43.392
- Scotty don't.
- Come on. You're such a lame-ass.

10:52.693 --> 10:53.777
- Yeah.
Oh, this is...

10:53.945 --> 10:56.238
- Yeah, yeah.
Oh, so we're...

10:56.406 --> 10:59.574
You know, this is causing me
serious psychological harm.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.493
I don't know. Who am I?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.787
Fine. You know what?
I would love some chocolate.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.122
Here you go.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.957
Thank you. Perfect.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.756
Heel, Mini Me.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.508
Heel.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.428
Come on. Got me a marlin. Yeah.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.515
You okay, Mini Me?

11:23.683 --> 11:26.268
Yeah? Did I pull too hard?
I don't want to hurt you.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.270
- Dr. Evil.
- Yeah?

11:28.438 --> 11:31.189
What does Goldmember's plan
have to do with us?

11:31.357 --> 11:34.943
Our early attempts at a tractor beam
went through several preparations.

11:35.111 --> 11:39.197
Preparations A through G were a failure.
But now, ladies and gentlemen...

11:39.365 --> 11:43.910
...we finally have a working tractor beam
which we shall call:

11:44.120 --> 11:46.705
"Preparation H."

11:48.416 --> 11:49.666
What?

11:49.834 --> 11:52.878
Why don't you just call it
"Operation Ass Cream", you ass.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.672
I'm sorry, did you want some ice cream?

11:55.840 --> 11:59.050
Yes. I'd love some chocolate ass cream.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.511
Perhaps later.

12:01.679 --> 12:05.182
- Dr. Evil, I love your plan.
- Yeah, eh?

12:05.349 --> 12:08.185
Ja, Herr Doctor, it's a really good plan.

12:08.352 --> 12:11.646
Yes, Frau, on the whole,
I think Preparation H feels good.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.776
- What is it now?
- No, nothing. You know what, I agree.

12:16.944 --> 12:21.156
Preparation H does feel good on the hole.

12:21.324 --> 12:24.951
Well, I'm glad we're sprechen Sie
the same lingitty, ja.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.369
Ladies and gentlemen...

12:27.538 --> 12:30.916
...using my time machine,
I shall travel back to 1975...

12:31.083 --> 12:34.002
...pick up Goldmember
and bring him back to the future.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.255
And the best part of this plan is...

12:37.465 --> 12:39.591
...no one can stop me.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.593
Not even...

12:41.761 --> 12:44.137
...Austin Powers.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.275
Not so fast.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.361
You're surrounded, Dr. Evil.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.697
Shit.

13:03.991 --> 13:08.954
Dr. Evil, the World Court
sentences you to 400 years.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.622
Do you have anything to say?

13:10.790 --> 13:14.334
No, but I think Mini Me does.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.756
Order! I will have order!

13:20.341 --> 13:22.717
Looks like two eggs in a hanky.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.682
The criminal genius known as Dr. Evil
and his clone...

13:28.891 --> 13:31.184
...were sentenced today
at the World Organization.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.478
For his efforts, Austin Powers...

13:33.646 --> 13:35.689
...son of England's most famous spy,
Nigel Powers...

13:35.856 --> 13:39.317
...will be knighted by the queen
at Buckingham Palace.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.489
Arise, Sir Austin Powers.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.117
Thank you, Your Majesty.

13:47.285 --> 13:51.496
- Your father must be very proud of you.
- Oh, yeah.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.000
Come on, Dad, stand up and take a bow.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.631
Daddy?

14:03.551 --> 14:04.884
Dad?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.653
Daddy

14:25.698 --> 14:28.366
Daddy wasn't there

14:31.704 --> 14:33.371
Daddy

14:35.291 --> 14:37.584
Daddy wasn't there

14:37.752 --> 14:40.045
To take me to the fair

14:40.212 --> 14:45.008
It seems he doesn't care

14:45.176 --> 14:46.885
Daddy wasn't there

14:50.973 --> 14:53.350
When I was first baptized
When I was criticized

14:53.517 --> 14:55.685
When I was ostracized
When I was Jazzercised

14:55.853 --> 14:58.188
Steak and kidney pies
One-hour Martinize

14:58.356 --> 15:01.024
When I was circumcised

15:01.192 --> 15:03.401
Daddy wasn't there

15:03.569 --> 15:05.528
To take me to the fair

15:05.946 --> 15:08.031
To change my underwear

15:08.616 --> 15:10.367
Daddy wasn't there

15:10.951 --> 15:12.327
"Daddy Wasn't There." Peace.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.748
I am a sexy beast.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.916
Yes.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.379
Bangs. Yes, how's it going?

15:22.546 --> 15:24.255
The robot. Haven't seen that in a while.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.552
- It's Austin Powers! You so funny.
Well, you know.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.139
Also, very sexiful. Can I have autograph?

15:33.349 --> 15:35.725
Of course. Your name is...?

15:35.893 --> 15:37.435
Fook Mi.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.523
Oh, behave, baby. Yes.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.109
- Now, your name is...?
- Fook Mi.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.944
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

15:46.779 --> 15:50.365
Fook Mi. Like this.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.325
Oh, I see!

15:52.493 --> 15:54.786
Your name is Fook Mi.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.122
- You want drink?
- Yes, of course.

15:57.289 --> 16:01.000
You know, I have a private bar in the back
that you're more than welcome to use...

16:01.168 --> 16:02.877
Here you go.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.255
Fook Mi, that was fast.

16:05.423 --> 16:06.464
Fook Yu.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.800
You're going the right way
for a smacked bottom...

16:08.968 --> 16:11.261
...and I don't care who knows it.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.012
Austin.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.268
This is my twin sister. Her name Fook Yu.

16:18.519 --> 16:19.936
Fook Yu.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.604
Fook Mi.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.814
See?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.649
Twins. Twins.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.030
Twins. Yes.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.825
We're going to see the twins. Yes.

16:36.203 --> 16:40.123
I also think Austin Powers very sexiful.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.667
We think you are very gravy, baby.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.711
Do we make you sleepy?

16:44.920 --> 16:47.672
Well, you make me many things,
but sleepy's not one of them.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.050
We give you top-secret massage.

16:51.218 --> 16:55.555
Yes, top-secret massage, baby.

16:58.601 --> 16:59.893
Sorry about that.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.645
I swear to God that never happens.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.689
Yes, hold on a tic.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.483
Okay...

17:10.362 --> 17:13.698
Okay. Now, where were we, babies? Yes.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.246
Ah, Austin. I'm sorry to interrupt.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.540
Twins, Basil. Twins.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.167
Austin, it's your father.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.377
- Bye-bye.
- What?

17:26.545 --> 17:28.213
- Bye.
- He's been kidnapped.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.550
Very heavy, man.

17:32.718 --> 17:36.846
Oh. So that's why my father
wasn't at the knighting ceremony.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.431
Well, no, actually.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.392
He was kidnapped
affer you were knighted.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.896
He was last seen on his yacht.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.565
Ah, yes, the HMS Shag-at-Sea.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.818
Exactly. Just take a look.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.152
Gentlemen, fall in.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.156
Austin, these men were assigned
to guard your father.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.700
Okay, chaps. Chins up, trousers down.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.662
I think we may have found a clue.

18:02.122 --> 18:06.209
Cor blimey. All your privates
have had their privates painted gold.

18:06.377 --> 18:07.836
How bizarre.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.004
Imagine, gilded tallywhackers...

18:10.172 --> 18:13.299
...golden wedding tackle,
14-karat trouser snakes...

18:13.467 --> 18:15.260
- That's enough.
- Okay.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.054
Basil, there's only one person
in the world...

18:18.222 --> 18:22.308
...who truly understands
the psychology of a madman.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.270
Dr. Evil.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.044
I've been expecting you, Mr. Powers.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.963
My father is missing.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.799
Yes, I heard. How ironic.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.887
You finally caught me,
yet now you need me more than ever.

18:59.054 --> 19:02.724
But then again, you've always needed me,
haven't you, Mr. Powers?

19:02.892 --> 19:06.561
Remember when I told you
we're not so different, you and I?

19:07.396 --> 19:10.064
We're not so different, you and I.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.901
See? I did say that.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.904
Very clever. Now, who has my father?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.949
Someone has some daddy issues.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.076
Nothing could be my father from the truth.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.495
Ooh! You said, "my father."

19:24.663 --> 19:26.831
- No, I dadn't.
- Hey-oh!

19:26.999 --> 19:28.249
Didn't. Did not.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.500
She-ba.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.086
- For me, this is a dad issue.
- Ha...

19:32.254 --> 19:33.338
Dead issue. Dead dad.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.257
Deadbeat dad. Daddy didn't love me.

19:37.009 --> 19:41.554
It seems the knighting ceremony
wasn't the only time...

19:42.097 --> 19:44.849
...your daddy let you down.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.229
Remember that day at the academy?

19:50.397 --> 19:52.065
Think.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.610
It was graduation.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.911
Yeah, baby, yeah.
Do I make you horny, baby?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.704
Oh, yes, that's the spot. Right there.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.248
You're a naughty one. Yes, you are.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.501
Hello, vicar. Crikey!

20:12.419 --> 20:14.671
Have you ever heard of knocking, man?

20:14.838 --> 20:16.631
Right.

20:16.799 --> 20:18.383
We were just getting started.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.259
Bye, love.

20:20.427 --> 20:24.305
Don't forget, Master Powers,
later you have a brief oral exam.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.600
Well, I hope it's mostly oral and not too...

20:28.227 --> 20:30.937
...brief, baby.

20:31.146 --> 20:34.565
You know, "brief" and "oral exam"...

20:36.777 --> 20:38.820
Marks are in, lads.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.491
It looks like Master Evil
is the top contender...

20:43.659 --> 20:46.244
...for this year's
International Man of Mystery.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.829
He's number one in the class.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.914
Whoop-de-do, Basil.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.001
Hey, everybody, I'm number one.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.335
Who cares?

20:54.545 --> 20:56.838
Hello, I'm Number Two.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.756
Nice to meet you, Number Two...

20:58.924 --> 21:03.261
...but now I'm going to be named
this year's International Man of Mystery.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.762
Yeah, right.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.146
Shut your gob.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.443
Who throws a cupcake? Honestly.

21:21.739 --> 21:25.116
And now it's time to award
our greatest honor.

21:25.993 --> 21:29.203
This year's International
Man of Mystery is...

21:29.830 --> 21:31.914
...Austin Powers.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.709
Well done, Austin.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.008
Jolly good.
Top notch.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.886
We're proud of you.
Very well done, indeed.

21:47.014 --> 21:51.142
It's always been my dream
to win this award, just like my dad.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.311
And I'm glad he could be here.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.772
Stand up, Dad. Take a bow.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.488
Dad?

22:06.325 --> 22:07.658
Daddy?

22:17.669 --> 22:19.378
Boo-frickity-hoo.

22:19.546 --> 22:23.174
I had the best grades in the class
and I didn't get diddlysquat.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.760
- Here we go.
- Tell me, Mr. Powers...

22:25.928 --> 22:27.678
...what did you find on those sailors?

22:27.846 --> 22:32.350
A golden surprise, perhaps?

22:32.935 --> 22:35.520
How did...? Yes.

22:35.687 --> 22:39.690
All the sailors had their
meat and two veg painted gold.

22:39.858 --> 22:43.277
Yes, it's the distinctive calling card
of a criminal mastermind.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.571
The aptly named...

22:46.907 --> 22:49.117
...Goldmember.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.287
How can I find this Goldmember?

22:54.873 --> 22:56.874
Quid pro quo, Mr. Powers.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.545
Yes, squid pro row.

23:01.171 --> 23:06.050
I'll give you Goldmember, you give me
a transfer to a regular prison...

23:06.218 --> 23:09.804
...so that I could be with
my beloved Mini Me.

23:10.013 --> 23:13.266
Okay, I'll get you a transfer
to a regular prison.

23:13.433 --> 23:14.809
Now, where's Goldmember?

23:14.977 --> 23:17.228
Not where, Mr. Powers...

23:17.396 --> 23:18.813
...but when.

23:18.981 --> 23:23.734
1975. Studio 69 Disco. New York City.
Corner of 69th and 8th.

23:24.611 --> 23:26.320
You go now, Mr. Powers.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.698
Fly, fly.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.957
I'll get it.

23:44.882 --> 23:48.342
Instead of hiding your father
in some remote location...

23:48.552 --> 23:51.095
...Goldmember is hiding him in 1975.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.557
So our engineers
have crafted this vehicle...

23:54.725 --> 23:56.893
...to time-travel to the '70s.

23:57.060 --> 24:00.605
Smashing, Basil. A pimpmobile.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.774
Oh, yes, yes.
I knew it would tickle your fancy.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.068
What can I say? Look.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.278
Cough.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.866
Here we go, 1975.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.117
Good luck, Austin.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.119
1975!

24:15.287 --> 24:17.622
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

24:58.830 --> 25:01.165
Solid Gold

25:03.001 --> 25:05.294
Solid Gold

25:05.712 --> 25:08.839
It's gold, it's gold
It's gold, it's gold

25:09.007 --> 25:11.717
It's solid gold, baby

25:14.429 --> 25:17.473
It's gold, it's gold
It's gold, it's gold

25:17.641 --> 25:20.643
It's solid gold, baby

25:20.811 --> 25:22.436
Yeah

25:22.604 --> 25:24.689
He's got the Midas touch

25:24.856 --> 25:26.482
But he touched it too much

25:26.650 --> 25:31.028
Hey, Goldmember

25:31.196 --> 25:33.030
He's got a golden pad

25:33.448 --> 25:35.116
He's super bad

25:35.284 --> 25:39.704
Hey, Goldmember

25:39.871 --> 25:44.041
Good evening, everybody,
and welcome to Studio 69.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.043
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.588
It's Goldmember!

25:58.223 --> 26:01.100
Hey, everybody, I am from Holland.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.853
Isn't that weird? Yes. Ha, ha.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.481
He's got the Midas touch

26:07.649 --> 26:09.525
But he touched it too much

26:09.693 --> 26:11.736
Hey, Goldmember
Yoah

26:11.903 --> 26:13.904
Hey, Goldmember

26:14.072 --> 26:15.740
You're gettin' down tonight

26:15.907 --> 26:17.908
- Ow!
You're dynamite

26:18.076 --> 26:19.410
Hey, Goldmember

26:19.578 --> 26:22.496
- Goldmember
- Hey, Goldmember

26:22.664 --> 26:24.749
'Cause that's the way, uh-huh
Uh-huh

26:24.958 --> 26:26.917
He likes it, uh-huh
Uh-huh

26:27.085 --> 26:29.086
Goldmember
Goldmember

26:29.254 --> 26:31.339
He loves it
He loves it

26:31.506 --> 26:33.507
'Cause that's the way, uh-huh
- Uh-huh

26:33.675 --> 26:35.426
- He likes it, uh-huh
- Uh-huh

26:35.594 --> 26:37.636
- Goldmember
Goldmember

26:37.804 --> 26:39.638
He loves it
He loves it

26:39.806 --> 26:41.849
He's got the Midas touch

26:42.017 --> 26:44.101
He touched it too much

26:44.269 --> 26:45.936
Hey, Goldmember

26:46.104 --> 26:48.105
Hey, Goldmember
- Goldmember

26:48.273 --> 26:50.941
He's from the Netherlands

26:51.109 --> 26:53.277
- It's where he learned to dance
- Hey, Goldmember

26:53.487 --> 26:55.321
- Gold, Goldmember
- Hey, Goldmember

26:55.489 --> 26:57.448
Hey, Goldmember

26:57.616 --> 27:00.326
It's gold, it's gold
It's gold, it's gold

27:00.535 --> 27:03.537
It's solid gold, baby

27:03.955 --> 27:06.957
- Goldmember's so solid
It's gold, it's gold, it's gold

27:07.125 --> 27:09.043
It's gold, it's gold, it's gold

27:09.211 --> 27:12.463
- It's gold
- It's solid gold, baby

27:12.631 --> 27:14.965
His member's so gold

27:15.133 --> 27:17.635
Yes, it is, yeah

27:25.143 --> 27:27.937
Well, if it isn't Austin Powers.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.146
I'm sorry?

27:29.314 --> 27:32.566
You got a lot of nerve
dragging your jive white ass in here.

27:32.734 --> 27:35.152
I don't believe we've met.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.780
It's me. Foxxy!

27:37.948 --> 27:39.281
Foxxy Cleopatra!

27:39.699 --> 27:41.325
Long time, no see.

27:41.793 --> 27:43.828
Stop!

27:43.995 --> 27:46.163
We can't be seen talking to each other,
you dig?

27:46.331 --> 27:48.749
I'm using this cat as a distraction.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.501
I get it. Yes, very clever.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.837
First things first.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.840
Ow! Ouch-kabibble!

27:56.007 --> 27:59.844
Eight years and no phone call?
Nobody stands up Foxxy Cleopatra!

28:00.011 --> 28:01.345
Where have you been?

28:01.513 --> 28:03.556
Listen, Foxxy.

28:03.723 --> 28:06.934
I just want you to know
I never intended to hurt you, baby.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.854
Well, all I know is...

28:10.021 --> 28:12.565
...Mama only got a taste of honey...

28:12.732 --> 28:15.443
...but she wanted the whole beehive.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.696
Oh, beehive.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.031
Yes, "beehive."

28:21.199 --> 28:23.451
You always knew how to make me smile.

28:23.618 --> 28:26.537
Well, you know, it's a gift, really. I, um...

28:26.705 --> 28:28.038
Ugh, what am I doing?

28:28.206 --> 28:31.208
Foxxy, what are you doing
in Goldmember's club?

28:32.210 --> 28:33.377
I'm undercover.

28:33.545 --> 28:37.214
About a year ago,
my partner at the bureau was killed.

28:37.424 --> 28:40.885
And that jive-ass turkey Goldmember
is the prime suspect.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.681
Your father's in the back room,
under heavy guard.

28:45.849 --> 28:48.684
- Thanks, Foxxy.
- Austin! Good luck.

29:05.202 --> 29:06.410
Oh!

29:06.578 --> 29:08.412
- Dad!
- Hello, son.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.207
Just overpowering my guards. Heh, heh.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.751
I'm here to rescue you. Come quickly.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.629
I've got a better idea.
Why don't you rescue me in about...

29:16.796 --> 29:19.089
...what, seven or eight minutes, eh?
Ha, ha.

29:19.257 --> 29:22.927
Oh, knock it off.
I don't want to see my dad on the job.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.094
Come on, let's go.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.931
- Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, girls.
No.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.600
I've got to go, it's my boy. Hold on.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.146
- What's wrong with your neck?
- I took a Viagra.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.690
It got stuck in my throat.
I've had a stiff neck for hours.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.108
I thank you.

29:39.653 --> 29:42.154
Listen, Dad, if you are gonna
talk about naughty things...

29:42.322 --> 29:43.989
...in front of these American girls...

29:44.157 --> 29:46.242
...then at least speak "English" English.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.827
All right, my son.

29:48.995 --> 29:51.622
I could've had it away
with this cracking Judy, my old china.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.624
Are you telling pork pies
and a bag of tripe?

29:53.792 --> 29:56.460
Because if you are feeling quiggly,
why not just have a J. Arthur?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.712
- What, Billy No-Mates?
- Too right, youth.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.423
Don't you remember the din-din
with the grotty Scottish bint?

30:01.591 --> 30:03.592
Oh, the one that was all
sixes and sevens?

30:03.760 --> 30:07.221
The trouble and strife of the Morris dancer
that lived up the apples and pears.

30:07.389 --> 30:10.015
Yes, yes, she was the barrister
that became a bobby in a lorry...

30:11.685 --> 30:14.061
...with a Gatling gun
in and above St. Regis...

30:14.229 --> 30:15.354
...tea kettle.

30:15.522 --> 30:16.730
Yes.
Then she...

30:16.898 --> 30:19.149
Shat on a turtle.

30:19.317 --> 30:23.153
- Oh, God, we had some good times, eh?
- We had some good times, eh?

30:23.321 --> 30:25.781
- Wonderful times, we had.
- Good times, yeah.

30:25.949 --> 30:29.243
We had some good, uh...

30:30.579 --> 30:31.620
...times.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.998
Welcome to 1975...

30:34.165 --> 30:36.584
...Austin Powers and father.

30:36.751 --> 30:40.504
Excuse me while I change.
The roller boogie has made me sweaty.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.172
Yeah, sweaty.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.966
You see, Mr. Powers...

30:47.345 --> 30:50.723
...I love gold.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.850
The look of it, the taste of it...

30:53.018 --> 30:55.769
...the smell of it, the texture.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.646
I love gold so much...

30:57.814 --> 31:02.109
...that I even lost my genitalia
in an unfortunate smelting accident.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.695
Hence the name...

31:04.863 --> 31:06.780
...Goldmember.

31:14.748 --> 31:17.708
We are both swingers, you see? Ha, ha.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.377
You have a tight body. Yes.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.379
I see that from your tight pants.

31:23.006 --> 31:26.175
Yes, you are tight like a tiger.

31:26.343 --> 31:28.510
Would you like a smoke and a pancake?

31:28.678 --> 31:31.555
- A what?
- A smoke and a pancake.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.892
You know, flapjack and a cigarette?

31:35.060 --> 31:37.061
All right. Cigar and a waffle?

31:37.270 --> 31:39.396
No? Pipe and a crepe?

31:39.564 --> 31:42.232
- No? Bong and a blintz?
No.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.361
Ah, well. Then there is no pleasing you.

31:45.528 --> 31:47.237
That's not right.

31:47.405 --> 31:50.282
Ooh, hello. What have we here?

31:50.492 --> 31:51.950
That's a keeper. Yes.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.745
Put it in the skin box, please.
With the others.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.248
- I'm peeling.
- Oh, that's just disgusting.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.084
Quickly. Quickly. Thank you.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.418
Save me from myself.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.712
You're insane, Goldmember.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.925
And that's the way,
uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.427
KC and the Sunshine Band.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.889
All right, Goldmember,
don't play the laughing boy.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.101
There are only two things
I can't stand in this world:

32:17.268 --> 32:21.480
People who are intolerant
of other people's cultures...

32:21.648 --> 32:23.774
...and the Dutch.
What?

32:27.445 --> 32:29.113
Take the father away.

32:31.199 --> 32:35.703
Dutch-hater. And now, ha, ha,
it is time to say goodbye.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.955
Dr. Evil's orders.

32:38.123 --> 32:41.458
Which for you is bad news, bears.

32:41.626 --> 32:42.710
Walter Matthau.

32:42.877 --> 32:44.128
Shazam.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.839
Up yours, jive turkey.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.799
Traitor.

32:49.267 --> 32:51.260
Yes, the gun.
Good, very good.

32:51.428 --> 32:52.970
2002.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.640
They're taking my father
to the time machine.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.685
- The say-what machine?
Come on, now. Ha, ha.

32:59.853 --> 33:01.395
No!
- This way, sugar.

33:11.865 --> 33:13.866
That was close, Foxxy. I owe you one.

33:14.033 --> 33:18.120
Austin, I found this in Goldmember's office.
It's a microfilm. It may be a clue.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.956
- Smashing.
- I want to go to the future with you.

33:21.124 --> 33:24.168
We can catch Goldmember together.
I owe it to my partner.

33:24.335 --> 33:27.296
I should warn you, Foxxy,
2002 is very different.

33:27.464 --> 33:30.340
Well, heh, the future
better get ready for me.

33:30.508 --> 33:34.762
Because I'm Foxxy Cleopatra
and I'm a whole lot of woman.

33:37.348 --> 33:40.517
2002, here we come.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.944
All visitations limited to five minutes.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.363
No spitting in the visitors' room.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.869
Herr Doctor...

33:59.037 --> 34:00.704
...I have some news.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.498
It's your son.

34:02.665 --> 34:04.541
He wants to take over
the family business.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.044
Scotty does?

34:07.212 --> 34:10.255
Oh, he's gotten so evil,
he has even started losing his hair.

34:10.422 --> 34:11.840
I know, it's sweet.

34:12.007 --> 34:15.052
Oh, he just wants to make you proud,
Herr Doctor.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.596
After all, it's hard on the boy
not having a father.

34:17.764 --> 34:21.891
You know, first you were frozen,
then you were in space, now you're in jail.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.686
Well, don't tell me he feels neglected.

34:24.853 --> 34:27.688
I was adopted by fricking Belgians, eh?

34:27.857 --> 34:29.233
You were adopted?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.944
I never met my birth parents.

34:32.110 --> 34:34.404
There was a car accident.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.491
I'm told it was a beautiful Belgian day.

34:37.659 --> 34:41.661
The smell of waffles and Brussels sprouts
filled the summer air...

34:41.830 --> 34:43.496
...until...

34:44.623 --> 34:46.750
My birth mother was incinerated.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.962
I only survived
because her smoking carcass...

34:50.129 --> 34:53.757
...formed a protective cocoon
of slaughtered human effluence.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.010
A Belgian man and his 15-year-old
love slave with webbed feet...

34:57.178 --> 34:58.679
...was looting the accident scene.

34:58.847 --> 35:01.056
They came across a blood-soaked baby,
moi.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.267
They raised me to be evil.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.228
You know, that old chestnut.

35:07.605 --> 35:10.607
But nothing compares to this,
being inside the belly of the beast...

35:10.775 --> 35:12.901
...night after night, all alone.

35:13.069 --> 35:15.279
Daddy's all pent up. Let's freak!

35:15.446 --> 35:16.780
Oh!

35:33.464 --> 35:34.506
Time's up.

35:34.674 --> 35:37.593
Visiting hours are over. Step to the line.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.386
Cuffs up.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.768
Move it.

35:51.482 --> 35:52.900
Hi, there.

35:53.067 --> 35:54.943
How you sleeping? Good?

35:57.322 --> 36:00.157
Gentlemen, listen up, y'all.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.326
Here's the new plan:

36:02.493 --> 36:04.369
You're gonna start a riot...

36:04.537 --> 36:07.664
...and we're gonna
walk out the front door.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.752
Hey, man.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.963
I know guys on crack
that makes more sense than you.

36:15.632 --> 36:16.673
Really?

36:16.841 --> 36:19.927
Then let me put it to you this way, cuz.

36:25.516 --> 36:26.850
Yeah.

36:27.518 --> 36:30.103
- Instead of treated
- We get tricked

36:30.688 --> 36:33.440
- Instead of kisses
- We get kicked

36:33.608 --> 36:34.691
It's the hard knock

36:34.859 --> 36:36.944
I don't know how to be
No crib on MTV

36:37.111 --> 36:39.196
God only knows
Got my Mini Me in the G.P.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.406
See how it goes
Evil's all that I see

36:41.574 --> 36:43.700
And you ask me my name?
D to the rizzo

36:43.868 --> 36:45.535
E to the vizzo
I to the lizzo

36:45.703 --> 36:47.913
I'm a crazy
Y'all knew that

36:48.122 --> 36:51.208
Austin caught me in the first act
It's all backwards, what's with that?

36:51.376 --> 36:54.044
So I'll make a prophecy
From the dogs to the Mini Me

36:54.212 --> 36:56.880
Give me an Escalade, a two-way
Bling bling on eBay

36:57.048 --> 36:58.799
Domino

37:02.720 --> 37:04.888
Stick that in your pipe and smoke it

37:05.056 --> 37:06.723
Instead of treated

37:07.600 --> 37:09.977
This is for all my homeys in Bruges

37:13.064 --> 37:14.731
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

37:17.694 --> 37:19.569
Ah, Cristal.

37:19.737 --> 37:20.779
My Moto.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.406
A couple of beyotches.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.074
Why not?

37:24.659 --> 37:26.785
I gotta bust a move
Drop and bust a groove

37:26.953 --> 37:29.204
Feelin' fine, got an evil crew
Goldmember too

37:29.372 --> 37:30.372
Lick my 9

37:30.540 --> 37:33.083
Till then I'll... on my... butt
Brains out

37:33.251 --> 37:35.919
Put... on call
And splooge in your... that's all

37:36.087 --> 37:37.838
Fo' shizzle my nizzle, y'all

37:41.134 --> 37:42.467
Yeah.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.553
All right, listen up.

37:44.721 --> 37:47.347
Tonight, 8 p.m.,
you're going to start a riot.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.766
Yes, Dr. Evil.

37:49.934 --> 37:53.437
Attention, all guards.
There is a riot in progress.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.439
Seal all exits.

37:55.606 --> 38:00.485
Attention. Dr. Evil and his clone
are trying to escape.

38:00.653 --> 38:04.531
All guards report to Cell Block A
immediately.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.784
Dr. Evil and his clone are getting away.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.128
There you are.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.131
- Good morning, sunshine.
- Good morning.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.591
How did you sleep?

38:22.759 --> 38:26.136
- Great.
- Me too. If these lips could talk.

38:27.764 --> 38:29.973
Mm. Oh, hello.

38:31.184 --> 38:33.226
You have the right to remain sexy, sugar.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.687
Oh. I hope there's a search involved.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.399
You've got mail.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.985
So, what does this thing do?

38:42.153 --> 38:43.653
Well, it's called the Internet...

38:43.821 --> 38:46.198
...and it's completely revolutionized
the way we live...

38:46.365 --> 38:47.991
...and access vital information.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.118
For example, have a look at this:

38:50.286 --> 38:51.620
Oh, look at the monkey.

38:51.788 --> 38:54.831
Oh, he's got his finger on his...
Oh, no. Wetch out.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.920
Wow. Now, that's vital information.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.588
I know. It's amazing.

39:04.342 --> 39:07.177
Oh, Basil. What's happening, baby?

39:07.345 --> 39:09.012
A lot is happening, Foxxy.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.264
Dr. Evil has escaped.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.475
The good news is that
one of our agents...

39:13.643 --> 39:17.020
...has managed to infiltrate
Dr. Evil's organization.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.857
Excellent. We've been trying for years
to get a mole inside Dr. Evil's lair.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.984
- We now have that mole.
- Yes.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.446
And here he is.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.491
So you're the...

39:30.284 --> 39:34.037
Mo...

39:34.205 --> 39:36.081
Most. Most.

39:36.249 --> 39:38.625
- Most.
- Most excellent agent we've ever seen.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.044
Yes, most excellent agent we've ever seen.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.046
Thank you.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.714
Thank you.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.551
Now, I wasn't able to get an exact location,
but I did learn...

39:47.718 --> 39:50.512
...that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair
outside of Tokio, Japan.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.726
By the way, I realize
that I have a large mole on my face.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.646
Where? Ha, ha.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.482
What? Where's that mole? Heh, heh.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.734
I didn't see one.

40:05.570 --> 40:09.197
I also realize the irony
that I am myself a mole.

40:10.074 --> 40:12.993
No one would make that connection.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.914
Anyway, well done, old chap.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.124
Jolly good work.

40:19.292 --> 40:22.586
Yes, nice to mole you... Meet you.
Nice to meet your mole.

40:22.753 --> 40:23.920
- Don't say "mole."
- Stop.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.131
- I said "mole."
- Stop.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.550
Stop.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.261
- Bye.
Mole.

40:35.474 --> 40:36.766
Mole.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.643
Stop.

40:40.646 --> 40:43.356
- Mole.
- Oh, shut up!

40:45.610 --> 40:48.945
Moley-moley-moley-moley-moley.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.045
Up, periscope.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.968
Ladies and gentlemen...

41:12.136 --> 41:14.304
...welcome to my new submarine lair.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.392
It's long and hard and full of seamen.

41:24.273 --> 41:26.316
Nothing? No?

41:26.484 --> 41:27.734
Not even a titter?

41:27.902 --> 41:29.110
Tough sub.

41:29.278 --> 41:32.072
Dr. Evil, you look very tight.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.740
Yes, tight like a tiger.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.325
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Really?

41:35.493 --> 41:37.285
Yes, you look like a macho man.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.287
Village People.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.664
You know, Goldmember...

41:40.831 --> 41:43.917
...I don't think that's something
one dude should say to another dude.

41:44.085 --> 41:46.628
Yeah. A little creepy.

41:46.796 --> 41:51.591
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.
This is a keeper. Oi.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.009
Yes.

41:53.177 --> 41:57.138
All right, you're not gonna put that skin
in your mouth, are you?

41:58.641 --> 42:01.142
You did. Okay, that's just gross.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.604
Yes, salty. Yes, that was good.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.856
Ladies and gentlemen...

42:08.401 --> 42:10.068
...as you know...

42:10.236 --> 42:12.988
...we've been designing
a "tractor beam"...

42:13.155 --> 42:15.282
...code-named Preparation H.

42:16.249 --> 42:19.202
It's powerful enough to pull the meteor...

42:19.370 --> 42:23.206
..."Midas 22" into a collision course
with the Earth.

42:23.374 --> 42:27.752
Upon entering the atmosphere,
the hot ball of magma...

42:27.920 --> 42:31.756
...will strike and melt the polar icecaps,
causing a global flood.

42:31.924 --> 42:36.386
But enough of my technical mumbo jumbo.
Allow me to demonstrate.

42:40.891 --> 42:42.058
Lower the globe.

42:42.226 --> 42:44.060
Lower the globe!

42:49.066 --> 42:51.151
Well, congratulations, numbnuts.

42:51.319 --> 42:55.363
You've succeeded in turning me
into a fricking jack-in-the-box.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.991
Get it off. Get it off. It's dark, it's dark.

42:58.159 --> 42:59.868
I'm okay. I'm okay.

43:01.454 --> 43:03.079
Release the meteor.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.248
Release the meteor!

43:10.421 --> 43:11.504
No way.

43:11.672 --> 43:13.173
Right in the kniggin.

43:13.341 --> 43:16.384
Goddamn it.

43:16.552 --> 43:18.094
Guys.

43:18.596 --> 43:19.929
Way to go, A-hole.

43:20.097 --> 43:24.434
All right, hold on while I try
and find my balls, for God's sakes.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.811
One, two and three.

43:26.979 --> 43:28.772
Okay. I'm okay.

43:28.939 --> 43:32.859
Dr. Evil, we still have
the ultimate insurance policy.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.444
May I present to you...

43:34.612 --> 43:37.822
...the very sexual, the very tight...

43:38.032 --> 43:41.117
...Austin Powers' father.

43:41.285 --> 43:43.953
- His what?
- His father, Dr. Evil.

43:44.121 --> 43:45.872
His "farger"?

43:46.540 --> 43:50.251
- What's a farger?
- His father. You know, the father.

43:50.419 --> 43:55.090
Yeah. Goldmember, I don't speak
freaky-deaky Dutch, okay, perv boy?

43:55.257 --> 43:57.384
Father. His dad. Dad is father.

43:57.551 --> 43:58.676
Oh, his dad?

43:58.844 --> 44:01.137
Oh, his father.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.807
Yes, I have a Dutch accent.
Isn't that weird?

44:03.974 --> 44:05.892
Father. Father.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.145
Ah, Nigel Powers.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.647
Hello, hello.

44:14.276 --> 44:18.613
- Bring him to me.
- Easy peezy, lemon squeezy.

44:18.781 --> 44:21.866
Oh, put the guns down.
Is this the first day on the job or something?

44:22.034 --> 44:25.662
Look, this is how it goes.
You attack me one at a time...

44:25.830 --> 44:29.082
...and I knock you out with a single punch.
Okay? Go.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.667
- Judo chop.
- Oh, he's good.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.085
Judo chop.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.129
Do you know who I am?

44:34.547 --> 44:36.881
Have you any idea
how many anonymous henchmen...

44:37.049 --> 44:39.509
...I've killed over the years?
And look at you.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.679
You haven't even got a nametag.
You got no chance.

44:42.847 --> 44:44.305
Why don't you just fall down?

44:44.473 --> 44:46.391
Go on, son.

44:48.269 --> 44:51.771
All right, Dr. Evil, give yourself up
while you've still got a chance.

44:53.524 --> 44:56.484
Okay. Okay. You've got me.

44:56.652 --> 44:59.028
Nigel Powers, meet...

44:59.947 --> 45:01.698
...Mini Me.
Oh, blimey.

45:01.866 --> 45:03.199
I thought I smelled cabbage.

45:04.368 --> 45:05.535
Take him away.

45:05.703 --> 45:09.706
Uh, Dr. Evil, can I paint his yoo-hoo gold?

45:09.874 --> 45:12.542
It's kind of my thing, you know.

45:18.215 --> 45:21.634
How about no, you crazy Dutch bastard?

45:23.929 --> 45:26.097
Attention, henchmen, it's health week.

45:26.265 --> 45:28.892
Don't forget your physical.
Dr. EVil's orders.

45:32.980 --> 45:35.982
You know, I think it's a shame
the way they treat you.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.735
Just because
you're one-eighth their size...

45:38.903 --> 45:41.905
...doesn't mean you deserve
one-eighth of their respect.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.199
Does it?

45:44.366 --> 45:47.076
Say, mini-fella, I'm, uh...

45:47.244 --> 45:49.078
...I'm curious.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.916
Is, uh, everything in proportion?

45:54.418 --> 45:57.086
You know, your bobby-dangler,
your general, two colonels...

45:57.254 --> 45:59.506
...your giggle stick, master of ceremonies.

46:00.841 --> 46:03.092
Yeah. Oh, don't be shy. Let's have a look.

46:08.724 --> 46:10.433
My word.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.101
You're a tripod.

46:13.854 --> 46:17.732
What do you feed that thing, eh?
It's like a baby's arm holding an apple.

46:19.401 --> 46:23.613
The good news is, you ever get tired,
you can use it as a kickstand.

46:28.869 --> 46:32.705
I think we both know who the real brains is
behind this operation, eh?

46:47.972 --> 46:50.932
Tokio à gogo, baby. Yeah.

46:52.768 --> 46:54.394
Oh, what's kicking, Basil?

46:54.562 --> 46:57.313
A lot's kicking, Foxxy. Austin...

46:57.481 --> 47:01.734
...one of Dr. Evil's henchmen
has been spotted at the Asahi Sumo Arena.

47:01.902 --> 47:03.820
Proceed there immediately.

47:03.988 --> 47:05.321
Thanks, Basil.

47:11.537 --> 47:16.291
Ah, Jesus Christ.
This diaper's making my nuts rub together.

47:16.458 --> 47:19.335
It's gonna start a fire.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.254
That's Fat Bastard.

47:21.422 --> 47:25.174
...Fat Bastard.

47:37.688 --> 47:40.023
You know what my favorite
Helen Hunt movie is?

47:40.190 --> 47:41.190
Twister.

47:47.489 --> 47:48.865
Oh!

47:49.033 --> 47:51.534
Fat Bastard...

47:53.203 --> 47:55.496
- That's not right.
- Sure ain't.

47:55.664 --> 47:57.498
Are we done here?

47:57.666 --> 47:59.834
I've got to take a crap.

48:01.545 --> 48:02.920
Wait a tick.

48:03.088 --> 48:05.173
Something doesn't smell right.

48:05.341 --> 48:07.884
And I think it's Fat Bastard.

48:08.052 --> 48:12.472
On top of spaghetti

48:12.640 --> 48:16.225
All covered in... Ahh!...cheese

48:17.394 --> 48:21.648
I lost my poor meatball

48:21.815 --> 48:23.149
'Cause somebody...

48:25.611 --> 48:30.198
- You okay, Austin?
- Sound as a pound, love. Yeah. Good.

48:30.908 --> 48:34.327
What the...? I didn't have any corn.

48:49.176 --> 48:50.593
Hey, diaper lady.

48:51.345 --> 48:52.887
Here's my diaper.

48:54.556 --> 48:56.683
I think I might have pinched one off
too soon.

48:59.186 --> 49:02.522
Oh, I left a rosebud in there for you.

49:11.865 --> 49:14.617
You really are a fat bastard.

49:14.785 --> 49:18.121
You know, that hurts my feelings.
I tried going on a diet, you know.

49:18.288 --> 49:21.791
The Zone. You know,
"carbs are the enemy"?

49:22.376 --> 49:24.460
We don't like carbs,
you know what I mean?

49:27.673 --> 49:29.048
Who's your friend?

49:30.300 --> 49:32.802
Oh, I'd like to have a go with that filly.

49:32.970 --> 49:35.513
Oh, do you find me sexy?

49:35.681 --> 49:37.557
Oh, look at my titties.

49:39.143 --> 49:42.478
- Shut your mouth.
- Mm, yeah.

49:43.063 --> 49:44.564
All right, that's enough.

49:44.732 --> 49:46.733
Okay, you got me.

49:46.900 --> 49:48.317
- Put it there, would you?
- Okay.

49:53.907 --> 49:55.241
Come here, you.

49:56.034 --> 49:58.494
Ow, my titties!

49:58.662 --> 50:00.830
Ow, you gave me a nurple.

50:06.462 --> 50:08.504
I've got you now.

50:09.673 --> 50:10.840
Come here, you.

50:17.347 --> 50:20.850
Prepare for the ultimate
wire-fighting maneuver.

50:22.269 --> 50:25.438
I just hope my wire-fighting team
is ready.

50:28.317 --> 50:30.193
Whoa!

50:45.459 --> 50:47.627
- Crikey.
- Oh, great.

50:47.795 --> 50:49.629
Isn't this magical?

50:49.797 --> 50:51.506
One of my wires broke.

50:59.181 --> 51:00.681
You under arrest, sugar.

51:03.185 --> 51:06.229
Okay, Fat Bastard, who's the Japanese cat
you made an exchange with?

51:06.396 --> 51:08.564
Oh, all right.

51:08.982 --> 51:11.192
His name is Roboto.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.486
He owns Roboto Industries.

51:13.654 --> 51:18.324
He's designing some contraption
for Dr. Evil. I don't know.

51:18.492 --> 51:20.076
The tractor beam.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.494
- That's it.
Listen...

51:21.662 --> 51:24.664
...do you honestly think
that crime can pay?

51:24.832 --> 51:27.750
Well, to be honest with you,
I've been trying to go legit.

51:28.418 --> 51:31.546
I really take my sumo wrestling
seriously, you know.

51:32.923 --> 51:35.967
But when you're an overweight child...

51:36.134 --> 51:39.804
...in a society that demands perfection...

51:40.639 --> 51:43.099
...well, your sense of right, wrong...

51:43.267 --> 51:45.810
...fair and unfair...

51:47.104 --> 51:50.606
...will always be tragically skewed.

51:55.612 --> 51:57.947
Did you just soil yourself?

51:58.115 --> 52:00.575
Maybe.

52:00.742 --> 52:03.452
It did sound a little wet, didn't it?
Right at the end.

52:05.038 --> 52:06.414
Let's have a smell, all right?

52:07.791 --> 52:09.125
Ooh, wafting, wafting.

52:09.293 --> 52:12.879
Oh, everyone likes their own brand,
don't they? This is magic.

52:13.046 --> 52:14.755
All right, analysis:

52:14.923 --> 52:17.967
Oh, it smells like carrots and throw-up.

52:18.135 --> 52:20.136
Oh, that could gag a maggot.

52:20.304 --> 52:24.807
I smell like hot, sick ass
in a dead carcass.

52:25.517 --> 52:29.103
Oh, even stink would say that stinks.

52:29.271 --> 52:31.480
You know when you go
into an apartment building...

52:31.648 --> 52:34.317
...and you smell other people's cooking
on each floor and you go:

52:34.484 --> 52:37.737
"What are they cooking?" That, plus crap.

52:45.537 --> 52:47.413
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey, Scotty.

52:47.581 --> 52:49.165
How you been, sport?

52:49.333 --> 52:50.833
Whoa!

52:51.001 --> 52:52.293
I got you a present.

52:52.461 --> 52:53.794
Really?

52:53.962 --> 52:56.339
- Open the tank.
- Open the tank!

53:02.971 --> 53:06.682
Are those sharks with laser beams
attached to their heads?

53:11.271 --> 53:13.898
Cool. You mean I actually have
fricking sharks...

53:14.066 --> 53:17.526
...with fricking laser beams
attached to their fricking heads?

53:18.153 --> 53:21.322
You're the best evil son
an evil dad could ever ask for.

53:23.742 --> 53:24.784
Well, I love you, Dad.

53:28.372 --> 53:29.622
I love you, son.

53:31.375 --> 53:32.583
It's touching moment, yes.

53:32.751 --> 53:35.169
Scotty, come here.

53:36.129 --> 53:38.297
Pop a squat right next to Daddy.

53:40.884 --> 53:42.093
Mini Me?

53:42.636 --> 53:44.637
Move down the bench.

53:46.139 --> 53:47.556
Move down the bench.

53:47.724 --> 53:49.141
There's a power struggle, yes.

53:54.564 --> 53:56.899
Scotty's on fire.

53:58.735 --> 54:00.528
All right, it's getting crowded in here.

54:00.696 --> 54:02.905
Everyone out, everyone out. Come on.

54:03.073 --> 54:05.199
Not you, Scotty. Not you, Number Two.

54:05.367 --> 54:07.034
Not you, Frau. Not you, Goldmember.

54:07.202 --> 54:08.536
Not you, guys back there.

54:08.704 --> 54:10.746
Not you, Henchman Holding Wrench.

54:10.914 --> 54:12.915
Not you,
Henchman Arbitrarily Turning Knobs...

54:13.083 --> 54:15.084
...Making It Seem Like
You're Doing Something.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.099
Oh, this is uncomfortable.

54:30.267 --> 54:32.935
Heh, heh. The tiny one can't take a hint.

54:34.062 --> 54:36.605
He doesn't understand.
He is small.

54:54.207 --> 54:56.417
Hello, Foxxy. Austin.

54:56.585 --> 55:00.087
We've confirmed what Fat Bastard told you
about Roboto is accurate.

55:00.255 --> 55:03.632
He was hired by Dr. Evil
to construct Preparation H.

55:03.800 --> 55:07.887
So Roboto had the technology
to build Goldmember's tractor beam.

55:08.055 --> 55:09.930
Which means Roboto
will lead us to Goldmember.

55:10.098 --> 55:13.184
Which means Goldmember
will lead us to my father.

55:25.572 --> 55:28.657
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto. I thank you.

55:34.164 --> 55:36.248
- You speak Japanese?
- A little.

55:36.416 --> 55:39.085
Well, you might be a cunning linguist,
but I'm a master debater.

55:42.839 --> 55:45.091
I'm looking for my father.
He was kidnapped.

55:50.430 --> 55:52.139
Please eat what?

55:52.557 --> 55:53.891
Wait.

55:54.810 --> 55:58.521
He said,
"Please eat some shitake mushrooms."

55:58.688 --> 56:00.481
Tell me...

56:00.649 --> 56:02.108
...what do you know...

56:02.275 --> 56:05.861
...about my father's where...

56:07.030 --> 56:10.324
...abouts?

56:15.622 --> 56:17.873
"Your ass is happy"?

56:18.041 --> 56:19.375
No.

56:21.628 --> 56:24.964
He said,
"Your assignment is an unhappy one."

56:29.302 --> 56:31.887
Nice potty mouth, dirtbag.

56:37.227 --> 56:39.979
Yes, quite off topic,
thank you very much.

56:40.814 --> 56:43.023
Why don't I just speak in English?

56:44.234 --> 56:46.235
That would be a good idea,
now, wouldn't it?

56:46.403 --> 56:48.404
That way I wouldn't
misread the subtitles...

56:48.572 --> 56:51.740
...making it seem like
you're saying things that are dirty.

56:51.908 --> 56:55.077
I'm sorry to hear about your father,
but I can't help you.

56:56.913 --> 56:59.248
Please excuse me.
I have another appointment.

57:05.255 --> 57:06.463
By the way...

57:11.845 --> 57:15.181
- Mr. Roboto is lying to us.
- Tell me something I don't know.

57:15.348 --> 57:17.600
- I open-mouth kissed a horse once.
- Say what?

57:17.767 --> 57:19.185
That's something you don't know.

57:19.352 --> 57:22.271
My spider sense is telling me
that my father's still in this building.

57:22.439 --> 57:25.774
You keep a lookout.
I'm gonna try and sneak in.

58:48.650 --> 58:49.900
Come on, come on, come on.

59:08.878 --> 59:10.045
Judo chop!

59:36.156 --> 59:38.073
Shazam!

59:38.241 --> 59:39.575
Come on, sugar.

59:44.622 --> 59:47.416
- There's Goldmember and Roboto.
Yes, very impressive.

59:47.584 --> 59:50.252
Put Preparation H
into my schtuppen transporten.

59:53.548 --> 59:56.550
- What's this?
- You need this to turn on the tractor beam.

59:56.718 --> 59:58.427
It's a gold key.

59:58.595 --> 01:00:00.012
It's gold.

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:02.306
Smarty-pants.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:04.600
- Let's spread out.
- Yeah.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.482
Hands up, Goldmember.
It's payback time.

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:14.276
Sure, you can kill me...

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:18.197
...but then what happens
to Austin Powers' father?

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:27.998
- Dad.
- Yes.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:31.460
And now he's going to have
an unfortunate smelting accident.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.469
- Hiya!
- Unh!

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:43.222
Don't worry, Dad. I'm here to rescue you.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:47.726
Ow! May I point out that last time around,
you fell into an obvious trap.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.312
Now you're trying to save me
instead of stopping Goldmember.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.315
Oh, please. I'm not gonna
let Goldmember get away.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.484
Austin, Goldmember's getting away.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:05.494
Hello, hello.
Aren't you going to introduce us, Austin?

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.955
- Foxxy, this is...
- Powers. Nigel Powers.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:12.584
- Is that Eau de Flores you're wearing?
- Yes, it is.

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:14.128
That's how a woman should smell.

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:16.505
Especially one as beautiful as you.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:20.592
My, my. Even in the face of danger,
you live up to your reputation.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:24.680
Get on with it.

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:30.853
I've got an idea.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.025
Your spy car's a MINI?

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:40.195
It's not the size, mate,
it's how you use it.

01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:05.471
I would've found my way off that.

01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:07.639
Fellas.
- What? I saved your life.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:10.350
- You should've been doing your job.
- Oh, you're welcome, man.

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:12.519
Shut up and turn around, please!

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:43.300
Run! It's Godzilla!

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:47.054
It looks like Godzilla, but due to
international copyright laws, it's not.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:49.598
Still, we should run like it is Godzilla!

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.016
Though it isn't.

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:57.940
There's Goldmember.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.448
Breaker, breaker, 1-niner?

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.450
This is Goldy-Wang. Over.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.118
10-4, there, Goldy-Wang.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.621
This is Rubber Ducky.
What's your 10-20? Over.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:16.583
I've got Preparation H in my rear
and Smokey the Bear in my back door.

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:19.044
We've got us a convoy. Over.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:22.965
Yee-haw! Copy that, you son of a bitch
pile of monkey nuts.

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:26.009
Open wide there, Rubber Ducky.

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:28.679
I am entering your mouth now. Over.

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:38.647
Oh, great. Goldmember got away.
Now what?

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.608
I think it's obvious.
We should take Dr. Evil's lair by force.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.194
- You can be my backup, son.
- Backup?

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:46.280
Well, that's fairly condescending.

01:03:46.447 --> 01:03:48.532
Do you think Dr. Evil's
gonna expect an attack?

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.534
We should infiltrate his lair.

01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:53.328
This ain't my first rodeo, cowboy.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:57.499
We need commandos, scuba,
gadgets, for God's sake.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.002
Well, I don't like to use gadgets...

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:02.296
...outside the bedroom. I thank you.

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.258
Outside the bedroom.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:09.845
You know, I think being frozen
damaged your brain.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.140
Really? And how would you know?

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:16.977
This is the most time
that we've ever spent together since...

01:04:17.478 --> 01:04:18.520
...ever.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.772
- What are you saying, son?
- Oh, please.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.859
What boy learned to drive a car
with machine guns on it?

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:27.029
Or had a helicopter
you can fit in a knapsack?

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:29.197
What about your Swedish nanny, Helga?

01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:31.700
Oh, yes. Helga.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.702
Let's say I didn't hire her for the cooking.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:35.454
Oh, yes.

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.289
She stayed on until you were 24.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.792
We were mates, you and I.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.171
I didn't need a friend, I needed a father.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:47.215
Do you know I risked my life
trying to save you...

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:49.843
...and you still don't give me any respect.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:54.306
Respect? Oh, come on.
If you've got an issue, here's a tissue.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:05.484
That is not funny.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.904
Well, I suppose we better go
our separate ways, then.

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:16.703
Fine.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:31.051
So I've been assigned to welcome you
to the Ministry of Defence.

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:34.680
I have a letter from my director
personally thanking you for switching sides.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.232
I can't wait to inform Austin
of your defection.

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:51.947
Oh, hello, Basil.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.950
Yes, Austin should be here
any second. Yes.

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:57.953
Yes, I'm in Austin's hotel room right now.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:08.630
Assassin!

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.218
Try to kill me, will you?

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:18.098
Oh, you want to be friends, huh?

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:21.393
Wait a tick.

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:24.062
Peace?

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.272
Oh!

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.274
I'm not falling for that again.

01:06:36.617 --> 01:06:38.827
But at least he didn't mention it.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.329
Yes, I realize he can't talk.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:45.500
Listen, I think Dr. Evil treated him badly
and that's why he's decided to help us.

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:53.759
Come back here, you little bugger.

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:56.011
Got you.

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:01.933
Oh, yes, I'm sure Austin and Mini
will get along famously.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:06.605
No, I guarantee nothing will happen
to Mini Me on my watch.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.695
Come on, you bugger.
Come on, I got you.

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:23.371
Oh, I think he and Austin will be united
in their commitment to stopping Dr. Evil.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:31.004
Austin, there you are.
I've come to tell you the good news.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:37.052
Mini Me has...

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:38.887
...switched sides.

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:47.020
Sorry about that, old chap. Sorry.
You know. Sorry.

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:49.648
Welcome aboard.

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:52.317
- My "mole-stake."
- What was that?

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:56.571
- Listen, just get it out of your system.
- No, I'm fine.

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.740
- We could work together better if...
- It's okay...

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.617
Mole! Bloody mole!

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:04.913
We're not supposed to talk about the mole,
but there's a mole winking me in the face.

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:09.334
I'm gonna chop it off and cut it up
and make some guacamole.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.839
- Better?
- Yeah. Yes.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.189
So you've decided to join us,
huh, Mini Me?

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.608
Welcome to the good side,
my mini-brother.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.778
And thank you for the map
of Dr. Evil's sub.

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:39.948
What's this? It says:

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:43.577
"Dr. Evil's tractor beam is now complete.
There's not much time.

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:45.287
Dr. Evil must pay."

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:53.086
"You are so beautiful.
Are you a clone of an ángel?"

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:58.591
That is so sweet.
Well, no, my mini-man, I'm not.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:04.139
"Are you sure you don't have
a little clone in you?"

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.892
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.350
"Would you like to?"

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.899
Horny bugger.

01:09:14.066 --> 01:09:16.109
That is so not funny.

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:18.904
Okay, everyone, prepare to dive.

01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:21.573
This spy car's also a submarine.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.341
Get me the World Organization.

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:43.011
What is it, Dr. Evil?

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.638
Gentlemen, in a matter of hours...

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:48.683
...a meteor will crash into Earth,
causing a global flood.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.977
That is, of course, unless you pay me...

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.147
...one billion...

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.322
...million yen.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:04.199
I think you're bluffing.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:08.370
Well, perhaps you'd like a demonstration.
Number Two, the key, please.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.394
Sir, Dr. Evil's not bluffing.

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.562
One of our satellites is falling out of orbit.

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.148
- Which one?
- It's the one that looks like a pair of...

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:40.568
Melons. Big, juicy melons.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.737
Are they nice and firm?

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.739
Well, what do you think?

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.659
Look at that. It looks like a set of giant...

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:53.415
- Hey, "A" and "N", you're late.
- How we doing? We're back.

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:55.917
Go, Titans!

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.503
Check it out. Those remind me of...

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:01.006
- Boobs.
- Boobs, Ozzy?

01:11:01.173 --> 01:11:05.593
- These filmmakers are ****ing boobs.
- What do you mean, Dad?

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:10.348
They're using the same ****ing joke
as they did in the last Austin Powers movie.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:12.934
- What ****ing joke?
- You know, the ****ing joke...

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.603
...about the long smooth rocket
that looks like some guy's...

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:17.605
- Johnson.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:21.443
- Any sign of that satellite?
- No, sir. It's gone.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:25.155
Gentlemen, you have my demands.
Peace out.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.442
Cor, baby. You look very switched on.

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.528
Thank you, Austin.

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:11.951
No, Mini Me. Off. Bad. Mustn't.
No humping.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:17.248
Dr. Evil, in light of the success
of the device...

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:19.834
...it is Japanese custom
that I receive a bonus.

01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:24.005
A bonus? That's good.

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.840
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.510
Throw me a fricking bonus here.

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.349
Oh, I haven't laughed that hard
since I was a little girl. Thank you.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:38.186
You're not joking.

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.522
No. In fact,
if you don't give me the bonus...

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:42.816
Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Scotty. How are you, sport?

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:53.284
- Why don't you let me take care of this?
- Okay.

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.173
He's got a good evil laugh.

01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:10.009
Get along.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:11.344
Scotty!

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:16.349
Scotty.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:19.310
Take it down a notch.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:21.729
It's creeping a bit.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:23.815
Let's go.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.529
We'll need a disguise.

01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:32.574
There's only one uniform.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:36.744
One of us has to go on
the other one's shoulders.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:52.302
Hey there, buddy. How's it going?
Good to see you.

01:13:52.469 --> 01:13:55.430
Yeah. Yeah. Hi.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:59.434
How are you? Just getting my sea legs.
Sorry about that.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:00.935
Hello. You all right?

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.147
Yes, it's a good hat. Very good hat.

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:07.442
Come on, Mini Me. Let's go.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.737
Hold it right there, mister.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.451
Did you really think
you could get away with this?

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:18.786
I did, actually. Yes.

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:21.039
Every new recruit must have a physical.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:23.750
Now get in here, sailor.

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:27.003
I'm going to need a urine sample.

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:29.964
Okay.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.887
- No.
- I don't know.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:40.141
Okay, then. Um...

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.356
Okay.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:56.741
Hello.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:05.959
And here we go.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.794
Sorry.

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:10.421
Right. There you go. Right.

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:13.258
Ah, yes.
- Terrific.

01:15:13.425 --> 01:15:15.510
Yes, good. Okay.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:19.430
All right, sailor, go behind that screen...

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.474
...and strip down to your skivvies.

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:24.852
All right, then. I'll just go to that screen...

01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:28.564
...which is over there.

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:33.945
Right behind that screen.

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:36.614
Next.

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:40.535
Come on, hurry. The map.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.204
Okay, what's our plan?

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.959
- I'm going to need a urine sample.
- Okay.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:49.711
Which way to the main chamber?

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:11.316
Okay, so... Oh, sure.

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:26.664
- Excuse me, doctor?
- It's difficult in public, isn't it?

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:37.425
Mini Me, our shadows.
We're casting a shadow.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.344
What's wrong, sailor?

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:41.721
You should check that guy out.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.187
What the hell's going on here?

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:54.025
Hands up.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.946
You heard me. I said, hands up.
Both of you.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:14.796
- Come with me.
- Mini Me, the map. Go.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.926
Okay. You got me.

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:32.480
Are you all right, little man?

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.148
Uh-huh.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:38.403
Right on.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.754
Mr. Powers.

01:17:56.922 --> 01:17:58.506
Before I kill you...

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:02.135
...perhaps you'd like to see
the genius of my plan.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:05.805
Key, please.

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:13.187
What the...? Who? But how? Where? Huh?

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:17.024
- Looking for this?
- Huh?

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:21.154
- Mini Me?
- All right...

01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:25.074
...everybody drop your guns,
because Foxxy Cleopatra's in the sub.

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:28.369
Smashing, Foxxy. Yeah.

01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:32.707
Unh!
- Here, sugar.

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:34.876
All right, Dr. Evil.

01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:37.795
It's finally come down to this.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.008
You, me and a gun.

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:46.679
What are you going to do now, Austin?

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.349
Dad?

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:53.102
What are you doing here?

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:56.230
I've gotta finish this off once and for all.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.443
I'm afraid you can't do that.

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:02.570
I have to protect my son.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.739
Dad, I'm fine.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:07.074
I'm not talking about you.

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:11.245
I'm talking about him.

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:15.666
What?

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:19.253
Dr. Evil's not your son, I am.

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:21.255
- You both are.
- Huh?!

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:24.425
What?

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:29.263
It was our first family holiday together.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:31.766
Just as I was finishing a case...

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:35.102
...your mother brought the two of you
to Belgium.

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:41.609
I stopped to have a tinkle when the car...

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:56.374
But my parents died in a car accident.

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:58.626
It was no accident.

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.420
It was an assassination attempt.

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:04.006
I thought only Austin survived.

01:20:04.174 --> 01:20:06.467
I should have told you the truth earlier...

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:09.470
...but those Belgians,
they made you so damn...

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:10.930
...evil.

01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:15.393
And, of course, they share a border
with the Dutch.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:20.314
Very interesting story, Mr. Powers.

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:23.776
Of course, I'm gonna have to wait
until I see all the facts.

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:25.570
Daddy.

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:29.657
Shh, Daddy's here, Dougie.

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:31.826
Uh, "Dougie"?

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.911
- Dougie?
- Dougie. Remember, Dougie?

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:36.247
Dad, What's going on?

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:41.836
What are you going to do, Austin?

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.976
Austin.

01:20:57.144 --> 01:20:58.978
Are you sure you can trust Dr. Evil?

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:03.190
He ain't heavy...

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.693
...he's my brother, baby. Yeah.

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.782
I should have told you this
so long ago, son.

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:14.160
- I'm very proud of you.
- Unh!

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:19.665
- Can you forgive me?
- I forgive you, Dad.

01:21:26.506 --> 01:21:27.548
Come on.

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:31.385
Yes.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.064
My two sons.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:47.234
I'm Dougie. I'm Dougie.

01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:52.198
Come on.

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:55.409
Oh, there you are.

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.499
Oh, come on.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:05.211
I mean, first I'm not evil enough for you.

01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:07.588
And now you're gonna turn good?

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:09.215
Listen, Scott.

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:11.008
You can spend your whole life...

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:14.220
...trying to win your parents' acceptance,
believe me.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:18.766
But at the end of the day,
you've just gotta do it for yourself, baby.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:20.267
That all I've gotta do?

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:21.602
Hey, Austin? Shh!

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:23.729
What?

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:25.564
I hate you.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.776
I hate you. I hate you.

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:33.072
I don't even know you,
but I hate you too.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.907
And I especially hate you.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.161
You'll pay.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.247
You'll all pay.

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:49.505
I'd like to point out that no one else
in my gene pool runs like a girl.

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.465
Not so fast, smarty-pants.

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:54.301
Dr. Evil...

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:59.598
...you might not want to destroy the world,
but I do.

01:23:00.767 --> 01:23:03.561
Preparation H goes ahead as planned.

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:05.396
I'm going to flood the Earth.

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:07.898
Think again, Goldmember.

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:10.818
Ah, Foxxy Cleopatra.

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:15.740
It's a shame I had to kill your partner.
Too bad for you.

01:23:15.907 --> 01:23:19.827
Too bad for me?
How about too bad for you?

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:21.495
Oh, no.

01:23:28.086 --> 01:23:30.087
Luckily, I keep a spare.

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:39.263
Look, everyone.

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:41.515
My winkie was a key.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.642
Only a bloody Dutchman.

01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:45.770
You mine, sucker.

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:50.191
Yes.

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.026
Foxxy, I'm coming.

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:55.988
Nobody try anything stupid
or the shooting begins.

01:23:56.156 --> 01:24:00.034
Austin. Take Dougie.
I'll stay here and be your backup.

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:05.289
- Dougie, what do we do?
- I'm not a real "hands-on evil genius."

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:07.708
Think. You were always the smart one.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:11.962
Uh, I could reroute the output capacitor
to the tractor beam...

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:14.673
...from one of the conduit boxes up there.

01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:16.008
Come on, let's go.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:24.725
Yes. The shooting begins.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:29.563
Let me shoot.

01:24:34.986 --> 01:24:36.362
You know, Dr. Evil...

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:39.406
...I used to think you were crazy.
- I know.

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:43.118
But now I can see you're nuts.
I thank you.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:45.955
Give me the gun.

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:02.263
Hurry.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.977
Father. Father. Father.

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.938
Father, can you hear me?

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:12.231
Father. Father.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:27.454
Well done, Austin.
He saved the world again.

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:29.582
Hey, yeah.

01:25:29.749 --> 01:25:30.875
Thank you.

01:25:31.042 --> 01:25:32.334
Right on.

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:35.921
- Austin, you did it.
- We did it.

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:38.132
Yeah, baby.

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:42.803
No? Just trying it on.

01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:46.056
Goldmember?

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:48.142
You under arrest, sugar.

01:25:51.271 --> 01:25:53.439
Hey, assholes.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:58.152
Do I have time for a last smoke
and a pancake, or what?

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:06.452
I am from Holland. Isn't that weird?

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.205
Yeah.

01:26:10.373 --> 01:26:12.583
Yes, well done.

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:14.793
Good on you, man.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:19.840
Thank you.

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:36.607
Yes.

01:26:38.735 --> 01:26:40.611
Hey, Powers.

01:26:43.323 --> 01:26:47.159
Fat Bastard? But you're not fat anymore.

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:50.829
I went on the Subway diet.
You know, just like Jared.

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:53.207
I've lost 180 pounds.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:54.959
Congratulations, baby.

01:26:55.126 --> 01:26:58.796
Thank you. I do have a little bit
of excess skin, though.

01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:00.547
Bit of a problem here, yeah.

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:04.802
And unfortunately,
my neck does look like a vagina.

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:09.348
Austin! Austin!
Over here.

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:13.769
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:15.729
Austin, you the boss!
- You all right?

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:18.315
Loved it!
- Okay.

01:27:18.775 --> 01:27:19.984
Austin...

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:23.320
...thank you for everything.

01:27:31.621 --> 01:27:32.913
Shazam.

01:27:45.135 --> 01:27:48.554
I'm gonna get you, Austin Powers.

01:28:20.378 --> 01:28:22.337
Well, they're using the same
****ing joke...

01:28:22.505 --> 01:28:26.425
...as they did in the last Austin Powers
film... Movie... What was it?

01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:28.260
Well, they're using the... Well...

01:28:28.428 --> 01:28:31.722
Well, they're using the same joke
that they did...

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:34.850
What do I mean?

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:37.644
- Boobs, Ozzy.
- Stop, do that again.

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.229
You're starting to laugh.

01:28:40.607 --> 01:28:44.151
Oh, don't start, Kelly,
or I'll put you back in the refrigerator.

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:46.987
One more.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.864
- I don't like that.
- A little serious.

01:28:49.032 --> 01:28:51.241
Don't make that noise, Sharon.
I'm getting turned on.

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:53.786
My testosterone is going dancing.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:55.996
Get off me.

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:04.088
Is...? Is it true what they say about you?

01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:10.094
Kickstand. Really?

01:29:10.261 --> 01:29:13.680
Um, can I give you my cell phone number?

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:15.015
Please?

01:29:17.435 --> 01:29:20.521
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Burt Bacharach.
