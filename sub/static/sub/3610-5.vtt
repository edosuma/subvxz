[helicopter rotor sound]

00:29.071 --> 00:32.359
- What's that?
- Cheat sheet Faraday drew for me.

00:32.450 --> 00:35.237
You don't know where your boat is?

00:35.328 --> 00:36.784
I know where it is.

00:49.592 --> 00:52.459
Why are you flying directly
into the thunderhead?

00:52.553 --> 00:54.839
Why don't you just sit back
and let me do my job?

00:54.931 --> 00:57.013
[wind howling]

01:02.480 --> 01:03.720
[thunderclap]

01:03.814 --> 01:04.849
Is that Penelope?

01:06.984 --> 01:10.397
She told Charlie she didn't know
about this boat, correct?

01:10.488 --> 01:11.477
Aye.

01:11.614 --> 01:13.980
What do you expect to find
when you get there?

01:14.075 --> 01:15.531
Answers.

01:15.618 --> 01:17.074
[wind howling]

01:32.343 --> 01:33.332
Damn it!

01:37.014 --> 01:40.051
[beeping]

01:41.602 --> 01:42.933
Hold on!

01:46.107 --> 01:48.598
[man] On your sodding feet!

01:48.693 --> 01:50.649
Move, move, move!

01:52.863 --> 01:55.275
What are you waiting for, Hume?

02:00.746 --> 02:02.611
What's the matter, Hume?

02:02.707 --> 02:04.948
Did you not hear me?

02:05.042 --> 02:07.954
I'm sorry, sir.
I was having a dream, sir.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.785
You were having a dream, were you?

02:09.880 --> 02:13.543
What were you dreaming about?
That it took you so sodding long

02:13.634 --> 02:15.590
to get to your mark?!

02:18.472 --> 02:19.882
l was in a helicopter, sir.

02:21.017 --> 02:23.429
And there was a storm, sir, and...

02:23.561 --> 02:27.554
And... I don't remember the rest, sir.

02:28.691 --> 02:31.979
Well, at least it was
a bloody military dream.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.604
Right! All of you!

02:36.699 --> 02:39.406
In the yard, four minutes!

02:39.493 --> 02:43.827
And you can thank Private Hume
for having to do it in double time.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.745
Move!

02:45.833 --> 02:47.448
- [man] One, two...
- [men] Three!

02:47.543 --> 02:48.828
- One, two, three...
- Four!

02:48.919 --> 02:50.910
- One, two, three...
- Five!

02:51.047 --> 02:53.288
One hundred crunches.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.122
Go, go, go, go, go!

02:56.052 --> 02:58.134
One, two, three...

02:58.220 --> 03:00.506
I hope your dream
was worth this, mate.

03:00.598 --> 03:02.839
Sorry, pal. Just...

03:02.933 --> 03:06.676
I've never had a dream so vivid.
It was like I was actually there.

03:06.771 --> 03:09.183
You got something to say, Hume?

03:09.273 --> 03:10.604
| asked you a question!

03:15.363 --> 03:16.853
We're almost through it.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.448
| see daylight.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.206
What do you think you're doing?
Desmond.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.746
Hey, you all right?

03:28.959 --> 03:29.948
Who are you?

03:31.587 --> 03:33.623
[shouting] How do you know my name?

03:54.235 --> 03:55.475
Here you go.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.237
All right, they took off a day ago.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.491
- Why haven't we heard from them?
- I'm gonna tell you again,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.742
as I've been telling you, I don't know!

04:09.834 --> 04:12.917
You heard the same thing as I did
when we called the boat.

04:13.003 --> 04:16.746
- What makes you think I know anything?
- Because you're not worried.

04:16.841 --> 04:19.332
- Excuse me?
- Your boat's 40 miles off the coast.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.335
lt should've taken them, what,
20 minutes to get there?

04:22.430 --> 04:23.761
Why aren't you worried?

04:23.848 --> 04:26.385
Should I wring my hands together

04:26.475 --> 04:30.059
- and whisper a prayer on their behalf?
- Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

04:30.146 --> 04:32.603
Maybe we should just tell them.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.939
Tell us what?

04:36.026 --> 04:39.860
Dan, let's not confuse anyone.

04:39.947 --> 04:44.111
Well, Daniel,
maybe if you talk real slow,

04:44.201 --> 04:45.862
we'll be able to follow.

04:49.623 --> 04:53.286
Your perception of how long
your friends have been gone...

04:54.378 --> 04:58.587
...it's not necessarily how long
they've actually been gone.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.008
- What does that mean?
- This is a mistake.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.129
It'll be fine, it'll be fine.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.714
As long as Frank flew
on the bearings I gave him.

05:08.851 --> 05:11.718
If he stayed on it, it'll be fine.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.473
And What if he didn't?

05:14.732 --> 05:17.474
Then there might be side effects.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.069
We're at 2,000 feet. Sit!

05:22.156 --> 05:23.987
- What am I doing here?
- What's going on?

05:24.074 --> 05:26.816
- Something's wrong with Desmond.
- Hold him in his seat!

05:26.911 --> 05:28.776
- I'm trying!
- Let go of me!

05:28.913 --> 05:31.700
Keep him away from the stick!
We'll be there in two minutes!

06:11.205 --> 06:13.321
[thud]

06:22.132 --> 06:24.043
What are you doing back?
Who are they?

06:24.134 --> 06:25.635
Survivors of 815.

06:27.054 --> 06:30.171
You dropped them here.
What the hell were you thinking?

06:30.975 --> 06:32.761
- Where am |?
- Just take it easy.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.058
Who are you people?
What am I doing here?

06:35.145 --> 06:36.885
- Who are you?
- My friend has...

06:36.981 --> 06:39.063
I'm not your friend! I don't know you!

06:39.149 --> 06:41.310
I don't know you!

06:42.528 --> 06:45.645
- When did he start doing this?
- He was fine when we took off.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.402
We hit some weather... Faraday said
as long as I stayed on the vector...

06:49.493 --> 06:50.482
OK. Go.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.699
Wait, wait, wait.
What's your name, my friend?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.327
- Sayid.
- OK, Sayid.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.876
We're gonna take your buddy
down to the sick bay.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.670
- I'm going with him.
- Let a doctor look at him first

07:03.799 --> 07:05.460
then you can come down.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.166
You got my word on that, OK?

07:15.269 --> 07:17.260
- All right.
- Listen to me.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.596
This is a mistake, right?
I don't know these people.

07:20.691 --> 07:23.182
- I understand.
- No, this is wrong!

07:23.277 --> 07:26.269
I'm not supposed to be here!

07:26.363 --> 07:29.025
[man] Twenty, 21, 22...

07:29.116 --> 07:31.607
"Here?" Here what?

07:31.702 --> 07:34.409
What the hell are you doing
on your feet?

07:34.496 --> 07:36.953
Are you finished with your crunches

07:37.041 --> 07:38.531
because you want to run?!

07:38.626 --> 07:42.539
Right! Squad, on yourfeet!

07:44.632 --> 07:46.293
Right face!

07:46.383 --> 07:49.796
Ten kilometers! Go, go, go, go, go!

07:49.887 --> 07:52.924
Get moving, or so help me
I'll kill you myself!

07:55.392 --> 07:57.849
[thunderclap]

07:59.938 --> 08:02.190
What the hell's the matter
with you, Des?

08:02.274 --> 08:04.310
If I told you, you'd think l was crazy.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.858
I already know you're crazy.

08:08.030 --> 08:12.148
This morning, when l was
in the yard doing crunches...

08:14.828 --> 08:16.238
...I left.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.199
What do you mean you "left?"

08:20.084 --> 08:22.951
l was on a boat.

08:23.045 --> 08:26.253
And then I was back here,
right where I started.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.501
Des, if you're trying to get tossed...

08:28.592 --> 08:30.628
Billy, I'm telling you the truth, man.

08:33.097 --> 08:36.009
Who else was on this... boat?

08:36.100 --> 08:38.056
Anyone you recognize?

08:40.145 --> 08:41.430
Penny.

08:44.817 --> 08:47.308
There was a photo.
Penny was in the photo.

08:47.403 --> 08:51.112
Wha...?! Oi, Des! Where are you going?

08:51.198 --> 08:54.281
[men shouting marches]

09:00.874 --> 09:02.580
Thanks for this morning, Hume.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.252
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Watch your step.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.718
Watch it. Watch your step. Take it easy.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.425
I'm not here.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.973
This... This isn't happening.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.848
You are here, and this is happening.

09:23.981 --> 09:27.724
- Look, we're gonna take care of you.
- What am I doing here?

09:27.818 --> 09:31.060
- It's all right. You're gonna be OK.
- Who are you people?

09:31.155 --> 09:34.818
Well, my name is Keamy,
and this is Omar.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.321
I'm from Vegas, he's from Florida.
But as for where we are...

09:38.454 --> 09:40.240
We last ported in Fiji.

09:41.457 --> 09:44.164
So at least we know
we're still in the Pacific.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.419
All right, my friend.
You just relax, OK?

09:53.510 --> 09:54.920
We're gonna go get the doc,

09:55.012 --> 09:57.594
and he's gonna want to ask you
some questions

09:57.681 --> 10:00.548
- to help us sort all this out.
- What do you mean, sort out?

10:00.642 --> 10:02.894
What do you mean?
I'm not supposed to be here!

10:02.978 --> 10:05.936
I'm not supposed to be here!
Open this door!

10:06.023 --> 10:08.514
- Open this door!
- [man] Hey!

10:11.445 --> 10:13.436
Hey, hey.

10:17.701 --> 10:21.740
lt's happening to you too, isn't it?

10:41.225 --> 10:44.012
[shouting]

10:57.658 --> 11:00.900
What's happening to Desmond?
Your friends know what's wrong.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.452
- If they do, they're not sharing.
- We'll share we took off at dusk

11:04.540 --> 11:06.747
and landed in the middle of the day.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.911
Listen, I don't know
what's happening to your buddy.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.497
But you gotta trust me
when | tell you this:

11:15.592 --> 11:17.799
I am trying to help you.

11:17.928 --> 11:21.170
You want to help me?
Give me your phone.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.426
Let me call my people.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.512
You give me that weapon,
and I'll give you this phone.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.770
Be quick.
Don't go trying to call Baghdad.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.981
Those phones only call each other.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.239
[phone ringing]

11:46.415 --> 11:48.030
[phone beeps]

11:48.125 --> 11:50.867
- Hello?
- Jack, it’s Sayid.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.747
I’m on the freighter.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.829
Are you OK? Where have you been?

11:54.923 --> 11:57.380
Something happened during the flight...

11:57.467 --> 11:59.753
...and now Desmond's in their sick bay.

11:59.845 --> 12:02.382
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.337
All right, you're on speaker.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.181
On the helicopter,
something happened to Desmond.

12:07.269 --> 12:10.181
He doesn't appear to recognize me
or know where he is.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.355
Side effects?

12:15.819 --> 12:17.559
Wait, your friend Desmond,

12:17.654 --> 12:21.897
has he recently been exposed
to high levels of radiation

12:21.992 --> 12:23.983
or electromagnetism?

12:27.164 --> 12:28.904
OK, look, we don't know why,

12:28.999 --> 12:31.115
but going to and coming from the island

12:31.209 --> 12:34.918
some people can get a little confused.

12:35.005 --> 12:38.213
So, what, is this amnesia?

12:41.887 --> 12:43.798
No. This is not amnesia.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.223
Hey. Hey.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.968
Hey! Can you hear me?

12:52.147 --> 12:53.387
Are you all right?

12:53.482 --> 12:55.188
Hello?

12:58.820 --> 13:01.197
l was just on a Ferris wheel.

13:05.327 --> 13:10.538
See, Ray? I'm not crazy.
lt's happening to him too, Ray.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.244
It's gonna happen to you.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.200
It's gonna happen to all of us.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.332
Everyone. Once we start heading
to that island again.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.505
Would you please step aside?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.625
No, no... Ray, no.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.631
I need you to relax for a minute.

13:25.722 --> 13:29.089
No! No, it's not gonna stop it, Ray.
Nothing can stop it, Ray!

13:29.184 --> 13:31.095
Nothing can stop this...!

13:36.650 --> 13:39.733
- And how are you feeling?
- What the bloody hell is going on?!

13:39.820 --> 13:43.312
- I understand you're disoriented...
- You won't stick me with that!

13:43.407 --> 13:45.614
I don't want to stick you with anything.

13:45.701 --> 13:48.317
If it's OK, ljust want
to check your eyes.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.788
- Why?
- So I can help you.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.800
What's your name?

14:08.473 --> 14:09.849
Desmond.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.095
Desmond.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.933
Why don't you tell me about
the last thing you remember?

14:40.547 --> 14:43.129
[dial tones]

14:45.385 --> 14:47.967
[ringing]

14:51.058 --> 14:52.514
[woman] Hello?

14:54.394 --> 14:55.975
Penny?

14:58.273 --> 14:59.934
What do you want, Desmond?

15:01.276 --> 15:02.857
Penny, listen, l'm...

15:03.653 --> 15:05.735
I'm in trouble.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.734
I think...
I think something's happened to me.

15:09.576 --> 15:13.410
I'm confused and...
I need to see you.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.574
You broke off with me
and then you joined the army,

15:18.668 --> 15:22.752
and now you call with some expectation
I still care about you?

15:22.839 --> 15:25.421
Yeah, I’d say you are confused,
Desmond.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.670
No, I'm not. It's...

15:27.761 --> 15:30.719
Look, I've got two days leave
starting tonight.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.305
- Can I... can I come and see you?
- No.

15:34.392 --> 15:37.884
No. And don't bother showing up
at the flat either. I've moved.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.264
Moved? Where?

15:39.356 --> 15:41.221
It doesn't matter.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.729
Look, Desmond, I’m going to go.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.732
- Please don't call me again.
- No, listen, Penny, l...

15:47.823 --> 15:48.812
...need you.

15:53.203 --> 15:56.115
Did you just experience something,
Desmond?

15:59.042 --> 16:02.500
Frank, you're not supposed
to be here, definitely not with him.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.954
Sorry, but I got Faraday calling.
He needs to talk to this guy...

16:06.049 --> 16:10.133
- Faraday's not talking to my patient.
- He's not your patient!

16:10.220 --> 16:11.801
Give Desmond the phone.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.721
- [alarm blares]
- Give him the phone now!

16:16.768 --> 16:17.803
[phone beeps]

16:19.813 --> 16:21.678
- Hello?
- Desmond.

16:21.773 --> 16:25.937
Desmond, my name is Daniel Faraday.
We met yesterday before you took off,

16:26.027 --> 16:28.359
but I'm guessing
you don't remember that.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.858
- Took off... What?
- We don't have long to talk,

16:30.949 --> 16:34.441
so I need you to tell me
what year you think it is.

16:34.536 --> 16:37.403
What do you mean what year
do I think...? It's 1996.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.577
[alarm continues]

16:42.043 --> 16:46.286
All right. Desmond, look,
you gotta tell me, where are you?

16:46.381 --> 16:49.293
- l'm... I'm in some kind of sick bay.
- [alarm continues]

16:49.384 --> 16:52.501
No, not right now, Desmond.
Where are you supposed to be?

16:52.596 --> 16:54.632
Where are you in 1996?

16:54.723 --> 16:57.760
I'm at Camp Millar.
It's a Royal Scots regiment.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.637
It's just north of Glasgow.

16:59.728 --> 17:02.845
- Dan, you might...
- No, no, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

17:04.107 --> 17:07.099
Desmond, listen,
when it happens again,

17:07.194 --> 17:08.775
I need you to get on a train.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.190
Get on a train and go to Oxford,

17:11.281 --> 17:14.990
Oxford University, Queen’s College
Physics Department.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.032
What? Why?

17:18.371 --> 17:21.659
Because I need you to find me.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.292
- Where is it? Where is it?
- What?

17:30.383 --> 17:31.884
My journal, my journal.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.175
I need my journal,
or I won't believe him.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.512
- Why does he think he's in 1996?
- I don't know.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.590
lt's unpredictable.
It's a random effect.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.721
Sometimes the displacement's
a couple hours, sometimes years.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.848
Wait, this has happened before?

17:44.981 --> 17:47.814
The phone, now, please. Thank you.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.517
- Desmond, are you still there?
- [man] Hey, doc!

17:50.654 --> 17:52.610
Talk to him! I can't hold them for long.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.154
- [pounding]
- Yes! Yes, I'm here.

17:55.242 --> 17:58.029
OK, listen, when you find me
at Queen's College,

17:58.119 --> 18:02.078
I need you to tell me
to set the device to 2.342.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.998
- What?
- [Daniel] You got it? 2.342.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.542
It must be oscillating at 11 hertz.

18:07.629 --> 18:12.874
- You got it, Desmond?
- 2.342. Oscillate...

18:12.968 --> 18:16.631
[Daniel] Just remember that.
2.342 at 11 hertz, all right?

18:16.721 --> 18:20.634
One more thing, Desmond.
If the numbers don't convince me

18:20.725 --> 18:24.684
I need you to tell me
that you know about Eloise.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.021
Hey! Hey! Hey!

18:28.108 --> 18:29.644
Easy,easy!

18:29.734 --> 18:32.396
[Daniel] Desmond? Tell me
that you know about Eloise...

18:48.628 --> 18:50.619
[church bells ringing]

18:59.431 --> 19:01.547
[man talking]

19:03.435 --> 19:07.474
Original, the opposite of derivative.

19:07.564 --> 19:10.727
I am the one for you to impress,
Mr. Hollister.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.355
I'm not impressed.
So go, go try again.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.277
Sorry. Are you Daniel Faraday?

19:20.702 --> 19:24.490
- You are?
- Uh... Sorry. I'm Desmond Hume,

19:24.622 --> 19:27.079
and lwas told I could find you here.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.622
I think I've... just been to the future.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.172
- The future?
- Yes.

19:36.259 --> 19:41.595
I spoke to you there. You told me
to come here to Oxford to find you.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.260
You said you'd help me.

19:44.351 --> 19:47.309
Why didn't I just help you there,
in the future?

19:47.395 --> 19:48.805
Sorry?

19:48.938 --> 19:52.146
Why would I put you through
the headache of time travel.

19:52.233 --> 19:55.691
You know what I mean?
It just seems a little unnecessary.

19:57.113 --> 20:00.856
Don't you think my esteemed colleagues
could have come up with something

20:00.950 --> 20:02.611
just a little more believable?

20:02.702 --> 20:07.446
What kind of a prank is that?
Time paradox. So uninspired.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.375
Set your device to...

20:12.462 --> 20:16.046
...2.342 and make sure
it oscillates at 11.

20:23.640 --> 20:29.351
OK, now, you... You're gonna tell me
who told you those numbers.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.552
You did.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.060
Wait a second. This is ridiculous.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.482
I know about Eloise.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.908
What is all this?

20:49.999 --> 20:53.912
This is where I do the things
Oxford frowns upon.

20:54.921 --> 20:58.129
All right, this future version of me,

20:58.216 --> 21:00.707
he referenced this meeting, right?

21:00.802 --> 21:05.262
Obviously. So lwould remember
you coming to Oxford, right?

21:05.348 --> 21:07.430
I would remember this here right now.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.508
Actually... no.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.514
- No.
- Maybe you just forgot.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.605
Yeah, right. How would that happen?

21:16.985 --> 21:19.317
So this is changing the future?

21:19.404 --> 21:21.269
You can't change the future.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.696
- What's that for?
- Radiation.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.403
[electronic squeaking]

21:26.494 --> 21:28.280
- Do | get one?
- You don't need one.

21:28.371 --> 21:31.329
It's for prolonged exposure.
I do this 20 times a day.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.873
So, what do you put on your head?

21:34.752 --> 21:36.253
Uaughs]

21:37.380 --> 21:38.586
Yeah.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.253
[beeping]

21:45.263 --> 21:46.548
This...

21:47.223 --> 21:49.839
This is Eloise.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.809
- What does this do?
- This,

22:00.904 --> 22:03.270
if the numbers you gave me are correct,

22:03.364 --> 22:05.150
what this will do...

22:05.241 --> 22:09.735
...is unstick Eloise in time,
just like you.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.512
- What happened?
- Wait. She's not back yet.

22:33.603 --> 22:36.561
There she is. OK.

22:36.648 --> 22:39.264
Here goes everything.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.359
Come on, come on. Come on.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.899
That's it. Come on. That's it.

22:50.912 --> 22:52.368
Yes, yes.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.662
Yes!

22:55.291 --> 22:56.701
Uaughs]

23:00.463 --> 23:03.125
Ya! Ah!

23:03.216 --> 23:06.834
It worked! This is incredible.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.795
How is a rat running through a maze
so incredible?

23:09.931 --> 23:11.467
What is incredible

23:11.599 --> 23:14.841
is | just finished the maze
this morning.

23:14.936 --> 23:19.805
I'm not gonna teach her how to run it
until an hour from now.

23:26.948 --> 23:31.988
- So you sent her to the future?
- No, her consciousness. Her mind.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.575
So how does that help me?

23:36.666 --> 23:38.907
You? Help you?

23:39.002 --> 23:41.914
I don't understand. Didn't I send you
back here to help me?

23:42.005 --> 23:43.916
I don't know why you sent me here.

23:44.007 --> 23:47.170
All I know about you is you end up
on some bloody island.

23:49.178 --> 23:50.759
An island?

23:50.847 --> 23:52.758
What island? Why would I go to an...?

23:52.849 --> 23:54.385
Desmond, give me the phone.

23:54.475 --> 23:55.851
[alarm blaring]

23:55.935 --> 23:57.766
Come on, everybody relax! Listen!

23:57.854 --> 24:01.642
Daniel wanted to talk to the guy,
so we brought him the phone, that's all.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.770
- You let Faraday talk to him?
- He said he could help.

24:04.861 --> 24:07.728
- Faraday can't even help himself!
- Outside now.

24:07.864 --> 24:11.322
- The captain wants to talk to you.
- I want to talk to your captain.

24:11.409 --> 24:12.945
I'll be sure to let him know.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.742
In the meantime have a seat.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.876
- I need to get back.
- Back where? The island?

24:24.005 --> 24:26.963
He said he could help me,
tell me what I needed to do.

24:27.050 --> 24:29.632
Desmond, can you please
explain to me...?

24:29.719 --> 24:30.879
[man] Desmond?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.256
You're Desmond?

24:34.682 --> 24:35.842
Do I know you?

24:37.101 --> 24:38.887
l'm George Minkowski.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.811
I'm the communications officer.

24:41.898 --> 24:44.059
Before they strapped me down here,

24:44.150 --> 24:48.189
all the calls to and from this boat
came through me in the radio room.

24:49.072 --> 24:51.063
And every so often...

24:51.157 --> 24:55.867
...| get this flashing light
on my console.

24:55.953 --> 25:00.993
An incoming call. We were under
strict orders never to answer it.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.958
So? What's that got to do with me?

25:05.046 --> 25:07.332
Those calls came from your girlfriend.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.089
Penelope Widmore.

25:23.731 --> 25:26.313
- What happened?
- Ooo! You're back.

25:26.401 --> 25:29.939
And you were out almost 75 minutes.

25:30.697 --> 25:31.982
- Out?
- Oh, yeah.

25:32.073 --> 25:35.315
You just went catatonic
right in the middle of a sentence.

25:35.410 --> 25:39.779
I carried you to the chair. I take it
you were in the future again?

25:39.872 --> 25:40.987
Aye.

25:41.082 --> 25:43.994
- For how long?
- I don't know. Five minutes.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.541
Why does this keep happening?

25:49.632 --> 25:53.295
In your case, I'm guessing
the progression is exponential.

25:54.804 --> 25:58.547
Each time your consciousness jumps
it's harder to jump back.

25:58.641 --> 26:01.849
I would be careful crossing the street
if I were you.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.568
What happened to her?

26:09.652 --> 26:12.234
- She died.
- I can see that. How?

26:12.321 --> 26:14.152
Brain aneurysm, probably.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.231
I'm gonna do an autopsy later.

26:17.326 --> 26:21.444
- Is that gonna happen to me?
- The effects vary from case to case.

26:22.123 --> 26:26.457
Answer me! If this keeps happening,
am I gonna die?

26:28.337 --> 26:29.588
I don't know.

26:35.470 --> 26:39.213
I think Eloise's brain short-circuited.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.632
The jumps between the present
and the future,

26:42.727 --> 26:46.345
she eventually... couldn't tell
which was which. She had no anchor.

26:46.481 --> 26:50.474
- What do you mean "anchor?"
- Something familiar in both times.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.433
See this? This is all variables.

26:52.528 --> 26:56.271
lt's random, it's chaotic.
Every equation needs stability,

26:56.365 --> 27:00.825
something known. It's called a constant.
Desmond, you have no constant.

27:02.497 --> 27:05.239
You go to the future
nothing there is familiar.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.660
So if you want to stop this...

27:08.377 --> 27:11.289
...then you need to find
something there,

27:11.380 --> 27:15.043
something that you really,
really care about...

27:16.511 --> 27:19.924
...that also exists back here in 1996.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.299
This constant...

27:27.271 --> 27:29.307
...can it be a person?

27:30.107 --> 27:31.643
Yeah, maybe.

27:31.734 --> 27:34.191
But you have to make
some kind of contact.

27:35.530 --> 27:38.988
I thought you said you were off
on a boat, middle of nowhere?

27:43.538 --> 27:46.575
- Who are you calling?
- I'm calling my bloody constant.

27:46.666 --> 27:47.781
[beeping over phone]

27:47.875 --> 27:50.582
[woman] The number you have dialed
has been disconnected.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.416
Hey, hey, are you OK?

28:04.600 --> 28:07.307
You look a lot older now, huh?

28:08.688 --> 28:11.145
Welcome back, Desmond.

28:11.232 --> 28:12.438
I need to call Penny.

28:12.525 --> 28:15.107
Calling your girlfriend
is not our priority.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.357
Listen, brother, I don't know you
but you seem to know me,

28:18.447 --> 28:21.610
so if you and me are friends...

28:21.742 --> 28:23.403
...then I need your help.

28:23.494 --> 28:25.359
I need to call Penny now.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.945
Whoa, you boys are getting
way ahead of yourselves.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.702
Two days ago someone
sabotaged all the equipment.

28:30.793 --> 28:34.206
We lost all communication
with the mainland.

28:34.338 --> 28:37.045
I probably could've fixed it,
but then...

28:37.133 --> 28:39.749
- Then I went nuts.
- Where's the radio room?

28:39.844 --> 28:43.177
It's one deck up. I'll take you there.

28:43.264 --> 28:44.629
Come on.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.387
How do we get out of here?

28:49.228 --> 28:50.934
Through the door.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.611
Looks like you guys
have a friend on this boat.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.404
Hey, your...

29:08.831 --> 29:09.946
Your nose, brother.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.791
It's clear.

29:18.132 --> 29:19.121
Let's...

29:35.191 --> 29:38.183
[man] The Black Rock set sail
from Portsmouth, England

29:38.319 --> 29:43.188
March 22, 1845 on a trading mission
to the kingdom of Siam

29:43.324 --> 29:45.781
when she was tragically lost at sea.

29:45.868 --> 29:48.450
The only known artifact of this journey

29:48.537 --> 29:50.949
is the journal of the ship's first mate,

29:51.040 --> 29:54.999
which was discovered among the artifacts
of pirates on L'ile Sainte Marie

29:55.086 --> 29:56.121
seven years later.

29:57.254 --> 30:00.621
The contents of this journal
have never been made public

30:00.716 --> 30:04.083
to anyone outside the family
of the seller, Tovard Hanso.

30:04.178 --> 30:06.840
We open the bidding on Lot 2342

30:06.931 --> 30:09.468
at £150,000.

30:10.226 --> 30:12.217
One-hundred-fifty thousand, sir.

30:12.311 --> 30:16.475
To 160? Do I hear...?
One-sixty, sir. One-seventy, sir.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.477
One-eighty on the phone.
Two hundred thousand pounds.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.355
Two-hundred-twenty thousand
pounds. Two-forty?

30:22.446 --> 30:26.234
Two-hundred-sixty thousand
pounds, sir. Two-eighty?

30:26.367 --> 30:29.074
On the phone l have 300,000...
Three-twenty.

30:29.203 --> 30:32.195
Three-hundred-forty thousand pounds.
Three-sixty?

30:32.289 --> 30:36.282
- Three-eighty.
- This auction's by appointment only.

30:36.377 --> 30:37.833
Do I hear £400,000?

30:37.920 --> 30:40.787
- Listen, ljust need to speak to...
- I'm sorry, sir.

30:41.841 --> 30:46.380
Sold, for £380,000 to bidder 755.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.303
- Thank you, sir.
- Just for a minute, all right?

30:49.432 --> 30:52.299
- Look... Mr. Widmore.
- Desmond.

30:52.393 --> 30:53.849
Can I have a word, sir?

30:53.936 --> 30:56.427
- [man] I'm sorry, Mr. Widmore...
- That's fine.

30:58.274 --> 30:59.639
Walk with me.

31:07.783 --> 31:10.035
Your word. Let's have it.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.530
I need to get in touch with Penny.

31:16.584 --> 31:20.668
I don't know how to reach her,
and her number's been disconnected.

31:22.465 --> 31:26.834
There was a time when, if you'd asked
her to marry you, she'd have said yes.

31:26.969 --> 31:28.880
But fortunately...

31:28.971 --> 31:31.383
...your cowardice won out instead.

31:37.730 --> 31:40.437
I take it you've had second thoughts.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.939
And you'd like her to give you
another chance.

31:46.989 --> 31:48.320
Why do you hate me so much?

31:48.407 --> 31:51.774
[chuckles] It's not me who hates you.

31:54.163 --> 31:56.404
Here's her address.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.329
I'll let her tell you herself.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.169
[water running]

32:18.562 --> 32:20.098
Desmond.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.606
I know. It's getting harder.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.821
It starts happening faster too.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.605
Come on, let's move.

32:33.786 --> 32:36.072
Hey, how did this happen to you?

32:37.123 --> 32:38.829
We were anchored here,

32:38.916 --> 32:42.875
waiting for our orders,
bored out of our minds.

32:44.046 --> 32:46.537
Me and Brandon,
he's one of the crew members,

32:46.674 --> 32:48.915
we took out the ship's tender.

32:50.344 --> 32:52.505
We just wanted to see the island.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.140
So we had to turn around.

32:58.227 --> 33:01.390
- Where is he?
- In a body bag.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.608
There.

33:10.739 --> 33:13.947
- Who did this?
- You got me.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.571
But when the captain finds out,
| feel sorry...

33:21.083 --> 33:24.871
After your call, someone has to tell me
precisely what is going on.

33:27.715 --> 33:30.752
- Can you fix it, brother?
- I need a minute.

33:33.095 --> 33:35.211
Do you have the number
to make the call?

33:36.599 --> 33:40.183
George, wake up, wake up.
You're going to come back.

33:40.269 --> 33:42.601
Desmond, do you know the number?

33:45.900 --> 33:48.107
- No.
- Well, you better remember it.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.784
It's 2004?

33:58.871 --> 34:01.283
I didn't realize
it was almost Christmas.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.079
It's been...

34:03.709 --> 34:05.210
Desmond.

34:09.131 --> 34:10.632
No!

34:14.136 --> 34:16.172
I... can't...

34:16.263 --> 34:18.800
...get... back.

34:30.778 --> 34:32.439
What happened to him?

34:35.574 --> 34:38.691
The same thing
that's gonna happen to me.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.128
Desmond?

35:38.971 --> 35:41.257
- What are you doing here?
- I had to.

35:41.348 --> 35:44.431
I tried to call you,
but you disconnected your phone.

35:44.518 --> 35:46.179
Yeah, because I moved.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.436
I don't know if you're
getting the signals,

35:49.523 --> 35:52.310
but I'm trying to make a clean break.
So if you don't mind...

35:52.401 --> 35:55.438
Wait, wait, wait. Please, ljust need
to get your new phone number.

35:55.529 --> 35:58.521
- Why would I give you that?
- I made a huge mistake.

35:58.615 --> 36:02.153
I should never have broken up with you.
I know that now, I'm sorry.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.656
- Don't. Just don't do this.
- I understand.

36:04.747 --> 36:07.659
I know it's too late to change things,

36:07.750 --> 36:10.366
but I need to tell you something.

36:10.461 --> 36:13.999
I need you to listen to me.
I know it's gonna sound ridiculous,

36:14.089 --> 36:16.671
but... Please, Pen.

36:18.260 --> 36:20.091
I need you to listen to me.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.432
Just say what you need
to say and then go.

36:33.609 --> 36:37.272
I know this doesn't make sense
because it doesn't make sense to me.

36:37.363 --> 36:39.604
But eight years from now...

36:41.450 --> 36:42.656
...I need to call you.

36:42.743 --> 36:46.156
And I can't call you
if I don't have your number.

36:47.414 --> 36:50.121
- What?
- Penny, just give me your number.

36:50.292 --> 36:53.375
I know I've ruined things. I know
you think things are over,

36:53.462 --> 36:57.501
but they're not. If there's any part of
you that still believes in us, just...

36:57.633 --> 37:00.966
- ...give me your number.
- What's to say you won't call tonight?

37:01.053 --> 37:05.467
I won't call... for eight years.

37:07.810 --> 37:10.301
December 24, 2004.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.640
Christmas Eve.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.481
I promise.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.103
Please, Pen.

37:24.326 --> 37:26.783
If I give you the number,
will you leave?

37:27.496 --> 37:28.736
Aye.

37:35.671 --> 37:39.004
7946-0893.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.046
7946-0893. 7946...

37:43.137 --> 37:45.674
All that, and you're not gonna
write it down?

37:48.642 --> 37:50.382
It wouldn't do any good.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.181
You have to keep that number.

37:54.273 --> 37:58.061
- Get out! Get out!
- Just remember, December 24, 2004.

37:58.152 --> 38:00.859
If you still care about me,
you have to answer.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.688
I'm not crazy, Penny!
You have to believe me! You have to...

38:03.782 --> 38:05.693
Trust me.

38:05.826 --> 38:07.782
I do trust you.

38:07.870 --> 38:10.407
But you still have to remember
that number.

38:12.833 --> 38:15.245
7946-0893.

38:15.335 --> 38:16.711
7946-0893.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.252
7946-0893. It's a London number.

38:19.339 --> 38:20.624
Excellent timing.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.006
The patch is done,

38:24.094 --> 38:26.676
but I don't know how long
the battery will last.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.218
I hope she's there.

38:32.019 --> 38:33.509
I hope so too.

39:10.432 --> 39:12.423
[Penny over phone] Hello?

39:14.394 --> 39:16.726
Penny?

39:16.813 --> 39:18.474
[Penny] Desmond?

39:29.993 --> 39:31.984
Penny. Penny, you answered.

39:33.664 --> 39:35.074
You answered, Penny.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.829
Des, where are you?

39:41.088 --> 39:43.329
l'm...

39:44.633 --> 39:47.545
l'm... I'm on a boat...

39:49.471 --> 39:52.258
l've... I've been on an island and...

39:54.560 --> 39:57.302
- Oh, my God, Penny, is that really you?
- Yeah.

39:58.272 --> 39:59.261
Yes, it's me.

40:02.484 --> 40:03.599
You believed me.

40:05.612 --> 40:08.319
You still care about me.

40:08.407 --> 40:11.865
Des, I've been looking for you
for the past three years.

40:11.952 --> 40:15.319
I know about the island.
I've been researching...

40:17.833 --> 40:20.415
...and then when I spoke
to your friend Charlie,

40:20.502 --> 40:24.836
that's when I knew you were still alive.
That’s when l knewl wasn’t crazy.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.922
[static]

40:28.010 --> 40:30.501
- Des, are you still there?
- Yes, yes, I'm here.

40:30.596 --> 40:33.804
- I'm still here. Can you hear me?
- Yeah, that's better.

40:34.683 --> 40:36.924
I love you, Penny.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.266
I've always loved you.

40:43.358 --> 40:44.564
I'm so sorry.

40:47.279 --> 40:49.361
I love you.

40:49.448 --> 40:50.483
I love you too.

40:51.325 --> 40:53.316
- I don't know where I am.
- I'll find you.

40:53.410 --> 40:55.446
- I promise... I'll come back.
- No matter what.

40:55.537 --> 40:57.653
- I won't give up, I promise.
- I promise.

40:57.748 --> 40:59.158
- I love you.
- I love you.

40:59.249 --> 41:01.535
[static]

41:10.302 --> 41:13.760
I'm sorry. The power source
went dead. That's all we had.

41:23.899 --> 41:26.185
Thank you, Sayid.

41:30.739 --> 41:32.445
It was enough.

41:35.327 --> 41:37.238
Are you all right now?

41:40.248 --> 41:41.328
Aye.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.123
l'm perfect.
