00:26.402 --> 00:29.029
You are never more alive
than when you’re a teenager.

00:30.406 --> 00:32.241
Your brain is flush
with chemicals

00:32.324 --> 00:36.620
that can turn your life into
a story of epic proportions.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.165
An A-minus feels like
the Pulitzer,

00:39.248 --> 00:42.877
a lonely Saturday night
is an eternity of solitude,

00:42.960 --> 00:47.047
and your lab partner becomes
the great love of your life.

00:47.131 --> 00:49.759
And yet, by the start
of my senior year,

00:49.842 --> 00:52.219
nothing interesting
or remarkable

00:52.303 --> 00:54.096
had ever happened to me.

00:54.180 --> 00:57.308
-I was grateful for my life.
-

00:57.391 --> 00:59.935
I had my best friends--
all two of them...

01:00.019 --> 01:01.020
Relax.
You got this.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.354
...parents who met

01:02.438 --> 01:04.565
and fell in love
when they were my age,

01:04.648 --> 01:06.525
and my writing.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.371
But a platform was pointless

01:19.455 --> 01:21.957
unless I actually had
something to say.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.709
And I didn’t,

01:23.793 --> 01:26.921
because nothing worth writing
about had ever happened to me.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.635
Then, on the day
I found out about the job,

01:32.718 --> 01:34.220
something finally happened.

02:05.543 --> 02:07.086
Hi, guys.
Thanks for swinging by.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.505
Come on in.
You want us both?

02:09.588 --> 02:10.965
Yes, both of you
would be great.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.466
Come on.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.595
Grace just transferred
here from East River,

02:16.679 --> 02:19.348
where she spent two years
writing for the Gazette.

02:19.431 --> 02:22.726
You both possess
remarkable depth
for writers your age.

02:23.811 --> 02:27.064
Which is why I think
that you two will make

02:27.147 --> 02:30.150
a truly dynamic
editor-in-chief duo.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.069
No.
What?

02:32.862 --> 02:34.655
Uh, one more time?

02:34.738 --> 02:37.199
I don’t want
to be an editor.

02:37.283 --> 02:38.492
But thank you.

02:40.536 --> 02:41.537
Um...

02:41.620 --> 02:43.622
Hey.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.875
-Why’d you say no?
-What?

02:45.958 --> 02:48.127
Why’d you say no?

02:48.210 --> 02:50.629
Why do you care?
What?

02:50.713 --> 02:51.922
Why do you care?

02:52.006 --> 02:54.300
Uh... I don’t.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.553
It’s just
a good opportunity
for a writer, I guess.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.471
I just don’t get
why you would say no.

02:59.555 --> 03:02.182
All right, well,
don’t let it
keep you up at night.

03:08.898 --> 03:11.400
Oh, shit.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.818
What?

03:14.320 --> 03:16.447
I just missed
my bus.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.700
Can’t walk?

03:19.783 --> 03:22.036
Um... no,
I mean, I can.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.454
It’s just far.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.832
Uh, that’s why
I take the bus.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.931
My house is up there.

03:43.265 --> 03:46.268
I have a car.
I can give you
a ride if you want.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.021
Yeah?

03:50.522 --> 03:52.066
Thanks.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.990
Hey, so you like
"Nehradah"?

04:01.951 --> 04:04.036
Neruda.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.832
Oh. Um...

04:08.916 --> 04:10.584
Yeah, well,
I only read a stanza,

04:10.668 --> 04:13.629
but I thought
it was really beautiful.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.382
You think so?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.511
Yeah. Do you not?

04:21.929 --> 04:23.597
No, I just think
that’s what people say

04:23.681 --> 04:26.767
when they read a poem
that they don’t understand.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.439
Hmm.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.781
Finish it.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.660
And let me know
if you still
feel the same way.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.837
Huh.
It’s a cool place.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.799
How come
you walk to school
if you have a car?

04:58.882 --> 05:00.300
I don’t like driving.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.594
-Do you have a license?
-Yeah.

05:10.436 --> 05:12.146
It’s a good song.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.340
You live in a house
like this,
but you don’t have a car?

05:40.424 --> 05:44.470
-I guess my grades aren’t
good enough for a car, so...
-Hmm.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.432
Thanks a lot.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.775
Uh...

05:58.942 --> 06:00.319
Well,
I’ll see you tomorrow?

06:02.571 --> 06:03.739
Okay.

06:07.284 --> 06:10.287
Henry.
What’s up, Suds?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.122
You, uh, just get back
or something?

06:12.206 --> 06:13.749
Mmm, no.
Just leaving.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.334
I’m late.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.044
So, uh,
who’s the girl?

06:17.127 --> 06:19.588
-What girl?
- The one
that drove Henry home.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.216
A girl
drove you home?

06:22.299 --> 06:24.718
She left her car here
and walked away.

06:24.802 --> 06:25.803
Run.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.721
Yeah, when are you gonna
move back out again?

06:27.805 --> 06:30.641
Ignore her.
She’s declared war on love.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.143
No, just on
cheating assholes.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.062
Will you see him
today?
Oh, my God.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.271
He’s my attending,
Mom.

06:36.355 --> 06:37.981
I’ll see him
several times today.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.818
So, how was
the first day back?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.986
Good. Yeah.
It was good.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.738
Did you get it?

06:44.822 --> 06:46.532
Uh...

06:46.615 --> 06:47.866
-Yeah.
- Oh.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.785
Yeah, you did.

06:49.868 --> 06:50.869
Congratulations,
sweetie.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.788
Nice work.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.457
Okay, got to go.
Love you, guys.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.751
So, who’s the girl?

07:31.702 --> 07:34.121
"I do not love you
as if you were the salt-rose,

07:34.204 --> 07:38.167
topaz or arrow of carnations
that propagate fire.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.711
I love you as certain
dark things are to be loved,

07:40.794 --> 07:43.172
in secret, between the shadow
and the soul."

07:43.255 --> 07:45.174
"...the shadow
and the soul."

07:45.257 --> 07:47.301
"I love you like the plant
that does not bloom,

07:47.384 --> 07:49.386
but carries
within itself, hidden,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.096
the light of those flowers."

07:51.180 --> 07:54.141
"...thanks to your love,
lives darkly in my body..."

07:54.224 --> 07:56.894
"...a certain solid fragrance
that has risen from the earth.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.564
I love you without knowing
how or when or from where.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.692
I love you straightforwardly,
without complexities or pride,

08:03.775 --> 08:05.402
in which there is
no you nor I,

08:05.485 --> 08:09.239
so close that your hand
upon my chest is mine.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.826
So close that your hand upon
my chest is mine.

08:16.288 --> 08:19.208
So close that your eyes close
as I dream."

08:20.709 --> 08:24.379
-I have no idea what you said,
but it worked.
-What?

08:24.463 --> 08:27.424
I think the newspaper’s
gonna be a really
good thing for her.

08:28.967 --> 08:33.555
We will have four issues--
the first in November,
the last in June.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.516
The first three
are garden-variety
periodicals:

08:36.600 --> 08:40.020
hard-hitting news, sports,
features, the like.

08:40.103 --> 08:42.773
But the last one,
that’s where we get creative.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.983
With the help of the group,
Henry will choose a theme,

08:45.067 --> 08:47.653
and you will have
carte blanche
to explore that theme

08:47.736 --> 08:49.279
as you see fit.

08:49.363 --> 08:52.282
That last issue will be
this team’s legacy,

08:52.366 --> 08:54.910
an opportunity to share
your accrued wisdom

08:54.993 --> 08:57.371
with the students
behind you.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.998
I’m not just talking
about the four years
that you’ve spent

09:00.082 --> 09:01.750
within the walls
of this building.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.461
I am talking
bigger than that.

09:04.544 --> 09:10.008
I am talking about the totality
of your 17 years on this planet.

09:10.092 --> 09:12.469
Last but not least,
Grace here joins us

09:12.552 --> 09:15.138
from our neighboring school,
East River Preparatory,

09:15.222 --> 09:19.434
and will lend Henry
a helping hand
with all things editorial.

09:19.518 --> 09:23.438
Now, here’s what Kyle
and his team did for
last year’s final issue.

09:23.522 --> 09:26.525
Um, I’m sorry.
Uh, Kyle sucks.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.902
Very constructive, La.

09:28.986 --> 09:31.530
Well, okay, um...

09:31.613 --> 09:34.616
the final issue last year
did kind of suck.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.871
All right.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.920
Um, hey,
so I don’t know
what your thoughts...

09:47.004 --> 09:48.797
So,
I’m not writing.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.135
If you have something
to say, you can just
say it yourself,

09:53.218 --> 09:56.388
and I’ll help with,
like, editing
and design and...

09:56.471 --> 09:58.015
I handle design.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.351
Well, everything
other than design then.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.980
But just not...
just not writing.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.940
And I’m
assistant editor,

10:07.024 --> 10:08.859
because apparently
you worked very hard
for this,

10:08.942 --> 10:11.069
so it should be
all yours.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.656
Looks like
Cora’s into you again.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.033
Yo, what is the deal
with her?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.618
She’s making eyes at me,
laughing at all my jokes,

10:18.702 --> 10:21.496
and it’s like this
air pocket that’s, like,

10:21.580 --> 10:24.708
connecting us,
and it’s just filled with,
like, marshmallows,

10:24.791 --> 10:28.920
gummy bears, and freakin’
bubble gum and sparklies,

10:29.004 --> 10:30.589
and it’s just like,
if I eat it,

10:30.672 --> 10:33.842
I’m gonna get another cavity
like last year, and I can’t.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.052
Hmm,
good metaphor.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.054
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.388
Hey, Grace.
Hankard.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.848
I, um...
This is our bus!

10:39.931 --> 10:41.641
...actually didn’t get
a chance to tell you,

10:41.725 --> 10:43.393
I finished that poem.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.146
And, um... yeah.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.647
I still think
it’s beautiful,

10:47.731 --> 10:50.692
but not in the,
uh, normal kind
of bullshit way.

10:50.776 --> 10:53.111
Um, which, uh,
which I think is also

10:53.195 --> 10:55.238
kind of what
the poem’s about,
’cause, you know,

10:55.322 --> 11:00.077
Neruda’s love for her
doesn’t come from,
like, uh...

11:00.160 --> 11:03.163
sunshine and roses
and cliché stuff.

11:03.246 --> 11:06.875
You know,
it comes from,
um, her... flaws

11:06.958 --> 11:09.878
and her imperfections,
like, darker places.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.630
Hankard!
Uh,
comes from...

11:11.713 --> 11:13.507
Come on,
you flirt!

11:13.590 --> 11:15.425
...I guess who she has
the potential to be

11:15.509 --> 11:18.387
and not just
who she is.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.557
So, I don’t know.

11:22.641 --> 11:25.060
So, beautiful in
that kind of way,
you know.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.398
You’re gonna
miss your bus again.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.110
I see you.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.903
What’s he doing?

11:37.489 --> 11:40.367
Um, you think I could
get another ride?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.079
Sure.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.221
Thanks for letting me
drive myself home again.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.440
Where do you go to?
Why do you go?

12:11.523 --> 12:15.360
What are your colors?
What are your moods?

12:15.444 --> 12:19.281
To see you, I turn.
To know you, I burn.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.911
-Okay. Bye.
-
Oh, my God,

13:05.994 --> 13:07.621
it kills me
when she speaks Spanish.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.248
Don’t you want to say,
"What’s up?"
Why? So she can ghost me again?

13:10.332 --> 13:12.000
I mean...
See you, guys.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.543
Uh, see you.

13:14.711 --> 13:15.754
Bye.
Uh-huh.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.005
Bye.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.258
Fuck.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.384
Meh.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.638
Meh.
Meh-meh.

13:36.399 --> 13:40.153
What was that little
"meh-meh" thing?

13:40.237 --> 13:43.657
Uh... oh,
um... um...

13:44.950 --> 13:46.576
I just-- we--
when we’re just,

13:46.660 --> 13:48.537
um, I guess,
annoyed,
we just do that.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.205
I don’t know.
Mmm.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.748
Um...

13:53.458 --> 13:55.794
Uh, you think
you’d give me
a ride today, maybe?

14:02.217 --> 14:05.053
Hey, do you want
to come in and hang out
or something?

14:07.597 --> 14:09.766
I can’t today.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.017
Okay.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.644
Um...

14:12.727 --> 14:14.854
I’ll just see you
tomorrow then, so...
Okay.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.155
Henry?

14:24.239 --> 14:25.865
Hmm?

14:26.950 --> 14:29.369
Meet me here
at 6:00.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.704
Okay.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.039
Yeah, I can meet--
I’ll meet you there
at 6:00.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.583
Yeah.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.459
Bring a loaf
of bread.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.686
What happened to your car?
- It’s back at my house.

14:54.769 --> 14:57.230
Did you drive it
back and then
you walked here?

14:57.314 --> 14:58.815
We don’t need it.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.194
-

16:02.337 --> 16:03.338
Come on.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.054
It was a cotton mill
in the 1800s,

16:11.137 --> 16:13.264
and then...

16:13.348 --> 16:18.186
they made plastic bottles
until it shut down
in 1989, I think.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.331
You have to be quiet.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.913
Whoa.
-Shh.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.124
You’ll scare them away.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.546
Come here.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.263
Have you ever
had a girlfriend?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.307
Uh, no.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.267
Uh, not really.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.269
Why not?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.689
Uh...
You ever had
a boyfriend?

18:27.732 --> 18:28.983
No.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.694
So what’s the deal?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.530
I don’t know.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.699
Um...

18:38.159 --> 18:39.786
I’m not really good
at this stuff.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.872
Well, I thought
you were a writer.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.458
Uh... yeah,
I mean, exactly.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.252
I could probably
go home right now

18:47.335 --> 18:50.630
and write you something
about why I’ve never
had a girlfriend,

18:50.713 --> 18:52.674
like an essay
or whatever.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.969
Oh, so you just
have to edit everything.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.262
No,
it’s not editing.

18:57.345 --> 19:01.224
It’s just,
writing, I think,
sometimes helps me...

19:01.307 --> 19:04.978
understand myself,
I guess, ’cause...

19:05.061 --> 19:07.480
a lot of times,
I don’t really know
how I feel about something

19:07.564 --> 19:09.399
until I really sit down
and think about it.

19:09.482 --> 19:13.319
But, I mean,
you haven’t
shared much either.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.375
I did some of
my physical therapy
in a pool.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.503
Nine months ago,

19:30.587 --> 19:32.922
the car swerved
coming around a bend

19:33.006 --> 19:36.634
and hit the rock barrier
and the car flipped.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.971
Not that it really
even matters.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.357
When I look at that,

19:51.441 --> 19:54.193
it reminds me

19:54.277 --> 19:58.907
that people are just
the ashes of dead stars.

20:00.575 --> 20:03.953
We’re just a collection
of atoms that...

20:04.037 --> 20:06.581
come together
for a brief period
of time,

20:06.664 --> 20:10.251
and then...
we fall apart.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.507
When all of this
is over,

20:16.591 --> 20:20.929
and we’re dispersed back
into nothingness...

20:21.012 --> 20:23.014
we have
a clean slate.

20:24.682 --> 20:27.143
It’s like having
all of your sins
wiped away.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.980
Sure you don’t want
to write for the paper?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.737
What sins do you need
wiped away?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.565
I used to be a vandal.

21:15.733 --> 21:16.776
You did this?

21:17.986 --> 21:19.821
When I was 14.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.908
What is that,
like, Latin?

21:25.535 --> 21:27.870
What’s it mean?

21:30.373 --> 21:34.043
I’m tired.
I’m gonna... head home.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.378
Uh...

21:38.006 --> 21:39.173
Do you want me to...

21:39.257 --> 21:41.801
Can you find your way back?

21:41.884 --> 21:44.554
Yeah. Uh...

21:44.637 --> 21:46.389
But are you
all right?
Yeah, fine.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.100
Uh, thanks
for hanging out.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.394
Um...

21:52.687 --> 21:55.148
Yeah, sure. Anytime.

22:14.751 --> 22:18.087
When I’m not finished

22:18.171 --> 22:21.382
So much more

22:22.633 --> 22:26.429
Like never before

22:26.512 --> 22:29.557
Welcome to the floor

22:29.640 --> 22:31.726
And you’ve found...

22:31.809 --> 22:33.144
Why are you
still up?

22:33.227 --> 22:36.105
Um, just working
on this.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.652
Is that the one
Mom and Dad got you
on your birthday?

22:41.736 --> 22:43.863
Mm-hmm.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.407
Don’t-- hey.
It’s still drying.

22:46.491 --> 22:47.909
Touchy, touchy,
Henry.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.952
Need you

22:51.871 --> 22:53.331
Need you...

22:53.414 --> 22:57.710
It is an odd hobby
for a 17-year-old boy.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.349
Did you know that, uh,
heartbreak triggers

23:11.432 --> 23:14.519
the same areas of the brain
as physical pain?

23:19.857 --> 23:22.485
When I think
about him leaving me,

23:22.568 --> 23:26.948
my brain sends
a distress signal
to my nervous system.

23:28.366 --> 23:31.869
And it elevates
my blood pressure
and my heart rate,

23:31.953 --> 23:33.663
giving me chest pains.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.833
Okay.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.751
To get in...

23:40.044 --> 23:41.754
It’s happening right now.

23:41.838 --> 23:44.298
Do you want me
to go get Mom?

23:44.382 --> 23:45.675
Oh, God, no,
please.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.468
Jesus.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.615
Henry.
Um...

24:09.699 --> 24:10.992
What’s next?
Yeah.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.952
Um, uh, okay.

24:13.035 --> 24:16.539
Um, I was thinking
we all could
kind of just put out

24:16.622 --> 24:18.791
a few ideas of themes
for the final issue.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.251
No time
like the present.

24:20.334 --> 24:24.130
How about a trippy
Alice in Wonderland
theme?

24:24.213 --> 24:26.132
You know, like,
we all dropped acid

24:26.215 --> 24:27.884
and went down
the rabbit hole.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.219
Now, that’s tight.
I could work
with that.

24:31.929 --> 24:32.930
Grace?

24:34.891 --> 24:35.892
What?

24:35.975 --> 24:37.476
Any ideas?

24:37.560 --> 24:38.811
I don’t know.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.563
None?

24:40.646 --> 24:42.648
Yeah, that’s what
"I don’t know" means.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.903
Can I go to the bathroom?
I have to pee.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.988
Of course.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.576
Just ask her what’s going on.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.994
No,
I don’t know.

24:55.077 --> 24:57.622
I feel like
I don’t know her
like that yet.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.707
I don’t know.
You should follow her.

25:01.042 --> 25:02.251
What?
Yeah.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.253
Don’t you want to see
where she goes?

25:04.337 --> 25:06.839
Oh.
What if she’s hanging out
with her boyfriend?

25:10.468 --> 25:11.719
Oh, no.

25:11.802 --> 25:13.387
I’m not gonna
stalk her.

25:21.812 --> 25:24.065
-

26:30.631 --> 26:32.091
Maybe I was looking
for you.

26:32.174 --> 26:35.511
Clearly, I wasn’t
going to see you.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.972
It just felt strange,

26:38.055 --> 26:41.350
wanting to tell you...

27:41.077 --> 27:43.829
-

27:43.913 --> 27:46.082
Would you be down
to talk over maybe

27:46.165 --> 27:49.001
some theme ideas
or something?
Whatever you pick is fine.

27:50.836 --> 27:51.962
Okay.

27:54.006 --> 27:57.635
Should we just, like...
I just run my final
selections by you then, or--

27:57.718 --> 27:59.678
I mean, it really
doesn’t matter to me.

27:59.762 --> 28:01.639
I just got
a new feature
in from Jade,

28:01.722 --> 28:03.474
so I was just
gonna edit that.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.269
Oh.

28:22.243 --> 28:26.414
I’d like to match those,
but instead I will
match this.

28:26.497 --> 28:28.124
Hey, Dad,
can I use the car?

28:28.207 --> 28:30.334
Uh, sure, sure.
Where to?

28:33.462 --> 28:34.880
I don’t know.
Nowhere, really.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.216
So, where are you
going?

28:37.299 --> 28:39.510
It’s not
a cross-examination.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.720
I mean, it feels
like that.

28:41.804 --> 28:44.140
Well, you’re asking us
to lend you our car,

28:44.223 --> 28:46.142
and we’re asking
a simple question
in return.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.645
Okay, um, I’m just--
I don’t know.
I’m just gonna go to Muz’s.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.939
Now can I have the keys?
You’re not even using it.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.525
You’re entitled
to your privacy.

28:54.608 --> 28:57.236
If you don’t want us
to know something,
say so.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.196
But don’t insult us
with a lie.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.657
It’s beneath you.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.325
Just-- You can Uber.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.411
What? I can’t Uber.
I don’t have
a credit card.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.955
Well, then you’re
gonna have to walk.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.690
Hi.
Hey.
What’s up?

30:57.773 --> 30:59.525
So,
I couldn’t sleep
last night,

30:59.608 --> 31:01.735
so I was searching
through Mrs. Klein’s
syllabus,

31:01.819 --> 31:06.198
and I noticed
a very interesting
trend.

31:09.118 --> 31:10.619
Uh...

31:13.247 --> 31:14.373
Look at them.
Okay.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.919
Um, yeah.

31:19.003 --> 31:21.589
They’re, um,
all about young people?

31:21.672 --> 31:24.049
And they all
involve suicide.

31:24.133 --> 31:26.468
Romeo and Juliet
off themselves.

31:26.552 --> 31:27.761
Werther
shoots himself.

31:27.845 --> 31:29.597
Holden contemplates
suicide.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.516
Conrad tries
to kill himself
by slashing his wrists.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.520
This is what
you were up thinking
about last night?

31:36.604 --> 31:37.896
Yeah.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.567
Is that normal?
Oh, Jesus.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.861
What?
Well, I...

31:43.944 --> 31:45.237
You...

31:46.447 --> 31:49.950
You, uh, like,
seemed down this week,

31:50.034 --> 31:52.661
so that’s a little
scary, I guess.
Okay.

31:54.788 --> 31:56.373
How do I
explain this?

31:56.457 --> 31:58.917
Um... okay.

31:59.001 --> 32:02.838
Think about what it means
to be a teenager. Okay?

32:02.921 --> 32:05.716
Your parents
pressure you to succeed.

32:05.799 --> 32:09.678
Your friends
pressure you to do shit
you don’t want to do.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.805
Social media
pressures you
to hate your body.

32:11.889 --> 32:16.352
It’s hard, even if you’re
a well-adjusted kid
from a good family.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.686
Okay.

32:17.770 --> 32:20.773
So, now imagine you can’t be
with the person that you love,

32:20.856 --> 32:23.150
like Romeo and Juliet
or Werther,

32:23.233 --> 32:25.152
or you lose the person
that you love,

32:25.235 --> 32:27.154
like Holden or Conrad.

32:27.237 --> 32:29.990
There’s a reason why,
when every author,

32:30.074 --> 32:33.202
from Shakespeare to Salinger,
writes about young people,

32:33.285 --> 32:37.039
they can’t avoid
the truth, that...

32:37.122 --> 32:40.334
being young
is so painful,

32:40.417 --> 32:44.630
it’s almost, like,
too much to feel.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.716
Yeah, are you, like...

32:49.468 --> 32:50.678
suicidal or...

32:50.761 --> 32:52.846
No. God.
I mean...

32:53.972 --> 32:55.891
Look, I’m not gonna
kill myself.

32:55.974 --> 33:01.271
But have I thought about
what it would be like
to just not be here anymore?

33:01.355 --> 33:02.606
Yeah.

33:02.690 --> 33:06.318
And I don’t
say that casually,
but I do say it

33:06.402 --> 33:11.407
because hiding that shit
and not saying it
makes it worse.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.533
It should be talked about.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.618
All of our shit
should be talked about.

33:14.702 --> 33:15.786
Mmm.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.999
The teenage years are...
limbo.

33:21.083 --> 33:25.045
You’re somewhere between
being a kid and an adult,

33:25.129 --> 33:28.465
and the world, uh,
tells you to be mature

33:28.549 --> 33:30.718
and express yourself,
but the minute that you do,

33:30.801 --> 33:32.052
it tells you to shut up.

33:33.554 --> 33:37.433
The thing is,
adults are just scarred kids
who were lucky enough

33:37.516 --> 33:40.102
to make it
out of limbo alive.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.520
Which is why...

33:43.188 --> 33:47.776
the theme of our last issue
should be "Teenage Limbo."

33:51.113 --> 33:52.531
Yeah.

33:54.491 --> 33:57.369
- Henry’s sister is studying
to become a neurosurgeon,

33:57.453 --> 34:01.290
and she explained
that the teenage brain
goes through an upgrade

34:01.373 --> 34:05.002
before it matures
to an adult brain.

34:05.085 --> 34:10.424
So, the upgrade
is like an explosion
of connections and synapses

34:10.507 --> 34:11.842
as we figure out
what’s right.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.053
Or wrong.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.055
What we like,
what we don’t like.

34:17.139 --> 34:19.183
You know,
who we want to be.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.185
-Each page of the issue

34:21.268 --> 34:25.314
is the brain
refining itself,
figuring itself out,

34:25.397 --> 34:29.693
until eventually
it’s out of limbo.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.737
So dope.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.490
Yeah.
Dope.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.784
All right.
Sweet.

34:36.867 --> 34:41.997
Um... so I think
we could kind of just

34:42.080 --> 34:46.084
start a--
kind of a discussion, like
what are we confused about,

34:46.168 --> 34:48.670
what, uh,
maybe scares us.

34:48.754 --> 34:52.132
Um, like,
are there things maybe

34:52.216 --> 34:54.176
you keep inside
that you’re afraid to...

34:55.302 --> 34:56.595
Um...

34:58.514 --> 35:00.349
Do you have
something?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.519
Um...

35:05.229 --> 35:08.482
Well, yeah,
I mean, I do,
but I was gonna...

35:08.565 --> 35:11.735
I think
I was gonna write it,
uh, which...

35:11.819 --> 35:13.153
Hmm.

35:14.530 --> 35:17.199
Um...

35:23.580 --> 35:26.583
Uh, when Mike Johnson
killed himself
a couple years ago,

35:26.667 --> 35:27.751
um...

35:28.919 --> 35:31.755
I realized that
I still had, um, this...

35:33.257 --> 35:36.009
Hustler magazine
that he gave me
when we were, like, 13

35:36.093 --> 35:38.929
that, uh, he stole from
his dad’s collection.

35:39.012 --> 35:40.430
And, um...

35:43.809 --> 35:44.977
I don’t know.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.646
I feel really stupid
admitting this,

35:47.729 --> 35:51.400
but, um, kind of
freaked me out.

35:51.483 --> 35:54.486
Like, I couldn’t really
sleep at night

35:54.570 --> 35:57.573
with this magazine
in my drawer.

35:57.656 --> 36:01.368
Um, like it was just
kind of...

36:01.451 --> 36:04.037
like,
haunted or something.

36:04.121 --> 36:05.581
Um...

36:07.499 --> 36:11.670
And basically, it just
was kind of too important
to throw away,

36:11.753 --> 36:13.547
but it was also
too weird to keep,

36:13.630 --> 36:19.428
so I went to the tree
by the art park,

36:19.511 --> 36:24.474
one where he,
uh, hung himself,

36:24.558 --> 36:29.730
and I, um,
just buried it there.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.359
And, um...

36:36.403 --> 36:38.322
Yeah. Um...

36:39.823 --> 36:42.284
I don’t know.
It was weird,
’cause for the first time,

36:42.367 --> 36:45.412
I was old enough
to understand
the gravity of death,

36:45.495 --> 36:49.750
but I was also, um,
you know, young enough

36:49.833 --> 36:53.837
that it all came down
to just a stupid,
like, porn magazine.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.847
I’m proud of you
for sharing that.

37:03.931 --> 37:06.683
It must have been
hard for you.

37:06.767 --> 37:08.393
Thanks.

37:08.477 --> 37:09.978
Hey, why’d you
give up writing?

37:10.062 --> 37:12.230
You’ve obviously
got a lot of ideas.

37:13.565 --> 37:18.111
Somebody really important
to me... died.

37:19.404 --> 37:20.697
And, um...

37:22.032 --> 37:25.285
and I was asked
to write something,
to say something,

37:25.369 --> 37:29.623
like a eulogy,
because everyone knew
that I was the writer,

37:29.706 --> 37:34.086
and, you know,
told me how beautiful
my words were, but...

37:37.547 --> 37:41.677
Nothing came.
I just couldn’t
find the words.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.600
What?

37:48.684 --> 37:50.936
Uh, oh, no,
it’s just funny.

37:51.019 --> 37:54.314
Um, ’cause, you know,
I can’t find the words
when I talk,

37:54.398 --> 37:57.484
and you can’t
find the words
when you write.

37:57.567 --> 38:00.195
That just
made me laugh.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.447
You know what I mean?

38:11.581 --> 38:15.293
Thank you, anyways.
Yeah, yeah.
I feel like it’s...

38:15.377 --> 38:18.296
You don’t
have to drink it.
It’s not that I don’t want it.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.298
Yeah, sure...
Yeah.

38:25.262 --> 38:27.180
You want to see
a movie this weekend?

38:27.264 --> 38:29.141
I don’t think I can.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.019
You got other plans?

38:32.102 --> 38:35.105
No, I just have
a ton of stuff to do.

38:37.357 --> 38:39.026
So, you used to run track?

38:39.109 --> 38:41.278
Yeah, I was a sprinter.

38:41.361 --> 38:44.614
Oh, what else did you do
in your previous life?

38:44.698 --> 38:46.033
Oh, God.

38:46.116 --> 38:50.370
Lit magazine, yearbook staff,
student government...

38:50.454 --> 38:52.372
beer pong champion.

38:55.125 --> 38:58.587
Um, first football game
is Friday night,
if you want to go.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.255
Not that I care,
but it’s fun.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.883
We usually pregame,
and everyone goes.

39:02.966 --> 39:05.385
That sounds fun, but I can’t.

39:05.469 --> 39:06.803
Another time though.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.558
What would you say is the
dumbest thing you’ve ever done?

39:11.641 --> 39:13.518
Um, probably
when I put my finger

39:13.602 --> 39:15.729
in an electric pencil sharpener
in first grade.

39:15.812 --> 39:18.231
It didn’t go, um, super well.

39:18.315 --> 39:21.109
What did
you think was gonna happen?

39:21.193 --> 39:23.403
I guess I thought
it would trim my fingernail.

39:26.990 --> 39:31.078
That we bleed the same?

39:35.665 --> 39:37.501
I used to be good
at socializing.

39:37.584 --> 39:39.628
I mean, I used to do it
all the time.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.129
What changed?

39:41.213 --> 39:44.132
I guess
I stopped seeing the point.

39:44.216 --> 39:48.136
Sometimes it’s just easier
to slip into your own dark abyss

39:48.220 --> 39:50.555
and forget the world exists.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.309
Yeah, I see her
in you sometimes,

39:54.392 --> 39:58.605
like, these, um,
flashes of this girl
that you used to be.

39:58.688 --> 40:01.858
Um, but was she an act
and you’re more yourself now,

40:01.942 --> 40:04.027
or is the Grace
that I know an act

40:04.111 --> 40:06.947
until you feel comfortable
being yourself again?

40:08.573 --> 40:10.867
I don’t know. People change.

40:10.951 --> 40:14.955
There’s no way you’re
the same person you were
when you were 14.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.510
Hey, um...

40:30.137 --> 40:31.138
What?

40:33.598 --> 40:37.102
All right, so Heslin is having
his annual Halloween party
tomorrow night.

40:37.185 --> 40:39.229
And it doesn’t
have to be a big thing.

40:39.312 --> 40:41.189
Doesn’t have to be
a date or whatever.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.816
No, that’s not why.

40:42.899 --> 40:44.317
I think it could...
That’s not why.

40:44.401 --> 40:47.779
...maybe be,
um, just fun.

40:47.863 --> 40:50.615
It’d be good to--
good for you,

40:50.699 --> 40:55.537
kind of get back
to doing old Grace
things. Um...

40:55.620 --> 41:01.376
Oh, is the new Grace
not good enough
for you or...

41:01.459 --> 41:04.629
No. No, no.
That’s not what I meant.

41:04.713 --> 41:07.257
Um, no.
I think, um...

41:07.340 --> 41:09.634
Hey, hey.

41:09.718 --> 41:11.469
Let’s go.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.308
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.111
Your keys.

41:29.613 --> 41:30.906
Can I come in?

41:33.742 --> 41:35.243
You don’t have
to go somewhere?

41:36.411 --> 41:41.249
No, I’m not going
to where I go today,
so...

41:44.169 --> 41:45.378
Okay, yeah.
No, totally.
Yeah?

41:45.462 --> 41:47.589
Yeah, come in.

41:52.385 --> 41:53.720
Give me two.

41:53.803 --> 41:57.015
I’ll take three.
But you get three
first. Here.

41:57.098 --> 41:58.600
Hey, guys.
What’s up?
Hey, Henry.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.101
Hey.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.103
Join us, bud.
Uh,
can’t right now.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.105
But this is Grace.

42:06.608 --> 42:08.318
Hi!

42:08.401 --> 42:09.986
Oh.
It’s Grace!

42:10.070 --> 42:11.529
-Yeah.
-Yeah. You actually came in.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.198
We’ve only seen
your car up until now.

42:24.334 --> 42:27.212
Just gonna pick up
this stuff here.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.275
-

42:57.993 --> 42:59.452
How did this break?

43:01.329 --> 43:02.872
Oh, um...

43:02.956 --> 43:05.166
I broke that,
actually.

43:06.126 --> 43:08.044
Uh, it’s called
Kintsukuroi.

43:08.128 --> 43:11.298
It’s kind of this
old-school Japanese
art form

43:11.381 --> 43:14.301
where you mend back
broken pottery
with seams of gold.

43:55.592 --> 43:58.053
Wait, uh,
is this...

43:59.763 --> 44:02.307
Oh, it’s the song
that you like to play
in your car.

44:05.477 --> 44:06.478
Are you okay?

44:09.314 --> 44:11.483
Why are you--
why are you
playing this?

44:11.566 --> 44:13.902
I mean, I don’t know.
I like it. I...

44:13.985 --> 44:16.237
Kind of reminds me
of us, I guess.

44:31.544 --> 44:33.004
Hey. Hey.

44:33.088 --> 44:34.798
I’m sorry
I played that.
I didn’t know.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.424
I thought...
I don’t know.

44:36.508 --> 44:38.718
We listen to it
all the time
in the car together.

44:38.802 --> 44:40.762
Okay, but it’s not
our song, okay?

44:40.845 --> 44:42.347
Okay.
It’s not for you
and me.

44:42.430 --> 44:44.224
Okay.
Who’s it for?
What is it?

44:44.307 --> 44:46.434
Dom.

44:46.518 --> 44:49.062
He was my boyfriend.

44:49.145 --> 44:52.941
He was driving the car,
and I fucked up my knee,
but he...

44:53.024 --> 44:56.277
Oh. I’m sorry.
I didn’t...

44:59.197 --> 45:01.199
I understand if you don’t
want to, like--

45:01.282 --> 45:03.076
if you don’t want to do
anything with me--

45:18.466 --> 45:19.843
Hey.

45:19.926 --> 45:21.845
Can you let me
drive you home?
No, please.

45:21.928 --> 45:23.555
Please stop,
Henry.
Why?

45:23.638 --> 45:25.932
Because I’m fucked up,
okay?
Come on. What’s wrong?

45:26.015 --> 45:28.226
Can I drive you
home?
Yes. No. Please.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.019
Please?
Come on. Why?
No.

45:30.103 --> 45:31.980
I’m messed up.
It’s okay.
I don’t care.

45:32.063 --> 45:34.107
No, it’s not!

45:34.190 --> 45:37.819
It’s not when you realize
that I’m not one of
your fucking vases, okay?

46:08.600 --> 46:10.351
You guys think
this needs to be here?

46:10.435 --> 46:11.686
No.
- You’re right.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.313
I don’t feel like
we needed it anyway.

46:13.396 --> 46:14.898
It doesn’t
make sense.
Seriously?

46:14.981 --> 46:18.026
Hey, guys.
Are you going
to Heslin’s tonight?

46:18.109 --> 46:20.111
Yeah.
Maybe.

46:20.195 --> 46:22.155
We might
come through.
Cool.

46:22.238 --> 46:23.948
Well, I hope you do.

46:24.032 --> 46:25.033
Hmm.

46:28.369 --> 46:30.121
What time is Elks
picking us up?

46:31.122 --> 46:33.541
Um, I do not know.
I’m not going, so...

46:33.625 --> 46:36.336
No. No, no, no.
No, we’re going.

46:36.419 --> 46:39.547
A little beautiful creature,
who might be a part of
the fairy kingdom like myself,

46:39.631 --> 46:42.091
just invited me
to her magical,
enchanted forest.

46:42.175 --> 46:45.178
And I’m gonna take
this opportunity
to fly.

46:45.261 --> 46:46.804
Meh.

46:46.888 --> 46:48.848
"Meh" yourself.

46:48.932 --> 46:50.975
Don’t dip out
’cause of that chick.

46:51.059 --> 46:52.060
What?

46:52.143 --> 46:54.646
I need you there
for moral support.

46:54.729 --> 46:57.357
No, it’s not ’cause of her.
I’m not feeling well,
that’s all.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.859
Oh, my God.
Wow.

46:59.943 --> 47:02.237
Elks has Kush.

47:04.572 --> 47:06.533
What kind of Kush?

47:06.616 --> 47:08.868
-

47:16.584 --> 47:19.212
Take it easy, bro.
Easy in, easy out.

47:19.295 --> 47:21.548
It’s a marathon,
not a sprint.

47:23.132 --> 47:25.260
Yeah, I know.

47:25.343 --> 47:27.428
Hey.
What’s up?

47:27.512 --> 47:30.723
She’s already talking
to someone else.

47:30.807 --> 47:35.019
Man, I knew I shouldn’t have
gotten my hopes up.
Man, she’s just playing me.

47:35.103 --> 47:36.854
Go.

47:36.938 --> 47:39.065
Go. Go.
I need to ease
into it, bro.

47:39.148 --> 47:40.149
Why?

47:40.233 --> 47:41.985
Henry Page.

47:42.068 --> 47:44.988
I cannot.
I can’t.

47:45.071 --> 47:46.406
Bye, Henry.

47:46.489 --> 47:48.533
...comes sprinting in,
his hands are over his face,

47:48.616 --> 47:51.286
and he just pukes.
He just pukes
everywhere.

47:51.369 --> 47:52.537
No one knew what to do.

47:52.620 --> 47:54.414
It was between this
tiny little crevice

47:54.497 --> 47:55.832
between the wall
and the fridge--

47:55.915 --> 47:57.875
I’m just gonna
get some water.
What?

47:57.959 --> 47:59.419
I’m just gonna
get some water.

47:59.502 --> 48:01.462
Are you okay?
Yeah, I’m good.

48:22.609 --> 48:24.861
-

48:46.966 --> 48:48.343
Got you this.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.428
Thank you.
Yeah.

48:54.641 --> 48:56.517
What?

48:57.727 --> 48:59.646
You look, um...

49:00.897 --> 49:02.398
Thotty?

49:02.482 --> 49:05.026
I was gonna say hot.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.907
Well, it’s my costume
from last year.

49:13.534 --> 49:15.078
Are you doing okay?

49:17.163 --> 49:21.042
Yeah.
In this moment,
I’m... I’m okay.

49:23.127 --> 49:25.338
I think you’re
the most confusing
human being

49:25.421 --> 49:27.799
I’ve ever met.

49:27.882 --> 49:31.803
And I think
I’m just the most
confused human being

49:31.886 --> 49:34.514
you’ve ever met
and that confuses you.

49:36.516 --> 49:38.184
Yeah, well...

49:40.061 --> 49:43.189
I’m, uh,
pretty trashed
right now,

49:43.272 --> 49:46.567
so I guess I’m even
more confused.

49:54.325 --> 49:57.578
Down, down, down...

49:57.662 --> 49:59.414
Hey, I’ve been
looking for you.

49:59.497 --> 50:01.874
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

50:02.959 --> 50:05.211
Uh, so last year,
I, uh...

50:05.294 --> 50:06.879
I get it.

50:06.963 --> 50:09.465
It was weird.

50:09.549 --> 50:11.592
We can just be friends.

50:12.844 --> 50:14.178
Cool.

50:17.473 --> 50:19.684
I hooked up
with a lot of girls
last summer.

50:19.767 --> 50:22.729
Okay.

50:22.812 --> 50:26.607
Yeah, uh, I was just
really confused after we...

50:27.984 --> 50:29.068
you know.

50:29.152 --> 50:31.696
I know.
I don’t know.

50:31.779 --> 50:34.824
I tried to, uh,
figure that out, I guess.

50:34.907 --> 50:36.492
But...

50:36.576 --> 50:40.413
I realized that
I didn’t feel anything
for any of them.

50:40.496 --> 50:44.792
I don’t necessarily
know how to, um,
label myself, but...

50:46.753 --> 50:49.172
I know what I feel
when you’re in front of me.

50:50.506 --> 50:53.259
It’s like, uh,
we are--

50:53.342 --> 50:56.053
or, uh, we be.

50:57.930 --> 51:00.433
Then let’s just be.

51:07.356 --> 51:09.692
Of your heart

51:11.736 --> 51:15.448
Down, down, down...

51:23.039 --> 51:25.541
On you, baby

51:27.043 --> 51:31.380
And make it rain so well

51:32.632 --> 51:34.217
Oh, no.

51:34.300 --> 51:35.718
I can’t dance.
No.

51:37.136 --> 51:38.679
’Bout it, ’bout it

51:38.763 --> 51:41.641
On you, baby

51:43.142 --> 51:47.313
And make it rain so well

51:47.396 --> 51:49.273
My pinky ring

51:55.655 --> 51:57.657
-

52:00.034 --> 52:01.661
-

52:03.246 --> 52:05.706
-

52:07.750 --> 52:09.794
-

52:11.629 --> 52:13.339
Looking at me

52:24.684 --> 52:27.103
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

53:15.109 --> 53:17.236
I hope you don’t have
high expectations...

53:18.779 --> 53:21.407
’cause I’m probably
pretty rusty.

53:23.326 --> 53:26.454
Well, I hope you don’t have
high expectations either,

53:26.537 --> 53:29.957
’cause I’ve never
done this before.

53:32.335 --> 53:34.170
Do you have a condom?

53:34.253 --> 53:35.671
Yeah.
Yeah.

53:36.589 --> 53:37.757
I should get it?
Get it.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.133
Get it, okay.

54:06.744 --> 54:08.663
Oh. Oh, God.

54:08.746 --> 54:10.915
Let me do it.
Okay.

54:10.998 --> 54:12.750
I’m sorry. I laugh
when I’m nervous.

54:12.833 --> 54:16.295
Do you want me
to do it?
Yeah. Sure.

54:35.481 --> 54:37.692
Henry, Henry,
Henry, Henry.
Yeah?

54:39.026 --> 54:40.778
Don’t try to be
good at it, okay?

54:40.861 --> 54:43.239
Just be here with me.

54:44.448 --> 54:45.658
Okay.

55:33.456 --> 55:35.624
Leave your message.
-

55:35.708 --> 55:38.252
Um, hey, Grace.
Um, just want to say hi,

55:38.335 --> 55:40.588
and that, um...

55:41.672 --> 55:43.424
you know, despite
my lack of experience,

55:43.507 --> 55:46.302
um, hope that,
uh, last night
just kind of meant

55:46.385 --> 55:49.930
a tiny fraction to you
as it meant to me.

55:50.014 --> 55:52.808
And, yeah, um...

55:52.892 --> 55:56.187
Then also, I promise
if we ever get the chance
to do it again, um--

55:56.270 --> 55:57.730
I mean,
’cause not that--

55:57.813 --> 55:59.940
I’m not presumptuous enough
to think that we will,

56:00.024 --> 56:02.401
but, like, if we do,
then, uh, you know,

56:02.485 --> 56:03.986
I promise
that it’ll be better.

56:04.070 --> 56:07.114
Uh, no,
that I’ll be better.

56:07.198 --> 56:09.950
Um, ’cause, uh, you know,

56:10.034 --> 56:12.953
um, practice does
make, uh, perfect.

56:13.037 --> 56:15.456
So, uh, yeah.

56:15.539 --> 56:16.832
Bye-bye.

56:17.958 --> 56:20.044
Oh, fuck,
that was dumb.

57:14.849 --> 57:16.767
What?

57:16.851 --> 57:18.936
Surprise.
How did this happen?

57:20.563 --> 57:22.356
It was just time.

57:23.774 --> 57:25.192
Shit. All right.

57:25.276 --> 57:27.653
Um, where are we going?

57:28.904 --> 57:30.322
You’ll see.

57:39.206 --> 57:43.169
It’s a Saturn world

57:46.755 --> 57:50.885
We don’t have a long time

57:57.224 --> 58:00.436
Are set in their ways

58:04.273 --> 58:08.360
We don’t have a long time

58:34.470 --> 58:37.556
We used to come here
all the time
before he died.

58:40.100 --> 58:41.769
I loved this drive.

58:41.852 --> 58:44.271
I want to be able
to love it again.

58:49.902 --> 58:52.863
I needed you here.

58:54.198 --> 58:56.116
I needed your support.

59:07.544 --> 59:08.921
Hold this.

59:20.057 --> 59:22.434
Is this
from the factory?

59:22.518 --> 59:24.436
What does it mean?

59:24.520 --> 59:26.897
"Save me,
and I will save you."

59:29.483 --> 59:31.110
That was us.

59:47.876 --> 59:49.795
I want to move on.

1:00:09.148 --> 1:00:11.650
I’m telling you,
Sharma...

1:00:11.734 --> 1:00:14.153
...dropped his glasses
right into the toilet.

1:00:14.236 --> 1:00:16.196
He nearly flushed
them down there.

1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:19.033
But he fished them out,
’cause he got
the same glasses on.

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:23.370
No, I sw--
I...

1:00:24.663 --> 1:00:26.290
Can I join you guys?

1:00:33.297 --> 1:00:34.631
Okay.
Okay, got it?

1:00:34.715 --> 1:00:36.467
Yeah, that was
very helpful.
Okay, good.

1:00:36.550 --> 1:00:37.926
Thank you.
You’re welcome.

1:00:38.010 --> 1:00:40.304
Hey, with all the news
that’s fit to print,

1:00:40.387 --> 1:00:41.680
your first issue!

1:00:41.764 --> 1:00:44.391
Congratulations!

1:00:47.478 --> 1:00:48.771
Well...
Hmm. Yeah.

1:00:52.733 --> 1:00:55.444
Tonight

1:00:58.155 --> 1:01:01.825
Tonight

1:01:08.791 --> 1:01:10.292
Stay here.

1:01:12.878 --> 1:01:15.464
Whose car is that?
Stay here, Henry.

1:01:20.844 --> 1:01:22.554
Aren’t you supposed
to remember that?

1:01:22.638 --> 1:01:23.972
No, I don’t
remember that!

1:01:24.056 --> 1:01:26.850
I don’t want--
No, no. Go! Go!

1:01:54.753 --> 1:01:55.796
Hey.

1:01:58.632 --> 1:02:00.050
That your mom?

1:02:01.343 --> 1:02:03.220
No.

1:02:03.303 --> 1:02:06.432
Yeah.
It doesn’t... matter.

1:02:06.515 --> 1:02:08.434
You all right?

1:02:08.517 --> 1:02:10.144
I’m fine.
Can we go?

1:02:26.076 --> 1:02:28.078
So do you live
with your dad?

1:02:29.663 --> 1:02:31.081
I mean,

1:02:31.165 --> 1:02:33.333
I just feel like
I don’t know anything
about your family.

1:02:33.417 --> 1:02:36.003
Well, yeah.
Well, okay,
you know enough.

1:02:38.255 --> 1:02:39.631
Something obviously
just happened,

1:02:39.715 --> 1:02:41.467
so I don’t know how
I’m supposed to help you--

1:02:41.550 --> 1:02:42.843
You don’t.
You don’t help me.

1:02:42.926 --> 1:02:44.928
I didn’t ask for your help,
so stop trying to help me.

1:02:45.012 --> 1:02:46.930
Stop trying to fix me,
all right?

1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:04.531
Oh, look at this.

1:03:04.615 --> 1:03:07.117
It’s a lollygagging
convention in here.

1:03:07.201 --> 1:03:08.243
Let’s go, people.

1:03:08.327 --> 1:03:09.703
We have three more
issues to plan.

1:03:09.786 --> 1:03:12.080
I’d love to see
a little focus, please.

1:03:12.164 --> 1:03:14.833
Henry, where’s
your partner in crime?

1:03:15.834 --> 1:03:17.544
I don’t know.

1:03:17.628 --> 1:03:18.962
She sick?

1:03:20.589 --> 1:03:21.924
I don’t know.

1:03:23.008 --> 1:03:25.260
Today’s the anniversary
of her accident.

1:03:25.344 --> 1:03:28.222
Oh, dear. I, um...
I didn’t know that.

1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:33.477
Yeah. East River
had a candlelight vigil
for her boyfriend.

1:03:34.645 --> 1:03:36.230
-

1:03:36.313 --> 1:03:38.398
Does she drive?
Does she have her license?

1:03:38.482 --> 1:03:40.567
Should we be...

1:03:40.651 --> 1:03:42.903
You’re probably
right about that.

1:03:44.029 --> 1:03:45.948
Leave your message.
-

1:03:46.031 --> 1:03:47.616
I would think so.
Would you?

1:03:47.699 --> 1:03:48.575
Yeah.

1:03:48.659 --> 1:03:49.868
I don’t know.
Muck around.

1:03:49.952 --> 1:03:51.578
Muck around
a little more.
Muck.

1:03:51.662 --> 1:03:53.705
What? Stop it.
No. Ow.

1:03:53.789 --> 1:03:55.958
Stop.
Muck around.

1:03:58.544 --> 1:04:00.379
Hankard. Hankard.
Yo, where you going?

1:04:26.238 --> 1:04:28.407
Henry?

1:04:28.490 --> 1:04:29.491
That you?

1:04:29.575 --> 1:04:31.451
Yeah.

1:04:31.535 --> 1:04:32.995
Come on in.

1:04:36.707 --> 1:04:39.209
I must have fallen asleep
in front of the tube.

1:04:41.128 --> 1:04:43.088
I’m Martin, by the way.

1:04:44.631 --> 1:04:45.799
Oh.

1:04:47.259 --> 1:04:49.428
This is my wife Sarah.

1:04:49.511 --> 1:04:51.346
Hi.
Hello.

1:04:55.183 --> 1:04:58.103
Grace has talked
a lot about you.

1:04:58.186 --> 1:04:59.730
Says you’ve been
a good friend.

1:04:59.813 --> 1:05:03.025
Yeah, I just wanted
to make sure
that she was okay,

1:05:03.108 --> 1:05:04.818
’cause I didn’t
talk to her today.

1:05:04.901 --> 1:05:06.695
Um, and, you know,

1:05:06.778 --> 1:05:09.823
given what day it is,
I... I, uh...

1:05:11.283 --> 1:05:15.454
Well, she should be home
pretty soon.

1:05:15.537 --> 1:05:17.497
You can wait upstairs
if you want.

1:05:19.541 --> 1:05:22.961
Um, well, thank you.
It was good meeting
you guys.

1:05:23.045 --> 1:05:25.255
Yeah.
Nice meeting you, Henry.
Yeah.

1:06:29.444 --> 1:06:31.029
So now you know.

1:06:35.617 --> 1:06:38.662
Do you live here?
Yeah.

1:06:40.747 --> 1:06:44.751
I moved in a month
before the accident
to get away from my mom.

1:06:44.835 --> 1:06:49.423
She was drinking a lot,
and she was in really
bad shape.

1:06:49.506 --> 1:06:50.924
But you’re still here.

1:06:51.007 --> 1:06:55.262
Where else was
I supposed to go,
my mom’s boyfriend’s couch?

1:07:02.310 --> 1:07:03.854
You went back for that?

1:07:16.658 --> 1:07:18.076
Do you even
wash his clothes?

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:20.620
’Cause you wear
his clothes, right?

1:07:21.913 --> 1:07:23.874
I’m doing the best
that I can.

1:07:23.957 --> 1:07:26.752
You’re doing the best
you can, but you’re living
in his fucking room?

1:07:28.295 --> 1:07:30.297
We grew up together.

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:34.176
He was...
he was my family.

1:07:36.261 --> 1:07:38.263
I’m not asking you
to let him go.

1:07:39.639 --> 1:07:42.434
I’m giving you
all that I can.

1:07:42.517 --> 1:07:46.104
And this... confusion
and this craziness

1:07:46.188 --> 1:07:47.397
is what that looks like.

1:07:47.481 --> 1:07:51.067
And you can’t handle it,
but I never expected you to.

1:07:52.194 --> 1:07:54.780
What else could I
possibly give you?

1:07:55.864 --> 1:07:57.365
What else can you give me?

1:07:57.449 --> 1:07:59.701
Are you fucking...

1:07:59.785 --> 1:08:01.578
Oh, this is crazy.
This is crazy.

1:08:01.661 --> 1:08:03.121
Just stop.
No, you stop!

1:08:03.205 --> 1:08:04.706
Stop leading me on!
I just--

1:08:04.790 --> 1:08:07.167
I didn’t start dating you
out of nowhere or something.

1:08:09.294 --> 1:08:10.796
I told you
to leave me alone.

1:08:10.879 --> 1:08:12.964
Yeah, but then
you told me not to.

1:08:14.591 --> 1:08:15.759
Well, because I don’t know.

1:08:15.842 --> 1:08:16.843
Because I don’t know.

1:08:16.927 --> 1:08:17.928
I know.
I don’t know.

1:08:18.011 --> 1:08:19.137
I’m confused, Henry.

1:08:19.221 --> 1:08:20.847
I don’t know.
I know!

1:08:20.931 --> 1:08:24.434
I’ve known since, like,
the very beginning
that I love you.

1:08:26.770 --> 1:08:29.356
I can’t pretend
to be better because
that’s what you want.

1:08:29.439 --> 1:08:31.775
You said you wanted
to get better.
I do.

1:08:34.361 --> 1:08:36.154
I’m not ready yet.
I’m not--

1:08:36.238 --> 1:08:37.614
I do, but I’m not
ready yet.

1:08:37.697 --> 1:08:38.990
Well, I...

1:08:40.951 --> 1:08:43.078
I don’t care.
All right?

1:08:44.496 --> 1:08:45.997
Yes, you do.
I...
No, I don’t.

1:08:46.081 --> 1:08:47.666
I don’t care.

1:08:47.749 --> 1:08:50.377
Seriously, I want you
exactly the way you are.

1:08:52.963 --> 1:08:55.590
But you just got to
let me in and talk to me.

1:08:57.342 --> 1:08:58.760
I love you.

1:09:11.606 --> 1:09:14.025
-

1:09:25.370 --> 1:09:27.455
Why do you kiss me
like that?

1:09:30.041 --> 1:09:31.418
Like what?

1:09:34.921 --> 1:09:37.007
Like you’re in love
with me.

1:09:40.802 --> 1:09:43.221
It’s the only way
I know how.

1:10:32.062 --> 1:10:34.606
-

1:10:34.689 --> 1:10:36.274
Plate’s for you
in the oven, toots.

1:10:36.358 --> 1:10:38.401
Henry?
-What?

1:10:40.195 --> 1:10:42.614
What’s wrong?
Nothing.

1:10:43.782 --> 1:10:45.784
What’s wrong?
Nothing.

1:10:45.867 --> 1:10:47.494
Come here.
Come on.

1:10:47.577 --> 1:10:50.997
We just want to know
what’s going on.

1:10:51.081 --> 1:10:52.540
Is it Grace?

1:10:52.624 --> 1:10:54.626
It’s just regular shit
that regular people
go through

1:10:54.709 --> 1:10:56.002
that you are not
gonna understand.

1:10:56.086 --> 1:10:58.213
Oh, come on.
We’re not
regular people?

1:11:00.966 --> 1:11:03.510
No. No. Are you
fucking kidding me?

1:11:03.593 --> 1:11:05.804
Your relationship’s
been perfect
since you were my age.

1:11:09.224 --> 1:11:10.725
I got this.
No, no, no,
no, no.

1:11:10.809 --> 1:11:12.268
We should go.
Mom.

1:11:12.352 --> 1:11:14.771
He’s right.
You don’t understand.

1:11:14.854 --> 1:11:16.231
I got it.

1:11:30.578 --> 1:11:32.539
Did you guys break up?
Yeah.

1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:37.043
I mean, I don’t
even know if we were
actually together.

1:11:37.127 --> 1:11:38.837
Maybe it’s just
a bump in the road.

1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:40.880
No, she doesn’t want me.

1:11:40.964 --> 1:11:42.465
What happened?

1:11:43.717 --> 1:11:47.262
She’s in love
with someone else.

1:11:47.345 --> 1:11:49.139
Oh, shit.

1:11:56.021 --> 1:11:57.272
Okay.

1:12:00.734 --> 1:12:03.194
You want the good news
or the bad news?

1:12:03.278 --> 1:12:04.279
Neither.

1:12:04.362 --> 1:12:07.699
Well, the bad news is
it’s gonna hurt.

1:12:07.782 --> 1:12:10.285
Your brain has gotten
used to a steady stream

1:12:10.368 --> 1:12:12.954
of dopamine
and oxytocin.
Here we go again.

1:12:13.038 --> 1:12:15.373
Yeah, I know.
I’m sorry,
but that’s what causes

1:12:15.457 --> 1:12:18.209
all those blissed-out
feelings of love.

1:12:18.293 --> 1:12:21.796
And now it’s replaced
with stress hormones.

1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:24.007
They’re gonna make you
feel like garbage.

1:12:24.090 --> 1:12:28.053
Headaches, tight muscles,
tight chest.

1:12:28.136 --> 1:12:31.097
Your body’s craving
those feel-good chemicals.

1:12:32.557 --> 1:12:34.225
It’s basically withdrawal.

1:12:34.309 --> 1:12:36.019
Oh, awesome.

1:12:36.102 --> 1:12:38.521
Yeah. Yeah.

1:12:43.151 --> 1:12:47.614
Yesterday was the first day
I didn’t think about him.

1:12:50.533 --> 1:12:54.204
And tomorrow
I’m going on my first date.

1:13:01.419 --> 1:13:03.755
Henry.
Hmm?

1:13:05.548 --> 1:13:09.719
Love--
it’s a chemical reaction
that comes and goes.

1:13:10.804 --> 1:13:15.183
Here’s the good news:
so is heartbreak.

1:13:15.266 --> 1:13:17.185
Your brain adjusts.

1:13:17.268 --> 1:13:20.647
Your body chemistry
changes back to normal.

1:13:23.441 --> 1:13:24.984
It’s all
a waste of time.

1:13:25.068 --> 1:13:27.237
Oh, no.

1:13:29.114 --> 1:13:30.406
Hey.

1:13:32.700 --> 1:13:35.453
Would you take it
all back if you could?

1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:40.542
You can’t.

1:13:42.544 --> 1:13:44.546
She’s a part of you now.

1:14:43.646 --> 1:14:44.647
Are you trying to...

1:14:44.731 --> 1:14:46.774
Are you gonna copy me
this whole time? Okay.

1:14:46.858 --> 1:14:50.320
No, but I actually have
a real question. Wait.

1:14:50.403 --> 1:14:51.946
You can’t do that.
What’s over there?

1:14:52.030 --> 1:14:53.031
I did it.

1:14:53.114 --> 1:14:54.490
I did it.

1:14:55.783 --> 1:14:57.535
Where you going?

1:14:57.619 --> 1:14:59.454
Um...
I don’t know.

1:14:59.537 --> 1:15:01.623
Just don’t want
to watch this.

1:15:02.916 --> 1:15:04.542
Wow.

1:15:04.626 --> 1:15:06.920
You just can’t be happy
for anybody else.
Boo.

1:15:07.003 --> 1:15:08.880
Don’t even--
don’t do that.

1:15:08.963 --> 1:15:10.131
Don’t do that.

1:15:39.869 --> 1:15:40.870
Whoa.

1:15:43.998 --> 1:15:45.250
Watch it!
-

1:15:45.333 --> 1:15:47.877
Oh!
Whoa, did you see that?

1:16:07.355 --> 1:16:08.356
Grace?

1:16:14.445 --> 1:16:16.155
Are you okay?
I need to--

1:16:16.239 --> 1:16:18.199
-I need to tell you.
-What? What do you need?

1:16:18.283 --> 1:16:19.284
I need to tell you.

1:16:19.367 --> 1:16:22.036
-What?
-I need to say it, Dom.

1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:23.204
I need to say it, Dom.

1:16:23.288 --> 1:16:24.414
Okay, say it.

1:16:24.497 --> 1:16:25.957
It should have been me.

1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:28.167
It should have been me.

1:16:28.251 --> 1:16:29.585
It should have been me.

1:16:29.669 --> 1:16:31.629
No. No.
It should have been me.

1:16:31.713 --> 1:16:33.423
Yes, you fucking
asshole!

1:16:33.506 --> 1:16:35.258
It was my fault!

1:16:35.341 --> 1:16:36.801
No, it wasn’t,
Grace.
Yes, it was.

1:16:36.884 --> 1:16:39.512
-No, it wasn’t.
-You told me to stop
teasing you.

1:16:39.595 --> 1:16:40.596
You told me.

1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:43.266
You told me,
and I didn’t listen.

1:16:43.349 --> 1:16:45.268
I didn’t listen.
It’s okay.

1:16:45.351 --> 1:16:46.936
I just wanted
to make you laugh.

1:16:47.020 --> 1:16:49.480
-It’s okay. It’s okay.
-But you told me to stop.

1:16:49.564 --> 1:16:51.232
Oh, I’m sorry.
It’s all right.

1:16:51.316 --> 1:16:53.943
I’m sorry. I’m sorry!

1:16:54.027 --> 1:16:55.778
It’s okay.
It’s okay.

1:16:58.197 --> 1:16:59.824
It’s okay.

1:17:34.650 --> 1:17:38.404
I felt him swerve.

1:17:40.323 --> 1:17:42.408
And I knew, in that
fraction of a second,

1:17:42.492 --> 1:17:44.327
that we were gonna crash.

1:17:48.915 --> 1:17:53.002
And my last thought
before it happened was,
"Shit."

1:17:56.756 --> 1:18:01.177
The last thought
I was about to have
in my entire life was, "Shit."

1:18:07.475 --> 1:18:08.851
I didn’t think about Dom.

1:18:08.935 --> 1:18:11.604
I didn’t even think
about him.

1:18:14.941 --> 1:18:17.902
Does that make me
a bad person, Henry?

1:18:19.779 --> 1:18:22.532
No.

1:18:22.615 --> 1:18:24.033
Makes you a person.

1:18:26.911 --> 1:18:29.414
I wonder what he was
thinking about.

1:18:30.540 --> 1:18:33.126
I wonder what
his last thought was.

1:18:36.921 --> 1:18:39.257
He was thinking
about you, Grace.

1:18:41.551 --> 1:18:42.844
Guarantee it.

1:20:37.416 --> 1:20:39.919
I was gonna marry him
in that dress.

1:21:30.636 --> 1:21:32.930
No, you keep it.
It’s cold out.

1:22:18.017 --> 1:22:19.477
Quick announcement,
everyone.

1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:21.812
If I might have
everyone’s attention
for a moment, please.

1:22:21.896 --> 1:22:23.939
-Thank you.

1:22:24.023 --> 1:22:27.818
So, I wanted to let you know
that Grace Town has decided

1:22:27.902 --> 1:22:29.403
to take some time
off from school

1:22:29.487 --> 1:22:31.405
to deal with
some personal issues.

1:22:31.489 --> 1:22:35.618
And, um, when she returns,
she’d prefer to focus
on her studies

1:22:35.701 --> 1:22:37.536
rather than
the newspaper.

1:22:37.620 --> 1:22:39.246
I’m sure we’ll all
miss her very much,

1:22:39.330 --> 1:22:40.706
but, uh,
it does sound like

1:22:40.790 --> 1:22:43.542
this is the best decision
for her at this time.

1:22:43.626 --> 1:22:45.711
I know this news
might come
as a disappointment,

1:22:45.795 --> 1:22:48.214
but I want you to know
that I have
the utmost faith

1:22:48.297 --> 1:22:49.423
in this group of people

1:22:49.507 --> 1:22:52.385
to produce three stellar issues.

1:23:01.852 --> 1:23:04.021
- When you’re a teenager,

1:23:04.105 --> 1:23:07.108
the chemicals in your brain
drive you to make decisions

1:23:07.191 --> 1:23:09.985
that rip you away from
the safety of your childhood

1:23:10.069 --> 1:23:13.280
and drag you into
the wilderness of adulthood.

1:23:14.573 --> 1:23:17.034
A friend once told me
that adults are just

1:23:17.118 --> 1:23:18.953
scarred kids
who were lucky enough

1:23:19.036 --> 1:23:21.664
to make it out of
teenage limbo alive.

1:23:22.623 --> 1:23:24.458
I urge you to go outside

1:23:24.542 --> 1:23:27.211
and look at the world
through that prism.

1:23:27.294 --> 1:23:30.923
Look at your parents,
your older siblings.

1:23:31.006 --> 1:23:34.051
Look at strangers
you pass on the street.

1:23:34.135 --> 1:23:38.556
Look at them and imagine that,
at one point in their lives,

1:23:38.639 --> 1:23:40.808
they too walked these halls.

1:23:40.891 --> 1:23:44.228
They too felt
the unbearable loneliness,

1:23:44.311 --> 1:23:47.106
the absolute
unbearable powerlessness

1:23:47.189 --> 1:23:50.651
and darkness of being young.

1:23:50.735 --> 1:23:52.361
Number two!

1:23:54.697 --> 1:23:55.865
This is three.

1:23:58.534 --> 1:24:03.038
We tend to think
of scars as ugly or imperfect...

1:24:06.834 --> 1:24:09.837
as things
we want to hide or forget.

1:24:16.051 --> 1:24:17.887
But they never go away.

1:24:23.768 --> 1:24:25.978
-As I write this,

1:24:26.061 --> 1:24:27.646
my last editorial...

1:24:33.819 --> 1:24:36.238
I finally understand

1:24:36.322 --> 1:24:40.576
that scars are not reminders
of what’s been broken,

1:24:40.659 --> 1:24:44.288
but rather
of what’s been created.

1:25:15.236 --> 1:25:17.988
Hey.
Hey.

1:25:18.072 --> 1:25:19.198
Let’s...

1:25:22.076 --> 1:25:24.662
Congratulations.

1:25:24.745 --> 1:25:25.996
Yeah, you too.

1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:27.873
Thank you.
Yeah.

1:25:30.209 --> 1:25:32.211
Where are you
off to next year?

1:25:32.294 --> 1:25:35.172
I’m gonna go
to Bennington.

1:25:35.256 --> 1:25:36.465
It’s a school
in Vermont.

1:25:36.549 --> 1:25:37.883
It’s good for writing.
Nice.

1:25:37.967 --> 1:25:38.968
What are you doing?

1:25:39.051 --> 1:25:42.471
Uh, I’m taking
a year off.

1:25:43.931 --> 1:25:46.225
Just continuing
therapy.

1:25:47.601 --> 1:25:49.103
Oh.

1:25:51.146 --> 1:25:53.858
Yeah, I was never gonna
be ready until I was...

1:25:55.150 --> 1:25:56.902
ready, you know?

1:25:57.945 --> 1:25:58.988
Of course you know.

1:25:59.071 --> 1:26:00.573
Yeah.

1:26:01.907 --> 1:26:04.994
I have to go find
my words again.

1:26:05.077 --> 1:26:06.495
Yeah.

1:26:08.455 --> 1:26:09.748
You will.

1:26:15.296 --> 1:26:16.881
I just want to say...

1:26:30.811 --> 1:26:35.482
you are an extraordinary
collection of atoms,
Henry Page.

1:28:00.109 --> 1:28:01.110
Hey, is that
Hankard?

1:28:01.193 --> 1:28:02.319
Hankard!
Hankard!

1:28:02.403 --> 1:28:04.029
Let’s go.

1:28:04.113 --> 1:28:05.698
Um, I think
I’m gonna walk.

1:28:05.781 --> 1:28:07.282
Gonna walk?

1:28:07.366 --> 1:28:09.034
Hey, whoa.

1:28:09.118 --> 1:28:10.828
I’m gonna walk too.

1:28:13.247 --> 1:28:19.920
Love of mine

1:28:22.256 --> 1:28:25.426
Unless it’s real...

1:28:25.509 --> 1:28:28.637
It’s a long walk.
Want some company?

1:28:28.721 --> 1:28:30.055
Yeah, I do.

1:29:40.334 --> 1:29:44.338
And then it’s fake

1:29:50.886 --> 1:29:57.267
It feels too late
