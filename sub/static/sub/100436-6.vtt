WEBVTT

00:04.308 --> 00:06.528
- Thanks, everybody,
for coming out

00:06.571 --> 00:08.051
to Hitchcock's
divorce party.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.661
- Why is the cake
two men getting married?

00:09.705 --> 00:11.098
- That's me and Hitchcock.
The boys are back together!

00:11.141 --> 00:12.273
- This cake
for a gay wedding.

00:12.316 --> 00:13.535
The inside is a rainbow.
- Nuh-uh.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.232
It's my favorite flavor:
all the flavors!

00:15.276 --> 00:17.191
- I can't believe
Bethany's gone.

00:17.234 --> 00:19.802
It was so out of the blue.
- Well, not entirely.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.630
I mean, she did have an affair
with her hairdresser,

00:21.673 --> 00:23.327
and you filmed it and
threatened to release the tape,

00:23.371 --> 00:24.546
and then she said
she didn't care

00:24.589 --> 00:26.069
and put it on the internet
herself,

00:26.113 --> 00:27.331
and then when it
started to make money,

00:27.375 --> 00:29.072
you sued her
for half the profits.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.682
- And then boom, out of
the blue: divorce papers.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.119
- Aw, buddy, you'll be okay.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.816
- It doesn't feel like it.

00:33.859 --> 00:36.645
My heart is ruined forever.
I'm done with love.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.255
I'll never find anyone as--

00:38.299 --> 00:41.215
Oh, my God!
Get a load of the can on her!

00:41.258 --> 00:43.565
See ya dorks,
I'm gonna get some.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.089
- Well, Hitchcock still sucks.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.415
- Hey,

01:07.458 --> 01:09.678
did you get my
sexy calendar invite?

01:09.721 --> 01:12.376
- You mean the one titled
"8:00 pm coitus"?

01:12.420 --> 01:14.857
- Yes, and the one
titled 7:55 foreplay.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.424
You didn't
accept either invite.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.382
Oh.
I can start foreplay later.

01:18.426 --> 01:19.514
- No, no, no.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.732
I love foreplay, as you know.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.125
It's just--this is all feeling

01:22.169 --> 01:24.084
a little overscheduled,
you know?

01:24.127 --> 01:26.608
It might be taking some of
the fun out of making a baby.

01:26.651 --> 01:29.698
- Oh, okay.
So what are you suggesting?

01:29.741 --> 01:32.135
- Maybe we try this
The Jake Way.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.571
- Eating dinner
starting with dessert?

01:33.615 --> 01:34.572
- That's one Jake Way.
You know?

01:34.616 --> 01:35.834
The Jake Way is a brand.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.314
It encompasses
a whole lifestyle.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.186
So get ready,
because this month,

01:39.229 --> 01:41.623
we're making a baby
The Jake Way.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.538
- Okay, I'm in.
Sounds fun.

01:43.581 --> 01:46.236
So, are we doing tonight, or...
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.282
The Jake Way does not believe
in scheduling.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.718
You gotta just let go.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.241
- You don't know
what The Jake Way is.

01:51.285 --> 01:52.373
- Nope,
but we've got a name for it,

01:52.416 --> 01:53.548
and that's a great start.

01:53.591 --> 01:54.897
The Jake Way!

01:54.940 --> 01:56.768
- Lieutenant, as you know,

01:56.812 --> 01:58.857
I've been walking the same beat
for the past three weeks.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.772
It's become a bit tedious.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.426
- I thought you loved tedium.

02:02.470 --> 02:03.862
- I love monotony.
They're very different.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.821
- I'm sorry,
but you know our policy

02:05.864 --> 02:07.257
is that uniformed officers
must walk

02:07.301 --> 02:09.172
the same beat for six months.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.435
It's how they become familiar
with the community they serve.

02:11.479 --> 02:12.871
- Well, surely you can
make an exception for me.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.351
- I can't play favorites.

02:14.395 --> 02:15.613
You never did
when you were in charge.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.137
- Of course I did.
- Really?

02:17.180 --> 02:18.442
I never got any
special treatment.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.314
- I think you
can do the math there.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.532
- Damn.

02:21.576 --> 02:22.794
Well, think of it this way:

02:22.838 --> 02:24.318
It's like doing reps at a gym.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.233
Doing something
over and over again

02:26.276 --> 02:27.756
is how you
make your pecs pop.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.888
- The only muscle
I care to work out is my brain.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.587
- Then get those reps in
and make that brain pop.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.197
Pop, pop.
Pop, pop, pop.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.894
- What you're describing
is an aneurism.

02:35.938 --> 02:38.288
- Pop, pop.
Pop, pop, pop.

02:38.332 --> 02:40.464
- It's official!
I'm in love.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.858
I just spent the night
with the woman of my dreams.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.512
- The lady from
your divorce party?

02:44.555 --> 02:45.643
- Yeah.
She's my soulmate.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.602
She's funny.
She's beautiful.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.299
She has almost no scars.
- Hot biscuits.

02:49.343 --> 02:50.909
It sounds like
you hooked a live one.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.824
- I know; we walked
along the river for hours,

02:52.868 --> 02:54.217
just talking and laughing.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.785
She even gave me
her real number.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.526
- Really?
- Check it out.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.615
- That's just a dirty
old napkin covered in sauce.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.444
- Oh, no. Her number!
It's totally ruined.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.315
I knew I shouldn't have
had those breakfast wings.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.882
- Oh, bud, I'm so sorry.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.710
- Now all I have to
remember her by is this tooth.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.712
- What the hell?
Why do you have that?

03:10.755 --> 03:12.409
- We were eating pizza,
and it fell out of her mouth.

03:12.453 --> 03:14.194
- Well, this is perfect.
We can use it to find her.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.586
- What do you mean?

03:15.630 --> 03:17.240
- We just have to try
fitting that tooth

03:17.284 --> 03:18.850
into the mouth of every woman
in New York City

03:18.894 --> 03:21.766
till we find the matching
gum hole of your one true love.

03:22.854 --> 03:25.944
- My life is like a fairytale!

03:25.988 --> 03:27.555
- So, Lieutenant,
sorry to take up your time.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.992
I just wanted to go over
the CompStat numbers.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.864
Um, what the--
- Is something wrong?

03:32.908 --> 03:36.477
Are the CompStat numbers bad?

03:36.520 --> 03:38.566
- The numbers are
fine and I have to go.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.742
- Oh, okay, then why'd you ask
for this meeting?

03:40.785 --> 03:41.917
- Don't follow me.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.484
- What?
I wasn't going to!

03:43.527 --> 03:45.921
This was a very
confusing interaction!

03:45.964 --> 03:48.663
- Hmm.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.665
Hello?
- Hello, Sergeant Santiago.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.667
I've taken your husband
hostage.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.495
If you ever want
to make a baby with him,

03:54.538 --> 03:56.323
you'll do exactly as I say.

03:56.366 --> 03:57.933
- Jake, where are you?

03:57.976 --> 03:59.935
- Oh, this isn't Jake.
This is the Syndicate.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.415
And you will never see us,

04:01.458 --> 04:02.503
because we are
everywhere and--

04:02.546 --> 04:03.852
- You're by the elevators.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.810
- Dammit! Don't--
look away! Look away!

04:05.854 --> 04:07.812
- Okay.
- Yes, that's better.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.814
On top of the copier,
there's a headset.

04:09.858 --> 04:12.339
Put it on and get in the limo
that's waiting out front.

04:12.382 --> 04:13.775
- Mm, okay, I love you.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.298
- I love you, too.
Now go!

04:18.432 --> 04:19.563
- Are you Amy?

04:19.607 --> 04:21.304
- Tell him "yes."
- Yes.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.698
- How does it feel
to be played like a puppet?

04:23.741 --> 04:26.962
- Okay,
I'm walking into the apartment.

04:27.005 --> 04:30.357
Why did you have me
get $400 out of the ATM?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.533
- Good question.
It's to pay for the Airbnb.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.578
- You're giving them
$400 in cash?

04:34.622 --> 04:37.015
- I broke several lamps while
trying to hide in the dark.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.539
Now, turn on the lights.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.410
- Okay.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.411
Hello... it's me.

04:41.455 --> 04:42.456
- Put down the drinks.

04:42.499 --> 04:43.935
- Why?
Are you upset?

04:43.979 --> 04:44.936
- Yeah, and now I have to
take The Syndicate down.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.547
- Oh, my goodness.

04:46.590 --> 04:47.591
To be clear,
by "take down The Syndicate,"

04:47.635 --> 04:48.984
you mean we're gonna have--

04:49.027 --> 04:50.594
- We're gonna have sex, yeah.
- Okay.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.030
- Yeah, absolutely.
Take your clothes off.

04:52.074 --> 04:54.381
- Boyle, what are those?

04:54.424 --> 04:56.557
- My guinea pigs.
This lady is Claire.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.037
And this guy
is also named Claire.

04:59.081 --> 05:01.518
- You can't have pets in here.
This is a police precinct.

05:01.562 --> 05:02.824
- I know, I'm sorry.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.347
I got them
for Nikolaj's birthday,

05:04.391 --> 05:05.653
but it turns out he's allergic

05:05.696 --> 05:07.089
and the pet store
won't take them back.

05:07.132 --> 05:08.438
- I've got a friend
who works in a lab.

05:08.482 --> 05:09.831
I can call and see if they need

05:09.874 --> 05:11.441
any guinea pigs
for their research.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.356
- They are not
science experiments!

05:13.400 --> 05:14.444
They are living creatures

05:14.488 --> 05:16.098
with rich inner lives.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.361
- Claire number two is
stuck on his back like a bug.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.797
- Oh, I'll handle this.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.712
Flip! Flip!

05:21.756 --> 05:22.800
Oh,
I flipped the wrong Claire.

05:22.844 --> 05:23.932
- Stop flipping guinea pigs

05:23.975 --> 05:25.455
and get them out of here!

05:25.499 --> 05:27.065
- I'll make 'em disappear,
Lieutenant.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.632
- Oh!
Don't kill them.

05:28.676 --> 05:29.981
They have so much to live for.

05:30.025 --> 05:30.982
They haven't even
been to Manhattan yet.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.636
- Okay, coast is clear.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.855
I know a safe place
we can hide these guys

05:33.898 --> 05:35.378
until we can find
homes for them.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.510
- You're not
going to murder them?

05:36.553 --> 05:37.641
- Hell no.
I love animals.

05:37.685 --> 05:38.642
I'm the mushy one on the squad.

05:38.686 --> 05:39.774
- Right, of course.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.647
- Here it is.
Supply closet K.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.083
It's full of CPR
training babies.

05:45.127 --> 05:46.389
No one goes in there
because it's too creepy.

05:48.652 --> 05:49.697
- Oh my God.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.525
It's perfect.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.527
- Well, I don't want
to take all the credit,

05:53.570 --> 05:55.442
but I'm pretty sure
doing it The Jake Way worked

05:55.485 --> 05:56.965
and we're getting pregnant.

05:57.008 --> 05:59.097
- That would be incredible, but

05:59.141 --> 06:01.970
feels like you're setting us up
for disappointment.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.102
- No, I'm just
being optimistic.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.017
You're amazing, we're amazing,

06:06.061 --> 06:07.671
and it definitely worked.

06:07.715 --> 06:08.759
- It didn't work.
- Ugh!

06:08.803 --> 06:10.370
I knew it.
I got bum nards!

06:10.413 --> 06:11.980
- Jake!
- Right, gotta stay optimistic.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.373
We can do this!

06:16.158 --> 06:18.203
- So how are you feeling?

06:18.247 --> 06:19.509
- Well, I'm pretty bummed,
but--

06:19.553 --> 06:21.032
- Amy, could you
open your mouth for me?

06:21.076 --> 06:22.425
- What? No.
- Forget it, I just saw.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.079
She's got all her teeth...

06:24.122 --> 06:25.863
- Even the back ones.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.561
- Did that
turn your mood around?

06:27.604 --> 06:29.214
- Nope.
But it's okay.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.564
I figured out how
we're gonna get pregnant.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.392
- By doubling down
on The Jake Way?

06:32.435 --> 06:33.523
Ooh, do you think we could rent
the phone booth

06:33.567 --> 06:35.307
from the movie "Phone Booth"?

06:35.351 --> 06:37.919
- No, from now on,
we're gonna do it The Amy Way.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.355
- Does that mean
we're going back to

06:39.399 --> 06:40.443
the overly scheduled sex thing?
- No.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.010
We're going way more scheduled.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.011
- Ah, so even less fun.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.316
- Big time.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.622
This is a test,
and we're failing.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.363
Because we're not
studying hard enough.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.496
- Or maybe this is just

06:49.539 --> 06:51.454
one of those tests
you can't study for?

06:54.109 --> 06:55.415
- Oh, wow, that's a new laugh.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.242
- Come on.
We're going binder shopping.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.245
- I'm off
to walk my beat again,

07:00.289 --> 07:01.551
much like Sisyphus,

07:01.595 --> 07:03.466
condemned to
push the same boulder

07:03.510 --> 07:05.512
up the same hill
day in and day out.

07:05.555 --> 07:08.079
- You know, according to French
Philosopher Albert Camus,

07:08.123 --> 07:11.474
Sisyphus achieved happiness
in that absurd repetition.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.564
- Any French philosophy
post-Rousseau is essentially

07:14.608 --> 07:16.392
a magazine.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.133
You rube.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.482
- Oh, hey, Boyle!

07:19.526 --> 07:22.398
Do you have
the 6th Street case file--

07:22.442 --> 07:23.965
Wait.
What's that?

07:24.008 --> 07:26.489
- Uh, this?
It's... my water bottle.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.231
- It looks like a water bottle
from a guinea pig cage.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.059
- True, I got it for the guinea
pigs,

07:31.102 --> 07:32.539
but they're not here anymore.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.063
So I decided to be green
and use it for myself.

07:38.022 --> 07:40.242
Ah!
Thirst quenched.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.461
- What took you so long?

07:41.504 --> 07:43.245
Terry almost caught me.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.246
I had to drink from
the guinea pigs' water bottle.

07:44.289 --> 07:45.595
Amazingly, he--

07:45.639 --> 07:47.118
- Totally bought you'd do that?
- Mm-hmm.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.119
- Yeah, I'm not surprised
at all.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.469
Good news.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.470
My niece will
take the two Claires.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.601
She wants them as pets.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.255
- That is great!
Okay.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.474
Now we just need
to find a home for ten more.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.301
- Ten?

07:56.345 --> 07:57.955
- Boy Claire got girl Claire
pregnant

07:57.999 --> 07:59.479
and made a bunch
of little baby Claires.

07:59.522 --> 08:00.567
- Oh, they're
having sex again.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.177
Mm-hmm.
Both: Oh, Claire.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.526
- Claire.
- Claire.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.702
- I gotta say,
I'm loving these.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.530
I always wanted to wear
Hammer pants.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.662
- Stop.
- Hammer time?

08:08.705 --> 08:10.228
- No.
Stop joking around.

08:10.272 --> 08:12.056
You're wearing those pants

08:12.100 --> 08:13.231
to keep your testicles away
from your body's warm core

08:13.275 --> 08:15.016
so your sperm don't overheat.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.670
- Well, I am loving the breeze.
I feel like I'm 83.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.019
- All right, focus up.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.629
This is our pregnancy war room.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.152
On the master calendar,

08:21.196 --> 08:22.371
we will track
ovulation windows,

08:22.414 --> 08:24.068
menstruation cycles,

08:24.112 --> 08:25.983
and every uterine deposit.
- "Uterine deposit"?

08:26.027 --> 08:27.768
Is that what we're calling sex?
It seems a little clinical.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.726
- Well, you could always
shorten it to U.D.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.380
or "ud."

08:31.423 --> 08:32.773
- Yeah, I don't
want to do that.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.383
- Here's a list of
everything you cannot eat

08:34.426 --> 08:35.602
while we are trying
to conceive.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.299
- No more nachos?

08:37.342 --> 08:38.561
Even if they're in
a novelty baseball helmet?

08:38.605 --> 08:39.562
- No.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.521
- Whoa, this is serious.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.305
- We will adhere to
a strict exercise regimen

08:43.348 --> 08:44.349
and sleep schedule.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.177
Also, no more video games,

08:46.221 --> 08:47.614
because they cause stress
and they raise your heart rate.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.354
- More stress
than being a police officer?

08:49.398 --> 08:51.095
- Jake, I've seen you play
"Mario Party."

08:51.139 --> 08:52.662
- Wario cheats!

08:52.706 --> 08:54.185
I'm just saying, Wario cheats.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.491
It's a stupid game.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.319
- Look, I know it isn't easy,

08:57.362 --> 08:59.147
but this could increase our
chances

08:59.190 --> 09:01.149
of getting pregnant
by 19% a month.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.237
- Yeah, of course.
Absolutely.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.543
So how do we get it started:

09:03.586 --> 09:05.109
Dim the lights,
put on some music?

09:05.153 --> 09:06.546
- Swallow 35 vitamins each.

09:06.589 --> 09:09.374
- Oh.
Cheers.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.419
- Oh.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.161
Let's make a baby!

09:15.859 --> 09:17.687
I probably should have had some
water ready.

09:17.731 --> 09:21.561
- Okay, basal
body temp is optimal.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.519
Let's do this quickly.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.478
- Oh, Amy, I'm not some faucet
you can just turn on and off.

09:26.522 --> 09:27.697
You gotta romance me.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.307
Faucet's on!
Let's ud!

09:29.351 --> 09:31.179
- Thank You.
- Spasibo.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.441
- Okay.
- Do svidaniya.

09:32.484 --> 09:34.225
- Okay.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.360
- Sorry!

09:38.403 --> 09:39.709
- I thought you separated
the males and the females.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.668
- Well, it's hard.
They're all named Claire.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.104
- You named them Claire!

09:47.717 --> 09:50.285
- Oh, come on.

09:50.328 --> 09:52.243
It's like every woman in this
city has all of her teeth.

09:52.287 --> 09:54.506
Stupid Bloomberg
and his stupid soda ban!

09:54.550 --> 09:57.118
- Okay, 6:14, it's ud o'clock!

09:57.161 --> 09:58.249
- Okay.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.643
- Here we go.
- Mm-hmm.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.819
- So this bag of pellets
is your lunch?

10:02.863 --> 10:04.299
- Yup, it's the perfect
food for a human man.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.780
You want some?
- No!

10:13.743 --> 10:15.136
- Spasibo.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.616
Do svidaniya.
- Do svidaniya.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.402
- Sorry!

10:22.447 --> 10:24.275
- Where were you?
You're 19 minutes late.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.712
My temperature is shot to hell!

10:25.755 --> 10:27.365
- I know.
I'm Sorry.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.715
I got detained
by the transit cops because

10:28.758 --> 10:30.542
my baggy pants
fell off on the subway.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.153
- Let's just ud
and get it over with.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.589
- Oh, my God.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.895
There's so many of them.

10:34.938 --> 10:35.896
- Sit.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.246
Yeah, good boy.

10:43.686 --> 10:44.774
- You awake?
- Nope.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.776
You?
- No. Let's do this.

10:46.820 --> 10:47.908
- Okay.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.779
Shirts on?
- Definitely.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.302
- Spasibo.
- Pozhaluysta.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.479
Mnogo kliyentov segodnya?

10:54.523 --> 10:55.698
- Make it a double.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.265
My heart has a hole in it.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.658
I might as well
fill it with booze.

10:58.701 --> 10:59.789
- Same for me.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.270
Except my hole's in my mouth.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.532
- It's you!

11:03.575 --> 11:05.795
My toothless Cinderella!

11:05.839 --> 11:10.278
- Well, that was definitely
technically sex.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.888
- Yep.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.542
Maybe that was the one.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.152
- Not the one.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.199
- I'm so exhausted.
- Me too.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.287
But the doctor said
that it could take a while.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.158
- I know.
It's just...

11:21.202 --> 11:23.421
we're doing everything right,
and it's still not working.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.815
What kind of perfect person do
you have to be to get pregnant?

11:25.859 --> 11:28.470
- We're having a baby!

11:28.513 --> 11:30.211
- Oh, rot in hell!

11:32.822 --> 11:34.955
- Congratulations, Hitchcock,

11:34.998 --> 11:36.608
it's the first wedding
I've ever been to

11:36.652 --> 11:37.697
with a cover charge.
- It's for our honeymoon.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.002
We're going to Barbados,

11:39.046 --> 11:40.482
and we'll have the island
all to ourselves,

11:40.525 --> 11:42.092
because it's Dengue Fever
season.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.093
- But your wife is pregnant.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.834
- You can't live in fear.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.531
Don't want to spend every
moment worried about Dengue

11:46.575 --> 11:48.664
or black mold
or those weird spots

11:48.708 --> 11:50.361
on the MRI
they found on your brain.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.798
- Hitchcock,
is your brain okay?

11:51.841 --> 11:53.974
- The point is: I don't care.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.149
Also, Anna's family
is from the Old Country

11:55.192 --> 11:56.716
and kind of conservative,

11:56.759 --> 11:58.543
so try not to mention
the baby to them.

11:58.587 --> 11:59.893
- Perfect; I'll just do
what I always do at weddings:

11:59.936 --> 12:01.677
not talk to anyone
I don't know already.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.983
- You're the best, Jake.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.071
That's why you're
the baby's godfather.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.115
- Wait.
I am?

12:05.159 --> 12:06.856
- Ugh.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.989
I can't believe
they're pregnant and we're not.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.468
How did they do it?

12:10.512 --> 12:11.774
- They got drunk and had sex

12:11.818 --> 12:13.036
in a public park
next to a skunk.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.385
Hitchcock sent me
a very long text

12:14.429 --> 12:15.604
with a lot of details in it.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.040
I think
it was meant for Scully.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.868
- Ugh, the world is officially
upside down.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.914
- Wait a minute.
Maybe that's it.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.567
We tried getting pregnant
The Jake Way;

12:22.611 --> 12:23.699
we tried The Amy Way.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.135
Maybe it's time we tried it...

12:25.179 --> 12:26.658
The Hitchcock Way.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.486
- What's The Hitchcock Way?

12:28.530 --> 12:30.053
- In every situation,
make the worst possible choice.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.186
- Okay.
What the hell?

12:32.229 --> 12:33.535
Nothing else is working.

12:33.578 --> 12:34.928
Let's try it The Hitchcock Way.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.060
- All right, so first move:
Get hammered.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.193
Drink up.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.543
- Uh, these are someone else's.
There's lipstick on mine.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.197
- Yeah,
there's a cigarette in mine.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.633
But we're doing things The
Hitchcock Way, so bottoms up!

12:44.676 --> 12:46.722
- All right.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.506
- For those of you
that don't know me,

12:48.550 --> 12:50.726
my name is Norm Scully.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.945
Hitchcock is my partner,

12:51.988 --> 12:53.773
and he's also my best friend.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.731
He buys the bear claws I like
when we're on a stakeout

12:55.775 --> 12:58.952
or when we're just
in the office or at home.

12:58.995 --> 12:59.953
I love him.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.476
Anna Rubov,

13:01.519 --> 13:03.217
do you promise
to love and cherish

13:03.260 --> 13:05.088
Michael Hitchcock as
much as I've loved him?

13:05.132 --> 13:06.437
- I do.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.525
- And, Michael Hitchcock,

13:07.569 --> 13:09.092
do you agree to shower Anna

13:09.136 --> 13:11.051
with the same love and kindness
you've shown me

13:11.094 --> 13:13.183
these 30 wonderful years
together?

13:13.227 --> 13:15.142
- I do.
- Dang.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.491
Terry didn't know
this was gonna be so sweet.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.840
- You may now kiss the bride.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.109
- Hey, Rosa, good news.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.719
I just talked to someone

13:27.763 --> 13:29.460
who said he'd take
all the guinea pigs.

13:29.504 --> 13:30.940
- All 600?
Why would he do that?

13:30.984 --> 13:32.768
- I didn't ask.
I just said yes.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.248
Our prayers have been answered!
- Who is this guy?

13:34.291 --> 13:36.032
We gotta check him out,
make sure he's not weird.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.208
- He's just a normal guy
who's a friend of Hitchcock's--

13:38.252 --> 13:39.862
yep, we gotta check him out.

13:45.694 --> 13:46.826
- Yeah, he's gonna
turn them into toupees.

13:46.869 --> 13:47.914
- Oh, my god, he is.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.132
- The Hitchcock Way is exactly

13:49.176 --> 13:51.004
what we needed, you know?

13:51.047 --> 13:52.919
These last six months have
actually been pretty hard.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.485
- Mm, no!

13:54.529 --> 13:55.704
Hitchcock doesn't
dwell on the past.

13:55.747 --> 13:58.098
Hitchcock
forgets about the past

13:58.141 --> 13:59.969
because
of the spots on his brain!

14:00.013 --> 14:00.970
- Yes.

14:01.014 --> 14:01.971
To brain spots!

14:04.278 --> 14:06.889
Both: Oh!
Cinnamon schnapps!

14:06.933 --> 14:09.544
- Barkeep, another round
of drink roulette.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.938
- Lieutenant, I never see you
at Shaw's on a Sunday.

14:11.981 --> 14:14.854
Those nights are reserved for
spending time with your family.

14:14.897 --> 14:15.898
I guess you do make...

14:15.942 --> 14:16.899
exceptions.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.292
- What?

14:18.335 --> 14:19.859
- The conversation
we had six months ago?

14:19.902 --> 14:20.860
The one where you
said you wouldn't make

14:20.903 --> 14:21.861
an exception for me.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.079
- That was so long ago.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.733
A lot has happened
since then.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.953
- Well, to me it seems like
mere minutes ago,

14:26.996 --> 14:30.173
because I've been living the
same day over and over again.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.828
- Gentlemen, would either
of you mind giving some toasts?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.874
People are starting to notice
we didn't serve any food.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.571
- I have something
I'd like to say.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.007
- Marriage is amazing.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.880
To get to spend every day
with the same person,

14:40.923 --> 14:43.883
day after day,
month after month on repeat.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.015
The comfort of knowing that
tomorrow

14:46.059 --> 14:48.670
will be just like
today is truly

14:48.713 --> 14:50.019
a rewarding assignment.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.586
To Hitchcock!

14:51.629 --> 14:52.848
- Hear hear.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.632
- I'd also like
to make a speech.

14:54.676 --> 14:58.158
Most marriages end in divorce,
and there's a reason.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.638
It's boring to be stuck
in the same routine forever.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.684
There's no value to be found

15:02.727 --> 15:04.991
in walking the same beat
over and over,

15:05.034 --> 15:06.949
especially when you've been
a captain for six years.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.691
The point is: marriage is

15:09.734 --> 15:12.737
a waste of my talents,
Lieutenant.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.914
To Hitchcock!
- These are great.

15:14.957 --> 15:15.958
- Really?

15:16.002 --> 15:17.829
- I also have a toast to make.

15:17.873 --> 15:20.180
Hitchcock, I always thought
I was better than you,

15:20.223 --> 15:23.313
because I haven't been divorced
seven times

15:23.357 --> 15:25.881
and I've never been
banned from a museum

15:25.925 --> 15:26.969
for kissing the statues.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.884
But today I realize

15:28.928 --> 15:32.192
that maybe my life would be
better if I was more like you.

15:32.235 --> 15:36.022
Anyway, I gotta go
make a baby of my own

15:36.065 --> 15:38.241
just like the baby
inside of Anna.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.114
- Nailed it.

15:41.157 --> 15:43.594
- Why is she
saying these things, Anna?

15:43.638 --> 15:45.248
- Okay, bud.

15:45.292 --> 15:48.251
Are you ready to have some
stupid Hitchcock-style sex?

15:48.295 --> 15:49.731
- Oh, yeah,
where are we going?

15:49.774 --> 15:51.124
- Nowhere.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.300
We're going right here
in Shaw's bathroom.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.910
- Oh, that's such a bad idea.

15:54.954 --> 15:55.955
I love it.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.218
All right.

15:58.261 --> 15:59.828
- Occupied!

15:59.871 --> 16:01.221
- Someone's in there.
Should we wait?

16:01.264 --> 16:02.831
- Would Hitchcock wait?

16:02.874 --> 16:05.790
- Hell no.
Hitchcock would find an alley!

16:05.834 --> 16:07.749
- Well, this is perfect.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.012
There's probably so many skunks
skunking around here.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.014
- Oh, yeah.
We're gonna make a skunk baby.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.015
- Yeah.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.756
- Hello.
- Huh?

16:14.799 --> 16:16.888
- Don't worry about me.
I don't want to join.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.760
I'm happy just to watch.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.766
- Crap; they're really
pissed that Anna's pregnant.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.376
- No, it's more
complicated than that.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.857
Anna just called her
entire family hypocrites.

16:28.900 --> 16:29.945
- Wait, you speak Russian?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.947
- Huh.
I guess I do.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.383
I must have picked it up
from speaking to that woman

16:33.427 --> 16:34.994
at the coffee cart
for the past six months.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.301
- Now what's happening?

16:38.345 --> 16:39.955
- Anna's mother says Anna

16:39.999 --> 16:42.218
should be
with someone respectable,

16:42.262 --> 16:45.221
like her sister's husband,
Boris, instead of the...

16:45.265 --> 16:46.831
Pig man.
- Well, that's too bad,

16:46.875 --> 16:48.746
'cause she already married
the pig man.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.924
What's she saying?

16:52.968 --> 16:55.362
- She says that Boris
is not a good man.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.146
He's cheating on her sister.

16:57.190 --> 17:00.062
She knows because he's
the real father of her baby.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.759
- Oh.
- What?

17:02.804 --> 17:03.892
Oh, no!

17:07.200 --> 17:08.853
- Someone's here.
This is too public!

17:08.897 --> 17:11.073
- I mean, it wouldn't
stop Hitchcock, but fine.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.292
I know a secret spot.

17:18.341 --> 17:19.821
- What was that?

17:19.864 --> 17:21.127
What am I feeling right now?
- Huh?

17:21.170 --> 17:22.867
- Are those all your
little hands?

17:35.271 --> 17:37.491
- And this is the last one.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.492
We've rounded up
all the guinea pigs.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.407
- Not even close.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.061
Guinea pig.
Guinea pig.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.063
Guinea pig.
Guinea pig.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.587
What were you thinking,
breeding guinea pigs at work?

17:46.630 --> 17:48.154
- We weren't
breeding them on purpose.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.720
They're just
very sexual creatures,

17:49.764 --> 17:50.895
and we didn't want to
slut-shame them.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.158
- Yeah.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.637
Sorry you're not
more sex-positive, Terry.

17:53.681 --> 17:54.856
- I called my friend
at the lab.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.597
He's gonna take
the guinea pigs.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.077
They're not gonna do
any chemical tests on them.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.208
They're just gonna teach them
how to run mazes.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.818
- Really?

18:00.862 --> 18:01.819
I want you to look
Claire 38 in the eye,

18:01.863 --> 18:03.212
and tell her that--

18:03.256 --> 18:05.649
- I'm sending
you to a lab, Claire; bye.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.216
- You can't do this!

18:07.260 --> 18:08.739
- This is so unfair, Terry!
- You're a cruel man!

18:08.783 --> 18:10.176
- Thank God
he found a way to end it.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.003
- Oh, it's over.
The nightmare's over.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.831
- There you are.

18:13.875 --> 18:14.963
You didn't wake me up
when you left this morning.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.225
- I tried.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.618
You said, "I'm dead.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.010
Leave me.
Find someone new."

18:19.054 --> 18:20.447
- Yeah, pretty hungover.

18:20.490 --> 18:21.448
Look, last night wasn't great,

18:21.491 --> 18:22.927
but I think I know why.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.625
We were trying
to do it like Hitchcock

18:24.668 --> 18:26.235
when we should have been
trying to do it like Boris,

18:26.279 --> 18:28.629
the man who actually
impregnated Hitchcock's wife.

18:28.672 --> 18:29.978
So I found him
on Facebook and--

18:30.021 --> 18:30.979
- Jake, stop.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.589
Why is it so easy

18:32.633 --> 18:34.983
for everyone else
to get pregnant?

18:35.026 --> 18:35.984
I mean, look at
these stupid guinea pigs.

18:36.027 --> 18:37.812
They made 600 babies,

18:37.855 --> 18:38.987
and we can't make one?

18:39.030 --> 18:40.858
Why can't we make 600 babies?

18:40.902 --> 18:42.860
- You can't compare yourself
to guinea pigs, babe.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.079
You taught me that.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.776
- I'm exhausted.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.213
And the universe
keeps telling us

18:47.256 --> 18:48.953
that it doesn't want us
to have a baby.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.216
The message
couldn't be clearer.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.826
So I'm done.

18:51.869 --> 18:54.133
- Like, done for this month?

18:54.176 --> 18:56.526
- Done.
Just done.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.054
- Thank you for seeing me.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.622
I just wanted to let you know
I was wrong.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.537
Until last night,
I didn't realize

19:07.581 --> 19:09.496
how much Russian I'd learned.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.019
- Yeah, it was impressive.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.847
And your accent was great, too.
- Thank you,

19:12.890 --> 19:14.196
but I actually speak
with the accent of a peasant.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.285
Anyway, I walked my beat
this morning,

19:16.329 --> 19:18.244
and I spoke to several people
in Russian.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.985
They were so impressed,
they opened up to me.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.988
I got a number of useful tips.
- All right.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.208
All because I made you
do something tedious.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.210
- Monotonous.
Don't ruin this.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.778
- Thanks for coming out
to Hitchcock's divorce party.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.301
- You know you got
another gay cake, right?

19:32.345 --> 19:33.868
- What?
No way.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.522
- It says "Boys! Boys! Boys!"
on it.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.654
- Because we're the boys.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.961
- Guys, I figured out what
went wrong between Anna and me.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.137
My job.
I'm a workaholic!

19:42.181 --> 19:43.834
Not anymore.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.185
From now on, I'm focusing
on what really matters.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.274
Come on, Scully,
let's get some wings.

19:48.317 --> 19:51.190
- Aw, bud,
I thought you'd never ask.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.887
- Hey, want some cake?

19:52.930 --> 19:54.018
I got a piece with a heart
on it,

19:54.062 --> 19:55.672
which I now realize is a butt.

19:55.716 --> 19:58.284
- I'm good.
Thanks.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.068
- So listen.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.070
I've been thinking about
what you said this morning...

20:02.113 --> 20:05.073
And it has been a really hard
couple of months.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.336
- I'm sorry
I'm bad at making babies.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.729
- Hey, hey, don't say that.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.165
It's not your fault.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.906
And look, for all we know,
I could have--

20:11.949 --> 20:13.951
- Don't say you have bum nards.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.606
- I wasn't--I wasn't gonna.

20:18.869 --> 20:22.177
I think maybe it's just
a thing we can't control.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.092
- That is my least
favorite kind of thing.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.746
- I know.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.791
- I really wanted
to start a family.

20:29.097 --> 20:32.318
- Amy, we are a family.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.971
You and me.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.625
So, you know,
we can keep trying

20:35.669 --> 20:38.149
or look into IVF or adoption

20:38.193 --> 20:40.935
or if we want, we can
forget about the whole thing.

20:40.978 --> 20:44.243
But if we're together,
I'm happy no matter what.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.636
- I don't know
what I want to do.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.247
- Fine.
That's okay too.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.683
We don't have to have a plan.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.337
We make the rules.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.121
Maybe it would help
to just not think

20:53.164 --> 20:54.731
about the whole thing
for a while

20:54.775 --> 20:56.124
and see where we're at.

20:56.167 --> 20:59.258
- Yeah, okay.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.650
I love you.

21:00.694 --> 21:01.999
- I love you.

21:13.097 --> 21:14.055
- Should we go?

21:14.098 --> 21:15.361
- Yes.
- Okay.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.799
- Nope.
