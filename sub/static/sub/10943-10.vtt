00:01.733 --> 00:02.900
What're you doing here?

00:02.967 --> 00:04.202
I miss the old place,

00:04.269 --> 00:05.403
so I thought I'd come back
for a while.

00:05.470 --> 00:06.404
Is Ashley coming back then?

00:06.471 --> 00:07.938
No. We're on a break.

00:08.006 --> 00:09.340
Tim: What?!
Lou: What happened?

00:09.408 --> 00:12.443
Problem with the horses.
They didn't arrive.

00:12.511 --> 00:14.144
Shane: Well, is Cisco okay?
Tim: I don't know!

00:14.213 --> 00:15.779
How are we gonna
get these horses outta here?

00:15.847 --> 00:17.347
<i>Shane:</i>
<i>We could ride them out.</i>

00:17.415 --> 00:18.848
Amy: Shane?
Ty: What are you doing here?

00:19.850 --> 00:21.318
Shane: He's got a gun!
Wade: Get down!

00:21.385 --> 00:22.985

00:23.053 --> 00:24.254
<i>Caleb:</i> <i>Amy, this one's in</i>

00:24.322 --> 00:26.055

<i>Amy:</i> <i>This one's got
some kind</i> <i>of infection</i>

00:28.859 --> 00:30.393
<i>One is standing,</i>
<i>but he's in really rough shape,</i>

00:30.461 --> 00:32.095
and we've gotta get him
to your clinic, Scott.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.596
(Loud gunshot blast)

00:33.663 --> 00:34.764
Caleb!

00:34.832 --> 00:37.199
Caleb: There wasn't anything
else we could do, Amy.

00:41.471 --> 00:43.339
(Low, tense music)

00:43.406 --> 00:46.007
(Thunder rumbles)

00:46.075 --> 00:47.476
(Loud thunderclap)

00:50.779 --> 00:52.012
We gotta take him
to your clinic, Scott.

01:01.790 --> 01:03.924

01:23.377 --> 01:25.444
(Amy sighs heavily)

01:30.950 --> 01:32.718
What? You're going?
Already?

01:32.786 --> 01:33.688
Yes, I'm going already.

01:33.689 --> 01:34.887
They're delivering the backhoe
this morning.

01:34.888 --> 01:36.389
You knew that, honey.

01:36.456 --> 01:39.090
Did anyone call for me
on the house line, by the way?

01:39.158 --> 01:40.492
Any messages at all?

01:43.962 --> 01:45.664
and no, there were no calls.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.131
(Mouthful) Okay.

01:48.167 --> 01:49.401
Mm!
Jack, I'm sorry.

01:49.468 --> 01:50.835
Lou'll make some more.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.069
Can you make some more coffee,
honey, please?

01:52.137 --> 01:53.437
Yes.

01:53.505 --> 01:55.539
Bye. I gotta go.
Bye bye, pumpkin. Bye!

01:57.575 --> 01:59.109
Now, where are my keys?

01:59.177 --> 02:01.812
I left them right here,
now I can't find them.

02:01.879 --> 02:03.880
Sorry.
We were playing.

02:05.983 --> 02:08.651
Thank you, sweetie.
Agh.

02:10.721 --> 02:11.854
Where were you?

02:11.922 --> 02:12.988
Amy:
I went on a ride.

02:13.056 --> 02:14.390
Must have left pretty early.

02:14.458 --> 02:15.958
Well, I couldn't sleep.

02:16.026 --> 02:17.694
Grandpa,
can I borrow your truck?

02:17.761 --> 02:20.863
Well, that means I'm gonna have
to ride into town with your dad.

02:20.931 --> 02:21.864
Fine!

02:21.932 --> 02:24.066
Thank...
They're wet.

02:25.635 --> 02:27.502
Shane: Hey Jack!
Jack, guess what?

02:27.570 --> 02:30.104
Caleb promised to give me
some roping tips with my steer.

02:30.172 --> 02:32.273
Yeah, well, don't let him
teach you any bad habits.

02:32.342 --> 02:33.842
Hey, you should stay
and watch me rope.

02:33.909 --> 02:35.677
I'd love to, Shane,
but I gotta help Ty.

02:35.745 --> 02:37.379
He's building onto his shed.

02:37.447 --> 02:38.380
Thank you.

02:38.448 --> 02:40.048
Bye, honey.

02:40.115 --> 02:42.550
At least something's
getting built around here.

02:42.617 --> 02:44.118
How's your project coming, Lou?

02:44.186 --> 02:45.419
Fine.

02:45.487 --> 02:46.721
You ready to go or not?

02:46.788 --> 02:48.189
Yeah.
I'm waiting for you.

02:48.257 --> 02:49.590
Where's my list?

02:50.759 --> 02:52.894
I know I put my list
right here.

02:52.962 --> 02:53.962
Now, where is it?

02:54.029 --> 02:55.663
Oh, here it is.

02:55.731 --> 02:58.932
- There you go.
- What a mad house!

02:59.000 --> 03:01.601
This day can only get better.

03:02.570 --> 03:04.238
What's wrong with him?

03:04.305 --> 03:05.572
What's the matter with him?

03:07.475 --> 03:10.110
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:10.178 --> 03:12.445
All right.
Put me to work!

03:12.513 --> 03:14.813
Ty: Well, are you here to work
or are you just gonna sit there?

03:14.882 --> 03:15.882
(Chuckles) Hey...

03:15.949 --> 03:18.017
I just had an awful sleep.

03:18.085 --> 03:19.986
I keep having that nightmare.

03:20.053 --> 03:21.053
I can't get the image
of those horses

03:21.121 --> 03:23.689
out of my mind.

03:23.757 --> 03:25.024
Hey, has Scott said anything

03:25.092 --> 03:26.893
about that horse that survived?

03:29.496 --> 03:31.429
Ty?

03:31.497 --> 03:33.431
Come on, he's said something,
hasn't he?

03:33.499 --> 03:35.033
(Sighs)

03:35.101 --> 03:37.035
The owner called Scott
just yesterday.

03:37.103 --> 03:38.736
And...?

03:38.804 --> 03:41.472
And... you're not gonna
like this.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.041
Can you tell me?

03:43.109 --> 03:45.610
He's decided that
the animal's beyond help.

03:45.677 --> 03:47.912
Okay.
So what does that mean?

03:47.979 --> 03:49.546
That means that
they're putting him down

03:49.614 --> 03:50.948
this afternoon.

03:51.016 --> 03:52.249
No. He...

03:52.317 --> 03:54.018
- I'm just gonna call--
- Amy, wait. Okay?

03:54.085 --> 03:56.320
Scott agrees with the owner,
Amy,

03:56.388 --> 03:57.587
and you know he wouldn't
put a horse down

03:57.655 --> 04:00.124
if it wasn't
absolutely necessary.

04:00.191 --> 04:03.192
Scott, hi.
It's Amy. Hi.

04:03.260 --> 04:06.095
Ty was just telling me
about that horse.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.563
Yeah.

04:07.631 --> 04:08.431
I was just wondering
if he was being euthanized

04:08.498 --> 04:10.233
because of health issues?

04:10.301 --> 04:12.335
No, it's not a health issue.

04:12.403 --> 04:14.070
What is it then?

04:14.138 --> 04:15.438
<i>Scott:</i> <i>The horse is</i>
<i>totally unmanageable.</i>

04:15.505 --> 04:16.906
He may not be in physical pain,

04:16.974 --> 04:18.373
but mentally he's a mess.

04:19.442 --> 04:20.675
Can you just bring him
to Heartland?

04:20.743 --> 04:22.811
I just would like
to take a look at him.

04:22.878 --> 04:25.780
Listen to me,
he's in terrible shape.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.249
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Okay. And if that's the case,</i>

04:27.317 --> 04:29.251
I will listen to you.
I promise.

04:29.319 --> 04:31.353
But I can't just let him
be put down

04:31.421 --> 04:32.887
without knowing the situation.

04:35.690 --> 04:36.757
I'll bring him over.

04:37.892 --> 04:39.226
Okay.
Thank you.

04:40.862 --> 04:42.029
I'm meeting Scott at Heartland.

04:42.097 --> 04:44.131
Do you wanna come?

04:44.199 --> 04:45.232
Don't give me that look.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.867
I just wanna see him.

04:48.036 --> 04:52.005
<i>(Hooves stamp heavily,</i>
<i>horse winnies and snorts)</i>

04:57.778 --> 05:00.413
Look, I'm not happy about this.

05:00.481 --> 05:01.647
This horse is not for you.

05:01.715 --> 05:03.216
I hear you.

05:03.284 --> 05:04.851
What's his name?

05:05.786 --> 05:08.187
(Scoffs) Alcatraz Run.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.694
Amy:
I wanna work with him.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.463
Why? He's crazy
and dangerous.

06:29.531 --> 06:30.964
He attacked his owner.

06:31.032 --> 06:32.466
He just tried to attack us.

Look, Amy,

06:33.701 --> 06:36.336
nobody wants
to put him down, but...

06:36.404 --> 06:38.072
He's right, Amy.

06:38.139 --> 06:39.039
I know you wanna work
with him -

06:39.107 --> 06:40.040
I know -

06:40.108 --> 06:41.875
but this is one horse

06:41.943 --> 06:43.576
you don't wanna mess with,
okay?

06:43.643 --> 06:45.978
He needs to be given a chance.

06:46.046 --> 06:47.080
Come on, Scott, let me try.

06:47.147 --> 06:48.814
He needs help.

06:48.882 --> 06:50.450
Scott: And how do you propose
you're gonna help him?

06:50.517 --> 06:51.584
Amy: Well, first, we gotta
get him out of the trailer

06:51.651 --> 06:52.885
and into the paddock.

06:52.953 --> 06:54.554
He's a race horse.
He's calmer in a stall.

06:54.621 --> 06:56.655
Fine. And he can't be put
with any other horses.

06:56.723 --> 06:58.057
No problem.

06:58.124 --> 07:00.792
That'll make it easier
for me to bond with him.

07:00.859 --> 07:04.496
Scott, I couldn't save
that other horse and...

07:04.564 --> 07:06.864
I feel like I owe it
to this guy.

07:06.932 --> 07:08.833
(Alcatraz snorts nervously)

07:08.901 --> 07:09.867
Scott: We might not even
be able to get that animal

07:09.935 --> 07:11.903
out of the trailer.

07:11.971 --> 07:13.738
You got him in there,
didn't you?

07:16.908 --> 07:18.709

07:20.011 --> 07:21.178

07:26.718 --> 07:28.152
Amy: It's okay, it's okay.

07:28.220 --> 07:29.653
(Alcatraz snorts nervously)

07:29.721 --> 07:31.354
Look, I don't wanna be
the bad guy,

07:31.422 --> 07:34.724
but I can't take responsibility
for what happens here.

07:34.791 --> 07:36.593
This is your choice, not mine,

07:36.660 --> 07:38.728
and I'm gonna make sure
Jack knows it.

07:38.795 --> 07:40.863
Scott, no. Please?

07:42.165 --> 07:43.833
This is crazy, Amy.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.635
Why are you so determined
with this horse?

07:45.702 --> 07:46.869
Because...

07:46.937 --> 07:48.270
Because of the nightmares?

07:48.338 --> 07:49.939
No. Spartan.

07:51.174 --> 07:52.942
This horse is acting
exactly like Spartan did

07:53.010 --> 07:54.777
after the accident,

07:54.845 --> 07:57.278
and he was this close
to being put down as well.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.412
Okay.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.580
And look at what
an incredible horse

07:59.649 --> 08:01.116
Spartan is now.

08:01.183 --> 08:03.752
Think about
what he would've missed.

08:03.819 --> 08:04.819
If Spartan can come back
from that,

08:04.887 --> 08:07.288
so can Alcatraz.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.456
(Alcatraz snorts nervously)

08:09.992 --> 08:11.259
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

08:11.326 --> 08:12.425
I can handle this.

08:13.361 --> 08:14.594
You should... go.

08:14.663 --> 08:15.963
No, no.
I'll stay here with you.

08:16.031 --> 08:17.564
No, it's okay.

08:17.632 --> 08:18.966
I don't need you here.

08:19.034 --> 08:20.768
(Alcatraz kicks the stall)

08:20.835 --> 08:22.803
Okay.
Be careful then, okay?

08:22.871 --> 08:24.672
I will. I'm just gonna
let him used to me.

08:24.739 --> 08:26.406
- It's okay.
- Okay.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.377
(Whinnies
and kicks against stall)

08:31.444 --> 08:33.078
(Snorts nervously)

08:34.048 --> 08:35.280
Well, all in all, (Grunting)

08:35.347 --> 08:37.015
I think I've done
a pretty damn good job.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.551
You do?

08:38.618 --> 08:40.186
I'm pretty happy with the way
things have worked out.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.321
The whole Shane thing?

08:42.389 --> 08:44.155
I mean, the kid's
really settled in.

08:44.222 --> 08:46.224
He seems a lot happier now
than he was before.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.425
I got Miranda onside,

08:47.493 --> 08:49.861
Amy and Lou are onside.

08:49.929 --> 08:50.929
Even Janice...

08:50.997 --> 08:52.397
You know, she's okay with it.

08:52.464 --> 08:54.800
So your whole world
is hunky-dory.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.267
I'm happy for you.

08:56.335 --> 08:57.803
Tim: Yep.
Now we just gotta get Peter and Lou

08:57.870 --> 09:00.204
to get their act together.

09:00.271 --> 09:02.740
How is that building project
of theirs coming anyway?

09:02.808 --> 09:03.874
They even broken ground?

09:03.942 --> 09:05.609
Don't ask.

09:05.677 --> 09:07.678
Well, the guy's got no excuse.

09:07.746 --> 09:09.379
I'm telling ya,
he's got no job.

09:09.447 --> 09:11.415
I mean, he's got nothing
but time on his hands.

09:11.482 --> 09:13.450
Well, don't bring that up
with Lou.

09:14.552 --> 09:16.319
Okay. Come on,
I'll buy you a coffee.

09:18.555 --> 09:19.655
Agh!

09:21.926 --> 09:23.426
Tim:
Jack, come on.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.234
Whoa!

09:32.969 --> 09:34.002
Come on.

09:37.807 --> 09:38.941
Peter: This thing's got all
the bells and whistles,

09:39.008 --> 09:40.408
I'm telling you.

09:40.476 --> 09:41.910
Lou: So you really wanna
do this yourself?

09:41.978 --> 09:43.078
I mean, isn't digging
a foundation

09:43.146 --> 09:45.380
a huge job for one person?

09:45.448 --> 09:46.815
Honey, do I have to remind you

09:46.883 --> 09:49.250
we tried to hire someone
we could afford

09:49.317 --> 09:50.885
and we couldn't do it.

09:50.953 --> 09:52.620
I know, I know.

09:52.687 --> 09:54.155
And, you know, honey,
if I can do this myself

09:54.223 --> 09:55.522
for the cost of the rental,

09:55.590 --> 09:57.558
we are gonna save ourselves
a pile of money.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.795
And not everybody can land a job
on their first interview,

10:00.863 --> 10:02.529
so this is the way to go.

10:02.597 --> 10:04.564
Look, honey,
I'm only bringing it up

10:04.632 --> 10:05.999
because I talked to Lisa
this morning

10:06.067 --> 10:07.734
and suddenly there are
a ton of bookings

10:07.802 --> 10:09.803
coming up at the cabins.

10:09.871 --> 10:11.838
- Bookings?
- Yeah.

10:11.906 --> 10:13.473
Honey, why would she
be taking bookings?

10:13.540 --> 10:14.808
She knew that we were starting.

10:14.876 --> 10:16.076
Well, we told her
we've been starting for weeks,

10:16.144 --> 10:19.412
so I guess she just sorta
gave up on us.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.046
Anyway, there are bookings,

10:21.114 --> 10:22.547
and I promised her
that all of this

10:22.615 --> 10:25.651
wouldn't interfere with them.

10:25.718 --> 10:26.886
That's fine.
Good.

10:26.953 --> 10:28.353
That's great.
No pressure then, right?

10:30.423 --> 10:32.858
I'm making you
something extra special.

10:32.926 --> 10:34.526
You're gonna love it.

10:40.099 --> 10:41.166
Good boy.

10:43.368 --> 10:44.635
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:44.703 --> 10:46.004
(Snorts and stamps)

10:46.071 --> 10:47.138
It's okay.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.674
Good boy.

10:55.413 --> 10:56.947
Newcomer.

10:57.015 --> 10:59.049
What, you don't recognize him?

10:59.117 --> 11:00.851
<i>It's the horse</i> <i>from the coulee.</i>

11:00.919 --> 11:02.686
You know,
the one you didn't shoot.

11:02.753 --> 11:03.954
That's mean.

11:04.022 --> 11:06.156
But I had no choice,
it had to be done.

11:06.224 --> 11:08.657
I know. I know,
I just...

11:08.725 --> 11:10.960
I still have dreams about it.

11:11.028 --> 11:12.061
About me?

11:13.363 --> 11:14.630
More like nightmares, Caleb.

11:14.698 --> 11:15.431
(Alcatraz whinnies
and kicks the stall)

11:15.498 --> 11:17.900
Whoa!
He's dangerous!

11:19.169 --> 11:20.569
<i>I rode a bronc like him</i>
<i>last year.</i>

11:20.637 --> 11:22.471
All he wanted to do
was kill me.

11:22.539 --> 11:23.905
He had that same look
in his eye.

11:27.810 --> 11:28.877
So...

11:30.112 --> 11:31.046
I need some advice.

11:31.113 --> 11:32.214
Okay.

11:32.281 --> 11:34.015
It's Ashley's birthday
tomorrow and...

11:34.083 --> 11:35.783
Is it weird
if I get her flowers?

11:35.852 --> 11:37.986
I know we're separated
technically, but...

11:38.054 --> 11:39.920
I think it would be
really sweet.

11:39.988 --> 11:41.822
Well, I'm a sweet guy.

11:41.890 --> 11:44.291
How is it going
with you two anyway?

11:44.359 --> 11:45.826
Good.
A lot better.

11:45.894 --> 11:47.427
I mean, we've been talking
a ton.

11:47.495 --> 11:49.263
Well, Ashley talks, I listen.

11:49.331 --> 11:50.430
Right.

11:52.667 --> 11:53.734
<i>(Steer moos)</i>

11:59.439 --> 12:00.506
<i>(Steer moos)</i>

12:04.278 --> 12:05.745
(Breathing heavily)

12:10.550 --> 12:11.684
(Gate squeaks open)

12:11.752 --> 12:14.652
So... you wanna say
something?

12:15.588 --> 12:16.955
What was that--

12:17.023 --> 12:20.525
Lisa kissing some guy
in the middle of town?

12:20.593 --> 12:22.660
You're not upset by that?

12:22.728 --> 12:24.596
No, I'm not upset.

12:25.498 --> 12:27.599
- You're not upset.
- No.

12:31.003 --> 12:32.403
The hell you're not.

12:36.108 --> 12:37.508
Tim: Hey! Shane?
Get out of the pen

12:37.575 --> 12:39.643
before that steer
makes you eat dirt.

12:39.711 --> 12:41.245
Chill.
He's just standing there.

12:41.313 --> 12:42.613
I was waiting for Caleb.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.980
Where's Caleb?

12:44.048 --> 12:47.750
Can I please have
one dozen pink carnations?

12:47.818 --> 12:49.185
Actually, you know what?

12:49.253 --> 12:50.954
Make that two dozen.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.925
Yeah...
They're our wedding flower.

12:55.826 --> 12:58.128
And, uh, when will they arrive?

12:59.430 --> 13:02.464
Yeah, that's...
That's great actually.

13:05.635 --> 13:07.569
<i>Just... hold on.</i>

13:13.810 --> 13:15.144
Did you order the flowers?

13:16.946 --> 13:18.646
Shane:
It's about time.

13:18.713 --> 13:22.550
Tim: Hey, Caleb, you left this
kid in the pen by himself.

13:22.617 --> 13:25.219
Caleb!
What're you thinking?

13:26.322 --> 13:27.422
(Engine roars)

13:29.291 --> 13:31.559
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>You ate all your food.</i>

13:31.626 --> 13:33.693
That's a good boy.

13:34.829 --> 13:36.363
(Deadbolt rattles)

13:37.332 --> 13:38.365
Okay.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.235
I'm just gonna grab your bucket,
all right?

13:42.303 --> 13:43.503
Be a good boy.

13:46.474 --> 13:47.874
(Alcatraz screams
and stamps heavily)

13:52.379 --> 13:54.013
(Snorting and stamping,
agitated)

13:57.439 --> 14:00.574
(Birds sing,
chimes jingle lightly)

14:06.581 --> 14:08.515
(Divorce papers flutter)

14:08.583 --> 14:09.850
(Scribbles rapidly)

14:21.628 --> 14:24.030
(Door bangs shut,
car engine starts)

14:26.133 --> 14:29.001
I mean, what does Peter know
about digging a foundation?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.604
Lou, you've got to let Peter
do what he can

14:31.671 --> 14:33.338
to build his own home.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.107
It's an elemental need.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.942
An elemental need?

14:37.009 --> 14:38.309
Goes back to the cave man.

14:38.377 --> 14:41.847
You know, hunt, gather,
provide shelter.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.083
So how are those interviews
going for him?

14:45.151 --> 14:47.052
So is that another
elemental need?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.452
To earn a living?

14:48.519 --> 14:50.287
Well, it doesn't hurt.

14:50.355 --> 14:51.756
I have a job.

14:51.823 --> 14:52.890
I know.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.395
That's yet another need
for a man;

14:58.463 --> 15:00.231
To pull his own weight.

15:00.298 --> 15:02.967
Peter is pulling
his own weight.

15:03.034 --> 15:04.634
Boy, you and Dad...

15:04.701 --> 15:06.502
(Phone rings)

15:06.570 --> 15:07.637
(Jack sighs)

15:10.040 --> 15:11.107
Hello.

15:12.076 --> 15:13.576
Lisa.

15:13.644 --> 15:14.978
Well, yeah.

15:15.045 --> 15:18.915
I answered the phone,
so I guess I'm around.

15:18.983 --> 15:22.484
Well, if you're coming this way,
drop in then.

15:22.551 --> 15:24.119
All right.

15:24.187 --> 15:25.353
(Phone beeps off)

15:26.256 --> 15:28.223
That was a little cold.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.025
What's going on
between you two?

15:30.093 --> 15:31.160
Nothing.

15:36.064 --> 15:37.265
Oh, come on.

15:39.835 --> 15:41.102
- Hey...
- Hey.

15:42.204 --> 15:43.304
I'm sorry to barge in.

15:43.371 --> 15:45.072
I know this is your place now.

15:45.140 --> 15:47.775
No, man, I'm not gonna change
the locks on you.

15:47.843 --> 15:49.076
What're you looking for?

15:49.144 --> 15:51.512
My CPRA card -
I forgot to renew it.

15:51.579 --> 15:53.079
Grand Prairie rodeo's
coming up.

15:53.147 --> 15:54.514
Ah, here we are...

15:54.581 --> 15:55.515
I'm gonna try bull riding.

15:55.582 --> 15:56.649
Chad says I'm ready.

15:56.717 --> 15:58.251
Really?

15:58.319 --> 15:59.585
Yeah.

15:59.653 --> 16:00.653
I'll see ya.

16:00.721 --> 16:01.788
Oh, hey, hey...

16:03.424 --> 16:05.158
Are you all right?

16:08.128 --> 16:11.297
Ashley filed for divorce.

16:13.934 --> 16:15.000
<i>Lisa:</i>
<i>Yoo-hooo!</i>

16:16.769 --> 16:18.137
Hi.
Have you eaten?

16:19.105 --> 16:20.539
Jack:
Nope.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.208
Good!
I bought some sandwiches

16:22.275 --> 16:24.675
at that great new bakery
in town.

16:24.743 --> 16:26.344
Wanna eat on the porch?
It's such a nice day.

16:26.411 --> 16:28.179
Yeah.
I saw you in town.

16:28.247 --> 16:30.648
Oh? When?
Why didn't you say hi?

16:30.716 --> 16:33.484
Oh, I didn't wanna interrupt.
You were busy.

16:33.552 --> 16:35.320
No, let's eat here.
I think it's gonna rain.

16:37.256 --> 16:38.323
All right.

16:41.893 --> 16:43.526
I can't believe this.

16:43.594 --> 16:46.629
I was ordering flowers for her.

16:46.697 --> 16:47.898
What is Ashley thinking?

16:47.966 --> 16:49.333
She's thinking we're over.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.901
That much is pretty damn clear.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.302
And you see this?

16:53.271 --> 16:55.638
I'm supposed to sign it
and send it back to her

16:55.706 --> 16:57.240
so she knows I got it.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.908
Well, hell no!

17:00.344 --> 17:02.611
I am not signing a damn thing!

17:02.679 --> 17:05.982
<i>I'm not sending</i> <i>anything back!</i>

17:06.049 --> 17:08.684
What are you doing, Caleb?

17:08.752 --> 17:10.586
I'm going
to Grand Prairie rodeo.

17:11.554 --> 17:14.189
I just gotta get
the hell outta here, man.

17:14.257 --> 17:16.391
Just gotta get outta here.

17:22.598 --> 17:23.798
Lou tell that we're up
to our eyeballs

17:23.866 --> 17:25.934
in dude ranch bookings?

17:26.002 --> 17:27.734
We had a nice little review
in a camping magazine

17:27.803 --> 17:28.903
and all of a sudden

17:28.970 --> 17:30.938
all these emails
started pouring in.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.039
It's very exciting.

17:32.107 --> 17:33.974
Mm-hm.

17:34.943 --> 17:36.743
Okay.
What's eating you?

17:36.811 --> 17:38.545
Nothing.

17:38.613 --> 17:40.114
Is it the sandwich?
Too much mayo for you?

17:40.181 --> 17:42.182
The sandwich was fine.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.550
Well, I know when
you're in a mood.

17:44.618 --> 17:45.751
So what's the deal?

17:45.819 --> 17:47.287
No deal.

17:47.354 --> 17:50.189
Just saw you and some guy
parked outside Maggie's

17:50.257 --> 17:52.491
looking pretty friendly.

17:52.559 --> 17:53.726
What?

17:53.794 --> 17:55.494
Oh! That was Dan.

17:55.562 --> 17:58.064
Dan... Hartfield?
Your ex?

17:58.132 --> 18:00.232
Yes. We are, uh-
we have a partnership.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.499
What kind of partnership?

18:01.567 --> 18:03.035
I've made a valuable contact

18:03.102 --> 18:05.170
with this highly regarded
breeder in Europe and...

18:05.238 --> 18:06.671
It looks like
he's going to grant me

18:06.739 --> 18:08.106
exclusive import rights

18:08.174 --> 18:10.208
on this very rare
Belgian warm blood.

18:10.276 --> 18:11.876
So?

18:11.945 --> 18:14.413
So, I needed somebody
with deep pockets

18:14.480 --> 18:16.647
and Dan was interested.

18:16.714 --> 18:19.383
Oh, surely Dan Hartfield
isn't the only one

18:19.451 --> 18:22.920
in your social circle
with deep pockets?

18:22.988 --> 18:24.221
My social circle?

18:24.289 --> 18:25.356
I wasn't aware
I had a social circle.

18:25.424 --> 18:26.457
Of course you do.

18:26.524 --> 18:28.426
All those hoity-toity
horse people

18:28.493 --> 18:31.429
at the polo club
and the breeder's cup

18:31.496 --> 18:33.830
and Spruce Meadows
that you hang out with

18:33.831 --> 18:35.398
when you're not slumming here
with me.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.068
Excuse me?

18:38.135 --> 18:39.402
Didn't you and Dan try
being business partners

18:39.470 --> 18:40.437
once before?

18:40.504 --> 18:41.604
That didn't turn out so well.

18:41.672 --> 18:43.106
At least, that's how
you made it sound.

18:43.174 --> 18:44.842
(Door closes)

18:44.974 --> 18:45.842
Oh! Hey, Lisa!

18:45.909 --> 18:47.310
Broke ground
at the dude ranch today.

18:47.378 --> 18:48.844
Should be done in another
month or so...

18:48.911 --> 18:50.346
Foundation, anyway.

18:50.413 --> 18:52.514
A month?
(Sighs)

18:54.684 --> 18:57.219
Well, this has been fun.

19:02.959 --> 19:04.092
(Phone rings)

19:06.261 --> 19:08.296
(Snorting nervously)

19:15.070 --> 19:16.504
So I hear you've taken on
a new horse.

19:16.571 --> 19:17.538
What do you think
you're doing, Amy?

19:17.606 --> 19:18.539
Scott...

19:18.607 --> 19:20.540
Oh, don't go blaming him.

19:20.608 --> 19:23.243
Sorry, but Jack needed to have
back story on this guy.

19:23.311 --> 19:24.577
I'm tired of everyone
just assuming

19:24.645 --> 19:26.646
that he's a lost cause.

19:26.714 --> 19:27.947
No assuming going on here.

19:28.016 --> 19:30.150
I just want to try
and work with him.

19:30.218 --> 19:31.418
Well, do you have a game plan?

19:31.486 --> 19:32.886
Yeah, I do.

19:32.953 --> 19:35.188
This horse hates people,
and for good reason.

19:35.256 --> 19:37.356
He's been kidnapped,
he's been abused,

19:37.424 --> 19:38.424
<i>he was jabbed with needles,</i>

19:38.492 --> 19:40.026
and run to death.

19:40.093 --> 19:43.429
So I've got him on some herbs,
just to calm him down.

19:43.497 --> 19:44.497
And then I'm gonna take him
out in the round pen,

19:44.498 --> 19:45.464
and I'm gonna work with him.

19:45.532 --> 19:49.335
'Cause he's gotta trust me
before he can trust anyone else.

19:49.403 --> 19:50.969
Does that sound like a plan?

19:51.038 --> 19:52.803
Well, good luck with that.

19:52.871 --> 19:54.105
I just wanted to make sure

19:54.173 --> 19:56.207
everybody was on
the same page here.

19:56.275 --> 19:57.308
See you guys later.

20:01.980 --> 20:03.181
Why is everybody so negative?

20:03.249 --> 20:04.615
(Alcatraz snorts
and lunges threateningly)

20:09.587 --> 20:10.620
(Snorts)

20:15.260 --> 20:18.795
Very rarely do I question
what you do,

20:19.730 --> 20:21.498
but we've got
just about enough going on

20:21.566 --> 20:22.933
in our crazy household

20:23.000 --> 20:24.600
without you bringing
a horse like that

20:24.668 --> 20:25.868
into the mix.

20:25.936 --> 20:28.671
- I know. Grandpa, listen--
- No. You listen.

20:28.738 --> 20:31.707
I'm trying to be calm,
I'm trying to be civil,

20:31.775 --> 20:34.143
but I don't need
one more thing on my plate.

20:34.211 --> 20:35.878
It's not on your plate,
it's on mine.

20:35.946 --> 20:38.147
If it's on yours, it's on mine.

20:38.215 --> 20:40.582
I want that horse gone.

20:42.017 --> 20:42.784
What?

20:42.851 --> 20:45.320
I'm telling you right now, Amy,

20:45.388 --> 20:47.889
I can't cope with one more
potential problem.

20:54.097 --> 20:55.430
(Car rumbles)

20:58.300 --> 20:59.533
(Rope whooshes)

21:01.836 --> 21:03.304
Tim:
Close!

21:03.371 --> 21:04.472
Close.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.241
You've come a long way.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.210
Yeah. I told you,
I've been practicing.

21:09.277 --> 21:11.378
Well, it shows.

21:11.446 --> 21:12.412
You know, eventually,
you'll be ready

21:12.480 --> 21:13.413
for the real thing.

21:13.481 --> 21:15.448
And when you are,

21:15.516 --> 21:16.682
I'll let you practice on that,

21:16.750 --> 21:17.783
but you gotta be in here
with somebody

21:17.851 --> 21:18.751
at all times, you hear me?

21:18.819 --> 21:19.885
Okay! Okay!
I get it.

21:19.953 --> 21:22.255
Hey! Cut me some slack.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.823
I just want to send you home
in one piece.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.627
Do I have to go home?

21:27.694 --> 21:29.761
What do you mean,
"do I have to go home"?

21:29.829 --> 21:31.896
Well, I was thinking, um...

21:33.633 --> 21:35.334
Maybe I could hang out here,

21:35.401 --> 21:36.701
you know,
go to school in Hudson.

21:37.604 --> 21:38.803
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

21:38.871 --> 21:40.405
Okay, c'mon.
C'mon.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.141
Throw the rope.

21:42.208 --> 21:44.142
(Rope whooshes)

21:45.043 --> 21:47.878
(Laughs) Yes!
That's it!

21:47.946 --> 21:48.912
(Car rumbles)

21:50.815 --> 21:52.550
I'll turn you
into a pro--

21:53.485 --> 21:54.452
(door slams)

21:54.520 --> 21:55.753
Hey you!

21:55.820 --> 21:58.088
Hi! Mom,
what're you doing here?

22:00.091 --> 22:01.724
Did you see that?
I roped it!

22:01.792 --> 22:03.360
Miranda:
Yeah. Yeah.

22:03.427 --> 22:05.862
You wanna wait for me
in the house?

22:07.465 --> 22:10.500
Yeah, yeah.
Just wait in the house.

22:15.239 --> 22:16.472
I wanna talk to you.

22:19.442 --> 22:20.976
<i>Shane: (On video)</i> <i>He's got a gun!
</i> <i>(Gunshots blasts)</i>

22:21.044 --> 22:22.110
<i>Wade:</i>
<i>Get down!</i>

22:25.282 --> 22:26.848
See, I don't have my glasses,

22:26.916 --> 22:28.284
so I can't see that.

22:28.351 --> 22:29.485
Miranda: Oh, come on,
even without your glasses

22:29.553 --> 22:30.786
you can see that there is a man

22:30.853 --> 22:32.687
pointing a gun at my son.

22:32.754 --> 22:34.389
There's illegal horse racing,

22:34.456 --> 22:35.723
criminals,

22:35.791 --> 22:36.924
and Shane was right
in the middle of it.

22:36.992 --> 22:38.693
Where-
were you even there?

22:38.760 --> 22:40.595
No. No,
and I have a reason.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.564
Oh really?
I'd like to hear it.

22:42.631 --> 22:44.765
Well, I have a racehorse
that was hijacked

22:44.833 --> 22:46.201
on its way to its maiden race,

22:46.268 --> 22:48.202
and there was this
whole police investigation.

22:48.269 --> 22:50.170
And you probably
don't know this,

22:50.238 --> 22:51.938
but if you don't get involved
in the investigations-

22:52.006 --> 22:54.741
I don't care about
your racehorse, Tim.

22:54.809 --> 22:56.310
How dare you put
my son in danger!

22:56.377 --> 22:57.544
Our son!

22:57.612 --> 22:58.812
And what were Ty
and Amy thinking?

22:58.879 --> 22:59.879
They could've been killed!

22:59.947 --> 23:00.980
Well, they weren't killed.

23:01.048 --> 23:02.716
But they could've been.

23:02.783 --> 23:05.851
And how do I find out?
On Facebook!

23:05.919 --> 23:10.155
Not a phone call from you
or from Shane!

23:12.158 --> 23:15.294
Did you tell him
not to tell me?

23:15.362 --> 23:17.496
Okay, that's enough.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.797
You know what?

23:18.865 --> 23:22.467
I was an idiot
to trust you with him.

23:22.535 --> 23:26.939
I made a big mistake
and I'm gonna correct it.

23:28.441 --> 23:29.474
Miranda!

23:33.336 --> 23:36.003
<i>Miranda:</i> <i>Shane! C'mon.</i>
<i>Pack it up, we're going.</i>

23:36.071 --> 23:37.537
- What?
<i>Miranda: We're going.</i>

23:37.605 --> 23:39.473
Miranda, what's going on here?

23:39.540 --> 23:41.108
I'm taking Shane home.
That's what's going on.

23:41.176 --> 23:42.742
No!

23:42.810 --> 23:44.311
This is crazy.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.546
Come on, I still have two weeks
before school starts.

23:46.614 --> 23:48.582
Shane, do as your told.

23:49.851 --> 23:52.818
No. No way.
It's not fair.

23:52.886 --> 23:54.020
Can we talk about this?

23:54.088 --> 23:55.888
Shane, get your stuff.

23:55.956 --> 23:57.156
It's at Big River.

23:57.224 --> 23:58.924
Then we'll pick it up
on the way out!

24:01.561 --> 24:04.097
Amy, I can't believe
you would put a child in danger.

24:04.164 --> 24:05.598
What?

24:05.665 --> 24:07.599
Your little episode
with the illegal racing guys.

24:07.666 --> 24:09.167
Yeah, I know all about it.

24:09.235 --> 24:10.702
Look, we didn't even know
that Shane was in there!

24:10.769 --> 24:12.204
He hid in the back
of the truck.

24:12.271 --> 24:13.472
In the back of the truck!

24:13.539 --> 24:15.740
Wow! That's great!

24:15.808 --> 24:17.209
If we had have known
he was there,

24:17.276 --> 24:18.610
Ty and I would never
have gone into that place!

24:18.677 --> 24:20.812
But you did,
and obviously you stayed

24:20.880 --> 24:22.313
even after you found out
he was there!

24:22.381 --> 24:23.614
He helped us!

24:23.681 --> 24:24.415
We couldn't have rescued
those horses,

24:24.483 --> 24:25.616
if it wasn't for him.

24:25.683 --> 24:27.284
So rescuing horses
is more important

24:27.352 --> 24:28.819
than the safety of my son?

24:28.887 --> 24:29.953
All right!

24:32.824 --> 24:35.326
Miranda,
you've had a long drive.

24:35.394 --> 24:38.094
So let's all just sit down
like civilized people,

24:38.162 --> 24:39.629
we'll have some dinner,

24:39.696 --> 24:41.764
and just let cooler
heads prevail.

24:47.471 --> 24:49.539
(Tense silence)

24:56.012 --> 24:58.780
Lou: So why are all the
horses out in the field?

24:58.848 --> 24:59.981
Amy: Because I'm working
with a new horse

25:00.050 --> 25:01.183
and he needs the barn
to himself.

25:01.251 --> 25:02.284
Not for long.

25:02.352 --> 25:03.552
For as long as I need.

25:03.619 --> 25:06.621
I told you I wanted him out.
Period.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.659
So how's that house
of yours coming, Peter?

25:11.726 --> 25:14.228
Good. Good.
We started on the foundation.

25:14.296 --> 25:16.097
They're building a house,
Lou and Peter,

25:16.165 --> 25:17.198
at the dude ranch.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.799
It's not
a construction site yet,

25:18.867 --> 25:20.901
so you can stay there tonight.

25:20.969 --> 25:22.170
No. I told you,
we're leaving.

25:22.237 --> 25:23.504
Mom!

25:23.572 --> 25:26.406
Look, it's a little late
to leave for Moose Jaw.

25:26.474 --> 25:27.441
Plus, we need to talk.

25:27.508 --> 25:29.509
There's nothing to talk about.

25:29.577 --> 25:31.278
Well, it's a little late
to drive.

25:31.345 --> 25:32.446
It'll be dark.

25:32.513 --> 25:34.347
So... so stay tonight,
leave tomorrow.

25:34.415 --> 25:36.083
Well, I'm staying with you.

25:36.150 --> 25:37.050
No. You're staying
with your mother

25:37.118 --> 25:38.518
<i>at the dude ranch.</i>

25:38.586 --> 25:39.953
<i>Shane:</i>
<i>Fine.</i>

25:40.020 --> 25:41.621
But we're leaving first thing
in the morning.

25:41.689 --> 25:42.754
Fine.

25:45.658 --> 25:47.993
<i>(Nearby, a vehicle door</i>
<i>opens and closes)</i>

25:50.464 --> 25:51.863
<i>(Approaching footsteps)</i>

25:59.671 --> 26:00.671
It's so beautiful.

26:00.739 --> 26:01.806
Yeah.

26:01.873 --> 26:04.909
Well, it's yours
to enjoy anytime.

26:04.977 --> 26:07.044
It's sad really.

26:07.113 --> 26:08.413
I miss that feeling
of hope I had

26:08.481 --> 26:11.416
when all this started.

26:11.484 --> 26:14.451
It's a shame it ended so badly.

26:15.420 --> 26:17.621
It doesn't end badly at all.

26:17.688 --> 26:18.788
You did the right thing
bringing Shane here.

26:18.856 --> 26:21.024
I think it's turned out okay.

26:21.092 --> 26:23.059
No it hasn't.
How can you say that?

26:23.128 --> 26:24.194
Because it has.
He's happy.

26:24.262 --> 26:26.597
He and I get along really well,

26:26.664 --> 26:28.665
and we've had
some adventures...

26:28.733 --> 26:30.533
Adventures.
Yeah, right.

26:30.601 --> 26:31.734
You know, the truth is,

26:31.801 --> 26:32.568
I think he feels like
a bit of a hero

26:32.636 --> 26:34.003
after saving those horses,

26:34.070 --> 26:36.772
and that is not a bad thing
for a boy his age to feel.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.342
But... okay,
I-I'm sorry.

26:39.409 --> 26:42.044
You have every reason to feel
a little ticked off.

26:42.112 --> 26:43.646
Ticked off?

26:43.713 --> 26:45.014
I'm a little more
than ticked off.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.282
I can't tell you
what happened to my stomach

26:46.350 --> 26:47.783
when I saw that video.

26:47.851 --> 26:49.151
Well, Shane just put it
together

26:49.218 --> 26:50.786
like the movie people
with all the exciting and-

26:50.854 --> 26:51.820
(sighs) Oh God...

26:51.888 --> 26:54.589
Okay, okay.
I'm kidding.

27:01.698 --> 27:04.431
He loves it here.
He loves riding,

27:04.499 --> 27:05.599
he's learning to rope.

27:05.668 --> 27:07.535
Of course he loves it here.

27:07.602 --> 27:09.937
Who wouldn't?

27:10.005 --> 27:12.140
It makes home look boring.

27:12.207 --> 27:13.507
And that's something
I have to deal with,

27:13.575 --> 27:15.943
believe me.

27:16.011 --> 27:17.545
Anyway, that doesn't matter.

27:17.612 --> 27:21.414
What does matters is...
you haven't changed.

27:22.383 --> 27:24.718
<i>You're still irresponsible</i>

27:24.786 --> 27:26.753
and I can't trust you with him,

27:26.821 --> 27:29.255
and that...
that's sad.

27:30.558 --> 27:32.025
Good night.

27:42.002 --> 27:45.504
Lou: Okay, Lisa.
Look, I understand, but...

27:47.307 --> 27:48.774
Yeah. Fine.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.409
(Phone beeps off)

27:53.245 --> 27:55.646
Lisa...
She's furious with us.

27:56.582 --> 27:58.717
Apparently Peter told her
it would take a month

27:58.784 --> 28:01.119
to finish digging
the foundation.

28:01.187 --> 28:02.754
Of course, he should've been
the one to talk to her,

28:02.822 --> 28:05.256
but he's sound asleep.

28:06.192 --> 28:07.257
(Sighs)

28:09.327 --> 28:11.261
You know, between me and you,

28:11.329 --> 28:13.330
I'm not so sure this
whole building thing

28:13.397 --> 28:14.865
is the right way to go either.

28:14.933 --> 28:16.299
It'll be fine.

28:17.202 --> 28:19.669
But honestly,
Lisa shouldn't be so upset.

28:19.738 --> 28:21.138
She agreed to this.

28:21.206 --> 28:22.606
You know, it's not like
we didn't tell her about it.

28:22.673 --> 28:25.708
We were totally up front
with her.

28:26.676 --> 28:27.844
Can you talk to her?

28:27.911 --> 28:29.112
No.

28:29.179 --> 28:30.479
Grandpa, she'll listen to you.

28:30.547 --> 28:31.914
No.

28:31.982 --> 28:33.182
Work it out amongst yourselves

28:33.250 --> 28:35.718
and leave me out of it.

28:36.620 --> 28:39.554
Is there something going on
between you and Lisa?

28:39.622 --> 28:41.289
I'm gonna go to bed.

28:41.357 --> 28:42.824
Good night.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.433
(Moans)

28:57.038 --> 28:58.639
He's in really rough shape.

28:58.706 --> 29:00.274
(Gunshot blasts)

29:00.341 --> 29:01.541
(Gasps, startled)

29:01.609 --> 29:03.010
(Horse whinnies in the distance)

29:29.303 --> 29:30.336
(Lock clicks)

(Snorts softly)

30:04.803 --> 30:06.469
(Snorts softly)

30:16.680 --> 30:17.948
(Alcatraz grunts and screams)

30:18.015 --> 30:19.950
(Hard thump, Amy gasps in pain)

30:20.017 --> 30:21.450
(Stamping and snorting
nervously)

30:22.352 --> 30:23.719
(Panting)

30:23.786 --> 30:27.022
(Alcatraz whinnies sharply,
stamps heavily)

30:29.765 --> 30:32.633
<i>(Birdsong fills the air)</i>

30:36.937 --> 30:37.970
(Wincing in pain)

30:39.607 --> 30:41.074
(Knock on door)

30:41.142 --> 30:43.043
Ty: Amy, I've been
thinking about that horse.

30:43.111 --> 30:44.811
Maybe I'm wrong.

30:44.879 --> 30:47.447
If it's all right,
I'd like to help you with him.

30:51.451 --> 30:53.219
I'm phoning Scott.

30:53.287 --> 30:54.921
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Ty, please!</i>

30:54.988 --> 30:56.222
Ty: You haven't been listening
to me and now you're hurt.

30:56.290 --> 30:57.589
This was my fault!

30:57.657 --> 30:58.791
He attacked you, Amy!

30:58.858 --> 30:59.992
You're lucky you
got outta there.

31:00.060 --> 31:01.360
I misread his signals!

31:01.428 --> 31:02.561
I should never have gone
in the stall like that.

31:02.629 --> 31:04.696
Come on, please.
I screwed up!

31:05.631 --> 31:06.697
Look at him.

31:06.765 --> 31:08.166
He's freaking out
in there, Amy!

31:08.234 --> 31:10.835
He just needs more time.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.539
What is with you
and this animal?

31:14.606 --> 31:16.874
I couldn't save the other one!

31:16.943 --> 31:18.043
I should've stopped Caleb!

31:18.110 --> 31:19.044
Amy...

31:19.111 --> 31:20.611
This was my fault!

31:20.679 --> 31:23.280
Amy, these nightmares have
seriously messed you up!

31:23.348 --> 31:25.382
Ty, can you please just leave?

31:25.450 --> 31:26.516
Please?

31:39.029 --> 31:40.430
That horse in there,

31:40.497 --> 31:42.365
I should've shot him too.

31:42.433 --> 31:44.733
Kept me up all night.

31:45.936 --> 31:48.104
It's a little early
in the day for that, isn't it?

31:48.172 --> 31:50.006
Where are you going?

31:50.074 --> 31:51.240
What do you mean,
where am I going?

31:51.308 --> 31:53.008
I'm goin' to
Grand Prairie rodeo.

31:53.076 --> 31:54.276
I'm gonna go ride bulls.

31:54.344 --> 31:56.511
Caleb, you can't go, man.
You're drunk.

31:56.579 --> 31:57.645
Not drunk enough.

31:57.713 --> 31:59.281
Caleb, come on, man.

31:59.349 --> 32:00.482
Get outta my way, Ty.

32:00.549 --> 32:01.316
Caleb, don't be an idiot,
all right?!

32:01.384 --> 32:02.484
(Beer bottle smashes)

32:03.752 --> 32:04.752
(Fighting grunts)

32:04.820 --> 32:05.887
Caleb:
Let go of me!

32:05.955 --> 32:07.122
Let go of me!

32:07.190 --> 32:08.357
Caleb, you're not
going anywhere.

32:08.424 --> 32:09.957
Let me go!

32:10.025 --> 32:12.226
You're not going anywhere,
buddy.

32:12.294 --> 32:13.694
Okay... (Panting)
Okay.

32:17.432 --> 32:18.799
(Panting)

32:22.937 --> 32:24.271
(Exhales)

32:28.142 --> 32:29.876
What am I gonna do?

32:31.445 --> 32:34.847
Well, being drunk before noon
isn't helping.

32:34.915 --> 32:37.017
You gotta move on, Caleb.

32:37.084 --> 32:39.619
Caleb, do you remember
what you said to me?

32:39.686 --> 32:41.387
You said if you loved a girl,

32:41.454 --> 32:43.022
<i>you'd fight for her.</i>

32:43.089 --> 32:45.257
<i>You'd go down fighting for her.</i>
<i>Do you remember that?</i>

32:45.325 --> 32:46.325
Ty: <i>He said that?</i>
- <i>What?</i> <i>Caleb, no!</i>

32:46.393 --> 32:47.626
That's not the path
to take-

32:47.693 --> 32:49.228
Yes, it is, Caleb!

32:50.330 --> 32:52.531
You love Ashley, right?

32:52.598 --> 32:54.266
So what're you gonna do, hmm?

32:55.168 --> 32:56.235
I'm gonna fight for her.

32:56.302 --> 32:57.235
Yeah. That's right!

32:57.302 --> 32:58.469
No, it's not!

32:58.537 --> 32:59.970
I'm going to Vancouver,

33:00.039 --> 33:02.073
and I'm gonna fight for Ashley.

33:02.141 --> 33:03.508
But uh...

33:03.575 --> 33:05.676
I'm gonna lay down
for a little while, first.

33:15.420 --> 33:16.686
(Snorting softly)

33:18.289 --> 33:19.956
You ate all your breakfast.

33:20.024 --> 33:21.391
That's a good boy.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.161
<i>(Sighs)</i>

33:24.228 --> 33:25.962
I touched your neck, didn't I?

33:26.030 --> 33:29.098
Where they gave you injections.

33:29.166 --> 33:30.466
I'm sorry, I should have known

33:30.534 --> 33:33.001
that's what you didn't like.

33:34.037 --> 33:36.205
I bet you hate being
cooped up in here, don't you?

33:37.307 --> 33:38.707
<i>You like to run.</i>

33:40.743 --> 33:42.945
Okay.

33:43.012 --> 33:44.180
All right, let's do it.

33:45.114 --> 33:47.348
I know I agreed
to this house building

33:47.416 --> 33:49.016
and I'm not trying
to be difficult...

33:49.085 --> 33:50.718
Well, you sort of are.

33:50.786 --> 33:52.487
We can't build anything
in a day, Lisa.

33:52.555 --> 33:54.322
Well, obviously you can't build
anything in a day, Peter,

33:54.390 --> 33:55.557
I understand that.

33:55.624 --> 33:57.425
But surely the two of you
see the effect

33:57.493 --> 33:58.926
that this is gonna have
on our bottom line.

33:58.994 --> 34:00.428
But you knew about this.

34:00.496 --> 34:02.028
I mean, we talked
about these plans

34:02.097 --> 34:03.163
and you agreed to them.

34:03.231 --> 34:04.631
You can't just--

34:04.699 --> 34:05.732
Okay, look, we understand
that it's one thing

34:05.800 --> 34:07.167
to talk about something

34:07.235 --> 34:09.103
and another thing to see
it happening, but...

34:09.170 --> 34:10.670
Yes, this will cause
some upheaval--

34:10.737 --> 34:12.739
Just a bit!?

34:12.806 --> 34:13.873
Look, can I be honest?

34:13.940 --> 34:16.342
I'm very caught up
in my new venture

34:16.411 --> 34:17.876
and I don't have a lot of time

34:17.944 --> 34:19.145
for all of this nonsense,

34:19.213 --> 34:22.514
so why don't we consider
you buying me out.

34:22.583 --> 34:25.585
Jack: Oh, come on,
Lisa, you can't...

34:28.088 --> 34:29.422
You took on a responsibility

34:29.489 --> 34:31.190
when you bought into
that dude ranch.

34:31.257 --> 34:32.658
<i>You can't just pawn it off</i>

34:32.726 --> 34:34.391
<i>because you happen to be</i>
<i>following some whim</i>

34:34.460 --> 34:35.793
with your ex-husband.

34:35.860 --> 34:36.928
A whim?

34:36.996 --> 34:38.263
Well, what would you call it?

34:38.331 --> 34:40.063
I'd call it a business decision,
Jack.

34:40.132 --> 34:41.132
Is that so?

34:41.199 --> 34:42.367
<i>Lisa:</i>
<i>Yes, that's so.</i>

34:42.435 --> 34:43.534
Well, I don't know
that it's business

34:43.603 --> 34:45.203
as much as it is personal.

34:45.271 --> 34:47.739
(Clears throat)
Okay, do you two need a moment?

34:47.806 --> 34:49.139
Personal?!

34:49.206 --> 34:50.574
What are you talking about?

34:50.641 --> 34:53.777
I saw you kissing him!
I saw you kissing him!

34:53.844 --> 34:54.911
Lou:
Yeah. Okay.

34:58.617 --> 34:59.916
I can't believe you're jealous!

34:59.984 --> 35:01.885
Jealous?
I am not jealous.

35:01.953 --> 35:03.654
It was Dan, Jack!

35:03.721 --> 35:05.321
Yes, he kissed me,
I can't deny that.

35:05.389 --> 35:08.691
But what you saw was a rusty,
old ex-husband kiss.

35:08.759 --> 35:10.860
It wasn't
a mean-something kiss.

35:12.596 --> 35:13.963
Honestly.

35:20.937 --> 35:23.938
That's a mean-something
kiss.

35:30.046 --> 35:31.112
(Wincing in pain)

35:32.549 --> 35:34.049
What are you doing?

35:34.116 --> 35:35.917
Amy:
What grandpa told me to do.

35:35.985 --> 35:37.152
I'm letting him out.

35:37.219 --> 35:39.387
Look, this horse needs to run.

35:39.454 --> 35:40.655
I know Scott said
that he's better

35:40.722 --> 35:41.922
left in a stall,

35:41.990 --> 35:45.393
but he needs to get
some of his energy out.

35:45.460 --> 35:47.695
Ty, look, I understand

35:47.762 --> 35:50.164
that you don't agree
with any of this,

35:50.232 --> 35:53.966
and I know you're
worried about me.

35:54.034 --> 35:57.637
And I get that,
and I respect that.

35:59.840 --> 36:03.343
But I need you
to let me do this.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.412
I said I would help you,

36:05.479 --> 36:07.013
so I will.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.348
Okay.

36:11.751 --> 36:13.819
(Grunting)

36:23.161 --> 36:25.296
Amy:
(Whistles and clicks teeth)

36:25.364 --> 36:26.431
Psst! Ha!

36:28.900 --> 36:29.967
Get up!

36:30.035 --> 36:31.102
(Whistles)

36:34.339 --> 36:35.405
Yah!

36:39.043 --> 36:40.577
Come on.

36:40.645 --> 36:42.112
(Clicks teeth)

36:42.179 --> 36:44.080
Get up!

36:44.148 --> 36:45.181
(Clicks teeth)

36:46.284 --> 36:47.351
(Sighs)

36:48.986 --> 36:50.185
<i>I thought he'd wanna run,</i>

36:50.254 --> 36:51.186
but it's like
he's totally depressed

36:51.255 --> 36:52.321
or something.

36:54.791 --> 36:55.725
(Whinnies)

36:55.792 --> 36:57.826
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Amy! Amy!</i>

37:05.601 --> 37:08.002
She won't even listen to me.

37:08.937 --> 37:11.740
She's already
getting ready to leave.

37:11.807 --> 37:13.941
I just don't want to go.

37:14.009 --> 37:17.078
Well, you can always come back.

37:17.146 --> 37:20.782
Give her time
to think it over a bit.

37:22.216 --> 37:23.484
What were you thinking
posting that stuff

37:23.551 --> 37:24.951
on Facebook?

37:28.222 --> 37:29.956
Shane, get in the car,
we're leaving.

37:39.733 --> 37:41.033
There's only a couple of weeks
left of the summer.

37:41.101 --> 37:42.802
Why don't you
just let him stay?

37:42.869 --> 37:43.936
No.

37:44.004 --> 37:45.471
It's done way more harm
than good.

37:48.241 --> 37:50.310
And just so we're clear...

37:50.377 --> 37:52.945
<i>I told Jack, once,</i>
<i>I couldn't compete...</i>

37:53.013 --> 37:55.514
With this -
all of this -

37:57.850 --> 37:59.083
and I can't.

37:59.985 --> 38:01.653
And if I keep letting him
come here,

38:01.721 --> 38:04.255
I'm just gonna lose him.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.926
Lose him.
What're you talking about?

38:07.993 --> 38:09.127
Do you have any idea
what he's like

38:09.195 --> 38:12.029
when he comes home
after a visit?

38:12.096 --> 38:14.598
<i>It's like he's goes</i>
<i>cold turkey.</i>

38:15.534 --> 38:19.437
So I think it's best
if we just make a clean break.

38:21.540 --> 38:22.540
A clean break.

38:22.607 --> 38:25.175
Yeah.

38:25.243 --> 38:28.044
I don't think you should have
any more contact with him.

38:32.049 --> 38:35.318
He's my son.

38:35.386 --> 38:37.053
I can see him whenever I want.

38:37.120 --> 38:40.390
You don't have that right, Tim.

38:40.458 --> 38:41.690
You haven't earned it.

38:45.362 --> 38:46.595
Tim:
Miranda!

38:46.663 --> 38:47.996
Miranda:
Shane, get in the car.

38:48.064 --> 38:49.130
Miranda!

38:58.807 --> 39:00.541
Oh... come here.

39:02.077 --> 39:05.513
It's okay. Okay?
We'll work it out.

39:05.581 --> 39:06.514
You gotta go with your mom.

39:06.582 --> 39:08.683
Just... you have to.

39:09.785 --> 39:11.185
- Dad...
- Oh, come on.

39:11.253 --> 39:13.354
You gotta go, I mean it.

(Engine starts)

39:35.809 --> 39:36.842
(Sighs)

39:55.394 --> 39:58.062
It's been kind of a day.

40:01.033 --> 40:02.132
Yeah.

(Snorting and stamping)

40:14.011 --> 40:17.047

against stall)

40:23.854 --> 40:27.389
Fine! Fine.
You want out?!

40:29.693 --> 40:30.760
Go on!

40:33.129 --> 40:34.362
(Hooves thud)

40:44.239 --> 40:46.140
What's going on?

40:47.309 --> 40:48.710
I give up.

40:48.778 --> 40:50.478
You were right,
Grandpa was right.

40:50.545 --> 40:52.112
There's no fixing him.

And I understand that it's,
you know,

41:57.175 --> 41:59.076
an elemental cave man need

41:59.144 --> 42:01.345
to put a roof
over your family's head.

42:01.412 --> 42:03.380
Cave man... what?

42:03.448 --> 42:05.482
But we do have to, you know,

42:05.550 --> 42:07.350
consider what Lisa was saying.

42:07.417 --> 42:09.252
It's gonna be bad for business.

42:09.319 --> 42:11.020
You know, people stay at the
dude ranch (Phone chimes)

42:11.088 --> 42:12.355
for peace and quiet

42:12.422 --> 42:15.158

isn't exactly peaceful

42:15.226 --> 42:16.626
or quiet.

42:16.693 --> 42:18.194
- I know.
- So...

42:18.262 --> 42:19.929
Honey, can you listen to me,
please?

42:19.997 --> 42:21.397
Sorry.
I have to check this.

Okay.

A consulting job -
a really good one.

42:34.077 --> 42:35.010
- What?
- Yeah.

42:35.078 --> 42:36.812
(Laughing)

42:36.880 --> 42:38.313
Honey, that is great!

42:38.381 --> 42:39.747
Yes. There's one
small glitch...

42:39.815 --> 42:40.748
What?

42:40.816 --> 42:42.784
Um...
It's in Vancouver.

42:42.851 --> 42:44.285
- Vancouver?
- Yes.

42:44.352 --> 42:46.086
But Vancouver
is not so bad, right?

42:46.154 --> 42:48.689
It's like an hour flight away.

42:48.757 --> 42:49.623
Right.

42:49.691 --> 42:51.692
We can deal with that.

42:51.760 --> 42:52.826
Yes!

42:59.301 --> 43:01.134
Lisa:
Got your message.

43:01.202 --> 43:02.268
Here I am.

43:03.203 --> 43:04.404
Jack:
And here I am...

43:05.372 --> 43:07.039
Apologizing.

43:07.107 --> 43:08.608
I was an idiot.

43:08.676 --> 43:09.576
Mm-hm.
(Laughing)

43:09.676 --> 43:10.576
You were.

43:17.617 --> 43:19.785
Now that's
a mean-something kiss.

43:19.852 --> 43:20.819
(Laughs)

43:20.886 --> 43:22.187
I hope you know that.

43:22.254 --> 43:23.522
You know, people are
gonna start thinking

43:23.589 --> 43:26.191
you just make a habit
of kissing random guys

43:26.258 --> 43:27.859
in the middle of town.

43:27.927 --> 43:29.994
