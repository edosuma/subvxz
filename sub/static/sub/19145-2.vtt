WEBVTT

00:00.578 --> 00:02.667
Previously on Cardinal...

00:02.695 --> 00:03.844
They found a body.

00:03.930 --> 00:05.422
It's not my department anymore.

00:05.445 --> 00:06.590
It's a child.

00:06.813 --> 00:08.278
They think it might be her.

00:08.587 --> 00:11.125
We're gonna throw everything
we have at this, Dorothy.

00:11.282 --> 00:12.889
You said that before.

00:13.312 --> 00:14.436
Then you gave up.

00:14.452 --> 00:16.024
If I make you the lead on this,

00:16.056 --> 00:18.288
I need to know that
you're not gonna drift.

00:18.525 --> 00:19.849
Now her right eye,

00:20.133 --> 00:21.178
four abrasions,

00:21.179 --> 00:22.413
two upper, two lower.

00:22.414 --> 00:23.890
They could be from a speculum

00:23.898 --> 00:25.108
to keep her eyes open.

00:25.671 --> 00:28.110
Katie Pine wasn't this
guy's first victim.

00:28.186 --> 00:29.210
He stalked her.

00:29.218 --> 00:31.026
And who does that?

00:31.179 --> 00:32.219
A repeater.

00:32.718 --> 00:34.435
I should come home.

00:35.023 --> 00:36.242
Catherine.

00:38.533 --> 00:40.466
Why so much this time?

00:44.129 --> 00:45.331
I mean, there's a rumour

00:45.332 --> 00:46.925
our department's under investigation.

00:46.949 --> 00:48.430
It's gotta be a dirty cop

00:48.436 --> 00:49.725
or we'd handle it internally.

00:49.858 --> 00:51.545
You'll know the name Kyle Corbett,

00:51.584 --> 00:53.809
controls the bulk of the
drug trade north of Toronto.

00:53.817 --> 00:56.778
Someone from our side is
feeding Corbett information.

00:56.817 --> 00:58.410
Find the link

00:58.504 --> 01:00.458
between Cardinal and Corbett.

02:10.788 --> 02:12.868
Listen, we don't know
Cardinal's done anything wrong.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.760
That's right.

02:17.236 --> 02:18.595
If he's dirty,

02:18.629 --> 02:20.163
I'm not getting in your way

02:20.198 --> 02:21.759
but right now,

02:21.807 --> 02:23.181
this nightmare...

02:24.409 --> 02:26.911
whatever else Musgrave has you doing,

02:26.945 --> 02:27.945
this is your priority.

02:28.881 --> 02:29.881
Clear?

02:37.322 --> 02:39.780
I need to go to Toronto for the autopsy.

02:40.292 --> 02:41.292
I'll come with you.

02:41.727 --> 02:42.727
It's not necessary.

02:44.162 --> 02:45.162
You've been up all night.

02:46.064 --> 02:47.064
You could use a co-pilot.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.104
We leave in half an hour.

02:53.572 --> 02:54.538
Okay.

02:54.573 --> 02:55.573
What do I tell your mom?

02:55.607 --> 02:56.607
She keeps calling.

02:57.142 --> 02:58.109
I can't go.

02:58.143 --> 02:59.377
I won't be back in time.

02:59.411 --> 03:01.245
All right. Just the
whole clan will be there.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.246
She made that clear.

03:02.281 --> 03:03.119
All the cousins.

03:03.144 --> 03:04.248
I know.

03:04.283 --> 03:06.117
Sugar shack, sing-alongs, mulled wine.

03:08.954 --> 03:10.154
We don't drink mulled wine.

03:12.491 --> 03:13.691
So what do I tell her?

03:14.660 --> 03:15.660
Tell her

03:15.994 --> 03:17.929
someone's murdering children.

03:17.954 --> 03:19.992
It's my job to stop them.

03:20.026 --> 03:21.432
Busy at work.

03:21.466 --> 03:22.466
I'll let her know.

03:25.437 --> 03:27.438
Since when do you want to see my family?

03:27.472 --> 03:28.906
I don't know. It's been a while.

03:28.941 --> 03:30.408
It might do you some good.

03:30.442 --> 03:32.276
- Me?
- And me. Us.

03:34.279 --> 03:36.119
Speaking of which,
shouldn't we know something?

03:38.150 --> 03:39.150
Sorry.

03:40.052 --> 03:42.153
I-I should have told you.

03:42.187 --> 03:43.187
Um, no.

03:44.356 --> 03:45.790
No. I found out a couple days ago.

03:47.693 --> 03:48.693
So we keep trying.

03:51.196 --> 03:54.098
As tortuous as that process is for me.

03:57.836 --> 04:00.037
It's not mulled wine.

04:00.072 --> 04:01.072
It's got whiskey in it.

04:02.564 --> 04:03.641
It's called caribou.

04:06.645 --> 04:08.446
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.355
So your daughter lives
in Toronto, right?

04:21.593 --> 04:22.560
That's gotta be hard,

04:22.594 --> 04:23.828
being so far apart.

04:23.862 --> 04:24.829
She grew up there.

04:24.863 --> 04:25.863
She wanted to stay.

04:27.532 --> 04:28.532
You didn't?

04:29.868 --> 04:31.249
Algonquin Bay's my home.

04:33.171 --> 04:34.839
Yeah but I mean you spent, what,

04:34.873 --> 04:37.074
ten years over there.

04:37.109 --> 04:38.909
Decorated big city detective.

04:38.944 --> 04:40.054
That's a lot to leave behind.

04:40.078 --> 04:41.078
It was easy.

04:46.585 --> 04:47.585
What does your wife do?

04:51.890 --> 04:53.891
Hey. If you don't
want to talk, suits me.

04:56.228 --> 04:58.229
Or I could tell you what
day Katie Pine was killed.

05:02.801 --> 05:04.935
I was thinking about it last night.

05:04.970 --> 05:07.538
The coroner said the petechial
hemorrhaging was preserved

05:07.572 --> 05:09.240
because the tissue was frozen

05:09.274 --> 05:11.609
but we know from the melt water that

05:11.643 --> 05:14.211
it was above zero when Katie was dumped.

05:14.246 --> 05:17.248
So it must have snapped
cold soon after within

05:17.282 --> 05:20.618
three days or the tissue
would have degraded.

05:20.652 --> 05:23.421
I checked the weather
records starting October 29th,

05:23.455 --> 05:25.689
the date she went missing.

05:25.724 --> 05:29.034
It dropped below freezing
on the eleventh of November.

05:31.630 --> 05:33.760
So sometime between the
eighth and the eleventh

05:35.333 --> 05:37.544
Katie was killed and dumped.

05:40.405 --> 05:42.433
He had her a week before he killed her.

05:54.152 --> 05:55.352
Are both your parents French?

05:56.588 --> 05:57.588
Interesting.

06:00.292 --> 06:01.592
Rule of thumb.

06:01.626 --> 06:04.662
If I ask a guy five questions
before he asks one back,

06:05.597 --> 06:06.564
well then he's a douche

06:06.598 --> 06:08.926
and you just squeaked in under the wire.

06:14.506 --> 06:16.136
What is your rule about answering?

06:18.343 --> 06:19.343
Both French.

06:22.047 --> 06:23.514
You want a coffee?

06:23.548 --> 06:24.548
Yeah, black.

06:25.617 --> 06:26.617
There.

06:26.985 --> 06:28.345
That's two questions that I asked.

07:08.369 --> 07:10.194
I forgot money.

07:12.397 --> 07:13.397
Yeah, right.

07:35.187 --> 07:36.253
Lise Delorme,

07:36.288 --> 07:37.755
Dr. Len Torres.

07:37.789 --> 07:38.789
Nice to meet you.

07:39.791 --> 07:40.791
What happened there?

07:42.294 --> 07:43.661
I was fixing a frozen pipe

07:43.695 --> 07:45.327
and I smacked my head.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.401
This way. They're just pulling up.

07:53.271 --> 07:55.439
You know that's not an
issue anymore, right?

07:55.473 --> 07:56.740
Frozen pipes?

07:56.775 --> 07:59.076
Something the modern world has solved.

07:59.110 --> 08:00.244
I had a raccoon

08:00.278 --> 08:02.793
in my crawl space and it
tore out the insulation.

08:04.496 --> 08:06.584
Now you're just making my point for me.

08:31.643 --> 08:33.043
We leave them wrapped

08:33.078 --> 08:35.645
so we catch anything that
might still be in the material,

08:35.679 --> 08:36.647
bullet fragments,

08:36.681 --> 08:38.048
weapons.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.316
This is Dr. Torres.

08:39.351 --> 08:42.586
Preliminary scan of subject 20089.

08:42.621 --> 08:44.755
Multiple fractures to the seventh,

08:44.789 --> 08:47.725
fifth and fourth ribs.

08:47.759 --> 08:50.894
Fractures of the ulna
and the wrist bone.

08:50.929 --> 08:52.563
They look like defensive wounds.

08:52.597 --> 08:53.597
Did you get this?

08:55.300 --> 08:57.389
Open fracture to the left collarbone.

09:01.940 --> 09:04.174
Foreign objects

09:04.209 --> 09:05.309
entering the parietal bone,

09:05.343 --> 09:08.512
penetrating clear down
and out the temporal.

09:10.427 --> 09:12.419
Blunt force trauma to the skull.

09:12.784 --> 09:14.018
Multiple blows.

09:16.971 --> 09:18.122
What is this?

09:22.494 --> 09:23.894
Your guess is as good as mine.

09:27.630 --> 09:28.699
You okay?

09:29.134 --> 09:30.134
Yeah.

09:31.736 --> 09:33.837
It gets worse from here.

09:35.640 --> 09:36.640
I'll be fine.

09:52.815 --> 09:56.393
Lacerations on the thigh and
upper leg on the right side.

09:56.428 --> 09:59.730
Could be the work of
pliers or wire cutters.

09:59.764 --> 10:01.532
Some of this was frenzy violence but

10:01.566 --> 10:03.528
some if it was purposeful.

10:03.568 --> 10:04.568
He was experimenting.

10:15.719 --> 10:16.780
A spike in his head,

10:17.549 --> 10:18.549
pounded in, broken off.

10:22.420 --> 10:23.420
Excuse me.

10:40.438 --> 10:41.438
Audio tape.

10:58.473 --> 11:00.141
My first time here

11:00.175 --> 11:02.176
was a subway jumper,

11:02.211 --> 11:03.211
woman in her fifties.

11:05.013 --> 11:06.013
She got

11:06.481 --> 11:09.617
corkscrewed up under the wheels.

11:09.651 --> 11:10.618
Legs backward,

11:10.652 --> 11:14.622
her whole side sheared off.

11:14.656 --> 11:16.490
Are you trying to settle my stomach?

11:18.695 --> 11:21.963
I gutted my way through
the autopsy like a champion

11:21.997 --> 11:22.997
until

11:25.334 --> 11:26.734
we found a piece of litter,

11:28.837 --> 11:32.039
one of those orange juice caps that

11:32.074 --> 11:33.908
pops when you, when you open it.

11:36.178 --> 11:37.979
It had been

11:38.013 --> 11:41.054
driven through her cheek

11:41.984 --> 11:45.486
so it was half in, half...

11:45.520 --> 11:46.520
half out of her mouth.

11:49.797 --> 11:51.659
And that's, that's when I lost it.

11:54.229 --> 11:56.063
Then you got sick?

11:56.098 --> 11:57.531
I passed out,

11:57.566 --> 11:59.066
hit the floor.

11:59.101 --> 12:00.101
You didn't.

12:00.736 --> 12:01.869
Ask Len.

12:01.904 --> 12:03.371
Woke up with him

12:03.405 --> 12:04.445
flicking water in my face.

12:10.178 --> 12:13.347
Listen. We can't do
the internal work,

12:13.382 --> 12:16.584
until the body's thawed so you
should go back to the hotel and

12:16.618 --> 12:18.052
get some sleep.

12:18.086 --> 12:19.086
And what about you?

12:20.088 --> 12:21.088
I

12:22.224 --> 12:23.903
Daughter hotline.

12:24.793 --> 12:27.795
She's-she's found some
time in her busy schedule.

12:39.035 --> 12:41.208
Are you here to see me or a dead body?

12:41.710 --> 12:42.710
Why not both?

12:44.079 --> 12:45.913
Hi.

12:48.050 --> 12:49.583
Let's have a look.

12:49.618 --> 12:50.685
Can we not here? Really?

12:50.719 --> 12:51.919
Let me see. Let me see.

12:58.427 --> 12:59.427
Happy?

13:00.295 --> 13:01.295
I'm fine. Seriously.

13:03.598 --> 13:04.598
You hungry?

13:04.633 --> 13:05.633
Yeah.

13:06.802 --> 13:08.636
When do you think she'll get out?

13:08.670 --> 13:09.804
Soon.

13:09.838 --> 13:10.805
You don't,

13:10.839 --> 13:12.940
you don't need to worry about that.

13:12.975 --> 13:14.642
You know, she was feeling,

13:14.676 --> 13:16.744
a little out of balance
but she caught it in time.

13:16.778 --> 13:18.779
We're just-we're just being careful.

13:20.415 --> 13:22.383
She called me, you know.

13:22.417 --> 13:25.052
A couple weeks ago before she went in.

13:25.087 --> 13:26.831
She called the school
in the middle of the day

13:26.855 --> 13:28.923
and they pulled me out of class.

13:28.957 --> 13:31.459
Thought it was an emergency but

13:31.493 --> 13:34.962
she just wanted to talk
about plans for the spring,

13:34.997 --> 13:37.631
a hike she wanted to take and

13:37.666 --> 13:39.632
some mural she wants to paint?

13:40.469 --> 13:41.669
She was all over the place.

13:44.506 --> 13:46.340
I should have known
that she was in trouble.

13:47.542 --> 13:49.477
That's not her.

13:49.511 --> 13:50.511
Yeah, I know.

13:51.847 --> 13:53.447
She won't even remember making the call.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.098
I don't know how you stay so patient.

14:02.524 --> 14:04.458
They got something off the audio tape.

14:04.493 --> 14:05.493
I'll pick you up.

14:11.233 --> 14:12.466
Is that your new partner?

14:13.668 --> 14:14.668
Yeah.

14:15.670 --> 14:16.670
Dad, she's hot.

14:17.906 --> 14:19.840
That's... she's-she's-

14:19.875 --> 14:20.875
Hi.

14:23.311 --> 14:26.313
Kelly, this is Delorme.

14:26.848 --> 14:29.016
- Lise.
- Lise. Nice to meet you.

14:29.051 --> 14:30.051
My pleasure.

14:31.420 --> 14:32.453
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:32.487 --> 14:33.487
Bye.

14:35.802 --> 14:37.358
Hey, you should start running again.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.560
Why?

14:40.595 --> 14:41.595
'Cause you like it.

14:43.999 --> 14:44.999
Okay bye.

14:48.236 --> 14:49.636
There's a male's voice on the tape.

14:51.039 --> 14:52.119
They think it's the killer.

14:53.542 --> 14:54.742
Why do they think that?

14:56.545 --> 14:58.179
There's a young girl's voice too.

15:10.192 --> 15:11.192
He's taking pictures.

15:12.394 --> 15:13.994
An SLR. Film.

15:14.029 --> 15:15.029
Not digital.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.700
Please.

15:28.210 --> 15:29.490
What is that? What's that noise?

15:31.379 --> 15:32.580
Just let me go.

15:33.915 --> 15:35.116
Look at me, Katie.

15:36.218 --> 15:37.418
Look right here.

15:37.986 --> 15:39.420
Please don't...

15:39.454 --> 15:40.654
trying to be nice.

15:47.896 --> 15:48.896
That's all we got.

15:53.235 --> 15:54.235
It gives us his voice.

15:55.937 --> 15:56.937
It connects the killings.

15:59.341 --> 16:00.341
Why would he do that?

16:04.179 --> 16:05.179
Maybe a mistake.

16:05.347 --> 16:06.627
He didn't think we'd recover it.

16:10.785 --> 16:11.785
Or he's escalating.

16:12.821 --> 16:13.821
He wants to flaunt it.

16:22.664 --> 16:24.498
My wife has bipolar disorder.

16:26.768 --> 16:27.868
That's why we moved back.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.783
I thought the slower pace
would be good for her.

16:32.107 --> 16:33.357
You were asking before.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.777
I'm sorry. I had no idea that-

17:47.082 --> 17:48.649
When Todd Curry went missing,

17:48.683 --> 17:50.985
he said he was going to visit his uncle

17:51.019 --> 17:52.753
but the uncle down in Hamilton said

17:52.787 --> 17:54.154
there was no such arrangement,

17:54.189 --> 17:55.921
hadn't talked to Curry in months.

17:57.726 --> 17:58.810
Why the lie?

17:58.841 --> 18:01.061
The officer in charge
was Detective Peters.

18:01.096 --> 18:03.097
If he knows then he didn't
put it in his report.

18:07.902 --> 18:08.902
We'll have to ask him.

18:10.205 --> 18:11.672
He was classic runaway material.

18:11.706 --> 18:13.741
I mean, drugs,

18:13.775 --> 18:14.742
troubles in school,

18:14.776 --> 18:16.043
no mom in the house.

18:16.077 --> 18:17.288
Yeah but if you're running away,

18:17.312 --> 18:18.693
why make up a story?

18:20.842 --> 18:22.053
How do you mean?

18:23.118 --> 18:25.886
The cover story about
going to his uncle's.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.122
If the plan is not to come back,

18:28.156 --> 18:29.267
you don't need a cover story.

18:29.291 --> 18:30.291
You just go.

18:30.825 --> 18:32.416
Tell me your name again.

18:34.296 --> 18:35.296
Lise Delorme.

18:36.164 --> 18:37.865
Well Lise,

18:37.899 --> 18:40.301
maybe he wanted to buy some
time to get out of town.

18:42.270 --> 18:43.404
Yeah.

18:43.438 --> 18:45.739
Or maybe he wasn't planning
on being gone for long

18:45.774 --> 18:47.708
but he was doing something
he wasn't supposed to

18:47.742 --> 18:48.742
so he lied.

18:50.578 --> 18:51.578
What were his interests?

18:51.946 --> 18:52.913
Concert in Toronto?

18:52.947 --> 18:53.947
Out of town girlfriend?

18:56.151 --> 18:58.527
Lucky for everyone involved
you're on the case now.

19:06.995 --> 19:09.997
Detective Peters didn't
have any details about

19:10.031 --> 19:11.031
how Todd was killed.

19:12.967 --> 19:14.904
Well we're just learning that.

19:16.671 --> 19:17.971
Yep, but I mean,

19:18.006 --> 19:19.440
you must have some indication.

19:19.474 --> 19:21.154
You're-you're the one
who found him, right?

19:22.510 --> 19:23.510
Yes.

19:25.046 --> 19:27.527
Detective, don't make
me fill in the blanks.

19:32.187 --> 19:34.295
Early indications are that your son

19:37.459 --> 19:39.432
was harmed before he died.

19:41.229 --> 19:42.721
What does that mean? Harmed?

19:45.834 --> 19:46.834
There are signs that...

19:51.206 --> 19:52.206
Mr. Curry,

19:53.742 --> 19:54.808
it's easy to believe

19:54.843 --> 19:58.645
that these details will
help you to move forward but

19:58.680 --> 19:59.847
that's not always the case.

19:59.881 --> 20:01.227
That's not for you to decide.

20:03.752 --> 20:06.620
I'm just suggesting
that until we know more,

20:06.654 --> 20:08.522
- you take the time...
- Listen to me.

20:08.556 --> 20:09.757
You tell me what you know.

20:10.992 --> 20:11.992
You tell me right now.

20:13.395 --> 20:14.395
He was tortured

20:16.852 --> 20:17.898
and beaten

20:18.933 --> 20:19.933
and degraded.

20:25.707 --> 20:27.674
We don't know the precise cause of death

20:27.709 --> 20:30.598
because your son
received so many injuries.

20:42.791 --> 20:44.024
If you're taking off for good,

20:46.227 --> 20:47.227
you bring your laptop.

20:49.898 --> 20:52.833
I'm telling you this
kid didn't run away;

20:52.867 --> 20:53.867
He went to do something.

20:54.903 --> 20:55.903
Or meet someone.

20:57.739 --> 20:58.739
Pack it up. Yeah.

21:03.578 --> 21:04.578
Thanks.

21:05.647 --> 21:07.080
I used to be good at that,

21:08.716 --> 21:10.390
talking to people about their dead.

21:43.651 --> 21:46.386
The killer got Katie
Pine out to Windigo Island

21:46.421 --> 21:47.788
before the lake froze.

21:47.822 --> 21:49.122
So Hannam,

21:49.157 --> 21:50.891
check the marinas, all right?

21:50.925 --> 21:51.892
Maybe he owns a boat.

21:51.926 --> 21:52.926
More likely

21:52.951 --> 21:54.328
he wouldn't use his own so,

21:54.362 --> 21:56.763
something stolen, rentals.

21:56.798 --> 21:58.298
Ask around see what pops up.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.333
McLeod,

22:00.301 --> 22:03.337
pathology reports on Pine and Curry.

22:03.371 --> 22:06.106
I want you to handle ViCLAS personally.

22:06.140 --> 22:07.474
Compare it to past cases,

22:07.509 --> 22:09.142
anything with a torture element.

22:09.177 --> 22:10.611
Start provincial then widen out,

22:10.645 --> 22:11.986
going back twenty years.

22:12.714 --> 22:13.714
Twenty?

22:13.815 --> 22:14.848
Twenty.

22:14.883 --> 22:17.484
This guy's tech is
old so maybe he is too.

22:17.519 --> 22:19.420
Could be this isn't his first foray.

22:21.222 --> 22:22.189
Last piece.

22:22.223 --> 22:24.124
The audio guys pulled more detail

22:24.158 --> 22:25.792
out of the Katie Pine tape.

22:25.827 --> 22:27.261
They've isolated the chirping

22:27.295 --> 22:29.763
of a seeing impaired traffic signal.

22:29.797 --> 22:31.632
Delorme and I are on that.

22:31.666 --> 22:32.666
Now listen,

22:33.401 --> 22:34.668
two victims,

22:34.702 --> 22:36.169
one from out of town,

22:36.204 --> 22:37.437
one local,

22:37.472 --> 22:38.816
no indication they knew each other,

22:38.840 --> 22:40.674
but somehow they were chosen.

22:41.843 --> 22:42.809
Right?

22:42.844 --> 22:44.678
So no clue too small.

22:44.712 --> 22:45.956
Anywhere these kids might have gone,

22:45.980 --> 22:47.681
anyone they might have talked to,

22:47.715 --> 22:48.682
let's write it down,

22:48.716 --> 22:49.783
stick it on the board

22:49.817 --> 22:51.952
so we can find some crossover.

22:51.986 --> 22:52.986
Late night, Fox?

22:53.885 --> 22:57.291
Sorry sir. Kid's got croup.

22:57.325 --> 22:58.926
Yeah. Well keep it in here.

23:00.562 --> 23:02.195
And that goes for the rest of us.

23:03.097 --> 23:04.865
All right? Out there,

23:04.899 --> 23:06.166
no yawning, no laughing,

23:06.200 --> 23:07.989
no checking Facebook on your break.

23:09.904 --> 23:11.204
These people are grieving

23:11.239 --> 23:12.539
and they're scared

23:12.574 --> 23:13.980
and they're looking to us.

23:16.544 --> 23:18.211
So let's be the cops they need to see.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.106
I need you to go downtown

23:28.140 --> 23:30.875
and get a map of all the
seeing impaired traffic signals.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.477
Yeah.

23:32.511 --> 23:33.511
Lise?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.414
What are you doing here?

23:38.517 --> 23:40.852
I had a meeting in the area.

23:40.886 --> 23:42.766
Thought I'd take a chance,
see if you were free?

23:44.400 --> 23:45.556
I'm on my way out.

23:45.799 --> 23:49.068
Um, Josh, John Cardinal.

23:49.103 --> 23:51.065
The new partner.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.940
I gotta say I had a
different picture in my mind.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.008
Yeah?

23:55.042 --> 23:56.553
Lise said that you seemed
older than your years,

23:56.577 --> 23:59.045
but I don't know, you
don't look that old.

23:59.079 --> 24:00.079
Cheers.

24:01.882 --> 24:03.716
I'll walk you out.
I'll just grab my coat.

24:09.150 --> 24:10.423
Yeah. I used to come

24:10.457 --> 24:11.858
visit her at work all the time

24:11.892 --> 24:13.359
when we first started dating.

24:13.394 --> 24:14.771
Yeah. I'd bring her
lunches, like hot lunches

24:14.795 --> 24:15.862
in those tiffin carriers.

24:15.896 --> 24:16.863
- You know those things?
- No.

24:16.897 --> 24:17.974
Like the-like those stacking,

24:17.998 --> 24:19.432
like metal tins from India? No?

24:21.268 --> 24:23.036
Well, I-I was learning how to cook

24:23.070 --> 24:24.070
and she's my best client.

24:24.638 --> 24:25.638
You're a,

24:26.273 --> 24:27.407
a chef?

24:27.441 --> 24:28.408
No, no, no, no.

24:28.442 --> 24:29.442
Hydrologist.

24:31.111 --> 24:33.046
So how'd you end up partners anyway?

24:33.080 --> 24:34.714
Did you decide that?

24:34.748 --> 24:36.481
No. That,

24:36.617 --> 24:37.832
that comes from above.

24:40.854 --> 24:41.854
Nice meeting you, John.

24:42.823 --> 24:43.823
And you.

24:53.133 --> 24:54.734
I noticed him when I was cooking dinner.

24:54.768 --> 24:55.768
Didn't think much of it

24:55.803 --> 24:57.503
but then I looked half an hour later,

24:57.538 --> 24:59.105
he was still standing here.

24:59.139 --> 25:00.139
Where exactly?

25:00.507 --> 25:01.507
Right there.

25:01.542 --> 25:02.542
Right about there.

25:03.811 --> 25:04.777
That's when I realized

25:04.812 --> 25:06.946
he was staring into Dorothy's window.

25:06.980 --> 25:08.448
I didn't want to worry her with it

25:08.482 --> 25:10.362
but I thought with
everything I should call you.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.754
Did you get a look at his face?

25:14.788 --> 25:15.755
When I came out,

25:15.789 --> 25:17.323
he got on his machine and took off.

25:17.357 --> 25:18.640
He was pulling a sled.

25:20.360 --> 25:21.360
Should we tell Dorothy?

25:28.569 --> 25:30.002
I'll take care of it.

25:30.037 --> 25:31.037
Okay. Thank you.

25:37.678 --> 25:39.378
Hey. We're going to grab a bite to eat.

25:39.413 --> 25:40.446
You in?

25:40.481 --> 25:41.681
I can't go until he does.

25:42.584 --> 25:43.983
Well, that could take a while.

25:44.017 --> 25:46.428
Home life can't be real
enticing for him these days.

25:48.388 --> 25:49.956
And you know about that?

25:49.990 --> 25:51.357
Yeah. I was there.

25:51.391 --> 25:53.559
Call came in, ADP down at Memorial,

25:53.594 --> 25:54.794
a couple weeks ago.

25:54.828 --> 25:56.863
I pull up expecting to see
some old lady in a robe,

25:56.897 --> 25:58.498
instead it's Catherine Cardinal.

25:58.532 --> 25:59.499
Nice clothes,

25:59.533 --> 26:00.573
hair brushed but not well.

26:02.389 --> 26:03.703
What kind of not well?

26:05.005 --> 26:06.038
Delusional,

26:06.073 --> 26:07.039
agitated,

26:07.074 --> 26:09.842
not making any sense and,

26:09.877 --> 26:10.877
not happy to see me.

26:12.045 --> 26:13.379
Did you bring her in?

26:13.413 --> 26:14.380
No, are you kidding?

26:14.414 --> 26:15.548
No. I called Cardinal

26:15.582 --> 26:17.917
and I tried to keep her off
the ice till he got there.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.953
He had to put her in a bear
hug to get her in the car.

26:22.389 --> 26:23.389
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

26:25.058 --> 26:27.513
He asked me to keep
this off the books so...

26:29.930 --> 26:31.931
I got a bottle of scotch
out of the deal anyway.

27:14.608 --> 27:15.608
What's this?

27:17.845 --> 27:19.278
Your mom dropped that by.

27:19.646 --> 27:21.647
Yeah, why did my mom
bring us a teddy bear?

27:26.152 --> 27:27.720
I might have let it slip

27:27.754 --> 27:28.754
we're trying.

27:29.089 --> 27:30.489
She was coming at me, Lise.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.268
She was guilting me out
about never visiting.

27:32.292 --> 27:33.469
You know how she is, I panicked.

27:33.493 --> 27:34.927
I just wanted the encounter to end.

27:36.463 --> 27:37.930
Everyone's gonna know now.

27:37.965 --> 27:39.742
Yeah, well is that the
worst thing in the world?

27:39.766 --> 27:41.400
What if it doesn't work?

27:41.435 --> 27:44.303
Now we have to have that
conversation twenty-five times.

27:44.338 --> 27:45.338
It'll work.

27:46.173 --> 27:47.473
This isn't your thing, Josh.

27:47.507 --> 27:49.342
You don't make the
decisions on your own.

27:51.612 --> 27:52.652
Seriously? You're leaving?

27:52.946 --> 27:53.946
Yeah. I need some air.

27:54.781 --> 27:55.781
Dee, come on.

28:10.998 --> 28:12.198
Where you off to, Ronnie?

28:13.400 --> 28:14.400
Hey.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.632
I just keep seeing her face

28:20.340 --> 28:22.136
staring up out of that ice.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.079
I dream about her too.

28:28.982 --> 28:31.017
Except then she's moving and

28:31.051 --> 28:32.251
trying to claw her way out.

28:35.155 --> 28:36.155
Like she's angry.

28:39.359 --> 28:41.661
How's her mom do it, Jerry?

28:41.695 --> 28:43.789
How does she survive a thing like that?

28:46.533 --> 28:48.289
Well, she's already
been through hell, Ron.

28:50.704 --> 28:52.421
You need to respect her space.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.010
I just,

28:58.045 --> 28:59.045
I don't know.

29:01.615 --> 29:04.100
I want to keep an eye on her, you know?

29:06.053 --> 29:07.453
I want to see her live through it.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.708
You've already met Katie's spirit.

29:14.061 --> 29:16.097
You need to honour her other half.

29:18.765 --> 29:19.765
The girl she was.

29:28.018 --> 29:29.608
This is soil

29:29.643 --> 29:30.964
from the fairgrounds,

29:33.246 --> 29:35.162
the last place where she was seen alive.

29:36.450 --> 29:37.650
I want you to keep it.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.219
Go.

30:59.244 --> 31:00.533
Yeah, sorry Sergeant.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.345
I wouldn't have called
if it wasn't important.

31:02.369 --> 31:03.369
Just talk, Delorme.

31:04.638 --> 31:05.604
Well our favourite detective

31:05.639 --> 31:07.640
is running some kind of two a.m. errand

31:08.675 --> 31:09.675
and I'm tailing him.

31:10.343 --> 31:11.477
Why?

31:11.511 --> 31:13.512
I couldn't sleep. I was out driving.

31:13.547 --> 31:14.814
I just saw him go by.

31:14.848 --> 31:15.881
Okay, where are you?

31:15.916 --> 31:18.784
Travelling north on Highway 12.

31:18.819 --> 31:19.899
We just passed Tilden Lake.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.455
He's alone.

31:22.489 --> 31:23.489
What should I do?

31:25.092 --> 31:26.092
Back off.

31:27.360 --> 31:28.404
Stop the car and turn around.

31:28.428 --> 31:29.395
It's too risky.

31:29.429 --> 31:30.663
What?

31:30.697 --> 31:31.874
A single person tailing
a trained detective.

31:31.898 --> 31:32.865
He'll spot you.

31:32.899 --> 31:34.533
You're gonna tank the investigation.

31:36.069 --> 31:37.470
Sergeant.

31:37.504 --> 31:38.714
Stop the car and turn around, Delorme.

31:38.738 --> 31:39.839
Those are your orders.

31:39.873 --> 31:40.873
Yes, sir.

33:36.289 --> 33:37.289
Hi.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.358
The guy who was just here,

33:39.392 --> 33:42.194
he was making eyes at me all night.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.862
Do you see him in here often?

33:43.897 --> 33:45.541
I'm not supposed to
talk about the clientele.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.565
Gotcha.

33:48.201 --> 33:50.669
He kept calling me his lucky charm.

33:50.704 --> 33:52.771
I'm not here to be any arm candy,

33:52.806 --> 33:53.806
I'm here to win.

33:54.341 --> 33:55.341
So just tell me this,

33:56.710 --> 33:58.150
I'm up two thousand dollars tonight.

33:59.713 --> 34:01.547
Is he walking out of
here with more than that?

34:02.849 --> 34:03.882
'Fraid so.

34:03.917 --> 34:04.917
By quite a bit.

34:06.519 --> 34:07.720
Did you want to cash out?

34:09.356 --> 34:10.356
Thanks.

34:22.824 --> 34:24.606
I couldn't have been clearer.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.496
I know, sir. I'm sorry.

34:26.534 --> 34:27.387
I made a call.

34:27.449 --> 34:29.496
Five years of my life I've
been going after Corbett.

34:29.531 --> 34:30.498
When I started

34:30.532 --> 34:31.498
my kid couldn't walk.

34:31.533 --> 34:33.201
- Now she rides a bike.
- I understand.

34:33.235 --> 34:34.502
So for you to just parachute in

34:34.536 --> 34:36.170
and jeopardize the whole goddamn thing,

34:36.205 --> 34:37.521
it displeases me.

34:40.376 --> 34:41.914
Do you have a cigarette?

34:43.012 --> 34:44.911
- I don't smoke.
- Bull.

34:44.980 --> 34:46.907
I have a good nose.

34:50.485 --> 34:51.753
It did pay off, though.

34:55.858 --> 34:59.642
Last night, it shows how
Cardinal launders his rat money.

34:59.861 --> 35:01.561
He buys black market chips,

35:01.596 --> 35:02.562
cashes them in.

35:02.597 --> 35:03.563
It's good!

35:03.598 --> 35:05.432
Without a connection to Corbett,

35:05.466 --> 35:06.500
it's nothing.

35:06.534 --> 35:07.942
- No...
- It's zero.

35:12.161 --> 35:13.874
Why didn't you tell
me his wife was sick?

35:15.109 --> 35:16.410
What difference does it make?

35:16.444 --> 35:18.445
I don't know. I'm trying
to get in the guy's head.

35:20.532 --> 35:21.581
His bank deposits,

35:21.616 --> 35:22.693
it could help. Did you look?

35:22.717 --> 35:23.717
No, not an option.

35:24.735 --> 35:25.662
The timing could help.

35:25.693 --> 35:26.964
Let's get a warrant, check his accounts.

35:26.988 --> 35:27.988
Delorme, no warrants!

35:30.792 --> 35:31.992
I'll manage the case.

35:32.860 --> 35:33.860
Stick to your job.

35:36.798 --> 35:38.131
I gotta go.

35:38.166 --> 35:39.299
Cardinal is waiting for me.

35:39.334 --> 35:40.300
Good, you can,

35:40.335 --> 35:41.668
I don't know, talk to him.

35:41.703 --> 35:44.004
Make him your pal, Delorme.

35:44.038 --> 35:45.005
Open him.

35:45.039 --> 35:46.440
- Do you understand?
- Hey. Yes.

35:46.474 --> 35:48.211
Do you understand how big this is?

35:49.243 --> 35:50.243
I do.

35:59.581 --> 36:00.654
Look,

36:03.314 --> 36:04.424
if this goes well,

36:06.088 --> 36:07.289
it's gonna be good for you.

36:12.628 --> 36:13.628
I'll see to it.

36:17.748 --> 36:19.234
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:19.268 --> 36:20.669
I don't know what your secret is.

36:21.470 --> 36:22.437
What do you mean?

36:22.471 --> 36:24.272
Cardinal. You've
turned him right around.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.896
He called you a
promising young detective.

36:29.946 --> 36:30.946
He did?

36:32.148 --> 36:34.516
No, but he said you're not
a complete waste of a badge.

36:36.152 --> 36:37.596
It's a shame you're
only here temporarily.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.820
We could use more like you.

36:48.998 --> 36:50.500
Struck by inspiration?

36:51.968 --> 36:52.968
I was thinking about it.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.503
You should come over
to our place one night.

36:55.538 --> 36:56.972
Josh is a pretty good cook.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.006
This is your car.

36:59.308 --> 37:00.308
Yeah.

37:01.477 --> 37:02.595
Why?

37:02.643 --> 37:05.438
You're gonna want to remove
all the identifying features.

37:06.954 --> 37:08.616
You make enemies in this job.

37:08.651 --> 37:09.861
You don't want anything on your car

37:09.885 --> 37:11.086
might catch somebody's eye.

37:12.588 --> 37:13.588
Do you mean that?

37:15.558 --> 37:17.192
My whole league has those.

37:17.226 --> 37:18.626
You see them everywhere.

37:18.661 --> 37:20.685
Why'd you leave Financial Crimes?

37:23.499 --> 37:24.699
You never did tell me.

37:25.668 --> 37:26.668
Just grew out of it.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.640
You won't see much of
your team this season.

37:32.675 --> 37:34.509
You're gonna have to
clear your calendar.

37:37.747 --> 37:38.747
Understood.

37:40.282 --> 37:41.282
'Cause he won't stop,

37:42.118 --> 37:43.151
Delorme.

37:43.185 --> 37:44.185
Not until we stop him.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.058
Nothing else matters.

38:50.510 --> 38:51.519
Thanks.

39:22.014 --> 39:23.314
Is that your guitar?

39:23.573 --> 39:24.983
Yeah.

39:25.017 --> 39:26.217
- You play it?
- Yeah.

39:28.253 --> 39:30.463
Of course you do.
Sorry. Stupid question.

39:32.925 --> 39:34.547
He's not interested, mutt.

39:35.070 --> 39:36.367
Hey dude, come on.

39:37.596 --> 39:38.858
You are interested?

39:39.631 --> 39:40.631
My mistake.

39:43.202 --> 39:44.402
What is that on your face?

39:49.708 --> 39:50.875
Is that some kind of burn?

39:50.909 --> 39:52.759
Hey man, mind your own business.

39:53.946 --> 39:54.946
All right.

39:56.248 --> 39:57.559
You're awfully concerned about her man,

39:57.583 --> 39:59.584
maybe you should be more
worried about yourself.

40:01.693 --> 40:02.904
Could be contagious.

40:03.482 --> 40:04.842
Look, nobody was talking to you.

40:11.296 --> 40:14.298
All right. Okay. Come on.

40:16.135 --> 40:17.568
Have a good night, kids.

40:31.183 --> 40:32.183
Thank you.

40:33.852 --> 40:36.054
I seem to bring it out in people.

40:36.088 --> 40:38.122
No, don't blame yourself,

40:38.157 --> 40:39.357
that guy was a head case.

40:40.926 --> 40:41.926
Have a good night.

40:56.275 --> 40:57.475
Can I ask you a favour?

40:58.710 --> 41:00.344
I don't want to be here anymore.

41:01.180 --> 41:02.180
Could you walk me home?

41:05.350 --> 41:06.990
I don't feel safe with
that guy out there.

41:08.620 --> 41:09.620
I-I just...

41:10.155 --> 41:11.938
My place isn't far.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.640
I just ordered this drink. I'm sorry.

41:17.463 --> 41:19.063
I could call you a cab if you want.

41:21.467 --> 41:22.983
Don't bother.

41:50.229 --> 41:51.229
Where's your friend?

41:55.334 --> 41:56.868
You thought he was gonna walk you home

41:56.902 --> 41:57.902
like a gentleman.

41:59.438 --> 42:01.462
Is that impossible to imagine?

42:04.009 --> 42:05.579
You're asking the wrong questions.

42:06.745 --> 42:08.212
It doesn't matter how nice he is.

42:08.247 --> 42:09.313
It matters to me.

42:09.348 --> 42:10.348
It shouldn't.

42:12.017 --> 42:13.017
It can't.

42:17.356 --> 42:18.556
Did you give it to him?

42:21.426 --> 42:23.594
While you were insulting me.

42:24.730 --> 42:25.930
We can still drive away,

42:27.199 --> 42:28.199
leave him behind.

42:30.802 --> 42:31.802
Is that what you want?

42:39.711 --> 42:40.711
We're doing this.
