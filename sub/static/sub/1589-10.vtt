00:02.170 --> 00:02.693
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on Pretty Little Liars

00:03.770 --> 00:04.691
I asked Noel to break
into Hanna's house tonight.

00:05.670 --> 00:07.137
That's who was in the kitchen.
It was Noel.

00:07.270 --> 00:08.362
Hey, how's your mom?
Freaked.

00:08.470 --> 00:09.630
Guys, we needed
to do that.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.298
You saw Tanner
cornering me at school.

00:11.410 --> 00:12.638
She's trying
to poke holes in our story.

00:12.740 --> 00:13.638
Your story.

00:13.740 --> 00:15.276
Can you take this?

00:15.410 --> 00:16.775
Give each of the girls a copy.
They need to memorize it.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.279
You recorded that?

00:18.380 --> 00:20.416
Would you let me borrow
one of those cameras?

00:20.550 --> 00:22.711
SPENCER: The camera
is for my sister.

00:22.820 --> 00:24.412
She's connected
to all of this.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.408
Aria, if you don't want me
to get married...

00:26.520 --> 00:28.078
It has to do
with you marrying Zack.

00:28.190 --> 00:29.555
Was he inappropriate
with you?

00:29.690 --> 00:30.759
Maybe he was with Hanna.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.350
Ali, where did
that scar come from,

00:32.460 --> 00:33.392
the one on your thigh?

00:33.500 --> 00:34.353
Caleb, this can't go on.

00:34.700 --> 00:35.849
SPENCER:
I'm talking about Hanna.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.190
She's getting wasted
in the middle of the day.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.029
EMILY: I'm in Noel's car

00:40.140 --> 00:41.437
and he has pictures
of Alison.

00:41.570 --> 00:43.208
He put them
in the same envelope

00:43.310 --> 00:44.368
as the tape
he was listening to.

00:44.470 --> 00:45.698
They caught him, the person

00:45.810 --> 00:47.175
who broke in here last night.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.077
Alison, is that the man
who kidnapped you?

01:00.620 --> 01:01.712
What's his name?

01:01.860 --> 01:03.452
Cyrus Petrillo.

01:05.130 --> 01:06.654
How did you find him?

01:06.760 --> 01:09.263
Mrs. Marin's neighbor
reported a man lurking

01:09.370 --> 01:10.519
in her yard.

01:11.700 --> 01:12.769
And he's admitted
to everything?

01:12.870 --> 01:15.191
His story
matches Alison's.

01:15.340 --> 01:18.059
The abduction,
the blindfold, her escape.

01:19.310 --> 01:20.470
I'm telling you
the same thing

01:20.580 --> 01:22.468
I told Ashley Marin
and your daughter.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.377
Not a word of this
to anyone

01:24.480 --> 01:27.278
until we get enough evidence
to press charges.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.619
is who he says he is.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.148
Lieutenant...

01:34.490 --> 01:35.718
where is she?

01:41.900 --> 01:43.219
( door opening )

01:46.700 --> 01:47.735
It must be him.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.832
Is that him?

01:51.940 --> 01:53.635
Is that the man
who hurt you?

02:00.950 --> 02:02.315
I don't know.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.212
You said
you don't know?

02:05.320 --> 02:06.651
What was I supposed
to say, Spencer?

02:06.790 --> 02:08.212
How about "no"?

02:08.320 --> 02:09.856
I was blindfolded,
remember?

02:09.960 --> 02:12.224
I'm sorry, do we seriously
have to remind you

02:12.330 --> 02:13.524
that you were never
actually kidnapped?

02:13.630 --> 02:15.393
There's a man being
questioned by the police

02:15.500 --> 02:17.764
right now for a crime
that never happened.

02:17.870 --> 02:19.758
Guys, this is "A".

02:19.870 --> 02:21.690
I mean, you said he knew
about the rock that hit you.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.631
He knew where you were kept,
what you ate,

02:23.740 --> 02:25.207
what mattress you slept on.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.778
It's the same story
that you told the doctor.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.541
And Holbrook, the night
we got back from New York.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.148
Well, it doesn't matter
where "A" got it.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.218
What matters is what "A"
IS planning to do now.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.844
If "A" is behind this,
that's exactly

02:35.950 --> 02:37.611
who that guy is gonna run
to when he panics.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.312
What are you saying?

02:39.420 --> 02:41.411
I'm saying,
ifI can make him think

02:41.560 --> 02:42.925
that he's gonna
go down for this,

02:43.030 --> 02:45.351
we can follow him to "A"
and finally win "A's" game.

02:45.460 --> 02:46.597
Great.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.554
We win the game,
we find out who "A" is.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.395
What happens
when we lose?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.899
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

02:56.000 --> 02:58.662
* Swear this one
you'll save *

02:58.770 --> 03:00.931
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:01.040 --> 03:03.600
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:03.710 --> 03:05.746
* If I show you
then I know *

03:05.850 --> 03:08.842
* You won't tell
what I saId *

03:08.950 --> 03:11.180
* 'Cause two can keep
a secret *

03:11.320 --> 03:13.709
* If one of them is dead

03:15.920 --> 03:17.182
HANNA: Is it weird
that we haven't gotten

03:17.330 --> 03:18.524
an "A" message about this yet?

03:18.860 --> 03:21.727
No, I don't need a creepy text
to read the writing on the wall.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.760
The second All says
that this guy kidnapped her,

03:23.870 --> 03:25.360
we're gonna figure out
that Cyrus Petrillo's

03:25.470 --> 03:27.461
a sheep farmer in Montana
and couldn't possibly

03:27.570 --> 03:28.639
have done this.

03:28.740 --> 03:29.707
And then
the whole world's gonna know

03:29.810 --> 03:31.402
that Ali's a big fat liar.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.899
And us. Right now, we're just
as big and fat as she is.

03:34.010 --> 03:35.272
Hey, QUYS,
keep your voices down.

03:35.380 --> 03:36.574
Yeah.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.204
Thank God the cops are here
so we don't have

03:38.310 --> 03:39.846
to worry about being
imaginary kidnapped.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.440
Yeah,
but once Tanner figures out

03:41.550 --> 03:43.211
that the kidnapping story
is a lie,

03:43.320 --> 03:45.379
they're gonna figure out about
New York and Shana real quick.

03:45.490 --> 03:46.787
Ali's not an idiot.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.710
She's not gonna walk
right into an obvious "A" trap.

03:48.820 --> 03:50.458
We don't know
that anymore.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.551
We all heard her in there.
She's gone rogue.

03:52.660 --> 03:54.821
Okay, well, someone needs
to go back in there

03:54.930 --> 03:57.490
and make sure
that she doesn't ID this guy.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.521
Right, well, Emily?

03:58.630 --> 03:59.938
Yeah.
Yeah.

04:01.340 --> 04:02.705
Spencer's the convincing one.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.607
Yeah, but you're the hardest
to disappoint.

04:04.710 --> 04:05.802
It's about your eyes.

04:07.710 --> 04:08.734
Awesome.

04:10.550 --> 04:11.608
( sighs )

04:11.710 --> 04:12.916
How's your mom doing?

04:13.020 --> 04:15.272
She's heartbroken.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.779
God, it's so awful.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.346
I mean, first your dad
cheats on her

04:18.450 --> 04:19.849
and then this sleazebag
boyfriend hits on me.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.382
Hanna, she was there.

04:21.490 --> 04:22.889
She doesn't need
a play-by-play.

04:24.460 --> 04:25.484
I'm just sorry.
That's all.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.524
Thanks.

04:27.660 --> 04:28.558
You need a ride?

04:28.660 --> 04:30.525
Yeah.

04:30.630 --> 04:31.665
What is that?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.392
_It's Noel Kahn's
Insurance policy.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.263
It's everything
that Shana gave to Jenna

04:36.410 --> 04:38.435
that proves that All
wasn't dead.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.609
A|i knew
it was out there,

04:39.710 --> 04:40.734
she just didn't tell us
about it.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.672
Tanner would sure love
to get her hands on this.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.270
Yeah.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.446
A|i talking to Shana
when she's supposed to be dead.

04:47.550 --> 04:48.812
You mean kidnapped.

04:50.420 --> 04:51.648
A|i doesn't know you
have this, right?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.854
No, but I'm headed to my house
right now to stash it.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.915
In your house?

04:55.020 --> 04:55.952
Is it safe?

04:56.090 --> 04:56.954
I have a spot.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.057
A spot?

04:58.160 --> 04:59.650
That nobody else
knows about.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.923
Well, maybe you should
tell us where this is.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.828
You know, just in case
anything were to happen to you.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.564
Good-bye, Hanna.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.637
Be careful please.
I will.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.536
Aria's right.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.801
If you identify this guy,
it will be way too easy

05:17.910 --> 05:19.548
for "A" to prove
that you're lying.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.618
We don't even know_
who this Cyrus person IS

05:21.720 --> 05:23.085
or where he came from.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.782
I get it, Em.

05:24.890 --> 05:25.845
Okay? I do.

05:27.590 --> 05:29.080
But I can't just say
that this guy is innocent.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.418
Why not?

05:30.530 --> 05:31.883
Ali, it's--

05:33.460 --> 05:35.758
Oh. Emily, hi.

05:35.860 --> 05:38.988
Uh, I just got back
from the station and, Emily,

05:39.130 --> 05:40.893
could I have
a word with Ali?

05:41.900 --> 05:43.003
Dad, I already told her.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.635
Al, you were
not supposed to do that.

05:45.740 --> 05:47.002
Emily helped save my life.

05:47.140 --> 05:48.698
She deserves to know
what's going on.

05:48.810 --> 05:51.745
The person you should be
talking to is Tanner.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.347
That man knew
every detail.

05:56.450 --> 05:58.486
How would he know
that unless he did it?

06:06.430 --> 06:07.624
He confessed already.

06:09.130 --> 06:11.018
The police said this
same man could have

06:11.130 --> 06:13.667
killed your mom
and Bethany Young.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.637
We're all here
to support you, Al.

06:17.770 --> 06:19.909
Emily,
all of your friends,

06:20.010 --> 06:21.637
we all want
the same thing...

06:23.050 --> 06:25.143
to put this man away
for a very long time.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.048
Yeah.

06:33.190 --> 06:34.111
We...

06:34.220 --> 06:35.653
all want you safe.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.920
Whatever you're afraid of,
please, don't be.

06:42.930 --> 06:45.125
This man is behind bars

06:45.230 --> 06:47.767
and all we have to do
is keep him there.

06:52.610 --> 06:54.407
Yes, I know I just made
the appointment,

06:54.540 --> 06:56.076
but the situation has changed.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.946
No, I don't need
to reschedule,

07:00.050 --> 07:02.018
because I don't need
to book a banquet hall

07:02.120 --> 07:03.417
for a party of one.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.589
ARIA: Mom?

07:05.820 --> 07:06.957
( sighs )

07:07.090 --> 07:09.081
Mom, you don't have
to do that right now.

07:09.190 --> 07:10.919
I just want
to get it over with.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.058
Well, Mike says that you haven't
eaten all day.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.422
Um...

07:18.700 --> 07:19.894
It's pesto and mozzarella.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.558
It's your favorite.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.899
It was incredibly sweet of you
to make this for me, honey,

07:27.010 --> 07:29.774
but I just don't think
I'm up to eating.

07:31.850 --> 07:32.976
I'm sorry.

07:34.750 --> 07:35.910
It's okay.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.125
I should have
seen this coming.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.024
I was too old for him,
I was too trusting.

07:47.130 --> 07:48.449
Mom...

07:48.560 --> 07:52.690
Mom, this has nothing
to do with your age.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.464
This isn't your fault.

07:56.870 --> 07:59.134
There were signs, Aria,

07:59.240 --> 08:01.470
and I just drove
right past them.

08:01.610 --> 08:03.874
Because I wanted
to believe that it could work,

08:03.980 --> 08:06.073
I wanted to believe
that he could change.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.511
Hey.

08:09.020 --> 08:12.581
You're the one that taught me
that second chances exist.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.612
Your bliss
is still ahead of you.

08:16.260 --> 08:20.048
Honey, when I said that,
I was talking about Zack.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.491
So...

08:26.270 --> 08:27.191
Okay.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.131
Well...

08:29.240 --> 08:31.708
why don't you let me make
the rest of these calls, okay?

08:32.910 --> 08:34.605
The last thing you need
to do is recount

08:34.710 --> 08:36.268
your break-up
to a bunch of strangers.

08:42.650 --> 08:44.686
How the hell did "A"
get somebody to confess?

08:45.820 --> 08:47.515
I don't know.

08:47.620 --> 08:48.757
What's All gonna do?

08:48.860 --> 08:50.748
Whatever
the hell she wants.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.055
Don't you think you should
find out what that is?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.656
Nope.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.051
Uh, I was eating that.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.059
Hanna.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.535
Hanna,
what are you doing?

09:02.640 --> 09:04.232
None of this stuff
is good for you.

09:04.340 --> 09:06.308
Soda, beer,
soggy nachos?

09:06.410 --> 09:08.071
It's poison, Caleb.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.678
When was the last time
we ate a vegetable

09:10.780 --> 09:11.974
that wasn't battered
and fried?

09:12.080 --> 09:13.741
You know what?
Enough trash talking my diet.

09:13.850 --> 09:15.147
What is going on?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.081
Nothing.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.988
Just another day in the life
of Alison DiLaurentis.

09:20.090 --> 09:21.648
She's in the driver's seat
of my life

09:21.760 --> 09:24.081
and I'm supposed to watch her
just steer me off a cliff?

09:24.190 --> 09:25.623
I'm sick of it.

09:25.730 --> 09:28.858
Okay, well then, toss her,
not my fried zucchini.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.564
You know, the other day
Ms. Adinolfi

09:30.670 --> 09:33.230
made an announcement about
chorus auditions for a solo

09:33.370 --> 09:35.691
and all the girls
are freaking out.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.337
Then I thought, wow,
what's that like?

09:38.440 --> 09:41.773
To lose sleep over some stupid
chorus audition.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.108
I mean, is that
what normal people do?

09:43.210 --> 09:45.098
They go to football games
and wave pompoms

09:45.210 --> 09:47.576
and freak out over
a chorus solo?

09:47.680 --> 09:50.979
Normal people are not being
hounded by "A'.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.239
Besides, you don't care
about that stuff.

09:52.350 --> 09:55.012
Well, maybe I should.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.990
Look, I don't know
what I'm gonna do about Alison,

10:01.130 --> 10:03.121
but I am going
to that stupid audition.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.994
Hey, how'd it go with Ali?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.034
EMILY: Unclear.

10:11.140 --> 10:12.732
Mr. D.
kind of kicked me out.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.939
Did you find
a place for the...

10:15.040 --> 10:17.144
thing you got from
you-know-who?

10:17.280 --> 10:18.599
You speaking
in code now?

10:18.710 --> 10:20.177
Seems like a good idea.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.941
Roger Wilco.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.740
We still need _
a more permanent solution,

10:24.850 --> 10:25.885
but I've got
a temporary one.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.389
What are you up to?

10:27.490 --> 10:29.685
Avoiding the Brew
as much as possible.

10:29.790 --> 10:32.088
Zack went back to Austria,
but the place is still tainted.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.226
Have you ever tried
Blue Light Cafe?

10:34.330 --> 10:35.228
SPENCER: NO.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.297
Good.
Well, don't.

10:36.430 --> 10:37.966
Okay.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.267
( gasps )

10:42.370 --> 10:43.860
What's going on, Spencer?

10:43.970 --> 10:44.868
It's gone.

10:44.970 --> 10:46.938
What's gone?

10:47.040 --> 10:49.270
The recording Ali gave me
and the medical exam, it's gone.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.072
Gone as in "stolen"
or gone as In--

10:52.180 --> 10:54.671
No, this isn't code, Emily.
It's gone as in "it's not here."

10:54.780 --> 10:56.145
Just give me
a second, okay?

10:56.250 --> 10:57.342
Spencer?

10:58.350 --> 10:59.647
Spencer?

11:02.760 --> 11:03.784
Need any help?

11:05.360 --> 11:06.918
I thought you left already.

11:07.030 --> 11:08.054
We forgot the grocery list.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.294
Looking for something
or just redecorating?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.334
Ijust...

11:13.440 --> 11:14.793
I dropped my pen.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.197
What do you want,
Melissa?

11:16.340 --> 11:17.932
Mom wanted me to check,
see if you'd like

11:18.040 --> 11:19.803
anything special
for dinner tonight.

11:21.210 --> 11:22.746
( cell phone ringing )

11:25.180 --> 11:25.999
Take it.
I'll wait.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.340
Emily, I'll have
to call you back later.

11:32.090 --> 11:34.081
ALISON: ( recorded )
He followed me into my yard

11:34.190 --> 11:35.851
and then he hit me
with that rock.

11:35.960 --> 11:39.123
Next thing I knew
I woke up blindfolded.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.021
I can't sleep.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.927
Even now.

11:44.030 --> 11:46.066
I can still hear him
breathing.

11:49.370 --> 11:50.906
Something wrong?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.307
Just tell mom we're out
of peanut butter, okay?

12:13.460 --> 12:14.825
( panting )

12:14.930 --> 12:16.192
I'm really glad
that we're doing this.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.860
Me, too.
You good?

12:19.000 --> 12:19.864
Yeah. Great.

12:20.000 --> 12:20.967
( music blaring from car)

12:21.070 --> 12:22.958
Are we almost done?

12:23.070 --> 12:24.298
Is that Spencer?

12:26.070 --> 12:27.435
Maybe we should
just go back the other way.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.178
It's a loop, Hanna.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.099
SPENCER: Hanna?

12:33.150 --> 12:34.117
When your mom said
you were out on a run,

12:34.220 --> 12:35.244
I thought she was joking.

12:35.350 --> 12:37.887
Well,
seeing is believing, Spencer.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.116
Caleb, can you just
give us a second?

12:39.220 --> 12:40.118
No.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.118
No?

12:41.220 --> 12:42.209
No, we're doing a loop.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.287
Hanna, this is important!

12:43.430 --> 12:44.283
( sighs )

12:44.430 --> 12:45.852
Fine.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.291
Look, I just stayed up
all night looking through

12:47.400 --> 12:48.924
the surveillance footage
of my baclqard,

12:49.030 --> 12:50.361
trying to figure out who took
the recording of Ali--

12:50.470 --> 12:52.290
Okay, whatever it is,
I'm just not interested.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.890
You don't even know
what it is yet.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.093
Look, I have to be
at that audition in an hour.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.031
I have to go.
What audition?

12:58.140 --> 13:00.438
Hanna, are you seriously
running away from me?

13:00.580 --> 13:02.400
I'm faster than you, Hanna!
I have a car.

13:02.510 --> 13:04.171
Hey, just lay off,
Spence.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.440
What is going on?

13:05.550 --> 13:08.246
You asked me
to help Hanna.

13:08.350 --> 13:09.442
That's what I'm doing.

13:14.390 --> 13:15.914
SPENCER:
Just watch the bushes.

13:18.090 --> 13:18.988
Who is that?

13:19.090 --> 13:20.159
Just watch.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.221
ARIA: She just gave him
something, right?

13:26.330 --> 13:27.797
Yeah.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.339
That's not all.

13:29.470 --> 13:30.835
Watch what she's saying.

13:31.970 --> 13:33.278
Do it.
Trust me.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.301
Do it.

13:34.410 --> 13:35.377
When was this?

13:35.480 --> 13:36.947
It was three nights ago.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.446
Less than 24 hours
before Cyrus Petrillo confessed.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.177
What, you think the guy
in the video

13:41.280 --> 13:42.986
in your backyard is Ali's
fake kidnapper?

13:43.090 --> 13:46.014
That Melissa stole the recording
and gave it to him?

13:46.120 --> 13:47.417
I mean, we already know
she's working for Mona,

13:47.520 --> 13:48.919
so why not "A," too?

13:49.020 --> 13:50.226
'Cause it's gonna
make my head explode.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.354
That's why.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.355
Oh, my God, do you think
that Melissa sent that text?

13:55.500 --> 13:56.489
Maybe.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.999
I mean, she always
liked chess.

13:59.230 --> 14:01.892
Look, Aria, we cannot
take anymore chances.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.137
We have to cut the cord
with Ali

14:03.240 --> 14:04.332
before she drags us
down with her.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.228
I'm saying we use
what we got from Noel.

14:07.340 --> 14:09.433
The pictures,
the conversations with Shana,

14:09.540 --> 14:11.246
'cause they prove
that All was alive

14:11.350 --> 14:13.875
and decidedly un-kidnapped
for the past 2 years.

14:13.980 --> 14:15.914
Okay.
And that helps us how?

14:16.020 --> 14:18.887
We go to Tanner
and we tell her the truth,

14:18.990 --> 14:20.309
that we thought
that All was dead

14:20.420 --> 14:21.887
up until Ravenswood.

14:21.990 --> 14:23.423
The only thing that we know
about the past 2 years

14:23.530 --> 14:25.350
is whatever All told us,
that she lied to us,

14:25.460 --> 14:26.620
just like
she lied to them.

14:26.730 --> 14:28.288
Okay.
But what about New York?

14:28.400 --> 14:29.594
We can't just
come half clean.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.065
I know.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.467
But we tell her
what happened there, too,

14:32.570 --> 14:33.468
that it was self-defense
and you were protecting us.

14:33.570 --> 14:34.889
That's the truth.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.194
But the truth
doesn't amount to much

14:36.300 --> 14:38.131
when it comes
from a bunch of IIars.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.137
Spencer, the whole reason
I'm freaking out

14:41.280 --> 14:42.429
about this Cyrus thing

14:42.540 --> 14:44.303
is that it could lead Tanner
to the theater.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.071
And now you want to beat
"A" to the punch?

14:46.180 --> 14:47.408
Exactly.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.239
Because it's better
if they find out from us.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.096
( singing )

15:14.980 --> 15:17.642
So what are you saying,

15:17.750 --> 15:19.342
that Alison might say
this guy's guilty?

15:19.450 --> 15:20.678
Yeah.

15:20.780 --> 15:22.179
She thinks that he's gonna
lead her to "A,"

15:22.280 --> 15:23.542
when really "A's"
gonna make this

15:23.650 --> 15:25.447
whole confession lead
Tanner back to us.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.051
But she wouldn't
do that.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.048
She's crazy,
but she's not stupid.

15:29.190 --> 15:30.350
Yeah, I thought so, too.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.927
But a whole day has passed
and this guy,

15:32.030 --> 15:33.395
_ he's still _
Sitting in jail.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.465
Everything's gone, right?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.921
The book, the research,
the photos of Ali, all of it?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.189
Because if Tanner
comes here--

15:41.300 --> 15:42.528
Aria, you were the one
that sent Spencer

15:42.640 --> 15:44.062
over to help me
move everything.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.205
Remember?

15:46.470 --> 15:47.607
She's very thorough.
You and I both know that.

15:47.740 --> 15:48.934
Where is she?

15:50.280 --> 15:51.599
Who? Spencer?
No. Alison.

15:51.710 --> 15:53.041
Why?

15:53.150 --> 15:54.071
Because I want to talk to her,
that's why.

15:54.180 --> 15:55.670
No.
No, you're not.

15:55.780 --> 15:58.681
You just got
your stitches out, Ezra.

15:58.790 --> 16:00.155
You're about to take
a bike ride

16:00.260 --> 16:01.488
for the first time
in God knows how long.

16:01.620 --> 16:03.429
You just got the all-clear
from your doctor.

16:03.530 --> 16:08.092
You're okay again.
You're really okay, and--

16:08.200 --> 16:10.566
No, I-- I'm not gonna
allow you to jump back on

16:10.670 --> 16:12.160
Ali's crazy train.

16:12.270 --> 16:14.431
Not with Tanner circling
and "A" watching our every move.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.689
N_o.
Aria--

16:15.800 --> 16:18.405
No. Promise me
you won't speak to her.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.370
Please.

16:23.180 --> 16:24.738
I like knowing
that you're safe.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.372
Okay.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.016
Okay, I promise.

16:37.260 --> 16:39.080
How long
till your dad gets back?

16:39.190 --> 16:40.657
About an hour.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.398
He's meeting
with a social worker.

16:42.530 --> 16:44.395
Why?

16:44.530 --> 16:46.020
He thinks
I'm afraid of retribution.

16:48.670 --> 16:49.739
He thinks
that's the reason

16:49.840 --> 16:51.432
why you don't want
to ID this guy?

16:55.810 --> 16:59.109
Look, I know your dad
is putting pressure on you.

16:59.210 --> 17:00.074
Okay? I--

17:00.180 --> 17:01.147
I know he's convinced

17:01.280 --> 17:02.474
that this is the guy
who took you

17:02.580 --> 17:05.743
and killed your mom
and Bethany Young.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.556
And I'm sure Tanner
would love to wrap up

17:07.660 --> 17:09.480
all three nightmares
with a neat little bow

17:09.590 --> 17:10.750
and you...

17:10.860 --> 17:12.418
What about me?

17:12.560 --> 17:15.791
You love that, for once,
everyone seems to believe you.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.094
That's not
what this is about.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.428
Good.

17:18.530 --> 17:20.168
'Cause, I swear,
if you let some stranger

17:20.300 --> 17:22.097
go to jail because you're trying
to cover your ass--

17:22.200 --> 17:24.031
He's not a stranger, Emily.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.663
Who? Cyrus?

17:26.770 --> 17:28.032
What do you mean
"he's not a stranger"?

17:28.140 --> 17:29.676
Do you know him?

17:29.780 --> 17:31.441
I don't know how "A"
found him...

17:33.450 --> 17:34.474
but...

17:36.480 --> 17:38.289
he's the one _
who gave me this.

17:48.330 --> 17:50.059
You were living
with this person?

17:51.700 --> 17:53.531
In an abandoned
basement?

17:56.540 --> 17:57.700
Did he know
who you were?

17:59.770 --> 18:01.203
Just that I was on the run.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.773
He said he could tell
that I was different.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.619
Special.

18:10.220 --> 18:11.744
What happened, Ali?

18:13.490 --> 18:14.514
He didn't want me.

18:17.690 --> 18:19.180
He just wanted my stuff...

18:20.360 --> 18:21.349
my money.

18:25.470 --> 18:26.767
And the way
he looked at me...

18:30.240 --> 18:31.707
like I was
nothing to him.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.102
Worse than nothing.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.143
I'm sorry, Ali.

18:41.250 --> 18:45.346
But "A" is using
this creep to trap you,

18:45.450 --> 18:47.281
to trap all of us.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.685
"A" wants you
to identify him.

18:52.430 --> 18:53.852
You have to let him go.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.292
You know that, right?

19:02.470 --> 19:03.630
I know.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.602
* But you're neither
friend nor foe *

19:09.710 --> 19:13.146
* Though I can't
seem to let you go *

19:13.250 --> 19:15.411
* The one thing
that I still know *

19:15.550 --> 19:19.839
* Is that
you're keeping me down *

19:21.560 --> 19:23.187
Okay!
Mona, we get it.

19:23.290 --> 19:24.257
You can freaking sing.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.554
( door opens )

19:27.400 --> 19:28.424
Okay.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.199
Next up,
we have Jamie DeMayo,

19:31.300 --> 19:33.768
Hanna Marin, Ronni High

19:33.870 --> 19:35.428
and Mona Vanderwaal.

19:35.540 --> 19:36.564
Come on in, girls.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.859
( thudding and crashing )

19:41.310 --> 19:42.834
Mona!

19:45.510 --> 19:46.909
Mona!

19:48.780 --> 19:50.839
You were supposed
to meet me outside

19:50.950 --> 19:52.508
my house, not in my room.

19:52.620 --> 19:54.451
Your mom let me in
on her way out.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.448
She made me some snacks.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.584
Carrot stick?

19:57.730 --> 19:59.288
I don't want this
in my house.

19:59.390 --> 20:01.290
If it's not safe at your place,
it's not safe at mine.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.561
( cell phone ringing )

20:03.670 --> 20:04.694
Is that "A" again?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.495
No, it's Noel Kahn.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.498
He wants his loot back.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.897
Okay, don't answer.

20:09.000 --> 20:09.967
No, I have to.

20:10.070 --> 20:11.207
We might need him.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.299
What if he has more pictures

20:12.410 --> 20:13.604
or information
that we can use?

20:13.710 --> 20:14.734
Use for what?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.529
To turn on our friend?

20:17.780 --> 20:20.203
Aria filled me in
on your great idea.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.969
It's not gonna happen,
Spencen

20:22.080 --> 20:24.241
What we should be doing
is burning this stuff.

20:24.350 --> 20:25.510
Emily...

20:25.620 --> 20:27.417
Ali is _not our friend
right now.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.408
She's a dangerous person
who has no problem

20:29.520 --> 20:30.726
gambling with our lives.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.718
She's not dangerous,
she's hurt.

20:32.830 --> 20:35.458
I'm sorry, what?

20:39.700 --> 20:40.860
She doesn't want me
to tell you.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.400
Oh, no, of course,
she doesn't.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.239
It's always the same
with you two, isn't it?

20:46.340 --> 20:47.773
Just trust me, okay?

20:47.880 --> 20:49.302
She's not gonna
ID this guy.

20:49.410 --> 20:50.377
( scoffs )

20:50.510 --> 20:51.670
She's gonna wait out
the 48 hours

20:51.780 --> 20:53.338
and after that the cops have
to let him go,

20:53.450 --> 20:54.348
and it's all over.

20:54.450 --> 20:55.348
And you believe her?

20:55.450 --> 20:56.917
After all the lies she's told?

20:57.050 --> 20:58.449
I do.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.484
We're either all in this
together or we're not.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.787
Ali's not the problem,
Spencen

21:05.890 --> 21:07.323
Melissa is.

21:07.430 --> 21:08.658
She's the one
that gave Cyrus

21:08.800 --> 21:10.688
the recording
of Ali's medical exam.

21:12.530 --> 21:15.590
I did my part,
I talked to Ali.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.100
If you really want to help,
talk to your sister.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.299
Mona?

21:24.080 --> 21:25.308
Mona, can you hear me?

21:29.420 --> 21:30.614
What happened?

21:30.720 --> 21:31.641
Where am I?

21:31.750 --> 21:33.809
No, no.
Lay down.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.387
Mona, you fainted.

21:35.490 --> 21:36.787
You were out
for almost a minute.

21:36.890 --> 21:38.824
Where's my bag?

21:39.960 --> 21:41.052
It's over there.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.899
Ms. Adinolfi is on the phone
with your mom.

21:44.900 --> 21:45.889
Give it to me.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.331
I need my bag.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.338
MISS ADINOLFI:
Your mom's on her way.

21:54.710 --> 21:55.608
What can I get for you?

21:55.710 --> 21:56.870
Juice?

21:56.980 --> 21:58.072
Maybe some water?

22:00.720 --> 22:01.812
How's your head?

22:05.720 --> 22:06.846
Anything hurt or--

22:06.990 --> 22:08.059
MONA: Hanna, my bag.

22:33.650 --> 22:35.379
You are not in this alone.

22:36.650 --> 22:38.015
A lot of people
have supported you,

22:38.150 --> 22:39.549
done whatever you've asked,

22:39.650 --> 22:41.789
gone along
with all your stories.

22:41.890 --> 22:42.788
Is this a threat?

22:42.890 --> 22:43.879
No.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.657
Right now
it's an observation.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.355
Did Aria ask you
to talk to me?

22:49.760 --> 22:51.022
Because if one more
person tells me

22:51.170 --> 22:52.922
what I should do, I swear
I'm gonna scream.

22:53.030 --> 22:54.361
Oh.
KENNETH: Can I help you?

22:56.600 --> 22:57.908
If there's something you
need to tell my daughter,

22:58.010 --> 23:00.638
you can talk to me
or with the police.

23:00.780 --> 23:01.769
Oh, no.

23:01.910 --> 23:02.877
I'm so sorry.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.004
I was just saying hello.

23:08.050 --> 23:09.642
You okay?

23:09.750 --> 23:11.081
Was he bothering you?

23:11.190 --> 23:12.487
It's fine, Dad.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.728
We don't have much time.

23:21.830 --> 23:23.388
Alison, they have to
release him

23:23.530 --> 23:25.498
after 48 hours.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.090
Now, I know this is hard,

23:27.200 --> 23:28.929
but we really have to go.

23:29.040 --> 23:29.961
Um...

23:31.970 --> 23:34.609
You know, I think
I'm just gonna get a refill.

23:36.710 --> 23:37.745
Two minutes.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.155
( indistinct chatter on radio )

23:58.670 --> 23:59.989
Looks like
you recovered quickly.

24:06.610 --> 24:07.838
You followed me?

24:07.940 --> 24:09.532
Yep.

24:09.640 --> 24:10.709
Whose car is this?

24:11.710 --> 24:13.473
Is this a rental?

24:13.580 --> 24:14.478
You really go full out.

24:14.580 --> 24:15.478
Hanna--

24:15.580 --> 24:16.569
Mona, there was a mug shot

24:16.680 --> 24:18.181
of Cyrus Petrillo in your bag.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.712
So either you
set this whole thing up

24:19.850 --> 24:21.886
or you've been
bluescarfing the inside scoop.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.480
Snarfing, bluesnarfing.

24:23.590 --> 24:25.182
And no,
I didn't set this up.

24:25.290 --> 24:26.826
I'm here
to find out who did.

24:26.930 --> 24:28.488
Great. Me, too.

24:31.530 --> 24:33.122
What does this thing do?

24:33.270 --> 24:35.465
Hanna, get out.

24:36.740 --> 24:37.900
Look, Mona, we both
know that All brings out

24:38.010 --> 24:39.102
the "A" in you.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.734
So whether you're behind
this or not,

24:40.880 --> 24:42.734
I don't trust you one bit.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.671
And I'm not leaving here
until I find answers,

24:44.780 --> 24:46.543
either from you
or that doohickey.

24:47.280 --> 24:48.508
Fine.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.548
What are you doing?

24:50.650 --> 24:52.618
If you won't leave,
I will.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.218
Are you sure
you want to do that?

25:05.870 --> 25:07.098
Where are they going?

25:08.240 --> 25:09.138
What do we do now?

25:09.240 --> 25:10.832
We do nothing.

25:13.710 --> 25:15.200
Mona, we have to find out
where they're going.

25:15.310 --> 25:16.231
We have to follow them.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.238
Do something!

25:17.340 --> 25:18.671
No need to follow.

25:18.780 --> 25:20.202
I just got access
to Tanner's phone.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.147
TANNER: ( on radio )
170 to Control.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.218
Transporting witness
to 5th Street house

25:26.320 --> 25:28.117
for possible identification.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.983
18:54.

25:31.260 --> 25:32.887
Take off your seatbelt,
Hanna.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.151
We're not here
to follow her.

25:35.260 --> 25:36.852
We're here to follow him.

25:42.870 --> 25:43.962
What did you say to her?

25:44.070 --> 25:45.059
That her actions
have consequences.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.768
What about yours?

25:46.870 --> 25:48.076
Were you even listening
when I asked you

25:48.210 --> 25:49.131
not to talk to her?

25:49.240 --> 25:50.537
Yes, I was.

25:50.650 --> 25:51.947
And you
sought her out anyway?

25:52.050 --> 25:54.075
I...
I didn't...

25:54.180 --> 25:55.147
Here, let me just--

25:55.250 --> 25:56.148
No, I got it.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.547
Okay.

25:58.790 --> 25:59.882
I didn't seek her out.

25:59.990 --> 26:01.218
I saw her,
I made a split decision

26:01.320 --> 26:02.218
and I walked over.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.651
Right in the middle of town.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.079
Right in front of her dad.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.680
And what if Tanner saw you?

26:06.790 --> 26:08.223
Once she figures out
that you and Alison

26:08.360 --> 26:09.998
are connected, it is over.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.567
You get that, right?

26:12.800 --> 26:14.233
I'm sorry, Aria.
I really am.

26:14.370 --> 26:15.598
I was just trying to
help out

26:15.700 --> 26:16.598
and the only way
I knew how--

26:16.700 --> 26:18.236
By lying to me.

26:18.370 --> 26:19.928
By talking to Alison.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.109
Yeah,
the one thing I asked--
Because--

26:22.280 --> 26:24.100
The one thing
I asked you not to do.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.616
Why are you this upset?

26:55.780 --> 26:57.202
Find what
you were looking for?

26:58.780 --> 26:59.747
You were certainly in there

26:59.850 --> 27:01.010
for long enough.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.009
I was missing
my blue sweater.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.644
You know that one
with the buttons?

27:05.750 --> 27:07.615
I thought maybe
it ended up in the barn.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.789
Any luck?

27:09.890 --> 27:11.721
No, not really.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.622
I saw your computer.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.061
I know you're looking
at flights.

27:19.170 --> 27:20.091
London.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.339
Zurich. Taiwan.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.634
So are you
planning a vacation

27:23.740 --> 27:24.764
or are you running away?

27:24.910 --> 27:26.036
How is that
any of your busmess?

27:26.140 --> 27:27.334
I don't know, Melissa.
Is it?

27:28.780 --> 27:29.906
I know you're helping Mona,
okay?

27:30.040 --> 27:31.109
And now...

27:32.950 --> 27:34.019
is somebody making
you do something

27:34.120 --> 27:35.417
that you don't want to do?

27:35.520 --> 27:36.942
Are you trying
to run away?

27:38.050 --> 27:39.779
Is this
what it's come to?

27:39.890 --> 27:41.050
Searching
each other's rooms,

27:41.190 --> 27:42.259
looking for answers
to questions

27:42.360 --> 27:43.918
that we're too afraid to ask?

27:46.090 --> 27:48.251
I only helped Mona

27:48.360 --> 27:49.327
because I wanted
you to see that

27:49.460 --> 27:51.064
A|i hasn't changed.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.929
She's as toxic as ever.

27:58.140 --> 28:00.267
We both know
All wasn't kidnapped.

28:00.370 --> 28:02.406
But sooner or later,
she is gonna get

28:02.510 --> 28:03.841
what she deserves.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.406
And I do not want you
standing too close

28:05.510 --> 28:06.704
when that happens.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.277
_ So_ all of this is
just Sisterly concern?

28:09.380 --> 28:11.416
Is it really
that hard to believe?

28:11.520 --> 28:13.715
What did you do,
Melissa?

28:15.120 --> 28:18.180
And I'm asking you
to your face this time.

28:19.830 --> 28:21.252
I can't tell you.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.952
Not yet.

28:23.060 --> 28:24.789
You're my sister!

28:24.900 --> 28:26.322
Does_ that mean
nothing to you?

28:26.430 --> 28:28.239
It means
you should know that...

28:29.540 --> 28:31.269
honesty does not come
easy for this family.

28:31.370 --> 28:33.702
Okay, well, we can improve
upon our genetics, huh?

28:33.840 --> 28:34.704
Let's at least try.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.137
I'm trying, Spencer!

28:42.880 --> 28:44.814
It is not safe
for me here...

28:45.850 --> 28:46.987
or for you.

28:50.460 --> 28:52.052
Maybe you should
come with me.

28:56.160 --> 29:00.392
( door creaking )

29:08.540 --> 29:11.145
This is where he said
he kept you.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.138
The property has been
abandoned for years.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.445
Not a lot of neighbors
around either.

29:20.890 --> 29:22.448
Al, you okay?

29:26.990 --> 29:29.026
Cyrus Petrillo
may have confessed,

29:29.160 --> 29:30.491
but we don't have
the physical evidence

29:30.600 --> 29:31.897
we need to charge him

29:32.000 --> 29:34.389
and our 48-hour
hold is running out.

29:36.370 --> 29:38.258
I know this is difficult,

29:38.370 --> 29:41.032
but since you can't identify
your abductor,

29:41.140 --> 29:43.108
I need you to try

29:43.210 --> 29:44.438
and remember this space.

29:46.010 --> 29:47.045
( door shuts )

29:53.290 --> 29:55.850
Come on.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.019
I want you
to meet my friends.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.485
CYRUS: This is crazy.

30:00.590 --> 30:01.955
Hey, guys.

30:02.060 --> 30:03.095
This is Cyrus.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.063
Hey!

30:13.210 --> 30:14.199
My bag!

30:15.610 --> 30:17.305
Hey, get off me!

30:31.260 --> 30:32.557
( screams )

31:03.620 --> 31:05.520
You remember this place?

31:09.630 --> 31:11.222
I can never forget it.

31:25.010 --> 31:25.977
( Hanna sighs)

31:26.080 --> 31:27.308
How long
before they release him?

31:27.410 --> 31:28.877
According to
Tanner's emails,

31:28.980 --> 31:30.140
it could be any minute.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.184
He could go out the front
or the back.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.281
Well, I would say
we should split up,

31:34.390 --> 31:37.109
but I wouldn't trust you
telling me what you saw.

31:37.220 --> 31:39.154
Well,
the feeling's mutual.

31:39.290 --> 31:41.099
( indistinct chatter on radio )

31:41.200 --> 31:42.349
Why did you tell
Miss Adinolfi

31:42.460 --> 31:44.098
that you fainted
because of a panic attack?

31:44.200 --> 31:45.895
Because I did.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.524
Since when do you have
panic attacks?

31:47.630 --> 31:50.133
Since when do you get sauced
before third period?

31:52.210 --> 31:53.973
Well, I'll say it
if you won't.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.604
Since Ali came back.

31:56.980 --> 31:58.379
Why do you think
I went on the offensive?

31:58.480 --> 32:00.345
She scares me
to death.

32:00.450 --> 32:02.509
Ijust...

32:02.620 --> 32:04.349
didn't want to
face her alone.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.951
( cell phone ringing )

32:10.060 --> 32:11.322
Hey, Caleb.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.052
Sorry, I haven't
called you back.

32:14.230 --> 32:15.527
The audition?

32:15.630 --> 32:16.995
It went great.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.522
But there were
a lot of other girls there,

32:18.630 --> 32:21.064
so I probably won't get it.

32:21.170 --> 32:24.105
Um, but I'm just about to
sit down with my mom for dinner

32:24.210 --> 32:27.338
so I'll call you after,
okay?

32:27.470 --> 32:29.233
Okay, bye.

32:30.640 --> 32:33.200
Lying to your boyfriend
again.

32:33.310 --> 32:34.277
Nice.

32:34.380 --> 32:35.938
Oh, please.

32:36.050 --> 32:38.939
Like Mike Montgomery knows
a single real thing about you.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.112
TANNER: ( on radio )
170 to Control.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.950
Witness has identified
5th Street house.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.489
ETA to the courthouse,
8 minutes.

32:46.630 --> 32:49.428
Do not release suspect
in holding.

32:49.530 --> 32:53.694
I repeat,
do not release Cyrus Petrillo.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.360
I'm the one
confusing things, Em.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.364
I can't trust Ezra.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.058
I don't.

32:59.170 --> 33:00.706
And people don't just change
because you want them to.

33:00.810 --> 33:02.607
( knocking on door)

33:02.710 --> 33:04.644
Hey, can I call you back?

33:04.750 --> 33:06.149
I heard that you went out.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.672
What's in the bag?

33:07.780 --> 33:10.214
My attempt to jumpstart
my single life.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.039
I may have gone
a little overboard.

33:13.150 --> 33:15.380
Would you wear this?

33:16.520 --> 33:17.748
Yes.

33:17.860 --> 33:19.282
Which is why
you shouldn't.

33:19.390 --> 33:21.255
Ithoughtso.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.692
So you're talking
again...

33:24.800 --> 33:27.598
to Ezra.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.669
Oh, that was just Emily
on the phone.

33:31.810 --> 33:32.708
But, yeah,

33:32.810 --> 33:35.005
we're--we're talking.

33:37.180 --> 33:40.604
Honey, I went through
two boxes of tissues yesterday

33:40.710 --> 33:44.419
and bared my soul to you
about thirteen times.

33:44.550 --> 33:46.518
You can talk to me.

33:46.620 --> 33:49.009
Please.

33:51.090 --> 33:54.457
I thought he was gone,
Mom.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.096
Really gone.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.421
The whole time
he was in the hospital,

34:00.570 --> 34:05.166
I was just
making up this list

34:05.270 --> 34:08.433
of the things that I'd tell him
if I just got one more chance.

34:10.110 --> 34:13.409
And now he's okay

34:13.510 --> 34:15.819
and I'm so glad
that he's okay.

34:17.350 --> 34:20.786
But I'm just--
I'm stuck with that list still.

34:20.890 --> 34:23.586
And there's all these thoughts
and there's all these feelings

34:23.720 --> 34:25.449
that are just bashing
around in my head

34:25.560 --> 34:27.448
every single time
that I see him.

34:31.430 --> 34:34.831
And I want to be able
to trust him again.

34:36.200 --> 34:37.736
Just start over.

34:40.740 --> 34:43.732
But you're right,
people don't change.

34:47.350 --> 34:50.615
Aria, honey,
that's not true.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.517
People can change.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.713
I know
because I've changed.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.151
You've changed.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.558
Even your dad has changed.

34:58.660 --> 34:59.820
Your dad was the one

34:59.930 --> 35:01.795
who got me up
off the couch this morning.

35:01.900 --> 35:05.222
Okay,
it was the ricotta pancakes.

35:05.330 --> 35:06.490
I know
it's a small thing,

35:06.600 --> 35:09.296
but he used to be incapable
of making anything

35:09.400 --> 35:11.095
in a skillet
without turning it black.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.771
Mom, you don't have to try
to make me feel better.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.245
Aria, listen to me.

35:19.350 --> 35:21.773
I don't know what exactly
happened with Ezra,

35:21.880 --> 35:23.472
but I do know that Zack

35:23.580 --> 35:27.243
is not gonna write the book
on relationships in this family.

35:27.350 --> 35:29.386
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.659
( cell phone beeps )

35:37.430 --> 35:38.761
Is that him?

35:54.420 --> 35:55.569
Em?

35:57.920 --> 35:59.683
Ali,
can I talk to you?

35:59.820 --> 36:01.583
Dad,
I'll be right in.

36:03.290 --> 36:04.689
Okay.

36:10.930 --> 36:11.897
You heard.

36:12.000 --> 36:12.898
Yeah.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.468
But I didn't understand.

36:15.570 --> 36:17.561
You identified him?

36:17.700 --> 36:19.236
Ali, I thought
we were in this together.

36:19.340 --> 36:20.500
We are.
No.

36:20.610 --> 36:21.907
We're not.

36:22.010 --> 36:23.307
Whatever "A" has planned

36:23.410 --> 36:24.900
affects all of us,
not just you.

36:25.010 --> 36:27.399
I waited as long as I could.

36:27.510 --> 36:30.843
Everyone was looking at me,
being in that place.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.242
You weren't there, Em.

36:32.350 --> 36:33.248
VVhen?

36:33.350 --> 36:35.318
When wasn't I there?

36:35.420 --> 36:37.479
When Hanna broke her leg
because of "A"?

36:37.590 --> 36:39.319
When I almost died
in an elevator

36:39.460 --> 36:41.451
because I was trying to find out
who killed you?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.488
Or when Spencer
had to check into Radley

36:43.600 --> 36:45.898
because of everything your
disappearance put us through?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.833
The past several years
haven't been easy for any of us,

36:48.940 --> 36:51.408
but what makes it okay
is that we stick together.

36:51.510 --> 36:52.499
We don't turn on each other.

36:52.610 --> 36:53.508
I have a plan.

36:53.610 --> 36:54.975
Oh, I'm sure you do.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.877
The problem is
you'll throw us all under a bus

36:57.010 --> 36:58.307
just to pull it off.

37:00.450 --> 37:02.816
I stuck up for you

37:02.920 --> 37:06.242
against Paige,
against Spencer,

37:06.350 --> 37:07.886
against everyone.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.282
I wasted so much time
on you.

37:14.360 --> 37:15.349
Emily.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.488
I'm gonna make it
ﬁght

37:18.630 --> 37:20.769
Iam.

37:20.870 --> 37:22.997
I can still find out
who "A" is.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.431
Please.

37:24.540 --> 37:27.509
I'm done, Ali.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.471
I am so done with you.

37:45.860 --> 37:48.749
If All identified the guy,
then how did he get away?

37:48.860 --> 37:51.761
Once the clock struck 8: 10,
he was a free man.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.998
"A" must have had
a getaway car out back.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.694
By the time Tanner called
in the ID, he was gone.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.958
Gone or not, "A" could
still use this against you.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.401
Yeah, I know.

38:02.540 --> 38:03.939
But Spencer has a plan.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.439
A good one?
No.

38:05.550 --> 38:06.676
It's awful.

38:06.780 --> 38:09.044
Even for Spencer.

38:09.150 --> 38:10.879
( indistinct whispering )

38:10.980 --> 38:12.516
Look, I'm sorry, Caleb.

38:12.620 --> 38:13.882
I shouldn't have
lied to you.

38:13.990 --> 38:16.288
Ijust...

38:17.460 --> 38:18.722
After everything
I said yesterday,

38:18.830 --> 38:20.980
I didn't want to tell you
that I was in a car

38:21.090 --> 38:22.819
with Mona spying on Ali.

38:24.430 --> 38:27.593
Hanna,
we can't get control back

38:27.700 --> 38:30.294
by avoiding
what's going on.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.702
If it makes you
feel any better...

38:35.580 --> 38:38.003
I didn't exactly have
a kale salad for lunch.

38:38.110 --> 38:39.008
No?

38:39.110 --> 38:41.419
Try a bacon calzone.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.884
Give me a call
if you need anything, okay?

38:46.990 --> 38:48.912
I will.

38:49.020 --> 38:50.453
I love you.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.028
"Sooner or later,

39:00.130 --> 39:01.324
Ali's gonna get
what she deserves."

39:01.440 --> 39:02.589
That's what she said?
Yeah.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.059
Melissa basically admitted

39:04.170 --> 39:07.606
that "A" has something terrible
in store for All and us.

39:07.710 --> 39:09.928
Look, it's not too late,
Aria.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.473
We can go to Tanner.

39:11.580 --> 39:12.842
We can tell her the truth
about Ali.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.372
God, no.
I know.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.744
You've mentioned that
like 16 times already.

39:16.850 --> 39:18.078
Fine.

39:20.890 --> 39:22.687
What are you smiling
about?

39:22.790 --> 39:24.883
It's just a smile,
Spencen

39:25.030 --> 39:26.986
Don't sound so concerned.

39:27.090 --> 39:27.988
Any word on Emily?

39:28.090 --> 39:29.626
No, not yet.

39:29.730 --> 39:30.924
You guys, I know I said
that this might happen,

39:31.030 --> 39:32.827
but I still can't believe it.

39:32.930 --> 39:36.491
A|i walking into an "A" trap
with both eyes open?

39:36.640 --> 39:38.505
Me neither.

39:39.740 --> 39:40.764
Em?

39:40.910 --> 39:41.808
Are you okay?

39:41.910 --> 39:44.105
You were right,
Spencen

39:44.210 --> 39:45.108
We can't trust Alison.

39:45.210 --> 39:46.768
Not after tonight.

39:46.880 --> 39:47.949
Not you, too.

39:49.950 --> 39:51.918
Look, I know that this affects
you more than the rest of us.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.449
Okay, I know that.

39:53.550 --> 39:54.983
But I really hope
you can get on board.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.650
We need to cut ties
with All now.

39:57.790 --> 39:59.052
Tonight.

40:15.980 --> 40:18.744
I was beginning to think
you might not show.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.678
There's a warrant out
for my arrest.

40:22.820 --> 40:23.946
I barely made it out
inﬁme

40:24.050 --> 40:26.018
That wasn't the deal
we made.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.053
You're lucky
there was even a deal at all.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.896
I should have left you for dead
when I found you.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.033
No one would miss you, Cy.

40:44.140 --> 40:45.960
Not for a second.

40:51.040 --> 40:54.043
You know I could have told them
the truth about you.

40:54.150 --> 40:55.572
How we met.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.588
All the fun
we had together.

40:59.650 --> 41:01.754
So could I.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.681
Then we'd both lose.

41:04.790 --> 41:05.825
Now we both win.

41:10.730 --> 41:13.460
I found you once

41:13.570 --> 41:15.834
and you can bet your life
I can find you again.

41:17.900 --> 41:21.028
This is your one chance
to start over, Cy.

41:21.140 --> 41:22.732
You better use it.

41:24.980 --> 41:26.845
The way you've used it,
Ali?

41:35.020 --> 41:36.715
( engine starting )

41:58.780 --> 42:02.773
Spencer, you're right.

42:02.880 --> 42:06.281
I have to tell you the truth
before it's too late.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.512
MAN: ( on TV)
If you're just joining us,

42:12.860 --> 42:14.179
you're watching the 42nd
annual Pennsylvania dog show.

42:14.330 --> 42:15.194
WOMAN: ( on TV)
Let's check back in

42:15.330 --> 42:16.524
with our...

42:16.660 --> 42:18.662
( TV chatter continues )
