00:07.933 --> 00:09.267
- *

00:09.367 --> 00:13.800
- Uh, chicken wings, uh,
tots, onion rings, and splat.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.700
- Yep, we got a jam.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.967
- Should we get
the tube sweeper?

00:22.067 --> 00:24.167
- Nah, it's being used
by table five.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.600
- Yeah, let's switch tables.

00:27.700 --> 00:28.700
- Maybe I can help.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.100
- Let's stay.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.333
- Whoo, hey, thanks.

00:35.433 --> 00:38.500
- You wanna thank me,
let me buy you lunch sometime.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.300
- We haven't paid
for this mess yet.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.900
- Sorry, I'm...kinda into paying
for my own meals right now.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.033
- And her best friend.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.800
She also pays
for her best friend.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.067
- Well, it was nice
talking to you.

00:55.167 --> 00:56.500
- Uh, I'm just not ready
to date again yet.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.600
It hasn't been that long
since Link moved.

01:00.267 --> 01:02.700
- I guess I'll know
when I get a sign.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.900
- Sorry, let me get this.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.900
Oh, it's not me.

01:10.067 --> 01:12.100
- Yeah, it's him.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.267
- Oh, sorry. I don't know how

01:14.367 --> 01:17.133
"Classical Cats Volume 2"
got on my phone.

01:17.233 --> 01:19.067
- I have the same ringtone.

01:19.100 --> 01:22.600
- Okay. I lied,
I put that on my phone.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.800
Who needs Mozart
when you can have Meow

01:27.500 --> 01:30.167
- Wait. You're reading
"The Yellow Bandana?"

01:30.267 --> 01:32.167
- It's kinda
my favorite book.

01:32.267 --> 01:33.867
- Get out!
It's my favorite book.

01:33.967 --> 01:35.167
I've read it like five times.

01:35.267 --> 01:36.400
And I've even listened
to the audiobook.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.667
- Have you heard
the one read by cats?

01:41.533 --> 01:43.567
- No,
but that would be awesome.

01:45.467 --> 01:47.767
- Oh, thank you, good sir.

01:47.867 --> 01:50.933
Well...it was nice to meet you.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.100
- Nice to meet you, too.

01:56.233 --> 01:58.300
So, like I was saying, um, yeah,

01:58.400 --> 02:00.767
I'll know it's time
to date again when I get a sign.

02:00.867 --> 02:03.667
- Phoebe, I'm not usually
ahead of you on these things--

02:03.767 --> 02:06.433
- Great Meow-zart's ghost,
that was like a million signs.

02:11.067 --> 02:12.767
- Donate
to the hoverboard foundation?

02:14.300 --> 02:16.467
- Buying me a hoverboard.

02:16.567 --> 02:19.333
- Well, in that case,
here's an onion ring.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.267
- I never liked you.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.367
- I missed him.

02:26.467 --> 02:27.733
I guess it's not meant to be.

02:29.067 --> 02:30.767
Look, he left his book.

02:30.867 --> 02:32.367
- Oh.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.900
Well, I guess I could
just hold onto this

02:35.067 --> 02:36.533
in case I run into him again.

02:36.633 --> 02:38.567
Come on, let's pay
and get out of here.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.800
It's for charity.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.600
- * What you see
is not what you get *

02:54.700 --> 02:57.733
* Living our lives
with a secret *

02:57.833 --> 03:01.067
* We fit right in,
bet you'd never guess *

03:01.100 --> 03:04.400
* Because we're living our lives
just like all the rest *

03:04.500 --> 03:08.067
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

03:08.100 --> 03:11.233
* But closer you might see
the crazy things we do *

03:11.333 --> 03:12.933
* This isn't make-believe

03:13.067 --> 03:14.367
* It's our reality

03:14.467 --> 03:17.367
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

03:17.467 --> 03:19.133
* And stay out of trouble

03:19.233 --> 03:21.800
* Living a double life *

03:25.967 --> 03:27.733
- *

03:27.833 --> 03:29.800
- Donate
to the hoverboard foundation.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.467
Every penny counts.

03:32.567 --> 03:34.467
Unless it's a penny.

03:38.267 --> 03:39.900
Ugh!
- Eh!

03:41.867 --> 03:46.567
- Cherry, prepare
to have your mind blown.

03:46.667 --> 03:47.933
Bam!

03:48.067 --> 03:50.633
- Whoa! Two books!

03:50.733 --> 03:52.400
I don't get it.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.500
- Check it out.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.800
This is my copy
of "The Yellow Bandana."

03:54.900 --> 03:56.067
This is my crush's copy.

03:56.133 --> 03:58.400
Here.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.333
I underlined this sentence.

04:00.433 --> 04:01.800
He underlined this sentence.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.933
Look, I put a star
next to this part.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.800
He did, too.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.067
- Uh, that's just a food stain.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.633
It's like you're soulmates.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.233
- Yeah, well,
none of that matters,

04:15.333 --> 04:16.467
because it's been
like five days,

04:16.567 --> 04:18.100
and I still
haven't run into him.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.300
Maybe I never will.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.400
- Hey, what if you use
your super powers

04:21.500 --> 04:22.833
to freeze everyone in town,

04:22.933 --> 04:24.200
then dig through
the lifeless bodies

04:24.300 --> 04:27.533
until you find him?

04:27.633 --> 04:29.533
- This is why
you're not a superhero.

04:31.167 --> 04:32.567
- What about
your Hero League tablet?

04:32.667 --> 04:35.233
Don't you have some kind
of search for a bad guy app?

04:35.333 --> 04:36.867
- Yeah, that thing
can find anyone.

04:36.967 --> 04:39.200
But it's for official
Hero League business only.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.667
They call it Find a Fiend.

04:40.767 --> 04:45.600
Not Find a Cute Guy or May
or May Not Be Perfect For You.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.700
Look, if it's meant to be,
it's meant to be.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.067
After school, I'm just gonna go
to Splat Burger,

04:50.100 --> 04:53.933
sit quietly, and wait for fate
to bring him back to me.

04:54.067 --> 04:55.367
Seriously?

04:55.467 --> 04:57.500
Nobody here's seen the boy
reading this book

05:00.233 --> 05:03.400
- *

05:03.500 --> 05:05.867
- Not even close to enough money
for a hoverboard.

05:08.833 --> 05:11.067
What are we going to do now,
Colosso?

05:11.100 --> 05:13.333
- COLOSSO: We use
the old metal detector.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.133
- Oh, I'm getting a hit already.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.333
- I'm gonna hit you.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.367
That's the can.

05:20.467 --> 05:21.567
- Burn! Burn!

05:21.667 --> 05:25.067
- Burn! Burn! Burn, ninja! Burn!

05:25.133 --> 05:28.867
- Okay, that's enough
ninja burn for one day.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.933
That's the whole question,
just why.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.800
- We were at some kind
of ninja birthday party.

05:37.900 --> 05:39.767
- It's called
"Ninja Burners," Dad.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.133
- "Ninja Burners"
is our favorite show.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.300
- Oh, right,
I saw that on the DVR...

05:44.400 --> 05:46.067
right before I erased it.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.900
- Ninja Burn!
- Hold it!

05:48.067 --> 05:50.667
Whoa, whoa, that ninja party
was a bad idea.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.433
- No way, it was awesome.

05:52.533 --> 05:54.067
They had a ninja piÃ±ata.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.300
Pin the tail on the ninja.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.800
And ninja nachos.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.067
They're nachos
with a jalapeno kick.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.433
- Hey!

06:00.533 --> 06:02.067
- And the Ninja Burners
were there.

06:02.133 --> 06:04.067
Can we get them for
our birthday parties this year?

06:04.133 --> 06:05.200
- Absolutely not.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.700
Those party performers
are way too expensive.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.100
- But you just wasted money
buying Chloe crayons.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.800
- Don't drag me into this.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.133
- Crayons are not
a waste of money.

06:15.233 --> 06:18.433
Especially when you get them
for free at a restaurant.

06:18.533 --> 06:20.733
- Chloe just wants
to color pictures of her family,

06:20.833 --> 06:23.833
not watch three pretend ninjas
slap each other around

06:23.933 --> 06:25.400
for $100 an hour.

06:28.400 --> 06:32.567
Sorry, just choked
on a new plan.

06:32.667 --> 06:33.767
- Let's go hang out
with the one kid

06:33.867 --> 06:36.067
who isn't kicking or spitting.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.700
- Hey, how would you two
like to teach me

06:42.800 --> 06:45.300
everything you know
about "Ninja Burners"

06:45.400 --> 06:47.700
so I can make
some hoverboard money?

06:47.800 --> 06:49.667
- Seems like
he's up to something.

06:49.767 --> 06:52.400
- He just told you
what he's up to.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
And for the record,
it'll never work.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.967
"Ninja Burners" always travel
in groups of three.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.467
- It's the ninja code.

06:58.567 --> 07:00.433
- Well, then you guys
can be ninjas, too.

07:00.533 --> 07:01.500
- I'm in.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.733
As long as you keep the money.

07:02.833 --> 07:05.233
I don't mix
business with pleasure.

07:05.333 --> 07:06.533
- I do.

07:06.633 --> 07:09.633
I want 10% of all profits
and a $5 signing bonus.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.167
- I'll you some loose change
and a dead battery.

07:11.267 --> 07:13.133
- Deal.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.933
- Hey, before you settle
on those two, check this out.

07:17.067 --> 07:19.733
Keeee-ya.

07:19.833 --> 07:23.233
Keee-ow!

07:23.333 --> 07:25.867
- *

07:28.067 --> 07:32.433
This book is all I
have left of you, Mystery Crush.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.600
- It doesn't have to be.
- Ah!

07:34.700 --> 07:37.600
- Don't worry, I'm here, too.
- Ah!

07:37.700 --> 07:39.167
- Come on,
you know you wanna use

07:39.267 --> 07:40.433
Find a Fiend to get that boy.

07:40.533 --> 07:42.133
Just do it.

07:42.233 --> 07:44.167
- Oh, I get it.

07:44.267 --> 07:45.867
Angel Phoebe, Devil Phoebe.

07:45.967 --> 07:49.067
All right, Angel Phoebe,
tell me why I shouldn't do it.

07:49.167 --> 07:50.933
- Abusing
your Hero League privileges

07:51.067 --> 07:52.133
would be wrong.

07:52.233 --> 07:53.467
- Thank you.

07:53.567 --> 07:55.067
- Unless...

07:55.100 --> 07:56.533
Tell her the unless.

07:56.633 --> 07:58.200
- Unless you do it
really, really quick

07:58.300 --> 07:59.467
so no one finds out.

07:59.567 --> 08:01.400
That's kinda like
not even doing it.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.067
- That's not
very angel like at all.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.667
Handing out halos
to just anyone these days?

08:05.767 --> 08:07.600
- Come on,
I really like him, okay?

08:07.700 --> 08:08.767
And all those signs.

08:08.867 --> 08:11.133
I really wanna see
where this goes.

08:11.233 --> 08:13.267
- But if I use Find a Fiend,
I have to label my crush

08:13.367 --> 08:14.900
as a dangerous criminal.

08:15.067 --> 08:17.067
- Well, he is dangerously cute.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.833
- And he's the first guy
you've liked since Link.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.467
All right, fine, if you guys
both think I should do it,

08:24.567 --> 08:25.833
then I'll do it.

08:25.933 --> 08:27.667
- Uh, actually,
you're already doing it.

08:27.767 --> 08:29.267
While Angel Phoebe and I
were distracting you,

08:29.367 --> 08:33.467
IT Phoebe logged you
into the Find a Fiend app.

08:33.567 --> 08:34.600
- You're in.

08:34.700 --> 08:38.800
Uh, I also backed you up
to the Cloud.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.767
- *

08:43.100 --> 08:46.100
- Max, how did you make
such amazing costumes?

08:46.200 --> 08:48.667
- I got a guy
who's a ninja with a needle.

08:48.767 --> 08:52.600
- Wah, wah, wah, wah!

08:52.700 --> 08:56.767
- Uh-oh, Barb,
he's starting a ninja army.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.900
- Relax, we're just
getting ready for our audition

08:59.067 --> 09:00.633
to be birthday party performers.

09:00.733 --> 09:03.733
I'd never start a ninja army.
Ha!

09:03.833 --> 09:06.100
Start ninja army.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.433
- Oh, Chloe.

09:07.533 --> 09:08.633
Since you're done drawing Max,

09:08.733 --> 09:11.433
why don't you come in
and draw Mommy and Daddy?

09:11.533 --> 09:14.567
- Nope. But I'll draw the couch.

09:14.667 --> 09:15.633
- Maybe you can draw

09:15.733 --> 09:17.633
Mommy and Daddy
sitting on the couch.

09:17.733 --> 09:19.067
- Nope.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.267
- All right,

09:22.367 --> 09:23.467
that lady and her kid
should be any minute.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.100
Let's practice.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.633
Chay, chay, chay!

09:27.733 --> 09:30.300
- Max, Ninja Burners
don't say "chee-yah."

09:30.400 --> 09:32.067
They say, "Burn," remember?

09:32.167 --> 09:33.067
- Right.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.867
Burn! Burn! Burn!
- Whoo!

09:36.967 --> 09:39.367
You're getting there.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.967
- Hey. Thanks for teaching me
all this stuff, guys.

09:42.067 --> 09:43.633
- Maybe when you get
your hoverboard,

09:43.733 --> 09:46.167
you can let us ride us.
- Sssh, here they come.

09:46.267 --> 09:47.833
- Uh!

09:47.933 --> 09:49.700
- Hi, I'm Mrs. Garcia.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.900
- Of course.

09:51.067 --> 09:53.367
And you must be Winter.
I'm Max.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.533
Just kick somebody.

09:56.633 --> 09:58.433
- Okay.

09:58.533 --> 10:03.133
Ninja Burners...burn!

10:13.233 --> 10:14.233
- ALL: Burn!

10:14.333 --> 10:15.833
- Awesome!

10:15.933 --> 10:18.400
- Winter likes you.
You're hired!

10:18.500 --> 10:19.533
- ALL: Yes!

10:19.633 --> 10:20.633
- No.

10:20.733 --> 10:22.600
Just the red one.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.633
The yellow one
lacks the ninja spirit.

10:24.733 --> 10:26.600
And the blue one has a bow.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.867
Bows are my thing.

10:28.967 --> 10:30.167
- Sorry,

10:30.267 --> 10:32.733
but Ninja Burners always travel
in groups of three.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.567
- It's the ninja code.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.233
Guys, go inside.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.267
You're not old enough to hear
what I'm about to say.

10:39.833 --> 10:42.767
If you think for one minute
that I'm doing this party

10:42.867 --> 10:44.967
without my brother and sister...

10:45.067 --> 10:49.067
then you're absolutely right.

10:49.167 --> 10:52.300
- THUNDER MONITOR: Alert! Alert!
Cherry approaching.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.867
- CHERRY: Ugh!

10:53.967 --> 10:57.167
- THUNDER MONITOR: Alert, alert!

11:03.067 --> 11:06.233
- I could have sworn
there was a third step there.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.433
- Don't worry,
you'll get it next time.

11:08.533 --> 11:10.833
- So, what's the news
about your mystery crush?

11:10.933 --> 11:12.067
Did you find him?

11:12.100 --> 11:14.067
- No, but I did use
the Find a Fiend app

11:14.100 --> 11:15.533
to start tracking him down.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.867
- Ooh, you devil you.

11:17.967 --> 11:20.200
- You have no idea.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.067
So, once the system sends me
his coordinates,

11:22.167 --> 11:24.500
I'm going to pretend
to run into him.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.233
Do my flirty laugh.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.633
And then he'll never
escape me again.

11:29.733 --> 11:31.067
- THUNDER MONITOR: Alert, alert,

11:31.100 --> 11:34.633
incoming transmission
from Super President Kick Butt.

11:34.733 --> 11:35.967
- Hello, Phoebe.

11:36.067 --> 11:39.400
I see you've been using
our Find a Fiend program.

11:40.733 --> 11:41.967
- When someone
of your skill level

11:42.067 --> 11:43.800
registers a dangerous criminal,

11:43.900 --> 11:45.833
the Hero League
is always notified.

11:45.933 --> 11:48.167
That way,
we can send a strike team.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.400
That sounds awfully strikey.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.633
- Oh, they are.

11:54.733 --> 11:57.067
A group of our best men
and women guaranteed

11:57.133 --> 12:00.533
to find your dangerous criminal
and take him out.

12:00.633 --> 12:04.333
- Don't you want him
to take you out?

12:04.433 --> 12:07.900
- What's the fruit girl
talking about?

12:08.067 --> 12:11.167
- Actually, Super President,
you are gonna laugh.

12:11.267 --> 12:12.867
Uh, there's actually something
you should know

12:12.967 --> 12:15.067
about my dangerous criminal

12:15.167 --> 12:16.600
before you send in
that strike team.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.133
- Too late.

12:18.233 --> 12:20.867
- *

12:30.267 --> 12:31.733
- I am so proud of you, Phoebe.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.667
Your first big man hunt.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.733
I hope you catch your guy.

12:35.833 --> 12:36.900
- Or not.

12:37.067 --> 12:39.200
It'd be fine if I didn't.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.667
- Hey, Chloe.

12:40.767 --> 12:42.833
You ready to draw
Mommy and Daddy?

12:42.933 --> 12:45.933
- Nope, strike team.

12:46.067 --> 12:48.533
- Well, maybe you can draw us
when you're done.

12:48.633 --> 12:50.833
- Nope.

12:50.933 --> 12:52.633
- Don't cry, Hank.

12:52.733 --> 12:56.467
She'll know we're weak.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.900
- Cherry, I feel awful.

12:58.067 --> 13:00.667
- Yeah, you really
don't look that good.

13:00.767 --> 13:01.933
- No, I mean,

13:02.067 --> 13:04.367
all I wanted to do
was track down a boy I liked.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.067
- And now you have
a whole strike team

13:06.100 --> 13:07.300
to do it for you.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.267
You have time to rest up
and feel better.

13:10.367 --> 13:11.967
- I'm not sick.

13:12.067 --> 13:13.367
I am putting an end to it.

13:13.467 --> 13:15.533
It's time to call
President Kickbutt.

13:15.633 --> 13:17.900
- We got your guy.

13:18.067 --> 13:19.233
We just spotted him
buying a ticket

13:19.333 --> 13:21.533
for the 3:15 screening
of "Maze Jumper 3."

13:21.633 --> 13:23.067
- O-M crazy!

13:23.133 --> 13:24.967
That's your favorite
movie franchise.

13:25.067 --> 13:26.267
- Time to strike!

13:26.367 --> 13:28.800
- No, don't strike.

13:28.900 --> 13:31.167
- Well, uh, I'll tell you why.

13:31.267 --> 13:34.167
Because...that's not my guy.

13:34.267 --> 13:36.833
- But it fits the description
you logged into the program.

13:36.933 --> 13:39.900
Blonde hair, green eyes,
soul of poet.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.467
- You forgot smile
that lights up a room.

13:42.567 --> 13:46.800
But, uh, actually, Cherry
got a much better look at him.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.400
- Well, we'll need to ask you
a few questions.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.167
- Uh, you can ask her
more than a few.

13:50.267 --> 13:54.567
You can ask a bunch, a load,
a whole gaggle of questions

13:54.667 --> 13:57.067
right after we chat real quick.
Okay? Cool. Thanks.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.200
Did you see that picture?

14:01.300 --> 14:02.767
My guy's even cuter
than I remembered.

14:02.867 --> 14:03.933
And like you said,

14:04.067 --> 14:05.700
we have the same
favorite movie franchise.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.467
He is on fire!

14:10.133 --> 14:12.133
The movie is two hours long,

14:12.233 --> 14:14.933
which gives me enough time
to change and go meet my crush

14:15.067 --> 14:16.633
while you come up with
some crazy description

14:16.733 --> 14:17.867
of someone who doesn't exist.

14:20.333 --> 14:23.067
- No, Cherry,
a human that doesn't exist.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.433
- You know, actually,
my uncle is a big foot hunter,

14:25.533 --> 14:27.067
and he--
- Cherry!

14:27.167 --> 14:29.433
Just make him a boy, okay?

14:29.533 --> 14:31.800
I need them off chasing some guy
you dreamed up

14:31.900 --> 14:34.867
so I can go chase
the guy of my dreams.

14:34.967 --> 14:36.333
- On it.
- Thank you.

14:38.133 --> 14:41.467
- All right, Strikers,
here's what our man looked like.

14:41.567 --> 14:46.433
He had a--ugh!

14:46.533 --> 14:49.833
I could have sworn
there was a step there.

14:49.933 --> 14:52.467
- *

14:55.733 --> 14:58.600
- Burn!
- Ahh! Tiny ninjas!

14:58.700 --> 15:00.900
- We knew you'd go to
the birthday party without us.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.167
- You lied.

15:02.267 --> 15:04.167
And we were just starting
to have fun together.

15:04.267 --> 15:05.333
- You're right.

15:05.433 --> 15:07.800
I'm gonna give myself
a stern talking to.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.433
You guys
should probably go inside.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.800
You're not old enough
to hear what I'm about to say.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.067
- Nobody's falling for that.

15:14.167 --> 15:17.067
Billy, get back here!

15:17.167 --> 15:19.167
- Okay, look, I'm sorry.

15:19.267 --> 15:22.067
I just really need that money
for the hoverboard and--

15:22.167 --> 15:24.767
wait, how did you guys
even know I was going?

15:24.867 --> 15:26.567
- You're Max.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.200
- Cursed my reputation.

15:29.300 --> 15:32.633
- Oh, you're gonna be cursed
all right....by the ninja code.

15:32.733 --> 15:36.133
- BOTH: Wah-ah!

15:38.733 --> 15:41.400
- BOTH: Wah-ah!

15:41.500 --> 15:43.467
- Yeah, that. Stop doing that.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.700
- Legend says that
if you break the ninja code,

15:45.800 --> 15:47.600
it will come back to haunt you.

15:49.133 --> 15:52.367
The Ninja Burners were invented
by a toy company in Fresno.

15:52.467 --> 15:53.533
- You'll see.

15:53.633 --> 15:55.833
- And cursed you will be.

15:55.933 --> 15:58.200
- BOTH: Wah-ha!

15:58.300 --> 16:00.067
- Still see you guys.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.567
- BOTH: Wah-ha!
- Stop doing that!

16:03.667 --> 16:06.267
- *

16:06.367 --> 16:08.067
- Who are you drawing now,
Chloe?

16:08.100 --> 16:09.333
The penguin?

16:09.433 --> 16:12.900
- Because he's the reason
you have nice things.

16:13.067 --> 16:15.067
- I'm drawing Mommy and Daddy.

16:15.133 --> 16:16.233
I

16:16.333 --> 16:17.967
thought you didn't
want to draw us.

16:18.067 --> 16:19.900
- I saved the best for last.

16:20.067 --> 16:21.233
- Aw.

16:21.333 --> 16:24.233
Okay, now we can cry, Hank.

16:24.333 --> 16:25.900
- Not in front
of the strike team.

16:26.067 --> 16:28.567
Let's go cry outside.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.500
- Oh, I gotta draw that.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.967
- I think we found your guy.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.833
- Oh good.

16:35.933 --> 16:37.500
Wait, what?

16:38.367 --> 16:39.567
Uh, how could you?

16:39.667 --> 16:43.900
It wasn't even
a real--really good description.

16:44.067 --> 16:44.900
- He's at Splat Burger.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.833
Strike team strike!

16:46.933 --> 16:49.067
- *

16:49.100 --> 16:50.833
- Phoebe!

16:50.933 --> 16:52.700
Phoebe!

16:55.867 --> 16:56.833
We got a problem.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.400
Ugh, I knew it.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.500
My "Maze Jumper" T-shirt
is too casual to meet my crush.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.467
I'll go change.
- N-n-n-n--

17:04.567 --> 17:08.300
- Cherry, what happened
to the strike team?

17:08.400 --> 17:12.467
- That's why I
"Phoebe! Phoebe!"-ed you.

17:12.567 --> 17:13.667
They went to Splat Burger.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.400
Somehow they found
the guy I gave them.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.967
- Wait, but you
made up a guy, right?

17:17.067 --> 17:20.067
- Yeah, I just described
this drawing.

17:21.400 --> 17:25.967
- No, it's this artist
named "Chow-lay."

17:26.067 --> 17:28.300
- That's how you spell Chloe.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.700
Uh, I have to stop them.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.100
They're going after
an innocent civilian.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.900
An oddly dressed civilian
with two right feet.

17:37.433 --> 17:39.700
If you don't go to that movie,
you may never see him again.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.833
- Well, I have no choice.

17:40.933 --> 17:42.533
This is all my fault.

17:42.633 --> 17:45.833
This fool
better be worth saving.

17:45.933 --> 17:48.200
- *

17:53.867 --> 17:55.133
- Ninja burn!

17:56.567 --> 17:59.500
- Burn!

17:59.600 --> 18:00.900
Burn!

18:04.267 --> 18:07.300
- All right, guys,
it's ninja story time.

18:10.533 --> 18:15.133
There once was a red ninja who
needed money for a hoverboard.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.533
The end.

18:17.633 --> 18:19.467
Now get stuff in this money can,

18:19.567 --> 18:21.933
and don't say anything
to your parents, or it's...

18:22.067 --> 18:24.300
burn, burn, burn!

18:26.067 --> 18:27.333
A nickel?

18:27.433 --> 18:28.900
You can do better than that,
Sweater Vest.

18:35.367 --> 18:36.933
- Excuse me,
can I take your picture?

18:37.067 --> 18:38.300
You look just like my boss.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.067
- I am your boss, Phoebe.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.867
I'm on a stakeout.

18:41.967 --> 18:43.200
- I knew that.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.767
I just didn't
want to blow your cover,

18:44.867 --> 18:48.233
but if you don't wanna be
professional, what-evs.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.333
- You are going to witness
my strike team

18:50.433 --> 18:52.333
take this joker down hard.

18:52.433 --> 18:54.833
He's gonna wish
he was never born!

18:54.933 --> 18:56.500
Man, I love my job.

19:00.067 --> 19:02.900
- *

19:06.567 --> 19:08.100
- You have to stop them.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.333
There's no dangerous criminal.

19:09.433 --> 19:10.767
There never was.

19:10.867 --> 19:12.967
I was just trying
to track down a boy I liked.

19:13.067 --> 19:17.333
- You turned Find a Fiend
into a Find a Date?

19:17.433 --> 19:18.700
- Actually, I was calling it

19:18.800 --> 19:21.933
Find a Cute Guy Who May
or May Not Be Perfect For You.

19:22.067 --> 19:23.367
Point is, I messed up.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.067
That person is totally innocent.

19:25.167 --> 19:28.100
- Strike team, unstrike.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.400
- I wish we could, ma'am.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
But once Bruno's in strike mode,
he's unstoppable.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.200
- *

19:33.300 --> 19:35.067
- Strike!

19:37.667 --> 19:40.367
- This is my party.
Get your own gig.

19:40.467 --> 19:42.400
- A fight scene, how fun!

19:42.500 --> 19:45.600
Rip him in two!

19:45.700 --> 19:47.600
- *

19:53.433 --> 19:57.100
- You're supposed
to say "burn."

20:08.133 --> 20:10.167
- Max!

20:10.267 --> 20:12.667
Strike team, finish him.

20:12.767 --> 20:15.133
- No, strike team, stand down!

20:15.233 --> 20:16.333
False alarm.

20:16.433 --> 20:17.867
- Oh, not yet.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.367
- I'm sorry I abused
my Hero League privileges,

20:28.467 --> 20:29.500
President Kickbutt.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.300
I'll take
whatever punishment's coming.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.533
- I'll let you off
with a warning.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.533
You're not the first one
to misuse Find a Fiend.

20:36.633 --> 20:38.800
How do you think
I met my husband?

20:42.500 --> 20:45.300
- Of course,
I won't be paying you now.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.233
- Thank you for my hoverboard,
Mommy.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.767
- Oh.

20:55.633 --> 20:58.600
That's my money, Sweater Vest!

20:58.700 --> 21:00.300
- *

21:00.400 --> 21:01.533
- Oh, I'm really okay, Cherry.

21:01.633 --> 21:03.767
I mean, sure, he was perfect,

21:03.867 --> 21:07.733
but it's what I get for using
Find a Fiend in the first place.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.067
Hold on one sec.

21:13.067 --> 21:14.833
Okay, I'm back.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.100
- I don't wanna talk about it.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.533
- CODE: Ninja code!

21:18.633 --> 21:20.267
- There's no such thing.

21:20.367 --> 21:21.800
- BOTH: Wah-ha!

21:21.900 --> 21:23.600
- Stop it!

21:23.700 --> 21:25.400
- THUNDER MONITOR:
Alert, alert!

21:28.900 --> 21:31.300
- It's called pizza,
Thunder Monitor.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.633
- Delivery for the Thundermans.

21:35.733 --> 21:39.433
- Phoebe, grab the pizza money
off the counter.

21:39.533 --> 21:40.700
- I mean, hey,
if it's meant to be,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.733
I'm sure
I'll run him into again.

21:42.833 --> 21:46.333
- Oops,
I almost forgot your sodas.

21:46.433 --> 21:48.433
- I mean, I could run
into him anywhere.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.067
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

21:52.100 --> 21:54.867
- And, hey, even if I don't,
there is a silver lining.

21:54.967 --> 22:00.367
At least now I know I'm ready
to start dating again.

22:02.067 --> 22:04.067
- Uh, pizza's here.

22:04.133 --> 22:06.167
- Yeah! Pizza!

22:06.267 --> 22:08.133

22:11.133 --> 22:16.833
