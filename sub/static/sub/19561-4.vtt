<i>We have a breach.
Sector 3, code red.</i>

00:16.152 --> 00:18.082
<i>Repeat... breach in sector 3.</i>

00:18.087 --> 00:21.157
<i>Lead guards
and all personnel report.</i>

00:24.560 --> 00:28.830
<i>Breach in sector 3. Lead guards
and all personnel report.</i>

00:31.633 --> 00:33.133
<i>A breach, sector 3, code red.</i>

00:40.576 --> 00:41.776
Hey!

00:58.327 --> 01:00.327
My gun. He has my gun!

01:20.015 --> 01:21.283
Hi. Kat Carlson.

01:21.284 --> 01:22.644
I work for Scot... Scottie.

01:22.652 --> 01:23.912
Yeah, I know. We met.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.820
Right. We did.

01:25.822 --> 01:28.022
Anyway, there was an emergency,

01:28.024 --> 01:31.054
and Ms. Hargrave can't make
your... appointment.

01:31.060 --> 01:32.630
She asked me to apologize

01:32.631 --> 01:34.329
and to bring you breakfast.

01:34.330 --> 01:37.199
Great.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.902
Um, do all your clients
bring you stuff?

01:40.903 --> 01:44.933
Yeah. Wait. What did you think
it was about, just sex?

01:44.941 --> 01:46.641
Oh, okay.

01:46.643 --> 01:48.043
Well, I should real...

01:48.044 --> 01:50.144
Wait. Come on.
Have breakfast with me.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.882
That's... thank you,

01:53.883 --> 01:55.683
but I should go.

01:55.685 --> 01:58.754
But, uh, did Scottie
give you my number?

01:58.755 --> 02:00.885
Yes, she gave it to me. Why?

02:00.890 --> 02:03.400
I mean, you could've called
or sent over breakfast.

02:03.401 --> 02:06.253
But here you are.

02:06.262 --> 02:08.762
Come on. Just...
Have breakfast with me.

02:10.098 --> 02:12.234
Okay, but...

02:12.235 --> 02:14.165
But just breakfast.

02:21.009 --> 02:23.849
We got a massive gas leak.
It's authorized personnel only.

02:23.850 --> 02:26.076
She's with me.

02:27.883 --> 02:30.383
Southbound big rig swerved
to avoid an accident.

02:30.386 --> 02:33.086
Jumped the rail,
did a face-plant,

02:33.089 --> 02:34.759
and perforated the base
of the tower column

02:34.760 --> 02:37.757
around 4:15 A.M.

02:37.760 --> 02:40.200
Driver's stable
at New York Presbyterian.

02:40.201 --> 02:43.165
Since when does the CIA
work traffic duty?

02:43.166 --> 02:46.166
You didn't call me down here
for a truck crash, Dan.

02:46.169 --> 02:49.137
And we got two
prison guards in ICU.

02:49.138 --> 02:51.073
Guards?

02:51.074 --> 02:53.444
What have you boys
gotten yourselves into?

03:00.082 --> 03:02.442
Operation Davenport.

03:02.452 --> 03:04.912
It's an off-book site
used by the agency

03:04.921 --> 03:06.881
to interrogate enemy combatants.

03:06.889 --> 03:10.228
We had 32, but now five are missing.
We need you to find them.

03:10.229 --> 03:11.826
Last I checked,
black site prisons

03:11.828 --> 03:13.128
are illegal on U.S. soil.

03:13.129 --> 03:15.429
Scottie. Thank god.
- Jack. What's new?

03:15.431 --> 03:16.861
What's your part in all this?

03:16.866 --> 03:18.736
Jack's company
runs cybersecurity

03:18.737 --> 03:20.035
for Davenport.

03:20.036 --> 03:21.436
How do you plan
on keeping this quiet?

03:21.437 --> 03:23.167
Well, we're striking
the facility now.

03:23.172 --> 03:25.502
Cameras, servers...
All the incident data

03:25.508 --> 03:27.808
will be relocated to a level-four
command center in queens.

03:27.810 --> 03:29.480
I'm going to need that footage.

03:29.481 --> 03:31.317
You're not cleared for that.

03:31.318 --> 03:33.114
Your job is to focus
on the manhunt.

03:35.217 --> 03:38.057
Look, Dan, if you want
the prisoners rounded up,

03:38.058 --> 03:39.884
call the U.S. marshals.

03:39.889 --> 03:42.259
If you want the mess you
created handled covertly,

03:42.260 --> 03:43.958
we do this my way.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.098
And I'll need access
to everything.

03:46.099 --> 03:49.025
So tell Jack to shut up
and listen, or I walk.

03:51.266 --> 03:53.066
So how do you want to handle it?

03:55.871 --> 03:57.501
We have five fugitives
loose in Manhattan.

03:57.507 --> 04:01.107
Andre Zidane, bombed
a French embassy in Algeria.

04:01.110 --> 04:03.478
Brian Mayhew, cyber-hactivist

04:03.479 --> 04:07.149
who leaked a cache of top secret
U.S. intelligence data.

04:07.150 --> 04:10.552
Jared Rourke,
founder of Aryan freedom force,

04:10.553 --> 04:13.153
a Montana-based
white nationalist movement.

04:13.156 --> 04:15.786
Chechen separatist,
Viktor Dudin.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.892
And Alex Kota,
a British national.

04:17.894 --> 04:19.954
Part of a cell that killed
an American diplomat

04:19.962 --> 04:21.492
in Pakistan last month.

04:21.497 --> 04:23.227
Some of the world's
deadliest terrorists,

04:23.232 --> 04:25.162
and you want us to hunt them
down all by ourselves?

04:25.168 --> 04:27.435
Operation Davenport's black ops.

04:27.436 --> 04:29.566
The NYPD, the bureau,
and the public

04:29.572 --> 04:31.272
don't know about it
or the breakout.

04:31.274 --> 04:33.034
If we're going to avoid
mass hysteria,

04:33.042 --> 04:34.272
we need to keep it that way.

04:34.277 --> 04:36.277
If the goal was to avoid
mass hysteria,

04:36.279 --> 04:38.379
a friggin' black site shouldn't
have been put in Manhattan.

04:38.381 --> 04:40.281
But it was, and now we need
to find these men.

04:40.283 --> 04:42.213
I want the CCTV feeds

04:42.218 --> 04:44.558
from every bridge and tunnel
routed through to halcyon.

04:44.559 --> 04:46.184
Nez, get to the scene,

04:46.189 --> 04:47.827
see if you can pick up a trail.

04:47.828 --> 04:50.294
Tom, tell homeland we've got
a credible threat,

04:50.295 --> 04:52.993
and you want NYPD to choke
the city's exfil points.

04:52.995 --> 04:55.425
Say the threat is imminent
but not specific.

04:55.431 --> 04:57.931
<i>All units be advised.</i>

04:57.934 --> 04:59.864
<i>We have a level one
mobilization.</i>

04:59.869 --> 05:02.207
<i>Implement shutdown of all
Manhattan Bridges and tunnels</i>

05:02.208 --> 05:05.235
<i>until further notice
from a patrol supervisor.</i>

05:07.342 --> 05:09.272
Ah.

05:09.278 --> 05:10.445
I wanna re-up.

05:10.446 --> 05:12.546
That will get you half.

05:14.149 --> 05:17.285
But maybe we can come
to an arrangement.

05:17.286 --> 05:20.986
I have a sense you're plugged
into law enforcement.

05:20.990 --> 05:22.324
Yeah. And?

05:22.325 --> 05:25.155
And you might have access
to information

05:25.161 --> 05:27.321
that could benefit me
business-wise...

05:27.330 --> 05:29.898
Who the DEA might be targeting,

05:29.899 --> 05:32.239
which of my competitors
might be hit.

05:38.273 --> 05:39.973
I'm good with the half.

05:47.315 --> 05:48.884
You're sure about this?

05:48.885 --> 05:51.385
It's the official
adoption report.

05:51.387 --> 05:54.623
"Christopher, aged four,
last name unknown."

05:54.624 --> 05:57.324
Same Christopher who was
brought into child services

05:57.326 --> 05:59.296
a week after your son
went missing.

05:59.297 --> 06:01.295
"Judge approves change
in legal status,

06:01.297 --> 06:05.233
conferring all parental rights
to frank and Eva Phelps."

06:05.234 --> 06:07.104
Contact information's
in the file.

06:07.105 --> 06:09.363
You're a call away
from finding your boy.

06:12.208 --> 06:13.608
Sorry to interrupt,

06:13.609 --> 06:14.679
but there's something
you need to see.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.477
It's about the truck.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.587
<i>Someone welded reinforced
steel bars on the front end.</i>

06:20.588 --> 06:22.983
<i>This isn't a big rig.
It's a battering ram.</i>

06:22.985 --> 06:26.924
<i>Whoever launched it knew exactly what
was on the other side of that wall.</i>

06:26.925 --> 06:29.183
This wasn't an accident.
It was a prison break.

06:29.191 --> 06:31.151
Go to the hospital,
get to the driver,

06:31.160 --> 06:33.030
bring him back here,
and lean on him.

06:33.031 --> 06:34.195
It's been five hours,

06:34.196 --> 06:35.466
and we're nowhere
on the escapees.

06:35.467 --> 06:37.194
He's our best hope
of finding them.

06:42.003 --> 06:44.433
Special agent Doug McCarty,
and this is officer lynch.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.178
As I'm sure that
your doctors told you...

06:46.179 --> 06:47.375
They didn't tell me nothing.

06:47.376 --> 06:49.544
Am I in some kind of trouble?

06:49.545 --> 06:51.675
Well, we're not authorized to
release those details at this time,

06:51.681 --> 06:53.271
but we do have
a credible threat.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.442
"Credible threat"?

06:54.450 --> 06:55.690
What the hell does that mean?

06:55.691 --> 06:57.685
What is going on here?

06:57.687 --> 07:00.987
Homeland security believes you may
be a target in an ongoing case.

07:00.990 --> 07:02.027
This about the accident?

07:02.028 --> 07:03.324
I told the police already...

07:03.326 --> 07:05.093
We're moving you
to a secure location

07:05.094 --> 07:06.324
where we can guarantee
your safety

07:06.329 --> 07:07.599
until the threat
is under control.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.664
What threats?
You keep saying that.

07:09.665 --> 07:10.825
If you'll just come this way.

07:13.234 --> 07:15.204
Hey!

07:18.106 --> 07:20.976
Hey! Stop! Hey!

07:20.977 --> 07:22.247
Stop!

07:31.520 --> 07:33.458
Our truck driver
was born in queens.

07:33.459 --> 07:34.725
No criminal record,

07:34.726 --> 07:36.424
nor ties to any known
terror groups.

07:38.259 --> 07:40.198
Uh, still no word
on the prisoners.

07:40.199 --> 07:43.665
Nothing at the airports or the
train stations or the checkpoints.

07:43.666 --> 07:46.436
Well, breaking out of a black site
prison requires planning and manpower,

07:46.437 --> 07:48.503
and a ton of network support.

07:48.504 --> 07:50.034
Well, it did for me.

07:50.039 --> 07:52.009
Oh. So, in addition to
your charming personality,

07:52.010 --> 07:53.438
you're also an enemy combatant.

07:53.442 --> 07:55.342
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wrong place, wrong time.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.744
Whatever you gotta
tell yourself.

07:56.746 --> 07:58.646
Rourke and Mayhew operate alone.

07:58.647 --> 08:00.047
They have no networks.

08:00.049 --> 08:02.187
So that leaves Dudin,
Zidane, and Kota.

08:02.188 --> 08:06.254
Hmm. A Russian bomber, British
militant, and an African nationalist.

08:06.255 --> 08:07.655
What aren't we seeing?

08:07.656 --> 08:10.156
Ramadi. A truck bomb
killed 133 marines.

08:10.159 --> 08:11.626
And three months ago,

08:11.627 --> 08:13.765
Intel named Dudin,
Zidane, and Kota

08:13.766 --> 08:15.263
as key players in the attack.

08:15.264 --> 08:16.724
And now they're loose in a city

08:16.732 --> 08:18.292
with 34,000 cops,

08:18.300 --> 08:19.600
and none of them can help us

08:19.602 --> 08:21.202
'cause our government
threw these guys

08:21.203 --> 08:23.633
in a hole and deprived them
of their rights.

08:23.639 --> 08:25.509
Hey, I may have a line
on one of the fugitives.

08:25.510 --> 08:27.475
Just intercepted a 911 call

08:27.476 --> 08:29.806
from an apartment in Chelsea
on 31st.

08:29.812 --> 08:31.672
Check this out.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.549
<i>There's someone... a man...
In my apartment.</i>

08:33.551 --> 08:35.049
<i>I can hear him.</i>

08:35.051 --> 08:36.441
<i>Can you describe him?</i>

08:36.452 --> 08:37.611
<i>I don't know. In his 20s,</i>

08:37.620 --> 08:39.320
<i>gray jumpsuit, like a convict.</i>

08:39.321 --> 08:41.581
Hey, our prisoners are wearing
dark jumpsuits.

08:41.590 --> 08:43.328
- We're on our way.
- So are the cops.

08:43.328 --> 08:46.325
I'm looking at their system.
Dispatch was just notified.

08:46.328 --> 08:48.128
Optics, please?

08:48.130 --> 08:49.330
<i>Apartment 502.</i>

08:49.331 --> 08:50.561
<i>Two bedrooms.</i>

08:50.566 --> 08:52.436
Windows on the east-west axis.

08:52.437 --> 08:54.235
<i>Fire escape faces 30th.</i>

09:19.594 --> 09:21.863
<i>Guys, whatever's going on
in there, you need to move.</i>

09:21.864 --> 09:23.834
Police are 90 seconds out.

09:29.137 --> 09:32.373
Hey...

09:32.374 --> 09:33.844
Relax...

09:35.778 --> 09:37.846
Easy. Easy. Okay?

09:37.847 --> 09:40.582
Don't... hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't do anything stupid.

09:40.583 --> 09:41.903
The police are on their way.
Okay?

09:43.352 --> 09:44.552
And I'm right behind you.

09:50.426 --> 09:52.556
Hey, back up. Relax. Relax.

09:54.230 --> 09:56.270
We can help you. Take it easy.

09:56.271 --> 09:57.565
Calm down.

09:57.566 --> 09:59.336
Sixty seconds, boys.

10:07.842 --> 10:09.542
Thirty seconds.
Get out of there.

10:20.388 --> 10:22.228
Okay, we officially
have a problem.

10:23.826 --> 10:26.726
Pollack. NYPD. Open the door.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.696
Open the door.

10:30.699 --> 10:32.499
Coming.

10:41.309 --> 10:42.679
Officers, good afternoon.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.518
We got a call about an intruder.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.673
Intruder.

10:45.681 --> 10:47.511
Yes. Yes, I did make a call.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.586
Yeah, but I thought
I saw something,

10:49.587 --> 10:51.515
and I don't think I did,
and I think I'm okay.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.660
I got the door locked now.
So thank you.

10:53.661 --> 10:55.323
The door wasn't locked.

10:55.324 --> 10:56.524
Was it not?

10:56.525 --> 10:58.955
God, I get a little...
Tired on...

10:58.961 --> 11:00.421
Me and my partner
would feel better

11:00.429 --> 11:01.929
if we could come in
and take a look.

11:01.931 --> 11:03.961
Uh-huh. Okay, great.

11:03.966 --> 11:05.536
You wanna tell me
what he looked like?

11:05.537 --> 11:07.464
Yeah, he's six foot one,

11:07.469 --> 11:12.307
uh, black, uh,
very tall, slender built.

11:12.308 --> 11:15.243
You told dispatch he was wearing
a prison jumpsuit of some kind.

11:15.244 --> 11:16.674
Yeah, you know,
I don't really remember,

11:16.679 --> 11:18.417
but I might...
I think at the station

11:18.418 --> 11:20.944
would probably be better to...
I'd feel better...

11:22.817 --> 11:24.217
What's going on here?

11:24.220 --> 11:26.454
Excuse me. Who are you?

11:26.455 --> 11:27.925
I'm the plumber.
Came back to fix y'all sink.

11:27.926 --> 11:29.623
But why the police here?

11:29.625 --> 11:32.955
I... so... this is the man
I saw in my apartment.

11:32.962 --> 11:35.392
Wait. You called the police 'cause you
saw a black man in your apartment?

11:35.397 --> 11:37.597
Hey. Whoa. That is not accurate.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.535
Go ahead. Lock me up
right here, right now.

11:40.536 --> 11:43.236
What's the maximum sentence
for fixing a racist man's sink?

11:43.239 --> 11:44.439
Oh, come on. I'm not a racist.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.573
I'm not a racist.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.304
All right. Take it easy!

11:47.309 --> 11:50.448
Called over here... Is it
racist to want my sink fixed?

11:50.449 --> 11:51.815
It's racist to...
Come on, man...

11:51.816 --> 11:54.384
Of course you're racist.
I am not a racist.

11:54.385 --> 11:56.413
Take it easy.
How you gonna call the police...

11:56.418 --> 11:58.256
I've seen your artwork.
You ain't got no black artists.

11:58.257 --> 11:59.854
Have a good night, fellas.
I have great taste.

11:59.855 --> 12:02.255
Oh, taste? Oh, so a white
artist got good taste.

12:02.258 --> 12:04.298
I like all the colors of the
rainbow... black, red, blue...

12:04.299 --> 12:06.293
Okay, what's Tupac middle name?

12:13.001 --> 12:14.361
We should deal with that.

12:16.477 --> 12:18.307
<i>Manhattan remains on lockdown,</i>

12:18.313 --> 12:20.948
<i>with a heavy police presence
throughout the city.</i>

12:20.949 --> 12:23.449
<i>Officials are tight-lipped about
why the lockdown was ordered.</i>

12:23.452 --> 12:25.119
The good news is,

12:25.120 --> 12:27.290
three of the five prisoners
are back in custody.

12:27.291 --> 12:29.989
Bad news is,
whoever organized the breakout

12:29.992 --> 12:31.022
is still at large.

12:31.026 --> 12:32.016
How can you know that?

12:32.027 --> 12:33.427
Breakout was meticulous.

12:33.428 --> 12:35.188
Those involved would be given
food and shelter.

12:35.197 --> 12:37.427
They wouldn't be caught
breaking into an apartment

12:37.432 --> 12:38.932
looking for tracksuits.

12:38.934 --> 12:40.234
Where are we on the driver?

12:40.235 --> 12:42.075
Still nothing to connect him
to the prisoners.

12:42.076 --> 12:44.240
Look again.
Cross-reference everything

12:44.241 --> 12:45.499
against Mayhew and Rourke.

12:45.507 --> 12:47.037
Mother's maiden name,
distant relatives,

12:47.042 --> 12:48.472
distant step-relatives.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.557
Start at the beginning.
There has to be a connection.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.363
Were you followed?

13:03.364 --> 13:04.988
No.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.393
How many cabs did you take?

13:06.395 --> 13:08.062
She knows.

13:08.063 --> 13:09.703
The private investigator
you hired to find me...

13:09.704 --> 13:12.198
She... she got to him.
He's working for her now.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.270
Stay focused on Whitehall.

13:15.970 --> 13:18.300
Whitehall.

13:18.307 --> 13:20.167
Has she said anything
about Whitehall?

13:20.175 --> 13:22.977
She found the family
who adopted me.

13:22.978 --> 13:26.578
I figured out how they're
communicating... the code...

13:26.581 --> 13:28.611
But I can't find any mention
of Whitehall.

13:28.617 --> 13:30.517
Are you listening to me?

13:30.519 --> 13:33.449
She's going to meet
my adoptive parents.

13:33.455 --> 13:35.295
They'll tell her I survived,
show her pictures.

13:35.296 --> 13:37.060
I was with them until I was 14.

13:37.061 --> 13:38.389
She's going to recognize me.

13:38.393 --> 13:40.193
Brian Mayhew.

13:40.195 --> 13:42.135
He's the one who orchestrated
the breakout.

13:42.136 --> 13:43.230
What?

13:43.231 --> 13:46.231
Who orchestrated the breakout.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.404
How could you know that?

13:47.405 --> 13:48.702
That black site...

13:59.747 --> 14:01.577
Hey, where you been?

14:01.583 --> 14:03.083
Working a source.

14:03.085 --> 14:05.085
He says Mayhew
organized the breakout.

14:05.087 --> 14:06.517
Well, he's well informed.

14:06.521 --> 14:08.551
We found an offshore transaction

14:08.557 --> 14:10.117
linking the truck driver
to Mayhew.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.495
He was paid to drive
through that wall.

14:11.496 --> 14:13.563
Mayhew is behind
the whole thing.

14:13.564 --> 14:15.332
The source... who is he?

14:16.630 --> 14:18.630
Someone who insists
on anonymity.

14:18.633 --> 14:20.568
Hope you can respect that.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.099
Of course.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.674
Solomon, I got a job for you.

14:28.677 --> 14:31.677
No. Forget the breakout.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.480
This is more important.

14:41.323 --> 14:43.457
Mayhew. You scared me.

14:43.458 --> 14:44.688
Everything on track?

14:44.693 --> 14:48.233
Uh, just... uh, see for yourself.

14:52.333 --> 14:53.501
Is that him?

14:53.502 --> 14:55.069
Yeah, that's him.

14:55.070 --> 14:56.400
Time to get to work.

15:03.578 --> 15:06.078
<i>Authorities now say
the citywide lockdown</i>

15:06.081 --> 15:08.451
<i>is due to a possible
terrorist threat.</i>

15:08.452 --> 15:10.620
<i>No details yet
on the nature of this threat</i>

15:10.621 --> 15:12.379
<i>or when the lockdown
might be lifted.</i>

15:14.488 --> 15:16.788
Four notorious
terrorists escape,

15:16.792 --> 15:20.130
and you're asking me to believe
Brian Mayhew is the reason why?

15:20.131 --> 15:21.758
Whoever located that black site

15:21.763 --> 15:23.533
accessed government
intelligence to do it.

15:23.534 --> 15:24.698
That's Mayhew's specialty.

15:24.699 --> 15:25.799
That's why you had him in there.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.801
He founded hacktivism united.

15:27.803 --> 15:31.472
Angry millennials intent on
exposing corporate corruption.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.643
What's the latest?

15:32.644 --> 15:34.171
Still at his hotel.

15:34.176 --> 15:36.306
Meeting's in less
than three hours.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.141
Okay. And we're still on?

15:38.146 --> 15:39.576
<i>It started innocently enough.</i>

15:39.581 --> 15:41.551
Shutting down
meat processing plants

15:41.552 --> 15:43.250
to protest animal cruelty.

15:43.251 --> 15:44.681
<i>Uh... leaking embassy cables.</i>

15:44.686 --> 15:47.446
Good luck, Brian.

15:47.456 --> 15:50.216
<i>Leaking was one thing,
but Mayhew didn't stop there.</i>

15:50.225 --> 15:53.561
He infiltrated
a top secret NSA mainframe,

15:53.562 --> 15:55.332
stole identities of operatives,

15:55.333 --> 15:58.499
the schematics of the c-34 ICBM.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.330
Okay, assuming you're right,

16:00.335 --> 16:01.735
what's Mayhew going to do next?

16:03.304 --> 16:04.804
He could be just looking
for his freedom,

16:04.806 --> 16:06.836
but something tells me
he's got bigger plans.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.442
<i>The other inmates
still at large?</i>

16:08.443 --> 16:09.812
<i>We're tracking them,</i>

16:09.813 --> 16:11.211
<i>but Mayhew's our priority.</i>

16:11.213 --> 16:12.582
<i>We're running down every lead.</i>

16:12.583 --> 16:14.511
I may know an angry millennial

16:14.516 --> 16:15.706
who used to run
in those circles.

16:15.717 --> 16:17.717
And we're only
learning this now?

16:17.719 --> 16:18.879
We don't talk much.

16:18.887 --> 16:20.517
Haven't gotten along in years.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.422
How long have you known him?
Forever.

16:22.424 --> 16:24.358
Scumbag's my brother.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.559
<i>And he might have Intel
on Mayhew.</i>

16:32.901 --> 16:34.631
- Yes?
- Guest services.

16:34.636 --> 16:35.726
I was told you're having trouble

16:35.737 --> 16:36.837
getting Internet access.

16:40.808 --> 16:43.338
That was fast. It just went
out a few minutes ago.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.312
You're pretty good at this stuff.
Please, don't...

16:47.315 --> 16:48.555
What are you doing?

17:00.728 --> 17:03.158
<i>His source claims
the threat level</i>

17:03.165 --> 17:04.602
<i>has been raised in Manhattan.</i>

17:04.603 --> 17:06.299
<i>The official says the city
is working</i>

17:06.300 --> 17:08.800
<i>to assess the credibility
of the threat...</i>

17:10.438 --> 17:12.768
You look like crap.
Radicalism doesn't suit you.

17:12.773 --> 17:15.512
I'd invite you to stay for lunch,
but clearly you've already eaten.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.609
I wouldn't have come if it wasn't
important. I have business.

17:17.612 --> 17:19.952
My big brother,
the corporate shill,

17:19.953 --> 17:23.317
marionette who just loves
to dance for the man,

17:23.318 --> 17:25.278
wants to talk business with me.

17:25.287 --> 17:27.847
The man is the government.
Halcyon's a private company.

17:27.856 --> 17:30.816
The man is whoever's holding
the almighty dollar.

17:30.825 --> 17:31.925
Hacktivist united.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.794
Used to code with those guys?

17:34.796 --> 17:36.356
And you used to be
mom's favorite.

17:36.364 --> 17:37.434
Things change.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.533
Mayhew broke out of prison.

17:40.535 --> 17:42.403
I need your help finding him.

17:42.404 --> 17:43.944
He's planning something major.
People could get hurt.

17:43.945 --> 17:45.199
People do get hurt.

17:45.207 --> 17:46.507
By the police state.

17:46.508 --> 17:47.538
Mayhew fights big brother.

17:47.542 --> 17:48.812
Naturally, I side with him.

17:48.813 --> 17:50.340
Sorry, bro.

17:50.345 --> 17:52.285
No gold star from your boss
on this one.

17:52.286 --> 17:53.710
Can't help you.

17:53.715 --> 17:56.255
You know, your dad was right.
You're useless.

18:01.522 --> 18:02.690
How'd it go?

18:02.691 --> 18:05.421
He won't help.

18:05.427 --> 18:06.757
Not willingly.

18:06.761 --> 18:07.928
What's that?

18:07.929 --> 18:08.989
It's my spin
on the pen recorder.

18:08.997 --> 18:10.527
Torrent downloaded from RARBG

18:10.532 --> 18:11.702
Tells you what number's
being dialed

18:11.703 --> 18:13.367
from any targeted phone.

18:13.368 --> 18:15.268
I told my brother
we're looking for Mayhew.

18:15.270 --> 18:16.640
And if I'm right,
he's going to call

18:16.641 --> 18:17.968
to send up a warning flag.

18:17.973 --> 18:19.611
Once we have Mayhew's number,

18:19.612 --> 18:21.538
it's a short walk
to getting his address.

18:21.543 --> 18:24.443
He'd betray you like that?
Your own brother?

18:26.414 --> 18:27.982
Come on, Flynn.

18:27.983 --> 18:29.783
Outsmart me one more time.

18:38.026 --> 18:39.556
You sure that's Mayhew's number?

18:39.561 --> 18:41.328
Oh, yeah.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.699
My little brother's nothing
if not predictable.

18:45.266 --> 18:47.426
Brian Mayhew, on the ground.

18:48.869 --> 18:50.999
We're clear!

18:52.973 --> 18:54.543
Somebody's been here recently.

18:54.544 --> 18:56.012
All right. Set up outside.

18:56.013 --> 18:58.311
Make sure we grab
anyone coming in.

18:59.647 --> 19:01.007
Check out this setup.

19:01.016 --> 19:04.046
He's got multiple cameras up
on a hotel room.

19:04.052 --> 19:06.352
Hang on. It's not just one room.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.754
He's tapped into the surveillance
feeds for the entire hotel.

19:08.757 --> 19:10.617
Hey, that's the Warwick on 39th.

19:10.625 --> 19:11.795
What's that file?

19:13.994 --> 19:16.034
I don't know.
Mayhew was recording something.

19:17.665 --> 19:20.475
Or someone.
He's Mayhew's target.

19:26.007 --> 19:27.667
Warwick hotel. Can I help you?

19:27.676 --> 19:30.076
Room 1521. It's an emergency.

19:30.078 --> 19:32.638
Yes, we know. Mr. Adler's already
on his way to the hospital.

19:32.647 --> 19:35.677
Uh, which hospital? Is he okay?

19:35.684 --> 19:39.053
Bellevue. Apparently, he had
some sort of cardiac event.

19:39.054 --> 19:40.823
Is this a family member, or...

19:40.824 --> 19:43.362
Target's name is Adler,
but we might be too late.

19:47.973 --> 19:49.703
Mrs. Adler? 
- Yes?

19:49.709 --> 19:51.739
Detectives Woodbridge and McKay.

19:51.744 --> 19:53.574
If it's okay, we'd like to
ask you a few questions

19:53.579 --> 19:54.979
about your husband.

19:54.981 --> 19:56.721
We have reason to believe
he was attacked.

19:56.722 --> 19:58.346
Attacked?

19:58.351 --> 20:01.551
No. I found him unconscious
in our hotel room.

20:01.554 --> 20:03.814
He had a medical emergency.
We don't think so.

20:03.823 --> 20:06.753
We believe that he was targeted.

20:06.759 --> 20:08.629
Have you seen this man before?

20:08.630 --> 20:12.328
No. My god, is this because
of the key ceremony?

20:12.332 --> 20:13.469
The what ceremony?

20:13.470 --> 20:15.396
My husband is one of the seven.

20:15.401 --> 20:17.939
He holds one of the keys
to the Internet.

20:17.940 --> 20:20.067
The secret keys.
That's why we came here.

20:20.073 --> 20:23.633
Max was supposed to be part of
the root key signing ceremony.

20:23.643 --> 20:25.373
And now he's not?

20:25.378 --> 20:28.108
No. The association has already
arranged for a replacement.

20:28.114 --> 20:29.674
Well, I'm going to go
out on a limb

20:29.682 --> 20:31.052
and say that's not
a coincidence.

20:31.053 --> 20:32.850
Exactly...

20:32.852 --> 20:33.921
What part of the Internet

20:33.922 --> 20:35.460
do these secret keys control?

20:35.461 --> 20:36.985
All of it.

20:38.824 --> 20:40.754
Seven keys control the Internet?

20:40.760 --> 20:42.394
That can't be possible.

20:42.395 --> 20:43.555
No, they don't control
what's on it,

20:43.563 --> 20:44.923
just how to secure it.

20:44.931 --> 20:47.571
All domain names have
an assigned number.

20:47.572 --> 20:50.435
But who assigns the numbers?
Key holders.

20:50.436 --> 20:53.736
Seven security experts
randomly selected by ICANN...

20:53.740 --> 20:56.580
The Internet corporation
for assigned names and numbers.

20:56.581 --> 20:59.676
Max Adler's wife talked
about a key ceremony.

20:59.679 --> 21:01.479
Yeah. Four times a year,

21:01.481 --> 21:04.051
the key holders meet
to generate a master key

21:04.052 --> 21:05.619
and to assign new numbers

21:05.620 --> 21:07.118
to make life difficult
for hackers

21:07.120 --> 21:09.858
who want to direct folks
to malicious sites,

21:09.859 --> 21:11.956
or steal their credit card
information.

21:11.958 --> 21:14.128
But by being
at the key ceremony,

21:14.129 --> 21:16.096
Mayhew gets around
those precautions?

21:16.097 --> 21:17.695
Oh, he does more than that.

21:17.697 --> 21:19.797
He can route any domain name
to him.

21:19.799 --> 21:21.899
You make a wire transfer,
he could get it.

21:21.901 --> 21:23.639
A diplomat sends
a secure cable...

21:23.640 --> 21:24.966
Could go directly to him.

21:24.971 --> 21:26.471
So he's a hacker
who's figured out a way

21:26.472 --> 21:27.972
around having to hack anything.

21:27.974 --> 21:29.604
You said the new master key

21:29.609 --> 21:30.979
is only generated
at this special ceremony.

21:30.980 --> 21:32.444
When's the next one?

21:32.445 --> 21:33.745
Today.

21:33.746 --> 21:36.114
That's why Max Adler
was in town.

21:36.115 --> 21:37.745
It's this afternoon
on west 50th street.

21:37.750 --> 21:39.684
Nez, Tom, get there now.

21:39.685 --> 21:42.454
This ceremony...
Walk me through how it works.

21:42.455 --> 21:44.555
They pull out all the stops...

21:44.557 --> 21:48.057
Pin codes, smart cards,
biometric hand scans.

21:48.060 --> 21:50.960
That is not an easy room
to get yourself into.

21:50.963 --> 21:52.893
Steps are divided up
amongst a bunch of people

21:52.899 --> 21:56.168
to prevent anyone from
compromising the process.

21:56.169 --> 21:58.669
And the whole thing's recorded
for public transparency

21:58.671 --> 22:02.674
to a live stream
on their website. Yahtzee.

22:02.675 --> 22:04.435
How do we get through to them?
We can't.

22:04.444 --> 22:05.904
They're in a Faraday cage.

22:05.912 --> 22:08.882
No electronic devices allowed.
No signals go through.

22:08.883 --> 22:10.749
Something we're not seeing.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.490
Mayhew found a way in that room.

22:12.491 --> 22:14.715
Maybe he used Adler's ID.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.590
He still can't beat
the biometric scans.

22:16.591 --> 22:18.789
Everyone at that ceremony's
supposed to be there.

22:18.791 --> 22:21.591
First off, I'd like to thank
alternate Jeremy Wallace

22:21.594 --> 22:22.794
for making himself available

22:22.795 --> 22:24.955
after Max Adler fell ill
this morning.

22:24.964 --> 22:25.994
Yes.

22:25.998 --> 22:27.598
Wallace, the alternate.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.468
He's got to be the connection
to Mayhew.

22:29.469 --> 22:31.599
We're going to stop this before
that master key gets cut.

22:31.604 --> 22:33.164
Tom and Nez are 60 seconds out.

22:38.109 --> 22:40.209
We're on site. Unfriendlies?

22:40.213 --> 22:41.543
The two guards at the front desk

22:41.547 --> 22:42.677
probably won't like you much.

22:42.682 --> 22:44.782
How do you want to play it?

22:44.784 --> 22:47.514
Okay, let's proceed.

22:54.861 --> 22:57.231
For what it's worth,
we're the good guys.

22:57.232 --> 22:59.130
I wish I had time to explain.

23:07.539 --> 23:10.239
No. Be smart. Be smart.

23:10.243 --> 23:12.943
Okay? Get over there.

23:12.945 --> 23:14.945
Get down! Get down!
Get on your knees!

23:14.947 --> 23:16.114
Face the cage.

23:16.115 --> 23:18.915
Give me the key.

23:23.655 --> 23:25.085
What the hell was that?

23:25.091 --> 23:27.526
Uh, just turn around!

23:27.527 --> 23:29.097
Turn around?

23:31.129 --> 23:33.169
Dumont, can you override the
building's security controls?

23:33.170 --> 23:35.634
Power's down.
It's their emergency protocol.

23:35.635 --> 23:37.035
<i>Someone must've tripped it
on the inside.</i>

23:37.036 --> 23:38.136
Do you have eyes on Mayhew?

23:38.137 --> 23:39.167
<i>Not yet.</i>

23:51.983 --> 23:53.213
That key's worthless.

23:53.219 --> 23:54.689
They'll change it
once you leave here.

23:54.690 --> 23:56.087
Who said I was leaving?

24:11.703 --> 24:13.933
Brian, we need to go, now.

24:13.940 --> 24:15.010
There's nowhere to go.

24:19.077 --> 24:20.877
Drop it!

24:20.880 --> 24:22.814
Put it down.

24:22.815 --> 24:25.884
Brian Mayhew?
There's no way out.

24:25.885 --> 24:28.015
Jeremy, put your weapon down. You
haven't done anything wrong.

24:28.020 --> 24:30.220
The mission...
This is the mission.

24:30.222 --> 24:32.192
It doesn't involve you
getting killed for me.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.930
Brian, don't do anything
you're going to regret.

24:35.931 --> 24:37.628
The only thing I regret

24:37.630 --> 24:38.968
is the time I spent wasting away

24:38.969 --> 24:40.295
in that hole in the ground.

24:43.768 --> 24:44.998
Slow.

24:48.173 --> 24:50.073
Whatever's on this
must be pretty important

24:50.076 --> 24:52.876
for you to risk another lifetime
in that hole in the ground.

24:52.878 --> 24:54.878
I'm innocent.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.950
The domain names...
Which ones did he access?

24:56.951 --> 25:01.186
Only one... acssecuredb.Org.

25:01.187 --> 25:03.387
That's our unlisted url.

25:03.389 --> 25:04.919
Yours? What would he want with...

25:04.924 --> 25:08.124
The NSA backs up their
databases to our servers.

25:08.127 --> 25:10.757
Mayhew was trying to steal
the NSA backup.

25:16.368 --> 25:17.938
<i>Officials say the threat...</i>

25:17.939 --> 25:19.937
The last escaped prisoner
was just found

25:19.939 --> 25:22.039
trying to stow away
on a Staten island ferry.

25:22.041 --> 25:24.209
With Mayhew... that's five.

25:24.210 --> 25:27.178
Call homeland,
give them the all clear.

25:27.179 --> 25:29.879
And have my car pulled around.

25:29.882 --> 25:33.652
<i>We will update you when we
have further information.</i>

25:38.390 --> 25:42.394
I, uh... I assume you think
my seeing Trevor is...

25:42.395 --> 25:46.064
I don't think anything.
I just don't understand it.

25:46.065 --> 25:49.265
I mean, you're Scottie Hargrave.

25:49.268 --> 25:52.404
Exactly. I'm a powerful
corporate executive

25:52.405 --> 25:54.865
looking for a man
who isn't intimidated by me.

25:54.874 --> 25:57.934
You'd be amazed how few men
that describes.

25:57.943 --> 25:59.443
Of course I know Trevor
isn't real.

25:59.445 --> 26:01.745
I'm sure that's not even
his real name.

26:01.747 --> 26:03.677
But he's hot,

26:03.683 --> 26:05.443
he listens well,

26:05.451 --> 26:08.420
and he's easy to talk to.

26:08.421 --> 26:10.461
I, uh... I wanted to talk
to him tonight,

26:10.462 --> 26:12.316
but he's busy.

26:12.324 --> 26:14.924
Can it wait until tomorrow?

26:18.263 --> 26:20.793
I think I found Christopher.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.134
What?

26:23.135 --> 26:25.265
That's incredible.

26:25.271 --> 26:28.111
Well, I'm not sure, and I'm
trying not to get my hopes up.

26:28.112 --> 26:30.375
Right. But if it's true, then...

26:30.376 --> 26:32.806
But if it's true,
I'm going to scream

26:32.812 --> 26:34.812
and laugh and cry

26:34.814 --> 26:37.244
and dance in fountains
and howl at the moon

26:37.249 --> 26:38.749
and celebrate.

26:38.751 --> 26:41.321
I mean, preferably
with a man who loves me.

26:41.322 --> 26:43.154
But in the absence of that,

26:43.155 --> 26:45.015
Trevor would be great.

26:45.024 --> 26:47.184
So, yes, it can wait
till tomorrow.

26:47.193 --> 26:49.793
I just wish it didn't have to.

26:52.464 --> 26:55.164
Mrs. Phelps,
I'm Scottie Hargrave.

26:55.167 --> 26:56.737
I'm here to talk about my son.

26:56.738 --> 26:58.496
I understand you adopted him.

27:04.388 --> 27:08.248
You're making a mistake.
I told you I'm innocent.

27:08.259 --> 27:10.319
Funny how it's always the guys
in handcuffs saying that.

27:10.328 --> 27:12.758
I read your bio.
You stole U.S. missile plans

27:12.764 --> 27:14.694
and tried to sell them to Iran.

27:14.699 --> 27:18.499
Brian's a patriot, right? He
would never betray his country.

27:18.503 --> 27:22.673
When the NSA abuses its power
and spies on innocent Americans,

27:22.674 --> 27:23.843
Brian holds them accountable.

27:23.844 --> 27:25.542
That's why I was
in a black site.

27:25.543 --> 27:28.412
I downloaded data from
an NSA surveillance program

27:28.413 --> 27:30.113
to see if they were
targeting Americans.

27:30.115 --> 27:31.545
I got the missile plans
by mistake.

27:31.549 --> 27:33.609
By the time I realized
what I had,

27:33.618 --> 27:34.878
it was too late.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.256
Our job is not to clear
your name.

27:36.257 --> 27:37.523
It's to bring you in.

27:37.524 --> 27:39.352
I'm not even supposed
to exist anymore.

27:39.357 --> 27:41.597
Do you really think they're
going to let you bring me in?

27:43.862 --> 27:45.262
What is this?

27:47.499 --> 27:48.659
Nez, get us out of here.

27:56.540 --> 27:57.900
I got eight long guns
on this side.

27:57.909 --> 27:59.339
I got three coming this way.

28:03.347 --> 28:04.587
All right, all right... get out!

28:04.588 --> 28:06.212
Easy. Easy. Get out!

28:06.217 --> 28:07.384
Okay! Easy!

28:07.385 --> 28:09.385
Get out! Get out! Okay.

28:09.387 --> 28:11.557
Hey, that Intel you hacked...
I'm here to get it back.

28:11.558 --> 28:12.856
Who do you work for?

28:12.857 --> 28:14.457
We were contracted
to bring him in.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.519
I get the intel,
or everyone gets a bullet.

28:19.263 --> 28:21.363
Pick.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.766
Brian, run!

28:26.837 --> 28:28.707
Jeremy!

28:35.712 --> 28:36.912
Move! Move!

28:43.387 --> 28:47.957
You have to understand what a surprise
this is after all these years.

28:47.959 --> 28:50.719
Believe me,
it's a surprise for me too.

28:50.728 --> 28:53.288
See, I didn't put Christopher
up for adoption.

28:53.298 --> 28:54.728
"Christopher."

28:54.732 --> 28:57.501
Uh, I'm sorry. Jacob.
I know that's his name.

28:57.502 --> 28:58.869
Ms. Hargrave, uh,

28:58.870 --> 29:00.500
I don't want to be rude,

29:00.505 --> 29:02.845
but we were told that
when we adopted Jacob...

29:02.846 --> 29:04.840
That his mother was an addict

29:04.842 --> 29:06.610
who abandoned him.

29:06.611 --> 29:08.611
And I believe
that's a made-up story.

29:10.314 --> 29:11.884
I understand
how this might sound,

29:11.885 --> 29:13.413
and that it comes
out of the blue,

29:13.418 --> 29:17.318
and that you have no
reason to believe me,

29:17.322 --> 29:20.352
but I, uh... I've had
a private investigator

29:20.358 --> 29:21.818
searching for my son.

29:21.826 --> 29:23.295
This is the report he gave me.

29:23.296 --> 29:24.964
I brought it
so you can see for yourself

29:24.965 --> 29:26.893
there's very little chance

29:26.898 --> 29:28.758
that the boy you raised
is not my son.

29:36.340 --> 29:37.640
He has your eyes.

29:38.976 --> 29:40.016
He does?

29:41.345 --> 29:42.415
I see it now.

29:47.684 --> 29:49.322
Would you like to see a photo?

29:49.323 --> 29:51.450
Oh, yes, please.
That would be great.

29:59.796 --> 30:02.966
Uh, I'm sorry, but...

30:02.967 --> 30:04.401
This, the mark...

30:04.402 --> 30:05.902
How did he get that?

30:05.903 --> 30:08.573
It's a birthmark.
He was born with it.

30:10.507 --> 30:13.577
It's been a long time.
You probably don't remember.

30:13.578 --> 30:17.538
Oh, no. No, I remember
everything about my son, and...

30:20.017 --> 30:21.917
This boy is...

30:21.919 --> 30:23.679
It's not him.

30:30.727 --> 30:32.434
Give me a three-block perimeter.

30:32.435 --> 30:34.990
They're gonna stay away
from any CCTV cameras.

30:41.071 --> 30:43.001
Who the hell are these guys?

30:43.007 --> 30:45.947
I told you. The same people who
made me disappear the first time.

30:45.948 --> 30:49.343
Now they want to finish the job.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.647
You gotta tell me right now.
What's on this?

30:50.648 --> 30:52.708
Well, you read my file.

30:52.717 --> 30:55.457
About how I sent an e-mail to a contact
in the Iranian defense organization

30:55.458 --> 30:57.453
from an Internet café
here in New York.

30:57.455 --> 31:00.355
Attached were the design specs for
the c-34 long-range missile system.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.458
That you supposedly never sent.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.060
I didn't.
I was in the café that day.

31:04.062 --> 31:05.929
But I was there every day.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.990
I think the NSA placed someone
there to clone my location

31:07.999 --> 31:09.659
and IP address and set me up.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.736
That flash drive has their
surveillance backups on it.

31:12.737 --> 31:15.607
If I can go through
the café Intel for that day,

31:15.608 --> 31:17.376
I can find proof
of who else was there.

31:17.377 --> 31:20.613
What makes you think the NSA has
info on everyone in that café?

31:20.614 --> 31:21.971
Because that's what they do.

31:21.979 --> 31:25.409
The NSA sucks up data
from everywhere.

31:25.416 --> 31:26.885
Going through that flash drive

31:26.886 --> 31:28.784
is the only chance that I have.

31:31.455 --> 31:33.055
I got two rounds.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.460
I got three.

31:38.463 --> 31:39.993
We need to call in for backup.

31:39.997 --> 31:41.535
No, they have ears everywhere.

31:41.536 --> 31:42.699
You make that call,

31:42.700 --> 31:44.100
they will know exactly
where we are.

31:46.002 --> 31:47.672
That's a chance we gotta take.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.013
Dumont, we need an extraction.

31:53.014 --> 31:55.810
Warehouse, southeast corner,
Vernon boulevard.

31:55.813 --> 31:57.143
You just signed
our death warrants.

31:57.148 --> 31:58.778
They'll be on us any second.

31:58.783 --> 32:00.653
I'm counting on it.

32:08.024 --> 32:09.724
Don't fire unless you have to.

32:09.727 --> 32:13.096
And if you do, don't miss.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.735
Send all assets to the
warehouse on Vernon.

32:15.736 --> 32:16.933
Breach on my command.

32:18.869 --> 32:20.829
<i>Okay, move in.</i>

32:22.105 --> 32:24.145
<i>Follow his cell signal.</i>

32:26.910 --> 32:29.840
This one's clear. Clear.

32:32.449 --> 32:34.849
Hunter's point station
is four blocks away.

32:34.852 --> 32:36.152
We'll never make it that far,

32:36.154 --> 32:37.654
not if they're watching.

32:37.655 --> 32:39.195
Stay put. I'll find us a car.

32:41.591 --> 32:43.861
Cleared them off the street.
Clever.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.440
Clear on this side.

33:00.110 --> 33:01.970
Where is she?

33:01.979 --> 33:06.109
We can't wait, not here. We
gotta keep moving. Come on.

33:06.117 --> 33:09.227
Should be up ahead. Stay sharp.

33:11.788 --> 33:13.848
The phone... it's a diversion.

33:20.797 --> 33:21.967
Drop your weapon.

33:34.177 --> 33:35.747
Guys, you gotta move.

33:40.082 --> 33:44.182
This is all the footage from December 13th
inside the Internet café Cyber Villa.

33:44.187 --> 33:46.117
The NSA was all over Mayhew.

33:46.122 --> 33:48.152
They were siphoning images
from everyone in the place;

33:48.157 --> 33:49.957
phones, laptops, iPads.

33:49.959 --> 33:51.119
And these were collected

33:51.127 --> 33:52.587
around the time Mayhew's accused

33:52.595 --> 33:55.165
of e-mailing Iran specs
to the c-34 missile system?

33:56.465 --> 33:57.532
Stop.

33:57.533 --> 33:58.533
Back it up.

34:00.036 --> 34:02.096
Right there, in the corner.

34:02.105 --> 34:03.572
Now hit "play."

34:03.573 --> 34:06.041
Zoom in.

34:06.042 --> 34:07.409
You recognize him?

34:07.410 --> 34:09.110
It's the guy I just shot.

34:09.112 --> 34:11.242
He must've sent the e-mail
to Iran.

34:12.347 --> 34:14.347
Mayhew was telling the truth.

34:14.350 --> 34:16.050
The government framed him.

34:16.052 --> 34:19.222
Someone framed Mayhew,
but it wasn't the government.

34:20.355 --> 34:22.094
You got Mayhew?

34:23.091 --> 34:24.661
Recognize anybody, Jack?

34:27.129 --> 34:28.297
Should I?

34:28.297 --> 34:30.128
Fourteen months ago,
our firms liaised

34:30.132 --> 34:32.271
on a protection detail
in Riyadh.

34:32.272 --> 34:35.467
The point man of your company
was named Zachary O'Neill,

34:35.471 --> 34:37.670
the same man in that photo.

34:37.674 --> 34:39.974
Odd that he stopped
for a cappuccino

34:39.976 --> 34:43.406
right in the middle of one of the worst
acts of espionage in U.S. history.

34:43.413 --> 34:47.213
Do you have any idea how many
employees work for my company?

34:47.216 --> 34:49.116
I don't keep tabs
on all their whereabouts.

34:49.118 --> 34:51.418
You knew why Mayhew went
to that key ceremony.

34:51.420 --> 34:53.221
You knew what he was looking
for... proof of his innocence.

34:53.222 --> 34:55.621
And when you found out
that he accessed your url,

34:55.625 --> 34:58.635
you sent your hit squad
after us to get him back.

34:58.636 --> 35:01.558
Brian Mayhew's a criminal.

35:01.564 --> 35:03.164
Actually, he's a hero.

35:03.166 --> 35:04.526
One who you framed

35:04.534 --> 35:06.003
in order to set off a firestorm

35:06.004 --> 35:08.032
in the U.S.
intelligence community.

35:08.037 --> 35:12.067
Leaving them no choice but to hand a
billion-dollar cybersecurity contract

35:12.075 --> 35:14.275
to your company.

35:14.277 --> 35:16.207
How much did you make
on that deal?

35:16.212 --> 35:18.680
What price did
your honor go for?

35:18.681 --> 35:21.211
I don't have to stand here
and take this.

35:21.217 --> 35:22.577
You have no proof.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.090
Zachary, stand down.

35:33.096 --> 35:34.156
Stand down.

35:34.163 --> 35:36.298
Well, he can't stand down,

35:36.299 --> 35:38.669
because he's dead.

35:47.275 --> 35:49.685
So, what, you think
I'm going to apologize now?

35:49.686 --> 35:51.679
Hmm? For what?

35:51.681 --> 35:53.150
I'm the real patriot here.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.609
Mayhew was no patriot.

35:54.617 --> 35:56.577
Let me tell you something.
The next war

35:56.586 --> 35:58.276
won't be fought with bullets

35:58.287 --> 35:59.287
or on a battlefield.

35:59.288 --> 36:00.548
It'll be a cyber war.

36:00.556 --> 36:03.456
And our power grids
and our weapons systems

36:03.459 --> 36:05.127
and our nuclear reactors

36:05.128 --> 36:07.088
were all vulnerable
to cyber attack.

36:07.096 --> 36:09.496
But no one took
the threat seriously.

36:09.499 --> 36:13.599
Well, sacrificing Mayhew
woke everybody up.

36:13.603 --> 36:16.603
And if that security contract is my
reward for keeping this country safer,

36:16.606 --> 36:18.036
then so be it.

36:19.374 --> 36:21.243
You're going to prison, Jack.

36:21.244 --> 36:24.182
Give him Mayhew's old cell
at the black site.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.080
I hear it's the prime spot
for traitors.

36:32.355 --> 36:36.391
Brian Mayhew, you're free to go.

36:36.392 --> 36:39.292
If the Intel you hacked got out,

36:39.295 --> 36:41.235
would national security
be compromised?

36:41.236 --> 36:43.460
No, but the spy state would be.

36:43.466 --> 36:45.166
Good.

36:47.803 --> 36:49.137
Thank you.

36:49.138 --> 36:50.668
For everything.

37:07.189 --> 37:11.359
<i>Authorities have reopened
the Lincoln and Holland tunnels</i>

37:11.360 --> 37:15.800
<i>and all major Bridges... this after
DHS determined that rumors...</i>

37:15.801 --> 37:18.598
Please tell me you found him.

37:18.601 --> 37:22.501
<i>NYPD officials say they will remain
vigilant over the coming days,</i>

37:22.505 --> 37:24.575
<i>and continue
to work closely with the...</i>

37:24.576 --> 37:28.810
No? I am so sorry.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.481
Is there anything I can do?

37:30.482 --> 37:32.610
Do you want to talk about it?

37:32.615 --> 37:34.850
Trevor had a cancellation.

37:34.851 --> 37:38.651
He's better than therapy.

37:38.654 --> 37:40.754
<i>He also stressed
the importance of people</i>

37:40.756 --> 37:44.756
<i>continuing to go about
their daily lives.</i>

37:44.760 --> 37:47.529
I knew I shouldn't
get my hopes up,

37:47.530 --> 37:51.500
but I swore I'd never put
myself in that position again.

37:51.501 --> 37:53.468
But...

37:53.469 --> 37:57.199
A boy found so close
to where we lost him.

37:57.206 --> 37:59.606
It just...

37:59.609 --> 38:01.369
I'm a very practical person.

38:01.377 --> 38:03.207
I know bad things happen
to good people,

38:03.212 --> 38:05.482
and I don't believe
in miracles...

38:07.916 --> 38:10.246
But I...

38:10.253 --> 38:13.723
I thought for a moment
that I might find him.

38:58.967 --> 39:00.497
What'd you find?

39:00.503 --> 39:02.573
That Tom Keen's
being extra careful.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.402
<i>You lost him. Not yet.</i>

39:04.407 --> 39:05.667
But whatever he's up to,

39:05.675 --> 39:07.215
he doesn't want anybody to know.

40:06.735 --> 40:09.771
I don't understand.
He works for you?

40:09.772 --> 40:11.772
Always has, always will.

40:13.408 --> 40:15.738
Howard's told me
a lot about you.

40:15.745 --> 40:18.852
You're the one who told Scottie how
to contact my adoptive parents.

40:18.853 --> 40:21.948
Which is why Scottie now
believes that her son is dead.

40:21.951 --> 40:25.851
Which is what the people that we
hired to play Mr. and Mrs. Phelps

40:25.855 --> 40:26.921
led her to believe.

40:26.922 --> 40:27.922
For the moment.

40:27.923 --> 40:29.323
Scottie's resourceful.

40:29.325 --> 40:31.295
She'll figure out
the truth in time.

40:31.296 --> 40:34.494
I just hope she's confided
in you about Whitehall by then.

40:34.497 --> 40:36.697
Whitehall. You said that before.

40:36.699 --> 40:39.299
She's been exchanging
coded messages with someone.

40:39.302 --> 40:41.432
So far, I haven't been able
to decrypt them,

40:41.437 --> 40:42.767
but they should shed
some light on...

40:42.772 --> 40:45.807
On what? What is Whitehall?

40:45.808 --> 40:48.408
A line item.

40:48.411 --> 40:51.611
I noticed it in the halcyon
budget a few years ago.

40:51.614 --> 40:53.984
A warehouse in a remote part
of South Africa

40:53.985 --> 40:57.419
assigned to a covert project
with that name.

40:57.420 --> 40:58.620
I never heard of it,

40:58.621 --> 41:01.089
which means that
whatever it was,

41:01.090 --> 41:03.658
it wasn't
an official company op.

41:03.659 --> 41:05.529
A black op in
your own organization?

41:07.662 --> 41:10.701
I asked a few questions.
I sent a team to check it out.

41:10.702 --> 41:12.830
By the time they got there,
the warehouse was clean.

41:12.835 --> 41:14.335
They knew we were coming.

41:14.337 --> 41:15.837
So I investigated further.

41:15.838 --> 41:18.598
I hired a former
intelligence agent...

41:18.607 --> 41:21.367
One of the best...
To find out the truth.

41:21.377 --> 41:23.637
Two weeks later, he calls me,
middle of the night.

41:23.646 --> 41:28.006
He says we have to talk. He never
shows, and I never see him again.

41:28.017 --> 41:30.047
I believe Scottie
ordered him disappeared.

41:30.052 --> 41:31.822
How do you know it was her?

41:33.488 --> 41:34.748
We have our reasons.

41:34.757 --> 41:36.657
For starters,
that's when she began

41:36.659 --> 41:38.419
her campaign to marginalize me.

41:38.427 --> 41:39.927
Push me out of my own company.

41:39.929 --> 41:41.689
Convince the board
that I was unstable

41:41.697 --> 41:43.997
and had to be sidelined.

41:43.999 --> 41:47.999
And when that didn't work,
she tried to have me killed.

41:48.003 --> 41:50.043
All to keep me
from learning the truth

41:50.044 --> 41:51.969
about Whitehall.

41:51.974 --> 41:54.374
And you think
she's going to tell me?

41:55.910 --> 41:57.479
Why would she do that?

41:57.480 --> 41:59.547
She will.

41:59.548 --> 42:01.708
When she trusts you enough,
she will.

42:03.118 --> 42:05.487
And when she does,

42:05.488 --> 42:08.958
we're going to blow the lid off
whatever it is she's hiding.
