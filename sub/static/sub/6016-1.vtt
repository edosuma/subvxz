00:02.176 --> 00:03.836
It's amazing to me
that people move...

00:05.413 --> 00:07.643
...thousands of miles away
to another city.

00:07.814 --> 00:10.079
They think nothing of it.
They get on a plane.

00:10.251 --> 00:12.412
They live there now.

00:12.587 --> 00:14.578
Just a thousand miles...
I'm living over there.

00:14.756 --> 00:17.691
You know, pioneers... It took years
to cross the country.

00:17.859 --> 00:21.852
Now people will move thousands
of miles just for one season.

00:22.030 --> 00:24.055
I don't think any pioneers did that.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.530
"Yeah, it took us a decade
to get there...

00:26.701 --> 00:28.328
...and we stayed for the summer.

00:28.503 --> 00:31.233
It was nice. It had a pool.
The kids loved it.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.898
And then we left about 10 years ago,
and we just got back.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.067
We had a great summer.
It took us 20 years...

00:37.245 --> 00:39.236
...and now our lives are over."

00:44.519 --> 00:46.817
- Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
- Yeah.

00:46.988 --> 00:48.455
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

00:49.390 --> 00:51.290
Murphy Brown, the TV show?

00:51.459 --> 00:53.552
Come on, will you?

00:53.728 --> 00:58.722
Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
That son of a gun.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.198
- It's something, isn't it?
- With Candice Bergen.

01:01.369 --> 01:03.803
- I know.
- I've always liked her.

01:03.972 --> 01:05.438
Remember her
in Carnal Knowledge?

01:05.607 --> 01:08.132
- Sure.
- She show her breasts in that?

01:08.710 --> 01:10.940
She's not really the naked type.

01:11.346 --> 01:13.109
I can't believe I missed Kramer.

01:13.514 --> 01:15.209
He asked me to go with him.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.881
- He did?
- Yeah. I turned him down.

01:18.052 --> 01:20.885
- How come you didn't tell me?
- He asked me to keep it a secret.

01:21.055 --> 01:22.784
- You can never keep a secret.
- I know.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.983
This was like a record. My previous
record was when Jodi Hirsch...

01:26.160 --> 01:28.458
...asked me not to tell anybody
we slept together.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.030
I kept a lid on that
for about 28 seconds.

01:31.499 --> 01:34.161
- Well, you've come a long way.
- I've matured.

01:34.335 --> 01:36.200
The Tonight Show
called and they want me...

01:36.371 --> 01:39.534
...to do the show on the 28th.
They're giving me free tickets to L.A.

01:39.707 --> 01:41.436
You wanna go?

01:41.609 --> 01:43.076
A free ticket?

01:43.478 --> 01:45.673
Yeah. In fact, we could
track down Kramer.

01:45.847 --> 01:48.680
I always felt bad about the way
he left. That was a mess.

01:48.850 --> 01:51.375
I never should've taken back
those keys.

01:51.586 --> 01:54.146
- What about accommodations?
- All taken care of.

01:54.522 --> 01:56.888
Is there a meal allowance?

01:57.058 --> 01:58.889
What about seat assignments?

01:59.060 --> 02:01.756
Could I have the kosher meal?
I hear the kosher meal is good.

02:01.929 --> 02:05.023
And I need clothes.
I gotta get a haircut.

02:05.366 --> 02:07.766
And I have to refill
my allergy medication.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.835
Do I need a hat?
I need a hat, don't I?

02:11.172 --> 02:14.266
Could we do the Universal tour?
They have that Backdraft exhibit.

02:14.442 --> 02:15.966
Now, that looks very cool to me.

02:16.144 --> 02:20.604
See, my acting technique...
My personal acting technique...

02:20.982 --> 02:24.145
...is working with color.
Imagining color...

02:24.352 --> 02:27.048
...and then finding the emotional,
vibrational mood...

02:27.221 --> 02:28.745
...connected to the color.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.951
If you look through my scripts
you'll see that my lines...

02:32.126 --> 02:35.653
...have a special color.
So I don't memorize the language.

02:35.830 --> 02:40.164
I memorize color. This way, I can
go through red, yellow, green, blue.

02:40.334 --> 02:43.497
And you have a full palette
of emotions.

02:43.671 --> 02:45.104
Hey.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.705
Didn't I tell you to get out of here?

02:47.975 --> 02:49.203
- Did you?
- Let's go.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.311
- I was just...
- Yeah, you were just nothing.

02:51.479 --> 02:53.140
Come on, let's go.

02:53.414 --> 02:55.006
We'll talk about this
a little later.

02:55.183 --> 02:57.549
- Let's go.
- Are you an actor?

02:58.853 --> 03:00.753
See you, Mike!

03:20.775 --> 03:23.801
- Murphy Brown.
- Yeah, Candice Bergen, please.

03:23.978 --> 03:25.775
Who's calling, please?

03:25.947 --> 03:28.313
Well, just tell her that it's Kramer.

03:29.817 --> 03:32.843
All right, I'll... I'll call her at home.

03:34.522 --> 03:36.990
Here. Go ahead. It's all yours.

03:37.759 --> 03:41.388
- Hello, Kramer.
- Oh, Helene. How are you?

03:41.863 --> 03:45.230
I haven't worked since 1934.
How do you think I am?

03:45.399 --> 03:47.458
Well, that's only...

03:47.969 --> 03:51.063
- Fifty-eight years.
- It was a Three Stooges short.

03:51.239 --> 03:52.467
"Sappy Pappies."

03:52.640 --> 03:54.972
I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary,
remember?

03:55.143 --> 03:57.202
Right, yeah.
That was a Shemp, right?

03:57.378 --> 03:59.539
No, no. Curly.

03:59.714 --> 04:02.148
The boys played three sailors
who find a baby.

04:02.316 --> 04:04.978
The baby's been kidnapped,
and the police think they did it.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.318
- Right.
- Of course, they didn't do it.

04:07.488 --> 04:09.718
The police have made
an awful mistake.

04:09.891 --> 04:12.018
Moe hits Curly with an ax.

04:12.193 --> 04:14.821
- The Stooges catch the kidnappers.
- Right.

04:14.996 --> 04:16.930
- But it's too late.
- Really?

04:17.098 --> 04:19.793
- The baby's dead.
- Really?

04:19.966 --> 04:23.232
The boys are sent to death row
and are executed.

04:23.404 --> 04:25.304
Well, I don't remember that part.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.304
I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.909
Oh, yeah, yeah. You were very good.

04:30.077 --> 04:33.240
It was sad for a Three Stooges,
what with the dead baby...

04:33.414 --> 04:35.905
...and the Stooges
being executed and all.

04:36.083 --> 04:39.177
Yeah, well, that was an unusual
choice for the Stooges.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.851
Would you like to buy me a fat-free
frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?

04:43.024 --> 04:45.219
Well, you know, I can't right now,
you know.

04:45.393 --> 04:46.621
I got a very big meeting.

04:46.794 --> 04:49.092
I got these people interested
in my movie treatment.

04:49.263 --> 04:51.595
So we'll have to make it
another time, all right?

04:51.766 --> 04:54.462
No, no! No, no, don't go up there,
Kramer. They'll hurt you.

04:54.635 --> 04:57.570
You'll never make it in this town.
You're too sensitive, like me.

04:57.738 --> 05:00.605
Helene, you're wrong.
You know, I'm not that sensitive.

05:00.975 --> 05:04.741
I was engaged to Mickey Rooney.
He left me at the altar.

05:05.179 --> 05:06.806
Kramer.

05:06.981 --> 05:09.347
Kramer!

05:16.724 --> 05:18.851
- What is this?
- What?

05:19.026 --> 05:22.018
We're going on a two-day trip.
What are you, Diana Ross?

05:23.397 --> 05:26.855
I happen to dress based on mood.

05:28.102 --> 05:30.832
But you essentially wear
the same thing all the time.

05:31.005 --> 05:33.371
Seemingly. Seemingly.

05:33.641 --> 05:37.133
But within that basic framework,
there are many subtle variations...

05:37.311 --> 05:39.745
...only discernible
to an acute observer...

05:39.914 --> 05:42.439
...that reflect the many moods,
the many shades...

05:42.617 --> 05:44.915
...the many sides
of George Costanza.

05:45.086 --> 05:48.419
- What mood is this?
- This is "morning mist."

05:53.227 --> 05:55.695
What do you figure? Twenty?

05:55.863 --> 05:58.388
- Twenty-one?
- Close enough.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.557
Forensics ought to be able
to nail it down.

06:00.835 --> 06:02.564
- No ID?
- No ID.

06:02.737 --> 06:06.264
- No witnesses?
- Just the trees, Johnny.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.499
Just the trees.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.938
Pretty young thing.

06:11.612 --> 06:13.102
She was.

06:13.281 --> 06:14.839
Not anymore.

06:15.349 --> 06:17.214
Somebody saw to that.

06:17.385 --> 06:19.353
Sure did, Johnny.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.881
Damn shame too.

06:22.290 --> 06:23.780
What do you make of it?

06:23.958 --> 06:25.550
I don't know.

06:27.028 --> 06:28.928
But I don't like it.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.699
Look at this guy.
He's like a cat burglar.

06:36.871 --> 06:40.773
He thinks if he goes through real slow,
the machine won't detect him.

06:40.975 --> 06:43.842
I've always been nervous
about going through these things.

06:44.011 --> 06:46.275
I'm afraid I'm gonna step
into another dimension.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.347
Just go.

06:51.152 --> 06:52.517
I made it.

06:52.687 --> 06:55.121
Empty your pockets, please.

06:55.523 --> 06:58.117
Walk through again, please.

06:58.359 --> 07:00.190
Are you sure you don't
have metal on you?

07:00.361 --> 07:03.819
- Bracelets, rings, anklets?
- Anklets? No.

07:03.998 --> 07:05.590
- A lot of men wear anklets.
- Really?

07:05.766 --> 07:08.257
- Yeah.
- What do you have in your bag, sir?

07:08.536 --> 07:10.026
- My bag?
- Step over here, please.

07:10.204 --> 07:12.900
- Over here?
- Do you have a knife in the bag?

07:13.207 --> 07:14.970
A knife?

07:15.309 --> 07:17.436
Open the bag, please.

07:20.948 --> 07:22.813
- What's this?
- Moisturizer.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.114
For your wife?

07:25.319 --> 07:27.344
No. I...

07:27.621 --> 07:29.350
I use it.

07:30.057 --> 07:32.457
Spread your arms and legs, please.

07:35.463 --> 07:39.422
Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.397
Have a good trip.

07:43.204 --> 07:44.432
- All right.
- That's it?

07:44.605 --> 07:45.833
- That's it.
- All right.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.531
Come on, Jerry, let's go.

07:48.576 --> 07:51.670
- What was that all about?
- I must have iron-rich blood.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.677
- Here we go. L.A.
- The coast.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.110
La-la land.

07:55.282 --> 07:57.273
- I got the window seat, right?
- Who said that?

07:57.451 --> 07:59.316
- I called it.
- Oh, no.

07:59.487 --> 08:03.082
It seems to me that the closest thing
we have to royalty in America...

08:03.257 --> 08:05.657
...are the people that get
to ride in those carts...

08:05.860 --> 08:07.293
...through the airport.

08:07.461 --> 08:09.895
Don't you hate these things?
They come out of nowhere.

08:10.064 --> 08:13.556
Beep-beep. "Cart people.
Look out. Cart people. Look out."

08:13.734 --> 08:16.202
We all scurry out of the way
like worthless peasants.

08:17.271 --> 08:19.296
"It's cart people.

08:19.473 --> 08:21.600
I hope we didn't slow you down.

08:21.776 --> 08:26.076
Wave to the cart people, Timmy.
They're the best people in the world."

08:26.514 --> 08:28.846
You know, if you're too fat,
slow and disoriented...

08:29.016 --> 08:32.952
...to get to your gate on time,
you're not ready for air travel.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.714
I hate the people that get
onto the moving walkway...

08:35.890 --> 08:37.982
...and then just stand there.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.183
Like it's a ride.

08:40.361 --> 08:44.229
"Excuse me, there's no animated
pirates or bears along the way here.

08:44.398 --> 08:47.697
Do your legs work at all?"

09:05.753 --> 09:07.243
Yeah, I'm here for the audition.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.015
Which audition? The music video,
the horror movie...

09:10.191 --> 09:11.988
...the exercise tape,
or the infomercial?

09:14.829 --> 09:17.992
Let's see. Well...

09:54.435 --> 09:56.460
You scream good.

09:57.171 --> 09:58.763
You too.

10:04.245 --> 10:07.806
- So can I keep this treatment?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I got 20 copies.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.473
Because I can show it
to my manager.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.313
He has connections with
West German television money.

10:13.487 --> 10:16.684
Yeah, they're trying to put together
a miniseries for me on Eva Braun.

10:16.857 --> 10:18.848
I mean, think about it.
Is that a great idea?

10:19.026 --> 10:22.518
We know nothing about Eva Braun,
only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.

10:22.696 --> 10:24.994
What was it like having sex
with Adolf Hitler?

10:25.166 --> 10:26.656
What do you wear in a bunker?

10:26.834 --> 10:29.064
What did her parents think of Hitler
as a potential son-in-law?

10:29.236 --> 10:31.227
- I could go on and on...
- Wait, wait, hold on.

10:31.772 --> 10:34.070
Look who's over there.
Don't look, don't look.

10:34.241 --> 10:36.072
It's Fred Savage.

10:36.710 --> 10:39.304
- Big deal.
- He'd be perfect for my movie.

10:40.381 --> 10:42.576
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

10:44.718 --> 10:48.677
I gotta go over there. I gotta give him
a copy of my treatment.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.483
Why are you breathing so hard?

10:50.658 --> 10:52.751
I'm just a little nervous.

10:52.927 --> 10:55.327
Okay, I gotta relax.

10:56.564 --> 10:59.727
All right. Wish me luck, huh?

11:05.773 --> 11:07.604
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you?

11:07.775 --> 11:10.039
I'm not crazy. I look weird,
but I'm just like you.

11:10.211 --> 11:13.112
I'm just a regular guy trying
to make it in this business.

11:13.514 --> 11:15.539
You know, I really like your work.
The...

11:15.983 --> 11:17.678
- Thank you.
- I can't remember the name.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.080
- My mind's a blank. I'm nervous.
- That's okay.

11:20.254 --> 11:21.551
- You know...
- Just relax.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.952
Okay, yeah. But I got...

11:24.458 --> 11:26.790
Stupid table.
I'm not normally like this.

11:26.961 --> 11:29.521
Usually I'm cool and charming.
I don't mean to bother you.

11:29.697 --> 11:32.461
It's fate that you happened
to be here at the same time as me.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.595
It's fate. You can't avoid your fate.

11:34.768 --> 11:36.827
I got this treatment
I think you'd be great in.

11:37.004 --> 11:39.131
- I'll give it to you.
- Yeah, okay. Thank you.

11:39.306 --> 11:41.240
Excuse me.
Oh, wait. Are you going now?

11:41.408 --> 11:42.807
- Bye.
- Wait, wait.

11:47.615 --> 11:51.449
Yeah, that's Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R.

11:52.620 --> 11:55.953
I don't know, wavy. George, how
would you describe Kramer's hair?

11:56.423 --> 11:58.152
- Curly.
- Wavy.

11:58.492 --> 12:00.960
- What did you ask me for?
- Yeah. I'll hold on.

12:01.128 --> 12:03.688
George, did you see a piece
of paper on the nightstand...

12:03.864 --> 12:06.458
...like, crumpled up like a napkin?
- No.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.564
Because I had three jokes on it.
They were perfectly worded...

12:09.737 --> 12:11.705
...just the way I wanted to have it.

12:11.872 --> 12:13.703
I can't find it.

12:13.874 --> 12:15.307
Hello?

12:15.476 --> 12:17.376
Hey, a shoe-buffing machine.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.603
I don't know, 6'3"?
George, how tall is Kramer?

12:20.781 --> 12:23.079
You got your own shampoo,
conditioner...

12:23.250 --> 12:26.811
Body lotion, Jerry, body lotion.

12:26.987 --> 12:30.115
- About 6'3".
- A shower cap.

12:31.325 --> 12:33.293
Come in.

12:36.430 --> 12:38.364
Hello. I have more towels.

12:38.666 --> 12:43.399
Oh, good, good. Come in, come in.
Welcome. I'm George.

12:43.604 --> 12:45.834
- Hello.
- Hi. And this is Jerry...

12:46.006 --> 12:48.600
...over there on the phone.
That's Jerry. And you are...?

12:48.776 --> 12:51.472
- Lupe.
- Lupe. That's very nice.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.079
Listen, are you gonna be
making the bed in the morning?

12:54.348 --> 12:55.940
- Oh, yes.
- Fine, excellent.

12:56.116 --> 12:58.175
Could you do me a favor?

12:58.352 --> 13:01.321
Could you not tuck the blankets in?

13:01.488 --> 13:03.388
Because I can't sleep all tucked in.

13:03.557 --> 13:05.218
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yes.

13:05.392 --> 13:07.553
I like to just be able
to take the blankets...

13:07.728 --> 13:10.253
...and swish them and swirl them.
You know what I mean?

13:10.431 --> 13:14.162
You know, I don't like them
all tucked in. I just don't.

13:14.335 --> 13:18.169
I like to have a lot of room. I like
to have my toes pointed up in the air.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.739
I just like to scrunch up the blankets.

13:20.908 --> 13:23.638
Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.

13:23.811 --> 13:26.109
Exactly. You know
what I'm talking about, right?

13:26.313 --> 13:28.508
Yes. It's too tight.

13:29.450 --> 13:32.385
- Him too?
- You want your blankets tucked in?

13:32.786 --> 13:34.447
- What?
- Want your blankets tucked in?

13:34.621 --> 13:36.714
- What blankets?
- When Lupe makes up the beds.

13:36.890 --> 13:38.915
I don't know. Whatever they do.

13:39.093 --> 13:40.788
I tuck in, yes?

13:40.961 --> 13:42.861
Tuck in. Tuck in.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.625
All right. So that's one tuck
and one no-tuck.

13:46.834 --> 13:48.768
- Okay.
- Yes. One second, sweetheart.

13:49.236 --> 13:51.204
Jerry, it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.

13:51.638 --> 13:54.129
Excuse me. Fine.
You don't want me to tuck...

13:54.308 --> 13:56.333
...put me down for a no-tuck.

13:56.543 --> 13:58.408
It's two no-tucks.

13:58.879 --> 14:02.440
Hang on a second. You know what?
Changed my mind. Make it a tuck.

14:02.950 --> 14:06.408
- You just said you weren't tucking.
- I'm tucking.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.656
Hello? Hello? They hung up on me.

14:10.858 --> 14:12.553
They don't know
where Kramer is anyway.

14:12.726 --> 14:17.493
Alrighty. So that's one tuck
and one no-tuck. You got that?

14:19.099 --> 14:22.364
Excuse me. Did you see a piece
of paper on the nightstand here...

14:22.536 --> 14:24.470
...earlier today,
crumpled up like a napkin?

14:24.638 --> 14:27.937
Oh, yes, yes. I throw away
when we clean the room.

14:28.108 --> 14:30.042
- Oh, okay. Thanks.
- Thank you.

14:30.210 --> 14:32.770
Thank you. All right, Lupe,
bye-bye now.

14:32.946 --> 14:34.436
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

14:34.615 --> 14:36.947
I can't believe she threw that out.

14:37.451 --> 14:41.182
I had the perfect wording of a joke
I was gonna do about the airport.

14:41.355 --> 14:43.016
I was gonna do it
on The Tonight Show.

14:43.190 --> 14:44.248
Now I can't remember it.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.484
What did you want?
You left it on the table.

14:46.660 --> 14:48.753
They're not supposed
to throw everything out.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.456
Hey, hey!
It's not Lupe's fault.

14:52.633 --> 14:54.567
- You shouldn't have left it out.
- All right.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.236
Just get your thing together
and let's get out of here.

14:57.404 --> 15:01.363
All right. Now, what mood am I in?
What mood am l...?

15:01.542 --> 15:03.669
- You shouldn't have tucked.
- I like it tucked.

15:03.844 --> 15:06.369
Nobody tucks anymore.

15:25.532 --> 15:26.999
- Hey, lieutenant?
- Yeah.

15:27.167 --> 15:29.465
This was found on her person.

15:29.636 --> 15:31.501
On her person?

15:32.039 --> 15:35.975
- What kind of expression is that?
- I don't know, sir. Police lingo.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.371
Oh, yeah?

15:38.312 --> 15:39.836
What's your name, son?

15:40.347 --> 15:42.713
- Ross.
- Ross.

15:42.883 --> 15:45.716
- You see that person there, Ross?
- Yes, sir.

15:45.919 --> 15:47.318
She's dead.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.149
- Have you got that?
- Yes, sir.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.551
Good.

15:50.891 --> 15:53.325
Get out before you find yourself
on transit patrol...

15:53.494 --> 15:56.088
...writing tickets to senior citizens
with fake bus passes.

15:56.864 --> 15:58.525
Yes, sir.

16:04.238 --> 16:06.900
I think we just caught a break.

16:10.110 --> 16:12.010
This is very exciting.

16:12.212 --> 16:15.272
You're on The Tonight Show. NBC.
Who else is on the show?

16:15.449 --> 16:17.679
- I don't know.
- You might meet a celebrity.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.751
I can't believe she threw out
my napkin.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.980
What are you worried about?
You know it.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.717
- You're gonna be all right here?
- Yeah. Go about your business.

16:26.894 --> 16:29.920
- I'll just wander around.
- All right. Don't wander too far.

16:30.097 --> 16:31.758
I'll meet you back here
in 15 minutes.

16:31.932 --> 16:34.924
Go, go. Don't worry about me.

16:47.014 --> 16:48.345
Hey.

16:49.283 --> 16:51.148
Corbin Bernsen.

16:51.685 --> 16:53.346
How you doing?

16:55.122 --> 16:59.650
- Big fan. Big fan.
- Thank you.

17:02.162 --> 17:04.790
- Hey, you grew a beard, huh?
- Yeah.

17:04.964 --> 17:08.492
Yeah. Yeah, I'm doing a movie
during my hiatus.

17:08.835 --> 17:10.700
Hey, you know...

17:10.904 --> 17:14.464
Do I have a case for you guys
to do on L.A. Law.

17:15.375 --> 17:16.773
Really.

17:18.444 --> 17:22.279
So mind you, at this point, I'm only
going out with her two, three weeks.

17:22.516 --> 17:26.748
So she goes out of town,
and she asks me to feed her cat.

17:27.753 --> 17:33.886
So, at this time, there's a lot of stuff
going on in my life...

17:34.061 --> 17:38.054
...and it slips my mind
for a few days.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.791
Maybe a week. Not even a week.
Five, six days.

17:40.968 --> 17:42.936
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, what happened?

17:43.103 --> 17:47.062
Well, it's the damnedest thing.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.538
The cat dies.

17:50.944 --> 17:55.040
So she comes back. She finds the cat,
lying on the carpet, stiff as a board.

17:55.215 --> 17:58.013
- So you killed the cat?
- That's what she says.

17:58.185 --> 18:00.619
I say, "Listen...

18:00.787 --> 18:04.655
It was an old cat.
It died of natural causes."

18:04.825 --> 18:09.285
So get this. Now she tells me
that I gotta buy her a brand-new cat.

18:09.830 --> 18:12.765
I say, "Listen, honey,
first of all...

18:13.000 --> 18:16.697
...it was a pretty old cat. I'm not
gonna buy you a brand-new cat...

18:16.870 --> 18:18.735
...to replace an old dying cat.

18:18.905 --> 18:21.169
And second of all,
I go out to the garbage...

18:21.341 --> 18:23.741
...I find you a new cat
in 15 seconds."

18:23.910 --> 18:27.869
I say, "You show me an autopsy report
that says this cat died of starvation...

18:28.048 --> 18:30.312
...I spring for a new cat."

18:30.517 --> 18:33.509
So she says something to me,
like, I don't know...

18:33.687 --> 18:36.918
"Get the hell out of here."
And she breaks up with me.

18:38.058 --> 18:41.494
Now, don't you think that would be
a great case on L.A. Law?

18:45.432 --> 18:47.423
I don't wanna tell you
how to run your show...

18:47.601 --> 18:49.068
No, of course not.

18:49.236 --> 18:51.830
It's enough with the bar already,
you know what I'm saying?

18:52.272 --> 18:54.570
Have they thought
about changing the setting?

18:54.741 --> 18:55.935
Doubt it. I doubt it. Yeah.

18:56.109 --> 18:58.236
Because people do meet in places
besides a bar.

18:58.412 --> 18:59.902
Well, yeah, they do.

19:00.113 --> 19:02.604
What about a rec room, huh?

19:02.783 --> 19:04.250
Or a community center.

19:04.418 --> 19:05.885
You ought to write one of those.

19:06.053 --> 19:08.385
I'll bring it up with the producers.
I gotta...

19:08.555 --> 19:11.786
Fabulous. I'll think about that,
George. Thank you.

19:12.592 --> 19:14.355
- How's it going?
- Great, great.

19:14.528 --> 19:18.089
I actually just had two meaningful,
intelligent conversations...

19:18.265 --> 19:20.130
...with Corbin Bernsen
and George Wendt.

19:20.300 --> 19:23.133
- Really?
- Yeah. Not fan talk. Not gushing.

19:23.303 --> 19:26.602
You know? Actual conversation.
I was incredibly articulate.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.438
You got toilet paper
on your heel there.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.849
It's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

19:38.018 --> 19:41.078
Tonight Jay welcomes
Corbin Bernsen, George Wendt...

19:41.254 --> 19:43.882
...and comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.

19:45.759 --> 19:49.354
Oh, yeah. People are always trying
to give me a great case for L.A. Law.

19:49.529 --> 19:51.963
Just a few seconds ago,
right outside in the hallway...

19:52.132 --> 19:54.930
...this nut, some sick nut
comes up to me...

19:55.102 --> 19:58.765
...and says he was supposed
to watch this girl's cat...

19:58.939 --> 20:02.238
...while she was away out of town.
Anyway, he forgets to feed the cat.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.207
The cat dies, starves to death.
He kills the cat.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.346
Refuses to get her a new one.

20:07.514 --> 20:10.005
Won't give her any money,
won't pay her.

20:10.183 --> 20:12.674
And he wants Arnie Becker
to represent him. Nice guy.

20:12.853 --> 20:14.844
Yeah, that'd make a great case
for L.A. Law.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.984
Thanks a lot.

20:18.625 --> 20:22.789
He's a very handsome man.
Passionate, intense.

20:23.630 --> 20:26.258
But troubled, strange.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.061
I think he may be in love with me.

20:29.236 --> 20:33.297
Of course, there's nothing abnormal
about that. I have many suitors.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.734
It's funny, because
even after all these years...

20:35.909 --> 20:40.141
...we still get people giving us advice
how to improve the show.

20:40.313 --> 20:43.441
Actually, a few moments ago,
I ran into a nut back there...

20:43.617 --> 20:45.983
...who said that maybe
we should think about...

20:46.153 --> 20:48.815
...you know, not doing the show
in a bar.

20:53.560 --> 20:56.961
So that's when I said,
"Hey, Kramer, dude...

20:57.130 --> 20:59.530
...you ever kill a man before?"

20:59.833 --> 21:02.768
And he said,
"What do you think, junior?

21:02.969 --> 21:07.030
These hands have been
soaking in lvory Liquid?"

21:07.207 --> 21:09.198
That guy you talked to,
what did he look like?

21:09.376 --> 21:13.312
- Short little bald guy with glasses.
- That's the same guy I talked to.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.539
Never ends, does it?

21:16.116 --> 21:21.179
So I'm going through the airport,
and I put my bag on that little...

21:21.354 --> 21:24.152
The... The conveyor belt.

21:30.230 --> 21:32.528
Issue an arrest warrant.
Put out an APB.

21:32.699 --> 21:34.826
Let's pick up this...

21:35.101 --> 21:36.659
...Kramer.

21:38.271 --> 21:41.570
- I was terrible.
- What, are you crazy? You were fine.

21:41.741 --> 21:43.902
I couldn't remember
what I was trying to say.

21:44.077 --> 21:46.136
- That whole thing about the...
- Conveyor belt.

21:46.313 --> 21:49.248
Yeah. Because she threw out
my napkin.

21:49.916 --> 21:52.214
I can't believe...
You're blaming Lupe?

21:52.385 --> 21:55.877
Yes. Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.

21:57.123 --> 21:59.114
Our top story tonight:
There's been a break...

21:59.292 --> 22:03.126
...in the so-called Smog Stranglings.
Police have just released a photo...

22:03.296 --> 22:06.322
...of the suspect being sought
in connection with the slaying.

22:06.499 --> 22:10.595
He is known only as Kramer.

22:15.275 --> 22:17.505
Talk show hosts
never seem to have any idea...

22:17.677 --> 22:19.702
...how much time is left in the show.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.178
They're always looking off-camera:
"Do we have time?

22:22.349 --> 22:24.010
How are we doing on time?

22:24.184 --> 22:26.948
Anybody know what the time is?
What's the time?"

22:27.220 --> 22:29.313
You never see Magnum P.I. go,
"Should I strangle this guy...

22:29.489 --> 22:31.514
...or are we gonna take a break here?

22:31.691 --> 22:34.751
Can you stay for another beating?
I'll bop him in the head.

22:34.928 --> 22:38.921
We'll do a commercial, come back,
I'll drive the car real fast. Stay with us."
