WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:03.753
Previously on Justified...

00:04.003 --> 00:06.089
It's a down payment on a house, Ava.

00:06.256 --> 00:07.674
Anywhere you want it.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.759
You and me, we killed a man.

00:10.260 --> 00:13.054
We dumped his body
down a mine shaft without ceremony.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.223
I sunk a man was shot right in front of me,

00:15.307 --> 00:17.308
down a splinter shaft off Black Lick Road.

00:17.434 --> 00:20.478
You think telling this girl what you done,
that cleans your slate?

00:20.604 --> 00:22.105
You kill her, you got to kill me, too.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.981
You willing to have
two murders on your head?

00:24.108 --> 00:26.025
You got no idea what I'm willing to do.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.027
I understand, Ava,

00:28.112 --> 00:30.196
why you needed to do it
the way that you did it.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.240
There's still one more move we can make.

00:32.323 --> 00:35.868
And we get rid of Delroy's body
once and for all.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.662
This is my world.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.664
And my world has a high cost of living.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.457
- How much do you want?
- A hundred.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.084
- Thousand?
- Each.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.045
What has your God told you to do,
Mr Augustine?

00:46.130 --> 00:47.255
Kill Drew Thompson.

00:47.339 --> 00:50.925
Well, if you want Drew Thompson,
you'll need Raylan Givens.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.177
And if you want Raylan Givens,
you'll need me.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.430
Raylan, old friend?

00:55.514 --> 00:57.306
Hold your fire. Drew's not here.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.183
You want to come in, take a look.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.686
Boyd, want to send a message to you

01:01.812 --> 01:04.313
and the boys you're working for from Detroit.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.649
You lost. Give up. Go home.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.317
- Was that the Marshal in the hat?
- It was.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.486
- What was his name?
- Raylan Givens. We got to go.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.823
Congratulations. Nice work.
And you're suspended.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.662
So, Drew Thompson
and Ellen May taken care of?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.205
Drew's on his way to the safe house.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.583
We're gonna put Ellen May
up in a little no-tell motel

01:23.667 --> 01:25.001
till we figure out what to do with her.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.463
- Well, good. And what's this?
- Paperwork's all done.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.173
All is right with the world.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.009
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.679
There's not just one more thing
you need to do before I suspend you?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.389
No, I think I'm good.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.058
That was supposed to be withering sarcasm.

01:41.185 --> 01:43.811
Because I'm thorough?
Because I like to see things through?

01:43.896 --> 01:46.606
I think maybe it's
because you'd rather face a gun thug

01:46.690 --> 01:49.984
- than, say, go to a birthing class.
- Well...

01:50.068 --> 01:53.237
I'm gonna start testing that theory right now.
Got a call from Winona.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.949
Something about two rocking chairs,
and we already had one.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.118
How many rocking chairs
does a woman need?

01:59.203 --> 02:00.536
Apparently, I'm about to find out.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.455
Well, consider yourself suspended.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.373
Much obliged.

02:06.168 --> 02:09.127
- That guy you shot... You good?
- He called it.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.839
Well, if you need someone to talk to...

02:11.924 --> 02:13.424
- You got Rachel.
- I got Rachel.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.760
- No pink.
- I beg your pardon?

02:15.844 --> 02:18.471
Baby's nursery.
You want to stay away from pink.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.223
I'll keep that in mind.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.475
I could have told him that.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.603
That's everything on the list.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.439
- You check the light on your helmet?
- Yeah. Good to go.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.442
How deep we gonna have to get?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.111
Well, it doglegs left about 150...

02:34.238 --> 02:37.323
- Gotta figure that's where we'll find him.
- 150 feet?

02:38.492 --> 02:39.909
What, you afraid of falling?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.911
I'd be more scared of it falling in on you.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.413
Shit, Boyd.
When's the last time this thing was mined?

02:44.498 --> 02:46.374
I'd put it this way.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.793
My daddy's granddaddy
was the last person on the payroll

02:48.919 --> 02:50.378
to walk out of that mine.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.755
Baby. Can I have a word?

02:52.923 --> 02:55.174
- You got this?
- Yeah.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.930
You always said moving a body
was a real good way of getting caught.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.933
Well, that's why it's only an option
when you have no other option.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.352
It's a bird in hand, Ava.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.854
Jimmy? Jimmy, we gotta go.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.021
Lock and load.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.956
- Yeah.
- What do you got?

03:27.082 --> 03:29.750
Located 10-7, in advanced decomp.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.253
Gonna need a coroner's bag, a shovel, and...

03:34.298 --> 03:35.673
A lot of rope.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.475
Boyd?

03:50.772 --> 03:51.981
Stay here.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.777
Mooney.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.280
What's going on?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.949
I think you know what's going on, Boyd.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.994
KSP passed us
a tip about a body in a mine shaft.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.496
Well, there's always rumours
about that sort of thing.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.665
This ain't a rumour.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.173
Well, looks like
I picked the wrong day for a picnic.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.982
What do we do?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.463
Gayle! Winona!

04:58.548 --> 05:00.549
You guys left the...

05:02.719 --> 05:04.470
You must be Raylan.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.724
Raylan.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.895
Let's talk about how to keep this
from being the worst day of your life.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.266
- You know this thing has night vision?
- Makes sense, I mean...

05:50.809 --> 05:52.351
I mean, how else you gonna
watch the kid sleep?

05:52.436 --> 05:53.811
When are you supposed to sleep?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.312
You're sure this is all he had?

05:55.397 --> 05:58.357
'Course I'm sure.
It's not like the first time I frisked a guy.

05:58.442 --> 06:01.402
One gun in his belt?
No... No holster? No backup piece?

06:01.486 --> 06:02.611
No badge, either.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.197
- I've been suspended.
- For doing what?

06:05.449 --> 06:06.782
My job, mostly.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.452
No wonder the Chinese are kicking our ass.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.038
They expect you to stay up all night
glued to this thing,

06:12.122 --> 06:13.831
watch the kid's chest go up and down?

06:13.957 --> 06:16.959
I guess they assume
you'll do anything to keep your kid safe.

06:18.295 --> 06:23.132
Girl's got some balls on her, Raylan.
Threatening us without threatening us.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.967
You know what she said earlier?

06:25.052 --> 06:27.970
If we're gone before you arrive,
we might live through the day.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.806
Well, that's why I love her.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.433
I'm glad to hear you say that,

06:32.517 --> 06:36.145
'cause the thing we need you to do for us
requires a little acting.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.565
Sounds like you won't need to search too
hard for your motivation.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.983
Well, good.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.569
Have you seen The Friends of Eddie Coyle?

06:44.279 --> 06:47.656
The stickup crew in that movie,
the guys that Mitchum buys the guns for...

06:47.741 --> 06:50.326
Moe Greene and
one of the fellas from Rockford Files.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.453
Remember how they'd
bust into a bank manager's house,

06:52.537 --> 06:54.497
leave one man there while the bank manager

06:54.581 --> 06:57.374
drives the rest of the crew to his branch,
lets them into the vault?

06:57.542 --> 06:59.460
Guy hits the alarm, his family dies.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.504
Tries to signal someone, they die.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.840
Everything goes smooth,
guy gets his family back.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.509
They drive off and count their money.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.262
You guys saying we're gonna go rob a bank?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.514
Shelby Parlow.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.099
We're gonna rob Shelby?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.476
Hey. Asshole.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.896
How's he gonna get us into the safe house
if it looks like he's just been worked over?

07:18.980 --> 07:21.023
I'm just supposed to stand here
while he runs his mouth?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.692
Just hit him in the gut next time or the balls.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.780
No. We're not gonna rob anybody.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.574
You're gonna take us
to where you're keeping Shelby.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.953
Get whoever's guarding him
to open the door.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.373
Then we're gonna go in
and do what needs doing.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.084
Cobb will stay here with Ms Hawkins.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.669
Anything goes wrong, he kills her.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.630
Slow.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.925
Maybe tears the baby out, kills it separate.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.305
How'd he blow it with you, anyway?

07:55.142 --> 07:58.435
You'll understand
if I'm not really in a sharing place right now.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.896
Man. Don't tell me he stepped out on you.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.731
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

08:02.816 --> 08:07.278
I'm afraid you're wasting your time.
I can't help you.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.157
All you boys can do now
is make things worse for yourselves.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.868
If I were you, I'd drop my gun,

08:13.952 --> 08:16.453
lay down on my tummy,
and put my hands behind my head.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.039
- You would?
- I would if I were you.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.667
If I were him,
I'd just work on reading that little book

08:21.751 --> 08:23.294
without having to move my lips.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.183
Think it through, now.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.312
Even if you get me,
it won't solve your problem.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.690
You think this beard makes me Santa?
I'm an elf.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.610
You don't get me to Shelby,
all of you, her, the baby...

08:47.694 --> 08:50.237
You're all on Nicky's list, marked for life.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.366
All right.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.554
I don't want to go someplace and start over.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.725
But there's nothing left to do but run.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.730
Baby, you ain't goin' anywhere without me.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.566
I'm not saying I want to.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.402
Truth be told, Ava,
the world being what it is today...

09:33.073 --> 09:36.325
I don't know where we would
go that they wouldn't find us.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.169
Well, it could be I have
one more card to play.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.339
Boyd, they got Delroy's body.

09:51.466 --> 09:54.885
They think they got Delroy's body.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.015
Well, there's no ID's on any of them.
We'll have to wait for prints.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.142
- They ain't my problem any more.
- Clearly.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.311
It's this guy
who sent them I'm concerned about,

10:04.396 --> 10:06.021
this Nicky fella.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.189
Nicky Augustine.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.025
- Good. You're familiar?
- More than I'd like to be.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.568
You want to tell me where I could find him?

10:11.653 --> 10:13.737
Deputy, I'm just here
to make sure the t's get dotted

10:13.822 --> 10:16.031
and nothing happens
to our case against Theo Tonin.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.199
Theo Tonin?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.952
We ain't talkin' about him.
This has got nothing to do with him.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.037
- We know.
- What do we know?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.707
Theo Tonin flew to Tunisia
a couple days ago.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.460
Topless beaches and no extradition.
Fun for him.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.379
Sounds like he's taking an early retirement.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.090
You say that like
it's supposed to make me feel better.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.176
Well, it is. Sammy's his next-in-line,

10:36.261 --> 10:38.721
and apparently,
he and Nicky aren't real fond of each other.

10:38.805 --> 10:39.972
It's all very Shakespearean.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.725
You're saying Sammy is gonna set this right?

10:43.059 --> 10:44.518
Well, either he will or

10:44.602 --> 10:47.479
maybe some of your fellow
federal-law-enforcement officials.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.064
Sammy's a punk.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.401
Sammy's scared of his own shadow
'cause his shadow could kick his ass.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.361
Yeah, Raylan, but he's not this,

10:54.446 --> 10:57.072
and he's not going
to accept Nicky as his number two.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.657
Nicky will eat him alive.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.952
- You don't even know Nicky.
- I know what he is.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.747
And I know what it means
once you're on his list.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.832
You know so much, tell me I'm wrong.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.335
Thank you. You can go now.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.879
- Get a pencil. Do whatever lawyers do.
- I got it.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.213
David, just give us a second here.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.757
Art, don't try to tell me

11:14.841 --> 11:16.884
I can't work this case
because I've been suspended.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.177
- Well, you have been suspended.
- Look around.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.678
But that's not why you can't work this case.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.722
They're wheeling bodies
out of my kid's goddamn nursery.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.140
That's why.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.022
Fine.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.775
And when Nicky makes good on his threat

11:32.859 --> 11:35.652
to kill Winona and the baby,
that's gonna be on you.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.452
Raylan, I can't imagine
what you're going through.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.288
I really can't. And I feel for you.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.874
But just so we're clear...

11:50.710 --> 11:52.378
If you go after Nicky

11:53.588 --> 11:54.880
don't bother coming back.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.644
Everything okay?

12:09.270 --> 12:10.562
No.

12:11.106 --> 12:14.441
- What's wrong? The baby?
- No, the baby's fine. I'm fine.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.735
But everything is not okay.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.615
Can you give us a sec?

12:26.788 --> 12:28.664
He said we're on "the list".

12:28.748 --> 12:30.499
- That was bullshit.
- How do you know?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.085
- He was just trying to scare you.
- Well, it worked.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.253
Listen to me.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.632
Everything... You are gonna be fine.
I promise.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.427
I am having a hard enough time
dealing with this, Raylan,

12:41.511 --> 12:44.346
without you coming in here and lying to me.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.820
We're gonna take you to a hotel.

13:00.572 --> 13:04.074
- Do I get a protection detail or WitSec?
- Protection detail.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.367
'Cause if it was WitSec, then, you know,

13:05.452 --> 13:06.493
we wouldn't have to change the baby's name,

13:06.578 --> 13:07.703
seeing that she doesn't have one yet.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.037
Just a protection team.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.874
Okay. Maybe one
of them can be my birthing coach.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.501
If you need something from inside,
we should get it now.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.878
I want someone to take you right away.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.337
What are you gonna do?

13:18.131 --> 13:20.382
I'm gonna find the guy responsible for this,

13:20.925 --> 13:22.801
and I'm gonna take care of it.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.688
Mr Paxton.

13:34.772 --> 13:39.109
Why, thank you very much for coming out on
what I'm sure is a very busy day and life.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.739
Well, what am I doing here, Boyd?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.365
I don't work for you any more.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.034
No, but you work for him.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.077
And he works for me.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.746
Now, Jimmy, lock that front door.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.875
You trying to scare me again, Mr Crowder?

13:54.959 --> 13:57.002
I think you're already
scared of me, Mr Paxton,

13:57.086 --> 13:58.462
as you very well should be.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.672
Now, I would invite you to take a seat,

14:00.757 --> 14:03.008
but I don't think
this meeting's gonna take very long.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.345
Now, law enforcement
uses your funeral home

14:06.429 --> 14:09.223
as a morgue sometimes, am I correct?

14:09.516 --> 14:13.227
Funeral directors often
provide storage for law enforcement

14:13.603 --> 14:15.729
out of a sense of civic responsibility.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.190
Or payback for them
being in your back pocket.

14:19.192 --> 14:23.362
Well, there's a body
in your morgue right now, Mr Paxton.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.615
State police pulled it
out of a mine shaft this morning.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.784
Now, Mooney, don't you lie to me.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.704
Have the police put a name to that body yet?

14:33.957 --> 14:36.875
State police said it was Delroy Baker,

14:36.960 --> 14:40.295
some fella that used to run Audrey's
before he went missing and you took over.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.215
Let's dispense with the ambiguity, shall we?

14:44.676 --> 14:47.302
Medical Examiner's
coming down from Lexington in the morning

14:47.387 --> 14:50.347
to identify the body and the cause of death.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.059
Well, Mr Paxton...

14:54.477 --> 14:57.854
I need you to help me
make that body in your morgue

14:58.690 --> 15:00.065
not Delroy.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.902
- May I ask why?
- No. You may not.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.239
Simple answer to your question is to steal it.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.284
Get another body to replace it.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.996
- But if you are suggesting...
- I am not suggesting.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.502
Do you have any idea
where to get a second body?

15:21.170 --> 15:24.631
Well, you're the undertaker. You tell me.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.009
Why would I do all this to help you?

15:27.510 --> 15:31.346
To consider your debt to me
paid in full, Mr Paxton.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.109
Man, I don't like this.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.945
- What, you scared?
- Ain't you?

15:47.030 --> 15:49.448
Only thing I'm scared of
is not getting this done in time.

15:49.532 --> 15:50.949
Keep digging.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.338
Well, they didn't even have the decency
to put him six feet down.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.797
All right.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.133
- We gotta get him up out of here.
- Yeah.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.220
Shit, Boyd!

16:13.222 --> 16:14.306
Hey!

16:14.724 --> 16:16.642
Don't you know what we're doing is illegal?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.310
Now shh.

16:18.728 --> 16:19.895
Stay calm.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.647
Get me out of this, Boyd.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.148
Keep... God! Oh!

16:25.193 --> 16:26.818
Hand me that flashlight.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.412
It's a cardboard box.
That's what happens, you die indigent.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.747
What do we do now?

16:38.831 --> 16:42.709
Well, we take a few moments to contemplate
the mortal remains of Henry Willis

16:43.086 --> 16:46.922
and to thank him for being
more useful in death than he ever was in life.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.133
- You knew this guy?
- Ironically, I did.

16:50.802 --> 16:54.221
He started drinking at 10,
got hooked on oxy by the time he was 15.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.056
That is all she wrote.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.767
But we all end up where he is sooner or later.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.519
All right, hold that.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.565
We're never gonna
get him out of here in one piece.

17:05.775 --> 17:09.694
Best we wrap him, take him to go.
Go get that plastic out of the truck.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.363
Hey. Hey.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.240
Give me that flashlight.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.576
Ava! Ava!

17:19.789 --> 17:21.205
How'd it go?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.125
Almost as planned.

17:23.751 --> 17:24.876
The body's in the van?

17:25.252 --> 17:27.212
Look over your right shoulder.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.714
Jesus, Boyd!

17:29.424 --> 17:32.134
Well, I couldn't leave him on the street,
parked in the van.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.803
Now, just pretend he's that uncle
shows up drunk at Thanksgiving,

17:34.887 --> 17:37.723
sits in a chair
watching football all afternoon.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.558
You never even notice he's there.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.394
How long we gotta keep it here?

17:42.478 --> 17:44.479
Just until
Jimmy gets back with that funeral truck.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.064
- Speaking of which, Jimmy...
- Yeah?

17:46.149 --> 17:48.066
Best you head on over to Paxton's.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.402
He said he's going to leave the key
on the front tyre.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.112
Got it.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.908
Baby, you sure this is gonna work?

17:57.910 --> 18:00.996
Well, we're gonna
wait for Jimmy to get back with that truck,

18:01.122 --> 18:03.540
then we're gonna load up this body,
take it over to the funeral home,

18:03.666 --> 18:04.791
and we're gonna make the swap.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.878
Now, Medical Examiners
are coming out first thing in the morning,

18:08.004 --> 18:11.173
and they expect to find Delroy Baker
filled with buckshot,

18:11.299 --> 18:15.010
but what they gonna find
is Henry Willis filled with oxy.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.095
And Ellen May's story falls apart.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.474
Then we're gonna take Delroy
and we're gonna sink him in that slurry pond.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.518
Well, unless you want
to stuff him and mount him over the bar.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.773
Now, I sure could use a drink of whisky,
get that graveyard taste out of my mouth.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.024
Boyd!

18:38.785 --> 18:40.035
Funny.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.371
I honestly thought you'd
have enough sense to run.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.956
Run from what?

18:45.458 --> 18:46.875
What I'm still wondering...

18:47.960 --> 18:50.837
Did he find Winona himself,
or did you give her up?

18:51.547 --> 18:53.048
We're closed, Raylan.

18:53.174 --> 18:56.134
Ava, why don't you go behind the bar
and pretend like you're cleaning up?

18:56.219 --> 18:58.887
It's all right. I don't think we're staying.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.475
Unless your friend Nicky Augustine's
stupid enough to be here, too.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.895
Just 'cause I know a fella,
Raylan, don't make him my friend.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.480
You're gonna want a jacket.

19:08.564 --> 19:13.068
Maybe you're not looking around,
but we got a lot going on at the moment.

19:13.736 --> 19:17.656
You seem to have the impression I'm asking.
That's my fault.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.157
You are coming with me, Boyd.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.493
The only question is,
are you taking me to Nicky

19:21.577 --> 19:23.411
or am I taking you to jail?

19:23.496 --> 19:24.913
Taking me to jail for what?

19:25.039 --> 19:28.750
You really want me to give you a list
of all the things I could hang on you?

19:28.835 --> 19:31.670
Probably skip half of it
and still be here all night.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.923
Well, fine, Raylan. Take me to jail.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.759
You're hesitating 'cause you take me

19:37.885 --> 19:40.512
and you blow
your only shot at getting Nicky Augustine.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.849
Well, I take it I'm your admission ticket?

19:43.933 --> 19:47.936
The hesitation was 'cause I just realised,
I should probably take her, too,

19:48.020 --> 19:51.273
save me from making another trip,
two birds, one stone and all.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.607
Take her where, Raylan?

19:52.733 --> 19:55.026
You know, that Ellen May...

19:55.444 --> 19:58.697
Dumb as a box of rocks,
but she's such a sweet girl,

19:58.781 --> 20:01.783
and you get her talking,
she's just too lazy to shut up.

20:02.869 --> 20:06.246
It's fascinating all the lives people have led.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.460
- That's bullshit.
- Which part?

20:12.545 --> 20:15.380
- You ain't got nothin' on Ava.
- You sure?

20:16.299 --> 20:18.133
You gonna come into my house...

20:19.635 --> 20:21.303
No badge.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.638
No backup.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.392
And threaten to take
my woman away from me?

20:29.312 --> 20:30.812
I figure it's worth a shot.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.648
You think that's the best way
to get me to help you?

20:33.774 --> 20:36.651
No. And I'm sorry, Boyd.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.279
And now that that's done,
you gonna take me to Nicky or not?

20:43.826 --> 20:46.077
I'm gonna take you to Nicky, Raylan.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.498
But not because I believe
you've got anything

20:51.167 --> 20:53.418
on either of us.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.753
Of course.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.756
You're gonna take me
because you're my buddy.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.675
I need to say goodbye to my woman.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.469
You can do it from right there.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.601
Ava, darlin',
I sure am sorry I'm gonna miss that dinner.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.437
It's not gonna be the same without you.

21:13.147 --> 21:15.523
- I'll talk to you afterwards.
- Let's go.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.664
Light switch is to the left.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.711
Damn it.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.713
- Little help!
- Not my job.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.636
- You ever seen an autopsy?
- No.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.555
Doesn't leave much
to the imagination, I can tell you that.

21:47.890 --> 21:48.974
Want to know what this does?

21:49.058 --> 21:50.809
I want to put this down.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.229
Where do they have Delroy?

21:54.689 --> 21:55.897
Icebox.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.033
- Which one's Delroy?
- The one that looks like beef jerky.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.584
That would be him.

22:20.756 --> 22:24.217
- Mooney, can you get us a body bag, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.554
- And, Jimmy, can you cut this plastic off?
- Yep.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.690
It's a pretty good match.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.358
Yeah, let's just get this over with.

22:43.029 --> 22:46.281
So, Crowder calls out of the blue
and says he's bringing the Marshal,

22:46.407 --> 22:48.616
and you just
drop everything to play "high noon".

22:48.701 --> 22:50.952
You want to explain to me
how this makes any sense?

22:51.037 --> 22:52.537
All the shit I've heard about this guy,

22:52.621 --> 22:55.373
there's no way
I'm saying no to a face-to-face.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.083
Plus, maybe he wants to cut a deal.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.127
I doubt that.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.546
Well, we'll know shortly.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.632
You're not even a little worried
he's trying to set us up,

23:04.717 --> 23:07.385
maybe even bust me for
that shit at the high school?

23:07.470 --> 23:09.471
I might be worried
if Crowder wasn't bringing him here.

23:09.555 --> 23:10.638
What? You trust Crowder?

23:10.723 --> 23:13.349
I trust him
not to hand us up to the Feds, yeah.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.729
You know, Sammy's already pissed
we went after the ex-wife.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.856
He wants us to come home now
and kiss his new ring.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.399
You think it's smart to keep him waiting?

23:21.484 --> 23:23.443
Sammy is a rat-faced bitch boy.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.862
He's Theo Tonin's rat-faced bitch boy.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.330
We wouldn't even be
having this conversation

23:35.414 --> 23:37.290
if you'd popped the Marshal in the first place.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.959
- Christ.
- But instead...

23:41.462 --> 23:42.921
You let him back you down.

23:43.589 --> 23:47.092
He didn't back me down. The cops pulled up.

23:47.593 --> 23:51.346
Well, all I know is, if I'd have been there,
he'd never walked out.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.682
And that would have been pointless, Nicky.

23:54.809 --> 23:56.976
It would have just drawn heat, as usual.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.815
You think too much.

24:04.193 --> 24:05.318
Pay the cheque.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.237
I'll be in the car.

24:12.785 --> 24:17.038
Well, this might be a silly question,
Raylan, but do you have a plan?

24:17.373 --> 24:19.541
Sit across from Nicky,
tell him the game's the game,

24:19.667 --> 24:21.459
but you don't go after a man's family.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.003
Well, just so you're aware,

24:24.380 --> 24:26.881
whatever Nicky knows about Winona
did not come from me.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.299
Okay.

24:29.718 --> 24:33.388
Now that you mention it, though,
I'm not sure you're one to talk about

24:33.472 --> 24:36.015
going straight at a man
'stead of what he loves.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.562
You love her, Ava?

24:41.230 --> 24:42.564
You have to ask?

24:42.648 --> 24:44.190
Love her like how...

24:44.650 --> 24:48.736
Like how you loved the Lord
and your lovely white skin

24:49.989 --> 24:52.574
or how you loved Arlo?
I know he meant a lot to you.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.826
You know...

24:54.910 --> 24:56.995
You can know a fellow your whole life

24:57.830 --> 24:59.330
and not really know him at all.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.251
You know what I think, Raylan?

25:03.836 --> 25:06.421
I think you're just jealous
that I've got to open a present

25:06.505 --> 25:09.007
that will never be under your Christmas tree.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.260
I think you love anything

25:12.344 --> 25:16.264
lets you put your head on the pillow at night
believin' you ain't the bad guy.

25:17.933 --> 25:22.604
So, you face off with Nicky, and he says,
"I have no idea what you're talking about.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.856
"Never even knew you had a family."
Then what?

25:26.442 --> 25:28.776
You tell him anything he says
can be used against him?

25:28.903 --> 25:31.696
Nothing gonna be used against him.
This ends tonight.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.948
Well, maybe you get him to pull,

25:34.450 --> 25:37.785
count it down like you did that
old gun thug in Miami.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.455
Figure if it ain't broke...

25:40.539 --> 25:41.873
Well, what if he won't pull?

25:41.957 --> 25:43.208
They always pull.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.918
Well, what if he won't?

25:45.586 --> 25:47.837
Well, I guess you'll just murder him
where he sits.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.091
You know what I'm wondering?

25:52.635 --> 25:56.971
Is, what do you tell yourself at night
when you lay your head down

25:57.514 --> 26:00.975
that allows you to wake up in the morning
pretending that you're not the bad guy?

26:14.990 --> 26:16.449
What are we doing?

26:16.951 --> 26:18.159
Jimmy, this is where you get out.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.703
Ava, Boyd don't want me
to just leave you out here.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.622
It's okay. I'll take care of Boyd.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.790
He told me I shouldn't...

26:23.874 --> 26:25.333
Boyd ain't here.

26:27.836 --> 26:28.962
Get out.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.547
Yes, ma'am.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.308
Well, you might as well give me my gun back.

26:42.393 --> 26:43.851
I'm sure you'll be fine.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.311
Not me I'm worried about.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.231
I'm just offering
to even up your odds a little bit.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.026
I count four to one.

26:52.319 --> 26:53.903
That hardly seems fair.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.239
Which way do you mean?

26:58.409 --> 26:59.701
Thanks for the ride.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.661
Good luck, cowboy.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.840
You guys ever figure out who
was right about the astronaut?

27:14.216 --> 27:15.925
We agreed to disagree.

27:16.844 --> 27:18.344
I need to check you for a wire.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.346
- Won't find one.
- Still need to check.

27:20.431 --> 27:23.516
Long as you understand,
anything else you find, I plan to keep.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.768
Nicky doesn't care you're armed.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.604
Figures I won't try anything
with all this firepower you got here?

27:28.939 --> 27:30.273
Either that or he doesn't give a shit.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.404
You okay with your wagon hitched to a guy
that doesn't give a shit?

27:36.739 --> 27:40.116
Higher up the mountain,
worse the footing gets.

27:40.576 --> 27:43.536
Plane crashes,
first class always hits the hardest.

27:43.871 --> 27:47.373
I learned one thing a long time ago,
doesn't pay to be the lead dog.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.250
You know the best way
to survive a plane crash?

27:49.376 --> 27:51.210
- How's that?
- Don't be in it.

27:52.129 --> 27:55.923
All right? So just keep your panties on,
sit tight, let me take care of it.

27:57.634 --> 27:58.760
Marshal's here.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.265
- Where you headed?
- Why? You need a lift?

28:04.600 --> 28:08.478
- Where'd you think you were headed?
- That sounded kind of ominous.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.104
Getting right to the point?

28:10.230 --> 28:12.482
Sooner we get to it, sooner we get through it.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.525
No point delaying the unpleasantness.

28:14.610 --> 28:17.445
Are we headed for unpleasantness?

28:17.571 --> 28:19.155
The deal I'm gonna offer you,

28:19.656 --> 28:21.407
I ain't optimistic you'll take it.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.827
Well, you know,
negative thinking yields negative results.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.496
Yeah. Well...

28:26.997 --> 28:28.289
It's been a day.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.958
Well, at least give me the chance
to surprise you.

28:31.794 --> 28:33.920
No point in going into a relationship

28:34.380 --> 28:36.798
assuming people
are just gonna disappoint you.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.257
You're right.

28:39.468 --> 28:42.804
I want you to turn yourself in,
confess to murder, racketeering, obstruction,

28:42.930 --> 28:45.056
whatever other horrible things you done.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.182
Is that all?

28:46.308 --> 28:48.559
I want you to swear you'll leave my family be.

28:48.644 --> 28:51.229
- Or?
- Or you'll die here in this limo.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.231
Well, you had it right not to be optimistic.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.982
I'm afraid that's the best I can do.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.652
- You carrying a piece?
- Glock .26.

28:57.778 --> 29:00.321
Yeah? Is that the same one you used
to take out my guys this morning?

29:00.406 --> 29:02.907
No. I pulled a Beretta off the big fella.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.785
- What are you carrying?
- I don't have a gun.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.078
Maybe you should get one.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.621
Why? So you can have a reason?

29:08.997 --> 29:10.998
You already gave me a reason.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.502
Bullshit. Take one look at you,

29:14.628 --> 29:17.672
I know you're not the kind of guy
who'd just execute me. It's not who you are.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.007
Then you come in here
with your bullshit cop threats,

29:20.092 --> 29:22.927
knowing that if your bluff gets called,
you can always hide behind your badge.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.346
I don't have a badge. All I got is my word.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.349
So if I say I'm gonna kill your family,
I'm gonna kill your family.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.476
'Cause these animals out here,

29:30.561 --> 29:33.729
they think they can get over on me,
they'll tear me to pieces.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.357
You want to know where I'm headed?
I'm headed to Detroit,

29:36.567 --> 29:39.527
to kill Theo's pasty little pussy of a son.

29:39.653 --> 29:41.821
But I'll be back for your family.

29:41.905 --> 29:46.409
You had a chance to save them this morning,
but instead, you took out three of my guys.

29:47.995 --> 29:51.497
So the only chance they have now is
if you use that Glock on me to end this.

29:53.667 --> 29:56.878
If you're not gonna do it,
get the hell out of my car.

30:01.091 --> 30:02.550
Well...

30:04.011 --> 30:05.386
Now we know each other.

30:06.263 --> 30:07.388
Cop threats.

30:07.848 --> 30:10.099
Relax. You're still in the limo.

30:15.856 --> 30:17.523
Look, we're just waiting for the plane.

30:17.608 --> 30:21.569
We'll be back in Detroit before breakfast,
and I'll take care of it when I get back there.

30:32.623 --> 30:36.584
- Sammy. Thanks for coming.
- Thank you for reaching out.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.878
You talked to him? What'd he say?

30:38.962 --> 30:40.963
He said he's gonna murder my wife and child.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.508
Yeah, no, I heard. I feel terrible about that.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.301
But I meant, what'd he say about me?

30:46.261 --> 30:48.137
He said you're a pussy,
and he's gonna kill you.

30:52.935 --> 30:55.394
I guess his guys
ain't gonna give you too much trouble.

30:55.479 --> 30:56.604
You want to survive in this business,

30:56.730 --> 30:58.481
you have your money on
the horse that's out front.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.235
What about you?
You gonna give me trouble?

31:02.319 --> 31:03.986
About doing what I have to do?

31:04.321 --> 31:06.489
If Nicky had chosen to turn himself in,

31:06.990 --> 31:08.616
I'd have taken him in.

31:08.951 --> 31:11.953
But he decided to go another way.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.581
So if you saw a crime committed against him,

31:15.666 --> 31:20.586
you wouldn't, as a lawman,
feel the obligation to intervene?

31:22.297 --> 31:23.464
I'm suspended.

31:34.268 --> 31:35.518
Picker.

31:54.997 --> 31:56.163
Ava?

31:57.332 --> 31:58.541
Ava!

32:01.211 --> 32:02.461
Boyd.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.171
Where the hell is Ava?

32:04.673 --> 32:06.173
She wouldn't let me go with her.

32:07.175 --> 32:10.052
I tried, Boyd. I didn't know what to do.
I tried to stay with her!

32:10.178 --> 32:12.179
I swear to God, Boyd, I tried!
She told me to come back!

32:28.739 --> 32:30.031
Jesus.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.169
Oh, shit.

32:48.592 --> 32:49.925
Boyd?

32:51.011 --> 32:52.553
I thought Boyd was with you.

32:53.513 --> 32:54.555
Mooney?

32:55.599 --> 32:56.932
I could use a little help.

32:59.353 --> 33:00.770
What you got there, Ava?

33:05.275 --> 33:06.734
Is that a body?

33:10.614 --> 33:12.615
You sure you want to make this play?

33:13.533 --> 33:17.411
Why don't you turn around
and put your hands behind your head?

33:23.794 --> 33:25.544
Or maybe it's not your play.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.421
Maybe it was Paxton's.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.549
How 'bout you just keep quiet?

33:30.884 --> 33:33.177
We were just driving by
and we saw the lights.

33:33.261 --> 33:36.597
Wasn't me you was after, though, was it?
It was Boyd.

33:36.723 --> 33:37.973
You'll do.

33:51.321 --> 33:52.405
That's it.

33:52.489 --> 33:54.615
This body was stolen
from your funeral home last night?

33:55.951 --> 33:57.660
I'd know that face anywhere.

34:08.505 --> 34:09.672
Mooney?

34:10.297 --> 34:13.300
Just sorry you weren't here
a few hours ago, Boyd.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.319
Lock up this piece of shit.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.112
- No need for that.
- What?

34:34.197 --> 34:37.408
He's assaulted an officer, resisted arrest,
interfering with police business.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.619
Simmer down, Mooney. He's upset.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.706
I don't think he's gonna be any more trouble.

34:44.623 --> 34:46.375
How 'bout it, Mr Crowder?

34:47.377 --> 34:49.503
Are you gonna be any more trouble?

34:50.505 --> 34:53.047
Let this white trash piece of shit go.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.797
I'm gonna get a lawyer,
the best one that money can buy,

35:32.881 --> 35:35.549
and I'm gonna have you
out of here in 24 hours.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.386
We both know that's not gonna happen.

35:40.222 --> 35:43.557
You got more to say?
She'll have visiting hours.

35:43.683 --> 35:44.767
Now get out of here!

36:10.126 --> 36:12.878
- This everything?
- That's everything I need.

36:16.633 --> 36:18.968
You know you and the baby are safe, right?

36:19.928 --> 36:21.929
I know. That's why I love you.

36:25.475 --> 36:27.393
I'm so sorry about all of it.

36:28.812 --> 36:30.104
Yeah, well...

36:30.605 --> 36:32.147
Least nobody died.

36:47.789 --> 36:50.791
- Call me when you land.
- Okay.

36:52.002 --> 36:54.712
- Say "hey" to your mother for me.
- I will.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.773
Where's the master of the house?

37:20.780 --> 37:21.822
Another glass?

37:34.336 --> 37:36.503
Did you hear the news out of Detroit?

37:40.091 --> 37:42.968
Little Sammy is the new head of the outfit.

37:44.346 --> 37:46.847
And I'm their man east of the Mississippi.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.809
Congratulations.

37:54.189 --> 37:57.358
You felt the need to
come all the way down here to tell me that?

38:00.362 --> 38:02.780
All the strife, all the bloodshed...

38:04.699 --> 38:06.367
All the turmoil...

38:06.868 --> 38:09.286
Kings fall, princes rise up.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.456
And here we still are.

38:14.668 --> 38:16.377
The survivors.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.382
The arrangement we discussed before?

38:23.385 --> 38:26.804
I'd like you to handle
my heroin distribution in Kentucky.

38:31.351 --> 38:33.310
Nod if you're interested.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.319
Good.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.531
We're both gonna be very wealthy men.

38:52.664 --> 38:53.998
I'll be in touch.

40:16.623 --> 40:17.748
What's up, Art?

40:17.832 --> 40:19.416
Just wondering if you've heard the big news.

40:19.501 --> 40:20.667
What news?

40:20.752 --> 40:24.421
Looks like Sammy Tonin
is gonna hold on to the crown after all.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.174
Where's that leave Nicky Augustine?

40:27.258 --> 40:29.676
Found dead in the back of a stretch limo.

40:29.761 --> 40:33.806
Can't give you all the details now,
but all the signs point to a mob execution.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.350
Live by the sword, die by the sword, right?

40:37.268 --> 40:39.144
I suppose you're gonna say "I told you so".

40:39.312 --> 40:41.772
Well, I like to think
I'm a bigger person than that,

40:41.856 --> 40:43.440
but I did tell you so.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.652
Well, I appreciate the call, Art.

40:47.821 --> 40:49.655
Just thought you might want to know.

40:50.824 --> 40:52.366
I will sleep well tonight.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.952
All right. See you in 30 days.
