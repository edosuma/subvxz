It's pretty great having Andy
working in the building.

00:06.318 --> 00:07.752
The guy is so much fun.

00:07.877 --> 00:09.102
His new thing...

00:09.227 --> 00:10.527
Piggyback rides.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.254
Anytime you want.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.229
Piggyback! Piggyback!

00:14.473 --> 00:15.473
Move!

00:15.724 --> 00:16.993
Piggyback. Bam!

Councilman Howser.
Hello.

00:32.825 --> 00:34.533
- Hello.
- Did you get my proposal

00:34.858 --> 00:37.787
for the possible re-zoning
of lot 48?

00:38.082 --> 00:39.689
I have been busy.

00:39.874 --> 00:43.325
But I think it would be a really great
thing for the neighborhood.

00:43.450 --> 00:46.212
I don't doubt it, but it's really
a question of resource allocation.

00:46.562 --> 00:48.004
I completely understand that.

00:48.129 --> 00:50.174
But we know
that if we want to find the money,

00:50.342 --> 00:51.175
we can.

00:52.187 --> 00:53.177
I'm running late.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.553
I'll walk with you.

00:54.678 --> 00:57.098
See, the thing is,
when we allocate money for Parks...

<i>Hunting Trip</i>

01:04.700 --> 01:05.720
mpm

01:06.567 --> 01:07.677
lestat78

01:17.664 --> 01:19.837
Just a reminder,
tomorrow's a half day.

01:19.962 --> 01:21.918
Jerry, Mark, and I have to conduct

01:22.499 --> 01:24.417
the annual trail survey

01:24.585 --> 01:26.067
at Slippery Elm Park.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.587
I had the trail survey hats made

01:28.712 --> 01:30.636
to commemorate the trip.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.191
Nice, Jerry.

01:33.079 --> 01:35.176
And if you have
any questions about the details,

01:35.301 --> 01:37.430
feel free to shoot me an email.

01:41.613 --> 01:43.782
The only trails
he's gonna be surveying

01:43.907 --> 01:45.859
are trails of lies and deception.

01:46.090 --> 01:47.940
Ron has a special deal
with the park rangers.

01:48.406 --> 01:50.652
Every November,
they let him use their cabin,

01:50.777 --> 01:53.863
so he can go on a secret hunting trip
with all the guys in the office.

01:54.198 --> 01:56.073
Not all the guys.
He's never taken me.

01:56.334 --> 01:57.734
Fine, all the men.

01:58.455 --> 02:00.020
Ron, let's cut the bull.

02:00.145 --> 02:03.454
I want me, Tom, and all the other ladies
included on your hunting trip.

02:04.361 --> 02:05.511
Hunting trip?

02:05.903 --> 02:08.559
We're doing a trail survey, Leslie.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.920
You're literally listening
to turkey calls.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.420
Is this not rap?

02:13.992 --> 02:15.460
- Come on.
- All right, look.

02:15.585 --> 02:17.750
It's not just a hunting trip.

02:19.342 --> 02:20.723
It's a tradition.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.791
I am really good at hunting.

02:23.016 --> 02:25.561
And I'm even better
at being one of the guys.

02:26.395 --> 02:27.995
It's a work event,

02:29.047 --> 02:31.275
so, legally,
I can't stop you from coming.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.150
This is gonna be so fun!
I'll bring s'mores.

02:34.464 --> 02:35.914
And just like that,

02:37.031 --> 02:39.731
the one tiny aspect of government
I enjoyed

02:40.215 --> 02:42.515
was clubbed to death before my eyes.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.638
April, I need you
to do something for me.

02:45.763 --> 02:47.613
I'm going hunting tomorrow,

02:48.126 --> 02:50.645
so call the State Parks Office
and get verbal confirmation

02:50.770 --> 02:52.463
that our budget documentation is in.

02:53.134 --> 02:54.898
Can I tell you
the 16 tracking number,

02:55.023 --> 02:57.051
or do you want me to write it down?

02:57.423 --> 03:00.168
- Can you handle this?
- You want me to dial a number,

03:00.293 --> 03:02.222
and then read another number
out loud?

03:03.515 --> 03:04.892
Can you handle this?

03:08.557 --> 03:09.857
Well, try. Okay?

03:10.273 --> 03:11.544
And if you do it,

03:11.669 --> 03:13.816
I will name the first turkey I shoot
after you.

03:15.158 --> 03:16.158
Cool.

03:20.529 --> 03:22.304
Ann, ready to bag some birds?

03:22.429 --> 03:24.710
No, but I am ready
to relax by the fire

03:24.835 --> 03:27.085
and get my real simple magazine on.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.438
If you change your mind,
you are now officially

03:29.563 --> 03:31.126
a licensed Indiana hunter.

03:31.854 --> 03:32.854
Gross.

03:38.625 --> 03:41.807
<i>Hello, you have reached
the Indiana State Parks Department.</i>

03:41.932 --> 03:45.061
<i>Your call is very important to us.
Please stay on the line.</i>

03:55.558 --> 03:57.439
- Here we go.
- Here we are.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.029
There's Ron.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.615
It's pretty!
I thought it was gonna be gross.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.352
Holy cow.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.996
It is good to be back!

04:09.456 --> 04:10.606
Sneak attack!

04:12.654 --> 04:14.324
- Damn it!
- I'm the pants king!

04:14.449 --> 04:16.170
- Bow to me.
- Bow. I bow.

04:17.654 --> 04:19.154
I'm the pants queen!

04:20.908 --> 04:22.136
What the hell!

04:23.242 --> 04:24.892
Bow to the pants queen.

04:25.578 --> 04:28.482
When you're out with the boys,
you gotta be ready for a good pantsing.

04:28.719 --> 04:32.319
That's why I have suspenders
that connect my bra to my jeans.

04:33.642 --> 04:35.274
Ron "P. Diddy" combs.

04:35.683 --> 04:38.402
I have to admit,
this place is pretty tight.

04:39.005 --> 04:40.946
May I interest anyone in some chew?

04:41.282 --> 04:42.281
Nice touch.

04:43.327 --> 04:44.740
Let me get some of that.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.410
- You sure?
- Yeah.

04:46.535 --> 04:48.745
I would not have pegged you
as a user of mouth tobacco.

04:49.712 --> 04:51.240
I'm full of surprises, Ron.

04:51.365 --> 04:53.765
Man, my stomach's a little upset.

04:54.096 --> 04:55.461
I feel a little queasy.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.130
That might be the chew.
You could spit it out.

04:58.782 --> 04:59.798
I swallowed it.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.425
You're supposed to swallow it?

05:10.406 --> 05:11.406
All right.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.449
Poor little buddy.

05:14.574 --> 05:16.780
That's why they call it chew
and not swallow.

05:16.905 --> 05:19.234
- Am I right, Ron?
- Yes, you are right.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.779
All right, safety basics.

05:24.281 --> 05:26.700
Tell me why it's bad
to look down the barrel of your gun?

05:27.079 --> 05:28.544
Is that a trick question?

05:28.669 --> 05:30.197
No, Donna, don't!
Please.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.628
Rule number one,
do not point the weapon at a person.

05:33.753 --> 05:35.417
That includes your own face.

05:35.812 --> 05:38.347
Now, every year before we go
on our first hunt,

05:38.472 --> 05:40.472
we do a toast, so grab a beer.

05:44.764 --> 05:45.928
To the hunt.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.021
Hear, hear!

05:47.146 --> 05:48.596
And to the hunters.

05:49.525 --> 05:51.625
The only way to defeat the beast

05:51.913 --> 05:53.813
is to find the beast within.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.313
- Pretty good.
- Hear, hear!

05:56.606 --> 05:57.555
Right on!

05:57.680 --> 05:59.025
Ron, your toast sucked.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.484
The traditional toast

06:00.797 --> 06:02.323
is "to the hunt."

06:02.966 --> 06:04.705
And it is said by me.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.611
You all set, Mark?

06:06.736 --> 06:08.698
Maybe we could do mixed doubles.

06:08.823 --> 06:10.077
Boy/girl, boy/girl.

06:10.386 --> 06:12.663
You said
that we were gonna hunt together.

06:13.130 --> 06:16.416
I always forget because you're so pretty
you're not used to rejection.

06:17.143 --> 06:18.877
I have to hunt with Ron.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.302
- Ann, we'll go together.
- Perfect.

06:21.557 --> 06:25.307
I hope you're ready to discuss
some college bowl game scenarios.

06:26.198 --> 06:27.029
Bully.

06:37.426 --> 06:38.729
Can you come here?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.289
- What's up?
- I've been on hold for an hour.

06:41.414 --> 06:43.360
I really have to pee.
Can you sit here

06:43.570 --> 06:44.827
and just listen?

06:44.952 --> 06:45.988
Please? Great.

06:46.494 --> 06:50.094
And if they answer, can you just read
those numbers out loud?

06:53.627 --> 06:55.497
Now here's the female
adolescent turkey.

06:57.679 --> 07:00.356
Could you hear the difference?
The turkeys can.

07:06.699 --> 07:08.844
We do that the first time
one of us hits something.

07:09.012 --> 07:09.962
Cool.

07:10.087 --> 07:11.680
No. You missed it.

07:13.063 --> 07:14.904
Look, Ron, I know this weekend

07:15.029 --> 07:18.089
you were looking forward
to a lot of man on man on man action,

07:18.214 --> 07:21.927
but I wanted to say I'm very grateful
that you let me come along on this trip.

07:22.052 --> 07:23.152
That's fine.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.641
I'm just glad you didn't end up inviting
more of the motor...

07:27.799 --> 07:28.946
What the***?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.376
- What the hell? Give me some warning.
- I saw a quail.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.663
Sorry, man.
You snooze, you loose.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.838
I think this is gonna be a really good
bonding sesh for me and Ron.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.757
Guys love it when you can show them

07:46.882 --> 07:49.217
you're better than they are
at something they love.

07:50.824 --> 07:52.036
Check this out.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.342
<i>I am on hold</i>

07:54.597 --> 07:56.308
<i>with the State Parks Department</i>

07:57.087 --> 07:58.477
<i>I am on hold</i>

07:58.897 --> 08:00.853
<i>so suck on my butt</i>

08:01.148 --> 08:01.938
Nice.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.757
They didn't answer, obviously.

08:07.882 --> 08:09.013
Where is everyone?

08:09.138 --> 08:10.989
- Hunting trip.
- Hunting trip?

08:11.254 --> 08:12.240
Did Mark go?

08:12.892 --> 08:15.118
That's cool.
At least he's not with Ann.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.128
- No, Ann's there.
- God!

08:17.833 --> 08:20.024
How come he gets to do
all the things I want to do?

08:20.149 --> 08:21.315
Go hunting...

08:21.800 --> 08:22.800
Ann...

08:23.044 --> 08:24.669
Maybe a deer will eat him.

08:28.758 --> 08:29.846
That'd be awesome,

08:29.971 --> 08:32.177
but I don't think
that will happen, probably.

08:32.386 --> 08:35.337
You surprised that my breasts
didn't throw my aim off?

08:35.462 --> 08:36.712
Leslie, please.

08:37.085 --> 08:39.934
I don't care that you're a girl,
I just don't like change.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.188
I like the same place, the same people,
telling the same stories,

08:43.356 --> 08:45.249
and seeing who can bag
the most turkeys.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.652
You like hunting with the same people
because you can beat 'em.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.198
100 bucks says I bag
more birds than you.

08:53.684 --> 08:54.491
You're on.

08:55.087 --> 08:57.561
Let's split up.
I do it better alone.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.432
Yeah, you do. See?

08:59.860 --> 09:01.178
Just one of the guys.

09:03.357 --> 09:05.387
Your favorite cake
can't be birthday cake.

09:05.512 --> 09:08.315
That's like saying, your favorite
kind of cereal is breakfast cereal.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.923
I love breakfast cereal.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.634
Look, some kind of bird. Let's kill it.
You talkin' to me, bitch?

09:17.824 --> 09:19.426
What were you aiming at?

09:19.551 --> 09:20.454
Nothin'.

09:28.685 --> 09:30.485
I can understand
why people like that.

09:37.090 --> 09:38.615
And keeping one's eyes open

09:38.740 --> 09:40.662
is always a good rule
of thumb around guns.

09:41.785 --> 09:43.479
This is such a great day.

09:43.604 --> 09:47.304
See, at my house I've got a wife
and three beautiful daughters.

09:48.003 --> 09:50.603
But this trip,
it is the one time of year

09:51.052 --> 09:52.948
I get to pee standing up.

09:56.646 --> 09:58.046
I love that sound.

10:00.111 --> 10:01.361
I've been shot!

10:03.447 --> 10:04.697
I've been shot!

10:12.968 --> 10:14.918
Somebody shot me in the head!

10:21.954 --> 10:22.954
My God!

10:23.481 --> 10:24.481
Over here.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.249
Ron, I have your hat.

10:26.989 --> 10:30.099
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- I was shot in the head with a shotgun!

10:30.224 --> 10:31.776
Ron, it's not that serious.

10:31.901 --> 10:33.645
I just need you to stay calm.

10:33.966 --> 10:37.016
I'm just gonna stay angry.
I find that relaxes me.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.804
Ron, we called 911,
and they're gonna send a ranger.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.132
Damn! This is a mess.

10:42.470 --> 10:44.514
The rangers won't let us
come back next year.

10:44.639 --> 10:46.601
We're not gonna think
about that right now.

10:46.726 --> 10:48.605
Can you put him on the day bed

10:48.773 --> 10:50.847
- in the carcass room?
- Day bed?

10:53.277 --> 10:54.477
Is that Donna?

11:03.843 --> 11:04.993
Are you okay?

11:05.425 --> 11:06.790
What is it, your heart?

11:06.915 --> 11:08.798
Are you having trouble breathing?

11:08.923 --> 11:09.923
Someone...

11:16.149 --> 11:18.801
- Here's your scotch, Ron.
- Jerry's here. Here's your scotch.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.069
There we go.

11:20.396 --> 11:23.826
Hey, you know what is great?
Ann's gonna take care of you.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.383
And Ann is the best nurse
in north America.

11:26.508 --> 11:28.208
All right.
There we go.

11:29.705 --> 11:32.148
- What? You okay?
- Did you... Did you shoot me?

11:32.499 --> 11:33.346
What?

11:34.485 --> 11:38.029
There was a bird kind of near me,
and I know you want to prove yourself.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.738
No, I swear I didn't.

11:39.863 --> 11:41.783
I swear to God,
I've never shot anyone.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.831
You better find out who it was.

11:43.956 --> 11:45.974
And then purchase them a coffin

11:46.099 --> 11:48.038
because I'm gonna rip them apart!

11:50.459 --> 11:51.459
Marco.

11:52.658 --> 11:53.508
Polo.

12:07.834 --> 12:10.886
How are you feeling? Are you dizzy?
Are you light-headed?

12:11.011 --> 12:13.497
When I look at my palm,
I see a lady's mouth

12:13.622 --> 12:15.172
french kissing a dog.

12:15.676 --> 12:16.651
Is that normal?

12:16.819 --> 12:19.055
The pain medication
I gave you is pretty strong.

12:19.180 --> 12:21.890
Donna uses it for menstrual cramps.
How many did you take?

12:22.015 --> 12:23.723
Seve... Eight.

12:24.366 --> 12:26.662
But I washed 'em down
with plenty of fluids.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.220
You cannot drink scotch with this!

12:29.345 --> 12:32.045
You're gonna need to purge
right now, okay?

12:32.170 --> 12:35.295
- No, I'm not wasting 20-year scotch.
- Can you open his mouth?

12:35.420 --> 12:36.838
- What?
- Open his mouth.

12:37.364 --> 12:40.579
- Open his mouth!
- I'm not making myself throw up.

12:40.952 --> 12:43.052
Ron, I'm sorry.
We have to do this.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.071
- This is for your own good.
- I'll bite you!

12:45.196 --> 12:47.531
- Open your mouth.
- Leslie, grab his moustache.

12:47.656 --> 12:48.850
Open your mouth.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.367
Get his chest up.

12:50.492 --> 12:52.728
- Open your mouth!
- His shoulders!

12:55.974 --> 12:58.525
The good news
is Ron is resting comfortably.

12:58.991 --> 13:00.611
Is he okay?
Is he gonna live?

13:01.181 --> 13:02.357
I think so.

13:02.835 --> 13:05.419
Although I am hoping
that he has some memory loss.

13:05.544 --> 13:07.994
On a scale of one to Chris Brown,
how pissed is he?

13:08.384 --> 13:11.084
Well, he's very curious
about who shot him.

13:11.271 --> 13:13.665
So if you did it,
just say "I did it".

13:15.896 --> 13:17.545
Come on, person who shot Ron.

13:21.876 --> 13:23.332
I think it's a little weird

13:23.457 --> 13:26.345
that nobody wants to admit
that they shot Ron in the head.

13:26.767 --> 13:28.430
Maybe Ron shot himself.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.381
He has seemed
really depressed lately.

13:30.506 --> 13:32.376
He was shot in the back of the head.

13:32.501 --> 13:35.694
- Right, he loves the back of his head.
- He would never shoot himself there.

13:35.819 --> 13:38.274
It could have been someone else.
Someone not in our group.

13:38.676 --> 13:40.923
You think someone is hunting us?

13:41.158 --> 13:42.853
Man is the most dangerous game.

13:42.978 --> 13:44.278
To the predator.

13:44.681 --> 13:47.034
I did smell something out there,
and it wasn't human.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.468
That was pine trees.

13:48.593 --> 13:50.064
The predator can see heat.

13:50.189 --> 13:51.662
We should cover ourselves in mud.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.289
It could still be out there.

13:54.923 --> 13:57.251
- Did you hear that?
- Actually, I did hear something.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.128
- There's someone.
- I get my gun.

13:59.296 --> 14:01.380
Scare him off.
Shoot over his head.

14:01.636 --> 14:04.210
What's that gonna do?
I'm gonna shoot under its head.

14:04.335 --> 14:06.844
- Don't shoot anyone.
- What are you doing?

14:08.002 --> 14:09.013
Don't shoot!

14:10.059 --> 14:12.559
It's Craig from Reinhold Mercedes!

14:13.268 --> 14:14.894
Craig, I got you, dawg!

14:15.052 --> 14:16.336
Don't worry, I'm comin'!

14:16.461 --> 14:18.898
Attention, person
who shot me in the head.

14:19.357 --> 14:22.307
I'm gonna find you
and I'm gonna tear you apart!

14:23.660 --> 14:25.030
Bed. Now.

14:30.153 --> 14:32.003
That man wasn't my brother.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.300
He was my husband!

14:37.641 --> 14:40.419
- How was that? That wasn't good?
- Yeah, you can do better.

14:40.587 --> 14:43.297
- Gimme another one.
- I'm pregnant...

14:44.106 --> 14:45.591
With Josh Groban's baby!

14:49.168 --> 14:50.429
That was good.

14:50.870 --> 14:51.931
You do one.

14:54.551 --> 14:56.852
What do you mean the squirrel...

14:57.348 --> 14:59.707
took the nuts out of the...

15:00.730 --> 15:04.235
Out of that kid's backpack...
And ate 'em?

15:05.558 --> 15:07.738
You have to give me
a reason to spit.

15:08.372 --> 15:09.372
To spit.

15:10.775 --> 15:14.077
- Don't ask me a question.
- I won't. Okay, not a question.

15:14.826 --> 15:17.380
I've lived in Pawnee my whole life.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.570
That is a fact.

15:23.192 --> 15:24.865
A fact about me.

15:27.466 --> 15:28.634
You have...

15:34.349 --> 15:37.034
- Hey, how is he?
- He's, pretty out of it.

15:37.159 --> 15:39.978
- He's talking about you in his sleep.
- Good stuff?

15:40.650 --> 15:42.315
- How's it going out there?
- Terribly.

15:42.696 --> 15:45.609
No one will admit they shot Ron,
and no one saw it happen.

15:45.877 --> 15:47.111
I know what happened.

15:48.170 --> 15:49.030
You do?

15:50.760 --> 15:54.201
I heard about the accident,
and I need to know who is responsible.

15:54.892 --> 15:57.079
I don't know.
That's the problem.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.164
I am.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.634
I shot Ron Swanson.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.626
You shot my Mercedes?

16:02.794 --> 16:03.944
What? No. No!

16:07.429 --> 16:10.610
You can follow my light?
No, not your whole head, just the eyes.

16:13.630 --> 16:15.222
- What month is it?
- November

16:16.042 --> 16:17.933
Why are you taking
the blame for this?

16:18.724 --> 16:21.094
Don't worry about it.
I know what I'm doing.

16:21.219 --> 16:22.869
Just go look after Ron.

16:25.859 --> 16:26.984
So what happened?

16:27.152 --> 16:29.657
Did you forget
to check the entire field?

16:29.782 --> 16:32.740
I find a lot of women have
problems with tunnel vision.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.076
No, I'm an excellent hunter.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.037
How did you end up
shooting a guy, then?

16:38.567 --> 16:39.565
Fair enough.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.498
I was walking in the woods,

16:41.623 --> 16:44.123
and then I tripped
and my gun went off.

16:44.586 --> 16:48.343
- So you forgot to put the safety on.
- No, I always have the safety on.

16:50.025 --> 16:52.817
While I was tripping, I saw a quail,

16:52.942 --> 16:54.512
and I shot at it.

16:54.853 --> 16:55.805
In mid-trip?

16:56.288 --> 16:57.973
No. That's...

16:58.908 --> 17:00.156
Okay, fine.

17:01.593 --> 17:03.443
I got that tunnel vision...

17:03.648 --> 17:04.897
That girls get.

17:06.835 --> 17:09.517
- That's what happened. End of story.
- I think you're hysterical

17:09.642 --> 17:11.701
because of all the excitement,
obviously.

17:11.826 --> 17:14.240
So I'm just not following your story.
All right?

17:16.130 --> 17:18.356
I let my emotions
get the best of me.

17:18.481 --> 17:21.539
I just...
I cared too much, I guess.

17:21.787 --> 17:24.457
I was thinking with my lady parts.

17:24.582 --> 17:26.490
I was walking,
and I felt something icky.

17:26.615 --> 17:29.600
I thought there was gonna be chocolate.
I don't even remember.

17:29.797 --> 17:33.801
I'm wearing a new bra,
and it closes in the front.

17:33.926 --> 17:36.224
So it popped open
and it threw me off.

17:36.349 --> 17:38.035
All I want to do is have babies.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.101
Are you single?
I'm going through a thing right now.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.212
I guess when my life's incomplete,
I want to shoot someone.

17:44.337 --> 17:46.837
This would not happen
if I had a penis!

17:47.083 --> 17:49.079
What?
Bitches be crazy.

17:49.204 --> 17:51.068
I'm good at tolerating pain,

17:51.575 --> 17:54.835
I'm bad at math, and I'm stupid.

17:55.620 --> 17:57.199
I wonder what they're doing.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.277
Probably making out
on top of a deer carcass.

18:00.918 --> 18:02.168
Super-romantic.

18:03.494 --> 18:06.741
You know, if I gave you a hickey,
it would totally make Ann jealous.

18:09.983 --> 18:12.603
I don't know, I think that would...
That's pretty gross.

18:12.728 --> 18:14.228
Seems kind of weird.

18:14.686 --> 18:18.136
What's weird about one friend sucking
on another friend's neck?

18:21.215 --> 18:23.517
When you put it that way,
it doesn't sound that weird at all.

18:24.072 --> 18:26.894
Yeah, it's not. I gave my gay
boyfriend's boyfriend a hickey,

18:27.019 --> 18:29.355
and it totally made
my gay boyfriend jealous.

18:29.893 --> 18:30.893
Really?

18:33.195 --> 18:34.295
All right...

18:34.960 --> 18:36.205
awesome, I'm in.

18:36.330 --> 18:38.000
I'm gonna go sterilize my neck.

18:43.932 --> 18:44.712
What?

18:45.300 --> 18:47.674
You know, Leslie,
the Super Bowl's in a couple months.

18:47.799 --> 18:49.731
I usually watch it with my brothers.

18:49.856 --> 18:53.166
Maybe you could come by at halftime
and shoot me in the head.

18:54.101 --> 18:56.971
Ron, I'm really sorry
that I ruined your weekend.

18:57.096 --> 19:00.913
Or perhaps next time I'm enjoying
some alone time in the men's restroom,

19:01.038 --> 19:03.849
you could invite yourself into my stall
and shoot me in the head.

19:05.157 --> 19:07.728
Look, if there's anything I can do
to make it up to you...

19:07.853 --> 19:09.886
Sure.
How 'bout you shoot me in the head?

19:10.011 --> 19:11.523
Wait, you already did that!

19:13.570 --> 19:16.191
Hey, Tom, can I talk to you
for a second?

19:16.316 --> 19:17.781
Hold on.
This is amazing.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.012
Now. I need to talk to you now.

19:24.829 --> 19:26.630
Are we finally gonna do this?

19:27.173 --> 19:28.673
I saw you shoot Ron.

19:28.857 --> 19:30.354
Okay, Leslie covered for you,

19:30.479 --> 19:33.670
but I won'tlet her take more crap
from Ron on your sorry-ass behalf.

19:34.223 --> 19:37.719
Okay, for the record, I was gonna
come forward, and I'll do it right now.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.386
But afterwards can we come back here
and talk about us?

19:42.722 --> 19:45.892
Maybe the next time I'm at the doctor's
office getting my prostate examined,

19:46.017 --> 19:48.139
you could come by
and shoot me in the head.

19:48.264 --> 19:49.686
Excuse me, everyone.

19:49.854 --> 19:51.939
Ron, I have something to say.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.253
Hang on a minute.
I'm not done berating Leslie.

19:54.378 --> 19:56.067
It wasn't Leslie's fault.

19:56.813 --> 20:00.362
She was covering for me
because I didn't have a hunting license.

20:01.804 --> 20:04.201
- I was the one who shot you.
- You didn't get a license?

20:04.800 --> 20:07.204
What kind of moron
doesn't get a license?

20:07.372 --> 20:09.480
That's reckless endangerment,
my son.

20:09.605 --> 20:11.938
That's a $25,000 fine, minimum.

20:12.164 --> 20:13.544
And probably jail time.

20:13.972 --> 20:15.838
But she covered for me,

20:16.006 --> 20:17.406
and I'm in the clear.

20:17.531 --> 20:18.681
That's right.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.927
She kept her mouth shut,
and now you're in the clear.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.177
- You know, I couldn't let...
- I know.

20:25.374 --> 20:26.524
You did good.

20:30.072 --> 20:31.478
You're a real stand-up guy.

20:32.676 --> 20:34.189
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

20:34.878 --> 20:37.496
It was because I was shot
in the head by a moron.

20:37.621 --> 20:38.902
Dude, Ron, I'm so sorry.

20:39.070 --> 20:41.106
Apology not accepted, moron.

20:45.441 --> 20:46.535
Pants king.

20:47.332 --> 20:48.495
Pants queen.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.543
The turkeys are great.

21:09.793 --> 21:11.193
Welcome back, Ron.

21:12.431 --> 21:14.100
"Welcome back, Ron."

21:15.345 --> 21:17.595
That's terrific.
Thanks, you guys.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.359
Let's eat!
