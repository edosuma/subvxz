03:05.881 --> 03:07.143
Aah.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.753
You just got me
shot in the face.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.624
Breakfast is ready.
You're gonna be late for school.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.931
Round's almost over.
Can I just get a few more kills?

03:12.975 --> 03:15.151
Sure, we could do that.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.934
I could also hop on the headset
and tell your friends

03:16.935 --> 03:18.762
what a wonderful, thoughtful,
handsome boy you are.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.243
Don't be obscene.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.027
Come on, little man.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.030
- Have a nice day, boys.
- Bye.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.075
- Mom.
- Bye, Mrs. Bell.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.118
Go.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.886
Almost made it through
a full load this time.

03:37.086 --> 03:39.001
I thought dad fixed it.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.481
So did I.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.451
Perfect.

04:01.545 --> 04:02.851
Hi, baby.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.766

Hi.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.246
Mom, have you seen my lunch?

04:51.247 --> 04:53.554
- It's in the fridge.
- No, it's not.

04:53.597 --> 04:55.338
Yes, it is.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.472
Yeah, here we go.

05:00.517 --> 05:01.953
Good morning.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.653
Hey, you're late.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.611
I know,
I'm sorry.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.396
I still haven't gotten
used to the alarm.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.709
- Really?
- Oh.

05:19.754 --> 05:20.798
Hi, baby.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.147
Turtle kiss.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.719
Well, kiddo,
you ready for school?

05:28.763 --> 05:30.895
It's okay,
I'll take him.

05:30.939 --> 05:33.202
- No, it's okay, I'll do it.
- It's fine, James.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.507
I already got Riley
in the car seat.

05:34.508 --> 05:35.769
You're gonna be late
for your pitch.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.641
So just go to work.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.515
I'll be in the car.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.651
Hey, I'm sorry.

05:47.695 --> 05:48.956
You said you were
gonna fix the dryer.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.785
I know. I will.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.831
I can't be the
only one trying here.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.357
And the latch on
the front door is broken.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.750
I'll do it tonight, okay?
I promise.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.491
If you say so.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.798
No, no, no, stop.
How long are we gonna do this?

06:05.016 --> 06:06.844
There's coffee in the pot.

06:28.518 --> 06:29.998
Ha ha.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.870
- Hey.
- You're late.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.437
Meeting's not for
another 20 minutes.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.787
And what about prep?

06:36.831 --> 06:38.615
We've been
busting our ass

06:38.659 --> 06:40.965
on this pitch for the
last six months. We're ready.

06:41.009 --> 06:43.446
Besides, knowing you, you've
been here for the past two hours

06:43.490 --> 06:45.796
color coding
our talking points.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.842
Well, you have 20 minutes
to memorize.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.106
Oh, wow.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.934
I appreciate
the level of crafting

06:52.977 --> 06:54.979
that went into
making these, but...

06:55.023 --> 06:56.328
we're good.

07:00.071 --> 07:02.987
Lauren, the logo
that you designed works fine.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.120
I was just hoping for something
a little more

07:05.163 --> 07:06.730
I don't know, creative?

07:07.949 --> 07:09.690
Okay, well...

07:09.733 --> 07:11.605
I can definitely
mock up some alternatives.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.697
Hey...

07:17.741 --> 07:18.742
Lauren?

07:18.786 --> 07:20.483
You there?

07:20.527 --> 07:22.093
Whoa! Oh.

07:22.137 --> 07:23.921
I'm-I'm-I'm right here.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.227
I'm okay.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.011
Yeah.
I am right here.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.102
Yeah, Gina, sorry.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.234
I am here.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.149
Okay, so...

07:34.192 --> 07:37.108
What were you looking for?
Maybe you have some

07:37.152 --> 07:40.198
inspirational images
you could send me.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.853
Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to
send you my Pinterest page.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.508
I think it'll give you a better
sense of what I'm looking for.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.467
I am emailing you the link now.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.860
Perfect.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.776
Lauren, are you sure that you're
ready to take on this project?

07:52.820 --> 07:54.298
I mean, I know that
things are busy at home

07:54.299 --> 07:55.257
with the baby
and everything.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.998
What?
No!

07:57.041 --> 07:59.783
I'm a 100 percent ready.

07:59.827 --> 08:03.570
And I'm looking at your
Pinterest page right now.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.834
It's beautiful.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.488
Totally get what
you're goin' for.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.315
Great, yeah.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.794
Alright, so I definitely
want something

08:11.795 --> 08:13.362
that has the feeling of movement

08:13.405 --> 08:15.669
but is
captured in still image.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.365
So, when people see it,
I want them to think...

08:17.366 --> 08:18.802
Inspiring.

08:18.846 --> 08:21.152
Movement. Dancer.

08:23.633 --> 08:26.462
Gina, you've given me
so much to work with

08:26.506 --> 08:29.334
I'd love to just process it and
get back to you later, okay?

08:29.378 --> 08:30.988
Yeah, sure.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.424

09:17.513 --> 09:19.602
You two, well done.

paperwork to draw up.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.527
Umm...

09:33.355 --> 09:35.096
- Yeah.
- Umm...

09:35.139 --> 09:37.838
You, you, you seriously did a...
You did a great job.

- Tsk.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.625
Okay.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.888
Ah, look, I...

09:44.932 --> 09:47.891
I know that this contract is
gonna require a lot of work.

09:47.935 --> 09:51.242
Lot of overtime,
late nights.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.072
Yes, I'm-I'm...
I can do that.

09:55.116 --> 09:58.336
Okay, good,
I just wanted to make sure.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.818
Um, and...

10:01.862 --> 10:03.646
and I know I've said this
a hundred times

10:03.690 --> 10:06.040
but I'm so, so sorry for...

10:11.872 --> 10:13.482
Umm...

10:13.525 --> 10:14.875
- I need to...
- Oh, yeah.

10:14.918 --> 10:15.918
Yeah.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.883
Lauren?

10:26.321 --> 10:27.321
What?

10:34.024 --> 10:36.026
I got here as fast as I could.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.549
Is everything okay?

10:37.593 --> 10:39.464
Mr. Bell,
I'm Detective Schneider.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.684
Did your wife fill you in
on what happened?

10:41.728 --> 10:44.121
Umm, a little,
but I'm confused.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.036
Did somebody try to
break into the house?

10:46.080 --> 10:48.343
Well, no, there was
no sign of forced entry.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.998
But are you aware that the latch
on your front door is broken?

10:52.739 --> 10:56.699
Yeah, and the... glass door
won't shut, I...

10:56.743 --> 10:58.614
I know.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.399
A crawler and a door
that won't close?

11:01.443 --> 11:03.663
But what about the woman?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.099
Woman?

11:05.142 --> 11:06.666
There was a woman, singing.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.927
I-I heard her
on the baby monitor.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.581
When I went up to the nursery

11:09.625 --> 11:11.627
no one was, was there.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.760
I heard a voice,
I'm not crazy.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.370
I believe you.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.589
Right now, all evidence
is pointing to

11:17.633 --> 11:20.810
you're being the victim of
a baby monitor hack.

11:20.854 --> 11:23.030
With these older models,
it's pretty easy.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.857
You can hop on the channel
with a walkie-talkie.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.729
Why would somebody do that?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.209
A prank?

11:28.252 --> 11:30.385
Again, it wouldn't be
the first time.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.779
And honestly, you were lucky
it got you to check on Riley

11:32.822 --> 11:34.694
before she crawled
into the street.

11:34.737 --> 11:38.523
And thankfully, Owen arrived
to grab her when he did.

11:38.567 --> 11:41.831
Our old neighbor,
Owen Leary?

11:41.875 --> 11:44.007
Yeah, he
stopped by just in time.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.532
Hi, James.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.318
Hi, Owen.

11:50.361 --> 11:53.234
Thank you. I-I hear that
we owe you big time.

11:53.277 --> 11:56.367
- I'm just glad I was here.
- Thank God you were here.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.282
Yeah, it could have
been a lot worse.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.284
Now, unfortunately,
there's no way to

12:00.328 --> 12:02.025
track or prosecute
a hack like this.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.158
I suggest upgrading
to a newer model

12:04.201 --> 12:05.481
to keep it from happening again.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.422
And it wouldn't hurt
to invest in

12:07.465 --> 12:10.773
a password-protected
video monitor.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.949
Keep an eye on
that little devil.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.559
Make sure she doesn't
make a run for it.

12:14.603 --> 12:18.215
We will.
Thank you, detective.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.435
Is there
anything else you need?

12:20.478 --> 12:22.567
No. But, Owen,
let's review that statement.

12:22.611 --> 12:23.960
Yeah, yeah, okay.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.441
Owen.

12:26.484 --> 12:29.183
- Again, thank you.
- Yeah.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.619
No problem.

12:38.888 --> 12:41.412
Give me a call
if there's another hack.

12:41.456 --> 12:44.415
And, uh... fix these doors.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.552
So, you think
it was just a hack?

12:50.595 --> 12:51.814
I don't know.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.730
Maybe, I guess?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.950
I just can't believe Riley
could get out like that.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.301
And I didn't even notice.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.393
It's not your fault.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.177
Yes, it is.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.701
I have been treading
so much water lately.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.836
Let me back ya.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.795
We can make this work.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.755
I'm sure they need you
back at the office.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.109
I'm not the one who wanted this.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.546
Neither did I.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.600
Owen.

14:23.950 --> 14:24.950
What's goin' on?

14:25.777 --> 14:28.998
Check it out.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.479
You f,
you fixed our door?

14:31.522 --> 14:34.003
Yeah, after I talked
to the detective

14:34.047 --> 14:36.963
I hit up the...
hardware store, and...

14:37.006 --> 14:39.617
Front door that doesn't
stay close, no good.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.622
Uh, did Lauren
ask you to do that?

14:44.666 --> 14:47.451
Ah, she didn't put me to work
or anything, but...

14:47.495 --> 14:49.323
after what happened

14:49.366 --> 14:51.107
I couldn't just leave it broken.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.460
Okay.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.332
- Well...
- Oh.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.942
Here you are, sir.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.423
Thank you.

15:07.341 --> 15:08.908
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, buddy.

15:13.477 --> 15:17.264
So, uh, Owen's
back in town, huh?

15:17.307 --> 15:19.135
Yeah, winter break.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.790
That's great.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.097
Umm, is your mom around?

15:24.140 --> 15:26.926
She's out back,
doing laundry.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.017
Oh, boy.

15:43.072 --> 15:46.510
Feeling really bad about
that dryer right now.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.556
Well, you can help,
if it makes you feel better.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.518
Ran into Owen.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.346
Looks like he's
got the door fixed.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.654
Yeah, that was nice of him.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.395
I was gonna fix it.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.700
I know.

16:02.744 --> 16:05.877
But now you don't have to.

16:05.921 --> 16:07.967
He helped me pick out
a nanny cam today too.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.099
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.014
Set it up and everything.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.016
He can install it
on your laptop

16:14.060 --> 16:15.713
if you wanna keep
an eye on Riley.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.979
Seems like he's been
quite the help today.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.546
He has.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.333
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.685
I'm... I wanna ask him
to help out around the house.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.382
What?

16:32.426 --> 16:34.906
I know he needs the money,
and honestly...

16:34.950 --> 16:36.125
ahem, we need the help.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.173
So, you want him to
be our nanny.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.742
- Manny.
- Manny?

16:44.786 --> 16:46.831
He used to watch
Carter all the time.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.235
Don't you remember
how good he was?

16:48.268 --> 16:49.443
And Carter loves him.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.228
I don't know.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.231
James...

16:55.275 --> 16:57.320
I need someone around here.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.540
And I've known Owen practically
his whole life.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.628
I used to babysit him.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.767
Okay, look, if that's what you
want, then let's ask him.

17:10.637 --> 17:11.856
Thank you.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.949
Actually, I was thinking about
asking him tonight over dinner.

17:17.992 --> 17:20.300
I know it's kind of
a big decision, so...

17:20.343 --> 17:22.650
maybe you wanna
come over and...

17:22.693 --> 17:24.260
we can ask him together.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.481
Yeah, I'd-I'd like that.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.705
Hey, Lauren,
the oven just went off.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.055
Thanks, I'll be right in.

17:39.014 --> 17:41.016
Hey...

17:41.060 --> 17:42.757
What are you doing for dinner?

17:51.200 --> 17:54.203
Wow! Seriously, Lauren, this,
this is incredible.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.293
Oh, it's really nothing special.

17:59.165 --> 18:02.429
Are you kidding?
This is heaven.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.953
I've been eating ramen off of
a hot plate for the last month.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.130
College sounds terrible.

18:11.264 --> 18:14.484
So, how's it goin'?
You still studying music?

18:14.528 --> 18:17.008
Yeah, it's been good.
Pretty busy.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.402
Tryin' to write my own stuff
between classes.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.187
That's amazing.

18:21.230 --> 18:24.668
Well, don't go gushing
until you've heard it.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.322
So, Owen, are you
just passing through

18:26.366 --> 18:28.237
or are you gonna stay
for a little while?

18:28.281 --> 18:30.805
No, I'll-I'll be here. I'm
staying at my mom's in Blaine.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.503
So, not too far away.

18:33.547 --> 18:36.245
Oh, I miss Beth.
How is she doin'?

18:36.289 --> 18:38.204
I've barely talked to her
since you guys moved.

18:38.247 --> 18:41.381
Oh, she's been better.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.644
She had an accident at work
a few weeks ago

18:43.687 --> 18:45.341
so, been mostly in bed since.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.215
But luckily, campus is
only half an hour away

18:50.216 --> 18:52.174
so I've been able to
finish finals

18:52.218 --> 18:53.958
and take care of her.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.006
I'm so sorry, that's awful.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.618
Maybe I'll give her a call.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.272
Yeah, she, uh...

19:03.316 --> 19:05.883
she'd like that.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.057
I think I might take next
semester off

19:07.058 --> 19:08.886
and help around the house.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.170
'Cause I doubt she'll be going
back to work anytime soon.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.543
So...

19:13.587 --> 19:16.851
you guys hear of anyone looking
to hire a struggling musician

19:16.894 --> 19:18.635
without a degree

19:18.679 --> 19:20.507
let me know.

19:20.550 --> 19:23.553
Actually, we were thinking...

19:26.252 --> 19:28.558
You really saved us today.

19:28.602 --> 19:29.819
How would you feel about
helping out

19:29.820 --> 19:32.214
around the house
like you used to?

19:32.258 --> 19:35.565
- Really?
- Definitely.

19:35.609 --> 19:38.177
We could use
an extra set of hands.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.440
We could start up
guitar lessons again.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.790
I suck.
Like, really bad.

19:44.574 --> 19:46.315
Of course, I would love to.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.885
Well, this is cause
for celebration.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.060
I'll get the champagne.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.540
None for you.

20:11.993 --> 20:15.301
Well, looks like
we have our Manny.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.433
Thank you for being
so supportive of this.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.437
Of course, it's...

20:21.481 --> 20:24.484
whatever's best for the family.
That's all I want.

20:24.527 --> 20:25.920
And now you have
that nanny cam app

20:25.963 --> 20:28.009
so you can
keep an eye on things.

20:31.012 --> 20:34.015
Well, I better get to bed.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.581
Things are gonna start revving
up at work.

20:35.582 --> 20:38.672
We, um, we got that contract.

20:40.674 --> 20:41.979
James, that's great.

20:42.980 --> 20:43.980
Thanks.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.463
Which means we're probably
gonna have a lotta

20:48.464 --> 20:50.161
late nights again.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.168
Kiss the kids goodnight
for me.

21:33.901 --> 21:35.772
I got you, sweetie.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.779
Hmm.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.259
Guess it works.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.262
Okay, honey.

22:51.065 --> 22:52.588
That's okay.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.982
Just jumpy, I guess.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.420
We can holster
that left hook.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.813
I'm here now.

23:03.164 --> 23:04.948
I see that freelancing
is going strong.

23:04.992 --> 23:06.341
Oh.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.560
It has its ups and downs

23:07.603 --> 23:10.432
but, goin' steady.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.261
I'm not surprised,
that is really good.

23:13.304 --> 23:15.829
Thanks.
I thought so too.

23:15.872 --> 23:18.135
But my client isn't so enthused.

23:18.179 --> 23:20.442
That's what happens when
art meets commerce, right?

23:20.486 --> 23:21.766
But don't worry
about it too much

23:21.791 --> 23:23.576
'cause you're
a real artist and

23:23.619 --> 23:26.013
you'll come up with
something brilliant.

23:26.056 --> 23:28.711
In the meantime, I'll get
started on cleaning the house.

23:28.755 --> 23:31.105
You don't have to do that.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.672
It's cool.

23:32.715 --> 23:35.239
You hired me to help
so just let me help.

23:35.283 --> 23:39.418
Besides, cleaning is like a
Zen practice for me.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.463
Opens up the airways.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.378
Gets creative juices flowin'.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.903
Okay.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.557

25:13.468 --> 25:15.949
I can't remember the last time
somebody else cooked dinner.

25:15.992 --> 25:19.387
I know it isn't
exactly cuisine, but...

25:19.430 --> 25:21.520
hopefully it's edible.

25:21.563 --> 25:24.523
It's great.
Thank you.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.525
Well, it's a shame James
couldn't join us.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.850
Sorry, I shoulda
told you earlier.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.924
He's, um, not usually
here for dinner.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.842
Oh. The work
keeps him pretty late?

25:39.886 --> 25:41.540
Mm-hmm.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.150
May I be excused?

25:45.326 --> 25:48.111
Oh, you don't want any more?

25:48.155 --> 25:49.548
Not hungry.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.864
I'm sorry,
did I say something?

26:01.908 --> 26:06.173
No, it's,
it's not your fault.

26:06.216 --> 26:10.220
We've all been going through
some adjustments lately

26:10.264 --> 26:12.092
and we're still figuring it out.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.529
Yeah.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.184
Carter mentioned
something earlier.

26:17.227 --> 26:21.188
Obviously, it's none
of my business

26:21.231 --> 26:23.451
but I don't wanna say something
that'll make it worse.

26:23.494 --> 26:24.757
He talked to you about it?

26:26.280 --> 26:28.238
What did he say?

26:28.282 --> 26:30.850
I don't know, Lauren, um...

26:32.199 --> 26:34.549
Please.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.986
I know he acts like
it doesn't bother him, but...

26:37.030 --> 26:39.119
I'm worried.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.947
He won't talk to me about it.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.865
You got something to drink?

27:01.010 --> 27:03.665
Carter didn't tell me a lot.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.754
Just that you guys were...

27:07.756 --> 27:09.584
y-you know...

27:09.628 --> 27:11.847
Separated.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.762
- Yeah.
- It's okay, you can say it.

27:17.723 --> 27:20.334
It's, it's weird,
'cause you guys...

27:20.377 --> 27:22.577
You always seemed like the
happiest couple on the block.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.122
We were.

27:26.166 --> 27:27.689
And then...

27:27.733 --> 27:30.126
he got distant.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.476
He started working later
and later and...

27:36.393 --> 27:38.395
There is a girl at his office.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.658
Summer.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.227
Oh.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.538
Lauren, I'm, I'm sorry.

27:53.367 --> 27:54.673
Yeah, me too.

27:58.633 --> 28:01.941
When we had Riley, I thought
things'll get back to normal.

28:04.595 --> 28:07.686
But... Maybe maybe they still
will, who knows?

28:07.729 --> 28:09.470
Seems like he's trying harder.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.910
I am sorry to unload
all this on you.

28:16.433 --> 28:17.696
But...

28:19.785 --> 28:22.744
It's, it's okay, really.

28:22.788 --> 28:26.400
If you wanna talk,
I'm always happy to listen.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.576
I don't think Carter's
the only one

28:28.619 --> 28:30.143
acting like it
doesn't bother him.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.103
And if you ignore it

28:34.147 --> 28:35.467
it's just gonna make
things worse.

28:40.849 --> 28:43.069
When did you grow up so much?

28:43.112 --> 28:44.723
You are not the boy
I used to babysit.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.595
No, I'm not.

28:59.694 --> 29:00.869
Hey!

29:01.827 --> 29:03.132
Hey!

29:03.176 --> 29:04.655
Evening, James.

29:08.268 --> 29:09.878
Oh, I should go check on her.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.750
- You need help?
- Oh, no, I got it.

30:32.743 --> 30:33.744
What's that?

30:35.181 --> 30:37.836
Aw. Crying baby.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.626
Oh, no, no, no, no.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.837
- Excuse me! Hey!
- What?

31:22.881 --> 31:24.317
Keep it down, please.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.318
There's baby inside
trying to sleep.

31:25.361 --> 31:26.754
Give me a break, kid.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.432
What the hell!

32:10.841 --> 32:14.149
What? Oh, come on.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.549
You okay?

32:22.592 --> 32:25.204
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just dealing with Gina.

32:25.247 --> 32:27.161
I've been killing myself
with these designs for her

32:27.162 --> 32:28.642
and she doesn't like
any of them.

32:28.685 --> 32:32.559
What you need is a break,
some fresh air.

32:32.602 --> 32:35.083
Yeah, maybe I'll take the yacht
out for a spin.

32:35.127 --> 32:38.347
I'm serious. Go get outta here.
Grab lunch with a friend.

32:38.391 --> 32:41.089
- I can't.
- Why not?

32:46.268 --> 32:49.010
Carter's at school,
I can watch Riley.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.056
Work's gonna be here
when you get back.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.974
You'll be gone, what, two hours?
We'll be fine.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.674
You do deserve it.

33:07.159 --> 33:08.334
Yes.

33:14.601 --> 33:17.908
Megan. Hi, this is Lauren.

33:17.952 --> 33:20.172
What are you doing for lunch?

33:20.215 --> 33:22.087
Can you get away
from your patients?

33:31.052 --> 33:34.142
See you soon, mommy.
Bye.

34:20.145 --> 34:23.277
What do you think, Riley?
Should we keep an eye on him?

34:23.322 --> 34:25.106
Yeah.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.065
I think we should.

34:34.855 --> 34:37.031
I'm not kidding. Do you know
what I would give

34:37.074 --> 34:40.165
to have a man
at my house at my beck and call?

34:40.208 --> 34:42.036
- He's a Manny.
- Hmm.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.299
Not a... whatever inappropriate
thing you're imagining.

34:44.342 --> 34:45.431
Uh-huh.

34:46.867 --> 34:49.522
So, do you have a picture?

34:49.565 --> 34:52.045
What? I'm-I'm curious.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.397
I mean, I did take time out
of my very busy day.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.617
- Fine.
- Mm-hmm.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.749
I think I have a picture of him
with Riley.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.708
Good, 'cause I need to see
that baby girl.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.275
Let me see her.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.407
Oh, my God! She's beautiful,
look at that.

35:05.451 --> 35:08.715
And, yeah, that's definitely
the model that I would want.

35:13.894 --> 35:16.331
- What?
- Mm.

35:16.375 --> 35:19.595
I just... I swear
I've seen him before.

35:19.639 --> 35:23.164
Maybe he winked at you online,
and you internet-stalked him.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.124
Sadly, that's entirely possible.

35:26.167 --> 35:27.908
Oh, I missed you.

35:27.951 --> 35:30.606
I went from seeing you
every week to almost never.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.260
Who would've thought
I'd miss the clinic?

35:32.304 --> 35:35.916
Yeah. Well, so...
How are things?

35:37.222 --> 35:39.441
With James.

35:39.485 --> 35:42.662
Honestly... I don't know.

35:45.491 --> 35:48.058
Mm, was it crazy to think that,
that things would magically

35:48.102 --> 35:50.887
go back to normal
once we had Riley?

35:50.931 --> 35:53.803
No, it's a difficult process.

35:53.847 --> 35:56.284
And even when IVF
is successful, it's...

35:56.328 --> 35:58.568
Plenty of people still go
through depression and anxiety.

36:02.769 --> 36:05.119
What am I supposed to do?

36:05.163 --> 36:06.772
You know, I tried to include him
in everything

36:06.773 --> 36:08.688
but he was never there.

36:08.731 --> 36:10.864
It's like, all of his focus
was at work...

36:12.735 --> 36:14.737
or with her.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.569
But I do know that I want James
to be a part of Riley's life

36:20.613 --> 36:21.962
and Carter's.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.184
What about yours?

36:49.859 --> 36:52.035
No way.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.255
I can't believe
you fixed it.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.910
I have been on James for a week
to fix this thing.

36:56.953 --> 36:58.651
How did you even know
how to do it?

36:58.694 --> 37:00.566
I'm a struggling musician.

37:00.609 --> 37:02.655
You learn to take whatever job
comes your way.

37:02.698 --> 37:06.963
I've done IT,
sales... handyman.

37:07.007 --> 37:11.272
You name it, there's
a good chance I've done it.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.579
Have I told you
how amazing you are?

37:13.622 --> 37:15.624
I'll never get tired
of hearing it.

37:17.713 --> 37:19.976
Now, this load is almost done.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.196
Don't even think about folding,
I am on top of it.

38:05.195 --> 38:07.328
Strum, nice and slow.

38:09.678 --> 38:12.681
Yeah. I'm telling you, man,
you're getting good.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.465
You sure you didn't practice
while I was away at school?

38:14.466 --> 38:16.816
Don't patronize me.
I know how bad I am.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.513
Just help me become a rock God.

38:18.557 --> 38:21.342
Wow.
Carter, you're shredding.

38:21.386 --> 38:23.518
Thanks, dad.
I appreciate the support.

38:23.562 --> 38:25.780
Listen, buddy, I know it's been
crazy at the office lately

38:25.781 --> 38:28.567
but what do you say I blow off
work early tonight

38:28.610 --> 38:30.090
we go out,
just the two of us?

38:32.179 --> 38:35.704
Sorry, dad, I can't. Owen's
taking me to a show tonight.

38:35.748 --> 38:37.314
I promise you have
nothing to worry about.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.665
It's a clean band.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.623
Well, mostly.

38:41.667 --> 38:45.584
Ha ha. Yeah.
I'm not worried about it.

38:45.627 --> 38:49.283
Mom said it was okay.
I can go, right?

38:49.327 --> 38:51.329
Yeah. Of course.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.376
- Thanks.
- Sure, okay.

38:57.987 --> 38:59.859
Alright.
Let's do it again.

39:01.556 --> 39:03.950
Fast.

39:03.993 --> 39:06.474
I don't know.
Am I, am I overreacting?

39:06.518 --> 39:08.084
Maybe.

39:08.128 --> 39:10.478
Well, I can't help it.

39:10.522 --> 39:12.349
I mean, I've been doing
everything I can to make

39:12.350 --> 39:16.658
Lauren happy, and this, this kid
gets to stay in my house

39:16.702 --> 39:19.182
be with my wife, and then,
and then he's taking my son

39:19.226 --> 39:21.097
to his very first concert.

39:21.141 --> 39:25.058
So, yeah, yeah. I'm pissed.
I'm kinda pissed.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.159
Damn it.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.165
Hey.

39:50.083 --> 39:53.086
You know, a couple of us
are going to McFaren's later.

39:53.129 --> 39:55.001
If you wanna come.

40:01.268 --> 40:04.227
Yes. Sink those claws in.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.362
That won't be a good idea.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.322
Right.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.239
Well, this got boring.

40:18.807 --> 40:21.288
Lauren, where are you?

40:21.331 --> 40:24.204
Hey. What's going on?

40:29.514 --> 40:31.429
I felt bad bailing on dad today.

40:33.518 --> 40:37.304
We haven't really hung out
in a while.

40:37.347 --> 40:39.088
It got me thinking.

40:40.916 --> 40:44.442
What's going on
with you and dad?

40:44.485 --> 40:47.053
I don't want him to leave.

40:47.096 --> 40:49.490
I promise...

40:49.534 --> 40:52.754
no matter what happens
he will be in your life.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.539
Do you understand me?

40:56.889 --> 40:58.717
Dad's not going anywhere.

41:35.710 --> 41:37.407
Hey, rock star.

41:45.241 --> 41:46.547
Show's already over?

41:48.157 --> 41:51.421
Um, no. Owen had to cancel.

41:51.465 --> 41:53.380
Said he had to help out his mom.

41:53.423 --> 41:56.035
Oh. I'm sorry, buddy.

41:56.078 --> 41:57.383
I know you were looking
forward to that.

41:57.384 --> 41:58.951
It's fine.

42:01.823 --> 42:04.391
Hey, uh, what's the awful title
to that horror movie

42:04.434 --> 42:06.480
you've been tryin'
to get to us watch?

42:06.524 --> 42:10.005
- "Blood Shower?"
- "Blood Shower."

42:10.049 --> 42:13.095
How about we order some
pizza, make some s'mores

42:13.139 --> 42:15.533
and watch a bunch of people
get hacked to pieces?

42:15.576 --> 42:17.665
Really?

42:17.709 --> 42:20.494
I mean, if it's okay
with your mother.

42:24.411 --> 42:26.587
- I'll order the pizza now.
- Yes.

42:29.111 --> 42:30.503
I'm sorry you guys
didn't get the Grubber deal.

42:30.504 --> 42:31.765
Yeah. It's okay,
we'll get the next one.

42:31.766 --> 42:34.116
Mm-hmm.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.510
- Um, I'm gonna grab another.
- Sure. Yeah.

42:40.601 --> 42:42.560
- Can I have a shot of fireball?
- Sure.

42:42.603 --> 42:43.691
Thanks.

43:00.882 --> 43:02.101
Hey.

43:03.668 --> 43:05.060
This one's on me, alright?

43:07.672 --> 43:08.890
Thanks.

43:12.328 --> 43:14.896
Wow. Striking out, huh?

43:19.074 --> 43:21.120
Sorry, it's just...

43:21.163 --> 43:22.991
It's not really a good night
for me.

43:24.906 --> 43:26.299
You waiting on somebody?

43:32.435 --> 43:33.698
I guess not.

45:46.918 --> 45:48.267
Whoa.

45:56.362 --> 45:57.362
Now!

46:06.198 --> 46:08.591
- I can't believe you.
- Lauren, listen to me.

46:08.635 --> 46:10.028
I had nothing to do with this.

46:10.071 --> 46:12.421
"Lauren, I'm sorry,
it wasn't my fault.

46:12.465 --> 46:14.859
She was drunk,
she kissed me."

46:14.902 --> 46:17.078
Are-are we gonna have
the same fight

46:17.122 --> 46:18.776
over and over again?
Is that...

46:18.819 --> 46:20.908
Are you gonna keep sleeping
with your coworkers?

46:20.952 --> 46:24.042
I saw the photo, James.

46:24.085 --> 46:25.913
A woman doesn't just send
a photo like this.

46:25.957 --> 46:27.175
Well, she did.

46:27.219 --> 46:30.178
Oh, really?

46:30.222 --> 46:33.138
We never had sex!
Do you understand that?

46:33.181 --> 46:35.096
You expect me to believe that?

46:35.140 --> 46:37.316
Get out. I want you out
of the guest house

46:37.359 --> 46:38.708
by tomorrow morning.

46:38.752 --> 46:41.146
- Lauren...
- I don't wanna hear it.

46:41.189 --> 46:42.756
Just shut up and leave.

46:44.845 --> 46:46.585
I'm gonna go talk to her,
and then I'm gonna prove to you

46:46.586 --> 46:47.630
that this was a mistake.

46:47.674 --> 46:48.893
Get out of my house.

46:57.727 --> 47:00.861
It's okay. He's finally gone.

47:03.037 --> 47:04.909
I'm gonna fix it.

47:06.171 --> 47:09.000
I'm gonna fix everything.

47:23.753 --> 47:25.059
Hey, Jamesy!

47:26.321 --> 47:27.801
Mornin'.

48:00.181 --> 48:02.009
Lauren, I'm, I'm so sorry.

48:54.453 --> 48:55.845
You wanna talk?

49:00.763 --> 49:04.637
I don't know why I thought
things would change.

49:04.680 --> 49:08.858
- God, I feel so stupid.
- Oh, don't say that.

49:08.902 --> 49:10.556
You're brilliant.

49:14.777 --> 49:16.431
You're creative...

49:17.606 --> 49:18.607
incredible...

49:20.958 --> 49:21.958
beautiful.

49:25.092 --> 49:28.617
If James can't see
how amazing you are

49:28.661 --> 49:30.010
he's the stupid one.

49:52.337 --> 49:53.729
Oh, my God.

50:07.439 --> 50:08.570
James.

50:11.095 --> 50:12.618
Detective Schneider.

50:12.661 --> 50:16.056
This is Detective Klein
from Homicide.

50:16.100 --> 50:17.405
We need to talk.

50:34.335 --> 50:35.684
Creative block?

50:38.426 --> 50:39.775
Something like that.

50:45.781 --> 50:49.133
Well, it's a curse
of being an artist.

50:49.176 --> 50:51.265
Our muses can be very fickle.

50:51.309 --> 50:52.701
Believe me, I know.

50:54.877 --> 50:56.444
Owen...

50:56.488 --> 50:59.360
You're still thinkin'
about it too.

50:59.404 --> 51:00.622
No.

51:02.146 --> 51:04.061
No.

51:04.104 --> 51:06.019
That was a mistake.

51:07.629 --> 51:10.545
I was hurt and confused...

51:11.851 --> 51:14.114
and I just wanted...

51:14.158 --> 51:16.899
I just wanted to feel
appreciated again.

51:16.943 --> 51:19.424
It never should have happened.

51:19.467 --> 51:21.643
And it can't happen again.

51:28.215 --> 51:30.913
Her roommate found her
this morning.

51:30.957 --> 51:33.477
Hanging from the rafters with an
extension cord around her neck.

51:34.961 --> 51:37.137
Medical examiner hasn't
published a report yet

51:37.181 --> 51:40.227
but, seems pretty
cut and dry suicide.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.681
Last contact she had while alive
was the text she sent to you.

51:59.725 --> 52:01.422
So, any information
you can give us

52:01.466 --> 52:03.163
will be helpful.

52:03.207 --> 52:06.123
For the both of us.

52:06.166 --> 52:08.908
Because honestly, if this isn't
a suicide then...

52:08.951 --> 52:11.824
you're the only lead we've got.

52:11.867 --> 52:15.088
I'm gonna go for a walk
and clear my head.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.221
Don't worry about Riley,
I'll take her with me.

52:26.882 --> 52:28.406
I'm sorry it happened.

52:32.845 --> 52:34.455
So, anything you want to say?

52:36.414 --> 52:38.198
Well, if anything comes to mind

52:38.242 --> 52:40.722
or you just wanna grab a coffee
and chat, give me a call.

53:02.527 --> 53:04.137
- Lauren.
- Just leave me alone.

53:04.181 --> 53:07.227
- Summer's dead.
- What?

53:08.315 --> 53:10.099
Can I please come inside?

53:15.496 --> 53:18.499
Owen, I-it's fine,
I invited him in.

53:18.543 --> 53:20.980
Actually, why don't you
take Carter out back?

53:21.023 --> 53:22.286
James and I need to talk.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.507
Come on, let's go check
on your sister and practice.

53:37.301 --> 53:38.650
I don't...

53:40.260 --> 53:42.915
- How'd it happen?
- Suicide.

53:45.961 --> 53:47.963
At least that's what
the police think.

53:49.617 --> 53:52.141
"What the police think?"
I mean...

53:52.185 --> 53:55.188
You don't agree?

53:55.232 --> 53:57.669
Lauren, I knew Summer,
and I don't think that she'd

53:57.712 --> 53:58.756
send those pictures, and I know

53:58.757 --> 54:01.760
that she would not kill herself

54:01.803 --> 54:04.806
especially over something
that's not even there.

54:04.850 --> 54:06.678
What are you saying?

54:06.721 --> 54:09.507
Things were gettin' better.

54:09.550 --> 54:11.595
I feel like we're starting
to get everything back on track

54:11.596 --> 54:15.600
and then... he shows up.

54:15.643 --> 54:18.994
- Owen?
- He disappeared last night.

54:19.038 --> 54:21.214
He was supposed to take Carter
to the concert. Right?

54:21.258 --> 54:23.564
Yeah, and then he cancels
last second.

54:23.608 --> 54:25.688
You're not suggesting
what I think you're suggesting?

54:25.697 --> 54:27.089
Why not?

54:27.133 --> 54:28.917
Do you know how insane
you sound?

54:28.961 --> 54:30.528
They don't even know each other.

54:30.571 --> 54:32.834
- It doesn't...
- And what evidence do you have?

54:32.878 --> 54:35.272
Why, James? Why?

54:35.315 --> 54:37.403
What possible reason would he
have to do something that...

54:37.404 --> 54:39.145
that's even
remotely plausible...

54:39.188 --> 54:41.321
Because I see the way
that he looks at you.

54:41.365 --> 54:42.975
I see what he is doing
to this family.

54:43.018 --> 54:44.193
What?

54:44.237 --> 54:45.543
I saw you.

54:47.588 --> 54:51.505
- In the nursery.
- You were watching us?

54:51.549 --> 54:54.291
I was using the nanny cam,
the one that you installed

54:54.334 --> 54:56.162
and I saw you kissing him.

55:00.122 --> 55:02.429
You don't get to be angry
about that.

55:02.473 --> 55:07.260
That was a mistake, and I did it
because I was shattered, James.

55:07.304 --> 55:09.610
Shattered after everything
you have done to me.

55:09.654 --> 55:11.395
Everything you have done
to this family.

55:11.438 --> 55:16.225
- How dare you!
- No. Owen, leave!

55:16.269 --> 55:18.967
No. James, you leave.

55:19.011 --> 55:20.404
Now!

55:22.319 --> 55:23.581
What?

55:26.018 --> 55:27.410
Man, you take one more step
closer to me

55:27.411 --> 55:28.934
I will put you in the hospital.

55:28.977 --> 55:30.892
Stop it.

55:30.936 --> 55:32.329
She told you to leave.

55:35.984 --> 55:38.335
Get out of our house.

55:41.990 --> 55:42.990
Okay.

55:44.297 --> 55:47.431
No, James! Get out!

55:47.474 --> 55:48.910
Stop!

55:56.091 --> 55:58.224
- Stop!
- Dad!

55:58.267 --> 56:00.922
911.
What's the nature of your emergency?

56:04.273 --> 56:05.873
H-hello, there's an intruder
at my house.

56:08.016 --> 56:09.757
Send someone as fast as you can.

56:18.462 --> 56:19.724
Police are on their way, James.

56:28.123 --> 56:29.473
Go get some ice.

56:30.865 --> 56:32.432
Don't move, don't move.

56:52.496 --> 56:53.888
I'm so sorry.

56:55.063 --> 56:56.413
It's okay.

56:57.805 --> 56:59.459
I've had worse.

57:01.940 --> 57:03.289
Thank you.

57:05.857 --> 57:10.644
You could've just
as easily let them arrest James.

57:10.688 --> 57:12.559
And then that would just
make you upset.

57:16.868 --> 57:19.131
Let me...

57:21.002 --> 57:22.177
Sorry.

57:23.265 --> 57:24.832
It's not your fault.

57:30.664 --> 57:33.101
I cannot believe James did this.

57:33.145 --> 57:34.581
I can.

57:36.104 --> 57:37.671
What?

57:37.715 --> 57:39.804
Based on what
I've seen lately.

57:44.025 --> 57:48.595
Plus, some women are
just worth fighting for.

57:55.950 --> 57:57.648
Whatever you doing?

58:01.086 --> 58:02.479
Owen.

58:03.523 --> 58:04.523
No.

58:09.616 --> 58:12.358
A guy stands up for you...

58:12.401 --> 58:14.491
and this is how he gets treated?

58:20.453 --> 58:23.630
I didn't, I didn't ask you
to fight my husband.

58:23.674 --> 58:25.632
That was the two of you
acting like children.

58:30.985 --> 58:33.118
Why are we dancing
around this, Lauren?

58:34.641 --> 58:36.643
We both know that we want this.

58:38.515 --> 58:40.212
You need to go home.

58:41.300 --> 58:42.693
Right now.

58:45.739 --> 58:48.437
Okay, I'm sorry.

58:48.481 --> 58:50.439
I'm woozy from the concussion
James gave me

58:50.483 --> 58:52.485
just let me-let me stay.

58:52.529 --> 58:54.835
Get out.

58:54.879 --> 58:58.578
We can talk when your head's
back on straight.

58:58.622 --> 58:59.622
Go.

59:02.103 --> 59:03.322
Fine.

59:04.410 --> 59:06.151
We'll talk tomorrow.

59:45.669 --> 59:47.061
The Manny?

59:47.105 --> 59:49.150
Okay, look, I know
I sound crazy

59:49.194 --> 59:50.717
but ever since he came
to our house...

59:50.761 --> 59:53.198
Do you have any proof?

59:53.241 --> 59:54.329
No.

59:54.373 --> 59:56.244
Okay, that's a great start.

59:56.288 --> 59:58.115
So, what am I supposed to do
with this information?

59:58.116 --> 01:00:00.074
I don't know, investigate?

01:00:00.118 --> 01:00:04.078
- Why would I be making this up?
- Well, I can think of a reason.

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:05.426
You're worried the medical
examiner's gonna come back

01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:07.429
and say "Summer didn't kill
herself."

01:00:07.473 --> 01:00:11.477
That the text she sent you,
doesn't make you look so good.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.610
Are you accusing me
of something?

01:00:13.653 --> 01:00:16.003
Not as long as
we leave this as a suicide.

01:00:16.047 --> 01:00:17.687
See, I like to have
some shred of evidence

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:19.572
before jumping to conclusions.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.922
Then again, between the picture
Summer texted you

01:00:21.966 --> 01:00:24.664
and the squad car that was sent
to your house last night...

01:00:26.013 --> 01:00:27.798
Don't look so surprised.

01:00:27.841 --> 01:00:29.669
A 911 call was placed to a house

01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:31.410
that's part of
an open investigation.

01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:34.108
You're lucky that kid
isn't pressing charges.

01:00:34.152 --> 01:00:36.110
He's lucky
that I didn't kill him.

01:00:36.154 --> 01:00:37.982
You should keep your mouth shut.

01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:40.941
You want my advice?

01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:44.205
Unless you've got
something to go on

01:00:44.249 --> 01:00:46.904
don't be so eager
to cry wolf.

01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:48.513
And you better pray
that examiner's report

01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:50.647
comes back clean.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:52.850
'Cause if there's even a hint
that there was a struggle

01:00:52.866 --> 01:00:54.694
well, our, our next talk...

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.043
won't be so pleasant.

01:01:01.614 --> 01:01:03.311
Okay, that was a good one.

01:01:03.355 --> 01:01:04.530
One more?

01:01:06.575 --> 01:01:08.490
Oh.

01:01:08.534 --> 01:01:10.362
Good job.

01:01:12.843 --> 01:01:14.148
Mom?

01:01:15.454 --> 01:01:16.760
Hey, sweetheart.

01:01:18.326 --> 01:01:19.719
You okay?

01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:21.460
No.

01:01:21.503 --> 01:01:24.202
Your dad...

01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:26.073
Honestly, I don't know
what he was thinkin'.

01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:28.815
It's not that.

01:01:30.643 --> 01:01:33.385
I don't care about Owen.

01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:35.735
I care about dad.

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.432
I care about us...

01:01:38.912 --> 01:01:40.697
being a normal family again.

01:01:41.872 --> 01:01:43.134
And, and I know

01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:45.136
it's not very likely.

01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:47.747
But, it's...

01:01:49.793 --> 01:01:52.926
it's less likely
with Owen still here.

01:01:58.149 --> 01:01:59.672
You don't need him, right?

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:02.283
I could do more chores

01:02:02.327 --> 01:02:04.721
help with Riley.

01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:06.200
Just whatever you need.

01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:07.462
Oh.

01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:16.689
You know
that you and your sister

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:19.257
are the most important things
in the world to me, right?

01:02:20.693 --> 01:02:21.955
And we are a family.

01:02:23.609 --> 01:02:25.263
And nothing is gonna come
between us.

01:02:28.614 --> 01:02:30.181
So, if you want me

01:02:30.224 --> 01:02:31.573
to fire Owen

01:02:31.617 --> 01:02:34.446
I will kick him out
on his butt.

01:02:34.489 --> 01:02:36.329
I don't think it's gonna
work with him, anyway.

01:05:35.409 --> 01:05:37.194
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:41.546
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:05:43.591 --> 01:05:45.985
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:47.900
It's okay.
This'll only take a moment.

01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:50.555
Shh.

01:05:50.598 --> 01:05:52.426
There we go.

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:53.558
There you go.

01:05:55.212 --> 01:05:57.301
Shh. I know you didn't mean
what you said.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:02.132
I know we both feel
the same way about each other.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:10.531
There're just
too many complications.

01:06:10.575 --> 01:06:13.230
Now I realize you're always
gonna put Carter before me.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.842
But deep down...

01:06:18.278 --> 01:06:20.237
Hey, can you move?
Stay with me.

01:06:22.543 --> 01:06:23.892
Deep down
I think we both know

01:06:23.936 --> 01:06:25.764
he doesn't really belong
in this family.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:30.290
Lauren...

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:34.381
You tried for eight years

01:06:34.425 --> 01:06:37.036
to have another baby.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.299
That's how badly
you wanted to replace him.

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:44.043
That's how much you wanted
to make it work.

01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:50.832
So, now I'm gonna do
what you can't...

01:06:52.965 --> 01:06:54.793
for the sake of this family.

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:06.299
Goodbye, Carter.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.509
Oh, what am I doing?

01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:19.981
Oh, my God.

01:11:15.662 --> 01:11:17.010
Hi,
it's Lauren, leave a message.

01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:18.404
Lauren...

01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:20.319
Lauren, please call me back.

01:11:20.363 --> 01:11:21.799
I need to know
that you're okay.

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:23.366
Okay? I'm at Owen's house.

01:11:23.409 --> 01:11:25.585
And, just...

01:11:25.629 --> 01:11:27.544
Please, call me back.

01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:31.983
James...

01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:42.385
James...

01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:46.519
I know you're in my house,
James.

01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:50.654
Sorry, I'm not there.

01:12:03.188 --> 01:12:04.929
Can you guess
where I am, James?

01:12:08.367 --> 01:12:10.717
Why don't you come inside

01:12:10.761 --> 01:12:12.197
and see for yourself?

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.668
Are you watching, James?

01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:34.671
Well, pay attention,
'cause this is very important.

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.239
This is my home

01:13:38.283 --> 01:13:40.459
and this is my family.

01:13:40.503 --> 01:13:42.635
And you are no longer
welcome here.

01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:45.899
If you go to the police

01:13:45.943 --> 01:13:48.293
if you try and stop me

01:13:48.336 --> 01:13:52.123
if you ever hurt
this family again...

01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:54.342
Why, you've seen
what I'm capable of.

01:13:54.386 --> 01:13:56.519
Goodbye, James.

01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:58.085
And don't worry

01:13:58.129 --> 01:14:00.348
I promise I'll take
really good care of 'em.

01:14:13.274 --> 01:14:15.146
No.

01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:17.148
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:43.348 --> 01:14:45.089
- This is Schneider.
- Detective.

01:14:45.132 --> 01:14:46.960
- This is James.
- Where the hell are you?

01:14:47.004 --> 01:14:48.527
I'm at Owen Leary's house.

01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:50.268
You said
you needed evidence, right?

01:14:50.311 --> 01:14:51.530
The bastard killed his mother!

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:53.053
James, stop.

01:14:53.097 --> 01:14:54.794
Summer was strangled
before she was hanged.

01:14:54.838 --> 01:14:55.752
The examiner's report
came back in.

01:14:55.795 --> 01:14:58.276
I knew he did it.

01:14:58.319 --> 01:15:00.233
This will be a lot easier
if you turned yourself in, the longer...

01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:02.323
Like I said,
I'm at Owen Leary's house.

01:15:02.367 --> 01:15:03.890
- Come and get me!
- What? James?

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:22.822
It's okay, I've got you.

01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:26.565
Mommy will be awake soon.

01:15:37.228 --> 01:15:38.534
Owen.

01:15:40.971 --> 01:15:42.407
Owen, give me Riley.

01:15:45.062 --> 01:15:46.716
We need to talk first.

01:15:47.717 --> 01:15:49.588
Okay.

01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:51.547
Let's talk.

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.026
Please, give me my baby.

01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:54.375
Our baby.

01:15:54.419 --> 01:15:56.203
She's our baby now.

01:15:56.247 --> 01:15:57.640
Okay...

01:15:57.683 --> 01:15:59.119
our baby.

01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:00.773
Give me our baby.

01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:04.603
Oh.

01:16:09.042 --> 01:16:11.218
We-we can talk downstairs.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:16.310
What a good idea.

01:16:16.354 --> 01:16:17.921
Hey, Carter.

01:16:17.964 --> 01:16:19.662
Wake up!

01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:21.054
Carter, wake up!

01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:23.361
Owen?

01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:33.458
Let's have a family meeting.

01:16:40.857 --> 01:16:42.685
[tires screech

01:17:01.878 --> 01:17:03.183
Lauren?

01:17:05.055 --> 01:17:06.404
In the living room.

01:17:13.106 --> 01:17:14.978
James...

01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:16.806
I told you...

01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:18.634
what will happen
if you interfere.

01:17:21.593 --> 01:17:23.900
Owen, I didn't call
the police, it's just me.

01:17:26.076 --> 01:17:27.686
I just wanna talk.

01:17:30.123 --> 01:17:31.647
Great.

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:33.387
Please join us then.

01:17:37.261 --> 01:17:38.610
Come on.

01:17:49.142 --> 01:17:50.709
You know, I think
it's very important

01:17:50.753 --> 01:17:54.060
that, uh, we all...

01:17:54.104 --> 01:17:56.193
understand
the family dynamic now.

01:17:58.195 --> 01:18:01.372
This is what I propose, James.

01:18:01.415 --> 01:18:04.505
You leave, and get out
of our lives forever

01:18:04.549 --> 01:18:06.725
so Lauren and me
can start our family now.

01:18:06.769 --> 01:18:09.075
You're insane.

01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:11.295
That's what my mother said.

01:18:11.338 --> 01:18:13.098
She didn't think
we belonged together either.

01:18:14.428 --> 01:18:16.039
But I'm not insane.

01:18:16.082 --> 01:18:18.302
I'm just committed,
unlike some people.

01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:23.133
Lauren, I will never leave you.

01:18:23.176 --> 01:18:24.351
Okay?

01:18:27.137 --> 01:18:28.616
You stay!

01:18:34.231 --> 01:18:36.842
I'll always love you like I have
for the last 20 years.

01:18:36.886 --> 01:18:38.844
You don't love me.

01:18:38.888 --> 01:18:40.759
Oh, yes, I do,
and you love me.

01:18:40.803 --> 01:18:42.718
Now, don't pretend
like you don't.

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:46.199
And I know
how much you love our baby.

01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:49.210
What the hell's the matter
with you?

01:18:52.075 --> 01:18:53.859
What's the matter
with you, James?

01:18:56.166 --> 01:18:58.734
You had everything.
You had the perfect wife.

01:18:58.777 --> 01:19:00.300
You had the perfect house

01:19:00.344 --> 01:19:01.823
perfect children,
and you threw it all away

01:19:01.824 --> 01:19:02.825
because it got hard.

01:19:02.868 --> 01:19:03.826
Because of some girl?

01:19:03.869 --> 01:19:05.305
- What...
- Shut up!

01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:07.568
Shut up!

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.268
I'm gonna fix what you broke.

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:14.097
And I'm gonna give you
a chance

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:15.446
to make it right.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:17.970
How?

01:19:19.667 --> 01:19:22.192
You're gonna get down
on your knees

01:19:22.235 --> 01:19:25.108
and you're gonna beg
for forgiveness, for mercy

01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:26.457
before I kill you.

01:19:27.023 --> 01:19:28.023
No.

01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:30.896
And if you don't

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:33.725
I may have to turn my attention
to someone else here.

01:19:35.858 --> 01:19:37.816
You wouldn't hurt them.

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.060
Maybe, you're right.

01:19:39.078 --> 01:19:41.559
I would never hurt
Lauren or Riley.

01:19:41.602 --> 01:19:45.041
But, uh,
if I'm being honest, James

01:19:45.084 --> 01:19:47.478
I never cared for Carter.

01:19:50.002 --> 01:19:51.003
- Mom...
- No, Owen...

01:19:51.047 --> 01:19:52.265
No! No!

01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:55.834
Owen, please.
Owen, please.

01:19:59.011 --> 01:20:01.144
So, what's it gonna be, James?

01:20:01.187 --> 01:20:03.799
Will you actually do something
to help this family?

01:20:03.842 --> 01:20:06.192
- Dad...
- Okay.

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.153
James, no.

01:20:13.547 --> 01:20:15.375
Owen, Owen, let them go.

01:20:15.419 --> 01:20:16.768
I-I'm the one you want.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.075
He's done hurting you,
this ends now.

01:20:23.035 --> 01:20:24.428
Do it!

01:20:31.348 --> 01:20:33.045
Lauren, I love you

01:20:33.089 --> 01:20:34.481
and I'm sorry.

01:20:36.005 --> 01:20:38.485
Carter, I want you
to watch out

01:20:38.529 --> 01:20:40.661
for your mom
and your little sister, okay?

01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:44.883
I guess that'll do.

01:20:54.458 --> 01:20:56.939
Goodbye, James.

01:20:56.982 --> 01:20:59.332
I'm really not gonna
miss you.

01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:03.902
Carter. Go, run!

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:13.912
Oh...

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:18.090
Lauren, get out of here.

01:21:18.134 --> 01:21:20.005
Ah...

01:21:26.403 --> 01:21:27.403
No!

01:21:49.382 --> 01:21:50.775
Carter?

01:21:51.994 --> 01:21:53.734
Lauren?

01:22:02.874 --> 01:22:04.267
Lauren?

01:22:46.352 --> 01:22:47.614
Where's Riley?

01:22:52.054 --> 01:22:53.707
Where's our baby?

01:22:57.233 --> 01:22:59.017
She's in our room.

01:23:01.324 --> 01:23:03.500
"Our room?"

01:23:47.892 --> 01:23:50.025
Are you sure this is right?

01:23:55.117 --> 01:23:58.642
Kiddo, I'm an engineer,
I'm pretty sure I know

01:23:58.685 --> 01:24:01.297
how to put some
Swedish furniture together.

01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:06.606
Now, is this piece A
or piece G?

01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:08.173
Dad, it's backwards.

01:24:09.174 --> 01:24:10.219
I knew that.

01:24:11.916 --> 01:24:14.397
I'm gettin'
the instruction manual.

01:24:16.834 --> 01:24:19.706
Thanks. Dad's staying
for dinner, right?

01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:21.056
Sure.

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.106
Think it'll get done today?

01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:30.717
I told you I'd build it.

01:24:30.761 --> 01:24:32.161
So, you have nothin'
to worry about.

01:24:34.852 --> 01:24:36.158
Let me see that.

01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:40.162
Oh.

01:24:40.205 --> 01:24:41.641
Hey, Megan.

01:24:43.513 --> 01:24:45.689
- How are you?
- Hey, Lauren.

01:24:45.732 --> 01:24:47.125
I just saw the story
on the news.

01:24:47.169 --> 01:24:49.301
- Is everything okay?
- Everyone's fine.

01:24:49.345 --> 01:24:51.564
We've just been readjusting
the last couple days.

01:24:51.608 --> 01:24:54.089
Everything's looking good.

01:24:54.132 --> 01:24:56.134
Remember at
lunch the other day?

01:24:56.178 --> 01:24:59.137
Now I know where I recognized
Owen from.

01:24:59.181 --> 01:25:01.444
Lauren, he-he used to work
at the clinic.

01:25:01.487 --> 01:25:03.402
What?

01:25:03.446 --> 01:25:05.230
Yeah, he was
a medical assistant.

01:25:05.274 --> 01:25:06.623
But he got fired
after he tampered

01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:08.799
with some of the records.

01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:10.931
I know whose files he accessed.

01:25:10.975 --> 01:25:13.369
I'm, I'm not certain, but...

01:25:13.412 --> 01:25:16.067
I think he might have
switched out James' sample.
