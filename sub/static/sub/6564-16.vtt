00:09.460 --> 00:11.720
Oh, I am so into this book,

00:11.930 --> 00:13.570
Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.

00:13.710 --> 00:14.630
You have to read it.

00:14.780 --> 00:17.180
No, thank you. I don't have to read some book

00:17.320 --> 00:18.710
to know prejudice is wrong.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.350
It's not about prejudice.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.980
It's about romance in the early 19th century.

00:25.170 --> 00:26.940
They wrote the most poetic letters

00:27.070 --> 00:28.500
to express their feelings back then.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.550
Now you're lucky if you get a text that says,

00:31.560 --> 00:32.619
"You're hot. Smiley face."

00:33.590 --> 00:36.790
You got a text that says, "You're hot. Smiley face." From who?

00:38.710 --> 00:41.700
Ooh! My dad is calling on usFace.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.880
Hi, Daddy!

00:44.210 --> 00:46.020
Hey, Pumpkin! I figured out usFace!

00:46.240 --> 00:47.530
You did! That's so great!

00:47.730 --> 00:50.040
I can't hear you. Pumpkin?

00:50.230 --> 00:52.380
Maybe I didn't figure out usFace.

00:52.700 --> 00:54.570
Dad, turn up the volume.

00:54.970 --> 00:57.260
Yeah, I can see your lips move, but I can't hear...

00:57.430 --> 00:58.420
Oh, hold on, I'm getting a text.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.050
Oh, it's from you.

01:00.180 --> 01:02.480
"Turn up the volume."

01:02.680 --> 01:06.500
Oh! Oh! Hey, Pumpkin!

01:06.670 --> 01:09.870
Hi, Daddy! Rocky's here. Rocky, say, "Hi" to Daddy.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.360
Hi, Daddy.

01:11.510 --> 01:13.810
I got a surprise for you, CeCe.

01:13.980 --> 01:15.470
Is it something I can wear?

01:15.830 --> 01:17.210
Better.

01:17.430 --> 01:19.730
Hang on. I gotta get the door.

01:22.810 --> 01:25.620
Oh, hey, Dad. Dad, I gotta go. You're here.

01:34.340 --> 01:37.850
Everybody, everybody,get out on the floor

01:38.020 --> 01:41.340
It can get a little crazy when the kick hits the 4

01:41.520 --> 01:45.010
Make a scene, make a scene, nobody can ignore

01:45.300 --> 01:49.100
Don't knock it We can't take it no more

01:49.600 --> 01:52.750
Bring the lights up, bust the doors down

01:53.030 --> 01:56.180
Dust yourself off  Shake it up, shake it up

01:56.580 --> 02:00.240
DJ set it off,take it up a notch

02:00.650 --> 02:03.980
All together now,shake it up, shake it up

02:05.010 --> 02:08.440
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up  You got to change it up

02:08.759 --> 02:12.370
And when you've had enough  Sh-sh-sh-shake it up

02:12.540 --> 02:15.320
Bring the lights up,bust the doors down

02:15.540 --> 02:18.510
All together now,shake it up, shake it up

02:21.620 --> 02:23.380
Shake it up

02:23.380 --> 02:25.360
Shake It Up!  S02E16  Parent Trap It Up

02:28.450 --> 02:30.850
And when you guys come to Florida to visit for Spring Break,

02:31.090 --> 02:33.010
we're going to Coaster Kingdom.

02:33.430 --> 02:34.760
I love Coaster Kingdom.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.310
A roller coaster actually takes from the parking lot

02:37.480 --> 02:39.280
to the roller coasters!

02:39.740 --> 02:44.040
They just added a new coaster, called "The Vomit Comet."

02:44.260 --> 02:45.930
There's a loop-de-loop...

02:46.200 --> 02:47.580
Whoa! Whoa!

02:47.740 --> 02:48.880
...and an 80-story drop

02:50.170 --> 02:51.670
into a corkscrew!

02:52.880 --> 02:56.490
The handles actually have built-in barf bag dispensers.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.860
Oh, I can't wait!

02:58.130 --> 03:00.560
And I can't wait to wait in the gift shop!

03:03.510 --> 03:05.960
"Crusty's Pizza and Italian Food."

03:06.220 --> 03:08.680
Ooh, I wonder if they have wonton soup.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.240
They don't. I've asked.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.320
Wow, I love when we're all together.

03:13.530 --> 03:15.030
It makes me feel so smart.

03:15.490 --> 03:17.250
- Mmm. What do you mean?  - What do you mean?

03:17.440 --> 03:19.450
I'll explain it later.

03:23.280 --> 03:27.310
Okay. So I guess today was the day the romance died.

03:29.290 --> 03:31.890
Sorry, I'm just a little nervous, you know.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.800
Ty really likes this girl and I really want this double date to go well.

03:36.010 --> 03:37.340
Like I don't?

03:37.500 --> 03:39.400
I'd love someone I can have girl-talk with

03:39.530 --> 03:41.040
while you and Ty talk about

03:41.240 --> 03:43.070
whatever it is I pretend to listen to

03:43.280 --> 03:46.170
but I'm actually ignoring while playing Cranky Chickens on my phone.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.920
Hey, guys! I want you to meet...

03:50.090 --> 03:52.180
Gina DiPasquale?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.340
Hey, that's right. Good guess!

03:54.510 --> 03:56.300
Hello, Dina.

03:56.780 --> 03:58.330
Wait. You two know each other?

03:58.500 --> 04:01.370
Yeah, we were in Rainbow Girls together when we were nine.

04:01.590 --> 04:04.550
But enough of my bad childhood memories.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.400
You know, that's funny. My sister Rocky was a Rainbow...

04:08.600 --> 04:13.070
Poor Dina finished second  in cookie sales and didn't win the bicycle.

04:13.530 --> 04:14.470
Who won again?

04:14.720 --> 04:16.740
Oh, yeah, me.

04:17.140 --> 04:19.610
And who cried about it like a little baby?

04:19.750 --> 04:21.430
Oh, yeah. You.

04:21.930 --> 04:24.940
Well, I would've won if your father hadn't bought all the cookies

04:25.100 --> 04:26.650
and let you eat them yourself.

04:26.960 --> 04:27.890
Come on, girls. Chill out.

04:28.130 --> 04:30.760
Yeah, we're supposed to be hanging out, having a good time.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.210
I'm sorry. You're right.

04:40.350 --> 04:43.450
I say enough with this competition stuff.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.450
Now we're talking.

04:44.650 --> 04:46.260
Yeah. So, what do you say we order something to eat?

04:46.410 --> 04:48.430
I'm so hungry. I could eat a whole pizza by myself!

04:48.590 --> 04:49.690
I could eat two!

04:54.120 --> 04:57.380
What? No, no, no, no, no, J.J. No.

04:57.690 --> 05:02.380
I think we all know that CeCe got her dancing talent from me.

05:06.510 --> 05:07.330
Mmm-mmm!

05:07.950 --> 05:12.510
Oh, yeah? Well, what do you call this?

05:13.960 --> 05:15.540
Embarrassing?

05:15.720 --> 05:17.490
Yeah, that was bad, wasn't it?

05:17.680 --> 05:19.040
Hey, remember this one?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.630
Wow, you still have some moves.

05:24.870 --> 05:26.660
I'm hoping one of them is getting me back up.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.140
Thanks for coffee.

05:30.510 --> 05:31.450
It was great to see you.

05:31.630 --> 05:32.300
Good to see you.

05:32.490 --> 05:33.580
Goodbye, you two.

05:33.790 --> 05:35.230
CeCe, I'll see you tomorrow after school.

05:35.370 --> 05:36.740
- Good night, Dad.  - Good night, Dad.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.670
Yes?

05:44.850 --> 05:45.610
Your parents.

05:45.820 --> 05:49.590
They were getting all PG-13.

05:51.420 --> 05:52.200
You're crazy.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.730
Come on, you've got to admit, they got along really well,

05:55.900 --> 05:57.210
considering that they're divorced.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.660
Actually, they get along really well because they're divorced.

06:01.820 --> 06:05.880
I don't know. It just seemed like there was a spark there.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.290
The way they were dancing and laughing.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.470
It was just like the book.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.250
A smoldering ember that time apart cannot extinguish.

06:14.410 --> 06:16.960
See? This is why I don't read.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.590
It just messes with your grasp of reality.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.050
Yeah. That's why you don't read.

06:24.740 --> 06:25.470
I'm just saying,

06:25.650 --> 06:29.680
how romantic would it be if the two of them actually got back together?

06:30.270 --> 06:33.850
Okay, I think you need a little reality check.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.520
Flynn! Why don't you get in here!

06:42.200 --> 06:44.410
Rocky thinks Mom and Dad should get back together.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.910
Would you mind?

06:48.220 --> 06:49.390
Have a seat, Rocky.

06:51.650 --> 06:56.320
Mom and Dad do love each other, and they love us.

06:56.690 --> 06:58.630
They just don't love living together.

06:58.970 --> 07:01.400
And it's better to have two happy houses

07:01.660 --> 07:04.030
than one house that's not so happy.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.170
Plus, Dad lives in Florida,

07:07.320 --> 07:09.540
home to many, many, many, many, many theme parks.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.240
Did I mention he also gets a little competitive with Mom

07:12.390 --> 07:13.940
when it comes to birthday presents?

07:14.550 --> 07:15.770
It's all good.

07:17.940 --> 07:19.510
So, you feel any better, Rocky?

07:19.640 --> 07:22.790
You know what? I totally get it now.

07:23.030 --> 07:25.850
You two don't understand a thing about romance.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.540
Oh!

07:28.990 --> 07:30.630
Look at that.

07:30.790 --> 07:31.830
There's two doves out here.

07:32.140 --> 07:33.220
They mate for life you know!

07:34.350 --> 07:36.330
They also poop in public. What's your point?

07:44.750 --> 07:46.250
- Dude. - Dude.  - I mean...

07:46.360 --> 07:47.200
I know, Gina was all...

07:47.330 --> 07:48.790
- And Dina was all like... - No doubt. So, I guess...

07:48.920 --> 07:49.890
I don't see any other way.

07:49.990 --> 07:50.840
- All right then. - Cool.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.610
Wait, wait. We just agreed not to double date again, right?

07:55.860 --> 07:58.640
Oh, good. I thought we weren't going to be friends anymore.

07:58.760 --> 07:59.760
This is better. I like this.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.550
What?

08:00.670 --> 08:04.150
Oh, no! Lydia and Mr. Wickham have run away together.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.660
Uh-huh.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.630
So, that's airfare for two

08:09.870 --> 08:12.400
and hotel in Hawaii for that price?

08:12.640 --> 08:15.300
Oh, she is going to love this.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.080
She's always wanted to go to Hawaii.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.560
Uh-huh. Yeah. Hold on. Let me write this down.

08:21.420 --> 08:22.500
What did I do with my...

08:24.080 --> 08:25.800
You know what? I don't have a pen.

08:26.530 --> 08:27.720
Just tell me. I'll remember.

08:29.180 --> 08:30.010
Did you hear that?

08:30.320 --> 08:32.640
Airfare for two to Hawaii? Don't you get it?

08:32.870 --> 08:34.270
Oh, my gondola!

08:34.789 --> 08:37.620
My dad's taking me to Hawaii and Flynn doesn't get to go!

08:37.919 --> 08:39.720
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

08:39.860 --> 08:40.830
What, what, what?

08:40.980 --> 08:42.030
Or...

08:42.789 --> 08:43.620
I was right,

08:43.799 --> 08:45.460
and your dad still have feelings for your mom,

08:45.600 --> 08:47.540
and he's here to whisk her off on a romantic getaway.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.780
He is wooing her.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.000
Just like when Fitzwilliam Darcy wooed Elizabeth.

08:51.140 --> 08:52.270
And I'm just like Charlotte,

08:52.390 --> 08:54.960
Elizabeth's pragmatic friend, sensible and always right!

08:56.080 --> 08:58.180
This is exactly like the book.

08:58.420 --> 09:01.220
No, you're exactly like the book.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.070
Boring.

09:07.290 --> 09:08.710
I win again!

09:08.920 --> 09:12.740
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were letting me win.

09:13.210 --> 09:16.250
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were cheating.

09:16.560 --> 09:19.200
You know what we do to cheaters around these parts.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.170
Help! Mom! Police!

09:23.630 --> 09:26.510
Sorry, kiddo. Even the law can't help you now.

09:26.680 --> 09:28.670
But I'm innocent! Innocent, I tell you!

09:30.690 --> 09:32.670
Oh, how did those get in there?

09:35.890 --> 09:38.620
Look at that. One big happy family.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.820
What's that expression? Oh, yes.

09:40.970 --> 09:43.570
"A family that plays together stays together."

09:43.800 --> 09:47.060
Oh, I know another expression. "You're delusional."

09:47.300 --> 09:49.120
Okay, bedtime.

09:49.390 --> 09:51.950
- But Mom... - No. Not you, me.  I'm exhausted.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.110
But now that you mention it, you too.

09:54.390 --> 09:55.510
Yeah. I've got to go anyway, buddy.

09:55.690 --> 09:56.870
All right. Night, Dad. Good night.

09:57.020 --> 09:58.050
Good night, buddy.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.120
Good night, Rocky. I'll see you tomorrow, Pumpkin.

10:01.230 --> 10:02.300
Okay. Good night, Daddy.

10:08.020 --> 10:10.000
Oh! My dad left his jacket.

10:20.290 --> 10:22.810
Rocky, you were wrong.

10:23.260 --> 10:25.750
My dad is not here to woo back my mom.

10:26.050 --> 10:29.180
He's here to propose to her!

10:29.440 --> 10:30.820
Oh, my gondola!

10:38.210 --> 10:41.640
Wow! I can't believe my dad is going to propose to my mom.

10:41.800 --> 10:45.000
Why, Mr. Darcy, this is so sudden, but...

10:45.180 --> 10:48.370
Yes, I will marry you!

10:52.330 --> 10:55.050
CeCe, it's me. I forgot my jacket.

10:55.260 --> 10:56.860
- Rocky! Take it off! - I can't!

10:57.050 --> 10:58.390
It's stuck!

11:02.000 --> 11:03.730
Who is it?

11:04.660 --> 11:05.350
Still me.

11:06.470 --> 11:08.350
Um, be right with you!

11:08.580 --> 11:11.510
We're just in the middle of dance rehearsal.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.390
And a five, six, seven, eight!

11:14.630 --> 11:15.670
Ow! Ow!

11:16.490 --> 11:18.410
Go, go. Hide! Go, go.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.140
Daddy, you're back!

11:24.870 --> 11:25.960
Yeah, I forgot my jacket.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.470
Dad, as long as you're here, I want to hang out with you.

11:29.840 --> 11:32.220
I just want to spend every minute with you.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.890
- Well, I guess I could stay for a while.  - Got it!

11:35.540 --> 11:36.380
I'm tired. You should go.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.150
Keep it real, Mr. Jones.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.490
I bet your mom will let us be bridesmaids!

11:46.720 --> 11:48.370
Isn't this the most exciting, amazing thing ever?

11:48.780 --> 11:49.540
Shh!

11:53.390 --> 11:56.070
I don't know. I never really thought they'd get back together.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.770
It doesn't even really matter to me.

11:58.030 --> 11:59.560
Doesn't matter? Doesn't matter!

11:59.710 --> 12:01.820
Girls, be quiet.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.350
This is a library.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.130
People don't come here to talk.

12:05.430 --> 12:07.920
They come here to take naps and avoid the Vice Principal.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.560
Sorry, Miss Burke. I just got a little excited.

12:11.890 --> 12:14.190
CeCe's dad is going to propose to her mom.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.310
Propose?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.130
Is there a ring?

12:21.280 --> 12:23.380
Yeah, we found it last night.

12:23.770 --> 12:25.940
Oh! I've always wanted to get engaged.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.580
Sometimes when I'm bored,

12:27.800 --> 12:30.380
look, I draw a ring on my finger.

12:32.010 --> 12:33.750
This one is princess cut,

12:34.300 --> 12:36.470
and this one is emerald cut.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.660
And I can't decide which one I like best.

12:41.300 --> 12:42.770
- Emerald cut. - Emerald cut.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.860
I always go back to emerald cut, too!

12:46.900 --> 12:48.500
Shh!

12:48.900 --> 12:50.200
Don't you shush me!

12:50.830 --> 12:51.820
We're talking about love!

12:54.370 --> 12:56.670
Your mom must be so excited.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.670
Actually, I don't even know if she wants to get married again.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.870
Oh, no. What if your dad asks her and she says no?

13:05.030 --> 13:06.740
I'd feel terrible for him.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.140
We just have to get her in the right frame of mind.

13:09.460 --> 13:10.660
We need a plan.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.630
- We?  - We?

13:14.770 --> 13:15.820
Yeah, we.

13:16.660 --> 13:18.210
You think I'm going to leave something as important as this

13:18.330 --> 13:19.410
up to the two of you?

13:21.130 --> 13:23.270
Now, what did they do on their first date?

13:24.710 --> 13:26.760
I think they went out for Indian food.

13:27.190 --> 13:28.340
Bollywood!

13:28.930 --> 13:29.910
Shh!

13:30.210 --> 13:31.200
Can it!

13:32.600 --> 13:35.790
Bollywood is all about colorful saris,

13:36.090 --> 13:39.580
and spicy food, and exotic music and dancing.

13:44.500 --> 13:49.480
Recreate that, and I guarantee your mom will say, "Yes. Yes!

13:50.820 --> 13:51.570
"Yes."

13:54.030 --> 13:56.880
You know, Miss Burke, you are a true romantic.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.570
You know, I bet, if you took off those glasses

13:58.750 --> 14:01.390
and lost the pencils in your hair, and did your makeup...

14:01.590 --> 14:03.250
Well, um, not like that,

14:05.840 --> 14:08.260
you, you would look just like a model.

14:09.350 --> 14:10.340
A model?

14:11.890 --> 14:14.410
Stop, you.

14:15.290 --> 14:16.400
Hardly.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.120
Shh!

14:33.560 --> 14:36.570
- Oh, hey, Ty. - Hey, Gina.

14:36.890 --> 14:37.810
Oh, no.

14:38.030 --> 14:40.170
Oops. We should go.

14:40.490 --> 14:41.930
What is it with you two?

14:42.300 --> 14:44.400
Well, we just thought it would be best to keep

14:44.530 --> 14:45.570
a little distance between you.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.910
Yeah, like Lake Michigan.

14:49.050 --> 14:51.950
Oh, that's just silly. We can get through one night.

14:52.190 --> 14:53.690
I mean, I know I can.

14:53.930 --> 14:55.460
I don't know about Gina.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.970
I can get along with you better than you can get along with me.

15:00.450 --> 15:01.530
Would you two stop it?

15:01.760 --> 15:02.910
Yeah, enough is enough.

15:03.210 --> 15:05.570
Okay, we'll stop competing with each other.

15:05.890 --> 15:06.540
Agreed.

15:09.580 --> 15:10.350
That guy's good.

15:12.260 --> 15:14.510
I bet Ty could stay on that mechanical bull

15:14.650 --> 15:16.990
a lot longer than your lox a boyfriend.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.160
You're on. Ty's got legs like a flamingo.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.850
Did you see Deuce's thighs?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.850
He could crush a watermelon with those.

15:27.590 --> 15:30.410
Oh, I'm so glad we've worked it all out.

15:33.870 --> 15:34.550
CeCe?

15:35.130 --> 15:36.540
-CeCe?  -CeCe?

15:37.300 --> 15:39.140
Hey, what are you doing here?

15:39.530 --> 15:40.400
What are you doing here?

15:40.750 --> 15:41.940
What am I doing here?

15:43.190 --> 15:44.990
Oh, CeCe told me to pick her up.

15:45.330 --> 15:47.170
No, CeCe told me to pick her up.

15:47.350 --> 15:49.150
No, no, no. She told me to pick her up.

15:49.390 --> 15:50.150
No...

15:50.480 --> 15:51.900
No! She told both of you to pick her up.

15:52.190 --> 15:53.960
Oh, that's CeCe, so playful,

15:54.120 --> 15:56.090
like the monkey god of the Ganges River.

15:57.870 --> 15:59.800
Flynn, what is going on?

15:59.980 --> 16:03.360
I'm not Flynn. I'm Samir, from India.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.690
Let me show you to your table.

16:12.300 --> 16:16.100
Anywho, welcome to the Taj Mahal Restaurant,

16:16.250 --> 16:18.320
where our food is the eighth wonder of the world.

16:18.550 --> 16:20.290
You will wonder where it came from,

16:20.400 --> 16:22.880
because there is no kitchen here.

16:24.260 --> 16:25.500
I love Indian food.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.840
Ooh! I wonder if they serve wonton soup.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.290
What?

16:31.610 --> 16:33.090
Allow me to tell you our specials.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.650
Actually, I'd prefer an explanation for what's going on.

16:37.060 --> 16:39.720
Oh, I'm sorry,we are fresh out of explanations.

16:40.430 --> 16:43.990
But we do have a very nice chicken tikka masala.

16:48.850 --> 16:52.730
Dina, baby, uh, about me and the mechanical bull...

16:52.880 --> 16:53.970
Yeah, I can't.

16:54.210 --> 16:55.650
Sure you can.

16:55.850 --> 16:56.880
No, no, no. I can't.

16:57.990 --> 17:01.130
When I was five, my mom put me on one of those

17:01.270 --> 17:04.160
coin-operated pony rides, and I cried for a week.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.680
Oh, baby,

17:06.960 --> 17:11.700
I had no idea you suffered through a horrible childhood trauma like that.

17:12.210 --> 17:13.260
Now, buck up!

17:20.359 --> 17:22.859
Yeah, that's right! Check me out!

17:23.119 --> 17:24.380
Yeah!

17:26.339 --> 17:27.270
Ooh!

17:27.990 --> 17:29.380
Yeah!

17:31.380 --> 17:33.690
Yeah! Top that, Dina!

17:33.950 --> 17:35.720
Oh, don't worry. I will!

17:41.380 --> 17:44.180
Deuce, get up there.

17:45.090 --> 17:45.900
It won't be so bad.

17:52.190 --> 17:53.990
- Now ride.  - Okay.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.640
I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah!

18:25.170 --> 18:26.360
We win!

18:27.710 --> 18:28.370
Did we?

18:28.790 --> 18:30.740
Look at me, Dina! I've got no pants!

18:36.800 --> 18:39.000
You two. I mean, you...

18:39.220 --> 18:40.350
Ugh!

18:41.590 --> 18:44.160
Deuce, buddy, I got your pants.

18:48.730 --> 18:51.350
Deuce can get so emotional sometimes.

18:51.670 --> 18:53.150
Tell me about it.

18:53.330 --> 18:55.850
The other day, Ty cried at a greeting card commercial.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.940
Want to get some frozen yogurt?

19:00.450 --> 19:02.310
Love to. My treat.

19:02.690 --> 19:03.850
No, my treat.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.140
No, my treat.

19:05.350 --> 19:06.150
Okay.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.260
Huh?

19:10.810 --> 19:12.980
He's right, this chicken is great. Mmm-hmm.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.810
And hot!

19:16.870 --> 19:20.020
That's exactly what you did the first time we had Indian food.

19:21.700 --> 19:22.820
Oh, wait.

19:23.260 --> 19:26.440
Now I get it. They're trying to recreate our first date.

19:26.870 --> 19:27.750
What? No.

19:27.990 --> 19:29.200
Our first date was pizza.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.230
If our first date was pizza, we never would've had a second date.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.240
Flynn? Flynn!

19:36.300 --> 19:37.660
Samir!

19:41.290 --> 19:44.060
Yes, ma'am? Is everything to your liking?

19:44.420 --> 19:47.280
Actually, what I would like is for your sister to come out here.

19:47.750 --> 19:48.660
Now.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.900
I'm sure she'd love to, but the floor show is about to start!

20:57.110 --> 20:59.060
Let's hear it for the hottest dancers in town!

20:59.230 --> 21:00.770
Hotter than the curry, no?

21:00.980 --> 21:01.710
No.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.330
Girls, that was lovely.

21:04.750 --> 21:07.120
And very entertaining. But one little question.

21:07.420 --> 21:07.940
Why?

21:08.300 --> 21:11.770
Ooh, I love the way they finish each other's sentences.

21:13.260 --> 21:13.950
CeCe?

21:14.270 --> 21:17.610
Well, if I told you, I would ruin Dad's surprise.

21:18.990 --> 21:20.440
So, go ahead, Dad.

21:20.810 --> 21:24.030
Oh. Wait! Wait! Wait! Let me get out my camera.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.550
Okay, go ahead, Mr. Darcy.

21:27.930 --> 21:30.570
I mean, Mr. Jones.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.340
My surprise? Yes, my surprise.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.850
My surprise is...

21:38.900 --> 21:40.230
Must be a really big surprise,

21:40.340 --> 21:41.670
because I don't even know what it is.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.420
We found the ring!

21:44.800 --> 21:46.010
Dad is going to propose!

21:46.340 --> 21:47.010
Ah! Whoo!

21:47.450 --> 21:49.580
What? Oh, that's ridiculous.

21:49.900 --> 21:50.700
He is not.

21:50.930 --> 21:52.620
Actually, I am going to propose.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.150
But not to you, Georgia. To Cathy.

21:56.420 --> 21:57.980
Oh, thank heaven!

21:58.300 --> 22:00.410
I mean, congratulations.

22:00.750 --> 22:05.240
So who would have thought that Dad proposing to Mom was insane?

22:05.420 --> 22:06.690
Oh, that's right. Me.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.810
Wait! No, no, no, no. This is not how the book ends!

22:12.240 --> 22:13.750
And who the heck is Cathy?

22:15.960 --> 22:18.030
Cathy is Dad's girlfriend in Florida.

22:19.340 --> 22:21.080
I didn't know you guys were so serious.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.420
She's really great, Rocky.

22:23.700 --> 22:26.890
Yeah. She likes baseball, chili-burgers and 3-D alien movies.

22:27.110 --> 22:29.460
If Dad wasn't marrying her, I think I might have to.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.230
Just one second.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.830
Really? You couldn't have mentioned he had a girlfriend?

22:38.140 --> 22:40.310
Yeah, because this is all my fault.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.030
Look, I'm really sorry, CeCe.

22:43.180 --> 22:44.820
I was wrong about this whole thing.

22:44.970 --> 22:46.680
I just hope you're not too disappointed.

22:47.570 --> 22:50.200
No, not at all. I'm totally fine with this.

22:51.050 --> 22:53.450
I just don't know how we're going to break it to the librarian.

22:55.170 --> 22:57.760
Well, chances are, you'll never be in the library again,

22:57.900 --> 22:58.870
so it shouldn't be a problem.

23:03.520 --> 23:07.270
Now, remember, sweetie, it's all about facing your fears.

23:07.890 --> 23:09.470
You can do this.

23:10.290 --> 23:12.810
Okay.

23:14.540 --> 23:16.270
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

23:16.420 --> 23:17.380
all by myself and with no glue

23:19.470 --> 23:21.390
Yes, you are, baby!

23:27.220 --> 23:29.230
again, again, again, again!
