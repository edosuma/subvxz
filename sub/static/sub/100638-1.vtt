Gilda:

12:43.110 --> 12:46.374
The whistling
language is a code, like Morse.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.769
Everything we speak
can be whistled.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.641
And if the police
hear the language,

12:53.163 --> 12:55.949
they will think
the birds are singing.

12:56.688 --> 12:59.126
For example, my name, Kiko.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.275
Let's whistle!

13:20.974 --> 13:24.760
Put your finger like this,
like you have a gun,

13:25.108 --> 13:26.544
and put it in your mouth.

13:27.719 --> 13:30.200
The angle must be this.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.638
Like the bullet will come
out through your ear.

13:38.992 --> 13:39.993
Kiko:

13:45.999 --> 13:47.827
The lips. Lips.

13:48.131 --> 13:51.787
A little more inside, like
an old man with no teeth, hmm?

13:59.577 --> 14:01.884
The air is not from your lungs.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.279
Here. Here.

14:06.106 --> 14:09.109
Kiko: Huh?

15:03.859 --> 15:04.904
Kiko: Guanches.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.124
Sorry?

15:08.864 --> 15:11.649
Kiko: The first inhabitants of
the island were called Guanches.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.609
The invented whistling language.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.527
Let's practice. Come on.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.446
How have the police
found out about us.

15:29.406 --> 15:30.451
It was a phone call.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.496
Anonymous.

15:33.758 --> 15:34.934
Whistle. Whistle.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.983
Good. The hand, very good.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.209
Remember, the tongue
is under the finger.

15:49.557 --> 15:52.299
Uh-huh.

15:55.955 --> 16:00.655
In what language
was the phone call?

16:04.224 --> 16:05.355
I don't know.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.880
All I know, it was a woman.

- Shut up!

29:08.834 --> 29:11.314
Kiko: She's the only woman
who knew about the money.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.229
Kiko: Sit!

29:13.621 --> 29:15.101
Kiko: Sit fucking down!

29:51.790 --> 29:54.444
Imagine yourself
in the middle of an ocean...

29:56.098 --> 29:59.493
and all you can see around
is water.

30:01.625 --> 30:02.801
The water is cold.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.152
The currents are very strong.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.633
Even if you are
a great swimmer...

30:10.939 --> 30:15.074
You don't know you will make it
to the shore.

30:16.336 --> 30:17.380
Can you imagine that?

30:19.295 --> 30:20.295
Yes.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.822
Paco: Besides, you have your
right arm tied to your back.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.476
Do you think
you have any chance?

30:29.305 --> 30:30.305
No.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.308
Zsolt is my right arm.

30:33.092 --> 30:34.397
And you are my left arm.

30:35.659 --> 30:38.010
I need you to free Zsolt.

30:39.446 --> 30:41.535
This is my chance
to get to the shore.

30:42.623 --> 30:43.754
If I can't...

30:47.497 --> 30:48.759
Along with my arms.

30:52.938 --> 30:53.939
Do you get me?

30:57.638 --> 30:58.639
Yes.

31:52.606 --> 31:55.043
Kiko:

33:05.548 --> 33:09.378
Gilda:

33:32.358 --> 33:33.358

Cristi:

34:41.818 --> 34:42.906
Cristi:

38:41.797 --> 38:42.797
Get out.

40:29.078 --> 40:30.645
Wake up, wake up.

40:32.908 --> 40:33.908
Come on.

40:35.563 --> 40:38.305
Today, you have your first
lesson with your new teacher.

40:40.176 --> 40:41.176
You ready?

40:50.491 --> 40:51.491
Sit, monsieur.

40:59.239 --> 41:02.068
Today, you will do your first
word in the whistling language,

41:02.677 --> 41:04.331
which is "Mama."

41:07.073 --> 41:09.554
But first,
you will do it separately.

41:10.163 --> 41:11.643
"Ma-ma."

41:20.434 --> 41:21.740
Not "Mamou."

41:23.089 --> 41:24.133
"Mama."

41:29.095 --> 41:31.010
Okay, all together now.

41:31.663 --> 41:32.663
"Mama."

41:34.883 --> 41:37.625
Now, longer again. "Ma-ma."

42:35.335 --> 42:36.510
Mother: Cristi.

42:38.033 --> 42:39.033
Cristi.

43:22.861 --> 43:24.253
Mother:

44:03.466 --> 44:04.554

44:28.013 --> 44:29.318

45:11.273 --> 45:12.535

45:15.321 --> 45:16.844

46:18.210 --> 46:20.473

46:31.005 --> 46:32.790
Magda:

46:37.098 --> 46:38.796
Magda:

46:39.797 --> 46:42.060
Zsolt:

46:45.803 --> 46:47.282
Cristi:

49:20.261 --> 49:22.698
Magda:

49:38.584 --> 49:40.412
Alin:

49:40.978 --> 49:42.849
Magda:

49:47.810 --> 49:49.073
Alin:

51:48.844 --> 51:50.324
Two days ago,

51:50.716 --> 51:54.372
I found out that Zsolt tried
to run away with the money.

51:54.720 --> 51:55.721
With my money.

51:56.983 --> 51:59.507
For sure, now he doesn't
want to escape arrest

51:59.986 --> 52:01.944
because he knows
he will face me.

52:02.510 --> 52:03.816
And I'll kill him.

52:05.426 --> 52:08.516
That means that
we need to kidnap him.

52:09.822 --> 52:12.390
I'll think about the plan
to end his days, but

52:12.564 --> 52:13.564
until then...

52:14.870 --> 52:16.524
I wanted to let you know that

52:16.872 --> 52:19.048
Zsolt's share
is for one million.

52:19.875 --> 52:21.181
I want to give it to you.

52:23.575 --> 52:24.575
Thank you.

52:28.275 --> 52:29.276
Cristi: And Gilda?

52:31.060 --> 52:32.366
Do you want her share too?

52:32.671 --> 52:33.671
Cristi: No.

52:34.716 --> 52:36.153
What will happen to her?

52:37.197 --> 52:39.286
I don't know yet.

52:40.809 --> 52:42.507
She tried to scam me too.

52:48.165 --> 52:49.209
- Finished?
- Yes.

52:49.383 --> 52:50.383
Okay, let's go.

53:42.741 --> 53:44.003
The plan is simple.

53:45.091 --> 53:47.354
In this vial,
there is a substance

53:47.963 --> 53:50.183
with no color, smell or taste.

53:50.749 --> 53:52.794
You dissolve it
in a glass of water.

53:53.491 --> 53:54.622
Nobody will notice.

53:56.494 --> 53:58.887
You'll give it to Zsolt,
to drink it,

53:59.888 --> 54:01.150
and he will feel sick.

54:02.804 --> 54:05.067
Then, you call for an ambulance,

54:05.677 --> 54:07.592
and he will be taken
to the hospital.

54:08.941 --> 54:11.073
The vial takes effect
within half an hour.

54:11.465 --> 54:13.728
And after that,
within another half hour,

54:13.946 --> 54:16.340
the doctor will have to give him
an injection of cortisone.

54:17.210 --> 54:18.342
Otherwise, he will die.

54:19.473 --> 54:21.258
Any ambulance has cortisone.

54:34.749 --> 54:35.749
Hello.

54:36.708 --> 54:37.708
Paco: Hello.

54:42.366 --> 54:43.628
I'm a film maker,

54:43.976 --> 54:46.283
and I'm scouting locations
for my next project.

54:46.848 --> 54:49.286
I love the look of this factory
from the outside,

54:49.460 --> 54:51.026
but is it possible...

54:51.200 --> 54:53.160
Do you mind if I check it out
from the inside too?

54:53.420 --> 54:55.030
Yeah, why not. Come in.

55:03.387 --> 55:04.692
It's beautiful.

55:38.987 --> 55:40.293
Gilda is there.

55:42.513 --> 55:45.124
And Kiko is over there,
in that direction.

55:47.039 --> 55:48.736
You whistle in Romanian
for Gilda.

55:49.258 --> 55:50.564
She whistles
in Spanish for Kiko,

55:50.738 --> 55:52.218
and Kiko whistles back to me.

55:52.740 --> 55:54.742
That way, we check that
the message is correct.

55:55.090 --> 55:56.090
Come on.

56:01.749 --> 56:03.360
Paco: Let's imagine
we are in Bucharest.

56:04.970 --> 56:06.580
Paco:
You gave the vial to Zsolt,

56:07.581 --> 56:09.366
and he was
taken to the hospital.

56:10.758 --> 56:12.107
Now, we are in the hospital.

56:12.891 --> 56:15.720
You whistle
that Zsolt is in room 3,

56:15.894 --> 56:18.157
floor 7,
and he's guarded by two cops.

56:40.962 --> 56:43.095
Instead of my money,
I want you to release Gilda.

56:43.922 --> 56:46.446
Are you sure?

56:47.229 --> 56:48.229
Yes.

56:50.798 --> 56:51.843
Okay.

57:43.111 --> 57:44.111
Good.

58:06.874 --> 58:07.874
Man: Your phone.

59:01.407 --> 59:03.496
Man:

59:04.062 --> 59:05.237

1:00:05.340 --> 1:00:06.472
Cristi:

1:00:31.236 --> 1:00:32.977
Man: Well,
he was here.

1:00:33.238 --> 1:00:35.153
Man 2: Sure, he was here.

1:00:35.719 --> 1:00:37.155
And now they're out there,

1:00:37.677 --> 1:00:38.765
waiting to jump us.

1:00:39.766 --> 1:00:41.463
Any more orders, captain?

1:00:42.290 --> 1:00:44.510
Man: Yes, we'll keep on going.

1:01:39.086 --> 1:01:42.960
Well, reverend, looks like
you've got yourself surrounded.

1:01:43.612 --> 1:01:46.485
Yeah, I figure I'll get myself
un-surrounded.

1:01:46.877 --> 1:01:49.053
Reverend: Woah,
how far's the river?

1:01:50.271 --> 1:01:52.665
I've been baptized, reverend.

1:01:52.926 --> 1:01:54.493
I've been baptized.

1:01:54.667 --> 1:01:55.886
Shut up, you old fool.

1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:57.975
Man 3:
Thank you kindly, thank you.

1:01:58.584 --> 1:02:00.891
Reverend: Everybody get
yourselves set for another one.

1:02:01.152 --> 1:02:05.678
'Cause when I holler, I want you
to move out of here!

1:02:10.857 --> 1:02:12.032
Reverend: Let's go!

1:03:06.173 --> 1:03:07.173
