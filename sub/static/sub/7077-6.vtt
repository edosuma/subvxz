00:17.935 --> 00:21.099
My name is Kevin,
or so they tell me.

00:21.431 --> 00:24.304
Actually, they told me my
birth name is Benjamin Chang,

00:24.349 --> 00:28.069
but I can't remember anything
before six months ago.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.930
But by using
a special, shiny glass

00:29.941 --> 00:31.694
called a mirror,

00:31.736 --> 00:34.172
I've estimated
that I'm 15 years old,

00:34.213 --> 00:36.337
although I have no way
of knowing.

00:36.916 --> 00:39.958
Changnesia is a fascinating
and extremely rare disease

00:39.983 --> 00:42.025
on the forefront of the
psychological landscape.

00:42.427 --> 00:44.636
Compared with your
garden variety amnesia,

00:44.674 --> 00:47.761
Changnesia is immeasurably
more complex.

00:49.247 --> 00:51.712
Its varied and seemingly
random symptoms,

00:52.041 --> 00:55.369
its resistance to both traditional
and new age medicine,

00:55.400 --> 00:57.473
why Changnesia
affects the memory

00:57.537 --> 00:59.704
but not the ability
to make forced puns...

00:59.767 --> 01:02.787
These are all things we can study
now that someone finally has it.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.899
I first met Chang when I hired him
as a Spanish teacher at Greendale.

01:06.214 --> 01:08.977
Then he became
a disgraced student,

01:08.999 --> 01:10.867
psychopathic music major,

01:10.879 --> 01:13.445
homeless vent dweller,
security guard, keytarist,

01:13.459 --> 01:15.886
power hungry warlord,
and now, Kevin.

01:16.175 --> 01:17.500
It's sad to see him like this.

01:17.562 --> 01:18.693
Well, it's mixed.

01:18.703 --> 01:20.187
He was pretty terrible before.

01:20.213 --> 01:23.096
I'm developing a theory
which some find controversial.

01:23.132 --> 01:25.315
Perhaps Chang
actually used to be Kevin,

01:25.334 --> 01:27.207
went crazy, and became Chang.

01:27.236 --> 01:28.468
And then, at some point,

01:28.487 --> 01:30.809
Chang hit his head,
went un-crazy,

01:30.834 --> 01:34.194
thereby reverting back
to regular old Kevin again.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.162
That makes no sense.

01:36.433 --> 01:37.788
Science tells us

01:37.831 --> 01:40.016
hitting his head
would only cure him

01:40.034 --> 01:42.139
if hitting his head
was the original cause.

01:42.497 --> 01:44.109
Told you it was controversial.

01:44.135 --> 01:46.315
Here at Greendale,
we accept all students,

01:46.327 --> 01:49.025
whoever they may be
or have forgotten they were.

01:49.050 --> 01:50.849
But assisting
in Kevin's recovery

01:50.863 --> 01:53.067
has put a financial strain
on the school.

01:53.085 --> 01:54.773
That's why we are appealing

01:54.779 --> 01:58.301
to the Macguffin Neurological Institute
for this $40,000 Grant,

01:58.319 --> 02:01.733
so we can continue to fight
this terrible disease

02:01.745 --> 02:05.121
and hopefully, one day,
pay for this documentary.

02:06.063 --> 02:08.000
How was that, Abed?
That's too beggy?

02:08.019 --> 02:09.033
No, that was great.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.466
But I could use a new camera,
with a smoother zoom.

02:11.485 --> 02:14.177
Oh, okay. Well, just be sure
to get my good side, okay?

02:14.207 --> 02:16.033
This documentary
needs to be convincing.

02:16.057 --> 02:19.597
This needs to be the hoop dreams
of things people care about.

02:19.718 --> 02:21.371
We rolling?

02:22.702 --> 02:24.267
The dean
wants a propaganda film,

02:24.286 --> 02:26.987
but I intend to explore all
sides of this serious issue,

02:27.005 --> 02:29.311
including those who don't
think it's a serious issue.

02:29.881 --> 02:31.825
- Hey, Jeff.
- What are you doing?

02:31.939 --> 02:33.444
Making a documentary
on Changnesia.

02:33.469 --> 02:35.822
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Got it. Beautiful.

02:35.838 --> 02:37.784
All right, let's get
one more for safety.

02:37.890 --> 02:39.993
Jeff, back to one.

03:06.972 --> 03:09.541
I'm telling you, we should have
sprung for the name brand glitter.

03:09.554 --> 03:12.393
Look, cheap glitter,
expensive glitter.

03:12.405 --> 03:13.760
Money talks, people.

03:13.784 --> 03:14.977
Guys, did you hear?

03:15.033 --> 03:17.928
The history of ice cream class
had another heart attack.

03:17.966 --> 03:19.694
Three more, and we're all in.

03:19.712 --> 03:20.845
Yes.

03:21.135 --> 03:23.035
What's the Macguffin Institute?

03:24.623 --> 03:26.002
Fine.
I'll tell him.

03:26.057 --> 03:29.732
But one day, you'll all be old
and slow and lose at things,

03:29.738 --> 03:31.196
and when that day comes,

03:31.215 --> 03:33.688
I won't remember
what I'm doing now.

03:34.032 --> 03:36.274
Lord, the Macguffin institute is
coming to Greendale on Friday

03:36.292 --> 03:39.685
because they might give the
school money to study Changnesia.

03:39.788 --> 03:42.599
Changnesia isn't a disease.
It's a con.

03:42.617 --> 03:44.629
You're seriously
helping this lunatic?

03:44.708 --> 03:46.476
He kept the dean in a dungeon.

03:46.503 --> 03:49.424
He tried to kill us.
He ate his twin in utero.

03:49.443 --> 03:51.561
That was Chang.
This is Kevin.

03:51.579 --> 03:52.811
They're the same idiot.

03:52.830 --> 03:55.541
How would you know? Have you ever
even spent any time with him, Jeff?

03:55.577 --> 03:59.070
I was reluctant to accept
Kevin at first, too, but...

03:59.341 --> 04:01.283
he's just so sweet.

04:01.563 --> 04:03.442
The world is brand new to him.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.090
He approaches everything
with the wonderment

04:05.115 --> 04:07.375
of a small child
or a cartoon alien.

04:07.394 --> 04:08.357
Whoa.

04:08.584 --> 04:10.534
This makes things smaller.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.521
No, no...
Bigger.

04:12.535 --> 04:14.532
Oh, bigger.

04:14.548 --> 04:17.971
Well, enjoy your collective delusion.
I'm going to go get a sandwich,

04:17.986 --> 04:20.675
which, unlike Changnesia,
is real.

04:20.736 --> 04:22.347
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:22.384 --> 04:24.082
We want to know how you feel about
the Macguffin people visiting.

04:24.107 --> 04:24.890
I need it on camera.

04:24.908 --> 04:26.113
- It's stupid.
- What's stupid?

04:26.137 --> 04:27.796
- The whole thing.
- Okay, put it together for me.

04:27.814 --> 04:30.642
"The whole thing is stupid." All right,
thanks, buddy. I'll cut it together.

04:32.996 --> 04:34.009
- Shirley.
- Hmm?

04:34.037 --> 04:36.050
You don't seriously think
Chang is Kevin, do you?

04:36.081 --> 04:38.708
No, I believe the good lord made
Chang Chang. Kevin is a choice.

04:38.763 --> 04:40.600
Thank you. I'm seriously worried
about the rest of the group.

04:40.624 --> 04:42.663
Not only have they
drunk the Kevin kool-aid,

04:42.678 --> 04:45.802
they're in the study room right now,
making banners, debating glitter...

04:45.821 --> 04:47.844
Well, I'd love to keep talking about this,
but I gotta get to work.

04:47.859 --> 04:50.254
No, Shirley, you've got
to help me stop this.

04:50.272 --> 04:52.034
You're the only
sane person left.

04:52.174 --> 04:55.551
Welcome to Shirley's sandwiches,
where the food is Kevin-ly.

04:55.901 --> 04:57.233
- You hired Chang?
- Hmm?

04:57.259 --> 04:58.685
The customers love Kevin.

04:58.848 --> 05:00.410
I think it's because
he's a good listener.

05:00.428 --> 05:03.142
Most words are new to him, so
it's all still fascinating.

05:03.183 --> 05:05.083
I'm Kevin.
And you are?

05:05.102 --> 05:06.655
Not calling you Kevin.

05:06.682 --> 05:08.814
Hi, not calling you Kevin.

05:09.270 --> 05:11.004
What are you having?

05:11.134 --> 05:12.865
- None of this.
- Okay.

05:12.933 --> 05:14.227
Uh, listen.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.961
I don't care what he calls
himself, he's a hard worker.

05:16.986 --> 05:20.325
We're all broken people, Jeffrey,
we all deserve a second chance.

05:20.352 --> 05:22.224
Like how I gave Andre
a second chance.

05:22.246 --> 05:23.808
It doesn't mean I forgot.
I just forgave.

05:23.827 --> 05:26.710
Chang didn't sleep with a stripper.
He tried to kill us.

05:26.758 --> 05:28.386
Why does everyone keep
forgetting about that?

05:28.405 --> 05:31.437
But he didn't. And you used
to be a sleazy lawyer.

05:31.463 --> 05:34.138
What if Greendale never
gave you a second chance?

05:35.246 --> 05:37.392
What Shirley said
really made me think.

05:37.455 --> 05:39.926
I mean, all my friends
believe this guy.

05:40.224 --> 05:42.599
What does it say about me
that I don't?

05:43.487 --> 05:45.053
Hmm?
Yes?

05:45.817 --> 05:48.299
Ugh, and cue wet blanket Winger

05:48.324 --> 05:50.183
to tell us that we're
all wasting our time.

05:50.195 --> 05:51.809
Actually, no.

05:51.931 --> 05:54.331
I had a really good
conversation with Shirley,

05:54.359 --> 05:56.545
and I realized
I've been acting like a jerk.

05:56.661 --> 05:57.780
If it's not too late,

05:57.822 --> 05:59.750
I'd love to help out
in any way I can.

05:59.862 --> 06:01.264
Jeffrey, that's amazing.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.226
I knew you'd come around.

06:02.245 --> 06:04.033
All right, Abed, get
us in panning singles.

06:04.050 --> 06:06.126
And can you say "powwow"
instead of "conversation"?

06:06.152 --> 06:07.227
It just sounds more you.

06:07.246 --> 06:09.735
All right, action. Okay, you going to
make an entrance? Great.

06:10.285 --> 06:11.678
What does it say?

06:12.084 --> 06:15.313
It says I have gullible friends
who will believe anybody,

06:15.338 --> 06:18.217
and I need
to make that anybody me.

06:18.236 --> 06:20.985
By exposing Chang
in front of the whole school.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.064
Wow. Much like the
classic documentary

06:23.076 --> 06:24.138
Capturing the Friedmans,

06:24.159 --> 06:26.526
my story just took a
completely unexpected turn.

06:26.546 --> 06:29.659
Jeff, if you want this done right,
I'm going to need a steadicam for Garrett.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.360
That's showbiz.

06:34.529 --> 06:37.029
We were all pretty
happy when Jeff came around.

06:37.053 --> 06:39.523
He became really gung-ho
about Abed's documentary,

06:39.541 --> 06:40.611
and had a lot of great ideas

06:40.642 --> 06:42.372
about how to impress
the Macguffin people.

06:42.406 --> 06:44.238
And that's why Pierce

06:44.329 --> 06:46.295
should host the reception.

06:46.316 --> 06:47.590
He speaks their language.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.882
Finally, somebody's
making some sense.

06:50.016 --> 06:52.348
I've got a blackface
senor Wences bit

06:52.360 --> 06:54.093
I've been workshopping.

06:54.111 --> 06:54.967
Perfect.

06:54.974 --> 06:56.378
Annie, we need to find out

06:56.391 --> 06:58.662
what happened to Kevin before
he showed up at Greendale.

06:58.681 --> 07:02.201
What hellish experiences did he
overcome during those missing months?

07:02.232 --> 07:05.445
Do you think you can use your forensic
knowhow to do some investigating?

07:05.470 --> 07:07.971
Investigating?
Obvi.

07:07.994 --> 07:08.956
Can I help?

07:09.107 --> 07:10.905
If you're willing to
learn, sure, partner.

07:10.940 --> 07:13.094
"Partner."
I like that.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.467
I'm going
to call you "Houlihan."

07:14.485 --> 07:16.480
"Partner" and "Houlihan."

07:17.211 --> 07:17.994
Okay.

07:18.013 --> 07:20.789
The postman found Kevin here.

07:20.824 --> 07:23.570
He said he was soaking wet
and smelled like fish.

07:23.661 --> 07:24.817
I know it's not a lot
to go on...

07:24.830 --> 07:26.813
Um, it's almost
too much to go on.

07:26.841 --> 07:30.266
Look, Sullivan's trout farm
is just 1/4 mile away.

07:30.310 --> 07:31.876
Who do you think you're
dealing with, Winger?

07:31.897 --> 07:33.613
I don't know, Houlihan.
Seems sort of thin.

07:33.631 --> 07:37.062
In an investigation, one dude always
has to go opposite the other dude.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.675
That's how they
get things done.

07:38.695 --> 07:39.977
Well, you guys can work it out.

07:39.994 --> 07:42.876
- Yeah, we will.
- No, we won't.

07:43.572 --> 07:45.438
- Britta, Shirley...
- Oh, that's me.

07:45.462 --> 07:46.930
I want you to take this camera

07:46.949 --> 07:48.996
and follow Chang around
for his day-to-day.

07:49.009 --> 07:51.838
Really get into the life of
a functioning Changnesiac.

07:51.869 --> 07:55.188
I want you to go
inside his home, work, pod.

07:55.219 --> 07:56.344
Just get everything.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.382
Ooh, that's great advertising
for my growing business.

07:58.397 --> 08:01.255
Okay, I'll do it. And with
my photography skills...

08:01.273 --> 08:03.293
Jeff, thank you.

08:03.491 --> 08:05.280
When the dean told me
you were going to help me,

08:05.303 --> 08:06.434
I couldn't believe it.

08:06.450 --> 08:08.594
A cool, smart lawyer
like yourself

08:08.625 --> 08:11.001
reaching out
to a little nobody like me?

08:11.076 --> 08:13.289
I never told you
I was a lawyer.

08:14.655 --> 08:15.981
No, you didn't.

08:16.014 --> 08:17.280
Shirley said it, remember?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.343
You said,
"You hired Chang?"

08:18.355 --> 08:20.046
And I said, "I'm
Kevin, and you are?"

08:20.055 --> 08:21.124
And you said,
"Not calling you Kevin,"

08:21.143 --> 08:22.914
and I said, "Hi, not calling you Kevin.
What are you having?"

08:22.926 --> 08:24.120
And you said,
"None of this."

08:24.158 --> 08:26.153
And then Shirley said, "I don't
care what he calls himself.

08:26.165 --> 08:27.185
"He's a hard worker.

08:27.216 --> 08:29.281
"We're all broken people, and
we all deserve a second chance.

08:29.293 --> 08:31.139
"Like how I gave Andre
a second chance.

08:31.153 --> 08:32.936
"Doesn't mean I forgot.
I just forgave."

08:32.955 --> 08:34.960
And you said, "Chang didn't
sleep with a stripper.

08:34.972 --> 08:35.879
"He tried to kill us.

08:35.897 --> 08:37.764
"Why does everyone keep
forgetting all that?"

08:37.784 --> 08:39.772
And then Shirley said,
"But he didn't.

08:39.792 --> 08:41.841
"And you used
to be a sleazy lawyer."

08:41.977 --> 08:42.991
Her words.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.562
Wow. That's quite a
memory you have.

08:45.574 --> 08:47.911
Well, my short term memory
has actually improved.

08:47.923 --> 08:50.601
My doctor calls it a, um...

08:52.574 --> 08:53.840
side effect.

08:53.981 --> 08:54.738
Oh.

08:54.757 --> 08:56.418
Well played, Chang.

08:56.519 --> 08:58.375
The chess match has begun.

08:58.393 --> 08:59.193
What...

08:59.224 --> 09:00.700
I'm Chinese?

09:00.841 --> 09:03.151
Do you want to get some footage
while we're waiting for Kevin?

09:03.169 --> 09:05.735
Maybe we could take some shots
of my delicious bread baking,

09:05.747 --> 09:07.189
or the affordable prices

09:07.207 --> 09:10.218
on our new Shirley's
sandwiches super saver menu.

09:10.230 --> 09:13.661
Or we could get to know the
Shirley behind the sandwiches.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.427
- Here, give me that camera.
- Oh. Okay.

09:15.449 --> 09:17.582
Be careful, now.
It's Abed's camera.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.628
- All right.
- Watch it.

09:18.640 --> 09:22.775
Oh, where is
the stop button on this?

09:22.792 --> 09:24.373
Oh, here it is.
Okay.

09:24.404 --> 09:25.821
- You want to hear my pitch?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.081
A strong, independent woman,

09:28.115 --> 09:29.613
starting her own business.

09:29.626 --> 09:32.326
An "entrepreneu-her,"
if you will.

09:32.354 --> 09:33.815
Or maybe a businesswoman?

09:33.833 --> 09:36.152
Okay, fine.
Think inside the box.

09:36.167 --> 09:38.212
All right.
Are you ready?

09:38.230 --> 09:40.330
- Mmm-hmm.
- Action.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.783
Cut. Oh! Beautiful.

09:43.814 --> 09:45.362
You don't think
the song was too much?

09:45.387 --> 09:47.760
Are you kidding me?
It made the scene.

09:47.791 --> 09:48.467
You know what?

09:48.492 --> 09:50.378
I want to get some better
lighting up in this noise.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.691
Let's go hit up Abed.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.618
I never told anybody
that story, Britta.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.404
Oh, it was beautiful.

09:55.414 --> 09:57.602
I was dead for three minutes.

09:57.614 --> 09:58.758
Three minutes?

09:58.764 --> 10:01.228
Three whole minutes.
They thought I was gone.

10:01.394 --> 10:02.326
Pierce.

10:02.429 --> 10:03.558
How's your act coming?

10:03.588 --> 10:05.735
- Blackface senor Wences?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:05.883 --> 10:07.983
How do you think it's coming?

10:09.690 --> 10:10.859
In the unlikely event

10:10.876 --> 10:12.789
I fail to expose Chang,

10:13.100 --> 10:15.930
I'm pretty confident Pierce will
make sure we don't get a Grant.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.736
What you talkin' about, hookey?

10:17.772 --> 10:20.556
Wow, that bit could not
get any more perfect.

10:20.569 --> 10:21.524
Wait a minute.

10:21.543 --> 10:25.326
I haven't introduced you
to my Asian wife yet.

10:25.911 --> 10:27.919
Uh-oh...

10:27.991 --> 10:29.032
I was wrong.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.916
- This is the place.
- No, it's not.

10:38.033 --> 10:39.175
Garrett, here he comes. Get up.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.853
I can't.
It's too heavy!

10:40.878 --> 10:41.914
Garrett, now.

10:41.935 --> 10:42.866
Now.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.470
Excuse me,
Mr. Sullivan.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.126
This is Houlihan.
I'm her partner, Partner.

10:49.151 --> 10:51.885
- Wait, I'm Partner.
- No, you're not.

10:52.399 --> 10:53.778
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

10:53.804 --> 10:55.330
What are you, the trout police?

10:55.556 --> 10:58.347
Because if you are, you're legally bound
to tell me, or else it's entrapment.

10:58.377 --> 10:59.787
We're not the trout police.

10:59.814 --> 11:02.390
Have you seen this man?

11:03.789 --> 11:06.136
One morning, I see something
coming out of the trout tank,

11:06.160 --> 11:09.122
and at first, I was scared,
because, uh, I'm the last face

11:09.134 --> 11:11.455
that a lot of trout ever see.

11:11.486 --> 11:14.224
I'm not saying that the
trout are a vengeful breed,

11:14.255 --> 11:15.865
but if they were, I...

11:16.171 --> 11:18.821
I'd probably be public enemy number one.

11:18.852 --> 11:21.816
So the figure that emerged,
it was that man?

11:21.848 --> 11:24.634
Yeah, and I was pretty relieved when
I found out it was a naked Asian guy,

11:24.657 --> 11:25.970
and not an angry trout.

11:25.988 --> 11:27.151
And when was this?

11:27.213 --> 11:29.442
Oh, it must have been
around June.

11:29.466 --> 11:31.717
I remember because
my milkweed allergies

11:31.736 --> 11:33.565
were acting up
something fierce.

11:33.615 --> 11:37.188
I gave him some clothes, and sent
him on his way the next morning.

11:37.335 --> 11:38.854
I don't know what happened
to him after that.

11:38.867 --> 11:41.372
Mr. Sullivan, how many
employees do you have here?

11:41.428 --> 11:42.734
Employees?

11:42.797 --> 11:44.454
What do I look like,
trout world?

11:45.707 --> 11:47.738
No employees.
Heh, just me.

11:48.505 --> 11:49.496
And my dog.

11:50.342 --> 11:51.884
I knew he was hiding something.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.505
A spike in production in June,

11:53.524 --> 11:55.800
at the peak
of milkweed allergy season?

11:55.824 --> 11:59.951
Something on this trout farm was
starting to smell... wrong.

12:00.377 --> 12:03.209
The problem was, I didn't have
any way to make him talk.

12:03.437 --> 12:04.603
Or did I?

12:04.854 --> 12:07.820
Well, looks like
everything checks out here.

12:07.826 --> 12:08.651
Right, Troy?

12:08.700 --> 12:11.823
No, Houlihan, I don't think
anything checks out here.

12:11.835 --> 12:14.275
No, don't fly off the handle, Partner.

12:14.295 --> 12:16.850
Oh, I will fly
off the handle, Houlihan.

12:16.877 --> 12:18.540
What the hell
are you talking about?

12:18.577 --> 12:19.876
I'm sorry,
Mr. Sullivan.

12:19.904 --> 12:22.675
Clearly, you have
nothing to hide.

12:22.710 --> 12:24.235
What are you hiding?

12:24.253 --> 12:25.555
Fine!

12:25.581 --> 12:26.795
You got me.

12:26.861 --> 12:29.492
I've been using that Asian
guy as unpaid, manual labor

12:29.504 --> 12:32.115
for three months before
I drove him into town.

12:32.141 --> 12:34.306
But he wanted me to!

12:34.609 --> 12:36.125
We were friends,

12:36.144 --> 12:40.197
and I treated him
with respect and dignity.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.311
Partner and Houlihan.

12:43.297 --> 12:44.328
Shut up, Kevin!

12:44.802 --> 12:47.168
Partner and Houlihan.

12:47.855 --> 12:48.861
I don't understand.

12:48.886 --> 12:50.136
Why would he work for no money?

12:50.161 --> 12:51.364
Because he doesn't know
about money.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.789
Kevin doesn't know about labor
laws, or 40-hour work weeks,

12:53.815 --> 12:55.633
or that that dude named him
after a dog.

12:55.657 --> 12:57.233
Growing up,
I had a cat named Troy,

12:57.258 --> 12:59.648
a bird named Troy,
and a hamster named Troy.

12:59.938 --> 13:02.138
They were all older than me.

13:02.870 --> 13:04.058
Oh, my God.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.899
I think Kevin's struggle just
got a lot sexier, Grant-wise.

13:07.919 --> 13:09.860
This is horrible.

13:10.284 --> 13:11.717
It was horrible.

13:11.995 --> 13:13.864
They were supposed to
come back with a smoking gun,

13:13.889 --> 13:15.887
and all they found was a
little human rights abuse.

13:15.915 --> 13:17.620
Which, normally, is terrible.

13:17.646 --> 13:18.834
So do you believe Kevin now?

13:18.852 --> 13:20.723
No.
I want all your footage.

13:20.757 --> 13:22.191
I know Chang slipped up.

13:22.216 --> 13:24.461
He's not smart enough
to play dumb all the time.

13:24.533 --> 13:26.054
What about
Shirley and Britta's footage?

13:26.073 --> 13:27.085
It's unusable crap.

13:27.117 --> 13:28.459
I don't care.
I want it all.

13:28.478 --> 13:29.910
Do you want it bad enough
to rent me a crane?

13:29.932 --> 13:31.442
And maybe license
an expensive song?

13:31.467 --> 13:32.824
Yeah, whatever.

13:33.314 --> 13:35.816
♪ The itsy-bitsy spider

13:36.048 --> 13:39.849
♪ went up the water spout

13:42.966 --> 13:45.381
unusable crap is generous.

13:46.233 --> 13:47.748
It goes on like this
for another 12 hours.

13:47.773 --> 13:50.746
I couldn't even get through it all,
and I sat through The Tree of Life.

13:52.806 --> 13:54.867
Wait, right there.
What's that?

13:56.058 --> 13:58.698
Oh, come on,
you slippery snake, slip up.

13:58.717 --> 13:59.787
Doubtful.
When he's alone,

13:59.793 --> 14:03.495
he mostly just practices smiling
and frowning. We've all done it.

14:11.648 --> 14:12.983
Who's he calling?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.901
Good question.

14:15.591 --> 14:16.791
We figure that out,

14:16.820 --> 14:18.717
we've got our smoking gun.

14:19.035 --> 14:20.480
And all thanks to Britta.

14:20.505 --> 14:22.138
Don't ruin this.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.226
The stage was set for
a climatic final set piece.

14:25.263 --> 14:26.891
The Macguffin people
were on campus,

14:26.910 --> 14:29.233
and Jeff had prepared
quite the presentation.

14:30.966 --> 14:32.017
You shut up.

14:32.036 --> 14:33.104
But I love you.

14:33.142 --> 14:35.020
You get yourself in the kitchen,
and make me a burrito.

14:35.039 --> 14:37.450
Oh, okay, yay!
Oh, thank you.

14:37.465 --> 14:39.144
Okay, thank you,
Pierce Hawthorne

14:39.157 --> 14:42.769
for your special blend
of playful racial humor.

14:42.796 --> 14:45.800
And genuine thoughts
on Geraldine ferraro.

14:45.812 --> 14:47.236
He's an old Teddy bear.

14:47.261 --> 14:50.283
And now, I believe Jeff
Winger has a presentation.

14:50.318 --> 14:52.184
- Yay.
- Ugh.

14:53.221 --> 14:55.332
Thank you.
I must confess,

14:55.345 --> 14:58.217
I was just a short while
ago quite skeptical

14:58.242 --> 14:59.599
about Changnesia.

14:59.610 --> 15:00.671
But, with the help
of my friends,

15:00.687 --> 15:03.443
we have uncovered a lot
about this terrible,

15:03.482 --> 15:06.651
newly-discovered,
completely real disease.

15:06.657 --> 15:09.622
I think you'll find it
as eye-opening as I did.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.065
Wait till you see
what we found.

15:11.096 --> 15:13.414
Kevin was a victim
of human trafficking.

15:13.592 --> 15:17.577
Our purpose here tonight
is to help cure Kevin

15:17.614 --> 15:19.175
of his Changnesia.

15:19.228 --> 15:21.177
Who better to jog his memory

15:21.190 --> 15:24.395
than someone special from
his allegedly erased past.

15:24.535 --> 15:29.817
So please welcome to the stage
the former Mrs. Ben Chang, Alessandra.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.321
Alessandra, come on up.

15:31.346 --> 15:32.745
Thank you.

15:37.018 --> 15:38.492
Ben...

15:38.773 --> 15:40.607
do you remember me?

15:42.615 --> 15:44.224
I'm sorry.

15:45.613 --> 15:46.814
I don't.

15:46.831 --> 15:47.807
Admit it, Kevin.

15:47.844 --> 15:49.167
You remember her.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.140
This is the woman
you never stopped loving.

15:52.165 --> 15:53.865
Hit the lights!

16:05.636 --> 16:06.436
Oh...

16:06.473 --> 16:08.464
You love her so much,

16:08.495 --> 16:12.211
you called her over and
over and over again,

16:12.234 --> 16:13.749
even though you don't know her

16:13.772 --> 16:16.941
or how to use a phone
or what a number is.

16:18.632 --> 16:19.960
What's going on here?

16:19.991 --> 16:21.501
You told me
I was here to help him.

16:21.526 --> 16:23.823
Oh, we are here
to help him, all right.

16:23.976 --> 16:28.775
We are here to help him admit that he
has been faking this whole time.

16:28.793 --> 16:30.376
Where'd you get
the number, Chang?

16:30.382 --> 16:32.213
I found it in the vents!

16:33.107 --> 16:35.342
It's 555-0190.

16:36.316 --> 16:38.883
And it was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

16:39.204 --> 16:41.596
But I always hung up,
because...

16:42.451 --> 16:44.034
I didn't know if the
person on the other end

16:44.059 --> 16:46.128
would ever want
to talk to Kevin...

16:46.867 --> 16:48.434
after knowing Chang.

16:48.491 --> 16:50.024
You seem so nice.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.761
If we were really married,

16:52.215 --> 16:55.297
I wish I could remember for even
one moment how lucky I was.

16:55.322 --> 16:56.642
- Oh...
- Aw...

16:56.654 --> 16:58.190
Oh, Ben.

16:59.926 --> 17:00.608
Uh!

17:01.506 --> 17:02.884
Jeffrey, what are you doing?

17:02.897 --> 17:06.076
Look, if he doesn't remember her,
then this wouldn't bother him.

17:06.087 --> 17:07.854
My logic is flawless!

17:10.079 --> 17:12.270
Doesn't that bother you?
That bothers you!

17:12.295 --> 17:13.088
Things got so ugly,

17:13.090 --> 17:14.848
I hesitate to even
show you this footage.

17:14.866 --> 17:16.615
But I will let you see
me reacting to it.

17:16.646 --> 17:18.842
That'll probably be
more than you can handle.

17:22.432 --> 17:23.832
Mmm...

17:25.972 --> 17:28.506
Actually, it's not that bad,
but this keeps the story moving.

17:29.453 --> 17:30.548
Hey, Alessandra,

17:30.554 --> 17:33.050
his last girlfriend
was a charred mannequin leg!

17:33.074 --> 17:34.979
Jeffrey!
Have you lost your mind?

17:35.079 --> 17:36.224
You never believed Kevin?

17:36.242 --> 17:39.186
You were just lying to manipulate
us into helping you hurt him?

17:39.200 --> 17:41.397
Jeffrey, I trusted you
and believed in you

17:41.423 --> 17:44.083
and fantasized about celebrating
over mimosas with you!

17:44.108 --> 17:46.621
Dean, if this is the sort
of uphill battle

17:46.630 --> 17:48.856
you're facing in the fight
against Changnesia,

17:48.879 --> 17:51.224
well, then, you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

17:51.243 --> 17:53.995
On behalf of the Macguffin
neurological institute,

17:54.020 --> 17:55.917
Grant granted.

17:59.824 --> 18:02.097
So...
I guess I did help.

18:02.133 --> 18:04.349
Just not in the way
I wanted to.

18:04.532 --> 18:05.630
But, on the bright side,

18:05.648 --> 18:08.216
this is the most well-documented
failure of my life.

18:12.307 --> 18:13.272
Thank you.

18:13.870 --> 18:15.947
By trying to make
Kevin a pariah,

18:16.027 --> 18:17.508
I accidentally
became more Chang

18:17.527 --> 18:19.705
than Chang at his Changiest.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.591
That's funny.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.023
Well, I didn't try
to kill anyone.

18:25.221 --> 18:26.638
Which no one
seems to care about.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.233
But you know what I'm saying.

18:30.266 --> 18:31.966
Can I sit here?

18:33.393 --> 18:35.641
You sure you want
to be seen with me?

18:35.978 --> 18:37.807
You have a brand-new
reputation to uphold.

18:39.730 --> 18:41.251
I like you.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.422
Really?

18:42.700 --> 18:45.008
Even after
everything I did to...

18:45.524 --> 18:47.031
Whoever you are?

18:47.238 --> 18:48.738
Okay, I get it.

18:48.777 --> 18:50.988
Changnesia's hard
to understand.

18:51.157 --> 18:52.999
At least, that's what
people tell me.

18:53.042 --> 18:54.414
Now, I don't know
a thing about it,

18:54.433 --> 18:58.086
which apparently is one of the symptoms,
and it's so frustrating.

18:59.904 --> 19:03.407
Look, I know Chang
was a bad guy.

19:03.657 --> 19:07.520
So he probably deserved
everything you did to him.

19:07.567 --> 19:09.284
But you're not a bad guy.

19:09.302 --> 19:11.108
You just made a mistake.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.176
And I'm willing to start
over fresh if you are.

19:17.049 --> 19:18.549
Hi.

19:18.596 --> 19:20.029
My name's Kevin.

19:20.777 --> 19:22.765
I'm not saying I believe him.

19:22.802 --> 19:27.207
But I have got an idea of what
it feels like to be Chang.

19:27.462 --> 19:28.983
Wanting to leave
that name behind

19:28.989 --> 19:31.423
is the sanest decision
anyone can make.

19:35.563 --> 19:37.030
♪ 1, 2

19:37.043 --> 19:37.879
Hi.

19:37.904 --> 19:39.182
♪ 1, 2, 3

19:39.253 --> 19:41.052
I'm Jeff.

19:43.784 --> 19:47.587
♪ But when the night is falling

19:47.899 --> 19:51.800
♪ you cannot find the light

19:51.828 --> 19:53.028
Aw.

19:53.051 --> 19:53.845
Thanks.

19:53.870 --> 19:55.968
A lot of filmmakers use crane
shots to elicit emotion.

19:55.985 --> 19:57.383
What the heck, Abed?

19:57.402 --> 19:59.882
You knew what Jeffrey was
planning to do the whole time?

19:59.900 --> 20:01.406
Why can't you ever
make a documentary

20:01.412 --> 20:03.410
about the thing you plan
to make a documentary about?

20:03.422 --> 20:05.121
Don't censor him!

20:05.160 --> 20:06.581
Censorship.

20:06.612 --> 20:08.714
- This is the documentary.
- Ugh.

20:08.731 --> 20:10.814
Abed, you gotta teach me
how to use that camera.

20:13.122 --> 20:15.524
Guys... I'm sorry.

20:15.758 --> 20:17.591
I really screwed up.

20:17.711 --> 20:19.811
I hope you can forgive me.

20:19.908 --> 20:21.407
Already forgotten.

20:21.456 --> 20:22.355
Oh...

20:23.239 --> 20:24.789
- Kevin...
- What are we laughing about?

20:24.819 --> 20:26.867
- Oh, Kevin.
- Kevin...

20:27.699 --> 20:29.387
- Adorable.
- Good job.

20:29.456 --> 20:31.056
I don't get it.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.706
Hi, it's me.

20:42.968 --> 20:44.705
They all finally bought it.

20:44.762 --> 20:46.962
Hook, line, and Winger.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.535
I patiently await
your further instructions.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.699
Chang out.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.789
Why did I do that?
Man...
