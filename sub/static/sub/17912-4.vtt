01:02.796 --> 01:04.432
Hello, everybody!

01:04.498 --> 01:06.200
Hello. Greetings. Thank you.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.137
Hi, there.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.472
Hello! Hello!

01:12.873 --> 01:15.543
Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.212
Thank you so much. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.481
And welcome to
The Grand Tour,

01:20.548 --> 01:22.983
which, once again,
is in Whitby.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.923
There is actually
a very good reason for that.

01:29.990 --> 01:33.594
It is because these two
last week blew up my house,

01:33.661 --> 01:36.230
and I literally have
nowhere else to go.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.431
Yeah.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.000
Plus-- Plus, James May
lost the tent bag.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.469
- Soz.
- Yeah, he did.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.272
He did do that.
Anyway, erm...

01:44.338 --> 01:47.675
we were reminiscing,
as we've been here all week,

01:47.741 --> 01:51.345
and we worked out
that Yorkshire
is the only place on earth

01:51.412 --> 01:55.082
where all three of us
have had a car crash.

01:55.183 --> 01:57.285
So what was yours?

01:57.351 --> 01:59.587
A Triumph 2500 rolled over.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.922
-Yeah. Hammond?
-My first car.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.491
And my second car.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.494
My mum's car, my dad's car,

02:06.560 --> 02:08.196
my third and fourth cars,

02:08.196 --> 02:10.264
my first four motorcycles,

02:10.331 --> 02:12.065
the Radio York radio van,

02:12.200 --> 02:14.468
the Radio Leeds radio car,

02:14.535 --> 02:16.370
and a jet-powered dragster.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.772
Oh, yes.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.342
All of those. Busy.

02:21.409 --> 02:24.245
And, erm... And what about
you in Yorkshire?

02:24.312 --> 02:27.315
Well, me, I'll tell you.
No, 1977,

02:27.381 --> 02:29.383
when the driving examiner
said to me,

02:29.450 --> 02:31.752
"Congratulations,
Mr Clarkson, you've passed,"

02:31.819 --> 02:34.722
what I heard was,
"Congratulations,
Mr Clarkson,

02:34.788 --> 02:36.990
you are the best driver
I've ever seen."

02:37.057 --> 02:39.427
- Oh, no.
- 36 hours later -

02:39.493 --> 02:42.029
That's all it was, 36 hours
I'd been on the roads -

02:42.095 --> 02:43.431
stuffed my mother's Audi.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.266
Wheels came off,
killed a sheep.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.237
So, if you're the farmer,
sorry about that.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.405
Er... Anyway, I'm glad
we're still in Yorkshire,

02:51.472 --> 02:56.377
because last week we said
there was no real motoring
connection with the county,

02:56.444 --> 02:59.247
and it turns out
that's not true.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.382
I was reading Trip Advisor
last night.

03:01.449 --> 03:04.885
Now, Trip Advisor is a
website for the mealy-mouthed
and the bitter.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.520
Well, hang on.
I mean, it's not entirely--

03:06.587 --> 03:09.122
No, seriously, it's useless
apart from anything else,

03:09.257 --> 03:14.262
because you have to know
someone before their opinion
is relevant.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.096
I mean, I know Hammond, OK?

03:16.163 --> 03:18.532
So if he tells me
a restaurant's great,

03:18.599 --> 03:21.335
I know
I don't want to go there,
because it'll be rubbish.

03:21.402 --> 03:25.038
You're absolutely right,
actually, because that bloke
in the hat over there,

03:25.105 --> 03:28.909
I don't care how many stars
he gives Oxfam Whitby,
I'm not going there.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.513
Exactly. Anyway...

03:34.147 --> 03:37.285
I went on Trip Advisor,
OK, and there was
a review of Whitby.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.688
And it said,
and I'm quoting here,

03:40.754 --> 03:44.758
"One aspect of Whitby
is the large number
of local chavs..."

03:46.294 --> 03:48.596
"...who drive around
the town in a circuit

03:48.662 --> 03:51.699
in their
noise-enhanced cars."

03:51.765 --> 03:54.335
Already,
I don't like this person.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.169
"They accelerated
down the narrow streets

03:56.304 --> 04:00.408
and then slowed their engines
down quickly as they
approached a junction,

04:00.474 --> 04:03.644
causing explosive-sounding
backfiring."

04:05.045 --> 04:06.447
He sounds like a right knob.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.715
Of course he's a right knob,

04:07.781 --> 04:10.117
he's leaving a message
on Trip Advisor.

04:10.183 --> 04:13.921
Anyway, the police -
the police, the local
police here -

04:13.987 --> 04:16.490
they've decided
they've had enough of people,
how they put it,

04:16.557 --> 04:21.529
"...driving away in a manner
that causes their wheels
to spin and screech."

04:21.595 --> 04:23.531
OK? So they decided
to have a clampdown.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.799
But,
and this is the quote I love,

04:25.866 --> 04:29.069
"The operation was curtailed
due to poor weather."

04:31.472 --> 04:32.806
What, are they saying...

04:32.873 --> 04:34.942
They didn't go out
because it was raining?

04:35.008 --> 04:37.945
No, law enforcement
in Whitby is like cricket.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.348
Everybody just goes inside
if it starts to drizzle.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.851
So this is... This is
the Whitby Town Police
we are talking about here?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.853
-Yeah, the WTPD.
-Yeah.

04:47.355 --> 04:50.023
No, hang on a minute,
this is North Yorkshire.
It's NYPD.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.594
Wow!
It actually is!
It's the NYPD!

04:53.661 --> 04:56.364
That would be
a brilliant police drama.

04:56.364 --> 04:57.798
"Right, Constable,

04:57.865 --> 05:01.735
I've had the Chief Constable,
he's chewed my arse,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.738
the Mayor's chewed his arse,
now we'll chew your arse."

05:05.773 --> 05:07.608
"We've got these lads -
well, chavs -

05:07.675 --> 05:09.677
"that are doing,
like, wheel screeches,

05:09.743 --> 05:13.981
and you've got 48 hours to
solve it, or I'll have your
badge and your truncheon."

05:15.416 --> 05:18.819
Anyway,
on our car show tonight...

05:19.720 --> 05:21.789
a tree falls over...

05:23.457 --> 05:25.559
... a hedgehog
makes a noise...

05:27.294 --> 05:29.029
...and a dog eats some meat.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.900
But we begin with Porsche.

05:32.966 --> 05:37.137
They offer an immense
and immensely complicated
range of cars

05:37.204 --> 05:39.407
all under the 911 banner.

05:39.473 --> 05:43.544
Now, Porsche enthusiasts,
by which I mean
these two imbeciles,

05:43.611 --> 05:46.113
say that they're all
slightly different.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.548
Completely different.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.182
No, slightly different,

05:49.249 --> 05:53.086
and that the best of
the bunch is something
called the GT3 RS.

05:53.153 --> 05:57.625
So I thought
I'd take it to our track
to see what it was like.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.428
And let's just hope that,
for once in your life,

06:00.494 --> 06:02.129
you haven't
behaved like a child.

06:02.195 --> 06:06.299
-What do you mean?
-Well, just said it's no good
because I've got one.

06:06.434 --> 06:11.805
Hammond, I am a professional
motoring journalist,
and coming up...

06:14.508 --> 06:15.676
Amongst other things.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.179
Coming up now
is my professional review.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.819
This is the car in question.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.458
No, wait. Sorry. Hang on.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.359
It's easy to be confused.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.594
This is it.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.833
The hottest, hardest,

06:39.900 --> 06:42.636
tightest 911 of them all...

06:44.337 --> 06:45.873
...and the most exotic.

06:57.485 --> 07:01.889
It has the fattest back tyres
I've ever seen on a road car.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.625
It has scaffolding
in the back for stiffness,

07:04.692 --> 07:07.260
carbon-fibre body panels
for lightness.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.797
The roof is made
from magnesium,

07:09.863 --> 07:12.500
so if you turn it over
and there are sparks,

07:12.500 --> 07:14.835
there will be
a blinding flash of light,

07:14.902 --> 07:16.804
and then you will have
a convertible.

07:26.313 --> 07:30.818
Like many people,
I don't really like the idea
of the Porsche 911,

07:30.884 --> 07:33.954
and I certainly don't like
the people who drive them.

07:34.021 --> 07:38.692
I find them flawed,
in some dark and
rather disgusting way.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.528
But I will grudgingly admit

07:40.594 --> 07:43.597
that even the basic
cooking models are...

07:43.664 --> 07:45.966
extremely lovely to drive.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.034
They're...

07:47.100 --> 07:49.537
They're just very good
sports cars.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.407
But what about this one?

07:54.542 --> 07:55.576
Well...

07:56.610 --> 07:58.211
Let's find out.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.420
Straight away,
I can tell you the engine...

08:07.555 --> 08:09.356
is incredible.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.160
There's no turbocharging.

08:13.226 --> 08:18.098
It's just a four litre
flat-six, but...

08:18.165 --> 08:20.568
you get 500 horsepower.

08:21.635 --> 08:25.338
And its red line at 9,000rpm.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.380
9,000!

08:33.446 --> 08:35.082
That's bike territory.

08:37.117 --> 08:41.855
But the best thing is the way
it goes round corners.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.625
Because it's got
four-wheel steering,

08:44.692 --> 08:49.262
and because the engine
is sitting right over
the rear axle,

08:49.329 --> 08:52.666
the grip is just astonishing.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.107
I've engaged all
the hero buttons down here,

09:00.173 --> 09:04.411
turned all the electronic
driver aids off,

09:04.477 --> 09:07.981
and let see
if I can unstick it.

09:08.048 --> 09:12.452
In here far too fast
into Swindon Swings.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.858
Not "Swings,"
that's something
completely different.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.194
But, anyway,
no loss of traction at all.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.267
I thought, when I read
the spec sheet on the RS,

09:27.334 --> 09:30.638
that Porsche
had tried to make a supercar,

09:30.704 --> 09:35.275
a rival for Ferrari
and McLaren and Lamborghini,
but they haven't.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.177
It's still a sports car.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.647
It's still chuckable
and deft.

09:44.952 --> 09:48.288
Whoa! It's very, very good.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.657
Annoyingly.

09:55.796 --> 09:59.066
But... is it as good as this,

09:59.132 --> 10:02.035
the BMW M4 GTS?

10:02.102 --> 10:07.641
Like the Porsche,
it's made from exotic
lightweight materials...

10:07.708 --> 10:11.478
and fitted with scaffolding
instead of back seats,

10:11.544 --> 10:13.180
and enormous tyres.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.050
It looks good.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.986
But there are some problems.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.590
When you arrive at a small
speed hump in the Porsche,

10:23.657 --> 10:27.060
you raise its nose
electrically and all is well.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.965
But when you arrive at
the same hump in the BMW...

10:33.701 --> 10:36.804
you will need a team of men
to fold away the spoiler

10:36.870 --> 10:39.572
and adjust the ride height.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.308
This takes several hours.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.246
There are some other issues
as well.

10:48.015 --> 10:51.852
To give owners the sense
they're driving a racing car,

10:51.919 --> 10:54.855
all of the storage bins
have been removed.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.825
There's no cubbyhole here,
no door pockets.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.060
That means there's
nowhere to put anything.

11:00.127 --> 11:04.297
And I think that,
on a day-to-day basis, that
would drive you a bit mad.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.238
Then there's the ride,
which is extremely bumpy,

11:11.304 --> 11:14.908
and the drone from the tyres,
which is horrendous.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.747
After ten minutes
on a motorway,

11:19.780 --> 11:21.214
you will have a headache,

11:21.281 --> 11:23.751
and you won't have any
headache pills with you,

11:23.784 --> 11:25.152
because there was
nowhere to put them.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.423
Now, at this point,
I would normally use
the word "however"

11:30.490 --> 11:33.761
and start talking about
the car's good points.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.563
However...

11:36.629 --> 11:38.799
I can't, because...

11:40.567 --> 11:41.969
I'm struggling to find any.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.039
The engine, for example,
has water injection,

11:46.106 --> 11:48.475
which sounds cool.

11:48.541 --> 11:52.212
But it means
that every third time
you fill the car with fuel,

11:52.279 --> 11:55.949
you have to fill
a water tank in the boot.

11:56.016 --> 12:01.955
I don't know, but I'm not
sure this is very hi-tech.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.128
And then there's
the steering, which
in comfort mode is horrid,

12:08.195 --> 12:11.298
and in sport setting
is even more horrid.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.168
That said,
the steering wheel is nice.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.270
It's good and thick. It's...

12:17.337 --> 12:20.974
It's like holding onto
something from
the Ron Jeremy range.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.910
And the seats aren't bad.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.111
But other than that...

12:25.712 --> 12:26.947
No.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.817
A point that becomes
even more obvious

12:29.883 --> 12:32.352
when you go into battle
against the Porsche.

12:37.724 --> 12:41.161
We both have
around 500 horsepower,

12:41.228 --> 12:44.097
both have a top speed
of around 190,

12:44.164 --> 12:47.534
but the Porsche
is a lot lighter.

12:49.837 --> 12:53.140
Probably because it doesn't
have a tank full of water
in the boot.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.450
Struggling to keep up now.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.888
Here we go, into Swindon.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.890
Oh, "Springs"!

13:09.957 --> 13:11.959
A pampas grass shop.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.494
Oh! We're having...
God, that's nasty.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.299
This is not a car
that responds well

13:19.366 --> 13:22.569
to my rather brutal
driving style.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.006
The problem is...

13:26.073 --> 13:29.943
it doesn't really respond
very well to delicacy,
either.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.885
This competition here now
between these two cars

13:37.885 --> 13:41.922
is like a boxing match
between an actual boxer

13:41.989 --> 13:44.257
and someone
who thinks they're a boxer

13:44.324 --> 13:46.493
because they're wearing
satin shorts.

14:10.984 --> 14:15.923
How did BMW get
this thing so wrong?

14:15.956 --> 14:17.157
Oh, God!

14:19.292 --> 14:23.030
It's twitchy,
it's unpredictable.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.331
And in the rain,

14:24.397 --> 14:27.968
it's somewhere between
spiteful and undrive...

14:28.035 --> 14:29.970
Oh, God! ...undriveable.

14:36.609 --> 14:40.547
But, that said, this has to
be the winner of this test

14:40.613 --> 14:42.582
because Richard Hammond...

14:43.984 --> 14:45.452
...has got one of those.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.160
I called it.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.728
That was annoying.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.664
That was
a professional review.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.999
At points.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.467
But you were doing so well,

15:00.533 --> 15:02.269
and then you ruined it
at the end.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.336
What do you mean, ruined it?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.972
By saying you'd have
a worse car

15:05.005 --> 15:06.673
because I haven't got one.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.276
-That Porsche wounded me.
-Wounded you?

15:09.342 --> 15:12.812
It did wound me,
because, you know,
it's got so much grip

15:12.879 --> 15:14.247
that you're sort of
forced into the seat?

15:14.314 --> 15:16.083
And the seat's
got stitching on it

15:16.149 --> 15:17.517
which digs a hole
in your back.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.552
I've got a picture
of what it did. Look at this!

15:19.619 --> 15:21.588
That's my back!

15:21.654 --> 15:25.092
Oh, I'm amazed
you weren't hospitalised
with that! That's horrific!

15:25.158 --> 15:27.995
-That is a savage wound!
-Mine's never done that
to me.

15:28.061 --> 15:31.331
That's cos you're a midget!
You don't reach that
high up the seat.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.866
Or maybe you're a freak
and sit in the wrong place.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.336
It's not just the fact
it wounds you.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.539
Also, the Porsche's
more expensive than the BMW.

15:39.606 --> 15:43.010
Yes, but I'd rather spend
£131,000 on the Porsche

15:43.010 --> 15:46.813
than £120,000 on a BMW that's
not very good on the road,

15:46.879 --> 15:48.248
not very good on a track,

15:48.315 --> 15:50.183
and no good
at all in the rain.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.684
Yeah, no,
that's fair enough.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.120
-Hold on.
-What?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.122
I've got to the bottom of
the problem with the BMW.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.889
It's right here
in the blurb.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.491
"Developed on
the Nürburgring."

16:00.360 --> 16:02.262
Yeah, and, actually,
speaking of tracks,

16:02.329 --> 16:05.465
it's now time
to hand the M4 over

16:05.532 --> 16:09.802
to a man who thinks
that sparkling water
is basically communist.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.405
Yeah, time to give it
to the American.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.676
There he is.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.945
And he's off! No messing.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.647
Parps from the exhaust
on the upshifts

16:20.713 --> 16:23.250
as he attacks
the Isn't Straight.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.552
I wonder if he actually
knows what he's in.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.054
Driving a BMW.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.290
British Motor Works.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.425
So, that's a no, then.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.594
OK, continuing up the Isn't.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.131
They say it's got more power.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.535
Than what,
my damn toothbrush?

16:42.602 --> 16:44.237
OK.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.207
Right to the end
of the Isn't now,

16:47.274 --> 16:48.841
and into Your Name Here.

16:48.908 --> 16:51.111
Hard on the brakes,
keeping it all in check,

16:51.178 --> 16:55.348
and surely he'll appreciate
the turbos punching him
out of the corner.

16:55.415 --> 17:00.420
Turbos on an engine is
God's way of telling you it
ain't got enough cylinders.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.156
My mistake.
Right, back up the Isn't.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.325
Really winding up
that straight-six.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.561
I must admit, from
the outside, it sounds good.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.797
And already
he's turning in hard,

17:10.863 --> 17:12.165
round the Unexploded Bomb,

17:12.232 --> 17:15.602
into the narrowness
of Old Lady's House.

17:15.668 --> 17:19.272
Yeah, back on the power
for the bumpy bit
towards Sub Station.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.209
Idiotic splitter
in peril over the ruts.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.677
Now working
the ceramic brakes hard

17:24.744 --> 17:25.845
for the tight left.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.715
Tickle of power.
There it is.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.418
And left again
into Field Of Sheep.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.654
A whiff of oversteer,
and across the line!

17:36.889 --> 17:38.391
It looked tidy.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.826
Yeah, it looked all right.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.194
It looked tidy. Right...

17:42.329 --> 17:43.596
Let's bring up the er...

17:43.663 --> 17:45.565
Let's bring up
the leader board, if we can.

17:45.632 --> 17:49.336
Now, there we are.
We've already had
the 911 GT3 RS round.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.338
Wha-- And you're
not gonna show the lap?

17:51.404 --> 17:52.605
Nobody's interested
in watching an American

17:52.672 --> 17:55.508
being sawn in half
by a glorified Beetle.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.610
It did 1:20.4.

17:57.677 --> 18:00.147
Right, so, now let's see
what the M4 did.

18:00.147 --> 18:03.383
Let's put the time up.
There it is.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.154
Two seconds slower,
and that's a short track.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.222
That's unbelievable.
That's not good, is it?

18:09.289 --> 18:13.193
No.
It's only a second faster
than a Porsche 718.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.362
I know.
I mean, I admire BMW

18:15.428 --> 18:17.997
for trying with that car.
I really do.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.066
But, my God,
they've made a hash of it.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.335
In fact, I'm trying
to think of a metaphor

18:22.402 --> 18:25.838
for someone who's really tried
their hardest with something

18:25.905 --> 18:27.540
and it hasn't worked.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.714
No, nothing's coming to mind.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.316
I've got nothing.
I've got nothing.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.484
I've got nothing at all.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.186
So, let's...
Let's move it on.

18:39.219 --> 18:43.856
It's time for us to make
a gentle left into
Conversation Street.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.800
OK. Right, I want to begin
with the new Ford GT.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.536
You've got a picture of it
here. Now, this is...

18:56.603 --> 18:58.838
Well, you remember
the last GT they did.

18:58.905 --> 19:02.409
That was just an homage,
really, to the old GT40.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.212
This one, they say,
is actually a racing car
on the road.

19:05.278 --> 19:08.014
It's got a twin-turbo,
3.5 litre V6,

19:08.080 --> 19:09.882
seven-speed
flappy-paddle box,

19:09.949 --> 19:11.384
more than 600 horsepower.

19:11.451 --> 19:15.688
The problem is, though,
I can't think of any
racing car

19:15.755 --> 19:18.057
that works on the road,
really, ever.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.392
No, they don't.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.395
I mean, the Nissan GTR:
fabulous, fabulous car.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.665
rubbish.
It's undriveable.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.133
You know,
it's a very good point,

19:27.234 --> 19:28.701
because a racing car
on the road

19:28.768 --> 19:31.338
is a bit like trying to play
tennis with a cricket bat.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.672
It's technically possible...

19:32.739 --> 19:34.574
Two totally different
disciplines.

19:34.641 --> 19:37.644
The only trouble is,
that looks so good,
I do find myself going...

19:38.878 --> 19:42.148
Mm. You erm... You bought
the last GT, didn't you?

19:42.249 --> 19:43.750
Yes.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.985
Thank you for reminding me,
Hammond. Yes, I did.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.520
-Did that go well for you?
-No, it didn't.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.422
-Oh, did it not?
-No, it didn't.

19:49.489 --> 19:52.024
The problem was
the insurance company said it
had to have a burglar alarm,

19:52.091 --> 19:56.529
which blew usually when
my daughter was doing the
school play and ruined it,

19:56.596 --> 19:58.265
and it had to have a tracker.

19:58.265 --> 20:01.901
And there is nothing
on God's earth more
annoying than a tracker.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.936
But I've got a tracker.
It doesn't bother me
in the slightest.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.072
No, that's because you'll have
a little special place

20:06.138 --> 20:08.140
on your hall table
with a pencil outline.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.344
"I've got my keys
and must remember
to take my tracker."

20:11.411 --> 20:13.079
Because you're organised
and I'm not.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.715
One for your tracker,
for your keys, one for
your little penknife.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.784
One for some change
in case you need it.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.720
-Yeah, with 10ps and 2ps.
-And a tiny screwdriver
for mending your glasses.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.689
-He will. Oh, he will.
-No, I won't.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.557
No, it lives in a--
It just has a little pouch.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.725
You just
hang it on the hook.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.560
-Oh, does it?
-You've got a pouch?

20:27.627 --> 20:29.729
He's got a pouch
for his tracker.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.464
Especially for the tracker?

20:31.531 --> 20:33.500
-Well, yeah, because...
-What's it made of?

20:33.566 --> 20:36.035
-Well, leather, I suppose.
-A little leather pouch.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.470
Did you make it yourself?

20:37.537 --> 20:39.272
-No, it came...
-A little leather pouch.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.374
It came with the car,
believe it or not.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.410
Oh, so Ferrari
sold it to you.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.512
Was it £600?
I bet it was.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.347
No, it just
came with the car!

20:47.414 --> 20:48.981
I don't think Ferrari
give it away!

20:49.048 --> 20:50.517
The stripes
on your Ferrari, OK?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.184
Two stripes,
a bit like on that Ford.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.687
There are two stripes.
How much did you pay
for those stripes?

20:54.754 --> 20:57.189
Well, they were an option.
They were £6,000.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.329
Look. Listen, this is why
I drive a Golf GTI, OK?

21:02.329 --> 21:04.397
Because you
don't need an alarm,
you don't need a tracker,

21:04.464 --> 21:08.401
and it's five insurance
groups lower down than
the previous Golf GTI level.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.936
-Wow!
-It is!

21:10.002 --> 21:12.572
- It's because
you can't crash it.

21:12.639 --> 21:16.175
I bet I could.

21:16.242 --> 21:21.881
Anyway, have you two seen
those new pedestrian traffic
lights in Trafalgar Square?

21:21.948 --> 21:25.084
Which, if you're watching
America, is in London,
which is in Britain.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.786
Are these... Yes.

21:26.853 --> 21:30.156
These are the ones that have
got the two blokes on them,
isn't it?

21:30.222 --> 21:32.024
James, don't be sexist!

21:32.091 --> 21:34.361
-Why is that...?
-No, because what
if you're a lesbian?

21:34.394 --> 21:37.263
- Well, you would put
two women on it.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.098
Well, then
what if you're straight?

21:39.165 --> 21:41.701
-A man and a woman?
-But traffic lights
are only this big.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.903
You can't have a man
and a man, a man and a woman,

21:43.970 --> 21:46.606
a man who isn't sure,
and a woman and a woman--

21:46.673 --> 21:50.810
What if... What if you
just want to cross the road?

21:50.877 --> 21:54.146
What... It's like being
in the '70s with you two!

21:54.213 --> 21:58.518
Crossing the road is now
an opportunity for you
to express your sexuality.

21:58.585 --> 22:02.555
It is. That's why they've
come up with these traffic
lights in London.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.023
What are they for?

22:04.090 --> 22:05.892
No, they really have.
They really have.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.927
- They're real?
- They are for real.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.096
What's that one
on the right, then?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.264
Hello! Transgender.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.468
What?
So, hang on, only tran...

22:15.535 --> 22:17.404
- Yeah.
- What?

22:17.404 --> 22:19.539
Transgender traffic lights.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.108
- I didn't know that.
- So only...

22:22.174 --> 22:25.011
Only transgender people
can cross when that's green?

22:25.077 --> 22:26.312
No!

22:26.413 --> 22:28.047
When it goes red,
does that mean

22:28.114 --> 22:29.516
it's not OK
to be transgender?

22:29.582 --> 22:31.551
That's a good point.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.152
I don't know what happens
when it goes red.

22:33.219 --> 22:35.788
No way they're gonna say,
"It's not a..." I don't know.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.425
And what has any of this got
to do with crossing the road?

22:38.425 --> 22:41.694
That's all you want to do.
It's nothing to do with
expressing your sexuality.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.696
It's the wrong time.
I want to cross the road.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.331
All I want to do
at that point

22:45.432 --> 22:47.266
is work out how to go
to the other side.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.901
And by that I don't mean...

22:50.136 --> 22:51.871
No. I don't...

22:53.139 --> 22:54.441
I mean...

22:55.875 --> 22:57.610
...of the road.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.446
Maybe you're right, it is.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.781
Right, now,
can I talk about Alfa Romeo?

23:01.848 --> 23:03.315
- No.
- Why?

23:03.450 --> 23:05.184
Because we have to
introduce our next film.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.954
Now, as we know, in recent
years the world's carmakers

23:08.020 --> 23:10.723
have made great strides
to make more fuel-efficient

23:10.790 --> 23:13.460
and environmentally-friendly
car engines,

23:13.460 --> 23:15.161
but very little has been
done to make more

23:15.227 --> 23:18.465
environmentally-friendly
car bodies and interiors.

23:18.498 --> 23:21.834
Yeah, by and large,
they are still made
of steel and plastic,

23:21.901 --> 23:24.036
and that consumes
a huge amount of energy.

23:24.103 --> 23:28.708
So we had an idea. Are there
more sustainable materials
that could be used instead?

23:28.775 --> 23:32.645
Well, to find out,
each of us bought
a Land Rover Discovery.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.881
We then removed
its metal body

23:34.947 --> 23:39.251
and replaced it
with whatever we thought
was the best solution

23:39.318 --> 23:41.521
for the future of the planet.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.760
The meeting point
was in Wales,

23:47.827 --> 23:50.196
and I was the first
to arrive,

23:50.262 --> 23:52.499
in a car made from mud.

23:56.268 --> 24:00.306
But, sadly,
before I had the chance to
tell you anything about it,

24:00.372 --> 24:01.674
Hammond arrived.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.984
Oh, yeah.
Let me talk you through this.

24:12.051 --> 24:15.822
What I've done, I've built
a frame out of hazel,

24:15.888 --> 24:18.558
through which I have weaved
English flowers and shrubs.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.292
It's basically a hedgerow.

24:20.359 --> 24:22.529
Better still, it is growing,
because I've planted them

24:22.529 --> 24:25.865
so it's got compost
and soil to provide
the nutrients required

24:25.932 --> 24:28.034
to let my car
flourish and bloom.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.870
You don't... You don't wash
this car, you water it.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.573
It's alive.
It's brilliant, isn't it?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.175
-Clematis?
-No, it's cleared up.

24:36.242 --> 24:40.012
-Have you become a hippie?
-No, but I can feel it
starting inside me.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.548
-What have you done?
-Well...

24:41.614 --> 24:43.616
Sadly,
before I could tell him,

24:43.683 --> 24:46.218
Jeremy arrived...
in a snuff movie.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.930
Gentlemen,
I can see what's happened.
Wha...

24:57.997 --> 25:02.769
You're speechless, because
all the words in your head

25:02.835 --> 25:06.573
have been sucked out by
the magnetism of my genius.

25:06.606 --> 25:10.042
A car made from
bone and skin.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.411
- What bones?
- Animal bones.

25:12.478 --> 25:15.381
Bones are no good for this.
You can't use bones
to make cars.

25:15.447 --> 25:18.985
Why not? When your dog dies,
what do you do now?
You bury it.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.187
-I don't turn her into
a boot lid!
-Why not?

25:21.253 --> 25:23.656
Because I don't want
to see a little face
stretched across--

25:23.723 --> 25:26.593
You don't have the face!
I haven't got a face on it.

25:26.593 --> 25:27.927
It's just the bones.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.329
So as Granny gets older,
does the family sit around

25:30.396 --> 25:32.699
planning a new
little hatchback?

25:32.765 --> 25:34.166
Now, I hadn't
thought of people.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.468
There's not a lot
of dignity in it, is there?

25:36.603 --> 25:38.237
Have you used ears
for wing mirrors?

25:38.304 --> 25:39.672
-Yes.
-You're sick!

25:39.739 --> 25:41.941
Why would you not do that?
They're designed for that.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.443
-No, they're not.
-Well, they are.

25:44.510 --> 25:48.981
-They're not reflective.
-They absorb information and
pass it on to the creature.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.750
-Look at my windscreen.
-What is that?

25:50.817 --> 25:52.885
It's...
the digestive system -

25:52.952 --> 25:55.622
well, part of the digestive
system - of an cow.

25:55.622 --> 25:56.989
What part
of the digestive system?

25:57.056 --> 25:59.125
- Its stomach lining.
- Not its stomach lining.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.993
-Well, where? Further back?
-Yes.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.796
Are you staring at the world
through a cow's ring?

26:06.232 --> 26:08.067
It is its anal passage.

26:08.134 --> 26:12.538
But it's stretched so thin
that it's completely
transparent.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.373
Cow's arse, horse's arse.
It's perfect!

26:14.440 --> 26:19.211
Come on! It's a lot better
than what you two have done,
which is nothing.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.948
-What's this made out of?
-Have a guess.
-Is it mud?

26:22.014 --> 26:23.650
It's mud. It's a mud car.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.351
-You've got flat tyres.
-No, they're not flat.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.987
They're pumped up
as high as they will go
without exploding.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.956
-How much does it weigh?
-Quite a lot.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.390
-How much?
-Yeah, loads.

26:31.457 --> 26:33.125
How much does it weigh,
James?

26:33.192 --> 26:34.761
-What units would you like?
-Tonnes.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.462
Five.

26:36.528 --> 26:40.366
-Five tonnes?
Well, that's just idiotic.
-Well, mud is quite heavy.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.670
-This looks safe.
-It's sustainable, is that.
That is growing.

26:43.703 --> 26:47.239
While we've been having
that conversation, this has
extended a little bit.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.408
-It just grows quietly.
-Is it actually a living car?

26:49.475 --> 26:52.912
Everything's planted.
I've put bulbs along here,
ready for spring. Daffodils.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.682
-Not safe, though, is it?
-Yes. Hazel, very strong.

26:55.715 --> 26:59.786
It's not as strong as bone.
Bone is three times stronger
than steel.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.220
Is it?

27:01.287 --> 27:04.223
Oh. Sorry, text.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.792
Mr Wilman.

27:05.858 --> 27:09.762
"Having built your cars
from nature, you will now
drive through it,

27:09.829 --> 27:11.263
to the Myarth Hill,

27:11.330 --> 27:14.867
where you will take part in
a green motorsport event."

27:14.934 --> 27:17.704
-What green motorsport event?
-He doesn't say.

27:17.737 --> 27:21.908
A motorsport event
that is presumably
ecological in some way.

27:21.974 --> 27:22.975
OK.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.911
Before setting off,

27:24.977 --> 27:27.613
we consulted a map to see
where we were going.

27:27.714 --> 27:30.116
Right, so that's the UK.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.985
We're here,
and we've got to get to here.

27:35.087 --> 27:38.290
Well... that doesn't look
like too much of a challenge.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.493
With that sorted,
we saddled up

27:41.560 --> 27:45.331
and began
our epic 11-mile journey.

27:46.632 --> 27:47.834
Look at the smoke!

27:47.900 --> 27:49.501
That's ecological.

27:49.568 --> 27:53.339
Greenpeace are gonna be
ringing him up at any moment.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.107
Tremendous.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.777
Smells of nature,
I'm in nature,

27:57.844 --> 28:00.246
I'm made of nature.

28:00.312 --> 28:05.184
It's not quick,
but it gives me more time
to enjoy God's creation,

28:05.251 --> 28:07.987
of which
I am very much a part.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.022
Oh!

28:11.490 --> 28:13.359
James!

28:17.329 --> 28:21.801
We've done ten seconds,
and James...

28:21.868 --> 28:25.905
I may be losing one of my -
I think the correct technical
term is the A-pillar.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.807
Now it's gone completely.

28:29.909 --> 28:32.945
Oh, dear!

28:34.914 --> 28:38.384
Surely
he has to admit defeat?

28:38.450 --> 28:40.586
There's not
much car left now.

28:40.652 --> 28:43.522
Oh, dear, James.

28:43.589 --> 28:45.091
I think we can count you out.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.525
-But it doesn't matter.
-What doesn't matter?

28:46.592 --> 28:48.861
Look. You think, "Oh, James's
car's falling apart."

28:48.928 --> 28:52.965
I'm standing in my
spare-parts department.
All of it.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.633
Can be used
to rebuild your car?

28:54.700 --> 28:58.270
-It's right under there, mud.
-So it's as good as new?
-Sort of.

28:58.337 --> 29:01.974
Well, I'm sorry,
but we're gonna set off
and leave you behind.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.509
Well, hang on.
You can't leave me behind

29:03.575 --> 29:05.644
because we haven't started.
We're still in the field.

29:05.711 --> 29:06.946
- Oh, yes.
- Good point. OK, well,

29:07.013 --> 29:09.448
we're gonna set off
and go to the pub.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.383
-That's a very good idea.
-While you...

29:11.450 --> 29:14.286
-While you...
-...find some mud.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.823
I've lost my car!
Oh, it's there. It's there.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.359
With Bob The Builder
out of the way,

29:20.426 --> 29:22.561
Richard and I
settled down to appreciate

29:22.628 --> 29:27.266
the planet-saving nature of
our revolutionary eco-cars.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.536
You may be...

29:30.602 --> 29:32.038
amused by my bodywork,

29:32.104 --> 29:34.273
or perhaps horrified,

29:34.340 --> 29:39.078
but the fact is that
making steel bodies for cars

29:39.145 --> 29:45.384
produces 120 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide every year.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.854
120 million tonnes!

29:49.889 --> 29:51.891
Carmakers
will sort out clean,

29:51.958 --> 29:54.626
environmentally-friendly
engines. They will.

29:54.693 --> 29:59.231
But in the meantime, I can
tell you that the CO2
produced by this car's engine

29:59.298 --> 30:03.035
is being absorbed
and used by the bodywork.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.573
Plants breathe in
carbon dioxide
and breathe out oxygen.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.910
That's what my car's body
is doing right now.

30:12.411 --> 30:16.916
Jumpers, Sunday lunch...
spare parts.

30:16.983 --> 30:19.785
You don't need
a foundry or a furnace

30:19.852 --> 30:21.453
to build the body
for this car.

30:21.520 --> 30:25.091
You just need animals
to make love to one another.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.895
That's what this car is
really. It's a sex machine.

30:30.429 --> 30:34.934
Meanwhile, back at base,
James was having a rethink.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.103
I've decided to abandon
my original idea

30:37.169 --> 30:39.605
because it was just
too weak and too floppy,

30:39.671 --> 30:42.975
and instead I'm going to
build a car out of bricks.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.911
The basic materials
for making the bricks

30:44.977 --> 30:47.947
are fresh mud
with a bit of water in it,

30:48.014 --> 30:51.517
er... some straw
to give it strength,

30:51.583 --> 30:53.385
and some sheep poo.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.955
You then use that
to make the brick shape,

30:56.022 --> 30:57.723
and then you fire those
in a kiln.

30:57.789 --> 31:00.259
Then you use the bricks to
build the thing like a house.

31:00.326 --> 31:03.362
Except, of course, it will be
roughly the shape of a car.

31:05.197 --> 31:10.236
Back on the road,
Hammond had called
our eco convoy to a halt.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.704
-What's the matter?
-Shh.

31:12.771 --> 31:13.973
Shush what?

31:14.040 --> 31:15.641
There's a bustle
in my hedgerow.

31:17.143 --> 31:19.545
Well, don't be alarmed now.

31:19.611 --> 31:24.450
-It's probably just a...
spring clean.
-What, for the May Queen?

31:24.516 --> 31:27.954
As it turned out,
I'd picked up a passenger.

31:29.021 --> 31:31.023
Hold on. There! Look!

31:31.090 --> 31:32.591
Oh! It's a hedgehog!

31:32.658 --> 31:34.326
Yeah! He's moved in.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.697
Do hedgehogs have bones?
He could be a door mirror.

31:38.764 --> 31:41.533
He's now a member of
my little community in here.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.402
You're not using him
to make a door mirror.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.604
-No, but when he dies--
-He lives here!

31:45.671 --> 31:47.173
Hedgehogs die.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.330
Oh, he's got a mouse
in his little bird box.

32:11.397 --> 32:15.001
And it's got the biggest
testes I've ever seen!

32:17.569 --> 32:20.272
Eventually, Richard and I
arrived at the pub.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.512
Oh, hello!
Oh, mate! You fool!

32:28.447 --> 32:29.648
Oh! Oh, look.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.084
Clean break.
That'll never...
You're gonna need pins.

32:32.151 --> 32:35.254
Shut up! Your car's
given me hay fever.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.788
I can't see through my eyes.

32:36.855 --> 32:39.258
Oh, so you crashed your car
because mine's got flowers on

32:39.325 --> 32:43.062
and not because you built
your windscreen out of
a cow's balloon knot?

32:43.129 --> 32:46.265
Let's not get bogged down
with who caused the accident,
cos it was you.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.334
I am now gonna go
and get some spare parts.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.701
Of course you are.
That'll be easy.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.670
Maybe there'll be a nice zoo
in this tiny village.

32:51.737 --> 32:53.405
No, hospital.
Old folks' home.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.042
You could wait--
Just find one of those
old ladies with...

32:57.809 --> 32:59.345
Back at the start point,

32:59.411 --> 33:02.414
the eco-warrior was
ramping up the pace.

33:22.568 --> 33:23.435
Watch that go.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.339
Meanwhile, back at the pub,

33:27.406 --> 33:30.609
I was repairing
my damaged front end.

33:30.676 --> 33:34.080
Well, annoyingly,
the pork that I bought

33:34.080 --> 33:35.714
is sort of triangular
and doesn't look right.

33:35.781 --> 33:38.284
It doesn't really fit,
so I've got a side of beef,

33:38.350 --> 33:40.152
which I think will be great.

33:40.219 --> 33:42.488
Now, I'm just erm...
clearing away the old bone.

33:50.396 --> 33:53.132
No, shoo! Shoo in Welsh.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.302
I'm warning you.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.105
How would you like to be
a petrol filler cap?

34:03.342 --> 34:04.510
What do you think?

34:04.576 --> 34:06.278
I actually think it
looks rather stylish,

34:06.345 --> 34:10.216
because it immediately looks
ecological, recyclable,

34:10.282 --> 34:12.318
sustainable -
all those things.

34:12.384 --> 34:15.121
You get a single-skin
brick wall.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.556
It builds up very neatly,
as you can see.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.292
It is exactly the same as
making something out of Lego.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.128
If you have lots of Lego...

34:29.601 --> 34:31.670
Right.

34:31.737 --> 34:35.874
Clearly,
James was not going to get
his car built that day,

34:35.941 --> 34:40.779
so Richard and I decided to
spend the night at the pub.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.748
How far have we come today?
Just remind me.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.383
We're still in the same
field where we started.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.017
-Well, he is.
-Yes.

34:46.152 --> 34:49.621
-We're in a pub.
- But we have to go back
to the start to start.

34:51.390 --> 34:53.259
-It's not the best start.
-No.

34:53.325 --> 34:55.194
-Erm...
-How do we know?
We haven't started yet.

34:55.261 --> 34:59.565
Precisely, so, actually,
it might yet be a brilliant
start when the start starts.

35:04.636 --> 35:05.671
Ow!

35:11.210 --> 35:14.980
His one was useless.
It's his slap-happy attitude
to making things.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.982
Attention to detail.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.350
Thank you very much.

35:18.417 --> 35:22.188
Anyway, now it is time
for Celebrity Brain Crash!

35:28.794 --> 35:31.062
Now, last week...

35:31.197 --> 35:32.898
Last week,
as I'm sure you'll remember,

35:32.964 --> 35:37.636
our guest Simon Pegg
sadly fell into
the harbour and drowned.

35:37.703 --> 35:40.639
Er... But there's no danger
of that happening this week,

35:40.706 --> 35:44.376
because our guest is actually
starting in the harbour.

35:44.443 --> 35:47.279
He is one of Britain's
top comedians

35:47.346 --> 35:49.648
and a jet-ski enthusiast.

35:49.715 --> 35:53.752
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Jimmy Carr!

35:55.221 --> 35:57.223
Here he comes now, look,
on the screen...

35:57.223 --> 35:59.325
and he's looking good!

35:59.391 --> 36:02.328
He is.
What are we going to
ask him when he gets here?

36:02.394 --> 36:05.231
I'm gonna ask him, actually,
about erm...

36:05.297 --> 36:07.333
that story he told me
once when we were on holiday.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.235
No, you can't ask
him about that on air.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.669
Ofcom, they won't like it.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.571
Why does Ofcom...
We're on the internet.

36:12.638 --> 36:15.307
Yeah, but we're
still broadcast.
You can't tell that story.

36:17.276 --> 36:18.944
Whoa! Hang on! Hang on!

36:19.010 --> 36:21.380
I don't want to interrupt.
He's come in very hot.

36:21.447 --> 36:24.983
No, what's this boat doing?
Shush, everyone! Shush!

36:25.050 --> 36:26.252
The boat! Stop the...

36:26.252 --> 36:27.753
Oh, for God's sake! The boat!

36:30.121 --> 36:32.258
Oh, my God.

36:48.707 --> 36:52.744
As you may have noticed,
the audience there applauding
the tragic death...

36:54.980 --> 36:58.284
...of one of Britain's
best-loved comedians,
Jimmy Carr.

36:59.485 --> 37:02.053
Does that mean
he's not coming on, then?

37:02.120 --> 37:04.290
Well, James, he's burst

37:04.323 --> 37:07.559
and is now basically chum
on the waters of the harbour,

37:07.626 --> 37:09.528
so that's a no,
he's not coming on.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.530
This is a dis...
It's awkward.

37:11.597 --> 37:14.300
-It's every single week.
-We're getting a reputation.
People are gonna notice.

37:14.300 --> 37:20.205
It's OK, though. I've just
thought of something else
we can do to fill the time.

37:20.306 --> 37:21.540
You... You know what it is.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.775
-You go outside, and you.
-Do I have to do this?

37:23.842 --> 37:25.677
Yes, I'm afraid you do.
Could you go that way?

37:25.744 --> 37:27.679
Go get it. Quickly, quickly.
Run, run, run.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.748
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:29.815 --> 37:33.852
please try not to look at
the hideous bloodstained
water out of the window.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.323
You see, the thing is...
The thing is

37:37.323 --> 37:40.392
that when immigrants try
to get into the country,

37:40.459 --> 37:42.728
they always come in the back
of a container lorry,

37:42.794 --> 37:46.398
and I always think that is
the world's worst game
of hide-and-seek.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.401
Cos if you work for
Homeland Security...
No, what's it called here?

37:49.468 --> 37:53.472
Border Force? ...Border
Force, you open the doors
and, "Well, there you are."

37:53.539 --> 37:59.345
So I was thinking,
surely there must be a better
way of getting into Britain?

37:59.345 --> 38:02.147
And I think
I've worked it out.

38:02.348 --> 38:05.116
- So, James,
could you bring the car in?
Yes.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.518
Yes, good man.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.719
Right, here he comes now,

38:07.786 --> 38:10.489
at his usual top speed
of eight,

38:10.556 --> 38:14.025
in what is
an Audi TT Quattro.

38:14.092 --> 38:17.429
That's perfect. Thank you
so much, James.
If you'd like to step out.

38:17.496 --> 38:21.433
Now, Richard Hammond
is in this car.

38:23.234 --> 38:27.105
And I'm going to give you,
the studio audience,
one hour to find him.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.107
Oh, not an hour!

38:29.174 --> 38:32.778
All right, not an hour.
A minute. I'll give you
60 seconds to find him.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.113
Help yourselves, everybody.
See if you can find him.

38:35.180 --> 38:37.449
- Open the bonnet.
- Look in the ashtray!

38:37.516 --> 38:40.652
Look in the ashtray?
He's small, but he's not
that small.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.422
- Open the boot.
- Inside the seat.

38:43.489 --> 38:44.723
"Inside the seat."

38:44.790 --> 38:46.658
He's strapped underneath.
He's underneath.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.927
- Have a look.
- I'll get down.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.729
If you just
go down there, you can
have a look underneath.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.864
Has anyone lifted this?

38:52.931 --> 38:55.200
Three, two, one...

38:55.266 --> 38:56.502
No, you've all failed.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.404
You'd be no good
in Immigration.

39:00.105 --> 39:03.742
Right, go back
to where you were, because,
ladies and gentlemen,

39:03.809 --> 39:06.645
what we are going to do now
is reveal to you

39:06.712 --> 39:10.315
where Richard Hammond
was concealed in this car.

39:10.416 --> 39:12.250
James,
could you give me a hand?

39:12.317 --> 39:14.853
-Certainly.
-Okey-doke.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.422
- Hello!
- There he is.

39:16.422 --> 39:20.058
Hello! I'm in the car. Yeah.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.896
Are you all right?

39:24.963 --> 39:26.798
Yeah. Can I get out now?

39:26.865 --> 39:30.235
The amazing thing is,
it's not just Audi TTs.

39:30.301 --> 39:33.071
Almost any car
has that much space

39:33.138 --> 39:35.441
if you want to do
a spot of people smuggling.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.909
Yeah, it's not that much
space, just to be clear.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.545
Can I get out now?

39:39.611 --> 39:42.648
No, because I've just
thought of something.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.450
No, seriously. James, could
you pop the bumper back on?

39:44.516 --> 39:46.051
-What?
-No, move your feet.

39:46.117 --> 39:48.687
-No, because--
-It's not very nice!

39:48.754 --> 39:51.757
Is it not? Right, so,
pop that back on there.

39:51.823 --> 39:54.359
Now, what we've
got here, I think,

39:54.460 --> 39:57.763
is a really rather
effective parking sensor.

39:57.829 --> 40:01.633
What?
I don't like this!
- I like it. I like it.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.636
You get back in. We'll bring
a car in so that...

40:04.703 --> 40:06.772
Yeah, so you've got
something to reverse up to.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.874
I need to drill some holes
for your eyes.

40:08.940 --> 40:12.410
- You bloody don't!

40:12.478 --> 40:15.547
Seriously, Hammond,
you won't be able to see
anything unless I do.

40:15.614 --> 40:18.650
-Where are your eyes?
About here?
-At the front of my head!

40:18.717 --> 40:20.786
Right, close them, Hammond.
This...

40:29.427 --> 40:31.963
-Hammond?
-I'm not talking to you!

40:33.932 --> 40:35.901
Right, I'll do one
for your other eye.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.939
There. Can you see out now?

40:42.007 --> 40:43.809
Yes, there. Look.
Can you see?

40:43.875 --> 40:47.112
We can see his little eyes.
That's lovely.
If someone holds this.

40:47.178 --> 40:49.815
Right, James, if you'd like
to start reversing,

40:49.881 --> 40:53.284
keeping your ears open for
Hammond's pitiable screams.

40:53.351 --> 40:54.753
Roger.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.288
No...
No! No! Just stop!

40:57.355 --> 40:59.057
No! Stop!

40:59.124 --> 41:01.893
- How far away is that?
- About 15 feet.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.395
- What?
- Hammond?

41:04.530 --> 41:06.064
- What?
- We live in London.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.200
- You could build a £4 million
house in that gap.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.236
I need to know when
you're half an inch away.

41:11.302 --> 41:14.172
You're not the one
in the bloody bumper!

41:14.239 --> 41:16.141
-Right, come on, then, James.
-Here we go.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.544
Hammond, you're on silence
till it's dangerous.

41:24.349 --> 41:26.251
Stop!

41:27.919 --> 41:30.556
That is absolutely brilliant.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.625
That's like
a quarter of an inch.

41:35.026 --> 41:37.195
Look at that.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.263
Cor!

41:39.731 --> 41:42.768
The thing is, parking sensors
are very expensive.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.970
You can rent a man
for almost nothing.

41:45.036 --> 41:48.306
Yeah, look, I don't know
how much you pay
to rent a man normally,

41:48.373 --> 41:50.241
but I cost more.

41:50.308 --> 41:52.210
Now, get me out of here,
please.

41:52.277 --> 41:54.980
Well, no, because we've got
to link into the next film.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.448
We can't get you out anyway

41:57.583 --> 41:59.217
because you're too close;
we'll never get the bumper off.

41:59.284 --> 42:02.220
- You're too good
at your job, Hammond.
Oh, God!

42:02.287 --> 42:04.389
That's what's happened.
So we're going back...

42:04.455 --> 42:07.893
Actually, it's part two,
isn't it? What was the film?

42:07.959 --> 42:10.095
It was Italy.
No, that was last week.

42:11.597 --> 42:13.599
- Oh, the cars!
- Oh, really?

42:13.665 --> 42:17.703
-Oh, the sustainable thing.
-Sustainable cars. So...
-Yes.

42:17.769 --> 42:22.841
Get on with it!

42:26.077 --> 42:28.614
The following morning
we were up bright and early

42:28.614 --> 42:31.016
so we could get back
to the start line.

42:34.319 --> 42:36.988
-Not a bad night, actually.
-It was all right.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.156
Oh, hello.

42:39.658 --> 42:41.860
May?

42:44.229 --> 42:47.198
Oh! That's dogs and foxes
and things, isn't it?

42:47.265 --> 42:49.701
Dogs have come
and eaten your car.

42:49.768 --> 42:51.803
They haven't eaten
it, they've destroyed it,

42:51.870 --> 42:54.706
which means I've got to
put it back together again.

42:56.241 --> 42:59.177
There are some spare parts
up there.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.346
Yeah, I think that
horse is looking very ill.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.881
It's got a very grey face.

43:02.948 --> 43:04.650
That's always a sign
of looking ill.

43:04.716 --> 43:06.818
Is your horse ill?

43:06.885 --> 43:08.053
-No.
-No?

43:08.119 --> 43:10.221
-No
-He'll last the day, then?

43:10.288 --> 43:11.322
Yeah.

43:13.291 --> 43:14.292
Damn it.

43:17.095 --> 43:19.865
It took all morning
to repair my car

43:19.931 --> 43:21.767
with stuff from
the butcher's shop,

43:21.833 --> 43:23.434
which meant it was lunchtime

43:23.501 --> 43:25.003
before we were
on our way back

43:25.070 --> 43:27.105
to see how James
was getting on.

43:29.908 --> 43:31.977
Jeremy, what's all that smoke
up ahead there?

43:33.344 --> 43:34.713
What smoke?

43:34.780 --> 43:37.749
That massive ball of smoke
in front of us, up front.

43:37.816 --> 43:39.818
I can't see it.
My hay fever's really bad.

43:39.885 --> 43:42.187
No, you can't see it because
you're trying to looking at it

43:42.253 --> 43:44.856
through a cow's butt hole.

43:44.923 --> 43:47.759
As it turned out,
the smoke was on account

43:47.826 --> 43:53.364
of James having
single-handedly restarted
the Industrial Revolution.

44:00.605 --> 44:01.707
What?

44:01.740 --> 44:03.408
-What are you doing?
-I'm making...

44:06.277 --> 44:12.483
The theory is...
we are reducing our impact
on the environment,

44:12.550 --> 44:13.584
but you've dug it up!

44:13.719 --> 44:14.953
It's not where anybody lives.

44:15.020 --> 44:16.722
It's just the countryside.
It's not doing anything.

44:16.755 --> 44:18.223
Is that a coal lorry?

44:18.289 --> 44:22.027
-Yes.
-The least environmental
thing on the entire earth.

44:22.093 --> 44:24.730
It's a lorry delivering coal.

44:24.796 --> 44:27.032
-So?
-Why do you need coal?

44:27.098 --> 44:29.000
-To fire up the kiln.
-What?

44:29.067 --> 44:31.369
The bricks have to be baked.
You can't just--

44:31.436 --> 44:35.440
-Hold on. So you're making
a car out of mud bricks?
-Yes.

44:35.506 --> 44:38.944
Are you gonna dig a canal
network to get in and out,
perhaps, with your coal?

44:39.010 --> 44:41.379
-That's quite a good idea.
-It isn't a good idea!

44:42.948 --> 44:45.283
Much
ruined countryside later,

44:45.350 --> 44:48.987
James's new car
was finally ready.

44:49.054 --> 44:51.823
Why are you dressed up
like an American footballer?

44:51.890 --> 44:53.925
Well, it's a prototype,

44:53.992 --> 44:55.994
and I'm a test pilot,
in effect.

44:56.061 --> 44:58.329
Test pilots wear
specialist equipment.

44:58.396 --> 45:00.766
But that looks
perfectly solid to me.

45:01.767 --> 45:03.769
That roof is...

45:03.802 --> 45:06.872
James, even given
the limitations of the
material you've used,

45:06.938 --> 45:08.206
your car looks crap.

45:08.273 --> 45:10.141
But look how it blends in
with the environment.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.376
Prince Charles
would love this.

45:11.442 --> 45:12.978
It doesn't blend in
with anything.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.781
There's no environment left -
you've dug it all up.

45:15.814 --> 45:18.649
- Right, can we finally go?
- Yes, you can.

45:18.784 --> 45:20.218
11 miles lie ahead.

45:20.285 --> 45:22.320
See you there.

45:24.956 --> 45:27.292
Ow!

45:33.031 --> 45:36.301
That is a complete
mystery, to be honest.

45:36.367 --> 45:37.903
It's not.

45:37.969 --> 45:40.471
It had an arched roof,
it had a keystone.

45:40.538 --> 45:42.640
There must be something
wrong with that mortar.

45:42.707 --> 45:46.477
Waiting for James
to mend his bodywork, again,

45:46.544 --> 45:50.148
meant my bodywork
started to go off.

45:52.317 --> 45:54.485
But, eventually,
he was ready.

45:59.891 --> 46:02.093
It's really rather pleasant.

46:02.160 --> 46:05.130
This is like being at home
with the windows open.

46:05.196 --> 46:09.100
Richard, meanwhile,
had added some floral
go-faster stripes,

46:09.167 --> 46:13.371
and I'd opened up
my cow's rectum
to improve the ventilation.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.176
We have had a few problems.

46:18.243 --> 46:21.913
We've only covered, yes,
two miles in two days,

46:21.980 --> 46:24.015
but here we are,

46:24.082 --> 46:26.852
as a threesome, going along.

46:32.891 --> 46:34.125
But then...

46:34.192 --> 46:36.227
It's a river,
and not a small one.

46:41.099 --> 46:43.234
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

46:46.872 --> 46:49.507
Oh, God.

46:49.574 --> 46:52.577
-Oh, your bricks
have fallen off, mate.
-Your bonnet's fallen off.

46:52.643 --> 46:55.546
Perfectly all right.
Redundancy's built into it.

46:55.613 --> 46:57.615
-Is it?
-Yeah.

46:57.682 --> 47:00.051
Since Richard
is the team bumpkin,

47:00.118 --> 47:02.587
we decided
he should go first.

47:04.489 --> 47:07.658
OK, well,
my community of people,
make for higher ground.

47:07.725 --> 47:09.560
Just climb.

47:09.627 --> 47:13.331
Hammond's ark made it
to the other side safely.

47:13.398 --> 47:15.133
Yeah!

47:15.200 --> 47:17.068
And then it was my go.

47:18.236 --> 47:20.438
I'm really deep here.

47:20.505 --> 47:21.940
Really, really deep.

47:22.007 --> 47:24.209
Oh, no! Cows leak!

47:24.275 --> 47:26.577
That's a terrible thing
to learn!

47:28.046 --> 47:31.149
However, I, too, made it
with relative ease.

47:31.216 --> 47:33.151
Eat my meat, Hammond!

47:34.152 --> 47:35.921
But then...

47:35.954 --> 47:37.655
Look at this.

47:37.722 --> 47:39.024
Tragic.

47:39.090 --> 47:42.827
An old man driving a low
garden wall into a river.

47:42.928 --> 47:45.997
Let's look on the bright side.
If this doesn't work
as a car,

47:46.064 --> 47:48.099
it will be very effective
as a dam.

47:52.070 --> 47:54.472
He's not doing it
quite as quickly as
you or I did it.

47:54.539 --> 47:56.574
Nor as aggressively,
nor as purposefully.

47:58.409 --> 48:01.412
His car is also riding a lot
lower than ours because
it weighs so much.

48:01.479 --> 48:04.182
I was getting very deep.
It may be leaking slightly.

48:07.118 --> 48:08.419
It's leaking a lot.

48:10.021 --> 48:13.391
Cack.
Chaps, I think I'm beached.

48:13.458 --> 48:16.094
I'm being honest,
there's not a great deal
we can do about it.

48:16.161 --> 48:18.029
You're in the river,
we're here.

48:18.096 --> 48:20.966
Right, if I go right a bit,

48:20.966 --> 48:23.568
I should... clear that...

48:23.634 --> 48:25.603
Oh, yes!

48:25.670 --> 48:28.506
-Oh, the...
-The side's just come off.
-Yeah, that's...

48:28.573 --> 48:31.576
So the mortar's dissolving
and the bricks
are just falling off.

48:31.642 --> 48:33.044
Yes.

48:35.046 --> 48:36.347
That's more gone.

48:36.414 --> 48:39.050
Oh, God!
The mortar's dissolving!

48:39.117 --> 48:41.686
He's just transporting
his own cameras along.

48:41.752 --> 48:43.221
That's all he's doing.

48:43.288 --> 48:44.422
Get off!

48:45.656 --> 48:48.159
Get off!

48:48.226 --> 48:50.561
Little spindly arms
throwing a brick.

48:52.998 --> 48:54.199
Help!

48:56.367 --> 48:58.536
We're gonna have to put him
out of his misery.

48:58.603 --> 49:02.173
We'll just
abandon him.
Do you think?

49:02.240 --> 49:03.708
What is the point of him?

49:03.774 --> 49:05.376
James, can you hear me?

49:05.443 --> 49:08.479
We've analysed the situation
and there is literally

49:08.546 --> 49:10.615
nothing we can do to help.
Nothing.

49:12.317 --> 49:14.685
Leaving James
in his dissolving car,

49:14.752 --> 49:18.623
we headed off to make camp
and get supper underway.

49:20.091 --> 49:22.360
Well, apart from your
rather tragic tents,

49:22.427 --> 49:26.164
-this isn't so bad.
-It's all right.

49:26.231 --> 49:27.765
It is amazing, isn't it?

49:27.832 --> 49:31.202
My car, the way it disappears
into that hedge,

49:31.269 --> 49:34.305
it's not just camouflage,
it is hedge.

49:34.372 --> 49:36.141
-It's gone.
-No, it is genuinely...

49:36.207 --> 49:39.710
Actually, I will agree,
yours is remarkable.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.582
Meanwhile, James's car
had shed so much weight

49:44.649 --> 49:47.152
that he was able
to get free...

49:47.218 --> 49:52.423
and start raping
the countryside again
to rebuild it.

49:52.490 --> 49:53.424
Bastards.

49:54.625 --> 49:55.560
Bastards.

49:57.595 --> 50:00.365
You know, what's incredible
about this -

50:00.431 --> 50:03.034
this sustainable living
we're doing -

50:03.034 --> 50:03.068
this sustainable living
we're doing -
is our barbecue is made
from bricks from James's car,

50:03.068 --> 50:07.272
is our barbecue is made
from bricks from James's car,

50:07.338 --> 50:10.575
the kindling and the
vegetables are from your car.

50:10.641 --> 50:13.744
Are you about
to tell me I'm eating...

50:13.811 --> 50:15.346
Back wing.

50:18.783 --> 50:22.087
-What?
-When you buy a steak,
it says "keep refrigerated".

50:22.153 --> 50:24.322
It doesn't say, "Stick
to the side of your car,

50:24.389 --> 50:26.324
leave in the sun,
then drive through a river."

50:31.762 --> 50:32.630
Whoa!

50:45.410 --> 50:48.313
James is making
such a racket, isn't he?

50:48.379 --> 50:50.981
It's worse than last time.

50:51.048 --> 50:55.019
The difference on this trip,
while he's been
tearing nature apart,

50:55.086 --> 50:57.488
I've never felt closer to it.

50:57.555 --> 51:00.725
Well, he's just messing
everything up. He always...

51:06.531 --> 51:08.233
Holy cow.

51:08.299 --> 51:10.135
-Hammond.
-What?

51:11.702 --> 51:12.737
That.

51:14.372 --> 51:16.307
What are you doing?

51:16.374 --> 51:18.209
He couldn't see it.
It's a hedge trimmer.

51:18.276 --> 51:21.512
That's my community,
you rural bastard!

51:22.947 --> 51:24.782
-Oh, my...
-Oh, God!

51:26.884 --> 51:28.886
The next morning,
to cheer up Hammond

51:28.953 --> 51:31.222
following the decimation
of his car

51:31.289 --> 51:34.192
and his woodland
animal community,

51:34.259 --> 51:35.626
I made breakfast.

51:37.162 --> 51:38.796
-Eat it.
-No!

51:38.863 --> 51:40.998
-Why not?
-Because it's going green!

51:41.065 --> 51:42.267
It's just a bit of door.

51:42.333 --> 51:44.535
You can see where the flies
have been on it.

51:44.602 --> 51:45.570
It's disgusting.

51:45.636 --> 51:47.605
Hello. Hello!

51:47.672 --> 51:48.539
What...?

51:49.807 --> 51:51.742
-It's a dung heap.
-It is a dung heap.

51:55.380 --> 51:56.981
-Morning.
-Morning.

51:57.047 --> 51:58.749
Is this a car? What is it?

51:58.816 --> 52:03.020
It is a totally sustainable
car made of, effectively,
wattle and daub,

52:03.188 --> 52:05.022
only the wattle
has been replaced by straw

52:05.089 --> 52:06.957
and the daub has been
replaced by cow poo,

52:07.024 --> 52:08.726
but the principle
is the same.

52:08.793 --> 52:11.329
How the hell
do you fit in it?
- Only just.

52:11.396 --> 52:13.831
-Where's your windscreen?
-There.

52:13.898 --> 52:14.765
Hang on.

52:16.267 --> 52:18.603
Can we just test
your blind spots, James?

52:18.669 --> 52:20.805
Can you see either of us now?

52:22.039 --> 52:23.508
No.

52:23.574 --> 52:26.311
Heavily pedestrianised areas
should be avoided.

52:29.046 --> 52:32.217
-Right, come on. We've just
got two miles to go.
-Yes.

52:33.284 --> 52:34.452
Jesus Christ!

52:34.519 --> 52:36.120
The smell!

52:36.221 --> 52:39.890
-What's that?
-It breaks my heart, but
it's a small gift for you.

52:39.957 --> 52:44.128
-Is it? Mate!
-Yes, from me and my
woodland community.

52:44.229 --> 52:45.463
Oh!

52:45.530 --> 52:48.132
-It's a dead bat!
-Yeah, it is.

52:48.233 --> 52:50.901
-Bats have sonar, don't they?
-Yeah.

52:50.968 --> 52:54.038
So I could use it as a
reversing parking sensor.

52:54.104 --> 52:56.674
Yeah, I don't think it works
once the bat is dead.

52:59.444 --> 53:01.546
And so,
with all of us running...

53:05.583 --> 53:08.052
My reversing bat
is working well.

53:08.118 --> 53:12.490
...we began
the final two-mile leg
of our epic journey.

53:13.991 --> 53:15.560
Oh, balls!

53:15.626 --> 53:19.264
There are some issues
associated with
environmentalism,

53:19.264 --> 53:21.832
and we're seeing
one of them right now.

53:27.672 --> 53:31.276
-Am I anywhere near the gate?
-Oh, God!

53:34.279 --> 53:39.317
James attempted to tie
his car back together
using a ball of string...

53:39.384 --> 53:40.751
which went well.

53:42.520 --> 53:44.589
It's going...

53:46.357 --> 53:49.294
Oh, that's gonna
confuse him now!

53:49.294 --> 53:52.630
Why'd they make it in a ball
shape? What a stupid idea!

53:54.299 --> 53:57.602
But eventually it was done
and we were on our way.

53:59.704 --> 54:02.507
James,
how much does it weigh now?

54:02.573 --> 54:06.877
I'm gonna say the weight
has gone down a bit. I think
I'm down to three tonnes.

54:06.944 --> 54:09.013
So you still need
an HGV licence?

54:09.079 --> 54:12.317
But it's not a type of car
known to the DVLA.

54:14.785 --> 54:17.555
Mind you,
I had even bigger problems.

54:17.622 --> 54:20.725
My car was starting
to smell really bad.

54:22.327 --> 54:23.628
One of the sound recordists

54:23.694 --> 54:25.496
just came to fiddle
with my microphone,

54:25.563 --> 54:27.031
and actually was sick.

54:28.633 --> 54:32.470
Eventually, though, our
destination hoved into view.

54:34.805 --> 54:37.542
After
three days gruelling travel

54:37.608 --> 54:40.345
over 11 miles, we're here.

54:41.946 --> 54:43.814
This must be it.

54:43.881 --> 54:48.018
It was the Inaugural
Sustainable Living
Motorsport Challenge

54:48.085 --> 54:51.789
on a track carved out of
nature itself.

54:52.957 --> 54:54.759
Oh, hang on.

54:56.361 --> 54:58.228
-A text message.
-What?

54:58.363 --> 54:59.630
I've got a text
here from Mr Wilman,

54:59.697 --> 55:01.599
with the instructions
of what we're doing.

55:01.666 --> 55:05.736
"Whoever does the most laps
in one hour wins."

55:05.803 --> 55:07.672
Oh, well, James,
that's not gonna be you.

55:07.738 --> 55:10.508
-Well, you don't know.
-No, I do know
it's not gonna be you.

55:10.575 --> 55:12.910
Oh, no, wait. Hang on.
"You will be racing against

55:12.977 --> 55:15.746
three old-fashioned
steel cars."

55:16.847 --> 55:18.949
-Hang on. Yes, those.
-Hello.

55:20.385 --> 55:22.620
- Oh, there they are.
- How quaint.

55:22.687 --> 55:24.722
No, they don't look
quaint. They look ridiculous.

55:24.789 --> 55:26.691
It's funny, that's
the nature of progress.

55:26.757 --> 55:29.059
- Suddenly, they look stupid.
- They do.

55:30.961 --> 55:35.433
The museum pieces were being
driven by three local yobbos.

55:37.001 --> 55:38.403
Right, this is it.

55:38.436 --> 55:42.473
The MeaTI, the TreeTI
and the PeaTI are ready.

55:48.078 --> 55:51.181
Oh, what a start!
It's a good start.

55:51.248 --> 55:53.283
Yes, we're blocking!

55:53.418 --> 55:57.054
Oh, they've gone!
They've gone!
I couldn't see the flag.

55:59.023 --> 56:02.427
Yes, there are some hay
bales. I'll follow those.

56:02.427 --> 56:05.029
Where the hell does it go
next?

56:05.095 --> 56:07.932
Despite the excellent start
from Richard and I,

56:07.998 --> 56:11.669
we were quickly overwhelmed
by the steel cars.

56:11.736 --> 56:14.505
And now the Golf's got past!

56:16.306 --> 56:17.908
Oh, no! Oh, no!

56:17.975 --> 56:20.445
I've let the Mondeo through.
That's a disaster!

56:21.612 --> 56:24.715
Oh, I've lost
one of my nose tampons!

56:24.782 --> 56:28.986
What Richard and I
really needed
was help from our colleague.

56:29.053 --> 56:31.456
Sadly, though...

56:31.456 --> 56:34.659
I'm gonna take
a racing line.
Oh, I'm completely lost.

56:34.725 --> 56:38.829
The trouble is,
the race track looks the same
as the front of the car.

56:38.896 --> 56:40.831
What a stupid idea
for an event.

56:43.100 --> 56:46.103
I've lost the other
nose tampon! Help!

56:47.472 --> 56:49.607
I may have to pit
for another tampon.

56:51.141 --> 56:52.477
Where am I going?

56:54.144 --> 56:56.046
All right, James?

56:56.113 --> 56:57.347
No.

56:57.482 --> 56:59.016
No time to lose.

57:02.119 --> 57:03.921
I've gone for
the super absorbent,

57:03.988 --> 57:06.557
slightly larger nose tampons,

57:06.624 --> 57:08.593
which I hope will last
a little longer.

57:13.030 --> 57:15.700
Given that we were in
an endurance race,

57:15.766 --> 57:19.003
our tactics so far
had been to protect our cars.

57:20.938 --> 57:23.808
Reliability,
that's what we need here.
That is everything.

57:23.874 --> 57:25.375
That's what matters most.

57:25.510 --> 57:29.079
But with the cars of the past
racking up so many laps,

57:29.146 --> 57:31.148
we had to get
the hammer down.

57:33.417 --> 57:35.520
The MeaTI
against the...

57:35.553 --> 57:39.890
whatever that is -
1.6 litre Golf.

57:39.957 --> 57:41.225
Yes!

57:41.291 --> 57:43.060
Yes! I've got him!

57:44.595 --> 57:47.231
Power sliding a hedge.

57:47.297 --> 57:48.999
Come on!

57:53.403 --> 57:55.540
Yes. Oh, yes.

57:58.743 --> 58:00.811
I think I've done a lap.

58:02.312 --> 58:06.551
With us three - well, two -
making good progress,

58:06.617 --> 58:10.254
the cars from the past
started to play dirty.

58:12.723 --> 58:14.892
That is out of order!
They are getting violent!

58:17.628 --> 58:19.830
Oh! Oh, no!

58:19.897 --> 58:21.599
I've lost a tampon again!

58:24.201 --> 58:25.703
Who was that?

58:25.770 --> 58:26.937
Think you can mess with us

58:27.004 --> 58:28.706
just because we like
trees, do you?

58:28.773 --> 58:31.776
That's out of order, mate.
You can't. Have that!

58:38.583 --> 58:40.718
The bone
is taking on the steel!

58:43.253 --> 58:45.255
Although
we were holding our own,

58:45.322 --> 58:49.193
the relentless pressure
started to take its toll
on our vehicles.

58:53.698 --> 58:55.232
I've lost
part of the hat.

58:58.268 --> 59:00.304
I can smell...

59:00.370 --> 59:01.939
What can I smell?

59:03.407 --> 59:05.643
Is that from the exhaust?

59:05.710 --> 59:10.014
With Hammond distracted
by the hot exhaust
burning his bodywork,

59:10.080 --> 59:12.282
it was all down
to my cow car.

59:15.786 --> 59:20.791
Good dicing here between
the past and the future.

59:20.858 --> 59:23.227
It's neck and neck!

59:24.494 --> 59:26.130
But then...

59:26.196 --> 59:27.632
Oh, no! No!

59:28.733 --> 59:29.900
Disaster!

59:29.967 --> 59:31.702
Oh, hell.
I think it looks like

59:31.769 --> 59:32.970
Jeremy's got trouble.

59:34.939 --> 59:36.641
How do you peel a cow?

59:38.242 --> 59:41.045
Having eventually got to
the overheating engine

59:41.111 --> 59:45.249
and seen it had become
a production line
for maggots...

59:45.315 --> 59:47.818
...I decided to go off
and be sick.

59:51.188 --> 59:56.160
Er... News from the Inaugural
Sustainable Motorsport Event

59:56.226 --> 59:58.562
On A Sustainable Track,
or whatever it's called,

59:58.663 --> 1:00:02.032
Jeremy Clarkson has retired
with a maggot infestation.

1:00:03.801 --> 1:00:07.271
This meant
all our hopes rested
with Richard Hammond

1:00:07.337 --> 1:00:08.939
and his smouldering ark.

1:00:11.909 --> 1:00:13.678
Yeah, you ran wide!

1:00:13.744 --> 1:00:15.512
But then...

1:00:15.579 --> 1:00:16.881
Oh, my God!

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:19.684
Oh, no!

1:00:21.819 --> 1:00:26.123
Oh, no! More news from the
Sustainable Motorsport
Challenge is that... Ow!

1:00:26.190 --> 1:00:29.326
...Richard Hammond,
I believe, is on fire.

1:00:29.393 --> 1:00:31.028
The garden centre is ablaze.

1:00:32.629 --> 1:00:35.132
Oh, God! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1:00:37.401 --> 1:00:38.803
That's gonna make it worse!

1:00:41.105 --> 1:00:43.007
With Hammond's car
on fire...

1:00:44.441 --> 1:00:48.445
mine alive, and James's
disintegrating again...

1:00:48.512 --> 1:00:50.147
Ow! Ow!

1:00:50.214 --> 1:00:54.251
...we decided that
environmentalism
simply doesn't work.

1:00:55.485 --> 1:00:58.055
And with that, back to--

1:00:58.122 --> 1:01:00.290
And with that,
back to the tent.

1:01:02.993 --> 1:01:04.194
Holy crap!

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:13.203
-No, it didn't work.
-No. So, there we are.

1:01:15.740 --> 1:01:17.107
There we are,
we've looked into it.

1:01:17.174 --> 1:01:18.575
We've looked into it
thoroughly,

1:01:18.642 --> 1:01:22.079
and I'm afraid
we're all doomed,
we're all gonna die.

1:01:22.146 --> 1:01:25.649
And on that terrible
disappointment,
I'm afraid it's time to end.

1:01:25.750 --> 1:01:27.251
See you next week. Goodbye!
