00:02.693 --> 00:06.564
and some scenes which some
viewers may find upsetting.

00:13.779 --> 00:15.498
Found you.

00:15.499 --> 00:17.178
Didn't know you were looking.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.478
Didn't realise you were leaving.

00:19.379 --> 00:20.779
Just for the weekend.

00:44.819 --> 00:47.378
Were you expecting money for that?

00:47.379 --> 00:49.139
I'll settle for appreciation.

00:53.699 --> 00:55.859
A vent shaft?

00:57.339 --> 01:01.018
I thought it might be
how he got away and... Yeah.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.339
What about the front door?

01:11.459 --> 01:13.418
Tat Picot.

01:13.419 --> 01:15.458
Exactly.

01:15.459 --> 01:17.960
Our little
ex-French security operative...

01:18.850 --> 01:21.089
leaving your 'otel.

01:21.090 --> 01:23.489
- When?
- Not long before you...

01:23.490 --> 01:25.800
locked horns with the manager.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.409
He thought I was crazy.

01:28.410 --> 01:29.970
Whatever gave him that idea?

01:31.010 --> 01:33.649
Although finding you semiconscious,
covered in blood,

01:33.650 --> 01:37.009
and mouthing off about a ghoul
stuck in his air conditioning

01:37.010 --> 01:41.369
might have momentarily
confused his judgment.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.010
But it's all right.

01:45.370 --> 01:48.370
Our friend just managed to spook you.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.850
Which can only mean one thing.

01:52.490 --> 01:53.810
You hit a nerve.

04:32.570 --> 04:33.929
You eaten?

04:33.930 --> 04:35.840
Thinking about it.

04:36.330 --> 04:38.369
- You?
- No.

04:38.370 --> 04:40.201
Got something to do in the morning.

04:40.202 --> 04:42.000
Yeah? What?

04:42.402 --> 04:46.961
So, I'm going to try and get this
judge to subpoena our Mr Picot

04:46.962 --> 04:49.921
to appear before him.

04:49.922 --> 04:52.281
- You think he'll do it?
- He should.

04:52.282 --> 04:55.442
He's the investigating magistrate
and he's heard both sides.

04:56.482 --> 04:58.160
He seemed keen to.

04:58.562 --> 05:01.601
Except we're talking
the French Secret Service here.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.280
Except we're not.

05:03.962 --> 05:06.721
Interesting thing about this Picot fella,

05:06.722 --> 05:09.001
he was sacked from the Secret Service

05:09.002 --> 05:12.401
at exactly the same time
as the first judge was retired.

05:12.402 --> 05:15.721
You think there's been a change of guard?

05:15.722 --> 05:17.042
Yes, I do.

05:18.722 --> 05:20.961
And they're using us
to weed the old ones out?

05:20.962 --> 05:24.601
Well, would be interesting to see
if anyone else offers us any help.

05:35.882 --> 05:37.601
Yes?

05:37.602 --> 05:40.441
You want to know what happened
to that priest?

05:40.442 --> 05:41.881
Who is this?

05:41.882 --> 05:43.082
I can show you.

05:44.402 --> 05:46.040
OK. Where?

05:46.762 --> 05:48.721
Paris catacombs.

05:48.722 --> 05:50.881
- Catacombs?
- Two hours.

05:50.882 --> 05:53.321
No, I'm not comfortable with that.

05:53.322 --> 05:56.121
- You are afraid?
- Well, yeah. Duh.

05:56.122 --> 05:57.562
That I will hurt you?

05:59.242 --> 06:01.321
Why do you say that?

06:01.322 --> 06:04.201
You are staying in room 219.

06:04.202 --> 06:06.162
The lock is easily slippable.

06:07.362 --> 06:10.201
You walked through a subway
last night alone.

06:10.202 --> 06:12.041
So, if I wanted to hurt you...

06:12.042 --> 06:14.481
Why? Why are you watching me?

06:14.482 --> 06:16.841
Because you are in danger.

06:16.842 --> 06:18.481
Who from?

06:18.482 --> 06:19.602
Everyone.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.761
I won't come alone.

06:24.762 --> 06:28.202
You are alone.
That is why I have to help you.

06:31.601 --> 06:32.921
How will I find you?

06:33.642 --> 06:35.761
I have found you already.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.801
Please leave a message after the tone.

06:53.962 --> 06:58.081
Michael, I just had
a very weird call from a guy.

06:58.082 --> 06:59.322
Says he can help.

07:00.782 --> 07:02.182
Says I'm in danger.

07:03.655 --> 07:04.935
C-Call me back.

07:08.722 --> 07:11.921
Hello, Michael.
Here we go again. You ready?

07:11.922 --> 07:14.921
For the chance to piss blood for
the next two weeks? Who wouldn't be?

07:14.922 --> 07:17.600
You'll be home by tea-time.

07:18.042 --> 07:19.322
And dead in a year.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.241
Give me some credit.

07:21.242 --> 07:22.722
Give me six months.

07:25.004 --> 07:26.484
Please.

07:26.509 --> 07:27.749
You'll be fine.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.641
- You've said that before.
- Yes.

07:31.642 --> 07:32.962
And you're still here.

07:41.282 --> 07:44.122
Michael. This is my third message.

07:45.162 --> 07:48.042
I'm here now
and not totally sure what to do.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.802
Give me a call.

09:07.442 --> 09:09.202
I did not think you would come.

09:11.522 --> 09:13.097
Then you're a man who makes mistakes.

09:13.122 --> 09:14.761
Yeah.

09:14.762 --> 09:15.802
Many.

09:19.882 --> 09:22.201
And, er... what is this?

09:22.202 --> 09:24.002
You do your laptop work here, too?

09:28.082 --> 09:31.760
Millions of people down here, maybe six.

09:32.821 --> 09:33.861
You know that?

09:34.882 --> 09:37.321
Sorry. With all the cloak and dagger,

09:37.322 --> 09:39.401
I forgot to pick up
a fact sheet on my way down.

09:39.402 --> 09:42.921
Almost as many were killed in the
Congolese wars. Did you know that?

09:42.922 --> 09:45.601
Well, no-one knows
exactly how many for sure.

09:45.602 --> 09:46.842
Or cares.

09:50.402 --> 09:51.602
We stop here.

09:59.155 --> 10:00.915
If only the dead could talk?

10:02.042 --> 10:03.762
What do you think they would say?

10:05.962 --> 10:08.882
"Hurry up, we've got a steam punk
convention here at midday"?

10:13.042 --> 10:15.240
Nothing you have been told is true.

10:15.722 --> 10:16.920
Nothing.

10:17.442 --> 10:21.320
Everything you have heard is a lie,
from everyone.

10:22.682 --> 10:23.882
Everyone.

10:33.609 --> 10:34.849
Accept these.

10:36.722 --> 10:39.480
The priest, Father Patenaude.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.208
He's alive.

11:04.922 --> 11:08.721
Gloria Patri, et Filio,
et Spiritui Sancto.

11:08.722 --> 11:14.641
Sicut erat in principio, et nunc,
et semper, et in saecula saeculorum.

11:20.802 --> 11:22.121
Amen.

12:12.042 --> 12:14.081
Regarde!

12:14.082 --> 12:16.521
Look at what I've done.

12:16.522 --> 12:18.602
Look at what I've done!

13:02.562 --> 13:04.240
Is this your son?

13:05.242 --> 13:06.682
Elle veut savoir si c'est Pascal.

13:09.402 --> 13:11.760
No, je pas certain.

13:12.322 --> 13:13.721
Je ne peux pas dire. Je sais pas.

13:13.722 --> 13:15.682
She cannot tell.

13:16.882 --> 13:18.907
I know this must be very distressing.

13:18.932 --> 13:19.958
Desole.

13:19.959 --> 13:22.722
But if there's anything
about this man you recognise...

13:24.082 --> 13:26.081
Elle veut que vous regarder a nouveau.

13:26.082 --> 13:27.601
Certainement que vraiment pas?

13:27.602 --> 13:29.681
No, je sais pas.

13:29.682 --> 13:32.121
Je sais pas, je sais pas.

13:32.122 --> 13:33.880
Je sais pas.

13:34.322 --> 13:37.401
Please, my aunt is not well.
This is not good for her.

13:37.402 --> 13:39.201
Please. Please, if you can...

13:39.202 --> 13:40.882
No, please, enough!

14:18.522 --> 14:19.722
I'm sorry.

14:21.682 --> 14:23.282
You don't recognise him?

14:24.562 --> 14:29.762
I recognise all who answer
the call of Saint Benedict.

14:31.602 --> 14:33.602
But this one individually?

14:35.042 --> 14:37.801
In the brotherhood, we are all one.

14:37.802 --> 14:39.681
Is that why you're protecting him?

14:39.682 --> 14:40.722
Who?

14:43.722 --> 14:45.042
Pascal Patenaude.

14:49.635 --> 14:52.475
You'd have to lie to answer that,
wouldn't you?

14:57.160 --> 14:59.081
Actually...

14:59.082 --> 15:01.001
in er...

15:01.002 --> 15:04.400
Exodus 119...

15:05.242 --> 15:09.841
- the midwives lie to the Pharaoh.
- To save the children.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.560
Yes, yes.

15:12.442 --> 15:13.962
You know your Scripture.

15:14.839 --> 15:16.159
No.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.962
Then, how...?

15:21.849 --> 15:24.080
I don't know, I just... knew...

15:27.002 --> 15:32.081
The Lord... is always here.

15:32.082 --> 15:34.960
And here, always.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.122
Not in mine.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.602
Not me, I kicked him out a long time ago.

15:52.446 --> 15:56.440
No-one is beyond the reach of the
Almighty, mademoiselle.

15:58.402 --> 16:00.961
Or the law, Monsieur Abbott...

16:00.962 --> 16:03.362
if you are found to be obstructing it.

16:05.522 --> 16:07.041
Why are you so...?

16:07.042 --> 16:08.400
Angry?

16:08.802 --> 16:10.760
Suspicious?

16:11.482 --> 16:13.202
- Of you?
- Yes.

16:14.908 --> 16:16.788
I'm a genocide survivor.

16:20.895 --> 16:22.655
Rwanda?

16:23.522 --> 16:26.722
I'm told I was found outside
one of your churches.

16:27.048 --> 16:28.488
One of mine?

16:31.282 --> 16:34.961
No-one is beyond the reach of the
Almighty, Abbott.

16:34.962 --> 16:38.441
Although of the hundreds they found
in there, apparently

16:38.442 --> 16:39.962
I was the only one alive.

16:47.989 --> 16:49.669
I see.

16:52.042 --> 16:53.921
If you really did...

16:53.922 --> 16:56.202
you would help me identify that man.

18:14.168 --> 18:15.888
And your flight was OK?

18:17.928 --> 18:19.608
And your hotel?

18:22.842 --> 18:26.041
I'm so sorry we had to fly you all
the way over here but

18:26.042 --> 18:29.281
I have a medical condition which
means I can't travel

18:29.282 --> 18:32.001
long distances at the moment.

18:32.002 --> 18:35.841
And I understand you have a very
interesting story to tell us.

18:35.842 --> 18:40.760
- It is not a story. She is a witness.
- Of course.

18:41.722 --> 18:45.241
I'm so very sorry that you have to
revisit such a dreadful

18:45.242 --> 18:50.081
part of your past... but we're
so very grateful

18:50.082 --> 18:51.642
that you are willing to do it.

18:53.082 --> 18:54.562
So, please...

18:55.282 --> 18:56.762
whenever you're ready...

18:59.082 --> 19:01.042
You realise she cannot speak?

19:03.202 --> 19:06.760
- Yes.
- She has not spoken since that day.

19:10.162 --> 19:13.441
Since April the eighth, 1994?

19:13.442 --> 19:15.480
The first days of the genocide?

19:16.002 --> 19:17.520
But she can sign.

19:18.042 --> 19:20.482
A British charity taught her,
I will interpret.

19:21.802 --> 19:23.170
That is OK?

19:23.195 --> 19:26.066
That is exactly the reason
I've asked you here today.

19:29.362 --> 19:30.722
Where do you want to start?

19:32.588 --> 19:34.228
You were 11 years old?

19:35.328 --> 19:36.728
A Tutsi?

19:37.582 --> 19:40.542
You and your family sought shelter
from the killings

19:40.567 --> 19:42.887
in the Church of the Grey Fathers,

19:42.962 --> 19:45.362
the one run by Father Patenaude. Correct?

19:48.122 --> 19:49.400
So...

19:49.842 --> 19:51.880
wherever you want to start...

19:54.095 --> 19:56.415
what happened to you, Juliana?

20:03.275 --> 20:06.000
I was born...

20:07.995 --> 20:10.035
in Sake.

20:12.362 --> 20:15.520
Beside the lake.

20:19.162 --> 20:23.442
I had one brother...

20:25.282 --> 20:27.762
and two sisters.

20:30.475 --> 20:34.160
My father was a farmer.

20:35.722 --> 20:38.482
Our field was our world.

20:40.718 --> 20:45.240
The sun shone, the water fell.

20:46.642 --> 20:49.122
The crops grew.

20:51.240 --> 20:57.120
Everything that came, also it would go.

20:59.042 --> 21:03.360
And then... it would come again.

21:06.082 --> 21:07.640
Until one day...

21:09.562 --> 21:11.440
the thing that came...

21:13.442 --> 21:15.400
it would never leave.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.801
That night...

22:56.802 --> 22:59.122
I ran...

22:59.440 --> 23:00.882
to the lake...

23:02.822 --> 23:06.280
and hid amongst the reeds.

23:09.202 --> 23:11.362
And did you see Father Patenaude again?

23:13.602 --> 23:15.160
Yes.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.682
Thank you.

23:59.042 --> 24:01.680
Why ask me, when I cannot speak?

24:06.842 --> 24:09.240
Because words would fail.

24:18.922 --> 24:22.321
Just leaving you a
message, returning your call.

24:22.322 --> 24:25.121
It's not a problem but...

24:25.122 --> 24:27.921
if you could leave me a
call to confirm,

24:27.922 --> 24:29.481
it would be great...

24:29.482 --> 24:32.842
07700900864...

24:35.922 --> 24:41.641
Next message.
Message received today at 10.05am.

24:41.642 --> 24:44.041
This is Mrs Beattie, Eve's sister...

24:44.042 --> 24:46.482
I'm hoping someone might be
able to help me...

24:53.400 --> 24:55.761
So, what do we do?

24:55.762 --> 24:57.082
Throw them in.

24:58.722 --> 25:00.082
Is that what you did to her?

25:01.541 --> 25:04.360
Yes. Here?

25:06.481 --> 25:07.961
At low tide.

25:09.135 --> 25:10.535
Amongst all this...

25:11.722 --> 25:13.531
- Life?
- Yes.

25:14.562 --> 25:16.880
It's a terrible thing to do to
a human body.

25:17.887 --> 25:18.927
Why?

25:18.952 --> 25:21.680
Because we need our bodies
for the resurrection.

25:23.602 --> 25:25.081
Really?

25:25.082 --> 25:27.160
Is that really right, Sorcha?

25:28.242 --> 25:31.921
So, which bit will, you know, say,
Alfred the Great get to use,

25:31.922 --> 25:34.281
because, I'm guessing by now,
most of him is part of the

25:34.282 --> 25:35.242
Winchester Bypass...

25:35.267 --> 25:36.786
- Don't be cheap!
- I'm not.

25:38.042 --> 25:39.202
I'm just being...

25:40.520 --> 25:41.631
factual.

25:41.656 --> 25:44.961
Where I come from, what you
believe is who you are,

25:44.962 --> 25:47.361
if you don't believe,
you are not complete.

25:47.362 --> 25:49.634
I think if you'd seen what your
sister saw in Rwanda,

25:49.635 --> 25:52.920
- you might think differently.
- It wasn't God's fault.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.776
You didn't see what
happened in his churches.

25:57.801 --> 25:58.822
No.

25:59.602 --> 26:01.761
God's word is clear,

26:01.762 --> 26:03.801
Thou shalt not kill.

26:03.802 --> 26:06.322
It's only when men fail to obey His word

26:06.347 --> 26:07.935
that these dreadful things happen.

26:08.422 --> 26:11.921
Men razed those churches,
men killed your family,

26:11.922 --> 26:13.921
not God, men.

26:13.922 --> 26:16.921
And those are the men Eve was
prosecuting.

26:16.922 --> 26:19.122
Then, she should have given
herself up too.

26:21.442 --> 26:23.040
Why?

26:23.722 --> 26:25.560
What did she tell you about us?

26:27.688 --> 26:30.448
- About what?
- Why we didn't speak.

26:31.282 --> 26:32.641
She'd lost her faith.

26:32.642 --> 26:34.042
Not "it"!

26:36.362 --> 26:38.001
Her accent, then.

26:38.002 --> 26:40.321
She was a bright girl,
she got herself a scholarship.

26:40.322 --> 26:42.482
- And she got out.
- No shame in that.

26:44.315 --> 26:46.075
Then "in" what?

26:48.528 --> 26:50.328
She had herself an abortion.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.755
You didn't know?

27:07.842 --> 27:09.909
- When?
- I knew I shouldn't have come.

27:09.934 --> 27:12.740
- No, when, tell me when.
- Before you.

27:19.922 --> 27:22.040
- And she, and she told you?
- No.

27:23.362 --> 27:27.761
The doctors... She got an infection
and I was next of kin,

27:27.762 --> 27:30.240
seeing as how she wasn't married,
an' all.

27:30.682 --> 27:33.560
They wanted me to come but I couldn't.

27:38.162 --> 27:39.842
Or wouldn't?

27:44.402 --> 27:46.041
She was your sister.

27:46.042 --> 27:47.682
And it was my niece she murdered.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.821
Sorcha...

27:54.875 --> 27:56.475
So there it is, then...

27:59.602 --> 28:01.561
Did you get my postal orders?

28:01.562 --> 28:03.600
- I sent one every Christmas.
- Yes.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.322
Thank you.

28:09.162 --> 28:11.320
It wasn't about you, you know.

28:12.482 --> 28:15.600
If you were my kin, I would have
loved you with all my heart.

28:19.808 --> 28:21.528
I am.

28:31.282 --> 28:32.882
Darling...

28:33.962 --> 28:35.320
you're not.

28:36.162 --> 28:37.802
Blood is blood.

28:39.522 --> 28:41.201
She murdered mine.

28:41.202 --> 28:43.560
I could never forgive her for it.

28:46.175 --> 28:47.975
She took it to her grave.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.015
And so will I.

29:45.602 --> 29:46.642
You found it.

29:49.002 --> 29:51.681
Guess this must be how the
Victorians felt.

29:51.682 --> 29:53.082
Before it all went to shit.

29:55.322 --> 29:56.601
Good weekend?

29:56.602 --> 29:58.041
I haven't stopped laughing.

29:58.042 --> 30:00.520
Me neither. This case...

30:01.762 --> 30:04.400
Better than a box set of Seinfeld.

30:07.562 --> 30:10.242
- Can I ask you something?
- Not about Seinfeld.

30:11.282 --> 30:16.081
Really funny one was the guy that
came before. What was his name?

30:16.082 --> 30:18.081
Ran a chat show.

30:18.082 --> 30:19.280
Do you keep secrets?

30:21.202 --> 30:23.640
- From who?
- From me.

30:25.842 --> 30:27.082
About what?

30:29.075 --> 30:30.955
Did you know Eve had a termination?

30:31.882 --> 30:34.520
- When?
- Just before me.

30:35.802 --> 30:36.922
Yes, I did.

30:44.242 --> 30:45.642
Do you know why?

30:46.642 --> 30:48.320
But you'd like me to guess.

30:52.202 --> 30:54.441
Right relationship, wrong time.

30:54.442 --> 30:56.560
- With who?
- Ed Holt.

31:00.722 --> 31:01.762
When?

31:03.682 --> 31:06.241
Just after the genocide.

31:06.242 --> 31:11.321
They'd both gone to Rwanda,
and it was all very unfortunate.

31:11.322 --> 31:14.961
I wouldn't have heard about it,
but there were complications.

31:14.962 --> 31:16.322
She got very ill.

31:22.482 --> 31:24.041
Before me.

31:24.042 --> 31:26.881
Don't be thinking you were
some kind of a guilt thing.

31:26.882 --> 31:31.040
Your mother would have taken you on
no matter what. I'm sure of that.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.200
It just made you that much more special.

31:37.082 --> 31:40.162
Jerry... Gary...

31:40.682 --> 31:42.322
Fuck was his name?

31:43.042 --> 31:44.802
Why do you think she didn't tell me?

31:46.255 --> 31:47.615
Who did?

31:49.722 --> 31:50.801
Her sister.

31:50.802 --> 31:54.481
God's own praetorian guard, right?

31:54.482 --> 31:57.480
Nothing can happen if
it's not in His name.

31:58.682 --> 32:00.641
Let me tell you something about her.

32:00.642 --> 32:04.841
During the Troubles, she had so many
IRA guns under her bed

32:04.842 --> 32:07.481
it's a miracle she could walk
in the morning.

32:07.482 --> 32:11.121
And when your mother became
a prosecutor, the old boys,

32:11.122 --> 32:15.041
they started to lean on her,
to get her to help them out.

32:15.042 --> 32:18.002
As much as anything that's why
your mother never went back.

32:19.002 --> 32:22.721
And, more than anything else, that's
why her sister never forgave her.

32:22.722 --> 32:24.722
The termination was just the excuse.

32:25.802 --> 32:29.601
Sorcha Beattie was a nationalist
down to her marrow.

32:29.602 --> 32:33.680
Once you know that,
you know everything about her.

32:34.242 --> 32:37.481
And that's what we need to find
out about this case.

32:37.482 --> 32:40.121
What this prosecution is really about.

32:40.122 --> 32:42.282
Cos that old monk, he's just the excuse.

32:45.602 --> 32:49.202
So... I got given this this morning.

32:54.722 --> 32:55.841
Who by?

32:55.842 --> 32:58.960
Couriered over to the office,
PO box pick up.

32:59.682 --> 33:02.040
I'm thinking it's your graveyard friend.

33:04.202 --> 33:07.002
Whoever it is,
it's our second wish granted.

33:07.322 --> 33:09.082
So we'd better make it count.

33:44.728 --> 33:46.208
My mother.

33:54.882 --> 33:56.282
She's very beautiful.

33:58.282 --> 33:59.960
So I am forever told.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.682
And that's my brother.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.560
He's in the Army.

34:09.282 --> 34:10.562
Was.

34:14.681 --> 34:17.360
Do you wonder why there is no
picture of me?

34:23.641 --> 34:25.440
Because I'm not dead.

34:26.242 --> 34:29.120
My father only worships what he has lost.

34:32.947 --> 34:34.348
He'll see you now.

34:44.402 --> 34:48.681
- I'm glad you came back.
- Why?

34:48.681 --> 34:50.561
I wanted to apologise.

34:50.562 --> 34:53.561
Last time I think I may have seemed

34:53.562 --> 34:56.762
insensitive to your personal tragedy.

34:57.042 --> 34:58.442
This isn't about me.

35:00.162 --> 35:03.401
Despite what happened to you,
this is purely professional?

35:03.402 --> 35:05.720
I'm only here on behalf of
Alice Munezero.

35:07.282 --> 35:08.322
To do what?

35:09.295 --> 35:12.095
Establish her innocence.

35:14.190 --> 35:17.081
Yes, that is me, with Patrice Ganimana,

35:17.082 --> 35:20.921
taken in Rwanda about 27 years ago.

35:20.922 --> 35:23.322
A man accused of complicity
with genocide.

35:24.522 --> 35:28.481
But at the time a serving officer
in a legitimate government army.

35:28.482 --> 35:32.402
Which later went on to support
a genocidal regime.

35:34.242 --> 35:36.561
- We've had this conversation.
- We have.

35:36.562 --> 35:39.200
And I'm not convinced by your argument.

35:39.602 --> 35:41.441
I didn't think this was about you.

35:41.442 --> 35:45.920
It's not. It's about him.

35:46.682 --> 35:50.760
Yes. That's Picot.

35:53.122 --> 35:56.162
- You know him.
- Yes.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.041
How?

35:58.042 --> 36:00.202
When I was working for the Elysee,

36:00.640 --> 36:03.200
I was assigned a personal security agent.

36:03.842 --> 36:05.441
Him.

36:05.442 --> 36:07.032
You realise we can connect him

36:07.057 --> 36:09.521
to both key witnesses
against Alice Munezero?

36:09.522 --> 36:12.721
I should imagine you can.
Once we launched this case

36:12.722 --> 36:16.041
it was his job to extract them
both from Rwanda.

36:16.042 --> 36:18.081
- Why?
- To protect them.

36:18.082 --> 36:20.481
- Who from?
- Anyone who didn't...

36:20.482 --> 36:23.160
who DOESN'T want them to speak.

36:25.522 --> 36:27.240
I was attacked by him.

36:29.162 --> 36:30.561
Really?

36:32.242 --> 36:33.442
Why?

36:36.602 --> 36:39.880
Did you try and interfere
with the witnesses?

36:40.882 --> 36:42.561
I spoke to them.

36:42.562 --> 36:45.680
But had they asked to speak to you?

36:48.882 --> 36:50.122
Then what do you expect?

36:51.362 --> 36:54.279
The Tutsi government of
which your client is a part

36:54.304 --> 36:55.706
has a little black book.

36:56.762 --> 36:58.641
Did you know that?

36:58.642 --> 37:00.401
No. No, I didn't.

37:00.402 --> 37:01.842
And...

37:03.162 --> 37:07.921
anyone who speaks up against them
will be on that list.

37:07.922 --> 37:10.481
I should imagine they are near the top.

37:10.482 --> 37:12.282
I know I am.

37:14.562 --> 37:18.201
And seeing as we are playing top trumps,

37:18.202 --> 37:21.560
I think I have a better card than you.

37:24.362 --> 37:27.042
This is the world you are defending.

37:31.722 --> 37:33.400
Who took it?

37:36.882 --> 37:38.560
- Personally?
- Oui.

37:40.362 --> 37:42.041
When?

37:42.042 --> 37:44.681
Le 25 juin 1994.

37:44.682 --> 37:48.720
In English, please,
for the benefit of the defence.

37:53.160 --> 37:57.802
I took this photo on the 25th
of June 1994.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.561
And...

38:01.562 --> 38:05.921
why were you in Rwanda at that time?

38:05.922 --> 38:09.081
My unit was part of Operation Turquoise,

38:09.082 --> 38:12.165
a humanitarian effort on
behalf of the French army

38:12.190 --> 38:14.521
to help bring the genocide to a close.

38:14.522 --> 38:16.656
Well, that's contentious.

38:16.657 --> 38:20.200
Mademoiselle, please. I only wish
to hear from the witness.

38:21.722 --> 38:24.721
Thank you. Continuez. Continue.

38:24.722 --> 38:28.721
We had heard there was a French
national, Father Patenaude,

38:28.722 --> 38:30.321
stranded in rebel territory.

38:30.322 --> 38:31.561
Rebel terr...?!

38:31.562 --> 38:33.841
Again, I'm sorry, this is a very
contentious comment.

38:33.842 --> 38:35.721
You are not free to
cross examine the witness.

38:35.722 --> 38:37.321
This is not the UK here.

38:38.442 --> 38:42.121
But please, for the record,
there is an argument that the true

38:42.122 --> 38:44.681
purpose of Operation Turquoise
was to help perpetrators of

38:44.682 --> 38:48.401
genocide escape in the face of
an advancing Tutsi army who was,

38:48.402 --> 38:51.602
of itself, singularly responsible
for stopping the genocide.

38:54.002 --> 38:56.680
If you speak again I will
have you removed.

39:00.002 --> 39:03.722
Excusez-nous. I apologise. Continue.

39:05.282 --> 39:09.761
We took a helicopter and flew into
the village where he was said to be.

39:09.762 --> 39:12.921
And that is what we found.

39:12.922 --> 39:15.440
- Patenaude's remains.
- Yes.

39:17.642 --> 39:19.161
When was this?

39:19.162 --> 39:25.201
A week after Munezero's rebel army
unit passed through the area.

39:25.202 --> 39:26.521
Alice Munezero.

39:26.522 --> 39:28.002
Yes.

39:30.162 --> 39:35.281
How can you be sure this is
Patenaude's remains?

39:35.282 --> 39:38.140
Apart from what you see?

39:38.165 --> 39:40.161
The villagers confirmed it.

39:40.162 --> 39:43.961
- As they did the cause.
- Which was?

39:43.962 --> 39:47.362
That he was shot in cold blood
by Alice Munezero.

39:48.642 --> 39:51.965
And I say that with the
full weight of my authority

39:51.990 --> 39:53.586
as a General De Brigade.

39:57.442 --> 40:00.802
You've got to button up, Kate,
that's the way to do things here.

40:05.522 --> 40:07.402
I know him.

40:12.362 --> 40:13.960
I've seen him before.

40:16.162 --> 40:18.320
Do you know Jacques Antoine Barre?

40:18.762 --> 40:21.120
The man who started this case.

40:22.421 --> 40:23.461
Non.

40:24.682 --> 40:27.401
But you do know his son.

40:27.402 --> 40:28.841
Pardon?

40:28.842 --> 40:30.560
He was in the Army with you.

40:31.562 --> 40:34.120
I've seen a photograph of you together.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.762
I mean, you are younger, but, yes.

40:38.875 --> 40:40.435
It's definitely you.

40:41.242 --> 40:42.921
Non.

40:42.922 --> 40:44.880
- No.
- It's not possible.

40:48.242 --> 40:49.442
But it is.

41:16.361 --> 41:17.561
And here you are again.

41:34.002 --> 41:35.602
Last time I was...

41:42.962 --> 41:44.762
Last time I was here...

41:47.295 --> 41:48.735
there was a picture.

41:52.722 --> 41:54.521
You changed it.

41:54.522 --> 41:55.562
No.

42:04.442 --> 42:06.761
- You changed it.
- No.

42:06.762 --> 42:08.882
Yes! Because I'm right!

42:16.242 --> 42:19.361
This is perverting the course of justice.

42:19.362 --> 42:22.641
Only in your mind.
You are clearly very disturbed.

42:22.642 --> 42:23.801
Yeah.

42:23.802 --> 42:26.801
Yeah. Yeah, I go that way whenever
I'm sensing a lie,

42:26.802 --> 42:28.322
and this one is so fucking big,

42:28.347 --> 42:30.641
I'm surprised I'm not bouncing
off the fucking panelling!

42:30.642 --> 42:33.840
I think you should leave now.

42:45.642 --> 42:46.802
You.

42:49.602 --> 42:51.281
And by the way...

42:51.282 --> 42:52.961
thank you for the swimming lesson.

42:52.962 --> 42:54.721
My breaststroke is coming on a treat.

42:54.722 --> 42:57.041
- You're welcome.
- No, no, no.

42:57.042 --> 43:00.201
Forgot to sign in. Forgive me.

43:18.202 --> 43:19.242
Thank you.

44:01.242 --> 44:02.481
It's me.

44:02.482 --> 44:06.480
I've got it. Sophie Barre,
his daughter, gave it to us.

44:08.482 --> 44:12.002
And now... I'm going to flush out
that fucking priest.

44:40.762 --> 44:42.761
What are you doing?

44:42.762 --> 44:44.882
What does it look like?

45:41.242 --> 45:42.522
OK.

45:54.002 --> 45:56.241
- They won't speak to you.
- It's OK.

45:56.242 --> 45:57.722
I just needed them to listen.

47:10.702 --> 47:13.860
Frank! I told you not to come.

47:13.885 --> 47:16.121
Why not? I'm not on the indictment.

47:16.122 --> 47:19.121
You get a parking ticket and
they will blame me.

47:19.122 --> 47:20.782
You don't trust me to behave.

47:20.807 --> 47:23.241
I just don't want you to be compromised.

47:23.242 --> 47:25.641
I couldn't let you go through all
this on your own.

47:25.642 --> 47:27.921
I am not on my own.

47:27.922 --> 47:29.481
Not any more, you're not.

47:29.482 --> 47:31.921
Cos now Frankie's here.

47:35.482 --> 47:37.000
Hello, Frank.

47:41.365 --> 47:42.922
- Michael.
- Everything OK?

47:46.762 --> 47:49.721
Apart from having a wife on the
front page of every paper I

47:49.722 --> 47:51.001
pick up...

47:52.762 --> 47:56.801
if I wasn't such a big man,
it might have shrunk my Johnson.

47:58.802 --> 48:00.360
How are things back home?

48:01.602 --> 48:03.601
You've got to see it to believe it.

48:03.602 --> 48:07.361
In Kigali, there are 1,000 people
outside the embassy,

48:07.362 --> 48:09.881
at least, night and day.

48:09.882 --> 48:13.561
All chanting for your release,
all carrying your picture.

48:13.562 --> 48:16.526
You're a superstar, baby.
They love you, Alice.

48:16.551 --> 48:18.378
Could have been anyone.

48:18.379 --> 48:20.520
But it was you.

48:21.042 --> 48:24.761
- You chose to make the stand.
- I may still lose.

48:24.762 --> 48:28.521
You've got the love of your
country. You never lose that.

48:28.522 --> 48:31.282
I mean, I had someone come in and
see me last week.

48:32.322 --> 48:36.081
Offered me the keys to a
brand-new Land Rover,

48:36.082 --> 48:37.641
just to get a shot of you driving it.

48:39.122 --> 48:41.402
You did not accept it.

48:44.002 --> 48:45.761
No.

48:45.762 --> 48:47.993
No! Of course not!

48:47.994 --> 48:49.442
Of course I didn't!

48:51.642 --> 48:55.120
But... You've become one
powerful lady, baby.

48:56.962 --> 48:58.802
One powerful lady.

49:13.122 --> 49:15.960
- How's Hana, Mikey?
- The same.

49:17.182 --> 49:22.400
She'll stay that way now. At least
that's what the doctors say.

49:23.322 --> 49:25.442
She's still in there, so...

49:26.722 --> 49:27.960
it's not over yet.

49:29.482 --> 49:31.400
Everybody at the bank misses her.

49:32.642 --> 49:34.440
- Sends their best.
- Thank you.

49:36.762 --> 49:39.400
I still... You know...

49:40.522 --> 49:42.961
You did everything you could.

49:42.962 --> 49:45.201
- It wasn't enough.
- You got her back home.

49:45.202 --> 49:47.282
There's nothing else you could have done.

49:50.061 --> 49:52.261
Now, let's try and do the
same for your wife.

50:59.002 --> 51:02.802
Garry Shandling... How fun...

51:08.922 --> 51:10.161
Here we go.

51:17.802 --> 51:18.842
Got him.

51:36.322 --> 51:37.362
Bonjour, maman.

52:04.522 --> 52:05.681
Come on, Michael.

52:24.122 --> 52:25.802
What to do, what to do, what to do.

52:26.922 --> 52:30.322
Well, nothing. You got the shot you
need. Just pick him up tomorrow.

52:35.095 --> 52:36.735
He's leaving.

52:40.162 --> 52:41.801
Hello.

52:41.802 --> 52:43.402
What?

52:45.882 --> 52:47.722
Is that Picot? Shit!

53:34.682 --> 53:36.362
Hey!

53:44.642 --> 53:46.442
Fancy that.

53:52.882 --> 53:54.681
- You can't take that train.
- Yeah?

53:54.682 --> 53:56.796
If there is a macaque
who's going to stop me?

53:56.821 --> 53:58.160
No, this one is.

54:05.722 --> 54:07.601
I watch her, I watch him.

54:07.602 --> 54:09.881
And if I see anything happen to
either of them,

54:09.882 --> 54:12.200
you will not see the end of that day.

54:15.122 --> 54:17.481
- You should go to the hospital now.
- Why?

54:17.482 --> 54:21.720
Because, when you are a genocide
denier, you do not see straight.

54:27.562 --> 54:28.761
You should catch that train.

54:28.762 --> 54:30.740
Now!

54:34.162 --> 54:36.721
Picot!

54:53.642 --> 54:56.921
On the left of this photo is
Alexandra Lesage,

54:56.922 --> 55:00.201
taken 25 years ago when he
wasn't a general.

55:00.202 --> 55:03.681
The man in the centre is
Clement Barre, the son of the man

55:03.682 --> 55:07.562
who initiated this whole
prosecution, Jacques Antoine Barre.

55:09.522 --> 55:10.569
So?

55:10.594 --> 55:13.200
When asked, Monsieur Lesage
said he'd never met Clement.

55:13.762 --> 55:15.042
Clearly that's not true.

55:18.802 --> 55:23.480
You're trying to establish the
witness as unreliable?

55:24.362 --> 55:26.082
I think I can go further than that.

55:28.122 --> 55:29.161
Are you OK?

55:30.352 --> 55:31.744
Never better. So...

55:33.282 --> 55:36.321
I had the military record
of Clement Barre checked.

55:36.322 --> 55:40.281
He was the lieutenant in a French
Marine Parachute Regiment.

55:40.282 --> 55:44.401
Records show he was killed during a
training exercise in the.

55:44.402 --> 55:48.880
Central African Republic,
in March of 1993.

55:50.042 --> 55:54.441
But the thing is, that can't be
true. You see, a month before,

55:54.442 --> 55:57.121
Monsieur Lesage was made up to a captain.

55:57.122 --> 55:59.721
That's the rank he's
wearing in the photo.

55:59.722 --> 56:03.481
But he was only made it specifically
to lead a small group of

56:03.482 --> 56:08.080
paratroopers on a special
operation into Rwanda.

56:09.282 --> 56:11.122
In February 1993.

56:12.482 --> 56:14.400
Over a year before the genocide.

56:17.402 --> 56:19.221
Their mission was to train troops

56:19.246 --> 56:22.161
for the Rwandan government, the Hutus,

56:22.162 --> 56:24.961
to resist the advancing Tutsi army.

56:24.962 --> 56:27.713
The army in which Alice Munezero
was serving.

56:27.714 --> 56:32.761
But Lesage and Clement and the
unit were under strict

56:32.762 --> 56:37.281
instructions not to fire any of the
weapons themselves.

56:37.282 --> 56:39.041
Except...

56:39.042 --> 56:42.360
For some reason,
Clement Barre was killed.

56:43.922 --> 56:45.881
But officially...

56:45.882 --> 56:48.961
that never could have happened,
because if it had it would have

56:48.962 --> 56:52.081
exposed the fact that the French
military in effect of the

56:52.082 --> 56:55.641
French president was standing
shoulder to shoulder with

56:55.642 --> 56:58.761
what would turn out to be a
genocidal regime.

56:58.762 --> 57:02.841
So, Clement Barre's death was covered up,

57:02.842 --> 57:06.641
and Brigadier General Lesage had
to have been a part of that.

57:06.642 --> 57:08.480
That's what the photo shows.

57:22.482 --> 57:23.841
But...

57:23.842 --> 57:26.881
Even if all of this could be
corroborated, none of it

57:26.882 --> 57:30.881
undermines the central accusation
levelled against your client.

57:30.882 --> 57:34.201
Namely she murdered a French
national the following year.

57:34.202 --> 57:36.122
Except she didn't.
