WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:03.424
Previously on The Good Wife...
Son of a bitch!

00:03.470 --> 00:04.459
We're being evicted.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.626
How is that even possible?

00:05.670 --> 00:07.160
KALIN DA:
"If the leaseholder is unable

00:07.200 --> 00:09.031
"to be physically
on the premises,

00:09.070 --> 00:10.298
"said obligation
may be fulfilled

00:10.340 --> 00:12.479
by his or her proxy."

00:12.510 --> 00:15.331
Say hello to his or her proxy.

00:15.380 --> 00:18.201
BISHOP:
We can't coordinate, but you can
get to me through my associate.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.115
About what?
Your PAC.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.345
The PAC that I set up
in support of you.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.485
MARISSA:
Cough suppressant, nasal spray,

00:28.520 --> 00:31.057
decongestant, vitamin C.

00:31.090 --> 00:33.399
If you don't like cherry flavor,
there's orange.

00:33.430 --> 00:35.318
Let's see.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.499
Here. Oh, no, wait,
that's tropical.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.088
I'll go back and get orange.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.392
I don't have a cold.
You know that.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.237
Yeah, but it's prophylactic.
JOHNNY:
Okay, how we doing?

00:43.270 --> 00:45.602
Let's hear the voice.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.336
(raspy): _
I'm AIICIa Florrlck,

00:48.380 --> 00:50.268
and I'd like your endorsement.
It's not that bad.

00:50.310 --> 00:52.244
It's kind of cute, actually.
I called them.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.510
They still want to do
the interview today.
Good. I'm fine.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.108
Okay, I'll be back to pick
you up in three hours

00:56.150 --> 00:57.617
and take you over there.
Rest your voice.

00:57.650 --> 01:00.210
Is, um,
Prady's interview online?

01:00.260 --> 01:02.558
Yes, and don't worry about it.

01:02.590 --> 01:04.148
Which means I should worry
about it.
No.
Stop talking.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.555
Just listen.
Do you want me
to make you some tea?

01:05.590 --> 01:06.557
I'll make you some tea.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.726
No, no, I'm fine.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.159
Guys.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.521
I just have been giving
too many speeches.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.094
Look, we're entering
the home stretch.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.539
We're a week away
from election day,

01:14.570 --> 01:15.832
and you and Prady
are neck and neck.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.701
So this interview today,
it's everything.

01:17.740 --> 01:19.469
You have a great bedside manner.
"Don't worry about it,

01:19.510 --> 01:21.671
but if you screw this up,
everyone will die."

01:21.710 --> 01:23.439
JOHNNY: If you get the
editorial board's endorsement,

01:23.480 --> 01:25.277
traditionally speaking,
that's two points in the polls.

01:25.310 --> 01:27.278
Now, you need it
and he needs it.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.571
So whoever gets it wins,

01:28.620 --> 01:29.746
you understand? Don't talk.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.644
MARISSA:
She understands.

01:31.690 --> 01:32.850
JOHNNY: Here's the thing.
It's a conservative paper.

01:32.890 --> 01:35.279
It's an old democratic machine.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.878
That works in your favor.
They like Peter.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.319
So sell them on the whole
stand-by-your-man stuff

01:39.360 --> 01:40.622
and be tough on crime.

01:40.660 --> 01:41.820
Are they gonna ask
about Zach?

01:41.860 --> 01:43.191
About the abortion?

01:43.230 --> 01:44.527
They might. If they do,

01:44.570 --> 01:45.867
just give them
the angry mom thing.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.128
My angry mom thing?
Don't talk.

01:47.170 --> 01:47.864
Just nod.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.265
Okay?

01:49.310 --> 01:50.709
We're leaving now.

01:50.740 --> 01:52.230
Rest your voice,
don't take any calls.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.202
Matter of fact,
let me take that.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.276
I'm fine.
No, you're not.
I'm turning it off.

01:56.310 --> 01:58.175
Rest your voice. Stay here
for the next three hours.

01:58.210 --> 02:00.314
Don't think about anything else.
I will be back to pick you up.

02:00.350 --> 02:02.284
Marissa, it's time to leave.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.288
Call me if you need anything.
You'll be great.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.151
And don't take
the nighttime stuff

02:06.190 --> 02:07.418
before the interview
or you'll be loopy.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.224
I don't have a cold.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.251
We're going now.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.591
(door closes)

02:38.490 --> 02:40.219
INTERVIEWER: Thank you
for doing this, Mr. Prady.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.750
Thank you for having me.

02:41.790 --> 02:44.759
I-I, it's a, it's good
to finally get down

02:44.790 --> 02:46.894
to the substance
of this campaign.

02:46.930 --> 02:50.866
Actually, who had a lot to do
with my thinking about the,

02:50.900 --> 02:52.891
uh, the SA. office
was Alicia Florrick.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.738
INTERVIEWER: _
That you'll have to explain.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.499
My campaign manager
is not gonna be happy.

02:57.540 --> 02:58.939
Uh, I'm supposed
to say "opponent,"

02:58.970 --> 03:00.676
not her name, but, uh,

03:00.710 --> 03:02.803
somehow I think you won't
be tricked by that.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.272
We might be.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.504
Oh.
(laughter)

03:05.550 --> 03:07.472
Well, Alicia thinks the problems

03:07.520 --> 03:09.488
with the state's attorney's
office are small.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.715
Better management,
more expertise.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.787
I believe they are large issues.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.424
A racist infrastructure,

03:16.460 --> 03:17.586
a militari...

03:17.630 --> 03:20.554
(video clicks off)

03:20.600 --> 03:22.363
INTERVIEWER:
Frank Prady said

03:22.400 --> 03:24.322
you believe the issues
in the S.A.'s office

03:24.370 --> 03:26.838
are small and manageable.
Is that true?

03:26.870 --> 03:28.735
Well, even manageable issues
aren't small.

03:28.770 --> 03:30.931
They do need to be managed.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.972
And the good thing
about manageable issues

03:33.010 --> 03:34.978
is that I can be
held accountable.

03:35.010 --> 03:37.877
IfI don't bring in more
hate crime prosecutions

03:37.910 --> 03:39.446
in my first hundred days,

03:39.480 --> 03:40.970
fire me.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.385
What does that even mean,
"fire you"?

03:44.420 --> 03:46.513
How can they fire you?
You're already in office.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.881
It's not about practicality,
it's about sounding good.

03:54.330 --> 03:56.890
I know it makes good copy
if I criticize my opponent,

03:56.930 --> 03:58.466
but I won't do it.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.468
Okay. How about her husband?

04:00.500 --> 04:02.036
(laughter)

04:02.070 --> 04:03.708
How much time do we have?

04:03.740 --> 04:05.435
No, no, no.

04:05.470 --> 04:07.836
INTERVIEWER:
You're not as funny

04:07.880 --> 04:10.678
or as likable as Mr. Prady,
are you, Mrs. Florrick?

04:10.710 --> 04:13.372
Well, I think I'm likable.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.547
But more importantly,
I'm passionate.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.047
ELI:
That makes it sound like

04:17.090 --> 04:18.842
you're acknowledging
you're not likable.

04:18.890 --> 04:22.724
No, she's trying to turn
a negative into a positive.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.523
Are you acknowledging
you're not funny or likable?

04:24.560 --> 04:28.394
No, I'm just saying
that likability

04:28.430 --> 04:30.796
is not a key component
to the job.

04:30.830 --> 04:33.731
Frank Prady has been a reporter
for the last five...

04:33.770 --> 04:35.635
We said we wouldn't smear
each other.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.477
Likability is not
a key component to the job.

04:40.510 --> 04:44.298
I've spent the last five years
working full-time as a lawyer.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.478
I haven't had time to finesse
my onscreen presence.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.817
Good, elegant.
Don't forget,

04:48.850 --> 04:50.511
it's a conservative
newspaper.

04:53.990 --> 04:55.582
So, let's turn
to your home life.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.019
How about your son, Zach?

04:58.360 --> 04:59.554
Did he get an abortion

04:59.600 --> 05:01.750
with his 15-year-old
girlfriend?

05:01.800 --> 05:04.360
ELI: _
Why do you still
freeze up at that?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.368
It's a question you'll be asked.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.799
She's not still_
freezrng up at It.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.637
This is the first time
she's been asked it.

05:09.670 --> 05:11.501
It's not even the first time
she's been asked it,

05:11.540 --> 05:13.303
because we're just in her
imagination thinking about...

05:27.460 --> 05:28.916
I'm fine, Mom.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.587
You don't have to worry
about me.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.575
(phone rings)

05:53.580 --> 05:55.138
Hello, Mr. Canning.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.989
Alicia?

05:57.020 --> 05:58.840
You okay? You sound sick.

05:58.890 --> 06:00.755
No, I'm just resting my voice.

06:00.790 --> 06:01.984
Okay, good.

06:02.020 --> 06:03.453
Well, I'll do all the talking.

06:03.490 --> 06:05.151
I-I want to settle

06:05.190 --> 06:06.555
this lawsuit between us.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.953
I-I'm not well,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.422
and-and I don't want
to leave this earth

06:09.470 --> 06:10.869
with this hanging
over our heads.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.130
Mr. Canning,
you've been leaving this earth

06:13.170 --> 06:14.660
for three months now.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.736
So excuse my incredulity.

06:16.770 --> 06:19.034
I'm suing your firm
for wrongful eviction.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.628
It's a $12 million suit,

06:20.680 --> 06:22.170
but for old times' sake, Alicia,

06:22.210 --> 06:24.098
I'm willing to settle
for $4 million.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.072
Really? So that'll only cost me

06:26.110 --> 06:28.112
$500,000 out of pocket?

06:28.150 --> 06:30.710
(chuckles) Well, it's better
than $2 million out of pocket.

06:30.750 --> 06:31.887
It's a nuisance suit,

06:31.920 --> 06:33.911
Mr. Canning.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.916
You were evicted; get over it.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.655
I was wrongfully evicted,
and I just don't think

06:37.690 --> 06:38.884
you want to be in depositions

06:38.930 --> 06:40.192
during your last week
of the campaign.

06:40.230 --> 06:41.549
You won't look good
being deposed

06:41.600 --> 06:42.692
by a deathly i|| man.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.527
You're amazing, Mr. Canning.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.629
You're supposedly in
the last few weeks of your life,

06:46.670 --> 06:48.729
and you would rather
be battling me

06:48.770 --> 06:49.907
than home with your family.

06:49.940 --> 06:51.908
I can do both.

06:51.940 --> 06:54.477
Call me by 6:00 pm. today
with your counteroffer,

06:54.510 --> 06:56.205
or I'll see you
in depositions tomorrow.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.049
Depositions that won't look good
in the press.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.048
You don't have a case,
Mr. Canning.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.479
Come on, Alicia.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.919
You're a chess player.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.986
Think it through.

07:05.020 --> 07:08.057
This one I'll win.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.635
This office was mine to sublet
to whomever I wanted.

07:23.670 --> 07:26.798
I chose to evict Mr. Canning
and his firm

07:26.840 --> 07:28.728
so that
I could occupy it myself.

07:28.780 --> 07:31.908
CANNING: Diane was no longer
a tenant in the building.

07:31.950 --> 07:34.510
It was illegal for her
to evict our firm.

07:34.550 --> 07:36.484
It's true I wasn't a tenant,

07:36.520 --> 07:37.919
but my proxy was.

07:37.950 --> 07:39.952
Howard Lyman had office space.

07:39.990 --> 07:42.879
Yes, but Howard Lyman was hired
for fraudulent reasons

07:42.930 --> 07:44.659
explicitly to-to evict me.

07:44.690 --> 07:46.658
And that's a wrongful eviction.

08:06.310 --> 08:07.675
Howard Lyman
was not Diane's prow

08:07.720 --> 08:09.039
because at the time
of the eviction,

08:09.080 --> 08:10.718
she had no signed agreement
with him.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.291
October 18.

08:24.330 --> 08:27.299
That was the day Howard signed
his partnership agreement.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.558
Two weeks after I was evicted.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.305
Howard could not
have been Diane's proxy

08:31.340 --> 08:33.808
because at the time,
he was still a partner of mine.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.285
Good morning, everyone.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.753
How are we doing?

08:47.790 --> 08:49.587
Ooh, bagels.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.251
I didn't need
a written contract.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.824
I had an oral agreement
with Diane.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.019
That's how I became her proxy.

08:59.070 --> 09:02.062
Queen takes your bishop,
Mr. Canning.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.637
Not really.

09:10.780 --> 09:13.715
What were the particulars

09:13.750 --> 09:15.809
of your oral agreement,
Mr. Lyman?

09:15.850 --> 09:17.886
Um... what?

09:17.920 --> 09:19.888
What were the particulars
of your oral agreement

09:19.920 --> 09:21.581
with Diane Lockhart?

09:21.620 --> 09:23.326
You know,
that I become a partner.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.827
You understand

09:24.860 --> 09:26.225
that an oral agreement
isn't valid

09:26.260 --> 09:28.820
unless both parties
understand the terms.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.066
So, did you understand
the terms?

09:30.100 --> 09:31.260
Sure.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.937
And what were they?

09:33.970 --> 09:37.064
Um...

09:37.110 --> 09:38.805
Rook

09:38.840 --> 09:40.102
to queen four.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.359
Hi, I'm David Lee, family law.

09:54.390 --> 09:57.279
You used to work
as Mr. Canning's partner,

09:57.330 --> 09:59.082
didn't you, Mr. Lee?

09:59.130 --> 10:01.121
Yes. Hello, Mr. Canning.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.764
Hi.
And now,

10:02.800 --> 10:04.961
you work
for Florrick, Agos & Lockhart.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.161
Yes.
And once Mr. Lyman
came to you and Canning

10:07.200 --> 10:09.634
and told you he was leaving,

10:09.670 --> 10:12.138
did you try to outbid
for his services?

10:12.170 --> 10:13.774
We did.
In other words,

10:13.810 --> 10:16.779
you understood his
oral agreement to be genuine.

10:16.810 --> 10:18.641
We did.
That's all we need.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.978
Howard doesn't need
to understand the particulars

10:21.020 --> 10:22.373
of his contract.

10:22.420 --> 10:23.819
You did.

10:33.930 --> 10:36.194
Mr. Canning, hello.

10:36.230 --> 10:38.664
I have an answer for you now

10:38.700 --> 10:40.065
on your suit, if you want.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.295
Well, now you're
sounding confident, Alicia.

10:42.340 --> 10:44.331
You were right to tell me
to game it through,

10:44.370 --> 10:46.702
because...

10:49.240 --> 10:50.343
Yes?

10:50.380 --> 10:51.904
I'm gonna call you back,

10:51.950 --> 10:53.178
uh, Mr. Canning.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.915
I have to deal
with something here.

10:54.950 --> 10:56.440
Oh, absolutely.
Take your time, Alicia.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.347
I-I want you to be
perfectly comfortable

10:59.390 --> 11:00.857
with your decision.

11:19.010 --> 11:21.001
(line ringing)

11:22.440 --> 11:23.976
Hello?

11:24.010 --> 11:25.978
Yeah. I think we have a problem

11:26.010 --> 11:28.012
with our wrongful eviction suit.

11:28.050 --> 11:30.439
Yeah, what's that?
Are all the partners on the hook

11:30.490 --> 11:32.310
if we pay Canning?
Yeah.

11:32.350 --> 11:33.419
Even David Lee?

11:35.290 --> 11:37.019
No.

11:37.060 --> 11:39.324
He joined
the partnership aftenNards.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.395
You think there's
a problem there?

11:40.430 --> 11:41.727
Yes.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.193
Can you find out if David Lee

11:43.230 --> 11:45.118
has been in touch with Canning?
Sure.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.035
Are you okay?
You sound like you have a cold.

11:47.070 --> 11:48.196
It's just laryngitis.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.867
Oh, that's my call waiting.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.935
Can you get back to me
in the next hour or so?

11:51.970 --> 11:53.972
Sure.

11:57.180 --> 11:58.738
(quiet laugh)

11:58.780 --> 12:00.145
Hello.

12:00.180 --> 12:01.772
It's me.
W-Why is your phone on?

12:01.820 --> 12:03.219
Why are you calling me?

12:03.250 --> 12:05.241
Uh... we have a problem.

12:05.290 --> 12:07.315
Uh, there's this blog
called Court Scene.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.782
And they're reporting something

12:08.820 --> 12:10.151
that may end up
in your interview.

12:10.190 --> 12:11.350
And you need to answer it.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.823
About Zach?
No. About Bishop.

12:12.860 --> 12:14.293
Apparently there's a wiretap

12:14.330 --> 12:15.854
where he's supposedly saying,

12:15.900 --> 12:17.299
"Don't worry
about getting arrested.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.218
I just bought
the next state's attorney."

12:19.270 --> 12:20.294
(sighs)

12:20.340 --> 12:22.228
Did you hear what I said?

12:22.270 --> 12:23.498
I did.

12:23.540 --> 12:25.360
Alicia, this is... devastating.

12:25.410 --> 12:28.106
You said "supposedly saying"
there was a wiretap.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.199
Was there or not?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.047
Well, it doesn't matter if it's
real; the rumor is the reality.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.240
You need to respond.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.918
How can I answer if I don't know

12:34.950 --> 12:36.110
if it's true or not?

12:36.150 --> 12:37.549
I'll work up a response.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.512
You just turn your phone off
and focus, okay?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.087
Yeah, this is really helping.

12:46.230 --> 12:48.494
INTERVIEWER:
Mrs. Florrick?

12:48.530 --> 12:50.418
Are you in league
with Lemond Bishop,

12:50.470 --> 12:52.995
the top drug
dealer in town?

13:00.410 --> 13:02.105
Damn.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.029
Don't worry about an arrest.

13:27.070 --> 13:29.288
I just bought
the next state's attorney.

13:32.470 --> 13:34.028
Don't worry about an arrest.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.947
I just bought
the next state's attorney.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.572
Although I guess
she won't be in office

13:38.610 --> 13:40.339
for six months.

13:42.350 --> 13:44.045
Don't worry about an arrest.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.285
I just bought
the next state's attorney.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.483
Although I guess she won't be
in office for six months.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.959
You know what?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.991
She might lose to her opponent.

13:58.130 --> 14:01.395
You want me to respond
to a rumor of a wiretap?

14:01.440 --> 14:03.101
Yes.
It doesn't even make sense.

14:03.140 --> 14:04.368
I'm neck and neck with Prady.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.900
Even if I do win,

14:05.940 --> 14:08.829
I won't take office
for another six months.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.499
You're acknowledging
the premise of the question!

14:12.550 --> 14:14.472
Only because it's
a stupid question.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.476
No, it's not.
It's a likely question.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.044
(cell phone ringing)

14:26.360 --> 14:28.248
Hello.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.961
KALINDA:
You're right. There are 22 calls

14:30.000 --> 14:32.195
between David Lee and Canning
over the last week.

14:32.230 --> 14:33.436
That's why Canning is
so confident.

14:33.470 --> 14:34.937
He's got David Lee on his side.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.130
Yeah, look.

14:36.170 --> 14:38.400
I have Diane and
Cary here, hold on.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.135
So, you think David Lee's
gonna testify against us?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.636
I think Canning's
counting on it.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.568
_That's how he'll_win
hIS wrongful conVIctIon.

14:43.610 --> 14:45.544
Do you have a cold, Alicia?
No, just laryngitis.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.548
Even if he wins on
wrongful eVIctIon,

14:47.580 --> 14:49.639
all he should get is what he's
out on rent for the week.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.443
Right, that can't be
more than $30,000.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.458
We undercut him on damages.

14:53.490 --> 14:55.651
Canning called me
with an offer of $4 million.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.658
Why did he call you?
I don't know. Maybe he thought

14:57.690 --> 14:59.123
I would want to settle.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.391
Because of your campaign?

15:02.430 --> 15:03.624
Yes.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.092
Are you wanting to settle?

15:05.130 --> 15:07.530
No. Not at $4 million.

15:07.570 --> 15:10.334
Good, so we use the depositions
to undercut the damages.

15:10.370 --> 15:12.201
Are you coming in later?

15:12.240 --> 15:14.231
No. I-I have an interview.
I'll be in tomorrow.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.305
Okay, rest your voice, Alicia.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.439
What do you want me to do?

15:43.470 --> 15:46.030
Divest yourself of the PAC.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.435
Why?

15:47.480 --> 15:50.176
Because it's hurting me.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.178
No. What's hurting you

15:52.210 --> 15:54.178
is you being here
in my kitchen.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.057
What do you want me to do?

16:00.090 --> 16:02.718
Divest yourself
of Alicia's PAC.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.182
Why?

16:04.230 --> 16:05.527
Because it's hurting her.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.096
It's going to hurt
her twice as much

16:07.130 --> 16:08.495
ifI pull my money now.

16:08.530 --> 16:11.192
It'll look like a reaction
to these rumors.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.232
You want Alicia to win, right?
You want...

16:24.410 --> 16:26.173
Kalinda.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.479
I've been thinking about you.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.626
And I've been
thinking about you.

16:38.660 --> 16:41.527
We don't talk this way,
and you know it.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.178
$4 million is not punitive.

16:53.210 --> 16:54.507
It's actual.

16:54.540 --> 16:55.802
You're telling us
you have $12 million

16:55.840 --> 16:57.307
in actual damages
from your eviction?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.374
Yes.

16:58.410 --> 16:59.775
I lost my top client.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.176
That's $12 million
in annual earnings.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.085
You didn't lose your client
because we evicted you.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.587
We were in the middle
of a crucral

17:05.620 --> 17:08.282
settlement conference
and we had nowhere to meet.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.719
Oh, come on.
Come on what?

17:09.760 --> 17:11.227
If you want me to do something,

17:11.260 --> 17:13.251
I could put in a statement

17:13.300 --> 17:15.256
supporting Frank Prady.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.291
Excuse me?

17:20.500 --> 17:23.606
I could put out a statement
in support of Frank Prady.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.130
What would that do?
I didn't say on the wiretap

17:25.170 --> 17:27.479
which state's attorney
I had bought.

17:27.510 --> 17:30.638
You want to imply
it's Frank Prady?

17:30.680 --> 17:32.739
No. Ijust want
to muddy the waters.

17:32.780 --> 17:36.614
I had a top client who fired us
the week of our eviction.

17:36.650 --> 17:40.211
A top client who'd been
with me for years.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.182
Which client is that?

17:45.290 --> 17:47.599
Solis Securities.
We can't be held

17:47.630 --> 17:49.120
responsible for the whims
of a client.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.388
This is an affidavit

17:50.430 --> 17:51.829
from the CEO of Solis

17:51.870 --> 17:53.360
claiming it was our delay

17:53.400 --> 17:54.731
in handling
the settlement conference

17:54.770 --> 17:56.397
that led to our ouster.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.448
Mr. Canning, you said you lost

18:05.480 --> 18:07.448
your top client Solis Securities

18:07.480 --> 18:08.845
due to your eviction?

18:08.880 --> 18:09.847
That's correct.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.586
Solis Securities left you

18:11.620 --> 18:12.587
and joined which firm?

18:12.620 --> 18:14.349
Brooks, Spelling & Myers.

18:14.390 --> 18:16.608
A firm of equal size,
equal equity

18:16.660 --> 18:19.424
_ and also_one
wrthout an office space.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.724
What?
Yes.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.318
They were going through
a move of their own

18:23.370 --> 18:24.894
at the same time as yours.

18:24.930 --> 18:28.331
So, why would
Solis Securities leave you

18:28.370 --> 18:31.601
and join another firm
that was homeless?

18:31.640 --> 18:33.733
I don't know.
Why would they leave?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.873
Why would a firm that's been
with me for a decade

18:35.910 --> 18:38.344
just suddenly turn around
andleave?

18:38.380 --> 18:41.213
HOWARD:
I like to take
a nap at lunchtime.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.877
But my pants,
they get, you know,

18:42.920 --> 18:45.639
so sweaty, so, uh,
I remove them.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.214
Uh, just at lunchtime.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.716
You're kidding.
And the CEO of Solis

18:48.760 --> 18:50.887
happened upon you over lunch.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.626
Yeah, but... I explained.

18:53.660 --> 18:55.628
Think he understood.

18:55.660 --> 18:56.922
And one week later,

18:56.960 --> 18:58.769
Solis Securities decided

18:58.800 --> 19:01.360
to leave the firm.

19:11.810 --> 19:13.778
INTERVIEWER:
So, again

19:13.820 --> 19:15.310
you have nothing to do
with Lemond Bishop?

19:15.350 --> 19:16.510
That's correct.

19:16.550 --> 19:17.812
Ever since we fired him
as a client.

19:17.850 --> 19:19.738
Okay, moving on.

19:19.790 --> 19:20.950
CANNING:
Well, you can't just
leave it like that.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.412
She's a crafty one.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.449
You have to ask her

19:23.490 --> 19:24.479
a question with no out.

19:24.530 --> 19:25.679
And what might that be?

19:25.730 --> 19:26.719
To your knowledge,
Mrs. Florrick,

19:26.760 --> 19:27.749
has Lemond Bishop,

19:27.800 --> 19:29.427
the top drug dealer in Chicago,

19:29.460 --> 19:31.291
ever contributed any
money to your campaign

19:31.330 --> 19:32.558
or PAC supporting
your campaign?

19:32.600 --> 19:33.760
First of all,
I have no coordination...

19:33.800 --> 19:34.869
That's not the question.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.201
To your knowledge,

19:39.240 --> 19:42.676
has Lemond Bishop contributed
to your campaign or PAC?

19:51.990 --> 19:53.548
You can't te||_them
you're knowmgly

19:53.590 --> 19:54.989
taking money
from the top drug dealer

19:55.020 --> 19:56.419
in town.

19:56.460 --> 19:57.654
But I am knowingly taking money

19:57.690 --> 19:59.248
from the top drug
dealer in town.

19:59.290 --> 20:00.291
No, you're not.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.695
I am. He told me.

20:01.730 --> 20:03.493
Maybe they won't
ask the question.

20:03.530 --> 20:05.225
Where is this rumor
even coming from anyway?

20:05.270 --> 20:06.919
Some stupid little Web site.

20:06.970 --> 20:08.528
What was it called?

20:20.450 --> 20:22.816
(music playing on computer)

20:22.850 --> 20:25.648
WILL'S VOICE:
What do you want
in a credit card?

20:27.390 --> 20:30.325
No rotating categories?

20:30.360 --> 20:32.487
No signups to earn cash rewards?

20:32.530 --> 20:35.419
Earning unlimited 1.5% cash back
on every purchase

20:35.460 --> 20:36.791
every day?

20:36.830 --> 20:39.390
Zero percent intro APR
on purchases

20:39.430 --> 20:41.330
until September of 2015?

20:41.370 --> 20:42.837
You've got it.

20:42.870 --> 20:45.907
What do you want
in a credit card?

20:45.940 --> 20:47.498
Everything.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.355
What do you want
in a credit card?

21:00.390 --> 21:02.449
(music stops playing)

21:09.000 --> 21:10.399
Will?

21:16.640 --> 21:19.302
I'm not here.

21:19.340 --> 21:22.673
It sounds like you.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.924
Marissa, have you been
out here the whole time?

21:39.960 --> 21:41.791
It hasn't been the whole time.
Just half an hour.

21:41.830 --> 21:43.366
In case you needed anything.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.493
Where you going?
Out. I need some fresh air.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.395
I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.067
I need to focus.
I can't focus in there.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.409
I'll come with you.
No, no. I-I'll be okay.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.668
I just need ten minutes
of fresh air.

21:52.710 --> 21:53.938
It's cold out there.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.379
I'll be okay.

21:55.410 --> 21:56.502
Are you really okay?

21:56.540 --> 21:58.041
Yeah.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.672
I don't know. I think.

21:59.710 --> 22:01.314
I'll-I'll see you.

You're out walking, Alicia.

22:57.440 --> 22:58.759
Marissa said_
you're out walking.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.630
I just need to clear my head.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.477
You're getting worked up
about the interview.

23:02.510 --> 23:03.909
It's gonna be fine.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.838
No, it isn't.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.916
I did know Bishop
put money in my PAC.

23:07.950 --> 23:08.974
Look,

23:09.020 --> 23:11.113
here's the thing--

23:11.150 --> 23:13.038
this might not even come up
in the interview.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.188
They're gonna ask me

23:16.220 --> 23:19.587
a question
I can't answer "no" to.

23:19.630 --> 23:20.892
And what is that?

23:20.930 --> 23:22.795
To my knowledge,

23:22.830 --> 23:24.695
did Bishop give money
to me or my PAC?

23:24.730 --> 23:26.197
(car horn honks)

MAN:
Watch where you're going!
Oh, my God.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.800
What?
And why can't you answer no?

23:30.840 --> 23:33.809
Jon... it's true.

23:33.840 --> 23:38.004
Bishop told me directly
he was giving money to my PAC.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.938
He was forming my PAC.

23:39.980 --> 23:41.675
But you don't know
that he did it.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.017
Jon...!

23:43.050 --> 23:45.587
You're a lavwer.
Answer to what you know, right?

23:45.620 --> 23:47.679
You don't actually know that
Bishop gave money to your PAC.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.210
You just know
that he said he would.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.921
In fact, you can't know

23:50.960 --> 23:52.484
that Bishop gave money
to your PAC,

23:52.530 --> 23:53.997
because that would be
coordinating with your PAC,

23:54.030 --> 23:55.895
and coordinating with
your PAC is against the law.

23:55.930 --> 23:57.864
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.765
Excuse me?
What?

23:59.800 --> 24:01.097
You said, "Oh, my God."

24:04.870 --> 24:05.837
(clears throat)

24:05.870 --> 24:07.007
I just had a thought.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.678
Alicia,
remember what I told you?

24:08.710 --> 24:09.677
No.

24:09.710 --> 24:11.678
Questions are for dopes.

24:11.710 --> 24:12.938
Oh. Right.

24:12.980 --> 24:14.948
This is one of those questions.

24:14.980 --> 24:18.211
It's not being sophist to answer
it with some...

24:18.250 --> 24:20.218
specificity.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.117
Okay.
Let me think on it.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.855
Good. Go home, clear your head,

24:24.890 --> 24:26.255
don't think about anything else.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.848
See you in two hours.

CANNING:
Solis Securities fired me

27:59.410 --> 28:01.139
because my health is in decline

28:01.180 --> 28:03.000
and, therefore,
my work was not at its best.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.077
And my inadequate performance
came about

28:06.110 --> 28:08.749
because I spent two furious
weeks looking for office space.

28:08.780 --> 28:11.248
My health was
negatively impacted

28:11.290 --> 28:13.713
by the fact that you all
threw me out in the street--

liver disease.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.259

seems to come and go

28:17.290 --> 28:18.985
whenever you need it to.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.759
Is that a question?

28:20.800 --> 28:23.052
Yes, actually, it is.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.465
I'm appalled at you,
Mrs. Florrick--

28:24.500 --> 28:26.297
questioning my health.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.991
Especially with you
running for office.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.496
You're being deposed.
You're under oath.

28:29.540 --> 28:31.269
So...

28:31.310 --> 28:32.902
let's take this seriously.

28:32.940 --> 28:34.908
Is your liver failing?

28:34.940 --> 28:36.874
It's my kidney,
and, yes, it's failing.

28:36.910 --> 28:38.468
The last time I saw you,
you had a kidney transplant.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.774
What happened?
It failed.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.173
And how long did the doctors
say you had to live?

28:42.220 --> 28:44.211
Two months, if I'm luclq.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.888
More, if I can find
another kidney.

28:45.920 --> 28:51.187
So why are you here,
spending your time, suing us?

28:51.230 --> 28:52.458

you're fighting with me.

28:52.490 --> 28:54.492
I mean, it's what we do.
I don't believe you.

28:54.530 --> 28:57.294
Obviously, because you'd have
more compassion, if you did.

28:57.330 --> 28:59.423
You use compassion like
it's a currency, Mr. Canning.

28:59.470 --> 29:01.893

I'm not attacking you!

29:01.940 --> 29:03.134

and I'll have won.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.795
Yes.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.337
What did you think it was?

29:41.610 --> 29:42.929

I thought I did.

Hi.

29:56.220 --> 29:58.950
I've given it a lot of thought.

29:58.990 --> 30:00.582
I think we need to pay Canning.

30:00.630 --> 30:02.825
Not all of it, but some of it,

30:02.860 --> 30:05.590

his illness to hurt us.

Yeah, we thought the
same thing, but...

30:07.500 --> 30:10.094

happened here.

Canning canceled
the depositions for tomorrow.

Yeah. It just happened.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.848

30:22.880 --> 30:24.347
All we know
is that he fainted.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.210

we should hold off

30:26.250 --> 30:28.218
on any negotiations
or offer,

30:28.260 --> 30:30.251

was calling from Harbor,

Mrs. Florrick,

31:49.000 --> 31:52.299
has Lemond Bishop contributed
money to your campaign

31:52.340 --> 31:54.274
_ or PACs _
supporting your campaign?

31:54.310 --> 31:56.005
No.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.170
You're sure?

31:58.210 --> 32:00.007
Yes. Not to my knowledge.

32:15.030 --> 32:17.191
ALICIA:
Why are you done?

32:17.230 --> 32:18.959
Why shouldn't I be done?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.524
Well, I don't know.

32:20.570 --> 32:22.390
I... Ithought
it mattered to you.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.260
It did matter to me.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.130
Now it doesn't.

32:26.170 --> 32:28.536
That happens.
I thought you'd be happy.

32:36.720 --> 32:37.982
I know.

32:38.020 --> 32:39.146

32:40.450 --> 32:41.417
I don't know.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.280
Maybe there is no problem.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.151
The problem isn't language.

32:45.190 --> 32:47.556
People rejoice
when somebody finds Jesus,

32:47.590 --> 32:49.023
even though it's false.

32:49.060 --> 32:50.618
But we lack language
for rejoicing

32:50.660 --> 32:52.264
when someone finds the truth.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.090
Who are you again?

32:55.140 --> 32:56.266
Richard Dawkins.

33:13.220 --> 33:14.653
See, that's offensive.

33:14.690 --> 33:16.658
There's no reason Grace
suddenly becomes pregnant

33:16.690 --> 33:18.328
and starts sniffing glue.

33:18.360 --> 33:19.759
I'm not saying it's due
to loss of religion.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.326
DAWKINS:
Yes, you are.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.328
But_an atheist_ can act
just as ethically

33:23.360 --> 33:25.328
as a Christian,
maybe even more so.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.326
We deal in the truth.

33:27.370 --> 33:29.634
Look at all those priests
who raped small boys.

33:32.670 --> 33:35.207
but it certainly doesn't
seem to stop them.

33:35.240 --> 33:39.199
There is no ethical standard
without the absolute of God.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.774
Everything else slides
without it.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.472
That is just not true.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.738
We can choose to live
by the Golden Rule.

33:45.790 --> 33:48.759
It h_onors men and women more
if they choose to do right.

33:48.790 --> 33:51.486
And not worry about some
Santa Claus-like figure

33:51.530 --> 33:53.782
who punishes and rewards
based on us doing right.

33:53.830 --> 33:56.219
Yeah, but what about Zach?

33:56.260 --> 33:59.491
Do you really want Grace
to turn out like Zach?

33:59.530 --> 34:02.567
Why am I being used
as an example of what not to do?

34:02.600 --> 34:04.261
I'm at Georgetown.

34:05.570 --> 34:07.538
SIMONE:
Daddy's sleeping right now,

34:07.570 --> 34:08.537
but he's okay.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.070
We'll see him
tomorrow.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.179
Daddy loves you both.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.240
So what is this?
An intervention?

34:18.290 --> 34:20.781
No, I just wanted you to be able
to discuss it with someone.

34:20.820 --> 34:21.809
GRACE:
Why not you?

34:21.860 --> 34:23.213
Why not what me?

34:23.260 --> 34:24.727
Why can't I discuss it
with you?

34:24.760 --> 34:26.284
Because I don't believe
in what you do.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.321
I know, so why can't I
be more like you?

34:28.360 --> 34:30.191
Uh, you don't want
to be like your mom.

34:30.230 --> 34:31.595
Wait, why not?

34:31.630 --> 34:33.723
Because of your
interview.

34:33.770 --> 34:35.738
You're planning
to lie.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.203
Why isn't it lying?

34:38.240 --> 34:39.867
Because I can't_ answer
the question

34:39.910 --> 34:41.571
without coordinating
with my PAC.

34:41.610 --> 34:44.101
And the other thing...
that Jon said.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.448
Uh, you mean the Jon you're
planning to sleep with.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.778
No.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.776
Yes.

34:50.820 --> 34:52.344
But why is that bad?

34:52.390 --> 34:53.516
Because you're
married.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.518
Peter and I have
an agreement.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.858
You know, I am really sick
of you guys

34:57.890 --> 34:59.551
playing into this
"good girl" thing.

34:59.590 --> 35:01.296
Making me feel guilty.

35:01.330 --> 35:03.457
He slept with Kalinda.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.467
He slept with Ramona.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.694
He screwed hookers.

35:05.730 --> 35:07.322
Then tell the truth.
I am.

35:07.370 --> 35:09.292
No, at your interview.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.160
If I do that,
I won't get elected.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.859
How do you know that?

35:15.880 --> 35:17.575
To your knowledge,
Mrs. Florrick,

35:17.610 --> 35:20.204
has Lemond Bishop contributed
money to your campaign

35:20.250 --> 35:22.218
or PACs supporting
your campaign?

35:22.250 --> 35:23.877
Yes.

35:25.350 --> 35:27.318
Yes, he did?

35:27.350 --> 35:30.285
The top drug dealer in town did?

35:30.320 --> 35:33.289
Yes, I had no control
of what he did.

35:33.330 --> 35:36.322
Bishop told me
that he was financing my PAC.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.739
We're very impressed,
Mrs. Florrick.

35:41.770 --> 35:44.432
We're used to th_e_c_anned answers
of politICIans,

35:44.470 --> 35:46.904
the casual lies,

35:46.940 --> 35:50.171
but you've been very brave in
here today by telling the truth.

35:50.210 --> 35:53.179
So we're gonna give
you our endorsement.

35:53.210 --> 35:54.472
Really?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.613
GRACE: That was
very brave of you, Mom.

35:56.650 --> 35:58.641
One doesn't need God
to act ethically.

36:01.890 --> 36:03.858
ELI:
Well, enjoy your hug.

36:03.890 --> 36:06.279
'Cause that's not really how
it's gonna go, and you know it.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.252
MARISSA: Uh-oh.
What?

36:08.300 --> 36:11.224
_ Buzzfeed--_ "Is Alicia Florrick
in league With a drug dealer?"

36:11.270 --> 36:12.692
There's one
on Politico, too.

36:12.730 --> 36:15.198
"Does Florri_ck have a secret
agreement With Lemond Bishop

36:15.240 --> 36:16.491
to go lightly
on drug arrests?"

36:20.610 --> 36:23.374
SIMONE:
Alicia, hello.

36:23.410 --> 36:24.900
Mrs. Canning,
I'm so sorry.

36:24.950 --> 36:25.905
Simone.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.599
Simone.

36:27.650 --> 36:28.912
I'm so sorry.
How is he?

36:28.950 --> 36:30.918
He's, uh, not good.

36:30.950 --> 36:33.544
They don't think he's gonna
make it through the night.

36:33.590 --> 36:34.887
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.581
I spoke to him
earlier today--

36:36.620 --> 36:37.917
he sounded so strong.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.825
Yeah, I know, he
wanted to go to work.

36:39.860 --> 36:41.498
Thank you for coming.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.259
You know, he has all these
other lavwer friends,

36:43.300 --> 36:44.665
and not a single
one came today.

36:45.730 --> 36:47.698
I'm sorry.

36:47.730 --> 36:49.664
Do you want
to see him?
Do I...?

36:49.700 --> 36:52.009
Is he conscious?

36:52.040 --> 36:54.008
No.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.008
No, but it'll make
a difference.

36:56.040 --> 36:59.703
He wanted me to go see you
if anything went wrong.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.775
He asked me
to Vi5it you.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.776
That's Louis.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.788
Always caring for
other people.

37:05.820 --> 37:07.549
Yes.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.428
He just looks so weak.

37:12.460 --> 37:14.826
Oh, hey.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.851
Thank you.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.835
I'm gonna
let you go, okay?

37:22.870 --> 37:24.565
Is there anything
I can do?

37:24.610 --> 37:26.566
Anything--
food or anything.

37:26.610 --> 37:28.430
Um...

37:28.480 --> 37:29.879
You can pray for him.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.404
Pray for him?

37:32.450 --> 37:34.441
Pray he lives
through the night.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.616
BOTH:
Hypocrite.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.681
Okay.

37:47.030 --> 37:47.985
Grace, hi.

37:48.030 --> 37:49.292
How are you?

37:49.330 --> 37:50.456
GRACE:
Good. What's wrong?

37:50.500 --> 37:51.819
Nothing, um...

37:51.870 --> 37:53.326
I'm coming home in a minute.

37:53.370 --> 37:56.339
Can you just tell Mr. Elfman
if he gets there

37:56.370 --> 37:57.337
that I'll be home soon?

37:57.370 --> 37:58.701
Okay.

37:58.740 --> 38:00.002
And, um...

38:00.040 --> 38:01.598
one more thing.

38:01.640 --> 38:02.937
What?

38:02.980 --> 38:04.538
Can I ask you to pray for me?

38:04.580 --> 38:06.548
What?

38:06.580 --> 38:08.343
Why?

38:08.380 --> 38:10.018
There's a friend
in the hospital.

38:10.050 --> 38:12.814
He asked me to pray for him,
but I just... I-I can't.

38:12.850 --> 38:13.885
Why not?

38:13.920 --> 38:16.889
Because I-I don't believe in it.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.751
The way you do.

38:18.790 --> 38:20.553
Is that all right?

38:22.600 --> 38:23.919
Yeah.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.996
MARISSA:
How's your voice?

38:30.040 --> 38:31.029
(hoarse):
Good.

38:31.070 --> 38:32.560
Yeah, it sounds good.

38:32.610 --> 38:33.907
Good thing you went out.

38:33.940 --> 38:35.931
I just made you
some tea with lemon.

38:38.140 --> 38:39.107
Hi.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.606
Hi.

38:40.650 --> 38:44.108
Your mom's
getting ready.

38:44.150 --> 38:46.118
I'm not trying
to replace you.

38:46.150 --> 38:48.118
What?

38:48.150 --> 38:50.687
I just said that, you know,
in case you were worried.

38:53.830 --> 38:56.492
You look pretty.

38:56.530 --> 38:58.589
Thanks.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.596
Was it wrong to
ask you to pray?

39:03.640 --> 39:05.801
No, but you can, too.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.775
But it wouldn't
mean anything.

39:08.810 --> 39:12.644
It wouldn't mean anything coming
from me, either, would it?

39:14.010 --> 39:15.978
I promised someone
I'd pray for them,

39:16.020 --> 39:19.649
and then I realized it would
be hypocritical coming from me

39:19.690 --> 39:21.487
but not from you.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.112
Why did you promise?

39:23.160 --> 39:24.980
Politeness?

39:27.590 --> 39:29.751
Are you losing
your faith, Grace?

39:31.130 --> 39:32.620
No.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.638
I don't know.

39:34.670 --> 39:36.490
Ijust...

39:36.540 --> 39:37.837
It comes and goes.

39:37.870 --> 39:41.829
I hope I don't influence you
not to believe.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.836
I don't want that.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.178
I'm glad you found
something.

39:46.210 --> 39:48.713
Even if it's something
that you don't believe?

39:48.750 --> 39:50.149
Yes.

39:54.090 --> 39:56.058
Good luck_on
your interVIew.

39:56.090 --> 39:57.751
Do you know what
you're gonna say?

39:57.790 --> 39:59.087
I think I do.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.654
I love you.

40:02.660 --> 40:03.957
(knocking on door)

40:04.000 --> 40:05.661
MARISSA:
That's Mr. Elfman.

40:05.700 --> 40:06.667
Time to go.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.019
I'll be right there.

40:19.110 --> 40:20.975

come out... *

40:28.690 --> 40:30.658
I'm sorry.

40:30.690 --> 40:32.658
* That's when you hear
the sound... *

40:32.690 --> 40:34.658

40:34.700 --> 40:36.656
Yes.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.948
* Wondering if it will show...

40:53.980 --> 40:55.641
JOHNNY: It doesn't make
any sense to tell them

40:55.680 --> 40:56.908
what you know
about Bishop.

40:56.950 --> 40:58.611
Even if it's the truth?

40:58.650 --> 41:01.619
Well, here's the thing--
the truth isn't "this happened"

41:01.660 --> 41:05.118
or "that happened," the truth
to me is about doing good.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.980
And the only way to put yourself

41:07.030 --> 41:09.999
in a position to do good is
by getting elected.

41:10.030 --> 41:12.624
That's the greater truth.

41:12.670 --> 41:13.989
And if you don't get elected,

41:14.030 --> 41:15.998
somebody else is gonna
take that position,

41:16.040 --> 41:17.769
and they're gonna do
bad things with it.

41:17.800 --> 41:21.133
How do you know that I can do
better things than Prady?

41:21.170 --> 41:25.004
Because I... have
talked with you.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.506
And been with you.

41:26.550 --> 41:28.848
And I believe in you.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.745
* And he sweeps you
off your feet... *

41:30.780 --> 41:33.749
No, truth is just truth.

41:33.790 --> 41:36.759
Telling the truth,
being truthful--

41:36.790 --> 41:39.623
sometimes words have
to mean what they say,

41:39.660 --> 41:42.299
or-or else they'll just mean
whatever you want.

41:42.330 --> 41:45.299
If I tell you
I won't steal your car,

41:45.330 --> 41:47.798
but then I steal your car
because I define "steal"

41:47.830 --> 41:49.297
in a different way than you do,

41:49.340 --> 41:51.296
then how can we all be
CIVIlized together?

41:51.340 --> 41:53.308
But we're not voting
for a saint.

41:53.340 --> 41:55.308
We're voting
for a prosecutor.

41:55.340 --> 41:57.570
Thank you,
St. Alicia.

41:57.610 --> 41:59.578
Telling the
truth is...

41:59.610 --> 42:01.578
it seems like the bare
minimum for both jobs.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.815
Would you lie if you were
state's attorney?

42:03.850 --> 42:05.818
No, I wouldn't.

42:05.850 --> 42:08.045
Then I don't think
you should win.

42:08.090 --> 42:12.220
* If it's just tonight

42:12.260 --> 42:17.197
* Well, it's all in love

42:17.230 --> 42:19.198
* Love...

42:19.230 --> 42:21.198
Good-bye, Will.

* Love, love

42:24.610 --> 42:26.635
* La, la, la-la, la-la

42:26.670 --> 42:28.979
* Love, love...

42:29.010 --> 42:31.979
So don't say anything
about Bishop, okay?

42:32.010 --> 42:33.841
You can't coordinate
with the PAC.

42:33.880 --> 42:35.313
That way you had
no knowledge

42:35.350 --> 42:37.671
of who's contributed
to it and who hasn't.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.017
Okay?

42:39.050 --> 42:40.085
Okay.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.257
Okay.

42:43.290 --> 42:44.257
I'll be out here.

42:44.290 --> 42:45.359
Good luck.

42:45.390 --> 42:46.618
Thanks.

42:46.660 --> 42:47.957
Your voice
sounds better.
