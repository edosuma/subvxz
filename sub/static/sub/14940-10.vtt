without our permission,

17:41.354 --> 17:42.588

as a covert operative.

20:05.265 --> 20:07.700

intelligence for you--

20:14.275 --> 20:19.079
in exchange for a pardon
of her crimes.

to the Parish organization

20:41.601 --> 20:44.036

she was confident
that he would not

20:46.906 --> 20:49.174
question her loyalty.

20:49.242 --> 20:53.111
She'd been a disciple
of his, so to speak.

20:53.179 --> 20:56.348
Yes, so to speak.

in your opinion,

like Stanton Parish

20:59.819 --> 21:02.254
attract so many followers?

see in him?

21:04.490 --> 21:07.292

is a master manipulator.

21:07.360 --> 21:11.229
He is, quite frankly,
a sociopath.

21:11.297 --> 21:15.633
He has a very charismatic
personality.

21:15.701 --> 21:20.404

are legitimate, okay?

22:45.455 --> 22:46.789
I looked online.
No, Bill.

22:46.856 --> 22:47.990

birth certificates.

today.

just break in.

I don't want
to set him off.

23:25.854 --> 23:27.755
This is weird,
even for Gary.

23:27.823 --> 23:31.758
Gary, we know you're
concerned about the baby,

23:31.826 --> 23:34.828
but you can't keep him
from his parents.

23:34.896 --> 23:38.631
Gary, you can check
the I.D.s.

23:38.699 --> 23:41.000
Yeah, Bill, I already did
check their I.D.s.

Yeah, it's real
suspicious, huh?

23:47.340 --> 23:49.041
Yeah, it is suspicious, Bill,
'cause that's all they have.

23:49.109 --> 23:50.943
I couldn't find
anything else.

23:51.010 --> 23:52.544
There's no bank accounts
or credit cards.

to take care of him.

24:36.959 --> 24:39.728
We're all after
the same thing, aren't we?

24:39.796 --> 24:40.729
See you soon.

24:43.966 --> 24:48.537
There's something with aliens
at 8:00,

24:48.605 --> 24:51.406
or there's a chick flick
at 9:15.

24:51.474 --> 24:53.542
Obviously, you're into
the aliens.

24:53.609 --> 24:57.545
Obviously, but I'm willing
to sacrifice.

24:57.613 --> 25:00.215
John, you shouldn't
have to sacrifice.

25:00.282 --> 25:02.751
Seriously,
I'm fine with whatever.

25:02.819 --> 25:06.154
John...

25:06.222 --> 25:08.256
you deserve better
than <i>fine.</i>

25:08.324 --> 25:10.526
We both do.

25:10.594 --> 25:15.198
Listen, I think--
I don't know,

25:15.266 --> 25:17.100
I think we just
built it up too much.

25:17.168 --> 25:19.469
We just needed to get past
the first time, that's all.

25:19.537 --> 25:22.639
- You do?
- Yeah, absolutely.

25:22.707 --> 25:27.310
I mean, it wasn't terrible.

25:27.378 --> 25:30.146
Oh, God.

25:30.214 --> 25:33.650
I just--

25:33.717 --> 25:38.087
I mean, to me it felt like
you were far away.

25:38.155 --> 25:40.256
[Sighs]

25:40.324 --> 25:42.591
Look, are you sorry that--
No.

25:42.659 --> 25:44.993
I wanted this.

25:45.061 --> 25:48.730
I wanted to be with you.

25:48.798 --> 25:51.666
I guess I expected it
to be different this time.

25:51.733 --> 25:53.467
What do you mean?

25:58.139 --> 26:01.908
I was 18 my first time.

26:01.976 --> 26:06.046
And when it happened,

26:06.114 --> 26:09.349
I felt so out of control.

26:09.417 --> 26:12.953
Just so overwhelmed
by the sensations

26:13.021 --> 26:16.991
that I just completely
shut down.

26:17.058 --> 26:18.926
It's just always
been like that.

26:18.994 --> 26:23.364
Well, Rachel,
we'll get there.

26:23.432 --> 26:25.066
Okay?
You'll feel comfortable.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.341
You kept your shirt on.

26:36.712 --> 26:37.946
You don't want to see
my scars.

26:38.013 --> 26:42.116
No.
You're wrong.

26:42.184 --> 26:43.184
I do.

26:49.391 --> 26:53.161
My ex, um...

26:53.228 --> 26:57.164
she tried to be there
for me

26:57.232 --> 26:58.933
while I was recovering.

27:02.704 --> 27:06.373
She said she couldn't
stomach it.

27:06.441 --> 27:08.341
Is that how she put it?

27:08.409 --> 27:11.578
Kinda hard to forget.

27:11.645 --> 27:14.881
Mm. Well...

27:14.949 --> 27:20.787
I think...you are...
beautiful.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.094
[Gasps]

27:27.162 --> 27:29.264
Baba!

27:29.331 --> 27:30.999
What are you doing home?

27:31.067 --> 27:33.902
Your uncle
got on my nerves.

27:36.773 --> 27:38.741
This is John.

27:38.809 --> 27:40.109
Uh...

27:42.546 --> 27:44.147
Sir.

27:49.920 --> 27:53.056
I'll go check on her.

27:53.123 --> 27:57.127
- [Gasps]
- Wow. Thank you.

27:57.194 --> 28:01.230
You left me all alone
out there with your dad.

28:01.298 --> 28:04.467
- I'm sorry.
- Rachel, I'm leaving the house.

28:04.535 --> 28:07.136
I'm going shopping.

28:07.204 --> 28:10.506
I'm going for...
Two hours.

28:14.478 --> 28:15.979
- [Laughs]
- Oh, my God.

28:16.046 --> 28:17.680
No, no, it's fine,
'cause you know what?

28:17.748 --> 28:18.815
I think he liked me.

28:18.883 --> 28:21.117
Oh, shut up.

28:21.185 --> 28:24.020
We only have two hours.

28:38.067 --> 28:39.801
What do you think
you're doing here?

28:43.540 --> 28:48.543
Making sure they haven't
missed anything important.

28:48.611 --> 28:51.546
- Taking inventory?
- Yeah.

28:51.614 --> 28:53.081
Yeah, in a word.

28:53.149 --> 28:56.085
Dani's paintings
and her belongings.

28:56.152 --> 28:58.721
Just want to make sure
they're protected.

28:58.788 --> 29:02.557
Wow. You want
to protect her things.

29:05.862 --> 29:08.931
What are you doing here,
Cameron?

29:08.999 --> 29:10.265
Well, Cley's back
at our office

29:10.333 --> 29:11.833
rifling through our stuff.

29:11.901 --> 29:14.202
You're seriously gonna
trust this to him?

29:14.270 --> 29:15.937
Yes. Yes, for now,
I'm letting

29:16.005 --> 29:18.006
the experienced authorities
make all the decisions.

29:18.073 --> 29:19.307
No, <i>you're</i> the experienced
authority.

29:19.375 --> 29:21.709
Yeah, look where my expertise
has led us.

29:21.777 --> 29:24.011
What, you're just gonna hand
this entire thing over to him?

29:24.079 --> 29:27.215
Parish killed Dani!
I know that.

29:27.282 --> 29:29.150
You think I need you
to tell me that?

29:30.819 --> 29:33.621
She's my daughter.

29:33.688 --> 29:35.923
She was.

29:35.991 --> 29:39.628
Now look at you
just sitting there,

29:39.695 --> 29:42.030
not doing anything
to find her killer.

29:42.098 --> 29:44.700
Well, where the hell
do you think I should be?

29:51.141 --> 29:53.376
[Door slams]

30:00.851 --> 30:03.219
Gary would never harm
your baby.

30:03.287 --> 30:05.488
He's just trying
to protect him.

30:05.556 --> 30:08.124
- Protect him from what?
- It doesn't make any sense.

30:08.191 --> 30:10.526
Gary's autistic.
It's very hard for him

30:10.593 --> 30:12.194
to make connections
with people.

30:12.262 --> 30:16.565
But for some reason, he's found
a connection with Adam.

30:16.633 --> 30:19.868
He's been able to hold him.
He's been very caring.

30:19.935 --> 30:22.103
Which is very unusual
for Gary, believe me.

30:22.171 --> 30:23.538
This is what I'm thinking.

30:23.606 --> 30:25.373
What if your nanny
was right?

30:25.441 --> 30:29.311
What if Adam has some sort
of ability

30:29.378 --> 30:30.946
that's affecting Gary?

30:31.013 --> 30:33.181
He's an Alpha?

30:33.249 --> 30:34.649
We don't believe
in that.

30:34.717 --> 30:36.684
Okay, well,
let's call Dr. Rosen--

30:36.752 --> 30:39.120
No!

30:39.188 --> 30:41.856
Rosen is able
to reach Gary.

30:41.924 --> 30:43.391
He'll be able
to see whether

30:43.459 --> 30:44.292
there's something
that's affecting him.

30:44.360 --> 30:45.927
Absolutely not.

30:45.994 --> 30:47.428
We don't want that man
anywhere near our child.

30:47.496 --> 30:48.729
That's how
this whole thing began.

30:48.797 --> 30:50.398
Fair enough.

30:50.465 --> 30:52.232
Why don't you go take a seat
in my office.

30:52.300 --> 30:55.369
Sit tight. We'll get you
and your son out of here.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.837
You got a half hour
or we're calling the police.

30:56.905 --> 31:00.541
We want our baby back.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.409
All right,
we need to split them up

31:02.477 --> 31:04.245
and ask them
some more questions.

31:04.312 --> 31:06.680
You ready to do your thing?
Oh, yeah.

31:10.775 --> 31:12.176
Well, the funny thing,
Mr. Kessler,

31:12.244 --> 31:14.011
is we can't seem to find
any record

31:14.079 --> 31:15.325
of you or your wife.

31:15.326 --> 31:17.494
No home records,
no loans...

31:18.062 --> 31:20.063
What does that have to do
with this?

31:20.130 --> 31:22.032
Just get my son
out of that room.

31:22.099 --> 31:26.970
I'm afraid I'm not gonna
be able to do that just yet.

31:27.038 --> 31:29.039
What's he talking
to Brian about?

31:29.107 --> 31:31.742
[Voice distorted] Just relax
and tell me the truth.

31:34.946 --> 31:37.115
This tea is terrible.

31:37.182 --> 31:40.184
And I love your perfume.

31:40.252 --> 31:42.120
Are you the baby's
parents?

31:42.188 --> 31:46.091
No.

31:46.159 --> 31:48.694
He doesn't have
real parents.

31:48.761 --> 31:50.429
Can I get some cream?

31:50.497 --> 31:53.366
Who's the lady who brought
the baby to Gary?

31:53.434 --> 31:55.602
She took care of the kid
at the lab.

31:58.806 --> 32:00.874
Your friend's
in big trouble.

32:00.942 --> 32:03.410
You either knock down that door,
or I call the police.

32:03.478 --> 32:08.948
You wanna call the police?
Call 'em.

32:09.016 --> 32:10.816
Go right ahead.

32:13.487 --> 32:16.621
They do stuff with genetics
or something.

32:16.689 --> 32:18.923
I think they've got
four other babies now.

32:18.991 --> 32:20.658
[Distorted voice]
Who sent you?

32:20.726 --> 32:24.028
Mr. Murphy called and said,
"get the kid out of here.

32:24.095 --> 32:26.364
"No muss, no fuss.

32:26.431 --> 32:28.800
"But if things get tricky,

32:28.868 --> 32:32.470
show them who
they're dealing with."

32:32.538 --> 32:37.542
If you don't want to call,
I will.

32:43.448 --> 32:45.816
[Gasping]

32:49.153 --> 32:51.221
Yeah, I'm one
of those people.

32:52.757 --> 32:54.024
Bastard.

32:54.091 --> 32:57.226
Well, me too.

33:37.301 --> 33:39.202
I don't think so.

33:46.309 --> 33:49.445
Bitch.

33:56.086 --> 33:58.721
- Do your thing.
- He's holding the kid.

33:58.789 --> 34:01.657
- Give him to me.
- No. No way.

34:01.725 --> 34:03.559
Have it your way.

34:07.630 --> 34:10.665
[Grunting, crying out]

34:10.733 --> 34:12.033
[Distorted voice]
Go to sleep.

34:13.868 --> 34:16.737
Bitch.

34:16.804 --> 34:20.072
Yeah, you see?
I told you. I was right.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.141
Yeah, Gary,
you were right.

34:22.208 --> 34:26.079
They never listen to me.

34:52.141 --> 34:54.742
Dr. Rosen, if you will,

34:54.810 --> 34:57.345
please turn your attention
to the final event

34:57.412 --> 34:59.180
in Weehawken.

34:59.248 --> 35:03.151
After the detonation
of the voltaic grenades,

35:03.218 --> 35:07.589
several electrical towers
were destroyed and...

35:07.656 --> 35:13.361
All of the lights in the area
had gone out.

35:13.429 --> 35:20.168
Danielle was in the direct path
of the blast.

35:20.236 --> 35:26.141
[Panting]

35:26.208 --> 35:29.410
Um...
[Clears throat]

35:29.478 --> 35:33.915
Her injuries were--
were quite severe.

35:33.982 --> 35:38.085
Dani? Dani, look at me.
Look at me.

35:38.153 --> 35:40.755
- [Gasping]
- Dani, I love you.

35:40.823 --> 35:44.892
And, uh...

35:48.097 --> 35:51.799
She expired.

36:09.285 --> 36:10.886
It's my responsibility,

36:10.954 --> 36:14.190
whatever happens to Cameron
or Dani or anyone.

36:14.257 --> 36:15.959
It's my responsibility.

36:16.026 --> 36:18.461
You shouldn't have
to carry that alone.

36:18.529 --> 36:20.230
Yes, I should.

36:20.298 --> 36:23.100
[Gasping]

36:32.410 --> 36:34.711
God.

36:48.685 --> 36:52.655
Lee, I'm so sorry
to have brought you here.

36:54.111 --> 36:56.422
That's all right, Nina.

36:56.424 --> 36:57.724
Where's Gary?

36:57.792 --> 37:01.061
He's in the lab.

37:01.129 --> 37:03.963
Gary, you have
a very high level

37:04.031 --> 37:06.066
of vasopressin
in your bloodstream, so--

37:06.133 --> 37:07.968
Oh. That doesn't
sound good.

37:08.036 --> 37:09.936
It's all right, Gary.
It's nothing to worry about.

37:10.004 --> 37:14.374
It's a hormone
that increases the instinct

37:14.442 --> 37:16.276
to protect one's child.

37:16.344 --> 37:19.179
It's typically found
in high levels in new fathers.

37:19.247 --> 37:21.182
I'm not his father.
I only just met him today.

37:21.249 --> 37:24.618
Yes, I know.
I just believe that Adam here--

37:24.686 --> 37:27.320
No, Benjamin.
Or Kyle.

37:27.388 --> 37:29.723
Well, whatever his name is
has the ability

37:29.791 --> 37:31.925
to induce production
of the hormone

37:31.993 --> 37:35.896
in anyone who's nearby--
in close proximity

37:35.964 --> 37:37.564
or in contact with him.

37:37.632 --> 37:40.167
It doesn't necessarily have
to be the birth parent either.

37:40.234 --> 37:42.903
He can inspire...

37:42.971 --> 37:46.140
inspire what all babies need...

37:46.207 --> 37:47.942
care and protection.

37:48.009 --> 37:51.011
Hi, Bill.

37:51.079 --> 37:53.113
- Good to see you, Doc.
- You too.

37:53.181 --> 37:55.315
How'd it go
at the laboratory?

37:55.383 --> 37:57.384
Well, they busted everyone.

37:57.452 --> 37:59.020
Of course,
no one's talking.

37:59.088 --> 38:00.255
They're still looking
for Magda, though.

38:00.322 --> 38:01.856
Are the other babies
all right?

38:01.924 --> 38:03.425
They seem to be.

38:03.492 --> 38:05.927
They placed 'em all
in secure foster homes.

38:05.994 --> 38:08.363
Well, I should probably
have a look at them too.

38:08.430 --> 38:10.365
Gary, this is a vasopressin
antagonist.

38:10.433 --> 38:12.067
It will reduce
the concentration

38:12.134 --> 38:13.301
in your bloodstream
very quickly.

38:13.369 --> 38:15.904
- I have to drink this?
- Yes, please.

38:15.972 --> 38:20.475
- That--come on.
- Just hold your breath.

38:20.543 --> 38:23.879
- Eww, it's filthy.
- It's not filthy, Gary.

38:23.947 --> 38:25.715
Magda must have
taken that, right?

38:25.782 --> 38:29.152
Unless she felt like this was
the safest place for him.

38:29.219 --> 38:32.790
That makes sense.

38:32.857 --> 38:36.260
- Gary, you were incredible.
- Huh.

38:36.328 --> 38:38.630
You protected him
when we almost gave him away.

38:38.697 --> 38:40.865
Yeah, I was incredible.
I protected him.

38:40.933 --> 38:42.901
- Gary, may I?
- Oh.

38:42.969 --> 38:45.938
Oh, yeah.
You have to be careful.

38:46.005 --> 38:48.440
Hey, little one.
Hi there.

38:48.508 --> 38:50.843
Can you squeeze
my finger?

38:50.911 --> 38:52.711
Hey.
He had a rough day.

38:52.779 --> 38:54.580
He's doing fine.

38:54.648 --> 38:56.482
He's lucky he won't
remember it.

38:56.549 --> 38:58.317
Hopefully.

38:58.385 --> 39:01.487
He'll learn young to put
all the rough stuff behind him

39:01.555 --> 39:02.922
and move on with life.

39:02.990 --> 39:05.657
Right?
Huh, little guy?

39:05.725 --> 39:07.526
- You have a go.
- Come here.

39:07.594 --> 39:09.495
Hurts my back.

39:09.562 --> 39:14.199
Hey. Hey. Hmm?

39:14.267 --> 39:18.804
[Kisses baby]
Oh...

39:25.112 --> 39:26.646
Better?

39:26.714 --> 39:29.249
I think I figured out
what your Alpha ability is.

39:29.316 --> 39:31.051
[Chuckles]

39:31.118 --> 39:33.186
But we should keep
practicing.

39:33.254 --> 39:35.689
Uh, isn't your dad
gonna be home soon?

39:35.756 --> 39:38.759
I don't care.

39:43.264 --> 39:46.967
[Sighs]
What a day.

39:47.035 --> 39:48.836
No whining, Bill.

39:48.903 --> 39:51.004
We can only have one baby
in the house.

39:51.072 --> 39:52.072
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

39:52.140 --> 39:54.207
Are you kidding me?

39:54.275 --> 39:56.176
I'm still in shock
that you are.

39:56.244 --> 39:58.478
Well, you know,
sometimes life can be rough,

39:58.546 --> 40:00.414
but you just have to grab
the good stuff

40:00.481 --> 40:02.215
when it happens, right?

40:02.283 --> 40:04.651
Oh, and everyone thinks
you're such a tough guy.

40:04.719 --> 40:07.487
This is just until we find
a safe place for him.

40:07.555 --> 40:09.890
We have a safe place
for him.

40:09.958 --> 40:11.892
We don't know anything
about this kid.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.561
So we're still gonna have
to take that stuff, you know.

40:14.629 --> 40:16.596
No, I know, I know.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.432
Just look at him, Bill.

40:18.499 --> 40:21.801
He's perfect.

40:41.922 --> 40:44.890
I know you blame me
for all of this, Cameron.

40:44.957 --> 40:50.161
Well, I do too.

40:50.229 --> 40:54.132
I had her in my arms.

40:54.199 --> 40:58.269
I could have stopped her,
but I let her go.

41:08.847 --> 41:10.648
Whatever you're feeling
right now,

41:10.716 --> 41:13.450
we did not kill her.

41:13.518 --> 41:16.620
Someone else did.

41:16.688 --> 41:20.057
He used her,
then he killed her

41:20.125 --> 41:23.494
when she got in his way.

41:23.562 --> 41:25.296
You know that if Cley
catches Parish,

41:25.363 --> 41:27.431
he'll put him in prison.

41:30.468 --> 41:32.969
He doesn't deserve
to go to prison.

41:33.037 --> 41:38.141
No. No, he doesn't.

41:40.310 --> 41:42.777
I'm gonna need your help.
