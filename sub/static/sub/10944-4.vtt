00:00.384 --> 00:02.418
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:04.554 --> 00:06.022
<i>Phoenix!</i>

00:06.991 --> 00:09.001
Lisa! Oh my gosh!

00:11.595 --> 00:13.395
I thought I was picking you up
at the airport.

00:13.462 --> 00:14.562
Yeah, I caught an earlier flight

00:14.630 --> 00:16.331
because I couldn't wait to see you.

00:16.399 --> 00:19.367
When I first showed up here
with Shane, last year,

00:19.435 --> 00:21.770
you made it perfectly clear
that any relationship

00:21.838 --> 00:23.005
<i>wasn't gonna happen.</i>

00:23.072 --> 00:24.506
Well, I don't...

00:24.573 --> 00:25.607
Who are you?

00:25.675 --> 00:27.309
Cassandra Fay.

00:27.376 --> 00:28.810
<i>I'm Scott's new vet assistant.</i>

00:32.080 --> 00:33.314
Who are you?

00:33.381 --> 00:35.283
And what are you doing on my horse?

00:41.090 --> 00:43.124
<i>Come on, Spartan.</i>

00:43.192 --> 00:44.459
Ugh! That kid!

00:46.528 --> 00:48.596
Hey! Georgie!

00:48.664 --> 00:49.930
Do you have a death wish or something?

00:49.998 --> 00:52.299
Amy doesn't let anyone
ride Spartan -

00:52.368 --> 00:54.134
no one, not even me.

00:54.202 --> 00:56.804
Maybe. But she let me.

00:56.872 --> 00:58.339
Or maybe, you're delusional.

00:58.407 --> 00:59.841
Do yourself a favour

00:59.908 --> 01:01.475
and get off that horse
before Amy catches you.

01:01.542 --> 01:03.309
No way.
It was her idea,

01:03.378 --> 01:04.911
and she said if I get really good

01:04.979 --> 01:06.380
she'll give me jumping lessons.

01:06.447 --> 01:08.114
Yeah, right.

01:08.182 --> 01:09.983
You don't believe me, ask her.

01:10.050 --> 01:13.019
Did you say she
could ride Spartan?

01:13.087 --> 01:15.822
She won't believe me
that you let me ride your horse.

01:15.890 --> 01:18.624
Well, why don't you get
riding him then, hmm?

01:20.927 --> 01:22.995
You're giving
her jumping lessons,

01:23.062 --> 01:24.697
but not me?

01:24.765 --> 01:26.298
<i>Since when do you
want jumping lessons?</i>

01:26.366 --> 01:27.466
You don't remember?

01:27.534 --> 01:29.668
I used to beg you to teach me to jump.

01:29.736 --> 01:30.770
Well, yeah, I remember,

01:30.837 --> 01:32.504
but that was ages ago.

01:32.571 --> 01:33.705
And besides, I thought
that had something to do

01:33.773 --> 01:35.973
with Jake and some girl.

01:36.041 --> 01:37.675
Way to dredge up the past.

01:37.743 --> 01:40.244
Well, I just didn't feel like
you were very committed.

01:40.312 --> 01:41.513
Maybe then.

01:41.580 --> 01:42.947
But now, I have gone
from commitment-phobe

01:43.015 --> 01:44.783
to commitment freak.

01:44.850 --> 01:46.618
Really.
You jumping.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.420
When do we start?

01:52.256 --> 01:54.124
Well, good morning.

01:54.191 --> 01:56.627
Hi. I should've called, sorry.

01:56.694 --> 01:58.328
No. I'm happy to see you.

01:58.396 --> 01:59.696
Here, let me get you a coffee.

01:59.764 --> 02:01.732
No. I've had plenty, thanks.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.600
I know, it's not the good stuff

02:03.668 --> 02:05.568
we used to drink in France.

02:05.636 --> 02:08.002
Speaking of France...

02:08.071 --> 02:10.072
Oh! That's a...
some kind of TV.

02:10.139 --> 02:12.875
No. It's a digital
picture frame.

02:12.943 --> 02:15.778
I downloaded all our pictures
from France.

02:15.846 --> 02:17.012
It has...

02:17.080 --> 02:19.114
Music.

02:20.850 --> 02:22.216
Isn't that great?

02:22.284 --> 02:23.217
Isn't that better than pictures
in an album?

02:23.285 --> 02:24.352
Jack!

02:24.420 --> 02:26.254
You busy?
Oh! Hi, Lisa.

02:26.322 --> 02:27.956
Hi.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.624
What do we have here?

02:29.692 --> 02:32.994
<i>Is this a music video</i>
<i>of your trip to France,</i>

02:33.062 --> 02:34.429
starring - ahh! - You!

02:36.365 --> 02:38.198
What do you want?

02:38.266 --> 02:41.234
Oh, Miranda and Shane
are coming by today.

02:41.302 --> 02:42.570
Oh, congratulations!

02:42.637 --> 02:44.204
I heard that Shane got into
an exclusive school.

02:44.272 --> 02:46.006
Exclusive and expensive.

02:46.942 --> 02:51.244
<i>You know, which is why I need</i>
<i>to talk to old Jacques here.</i>

02:51.312 --> 02:52.645
Right now?

02:52.713 --> 02:53.980
Well... uh...

02:55.483 --> 02:56.983
Yeah... r-right now.

02:57.651 --> 02:59.719
In fact, really right away

02:59.787 --> 03:01.521
'cause I'm busy later.

03:01.589 --> 03:02.822
Oh, all right.

03:05.392 --> 03:06.359
We won't be too long.

03:06.426 --> 03:08.494
Oh, of course not.

03:10.797 --> 03:12.998
<i>So how long does
that thing run anyway?</i>

03:13.065 --> 03:15.934
Plugged in,
it'll run on a loop forever.

03:16.002 --> 03:18.169
Whoa!
Is that right?

03:19.138 --> 03:21.540
What side is the right ventricle on?

03:21.608 --> 03:23.509
It's on the right side.

03:23.576 --> 03:25.309
Correct!

03:25.377 --> 03:27.344
Caleb, you gotta ask me a
real question, man. Come on.

03:27.412 --> 03:29.680
Explain to me the flow of blood
through the heart.

03:29.748 --> 03:31.415
Okay, um...

03:32.350 --> 03:34.585
Deoxigenated blood from the body

03:34.653 --> 03:37.154
enters the right atrium
through the superior

03:37.222 --> 03:38.122
and inferior vena cava-

03:39.658 --> 03:42.592
Like anybody actually knows
how the damn thing works.

03:42.660 --> 03:43.927
What're you talking about?

03:43.995 --> 03:45.962
The same thing you are, my friend.

03:46.030 --> 03:49.599
The heart - the mysteries
of the human heart.

03:49.667 --> 03:51.167
Caleb, this isn't a joke, man.

03:51.235 --> 03:52.936
I gotta learn this stuff,
okay? Come on.

03:53.004 --> 03:54.838
Oh? Well, try being a bull rider
on the circuit.

03:54.906 --> 03:56.172
You know, the average age
is twenty-one.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.040
That puts me four years past my prime,

03:58.107 --> 04:00.175
and that is not an easy thing
for any man to comprehend.

04:00.243 --> 04:01.476
Okay, um...

04:01.545 --> 04:02.778
I'd love to have
this conversation with you

04:02.846 --> 04:04.146
right now...

04:04.213 --> 04:05.614
I need to shine.
I've gotta peak this year.

04:05.682 --> 04:07.215
And I will have this conversation

04:07.283 --> 04:09.018
after my exam.

04:10.887 --> 04:13.555
It's not just the tuition, Jack.

04:13.622 --> 04:15.657
It's the uniform
and the class trips-

04:15.724 --> 04:17.458
So what, you brought me
all the way out here

04:17.526 --> 04:19.260
just to tell me you're broke?

04:19.327 --> 04:20.928
You want me to take you
back to the Maison?

04:20.995 --> 04:22.463
You can look at a few more
pictures of France with Lisa.

04:22.531 --> 04:23.731
Fine! Fine.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.100
Just let's get this over with.

04:26.168 --> 04:27.735
Okay, don't look.

04:28.670 --> 04:31.038
What if I told you that
there was a healthy red meat

04:31.105 --> 04:33.006
with all the flavour of beef,

04:33.074 --> 04:35.709
raised locally, sold locally,

04:35.777 --> 04:37.010
one hundred percent organic.

04:37.078 --> 04:38.411
It's where the smart money is,

04:38.479 --> 04:40.413
and it's a sure thing.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.282
You own race horses, Tim,

04:42.349 --> 04:44.051
you oughta know there's
no such thing as a sure thing.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.318
But if there was?

04:49.656 --> 04:50.723
You're looking at it.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.494
Buffalo.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.162
Some call it buffalo,
some call it bison.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.564
You can call it whatever you want,

04:58.632 --> 05:01.132
but I am gonna call
that big fella our future.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.635
And that is your retirement in France.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.737
Who said anything about retirement?

05:05.805 --> 05:09.774
Oh yeah, I wanna work
till the day we drop too.

05:09.842 --> 05:10.976
Get serious.

05:11.043 --> 05:13.111
We buy this bull and a couple of cows,

05:13.178 --> 05:16.147
we are in the organic
bison meat business,

05:16.215 --> 05:18.882
<i>and we are printing money.</i>

05:19.851 --> 05:22.086
Come on, what do you say?

05:22.153 --> 05:26.724
Well, there's no doubt
that is one fine looking animal.

05:28.727 --> 05:32.362
But I've been burned by you
in the past.

05:32.430 --> 05:34.330
Okay. But...

05:36.834 --> 05:39.936
Can't we be bullish about the future?

Is Peter's still in Vancouver?

06:28.482 --> 06:30.383
Yeah, he was supposed
to be back yesterday,

06:30.450 --> 06:32.085
but he had to stay an extra night.

06:32.153 --> 06:33.153
Wow, it can't be easy for you.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.520
But, I mean, now that I'm around,

06:34.588 --> 06:36.989
I'd be more than happy
to help you out with whatever.

06:37.057 --> 06:38.791
Thank you, I appreciate that.

06:39.193 --> 06:40.693
You know, it's actually
a really big deal,

06:40.761 --> 06:42.129
transitioning your child from a crib

06:42.196 --> 06:43.130
to a big girl's bed.

06:43.197 --> 06:44.197
I bet.

06:44.265 --> 06:45.565
And with all the mommy bloggers,

06:45.633 --> 06:46.866
there's like endless chat

06:46.934 --> 06:48.869
about the exact right time to do it.

06:48.989 --> 06:50.776
I don't pay much attention
to that sort of thing.

06:50.898 --> 06:51.998
But Katie refuses to sleep in her crib

06:52.066 --> 06:53.431
these days anyway.

06:53.499 --> 06:55.433
She only wants to sleep
in mommy and daddy's bed.

06:55.501 --> 06:56.634
And I'm not against co-sleeping,

06:56.703 --> 06:58.403
but it definitely has its drawbacks.

06:58.470 --> 07:00.605
Well, I think it depends on
who you're sleeping with.

07:02.709 --> 07:05.677
Oh my God, it's like
I'm always on the job.

07:05.745 --> 07:07.345
You kidding me?

07:07.413 --> 07:09.646
Hello, Martin,
I have a baby, remember?

07:09.715 --> 07:11.716
What's wrong?
Who's Martin?

07:11.783 --> 07:14.318
He's um...
He's my boss.

07:14.385 --> 07:15.519
Last week he asked me to go

07:15.587 --> 07:17.788
to this month long securities course.

07:17.856 --> 07:19.456
But, seriously, a month in New York?

07:19.524 --> 07:21.125
Sweet.

07:21.193 --> 07:24.294
I was at a hotel in Vegas
called New York, New York once.

07:24.362 --> 07:26.229
Yeah, but now he's all,
"Hello, Lou, it's crucial

07:26.296 --> 07:27.697
to your situation
at Hubbard Financial."

07:27.765 --> 07:29.498
Suddenly it's crucial?

07:29.566 --> 07:32.702
Like you'll get fired if you don't go?

07:32.770 --> 07:35.371
Yeah, pretty much.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.047
Hey, where's the boy wonder?

07:45.115 --> 07:46.949
Oh, he couldn't make it.

07:47.951 --> 07:48.984
What?

07:49.052 --> 07:50.385
Yeah, it's pretty great, really.

07:50.453 --> 07:51.886
He wrote this play

07:51.954 --> 07:54.521
and it's being produced
by the drama class.

07:54.589 --> 07:56.057
A play.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.993
Yeah, he didn't wanna miss rehearsals.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.162
Since when is a rehearsal
more important

08:01.230 --> 08:02.296
than spending time with his dad?

08:02.364 --> 08:03.364
Oh, come on,

08:03.431 --> 08:04.866
he's had plans with his friends.

08:04.933 --> 08:06.400
You know how kids are at that age.

08:06.468 --> 08:08.568
Yeah, well, I had plans too.

08:08.636 --> 08:09.803
I'm thinking of buying this buffalo.

08:09.871 --> 08:11.337
I wanted him to see that.

08:11.405 --> 08:12.572
And then tomorrow,

08:12.640 --> 08:14.474
I thought we'd go on a trail ride.

08:14.541 --> 08:17.210
Well, I'll pass on the buffalo,

08:17.278 --> 08:19.679
but I'll go for a trail ride.

08:19.747 --> 08:21.081
It could give us an opportunity

08:21.149 --> 08:22.649
to talk about Shane's future.

08:22.716 --> 08:25.517
You drive six hours to talk to me?

08:25.585 --> 08:27.519
Could've done that over the phone.

08:27.587 --> 08:31.423
Thank you for reminding me
what a jerk you can be.

08:31.491 --> 08:32.624
Okay, all right.
Okay!

08:32.692 --> 08:34.558
Wait. You're right.

08:35.528 --> 08:37.163
I am being a jerk.

08:37.230 --> 08:39.597
I'm just disappointed.

08:40.532 --> 08:42.600
I just wanted to see my son,
that's all -

08:42.668 --> 08:45.069
And you!
That goes without saying.

08:47.606 --> 08:49.340
So just stay -

08:49.408 --> 08:52.911
please, come on -
at least for dinner.

09:00.218 --> 09:01.251
Hey.
Hey.

09:04.222 --> 09:05.155
Essential biology.

09:05.223 --> 09:06.323
Yeah.

09:06.390 --> 09:08.558
Yeah. That course
was no fun at all.

09:08.626 --> 09:10.794
I only passed because I had a tutor,

09:10.861 --> 09:12.394
and only because he was hot.

09:13.997 --> 09:15.131
Well, I don't think
my girlfriend would appreciate

09:15.199 --> 09:17.066
the hot tutor idea.

09:17.134 --> 09:18.234
Girlfriend, huh?

09:18.302 --> 09:20.669
Yeah. Is she in Sciences too?

09:20.737 --> 09:21.904
Uh, no.

09:21.972 --> 09:23.906
Actually, she works with horses.

09:23.974 --> 09:25.774
Well, as long as
she can read and write,

09:25.843 --> 09:28.143
she can quiz you
on the chapter reviews.

09:28.211 --> 09:30.879
Providing she's not too much
of a distraction,

09:30.947 --> 09:33.481
if you know what I mean.

09:37.086 --> 09:39.054
Okay, so I want you to trot
into the line

09:39.121 --> 09:41.689
and really focus on
your position and your posture,

09:41.757 --> 09:44.291
not necessarily the jumps.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.760
What are you waiting for?

09:46.828 --> 09:50.464
For my heart rate
to go back to normal.

09:50.531 --> 09:52.699
Okay, you know, Mallory,

09:52.767 --> 09:54.468
show jumping is an extreme sport

09:54.535 --> 09:56.303
and not everybody's cut out for it.

09:56.371 --> 09:57.771
I understand that.

09:57.839 --> 09:59.239
I just didn't think
we'd be starting off

09:59.306 --> 10:01.107
at the grand prix level.

10:02.042 --> 10:04.344
Okay, we'll lower the jumps.

10:04.411 --> 10:06.712
Do they even go any lower?

10:06.780 --> 10:08.147
<i>Not necessary.</i>

10:08.215 --> 10:10.750
I'm good.
I'm definitely good.

10:12.419 --> 10:13.452
Okay.

10:14.621 --> 10:16.154
When you're ready.

10:22.661 --> 10:24.096
Hey, that looks great!

10:24.163 --> 10:25.430
Good job!

10:25.498 --> 10:27.599
<i>Shorten your reins!</i>

10:27.666 --> 10:28.934
<i>Steady now.</i>
<i>Steady now.</i>

10:29.002 --> 10:30.502
Whoa! Whoa!

10:30.569 --> 10:32.336
Aghhhh!

10:35.974 --> 10:37.275
You okay?

10:38.710 --> 10:40.711
It's all right.

10:40.779 --> 10:43.080
You know, my mom once said

10:43.148 --> 10:44.715
that you can't call yourself
a true rider

10:44.783 --> 10:47.350
until you've fallen off
at least twenty times.

10:47.418 --> 10:49.219
Nineteen more to go.

10:49.287 --> 10:51.021
Something to look forward to.

10:55.026 --> 10:56.592
Hey, Ty...

10:56.660 --> 10:57.760
I was just wondering,

10:57.828 --> 11:00.096
if, uh, you're not busy,

11:00.164 --> 11:02.498
maybe you could help me out...

11:02.566 --> 11:04.633
As like a study buddy?

11:04.700 --> 11:06.201
Great.

11:06.269 --> 11:08.137
But you have to promise
that we're gonna study, okay?

11:08.204 --> 11:09.671
Just study.

11:09.739 --> 11:10.906
Okay.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.107
All right.
I'll talk to you later.

11:12.175 --> 11:14.810
Okay, bye! Hey, Ty, was that Scott?

11:14.877 --> 11:16.211
No. It was Amy.

11:16.279 --> 11:19.347
Hey! What's the deal on
a bison bull fertility test.

11:19.415 --> 11:20.881
What's the deal there?

11:20.950 --> 11:22.450
First, you have to do
a full clinical examination-

11:22.517 --> 11:23.952
No, no. The cost,
the cost.

11:24.019 --> 11:25.820
How much does it cost?

11:25.887 --> 11:27.088
Well, you gotta factor in

11:27.156 --> 11:28.289
what Scott charges for a vet call,

11:28.357 --> 11:29.424
and then there's
the lab work that-

11:29.491 --> 11:31.092
See? That's the problem
with vets;

11:31.160 --> 11:32.160
can't get a simple test.

11:32.227 --> 11:33.995
It's not like I necessarily wanna

11:34.063 --> 11:37.497
put Scott's unborn children
through college.

11:37.565 --> 11:38.598
Okay.

11:38.666 --> 11:40.700
What do you think that the odds are

11:40.768 --> 11:42.102
of a bull being...

11:42.170 --> 11:44.171
you know, shooting blanks?

11:44.238 --> 11:45.638
This is animal physiology.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.440
I just read this chapter
on bovine reproduction-

11:46.507 --> 11:49.409
Be honest.
Be honest.

11:49.477 --> 11:50.844
I think it's like one percent
of all breeding bulls

11:50.911 --> 11:53.612
are infertile -
I think.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.481
Okay, so not this bull.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.548
This bull's all bull.

11:56.616 --> 11:57.783
It's like he'd be a 99 percenter,

11:57.851 --> 11:59.418
not part of the wimpy one percent.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.487
That's good.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.588
Okay.

12:04.858 --> 12:08.826
Twenty-five hundred pounds
of pure plains bison,

12:08.894 --> 12:12.063
and it goes by registered name
"Ladies Man."

12:12.131 --> 12:13.131
And is he?

12:13.199 --> 12:14.366
All I know is that

12:14.433 --> 12:15.900
he's a mighty fine looking animal.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.136
Ah, see? You're
warming to the idea, Jack.

12:18.204 --> 12:19.204
I knew it.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.605
You and me,
fifty-fifty?

12:23.174 --> 12:24.641
The livestock
business is in your blood.

12:24.709 --> 12:26.776
Do it.

12:26.844 --> 12:28.979
Woo-hoo!

12:29.047 --> 12:30.347
You won't regret it, buddy.

12:30.415 --> 12:31.815
Yeah, well,
the proof's in the pudding,

12:31.883 --> 12:34.418
or in this case, the progeny.

12:34.486 --> 12:35.785
What does that mean?

12:35.853 --> 12:37.954
It means, I'll tell you
when you're older.

12:38.023 --> 12:40.056
Have you had him tested?

12:40.124 --> 12:41.491
No one's stupid
enough to buy a bull

12:41.558 --> 12:43.692
without having it tested.

12:43.760 --> 12:44.727
I'm gonna get dessert.

12:44.794 --> 12:46.996
Hey, speaking of progeny,

12:47.064 --> 12:50.400
Miranda says that Shane is
pulling down A's at school.

12:50.467 --> 12:52.201
Hmm. That's great.

12:52.302 --> 12:53.669
He's doing okay.

12:53.737 --> 12:55.803
Miranda, what did you do early on

12:55.871 --> 12:58.640
in order to encourage
his cognitive development?

12:58.707 --> 13:00.075
His "cognitive development."

13:00.143 --> 13:01.576
<i>Yes.</i>

13:01.644 --> 13:05.480
Um, well, he could count cards
before he could read,

13:05.548 --> 13:08.050
and he could read
before he started kindergarten.

13:08.117 --> 13:10.118
My son! Our son!

13:11.786 --> 13:13.987
But, I mean, you were
a working mom, right?

13:14.056 --> 13:15.789
How did you manage?

13:15.857 --> 13:18.192
Luckily, I had some really
good girlfriends to help out.

13:18.260 --> 13:19.460
You could just leave
him with girlfriends

13:19.528 --> 13:20.528
when he was a baby?

13:20.595 --> 13:21.828
<i>That's nothing.</i>

13:21.896 --> 13:23.864
When I was little,
my mom left me and my dad

13:23.932 --> 13:25.866
for a fling with a rodeo clown
from Albuquerque.

13:25.934 --> 13:27.267
<i>Look at me, I turned out just fine.</i>

13:27.334 --> 13:30.203
So, I mean, you've got nothing
to worry about.

13:30.271 --> 13:31.737
What does that mean,
"Nothing to worry about"?

13:33.307 --> 13:34.840
New York for a month, right?

13:38.011 --> 13:40.080
What's that?

13:40.147 --> 13:42.515
The securities course
that I told you about.

13:42.583 --> 13:44.216
No, you didn't.
Yeah, I did.

13:44.284 --> 13:45.850
You didn't tell me it was for a month.

13:45.918 --> 13:46.851
Well, you didn't ask. What
do you mean, I didn't ask?

13:46.919 --> 13:48.787
What does that have to do with it?

13:48.854 --> 13:50.389
I didn't bother
getting into details

13:50.457 --> 13:53.092
because Martin said it was optional.

13:53.159 --> 13:54.226
And then what?

13:54.294 --> 13:55.561
So now he's just changed his tune,

13:55.628 --> 13:57.662
or did you forget that
you have an 18-month-old baby

13:57.730 --> 13:59.197
at home?
You know what?

13:59.264 --> 14:01.399
Some working moms
have more flexibility.

14:01.467 --> 14:02.833
Their partners don't spend
all their time

14:02.901 --> 14:04.569
working in Vancouver.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.472
So it's my fault
that you're not going?

14:07.539 --> 14:10.208
You know what?
You said it, not me.

14:10.275 --> 14:11.242
Where are you going?

14:11.310 --> 14:12.376
Can we talk about this, please?

14:12.444 --> 14:13.177
You know what?
It's Katie's first night

14:13.245 --> 14:14.412
in her big-girl bed.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.215
So whatever it is, it can wait, right?

14:47.010 --> 14:48.042
Hey...

15:15.470 --> 15:16.470
Agh!

15:17.539 --> 15:19.072
Whoaaaaa!

15:37.724 --> 15:40.586
One down, nineteen to go.

15:46.803 --> 15:49.838
<i>Which nucleotides</i>
<i>are considered, uh...</i>

15:49.906 --> 15:51.606
Pyrimidines?
Yes.

15:52.608 --> 15:56.551
C, T...

15:56.671 --> 15:57.705
And U.

15:57.825 --> 15:59.359
Amy, I was gonna get that.

15:59.396 --> 16:01.230
I'm sorry.

16:01.298 --> 16:02.198
Let's just keep going.

16:02.265 --> 16:03.533
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:03.601 --> 16:08.104
Which enzyme is responsible
for DNA replication?

16:08.171 --> 16:10.454
Agh!
I know this one.

16:10.574 --> 16:12.408
Oh, you know it.
It's...

16:13.343 --> 16:15.210
I don't know this!
What is it?

16:15.277 --> 16:17.379
It's DNA polymerase.

16:18.314 --> 16:19.681
It's okay, you got it.
You got it.

16:19.749 --> 16:21.550
I'm an idiot.
I don't know what-

16:21.618 --> 16:23.619
You're not an idiot.
This is biochemistry.

16:23.686 --> 16:26.321
It's hard.
Yeah, you think?

16:26.389 --> 16:27.823
I'm just trying to help.

16:29.358 --> 16:30.525
I don't know why I'm killing myself

16:30.592 --> 16:31.726
trying to do this stuff,

16:31.793 --> 16:32.593
when I could be making good money

16:32.661 --> 16:34.929
fixing motorcycles.

16:34.997 --> 16:37.532
Okay, you know what?

16:37.599 --> 16:39.099
Let's take a break, okay?

16:39.167 --> 16:42.102
No. I don't...
I don't need a break, Amy.

16:42.170 --> 16:44.805
I just...
I need to study, okay?

16:44.873 --> 16:46.139
Don't take this the wrong way,

16:46.206 --> 16:47.874
but this isn't really
working out, okay?

16:47.942 --> 16:49.509
Okay.

16:49.577 --> 16:50.243
I'm gonna go to the clinic
and get some studying done

16:50.310 --> 16:51.077
before my shift starts.

16:51.145 --> 16:52.111
Okay.
I'm sorry.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.880
No, it's okay.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.051
That's... straight A’s!

16:58.986 --> 17:00.854
See? I guess this school's worth
all the money

17:00.922 --> 17:02.454
if he's pulling down marks like that.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.122
Yeah, I guess so.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.290
But I wish you'd stop talking him up

17:05.358 --> 17:06.724
like he's a big genius.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.194
Well, come on, I'm proud of him.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.096
Yeah, I mean, his marks are good,

17:11.164 --> 17:13.965
but, you know,
that school's no cakewalk.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.099
You think it's easy to be a poor kid

17:15.167 --> 17:17.102
in a rich kids' school?

17:18.103 --> 17:19.971
So what're you saying?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.739
Sending a kid like Shane
to a fancy private school's

17:21.807 --> 17:23.107
a mistake.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.241
A kid like Shane?

17:24.309 --> 17:26.176
What do you mean, a kid like Shane?

17:26.243 --> 17:27.712
Well, I'm just saying...

17:27.780 --> 17:30.014
You know, a kid who's having
trouble getting along?

17:30.082 --> 17:31.783
No, he loves it there.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.217
He's just learning to cope
with a few rotten apples

17:34.285 --> 17:35.218
- "Cope."
- that bug him.

17:35.286 --> 17:37.020
So now he's just coping?

17:37.088 --> 17:38.555
No. I'm saying,
you know,

17:38.623 --> 17:41.424
there'll always be
certain kids who-

17:41.492 --> 17:44.027
What? The kid's getting
eaten alive.

17:44.095 --> 17:46.730
I mean, even with this
scholarship money,

17:46.798 --> 17:48.865
the tuition is insane.

17:48.933 --> 17:50.566
Oh, wow...

17:50.634 --> 17:52.001
It's about the money.
Isn't it?

17:52.069 --> 17:53.803
No!
I knew it!

17:53.870 --> 17:55.204
Well, yeah!
I knew it!

17:55.271 --> 17:56.305
I never should've asked you!

17:56.372 --> 17:58.975
And I didn't ask, you volunteered.

17:59.042 --> 18:00.476
I mean, nothing ever changes with you!

18:00.543 --> 18:02.912
I've changed, come on.

18:02.980 --> 18:04.814
Look at us...
We're friends,

18:04.881 --> 18:06.214
we're talking.

18:06.281 --> 18:08.416
I'm just saying, you know,
the cost of that,

18:08.484 --> 18:10.251
and the fact is
if he doesn't enjoy himself,

18:10.319 --> 18:11.820
you gotta ask yourself,
if it's worth it?

18:11.887 --> 18:13.287
Yes, it's worth it!

18:13.355 --> 18:14.956
What, what?
What are you do-

18:15.024 --> 18:16.190
Oh, come on!

18:16.258 --> 18:17.358
Let's just go for a trail ride.

18:17.426 --> 18:19.861
Damn!

18:22.030 --> 18:22.963
<i>You okay?</i>

18:23.031 --> 18:24.098
Yes, I'm okay.

18:24.165 --> 18:25.332
And I don't need favours from you,

18:25.399 --> 18:27.735
especially favours you might regret.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.737
Damn it!

18:30.772 --> 18:32.339
Let me help you!

18:32.406 --> 18:34.174
Whoa!

18:35.944 --> 18:37.077
Hang on!

18:37.145 --> 18:38.111
Hang on.
Here, I'll help you!

18:38.178 --> 18:39.178
I don't need your help!

18:39.246 --> 18:41.180
Give me your hand.

18:41.248 --> 18:43.582
What do you mean,
"Something that I might regret"?

18:47.955 --> 18:49.856
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

18:54.827 --> 18:55.827
I am fine!

18:58.998 --> 19:00.465
You're half an hour late.

19:00.533 --> 19:01.733
Sorry. I think I
sprained my pinky finger

19:01.801 --> 19:03.334
when I fell yesterday.

19:03.402 --> 19:05.270
Boo hoo! Whatever.

19:05.337 --> 19:06.337
I've been icing
it every twenty minutes

19:06.405 --> 19:07.873
but it still looks swollen.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.440
Get over it.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.342
So I think I'm
gonna kind of take it slow.

19:12.410 --> 19:13.778
Cry me a river.

19:13.845 --> 19:15.412
Georgie, that's enough.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.482
Why don't you go put up
the rest of the rails?

19:18.550 --> 19:19.750
Thank you.

19:19.818 --> 19:22.753
And you, let's get warmed up.

19:25.590 --> 19:27.356
Is everything okay with you?

19:27.424 --> 19:28.391
Yeah. Why?

19:28.458 --> 19:29.693
It's just...

19:29.760 --> 19:31.728
It seems like you might
be jealous of Georgie.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.797
Obviously not.

19:35.166 --> 19:37.734
Why does everything
come so easy for her?

19:37.802 --> 19:38.935
She's young.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.303
You have no fear when you're young.

19:40.370 --> 19:41.637
As you get older,

19:41.705 --> 19:43.238
that's when people start
to overthink things.

19:43.306 --> 19:45.373
Some people don't think at all.

19:53.183 --> 19:54.717
How's it going back there?

19:54.784 --> 19:56.018
<i>Fine.</i>

19:56.086 --> 19:58.753
<i>You know this is all your fault.</i>

19:58.821 --> 20:00.654
<i>Yeah, I know. Of course it is.</i>

20:00.723 --> 20:03.758
You know this kind of reminds me
of the last trail ride

20:03.826 --> 20:06.560
we took together in fort Saint John.

20:06.628 --> 20:09.296
<i>Yeah. I remember.
You got us lost.</i>

20:09.364 --> 20:10.431
On purpose.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.534
That was the whole plan.

20:13.602 --> 20:14.968
Get lost on purpose,

20:15.036 --> 20:17.403
so we could spend
a little more time together.

20:19.573 --> 20:20.774
Wow!

20:21.943 --> 20:23.309
My coats never looked that good on me.

20:24.946 --> 20:26.613
Was this part of a plan, too?

20:26.680 --> 20:28.982
Hey, I'm older now.

20:29.050 --> 20:31.917
I never plan that far ahead.

20:36.790 --> 20:39.358
I'm gonna pay for the schooling.

20:39.425 --> 20:40.692
If you feel it's worth it,

20:40.761 --> 20:43.362
then I'll do whatever I have to do.

20:43.429 --> 20:45.231
Okay. Thanks.

20:45.298 --> 20:47.132
You know I'll do anything for Shane.

20:47.199 --> 20:49.768
Just...

20:49.835 --> 20:52.536
It hurts me to see him struggle.

20:53.505 --> 20:54.505
Yeah, me too.

20:57.843 --> 20:59.410
You warm enough?

20:59.478 --> 21:01.979
Yeah, I'm getting there.

21:03.782 --> 21:05.149
Hey...

21:07.451 --> 21:10.220
You want a sandwich?
I got some in my pack.

21:12.123 --> 21:13.423
Okay.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.661
I'm heading over
to the Hanley place.

21:18.728 --> 21:21.563
Do you mind if we stop
calling it "the Hanley place"?

21:22.532 --> 21:23.532
Sure.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.633
Good.

21:26.469 --> 21:28.470
You know what, honey?
You know what? It's not good.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.673
Actually, it's the opposite of good.

21:30.740 --> 21:32.741
I'm pressured at work,
I'm pressured at home...

21:32.810 --> 21:34.475
And I can't...

21:34.543 --> 21:35.877
Well, it's funny 'cause I was
trying to talk to you about that

21:35.945 --> 21:37.345
but you'd rather talk to Caleb,
I guess.

21:37.413 --> 21:39.281
That is not true.
But you're never around.

21:39.348 --> 21:40.548
I mean, you don't think anything
of being away

21:40.616 --> 21:42.583
for days at a time.

21:42.651 --> 21:44.052
That's my job, Lou.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.654
Well, maybe my job is going
to New York for a month.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.722
Okay.

21:49.358 --> 21:51.591
What's going on?
So do you wanna go now?

21:51.659 --> 21:53.760
No. I'm not saying
that I w-

21:53.829 --> 21:56.030
How can I leave my baby for a month?

21:56.097 --> 21:58.565
Just tell me what you wanna do?

21:58.633 --> 21:59.934
I don't know what I want, okay?
Let's just...

22:00.001 --> 22:01.568
Can we stop talking about this?

22:01.636 --> 22:04.205
Forget it.
I'm busy.

22:04.272 --> 22:05.272
Okay.

22:07.074 --> 22:08.541
What are you working on?

22:08.608 --> 22:10.076
- Nothing. No, it's nothing.
- Let me see.

22:10.144 --> 22:11.477
Honey, go away. It's nothing.

22:11.545 --> 22:14.147
Let me see! Let me see it!
What is it?

22:15.449 --> 22:17.550
"I'm a financial analyst.

22:17.617 --> 22:19.118
<i>But I am also a mom, 24/7.</i>

22:19.186 --> 22:20.553
<i>A sleep-deprived,</i>
<i>guilt-ridden mom,</i>

22:20.620 --> 22:22.955
<i>a hot mess of a mom."</i>

22:23.022 --> 22:24.489
<i>Come on, Katie,
don't you want a big girls bed?</i>

22:25.959 --> 22:28.293
<i>Are you writing a blog?</i>

22:28.361 --> 22:30.628
I figure once I tell Martin
I can't go back to New York,

22:30.696 --> 22:33.365
I'm gonna have a lot of time
on my hands, so...

22:33.432 --> 22:35.600
Are you saying that
if you don't go to New York,

22:35.668 --> 22:38.236
you're gonna lose your job?

22:38.303 --> 22:41.005
What do you think
I've been trying to tell you?

22:45.043 --> 22:47.044
Hey.
How's this guy doing?

22:48.046 --> 22:49.580
He's good.

22:49.647 --> 22:51.749
He made it through surgery all right.

22:51.816 --> 22:53.417
I'm just keeping him comfortable.

22:53.485 --> 22:56.152
And trying to cram six months
worth of biochemistry?

22:56.220 --> 22:57.720
Yeah. I'm trying.

22:57.788 --> 22:59.856
And here I thought guys
weren't good at multi-tasking.

22:59.924 --> 23:01.091
I'm not.

23:01.158 --> 23:02.292
How did it go with the girlfriend?

23:02.360 --> 23:03.693
Was she any help?

23:03.761 --> 23:06.496
Uh, it turns out second year
biology is a killer.

23:06.563 --> 23:10.199
Potentially deadly
for even a healthy relationship.

23:10.267 --> 23:13.168
Well, I suppose I could help you.

23:13.236 --> 23:15.905
It's gonna be a long night.

23:15.972 --> 23:17.572
Are you sure?
Yeah.

23:18.508 --> 23:20.910
I could stand a little review myself.

23:20.977 --> 23:23.345
And luckily, you and me,

23:23.413 --> 23:26.547
we don't have a relationship to wreck.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.016
All right.

23:34.089 --> 23:35.023
You warm enough?

23:35.090 --> 23:36.424
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:40.396 --> 23:42.229
Here.

23:42.297 --> 23:45.632
Oh! You always had
cold feet...

23:47.802 --> 23:49.569
And cold hands.

23:55.209 --> 23:57.110
You know, I hope you don't
take this the wrong way,

23:57.178 --> 23:58.744
but I was...

23:59.712 --> 24:00.980
I was kind of glad

24:01.048 --> 24:03.849
when Shane said he didn't wanna come.

24:03.917 --> 24:05.251
Why?

24:06.852 --> 24:10.455
Because I wanted to be alone with you

24:12.258 --> 24:15.126
to see where things might go.

24:15.194 --> 24:16.261
Go?

24:17.529 --> 24:19.564
Yeah, you know....

24:21.733 --> 24:24.468
Yeah, yeah, I think I know...

24:26.972 --> 24:28.339
Because...

24:31.943 --> 24:33.077
Because why?

24:33.144 --> 24:37.714
Because I was thinking the same thing.

24:53.063 --> 24:56.465
You know, it's gonna take all night

24:56.532 --> 24:58.233
for those clothes to dry.

24:59.402 --> 25:00.469
Really.

25:03.906 --> 25:07.109
<i>The rate limiting step
in glycolysis is the enzyme</i>

25:07.176 --> 25:09.344
<i>phosphofructokinase.</i>

25:10.479 --> 25:11.778
But don't ask me how to spell that

25:11.846 --> 25:13.814
because I have no idea.

25:13.882 --> 25:16.717
<i>Well, I wasn't going to,
but now you absolutely have to.</i>

25:24.723 --> 25:25.690
Hi.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.458
Hey, Amy!

25:27.526 --> 25:30.227
Um, I just... I brought
you some turkey chili.

25:30.295 --> 25:31.728
Thank you. That's great, um...

25:31.796 --> 25:33.196
Hi, I'm Cassandra.

25:33.264 --> 25:35.098
Oh, hi. Amy.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.733
This is Amy, my girlfriend.

25:36.801 --> 25:38.434
This is Cassandra.

25:38.502 --> 25:40.971
She's a second year vet student
at UFCA.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.139
<i>I told you about her, right?</i>

25:42.206 --> 25:43.606
Right. Yeah.
Scott's new assistant,

25:43.675 --> 25:44.775
<i>right?</i>

25:45.409 --> 25:47.443
I volunteered to be his study buddy.

25:47.511 --> 25:49.212
Well, I hope you don't regret that.

25:50.747 --> 25:52.782
Who's the puppy making noise
over here, huh?

25:52.849 --> 25:53.849
Are you okay?

25:53.917 --> 25:55.251
Ah, he's a post-op.

25:55.319 --> 25:56.519
The first twenty-four hours
are pretty critical

25:56.587 --> 25:57.987
so I said I'd help Cassandra
monitor him,

25:58.055 --> 26:00.423
and get some studying done
in the meantime.

26:00.491 --> 26:01.957
That was good of you.

26:02.025 --> 26:03.758
You all right?

26:03.826 --> 26:06.728
Well, I'll let you handle it, okay?

26:06.796 --> 26:08.363
Actually, I was just about
to call you.

26:08.431 --> 26:10.065
Oh, you're busy, it's okay.

26:10.132 --> 26:11.200
Oh. Well, I'll touch base
with you later then?

26:11.267 --> 26:12.334
Yeah.
Okay.

26:12.402 --> 26:13.468
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.

26:13.536 --> 26:15.537
Bye. It was nice
meeting you.

26:15.605 --> 26:16.771
<i>Okay. Where were we?</i>

26:16.839 --> 26:17.972
<i>Phosphofructokinase.</i>

26:18.040 --> 26:19.907
<i>I'm all over that.</i>

26:19.974 --> 26:21.475
<i>Then let's draw our
attention to the lowly nucleotide.</i>

26:21.543 --> 26:23.277
<i>Which base nucleotides contain</i>
<i>the extra?</i>

26:23.345 --> 26:25.279
<i>Simple! Adenine and guanine.
What else you got?</i>

26:25.347 --> 26:27.815
Who's got the best big-girl bed
in the whole wide world?

26:27.882 --> 26:29.250
Katie does!

26:29.318 --> 26:30.751
You wanna get up here?

26:30.819 --> 26:32.320
Come on, you wanna hop up?

26:32.387 --> 26:34.655
<i>You wanna get up there,</i>
<i>Katie? Hmm?</i>

26:34.723 --> 26:35.755
<i>No?</i>

26:35.823 --> 26:37.390
I will read you a story.

26:37.458 --> 26:38.558
I will read you
two books-

26:38.626 --> 26:39.959
Hey, guys.

26:40.027 --> 26:41.361
Hey.

26:41.429 --> 26:42.329
Listen, I've been thinking
about that course

26:42.396 --> 26:44.497
your boss wants you to take.

26:44.565 --> 26:46.266
I think we can figure out a way
to make it happen.

26:46.334 --> 26:47.767
What is that supposed to mean?

26:47.835 --> 26:50.537
It means I can ask my parents
to take the baby

26:50.605 --> 26:52.003
for a little while.

26:52.071 --> 26:55.274
Right. So not only would Katie
be away from her mom,

26:55.342 --> 26:56.375
she would be away from everything

26:56.443 --> 26:57.710
she knows and loves.

26:57.777 --> 27:00.212
Or we can hire Mallory.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.980
Mallory is not always available.

27:02.048 --> 27:04.850
Well, then I can work
some more hours from home,

27:04.917 --> 27:07.685
and we can talk to Jack,
or we can ask your dad.

27:07.753 --> 27:09.754
My dad?
Are you serious?

27:09.821 --> 27:11.055
Yeah.
What I'm saying is,

27:11.123 --> 27:12.624
we can find a way to make it work.

27:12.691 --> 27:14.091
We can do it.

27:14.159 --> 27:16.461
Wow.
That was a quick switch.

27:16.528 --> 27:17.695
What's that supposed mean?

27:17.763 --> 27:19.096
No, I mean...

27:19.164 --> 27:20.565
I appreciate that you're trying
to make it work,

27:20.633 --> 27:22.933
but now I feel like
you're pushing me out the door.

27:23.001 --> 27:24.735
Well, I'm not, okay?

27:24.802 --> 27:26.202
But I just...

27:26.271 --> 27:27.537
I've been to a few
of these courses in my day,

27:27.605 --> 27:29.373
and trust me,
they can be real game-changers.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.575
I know, honey. I get that.

27:31.643 --> 27:33.176
And under different circumstances,

27:33.244 --> 27:35.845
I would jump at the chance, but...

27:35.913 --> 27:36.713
I want to get ahead, Peter,

27:36.781 --> 27:38.948
but just not at any cost.

27:39.016 --> 27:40.549
Okay.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.518
Listen, I've been in touch
with a lot of working moms,

27:42.586 --> 27:43.952
and not all of us
are on the same path.

27:44.020 --> 27:45.220
Just-just-just...

27:45.289 --> 27:46.589
I know how these things work, okay?

27:46.657 --> 27:48.457
If you don't show up,
they're gonna label you

27:48.525 --> 27:50.025
"Doesn't step up
to the plate."

27:50.093 --> 27:51.460
"Not a team player."

27:51.528 --> 27:52.728
You know, "She's taking the mommy path

27:52.796 --> 27:55.830
to career suicide."

28:10.780 --> 28:12.713
Great. What's she doing here?

28:19.587 --> 28:20.854
See, there he is, right there.

28:25.026 --> 28:26.226
I would not like
to be in an altercation

28:26.294 --> 28:27.527
<i>with that guy.</i>

28:27.594 --> 28:28.994
<i>That'd be wise.</i>

28:29.062 --> 28:31.364
<i>Probably outweighs you</i>
<i>by about 2000 pounds.</i>

28:31.432 --> 28:33.666
That is one hell of a beast.

28:33.734 --> 28:36.135
All them cows in heat,
ripe for the picking...

28:36.203 --> 28:37.970
<i>I'd say he's a pretty lucky beast.</i>

28:38.038 --> 28:39.806
As nature intended.

28:40.641 --> 28:42.174
But, you know, he seems a
lot more interested in eating

28:42.242 --> 28:45.243
than, you know, fraternizing.

28:46.278 --> 28:47.979
What do you mean?

28:48.047 --> 28:50.014
Well, I've been out here for hours.

28:50.082 --> 28:51.550
That breeding bull
seems to be doing everything

28:51.617 --> 28:53.485
<i>except breeding.</i>

28:55.421 --> 28:57.121
<i>Of course, that is just my opinion.</i>

28:57.189 --> 28:59.057
Well, I don't pay you
for your opinion, do I?

29:00.325 --> 29:02.460
Don't shoot, I'm just the messenger.

29:05.063 --> 29:07.331
If he's right,
I know who I am gonna shoot.

29:07.399 --> 29:09.400
<i>I know.</i>

29:09.468 --> 29:11.134
<i>If Tim Fleming has talked
me into buying a breeding bull</i>

29:11.202 --> 29:15.339
<i>that doesn't do</i>
<i>what he's supposed to do...</i>

29:15.406 --> 29:17.039
The bull might not be interested,

29:17.107 --> 29:19.509
but... you still are,
right?

29:21.479 --> 29:23.380
Oh, what?

29:23.447 --> 29:25.782
Just feels like
since I got back from France,

29:25.850 --> 29:29.252
you've had a certain...
I don't know...

29:29.319 --> 29:33.355
What the French would call
"froideur."

29:33.423 --> 29:35.190
The French can call it
whatever they please.

29:35.258 --> 29:38.394
But if it means what I think it does,

29:38.461 --> 29:40.829
it's all in your head.

29:44.801 --> 29:47.269
Those look awfully high.

29:47.336 --> 29:48.302
Yeah.

29:49.905 --> 29:53.541
I wonder who's been messing
with the jumps?

30:02.785 --> 30:03.817
Awesome!

30:24.037 --> 30:25.471
How was that?

30:25.539 --> 30:27.605
It was pretty fine.

30:28.707 --> 30:30.508
Here.
Let me help you.

30:30.576 --> 30:31.609
Thanks.

30:33.211 --> 30:34.278
Come here.

30:35.314 --> 30:36.314
Oh God...

30:36.381 --> 30:37.782
Tim, what if someone noticed?

30:37.850 --> 30:39.283
What if someone says something?

30:39.351 --> 30:40.384
What's the big deal?

30:40.453 --> 30:41.486
It's not like we just met.

30:41.554 --> 30:44.087
Shane is the big deal.

30:44.155 --> 30:45.622
He can't find out about this.

30:45.690 --> 30:48.391
Not until we know
it-it's real.

30:48.460 --> 30:50.961
Yeah, yeah.
You're right.

30:51.028 --> 30:52.329
You know, if anyone asks,

30:52.396 --> 30:54.396
we'll just say
we were out of cell range.

30:56.734 --> 30:57.868
Are you gonna get that?

30:57.936 --> 30:59.535
We're out of cell range.

30:59.603 --> 31:00.903
Yeah, right.

31:01.872 --> 31:02.939
Agh! It's just Jack.

31:03.006 --> 31:05.975
Whatever he wants can wait.

31:10.313 --> 31:11.948
Good boy.

31:12.015 --> 31:13.048
Good boy.

31:35.904 --> 31:37.238
Nice!
Way to stick with it!

31:40.575 --> 31:41.775
Yes, good boy!

31:44.579 --> 31:45.779
Yes! Good boy!

31:52.653 --> 31:53.753
Tim!

31:53.821 --> 31:55.822
Okay, okay. Gee!

31:55.890 --> 31:57.857
What, you don't answer your phone?

31:57.925 --> 31:58.925
What?
You tried to call me?

31:58.993 --> 32:00.760
A number of times, yeah.

32:00.828 --> 32:03.362
Well, you know,
I don't get reception out here.

32:03.430 --> 32:06.232
Yeah. We both know that
that's a load of bull.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.367
Speaking of which...

32:08.435 --> 32:10.869
What?
Something wrong?

32:10.937 --> 32:14.573
Our bull, Ladies Man?
I don't think so.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.008
What do you mean?

32:16.076 --> 32:17.843
Well, just that he seems
to prefer other activities,

32:17.911 --> 32:19.277
like eating...
and sleeping.

32:19.345 --> 32:20.611
Jack, I told you,

32:20.679 --> 32:22.280
the guy I bought him from
said he's good to go.

32:22.348 --> 32:23.948
What he said doesn't interest me.

32:24.016 --> 32:25.483
You know what I want?

32:25.551 --> 32:27.318
I wanna see a piece of paper
with the test results.

32:27.386 --> 32:28.953
Just dial it down a notch.

32:29.021 --> 32:31.756
Well, then show me the paper.
I'm happy to be on my way.

32:31.823 --> 32:35.259
Okay! I don't have
a paper.

32:37.595 --> 32:39.729
Seriously, what are the odds?

32:39.797 --> 32:41.231
Ty says they're like one percent.

32:41.299 --> 32:42.766
Ty says.

32:42.833 --> 32:44.034
Well, Ty isn't a vet.

32:44.102 --> 32:46.036
He's a second year science student.

32:46.104 --> 32:47.871
You know, only an idiot
would buy a bull

32:47.939 --> 32:49.173
without having him tested.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.941
Fine.
I take responsibility...

32:52.008 --> 32:54.143
Yeah, well, that is a first.

32:54.211 --> 32:56.011
But only for half an idiot,

32:56.080 --> 32:57.213
'cause you own the other half.

33:05.189 --> 33:08.156
Okay, okay. Go on...

33:13.329 --> 33:14.729
You know, when I left
the clinic this morning,

33:14.797 --> 33:16.998
I found some turkey chili
on the front steps.

33:17.066 --> 33:19.367
Must have been cold by then.

33:20.303 --> 33:22.670
It was still good.
I ate it all.

33:22.738 --> 33:24.338
Of course you did.

33:25.307 --> 33:27.741
You know, I'm really glad

33:27.809 --> 33:29.009
that you have someone like Cassandra

33:29.077 --> 33:32.012
that can help you out.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.047
I don't wanna hurt
your chances in any way.

33:34.116 --> 33:37.451
And I just...

33:37.519 --> 33:40.487
There was a moment there
when I saw you guys together.

33:40.554 --> 33:42.021
We're not together.

33:42.089 --> 33:43.423
I know. We just work in the same place.

33:43.491 --> 33:44.857
I know.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.260
And there's going to be
stuff in your life

33:47.328 --> 33:49.562
that I'm not part of,

33:49.630 --> 33:51.331
and I'm okay with that.

33:54.335 --> 33:55.734
Hey, you...

33:56.669 --> 33:57.836
Phoenix, good boy.

33:58.804 --> 33:59.804
Hey.

34:01.774 --> 34:04.009
Hey, I am not okay with this.

34:05.011 --> 34:07.078
Someone's been riding him

34:07.147 --> 34:08.079
I think I have a pretty good idea

34:08.148 --> 34:10.349
who that someone is.

34:15.146 --> 34:16.847
<i>What are we gonna
wear, kitty cat? Hmm?</i>

34:16.915 --> 34:18.348
<i>What do you think?</i>

34:18.416 --> 34:20.717
Okay, what kind of day
is it gonna be, honey? Hmm?

34:20.786 --> 34:24.889
Is it gonna be a cute skirt
and onesie kind of a day?

34:24.956 --> 34:26.690
Or is it gonna be a more
t-shirt and shorts

34:26.757 --> 34:28.292
casual kind of day?

34:28.359 --> 34:30.127
What about you there, mom?
Shouldn't you be packing too?

34:30.228 --> 34:31.562
Oh, whatever.
I'll just.

34:31.629 --> 34:32.696
Throw a few things in a bag

34:32.763 --> 34:34.630
at the last minute.

34:34.699 --> 34:35.831
Oh, you want this one?
There you go.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.667
For a month in New York?

34:37.735 --> 34:39.735
<i>That doesn't sound like you.</i>

34:39.804 --> 34:41.605
Huh? What's up?

34:41.672 --> 34:44.174
Well, I get that maybe you guys
are okay with me leaving,

34:44.242 --> 34:45.741
but what if I'm not okay

34:45.809 --> 34:48.444
being away from my family for a month?

34:48.512 --> 34:50.012
Right?

34:50.414 --> 34:53.149
Yeah, I go through that
every time I get on a plane.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.783
<i>Yeah, but you still do it.</i>

34:55.752 --> 34:57.052
You know what I do?

34:57.121 --> 34:58.887
Actually, I play a little game
with myself.

34:58.955 --> 35:00.756
If I'm going for a week,

35:00.824 --> 35:03.057
I tell myself it's just for a day.

35:03.126 --> 35:05.260
If that day goes okay,
I stay another day.

35:07.896 --> 35:10.499
What if I can't make it
past the first day?

35:10.566 --> 35:14.669
Then we'll put you on
the next flight home.

35:27.782 --> 35:30.083
Well, so much for your theory.

35:30.152 --> 35:31.485
I don't see her anywhere.

35:34.288 --> 35:35.321
Look

35:42.630 --> 35:44.063
come on, let's go.

36:17.127 --> 36:18.195
She is amazing.

36:22.766 --> 36:24.601
<i>I did not give her
permission to ride that horse,</i>

36:24.669 --> 36:25.835
let alone jump it.

36:39.382 --> 36:40.949
Yeah. You should
probably do something.

36:41.017 --> 36:42.685
I'm going to.

36:44.786 --> 36:45.886
<i>I haven't seen anything like that</i>

36:45.954 --> 36:48.590
since I first saw you and Spartan.

36:48.657 --> 36:50.325
That girl has absolutely no fear.

36:54.463 --> 36:56.864
She's gonna be afraid.

36:56.932 --> 36:57.965
Very afraid.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.401
<i>Hey, Jack!</i>

37:05.173 --> 37:06.340
I'm not interested.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.877
Just...

37:09.945 --> 37:14.248
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about the bull

37:14.315 --> 37:17.183
and that I'm gonna try
to make it up to you...

37:17.251 --> 37:19.152
But I wanted to ask you a favour.

37:19.220 --> 37:20.353
I'm not surprised.

37:20.420 --> 37:22.521
It's, it's about Miranda.

37:23.457 --> 37:28.461
There could be something
and there could be nothing.

37:28.528 --> 37:30.696
I just wondered if you could
keep it under your hat?

37:30.765 --> 37:32.197
I don't want the kids to find out.

37:32.265 --> 37:36.001
Well, I don't know
what I'd say anyhow, so...

37:36.870 --> 37:40.305
<i>They say a picture is
worth a thousand words.</i>

37:40.373 --> 37:41.840
<i>Isn't that it?</i>

37:42.575 --> 37:44.977
You hated every minute
of that trip to France, Jack.

37:45.044 --> 37:46.145
No, I didn't.

37:46.212 --> 37:49.947
I hated being away from home,
that's...

37:50.015 --> 37:53.284
But Lisa thinks I loved it, so...

37:53.351 --> 37:54.551
I have to tell her how I really feel

37:54.619 --> 37:56.087
one of these days.

37:56.155 --> 37:57.822
No.

37:59.792 --> 38:02.693
Just tell her what's important.

38:02.761 --> 38:05.461
Tell her you love her.

38:05.529 --> 38:07.463
It was just a trip.

38:07.531 --> 38:09.766
Don't rock the boat.

38:27.984 --> 38:29.051
Agh!

38:34.191 --> 38:35.257
Mallory!

38:35.325 --> 38:36.691
Hey, I'm sorry I was late.

38:36.758 --> 38:38.626
Funny that.
I was right on time.

38:38.694 --> 38:40.328
I had a problem with Georgie.

38:40.395 --> 38:42.563
Yeah.
It's all about Georgie.

38:42.631 --> 38:43.865
You told me you weren't jealous.

38:43.933 --> 38:46.334
Maybe I am -
how disturbing is that?

38:46.401 --> 38:47.702
Okay, wait.

38:47.769 --> 38:49.003
You can't leave like this.

38:49.071 --> 38:50.438
You were doing so well yesterday.

38:50.505 --> 38:52.572
Just talk to me.
You've changed...

38:52.640 --> 38:54.474
Yeah.
Try moving to Nashville,

38:54.542 --> 38:55.909
that'll change you.

38:55.977 --> 38:58.178
I was just some boring
new kid from Canada.

38:58.246 --> 38:59.512
My dad wasn't even famous.

38:59.580 --> 39:01.681
In Nashville, Charlie Wells
is just a small fish

39:01.749 --> 39:03.016
in a big pond.

39:03.084 --> 39:05.886
I didn't even make any new friends.

39:05.954 --> 39:08.221
I'm sorry.
But you're back now,

39:08.288 --> 39:09.889
and next year is your senior year,

39:09.957 --> 39:10.857
and you're gonna rule the school

39:10.924 --> 39:12.124
with all your old friends.

39:12.192 --> 39:14.593
Yeah. Except I don't have
any friends here.

39:14.661 --> 39:16.896
Jake is the only person
who even cares that I'm back.

39:16.964 --> 39:17.964
I'm sorry.

39:18.031 --> 39:19.098
I was just hoping that I could

39:19.166 --> 39:20.333
ride in some horse shows

39:20.400 --> 39:21.901
and make some new friends.

39:21.969 --> 39:24.169
But, of course,
I'm even too useless to do that.

39:24.237 --> 39:25.937
You're not useless, all right?

39:26.005 --> 39:27.839
Please, don't lie to me, Amy, not you.

39:27.907 --> 39:28.940
I wouldn't.

39:29.008 --> 39:30.375
Look, if we keep at it,

39:30.442 --> 39:31.576
you're not only gonna be
riding in horse shows,

39:31.643 --> 39:32.677
you're gonna be winning in them.

39:32.745 --> 39:33.845
I don't care about winning.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.513
I just don't need some annoying brat

39:35.581 --> 39:36.481
showing me up!

39:36.548 --> 39:37.883
Hey, it's not like that.

39:37.950 --> 39:39.117
Honestly, Amy,

39:39.185 --> 39:41.051
this has been
the worst year of my life,

39:41.119 --> 39:42.552
and I come back home

39:42.620 --> 39:44.821
and things have not gotten better.

39:44.890 --> 39:47.892
It's gonna get better, okay?

39:47.959 --> 39:51.929
And you're not gonna quit
'cause I'm not letting you.

39:59.554 --> 40:00.454
<i>Yoo-hooo!</i>

40:00.521 --> 40:02.821
Yeah. Come on in!

40:02.889 --> 40:04.022
I have good news for you.

40:04.091 --> 40:05.191
Uh-huh.

40:05.258 --> 40:06.692
Yes, I talked to Lanny Barrick

40:06.759 --> 40:08.961
and he has agreed to buy
that big buffalo off of you.

40:09.028 --> 40:10.296
Oh, now, hold on.

40:10.363 --> 40:13.665
That buffalo might not be
much of a ladies man,

40:13.733 --> 40:16.001
but that doesn't mean
I'm just giving him away.

40:16.069 --> 40:17.402
No one said you had to give him away.

40:17.470 --> 40:20.305
He's offered to pay
half the purchase price.

40:20.372 --> 40:22.273
Well, I only paid half,

40:22.341 --> 40:25.710
so I guess that means
Tim gets nothing! Ha!

40:25.777 --> 40:28.846
Though Lanny does know
that the stud's a dud?

40:28.914 --> 40:31.116
I don't think he cares
'cause he just wants it

40:31.183 --> 40:34.050
as a landscape element
for his dream ranch.

40:34.119 --> 40:35.885
That's good then.
You want some coffee?

40:35.953 --> 40:37.588
Hey, what's up with that?

40:38.656 --> 40:41.291
Hmm...
First I noticed.

40:42.627 --> 40:45.362
You know, Lisa, all those pictures,

40:45.430 --> 40:48.064
you see the same ones
over and over and...

40:48.133 --> 40:49.532
I know.
But you know what?

40:49.600 --> 40:52.535
Every time we go to France,
we're gonna add new ones.

40:52.603 --> 40:53.636
Look...

40:59.443 --> 41:01.043
Okay, you make
sure you call me, huh?

41:01.111 --> 41:02.978
Yeah. I will.

41:05.181 --> 41:08.883
Make sure that son
of ours calls me too.

41:13.222 --> 41:15.524
Oh, Tim, what have we done?

41:15.591 --> 41:17.492
I don't know.

41:18.861 --> 41:20.562
Neither do I.

41:21.563 --> 41:22.963
Yeah, well...

41:23.031 --> 41:24.064
We'll figure it out.

41:28.736 --> 41:29.836
Yeah.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.344
♪ Remember when ♪

41:38.412 --> 41:42.114
♪ we were scared to lose our skin ♪

41:43.083 --> 41:45.818
♪ and I just found out ♪

41:46.820 --> 41:48.454
♪ what I always knew ♪

41:48.522 --> 41:50.723
Honey, you gotta go.
You're gonna miss your flight.

41:50.791 --> 41:54.393
Look at her in her bed.
It's a miracle.

41:59.798 --> 42:01.699
How can I leave my baby?

42:02.934 --> 42:04.635
It's only for today.

42:12.143 --> 42:13.377
Here you go.

42:14.413 --> 42:16.279
Oh, ah, thank you, Amy.

42:16.380 --> 42:18.481
This looks great, but um...

42:18.549 --> 42:20.983
You know, I'm just not hungry
right now.

42:21.051 --> 42:22.852
Ty, come on.

42:22.920 --> 42:24.554
You know,
maybe I can't help you study,

42:24.622 --> 42:25.655
but I can make sure
that you've got something

42:25.723 --> 42:28.291
in your stomach for your exams.

42:28.359 --> 42:30.827
Honestly, Amy,
I-I can't.

42:32.095 --> 42:33.095
Thank you.

42:34.364 --> 42:35.698
You sure you're okay?

42:35.765 --> 42:37.499
You're not nervous, are you?

42:37.567 --> 42:42.204
No. I think I know
my stuff, and uh...

42:42.272 --> 42:44.440
I feel confident,

42:44.507 --> 42:45.574
well-prepared.

42:45.642 --> 42:46.875
- Good.
- Yeah.

42:47.843 --> 42:49.210
All right, well, good luck.

42:49.278 --> 42:52.046
Not that you're gonna need it
or anything.

42:52.114 --> 42:53.147
