00:44.588 --> 00:46.022
A traveler,

00:46.024 --> 00:48.323
storm-stained
and brown,

00:48.325 --> 00:51.393
from farthest desert
touched the town.

00:51.395 --> 00:53.328
And striding through the town,

00:53.330 --> 00:57.500
held up above his head
a jeweled cup.

00:57.502 --> 01:00.369
He put two fingers
to his lip

01:00.371 --> 01:04.208
and whispered wild,
he stood a-tip.

01:04.209 --> 01:07.777
And leaned the while
with lifted hand, and said,

01:07.779 --> 01:10.313
"A ship lies yonder dead.

01:10.315 --> 01:14.250
Gold dust sown in sand
along your desert,

01:14.252 --> 01:15.955
dead and brown."

02:17.885 --> 02:20.289
Yeah, I got it.
But hurry.

03:03.366 --> 03:05.735
- No wound!
- Heart attack.

03:09.639 --> 03:11.342
It's cursed.

03:21.585 --> 03:23.554
Before he does.

04:54.949 --> 04:56.015
Listen to this.

04:56.017 --> 04:57.783
"'Lost ship of the desert'
stories first appeared

04:57.785 --> 05:01.321
"after the Colorado River flood
of 1862.

05:01.323 --> 05:04.490
"Eyewitnesses reported
a half-buried hulk

05:04.492 --> 05:07.060
- in an alkali marsh."
- What's an alkali marsh?

05:07.062 --> 05:09.062
"Expeditions were sent out
from Yuma,

05:09.064 --> 05:11.431
"but by the time they arrived,
the ship had disappeared

05:11.433 --> 05:13.769
under the shifting sand
and mud."

05:14.269 --> 05:15.904
What's an alkali marsh?

05:16.472 --> 05:18.040
It's like a...

05:18.640 --> 05:20.542
a dry salt lake.

05:21.010 --> 05:21.910
I think.

05:22.978 --> 05:24.278
"Some accounts match
descriptions

05:24.280 --> 05:28.451
of the legendary lost treasure
ship of King Solomon's navy."

05:28.917 --> 05:29.852
Wow.

05:31.321 --> 05:33.857
Hey, Fink, would you rather be
a smart pig or a dumb dolphin?

05:36.558 --> 05:37.591
Dolphin.

05:37.593 --> 05:39.262
You're a super smart pig,
though.

05:39.528 --> 05:42.032
You could work with computers
if you wanted.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.701
No. Dolphin.

05:45.568 --> 05:46.903
Winters and Wang.

05:47.537 --> 05:49.003
They're not going to beat us
to this one.

05:49.005 --> 05:51.708
Don't you think, Fink? I don't
think they're going to beat us.

05:52.876 --> 05:53.944
More north, Moses.
You're drifting.

05:54.878 --> 05:56.577
Smart pig can drive a car.

05:56.579 --> 05:58.679
He can use the bathroom
and a cell phone.

05:58.681 --> 06:00.751
The dolphin is the dumbest
in the entire herd.

06:02.119 --> 06:03.585
Yeah, I don't care.
I want to be the dolphin.

06:03.587 --> 06:05.888
But everyone makes fun of you
because you're so stupid.

06:05.890 --> 06:08.325
Are you sure
you want that, Fink?

06:09.794 --> 06:12.497
Winters and Wang may have found
every treasure of the southwest,

06:13.831 --> 06:15.300
but they do not find
the lost ship of the desert.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.970
Guess who beats them to it?
Fink and Moses, that's who.

06:19.971 --> 06:22.841
Gold bars in the sand,
jeweled cups, black pearls.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.109
Bags of gold dust.

06:25.444 --> 06:26.211
How many bags of gold dust
did you say, Fink?

06:27.646 --> 06:30.450
On Solomon's ship, 25,000.
Supposedly a pound each.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.618
Twenty-five thousand
bags of pure gold dust?

06:34.152 --> 06:34.920
That's... that's...

06:36.154 --> 06:37.923
Six hundred million dollars.
Give or take.

06:38.657 --> 06:40.093
Moses, pay attention.

06:41.294 --> 06:42.195
Hit it on top.

06:42.929 --> 06:44.197
Hit the horn on top.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.134
Smart pig speaks
at conferences,

06:49.168 --> 06:49.836
knows how to impress
the ladies.

06:50.736 --> 06:51.602
Knows all about
food and wine.

06:51.604 --> 06:53.304
- He's a great writer...
- Hey, hey.

06:53.306 --> 06:54.774
- What?
- Stop, stop, stop.

06:55.241 --> 06:56.275
What?

06:57.377 --> 06:59.178
That draw between
those hills.

06:59.979 --> 07:01.448
- Copper ridge?
- Nope.

07:02.516 --> 07:03.749
- The silver king.
- No, no.

07:04.485 --> 07:06.686
Lost blue bucket placer.

07:07.287 --> 07:08.688
Lost Dutch oven.

07:12.025 --> 07:14.292
The pig is so smart, he could...

07:14.294 --> 07:15.496
But he's a pig!

07:16.598 --> 07:17.329
Were you not listening to me?

07:17.331 --> 07:18.632
I already told you,

07:19.700 --> 07:20.368
he's the smartest pig
in all the land.

07:21.302 --> 07:22.470
But he's a pig, Moses.

07:23.538 --> 07:25.573
I... I hate this game.
It's so dumb.

07:26.508 --> 07:27.609
Why would you say that?

07:28.476 --> 07:29.477
You didn't have to say that.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.216
What's it say, Fink?

07:36.518 --> 07:38.253
It says, "Wide draw,
three-hour walk,"

07:39.154 --> 07:40.288
But from where,
I don't know.

07:41.322 --> 07:42.223
Fink. Tent stakes.

07:43.024 --> 07:43.691
Okay, hang on.

07:44.826 --> 07:46.027
It talks about
an abandoned camp.

07:47.128 --> 07:48.161
Buckets and blankets
and utensils.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.429
It's...

07:49.431 --> 07:50.432
A spoon!

07:51.333 --> 07:52.665
Okay, there ought to be

07:52.667 --> 07:54.769
an 80-foot shaft
somewhere around here.

07:56.906 --> 07:58.040
Fink...

08:04.980 --> 08:06.115
...we're right on top of it.

08:08.317 --> 08:10.786
Maybe for once...

08:11.521 --> 08:12.520
The lost Dutch oven!

08:12.522 --> 08:13.789
We did it. We did it.

08:14.524 --> 08:16.293
We beat them. Open it.

08:17.394 --> 08:18.461
No, you found it.
You should do it.

08:50.494 --> 08:53.731
Winters and Wang, they always
seem to be one step ahead of us.

08:55.099 --> 08:56.767
Why can't we get there
just once before they did?

08:58.202 --> 09:01.671
Hey, Fink, if we found it,
the lost ship millions,

09:01.673 --> 09:02.873
what would you do with it?

09:04.142 --> 09:06.211
One thing, besides marrying
Jody Fairshanks.

09:07.346 --> 09:09.181
Okay, you do that on purpose,
don't you?

09:09.915 --> 09:11.718
It's Joy Lynn Fairbanks.

09:13.252 --> 09:14.286
That's what I would do.

09:15.053 --> 09:15.785
That's what I would
always do.

09:15.787 --> 09:16.955
That was high school, Fink.

09:18.023 --> 09:19.291
She probably got married
a long time ago.

09:20.025 --> 09:20.892
She might have waited.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.061
Do you even know
where she lives?

09:23.862 --> 09:24.729
- Yes, I do.
- You know that how?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.266
Because last time
we were in town,

09:27.133 --> 09:28.466
I looked her up on the...

09:28.468 --> 09:29.936
on the Inter...
cloud thing.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.403
- That's not what it's called.
- Yes.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.673
And I got her address,
which is outside of Las Vegas,

09:34.807 --> 09:36.376
which probably isn't
that far away from here.

09:37.777 --> 09:38.878
Well, that's fantastic, Fink.
What are you waiting for?

09:39.613 --> 09:41.312
Well, she always said

09:41.314 --> 09:45.586
she would only marry a very
successful, rich guy, so...

09:46.185 --> 09:47.084
Hmm. Sorry.

09:47.086 --> 09:47.954
Yeah.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.223
What would you do, Moses?

09:51.225 --> 09:52.892
If we found it,
what would you do?

09:54.061 --> 09:54.993
I'd either become
a big movie star,

09:54.995 --> 09:56.297
or I'd start an orphanage.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.566
I don't think you can just
pay a lot of money

10:00.434 --> 10:01.268
and become a big
movie star.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.402
False. How do you think
they get their parts?

10:03.404 --> 10:04.371
I'll tell you how.

10:05.507 --> 10:06.675
They hire agents
who negotiate fees.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.909
The more money you pay,
the better the role.

10:10.312 --> 10:11.277
Yeah, but if they're always
paying for their roles,

10:11.279 --> 10:12.480
how come they're
so rich?

10:13.814 --> 10:15.417
They're movie stars.
Movie stars are always rich.

10:16.751 --> 10:17.719
You know, this will probably
really impress you.

10:19.087 --> 10:20.088
I happen to know quite a bit
about the movie world.

10:20.522 --> 10:21.389
Okay, hold still.

10:22.357 --> 10:23.491
I was in
The Lord of the Rings.

10:25.728 --> 10:27.663
You were in
The Lord of the Rings?

10:29.064 --> 10:30.832
The first one, in the '70s,
before you and I came out here.

10:31.701 --> 10:33.402
In The Lord of the Rings.

10:34.670 --> 10:36.605
Yeah. I had a small part.
I got fired.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.741
Had one line. I was an Orc.

10:40.076 --> 10:41.310
You were an Orc
in The Lord of the Rings?

10:42.545 --> 10:43.711
Yeah, but I couldn't
get the line right.

10:43.713 --> 10:45.112
There was so much
to remember.

10:45.114 --> 10:46.615
There's a lot of people
on the set,

10:47.718 --> 10:48.551
people moving around
everywhere.

10:51.020 --> 10:51.921
Okay, I'll show you.
Talk like the director.

10:53.222 --> 10:54.321
- Stop moving.
- Wrong. He says, "move."

10:54.323 --> 10:55.726
Actually,
the word's "action."

10:56.859 --> 10:58.094
First they say,
"Quiet on the set."

10:59.463 --> 11:01.997
And then they say,
"roll sound, roll camera.

11:02.432 --> 11:03.100
Action."

11:04.301 --> 11:05.469
So go ahead and say it.

11:06.636 --> 11:07.704
- Say what? "Action"?
- Say all the words.

11:08.305 --> 11:09.940
Oh, my... okay.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.744
Quiet on the set.
Roll sound.

11:13.611 --> 11:15.379
Roll camera. Roll action.

11:17.347 --> 11:19.116
Fear, for the city
is ripe with it.

11:21.184 --> 11:22.687
The city is what?

11:23.887 --> 11:25.055
Ripe.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.326
I don't think
that's right.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.396
It might have been "rife."

11:31.896 --> 11:32.561
But not "ripe."

11:32.563 --> 11:33.731
- Not ripe.
- No.

11:34.665 --> 11:36.234
Or maybe "rank."
But not "ripe."

11:37.568 --> 11:38.469
Okay, let me try it again.
Say all the words.

11:39.571 --> 11:40.570
No, I'm not going
to say that,

11:40.572 --> 11:41.272
because they're all
still rolling.

11:42.474 --> 11:45.076
Fear, for the city
is rife with it.

11:46.144 --> 11:47.677
- Okay, stop.
- What?

11:47.679 --> 11:50.449
I think it would just be,
"the city is rife with it."

11:51.784 --> 11:53.049
You don't have to say
"for the city is rife with it."

11:53.051 --> 11:54.117
That doesn't make sense.

11:54.119 --> 11:55.421
- Not "for"?
- No.

11:56.722 --> 11:57.689
- Okay, let me try again.
- That's fine.

11:59.726 --> 12:01.659
Fear... sorry, sorry.

12:01.661 --> 12:03.830
They're still rolling.
It's okay.

12:04.864 --> 12:07.266
Fear.... can we take it back?

12:07.933 --> 12:09.032
Moses, do you need
a minute.

12:09.034 --> 12:10.904
Yes. No, no,
I'll get it this time.

12:11.271 --> 12:12.004
Okay, fine.

12:12.739 --> 12:13.939
Quiet on the set.

12:14.707 --> 12:16.075
Roll sound.

12:16.843 --> 12:17.877
Roll camera.

12:18.978 --> 12:20.447
Fear, for the city
is with it.

12:21.047 --> 12:22.215
Okay, cut.

12:23.149 --> 12:24.217
- What?
- They weren't rolling.

12:25.985 --> 12:26.687
Can we do it again?

12:27.755 --> 12:29.222
We can, but everyone's
getting tired.

12:29.790 --> 12:30.458
Sorry, sorry.

12:31.492 --> 12:32.758
- Quiet on the set!
- No, no.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.160
You said I was the director.

12:35.362 --> 12:36.230
You don't say anything
until I say "action."

12:36.963 --> 12:37.698
You say "action." I see.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.935
That's right.
So, are you ready?

12:41.902 --> 12:43.537
- Yes.
- Quiet on the set.

12:44.271 --> 12:46.574
Roll sound. Roll camera

12:47.274 --> 12:48.042
- Action.
- Cut!

12:49.276 --> 12:51.178
No, no, you don't say "cut."
I say "cut."

12:52.079 --> 12:52.978
You say action, and I say...

12:52.980 --> 12:55.750
You say your line only.

12:56.651 --> 12:57.953
Wasn't there a backup Orc?

12:58.720 --> 12:59.619
I am the backup Orc.

12:59.621 --> 13:01.356
Okay, that makes...
you know what?

13:02.357 --> 13:03.023
Then we're doing this
once more.

13:04.125 --> 13:05.193
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:06.027 --> 13:07.395
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

13:08.497 --> 13:11.066
Quiet on the set.
Roll sound. Roll camera.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.367
Roll action.

13:13.669 --> 13:16.873
Fear that young money city
is rank with it.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.441
What does that
even mean?

13:20.443 --> 13:21.744
I thought I should
ad lib.

13:23.011 --> 13:23.679
No, you shouldn't ad lib.
You shouldn't.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.079
You should say your one
stupid line.

13:26.081 --> 13:27.381
Okay, let me go
one more time.

13:27.383 --> 13:28.184
No.

13:29.218 --> 13:30.386
- Roll sound.
- No.

13:31.554 --> 13:32.486
- Roll camera.
- No, those aren't your lines.

13:32.488 --> 13:33.389
- Action.
- No.

13:34.423 --> 13:36.557
Fear for that fresh
money city

13:36.559 --> 13:37.828
is ripe and delicious.

13:38.561 --> 13:41.397
Oh, so delicious.

13:47.237 --> 13:49.306
How do I look?

13:49.907 --> 13:51.375
You look good.

13:52.509 --> 13:54.276
But Moses, listen,
if I were you,

13:54.278 --> 13:57.714
I would definitely, definitely
stick with the orphanage idea.

13:59.216 --> 14:00.617
I agree.

14:05.657 --> 14:07.291
Fear.

15:09.155 --> 15:11.890
I've been calling for, like,
one minute, 48 seconds.

15:11.892 --> 15:13.360
Would you turn that down.

15:13.828 --> 15:14.695
Jesus!

15:16.097 --> 15:17.261
So Santa hasn't made it

15:17.263 --> 15:20.401
to the north pole,
Machuca has disappeared,

15:21.602 --> 15:22.768
and not reported in
with my pixie dust.

15:22.770 --> 15:23.869
And this was no small load,
baby.

15:23.871 --> 15:25.940
I'm talking
it was like Christmas.

15:26.674 --> 15:29.077
The sleigh was loaded.

15:30.177 --> 15:31.379
Mm!

15:33.815 --> 15:35.683
That is a snooze, baby.

15:36.384 --> 15:38.552
So, start with Machuca.

15:39.655 --> 15:41.523
No. Take him with you.

15:42.256 --> 15:43.257
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:44.191 --> 15:46.092
Don't you start.
Don't you start.

15:46.094 --> 15:47.362
I'm not looking at you.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.863
I'm really not going
to look at you, okay?

15:49.865 --> 15:51.065
I'm not going to look at you.

15:51.067 --> 15:53.266
Do him later. Do him later.

15:53.268 --> 15:55.038
I got to take this call.

17:11.449 --> 17:14.017
Moses, listen... "1933,

17:14.019 --> 17:16.454
"Los Angeles librarian
Myrtle Botts

17:17.857 --> 17:19.892
claims to have seen photos
taken by an old prospector..."

17:20.492 --> 17:21.425
Hey, like us.

17:21.426 --> 17:23.061
"...of a serpent-necked vessel.

17:23.929 --> 17:24.930
"Vikings, or Moroccan pirates,

17:26.233 --> 17:27.867
"sailing through a pre-desert
gulf of California.

17:29.002 --> 17:30.036
"Photos were never
authenticated,

17:30.904 --> 17:32.269
but the reports were the same."

17:32.271 --> 17:35.041
Vast amounts of gold dust,
a dry salt lake.

17:36.275 --> 17:37.309
It has to be the same ship.
It has to be.

17:38.678 --> 17:41.447
Hey, would you rather be
a loved toothless wrestler,

17:42.449 --> 17:43.349
or a hated hockey player
with teeth?

17:44.217 --> 17:45.550
We're not doing this today.

17:45.552 --> 17:47.754
And you're drifting south.
We want east.

17:48.355 --> 17:50.056
How come?

17:51.225 --> 17:53.293
Because east is where we think
the ship is.

17:54.162 --> 17:55.393
No, how come
you don't choose

17:55.395 --> 17:56.663
between the wrestler
or the hockey player?

17:57.764 --> 17:59.533
Come on.
No, no, I don't want to play.

18:00.467 --> 18:01.267
- Come on.
- No.

18:01.269 --> 18:02.601
And hold that course,

18:02.603 --> 18:04.272
or I'm going to have to drive.

18:05.139 --> 18:06.741
Loved toothless wrestler,

18:07.775 --> 18:09.108
or hated hockey player
with teeth?

18:09.110 --> 18:12.214
I'd be the hated hockey player
with teeth, okay?

18:13.614 --> 18:16.751
But I would use my teeth
to smile and become loved.

18:17.618 --> 18:18.419
Cheating. You can't do that.

18:19.021 --> 18:20.655
Whoa! Look.

18:21.123 --> 18:22.157
What?

18:27.461 --> 18:29.231
Hey, wait a minute.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.036
That's not on any
of our maps.

18:50.385 --> 18:52.055
Moses, it's salt.

18:52.655 --> 18:53.556
Is this it?

18:54.724 --> 18:55.823
I think this is it.
You think this is it?

18:55.825 --> 18:56.926
This is it, Fink.

19:20.017 --> 19:21.051
Fink!

19:21.652 --> 19:23.053
Get the truck!

19:31.729 --> 19:33.397
What is that?

19:43.074 --> 19:44.976
See it against the rocks?

19:45.877 --> 19:46.711
- What is it?
- I don't know.

19:50.515 --> 19:51.883
Right over there.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.541
Oh, it's somebody.

20:17.576 --> 20:19.413
I got nothing.

20:24.084 --> 20:24.885
Moses.

20:26.820 --> 20:28.188
It's heavy.

20:30.390 --> 20:31.392
What?

20:33.294 --> 20:34.461
What is it?

20:41.235 --> 20:42.403
We should leave it.

20:43.871 --> 20:45.237
No. No, we're not
leaving it.

20:45.239 --> 20:46.506
Then we should
get out of here.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.044
Come on, Fink.

21:14.236 --> 21:15.402
Let him talk. Let him talk.

21:17.439 --> 21:19.208
Where's my money,
Machuca?

21:20.377 --> 21:22.578
You got my pixie dust,
so where's my money?

21:23.446 --> 21:24.945
Oh, and where's my lost boy?

21:24.947 --> 21:27.850
I swear, I swear I left
the money, same as always.

21:28.951 --> 21:31.585
He was dead
when I got there.

21:31.587 --> 21:32.654
Who's dead?

21:33.522 --> 21:34.758
Santa.

21:36.026 --> 21:36.893
Santa's dead?

21:37.994 --> 21:39.029
I told him to no drink
so much tequila.

21:39.396 --> 21:40.196
I told him...

21:41.164 --> 21:42.599
You killed Santa Claus,
Machuca?

21:43.800 --> 21:46.002
Ask the lost boy.
The lost boy knows.

21:46.736 --> 21:47.438
Ask the lost boy.

21:48.339 --> 21:51.275
Okay, let's ask him, huh?

21:52.642 --> 21:54.542
Santa always takes the lost boy
and the flying machine.

21:54.544 --> 21:55.812
I take the dust,

21:56.881 --> 21:57.680
and I leave the money
in the jeep.

21:58.615 --> 21:59.917
- I swear...
- Answer, boy.

22:01.385 --> 22:04.155
He walked hundreds of thousands
of miles into town, Machuca?

22:04.989 --> 22:06.388
I...I don't know. Maybe.

22:06.390 --> 22:08.726
And I'm supposed to believe
this, Machuca, yeah?

22:09.827 --> 22:12.397
That was not my job!

22:13.198 --> 22:14.765
That's not my job.

22:15.699 --> 22:18.303
Because I do, Machuca.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.539
I do believe you.

22:21.639 --> 22:23.508
And that bothers me, Machuca.
You see?

22:24.109 --> 22:24.876
You know why?

22:25.944 --> 22:27.277
Because I don't believe
anyone, Machuca.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.278
I don't believe anyone.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.147
No.

22:29.748 --> 22:31.716
So, for you,

22:32.518 --> 22:34.653
making me believe you...

22:36.422 --> 22:38.257
you're going
to have to pay, Machuca.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.890
I can't have you go on
into town and be like,

22:40.892 --> 22:43.728
"You know, I tell El Guapo
and he believe me."

22:44.197 --> 22:45.697
No. No.

22:46.665 --> 22:47.998
It's nothing personal,
Machuca,

22:48.000 --> 22:49.769
but just next time...

22:51.671 --> 22:53.771
don't be so damn convincing.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.511
Next time, Machuca.

22:58.579 --> 22:59.246
That's a good one.
Next time.

22:59.745 --> 23:00.713
Yeah.

23:01.448 --> 23:02.915
Okay, do you thing.

23:04.251 --> 23:05.883
Baby, you make me
some fresh Parmesan, yeah?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.354
This stuff is stale.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.522
Baby, you said you wanted
to be a stay at home mom

23:10.524 --> 23:11.389
This was stale...

23:28.709 --> 23:29.444
On second thought...

23:30.512 --> 23:31.880
bring him with you.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.982
You never know.

23:36.918 --> 23:38.686
He said.

23:39.154 --> 23:39.854
He said!

23:57.606 --> 23:59.039
How much is it, Fink?

23:59.041 --> 24:00.541
Shh. I'm counting.

24:00.543 --> 24:02.376
Pay attention. I do not want
to get lost right now.

24:02.378 --> 24:03.712
We're not going to get lost.

24:05.047 --> 24:07.649
Fink, would you rather
be a metal detector or a GPS?

24:07.651 --> 24:09.384
Metal detector tells you
where the gold is,

24:09.386 --> 24:11.352
but it wouldn't do you any good
if you're lost.

24:11.354 --> 24:12.556
So I'd be the GPS.

24:13.623 --> 24:14.821
You're not a GPS, so be quiet.

24:14.823 --> 24:16.293
I'm just saying, if I was one.

24:17.327 --> 24:18.295
Wait, are you saying we're lost?

24:19.229 --> 24:20.662
No, but if I were a GPS,

24:20.664 --> 24:22.063
- I might be saying that.
- Okay, well,

24:22.065 --> 24:24.000
you're about as far
from a GPS as you can get.

24:25.035 --> 24:26.501
I'm aware of that.

24:26.503 --> 24:27.302
- I'm saying, if I was one.
- Moses, be quiet

24:27.304 --> 24:28.506
and pay attention.

24:29.574 --> 24:31.341
We do not want
to get lost right now.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.516
Moses. Moses...

24:39.283 --> 24:42.453
We have 310 of these.

24:43.854 --> 24:46.222
- We have 310 of these.
- That's... how much is that?

24:46.224 --> 24:49.760
That's $3,100,000.

24:51.862 --> 24:52.730
We...

24:56.602 --> 24:57.636
Moses, where are we?

25:00.572 --> 25:01.973
What was that?

25:03.141 --> 25:05.444
It was a bat...
I think.

25:06.278 --> 25:07.713
Watching the headlights.

25:08.779 --> 25:10.146
I think it was a bat.
It was a bat.

25:10.148 --> 25:11.917
No, it sounded
more like a cape.

25:12.818 --> 25:14.453
- A cape?
- On a guy.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.853
- Like a bad guy.
- No, Moses, look at me.

25:16.855 --> 25:17.724
Hey...

25:19.124 --> 25:22.194
The bees out here make honey
in the carcass of a dead animal,

25:23.563 --> 25:25.265
and these bats, they just follow
the bees to the blood honey.

25:26.132 --> 25:27.267
So the dead Santa guy...?

25:28.434 --> 25:30.503
Oh, yeah. Lots of honey.

25:32.538 --> 25:34.540
I'm sorry I got us lost,
Fink.

25:35.675 --> 25:36.774
Maybe we should just
camp here till morning.

25:36.776 --> 25:38.876
No, we can't.
Whoever lost this money

25:38.878 --> 25:40.177
is going to come
looking for it.

25:40.179 --> 25:42.416
So the sooner we get
out of here, the better.

25:43.651 --> 25:45.216
Okay, okay. I just don't know
which way to go.

25:45.218 --> 25:45.918
Well...

25:47.688 --> 25:48.555
southwest.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.026
How do you know
that's southwest?

25:52.760 --> 25:54.760
Venus and Jupiter.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.664
What would I do
if I didn't have you

25:58.666 --> 26:01.535
- to do all the thinking?
- Thank you, my man.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.141
What are... why are you...
why are you doing that?

26:08.008 --> 26:08.677
Money.

26:09.810 --> 26:10.576
Fink and Moses
are rife with it.

26:10.578 --> 26:11.812
I did it!

26:12.946 --> 26:14.649
That was pretty good.
Now pay attention.

26:15.383 --> 26:16.582
I did it first try.

26:16.584 --> 26:17.383
Because you weren't
overthinking it.

26:17.385 --> 26:18.584
I focused on the cash.

26:18.586 --> 26:19.786
Now focus on where
you're going.

26:19.788 --> 26:21.423
And I totally,
totally nailed it.

26:22.290 --> 26:23.489
Hey, now that we're rich,

26:23.491 --> 26:24.991
maybe I could become
an actor again.

26:24.993 --> 26:27.628
No, Moses. That's not a...
that's not a great idea.

26:27.630 --> 26:29.062
I bet I could buy
a super-good part...

26:29.064 --> 26:30.965
Hey, look out!

27:02.432 --> 27:03.832
She's alive.

27:03.834 --> 27:05.736
- What do we do?
- Where'd she come from?

27:05.936 --> 27:08.136
How's a kid end up...
what are you doing?

27:08.138 --> 27:09.673
We got to help her,
right?

27:11.541 --> 27:13.410
- I'll get the door.
- Get the door.

27:14.010 --> 27:14.679
I'll drive.

27:17.414 --> 27:19.417
Grab her legs. Grab her legs.

27:29.260 --> 27:32.630
She's breathing. Maybe I just
barely squished her.

27:33.564 --> 27:34.665
She's a cute kid.

27:35.801 --> 27:37.533
Wow, look at that moon.

27:37.535 --> 27:39.569
Fink, have you ever seen
a moon like that before?

27:39.571 --> 27:40.804
Moses...

27:40.806 --> 27:42.238
I've never seen
a moon like that.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.443
Moses, I do not care
about the moon right now.

27:45.644 --> 27:47.346
She's cute. Don't you think
she's cute?

27:48.247 --> 27:49.681
- The moon?
- The kid.

27:50.783 --> 27:53.585
How does a kid wind up
out here alone?

27:55.053 --> 27:57.421
Hey, Fink, would you rather be
a super-rich famous movie star

27:57.423 --> 27:58.422
with no kids,

27:58.424 --> 28:00.592
or a poor nobody
with a kid?

28:01.427 --> 28:02.327
How does that even happen?

28:03.730 --> 28:05.128
Simple. They put too much
focus on their career,

28:05.130 --> 28:06.697
and before you know it,
they're old.

28:06.699 --> 28:10.837
Moses, how does a kid
wind up out here alone?

28:11.704 --> 28:12.505
The dead Santa guy, maybe?

28:13.239 --> 28:14.472
I don't know about that,

28:14.474 --> 28:15.873
but I'm taking the poor nobody
with a kid.

28:15.875 --> 28:17.208
Which one are you
taking, Fink?

28:17.210 --> 28:19.744
I'm not taking either,
because I'm not playing.

28:19.746 --> 28:22.182
We're not doing this right now.

28:23.683 --> 28:25.583
Does the poor nobody
have a wife?

28:25.585 --> 28:26.921
No wife.

28:28.021 --> 28:29.655
Okay, then I'm taking
the movie star,

28:29.657 --> 28:31.890
because at least then I could
get Joy Lynn to marry me.

28:31.892 --> 28:33.527
Ah, but you couldn't
have kids.

28:34.127 --> 28:34.994
No kids ever?

28:35.463 --> 28:36.197
Never.

28:36.864 --> 28:37.964
Then...

28:39.233 --> 28:40.734
I don't want to play right now.
I'm not doing this.

28:41.969 --> 28:43.571
I'm taking the poor nobody
with a kid.

28:44.672 --> 28:46.741
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

28:47.475 --> 28:48.976
I know where I am.

28:56.852 --> 28:58.587
What are we doing?

29:10.131 --> 29:11.500
- Fink...
- Shh!

29:14.569 --> 29:16.371
Why are we looking at our house?

29:17.807 --> 29:19.341
Moses, our house is the only
thing out here for 100 miles.

29:20.776 --> 29:22.712
What do you bet whoever lost
that money starts right there?

29:24.145 --> 29:25.346
Wouldn't they start out
by the truck and the plane

29:25.348 --> 29:26.382
where the money was?

29:27.717 --> 29:29.250
That's a good point.

29:29.252 --> 29:30.586
I didn't think of that.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.221
You're probably right.

29:33.489 --> 29:35.826
All this money and the kid
got me ruffled.

30:14.399 --> 30:16.732
- Fink...
- I turned them right off, okay?

30:16.734 --> 30:18.969
Was just for a second.
Maybe they didn't see.

30:18.971 --> 30:20.403
Think they can hear the engine?

30:20.405 --> 30:21.807
- Fink...
- Moses,

30:23.042 --> 30:23.840
would you let me get us down
this mountain?

30:23.842 --> 30:25.543
Fink, she's waking up.

30:26.011 --> 30:26.879
Agua.

30:29.648 --> 30:30.847
...por favor.

30:35.554 --> 30:38.057
No, wait.
No, we wouldn't do that.

30:39.358 --> 30:40.359
Yeah, yeah, we're your friends.
We want to help you.

30:41.126 --> 30:41.962
Do you speak English?

30:42.728 --> 30:44.496
Did El Guapo send you?

30:44.998 --> 30:45.830
Who?

30:45.832 --> 30:46.699
The Handsome One?

30:46.933 --> 30:48.567
- Does she mean you or me?
- No, no.

30:49.636 --> 30:51.037
The drug cartel boss
in Mexico.

30:53.506 --> 30:54.874
Doggone it. Stop.

30:56.175 --> 30:57.644
How do you know
about El Guapo?

30:58.278 --> 30:59.579
I belong to him.

31:15.763 --> 31:17.732
- They might have heard that.
- Doggone it.

33:17.189 --> 33:18.557
What are you doing?

33:19.592 --> 33:20.726
Right now,
what are you doing?

33:22.194 --> 33:24.497
No killing until you find
my money and my lost boy.

33:25.898 --> 33:27.867
Okay? And then you can have
a slaughterfest for all I care.

33:35.142 --> 33:36.575
Come on, make it happen!

35:00.697 --> 35:02.498
How long do we
have to wait?

35:03.499 --> 35:04.432
I don't know.

35:04.434 --> 35:06.170
He should be here by now.

35:07.604 --> 35:09.838
Do you think the handsome one
killed the guy in the truck?

35:09.840 --> 35:11.541
And who do you think
was flying the plane?

35:12.276 --> 35:12.977
I admire that guy.

35:13.811 --> 35:14.612
You admire a drug dealer?

35:15.478 --> 35:16.612
The pilot's
not the dealer.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.880
He's probably some guy
just like us,

35:17.882 --> 35:19.149
trying to do
something great.

35:20.451 --> 35:23.821
Moses, flying drugs
over the border is not great.

35:24.855 --> 35:26.322
Flying a plane
in the dark

35:26.324 --> 35:28.857
without navigation
or bathroom or snacks

35:28.859 --> 35:30.561
is brave and great
in my book.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.498
Hey, Fink, would you rather
do something

35:36.500 --> 35:37.903
really brave and great
just once,

35:39.304 --> 35:40.238
or live in a palace with
all the money in the world?

35:41.405 --> 35:42.540
There's no way I'm doing
to do this right now.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.009
You know what I think?

35:45.143 --> 35:46.411
I think every person
comes into this world

35:47.612 --> 35:49.014
with special particles
built into their DNA.

35:49.614 --> 35:50.548
Like pixie dust.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.082
Pixie dust.

35:52.084 --> 35:52.884
Doctors can't see it,

35:54.287 --> 35:55.388
because it doesn't fall into
the laws of the physical world,

35:56.521 --> 35:57.857
like flesh, or blood,
or bone, or time.

35:59.058 --> 36:00.458
What's the word of something
beyond time?

36:01.060 --> 36:01.794
Eternity?

36:03.162 --> 36:04.497
I think there are sparkling
particles of eternity

36:05.564 --> 36:06.830
banging around
inside each one of us,

36:06.832 --> 36:08.368
and they're programmed
before we're even born

36:09.535 --> 36:10.836
to do something great
and true and wonderful.

36:12.272 --> 36:14.073
And each person's particles
are specific just to him.

36:15.041 --> 36:16.874
This is all
just coming to me, Fink.

36:16.876 --> 36:18.509
You want to hear
something amazing?

36:18.511 --> 36:20.013
For the first time
in my life,

36:20.446 --> 36:22.816
I know what my dust particles
are programmed to do.

36:23.549 --> 36:24.251
You want to hear?

36:25.285 --> 36:26.584
- No.
- I'm supposed to save this kid

36:26.586 --> 36:28.355
and bring the handsome one
to justice.

36:29.423 --> 36:30.889
I know it.
I was made for it.

36:30.891 --> 36:33.326
It's kind of like my orphanage
idea, but different.

36:33.328 --> 36:34.528
It's perfect.

36:35.696 --> 36:39.167
The dust, it always
speaks the truth.

36:40.401 --> 36:41.902
What are your dust particles
saying, Fink?

36:42.502 --> 36:43.171
What say you?

36:44.038 --> 36:45.905
I don't have dust particles.

36:45.907 --> 36:47.041
Oh, come on.

36:48.309 --> 36:49.342
And you do wanna do something
more in your life

36:49.344 --> 36:50.979
than just find
a ton of money.

36:52.313 --> 36:53.247
Or more than just wanting
to marry that girl

36:54.349 --> 36:55.216
who gave you her photo
a long time ago.

36:55.817 --> 36:56.651
Joan Fairmont.

36:57.386 --> 36:58.820
It's Joy Lynn Fairbanks.

36:59.421 --> 37:00.356
You know that.

37:01.522 --> 37:02.657
Of course I wanted
to do something great.

37:03.258 --> 37:04.360
Everyone does.

37:04.959 --> 37:05.793
I wanted...

37:06.661 --> 37:07.997
I wanted to win her heart.

37:09.530 --> 37:12.034
That's the great thing
I wanted to do.

37:12.835 --> 37:14.069
Well, that's okay.

37:15.337 --> 37:17.740
I thought about how to do it
for a long time.

37:18.441 --> 37:19.773
I practiced at home,

37:19.775 --> 37:21.844
in the shower mostly,
for months.

37:23.213 --> 37:25.382
And I really thought
I was ready, I really did.

37:26.048 --> 37:27.049
I...

37:28.118 --> 37:29.486
I knew I had it in me.
I knew I did.

37:30.220 --> 37:31.221
I knew I could do it.

37:32.055 --> 37:33.189
Do what, Fink?

37:34.057 --> 37:35.589
Sing, opera.

37:35.591 --> 37:38.695
Really great classical opera
at the school talent show.

37:39.429 --> 37:40.862
Something was telling...

37:40.864 --> 37:41.963
maybe it was your magical
little dust devils,

37:41.965 --> 37:43.666
but something
was telling me.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.970
I had this amazing operatic
voice inside of me,

37:48.038 --> 37:49.039
and all I had to do
was trust it,

37:50.207 --> 37:51.007
and open my mouth,
and let it out.

37:51.741 --> 37:54.711
And I truly believed

37:55.578 --> 37:57.248
that once I started singing,

37:57.982 --> 37:59.784
Joy would look up at me,

38:00.518 --> 38:01.952
surprised,

38:03.054 --> 38:05.956
and her heard would melt
with love for me.

38:08.527 --> 38:11.263
And we'd live
happily ever after.

38:12.897 --> 38:14.399
Did you ever sing?

38:16.201 --> 38:17.402
Uh...

38:18.003 --> 38:19.637
yeah, I did.

38:20.505 --> 38:21.371
I walked up
on that stage

38:21.373 --> 38:22.874
and the music started,

38:24.042 --> 38:25.607
and I found where
she was sitting,

38:25.609 --> 38:27.944
in the back with a boy,

38:27.946 --> 38:30.682
and I looked
into her eyes

38:31.551 --> 38:33.218
and I pointed right at her.

38:34.253 --> 38:37.956
And I sang an Italian
opera song.

38:39.092 --> 38:40.324
I didn't know
you spoke Italian.

38:40.326 --> 38:42.859
I don't. I just learned
the words to one song.

38:42.861 --> 38:44.895
It didn't matter, though.
Everyone started laughing,

38:44.897 --> 38:47.967
and pretty soon I couldn't hear
myself over the music.

38:49.135 --> 38:50.870
I ran off stage before
the music ever finished.

38:51.572 --> 38:52.805
Joy ever say anything?

38:53.406 --> 38:54.541
Not really.

38:56.242 --> 38:58.945
I mean, she and the boy

38:59.812 --> 39:01.379
ran into me in the hall once,

39:01.381 --> 39:04.151
and they both pointed at me,
the way I had pointed at her,

39:04.884 --> 39:05.651
and started laughing.

39:06.520 --> 39:09.356
I never won her heart, Moses.

39:10.357 --> 39:11.558
I never did.

39:13.127 --> 39:16.498
I listened to your magic dust
and I failed.

39:17.965 --> 39:19.798
Well, maybe you just
didn't sing loud enough.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.835
- Maybe you didn't sing long enough.
- No, No No!

39:22.403 --> 39:23.203
I failed.

39:24.305 --> 39:25.639
Sometimes your stupid magic dust
is wrong.

39:26.574 --> 39:27.941
- But...
- No, no, no. Shh, shh.

39:34.883 --> 39:37.685
They're kids.

39:43.526 --> 39:45.126
With guns.

39:53.668 --> 39:55.670
No, no, no.

40:29.507 --> 40:31.609
What are you doing right now?

40:32.976 --> 40:34.476
What are you doing?
Are we driving right now?

40:34.478 --> 40:36.947
Let's go, make it happen.

41:11.850 --> 41:13.618
Fink, you should
offload some of the cash.

41:13.620 --> 41:15.151
You could come back
for it later.

41:15.153 --> 41:16.621
No way. Everyone tries that,

41:16.623 --> 41:18.190
they never find it again.

41:19.692 --> 41:20.890
Hey, kid, I just realized,

41:20.892 --> 41:22.125
we don't know your name.

41:22.127 --> 41:23.128
Maggie.

41:24.129 --> 41:24.796
That's a good name.

41:25.964 --> 41:28.368
My name's Moses,
and that's my best friend Fink.

41:29.569 --> 41:30.767
You sure you don't want
to get on my shoulders?

41:30.769 --> 41:32.138
It's okay.

41:33.473 --> 41:35.239
I still think we make
for the dry lake bed,

41:35.241 --> 41:37.310
take the dead guy's truck
and get out of there.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.512
Moses, there's no magic trail
that takes us back to that lake.

41:40.514 --> 41:42.382
It was a fluke
we found it once.

41:43.484 --> 41:44.849
No. We got to
the silver reef mine.

41:44.851 --> 41:47.120
You got phone service there
once, remember?

41:48.322 --> 41:49.122
We call for help,
we hide and we wait.

41:50.357 --> 41:51.657
I don't like that mine.
It gives me the creeps.

41:51.659 --> 41:53.425
It's like a tomb. It's got bats.
I don't like it.

41:53.427 --> 41:55.429
That's too bad.
That's where we're going.

41:56.163 --> 41:58.332
I don't like bats.

41:59.199 --> 42:00.301
Maggie.

42:01.035 --> 42:02.836
Maggie, come on.

42:09.176 --> 42:10.612
Seriously?

42:11.346 --> 42:12.046
What do you call that?

42:13.047 --> 42:15.682
Bullshit,
that's what I call it.

42:15.684 --> 42:18.351
Now, I want you to look me
in the eye, mijo,

42:18.353 --> 42:21.022
because this
is going to be

42:21.756 --> 42:23.892
the last thing you see

42:24.492 --> 42:26.794
before I rip out

42:26.796 --> 42:28.096
your eyes.

42:31.299 --> 42:32.768
Comprende, mijo?

42:33.602 --> 42:35.103
So guess what?

42:35.870 --> 42:36.772
We're gonna do it again.

42:38.207 --> 42:40.142
We're gonna... hey, you get back
here or I will fry you in oil.

42:44.815 --> 42:46.415
I think I need a man trip.

42:47.016 --> 42:47.850
Maybe Miami.

42:49.018 --> 42:52.221
Rocco's Tacos.
Loud music, yeah!

42:57.159 --> 42:59.262
Did you use fresh limes?

43:00.430 --> 43:01.529
Because that's what
a stay-at-home mom does.

43:01.531 --> 43:03.633
She uses the fresh limes.

43:06.136 --> 43:08.305
Do you think I have ADD?

43:08.905 --> 43:09.938
Okay,

43:09.940 --> 43:12.376
everybody get back here,

43:13.543 --> 43:14.744
or else nobody's getting
a Popsicle ever again,

43:14.746 --> 43:17.314
and I promise I will
shoot you both.

43:18.449 --> 43:21.486
Now, let's go.
Let's dance. Yeah!

43:24.955 --> 43:26.655
One of the men is grande.

43:30.361 --> 43:32.294
We don't
know if they have weapons!

43:32.296 --> 43:33.462
They are prospectors.

43:33.464 --> 43:34.997
They care solamente
for the gold.

43:34.999 --> 43:36.232
Even if they have weapons,

43:36.234 --> 43:37.667
they have no idea
cómo usarlos.

43:39.738 --> 43:40.670
They are no match for me...

43:44.108 --> 43:46.545
You're both greedy
little varmints. Mira.

43:47.912 --> 43:49.013
If we travel all night,
we could have them by morning.

43:49.515 --> 43:50.816
Vámonos.

44:14.374 --> 44:15.475
Anything?

44:16.342 --> 44:17.542
No. I sent some texts to Pete

44:17.544 --> 44:18.709
with the Bureau
of Land Management.

44:18.711 --> 44:20.146
He's the only one
who's ever out this far.

44:20.881 --> 44:21.849
And my mom, of course.

44:22.949 --> 44:24.250
You never know.
They might go through.

44:25.418 --> 44:26.553
Hey, Fink, how come you never
got a phone?

44:27.688 --> 44:28.522
I don't need a phone.
You have a phone.

44:29.757 --> 44:31.157
No, no, no.
No, we have to be careful.

44:33.527 --> 44:35.962
Ah. I don't think so.

44:37.130 --> 44:38.599
Do you have any food?

44:39.333 --> 44:40.132
Santa ate all the food.

44:40.134 --> 44:41.368
I have a protein bar.

44:41.969 --> 44:42.970
Wait. Santa?

44:44.205 --> 44:44.972
Is he the guy in the jeep,
at the lake?

44:46.006 --> 44:46.674
He always drives us
back home.

44:47.374 --> 44:48.509
Where's home?

44:49.243 --> 44:50.211
The hotel in Mexico.

44:51.078 --> 44:52.046
So, who flies
the plane?

44:52.514 --> 44:53.380
I do.

44:54.181 --> 44:55.316
You fly the plane?

44:56.518 --> 44:57.652
El Chon teaches us
when we're young.

44:58.386 --> 44:59.387
I learned two years ago.

45:00.322 --> 45:01.055
El Chon? What does that mean?

45:01.857 --> 45:02.791
A big old guy.

45:03.859 --> 45:04.926
He works for El Guapo
at the hotel.

45:05.861 --> 45:06.862
He guards all
the children.

45:07.897 --> 45:09.464
There are other children
at the hotel?

45:10.365 --> 45:12.167
Lots. El Guapo
steals children.

45:13.034 --> 45:14.169
American children, usually.

45:15.303 --> 45:16.238
Makes it easier
to cross the border.

45:17.405 --> 45:19.040
I don't remember
when he stole me.

45:20.108 --> 45:22.110
And... and all the kids
fly for Guapo?

45:22.845 --> 45:24.010
We try, but a lot crash,

45:24.012 --> 45:25.882
so they always need
more children.

45:26.616 --> 45:28.251
What if a kid can't fly?

45:29.652 --> 45:31.254
All lost boys fly.

45:32.288 --> 45:33.389
That's what Guapo
calls us.

45:34.457 --> 45:36.192
He says the pixie dust
makes us fly.

45:37.393 --> 45:39.997
Pixie dust?
Are you hearing this, Fink?

45:41.097 --> 45:42.263
What do you mean,
pixie dust?

45:42.265 --> 45:44.401
Magic dust.
That's how we fly.

45:45.836 --> 45:47.538
They put it in bags and tie it
to the bottom of our plane.

45:48.572 --> 45:49.871
They tied a lot to mine
on this trip.

45:49.873 --> 45:51.108
It was very heavy.

45:52.276 --> 45:54.376
El Guapo says the more
pixie dust you have,

45:54.378 --> 45:55.679
the safer you are.

45:56.413 --> 45:57.548
But I don't think so,

45:58.248 --> 45:59.049
because I couldn't fly
very high.

45:59.784 --> 46:00.985
Do you have any water?

46:02.553 --> 46:05.188
Magic dust?
This is no coincidence.

46:06.290 --> 46:07.490
And my magic dust
is telling me

46:07.492 --> 46:08.225
I'm going to save
all these kids

46:09.259 --> 46:10.393
and kick El Chapo's
buttocks.

46:10.395 --> 46:12.395
- It's Guapo.
- I'm coming for you,

46:12.397 --> 46:13.362
big handsome one.

46:13.364 --> 46:14.866
Stop yelling.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.668
Chon is the big one.

46:17.970 --> 46:19.337
Guapo is the handsome one.

46:20.638 --> 46:22.240
You're both big,
ugly jackasses in my book.

46:23.641 --> 46:27.111
El Guapo says as long
as you have the magic dust

46:27.713 --> 46:29.014
you can't cry.

46:29.882 --> 46:31.249
But some lost boys still do.

46:32.317 --> 46:34.053
I don't think
it's real pixie dust.

46:35.086 --> 46:36.118
We got to save her, Fink.

46:36.120 --> 46:38.123
- We got to.
- Yeah, I know.

46:39.158 --> 46:40.392
Promise me we're going
to save her.

46:41.827 --> 46:42.996
I promise.

46:44.064 --> 46:45.664
That was the last of the water.

46:46.298 --> 46:47.033
I know.

46:50.369 --> 46:51.671
Fear.

46:52.806 --> 46:54.306
The big handsome one
is rife with it.

I got service.

49:51.658 --> 49:52.692
Maggie?

49:53.627 --> 49:54.996
They're here.

49:58.298 --> 49:59.332
Who's here?

50:00.201 --> 50:02.103
The ones who take the children.

50:04.437 --> 50:05.173
Shh.

50:06.040 --> 50:08.342
Listen.

50:09.310 --> 50:11.612
Get her, quick.
Get in the mine.

50:31.200 --> 50:35.305
They were
here last night. We just missed them.

50:36.772 --> 50:38.107
They
can't be that far. Let's hurry!

50:44.413 --> 50:45.915
My mom.

50:48.650 --> 50:50.220
In the mine!

50:51.888 --> 50:53.523
Do you speak English or Spanish?

50:56.059 --> 50:57.994
We know you are in there.

50:59.296 --> 51:01.332
We know about the Lost Boy.

51:02.599 --> 51:03.499
What did he say?

51:04.235 --> 51:05.633
They know we're in here.

51:05.635 --> 51:06.703
And they know about her.

51:08.638 --> 51:13.376
Give back the girl to
us, and we will not harm you.

51:16.479 --> 51:19.147
He said they won't hurt us
if we send her out.

51:19.149 --> 51:20.350
The hell-

51:20.352 --> 51:22.486
Shh! Shh!

51:23.087 --> 51:24.622
Would you stop?

51:26.023 --> 51:28.126
They're not taking her
while I'm still standing.

51:29.627 --> 51:31.462
Tell them we'll trade
for the money.

51:31.897 --> 51:32.730
Tell them, Fink.

51:36.134 --> 51:36.801
Uh...

51:38.370 --> 51:41.873
We do not
want any harm to come to the girl.

51:42.707 --> 51:43.642
Did you tell them?

51:44.976 --> 51:45.644
I told them.

51:47.280 --> 51:50.383
We have no
wish to see the girl harmed either.

51:51.850 --> 51:54.686
But we
do intend to take her with us.

51:56.188 --> 51:57.323
He doesn't want the money.

51:58.623 --> 51:59.292
He just wants her.
He said he wouldn't hurt her.

52:00.259 --> 52:01.661
Like we can believe that.

52:02.395 --> 52:03.930
I think he means it.

52:05.131 --> 52:06.964
Well, does he know
how much money is there?

52:06.966 --> 52:08.301
Did you tell him?

52:09.001 --> 52:09.969
Tell him, Fink.

52:12.872 --> 52:17.877
We care
about the girl... a lot!

52:20.479 --> 52:25.451
I have given my
word, but I will waste no more time.

52:27.621 --> 52:32.626
He doesn't care how much it is.
He said he just wants her now.

52:33.226 --> 52:34.461
Oh, yeah?

52:42.337 --> 52:43.670
It's okay.

52:44.138 --> 52:44.805
I'll go.

52:45.840 --> 52:47.674
I'll be all right.
I will.

52:48.542 --> 52:50.445
And you've been
so nice to me.

52:54.148 --> 52:55.750
I'll leave you a trail.

52:57.685 --> 52:59.120
Thank you, Mr. Fink.

53:00.356 --> 53:03.292
Thank you, Mr. Moses.
I will never forget you.

53:18.640 --> 53:19.306
Would you leave it?

53:19.308 --> 53:19.975
There's no time.

53:20.175 --> 53:21.176
Look, he comes.

53:22.379 --> 53:23.746
He just spoke English.

53:24.481 --> 53:25.448
And we gave her up.

53:26.316 --> 53:27.384
They were going to kill us.

53:27.983 --> 53:28.817
I don't care.

53:29.986 --> 53:31.520
We gave up a little girl
to save our own skins.

53:35.091 --> 53:36.126
Wait.

53:36.860 --> 53:37.761
What's that sound?

53:38.361 --> 53:39.528
I don't care.

53:41.831 --> 53:43.666
Moses...

53:44.934 --> 53:46.102
Moses.

53:47.037 --> 53:48.203
- Moses, get up.
- I don't care.

53:48.205 --> 53:50.573
Get up. Run.

53:55.279 --> 53:58.581
This is as deep as it goes.
We're trapped.

54:59.612 --> 55:00.947
Leave it!

55:01.814 --> 55:03.015
Would you leave it?

55:03.749 --> 55:04.851
Come on.

55:12.192 --> 55:13.961
Look, they left a bike.

55:15.696 --> 55:16.997
Fink, what are you doing?

55:17.764 --> 55:18.466
Taking his keys.

55:19.066 --> 55:20.167
Good idea.

55:21.268 --> 55:22.504
No keys.

55:22.970 --> 55:23.935
Aah!

55:23.937 --> 55:24.936
Face me!

55:24.938 --> 55:26.073
Who are you?

55:32.013 --> 55:33.079
What are you doing?

55:33.081 --> 55:34.380
Hey, don't touch that.

55:34.382 --> 55:36.382
Don't you touch that.
Leave that alone.

55:36.384 --> 55:38.621
Fink, I got it.

55:41.956 --> 55:43.322
I see your face.

55:43.324 --> 55:45.758
I see your face.
I'm memorizing your face.

55:45.760 --> 55:47.596
And you know what's going to
happen when I memorize your...

55:51.233 --> 55:52.401
Come on, get on, get on.

55:57.907 --> 55:59.642
Oh!

57:03.609 --> 57:06.511
- Do you see him?
- Not yet. I can't get any speed.

57:07.679 --> 57:08.912
We're going to have
to ditch the cash.

57:08.914 --> 57:10.113
- No!
- We don't have a choice.

57:10.115 --> 57:11.348
I'm not ditching the cash.

57:11.350 --> 57:12.983
- We'll split up.
- What?

57:12.985 --> 57:14.017
We have
a better chance.

57:14.019 --> 57:15.118
We're not
splitting up.

57:15.120 --> 57:17.387
- Just dump the bag.
- Never! Drop me there.

57:17.389 --> 57:19.356
- Up ahead.
- No, I don't want to.

57:19.358 --> 57:21.226
- Moses, stop, stop!
- No, I don't want...

57:23.862 --> 57:25.498
Look, half of this
is yours.

57:26.064 --> 57:26.765
I don't want it.

57:27.500 --> 57:28.201
Let's just leave it.

57:29.335 --> 57:30.136
Nothing good has happened
since we found it.

57:31.170 --> 57:32.436
Now we're talking about
splitting up.

57:32.438 --> 57:33.971
- It's bad luck, Fink.
- No, listen, listen.

57:33.973 --> 57:36.609
I'm going to hide it somewhere,
then we'll meet up back in town.

57:37.010 --> 57:39.145
- I'm not going back.
- What do you mean you are going back?

57:40.313 --> 57:41.482
I'm not going back
until I find Maggie.

57:42.215 --> 57:43.649
That's my new quest.

57:43.651 --> 57:44.917
That's what my magic dust
is telling me to do.

57:46.052 --> 57:48.921
I can't go with you.
I'm sorry, but I can't.

57:50.857 --> 57:52.257
What are you going to do?

57:52.259 --> 57:54.861
He's going to be here
any minute, so you got to go.

57:56.330 --> 57:58.198
Go. And...

58:01.001 --> 58:02.136
goodbye, Moses.

58:06.807 --> 58:09.611
You're the best and only friend
I ever had, Fink.

58:10.478 --> 58:11.379
So this is not goodbye, okay?

58:12.781 --> 58:13.812
We're going to see each
other again soon, I promise.

58:13.814 --> 58:14.982
As soon as I find her.

58:15.916 --> 58:17.385
- I hope so.
- I know so.

58:19.654 --> 58:22.223
You know what I just realized?
I don't know your first name.

58:23.058 --> 58:24.592
- Oh...
- Wait, I do.

58:25.193 --> 58:25.860
From the photo.

58:26.461 --> 58:27.162
It's Troy.

58:27.730 --> 58:30.332
No, it's Jules.

58:30.932 --> 58:31.966
But the photo...

58:33.602 --> 58:34.770
Jules?

58:35.371 --> 58:36.439
Yeah. Not Troy.

58:38.107 --> 58:40.142
Well, Jules is a great name.

58:41.610 --> 58:43.579
I don't know
your first name either.

58:44.180 --> 58:45.147
It's stupid.

58:46.215 --> 58:49.786
That's... Stupid
is your Christian name?

58:50.754 --> 58:51.755
Delbert.
It was my dad's name.

58:52.988 --> 58:55.091
Oh. Delbert. Well, that actually
works with Moses.

58:57.527 --> 58:59.161
Be careful.

58:59.596 --> 59:01.130
You too.

59:02.165 --> 59:03.565
Jules, would you rather be...?

59:03.567 --> 59:05.066
No, not right now.

59:05.068 --> 59:06.935
- Would you rather be a...?
- Moses, don't do this.

59:06.937 --> 59:09.439
- Jules, would you rather be a...?
- Moses, stop!

59:10.507 --> 59:12.175
I'd rather be you.

59:13.778 --> 59:15.479
I'd rather be you.

59:16.681 --> 59:20.451
Jules, the dust is never wrong.
Don't forget it.

59:21.719 --> 59:22.785
You do have a great opera voice
in there somewhere,

59:22.787 --> 59:24.589
whether that girl
noticed you or not.

59:25.323 --> 59:26.624
You do. You do. You do.

59:28.025 --> 59:29.794
And if you ever get a chance
to sing again, you got to do it.

59:30.728 --> 59:31.763
Promise me you're going
to do it.

59:32.497 --> 59:33.364
Say, "I promise."

59:36.067 --> 59:36.769
I promise.

59:38.169 --> 59:41.573
Opera!
Jules Fink is rife with it!

59:45.109 --> 59:46.944
Look, he's coming. Go!

59:48.480 --> 59:49.515
Go now.

59:59.191 --> 01:00:01.628
I love you, Jules Fink!

01:03:26.207 --> 01:03:27.174
Do not test me.

01:03:29.377 --> 01:03:30.112
Okay.

01:03:30.611 --> 01:03:31.379
Move.

01:03:40.122 --> 01:03:41.755
You found my trail.
You found it.

01:03:41.757 --> 01:03:43.257
I knew you'd find it.

01:03:44.126 --> 01:03:45.360
You trust this one?

01:03:47.963 --> 01:03:50.332
Okay, what's going on?

01:03:51.266 --> 01:03:52.499
Give him water.
Fetch his bike.

01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:54.503
Leave no trace
for the dancing one.

01:03:56.805 --> 01:03:57.639
Sit.

01:04:33.077 --> 01:04:36.480
Oh yeah...

01:04:54.999 --> 01:04:57.502
Are you dead, bro?

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:04.340
Thought you were
KO'd there, man.

01:05:04.342 --> 01:05:05.310
Need a lift?

01:05:11.817 --> 01:05:13.451
Climb in.

01:05:35.976 --> 01:05:38.078
- Water?
- Thank you.

01:05:38.678 --> 01:05:39.679
Thank you.

01:05:42.082 --> 01:05:44.184
Hey, easy, bro.

01:05:45.819 --> 01:05:47.786
- Thank you.
- No worries, dude.

01:05:47.788 --> 01:05:49.890
We're just headed
back to civvie.

01:05:50.624 --> 01:05:51.556
As in, -lization.

01:05:51.558 --> 01:05:52.891
Are you good with that?

01:05:52.893 --> 01:05:54.594
Thank you, yes.
Thank you.

01:05:55.263 --> 01:05:56.496
Right-o.

01:05:57.899 --> 01:06:00.199
Like I was saying,
the Canyon of Sorrows.

01:06:00.201 --> 01:06:01.566
Navajo territory.

01:06:01.568 --> 01:06:04.804
- No.
- Yes. One mile across.

01:06:04.806 --> 01:06:06.304
Dude.

01:06:06.306 --> 01:06:08.474
Figured I needed
a half-mile running start.

01:06:08.476 --> 01:06:11.010
So I lowered my goggles
and hammered it.

01:06:11.012 --> 01:06:13.014
- No.
- Yes.

01:06:13.848 --> 01:06:14.947
But I didn't quite clear it.

01:06:14.949 --> 01:06:16.249
No.

01:06:16.251 --> 01:06:19.119
I lost
consciousness on impact man!

01:06:19.121 --> 01:06:20.419
Dude.

01:06:20.421 --> 01:06:23.123
I broke my femur, ankle,

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:26.760
humerus, my scapula,
my clavicle,

01:06:26.762 --> 01:06:28.995
my pelvis.
a lot of ribs,

01:06:28.997 --> 01:06:32.165
and I was bleeding from
somewhere deep within, man.

01:06:32.167 --> 01:06:34.434
- Whoa.
- But you know what?

01:06:34.436 --> 01:06:37.439
- What?
- I caught massive air!

01:06:38.774 --> 01:06:40.310
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

01:06:41.443 --> 01:06:44.544
I broke every vertebrae
in my body.

01:06:44.546 --> 01:06:46.479
- Bro!
- Had a steel rod

01:06:46.481 --> 01:06:48.481
inserted into my leg.

01:06:48.483 --> 01:06:49.817
No!

01:06:49.819 --> 01:06:51.451
- But you know what?
- What?

01:06:51.453 --> 01:06:54.724
I caught massive air.

01:06:55.357 --> 01:06:56.492
Yeah.

01:06:57.493 --> 01:07:00.494
Boulder dam dude, 2006.

01:07:00.496 --> 01:07:01.629
Awesome.

01:07:01.631 --> 01:07:03.200
Impossible, you say?

01:07:03.933 --> 01:07:04.968
Perhaps so. Let's see.

01:07:14.544 --> 01:07:15.811
Later, dude.

01:07:15.813 --> 01:07:20.150
Dude, I broke every bone
in my body.

01:07:21.319 --> 01:07:22.951
- But you know what?
- Say it, bro.

01:07:22.953 --> 01:07:25.288
I caught massive air!

01:09:02.557 --> 01:09:04.193
That's perfect.

01:09:14.136 --> 01:09:14.803
Hello?

01:09:23.912 --> 01:09:25.448
Is someone here?

01:09:39.362 --> 01:09:40.330
May we assist you, sir?

01:09:41.064 --> 01:09:42.932
Uh, I saw the sign. I...

01:09:43.867 --> 01:09:45.502
I thought this was a...
was a...

01:09:46.102 --> 01:09:47.270
I need a suit.

01:09:48.339 --> 01:09:49.805
Finest tailors in the valley.

01:09:50.907 --> 01:09:52.243
But I need it
very quickly.

01:09:53.243 --> 01:09:54.176
And I need to look very
successful,

01:09:54.178 --> 01:09:54.842
Hmm.

01:09:54.844 --> 01:09:55.913
and very rich.

01:10:03.421 --> 01:10:05.156
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:10:06.557 --> 01:10:08.826
You're Winters and Wang.

01:10:09.927 --> 01:10:11.093
Finest tailors
in the valley, sir.

01:10:11.095 --> 01:10:12.895
But... but we're
treasure hunters too.

01:10:12.897 --> 01:10:14.596
We followed
you guys' career.

01:10:14.598 --> 01:10:16.667
My partner and I,
we were right behind you.

01:10:17.402 --> 01:10:18.801
Uh, behind us, sir?

01:10:18.803 --> 01:10:20.205
On your trail.

01:10:21.039 --> 01:10:22.474
I mean, you guys found the...

01:10:23.341 --> 01:10:24.441
Treasure of Cabeza de Vaca?

01:10:24.443 --> 01:10:25.942
Yes. You found that.
And the...

01:10:25.944 --> 01:10:28.645
- Mesa of the Bulls.
- Right, you found that one as well.

01:10:28.647 --> 01:10:30.115
And also, the...

01:10:31.384 --> 01:10:33.350
- Lost Nugget Mine?
- Yes. Yes, you found that one.

01:10:33.352 --> 01:10:34.986
- And...
- The lost Dutch oven.

01:10:35.587 --> 01:10:36.489
Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:37.256 --> 01:10:38.491
You guys found them all.

01:10:41.394 --> 01:10:42.428
We found nothing, sir.

01:10:43.329 --> 01:10:45.364
But... but that's impossible.

01:10:46.132 --> 01:10:47.298
You guys are legendary.

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.300
We are but humble tailors, sir.

01:10:49.302 --> 01:10:51.936
No, no, we... we kept
all the pictures.

01:10:51.938 --> 01:10:53.574
We read all the articles.

01:10:55.074 --> 01:10:56.343
- Yeah, we were paid, sir.
- A small stipend, really.

01:10:57.411 --> 01:10:58.244
To pose for the pictures
in the desert.

01:10:59.145 --> 01:11:00.880
But... but the treasure...

01:11:01.747 --> 01:11:02.980
Yeah, not real,
I'm afraid.

01:11:02.982 --> 01:11:05.486
No, we saw the gold.
We saw the jewels.

01:11:06.086 --> 01:11:07.352
Fake, sadly.

01:11:07.354 --> 01:11:08.954
Yeah, it was Midas Master Metal
Detector's idea.

01:11:08.956 --> 01:11:11.058
- Using average men like us.
- You know, everyman.

01:11:12.159 --> 01:11:13.458
- Any man.
- They thought if they convinced

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:14.526
other people
we could find treasure...

01:11:14.528 --> 01:11:16.161
Then anybody
could find treasure. Ha!

01:11:16.163 --> 01:11:19.933
And the sales of the Midas
Master 3000 would go up, up, up.

01:11:20.535 --> 01:11:22.136
But... but...

01:11:23.304 --> 01:11:24.803
I'm just going to get
your inseam here, sir.

01:11:24.805 --> 01:11:26.439
I'll go ahead and do your neck,
that's my favorite to measure.

01:11:26.441 --> 01:11:28.574
- Arm up, please.
- Oh, wow, I'm doing his chin.

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:29.710
That's a 16.

01:11:32.147 --> 01:11:34.349
I was the first to escape.

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:37.986
I wandered many days
in the desert

01:11:39.154 --> 01:11:41.624
before finding help
from good people.

01:11:42.357 --> 01:11:43.191
And me.

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:45.960
Over time, they helped us
build a camp.

01:11:47.195 --> 01:11:49.130
Trailers and gasoline,
many miles from here.

01:11:49.998 --> 01:11:51.333
How many of you
are there?

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:52.601
Seven in all.

01:11:53.469 --> 01:11:54.570
And three watch over the camp.

01:11:55.337 --> 01:11:56.537
Why gold balloons?

01:11:56.539 --> 01:11:57.573
A signal.

01:11:59.008 --> 01:12:00.142
When the lost boy sees it
they know we're near.

01:12:01.177 --> 01:12:02.311
Will more children
fly in?

01:12:03.379 --> 01:12:06.380
Yes. Tomorrow,
next week, next month.

01:12:06.382 --> 01:12:07.551
We don't know when.

01:12:08.817 --> 01:12:11.187
El Guapo changes
the landing spot every time.

01:12:12.821 --> 01:12:14.990
So we find very few.

01:12:16.459 --> 01:12:18.261
The next lost boy could land
hundreds of miles from here.

01:12:19.563 --> 01:12:22.297
No, our only hope
of rescuing all the children

01:12:22.299 --> 01:12:24.467
is to attack
the hotel itself.

01:12:25.302 --> 01:12:26.870
If we can cross that safely,

01:12:28.071 --> 01:12:29.072
the trail becomes very rocky
and narrow.

01:12:30.474 --> 01:12:32.108
The dancing one would have to go
around that mountain range.

01:12:33.109 --> 01:12:34.645
Who's the dancing one?

01:12:35.979 --> 01:12:38.416
El Guapo's most prized
possession.

01:12:39.483 --> 01:12:41.718
They say he can follow
even the dead.

01:12:42.587 --> 01:12:43.888
He is ruthless and terrible.

01:12:44.622 --> 01:12:45.990
He has no weakness,

01:12:46.857 --> 01:12:48.159
and he cannot be defeated.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.062
If we make it to Mexico,

01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:53.498
we'll find the hotel
heavily guarded.

01:12:54.265 --> 01:12:55.132
We will need more men.

01:12:55.866 --> 01:12:56.602
Fink will help us.

01:12:57.735 --> 01:12:59.271
Your friend
isn't coming back.

01:12:59.971 --> 01:13:01.038
Sure he is.

01:13:02.274 --> 01:13:04.243
Hang on,
you don't know Fink.

01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:07.045
Your friend has the bag of cash
from the truck, yes?

01:13:07.312 --> 01:13:07.980
Yeah.

01:13:09.014 --> 01:13:11.149
Once a man has embraced
that much cash

01:13:12.551 --> 01:13:14.419
and claimed it as his own,
he cannot release it.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:15.754
That's not true.

01:13:16.623 --> 01:13:18.190
He offered to give it up.

01:13:18.924 --> 01:13:19.825
I mean, how about that?

01:13:20.892 --> 01:13:21.692
He tried to give you
all the cash

01:13:21.694 --> 01:13:22.828
so we could keep Maggie.

01:13:23.996 --> 01:13:26.332
Mr. Moses, you don't
speak Spanish, do you?

01:13:27.032 --> 01:13:29.068
Me español super bad.

01:13:30.203 --> 01:13:31.938
Your friend never
offered us the money.

01:13:33.573 --> 01:13:35.908
But I told him
what to say.

01:13:36.843 --> 01:13:37.775
He said nothing
about the cash.

01:13:37.777 --> 01:13:39.647
He only asked that we not
harm the child.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.380
But...

01:13:42.382 --> 01:13:44.817
He had no intention
of giving up that money.

01:13:45.552 --> 01:13:46.986
He gave up the child,

01:13:48.289 --> 01:13:49.556
and he had no way
of knowing we were friends.

01:13:50.424 --> 01:13:52.092
He would have given up you too.

01:13:53.594 --> 01:13:55.062
That's impossible.

01:14:00.134 --> 01:14:01.770
We should leave it.

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:04.436
No. No, we're not
leaving it.

01:14:04.438 --> 01:14:06.104
Fink, you should offload
some of the cash.

01:14:06.106 --> 01:14:07.575
You could come back
for it later.

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:09.609
No way. Everyone tries that,

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:10.312
they never find it again.

01:14:11.579 --> 01:14:12.747
Leave it!

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:14.316
Fink!

01:14:15.049 --> 01:14:16.549
Would you leave it?

01:14:16.551 --> 01:14:18.117
We're going to have
to ditch the cash.

01:14:18.119 --> 01:14:19.752
- No!
- Just dump the bag.

01:14:19.754 --> 01:14:22.057
Never!

01:14:25.827 --> 01:14:28.096
You know this to be true.

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:31.534
Get some rest.

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:33.602
We'll move again at nightfall.

01:14:34.337 --> 01:14:35.404
You'll need this.

01:15:04.434 --> 01:15:06.334
Make it happen. Ah!

01:15:06.336 --> 01:15:08.438
Make it happen.
Make...

01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:12.810
What are you looking at?

01:15:14.277 --> 01:15:16.079
Huh? What are you
looking at?

01:15:19.784 --> 01:15:20.949
There we go.

01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:22.818
That's the face
I'm looking for, baby.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:25.321
Let's go, mijo,
make it happen.

01:15:25.323 --> 01:15:28.424
Let's find my money,
find my lost boys,

01:15:28.426 --> 01:15:30.261
and make it happen.

01:17:22.445 --> 01:17:23.813
Hello?

01:17:26.749 --> 01:17:28.885
You haven't changed at all.

01:17:30.586 --> 01:17:32.088
Not at all.

01:17:32.655 --> 01:17:33.721
Sorry?

01:17:33.723 --> 01:17:35.891
Joy Lynn Fairbanks?

01:17:35.893 --> 01:17:37.525
Oh. No.

01:17:37.527 --> 01:17:38.862
Hey, Ma.

01:17:44.401 --> 01:17:45.969
Can I help you?

01:17:47.337 --> 01:17:49.873
Babe, you better
get down here.

01:17:50.607 --> 01:17:52.075
Joy? Are you... this...

01:17:52.809 --> 01:17:54.077
Do you remember me?

01:17:55.479 --> 01:17:56.313
No.

01:17:56.981 --> 01:17:57.648
From high school.

01:17:58.181 --> 01:17:58.950
No.

01:18:03.755 --> 01:18:04.787
You're not Troy Davis.

01:18:04.789 --> 01:18:06.089
No, I'm Jules Fink.

01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:08.693
I gave this to Troy,
not you.

01:18:09.827 --> 01:18:11.894
Troy threw it away.
I've kept it ever since.

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:15.331
And I want you to know that
I've become very successful.

01:18:15.333 --> 01:18:17.535
And, as you can see,

01:18:18.636 --> 01:18:19.704
very rich.

01:18:20.572 --> 01:18:21.874
And I know this is sudden,

01:18:23.008 --> 01:18:24.574
but I was wondering
if you would consider...

01:18:24.576 --> 01:18:25.978
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:18:28.146 --> 01:18:29.147
You're the kid that sang.

01:18:30.315 --> 01:18:33.184
You're the kid that sang.

01:18:33.919 --> 01:18:34.587
It's you, isn't it?

01:18:35.487 --> 01:18:36.488
Honey, you got
to see this.

01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:38.958
He sang in front
of the whole school.

01:18:42.294 --> 01:18:43.596
It was so bad.

01:18:44.196 --> 01:18:45.164
He can't sing...

01:18:46.265 --> 01:18:48.167
he can't sing...

01:18:49.201 --> 01:18:49.869
Hey, were you going
to sing again?

01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:54.040
Hey, you got to hear this.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:19:08.521 --> 01:19:10.290
Remember me?

01:19:10.891 --> 01:19:11.926
Yeah, you do.

01:19:12.392 --> 01:19:13.393
Ah.

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:15.796
Were you going to propose, huh?

01:19:17.197 --> 01:19:20.534
Yeah. Well, I think this
is a little bit small, yeah?

01:19:21.002 --> 01:19:21.769
Aww.

01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:24.805
Ah, and I see...

01:19:25.673 --> 01:19:27.740
you brought my money back, huh?

01:19:27.742 --> 01:19:29.077
Is this all my money?

01:19:30.378 --> 01:19:31.978
Wait, that feels
a little bit light, right?

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:34.750
I think that feels...
I think that feels light.

01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:36.983
So did you use
some of my money

01:19:36.985 --> 01:19:38.185
to buy that ugly su-

01:19:39.921 --> 01:19:43.392
actually, that suit's
not too bad, huh?

01:19:44.258 --> 01:19:48.864
And... what about the ring?

01:19:49.598 --> 01:19:50.730
Did you use my mon-

01:19:50.732 --> 01:19:53.136
don't lie to me,
don't lie to me.

01:19:54.302 --> 01:19:55.138
Did you use my money
to buy that ring?

01:19:55.737 --> 01:19:57.140
Did you? Yeah.

01:19:59.207 --> 01:20:01.274
And then... up, up, up.

01:20:01.276 --> 01:20:03.911
And then you have the nerve
to show up to one of my homes,

01:20:03.913 --> 01:20:05.915
and then you want to ask
one of my wife...

01:20:07.315 --> 01:20:09.083
I mean, my only wife, baby.

01:20:09.085 --> 01:20:10.753
Mwah, mwah, I love you.

01:20:11.354 --> 01:20:12.288
...to marry you?

01:20:13.756 --> 01:20:14.624
Get up.

01:20:15.358 --> 01:20:16.559
Get up. Let's go.

01:20:17.293 --> 01:20:19.629
Now, we both know

01:20:21.031 --> 01:20:22.766
that if my favorite family
wasn't here right now,

01:20:23.633 --> 01:20:24.634
you'd already be dead, yeah?

01:20:25.703 --> 01:20:27.234
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we both know you would.

01:20:27.236 --> 01:20:30.908
So, you're going to give
something a little special

01:20:31.642 --> 01:20:33.742
Yeah. Yeah.

01:20:33.744 --> 01:20:34.812
Mm-hmm.

01:20:35.279 --> 01:20:36.113
Yeah.

01:20:37.281 --> 01:20:39.249
Yeah!

01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:40.584
Go bye-bye now!

01:20:41.351 --> 01:20:42.419
Now you go bye-bye.

01:20:44.688 --> 01:20:46.457
Baby, give me that oil.

01:20:47.591 --> 01:20:49.060
The real good stuff,
for the body.

01:21:09.614 --> 01:21:12.650
You're the best
and only friend I ever had.

01:21:14.385 --> 01:21:15.855
Did you tell them?

01:21:16.889 --> 01:21:18.157
I told them.

01:21:19.892 --> 01:21:21.625
I'm supposed
to save this kid

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:23.529
and bring the handsome one
to justice.

01:21:25.397 --> 01:21:28.135
The dust is never wrong.
Don't forget it.

01:21:31.771 --> 01:21:33.439
I'd rather be you.

01:21:36.408 --> 01:21:38.612
I love you, Jules Fink!

01:21:40.446 --> 01:21:41.613
No.

01:21:41.615 --> 01:21:44.084
I'm coming, Moses.
I'm coming.

01:22:05.273 --> 01:22:07.173
Come in quietly.

01:22:07.175 --> 01:22:08.476
Someone's here.

01:25:01.323 --> 01:25:02.757
No!

01:25:21.543 --> 01:25:23.244
Aah!

01:25:45.902 --> 01:25:47.405
Come on.

01:26:48.734 --> 01:26:51.337
No, no, no, no.

01:26:53.072 --> 01:26:55.108
Moses!

01:26:55.842 --> 01:26:59.011
Moses! Where are you?

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:02.382
Where are you?

01:27:11.592 --> 01:27:14.126
Please, please help me.

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:15.062
Please.

01:27:18.165 --> 01:27:20.632
No, no. I don't care
about that anymore.

01:27:20.634 --> 01:27:22.936
I just want to find my friend.
Please.

01:28:02.845 --> 01:28:04.514
If you hurt her...

01:28:05.515 --> 01:28:06.415
Pig.

01:28:07.316 --> 01:28:08.418
I'll kill you!

01:28:09.553 --> 01:28:10.853
Varmint!

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:47.854
Hello?

01:29:50.424 --> 01:29:52.090
Hello, please answer.
Is someone there?

01:29:54.528 --> 01:29:55.329
Hello?

01:29:59.066 --> 01:29:59.734
Hello?

01:30:00.834 --> 01:30:02.369
Can someone hear me?

01:30:04.539 --> 01:30:05.372
Hello?

01:30:06.608 --> 01:30:07.742
Is someone listening?

01:30:11.045 --> 01:30:12.681
If you can hear my voice,

01:30:13.415 --> 01:30:15.383
my friend needs help.

01:30:16.117 --> 01:30:16.917
He's my best friend,

01:30:18.086 --> 01:30:20.455
and if something happens to him,
I got nothing.

01:30:21.456 --> 01:30:22.457
I got nothing.

01:30:43.112 --> 01:30:44.513
Hey, I know this song.

01:30:48.284 --> 01:30:50.453
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

01:30:51.921 --> 01:30:54.624
And if you ever get a chance
to sing, you got to do it.

01:30:55.625 --> 01:30:56.793
Promise me you're going
to do it.

01:30:58.894 --> 01:31:00.464
This is my chance.

01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:03.834
I promised. I promised.

01:31:12.710 --> 01:31:14.211
What's that?

01:31:31.929 --> 01:31:34.365
Kill him. Kill him, mijo.
Kill him.

01:31:48.146 --> 01:31:51.316
Sing, Jules Fink. Sing.

01:31:51.949 --> 01:31:52.851
You shut up.

01:31:53.786 --> 01:31:56.688
Sing. Sing. Sing. Sing.

01:31:57.456 --> 01:31:58.555

01:32:44.371 --> 01:32:46.407

01:32:47.141 --> 01:32:48.409
Sing, Jules Fink.

01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:50.244
Sing!

01:33:48.839 --> 01:33:50.105
The kids...

01:34:08.026 --> 01:34:10.562
Mijo, what's
happening right now, mijo?

01:34:11.663 --> 01:34:12.931
What's happening right now,
mijo?

01:34:13.765 --> 01:34:15.667
Come on, get up.
Let's go.

01:34:16.768 --> 01:34:18.136
Got some killing to do.
Come on, let's go.

01:34:18.736 --> 01:34:20.104
Make it happen.

01:34:20.973 --> 01:34:23.008
Let's make it happen, yeah?

01:34:23.909 --> 01:34:24.942
There we go.
That's my boy.

01:34:24.944 --> 01:34:25.911
Get up, here we go.
Wait.

01:34:26.745 --> 01:34:27.412
Wait a second,
what are you doing?

01:34:28.547 --> 01:34:29.211
No, no, no, mijo.
Come on, put me down.

01:34:29.213 --> 01:34:30.315
No, no, no, no...

01:35:14.394 --> 01:35:18.099
Bye! Bye!

Is anyone there?

01:36:04.681 --> 01:36:05.447
Hello?
