Is that barbed wire?

02:30.586 --> 02:33.087
Indeed it is, arranged
to fit like a noose.

02:33.089 --> 02:34.788
How do you wrap that
into a noose?

02:34.790 --> 02:36.623
I guess it's the same way
that porcupines make love.

02:36.625 --> 02:37.891
Very carefully.

02:37.893 --> 02:40.327
Yeah, but the tensile
strength wouldn't allow you

02:40.329 --> 02:41.628
to tie it like rope.

02:41.630 --> 02:42.796
It can if you're
strong enough,

02:42.798 --> 02:44.631
which speaks to
the unsub's physicality.

02:44.633 --> 02:46.800
And the fact that he twisted a head
completely around

02:46.802 --> 02:48.502
speaks more to the unsub's
physicality.

02:48.504 --> 02:50.938
It's a redundancy
in the M.O., isn't it?

02:50.940 --> 02:52.906
The unsub possibly
tried to hang--

02:52.908 --> 02:54.608

02:54.610 --> 02:57.044
Yeah, or decapitate
Clark Howard.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.480
The noose wasn't effective,
so he kills him by hand.

02:59.482 --> 03:01.615
Report says
he's victim number two.

03:01.617 --> 03:03.150
Who's victim number one?

03:03.152 --> 03:04.818
That would be
Matthias Lee.

03:04.820 --> 03:06.587
Mr. Lee was killed
when he was out hunting.

03:06.589 --> 03:09.256
He was caught in a bear trap.
Accident, you say?

03:09.258 --> 03:11.792
I say, no, because
the bear trap was launched

03:11.794 --> 03:14.428
from a makeshift projectile
hidden inside a tree,

03:14.430 --> 03:16.096
and it was also
lined with barbed wire,

03:16.098 --> 03:18.132
which is why Wheeling P.D.
has invited us in.

03:18.134 --> 03:20.100
Well, both victims were hunters,
but the way they were killed,

03:20.102 --> 03:21.703
it looks like the unsub
was hunting them.

03:21.704 --> 03:23.270
And even though
both men were armed

03:23.272 --> 03:24.938
and should have had
the upper hand,

03:24.940 --> 03:26.573
he was skilled enough
to use stealth

03:26.575 --> 03:28.409
and the environment
to surprise them.

03:28.411 --> 03:30.377
And in order to find this unsub,
we're gonna have to do it

03:30.379 --> 03:32.846

he's got the advantage,

Wheeling P.D. was circling Clark Howard
for the murder of Matthias Lee.

05:29.259 --> 05:31.726
It's easy to see why.
Looking at their case histories,

05:31.728 --> 05:33.806
both men filed dozens
of harassment and nuisance

05:33.831 --> 05:35.231
lawsuits against each other,

05:35.232 --> 05:37.799
including unfounded claims
of burglary and trespassing.

05:37.801 --> 05:41.303
Then, in 2011, Matthias Lee
filed a civil complaint

05:41.305 --> 05:44.306
against Clark Howard
"to kiss his ass."

05:44.308 --> 05:49.077
Clark Howard responded
with a motion to go...

05:49.079 --> 05:50.845
You can't actually do that
with the male anatomy.

05:50.847 --> 05:54.316
Ok, so maybe this isn't
one unsub, then.

05:54.318 --> 05:56.751
Maybe this is just
tit-for-tat revenge murders.

05:56.753 --> 05:59.087
Sure. Clark Howard uses
the barbed wire

05:59.089 --> 06:00.222
for murder number one,

06:00.224 --> 06:01.556
and then the unsub
gets him back

06:01.558 --> 06:03.325
by hanging him with it
for murder number two.

06:03.327 --> 06:05.126
We need to dig deep in the
family and friends, then.

06:05.128 --> 06:06.461
That's our suspect pool.

what else they might
have been involved in

06:20.544 --> 06:23.245
that could have
gotten them killed.

06:23.247 --> 06:26.815
I can't quite tell you why those
two boys hated each other,

06:26.817 --> 06:28.149
just that they did.

06:28.151 --> 06:30.252
According to one of
Matthias Lee's restraining orders,

06:30.254 --> 06:32.621
he not only wanted
Clark Howard kept 50 feet away,

06:32.623 --> 06:34.322
but the entire
Howard family.

06:34.324 --> 06:35.857
If the animosity
extends to the families,

06:35.859 --> 06:38.193
how many potential suspects
are we talking about?

06:38.195 --> 06:39.261
It could be all of them.

06:39.263 --> 06:41.696
And it could be
none of them.

And then a cousin.

06:49.473 --> 06:51.640
You know, they get
convinced that the reason

06:51.642 --> 06:54.542
they can't find work
or can't find a woman

06:54.544 --> 06:56.611
or can't get off of oxys,
'cause of that other family.

06:56.613 --> 06:58.647
So the mom and dad
of the two victims

06:58.649 --> 07:00.015
have agreed
to talk to us.

07:00.017 --> 07:03.218
Who is that?
Cissy Howard, Malachi Lee?

07:03.220 --> 07:06.488
Yes. And Cissy would only
come in on one condition.

07:06.490 --> 07:09.924
She told me if she even smelled
Malachi Lee, she would walk,

07:09.926 --> 07:12.427
and when she asked me what
that specific smell was,

07:12.429 --> 07:14.162
he said,
"dip and beard lice."

07:14.164 --> 07:17.198
Can we arrange to have them
come in separate entrances?

07:17.200 --> 07:18.600
Sure can.

07:18.602 --> 07:20.835
So we'll have Mrs. Howard
at 12:00 and Mr. Lee at 12:30.

07:20.837 --> 07:23.371
Won't that risk them
running into each other?

07:51.435 --> 07:54.302

And if they were trying
to make each other's lives miserable,

07:56.840 --> 07:58.873
they probably weren't
just making it.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.842
They were selling it.

08:00.844 --> 08:02.410

it was the same person.

08:17.828 --> 08:19.594
I'm thinking maybe
we should hold off on that.

08:19.596 --> 08:21.197
The mountain man seems
to be a confluence

08:21.198 --> 08:22.597
of several local legends.

08:22.599 --> 08:25.100
Some say he's part of the backwoods
Appalachian population,

08:25.102 --> 08:27.102
others say he's a confederate holdout
trying to start a second civil war

08:27.104 --> 08:28.603
to turn brother
against brother,

08:28.605 --> 08:30.672
but the one thing
they all could agree upon

08:30.674 --> 08:32.774
is if you go into
a darkened bathroom

08:32.775 --> 08:35.076
and you chant "I hate
the mountain man" 3 times,

08:35.078 --> 08:36.865
he'll pop up and kill you

08:36.890 --> 08:38.892
the next time you hear
Lynyrd Skynyrd on the radio.

08:39.683 --> 08:42.683
So you're sure the theft from
the farms match the crime scenes?

08:42.686 --> 08:44.119
Yeah. Barbed wire's actually
quite specific

08:44.121 --> 08:45.954
depending on what type
of livestock you're trying to keep in

08:45.956 --> 08:47.756
and what type of rustlers
you're trying to keep out.

08:47.758 --> 08:50.959
In this case, the concertina
formation was exactly what was used

08:50.961 --> 08:52.727
to kill Clark Howard
and Matthias Lee.

08:52.729 --> 08:55.830

12:42.025 --> 12:45.226
The new underground market brought
back old rivalries to the surface.

12:45.228 --> 12:48.663
It's only a matter of time before
the Howards attack the Lees again.

12:48.665 --> 12:51.099
I mean, they were basically
announcing it to us in the elevator.

12:51.101 --> 12:53.134
We've got to find a way
to defuse the situation

12:53.136 --> 12:55.536
or these families will
tear each other apart.

12:56.505 --> 12:58.206
That's excellent.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.642
That is excellent.

13:00.644 --> 13:02.510
And on behalf of my father,
I want to thank you

13:02.512 --> 13:04.312
for doing business with us.

13:04.314 --> 13:05.446
[Laughing]

13:05.448 --> 13:07.915
Well, I know you have
your choices for product

13:07.917 --> 13:10.351
in the Wheeling area,
so the fact that you're favoring us--

13:10.353 --> 13:11.686
[engine starting,

13:11.688 --> 13:12.687
Maddie!

13:12.689 --> 13:16.724

13:23.066 --> 13:25.633
Oh, please! [Sobbing]

13:25.635 --> 13:27.935
Oh, please! Oh, God!

13:27.937 --> 13:31.906
[Sobbing, screaming]

13:38.280 --> 13:39.947
Aah!

13:39.949 --> 13:41.382
No!

13:54.804 --> 13:56.882
Why aren't you people
stopping this?

13:56.883 --> 13:57.915
We're trying to, but--

13:57.917 --> 14:00.651
But what?!
They killed my wife!

14:00.653 --> 14:02.987
Ok. It's all right.

14:02.989 --> 14:05.656
You know, it's obviously
the Howards that are doing this.

14:05.658 --> 14:07.324
Why? What's going on
between the two families?

14:07.326 --> 14:09.226
That's none of your
damn business.

14:09.228 --> 14:11.061
It is now.

14:13.164 --> 14:14.732
Is it crystal meth?

14:14.734 --> 14:17.534
Ohh. I see. Of course.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.715
So we're just a bunch of
dumb West Virginia hicks.

14:21.717 --> 14:23.350
We must be cooking meth.

14:23.352 --> 14:25.185
I tell you what.
You search my house

14:25.187 --> 14:26.653
and you search
my bank account

14:26.655 --> 14:29.556
and you come back
and tell me that I'm dealing drugs.

14:31.159 --> 14:34.027
I thought you were
smarter than that.

14:36.898 --> 14:39.299
JJ...

14:39.301 --> 14:40.367
Bad?

14:40.369 --> 14:42.536
Yeah.
Head taken clean off.

14:42.538 --> 14:44.604
And we found the third piece
of barbed wire

14:44.606 --> 14:45.572
that Reid reported stolen.

14:45.574 --> 14:46.907
It doesn't mean
this is over.

14:46.909 --> 14:49.576
We profiled a series
of retaliatory attacks.

14:49.578 --> 14:53.346
Right now it's Howards two,
Lees, one.

14:54.348 --> 14:55.682
Hotch.

14:58.686 --> 15:00.287
Mrs. Howard.

15:00.289 --> 15:03.924
Heard through the grapevine
you're looking for an old Monte Carlo.

15:03.926 --> 15:05.826
You know someone
who drives a car like that?

15:05.828 --> 15:07.894
I know someone who don't.

15:07.896 --> 15:11.631
Here's a copy of every vehicle registered
in the Howard family name.

15:11.633 --> 15:13.900
That's all well and good,
Mrs. Howard,

15:13.902 --> 15:16.470
but when someone's
this eager to prove their innocence,

15:16.472 --> 15:17.804
it makes us wonder.

15:17.806 --> 15:19.239
Well, it's true enough.

15:19.241 --> 15:21.641
There's no love lost between
the Howards and the Lees.

15:21.643 --> 15:23.706
But we would never hurt
a woman who did nothing

15:23.731 --> 15:26.579
but raising her babies.

15:27.282 --> 15:29.549
We didn't do this,
agent Hotchner.

15:29.551 --> 15:31.485
You'll see.

15:33.454 --> 15:36.156
My men are all here.
We're ready for your profile.

15:36.158 --> 15:39.292
We need a little more time.

16:15.730 --> 16:19.599
[Sobbing] Oh, mama.

16:19.601 --> 16:22.602
Mama...Help...

16:22.604 --> 16:25.405
Ok, if we hit the reset
button on the profile,

16:25.407 --> 16:26.573
what do we have?

16:26.575 --> 16:28.241
Well, the behavior
points to one obvious theory.

16:28.243 --> 16:30.510
Revenge murders stoking
the fire of a family feud.

16:30.512 --> 16:32.145
With the forensic evidence
to back it up.

16:32.147 --> 16:34.581
Physical evidence
of methamphetamine production.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.283
The only problem is every time
we dig a little deeper

16:36.285 --> 16:38.552
into the families,
that theory falls apart.

16:38.554 --> 16:40.287
The Howards are certainly
doing everything they can

16:40.289 --> 16:41.988
to prove this isn't
about revenge for them.

16:41.990 --> 16:43.957
But the unsub want the families
to think that it is.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.793
What if it's an outsider like you
would see in the drug cartel model?

16:46.795 --> 16:48.862
One supplier eliminates
two major competitors

16:48.864 --> 16:50.931
by getting them
to fight with each other.

16:50.933 --> 16:52.766
Except what are they
fighting over?

16:52.768 --> 16:55.735
Miles Lee made a good point
when I questioned him.

16:55.737 --> 16:57.180
There is nothing in his home
or bank account

16:57.205 --> 16:59.073
to indicate he was a dealer.

16:59.074 --> 17:00.240
Garcia: Ready, ready.

17:00.242 --> 17:02.542
So Garcia and I
dug a little deeper. Take it away.

17:02.544 --> 17:03.563
I did some peeking

17:03.588 --> 17:06.691
into both the Lee and Howard
online shopping activity.

17:07.049 --> 17:09.415
Here's what I found.
In addition to lye,

17:09.417 --> 17:10.916
they bought--are you ready?

17:10.919 --> 17:12.685
Sodium hydroxide,
methanol,

17:12.688 --> 17:14.854
mixing beakers,
digital scales,

17:14.856 --> 17:16.455
safety glasses,
gloves, aprons--

17:16.458 --> 17:17.891
All of which
you need for meth.

17:17.893 --> 17:21.728
But the arrest record in the community
told a different story.

17:21.730 --> 17:24.731
Neither the Howards nor the Lees
are even tangentially involved.

17:24.733 --> 17:26.233
Garcia, where were
the purchases shipped?

17:26.234 --> 17:28.201
Uh, the Howards
spread them out.

17:28.203 --> 17:31.605
The other side just sent them
to one address, Malachi Lee's farm.

17:31.607 --> 17:34.441
We don't have a profile until we know
what the family business is.

17:34.443 --> 17:36.009
Let's go get some answers.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.477
Thanks, Garcia.

17:43.584 --> 17:46.453

17:50.491 --> 17:51.825
Show me your hands!
Don't shoot!

17:51.827 --> 17:54.794
Show me your hands!
Don't shoot!

17:54.796 --> 17:58.098
On your knees! Now!

17:59.033 --> 18:02.302
Don't shoot. You gonna
blow us all sky high.

18:02.304 --> 18:05.005
We comin' out.
Put down the weapons.

18:05.007 --> 18:06.373
Put 'em down!

18:06.375 --> 18:07.774
I'm the one who opened
fire, not my kids.

18:07.776 --> 18:09.309
You didn't say
who you were.

18:09.311 --> 18:10.577
We thought
you was the Howards.

18:10.579 --> 18:11.945
We're FBI. How's that?

18:11.947 --> 18:14.781
It's still private property.
You're trespassin'.

18:14.783 --> 18:17.250
You need a warrant.
You can't go in there.

18:17.252 --> 18:19.252
Couldn't agree with you more.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.602
There's no ventilation.

18:35.604 --> 18:36.936
If they were cooking
meth in here,

18:36.938 --> 18:38.438
they'd all be dead
from the fumes.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.473
So what exactly
are they cooking?

18:40.475 --> 18:42.175
It smells like cooking oil.

18:45.012 --> 18:48.181
More like used cooking oil.

18:48.983 --> 18:50.617
Waste runoff collected
by restaurants

18:50.619 --> 18:53.987
and just thrown out
like garbage.

18:54.955 --> 18:56.923
I think I might know
what they're up to.

18:56.925 --> 18:59.225
I started reading
about biofuel,

18:59.227 --> 19:02.062
where you take a clean-burning
waste product like used cooking oil

19:02.064 --> 19:04.030
and you turn it into
an ethanol gas.

19:04.032 --> 19:05.832
I know the conversion
method's similar to meth.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.767
Yeah, but,
only this stuff is legal.

19:07.769 --> 19:10.837
And believe it or not,
it's way more profitable.

19:10.839 --> 19:12.405
Dave, wait!

19:16.777 --> 19:19.279
Why didn't you tell us
this is what you were selling?

19:19.281 --> 19:22.315
'Cause if the outsiders knew
how much money we were making,

19:22.317 --> 19:24.651
we'd become targets.

19:24.653 --> 19:26.986
You already are.

19:53.013 --> 19:54.981
Guys, I'm a little worried
I wasted my time

19:54.983 --> 19:56.416
being an expert in my field,

19:56.418 --> 19:58.952
because this biofuel thing
has a massive payout.

19:58.954 --> 20:01.421
How much money
are we talking about?

20:01.423 --> 20:04.324
We're talking in the hundreds
of millions of dollars.

20:04.326 --> 20:07.394
So, it turns out
the Lee and Howard families

20:07.396 --> 20:08.928
took all of their old moonshine

20:08.930 --> 20:10.930
and other suspicious
manufacturing infrastructure

20:10.932 --> 20:13.500
to create highly efficient
conversion methods.

20:13.502 --> 20:15.168
Only now they're both
in the process of selling them.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.169
To whom?

20:16.171 --> 20:17.504
To a West Virginia company

20:17.506 --> 20:20.079
that wants total control
of the biofuel market in the state.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.446
Well, if our profile
is right,

20:21.448 --> 20:23.181
someone didn't want
to deal to go through.

20:23.183 --> 20:25.917
Maybe the sellers are sabotaging it
to drive down the price.

20:25.919 --> 20:28.620
Yeah, but there are easier ways
to do that than resorting to murder.

20:28.622 --> 20:30.088
Someone in the community, then?

20:30.090 --> 20:32.958
Malachi kept it a secret because
he didn't want outsiders to know.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.659
The Howards would behave
with the same self-interest.

20:34.661 --> 20:36.094
Only family members
would know.

20:36.096 --> 20:38.797
It doesn't make sense.
If the unsub's a family member,

20:38.799 --> 20:41.133
he's blowing his
one big chance to get rich.

20:41.135 --> 20:43.068
Unless he were frozen
out of the deal.

20:43.070 --> 20:46.304
Garcia, run the names on the
contracts against both family trees.

20:46.306 --> 20:47.672
Done.
Anybody excluded?

20:47.674 --> 20:50.675
There's a distant cousin
on the Howard side--

20:50.677 --> 20:51.843
Caleb. Black sheep.

20:51.845 --> 20:54.312
In and out of jail
for larceny.

20:54.314 --> 20:55.881
Stealing from farms,
specifically.

20:55.883 --> 20:57.048
Where is he now?

20:57.050 --> 20:58.216
No known address.

20:58.218 --> 20:59.951
It's a good bet Cissy knows.

20:59.953 --> 21:01.219
We should pay her a visit.

21:01.221 --> 21:03.054
Well, before you do,
you should know that Caleb

21:03.056 --> 21:04.445
is on an FBI watchlist.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.592
Apparently, he was part of
an underground organization

21:06.593 --> 21:09.161
that wanted the, quote,

21:09.163 --> 21:11.897
"real south to secede
from the false south."

21:17.571 --> 21:20.438
The legend Reid heard
from the farmers.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.308
According to them, he was part of
the Appalachian population

21:23.310 --> 21:25.076
and he wanted to start
a second civil war.

21:25.078 --> 21:28.914
They were describing
the unsub and we didn't realize it.

21:28.916 --> 21:32.217
I believe in the God
of mercy,

21:32.219 --> 21:34.886
in the God of compassion.

21:36.689 --> 21:41.193
But that's not
the God I need right now.

21:41.195 --> 21:44.396

to the God of Vengeance.

the unsub must
have come for her.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.634
He's never kidnapped
a victim before.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.570
Why didn't he kill her
on the spot?

23:08.572 --> 23:11.105
Especially considering
she pulled the trigger.

23:11.107 --> 23:13.102
This wasn't a surprise
like the previous murder.

23:13.127 --> 23:14.076
She was ready for him.

23:14.077 --> 23:15.910
It didn't do any good.
He still took her.

just under a different name.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.234
You're more than welcome
to run the record if you'd like.

25:20.236 --> 25:23.237
I'm more curious why you
go by Sam Caplan now.

25:23.239 --> 25:25.873
Well, when I was younger,
one of the reasons

25:25.875 --> 25:27.775
I would rob a farm
or get drunk

25:27.777 --> 25:29.544
or join one of those
stupid causes

25:29.546 --> 25:32.280
was because I thought
that's just what Howards did, you know?

25:32.282 --> 25:35.216
You raise hell
and ask questions later.

25:35.218 --> 25:38.353
I think it was because
I didn't like myself very much.

25:38.355 --> 25:41.589
You don't have to change
your name for a fresh start.

25:41.591 --> 25:43.091
In this town, you do.

25:43.093 --> 25:46.694
In this town, family
is--is destiny, and,

25:46.696 --> 25:48.229
well, I was embarrassed
by mine.

25:48.231 --> 25:50.999
This whole time, my team thought
you were disowned by your family,

25:51.001 --> 25:53.134
but I guess it was
the other way around.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.502
Yes, ma'am, that's right.

25:54.504 --> 25:56.437
Uh, one more thing.

25:56.439 --> 25:58.773
We're trying to find
your aunt Cissy.

25:58.775 --> 26:00.908
Do you have any idea
where she might be?

26:00.910 --> 26:02.110
None.

26:02.112 --> 26:04.379
Do you remember the last time
you talked to her?

26:04.381 --> 26:05.880
Yeah. Right before
I took her advice

26:05.882 --> 26:08.016
and signed the papers
to become Sam Caplan.

26:08.018 --> 26:10.885
She made the suggestion.

26:10.887 --> 26:13.688
Cissy Howard married
into the Howard family, right?

26:13.690 --> 26:16.224
But what was it that she said
to Malachi in the elevators?

26:16.226 --> 26:19.160
You visit your daddy's
grave recently?

26:21.096 --> 26:22.397
You visit yours?

26:22.399 --> 26:24.599
We thought that was in
reference to the family feud.

26:24.601 --> 26:26.934
But she wasn't born
into the family or their feud.

26:26.936 --> 26:30.438
Exactly. And Garcia couldn't
find any documentation for this woman.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.540
She invented herself
40 years ago.

26:32.542 --> 26:36.744
Now, add in that she gave
her nephew the idea to change his name,

26:36.746 --> 26:39.914
and her middle name
is Magdalene...

26:41.583 --> 26:44.952
Magdalene Lee,
Malachi's sister.

26:44.954 --> 26:47.088
Went missing almost
50 years ago, presumed dead.

26:47.090 --> 26:50.224
Now it all makes sense.
"You visit your daddy's grave recently?"

26:50.226 --> 26:51.726
"You visit yours?"

26:51.728 --> 26:54.195
It's the same dad.

26:54.197 --> 26:56.564
That woman raised me
from a baby.

26:56.566 --> 26:59.033
She fed me,

26:59.035 --> 27:02.070
she clothed me,
she taught me how to hunt.

27:02.072 --> 27:04.572
She's real lovely.

27:04.574 --> 27:07.942
Yeah, she was smart.

27:07.944 --> 27:10.211
She kept me away
from other people

27:10.213 --> 27:14.382
'cause she knew
they wouldn't understand.

27:17.086 --> 27:20.722
Then I started asking questions.

27:20.724 --> 27:23.658
How come I don't look
like the others, mama?

27:26.895 --> 27:30.264
How come I don't look like you?

27:35.404 --> 27:41.109
And while her body was wasting
away from the cancer...

27:41.111 --> 27:44.278
She told me...

27:44.280 --> 27:47.515
About a deal she made.

27:48.751 --> 27:52.120
About a deal she made
out here in these woods.

27:52.122 --> 27:54.922
You?

27:54.924 --> 27:57.625
Yeah.

28:03.699 --> 28:09.504
Now, I'm going to decide
whether you live

28:09.506 --> 28:11.572
or die.

28:11.574 --> 28:14.809
But that depends
on how much you confess.

28:14.811 --> 28:17.044
What it must have been like
to see your sister

28:17.046 --> 28:20.581
in the elevator after all this time.
What's it been, 50 years?

28:20.583 --> 28:22.550
And you never
ran into her in town?

28:22.552 --> 28:24.152
No, I did not.

28:24.154 --> 28:26.320
Once she run off,
she was dead in my folks' eyes.

28:26.322 --> 28:28.990
Why'd she leave?
Or was she forced out?

28:28.992 --> 28:31.659
Well, I don't think
that's really your business.

28:31.661 --> 28:33.594
No, but it is my business,

28:33.596 --> 28:34.862
when your children
are dying

28:34.864 --> 28:37.231
and I seem to care
more about stopping it than you do.

28:37.233 --> 28:40.034
You don't tell me
that you care more

28:40.036 --> 28:44.405
about my kids than I do,
you understand that?

28:44.407 --> 28:47.642
I just lost my son.

28:47.644 --> 28:50.778
Then help me.

28:50.780 --> 28:53.548
Why did she leave?

28:53.550 --> 28:57.418
She got in a family way.

28:57.420 --> 28:59.487
She shamed my folks.

28:59.489 --> 29:01.322
How old was she?

29:01.324 --> 29:03.991
She was 16.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.596
But girls in your family
have conceived younger.

29:05.621 --> 29:07.103
Why was it shameful?

29:17.573 --> 29:20.875
It was your child.

29:24.813 --> 29:26.914
Wasn't it?

29:26.916 --> 29:29.417
I didn't--

29:29.419 --> 29:32.553
I didn't force her
or nothin'.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.594
We was kids.

29:39.596 --> 29:41.262
She loved me.

29:41.264 --> 29:44.332
And I loved her.

29:44.334 --> 29:47.535
Anybody else
in the family know?

29:47.537 --> 29:50.771
No.

29:50.773 --> 29:54.075
What happened
to the child?

29:57.946 --> 30:00.081
[Sighs]

30:01.416 --> 30:04.852
There was this shack.

30:04.854 --> 30:08.089
We used to go there when...

30:08.091 --> 30:09.957
We wanted to sin.

30:09.959 --> 30:11.759
Am I right?

30:14.129 --> 30:17.932
And this is the place.

30:17.934 --> 30:20.835
This is where
I was conceived?

30:20.837 --> 30:23.771
Yeah. That's right.

30:23.773 --> 30:27.108
Thought nobody's
catch you, didn't you?

30:29.411 --> 30:31.279
My mama did.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.986
You liked her
looking at you.

30:42.457 --> 30:44.492
You liked it,
didn't you, whore?

30:46.328 --> 30:48.129
But she knew.

30:48.131 --> 30:49.964
You can't cheat
the laws of God

30:49.966 --> 30:51.766
and the laws of nature
forever.

30:51.768 --> 30:54.468
When did you know
about me?

30:54.470 --> 30:58.139
What if we tell
mama and daddy?

30:58.141 --> 31:01.642
They'll kill us.

31:01.644 --> 31:03.077
They'll kill us both.

31:03.079 --> 31:05.813
Adult Cissy: You gotta
understand, we were young.

31:05.815 --> 31:08.883
So we come up
with a plan.

31:08.885 --> 31:11.652
It wasn't a good plan.

31:11.654 --> 31:14.522
But it was the best
two teenagers could do.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.357
You'd keep the baby.

31:16.359 --> 31:18.793
Yeah.

31:18.795 --> 31:21.562
Oh, my God!

31:21.564 --> 31:24.465
It hurts so bad!

31:24.467 --> 31:26.467
Am I dying?

31:26.469 --> 31:27.535
Ohh...

31:27.537 --> 31:29.337
Something's wrong.

31:29.339 --> 31:30.338
[Sobbing]

31:30.340 --> 31:32.340
I can't stay here
for this.

31:32.342 --> 31:34.208
Where are you going?!

31:34.210 --> 31:37.345
Malachi! Come back here!

31:38.647 --> 31:41.248
[Groaning]

31:41.250 --> 31:43.084
[Sound of crying fading]

31:43.086 --> 31:44.919
And you ran.

31:44.921 --> 31:48.255
Yes, I did.

31:48.257 --> 31:51.325
I ran.

31:51.327 --> 31:53.828
I ran like a coward.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.497
Please...

31:56.499 --> 31:58.766
Help me.

31:58.768 --> 32:01.202
Someone help me.

32:01.204 --> 32:04.005
Oh, God.

32:04.007 --> 32:06.374
Oh, God...

32:13.115 --> 32:14.849
You.

32:14.851 --> 32:16.584
I had no money.

32:16.586 --> 32:19.120
I had no resources.

32:19.122 --> 32:22.023
I wasn't ready
to be a mother.

32:22.025 --> 32:24.191
But she was.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.060
So she said
she'd help me.

32:26.062 --> 32:28.729
[Screaming]
We made a deal.

32:28.731 --> 32:30.865
She'd keep my secret...

32:30.867 --> 32:32.767
[Screaming]

32:32.769 --> 32:36.637
[Baby crying]

32:36.639 --> 32:39.807
And she got to keep him.

32:39.809 --> 32:45.780
After I gave you up,
I rambled the state for 2, 3 years.

32:45.782 --> 32:49.383
Then I heard one of the Howard
boys was looking for a wife.

32:49.385 --> 32:52.586
So I put myself
where he could see me.

32:52.588 --> 32:56.357
I never told him what I'd done,
where I'd come from.

32:56.359 --> 32:58.859
Once he made a decent
woman out of me,

32:58.861 --> 33:03.597
I prayed to God
for a fresh start.

33:03.599 --> 33:05.099
And he gave it to me.

33:05.101 --> 33:06.133
No!

33:06.135 --> 33:08.302
No, no,

33:08.304 --> 33:09.770
no!

33:11.139 --> 33:13.474
We ain't done with me yet.

33:14.443 --> 33:16.777
On the night I was born...

33:19.247 --> 33:22.083
Did you name me?

33:24.052 --> 33:26.087
No.

33:27.289 --> 33:30.024
Did you kiss me good-bye?

33:31.393 --> 33:33.494
No.

33:41.803 --> 33:44.805
Did you even hold me?

33:48.710 --> 33:51.178
Did you?!

33:53.882 --> 33:55.683
Yes.

33:58.186 --> 34:02.790
[Baby cooing]

34:02.792 --> 34:05.893
Please...

34:05.895 --> 34:08.829
Just let me look at him.

34:16.103 --> 34:18.438
Oh...

34:18.440 --> 34:20.373
My...

34:21.743 --> 34:24.911
Oh--my sweet Jesus, he's--

34:24.914 --> 34:26.647
[baby crying]

34:26.649 --> 34:28.616
He's...

34:29.751 --> 34:33.087
What's wrong with him?

34:39.127 --> 34:40.661
He's perfect.

34:40.663 --> 34:43.397
[Baby crying]

34:50.472 --> 34:53.541
You never even
thought about me, did you?

34:55.310 --> 34:57.745
I tried not to.

34:57.747 --> 35:00.481
But I knew.

35:00.483 --> 35:05.219
I knew I would pay before my maker
for what I'd done.

35:15.597 --> 35:17.965
You were right.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.103
No!

35:23.105 --> 35:25.873
You said if I told you
the truth--

35:25.875 --> 35:28.142
I said I'd decide.

35:29.578 --> 35:31.612
And I have.

35:36.184 --> 35:40.387
I'm gonna send you
to hell myself.

35:48.013 --> 35:50.424
The shack Malachi described
fits the geographic profile

35:50.425 --> 35:51.991
of the unsub's hunting zone.

35:51.993 --> 35:54.026
What are we walking into?
We've already been shot at

35:54.028 --> 35:55.128
by the locals once.

35:55.130 --> 35:57.997
According to Garcia, the
census counter out there

35:57.999 --> 35:59.632
encountered an Appalachian
woman living in a cabin,

35:59.634 --> 36:01.334
but she refused to give
any information.

36:01.336 --> 36:03.736
The woman must have raised
the unsub out there.

36:03.738 --> 36:06.139
That's how he knows the area so well.
It's his backyard.

36:06.141 --> 36:08.641
That's exactly where he would
have taken Cissy.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.983
Wait. Wait...

36:16.985 --> 36:18.284
For what?

36:18.286 --> 36:21.454
You kill me here,
they'll find you.

36:21.456 --> 36:24.957
They'll know
everything you did.

36:24.959 --> 36:27.160
Why would you help me?

36:27.162 --> 36:31.264
'Cause I need to pay
for my sins.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.468
But I want you to live.

37:02.162 --> 37:03.763
Uhh!

37:03.765 --> 37:05.832
Man down! Man down!
Fall back!

37:05.834 --> 37:07.300
Fall back!

37:07.302 --> 37:10.336
[Dog barking]

37:10.338 --> 37:12.772
Bloodhound has the scent.

37:12.774 --> 37:15.575
Ok. We gotta split up.
We can cover more ground. Let's go.

37:34.728 --> 37:36.028
I have eyes on Cissy.

37:36.030 --> 37:37.864
He's got her
rigged to a tree.

37:37.866 --> 37:39.599
Morgan: Do not approach.
She could be bait.

37:39.601 --> 37:41.334
I'm on my way.

37:54.515 --> 37:56.182
Blake!

37:56.184 --> 37:58.284
Blake!

38:00.120 --> 38:01.621
Blake?!

38:01.623 --> 38:02.622
Blake!

38:02.624 --> 38:03.689
Blake, can you hear me?!

38:03.691 --> 38:06.058
Blake!

38:10.831 --> 38:11.998
Blake!

38:12.000 --> 38:14.967
[Gasping]

38:16.503 --> 38:18.404
Start shooting!
Start shooting!

38:18.406 --> 38:19.405
Where?!

38:19.407 --> 38:20.740
Everywhere!

38:30.851 --> 38:33.452
Where's the body?

38:33.454 --> 38:36.556
Where is he?

38:39.459 --> 38:42.028
This is SSA Rossi
with the BAU.

38:42.030 --> 38:44.297
We need to drag the lake.

38:57.077 --> 38:58.444
[Sighs]

38:58.446 --> 39:00.346
How you doing?

39:00.348 --> 39:02.582
My hair smells like
a dirty sock.

39:02.584 --> 39:06.852
But...other than that
I'm fine.

39:06.854 --> 39:08.888
Ok.

39:08.890 --> 39:11.390
How are you doing?

39:14.127 --> 39:17.330
I just--I couldn't breathe.

39:18.932 --> 39:21.367
We put 30 bullets
into that water.

39:21.369 --> 39:23.903
Ok.

39:23.905 --> 39:25.905
He's dead, Alex.

39:25.907 --> 39:29.175
He's dead.

39:30.277 --> 39:32.945
We can still press charges
against Malachi Lee.

39:32.947 --> 39:34.814
He opened fire
on federal agents.

39:34.816 --> 39:37.950
My humble opinion--
it's a waste of time.

39:37.952 --> 39:40.052
A jury of his peers
don't take kindly

39:40.054 --> 39:42.989
to government attacks
on their homes.

39:48.962 --> 39:50.429
You talk to the families?

39:50.431 --> 39:54.600
We explained how Malachi was
instrumental in the recovery of Cissy.

39:54.602 --> 39:58.871
Only that just raised more uncomfortable
questions than we could answer.

39:58.873 --> 40:02.074
I would not want to be
that poor son of a gun

40:02.076 --> 40:04.143
for all the money
in the world.

40:29.670 --> 40:32.438
Magdalene...

40:37.344 --> 40:40.546
It should have been me
he killed.

40:45.152 --> 40:48.220
It should have been
us both.

40:55.195 --> 40:57.596
[Elevator door opens]

41:22.222 --> 41:25.791
Something you two
want to tell us?

41:36.603 --> 41:38.170
Where did you find
this place?

41:38.172 --> 41:39.772
Well, believe it or not,

41:39.774 --> 41:42.675
my parents used to bring us here
when we were kids.

41:42.677 --> 41:44.877
Your parents?
They brought you here?

41:44.879 --> 41:46.512
Yeah.

41:46.514 --> 41:49.882
This place is certainly
out of the way.

41:49.884 --> 41:51.484
You are gonna love it.

41:51.486 --> 41:54.086
No one is gonna bother us.

41:54.088 --> 41:57.156
No phones. No Internet.

41:57.158 --> 42:00.192
No dry cleaning,
no takeout.

42:00.194 --> 42:02.862
No calls from your boss.

42:03.864 --> 42:06.031
Good point.

42:12.105 --> 42:13.839
You need to wait.

42:13.841 --> 42:17.309
Oh, no, no, no.
Come on.

42:17.311 --> 42:20.846
Oh, this is worth
waiting for.

42:20.848 --> 42:23.382
[Laughs]

42:44.404 --> 42:47.706
[Indistinct sound]

42:51.144 --> 42:52.945
Sandy?

42:56.149 --> 42:57.183
Sandy.

42:57.185 --> 42:59.685
[Water running]

43:02.656 --> 43:04.590
Sandy?

43:14.167 --> 43:15.734
[Faucet squeaks]

43:17.904 --> 43:19.672
Aah!
Aah!

43:19.674 --> 43:21.707
Oh, my God.

43:21.709 --> 43:23.275
What is wrong with you?

43:23.277 --> 43:24.728
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

43:24.753 --> 43:25.579
What are you doing?

43:25.580 --> 43:28.013
You're so sexy
when you're scared.

43:28.015 --> 43:31.584
Well, uh, you're sexy
when you--

43:31.586 --> 43:34.653
[screaming]

43:34.655 --> 43:39.391
You have 3 seconds
to give me the keys to your car.

43:39.393 --> 43:41.026
3...

43:41.028 --> 43:42.862
2...

43:42.864 --> 43:44.163
