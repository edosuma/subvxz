01:39.583 --> 01:40.583
So?

01:41.625 --> 01:42.458
What?

01:42.541 --> 01:43.583
What did you see?

01:46.416 --> 01:47.333
A chubby one.

01:49.583 --> 01:50.583
And dark skinned.

01:53.041 --> 01:53.916
Dark skinned?

01:56.500 --> 01:58.083
So he was yours.

01:58.416 --> 01:59.250
Dark skin.

02:00.166 --> 02:01.000
Yes.

02:23.208 --> 02:24.541
Were my tits big?

02:27.500 --> 02:28.333
Huge.

02:36.083 --> 02:37.250
You saw the father?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.166
No. I didn't see him.

02:48.166 --> 02:49.541
What're we going to do?

02:52.083 --> 02:53.333
We'll figure it out.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.000
Come here.

02:59.416 --> 03:00.250
Come on.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.250
-Stop.
-What?

03:10.458 --> 03:11.583
Let's play again.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.333
All right.

03:20.083 --> 03:20.916
One.

03:21.791 --> 03:22.625
Two.

03:23.291 --> 03:24.291
Three.

06:01.958 --> 06:03.208
Ma'am?

06:10.791 --> 06:15.250
BASED ON THE PLAY
"The Wind in a Violin"

06:19.041 --> 06:21.208
Darío, get up, hurry.

06:30.708 --> 06:31.916
Ma'am, get up.

06:32.875 --> 06:33.708
Nora?

06:33.958 --> 06:34.791
Yes.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.208
What time is it?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.750
It's 9:15, ma'am.
The alarm's gone off.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
This piece of trash didn't go off!

06:47.916 --> 06:49.041
Goddamn it!

06:49.791 --> 06:51.875
-Hand me the phone.
-Yes.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.333
-Here. There it is.
-I can't see a thing.

06:57.916 --> 06:59.125
Here. Find Esteban.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.250
There are many that say "Esteban."

07:08.000 --> 07:09.250
Check on "Logistics."

07:10.125 --> 07:11.458
Esteban, Logistics.

07:11.541 --> 07:12.541
"Logistics."

07:19.125 --> 07:20.916
Darío is asleep.

07:22.791 --> 07:23.708
Hello, Esteban?

07:24.375 --> 07:26.500
One moment... One moment,
one moment.

07:26.666 --> 07:28.875
Wake him. He has class
and can't skip it.

07:28.958 --> 07:29.791
I'll wake him.

07:30.041 --> 07:31.583
And he has therapy later.

07:31.666 --> 07:34.791
Sorry. No, I've got a bad signal.

07:36.750 --> 07:40.625
No. I'm running late
at the faculty, with Darío.

07:41.541 --> 07:44.250
No, he fought with a teacher.
He's on edge.

07:44.916 --> 07:48.541
I'm currently in a meeting
with the head of the program.

07:50.166 --> 07:53.416
Still, everything's in the e-mail
I sent you last night.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.916
I sent it to you last night.

07:56.791 --> 07:58.208
That doesn't make sense.

07:59.875 --> 08:02.375
No, no, no!
You know what I need, Esteban? Explain.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.083
You understand?

08:04.541 --> 08:05.708
Say I didn't skip it.

08:06.291 --> 08:07.833
Exactly!

08:08.583 --> 08:10.125
Can you explain to them?

08:11.208 --> 08:12.250
You'll try?

08:12.750 --> 08:14.958
Okay. So, you'll try.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.333
Fantastic!

08:16.791 --> 08:20.041
Tell me something, Esteban,
why don't you try and go to hell as well?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.166
Son of a bitch!

08:25.375 --> 08:27.125
He says he'll try, he'll try.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.250
Thanks.

09:56.875 --> 09:57.791
Who is it?

09:58.666 --> 10:00.250
Hey, Santiago. It's Darío.

10:00.750 --> 10:01.583
Come on in.

10:07.916 --> 10:12.041
Yes, yes, yes. I'm calm.
I'm focusing on my projects.

10:14.208 --> 10:16.291
-Do you still smoke?
-Pot?

10:16.875 --> 10:20.458
As usual, very little. Thing is,
the weed dried out, so...

10:20.541 --> 10:22.916
I don't have pot left.
Don't have any.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.291
Everything's coming together, right?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.791
You have a job,
the weeds dried out...

10:32.333 --> 10:33.375
All's better with Mom.

10:34.916 --> 10:38.333
We just began yet you're already
talking about your mother.

10:39.250 --> 10:42.875
This is therapy, isn't it?
It's normal to talk about mothers.

10:43.208 --> 10:44.041
Yeah?

10:44.958 --> 10:46.208
So, you're an expert?

10:47.291 --> 10:48.125
Just a bit.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.833
I always repeat myself.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.250
And so do you.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.666
I like the job you're doing.

10:56.750 --> 10:57.625
I like it.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.708
But I find it unfair having to pay you

11:00.791 --> 11:03.083
when we're almost
on the same intellectual level.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.666
Santiago, I...

11:08.000 --> 11:10.541
I want you to feel comfortable
with me,

11:10.625 --> 11:12.708
in case you need help
with patients.

11:14.208 --> 11:15.333
I've been thinking.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.416
We can get together at a bar.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.750
And I can share my advice

11:20.833 --> 11:23.541
with the toughest cases, especially.
Yeah?

11:24.125 --> 11:26.375
Or you can record the session

11:26.458 --> 11:28.833
on your phone
so we can hear it together.

11:28.916 --> 11:30.041
Don't forget,

11:30.125 --> 11:32.208
we have to think of the patient.

11:33.583 --> 11:37.500
Think of his needs. You get me?
We can't both go on like this.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.583
You say one thing,
and I have to correct you.

11:39.708 --> 11:42.375
No, no, no.
We need to be a team,

11:42.916 --> 11:44.125
and work together.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.291
So, what do you think? Tell me.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.166
I think...

11:50.750 --> 11:53.208
that your mentality is very immature.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.000
-Mature?
-Immature.

11:56.041 --> 11:59.750
And I also think you still depend strongly
on your mother.

12:00.083 --> 12:03.125
You also don't make use
of this space as you should.

12:03.791 --> 12:07.250
And I strongly can't think
of how you could help me.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.291
As a secretary?

12:14.958 --> 12:15.958
Was I not clear?

12:17.916 --> 12:20.958
In order to do this, Darío,
you require studies.

12:21.916 --> 12:23.541
Yes? It requires effort.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.000
Are we done?

12:28.458 --> 12:29.708
Yes, we're done. Yes.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.291
Can you hand me a big book?

12:42.083 --> 12:42.916
Yes.

12:44.416 --> 12:46.583
-This one?
-No. Bigger than this one.

12:52.833 --> 12:53.666
Like that.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.708
What happened?

13:01.875 --> 13:04.000
I just felt a little dizzy, that's all.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.041
-Again?
-No!

13:05.125 --> 13:07.375
It's nothing. Nothing.

13:07.583 --> 13:08.791
When's your checkup?

13:09.583 --> 13:11.958
-I'll ask Norita.
-Yeah, ask her.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.041
All right.

13:14.583 --> 13:15.958
-Hey.
-What?

13:16.458 --> 13:18.083
You got to look after this bump.

13:20.541 --> 13:21.875
Got something in mind?

13:23.166 --> 13:25.125
Seems there's an alumni reunion.

13:25.541 --> 13:26.375
We could go.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.916
-Where?
-In a club.

13:30.083 --> 13:30.916
A club?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.916
Try first, it has very little salt.

13:39.083 --> 13:40.375
You might want more.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.875
I can't eat salt.

13:42.666 --> 13:44.083
-Only a little.
-No, ma.

13:45.541 --> 13:47.083
Else, it tastes bland.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.750
It doesn't taste bland.

13:59.458 --> 14:00.666
When's the checkup?

14:03.333 --> 14:04.541
On Thursday.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.208
I won't add salt on tomorrow's food.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.625
I'm not cooking any more fried food.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.333
All right.

14:25.708 --> 14:26.541
Water, Nora?

14:29.833 --> 14:30.666
Nora.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.666
I brought the Inspired
and flowery model.

15:30.750 --> 15:31.583
What?

15:31.833 --> 15:33.166
I brought you flowers.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.375
What?

15:35.500 --> 15:39.541
The Inspired model's over there
along with the flowery design.

15:39.625 --> 15:40.458
All right.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.458
Hi, honey.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.125
-Hi.
-No, Mom, back off.

16:08.208 --> 16:11.250
-Why are you here?
-Why wouldn't I be?

16:12.833 --> 16:13.791
It's so hot.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.416
Yeah.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.958
Can't they set up a waiting room
with AC?

16:18.666 --> 16:19.541
She's coming!

16:20.000 --> 16:21.500
Look, look...

16:31.333 --> 16:32.166
Courses with?

16:33.666 --> 16:34.500
Sorrati.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.458
Not that son of a bitch!

16:36.541 --> 16:37.916
Biggest son of a bitch.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.000
I bet there's no one
who didn't retake that course,

16:41.083 --> 16:43.666
-or at least three times. What a bastard.
-Only Germán.

16:45.458 --> 16:49.083
What about Germán?
This is his first time under Sorrati.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.375
Still dunno if he passed. Relax.

16:52.541 --> 16:54.125
Did you send the planners?

16:55.291 --> 16:56.125
Yes.

16:56.208 --> 16:58.208
Yes? There wasn't a problem?

16:59.083 --> 17:01.916
Good. I'm glad.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.208
I asked you for a project
and paid in advance.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.040
And it was a hefty sum.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.750
You didn't send a single one!
Not one!

17:10.833 --> 17:12.708
-Lower your voice.
-No, I won't!

17:18.915 --> 17:19.915
You had therapy?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.083
Didn't I tell you?

17:22.165 --> 17:23.708
-I won't go anymore.
-What?

17:23.790 --> 17:25.665
I'm not going anymore! Come on.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.000
I've been discharged.

17:28.708 --> 17:29.958
Discharged?

17:31.708 --> 17:34.791
"You're discharged"?
Did the therapist tell you that?

17:35.416 --> 17:37.583
We came to that decision together.

17:38.416 --> 17:40.500
Why should I explain to you?
Why tell you?

17:40.583 --> 17:41.625
Look, look, look.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.250
What joy!

17:45.791 --> 17:48.541
-It's a...
-There he is! Look! There!

17:48.625 --> 17:49.750
Go, honey, hit him!

17:50.208 --> 17:52.166
Harder! Hit him!

17:52.500 --> 17:53.750
What a waste!

17:54.708 --> 17:55.666
Higher!

18:43.625 --> 18:45.625
What is it? Looking for something?

18:45.708 --> 18:47.625
Something of Celeste's.

18:48.041 --> 18:50.375
There's nothing there.
That's my drawer.

18:50.458 --> 18:51.958
Tidy up and close it.

18:53.083 --> 18:56.500
-I only want to see the results.
-They're not there. Why?

18:59.458 --> 19:01.333
I want to know how she's doing.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.708
She's doing fine.

19:03.416 --> 19:04.833
Tell me where they are.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.833
Do you understand those things?

19:08.083 --> 19:09.041
No, not at all.

19:09.791 --> 19:12.125
But I can show a doctor
and ask his opinion.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.958
No, I take her to the doctor
'cause I'm her mother.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.291
You won't do a thing.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.291
Close that drawer.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.333
Nora, I care for your daughter.

19:22.125 --> 19:23.250
And want to help.

19:43.041 --> 19:43.875
Who is it?

19:43.958 --> 19:45.208
Mercedes Oliverti.

19:49.416 --> 19:50.541
I'm Darío's mother.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.583
-Yes. Eh...
-Remember me?

19:52.833 --> 19:55.583
Right, I'm very busy at the moment.
What do you need?

19:55.666 --> 19:56.791
Where's the divan?

19:57.125 --> 19:59.041
-What divan?
-Your divan, doctor.

19:59.208 --> 20:01.916
Hold, on. What do you need, ma'am?
Wait a minute...

20:02.000 --> 20:04.541
To have a little chat.
I only have time now.

20:04.708 --> 20:05.708
Chat about what?

20:33.750 --> 20:35.916
He doesn't know it,
but there was a twin.

20:37.291 --> 20:39.708
Darío? Does he have a brother?

20:43.875 --> 20:45.750
Actually, during childbirth...

20:47.416 --> 20:48.458
the other baby...

20:51.000 --> 20:52.916
Actually, I call him Darío, too.

20:53.375 --> 20:56.416
I don't know why, but...
I gave him the same name.

20:59.583 --> 21:00.458
Well...

21:02.375 --> 21:04.833
During birth, Darío came out first.

21:07.291 --> 21:09.166
And he accidentally...

21:10.458 --> 21:13.541
...tied the cord
around the other babe.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.000
Around the brother.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.208
He strangled him.

21:25.916 --> 21:28.333
You think this is why he's stuck?

21:30.791 --> 21:33.625
Is that why he can't move on?

21:35.625 --> 21:36.458
No.

21:36.750 --> 21:37.583
I doubt it.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.250
I never told him.

21:43.916 --> 21:44.750
But that's it.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.666
That's how he came to be.

21:49.958 --> 21:51.125
Through murder.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.458
Will you ask him to come back?

22:09.291 --> 22:10.125
No.

22:10.208 --> 22:12.666
I doubt that's a good idea-- What?

22:12.875 --> 22:14.958
Hi, honey!

22:15.791 --> 22:17.791
-Don't say you're here.
-You're at the party?

22:17.875 --> 22:20.458
No, no, no.
I'm having a drink with friends.

22:21.875 --> 22:23.708
Yes, darling. What is it?

22:24.541 --> 22:26.208
I get it, okay. That's fine.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.500
No, don't worry, I won't butt in.

22:29.250 --> 22:32.208
There's food if you feel hungry.
In the fridge.

22:32.875 --> 22:35.958
There's a delicious squash pie
with onions.

22:36.416 --> 22:38.583
Heat it a minute in the microwave.

22:38.666 --> 22:40.208
-Or try it cold.
-Or eat it cold.

22:40.291 --> 22:42.958
-He's an adult.
-Yes, you're an adult, Darío.

22:43.541 --> 22:46.458
Take care, honey.
Should we have lunch tomorrow?

22:46.916 --> 22:50.083
He hung up. No, no.
I forgot to tell you something.

22:50.166 --> 22:51.583
What?

22:54.416 --> 22:57.291
Don't you have something here

22:57.708 --> 22:59.458
to give Darío?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.458
No. I don't do prescriptions.
Can't medicate him.

23:02.541 --> 23:05.541
No, I don't mean a prescription, doctor.
Like a job.

23:06.416 --> 23:08.208
A job? That thing with the job again?

23:08.291 --> 23:09.333
Who do you think I am?

23:09.416 --> 23:10.791
-Any job?
-No!

23:10.916 --> 23:12.458
-Think about it.
-I won't.

23:12.541 --> 23:15.333
-I work alone.
-We could reach an understanding.

23:15.583 --> 23:17.375
What kind of understanding?

23:18.708 --> 23:21.000
I give you the money for his salary.

23:23.916 --> 23:25.250
And more, of course.

23:28.291 --> 23:29.333
Think about it.

23:42.416 --> 23:46.166
So cute, so cute.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.083
Beautiful.

23:58.833 --> 24:00.166
You're wearing makeup?

24:00.291 --> 24:01.125
Yes.

24:01.625 --> 24:03.375
Haven't seen you like that.

24:03.750 --> 24:04.583
You will now.

24:05.583 --> 24:07.625
It's all right. You're two faced.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.625
-Where is it?
-North.

24:10.458 --> 24:12.291
-But where?
-I'll take you.

24:15.416 --> 24:16.750
How are we getting in?

24:17.125 --> 24:20.083
With the guy from work.
He's going to the club.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.916
-Did you tell him?
-No. What would I tell him?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.125
Tell us, come on!

24:43.583 --> 24:47.333
Were bricks and domes
used in the Byzantine Empire?

24:47.916 --> 24:48.916
No!

24:49.541 --> 24:50.458
No!

24:50.875 --> 24:54.125
Seemed impossible. I didn't think so.
But I didn't know that answer.

24:54.208 --> 24:55.958
I didn't study that part exactly.

24:56.083 --> 24:57.166
So I drew a blank.

24:57.250 --> 25:00.125
I didn't know what to do.
And right then, guys,

25:00.458 --> 25:03.375
I remembered
that the night before, my father

25:03.458 --> 25:05.791
had given me a penholder.

25:05.875 --> 25:08.500
A fancy one, made of gold,
or it was golden, at least.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.625
So I said: "Sorrati,

25:11.208 --> 25:12.625
begging your pardon,

25:12.708 --> 25:14.875
I'd like to give you this
for your dedication,

25:14.958 --> 25:18.208
and love for architecture,
and blah, blah, blah,

25:18.416 --> 25:20.041
as a gift."

25:20.416 --> 25:22.250
So, I gave him the penholder

25:22.791 --> 25:26.041
and he stares at me.
Looks me straight in the eye

25:26.166 --> 25:28.875
and says: "So, architect Albert,

25:28.958 --> 25:30.291
do you want a B+?"

25:32.125 --> 25:33.500
Success!

25:35.791 --> 25:38.000
Good move with that penholder.

25:38.208 --> 25:41.625
-I saw that. He likes you.
-He likes me a lot apparently.

25:42.250 --> 25:43.958
I didn't plan ahead.

25:44.833 --> 25:47.375
Hold on, hold on.
So, you have him the penholder,

25:47.458 --> 25:48.958
and what did he ask then?

25:49.041 --> 25:51.583
No... What?
He didn't ask me anything.

25:51.666 --> 25:54.000
He asked me
about the Byzantine Empire,

25:54.666 --> 25:57.041
and I gave him the penholder.
He didn't ask anything.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.333
Excuse me.

26:09.208 --> 26:11.875
Excuse me,
could I have a gin and tonic?

26:23.333 --> 26:24.916
One gin and tonic, please.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.166
That one?

28:29.750 --> 28:31.833
-Which one?
-That one. The tall one.

28:32.083 --> 28:33.166
Tall and slim guy.

28:34.291 --> 28:37.625
Him? No. Awful, don't like him.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.333
No, no. Do you like him?

28:53.625 --> 28:54.458
You like him?

28:55.083 --> 28:55.916
Yes.

28:57.291 --> 28:58.125
Sure?

29:01.291 --> 29:02.125
I'll get him.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.208
Count.

29:07.708 --> 29:10.041
One, two, three.

29:26.958 --> 29:29.125
You have a big house.

29:32.541 --> 29:34.375
It's not mine. It's my mom's.

29:35.041 --> 29:38.750
I'm making a few changes at home,
and I have my studio there...

29:47.625 --> 29:48.750
What're you having?

29:48.916 --> 29:50.458
-I'm not thirsty.
-Really?

29:50.625 --> 29:52.250
No drinks? Look what I got.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.000
For you, for you, for you.

29:56.833 --> 29:57.916
-No?
-No, thanks.

29:59.666 --> 30:01.083
I'll have a drink.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.833
Sure you won't drink?

30:08.208 --> 30:09.041
No.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.458
Not even a little?

30:11.000 --> 30:11.833
A small taste?

30:22.208 --> 30:24.041
It's all right. Look it's fine, fine.

30:24.125 --> 30:24.958
It's fine.

30:38.333 --> 30:40.750
Come, come, come.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.500
Come, come, come.

31:12.625 --> 31:13.500
You sure?

31:13.916 --> 31:14.750
Yes.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.250
-Let me.
-All right.

31:48.833 --> 31:50.458
-Wait.
-Give it to me...

31:50.541 --> 31:52.583
No, no. What is it? What is it?

31:58.166 --> 31:59.375
Stop.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.875
-Stop. What is it?
-No condom.

32:05.416 --> 32:07.375
No, I don't know you. No condom?

32:12.333 --> 32:15.291
-Here, here, let me.
-Wait, wait, wait.

32:16.875 --> 32:19.083
Love, are you all right?
Are you sure?

32:20.916 --> 32:23.000
No, stop, stop, stop.

32:24.041 --> 32:25.000
-Go.
-I'm not leaving.

32:25.208 --> 32:27.000
-Go now...
-No!

32:27.500 --> 32:29.583
Fuck me! Please!

32:30.208 --> 32:31.041
Go on, beat it.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.000
-What are you doing?
-Fucking hell!

32:33.083 --> 32:34.208
-You okay, darling?
-Yes.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.375
Stay still or I'll kill you, okay?

32:36.833 --> 32:37.958
-You okay, darling?
-Yes.

32:38.041 --> 32:40.000
-You sure he didn't hurt you?
-No.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.083
What do you want?

32:41.166 --> 32:42.708
-Should we stay or go?
-No.

32:42.791 --> 32:44.083
-Wanna stay?
-Yes.

32:44.666 --> 32:46.166
Listen, here's the deal.

32:46.875 --> 32:48.458
You're going to fuck her.

32:48.541 --> 32:49.500
Yes?

32:49.583 --> 32:53.375
If you hurt her, I'll cut your throat,
you fucking asshole.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.166
You'll fuck her and then we'll leave.
Are we clear?

32:58.375 --> 32:59.208
Good.

32:59.791 --> 33:01.500
-No, no!
-Hey!

33:01.583 --> 33:03.333
I just said I would kill you.

33:04.166 --> 33:05.500
Shall I repeat myself?

33:06.208 --> 33:09.000
She'll take off your pants,
and you'll fuck her.

33:09.083 --> 33:11.125
Yeah? Go, Celeste. Go.

33:12.208 --> 33:13.208
It's flaccid.

33:15.083 --> 33:16.625
Is it so difficult?

33:16.916 --> 33:18.083
Don't you get it?

33:35.375 --> 33:36.500
You brought her here.

33:37.708 --> 33:39.416
You liked her and felt horny.

33:40.375 --> 33:41.208
Go on.

33:54.291 --> 33:55.291
Let me.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.208
Now?

36:10.833 --> 36:12.375
So, your girl's dating?

36:12.541 --> 36:13.958
Something like that.

36:14.416 --> 36:15.666
Hope it goes well.

36:16.458 --> 36:17.333
I doubt it.

36:19.166 --> 36:21.333
Why do you say that?
What's wrong?

36:22.750 --> 36:26.833
I saw the last results
and they didn't look good.

36:28.791 --> 36:31.916
I try to distract her,
take her to the movies.

36:32.875 --> 36:35.500
I do what she likes,
I buy her things.

36:35.583 --> 36:37.291
She will be fine!

36:45.125 --> 36:46.125
On time.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.791
And now she became a lesbian.

36:56.208 --> 36:57.458
She has a partner.

37:02.333 --> 37:05.500
She brought her home
and both live with me now.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.166
I have to go, Nora.

37:14.583 --> 37:17.041
I'm finally
getting somewhere with my son.

39:09.333 --> 39:10.333
Darío.

39:15.791 --> 39:17.583
Darío, can you answer that?

39:27.916 --> 39:28.791
Hey!

39:30.666 --> 39:31.500
Hello?

39:35.041 --> 39:37.291
-Hey, what's wrong?
-Go, Mom, just go.

39:37.416 --> 39:38.750
No, I'm not leaving.

39:39.791 --> 39:42.625
Turns out this is my home too
so I'm not leaving.

39:44.958 --> 39:45.791
What's wrong?

39:48.333 --> 39:49.166
Are you sad?

39:53.125 --> 39:54.708
You think your life's sad?

39:56.833 --> 39:58.041
You know what's sad?

39:59.625 --> 40:00.458
Ask Nora

40:01.208 --> 40:02.291
whose daughter is sick.

40:02.416 --> 40:04.583
And to top it all, she's a lesbian.

40:11.791 --> 40:12.875
Guess who called.

40:14.041 --> 40:15.250
Your psychologist.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.083
Santiago.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.583
He left a message. Nora heard it.

40:22.166 --> 40:23.166
What did he say?

40:24.500 --> 40:27.750
Look, from what I could gather,

40:28.291 --> 40:29.166
looks like

40:29.250 --> 40:32.041
he'll offer you a job as his secretary.

40:35.583 --> 40:38.541
And Nora says he sounded very excited.

40:42.041 --> 40:44.708
I am so happy, so happy.

40:47.375 --> 40:48.375
It must be him.

40:50.041 --> 40:50.875
Mom.

40:51.541 --> 40:53.625
-I don't want to see him.
-Why not?

40:54.916 --> 40:56.083
Something awful happened.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.500
-When?
-Ma'am.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.333
-Yes?
-It's the psychologist.

40:59.541 --> 41:00.791
See him in.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.291
-I don't want to see him!
-What?

41:02.375 --> 41:04.875
-Mom, I said I don't want to.
-But, why?

41:09.333 --> 41:11.250
Good afternoon. Come in, please.

41:11.333 --> 41:12.666
-Excuse me.
-Of course.

41:13.958 --> 41:14.916
Santiago!

41:16.000 --> 41:16.833
How are you?

41:17.375 --> 41:19.250
-How are you?
-How's everything?

41:20.333 --> 41:21.333
Come in.

41:22.458 --> 41:23.708
Something to drink?

41:23.875 --> 41:27.458
-Coffee, please.
-Sure. Coffee for the doctor, Nora.

41:27.666 --> 41:31.250
-Two coffees. One's for me.
-Ma'am, I have to leave already.

41:32.666 --> 41:34.208
-Didn't you want to talk?
-Yes.

41:34.541 --> 41:36.458
Well? Do it now that he's here.

41:37.416 --> 41:40.250
Go make him a coffee.
Then we'll talk about your daughter.

41:43.541 --> 41:47.458
Norita wanted to ask you something.
She's like family,

41:47.666 --> 41:49.416
so you can settle things
with me later.

41:50.250 --> 41:51.083
Right.

41:51.333 --> 41:52.625
-There he is.
-Hey, Santiago.

41:52.708 --> 41:55.000
-Thanks, Darío. How are you?
-Fine.

41:57.208 --> 41:59.583
-I'm sorry this was unexpected.
-It's all right.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.166
I don't know if...

42:01.791 --> 42:03.333
I needed to talk to you.

42:05.041 --> 42:06.541
Did you mother tell you?

42:07.166 --> 42:11.875
Yes, I told him that Nora
heard the voice message.

42:13.666 --> 42:14.583
Voice message?

42:15.375 --> 42:16.500
It's fine. Mom, go.

42:16.708 --> 42:17.916
It's fine, leave us.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.708
Very well. Santiago, I'll go.

42:20.708 --> 42:22.958
-See you. It was a pleasure.
-See you.

42:30.166 --> 42:31.000
Well...

42:31.875 --> 42:33.291
How are you doing?

42:34.791 --> 42:36.083
I'm fine, fine.

42:36.625 --> 42:38.458
I'm doing just swell. I'm fine.

42:44.958 --> 42:47.208
You wanted to ask me something?

42:47.291 --> 42:48.791
Yes, but I must go now.

42:49.250 --> 42:50.625
All right, let's do this.

42:50.708 --> 42:52.125
I'll give you my card then.

42:52.291 --> 42:53.875
-All right.
-Call me

42:54.458 --> 42:55.500
if you need anything.

42:55.666 --> 42:57.375
Of course. I'll call you, doctor.

42:57.583 --> 43:00.458
-I'll call.
-It's something personal, right?

43:00.541 --> 43:01.750
This was between us.

43:01.833 --> 43:04.500
-Nora, please go. Go.
-Yes, thank you.

43:04.666 --> 43:05.833
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

43:09.291 --> 43:12.458
What's up with your call
and some message?

43:16.291 --> 43:20.416
Look, I was thinking
about our chat the other day,

43:22.166 --> 43:25.000
when you showed interest
about working for me.

43:28.541 --> 43:30.000
I think that could work.

43:33.458 --> 43:36.125
Right now, I need an aide

43:36.208 --> 43:37.333
and thought of you.

43:38.458 --> 43:39.375
An aide?

43:41.291 --> 43:44.125
Yes, do you have time?
What with college and all that.

43:44.916 --> 43:47.708
I don't get why an aide, that's all.

43:49.458 --> 43:51.625
Well, it's close
so you'll manage your schedule

43:51.708 --> 43:53.666
and won't need to go far.
Besides,

43:54.208 --> 43:56.583
I need you to lend me a hand
with some things...

43:56.708 --> 43:58.625
Excuse me. I was just passing.

43:58.958 --> 44:01.041
I didn't hear what you just said.

44:02.666 --> 44:05.666
I was telling Darío that I needed an aide
for the office.

44:05.958 --> 44:07.291
-That's odd.
-Why?

44:07.791 --> 44:11.458
Because Nora said you wanted
a secretary, not an aide.

44:13.041 --> 44:17.375
She most likely got confused,
because I don't need a secretary.

44:17.791 --> 44:18.625
Right. Nora!

44:20.208 --> 44:21.041
Come, please.

44:21.916 --> 44:23.000
Yes, ma'am?

44:23.250 --> 44:25.541
Tell me,
when you spoke to Santiago,

44:25.625 --> 44:27.250
or when you heard his message,

44:27.333 --> 44:29.666
did he say "secretary"
or "aide"?

44:30.541 --> 44:32.333
I don't remember, ma'am.

44:32.416 --> 44:36.083
You don't? Oh, well. Go, go.

44:37.750 --> 44:39.416
-It's fine, Mom, go.
-No, but...

44:39.500 --> 44:40.333
Leave us.

44:40.416 --> 44:42.583
You think someone like him
should run errands?

44:43.375 --> 44:45.416
Given Darío's strong personality?

44:46.291 --> 44:48.375
And his background as well?

44:48.541 --> 44:50.291
-Go, Mom, go.
-I don't see the issue.

44:50.833 --> 44:52.958
I see. Smart of you.

44:53.791 --> 44:55.958
So, you'll make my son run errands?

44:56.250 --> 44:59.083
I believe
that you're not seeing the big picture.

44:59.166 --> 45:00.916
May we speak a moment alone?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.208
-Just a moment, in private.
-I don't understand.

45:03.458 --> 45:04.958
No, no, no.
Darío, let's do this.

45:05.500 --> 45:08.333
Think it through, then call me.

45:08.625 --> 45:09.458
All right?

45:11.625 --> 45:13.708
-What's wrong?
-I don't understand.

45:20.000 --> 45:20.833
Look, Darío.

45:22.666 --> 45:24.000
We want to help you.

45:24.458 --> 45:25.625
It's for you, yes?

45:27.500 --> 45:32.000
We believe that if you have a job

45:33.291 --> 45:36.875
you'll fill your time
and it'll allow you...

45:38.125 --> 45:40.083
to grow, too.

45:41.041 --> 45:43.458
When your mother came
to my office...

45:43.666 --> 45:45.458
-To the office?
-Yes.

45:46.125 --> 45:47.875
I never went to your office.

45:49.708 --> 45:51.500
I don't even know where it is.

45:52.083 --> 45:53.833
I want to help you, Darío.

45:56.041 --> 45:57.750
-Leave.
-I don't know what he means...

45:57.833 --> 45:59.250
-Get out, go on.
-That's absurd.

45:59.333 --> 46:01.208
-Get out, get out. Go.
-Completely absurd.

46:02.916 --> 46:04.958
Didn't you hear him? Leave.

46:05.875 --> 46:07.583
-Forgive me, Darío.
-Enough.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.083
-It's done.
-Forgive me.

46:10.583 --> 46:11.833
Go on, take your things.

46:12.625 --> 46:13.666
Nice raincoat.

46:13.958 --> 46:15.458
How much did it cost?

46:15.666 --> 46:17.708
Did you buy it
with what we paid you?

46:19.708 --> 46:20.541
Unbelievable.

46:20.666 --> 46:21.791
Saying that I asked him.

46:43.750 --> 46:46.708
There, there. Don't cry, don't cry.

46:46.791 --> 46:49.250
-Mom, please...
-He's gone. It's over.

46:49.916 --> 46:53.000
You don't need to get a job.
You must focus on your studies.

46:53.750 --> 46:55.041
Wash your face. Come.

46:55.916 --> 46:57.666
Come and wash your face.

46:59.875 --> 47:01.541
-Let me wash you...
-No, Mom.

47:01.625 --> 47:03.125
Some cool water.

47:04.500 --> 47:08.208
Let me help you!
Let me help you!

48:29.125 --> 48:36.125
POLICE STATION

48:38.791 --> 48:44.291
ISRAELI HOSPITAL

48:44.375 --> 48:45.291
Take a seat.

48:45.375 --> 48:47.833
In a few minutes,
we'll call you for the ultrasound.

48:48.041 --> 48:48.958
Thanks, doctor.

48:49.708 --> 48:50.541
Want to sit here?

49:08.583 --> 49:10.000
-Does it hurt?
-No.

49:22.791 --> 49:23.708
See something?

49:25.125 --> 49:25.958
Yes.

49:28.083 --> 49:29.208
Is it like a photograph?

49:29.791 --> 49:30.625
Exactly.

49:35.791 --> 49:36.625
What is it?

49:37.500 --> 49:38.541
Nothing.

49:43.833 --> 49:45.416
Well, there.

49:51.291 --> 49:54.250
-That's the baby?
-Of course. Look there.

49:55.333 --> 49:56.541
Six weeks old.

49:58.291 --> 50:00.291
You see that little spot there?

50:00.875 --> 50:01.708
That's the heart.

50:03.833 --> 50:04.666
Is he a boy?

50:05.208 --> 50:08.750
I don't know! There's still some time
before we can be sure.

50:09.791 --> 50:12.083
Is the size right?
Is everything fine?

50:12.958 --> 50:16.166
Yes, everything looks normal.
Now you must see an obstetrician.

50:16.666 --> 50:18.291
He'll explain everything.

50:22.791 --> 50:24.583
You feel calmer now?

50:26.041 --> 50:26.875
All right.

50:28.208 --> 50:30.125
I'll hand you some paper
to wipe yourself.

50:38.666 --> 50:39.500
Thanks.

50:43.291 --> 50:46.083
There you go.
I'll fetch the full report.

50:46.166 --> 50:48.041
-All right, all right.
-Is that okay?

50:48.500 --> 50:49.958
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

50:50.041 --> 50:51.458
There's more paper here.

51:06.333 --> 51:08.541
-Patricio.
-Luciano

51:09.833 --> 51:11.458
-Diego.
-Yes, Diego.

51:12.416 --> 51:13.250
Gerardo?

51:15.458 --> 51:17.083
Choose one we'll both like.

51:22.166 --> 51:23.000
Nicolás?

51:23.958 --> 51:25.208
Yes, I like Nicolás.

51:27.250 --> 51:29.083
-You know which one's good?
-Which one?

51:29.416 --> 51:30.250
Miguel.

51:30.458 --> 51:31.541
-Miguel?
-Yes.

51:31.916 --> 51:35.125
I like it. "Come here, Miguelito."

51:35.416 --> 51:36.958
-An old man's name.
-No!

51:37.708 --> 51:38.541
Yes.

51:39.833 --> 51:40.666
Lucas.

51:41.833 --> 51:42.666
Lucas?

51:44.166 --> 51:45.000
"Lucas!"

51:46.750 --> 51:48.625
-I like it. And you?
-Yes.

51:51.625 --> 51:52.458
He moved!

51:52.666 --> 51:54.208
That's not possible!

51:55.250 --> 51:56.791
-He liked it...
-You hungry?

51:58.916 --> 52:01.166
-I am.
-And you?

52:02.041 --> 52:02.875
All right.

52:03.333 --> 52:05.208
All right, I'll start cooking.

52:09.166 --> 52:10.333
You've earned your bread.

52:16.333 --> 52:18.541
-I adore you!
-Me too.

52:20.291 --> 52:21.125
I love you.

52:21.791 --> 52:23.166
-Come here.
-Wait.

52:23.250 --> 52:24.083
Need help, Nora?

52:24.416 --> 52:26.916
Yes, peel those carrots

52:27.000 --> 52:28.625
and chop them, please.

52:47.833 --> 52:52.208
The long cold nights
Without your love

52:53.083 --> 52:56.125
Felt like an eternity

52:58.250 --> 53:02.583
Loneliness had frozen my heart

53:02.833 --> 53:06.750
Until the day I finally met you

53:07.458 --> 53:09.416
And now I want to tell you

53:09.541 --> 53:13.250
You're all I see
When I close my eyes

53:13.833 --> 53:16.625
I want you to know
That the world makes no sense

53:16.750 --> 53:18.375
If you're not around

53:18.791 --> 53:20.541
Without your kisses,
I lose it

53:20.666 --> 53:23.541
I stop breathing
And die slowly

53:24.208 --> 53:27.416
Without your laughter,
The light in me fades

53:32.041 --> 53:33.083
Come on!

54:05.791 --> 54:06.875
Take this one...

54:57.375 --> 54:59.250
Elena,
can you come on Saturday?

55:00.375 --> 55:02.791
-We have to be present.
-What for?

55:04.916 --> 55:06.083
A council vote.

55:07.583 --> 55:11.708
We must pick a delegate,
spokesman, secretary, and so on.

55:12.916 --> 55:14.625
I don't know much about that.

55:16.500 --> 55:18.958
But it'd be nice if you come,
Elena, so we're many...

55:19.041 --> 55:20.416
I'm Lena. Without the "e."

55:26.000 --> 55:29.541
And after we could maybe go for a drink,
and have a beer...

55:31.000 --> 55:31.916
You like dancing?

55:32.250 --> 55:34.541
-Did you hear there's a new club?
-No.

55:35.666 --> 55:38.291
-It's open some nights...
-I'll see if the truck is coming.

56:00.500 --> 56:01.708
Nora?

56:02.125 --> 56:05.041
Norita, where are you?
The guests are almost here.

56:05.375 --> 56:06.333
"Everything's ready"?

56:07.041 --> 56:09.000
No, I asked you to come tonight!

56:09.875 --> 56:12.000
Get that box there. Take those.

56:12.458 --> 56:15.458
Come on, Norita, please!
You know I can't do it.

56:16.541 --> 56:18.541
I don't even know
where the napkins are!

56:19.083 --> 56:20.166
Where are the napkins?

56:20.750 --> 56:21.833
All right.

56:22.583 --> 56:25.083
Bring her! Go on, bring her too!

56:25.833 --> 56:27.625
She can sleep in Darío's room.

56:28.416 --> 56:30.625
Good. Place all there, please,
or it looks bad.

56:31.291 --> 56:32.125
Yes.

56:32.208 --> 56:33.416
All right, take a cab.

56:34.000 --> 56:34.958
Tell him to hurry.

56:35.250 --> 56:38.166
He can take the highway,
or follow the river, wherever.

56:38.666 --> 56:39.500
All right.

56:39.625 --> 56:41.291
Yes, that was the bell.

56:41.833 --> 56:42.750
Come on, hurry.

57:02.083 --> 57:03.416
Look at this.

57:05.916 --> 57:06.958
Isn't it fabulous?

57:07.208 --> 57:08.041
Have a smoke.

57:08.458 --> 57:09.541
Enjoy the party.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.791
What a lovely piano, right?

57:13.000 --> 57:14.208
It's a grand piano.

57:14.708 --> 57:16.666
I believe it's an upright piano.

57:16.750 --> 57:18.916
Upright, spinet, whatever Alberto.

57:19.125 --> 57:20.166
Play, go on.

57:20.375 --> 57:22.125
Let's see if it's tuned.

57:22.208 --> 57:24.083
Just play!

57:24.333 --> 57:25.166
It's tuned.

57:25.791 --> 57:27.958
Meche's going to love
if you play something.

57:28.041 --> 57:29.000
What's this?

57:45.041 --> 57:46.291
Thank you, dear.

58:07.916 --> 58:09.625
Sorry, how'd that go again?

58:10.833 --> 58:11.666
The ending?

58:19.500 --> 58:21.458
It's good, go on, go on.
Continue.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.458
Play something fun, Alberto.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.916
Honey, will you do me a favor?

59:01.041 --> 59:03.500
Could you buy more ice?
We've run out.

59:03.708 --> 59:05.041
-Now?
-Now.

59:06.083 --> 59:07.500
Do you like the party?

59:07.916 --> 59:08.750
It's a drag.

59:09.208 --> 59:10.791
Why a drag?
You heard Alberto play?

59:11.291 --> 59:14.291
-That's exactly why.
-You'll like it.

59:14.375 --> 59:15.208
Give me money.

59:15.291 --> 59:16.791
Take it from the safe.

59:17.291 --> 59:18.208
Hurry back.

59:18.541 --> 59:19.708
Mariachi's on its way.

59:20.083 --> 59:22.500
-What? Why a mariachi?
-You'll love it!

59:48.541 --> 59:52.875
Come, Darío.
Give me a hand with my daughter?

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.375
I know you're not involved, that's clear.

01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:24.958
But it was still a crime,

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:26.833
however you put it.

01:00:30.083 --> 01:00:32.291
You know
there's security cameras here.

01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:35.666
Besides, we have Darío's testimony.

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:40.916
And you know my lawyers are the best.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.125
Both girls will be arrested.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:18.875
Hello, Lena!

01:01:18.958 --> 01:01:19.791
Hello.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:20.916
Is something wrong?

01:01:21.541 --> 01:01:22.375
No, no.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.958
Then get to work, please.

01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:26.083
Yes, I'm on it.

01:03:44.708 --> 01:03:47.125
Come back later, Darío.
Let us sleep.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.750
What?
You want me to go for a stroll?

01:03:49.833 --> 01:03:51.166
This neighborhood scares me.

01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:54.333
Celeste threw up all night.

01:03:54.541 --> 01:03:57.041
-She's tired and needs rest.
-Hasn't she seen a doctor?

01:03:57.583 --> 01:04:00.958
Which doctor? It's normal
for pregnant women to throw up.

01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:05.083
I didn't know. I see.

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:06.958
I feel sick.

01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:08.833
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:09.958
Want me to join you?

01:04:10.708 --> 01:04:12.250
No, the bathroom's clogged.

01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:14.541
-I see, I see.
-Do you know how to unclog it?

01:04:14.625 --> 01:04:17.041
-No, I don't do that.
-Darío, come back later.

01:04:17.125 --> 01:04:18.750
Quiet, Nora, please!

01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:20.666
Hey, mind your tone!

01:04:20.875 --> 01:04:23.583
I've known her all my life.
It's always been this way.

01:04:40.791 --> 01:04:41.833
What do you want?

01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:47.291
I want my child.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.875
So you wielded the knife.

01:05:43.833 --> 01:05:44.708
You're called Lena.

01:05:45.666 --> 01:05:46.500
What's your name?

01:05:47.125 --> 01:05:47.958
Lena.

01:05:48.416 --> 01:05:50.083
What's your real name?

01:05:50.166 --> 01:05:51.000
It's Lena.

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:53.291
The dangerous one.

01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:00.166
She needs to stay
'cause she feels sick.

01:06:00.583 --> 01:06:02.375
Is that so?
And who'll look after her?

01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:03.416
I will.

01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:04.500
And who are you?

01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:06.458
I am her partner.

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:08.750
But what are you to the child?

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:11.041
She'd be the other mother.

01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:11.958
Very well.

01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:13.875
-They'll raise him...
-Thank you, Darío.

01:06:13.958 --> 01:06:16.166
When I need your opinion
I'll ask you to talk.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.666
Genetically speaking, you have no value.

01:06:24.875 --> 01:06:26.875
My grandson's inside that belly.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.250
He's my son.

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:34.833
Well, it's already been proven

01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:38.458
that this child was conceived
via criminal abuse.

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:45.291
The accused, you,
have confessed and will apologize.

01:06:46.166 --> 01:06:47.375
And the victim...

01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:49.958
I want the child.

01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:52.041
No! Not yet.

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:55.708
If you apologize,
Darío won't denounce your actions

01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:58.166
and you won't go to prison.
Understood?

01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:01.583
So, now we must talk about the child.

01:07:02.208 --> 01:07:05.250
But Darío, we'd agreed
that you could visit him whenever.

01:07:05.333 --> 01:07:06.666
-Of course.
-And you too.

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:10.291
No! No.
I don't think so, I don't think so.

01:07:11.416 --> 01:07:14.500
I will not visit that neighborhood...

01:07:14.916 --> 01:07:17.666
And I don't consider it
a fitting place for a baby.

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:19.791
What do you mean?

01:07:20.625 --> 01:07:23.291
That house isn't appropriate.
Nor the neighborhood.

01:07:23.416 --> 01:07:26.291
Still, it's my child
and he'll live in my house.

01:07:26.416 --> 01:07:27.250
Your child?

01:07:27.708 --> 01:07:29.000
It's our child, too.

01:07:29.666 --> 01:07:31.333
Actually, you're nothing of his.

01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:34.708
With her it's another story.

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:39.375
Who'll raise him?

01:07:40.375 --> 01:07:41.291
You?

01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:44.041
You'll teach him to stab others?

01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:50.791
We all want what's best
for the child.

01:07:51.375 --> 01:07:52.416
Do we agree?

01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:53.833
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:56.875
Now, we need to discuss the nursing.

01:07:57.583 --> 01:07:58.416
What?

01:07:58.666 --> 01:08:01.666
At the beginning,
the child will need to be nursed.

01:08:02.541 --> 01:08:03.875
You want to keep the child?

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:05.500
-That's it?
-She got it now.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:07.416
Nora, you knew about this?

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:10.000
-And you didn't tell us?
-Mom!

01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:11.416
Listen to me, honey.

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:16.457
You love this child, right?

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:18.166
-Yes.
-What is it you love?

01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:19.500
Tell me. What do you love?

01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:23.416
What you love
is your desire to have a child!

01:08:24.457 --> 01:08:25.750
You don't love a real child.

01:08:25.832 --> 01:08:29.041
-Don't listen to her...
-Quiet! Don't be selfish.

01:08:30.082 --> 01:08:31.250
So no father figure?

01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:33.000
And what about no mother?

01:08:33.082 --> 01:08:33.916
That's my role.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.125
-No! What?
-No?

01:08:35.332 --> 01:08:36.250
They want him.

01:08:36.332 --> 01:08:37.291
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

01:08:37.375 --> 01:08:39.082
-Wait, girls.
-Let's go, let's go.

01:08:39.166 --> 01:08:40.582
-Girls!
-Girls, wait.

01:08:40.666 --> 01:08:44.332
-No, no.
-Clause 25087 of the criminal code!

01:08:45.041 --> 01:08:46.291
You'll be arrested.

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:48.541
Do you understand?

01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:53.541
Come back and sit down.

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:08.207
Don't take him from us.
Please, don't take him.

01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:10.541
Girls, this baby's not a trophy.

01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:12.582
Of course not, it's our child.

01:09:13.166 --> 01:09:15.666
Mom, they don't want
to give him up.

01:09:15.916 --> 01:09:17.707
I don't understand.
What're you saying?

01:09:17.791 --> 01:09:20.582
Let's find a way for all of us
to raise the child together.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:23.291
Tell me something, Darío.

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:26.166
Do you care about this baby or not?

01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:27.707
-Yes, I do.
-Then?

01:09:28.082 --> 01:09:29.250
They care about him too.

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:31.791
I can't believe it.

01:09:32.666 --> 01:09:34.582
As a mother,
how can't you understand?

01:09:35.207 --> 01:09:36.582
-I can't believe it.
-I see.

01:09:38.125 --> 01:09:39.291
What'd I get myself into?

01:09:39.957 --> 01:09:43.332
What'd I get myself into?
Why do I even bother?

01:09:43.416 --> 01:09:45.375
All of this doesn't matter to me.

01:09:48.041 --> 01:09:49.416
Leave, girls. Keep the baby.

01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:51.291
-What?
-Yes, keep him.

01:09:51.541 --> 01:09:54.082
-Stop, Mom.
-Keep him, girls! Keep him.

01:09:54.708 --> 01:09:56.125
Take him, too!

01:09:57.666 --> 01:09:59.208
You're my burden, Darío.

01:09:59.833 --> 01:10:03.000
You're a mother's worst nightmare!
You're the worst!

01:11:23.708 --> 01:11:25.375
Go if that's what you want.

01:11:41.958 --> 01:11:48.416
500 M UGARTE STREET

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:12.416
-Hi, Nora!
-Hello, girls.

01:12:53.458 --> 01:12:54.291
Celeste.

01:12:57.708 --> 01:12:58.583
Celeste.

01:13:08.625 --> 01:13:09.750
Come on, time to get up.

01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:37.625
- Hey! What're you doing?
-Sorry!

01:13:37.708 --> 01:13:39.166
Don't you know how to knock?

01:13:39.291 --> 01:13:40.250
Whatever, let me in!

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.833
If you knock, you'll know
when someone's inside.

01:13:43.208 --> 01:13:45.041
Hand me the watch.
I need to go.

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:48.583
Tell me, did you use my shampoo?

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:49.541
No.

01:13:50.541 --> 01:13:51.791
-Nora!
-What?

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:53.750
-You used my shampoo?
-What?

01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:55.666
You used my shampoo
in the orange bottle?

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:56.666
Whatever.

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.666
I'm going to mark it, just in case.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:07.083
Morning! Morning! Morning!

01:14:07.208 --> 01:14:09.125
Yes, yes, yes...

01:14:09.916 --> 01:14:10.750
Hi.

01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:12.041
Hi.

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:13.583
How are you?

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.416
How are you?

01:14:16.333 --> 01:14:17.166
You like that?

01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:19.041
You like paprika?

01:14:19.375 --> 01:14:20.208
Yeah?

01:14:20.708 --> 01:14:22.791
You know where I left Celeste's syrup?

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.083
It's in the fridge.

01:14:24.541 --> 01:14:26.000
-You remember?
-Yes.

01:14:26.375 --> 01:14:27.208
Yes.

01:14:31.458 --> 01:14:32.708
Good morning.

01:14:33.708 --> 01:14:34.541
Sit down.

01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:41.250
Hi.

01:14:43.875 --> 01:14:44.916
Hi!

01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:47.583
Mom's going to work.

01:14:49.041 --> 01:14:50.208
Who's staying with you?

01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:52.791
Mom.

01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:54.458
Hi.

01:14:55.041 --> 01:14:56.791
Hi, chubby cheeks.

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.750
My little chubby boy.

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:01.458
I'm going.

01:15:06.375 --> 01:15:07.708
-You coming for lunch?
-Yeah.

01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:09.375
-When?
-In the afternoon.

01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:12.416
-At what time?
-Dunno around 2 or 2:30...

01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:15.083
By then, the food will be cold.

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:16.208
All right.

01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:20.791
I'll go to the market.

01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:22.833
Hi, hi, hi.

01:15:43.833 --> 01:15:45.333
-You washed your hands?
-Yes, yes.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:46.875
-With soap?
-Yes in the bathroom.

01:15:46.958 --> 01:15:48.958
Okay. Here's Daddy.

01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:11.208
Come here.

01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:13.083
Come here.

01:16:55.125 --> 01:16:57.458
-So?
-What?

01:16:59.125 --> 01:17:00.083
What did you see?

01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:02.333
A chubby one.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.208
With puffy cheeks.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.875
And his eyes were so, so dark.

01:17:17.041 --> 01:17:18.000
Let's play again.

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:20.416
One.

01:17:20.791 --> 01:17:21.625
Two.

01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:22.625
Three.
