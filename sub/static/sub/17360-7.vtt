WEBVTT

00:27.570 --> 00:29.780
Can't believe
that actually worked.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.615
What happened?

00:32.616 --> 00:33.658
Are we...

00:33.659 --> 00:35.785
Wh-Where are we?

00:35.786 --> 00:38.038
<i>Are we still here?</i>

00:38.039 --> 00:39.456
For the moment, yes.

00:39.457 --> 00:41.249
But at the moment? No.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.625
We're in the past.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.003
If I'm correct,
one week in the past.

00:45.004 --> 00:48.048
The Unlimited Energy Device
is a time machine?

00:48.049 --> 00:49.424
- Did you know that--
- Kind of a hunch, really.

00:49.425 --> 00:51.051
But the good news is--

00:52.261 --> 00:53.887
Never mind, there's
no good news. Hide.

01:03.189 --> 01:03.855
<i>All right, get the machine.</i>

01:03.856 --> 01:05.231
Plug it in.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.316
Put the dog there.

01:06.317 --> 01:08.401
We're switching her into the dog,
and the dog into her.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.611
Tie her in.

01:09.612 --> 01:11.279
That's Lydia!

01:16.368 --> 01:18.161
Strap her in tight.
Get her tight--

01:18.162 --> 01:20.246
Get her tight.
Oh, yeah. Careful...

01:20.247 --> 01:21.332
Careful with that.

01:22.917 --> 01:23.958
Good, good. Good.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.460
Good...

01:25.461 --> 01:27.504
Sorry about this, Rapunzel.

01:27.505 --> 01:29.340
Good, okay, now,
take her helmet and back up.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.468
Everybody, back up!

01:35.096 --> 01:36.846
All right, ready?
Okay, here we go.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.264
Three, two, one, go!

01:52.279 --> 01:53.864
Stay..

01:54.865 --> 01:56.575
Everybody, stay back.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.743
Stay-- stay back.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.121
Everybody, stay back. Okay.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.126
Hey, girl.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.711
Aw... there's my girl.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.131
Aw... okay.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.383
Okay, get the dog--

02:15.469 --> 02:17.720
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait!

02:17.721 --> 02:18.596
<i>Wait, wait, wait
whoa, whoa!</i>

02:18.597 --> 02:19.806
Whoa, no, no!

02:19.807 --> 02:21.474
Whoa, whoa!

02:21.475 --> 02:22.767
Whoa, hang on...

02:22.768 --> 02:24.602
So it's come to this, Pollux?

02:24.603 --> 02:26.813
Sacrilege.

02:26.814 --> 02:27.940
Treason.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.567
Death.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.903
No one has to
die here today, Rainey.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.447
Do you know who this is?

02:36.448 --> 02:37.907
<i>Do you?</i>

02:37.908 --> 02:38.826
<i>Come here.</i>

02:39.034 --> 02:39.952
Come here...

02:44.290 --> 02:45.416
Lydia Spring.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.127
Patrick Spring
has the other machine,

02:49.128 --> 02:51.337
the unlimited energy device.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.840
He's waiting for us
at the Perryman Grand right now.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.050
Spring is no longer a threat.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.719
We don't need his other machine.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.222
You have been running
things for too long.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.600
This is a new era.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.602
You have lost the path.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.145
It is time...

03:07.146 --> 03:08.396
for a change--

03:08.397 --> 03:09.398
Enough!

03:09.857 --> 03:12.317
Get the dog.
If he resists, shoot it.

03:12.318 --> 03:13.652
No! No--

03:18.240 --> 03:20.533
I will smash this,
and I will end it,

03:20.534 --> 03:23.662
and you will spend the rest
of your miserable life in that body.

03:25.956 --> 03:26.915
Give me my dog.

03:26.916 --> 03:29.667
Put... the machine... down.

03:29.668 --> 03:30.544
Give me my dog!

03:37.760 --> 03:39.762
You... can't beat me.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.388
Let's go.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.557
Now!

03:44.767 --> 03:47.895
And I will be back
for my goddamn dog!

03:56.612 --> 03:58.113
What was that?

05:08.475 --> 05:11.978
Are you the body that houses
the soul of Jake Rainey?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.187
What are you?

05:13.188 --> 05:14.814
I'm looking for Jake Rainey.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.526
Are you the body that houses
the soul of Jake Rainey?

05:19.570 --> 05:20.738
Yes.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.929
- We're not with them!
- We're on the same side!

05:46.930 --> 05:48.014
Who are you?

05:48.015 --> 05:50.350
Don't you see, Todd?
This has all already happened!

05:50.351 --> 05:52.310
But there's still time to--

05:52.311 --> 05:53.561
Easy--
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:53.562 --> 05:55.521
Who are you,
and what are you doing here?

05:55.522 --> 05:56.814
Dirk, what's going on?

05:56.815 --> 05:58.274
Who is this guy?

05:58.275 --> 05:59.484
I solved the case,

05:59.485 --> 06:01.652
and this is...

06:01.653 --> 06:03.072
Patrick Spring.

06:24.843 --> 06:28.055
Please don't kill us!
I can explain everything.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.436
You go by Patrick Spring now,

06:35.437 --> 06:37.480
but your real name
is Zackariah Webb,

06:37.481 --> 06:38.732
and you made a terrible mistake.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.818
<i>In the 1880s,</i>

06:41.819 --> 06:43.694
<i>you attempted to build
a time machine.</i>

06:45.572 --> 06:47.824
<i>But there was a problem.</i>

06:47.825 --> 06:50.159
<i>At first,
the device only half worked,</i>

06:50.160 --> 06:53.413
<i>it only sent energy through time,
not matter.</i>

06:53.414 --> 06:56.541
<i>It jumped the very souls
right out of the bodies.</i>

06:56.542 --> 06:58.794
<i>This cost you the lives of
many of your beloved pets.</i>

07:01.171 --> 07:03.214
<i>Eventually, you fixed it,
sort of.</i>

07:03.215 --> 07:06.008
<i>You accidentally
sent the machine into the future,</i>

07:06.009 --> 07:07.219
<i>and then, suddenly...</i>

07:08.137 --> 07:09.929
<i>the machine came back,</i>

07:09.930 --> 07:11.973
<i>not exactly the same
as the one you sent.</i>

07:11.974 --> 07:13.225
<i>It had been altered.</i>

07:16.019 --> 07:18.188
<i>Clearly, something had gone
very wrong.</i>

07:23.444 --> 07:25.111
Whatever had happened,
you had to undo it,

07:25.112 --> 07:26.612
so, in your mind,

07:26.613 --> 07:28.490
<i>you only had one option...</i>

07:33.954 --> 07:35.372
<i>Jump to the future.</i>

07:38.584 --> 07:41.670
<i>The machine you used to travel forward
was there in your lab.</i>

07:42.838 --> 07:46.007
<i>But there was no sign
of the original time machine</i>

07:46.008 --> 07:47.884
<i>you accidentally
sent into the future</i>

07:47.885 --> 07:49.218
<i>that started
this whole mess.</i>

07:49.219 --> 07:50.220
<i>You had to find it.</i>

07:52.931 --> 07:54.724
<i>In real time,</i>

07:54.725 --> 07:56.684
<i>more than 80 years
have passed,</i>

07:56.685 --> 07:59.521
<i>and it looks like someone else
is now occupying your mansion.</i>

08:01.523 --> 08:04.317
<i>There are squatters
in the house you abandoned,</i>

08:04.318 --> 08:07.612
<i>a group of hippies led by
a man named Jake Rainey,</i>

08:07.613 --> 08:10.364
<i>and they had your original
time machine.</i>

08:10.365 --> 08:11.574
<i>You say--</i>

08:11.575 --> 08:13.701
<i>"Hey! Give me
that machine back!"</i>

08:13.702 --> 08:15.495
<i>They say, "No,</i>

08:15.496 --> 08:17.038
<i>"this magically appeared
from nowhere,</i>

08:17.039 --> 08:19.665
<i>and is clearly meant for us,
you give us your machine."</i>

08:19.666 --> 08:21.209
<i>"No, you don't even know
what it does!"</i>

08:21.210 --> 08:23.252
<i>"We don't care,
we're super crazy!"</i>

08:23.253 --> 08:24.796
<i>No, give me my machine
right now!"</i>

08:25.714 --> 08:27.256
<i>There's too many of them.</i>

08:27.257 --> 08:29.176
<i>You run,
and it's all very scary.</i>

08:30.010 --> 08:31.552
<i>To fight him, though,</i>

08:31.553 --> 08:33.513
<i>you need money, and resources.</i>

08:33.514 --> 08:36.349
<i>Fortunately,
you're a brilliant inventor,</i>

08:36.350 --> 08:38.142
<i>and you discover a way
to turn your time machine</i>

08:38.143 --> 08:40.228
<i>into an unlimited energy device.</i>

08:40.229 --> 08:41.604
<i>You move into the Ridgely,</i>

08:41.605 --> 08:43.064
<i>take the name Edgar Spring,</i>

08:43.065 --> 08:45.566
<i>and begin to build your empire.</i>

08:45.567 --> 08:47.777
<i>You find the future fascinating.</i>

08:47.778 --> 08:50.112
<i>The advances are irresistible.</i>

08:50.113 --> 08:53.951
<i>Also, you can't leave until you
wrest your machine back from Rainey.</i>

08:54.409 --> 08:56.954
<i>But Ah-hah!
Another wrinkle.</i>

08:57.704 --> 08:59.539
<i>The bad guys had
figured out how to use</i>

08:59.540 --> 09:01.916
<i>what was originally
a glitch in your time machine</i>

09:01.917 --> 09:04.961
<i>to swap souls
into different bodies.</i>

09:04.962 --> 09:08.130
<i>Rainey could literally become
a different person.</i>

09:08.131 --> 09:09.715
<i>He used this ability
to stay young</i>

09:09.716 --> 09:12.969
<i>and grow more powerful,
eventually confronting you.</i>

09:12.970 --> 09:15.972
<i>Rainey said,
"Our group is growing,</i>

09:15.973 --> 09:18.891
<i>"You can't hide it forever.</i>

09:18.892 --> 09:22.144
<i>Just surrender the machine
you're using to make energy."</i>

09:22.145 --> 09:24.480
<i>And then you said,
"I can't do that."</i>

09:24.481 --> 09:27.191
<i>"This is gonna be a war.</i>

09:27.192 --> 09:30.487
<i>Then everything from here on,
the blood is on your hands."</i>

09:33.574 --> 09:36.492
It already was.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.245
You've spent decades
waging a war in secret...

09:39.246 --> 09:40.956
<i>...trying to get ahead of your enemy.</i>

09:42.624 --> 09:45.084
<i>The hippies renamed themselves,
"The Men of the Machine, "</i>

09:45.085 --> 09:47.003
<i>and Rainey made good
on his promise.</i>

09:47.004 --> 09:48.629
<i>It was war.</i>

09:48.630 --> 09:51.507
<i>They wanted your
Unlimited Energy Device,</i>

09:51.508 --> 09:53.217
<i>and you needed to get back
the Time Machine</i>

09:53.218 --> 09:54.760
<i>that was now a Soul Swapper.</i>

09:54.761 --> 09:56.178
<i>But you couldn't get
the upper hand.</i>

09:56.179 --> 09:58.682
<i>Things seemed hopeless.</i>

09:59.725 --> 10:03.561
<i>Your life was dark,
and you were full of rage.</i>

10:03.562 --> 10:05.355
<i>Could you keep living like this?</i>

10:07.816 --> 10:11.027
<i>That's when something
you never expected happened.</i>

10:11.028 --> 10:12.988
<i>You fell in love.</i>

10:13.905 --> 10:15.198
Are you okay?

10:16.158 --> 10:17.658
<i>Lydia was born.</i>

10:17.659 --> 10:20.036
<i>You had a beautiful daughter.</i>

10:20.037 --> 10:22.997
<i>You were happier than you
ever thought you could be.</i>

10:22.998 --> 10:24.041
<i>But then...</i>

10:27.210 --> 10:29.378
<i>terrible tragedy struck.</i>

10:29.379 --> 10:32.131
<i>They killed your wife.</i>

10:32.132 --> 10:35.843
<i>That was the last straw.</i>

10:35.844 --> 10:38.012
<i>You had finally had enough.</i>

10:38.013 --> 10:41.307
<i>You decided to skip
directly to the end.</i>

10:41.308 --> 10:43.643
<i>You jumped to the future,</i>

10:43.644 --> 10:46.521
<i>hopefully to catch your enemies
completely by surprise.</i>

10:53.195 --> 10:55.404
Which is what
led you here, today.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.617
Is that basically
what happened?

11:02.204 --> 11:04.997
How could you possibly
know all that?

11:04.998 --> 11:07.583
- I got it all right?
- How?

11:07.584 --> 11:09.211
Well, it seemed obvious to me--

11:10.337 --> 11:11.797
I have magic powers.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.715
So, wait,
why didn't you just--

11:14.716 --> 11:15.758
Oh, whoa, whoa!

11:15.759 --> 11:17.009
Wh-What's the use
in picking it all apart?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.427
What's done is done,
and that's that,

11:18.428 --> 11:19.595
so great job, I think!

11:19.596 --> 11:21.514
I did the best I could.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.057
Yes, definitely, 100%.
What's crazy about that?

11:23.058 --> 11:24.476
Totally reasonable series
of logical decisions.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.603
We are not the enemy.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.398
We are here
trying to save your daughter.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.235
My daughter?
What's happened to my daughter?

11:35.779 --> 11:38.030
They're taking her
to the Perryman Grand Hotel

11:38.031 --> 11:40.074
to meet you--
the older you--

11:40.075 --> 11:42.577
but listen, there's more elements
at play here than you realize--

11:48.875 --> 11:50.585
Don't get in my way.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.641
Well, that guy certainly
puts the "mad" in mad scientist.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.685
Jesus, he shot the tires out.

12:07.686 --> 12:10.646
We've got to get out of here
before any more of them show up.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.398
Do you know
how to work that thing?

12:12.399 --> 12:13.357
Well, those guys
don't look too bright.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.608
How hard can it be?

12:14.609 --> 12:16.153
Oh, come on, all of them?

12:16.820 --> 12:18.988
Do you think he realizes
this is the day he's murdered?

12:18.989 --> 12:20.448
I mean the other him.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.366
Goddamnit, my brain hurts.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.993
Look, I'm still
figuring it all out myself,

12:23.994 --> 12:27.038
but it's possible that
this is why he was murdered.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.875
Todd, three questions,
one answer.

12:30.876 --> 12:33.627
That's what it means.

12:33.628 --> 12:36.756
We got three maps
that led to one solution.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.049
Zackariah Webb, Edgar Spring,
and Patrick Spring.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.343
Three men are actually
one man jumping through time.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.970
The Unlimited Energy Device,

12:42.971 --> 12:44.388
the Soul Exchanger,
and The Time Machine...

12:44.389 --> 12:46.140
Three machines
are actually one machine,

12:46.141 --> 12:47.224
existing simultaneously,

12:47.225 --> 12:49.059
but out of
chronological sequence--

12:49.060 --> 12:49.935
Wait, wait!

12:49.936 --> 12:51.937
If this is the morning,
then Patrick Spring,

12:51.938 --> 12:54.523
the present Patrick Spring,
isn't dead yet.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.567
Farah's still being held
by those creepy guys, and...

12:56.568 --> 12:58.152
Amanda...

12:58.153 --> 12:59.904
Amanda!

12:59.905 --> 13:02.198
Oh, my God, Dirk, we can fix it!

13:02.199 --> 13:04.158
We can save Lydia Spring
and fix everything!

13:04.159 --> 13:06.744
Well, yes, that was
my plan originally, but--

13:06.745 --> 13:07.870
We've got to get
to the Perryman Grand!

13:07.871 --> 13:09.830
No, wait, Todd--

13:09.831 --> 13:12.333
You defied the Supreme Soul.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.751
You stole the Soul Exchanger.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.003
No. We did!

13:16.004 --> 13:18.214
We stole the Soul Exchanger.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.674
Aren't you tired of being
mindless drones?

13:20.675 --> 13:23.260
Aren't you all tired
of being mindless drones?

13:23.261 --> 13:24.845
Isn't that why you came to me
in the first place?

13:24.846 --> 13:26.806
I tell you, I have plans.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.849
Big plans.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.185
Red here is gonna meet
a guy in the desert

13:31.186 --> 13:33.938
who is going to help us
change everything!

13:33.939 --> 13:35.940
You said that I could
have Rainey's body.

13:35.941 --> 13:39.735
I want one of the good bodies,
like the original souls get.

13:39.736 --> 13:44.698
I am sick and tired of Rainey
treating you like you're disposable,

13:44.699 --> 13:47.409
putting you for years into dogs

13:47.410 --> 13:50.287
and-and birds.

13:50.288 --> 13:53.833
It does something to you,
mentally.

13:53.834 --> 13:57.127
You deserve better than that.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.921
Yes, I also
think that in my head.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.881
I want to be a panther.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.133
I want you to put me
in a panther.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.511
I don't like to be
a human anymore.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.638
You will be a panther.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.891
You will be
a panther, Ed.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.852
Do any of you think

14:12.853 --> 14:15.521
that I want to be
Gordon Rimmer anymore?

14:15.522 --> 14:16.856
No!

14:16.857 --> 14:19.608
We're going to get
both machines.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.235
We're going to get them both,

14:21.236 --> 14:23.863
and all the power
that comes with it,

14:23.864 --> 14:27.241
and then we'll be able to do
whatever the hell we want.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.951
That is what we like
best about you, Gordon,

14:28.952 --> 14:30.745
you always tell us
what we want to hear.

14:31.955 --> 14:32.705
<i>Okay.</i>

14:32.706 --> 14:35.500
Who has the kitten?

14:39.170 --> 14:41.630
Rainey is a coward,
content with the status quo.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.215
But not us.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.800
Not you, not me.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.428
I am the only one with the balls

14:47.429 --> 14:49.890
to use the machine
to create things.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.391
<i>That little kitty cat</i>

14:52.392 --> 14:56.562
is what I call
a weaponized soul.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.730
That's right.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.066
Very dangerous.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.235
<i>You understand.</i>

15:03.778 --> 15:08.949
We only use the kitty cat
as a last resort.

15:11.369 --> 15:15.789
You know what is gonna be
the sweetest thing in the whole deal?

15:15.790 --> 15:18.835
Getting me
my goddamn dog back!

15:21.755 --> 15:24.006
This zoo is huge.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.674
Shit! There's cameras everywhere.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.718
Stay down,
we can't get caught.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.511
Yes, that would be bad.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.221
Look at you,
running around with a crossbow.

15:31.222 --> 15:33.057
You're like an action hero.

15:33.058 --> 15:35.435
Oh, dammit!
Quick, hide!

15:44.861 --> 15:46.737
We don't have time
to sneak through the whole zoo.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.781
We can't just...

15:54.621 --> 15:56.914
Do you realize what this is?

15:56.915 --> 15:58.749
Do you realize
what that is?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.418
It's fate!
It's destiny.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.878
This gorilla mask,

16:02.879 --> 16:04.588
it's just like the one
I saw on the tape.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.423
It's a sign.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.967
These are all signs--

16:07.968 --> 16:09.802
Todd, I don't think
you're thinking this through.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.011
I had a vision, Dirk.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.972
I'm ahead of you for once.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.140
I had a vision of myself
wearing these clothes.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.476
My sister hates me,
I've got no job,

16:17.477 --> 16:18.811
everything I own is destroyed,

16:18.812 --> 16:20.605
but this could change everything.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.649
<i>Hey, is someone back there?</i>

16:24.442 --> 16:25.776
<i>Hello?</i>

16:25.777 --> 16:27.070
<i>Anyone back there?</i>

16:28.321 --> 16:30.280
No, Todd... Todd!

16:30.281 --> 16:32.825
We're time-traveling detectives
on our way to stop a murder!

16:32.826 --> 16:34.743
Get on the ground,
toss the keys away from you!

16:34.744 --> 16:36.037
We're taking your truck!

16:45.380 --> 16:47.006
So much makes sense now.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.716
That's how they got
the shark in the kitten!

16:48.717 --> 16:50.134
They must've soul-swapped it.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.301
Right, perhaps.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.012
How'd they get
a hammerhead shark, though?

16:53.013 --> 16:53.971
They have money.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.557
They steal the bodies
of rich people.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.891
Do you remember
how obsessed

16:57.892 --> 16:59.810
Gordon Rimmer was
with Lux DuJour?

16:59.811 --> 17:01.979
It's because he was
Lux DuJour, right?

17:01.980 --> 17:03.480
Doesn't that make sense?

17:03.481 --> 17:05.315
And that's why
there's been such a tiny response

17:05.316 --> 17:06.734
from the police so far.

17:06.735 --> 17:08.902
They must have people
on the inside!

17:08.903 --> 17:10.112
Right...

17:10.113 --> 17:12.740
That's why everything's
blowing up right now.

17:12.741 --> 17:14.283
I mean, that Gordon Rimmer guy,
like, rebelled,

17:14.284 --> 17:16.035
and then at the same time,

17:16.036 --> 17:18.245
Patrick Spring, like,
shows up from the past,

17:18.246 --> 17:20.080
and, like, annihilates everybody.

17:20.081 --> 17:22.041
It seems like a bunch
of unconnected, spontaneous,

17:22.042 --> 17:25.127
and unlikely coincidences,
but it's not. Right?

17:25.128 --> 17:27.337
Everything
is actually connected!

17:27.338 --> 17:30.090
You're starting to sound
exactly like me.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.301
Holy shit, Dirk,

17:32.302 --> 17:34.471
I get it.
I get everything.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.495
Listen, before we go
into the hotel,

17:59.496 --> 18:01.914
now is the time for us
to take a moment, and think,

18:01.915 --> 18:04.249
really think about
how we're going to do this.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.044
We have a unique opportunity here,

18:07.045 --> 18:08.796
and we need to be careful
how we use it.

18:08.797 --> 18:09.838
It's 9:36.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.340
I didn't get up to the penthouse
until after 10:00.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.425
If we're gonna do this,
we have to go right now.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.094
There's three elevators:
guest, service, and freight.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.386
If we don't want to be seen,

18:16.387 --> 18:18.305
we can go through the loading bay,
and take the service elevator.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.723
If Gordon Rimmer and
his goons are in there,

18:19.724 --> 18:21.391
we need a better plan than that.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.936
You saw the aftermath
of what happened in the penthouse.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.147
<i>or what's going to happen,
or not--</i>

18:27.524 --> 18:29.525
What are you holding?

18:29.526 --> 18:31.860
It's the lottery ticket.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.988
I'm meant to have it.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.949
Or... wait,

18:36.950 --> 18:38.450
if the lottery ticket
is in this truck,

18:38.451 --> 18:39.785
then how-how could--

18:39.786 --> 18:42.037
Todd, never mind,
you were right.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.163
There's no time for this!

18:43.164 --> 18:44.082
Come on!

19:06.229 --> 19:07.147
Whoa!

19:08.857 --> 19:09.898
Shit!

19:09.899 --> 19:11.608
<i>Okay, staff elevator's out.</i>

19:11.609 --> 19:13.735
Uh... we can go in
through the service entrance

19:13.736 --> 19:14.611
and take the freight.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.947
It's slow, but if we hurry,
we can make it in time.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.949
Can you get us
into the penthouse?

19:18.950 --> 19:20.325
Well, no, but--

19:21.411 --> 19:23.162
The master key!
It's in the office.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.746
We can use it
on any room in the hotel.

19:24.747 --> 19:25.665
Masks on.

19:50.857 --> 19:51.858
Look.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.382
Wait, if that's the key--

20:26.267 --> 20:27.852
Stairs?
Stairs.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.465
This isn't my daughter.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.718
You catch on quick.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.137
Where's the machine?

21:04.430 --> 21:07.724
Meeting us
was only half the deal.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.268
You get the machine,
the other machine,

21:09.269 --> 21:11.436
your father's machine,

21:11.437 --> 21:14.773
then you get the soul
that goes with the body.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.276
<i>Your friends
are already dead.</i>

21:16.818 --> 21:21.363
It's all... already over.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.825
What the hell are you
talking about?

21:39.549 --> 21:41.217
I've wasted the time.

21:43.344 --> 21:47.597
Fifteen years
preparing for this moment,

21:47.598 --> 21:49.517
and I still took you for granted.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.657
No, no, no, no, no.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.368
Put the--
put the phone down.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.331
<i>Yes! I was awake.
I've been awake.</i>

22:12.332 --> 22:14.207
Where are you?

22:14.208 --> 22:15.209
It's time.

22:16.586 --> 22:19.504
I'm on my way... is where I am,

22:19.505 --> 22:21.757
and almost there already,
so everything's great.

22:21.758 --> 22:24.009
I said put down
the goddamn phone!

22:24.010 --> 22:25.261
<i>It's too late.</i>

22:26.679 --> 22:27.805
And now...

22:29.057 --> 22:29.848
it's over.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.183
No, it's not--

22:31.184 --> 22:33.310
No, you can still
have your daughter,

22:33.311 --> 22:35.355
you just bring us
the other machine!

22:37.690 --> 22:38.775
Nobody move!

22:42.779 --> 22:43.905
Who the hell are you?

22:46.616 --> 22:48.159
Wait a min...

22:53.956 --> 22:56.166
Don't blame yourself.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.834
<i>It always ended like this.</i>

22:57.835 --> 22:59.002
Shut up!

22:59.003 --> 23:00.879
You would make a deal
with these people?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.382
They killed Catherine!

23:13.851 --> 23:16.520
Jesus Christ!

23:16.521 --> 23:18.772
When you find Lydia,

23:18.773 --> 23:20.525
tell her I loved her.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.110
Tell her I'm sorry.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.445
It never ended any other way.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.696
What?

23:26.697 --> 23:28.115
<i>...And good luck, Dirk.</i>

23:28.116 --> 23:30.033
I'm sorry I hit you.

23:30.034 --> 23:31.368
Who the hell are those guys?

23:31.369 --> 23:33.162
Oh, no...

23:34.038 --> 23:35.039
No, don't!

24:09.740 --> 24:11.826
Come on!
We've got to get out of here!

24:13.619 --> 24:16.372
<i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i>

24:22.587 --> 24:23.462
Oh, Mr. Palacios--

24:23.463 --> 24:25.964
Todd, perfect,
I need you to get to 745--

24:25.965 --> 24:26.965
Yes, I will, I just--

24:26.966 --> 24:29.719
Welcome to the Perryman Grand,
allow us to help you with that.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.639
Hey, stop!

24:34.640 --> 24:36.057
I was wondering
if I could get my check

24:36.058 --> 24:37.225
a little early this month?

24:37.226 --> 24:38.561
What? Why?
Are you okay?

24:44.567 --> 24:46.485
And do me a favor,
check out the penthouse.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.905
They've had a "Do Not Disturb"
since 2:00 p.m. yesterday.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.412
You still have your master key?

24:57.413 --> 24:59.456
No, I... misplaced it.

24:59.457 --> 25:00.290
Take mine.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.835
745, and then the penthouse.

25:03.628 --> 25:04.961
Oh, oh, Jesus Christ.

25:04.962 --> 25:07.088
Come on, come on,
we gotta go.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.050
We gotta go.
Go! Go! Go!

25:18.267 --> 25:20.769
Holy shit.
What the hell just happened?

25:20.770 --> 25:22.688
What did he mean,
"It always ended this way?"

25:25.816 --> 25:26.984
- Dirk?
- Oh, right!

25:29.946 --> 25:31.738
Listen very carefully--

25:31.739 --> 25:32.656
What's happening?

25:32.657 --> 25:34.741
It's a mess up there,
but we're gonna figure it out.

25:34.742 --> 25:35.575
Who's that?

25:35.576 --> 25:38.828
That's your best friend.
Hopefully, he'll forgive us for this.

25:38.829 --> 25:40.580
Listen to me,
he's at the Ridgely Building--

25:40.581 --> 25:41.581
The Ridgely.

25:41.582 --> 25:42.749
What's that guy over there?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.251
<i>No time to explain.</i>

25:44.252 --> 25:46.336
Three questions, one answer,
you understand?

25:46.337 --> 25:47.963
Do you?

25:47.964 --> 25:49.881
Ah! There's no time!

25:49.882 --> 25:51.508
Get the kitten!
We forgot it!

25:51.509 --> 25:53.927
Go! Run!
Don't let them see your face!

25:53.928 --> 25:55.470
Okay! I'm...

25:55.471 --> 25:57.430
I'm going to do something!

25:57.431 --> 25:59.100
Right now!

26:00.226 --> 26:02.103
Come on, we've got
to get out of here! Run!

26:17.118 --> 26:18.827
Calm down, calm down!

26:18.828 --> 26:20.620
It was a loop.
It was a time loop!

26:20.621 --> 26:22.289
You remembered that happening!

26:22.290 --> 26:23.623
That's how you got
the gorilla mask!

26:23.624 --> 26:25.250
It wasn't a coincidence.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.543
That's how you knew
to get the kitten!

26:26.544 --> 26:27.836
Well, no, I didn't
have any context,

26:27.837 --> 26:28.670
I just thought that--
Well, I mean,

26:28.671 --> 26:30.338
once we'd got here,
it was obvious.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.048
Yeah, maybe to someone
reading it in a book,

26:32.049 --> 26:33.091
not when you're living it!

26:33.092 --> 26:34.426
We have to get out
of the hotel--

26:34.427 --> 26:35.802
No! You knew
it was a time machine!

26:35.803 --> 26:37.804
You lied to me.
You lied the whole time,

26:37.805 --> 26:39.014
and now you've screwed
both of us!

26:39.015 --> 26:40.265
No! No! Silence!

26:40.266 --> 26:41.600
No, you shut up!

26:41.601 --> 26:44.102
Don't you say a word,
I don't want to hear it!

26:44.103 --> 26:45.270
Wait...

26:45.271 --> 26:47.230
Holy shit, this is
when it happened.

26:47.231 --> 26:48.190
That means that...

26:54.447 --> 26:55.197
Come on!

27:02.246 --> 27:03.997
What happened?

27:03.998 --> 27:04.664
Where is the machine?

27:04.665 --> 27:06.791
Something went...
really wrong.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.126
Where are the others?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.502
- Someone came in.
- Who?

27:09.503 --> 27:11.755
Just someone! Okay?

27:11.756 --> 27:13.840
<i>Someone got in,</i>

27:13.841 --> 27:17.010
and now Patrick Spring is dead.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.472
What do we do now?

27:20.473 --> 27:21.765
We'll figure it out.

27:21.766 --> 27:24.142
We'll go to the...
we'll go to the reliquary,

27:24.143 --> 27:25.728
We'll find out
what Rainey knows.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.315
We still accomplished something.

27:45.289 --> 27:47.582
Maybe don't throw
all of it away,

27:47.583 --> 27:49.167
we might need some guns...

27:49.168 --> 27:51.628
actually, so...

27:51.629 --> 27:53.588
Right. Sorry.

27:53.589 --> 27:54.590
Okay.

28:02.056 --> 28:04.516
- Who's that?
- That's your best friend.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.184
Hopefully, he'll forgive us for this.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.644
Listen to me,
he's at the Ridgely Building.

28:07.645 --> 28:08.353
The Ridgely.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.064
- Ah!
- Hi!

28:12.733 --> 28:13.650
Whose cat is that?

28:13.651 --> 28:14.734
It's the one
from the crime scene,

28:14.735 --> 28:15.860
<i>the one everyone's
been looking for.</i>

28:15.861 --> 28:17.988
I got you this new shirt
in the gift shop.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.031
I've seen this shirt before.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.450
Three questions, one answer.
Do you understand?

28:22.451 --> 28:24.035
"Three questions,
one answer..."

28:24.036 --> 28:25.912
But how could you
have possibly known that?

28:25.913 --> 28:26.579
It's a map!

28:26.580 --> 28:27.914
But you were there!

28:27.915 --> 28:30.041
- Where?
- At the hotel!

28:30.042 --> 28:32.795
It's a time loop!
You remembered that happening!

28:37.925 --> 28:40.135
You were hit
pretty hard back there.

28:40.136 --> 28:41.804
Are you feeling any better?

28:43.848 --> 28:45.974
My name is...

28:45.975 --> 28:47.435
Dirk Gently.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.145
I'm a detective.

28:50.146 --> 28:50.895
You hired--

28:50.896 --> 28:53.314
Your future self, hired me--

28:53.315 --> 28:55.275
to investigate this whole...

28:55.276 --> 28:57.485
"you dying" incident.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.779
Well, me and him,

28:59.780 --> 29:01.823
we're future us.

29:01.824 --> 29:04.242
We found your time machine,
about a week from now,

29:04.243 --> 29:05.577
and used it to come back here.

29:05.578 --> 29:06.661
<i>Impossible.</i>

29:06.662 --> 29:08.204
When I took the machine
out of Springsborough,

29:08.205 --> 29:09.038
I buried it--

29:09.039 --> 29:09.999
We dug it up.

29:11.167 --> 29:12.834
- Well, how could you--
- You told us how.

29:12.835 --> 29:14.461
You left us a map.

29:14.462 --> 29:17.213
Well, I suppose
you will leave us a map.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.007
Actually, you did a rather
unnecessarily complicated bit

29:19.008 --> 29:20.759
with a map, to a map, to a map,

29:20.760 --> 29:23.511
in a maze that was a bit,
what's the word...

29:23.512 --> 29:24.846
"killy"?

29:24.847 --> 29:26.807
And you are...

29:27.016 --> 29:28.808
Ah.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.728
You are not paying attention.

29:31.187 --> 29:32.563
You have stopped listening.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.441
Right.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.658
You know, we've put
our lives at risk for you,

29:45.659 --> 29:48.703
against an army
of body-swapping psychos,

29:48.704 --> 29:50.246
the least you could do is--

29:50.247 --> 29:52.916
The Men of the Machine aren't
some all-powerful evil empire.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.793
They're buffoons,

29:54.794 --> 29:56.336
greedy imbeciles too stupid to--

29:56.337 --> 29:57.712
Well, it seems
that hasn't stopped them

29:57.713 --> 30:00.173
from hurting a lot of people
while you became a billionaire.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.342
They were so obsessed with
the power they discovered,

30:02.343 --> 30:04.844
they never took the time
to truly understand it.

30:04.845 --> 30:07.430
Well, it seems their blindness
has led to their undoing.

30:07.431 --> 30:09.390
Huh, bit of dramatic irony,
don't you think?

30:09.391 --> 30:12.811
Because that's exactly
what... happened...

30:12.812 --> 30:14.687
to...

30:14.688 --> 30:15.689
you.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.276
Right.

30:19.652 --> 30:20.985
I should have seen that coming.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.071
<i>Hey.</i>

30:23.614 --> 30:25.365
It's not over.

30:25.366 --> 30:27.450
We still have time
to save your daughter.

30:27.451 --> 30:28.785
You're right,

30:28.786 --> 30:30.286
<i>and you two play a part.</i>

30:30.287 --> 30:34.666
When the machine came back,
it had a note on it,

30:34.667 --> 30:36.501
with your name.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.545
My...name?

30:38.546 --> 30:41.047
Yes. Your name,

30:41.048 --> 30:42.299
covered in blood.

30:43.384 --> 30:44.552
Blood?

30:45.302 --> 30:49.138
These tubes tell the machine
which date to travel to.

30:49.139 --> 30:52.100
This tube is programmed to 1886,

30:52.101 --> 30:53.726
the day I sent it forward

30:53.727 --> 30:55.687
and started
this whole bloody mess.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.856
You'll need this tube to send
the time machine you've got

30:57.857 --> 30:59.065
to me in the past.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.942
As far as I'm concerned,
to save Lydia,

31:00.943 --> 31:02.986
all I need to do
is take one more jump.

31:02.987 --> 31:05.321
You're not listening,
that isn't even possible--

31:05.322 --> 31:08.449
The machine I used
is in the socket in my lab.

31:08.450 --> 31:11.244
You use your machine
to go back where you started.

31:11.245 --> 31:13.497
Wait, where's your time machine?

31:15.124 --> 31:18.334
- Aw... nuts.
- We forgot it.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.294
You what?

31:19.295 --> 31:21.421
We forgot the time machine
at the zoo,

31:21.422 --> 31:23.089
at their temple...
thing.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.757
How could you be so stupid?

31:24.758 --> 31:27.760
Hey! Man!
You just killed yourself!

31:27.761 --> 31:29.137
After everything you've done,

31:29.138 --> 31:31.014
you don't get to tell us
how stupid we are.

31:31.015 --> 31:33.474
I'm over it!
I'm over this!

31:33.475 --> 31:35.685
How do you not understand?

31:35.686 --> 31:37.729
You don't win!
This is how it ended.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.606
You don't use
the time machine again

31:39.607 --> 31:41.900
for anything
except to go back home.

31:41.901 --> 31:43.484
"How could you know that?"

31:43.485 --> 31:44.444
'Cause it's obvious!

31:44.445 --> 31:47.113
We just watched an older version
of you die in that hotel room!

31:47.114 --> 31:48.197
You have no idea--

31:48.198 --> 31:51.534
Do I understand exactly
what happened? Hell no.

31:51.535 --> 31:54.329
But I still think I understand
what really matters.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.414
I was waiting
for some big complex pay-off

31:56.415 --> 31:58.583
where you explain everything,

31:58.584 --> 32:01.836
but now I get that you're just
as blind and crazy as everyone else.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.630
You're so obsessed
with one mistake

32:03.631 --> 32:05.632
that you made
a long time ago,

32:05.633 --> 32:08.135
that you can't see all the people
you've hurt along the way.

32:10.387 --> 32:14.307
You can't...
fix everything.

32:14.308 --> 32:17.727
Some choices
you just have to accept,

32:17.728 --> 32:20.688
and try and rebuild
as best you can.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.274
So...

32:23.275 --> 32:24.902
accept it.

32:26.654 --> 32:27.613
I'm sorry.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.825
You're right.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.577
All my inventions,
all this death,

32:34.578 --> 32:36.663
it's all for nothing.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.998
Lydia is the only thing
I have left in this world,

32:38.999 --> 32:41.751
and my foolish, selfish,
short-sighted choices

32:41.752 --> 32:42.836
have left her alone.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.381
I was responsible for her,
and my mistakes,

32:46.382 --> 32:47.633
they've ruined everything.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.477
I'm heading back to 2001.

32:59.269 --> 33:00.980
My daughter needs me.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.822
Certain things can't be changed.

33:13.075 --> 33:14.659
It's you.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.869
It was you all along.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.956
It will always be you.

33:23.711 --> 33:24.753
Please save her.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.132
I will.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.135
Never enough time.

33:32.136 --> 33:33.679
Never enough time
to figure it all out.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.433
Maybe make the maps
less complicated, or...

33:38.434 --> 33:39.600
murdery, or--

33:39.601 --> 33:41.686
He's going to do
whatever he did before.

33:41.687 --> 33:42.646
Right.

33:47.776 --> 33:50.028
It's actually really tragic
when you think about it.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.904
He leaves us here,

33:51.905 --> 33:54.073
returns to the past,

33:54.074 --> 33:57.535
and spends 15 years
preparing for this moment.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.537
By all accounts,

33:59.538 --> 34:01.873
Spring was a distant
father to Lydia,

34:01.874 --> 34:05.043
and even more reclusive.

34:05.044 --> 34:09.297
I suppose seeing yourself die
might do that to you.

34:09.298 --> 34:11.174
So he never won,

34:11.175 --> 34:13.093
never woke up from this dream.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.347
He just ended up trapped
and alone forever.

34:20.059 --> 34:22.060
I'm trying to figure out
what to do next, though.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.437
Do we try
to contact ourselves?

34:24.438 --> 34:26.272
I suppose we can't,
because we didn't, right?

34:26.273 --> 34:27.565
Like...

34:27.566 --> 34:30.151
if we don't remember it,
then it didn't happen,

34:30.152 --> 34:33.780
so it's possible,
or probable, that we...

34:33.781 --> 34:35.865
that we--
If we were to--

34:35.866 --> 34:39.035
The master key was missing
the day of the murder.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.370
I remember now.

34:41.371 --> 34:44.207
It's because
I stole my own key.

34:44.208 --> 34:46.000
And the lottery ticket
that I lost,

34:46.001 --> 34:47.960
I'm the one

34:47.961 --> 34:50.047
who found it in the truck
in the first place.

34:50.923 --> 34:53.175
Everything happened exactly
the way that it did before.

34:57.888 --> 34:59.264
You're a monster.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.059
A monster?

35:03.060 --> 35:05.228
Come on, Todd,
you're overreacting--

35:05.229 --> 35:07.522
You knew what was happening
before you even met me.

35:07.523 --> 35:09.732
When Dorian died.

35:09.733 --> 35:12.443
When they tried to kill me
on the bridge.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.779
When Farah was still
being held in that room.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.656
When that FBI guy
threatened Amanda--

35:16.657 --> 35:18.658
You saw what I said to me,
that wasn't enough to--

35:18.659 --> 35:21.911
No, no, no, when we were almost
crushed to death, and electrocuted,

35:21.912 --> 35:24.288
and burned to death, and shot,

35:24.289 --> 35:25.998
you knew that we'd end up here--

35:25.999 --> 35:28.668
I didn't
know that, exactly.

35:28.669 --> 35:30.503
I didn't have any context--

35:30.504 --> 35:33.297
<i>Oh, and when were you
gonna share that with me, huh?</i>

35:33.298 --> 35:35.049
I just sort of thought
that you left things out

35:35.050 --> 35:38.427
because you were eccentric,
or crazy, or stupid.

35:38.428 --> 35:39.762
But you didn't.

35:39.763 --> 35:42.515
You deliberately
hid things from me.

35:42.516 --> 35:44.684
- You lied to me!
- I didn't lie.

35:44.685 --> 35:45.977
I-I just... didn't tell you
the whole truth

35:45.978 --> 35:47.520
because I didn't
understand it, and--

35:47.521 --> 35:48.646
You're a liar,

35:48.647 --> 35:50.439
and you ruined my life,

35:50.440 --> 35:52.276
just to have a friend.

35:54.778 --> 35:57.072
You deserve to be alone, Dirk.

35:58.907 --> 36:00.993
I didn't lie.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.538
I'd think you of all people know
what a lie looks like by now.

36:07.124 --> 36:09.709
No, wait, that wasn't what I meant,
I'm sorry, I just--

36:09.710 --> 36:11.252
That wasn't what I meant.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.629
After all this is over,

36:13.630 --> 36:15.716
don't ever
speak to me again, Dirk.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.464
Shit.
I hear someone coming.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.133
Get the machine,
we've gotta get out of here.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.134
<i>Hurry up!</i>

37:00.135 --> 37:02.261
Come on! They're coming.

37:02.262 --> 37:04.472
Shit, they're coming!
We have to go. Now!

37:04.473 --> 37:06.015
They obviously
don't catch us, Todd,

37:06.016 --> 37:07.767
or they'd remember us
in the future from the past,

37:07.768 --> 37:10.186
which is currently
the present, so... Right?

37:10.187 --> 37:11.313
What do we do?

37:13.148 --> 37:15.024
What are you doing?

37:15.025 --> 37:16.692
- It worked last time.
- No, it didn't!

37:16.693 --> 37:18.027
Well, we're not dead!

37:18.028 --> 37:19.570
I'll take us
back to the Wild West,

37:19.571 --> 37:21.572
we can stop all of this
before it even began.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.115
Dirk, haven't you been
listening to anything?

37:23.116 --> 37:24.492
- That won't work!
- Get off!

37:24.493 --> 37:27.912
No, we are going back to the future
to save Lydia Spring!

37:27.913 --> 37:29.830
The note with my name
had my blood on it, Todd,

37:29.831 --> 37:31.123
my blood!
I cannot just--

37:31.124 --> 37:32.917
We're not going back
to the Wild West!

37:32.918 --> 37:34.336
- Everything is connected!
- I hate you!

37:44.846 --> 37:46.640
What?

37:48.433 --> 37:49.976
Shit!

37:49.977 --> 37:51.228
Dammit...

37:51.937 --> 37:52.938
No catch.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.150
What's next?

38:00.487 --> 38:01.904
Break the actuator.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.031
Trunk opens.

38:04.491 --> 38:05.659
Maybe.

38:21.508 --> 38:22.551
Wait...

38:38.608 --> 38:39.817
No, no, no.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.111
No, no, no, no!

38:42.321 --> 38:44.281
Fred, get the hell out there,
see what that is!

38:57.044 --> 38:58.045
Run!

39:00.505 --> 39:01.172
Kill them.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.506
Where are you going?

39:02.507 --> 39:04.092
I'm going to check on Rapunzel!

39:04.468 --> 39:06.261
- What's the plan?
- Come on, grab hold!

39:11.975 --> 39:14.352
No, wait...

39:14.353 --> 39:15.312
I can--

39:32.079 --> 39:34.413
Like getting born again.

39:34.414 --> 39:35.915
Getting born...

39:35.916 --> 39:37.542
through this!

39:41.004 --> 39:42.630
Rapunzel?

39:42.631 --> 39:43.839
How did you--

39:43.840 --> 39:44.841
<i>Hey.</i>

39:45.801 --> 39:47.802
Oh, no.

39:47.803 --> 39:48.720
Gordon Rimmer?

39:49.346 --> 39:50.138
'Sup?

40:09.449 --> 40:10.491
Put that dog...

40:10.492 --> 40:12.535
back in that dog!

40:12.536 --> 40:16.038
And that girl...
Back! In that! Girl!

40:16.039 --> 40:17.666
Stop! Stop! Stop--

40:32.722 --> 40:33.889
When are we?

40:33.890 --> 40:35.307
Back where we came from.

40:35.308 --> 40:36.852
Oh, shit.

40:38.437 --> 40:39.354
Oh...

40:41.982 --> 40:42.983
Dirk!
