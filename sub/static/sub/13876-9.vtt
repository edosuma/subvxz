00:56.520 --> 00:57.950
This remote doesn't work.

00:58.020 --> 01:01.680
Just change the battery!

01:01.760 --> 01:02.850
Did you buy any?

01:02.930 --> 01:04.480
l gave you money to buy some.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.860
l opted out of that plan.

01:05.930 --> 01:06.860
You know how l feel about

01:06.930 --> 01:08.800
doing stuff.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.700
My opinions are
well documented

01:11.770 --> 01:13.260
on that particular front.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.100
Fine. Here.

01:15.170 --> 01:16.100
Whoa!

01:16.170 --> 01:17.270
This is over six dollars!

01:17.340 --> 01:18.270
Where did you get all this

01:18.340 --> 01:19.270

01:19.340 --> 01:20.270
Come on outside!

01:20.340 --> 01:21.280
Let's celebrate!

01:21.340 --> 01:22.280
Sorry l got a deadline

01:22.350 --> 01:23.870
to meet.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.280
l bet he's masturbating.

01:25.350 --> 01:26.280
Hey!

01:26.350 --> 01:27.280
What you doing in there?

01:27.350 --> 01:28.280

01:31.760 --> 01:33.020

01:34.090 --> 01:36.420

01:36.490 --> 01:37.430
Oh wait, you don't have one.

01:37.490 --> 01:38.430
Oh, you want to

01:38.500 --> 01:39.860

01:39.930 --> 01:41.660
Well congratulations!

01:41.730 --> 01:42.990
Mission friggin accomplished

01:43.070 --> 01:44.000

01:44.070 --> 01:45.000
Back off.

01:45.070 --> 01:46.130

01:59.980 --> 02:00.920
Frylock what are you doing?

02:00.980 --> 02:01.970
Are you jerking it?

02:02.050 --> 02:02.980

02:03.050 --> 02:05.720
l'm doing!

02:05.790 --> 02:06.720
What's this package

02:06.790 --> 02:07.720
doing out here for you?

02:07.790 --> 02:08.720
Where?

02:08.789 --> 02:09.720
Scoot over!

02:09.789 --> 02:11.230
What are you
doing in here?

02:16.830 --> 02:17.770
Balloons!

02:17.830 --> 02:18.770
Don't touch that!

02:18.840 --> 02:19.770
Thank you!

02:19.840 --> 02:20.930
l can't believe
you remembered!

02:21.000 --> 02:22.030
l mean it's
only five months

02:22.110 --> 02:23.160
away, but still!

02:23.240 --> 02:24.170
This ain't no damn

02:24.240 --> 02:25.300
surprise party for you!

02:25.380 --> 02:27.940
l know, Shake.

02:28.010 --> 02:29.880
lt's for me! Hurray!

02:29.950 --> 02:30.880
Happy birthday to me!

02:30.950 --> 02:31.910
lt's ain't for nobody!

02:31.980 --> 02:32.910
l'm designing a deadly airborne

02:32.980 --> 02:34.110
virus to be compressed with

02:34.180 --> 02:35.450
helium and inserted in balloons

02:35.520 --> 02:36.850
to be passed out at children's

02:36.920 --> 02:38.480
birthday parties!

02:40.660 --> 02:41.590
Oh.

02:41.660 --> 02:42.720
Well, that answers

02:42.790 --> 02:44.320
the dead mice question.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.330
Yeah, l thought that

02:45.400 --> 02:46.450
was a petting zoo.

02:46.530 --> 02:47.460
Okay.

02:47.530 --> 02:49.290
So, this is... Fun for you?

02:49.370 --> 02:50.300
Look, it's just

02:50.370 --> 02:51.730
a freelance gig, okay?

02:51.800 --> 02:52.730
And it pays very well,

02:52.800 --> 02:54.200
so if you'll excuse me,

02:54.270 --> 02:55.200
l have a
video-conference

02:55.270 --> 02:56.800
meeting to attend.

02:56.870 --> 02:57.810
Wow.

02:57.870 --> 02:59.070
There's some serious ethical

02:59.140 --> 03:00.170
implications here.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.570
Oh, now look who's got

03:01.650 --> 03:02.580
a moral compass!

03:02.650 --> 03:03.580
Look, my job is to get

03:03.650 --> 03:04.580
the virus on-line

03:04.650 --> 03:05.580
and not to ask questions.

03:05.650 --> 03:06.580
You got that?

03:06.650 --> 03:08.170
No need to get snappy.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.180
l'm your friend and l'm just

03:09.250 --> 03:10.340
talking to you.

03:10.420 --> 03:11.390
l've found that l can have

03:11.450 --> 03:13.120
a clean conscience,

03:13.190 --> 03:14.590
knowing that l
am unemployed

03:14.660 --> 03:15.920
and unemployable.

03:15.990 --> 03:18.120
No one can make me do anything.

03:18.190 --> 03:19.390
Maybe you should try it.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.360
So to summarize,

03:21.430 --> 03:22.520
this is a birthday party?

03:22.600 --> 03:23.530
Get the fuck outta here!

03:23.600 --> 03:24.530
And don't breathe in!

03:24.600 --> 03:25.530
Or do!

03:25.600 --> 03:27.570
l don't care!

03:27.640 --> 03:28.870
Hey, Raydolph.

03:28.940 --> 03:30.570
ls the package ready?

03:30.640 --> 03:31.570
lt's close. lt's close.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.700
l have a couple more tests.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.710
How did it work

03:33.780 --> 03:35.840
on the Jewish mice

03:35.910 --> 03:36.840
we sent you?

03:36.910 --> 03:37.850
They're Jewish mice?

03:37.910 --> 03:38.850
Jewish, yes,

03:38.920 --> 03:39.970
we converted them.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.540
The males were de-circumcised.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.920
Yeah, l did see that.

03:44.990 --> 03:45.920
But you know the Jewish people

03:45.990 --> 03:47.350
don't do that, right?

03:47.420 --> 03:48.910
Mice do not like monkey-skin

03:48.990 --> 03:51.290
added to the privates.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.520
But no matter.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.650
For they will be dead soon!

03:54.730 --> 03:56.100
Well, no.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.430
They're more, like, asleep.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.970
But it is a deep sleep.

04:00.040 --> 04:00.970
Fryman, this is not

04:01.040 --> 04:02.030
what we asked for.

04:02.110 --> 04:03.040
Well, you only gave me

04:03.110 --> 04:04.040
24 hours.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.700
l can't make them explode --

04:05.780 --> 04:07.170
certainly not from a virus.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.180
But, we thought you could.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.300
Well l can't.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.980
Well, thank you for trying.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.579
Hey, uh, before you go,

04:21.660 --> 04:23.490
l had a quick question.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.650
What is this for?

04:24.730 --> 04:25.890
There are no questions!

04:25.960 --> 04:26.890
You have your money!

04:26.960 --> 04:28.260
Deliver the package at once!

04:28.330 --> 04:29.420
What's that behind you?

04:29.500 --> 04:30.430
ls that a map of lsrael?

04:30.500 --> 04:32.490
l said no questions!

04:32.570 --> 04:33.590
You know what, transmission

04:33.670 --> 04:35.260
over - Fuck you!

04:35.340 --> 04:37.670
The fryman is so stupid.

04:37.740 --> 04:38.730
When l say no questions,

04:38.810 --> 04:40.070
he asks questions immediately,

04:40.140 --> 04:41.580
as if l did not say that.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.580
l clearly said it.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.580
You heard me, right?

04:43.650 --> 04:44.580
C'mon.

04:44.650 --> 04:45.580
Yeah, you said that.

04:45.650 --> 04:46.770
l know l said it.

04:46.850 --> 04:47.780
Ahh!

04:47.850 --> 04:48.880
Turn off these lights!

04:48.950 --> 04:49.880
Get this microphone off me,

04:49.950 --> 04:52.550
l want to play Wolfenstein.

04:52.620 --> 04:55.020
Oh scheisse

04:56.490 --> 04:57.960
Aw hell!

04:58.030 --> 04:59.150
l can't be a part of this!

04:59.230 --> 05:01.250
l told you, it's unethical.

05:01.330 --> 05:02.490
lt's immoral.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.500
l have standards.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.500
Aww hell, what am l

05:04.570 --> 05:05.500
gonna do, Shake?

05:05.570 --> 05:06.500
l'm supposed to make a drop

05:06.570 --> 05:07.500
this afternoon.

05:07.570 --> 05:08.830
Look, don't worry about this.

05:08.910 --> 05:11.470
l'll take care of it.

05:13.340 --> 05:14.280
Ooh!

05:14.340 --> 05:16.210
Did you see how close that was?

05:16.280 --> 05:19.110
All right, just one more putt.

05:21.750 --> 05:22.680
ln and out!

05:22.750 --> 05:23.840
lt was in there!

05:23.920 --> 05:26.290
Just lipped it.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.480
Just one more putt.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.490
Come on Shake!

05:28.560 --> 05:29.490
We're 15 minutes late!

05:29.560 --> 05:30.690
Okay, but l have to sink

05:30.760 --> 05:33.490
one of these before we leave.

05:35.930 --> 05:37.900
Ooh. ln and out.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:47.580 --> 05:49.880
Okay, one more.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.210
l got one more in me.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.440
Just how's this gonna work?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.420
Therein lies the beauty --

05:54.480 --> 05:55.420
it won't.

05:55.490 --> 05:56.470
By the time my sulfur is

05:56.550 --> 05:58.020
released upon the crowd,

05:58.090 --> 05:59.020
they'll know l just had

05:59.090 --> 06:00.390
spicy Asian.

06:00.460 --> 06:01.480
And by then,

06:01.560 --> 06:03.250
we'll be back at our house,

06:03.330 --> 06:04.590
safe and sound.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.060
No no no, we do this,

06:06.130 --> 06:07.190
we gotta leave the country.

06:10.530 --> 06:13.130
Always so negative.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.860
Ah, what a wonderful day

06:14.940 --> 06:16.840
for a balloon!

06:16.910 --> 06:18.070
Here, let me set down

06:18.140 --> 06:19.440
my suitcase full of money

06:19.510 --> 06:22.140
next to you and purchase one.

06:22.210 --> 06:23.940
lt's free of charge, sir.

06:24.010 --> 06:25.780
These balloons are not happy

06:25.850 --> 06:27.180
and floating like we discussed.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.180
They are exactly

06:28.250 --> 06:29.180
what you asked for.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.190
Now if you'll excuse us.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.090
No, l think the product

06:33.160 --> 06:35.090
needs to be tested.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.290
On your kosher friend!

06:37.360 --> 06:38.350
Meatwad!

06:38.430 --> 06:39.360
They took out all my pork

06:39.430 --> 06:40.790
and de-circumsiced me and

06:40.860 --> 06:42.420
give me the dang cowboy hat.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.470
Oy gevalt!

06:43.530 --> 06:44.760
l'm dang Jewish now.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.500
He is Juden.

06:46.570 --> 06:47.500
And now,

06:47.570 --> 06:49.330
he will breathe in deep.

06:49.410 --> 06:53.270
Oy, gefilta fish.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.470
Uh, Shake,

06:54.540 --> 06:55.480
you eat you some Asian?

06:55.550 --> 06:56.480
l found some noodles

06:56.550 --> 06:58.070
in Carl's dumpster, yes.

06:58.150 --> 06:59.110
Liars!

06:59.180 --> 07:00.110
Seize him!

07:00.180 --> 07:02.010
Oh no, Yom Kippur!

07:12.000 --> 07:12.930
Mazel tov.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.430
So...

07:14.500 --> 07:16.430
You have trained well.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.430
Join us.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.430
Hell no.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.100
Then you shall suffer.

07:21.170 --> 07:22.100
Seize him!

07:22.170 --> 07:24.300
Shabbot Shalom!

07:33.080 --> 07:34.010
Hey fellas,

07:34.080 --> 07:35.020
stay out of the grass!

07:35.080 --> 07:36.020
lt's sharp!

07:36.090 --> 07:37.020
Usually, when l take on

07:37.090 --> 07:38.250
a freelance job, l like to know

07:38.320 --> 07:39.250
who l'm dealing with,

07:39.320 --> 07:40.250
but l'll tell you what --

07:40.320 --> 07:41.260
i'm not even gonna bother asking

07:41.320 --> 07:42.260
you why you're a balloon, or why

07:42.330 --> 07:43.260
you hate Jews so much or where

07:43.330 --> 07:44.260
you got all this money.

07:44.330 --> 07:45.260
Where did you get

07:45.330 --> 07:46.260
all this money?

07:46.330 --> 07:47.260
Shake.

07:47.330 --> 07:48.260
1945,

07:48.330 --> 07:49.260
the eagle's nest--

07:49.330 --> 07:51.530
l told you no.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.090
lt's an interesting story.

07:53.170 --> 07:54.100
No. Nope.

07:54.170 --> 07:55.100
Yeah.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.100
Where'd you get all this money?

07:56.170 --> 07:57.230
Your friend wants to know.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.430
Oy gevalt, let the schmuck

07:58.510 --> 07:59.630
tell his story.

07:59.710 --> 08:00.840
Fine, tell your damn

08:00.910 --> 08:03.210
story, Raydolph.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.180
lt's not Raydolph.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.340
lt's Adolf.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.390
As in Hitler!

08:09.450 --> 08:11.890
l'm Hitler!

08:16.830 --> 08:18.020
Raydolph is my screen name.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.650
C'mon you guys, put it together.

08:19.730 --> 08:20.790
Whatever.

08:20.860 --> 08:24.090
1945, the eagle's nest.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.790
Things were, shall we say,

08:25.870 --> 08:28.100
going downhill.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.200
l was so bummed.

08:29.270 --> 08:31.470
l love my swastika tablecloth,

08:31.540 --> 08:33.740
silverware, blood carafe,

08:33.809 --> 08:35.610
knickknacks - so l'm thinking

08:35.679 --> 08:37.150
l will smuggle it all out

08:37.210 --> 08:38.610
of the country in a balloon

08:38.679 --> 08:40.809
up my, shall we say,

08:40.880 --> 08:43.750
personal ''gas chamber.''

08:43.820 --> 08:45.910
Get it?

08:45.990 --> 08:46.920
My ass?

08:46.990 --> 08:47.920
Yeah, we get it.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.020
Say it!

08:49.090 --> 08:51.220
Say what it is!

08:51.290 --> 08:52.920
lt will make you laugh!

08:55.160 --> 08:56.100
Fine, fine l go on with

08:56.170 --> 08:57.560
my story.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.690
So, l try to squeeze it in,

08:59.770 --> 09:01.290
but uh-oh.

09:01.370 --> 09:02.360
Too much, right!

09:02.440 --> 09:03.370
Boom!

09:03.440 --> 09:04.500
l explode from having too much

09:04.570 --> 09:05.870
of my decors and housewares

09:05.940 --> 09:06.870
up my ass!

09:06.940 --> 09:08.040
So, my soul entered this

09:08.110 --> 09:10.010
balloon, and l live on, to

09:10.080 --> 09:12.740
create a perfect race of Aryan

09:12.820 --> 09:15.750
balloons to control the world!

09:17.390 --> 09:18.480
Oh no, Yom Kippur!

09:18.550 --> 09:19.450
That's one dumbass

09:19.520 --> 09:20.450
story, you know that?

09:20.520 --> 09:21.460
You're so funny Frylock,

09:21.520 --> 09:22.460
why don't you make up one

09:22.530 --> 09:23.920
that's better, huh?

09:23.990 --> 09:27.550
C'mon, do it. Right now!

09:27.630 --> 09:29.530
Goldie Hawn is Jewish?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.030
And so is Harrison Ford.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.730
And so is the Wu-tang Clan.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.100
And Ol' Dirty Bastard

09:34.170 --> 09:35.330
and the Rza and The Gza.

09:35.410 --> 09:36.770
No, they're black, Meatwad.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.140
Shlemiel Meshugganah.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.140
So you see,

09:39.210 --> 09:40.440
not every Jew is evil.

09:40.510 --> 09:41.440
Right?

09:41.510 --> 09:42.440
Shake, that's not

09:42.510 --> 09:43.440
the message here.

09:43.510 --> 09:44.450
What about Tom Hanks?

09:44.510 --> 09:45.610
l don't think he's Jewish.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.940
So he hates the Jews?

09:47.020 --> 09:47.950
l doubt it.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.280
l can't speak for Tom Hanks,

09:49.350 --> 09:50.280
but he seems pretty likable.

09:50.350 --> 09:51.290
l doubt that he flat-out

09:51.350 --> 09:52.290
hates Jews.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.980
What about Tom Cruise?

09:54.060 --> 09:55.650
Tom Jews?

09:55.730 --> 09:57.120
He is a scientologist.

09:57.190 --> 09:58.130
They worship aliens.

09:58.190 --> 09:59.560
Lord Xenu is not just

09:59.630 --> 10:02.360
an ''alien,'' Frylock.

10:02.430 --> 10:04.160
He was thrown into a volcano.

10:04.230 --> 10:05.200
You should really study a

10:05.270 --> 10:06.740
little piece of history called

10:06.800 --> 10:09.100
Battlefield Earth, maybe check

10:09.170 --> 10:10.640
your thetan count sometime with

10:10.710 --> 10:11.970
a free audit using our e-meter.

10:12.040 --> 10:12.970
Shake, l don't know how

10:13.040 --> 10:14.010
many times l'm gonna tell you

10:14.080 --> 10:15.010
no about that, okay?

10:15.080 --> 10:16.100
No!

10:16.180 --> 10:17.110
l'm just saying -

10:17.180 --> 10:19.380
We get people off drugs.

10:19.450 --> 10:20.420
We don't kill Jews.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.710
Listen to this Schmuck.

10:21.780 --> 10:22.750
Oy Gevalt.

10:22.820 --> 10:25.880
What about Will Smith?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.550
Big Willie style?

10:27.620 --> 10:28.560
Yeah, does he bounce

10:28.620 --> 10:29.650
into the wild wild west

10:29.730 --> 10:30.720
all lox and bageled?

10:30.790 --> 10:31.730
Look, how about l just

10:31.790 --> 10:32.730
send you the link and you read

10:32.800 --> 10:33.730
it for yourself?

10:33.800 --> 10:34.890
Billy Crystal.

10:34.960 --> 10:35.900
Jerry Seinfeld.

10:35.970 --> 10:36.900
Jerry Seinfeld?

10:36.970 --> 10:37.900
No way!

10:37.970 --> 10:38.900
Jackie Mason?

10:38.970 --> 10:39.900
C'mon!

10:39.970 --> 10:40.900
Next you're gonna say

10:40.970 --> 10:41.900
Rob Reiner - what?

10:41.970 --> 10:43.530
Ben Stiller.
The Beastie Boys.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.200
Bob Dylan.
Adam Sandler.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.210
All Jewish.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.210
The guy who's
the waterboy?

10:47.280 --> 10:50.640
But l love
The Waterboy!

10:50.710 --> 10:53.240
So, not only do l not hate

10:53.320 --> 10:55.550
the Juden,
but l'm one

10:55.620 --> 10:56.980
of their
biggest fans?

10:57.050 --> 10:59.990
lt would seem
that way, yes.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.520
Well then come here,

11:01.590 --> 11:03.180
my Hebrew brother.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.730
l am so sorry for misjudging

11:04.790 --> 11:05.990
you and your talented

11:06.060 --> 11:07.550
Mongrel race.

11:07.630 --> 11:09.060
Well, Mazel Tov l guess.

11:09.130 --> 11:10.060
Yeah.

11:10.130 --> 11:11.070
Matzo ball.

11:11.130 --> 11:12.070
Embrace me,

11:12.140 --> 11:13.300
and we will
work together

11:13.370 --> 11:14.840
to put our
differences aside

11:14.900 --> 11:16.700
so we may
once and for all,

11:16.770 --> 11:19.000
destroy the gays!

11:19.080 --> 11:22.840
Heil, the
inflatable Hitler!

11:22.910 --> 11:24.380
Wow.
Gelfilte fish.
