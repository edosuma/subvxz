but if you would sleep home

05:42.107 --> 05:44.708
one night instead
of staying at his house,

05:44.709 --> 05:53.917
you would be here
helping me instead of me...

05:53.918 --> 05:55.285
I did.

06:16.975 --> 06:18.676
I didn't even do anything.

06:23.415 --> 06:24.881
I'm turning the car around.

06:24.882 --> 06:25.817
That's what we're doing,
I'm turning around.

06:26.017 --> 06:26.657
We're not going.

06:26.785 --> 06:27.951
Yeah, right.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.386
We're not even going anywhere.

06:29.387 --> 06:31.254
There's just millions
of cars in our way.

06:31.255 --> 06:32.925
You lost that one.

07:00.786 --> 07:01.518
What the...

07:01.519 --> 07:02.686
I need to...

07:02.687 --> 07:03.453
Go ahead.

07:03.454 --> 07:04.770
No, what were you saying?

07:04.988 --> 07:07.725
I was just wonderin'
what the hell was goin' on here.

07:07.726 --> 07:09.601
Torture.

07:16.368 --> 07:17.368
What are you doing?

07:17.369 --> 07:18.302
Gettin' comfortable.

07:18.303 --> 07:19.270
You can't do that.

07:19.271 --> 07:20.371
What if we start to move?

07:20.372 --> 07:21.272
We're not goin' anywhere.

07:21.273 --> 07:22.205
But what if we start to?

07:22.206 --> 07:22.740
Well, then I'll go!

07:22.940 --> 07:26.576
I need to...

07:26.577 --> 07:28.746
I just really need
to not be here right now.

07:28.747 --> 07:30.280
Yeah, well...

07:30.281 --> 07:32.850
if you woulda snuck out
like any decent one night stand,

07:32.851 --> 07:34.586
we wouldn't be, right?

07:41.425 --> 07:43.393
I can feel you
staring, you know.

07:43.394 --> 07:45.797
Sorry.

07:49.334 --> 07:50.701
This is ridiculous.

07:50.702 --> 07:53.175
Everyone's turning
off their engines.

07:58.175 --> 08:00.714
There better be a big
wreck up there.

08:02.714 --> 08:04.314
What did you just say?

08:04.315 --> 08:05.616
What, if my time's being wasted,

08:05.617 --> 08:09.587
I'd like it to be
for a good reason.

08:09.588 --> 08:12.722
Oh, you are kinda dark.

08:12.723 --> 08:16.059
What, a little twisted
up metal never hurt anyone.

08:16.060 --> 08:19.429
No, I'm actually pretty sure
that that is the exact

08:19.430 --> 08:22.266
type of thing that hurts people.

08:22.267 --> 08:24.135
It's just that there's
nothing worse than

08:24.136 --> 08:26.537
when traffic lifts
for no reason.

08:26.538 --> 08:28.205
Except for maybe, you know,
wishing somebody

08:28.206 --> 08:29.607
getting in a car accident.

08:29.608 --> 08:30.741
There's that.

08:30.742 --> 08:32.442
Is it so wrong
to want a little evidence

08:32.443 --> 08:34.278
to justify all this
as opposed to,

08:34.279 --> 08:36.580
"Oh, you're just freed up,"
and you don't even know why

08:36.581 --> 08:38.181
you were stuck
in the first place.

08:38.182 --> 08:40.383
I'm sorry, but a giant fire
would make it

08:40.384 --> 08:42.753
at least worthwhile.

08:42.754 --> 08:46.389
Okay.

08:46.390 --> 08:49.062
There's gotta be
a science behind traffic, right?

08:51.062 --> 08:52.729
Don't ya think?

08:52.730 --> 08:55.499
No, I don't.

08:55.500 --> 08:59.403
I do, a lot, actually.

08:59.404 --> 09:01.305
You know, it's like,
none of that makes sense,

09:01.306 --> 09:03.474
you know, like it kinda...

09:03.475 --> 09:05.375
Kick off your shoes,
it's gonna be awhile,

09:05.376 --> 09:07.077
and talk to your neighbor,
and please,

09:07.078 --> 09:09.245
keep the road rage
to a minimum, folks.

09:09.246 --> 09:12.282
It's a fucking Sunday, people!

09:12.283 --> 09:15.319
Heading north down to the south
bound 406 double lane road.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.988
Both directions,
all the way up the highway

09:16.989 --> 09:18.321
and down the interstate.

09:18.322 --> 09:20.124
Turns out, sorry,
there is no reason,

09:20.125 --> 09:22.994
but, as soon as we hear...

09:22.995 --> 09:25.696
It can't just be cause
of some guy who slams

09:25.697 --> 09:27.831
on his brakes to stare
at some ducks,

09:27.832 --> 09:30.267
or 'cause he spills
a Slurpee on himself.

09:30.268 --> 09:31.828
There's gotta be
a mathematical equation

09:32.004 --> 09:33.771
to all of this, right?

09:33.772 --> 09:35.773
I think about guys
who get into the carpool lane,

09:35.774 --> 09:37.307
even though that's
going slower than

09:37.308 --> 09:40.143
the normal traffic.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.479
Makes no sense.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.879
Oh, my God, there better
be a dead body up there,

09:42.880 --> 09:44.949
because I just can't
take this anymore.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.082
Now, somebody has to die?

09:46.083 --> 09:47.652
Yeah, they do, thanks to you.

09:47.653 --> 09:48.820
Why don't we just go
all the way and just say

09:49.020 --> 09:50.821
somebody loses their head.

09:50.822 --> 09:51.922
That'll be fun.

09:51.923 --> 09:53.556
Put that out in the world.

09:53.557 --> 09:56.400
Somebody gets decapitated,
so it'll be worth your time.

09:59.364 --> 10:02.199
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.702
We have that in common.

10:05.703 --> 10:07.904
It's true.

10:07.905 --> 10:08.939
Totally true.

10:08.940 --> 10:10.608
What's that?

10:10.609 --> 10:12.188
Oh, you know, it's just easier

10:13.010 --> 10:16.881
to have sex with a stranger
than converse with one.

10:18.115 --> 10:19.282
What?

10:19.283 --> 10:21.051
You want me deep inside you?

10:21.052 --> 10:23.119
I want you inside me so deep.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.354
Yeah?

10:24.355 --> 10:25.189
Oh.

10:25.190 --> 10:26.257
Give it to me.

10:26.258 --> 10:27.925
You give it to me.

10:27.926 --> 10:29.793
Wait.

10:29.794 --> 10:31.362
Don't you want me
to give it to you?

10:31.363 --> 10:33.196
Yeah, yeah,
just put it in already.

10:33.197 --> 10:33.765
Okay, okay.

10:33.965 --> 10:35.132
Okay.

10:35.133 --> 10:36.934
You like that?

10:39.937 --> 10:41.705
You're screwing the blanket.

10:41.706 --> 10:43.807
What?

10:43.808 --> 10:44.808
Good try.

10:46.778 --> 10:49.213
I can't feel anything
with this thing on.

10:49.214 --> 10:52.249
Okay, I told you
you couldn't get it in.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.152
I guess that is what she said.

11:17.008 --> 11:19.343
Well, I guess they don't
call it a one night stand

11:19.344 --> 11:22.646
and the morning after
for a reason, right?

11:22.647 --> 11:24.515
What are you doing?

11:26.384 --> 11:29.187
Fuck.

11:31.423 --> 11:33.224
Do you need any help?

11:33.225 --> 11:34.625
I'm fine.

11:36.227 --> 11:37.894
I'm fine.

11:37.895 --> 11:39.663
Oh, man, that's nasty.

11:42.734 --> 11:43.868
What is she doing?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.669
You let that all out, honey.

11:48.005 --> 11:49.639
Fuckin' bullshit!

11:49.640 --> 11:50.874
You disappoint me.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.139
You're better than that.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.859
If it's any consolation,
I have that affect

12:09.860 --> 12:12.562
on all women.

12:12.563 --> 12:15.532
You don't have to try
to be charming or...

12:15.533 --> 12:17.301
funny right now.

12:17.302 --> 12:19.910
I'm perfectly fine.

12:49.067 --> 12:51.268
Are you sure I can't
do anything?

12:51.269 --> 12:53.085
I'm fine!

13:07.085 --> 13:09.052

You want me deep inside you?

15:11.076 --> 15:12.909
I want you inside me so deep.

15:12.910 --> 15:14.077
Yeah?

15:14.078 --> 15:15.178
Oh.

15:15.179 --> 15:16.312
Give it to me.

15:16.313 --> 15:19.583
You give it to me.

15:22.419 --> 15:25.955
So, you're a florist, right?

15:25.956 --> 15:27.758
Attorney.

15:27.759 --> 15:29.093
Right.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.798
It's a shame,
I really like flowers.

15:33.798 --> 15:36.800
To think I could be
sitting in a cab right now.

15:36.801 --> 15:38.134
You're such a nice guy.

15:38.135 --> 15:39.135
Wow.

15:39.136 --> 15:40.537
I'm sorry.

15:40.538 --> 15:42.272
No, I'm... I'm just
impressed that you

15:42.273 --> 15:44.374
remembered my name.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.877
You were more
sober than I thought.

15:46.878 --> 15:48.077
Was I?

15:48.078 --> 15:49.812
Yeah, 'cause...

15:49.813 --> 15:52.018
oh, you just meant, guy,
like I'm a guy.

15:52.727 --> 15:53.938
No, 'cause that's my...

15:53.952 --> 15:54.984
Right, Guy!

15:54.985 --> 15:55.619
Yeah.

15:55.620 --> 15:56.286
Guy.

15:56.287 --> 15:59.089
See how that worked?

15:59.090 --> 16:00.758
Well, I guess I just
got lucky with that one.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.130
It happens.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.464
It's a pleasure to meet you.

16:07.465 --> 16:09.066
Oh.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.834
Sara.

16:10.835 --> 16:12.036
Sara.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.670
Sara.

16:13.671 --> 16:16.340
Oh.

16:16.341 --> 16:20.476
So, what kind of
an attorney are you, Sara?

16:20.477 --> 16:23.547
I do international,
commercial arbitration.

16:23.548 --> 16:24.715
Oh, cool.

16:24.716 --> 16:27.417
What jurisdiction?

16:27.418 --> 16:28.819
You have no idea what I do.

16:28.820 --> 16:29.853
Nope, not in the slightest.

16:29.854 --> 16:32.056
No.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.389
I deal with dispute
resolution over

16:33.390 --> 16:36.793
international sale of goods.

16:36.794 --> 16:38.162
I'm an accountant.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.497
I do people's taxes.

16:40.498 --> 16:42.066
Well, that's easier.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.200
Yeah.

16:43.201 --> 16:44.201
To explain.

16:44.202 --> 16:46.873
Sure, I know what you meant.

16:48.873 --> 16:52.142
I think I hired a lawyer
for a traffic ticket one time.

16:52.143 --> 16:53.777
Oh yeah, how'd that
work out for ya?

16:53.778 --> 16:56.913
It was like 140 bucks
for a 10 minute phone call.

16:56.914 --> 16:57.748
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:57.749 --> 16:59.082
You got off cheap.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.284
It was dismissed before
you could even do anything.

17:01.285 --> 17:03.686
I woulda charged you double.

17:03.687 --> 17:05.255
Really?

17:05.256 --> 17:07.056
Just when I was likin' ya.

17:07.057 --> 17:08.724
Tell me you're being sarcastic.

17:08.726 --> 17:09.826
What can I say.

17:09.827 --> 17:12.694
You can take the girl
out of Brooklyn, but...

17:12.695 --> 17:13.765
Brooklyn?

17:14.531 --> 17:15.699
I like Brooklyn.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.133
I think I have
some family up there.

17:17.134 --> 17:18.935
Yeah, everybody does.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.276
I can't get it in.

17:26.277 --> 17:27.678
That's what she said.

17:27.679 --> 17:29.364
Oh my God, really,
with that one?

17:30.013 --> 17:31.181
Whoops!

17:31.182 --> 17:33.049
You're leanin' on my doorbell.

17:33.050 --> 17:34.050
Wow.

17:35.019 --> 17:37.187
Look at that.

17:37.188 --> 17:41.057
The city is gorgeous!

17:41.058 --> 17:42.992
Oh my gosh.

17:42.993 --> 17:45.962
I love the sound of ambulances.

17:45.963 --> 17:48.297
It's so soothing.

17:48.298 --> 17:52.069
Reminds me of home.

17:54.071 --> 17:57.607
Give me a tour.

17:57.608 --> 17:59.942
This is it.

17:59.943 --> 18:02.546
Oh, my God.

18:02.547 --> 18:05.249
Really?

18:05.250 --> 18:08.755
Well, give it a whirl
before ya judge.

18:10.755 --> 18:11.822
Oh.

18:11.823 --> 18:13.356
That's real money in there.

18:13.357 --> 18:17.193
Okay, this is awesome.

18:17.194 --> 18:19.563
Ooh, you play?

18:19.564 --> 18:21.698
Oh, yeah.

18:21.699 --> 18:24.934
Oh, oh...

18:24.935 --> 18:26.569
it's loud.

18:26.570 --> 18:28.604
Oh, sorry.

18:28.605 --> 18:30.574
And the neighbors.

18:30.575 --> 18:32.644
Oh.

18:36.346 --> 18:39.092
That is some hot ass music.

18:48.092 --> 18:50.028
Look at that.

18:51.028 --> 18:53.764
Where was this taken?

18:53.765 --> 18:55.499
That.

18:55.500 --> 18:59.670
That...

18:59.671 --> 19:01.006
I don't know.

19:02.006 --> 19:03.105
You don't know?

19:03.106 --> 19:04.775
I don't know, I have no idea.

19:04.776 --> 19:09.947
But, I prefer it that way,
you know, 'cause then it's mine,

19:09.948 --> 19:11.782
wherever I want it to be.

19:17.188 --> 19:20.923
Yeah, but I would
still wanna know, you know?

19:20.924 --> 19:22.925
It's in your home.

19:22.926 --> 19:23.893
Right.

19:23.894 --> 19:25.996
Ooh, old school, I love it.

19:25.997 --> 19:26.997
Can I play it low?

19:26.998 --> 19:28.364
Yeah.

19:28.365 --> 19:29.865
But you have to play
it really low, please.

19:29.866 --> 19:31.546
Okay.

19:47.384 --> 19:51.721
Oh, oh, listen to that crackle.

19:51.722 --> 19:56.425
Oh, you just don't get that
on nineteens, you know?

19:56.426 --> 19:59.695
Well, glad you appreciate it.

19:59.696 --> 20:02.132
Totally.

20:02.133 --> 20:03.200
How can you not, though?

20:03.201 --> 20:07.104
It's just so damn...

20:07.105 --> 20:08.373
sexy.

20:13.944 --> 20:15.645
Look at this place.

20:15.646 --> 20:17.848
You've done pretty
good for yourself?

20:23.621 --> 20:27.923
This is like
the softest carpet ever!

20:27.924 --> 20:29.028
This is amazing.

20:30.028 --> 20:33.396
Ooh.

20:33.397 --> 20:35.531
Oh, I love this carpet.

20:35.532 --> 20:38.868
I just wanna have sex with it.

20:38.869 --> 20:42.271
Where'd you say
you were from again?

20:42.272 --> 20:45.342
Don't you think that
we're way passed that

20:45.343 --> 20:48.812
get to know you chit chat
phase, Greg?

20:48.813 --> 20:50.681
It's Guy.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.615
Still.

20:52.616 --> 20:55.919
You know, we just never
got around to any of that.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.387
There's just one,
teensy-weensy little thing

20:58.388 --> 21:00.723
you need to know about me.

21:00.724 --> 21:02.558
What's that?

21:02.559 --> 21:06.195
Are you gonna take me like this,

21:06.196 --> 21:09.766
or like this?

21:09.767 --> 21:10.801
Oh.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.740
I'm gonna...

21:17.741 --> 21:19.375
I'm gonna...

21:19.376 --> 21:21.448
make us some drinks.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.315
Well, that works, too.

21:25.316 --> 21:31.054
I think I have vodka,
a little bit of tequila.

21:31.055 --> 21:33.422
So...

21:33.423 --> 21:38.327
how many ladies have you had out
on that balcony?

21:38.328 --> 21:41.631
That is none of your business.

21:41.632 --> 21:42.900
Zero.

21:44.167 --> 21:47.738
Okay.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.105
We're gonna do vodka.

21:49.106 --> 21:50.574
Just bring out the bottle.

21:50.575 --> 21:52.209
I don't need a fancy drink

21:52.210 --> 21:56.145
with a twist in it
or anything like that.

21:56.146 --> 21:58.815
So, I have...

21:58.816 --> 22:01.284
cranberry and cranberry.

22:01.285 --> 22:03.620
I'm taking this carpet
home with me.

22:03.621 --> 22:04.621
Right, okay.

22:04.622 --> 22:07.056
I will, too.

22:07.057 --> 22:08.458
You have really good taste.

22:08.459 --> 22:09.526
It's really neat in here.

22:09.527 --> 22:10.861
Are you sure you're not gay?

22:10.862 --> 22:14.432
You are makin' this
very hard on me.

22:42.226 --> 22:43.125
I just...

22:43.126 --> 22:43.926
I need to use the...

25:16.012 --> 25:17.980
What?

25:17.981 --> 25:19.348
Nothin'.

25:19.349 --> 25:20.650

25:23.954 --> 25:26.922
Yeah, if I had mine,
we could text each other.

25:26.923 --> 25:27.824
That'd be fun.

25:27.825 --> 25:29.695
Yeah, that must suck.

25:31.525 --> 25:33.262
Went on a date once
with this girl

25:33.263 --> 25:35.297
that texted the entire time.

25:35.298 --> 25:36.932
It was so annoying.

25:36.933 --> 25:38.035
Rude.

25:41.672 --> 25:45.107
Okay, I'm gonna go find out

26:36.961 --> 26:39.496
So, I got a bit of bad news.

26:39.497 --> 26:41.765
Unfortunately,
I didn't see any sign

26:41.766 --> 26:43.098
of a car wreck.

26:43.099 --> 26:45.501
But, that's not to say
that further down the line

26:45.502 --> 26:48.505
there's not like
mass carnage everywhere.

26:48.506 --> 26:50.739
Oh, well I'll keep
my fingers crossed.

26:50.740 --> 26:53.075
Oh, I ran into
a couple cops, also stuck,

26:53.076 --> 26:56.179
that politely told me
to stay the hell in my car.

26:56.180 --> 26:58.786
So, status quo then.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.820
It appears so.

27:04.821 --> 27:08.124
Another vibrating device
that men have to compete with.

27:08.125 --> 27:11.260
How fun.

27:11.261 --> 27:13.314
Just so you know,
I wrote the letter "U"

27:14.030 --> 27:17.100
as opposed to the word
"y-o-u" in a brief recently,

27:17.101 --> 27:19.235
so that would be
the effect of texting.

27:19.236 --> 27:21.438
Total butchering
of the English language.

27:21.439 --> 27:22.971
O-M-G!

27:22.972 --> 27:26.976
Thank God for spell check.

27:26.977 --> 27:28.278
You're quick.

27:28.279 --> 27:29.312
When I have to be.

27:29.313 --> 27:30.713
Why, is that surprising?

27:30.714 --> 27:33.516
Under this circumstance,
yeah, it's not typical.

27:33.517 --> 27:36.452
What, only stupid girls
are allowed to go home

27:36.453 --> 27:37.854
with some random dude?

27:37.855 --> 27:40.723
Just me, usually, I mean...

27:40.724 --> 27:42.525
I wouldn't judge
a girl's intellect

27:42.526 --> 27:44.861
based on her life choices
while under the influence

27:44.862 --> 27:45.961
of a margarita.

27:45.962 --> 27:48.397
Whose margarita?

27:48.398 --> 27:49.504
Yeah, that was great.

27:49.787 --> 27:51.735
You know what,
you go ahead and judge.

27:51.736 --> 27:52.902
All right.

27:52.903 --> 27:53.937
Are you serious?

27:53.938 --> 27:56.338
Texting, this fucking texting!

27:56.339 --> 27:57.806
It's ruining the world.

27:57.807 --> 27:59.476
Honestly, who the hell
needs to get a hold of you

27:59.477 --> 28:02.412
at eight A.M.
on a Sunday morning?

28:02.413 --> 28:04.015
Nobody.

28:05.015 --> 28:08.819
Somebody, boyfriend maybe?

28:09.540 --> 28:11.488
Well, I hope he's not
the jealous type

28:11.489 --> 28:15.557
because I am a lover,
not a fighter.

28:15.558 --> 28:16.726
Yup.

28:16.727 --> 28:18.627
You know, I'm really not
the type to impede

28:18.628 --> 28:20.997
on somebody else's happiness,
so I think that we should

28:20.998 --> 28:23.098
probably just end this
right now.

28:23.099 --> 28:24.500
Oh, well, I understand.

28:24.501 --> 28:27.036
Don't be so broken up about it.

28:27.037 --> 28:30.105
I'm not.

28:30.106 --> 28:32.741
Well, it makes sense though.

28:32.742 --> 28:36.179
You don't really seem like the
single type, not sober, anyway.

28:36.180 --> 28:38.081
What single type?

28:38.082 --> 28:39.848
There's a type, you know?

28:39.849 --> 28:42.751
You know, there's a certain
charm, there's a certain spark.

28:42.752 --> 28:45.154
- That I'm lacking.
- There's a spark.

28:45.155 --> 28:47.289
Constantly looking,
zigzagging around.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.225
Interested in other people.

28:49.226 --> 28:50.794
What, you don't have
any married friends?

28:50.795 --> 28:53.062
- All my friends are married!
- Oh, okay.

28:53.063 --> 28:54.764
Well, you should ask them.

28:54.765 --> 28:56.799
I mean, that's why I'm invited
to all their parties,

28:56.800 --> 28:58.835
so they can watch all
the flirtiness go down

28:58.836 --> 29:01.504
and not be bored.

29:01.505 --> 29:03.539
- That's messed up.
- Right?

29:03.540 --> 29:06.108
Think about that the next time
you and your boyfriend

29:06.109 --> 29:09.882
have people over.

29:11.882 --> 29:15.418
So, what's his deal?

29:15.419 --> 29:17.720
Is he a lawyer, too?

29:17.721 --> 29:20.890
He's 6'3", all muscle,
black belt in taekwondo.

29:20.891 --> 29:22.558
Don't worry, I think that he
finally understands

29:22.559 --> 29:25.865
that we're seeing other people.

29:27.865 --> 29:31.300
My vote is that you take me
home with you.

29:31.301 --> 29:34.170
Oh, is that right?

29:34.171 --> 29:36.406
And do dirty things to me.

29:41.278 --> 29:43.547
Somebody agrees with me.

29:48.519 --> 29:51.921
Well, that somebody doesn't
always make the best decisions.

29:51.922 --> 29:54.524
Seems pretty smart to me.

29:54.525 --> 29:56.793
Oh, God.

29:56.794 --> 29:58.161
You are bad.

29:58.162 --> 30:01.698
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, you are bad.

30:01.699 --> 30:06.501
I know it when I see it
and you are bad.

30:06.502 --> 30:08.008
Good.

30:11.008 --> 30:14.576
Oh, you're gonna make me
do things I shouldn't.

30:14.577 --> 30:19.515
And I'll make you do things
that you thought you couldn't.

30:19.516 --> 30:21.517
Wait, you're not gonna
take me home

30:21.518 --> 30:23.353
and chop me into little pieces,
are you,

30:23.354 --> 30:25.776
'cause I'm not really in
to that kind of thing?

30:26.022 --> 30:28.391
You're not?

30:28.392 --> 30:31.928
Okay, I think you're sexy...

30:31.929 --> 30:33.863
...relatively.

30:33.864 --> 30:35.431
Oh, wow.

30:35.432 --> 30:38.066
You just got me a little wet.

30:38.067 --> 30:41.437
- Oh, my god.
- Excuse me, sir?

30:41.438 --> 30:43.944
Sir?

30:47.944 --> 30:49.913
I don't know about this.

30:54.117 --> 30:55.318
Hey?

31:11.000 --> 31:14.537
Your boyfriend's calling.

31:14.538 --> 31:16.204
It's not my boyfriend.

31:16.205 --> 31:18.807
- Oh, does he know that?
- Oh, my god.

31:18.808 --> 31:20.442
Can you do something
to get us moving?

31:20.443 --> 31:22.077
- I mean, really.
- And what would you suggest?

31:22.078 --> 31:23.947
I don't know, it's just...

31:23.948 --> 31:26.415
What, is the President
in town or something?

31:26.416 --> 31:28.183
You know, it may not be
my place to say,

31:28.184 --> 31:30.752
but what's up with this guy,
gettin' you all freaked out?

31:30.753 --> 31:33.556
It's not a guy,
it's my crazy sisters, okay?

31:33.557 --> 31:35.525
We were supposed to meet up
and whenever we have a plan,

31:35.526 --> 31:38.227
my whole world
has to revolve around it.

31:38.228 --> 31:40.162
I just thought we'd be
out of here by now,

31:40.163 --> 31:42.765
so I don't know what to type.

31:42.766 --> 31:45.034
Why don't you try
typing the truth?

31:45.035 --> 31:49.505
What, "Hey guys, I had sex with
some random stranger last night

31:49.506 --> 31:51.441
and I won't be able to make
our morning brunch after all

31:51.442 --> 31:53.375
'cause I'll be stuck
in the drive of shame

31:53.376 --> 31:57.246
and forced to make chit-chat
for God knows how much longer."

31:57.247 --> 31:58.914
So, is that what
you want me to write?

31:58.915 --> 32:00.549
That sounds about right.

32:00.550 --> 32:03.353
My phone would explode, we don't
have that kind of relationship.

32:03.354 --> 32:06.722
Really, I tell
my dad everything?

32:06.723 --> 32:08.357
He's gonna get a kick
out of this shit.

32:08.358 --> 32:10.226
I'm so glad my nightmare
makes for a good story.

32:10.227 --> 32:12.060
Oh, now, don't take all
the credit.

32:12.061 --> 32:13.895
It's my nightmare, too.

32:13.896 --> 32:17.566
I'll just tell them
I'm not feeling well.

32:17.567 --> 32:20.502
Oh, my god, I have to get
the hell out of here!

32:20.503 --> 32:24.039
Wow, you know, I'm getting
a really, like, over bearing,

32:24.040 --> 32:26.174
clingy vibe from you right now.

32:26.175 --> 32:28.044
- You are so not funny.
- It's cool.

32:28.045 --> 32:30.712
I've never actually really
had a stalker, this is fun.

32:30.713 --> 32:33.583
If it wasn't five miles
in heels, I would be walking.

32:33.584 --> 32:36.552
I'm all for the women
empowerment thing, right,

32:36.553 --> 32:38.954
but don't let the after sex
cuddle chemicals

32:38.955 --> 32:40.856
go to your head.

32:40.857 --> 32:44.326
You'd have to make me orgasm
to release oxytocin,

32:44.327 --> 32:46.362
so don't worry,
you're in the clear, buddy.

32:46.363 --> 32:50.165
Ouch, wow, you are ruthless.

32:50.166 --> 32:52.101
I bet you're really good
at what you do.

32:52.102 --> 32:53.736
When I have to be.

32:53.737 --> 32:56.572
Why don't we just listen
to some music?

32:56.573 --> 32:59.441
- To the 808 show on KSOC...
- Can you just...

32:59.442 --> 33:01.743
Okay, I'm just...
I'm getting there.

33:01.744 --> 33:04.814
Give me three seconds to get out
of talk radio.

33:04.815 --> 33:06.816
Well now, it's just skipping,
it's skipping.

33:06.817 --> 33:08.918
You have to stop
pressing the button.

33:08.919 --> 33:10.385
It's static, you like that?

33:10.386 --> 33:12.722
You wanna listen to some static
for a while?

33:16.192 --> 33:17.593
Just change it, okay?

33:17.594 --> 33:19.394
All right, I'll change it,
there we go.

33:19.395 --> 33:21.096
There we go, more talk radio.

33:21.097 --> 33:23.132
Well, stop pushing the button.

33:23.133 --> 33:24.700
You passed a good song.

33:24.701 --> 33:26.969
Stop pressing the button
and then it won't stop...

33:26.970 --> 33:30.239
I have stopped pressing
the button.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.742
And in the joy
of a new beginning.

33:36.747 --> 33:39.848
- Come on, man.
- There's traffic on the highway.

33:39.849 --> 33:42.050
No news on what's causing this
jam, but as soon as we know,

33:42.051 --> 33:44.086
you will, too,
so get comfortable.

33:44.087 --> 33:47.656
You like that, we'll listen
to this for a while?

33:47.657 --> 33:51.193
Don't, I know how to use it,
this is my car.

33:51.194 --> 33:53.265
I'm trying to get back to that...

33:55.265 --> 34:01.574
That concludes our music.

34:03.574 --> 34:10.312
You know, I just wanted
to cut loose, just one night,

34:10.313 --> 34:12.982
just for once in my life,
you know?

34:12.983 --> 34:16.118
One night with no expectations.

34:16.119 --> 34:18.788
This is what I get.

34:18.789 --> 34:22.424
Sorry.

34:22.425 --> 34:26.463
Well, at least I know why
I never did this before.

34:28.465 --> 34:30.065
What?

34:30.067 --> 34:31.734
Come on.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.735
Every girl says that.

34:33.737 --> 34:37.072
Oh, I've never done this before,
this so isn't me.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.308
Honestly, that's the oldest
cliché in the book

34:40.309 --> 34:44.679
and frankly, I expected
more out of you.

34:44.681 --> 34:46.915
Well, maybe the really smart
girls that you're used

34:46.916 --> 34:49.717
to taking home say things
just to get a reaction

34:49.719 --> 34:52.554
or some false sense
of non-slutiness,

34:52.556 --> 34:54.688
but I say what I mean
and I stick to the facts.

34:54.690 --> 34:56.458
It makes for a cleaner argument.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.761
Well, first of all, this is
my Honda, not a courtroom,

34:58.762 --> 35:01.296
second, I'm not arguing,
I'm just disagreeing.

35:01.297 --> 35:04.600
You can't disagree with facts,
that's what makes them facts.

35:04.601 --> 35:06.502
Otherwise, they'd be opinions.

35:06.503 --> 35:09.272
No, they're your facts
and since you're saying them,

35:09.273 --> 35:10.906
that makes them your opinion.

35:10.907 --> 35:11.908
That doesn't make sense.

35:11.909 --> 35:13.142
Yeah, it makes total sense.

35:13.143 --> 35:14.643
- I'll explain it to you.
- Please do.

35:14.644 --> 35:17.346
Okay, good,
since you're confused?

35:17.347 --> 35:19.915
I'm not confused,
your logic isn't logical.

35:19.916 --> 35:21.651
- Illogical.
- Okay, whatever.

35:21.652 --> 35:23.953
You sure you're not
confused here?

35:23.954 --> 35:25.654
I am a little bit, actually,

35:25.655 --> 35:27.556
but only because
you're not making any sense

35:27.557 --> 35:30.426
and not because I can't grasp
your attempt to be esoteric,

35:30.427 --> 35:31.761
but really idiotic point.

35:31.762 --> 35:33.428
Wow, is that what you do
in the courtroom,

35:33.429 --> 35:35.198
just call the defense names?

35:35.199 --> 35:38.634
No, I prove your illogic
via an analogy, okay?

35:38.635 --> 35:40.403
But I thought I'd water it down
for the layman.

35:40.404 --> 35:42.837
Oh, there you go again,
calling the defense names.

35:42.838 --> 35:44.806
I'm a commercial
arbitrator, okay?

35:44.807 --> 35:47.709
There's no defense because
there's no fucking courtroom.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.678
I don't think
I appreciate your tone.

35:49.679 --> 35:51.881
Five minutes of silence!

35:51.882 --> 35:55.917
What, did you just give me
a time out?

35:55.918 --> 35:59.221
I think that we should just have
five minutes to just regroup,

35:59.222 --> 36:00.989
for both of us, okay?

36:00.990 --> 36:03.526
No talking.

36:03.527 --> 36:10.032
Okay, we were sort of in the
middle of that, but whatever.

36:29.885 --> 36:32.187
This is kind of silence.

36:32.188 --> 36:33.824
Sorry.

36:41.231 --> 36:45.034

It's okay.

37:37.521 --> 37:42.957
I think we should just
agree to disagree, okay?

37:42.958 --> 37:46.629
I hear you and I disagree.

37:46.630 --> 37:49.297

No, I disagree with agreeing

37:58.108 --> 38:01.810

38:01.811 --> 38:04.647
Disagreeing is not something
that we should agree on.

38:04.648 --> 38:06.649
That just means that we
can't come to an agreement.

38:06.650 --> 38:08.417
Well, I don't agree,
I think that you and I

you don't do this,

39:19.523 --> 39:21.424
so why's you come home with me?

39:21.425 --> 39:23.259
You Travolta'ed your way
into my pants.

39:23.260 --> 39:25.127
Oh, come on, I've danced
with a lot of girls.

39:25.128 --> 39:26.895
They don't just drop skirt.

39:26.896 --> 39:30.131
I had to put forth half
of the effort that I usually do.

39:30.132 --> 39:31.567
- Usually?
- Yeah.

39:31.568 --> 39:33.569
How many times
constitutes usually?

39:33.570 --> 39:36.071
It's not like I'm some
player or something,

39:36.072 --> 39:41.676
but I tend to have the type
of relationship that lasts,

39:41.677 --> 39:44.513
like, one night.

39:44.514 --> 39:46.348
Where are you going with this
because it kind of sounds

39:46.349 --> 39:47.750
like you're calling me easy?

39:47.751 --> 39:49.618
- No, that's not exactly...
- Pretty much.

39:49.619 --> 39:51.386
Okay, fine, that's exactly
what I'm saying,

39:51.387 --> 39:53.055
but because I don't think
that that's you.

39:53.056 --> 39:55.790
Otherwise, this wouldn't be
so awkward, right?

39:55.791 --> 39:58.194
It would've just been, like,
"Whatever, no big deal."

39:58.195 --> 40:00.995
- You would know.
- Yeah, wait, no.

40:00.996 --> 40:02.564
You don't know me.

40:02.565 --> 40:05.468
No, I don't, but thanks
for reminding me of that.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.736
Look, usually, I'd have
showered you off by now

40:07.737 --> 40:09.038
and gone about my day.

40:09.039 --> 40:10.305
Ew.

40:10.306 --> 40:12.508
So, let's consider this
a moment in time

40:12.509 --> 40:14.743
that should've never
happened, right?

40:14.744 --> 40:17.046
Whether it's the president's
motorcade

40:17.047 --> 40:19.147
or some, like,
fiery car accident

40:19.148 --> 40:21.116
where people are getting
decapitated all over.

40:21.117 --> 40:23.118
That was you, okay?

40:23.119 --> 40:26.087
The point is we shouldn't
probably be here right now

40:26.088 --> 40:28.556
and because we'll most likely
do our separate ways

40:28.557 --> 40:31.993
and never see each other again,
I say we take full advantage

40:31.994 --> 40:33.828
of this opportunity.

40:33.829 --> 40:35.363
Take advantage?

40:35.364 --> 40:37.366
Are you being creepy right now,
don't be creepy?

40:37.367 --> 40:39.634
No, I'm not, I'm saying
that there's no reason

40:39.635 --> 40:42.037
not to be dead honest
with each other

40:42.038 --> 40:45.274
and the only girls that I know
that go to bars alone

40:45.275 --> 40:48.944
are, frankly, alcoholics
or cougars.

40:48.945 --> 40:50.479
Wow, you keep good company.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.381
Which is why it doesn't add up.

40:52.382 --> 40:55.084
So, either you're lying
and you do like me

40:55.085 --> 40:58.988
and care about what I think...

40:58.989 --> 41:00.355
Or?

41:00.356 --> 41:05.528
Or I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

41:05.529 --> 41:07.763
Don't you mean the right place
at the right time?

41:07.764 --> 41:11.200
No, not with someone who says
they don't do this, Sarah.

41:11.201 --> 41:14.706
That's what doesn't add up.

41:16.706 --> 41:18.741
What?

41:18.742 --> 41:20.743
It's Holly.

41:20.744 --> 41:22.947
What's Holly?

41:24.947 --> 41:27.018
My name, if we're being honest.

41:28.018 --> 41:31.757
If we're not, then it's Sarah.

41:33.757 --> 41:36.759
Wow.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.463
What about Kim,
you sure it's not Kim?

41:41.463 --> 41:44.933
That'd be pretty funny
after all this, but no.

41:44.934 --> 41:48.504
That's so unnecessary, like I'm
gonna stalk you or something.

41:48.505 --> 41:51.506
No, I just thought
it would be...

41:51.507 --> 41:54.243
I thought it'd be easier
to be someone else, you know?

41:54.244 --> 41:59.853
- For you maybe.
- Yeah, for me.

42:03.853 --> 42:09.223
Well, I'm still Guy
if it matters.

42:09.224 --> 42:12.493
I know you are.

42:12.494 --> 42:15.497
- Dead honest, right?
- Sure.

42:15.498 --> 42:20.069
Okay, why did you come back
in this morning?

42:20.070 --> 42:25.107
What, so you wouldn't
make me feel like I was cheap?

42:25.108 --> 42:28.746
I left my cell phone.

42:30.746 --> 42:33.115
Well, now I feel cheap.

42:51.501 --> 42:54.636
That, my friend,
is a purple nurple.

42:54.637 --> 42:56.437
That'll get you through
any old kind of day.

42:56.438 --> 43:00.142
Oh, that is awful.

43:00.143 --> 43:02.210
Put hair on your chest there?

43:02.211 --> 43:07.448
Hey, don't look
at my purple nurples.

43:07.449 --> 43:08.951
That's horrible.

43:08.952 --> 43:11.386
You're real funny
with the compliments there.

43:11.387 --> 43:16.191
- I'm sorry.
- I guess I'll take it as such.

43:16.192 --> 43:18.560
What can I say,
I'm a cheap date.

43:18.561 --> 43:21.096
Incoming!

43:21.097 --> 43:22.296
Coming at ya.

43:22.297 --> 43:24.332
Oh, what, wait.

43:24.333 --> 43:27.636
Good job, you can
keep 'em cominin'.

43:27.637 --> 43:29.164
Keep 'em cominin', what's up?

43:30.005 --> 43:32.207
I thought you said one more?

43:32.208 --> 43:33.542
Of each.

43:33.543 --> 43:35.743
Come on, 'bama slamma.

43:35.744 --> 43:37.946
'Bama slamma,
how do you spell that?

43:37.947 --> 43:40.515
Is that all one word there?

43:40.516 --> 43:43.780
You're asking too many questions
and need to be drinking again.

43:44.019 --> 43:46.154
Four, three, two, one.

43:46.155 --> 43:47.923
Why can't you be ugly?

43:52.667 --> 43:53.562
That one's worse.

43:53.563 --> 43:56.464
These steadily get worse.

43:56.465 --> 43:59.767
Come on tough guy, it's time
to spin a lady proper.

43:59.768 --> 44:01.069
Oh, God.

44:01.070 --> 44:04.305
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold your thought, all right?

44:04.306 --> 44:06.140
Just hold the phone here.

44:06.141 --> 44:08.877
What?

44:08.878 --> 44:12.513
I really appreciate
what you're doing, all right?

44:12.514 --> 44:15.817
And I thank you,
but I think that...

44:15.818 --> 44:19.587
- I think we're even.
- Steven?

44:19.588 --> 44:21.323
No, Guy.

44:21.324 --> 44:23.892
Oh, wow, yeah.

44:23.893 --> 44:27.596
See what you did, you went
and got a man drunk here.

44:27.597 --> 44:30.499
Come on, I promise I won't
laugh at your dance moves,

44:30.500 --> 44:32.533
even if they're terrible.

44:32.534 --> 44:37.339
Maybe I should sit back down
here or something?

44:37.340 --> 44:40.542
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.

44:40.543 --> 44:45.714
No, I'm afraid I can't,
but you are beautiful,

44:45.715 --> 44:47.850
all three of you.

44:47.851 --> 44:50.819
Make sure you don't
regret this in the morning.

44:50.820 --> 44:54.656
That is what
I'm in the mood for.

44:54.657 --> 45:00.766
Okay, don't make me
eat the peanuts.

45:02.766 --> 45:07.368
It's a pleasure
to meet you, not Kim.

45:07.369 --> 45:10.339
And you not Steven.

45:10.340 --> 45:12.407
Toodle loo.

45:25.989 --> 45:27.855
You made the right decision.

45:27.856 --> 45:29.625
It was the right choice.

45:29.626 --> 45:31.660
I couldn't help but overhear.

45:31.661 --> 45:34.562
You sort of dropped the ball
on that one, buddy.

45:34.563 --> 45:36.732
Well, maybe you be a little more
comfortable at that joint

45:36.733 --> 45:39.834
around the corner?

45:39.835 --> 45:40.968
No, I'm good.

45:40.969 --> 45:43.138
I'll just take another drink.

45:43.139 --> 45:45.974
All right, well,
I'm just trying to help.

45:51.447 --> 45:56.051
Wait, what joint
around the corner?

45:56.052 --> 46:01.689
Oh, you know,
it's a boys bar for the boys.

46:01.690 --> 46:02.925
You don't say.

right then and there.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.301
These kind of things
can't be rushed.

47:19.302 --> 47:21.435
Don't be so hard on yourself.

47:21.436 --> 47:24.506
Yeah, I just... I want it
to mean something, you know?

47:24.507 --> 47:26.040
I mean, I didn't care
if I was the last to kiss

47:26.041 --> 47:30.712
out of all my friends,
but it had to be Eliza Bross,

47:30.713 --> 47:34.549
'cause I was in love
with Eliza Bross.

47:34.550 --> 47:36.752
- How old were you?
- Sixth grade.

47:36.753 --> 47:39.388
Sixth grade, you weren't afraid
of catching cooties,

47:39.389 --> 47:41.390
'cause I had that,
you don't want that stuff?

47:41.391 --> 47:44.625
- Wait, cooties are curable?
- No.

47:44.626 --> 47:46.194
No, you're just stuck with them?

47:46.195 --> 47:48.230
Yeah, they're just there.

47:48.231 --> 47:49.631
Well, good to know.

47:49.632 --> 47:51.799
When I was in third grade,
I rode my Schwinn

47:51.800 --> 47:55.703
like 15 blocks to her house,
rang the doorbell, she answered,

47:55.704 --> 47:57.305
but I asked to speak
to her father.

47:57.306 --> 47:59.341
Said, "Sir, may I have
permission to take Eliza

47:59.342 --> 48:01.109
to the sixth grade dance."

48:01.110 --> 48:02.743
- In third grade?
- Yeah, man.

48:02.744 --> 48:07.582
I wanted to lock that down,
didn't want to take any chances.

48:07.583 --> 48:10.218
I gave Craig Grayson
my red crown

48:10.219 --> 48:12.888
as a token of my love
in kindergarten.

48:12.889 --> 48:15.290
Well, that is pretty adorable.

48:15.291 --> 48:18.560
He ate it,
he just chewed it right up.

48:18.561 --> 48:22.199
Guys can be such jerks,
never ends the way you think.

48:24.199 --> 48:27.035
My first kiss was Jodie Fladal

48:27.036 --> 48:28.537
in the back of the library.

48:28.538 --> 48:31.806
It didn't mean anything,
it was just a kiss.

48:31.807 --> 48:33.375
Life is cruel.

48:33.376 --> 48:36.111
Seventh grade, there was
a spin the bottle party

48:36.112 --> 48:37.578
and I was praying
the whole night

48:37.579 --> 48:39.714
that it would land on Craig,
but every time

48:39.715 --> 48:41.450
that stupid two liter
went around,

48:41.451 --> 48:44.319
it was Arie Kowalski,
Arie Kowalski,

48:44.320 --> 48:46.421
Arie Kowalski again!

48:46.422 --> 48:48.357
Seriously, it was like
that thing was magnetized

48:48.358 --> 48:51.792
or something, we must've kissed
11 times that night.

48:51.793 --> 48:52.893
- What?
- Yeah.

48:52.894 --> 48:54.763
You never got around
to kissing Craig?

48:54.764 --> 48:56.698
Well, by that point, me and Arie

48:56.699 --> 49:00.602
were pretty much boyfriend
and girlfriend, so...

49:00.603 --> 49:02.770
So...

49:02.771 --> 49:04.238
I don't know, I guess
I'm just not the type

49:04.239 --> 49:06.207
to go around kissing whomever.

49:06.208 --> 49:08.276
No, clearly.

49:08.277 --> 49:09.778
Hey, me and Arie dated

49:09.779 --> 49:12.147
actually until, like,
the tenth grade, so...

49:12.148 --> 49:15.917
Wow, by then,
Eliza was a lesbian.

49:15.918 --> 49:18.620
- What about sixth grade dance?
- Oh, we went.

49:18.621 --> 49:21.089
No kiss, how could she resist?

49:21.090 --> 49:23.859
Well, I didn't really possess
those skills back then,

49:23.860 --> 49:26.895
but that didn't stop my sister
from draggin' me to dance class

49:26.896 --> 49:28.663
two times a week.

49:28.664 --> 49:30.364
There was no boys in the class,

49:30.365 --> 49:32.801
so she used to dress me up
in this, like, rhinestone outfit

49:33.001 --> 49:36.605
and made me practice with
all her friends after school.

49:36.606 --> 49:39.508
Eventually, I picked up a couple
dance moves along the way.

49:39.509 --> 49:41.142
Well, you see, I grew up
with five siblings,

49:41.143 --> 49:43.412
so I learned to dance waiting
in line for the bathroom.

49:43.413 --> 49:45.446
I noticed the pee-pee shuffle.

49:45.447 --> 49:46.816
Yeah, how'd that go again?

49:47.016 --> 49:50.722
- Kind of like this, right?
- There it is, in the hips.

49:52.722 --> 49:54.555
Yeah, and what about
your sister?

49:54.556 --> 49:56.857
Is she still dressing you up
in all that glitter and...

49:56.858 --> 50:02.464
No, fortunately, she got married
and opened up a baby factory.

50:02.465 --> 50:04.533
Tell me about it, mine, too.

50:04.534 --> 50:08.303
I'm just gonna have a boy first,
just one,

50:08.304 --> 50:09.638
and then three years later,
a girl,

50:09.639 --> 50:11.205
and then I'm closing up shop.

50:11.206 --> 50:12.473
Yeah, just shutting
that shit down?

50:12.474 --> 50:17.111
Just sealing it up forever.

50:17.112 --> 50:21.183
♪ Where I am going ♪

50:21.184 --> 50:28.556
♪ 'Cause I do things

50:28.557 --> 50:31.228
Not many bars around here?

50:33.228 --> 50:35.129
What's wrong with the one
you're in?

50:35.130 --> 50:37.966
I meant your phone reception.

50:37.967 --> 50:39.468
Yeah.

50:39.469 --> 50:42.404
I have full bars
if you want to call her.

50:42.405 --> 50:45.108
No thanks, I'm good.

50:52.114 --> 50:54.049
Need a drink?

50:54.050 --> 50:56.951
You know what,
I'm actually gonna take off.

50:56.952 --> 50:59.453
Come on, just one.

50:59.454 --> 51:01.922
- Just one?
- Yeah, just one.

51:01.923 --> 51:04.392
Thank you, but I'm not
accepting charity

51:04.393 --> 51:06.560
from pretty ladies anymore.

51:06.561 --> 51:09.430
Oh, that's a strange rule
for a guy.

51:09.431 --> 51:11.232
Strange rule for anyone really.

51:11.233 --> 51:13.033
You're a strange guy?

51:13.034 --> 51:15.403
Okay, kick a man when he's down.

51:15.404 --> 51:17.089
Aw, now I gotta buy you a drink.

51:17.607 --> 51:19.306
Unless you wanna keep up
the illusion

51:19.307 --> 51:21.076
that you're just sitting
here alone.

51:21.077 --> 51:23.879
I mean, she might still show.

51:23.880 --> 51:27.716
Wow, do they teach you
this secret mind game

51:27.717 --> 51:29.984
in some sort of school?

51:29.985 --> 51:32.053
It's pretty much innate.

51:32.054 --> 51:33.721
Let me ask you something.

51:33.722 --> 51:36.892
Why, why do girls do it?

51:36.893 --> 51:39.895
Why give a guy your phone number
if you're not interested?

51:39.896 --> 51:43.564
Why text him witty banter
throughout the day?

51:43.565 --> 51:48.203
And why set up a date if you
don't intend on keeping it?

51:48.204 --> 51:50.574
He'll have what I'm having.

51:52.293 --> 51:54.609
Yeah, I do get
the phone number thing though.

51:54.610 --> 51:56.544
- Do you?
- Yeah, of course.

51:56.545 --> 51:59.647
Because we put all this effort
into it and we get our hopes up

51:59.648 --> 52:02.049
and then we wait
the three days before calling,

52:02.050 --> 52:05.453
but then we call and it goes
straight to voice mail.

52:05.454 --> 52:07.856
It crushes our hearts.

52:11.994 --> 52:13.395
Right on cue.

52:13.396 --> 52:16.997
Oh no, it's not what
you think, trust me.

52:16.998 --> 52:19.701
It's just easier sometimes
with caller ID

52:19.702 --> 52:21.669
to just... not.

52:21.670 --> 52:23.971
Why not just give him
a fake phone number then?

52:23.972 --> 52:26.040
That way he calls,
he doesn't get you,

52:26.041 --> 52:28.310
end of social transaction.

52:28.311 --> 52:30.245
But what if he calls
right in from of you

52:30.246 --> 52:32.647
and then you're busted,
so awkward?

52:32.648 --> 52:34.348
God forbid that the guy
you don't like

52:34.349 --> 52:36.183
and don't wanna spend
any time with knows

52:36.184 --> 52:38.553
you don't like him and don't
wanna spend any time with him.

52:38.554 --> 52:40.355
Okay, but what would you prefer,

52:40.356 --> 52:42.323
that she says
she has a boyfriend?

52:42.324 --> 52:47.128
I don't know, how 'bout that
you're just not feelin' it?

52:48.297 --> 52:50.332
I'm just not feelin' it.

52:50.333 --> 52:52.701
You see, there you go?

52:52.702 --> 52:55.736
And then I get up and walk away
and that's the end.

52:55.737 --> 52:58.305
I don't like that,
where's the fun in that?

52:58.306 --> 53:00.475
No, no, no, see,
none of this is fun

53:00.476 --> 53:02.743
on the guy's side,
it's all work.

53:02.744 --> 53:07.816
The fun comes, for lack
of a better term, when we do.

53:07.817 --> 53:09.584
What a douche.

53:09.585 --> 53:12.886
Exactly.

53:12.887 --> 53:14.989
You're just enjoying
this whole thing.

53:14.990 --> 53:16.625
- No.
- Yeah.

53:16.626 --> 53:18.459
- Okay, maybe a little.
- Yeah, a little bit.

53:18.460 --> 53:21.663
But it's a laughing with,
enjoying with kind of thing.

53:21.664 --> 53:24.232
Oh, good, good,
that gives me confidence.

53:24.233 --> 53:25.600
Yeah.

53:25.601 --> 53:27.868
What the hell is this,
it's yellow?

53:27.869 --> 53:31.406
This is on behalf
of my entire gender,

53:31.407 --> 53:33.908
since you were stood up,
an apology.

53:33.909 --> 53:38.414
Okay, in that case,
keep 'em comin'.

53:41.684 --> 53:46.521
Oh, no, not if you plan
on kissing me, deathly allergic.

53:50.893 --> 53:52.300
All right.

53:57.900 --> 53:59.667
- What is that?
- It's a protein bar.

53:59.668 --> 54:02.837
- We'll split it.
- Is that peanut butter?

54:02.838 --> 54:05.573
What, oh shit, I forgot.

54:05.574 --> 54:07.341
Unless you want me to go
into anaphylactic shock

54:07.342 --> 54:09.044
with no chance
of getting me to a hospital,

54:09.045 --> 54:10.312
kindly put it away.

54:10.313 --> 54:11.846
All right, okay.

54:11.847 --> 54:12.781
Over there, please.

54:12.782 --> 54:16.283
Okay.

54:16.284 --> 54:20.221
FYI, girls like a guy
who listens.

54:20.222 --> 54:23.857
- To everything?
- Deathly allergic.

54:23.858 --> 54:24.959
I wasn't kidding.

54:24.960 --> 54:27.662
All right, I'm sorry.

54:27.663 --> 54:30.000
I had a buddy
who was allergic to latex.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.567
- Yeah, right.
- He is, what?

54:33.568 --> 54:35.303
If condoms were made
of bubblegum,

54:35.304 --> 54:37.971
then all guys would be allergic
to Bubblicious.

54:37.972 --> 54:39.473
Okay, fair enough.

54:39.474 --> 54:41.942
But I am actually allergic
to shellfish though.

54:41.943 --> 54:43.310
- Me, too.
- Oh, see?

54:43.311 --> 54:44.745
We have another thing in common.

54:44.746 --> 54:46.881
Along with coconuts,
cashews, Brazil nuts,

54:46.882 --> 54:48.683
chocolates and bee stings.

54:48.684 --> 54:51.486
Okay, not so much.

54:51.487 --> 54:52.721
Does your throat close up?

54:52.722 --> 54:55.156
Do you get those
hives everywhere?

54:55.157 --> 54:59.627
- No, no, I just get drunk.
- What?

54:59.628 --> 55:01.696
I know that it
sounds ridiculous,

55:01.697 --> 55:04.499
but shellfish makes me
feel wasted.

55:04.500 --> 55:09.770
I slur my speech, I lose
my balance, I get all happy.

55:09.771 --> 55:12.774
That's bullshit
and completely unfair.

55:12.775 --> 55:15.310
Hey, it's no picnic,
I get that pit in my stomach

55:15.311 --> 55:20.247
every time I pass a Red Lobster,
I swear to God.

55:20.248 --> 55:24.886
Well, if a bee comes near me,
it's no party, it's a funeral.

55:24.887 --> 55:28.156
Oh, death by bee sting,
what a lousy way to go.

55:28.157 --> 55:29.591
It almost happened once.

55:29.592 --> 55:31.459
I was at a family picnic
and I was walking

55:31.460 --> 55:34.395
and I stepped on a bee,
boom, anaphylactic shock.

55:34.396 --> 55:35.796
The next thing I know,
I was on a gurney,

55:35.797 --> 55:38.399
being rushed to the ER in front
of, like, a hundred

55:38.400 --> 55:40.734
of my relatives,
all panicked and neurotic,

55:40.735 --> 55:44.939
hence the overcautious
handling of your...

55:44.940 --> 55:48.347
Were you about to say my nuts?

55:51.347 --> 55:53.281
You little, dirty girl.

55:53.282 --> 55:55.482
Unbelievable.

55:55.483 --> 55:57.551
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

55:57.552 --> 55:59.854
So, when we were like, you know,
fooling around or whatever

55:59.855 --> 56:02.189
last night, I could've
killed you

56:02.190 --> 56:04.959
if I had a coconut daiquiri
or something?

56:04.960 --> 56:06.593
Well, I wouldn't have
gone home with you

56:06.594 --> 56:08.229
if you'd had a coconut daiquiri,

56:08.230 --> 56:11.899
but I might've swelled up
and fainted.

56:11.900 --> 56:15.070
My kiss does have that effect
on women.

56:27.115 --> 56:28.985
Kim.

56:29.985 --> 56:32.319
Yeah?

56:32.320 --> 56:36.056
Wow, it's nice
to actually meet you.

56:36.057 --> 56:37.057
You, too.

56:38.027 --> 56:39.727
Rob said to look for the girl

56:39.728 --> 56:43.064
who walks into the bar
like she owns the place, so.

56:43.065 --> 56:46.067
Oh, okay.

56:46.068 --> 56:48.303
You're on a blind date?

56:48.304 --> 56:49.304
Yeah, aren't you?

56:51.172 --> 56:53.575
Oh, okay, I'm confused

56:53.576 --> 56:55.109
you just said that you were Kim.

56:55.110 --> 57:00.848
Oh, I know, I just kinda
wanted to go with it, sorry.

57:00.849 --> 57:04.852
Wha... hold on, what if you are
Kim, but you're not telling me

57:04.853 --> 57:07.921
'cause, you know,
you don't think I'm cute.

57:07.922 --> 57:09.156
Aw.

57:09.157 --> 57:10.825
No, I think you're cute.

Um, can I get a Jack and coke?

58:28.637 --> 58:29.637
Oh.

58:31.172 --> 58:33.808
Yup.

58:33.809 --> 58:35.646
Yup, yup what?

58:37.646 --> 58:38.712
Nothin'.

58:38.713 --> 58:40.714
No, yup something,
or no yup at all,

58:40.715 --> 58:42.616
so what's up with the yup?

58:42.617 --> 58:45.720
Yup, you're the type of girl
that always has a boyfriend.

58:45.721 --> 58:49.089
Oh, yup, pretty much
since high school.

58:49.090 --> 58:51.892
I could tell, you got that vibe.

58:51.893 --> 58:53.794
I don't have vibe.

58:53.795 --> 58:54.895
You don't?

58:54.896 --> 58:58.232
Okay, what were you
doing three years ago

58:58.233 --> 59:00.734
for New Year's Eve?

59:00.735 --> 59:01.401
Random.

59:01.402 --> 59:03.937
What were you doing?

59:03.938 --> 59:04.906
I was with Rick in Aruba.

59:04.907 --> 59:06.040
Right.

59:06.041 --> 59:08.176
You were with Rick in Aruba.

59:08.177 --> 59:11.812
You weren't in Aruba with Rick,
you were with Rick in Aruba.

59:11.813 --> 59:12.913
Yeah, so?

59:12.914 --> 59:14.415
So you figure out
what you were doing

59:14.416 --> 59:16.384
based on who you were with,
you know?

59:16.385 --> 59:18.886
Like it's a measurement of time.

59:18.887 --> 59:20.821
That's a serial
monogamist talking.

59:20.822 --> 59:23.086
All right, what's your
longest relationship?

59:24.025 --> 59:24.526
This.

59:24.726 --> 59:25.926
Exactly.

59:25.927 --> 59:27.794
Okay, what's your
shortest relationship?

59:27.795 --> 59:29.129
- This.
- Right.

59:29.130 --> 59:31.031
So you're a serial monogamist.

59:31.032 --> 59:32.332
And you're a serial datist.

59:32.333 --> 59:34.301
Okay, well,
what do we have in common?

59:34.302 --> 59:36.940
The beginning
of a really bad joke?

59:38.940 --> 59:42.343
Look, I admit, I've had my fair
share of meaningless sex,

59:42.344 --> 59:44.879
but I haven't done this
in quite a while.

59:44.880 --> 59:46.381
Oh, that's comforting.

59:46.382 --> 59:51.021
Yeah, I sort of made a vow
not to do this anymore.

59:52.021 --> 59:53.257
Like ever.

59:55.257 --> 59:57.991
You took... Oh, my God,
you're married?

59:57.992 --> 59:59.259
No, I'm...

59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.162
Yes, you are!

01:00:00.362 --> 01:00:02.330
No, trust me, I'm not married!

01:00:02.331 --> 01:00:03.830
Then what are you talking about?

01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:05.899
Look, I can't meet a real girl

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.037
if I'm bangin' a bunch
of worthless chicks.

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:09.805
- Not cool!
- Okay,

01:00:10.005 --> 01:00:11.305
worthless to me!

01:00:11.306 --> 01:00:12.540
I don't mean you're worthless.

01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:13.774
Oh, I... I'm sorry, stop!

01:00:13.775 --> 01:00:16.109
Please, stop hitting me
for just a second

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.353
and let me explain, all right?

01:00:24.353 --> 01:00:25.819
It's been seven months

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:29.723
since I woke up next
to this random Asian girl

01:00:29.724 --> 01:00:31.359
whose name I still
don't remember,

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.993
and I promised myself right then

01:00:32.994 --> 01:00:39.033
that I wasn't gonna have anymore
unemotional sex ever again.

01:00:39.034 --> 01:00:40.600
Well, you need to work on that.

01:00:40.601 --> 01:00:43.875
Yeah, well, I was doin' fine
up until I met you.

01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:49.679
So, then why break
this mighty vow over me?

01:00:51.679 --> 01:00:54.816
Call it a moment of weakness.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.984
Wow, you really know
how to make a girl feel special.

01:00:57.985 --> 01:00:59.120
I wasn't trying to...

01:00:59.121 --> 01:01:00.648
Oh, smooth, yeah, keep going.

01:01:01.023 --> 01:01:03.156
No, that's... that's
not what I meant.

01:01:03.157 --> 01:01:04.058
- I meant that...
- So what,

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:05.225
this is all my fault?

01:01:05.226 --> 01:01:06.960
You could've said "No",
you know.

01:01:06.961 --> 01:01:08.796
I believe that I tried.

01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:10.131
Who the hell knows

01:01:10.132 --> 01:01:11.933
with all the poison you
were feeding me last night.

01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:14.634
So what, I... I got you drunk
and took advantage?

01:01:14.635 --> 01:01:16.907
Both of those things did happen.

01:01:18.907 --> 01:01:19.907
Shit.

01:01:21.076 --> 01:01:22.877
You didn't stand a chance.

01:01:22.878 --> 01:01:24.946
I'm the reason that
girls think guys are jerks.

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:28.249
I'm... I'm that girl,
I hate that girl.

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:30.283
I give girls like me a bad name!

01:01:30.284 --> 01:01:32.053
I just gave myself a bad name!

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:35.823
You know how hard it is to not
have sex for seven months?

01:01:35.824 --> 01:01:38.859
Please, I was in
a relationship for six years

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.460
that should have been
over after four.

01:01:40.461 --> 01:01:42.796
I get not having sex
for a while.

01:01:42.797 --> 01:01:43.964
Jesus.

01:01:43.965 --> 01:01:45.399
Yeah.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.801
You're like the poster child
for monogamy.

01:01:47.001 --> 01:01:49.770
Well, which is why I don't
have genital herpes, so.

01:01:49.771 --> 01:01:52.739
- Oh, that's good to know.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:56.611
All right, so since we're here,
you know,

01:01:56.612 --> 01:02:00.180
and we did what
we did last night,

01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:03.049
there's something
I wanna ask you.

01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:04.820
Do I...

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.360
...do I-...

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.728
Never mind.

01:02:13.728 --> 01:02:15.562
You did not just do that.

01:02:15.563 --> 01:02:16.997
Okay, I'm sorry that I did that,
I hate it when people do that,

01:02:16.998 --> 01:02:19.399
but... I just don't
wanna talk about it.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.067
Come on, just say it.

01:02:21.068 --> 01:02:24.016
No, I don't, just forget it,
forget I ever said anything.

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:30.111
What the hell was that?

01:02:30.112 --> 01:02:31.245
What are you talking about?

01:02:31.246 --> 01:02:33.381
What... that is very bizarre.

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:35.348
You freaked the guy out
right next to us.

01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:37.752
- What guy?
- He's a sensitive soul.

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:39.120
Yeah, right.

01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:41.964
Are you gonna ask me what
you were gonna ask me or not?

01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:47.929
Do I look like
a epileptic when I cum?

01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:52.633
What?

01:02:52.634 --> 01:02:54.267
Totally, is that what
you were gonna ask me?

01:02:54.268 --> 01:02:56.303
Wait, I do, seriously?

01:02:56.304 --> 01:02:57.971
- Yeah.
- Shit, really?

01:02:57.972 --> 01:03:01.342
Yeah, you go,"
yeah, you like that?"

01:03:02.878 --> 01:03:05.046
What, that's not what,
no, come on.

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.781
I literally thought
that you'd stuck your foot

01:03:07.782 --> 01:03:10.718
in like an electrical socket
or something.

01:03:10.719 --> 01:03:12.920
That's just... that's stupid.

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:19.293
Okay, okay, I get it,
you can stop laughing at me.

01:03:21.822 --> 01:03:23.296
With the eye and everything?

01:03:23.297 --> 01:03:24.833
What, I look like Popeye.

01:03:26.768 --> 01:03:29.569
That's ridiculous, I don't
even wanna look at myself.

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:30.671
Geez.

01:03:30.672 --> 01:03:32.239
Did somebody actually
say this to you?

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.241
Yes, yes, but she wasn't
wearing her glasses

01:03:34.242 --> 01:03:35.542
when we were doin' it,

01:03:35.543 --> 01:03:37.701
so I didn't know if she
was to be trusted.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.281
It's just weird, I just... I've
practiced this in the mirror

01:03:41.282 --> 01:03:42.783
like a million times,

01:03:42.784 --> 01:03:45.085
but every time I start
to get there my eyes close,

01:03:45.086 --> 01:03:46.402
and I can't see anything.

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:49.689
No, I'm serious.

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:53.593
I literally, I physically
cannot, I know,

01:03:53.594 --> 01:03:56.730
I can't keep my eyes open,
there's no... it's like a sneeze.

01:03:56.731 --> 01:03:59.267
Like they just shut, you know?

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:00.667
And then after that
I'm just like,

01:04:00.668 --> 01:04:04.072
"Who gives a shit
what I look like."

01:04:05.974 --> 01:04:08.878
Oh, God, oh.

01:04:09.709 --> 01:04:12.078
There's something you should
know, by the way,

01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:13.113
something else.

01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:14.848
- What, oh God.
- No... no.

01:04:14.849 --> 01:04:17.651
Last... it's just that last night
when I was down there,

01:04:17.652 --> 01:04:21.891
you know, I didn't actually,
I didn't actually swallow.

01:04:22.891 --> 01:04:24.225
Wait, you didn't?

01:04:24.226 --> 01:04:27.231
No, I just... I spit it out
on the floor.

01:04:29.231 --> 01:04:31.966
Hold on, how the hell
did I not know what?

01:04:31.967 --> 01:04:33.634
What are you a magician?

01:04:33.635 --> 01:04:35.268
I'm just wondering,
because, you know,

01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:37.837
it's not like I was in
a meeting, I was right there.

01:04:37.838 --> 01:04:40.154
I know, well, you were
in the throes of your.

01:04:40.742 --> 01:04:42.709
Okay, all right,
we've covered that.

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:44.678
I don't know,
that's a little weird.

01:04:44.679 --> 01:04:47.574
And expecting me to swallow
a stranger's man milk isn't?

01:04:48.016 --> 01:04:51.084
I don't know, it's
a recreational hazard, right?

01:04:51.085 --> 01:04:54.254
Unless it's on your allergen
list, what's the big deal?

01:04:54.255 --> 01:04:55.656
It's just really personal,
you know,

01:04:55.657 --> 01:04:57.457
if we were dating
it would be different.

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.893
Okay, how does the definition of
a relationship change anything?

01:04:59.894 --> 01:05:01.861
You're either doin'
what you're doin'

01:05:01.862 --> 01:05:03.730
with the guy you're doin'
it with, or you're not.

01:05:03.731 --> 01:05:05.899
Well, sue me for wanting to know
a guy a little better

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.268
before I have a pool party
in my stomach

01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:10.671
with 100 million
of his closes friends.

01:05:10.672 --> 01:05:13.107
Wow, that is a case
that I just might pursue,

01:05:13.108 --> 01:05:14.908
right there, council.

01:05:14.909 --> 01:05:18.779
I mean, you know, you spit out
my essence like a Gobstopper.

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.980
- Come on.
- You kill a country

01:05:20.014 --> 01:05:21.082
full of my DNA.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.049
That's... that's genocide!

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:24.118
You're a monster!

01:05:24.119 --> 01:05:25.319
Oh, my God!

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.054
You're a Republican.

01:05:27.971 --> 01:05:29.656
My parents are both Republicans,

01:05:29.657 --> 01:05:31.258
but just 'cause
they wanna save money.

01:05:31.259 --> 01:05:33.259
They're pro-choice,
and for gay rights,

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.761
it doesn't make an sense.

01:05:34.762 --> 01:05:36.930
Yeah, well, my sister's
a ham-eating Jew,

01:05:36.931 --> 01:05:39.899
what are you gonna do?

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.801
I find it interesting
that people just

01:05:41.802 --> 01:05:44.171
hear the parts that
they wanna hear.

01:05:44.172 --> 01:05:45.939
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.207
Pork is nasty.

01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:51.511
Well, we can finally
agree on something.

01:05:51.512 --> 01:05:52.747
I used to eat
all kinds of animal

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:54.848
before I watched
this documentary.

01:05:54.849 --> 01:05:56.850
Oh, no, come on, come on,
please, don't with that

01:05:56.851 --> 01:05:58.618
'cause I... I really
love me some steak,

01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:00.187
and I don't wanna ruin it.

01:06:00.188 --> 01:06:01.888
You think that that's better?

01:06:01.889 --> 01:06:04.825
They hang the animal upside
down, and they slit its throat

01:06:04.826 --> 01:06:06.694
and they just let it
bleed out on the floor!

01:06:06.695 --> 01:06:08.294
La-la-la,
don't ruin this for me!

01:06:08.295 --> 01:06:09.863
Just a minute ago,
you were talkin' about

01:06:09.864 --> 01:06:12.933
how you swallowed my, you know,
my... however you put it,

01:06:12.934 --> 01:06:13.968
can we just get back to that!

01:06:13.969 --> 01:06:15.669
No, 'cause I didn't!

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:17.805
Yeah, I know you didn't,
but you acted like you did,

01:06:18.005 --> 01:06:20.808
which I thought was
really sweet, really.

01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:25.046
La-la-la-la-la-la!

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:26.279
Okay, you're safe.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.049
- Promise?
- Yeah.

01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:34.087
It's just that there's all this
fecal matter in the hamburger.

01:06:34.088 --> 01:06:36.189
Oh, you went
to the fecal matter.

01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:37.625
- I'm sorry.
- That's ridiculous.

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:38.927
Done, sustained!

01:06:39.927 --> 01:06:41.361
People like you.

01:06:41.362 --> 01:06:44.198
All you wanna do is lock people
up in your tofu jail,

01:06:44.199 --> 01:06:46.033
you blood-sucking lawyer.

01:06:46.034 --> 01:06:48.134
You're the one that wanted
to be dead honest.

01:06:48.135 --> 01:06:49.870
Yeah, but not about that.

01:06:49.871 --> 01:06:51.171
In fact, not about anything

01:06:51.172 --> 01:06:53.973
that would change
my view on anything.

01:06:53.974 --> 01:06:55.341
Way to grow.

01:06:55.342 --> 01:06:58.111
You slap me, you call me names.

01:06:58.112 --> 01:07:00.980
I didn't call you any names,
what names did I call you?

01:07:00.981 --> 01:07:03.951
Layman?

01:07:03.952 --> 01:07:05.953
Oh, well, I'm sure
you've been called worse.

01:07:05.954 --> 01:07:07.054
And Steven.

01:07:08.989 --> 01:07:10.658
That's pretty bad.

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.792
And now I don't know if I can
eat a hamburger anymore.

01:07:12.793 --> 01:07:15.062
Oh boo-hoo,
I ruined Hanukah.

01:07:15.063 --> 01:07:16.296
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
hold on.

01:07:16.297 --> 01:07:17.997
Do you know the license
plate to this car?

01:07:17.998 --> 01:07:19.533
No, how would I?

01:07:19.534 --> 01:07:23.104
Yeah, it's APR-15,
do you know what that means?

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:24.270
April 15th?

01:07:24.271 --> 01:07:27.073
April 15th, and you know why?

01:07:27.074 --> 01:07:28.741
Because it's my car,

01:07:28.742 --> 01:07:32.413
it's registered to me under
my name, my address, my car,

01:07:32.414 --> 01:07:33.781
that means my rules.

01:07:33.782 --> 01:07:35.850
When you're in your car
it's your rules,

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:38.986
but now you're in my car,
April 15th, my rules.

01:07:38.987 --> 01:07:40.187
Okay, Dad.

01:07:40.188 --> 01:07:41.921
Okay, so you go over
to your window

01:07:41.922 --> 01:07:44.792
and think about what you've
done, I'm callin' five minutes.

01:07:44.793 --> 01:07:46.160
You can't call five minutes,
that's my thing!

01:07:46.161 --> 01:07:47.931

for those of you

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:53.212
stuck in that dead-stop
traffic jam, it turns out,

01:10:53.213 --> 01:10:54.415
and get a load of this,

- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:14:54.655 --> 01:14:56.156
Okay, I've been
bragging about you

01:14:56.157 --> 01:14:58.058
to your Uncle Ken
and his wife Stella.

01:14:58.059 --> 01:14:59.992
Okay.

01:14:59.993 --> 01:15:01.528
Holly!

01:15:01.529 --> 01:15:02.929
Hello.

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:06.800
- Look how beautiful you are!
- Thank you.

01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:10.804
So which one of these gorgeous
little kids are yours?

01:15:10.805 --> 01:15:11.805
I'm not married.

01:15:12.006 --> 01:15:14.428
Oh, well, I don't think
you have to be anymore.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.880
Oh, there she is with dad,

01:15:20.881 --> 01:15:23.082
talking to cousins
number 28 and 29.

01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:27.386
No, that's definitely some kind
of aunt and uncle of some sort.

01:15:27.387 --> 01:15:28.854
Oh, God, she's giving me
the "save me" eyes.

01:15:28.855 --> 01:15:30.256
Quick, call her over.

01:15:30.257 --> 01:15:33.093
Your face was blown up like
a big tomato, the bee sting,

01:15:33.094 --> 01:15:34.200
do you remember that?

01:15:35.963 --> 01:15:38.000
Oh, my God, we've had
so much fun.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.867
Hols!

01:15:41.868 --> 01:15:50.309
Oh, sorry, so nice to meet
you Uncle Ken, Aunt Stella.

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:52.278
What is she doing with her hair?

01:15:52.279 --> 01:15:54.246
Okay, stop it.

01:15:54.247 --> 01:15:55.148
Thanks, guys.

01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:56.916
Hey, sis, nice shoes.

01:15:56.917 --> 01:15:59.152
Oh, thanks, you've
seen these before.

01:15:59.153 --> 01:16:00.153
I know.

01:16:02.055 --> 01:16:03.055
Where's, Rick?

01:16:03.056 --> 01:16:04.090
Oh, yeah.

01:16:04.091 --> 01:16:06.962
Oh, he's, he's good.

01:16:07.962 --> 01:16:11.131
Um, where is he?

01:16:13.134 --> 01:16:14.800
- Oh, no.
- What happened?

01:16:14.801 --> 01:16:16.370
Noth... what are you
talking about?

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:18.772
Oh, shut up, again?

01:16:18.773 --> 01:16:21.942
You know, it's for the best,
it wasn't right.

01:16:21.943 --> 01:16:23.242
He wasn't ready, you know.

01:16:23.243 --> 01:16:25.144
But why... why are
they all never ready?

01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:29.916
I don't know, but I'm not gonna
waste my time, so.

01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:31.917
Well, we're way past that
point by now, aren't we?

01:16:31.918 --> 01:16:33.786
Oh yeah, I mean,
after three years,

01:16:33.787 --> 01:16:35.788
he's still not sure at this age?

01:16:35.789 --> 01:16:37.323
There must be
something else going on.

01:16:37.324 --> 01:16:40.093
I mean, this is crazy,
he was a good one.

01:16:40.094 --> 01:16:42.962
- Yeah.
- Not to mention, gorgeous!

01:16:42.963 --> 01:16:46.399
I mean, I completely
picture you two together.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.867
You're a cute couple!

01:16:47.868 --> 01:16:49.635
What exactly did you do?

01:16:49.636 --> 01:16:50.871
I didn't do anything.

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.371
Well, maybe that's the issue.

01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:53.739
Oh, yeah, remember when
you broke up with Max,

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:55.375
and he said he felt like
he wasn't number one.

01:16:55.376 --> 01:16:57.144
Wasn't it
the same with David, too?

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:58.679
There's something with you?

01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.946
- Excuse me?
- Be nice.

01:16:59.947 --> 01:17:01.313
I am nice.

01:17:01.314 --> 01:17:03.416
Did you ever think
that maybe it's not me,

01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:05.352
maybe it's them?

01:17:05.353 --> 01:17:07.254
You're the only
common denominator

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:08.988
in your relationships, Holly.

01:17:08.989 --> 01:17:11.621
Well, there still must be
some way we can fix this.

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.894
There's nothing to fix.

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:17.296
I just think the fixing maybe
needs to happen right here.

01:17:17.297 --> 01:17:18.898
Still, not nice.

01:17:18.899 --> 01:17:20.901
- Vicious.
- Well, she's drunk.

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:23.639
I mean, it's the truth,
she just needs to swallow it.

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.108
- Okay, I'm done.
- No, sweetie!

01:17:28.109 --> 01:17:30.943
Just don't do anything
before you think about it.

01:17:30.944 --> 01:17:31.944
Those shoes.

01:17:33.747 --> 01:17:36.051
It's, this red one up here.

01:17:39.252 --> 01:17:40.252
This is me.

01:17:48.162 --> 01:17:49.162
- So.
- So.

01:17:57.904 --> 01:18:01.241
I think I found a way
for you to keep your record.

01:18:01.242 --> 01:18:03.109
- My record?
- Yeah.

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:07.581
Oh, of, never having done
this one-night thing before.

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:09.349
- Oh, my record.
- Yeah.

01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:12.818
Well, I'm not sure that's what
this still is, technically.

01:18:12.819 --> 01:18:14.420
Well, I think technically it is,
you know,

01:18:14.421 --> 01:18:16.322
until we do it again.

01:18:16.323 --> 01:18:19.760
So, that's all
we have to do, right?

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:21.894
You know, see each other again
is what I'm proposing,

01:18:21.895 --> 01:18:23.130
not just like.

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:25.197
Oh yeah, for
the sake of my record.

01:18:25.198 --> 01:18:28.068
Strictly for that, yes.

01:18:28.069 --> 01:18:30.774
Yeah, okay, okay.

01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:36.143
Nice to meet you, Guy, really.

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:37.979
Actually.

01:18:38.979 --> 01:18:41.314
You, too, Holly.

01:18:46.287 --> 01:18:47.958
