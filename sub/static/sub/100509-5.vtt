01:05.482 --> 01:07.233
No, no, no.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.820
What a piece of junk.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.239
Now, how am I gonna fix this?

02:39.200 --> 02:42.704
Oh! Bad crash. Nice roll, though.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.206
Thanks... I guess.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.376
That bike is trash.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.921
I don't know what I was thinking
when I bought it.

02:52.797 --> 02:57.761
Look at this mess.
The repulsor blew. The compressor is shot.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.388
Sounds like you know
a thing or two about engines.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.683
I'm sorry. Who are you?

03:04.142 --> 03:05.143
I'm Trace.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.482
Ahsoka.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.984
As for your bike, you're in luck.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.863
You happened to crash onto
one of the best repair shops on 1313.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.199
So you're a mechanic?

03:19.282 --> 03:23.661
That I am, and I'd be glad
to fix your bike for a price.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.332
I can fix my own bike.
I just need some tools.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.086
Have it your way.
But the tools are still gonna cost you.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.340
I don't have much in the way of credits.

03:36.007 --> 03:39.010
Don't worry. Down here, no one does.
Come on.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.095
[beeps]

03:47.977 --> 03:51.648
That's a <i>Nebula</i>-class freighter.
Or at least it was.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.525
Good eye.

03:53.608 --> 03:57.153
I'm turning it into something
with a bit more speed. I think.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.489
Your space is over there.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.950
Why don't you get that thing inside
and settle in?

04:02.784 --> 04:03.910
Thanks.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.538
Don't take too long. Time is money.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.751
Hey, why are you helping me?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.673
Shouldn't I?
Seemed like the right thing to do.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.300
You can leave if you want.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.761
No. It's all right.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.179
I'll stay.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.264
Thank you.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.975
That's good. I really need the money.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.952
How's it going down there? Need any help?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.954
Not if you're gonna charge me.

04:48.496 --> 04:52.959
Hey, I don't know where you're from,
but down here, everything has a price.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.628
If you're gonna stick around,
you better get used to it.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.798
Well, you might be in luck.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.761
This engine isn't going to run
without a new sparker.

05:02.844 --> 05:03.970
Got one I can buy?

05:04.846 --> 05:08.391
Got bad news.
The only sparkers I got are right here.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.477
And I ain't got no more.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.397
That won't do. I need to get out of here.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.984
Why? You running from something?

05:19.986 --> 05:23.865
Maybe this was a bad idea.
I don't know what I'm doing here.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.911
Hey! What did I say?

05:28.578 --> 05:31.498
Look, you can stay here
as long as you like.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.918
If you can pay me. What's with you?

06:16.084 --> 06:17.961
[engine rattling]

06:33.101 --> 06:34.310
[engine stops]

06:34.394 --> 06:36.855
No sense in keeping you here
if you're gonna be miserable.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.940
I appreciate the help.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.151
What's it gonna cost?

06:41.943 --> 06:43.069
It's on the house.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.908
You know, where I come from,
it's very different from here.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.705
Obviously.
So where do you come from anyway?

06:54.664 --> 06:55.707
I...

06:56.166 --> 06:57.167
um...

06:58.084 --> 07:00.962
used to live in
the upper levels of Coruscant.

07:01.671 --> 07:05.342
Ah, up there where the air is clear, huh?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.344
You're probably better off down here.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.179
Why's that?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.639
I'm sure you have your problems up there

07:11.723 --> 07:16.353
with the Jedi running around
starting wars, policing everything.

07:16.811 --> 07:20.231
The Jedi didn't start the war.
They're trying to stop it.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.942
Sure. Sure, they are.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.695
Look, it doesn't really matter anyway.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.947
They've forgotten all about us.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.949
What do you mean?

07:30.033 --> 07:33.912
It's just... when you're a kid,
you hear stories.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.456
I guess they're not
what I thought they'd be.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.419
It's not safe down here
or anywhere on Coruscant.

07:41.503 --> 07:45.924
That's why I've got my ship,
so I can make my living in the stars.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.134
Just me and my sister Rafa.

07:48.468 --> 07:52.722
We'll get away from the Jedi,
this war, all of it.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.559
Martez, your sister said
she was paying me today.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.061
Where is she?

07:58.728 --> 08:02.065
Let me handle this.
Don't do anything. Got it?

08:02.649 --> 08:03.983
All right.

08:04.359 --> 08:08.363
Hey, hey, Pintu.
Rafa said she was coming to see you.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.616
Well, since she's not here,

08:11.700 --> 08:14.202
I guess you're gonna have
to pay me instead.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.122
I'd back off if I were you.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.332
-Stay out of this.
-Stay out of this.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.294
Now, where's my money?

08:24.879 --> 08:28.383
I got it. Right... here!

09:25.607 --> 09:29.361
[breathes heavily]
Tell Rafa this is far from over.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.785
Whoa!
Where did you learn to fight like that?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.578
My older brother taught me.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.413
Maybe you can teach me someday.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.750
Come on, we gotta go
tell my sister about Pintu.

09:52.676 --> 09:53.677
Uh...

09:58.014 --> 09:59.015
Nope.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.354
-Meh.
-Rafa.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.986
Rafa, does that belong to you?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.072
Not yet.

10:15.198 --> 10:19.077
Oh, Trace! What happened to your face?

10:19.577 --> 10:22.497
Pintu came by to get paid.
You weren't there.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.040
You plan on paying him?

10:24.457 --> 10:25.709
I am.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.878
I got a big job coming through
that'll make everything good for us.

10:29.421 --> 10:32.424
Is it legitimate this time
or the usual job?

10:32.507 --> 10:33.883
Hey, what did I teach you?

10:34.467 --> 10:36.011
We can't count on anyone--

10:36.094 --> 10:38.638
So we count on ourselves. I know.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.308
That's right. That's how we survive.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.896
Who is this interesting creature?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.399
My name is Ahsoka.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.776
Lovely name, Ahsoka.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.988
Ahsoka, this is my sister, Rafa Martez.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.574
How'd you end up with this moof-milker?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.577
She fell from the sky. I mean, really.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.954
Dropped right in on the mech bay platform.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.665
Where exactly are you from?

11:06.458 --> 11:09.961
I'm from Topside.
Your sister's been helping me out.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.882
Really? [scoffs]
How much is she charging you?

11:14.257 --> 11:15.967
Not enough to pay your debt.

11:16.468 --> 11:20.638
Not that it's any of your business,
but I am sorry about that, Trace.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.225
You promised
you would stay away from Pintu.

11:24.309 --> 11:28.438
I needed money for this place,
for repairs and other things.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.274
You could have at least
given me a heads-up

11:31.358 --> 11:32.984
that you weren't gonna pay him.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.446
You're right. Won't happen again.

11:36.946 --> 11:40.367
Good. I can only take
so many punches to my head

11:40.450 --> 11:41.993
and still be considered a pilot.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.915
Here's our next payday.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.376
How can I help you, my friend?

11:50.126 --> 11:52.545
I've got three droids
that need to be built.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.216
My business partner
brokered a deal with a...

11:56.675 --> 11:58.551
a Rafa Martez.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.720
You're looking at her.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.639
And that deal will be honored.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.893
This may not look like a droid factory,
but that's to throw off the authorities.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.604
My associate does assembly in the back.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.606
Who's your associate?

12:11.690 --> 12:13.316
Don't worry about that yet.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.820
My, uh, business partner,

12:17.487 --> 12:20.615
he said you build droids
better than anybody.

12:21.074 --> 12:25.036
Then they know quality.
Look, just bring them 'round back.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.421
So, Trace, feel like building some droids?

12:43.805 --> 12:46.057
It's been a while since I built a droid.

12:46.141 --> 12:49.060
But it's not too difficult,
just more moving parts.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.355
Just make sure
you affix the restraining bolt

12:52.439 --> 12:55.442
to that pile of moving parts
before you punch the power cycle.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.152
Got one right here.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.195
What's your worry?

12:59.779 --> 13:02.782
I've had my fair share
of run-ins with droids.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.492
The majority are fine,

13:04.576 --> 13:06.828
but some are just cross-wired
from the start.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.622
And this is no astromech.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.500
[droid beeps]

13:14.210 --> 13:15.378

13:16.046 --> 13:19.007
You seem to know a lot about everything.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.508
Not everything.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.802
I still don't understand people.

13:22.886 --> 13:23.887
What's to know?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.389
There are good people and bad people,

13:26.473 --> 13:30.185
and some are just cross-wired
like this binary load lifter.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.730
Binary load lifter.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.068
Wait a minute.
I do know this type of droid.

13:39.402 --> 13:40.403

13:45.784 --> 13:46.785

13:52.123 --> 13:53.124
Are you all right?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.294
Type two load lifters were a fraud.

13:56.378 --> 13:59.756
They were repurposed demolition droids
prone to violence.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.341
Naturally.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.052
Well, good thing
we put the restraining bolts on.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.554
-[droid beeps]
-Trace, the bolt.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.955
No. That-- That's not...

14:32.831 --> 14:34.541
No, no. No, no.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.544
Trace, that's my droid. Where's it going?

14:38.128 --> 14:40.463
It's a test run. Nothing to worry about.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.424
This isn't funny, Trace!

15:14.289 --> 15:15.290
Yeah.

15:23.214 --> 15:26.634
Go back to Rafa's and get
the tracking device for that droid.

15:26.718 --> 15:27.844
What are you gonna do?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.596
Find a speeder and meet you there.

15:34.768 --> 15:35.769
Where's the droid?

15:36.394 --> 15:37.479
Working on it.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.522
Where's Trace?

15:40.648 --> 15:41.649
Gotta go.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.860
Trace, I trusted you.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.946
We're going to owe more credits
than we were paid for this thing!

15:48.490 --> 15:50.950
Stop. Stop. It's really close.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.410
Where? Do you see it?

15:52.494 --> 15:54.454
Yeah. It's headed straight for us.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.001
[screams]

16:02.879 --> 16:04.964
-[screams]
-[pedestrian] Hey!

16:11.137 --> 16:13.848
The off switch, it's on its face plate.

16:13.932 --> 16:16.101
Okay. But let me grab it first.

16:37.455 --> 16:38.456
Got it!

16:40.208 --> 16:41.209
[groans]

16:41.501 --> 16:43.211
See? Nothing to it.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.757
[Trace] Oh, no. This was a bad idea.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.342
Yeah, that happens.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.802
I gotta cut it loose.

16:51.886 --> 16:52.971
[computer beeps]

16:54.180 --> 16:56.558
-We can't let it get away.
-Take the controls!

16:59.310 --> 17:00.979
Just hit the blue button!

17:04.566 --> 17:05.567
[beeps]

17:09.237 --> 17:10.238
[grunts]

17:15.410 --> 17:17.454
Come on. Come on!

17:27.088 --> 17:28.214
[droid beeps]

17:30.967 --> 17:31.968
Hey, kid.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.433
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Ah!

17:59.120 --> 18:01.247
-Come on, you got it.
-There you go, all good!

18:05.251 --> 18:06.378
Bad. Bad.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.303
Look there. Look, they have it.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.147
Trace?

18:30.568 --> 18:33.113
See? Nothing to worry about.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.989
We had it all under control.

18:39.285 --> 18:43.373
I am not going to dismantle those droids.
A deal is a deal.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.916
They could hurt someone.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.836
Honestly, not my problem.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.213
You don't know
what those droids could be used for.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.216
They're dangerous.
One tore apart the sector.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.427
Without a restraining bolt.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.512
Trace, did you put the bolt on all three?

18:57.971 --> 19:00.265
Yeah, but what if one comes off?

19:00.348 --> 19:03.268
Why is this a discussion? We all know--

19:03.351 --> 19:05.020
That you're new here.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.694
Trace, I'll do the right thing.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.321
I'll meet you at the wharf, okay?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.490
Rafa, just be smart.

19:18.616 --> 19:19.701
Come on, Ahsoka.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.545
[driver] Wahoo!

19:38.261 --> 19:39.804
[soft music playing]

19:39.888 --> 19:41.806
[cat meows, purrs]

19:43.600 --> 19:45.560
Do you ever get a say with Rafa?

19:46.394 --> 19:48.313
She's my older sister.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.023
She doesn't always get it right,

19:50.106 --> 19:53.443
but I know she's trying
to make things better for us.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.071
At what cost?

20:03.119 --> 20:05.455
Did you tell that guy about the droids?

20:05.538 --> 20:09.250
Actually, I charged the Twi'lek double.

20:09.334 --> 20:10.960
You gave them back.

20:11.044 --> 20:14.464
You said be smart.
Look, they weren't mine to keep.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.384
We don't build them, somebody else would.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.551
I don't give them back,

20:18.635 --> 20:20.762
that's more trouble
for the Martez sisters.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.389
Rafa.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.767
I used the credits to pay off Pintu.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.103
If I didn't get the credits
for those droids,

20:28.186 --> 20:29.979
they were gonna keep coming after us.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.818
Here's enough to buy new tools.
That makes it worth it, right?

20:37.070 --> 20:38.154
I guess so.

20:38.697 --> 20:39.906
Stick with me, Trace.

20:39.989 --> 20:44.536
One day, we'll have enough credits,
Pintu will be coming to us for work.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.497
[music continues]

20:50.875 --> 20:52.961
I'd better go finish my speeder.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.879
You're not sticking around?

20:55.714 --> 20:57.674
I think it's for the best.

21:01.636 --> 21:02.637
Hey.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.892
Thanks for saving me out there.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.353
You're welcome.

21:11.271 --> 21:14.024
Now, let's get that speeder working.
Come on.
