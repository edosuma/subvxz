00:03.136 --> 00:05.900
How bad will it get
if they find out about you and Daunte?

00:05.971 --> 00:07.132
I probably won't play anywhere.

00:07.207 --> 00:09.835
Duke rescinded your scholarship offer.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.608
I applied for an internship at Sire Records.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.146
That's great.

00:14.214 --> 00:15.681
It's in Los Angeles.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.444
I was wondering,
why'd you leave Clean Teens?

00:17.517 --> 00:19.917
I thought if I join Clean Teens,
girls wouldn't be interested in me.

00:19.986 --> 00:22.181
And then maybe I wouldn't have
my heart broken again.

00:22.255 --> 00:23.449
And then I came along.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.514
- What are you gonna do, shoot me?
- Yes.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.583
Just like you shot my Uncle Keith.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.790
- Karen!
- Do not touch her!

00:29.863 --> 00:30.852
She could be having a miscarriage!

00:30.930 --> 00:33.125
I swear to God I'll kill you!

- Mom, are you okay?
- She could be having a miscarriage!

01:23.283 --> 01:24.272
- Do not touch her!
- Lucas...

01:24.350 --> 01:27.319
That is my mother!
I swear to God I will kill you!

01:33.126 --> 01:34.354
Get out.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.030
Lucas, she could lose the baby.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.931
I missed on purpose. I will not miss again.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.364
You're making a terrible mistake.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.803
Get out.

01:57.317 --> 02:00.343
Mom, it's okay.
I'm gonna get you some help, okay?

02:00.420 --> 02:02.149
It's gonna be okay.

02:05.024 --> 02:08.515
- We're gonna be okay.
- I know.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.722
This day just came earlier
than I thought it would.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.265
- What, graduation?
- No.

02:13.366 --> 02:15.391
The day I realized
I was never gonna play again.

02:16.402 --> 02:20.304
I called every school
that showed interest in me as a player.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.568
Nobody wants a point shaver.

02:29.415 --> 02:30.575
Luke.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.210
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.619
How's Karen? What are they saying?

02:36.689 --> 02:40.147
She's unconscious.
She has something called eclampsia.

02:40.226 --> 02:41.386
It gives her seizures.

02:41.461 --> 02:44.624
- What does that mean for the baby?
- It's pretty serious.

02:44.697 --> 02:48.599
They said the next few hours are critical
for the both of them.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.531
I just want her to be okay.

02:50.603 --> 02:52.662
She will be. Your mom is tough.

02:52.739 --> 02:55.173
Why don't I go to your house
and pack some things for her?

02:55.241 --> 02:57.869
- Okay.
- Does Peyton know you're here?

02:57.944 --> 03:00.674
You mind if I call her and let her know?
Okay.

03:01.614 --> 03:05.175
I... I don't want you to start worrying
and putting too much stress on yourself.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.843
Thanks. I'll be fine.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.080
Haley?

03:08.154 --> 03:12.682
You didn't happen to mention to anyone
that I had a gun in the house, did you?

03:12.759 --> 03:15.159
Yeah, I told Lucas earlier today.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.168
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.710
What's wrong?

03:32.445 --> 03:35.312
- Nothing.
- Come on.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.349
We're gonna be graduating soon!

03:37.417 --> 03:41.979
We all know graduating plus partying
equals Brooke Davis minus her clothes.

03:43.256 --> 03:45.451
But we're not all graduating.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.124
Rachel should be here.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.016
Hi.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.118
How's she doing?

04:25.431 --> 04:26.830
Not so good.

04:28.434 --> 04:33.337
The doctor says what she has could attack
her kidneys and her lungs, everything.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.899
- Hi, Peyton.
- Hi.

04:37.977 --> 04:41.606
Do you mind giving me and Lucas
a moment to talk?

04:41.681 --> 04:45.173
- Yeah. I'll go get us some coffee.
- Thanks.

04:52.358 --> 04:55.293
- What are you, on drugs again?
- Are you?

04:55.361 --> 04:59.127
Because there's a bullet hole
in the wall of your house, Lucas.

04:59.198 --> 05:03.191
Nearby, I found a shell casing
from a 9mm handgun.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.797
I happen to be missing a 9mm handgun.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.807
One you knew about.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.476
There's a police officer
about 40 yards down the hall.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.673
You wanna talk to him,
or you wanna talk to me?

05:15.748 --> 05:16.942
You'll think I'm crazy.

05:17.016 --> 05:20.474
I don't know if anyone's told you,
but I'm about as crazy as you can get

05:20.553 --> 05:22.521
without being committed.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.150
Try me.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.892
Dan killed Keith.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.828
It wasn't Jimmy Edwards. It was Dan.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.640
He got into the school that day
and he shot Keith.

05:41.708 --> 05:45.439
And there was a witness,
but she's gone now.

05:48.147 --> 05:50.138
Dan killed Keith, Deb.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.044
I believe you.

05:57.156 --> 05:58.418
You do?

05:59.459 --> 06:02.451
Dan thought it was Keith, not me,

06:02.528 --> 06:05.520
who tried to burn him
in the dealership fire.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.260
Oh, my God, what did I do?

06:11.304 --> 06:12.737
Who else knows?

06:12.805 --> 06:15.535
- My mom, but...
- Where's the gun, Lucas?

06:15.608 --> 06:17.599
There's a reason you didn't shoot him,
and you know it.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.304
It's not the way.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.858
I won't leave her side.

06:36.929 --> 06:39.727
If Dan tries anything, I'll be right here.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.858
You should go see Peyton.

06:43.202 --> 06:44.533
It's okay.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.137
Lucas.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.402
I'm sorry, truly.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.873
But justice will be served.

06:56.215 --> 06:57.944
I promise you that.

08:00.112 --> 08:04.014
- How's your speech coming, Haley?
- Not great.

08:04.083 --> 08:08.247
I'm trying to write about how we all
should believe in the good things in life,

08:08.321 --> 08:10.949
but it's feeling a little false today.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.385
I think I'm gonna take a year off.

08:15.461 --> 08:19.056
Can work nights and take care of the baby
while you take classes.

08:19.131 --> 08:22.658
- What about college?
- Without a scholarship we can't afford it.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.703
I'll just save up and I'll go next year.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.761
No, you'll go this year
and you'll play basketball.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.602
We're not giving up on that yet.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.699
Every college in America has.

08:30.776 --> 08:32.744
Hey, you know,
Skills is playing college basketball.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.542
Maybe he can talk to somebody for you.

08:35.615 --> 08:38.082
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

08:42.221 --> 08:44.052
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.648
- Hey, how's Karen?
- No change.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.559
- Is there anything that we can do?
- Yeah.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.460
It's your last day as high school students.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.125
You can go and be kids
for the rest of the day.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.462
I'm not leaving my mother.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.765
If anything changes,
I will call you immediately.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.327
I promise you.

08:59.939 --> 09:01.531
It's a good idea, Luke.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.303
You should go home, get some food,
take a shower.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.368
Yeah, you do kind of stink.

09:07.146 --> 09:08.408
Come on.

09:11.851 --> 09:13.011
You'll call me.

09:13.085 --> 09:14.609
- First thing.
- Okay.

09:14.687 --> 09:15.881
Lucas...

09:17.657 --> 09:21.218
Stay away from Dan. You understand me?

09:21.460 --> 09:23.655
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

09:30.603 --> 09:31.797
Brooke?

09:32.538 --> 09:34.631
Hey. Thanks for coming.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.072
Thanks for calling.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.609
Are you okay?

09:38.010 --> 09:42.970
I don't know. Karen's still in the hospital.
And there's something else.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.183
Okay... I think.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.756
I think I'm gonna turn myself in
for stealing the calculus exam.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.415
The day before graduation.

09:52.491 --> 09:55.824
I know. It's just...

09:57.196 --> 10:02.463
I was looking at the Honor Wall at school
and I don't belong up there.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.233
You know?

10:04.303 --> 10:05.895
There's nothing honorable
about letting your friend

10:05.972 --> 10:08.099
take the blame for something you've done.

10:08.174 --> 10:12.042
All right, I love you for that,
but what if they don't let you graduate?

10:12.111 --> 10:14.602
I mean, Rachel's already gone.
School's over.

10:14.680 --> 10:18.878
- What's it really gonna change?
- The way I feel about myself.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.016
And you just said you love me.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.716
- I did not.
- Did so.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.992
You just said "And I love you for that."

10:29.629 --> 10:31.256
So what if I did?

10:32.331 --> 10:34.026
And what if I do?

10:37.770 --> 10:40.898
Hey, baby. Got some good news.

10:43.342 --> 10:47.073
So, my parents want to have your parents
over before graduation tomorrow.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.137
A little quiche. Maybe some lawn darts.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.580
Baby, quiche and lawn darts?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.174
Do your parents know
my parents are black?

10:52.251 --> 10:55.152
Well, they don't know you're black,
so probably not.

10:56.055 --> 10:59.491
Stop it. Race has never been an issue
to my parents with any of my friends.

10:59.558 --> 11:02.049
Yeah, but was you having sex
with any of your friends?

11:02.128 --> 11:03.561
Do you really think
it's gonna be a problem?

11:03.629 --> 11:05.756
I mean, not for us.
But for our parents it usually is.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.059
Well, I'll just have to tell them.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.159
And if it's a problem, they're not
the parents I raised them to be.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.068
Hey, Nate. Bye, Nate.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.398
- What's up, man?
- What's up, dawg?

11:16.475 --> 11:18.875
- You hear about Luke's mom?
- Yeah.

11:18.944 --> 11:21.174
Figured I'd give the family some space,
you know.

11:21.247 --> 11:24.910
- Anything I can do?
- Not for them. Maybe for me.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.248
Oh, yeah, listen, Nate, man,
I talked to my coaches, dawg,

11:27.319 --> 11:28.616
and I don't think it's gonna work out.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.280
It's all right, man, I figured.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.519
But Haley mentioned to me that
if you didn't get your scholarship,

11:33.592 --> 11:36.356
there's a job waiting for you at the factory
where your dad works.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.418
Yeah.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.293
I thought if you weren't taking it,
maybe I could?

11:41.667 --> 11:43.760
Yeah. I mean, I could talk to Pops.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.098
- Can you go by there today?
- Yeah.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.866
Yeah, whatever it takes, man.
Just give me a call.

11:46.939 --> 11:48.634
- Cool.
- All right.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.040
- Thanks a lot, Skills.
- No doubt.

11:51.944 --> 11:53.434
Hey, yo, Nate.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.015
Sorry things ain't working out for you
on the court, man.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.950
Yeah, well, that's the risk I took, right?

12:00.453 --> 12:03.752
You commit a crime,
sometimes it catches up to you.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.590
Lucas.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.499
I understand you're really mixed-up
about all this.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.437
You're saying you didn't kill Keith.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.032
Is that what you want me to believe?

12:24.710 --> 12:28.703
Yes, Lucas, that's what I want
you to believe with all my heart.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.842
That's never gonna happen.

12:34.620 --> 12:37.020
You realize I'm in a lose-lose
situation here.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.751
If your mother doesn't wake up,
then I'll never forgive myself.

12:39.825 --> 12:43.022
If she does wake up,
then she'll never forgive me.

12:44.029 --> 12:45.394
Unless...

12:46.298 --> 12:47.925
Unless, maybe,

12:48.834 --> 12:50.665
somehow you're mistaken.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.769
No chance.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.572
I know what you did.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.636
And you know what you did.

13:01.413 --> 13:02.641
And maybe you'll never pay for it,

13:02.715 --> 13:06.845
but I promise you,
my mom's gonna know it, too.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.181
And what about her child?

13:11.257 --> 13:12.815
Keith's child.

13:12.925 --> 13:15.086
Another kid raised without a father,
like you.

13:15.161 --> 13:19.962
I had Keith until you took him from us.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.858
And I'll be there for his child.

13:23.936 --> 13:26.962
But you won't be, ever.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.100
I'm gonna make sure of that.

13:47.726 --> 13:50.593
You know, a lot of people go to therapy
to deal with stuff,

13:50.663 --> 13:53.427
but I say a good root beer float
can fix just about anybody.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.399
Fixes me up.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.627
Your parents coming back for graduation?

13:56.702 --> 14:01.298
No, they'd rather come back when
the baby's born, so I'll see them soon.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.102
How about your dad?

14:03.576 --> 14:06.340
Actually, I think I'm gonna take
that internship in California

14:06.412 --> 14:08.107
so he's just gonna meet me there in, like,
two weeks.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.546
Peyton, that's awesome.
I'm so glad you decided to do that.

14:10.616 --> 14:11.674
- You're gonna do great.
- Thanks.

14:11.750 --> 14:12.774
That's cool.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.821
Did Lucas say he's coming back here
before he goes to the hospital?

14:15.888 --> 14:20.518
All right, well, I'll get out of your hair
as much I hate to slurp and run.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.958
That's so good.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.255
Come in.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.431
- Hey.
- Hey, I was just getting ready to go.

14:26.498 --> 14:29.194
Oh, good. Hey, I got good news.
Skills hooked me up.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.463
- With his team?
- No, with his dad.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.301
He got me that job at his father's factory.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.069
- Well, Nathan, that's...
- It's good money, Hales.

14:38.143 --> 14:39.440
But it does start today so...

14:39.912 --> 14:42.073
So much for the last day of being a kid,
huh?

14:58.831 --> 15:00.298
Ms. Davis.

15:00.933 --> 15:03.527
Bit early for graduation, aren't you?

15:04.336 --> 15:07.100
I'm the one who stole the calculus exam.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.348
I'm really glad you came back.
I missed you.

15:18.517 --> 15:21.418
You think we could just stay here
for the rest of the summer?

15:21.487 --> 15:24.456
Yeah, there was a chance of that
till I took that internship.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.152
It's okay. I'm glad you did.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.491
Yeah, but it's gonna be a long summer.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.257
Nah, it'll fly by.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.657
You know, I...

15:36.635 --> 15:39.468
I really do appreciate you being
supportive about all of this,

15:39.538 --> 15:43.269
but a little bit of disappointment
would be good for my ego.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.235
I just want you to be happy, Peyton.

15:48.213 --> 15:51.614
You have so much magic in you.
I don't want to hold that back.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.549
But everything's okay?

15:58.057 --> 16:00.457
I wish we'd never left that hotel room
in Honey Grove

16:00.526 --> 16:01.652
because you're perfect.

16:01.727 --> 16:05.390
And we're perfect.
And that night was perfect.

16:06.165 --> 16:09.225
Well, saying that just earned you
another one.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.805
I gotta go back to the hospital.

16:17.176 --> 16:20.373
- Can I come with you?
- Sure.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.009
Just,

16:24.350 --> 16:27.285
let me hold you
for a couple more minutes.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.446
That's what's gonna fix me.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.940
Mr. Scott.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.177
Mr. Taylor.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.276
Charles. You ready to go to work?

17:01.353 --> 17:04.083
- Yes, sir.
- Right answer. Follow me.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.817
You know anything about
what we do here?

17:07.893 --> 17:10.327
Not really. Is it shipping of some sort?

17:10.396 --> 17:13.365
Of some sort.
We manufacture the steel that goes

17:13.432 --> 17:15.900
to building those freighters
you see coming out of the cape.

17:15.968 --> 17:19.165
At least that's what the company does.
We mostly just work.

17:19.238 --> 17:21.672
But if hard work doesn't scare you,
you'll do fine.

17:21.740 --> 17:24.071
Hard work doesn't scare me, sir.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.476
Another right answer.

17:26.545 --> 17:30.777
But let's lose that "sir."
It's Charles or Chuck.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.650
Your name is Chuck Taylor? Like the shoe?

17:33.719 --> 17:36.313
More like the guy who's gonna work
your sorry ass to the bone.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.084
Grab the other side of that pipe,
Nathan Scott.

17:39.758 --> 17:43.250
Yes, sir. Chuck. Charles. Sorry.

17:51.837 --> 17:56.331
And that's the truth about
how I passed calculus, so...

17:57.276 --> 18:01.212
I'm guessing there's all sorts of mean stuff
you have to do now.

18:01.346 --> 18:02.370
Well, I...

18:02.448 --> 18:05.781
Just, before you do,
can I just say something?

18:06.218 --> 18:10.211
You know, when I was a freshman,
I wasn't a very good person.

18:10.289 --> 18:14.282
I mean, sure I was popular
and dating seniors, but as a person,

18:14.359 --> 18:16.452
I was pretty lost.

18:16.528 --> 18:20.055
And over the last four years,
I've been forced to grow up.

18:20.132 --> 18:24.569
I stopped letting boys define me
and I started believing in myself

18:24.636 --> 18:28.470
and in my potential.
And I ran for student council president,

18:28.540 --> 18:32.601
and I designed a clothing line
and somewhere along the way,

18:32.678 --> 18:37.115
the lost, little, party girl
became the girl on the Wall of Honor.

18:37.883 --> 18:39.077
And...

18:40.252 --> 18:43.085
I know what I did was wrong, Mr. Turner.
I know.

18:43.188 --> 18:46.624
But the girl I was
when I came to this school,

18:46.692 --> 18:48.717
I'm not so sure she would have.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.262
And isn't that the point of high school?

18:51.330 --> 18:54.629
I mean, isn't that what you guys have been
trying to teach us for the last four years?

18:54.700 --> 18:58.830
Actually, we've been trying to teach you
not to cheat in calculus.

18:59.238 --> 19:02.071
But the rest of it
is certainly important, too.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.076
I imagine you've been feeling a good
amount of guilt over letting your friend

19:05.144 --> 19:06.805
Rachel take the fall.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.039
Yes, sir.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.138
I mean, even though she told me to

19:10.215 --> 19:11.773
and she's done all sorts of things
over the last year

19:11.850 --> 19:13.750
that would've gotten
her expelled anyway, so I...

19:13.819 --> 19:18.882
Yes, I... I have, so that's why I felt
that I should come forward.

19:18.957 --> 19:21.755
You know, Brooke,
I must seem ancient to you.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.125
Your teachers probably seem irrelevant.

19:24.196 --> 19:26.130
But one day you'll look back

19:26.265 --> 19:30.463
and things won't seem so
"us against them."

19:31.703 --> 19:34.228
I assume you're going to college?

19:34.306 --> 19:37.639
Yes, sir, I... Well, I hope so now.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.506
- To study...
- Fashion.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.443
Not engineering.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.311
Or anything requiring intensive calculus?

19:44.816 --> 19:47.444
- No, sir.
- Good.

19:48.887 --> 19:50.286
Go graduate.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.117
Really?

19:52.858 --> 19:54.689
Are you serious?

19:54.760 --> 19:56.159
Thank you. I don't even...

19:56.228 --> 19:58.423
Principal Turner. Principal Turner.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.625
Look, if you suspend her,
I think you're really making a big mistake.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.224
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to barge in like this but...

20:03.302 --> 20:04.997
Shut up.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.868
Chase, I love you for this,
really, but, shut up.

20:08.674 --> 20:12.405
I'm sorry. We'll... We'll just go. Go.

20:12.477 --> 20:13.671
Thanks.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.381
Deb.

20:19.451 --> 20:24.115
- Dr. Hudson, what's happening?
- Your mom's condition's worsened, Lucas.

20:24.189 --> 20:25.884
And we can't be aggressive
with the antibiotics

20:25.958 --> 20:27.255
because of her pregnancy.

20:27.326 --> 20:28.691
So, how do you help her?

20:28.760 --> 20:32.662
I wanna prep her for surgery
and deliver the baby by cesarean.

20:34.266 --> 20:37.963
And then everything will be okay, right?
With my mom and the baby?

20:38.036 --> 20:41.130
Well, we have to take
one life at a time, Luke.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.969
Right now, both lives are in danger.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.373
But if we act now, we can save the baby,

20:45.444 --> 20:49.039
and we'll have a much better chance
at helping your mom.

20:49.381 --> 20:52.578
I wanna be there with her
when you deliver the baby.

20:52.651 --> 20:53.982
Of course.

20:56.688 --> 21:02.854
Mom. We're gonna try to help you, okay?
Just, come back to us.

21:14.406 --> 21:19.173
- Hey, Coach. Are you looking for Nathan?
- No, actually, I was looking for you.

21:19.244 --> 21:22.975
- Care to take a little walk?
- Yeah, sure.

21:26.985 --> 21:28.953
How's Nathan holding up?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.749
Better than I am.

21:32.190 --> 21:35.182
Skills helped him get a job at a steel plant.

21:36.261 --> 21:37.250
I don't know, I just...

21:37.329 --> 21:40.059
I feel like it's way too early
for him to let his fire burn out

21:40.132 --> 21:42.464
and just give up what he wants,
you know?

21:42.534 --> 21:44.525
How about what you want?

21:45.537 --> 21:48.301
Look, Haley, you asked me to help Nathan.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.841
I'm not sure I can, but if I do,

21:51.443 --> 21:55.004
it's gonna take you away
from all the things you wanted.

21:55.547 --> 21:57.913
I remember you said something
about Stanford.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.679
Coach, I would go anywhere with Nathan.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.084
I would go to whatever school
will take him.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.022
As long as our family's together
and he's doing something that he loves,

22:06.091 --> 22:07.115
I'll be happy.

22:07.192 --> 22:08.819
You'd make that sacrifice?

22:08.894 --> 22:11.055
Yeah, wouldn't you have done
the same for Camilla?

22:11.129 --> 22:12.426
Well, sure I would have.

22:12.497 --> 22:16.194
But I never had to,
she always did the sacrificing for me.

22:25.711 --> 22:27.372
All right, here.

22:28.447 --> 22:29.709
Okay.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.178
Let's take a break.

22:34.619 --> 22:36.678
State Championship wasn't that long ago.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.814
- You can't be out of shape.
- I'm in game shape.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.916
Just not "steel-beams-for-the-rest-
of-my-life" shape.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.189
- You do this every day?
- No, I've been in management for years.

22:45.263 --> 22:46.855
I just wanted to see
what you were made of.

22:51.737 --> 22:54.205
And, by the way, this doesn't have to be
for the rest of your life.

22:54.272 --> 22:57.730
A lot of successful people
never got scholarships to college.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.743
Any of them point shavers?

22:59.811 --> 23:03.212
- Hey, how'd all that go down anyway?
- I was in over my head.

23:03.281 --> 23:08.241
I just needed money and the rest is a
perfectly orchestrated series of screw-ups.

23:09.321 --> 23:13.087
- You... You regret it?
- Every day.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.893
'Cause you got caught?

23:18.096 --> 23:20.291
Look, Mr. Taylor,
you seem like a good man.

23:20.365 --> 23:24.563
But the thing is, I made a mistake,
and now I'm paying for it.

23:24.636 --> 23:28.504
Those 32 minutes should not
define me for the rest of my life.

23:30.675 --> 23:35.044
I was hoping you'd say that.
Now all you gotta do is believe it.

23:35.113 --> 23:36.842
Let's get back to work, all-star.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.849
All right, let's do it, Chuck.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.885
By the way, I'm supposed to be meeting

23:40.952 --> 23:42.977
my son's girlfriend
and her family tomorrow.

23:43.054 --> 23:44.146
Anything I should know?

23:44.222 --> 23:47.555
- Your parents don't know Bevin's white?
- It never came up.

23:47.626 --> 23:52.393
- And her parents don't know you're black?
- Look, they're serving quiche, dawg.

23:53.198 --> 23:54.290
Can I go to this thing?

23:54.366 --> 23:56.698
'Cause it sounds like it's gonna be
an awesome disaster.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.065
Great. Laugh it up.

23:58.136 --> 24:01.128
I'm just playing around.
It's probably not even a big deal.

24:01.206 --> 24:03.970
I mean, if I were her parents,
I'd be more worried about you being you,

24:04.042 --> 24:05.839
than you being black.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.079
Oh, priceless.

24:12.150 --> 24:15.347
"Mr. Turner, if you suspend her,
you're making a huge mistake."

24:15.420 --> 24:17.217
I was trying to help.

24:17.556 --> 24:20.286
I know. You were very cute.

24:20.826 --> 24:23.659
I couldn't just stand by
and let you not graduate.

24:23.829 --> 24:26.627
Besides, it got you to say you love me.

24:26.698 --> 24:28.495
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

24:28.567 --> 24:34.130
You told me to shut up, and then you said,
"I love you for this, but go."

24:35.407 --> 24:37.034
So what if I did?

24:39.845 --> 24:41.437
So what if I do?

24:43.014 --> 24:44.072
Hey.

24:45.417 --> 24:47.351
Are we really gonna do this?

24:47.419 --> 24:49.114
You mean kiss? I hope so.

24:49.187 --> 24:54.215
No, I mean,
get all blissed out on each other like

24:55.193 --> 24:58.959
right before I leave for the summer
and we go to college and...

24:59.030 --> 25:00.588
Why not?

25:00.665 --> 25:04.260
- 'Cause it's gonna suck when we're apart.
- Yeah.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.566
But it's gonna be great when we're not.

25:09.241 --> 25:12.608
Besides, I'm gonna send you
the dirtiest text messages.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.338
- Promise?
- Yeah.

25:14.880 --> 25:19.010
You're so sweet, promising to type me
filthy things with your thumbs.

25:19.084 --> 25:21.518
Hey, anything for the girl I love.

25:37.168 --> 25:38.760
- Nathan?
- Hey.

25:38.837 --> 25:41.772
- Hey. How'd it go?
- Fine.

25:42.674 --> 25:45.040
Hey, will you listen to this part
of my speech and tell me if it works?

25:45.110 --> 25:46.168
Yeah, sure. Let's hear it.

25:46.244 --> 25:49.179
Okay. "Now is the time for us to shine.

25:49.247 --> 25:53.274
"A time when dreams are within reach
and possibilities vast.

25:53.351 --> 25:55.876
"Now is the time for all of us
to become the people

25:55.954 --> 25:58.388
"we have always dreamed of being."

26:25.817 --> 26:27.808
Stop. Stop.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.528
It's a girl.

27:17.702 --> 27:21.536
- It's a girl?
- Lucas, say hello to your sister.

27:53.638 --> 27:54.662
Hi.

27:55.540 --> 27:58.031
Oh, look how beautiful she is.

27:58.109 --> 27:59.940
Yeah, I'm afraid to move her,
I'm gonna break her.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.138
You're not gonna break her.

28:02.213 --> 28:03.942
You wanna hold her?

28:04.916 --> 28:06.042
Yeah.

28:10.321 --> 28:12.380
Okay, support her head.

28:12.457 --> 28:14.084
Come here, you.

28:14.159 --> 28:15.183
Hi.

28:18.897 --> 28:21.661
Oh! Let's see her.

28:21.733 --> 28:22.757
Hi.

28:23.568 --> 28:24.694
She's so pretty.

28:24.769 --> 28:28.500
Wow. I'm officially scared to death again.

28:30.775 --> 28:32.572
How's your mom doing?

28:33.178 --> 28:37.376
She's still unconscious, but stable.
They said she did great.

28:38.783 --> 28:41.513
Hey, I was wondering if you'd be able
to step out for a minute?

28:43.621 --> 28:45.384
Go ahead. I'll watch her.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.186
It's just a minute?

28:48.059 --> 28:50.027
I'll be right back, Mom.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.260
And you.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.463
And you.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.061
Unbelievable.

29:07.712 --> 29:11.148
Okay, I wanted to give you this
before graduation.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.176
Okay.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.843
I got you something for you, too,
but it's at the house.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.784
Actually, that's not from me.
That's from your mom.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.983
She just hid it with me
so you wouldn't find it.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.662
What book is it?

29:28.666 --> 29:30.065
It's my novel.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.227
What?

29:32.303 --> 29:33.930
She had it bound for me.

29:34.005 --> 29:36.030
I didn't even know she knew
I was writing it.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.096
When did you...

29:37.876 --> 29:41.835
Well, I guess there's not too much
your mom doesn't know about your life.

29:43.381 --> 29:46.009
"Lucas. I'm so proud of you.
Your words are wonderful.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.279
"Don't be afraid to share them
with the world.

29:48.353 --> 29:50.514
"Follow through and finish this.

29:50.588 --> 29:55.150
"Remember,
'There is a tide in the affairs of men."'

29:57.095 --> 29:58.528
It's <i>Julius Caesar.</i>

29:58.596 --> 30:01.497
Do you remember
when you gave me that book?

30:04.836 --> 30:07.634
Wow! <i>Julius Caesar.</i>

30:07.705 --> 30:11.436
"There's a tide in the affairs of men."
Or something like that.

30:18.116 --> 30:19.583
"Love, Mom."

30:21.853 --> 30:24.788
I really need her
to be my mom again, Haley.

30:25.557 --> 30:26.956
She will be.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.157
I know it.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.366
<i>Wheelchair to Maternity.</i>

30:44.442 --> 30:46.876
<i>Wheelchair to the maternity floor.</i>

30:48.046 --> 30:51.447
Pretty soon you'll have
a beautiful baby of your own.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.848
You trying to freak me out, Mom?

30:55.086 --> 30:57.884
Hey, by the way, if you can't make it
to graduation, that's okay.

30:57.956 --> 30:59.890
At least Dad'll be there.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.186
No.

31:01.759 --> 31:04.819
If you see your father,
I want you to stay away from him.

31:04.896 --> 31:06.056
Why?

31:06.664 --> 31:08.154
Oh, Nathan.

31:10.134 --> 31:14.537
This is gonna be hard for you to hear
and the timing is horrible.

31:14.606 --> 31:17.200
But you're my son,
and I will always protect you.

31:17.275 --> 31:19.072
Mom, what's going on?

31:20.645 --> 31:23.079
It's about your Uncle Keith.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.594
Daddy? What's going on?

31:39.664 --> 31:41.859
- We had a slight change in plans.
- What do you mean?

31:41.933 --> 31:44.629
Well, your mother wanted quiche.
I hate quiche.

31:45.303 --> 31:47.635
Well, I have something to tell you.

31:47.705 --> 31:49.195
My boyfriend's black.

31:49.274 --> 31:52.732
That's okay, honey, my son's black, too.
We deal with it.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.744
- But...
- Bevin Evan Mirsky,

31:54.812 --> 31:57.110
- you are in so much trouble.
- Why?

31:57.181 --> 31:59.843
Because if you had introduced us
to Antwon sooner,

31:59.918 --> 32:02.216
we would've met his parents sooner.

32:02.287 --> 32:03.413
Hi, baby.

32:03.488 --> 32:05.854
Antwon! Get your butt out here

32:05.924 --> 32:08.484
and introduce us
to your beautiful girlfriend.

32:08.559 --> 32:11.392
All right, everyone, just step back
and observe the master.

32:11.462 --> 32:12.486
Here we go.

32:12.563 --> 32:13.996
I was looking forward to quiche.

32:14.065 --> 32:15.396
You see?

32:15.466 --> 32:16.763
Hey, baby.

32:16.834 --> 32:18.529
See, I told you there was nothing
to worry about.

32:20.705 --> 32:21.967
Hey, Mom.

32:24.008 --> 32:27.205
I just wanted you to know
how good you did today.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.102
You and Keith.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.644
She's so beautiful.

32:33.251 --> 32:35.116
You're gonna be proud.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.651
You see, you gotta wake up

32:41.659 --> 32:44.423
because she doesn't even
have a name yet.

32:45.897 --> 32:50.527
You never told me what it was gonna be.

32:51.202 --> 32:53.193
Luke? Hey.

32:53.271 --> 32:56.138
We should probably get going if we're
gonna make it to graduation on time.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.875
I kind of just thought I'd skip it.

33:03.748 --> 33:05.010
Okay.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.141
Before you do,
I think there's something you should see.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.987
If you skip graduation,
we're all gonna skip with you.

33:18.529 --> 33:19.655
Even me, Luke.

33:19.731 --> 33:23.861
Remember what you told me about
how much I'd regret it if I skipped prom?

33:23.935 --> 33:25.266
You were right.

33:25.336 --> 33:28.635
And I think your mom would want you
to graduate with all your friends.

33:28.706 --> 33:30.435
You can wait here or you can wait there.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.305
It's all the same waiting.

33:32.377 --> 33:35.938
I promise you I'll call. You should go.

33:37.048 --> 33:41.576
Come on, Luke.
We can't imagine doing this without you.

33:47.759 --> 33:49.021
Yes.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.466
Dad?

34:06.711 --> 34:08.940
I know you've been a bad guy, Dad.

34:09.013 --> 34:11.344
And for a long time
I wondered if you'd ever change.

34:11.416 --> 34:16.513
But lately I've seen you change.
And I've been so proud of you.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.822
But now they're saying...

34:21.958 --> 34:25.087
They're saying
that you killed Uncle Keith, Dad.

34:25.163 --> 34:28.155
Mom said it. And Lucas said it, too. But...

34:32.170 --> 34:34.536
I know they're wrong. Okay?

34:34.605 --> 34:37.597
Because I know you could never do
something like that.

34:37.675 --> 34:42.408
So just... Dad, just look me in the eye
and tell me that they're wrong

34:42.480 --> 34:46.780
and I promise I'll stand by you
because I love you, Dad.

34:48.652 --> 34:51.143
Just tell me they're wrong, please.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.421
I can't do that.

35:08.673 --> 35:10.334
What happened to you?

35:12.577 --> 35:14.807
What happened to you, Dad?

35:21.352 --> 35:25.220
The day Keith died, you died.
You understand me?

35:25.289 --> 35:27.120
My son will never know you.

35:27.191 --> 35:31.093
You stay away from my family.
And you stay away from me.

35:45.276 --> 35:46.470
Nathan!

35:53.751 --> 35:56.652
First time I've ever come to Keith's grave.

35:58.389 --> 36:00.516
I was visiting with Camilla.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.285
Looking for some guidance.

36:05.062 --> 36:09.522
I asked her to send me a sign,
looked up and saw you.

36:11.035 --> 36:15.904
You know, there's a crummy little school
about three hours from here.

36:16.874 --> 36:22.244
They haven't had a winning
basketball season in over 30 years.

36:22.313 --> 36:26.079
Gym smells terrible.
Nobody goes to the games.

36:26.884 --> 36:31.514
Man would be a damn fool
to take their vacant coaching position.

36:32.690 --> 36:36.091
Or a damn fool that just won
the State Championship.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.527
You're gonna coach another high school?

36:40.231 --> 36:41.459
College.

36:42.166 --> 36:44.191
Took the job this morning.

36:46.237 --> 36:49.297
How would you like to play for me
next season?

36:55.313 --> 36:57.873
- Thank you, Coach.
- Don't thank me.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.115
Thank Haley.

37:09.794 --> 37:11.284
<i>So, without further ado,</i>

37:11.362 --> 37:14.456
<i>I give you Tree Hill High's</i>
<i>graduating class.</i>

37:15.666 --> 37:17.065
<i>Chase Adams.</i>

37:19.937 --> 37:21.632
<i>Mitchell Asplund.</i>

37:23.841 --> 37:25.308
<i>Angela Brown.</i>

37:29.714 --> 37:31.238
<i>Brooke Davis.</i>

37:46.063 --> 37:47.928
<i>Sarah Huddleston.</i>

37:48.899 --> 37:50.696
<i>Marvin McFadden.</i>

37:55.039 --> 37:56.506
<i>Robert Moore.</i>

37:57.441 --> 37:59.102
<i>Bevin Mirsky.</i>

38:10.988 --> 38:12.478
<i>Peyton Sawyer.</i>

38:18.229 --> 38:20.288
<i>Robert Maxwell Scanlon.</i>

38:22.166 --> 38:24.134
<i>Jessica May Scarlett.</i>

38:24.201 --> 38:25.600
<i>Lucas Scott.</i>

38:31.342 --> 38:32.809
<i>Nathan Scott.</i>

38:38.449 --> 38:40.007
<i>Ariana Smith.</i>

38:42.687 --> 38:44.348
<i>Antwon Taylor.</i>

38:48.492 --> 38:50.357
<i>Ferguson Thompson.</i>

38:54.765 --> 38:58.428
<i>And graduating in absentia, Rachel Gatina.</i>

39:10.081 --> 39:15.815
<i>And finally, this year's class valedictorian,</i>
<i>Haley James Scott.</i>

39:33.137 --> 39:38.302
<i>Distinguished guests, parents,</i>
<i>and this year's graduating class.</i>

39:40.978 --> 39:44.812
<i>My best friend reminded me of a quote</i>
<i>by William Shakespeare</i>

39:44.882 --> 39:46.873
<i>that seems appropriate.</i>

39:48.219 --> 39:51.586
<i>"There is a tide in the affairs of men,</i>

39:51.655 --> 39:55.091
<i>"which, taken at the flood,</i>
<i>leads on to fortune.</i>

39:55.793 --> 39:57.124
<i>"Omitted,</i>

39:57.895 --> 40:02.457
<i>"all the voyage of their life is bound up</i>
<i>in sorrows and in miseries. "</i>

40:14.145 --> 40:17.774
Mayor Scott, would you like to hold
your beautiful niece?

40:29.994 --> 40:33.054
<i>"On such a full sea are we now afloat.</i>

40:38.736 --> 40:43.139
<i>"And we must take the current</i>
<i>when it serves or lose our ventures. "</i>

40:43.908 --> 40:48.470
<i>I think that what that quote means</i>
<i>is that life is short,</i>

40:48.546 --> 40:51.310
<i>and opportunities are rare.</i>

40:51.382 --> 40:53.350
<i>And we have to be vigilant</i>
<i>in protecting them,</i>

40:53.417 --> 40:58.354
<i>and not only the opportunities to succeed,</i>
<i>but the opportunity to laugh,</i>

40:58.422 --> 41:00.652
<i>to see the enchantment in the world.</i>

41:00.724 --> 41:03.420
<i>And to live.</i>

41:10.334 --> 41:12.165
Call Dr. Hudson! She's crashing!

41:12.236 --> 41:14.136
<i>Because life doesn't owe us anything.</i>

41:14.205 --> 41:18.369
<i>As a matter of fact, I think that</i>
<i>we owe something to the world...</i>

41:19.243 --> 41:22.940
<i>And if we can just believe that...</i>

41:29.487 --> 41:34.322
<i>I'm sorry, I have more...</i>
<i>I just think I'm having my baby.</i>
