WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:02.484
<i>To get ready for
the launch of our new podcast,</i>

00:02.562 --> 00:04.656
<i>we created a teaser to built excitement.</i>

00:04.726 --> 00:06.257
<i>It had definitely built mine.</i>

00:06.344 --> 00:08.244
Guys, this is a very big deal.

00:08.313 --> 00:09.846
A sample of what we've been working on

00:09.914 --> 00:10.947
for the last three months

00:11.015 --> 00:12.615
is about to be released into the world.

00:12.684 --> 00:14.083
Should we all click the mouse together?

00:14.152 --> 00:16.686
You can fly solo on this one, Al.
It's just a teaser.

00:16.721 --> 00:18.821
In high school, everyone
called me "The Tease."

00:18.890 --> 00:20.490
'Cause I was so good at joking.

00:21.860 --> 00:23.993
Okay, fine. I'll click it alone.

00:25.029 --> 00:27.063
And... teaser launched.

00:27.132 --> 00:30.399
Now, speaking of which, let's
talk about this launch party.

00:30.502 --> 00:31.400
I took care of the chairs.

00:31.469 --> 00:32.401
They're being delivered tomorrow...

00:32.503 --> 00:33.970
50 lawn chairs, just like you said.

00:34.038 --> 00:35.505
I didn't say "lawn chairs."

00:35.573 --> 00:38.741
I said "launch chairs,"
as in... for the launch.

00:38.810 --> 00:41.277
Yeah. No. I... I know.

00:42.981 --> 00:44.714
Oh, did you guys have a chance
to look at my speech?

00:44.849 --> 00:45.781
Uh, I did.

00:45.850 --> 00:47.984
I wept, and I have a few teeny edits.

00:48.052 --> 00:49.152
Speech is too long, Al.

00:49.254 --> 00:50.286
What are you talking about?

00:50.355 --> 00:52.421
It's 52 minutes...
right in the sweet spot.

00:52.457 --> 00:54.891
At the very least, you gotta
lose Ben's birth story.

00:54.959 --> 00:56.692
Especially 'cause it was such
a straightforward birth.

00:56.761 --> 00:59.095
No, no, no. The birthing process
is a metaphor

00:59.164 --> 01:00.463
for how this company came about.

01:00.532 --> 01:01.731
It's a must-keep.

01:03.619 --> 01:04.751
- Okay, yeah.
- Up to you.

01:04.813 --> 01:06.361
You guys are the best.

01:06.416 --> 01:08.437
Ooh! We got our first comment.

01:08.540 --> 01:10.806
It says...

01:10.909 --> 01:13.075
"PASS," all caps.

01:13.178 --> 01:16.279
Thanks a lot, JoeHeartsCalamari.

01:16.381 --> 01:17.513
It's just one comment.

01:17.615 --> 01:18.781
Yeah, but one guy said it,
but that doesn't mean

01:18.883 --> 01:19.949
other people aren't thinking it...

01:20.018 --> 01:21.784
for every one you see,
there's a thousand more.

01:21.886 --> 01:23.686
- I think that's roaches.
- Or racists.

01:23.755 --> 01:25.888
Well, maybe he meant "pass,"
like the opposite of "fail."

01:25.990 --> 01:27.723
Nope, just posted again...

01:27.792 --> 01:30.193
"To clarify... this podcast blows."

01:30.261 --> 01:31.627
Well, this guy clearly doesn't get me.

01:31.729 --> 01:34.564
We have nothing in common.

01:34.666 --> 01:36.910
Though, I do heart calamari.

01:42.207 --> 01:43.873
Hello, family.

01:43.942 --> 01:46.242
Ooh, Dad has his hipster shirt on.

01:46.344 --> 01:47.276
That's right, sweetheart.

01:47.378 --> 01:49.045
I'm headed to a Brooklyn watering hole

01:49.147 --> 01:50.379
with my co-workers.

01:50.481 --> 01:52.114
I'll probably be the only
one there without a mustache,

01:52.217 --> 01:54.750
so I need to make sure
I look extra cool.

01:54.852 --> 01:56.252
Now, has anyone seen my purse?

01:56.354 --> 01:58.254
Yeah, your recorder is on the chair.

01:58.356 --> 01:59.622
Ah, thank you, darling.

01:59.724 --> 02:01.357
I want to get Eddie and Deirdre on tape

02:01.459 --> 02:02.658
talking about the launch.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.393
I'm hoping, once they get
a few drinks in them,

02:04.495 --> 02:06.229
one of them will say something profound.

02:06.297 --> 02:07.930
Oh, I listened to your teaser,
by the way.

02:08.032 --> 02:09.131
- It's really good.
- Ha!

02:09.234 --> 02:12.239
- In your face, JoeHeartsCalamari.
- Who?

02:12.309 --> 02:14.387
Just some jerky troll on the Internet

02:14.472 --> 02:16.105
who left a very hurtful comment.

02:16.207 --> 02:18.407
Hey, since when do you read comments?

02:18.509 --> 02:20.309
You never used to care about
that kind of thing at Cheer Up.

02:20.378 --> 02:23.045
This isn't Cheer Up, babe.
This thing is all me.

02:23.147 --> 02:24.780
This is the very first thing
I've put out there

02:24.882 --> 02:26.315
that is entirely my vision.

02:26.417 --> 02:27.817
- It's...
- Exciting?

02:27.885 --> 02:29.652
I was gonna say "terrifying,"
but, yes, it's also exciting.

02:29.754 --> 02:32.655
Well, just try to remember,
you can't please everyone.

02:32.757 --> 02:34.357
Yeah. Tell that to The Rock.

02:35.093 --> 02:36.559
All done.

02:36.661 --> 02:40.162
Sweetie, do you think maybe
an Iroquois village

02:40.265 --> 02:42.131
should have more than one thing in it?

02:42.233 --> 02:43.733
How about a tepee?

02:43.835 --> 02:45.601
The Iroquois lived in longhouses, Dad.

02:45.703 --> 02:46.802
What about when they went camping?

02:48.239 --> 02:52.008
Well, how about a stream
or animals, trees, effort?

02:52.110 --> 02:54.410
Nah. This is fine.

02:54.512 --> 02:57.380
"Fine"? Did she just use the "F" word?

02:57.448 --> 02:59.415
It's like she doesn't even care.

02:59.517 --> 03:00.750
She's in the third grade now.

03:00.852 --> 03:02.518
That's when kids start to separate...

03:02.620 --> 03:05.021
smart kids over here
and cool rebels over there.

03:05.089 --> 03:06.722
Oh, my God. She's a cool rebel?

03:06.824 --> 03:07.957
She's gonna throw keggers.

03:08.059 --> 03:09.458
Are we gonna have to buy a lake house?

03:09.560 --> 03:10.960
Not if I have anything to say about it.

03:11.029 --> 03:11.940
Damn it.

03:12.019 --> 03:14.030
I'm gonna make sure
she crushes this project.

03:14.132 --> 03:16.966
Once she gets a taste of an "A,"
she'll be jonesing for more.

03:17.068 --> 03:18.868
I remember my diorama days.

03:18.936 --> 03:22.305
I could capture everything from
an ecosystem to a battlefield.

03:22.407 --> 03:24.440
They called me "Shoebox Schuman."

03:24.542 --> 03:25.941
But that's all behind me now.

03:26.010 --> 03:28.577
One day, you look around you
and see there are no more worlds

03:28.680 --> 03:30.046
left to conquer.

03:32.383 --> 03:34.684
He'll never make us buy a lake house.

03:34.786 --> 03:36.652
No.

03:36.754 --> 03:39.221
<i>With all our hard work
about to be out there</i>

03:39.324 --> 03:41.390
<i>for the world to hear,
I wanted to have a night out,</i>

03:41.459 --> 03:43.793
<i>just the three of us,
to celebrate and reflect.</i>

03:43.895 --> 03:45.361
And that's when I realized,

03:45.463 --> 03:47.830
it didn't matter who my father was.

03:47.932 --> 03:50.232
It's who I <i> thought</i> my father was
that mattered.

03:50.335 --> 03:51.267
Wow, Eddie.

03:51.369 --> 03:53.002
Who knew you had
profound stuff in there?

03:53.104 --> 03:54.437
I'm as surprised as anyone.

03:54.505 --> 03:55.871
That was beautiful, Eddie.

03:57.575 --> 03:58.641
Hey, what do you guys think
that guy's like?

03:58.743 --> 03:59.875
Who? Eddie's dad?

03:59.977 --> 04:02.011
Well, unless that P.I. gets back
to me, we'll never know.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.847
No, no. JoeHeartsCalamari.

04:04.916 --> 04:08.217
Probably a sad loser,
no love in his life.

04:08.319 --> 04:09.452
The only thing he's ever "hearted"

04:09.520 --> 04:12.021
is a ring of fried squid.

04:12.090 --> 04:12.988
Jerk.

04:13.057 --> 04:14.190
Why's this hitting you so hard?

04:14.258 --> 04:16.392
The guy's a loser.
Stop getting hung up on it.

04:16.461 --> 04:19.128
You're so right. Why do I care?

04:19.230 --> 04:21.397
I'm... I'm obsessing over some nobody.

04:21.499 --> 04:24.266
I don't care anymore.
I'm a grown-ass man.

04:24.369 --> 04:26.302
I'm gonna go tinkle. Watch my rosÃ©.

04:26.404 --> 04:28.404
Yikes.

04:28.506 --> 04:30.005
Lots of people say "tinkle."

04:30.074 --> 04:32.274
No, guy's gotten so sensitive.

04:32.343 --> 04:34.143
I used to be able to break
his balls all the time.

04:34.245 --> 04:35.678
Now I can't even lightly graze his balls

04:35.747 --> 04:36.846
without him freaking out.

04:36.948 --> 04:39.782
I know! I can't graze his balls, either.

04:39.884 --> 04:41.117
Can you imagine what Alex would do

04:41.185 --> 04:42.752
if we told him
he was being too sensitive?

04:42.820 --> 04:44.653
- He'd be a crying mess.
- Mm-hmm.

04:44.722 --> 04:47.423
And he doesn't even pretend to have
something in his eye, like a man.

04:47.492 --> 04:48.758
He'll cry looking right at you.

04:48.826 --> 04:50.192
He cried the other day when I told him

04:50.261 --> 04:52.161
he mispronounced the word "GIFs."

04:52.263 --> 04:53.629
I think it's "JIFs."

04:53.664 --> 04:55.531
Well, don't cry, but it's "GIFs."

04:58.002 --> 05:01.070
Oh, hey, Ben, what do you think?

05:01.105 --> 05:02.905
Soraya really nailed it, huh?

05:02.974 --> 05:04.774
She had a little help.

05:04.876 --> 05:07.777
Yeah. There's some good, um...

05:07.845 --> 05:08.911
concepts there.

05:09.013 --> 05:10.446
"Concepts"?

05:10.515 --> 05:12.014
What would you have done differently?

05:12.116 --> 05:13.716
Mom, I like the diorama.

05:13.818 --> 05:15.084
Ben.

05:15.153 --> 05:18.287
Okay, uh, for starters,
the Iroquois would never build

05:18.389 --> 05:20.089
a longhouse next to a waterfall.

05:20.191 --> 05:22.458
There's flooding, mist, ice hazards.

05:22.527 --> 05:23.926
You gotta put yourself in their shoes.

05:24.028 --> 05:25.327
Don't you mean moccasins?

05:25.430 --> 05:26.829
Do you want my help or not?

05:26.931 --> 05:27.830
Sorry.

05:27.899 --> 05:29.765
Your layout is smart, but...

05:29.834 --> 05:31.500
it lacks detail and movement.

05:31.569 --> 05:33.035
I would recommend a lighting component.

05:33.137 --> 05:34.437
Lighting component.

05:34.539 --> 05:36.071
I didn't even think of that.

05:36.140 --> 05:39.074
Look, Ben, I really want Soraya
to get a good grade on this,

05:39.177 --> 05:40.876
so it's gotta be great.

05:40.945 --> 05:43.712
What do you say you dust off the
old glue gun and help me out?

05:43.781 --> 05:45.514
Mom, I told you. I'm retired.

05:45.583 --> 05:47.783
But you're so good at dioramas.

05:47.885 --> 05:49.285
The one you did of Tiananmen Square

05:49.387 --> 05:50.953
moved Ms. Hemzik to tears.

05:51.055 --> 05:52.188
She was inconsolable.

05:52.290 --> 05:53.622
Come on, Ben.

05:53.691 --> 05:56.358
You can't tell me there's
nothing left in the tank.

05:56.461 --> 05:58.327
Okay.

05:58.396 --> 06:00.963
But we're gonna use real tree bark.

06:01.032 --> 06:02.832
- Okay.
- I'm gonna put on a pot of coffee.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.133
We got a lot of work to do.

06:04.168 --> 06:05.267
You're too young for coffee.

06:05.336 --> 06:07.703
It's for staining the paper.

06:07.772 --> 06:10.172
If you focus, I'll try my best
to be patient.

06:15.746 --> 06:18.581
Wow. That is so...

06:18.683 --> 06:20.883
clearly not Soraya's work.

06:20.952 --> 06:24.787
Well, maybe not entirely,
but not entirely mine, either.

06:24.889 --> 06:26.555
Shoebox Schuman?

06:26.624 --> 06:28.057
Don't call it a comeback.

06:28.159 --> 06:29.692
How was drinks, by the way?

06:29.794 --> 06:30.860
It was awesome.

06:30.962 --> 06:32.995
I actually got Eddie on tape
for the podcast

06:33.097 --> 06:34.697
saying something very profound.

06:34.799 --> 06:37.166
Listen to this.

06:38.402 --> 06:39.735
<i>Guy's gotten so sensitive.</i>

06:39.837 --> 06:41.303
<i>I used to be able to break
his balls all the time.</i>

06:41.405 --> 06:42.838
<i>Now I can't even lightly graze his balls</i>

06:42.940 --> 06:44.306
<i>without him freaking out.</i>

06:44.408 --> 06:47.476
<i>I know! I can't graze his balls, either.</i>

06:47.578 --> 06:49.345
What the hell is this?

06:49.413 --> 06:51.046
Why are they so into your balls?

06:51.148 --> 06:53.048
<i>Can you imagine what Alex would do</i>

06:53.150 --> 06:54.650
<i>if we told him
he was being too sensitive?</i>

06:54.752 --> 06:56.585
<i>He'd be a crying mess.</i>

06:56.654 --> 06:58.821
I'm not sensitive.

06:58.923 --> 07:00.222
Why would they say that?

07:01.292 --> 07:02.324
<i>You're</i> sensitive!

07:02.393 --> 07:03.659
Hey! Easy!

07:03.761 --> 07:05.194
You almost took out my chief.

07:05.296 --> 07:06.662
Ow!

07:10.411 --> 07:12.504
It's a really good diorama, Ben...

07:12.567 --> 07:13.866
couldn't have done it without you.

07:13.968 --> 07:16.102
I do not disagree.

07:16.171 --> 07:18.371
Al? Alex.

07:18.473 --> 07:20.640
Are you still listening to that
recording from last night?

07:20.708 --> 07:23.276
I'm alternating between that and Adele.

07:23.311 --> 07:25.678
We've both been hurt so deeply.

07:28.283 --> 07:30.683
Oh. Soraya, carpool's here!

07:30.785 --> 07:31.883
Whoa!

07:31.977 --> 07:34.244
Looks a little more like
an "A" project, don't you think?

07:34.346 --> 07:37.280
This has Ben's nerdy
fingerprints all over it.

07:37.315 --> 07:40.116
False. I used museum gloves
so that wouldn't happen.

07:40.185 --> 07:42.051
Make sure you show your teacher
this little clock.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.754
When you rotate the hands
to change it to night,

07:44.856 --> 07:46.356
the fires burn brighter.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.125
How am I gonna stuff this
stupid thing in my backpack?

07:50.195 --> 07:52.328
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Careful!
Benny, help her.

07:54.633 --> 07:55.832
Hey, random question...

07:55.934 --> 07:58.001
You don't think I'm too
sensitive lately, do you?

07:58.036 --> 08:01.371
Honey, I'm sorry your co-workers
said that stuff about you.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.505
You don't deserve that.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.873
You're avoiding the question.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.876
But there is
a bigger problem here, babe.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.646
I mean, if you can't take
constructive criticism,

08:09.714 --> 08:11.281
your company can never improve.

08:11.383 --> 08:13.016
You're right.

08:13.084 --> 08:14.918
You're right, and as long as
Eddie and Deirdre

08:15.020 --> 08:16.386
think I'm too sensitive,

08:16.488 --> 08:18.588
they're never gonna give me
that constructive criticism.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.424
So I need to show them
that I'm not sensitive...

08:21.493 --> 08:22.692
which I'm not, right?

08:22.761 --> 08:24.427
I don't know.
Honestly, I feel like, lately,

08:24.496 --> 08:27.063
I can't say anything to you
without you scoffing

08:27.132 --> 08:29.299
and slowly turning and
walking out of the room.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.107
<i>With the launch just days away,</i>

08:39.177 --> 08:40.876
<i>I knew how important it was
for Eddie and Deirdre</i>

08:40.979 --> 08:42.812
<i>to know that their leader
could take criticism.</i>

08:42.914 --> 08:44.347
Oh, thanks, Mark!

08:44.416 --> 08:46.583
You guys, uh, Mark
from the fitness app...

08:46.685 --> 08:48.551
he just told me that I have a flat butt,

08:48.620 --> 08:50.653
a weak chin, and chicken legs.

08:50.722 --> 08:52.255
Man, that guy knows how
to tell it like it is.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.656
That's incredibly mean.

08:53.758 --> 08:55.825
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
That's just Mark.

08:55.894 --> 08:57.527
He and I have a thing...
he criticizes me,

08:57.629 --> 09:00.196
and then I just laugh
and laugh and laugh.

09:00.265 --> 09:01.164
I actually love it.

09:01.266 --> 09:02.465
What is going on with you?

09:02.501 --> 09:04.801
That's like the fourth story
you've told like that.

09:04.903 --> 09:06.135
How many times can one guy

09:06.238 --> 09:07.604
go into the kitchen and get insulted?

09:07.706 --> 09:09.339
I guess people just like
to bust my balls,

09:09.407 --> 09:11.708
which I'm notoriously okay with.

09:11.776 --> 09:12.976
How about you, Ed?

09:13.044 --> 09:14.010
Would you like to go in the kitchen

09:14.079 --> 09:16.079
and have a go at my balls?

09:16.114 --> 09:17.113
I promise I won't cry.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.715
Wh... Wait a minute.

09:18.817 --> 09:20.116
Did you s...

09:20.218 --> 09:21.484
Did you rat me out?

09:21.553 --> 09:23.453
Are you wearing a wire? I trusted you!

09:23.488 --> 09:25.822
Hey, no one was wearing a wire.
I'll come clean.

09:25.891 --> 09:28.525
I forgot to hit stop
on the recorder last night,

09:28.593 --> 09:29.559
and I heard you guys talking about

09:29.628 --> 09:30.793
how you think I'm too sensitive.

09:30.829 --> 09:32.595
You, um... You heard that?

09:32.697 --> 09:35.832
Many, many times.

09:35.901 --> 09:37.333
Um, would you excuse me a moment?

09:37.402 --> 09:38.334
Sure.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:59.157 --> 10:01.024
I'm very sorry you heard us
talking about you.

10:01.126 --> 10:02.258
It will never happen again.

10:02.327 --> 10:04.394
We were just blowing off
some steam, Al. Honest.

10:04.496 --> 10:06.129
It's fine. It's fine. You know what?

10:06.164 --> 10:08.097
A good CEO needs to be able
to handle criticism.

10:08.166 --> 10:11.701
And to that end, we are
gonna read every single one

10:11.770 --> 10:14.003
of these comments on the teaser, okay?

10:14.072 --> 10:16.439
And once you guys see how it
all just rolls off my back,

10:16.541 --> 10:18.908
you'll realize that I'm not,
in fact, that sensitive,

10:18.977 --> 10:21.811
and that you can come to me with
any criticism that you have.

10:21.846 --> 10:23.913
It'll help make this company
way, way better.

10:23.982 --> 10:26.382
Okay? Sound fun, sound good, good plan?

10:26.407 --> 10:27.300
- No.
- Awful plan.

10:27.325 --> 10:28.251
Okay. Good.

10:28.286 --> 10:30.620
It shouldn't take long. There's only...

10:30.722 --> 10:33.323
232 comments?

10:33.391 --> 10:34.591
This is just for the teaser.

10:34.693 --> 10:36.125
Please, let's not go down this road.

10:36.194 --> 10:38.127
Oh, we're going down this road, okay?

10:38.229 --> 10:40.196
Come with me. Hey.

10:40.298 --> 10:42.332
Read me one.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.233
Fine.

10:44.302 --> 10:45.935
"This sounds like fun
for the whole family.

10:46.004 --> 10:47.704
We listen to podcasts during dinnertime

10:47.806 --> 10:49.038
so we don't have to talk to each other."

10:49.107 --> 10:50.340
Oh, that's nice. Back to work.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.209
No. The positive ones
don't serve the exercise.

10:53.311 --> 10:54.811
I want you to give me a mean one...

10:54.879 --> 10:57.113
a super, superduper mean one.

10:57.182 --> 10:58.214
I can handle it.

11:00.385 --> 11:02.018
"We put our dog down this morning.

11:02.087 --> 11:03.119
This was worse."

11:03.188 --> 11:05.455
Whoo!

11:05.557 --> 11:08.925
It does... It stings, but I'm fine.

11:08.994 --> 11:09.892
I'm fine.

11:09.995 --> 11:11.327
Great. Mission accomplished.

11:11.429 --> 11:12.328
Back to the grind.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:14.099 --> 11:16.332
Hold your horses. One more.

11:20.772 --> 11:23.640
There's my little diorama mama.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.141
Mnh-mnh.

11:25.243 --> 11:26.843
Nope, just trying stuff.

11:26.945 --> 11:28.645
So, how did the project go over?

11:28.747 --> 11:30.413
Oh, it was good. People really loved it.

11:30.482 --> 11:31.981
Feels nice to get a good grade, huh?

11:32.083 --> 11:34.884
Yep. My first non-gym "B."

11:34.986 --> 11:36.653
Wait. You got a "B"?

11:36.721 --> 11:39.322
That project belongs in
a friggin' museum.

11:39.424 --> 11:40.823
Did the teacher say why?

11:40.892 --> 11:44.627
I don't know. When I get a "B,"
I don't ask questions.

11:44.696 --> 11:46.896
W... Can you believe this?

11:46.931 --> 11:51.000
Mom, once the diorama is out
there, it's no longer mine.

11:51.069 --> 11:52.068
It's the world's.

11:52.137 --> 11:53.469
No, it's not.

11:53.538 --> 11:57.040
It's <i> ours,</i> and we deserve
an "A"... for Soraya.

11:59.177 --> 12:02.011
<i>Each comment was like
a knife in my heart,</i>

12:02.080 --> 12:03.546
<i>but I couldn't stop listening to them.</i>

12:03.648 --> 12:06.249
"The only good thing about this podcast

12:06.317 --> 12:08.518
is that it will definitely fail

12:08.620 --> 12:11.187
and ruin the terrible host's life."

12:11.256 --> 12:12.255
Another one.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.257
Alex, we've read 100 of these.

12:14.325 --> 12:16.059
And we have 132 more to go.

12:16.161 --> 12:18.027
Another one. Come sit closer.

12:18.129 --> 12:22.131
"This podcast makes me
want to gouge my ears out."

12:22.200 --> 12:25.101
"They gave the worst guy
on Cheer Up his own show?"

12:25.203 --> 12:27.303
"So, wait. Company is called 'Ajana'?

12:27.405 --> 12:29.172
Well, Ajana never hear this again."

12:29.240 --> 12:31.074
"I'd rather listen to a circular saw

12:31.176 --> 12:32.909
- cutting into another circular saw."
- "Middle finger emoji."

12:33.011 --> 12:34.641
"All the people in this sound ugly."

12:34.711 --> 12:35.745
- "If rotting cheese had a sound..."
- "Vomit emoji."

12:35.814 --> 12:38.848
"I beat cancer for this? # pissed."

12:38.917 --> 12:40.950
That's it. That's all of them.

12:40.975 --> 12:42.028
Did you hit refresh?

12:42.053 --> 12:43.252
- Alex...
- Do it.

12:44.456 --> 12:47.023
"Finally, a podcast
made for my brother."

12:48.293 --> 12:50.426
"My brother was born without ears."

12:54.599 --> 12:56.699
I think I'm gonna call it a day.

12:56.801 --> 12:58.301
It's 3:30.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.837
Alex, we still have to get ready
for the launch tomorrow.

13:00.939 --> 13:02.505
Al? Al!

13:02.565 --> 13:03.588
Just let him go.

13:03.627 --> 13:05.366
But that's my jacket.

13:06.795 --> 13:08.287
<i>Today was the day of our big launch,</i>

13:08.342 --> 13:09.873
<i>but on account of my hurt feelings,</i>

13:09.933 --> 13:11.975
<i>I was having a little trouble
taking off my robe.</i>

13:12.038 --> 13:12.971
Morning, family.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.106
Hey!

13:15.175 --> 13:16.810
Made you your favorite
breakfast, honey...

13:16.888 --> 13:18.554
steel-cut oats, cut-up banana,

13:18.623 --> 13:20.089
little bowl of syrup on the side.

13:25.396 --> 13:27.863
Dad, that cake is from
when Grandma was here...

13:27.966 --> 13:29.065
three weeks ago.

13:31.970 --> 13:34.770
Oh, come on, honey! It's gonna be okay.

13:34.839 --> 13:36.706
What am I gonna do with all these oats?

13:36.808 --> 13:38.074
Is Dad drunk?

13:38.142 --> 13:40.076
No, sweetie.

13:40.178 --> 13:41.310
Not yet.

13:45.316 --> 13:47.216
Hey, Alex.

13:47.318 --> 13:49.118
Whatcha doing there, Al?

13:49.220 --> 13:52.922
Well, yesterday I was soaking up
all of the Internet's insults.

13:52.991 --> 13:55.524
But today, I realized
I can change their minds.

13:55.593 --> 13:56.826
Oh, Alex, please tell me you're not...

13:56.894 --> 13:59.495
Replying to each and every comment.

13:59.530 --> 14:02.365
Look at this one... He says
the podcast is too short.

14:02.433 --> 14:05.034
"This is actually
just a teaser, my friend.

14:05.103 --> 14:07.169
The full podcast is much longer.

14:07.238 --> 14:09.605
All my best, Alex Schuman."

14:09.674 --> 14:11.207
He already replied.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.441
They all reply.

14:12.543 --> 14:13.776
I would read this to you,

14:13.845 --> 14:16.946
but it is a very,
very vulgar suggestion.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.882
"Dear sir or madam,
I am relatively certain

14:19.951 --> 14:22.418
my mother is not interested in that."

14:22.487 --> 14:24.153
Okay, forget these bozos, Al.

14:24.222 --> 14:25.688
This is a sign of success.

14:25.757 --> 14:27.089
If this many people hate something,

14:27.191 --> 14:28.791
it's gotta be popular, right?

14:28.860 --> 14:30.726
Like that fourth hour
of the "Today" show.

14:30.762 --> 14:33.329
Why don't you take today to recharge,
you know, maybe get some sleep?

14:33.431 --> 14:34.897
We will handle everything at work,

14:34.966 --> 14:35.965
and we'll see you at the launch party.

14:36.067 --> 14:37.199
I'm not going to the launch party.

14:37.302 --> 14:38.334
Alex, you have to come.

14:38.403 --> 14:39.402
Everybody's gonna be there...

14:39.470 --> 14:41.003
our investors and our advertisers.

14:41.105 --> 14:42.938
No. Do it without me.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.140
I'm having dinner.

14:44.242 --> 14:45.274
We need you there, Al.

14:45.310 --> 14:46.609
You're the face of the company.

14:55.820 --> 14:59.355
Ms. Whitney. Hi.
Rooni Schuman... Soraya's mom.

14:59.424 --> 15:01.791
We have met a dozen times.

15:01.893 --> 15:04.327
Of course. No, I... I remember <i> you.</i>

15:04.395 --> 15:06.896
I just wanted to make sure
that you r... Never mind.

15:06.964 --> 15:09.665
Uh, I just wanted to talk to you
about Soraya's diorama.

15:09.767 --> 15:10.633
Beautifully done.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.201
Thank you!

15:12.270 --> 15:14.937
I mean... I thought she did well, too.

15:15.006 --> 15:17.239
So, yeah, if we agree, why the "B"?

15:17.308 --> 15:19.575
You see these? All B's.

15:19.644 --> 15:21.410
But they're... But they're amazing.

15:21.512 --> 15:22.511
They sure are.

15:22.580 --> 15:25.214
Guess what else they have in common?

15:25.283 --> 15:27.283
Both parents are architects,

15:27.352 --> 15:29.585
Mom is an out-of-work
Broadway set designer.

15:29.687 --> 15:33.489
This one's dad actually makes
dioramas professionally.

15:33.591 --> 15:35.424
Okay. You caught me.

15:35.460 --> 15:38.427
I just got worried that Soraya's
going down the wrong path.

15:38.529 --> 15:40.730
She's really been phoning in
her schoolwork lately.

15:40.798 --> 15:44.233
Last week, on her math homework,
she just wrote "nah."

15:44.335 --> 15:46.235
Listen, I've got a lot of kids

15:46.304 --> 15:47.903
that are destined for terrible things.

15:47.972 --> 15:50.306
I have a set of twins I call
"the Menendez Sisters"...

15:50.408 --> 15:53.709
cold, cold eyes.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.344
But Soraya's gonna be all right.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.614
She's well-adjusted, social,
little bit of a mean streak,

15:58.683 --> 16:00.683
but, hey, that usually gets you
a homecoming crown.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.852
Really? Great.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.987
I mean, that's... that's good to hear.

16:10.361 --> 16:12.728
He'll be here.
He knows how important this is.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.397
Plus, he's got to be
out of sheet cake by now.

16:14.499 --> 16:15.698
I'm not so sure.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.767
I sent him that selfie of us,
and he responded,

16:17.835 --> 16:21.003
"They celebrated the launch
of the Hindenburg, too."

16:24.776 --> 16:27.076
Honey, why are you wearing
Soraya's security blanket

16:27.145 --> 16:28.544
on your head?

16:28.646 --> 16:29.979
Security.

16:30.047 --> 16:32.481
Okay, babe, I think I've figured
out what's going on with you,

16:32.550 --> 16:35.584
because I think something
similar is going on with me.

16:35.653 --> 16:36.986
Are you serious?

16:37.054 --> 16:38.687
It is one thing to mess with me,

16:38.790 --> 16:40.589
HeartsCalamari, but you
come after my wife...

16:40.658 --> 16:45.194
No. Babe, babe. I'm saying
this company is your baby,

16:45.263 --> 16:49.198
and my baby is, well,
our actual baby, Soraya.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.366
She's hardly a baby.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.034
She barely lets me even
burp her anymore.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.837
I'm just saying,
when something is yours,

16:54.906 --> 16:57.206
there's a lot of pressure
to make sure it succeeds.

16:57.275 --> 17:00.109
But sometimes, people
are gonna give it a "B."

17:00.144 --> 17:03.979
Yeah, or make comments like,
"If road kill had a sound"...

17:04.080 --> 17:05.314
You know what? Forget that guy.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.415
You know what I realized?

17:07.484 --> 17:10.453
If you have done everything
you possibly can

17:10.521 --> 17:13.155
to make sure that your baby
is ready for the world,

17:13.223 --> 17:15.290
you just gotta let them do their thing

17:15.326 --> 17:17.059
and trust that it'll all be fine.

17:17.127 --> 17:18.560
Did you just use the "F" word?

17:18.663 --> 17:19.962
Not the bad fine, the good fine.

17:20.064 --> 17:22.498
Oh, you mean like "foine."

17:22.599 --> 17:27.303
Your podcast and Soraya
are both gonna be foine.

17:28.973 --> 17:31.407
But what if it's not?

17:31.509 --> 17:33.309
I mean, I...

17:33.377 --> 17:35.711
I've put everything we have
into this company.

17:35.813 --> 17:37.346
And it's not that I'm afraid

17:37.415 --> 17:38.814
people aren't gonna like the podcast.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.983
I can handle that.

17:41.052 --> 17:43.385
I guess what I'm really afraid of is...

17:43.421 --> 17:45.821
if they don't, the company will fail,

17:45.890 --> 17:48.023
and I will have let so many people down.

17:48.092 --> 17:50.893
Alex Schuman, there is nothing
that could happen to you

17:50.962 --> 17:53.729
or this company that we can't
figure out as a family.

17:53.798 --> 17:55.664
And neither one of us is gonna fail,

17:55.766 --> 17:57.833
'cause we are good parents.

17:57.902 --> 18:00.936
And your podcast, babe,
is gonna be amazing.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.073
I hope so.

18:04.141 --> 18:06.509
Look, there's one person
who agrees with you.

18:08.112 --> 18:09.812
"Leave my daddy alone.

18:09.914 --> 18:12.081
He is the best, and you are a failure."

18:12.116 --> 18:13.059
Oh, my God.

18:13.084 --> 18:14.984
- Did Soraya write this?
- Yes.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.087
She's so cute and witty and loyal.

18:18.189 --> 18:19.722
But, man, she cannot spell.

18:19.790 --> 18:23.492
I know. "D-A-D-D-D-I."

18:23.594 --> 18:25.327
Three D's right in a row...

18:25.396 --> 18:27.229
probably never thought
they'd be together.

18:27.331 --> 18:28.631
What kind of school is this?

18:30.201 --> 18:33.969
So, what do you think, babe?
Should we get out of bed?

18:34.071 --> 18:35.137
Foine.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.242
Hmm. Frosting.

18:45.283 --> 18:46.348
That's it. We're out of time.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.950
What do we do? Do we say something?

18:48.019 --> 18:49.652
Do we make the speech?
I can make the speech.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.320
I think I can capture more of his
voice, but if you're feeling it...

18:51.389 --> 18:54.490
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to say a few words.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.193
"Watching my wife give birth
to our first child

18:58.296 --> 18:59.795
was both joyful and scary,

18:59.897 --> 19:01.564
though everything went
according to plan."

19:01.632 --> 19:03.956
Oh, thank God. Alex, you made it!

19:05.236 --> 19:07.169
Hi. I'm so sorry.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.871
I'm so sorry I'm late, everybody.

19:08.973 --> 19:10.005
I'm so sorry.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.308
You guys, this place looks amazing.

19:12.410 --> 19:14.777
By the way, I'm sorry that
I've been being so sensitive.

19:14.879 --> 19:16.879
It's just... I feel like
this company's my baby,

19:16.948 --> 19:18.180
and I have so much on my shoulders.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.648
It doesn't have to be that way, Al.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.083
Yeah. It's <i> our</i> baby, too.

19:21.152 --> 19:24.053
Yeah. I mean, maybe you're the
mother, but I'm like the ob-gyn.

19:24.155 --> 19:25.721
And I'm the father.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.957
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It's almost time to launch.

19:28.059 --> 19:29.425
You're not gonna be able
to fit in your speech.

19:29.493 --> 19:33.028
Well, as my partners told me,
that speech is too long.

19:34.565 --> 19:37.066
Everybody, can I have
your attention for a second?

19:37.168 --> 19:38.300
Thank you all so much for coming.

19:38.402 --> 19:40.035
I promise I'll keep this brief.

19:40.104 --> 19:42.638
As the great Neil Armstrong once said,

19:42.740 --> 19:44.707
"Let's launch this beyotch."

19:46.410 --> 19:48.243
<i>When you put your
heart and soul into something,</i>

19:48.346 --> 19:51.080
<i>it can be tough to release it
into the world.</i>

19:51.182 --> 19:53.015
<i>But if you've done your job,</i>

19:53.084 --> 19:55.317
<i>you got to trust
that it's all gonna be okay.</i>

20:02.660 --> 20:05.027
<i>There are always gonna be haters,</i>

20:05.129 --> 20:06.395
<i>but the important thing is</i>

20:06.497 --> 20:08.464
<i>that you listen to
the people that matter.</i>

20:10.034 --> 20:12.568
<i>And since this is just the beginning...</i>

20:12.670 --> 20:15.304
<i>I know I have a lot of listening to do.</i>

20:23.694 --> 20:25.772
Boom. A-plus.

20:25.829 --> 20:27.829
Yes! That's my girl.

20:27.913 --> 20:30.881
Another longhouse, huh?
What a specific curriculum.

20:30.983 --> 20:33.226
Ms. Whitney let her redo
her Iroquois diorama...

20:33.289 --> 20:34.151
Oh.

20:34.253 --> 20:36.186
...because it's not
about a perfect project,

20:36.288 --> 20:39.289
it's about you doing your own
work and giving it your all.

20:39.391 --> 20:41.625
I went a little overboard before.
I'm sorry.

20:41.727 --> 20:43.360
I forgive you... this time.

20:43.462 --> 20:44.394
Thank you.

20:44.496 --> 20:45.896
Now go watch something. You earned it.

20:50.135 --> 20:51.201
This got an "A"?

20:51.303 --> 20:52.669
Doesn't even have a door.

20:52.771 --> 20:56.940
I wasn't gonna panic,
but she misspelled her own name.
