WEBVTT

00:07.541 --> 00:08.710
There she is.

00:08.711 --> 00:10.364
Morning Sweetheart, how is the number?

00:12.667 --> 00:14.968
Inspirational.

00:16.504 --> 00:18.039
You spoil me.

00:18.040 --> 00:19.974
So have a heart attack.

00:19.975 --> 00:22.176
I'm gonna try adjusting your dose.

00:22.177 --> 00:23.778
How long have you been awake?

00:23.779 --> 00:25.179
I never really slept.

00:25.180 --> 00:28.249
Yeah, I could feel you obsessing all night.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.384
I'm sorry.

00:30.385 --> 00:31.752
Problems at the office.

00:31.753 --> 00:34.522
Aw, poor you.

00:34.523 --> 00:36.858
I'm about to replace a
nine-year-old's liver.

00:36.859 --> 00:39.060
Oh.

00:39.061 --> 00:42.263
Remember... 30 minutes of cardio.

00:42.264 --> 00:45.231
Do I get to pick which kind?

00:49.737 --> 00:51.873
Inflation looks fine.

00:51.874 --> 00:53.875
But tell BLS I want those wage numbers

00:53.876 --> 00:56.277
as soon as they come in. Oh, Andy...

00:56.278 --> 01:00.081
have my cappuccino ready
when I get to the office.

01:00.082 --> 01:01.849
Let me bottom-line this for you:

01:01.850 --> 01:03.317
you want the first lady to use

01:03.318 --> 01:04.919
your flowers in her arrangements,

01:04.920 --> 01:06.587
grow 'em in America.

01:06.588 --> 01:09.624
Senator... Senator, I think
the national science advisor

01:09.625 --> 01:12.727
is a little more qualified
to speak on this topic.

01:12.728 --> 01:16.663
Well for starters, he's a scientist.

01:20.368 --> 01:23.404
Senator, I'm gonna have to call you back.

01:29.343 --> 01:31.644
Okay.

01:33.347 --> 01:36.017
Okay.

01:36.018 --> 01:37.551
That'll work.

01:37.552 --> 01:39.553
A meeting at 7:00 a.m.

01:39.554 --> 01:41.622
On a Monday. I mean, who does that?

01:41.623 --> 01:45.359
â™ªBesides you. That would be the
president's cybersecurity czar.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.161
He does know he's not
an actual czar, right?

01:47.162 --> 01:48.296
Yes.

01:48.297 --> 01:50.965
If he was an actual
czar, he would delegate.

01:50.966 --> 01:53.100
- He's briefing us in person.
- Why would he do that?

01:53.101 --> 01:55.436
Ah. Take a wild guess.

01:58.740 --> 02:00.141
Oh, good morning.

02:00.142 --> 02:02.510
- Morning.
- Early morning.

02:02.511 --> 02:05.646
So let's make this, uh, brief.

02:05.647 --> 02:08.582
Of course. Uh, major government breaches,

02:08.583 --> 02:11.252
including the one at OPM,

02:11.253 --> 02:12.887
have been traced

02:12.888 --> 02:14.855
to personal accounts on UNCLASS

02:14.856 --> 02:17.825
government computers.
So, starting tomorrow,

02:17.826 --> 02:19.894
the State Department and
other government agencies

02:19.895 --> 02:21.395
will expand

02:21.396 --> 02:24.031
the two-step verification
system from SIPRNet

02:24.032 --> 02:25.499
to all personal accounts accessed

02:25.500 --> 02:27.335
on government computers, including

02:27.336 --> 02:29.537
e-mail, banking, and social media.

02:29.538 --> 02:33.240
So I need a 16-digit,
alphanumeric password

02:33.241 --> 02:34.842
just to log in to Facebook?

02:34.843 --> 02:36.911
Or compose a tweet? That's ridiculous.

02:36.912 --> 02:38.079
So is Facebook.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.581
Okay, Inspector Gadget.

02:40.582 --> 02:43.250
- Any other questions?
- Um, yes.

02:43.251 --> 02:45.987
Do I need to worry about my car

02:45.988 --> 02:49.155
being hacked remotely?

02:51.258 --> 02:53.260
I heard it's a thing.

02:53.261 --> 02:54.795
Mr. Moran.

02:54.796 --> 02:56.998
Honestly, yes.

02:56.999 --> 02:59.900
If you want to play it safe,
you can bike to work, like me.

02:59.901 --> 03:01.302
Uh, Mr. Shaw, you're needed

03:01.303 --> 03:03.337
immediately at the White House.

03:03.338 --> 03:04.472
Is the secretary coming?

03:04.473 --> 03:06.773
She'll meet you there.

03:08.609 --> 03:10.344
I'm gonna have to cancel
tonight, I'm sorry.

03:10.345 --> 03:11.645
What is it?

03:11.646 --> 03:14.115
It's complicated. I...
I mean, it's classified.

03:14.116 --> 03:16.851
- Sorry.
- It's fine. You should go.

03:16.852 --> 03:18.251
I'll call you.

03:20.254 --> 03:24.524
Uh... Uh, can someone give me a ride?

03:26.360 --> 03:28.629
My apologies, Mr. President.

03:28.630 --> 03:31.932
All right, let's get started.

03:31.933 --> 03:33.634
Director Ware?

03:33.635 --> 03:35.770
As you know, we've had a lot
of near misses in the hunt

03:35.771 --> 03:38.372
for George Lasko, aka Dash,

03:38.373 --> 03:41.876
the man responsible for the
cyber attack on Air Force One.

03:41.877 --> 03:44.612
One hour ago, we pinpointed his location

03:44.613 --> 03:46.814
in Koh Kong, Cambodia.

03:46.815 --> 03:49.650
Is this human or signals intelligence?

03:49.651 --> 03:51.485
It's both. Mr. Shaw?

03:51.486 --> 03:54.155
Two weeks ago, we got a
tip from an ex-associate

03:54.156 --> 03:56.323
that Dash was somewhere in Southeast Asia.

03:56.324 --> 03:57.858
So I designed an algorithm

03:57.859 --> 03:59.527
to hunt through Interpol
surveillance footage.

03:59.528 --> 04:01.896
And using that search tool, CIA

04:01.897 --> 04:04.432
focused its attention on ports of entry.

04:04.433 --> 04:06.300
Today we got a hit.

04:06.301 --> 04:08.903
This is Lasko entering Cambodia

04:08.904 --> 04:10.838
yesterday under an assumed name.

04:10.839 --> 04:14.108
We traced that same name to
a location near this river,

04:14.109 --> 04:16.177
where we believe he is still residing.

04:16.178 --> 04:18.079
How long do we have?

04:18.079 --> 04:20.147
Not long. Ever since the attack,

04:20.148 --> 04:23.017
Dash has never stayed in one
place for more than 48 hours.

04:23.018 --> 04:25.619
And this footage is already a day old.

04:25.620 --> 04:27.455
Sir, SEAL Team 4

04:27.456 --> 04:30.124
is on a JSOTF mission in the Philippines.

04:30.125 --> 04:33.227
We could redeploy them to the
target in less than three hours.

04:33.228 --> 04:35.729
In a highly sensitive area.

04:35.730 --> 04:37.198
Your point being?

04:37.199 --> 04:40.067
A military extraction is risky.

04:40.068 --> 04:41.602
Loud and m-messy.

04:41.603 --> 04:44.371
I would suggest a CIA Ops team.

04:44.372 --> 04:45.606
Small,

04:45.607 --> 04:47.541
- quiet and effective.
- Like the one in Turkey,

04:47.542 --> 04:49.543
that left one American dead.

04:49.544 --> 04:52.646
Um...

04:52.647 --> 04:54.482
Ephraim, how-how quickly

04:54.483 --> 04:56.150
could we get a Black Ops team ready?

04:56.151 --> 04:58.385
Nearest assets are at Bangkok Station.

04:58.386 --> 04:59.835
12 hours, minimum.

04:59.836 --> 05:02.756
- All the more reason to send in the SEALs.
- Mr. President,

05:02.757 --> 05:05.126
our relationship with Cambodia is crucial

05:05.127 --> 05:06.627
to keeping China in check.

05:06.628 --> 05:09.263
We go in guns blazing, and
we're dealing with more than

05:09.264 --> 05:11.398
just a few broken windows...
we're looking at the death

05:11.399 --> 05:14.835
of our diplomatic strategy in the Pacific.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.670
Honestly, who cares?

05:16.671 --> 05:19.573
This guy hacked Air Force One.

05:19.574 --> 05:22.543
I'm with Craig on this. Get Dash now,

05:22.544 --> 05:24.377
mend fences later.

05:25.679 --> 05:27.047
I agree with Secretary McCord.

05:27.048 --> 05:28.682
The quieter the better.

05:28.683 --> 05:31.744
- Go on.
- Look, we have two objectives here.

05:31.745 --> 05:33.988
We want to get the man,
sure. But we also need

05:33.989 --> 05:35.589
access to his data. That's the only way

05:35.590 --> 05:37.258
to find out the truth about what happened

05:37.259 --> 05:39.593
with Air Force One. If anything
happens to his equipment

05:39.594 --> 05:40.961
or if Dash gets killed...

05:40.962 --> 05:43.164
We'll be back to square one.

05:43.165 --> 05:44.964
Point taken.

05:47.434 --> 05:50.236
Let's let the CIA take the
lead on this one, Craig.

05:53.140 --> 05:55.308
Better hope to God he's still there.

05:56.343 --> 05:57.978
You heard the news about Admiral Hill,

05:57.979 --> 05:59.480
I'm assuming?

05:59.481 --> 06:03.150
Yes. I'll, uh, be sad to see her go.

06:03.151 --> 06:05.119
Yeah, I won't.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.155
Hill and Secretary McCord
were natural allies.

06:08.156 --> 06:09.557
Have a seat. Coffee?

06:09.558 --> 06:11.358
Uh... yes, please.

06:11.359 --> 06:12.626
With the admiral gone,

06:12.627 --> 06:14.261
there's room for a new voice

06:14.262 --> 06:16.664
that comports with
POTUS's better instincts.

06:16.665 --> 06:17.998
Meaning yours.

06:17.999 --> 06:20.501
Yours, too.

06:20.502 --> 06:23.537
That little Cuba stunt notwithstanding.

06:23.538 --> 06:24.838
I don't follow.

06:24.839 --> 06:27.474
Sure you do.

06:27.475 --> 06:29.310
You and Senator Parisi

06:29.311 --> 06:31.278
tried to sabotage the Cuba deal.

06:31.279 --> 06:32.846
That's absurd.

06:32.847 --> 06:35.015
Do you really think I would

06:35.016 --> 06:36.517
stab the president in the back?

06:36.518 --> 06:39.186
I know you did.

06:39.187 --> 06:42.690
But you're lucky.

06:42.691 --> 06:44.458
We've got an election coming up.

06:44.459 --> 06:47.228
We can't afford another
Andrew Munsey situation.

06:47.229 --> 06:49.930
So you get a pass. One.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.932
In other words, you have no proof...

06:51.933 --> 06:55.302
for whatever it is you think I did.

06:55.303 --> 06:58.439
McCord knows about Cuba, too.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.108
She wants to go to the president.

07:01.109 --> 07:05.045
Your word against his star pupil from CIA?

07:05.046 --> 07:08.616
I don't like your odds there, sport.

07:08.617 --> 07:11.352
I shut her down, obviously, but...

07:11.353 --> 07:13.653
I expect something in return.

07:15.022 --> 07:17.024
Right now...

07:17.025 --> 07:20.127
she thinks I'm working against you.

07:20.128 --> 07:22.129
But if we play our cards right,

07:22.130 --> 07:23.530
we can turn the tables.

07:23.531 --> 07:25.566
Box her out for good.

07:25.567 --> 07:27.934
Which you want because?

07:29.803 --> 07:32.673
Because of that extraction in Cambodia,

07:32.674 --> 07:34.441
which is just the latest example

07:34.442 --> 07:36.910
of her pulling POTUS
into reactive positions

07:36.911 --> 07:39.546
that are bad for national security,

07:39.547 --> 07:41.415
not to mention his reelection prospects.

07:41.416 --> 07:45.386
'Cause you're less of
a liability than she is.

07:45.387 --> 07:47.488
And 'cause I don't like her.

07:47.489 --> 07:50.758
And that brings us to
Ellen Hill's replacement.

07:50.759 --> 07:53.360
I think General Reeves is our guy.

07:53.361 --> 07:57.431
Kelsey Reeves to chair the Joint Chiefs?

07:57.432 --> 08:00.501
I'd have to vet him.

08:00.502 --> 08:03.537
Trust me, he's clean.

08:03.538 --> 08:05.773
And he gets what we're trying to do.

08:05.774 --> 08:08.575
POTUS still values your counsel.

08:08.576 --> 08:10.744
A good word from you would go a long way.

08:10.745 --> 08:12.612
Well, I'll think about it.

08:14.181 --> 08:15.681
Don't piss me off, Craig.

08:18.095 --> 08:19.353
Why not?

08:19.354 --> 08:21.654
What are you gonna do?

08:22.090 --> 08:25.392
My job is to provide the
president an impartial opinion.

08:25.393 --> 08:27.995
If Reeves is the right candidate
for the job, I'll back him.

08:27.996 --> 08:31.397
If not... I won't.

08:35.269 --> 08:37.570
Thanks for the coffee.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:52.086 --> 08:55.289
I've been officially summoned to Moscow.

08:55.290 --> 08:58.225
My flight leaves this afternoon.

08:58.226 --> 09:00.493
We knew this was coming.

09:01.962 --> 09:03.297
I'm not ready.

09:03.298 --> 09:05.799
Do you remember how to
get to the secure phone?

09:05.800 --> 09:09.670
Men's room past security,
near carousel four.

09:09.671 --> 09:13.674
Toilet paper dispenser,
Second stall past the sinks.

09:13.675 --> 09:15.376
Dmitri.

09:15.377 --> 09:17.176
You're ready.

09:25.119 --> 09:28.088
There's a rumor that Maria
Ostrov might appoint Doroshevich

09:28.089 --> 09:30.591
as the next chief of the general staff.

09:30.592 --> 09:33.660
If that's true, you'll have access

09:33.661 --> 09:36.563
to the military planning
at the highest level.

09:36.564 --> 09:38.632
That's good news, Dmitri.

09:38.633 --> 09:41.234
That's what we planned.

09:47.074 --> 09:49.543
Dmitri, I know what you're
putting at risk here.

09:49.544 --> 09:51.945
And I promise I will do everything

09:51.946 --> 09:53.747
in my power to keep you safe.

09:53.748 --> 09:56.816
That's me talking, that
is not the U.S. government.

09:59.119 --> 10:01.288
I spoke to my sister Talia this morning.

10:01.289 --> 10:04.124
Her tumors are shrinking,

10:04.125 --> 10:06.527
but you probably knew that.

10:06.528 --> 10:08.395
I heard from the team in Stockholm.

10:08.396 --> 10:10.330
They're predicting a full remission.

10:10.331 --> 10:13.267
Yes.

10:13.268 --> 10:15.234
She is very happy.

10:16.837 --> 10:19.138
Thanks, professor.

10:20.541 --> 10:22.810
For everything.

10:22.811 --> 10:25.111
Good-bye.

10:28.749 --> 10:30.583
Do svidaniya.

10:43.263 --> 10:45.565
Up there.

10:52.844 --> 10:54.474
Sterling's not there yet.

10:55.078 --> 10:55.808
Why not?

10:55.810 --> 10:58.245
You can lead a horse to water...

11:01.715 --> 11:03.450
So now what?

11:03.451 --> 11:06.086
I think it's pretty
obvious... we give him a nudge.

11:06.087 --> 11:08.655
And when the moment comes...

11:08.656 --> 11:11.290
we gut him like a pig.

Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

11:28.267 --> 11:30.803
What kind of a nudge are we talking about?

11:30.804 --> 11:33.424
We can't exactly blackmail Sterling

11:33.425 --> 11:35.526
- to back Reeves.
- Unless Russell knows

11:35.527 --> 11:36.760
something I don't know.

11:36.761 --> 11:38.909
I vetted him myself. There are rumors,

11:38.910 --> 11:40.544
but nothing a reporter would care about.

11:40.545 --> 11:43.180
Which in Washington, makes Craig
Sterling a bona fide unicorn.

11:43.181 --> 11:44.176
A unicorn

11:44.177 --> 11:46.343
that has to endorse General
Reeves for Joint Chiefs.

11:46.344 --> 11:48.568
Until he does, my part
of the plan can't happen.

11:48.569 --> 11:50.403
The essential problem is Sterling

11:50.404 --> 11:52.805
- doesn't view you as a threat.
- Not yet, anyway.

11:52.806 --> 11:54.240
So where's the nudge?

11:54.241 --> 11:56.709
- I don't have it yet.
- Then what good are you?

11:56.710 --> 11:58.978
You're the one who brought
Judas to the White House.

11:58.979 --> 12:01.814
A lecture on loyalty from
the Dark Prince of K Street?

12:01.815 --> 12:03.516
I want this guy gone.

12:03.517 --> 12:05.718
Traitors are like serial
killers; they don't stop at one.

12:05.719 --> 12:08.387
Exactly. So let's tell Dalton.

12:08.388 --> 12:11.190
- That's not possible.
- Not if we want to win an election.

12:11.191 --> 12:13.192
If the Cuba thing leaks, it's a scandal.

12:13.193 --> 12:14.694
The president needs plausible deniability.

12:14.695 --> 12:16.028
No reporters asking him

12:16.029 --> 12:17.334
what he knew and when he knew it.

12:17.335 --> 12:18.639
Trust me, we've gamed it out.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.333
Sterling has to go of his own volition.

12:20.334 --> 12:21.834
That's the only way to eliminate him

12:21.835 --> 12:23.803
and protect the president at the same time.

12:23.804 --> 12:26.305
Well, frankly, that's not my
problem at a certain point.

12:26.306 --> 12:29.208
Tensions with Russia are escalating daily,

12:29.209 --> 12:31.944
and the longer Craig Sterling
stays in the situation room,

12:31.945 --> 12:33.546
the closer we get to war.

12:33.547 --> 12:35.114
If he doesn't resign,

12:35.115 --> 12:36.415
and fast,

12:36.416 --> 12:39.218
I'm going directly to the
president. Are we clear?

12:39.219 --> 12:41.953
Well, I'll look forward to
putting that on his schedule.

12:45.092 --> 12:47.392
Don't tell Carol.

12:48.261 --> 12:50.630
A wise man once said, "The stiffest tree

12:50.631 --> 12:52.964
is the most easily cracked."

12:54.267 --> 12:55.535
What is that, Sun Tzu?

12:55.536 --> 12:56.569
Actually, it's Bruce Lee.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.436
The point is, I've got the nudge.

12:59.305 --> 13:01.207
You want to take Sterling down?

13:01.208 --> 13:05.577
Let's see how far he'll
bend before he breaks.

13:13.819 --> 13:16.422
Guess who was in my office this morning.

13:16.423 --> 13:18.958
McCord's hatchet man.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.593
Mike Barnow?

13:20.594 --> 13:22.361
And his stupid dog.

13:22.362 --> 13:24.426
My assistant's allergic...
it caused a hell of a...

13:24.427 --> 13:25.965
What did he want?

13:25.966 --> 13:28.200
Copies of my official schedule

13:28.201 --> 13:31.904
from last week, when we were
meeting about the whole...

13:31.905 --> 13:33.272
Don't say it.

13:33.273 --> 13:35.840
Not here.

13:36.943 --> 13:39.478
I thought Russell Jackson
had her under control.

13:39.479 --> 13:42.148
He does. She's just
looking for a back door.

13:42.149 --> 13:43.916
You mean like going to the press?

13:43.917 --> 13:47.486
Maybe. But we have to
play this very carefully.

13:47.487 --> 13:50.256
What did you tell him? Barnow.

13:50.257 --> 13:53.526
That I was taking some personal
time for prayer and reflection.

13:53.527 --> 13:55.461
He didn't buy it.

13:55.462 --> 13:57.430
Well, he doesn't have to.

13:57.431 --> 13:59.966
Unless there's something to find?

13:59.967 --> 14:02.001
Of course not.

14:02.002 --> 14:03.970
Hey, I handled things at my end.

14:03.971 --> 14:05.870
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

14:06.439 --> 14:08.540
Thanks, Jamie.

14:09.976 --> 14:11.943
I mean it.

14:22.192 --> 14:23.321
_

14:51.328 --> 14:52.769
_

14:53.648 --> 14:55.011
_

14:55.735 --> 14:56.942
_

14:57.165 --> 14:58.507
_

15:05.498 --> 15:08.734
CIA capture team ready to breach.

15:11.837 --> 15:13.605
They're entering now.

15:25.117 --> 15:26.552
Clear!

15:26.553 --> 15:27.753
He's gone.

15:27.754 --> 15:29.989
What did we expect? We were too slow.

15:32.692 --> 15:35.895
Hang on. We got something here.

15:35.896 --> 15:37.662
It's a body.

15:39.265 --> 15:41.300
What the hell?

15:41.301 --> 15:42.568
Polonium.

15:42.569 --> 15:43.836
I've seen it before.

15:43.837 --> 15:46.605
Ephraim, do your guys have
a Geiger counter with them?

15:46.606 --> 15:48.207
Shelby, radiation check.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.375
Stand by.

15:50.811 --> 15:53.779
He's crapped up.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.181
He's hot.

15:55.182 --> 15:57.383
- Get them out of there.
- Bag and tag.

15:57.384 --> 15:58.951
Roger that.

15:58.952 --> 16:01.721
Polonium poisoning.
There's only one country

16:01.722 --> 16:03.823
that uses that method of assassination.

16:03.824 --> 16:05.323
Russia.

16:06.325 --> 16:08.828
They were obviously behind
the hack on Air Force One.

16:08.829 --> 16:11.330
Now they're covering their tracks.

16:11.331 --> 16:15.900
Mr. President, I think it's time
to consider retaliatory options.

16:16.869 --> 16:19.772
Elizabeth, do you think this is actionable?

16:19.773 --> 16:22.575
Polonium in and of itself isn't proof,

16:22.576 --> 16:24.810
but... if we get secondary confirmation

16:24.811 --> 16:26.812
from that tech, yes, sir.

16:26.813 --> 16:28.147
Evacuating now.

16:28.148 --> 16:30.249
I think we should retaliate.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.151
Good. General Kohl.

16:32.152 --> 16:33.552
I want strike options

16:33.553 --> 16:35.821
from CyberCom on my desk in 12 hours.

16:35.822 --> 16:37.323
Yes, Mr. President.

16:50.894 --> 16:53.263
- I'm going to the president.
- We're not there yet.

16:53.264 --> 16:54.531
You heard him.

16:54.532 --> 16:57.368
We are on the verge of
a cyber war with Russia.

16:57.369 --> 17:00.270
I... If that's where it goes, fine.

17:00.271 --> 17:02.873
But Craig Sterling is
just a little too excited

17:02.874 --> 17:05.376
- at the prospect for my taste.
- Mine, too.

17:05.377 --> 17:07.578
Well, then let's end it now.

17:07.579 --> 17:10.114
Let's expose the scheme
with Senator Parisi...

17:10.115 --> 17:11.815
And destroy Conrad's legacy.

17:11.816 --> 17:13.751
Is that really what you want?

17:13.752 --> 17:15.252
Come on, listen, listen.

17:15.252 --> 17:17.921
I once spent two days in a deer blind

17:17.922 --> 17:20.057
near Lake Wissota,
nothing but caffeine pills

17:20.058 --> 17:22.326
and squirrel jerky to keep me awake.

17:22.327 --> 17:24.560
I came home with a ten-point buck.

17:24.561 --> 17:25.796
You what?

17:25.797 --> 17:27.765
Some things are worth the wait.

17:27.766 --> 17:29.533
Not with Maria Ostrov on the throne.

17:29.534 --> 17:31.969
She's already amassing troops
on the Ukrainian border.

17:31.970 --> 17:33.103
Either we...

17:33.104 --> 17:35.139
What do you think about General Reeves?

17:35.140 --> 17:36.673
Craig Sterling just proposed him

17:36.674 --> 17:38.442
to replace Ellen Hill.

17:38.443 --> 17:41.245
Excellent. That's a...

17:41.246 --> 17:43.347
good choice, I'm thinking.

17:43.348 --> 17:44.281
Russell?

17:44.282 --> 17:46.283
I agree with the secretary on this one.

17:46.284 --> 17:48.485
- He's a fine candidate.
- Good.

17:48.486 --> 17:50.454
He was on my short list, too.

17:50.455 --> 17:52.790
Have OGC get into it.

17:52.791 --> 17:55.225
Yes, sir.

17:57.328 --> 17:59.463
See? Nudge worked.

17:59.464 --> 18:01.398
Now you're a threat.

18:01.399 --> 18:04.668
I'm gonna call Mike and tell
him to tee up the reporter.

18:04.669 --> 18:06.770
I would say I told you so,

18:06.771 --> 18:08.538
but you know I'm above that.

18:09.907 --> 18:12.709
Squirrel jerky. Really?

18:12.710 --> 18:14.678
Yeah.

18:14.679 --> 18:17.146
I wouldn't recommend it.

18:18.039 --> 18:19.446
_

18:22.152 --> 18:23.387
You hear anything?

18:23.388 --> 18:26.356
No. But Dmitri's now been MIA

18:26.357 --> 18:28.358
for more than eight hours.

18:28.359 --> 18:30.461
It's possible there's
an innocent explanation.

18:30.462 --> 18:32.496
Well, I admire your optimism, Professor.

18:32.497 --> 18:35.265
Look, Dmitri will lay low
until he sees an opening.

18:35.266 --> 18:36.667
That's how he was trained.

18:36.668 --> 18:38.502
I'm sure he'll recover the phone soon.

18:38.503 --> 18:39.636
Problem is, he can't.

18:39.637 --> 18:42.973
- Why's that?
- We had the phone removed.

18:42.974 --> 18:45.008
We couldn't risk it falling
into the wrong hands.

18:45.009 --> 18:47.244
How the hell is he supposed to contact us?

18:47.245 --> 18:49.746
There's a strong possibility
Dmitri's been exposed.

18:49.747 --> 18:52.649
- Or he defected.
- No. We can't make that assumption.

18:52.650 --> 18:54.718
Either way, we're in a holding pattern.

18:54.719 --> 18:56.153
What does that mean?

18:56.154 --> 18:57.754
We just sit on our hands?

18:57.755 --> 18:59.790
No. We have agents retracing his steps,

18:59.791 --> 19:01.725
hacking into his service records.

19:01.726 --> 19:05.661
But, Henry, the simplest
explanation is... we lost him.

19:07.197 --> 19:09.533
I refuse to believe that.

19:09.534 --> 19:12.134
Let me know when you have something.

19:16.106 --> 19:17.774
Harvest Glow

19:17.775 --> 19:20.110
melon extract... the natural rejuvenator.

19:20.111 --> 19:21.978
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:23.647 --> 19:25.082
...discover the natural...

19:25.083 --> 19:27.251
You think this stuff really works?

19:27.252 --> 19:29.887
- Not a chance.
- See, that's what I thought.

19:29.888 --> 19:33.290
But the melon doesn't age.

19:33.291 --> 19:34.391
It's weird.

19:34.392 --> 19:35.726
How much did you buy?

19:35.727 --> 19:36.793
I...

19:36.794 --> 19:39.228
Just... the sample pack.

19:40.731 --> 19:42.733
Two sample packs.

19:44.769 --> 19:46.136
So...

19:46.137 --> 19:47.905
you've had a lot of...

19:47.906 --> 19:49.540
extra work lately.

19:51.042 --> 19:53.577
Are there any actual TV shows on?

19:53.578 --> 19:55.879
Because God forbid we should talk?

20:00.217 --> 20:02.619
You have a bad day?

20:02.620 --> 20:05.389
Just your typical national security opera.

20:06.925 --> 20:08.358
Puccini or Strauss?

20:08.359 --> 20:10.794
What's the one where
they all die in the end?

20:12.897 --> 20:16.832
Well, if it's any consolation,
I had a rough day, too.

20:17.568 --> 20:19.435
I'm listening.

20:21.071 --> 20:23.005
You first.

20:26.310 --> 20:29.913
You know, I get we're
duty-and honor-bound,

20:29.914 --> 20:32.549
committed to lives of service and all that,

20:32.550 --> 20:35.152
but this part where we can't talk

20:35.153 --> 20:37.921
about the most important
things that we do all day,

20:37.922 --> 20:40.891
uh, that... cannot be healthy for us.

20:40.892 --> 20:44.460
The most important part of
my day is this, coming home.

20:46.063 --> 20:47.731
Oh, you're good.

20:47.732 --> 20:49.299
And your skin looks beautiful.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.802
- Pushing it.
- It's so smooth.

20:51.803 --> 20:53.770
Wait till you see it

20:53.771 --> 20:56.005
after a bucket of that stuff.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.476
Sorry I had to cancel on you the other day.

20:59.477 --> 21:02.279
- I wanted to make it up to you.
- Oh, no apologies necessary.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.748
- But go on.
- Uh, there's this vineyard in Mount Airy

21:04.749 --> 21:06.283
that's actually supposed to be pretty good.

21:06.284 --> 21:09.052
- I figured we would drive up there...
- Not bike?

21:09.053 --> 21:11.088
Yeah. Uh, no.

21:11.089 --> 21:12.889
I actually figured we'd Zipcar.

21:12.890 --> 21:15.759
Did you know the average car goes unused,

21:15.760 --> 21:17.394
like, 90% of the day?

21:17.395 --> 21:18.662
It's crazy inefficient.

21:18.663 --> 21:20.664
So kind of like an all-day thing?

21:20.665 --> 21:23.467
Yeah. We could... do a tasting,

21:23.468 --> 21:24.935
enjoy a picnic.

21:24.936 --> 21:26.870
I have cleared my schedule accordingly.

21:26.871 --> 21:29.039
Well, I got to check mine.

21:32.976 --> 21:35.512
Aw, Saturday's no good. I'm sorry.

21:35.513 --> 21:37.648
Oh, that's no problem.
What about next week?

21:39.717 --> 21:41.018
Pretty bad, too.

21:41.019 --> 21:42.819
How about if I call you?

21:42.820 --> 21:44.454
Uh, no, sure. Yeah.

21:44.455 --> 21:46.322
Absolutely.

21:47.224 --> 21:50.526
Well, I will... I will talk to you then.

21:52.696 --> 21:54.631
Are you blowing me off

21:54.632 --> 21:55.877
because you think I blew you off?

21:55.878 --> 21:57.334
Because, but for matters
of national security...

21:57.335 --> 22:01.271
I know. It was an unintentional,
classified blow-off.

22:01.272 --> 22:04.274
Got it. Uh, Nadine.

22:04.275 --> 22:05.442
Excuse me. I got to...

22:05.443 --> 22:08.744
Oh. Absolutely. Uh, peace.

22:09.446 --> 22:11.682
Peace?

22:11.683 --> 22:14.985
- Didn't mean that.
- This article

22:14.986 --> 22:17.287
is why God made expense accounts.

22:17.288 --> 22:21.157
I need an extension. Yes, another one.

22:22.659 --> 22:23.960
You... Oh. Crap.

22:23.961 --> 22:25.495
Let me call you back.

22:25.496 --> 22:27.464
Gordon, you remember Vanessa, don't you?

22:27.465 --> 22:29.199
Hi, Mike.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.500
I know what you're thinking.

22:30.501 --> 22:32.669
Is this a friendly hello,
or is it the other thing?

22:32.670 --> 22:34.571
Spoiler alert: it's the
other thing. You're due.

22:34.572 --> 22:36.206
Geez. Already?

22:36.207 --> 22:38.442
You owe me a favor, not a birthday card.

22:38.443 --> 22:39.843
You're due when I say it's due.

22:39.844 --> 22:42.312
Yeah, I was sort of hoping
you'd get hit by a bus first.

22:42.313 --> 22:43.714
Tough luck.

22:43.715 --> 22:45.215
Got a job for you.

22:45.216 --> 22:47.084
And what happens if I refuse?

22:47.085 --> 22:51.154
Nothing. Your dull, uninspiring
life will continue as ever.

22:51.155 --> 22:53.190
Oh. So there's incentive.

22:53.191 --> 22:57.794
Mmm. There's an opening in
Public Affairs at the Pentagon.

22:57.795 --> 23:00.297
Deputy Communications
Director to the SecDef.

23:00.298 --> 23:02.399
Just a hop, skip, and
a jump away from a gig

23:02.400 --> 23:03.834
on a major news network.

23:03.835 --> 23:06.603
What's the pay grade on that, GS-12?

23:06.604 --> 23:07.471
More like 14.

23:07.472 --> 23:08.838
Are you serious?

23:11.242 --> 23:12.608
Are you gonna throw that ball?

23:19.984 --> 23:21.651
There you go. See?

23:21.652 --> 23:23.452
It's easy.

23:25.622 --> 23:28.225
I have Vanessa Chung

23:28.226 --> 23:29.792
from The Chronicle on the line.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.464
You know they have
software for that, right?

23:34.465 --> 23:37.333
I'm old-school.

23:41.338 --> 23:42.439
Vanessa.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.774
How can I help you?

23:43.775 --> 23:45.742
Hi, Craig. It's been a while.

23:45.743 --> 23:49.579
I'm, uh, doing a profile on that
nominee for the Joint Chiefs,

23:49.580 --> 23:51.815
General Reeves. I
understand you endorsed him.

23:51.816 --> 23:52.949
That's right.

23:52.950 --> 23:54.785
Was there a quid pro quo on that?

23:54.786 --> 23:57.821
Because I have information that
he bribed you for your support.

23:57.822 --> 23:59.456
That's absolutely ridiculous.

23:59.457 --> 24:01.858
Can I quote you on that?

24:01.859 --> 24:04.828
No. Who the hell is your source?

24:04.829 --> 24:06.229
Mm, it's high-level, Craig.

24:06.230 --> 24:07.731
- You care to comment?
- No.

24:07.732 --> 24:10.934
And if you print any of
this, I'll sue your ass.

24:10.935 --> 24:14.337
- You hear me?
- Nice try. It's running tomorrow.

24:14.338 --> 24:18.675
When exactly did this
alleged bribery take place?

24:18.676 --> 24:22.444
Last Thursday, Dryden House in Georgetown.

24:25.048 --> 24:26.683
I wasn't even there.

24:26.684 --> 24:27.651
Do you have proof?

24:27.652 --> 24:29.152
What, for every minute of the day?

24:29.153 --> 24:31.453
Yeah.

24:32.155 --> 24:33.890
Craig.

24:33.891 --> 24:36.393
You there?

24:36.394 --> 24:38.027
Craig?

24:39.162 --> 24:41.731
You set me up.

24:41.732 --> 24:43.700
I beg your pardon?

24:43.701 --> 24:45.769
Reeves is dirty, isn't he?

24:45.770 --> 24:48.605
That's why you made me
endorse him before I was ready.

24:48.606 --> 24:51.875
That's why I am getting phone
calls from Vanessa Chung.

24:51.876 --> 24:52.943
From The Chronicle?

24:52.944 --> 24:54.377
She just accused me

24:54.378 --> 24:57.280
of meeting Reeves last
week and taking kickbacks.

24:57.281 --> 24:59.850
And you think I'm the source?

24:59.851 --> 25:02.519
This is funny to you?

25:02.520 --> 25:04.888
This is my career we're talking about.

25:04.889 --> 25:06.923
Take a breath. You really think

25:06.924 --> 25:08.758
I'm gonna expose the president to a scandal

25:08.759 --> 25:11.261
with an election coming
up? Come on. It's a bluff.

25:11.262 --> 25:15.397
How much you want to bet that
reporter is working for Mike B.?

25:20.071 --> 25:21.838
Just to screw me.

25:21.839 --> 25:25.609
Yeah, well, she'll regret it, believe me.

25:25.610 --> 25:27.310
What about the story?

25:27.311 --> 25:29.079
Just to screw me.

25:29.080 --> 25:32.849
Yeah, well, she'll regret it, believe me.

25:32.850 --> 25:35.785
What about the story?

25:35.786 --> 25:37.320
Give her an alibi.

25:37.321 --> 25:39.188
I can't.

25:40.090 --> 25:44.526
It involves a certain
senator from Illinois.

25:45.262 --> 25:48.197
Well, that's unfortunate.

25:49.799 --> 25:52.569
All right.

25:52.570 --> 25:54.037
I can kill the story.

25:54.038 --> 25:57.741
The editor and I go way back, but Chung...

25:57.742 --> 25:59.109
Chung is a bulldog.

25:59.110 --> 26:01.511
She's not gonna stop
until she has the truth.

26:01.512 --> 26:03.747
What do you want me to do?

26:03.748 --> 26:06.382
Handle it.

26:07.317 --> 26:11.034
How do I know you're
not playing me right now?

26:12.457 --> 26:14.090
Well, I gues you don't.

26:15.189 --> 26:18.549
But, if you want to save your skin
you don't really have a choice, do you?

26:37.693 --> 26:39.694
Dmitri's gone.

26:39.695 --> 26:41.562
What? What-what do you mean?

26:41.563 --> 26:44.999
I mean his file's been wiped
from the Russian system.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.267
It's like he doesn't exist.

26:46.268 --> 26:48.302
Damn it.

26:48.303 --> 26:52.306
Someone wanted him to disappear,
and it sure as hell wasn't us.

26:52.307 --> 26:55.376
That's why I'm pulling his support team

26:55.377 --> 26:56.510
from Moscow.

26:56.511 --> 26:57.845
Already? You can't do that.

26:57.846 --> 26:59.714
It's my operation. I'll
do whatever I need to.

26:59.715 --> 27:02.216
There are Russian troops
amassed on the Ukraine border.

27:02.217 --> 27:04.185
We need solid Intel,

27:04.186 --> 27:06.120
- now more than ever.
- Exactly.

27:06.121 --> 27:09.223
And I can't afford to keep
assets in place for a kid who,

27:09.224 --> 27:10.524
let's face it, is probably dead.

27:10.525 --> 27:12.059
What if you're wrong?

27:12.060 --> 27:13.761
You just want to write him off?

27:13.762 --> 27:15.930
No. But if it comes to it,

27:15.931 --> 27:17.998
that's exactly what we're gonna do.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.833
Or do we have a problem?

27:22.536 --> 27:24.003
No.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.808
It's so easy for you, isn't it?

27:27.809 --> 27:29.643
Hey.

27:29.644 --> 27:32.646
I learned the hard way,
don't make this personal.

27:32.647 --> 27:34.014
Okay.

27:34.015 --> 27:35.649
Dmitri is in a position

27:35.650 --> 27:38.486
to become the most highly
placed U.S. intelligence asset

27:38.487 --> 27:39.820
we've ever had in Russia.

27:39.821 --> 27:41.756
He deserves every chance we can give him.

27:41.757 --> 27:45.626
Just... Come on. A couple
of days to make contact.

27:45.627 --> 27:47.828
That's all I ask.

27:47.829 --> 27:50.498
You have 24 hours.

27:50.499 --> 27:53.366
If he doesn't make contact
by then, I'm shutting it down.

28:08.463 --> 28:09.984
I definitely spooked him.

28:09.985 --> 28:11.185
And the surveillance?

28:11.186 --> 28:12.286
Already in place.

28:12.287 --> 28:13.988
If he takes the bait, we'll be ready.

28:13.989 --> 28:16.557
Good. What about our hacker?

28:16.558 --> 28:18.359
Any word on the Russia connection?

28:18.360 --> 28:20.060
We're still going through his effects.

28:20.061 --> 28:22.696
It looks like he converted
20 million rubles, cash,

28:22.697 --> 28:24.432
into bitcoin over a week ago.

28:24.433 --> 28:26.066
Still not definitive.

28:26.067 --> 28:28.836
Not until we know exactly
where that money came from.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.571
I agree.

28:30.572 --> 28:33.240
We need decrypts on that laptop.

28:33.241 --> 28:34.508
Oliver Shaw is into it.

28:34.509 --> 28:36.744
All right. Let me know
when you have something.

28:36.745 --> 28:38.211
Yeah.

29:08.225 --> 29:11.970
_

29:13.011 --> 29:19.550
_

29:21.174 --> 29:22.974
_

29:24.506 --> 29:27.751
_

29:29.356 --> 29:32.383
_

29:54.690 --> 29:57.338
_

29:58.382 --> 29:59.734
_

30:14.165 --> 30:15.698
_

30:39.733 --> 30:41.000
Petrov.

30:42.150 --> 30:44.440
_

31:50.371 --> 31:51.837
_

31:53.644 --> 31:55.291
_

32:18.032 --> 32:21.334
Oh. Uh...

32:41.266 --> 32:42.339
_

32:43.485 --> 32:45.260
_

32:45.938 --> 32:46.854
_

32:58.038 --> 33:00.340
Uh, Mr. Goodwin?

33:00.341 --> 33:02.543
This is Arkady from the
Russian Fur Exchange.

33:02.544 --> 33:05.946
I'm sorry for the delay, but
I just joined a new sales team.

33:05.947 --> 33:07.548
Your custom order is ready,

33:07.549 --> 33:09.616
and it includes an additional bonus gift.

33:09.617 --> 33:11.351
We will be shipping

33:11.352 --> 33:13.721
in a half hour with full tracking.

33:13.722 --> 33:15.723
Thank you. Good-bye.

33:34.509 --> 33:37.444
Oh.

33:37.445 --> 33:39.012
Oh. Hey, what's up?

33:39.013 --> 33:41.582
Got a signal from Dmitri. He's okay.

33:41.583 --> 33:43.517
Well, are you sure?

33:43.518 --> 33:45.719
Yeah, he left a coded voicemail.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.555
And he's been transferred to the GRU.

33:48.556 --> 33:50.524
Okay, is he operational?

33:50.525 --> 33:52.292
Yes, and he has something.

33:52.293 --> 33:53.894
What is it?

33:53.895 --> 33:56.864
I don't know. He's on his
way to the dead drop now.

33:56.865 --> 33:58.499
Okay. ETA?

33:58.500 --> 34:00.000
30 minutes.

34:00.001 --> 34:02.102
Great. Thank you.

35:19.446 --> 35:21.281
- What's going on?
- Sir,

35:21.282 --> 35:23.115
you need to come with us.

35:28.355 --> 35:30.357
Thanks, Armando.

35:30.358 --> 35:33.961
Both of you.

35:33.962 --> 35:36.430
I should have known.

35:36.431 --> 35:39.900
Remember when I said you get a
pass for betraying the president

35:39.901 --> 35:42.102
in the middle of negotiations with Cuba?

35:42.103 --> 35:44.638
Well, I lied.

35:44.639 --> 35:48.609
And you're detaining me, why?

35:48.610 --> 35:50.277
Because you committed a crime.

35:50.278 --> 35:53.080
No, I had a conversation
with a senator from Illinois.

35:53.081 --> 35:54.381
Yes.

35:54.382 --> 35:56.817
But then again...

35:56.818 --> 35:58.752
there's this.

35:58.753 --> 36:01.622
That's the planner you shredded
in your office last night.

36:01.623 --> 36:03.056
Planner that contained

36:03.057 --> 36:05.359
evidence of your conspiracy
with Senator Parisi.

36:05.360 --> 36:07.995
"Contained" being the operative word.

36:07.996 --> 36:10.597
You can't prove anything.

36:10.598 --> 36:12.933
- Thing is, we don't have to.
- That planner

36:12.934 --> 36:15.936
also had notes of official
White House meetings.

36:15.937 --> 36:19.806
By destroying it, you violated
the Presidential Records Act

36:19.807 --> 36:21.341
of 1978.

36:21.342 --> 36:23.644
It's a little thing they
introduced after Watergate.

36:23.645 --> 36:25.612
Which, if I'm not mistaken, carries

36:25.613 --> 36:27.614
a prison term of up to three years.

36:27.615 --> 36:30.684
Probably more like 18 months
when all is said and done,

36:30.685 --> 36:32.653
but still.

36:32.654 --> 36:35.322
You can't do this.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.324
We just did.

36:37.325 --> 36:39.993
Way I see it,

36:39.994 --> 36:43.664
you can leave out the back
door with your dignity intact,

36:43.665 --> 36:46.967
or you can go out the front in handcuffs.

36:46.968 --> 36:48.968
It's really up to you.

36:54.708 --> 36:56.677
Son of a bitch.

36:56.678 --> 36:59.112
Not bad,

36:59.113 --> 37:01.148
as far as resignations go.

37:01.149 --> 37:04.717
He always was a plain-spoken man.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.623
Never should have trusted him.

37:09.624 --> 37:12.626
I would say "I told you so,"

37:12.627 --> 37:14.561
but you know I'm above that.

37:14.562 --> 37:16.396
Ha!

37:16.397 --> 37:18.899
Russell, this may be

37:18.900 --> 37:20.600
the most relaxed I've ever seen you.

37:20.601 --> 37:21.868
What can I say?

37:21.869 --> 37:24.204
Career assassination is good for my heart.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.607
Hello.

37:29.343 --> 37:31.345
I see.

37:31.346 --> 37:33.646
Right away.

37:37.651 --> 37:39.686
That was the Pentagon.

37:39.687 --> 37:42.489
They've decrypted Dash's laptop.

37:42.490 --> 37:44.958
We have secondary confirmation.

37:44.959 --> 37:47.060
It was Russia.

37:47.061 --> 37:49.361
They paid him.

37:57.394 --> 37:59.230
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.

37:59.231 --> 38:00.965
That makes two of us, sir.

38:00.966 --> 38:03.551
By the way... Craig's resignation.

38:03.552 --> 38:05.854
That was... sudden.

38:05.855 --> 38:08.122
Yes, Mr. President.

38:08.958 --> 38:11.093
General Reeves still on track?

38:11.094 --> 38:13.227
He'll breeze through the senate.

38:14.201 --> 38:15.264
My team at CyberCom

38:15.265 --> 38:17.900
has come up with three
possible retaliatory strikes

38:17.901 --> 38:19.335
against the Russian Federation,

38:19.336 --> 38:21.837
which we've designated Phases X, Y

38:21.838 --> 38:23.305
and Z.

38:23.306 --> 38:25.040
X is our least aggressive option.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.409
We target the Ostrov administration itself,

38:27.410 --> 38:31.347
initiating DNS attacks
against government Web sites.

38:31.348 --> 38:32.848
Phase Y:

38:32.849 --> 38:35.152
we expand that attack to
military infrastructure.

38:35.153 --> 38:36.935
Deactivate satellites

38:36.936 --> 38:38.737
and interrupt communications networks.

38:38.738 --> 38:40.307
That alone should give them

38:40.308 --> 38:42.907
serious thoughts about attacking
our interests in Ukraine.

38:42.908 --> 38:44.409
And Phase Z?

38:44.410 --> 38:46.678
The kitchen sink.

38:46.679 --> 38:50.982
We do all of the above, plus,
we hit the Moscow power grid.

38:50.983 --> 38:53.984
Give 'em a night they'll never forget.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.722
Oliver,

38:57.723 --> 39:01.126
how prepared are we to
withstand a counterattack?

39:01.127 --> 39:03.294
Sensitive networks have all been upgraded.

39:03.295 --> 39:05.330
We're as ready as can be.

39:05.331 --> 39:07.532
Good.

39:07.533 --> 39:10.067
Because I want to make the Kremlin go dark.

39:13.405 --> 39:15.707
Sir, I would strongly suggest

39:15.708 --> 39:17.809
that you consider Phase Y instead.

39:17.810 --> 39:19.144
Phase Y

39:19.145 --> 39:21.279
is proportional, sir.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.594
I'm aware of that.

39:22.595 --> 39:24.482
I'm not looking for a
proportional response.

39:24.483 --> 39:25.850
I want to send a message.

39:25.851 --> 39:27.252
Going after the military

39:27.253 --> 39:31.089
is one thing, but if we
publicly humiliate Maria Ostrov

39:31.090 --> 39:33.425
in front of 12 million
of her fellow countrymen,

39:33.426 --> 39:35.427
she'll have to retaliate.

39:35.428 --> 39:37.996
I think she'll crumble
after the first punch.

39:37.997 --> 39:41.900
Either way, it's time to
see what she's made of.

39:41.901 --> 39:44.869
Conrad, I think this is a mistake.

39:44.870 --> 39:48.073
You have eight hours to remove
our key personnel from Moscow.

39:48.074 --> 39:50.208
Meanwhile, summon the Russian ambassador.

39:50.209 --> 39:52.977
I want them to know
exactly what this was about.

39:52.978 --> 39:54.145
Sir.

39:54.146 --> 39:55.647
General Kohl, start the clock.

39:55.648 --> 39:57.314
Yes, Mr. President.

39:57.824 --> 39:59.250
You need to talk to him.

39:59.251 --> 40:00.819
There's nothing to discuss.

40:00.820 --> 40:02.216
Then look me in the eye and tell me

40:02.217 --> 40:04.351
that you're not afraid
of where this is going.

40:04.352 --> 40:06.872
Come on. We got rid of Sterling

40:06.873 --> 40:09.775
because we wanted to stop a
war. We can walk this back.

40:09.776 --> 40:11.410
I got rid of Sterling

40:11.411 --> 40:14.046
because he was sabotaging
the president's agenda.

40:14.047 --> 40:15.647
And right now, that agenda

40:15.648 --> 40:18.215
is sending the strongest
possible message to Moscow.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.055
When the president makes a decision,

40:23.056 --> 40:26.023
it's my duty to fall in line.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.226
I suggest you do the same.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.369
As you can see, Ostrov's
plans are much more aggressive

40:37.370 --> 40:39.104
than anyone at the Pentagon anticipated.

40:39.105 --> 40:42.274
She won't stop, not till
she has all of Ukraine

40:42.275 --> 40:43.508
under military occupation.

40:43.509 --> 40:45.477
Henry, this is a major intelligence coup.

40:45.478 --> 40:48.980
Yeah, thanks, but I'm not the
one putting my life on the line.

40:48.981 --> 40:52.317
We do owe a great deal to
your asset, that's true.

40:52.318 --> 40:54.219
Well, I'm glad you feel that way,

40:54.220 --> 40:56.388
because Dmitri left a handwritten note

40:56.389 --> 40:58.356
with the plans in his dead drop.

40:58.357 --> 41:00.257
Saying what?

41:02.494 --> 41:04.930
I hope he knows what that means.

41:04.931 --> 41:07.532
That we can't protect him?

41:07.533 --> 41:10.968
Oh, yeah. He knows.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.241
Where will he go?

41:16.242 --> 41:19.743
Best guess? He'll seek asylum
in Sweden with his sister.

41:21.374 --> 41:22.280
At the end of the day,

41:22.281 --> 41:24.915
she's pretty much all he's got.

42:07.759 --> 42:11.495
Madam Secretary, the Ambassador of Russia.

42:14.099 --> 42:16.101
Elizabeth.

42:16.102 --> 42:18.036
I hope this is quick.

42:18.037 --> 42:20.701
One of my girlfriends has
tickets for tonight's recital

42:20.702 --> 42:22.035
at the Kennedy Center.

42:22.036 --> 42:24.637
Oh, don't worry. It will be.

42:34.383 --> 42:37.884
Mr. Ambassador, you have been summoned here

42:37.885 --> 42:41.521
to answer for the illegal and
unconscionable cyber attack

42:41.522 --> 42:44.458
your country made on Air Force One.

42:44.459 --> 42:46.197
Air Force One was hacked?

42:46.198 --> 42:49.896
In a deliberate assault... by your country.

42:49.897 --> 42:52.312
I thought it was a solar flare.

42:52.313 --> 42:53.769
Don't play games with me.

42:53.770 --> 42:55.805
Please, Madam Secretary,
I'm merely trying to...

42:55.806 --> 42:57.873
Just listen.

42:57.874 --> 43:00.475
I have a message for your president.

43:02.211 --> 43:04.947
The United States maintains its right

43:04.948 --> 43:08.217
to retaliate when we deem it necessary.

43:08.218 --> 43:10.219
Tonight...

43:10.220 --> 43:13.088
we deem it necessary.

43:18.561 --> 43:20.529
When is this happening?

43:20.530 --> 43:23.032
Right now.

43:37.848 --> 43:45.568
