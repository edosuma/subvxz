they're not gonna think you're him.

what our real powers are.

introduced you to your parents.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.149
I'm going now, mate. See you on Friday.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.838
(KISSES)

41:41.880 --> 41:44.315
Hey, come on. Give over, you soft shite.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.556
Come here, come on, welcome home.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.432
(CHUCKLES)

41:53.440 --> 41:54.475
<i>So...</i>

41:54.520 --> 41:57.478
about that gay guy
that you hooked me up with.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.993
- Oh! Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

42:02.040 --> 42:04.316
I just wanted to say thanks.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.830
It felt good helping somebody.

42:07.880 --> 42:11.635
You know, I think this is what
I'm supposed to do with my power.

42:11.680 --> 42:15.116
You know, be like a... a proper hero.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.157
And all thanks to you, eh?

42:18.200 --> 42:20.510
Yeah, pleasure.

42:20.560 --> 42:23.439
So, hang on. Now you're into
helping people, would you?

42:23.480 --> 42:25.391
No. I won't shag your tortoise.

42:29.560 --> 42:32.871
Morning, Mark. Did you sleep well?

42:45.720 --> 42:47.916
(WHISPERS) See you later.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.917
- You all right?
- Mm.

43:00.920 --> 43:01.990
Oh!

43:03.720 --> 43:05.836
Is it weird that I miss him?

43:07.160 --> 43:09.515
It was nice having someone to look after.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.917
No, I don't think it's weird.

43:19.520 --> 43:22.592
Do you know what?
If I wasn't such a total fuck-up, I'd...

43:22.640 --> 43:25.234
I'd probably ask you out for a drink
and you'd say yeah

43:25.280 --> 43:28.875
because, well, I wouldn't be the mess
that stands before you now.

43:28.920 --> 43:32.879
I'd <i>be...</i> I'd be someone different,
you know, someone...

43:33.960 --> 43:35.633
...you know, someone good.

43:35.680 --> 43:40.516
And we'd end up having
this really amazing time together and...

43:40.560 --> 43:43.632
I dunno, we might even end up
as boyfriend and girlfriend.

43:43.680 --> 43:46.035
(CHUCKLES)

43:46.080 --> 43:50.074
And it wouldn't end up with me
just fucking it up all the time

43:50.120 --> 43:51.872
and you thinking I'm a total cunt.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.673
It wouldn't be like that at all.
It'd be nice.

43:57.080 --> 43:59.799
And we'd be happy... together

43:59.840 --> 44:03.674
and, I don't know, fucking hell, one day
we might even get a dog or something.

44:03.720 --> 44:05.438
(SHE CHUCKLES)

44:05.480 --> 44:06.675
Huh.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.233
All right, then.

44:15.880 --> 44:17.712
All right, then, what?

44:19.720 --> 44:22.792
You just asked me out for a drink
and I said yes.

44:27.680 --> 44:29.079
Yeah.

44:30.240 --> 44:31.958
Huh.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.316
Sam. Sam.

44:36.360 --> 44:38.158
I wanna show you something.

44:45.840 --> 44:47.990
Is that me?

44:48.040 --> 44:50.919
Yeah. I think so. Huh!

44:50.960 --> 44:53.554
And this girl down here
with the lightning bolts.

44:53.600 --> 44:56.479
I had an heart attack. She saved my life.

44:56.520 --> 44:58.830
Who's that on top of the building?

45:00.080 --> 45:03.436
- I don't know.
- Maybe it's you.

45:05.400 --> 45:08.836
What if we all become superheroes?
Huh!

45:09.920 --> 45:12.799
I mean like, you know, proper...

45:12.840 --> 45:14.239
superheroes.

45:18.680 --> 45:20.637
Maybe it's our destiny.

45:22.040 --> 45:24.554
<i>#...l saw you</i>

45:24.600 --> 45:29.276
# So cruelly you kissed me

45:29.320 --> 45:33.154
# Your lips a magic world

45:33.200 --> 45:36.989
# Your sky all hung with jewels

45:37.040 --> 45:41.079
# The killing moon

45:41.120 --> 45:45.478
# Will come too soon

45:45.520 --> 45:48.876
# Fate

45:48.920 --> 45:51.799
# Up against your will

45:53.520 --> 45:56.399
# You give yourself to him... #

46:12.200 --> 46:13.838
- (BEEP)
- I think it was my friend Lia.

46:13.880 --> 46:15.234
Lia?

46:15.280 --> 46:16.918
<i>I...</i> I think she did something to me.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.874
- What do you do?
- Probation worker.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.630
I... Oh, my God.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.876
Just don't talk to me. I'm... I'm a twat.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.310
I'm... I'm Lia.

46:30.360 --> 46:31.794
It was you, wasn't it?

46:33.760 --> 46:35.831
Can I just? Let me just say, in my...

46:35.880 --> 46:38.394
- let me just say in my defence...
- Aaah!

46:38.440 --> 46:41.398
JESS:It's her.
She's downloaded into Alex.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.669
Oh!

46:42.720 --> 46:44.154
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls!

46:48.000 --> 46:49.752
I think he's gone.
