00:33.967 --> 00:37.698
And a notch up from
the Wagner Char King Superiore...

00:37.804 --> 00:39.863
is the Char King lmperiale.

00:40.306 --> 00:44.072
Wagner's a fantastic company.
They're based right over in El Paso...

00:44.177 --> 00:47.874
so they've got American ingenuity
and Texas craftsmanship...

00:47.981 --> 00:49.414
-built right in--
-Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:49.516 --> 00:52.041
I bought an lmperiale here
eight years ago.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.416
And I think you were the guy
that sold it to me.

00:54.521 --> 00:55.545
Well...

00:55.655 --> 00:59.147
I've been preaching the word of Wagner
for the past 20 years.

00:59.259 --> 01:01.659
All the faces kind of blend together.

01:01.761 --> 01:05.754
Sug', sorry to bother you at work,
but I got a little propane crisis.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.298
I'll be right back.

01:08.001 --> 01:11.232
What do you need?
New tank, tank checked, tank wiped?

01:11.337 --> 01:14.500
I bought a hot tub, but right now
it's all tub and no hot.

01:14.607 --> 01:17.371
Can you rig up some
propane thingamajiggy?

01:17.477 --> 01:18.808
A hot tub?

01:19.479 --> 01:23.711
Well, you see, Nancy,
propane is a family gas.

01:23.850 --> 01:28.446
I've never approved of it being used
to promote alternative lifestyles.

01:28.555 --> 01:32.116
Oh, Hank, please.
It's my anniversary present to Dale.

01:32.225 --> 01:36.161
Couldn't you just send it on back
to California for servicing?

01:36.262 --> 01:40.790
I want to surprise him with it tonight.
It's our first anniversary since l....

01:41.701 --> 01:44.898
Well, you know, stopped cheating on him
with John Redcorn.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.370
I suppose I could take a look.

01:48.541 --> 01:51.169
Maybe I can adapt
the unit we use to heat the water...

01:51.277 --> 01:53.336
over at the pig-scalding plant.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.710
I mean, it is your anniversary.

01:56.816 --> 01:57.783
[Panting]

01:57.884 --> 01:59.852
I've got to tell you, Nancy...

01:59.953 --> 02:03.047
I've never done this before.
It's all so weird.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.716
The bonnet valves are bolted,
not screwed.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.157
The regulators are back-mounted.

02:09.529 --> 02:12.828
If l, if I could just...

02:12.932 --> 02:15.025
get it to work.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.566
Yes. Yes, I did it.

02:24.677 --> 02:28.238
Let me slip into the driver's seat
and give this baby a test run.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.543
What you're gonna wanna
go ahead and do...

02:30.650 --> 02:33.483
is submerge your entire self.

02:34.020 --> 02:38.081
That way you can accurately measure
the evenness of the heat.

02:39.859 --> 02:41.656
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.396
I am pudding.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.226
Hank, you're amazing.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.027
Oh, well.

02:48.134 --> 02:50.227
Yeah, you know.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.327
DALE: Damn it!
NANCY: Dale's home.

02:52.438 --> 02:53.564
Happy anniversary.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.437
Thank you for choosing
Strickland Propane.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.311
Happy anniversary, sug'.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.242
Wingo! A love tub!

03:04.317 --> 03:06.251
There goes your present.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.244
Believe me when I tell you...

03:09.355 --> 03:12.085
that was the wildest water heater repair...

03:12.192 --> 03:14.285
I've done in my entire life.

03:14.661 --> 03:19.223
Hank, you know what that
""can do"" attitude of yours does to me?

03:19.499 --> 03:21.228
It is Tuesday night.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.635
Sorry, Peggy. My mind's somewhere else.

03:24.737 --> 03:28.764
In a steaming tub
of propane-powered relaxation.

03:33.613 --> 03:36.548
Good idea, Hank. Save it up for tomorrow.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.981
We will be explosive.

03:54.767 --> 03:58.362
How do you like your burger?
Medium or medium-rare?

04:00.974 --> 04:03.909
-Medium, sug'.
-Okay, then.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.570
Oh, yeah.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.279
-You make a delicious burger, sug'.
-Thanks.

04:17.957 --> 04:20.187
But the Char King does most of the work.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.794
And, Bobby,
what would you like for breakfast?

04:29.902 --> 04:32.427
I don't care. Anything. No fruit!

04:33.139 --> 04:36.836
Here are your eggs, Hank.
I cannot legally call it a McMuffin.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.605
But you will never know the difference.

04:42.882 --> 04:45.783
You know, I had
the craziest dream last night.

04:45.885 --> 04:48.752
Oh, my God, me, too.
Who did you murder?

04:48.855 --> 04:52.188
Nobody. It was a good dream.
A great dream.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.261
Wish I could remember it.
It seemed really important.

04:55.395 --> 04:56.521
Dang, what was it?

04:57.964 --> 05:00.057
Wait, wait. I was grilling.

05:00.166 --> 05:04.000
-Yeah, I was grilling burgers.
-We've heard this one, Dad.

05:04.270 --> 05:07.671
No, it wasn't the giant burgers.
There was more.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.573
I was in the backyard
and I was feeling really good.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.575
Bobby, why don't you take
my breakfast egg sandwich...

05:17.684 --> 05:19.618
and eat it in your room?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.814
In case you change your mind.

05:23.790 --> 05:26.953
Peggy, you're not gonna believe this.
I was naked.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.827
[Laughing] I was grilling burgers naked.
How do you like that?

05:32.065 --> 05:34.898
And then, when the burger
was just right...

05:35.034 --> 05:38.401
I slid it on a kaiser roll and I fed it to....

05:39.906 --> 05:40.873
Uh....

05:41.140 --> 05:43.836
Fed it to me. Yeah, yeah.
And then what did I do?

05:44.644 --> 05:47.909
You ate it, and you said it tasted good.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.148
Oh.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.219
-Principal Moss.
-Huh?

05:54.320 --> 05:56.151
I murdered Principal Moss, Hank.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.314
But, then, instead of making me
the new principal...

05:58.424 --> 06:00.483
they appointed me
queen of the school district.

06:00.593 --> 06:02.458
I had an emerald crown.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.693
-Heya, John Redcorn.
-Hank.

06:12.238 --> 06:15.605
Yeah, John Redcorn,
I had a dream last night.

06:15.708 --> 06:19.303
-You got a minute?
-Come in. I'll brew some chamomile tea.

06:22.248 --> 06:23.215
[Sighing]

06:23.316 --> 06:27.582
...and the woman in my dream,
the one without the clothing...

06:27.687 --> 06:29.484
was not my wife.

06:29.589 --> 06:33.355
And, needless to say,
that is not a dream I intended to have.

06:33.926 --> 06:36.394
My people believe that dreams
are the unconscious mind...

06:36.496 --> 06:39.590
trying to solve a problem
that the conscious mind cannot.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.690
Is there anything unusual
going on with you?

06:41.801 --> 06:42.768
Nope.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.962
Everything's the same
as it's always been...

06:45.071 --> 06:47.266
for as long as I can remember.

06:47.373 --> 06:50.035
Yep. Same old, same old.

06:52.478 --> 06:53.445
[Sniffing]

06:54.447 --> 06:57.177
Is it possible that
after 20 years of marriage...

06:57.283 --> 07:00.480
-you're a little tired of your wife?
-What? That's crazy.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.885
Our romantic life is as good as
the day we were married.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.151
It hasn't changed a bit. Yep.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.250
We've got a great routine.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.159
If I were bored of Peggy,
I'd be having dreams...

07:12.265 --> 07:13.960
in which I was bored of Peggy...

07:14.066 --> 07:16.557
not grilling naked
with the neighbor's wife.

07:17.670 --> 07:18.898
Minh.

07:19.505 --> 07:20.529
No.

07:20.840 --> 07:21.966
It's Nancy?

07:22.542 --> 07:23.941
My Nancy?

07:24.310 --> 07:27.473
You're having dirty dreams
about my sweet Nan-Nan?

07:27.613 --> 07:29.706
Say, is that a new suede vest?

07:29.816 --> 07:32.785
Nancy used to like it
when I kept the vest on during sex.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.716
-Do you want it?
-Oh, God.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.914
Here, take it. Take it all.

07:46.566 --> 07:50.900
Hank, get on your swim trunks.
We are going hot-tubbing at the Gribbles.

07:51.370 --> 07:54.305
Oh, here, I have an extra nose clip for you.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.303
Oh. Hi, Nancy.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.311
I just wanted to thank you
for your help, sug'.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.473
-Dale loved the gift.
-Yeah.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.644
Yeah, that's nice...

08:05.751 --> 08:09.653
but I'm kind of not in the mood
for hot-tubbing tonight.

08:09.755 --> 08:11.154
Not in the mood?

08:11.257 --> 08:14.090
Hank, I cannot get out of it.
I already invited us.

08:14.193 --> 08:15.785
It would be rude.

08:17.396 --> 08:20.490
Sorry, sug's, but I don't know
where Dale went off to.

08:20.600 --> 08:24.468
He might be in the basement,
but I don't like going down there.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.331
Oh, hey, Nancy,
I see you've got some cheese there.

08:30.443 --> 08:34.345
It's just American Singles,
but I cut them into little squares.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.152
I hate to play the narrow urethra card...

08:46.259 --> 08:49.057
but I'm not gonna be able
to stay in here too long.

08:50.897 --> 08:54.128
Don't you think this is exactly
what Paris is like?

09:00.473 --> 09:02.168
Feel that heat.

09:03.342 --> 09:05.708
Yep, 102 degrees.

09:05.811 --> 09:08.302
I had a fever of 102 once.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.949
Took some aspirin, went right down.

09:11.183 --> 09:15.142
Speaking of hot,
Hank had quite a spicy dream last night.

09:15.254 --> 09:16.983
-Peggy!
-Oh, lighten up.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.580
We're hot-tubbing. Have some cheese.

09:19.825 --> 09:24.626
Hank dreamt that he and l
were grilling naked in the backyard.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.957
Isn't that the sexiest thing
you've ever heard?

09:28.935 --> 09:32.632
No one makes cheese like the Americans,
I tell you what.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.903
Nancy, get out of the tub!

09:37.543 --> 09:39.204
The electric toaster!

09:40.346 --> 09:42.007
What the hell are you doing?

09:42.114 --> 09:45.515
I know all about your naked dream
with my wife.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.645
-What?
-That's right.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.381
John Redcorn told me everything.

09:50.489 --> 09:53.549
He's a true friend, unlike you.

09:53.759 --> 09:54.726
Wait.

09:54.827 --> 09:58.354
You, me, and Nancy were naked?

09:58.464 --> 09:59.431
You?

09:59.532 --> 10:03.366
There wasn't room for you
in Hank's kinky little dream world.

10:03.469 --> 10:06.870
Are you sure it wasn't me
wearing a Nancy mask?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.008
I'm sorry.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.305
Hank, stay right there.

10:14.413 --> 10:16.973
I need to borrow your extension cord.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.750
Hank, I ask you this not as a jealous wife...

10:27.860 --> 10:32.354
but as a curious educator.
Are you attracted to Nancy?

10:32.465 --> 10:33.989
Absolutely not.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.763
You know I don't go for those sexy types.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.497
It was just the one dream...

10:39.605 --> 10:42.267
and the only reason
I didn't tell you the truth is because...

10:42.375 --> 10:46.175
you know, I'm not comfortable
talking about this kind of stuff.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.975
You told John Redcorn,
and you know he is a terrible gossip.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.844
You are 100%%  right about that.

10:52.952 --> 10:57.889
Telling John Redcorn was a mistake.
Now, why don't we put all this behind us?

10:58.557 --> 11:02.288
Maybe we can do
what I was too distracted to do last night.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.090
Sorry, Hank.

11:04.196 --> 11:06.994
Now you know what it feels like
to be kept waiting.

11:07.099 --> 11:10.000
Remember the six weeks
after Bobby was born?

11:10.136 --> 11:11.626
You bet you do.

11:12.238 --> 11:13.205
Ow.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.938
-Medium, right?
-Yes, please.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.517
Medium, it is.

11:31.557 --> 11:35.391
That hamburger exceeds
all USDA requirements.

11:36.295 --> 11:40.061
Hank, what is it?
Were you having another sex nightmare?

11:41.333 --> 11:43.824
No. No, I heard Ladybird whimpering.

11:43.936 --> 11:46.928
You know how that toilet water
goes right through her.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.633
Ladybird.

11:52.478 --> 11:56.175
Come on, girl, I stayed up with you
when you had nightmares.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.955
Oh, it's just one dream.
I wouldn't let it get to you.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.488
Oh, I yelled at Hank last night...

12:09.595 --> 12:12.962
and now he's been walking Ladybird
for six hours.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.056
Sug', just apologize.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.260
Oh, and Dale didn't want me
to say anything...

12:17.369 --> 12:20.634
but have Hank check under his lawnmower
before he starts it.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.744
Who's a good girl
and finally made for Daddy?

12:27.980 --> 12:31.040
Hank, I would like to apologize. So I will.

12:31.150 --> 12:34.950
Words were exchanged,
and I may have gotten the better of you.

12:35.054 --> 12:39.252
I am sorry.
One silly dream is not worth fighting over.

12:39.358 --> 12:42.521
Yep, it sure was silly. That one dream.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.624
Of course you're attracted to me.

12:45.731 --> 12:49.667
So to show you both my forgiveness
and my generosity...

12:49.769 --> 12:52.966
I think we should
go back to bed and make up.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.071
Okay, then.

12:58.944 --> 13:02.277
-That was real nice, Peggy.
-I knew it would be.

13:02.381 --> 13:05.475
-Hey, you want to split a beer?
-Just like our first time?

13:05.584 --> 13:07.779
You are so romantic.

13:13.759 --> 13:15.226
[Metal scraping outside]

13:15.327 --> 13:16.453
Hello?

13:18.564 --> 13:21.089
It's time to grill, sug'.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.428
-Nancy!
-Hank!

13:22.535 --> 13:25.470
-Peggy?
-That's right. Peggy!

13:25.571 --> 13:28.039
You fell asleep
while we were making sweet love...

13:28.140 --> 13:31.871
-and you dreamt about her? Again?
-Peggy, believe me...

13:31.977 --> 13:35.970
if I could go back in time
and stay awake during relations...

13:36.081 --> 13:38.242
-I would.
-But you can't.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.409
Because you are bored of me.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.987
No, no, no. I assure you...

13:43.088 --> 13:46.057
I could do the same old stuff
with you forever.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.127
You know how much I like
the fundamentals.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.923
I am not threatened by you!

13:53.032 --> 13:55.796
-Oh, sug'.
-Don't you ""sug'"" me.

13:55.901 --> 14:00.497
How could you try to steal my Hank?
Is there no end to your insecurity? Huh?

14:04.009 --> 14:07.137
Oh, Nancy, Hank had the dream again.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.840
-He's bored of me.
-Oh, sug'.

14:10.115 --> 14:11.309
Tell me, how do you and Dale...

14:11.417 --> 14:13.442
keep the sauce simmering
in your marriage?

14:13.552 --> 14:14.849
And do not say ""communicate""...

14:14.954 --> 14:17.479
because there are some things
Hank just will not do.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.614
I was lucky.

14:18.724 --> 14:21.056
Me and Dale took
a 14-year intimacy break...

14:21.160 --> 14:23.720
while I saw John Redcorn for migraines.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.990
So now it's back
like when we were first dating.

14:26.098 --> 14:29.158
Yeah, but I can't take a 14-year break.

14:29.301 --> 14:32.793
They'll have sex robots by then
and Hank won't need me.

14:32.938 --> 14:37.375
He's not bored of you, Peggy.
He's just bored of the things that you do.

14:37.476 --> 14:40.741
Have you thought about maybe
doing something a little kinky?

14:40.846 --> 14:41.813
Well, l....

14:41.947 --> 14:45.747
I guess I could wear my old high school
marching-band uniform.

14:45.985 --> 14:47.418
It's a start.

14:50.089 --> 14:52.284
Well, it's my old pal Hank...

14:52.391 --> 14:54.985
or should I say, ""You jerk""?

14:55.094 --> 14:56.254
-Dale--
-No!

14:56.562 --> 14:58.496
The time for talk is over.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.122
Prepare to be annihilated
by a lethal combination...

15:01.233 --> 15:04.600
of martial Tai Chi, Bagua, and Krav Maga.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.832
Now, grab my arm,
one hand on my wrist...

15:09.108 --> 15:10.905
and one hand on my elbow.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.478
And it's got to be right on the elbow
or it won't work.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.912
Trust me, getting your ass kicked
isn't gonna make you feel any better.

15:17.016 --> 15:18.779
One hand on my elbow!

15:18.884 --> 15:21.910
Now, let's just all settle down here.

15:22.021 --> 15:26.185
Which one of us hasn't had an innocent
sex dream about a friend's wife?

15:29.161 --> 15:30.128
You're right.

15:30.296 --> 15:34.164
Hank, you're my best friend.
I know you wouldn't bed my wife.

15:34.266 --> 15:38.202
Now, please take my hand
and my elbow in apology.

15:43.642 --> 15:44.939
[Metal scraping outside]

15:45.544 --> 15:46.670
Hello?

15:49.248 --> 15:51.341
Peggy, what are you doing?

15:51.450 --> 15:53.543
Making your dreams come true.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.210
Now, let's get naked.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.759
Peggy, what are you doing?

16:01.860 --> 16:05.523
You were naked,
and that was my second-best work shirt.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.598
Come on, Hank.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.395
Pick up those tongs
and take off those pants.

16:09.501 --> 16:12.436
I am not going to grill without clothes.

16:12.538 --> 16:15.564
Maybe without an apron,
that's as far as I'll go.

16:15.674 --> 16:19.007
You did it with Nancy,
but you won't do it with me?

16:19.111 --> 16:22.547
That was a dream,
and I didn't even want to do it then.

16:22.748 --> 16:25.273
Hold on a second.
I think I hear something in the bushes.

16:25.384 --> 16:29.753
-Hank, you are just stalling.
-I am not stalling. I am stopping.

16:29.955 --> 16:32.287
There's someone in that bush. Hey, you!

16:32.391 --> 16:36.384
It is your imagination which got us
into this mess in the first place.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.123
Do you want these dreams to end or not?

16:39.231 --> 16:40.198
[Someone burps]

16:41.200 --> 16:42.861
God dang it, Bill.

16:43.268 --> 16:44.633
I'm leaving.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.600
I am not exposing myself in public.
That's illegal.

16:49.775 --> 16:51.640
The press would have a field day.

16:51.744 --> 16:55.043
You know how they're always trying
to take propane down a notch.

16:55.147 --> 16:57.513
Fine. We will rent a skating rink...

16:57.850 --> 17:00.375
or wait, how about Paradise Cove?

17:00.486 --> 17:02.454
We can't go to a nude beach.

17:02.554 --> 17:05.352
I don't even like looking
at pictures of naked people.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.425
Then we will go at the break of dawn.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.654
-Can I at least think about it?
-Think about it?

17:10.829 --> 17:13.695
You have to think
about saving our marriage?

17:13.799 --> 17:14.766
[Sighing]

17:15.034 --> 17:16.126
Okay.

17:16.635 --> 17:19.297
-Can I wear oven mitts?
-Were they in the dream?

17:19.405 --> 17:20.895
-No.
-Then, no.

17:28.012 --> 17:31.312
Yeah, sure, at the 7-Eleven
you have to wear shoes and a shirt...

17:31.417 --> 17:34.648
but here in paradise,
""Hey, let's all get nude.""

17:36.155 --> 17:38.623
Are you sure this is the only way?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.555
I mean, couldn't we try...

17:41.894 --> 17:42.861
counseling?

17:42.961 --> 17:46.658
I did not know if your dream involved
Bermuda or Vidalia onions...

17:46.765 --> 17:48.392
so I brought both.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.428
Vidalia.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.428
Okay, I'm lighting the grill.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.440
Now the robe.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.768
My hand is on the sash.

18:00.546 --> 18:02.173
Pulling the sash.

18:02.781 --> 18:06.217
-My torso is exposed.
-Oh.

18:06.318 --> 18:08.878
Slow motion. So sexy.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.015
Now fast forward.

18:18.464 --> 18:22.400
So, this is what it's like
being naked outside.

18:24.470 --> 18:25.664
I don't like it.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.672
That is because
your fantasy is not complete.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.636
Here are the burgers.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.835
Well, let's cook them quick.

18:33.212 --> 18:38.013
Normally, I wouldn't press the burgers,
but these are extenuating circumstances.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.118
So, how do you feel?

18:42.921 --> 18:44.786
Hold on. I better turn these.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.755
They're searing well.
You know, I've got to say...

18:49.261 --> 18:51.092
this is pretty wild.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.464
I told you I smelled barbecue.

18:55.567 --> 18:56.761
Oh, God.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.498
Hamburgers at 7::00 a.m.?

19:00.839 --> 19:02.898
Someone's got the munchies.

19:03.242 --> 19:06.268
We are not hungry.
We are saving our marriage.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.537
Why are you here?

19:07.646 --> 19:10.012
We were over at the volleyball pit
and she's all, like...

19:10.115 --> 19:11.582
""Someone's grilling meat.""

19:11.683 --> 19:12.650
[Sniffing]

19:12.751 --> 19:16.209
Why does your barbecue smell
so much better than when we barbecue?

19:16.321 --> 19:18.983
Well, you're probably grilling
with charcoal...

19:19.091 --> 19:22.288
so chances are you're smelling the coals
or the lighter fluid.

19:22.394 --> 19:26.353
This is a propane grill,
so you're smelling the meat, not the heat.

19:26.465 --> 19:30.629
Sounds like you do a lot of grilling.
What's with the tan lines?

19:30.736 --> 19:32.829
Well, this is my first time here...

19:32.938 --> 19:35.930
but I've been in the grill game for 20 years.

19:36.575 --> 19:39.408
Hank Hill, Assistant Manager,
Strickland Propane.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.809
-Mandy.
-Becky.

19:41.914 --> 19:42.903
Peggy Hill.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.074
Hank, why don't we go
somewhere more private?

19:45.184 --> 19:48.847
You certainly can't live out your fantasy
with all these naked women around.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.785
Peggy, I'm kind of busy right now.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.119
This here's the Wagner Char King.

19:53.258 --> 19:56.921
Wagner's a fantastic company.
They're based out of El Paso...

19:57.029 --> 20:01.432
so you've got American ingenuity
and Texas craftsmanship built right in.

20:01.934 --> 20:05.062
At the age of six,
Charles Emerson Wagner...

20:05.170 --> 20:09.163
built his first grill out of chain-link fence
and an old washtub.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.305
-Later, dude.
-Bye, Mandy. Bye, Becky.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.138
Call me when you get back from Tucson.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.848
Your burger's ready. What....

20:17.950 --> 20:21.818
You wanted medium, right?
I could throw it back on.

20:21.920 --> 20:25.583
You don't want me anymore.
You want other women.

20:25.691 --> 20:29.525
-Younger, equally pretty women.
-Women?

20:29.628 --> 20:31.562
What, those customers?

20:31.663 --> 20:34.928
They're talking about converting
their houseboat to propane.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.364
Isn't that wild?

20:36.468 --> 20:41.064
We're talking heating, refrigeration,
dual outboard motors....

20:42.708 --> 20:44.005
Wait...

20:44.109 --> 20:46.771
are you turned on by the propane?

20:46.878 --> 20:50.006
You bet I am.
Think of all the things it can do.

20:50.115 --> 20:53.915
Nude grilling, hot tubs, hippie houseboats.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.543
Oh, my God.

20:55.654 --> 20:58.316
Those dreams
weren't about you and Nancy.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.914
They were about you and the grill.

21:01.026 --> 21:04.553
You weren't bored of me, Hank.
You were bored of propane.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.124
Of course.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.528
I'd fallen into a rut.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.529
Grills, tanks, grills, tanks.

21:11.637 --> 21:15.869
You see, I'd always thought of propane
as a dignified lady.

21:16.174 --> 21:21.009
But she's not just clean burning,
she can also be a dirty girl.

21:22.381 --> 21:24.713
That means I don't have to be.

21:24.816 --> 21:28.718
Now, what do you say we put on
some clothes, go home, take them off...

21:28.820 --> 21:32.051
and have a little
of the same old, same old?

21:32.157 --> 21:33.852
Oh, Hank.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.775
Mmm.

21:50.876 --> 21:51.843
Yeah.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.680
HANK: No oie makes cheese
like the Americais,
