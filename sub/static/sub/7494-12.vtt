WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:02.636
Narrator: Last time
on Make It Pop.

00:02.670 --> 00:04.172
The acting
auditions are over.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.273
We totally blew it.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.340
Father.

00:06.374 --> 00:07.708
If he finds out I'm in a
band, he'll send me home.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.710
I'm not doing the interview
without the star.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.712
DJ Maxwell: I had the
privilege of meeting

00:11.745 --> 00:12.846
a hot new up-and-
coming band...

00:12.880 --> 00:14.982
MacKendrick Prep's best
kept secret, XO IQ

00:15.015 --> 00:16.284
Yeahhh!!

00:16.317 --> 00:17.651
DJ Maxwell: Let's start with
the lovely and talented

00:17.685 --> 00:20.588
choreographer of the group
who tells me she hails from-

00:20.621 --> 00:25.126
Trust me, you won't want to miss
this fun band at Club Ry Ri.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.961
There's top notch talent
coming from MacKendrick Prep.

00:27.995 --> 00:30.098
Who knew!

00:30.598 --> 00:32.766
I believe this is
my cue to go nuts.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.405
Ahhhhhhh!

00:37.438 --> 00:39.006
Don't they get
excited in Brooklyn?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.007
They do.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.042
But it's more
like this...

00:42.610 --> 00:46.914
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:47.815 --> 00:48.516
Corki.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.883
Earth to Corki.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.485
I think Corki
missed the memo.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.054
Corki, you're the only
soon-to-be-pop star I know who

00:54.088 --> 00:57.458
isn't excited to hear
her concert promoted by

00:57.491 --> 01:00.461
one of the top music
podcasts in the world.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.629
Give her a second.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.598
Her "calm to bananas" ratio
is much higher than yours.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.835
It's my dad,fame is the last
thing he'd want for me.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.804
Aw, don't worry, Corki.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.040
I can be famous
enough for both of us.

01:13.241 --> 01:18.979
*

01:19.012 --> 01:21.849
Everyone's talking
about our show tonight!

01:21.882 --> 01:23.151
This is too
much attention.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.487
There's no such thing as
too much attention, Corki.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.489
You're under a lot
of stress right now,

01:28.522 --> 01:31.159
so I'm going to pretend
you didn't say that.

01:31.192 --> 01:36.797
Sun Hi, can you
autograph my binder?

01:36.830 --> 01:39.099
And my pencil case?

01:39.133 --> 01:40.601
And my yogurt?

01:40.634 --> 01:43.737
Okay, that's too
much attention.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.539
You said your dad
loves you performing.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.942
But being in a pop band is
not what he wants me to be.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.744
What does he
want you to be?

01:50.778 --> 01:52.146
The successor to
his business empire.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.947
Unless his empire is
piÃ±atas and waterslides,

01:53.981 --> 01:55.048
that sounds
less than fun.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.951
If I don't impress him,
I'll be sent back to China.

01:57.985 --> 02:00.788
I have to get to class.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.158
Hey!

02:04.192 --> 02:06.093
I've been working on my designs
for The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

02:06.126 --> 02:06.694
Oh goody.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.128
Lemme see!

02:08.162 --> 02:10.164
Wow, these are so...

02:10.198 --> 02:13.100
wild.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.003
Even wilder!

02:16.570 --> 02:18.172
No way!

02:18.206 --> 02:20.574
The best designer in the
world, Hye Jung Ko,

02:20.608 --> 02:22.843
has a pop-up
store today!

02:22.876 --> 02:26.580
No way I'm missing that.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.850
We have a show
tonight, remember?

02:30.584 --> 02:32.586
One of my band members
is going shopping,

02:32.620 --> 02:35.022
and the other
refuses to perform.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.724
This group
depresses me.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.992
Are you sure you don't wanna
autograph my yogurt?

02:39.026 --> 02:39.927
It's fruit bottom.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.162
Okay, what the heck.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.969
* Make it pop, woo, woo

02:49.002 --> 02:52.873
* Make it pop, woo, woo

02:52.906 --> 02:56.210
* I can't wait no
I can't wait no *

02:56.244 --> 02:59.012
* I can't wait no
I can't wait *

02:59.046 --> 03:02.683
* So make it pop, we're bout
to, we're bout to blow *

03:02.716 --> 03:05.919
* Wait till we drop,
Oh ya, we're ready to go *

03:05.953 --> 03:09.089
* Ain't gonna stop, when
is it time for the show *

03:09.122 --> 03:11.925
* We make it, you
make it, they make it *

03:11.959 --> 03:15.296
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

03:16.830 --> 03:18.799
Miss Hurley: Split
infinitives, when a word

03:18.832 --> 03:20.301
splits two halves
of a verb.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.271
For example: "These students
blatantly ignore me."

03:23.304 --> 03:27.174
"I absolutely should have
chosen another profession."

03:28.276 --> 03:31.612
Guys, you totally have to be
there for tonight performance.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.282
You just split
an infinitive.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.718
Can you please stop
learning for one second?

03:37.751 --> 03:40.954
Seeing Hye Jung Ko is a
once-in-a lifetime opportunity.

03:40.988 --> 03:45.225
But I'll be back in plenty
of time for our show.

03:45.259 --> 03:48.596
I still don't see how I can
perform with my father here.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.697
How would he know?

03:49.730 --> 03:53.667
It's not like he's there
every time you turn around.

03:53.701 --> 03:59.640
Oh boy.

03:59.673 --> 04:00.341
Hello, Corki.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.209
Everyone, act normal.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.379
Pay no attention to having a
famous billionaire in our midst.

04:05.413 --> 04:08.382
And don't dwell on the fact that
your every action could directly

04:08.416 --> 04:10.984
impact our ability
to get funding.

04:11.018 --> 04:14.722
I'm just auditing
my daughter's classes.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.923
Pretend I'm not
even here.

04:15.956 --> 04:16.790
You heard the man.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.926
Pretend he's not
here, and do the show.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.693
Problem solved!

04:21.128 --> 04:22.830
Mr. Stark: Next!

04:22.863 --> 04:23.864
Oh no!

04:23.897 --> 04:24.798
I'm trapped!

04:24.832 --> 04:25.899
Mr. Stark: Save me!

04:25.933 --> 04:27.234
Look - a way out!

04:27.267 --> 04:29.637
* A, B, C, D, E, F, G

04:29.670 --> 04:32.072
Mr. Stark: Seriously?

04:32.105 --> 04:35.776
H, I, J, K, L, M,
N, O, P

04:35.809 --> 04:37.277
Mr. Stark?

04:37.311 --> 04:37.845
Mr. Anderson.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.380
What can I do for you?

04:39.413 --> 04:40.981
I brought you a
blueberry muffin

04:41.014 --> 04:43.684
and a soy latte, extra
hot, double foam.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.786
I remembered you once mentioned
being lactose intolerant.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.520
I am.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.722
But I like my
latte no foam.

04:48.756 --> 04:53.994
Gotcha.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.764
Owweeeee it's
hot foam.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.798
Are those the auditions?

04:57.831 --> 04:58.732
How do they look?

04:58.766 --> 05:01.869
Every child has his or
her own... gifts.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.303
So you haven't
made a decision?

05:03.337 --> 05:06.807
Well, if you're still looking
for a lead, I know a guy.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.441
It's me.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.209
The guy is me.

05:09.242 --> 05:12.746
Please don't talk
with your mouth full.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.948
Especially if you
were going to say no.

05:14.982 --> 05:27.260
*

05:27.294 --> 05:28.061
Ohhhh.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.330
Nice top.

05:30.364 --> 05:34.468
Ouhh, amazing dress.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.937
Oh, I'm not a--

05:36.970 --> 05:40.140
But, you think
I'm a...

05:40.173 --> 05:42.376
Yes, I am a model.

05:42.410 --> 05:46.847
A model that wears Hye
Jung Ko's original designs.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.949
Awesome jacket.

05:51.284 --> 05:55.423
If only I could be a
part of this world...

05:55.456 --> 06:05.466
*

06:05.499 --> 06:11.004
*

06:11.038 --> 06:16.309
* So, this is how it tastes,
every color of the rainbow *

06:16.343 --> 06:18.378
* Are magic in my show

06:18.412 --> 06:23.484
* So, this is how it feels,
to get everyone talking *

06:23.517 --> 06:25.886
* The Big reveal

06:25.919 --> 06:31.224
* Woo oo ooo, It's a
crazy situation *

06:31.258 --> 06:33.226
* Look at my creations

06:33.260 --> 06:36.396
* Woo oo oo

06:36.430 --> 06:38.532
* Absolute fascination

06:38.566 --> 06:40.468
* A runway sensation

06:40.501 --> 06:45.405
* Now I am here
where I'm meant to be *

06:45.439 --> 06:47.908
* I'm meant to be e e

06:47.941 --> 06:52.980
* Show of the year,
A new Style Queen *

06:53.013 --> 06:55.182
* Boom Boom on
the scene *

06:55.215 --> 07:03.991
* Now I am here where I'm
meant to be, I'm meant to be *

07:04.024 --> 07:07.795
* Show of the year,
A new Style Queen *

07:07.828 --> 07:17.404
* Boom Boom on
the scene *

07:17.437 --> 07:20.474
* So this is it
my friends *

07:20.508 --> 07:22.342
* The hottest
ticket in town *

07:22.375 --> 07:24.812
* Everyone will attend

07:24.845 --> 07:28.248
* Oh, this is where it goes

07:28.281 --> 07:30.050
* In all the magazines

07:30.083 --> 07:32.185
* And everyone knows

07:32.219 --> 07:39.459
* Now I am here where I'm meant
to be I'm meant to be e e *

07:39.493 --> 07:44.565
* Show of the year,
A new Style Queen *

07:44.598 --> 07:47.000
* Boom Boom on the scene

07:47.034 --> 07:54.374
* Now I am here where I'm
meant to be, I'm meant to be *

07:54.407 --> 07:59.379
* Show of the year,
A new Style Queen *

07:59.412 --> 08:02.583
* Boom Boom on
the scene *

08:02.616 --> 08:04.384
I could be part
of this world,

08:04.417 --> 08:08.822
I just need to
go for it.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.128
And your blood
pressure is...

08:15.162 --> 08:17.430
six hundred over
one-ninety-five.

08:17.464 --> 08:18.298
That's impossible.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.301
I'd be dead.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.605
Then I guess you're lucky I
don't know what I'm doing.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.238
Here.

08:25.272 --> 08:28.275
Let me try.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.910
Why the safety
goggles, Sun Hi?

08:29.943 --> 08:32.179
I've had an accident or
two in this classroom.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.881
You can never
be too careful.

08:33.914 --> 08:37.017
Corki, on the other hand,
is a natural in the lab.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.452
Ooh, that's a bit tight.

08:39.486 --> 08:43.023
Anyway, I think Corki
deserves some time off.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.292
Like tonight, say.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.327
With her friends.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.361
And only her friends.

08:48.395 --> 08:48.929
Corki?

08:48.962 --> 08:50.097
I can't feel my hand.

08:50.130 --> 08:50.598
Corki?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.432
(bang)

08:52.465 --> 08:53.433
See what I mean?

08:53.466 --> 08:54.201
Goggles.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.502
Smart.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.271
Corki, is
something wrong?

08:58.305 --> 09:01.408
Yeah, it's usually my
job to mess this stuff up.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.676
No, I'm fine.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.211
Between studying,
violin,

09:04.244 --> 09:06.046
and memorizing Pi
to three hundred digits,

09:06.079 --> 09:08.548
I still managed eight
hours of sleep.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.918
And that's the kind of
frighteningly healthy

09:10.951 --> 09:13.220
work ethic we instill
here, Mr. Chang.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.023
Perhaps you would
find that worthy of

09:16.056 --> 09:18.592
another generous
donation.

09:18.626 --> 09:19.993
Am I being too much?

09:20.027 --> 09:22.462
I'm being too much.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.563
Sun Hi is right.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.966
That's the first
time anyone's ever

09:25.999 --> 09:27.234
said that in
this classroom.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.070
You're working very hard, Corki,
and you deserve some time off.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.271
Yes!

09:31.304 --> 09:33.607
So I will take you girls out.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.542
We can spend some
quality time together.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.610
Does that mean shopping?

09:36.644 --> 09:38.111
Somewhere expensive?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.980
I was thinking dinner.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.148
Tonight.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.483
Tonight...

09:43.516 --> 09:45.152
Of course.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.554
Because we had
nothing else to do.

09:47.587 --> 09:53.160
Good.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.295
Not a good day
for blood pressure.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.434
My plan is to impress Hye
Jung with my sketches,

10:01.468 --> 10:03.637
do a show together,
then get my own line

10:03.671 --> 10:07.407
and take the fashion
world by storm.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.441
Oh, my gosh...

10:08.475 --> 10:10.377
is that...?

10:10.410 --> 10:11.979
It's Hye Jung Ko.

10:12.012 --> 10:12.579
This is it.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.483
My big chance!

10:16.516 --> 10:18.118
It's really you...

10:18.151 --> 10:19.186
Hye Jung...

10:19.219 --> 10:25.558
I... you...
me... wow.

10:25.592 --> 10:30.030
Like you would have
handled that any better.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.232
We have our next pop-up
location, so that's it!

10:32.265 --> 10:33.767
Wrap it up!

10:33.801 --> 10:34.567
Ugh.

10:34.601 --> 10:35.635
Agh.

10:35.669 --> 10:36.837
Ms. Ko...

10:36.870 --> 10:40.073
I'm really inspired and I think
you're an amazing designer

10:40.107 --> 10:41.374
and I just really...

10:41.408 --> 10:42.242
Ahh!

10:42.275 --> 10:44.077
Wardrobe malfunction...

10:44.111 --> 10:45.645
Agh, a little help?

10:45.679 --> 10:49.616
Whooo nice dress!

10:51.719 --> 10:53.120
A little help here?

10:53.153 --> 10:59.159
Help, um hello?

10:59.192 --> 11:00.527
Hello?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.630
(phone ringing)

11:03.663 --> 11:05.298
It's Jodi!

11:05.332 --> 11:06.566
Hello?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.201
Thank goodness I got you!

11:08.235 --> 11:10.370
I'm stuck in Hye
Jung's pop-up store.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.538
The connection's terrible.

11:11.571 --> 11:12.806
Hang up and call back.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.874
No!

11:13.907 --> 11:16.676
The store is in a truck,
and I'm stuck in the back.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.311
What? Where?

11:18.345 --> 11:19.146
I don't know!

11:19.179 --> 11:20.647
The truck's moving.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.116
How am I supposed to
achieve worldwide stardom

11:23.150 --> 11:25.452
with you stuck
in a truck?

11:25.485 --> 11:28.088
Your concern for my
safety is heartwarming.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.758
Whoo.

11:30.791 --> 11:31.992
Ahhh!

11:32.025 --> 11:35.428
I can track Jodi's location
using the signal from her phone.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.196
What!

11:36.229 --> 11:37.364
Really?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.733
My father owns the patent
on a cell phone locator app.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.301
Handy.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.703
The podcast
interview paid off!

11:43.737 --> 11:45.338
Our search hits
have tripled!

11:45.372 --> 11:46.173
What?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.107
No!

11:47.140 --> 11:49.076
Not exactly the
reaction I was expecting.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.477
Corki's stressed.

11:50.510 --> 11:54.181
Hey, Why don't you just
come to Club Ry Ri,

11:54.214 --> 11:56.183
do a couple numbers
with the band,

11:56.216 --> 11:58.118
then meet up with
your dad later.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.719
He never needs
to know.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.521
That way you can
have it all.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.123
And so can I.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.724
Yay me!

12:04.758 --> 12:05.325
C'mon.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.326
Let's go.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.228
Caleb, can you keep my
father busy for awhile?

12:08.261 --> 12:10.197
I'm not good with
talking to adults.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.800
Or... anyone, really.

12:12.833 --> 12:13.533
You have to.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.168
Corki's got the
whatchamacallit

12:15.202 --> 12:17.670
to track Jodi so
we can rescue her.

12:17.704 --> 12:18.671
Where's Jodi?

12:18.705 --> 12:21.274
Locked in a truck headed
for I don't know where.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.642
It's a long story.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.378
Come on, Corki.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.246
Father!

12:26.279 --> 12:27.848
I'm ready for your
next class, Corki.

12:27.881 --> 12:28.816
Um...

12:28.849 --> 12:30.350
You can't come.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.885
Why not?

12:31.919 --> 12:36.623
Yeah, why not,
Sun Hi?

12:36.656 --> 12:39.259
Because it's Phys Ed.

12:39.292 --> 12:43.396
No boys allowed.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.700
So, Mr. Chang.

12:47.734 --> 12:50.270
I hear you're
a billionaire.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.206
How's that working
out for you?

12:53.673 --> 12:55.242
Ahh!

12:55.275 --> 12:56.043
Mr. Stark!

12:56.076 --> 12:57.377
Have you finalized
the cast yet?

12:57.410 --> 12:58.211
No.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.147
In fact, I may have
underestimated

13:00.180 --> 13:02.883
the scope of this show.

13:02.916 --> 13:06.887
I don't have enough actresses
for all of the female roles.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.422
Well, you know Dennis
and his little dog Toto

13:09.456 --> 13:11.458
don't sound so bad
now, do they?

13:14.427 --> 13:16.229
This way!

13:16.263 --> 13:19.532
It's like we're in
a spy movie!

13:19.566 --> 13:23.303
Over there!

13:23.336 --> 13:24.571
Jodi, are you in there?

13:24.604 --> 13:25.772
Jodi: Yes!

13:25.805 --> 13:27.540
I've been yelling for
help for over an hour!

13:27.574 --> 13:30.377
In between trying on
outfits of course.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.244
Don't worry!

13:31.278 --> 13:32.545
We'll get you out!

13:32.579 --> 13:33.613
Get her out!

13:33.646 --> 13:36.583
I have a cargo lock
deactivator app on my phone.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.817
Of course you do.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.419
My father's security
tech division --

13:39.452 --> 13:41.221
-- owns a
patent, I get it.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.323
Is there anything your
father doesn't own?

13:43.356 --> 13:45.926
This truck, apparently.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.627
Oh, wait.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.730
He owns this, too.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.475
Thanks.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.578
I saw Hye Jung Ko and tried to
talk to her but totally blew it.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.647
What a day.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.548
Are you kidding?

14:08.581 --> 14:09.382
You're alive!

14:09.416 --> 14:10.918
And looking fabulous,
I might add.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.719
You should've seen
outfits one through twelve.

14:12.752 --> 14:15.688
I've got some great new
ideas for our bands look.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.524
Band photo op!

14:18.858 --> 14:21.394
Come on, lets go.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.005
I think I should
be going.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.006
Uh, no.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.709
Really??

14:36.743 --> 14:40.914
Oh, it's almost time
for the concert--

14:40.948 --> 14:44.017
--ed effort I must
put into my job.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.953
That seemed like
you said "concert,"

14:45.986 --> 14:49.522
then awkwardly covered by
changing it to "concerted."

14:53.760 --> 14:57.630
No, really?

14:57.664 --> 14:58.498
Oh.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.332
Mr. Chang.

14:59.366 --> 15:02.269
I'm so sorry.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.637
Everything all
right, Mr. Stark?

15:04.671 --> 15:06.906
Just in the middle of
casting the school play.

15:06.940 --> 15:07.774
But I'm fine.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.709
If anyone asks,
especially Ms. Diona,

15:09.742 --> 15:13.513
just tell them
it's fine.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.448
You seem... distressed.

15:15.482 --> 15:19.452
Well, my casting
pool is quite shallow.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.488
More of a puddle really.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.791
I'm thinking of taking Corki to
this show, it looks good.

15:24.824 --> 15:28.061
"Top notch talent
from MacKendrick Prep!?"

15:28.095 --> 15:31.931
Why didn't they
audition for my musical?

15:31.965 --> 15:35.435
I'll tag along and give
them a piece of my mind!

15:35.702 --> 15:41.808
*

15:41.841 --> 15:45.845
Come on we gotta
get changed quick!

15:45.878 --> 15:49.316
Caleb: Give it
up for XO IQ.

15:55.688 --> 15:59.492
* I can't wait for
the weekend *

15:59.526 --> 16:03.330
* Hanging out with
my girlfriends *

16:03.363 --> 16:10.737
* Doing things that we
wanna do, oooh. *

16:10.770 --> 16:14.341
* Make-up on, pick
the right dress *

16:14.374 --> 16:18.345
* Do our hair like
supermodels *

16:18.378 --> 16:24.851
* Have some fun and just
forget 'bout school, no rules *

16:24.884 --> 16:31.991
* Get the party started
You know what to do *

16:32.025 --> 16:35.628
* Everyone's invited

16:35.662 --> 16:40.733
* You can come too, yes
you can come too (oooh) *

16:40.767 --> 16:43.936
* Friday night it feels
alright, let's do it again *

16:43.970 --> 16:47.807
* Friday night it feels
alright, let's do it again *

16:47.840 --> 16:51.411
* Friday night it feels
alright, let's do it again *

16:51.444 --> 16:56.816
* Let's do it again -
do, do it again *

16:59.519 --> 17:03.022
* Flashing lights
shine at our show *

17:03.056 --> 17:06.859
* People moving
on the dance-floor *

17:06.893 --> 17:14.501
* Music takes you where
you wanna go, oh oh *

17:14.534 --> 17:18.171
* Don't stop dancing
can you feel it *

17:18.205 --> 17:22.008
* The beat is pumping
gotta use it *

17:22.041 --> 17:28.881
* It's now or never
everyone come on, come on *

17:28.915 --> 17:31.851
* Get the party started

17:31.884 --> 17:39.192
* You know what to do
Everyone's invited *

17:39.226 --> 17:43.963
* You can come too, know
you want to (oooh) *

17:43.996 --> 17:47.667
* Friday night it feels
alright, let's do it again *

17:47.700 --> 17:51.538
* Friday night it feels
alright, let's do it again *

17:51.571 --> 17:54.974
* Friday night it feels
alright, let's do it again *

17:55.007 --> 17:59.979
* Let's do it again
do, do it again *

18:00.012 --> 18:05.785
(cheering)

18:05.818 --> 18:08.821
That blows all those other
auditions out of the water.

18:08.855 --> 18:15.027
I mean wow, seriously wow.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.571
My father saw
the whole thing!

18:24.604 --> 18:25.972
What do you
think he'll do?

18:26.005 --> 18:27.640
Probably send me home.

18:27.674 --> 18:34.914
I guess this is goodbye.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.785
Sun Hi, maybe we should
go check on our hair.

18:38.818 --> 18:39.786
What do you mean?

18:39.819 --> 18:42.722
My hair is perfect.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.024
Ohhhhh.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.759
Well, we should
fix your hair.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.961
That could use
some fixing for sure.

18:54.834 --> 18:55.935
Father, let me explain.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.770
I never meant
to lie to you.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.006
And I know this must be very
disappointing, but--

19:00.039 --> 19:03.943
That was wonderful.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.111
Excuse me?

19:05.144 --> 19:05.912
I loved it.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.080
So catchy.

19:08.114 --> 19:13.820
* Friday night it feels
alright, let's do it again *

19:13.853 --> 19:15.021
You liked it?

19:15.054 --> 19:16.088
Yes.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.924
Yes, I did.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.927
Your mother had a
great singing voice, too.

19:20.960 --> 19:26.599
She would have wanted you to
follow your dreams, and so do I.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.604
I hope things are okay
with Corki and her dad.

19:31.638 --> 19:35.275
I'd hate for her to leave
just as I was getting famous.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.310
Sad Sun Hi moment.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.312
Way to make it
all about you.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.649
Thank you for the
words of encouragement.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.450
Ladies!

19:43.483 --> 19:45.017
You didn't
audition for the play.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.819
We tried, but we
were too late.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.856
I'd like to consider tonight's
performance your audition.

19:49.889 --> 19:50.923
Really?

19:50.957 --> 19:52.191
You have parts for us?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.827
Hmmm, girls' roles.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.096
I don't know,
we'll see.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.798
It's very competitive.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.033
Oh, that's okay.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.270
We're really busy
with the band anyway.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.872
Wait, there's roles!

20:05.905 --> 20:06.973
There's plenty of roles!

20:07.006 --> 20:07.907
Ha!

20:07.940 --> 20:11.210
It's about time you
came to your senses.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.349
Mr. Stark: Incoming
cast list...

20:16.383 --> 20:20.253
Make way, make way.

20:20.287 --> 20:23.122
Sun Hi: Our first cast list and
my first starring role!

20:23.155 --> 20:30.797
Let the creativity begin!

20:30.830 --> 20:33.733
Excuse me ... coming through...
star on the way ha ha...

20:33.766 --> 20:35.067
It's just a school play.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.336
Easy for you.

20:36.369 --> 20:41.841
For Sun Hi, it's the, next step
on the road to world domination.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.242
My first starring role.

20:43.276 --> 20:51.618
It's a hashtag moment.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.185
I'm the Scarecrow!

20:54.421 --> 20:58.725
I'm gonna text
Corki the list.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.863
I'm... a tree?

21:03.896 --> 21:05.732
Another tree?!

21:05.765 --> 21:08.735
I'm Yellow Brick
Number Nine!

21:08.768 --> 21:12.772
I'm the lion!

21:12.805 --> 21:17.310
I'm Dorothy!

21:23.249 --> 21:25.318
And I'm...

21:25.352 --> 21:28.655
not on the list.
