01:31.971 --> 01:34.708
He's dead. Bugger off!

02:44.612 --> 02:46.981
Oh, fuck.

03:28.288 --> 03:30.491
All right, let's hear it.

03:30.558 --> 03:33.226
Okay, um...

03:33.293 --> 03:36.964
"'Dragons of Orion'
is boring, absurd,

03:37.031 --> 03:41.167
"and, frankly, it may only
be fit for a prison library

03:41.234 --> 03:43.102
"as an added form of punishment.

03:43.169 --> 03:46.740
"This is the third subpar
release in a row

03:46.807 --> 03:49.175
"from the once renowned
publishing house

03:49.242 --> 03:50.844
"of J.F. Stanbridge.

03:50.911 --> 03:53.681
"It's difficult to tell
if Lucy Stanbridge

03:53.747 --> 03:56.149
"is trying to distance herself
from the series literary fare

03:56.215 --> 03:57.551
"that made the house relevant,

03:57.618 --> 04:00.487
"or if she's simply
not up to the task.

04:00.554 --> 04:02.389
"Perhaps it's time
to give it up, Lucy.

04:02.456 --> 04:04.534
"You clearly didn't inherit
your father's golden touch

04:04.558 --> 04:05.826
for nurturing series material."

04:05.893 --> 04:08.762
What does he know? Nothing.

04:08.829 --> 04:10.564
Young adults don't read
"The Times."

04:10.631 --> 04:11.665
I mean...

04:11.732 --> 04:14.300
Young adults do not
read "The Times."

04:14.368 --> 04:16.168
No, not "The Times."

04:18.672 --> 04:19.773
What?

04:22.009 --> 04:26.914
<i>"Dragons of Orion" is dumb.</i>

04:26.981 --> 04:28.682
<i>All caps, "dumb."</i>

04:28.749 --> 04:30.517
<i>It's trying to be Harry Potter,</i>

04:30.584 --> 04:32.653
<i>but it's not even
a bad "Twilight."</i>

04:32.720 --> 04:34.688
- Who is that?
- Tracy's book club.

04:34.755 --> 04:37.290
She has over
four million followers.

04:37.358 --> 04:39.460
<i>But seriously,
who would write this?</i>

04:39.526 --> 04:41.395
<i>I'd rather just starve</i>

04:41.462 --> 04:43.330
<i>than read another page of this</i>

04:43.397 --> 04:44.632
- <i>brain-sucking...</i>
- Oh, shit.

04:44.698 --> 04:46.533
<i>Mind torture of a book.</i>

04:46.600 --> 04:48.502
I have to get out of here.

05:00.781 --> 05:02.549
You're the best.

05:05.284 --> 05:07.253
You're the best, kiddo.

05:10.189 --> 05:12.359
You're the best.

05:20.166 --> 05:21.468
Shit.

05:21.535 --> 05:23.671
Ugh.

05:45.258 --> 05:47.928
Rachel, we need our own
Drew Davis.

05:47.995 --> 05:49.463
We need to look within.

05:49.530 --> 05:51.365
This is not
brain-sucking mind torture.

05:51.432 --> 05:53.100
Burn it.
We need relevant writers

05:53.167 --> 05:55.569
that can make us relevant again,
okay?

05:55.636 --> 05:57.104
Who do we have in the pipeline?

05:57.171 --> 05:58.539
Lily Dahl, next spring.

05:58.605 --> 06:01.341
Libraries love her.
Bookstores, not so much.

06:01.408 --> 06:03.844
- Mario Actavio.
- Mario Actavio. Yeah.

06:03.911 --> 06:06.747
We need books that sell outside
of Latin America, please.

06:06.814 --> 06:08.082
Henry Dudston.

06:08.148 --> 06:10.316
Yeah, you know,
I got his first three chapters.

06:10.384 --> 06:13.654
It's incomprehensible.
I think he's using again.

06:13.721 --> 06:17.357
- That's the pipeline.
- That's the pipeline?

06:17.424 --> 06:19.927
Everyone else is dead
or unaffordable.

06:19.993 --> 06:21.195
Really? Ahem...

06:21.260 --> 06:22.996
Is there anyone, um...

06:23.063 --> 06:25.399
I don't know, is there anyone
dead we can revive?

06:25.466 --> 06:27.835
Maybe a manuscript
in the basement or something?

06:27.901 --> 06:30.437
Maybe, but pointless.

06:30.504 --> 06:32.406
- And he's not dead.
- Who?

06:32.473 --> 06:33.941
Harris Shaw.

06:35.576 --> 06:37.177
Really? I thought he was dead.

06:37.276 --> 06:40.547
Well, no one has heard of him
since your dad published him.

06:40.614 --> 06:42.281
What's his advance?

06:42.349 --> 06:43.851
It was likely negotiated
in the '70s,

06:43.917 --> 06:46.487
so I'd imagine
it's relatively small.

06:46.553 --> 06:48.088
Let's look up his contract.

06:48.155 --> 06:49.490
Wait, still, Lucy...

06:49.556 --> 06:50.991
What?

06:51.058 --> 06:52.993
He hasn't written anything
since "Atomic Autumn."

06:53.060 --> 06:54.428
So?

06:54.495 --> 06:55.805
Actually, it's all
he's ever written,

06:55.829 --> 06:58.432
and that was almost
50 years ago.

06:58.499 --> 07:01.535
Great. That means
that he's had a lot of time

07:01.602 --> 07:03.904
to come up with something new,
right?

07:03.971 --> 07:05.906
Let's do it.

07:05.973 --> 07:08.242
I mean, he could be dead,
actually.

07:08.307 --> 07:11.211
Okay, am I crazy?
Tell me I'm reading that right.

07:11.277 --> 07:13.113
Um...

07:13.180 --> 07:14.748
a $25,000 advance,

07:14.815 --> 07:17.618
and it looks like
it was already paid.

07:17.684 --> 07:20.154
That means he owes us a book,
right?

07:20.220 --> 07:21.388
- No.
- He owes us...

07:21.455 --> 07:23.490
- I mean...
- Oh, my God.

07:23.557 --> 07:24.725
I wouldn't...

07:24.792 --> 07:26.393
Harris Shaw owes us
a goddamn book.

07:26.460 --> 07:27.928
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, yes.

07:27.995 --> 07:30.430
This is exactly what we need.
This... This could...

07:30.497 --> 07:31.698
This could save the house.

07:31.765 --> 07:33.467
Hold on. Hold on, there's more.

07:33.534 --> 07:35.211
- There's more. There's more.
- What? I knew it.

07:35.235 --> 07:36.870
- Two books.
- Ha.

07:36.937 --> 07:39.373
The legendary Harris Shaw
owes us a book.

07:39.439 --> 07:41.175
Okay, stop mumbling.

07:41.241 --> 07:43.086
- Say it out loud. Out, out.
- There will be no edits.

07:43.110 --> 07:45.379
There will be no edits
or revisions to the draft

07:45.445 --> 07:47.114
submitted by the author.

07:47.181 --> 07:48.549
- Uh...
- What?

07:48.615 --> 07:51.385
Yeah. In exchange,
the author must promote the book

07:51.451 --> 07:53.096
in accordance with
the publisher's request.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.455
Let me see that. Why would
my father agree to this?

07:55.522 --> 07:56.824
Let's just forget about it

07:56.890 --> 07:58.826
and move on to something
more realistic, okay?

07:58.892 --> 08:01.061
Well, doesn't matter.
Harris Shaw is a legend...

08:01.128 --> 08:04.164
- He's a drunk, he's a recluse.
- He is someone that captures...

08:04.231 --> 08:05.799
He's a madman, okay?

08:05.866 --> 08:09.903
You know that story about he
shot his assistant once...?

08:22.382 --> 08:23.650
Let's try again.

08:23.717 --> 08:25.252
Really? I mean, he's probably...

08:25.319 --> 08:26.920
- What was it?
- Okay.

08:26.987 --> 08:28.288
9-1-4...

08:28.355 --> 08:30.757
I'm sorry, darling.

08:30.824 --> 08:32.092
You know?

08:32.159 --> 08:36.630
I knew it was stupid
and foolish and rubbishy.

08:36.697 --> 08:40.900
You know bloody telephones.

08:40.967 --> 08:44.203
Telephones are bullshite,
aren't they?

08:44.270 --> 08:45.906
Hey.

08:45.973 --> 08:47.174
Bullshite.

08:47.241 --> 08:48.742
This is crazy.

08:48.809 --> 08:50.753
We don't even know if he lives
in Westchester anymore.

08:50.777 --> 08:52.946
Well, I don't know.
I guess we'll find out.

08:53.013 --> 08:56.483
Did you know he left Britain
to evade taxes?

08:56.550 --> 08:59.052
Yeah, a lot of famous people
do that.

08:59.119 --> 09:01.722
And he was thrown out of
Ireland for disorderly behavior.

09:01.788 --> 09:03.490
So? He's opinionated.

09:03.557 --> 09:04.758
Ireland, Lucy.

09:04.825 --> 09:07.127
They invented
disorderly behavior.

09:07.194 --> 09:09.062
And here we go again.

09:09.129 --> 09:10.964
He shot his last assistant

09:11.031 --> 09:13.166
because he mistook him
for a bear.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.178
- Oh, I don't believe that.
- How is that even possible?

09:15.202 --> 09:17.437
I don't believe...
You can't believe everything

09:17.504 --> 09:18.972
they put on those websites,
okay?

09:19.039 --> 09:21.041
Anyone can write that stuff.
It's fiction.

09:21.108 --> 09:23.610
- They went to court for it.
- I don't believe it.

09:23.677 --> 09:25.279
No way. He didn't shoot anyone.

09:25.346 --> 09:27.414
We're screwed.

09:31.752 --> 09:33.320
Okay, this is it.

09:33.388 --> 09:34.755
189.

09:36.123 --> 09:37.925
Holy parking tickets.

09:42.996 --> 09:44.598
"Piss off."

09:46.300 --> 09:47.801
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

09:48.902 --> 09:51.204
Well, it was a lovely drive.

09:51.271 --> 09:52.572
Let's go.

09:52.639 --> 09:55.842
Oh, come on.
That's probably a joke.

09:55.909 --> 09:57.177
Mm...

09:57.244 --> 09:58.379
looks pretty serious.

09:58.445 --> 09:59.613
Let's go around back.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.382
Come on. Come on.

10:01.448 --> 10:05.485
See, I think "piss off"
pertains to the whole property.

10:05.552 --> 10:07.422
We're just checking on him,
okay?

10:07.487 --> 10:08.956
Maybe he needs our help.

10:09.022 --> 10:10.425
You don't know.

10:10.490 --> 10:12.926
A lot of neighbors here.

10:15.295 --> 10:16.730
Lucy!

10:16.797 --> 10:18.899
You're officially trespassing.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.635
Rachel, I don't care, okay?

10:21.702 --> 10:23.971
We need this, all right?

10:24.037 --> 10:25.472
Fine. Fine.

10:27.574 --> 10:28.875
Probably dead.

10:28.942 --> 10:30.911
Mummified in some rocking chair.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.613
- Lucy!
- It's an adventure, right?

10:45.959 --> 10:48.128
"Piss off." It says, "piss off."

11:00.307 --> 11:01.708
Mr. Shaw?

11:01.775 --> 11:05.846
Okay, we're officially,
officially trespassing.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.215
It's fine.

11:09.983 --> 11:11.618
Wow.

11:12.686 --> 11:14.221
Look at all these books.

11:19.526 --> 11:20.794
Oh! Oh!

11:20.861 --> 11:22.430
Uh-oh! We're not bears!

11:22.497 --> 11:23.630
We're not bears!

11:23.697 --> 11:25.565
Didn't you see the signs?

11:25.632 --> 11:29.036
I can't stand people
who can't read.

11:29.102 --> 11:33.140
I'm Lucy Stanbridge,
from Stanbridge Publishing.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.215
Thank you.

11:42.282 --> 11:43.984
This is Rachel.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.986
We're so sorry to disturb you.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.655
Love what you've done
with the place.

11:48.722 --> 11:50.090
It's nice.

11:54.594 --> 11:56.497
That's a beautiful cane.

11:56.563 --> 11:58.466
What kind of wood is that?

11:58.533 --> 12:00.600
Blue whale's dick.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.069
Hmm.

12:02.135 --> 12:03.538
Wow.

12:03.603 --> 12:05.373
You're Joe's daughter.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.908
Yes. I'm Lucy.

12:07.974 --> 12:10.277
How is that venal,
toughy-nosed old git?

12:10.344 --> 12:12.346
Um, he's...

12:12.413 --> 12:13.947
not, um...

12:15.048 --> 12:16.451
Not what?

12:16.517 --> 12:18.285
He left the company to me.

12:18.352 --> 12:19.953
He left the company to you?

12:20.020 --> 12:21.355
Yeah, that's what I said.

12:22.956 --> 12:25.759
Joe spoke very highly of you,
and can I just say,

12:25.826 --> 12:27.761
"Atomic Autumn," wow,
that novel is...

12:27.828 --> 12:31.698
I heard your mother
hung herself.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.836
She suffered from depression.

12:37.971 --> 12:39.507
Where's my check?

12:39.574 --> 12:41.141
What check?

12:41.208 --> 12:43.344
The piece of paper that
you change for a sum of money,

12:43.411 --> 12:47.482
the price of the reprint
of "Atomic Autumn."

12:47.548 --> 12:50.150
Yeah, no, that's not why
we're here, Mr. Shaw.

12:50.217 --> 12:52.119
Then why the bloody hell
are you?

12:52.185 --> 12:53.787
Good question.

12:55.288 --> 12:59.726
We at Stanbridge Publishing
were wondering

12:59.793 --> 13:01.161
if you're working
on anything new.

13:01.228 --> 13:03.830
The world doesn't need
anything new from me.

13:03.897 --> 13:05.533
It's been a real pleasure,
Mr. Shaw.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.110
No, we're not done yet.
On the contrary.

13:07.134 --> 13:10.036
I think the world is ready
for new words by you.

13:10.103 --> 13:11.539
Specifically Stanbridge
Publishing.

13:11.606 --> 13:12.806
Rachel, contract.

13:12.873 --> 13:15.175
Now, I know this is from
a long time ago.

13:16.910 --> 13:18.645
If you look here...

13:18.712 --> 13:21.848
I believe that
is your signature.

13:21.915 --> 13:24.284
- Yeah.
- Yes.

13:24.352 --> 13:26.587
So as you can see,

13:26.653 --> 13:28.922
you owe us a book.

13:28.989 --> 13:32.659
Got any manuscripts
collecting dust

13:32.726 --> 13:34.995
on any of these shelves?

13:35.061 --> 13:36.497
Come on.

13:36.564 --> 13:38.599
Anything you want to show me?

13:38.665 --> 13:42.436
I know my dad is the only editor
you've ever worked with, but...

13:44.104 --> 13:46.840
I mean, if I could do a tenth
of what my dad did for you

13:46.907 --> 13:49.276
and "Atomic Autumn,"
then I would have gotten you

13:49.343 --> 13:52.879
a tenth of the way
to a Pulitzer, right?

13:53.747 --> 13:54.981
Whoa.

13:55.048 --> 13:58.251
From the root to the fruit.

14:05.493 --> 14:08.195
- You think that gun was loaded?
- Think that cane was really...

14:16.671 --> 14:18.171
Probably.

15:29.276 --> 15:32.380
<i>I live my life
exactly as I want to</i>

15:32.446 --> 15:34.548
<i>by my own rules
and own standards.</i>

15:34.615 --> 15:37.652
<i>Yeah, I've always been
very interested in writing.</i>

15:39.052 --> 15:40.688
<i>And I remember when I was a boy,</i>

15:40.755 --> 15:43.790
<i>I always read books about
great families and houses.</i>

15:43.857 --> 15:45.493
<i>But is that... I mean,</i>

15:45.559 --> 15:47.827
<i>that's really your sheet
angle, isn't it?</i>

15:47.894 --> 15:51.465
<i>My wife Elizabeth
is a tremendous anchor for me,</i>

15:51.532 --> 15:53.434
<i>is my whole life.</i>

15:53.501 --> 15:55.302
<i>Well, the one thing
you've both got in common</i>

15:55.369 --> 15:57.449
<i>is extraordinary amounts
of money that both of you...</i>

15:57.505 --> 16:00.474
<i>I mean, do you think
that you're worth it?</i>

16:00.541 --> 16:02.108
<i>I remember when I left school,</i>

16:02.175 --> 16:03.778
<i>everybody went into
a regular job,</i>

16:03.843 --> 16:06.243
<i>and I knew they were gonna get
a good living all their lives.</i>

16:06.279 --> 16:10.283
<i>Whereas I could have been
penniless my entire life.</i>

16:10.351 --> 16:12.185
<i>And I was paid on a gamble.</i>

16:32.839 --> 16:35.676
"Asshole.

16:35.743 --> 16:40.880
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you."

16:48.288 --> 16:50.190
I'm really happy for you, Luce.

16:50.256 --> 16:53.026
I am. It's a great deal
for both of us.

16:53.093 --> 16:55.396
Jack's right.
We got a good deal here.

16:55.463 --> 16:58.031
Sorry, the name
of the publishing house

16:58.098 --> 17:00.701
still stays intact.

17:00.768 --> 17:02.268
Of course. Of course.

17:02.336 --> 17:04.571
- Bottom of six.
- Absolutely. Yeah.

17:14.482 --> 17:16.915
- What are you doing?
- Sod off.

17:16.983 --> 17:18.352
Moron.

17:18.419 --> 17:20.887
You cut me off, man.

17:24.759 --> 17:26.291
Move your car!

17:26.359 --> 17:27.694
You're in the fucking way.

17:27.762 --> 17:29.597
- Get the fuck out of the way.
- Oh, my God.

17:29.663 --> 17:32.333
Lucy, I'm really not out
to get you here.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.702
Believe it or not,
I'm actually trying to help.

17:34.769 --> 17:36.269
I am selling you my catalogue,

17:36.337 --> 17:39.407
and you're trying to help me,
Jack? How is that?

17:39.473 --> 17:41.842
I'm offering to keep
your father's legacy intact.

17:41.908 --> 17:43.778
His legacy is intact.

17:43.844 --> 17:45.679
Of course it is. Of course.

17:50.316 --> 17:52.285
Shit.

17:52.353 --> 17:54.230
You think he should have
given the company to you?

17:54.254 --> 17:55.699
I... Did I say that?
I never said that.

17:55.723 --> 17:57.634
- You don't have to say it.
- He, on the other hand,

17:57.658 --> 17:59.493
always called me the son
he never had, so...

17:59.560 --> 18:01.829
- You weren't family.
- No, that's true.

18:01.896 --> 18:05.064
But I came pretty close, though,
didn't I?

18:09.870 --> 18:12.440
Don't bother. I know the way.

18:23.684 --> 18:25.151
Holy shit.

18:34.428 --> 18:38.131
Your pound of flesh,
silver spoon.

18:48.274 --> 18:50.644
You trying to drive up
the price, is that what this is?

18:50.711 --> 18:53.714
Well, a new Shaw book
does add value to the catalogue.

18:55.081 --> 18:56.517
Fine. Shoot me a number.

18:56.584 --> 18:59.319
- There's no longer a number.
- No, no, no, no.

18:59.386 --> 19:01.096
There's publishing,
there's marketing costs.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.723
You're not equipped
to handle this.

19:02.790 --> 19:03.999
That's none of your business,
is it?

19:04.023 --> 19:05.593
He's got a cult following
at best.

19:05.659 --> 19:07.361
Hemingway had a cult following.

19:07.428 --> 19:09.563
Yeah, Hemingway
had Max Perkins to edit him.

19:09.630 --> 19:11.332
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

19:11.398 --> 19:12.900
Lucy, be realistic.

19:12.967 --> 19:14.109
Your father shaped
"Atomic Autumn"

19:14.133 --> 19:15.336
into a best seller.

19:15.402 --> 19:17.404
Who's going to edit this one?
You?

19:18.706 --> 19:20.006
"The Future Is X-Rated."

19:20.073 --> 19:21.351
It sounds like something
from the '80s.

19:21.375 --> 19:22.776
How do you know
if it's any good?

19:22.843 --> 19:24.645
If my dad believed in him,
I believe in him.

19:24.712 --> 19:27.013
Nice weather we're having, huh?

19:27.982 --> 19:29.750
Very much the same
every day, so...

19:32.486 --> 19:34.889
Every day, same... Same weather.

19:34.955 --> 19:36.590
You are in over your head.

19:36.657 --> 19:38.492
- What are you talking about?
- Kid...

19:38.559 --> 19:41.562
get me a Johnnie Walker
Black Label.

19:41.629 --> 19:43.364
Uh, okay.

19:43.430 --> 19:45.366
It's not some silly YA novel.

19:45.432 --> 19:47.276
It's out of your league.
You know it and I know it.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.769
Do we have any Black Label?

19:48.836 --> 19:50.337
Get out.

19:51.438 --> 19:52.439
Now.

19:52.506 --> 19:54.173
It's fitting that the writer

19:54.240 --> 19:55.709
who put this place on the map

19:55.776 --> 19:58.177
is the man who's going
to wipe it clear off.

19:59.480 --> 20:03.617
Phil, we are publishing
this manuscript, okay?

20:03.684 --> 20:05.486
Well, he's right.

20:06.654 --> 20:08.422
You can't afford
the publishing costs,

20:08.489 --> 20:11.291
let alone the advances
on the books already coming in.

20:11.358 --> 20:13.594
Well, then we will borrow it.

20:13.661 --> 20:16.162
The banks aren't going
to lend you any more,

20:16.229 --> 20:18.164
not even with this.

20:19.265 --> 20:21.234
Then transfer it from my trust.

20:22.469 --> 20:25.606
Lucy, that trust was meant
to look after you.

20:26.974 --> 20:29.175
And I was meant to look after
the publishing house.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.352
Times have changed.

20:38.419 --> 20:41.522
So how a book is released today

20:41.589 --> 20:45.492
has become just as meaningful
as its content.

20:47.093 --> 20:49.763
I won't do the bloody tour.

20:50.864 --> 20:52.533
Mr. Shaw, um...

20:52.600 --> 20:54.768
Give me a call
when the check comes in.

20:54.835 --> 20:58.237
You are aware of the contract
that you signed with my father.

20:58.304 --> 21:03.109
The one that states
that you do the tour,

21:03.176 --> 21:05.512
or I edit the book.

21:05.579 --> 21:08.247
So those are your choices.

21:08.314 --> 21:10.851
I'll be damned if I let
the incompetent hand

21:10.918 --> 21:14.021
of nepotism molest my words...

21:14.088 --> 21:16.457
silver spoon.

21:18.025 --> 21:20.226
I'm just thinking about
what's best for the book.

21:20.293 --> 21:21.862
And you think that's you.

21:23.897 --> 21:26.433
You snarky dilettante.

21:26.500 --> 21:27.835
Those are your choices.

21:33.272 --> 21:35.109
All right.

21:35.174 --> 21:37.210
But just the tour.

21:37.276 --> 21:39.046
Fine.

21:39.113 --> 21:40.514
And you got to take care
of Hemmy.

21:40.581 --> 21:42.583
- Hemmy?
- Hemmy's my cat.

21:42.650 --> 21:45.619
He needs medical attention
three times a day.

21:45.686 --> 21:47.253
Great. Rachel's great with cats.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.591
Jeez, my roommate,
she's allergic to cats.

21:50.658 --> 21:53.027
That's okay.
You can stay at my place.

21:53.093 --> 21:54.561
- Not a problem.
- Okay.

21:54.628 --> 21:56.295
Oh, yeah, and I'll need
plenty of

21:56.363 --> 21:58.732
Johnnie Walker Black Label,

21:58.799 --> 22:01.902
White Wolf cigars,

22:01.969 --> 22:04.203
and shelled peanuts.

22:04.270 --> 22:06.106
The salted kind.

22:06.172 --> 22:07.941
Of course.

22:08.008 --> 22:10.878
Also, I don't want
to get up before noon.

22:10.944 --> 22:13.212
Um, I don't do interviews.

22:13.279 --> 22:14.615
And I like my...

22:42.710 --> 22:47.047
And now, it is my great pleasure
to introduce a lion

22:47.114 --> 22:49.183
of American literature.

22:49.248 --> 22:53.252
One of the most controversial
writers of our time...

22:54.488 --> 22:56.255
a national treasure...

22:57.591 --> 23:00.127
You know what? Make that
an international treasure.

23:00.194 --> 23:02.429
An iconoclast.

23:02.496 --> 23:04.631
"An iconoclast."

23:05.899 --> 23:07.459
The author
of "The Future Is X-Rated"...

23:07.501 --> 23:09.002
"Iconoclast."

23:09.069 --> 23:10.704
Mr. Harris Shaw.

23:10.771 --> 23:12.891
You would have loved that
word, wouldn't you, darling?

23:14.975 --> 23:17.778
Who the bloody hell
are you staring at?

23:20.614 --> 23:22.182
At least I wrote my own books.

23:22.248 --> 23:26.019
His life's work
has touched all of us.

23:26.086 --> 23:28.622
"Iconoclast."

23:30.691 --> 23:32.993
Harris Shaw?

23:33.060 --> 23:34.361
Ah.

23:37.131 --> 23:38.465
There he is.

23:42.301 --> 23:43.871
Thank you. Thank you.

23:46.106 --> 23:47.541
There he is.

23:55.783 --> 23:57.551
Thank you.

24:02.523 --> 24:04.091
Good evening.

24:05.959 --> 24:10.330
I came here tonight
to read to you

24:10.397 --> 24:12.499
from my book.

24:13.567 --> 24:15.235
But I have found...

24:15.301 --> 24:17.671
a piece of literature

24:17.738 --> 24:22.209
more compelling and more honest

24:22.276 --> 24:26.380
than anything I could write.

24:28.649 --> 24:32.686
And I want to share it
with you tonight.

24:40.327 --> 24:42.262
Penthouse.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.037
September 1977.

24:52.105 --> 24:57.544
"Lindsay had the ass
of a 12-year-old boy."

24:59.279 --> 25:01.548
"And the kind of tits

25:01.615 --> 25:03.684
"that hung off her

25:03.750 --> 25:08.956
like drops of fresh
morning dew."

25:11.892 --> 25:13.961
Dew. Dew.

25:23.770 --> 25:25.370
<i>So, the profile I made him
is blowing up.</i>

25:25.405 --> 25:27.318
- <i>It's off the charts.</i>
- Thank you for doing that.

25:27.342 --> 25:28.742
Okay, I'll talk to you after.
Bye.

25:28.809 --> 25:31.812
Oh, my God, you really have
the tiger by the tail here.

25:31.879 --> 25:34.081
He's outrageous.

25:34.147 --> 25:35.582
That's Harris Shaw.

25:35.649 --> 25:37.084
That was absolutely horrifying.

25:37.150 --> 25:41.922
But somehow you have over 20,000
followers already.

25:41.989 --> 25:43.457
Incredible.

25:43.523 --> 25:45.759
Christ had followers.

25:45.826 --> 25:47.928
It didn't end well for him.

25:47.995 --> 25:49.630
The Bible was a best seller,
wasn't it?

25:49.696 --> 25:51.366
Lucy Stanbridge. There you are.

25:51.431 --> 25:52.666
Fuck. Shit, shit.

25:52.733 --> 25:54.568
Okay, this man
that is coming towards us

25:54.635 --> 25:56.103
is an absolute nightmare.

25:56.169 --> 25:58.238
He thinks he's Truman Capote.
He has an insane ego.

25:58.305 --> 25:59.406
You have to be nice to him.

25:59.473 --> 26:00.674
And the great Harris Shaw.

26:00.741 --> 26:02.876
Penthouse letters
at a book launch.

26:02.943 --> 26:04.244
Edgy.

26:04.311 --> 26:05.846
Harris, this is Halpern Nolan,

26:05.913 --> 26:07.881
the book reviewer
for "The Times."

26:07.948 --> 26:09.082
Yeah?

26:09.149 --> 26:11.485
I don't like book critics.

26:11.551 --> 26:14.054
Well, I can't help you there.

26:14.121 --> 26:15.721
Did you have a look
at my book, Halprick?

26:15.756 --> 26:18.759
- It's Halpern.
- It's Halpern.

26:18.825 --> 26:20.060
I did.

26:20.127 --> 26:24.431
And I found it frankly
totally pessimistic.

26:24.498 --> 26:26.767
- Well, it has a happy ending.
- Please.

26:26.833 --> 26:28.635
The last woman on earth
is left barren,

26:28.702 --> 26:30.103
and the last man is impotent.

26:30.170 --> 26:31.939
And when they finally
do conceive,

26:32.005 --> 26:33.640
mother and baby die
in childbirth.

26:33.707 --> 26:35.709
How the hell
is that a happy en...?

26:35.776 --> 26:37.611
Harris.

26:37.678 --> 26:40.814
You still are fucking up
the best, Halprick.

26:40.881 --> 26:42.482
- Harris, let him go.
- You're bullshite.

26:42.549 --> 26:44.251
You're all bullshite!

26:44.318 --> 26:46.586
Harris, get off of him.

26:46.653 --> 26:48.522
Jesus!

26:48.588 --> 26:50.157
What the hell
is the matter with you?

26:50.223 --> 26:51.392
Nothing.

26:51.458 --> 26:53.593
You will be hearing
from my attorney.

26:53.660 --> 26:55.095
Halpern.

26:56.331 --> 26:59.166
You, stay. Halpern. Halpern.

26:59.232 --> 27:01.301
Rachel? Call Phil.

27:01.369 --> 27:02.703
Who are you looking at?

27:04.538 --> 27:05.906
Fuck off.

27:05.973 --> 27:07.674
- Halpern!
- He tried to kill me.

27:07.741 --> 27:09.377
I'm calling the police.

27:09.444 --> 27:10.744
Fuck.

27:12.546 --> 27:13.947
You can't cancel the reading.

27:14.014 --> 27:16.516
The book is brilliant
and Shaw is trending, okay?

27:16.583 --> 27:18.218
You know what that means?

27:18.285 --> 27:21.356
He's trending online, you know?
Right up there with, uh...

27:21.422 --> 27:23.056
Just hold on for a second.

27:23.123 --> 27:26.493
Global warming and obese cats.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.662
He is not homophobic, okay?

27:28.729 --> 27:30.130
He hates everybody.

27:30.197 --> 27:32.599
He hates children.
He hates families. He hates me.

27:32.666 --> 27:33.900
Line two.

27:33.967 --> 27:36.069
And, in fact,
"it's all bullshite"

27:36.136 --> 27:38.772
is now the number two...

27:39.873 --> 27:42.477
uh, most popular hashtag.

27:42.542 --> 27:43.686
"Bullshite" is not a bad word.

27:43.710 --> 27:46.447
It just means "bullshit"
in British.

27:47.881 --> 27:49.583
You know, British people
are crazy.

27:49.649 --> 27:51.118
And, by the way,

27:51.184 --> 27:53.920
social media does not represent
the real world, okay?

27:53.987 --> 27:55.822
Hello?

27:55.889 --> 27:57.758
No one has a problem
with Harris Shaw.

27:57.824 --> 28:01.228
He's a very kind old man
who is a...

28:01.294 --> 28:02.929
is a... is a legend.

28:02.996 --> 28:05.333
You publish him first, okay?

28:05.400 --> 28:07.502
So don't look at me like that.

28:07.567 --> 28:09.337
- Yeah?
- Hi.

28:09.404 --> 28:11.238
How's it going?

28:11.304 --> 28:13.173
Everyone's canceling.

28:14.808 --> 28:16.477
The Lizard Lounge has it.

28:16.543 --> 28:18.346
Mm-hmm. What?

28:18.413 --> 28:20.047
The bar in Boston?

28:20.113 --> 28:22.916
They just tweeted an invitation
for Harris to do a reading.

28:22.983 --> 28:24.317
Yeah, it's a bar. Forget it.

28:24.385 --> 28:26.019
Not just any bar.

28:26.086 --> 28:29.723
It's where Harris performed his
spoken word back in the day.

28:29.790 --> 28:31.558
It's where he read
his unpublished stories.

28:31.625 --> 28:34.895
- It's where your father...
- Discovered him.

28:37.697 --> 28:40.100
It's kind of perfect.

28:40.167 --> 28:41.868
Book him.

28:43.203 --> 28:44.505
And I'll go bail him out.

28:44.571 --> 28:47.040
He's already booked.

28:49.009 --> 28:49.943
Good.

28:50.010 --> 28:51.645
<i>Book any damn barn,</i>

28:51.711 --> 28:53.313
<i>any city that canceled us.</i>

28:54.449 --> 28:55.816
<i>We are doing this tour.</i>

29:01.922 --> 29:05.592
I am not riding
in that crotch rocket.

29:10.697 --> 29:13.367
Wee! Whoo!

29:14.734 --> 29:17.671
Sorry. I am a good driver.
I just...

29:17.737 --> 29:20.240
This is backwards for me.

29:24.177 --> 29:25.779
Whee!

29:27.448 --> 29:29.616
This is exciting.

29:37.492 --> 29:40.827
Man, I used to beg my dad
to take me on book tours

29:40.894 --> 29:42.662
when I was little.

29:45.399 --> 29:46.601
But he never would.

29:46.666 --> 29:50.371
He always told me that the road

29:50.438 --> 29:52.507
was no place for a young girl.

29:52.573 --> 29:53.874
So...

29:56.109 --> 29:57.578
do you remember that cartoon

29:57.644 --> 30:00.013
with the coyote
and the roadrunner?

30:00.080 --> 30:02.115
Do you remember that?

30:02.182 --> 30:03.850
We used to watch it
on television,

30:03.917 --> 30:06.286
and my dad, he would point
to the screen and say,

30:06.354 --> 30:09.490
"You can come on tour with me
when you're as quick

30:09.557 --> 30:11.925
and crafty as that roadrunner."

30:11.992 --> 30:15.095
And I never knew
what that meant.

30:17.532 --> 30:18.765
You don't want to talk?

30:18.832 --> 30:20.934
I don't want to talk to you.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.982
The roadrunner's top speed

31:09.049 --> 31:13.454
is about 20 miles an hour.

31:13.521 --> 31:18.693
And the coyote is 43-plus.

31:18.758 --> 31:23.730
So this cartoon is bullshite.

31:26.066 --> 31:31.004
Truth is always
the first casualty.

31:31.071 --> 31:34.040
It's all bullshite.

31:35.842 --> 31:38.646
This is a book tour, you see?

31:38.713 --> 31:41.748
So why don't I read something?

31:41.815 --> 31:43.149
Eh?

31:43.216 --> 31:44.884
- Whoo!
- Come on, dude.

31:46.019 --> 31:48.188
"Bullshite. Bullshite.
Bullshite."

31:48.255 --> 31:51.359
"Bullshite. Bullshite.

31:51.425 --> 31:54.595
"Bullshite. Bullshite.

31:54.662 --> 31:55.795
Bullshite."

31:55.862 --> 31:57.897
- Bullshite.
- Bullshite!

31:57.964 --> 31:59.600
Bullshite. Bullshite.

31:59.667 --> 32:03.903
Bullshite! Bullshite! Bullshite!

32:03.970 --> 32:05.839
Yeah. Bullshite.

32:05.905 --> 32:08.643
Bullshite! Bullshite! Bullshite!

32:08.709 --> 32:11.545
Bullshite! Bullshite!

32:32.400 --> 32:34.901
Bullshite! Bullshite! Bullshite!

32:34.968 --> 32:36.704
He's great.

32:36.771 --> 32:38.339
Yeah.

32:38.406 --> 32:40.106
Yeah!

32:48.416 --> 32:50.817
Just a reminder to everybody

32:50.884 --> 32:54.622
that this man wrote a book.

32:54.689 --> 32:57.725
That it's for sale right now.

32:57.792 --> 32:59.593
I got it live.

32:59.660 --> 33:00.827
Yeah, come on.

33:00.894 --> 33:02.262
Another pour, will you?

33:03.331 --> 33:06.367
Yes, finally,
someone that reads.

33:06.434 --> 33:08.469
Wow.

33:08.536 --> 33:10.338
So, got T-shirts?

33:10.404 --> 33:11.739
No.

33:11.806 --> 33:13.273
I have books.

33:14.542 --> 33:16.076
Uh...

33:16.142 --> 33:18.479
yeah, you should sell T-shirts.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.081
I'll keep that in mind.

33:22.817 --> 33:24.150
Jeez.

33:30.957 --> 33:32.426
I thought that went rather well.

33:32.493 --> 33:34.160
You know, Harris,
it would be helpful

33:34.227 --> 33:35.463
if at the next reading

33:35.529 --> 33:38.599
you would actually read
from the book.

33:38.666 --> 33:40.468
If you won't let me edit it,

33:40.534 --> 33:43.604
at least let me sell it,
okay, Harris?

33:45.004 --> 33:46.072
Harris?

33:46.139 --> 33:49.008
Don't forget the books.

34:14.502 --> 34:16.002
What the fuck?

34:25.011 --> 34:27.447
Bloody hell.

34:48.935 --> 34:50.438
So...

34:50.504 --> 34:53.607
I'm going to read from the book.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.811
"Bullshite. Bullshite.
Bullshite.

34:56.877 --> 34:59.112
Bullshite."

35:17.263 --> 35:19.767
Bullshite! Bullshite! Bullshite!

35:19.834 --> 35:23.704
Bullshite! Bullshite!
Bullshite! Bullshite!

35:33.146 --> 35:35.616
<i>Bullshite. Bullshite.</i>

35:35.683 --> 35:37.183
<i>Bullshite.</i>

35:39.219 --> 35:42.188
<i>Bullshite. Bullshite. Bullshite.</i>

35:43.557 --> 35:44.991
<i>Bullshite.</i>

35:45.058 --> 35:47.093
<i>Bullshite. Bullshite.</i>

35:47.160 --> 35:48.696
<i>Bullshite.</i>

35:48.762 --> 35:50.698
<i>Bullshite! Bullshite!</i>

35:50.764 --> 35:52.433
<i>Bullshite! Bullshite!</i>

35:52.500 --> 35:53.868
I don't get it.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.054
Hipsters are supposed to love
old things, aren't they?

35:56.102 --> 35:58.472
Thrift stores and vinyl.

35:58.539 --> 35:59.874
Communism.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.675
<i>Why isn't the book selling?</i>

36:01.742 --> 36:04.210
We just haven't hit
critical mass.

36:04.277 --> 36:06.188
I may be in critical condition
before that happens.

36:06.212 --> 36:07.548
<i>Can I take your order?</i>

36:07.615 --> 36:08.782
<i>Hold on.</i>

36:08.849 --> 36:10.149
Oh... hi.

36:10.216 --> 36:12.353
- <i>I would like an...</i>
- Okay.

36:12.419 --> 36:15.054
- Hi, can you hear me?
- <i>May I take your order?</i>

36:15.121 --> 36:16.757
<i>Can you speak up?</i>

36:16.824 --> 36:18.091
Damn it.

36:18.157 --> 36:19.793
Wow.

36:20.861 --> 36:22.262
Hold on.

36:22.329 --> 36:24.565
Trust funds, am I right?

36:24.632 --> 36:26.165
Trust what?

36:26.232 --> 36:29.436
Trust... and have fun,
and-and...

36:29.503 --> 36:31.338
<i>and everything
will be all right.</i>

36:31.405 --> 36:34.040
- That's my motto.
- <i>What are you talking about?</i>

36:34.107 --> 36:35.676
I don't need your stupid
mottos, Rachel,

36:35.743 --> 36:36.810
I need book sales.

36:36.877 --> 36:38.044
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
- Hi.

36:38.111 --> 36:39.823
<i>You can take my order.
All right, you know what?</i>

36:39.847 --> 36:41.314
<i>Forget it.
Can I ask you a question?</i>

36:41.382 --> 36:43.817
- Hello?
- Have you heard of Harris Shaw?

36:43.884 --> 36:46.754
<i>That old crazy dude
from the Internet?</i>

36:46.820 --> 36:49.088
Yes, yes, him.
Have you read his book?

36:49.155 --> 36:50.791
<i>He wrote a book?</i>

36:50.858 --> 36:53.192
<i>He pissed on a book.
I didn't know he wrote one.</i>

36:53.259 --> 36:55.029
Odd. This is what
I'm talking about.

36:55.094 --> 36:56.630
Something must be wrong.

36:56.697 --> 36:58.298
<i>Why don't you check
with the vendors,</i>

36:58.365 --> 36:59.843
<i>see if the book is placed
prominently.</i>

36:59.867 --> 37:01.167
Of course, I'm on it.

37:01.234 --> 37:03.202
See if something got lost
in the system.

37:03.269 --> 37:05.606
<i>Are you going
to order something?</i>

37:05.673 --> 37:07.206
What do you want?

37:11.812 --> 37:13.914
Hi, I'm with
Stanbridge Publishing.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.816
This needs to be in the window.

37:15.883 --> 37:17.651
Uh, we're actually focused

37:17.718 --> 37:20.421
on female empowerment
books this month.

37:21.922 --> 37:23.958
Have you met Lucy Stanbridge?

37:24.024 --> 37:27.361
She's the living embodiment
of female empowerment, okay?

37:27.428 --> 37:28.868
You know, if she were here
right now,

37:28.929 --> 37:30.874
she might even tell you
to get your shit together.

37:30.898 --> 37:32.900
So get your shit together.

37:32.967 --> 37:34.401
Please.

37:37.103 --> 37:38.472
Thanks.

37:39.673 --> 37:40.774
Thank you.

37:43.978 --> 37:45.244
What about talk shows?

37:45.311 --> 37:47.715
He's too unpredictable
for network TV.

37:47.781 --> 37:50.249
But the booker at Fallon
said maybe,

37:50.316 --> 37:52.353
if there's a cancelation.

37:52.419 --> 37:53.754
Yes, wake up!

37:53.821 --> 37:54.821
Then cancel someone.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.155
What do you mean,
cancel someone?

37:56.222 --> 37:57.858
I don't know, put out a hit.

37:57.925 --> 37:59.460
Put some ether on a rag
or something.

37:59.526 --> 38:01.895
I don't care how you do it,
just do it!

38:03.162 --> 38:05.099
Oh, no, no, no. He's sleeping.

38:05.164 --> 38:07.001
He's alive. He's sleeping.

38:07.067 --> 38:08.702
He's an old man.

38:08.769 --> 38:10.704
He's Harris Shaw,
the famous author.

38:10.771 --> 38:11.872
Let's go.

38:11.939 --> 38:13.641
Do you want to buy a book?

38:13.707 --> 38:15.342
I have...

38:15.409 --> 38:17.044
- <i>Wake up!</i>
- Lucy?

38:17.111 --> 38:18.612
Harris, come on!

38:18.679 --> 38:23.517
Why doesn't anyone
want to buy your fucking book?

38:23.584 --> 38:26.185
- Has Jack called?
- <i>Repeatedly. He won't stop.</i>

38:26.252 --> 38:27.621
And?

38:27.688 --> 38:29.255
And...

38:29.322 --> 38:30.691
you told me not to answer.

38:30.758 --> 38:33.259
Okay, well, maybe next time
you should.

38:33.326 --> 38:34.662
<i>Look, Harris is already
a legend.</i>

38:34.728 --> 38:36.730
<i>But he's also
a brilliant writer.</i>

38:36.797 --> 38:38.766
<i>Now, get him to read
from the book.</i>

38:40.034 --> 38:41.167
That's...

38:41.234 --> 38:42.703
God, you're funny, Rachel.

38:42.770 --> 38:44.972
- <i>I'm being serious.</i>
- I'm serious.

38:45.039 --> 38:47.240
I'm nothing to Harris.

38:47.306 --> 38:48.776
I can't get him to do anything.

38:48.842 --> 38:51.310
All I am to him
is is fucking driver

38:51.378 --> 38:53.447
and his scotch Sherpa, okay?

38:53.514 --> 38:55.382
<i>You're Lucy Stanbridge.</i>

38:55.449 --> 38:58.085
<i>You're also his editor
and his publisher.</i>

38:58.152 --> 39:01.488
Right, two things he does not
want me to be, believe me.

39:01.555 --> 39:02.890
It's not happening.

39:02.956 --> 39:05.059
Did you order something

39:05.125 --> 39:06.927
from Logo & Go apparel?

39:06.994 --> 39:09.262
<i>I think they're T-shirts
or something.</i>

39:09.329 --> 39:10.864
Uh...

39:10.931 --> 39:12.766
What? I can't hear you.

39:12.833 --> 39:14.300
You're breaking up.

39:22.042 --> 39:23.177
Bugger off.

39:23.242 --> 39:25.311
It's your alcohol!

39:26.980 --> 39:28.382
They're 20 each.

39:28.449 --> 39:30.551
Two for 35.

39:30.617 --> 39:32.653
I'll throw in the book.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.221
I'll throw in two books.

39:35.288 --> 39:37.458
Give you a little discount.

39:37.524 --> 39:41.294
You don't even have to buy it
if you just wear it.

39:48.402 --> 39:50.236
Dive bars and T-shirts.

39:50.303 --> 39:52.339
It's impressive.

39:54.808 --> 39:56.309
It's... It's...

39:56.376 --> 39:57.678
It's part of the new

39:57.745 --> 40:01.081
Harris Shaw lifestyle
brand approach.

40:01.148 --> 40:03.717
What's that, the Martha
Stewart of hard living?

40:03.784 --> 40:05.119
Mm-hmm.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.921
Kale is out. Scotch is in.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.322
Right.

40:11.458 --> 40:12.659
What are you doing here?

40:12.726 --> 40:14.070
Well, I've been
following your tour

40:14.094 --> 40:15.905
and, you know, I wanted
to come check in on you.

40:15.929 --> 40:17.865
You got time for a drink?
I'm buying.

40:30.844 --> 40:32.146
Okay, I just...

40:32.212 --> 40:33.547
I just want to say,

40:33.614 --> 40:35.314
just because I'm giving up

40:35.382 --> 40:39.219
does not mean that I'm going
to let you fuck me on this deal.

40:39.285 --> 40:40.454
I don't...

40:40.521 --> 40:41.855
I don't want to play any games.

40:41.922 --> 40:44.191
No more games.
I don't want to play games.

40:44.258 --> 40:45.659
No more games.

40:47.861 --> 40:50.998
I just feel like I have
something that you want.

40:51.064 --> 40:52.332
- Yeah.
- And so,

40:52.399 --> 40:53.743
I'm going to take
full advantage of it.

40:53.767 --> 40:55.736
- Okay.
- So we'll just...

40:55.803 --> 40:58.472
We'll just call Phil
in the morning, right?

40:58.539 --> 41:00.474
- It's already taken care of.
- Okay.

41:03.076 --> 41:04.545
- Wait.
- What?

41:04.611 --> 41:06.156
- What did you say?
- It's already taken care of.

41:06.180 --> 41:09.016
- It's done, it's good.
- Wait, wait a minute.

41:09.082 --> 41:10.384
How could you...

41:10.450 --> 41:11.895
How could you two
negotiate without me?

41:11.919 --> 41:14.054
- It's my company.
- Don't worry.

41:14.121 --> 41:16.056
It's a fair number.

41:17.758 --> 41:19.927
It's a lower number, isn't it?

41:25.032 --> 41:26.400
Isn't it?

41:29.269 --> 41:30.437
What?

41:30.504 --> 41:32.005
Oh, Jesus.

41:32.072 --> 41:33.974
Unbelievable.

41:34.041 --> 41:35.175
Un-fucking-believable.

41:36.510 --> 41:37.978
Of course it's a lower number.

41:38.045 --> 41:40.080
- You're further in the hole now.
- Oh, my God.

41:40.147 --> 41:41.949
The book still adds value.

41:42.015 --> 41:43.684
No one's interested in the book.

41:43.750 --> 41:45.319
They're interested
in this freak show...

41:45.385 --> 41:47.387
We haven't hit
critical mass, okay?

41:47.454 --> 41:49.723
We're not there yet.
But we will be.

41:49.790 --> 41:51.634
You're dragging the man's
legacy through the mud.

41:51.658 --> 41:53.460
Oh, whatever. His...

41:53.527 --> 41:54.828
Harris's legacy is on him, okay?

41:54.895 --> 41:56.730
I'm talking about your father's.

42:01.336 --> 42:02.669
Get out.

42:13.146 --> 42:15.983
Oh, and when you talk
to Phil in the morning,

42:16.049 --> 42:19.519
please tell him
that he's fucking fired.

42:34.201 --> 42:36.703
<i>The book needed a more
cohesive shape.</i>

42:36.770 --> 42:38.772
<i>A greater unifying thing.</i>

42:38.839 --> 42:40.474
<i>A great editor strains</i>

42:40.540 --> 42:42.276
<i>the metaphorical dregs
from the wine,</i>

42:42.343 --> 42:45.045
<i>and it's clear Mr. Shaw
needs a great editor,</i>

42:45.112 --> 42:48.181
<i>as this new vintage
will not age well, I'm afraid.</i>

42:48.248 --> 42:50.918
<i>Succinctly put,
as usual, Mr. Nolan.</i>

42:50.984 --> 42:54.621
<i>But do you think fans of Shaw's
seminal novel, "Atomic Autumn,"</i>

42:54.688 --> 42:57.491
<i>might still appreciate
"The Future Is X-Rated"?</i>

42:57.557 --> 42:59.626
<i>Mr. Shaw and I
have our differences,</i>

42:59.693 --> 43:01.261
<i>but this isn't personal.</i>

43:01.329 --> 43:05.032
<i>The book is determined
to offend every ideology</i>

43:05.098 --> 43:07.901
<i>that apparently brought on
its so-called event.</i>

43:07.968 --> 43:09.569
<i>It's a laundry list
of grievances</i>

43:09.636 --> 43:11.872
<i>rather than a thoughtful
examination</i>

43:11.939 --> 43:13.341
<i>of how this world came to be.</i>

43:13.408 --> 43:16.276
<i>So, what do you make
of this so-called tour?</i>

43:16.344 --> 43:18.211
<i>Well, while the book
is far from perfect,</i>

43:18.278 --> 43:21.748
<i>I think it deserves better
than its author's urine.</i>

43:21.815 --> 43:24.818
<i>If it's legitimacy
the publisher's looking for,</i>

43:24.885 --> 43:27.888
<i>a circus isn't the best way
to achieve it.</i>

43:27.955 --> 43:29.323
<i>To quote from the book itself,</i>

43:29.390 --> 43:31.792
<i>"Art is not propaganda.</i>

43:31.858 --> 43:34.194
<i>It's an expression
of the truth."</i>

43:43.303 --> 43:44.905
"Art is not propaganda.

43:44.972 --> 43:48.141
It is an expression
of the truth."

43:48.208 --> 43:49.910
Your words.

43:49.977 --> 43:53.847
I want you to read
from the book.

43:55.182 --> 43:57.250
Go and get me
another bloody bottle.

43:58.719 --> 44:01.154
There will be no edits
or revisions

44:01.221 --> 44:02.923
to the draft submitted
by the author.

44:02.990 --> 44:05.959
In exchange, the author
must promote the book

44:06.026 --> 44:08.261
in accordance with
the publisher's request.

44:08.329 --> 44:09.663
I am the publisher,

44:09.730 --> 44:13.567
and my request is that you read
from the book.

44:14.668 --> 44:16.069
It is not selling, okay?

44:16.136 --> 44:17.871
No one is buying it.

44:17.938 --> 44:21.708
You're not very good at your
job, are you, silver spoon?

44:21.775 --> 44:23.243
That is not fair.

44:23.310 --> 44:25.746
You didn't even give me
a chance to edit it.

44:25.812 --> 44:29.484
This book needed
a more cohesive shape.

44:29.549 --> 44:31.018
A great unifying theme.

44:31.084 --> 44:33.320
That's a quote
from public radio.

44:33.388 --> 44:36.823
We're not exactly
Susan-bloody-Sontag, are we?

44:36.890 --> 44:38.692
No, I'm...

44:38.759 --> 44:41.728
From the root to the fruit.

44:41.795 --> 44:43.263
What does that even mean?

44:43.331 --> 44:46.401
It means that you don't have
the fucking freedom

44:46.467 --> 44:48.802
to tell me what to do.

44:48.869 --> 44:50.079
If your words
are so fucking perfect,

44:50.103 --> 44:51.805
then why didn't you
read from it?

44:51.872 --> 44:53.940
Why don't you go and get me
another fucking bottle.

44:54.007 --> 44:56.176
Fine, drink yourself to death.

44:56.243 --> 44:59.112
Meanwhile, I'm going to edit
your fucking stupid book.

44:59.179 --> 45:03.717
Look, this is me
editing your book.

45:03.784 --> 45:05.228
And I'm doing such a great job.
You know why?

45:05.252 --> 45:07.921
Because I got a perfect score
on my SATs.

45:07.988 --> 45:10.991
I got a 3.9 grade point average
at Vassar.

45:11.058 --> 45:13.994
I was president of my class
every fucking year!

45:14.061 --> 45:16.696
I was captain
of the cross-country team.

45:16.763 --> 45:18.131
I worked all the time, okay?

45:18.198 --> 45:20.334
I had no friends
and no personal life,

45:20.401 --> 45:23.937
because I was working
and I was really good at it.

45:24.004 --> 45:28.409
Oh, but all that
is bloody bullshite, isn't it?

45:28.476 --> 45:31.211
It's all fucking bullshite.

45:31.278 --> 45:33.180
I don't need this.

45:33.246 --> 45:34.848
Neither do you, clearly.

45:34.915 --> 45:36.817
Fine.

45:41.522 --> 45:43.023
Fine.

45:45.092 --> 45:47.894
Go and get me a fucking bottle.

45:50.297 --> 45:51.665
Go on.

46:00.874 --> 46:02.577
Fucking hell.

46:20.160 --> 46:22.229
Whoo.

46:28.068 --> 46:29.403
Whoo.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.709
Shh.

47:02.269 --> 47:03.937
Ahem. Read! Read!

47:04.004 --> 47:06.340
Read! Read!

47:06.407 --> 47:08.742
Read! Read! Read!

Read! Read! Read! Read!

47:11.912 --> 47:13.614
Read! Read! Read!

47:13.680 --> 47:16.149
Read! Read! Read! Read!

47:16.216 --> 47:18.352
Don't go now.

47:18.419 --> 47:19.719
You guys, don't go now.

47:19.786 --> 47:21.121
This is bullshite!

47:22.022 --> 47:23.391
All right, I'll be back.

47:23.457 --> 47:25.493
Start the music.

47:31.798 --> 47:32.933
Hey.

47:32.999 --> 47:35.135
You said you were going to read.

47:35.202 --> 47:37.070
You fucking read it to them.

47:37.137 --> 47:38.639
They're not here for me.

47:38.705 --> 47:40.840
And I'm not fucking here
for them.

47:50.050 --> 47:51.461
You know what?
It wouldn't matter anyway,

47:51.485 --> 47:53.588
because no one fucking
reads anymore.

47:57.023 --> 47:58.959
Hashtag "bullshite!"

47:59.025 --> 48:01.027
Read! Read! Read!

48:01.094 --> 48:03.263
They're all pissed in there,
you know.

48:03.331 --> 48:04.465
Bunch of twits.

48:04.532 --> 48:05.666
Bullshite!

48:05.732 --> 48:07.401
Read! Read!

48:08.835 --> 48:11.137
I'll be right back. Don't move.

48:12.607 --> 48:14.408
Hey! Excuse me!

48:14.475 --> 48:16.344
Bullshite, sir.

48:19.813 --> 48:21.549
I'm really sorry, darling.

48:21.616 --> 48:22.983
Really.

48:27.020 --> 48:28.456
<i>"Eden was gone.</i>

48:28.522 --> 48:29.990
<i>"No longer within reach.</i>

48:30.056 --> 48:33.293
<i>It seems God was done
with mistakes."</i>

48:33.361 --> 48:34.894
<i>Is that better?</i>

48:36.397 --> 48:39.232
And you're going
to do the whole book like this?

48:39.299 --> 48:41.301
Well, no.

48:41.369 --> 48:44.271
I mean, just the best
passages, sections.

48:44.338 --> 48:47.107
Well, that was too melodramatic.

48:48.643 --> 48:50.578
Okay, well, we can...

48:50.645 --> 48:52.346
You can choose...

48:52.413 --> 48:54.281
whatever you like.

48:54.348 --> 48:55.949
Okay.

48:56.016 --> 48:58.118
Mm-hmm. I'll try.

48:59.587 --> 49:01.489
<i>"The plate did not come
from a pest or insect.</i>

49:01.555 --> 49:03.857

<i>instead of into
one another's eyes."</i>

49:07.461 --> 49:09.229
<i>Is that what you were
looking for?</i>

49:11.565 --> 49:12.832
What do you think?

49:12.899 --> 49:14.301
Better.

49:15.670 --> 49:18.938
Really? That wasn't
too melodramatic for you?

49:20.708 --> 49:22.175
What else you got?

49:28.114 --> 49:29.750
I was thinking...

49:29.816 --> 49:33.521
"The richest place on earth
had become the graveyards,

49:33.587 --> 49:36.956
because that's where
dreams were buried."

49:39.092 --> 49:40.193
That's some heavy shit.

49:40.260 --> 49:41.995
"He was happy to die.

49:42.062 --> 49:45.366
"Surrender was all he had left.

"Nothing more

49:56.309 --> 49:58.912
"Watching the only other
person left on the planet die

"was a feeling like no other.

"The world instantly felt
ten times as vast and cold,

50:04.951 --> 50:07.887
and gravity seemed
to loosen its grip."

50:10.256 --> 50:11.759
"It was as if
the murals she painted

50:11.826 --> 50:14.060
"were always intended for him.

50:14.127 --> 50:17.063
"He had become the stranger

Wow. Look, Hemmy.

50:38.652 --> 50:41.921
Look, Hemmy. Look.
Do you know who that is?

50:41.988 --> 50:43.524
That's your papa.

50:43.591 --> 50:45.158
Yeah, Harris Shaw.

50:45.225 --> 50:48.329
This here's your trust fund,
okay?

50:51.965 --> 50:53.667
So, the book is selling.

50:53.734 --> 50:56.504
Yes. Sales are up.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.440
All because of this gimmick.

50:59.507 --> 51:02.308
Well, I think
what they're reading

51:02.376 --> 51:04.077
has something to do with it.

51:04.144 --> 51:08.349
I guess you found a way
to mess with me words after all.

51:40.313 --> 51:41.615
Check it out, Shaw.

51:41.682 --> 51:44.284
I'm taking your words
to the grave, man.

51:44.351 --> 51:48.087
Your mother
reared a failed twit.

51:48.154 --> 51:49.824
Thanks.

51:49.890 --> 51:51.525
I can't believe I'm saying this,

51:51.592 --> 51:53.727
but we are sold out.

51:53.794 --> 51:55.295
I'm so sorry.

51:56.430 --> 51:59.533
We are completely sold out.

52:00.601 --> 52:02.603
We're sold out.

52:02.670 --> 52:04.070
Um, announcement!

52:04.137 --> 52:07.341
We are completely sold out

52:14.280 --> 52:16.517

52:16.584 --> 52:18.419
<i>We are completely sold out.</i>

52:18.486 --> 52:20.153
What? Yes!

52:20.220 --> 52:21.522
Yes, yes, yes!

52:21.589 --> 52:23.724
Okay, well,
you're not going to believe

52:23.791 --> 52:24.959
what I'm about to tell you.

52:25.024 --> 52:26.760
What? Good news or bad news?

52:26.827 --> 52:28.729
I just got a call
from that talent coordinator

52:28.796 --> 52:30.029
from the "Tonight Show."

52:30.096 --> 52:31.832
They want Harris
to plug the book.

52:31.899 --> 52:33.968
Oh, my God. Okay.

52:34.033 --> 52:35.636
<i>I know, I know.</i>

52:35.703 --> 52:36.837
When?

52:36.904 --> 52:38.873
- Tomorrow.
- <i>Tomorrow?</i>

52:38.939 --> 52:41.007
As in, like, tomorrow?

52:41.074 --> 52:43.109
Like, he's on the show tomorrow?

52:43.176 --> 52:45.412
You'll be ready, right?

52:45.479 --> 52:47.013
Okay.

52:47.080 --> 52:49.148
You'll be ready. Great.

52:49.215 --> 52:50.384
Good job. Great work.

52:50.451 --> 52:51.952
<i>Harris is going to be great.</i>

52:52.018 --> 52:53.487
Talk soon.

52:59.693 --> 53:01.929
What the bloody hell
are you doing?

53:03.397 --> 53:06.433
Role play. Role play.

53:06.500 --> 53:08.969
- What?
- I'm going to be the host.

53:09.035 --> 53:11.005
You're going to be you...

53:11.070 --> 53:13.039
except nicer.

53:14.608 --> 53:16.777
More likeable.

53:16.844 --> 53:18.111
Come on.

53:18.177 --> 53:20.146
I'm bloody comfortable.
I'm not moving.

53:20.213 --> 53:22.215
Ugh! Fine.

53:23.316 --> 53:24.818
We'll do it here.

53:25.886 --> 53:27.721
Again, I'm the host.

53:27.788 --> 53:30.391
You're you, but censored.

53:30.457 --> 53:31.492
Remember?

53:31.559 --> 53:33.494
- Yeah.
- Okay, action.

53:35.094 --> 53:36.931
Thank you, thank you.

53:36.997 --> 53:38.231
What a great audience.

53:38.298 --> 53:40.701
Hey, did you hear
about the hungry clock?

53:40.768 --> 53:42.068
It went back for seconds.

53:42.135 --> 53:45.739
Ha! Your father should have
left you a bloody talk show.

53:45.806 --> 53:47.841
Yeah. Okay.

53:47.908 --> 53:50.044
Can you just please humor me?

53:50.109 --> 53:52.646
- Okay, go on, then.
- Mr. Shaw,

53:52.713 --> 53:54.213
what is your book about?

53:54.280 --> 53:57.418
Well, it's about 350 pages.

53:57.484 --> 53:59.920
That's very funny, Mr. Shaw.

53:59.987 --> 54:02.623
It's been, what, 40 years

54:02.690 --> 54:05.726
since anyone has seen
or heard from you?

54:05.793 --> 54:08.062
What have you been up to
all this time?

54:08.127 --> 54:10.631
I've been drinking.

54:10.698 --> 54:11.832
Cheers.

54:13.601 --> 54:16.604
You can't drink
on television, Harris.

54:16.670 --> 54:18.439
This is going
to happen tomorrow.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.641
- Oh.
- I'm going to ask you again.

54:20.708 --> 54:23.043
Harris, it's been
a really long time

54:23.109 --> 54:24.745
since anyone's seen you.

54:24.812 --> 54:26.647
What have you been up to
all this time?

54:28.082 --> 54:30.116
- Drinking.
- Goddamn it.

54:30.985 --> 54:32.553
But why publish now? Huh?

54:32.620 --> 54:35.656
What was the inspiration
for this new book?

54:35.723 --> 54:37.190
Money.

54:39.125 --> 54:40.427
Money?

54:40.494 --> 54:43.330
Well, I didn't have
a lot else to do anyway,

54:43.397 --> 54:44.999
so, you know...

54:45.065 --> 54:46.299
- Money and boredom.
- Yeah.

54:46.367 --> 54:48.167
If you're really bored
you start writing.

54:48.234 --> 54:50.437
So you might as well
make some money.

54:50.504 --> 54:52.606
See, people have
switched the channel by now.

54:52.673 --> 54:54.975
You wrote your new book
because of money.

54:55.042 --> 54:56.677
- Yeah, money.
- You know,

54:56.744 --> 54:59.380
- despite your mantra...
- I need the money.

54:59.446 --> 55:02.449
The very popular
hashtag "bull..." bleep

55:02.516 --> 55:05.786
is sweeping the nation.

55:05.853 --> 55:07.054
But I read the book,

55:07.121 --> 55:09.757
and I happen to think that...

55:09.823 --> 55:13.761
there's an element of truth
behind those words.

55:14.862 --> 55:16.063
That's right.

55:16.130 --> 55:19.298
A profound, deeper meaning
that you're getting at.

55:19.366 --> 55:21.035
Toughy-nosed git.

55:22.336 --> 55:25.039
You can't call the host names.

55:25.105 --> 55:27.074
I'm not talking to the host.

55:28.475 --> 55:31.011
Go ahead, give me an example

55:31.078 --> 55:34.448
of the truth in my book.

55:34.515 --> 55:36.950
You want to know what I think?

55:37.017 --> 55:38.452
Yeah.

55:38.519 --> 55:41.320
Well, you said you knew
about the truth.

55:41.388 --> 55:44.391
Tell me the bloody truth.

55:46.727 --> 55:51.932
Mary and the baby die
during childbirth, right?

55:51.999 --> 55:55.234
And Arthur says that he's going
to bury himself alive

55:55.301 --> 55:57.203
along with them.

55:57.270 --> 55:58.706
But he doesn't do it.

55:58.772 --> 55:59.807
He can't do it.

55:59.873 --> 56:03.309
And your words imply
that he's a coward

56:03.377 --> 56:04.845
because of that.

56:04.912 --> 56:06.447
But I don't...

56:06.513 --> 56:09.349
I don't think that's true.

56:10.951 --> 56:15.055
Because the wealthiest place
on earth is not, as you write,

56:15.122 --> 56:16.724
the graveyard.

56:16.790 --> 56:18.792
It's being alive.

56:20.226 --> 56:22.963
Even if you're left
completely alone.

56:23.030 --> 56:26.433
What you don't realize is that
you have completely failed

56:26.500 --> 56:29.970
to rob the last man
on earth of hope.

56:30.037 --> 56:31.338
Hope.

56:33.272 --> 56:34.908
That's the truth that I found.

56:36.810 --> 56:39.179
Oh, my God.

56:42.315 --> 56:44.651
Did you write all this down?

56:46.386 --> 56:49.356
Yeah, it all on the manuscript
in the car.

56:50.190 --> 56:52.258
Go and get the manuscript.

56:52.325 --> 56:54.828
- Really?
- Please.

57:00.134 --> 57:01.568
Bloody hell.

57:07.508 --> 57:09.209
- Hey.
- <i>Just so you know,</i>

57:09.275 --> 57:11.445
<i>agents are calling.</i>

57:11.512 --> 57:14.414
They want to send us
manuscripts.

57:14.481 --> 57:15.649
What are you talking about?

57:15.716 --> 57:17.351
<i>The call I just got</i>

57:17.417 --> 57:20.286
<i>from Drew Davis's agent
was particularly interesting.</i>

57:20.354 --> 57:21.822
Rachel, do not play with me.

57:21.889 --> 57:23.791
<i>She wants to meet with you.</i>

57:23.857 --> 57:27.694
She's very intrigued by your
commitment to Harris Shaw.

57:27.761 --> 57:29.797
Oh, my God. Harris Shaw.

57:29.863 --> 57:32.232
Fucking I knew it.

57:32.298 --> 57:34.168
I knew it.

57:34.234 --> 57:35.903
- How's he doing?
- <i>You know what?</i>

57:35.969 --> 57:38.071
<i>I think he's starting
to respect me.</i>

57:38.138 --> 57:40.073
I think he wants
to see my edits.

57:41.875 --> 57:43.043
You made edits?

57:43.110 --> 57:46.146
<i>I'm sure they're great.</i>

57:46.213 --> 57:47.714
<i>But don't show it to him.</i>

57:47.781 --> 57:49.449
Well, he asked to see them.

57:49.516 --> 57:51.552
Lucy, why rock the boat

57:51.618 --> 57:53.319
when you're this close to shore?

57:55.455 --> 57:57.257
Yeah, no. Yeah.

57:57.323 --> 57:59.493
You know what I mean, right?

57:59.560 --> 58:01.195
Yeah. Okay.

58:01.261 --> 58:02.696
<i>Have a good night.</i>

58:02.763 --> 58:03.964
Bye.

58:21.648 --> 58:24.852
Unity of effect?

58:24.918 --> 58:26.086
Unity of effect.

58:26.153 --> 58:29.189
It's the effect of the book
on the reader

58:29.256 --> 58:30.557
is the purpose of the piece.

58:30.624 --> 58:33.594
- Oh, yeah? Ah.
- It's the unity of effect?

58:33.660 --> 58:37.364
You mean that your
Papa Stanbridge,

58:37.431 --> 58:41.602
he donated a wing to your school

58:41.668 --> 58:45.873
so that you could understand
this bloody phrase.

58:47.140 --> 58:48.876
Just forget about it.
Just... You know what?

58:48.942 --> 58:51.778
Just forget...
Forget this ever happened, okay?

58:51.845 --> 58:53.747
I don't fucking forget easily.

58:53.814 --> 58:55.115
You want to know something?

58:55.182 --> 58:58.785
You are trying to accomplish
two things at once,

58:58.852 --> 59:01.188
when you only need
to accomplish one.

59:01.255 --> 59:02.589
Yeah?

59:02.656 --> 59:03.957
Can you remember that?

59:04.024 --> 59:07.461
Sometimes a man

59:07.527 --> 59:10.898
has to dare to be ambitious.

59:10.964 --> 59:13.267
For instance,

59:13.334 --> 59:14.768
I'm about to smoke...

59:17.571 --> 59:19.439
and piss...

59:20.407 --> 59:21.575
at the same time.

59:21.642 --> 59:23.744
- Ugh.
- Yes.

59:23.810 --> 59:29.283
And I think you should stick
to your young adult bullshite

59:29.350 --> 59:31.518
that you keep churning out.

59:41.628 --> 59:42.963
You like what I...

59:43.030 --> 59:44.765
You like what I had
to say earlier.

59:44.831 --> 59:46.733
You asked to see my edits.

59:46.800 --> 59:48.602
You said you wanted to see them.

59:48.669 --> 59:50.704
Fucking fraud.

59:52.539 --> 59:55.042
You fucking fraud.

01:00:09.723 --> 01:00:12.292
I don't care what you think,
okay?

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.161
I don't fucking care.

01:00:14.227 --> 01:00:15.729
Yeah?

01:00:15.796 --> 01:00:17.798
Well, it doesn't look like it
from here.

01:00:21.268 --> 01:00:22.602
You know how much I care

01:00:22.669 --> 01:00:25.906
about you and your famous
stupid book?

01:00:25.973 --> 01:00:28.909
I've never even read
"Atomic Autumn."

01:00:28.976 --> 01:00:29.910
I've nev...

01:00:29.977 --> 01:00:32.112
Okay, okay.

01:00:32.179 --> 01:00:33.647
Wait. Hold on.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:38.218
Heave away.

01:00:39.786 --> 01:00:41.456
I've got you, all right?

01:00:41.521 --> 01:00:43.623
You're done. You're done.

01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:46.159
Okay, give me your hand.

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:48.095
Give me your hand.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:56.404
You know, my dad told me

01:00:56.471 --> 01:00:58.105
that the greatest day
of his life

01:00:58.171 --> 01:01:00.140
was when he published your book.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:05.812
If he chose the book over you...

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.015
he chose wrong.

01:01:11.651 --> 01:01:14.087
I always wanted to be
just like him.

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:18.859
The great Joseph Stanbridge.

01:01:20.193 --> 01:01:24.865
"You're the best, kiddo.
You're the best."

01:01:26.501 --> 01:01:29.302
That's what he used to say to
me after I'd read to him.

01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:36.176
So we beat on...

01:01:37.844 --> 01:01:39.112
boats against the current,

01:01:39.179 --> 01:01:44.317
borne back ceaselessly
into the past.

01:01:44.385 --> 01:01:45.552
The past.

01:01:47.154 --> 01:01:48.588
Gatsby.

01:01:48.655 --> 01:01:50.857
Oh, well, is that a fact?

01:01:52.692 --> 01:01:56.063
It was Elizabeth's
favorite book.

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:57.764
Hmm.

01:02:01.868 --> 01:02:03.270
What was she like?

01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:05.972
Huh?

01:02:06.039 --> 01:02:10.243
You ever hear people talk about
the one that got away?

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.611
Yeah.

01:02:11.678 --> 01:02:15.816
Well, I was the one
who married her.

01:02:18.852 --> 01:02:19.986
Well, if she was so special,

01:02:20.053 --> 01:02:21.389
why the hell
would she marry you?

01:02:24.791 --> 01:02:29.830
Well, even the worst of us
get lucky.

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:37.037
Hey, I'll show you something.

01:02:37.104 --> 01:02:40.307
This is a picture of us when...

01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:44.945
we were at this book award.

01:02:47.881 --> 01:02:50.518
Look the hell up.
You see? See there?

01:02:50.585 --> 01:02:52.953
- Mm-hmm.
- That's a beer stein.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:56.089
You know what it was full of?

01:02:56.156 --> 01:02:57.324
Champagne.

01:02:59.793 --> 01:03:03.964
It's so typical of Elizabeth.

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.572
I'm going to read
your book, Harris.

01:03:11.638 --> 01:03:13.240
Okay?

01:03:14.941 --> 01:03:16.643
I'm going to read it.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:19.079
Oh, yeah? I don't doubt it.

01:04:11.432 --> 01:04:14.868
You look like
you might need this.

01:04:24.545 --> 01:04:26.079
Thank you.

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:37.425
What are you doing?

01:04:37.491 --> 01:04:40.695
I thought if I made
another pass,

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.963
we might reissue the book.

01:04:49.403 --> 01:04:51.171
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:04:52.473 --> 01:04:53.807
Maybe.

01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:05.085
And maybe we could work
on the next one together.

01:05:06.354 --> 01:05:07.521
Next one?

01:05:09.222 --> 01:05:10.458
Yeah.

01:05:10.524 --> 01:05:11.934
Well, after you go
on the show tonight,

01:05:11.958 --> 01:05:13.293
they're going to want more.

01:05:13.361 --> 01:05:16.430
Let's just not wait
another 40 years, okay?

01:06:00.541 --> 01:06:01.875
Hello?

01:06:24.498 --> 01:06:28.001
So, we have to make a quick stop
along the way.

01:06:28.068 --> 01:06:29.670
Some business.

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:31.871
I'm in no hurry.

01:06:31.938 --> 01:06:34.408
Okay, good.

01:06:34.475 --> 01:06:36.176
It won't take long.

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:38.713
Fuck.

01:06:38.779 --> 01:06:40.748
I told you, go straight
forward and sit like that.

01:06:40.815 --> 01:06:42.315
There you go.

01:06:42.383 --> 01:06:43.917
Got it.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:17.778
Hi.

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:19.513
So sorry I'm late.

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.515
I'm just glad you finally
made it in person.

01:08:21.582 --> 01:08:24.385
Yeah. So has there been a change

01:08:24.452 --> 01:08:26.921
in his medication
or his routine?

01:08:26.986 --> 01:08:28.321
Everything is the same.

01:08:28.389 --> 01:08:31.358
He was fine until he saw
some man on the news.

01:08:31.425 --> 01:08:34.127
- Really?
- He was as docile as could be.

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:36.261
And then this.

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:02.055
Holy shit.

01:09:03.457 --> 01:09:05.291
Oh, bloody hell.

01:09:06.527 --> 01:09:07.627
Lucy?

01:09:10.531 --> 01:09:13.066
Sir, are you supposed
to be out of your room?

01:09:13.131 --> 01:09:14.801
Sod off.

01:09:14.868 --> 01:09:16.069
Oh.

01:09:16.135 --> 01:09:17.438
Lucy.

01:09:18.639 --> 01:09:21.040
I'm so sorry. I...

01:09:21.107 --> 01:09:23.544
Did you see him do this?

01:09:23.611 --> 01:09:24.712
Lucy!

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.448
- What's going on?
- Jesus.

01:09:27.515 --> 01:09:29.917
This is like a fiendish
incarnation of fucking hell!

01:09:29.984 --> 01:09:32.185
Okay, Harris,
can you please wait in the car?

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:35.421
I promise I'll explain
everything later.

01:09:35.488 --> 01:09:36.689
Please?

01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:40.794
What?

01:09:41.895 --> 01:09:43.029
Look.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:45.332
Those are my fucking words.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:46.934
What do you mean, your words?

01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:50.470
This. Those are my words
scribbled on that wall.

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:55.275
Who the fuck has done that?
I've never been here.

01:10:05.352 --> 01:10:08.622
There's someone here
that wants to see you.

01:10:10.056 --> 01:10:12.225
It's Harris Shaw.

01:10:18.399 --> 01:10:20.968
He hasn't had
a lucid moment in...

01:10:48.829 --> 01:10:50.163
Dad?

01:10:51.699 --> 01:10:53.132
Dad.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:55.903
Dad, can you hear me?

01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:58.539
Daddy, it's Lucy.

01:11:06.513 --> 01:11:08.181
Harris?

01:11:12.019 --> 01:11:14.455
Hey, what just happened
in there.

01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:17.791
You made out
he was fucking dead.

01:11:17.858 --> 01:11:19.192
I...

01:11:19.258 --> 01:11:21.127
Harris, why did he
look at you like that?

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:22.763
He knows he's a goddamn fraud.

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:23.664
What?

01:11:23.731 --> 01:11:24.965
That's what happened in there.

01:11:25.032 --> 01:11:28.435
Right, here we go.
It's all bullshite, right?

01:11:29.603 --> 01:11:32.706
That man found you, remember?

01:11:32.773 --> 01:11:34.207
That man made you.

01:11:34.273 --> 01:11:36.877
My wife made me.

01:11:36.944 --> 01:11:38.045
What?

01:11:38.112 --> 01:11:39.346
What are you saying?

01:11:39.413 --> 01:11:41.548
Joseph pretended
to be a great editor,

01:11:41.615 --> 01:11:44.250
but he didn't touch
a fucking word.

01:11:44.317 --> 01:11:45.218
That's not true.

01:11:45.284 --> 01:11:47.421
Elizabeth did it all.

01:11:47.488 --> 01:11:50.758
Joseph, he's not an editor.

01:11:50.824 --> 01:11:52.158
He's a bloody thief.

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:53.527
No.

01:11:54.628 --> 01:11:55.763
That's not true.

01:11:55.829 --> 01:11:57.331
Mm-hmm.

01:11:57.398 --> 01:12:01.402
Your precious little daddy
is a fucking liar!

01:12:04.071 --> 01:12:06.640
Then why didn't you
fucking tell me that?

01:12:06.707 --> 01:12:09.576
If that's true,
then why did you tell everyone?

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:11.979
Money.

01:12:12.046 --> 01:12:14.848
We didn't have any money.

01:12:16.215 --> 01:12:17.518
Elizabeth was pregnant.

01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:19.620
She wanted this house
more than anything.

01:12:19.687 --> 01:12:24.692
And she said I'll get the
credit on the next book.

01:12:24.758 --> 01:12:26.060
It doesn't matter.

01:12:26.126 --> 01:12:29.430
She said,
"We'll get it next time."

01:12:31.065 --> 01:12:33.199
But, of course,

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:36.503
there wasn't a next time.

01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:40.541
I mean, there couldn't
be a next time without her.

01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:44.243
I'm nothing...

01:12:44.945 --> 01:12:46.680
without her.

01:12:53.487 --> 01:12:55.689
You think you're a fraud?

01:12:55.756 --> 01:12:57.958
That's it.

01:12:58.025 --> 01:12:59.126
Right?

01:12:59.193 --> 01:13:00.494
Fuck you.

01:13:02.261 --> 01:13:04.798
- And leave me alone.
- Harris...

01:13:04.865 --> 01:13:06.232
Get out of here.

01:13:46.874 --> 01:13:49.376
- Come on, move it!
- I'm walking over here.

01:13:49.443 --> 01:13:51.912
Get the fuck out of the way.

01:13:53.947 --> 01:13:55.849
You're going to get
yourself killed, man.

01:13:55.916 --> 01:13:57.651
- Watch it.
- Get out of the way!

01:13:57.718 --> 01:13:59.620
Sod off!

01:14:10.364 --> 01:14:12.298
- Look, it's him.
- Are you sure?

01:14:12.366 --> 01:14:14.268
Yeah, look in the window.

01:14:14.334 --> 01:14:16.302
OMG, you're Harris Shaw.

01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:18.505
Fuck off, you wankers.

01:14:18.572 --> 01:14:20.274
Harris Shaw
just called us wankers.

01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.409
That's so awesome!

01:14:22.476 --> 01:14:23.877
What's it mean?

01:14:26.312 --> 01:14:28.348
- Hold on.
- Okay.

01:14:49.336 --> 01:14:50.871
Fucking fraud.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.788
<i>If it was meant
as a publicity stunt,</i>

01:16:14.855 --> 01:16:16.623
<i>it seems to have worked.</i>

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.125
<i>The book continues to climb</i>

01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:20.160
<i>the "New York Times"
best seller list.</i>

01:16:20.227 --> 01:16:21.862
<i>Shaw's no stranger
in controversy,</i>

01:16:21.929 --> 01:16:24.131
<i>with incidents
of public indecencies...</i>

01:16:24.197 --> 01:16:26.334
<i>And tonight, people everywhere</i>

01:16:26.401 --> 01:16:29.169
<i>are burning the book
in a show of solidarity.</i>

01:16:29.236 --> 01:16:32.639
<i>Harris Shaw has certainly
made his mark.</i>

01:16:32.706 --> 01:16:35.075
<i>We're all hoping
for a speedy recovery.</i>

01:16:46.787 --> 01:16:48.655
Uh, well, we are so thrilled

01:16:48.722 --> 01:16:52.059
that you'd even consider us,
Miss Davis.

01:16:52.125 --> 01:16:55.963
I want to push boundaries.
Get edgier, Lucy.

01:16:56.029 --> 01:16:58.465
I mean,
not "pee on my book" edgy,

01:16:58.532 --> 01:17:00.435
but, no, the culture today,

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.736
the man's "we be provocative."

01:17:02.803 --> 01:17:04.671
And given what you've done
with Shaw,

01:17:04.738 --> 01:17:06.773
I think you might
be just what I need.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.141
So, does that mean

01:17:08.208 --> 01:17:09.943
that there's a provocative book
on the way?

01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:14.648
A marriage on the rocks.
Literally.

01:17:14.715 --> 01:17:17.084
A couple decides
to test their compatibility

01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:19.553
by attempting to summit
Mount Everest together.

01:17:19.619 --> 01:17:23.657
But a fight for their marriage
becomes a fight for their lives.

01:17:23.724 --> 01:17:28.295
Nicholas Sparks
meets Jon Krakauer.

01:17:28.363 --> 01:17:29.596
- You get me?
- Yeah.

01:17:29.663 --> 01:17:31.432
Are you ready for the title?

01:17:31.498 --> 01:17:33.633
Yes.

01:17:35.102 --> 01:17:36.471
"Foreverest."

01:17:36.536 --> 01:17:39.172
"Foreverest." Wow.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.776
I'm sorry, this is the hospital.

01:17:42.843 --> 01:17:45.312
I'm just going to take this.

01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:47.382
Hello? Yes.

01:17:47.448 --> 01:17:49.082
So sorry about that.

01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:50.817
An emergency.

01:17:52.953 --> 01:17:56.656
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you're saying.

01:17:56.723 --> 01:17:58.558
What are you saying?

01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:00.594
Heart disease.

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.329
Lung cancer.

01:18:02.397 --> 01:18:03.964
Cirrhosis of the liver.

01:18:06.199 --> 01:18:09.736
Okay, so is there
anything you can do?

01:18:09.803 --> 01:18:11.805
I'm afraid there isn't.

01:18:12.973 --> 01:18:14.107
I...

01:18:15.476 --> 01:18:17.611
I don't understand
what that means.

01:18:17.677 --> 01:18:19.414
What...

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:21.148
What are we supposed to do then?

01:18:26.387 --> 01:18:27.754
We help him die.

01:18:36.863 --> 01:18:38.598
Come on out.

01:18:38.665 --> 01:18:40.501
Come on, Hemmy. It's time to go.

01:18:40.567 --> 01:18:42.135
Good boy.

01:18:42.202 --> 01:18:43.371
This is crazy.

01:18:43.438 --> 01:18:45.238
What about work?

01:18:45.305 --> 01:18:46.807
Um, you know,

01:18:46.873 --> 01:18:49.643
I can do my end remotely.

01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:52.746
And what about Drew Davis?

01:18:52.813 --> 01:18:55.282
Drew Davis can wait.

01:18:55.349 --> 01:18:57.984
- What is that?
- He needs this. It's his bird.

01:19:02.289 --> 01:19:05.359
Hey, handsome.
Looking for a ride?

01:19:28.148 --> 01:19:31.051
So you're officially
a best seller now.

01:19:32.487 --> 01:19:35.055
I should have set myself
on fire sooner.

01:19:36.823 --> 01:19:38.191
You know, that would
have saved me

01:19:38.258 --> 01:19:39.793
a lot of time and money.

01:19:42.563 --> 01:19:44.532
If it makes you feel any better,

01:19:44.599 --> 01:19:48.201
some kids are actually burning
the book after they read it.

01:19:53.106 --> 01:19:55.876
You don't have
to stick around, you know.

01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:02.749
Maybe I want to stick around.

01:20:06.521 --> 01:20:08.356
It won't be for long.

01:20:47.694 --> 01:20:49.129
Welcome home.

01:20:49.196 --> 01:20:51.865
What the hell did you do?

01:20:51.932 --> 01:20:53.434
Not much.

01:20:53.501 --> 01:20:55.369
Just tidied up a little bit.

01:20:56.903 --> 01:20:58.738
I'm going to go get your stuff.

01:20:58.805 --> 01:21:00.106
Okay.

01:21:02.643 --> 01:21:04.579
Who put a collar on you?

01:21:04.645 --> 01:21:05.912
Come here.

01:21:05.979 --> 01:21:08.215
Come and be with me.

01:21:08.281 --> 01:21:09.450
Oh!

01:21:09.517 --> 01:21:10.651
Hey.

01:21:10.717 --> 01:21:11.952
Come around.

01:21:12.018 --> 01:21:13.787
Oh, that's it.

01:21:13.853 --> 01:21:15.222
Give me a kiss.

01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:16.990
Oh, I love you.

01:21:17.057 --> 01:21:18.959
I love you so much.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.194
Are you comfortable?

01:21:21.261 --> 01:21:23.331
Do you want more blankets
or pillows or...?

01:21:23.397 --> 01:21:27.000
No, I'm comfortable
thank you very much.

01:21:28.068 --> 01:21:29.736
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:22:34.568 --> 01:22:36.570
I read "Atomic Autumn."

01:22:40.775 --> 01:22:42.075
And?

01:22:42.142 --> 01:22:43.310
And...

01:22:47.682 --> 01:22:49.049
I think it's...

01:22:50.016 --> 01:22:52.018
really good.

01:22:52.085 --> 01:22:55.055
And the ending, I just...

01:22:56.222 --> 01:22:59.893
trying to decide
between him and her freedom.

01:23:00.994 --> 01:23:02.630
And then she leaves.

01:23:02.697 --> 01:23:04.064
It's just...

01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:06.334
God, it's so gutsy, it's...

01:23:07.967 --> 01:23:09.737
How did you...?

01:23:09.804 --> 01:23:11.104
Why did you do that?

01:23:11.171 --> 01:23:13.741
I wanted to write
a cautionary tale,

01:23:13.808 --> 01:23:18.945
but my wife only believed
in bold choices.

01:23:19.012 --> 01:23:22.282
There were no lies in her fire.

01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:26.252
And you have that same fire,
don't you, love?

01:23:27.588 --> 01:23:28.922
Hmm?

01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:31.625
- I do?
- Yeah.

01:23:35.128 --> 01:23:37.598
I want to go out.

01:23:37.665 --> 01:23:39.667
You want to go outside?

01:23:39.734 --> 01:23:40.867
Yes.

01:23:40.934 --> 01:23:42.936
Help me get dressed

01:23:43.002 --> 01:23:44.904
and I'll tell you why.

01:23:49.075 --> 01:23:52.912
This is where she used to come
to read.

01:23:54.314 --> 01:23:55.949
What happened to her?

01:23:57.083 --> 01:23:58.586
Uh, we...

01:24:02.623 --> 01:24:04.425
we lost the baby, and...

01:24:08.261 --> 01:24:11.297
Elizabeth went a week later.

01:24:13.534 --> 01:24:17.003
I should have done this
years ago.

01:24:21.908 --> 01:24:24.043
When I go...

01:24:25.546 --> 01:24:27.415
spread me here.

01:24:30.216 --> 01:24:32.085
It's where I belong.

01:24:35.556 --> 01:24:38.057
Harris, do you want me
to call anyone?

01:24:38.124 --> 01:24:40.326
Like a friend, or family, or...?

01:24:41.529 --> 01:24:44.998
No, the cat's got all the names.

01:24:50.003 --> 01:24:52.673
It's time that you do...

01:25:46.059 --> 01:25:47.260
- Good day, ma'am.
- Hello.

01:25:47.327 --> 01:25:49.730
Verne Olson. Eastern Mutual.

01:25:49.797 --> 01:25:53.767
Five hundred thousand dollars?
Really? How is that possible?

01:25:55.469 --> 01:25:58.839
He took a line of credit out
against the house in 2005.

01:25:58.906 --> 01:26:00.574
Right.

01:26:00.641 --> 01:26:02.443
This book went out of print.

01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:04.210
Pardon me?

01:26:04.277 --> 01:26:06.117
Well, he doesn't have
this kind of money, so...

01:26:06.145 --> 01:26:07.915
Harris Shaw?

01:26:07.982 --> 01:26:09.550
I find that a little hard
to believe.

01:26:09.617 --> 01:26:11.227
He's not going to get
a return on the book

01:26:11.251 --> 01:26:12.620
for at least six months.

01:26:12.686 --> 01:26:15.789
Well, surely you could
get him an advance, or...?

01:26:15.856 --> 01:26:17.290
No. That's not...

01:26:17.358 --> 01:26:19.426
Yeah, that's not how it works.

01:26:20.861 --> 01:26:22.897
Um, Mr. Olson,

01:26:22.963 --> 01:26:25.031
look, this house
is really special.

01:26:25.098 --> 01:26:27.801
He's written
his life's work here.

01:26:27.868 --> 01:26:31.070
His wife died here.

01:26:31.137 --> 01:26:32.640
His...

01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:37.210
He wants to live out
his life here.

01:26:37.277 --> 01:26:39.245
I mean, what are you going
to do, kick him out?

01:26:39.312 --> 01:26:40.648
He's Harris-fucking-Shaw, okay?

01:26:40.714 --> 01:26:42.950
This house should be deemed
historical.

01:26:43.017 --> 01:26:45.619
It should be turned
into a museum or something.

01:26:45.686 --> 01:26:46.987
I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:26:47.053 --> 01:26:48.756
He pays back the $500,000,

01:26:48.822 --> 01:26:51.458
or it'll hit the market
in two weeks.

01:26:54.929 --> 01:26:58.064
The buggers just used to call
or send lettuce.

01:27:01.435 --> 01:27:04.137
They tried to throw me
out of here.

01:27:05.773 --> 01:27:07.206
Yeah.

01:27:11.545 --> 01:27:13.447
I'm a best-selling author.

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.355
Lucy...

01:27:22.489 --> 01:27:24.858
they can't do that, right?

01:27:24.925 --> 01:27:26.360
- No?
- No.

01:27:26.427 --> 01:27:28.227
- Okay.
- No.

01:27:37.871 --> 01:27:39.640
They can't do that.

01:27:40.841 --> 01:27:42.376
Can they, Elizabeth?

01:27:53.587 --> 01:27:56.222
Okay, Roxanol ever three
to six hours, remember?

01:27:56.289 --> 01:27:58.124
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

01:27:58.191 --> 01:28:00.193
- Depending on pain.
- Yes.

01:28:02.997 --> 01:28:06.066
Lucy, you're finally
on your feet again.

01:28:06.132 --> 01:28:08.134
You worked so hard.

01:28:08.201 --> 01:28:10.771
Are you 100% positive?

01:28:10.838 --> 01:28:12.006
I want to do this.

01:28:12.072 --> 01:28:13.474
It's the right thing to do.

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:16.209
Okay. Whatever you need.

01:28:17.378 --> 01:28:19.312
I really appreciate this.
Thank you.

01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:20.714
You got it.

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.267
Great. That's great.

01:28:42.903 --> 01:28:45.039
So glad this worked out
in the end.

01:28:45.105 --> 01:28:47.273
I really do think
it's for the best.

01:28:47.341 --> 01:28:48.676
Don't you?

01:28:53.981 --> 01:28:56.215
Yeah, you're doing
the right thing here, Luce.

01:28:56.282 --> 01:28:58.085
It's going to keep
Joe's legacy alive.

01:28:58.152 --> 01:28:59.853
You should feel good about it.

01:29:04.825 --> 01:29:06.292
There you go.

01:29:07.394 --> 01:29:08.729
Thank you.

01:29:13.667 --> 01:29:15.469
So?

01:29:15.536 --> 01:29:18.304
Well, you got
what you wanted, so...

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:20.474
go.

01:29:20.541 --> 01:29:22.208
Well, I mean, to be fair,

01:29:22.275 --> 01:29:25.612
I didn't get everything
I wanted, did I?

01:29:26.914 --> 01:29:28.115
Oh, you didn't?

01:29:28.182 --> 01:29:29.516
No.

01:29:31.351 --> 01:29:32.786
Hmm.

01:29:34.021 --> 01:29:35.321
Hmm.

01:29:38.826 --> 01:29:39.760
Holy shit.

01:29:39.827 --> 01:29:41.428
So sometimes, this thing jams.

01:29:41.495 --> 01:29:43.397
- But...
- Lucy.

01:29:43.464 --> 01:29:45.599
Sometimes it works.
You want to find out?

01:29:45.666 --> 01:29:48.168
He's made you nuts, hasn't he?

01:29:48.234 --> 01:29:50.471
I know.

01:29:55.375 --> 01:29:56.844
No problem.

01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:59.079
Got a meeting with Drew Davis
in an hour.

01:29:59.146 --> 01:30:00.313
Don't want to be late.

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:01.782
Tell her I said hi.

01:34:19.506 --> 01:34:20.741
<i>And for that,</i>

01:34:20.807 --> 01:34:23.243
<i>I am forever grateful.</i>

01:34:43.930 --> 01:34:45.665

<i>All my love, Harris.</i>

01:35:59.407 --> 01:36:01.274

- <i>Hey.</i>

01:36:01.342 --> 01:36:02.642

I really miss my old boss.</i>

01:36:12.652 --> 01:36:14.254
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:18.925
I found some work, actually.

01:36:19.826 --> 01:36:21.362
<i>Oh.</i>

01:36:21.429 --> 01:36:22.963
Yeah.

01:36:23.029 --> 01:36:27.100
How would you like to edit
some manuscripts with me?
