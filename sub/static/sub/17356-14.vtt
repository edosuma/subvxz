WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:08.340
- MAX: Previously
on "The Thundermans"--

00:08.342 --> 00:10.275
- I set a mega stink bomb
to go off

00:10.277 --> 00:11.243
during this year's Supe Awards.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.112
- We could transfer
Dark Mayhem's powers

00:13.114 --> 00:14.013
from the orb into one of us

00:14.015 --> 00:16.615
and then use his plasma balls
to destroy the stink bomb.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.984
Bye-bye evil powers.

00:18.986 --> 00:21.487
I can't put
Dark Mayhem's powers back.

00:21.489 --> 00:24.990
- ¶

00:29.430 --> 00:32.164
- ¶

00:32.166 --> 00:36.568
- DARK MAYHEM: [evil laughing]

00:43.110 --> 00:46.712
- [heavy breathing]

00:46.714 --> 00:50.616
I have to find a way to put
Dark Mayhem's powers back.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.418
[sighs]

00:52.420 --> 00:53.652
- ¶

00:53.654 --> 00:55.621
- Since we can't seem to agree
on where to go

00:55.623 --> 01:00.726
for our summer vacation,
it's time to play Zap the Map.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.629
Billy, spin your sister.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.065
- Why not just choose
names out of a hat?

01:06.067 --> 01:07.066
- Because it's more fun.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.468
Now twirl the girl!

01:11.272 --> 01:12.271
And zap.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.040
- [electronic zap]
- [crash]

01:15.342 --> 01:18.343
- It looks like
we're going to the lamp store.

01:18.345 --> 01:21.713
- Yeah! I hope
there's a waterslide.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.351
- Everything okay, Phoebe?

01:26.353 --> 01:27.086
- Yeah.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.053
Um, I just didn't sleep well.

01:28.055 --> 01:31.423
I'm gonna go make myself
a cup of evil--I mean, tea!

01:33.828 --> 01:35.494
- Well, wherever we go,

01:35.496 --> 01:40.165
I'll be using my new
state-of-the-art fishing pole.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.400
- Is that a toy?

01:41.402 --> 01:42.101
- A toy? [laughs]

01:42.103 --> 01:47.106
Chloe, this is the Gill Caster
600x with extendo action

01:47.108 --> 01:49.508
for professional
sport fishermen.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.243
Just hit this button.

01:51.245 --> 01:54.780
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:54.782 --> 01:55.647
- [laughing]

01:55.649 --> 01:58.250
That's a funny toy.

02:01.122 --> 02:04.189
- Max, I need your help.
- Sure, go ahead.

02:04.191 --> 02:04.890
- Okay, I've been--

02:04.892 --> 02:08.393
- La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.661
- Very funny. Are you done?

02:09.663 --> 02:13.532
- La, la, la, la, la, la.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.134
So now you need my help.

02:15.136 --> 02:18.337
Sure didn't need it to stop the
stink bomb at the Supe Awards.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.805
- I already said
I was sorry for that.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.840
But, please, I really
need you to listen here.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.175
I'm having terrible dreams,

02:23.177 --> 02:25.711
and I think it's because
I can't put--

02:27.815 --> 02:29.381
- Why did you do that?

02:29.383 --> 02:30.015
- I don't know.

02:30.017 --> 02:32.351
I think there's something
wrong with me.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.657
- Have you lost your mind?

02:38.659 --> 02:39.525
Colosso!

02:39.527 --> 02:41.793
Hair emergency!

02:43.797 --> 02:46.598
- ¶

02:46.600 --> 02:49.768
- There's only person who can
tell me how to stop this.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.672
- ¶

02:54.842 --> 03:00.279
- Well, we meet
again...Thunder Girl.

03:01.916 --> 03:02.714
- Dark Mayhem,

03:02.716 --> 03:06.351
I see you've been working
on your dramatic turns.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.421
- Yes, well, I've had
a lot of time to practice

03:09.423 --> 03:12.624
since you had me thrown
in SuperJail.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.561
- Strong Door here, too.

03:15.763 --> 03:20.766
- Ooooh, I begged them
to put me in solitary.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.204
Why have you come?

03:25.206 --> 03:27.472
To revel in my humiliation?

03:27.474 --> 03:31.443
- No! Well, that is kinda fun.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.712
I'm here because I borrowed
your powers from the orb

03:33.714 --> 03:34.813
and I can't put them back.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.349
- They're not just powers.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.684
They're evil powers.

03:38.686 --> 03:42.621
And now that evil is taking root
inside of you.

03:42.623 --> 03:45.357
- No, that's not possible,
I'm a superhero.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.392
I--I know I shouldn't
have come here.

03:47.394 --> 03:51.230
- Then I guess you don't
want to rule the world.

03:53.634 --> 03:54.800
- What are you talking about?

03:54.802 --> 03:57.402
- Strong Door also confused.

03:57.905 --> 04:03.342
- With my evil, you can
complete my masterplan.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.545
Everything you need is in a cave
at the bottom

04:06.547 --> 04:09.748
of the Weeping Volcano
in Hawaii.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.916
- Weeping Volcano?

04:10.918 --> 04:13.819
What am I saying?
Why am I even listening to you?

04:13.821 --> 04:14.953
- Don't fight it.

04:14.955 --> 04:19.291
Finish my work, and take
my vengeance on the hero world.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.293
- I don't want
to rule the world!

04:21.295 --> 04:22.394
- You do!

04:22.396 --> 04:23.895
I can see it in your eyes.

04:23.897 --> 04:24.663
- Stop talking.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.766
- It's just a matter of time,
Thunder Girl.

04:27.768 --> 04:32.304
Soon, you will be just like me.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.506
- I'll never be evil like you!

04:34.508 --> 04:38.810
- ¶

04:40.648 --> 04:43.415
- I'll be even more evil.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.351
- [grunting]

04:48.889 --> 04:52.324
- ¶

04:53.260 --> 04:55.694
- Well, after hours
of discussion,

04:55.696 --> 04:58.330
we finally agree on a vacation.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.265
The Thundermans are going to--

05:00.267 --> 05:02.968
- New York.
- Delaware.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.937
It's the state
that never sleeps.

05:08.709 --> 05:09.608
- Hey, Phoebe.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.376
I know you never
need me for anything,

05:11.378 --> 05:15.881
so I won't tell you
that red streak looks stupid.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.816
- It's just a streak,
it's not "evil."

05:17.818 --> 05:20.519
Why would you even say that?
Geesh.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.056
- First Dad hurts himself
with his fishing pole,

05:24.058 --> 05:26.491
and now Phoebe's acting weird.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.292
- What's your point?

05:27.294 --> 05:30.829
- No point, I'm just listing
stuff that happened today.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.366
- Psst, Chloe.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.671
How would you like to do a favor
for your favorite big sis?

05:39.673 --> 05:42.474
- What's Nora want?

05:42.476 --> 05:43.475
- I meant me.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.843
I need you
to come out to the driveway

05:44.845 --> 05:47.379
and teleport me to Hawaii,
then come right back home,

05:47.381 --> 05:49.514
keep it all a secret, okay?

05:49.516 --> 05:50.015
- Okay.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.919
Guys, I'm taking
Phoebe to Hawaii!

05:55.022 --> 05:55.587
- Chloe.

05:55.589 --> 05:59.624
- A family trip to Hawaii
sounds like a great idea.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.826
- [all agreeing]

06:00.828 --> 06:02.561
- No, that's a terrible idea.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.597
- Phoebe agrees, the Thundermans
are going to Hawaii.

06:05.599 --> 06:08.500
- [all cheering]

06:08.502 --> 06:12.537
- ¶

06:20.848 --> 06:22.547
- ¶

06:22.549 --> 06:25.951
- BILLY: Why didn't we have
Chloe teleport us to Hawaii?

06:25.953 --> 06:29.221
- CHLOE: Because
I'm on vacation, baby.

06:29.223 --> 06:32.557
- ¶

06:39.600 --> 06:43.668
- Look at the mountain.
- Aloha.

06:43.670 --> 06:44.536
- Thank you.

06:44.538 --> 06:48.006
Guys, can you believe
we're actually in Hawaii?

06:48.008 --> 06:50.709
- Uh, I am just glad
we are off the plane.

06:50.711 --> 06:51.610
I hate flying.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.078
- You're a flying superhero.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.547
- I know, but airplanes
are different.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.783
How do they stay up?

07:01.155 --> 07:01.753
- Wow.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.922
- Dad, go check in
so I can get to the beach

07:03.924 --> 07:07.259
and introduce the ladies
to these big kahunas.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.030
- Hey, nametag!

07:12.032 --> 07:15.167
Do you know where
the Weeping Volcano is?

07:15.169 --> 07:17.536
- No, sorry.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.671
- You will be sorry.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.040
- Whoa.
- [crash]

07:22.042 --> 07:26.511
- Phoebe, you still staring at
that map of Hawaiian volcanos?

07:26.513 --> 07:29.514
You had your nose buried in it
the entire flight.

07:29.516 --> 07:30.415
- Well, you know what they say.

07:30.417 --> 07:34.586
You don't really know a place
until you know its volcanos.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.287
- Nobody says that.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.890
- You know what they do say?
Shut your pineapple hole.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.192
- Well, we are all checked in.

07:40.194 --> 07:43.929
And I scored us tickets
for tonight's luau.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.831
- [all cheering]

07:45.833 --> 07:46.431
- What's a luau?

07:46.433 --> 07:49.134
- It's a big Hawaiian dinner
with hula dancers.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.836
- And fire twirlers.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.537
- And pork loin.

07:52.539 --> 07:54.639
Such much pork.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.174
- You're scaring me.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.243
- Come on, let's check out
the room.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.847
- ¶

08:10.190 --> 08:14.326
¶

08:14.928 --> 08:18.263
- Uh, this is the life,
hey, Barb?

08:18.265 --> 08:19.264
- Sure is.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.766
Hey, kids, how's that
sand castle coming?

08:21.768 --> 08:25.036
- Actually, we decided
to go a different way.

08:26.106 --> 08:30.108
- The weird part is,
that's not even my foot.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.578
- I'll fix that.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.617
- Now here's a sight they don't
mention in the travel books.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.818
Mount I wanna date ya,

08:39.820 --> 08:42.153
and Mount
please give me your numba.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.322
- [laughs]

08:45.125 --> 08:45.790
- Sorry, Max.

08:45.792 --> 08:50.795
The Gill Caster 600X
is a powerful machine.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.063
- Wait, don't go!

08:52.065 --> 08:55.767
I don't even know these people.

08:55.769 --> 08:56.201
Dad!

08:56.203 --> 08:59.771
- Max, this is supposed to be
a family vacation,

08:59.773 --> 09:02.741
so come over here
and flex for us.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.715
- There's waterfalls
on each side of this volcano.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.018
Found the Weeping Volcano.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.052
Time to go.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.921
- Oh, Phoebe, come.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.123
I'm gonna take a family selfie.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.859
- ¶

09:20.861 --> 09:21.459
- Oh, uh, aloha.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.296
Um, do you have anything that
could distract my entire family

09:24.298 --> 09:26.197
while I go wreak havoc?

09:26.199 --> 09:28.066
Oh, great, thank you.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.135
And nice fanny pack...

09:30.137 --> 09:33.071
said no one ever.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.674
- Everybody say "Thunder fam!"

09:35.676 --> 09:39.210
- ALL: Thunder fam!

09:39.212 --> 09:40.211
- Great, family.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.714
Anyway, I picked
up some brochures.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.283
There are so many
fun activities here.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.919
- Oh, look, there's an art class
at the craft huts

09:47.921 --> 09:49.154
starting in five minutes.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.221
- I wanna go there.

09:50.223 --> 09:54.426
- Of course you do,
because you're not an idiot.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.195
- Here's a brochure
for kite surfing.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.330
- That's kinda cool.
- I'm down.

09:58.332 --> 10:01.666
- Wait, wait, we're supposed
to be doing things as a family.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.835
- Yeah, well, Hank,
just let 'em go kite surfing,

10:03.837 --> 10:05.904
and we'll take Chloe
to the craft hut.

10:05.906 --> 10:06.504
- Alright, fine.

10:06.506 --> 10:09.975
But we are all gonna meet up
later at the luau for pork time.

10:09.977 --> 10:13.311
Family time.

10:13.313 --> 10:13.945
- Perfect.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.981
Now everyone has
a fun Hawaiian thing to do.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.950
Go do them. Bye.
- Wait.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.819
You can't just go off
by yourself.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.721
- Yeah, tell her, Dad.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.957
If I'm stuck with
our annoying family, so are you.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.259
- Max's horrible words
are right.

10:28.261 --> 10:32.263
You can either go with them
or come with us.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.131
- Fine.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.967
I guess I'm going kite surfing.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.236
- Let's go!

10:38.238 --> 10:41.139
- Wait, shouldn't we--
- Unbury Billy, yeah.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.743
- ¶

10:50.283 --> 10:52.984
- Okay, let's start with
the kite surfing lesson.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.719
Who wants to go first?

10:54.721 --> 10:55.320
How 'bout you?

10:55.322 --> 10:58.056
- How 'bout I hit you
with a coconut?

10:58.058 --> 10:58.757
- Huh?

10:58.759 --> 11:00.492
- I mean, Billy,
why don't you go?

11:00.494 --> 11:01.426
- I'm in!

11:01.428 --> 11:02.827
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.962
Where do you think you're going?

11:03.964 --> 11:05.096
You need to film me kite surfing

11:05.098 --> 11:07.899
so I can show every girl
on the island.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.735
- Both feet in the straps.

11:10.737 --> 11:11.202
Awesome.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.471
Now you're gonna grab this,
you're gonna hold on tight.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.839
- Time for an evil distraction.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.109
- Kite surfing is the safest
extreme activity in Hawaii

11:18.111 --> 11:20.779
as long as
you're properly trained.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.916
- I'm not properly trained!

11:24.918 --> 11:27.118
Ah!

11:27.120 --> 11:29.220
- ¶

11:29.222 --> 11:32.924
- The good news is it's almost
the end of shark season.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.793
Aloha!

11:34.795 --> 11:36.828
- ¶

11:36.830 --> 11:39.197
- BILLY: Ah!

11:39.199 --> 11:42.167
- That thing is dragging him
out to sea!

11:42.169 --> 11:44.202
- Phoebe,
we've got to help him.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.071
Where'd she go?

11:46.073 --> 11:47.205
- BILLY: Help!

11:47.207 --> 11:49.307
This is bad!

11:49.309 --> 11:50.909
Ah!

11:50.911 --> 11:53.011
- Use your telekinesis
to drag him back.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.345
- Okay.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.815
- ¶

11:56.817 --> 11:59.317
- Uh, my telekinesis
can't reach him.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.952
- BILLY: Ah!

12:00.954 --> 12:01.853
- Okay, there's no one looking.

12:01.855 --> 12:05.023
Nora, try to use your lasers
to cut him down from his kite,

12:05.025 --> 12:06.357
okay?
- Okay.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.793
- BILLY: Ah!

12:08.795 --> 12:11.896
- ¶

12:11.898 --> 12:12.864
- Nailed it!
- Nice saving.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.233
- BILLY: Help!
- From the kite, not the sharks.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.835
- Oh, come on.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.872
- ¶

12:25.545 --> 12:26.911
- Hey, Goggle Slinger.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.414
What's the fastest way
to the Holly Makalaka Volcano?

12:29.416 --> 12:31.182
- You must soar
with the hummingbird

12:31.184 --> 12:34.085
as he follows the rainbow
across the hibiscus--

12:34.087 --> 12:35.053
- Just tell me.

12:35.055 --> 12:38.089
- ATV, 100 bucks an hour.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.458
- Charge it to Hank Thunderman.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.962
- ¶

12:48.969 --> 12:50.535
- [coughing]

12:50.537 --> 12:52.237
- ¶

12:52.239 --> 12:55.140
- Are you okay, buddy?
- Yeah.

12:55.142 --> 12:55.907
I think so.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.409
Hold on, I have some
water in my ear.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.957
Much better.

13:12.959 --> 13:16.561
- Now to find Phoebe,
figure out what's going on.

13:16.563 --> 13:20.498
- ¶

13:20.500 --> 13:22.167
- Hey! Looking for a girl.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.401
Long hair, won't shut up
about volcanos.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.604
- Oh yeah, the girl who looked
like she wanted to hit me

13:26.606 --> 13:27.572
with a coconut.

13:27.574 --> 13:28.973
ATV, 100 bucks an hour.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.575
Follow the tracks.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.177
- Hundred bucks?

13:32.179 --> 13:33.344
What a rip-off.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.413
Charge it to Hank Thunderman.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.483
- ¶

13:38.485 --> 13:41.920
- [engine revs]

13:41.922 --> 13:45.657
- ¶

13:49.996 --> 13:53.398
- The ancient Hawaiians consider
some rocks to be sacred

13:53.400 --> 13:57.635
and thought harming them
would unleash terrible curses.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.637
- Oh, you hear that, Barb?

13:59.639 --> 14:00.305
- Ow.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.973
I'm about to unleash
some terrible curses

14:01.975 --> 14:05.109
if I break another nail
painting this rock.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.979
- Mommy, I'm finished
painting my rock.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.548
Look.

14:10.550 --> 14:14.219
- Oh no, Barb, she painted
on a sacred rock.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.320
We are gonna be cursed.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.922
- Oh, that's just
a superstition.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.190
- Here are your lunches.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.525
We were out
of peanut butter and jelly,

14:20.527 --> 14:24.162
so I brought you peanut butter
and jellyfish.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.067
- Ew.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.368
- The Gods are angry, Barb.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.402
- Gods aren't angry, Hank,

14:31.404 --> 14:33.671
but the hotel will be
if they see that rock.

14:33.673 --> 14:37.976
Now hurry, help me clean it off
before anyone sees it.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.981
- Ooh.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.216
Okay, here's--oooh!

14:45.218 --> 14:47.518
Oh!

14:49.022 --> 14:51.222
The curse.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.659
Go, go, go.

14:54.661 --> 15:00.231
- ¶

15:14.347 --> 15:19.484
¶

15:29.763 --> 15:31.396
¶

15:31.398 --> 15:33.298
- Stop following me, Max!

15:33.300 --> 15:36.267
- Don't make me
use powers, Phoebe!

15:36.269 --> 15:39.137
- Just leave me alone!

15:39.139 --> 15:42.040
- Whooo!

15:44.311 --> 15:45.643
- Look what you did.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.046
- I wouldn't have had to
if you'd just pull over.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.547
You left Billy
in danger back there.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.648
What's your problem lately?

15:50.650 --> 15:51.716
- Stop following me, Max,

15:51.718 --> 15:53.584
or I will show you
what danger really is.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.321
- See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.488
You've been acting
like an evil jerk

15:57.490 --> 16:00.058
ever since you used
Dark Mayhem's powers.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.660
- I'm warning you, Max.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.463
- You never gave them back.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.130
- Of course not.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.133
How else is a girl supposed
to take over the world?

16:09.135 --> 16:11.269
- ¶

16:11.271 --> 16:13.271
- [explosion]

16:13.273 --> 16:17.141

16:19.145 --> 16:21.612
- [engine revs]

- ¶

16:31.057 --> 16:33.791
- ¶

16:34.961 --> 16:37.161
- First I'm buried up to my head
in the sand.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.130
Then I almost drown
kite surfing.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.132
- You're just
listing things again?

16:41.134 --> 16:42.767
- Yep.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.369
- Guys, guys, guys, guys.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.804
Look, Phoebe
took Dark Mayhem's powers

16:46.806 --> 16:47.805
and got infected with his evil.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.340
We need to find Mom and Dad
right now.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.342
- They're at the crafts hut
with Chloe.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.110
- Let's go.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.779
Oh, and you're gonna need
a new ATV.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.249
Charge it to--
- Hank Thunderman, I know.

16:59.786 --> 17:03.187
- ¶

17:07.260 --> 17:10.228
- Hey. [clears throat]

17:10.230 --> 17:12.397
- ¶

17:12.399 --> 17:14.332
- Okay, we can
wash the rock off in there,

17:14.334 --> 17:17.201
but we gotta get these people
out first.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.037
Uh, excuse me, hi.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.006
My kid left
his electric eel in here.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.241
Has anybody seen it?

17:23.243 --> 17:25.276
- [laughs]
Good one, fella.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.079
[clicking]
Anyway--

17:28.081 --> 17:30.882
- [electric shock]
- Ah!

17:32.552 --> 17:34.519
- Sorry.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.487
Good job.

17:40.193 --> 17:43.394
- ¶

17:45.865 --> 17:47.231
- It's not working.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.000
Get some soap.
- Soap?

17:49.002 --> 17:52.003
Where am I supposed to find--oh.

17:52.005 --> 17:54.872
- ¶

18:00.246 --> 18:02.413
- Go crank up the jets.
- Right.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.415
- ¶

18:04.417 --> 18:05.383
- [Jacuzzi humming]

18:05.385 --> 18:07.085
- Sorry, Jacuzzi's closed.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.319
But here's 20 bucks.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.287
Buy yourself some lunch.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.857
And try the PB and jellyfish.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.093
How's it coming, Hank?

18:17.464 --> 18:19.530
Hank?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.500
- Barb?

18:22.502 --> 18:24.102
Where are you, Barb?

18:24.104 --> 18:28.306
Oh, oh, oh, oooh!

18:28.308 --> 18:29.974
- [screaming]

18:29.976 --> 18:33.277
- [crying loudly]

18:33.279 --> 18:36.447
- ¶

18:36.449 --> 18:39.517
- Great job.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.486
- Chloe, where's Mom and Dad?

18:41.488 --> 18:42.987
- Washing a rock.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.289
- Washing a rock?
Why are they washing a rock?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.191
- Because of the curse.

18:47.193 --> 18:49.327
Hello.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.229
- Okay, guys, we'll have
to stop Phoebe ourselves.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.931
But we need to get that orb
to extract her evil powers.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.368
Chloe, can you teleport home
to Hiddenville and get the orb?

18:57.370 --> 18:59.070
Oh, wait, you can't.

18:59.072 --> 19:01.038
It's hidden
in the secret weapons vault.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.540
- BOTH: In the fireplace.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.409
- How was I the last to know
about this thing?

19:05.411 --> 19:07.678
Alright, Chloe, go now.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.383
- You know, none of this
would've happened

19:12.385 --> 19:15.119
if we'd just gone to Delaware.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.022
- Here you go.
- Great.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.158
Alright, you two come with me
to the ATV.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.425
We'll follow
Phoebe's tire tracks.

19:21.427 --> 19:25.096
Chloe, go tell Mom and Dad
we went to save Phoebe.

19:25.098 --> 19:26.998
Let's go!

19:27.000 --> 19:31.435
- Do this, do that,
I'm trying to vacation here.

19:33.940 --> 19:39.110
- ¶

19:40.213 --> 19:43.247
- I searched this entire cave,
and there's nothing in here.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.583
I can't believe Dark Mayhem
scammed me.

19:45.585 --> 19:50.521
- ¶

19:50.523 --> 19:53.257
- Then that happened.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.626
- Greetings!
- Ahhh!

19:55.628 --> 20:00.198
- I am Destructo.

20:00.200 --> 20:00.665
Nothing?

20:00.667 --> 20:04.235
Oh, that's what I get
for being a sidekick.

20:04.237 --> 20:07.138
- Wait, you're
Dark Mayhem's sidekick?

20:07.140 --> 20:07.805
Where's your body?

20:07.807 --> 20:11.275
- Dark Mayhem was afraid
I was too powerful,

20:11.277 --> 20:13.010
so he never attached it.

20:13.012 --> 20:16.380
Which stinks, because it had
armor plates and rocket feet

20:16.382 --> 20:19.684
and molecular turbo drives,
hand blasters.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.751
Oh, a bottle opener.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.087
- Hey, your body was cool,
I get it!

20:23.089 --> 20:26.624
Look, Dark Mayhem sent me here
to finish his masterplan.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.358
- Really?

20:27.360 --> 20:32.296
Then you know about
his secret supply of Malvexium.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.030
- Malvexium?

20:33.032 --> 20:36.200
You mean the only element that
can destroy a hero's powers?

20:36.202 --> 20:38.169
- No, the diaper crème.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.404
Yes, that Malvexium.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.407
He was going to use the volcano
to spread Malvexium

20:43.409 --> 20:45.676
throughout
the Earth's atmosphere.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.645
- Leaving every superhero
and supervillain

20:47.647 --> 20:48.579
in the world powerless.

20:48.581 --> 20:52.116
- Except himself, because
he'd be safe in his escape pod

20:52.118 --> 20:53.584
flying high above the Earth.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.786
- And he'd return
and be the only one with powers,

20:55.788 --> 20:57.255
allowing him
to take over the world.

20:57.257 --> 21:00.057
- Can't I possibly
finish a sentence!

21:00.059 --> 21:04.428
Now everything we need is in
Dark Mayhem's volcano lair.

21:04.430 --> 21:08.132
All you have to do
is get me there.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.568
- Ah! Spider!

21:12.305 --> 21:16.607
I probably could have
handled that better.

21:16.609 --> 21:20.044
- ¶

21:22.749 --> 21:24.382
- Okay. The rock is clean.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.285
All we have to do is put it
back in its sacred spot

21:27.287 --> 21:29.086
and the curse will be lifted.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.354
- What are you doing with that?

21:30.356 --> 21:33.124
- Oh, how'd this rock get here?

21:33.126 --> 21:35.092
- Hank.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.494
Hank, it's over.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.629
- Look, sir, we're very sorry.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.364
Our daughter painted
on that sacred rock,

21:40.366 --> 21:43.367
and we were trying to fix it
before anyone noticed.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.369
- But the curse was too strong.

21:45.371 --> 21:50.775
Will the Gods never be appeased?

21:50.777 --> 21:53.544
- Relax, man,
that's not a sacred rock.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.545
- Wait, it's not?

21:54.547 --> 21:56.814
- No, that's a piece
of petrified whale vomit

21:56.816 --> 21:59.250
I sit next to
while I eat my lunch.

21:59.252 --> 21:59.750
- Uh.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.786
What about all the ancient
Hawaiian markings?

22:01.788 --> 22:04.655
- I chisel cooky little faces
on it while I eat.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.424
Then I usually take a dip
in the hot tub,

22:06.426 --> 22:09.660
but I heard some jerk
put an electric eel in it.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.295
- [laughing]

22:11.297 --> 22:14.131
- [laughs] That's so crazy.

22:14.133 --> 22:14.899
- You think that's crazy.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.768
Some other guest is racking up
a $1,000 ATV bill.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.705
- [laughs] Hate to be that guy.

22:20.707 --> 22:23.708
- [laughs]

22:23.710 --> 22:25.543
- You shouldn't
have come here, Max.

22:25.545 --> 22:26.210
- I had to.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.412
You need my help to defeat
Dark Mayhem's evil.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.680
- It's my evil now.

22:29.682 --> 22:33.417
And it's stronger
than yours ever was.

22:33.419 --> 22:34.652
- Give it up, Phoebe.

22:34.654 --> 22:38.189
Your evil days are over.

22:38.191 --> 22:38.889
- The orb.

22:38.891 --> 22:39.890
Max, put that down.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.892
- This is for your own good.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.430
- [grunting]

22:46.432 --> 22:48.432
- ¶

22:48.434 --> 22:49.767
- No, Phoebe!

22:49.769 --> 22:52.436
That orb's your only chance.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.638
- I guess I'm out of chances.

22:58.311 --> 23:01.779

Destructo.

23:01.781 --> 23:05.583
I've got a world to take over.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.385
- Nice to meet you guys.

23:07.387 --> 23:11.856
[evil laughing]

23:11.858 --> 23:14.258

23:42.455 --> 23:43.587

23:43.589 --> 23:47.458

to have some hope.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.392
- Good news, guys.

23:48.394 --> 23:49.460
I heard people talking.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.095
Maybe they can help us escape.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.196
[echoes] Escape, escape.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.998
- It's called an echo, Billy.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.065
You heard us.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.034
[echoes] Us.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.602
- They're they are again!

23:58.604 --> 24:01.172
- We have to get out of here
and help Phoebe.

24:01.174 --> 24:02.173
- Help throw her in jail.

24:02.175 --> 24:04.175
It's because of her
we're trapped in here

24:04.177 --> 24:05.609
and the world is in danger.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.311
- Don't blame, Phoebe.

24:07.313 --> 24:08.612
Blame Dark Mayhem's evil.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.447
- It's the same thing now.

24:09.449 --> 24:13.617
And it's gonna stay that way
since Phoebe destroyed the orb.

24:14.587 --> 24:15.686
- It's true.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.322
She's Evil B now.

24:19.392 --> 24:20.691
Everyone's calling her that.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.227
- No, they're not.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.496
- Guys, we can't
give up on her.

24:25.498 --> 24:26.197
When I was evil,

24:26.199 --> 24:28.966
Phoebe was the one
who helped me become good.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.267
Now it's my time to help her.

24:30.269 --> 24:33.471
- It's nice that you won't
give up on, Evil B.

24:33.473 --> 24:37.041
I will keep saying it
until it catches on.

24:38.711 --> 24:44.148
- ¶

24:44.150 --> 24:45.382
- Crisis averted.

24:45.384 --> 24:48.953
And to think, our vacation
was almost ruined by a curse.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.321
- There was no curse, Hank.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.691
Just a local weirdo
who chisels whale vomit.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.259
Hi, sweetie.

24:55.261 --> 24:55.960
Where are the kids?

24:55.962 --> 24:57.628
They should be back
from kite surfing by now.

24:57.630 --> 25:00.397
- Oh yeah, they went
to go find Phoebe.

25:00.399 --> 25:01.131
- Find Phoebe?

25:01.133 --> 25:03.133
- She has Dark Mayhem's powers.

25:03.135 --> 25:03.734
- BOTH: What?

25:03.736 --> 25:07.404
- It's okay.
I got Max the orb.

25:07.406 --> 25:08.072
- The orb?

25:08.074 --> 25:11.141
- How long were we scrubbing
whale barf?

25:11.143 --> 25:12.209
- I don't know
what's going on,

25:12.211 --> 25:14.011
but if Phoebe's using
Dark Mayhem's powers,

25:14.013 --> 25:16.480
she and the kids could be
in serious danger.

25:16.482 --> 25:18.082
- We have to help the kids.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.050
But what are we gonna do
about Chloe?

25:20.052 --> 25:21.519
- I wanna hula.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.554
- ¶

25:23.556 --> 25:25.322
- Come on.

25:25.324 --> 25:29.260
Excuse me, is there room
for one more in Kids Club?

25:29.262 --> 25:29.827
- Of course.

25:29.829 --> 25:33.397
Come on, Kiki, let us show you
the ancient art of hula.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.566
- Does hula mean free?

25:35.568 --> 25:38.569
- Hank, Chloe's safe and happy,
now what do we do?

25:38.571 --> 25:39.703
- The only thing
we can do, Barb.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.439
Ask the luau guy to hold
our place in the pork line

25:42.441 --> 25:45.142
while we save our children.

25:45.144 --> 25:49.013

25:56.489 --> 25:59.023

No annoying brothers,
no annoying bunnies.

26:02.595 --> 26:03.661
- Ow!

26:03.663 --> 26:04.295
Watch it!

26:04.297 --> 26:06.697
Is this the first time
you've held an android head?

26:06.699 --> 26:08.499
- I'm sorry. Is this better?

26:08.501 --> 26:09.567
- [crash]
- Ooh!

26:09.569 --> 26:14.338
Can you please just
reconnect me to my body?

26:14.340 --> 26:17.174
It's over there.

26:17.176 --> 26:21.679
- ¶

26:21.681 --> 26:22.613
- Okay, I will.

26:22.615 --> 26:25.316
After the volcano spreads
Malvexium throughout the world,

26:25.318 --> 26:28.652
rendering every superhero
powerless.

26:28.654 --> 26:30.821
- You sound just Dark Mayhem.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.756
After I build a volcano lair.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.758
After I get the Malvexium.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.494
I want my body!

26:37.797 --> 26:40.698
- You're done?
Can I take over the world now?

26:41.367 --> 26:44.134
- With that outfit, you can try.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.770
- I don't need fashion advice
from a talking nightlight.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.173
- I'm just saying,
you're standing right next

26:49.175 --> 26:52.376

27:07.593 --> 27:11.762
- Oh, I am so keeping this
for Evil Prom.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.398
- Now, we just have
to lower the Malvexium

27:14.400 --> 27:15.232
into the boiling lava,

27:15.234 --> 27:20.104
set the volcano to blow,
and fly off in the escape pod.

27:20.106 --> 27:20.738
- Boiling lava?

27:20.740 --> 27:22.206
I don't see any boiling lava.

27:22.208 --> 27:25.175
- Flip that lever.

27:25.177 --> 27:25.809
- This one?

27:25.811 --> 27:29.847
- No, that's
our hot dog rotisserie!

27:32.284 --> 27:35.786
I'm talking about
the lever on the wall.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.554
- Oh, that one.

27:37.556 --> 27:38.722
Just point next time.

27:38.724 --> 27:41.458
Oh right, you can't.

27:54.740 --> 27:57.241
You're about to meet
your new ruler.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.276
- And her best friend Destructo.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.512

28:16.228 --> 28:18.696
- No, that's why I said ow.

28:20.399 --> 28:23.167
- It's no use, we're never
getting out of here.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.568
We'll probably starve.

28:24.570 --> 28:25.736
- Not if I can help it.

28:25.738 --> 28:30.374
Who's up for a PB and jellyfish?

28:30.376 --> 28:31.375

28:31.377 --> 28:35.312
- I know, I don't like
peanut butter either.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.414

28:48.394 --> 28:50.227
I'm kind of an expert
at tracking people.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.762

28:51.764 --> 28:54.331
in Billy's right molar
when he was five.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.867
- That's why that tooth
is green.

28:56.869 --> 29:00.571
- Now what is this about Phoebe
having Dark Mayhem's powers?

29:00.573 --> 29:02.940
- She and some weird
android head are planning to use

29:02.942 --> 29:06.243
the volcano to spread Malvexium
throughout the world?

29:06.245 --> 29:06.910
- Malvexium?

29:06.912 --> 29:07.711
How did this happen?

29:07.713 --> 29:10.714
- I'll explain on the way, but
we have to stop her, come on.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.649

29:12.651 --> 29:17.921

open it!

into the lava.

But don't touch it.

29:38.778 --> 29:41.478
Even the slightest contact
with your skin will--

Malvexium's in place,

I love my motherboard.

30:31.597 --> 30:32.396
