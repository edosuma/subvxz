WEBVTT

00:29.738 --> 00:30.822
[crack]

00:30.905 --> 00:32.782
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

00:32.866 --> 00:36.119
Oh, is that...?
Going to take care of it.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.502
I need this so bad.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.671
You don't know how far I came.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.923
If I can close my eyes, I can...

00:49.007 --> 00:50.759
Oh, really?

00:50.842 --> 00:53.803
Yeah, honey.
Yeah, honey... yeah...

00:53.887 --> 00:55.472
[groaning]

00:55.555 --> 00:58.183
[sighs] Oh, we fucking came together.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.730
[sizzling and gurgling]

01:03.813 --> 01:06.816
[roaring]

01:06.900 --> 01:08.610
And that's pretty much how it happened.

01:08.693 --> 01:12.113
So, life started because a giant alien
had sex with the Earth?

01:12.197 --> 01:14.365
I don't know.
That sounds like Scientology.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.659
Yup, of everyone they got the closest.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.696
As you know, the science fair next week
is a chance to embrace

01:53.780 --> 01:55.698
the true spirit of experimentation.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.951
- Science fair buddies again?
- You want an A.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.787
- I'm fine with a C.
- And we'll end up with a B.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.288
What-- what's this?
What are we doing now?

02:02.372 --> 02:03.998
- We're doing a fist bump.
- Ah.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.418
Because the football program has taken
part of our budget for legal fees,

02:07.502 --> 02:09.504
this year we'll be breaking up
into teams of three.

02:09.587 --> 02:11.339
[voice echoing]

02:14.259 --> 02:16.970
Devin is mine!

02:17.053 --> 02:19.305
[screaming]

02:20.390 --> 02:21.808
Guys, over here!

02:21.891 --> 02:23.560
I don't think we can work with Jessi.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.062
Yeah, it will be impossible to spend
all that time with her

02:26.146 --> 02:27.438
and not tell her what we saw.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.233
That we saw her mom
lez out with another woman?

02:30.316 --> 02:32.527
I put it in our spank bank.
It's all digital now.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.155
Hand down. You're with me, Glazer.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.282
We just need a third.
Like an idiot to make fun of.

02:37.365 --> 02:40.201
Okay. So, who were you thinking?
Ooh, the Go-Gurt burglar?

02:40.285 --> 02:44.080
- [giggles]
- No, his geisha giggle weirds me out.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.208
I was thinking...
[gasps] male Frida.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.961
- Andrew! Nick! Guys, over here!
- Oh, Jay?

02:50.044 --> 02:52.422
- Oh, I don't know.
- He's perfect.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.008
He's ridiculous,
and he's kind of cute, right?

02:55.091 --> 02:56.968
- Eww. No.
- Oh, come on.

02:57.051 --> 03:00.430
He's like a sexy Neanderthal.
Jay! Get over here!

03:00.513 --> 03:02.765
- You're on our team.
- Fuck yes! Ha ha!

03:02.849 --> 03:06.019
Chosen! Hey, Nick, Andrew,
I'm joining Matthew's team.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.646
We're gonna bury you fags.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.814
That's what I'm talking about.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.275
Oh, shit, Jessi and Jay are both taken.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.192
- Oh.
- [screaming]

03:13.276 --> 03:14.903
That's it, Missy. She's really smart.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.280
- Missy, do you want to be our partner?
- Whoa! Really?

03:17.363 --> 03:19.908
- Oh, yeah, I like that.
- I can't work with Missy.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.870
Come on, do a little work, kissy-kissy,
ride her aboard, humpy-humpy.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.372
No, no, no, no!
She makes me very nervous.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.918
I get all dizzy, and I don't know
if I'm gonna barf or cum in my pants.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.669
Either way, it's sweet release.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.588
- Hi, Andrew.
- Hi, Missy. I want--

03:33.671 --> 03:35.131
- [muffled retch]
- [gulps]

03:35.215 --> 03:37.008
- Welcome to the team.
- Thanks.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.218
I really can't wait to--

03:38.301 --> 03:39.344
- [muffled retch]
- [gulps]

03:39.427 --> 03:40.929
Oh. That was a little vomit,

03:41.012 --> 03:44.307
and I think it happened
because I am truly excited

03:44.390 --> 03:47.810
to join you in this odyssey
of inquiry and exploration.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.772
Stay away from Devin.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.440
- [groans]
- [giggles]

03:53.149 --> 03:56.986
Anyway, as far as water coolers go,
you see that new  Seinfeld  yesterday?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.696
That show has been off the air for years.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.492
Yeah, well, there was a new one
on WGN last night.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.537
Kramer, you know, the cool one,
he ordered a coffee that was so hot,

04:06.621 --> 04:10.166
he's gonna sue the place, you know,
which I thought was extreme, but...

04:10.250 --> 04:11.834
Yeah, uh, okay.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.921
Anyway, speaking of coffee,
I'm a Sanka man.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.214
I'm a Keurig lady.

04:16.297 --> 04:19.175
Whoa! Is there banter happening here?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.844
Miss Benitez weighs in with the Keurig.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.388
That's a tough word to say.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.223
Well, you could just say K-cups.

04:25.306 --> 04:29.978
Uh-oh! She said it again!
Saying stuff directly to me! K-cups!

04:30.061 --> 04:33.439
That's for Keur-- Keurig. Courage.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.066
You give me courage.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.734
Oh, thanks, Steve.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.112
I'm looking for some help
with the science fair.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.698
Okay, I'll do it, AKA sign me up,

04:41.781 --> 04:45.702
AKA I am not able to sign myself up,
AKA I cannot read.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.412
Well, maybe I can help you with that.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.205
Well, that would be--
[muffled retch]

04:49.289 --> 04:50.540
Are you okay, Steve?

04:50.623 --> 04:54.919
[gulps] Am I okay?
Nobody has ever asked me that before.

04:55.003 --> 04:58.798
You know what? Spoiler alert, I am
gonna help you with that science fair,

04:58.881 --> 05:00.508
but it's not gonna be "science fair."

05:00.591 --> 05:03.970
Spoiler alert,
it's gonna be "science awesome."

05:04.053 --> 05:05.430
That's so funny, Steve.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.183
Sorry about that.
That's the Sanka coming back up.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.436
You're the man, Steve.

05:11.519 --> 05:14.439
No,  you're  the man,
my Hormone Monster dude.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.774
Are you gonna eat that vomit?

05:18.192 --> 05:21.946
Okay. For our project, I'm thinking
we do the science of three pointers.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.449
Andrew and I will shoot hoops,
and, Missy, you can do the math.

05:24.532 --> 05:28.369
Oh, boy, look at her going to town
on that hummus and celery.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.579
Two can play at that game.

05:29.662 --> 05:33.416
Suck down a couple of those loose scallops
that Daddy packed for you.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.044
No, gross.
I will not eat in front of her.

05:36.127 --> 05:39.338
- It's too embarrassing.
- May I propose a project?

05:39.422 --> 05:41.966
What if we made a model
of the Yellowstone Caldera?

05:42.050 --> 05:45.553
It's a super volcano, and when it blows,
the ash cloud will destroy farmland,

05:45.636 --> 05:48.389
- clog rivers and suffocate entire cities.
- That sounds devastating.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.141
I'll send you some really troubling links.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.101
I'd like that. I'd like that very much.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.145
Okay, we've got two solid options,

05:54.228 --> 05:56.481
super volcano or shooting threes.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.399
Those in favor of super volcano?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.777
- Uh, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.696
Two betas beat one alpha,
good to know.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.867
All right, dum-dums, I don't even know
if you can handle the idea that I've got.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.495
[gasps] Jessi, can we handle it?

06:10.578 --> 06:13.414
I'm wearing a second pair of underwear.
Let's do this.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.375
Good call, 'cause I'm about
to shit  your  pants.

06:16.459 --> 06:20.379
Our project is about the magic
of teleportation.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.842
First off,
confusing science and magic... mmwah!

06:24.926 --> 06:26.803
But we have a big problem.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.514
Jessi and I are too scared
to lead the presentation.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.058
I could do it. I could do it.
[stammers] Jay will do it.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.684
Oh, thank goodness.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.729
And I was thinking we should just wear,
like, our regular boring clothes, right?

06:36.813 --> 06:39.273
Oh, my God. What are you, crazy?

06:39.357 --> 06:42.443
Matthew and I will be wearing
matching vests and shiny shirts.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.696
And Jessi will be wearing
a tight little skirt-- ooh.

06:45.780 --> 06:49.325
Unless you wanna wear the skirt, Matthew,
but I think gay and trans are different?

06:49.408 --> 06:52.537
No, no, they are the same
and you should tell people that.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.122
- I will.
- This is fun.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.707
But if we don't have an actual project,
we're gonna get an F.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.585
Oh, Marnie. Shout-out to  Girls.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.588
Relax, our project
is right in front of us.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.091
We're gonna make a science documentary.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.093
- [pigeon cooing]
- The Delusion of Illusion:

07:07.176 --> 07:10.096
The Lonely World of a Child Magician.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.391
So, you and Missy, huh?

07:14.142 --> 07:15.268
What about me and Missy?

07:15.351 --> 07:17.603
Ah, come on,
you wanna slam-dunk her pussy.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.106
- Jesus.
- Come on, Andrew. You obviously like her.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.732
I don't like her. I just--

07:21.816 --> 07:24.777
I just think about her all the time
and my ears get hot--

07:24.861 --> 07:28.239
Yeah, and your dick gets hot too.
Oh, maybe it's got a fever.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.241
Stick a thermometer in its little mouth.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.034
Ugh! That sounds so painful.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.453
You like her. You should ask her out.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.289
I'm definitely not doing that.
What if she says no?

07:36.372 --> 07:37.457
Dude, she'll say yes.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.169
That's even worse, Nick,
'cause then we'll date,

07:41.252 --> 07:43.754
and I'll tell her all my secrets,
and then we'll break up,

07:43.838 --> 07:45.673
and she'll tell everyone else my secrets,

07:45.756 --> 07:46.924
and then the whole school will know

07:47.008 --> 07:48.968
about these milk baths
my mom gives me for eczema.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.137
- Andrew, may I be blunt?
- But, of course.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.973
Opportunities like this might be
somewhat rare for you.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.267
What are you saying?
That most of the time I'm gonna like girls

07:56.350 --> 07:58.895
and they won't like me back
so I should seize this opportunity?

07:58.978 --> 08:01.230
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Yes, Andrew, seize the day,

08:01.314 --> 08:02.773
and here's how you're gonna do it.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.902
Okay. So here's the key.
Missy is at the baseline.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.196
You're gonna pass it down to her.
That's asking her out.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.323
She's gonna do a spin move.
That's her saying yes,

08:10.406 --> 08:13.367
- and then that's a dick.
- Wow, I didn't see that coming.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.786
Oh, you wanna see it coming?
Yeah, give me a sec.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.998
[message alert chime]

08:22.210 --> 08:23.044
Huh?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.963
Andrew, what are you doing here?

08:26.047 --> 08:28.382
- It's nearly 9:00.
- I couldn't sleep.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.967
Me, neither.
I don't know about you,

08:30.051 --> 08:32.887
but I was thinking about the Caldera
and how we need to savor every moment

08:32.970 --> 08:35.431
before life is ripped from us
by a storm of airborne ejecta.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.642
Ejecta? Oh, she wants it.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.353
- You should take out your penis.
- Oh, Christ, please, just let me do this.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.605
- Okay, well, I'll take out my penis.
- Shh, shh!

08:42.688 --> 08:45.191
Missy, I think that you're
a very cool person

08:45.274 --> 08:47.026
whom I enjoy spending time with.

08:47.109 --> 08:50.029
- You think that?
- I do, and I wanted to ask you

08:50.112 --> 08:54.242
if it's not a bother currently,
if perhaps you would be my girlfriend?

08:54.325 --> 08:55.743
[muffled scream]

08:55.826 --> 08:58.829
- Does that mean yes?
- Yes, I would like that very much.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.832
- [rumbling]
- Oh, boy. Did you feel that?

09:01.916 --> 09:03.251
Do you think it was an earthquake?

09:03.334 --> 09:06.045

All right. There we go, bro,
you've got a girlfriend.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.241
I've got a girlfriend. I can't breathe.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.410
- I think I'm hyperventilating.
- Here, breathe into this.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.703

10:37.762 --> 10:39.055
That is a song.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.015
Oh, Miss B, you're so nice.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.517
You're not trying to steal
one of my kidneys, are you?

10:43.601 --> 10:45.353
'Cause I've been fooled multiple times.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.438
[chuckles] No, you remind me
of my brother.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.190
He's special, like you.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.650
You think I'm special?

10:50.733 --> 10:53.486
You're the man, Steve.
Give her a kidney.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.490
Hey, Miss B, how do you spell "love"?

10:58.115 --> 11:01.661
- L-O-V-E.
- Mm-hmm. Uh-huh... oh.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.870
- Love.
- Ah!

11:02.953 --> 11:04.914
Hockey stick, coffee stain,

11:04.997 --> 11:06.957
water cooler cup, sideways comb.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.043
You're learning really quickly. I love it.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.962
And I love you. I'm in love with you.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.340
Oh, Steve, that's very sweet.

11:14.423 --> 11:17.468
- I love you too.
- And I love pizza.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.303
Cowabunga, dude.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.138
[class bell ringing]

11:23.432 --> 11:25.267
Hey, buddy, uh,
what the hell are you doing?

11:25.351 --> 11:28.020
I'm having a panic attack,
Nick, currently.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.399
I'm looking at Missy, and it feels like
my heart is leaping out of my chest.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.402
Andrew, as your doctor,
I would advise you get your shit together

11:34.485 --> 11:37.196
- and go talk to your girlfriend.
- Oh, God, that word.

11:37.279 --> 11:40.449
Oh, my tongue is getting larger.
Can you just talk to her for me?

11:40.533 --> 11:42.076
Jesus, come on.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.955
Missy, Andrew is back from the floor.
He says good morning.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.289
[muffled] Good morning, Andrew.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.292
I seem to be suffering from a classic case
of swollen tongue. [chuckles]

11:51.293 --> 11:54.922
I was wondering if you would like
to go to the science museum tonight

11:55.005 --> 11:56.924
with me and my parents.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.468
Andrew, your girlfriend
just asked you out on a date.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.178
- What do you say?
- [muffled] Say yes.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.682
Sorry about that. I had one of my dicks
in my mouth. Say yes.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.226
[muffled] Weren't we supposed
to watch volcano movies tonight?

12:07.309 --> 12:10.896
- It's fine. Missy, he would love to.
- [swoons]

12:10.980 --> 12:13.399
Okay. Now, I can't believe
I'm  saying this,

12:13.482 --> 12:15.693
but can we please focus
on our science project?

12:15.776 --> 12:18.404
[sniffs] You know, I'm smelling this.
This isn't my dick.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.825
Oh, I do not feel good.
I am really nervous about this date.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.452
You know what always relaxes you?

12:24.535 --> 12:25.828
No, no, I don't know.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.415
This is our first chance to jerk off
to something that might actually happen.

12:29.498 --> 12:32.877
- Let's glaze those knuckles, honey.
- Okay. Maybe you're right.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.339
[seagulls cawing]

12:37.423 --> 12:40.259
Hi, Andrew,
what do you want to do to me?

12:40.342 --> 12:44.054
Uh... I wanna put sunscreen
on your body.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.347
Yeah, lube her up!

12:47.349 --> 12:48.601
Now what?

12:48.684 --> 12:51.812
You want to lie down with me
like when people lie down?

12:51.896 --> 12:55.691
But you just put on sunscreen
and the sand might stick to you.

12:55.774 --> 12:58.027
Hey, Gilligan.
What the fuck are we doing here?

12:58.777 --> 13:00.779
- Give it to me, Andrew.
- Uh...

13:00.863 --> 13:02.490
Nope, this doesn't feel right.
Can't do it!

13:03.032 --> 13:04.700
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.411
Now that she's my girlfriend,
it feels wrong.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.747
Like, I don't want
to sully our relationship.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.458
All right, fine.
Let's just, uh, get back to basics.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.418
Ah, here's the Athleta catalog.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.171
I got a tub of Land O'Lakes,
which is dual purpose.

13:17.254 --> 13:20.508
Okay. No, no,
I can't use any of that stuff.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.552
If I masturbate to someone else,
I'll feel like I'm cheating on Missy.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.762
So let me get this straight.

13:24.845 --> 13:28.599
You can't jerk off to Missy
and you can't jerk off to not Missy.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.893
- What the hell are you gonna jerk off to?
- Nothing.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.895
I guess I'm not gonna jerk off.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.647
[breathless laugh]

13:34.730 --> 13:36.565
Yeah, you're-- you're not gonna jerk off.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.943
All right, where are the cameras?
[chuckles]

13:39.026 --> 13:40.819
Am I on  Jerk'd ? [laughs]

13:40.903 --> 13:43.364
- Where's Mark McGrath?
- Hey, I'm serious.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.158
I am not masturbating
from this day forward.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.828
And if you'll excuse me, I have
to get ready for my date with Missy.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.206
But you haven't jerked off
in nearly 36 hours.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.332
[beeping]

13:53.415 --> 13:56.919
That's unprecedented. If you don't do it
soon, you're gonna blow, damn it!

13:58.504 --> 13:59.838
How do you like that?

13:59.922 --> 14:01.757
Andrew Glouberman has a girlfriend.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.593
I'll never forget my first love.
Becky Lyman.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.680
I kissed her on the cheek,
and she kicked me square in the groin.

14:07.763 --> 14:11.392
But you know what hurt even more
than my swollen, bruised testicles?

14:11.475 --> 14:13.519
- Your heart?
- No, my urethra.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.896
It collapsed and had to be
surgically repaired.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.315
But I'm sure things will go
much more smoothly for Andrew.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.318
That boy is gonna be
a beautiful boyfriend.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.821
Guys, can we please
stop talking about Andrew?

14:23.904 --> 14:25.114
Oh, Nicky.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.365
Are you jealous?

14:26.448 --> 14:29.201
No, I've just been talking
about Andrew and Missy all week.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.288
And now he's out with her,
and I'm on a date with my parents.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.707
Hey, this is the only threesome
I'd ever want.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.500
- Gross.
- What we're saying is,

14:36.584 --> 14:39.003
we'd go out with you
even if you weren't our son.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.088
You'd go out with a random
12-year old boy?

14:41.171 --> 14:43.591
If he was as dynamite as you,
you better believe it.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.802
Holy bonkers!

14:46.886 --> 14:48.512
This is a real trifecta for me.

14:48.596 --> 14:52.933
Hanging out with my parents,
science, and my beau.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.435
Oh, am I talking too much?

14:54.518 --> 14:58.898
Cyrus, you let her have dried papaya,
and now she's bouncing off the walls.

14:58.981 --> 15:02.443
I didn't give her any papaya.
I think she's sweet on someone else.

15:02.526 --> 15:05.279
- He's talking about Andrew.
- Yes.

15:05.362 --> 15:09.241
My mom says I'm sweet
and that's why spiders keep biting me.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.576
Oh, smooth.

15:10.659 --> 15:13.412
Way to bring up your mom
and also spider bites.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.498
You sure you don't wanna tell them
about your pediatric hemorrhoids?

15:16.582 --> 15:19.376
- Are you drunk?
- Andrew, are you coming?

15:19.460 --> 15:22.379
Oh, in the heart, with you, alone?

15:22.463 --> 15:24.048
- Yes.
- I'm coming, too.

15:24.131 --> 15:27.092
No, you cannot be in there.
You need to leave me alone.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.679
Not a chance, homo.
I'm gonna watch you turn her out.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.723
Hey, this is not okay.

15:32.806 --> 15:37.102
Now, I didn't wanna have to do this,
but I am thinking about my grandmother.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.104
Gray, round, and ready to pound.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.649
[groans] Okay.
How about a mezuzah?

15:41.732 --> 15:44.360
- Huh?
- You know how a cross works on a vampire?

15:44.443 --> 15:46.987
Oh, sweetheart,
a mezuzah is just a gold dick

15:47.071 --> 15:50.115
you nail on your door to say,
"Inside, we fuck."

15:50.199 --> 15:52.284
Okay. You leave me no choice.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.911
This is Garrison Keillor,

15:53.994 --> 15:56.789
the former host of NPR's
A Prairie Home Companion.

15:56.872 --> 16:00.876
A lovely thing about Christmas
is it's compulsory.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.254
- Feel his sexlessness!
- No, no, no! Aaah!

16:04.338 --> 16:05.714
Come on, Missy. Let's go.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.301
Now I will breathe loudly
through my nose hair.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.679
- My dicks! My dicks are running away!
- [squeaking]

16:13.263 --> 16:17.101
I'm so glad you're taping this
because these guys are legends.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.853
I give you...
the Sorcerers of the Square Table.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.691
Come near. The closer you look,
the less you see, ha ha!

16:23.774 --> 16:25.651
Okay. We're changing the project.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.154
"How no sex for 30 years
affects the male posture."

16:29.238 --> 16:31.281
Ooh, get a close-up
of Mr. Bolo Tie's fingernails.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.201
Look how long they are.
They're like antlers.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.579
Okay. First of all,
"Mr. Bolo Tie" has a name,

16:37.663 --> 16:39.665
and it's the Magnificent Gary.

16:39.748 --> 16:43.460
And his long fingernails
are because he uses a harp in his act.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.714
Uh-huh. Because magic
isn't lame enough on its own.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.759
Oh, my God, I feel like I'm my most
authentic self with you, Matthew.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.804
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
Are you guys making fun of magic?

16:53.887 --> 16:55.889
- And you.
- And your man coven.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.392
I don't get it.
Why did you even choose me?

16:58.475 --> 17:00.811
- What about our project?
- Oh, come on, Jay.

17:00.894 --> 17:04.314
We can't seriously do a science project
about teleportation.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.150
Darling, it's not even real.

17:06.233 --> 17:10.362
Teleportation is the exact place
where science and magic intersect.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.323
I can't believe I brought you assholes
into this sacred space!

17:13.407 --> 17:17.536
- It's a Panera.
- It's a chamber of wonders, you dicks!

17:18.370 --> 17:20.873
- Are you still getting this?
- It's gold.

17:20.956 --> 17:22.249
Do either of you have a car?

17:22.332 --> 17:25.127
I'm 30 minutes late for a court-supervised
visit with my mother.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.628
[piano music playing]

17:26.712 --> 17:29.298
- Hey, Duke.
- Hey! It's Friday night!

17:29.381 --> 17:30.883
Where's your accountant Andrew?

17:30.966 --> 17:32.801
- Oh, we're just friends.
- Uh-oh!

17:32.885 --> 17:35.304
It's not good to have your friends
do your taxes.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.223
Andrew's got a date.
I set him up with this girl Missy, and...

17:38.307 --> 17:39.641
now, she's all he talks about.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.101
Oh!

17:41.185 --> 17:42.227
And you're feeling left out?

17:42.311 --> 17:44.730
I'm just kind of worried
he's not gonna have time for me anymore.

17:44.813 --> 17:48.567
Oh, he won't.
Some men just disappear into their ladies,

17:48.650 --> 17:51.987
like Joltin' Joe DiMaggio
with Marilyn Monroe.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.906
He was obsessed,

17:53.989 --> 17:57.951
just hanging out in center field,
folding her panties up.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.370
♪ And not her nice panties ♪

18:00.454 --> 18:03.415
♪ Her "I'm feeling sick today" panties ♪

18:03.499 --> 18:05.334
Uh-huh. I mean, I like girls too,

18:05.417 --> 18:08.045
but I make time for my family,
sports, my friends.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.046
Me, too.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.882
And my girl, my cars, my band.

18:11.965 --> 18:12.966
Yeah, we're the same.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.928
That's right.
Two ghosts alone in the attic.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.387
But I'm not dead.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.349
You are to Andrew. [chortles]

18:20.432 --> 18:22.184
- [heartbeat]
- Whoa.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.520
This is a lovely ventricle.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.230
Yes, it looks very healthy.

18:26.313 --> 18:29.191
- No signs of plaque or...
- Or arterial blockage.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.735
You took the diagnosis
right out of my mouth.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.321
It's really nice being alone with you.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.532
- [pounding]
- Let me in!

18:36.615 --> 18:39.535
Andrew, let me in! I will not be ignored!

18:39.618 --> 18:41.662
It's nice to be alone with you too, Missy.

18:41.745 --> 18:45.791
I will burn this place to the ground
and fuck the ashes!

18:45.874 --> 18:49.211
I have been blowing loads
since the dawn of time!

18:49.294 --> 18:50.295
- [rumbling]
- Oh!

18:50.379 --> 18:52.381
Missy, Andrew, are you kids okay?

18:52.464 --> 18:53.465
Was that real?

18:53.549 --> 18:56.135
Don't you worry.
It was just a tremor, sweetie.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.512
That was me!
I'm taking credit like ISIS!

18:58.595 --> 19:01.348
You asshole!
You just ruined my first kiss!

19:01.431 --> 19:03.725
No,  you  just ruined your first kiss.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.353
I warned you.
Now look what you made me do.

19:06.436 --> 19:07.938
Oh, God, no!

19:08.021 --> 19:11.984
Cats are intended to teach us that
not everything in nature has a purpose.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.528
There's only one way to make you shut up!

19:15.404 --> 19:17.447
- Oh, God.
- Garrison, no!

19:17.531 --> 19:20.284
Take it all, Keillor. Take it all.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.080
Oh, thank you. Oh!

19:25.164 --> 19:27.749
Steve. Look at you all dressed up.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.169
- Well, it's a special day.
- And you're a special guy.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.213
- And I would kill anyone for you.
- Well, that's not necessary.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.508
Well, that's a relief 'cause I'd do it,
but it would weigh on me.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.845
Hey, would you want to be
an honorary judge for the science fair?

19:39.928 --> 19:40.929
- A judge?
- Yeah.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.849
At the science fair?
I would be honorary.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.017
That makes me so happy.

19:45.100 --> 19:49.354
Well, I think I'm about to make you
a little bit happier.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.231
- [grunting]
- Oh, Steve.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.859
That's right.
I know you knew this was coming.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.278
Miss B, will you marry me?

19:56.361 --> 19:58.030
Oh, Steve.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.032
I'm so flattered. Really.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.992
But I can't marry you.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.620
- What? Why?
- Well, for one,

20:04.703 --> 20:07.915
don't you think you should marry someone
a little more like you?

20:07.998 --> 20:10.083
Someone who pays their taxes in grapes?

20:10.167 --> 20:11.501
Kind of, yeah.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.213
But, also, Steve, I think of you
more as a friend.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.215
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.841
How dare you say sorry

20:17.925 --> 20:20.719
when you just made me
the happiest man of my life.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.804
- You're happy?
- Of course.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.348
You want to be friends.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.892
I can't believe you're putting me
in the friend zone.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.435
That's like the number one zone.

20:28.518 --> 20:31.939
Yes, Steve.
I would be honorary to be your friend.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.690
Who's the man?

20:33.774 --> 20:37.402
Spoiler alert, it's Steve, AKA "the man."

20:37.486 --> 20:39.738
[beeping]

20:40.405 --> 20:42.407
That was intense at the museum.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.159
Oh, the earthquake, I mean.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.496
- Yeah, it was. Oh, crap, no.
- [clears throat]

20:47.579 --> 20:49.414
- Hello, Brother Andrew.
- Brother Andrew?

20:49.498 --> 20:52.125
Yes. I want to apologize for my behavior.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.919
I may have crossed the line

20:54.002 --> 20:57.881
when I skull-intercoursed
Mr. Keillor's severed head.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.717
And you should know
that I won't be bothering you anymore.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.053
Oh. Okay, I-- I guess that's good.

21:03.136 --> 21:06.932
- God bless you, Brother Maurice.
- And God bless you, Pastor Rick.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.393
There's the man who got me clean.
Helped me find the Lord.

21:09.476 --> 21:14.106
Uh-oh! There seems to be some, uh,
pre-lava oozing out of the volcano.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.024
[exhales] I'm gonna go to the parking lot

21:16.108 --> 21:18.527
and smoke a quick Merit,
get my head straight.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.780
- [groans] He looks really sad.
- I know.

21:21.863 --> 21:26.118
I don't want to make fun of him. There's
a ton of mold on those shower curtains.

21:26.201 --> 21:28.203
Oh, my God.
Is he talking to his bath mat?

21:28.287 --> 21:31.039
I don't need them. I can do this myself.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.958
Then why'd you even bring me from home?

21:33.041 --> 21:35.335
Because they ditched me
and I need something to teleport.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.921
You said we could go
to the Cheesecake Factory.

21:38.005 --> 21:40.215
I want avocado egg rolls.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.092
What do you think
about the mouth, Andrew?

21:42.175 --> 21:44.428
- Is it moist enough?
- It's plenty moist, Missy.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.679
- Hey, sorry, I'm late.
- Oh.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.931
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Oh, good.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.600
Missy keeps saying all this stuff
that sounds so sexual.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.978
- Right, yeah, Missy. Great, of course.
- What?

21:53.061 --> 21:54.980
- You're such a girlfriend guy.
- What do you mean?

21:55.063 --> 21:57.816
Next thing you know, you're gonna be
folding her underpants in center field.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.276
That's crazy.

21:59.359 --> 22:02.112
I can't imagine myself
being placed in center field.

22:02.195 --> 22:05.449
- I'm more of a right field kind of guy.
- Well, you're clearly too busy for me.

22:05.532 --> 22:09.119
- Just spending all your time with Missy.
- Missy and I just started dating.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.495
Why are you freaking out so much?

22:10.579 --> 22:12.622
I'm not freaking out!
You're being a shitty friend!

22:12.706 --> 22:14.374
You're  being a shitty friend!

22:15.417 --> 22:17.002
[beeping]

22:18.503 --> 22:21.131
This would work a lot better
if I had an assistant, but since I don't,

22:21.214 --> 22:25.469
ladies and gentlemen,
I will be teleporting this bath mat.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.679
It's not gonna work, you butt-fuck.

22:27.763 --> 22:31.016
Why don't you teleport
your head out of your ass?

22:31.099 --> 22:31.933
Okay, okay.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.685
Assistants are better seen, not heard.

22:33.769 --> 22:38.648
Now, as you can see,
the booth is empty, as is this booth.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.317
Wha-- what are you guys doing here?

22:40.400 --> 22:42.194
We thought you might need
a couple assistants.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.863
And we didn't want to be blamed
for your suicide.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.115
Okay. Let's do this.

22:47.199 --> 22:51.661
Ladies and gentlemen, behold,
the science of teleportation.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.246
[electricity crackling]

22:54.331 --> 22:56.291
Holy shit. It worked.

22:56.374 --> 22:57.667
Jay, we did it!

22:57.751 --> 22:59.878
No, Jessi. I did it.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.338
Still the worst.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.924
Our project is the Yellowstone Caldera,

23:04.007 --> 23:07.761
a sleeping giant ready to awaken
at any moment.

23:07.844 --> 23:11.014
Hot, thick fluids bubbling up from below.

23:11.098 --> 23:15.685
Swelling, thrusting, crustal stretching.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.813
I can't. I can't keep it together, man.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.607
I'm not strong enough. I'm really sorry.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.567
- Sorry for what?
- For what I'm about to do.

23:22.651 --> 23:25.987
And when the pressure builds,
it needs to release.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.197
- [rumbling]
- Oh, my God! Whoa!

23:29.116 --> 23:31.618
Everything's fine, kids.
It's just a small tremor.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.912
Okay. Everybody keep your friends close.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.539
Keep going, Missy. You're doing great.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.499
I... I can't. I...

23:37.582 --> 23:39.501
Andrew, can you please take over?

23:39.584 --> 23:41.795
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

23:41.878 --> 23:42.963
Uh...

23:43.046 --> 23:44.965
- My...
- Oh, boy.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.591
- [groans]
- [rumbling]

23:46.675 --> 23:48.802
- Whoa!
- Oh, God!

23:48.885 --> 23:49.970
Shit!

23:50.053 --> 23:51.513
Missy, come with me.

23:51.596 --> 23:54.307
No, you're out of control, Andrew!

23:55.058 --> 23:56.476
We're all out of control.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.812
Suck my stump, Maurice.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.605
Yeah, suck his sick little dick.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.941
All right. I don't know what's going on.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.776
- [metal clanging]
- Fuck!

24:04.860 --> 24:09.072
Do you take Coach Steve to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

24:09.156 --> 24:09.990
I do.

24:10.073 --> 24:11.783
Hallelujah!

24:11.867 --> 24:14.035
- [cracking]
- [electricity crackling]

24:14.119 --> 24:15.287
Oh, my God!

24:15.370 --> 24:16.872
[children screaming]

24:16.955 --> 24:18.039
Missy! Whaah!

24:18.790 --> 24:19.708
[squeaking]

24:19.791 --> 24:20.792
Oh, you like it? Bad girl.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.840
Andrew, you knucklehead.

24:26.923 --> 24:29.050
...are also intended to teach us...

24:30.135 --> 24:33.138
And there will be a day of reckoning,

24:33.221 --> 24:35.515
as the hot lava blasts forth...

24:35.599 --> 24:38.393
[voice changing]
and cleanses the Earth of sin,

24:38.476 --> 24:42.147
for you cannot control
the power of nature.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.816
[cackling]

24:47.402 --> 24:48.236
[gasps]

24:49.487 --> 24:51.990
No!

24:52.991 --> 24:54.618
Shit!

24:54.701 --> 24:55.869
[gasps]

24:57.078 --> 24:58.997
Ugh! It's everywhere.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.041
- [squishing]
- It's between my goddamn toes.

25:01.124 --> 25:04.211
I told you the volcano would blow.
You can't ignore me. I'm here to stay.

25:04.294 --> 25:07.339
- Like Nick Cannon.
- So it was all a wet dream?

25:07.422 --> 25:08.965
I honestly don't know.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.134
I think the Jessi and Jay stuff was real.

25:11.218 --> 25:15.222
- What about the bath mat?
- She's real, and she's spectacular.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.890
Hey, that's from  Seinfeld.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.559
- Question: am I still dreaming?
- I think so.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.519
Okay, 'cause I wasn't
in the teacher's lounge

25:21.603 --> 25:23.688
when Coach Steve was,
like, talking about  Seinfeld.

25:23.772 --> 25:24.731
Right, right, right.

25:24.814 --> 25:29.402
Let's just agree that maybe I've seen all
of this and that this dream is possible.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.571
What did you think
about the Garrison Keillor part? Too far?

25:31.655 --> 25:33.490
That part made me uncomfortable.

25:33.573 --> 25:35.242
Yeah, at the time, it seemed funny.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.118
No, and I like fucked up stuff like that.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.496
- You know, Netflix insisted on it.
- Really?

25:39.579 --> 25:43.500
[The Notorious B.I.G. "Juicy" playing]
