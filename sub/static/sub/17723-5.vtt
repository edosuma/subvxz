WEBVTT

00:18.551 --> 00:20.152
WOMAN:
Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:21.453
(indistinct chatter)

00:21.455 --> 00:22.488
Ooh, oh-ho-ho!

00:22.490 --> 00:23.522
What are we celebrating?

00:23.524 --> 00:26.158
Well, Dan's stepdaughter
just made varsity golf.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.794
Oh, my gosh, yay,
that's so great!

00:28.796 --> 00:31.030
Who's Dan?

00:31.032 --> 00:33.866
(whispering): I think
he's Hawaiian shirt guy.

00:33.868 --> 00:34.967
Oh, Hawaiian shirt.

00:34.969 --> 00:37.503
What a fresh take on fun.
Yeah.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.305
Hey, why is it every time we get
the smallest bit of good news,

00:40.307 --> 00:42.141
you insist on having a party?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.209
Well, here's a reason.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.345
Uh, I never get to have
a birthday party.

00:46.347 --> 00:46.912
Why not?

00:46.914 --> 00:48.147
When's my birthday?

00:48.149 --> 00:51.784
September 11th... Oh!

00:54.854 --> 00:58.357
Terrorists stole my special day.

00:58.359 --> 01:01.093
Hey, Warner, these
are great cold cuts.

01:01.761 --> 01:02.761
David, did I ever tell you

01:02.763 --> 01:05.230
my idea for "warm cuts"?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.666
Well, they're just
like cold cuts, except...

01:07.668 --> 01:10.069
See? You get it.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.039
All right, guys,
to honor this occasion,

01:14.041 --> 01:17.076
I would like
to pleasure you orally.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.713
With a fine cigar.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.015
Oh.
Mmm.
Oh!

01:23.017 --> 01:25.250
Uh, do not light those.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.085
Why not?

01:26.087 --> 01:27.119
I don't like the smell.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.120
Why, does it remind you

01:28.122 --> 01:30.789
of the men
you used to dance for?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.327
You look like
a tough cartoon baby.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.697
Besides, you shouldn't
be smoking today.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.600
for the company insurance
policy tomorrow.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.701
Oh, I don't want

01:42.703 --> 01:45.704
to do the physicals, come on!

01:45.706 --> 01:47.206
I'm fine, he's fine.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.574
We're fine, we're all fine.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.043
Yeah, we're all fine,
everybody's fine.

01:51.045 --> 01:53.112
Will you just cover
for us for a little bit?
Where are you going?

01:53.114 --> 01:54.713
We're gonna go upstairs
and smoke these.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.582
Well, you can't just leave.
It's the middle of a workday.

01:56.584 --> 02:00.385
Could we leave if there was
a death in the family?

02:00.387 --> 02:01.887
Well, yeah.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.222
All of our aunts just died.

02:06.392 --> 02:09.728
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

02:09.730 --> 02:11.563
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:11.565 --> 02:15.767
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

02:15.769 --> 02:17.803
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

02:17.805 --> 02:21.907
¶ So many stars up in the sky

02:21.909 --> 02:26.345
¶ So many questions have I

02:26.347 --> 02:28.447
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:28.449 --> 02:31.316
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.488
(all coughing, hacking)

02:40.260 --> 02:43.562
Now this is how
successful men celebrate.

02:44.764 --> 02:47.366
What we celebrating?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.936
Oh, our, uh-uh,
coworker's stepdaughter

02:50.938 --> 02:52.871
made the varsity team today.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.806
Well, my nephew
crawl to America

02:54.808 --> 02:57.576
in a sewer pipe today.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.180
Welcome
to <i>Estados Unidos,</i> Miguel.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.448
ALL:
Miguel!

03:06.887 --> 03:11.356
five of these a day
down at the Pan Am board room.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.225
Then they realized
when the smoke cleared,

03:13.227 --> 03:15.894
I didn't work there.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.362
That sounds like
a lot of smoking.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.964
When was your last physical?

03:18.966 --> 03:20.299
Oh, let me see.

03:20.301 --> 03:23.902
Well, Warner, when was
that-that AIDS craze?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.904
Dad, again,

03:25.906 --> 03:28.140
AIDS was not a "craze."
Okay.

03:28.142 --> 03:29.975
All right, it was
no hula hoop,

03:29.977 --> 03:32.744
but it got people talking.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.013
Hey, maybe you guys should come
with us when we get physicals.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.815
I don't need a doctor.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.983
The leading cause of death

03:37.985 --> 03:41.486
in our family is Nazis.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.590
Yeah, we don't
need doctors, okay?

03:44.592 --> 03:45.557
Everybody's fine.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.828
Well, you're really scared
of the doctor, aren't you?

03:49.830 --> 03:52.664
They have skeletons in the room.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.266
Don't worry, Mr. Warner.

03:54.268 --> 03:58.570
Skeletons only come
alive at night.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.674
Let's go get
our speed bags squeezed

04:02.676 --> 04:04.977
by some old Jewish dude.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.781
Your temperature is...

04:09.783 --> 04:11.416
98.6.
98.6?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.918
Oh, my gosh, we're
already finishing

04:12.920 --> 04:16.455
I feel really good about
what's happening here.

04:17.357 --> 04:20.359
Okay, I'm just gonna
put this in your mouth.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.661
Now you're stealing my lines.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.199
All right, Warner,
I'm gonna listen to your heart.

04:27.201 --> 04:28.433
Okay, okay, I have to warn you,

04:28.435 --> 04:30.569
I'm-I'm-I'm pretty ticklish.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.971
(laughing)

04:32.973 --> 04:35.374
I'm sorry. Okay, okay...

04:35.376 --> 04:37.242
I can't listen when you laugh.
I know, I know, sorry.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.610
Okay, you can do it.
Okay, I'm ready.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.746
I'm ready, okay, yeah, okay.
Ready? Okay?

04:40.748 --> 04:43.915
(laughing)

04:43.917 --> 04:45.484
Oh, my God! Okay.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.152
I should just do it myself.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.220
Yeah.
Okay.

04:48.222 --> 04:49.621
Okay.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.889
Okay, Warner, you can do this.

04:50.891 --> 04:51.890
Don't laugh, don't laugh.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.660
Dead kittens, dead kittens,
dead kittens.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.828
Okay, I'm ready.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.397
(laughing)

04:58.399 --> 05:01.733
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.403
Actually I had one that lasted
more than four hours,

05:04.405 --> 05:06.004
and I almost called you.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.806
Hearing or vision loss?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.776
No, sore wrist.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.678
So, any questions?

05:12.680 --> 05:15.614
Have you seen the movie,
<i>Tin Cup?</i>

05:15.616 --> 05:16.415
No.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.816
Then I have no questions.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.254
I have your results, which I'd
like to read to all of you.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.255
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

05:23.257 --> 05:27.759
What about doctor-patient
confidentiality?

05:27.761 --> 05:29.795
Eh.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.930
David and
Crawford,

05:31.932 --> 05:33.532
I have bad news.

05:33.534 --> 05:37.769
I'm afraid your sons
are in terrible shape.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.105
What?!

05:40.107 --> 05:43.942
I hate it here.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.012
Crawford and David, whatever
you're doing, keep doing it.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.647
Hmm.
H-He eats food

05:48.649 --> 05:50.449
off the ground
after parades.

05:50.451 --> 05:54.453
People get excited.
They drop things.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.955
You two need to take a page
from your fathers' books.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.523
You have the same genetics.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.992
Just do what they do
and come and see me in a week.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.328
Oh, wait, sorry.
Next week?

06:03.330 --> 06:05.364
Isn't there a way
to just sign the insurance form

06:05.366 --> 06:09.134
and then we can...
(mutters indistinctly)

06:09.136 --> 06:10.402
I can't do that.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.304
It goes against
my professional integrity.

06:12.306 --> 06:13.238
Ah, okay.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.474
Doctor, can I take
these pills

06:15.476 --> 06:18.043
I found here
in the cushions?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.578
Sure.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.914
But don't drink on those.
Wink, wink.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.157
So, let me get this straight.
Your dads passed the physical

06:32.159 --> 06:33.658
and you two did not?

06:33.660 --> 06:38.930
Well, it's not like a course
that you can take pass-fail.

06:38.932 --> 06:39.898
So then how'd you do?

06:39.900 --> 06:40.966
We failed.

06:41.934 --> 06:43.602
I-I don't get it.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.404
All I do is work out,
drink water

06:45.406 --> 06:48.507
and eat women's
energy bars.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.709
Now I got to take health tips
from my dad.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.512
I know. And all they do
is sleep, drink
and go to the bathroom.

06:53.514 --> 06:56.214
They're like drunk babies.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.682
Morning.

06:57.684 --> 06:58.617
Dad, it's 4:00
in the afternoon.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.453
Ah, well, then it's
time for a cocktail.

07:01.455 --> 07:04.689
Guys, we don't have alcohol
in the office.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.391
Hmm. What do you
have at your house?

07:06.393 --> 07:07.626
Beer. What do you got?

07:07.628 --> 07:11.596
Gin, scotch, rye,
bourbon and tequila.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.366
Can I go to Crawford's house?

07:14.368 --> 07:17.135
All right.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.504
Mwah!
(groans)

07:21.407 --> 07:23.308
Wait a minute. You know what?

07:23.310 --> 07:25.577
That's exactly
what we should be doing.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.078
What do you mean?
Kissing each other on the mouth?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.414
No.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.049
No. No, no. We should be doing
what they do.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.718
The doctor said that
they're healthier than we are.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.720
Oh. I know
that's what the doctor said,

07:35.722 --> 07:38.089
but I don't want to take lessons
from my dad.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.624
Lesson one:

07:39.626 --> 07:44.162
what you put in your body
in no way affects your health.

07:44.164 --> 07:47.732
Dad, you are always complaining
about stomach pain.

07:47.734 --> 07:53.438
Stomach pain is a way to tell
you that your body is working.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.408
I stuff myself with
Chinese food, I feel terrible,

07:56.410 --> 07:59.077
I know I'm healthy.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.981
all the time and then you're
in the bathroom all day.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.318
How much time are you spending
on the can every day?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.019
I don't know.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.690
You don't know?

08:12.425 --> 08:13.758
Dad, I have to work.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.694
I can't spend all day
in the bathroom.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.996
Yes, you can.
If people aren't enraged

08:17.998 --> 08:19.698
with how long
you've been in there,

08:19.700 --> 08:22.434
you weren't in there
long enough.

08:22.436 --> 08:24.803
How do I know when's it okay
to come out?

08:24.805 --> 08:28.006
When you leave that bathroom
shaking like a newborn deer,

08:28.008 --> 08:29.875
you're done.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.678
All right, Warner,
now that you've had

08:33.680 --> 08:35.881
your first hammock
brandy, how do you feel?

08:35.883 --> 08:37.716
I feel
like a dizzy millionaire.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.618
(chuckles)
Excellent.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.553
Now we should put
something in our stomachs.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.155
And I want you to write
this next part down.
Okay.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.624
Look at this,

08:45.626 --> 08:48.793
wheat germ,
Greek yogurt,

08:48.795 --> 08:50.295
skim milk.

08:50.297 --> 08:55.667
These are the things that are
blocking my dessert wine.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.202
Do you ever eat food?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.370
Of course.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.338
My diet is 70% schnitzel,

09:00.340 --> 09:02.707
20% food court teriyakis

09:02.709 --> 09:06.545
and, at the top
of the pyramid, fudge.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.246
How are you still alive?

09:08.248 --> 09:10.649
Ah. The fudge attracts
the germs,

09:10.651 --> 09:13.084
the alcohol sterilizes them

09:13.086 --> 09:15.987
and then the fat escorts them
out the back door

09:15.989 --> 09:18.390
in a jellied mess.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.824
You know what?

09:19.826 --> 09:21.760
We're talking about this,

09:21.762 --> 09:26.031
and we're not even having
a conversation beer.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.066
Okay, so you're just
always drunk.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.501
Hey, remember,

09:29.503 --> 09:32.938
you're never drunk
if you're always drunk. Hmm?

09:34.874 --> 09:37.709
Lesson two...

09:37.711 --> 09:41.179
How is just sitting here,
watching TV good for you?

09:41.181 --> 09:43.415
I'm not just watching TV.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.750
I scream at it.

09:47.019 --> 09:50.121
That's my cardio.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.357
Here. Turn
to any channel.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.593
(clears throat)

09:54.595 --> 09:58.964
I'm not buying insurance
from any reptile!

10:00.433 --> 10:03.435
Get out of that hurricane,
Anderson Cooper,

10:03.437 --> 10:06.271
you fake hero!

10:07.607 --> 10:09.374
Hey, Simon Cowell,

10:09.376 --> 10:11.343
get a bra!

10:13.145 --> 10:16.815
Okay. You try.

10:16.817 --> 10:21.353
Uh, you should've not shaved
that mustache, Alex Trebek...

10:26.092 --> 10:28.560
I thought you were serious
about this.

10:28.562 --> 10:30.228
Come on, mean it.
Sorry.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.865
Die, Oprah!

10:34.600 --> 10:37.736
Too far. Try again.
Too far.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.672
(salsa music playing)
That's not dancing!

10:40.674 --> 10:43.041
Those aren't stars!

10:45.244 --> 10:46.778
There you go.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.313
That does feel better.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.648
Sure does.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.583
And remember, with cardio,

10:51.585 --> 10:53.485
anyone can be yelled at.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.520
Hey, Edna!
Put that Chinese food

10:55.522 --> 11:00.125
in the freezer
before it gets rotten!

11:00.127 --> 11:01.793
I'm not a slave!

11:01.795 --> 11:03.294
You put in yourself,

11:03.296 --> 11:07.365
you... (speaking Spanish)!

11:07.367 --> 11:08.700
And she yells back,

11:08.702 --> 11:12.003
so we're both exercising.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.740
She just burned off a churro.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.644
Okay.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.946
Good workout, Mr. David.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.248
Ooh!

11:34.827 --> 11:36.494
Um, where have you been?

11:36.496 --> 11:37.829
Work started
two hours ago.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.531
There was a free pancake
breakfast

11:39.533 --> 11:42.467
at Saint Mary the Blessed Heart.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.668
You're Jewish.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.471
Yeah, but who can tell?

11:46.473 --> 11:48.673
Everyone.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.508
Here, take a look at these
landscapes

11:50.510 --> 11:51.976
for <i>Tropic of Murder.</i>

11:51.978 --> 11:54.179
Oh, those are terrible colors.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.247
No, too many volcanoes.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.949
Those trees are stupid.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.888
Oh, my God, I think
I'm leaking syrup.

12:17.703 --> 12:20.004
I really hope I'm leaking syrup.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.509
So, everything good?

12:24.511 --> 12:25.677
Very good.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.912
You and Eli turned
this around in a week.

12:27.914 --> 12:28.747
Great.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.914
Speaking of
turning around...

12:29.916 --> 12:30.715
Huh?

12:30.717 --> 12:34.252
I need to do
a prostate exam.

12:44.396 --> 12:47.699
Oh... yeah...

12:47.701 --> 12:50.869
Yeah, I'm not good at that.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.704
No, maybe I can e-mail you
a picture.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.439
(both speaking indistinctly)

12:54.441 --> 12:56.474
Just relax,
come on.
No, I...

12:56.476 --> 12:58.743
No, I don't want...
I don't want to.
Just relax, come on.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.579
Just relax, relax.
Okay.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.716
Okay, okay, but, uh,
just be gentle, okay?

13:04.718 --> 13:07.719
I-I've never had anything...
(gasps)

13:07.721 --> 13:10.121
Oh, my God!

13:34.747 --> 13:36.748
(exhales)

13:36.750 --> 13:38.983
(breathing heavily)

14:20.492 --> 14:22.594
Almost done?

14:28.701 --> 14:32.537
Uh, Doctor, you're,
you're really thorough.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.474
Doc?

14:37.877 --> 14:40.845
(screams)

14:40.847 --> 14:42.981
What happened?

14:42.983 --> 14:45.383
Oh, my God, Doctor.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.453
He's dead.

15:06.372 --> 15:10.208
Well, at least he died
in the line of duty.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.310
(Warner gasping)

15:20.786 --> 15:21.753
What do you mean
he's dead?!

15:21.755 --> 15:24.522
He was just
giving me an exam!

15:24.524 --> 15:27.091
Yeah, he still is.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.661
Well, g-get him out of there.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.463
I can't.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.932
Eli, Eli, get in there.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.337
Let go.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.114
I can't.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.818
He's right, it's an
involuntary reflex.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.954
It's called a
peristaltic contraction.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.221
Is that normal?

15:57.223 --> 15:59.290
Not at all.

16:00.659 --> 16:01.960
Well, can't you
give him something?

16:01.962 --> 16:03.394
Only the doctor
can do that.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.564
Well, he's with a patient
right now.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.900
I'll go get some help.

16:08.902 --> 16:11.135
Okay.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.750
Eli, are you
still here?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.819
Yeah, still here, buddy.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.188
How long is this gonna take?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.756
Well, it took 'em
60 days

16:31.758 --> 16:34.659
to get those coal miners
out in Peru.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.998
We may need to drill
a second hole.

16:43.802 --> 16:46.104
Oh, boy.

16:48.507 --> 16:52.777
Did, uh, did you guys
try pulling it out?

16:52.779 --> 16:55.680
Uh, yeah,
we tried pulling it out.

16:55.682 --> 16:59.050
That's the first thing we tried!

16:59.785 --> 17:01.719
Well, I can't do it.

17:01.721 --> 17:06.090
The equipment for this kind
of thing is in New Orleans.

17:09.128 --> 17:13.364
How do you not have this
equipment in San Francisco?

17:19.705 --> 17:22.540
(knocking)

17:22.542 --> 17:26.411
Oh, my God, Warner,
baby, are you okay?

17:26.413 --> 17:27.178
No.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.646
EMT:
Wait a minute.

17:28.648 --> 17:29.814
Warner?

17:29.816 --> 17:31.716
Warner Whittemore?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.017
Yeah.

17:33.019 --> 17:37.088
Rob Davies, 11th grade, man,
Model U.N.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.689
Oh, what's up, Rob?

17:38.691 --> 17:41.559
Man.
Yeah... yeah.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.727
Wait a minute.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.995
Rob Davies?

17:43.997 --> 17:45.596
Camila.
Yeah.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.565
Oh, my God.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.399
(chuckles)

17:48.401 --> 17:49.700
Ooh-- wait,
you guys are married?

17:49.702 --> 17:51.736
Yeah, we got two kids now.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.703
Ooh.
I know.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.839
Warner, you are
a lucky guy.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.008
Great to see you.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.743
Come here, girl.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.744
Oh, thank you.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.746
Oh, God, your hair
smells the same.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.714
Oh, stop.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.516
(Warner murmurs)

18:05.518 --> 18:08.519
Excuse me, I, I kind of have
a little situation over here.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.588
(knocking)

18:12.891 --> 18:15.726
Whoa.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.129
Hands Across America.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.233
You know what?
I've got an idea.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.601
You know
those Chinese finger traps

18:23.603 --> 18:26.471
where you have to push in
to pull out?

18:26.473 --> 18:28.906
Let me try something here, okay?
No, no, no, no, no.

18:28.908 --> 18:32.110
(screams)

18:49.461 --> 18:51.829
I no clean that.

18:57.903 --> 19:02.240
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost,

19:02.242 --> 19:04.509
let us all say "Amen."

19:04.511 --> 19:06.844
ALL:
Amen.

19:08.747 --> 19:11.082
You're going to be fine.

19:11.084 --> 19:14.585
We see a lot of this
at the church.

19:14.587 --> 19:18.422
Oh, my God, Howard!

19:18.424 --> 19:21.592
(sobbing)

19:21.594 --> 19:26.397
I begged him to retire,
but he was so into his work.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.335
Did he suffer?

19:32.037 --> 19:35.206
Did <i>he</i> suffer?

19:36.708 --> 19:41.712
May I just have a moment alone
with my husband?

19:42.648 --> 19:45.750
Oh, ok-okay.

19:57.062 --> 19:58.162
All right, Warner.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.964
I'm going to give you
a mild sedative

19:59.966 --> 20:01.799
to relax your muscles.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.001
You may feel a slight poke.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.270
Oh, don't worry,
he can handle it.

20:12.077 --> 20:15.146
Doc, uh, how long does
it take for the...?

20:15.148 --> 20:16.581
Oh, there it is, okay.

20:16.583 --> 20:20.184
(slurring):
You're all beautiful people.

20:20.186 --> 20:24.789
Yeah.
(cheering)

20:26.525 --> 20:29.493
Oh, my God, I'm reading
the doctor's obituary,

20:29.495 --> 20:32.763
and ironically he went to Brown.

20:32.765 --> 20:33.731
(laughs)

20:33.733 --> 20:36.434
Hey.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.870
Hi, Warner, I didn't
expect to see you in.

20:39.872 --> 20:40.871
What do you mean?

20:40.873 --> 20:43.507
Oh, you mean
because of yesterday?

20:43.509 --> 20:44.342
(chuckles)

20:44.344 --> 20:47.245
No, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.546
Well, it was worth it.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.348
The insurance was approved,
and you don't have

20:50.350 --> 20:52.016
to have another physical
for two years.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.253
Good, okay, yeah,
just remind me.

20:56.355 --> 20:59.557
Wait, so ha-have you gotten over
your fear of doctors?

20:59.559 --> 21:02.526
Oh, yeah, yeah, you know,
having a doctor die inside me

21:02.528 --> 21:04.729
made me realize
how silly I've been.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.765
(chuckles)

21:07.767 --> 21:10.868
I got your e-mail; your
desk is all set up.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.703
Oh, good, okay.

21:25.751 --> 21:29.120
Are you sure you want
your desk this way?

21:29.122 --> 21:31.322
Yep.

21:33.992 --> 21:35.059
Well, your shoe's untied.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.795
You want to bend over
and get it?

21:38.730 --> 21:40.898
Nope.

21:40.900 --> 21:44.735
Are you just going to stand like
this for the rest of your life?

21:44.737 --> 21:47.004
Yeah.

21:47.006 --> 21:50.474
Well, buddy, you'll always be
number one to me.
