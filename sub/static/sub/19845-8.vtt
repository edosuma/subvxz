are you doing in Little Italy?

You stay in your

00:42.156 --> 00:44.423
I was hoping you'd say that.

01:04.177 --> 01:05.710
Oh thank you for your time, Phil.

You've grown up into such

Yeah, Mikey. What can
I do for you, sir?

like the radio got louder.

03:00.477 --> 03:02.443
Uh, no. I don't think it did, Mikey.

03:02.479 --> 03:04.012
You know what, you're gettin' old.

03:04.047 --> 03:05.446

03:45.843 --> 03:47.752
Remember this used
to be my room, Mikey?

03:47.937 --> 03:50.406
- Heh.
- I can... I remember I was in here

03:50.457 --> 03:51.924
the night Johnny died.

03:51.959 --> 03:53.243
And I was yelling out to him. You

03:53.255 --> 03:54.826
remember the last thing I said to him?

03:54.861 --> 03:58.163
My brother, Johnny, remember
the last thing I said to him?

03:58.281 --> 03:59.997
I said, "I hate you, Johnny.

04:00.033 --> 04:02.500
- I hate you."
- Philly, you were a kid.

04:03.108 --> 04:04.531
Johnny knew you didn't mean it.

04:04.742 --> 04:06.078
Yeah. No, I know.

04:06.406 --> 04:09.117
- (sniffs)
- Hey, Mikey, you, uh,

04:09.309 --> 04:10.828
are you going somewhere?

04:11.944 --> 04:14.511
Oh, ha, that thing, nah.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.997
One of those, you know, nut jobs down

04:17.009 --> 04:19.149
the street were handing 'em out.

04:19.928 --> 04:21.015
Get some sleep.

04:21.524 --> 04:22.925
Oh, and Mikey?

04:23.055 --> 04:27.057
Don't ever raise your voice to me
again in front of the crew. Ever.

04:27.460 --> 04:28.695
(rock music blaring)

04:29.898 --> 04:30.984

04:31.163 --> 04:32.995
Hey, Philly, come have a drink, huh?

04:33.030 --> 04:34.441
- I think I'm gonna hit the hay.
- Come on!

04:34.465 --> 04:36.465
- You guys have fun though.
- Stay out of trouble.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.034
(clears throat) Excuse me, God
bless you. Have a good night.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.436
Good night, boss.

04:41.265 --> 04:43.372
Hon? Hon, are you home?

04:43.407 --> 04:44.974
Phil, is that you?

04:45.009 --> 04:46.241
There's my perfect wife.

04:46.277 --> 04:47.609

04:48.946 --> 04:50.111

04:50.146 --> 04:51.346

04:51.381 --> 04:53.414
Oh, gosh, I've missed you.

04:53.450 --> 04:55.149
Oh, Theresa, you're so innocent.

04:55.185 --> 04:56.762
Let me just say something
right off the bat.

04:56.786 --> 04:58.264
I'm sorry I haven't made time for you.

04:58.288 --> 04:59.553
- Come on!
- I really am.

04:59.589 --> 05:02.290
No, I totally get it.
You gotta run the gang.

05:02.325 --> 05:04.258
- Mm-hmm.
- You deal with several antagonists.

05:04.294 --> 05:05.759
They keep comin' out of nowhere!

05:05.795 --> 05:07.827
And... and a fraying
relationship with Mike.

05:07.863 --> 05:11.631
And not to mention carry on
your dead brother's legacy.

05:11.666 --> 05:15.235
Johnny, rest in peace. Those
are big shoes to fill, Phil.

05:15.270 --> 05:16.870
(chuckles) I love name jokes.

05:16.905 --> 05:18.472
Theresa, you are the love of my life.

05:18.507 --> 05:21.674
And that's the other thing!
There is no conflict between us.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.126
That's true. It's like a roller coaster

05:23.138 --> 05:24.688
that keeps going up
and never has a dip.

05:24.712 --> 05:26.645
We're financially stable.
Mutual bank account.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.014
We're faithful to each other.

05:28.049 --> 05:31.183
Hey, by the way, the guys, they
really appreciated the strippers.

05:31.219 --> 05:32.997
That was a good idea.
The strippers worked out!

05:33.021 --> 05:34.653
They worked out great. Boosted morale.

05:34.688 --> 05:36.266
They need that, you know,
it's Christmas time.

05:36.290 --> 05:37.689
You're the best husband ever.

05:37.725 --> 05:39.458
- Hey, baby?
- Mm-hmm?

05:39.494 --> 05:40.926
Wanna have sex?

05:40.961 --> 05:43.461
Oh. I'm a little...

05:43.497 --> 05:45.396
- bloated.
- Bloated, yeah, okay.

05:45.421 --> 05:47.110
- A massage might be nice.
- Hey, here you go!

05:47.134 --> 05:48.433

05:48.468 --> 05:50.820

05:51.204 --> 05:53.138
Oh, honey, what's that poking me?

05:53.173 --> 05:56.023

around and take a look-see?

06:03.849 --> 06:05.484
Free calendars, look at that.

06:05.509 --> 06:07.717
Don't the Chinese have
a way with calendars?

06:07.753 --> 06:10.521
- Calendars and fireworks.
- Calendars and fire... I always said.

06:10.556 --> 06:12.722
- Calendars and fireworks.
- Calendars and fireworks.

06:12.758 --> 06:14.091
The Chinese know how to do it.

06:14.126 --> 06:15.758
And they're not shy about it!

06:15.793 --> 06:17.560
Um, (clears throat), hey, boss.

06:17.595 --> 06:19.673
Uh, something came up, I need
to talk to you immediately.

06:19.697 --> 06:20.963
(gasps) Is it Phil's crew?

06:20.998 --> 06:22.831
Okay, let's get ready.
I knew this was coming.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.133
- Come on!
- No, no, no, no.

06:24.169 --> 06:25.765

stresses me out, you know.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.408
(sighs) We are an evil crime syndicate,

06:33.444 --> 06:36.344
and the thing that keeps me up
at night is that people here

06:36.380 --> 06:37.946
keep printing full color pages. Why?

06:37.981 --> 06:40.014
- I know.
- They'll stretch out these memes.

06:40.050 --> 06:41.550
- And it's just like a frog.
- Yeah.

06:41.585 --> 06:43.063
- It's got nothing to do with work.
- Yeah.

06:43.087 --> 06:45.742
There's nothing funny
about it, really, in essence.

06:45.767 --> 06:47.021
Yeah, I hear that, I hear.

06:47.057 --> 06:48.834
Yeah, I'm actually working

06:56.265 --> 06:58.099
- Right.
- Why don't you just give us a taste?

Yep.

09:34.848 --> 09:37.382
I've been painting a lot, just
some, you know, watercolors.

09:37.417 --> 09:38.292

09:38.317 --> 09:40.917

09:45.625 --> 09:47.591
But guess who didn't show up. Your boss.

09:47.627 --> 09:49.627
- Fuckin' Phil. Yeah.
- Right? Yeah. Same with me.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.040
You know how bosses are. They
always got somethin' better to do.

09:52.064 --> 09:54.165

We got Nolita.

me, excuse me, Phil?

I'd like to add something
as well if that's all right.

T-Terrence. Yeah. Terrence.

- I think he's an intern?

13:17.991 --> 13:19.586

13:22.294 --> 13:24.936
into a full-blown lymphoma in February,

and after that... (sighs) the tumors.

I wouldn't be here today.

13:36.408 --> 13:37.727

14:03.701 --> 14:05.301
As I was saying, it's
a little hard to...

14:05.335 --> 14:06.635
Honestly, a tough act to follow.

14:06.670 --> 14:09.115

to the equally important thing

14:09.139 --> 14:11.020
- that you were starting with.
- Okay. Go ahead.

This dinner, this celebration,

14:13.872 --> 14:15.439

- Huh?

14:18.135 --> 14:19.186
What the fuck does he mean?

14:19.210 --> 14:21.217
- What does he mean?
- What's he talking about?

14:21.242 --> 14:23.384
From now on,
we're "Phil's Club!"

14:23.419 --> 14:26.153
Take it off, Junior, take the thing off.
Show 'em the sign!

14:26.188 --> 14:29.288
Yeah! You like that?
Cost a lot of money.

14:29.324 --> 14:30.757
We're changing, all right?

14:30.792 --> 14:34.260
Because tomorrow, we're
officially moving to the coast.

14:34.295 --> 14:35.795
We're taking Two Bridges!

14:35.831 --> 14:39.533
Phil's Crew's gonna be the strongest
crew New York City's ever seen.

14:39.568 --> 14:40.578
(cheering)

14:41.503 --> 14:43.275
- (slurps)
- Phil, what are you talking about?

14:43.299 --> 14:44.738
We said "no" on Two Bridges.

14:44.773 --> 14:47.539
You said "no," Mikey.
I said nothing, okay?

14:47.625 --> 14:49.332
You know what, I got
Big Pussy down there

14:49.357 --> 14:51.069
right now on a fuckin' recon mission.

14:51.094 --> 14:53.133
Pickin' up some cronuts.
We're gettin' dessert, boys.

14:53.157 --> 14:54.421
All right, dessert!

14:54.446 --> 14:57.182
Wait. You sent Big Pussy? By himself?

14:57.217 --> 14:58.851
Into fucking enemy territory?

14:58.886 --> 15:00.130
- Whoa, whoa, Big Pussy...
- Are you kidding me?

15:00.154 --> 15:02.654
Big Pussy's fucking tough, all right!
He can fend for himself.

15:02.689 --> 15:04.342
And I'm not afraid of any fucking crew,

15:04.354 --> 15:05.805
especially not Alabaster's crew.

15:05.830 --> 15:07.659
Have you noticed
he hasn't come back yet?

15:07.875 --> 15:09.561
I'm fucking worried over here.
Oh my God.

15:09.596 --> 15:11.574
He's probably just out with
one of his little boyfriends,

15:11.598 --> 15:13.264
the fuckin' fanook.
You know what I mean?

15:13.299 --> 15:14.789
- Fuck you!
- Hey!

15:15.024 --> 15:16.668
The fuck did you just say to me?

15:16.703 --> 15:19.136
I said, a fangoolah!

15:19.172 --> 15:21.337
- You're a fangoolah!
- Hey!

15:21.373 --> 15:23.600
- Fangool!
- You motherfuck!

15:23.625 --> 15:25.039
- Hey, you motherfuck!
- Yeah, your mother!

15:25.063 --> 15:26.101
You butter boy, betcha bum!

15:26.125 --> 15:28.745
- Fangool!
- No, you're the fangool!

15:28.781 --> 15:30.647
- Heeeeeey!
- Heeeeeey!

15:30.683 --> 15:31.689
Sorry to bother you, boss.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.149
What do you want, huh?

15:33.185 --> 15:34.303
You got a package.

15:34.328 --> 15:35.897
- Ooh, what is this?
- Oh, you know what?

15:35.921 --> 15:38.621
I ordered one of those
Tempur-Pedic neck pillows.

15:38.656 --> 15:39.914
I bet it's that.

15:50.744 --> 15:51.789
Aw.

15:52.101 --> 15:53.200
(gags)

15:53.471 --> 15:56.204
- What is it, Philly?
- No, no, no, no, no.

15:56.239 --> 15:58.382
- Fuckin' oh!
- What's in the box?

15:58.407 --> 15:59.686
Get it the fuck out of here,

15:59.711 --> 16:02.351
- I can't fuckin' look at that.
- Let me see, let me see, hold on.

16:03.647 --> 16:04.647
It's his head!

16:05.016 --> 16:07.336
- It's Big Pussy's head in a box!
- No!

16:07.361 --> 16:10.184
They fuckin' Paltrow-ed him.
They fuckin' got Big...

16:10.220 --> 16:11.500
All right, all right, all right!

16:12.117 --> 16:14.722
Everybody suit up, we're
going to war, all right?

16:14.757 --> 16:17.691
Junior, put out the word.
Pier One in 30 minutes, let's go.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.260
Let's go! This ain't a
fuckin' drill, here we go!

16:20.295 --> 16:21.729
Philly, hold on, come on.

16:21.764 --> 16:23.263
Let's think this through, okay?

16:26.649 --> 16:27.649
(snorting)

16:27.688 --> 16:30.169
We got to leave Two Bridges,
all right? We don't need it.

16:30.204 --> 16:31.922
I'm sorry, Mikey, did you not just see

16:31.934 --> 16:33.572
Big Pussy's head in a fucking box?

16:33.608 --> 16:35.889
Hey, I've known Big Pussy
since I was born.

16:35.914 --> 16:37.552
Never in a million years, did I think

16:37.564 --> 16:39.124
I'd see Big Pussy get Paltrow-ed.

16:39.149 --> 16:41.313
- It's fucking crazy.
- Mm-mm-mm.

16:41.349 --> 16:43.219
- It's honestly fucked up.
- Honestly, pretty...

16:43.243 --> 16:45.117
- So fucked up.
- Dude, it's like, so fucking scary.

16:45.141 --> 16:47.363
I didn't even see what was in the box.
I watched you open it.

16:47.387 --> 16:50.069
- Yeah! I felt like barfing.
- The blood left your face.

16:50.094 --> 16:52.609
- I honestly was about to barf.
- I thought you were going to, yeah.

16:52.633 --> 16:54.687
- But you were saying, I'm sorry.
- Sorry, so I was saying.

16:54.711 --> 16:57.023
It's not fuckin' lost on me what
happened to Big Puss, okay?

16:57.047 --> 16:59.197
- Mm-hmm.
- Alabaster? His crew?

16:59.232 --> 17:01.321
They're not like other cats.
They're sick!

17:01.414 --> 17:03.724
I was there at the first
Pier One battle.

17:03.770 --> 17:04.734
Pier One-One.

17:04.781 --> 17:06.671
- Pier Eleven in some dialects.
- Mm-hmm.

17:06.705 --> 17:08.571
You choose to go to war with Alabaster?

17:08.607 --> 17:12.038
All these kids that worship you,
you're sendin' 'em in to die!

17:12.078 --> 17:14.117
Wait, wait, wait. I know why
you don't wanna fight, Mikey.

17:14.142 --> 17:14.905
Why's that?

17:14.930 --> 17:16.258
You don't want to get anymore messed up.

17:16.281 --> 17:19.683
You want to stay pretty so you can
get adopted by some fucking human.

17:19.718 --> 17:21.136
I know why you had that brochure.

17:21.147 --> 17:22.617
What the heck you talkin' about?

17:22.654 --> 17:24.898
You want to leave the fuckin' crew
life, then get out, all right?

17:24.923 --> 17:27.190
Go live with a human and drink
some milk out of a shoe

17:27.224 --> 17:28.903
or whatever the fuck
they do in those houses.

17:28.927 --> 17:31.161
I mean, really, Mikey,
you think you can get adopted?

17:31.196 --> 17:33.555
Look at you with that ear,
you're a fucking monster.

17:34.297 --> 17:35.735
You're the monster, Philly.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.700
You think Johnny would've been proud?

17:37.735 --> 17:39.401
At what his crew's turned into?

17:39.436 --> 17:40.969
The flashiness? The drugs?

17:41.005 --> 17:42.304
- The paw-stitutes?
- (meows)

17:42.339 --> 17:43.872
- Prostitutes but cats.
- Mm-hmm.

17:43.908 --> 17:46.657
We could've restored order, and respect

17:46.805 --> 17:48.633
to being a New York alley cat.

17:49.313 --> 17:50.913
But instead we scratched and bit,

17:50.948 --> 17:53.280
and all the kids got
iPhones and Snapchats.

17:53.316 --> 17:55.416
And I don't get it!
I don't get the template.

17:55.451 --> 17:56.819
I can't find the "follow" button.

17:56.844 --> 17:58.753
"Order and respect," Mikey?
Order and respect?

17:58.788 --> 18:01.413
That went out the window the
night Alabaster killed Johnny,

18:01.438 --> 18:02.804
and you fucking know it, all right?

18:02.828 --> 18:05.193
It's a dog-eat-dog world
and I'm looking for some pussy.

18:05.228 --> 18:06.844
- Let's go!
- (gasps)

18:07.258 --> 18:09.414
Don't dramatically
block the door, Mikey.

18:09.609 --> 18:10.867
You're still young.

18:11.366 --> 18:12.664
Go back to school.

18:13.030 --> 18:14.407
Go to university.

18:14.802 --> 18:15.836
You're smart.

18:16.055 --> 18:17.946
You're not like the rest of us, Philly.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.086
I chose this life, Mikey.

18:20.559 --> 18:21.658
(sniffles)

18:21.944 --> 18:23.409
I love you, Mikey.

18:23.445 --> 18:24.577
I love you, too.

18:24.613 --> 18:26.914
- Do you wanna boy hug?
- Let's boy hug.

18:27.063 --> 18:29.719
You know, like a too
aggressive pat on the back.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.602
I'm gonna slap your back to offset the

18:31.614 --> 18:33.367
fact that I can feel your heartbeat.

18:34.173 --> 18:37.086
It's a beautiful
and confusing thing, us boys.

18:38.529 --> 18:39.984
May God look after you, Philly.

18:40.843 --> 18:41.909
Hard cut.

18:45.930 --> 18:47.961
All right, everybody stay focused, okay?

18:48.399 --> 18:51.102
I don't know where they're...
Shh, what the fuck was that?

18:51.138 --> 18:52.461
Alabaster: Mmmm!

18:53.946 --> 18:55.673
Philip, right?

18:56.047 --> 18:58.943
You're Johnny's kid
brother, all grown up.

18:59.258 --> 19:01.812
(scoffs) I remember
the last time we was here

19:01.847 --> 19:03.613
and you were crying like a baby.

19:03.649 --> 19:07.117
Waa! Waa, Johnny! You remember that?

19:07.153 --> 19:09.153
Goo-goo-ga-ga.

19:09.196 --> 19:11.328
Little baby. (chuckling)

19:12.191 --> 19:14.369
(whispers) Psst, hey, Terrence.
You're gonna make it, buddy.

19:14.393 --> 19:16.093
Thank you so much for your support.

19:16.128 --> 19:17.835
Always so nice to meet a fan.

19:17.860 --> 19:18.840
Let me ask you something.

19:18.865 --> 19:21.230
How'd you know Big Pussy was
gonna be in Two Bridges, huh?

19:21.266 --> 19:23.232
Well, I had a little help
from my friend.

19:23.268 --> 19:26.530
You might know him as Father Anthony.

19:26.555 --> 19:29.405
(with Irish accent) Well, what do
we have here? A bunch of jerk-offs.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.957
Father Anthony, you
don't wanna be here,

19:30.981 --> 19:32.519
all right? Things are
about to get messy.

19:32.543 --> 19:33.875
- Oh, Father Anthony?
- Yeah.

19:33.902 --> 19:34.992
Or is it...

19:35.053 --> 19:36.124
Voila.

19:36.513 --> 19:38.880
Wait. Father Anthony, you're bald?

19:38.916 --> 19:41.482
Listen, dumbass, my real
name is Gigglepuss.

19:41.518 --> 19:43.018
You killed my brother, Chuckles,

19:43.053 --> 19:45.353
now I'm gonna kill you for revenge.

19:45.388 --> 19:47.989
Oh! I really thought
you was Irish this whole time.

19:48.025 --> 19:48.736
Are you an actor?

19:48.761 --> 19:50.491
Look, we're all actors in some respect.

19:50.527 --> 19:52.526
But I'm trying to be
a professional actor, yeah.

19:52.561 --> 19:54.328
- Wow!
- I got a one-man show going now.

19:54.363 --> 19:56.541
- It's doing really well...
- Oh, here it is with the one-man show.

19:56.565 --> 20:00.034
So, anyway. Yeah, guys, I
want revenge on Alabaster.

20:00.069 --> 20:02.402
- Gigglepuss wants revenge on me.
- Bingo.

20:02.438 --> 20:03.938
Now this has gotten a little muddy.

20:03.973 --> 20:05.706
- I agree.
- It is a little muddy, but...

20:05.731 --> 20:08.532
- Why don't we just go at it?
- All-out brawl type of thing.

20:08.577 --> 20:09.775
I like to call it a melee.

20:09.811 --> 20:12.011
- Ooh! A melee!
- Yeah, I like that.

20:12.047 --> 20:15.181
Complete chaos, and then
whoever wins is the winner.

20:15.217 --> 20:16.861
- Okay, yeah, that sounds great.
- That sound good?

20:16.885 --> 20:18.362
- This is gonna be fun.
- Okay, so let's...

20:18.386 --> 20:20.353
All three: One, two, three.

20:20.388 --> 20:21.657
(yowling, snarling)

20:32.586 --> 20:33.852
Gig flies!

20:34.571 --> 20:35.852
(Gigglepuss yowling)

20:36.303 --> 20:37.970
Just make it quick, all right?

20:38.005 --> 20:39.338
Aw, no!

20:39.373 --> 20:41.706
- For Big Pussy!
- (yowls)

20:43.297 --> 20:44.976
- Mikey!
- Did I fucking kill him?

20:45.011 --> 20:47.144
You fucking killed Gigglepuss, dude!

20:47.180 --> 20:48.746
I fucking didn't mean to kill him.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.356
All right, focus up! Focus up!

20:50.383 --> 20:51.477
(yowling)

20:53.519 --> 20:54.952
All right, Alabaster.

20:54.988 --> 20:57.977
It's you and me, buddy.
You ready to meet your maker?

20:58.002 --> 20:59.956
Ah, Johnny's knife.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.125
Well, I have something
of Johnny's as well.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.426
What, like a gift?

21:03.461 --> 21:05.996
Yeah, it's like a gift.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.586
You remember this?

21:07.953 --> 21:09.149
Johnny's tooth.

21:09.446 --> 21:10.879
Oh, you recognize it?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.733
Phil, what is it? I can't see.

21:12.758 --> 21:14.718
It's Johhny's tooth.
He pulled out Johnny's tooth.

21:14.742 --> 21:17.797
I've got Johnny's switchblade.
It's very symbolic. Feels good.

21:17.822 --> 21:20.157
All right, stay focused.
Stop talking to me.

21:20.391 --> 21:21.925
All right, Alabaster.

21:21.950 --> 21:23.842
Let's finish this once and for all.

21:23.867 --> 21:27.883
Yeah, let me finish it
once and for all for you.

21:27.919 --> 21:29.218
Okey-doke.

21:29.253 --> 21:30.461
(both grunting)

21:32.990 --> 21:34.321
And then I'll... I'll flip.

21:34.690 --> 21:35.990
- Oh, will you now?
- Haha.

21:36.026 --> 21:37.870
- What if I did this, huh?
- Yeah, what if you did?

21:37.894 --> 21:39.294
- Okay, I tried.
- Oh!

21:41.429 --> 21:42.862

21:54.063 --> 21:56.063

Oh, you got me.

21:56.267 --> 21:58.934
