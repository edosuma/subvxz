WEBVTT

00:04.504 --> 00:06.704
Peter, not inside the house.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.435
Uncle Leo!

00:08.437 --> 00:09.702
Peter, - Gotcha!

00:09.704 --> 00:11.453
Be careful.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.696
The gun thing makes me crazy,

00:14.698 --> 00:16.631
but Peter and his friends
seem to be loving it.

00:16.633 --> 00:17.832
Come on, sis.

00:17.834 --> 00:21.136
They're boys. All boys love guns.

00:21.138 --> 00:23.538
No. I know, you're right.

00:23.540 --> 00:25.206
And...

00:25.208 --> 00:27.375
thank you for paying for it.

00:30.814 --> 00:31.980
This is looking good.

00:31.982 --> 00:33.725
Is that Cecilia Novak?

00:34.451 --> 00:35.950
Yeah, we have a warrant
to search the premises.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.886
We need to look under
this deck right here.

00:37.888 --> 00:39.454
Hey, can you...

00:39.456 --> 00:42.190
give me a minute? Just give me a minute.

00:42.192 --> 00:44.392
Hey, kids, parents,

00:44.394 --> 00:45.560
can you, grab your plates

00:45.562 --> 00:47.195
and then bring 'em into the house?

00:47.197 --> 00:48.830
There's a lot oflot of bugs out here.

00:48.832 --> 00:51.533
Justjust grab your plates
and bringbring it inside.

00:58.442 --> 01:01.109
I swear to God, I have no
idea what's going on here.

01:01.111 --> 01:02.544
Don't say another word.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.482
My...

01:07.484 --> 01:08.917
Wow, that is quite a haul.

01:08.919 --> 01:10.185
Those aren't mine. You know that, right?

01:10.187 --> 01:11.286
Those are not mine.

01:11.288 --> 01:12.821
Hey. Hey, that's not necessary.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.522
C... Could you do it
around the side of the house,

01:14.524 --> 01:15.851
away from the windows?

01:16.893 --> 01:18.560
Mom!

01:18.562 --> 01:21.496
Peter, honey, it's okay.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.566
Sis... Just go back to Peter.

01:24.568 --> 01:25.900
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:25.902 --> 01:27.836
I'm calling my lawyer right now.
Don't worry.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.038
Everything's gonna be fine,
I'll take care of it.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.147
We know you have a choice

01:39.149 --> 01:41.483
when it comes to
trial science companies.

01:41.485 --> 01:43.086
Thank you.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.520
Nice.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.555
Yours?

01:47.557 --> 01:48.990
A client's.

01:48.992 --> 01:52.026
Please apologize to your staff
about having to fly commercial.

01:52.028 --> 01:55.515
I just wanted you to myself
so we could discuss the case.

01:55.517 --> 01:56.931
Okay.

01:56.933 --> 01:58.833
Tell me about this mysterious case.

01:58.835 --> 02:01.230
Once we're in the air.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.402
Okay. I'm 30,000 feet up
without a parachute.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.168
What are we doing
and who are we doing it for?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.851
Her name is Cecilia Novak.

02:16.853 --> 02:19.554
She's a single mother,
has a tenyearold son.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.456
Works as a dental technician.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.324
Very involved in her church.

02:23.326 --> 02:24.893
Volunteers on her weekends

02:24.895 --> 02:26.561
helping to feed the homebound.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.363
And yet she's accused of...

02:28.365 --> 02:31.099
Hiding six kilos of heroin
beneath her home.

02:31.101 --> 02:33.468
And I'm here to tell you
she didn't do it.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.437
Well, apparently someone did.

02:35.439 --> 02:37.739
That's not the kind of thing
you park under your house

02:37.741 --> 02:39.518
and forget.

02:40.777 --> 02:42.977
That's got to be worth a million bucks.

02:42.979 --> 02:44.579
What's she looking at, 30 years?

02:44.581 --> 02:46.114
Give or take.

02:48.285 --> 02:50.185
You doing this pro bono?

02:50.187 --> 02:51.953
No. Why?

02:51.955 --> 02:53.154
Come on.

02:53.156 --> 02:55.123
A young, single mother

02:55.125 --> 02:57.025
can't afford your services,

02:57.027 --> 02:59.661
let alone a jet like this.

02:59.663 --> 03:01.331
So...

03:01.765 --> 03:03.465
whose dime are we spending here?

03:03.467 --> 03:04.543
Boyfriend?

03:05.268 --> 03:06.868
Family member?

03:10.841 --> 03:12.640
Clearly, someone in this woman's sphere

03:12.642 --> 03:13.942
is in the drug trade.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.711
She is being charged
with hiding their drugs,

03:16.713 --> 03:20.215
and that someone is obviously
paying for you.

03:20.217 --> 03:22.317
I fail to see the relevance.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.752
Well, here's the relevance.

03:24.754 --> 03:26.888
I don't work for drug traffickers.

03:30.894 --> 03:33.261
I'm waiting for you to tell me
we don't have a problem.

03:33.263 --> 03:35.497
I plead the fifth.

03:35.499 --> 03:37.098
Well, then we're
turning the plane around.

03:37.100 --> 03:39.767
Bull, we're not working
for drug traffickers.

03:39.769 --> 03:42.570
We're working for this woman,
Cecilia Novak,

03:42.572 --> 03:45.440
who, I swear to you,
has nothing to do with drugs.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.775
Whose defense is being funded
by drug money.

03:47.777 --> 03:49.210
I don't know that.

03:50.520 --> 03:51.757
Well...

03:52.849 --> 03:54.616
what do you know?

03:55.919 --> 03:57.387
Look.

03:57.954 --> 04:01.523
Cecilia's brother
is a man named Leo Novak.

04:01.525 --> 04:05.426
Allegedly, he runs the Miami
cell of the Baski drug cartel.

04:05.428 --> 04:07.862
A fact that's never
been proven, by the way.

04:07.864 --> 04:10.164
And you don't think there's just
the itsybitsiest chance

04:10.166 --> 04:11.633
that he might be footing the bill

04:11.635 --> 04:14.335
<i>for you, me, and
Battlestar Galactica here?</i>

04:14.337 --> 04:16.337
Full disclosure:

04:16.339 --> 04:18.640
Leo is a client of the firm's.

04:18.642 --> 04:21.041
Another partner, a lawyer
named Gary Sharp,

04:21.043 --> 04:22.176
brought him in.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.546
Obviously, the drugs belong to Leo.

04:24.548 --> 04:26.347
I have no way of knowing that.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.683
And besides, that's not the issue.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.796
I know you don't
want to hear this, but...

04:31.555 --> 04:33.288
it is, for me.

04:33.290 --> 04:35.223
I'm gonna go talk to the pilot.
We're turning around.

04:35.225 --> 04:38.726
Hey, Bull, this woman does not
deserve to go to prison.

04:40.330 --> 04:42.297
And I'm not sure

04:42.299 --> 04:44.465
I can untangle this mess alone.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.036
Meet her.

04:48.465 --> 04:50.632
Just meet her.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.908
You know, this'd be a whole lot
easier if you didn't

04:53.910 --> 04:56.578
carry that face around with you
every time we did business.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.784
Look, you owe me two more cases.

05:02.786 --> 05:04.886
Just stick with me on this one

05:04.888 --> 05:06.854
and we'll call it even.

05:06.856 --> 05:08.590
Well, don't do that.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.794
Okay.

05:11.294 --> 05:14.673
Stick with me on this one
and we'll make it 30 more cases.

05:15.165 --> 05:16.798
No more cases.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.099
A hundred cases.

05:18.101 --> 05:21.569
Just stick with me.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.244 --> 05:45.768
Fancy.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.539
This is Leo's boat.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.472
Who'da thunk it?

05:49.474 --> 05:52.742
My question for you is
what are you doing here?

05:52.744 --> 05:56.079
A boat like this reeks of drug money.

05:56.081 --> 05:59.315
Not doing yourself any favors
in the court of public opinion.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.750
Well, unfortunately,

06:00.752 --> 06:02.752
the DEA seized my home,

06:02.754 --> 06:04.120
froze my bank accounts

06:04.122 --> 06:06.016
and took my car.

06:06.358 --> 06:08.310
Yesterday, my boss let me go.

06:09.094 --> 06:11.661
I need a safe place for my son and me.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.163
Leo offered this up.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.766
It's not like
I'm in a position to say no.

06:16.768 --> 06:18.368
Now that you've brought him up,

06:18.370 --> 06:20.370
we need to talk about your brother.

06:20.372 --> 06:23.406
I have to believe that's who
they're really after here.

06:23.408 --> 06:26.009
Has anyone mentioned a plea?

06:26.011 --> 06:28.845
I know what everyone claims
my brother does.

06:30.782 --> 06:32.918
We don't talk about his work.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.251
But when I gave birth to Peter,

06:35.253 --> 06:37.153
he made me a promise.

06:37.547 --> 06:38.821
Trouble would never enter my home

06:38.823 --> 06:40.323
or be a part of my life.

06:40.325 --> 06:42.225
And he's always kept that promise.

06:45.130 --> 06:47.096
Anybody feel like grouper for dinner?

06:47.098 --> 06:48.998
Peter.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.667
Look at you.

06:50.669 --> 06:52.001
How's my fisherman?

06:52.003 --> 06:53.269
I'm okay.

06:55.006 --> 06:56.105
Come on.

06:56.107 --> 06:57.740
How many fish did you catch?

06:57.742 --> 06:59.976
Like, eight. Eight? Wow.

06:59.978 --> 07:01.644
You folks want a little tour?

07:01.646 --> 07:04.647
J.P. says you're a shrink.

07:04.649 --> 07:07.350
Says you can find a jury
to acquit my sister.

07:07.352 --> 07:10.586
Well, I've certainly been known to help.

07:10.588 --> 07:12.822
I know it goes without saying, but...

07:12.824 --> 07:14.290
anything you need.

07:14.292 --> 07:15.961
Duly noted.

07:16.795 --> 07:18.394
What do you know about me?

07:18.396 --> 07:22.092
I know almost nothing,
but I suspect a great deal.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.661
Have you heard of Silens?

07:26.663 --> 07:28.029
No.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.364
They're a cartel out of Haiti.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.900
Some people think they're
trafficking in narcotics.

07:31.902 --> 07:34.002
Personally, I wouldn't know.

07:34.004 --> 07:37.338
But some areas
of our businesses overlap.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.107
I sense you're trying to make a point,

07:39.109 --> 07:40.441
but it's flying right past me.

07:40.443 --> 07:43.244
It's pretty simple. We're competitors.

07:43.246 --> 07:44.779
But instead of letting the marketplace

07:44.781 --> 07:45.880
decide who's winning,

07:45.882 --> 07:48.516
they chose to violate
the home of my sister,

07:48.518 --> 07:51.920
plant a vast quantity of drugs,
and then tip off the DEA.

07:51.922 --> 07:53.054
That's quite a theory.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.555
Who else could it be?

07:54.557 --> 07:55.757
And how could those agents know

07:55.759 --> 07:57.692
exactly where the drugs were?

07:57.694 --> 07:58.927
They're doing this because they can't

07:58.929 --> 08:00.228
get to me any other way.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.674
Okay, that's a theory.

08:02.986 --> 08:06.154
Here's another. The drugs belong to you.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.640
Two things. Number one,

08:12.642 --> 08:14.676
in order for you to posit that theory,

08:14.678 --> 08:16.044
you'd have to make an assumption

08:16.046 --> 08:19.013
I strongly discourage you from making.

08:19.015 --> 08:23.184
And, number two, she's
my sister, he's my nephew.

08:23.186 --> 08:25.720
Why would I choose to do that to them?

08:31.661 --> 08:33.163
I'm sorry.

08:33.897 --> 08:36.364
For what? We took
a nice airplane ride,

08:36.366 --> 08:38.131
we met some nice people.

08:38.134 --> 08:41.903
I know it all seems
ridiculously unsavory.

08:41.905 --> 08:44.005
Is that what it is?

08:44.006 --> 08:45.373
Is that that feeling in my stomach?

08:45.375 --> 08:46.615
I couldn't put my finger on it.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.811
No. Speaking of unsavory...

08:49.813 --> 08:52.174
Welcome to the 305, my dear.

08:52.247 --> 08:53.815
Boy.

08:55.118 --> 08:58.086
Dr. Jason Bull, this is
one of my partners, Gary Sharp.

08:58.088 --> 08:59.887
He runs the Miami office.

08:59.889 --> 09:01.289
Leo is actually his client.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.424
Nice to meet you, Dr. Bull.

09:03.426 --> 09:05.693
I, aw them setting up
your video game arcade

09:05.695 --> 09:06.728
in one of the ballrooms.

09:06.730 --> 09:09.908
Lots of bells and whistles.

09:10.433 --> 09:13.034
And how was my boy Leo?
Did he behave himself?

09:13.036 --> 09:14.869
Well, he didn't commit any felonies

09:14.871 --> 09:17.305
while we were with him, so...

09:17.999 --> 09:19.340
Pardon me?

09:19.342 --> 09:21.242
Well, you are pardoned.

09:21.244 --> 09:22.977
Your client, on the other hand,

09:22.979 --> 09:24.946
I think he's still waiting
for a call from the governor.

09:24.948 --> 09:27.281
Okay, so you guys met, that's good.

09:27.283 --> 09:29.417
- We...
- So what's the game plan?

09:29.419 --> 09:30.952
When do I get
a jury questionnaire to review?

09:30.954 --> 09:32.820
Voir dire's right around the corner.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.522
Yeah, I apologize.
We've been on the ground

09:34.524 --> 09:35.790
a whole two and a half hours,

09:35.792 --> 09:37.152
how could I not have that for you?

09:38.261 --> 09:39.562
Cute.

09:40.363 --> 09:42.497
Well, I guess I'll just
go back to my office,

09:42.499 --> 09:44.132
wait for you to email something over.

09:45.026 --> 09:46.634
Nice meeting you, Doc.

09:46.636 --> 09:47.902
It is, isn't it?

09:50.807 --> 09:52.540
The streets of Miami were turned into

09:52.542 --> 09:55.176
a deadly battlefield earlier today...

09:55.178 --> 09:56.844
when a shooting war broke out
between members

09:56.846 --> 09:58.555
of rival drug cartels.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.014
Police say they believe...

10:00.016 --> 10:01.916
I was just watching this in my room.

10:01.918 --> 10:04.085
You think this is special for us,

10:04.087 --> 10:06.154
or do they do it for everyone
who comes down to Miami?

10:06.156 --> 10:09.490
I mean, it's a gunfight
between two drug cartels.

10:09.492 --> 10:12.527
On the street. Where families live.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.295
I mean, these are very
scary people, Bull.

10:14.297 --> 10:16.130
Seven confirmed dead,

10:16.132 --> 10:18.232
five from the Silens cartel.

10:24.074 --> 10:26.040
The picture of innocence.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.911
And yet...

10:29.913 --> 10:32.680
you run with a pretty rough crowd.

10:32.682 --> 10:34.682
Seven dead today.

10:34.684 --> 10:36.453
What are we doing?

10:37.954 --> 10:39.420
Defending a young mother

10:39.422 --> 10:41.856
- accused of something she didn't do.
- Okay.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.558
<i>Save that stuff for the Law Review.</i>

10:43.560 --> 10:44.792
If you want to defend young mothers,

10:44.794 --> 10:46.027
I'll drive you up to the Bronx,

10:46.029 --> 10:48.129
and you can throw a rock
and hit 25 of 'em.

10:48.131 --> 10:49.697
<i>What are we doing here</i>

10:49.699 --> 10:52.633
<i>defending this particular mother?</i>

10:52.635 --> 10:54.435
She's looking at 30 years.

10:54.437 --> 10:56.237
She's gonna need
the best counsel she can get.

10:57.340 --> 10:59.740
Yeah, the jury is not quite buying that.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.510
And my staff is so scared,

11:02.512 --> 11:04.645
they're getting ready
to swim back to New York.

11:04.647 --> 11:06.983
Okay. How 'bout this?

11:08.318 --> 11:10.818
When I joined
Reed, Strauss, and Associates

11:10.820 --> 11:12.019
almost eight years ago...

11:12.021 --> 11:13.387
Before your name was on the door...

11:13.389 --> 11:16.457
Guys like that fellow Gary
you met this afternoon,

11:16.459 --> 11:18.793
they were the real rainmakers
at the firm.

11:18.795 --> 11:20.328
Defending professional criminals

11:20.330 --> 11:21.863
is a pretty lucrative business model

11:21.865 --> 11:23.297
if you can stand the smell.

11:23.299 --> 11:26.968
Funny, you strike me as having
a more refined olfactory sense.

11:26.970 --> 11:29.504
Yeah, I never swam
in that end of the pool.

11:29.964 --> 11:32.540
I grew the litigation
and transactional business,

11:32.542 --> 11:35.009
opened offices in New Jersey
and Connecticut

11:35.011 --> 11:37.178
and finally got my name
on the stationery.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.747
But the Garys of the firm
still bring in the big loot.

11:40.141 --> 11:41.549
And I made my peace with that.

11:41.551 --> 11:42.783
Until?

11:43.311 --> 11:45.786
A week ago, I was called
into a video conference.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.488
Cecilia had been arrested,

11:47.490 --> 11:49.624
and Leo wanted the firm
to take care of it.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.926
But Gary didn't want
to take the lead on the case.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.695
He felt sure that if it was him walking

11:54.697 --> 11:56.531
into the court to defend Leo's sister...

11:56.533 --> 12:00.001
All they'd see was a mob lawyer
trying to game the system.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.770
So he asked me to take the lead.

12:03.206 --> 12:04.438
And I said no.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.274
Good girl.

12:06.276 --> 12:08.075
Can I go pack now?

12:09.462 --> 12:12.146
And then he told me, if I did it,

12:12.148 --> 12:14.448
he would convince
the other partners to let me

12:14.450 --> 12:16.817
buy myself out, take my clients,

12:16.819 --> 12:19.487
- open my own practice.
- Ambitious.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.556
I admire that.

12:21.558 --> 12:24.859
He had the paperwork drawn up
the next day.

12:24.861 --> 12:26.394
I just need him to sign it.

12:26.396 --> 12:28.429
Except you have to win first.

12:34.938 --> 12:37.305
I know I tricked you into coming here.

12:37.307 --> 12:40.441
I wasn't very transparent
until it was too late.

12:42.278 --> 12:44.539
But the truth is,
I could really use your help.

12:45.206 --> 12:48.149
And Cecilia, who I really care about,

12:48.151 --> 12:50.284
could really use your help.

12:51.087 --> 12:53.221
There's that face again.

12:53.756 --> 12:54.855
Sorry.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.158
I meant to leave it in the room.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.460
I'll see you in court.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.700
See you in court.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.417
We've got a problem.

13:23.419 --> 13:24.819
What's that?

13:25.288 --> 13:26.921
They don't want to serve.

13:27.373 --> 13:29.523
What are you talking about? On the jury?

13:29.525 --> 13:31.826
Nobody ever wants to serve.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.229
They've seen the news.
They know who's on trial.

13:35.673 --> 13:38.699
And no one wants to wind up
on the bottom of the Atlantic.

13:39.385 --> 13:42.303
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a criminal trial.

13:42.305 --> 13:45.539
Is there anyone here who doesn't feel

13:45.541 --> 13:50.211
they can be a fair and
impartial member of this jury?

13:50.213 --> 13:52.380
Okay.

13:52.382 --> 13:55.016
I have a child at home
and no one to take care of him.

13:55.018 --> 13:57.151
And how old is your son?

13:57.654 --> 13:58.753
23.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.788
My dog is very sick.

14:00.790 --> 14:02.356
My car really isn't dependable.

14:02.358 --> 14:03.891
I actually use drugs,

14:04.202 --> 14:06.027
so I'm not sure I could be objective

14:06.029 --> 14:09.163
with regards to a case
that actually involved drugs.

14:09.165 --> 14:11.365
Your Honor, may we approach?

14:14.037 --> 14:15.736
- What do we...
- Wait. Hold on.

14:15.738 --> 14:17.071
Clearly,

14:17.073 --> 14:18.806
these jurors are terrified.
And not without cause.

14:18.808 --> 14:20.775
I mean, we've all seen
the recent rash of violence

14:20.777 --> 14:21.976
involving this defendant.

14:21.978 --> 14:24.812
Objection. This defendant
has no direct connection

14:24.814 --> 14:28.282
to any violence of any kind, and
the prosecution team knows it.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.650
I need a jury to have a trial, folks.

14:29.652 --> 14:32.453
Any thoughts about how we might proceed?

14:33.756 --> 14:35.956
Okay.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.427
Everybody out!

14:39.862 --> 14:40.928
Out!

14:40.930 --> 14:42.407
Out!

14:43.116 --> 14:44.909
I have a solution.

14:45.835 --> 14:48.469
See you all back here in one hour!

15:08.191 --> 15:10.458
- It's an anonymous jury.
- A what?

15:10.460 --> 15:12.360
An anonymous jury.
They're gonna sit back here

15:12.362 --> 15:14.328
and watch the whole trial on television.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.530
But why?

15:16.532 --> 15:18.499
So we never get to see their faces.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.601
We never know who they are.

15:23.039 --> 15:24.905
So, how does this work?

15:24.907 --> 15:28.576
I mean, in terms of you
doing what you do.

15:30.413 --> 15:33.848
I don't know.
I've never been here before.

15:43.025 --> 15:46.036
Your Honor, you can't be
serious. How can I be expected

15:46.070 --> 15:47.803
to mount an effective defense
for my client

15:47.805 --> 15:49.338
if I can't see the jury,

15:49.340 --> 15:52.007
if I can't gauge their reactions
to what they're hearing

15:52.009 --> 15:53.075
and who they're hearing it from?

15:53.077 --> 15:55.110
Before you get too worked up,

15:55.112 --> 15:56.311
there's precedent.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.180
<i>U.S. v. Dinkins.</i>

15:59.192 --> 16:01.216
And how 'bout you, Counselor?

16:01.527 --> 16:03.185
Would you like to file a complaint?

16:03.404 --> 16:04.886
No, we're totally on board
with this arrangement.

16:04.888 --> 16:06.855
How amenable of you.

16:06.857 --> 16:08.790
With all due respect, Your Honor,

16:08.792 --> 16:11.126
don't you think forcing them
to hide behind a screen

16:11.128 --> 16:13.462
is going to convince them
they should be afraid?

16:13.464 --> 16:15.464
No. I don't think so.

16:15.466 --> 16:18.109
So how is this gonna work then?
Are you gonna wear a hooded robe

16:18.111 --> 16:20.594
- with little cutouts for eyes?
- Pardon me?

16:20.619 --> 16:22.687
Well, that's the implication, that this
courtroom

16:22.689 --> 16:24.973
is not safe and everyone needs to hide.

16:24.975 --> 16:26.008
Well, I'm not hiding.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.477
I'll be in plain sight, as will you

16:29.197 --> 16:30.611
and all the officers of this court.

16:30.613 --> 16:32.558
And this meeting is over.

16:32.815 --> 16:34.815
Now let's start voir dire.

16:34.817 --> 16:37.884
They can hide their faces, but
they can't hide their voices,

16:37.886 --> 16:40.120
their delivery, choice of syntax,

16:40.122 --> 16:43.223
word choice, intonation,
emotional response.

16:43.225 --> 16:44.891
And you can tell from that?

16:44.893 --> 16:47.060
Well, I think so.

16:50.199 --> 16:52.666
Are you a native Floridian?

16:52.668 --> 16:55.969
Born in Vermont.
Lived in Miami for 22 years.

16:55.971 --> 16:59.106
White male. Deep, coarse voice,

16:59.108 --> 17:00.941
suggests to me he's tall.

17:00.943 --> 17:02.542
Probably over 50.

17:02.544 --> 17:04.778
And that means we want him?

17:04.780 --> 17:07.513
I need to figure this out.

17:14.189 --> 17:17.124
Do you have a favorite zoo animal?

17:17.126 --> 17:18.825
Zoo animal?

17:18.827 --> 17:20.460
Well, let me think.

17:20.462 --> 17:22.462
Flamingoes, because they're pink.

17:22.464 --> 17:24.564
- Female.
- Weird answer, but it's true.

17:24.566 --> 17:25.898
Early 20s.

17:25.901 --> 17:27.834
Breathy, highpitched.

17:27.836 --> 17:29.703
Voice has sex appeal.

17:29.705 --> 17:31.972
Tells me she doesn't get
embarrassed easily.

17:31.974 --> 17:33.907
And that's what we want.

17:33.909 --> 17:35.842
She won't be afraid to hear the truth.

17:35.844 --> 17:38.679
And I suspect she's gonna be
able to relate to Cecilia.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.847
Juror number three...

17:40.849 --> 17:42.683
heavyset, smoker,

17:42.685 --> 17:44.484
lots of allergies.

17:44.486 --> 17:46.753
God bless you.

17:46.755 --> 17:49.856
She presents nicely
but resents everyone privately.

17:50.898 --> 17:52.824
Hates the fact that she smokes.

17:52.849 --> 17:56.430
Equates it with drug addiction,
which is not good for our team.

17:56.432 --> 17:57.698
She's out.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.734
But juror number six,
who said "God bless you,"

18:01.355 --> 18:03.437
good inside and out.

18:03.439 --> 18:04.771
She's in.

18:04.773 --> 18:06.573
We have our jury.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.043
We'll resume tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.545
Cecilia, J.P.

18:11.547 --> 18:13.346
I just got off the phone
with the U.S. attorney.

18:13.348 --> 18:15.382
We're prepared to make this
whole thing go away tonight.

18:15.384 --> 18:16.616
I have a list of questions.

18:16.618 --> 18:18.318
You just provide verifiable answers...

18:18.320 --> 18:20.253
These are questions about my brother.

18:20.255 --> 18:21.788
Of course.

18:21.790 --> 18:23.753
MMs. Novak,

18:23.755 --> 18:25.392
I'm offering you a chance
to save yourself.

18:25.394 --> 18:27.527
Youyou have a child. Don't be foolish.

18:27.529 --> 18:29.196
We appreciate the offer, Counselor.

18:29.198 --> 18:31.932
My client and I will take it
under advisement. Thank you.

18:34.722 --> 18:37.804
Okay, now, I know that wasn't
what you wanted to hear

18:37.806 --> 18:40.978
and it's not what we came here
to do, but...

18:41.343 --> 18:44.878
from my perspective,
that is an awfully good offer.

18:45.191 --> 18:46.747
He's my brother.

18:46.749 --> 18:48.715
And you're his sister. And
let's say he's telling the truth

18:48.717 --> 18:50.717
and those drugs were planted by Silens.

18:50.719 --> 18:53.587
That means they were going
after him, not you.

18:53.589 --> 18:55.622
You should not go to prison for him.

18:55.624 --> 18:57.657
I will do anything for him.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.559
And he will do anything for me.

18:59.561 --> 19:00.694
Sorry,

19:00.696 --> 19:03.063
but other than write a big check to J.P.

19:03.065 --> 19:04.798
and send armed goons into the street,

19:04.800 --> 19:06.933
I haven't seen him do a damn thing.

19:06.935 --> 19:08.802
Thank you, Mr. Bull.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.971
Can you get yourself back to the hotel?

19:10.973 --> 19:12.873
My client and I need to have
a private conversation.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.375
Right.

19:20.349 --> 19:22.616
When I was a little girl

19:22.618 --> 19:25.273
and civil war broke out in Croatia,

19:26.190 --> 19:30.236
I watched my parents get
gunned down by a firing squad.

19:30.945 --> 19:32.592
I was nine.

19:32.594 --> 19:35.262
I started shaking, quaking.

19:35.264 --> 19:36.450
Shock.

19:37.285 --> 19:39.933
My brother would hold me, hug me,

19:40.371 --> 19:42.569
try to get my body to stop.

19:42.873 --> 19:46.006
And then he finally found a way
out of there, out of Croatia.

19:46.008 --> 19:47.670
12 years old.

19:48.713 --> 19:50.631
And my body stopped shaking.

19:52.689 --> 19:55.136
He protected me in the refugee camps.

19:56.053 --> 19:57.888
He got us to America.

20:00.850 --> 20:02.889
And he never left me.

20:02.891 --> 20:05.062
My brother never left me.

20:06.762 --> 20:08.566
So you tell me now,

20:09.798 --> 20:11.464
if you don't think you can do this,

20:11.466 --> 20:12.566
I will get someone else.

20:12.568 --> 20:14.467
My brother will get me someone else.

20:14.469 --> 20:16.449
We can do this.

20:19.675 --> 20:21.842
We can do this.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.119
What is your problem?

20:33.507 --> 20:34.955
Well, I'm trying to save her life.

20:34.957 --> 20:37.274
I'm sorry if that doesn't work
with your business model.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.226
How dare you?

20:39.597 --> 20:41.761
You call yourself a psychologist?

20:41.763 --> 20:44.231
Wake up, Bull. That woman is

20:44.233 --> 20:45.465
never taking a deal.

20:45.467 --> 20:48.201
The only lifeline she has is us,

20:48.203 --> 20:50.403
defending her in court.

20:53.108 --> 20:55.642
I'm gonna head back
to the hotel. On my own.

20:57.948 --> 20:59.946
And I meant what I said on the plane.

21:00.451 --> 21:02.817
This should be our last case.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.467
The anonymous tip is the key.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.357
Whoever it was that called the DEA,

21:19.695 --> 21:22.630
well, they know whose
drugs they really are.

21:22.632 --> 21:25.066
And if we can link it to Silens,

21:25.643 --> 21:28.536
I think we can convince the jury
the drugs were planted.

21:28.538 --> 21:32.039
It's funny you say that. Danny
put me on to a lead yesterday.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.443
A guy connected
to all things Silens and Baski.

21:35.445 --> 21:37.611
Yeah. We wanted to pay him
a visit this morning

21:37.613 --> 21:40.214
but, price of admission is five K.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.941
Well, Leo said the vault's open.
Anything we want.

21:42.943 --> 21:45.077
Marissa, why don't you call
J.P.'s Miami office

21:45.079 --> 21:47.046
and line up some cash.

21:47.048 --> 21:48.414
Will do.

21:48.416 --> 21:50.449
Actually, where is J.P.?

21:50.451 --> 21:52.351
Aren't you guys going to court together?

21:53.287 --> 21:55.220
Well, she probably just wanted to

21:55.222 --> 21:57.323
be alone for a little bit.

21:58.858 --> 22:01.092
You know what they say
about too much of a good thing.

22:22.350 --> 22:24.717
Ye of little faith.

22:26.187 --> 22:28.754
Well, you seem surprisingly chipper.

22:28.756 --> 22:30.956
You know how it is.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.791
Just when it seems all is lost,

22:32.793 --> 22:35.394
the answer suddenly appears to you.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.695
Do tell.

22:36.697 --> 22:39.535
Xray specs.

22:39.537 --> 22:40.999
You know what I'm talking about.

22:41.001 --> 22:44.069
Advertised in some of the finer
comic books and men's magazines.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.437
We just put 'em on,

22:45.439 --> 22:47.339
we can see every move the jury makes.

22:47.341 --> 22:48.640
I've got an assistant out there

22:48.642 --> 22:51.437
scouring the 99 Cents
Stores as we speak.

22:52.813 --> 22:54.346
Clearly you're not in the mood
for sophisticated humor.

22:54.348 --> 22:57.049
Well, watch this segue.

22:57.051 --> 22:58.417
I have heard a vicious rumor

22:58.419 --> 23:00.819
that the prosecution is
gonna provide us with a copy

23:00.821 --> 23:03.455
of the 911 call that tipped off the DEA

23:03.457 --> 23:06.291
that the drugs were at Cecilia's
house in the first place.

23:06.293 --> 23:09.395
There it is.

23:09.397 --> 23:11.573
All rise.

23:11.598 --> 23:13.631
Show time. I have so much to tell you,

23:13.633 --> 23:14.573
but it'll just have to wait.

23:14.575 --> 23:15.679
The way you run off at the mouth,

23:15.681 --> 23:17.681
I can't get a word in edgewise.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.597
The Baski cartel.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.190
They are new, man.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.924
Croatian, I think.

23:22.926 --> 23:24.492
Yeah, they have a small distro network,

23:24.494 --> 23:26.294
but they are aggressive and ruthless.

23:26.296 --> 23:28.263
Like, whatever it takes
to get a foothold, you know?

23:28.265 --> 23:30.965
So what do you know about
their turf war with Silens?

23:30.967 --> 23:34.202
You know what "Silens" means?

23:34.204 --> 23:35.770
It's Haitian French for "silence."

23:35.772 --> 23:37.639
And that's how they want to keep it.

23:37.641 --> 23:39.607
They don't want any undo attention.

23:39.609 --> 23:41.403
That doesn't make any sense.

23:41.845 --> 23:44.012
You don't plant drugs at your
competitor's sister's house

23:44.014 --> 23:45.947
because you don't want to make noise.

23:48.994 --> 23:52.554
Excuse me. You're... shrugging.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.423
We just paid you $5,000
and you're shrugging.

23:55.425 --> 23:57.859
I'm shrugging at what she said.

23:57.861 --> 24:00.428
Except it's not a question. It's a fact.

24:00.430 --> 24:02.864
What? What did I say?

24:03.509 --> 24:05.300
"You don't plant drugs at your
competitor's sister's house

24:05.302 --> 24:07.001
if you don't want to make noise"?

24:08.364 --> 24:09.971
But the drugs they found at Cecilia's

24:09.973 --> 24:11.906
have already been traced
back to the Silens.

24:13.310 --> 24:15.310
Okay, now I'm shrugging.

24:15.312 --> 24:17.345
When you trace a stolen item,

24:17.347 --> 24:20.482
it doesn't necessarily
take you to the thief.

24:20.484 --> 24:22.917
Sometimes, take you back

24:22.919 --> 24:26.154
to the person from whom it was stolen.

24:26.699 --> 24:29.057
Okay, so... you're saying

24:29.059 --> 24:32.160
that the kilos were stolen from Silens?

24:32.955 --> 24:34.996
I'm not saying anything.

24:34.998 --> 24:37.365
Stolen by... who?

24:40.045 --> 24:41.536
Leo?

24:42.214 --> 24:44.406
I'm still not saying anything.

24:44.408 --> 24:47.475
Agent Conrad, what is a cutting agent?

24:47.477 --> 24:48.843
Objection. Relevance.

24:48.845 --> 24:50.178
Overruled.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.913
A substance used to dilute a narcotic

24:51.915 --> 24:54.082
so the dealer can double
or triple the profit.

24:54.084 --> 24:56.184
And when you executed
your search warrant

24:56.186 --> 24:58.219
at the defendant's home,
did you find anything

24:58.221 --> 25:00.588
you suspect could have been used
as a cutting agent?

25:00.590 --> 25:03.057
I certainly did.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.301
Powdered milk?

25:13.303 --> 25:15.136
Your Honor, either it's snack time,

25:15.138 --> 25:16.704
or we have a discovery violation.

25:16.706 --> 25:19.240
It was listed
in the search warrant returns.

25:19.242 --> 25:20.508
I'll allow it.

25:25.132 --> 25:27.081
Talk to me. Tell me something.

25:27.083 --> 25:31.019
Well, there's not a lot to say.

25:31.021 --> 25:34.556
Agent Conrad, where did you find
these packages of powdered milk?

25:34.558 --> 25:37.158
In a shed...
behind the defendant's home.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.994
Objection. That shed
is my client's office.

25:39.996 --> 25:41.229
Again, relevance?

25:41.231 --> 25:43.665
It shows knowledge and forethought

25:43.667 --> 25:46.401
and suggests intent with regard
to hiding the contraband.

25:46.403 --> 25:48.572
I'll allow it.

25:50.807 --> 25:52.659
Your witness.

25:54.244 --> 25:56.711
Okay, I don't know if it means anything,

25:56.713 --> 25:59.581
but the mirror jurors
love this DEA agent.

25:59.583 --> 26:02.817
Okay, just between us, how close
do you think our mirrors are

26:02.819 --> 26:04.252
to the actual jurors?

26:04.254 --> 26:05.881
Well...

26:06.389 --> 26:07.883
they're all people.

26:09.134 --> 26:10.325
Fantastic.

26:10.327 --> 26:12.060
Good morning, Agent Conrad.

26:12.062 --> 26:14.762
Ever heard the expression,
"When you're a hammer,

26:14.764 --> 26:16.631
everything looks like a nail"?

26:16.633 --> 26:17.899
Yeah, but...

26:17.901 --> 26:18.933
Let me help you.

26:18.935 --> 26:21.970
In addition to powdered milk,

26:21.972 --> 26:24.339
what else did you find
in Ms. Novak's office?

26:24.341 --> 26:26.140
I don't know, papers, furniture,

26:26.142 --> 26:28.910
some kitchen items,
I don't recall exactly.

26:28.912 --> 26:30.945
Paper plates in bulk?

26:30.947 --> 26:32.180
Yes.

26:32.182 --> 26:34.582
Plastic utensils in bulk?

26:34.584 --> 26:35.583
I believe so.

26:35.585 --> 26:38.186
Individually wrapped hand wipes?

26:38.188 --> 26:39.821
Yes, I do recall that.

26:39.823 --> 26:41.689
Are you aware, Agent Conrad,

26:41.691 --> 26:43.024
that Ms. Novak

26:43.026 --> 26:47.095
spends her weekends delivering
food to invalids and shutins?

26:47.097 --> 26:48.696
No, I'm not.

26:48.698 --> 26:50.365
But drug dealers are notorious

26:50.367 --> 26:51.933
for covering their criminal activity

26:51.935 --> 26:54.346
with volunteer work
to throw us off the scent.

26:54.804 --> 26:56.304
Powdered milk is a cutting agent.

26:57.015 --> 26:58.475
True.

26:58.942 --> 27:03.278
But it's also... powdered milk.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.354
No further questions, Your Honor.

27:07.356 --> 27:09.817
I'm hoping J.P. just put
some points on the board.

27:09.819 --> 27:11.452
Yep, on our board.

27:11.454 --> 27:14.366
On the real board, who knows?

27:15.358 --> 27:17.992
From my vantage point,
we're in some real trouble.

27:18.662 --> 27:22.964
I think... we have to
change the narrative.

27:22.966 --> 27:25.800
If I were calling the plays,
I'd start going after Silens.

27:25.802 --> 27:26.901
Hard.

27:28.138 --> 27:29.823
Go after them how?

27:29.825 --> 27:33.041
The idea that Silens planted those drugs

27:33.043 --> 27:35.610
is a theory, and one
we can't prove right now.

27:35.612 --> 27:37.478
You put it out there and don't deliver,

27:37.480 --> 27:39.480
it's game over,
you've lost that jury forever.

27:39.482 --> 27:40.815
What do you know about the jury?

27:40.817 --> 27:41.849
You can't even see them.

27:42.223 --> 27:43.308
He doesn't have to see them

27:43.310 --> 27:44.519
to know when an argument is weak,

27:44.521 --> 27:46.148
and neither do I.

27:46.690 --> 27:49.090
I'm gonna try and stall another day.

27:49.092 --> 27:51.359
Hope something comes back
on that recording

27:51.361 --> 27:53.321
or one of the other leads
we've been chasing down.

27:53.930 --> 27:55.563
Excuse me.

27:55.565 --> 27:58.032
Can I steal you for a second?

27:58.034 --> 28:00.368
Okay, what's going on?

28:00.370 --> 28:01.669
I had that tape analyzed.

28:01.671 --> 28:03.371
I think we need to see Cecilia.

28:03.373 --> 28:05.167
Now.

28:06.042 --> 28:07.475
Okay.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.210
Did you talk to Danny and Benny?

28:09.212 --> 28:10.645
No, not yet, not today.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.047
Well, I'll fill you in in the car.

28:15.719 --> 28:17.452
Come in. What's so urgent?

28:19.589 --> 28:21.289
There are lots of packages.

28:21.291 --> 28:22.457
They're under the deck.

28:22.459 --> 28:23.925
They were put there yesterday.

28:23.927 --> 28:25.689
5387 Fremont Street.

28:25.691 --> 28:27.528
You know who did it.

28:29.566 --> 28:32.166
- Okay...
- That's your son.

28:32.168 --> 28:33.167
That's Peter.

28:33.169 --> 28:36.337
No, it isn't.

28:36.339 --> 28:38.617
Yeah, it is.

28:39.242 --> 28:41.042
We had the tape analyzed.

28:41.044 --> 28:43.044
The voiceprint belongs to a young boy.

28:43.872 --> 28:46.314
We were thinking he used
one of the burner phones

28:46.316 --> 28:47.882
lying around his uncle's house.

28:47.884 --> 28:50.462
Ran it through a voice distortion app.

28:51.254 --> 28:52.854
He's a smart little guy.

28:53.173 --> 28:56.335
And I'm fairly certain he knows
who put those drugs there.

28:56.337 --> 29:00.928
And it wasn't anyone from... Silens.

29:09.456 --> 29:12.376
It's pretty clear Peter
made the call to protect you.

29:13.402 --> 29:14.643
He saw uncle hide those drugs

29:14.645 --> 29:18.865
and he was afraid that
you were gonna get in trouble.

29:19.249 --> 29:21.243
Maybe even killed.

29:22.844 --> 29:25.220
You told me that your brother
made you a promise:

29:25.222 --> 29:28.756
No trouble would make
its way into your home.

29:28.758 --> 29:30.377
Well...

29:30.977 --> 29:34.111
I'm here to tell you
he broke his promise.

29:34.113 --> 29:36.213
To you and your son.

29:36.215 --> 29:37.676
Stop.

29:40.687 --> 29:42.586
You're still willing
to go to jail for him?

29:46.259 --> 29:49.093
And who's gonna watch Peter
while he's growing up?

29:49.095 --> 29:51.106
Who's gonna take care of him?

29:52.532 --> 29:53.898
His uncle?

30:00.173 --> 30:01.992
If I say yes...

30:03.876 --> 30:06.043
if I'm willing to turn...

30:09.348 --> 30:11.649
how does it work?

30:16.923 --> 30:19.390
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you.

30:21.052 --> 30:23.694
Was just sitting here
listening to the ocean.

30:23.696 --> 30:24.662
No problem.

30:24.664 --> 30:27.768
<i>Mi ocean es su ocean.</i>

30:28.551 --> 30:31.769
Do you happen to remember
the last thing you said to me

30:31.771 --> 30:33.938
when you left me by the pool with Gary?

30:34.807 --> 30:36.318
That's...

30:37.343 --> 30:39.110
"I'll be right back."

30:40.847 --> 30:42.166
Yeah.

30:42.191 --> 30:43.256
Well, here I am.

30:43.281 --> 30:44.534
Here we are.

30:47.253 --> 30:49.122
And what did you find out?

30:49.322 --> 30:51.021
The 911 call?

30:52.191 --> 30:55.159
Well, it appears to have
come from an airport payphone.

30:55.161 --> 30:58.529
Englishspeaking male,
with a middleAmerican accent.

30:58.531 --> 31:00.498
So we have narrowed it down to,
what did we say?

31:00.500 --> 31:02.600
47, 48 million people.

31:04.771 --> 31:07.738
And what about our $5,000 source?

31:09.876 --> 31:12.643
It's hard not to become cynical.

31:12.645 --> 31:15.546
Took the money and we got nothing.

31:15.548 --> 31:17.615
I have a call into the
Better Business Bureau.

31:17.617 --> 31:20.946
They have me on hold,
but I'm keeping a good thought.

31:28.327 --> 31:30.706
I'm depending on you, Mr. Bull.

31:31.397 --> 31:34.126
I am all the way out there on this.

31:34.851 --> 31:39.420
Me, Cecilia, and her little boy.

31:40.289 --> 31:41.956
I'm certainly here for you.

31:41.958 --> 31:43.677
Are you?

31:48.731 --> 31:53.478
I know I said that this was
gonna be a kind of... ending,

31:54.103 --> 31:56.337
and I know we've had our disagreements,

31:56.339 --> 31:57.805
and I know that you felt strongly

31:57.807 --> 31:59.507
that I should be encouraging Cecilia

31:59.509 --> 32:02.154
to betray her brother and take a deal.

32:02.612 --> 32:05.045
And if I thought for a second
that I or anyone else

32:05.047 --> 32:06.380
could convince her to do that...

32:06.382 --> 32:07.782
We don't have to go into this.

32:07.784 --> 32:11.204
You've been... very clear.

32:11.754 --> 32:13.999
This is a battle
we have to win in court.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.056
And that's why I'm here.

32:17.294 --> 32:18.659
Are you really?

32:19.713 --> 32:21.798
There's that face again.

32:24.467 --> 32:26.511
You need to trust me.

32:27.429 --> 32:31.138
Now, we should all get some rest.

32:31.140 --> 32:34.375
We've got court tomorrow morning.

32:39.182 --> 32:41.276
Trust me.

32:50.693 --> 32:51.992
Wake up the whole crew,

32:51.994 --> 32:54.428
tell them to meet me down at the beach.

32:58.168 --> 33:01.129
Cecilia's agreed to testify
against her brother.

33:01.671 --> 33:04.138
I've already gotten assurances
that if Cecilia talks,

33:04.140 --> 33:07.007
the government will drop
all charges against her.

33:07.009 --> 33:09.476
Well, wait a minute, what happens next?

33:09.478 --> 33:11.745
The second Leo hears
that she's making a deal,

33:11.747 --> 33:13.047
he'll have her killed.

33:13.049 --> 33:16.250
Well, that's why
I'm talking to you all here.

33:16.252 --> 33:18.727
Now, I have an idea.

33:18.729 --> 33:20.354
It's a little out there,
but if it works,

33:20.356 --> 33:21.856
Cecilia won't go to jail,

33:21.858 --> 33:23.290
and her brother will,

33:23.292 --> 33:25.726
and it'll all happen within
minutes of each other.

33:25.728 --> 33:27.061
And one more thing.

33:27.781 --> 33:31.443
No one can tell J.P.
or anyone on her team

33:31.868 --> 33:33.804
anything about this.

33:35.238 --> 33:36.637
Your Honor.

33:36.639 --> 33:41.575
Apologize for shanghaiing you on
a, beautiful day like this,

33:41.577 --> 33:43.744
but we want to draw your attention

33:43.746 --> 33:45.079
to a growing conflict of interest

33:45.081 --> 33:48.182
between our client Cecilia Novak
and her brother Leo Novak.

33:48.184 --> 33:49.216
I don't understand.

33:49.218 --> 33:50.384
Well, Cecilia and Leo

33:50.386 --> 33:52.419
are represented by the same law firm.

33:52.421 --> 33:53.554
Reed, Straus and Nunnelly.

33:54.724 --> 33:56.624
What is it you're proposing we do?

33:56.626 --> 33:59.793
Well, with your permission,
Ms. Novak has authorized.

33:59.795 --> 34:02.563
Mr. Colรณn and myself
to act as her shadow counsel.

34:02.565 --> 34:03.631
"Shadow counsel"?

34:03.633 --> 34:04.765
Yes, Your Honor.

34:04.767 --> 34:05.733
She has empowered us

34:05.735 --> 34:07.801
to negotiate with the government

34:07.803 --> 34:09.469
in secret, on her behalf.

34:09.472 --> 34:11.906
In return for a testimony
about a heroin shipment

34:11.908 --> 34:13.908
she overheard her brother
Leo discussing,

34:13.909 --> 34:15.943
all charges will
be dropped against Cecilia.

34:16.413 --> 34:17.844
And you're on board with this?

34:17.847 --> 34:19.179
I am.

34:19.181 --> 34:20.668
- Is this true?
- Yeah...

34:20.670 --> 34:22.983
You agree to cooperate
with the government?

34:22.985 --> 34:24.629
Yes, Your Honor.

34:25.054 --> 34:26.085
All right, then.

34:26.088 --> 34:27.420
Let's hurry and get back to court

34:27.422 --> 34:28.856
so I can suspend the trial.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.083
Actually, it's a little bit
more complicated than that.

34:31.085 --> 34:32.592
Um, with your permission,

34:32.594 --> 34:34.929
I'd like Cecilia
to go back into the courtroom

34:34.931 --> 34:36.597
before anyone notices anything.

34:37.434 --> 34:38.565
Fine.

34:39.936 --> 34:42.069
It's okay.

34:45.317 --> 34:48.074
We feel strongly Ms. Novak's
life would be in danger

34:48.077 --> 34:51.045
if her brother Leo
or Ms. Nunnelly's law firm

34:51.047 --> 34:53.246
were to become aware of her
cooperating with the government.

34:53.248 --> 34:54.815
That's what the Witness
Protection Program is for.

34:54.817 --> 34:57.184
Well, she's not interested in
the Witness Protection Program.

34:57.186 --> 34:58.719
She wants to stay here in Miami;

34:58.721 --> 35:01.188
She feels it's in
the best interest of her son.

35:01.190 --> 35:03.891
It's also a condition
of her cooperation.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.459
Well, I don't see how that's possible.

35:05.461 --> 35:06.860
It is.

35:06.862 --> 35:09.096
And the U.S. Attorney's Office is game,

35:09.507 --> 35:11.865
if you'll entertain
just one piece of theatre

35:11.867 --> 35:14.601
to guarantee Cecilia's freedom.

35:24.146 --> 35:25.746
Morning, ladies.

35:25.748 --> 35:28.749
We have a special friend joining us.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.751
Wow. You're unbelievable.

35:30.753 --> 35:33.153
You're late, your client's
world's about to end,

35:33.155 --> 35:35.155
and you're, you're smiling?

35:35.157 --> 35:36.490
What are you taking?

35:38.961 --> 35:41.623
I just feel like
it's gonna be a great day.

35:42.832 --> 35:44.031
<i>Upon serving the warrant</i>

35:44.033 --> 35:45.366
and executing the search,

35:45.368 --> 35:48.402
it is my responsibility to
record and log the contraband.

35:48.404 --> 35:49.503
The heroin.

35:49.505 --> 35:51.105
Objection. Witness is speculating

35:51.107 --> 35:53.640
as to the contents
of the seized packages.

35:53.642 --> 35:55.576
Your Honor, counsel knows very well

35:55.578 --> 35:58.746
that we're in possession of and
prepared to enter into evidence

35:58.748 --> 36:02.145
a certificate of analysis
that will certify

36:02.147 --> 36:04.251
that the seized packages all contain

36:04.253 --> 36:05.986
morphine derivative heroin.

36:05.988 --> 36:08.358
Well, then, let's get on with it.

36:09.291 --> 36:10.891
Your Honor,
the People offer into evidence

36:10.893 --> 36:12.359
this certificate of analysis

36:12.361 --> 36:14.762
of the heroin
found on Ms. Novak's property.

36:14.764 --> 36:17.596
This establishes the final element

36:17.598 --> 36:19.566
in our caseinchief.

36:31.347 --> 36:33.466
Enter away.

36:41.975 --> 36:43.810
So accepted.

36:43.812 --> 36:45.392
Your Honor, thank you.

36:45.394 --> 36:47.313
The prosecution rests.

36:48.314 --> 36:49.496
Your defense.

36:50.191 --> 36:51.698
Thank you, Counselor.

36:53.702 --> 36:56.303
May I see the certificate again?

37:00.702 --> 37:01.842
Thank you.

37:13.122 --> 37:15.489
Why are you stalling?

37:24.200 --> 37:26.400
Last page.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.070
It's not notarized.

37:30.072 --> 37:32.005
The certificate's not notarized.

37:34.877 --> 37:37.945
Your Honor, there is a
fatal flaw in this certificate.

37:37.947 --> 37:40.881
The last page isn't notarized.

37:40.883 --> 37:42.702
What?

37:43.686 --> 37:45.018
The government can only prove

37:45.020 --> 37:48.088
that the substance is in fact
heroin if every page

37:48.090 --> 37:49.823
has been notarized.

37:49.825 --> 37:51.191
They've failed to do this.

37:51.193 --> 37:52.392
We move to exclude it.

37:52.394 --> 37:53.845
Wait, wait a second.

37:53.847 --> 37:55.963
One page of notarization. One page?

37:55.965 --> 37:58.665
Come on, I mean, tthe pages
probably stuck together.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.501
That's a technicality, Your Honor.

38:00.503 --> 38:03.170
There's a notary down the hall,
II'll go out and find one

38:03.172 --> 38:05.873
- in two seconds, I'll...
- Prosecution rested its case.

38:05.875 --> 38:09.143
<i>You rested your case.</i>

38:09.562 --> 38:11.445
It's too late now, and you know it.

38:11.447 --> 38:13.147
The door's closed.

38:13.149 --> 38:16.917
Your Honor, our whole case
depends on that certificate.

38:16.919 --> 38:20.587
It proves that the bricks
in Ms. Novak's home were heroin.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.823
Well, then,
you should've doublechecked it,

38:22.825 --> 38:24.619
shouldn't you?

38:25.194 --> 38:27.294
Your Honor, as the government
has just admitted,

38:27.296 --> 38:30.291
without the certificate,
they have no case.

38:30.959 --> 38:33.800
I move for a directed verdict.

38:35.421 --> 38:37.004
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

38:37.006 --> 38:38.739
thank you for your service.

38:38.741 --> 38:41.833
Motion for a directed verdict
is granted.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.744
I am finding the defendant

38:43.746 --> 38:45.709
not guilty on all charges.

38:45.711 --> 38:48.601
Ms. Novak, you are free to go.

39:04.567 --> 39:08.402
So, how does it feel, Counselor,
to lose your biggest case?

39:08.404 --> 39:11.905
You know how it is.
Win some, lose some.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.450
What the hell just happened?

39:23.452 --> 39:25.026
You're asking me?

39:25.028 --> 39:26.119
I have no idea.

39:26.121 --> 39:27.654
But you won.

39:27.656 --> 39:30.324
You won it all, you got
everything you wanted.

39:30.326 --> 39:32.559
Yes, I did, didn't I?

39:32.561 --> 39:35.996
Hey, do you still
have those papers,

39:35.998 --> 39:38.065
the ones that allow
you to leave the firm?

39:38.067 --> 39:40.500
What? Yeah.

39:41.237 --> 39:43.437
You should have Gary sign those.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.409
There she is, buddy.

39:49.411 --> 39:50.711
Go get her. Mom!

39:52.560 --> 39:53.926
Peter?

39:56.352 --> 39:58.318
You did the right thing.

39:58.713 --> 40:00.487
I'm glad you made the call.

40:02.424 --> 40:04.761
I'm so proud of you.

40:07.805 --> 40:10.097
Told you I'd take care of you, sis.

40:16.138 --> 40:18.338
Leo Novak.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.844
You're under arrest.

40:43.165 --> 40:44.865
Wow.

40:44.867 --> 40:48.268
Your biggest client, under arrest.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.270
Can't be good for business.

40:50.272 --> 40:53.407
Wait a second,
he's not your client anymore.

40:54.352 --> 40:57.021
Good thing you got him
to sign those papers.

40:58.314 --> 40:59.846
Good thing.

41:00.817 --> 41:02.382
Well.

41:02.777 --> 41:04.362
I got to go.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.554
You should go celebrate.

41:07.556 --> 41:09.890
You've changed a lot of lives today.

41:25.883 --> 41:27.874
You lied to me.

41:30.212 --> 41:32.974
You misled me.

41:33.949 --> 41:35.435
Morning.

41:36.853 --> 41:38.852
You deceived me.

41:43.693 --> 41:45.525
Thank you.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.628
I told you to trust me.

41:51.200 --> 41:52.952
What time's your flight?

41:53.953 --> 41:57.738
Three hours after checkout, of course.

41:57.740 --> 41:59.506
Pretty small of Leo
not to lend us his plane

41:59.508 --> 42:00.874
after we got him arrested.

42:01.210 --> 42:04.047
People. Always disappointing me.

42:09.469 --> 42:11.585
There's my ride.

42:11.587 --> 42:14.354
Wow. Well.

42:14.356 --> 42:16.790
You've got a busy schedule.

42:18.019 --> 42:20.073
Looking for new office space,

42:20.813 --> 42:22.863
getting stationery.

42:26.268 --> 42:28.168
I don't know what to do with you.

42:28.946 --> 42:31.037
Well, I can think of a few things,

42:31.039 --> 42:33.951
but you don't want to hear them.

42:37.830 --> 42:39.846
Later, gator.

42:45.154 --> 42:47.521
In a while, crocodile.
