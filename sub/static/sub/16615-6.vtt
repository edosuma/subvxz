<i>Previously on "Once
Upon a Time"...</i>

00:02.461 --> 00:05.194
In the vision... I die.

00:05.219 --> 00:06.989
All saviors die.

00:07.014 --> 00:08.443
Is there any way to change it?

00:08.468 --> 00:11.927
These shears can sever the
ties to your own destiny.

00:11.952 --> 00:13.999
Aladdin didn't trust
the people he loved.

00:14.024 --> 00:15.491
That's why he failed.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.834
Take them.

00:19.267 --> 00:21.535
We need to be sure to be rid of them.

00:27.790 --> 00:30.422
_

00:31.746 --> 00:33.380
Bring her about, men!

00:33.414 --> 00:36.049
Look alive! Pick up the pace!

00:36.083 --> 00:38.852
Mr. Smee wouldn't have stood for this.

00:38.886 --> 00:41.621
<i>Jolly Roger</i> is the
fastest ship in the realm.

00:41.656 --> 00:43.189
[Slaps rail] Hey!

00:44.043 --> 00:47.545
So why does it have the slowest crew?!

00:47.929 --> 00:51.998
- They're tired.
- Who dares defy me?

00:54.468 --> 00:55.936
I do.

00:56.571 --> 00:59.072
Appears we have a stowaway.

01:06.904 --> 01:09.210
Who are you, and how did
you get aboard my ship?

01:09.244 --> 01:13.281
I am... no one.

01:13.315 --> 01:14.849
[Chuckles] Right.

01:14.883 --> 01:18.591
Just a man who's come to
ask you one simple question.

01:18.616 --> 01:21.088
Aye, well... better make it a good one

01:21.123 --> 01:23.190
'cause it's gonna be your last.

01:23.225 --> 01:26.761
Is getting revenge against the Dark One

01:26.795 --> 01:30.464
worth all the time
you've spent chasing it?

01:30.499 --> 01:33.267
I'll let you know after I've
skinned myself a crocodile,

01:33.302 --> 01:36.203
but first...

01:36.238 --> 01:38.845
I'll just have to settle for you.

01:38.870 --> 01:42.276
Man: Narwhale! Starboard bow!

01:42.311 --> 01:43.544
Don't move.

01:43.579 --> 01:46.113
[Shouting continues]

01:52.287 --> 01:53.902
Sea monster!

01:53.927 --> 01:55.865
Man the cannons! Bring her about!

01:55.890 --> 01:57.042
On the double!

02:03.799 --> 02:05.299
That's impossible.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.602
I assure you it's quite possible.

02:07.636 --> 02:08.669
That's no sea monster.

02:08.704 --> 02:11.117
What does that mean? What
the devil are you up to?

02:11.148 --> 02:12.458

02:59.655 --> 03:01.992
Your Majesty.

03:02.017 --> 03:05.886
Come out. We need to have a little chat.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.005
Or what?

03:10.094 --> 03:13.943
You'll huff, and you'll puff,

03:13.968 --> 03:16.269
and you'll blow the house down?

03:16.562 --> 03:18.629
[Chuckles evilly]

03:18.654 --> 03:21.622
You call <i>this</i>
an entrance, Regina?

03:21.647 --> 03:24.482
Well, I suppose I was the
one with all the flair.

03:26.102 --> 03:28.337
To what do we owe the honor?

03:28.362 --> 03:29.329
So, it's true.

03:29.789 --> 03:33.387
You really are harboring
the Evil Queen out here.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.687
She's my sister, and she cares about me.

03:35.712 --> 03:38.059
I'm willing to bet you're not
here to see how I'm getting on.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.519
You're right. I have a message.

03:41.779 --> 03:45.548
Your little masquerade
as the Cricket therapist

03:45.583 --> 03:47.216
didn't work

03:47.251 --> 03:50.572
because airing Emma's dirty
laundry only made us stronger.

03:50.597 --> 03:51.993
Evil Queen: Well, then
why are you out here

03:52.025 --> 03:55.935
delivering this message
all by your lonesome? Hmm?

03:55.967 --> 03:58.902
[Sighs] We're right behind you.

03:58.929 --> 04:02.131
[Cricket chirping]

[Sighs]

04:04.835 --> 04:07.470
[Baby coos]

04:07.504 --> 04:13.142
I don't think you came
all this way just to gloat.

04:13.177 --> 04:15.278
That's <i>my</i> move.

04:17.447 --> 04:19.983
You're up to something else.

04:20.017 --> 04:22.218
[Baby crying]

04:26.293 --> 04:27.590
Stay away from her!

04:27.625 --> 04:29.317
We just came for Archie.

04:29.342 --> 04:31.597
We're not here to hurt your daughter.

04:31.622 --> 04:34.056
Well, excuse me for
not taking any chances.

04:35.956 --> 04:37.423
Thanks, sis.

04:37.701 --> 04:40.637
And now the <i>real</i> fun can begin.

04:46.359 --> 04:48.527
How's <i>that</i> for an entrance?

04:50.428 --> 04:52.228
Try all you want,

04:52.278 --> 04:55.423
but nothing you do will
ever tear this family apart.

04:55.448 --> 04:57.306
Oh, is that so?

04:57.573 --> 05:01.342
Because exposing Emma's
secret was just the beginning.

05:01.390 --> 05:03.491
Bring it, Queenie.

05:08.483 --> 05:10.284
Aladdin: Well, there's
no flying carpets,

05:10.319 --> 05:12.653
but Storybrooke's not too bad.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.589
Well, I'm glad you found a place.

05:16.992 --> 05:20.068
But... Aladdin...

05:20.093 --> 05:22.770
we haven't talked about
what really matters...

05:24.228 --> 05:25.628
Agrabah.

05:25.663 --> 05:28.164
Well [clears throat]

05:28.198 --> 05:30.442
It still needs your help.

05:30.467 --> 05:33.802
I told you, I'm not the Savior anymore.

05:33.975 --> 05:34.952
I cut my ties.

05:34.977 --> 05:37.412
But you can still help your people.

05:37.437 --> 05:38.284
You don't even know what happened...

05:38.309 --> 05:39.809
[Sharply] It doesn't matter.

05:44.014 --> 05:47.016
This was a bad idea. Yeah.

05:48.387 --> 05:50.317
I'm not the guy you're looking for.

05:50.342 --> 05:52.710
Aladdin... wait!

05:55.147 --> 05:56.347
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:56.382 --> 05:58.082
You were up awfully early this morning.

05:58.117 --> 05:59.584
What were you doing out in the garage?

05:59.618 --> 06:02.187
Uh... I was just doing
a little gardening.

06:02.958 --> 06:03.688
Really?

06:03.722 --> 06:06.424
I had no idea you had a... green hook.

06:08.127 --> 06:11.196
So, what's for breakfast?

06:11.230 --> 06:13.698
[Cellphone vibrates]

06:14.037 --> 06:15.304
It's Jasmine.

06:15.985 --> 06:17.702
She's worried because Aladdin ran off,

06:17.727 --> 06:19.504
and she doesn't know where he is.

06:19.538 --> 06:20.354
Don't worry, Swan.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.916
I'll make sure Aladdin doesn't
get into too much trouble.

06:22.941 --> 06:24.208
Thanks, Killian.

06:28.147 --> 06:30.281
So, now.

06:30.316 --> 06:32.183
You know, you don't have to stay.

06:32.218 --> 06:33.235
I'll be fine on my own.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.281
No, no, no, no. Nonsense.

06:34.306 --> 06:37.646
You can show me how to operate
the helm of your video... box.

06:37.671 --> 06:39.435
Whatever it's called.

06:40.107 --> 06:41.069
Um, okay.

06:41.094 --> 06:42.571
First, just let me take out the trash.

06:42.596 --> 06:43.305
Well, that's a good idea.

06:43.330 --> 06:44.711
Actually, you can start
with this junk food

06:44.742 --> 06:46.443
you call breakfast.

06:46.501 --> 06:50.088
You're not really gonna
eat this rubbish, are you?

06:50.113 --> 06:51.747
My Pop Tarts!

06:52.277 --> 06:54.525
Hurry back, and I'll make
us a pirate's breakfast

06:54.550 --> 06:56.953
of grapefruit and boiled mackerel.

06:56.978 --> 06:59.279
There'll be no scurvy here today.

07:03.351 --> 07:04.284
[Sighs]

07:08.059 --> 07:10.393
I know what you're thinking...

07:10.428 --> 07:14.531
"How long before that
pirate ruins everything?"

07:14.565 --> 07:16.233
What are you doing here?

07:16.267 --> 07:18.802
Looking out for my son.

07:18.836 --> 07:20.850
Tell me...

07:20.875 --> 07:22.249
is your new father bothering you?

07:22.274 --> 07:23.475
He's not my father.

07:23.642 --> 07:27.111
Well, it's just a matter of time.

07:29.395 --> 07:31.796
Henry, I'm just trying to help.

07:33.093 --> 07:35.039
Now, I know how difficult it is

07:35.064 --> 07:36.797
when someone new joins the family.

07:36.822 --> 07:37.814
How would you know?

07:37.865 --> 07:39.566
Because I used to be that person.

07:39.591 --> 07:42.459
But he's not like you. He
would never hurt this family.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.870
Is that so?

07:43.904 --> 07:45.004
Yeah.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.473
[Whoosh]

07:47.508 --> 07:48.875
[Doors creak]

07:48.909 --> 07:49.642
[Whoosh]

07:49.677 --> 07:51.177
[Clatter]

07:51.212 --> 07:52.679
Oops.

08:11.936 --> 08:13.036
He kept them.

08:13.061 --> 08:19.233
The one thing that can take
away what makes Emma special.

08:20.127 --> 08:21.394
You're not taking these.

08:21.428 --> 08:23.162
Oh, I don't want them, Henry.

08:23.197 --> 08:26.265
I want to make sure you learn the truth

08:26.300 --> 08:29.101
about dear-old Dad-to-be.

08:29.136 --> 08:32.938
He doesn't care about you or Emma.

08:32.972 --> 08:36.909
So now you have to ask yourself

08:36.943 --> 08:40.613
one tiny question...

08:41.106 --> 08:43.707
what are you going to do about it?

09:06.282 --> 09:08.283
Really?

09:09.072 --> 09:11.306
Emma, this is not what it looks like.

09:11.331 --> 09:13.648
- This is my new car.
- Oh, really?

09:13.664 --> 09:15.799
So you traded in your
flying carpet for a Miata?

09:15.833 --> 09:17.841
- Yeah, it gets great mileage.
- Sure, right.

09:17.866 --> 09:19.533
Let's take a drive. We need to talk.

09:19.704 --> 09:21.404
Jasmine sent you.

09:21.439 --> 09:22.630
Sorry, not in the mood.

09:22.655 --> 09:24.756
I wasn't asking.

09:26.444 --> 09:29.859
Henry, they clearly
didn't design these things

09:29.884 --> 09:30.750
for people like m...

09:35.119 --> 09:36.620
Henry?

09:56.504 --> 09:57.937
Bloody hell.

10:04.011 --> 10:06.279
[Groans, coughs]

10:10.251 --> 10:12.852
Welcome aboard, mate.

10:27.225 --> 10:29.159
Where the devil am I?

10:35.024 --> 10:38.127
What kind of dark magic is this?

10:38.152 --> 10:40.286
Not magic. You're aboard my ship.

10:40.637 --> 10:43.338
You're no many fathoms under the sea.

10:43.373 --> 10:45.007
Welcome to the Nautilus.

10:48.207 --> 10:51.309
Call me... Nemo.

10:51.343 --> 10:53.244
What do you want?

10:59.813 --> 11:05.518
This ship is much more
than steel and rivets.

11:06.538 --> 11:10.174
It's a second chance.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.382
Well, you're daft if you
think I'll spend any longer

11:12.407 --> 11:16.043
in this underwater
coffin than I have to.

11:24.702 --> 11:28.872
I know your heart is filled
with hatred, seeking revenge.

11:28.907 --> 11:30.420
This harpoon was enchanted

11:30.445 --> 11:33.581
to help me find wayward
souls like your own.

11:33.878 --> 11:38.015
And then what? Fill it
with something else?

11:38.049 --> 11:39.864
Yes, Hook.

11:39.889 --> 11:40.997
[Chuckles]

11:41.022 --> 11:44.558
With the one thing
missing in your life...

11:47.058 --> 11:48.959
family.

11:52.014 --> 11:53.347
No one...

11:53.382 --> 11:55.917
will ever replace...

11:56.534 --> 11:58.674
what the Dark One took from me.

11:58.699 --> 12:01.340
I know it feels that way now...

12:01.379 --> 12:03.447
You have no idea how it feels!

12:03.481 --> 12:05.349
That's where you're wrong.

12:05.383 --> 12:10.087
You see, I lost a family, too.

12:10.792 --> 12:14.124
They were brutally
murdered while I was at sea.

12:14.159 --> 12:16.727
I spent decades

12:16.761 --> 12:20.564
hunting down the men
responsible for what happened.

12:21.509 --> 12:26.579
I killed one of them
with this very blade.

12:27.005 --> 12:29.940
And when I was finished,

12:29.974 --> 12:34.978
all I was left with was an empty heart

12:35.013 --> 12:36.712
and a bloodstained harpoon.

12:36.737 --> 12:38.486
I don't need a family.

12:38.511 --> 12:40.282
Let me off. Now.

12:40.307 --> 12:42.371
I don't think you have
a choice in this matter.

12:42.396 --> 12:44.563
There's a mission I need your help with.

12:47.741 --> 12:50.810
It's an important one,

12:50.835 --> 12:52.769
and when it's done...

12:54.966 --> 12:59.266
you will see that this ship...

12:59.291 --> 13:02.193
is exactly where you belong.

13:08.887 --> 13:10.687
Henry, what are you doing?

13:10.722 --> 13:12.511
What my mom asked <i>you</i> to do...

13:12.536 --> 13:13.803
getting rid of these.

13:14.025 --> 13:15.459
Let me explain.

13:16.370 --> 13:17.961
You don't have to. I get it.

13:18.284 --> 13:20.732
No, you don't. I kept
them to protect Emma.

13:20.757 --> 13:22.725
Even though she didn't want you to?

13:23.654 --> 13:25.002
Henry, listen to me.

13:25.036 --> 13:25.936
No!

13:25.970 --> 13:27.659
You don't get to make decisions for me,

13:27.684 --> 13:30.562
and you certainly don't get
to make decisions for my mom.

13:31.442 --> 13:33.243
- Henry, stop!
- Let go of me!

13:33.268 --> 13:35.335
This isn't about the
bloody shears right now!

13:37.122 --> 13:40.157
Henry: What the hell is that?

13:43.744 --> 13:44.744
Run.

13:46.724 --> 13:48.859
Turn around, mate.

13:51.062 --> 13:53.197
Captain wants to see you.

13:59.584 --> 14:01.136
Listen to me, just let the lad go.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.193
He's got nothing to do with this!

14:04.409 --> 14:05.664
What the hell is going on?

14:05.690 --> 14:07.057
What does it look like?

14:11.941 --> 14:14.017
- Are we...
- Under water?

14:14.042 --> 14:15.696
Aye.

14:15.844 --> 14:17.311
Welcome to the Nautilus.

14:20.278 --> 14:21.378
[Chuckles lightly]

14:39.222 --> 14:42.023
I-I got here as soon as I could.

14:42.058 --> 14:43.777
I was on patrol out by the mines.

14:43.802 --> 14:45.703
It's just been one crisis after another

14:45.728 --> 14:46.863
ever since that dirigible hit.

14:46.888 --> 14:47.744
I found him in the woods.

14:47.769 --> 14:48.848
Who is he?

14:48.873 --> 14:49.824
He looks like another refugee

14:49.849 --> 14:51.250
from the Land of Untold Stories.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.292
He had serious injuries,
heavy bleeding...

14:54.327 --> 14:56.328
another few hours,
he would've been gone.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.717
He must have been out there for days.

14:57.742 --> 14:58.803
Did anyone recognize him?

14:58.828 --> 15:00.595
No, we're asking around, but...

15:01.067 --> 15:04.369
I don't think he was
ever <i>at</i> Granny's.

15:04.569 --> 15:05.444
You know what?

15:05.469 --> 15:06.416
I'm gonna head back to the station,

15:06.441 --> 15:08.034
see if anyone reported him missing.

15:08.059 --> 15:10.093
Yeah, uh... I'll stay here.
I'll let you know how it goes.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.086
Snow: Belle!

15:22.120 --> 15:23.521
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

15:23.555 --> 15:25.556
Snow, hi.

15:25.590 --> 15:29.560
I'm... getting my first ultrasound.

15:29.594 --> 15:31.409
Wow!

15:31.434 --> 15:32.734
That's so exciting.

15:33.086 --> 15:35.510
Yeah, didn't even tell
Rumple I was coming.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.080
[Breathes deeply]

15:39.394 --> 15:40.818
Well, given what he's put you through,

15:40.843 --> 15:43.464
I don't think anyone would blame you.

15:43.498 --> 15:48.236
Well, it's not... it's not
just about today, though.

15:48.270 --> 15:50.471
I mean, if I don't
want Rumple to be a part

15:50.505 --> 15:52.540
of something as... as simple as this,

15:52.574 --> 15:55.570
what am I gonna do
when the baby gets here?

15:55.595 --> 15:59.765
H-How am I gonna let him ever
be a part of our son's life.

16:02.282 --> 16:06.085
That is a good question.

16:06.119 --> 16:08.159
Well, it's one you don't have to answer

16:08.184 --> 16:10.653
for at least two more trimesters.

16:12.495 --> 16:13.795
Yeah.

16:13.829 --> 16:15.263
[Machinery rumbles]

16:17.196 --> 16:18.396
Why did they grab us?

16:18.421 --> 16:22.191
I'm afraid I have a history
with the captain of this vessel.

16:22.225 --> 16:24.093
Why doesn't that surprise me?

16:24.127 --> 16:25.259
None of this would've happened

16:25.284 --> 16:26.813
if you just did what my mom asked.

16:26.838 --> 16:28.177
Sorry, lad, but I couldn't give up

16:28.202 --> 16:29.603
the one thing that could save her.

16:29.628 --> 16:30.995
When were you gonna use them on her?

16:31.367 --> 16:33.151
Were you even gonna ask before you did?

16:33.176 --> 16:34.675
I don't know! [Sighs]

16:34.700 --> 16:36.820
Being the Savior is who she is.

16:36.845 --> 16:38.345
It's what brought us together.

16:40.219 --> 16:42.387
I wasn't trying to take
that away from you, Henry.

16:42.422 --> 16:44.590
Why do you even care?

16:44.624 --> 16:46.792
You're not even a part of this family.

16:48.895 --> 16:49.895
Henry...

16:49.929 --> 16:52.097
It doesn't matter.

16:52.131 --> 16:53.332
We're just gonna end up fish food

16:53.357 --> 16:54.742
on the ocean floor soon, anyway.

16:55.301 --> 16:57.144
We've gotten out of
tougher scrapes than this.

16:57.169 --> 16:59.304
Remember the W-Walking Prisoner gag?

16:59.349 --> 17:00.816
Wookiee.

17:00.851 --> 17:02.585
Wookiee Prisoner gag.

17:02.619 --> 17:04.954
W-Wookiee?

17:04.988 --> 17:07.183
What's a Wookiee? It
doesn't make any sense.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.175
It's from...

17:09.393 --> 17:11.511
Never mind.

17:11.536 --> 17:13.804
And that doesn't count.

17:15.298 --> 17:16.929
Alternate universe.

17:16.954 --> 17:19.922
Well, I'll just have to come
up with a plan of my own.

17:20.251 --> 17:21.624
Trust me, Henry.

17:21.648 --> 17:23.817
This captain is one fellow
you don't want to meet.

17:47.186 --> 17:49.253
[Panting]

17:49.288 --> 17:51.089
Bloody hell.

17:51.123 --> 17:54.392
These are dangerous waters. Stay close.

17:54.426 --> 17:56.060
Don't step off the path.

17:56.095 --> 17:58.429
What exactly are we after?

17:58.464 --> 18:01.666
You'll see soon enough.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.367
It's up ahead.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.968
You heard the Captain, stay close.

18:13.663 --> 18:17.132
Do you really believe
everything the old man says?

18:17.167 --> 18:20.636
You should listen to him.
You might learn something.

18:20.670 --> 18:24.039
I think the pressure's
getting to all of you.

18:24.073 --> 18:27.142
I'd give my life for that man.

18:27.177 --> 18:30.946
Why? What's he ever done for you?

18:34.651 --> 18:37.753
When I was a child, my
family was taken from me.

18:37.787 --> 18:40.475
I grew up next to the
docks, fending for myself,

18:40.500 --> 18:43.569
desperate to make the
people who took them pay.

18:43.594 --> 18:44.491
[Sighs]

18:44.516 --> 18:47.022
It was only a matter of time
before I got myself killed.

18:47.054 --> 18:50.490
And then what? Nemo kidnapped you?

18:50.524 --> 18:52.826
That man saved my life.

18:52.860 --> 18:54.661
Let me ask you one question.

18:54.695 --> 18:56.162
Your quest for vengeance...

18:56.197 --> 18:58.446
did you ever find those who wronged you?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.704
No, and I'm lucky I didn't.

19:00.729 --> 19:03.998
Then talk to me when
vengeance is in your grasp.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.502
It won't be so easy to give up then.

19:06.527 --> 19:09.396
There it is.

19:17.226 --> 19:19.527
Bloody hell.

19:19.561 --> 19:22.194
All this for hidden treasure.

19:22.277 --> 19:26.980
Aye, but there's more than
gold and jewels in that chest.

19:37.054 --> 19:38.421
[Roaring]

19:38.456 --> 19:40.957
Kraken!

19:40.992 --> 19:42.759
Hold on!

19:46.597 --> 19:48.899
[Roaring continues]

19:49.834 --> 19:51.168
Nemo!

19:54.739 --> 19:56.439
[Roaring intensifies]

19:56.474 --> 19:58.241
Hold on!

19:58.518 --> 20:01.186
- [Groaning]
- [Yells]

20:10.276 --> 20:12.411
[All panting]

20:12.445 --> 20:13.985
I told you to stay close.

20:14.010 --> 20:16.678
[Groaning]

20:17.181 --> 20:18.348
You could've been killed.

20:20.565 --> 20:22.338
You may be stubborn,

20:22.363 --> 20:24.117
but I haven't given up on you yet.

20:24.155 --> 20:27.024
Believe it or not, you're
part of this family.

20:30.001 --> 20:33.188
To what do I owe the pleasure?

20:33.213 --> 20:35.247
It's not every day Rumplestiltskin

20:35.272 --> 20:37.184
makes a house call.

20:37.325 --> 20:38.858
No.

20:38.893 --> 20:41.127
It's not.

20:41.162 --> 20:43.424
I see you're celebrating.

20:43.449 --> 20:46.084
Yes, well... I'm in the midst

20:46.109 --> 20:48.420
of driving a pirate-shaped wedge

20:48.454 --> 20:51.089
into the middle of the Charming clan.

20:54.026 --> 20:55.927
Care to join me.

20:55.962 --> 20:58.830
Do you remember...

20:58.855 --> 21:00.556
your old lessons?

21:01.842 --> 21:04.844
Why, yes, I do.

21:04.870 --> 21:07.405
[Clears throat]

21:07.440 --> 21:10.775
What do you want to
teach me now... teacher?

21:10.810 --> 21:12.496
Well, it seems you have forgotten

21:12.521 --> 21:14.388
the most important lesson of all.

21:15.780 --> 21:18.282
Never take what's mine.

21:20.055 --> 21:22.211
The shears.

21:22.235 --> 21:25.638
The pirate had them hidden,
and now they're gone.

21:25.672 --> 21:27.740
And I could smell
your magic all over it.

21:27.774 --> 21:29.618
<i>You</i> want the shears?

21:29.650 --> 21:30.771
I didn't think you cared

21:30.796 --> 21:32.652
whether or not the Savior met her fate.

21:32.686 --> 21:35.006
You really think the Shears of Destiny

21:35.062 --> 21:36.568
work only on the Savior?

21:38.358 --> 21:41.694
Ohhh.

21:41.728 --> 21:45.831
You want to use them on Belle

21:45.866 --> 21:49.154
and the baby she has brewing inside her

21:49.179 --> 21:53.506
so you can change the fate of
your pathetic little family.

21:54.202 --> 21:58.344
Well, I wish I could help.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.681
But like everyone you've ever loved,

22:01.715 --> 22:04.884
those shears are long gone.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.854
Careful who you cross.

22:09.308 --> 22:10.590
You're thin on allies.

22:10.624 --> 22:15.728
[Chuckles] You don't
need allies when you win.

22:16.588 --> 22:20.900
And as you can see, I'm
doing just fine without you.

22:21.598 --> 22:24.704
We'll see about that, dearie.

22:25.207 --> 22:27.308
We shall see.

22:32.966 --> 22:35.601
[Brakes squeal]

22:35.635 --> 22:36.635
[Engine shuts off]

22:42.055 --> 22:43.938
If this is some kind of nature therapy,

22:43.964 --> 22:46.582
you should know woods
aren't really my thing.

22:46.606 --> 22:48.373
Come on, you'll see.

22:57.842 --> 22:59.877
"Welcome to Storybrooke."

23:00.036 --> 23:01.737
Look closer.

23:01.857 --> 23:03.891
All right.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.268
[Sighs]

23:05.309 --> 23:07.210
So? It's been repaired.

23:07.826 --> 23:09.338
Drunk driver must have hit it.

23:09.373 --> 23:11.656
Well, despite how strongly
Regina spiked her cider,

23:11.681 --> 23:12.681
I was not drunk.

23:14.451 --> 23:15.554
You did this?

23:16.006 --> 23:17.678
Yeah.

23:17.694 --> 23:19.717
I hit the sign right after
Henry tried to convince me

23:19.742 --> 23:21.409
that I was Storybrooke's Savior.

23:23.024 --> 23:24.100
Hang on.

23:24.548 --> 23:27.136
So, you...

23:27.638 --> 23:30.017
you, Emma Swan... you ran.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.474
It wasn't the only time.

23:31.508 --> 23:33.198
When was the last?

23:33.223 --> 23:36.025
Yesterday when you gave me the shears.

23:36.050 --> 23:37.584
But... but you got rid of them.

23:38.091 --> 23:39.229
I told my family I was worried

23:39.254 --> 23:41.255
somebody would use them
as a weapon against me.

23:41.598 --> 23:43.098
That's not true?

23:43.141 --> 23:44.570
I was...

23:45.476 --> 23:47.177
worried that I might use them.

23:48.603 --> 23:51.805
Every time I think about
the vision of my future,

23:51.840 --> 23:55.809
and I think about my
trembling hand and...

23:56.589 --> 24:00.280
imagine my family
having to watch me die.

24:00.315 --> 24:03.976
And I wish I never became the Savior.

24:04.070 --> 24:06.938
So I knew I could not have
that thing anywhere near me.

24:06.973 --> 24:08.240
Tell me.

24:08.877 --> 24:10.442
What do I do now?

24:10.830 --> 24:13.045
What I did all the times I ran...

24:13.079 --> 24:16.175
I came back, faced the
people I disappointed,

24:16.200 --> 24:18.277
and tried to find a way
to make up for my mistakes.

24:19.264 --> 24:20.725
My mistakes.

24:22.488 --> 24:25.849
Whatever happened to Agrabah...

24:25.874 --> 24:27.909
was all my fault.

24:28.102 --> 24:30.503
I don't even know where
to start to fix it.

24:30.538 --> 24:32.719
You don't even know what happened.

24:32.744 --> 24:34.624
Maybe that's where you start.

24:34.649 --> 24:36.950
You can't fix a problem
until you know what it is.

24:54.742 --> 24:56.843
I killed my father.

24:57.698 --> 24:59.346
What?

24:59.573 --> 25:02.166
You asked me why I care about
keeping your family together.

25:02.191 --> 25:05.160
It's because I once had
the chance of having my own.

25:06.313 --> 25:07.699
With your dad?

25:08.234 --> 25:09.532
I know. You told us.

25:09.557 --> 25:12.960
There's a part of the
story I didn't share, Henry.

25:15.365 --> 25:17.633
When I killed my father,

25:18.487 --> 25:22.424
I didn't just destroy his life.

25:24.847 --> 25:26.714
He had a son.

25:30.285 --> 25:32.964
So you had another brother.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.390
Aye.

25:36.642 --> 25:40.244
He named him Liam,
after my older brother.

25:42.147 --> 25:44.282
That was just too much for me.

25:47.228 --> 25:50.330
I killed my father,

25:50.364 --> 25:54.768
and I left an innocent boy an orphan.

26:12.933 --> 26:14.968
All this for a key.

26:15.002 --> 26:17.871
You're even madder than I thought.

26:19.435 --> 26:21.601
This vessel has served as refuge

26:21.626 --> 26:23.994
for people to escape their past,

26:24.124 --> 26:27.160
but this is no place
to build a new life.

26:27.194 --> 26:31.064
All we do is sail and sail
with no place to call home.

26:31.098 --> 26:33.266
Well, how's a key gonna change that?

26:33.300 --> 26:36.433
This isn't just any key.

26:36.656 --> 26:38.958
This key will open the gateway

26:38.992 --> 26:41.541
to a place called...

26:41.566 --> 26:43.868
the Mysterious Island.

26:44.064 --> 26:48.534
It is a place where we can start over.

26:48.568 --> 26:51.203
<i>This</i> is your chance, Killian.

26:51.238 --> 26:55.141
You don't have to swim
the dark waters any longer.

26:55.175 --> 26:58.204
I've spent too long chasing
my Crocodile to give up now.

26:58.229 --> 27:00.891
I know. You've lost people you love.

27:00.922 --> 27:03.358
I know that's why you don't
want to open your heart again,

27:03.383 --> 27:05.787
but what if I told you
that the Mysterious Island

27:05.812 --> 27:10.902
was a place where you never
have to lose anyone again?

27:11.691 --> 27:13.934
No, that's... that's not possible.

27:13.968 --> 27:15.402
It is.

27:15.436 --> 27:17.704
Join my crew.

27:17.739 --> 27:19.106
See for yourself.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.248
That knife... where did you get it?

27:31.319 --> 27:33.720
It belongs to my first mate.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.564
He told me his family
were taken from him... how?

27:38.598 --> 27:41.533
He was a young boy when
his father was murdered

27:41.568 --> 27:43.035
while he slept in his bed.

27:43.069 --> 27:45.437
His name.

27:45.472 --> 27:48.040
What's your first mate's name?

27:48.074 --> 27:49.641
Liam.

27:51.611 --> 27:53.679
[Whoosh]

27:55.819 --> 27:59.188
You're trying to make up for
what you did to Liam with me?

28:00.154 --> 28:02.888
I can't ruin another family, Henry.

28:02.922 --> 28:04.160
You're not going to.

28:04.185 --> 28:06.286
I already have.

28:06.448 --> 28:07.698
We're trapped in this iron tin

28:07.723 --> 28:09.724
when I can't even pick that lock.

28:12.294 --> 28:15.630
You can't, but maybe I can.

28:20.237 --> 28:23.339
First rule of kidnapping...
they never search the kid.

28:27.429 --> 28:28.363
[Door thuds]

28:28.397 --> 28:29.897
We're going through there?

28:29.932 --> 28:31.466
[Sighs] It's the only way off.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.696
Hurry. We don't have much time

28:33.721 --> 28:36.323
before the captain
realizes that we've escaped.

28:39.775 --> 28:41.330
What'd you do to him?

28:41.377 --> 28:42.705
Why is Nemo so angry?

28:42.737 --> 28:44.104
We don't have time to explain.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.873
We have to get off this ship now.

28:45.907 --> 28:47.274
Where's your suit?

28:47.625 --> 28:49.810
I'm not suiting up.
There's only one helmet.

28:49.844 --> 28:52.212
Wait, then how are <i>you</i>
gonna get out of here?

28:52.247 --> 28:53.948
I'm not.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.150
No. No!

28:56.184 --> 28:57.299
Henry, you were right.

28:57.324 --> 28:58.698
What you and your
mother have is special.

28:58.723 --> 29:00.157
You don't want to lose that.

29:01.469 --> 29:03.557
You knew there was only
one helmet, didn't you?

29:04.859 --> 29:07.328
Only one of us is
gonna get back to Emma.

29:07.697 --> 29:08.997
It's gonna be you.

29:10.254 --> 29:12.522
[Grunts]

29:12.901 --> 29:14.702
[Air hisses]

29:19.674 --> 29:22.309
I was hoping you'd stay.

29:24.410 --> 29:25.477
Liam.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.815
Hello, brother.

29:28.464 --> 29:31.499
I've been waiting a long time for this.

29:36.999 --> 29:38.399
You don't have to leave.

29:38.749 --> 29:40.783
Aye, mate. I'm afraid I do.

29:40.808 --> 29:43.113
Running from Liam won't solve anything.

29:43.205 --> 29:45.239
It'll bloody well keep me alive.

29:45.715 --> 29:48.476
He won't hurt you. He's
given up on vengeance.

29:49.256 --> 29:52.180
Aye, you know why?

29:52.214 --> 29:54.711
Because he hasn't found the
man who killed his father yet.

29:54.736 --> 29:56.150
Not Liam.

29:56.185 --> 29:57.216
He wouldn't betray me like that.

29:57.241 --> 29:58.675
He's like a son to me!

29:58.821 --> 30:01.222
Liam: I was the son to
someone else once, too.

30:04.587 --> 30:05.887
Liam.

30:06.851 --> 30:08.329
Don't do this, mate.

30:08.363 --> 30:09.864
So, it's true?

30:10.386 --> 30:12.198
I know how you feel,

30:12.387 --> 30:16.286
but killing this man won't
quench that fire inside of you!

30:16.805 --> 30:20.341
You once told me how
you hunted the men down

30:20.366 --> 30:21.346
who murdered your family,

30:21.371 --> 30:23.285
how you butchered every
single one of them!

30:23.310 --> 30:24.846
But that doesn't mean that
you have to do the same.

30:24.871 --> 30:27.080
Oh, that's easy for you to
say. You got your revenge.

30:27.105 --> 30:28.973
And I've regretted it ever since.

30:29.279 --> 30:32.301
Liam, you're stronger than I was.

30:32.326 --> 30:34.694
We're so close to
finally finding a home.

30:38.455 --> 30:40.756
I'm sorry, Captain...

30:40.791 --> 30:42.692
but you're wrong.

30:42.726 --> 30:46.007
My heart is no stronger than yours.

30:46.032 --> 30:47.196
Liam!

30:47.787 --> 30:49.354
[Grunts]

30:49.488 --> 30:51.651
No. No!

30:51.675 --> 30:54.920
No! No, no, no, no, no. [Wheezing]

30:54.945 --> 30:56.695
No, no!

30:56.729 --> 30:59.689
You! You... you did this!

30:59.714 --> 31:00.844
No, I told him to let me go.

31:00.869 --> 31:03.346
No, don't you blame this on him!

31:03.371 --> 31:05.370
You're gonna pay for what you've done.

31:05.395 --> 31:07.763
You deserve better than this, brother.

31:08.324 --> 31:09.975
I hope you find it.

31:10.009 --> 31:11.476
[Quietly] No.

31:11.510 --> 31:12.344
[Cries]

31:21.320 --> 31:23.481
You've taken everything from me.

31:23.506 --> 31:25.655
First, my father, then Nemo.

31:25.690 --> 31:26.937
And that was a long time ago, mate.

31:26.962 --> 31:27.812
Why come for me now?

31:27.837 --> 31:29.204
It was not as long as you think.

31:29.229 --> 31:30.530
We made it to the Mysterious Island.

31:30.555 --> 31:31.941
We could have had a chance at life!

31:31.966 --> 31:33.407
So, what happened?

31:33.432 --> 31:34.565
Hyde.

31:34.599 --> 31:37.524
He took him, which means Nemo
died the moment he got here!

31:38.670 --> 31:41.505
All right, Hyde...
the Mysterious Island.

31:41.540 --> 31:43.174
It's the Land of Untold Stories.

31:43.208 --> 31:44.178
So what's that to you?

31:44.203 --> 31:45.569
Don't you get it?!

31:45.787 --> 31:48.281
Nemo's here, Liam. He's
here in Storybrooke.

31:48.306 --> 31:50.507
Maybe, but he's dead.

31:50.532 --> 31:52.366
Because of you!

31:52.551 --> 31:54.552
I'm not gonna hurt you, brother.

32:00.058 --> 32:01.659
[Grunts]

32:02.190 --> 32:03.204
Henry: Don't!

32:04.362 --> 32:06.764
Please, stop.

32:07.799 --> 32:09.500
Please.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.467
[Dagger clangs]

32:20.006 --> 32:21.406
Are you okay?

32:21.441 --> 32:23.242
I thought I told you to leave.

32:23.276 --> 32:25.511
And if I listened you'd be dead.

32:27.714 --> 32:30.082
I'm glad you didn't.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.484
What made you come back?

32:32.519 --> 32:34.820
You said you couldn't
ruin one more family.

32:34.854 --> 32:37.422
Neither did I.

32:38.394 --> 32:40.239
Are you saying that you
think of me as part of...

32:40.264 --> 32:41.264
Don't push it.

32:48.568 --> 32:52.471
You know why I need those shears, right?

32:53.844 --> 32:55.511
You love her, too.

32:55.536 --> 32:59.673
Aye, and if you don't want
me to use them, then I won't.

33:00.115 --> 33:03.050
But that doesn't mean that
something bad has to happen.

33:03.328 --> 33:06.205
Those visions won't come true.

33:06.230 --> 33:08.565
I can promise you that.

33:08.955 --> 33:11.445
We will find another way to save her.

33:11.470 --> 33:14.138
Yeah. But where do we start?

33:16.326 --> 33:18.126
First, we make sure we won't be tempted

33:18.151 --> 33:20.919
to take the easy way out again.

33:25.103 --> 33:26.269
[Lock clicks]

33:42.150 --> 33:44.551
Aladdin.

33:44.587 --> 33:46.287
May I?

33:46.575 --> 33:47.642
Thanks.

33:54.905 --> 33:56.306
Um...

33:57.098 --> 34:00.042
I'm sorry I ran off.

34:00.067 --> 34:03.936
I know you feel guilty...
about what you did.

34:04.606 --> 34:06.296
But there's more that
I need to tell you.

34:06.321 --> 34:08.322
I know, and I'm ready to hear it.

34:08.771 --> 34:10.905
I want to fix things.

34:11.317 --> 34:13.536
I may not be the Savior anymore,

34:13.561 --> 34:16.563
but if we go back to Agrabah,

34:16.916 --> 34:18.590
I might be able to help you restore it

34:18.614 --> 34:20.559
to what it was meant to be.

34:23.027 --> 34:26.129
[Sighs] I'm afraid we can't go back.

34:27.491 --> 34:28.420
What?

34:28.452 --> 34:29.518
Well, after you fled,

34:29.553 --> 34:33.255
I went to a neighboring
kingdom seeking an alliance.

34:34.109 --> 34:36.993
On my journey home, I was
caught in a sandstorm.

34:37.399 --> 34:40.719
The caravan pushed through
the worst of it, but...

34:40.745 --> 34:44.337
when we crested the Great Sand Dunes,

34:44.362 --> 34:45.527
it was gone.

34:47.469 --> 34:50.103
Agrabah was... gone.

35:02.456 --> 35:03.723
Any news on our patient?

35:03.757 --> 35:05.428
Oh, he's still in surgery,

35:05.453 --> 35:08.828
but Dr. Whale seems to think
that he has a fighting chance.

35:08.863 --> 35:09.829
Oh, that's great.

35:09.864 --> 35:11.164
Yeah.

35:11.198 --> 35:12.732
What'd your doctor say?

35:12.766 --> 35:16.135
Oh, I'm, uh... I'm good.
Everything looks normal.

35:16.170 --> 35:19.272
You know, so far, anyway. [Chuckles]

35:19.792 --> 35:20.974
But...?

35:23.160 --> 35:23.846
They...

35:23.871 --> 35:25.566
they gave me two copies.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.659
They said it was standard procedure.

35:28.983 --> 35:31.651
Do you want to give one to Gold?

35:32.337 --> 35:33.927
[Sighing] I do... I don't know

35:33.952 --> 35:38.456
if Rumple can ever do anything
to repair what we once had.

35:39.326 --> 35:41.461
But you hope?

35:43.338 --> 35:45.840
I don't know.

35:45.936 --> 35:49.392
But I do know that our son in our dream,

35:50.385 --> 35:53.621
he looked at Rumple with such hatred.

35:53.655 --> 35:55.956
[Sighs]

35:55.991 --> 35:57.693
I think... I think that
there might be a chance

35:57.718 --> 36:00.620
for things to turn out
differently for them.

36:01.055 --> 36:03.723
That much, I hope.

36:06.316 --> 36:08.517
[Monitor beeping steadily]

36:16.079 --> 36:18.555
Where am I, some kind of brig?

36:18.580 --> 36:22.674
[Sighs] No, mate. It's a hospital.

36:22.709 --> 36:25.982
You got quite a nasty
bump on your head, there.

36:26.007 --> 36:28.041
I'm surprised that's all you gave me.

36:28.615 --> 36:31.984
I told you, I'm not that pirate anymore.

36:32.018 --> 36:35.020
I have something to live for now.

36:35.807 --> 36:37.260
That boy, Henry.

36:37.285 --> 36:38.181
Aye.

36:38.206 --> 36:41.175
You hesitated when you saw him. Why?

36:42.701 --> 36:46.261
I realized if I kill
you in front of him,

36:46.320 --> 36:48.071
I'd just leave another boy

36:48.096 --> 36:51.398
growing up with a heart full of hate.

36:54.632 --> 36:58.635
I just wish Nemo could see
that we finally made peace.

36:58.669 --> 37:00.757
Well, maybe he can.

37:01.352 --> 37:03.019
[Gurney clattering lightly]

37:11.831 --> 37:14.399
They found him this morning.

37:16.189 --> 37:17.757
Nemo.

37:23.420 --> 37:25.755
Liam.

37:37.169 --> 37:39.296
How's Liam? Is he okay?

37:39.321 --> 37:41.056
Aye, lad. He is now.

37:41.103 --> 37:42.979
I feel like I'm still missing
a huge part of the story here.

37:43.004 --> 37:45.084
Your kid brother has a submarine,

37:45.109 --> 37:46.802
and he kidnapped you.

37:46.827 --> 37:49.862
What were you guys even doing
at the docks in the first place?

37:50.482 --> 37:52.647
Do you want to tell her or should I?

37:52.681 --> 37:55.750
It's all right. I've got this one, mate.

37:55.784 --> 37:57.719
See you at home.

37:59.822 --> 38:02.824
Okay, so...

38:02.858 --> 38:04.459
what's going on?

38:05.333 --> 38:08.359
Everything that happened
today was my fault.

38:08.384 --> 38:11.052
Henry was just trying
to help me right a wrong.

38:11.533 --> 38:13.835
What kind of wrong?

38:13.869 --> 38:17.832
When you asked me to
dispose of those shears...

38:17.857 --> 38:19.557
I didn't.

38:20.338 --> 38:24.708
I couldn't lose the one thing
that might help save you.

38:25.448 --> 38:27.616
Even if that meant you hated me,

38:27.650 --> 38:30.837
but luckily, your boy made
me see the error of my ways.

38:30.862 --> 38:33.063
And before you say anything,

38:34.093 --> 38:35.748
they're at the bottom of the ocean

38:35.773 --> 38:37.674
where they can tell no tales.

38:40.096 --> 38:42.397
It's okay. I get it.

38:45.927 --> 38:47.502
You do?

38:48.833 --> 38:51.840
I would've done the exact same thing.

38:54.444 --> 38:55.811
[Sighs]

39:01.835 --> 39:05.571
[Door opens, bell jingles]

39:05.769 --> 39:07.023
You'd only be bold enough

39:07.048 --> 39:10.017
to walk through that
door for one reason.

39:10.493 --> 39:12.507
The pirate and his son

39:12.765 --> 39:14.399
all worked things out in the end.

39:14.433 --> 39:16.868
[Chuckles]

39:16.902 --> 39:19.833
[Sighs] Insipid bunch.

39:19.903 --> 39:22.872
They really are much too
forgiving of each other.

39:22.935 --> 39:25.903
Well, forgiveness is a virtue.

39:25.938 --> 39:28.439
One I'm not particularly fond of.

39:29.068 --> 39:31.542
Aww, that's too bad.

39:31.939 --> 39:34.545
Because I've come here to make amends.

39:35.072 --> 39:39.756
You see, I've been going
about this all wrong,

39:39.781 --> 39:43.617
trying to pin the Charmings
against one another.

39:43.855 --> 39:45.418
I've forgotten the most important lesson

39:45.443 --> 39:46.610
you ever taught me.

39:49.149 --> 39:51.617
Know what you want...

39:51.652 --> 39:55.354
and go after it...

39:55.389 --> 39:57.757
with everything you have.

39:59.626 --> 40:02.862
And what is it you really want?

40:36.937 --> 40:38.871
[Moans]

40:39.185 --> 40:41.386
Me?

40:41.420 --> 40:44.556
Is that what you want?

40:44.590 --> 40:46.891
No.

40:46.926 --> 40:50.228
There's something else...

40:50.263 --> 40:53.965
but I need your help to get it.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.135
And what makes you think
I'd be willing to help?

41:00.085 --> 41:02.186
Because...

41:02.211 --> 41:04.412
fortunately for you...

41:05.376 --> 41:07.210
[Chuckles]

41:07.386 --> 41:09.228
there are still a few
underwater creatures

41:09.253 --> 41:10.720
who owe me a favor.

41:14.942 --> 41:18.244
So, tell me,

41:18.269 --> 41:22.606
what is it you need my help in getting?

41:24.141 --> 41:28.144
Oh, the one thing I've always wanted...
